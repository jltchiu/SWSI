gk0hmh49gCQ_14 0 YOU WANT TO STAY WITH THE RED IS THE YELLOWS AND THE ORANGES USING WHITES AND MAYBE THE OCCASIONAL BLUE TO COOL THINGS DOWN A LITTLE BIT
gk0hmh49gCQ_15 0 BUT REMEMBERING WHERE YOU ARE IN THE COLOR WHEEL AND MATCHING THE MIXING YOUR COLORS APPROPRIATELY IS GOING TO WORK FOR YOU IN ALL TYPES OF GARDENING BUT ESPECIALLY IN PERENNIAL GARDENING

gvKIJCe5zXY_2 0 AND YOU'LL FEEL IT IN THE TRICEPS WHICH IS THE BACK OF THE ARM AND YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO FEEL IT IN THE ABDOMINALS

gvKIJCe5zXY_6 0 SO I'M USING THIS ACTION WHICH IS TARGETING THE POSTER DELL TIGHT AS WELL AS THE LATS
gvKIJCe5zXY_7 0 SO ONCE I'VE MASTER THAT AND ONE TECHNIQUE I WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS PULLING THE ABDOMINALS AND TIGHT RATHER THAN LETTING THE ABS SINK

gvKIJCe5zXY_9 0 ONCE I'VE MASTER THAT AND FEEL COMFORTABLE I CAN START TO EXTEND THE BODY FURTHER BY EXTENDING THROUGH THE HIPS AND THAT'S WHEN YOU'LL REALLY FEEL THAT RECTOS ABDOMINALS AND TRANSVERSE ABDOMINALS PULL IN TIGHT

GxvUBMfT25M_1 0 HI I'M CARMEN LYNNE WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
GxvUBMfT25M_2 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO BE ANALYZING THIS DREAM THAT NEW HAS TOLD US ABOUT SO I'M GOING TO EFFECT TO IT AS THE RAILROAD TRACKS DREAM
GxvUBMfT25M_3 0 YOU CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT TIME OF THE NIGHT YOU USUALLY HAVE THIS DREAM
GxvUBMfT25M_4 0 YOU KNOW THAT OUT BETWEEN TEN AND TWELVE
GxvUBMfT25M_5 0 LET'S SAY I'M TOSSING YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND FALSELY THAT I KNOW THEM COMPLETELY OUT THE PROBABLY OCCURS RIGHT AFTER COMPLETELY SLEEPING IN OUT REMEMBER AND SO THEN YOU GO
GxvUBMfT25M_6 0 SO A LOT OF ON THAT STAGE THE KNOT RESTLESS ON THE D SLOW
GxvUBMfT25M_7 0 SO WE JUST SAY IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
GxvUBMfT25M_8 0 AND
GxvUBMfT25M_9 0 OH YES MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
GxvUBMfT25M_10 0 SO THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IS THE PRECOGNITIVE STAGE ISN'T IT
GxvUBMfT25M_11 0 SO REMEMBER UP
GxvUBMfT25M_12 0 ALRIGHT GREAT SO THAT WAS ONE THING THAT WE'VE WE'VE DISCOVERED NOW
GxvUBMfT25M_13 0 IT'S IN THE PRECOGNITIVE STAGE
GxvUBMfT25M_14 0 NOW THE SECOND THING I WANT TO ASK YOU IS WHAT IS THE OTHER RIDING IN MOTION THAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING IN THIS STRING
GxvUBMfT25M_15 0 I GET SWEATY FROM WHEN I GET NERVOUS NEGATE SCARE IT INTO A BASICALLY IT'S IT'S VERY STURDY DROOLING TO A POINT THE KNOT AND NOT KNOWING THE KNOWN IN KIND OF THING THAT SCARES ME IN ACTION
GxvUBMfT25M_16 0 IN THE EDGES TO KNOW HOW INTERESTING
GxvUBMfT25M_17 0 SO THE OVERRIDING IN MOTION IS ONE OF CEA
GxvUBMfT25M_18 0 SO WE HAVE A FIT A KIND OF SCAD FEELING
GxvUBMfT25M_19 0 AND THIS IS JUST TO APPLY TELL THAT IT'S THE A MOTION THAT YOUR EXPERIENCING IN THE DRAIN WHICH IS MOST SIGNIFICANT
GxvUBMfT25M_20 0 BECAUSE IF YOU DO WANT TO HAVE A DREAM SUCH AS THIS BUT HE DIDN'T FEELS DEAD IF YOU DIDN'T IF YOU'VE OUT COMPLETELY IN DIFFERENT THAN THE DREAM WOULD HAVE A WHOLE DIFFERENT MEANINGS TO HEM
GxvUBMfT25M_21 0 SO I'M NOT GOING TO BE LOOKING AT SOME OTHER ASPECTS OF THE DREAM HOW TO ANALYZE THOSE
G52icoH5-nM_1 0 HI I'M MICHAEL SETO
G52icoH5-nM_2 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO LIGHT A PIECE OF PLEXIGLASS FROM BELOW TO ACHIEVE THE WHITE BACKGROUND FOR PIECE OF JEWELRY
G52icoH5-nM_3 0 SO WHAT WE DO IS INSTEAD OF HAVING THE PLEXIGLASS FLAT ON THE TABLE AND I JUST GOT A COUPLE PIECES OF STYROFOAM THAT CAME OUT OF A BOX HOLDING A SOME ELECTRONIC HERE
G52icoH5-nM_4 0 AND I JUST PUT IT RIGHT HERE UNDERNEATH THE PLEXIGLASS
G52icoH5-nM_5 0 SO THAT'S OFF THE GROUND WE'VE GOT THE JEWELRY ON TOP AS WELL AS THE LIGHT SITTING GO ON IT
G52icoH5-nM_6 0 SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO LIKE THIS UNDERNEATH
G52icoH5-nM_7 0 WE NEED TO GET A LIGHT UNDER THERE TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF BACK LIGHTING AND ELIMINATE THE PLEXIGLASS
G52icoH5-nM_8 0 SO WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS OUR LIKE IT'S GOING TO GO UNDERNEATH
G52icoH5-nM_9 0 NOTICE I CHOSE OF FLUORESCENT BULBS BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS COOL OR AS WELL THE COLOR OF THESE FLUORESCENT BULBS MATCHES THE FLUORESCENT BULBS IN BY OTHER TWO OVERHEAD LAMPS
G52icoH5-nM_10 0 AND THAT'S GOING TO MAKE GETTING THE WHITE BALANCE EASY
G52icoH5-nM_11 0 SO IT'S CRITICAL TO TRY AND BACK LIGHT JEWELRY IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET A PURE WHITE BACKGROUND AND THE WAY OF DOING THAT THAT I THINK THE BEST WAY OF DOING THAT IS A PIECE OF CLEAR WHITE PLEXIGLASS IT'S GOING TO ALLOW THE LIGHT TO COME THROUGH AND GIVE YOU THAT WHITE BACKGROUND WITHOUT OVEREXPOSING THE JEWELRY ITSELF
GBlTwqDx5-A_1 0 NEXT UP I'LL BE DISCUSSING THE RAIN STICK
GBlTwqDx5-A_2 0 NOW HERE'S A RAIN STICK
GBlTwqDx5-A_3 0 THEY COME IN VARIOUS SIZES

GBlTwqDx5-A_11 0 NOW THE SPIKES OR LITTLE TINES THAT ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE CACTUS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF AND HAMMERED INTO THE NORM OUT OF HERE SO THAT THEY STICK INTO THE EMPTY CAVITY INSIDE THE RAIN STICK
GBlTwqDx5-A_12 0 THE ENDS OF AND CUT OFF AND VERY SMALL STILLINGS OF AND PLACED IN HERE SO WHEN YOU KAPUT BACK ON AS YOU TILT THE RAIN STICK THE SMALL STONES RUN INTO THE TIMES OF THE CACTUS ON THE INSIDE CREATING THE SOUND THAT YOU HERE

GVssAhApfGg_2 0 AND THINNER MEDICINE WE ARE ALWAYS AT RISK OF GETTING BITTEN BY ONE OF THESE ANIMALS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON
GVssAhApfGg_3 0 CATS UNFORTUNATELY HAVE A LOT OF BACTERIA IN THEIR MOUTHS AND CAN LITERALLY IN JACK THAT BACTERIA IN TO YOU
GVssAhApfGg_4 0 CATS HAVE LARGE CANINE TEAS WHICH ARE USED FOR PROTECTION

HjM5F0tiasY_8 0 SO IF IF I MADE IN OFFERING SHANNON MADE A STRONG WALK LIKE I SAID I'M WHICH YOU LIKE TO PUT MY BUNNY RABBIT
HjM5F0tiasY_9 0 SINCE THE BUNNY RABBIT
HjM5F0tiasY_10 0 IT'S A PAINTING WITH
HjM5F0tiasY_11 0 THAT WOULD BE A BLOCK
HjM5F0tiasY_12 0 I SAY THE BUNNY RABBIT HE SAYS IT'S A PAYING ONE
HjM5F0tiasY_13 0 HE'S DENYING THE REALITY THAT I'M TRYING TO CREATE
HjM5F0tiasY_14 0 THERE'S A SOFT BLOCK WHICH IS JUST BEING NEGATIVE UP GRUMPY YOUR OR JUST THE HOOP TO ABOUT ABOUT THE OFFER
HjM5F0tiasY_15 0 AND IT AND IT PREVENTS THINGS FROM MOVING FORWARD
HjM5F0tiasY_16 0 SO HERE WE GO AGAIN
HjM5F0tiasY_17 0 WHAT YOU LIKE THIS PET MY BUNNY RABBIT
HjM5F0tiasY_18 0 ANYBODY RABBITS STEAM
HjM5F0tiasY_19 0 ALRIGHT SO THAT'S A BLOCK YOU KNOW YOU JUST SAY NO
HjM5F0tiasY_20 0 WE CAN'T MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS WHOLE BUNNY RABBIT PADDING SCENE

HjM5F0tiasY_27 0 AND THEN I'M GOING TO DO THE SAME I'M GOING TO MAKE AN OFFER AND HE'S GOING TO SHUT DOWN MY OFFER
HjM5F0tiasY_28 0 THIS IS REALLY THE HEELS OF TREES REALLY MUSHROOMS
HjM5F0tiasY_29 0 THAT'S A SHOE BOX
HjM5F0tiasY_30 0 WHAT YOU PREFER THE DIAMOND TO EARRINGS ALL OF THE PEARLS
HjM5F0tiasY_31 0 I DON'T EVEN HAVE ANY EARS
HjM5F0tiasY_33 0 THESE ARE BLOCKS AND YOU CAN EITHER KIND OF FUNNY

HjM5F0tiasY_42 0 OF COURSE SOMETIMES IN SCENES YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO BLOCK
HjM5F0tiasY_43 0 YOU'RE GOING TO SAY NO TO THE OTHER CHARACTER BUT IT SHOULD BE AN IMPORTANT MOMENT
HjM5F0tiasY_44 0 IT SHOULD BE SAYING NO FOR A REASON
HjM5F0tiasY_45 0 OFTEN TIMES WE BLOCK JUST BECAUSE WE'RE FEELING NERVOUS
HjM5F0tiasY_46 0 OR FEELING DEFENSIVE OR WE WANT TO CONTROL WHAT'S GOING ON AND PUT OUR OWN IDEAS OUT THERE
HjM5F0tiasY_47 0 THOSE ARE GOOD REASONS TO SAY NO TO OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS
HjM5F0tiasY_48 0 USUALLY BLOCK OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS WHEN IT REALLY SERVES THE STORY

gMl0CV6QweM_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS MIKE LEWIS WITH CHRISTIAN MARTIAL ARTS
gMl0CV6QweM_2 0 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO SPIN AROUND A BETTER STAFF
gMl0CV6QweM_3 0 THERE'S MANY MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT ABOVE STUFF AROUND SO YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T REALLY LARGE SOFT AND ONE
gMl0CV6QweM_4 0 THE BEST THING TO DO IS GO ONTO YOUR BACK YARD JUST EXPERIMENTING AROUND WITH IT AND SEE OR REALLY WORKS FOR YOU
gMl0CV6QweM_5 0 TO START WITH A FEW BASICS OBVIOUSLY JUST THE JUST SOMETHING THAT THERE'S REALLY NOT PRACTICAL BUT IT JUST LOOKS COOL
gMl0CV6QweM_6 0 YOU KNOW YOU CAN ADD IT INTO YOUR FORMS OR INTO YOUR CAUSE OR ANYTHING THAT YOU MAKE UP IS A JUST TO TAKE THE BEST THAT SPIN AROUND AND TAKE ONE HAND OFF CATCH ON THE OTHER SIDE AND JUST CONTINUE TO FLIP THE LEFT OR RIGHT HAND WHICH EVER YOU START OUT WITH
gMl0CV6QweM_7 0 I'M STARTING WITH MY LEFT HAND HERE AND JUST FLIPPING IT AROUND
gMl0CV6QweM_8 0 JUST MAKE SURE YOU KEEP IT NEAR THE CENTER
gMl0CV6QweM_9 0 IF YOU GET ALL THINGS START SLIDING DOWN WHICH IS VERY EASY YOUR WEIGHT'S GOING TO BE ON EVENLY DISTRIBUTED AND YOU CAN POSSIBLY SABAR STAFF
gMl0CV6QweM_10 0 ANOTHER WAY ADDING IN STRIKES INTO SPINNING YOUR BOW STAFF IS TO TAKE THE LEFT HAND A PALM DOWN RIGHT HAND PALM UP
gMl0CV6QweM_11 0 I DO IS I TAKE A SPIN IT AROUND YOUR ARMS ACROSS THAT I LAY IT UP AGAINST MY BODY TO THE SIDE AND THAT'S ACTUALLY STRIKE AND OF ITSELF BUT THEN YOU CAN TURN THAT INTO A SPIN BY TAKING IT ON FOR CROSSING YOUR ARMS CHANGING YOUR HANDS POSITIONS GUYS NOW YOUR RIGHT HAND IS PALM DOWN LEFT HAND PALM UP
gMl0CV6QweM_12 0 SPIN IT ACROSS YOUR ARMS AND LAY IT DOWN SO IF YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER YOU JUST GO BACK AND FORTH JUST LIKE THAT
gMl0CV6QweM_13 0 YOU WANT TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INTRICATE WITH THAT YOU BEGIN TO SCOOT
gMl0CV6QweM_14 0 YOU TAKE YOUR HANDS SAME POSITION RIGHT HAND PALM UP LEFT HAND PALM DOWN
gMl0CV6QweM_15 0 CROSS AROUND LATE UP AGAINST YOUR BODY AND WHAT YOU DO THESE SCOOP DOWN CHANGE YOUR HANDS NOW YOU SCOOP DOWN TO THE OTHER SIDE AND IT'S ACTUALLY CONTINUOUS SPINNING OF THE BOW STUFF
gMl0CV6QweM_16 0 YOU JUST HAVE TO LEARN TO CHANGE YOUR HANDS AT THE RIGHT TIME AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE STAYING IN THE CENTER OF THE BEST THAT SO THOSE ARE JUST TWO THREE WE BASIC WAYS TO BE ABLE TO SPIN YOUR BOW STUFF AROUND AND GET STARTED
gMl0CV6QweM_17 0 AGAIN EXPERIMENT WITH IT
gMl0CV6QweM_18 0 GOT INTO YOUR BACKYARD AND GIVE IT A TRY
hd7AD_RfIec_1 0 ALRIGHT NOW UP THIS IS OUR OTHER SCENARIO
hd7AD_RfIec_2 0 WE'VE DETERMINED THAT THE WATER LEVEL MAY BE HEY COME UP TOO HIGH AND WAS RUNNING THE TAP OF THE OVERFLOW TUBE
hd7AD_RfIec_3 0 SO THAT TELLS US WITH THE BALL KAYAK EITHER NEEDS A NEW WASHER AND NEEDS TO BE REBUILT OR WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT
hd7AD_RfIec_4 0 WELL FIRST WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THIS ONE
hd7AD_RfIec_5 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE WHERE TO GO UNDERNEATH WE HAVE ALREADY HAVE A SHUT THE WATER OFF WE'RE DISCONNECTING THE SUPPLY LINE AND THE BOTTOM OF THE BALL CUT
hd7AD_RfIec_6 0 IN THIS CASE IT'S WHEN THE BRAIDED ONES IT'S VERY EASY TO UNDO
hd7AD_RfIec_7 0 AND GET THEM ON AND DO THE BALL DOWN THAT THAT HOLDS THE BALL BACK TO THE TANK
hd7AD_RfIec_8 0 THIS IS THE IMPORTANT NOT BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT KEEPS HIM FROM DRIPPING ON THE FLOOR THESE V THIS SEAL RIGHT THERE ON THE BAR
hd7AD_RfIec_9 0 SO WE TAKE THE OLD ONE OUT
hd7AD_RfIec_10 0 THIS IS A CORKY
hd7AD_RfIec_11 0 THIS IS A VERY NICE BALL CRACK
hd7AD_RfIec_12 0 IF WE TAKE THIS POT CRACKED BUT WHAT I REALLY LIKE IS THE MAIN STEEL BALL CRACK
hd7AD_RfIec_13 0 THIS UNIT IS ALL BRAS
hd7AD_RfIec_14 0 IT TAKES IT FEELS VERY QUICKLY AND AS THE QUIETEST OF ALL THE BALLCOCKS THAT YOU CAN ON
hd7AD_RfIec_15 0 SO IF YOU WILL HAVE A TOILET NEXT TO A BEDROOM OR AN AREA THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ENJOY IT TO THE QUITE NEST AND OR THE QUICK FILLING TIME YOU GO FIND YOURSELF A MANSFIELD OVER SEVENTY BARK
hd7AD_RfIec_16 0 THE DRAFT IN THE TANK CENTER IT WITHOUT NOT TIGHTER DOWN
hd7AD_RfIec_17 0 YOU CAN SEE ALREADY THAT WE HAVE TO LONG ABOUT TWELVE RIDE BUT THAT'S NO PROBLEM
hd7AD_RfIec_18 0 WE'RE IN OUR STORE TO REPLACE IT WITH THE SHORTER
hd7AD_RfIec_19 0 WE GET THIS ANCHOR DOWN
hd7AD_RfIec_20 0 IT'S JAB USUALLY REQUIRES A PAIR OF CHANNEL LOCKS
hd7AD_RfIec_21 0 A PAIR FOR FORTIES RESET MEDIUM SIZE IS PRETTY NICE
hd7AD_RfIec_22 0 NICE AND TAKE THE TANK AND IT'S SECURE
hd7AD_RfIec_23 0 I'M GOING TO TAKE WITH THIS APART IRON MAN CAN ACT IN AND THEN WE'LL HAVE THIS ALL SET TO GO
gGpIriUEVOw_1 0 THE NEXT THING YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS ACTUALLY MASSAGE THE ELBOW ITSELF ACTUALLY PUTTING PRESSURE ALL THE WAY AROUND NICE CIRCULAR MOTION WITH YOUR FINGERS ABOVE AND BELOW THE JOINT FRONT AND BACK ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH ALONG THE FRONT OF THE LEG
gGpIriUEVOw_2 0 THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MAY ALSO BE A PROBLEM
gGpIriUEVOw_3 0 WITH THE DOG WITH ELBOW DISPLAY YOU MAY FIND THE DOG DOESN'T LIKE THIS MASSAGE TO START WITH IN WHICH CASE YOU WANT TO START WITH JUST SOME SOFT GENTLE MOVEMENT JUST MOVE YOUR HANDS OVER THE SKIN DON'T PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON AND GRADUALLY WORK YOUR WAY UP
gGpIriUEVOw_4 0 IF YOU FEEL HEAT IN THE JOINT YOU MAY FIND THAT THE DOG WILL ALSO OBJECTIVE IT AND IN THIS CASE IS JUST DON'T DO AS MUCH OF IT JUST DO A MINUTE OR TWO SEE LITTLE TOLERATE AND THEN TRY AGAIN THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE DOING A SESSION AND GRADUALLY WORK YOUR WAY UP YOU'LL FIND THAT THIS WILL GET EASIER AS YOU'VE WORKED WITH THE ANIMAL AND THE GENERAL ENERGY IS FLOWING AND SOME OF THE STIFFNESS IS RELIEVED THEN THEY'RE GOING TO BE MORE LIKELY TO TOLERATE THIS PARTICULAR AREA BEING MASSAGE
hIubyjPBr4A_1 0 OKAY THE NEXT STEP THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS ACTUALLY START ATTACHING SOME OF THIS STUFF TOGETHER BEFORE WE'RE ABLE TO HANG IT UP
hIubyjPBr4A_2 0 I ALWAYS LIKE TO REEF CYCLE EVERYTHING GUY POSSIBLY CAN SO I'LL TAKE THIS THE ENDS OF A FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS I DON'T USE AND CUT OFF AND ANCHOR USE THOSE FOR TOOLS
hIubyjPBr4A_3 0 ONE WAY TO ANCHOR THIS PIECE INTO THIS PIECE IS TAKEN IT LITERALLY DRIVE THE PEG DOWN INTO IT USING THE THE THE THE ENDS OF THE STEMS AND HITTING IT WITH SOME HOT GLUE GUN SO THAT IT WILL STAY
hIubyjPBr4A_4 0 AND THEN YOU COULD TAKE THIS IS JUST PUSH IT ON DOWN AND ATTACH IT
hIubyjPBr4A_5 0 PLACE IT WHERE YOU WOULD LIKE IT TO BE
hIubyjPBr4A_6 0 THE NEXT THING IS TRYING TO ATTACH THE HELL CUT ANY IT'S A VERY HEAVY FLOWER
hIubyjPBr4A_7 0 TAKING THAT SAME WIRE WHAT I'VE DONE IS A CUT IT IN PIECES WE'RE AND BEND IT AROUND SO THAT YOU HAVE TO USE A CLAMP AND I TRY TO ATTACH IT WHERE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SEEN BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE'VE COVERED THIS WITH THE SILK FLOWERS I NEED TO PUT THE HOLE IN THE FLOWERS WITH AN EXACTO KNIFE TO GET IT DOWN IN THERE
hIubyjPBr4A_8 0 AND AGAIN YOU COULD HIT WITH THE HOT GLUE GUN TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO STAY
hIubyjPBr4A_9 0 AND THE OTHER THING THAT WILL HELP YOU DO IS ON THIS PIECE IS GOING ACROSS I'M GOING TO HAVE THE BAMBOO GOING DOWN INTO IT SO AGAIN USING A KNIFE EXACTO KNIFE CUTTING RIGHT INTO THE HOLE THAT CUTTING A LITTLE X INTO THE LEAF ON BOTH SIDES TO IT SO THAT WHEN YOU PUSH THIS DOWN THROUGH THIS THE HOLE
hIubyjPBr4A_10 0 OKAY IT'S ATTACHED TO THIS AND THEN WE CAN DO THE SAME THING BY TOUCHING THIS WITH THE PIN FROM THAT THIS ONE TO THIS PIECE SO THEN YOU'RE STARTING TO ATTACH A PIECE THAT YOU CAN HANG IT
hIubyjPBr4A_11 0 SO THE NEXT THING YOU NEED TO DO IS START ATTACHING YOUR PIECES TOGETHER ON A HORIZONTAL SURFACE THAT WILL BE HEAVIER A CONSTRUCTION SO IT'S EASIER THE TRYING TO DO IT WELL IT'S HANGING ON A VERTICAL
hIubyjPBr4A_12 0 SO THAT'S OUR YOUR PIECES AND BEFORE YOU HANG IT UP ON THE VERTICAL

gmlvsCma0hw_14 0 FROM HERE JUMP DUE TO SPINS
gmlvsCma0hw_15 0 THERE WE GO AND DON'T ALLOW YOUR FEET
gmlvsCma0hw_16 0 SO IF I'M JUMP TO SPIN
gmlvsCma0hw_18 0 AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A JUMP SEVEN TWENTY SPIN

G74u7ZXm550_7 0 IS IT GOING TO BE SANTA CLAUS
G74u7ZXm550_8 0 IS IT GOING TO BE RED AND WHITE
G74u7ZXm550_9 0 IT'S GOING TO BE GREEN WHITE GLUE IN WINE BLUE AND SILVER
G74u7ZXm550_10 0 YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU HALF AND WHAT YOU NEED
G74u7ZXm550_11 0 GO THROUGH YOUR TABLE LINENS
G74u7ZXm550_12 0 IF I WANT TO HAVE A RED WHITE THEME YOU SHOULD HAVE SOME RED WHITE TABLE LINENS
G74u7ZXm550_13 0 CHECK TO SEE WHAT YOU HAVE
G74u7ZXm550_14 0 IF YOU DECIDE YOU'RE GOING TO DO A SILVER PARTY AND YOU HAVE NOTHING SILVER THEN IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG EXPENSE AND TAKE THAT INTO YOUR BUDGET
G74u7ZXm550_15 0 I'VE COLLECTED A FEW THINGS AROUND MY HOUSE TO DECIDE WHAT MY THEME IS GOING TO BE
G74u7ZXm550_16 0 I HAVE PLATES A GLASS OF FLOWERS AND DECORATIONS AND LINENS AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO SET THE TABLE
G74u7ZXm550_17 0 I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOUR THEME IS GOING TO BE
hFELIz1icak_1 0 THIS EXAMPLE I'M GOING TO SHOW A VARIATION OF FINGER STYLE PATTERN IS IN ITS UP WITH A MINOR CHORD AGAIN
hFELIz1icak_2 0 AND IN THIS ONE OUT IT I'M GOING TO SHOW IT TO PATCHES USED IN THE PATTERN INSTEAD OF JUST ONE THIS I'M GOING TO USE TWO UTILIZING JUST THE OPEN NOTE IN BETWEEN THE PATCHES
hFELIz1icak_3 0 SO I'M GOING TO DO HERE IS GO
hFELIz1icak_4 0 BASICALLY WHAT I'M DOING THERE IS TWO PATCHES
hFELIz1icak_5 0 TO PATCHES BETWEEN THE AND THE HIGH E STRING
hFELIz1icak_6 0 AND THEN HIT THE G AND THEN A PINCH BETWEEN THE D IN THIS CASE WITH FRETTING WITH MAKES AN E NOTE WITH E ID AND THE OPEN B OR TO ACTUALLY I'LL BE IT'S A B C FIRST FINGER ON THE SECOND FRET ON THE A MINOR CHORD
hFELIz1icak_7 0 SO SLOWLY IT'S GOING TO BE AND
hFELIz1icak_8 0 AND AGAIN USING TWO PATCHES THAT AND WITH THE NOTE IN BETWEEN EACH ONE
hFELIz1icak_9 0 AND WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING IT FROM THE UP TO A FASTER SPEED THAT SOUNDS NICE AS A FOUR SOUNDS
hFELIz1icak_10 0 SO TO PLAY IT UP TO SPEED
hFELIz1icak_11 0 AND THAT'S ANOTHER VARIATION OF THE FIRE STOP PATTERN IS IN THE KEY OF A MINOR
gJ8Tcumwnlw_1 0 WHEN YOU'RE SWIMMING AGGRESSIVELY IN COLOR AND A LOT OF TIME TO RESCUE SITUATION YOU NEED TO ACCESS MIDSTREAM BALL SIDE OF THE OR THE EIGHTIES
gJ8Tcumwnlw_2 0 IN THIS REQUIRES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SKILL BUT ALSO ENTERING IN THE RIGHT PLACE REALLY COUNTS FOR A LOT
gJ8Tcumwnlw_3 0 JUST LIKE IN A KAYAK ROTH YOUR CANOE YOU WANT THE ENDS AND THESE AS HIGH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN
gJ8Tcumwnlw_4 0 SO FOR EXAMPLE OF WITH SWIMMING DOWN THIS CARD AND AGAIN AND SEE ENTER INTO THE EDDY OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGH ENOUGH FOLDER
gJ8Tcumwnlw_5 0 THE ENDS UP NICE AND HIGH AGGRESSIVELY SWIMMING IN A CROLL TYPE STROKE TO GET INTO THE EDDY
gJ8Tcumwnlw_6 0 ONCE YOU HIT THE EDDY LINE YOU CAN THEN STOP POWER ROLLING DOWN STREAM
gJ8Tcumwnlw_7 0 WHAT THIS DOES IS IT STOPS YOUR BODY FROM GETTING SWUM PARALLEL TO THE RIBBON CARDS AND GETTING STALL RIDES ON THE EDDY LINE THAT HELPS YOU PENETRATE ALL THE WAY INTO THE EDDY
G-TMtHTXJVM_1 0 SO NEXT WE'RE GOING TO CONCENTRATE ON THAT MIDDLE PORTION OF THE SUN CITATION
G-TMtHTXJVM_2 0 SO OUR DOWNWARD FACING DOG TO OUR PLANK TO OUR CHATTER ON THAT TO OUR UPWARD FACING DOG
G-TMtHTXJVM_3 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THAT MIDDLE PART CHOOSING SOME KNEELING OPTIONS FOR THOSE POSES
G-TMtHTXJVM_4 0 SO AS WE'VE STEPS BACK WITH OUR RIGHT LEG INTO A NICE DEEP LAUNCH FROM HERE IF WE WANT TO CHOOSE THE KNEELING OPTIONS WILL DROP TO THE KNEE IN ON CURL THE TOE
G-TMtHTXJVM_5 0 AND THEN FROM HERE WILL BRING THE LEFT LEG BACK AND WE'LL FIND EXTENDED CHILD'S POSE
G-TMtHTXJVM_6 0 WE'RE SITTING BACK ONTO HER HEELS REACHING OUR ARMS AWAY YOUR HANDS ARE ABOUT SHOULD SHOULDER DISTANCE APART HERE
G-TMtHTXJVM_7 0 AND FROM HERE AS WE INHALE FOR AGAIN BRING OUR SHOULDERS OVER OUR WRIST TO FIND A OILING PLANK POSITION
G-TMtHTXJVM_8 0 AND THEN TO FIND CHAD URANGA IN THE KNEELING POSITION IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE FULL POSITION WILL SHIFT SLOWLY FORWARD LOWERING HER ELBOWS TIGHT TO THE BODY
G-TMtHTXJVM_9 0 NOW THIS IS WHERE IT GETS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT
G-TMtHTXJVM_10 0 RATHER THAN UPWARD FACING DOG WE'RE GOING TO LOWER ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND LIFTING THE CHEST
G-TMtHTXJVM_11 0 JUST SLIGHTLY FOR A LITTLE TINY BB COBRA
G-TMtHTXJVM_12 0 AND FROM HERE WILL PUSH BACK UP AND COMING BACK TO EXTENDED CHILD'S POSE
G-TMtHTXJVM_13 0 AND KEEP HIM FROM EXTENDED CHILD'S POSE WE WANT TO COME UP AND BRING THAT RIGHT FOOT BACK BETWEEN HAND A LITTLE HARDER WHEN YOU'RE KNEELING PREFERENCE
h4wXfn9IwSo_1 0 MY NAME IS ANTHONY METAL MONEY AND I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO BECOME A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER
h4wXfn9IwSo_2 0 MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER IS A PHOTOGRAPHER THAT REALLY WHERE THIS A LOT OF HATS SO TO SPEAK
h4wXfn9IwSo_3 0 A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER AND PHOTOGRAPH THE EXHIBITS GOING ON A MUSEUM MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER CAN ALSO TAKE IMAGES OF THE MUSEUMS COLLECTIONS
h4wXfn9IwSo_4 0 SO THAT IS ONE PART ABOUT BEING A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER THAT REQUIRES QUITE A BIT OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE AND HOW TO PHOTOGRAPH DOCUMENT IS HOW TO PHOTOGRAPH ARTWORK PAINTINGS YOU MIGHT EVEN BE PHOTOGRAPHING PHOTOGRAPHS
h4wXfn9IwSo_5 0 SO DOING THAT IS ACTUALLY PRETTY INTERESTING YOU'LL BE USING STROBE YOU MIGHT EVEN BE USING DIGITAL SCANNERS SHOULD BE USING DIGITAL CAMERAS MAYBE EASY FILM CAMERAS
h4wXfn9IwSo_6 0 ALL THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TOOLS THAT ARE AT THE PHOTOGRAPHERS TOOL BOX SO TO SPEAK WILL CREATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF IMAGES FOR A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER
h4wXfn9IwSo_7 0 THERE'S ALSO QUITE A BIT OF COPYRIGHT THAT YOU HAVE TO NOW CAN I DO THIS
h4wXfn9IwSo_8 0 ONE REALLY INTERESTING TERM I HEARD OF USING A PHOTOGRAPHER WANT SAID IS THAT I'M NOT IMPROVING UPON ART MEANING THAT YOU ARE JUST PHOTOGRAPHING THE ART WORK
h4wXfn9IwSo_9 0 YOU'RE NOT REALLY TRYING TO MAKE THAT PAINTING OR SCULPTURE ANY BETTER YOU'RE JUST DOCUMENTING IT
h4wXfn9IwSo_10 0 I HAVE SET THAT WAS REALLY AN INTERESTING WAY TO LOOK AT IT
h4wXfn9IwSo_11 0 ONE OTHER WAY TO LOOK AT IT TOO IS THAT PAINTINGS DON'T TALK BACK
h4wXfn9IwSo_12 0 I'M PHOTOGRAPHER THAT PHOTOGRAPHS A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THESE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PERSONALITIES ON PHOTOGRAPHING
h4wXfn9IwSo_13 0 WHEN I AM PHOTOGRAPHING A PAINTING OUR PIECE OF ART WORK IN THE STUDIO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING BACK TO ME WHETHER IT BE POSITIVE ARE GOOD OR THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE THEIR PICTURE TAKEN
h4wXfn9IwSo_14 0 SO THAT'S KIND OF COOL ON SUNDAY SO I JUST WANT PHOTOGRAPH SOMETHING AND NOT BE BOTHERED
h4wXfn9IwSo_15 0 SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE WAYS THAT YOU CAN BECOME A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER AND AGAIN I WOULD ALSO SPEND A DAY WITH A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHERS TO IT'S LIKE
h4wXfn9IwSo_16 0 SEE IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN
h4wXfn9IwSo_17 0 AND I'VE KNOWN TO CERTAIN PROGRAMS THAT YOU CAN ARCHIVIST PROGRAMS OR YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT A MUSEUM DOES
h4wXfn9IwSo_18 0 THAT IS SOME OF THE TIPS THAT I WOULD SAY TO SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BECOME A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER
gImBKT9w0Mk_1 0 HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
gImBKT9w0Mk_2 0 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN OUR CENTER GOES DOWN TO SNAP THE BALL THAT WE DON'T GET ANY PENALTIES
gImBKT9w0Mk_3 0 NOW ONE PENALTY OBVIOUSLY IS THE OFF SIDES PENALTY
gImBKT9w0Mk_4 0 A LOT OF TIMES THAT COMES FROM A GUY THAT IS EITHER NOT LISTENING TO THE CADENCE HE'S NOT WATCHING THE BALL OR IT'S TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE BALL TO MAKE THE MISTAKE ANY JUMPS OFF SIDES PREMATURELY
gImBKT9w0Mk_5 0 THERE CAN BE OFF SIDES CALL AGAINST THE CENTER FOR MOVING OR WHAT WE CALL MANIPULATING THE BALL TO THROW OFF THE DEFENSE
gImBKT9w0Mk_6 0 SO A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS WHEN HE GOES DOWN ON THE BALL HE'S GOT TO GET SET
gImBKT9w0Mk_7 0 A LOT OF TIMES GO AHEAD AND LET THE BALL THE BALL WILL BE LAYING ON THE GROUND IT MAY EVEN BE TURN TO THE SIDE
gImBKT9w0Mk_8 0 HE'S ALLOWED TO GRAB THAT BALL AND GO AHEAD AND GET SET BUT ONCE HE GETS THAT BALL SET HE CAN'T BE MOVING IT
gImBKT9w0Mk_9 0 HE CAN'T BE TILTS IN THE BACK TO HIM BECAUSE THIS GUY MAYBE THINK HE'S TRYING TO MAKE THE SNAP
gImBKT9w0Mk_10 0 YOU DEFINITELY CANNOT LIFT THE BALL UP AT ANY POINT IN TIME
gImBKT9w0Mk_11 0 YOU CAN'T LIFTED OR MOVE IT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT OR REPOSITION IT
gImBKT9w0Mk_12 0 ANYTIME THAT BALL COMES UP WORDS MOVE IF DEFENSES CATCH IT THAT'S GOING TO BE CALLED AS AN OFF SIDES
gImBKT9w0Mk_13 0 SO ONCE YOU GET THAT BALL LOCKED IN READY YOU GOT TO KEEP RIGHT THERE
gImBKT9w0Mk_14 0 YOU CAN'T BE MOVING THAT BALL AROUND
gImBKT9w0Mk_15 0 THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO THE COST YOUR TEAM FIVE YARDS
GrBZZfFbDog_1 0 ANY TIME THAT YOU ARE OUTSIDE PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE SPENDING TIME OUTSIDE BY YOURSELF YOU WANT TO BE SURE THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF ALLERGIES TO INSECT BITES ARE THINGS THAT YOU ARE WELL PREPARED FOR IT
GrBZZfFbDog_2 0 IF YOU HAVE AN UP AND THAT FROM PEN BE SURE THAT YOU KEEP THAT HANDY WITH YOU AND I MIGHT ALWAYS BE A GOOD IDEA IF IF YOU HAVE SERIOUS ALLERGIES TO BEES IN WASPS IN AND THAT SORT OF THING THAT YOU JUST CHECK IN WITH SOMEBODY BEFORE YOU GO SPEND YOUR TIME OUTSIDE AND THEN THAT YOU CHECK BACK IN WITH THEM AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME
GrBZZfFbDog_3 0 AND THAT WAY JUST SORT OF PUT SOMEBODY ON THE LOWER IF THEY HAVE IN HER BACK FROM YOU
GrBZZfFbDog_4 0 YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN ACCIDENTS AN ACCIDENTAL STING IS GOING TO HAPPEN OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T PLAN FOR ACCIDENTS
GrBZZfFbDog_5 0 SO IT'S A SERIOUS CONSIDERATION
GrBZZfFbDog_6 0 BE SURE TO KEEP YOUR UP IN A FRIEND YOU'RE BETTER DRILL WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU NEED IN TO A USE AN EMERGENCY HANDY AND THAT WILL HELP YOU FEEL SAFE AND RELAXED OUTSIDE
H3kuHP_DqR4_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO SHOW HOW TO INSTALL A WINDOW IN THE SAIL
H3kuHP_DqR4_2 0 SO DURING THE LAYOUT PROCESS WE PUT THEM MARKS ON THE ON THE PANEL WHERE THE WINDOW IS GOING TO GO
H3kuHP_DqR4_3 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO USE A TWENTY GAGE CLEAR VINYL FOR THE WINDOW
H3kuHP_DqR4_4 0 SO I'M JUST GOING TO MAKE A ROUGH CUT ON THE VINYL A BIGGER THAN OR WINDOW AND THEN WILL STAY TAKE THE WINDOW UNDER THE PANEL AND MAKE THE PROPER CATS AND SIZE IT PROPERLY
H3kuHP_DqR4_5 0 ONE THING TO REMEMBER IS ALWAYS THAT CUT THE PANEL BEFORE YOU STICK THE WINDOW ON
H3kuHP_DqR4_6 0 SO RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO PUT IN AUSTIN TATIN PANEL
H3kuHP_DqR4_7 0 SO FOR THE WINDOW WE'VE ALREADY DRAWN THE WINDOW PERIMETER AND NOW I'M GOING TO LAY DOWN STICKY TAPE ALONG WINDOW PERIMETER
H3kuHP_DqR4_8 0 THE KEY TO GOOD TAPING IT IS TO LET THE TAPE RELAXES IT HITS THE CLOTH
H3kuHP_DqR4_9 0 SO THERE WE HAVE THE TAPE
H3kuHP_DqR4_10 0 WILL PEEL ONE EDGE SHIN STICKIES ON THEM
H3kuHP_DqR4_11 0 YOU WANT TO POP VINYL AND NOT WHOLE LONG TAPE BECAUSE THE VINYL WILL STRETCH AND THEN SHRINK IS IT HITS THE CLOTH AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THE WRINKLY WINDOW
H3kuHP_DqR4_12 0 IF YOU TRIM CLOCKWISE AROUND YOU CAN GET THE SCISSOR EDGE RIGHT NEXT TO THE TAPE
H3kuHP_DqR4_13 0 ON THE CLAW OFFSIDE GETTING THE SCISSORS RIGHT NEXT TO THE TAPE WILL HELP PREVENT FRAMING
H3kuHP_DqR4_14 0 AFTER CUTTING THE VINYL OFF YOU CAN FLIP THE PANEL OVER AND CUT OUT THE CLOTH IN THE BACK SIDE
H3kuHP_DqR4_15 0 NOW WE'VE ALREADY MADE OUR SLIT IN THE CLOTH
H3kuHP_DqR4_16 0 YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU HAVEN'T MADE A SLIT AND AFTER YOU SO IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE CELL CLOTH WITHOUT POKE A HOLE IN THE VINYL TOO
H3kuHP_DqR4_17 0 SO DON'T FORGET TO MAKE YOUR SLIP MOVEMENTS
H3kuHP_DqR4_18 0 I SO THERE WE HAVE A FINISHED WHEN THEY'RE IN THE SAIL
H3kuHP_DqR4_19 0 WE'LL GO AHEAD AND TAKE THIS MACHINE AND SEW BOTH EDGES THE PERIMETER
H3kuHP_DqR4_20 0 SO TWO ROWS OF SEWING ALL THE WAY AROUND THE WINDOW

HIathOhxbIQ_1 0 ALRIGHT NOW LET'S LEARN HOW TO DO BOUGHT MOSS ON LYING ON THE SIDE
HIathOhxbIQ_2 0 MAKE SURE YOU ARE ENGAGED
HIathOhxbIQ_3 0 SO THE HEAD IS RELAXED AND THE ARMPIT IS RELAX THE SPINE IS LONG MAKE SURE YOUR HIPS ARE STACKED AND HAVE IT
HIathOhxbIQ_4 0 EXHALE RIBS GO DOWN
HIathOhxbIQ_5 0 STAYING ENGAGED BRING YOUR HANDS IN THE FRONT
HIathOhxbIQ_6 0 NOW WHEN YOU GET UP ON NOT TO THE FRONT YOU GOING LEAD PARALLEL ALONG THE FLOOR TO FORTY FIVE OR MAYBE EVEN NINETY DEGREES DEPENDING ON YOUR LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY THROUGH YOUR HAMSTRING
HIathOhxbIQ_7 0 IT'S A QUICK MOVEMENT OUT SLIGHTLY SLOWER TO A CLOSE KEEPING YOUR LEGS LONG YOU MOVING FROM THE HIP
HIathOhxbIQ_8 0 SO THE BOTTOM LIKE TO THE FRONT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS
HIathOhxbIQ_9 0 OUT AND PRESS OUT AND PRESS
HIathOhxbIQ_10 0 NOW WHEN EVER YOU MISS ANYTHING IN A QUICK FASHION YOU'RE GOING TO BE WIGGLING THROUGH THE CENTER SHOULD BE NO WIGGLING THOUGH IF YOU ENGAGE PROPERLY
HIathOhxbIQ_11 0 YOU SQUEEZING THROUGH THE FRONT SQUEEZING TO THE BACK HAND IS IN FRONT OF YOU FOR SUPPORT
HIathOhxbIQ_12 0 STRETCH IT UP CLOSE IT BACK
HIathOhxbIQ_13 0 STRETCH IT FORWARD AND CLOSE IT BACK KEEPING THE HIPS STACK DON'T ROLL STAY ENGAGED AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE BREATHING
HIathOhxbIQ_14 0 AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO ABOUT MOCK TO THE FRONT LINE ON YOUR SIDE
gftjEctPuKY_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO DO THE SECOND SIDE OF THAT VARIATION ON TWISTING CROW POSE
gftjEctPuKY_2 0 SO A FREE OF THE RIGHT LEG
gftjEctPuKY_3 0 BRING YOUR HEEL UNDERNEATH THE HIP CROSS THE LEFT LEG OVER SO WE'RE READY FOR THE OTHER SIDE
gftjEctPuKY_4 0 AGAIN PLACING THE FINGERS WIDE HANDS TO THE FLOOR AND YOUR LEFT KNEE ON THE UPPER TRICEP BACK SIDE OF THE ARM OF THE RIGHT ARM
gftjEctPuKY_5 0 I'M GOING TO LIFT THE HIPS BY TURNING ABOUT TOES UNDER AND ON BALANCING ON THE FEET MOSTLY SO I'M GOING TO SHIFT THE WEIGHT INTO THE ARMS AS THEY DO SO KEEP THE BEND THE ELBOWS HUG THE CENTER LINE PRESS THROUGH THE FINGERS LIFT THE SHOULDERS AWAY FROM THE FLOOR AND THEN TURN
gftjEctPuKY_6 0 YOU CAN STAY HERE OR EXTEND THE LEGS
gftjEctPuKY_7 0 AND AND AND THEN COME BACK
gftjEctPuKY_8 0 SIT BACK ON THE INHALE IN AND TAKE A FEW DEEP BREATHS
hgGySE80h88_1 0 NOW ONE OF THE THINGS I JUST WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING JUST AND IN GENERAL LOG COLLECTING AND WE'RE TALKING RIGHT NOW SPECIFICALLY ABOUT COLLECTING THE GLASS
hgGySE80h88_2 0 ON A LOT OF THESE THESE THINGS GET BECOME POPULAR FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS AND I CAN GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES
hgGySE80h88_3 0 I MEAN EVERYONE KNOWS MARTHA STEWART MARTHA STEWART WHEN SHE HAD OR SHOSH WILL GO ON AND SHE WILL SHOW YOU SOME OF THE THINGS THAT SHE LIKES A LOT BETTER IN TEA
hgGySE80h88_4 0 ONE OF THE THINGS IN PARTICULAR COMES TO MIND WITH ME IS YELLOW WEAR AND SHE'LL DISPLAY IT IN BACK OF HER WHEN SHE'S TALKING ON ARE SHOWING DOING ANY COOKING
hgGySE80h88_5 0 AND YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF YELLOW WHERE IT BECOMES FAMILIAR TO PEOPLE OF PEOPLE WANT TO COLLECT IT ON THE MARKET STEWART COLLECTS IT THEN IT MUST BE GOOD
hgGySE80h88_6 0 SO ANOTHER THING THAT COMES TO MINE IS A FIRE KING WHICH IS A GREEN DINNERWARE PRODUCED IN THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS THAT I LIKE THIS TO IT SHOWS ALL THE TIME
hgGySE80h88_7 0 AND YOU CAN SEE SHE SHE ACTUALLY REPRODUCED THIS FIRE KING AND BECAME VERY POPULAR SO IT RAISES THE PRICE ON THESE ITEMS WHEN WHEN THEY BECOME MORE IN DEMAND
hgGySE80h88_8 0 SO SOMETHING TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT COLLECTION IF YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND WHERE YOU WANT TO COLLECT I CAN TELL YOU JUST FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE JUST SEEING NOW THAT ON TRANSFER WHERE BROWN TRANSFER WHERE IS VERY ON COLLECTIBLE RIGHT NOW AND IT'S COMMANDING VERY HIGH PRICES
hgGySE80h88_9 0 AND THAT'S BECAUSE MY SISTER WERE MADE POPULAR SHE SHOWS ON A LOT OF OR MAGAZINES YOU SEE NOW MAGAZINES AND TWENTY YEARS AGO IN MY EXPERIENCE BROWN TRANSFER WHERE I HAD IN MY SHOP I COULDN'T SELL IT
hgGySE80h88_10 0 SO YOU CAN SEE THAT JUST A TIME FRAME WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN WHAT YOU COLLECT AND HOW MUCH YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR
hgGySE80h88_11 0 SOMETHING TO CONSIDER SO YOU CAN LOOK IT ALL THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF ON WHERE THESE THESE TYPES OF ON COLLECTIBLES ARE SHOWN AND YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THEM ARE MORE POPULAR NOW THAN OTHERS
hgGySE80h88_12 0 AND THOSE PIECES THAT ARE MORE POPULAR AT THIS TIME PERIOD ARE GOING TO COST MORE MONEY SO THAT'S A CONSIDERATION WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT COLLECTING SOMETHING IN THE END
hgGySE80h88_13 0 ALSO TO CONSIDER HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE AVAILABLE ACCESSIBLE TO GO OUT THERE AND COLLECT SO JUST SOME GENERAL THINGS ABOUT COLLECTING IN RUBY GLASS FALLS INTO THAT SAME CAT
hgGySE80h88_14 0 WE'RE GOING TO HEAD IT'S POPULARITY IN THE LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS EARLY NINETEEN NINETEEN TWENTIES AND PEOPLE LOVE TO COLLECT RUBY ON WHETHER THIS I FEEL HAS A LOT MORE ROOM IN VALUE OF SO YOU'RE PAINTING ON A FAIRLY REASONABLE PRICE AND DOWN THE ROAD HOPEFULLY YOUR VALUING THREE
hgGySE80h88_15 0 SO SOMETHING TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT COLLECTING ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS MOVING

gREt_t5ACe8_1 0 MAYBE YOU'RE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE AN INSTRUMENT OLDER THAN NINETEEN THIRTIES THIS ONE HAPPENS TO BE A BAT EIGHTEEN THIRTY
gREt_t5ACe8_2 0 THERE IS NO PRESS ROD IN THE INSTRUMENT OVER THE NINETEEN THIRTY TO RELATIVELY MODERN INVENTION
gREt_t5ACe8_3 0 BUT I BROUGHT THIS ONE PRIMARILY SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THE ISSUE OF A WAR
gREt_t5ACe8_4 0 WE'LL TALK ABOUT A BULK ELBOW GOES THIS WAY BUT A WARP IS SOMETHING THAT GOES THIS WAY
gREt_t5ACe8_5 0 IF YOU FROM THE C LOOKING AT THIS INSTRUMENT FROM THE END OF THAT THERE IS A PRETTY NASTY TWIST IN THIS NECK
gREt_t5ACe8_6 0 MUCH MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO DO GOES BEYOND THE SCOPE OF A SET UP IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THAT KIND OF AN ISSUE
gREt_t5ACe8_7 0 BASICALLY WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IN THAT CASE LIKE THIS AND THIS IS NOT A JOB FOR THE HOME AMATEUR TO DO WOULD BE TO REMOVE ALL THE FRETS SAND THE FRETBOARD LEVEL PUT THE FRETS BACK IN
G6sHYJym78c_1 0 FIRST LET'S PARTICULAR BOAT HAS A LITTLE FLIP UP HERE

GINnMzLQ5Sc_3 0 AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE OF MY FAVORITE TULIPS IN MY YARD CALLED GREENLAND
GINnMzLQ5Sc_4 0 SO GREENLAND IS SOMETIMES SPELLED G ARE OH BE AN L AND THE FOR ACCRUING ONTO THE DELTS PRONUNCIATION
GINnMzLQ5Sc_5 0 SO IN SOME CATALOGS YOU'LL FIND IT'S BUILD THAT THAT'S WAY
GINnMzLQ5Sc_6 0 BUT IN AMERICA WE CALL A GREEN LAND
GINnMzLQ5Sc_7 0 AND IT'S EASY TO IDENTIFY BECAUSE IT'S SEWING USUAL
GINnMzLQ5Sc_8 0 IT HAS A GREEN STRIPE WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CREAM AND THEN PINK EDGES
GINnMzLQ5Sc_9 0 AND WE CALL IT THE WATERMELON TO LOOK BECAUSE IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A WATERMELON
GINnMzLQ5Sc_10 0 AND WHEN IT'S BRIGHT SUNNY DAY A LOT OF TIMES IT WILL EVEN APPEAR TO BE DARKER PEAK
GINnMzLQ5Sc_11 0 AND BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF SUN THIS YEAR IN THE SPRING IS SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE SOFTER PINK
GINnMzLQ5Sc_12 0 DOESN'T YOURS PASS IS GOING TO MUCH DARKER PINK
GINnMzLQ5Sc_13 0 IT'S A LITTLE BIT TALLER DAFFODIL THAN A LOT OF MY OTHERS
GINnMzLQ5Sc_14 0 AND IT'S JUST A BEAUTIFUL LONG LASTING DAFFODIL THAT NOTE TO LOOK THE SAME
GINnMzLQ5Sc_15 0 AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE SOMEONE JUST PAINTED THE GREEN STRIPES ON IT
GINnMzLQ5Sc_16 0 TO COLORED FLOWERS ARE REALLY POPULAR THESE DAYS AND THIS IS EVEN A BETTER BONUS
GINnMzLQ5Sc_17 0 YOU HAVE THREE COLORS BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT GREEN CREAM AND PINK
GINnMzLQ5Sc_18 0 TAKE THE THE HIGHLIGHTED YOUR YARD IF YOU HAD IT
GINnMzLQ5Sc_19 0 NEXT WE'LL TALK ABOUT ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL TULIP BURGUNDY LACE
G-BbQihTk5k_1 0 SO THE LAST THING THAT YOU WANT TO DO A WHATEVER FINISHING A MAKEUP APPLICATION IS YOU WANT TO CLEAN YOUR BRUSHES
G-BbQihTk5k_2 0 IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR BRUSHES BECAUSE THEY LAST LONGER AND BRUSHES CAN BE A BIG INVESTMENT SO YOU WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THEM FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE
G-BbQihTk5k_3 0 SO WHAT YOU'LL NEED TO GET IS A BRUSH CLEANSER AND A PAPER TOWEL AND YOU CAN BUY BRUSH CLEANSER WITH ALMOST ANY MAKEUP GROUND
G-BbQihTk5k_4 0 AND JUST TAKE THE BRUSH CLEANSER AND SPRAY IT ONTO THE PAPER TOWEL AND THEN YOU TAKE YOUR BRUSH AND WIPE IT BACK AND FORTH UNTIL IT REMOVES ALL THE COLOR
G-BbQihTk5k_5 0 AND THEN IT'S A GOOD IDEA ALSO ABOUT ONCE A MONTH TO SHAMPOO AND CONDITION YOUR BRUSHES
G-BbQihTk5k_6 0 YOU WANT TO USE WARM WATER AND A LITTLE TINY BIT OF SHAMPOO AND THEN RINSE THAT OUT AND THEN USE A LITTLE TINY BIT OF CONDITIONER AND THEN RINSE IT AND AFTER YOU RINSE IT DRY IT FLAT
G-BbQihTk5k_7 0 YOU WANT TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR BRUSHES LIKE YOU TAKE CARE OF YOUR HAIR AND THE LAST A LOT LONGER
G-BbQihTk5k_8 0 SO THAT IS HOW YOU CONDITION YOUR BRUSHES
GnVjTbHu21Q_1 0 IN THAT HOLE OR HORIZONTAL ABDUCTION IS GOOD FOR WORKING THAT INTO THAT V SHAPE A BIG MUSCLE THAT STANDS OUT THROUGH THE BACK ATTACHES AROUND INTO THE FRONT OF THE SHOULDER
GnVjTbHu21Q_2 0 YOU WANT TO LINE UP YOUR WRIST ELBOW AND SHOULDER SO YOU DON'T NEED TO REALLY COME OUT HERE WIDE BECAUSE JOINTS ARE GOING TO DICTATE THAT THAT MUSCLE THEN SHUTS OFF
GnVjTbHu21Q_3 0 SO IF YOU LINE UP YOUR JOINTS ARE GOING TO GET FULL ENGAGEMENT THEIR EQUIPMENT OF THE LATS
GnVjTbHu21Q_4 0 COME DOWN HERE WITH YOUR KNEES IN LINE WITH THE HIPS FEET HIP WIDTH APART AND YOU WANT TO THINK OF BRINGING YOUR SHOULDER BLADES TOGETHER IN A SLIGHT LIFTING THE CHEST BEFORE YOU EVEN INITIATE THE MOVEMENT
GnVjTbHu21Q_5 0 AND BIG INHALE EXHALE AND JUST PULLING THE BAR DOWN BOOM RIGHT THERE IS A GOOD STOPPING POINT
GnVjTbHu21Q_6 0 ANY FURTHER THAN THAT I'M NOT REALLY USING LATS AND YOU'RE LETTING THE LOWER BACK COME INTO PLAY AND RELEASE
GnVjTbHu21Q_7 0 SO INHALE AND CONTRACT DOWN AND JUST TO THAT CHEST BONE AND RELEASE WITH A SLIGHT BEND IN THE ELBOW
GnVjTbHu21Q_8 0 SO YOU'RE KEEPING THAT MUSCLE ON A CONSTANT CONTRACTION BY KEEPING A SLIGHT BEND IN THE ELBOW AND BRINGING IT AND JUST TO THE CHEST AND NO LOWER BECAUSE AFTER THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SHUT THE LATS OFF
GnVjTbHu21Q_9 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU WORK IN A GOOD TEN TO FIFTEEN REPS RANGE ONE TO THREE SETS
HHwBA2f1lGs_1 0 IT'S IMPORTANT JUST LIKE IT WAS WITH THE PAPIER-MACHE TO LET OUR LIZARD DRY
HHwBA2f1lGs_2 0 BUT THE PAINT DRY AND THE GLUE DRY
HHwBA2f1lGs_3 0 SINCE WE USED A COUPLE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAINT
HHwBA2f1lGs_4 0 WE HAVE THE ACRYLIC WHICH DRIES PRETTY QUICKLY ON AND THEN THE TEMPERATE GLITTER WHICH TAKES A LITTLE BIT LONGER SO I THINK IT'S BEST TO LEAVE IT IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA PROBABLY THE SAME PLACE WHERE YOU LEFT IT TO DO ON THE PAPIER-MACHE DRYING PROCESS
HHwBA2f1lGs_5 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HE IS ON A SURFACE THAT CAN BE PULLED UP EASILY
HHwBA2f1lGs_6 0 IF YOU PUT IN MY NEWSPAPER TO DRIVE WITH THIS KIND OF PAINT WITH THE ACRYLIC PAINT WHEN YOU LIFT THEM UP HE'S GOING TO HAVE PIECES THAT NEWSPAPER STEPS TO HIM AND IT'S IT'S ONLY GOING TO CREATE MORE OF A PROCESS FOR GOING BACK AND CLEANING UP THE PAINTING A PAINTING OVER
HHwBA2f1lGs_7 0 IF YOU NEED TO DO A COUPLE OF COATS OF PAINT ON YOUR LIZARD YOU CAN DO THAT LET IT DRY COME BACK IN AND PAINTED OVER AGAIN
HHwBA2f1lGs_8 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU'VE APPLIED A FACE ON YOUR LIZARD THAT THE GLUE IS DRY BEFORE HANGING HAMMER OR DISPLAYING HAND ON THOSE SEQUENCE AND THE AND THE GOOGLEY EYES CAN TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO DRY
gYTm2ca7huo_1 0 ANOTHER GOOD WAY TO ACHIEVE A DRIPPING LIKE EFFECT WITH GLAZE IS TO PUT IT IN A CATCH FOR MASTER BOTTLE
gYTm2ca7huo_2 0 I'VE GOT SOME THAT'S ALREADY PREPARED
gYTm2ca7huo_3 0 SHAKE IT UP MAKE SURE IT'S MIXED REALLY WELL
gYTm2ca7huo_4 0 THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME STUFF THAT COMES OUT OF THE BUCKETS
gYTm2ca7huo_5 0 I JUST MADE SURE TO MIX THEM UP AND PUT IT IN A BOTTLE
gYTm2ca7huo_6 0 THIS IS ONE THAT I FREQUENTLY USE TO DRIP WITH
gYTm2ca7huo_7 0 I JUST SQUEEZE OUT A LITTLE BIT TO MAKE SURE THAT HAVE A CLOGGING THE TIP OF MY BOTTLE
gYTm2ca7huo_8 0 NOW I'VE GOT ON THE SAME BANDING WILL THAT I WAS USING ONE OUNCE WAXING
gYTm2ca7huo_9 0 AND I LIKE TO HAVE A DRIP IT KIND OF VARIES ALL THE WAY AROUND
gYTm2ca7huo_10 0 SO I'M GOING TO JUST GENTLY SQUEEZE OVER AND OVER AS I SPIN THIS PAINTING WHEEL
gYTm2ca7huo_11 0 NOW I'M JUST I'M MAKING LITTLE PUMPS
gYTm2ca7huo_12 0 YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IT COME AROUND IN A SECOND MAKING LITTLE PUMPS WITH MY HAND SO THAT I'M GETTING A REALLY VARIED DRIP LINE
gYTm2ca7huo_13 0 AND THEN I ACTUALLY LIKE TO INTENSIFY THAT DRIP SO WHAT I DO IS I TAKE THE WHOLE POT AND I HIT IT JUST A LITTLE BIT
gYTm2ca7huo_14 0 SOME OF IT'LL DRIP OFF A LITTLE ELONGATE THOSE DRIPS AND MAKE THEM JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE DRAMATIC IN THE END
Gc0p6pmb6oM_1 0 GENERALLY SPEAKING THE EAR IS GOING TO HAVE A SHAPE AS WE'VE LOOKED AT THE OTHER THING THAT IS GENERALLY HALF A CIRCLE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_2 0 IT'S SMOOTH HERE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_3 0 THE LEVEL WITH THE FRONT OF THE FACE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_4 0 IT STICKS OUT TOWARDS THE BACK
Gc0p6pmb6oM_5 0 THE BASIC SHAPE OF THE EAR IS PRETTY SIMPLE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_6 0 IT'S NOT SOMETHING TO BE AFRAID OF
Gc0p6pmb6oM_7 0 EXCUSE THE MULTIPLE DRAWINGS
Gc0p6pmb6oM_8 0 THERE'S A LITTLE LIP HERE THAT LITTLE FROM LITTLE PARK
Gc0p6pmb6oM_9 0 THEN THIS IS A BIG SWIRL AND IN THAT SWIRL THERE'S TYPICALLY A SECOND AREA THAT'S KIND OF A SWIRL
Gc0p6pmb6oM_10 0 IT'S GOT A SHAPE LIKE THAT
Gc0p6pmb6oM_11 0 AND THEN THIS IS THE ACTUAL AREA THAT IS THE DEEPEST WHICH IS WHERE SOUND GOES IN
Gc0p6pmb6oM_12 0 THAT'S THE BASIC SHAPE OF A OF A COMMON HERE AND IF YOU JUST GENERALLY PUT THAT IN THERE MOST PEOPLE WILL ACCEPT THAT IN THE SCULPTURE AS SOMETHING THAT'S SOME BELIEVABLE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_13 0 NOW I'M GOING TO SWITCH TO MY OTHER MODEL CUT BECAUSE THAT REFINED THIS HERE A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND YOU CAN SEE THE BASIC SHAPE COMPARED TO THAT THIS WHICH HAS BEEN SHAPED YET BUT IT FOLLOWS THE SAME BASIC PATTERN
Gc0p6pmb6oM_14 0 WITH THE OUTER LIP BACK HERE THE INNER LIP HERE AND THIS LITTLE AREA HERE AND THE DEEP AREA INSIDE WHICH IS RIGHT IN THERE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_15 0 NOW BECAUSE THIS HAS TO BE CAST I'M NOT GOING TO CARVE THIS DEEP BECAUSE THAT WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS WHEN I HOLD IT SO I'M JUST GOING TO REPRESENT IT WITH THIS WITH THIS SIMPLE APPROACH
Gc0p6pmb6oM_16 0 JUST LIKE IT IS JUST THIS THE SUGGESTION OF THIS AND THIS OUTER LIP REPRESENTING THE ENTIRE SHAPE OF THE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_17 0 THAT THEY'RE THE SAME WAY THAT EVERYTHING ELSE

_Gfw1oLtz04_7 0 YOU WANT TO ASK THEM WHAT SCHOOLS THEY WENT TO
_Gfw1oLtz04_8 0 YOU WANT TO SEE IF THEY HAVE A BEND IN SHOREWARD IF THEY HAVE ANY OTHER QUALIFICATIONS OTHER THAN A HOME COURSE FOR DOG MASSAGE

gQmJ3HwA718_2 0 OKAY SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD A LITTLE EXTRA FLAVOR TO OUR SOUP
gQmJ3HwA718_3 0 THIS IS OUR TOMATOES
gQmJ3HwA718_4 0 NOW THIS IS A FOURTEEN OUNCE CAN OF TOMATOES IN ITS JUICE
gQmJ3HwA718_5 0 WHEN YOU CAN DEFINITELY USE OF FRESH TOMATOES
gQmJ3HwA718_6 0 I FIND THE ADDED JUICE TO THIS ADDS A LOT OF FLAVOR TO IT SO I WOULD ALMOST AND IT IS YOUR OWN TOMATOES IT ALMOST ADD A LITTLE KIND OF TOMATO SAUCE TO A LITTLE MORE IT'S INTO IT OFF OF IT
gQmJ3HwA718_7 0 JUST GO AHEAD AND OPEN THE HOOD
gQmJ3HwA718_8 0 AGAIN I'M JUST KIND OF OLD TIME YOUR PRINTER
gQmJ3HwA718_9 0 AND AS YOU CAN SEE OUR SOUP HAS COME TO A REALLY ROLLING BOIL
gQmJ3HwA718_10 0 WE PROBABLY WANT TO TURN OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BUT YOU WANT TO KEEP IT BOILING THIS COOKED THROUGH THIS CARROTS AND POTATOES
gQmJ3HwA718_11 0 THE MEATBALLS THAT HAVE THE RICE AND WE'RE GOING TO JUST GO AHEAD AND ADD OUR TOMATOES
gQmJ3HwA718_12 0 IN BETWEEN THESE THESE ARE TINY BIT SALTY AND AS WELL AS THE CHICKEN BROTH SO THAT'S WHY WE THAT IT'S A LITTLE SALT IN THE BEGINNING IN OUR SEASONING MIX BECAUSE YOU CAN ALWAYS READJUST YOUR SEASONING WHEN YOU'RE SOUP IS DONE AND YOU CAN ADD THAT YOU REMEMBER YOU CAN TAKE AWAY
gQmJ3HwA718_13 0 ONCE IT'S TOO SALTY IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO REPAIR IT
gQmJ3HwA718_14 0 SO ANYWAY THAT'S THIS STEP
gyNzeQ4nwwg_1 0 REVERSED CURLS WORK THE LOWER HALF OF YOUR RECTUS AND ON THE STOVE FROM NAVAL DOWN TO THE PUBIC BONE AND BACK
gyNzeQ4nwwg_2 0 SO IT'S KIND OF THAT LITTLE PEACHY AREA THAT TENDS TO LOSE A LOT OF ELECTRICITY THAT YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS ON
gyNzeQ4nwwg_3 0 IT'S ALL ONE MUSCLE THAT WORKS TOGETHER BUT YOU CAN PUT A FOCUS ON JUST THAT LOWER HALF
gyNzeQ4nwwg_4 0 SO ROLL DOWN ONE VERTEBRAE AT A TIME
gyNzeQ4nwwg_5 0 TAKE A MOMENT TO JUST LET YOUR SPINE GET USED TO THE SURFACE THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON SO YOU GOT NICE NEUTRAL PELVIC POSTURE SOFT NECK SHOULDER BLADES ARE NICE AND STILL AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR FEET UP IN THE AIR
gyNzeQ4nwwg_6 0 NOW IF YOU NEED TO MAINTAIN THIS NINETY HERE AS LONG AS THE HIP FLEXORS OUT OF THE PICTURE BUT IF YOU CAN EXTEND WE'RE GOING TO CROSS ONE FOOT OVER THE OTHER
gyNzeQ4nwwg_7 0 NOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO THINK OF BRINGING THE KNEES TOGETHER BECAUSE WE WANT TO KEEP A NICE SPACE BETWEEN THE HIPS AND THE PELVIS AND THEN WE'RE JUST GOING TO THINK OF CURLING PUBIC TO ENABLE AND RELEASE
gyNzeQ4nwwg_8 0 IT'S A SMALL MOVEMENT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE A LOT OF MOMENTUM GOING ON HERE
gyNzeQ4nwwg_9 0 CRUNCH AND EXHALE AS YOU CONTRACT INHALE BACK DOWN SO YOU CAN GET FRESH OXYGEN WORKING BACK INTO THE MUSCLE BEFORE YOU TRY TO CONTRACT AGAIN AND EXHALE
gyNzeQ4nwwg_10 0 PUSH LIKE YOU'RE PUSHING THAT CEILING AWAY FROM YOU AND RELEASE
gyNzeQ4nwwg_11 0 AGAIN YOU'RE TRYING TO PULL EVERYTHING TOGETHER NOT IT'S NOT HOW FAR WE COME OVER BECAUSE THEN I'M WORKING WITH MY BACK MORE THAN I AM FOCUSING RIGHT HERE
gyNzeQ4nwwg_12 0 SO IF I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON JUST SET AREA BETWEEN THE PUBIC BONE ENABLE I GOT TO KEEP IT SMALL AND CONTROLLED
gyNzeQ4nwwg_13 0 TRY WORKING UP TO ABOUT TEN REPS WITH RIGHT FOOT OVER LEFT AND THEN STRETCH IN BETWEEN IF YOU NEED TO AND CROSS LEFT OVER RIGHT AND CURL CRUNCH BREATH INHALE DOWN
gyNzeQ4nwwg_14 0 YOU REALLY SHIN SEE A LOT OF MOVEMENT
gyNzeQ4nwwg_15 0 YOU SEE MOVEMENT AS A RESULT OF CONTRACTION IN THAT SMALL AREA THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FOCUS ON
hHrMg9FUMJA_1 0 NOW I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE YOU TO FINGER SPINNING WITH TWO RINGS TO GET THIS TYPE OF EFFECT
hHrMg9FUMJA_2 0 IT'S VERY VISUAL VERY COOL VERY INTERESTING AND SURPRISINGLY NOT THAT HARD THOUGH IT TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO
hHrMg9FUMJA_3 0 YOU WANT TO GRIP THE RINGS SO THAT THE FINGER YOU'RE SPINNING ON IN MY CASE IT'S THE MIDDLE FINGER IS ALREADY IN POSITION TO ACCEPT THE RINGS
hHrMg9FUMJA_4 0 ALL THE OTHER FINGERS ARE BASICALLY USED AS FALL FROM POINTS FOR PUSHING THE RING OUT AND FORWARD
hHrMg9FUMJA_5 0 IT TAKES A GOOD AMOUNT OF FORCE TO RELEASE THE RINGS PROPERLY AND AS YOU CAN SEE I HAVE THEM SPLIT SO THAT AS THEY TAKE OFF THEY NATURALLY SPLIT THE OPPOSITE TIMES
hHrMg9FUMJA_6 0 NOW YOU CAN IF YOU'RE LUCKY JUST START FLAT AND GET IT THERE BUT TO GO STRAIGHT INTO IT YOU WANT TO HAVE THAT SPLIT AS YOU'RE STARTING
hHrMg9FUMJA_7 0 NOW AS YOU EVENTUALLY GET GOOD ENOUGH TO HOLD THIS FOR A LONG WHILE YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY MANIPULATING IT IN CERTAIN WAYS
hHrMg9FUMJA_8 0 FOR INSTANCE I LIKE THAT
hHrMg9FUMJA_9 0 NOW ALL I'M DOING IS ESSENTIALLY AIMING KEEP MY FINGER STRAIGHT AS I DIP IT UNDER MY ARM PIT OUT AROUND STRAIGHT MY ARM AND COME BACK OVER
hHrMg9FUMJA_10 0 THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS TO STOP
hHrMg9FUMJA_11 0 WHEN YOU'RE FIRST LEARNING IT'S GOOD MAYBE JUST HIT YOUR LEGS SO THAT THE STOP THAT WAY AND YOU KIND OF BUT YOU CAN ALSO EVENTUALLY LEARN TO CATCH THEM PROPERLY

_hh0ibfvvuU_19 0 YOU PUT A CYCLING IN THERE
_hh0ibfvvuU_20 0 WHETHER IT'S A SUN PLANT OR SHADE PLANT IS GOING TO DO WELL IN THE NORTHWEST
_hh0ibfvvuU_21 0 SO I'VE GOT MY SECOND LAYER LASAGNA AND I'M GOING TO COVER ALL THAT I LIKE IT

guv2h74Gpyk_1 0 HI I'M CHEF OF THE TWO WHEELER DEALER
guv2h74Gpyk_2 0 TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO CHANGE A FLAT TIRE
guv2h74Gpyk_3 0 THERE'S ONLY ABOUT ONE TOOL THAT YOU NEED TO CHANGE A FLAT TIRE
guv2h74Gpyk_4 0 AND THAT'S JUST A TIRE LEVER
guv2h74Gpyk_5 0 WHEN YOU NEED AT LEAST ONE UP TO ABOUT THREE
guv2h74Gpyk_6 0 DEPENDING ON HOW TIGHT WITH A TIGHT THE TIRE IS
guv2h74Gpyk_7 0 USUALLY YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH USING JUST JUST ONE
guv2h74Gpyk_8 0 FIRST THING IS YOU WANT TO START OPPOSITE THE VALVE STEM
guv2h74Gpyk_9 0 INSERT THE TIRE LEVER UNDER ONE HALF OF THE TIRE BEAD
guv2h74Gpyk_10 0 AND SHOULD THEN BE ABLE TO JUST SLOWLY PRY IT OFF
guv2h74Gpyk_11 0 KIND OF UNZ IT ALL THE WAY AROUND THE ENDING BACK OFFICES THE VALVE STEM
guv2h74Gpyk_12 0 AT THAT POINT SHOULD BE ABLE TO REACH INSIDE THAT TIRE AND REMOVE THE FLAT IN OR TWO
guv2h74Gpyk_13 0 THIS AND THEN YOU CAN GRAB A NEW INNER TUBE OR EITHER TRY AND PATCH THE FLAT ONE
guv2h74Gpyk_14 0 BUT THE NEXT STEP TO REINSTALLING IS GOING TO BE TO INFLATE THE TWO WITH A LITTLE BIT OF AIR JUST TO GIVE IT SOME SHAPE
guv2h74Gpyk_15 0 AND THEN YOU'LL START OPPOSITE OR AS AS REMOVAL
guv2h74Gpyk_16 0 AND IN STIR INSERT THE STEM AND HOLDING THE RIM
guv2h74Gpyk_17 0 AND THEN TUCK THAT TIRE OR THE INNER TUBE OF INTO THE TIRE ALL THE WAY AROUND
guv2h74Gpyk_18 0 AND THEN STARTING AT THE VALVE BEGINS TO REINSTALL THE OTHER HALF OF THE TIRE BEAT
guv2h74Gpyk_19 0 BEING CAREFUL NOT TO CHANGE THE INNER TUBE BETWEEN THE TIRE AND THE RIM AS YOU WORK TO WORK THE BEAD BACK ON
guv2h74Gpyk_20 0 AND YOU WANT TO END UP OPPOSITE THAT VALVE STEM SO THAT YOU HAVE THE MOST SLACK THE TIRE TO ALLOW YOU TO POP THE LAST LITTLE BIT BACK ON
guv2h74Gpyk_21 0 THE TRICK IS NOT TO USE ANY TOOLS WHEN YOU PRACTICE LAST BIT ON
guv2h74Gpyk_22 0 OTHERWISE YOU RUN A HIGHER RISK OF PINCHING THE INNER TUBE
guv2h74Gpyk_23 0 YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT JUST BY WORKING ON SLOWLY
guv2h74Gpyk_24 0 AND YOU HAVE IT
guv2h74Gpyk_25 0 YOU CAN AND THEN JUST INFLATED TO YOUR RECOMMENDED INFLATION PRESSURE
guv2h74Gpyk_26 0 WHICH SHOULD BE MARKS ON THE OUTSIDE OF A PRETTY MUCH ALL TIRES
guv2h74Gpyk_27 0 THAT'S HOW
g6vQ_WYVSk0_1 0 OKAY TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT KEEPING YOUR GOATS HEALTHY IN REFERENCE TO INTESTINAL PARASITES
g6vQ_WYVSk0_2 0 NOW IT'S NOT REAL PLEASANT TOPIC BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE IF YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP COATS
g6vQ_WYVSk0_3 0 GOATS DO GET WORMS
g6vQ_WYVSk0_4 0 IN FACT THEY ALL HAVE THEM
g6vQ_WYVSk0_5 0 IT'S NOT A MATTER OF ELIMINATING WORMS SO MUCH AS IT IS TO MANAGE THE LOAD
g6vQ_WYVSk0_6 0 SOME PEOPLE DO THEIR OWN HOME FECAL TESTS WITH A MICROSCOPE AND EXAMINE THE FECES FOR WORM LARVA TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH SHOVE HIM HOW MUCH LOAD THEY HAVE
g6vQ_WYVSk0_7 0 HOWEVER IF YOU'RE AROUND YOUR GO TEN IF YOU WATCH THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS YOU CAN GENERALLY TELL
g6vQ_WYVSk0_8 0 SOME OF THE SIGNS OF A PARASITES ARE THAT THEY GET A WHITENING OF THE GUM SEND THE WHITES OF THE EYES AND THEY START TO LOOK AT ME MAKE CAN THEY MIGHT ACT SICK
g6vQ_WYVSk0_9 0 YOU MIGHT SEE DIARRHEA OUR OTHER OR OTHER SIGNS THAT THEY'RE JUST NOT QUITE RIGHT
g6vQ_WYVSk0_10 0 THE MAIN PREVENTION FOR WORMS IS TO ROTATE YOUR PASTURES BECAUSE THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE WORM IS SUCH THAT THE LARVA THEY COME OUT IN THE STOOL
g6vQ_WYVSk0_11 0 THE LARVA HATCH OUT DAY THE EGGS HATCH OUT AND THEY WILL GROW
g6vQ_WYVSk0_12 0 THEY CLIMB UP ONTO THE WEEDS AND GRASS AND THEN THE GOATS THREE INGEST THEM AND END UP GETTING AN INFECTED
g6vQ_WYVSk0_13 0 THERE'S SEVERAL WAYS IF YOU HAVE A SERIOUS WORM PROBLEM THAT YOU CAN TREAT THEM WE ADD THE LEATHER WITH INJECTABLE MEDICINE OR A PASTE THAT'S GIVEN TO THEM OR EARLY
g6vQ_WYVSk0_14 0 AND YOU MIGHT CHOOSE THIS TIME TO DO THAT RIGHT BEFORE THEY GO ON PASTURE OR RIGHT AFTER THE FROST
g6vQ_WYVSk0_15 0 ALSO IF YOU'VE TREATED YOUR WORMS WITH WHERE MEDICINE YOU CAN DRINK THE MILK OR EAT THE MEAT FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DAYS
g6vQ_WYVSk0_16 0 SO IT MIGHT BE WISE TO WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE DRIED OFF OR THE LATE IN PREGNANCY TO DO THE WORMING
hErdpsfFwec_1 0 HI MY NAME IS DAN UPON I'M WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
hErdpsfFwec_2 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO TAKE BASIC SIMPLE BALLOONS AND COMBINING TOGETHER TO CREATE A COMPLEX BLEND
hErdpsfFwec_3 0 IN OUR PREVIOUS SEGMENT WE ARE TO COMBINE A HEART WITH THE TEDDY BEAR
hErdpsfFwec_4 0 WE'RE NOW GOING TO COMBINE A SMALL FLOWER AND A BASIC HAPPY WITH THE HEART AND THE TEDDY BEAR AND PUT THOSE ALL TOGETHER
hErdpsfFwec_5 0 STARTING WITH THE SMALL FLOWER AND INFLATED BLOOM FOR LEAVING QUITE A BIT UNINFLATED SO AS I TWIST THE BALLOON MY BUBBLES I'M PUTTING THE AIR AND THE EMPTY PART OF THE BALLOON TIE THE BALLOON OFF DO AN APPLE TIE BY STICKING MY FINGER INSIDE THE BALLOON AND GRABBING HOLD OF THE APART THAT I PUT IN THERE
hErdpsfFwec_6 0 PULL MY FINGER OUT AND THEN TWIST THE REMAINDER THE BALLOON AND THE APPLE TIE SHOULD STAY LIKE THIS
hErdpsfFwec_7 0 AND THEY CONTINUE ON BY DOING TO APPROXIMATELY ONE INCH BUBBLES
hErdpsfFwec_8 0 ALWAYS HOLDING ON TO THE END OF THE BALLOON SO IT DOESN'T COME APART
hErdpsfFwec_9 0 AND THEN TAKE THOSE TWO TOGETHER FOLDING NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND TWIST AND I'M GOING TO REPEAT THAT STEP TWO MORE TIME
hErdpsfFwec_10 0 THERE IS YOUR BASIC FLOWER
hErdpsfFwec_11 0 I CAN COMBINED THAT BY PUTTING THE FLOWER INSIDE THE TEDDY BEAR FOR NOW I'VE GOT A HEART WITH A TEDDY BEAR HOLDING A SMALL FLOWER
HgfNeFjfdJY_1 0 THAT'S GOING TO BE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT HELMETS FOR SNOWBOARDING
HgfNeFjfdJY_2 0 WHEN GOING SNOWBOARDING YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO ONLY USE A SKIERS SNOWBOARDING HELMET A BIKE HELMET OR A FOOTBALL HELMET ORAL ACROSS HELMET NONE OF THOSE ARE GOING TO WORK
HgfNeFjfdJY_3 0 THESE HELMETS ARE MADE SPECIFICALLY TO BE HELD UP IN THE COLD CONDITIONS
HgfNeFjfdJY_4 0 THEY COME INSULATED
HgfNeFjfdJY_5 0 THEY HAVE A LOT OF ADJUSTABLE SETTINGS ON THEM AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY HAVE COVERINGS OVER THE YEARS THAT ARE ALMOST LIKE EAR WARMERS
HgfNeFjfdJY_6 0 NOW THE EVEN MAKE INTEGRATED HELMETS THAT HAVE HEADPHONES IN THE EAR FLAPS BUT AGAIN YOU DO NOT WANT TO USE ANYTHING ELSE BESIDES SKIING OR SNOWBOARDING HELMET BECAUSE BIKE HELMET YES IT CAN TAKE THE IMPACT IN WARMER TEMPERATURES BUT IF YOU WERE TO BRING A BIKE HELMET OR SOMETHING ELSE TO THE MOUNTAIN WITH IT JUST THE COALS PRETTY MUCH CAN CRACK IT LIKE AN EGG SHELL AS SOON AS YOU WERE TO HIT ANYTHING
HgfNeFjfdJY_7 0 SO AGAIN JUST USE A SKI AND SNOWBOARD ON
GJTeGXfpmUw_1 0 NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS DRAW THE EYES BUT BEFORE WE CAN DRAW THE EYES WE NEED TO DRAW A LINE AND THROUGH THE CENTER AND IT'S A CURVE LIVE BECAUSE IT'S GOING AROUND THE CURVES OBJECT
GJTeGXfpmUw_2 0 THIS IS GOING TO BE USED THE CENTER OF THE EYE ON THAT LEFT DIE
GJTeGXfpmUw_3 0 NOW THE WAY THAT WORKS IT'S SORT OF A SHAPE WITH A TEAR DUCK IT'S GOING TO BE LOWEST PART OTHERWISE GRAVITY WOULDN'T WORK ON IT PROPERLY SO THIS IS THE SHAPE OF AN EYE IN VERY CRUDE SIX
GJTeGXfpmUw_4 0 THE OTHER EYE IS GOING TO BE A MIRROR IMAGE OF THAT PUTS IT FORESHORTENED IT'S NOT GOING TO BE QUITE AS LONG
GJTeGXfpmUw_5 0 THERE'S THE TEAR DUCT AND WE COME AROUND THERE LIKE THIS
GJTeGXfpmUw_6 0 YOU'LL BE RACING THESE GRID LIMES LATER ON
GcIfvcCPE4U_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT CANCER
GcIfvcCPE4U_2 0 CANCER AND PISCES ARE THE MOST THAT THEY'RE NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME BUT THEY THEY CARRY A LOT OF THE SAME CHARACTERISTICS OF IN RELATIONSHIPS
GcIfvcCPE4U_3 0 CANCER CANCER PEOPLE TO CAN ARE COMPATIBLE WITH ALL THEIR SIGNS
GcIfvcCPE4U_4 0 THERE'S SOME SIGNS THAT SAY A LEO WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TOLERATE THE MOVIE NOTES OF A OF A CANCER FOR TOO LONG OR
GcIfvcCPE4U_5 0 CANCERS IF IF THEY FEEL REJECTION OR IF THEY FEEL HURT WE'RE LOCK THEMSELVES AWAY INSIDE THE HOUSE FOR QUITE SOME TIME BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE COMFORTABLE
GcIfvcCPE4U_6 0 THINK ABOUT THE SHELL ON THE BACK OF THE CRAB
GcIfvcCPE4U_7 0 THAT DRAWS A LEO PERSON CRAZY BECAUSE LEOS ARE JUST A OUT THERE
GcIfvcCPE4U_8 0 THEY'RE THEY'RE GREGARIOUS
GcIfvcCPE4U_9 0 THEY'RE THERE
GcIfvcCPE4U_10 0 THEY'RE THE SAW THE PROBLEM
GcIfvcCPE4U_11 0 THEY DON'T LINGER IN THE PAST
GcIfvcCPE4U_12 0 THEY EVEN THOUGH THERE'S THERE'S SOME SENSE OF INSECURITIES THEY DON'T RELY ON THEIR INSECURITIES
GcIfvcCPE4U_13 0 THEY THEY USUALLY DON'T LIKE A BUT THEY DON'T LIKE FOR PEOPLE TO AFFECT THEM AND SO THEY ARE
GcIfvcCPE4U_14 0 THEY THEY CHANGE THAT WITH THEIR THEIR LEADERSHIP SKILLS AND WITH THAT ARE THE BASIC WHEN WE GALLERY
GcIfvcCPE4U_15 0 SO I CANCER AND A LEO CAN WORK WELL BECAUSE IF IF THE LEO PERSON BECOMES MORE COMPASSIONATE TOWARDS THE CANCER AND LEARNS TO PROTECT THOSE TRAITS WITHIN THE CANCER AND KNOWS THAT OF THERE WILL BE A WOULD DRAW
GcIfvcCPE4U_16 0 IF SAY THEY'RE OUT TOGETHER AND SOMEONE INSULTS THE THE CANCER MATE THAT THIS CANCER MATES IT'S GOING TO RETREAT AND THAT'S THAT
GcIfvcCPE4U_17 0 AND SO JUST THAT'S BE EXCEPT THAT SO IF THE LEO CAN EXCEPT THAT PART ABOUT THE CANCER THAT IT'S HARD
GcIfvcCPE4U_18 0 CANCERS ARE VERY SENSITIVE LOVERS
GcIfvcCPE4U_19 0 THEY LOVE THE HOME
GcIfvcCPE4U_20 0 THE WILL HAVE THE THE COVERS THAT ARE SOFT AND AND A THAT FEEL NICE LIKE OF A LOW OR OR YOU KNOW THAT THAT NICE FABRIC
GcIfvcCPE4U_21 0 THAT WILL HAVE THE FLUFFY PILLOWS OR HAVE THEIR FAVORITE PILLOW
GcIfvcCPE4U_22 0 THE HOME IN THE BEDROOM IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM
GcIfvcCPE4U_23 0 AGAIN IT'S A VERY CLOSE THE WARM ENVIRONMENT
GcIfvcCPE4U_24 0 THEY'RE THEY'RE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE SO THERE'S SENSITIVE TOWARDS ANOTHER TWO THERE ARE COMPANIONS EMOTIONS AND TO THEIR NEEDS
GcIfvcCPE4U_25 0 SO THE CANCER WOULD GET ALONG WITH THE LEO BECAUSE THE CANCER WILL TAKE YOU KNOW THEY'RE VERY CARING PEOPLE AND THE CARROTS WILL TAKE CARE OF LEO
GcIfvcCPE4U_26 0 BUT IT'S JUST HAVE A LEO WOULD FEEL ABOUT THE CANCER
GcIfvcCPE4U_27 0 SO IN ACTUALITY LEO JUST NEEDS TO LOOK AT THESE CHARACTERISTICS AND SAY OKAY I NEED TO ACCEPT THAT THAT YOU KNOW I CAN'T CHANGE THAT IN THE CANCER PERSON
GcIfvcCPE4U_28 0 AND JUST ALLOW THE CANCER TO DO WHAT COMES NATURALLY
GcIfvcCPE4U_29 0 TO WANT TO STAY AT HOME MORE TO MAKE THE HUMP IN THE HOME A HOME BASE AND EVERYTHING COMES OUT FROM THE HOME
GcIfvcCPE4U_30 0 BUT A HOME IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE THE THE CANCER AND SO
GcIfvcCPE4U_31 0 THEY ARE THEIR LOVEMAKING TENDS TO SHOW THE OTHER PERSON A LOT MORE CONSIDERATION A LOT MORE CARRYING A LOT MORE COMPASSION A LOT MORE NURTURING
GcIfvcCPE4U_32 0 SINCE THEY'RE SO SENSITIVE THEY USE ALL THEIR SENSES YOU KNOW THE TIME THE HANDS THE EVERYTHING THEY THEY THEY USE ALL ALL FIVE SENSES THEM OF MAKING
GcIfvcCPE4U_33 0 THEY TEND TO GO LONGER BECAUSE THAT IS ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE IN A NICE WARM ENVIRONMENT
GcIfvcCPE4U_34 0 SO IF YOU HAVE IF YOU HAVE A CANCER LOVER I WOULD SUGGEST YOU MAKE IT A NICE HOME ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THE CANCER WILL TEND TO STICK AROUND AND USUALLY HAVE MORE LOVEMAKING BAD
GcIfvcCPE4U_35 0 DON'T EXPECT THE CANCER TO MAKE LOVE WARM ON A ROOF TAUGHT YOU KNOW WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN WATCH BECAUSE IT'S JUST WOULD NOT BE WITHIN A CHARACTERS NATURE
GcIfvcCPE4U_36 0 HOWEVER BE WITHIN THE LEOS NATURE
GRBkx6X7G4Q_1 0 I'M VERY IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER WHEN YOU'RE COLLECTING ARE ORNAMENTS IS THAT THEY DO GET DIRTY
GRBkx6X7G4Q_2 0 THEY HANG ON YOUR TREE FOR TWO MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR THEY GET DUSTY
GRBkx6X7G4Q_3 0 YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ON HOW YOU CLEAN MEANS
GRBkx6X7G4Q_4 0 ON ORNAMENTS LIKE THIS THAT ARE THE CHARACTERS I USUALLY TAKE A BOWL OF SOAPY WATER AND ONE OF CLEAR
GRBkx6X7G4Q_5 0 GET THE CUE TIP IN CLEAN THE AREAS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO THE DUST
GRBkx6X7G4Q_6 0 TOGETHER THE EQ TIP IT RUNS WATER AND RINSE IT OFF AND SET IT SOME PLACE TO DRY
GRBkx6X7G4Q_7 0 MAKE SURE THAT IT'S TOTALLY DRY BEFORE YOU PICK THAT UP WITH THEM UP FOR THE SEASON
GRBkx6X7G4Q_8 0 ON ORNAMENTS LIKE THE ACRYLIC YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER YOU TOUCH THEM IN AT LEAST FINGERPRINTS WHICH MAKES THEM DIRTY
GRBkx6X7G4Q_9 0 FOR THESE I TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF WIND NEXT TO IT AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE TOTALLY DRY AND I'LL WINDEX HAS BEEN REMOVED BEFORE I PACK THEM UP
GRBkx6X7G4Q_10 0 THE ONE THING YOU DO WANT TO REMEMBER WHEN YOU'RE COLLECTING OLDER ORNAMENTS AND YOU HAVE THE GLASS BALLS DO NOT WASH THEM WITH ANYTHING
GRBkx6X7G4Q_11 0 THE OLDER ONES LIKE THIS THEY'RE PAINTED ON AND IT WILL SMEAR THE PAINT IN YOUR ORNAMENT WILL BE RUINED
GRBkx6X7G4Q_12 0 SO THESE GET DIRTY TRY TO BRUSH THEM OFF OF THE DRY CLOTH

hIvoEhIvk0o_3 0 THERE'S A HALF STEP BETWEEN A B C SO TO GET THE C E AND JUST SET YOUR THIRD FINGER DOWN RIGHT NEXT TO THE SECOND FINGER AND THEN TO GET EVEN WHEN YOU WANT THE FIRST FINGER AND D AND JUST LIKE IN THE F AND A THIRD AND KIND OF WANT TO THINK OF YOUR C IS TUNING IT UP TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S IN TUNE WITH THE IN YOUR EASY YOU CAN ALSO TUNE WITH ALL THOSE
hIvoEhIvk0o_4 0 SO THAT'S THE THIRD WITH THE C AND IT'S A GOOD YOU'RE BEGINNING TO PRACTICE FINDING THE SEED IS STILL
gvjqx8Sxfrw_1 0 NOW I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE THE HARMONICS TO FORM SOME CHORDS
gvjqx8Sxfrw_2 0 NOW A HARMONIC AS YOU'LL SEE IN THE NEXT SERIES IS WHEN YOU DON'T LATELY TOUCH YOUR FINGER TO THE STRING BUT NOT TO PRESS IT ENOUGH TO EITHER MUTE THE STRING OR TO FRET THE NOTE
gvjqx8Sxfrw_3 0 NOW YOU'RE GOING TO USE THE CENTER OF YOUR FINGER WHEN YOU USE HARMONICS
gvjqx8Sxfrw_4 0 IF YOU'RE ONLY PLAYING ONE STRING WILL JUST USE THE POINTY PART OF YOUR FINGER PRINT
gvjqx8Sxfrw_5 0 NOW YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THAT OVER THE TWELFTH FRET IS THAT IS PROBABLY THE STRONGEST PLACE TO FIND ON THIS INSTRUMENT UP TO GET HARMONIC STIRRING IT
gvjqx8Sxfrw_6 0 THIS WOULD BE CALLED NATURAL HARMONICS
gvjqx8Sxfrw_7 0 NOW YOU CAN MAKE CHORDS THAT ARE THOSE IF YOU ADD THREE OR MORE HARMONICS TOGETHER THREE OR ANY NOTES TOGETHER WILL FORM A CHORD
gvjqx8Sxfrw_8 0 NOW SINCE THIS UKULELE ISN'T THAT ONE OF THE BEST INSTRUMENTS THAT YOU CAN GET UKULELES THAT ARE ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT HERE IS PROBABLY GOING TO BRING OUT BEST ON THE TWELFTH FRET
gvjqx8Sxfrw_9 0 NOW SINCE THE NOTES INVOLVES ON THE TWELFTH FRET ARE THE SAME AS THE OPEN STRINGS THAT ONLY OCCURS IN BOTH FRET THE OPEN STRINGS MAKE A C SIX CHORD
gvjqx8Sxfrw_10 0 SO ALL OF THE HARMONICS ON THE TWELFTH FRET TOGETHER IT WILL GIVE YOU A HARMONIC VERSION OF A C SIX COOL
g8Ko3oJQfZc_1 0 THERE ARE THREE PRIMARY POINTS FOR TREATING SHOULDER ARTHRITIS
g8Ko3oJQfZc_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE MOST EASY TO FIND
g8Ko3oJQfZc_3 0 NONE OF THE SHOULDER POINTS ARE PARTICULARLY EASY SO YOU MAY END UP JUST DOING MASSAGE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE
g8Ko3oJQfZc_4 0 BUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH IS SHOULDER SEAM AND THAT IS FROM THE SHOULDER LARGE INTESTINE FIFTEEN
g8Ko3oJQfZc_5 0 FIND THE POINTY IS POINT TO THE SHOULDER
g8Ko3oJQfZc_6 0 MOVE DOWN AND A LITTLE BIT BACK AND YOU'RE GOING TO FALL INTO A SPACE BETWEEN THE MUSCLE TENDON AND THE KICK AND THE BOTTOM AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUT STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN PRESSURE IN THAT AREA
g8Ko3oJQfZc_7 0 AGAIN THIS CAN BE REALLY HARD TO FIND ESPECIALLY IN THE REASONABLY MUSCLE DOG COKE WAS GOING TO LIE DOWN FOR THIS PARTICULAR SESSION
g8Ko3oJQfZc_8 0 YOU CAN MASSAGE THE AREA AS WELL
g8Ko3oJQfZc_9 0 IT'S VERY EASY JUST TO RUB THAT WHOLE AREA AND YOU PICK UP THE NEXT TWO POINTS AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT AS WELL
g8Ko3oJQfZc_10 0 YOU CAN FIND THAT PARTICULAR POINT THAT'S A REALLY REALLY GOOD ONE
g8Ko3oJQfZc_11 0 WE SHOULDER INJURY BE QUITE OFTEN HAVE LAME THIS ON ONE LEG
g8Ko3oJQfZc_12 0 THE OTHER LEG BEND GETS WORKS REALLY HARD AND IT TENDS TO BE PAINFUL BECAUSE IT'S DOING THE WORK OF BOTH FRONT LEGS ARE MORE OF THE WORK BOTH FRONT LEGS
g8Ko3oJQfZc_13 0 IN THAT CASE YOU ALSO WANT TO DO THE OTHER SIDE AS WELL SO DO BOTH SHOULDER POINTS
GA_8l1lwMYg_1 0 OKAY NOW ANOTHER STEP THIS AGAIN NOT CRUCIAL THAT THINGS ARE VERY HELPFUL TO ONE INCREASING THE LENGTH OF THE STRING LIFE WHEN YOU PUT A NEW SET OF STRINGS ON ON IS LUBRICATING THE NUT AND LOCKSMITHS OFTEN TIMES THESE GRAPHITE IN NEW LOCKS TO TO MAKE THE KNEE KEYS IN A LOT BETTER
GA_8l1lwMYg_2 0 SO THEY'LL THEY'LL PUT SOME GRAPHITE POWDER AND LOCK IN IT LUBRICATED
GA_8l1lwMYg_3 0 SO WE CAN DO THE SAME THING WITH THE GRAPHITE PENCIL
GA_8l1lwMYg_4 0 AND ALL YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS A GET IN HERE AT THE NUT AND JUST KIND OF RUB AND TWIST OF WITH YOUR YOUR PENCIL IN THERE AND JUST KIND OF YOU'LL YOU'LL BEGIN TO SEE THAT THE GRAPHITE FLAKE OFF AND YOU CAN PUSH IT DOWN INTO THE GROOVE
GA_8l1lwMYg_5 0 AND IF YOU'VE EVER HEARD THE THE HIGH PITCHED A KIND OF CATCHING SOUND THAT GUITARS MAKE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE TUNING THEM IT'S THE STRING ACTUALLY GETTING CAUGHT IN THE NUT AND THEN SLIPPING THROUGH AND THIS CAN A CAUSE A LOT OF WEAR AND TEAR ON THE STRINGS
GA_8l1lwMYg_6 0 AND A LOT OF TIMES STRINGS IN THAT BREAKING RIGHT HERE AT THE NUT AS WELL AS AT THE TUNER AND DOWN AT THE BRIDGE
GA_8l1lwMYg_7 0 AND SO THE ANY WHERE THERE'S A CONTACT POINT OF METAL ON METAL OR EVEN THIS PLASTIC OR BONE THAT THAT COMPRISES THE NET IT'S THAT IT'S A PLACE WHERE THE STRING CAN BREAK
GA_8l1lwMYg_8 0 AND THIS IS JUST ONE PLACE WHERE WE CAN USE THIS GRAPHITE AS A LUBRICANT AND IT'S GOING TO JUST CREATE A SMALL A LAYER IN BETWEEN THE NUT AND THE STRING TO ALLOW THIS STRING DECIDE TO FREE

HforiGOhPEI_8 0 OTHER PEOPLE THE ROW THESE BIKES AND THE THIRTIES FORTIES IN EARLY NINETEEN FIFTIES THEY'RE NOT INTO COLLECTING ANY BIKES RIGHT NOW SO THE VALUE ON THESE HAS DROPPED BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AS MUCH OF A DEMAND
HforiGOhPEI_9 0 ALTHOUGH THEY ARE STILL BEAUTIFUL BIKES JUST FOR THEIR JUST FOR THEIR LOOK
HforiGOhPEI_10 0 OVER HERE THE MIDDLE WEIGHT BIKES THESE ALSO HAVE LIMITED COLLECTED THAT COLLECT ABILITY
HforiGOhPEI_11 0 THEY WERE ONLY MADE THIS STYLE IS MADE FOR MAYBE TEN YEARS
HforiGOhPEI_12 0 THEY CAN HAVE THE JETSTREAM LOOK TO THEM KIND OF SPACE AGE LOOK TO THEM BUT THEY ONLY MADE FROM SAY NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE TONIGHT IN SIXTY FIVE SO THE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION THAT GOT ONE OF THESE FOR CHRISTMAS OR ROLL THEM ON THEIR PAPER ROUTE TO MUCH SMALLER SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION
HforiGOhPEI_13 0 OVER HERE THE MUSCLE BIKES THESE REALLY PEAKED A FEW YEARS AGO AND ARE STARTING TO COME DOWN BECAUSE ONE BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY IN GENERAL BUT TO BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT ROW THESE WHEN THEY TURN SAY FORTY AND THEY GET THEIR KIDS OR TEN YEARS OLD AND NOW THEY START THINKING ABOUT THE BIKE THEY HAD WHEN THEY WERE A KID WELL THEY WANT TO GO AND FIND ONE
HforiGOhPEI_14 0 AND THERE WAS A HUGE RUSH ON THESE CYCLES FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS
HforiGOhPEI_15 0 AND TODAY THIS BIKE IF IT ONE FOR TO WANT TO FIFTY DOLLARS A FEW YEARS AGO THIS BIKE WITH A GONE FOR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THIS CONDITION JUST AS IT SITS
HforiGOhPEI_16 0 IN THE ENGLISH BIKES THESE ARE TIMELESS
HforiGOhPEI_17 0 THEY'RE COLLECTED BY PEOPLE THAT HAVE THEM WHEN THEY WERE GROWING UP AND THEY'RE ALSO COLLECTED BY PEOPLE THAT WANT THEM AS A GOOD RIDABLE COMMUTER BIKE
HforiGOhPEI_18 0 THEY HAVE FENDERS THEY HAVE AN UPRIGHT RIDING POSITION A COMFORTABLE SEAT AND THEY CAN BE SHIFT WHILE THEY'RE STOPPED

gP-a7pUorgo_7 0 THE REASON ALL WIND CAN HAVE BUBBLES IN IT IS OF COURSE THE CARBON DIOXIDE IS A BYPRODUCT OF FERMENTATION
gP-a7pUorgo_8 0 WHEN THE PIECES HITTING THE SUGAR IN MAKING ALCOHOL IT'S ALSO CREATING SEALER TO AND EVEN IF THE CEO TO IS NOT PURPOSELY CAPTURED IN THE CLASS A LITTLE BIT REMAINS IN THE WIND AND WILL REMAIN IN THE BOTTLE AND WILL REMAIN IN YOUR WINE GLASS

gFlUECHB2qo_2 0 DIALOGUE AND A CAPITAL A IS ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OTHER THEN DRAMATIC ACTION
gFlUECHB2qo_3 0 AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS BASICALLY AND OBVIOUSLY THE DIALOGUE FACILITATES THE DRAMATIC ACTION
gFlUECHB2qo_4 0 BUT IS THERE ANY OTHER PURPOSE IN THE DIALOGUE THEN THE DRAMATIC ACTION
gFlUECHB2qo_5 0 NOW THIS IS WHERE WE MIGHT TALK ABOUT THERE ARE CERTAIN COLLOQUIAL LISTENS THERE ARE CERTAIN SLAYING TERMINOLOGY TO FACILITATE THE PLAY OR FACILITATE A CERTAIN FEELING ABOUT THE PLAY
gFlUECHB2qo_6 0 PERHAPS THERE IS A REALLY THEM ON A MELODY A STYLE OF RIDING THAT WHERE THE PLAY RIGHT IS TRYING TO MAKE A STATEMENT WITH A PARTICULAR STYLE WITH A PARTICULAR RHYTHM WITH A PARTICULAR SET OF LANGUAGE OR SLAYING OR WORD CHOICE
gFlUECHB2qo_7 0 THAT'S WHERE YOU YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT
gFlUECHB2qo_8 0 FOR EXAMPLE IN EQUITAS THEIR SELL A LOT OF COLLOQUIAL ISMS THERE'S ALSO A RIBBON ON TO THE RIDING OF THE PLAY

GVoDS2IzVtE_4 0 THE PEELING OF THIS PRODUCT IS JUST AWFUL
GVoDS2IzVtE_5 0 IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT GOES BACK TO THE OLD SCHOOL THOUGHT THOUGH
GVoDS2IzVtE_6 0 THIRTY FORTY YEARS AGO WE WERE ALL TAHT NINE GLARE GLASS IS THE BEST PRODUCT IN THE WORLD FOR YOUR PRODUCT IT SINCE THEN WE HAVE LEARNED OTHERWISE
GVoDS2IzVtE_7 0 AND THAT NINE GLARE IN BITES LIGHT IN WHICH DAMAGE IS YOU WANT IT PLEXIGLASS GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT CLEARED FOR PICTURE THEN THE GLASS NINE GLARE THOUGHT

GVoDS2IzVtE_10 0 BUT I REALLY SUGGEST THAT YOU DO NOT HANG A PICTURE WITH NINE GLARE CLASS OR PLEX SEE IN THE SUNLIGHT IT AREA
GVoDS2IzVtE_11 0 THIS PRODUCT WILL STILL INVITE LIGHT THROUGH INTO YOUR PICTURE WHICH WILL HELP FADE YOUR PICTURE IT HAS NO UV PROPERTIES IN IT
GVoDS2IzVtE_12 0 IT'S JUST A GLAZING THOUGHT FOR YOUR PICTURE
GVoDS2IzVtE_13 0 THERE'S SOME PEOPLE YOU CANNOT CONVENIENCE THE NINE GLARES THE RIGHT THING TO DO NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO
GyUoVVz0nEY_1 0 HERE I HAVE A PAIR OF FLAVOR LEG PANTS THESE ARE DESIGNED IS JEANS BUT THE POINT OF HAVING FLARE LIKE PANTS IS THAT IT MAKES YOUR LEGS WITH THINNER
GyUoVVz0nEY_2 0 THAT'S ONE TRICK TO MINIMIZE THE BIGGER LEGS IS TO HAVE SKINNY ALONG THE LEG AND FLARE AT THE BOTTOM
GyUoVVz0nEY_3 0 IT'LL MAKE IT THE OVERALL LOOK ELONGATED AND OBVIOUSLY WITH THESE KIND OF DRAWINGS THAT'S NOT NECESSARY BUT WITH THE DRAWING LIKE THIS AND WITH THE FASHION MODEL IT JUST SERVE TO REINFORCE THAT WHOLE POINT EVEN MORE SO AND ALMOST LIKE A CARICATURE A PERSON
GyUoVVz0nEY_4 0 WHICH IS WHAT THEY REALLY ARE BUT IF YOU MAKE YOUR DRAWING EXTRA SKINNY AS OPPOSED TO IS THE DRAWING THAT IT JUST DRIVES HELMET YOUR WHOLE IDEA IT TO WHOEVER YOU'RE VIEWER AS TO WHETHER YOU'RE SELLING YOUR COLLECTION TO TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING YOUR COLLECTION

HeiOS5o4TKM_1 0 HI THIS IS DAVID JACKEL ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT STUDYING SONG STRUCTURES
HeiOS5o4TKM_2 0 NOW AS YOU WRITE YOUR OWN SONGS YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR IDEAS AND WAYS TO BUILD THE STRUCTURES OF YOUR SONGS
HeiOS5o4TKM_3 0 THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO DOING THIS
HeiOS5o4TKM_4 0 I THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS YOU CAN DO IS STEADY OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK
HeiOS5o4TKM_5 0 MUCH LIKE PAINTERS IN SCHOOL WELL STUDY THE PAINTING SOME GREAT MASTERS IN AND LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT DETAILS AND DIFFERENT APPROACHES DONE
HeiOS5o4TKM_6 0 YOU WANT TO DO THE SAME THING AS YOU WRITE SONGS
HeiOS5o4TKM_7 0 WHEN YOU HAVE SOME TIME SIT DOWN WITH THE RECORDING OR COUPLE RECORDINGS OF SONGS THAT YOU REALLY LIKE GETTING NOTEBOOK LIKE THIS AND THEN RIGHT DOWN EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE SONG
HeiOS5o4TKM_8 0 START WITH THE INTRO RIGHT DOWN HOW MANY MEASURES IT HAPPENS FOR RIGHT DOWN THE VERSE RIGHT DOWN HOW MANY VERSUS THERE ARE WHEN THE CHORUS COMES IN RIGHT DOWN THE BRIDGE RIGHT ON THE CELL UP
HeiOS5o4TKM_9 0 MAP OUT THE ENTIRE SONG AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT AFTERWARDS AND ASK YOURSELF OKAY WITH THESE PEOPLE DO IT TO MAKE THE SONG SOUND LIKE IT DOES
HeiOS5o4TKM_10 0 ONCE YOU'VE TAKEN A LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLE SONGS THEN YOU CAN GO TO THE NEXT STEP AND THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WEAR THAT SONG WRITER AND HOW YOU WOULD CHANGE THE STRUCTURE
HeiOS5o4TKM_11 0 BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HEAR A SONG THAT YOU REALLY LIKE WITH ANYTHING TO YOURSELF GOT YOU KNOW WHAT IF I CUT I GO BACK AND I MAKE THE SO LOW HALF AS LONG IT'S TOO LONG THE OUTFIELD TAKES TOO LONG OR MAYBE WE WANT OUR CHORUS HERE MAYBE WE NEED TO TRANSITION UMBRAGE HERE
HeiOS5o4TKM_12 0 AND AS YOU START TO STUDY OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK AND LEARN THAT TECHNIQUES THEY USED TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE READY TO START COMING UP WITH YOUR OWN TECHNIQUES AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T LOOK AT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THAT DONE AND YOU'RE REALLY JUST GOING TO BE RESTRICTED TO YOUR INITIAL IDEAS
HeiOS5o4TKM_13 0 SO BY ALL MEANS EXPOSE YOURSELF TO AS MANY DIFFERENT SONGWRITING IDEAS YOU CAN
HeiOS5o4TKM_14 0 ONE LAST THING YOU CAN TRY TO AFTER YOU'VE BEEN STUDYING SOMEONE SONG STRUCTURE IS TO TAKE A SONG THAT YOU'VE WRITTEN RIGHT OUT THE STRUCTURE THE SAME WAY THAT YOU DID THERE IS TAKE A LOOK AT IT IN AND SAY WHAT IF I TRY WHAT THEY DID AND SWITCH YOUR SONG AROUND A LITTLE BIT THAT WAY
HeiOS5o4TKM_15 0 IT'S A NATURAL IT'S NOT WHAT YOU WOULD INSTINCTIVELY DO BUT THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD UPON YOUR IDEAS TO BREAK WITH YOUR INITIAL INSTINCTS AND TRY NEW THINGS

GILCH6UAez4_5 0 ALL SO IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO LAY OUT THE GLIDER AND PREPARE IT FOR ATTACHING INTO THE TRIKE BUGGY
GILCH6UAez4_6 0 THEN TAKE THE WING OUT OF THE STUFF SACK
GILCH6UAez4_7 0 WE WANT TO ORIENT FOR THE WING INTO WHATEVER WIND NO MATTER HOW SMALL WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE WING IS POINTED RIGHT INTO THE WIND
GILCH6UAez4_8 0 IN THIS CASE IT HAPPENS TO BE POINTING RIGHT INTO THE SUN SO IT'S PRETTY EASY TO TELL THAT
GILCH6UAez4_9 0 KEEP THE LINES OUT HERE
GILCH6UAez4_10 0 WE DON'T WANT TO GET ANY THESE LINES THROUGH IT CAUSE OURSELF KNOTS
GILCH6UAez4_11 0 SO LAY THAT OUT
GILCH6UAez4_12 0 I FIND THE CENTER OF THE WING PUT IT DIRECTLY DOWN WE END OF THE BUGGY WORKING ALONG THE LEADING EDGE
GILCH6UAez4_13 0 I'M GOING TO LAY THE LEADING EDGE OF THE GLIDER IN A NICE HARD FROM ONE SIDE AND THE SAME THING ON THE OTHER SIDE
GILCH6UAez4_14 0 THE REASON WE DO THAT IS IF WE PULL THE TIP WE COULD EASILY CAUSE OCCUR THAT IN THE GLIDER WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT SO WE START ALONG THIS LEADING EDGE PLAYING THE GLIDER OUT WITHOUT ANY LINES OVER
GILCH6UAez4_15 0 OR YOU CAN SEE THIS VERY CLEAN LEADING EDGE HERE
GILCH6UAez4_16 0 AT THAT POINT WE WANT TO COME BACK AND JUST CLEAR EACH OF THE RISERS
GILCH6UAez4_17 0 PRIMARILY WE'RE GOING TO CLEAR THE A LINE IS GOING TO THE FRONT OF THE WING AND I'M HERE TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE CLEAN
GILCH6UAez4_18 0 IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A BREEZE YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE THE WIND TO HELP YOU LAY OUT THE GLIDER BY GENTLY INFLATING IT OFF AND SETTING IT DOWN
GILCH6UAez4_19 0 IT'S A PERFECT LAYOUT RIGHT THERE AND WE'RE READY TO ATTACH THE TRIKE
GlCP-x3YvYI_1 0 HI I'M GRETCHEN SOARES AND WELCOME TO EXPERT VILLAGE
GlCP-x3YvYI_2 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE MAKING SOY CANDLES
GlCP-x3YvYI_3 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO BE HEATING THE SOY
GlCP-x3YvYI_4 0 WE'RE GOING TO USE A METAL POUR POT AND IT'S METAL THROUGHOUT WITH THE HANDLE ON IT SO IT DOESN'T FALL ON THE POT
GlCP-x3YvYI_5 0 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR SOY AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT THEM IN THE PORE POT
GlCP-x3YvYI_6 0 SO IT'S JUST SET IN THERE
GlCP-x3YvYI_7 0 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS AND PUT IT IN OUR DOUBLE BOILER
GlCP-x3YvYI_8 0 WE'RE GOING TO USE A PAINT STIR STICK TO STIR THIS AS IT STARTS MELTING
GlCP-x3YvYI_9 0 SO IT'S GOING TO BOIL FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND YOU'RE GOING TO STIR IT OCCASIONALLY FOR MELTING
GlCP-x3YvYI_10 0 SO AS THIS IS ON THE STOVE IT'S GOING TO BE MELTING AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE CONSISTENCY SUCH AS THIS
GlCP-x3YvYI_11 0 WE'RE GOING TO KEEP STIRRING IT AND KEEP LETTING IT NOW
gyM46ZenVQ4_1 0 OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO THE MOST IMPORTANT SHOT IN THE GAME AND THAT'S THE BRAKE
gyM46ZenVQ4_2 0 I SAY IT'S MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHOEVER HAS THE BRAKE ACTUALLY HAS CONTROL OF THE TABLE AT THAT POINT IN TIME
gyM46ZenVQ4_3 0 SO NOW IT'S STANCE REASON WHATEVER THEY DO WITH THE BREAK BEAT IT GOOD OR BAD THAT'S ON THEIR SHOULDERS
gyM46ZenVQ4_4 0 BUT WHAT THEY WANT IS SOMETHING GOOD TO HAPPEN
gyM46ZenVQ4_5 0 SO THE OBJECTIVE ON THE BRAKE IS TO OF COURSE POCKET AT LEAST ONE BALL WHICH IS THEN GOING TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY AT THE TABLE AND THEN TRY TO POCKET MORE BALLS
gyM46ZenVQ4_6 0 HOWEVER IF YOU DON'T BREAK PROPERLY AND SAY YOU SCRATCH ON THE BRAKE OR YOU DON'T POCKET A BALL ALL YOU'RE DOING AT THAT POINT IS JUST TURNING CONTROL OVER THE TABLE TO YOUR OPPONENT
gyM46ZenVQ4_7 0 AND IF YOU BROKEN UP REALLY GOOD BUT YOU DIDN'T POCKET THE BALL AND YOU TURN CONTROL OF THE TABLE OVER TO YOUR OPPONENT ALL YOU'VE DONE IS JUST OPEN EVERYTHING UP SO THAT YOUR OPPONENT HAS AN EASY ROAD TO RUN OUT AND BE CHEW OFF OF YOUR OWN BREAK
gyM46ZenVQ4_8 0 SO WE WANT TO LOOK REAL QUICK
gyM46ZenVQ4_9 0 WHAT MAKES A GOOD BREAK
gyM46ZenVQ4_10 0 WE WANT TO CONTROL BREAK
gyM46ZenVQ4_11 0 AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT A LOT OF BEGINNING PLAYERS DO THAT REALLY IS NOT PROPER IS PUTTING THE CUE BALL TOO FAR BACK WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TOO MUCH DISTANCE TO TRAVEL FROM THAT POINT UP TO THERE
gyM46ZenVQ4_12 0 SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS PUT IT UP TO THE NEAREST LEGAL LIMIT THAT YOU CAN WHICH IS RIGHT UP ON THAT HEAD STRING AS SO
gyM46ZenVQ4_13 0 AND THEN YOU WANT TO PUT IT SOMEWHERE AROUND THE CENTER OF THE TABLE YOU WANT TO MAYBE STAND WITH A LITTLE MORE UPRIGHT STANCE
gyM46ZenVQ4_14 0 BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO GET AS MUCH SPEED AND FOLLOW THROUGH ON THIS SHOT AS POSSIBLE
gyM46ZenVQ4_15 0 NOW WE'RE BACK TO THE LEVEL CUE REAL FOR SURE
gyM46ZenVQ4_16 0 BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS BALL COMING UP OFF THE TABLE AND WE WANT IT TO GO STRAIGHT DOWN HERE
gyM46ZenVQ4_17 0 WE DON'T WANT TO USE IN THE ENGLISH SQUIRT CUE BALL OFF ONE SIDE OF THE OTHER
gyM46ZenVQ4_18 0 WE WANT TO CONTACT THAT BALL FALL AND WE WANT TO HIT IT AS FAST AS WE CAN
gyM46ZenVQ4_19 0 SO WE'RE BACK TO A VERY LONG FOLLOW THROUGH AND AS FAST THEY HIT AS WE CAN MAKE IT
gyM46ZenVQ4_20 0 THERE WE GO
HcXjjA9Fcxw_1 0 ALRIGHT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WITH DECORATING OUT

HcXjjA9Fcxw_5 0 IT'S GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE PINK BORDER HERE BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO GO RIGHT ON MY DESK

HcXjjA9Fcxw_7 0 IN A AND YOU CAN EVEN DO THIS BEFORE IF YOU WANT TO PAINT DESIGNS ON YOUR SHELLS THAT IS ANOTHER GREAT IDEA TO JAIL
HcXjjA9Fcxw_8 0 SO MAKE SURE I REMEMBER ONCE AGAIN WHEN USING THESE PAINTS AND RAISING ACRYLIC PAINT I GIVE YOURSELF ABOUT AN HOUR PERCH
HcXjjA9Fcxw_9 0 SO IF NOT YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH ALL KINDS OF THINGS RUNNING TOGETHER
HcXjjA9Fcxw_10 0 SMELLY THAT CUTE LITTLE BORDER TO MATCH OUR OTHER BORDERS
HcXjjA9Fcxw_11 0 I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO APPLY SOME MORE PAINT THESE LITTLE SHELLS HERE
HcXjjA9Fcxw_12 0 AND THIS ACRYLIC PAINT IS GREAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH ANY POROUS SURFACE LIKE SHELLS OR WOOD IS GOING TO SET THAT PAINT RIGHT UP SO I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS
HcXjjA9Fcxw_13 0 ACRYLIC PAINT IS A GREAT ALL PURPOSE PAINT FOR CRAPS
HcXjjA9Fcxw_14 0 THIS IS THEM DELI THERE S THOSE JUST LIKE SO
GJczM8S_qLY_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M LAURA BANFORD AND
GJczM8S_qLY_2 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE SUPER LASAGNA AND CAESAR SALAD
GJczM8S_qLY_3 0 NOW THAT WE'VE DICED UP OUR ONIONS AND OUR GARLIC WE'RE GOING TO DICE UP OUR CARROTS
GJczM8S_qLY_4 0 CARROTS ADD AN IMPORTANT BALANCE TO A TOMATO SAUCE A RED CELLS HAS A LOT OF ACID VIA THE TOMATOES AND CARROTS BALANCE THAT OUT WITH THEIR IN HURT SWEETNESS
GJczM8S_qLY_5 0 WE HAVE SOME A COUPLE OF CARROTS A REGULAR OLD CARROTS DON'T HAVE TO BE ANYTHING FANCY IT ALL DO THE SAME THING
GJczM8S_qLY_6 0 IF YOU WERE JUST IF I WAS MAKING CHARACTERS A SIDE DISH I GO FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT PROBABLY THERE'S AS SOMETHING CALLED AN DANCE ANY AND TVS CARROT THAT'S A LITTLE FRENCH CARROT THAT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL
GJczM8S_qLY_7 0 OR MAYBE A BONAFIDE BABY CARROTS AND NOT THOSE UP THOSE BAG CARROTS THAT ARE CUT TWO THEY'RE REALLY BIG CARROTS CUT SMALL TO LOOK LIKE BABY CARROTS
GJczM8S_qLY_8 0 BUT ACTUAL BABY CARROTS WITH THE TOPS ON THEM TO MAKE A REALLY NICE SIDE DISH YOU SAUTE THEM WITH A LITTLE OLIVE OIL BUTTER AND HONEY
GJczM8S_qLY_9 0 BUT FOR THIS PURPOSE CARDS ARE GOING TO PULL ME OLD CARE TO LEND THERE THERE SWEETNESS TO A RED SAUCE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE
GJczM8S_qLY_10 0 I'M JUST PEELING THE THIN SKIN OFF THE OF VEGETABLE PEELER IS REALLY USEFUL FOR THIS AS OPPOSED TO A PARING KNIFE BECAUSE YOU SEE HOW THE CUFF IN THE SKIN IS AND HOW EASILY IT JUST COMES RIGHT OFF WITHOUT SACRIFICING ANY OF THE CARROT
GJczM8S_qLY_11 0 WE WANT TO GET OUR SKIN OFTEN AND THEN WE WANT TO KIND OF A UNIFORM DICE SO AS I SAID CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO CREATE ALL THE CARROTS COOK THE SEAM RATE AND I'M JUST GOING TO CUT THEM INTO MANAGEABLE PIECES SO THEY'RE NOT ROLLING AROUND MY CUTTING BOARD
GJczM8S_qLY_12 0 THEN WE CAN DO SOME OF THE FINGERS ON THE WAY OF COURSE JUST DO IT AGAIN WITH THIS ONE
GJczM8S_qLY_13 0 AND AFTER WE FINISH WITH PREPPING THESE CARROTS AND WE'RE READY TO START COOKING AND WE'RE GOING TO START BY SAUTEING OUR SAUSAGE AND SOME BUTTER AND OLIVE OIL SEASON
gwmAYPMpAx4_1 0 IF YOU'VE EVER EMBARKED UPON A PROFESSIONALLY RYAN WEIGHT LOSS OR EXERCISE PROGRAM IT'S MOST LIKELY THE FIRST THING YOU WERE TOLD YOU NEED TO GET WAS A HEART RATE MONITOR
gwmAYPMpAx4_2 0 THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STYLES AND TYPES OF HEART RATE MONITORS AND IT BASICALLY THE FUNCTION IS THE SAME
gwmAYPMpAx4_3 0 IT'S TO TAKE A RUNNING TALLY OF WHAT YOUR HEART RATE IS AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT AND TO HELP YOU WORK UP TOWARDS YOUR TARGET HEART RATE AND NOT EXCEED YOUR MAXIMUM HEART RATE
gwmAYPMpAx4_4 0 I THINK THAT JUST FOR THE BLAME IN A HEART RATE MONITORS NOT SUCH A TERRIBLE THING TO HAVE AS IT CAN HELP MAKE YOUR OWN WORKOUT IN WEIGHT LOSS OF FOR IT'S MORE EFFICIENT WHETHER YOU'RE PART OF PROFESSIONAL PROGRAM OR NOT
gwmAYPMpAx4_5 0 HER RATE MONITOR START AT ABOUT FIFTY SIXTY DOLLARS AND WORK UP TO TWO OR THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR SOME OF THE SMALLER NON WORKOUT FINGERTIP VARIETIES
gwmAYPMpAx4_6 0 AND REALLY IT'S A MATTER OF WHAT'S GOING TO BE COMFORTABLE FOR YOU AND NOT PURPOSES YOU'RE LOOKING TO USE THE HEART RATE MONITOR FOR
gwmAYPMpAx4_7 0 A WORKOUT OR INTO ONE OF COURSE IS FOR WORKING OUT
gwmAYPMpAx4_8 0 AND IF YOU JUST WANT TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR HEART RATE FOR A DIFFERENT MEDICAL REASON AT HOME IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE LOGICAL TO SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GET A FINGERTIP MONITOR
gM3izByOIUI_1 0 NOW I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LASER PRINTERS
gM3izByOIUI_2 0 THIS IS JUST A STANDARD HOME HORSE SMALL OFFICE LASER PRINTER THAT PRETTY MUCH ANYBODY CAN GO AHEAD AND GET
gM3izByOIUI_3 0 NOW THERE'S SEVERAL COMPONENTS ON IT
gM3izByOIUI_4 0 OF COURSE I HAVE MY PAPER FEEDBACK HERE
gM3izByOIUI_5 0 I HAVE TWO DIFFERENT TRAYS ACTUALLY FOR HIGH IF I WANTED TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PAPER
gM3izByOIUI_6 0 SO I COULD HAVE MY STANDARD PAPER HERE AND MAYBE ENVELOPES OR MAYBE EVEN A DIFFERENT COLOR PAPER UP HERE FOR DIFFERENT THICKNESS SOMETIMES SUCH AS SOME TYPE OF CARDBOARD OR WHAT NOT
gM3izByOIUI_7 0 SO WE HAVE WE HAVE A LITTLE LIFT BACK HERE WHICH CAN HOLD THE PAPER UP OF COURSE TO
gM3izByOIUI_8 0 AND WE HAVE A LIST OF HERE THAT WILL HOLD THE PAPER WHEN IT ACTUALLY COMES OUT AFTER BEING PRINTED
gM3izByOIUI_9 0 SO GO AHEAD AND CLOSE THAT THOUGH
gM3izByOIUI_10 0 IN THE EVENT OF THE PAPER GENDER SEVERAL THINGS YOU CAN DO
gM3izByOIUI_11 0 ON THIS PARTICULAR UNIT WHICH MOST OF THEM HAVE THEY'LL HAVE A TRAY ON THE BOTTOM WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO PULL PAPER OUT IF SOMETHING DOESN'T GET STUCK
gM3izByOIUI_12 0 SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND CLOSE THAT BACK UP
gM3izByOIUI_13 0 SO NOW REMEMBER LASER PRINTER ACTUALLY DOES USE A TYPE OF LASER TO BURN THE THE IMAGE WHATEVER IT IS USUALLY TEXT ONTO THE PAPER
gM3izByOIUI_14 0 IT IS VERY VERY HOT AND IT IS NOT LIKE YOUR INK JET CARTRIDGES
gM3izByOIUI_15 0 SO ANYTHING THAT SAYS INKJET ONLY AS FAR AS PAPERS ARE TRANSPARENCIES THINGS LIKE THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO USE IN A LASER PRINTER
gM3izByOIUI_16 0 I FOUND THIS ARE ABOUT THE HARD WAY THE OTHER DAY TRYING TO USE A TEE SHIRT TEE SHIRT TRANSFER PAPER INSIDE A LASER PRINTER AND I GOT THE GLUE EVERYWHERE
gM3izByOIUI_17 0 SO THAT'S SUCKED AND I HAVE TO GO AHEAD AND CLEAN IT
gM3izByOIUI_18 0 SO JUST USE REGULAR COPY PAPER TO DO ANYTHING YOU'RE GOING TO BE A PRINTING WITH YOUR LASER PRINTER
gM3izByOIUI_19 0 SO LET ME SHOW YOU ONE THIS UNIT I CAN GO AHEAD AND PULL UP THE ENTIRE FRONT THAT WHAT YOU HAVE LASER PRINTERS ACTUALLY HAVE A THING CALLED THE TONER
gM3izByOIUI_20 0 SO THIS ONE HAS A GRIP AND GO AHEAD YANK IT OUT
gM3izByOIUI_22 0 AND THIS IS ACTUALLY WITH BURNS THE IMAGE ONTO YOUR PAPER
gM3izByOIUI_23 0 SO THIS HAS THE INK BASICALLY THAT WILL BE IN HERE TO PUT THE IMAGE WHATEVER IT IS IF IT'S A PICTURE OR TEXT ONTO YOUR PAPER
gM3izByOIUI_24 0 SO IN THE EVENT YOU NOTICE THAT YOUR TONER ISN'T PRINTING CORRECTLY AND DOWN AND YOU HAVE SOME LETTERS MISSING WILL OR IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE GO AHEAD AND GIVE YOUR TONERS SHAKE BEFORE GOING AHEAD AND REPLACING A GOOD HAND SEATING TRYING TO BUY A NEW ONE
gM3izByOIUI_25 0 THESE ARE KIND OF EXPENSIVE BUT THEY DO LAST A LONG TIME
gM3izByOIUI_26 0 SO INSTEAD OF BUYING BLACK AND ALL THE TIME YOU'RE IN JET PRINTER GO AHEAD AND GET YOURSELF A LASER PRINTER
gM3izByOIUI_27 0 SO ONCE YOU'RE DONE WHETHER IT'S A NEW ONE OR YOUR PLACEMENT YOU A FEW SHAKING IT
gM3izByOIUI_28 0 YOU GO AHEAD AND LOCK IT BACK INTO PLACE
gM3izByOIUI_29 0 SO I HAVE SOME FANS HERE TO KEEP EVERYTHING COOL
gM3izByOIUI_30 0 IT ACTUALLY SAYS THAT GOES UP TO THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIXTY BREEZE THAT'S PRETTY HOT
gM3izByOIUI_31 0 SO ONCE YOU'RE DONE YOU GO AHEAD AND CLOSE THE DOOR
gM3izByOIUI_32 0 IT'LL DO IT'S LITTLE RUN THROUGH
gM3izByOIUI_33 0 MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S RIGHT
gM3izByOIUI_34 0 THE SAME WAY YOUR INK JET PRINTER WOULD CYCLE THROUGH AND MAKE SURE YOUR TRICK CARTRIDGES OF IN PLACE PROPERLY
gM3izByOIUI_35 0 SO THERE'S A BUNCH OF INDICATOR LIGHTS INSIDE TO IF WE NEED TO LOAD PAPER IF THERE'S A JAM IF THERE'S AN AIR OR WHAT NOT
gM3izByOIUI_36 0 SO IT'S PRETTY SELF EXPLANATORY
gM3izByOIUI_37 0 YOU GO AHEAD AND TURN IT ON PLUG IT INTO YOUR COMPUTER AND GO AHEAD AND PRINT
gM3izByOIUI_38 0 SO WHEN YOU REPLACE JUST A LITTLE POINT WHEN YOU'RE REPLACING YOUR TONER GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT TO A PROPER PLACE
gM3izByOIUI_39 0 THE TONERS ARE PRETTY TOXIC SO WHEN YOU BUY A NEW TONER COMEDY USUALLY HAVE A RETURN SHIPPING BOX ON THE INSIDE THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO SEND IT BACK TO MANUFACTURE
gM3izByOIUI_40 0 AND SOMETIMES WILL GIVE YOU A CREDIT
gM3izByOIUI_41 0 EVEN IF THEY DON'T IT HELPS ENVIRONMENT SO GO AHEAD AND WHAT YOU GOT A PRINT AND ENJOY YOUR LASER PRINTER
H6w-P4QrTzc_1 0 DO YOU WORK IN A JOB WHICH REQUIRES YOU TO CONTINUOUSLY REPEAT THE SAME MOVEMENT ON YOUR WRIST

H6w-P4QrTzc_8 0 SO IF WE TAKE OUR THUMB AND PRESS IT ACROSS YOUR WRIST JUST INHALE AND FLEX THE WRIST AND THEN EXHALE AND EXTEND THE WRIST
H6w-P4QrTzc_9 0 SO WE'RE JUST BRINGING SOME BLOOD FLOW TO YOUR WRIST STRETCHING CONTRACTING THE FOUR ARM TO BRING THE BLOOD FLOW TO RELIEVE CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME
H6w-P4QrTzc_10 0 THIS ALSO WORKS IF YOUR ARMS YOUR WRIST GET TIRED IN A DOWNWARD FACING DOG
H6w-P4QrTzc_11 0 YOU CAN DO THIS ANYWHERE IN THE CAR AT YOUR DESK AT HOME
H6w-P4QrTzc_12 0 JUST ONE OF THE MANY THINGS YOU CAN DO TO RELIEVE CARPAL TUNNEL TUNNEL SYNDROME
GyujcYMIqV0_1 0 WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT ADVANCED FORWARD STROKE NOW FOR KAYAKING

GyujcYMIqV0_8 0 SO I GO AHEAD AND SIT DOWN IN MY KAYAK LIKE I'M SITTING IN THE BOAT AGAIN MY KNEES ARE SLIGHTLY BENT
GyujcYMIqV0_9 0 WHAT I WANT TO DO INSTEAD OF JUST PULLING AND PUSHING WITH MY ARMS WHEN I REACH FORWARD SEE HOW MY WHOLE BODY ROTATES FORWARD LIKE THIS
GyujcYMIqV0_10 0 I'M GOING TO PLANT THE KAYAK PADDLE IN THE WATER AND THEN I WANT TO ROTATE MY ENTIRE BODY BACK LIKE THIS

gOVsnN8kKuw_1 0 MOST ACCESS THE WIRES BY REMOVING THE DASH PANEL AND TAP AND THEN TO ACCESSORY ONE ACCESSORY TO IGNITION ONE IGNITION TO AND STARTING POSITION
gOVsnN8kKuw_2 0 OF COURSE WHEN TAPPING INTO THOSE CIRCUITS YOU MUST USE PROTECT THE CIRCUIT IS BEING TAPPED INTO ANY MUST NOT EXCEED THE POWER RATING THAT THE VEHICLE EXCEEDS
gOVsnN8kKuw_3 0 OVER HERE WE HAVE THE RADIO
gOVsnN8kKuw_4 0 THE RADIO AND MOST VEHICLES WORK IN ACCESSORY POSITION
gOVsnN8kKuw_5 0 WHEN THE CARS CRANK IN THE RADIO GOES OUT
gOVsnN8kKuw_6 0 WHEN THE CAR RETURNS BACK TO THE EXCESSIVELY POSITION THE RADIO STAYS OPERABLE
gOVsnN8kKuw_7 0 SAME THING WITH THE EXCESSIVELY CIRCUIT WHEN VEHICLES STARTED AND THE KEY IS RELEASE BACK TO THE ACCESSORY POSITION THAT AIR CONDITIONING BLOWER WILL WORK WINDOWS GOING GO UP AND DOWN AND SOME ENDS
gMoUt7T6rGc_1 0 A GOOD SPOT FOR THE SWITCH IT ACTUALLY I AM A TURN
gMoUt7T6rGc_2 0 IS OUT IT'S GOING TO FIT A PRETTY NICELY I THINK UNDERNEATH THE UNDERNEATH THE CIRCUIT BOARD HERE
gMoUt7T6rGc_3 0 BUT ONE LITTLE A TRICKY THING WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IS IS HOW TO GET A WHOLE CUT IN THE SAME BIG ENOUGH TO FIT THE SWITCH INTO AND IT'S A PRETTY BIG SWITCH
gMoUt7T6rGc_4 0 AND SO A DREMEL TOOLS THAT THING TO USE FOR THAT
gMoUt7T6rGc_5 0 I STARTED BY DRILLING SOME PILOT HOLES AND SEE A DRILLS SOME PUTT DRILL SOME PARTICLES INTO THE KEYS HERE
gMoUt7T6rGc_6 0 SO I'M JUST GOING TO KIND OF KEEP USING THE DRILL AND MAYBE IF YOU USE A LITTLE SERRATED KNIFE OR SOMETHING
gMoUt7T6rGc_7 0 LIKE I SAY DREMEL TOOLS REALLY GOOD FOR THIS BUT I JUST WANT TO GET A HOLE IN THIS IT'S BIG ENOUGH TO ON HOLD THE SWITCH AND TRYING TO PUT IN BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE A GOOD SPOT FOR IT

GQsL3mTN3W4_2 0 MY NAME IS JEFF RIGHT FOR YOU
GQsL3mTN3W4_3 0 TODAY I'LL BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO REMOVE AND REPLACE THAT WATER PUMP ON A MAZA SIXTH OF SIX
GQsL3mTN3W4_4 0 BECAUSE THE USE OF A JACK IN THE JACK STANDS COULD BE NECESSARY AND BEFORE WE CAN REMOVE THE MOTOR MOUNT
GQsL3mTN3W4_5 0 REPLACING REPLACING THE JACK UNDERNEATH THE PAN IS THE BEST SPOT TO JACK UP YOU IN SO YOU DON'T PUT A HOLE IN THE PAN FOR PAN ITSELF
GQsL3mTN3W4_6 0 CHECKING THE HEIGHT OF THE ENGINE ITSELF
GQsL3mTN3W4_7 0 YOU WANT TO BE THROWS
GQsL3mTN3W4_8 0 JUST ENOUGH TO TAKE OFF THIS DIDN'T TENSION OFF OF THE BOWL AND AMOUNT
GQsL3mTN3W4_9 0 JACKS AND JACK STANDS NEED TO BE PLACED ON IN THE JUST IS SECURED VEHICLE SO IT DOESN'T FALL TUMBLE
GQsL3mTN3W4_10 0 YOU WANT TO REMOVE GUITAR ARE THE CARDS SO
GQsL3mTN3W4_11 0 AFTER THE VEHICLES IS SECURE WITH THIS STANCE OFF THE AIR OFF THE GROUND OR MOVE FROM THE NUTS OR IF I WERE TO REMOVE THE TIRE
GQsL3mTN3W4_12 0 I LIKE THIS IT THIS TIRE UNDERNEATH THE FRAME TO FILL THIS SEWN BUMPS INTO THE CAR KNOCKS IT OFF THE STANCE IT WILL FALL ENTIRE ITSELF AND THEN THE CARD DOESN'T FALL ON THE GROUND
H4HcC6deUEQ_1 0 WELL THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO TAKE THE BOWL OFF THE CUISINARTS AND BRING IT OVER TO THE BALL THAT YOU HAVE A MAZZARELLA HIM AND REMOVE ALL OF THE CHEESE WHICH IS NOW SLIGHTLY TINTED GREEN FROM THAT FRESH BASIL WHICH IS REALLY GREAT IT AND THEN ON OUR NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO PUT IT ON OUR BAGUETTE SLICES WHICH ARE PURPOSE TEENY I PUT IT ON FAIRLY THICK LIKE THIS MOUNTING IT AND GETTING IT ABSOLUTELY TO EVERY EDGE OF THE BAG OUT
H4HcC6deUEQ_2 0 AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH HOW YOU DO IT
H4HcC6deUEQ_3 0 JUST SIMILARLY I'VE GOT A TINY BAKING SHEET READY AND WHEN THESE ARE ALL FINISHED WHEN YOU'VE WHEN YOU'VE DONE ALL OF THESE THEN WE PUT ON A SLICE OF A SUN DRIED TOMATO ACROSS AT AN ANGLE LIKE THAT SO THAT IT LOOKS REALLY PRETTY
H4HcC6deUEQ_4 0 AND I DO THEM ALL THE SAME BECAUSE YOU'LL SEE WHEN WE'RE RANGE IT ON A PLATTER THAT IT WILL BE BEAUTIFUL
H4HcC6deUEQ_5 0 NOW ONE THING I DID NOT SAY WAS THAT ABOUT SUN DRIED TOMATOES THEY GENERALLY COME INTO A JAR LIKE THIS THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BRAND
H4HcC6deUEQ_6 0 THEY COME IN OIL AND WHAT I GENERALLY DO IS PUT THEM IN A SIP OF SOME KIND OF I SAVE THE OIL TO USE FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE BECAUSE IT'S GOT A WONDERFUL FLAVOR OF SUN DRIED TOMATOES AND WHEN THEY DO WHEN I TAKE THEM OUT I SLICE THEM IN HALF BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY ALL YOU NEED FOR THIS HORS D'OEUVRES HALF ON TOP OF EACH LIKE THAT
H4HcC6deUEQ_7 0 SO I HAVE A WHOLE SMALL BOWL READY WITH ALL MY LITTLE HALVES I THINK I'VE TWELVE THERE AFTER THAT WE PUT THEM IN THE OVEN FOR SEVEN MINUTES AT THREE FEET
H4HcC6deUEQ_8 0 THE TOMATO CHEESE CRUSTY NICE OF JUST COME OUT OF THE TIME TO REMEMBER WE BAKE THEM AT THREE FIFTY FOR FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES
H4HcC6deUEQ_9 0 I WOULD RECOMMEND SETTING A TIMER AND CHECKING THEM AFTER FIVE MINUTES BECAUSE THE WAY THEY ARE NOW WHICH IS REALLY NICE AND PUFFY AND A MELTED THEY'RE ALMOST THEY'RE ALMOST LIKE LITTLE PIZZAS
H4HcC6deUEQ_10 0 CHILDREN LIKE THESE AS WELL AS ADULTS AND IT REALLY MAKES A BEAUTIFUL PRESENTATION WHEN YOU TAKE JUST A JUST A LITTLE SPRIG OF THE FRESH BASIL THAT YOU HAVE LEFT OVER FROM WHAT YOU BOUGHT AND ARRANGE IT ON THE PLATTER LOOKS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND YET RUSTIC AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THEY ARE DELICIOUS ENJOY

grsV1YN1z5s_15 0 SO LET'S GET STARTED
GD-8n8PDl44_1 0 BUT WHAT I WANT TO POINT OUT IF I MADE A IS THAT A HANDWRITING IS SO ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL
GD-8n8PDl44_2 0 AND WITHOUT THE ALPHABET WE EVERYTHING WOULD FALL APART
GD-8n8PDl44_3 0 EVERYTHING IN OUR CULTURE DEPENDS UPON THE ALPHABET
GD-8n8PDl44_4 0 ALWAYS SAVE YOURSELF WHAT WE HAVE COMPUTERS WILL EXCUSE ME BUT COMPUTERS DEPEND ON THE ALPHABET
GD-8n8PDl44_5 0 IF THE ALPHABET WOOD TO DISAPPEAR COMPUTERS WOULD HAVE NOTHING NO WAY OF ORGANIZED
GD-8n8PDl44_6 0 THEY WOULDN'T BE THEY WOULD JUST FALL APART
GD-8n8PDl44_7 0 AND THEN THAT WOULD BE NO SIGNS AND THEN THEY WOULD BE NO HANDWRITING TO SEND YOUR TRACKS AND EVERYTHING WILL JUST GO RIGHT DOWN THE TUBES
GD-8n8PDl44_8 0 SO PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ALPHABET IS CAN BE PRETTY IMPORTANT
GD-8n8PDl44_9 0 YOU KNOW WHAT I DO WHEN I MEET CHILDREN IF THEY'RE AROUND IN AGE WHEN I KNOW THEY MIGHT BE LEARNING ABOUT THE ALPHABET I ASKED THEM THIS FIG IMPORTANT QUESTION

GdwI5f0-sJc_1 0 HI MY NAME IS ELIZABETH AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GdwI5f0-sJc_2 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK TODAY IS BIRDS THAT BITE
GdwI5f0-sJc_3 0 THE NUMBER ONE REASON THAT MOST PARROTS BIKE IS AT A FEAR
GdwI5f0-sJc_4 0 SO IF YOUR BIRD IS BITING THE NUMBER ONE WAY FOR YOU TO GET YOUR BIRD TO STOP BITING IS TO FIGURE OUT WHILE YOUR BIRD IS BITING AND JUST CHANGE IT SO THAT YOUR NO LONGER THREATENING THIS ANIMAL IS NO LONGER FRIGHTENED
GdwI5f0-sJc_5 0 YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY PUSHING YOURSELF ON THIS BIRD OR EACH FRIGHTENED OR SOMETHING IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE THAT THIS IS THE LAST FORM OF SELF DEFENSE
GdwI5f0-sJc_6 0 MOST BIRDS IN THE WILD WOULD CHOOSE TO FLY AWAY VERSUS AGGRESSIVELY BITING YOU
GdwI5f0-sJc_7 0 SO MOST BIRDS WHEN THEY BITE IS LIKE A JOB THAT BITES THEY FEEL CORNERS
GdwI5f0-sJc_8 0 SO YOU NEED TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE THIS EXPERIENCE MORE COMFORTABLE
GdwI5f0-sJc_9 0 IF YOU HAVE A BIRD THAT BITES AND YOU WANT TO GET A PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR OUT OF THE SUCH AS STEP UP OR IF YOU'VE GOT THEM ALREADY ON YOUR HAND
GdwI5f0-sJc_10 0 WE'RE HERE IN JUST ABOUT GOOD GIRL
GdwI5f0-sJc_11 0 LET'S SAY FOR INSTANCE CURING WANTED TO BITE ME AND I WAS ABOUT TO JUST DO SOMETHING LIKE SAY STEP UP AND INSTEAD OF STEPPING UP START SHE SWITCHED AND SHE DECIDED THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BITE MY HAND SO WHAT I WOULD DO IS JUST AS SHE WAS REACHING WITH SORRY I'M SORRY AS SHE'S REACHING FOR HER BEAK WHAT I DO IS I'M WOBBLE MY HAND EVER SO SLIGHTLY JUST LIKE THIS AS YOU IS REACHING A BITE
GdwI5f0-sJc_12 0 WHAT THAT DOES IS THE NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT THEY DON'T LIKE LOSING YOUR BALANCE AND SO IT'LL STOP THE BITING BEHAVIOR
GdwI5f0-sJc_13 0 YOU CAN DO THIS TWO OR THREE TIMES UNTIL YOU CAN OFF YOUR HAND AND SHE'LL LONGER TRIES TO BITE BEFORE STANDING UP ONTO THE NEXT HAND
GdwI5f0-sJc_14 0 THAT'S ONE WAY TO START YOU KNOW JUST KEEP THEM FROM BITING FROM ONE HAND TO THE NEXT
GdwI5f0-sJc_15 0 AGAIN IT'S FAIRLY OF CAUSING IT TO BE A MORE POSITIVE EXPERIENCE BUT IMMEDIATELY YOU CAN KEEP YOU FROM GETTING THAT KNEE
GdwI5f0-sJc_16 0 FROM THE OTHER WAY AGAIN IS TO REACH FROM BEHIND THE BIRD
GdwI5f0-sJc_17 0 THE LAST METHOD TO KEEP PROVIDING IS TO ON OBVIOUSLY JUST OFFER A DISTRACTION AT THE SAME TIME
GdwI5f0-sJc_18 0 SECURE WANTED A BITE WHAT I WOULD DO IS I'D SAY STEP UP AT THE SAME TIME PUT SITE LEVERAGE CAN FLY SO THEY CAN CHOOSE TO NOT INTERACT WITH ME
GdwI5f0-sJc_19 0 YOU'D OFFER DISTRACTIONS SO IF I WAS GOING TO ASK HER TO STEP UP AT THE SAME TIME AND OFFER TO STEP UP AND OFFER DISTRACTION AT THE SAME TIME THIS CAN BE A PIECE OF YOU KNOW A POPSICLE STICK OR YOU KNOW A PIECE OF FOOD JUST HOW MANY OTHER HAND AND ASK THEM TO DO THE TWO ACTIVITY SIMULTANEOUSLY
GdwI5f0-sJc_20 0 SO YOU OFFER FOOD WALL OFFERING YOUR HAND
GdwI5f0-sJc_21 0 THIS OFTENTIMES DISTRACTING ENOUGH TO BREAK THE BITE BEHAVIOR
GdwI5f0-sJc_22 0 SO THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS TO STOP BITING THE NUMBER ONE WAYS TO DISTRACT ANY OTHER NUMBER ONE WAY WOULD BE TO FIGURE OUT WIDE THE BIRD WANTS TO BITE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE AND CHANGE UP THERE AND FIREMAN
GdwI5f0-sJc_23 0 TRY TO CREATE THE SITUATION SITUATED IS POSITIVE AND THE BIRD WANTS TO INTERACT ON SO THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BITE YOU INSTEAD
GVWXveM_fzE_1 0 THE FOUR BALL SIDE BY SIDE MULTIPLEX START
GVWXveM_fzE_2 0 JUST LIKE THE THREE BALL MULTIPLEX START IT'S A COOL WAY TO START
GVWXveM_fzE_3 0 I MEAN IT'S BETTER THAN JUST DOING THIS
GVWXveM_fzE_4 0 PEOPLE LIKE TO SEE A GOOD FLASHY MOVE TO START
GVWXveM_fzE_5 0 SO THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD ONE AND IT'S PRETTY BASIC
GVWXveM_fzE_6 0 STEP TO FOUR BALLS IN YOUR HANDS LIKE THIS OKAY
GVWXveM_fzE_7 0 IT'S A WRIST MOTION AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS IN THE AIR YOU WANT THEM TO SPLIT AND FORM COLUMNS
GVWXveM_fzE_8 0 IT'S VERY EASY THE BOTTOM TWO YOU CATCH AND THEN IT'S AUTOMATICALLY COLUMNS JUST LIKE THAT
GVWXveM_fzE_9 0 IT'S A FLICK OF THE WRIST OKAY
GVWXveM_fzE_10 0 THAT WASN'T THE SMOOTHEST EVER BUT YOU GET THAT YOU GET THE POINT
GVWXveM_fzE_11 0 THAT IS A VERY COOL START AND IT DOESN'T TAKE A WHOLE LOT OF PRACTICE AND IT DOESN'T TAKE A WHOLE LOT OF TECHNIQUE
GVWXveM_fzE_12 0 IT'S FAIRLY SELF-EXPLANATORY
GVWXveM_fzE_13 0 THE KEY ONCE AGAIN IS IN THE RISK FLICK
GVWXveM_fzE_14 0 SO WORK ON THAT AND YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD FOUR BALL START
gWeZqePefHE_1 0 SO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE YOURSELF AN ANKLE SUPPLY AS ALWAYS OF RAGS AND PAPER TOWELS
gWeZqePefHE_2 0 WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE MESSY BUSINESS OF ADHESIVE YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOMETHING AVAILABLE THAT'S CLEAN AND DRY ON IN ORDER FOR YOU TO WIPE OFF
gWeZqePefHE_3 0 ATTENDING TO USE YOUR FINGERS A LOT
gWeZqePefHE_4 0 YOU'LL SEE AS I GO ON FURTHER BUT I ALWAYS LIKE TO HAVE A NICE CLEAN OR TOWEL THAT I TEND TO USE AND THEN I PREFER THE SHOP TOWELS MOSTLY BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE USING ANY SORT OF STANDARD KITCHEN TOWELS THEY TEND TO BREAK APART FALL APART AND ACTUALLY GETS STUCK TO YOUR FINGERS AS YOU'RE TRYING TO WIPE OFF ADHESIVES
gWeZqePefHE_5 0 THESE ARE MORE LIKE A FABRIC SO THEY DON'T TEND TO FALL APART IS EASY ALMOND ALSO THEY'RE GREAT FOR USING I ACTUALLY ON THE SURFACE OF YOUR PIECE FOR CLEANING UP EDGES AND WIPING AWAY EXTRA ADHESIVE THAT'S MAYBE ON BEEN APPLIED TO THICKLY
gWeZqePefHE_6 0 SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING CLEAN AND DRY TO WORK WITH AND HAVE AN AMPLE SUPPLY OF EXTRA PAPER TOWELS SO THAT IF YOU SHOULD RUN THROUGH THEM ALL YOU HAVE EXTRAS TO USE AND YOU CAN JUST THROW WHAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH
H6qfaaYf5RI_1 0 RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT DOING IT SPIN TRICKS WITH THE TASSEL SPIN

H6qfaaYf5RI_4 0 THE CRUST TASSEL SPIN TECHNIQUE IS VERY DIFFERENT
H6qfaaYf5RI_5 0 IT LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THAT
H6qfaaYf5RI_6 0 NOW WHAT I'M ACTUALLY DOING IS I'M SPINNING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE STICK GETTING AN OUTSIDE SPIN ON THE TASSEL TAKING MY LEG OVER AND LETTING THE STICK AND JUST ROLL OVER MY LEG LIKE THAT AND BACK OUT TO MY RIGHT CONTROL STICK JUST LIKE THAT
H6qfaaYf5RI_7 0 NOW TO WORK ON THIS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET THIS CATCH DOWN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE USED TO KICKING YOUR LEG UP AND CATCHING THE UNDERSIDE OF THE CRYSTAL STICK ON OR SO AT THE TOP SIDE THE CRYSTAL STICK ON THE UNDERSIDE OF YOUR LEG AT THE RIGHT BALANCE POINT THAT JUST SPINS OVER NICE AND EASY LIKE THAT
H6qfaaYf5RI_8 0 THAT'S UNDER THE LEG WITH A TASSEL SPIN
H6qfaaYf5RI_9 0 NOW I AM I REALLY LIKE THIS TRICK
H6qfaaYf5RI_10 0 THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES AND THAT'S WHAT THE MAIN REASONS I PLAY WITH CRYSTAL STICKS INSTEAD OF DOUBLE STICKS IS THAT I CAN EXECUTE THAT RIGHT THERE
gcHR4jFmiis_1 0 BEFORE YOU GO IN A CAVE DON'T GO ALONE AND DON'T GO WE TELL WITH ANY GUY

GD5-_-fIAOg_10 0 WHEN YOU CHANGE POSITIONS WALK AROUND OR STAND THAT IT'S MOST LIKELY THAT YOUR CONTRACTION IS GOING TO GET HARDER AND STRONGER AND IT'S GOING TO BE MORE INTENSE
GD5-_-fIAOg_11 0 WHICH IS A GOOD THING BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP MOVING AROUND YOU WANT TO GET THOSE LABOR PAINS GOING TO HOPEFULLY MAKE LABOR NOT LAST AS LONG
GD5-_-fIAOg_12 0 SO WHEN YOU GET A CONTRACTION AND START TO THE TOP OF YOUR UTERUS AND WORKS ITS WAY DOWN
GD5-_-fIAOg_13 0 THE UTERUS IS LIKE FINGERS IN THE WAY IT IS ALL TOGETHER
GD5-_-fIAOg_14 0 SOME WOMEN S SAY THAT IT FEELS LIKE REALLY HARD MENSTRUAL CRAMPS
GD5-_-fIAOg_15 0 OTHER WOMEN FEEL AT TIGHTENING SENSATION
GD5-_-fIAOg_16 0 OTHER WOMEN MIGHT FEEL AND THE BACK BUT DEPENDING ON THE POSITION OF THE BABY
GD5-_-fIAOg_17 0 SOME WOMEN FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE GAS WHEN IT'S JUST STARTING
GD5-_-fIAOg_18 0 IT'S VERY HARD TO DESCRIBE WHAT LATER PAIN FEELS LIKE BECAUSE IT FEELS DIFFERENT FOR EVERYONE
GD5-_-fIAOg_19 0 SO THE UTERUS IS CALLED THE FUNGUS
GD5-_-fIAOg_20 0 AND THE UTERUS IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT POT DIFFERENT LIGAMENTS ALMOST THERE LIKE FINGERS
GD5-_-fIAOg_21 0 THEY COME IN TOGETHER LIKE THIS AND THEY COME IN TOGETHER LIKE THIS
GD5-_-fIAOg_22 0 AND THEY'RE ALL OVER
GD5-_-fIAOg_23 0 SO WHAT HAPPENS IS FROM THE TOP OF YOUR UTERUS THOSE FINGERS START SQUEEZING
GD5-_-fIAOg_24 0 SO YOU'RE HAVING SENSATIONS THIS WAY YOU'RE HAVING SENSATIONS THIS WAY YOU'RE HAVING SENSATIONS THIS WAY
GD5-_-fIAOg_25 0 AND THIS FINGER IS GOING TO WORK IT DOWN AND YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL IT TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF YOUR UTERUS
GD5-_-fIAOg_26 0 TOWARDS THE BEGINNING WHEN YOU'RE CONTRACTIONS ARE NOT VERY STRONG IT JUST MIGHT BE THAT YOUR STOMACH IT'S HARD
GD5-_-fIAOg_27 0 THAT'S YOUR UTERUS CONTRACT INK
GD5-_-fIAOg_28 0 AND THEN AS YOUR UTERUS RELAX THAT YOUR STOMACH IS GOING TO GET SOFT AGAIN
GD5-_-fIAOg_29 0 SO GREAT WAY TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE TRULY IN LABOR IS WHEN YOU HAVE CONTRACTIONS TO GET CLOSER TOGETHER AND LAST LONGER

h39vEROaZc4_1 0 NOW THE FRAME THAT WE'VE CREATED NEEDS A WAY TO STAND UP ONTO THE BASE OF OUR STAGE SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A THE MAKE THE WOODEN STICKS GO INSIDE THE CORRUGATED PAPER AND THAT WILL CREATE A STAND IN ORDER FOR US TO STICK IT INSIDE THE BASE OF THE STAGE
h39vEROaZc4_2 0 SO IF WE CUT OUR STRIPS CORRECTLY THE THE LINES OF THE CORRUGATED PAPER SHOULD BE RUNNING ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE STRIP
h39vEROaZc4_3 0 SO I HAVE ROOM TO TAKE A FIN SKEWER AND PUT IT INSIDE THE THE OPENING OF THE CORRUGATED PAPER
h39vEROaZc4_4 0 WHEN I FIRST WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO USE THE FULL LENGTH OF THE STICK IT'S NOT NECESSARY SO I'M GOING TO CUT A PIECE AND I'M GOING TO BE LEFT WITH A PIECE PROBABLY ABOUT FIVE INCHES IS IS IT IS A GOOD SIZE
h39vEROaZc4_5 0 AND I CUT TWO STICKS LIKE THAT
h39vEROaZc4_6 0 I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND STICK IT INSIDE THE CORRUGATED PAPER
h39vEROaZc4_7 0 IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE GETTING IT IN IF YOU DIDN'T USE A THICK ENOUGH CORRUGATED PAPER YOU CAN TWIST THE STICK BACK AND FORTH AND IT WILL SLIDE IN OR YOU CAN JUST PRESS IT DOWN ONTO A HARD SURFACE BECAUSE THE THE STICK SHOULD FIT RIGHT INTO THE LONG RUN ALONG THE LINES OF THE CORRUGATED PAPER
h39vEROaZc4_8 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT PUSHING ITSELF OUR OR TURN THE FRAME
h39vEROaZc4_9 0 SO WE PUT IN HIGH ENOUGH SO THAT IT CREATES A WILL BE STURDY TO CREATE A NICE BASE AND WE SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH LEFT OUT TO BE ABLE TO STICKING TO THE BASE OF THE STAGE
h39vEROaZc4_10 0 IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE PART OF THE STICK THAT STICKING OUT SHOULD BE BOTH OF THEM SHOULD BE EVEN SO THAT THE FRAME STAND STRAIGHT UP AND BUT BY THE WEIGHT OF THE THE BORDER THE THICKNESS OF THE CORRUGATED PAPER AND ALSO THE STICKS THAT ARE INSIDE THIS WILL CREATE A NICE STRONG STURDY SUPPORT TO LET THE THE BORDER STAND UP STRAIGHT ON TO THE BASE OF THE STAGE
h39vEROaZc4_11 0 SO NOW I'VE SHOWN YOU HOW TO INSERT THE WOODEN SKEWER STICKS INTO THE PICTURE FRAME BORDER SO THAT IT WILL STAND DIRECT ONTO THE BASE OF OUR PUPPET STAGE THEATER
gKedb-Yc-zI_1 0 ANOTHER WAY TO USE COME NOT JUST FOR JUMPS IS TO HAVE AGAIN OUT ON THE TRAIL OR WE CAN HAVE THEM JUMP UP ON ROCKS HAVE THEM JUMP UP ON A WIDE SENSE IF YOUR DOG IS NIMBLE ENOUGH AND YOU JUST HAVE SOME FUN WITH THAT
gKedb-Yc-zI_2 0 IT WORKS THEIR BRAIN AS WELL AS THEIR BODIES AND IT INCREASES THE BOTTOM BETWEEN YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE WORKING TOGETHER
gKedb-Yc-zI_3 0 SO FOR KARMA WE'RE GOING TO USE THIS STEP INSTEAD OF A BOLDER SENSE THERE'S NOT ANY IN THE YARD
gKedb-Yc-zI_7 0 NOW AS YOU SEE I'M ALMOST MAKING AN OBSTACLE COURSE
gKedb-Yc-zI_8 0 I'M HAVING A GET UP ON THE BOLDER
gKedb-Yc-zI_9 0 I'M BACKING UP HAVING YOUR COME AGAIN
gKedb-Yc-zI_10 0 YOU'LL NOTICE I'M NOT NECESSARILY HAVING A TURN AROUND TO ME IN THIS VERSION OF COME BUT I AM EXPECTING HER TO COME STRAIGHT TO ME AND JUST SIT
gt0Y5ZSZ7Cs_1 0 AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT SCIENCE HAS BEEN SHOWING A SLIGHTLY IS THAT THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN OUR EMOTIONAL HEALTH AND OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH
gt0Y5ZSZ7Cs_2 0 FOR EXAMPLE THE A UNIVERSAL CHICAGO OR SOME KIND OF A STEADY THAT I'M SHOWED THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE LONELY TEND TO HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL HAPPEN TO HAVE A HIGHER LEVELS OF THE FIREFLY LIGHTER FIGHT CHEMICALS THAT WOULD PRODUCE WE'RE STRESS AND IT'S KIND OF A CHRONIC THE IN OVER TIME THEY FOUND THAT THAT THAT CAN CAUSE INFORMATION THE BODY AND CONNECTING CONTRIBUTE TO A WHOLE RANGE OF UP THE STARTERS
gt0Y5ZSZ7Cs_3 0 SO IT'S INTERESTING THAT SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS LONELINESS CAN HAVE THAT LARGER IT CAN IT CAN ACTUALLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON YOUR HOUSE
gt0Y5ZSZ7Cs_4 0 SO THE IDEA HERE IS I PROBABLY IS A GOOD IDEA TO GO A HAPPY FRIENDS TO HAVE HANGING CHECK AND MAKE THE ACETONE RECENT STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EVEN COMPANIONSHIP NECESSARILY THERE'S ALSO BEEN VERY POSITIVE HEALTH BENEFITS OF HAVING A PET FOR EXAMPLE
gt0Y5ZSZ7Cs_5 0 BUT THE IDEA IS THAT I'M HAVING COMPANIONSHIP IN FRENCH AT IN A PERSON'S LIFE IS IMPORTANT FOR CONTRARY TO OVERALL HEALTH OF YOUR PHYSICAL BODY

gLxrMPVZhsQ_2 0 THIS FIRST WITH THE BEANS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT ESPRESSO IS THAT THE ROASTED FOR THE ESPRESSO OR THE ESPRESSO BLEND IS DARKER THAN NORMAL COFFEE WHICH ISN'T NECESSARILY TRUE WHICH MEANS THAT YOU CAN USE WHATEVER COFFEE THAT YOU LIKE
gLxrMPVZhsQ_3 0 THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS IS ANY FLAVORS THAT ARE THAT ARE IN THE BEANS ARE BROUGHT OUT OR EVEN MORE INTENSE IN AN A CUP OF CAUGHT AND THAT KIND OF ESPRESSO AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THEIR IT RATHER THAN A NORMAL CUP OF COFFEE THE RATIOS OF COFFEE TO HOT WATER GROUND COFFEE TO HOT WATER IS MUCH HIGHER

gblMsZ2QOcM_4 0 THAT IS AND JUST SOMETHING YOU WROTE THAT IS ACTUALLY PUBLISHED
gblMsZ2QOcM_5 0 SO YOU CAN SHOW IT TO SOMEONE PERSPECTIVE CLIENTS SAY I GOT THIS AND IT WAS PUBLISHED
gblMsZ2QOcM_6 0 WILL YOU HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE
gblMsZ2QOcM_7 0 SO ALWAYS TELL YOU WHAT WORKS FOR ME AND THEN YOU'VE FIGURED OUT AS YOU GO
gblMsZ2QOcM_8 0 BUT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES IT TO START SMALL AND USE YOUR SPEED SMALL PROJECTS THAT DON'T PAY WELL
gblMsZ2QOcM_9 0 MAYBE IT'S LITTLE PAID MAYBE IT'S A LOT OF WORK AND YOU DON'T FALL AND GETTING THE KITE USER
gblMsZ2QOcM_10 0 I WOULD RECOMMEND DOING THAT FOR VERY LONG
gblMsZ2QOcM_11 0 BUT I RECOMMEND DOING IT YOU KNOW A COUPLE WEEKS UNTIL YOU HAVE A FEW PIECES SAMPLES AND THEN YOU YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN START YOU KNOW AFTER FOR BETTER PAPER BIGGER JOB
gblMsZ2QOcM_12 0 SO ONE WAY I BROKE AND WAS WHEN I FIRST DECIDED THAT I REALLY WANTED TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT FOR THAT SAY I JUST WITH A LOT THEMSELVES OUT THERE
gblMsZ2QOcM_13 0 AND I NOTICED I DIDN'T I I WAS CAREFUL TO NOT LOOK FOR PROJECTS THAT WERE JUST MAYBE ON MY EIGHTY X EXPERTISE IN MY EXPERIENCE
gblMsZ2QOcM_14 0 I THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC
gblMsZ2QOcM_15 0 BUT I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS THAT THEY NEED TO THEM THEY NEEDED A WRITER TO COVER THE SLANT DANCE FILM FESTIVAL
gblMsZ2QOcM_16 0 AND THE SLED THAT STILL FESSEL RUNS CONCURRENT WITH SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL WHICH IS THAT THEY SELL
gblMsZ2QOcM_17 0 AND THAT'S ONE AND IF YOU GET A BIG DEAL TO BUT IT'S KIND OF MORE FINE IN INDIAN YOU CAN SEE YOU KNOW WHERE THEY WANT TO THE RIGHT OR THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE PUBLISHED IN ALL THESE AMAZING PLACES THAT CAN CITY
gblMsZ2QOcM_18 0 SO ACTUALLY AND THAT JUST SITTING IN A FEW LITTLE SAMPLES I'VE ALREADY DONE AND THEY LIKE MY RIGHT KNEE AND MAKING
gblMsZ2QOcM_19 0 SO I WOULD HAPPEN
gblMsZ2QOcM_20 0 THEY'RE ENERGY PEOPLE AND I WROTE SOME ARTICLES ABOUT THIS LINE DANCE EXPERIENCE AND IT'S A MOVIE YOU USE
gblMsZ2QOcM_21 0 SO THAT MAYBE SOME GREAT CLIPS TO START
gblMsZ2QOcM_22 0 THAT WAS NIGHT
gblMsZ2QOcM_23 0 AND THEN FROM THERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY MOVE DOWN TO RIDING COPY FOR A COSMETIC COMPANY AND YOU KNOW THAT WASN'T MY DREAM JOB TO THE RIGHT ABOUT HOW THIS LIPSTICK WAS GOING TO MAKE YOUR LIPS LUSCIOUS AND LOW BUT IT WAS A SPRING BOARD FOR OTHERS
gblMsZ2QOcM_24 0 GOT TO SAY HERE I CAN PUBLISH IN THIS YOU KNOW IN THIS COSMETIC CATALOG AND WHAT NOT AND I I CREATED COPY

gblMsZ2QOcM_27 0 AND IF YOU'RE GOOD WRITER YOUTH UNITS RIGHT ABOUT ANYTHING
gt8bTw8IUYU_1 0 I'M FROM BIKES THAT DON'T HAVE QUICK RELEASES IT BASICALLY LOOKS LIKE THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS YOU ARE LEVER HERE IT'S JUST THE BOLT BOLGER'S ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LEFT SIDE LIKE THIS ONE THIS BECAUSE THERE'S A LEVER ON THE OTHER SIDE
gt8bTw8IUYU_2 0 BUT WE WOULD STICK A TOOL IN THERE AND WE WOULD A LOWER RAISE THE SEAT HEIGHT
gt8bTw8IUYU_3 0 SO I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS IS A FOUR MILLIMETER WRENCH I'M GOING TO LOOSEN IT UNTIL I CAN ADJUST THE SEAT HEIGHT AND THERE WE GO
gt8bTw8IUYU_4 0 SO FINDING THE RIGHT SEAT HEIGHT IS ANOTHER MATTER ENTIRELY
gt8bTw8IUYU_5 0 WHAT I LIKE TO DO AS JUST THE RULE OF THUMB LIKE THAT FIND SOMETHING TO LEAN AGAINST GET BACK ON THE BIKE AND WHEN YOU'RE WEARING THE SHORTS OR PANTS THAT YOU RIDE IN THE SHOES THAT RIGHT IN AND I DON'T USE THE RIGHT OF THESE PANTS OR SHOES
gt8bTw8IUYU_6 0 WHAT I DO IS I LOOK FOR THE APPROPRIATE KNEE ANGLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PEDAL STROKE WHICH IS ABOUT THE ANGLE THAT I HAVE HERE LIKE A TWENTY TWENTY FIVE DEGREE ANGLE
gt8bTw8IUYU_7 0 I COULD PROBABLY LOWER MY SEAT A LITTLE BIT BUT WHEN YOU LOWER YOUR SEAT TOO MUCH YOU END UP HAVING A PRETTY UNCOMFORTABLE RIDING POSITION
gt8bTw8IUYU_8 0 IT'S NOT A SUFFICIENT HURT YOUR KNEES ALL THAT GOOD STUFF
gt8bTw8IUYU_9 0 SEE TOO HIGH ALSO NOT A FISH AND ALSO GREAT FOR INJURY
gt8bTw8IUYU_10 0 THE BEST WAY TO MEASURE SEAT HEIGHT IS THE TAPE MEASURE MEASURING EIGHT CONSISTENTLY FROM THE CENTER OF THE BOTTOM BRACKET WHICH IS THAT BOLT RIGHT THERE TO THE CENTER OF THE SEAT TUBE
gt8bTw8IUYU_11 0 I LIKE TO MEASURE IT STARTING AT THE TEN MILLIMETER MARK THIS LINE THAT UP OVER THE CENTER OF THE BOLT AND THEN UP TO THE CENTER OF THE SADDLE AND
gt8bTw8IUYU_12 0 LOOKS LIKE I SET MY SEAT RIGHT JUST BY GUESSING THERE BECAUSE I LIKE TO RUN A SEVENTY THREE AND A QUARTER OR OR SEVEN THREE POINT TO FIVE MILLIMETER SEAT HEIGHT AND THAT'S A THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT
gt8bTw8IUYU_13 0 SO DON'T YOUR SEAT TOO HIGH FROM TRY TO RECORD REMEMBER WHAT YOUR MEASUREMENTS ARE IN CASE YOU HAVE TO MESS WITH THINGS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR SEAT NICE AND LEVEL AND GET OUT THERE AND HAVE A GOOD RIDE

gthuH54_BoM_10 0 SO QUESTION AUTHORITY

Ge9UMjIPT1Y_4 0 SPECIFICALLY HOW TO BE STRONG FOR HER OR
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_5 0 JUST WHAT DO WE MEAN BY BY HOW TO BE STRONG FOR HER
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_6 0 YOU CAN TAKE IT TWO WAYS
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_7 0 THE PHYSICAL ASPECT COULD BE HOW DO YOU CARRY YOUR WIFE OR YOUR PARTNER UPS UPSTAIRS TO THE BEDROOM
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_8 0 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHICH MADE LEAD TO THAT
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_9 0 BUT IT'S REALLY THE THE EMOTIONAL OR THE SPIRITUAL SIDE
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_10 0 HOW TO BECOME STRONG FOR AN INDIVIDUAL MOSTLY OR SPIRITUAL
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_11 0 AND IT'S REALLY KIND OF A CHARACTER BASED A CHARACTER BASED THING FOR THE HUSBAND ARE FOR THE MAN
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_12 0 YOU REALLY NEED THE MAN NEEDS TO BE A PERSON OF IN YOUR STRENGTH FIRST OF ALL
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_13 0 BEFORE YOU CAN BE STRONG FOR SOMEBODY ELSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME INNER CONFIDENCE
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_14 0 YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR YOUR HEAD ON STRAIGHT
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_15 0 YOU NEED TO HAVE YOUR THOUGHTS ALIGNED
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_16 0 YOU NEED TO BE A PERSON OF CHARACTER
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_17 0 ANOTHER THING THAT'S IMPORTANT IS REALLY THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO BE EMPATHETIC TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION AND UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR WIFE OR YOUR PARTNER YOUR GIRLFRIEND IS GOING THROUGH
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_18 0 PERHAPS IT'S A SITUATION WHERE I'M GOING TO CHOOSE GOING THROUGH AN ILLNESS
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_19 0 PERHAPS SHE WAS LATE OFF FROM HER JOB OR GOING THROUGH SOME DIFFICULTIES WITH HER FAMILY
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_20 0 YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND SITUATION PROVIDER LISTENING HERE THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_21 0 THE EMPATHETIC SO THAT YOU CAN APPRECIATE WHAT SHE'S GOING THROUGH THAT TIME
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_22 0 EITHER TO SUPPORT HER
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_23 0 MAYBE HELPER OUT
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_24 0 MAYBE THERE'S TASK THAT YOU CAN THAT YOU CAN HELP OUT TO TAKE TO TAKE THINGS OFF OF OUR PLATE
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_25 0 OTHER THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO WOULD BE BE THEIR PHYSICALLY FOR
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_26 0 MAYBE IT'S HOLDING HER HAND TELLING TYING HER THAT YOU DO LOVE HER YOU SUPPORT HER AND THAT YOU WILL BE THERE FOR
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_27 0 THESE ARE ALL VERY IMPORTANT THINGS
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_28 0 AT TIMES YOU WILL NEED TO DEMONSTRATE IN IN CHARGE ATTITUDE
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_29 0 MEANING THAT BASICALLY YOU MAY HAVE TO TAKE CONTROL ABSURD SITUATIONS
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_30 0 BE PREPARED TO DO THAT
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_31 0 REMEMBER THERE'S THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF THINGS
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_32 0 THERE'S EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL SIDE
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_33 0 YOU NEED TO BE A GIVING PERSON
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_34 0 THE HALLMARK OF A STRONG MAN IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO GIVE AND BE EMPATHETIC
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_35 0 SO YOU NEED TO APPRECIATE WITH THAT PERSON IS GOING THROUGH
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_36 0 ONCE SHE HAS GONE TO THAT SITUATION THEN IT'S A MATTER OF GOING BACK TO LIFE HOPEFULLY AS USUAL
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_37 0 AND THEN YOU CAN WORK ON BUILDING THAT RELATIONSHIP
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_38 0 YOU CAN TRUST THAT THAT RELATIONSHIP WILL BE MUCH STRONGER IF YOU SUPPORTED AND PROVIDED THE RIGHTS LEVEL OF SUPPORT
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_39 0 THAT'S HOW WE CAN BE STRONG FOR HER
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_40 0 I'M JOE CUENCO WITH FAMILY RESOURCES RELATIONSHIPS FOR LIFE
Hk5WNr-RFE8_1 0 HI I'M MIKE PAYNE OWNER ACADEMY FOR THE MARTIAL ARTS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE ON THE TOPIC OF WHAT TO LOOK FOR MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOL
Hk5WNr-RFE8_2 0 I WOULD AVOID SCHOOLS WHERE THE CLASSES OR TWO CROWD
Hk5WNr-RFE8_3 0 YOU'VE GOT THE STUDENT TEACHER RATIO IS A VERY HIGH
Hk5WNr-RFE8_4 0 THEY DON'T HAVE A FOUR WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE SAFE IF THEY FALL DOWN
Hk5WNr-RFE8_5 0 A MEETING WITH THESE
Hk5WNr-RFE8_6 0 KEEP THAT ENERGY UP GETTING IS UP
Hk5WNr-RFE8_7 0 HE PAY ATTENTION
Hk5WNr-RFE8_8 0 EACH TRACK AND YOU HAVE TO DO THAT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE TIME IT
Hk5WNr-RFE8_9 0 IF YOU'VE GOT VERY YOUNG INSTRUCTORS A IF YOU'VE GOT INSTRUCTORS YOU'VE GOT TEENAGE STUDENTS OR MAYBE LET'S SAY GREENBELT LEADING THE CLASS I WOULD DEFINITELY AVOID THAT
Hk5WNr-RFE8_10 0 AND WE WERE CURRENT
Hk5WNr-RFE8_11 0 BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S SCHOOLS LIKE LIKE THE ONE THAT THEY DO THEY AFTER SCHOOL THEY GET LIKE FIFTY OR SIXTY SEVENTY KIDS IN ONE CLASS
Hk5WNr-RFE8_12 0 AND YOU HAVE YOU KNOW WHERE THEY CAN GET TO HELP YOUR CAGE
hF48m-fxAGo_1 0 SO THE FIRST STEP DURING ON THE WHEEL IS TO CENTER THE CLAY
hF48m-fxAGo_2 0 FIRST YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR BALL OF CLAY AND YOU WANT IT TO BE AS ROUNDS POSSIBLE THAT MAKES CENTERING MUCH EASIER AND THROW IT DOWN PRETTY HARD RIGHT ON THE CENTER OF THE WHEEL
hF48m-fxAGo_3 0 AND THEN YOU NEED TO HAVE A BUCKET OF WATER AND SPONGE IN FOR ME THE WAY THAT I CENTER IS EILEEN ON THE SPLASH PAN WITH MY LEFT ARM AND THAT KEEPS MY LEFT ARM FOR MOVING
hF48m-fxAGo_4 0 I PUT ALL MY BODY WEIGHT INTO THAT AND I TRY TO TRANSFER IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE HEEL OF MY LEFT HAND
hF48m-fxAGo_5 0 THIS HAND IS GOING NOT GOING TO BE MOVING AND IT'S MY RIGHT HAND IT'S GOING TO BE DOING THE WORK
hF48m-fxAGo_6 0 SO I'LL GET THE SPONGE WET ENOUGH THAT IF I SQUEEZE IT WATER COMES OUT BUT IT'S NOT DRIPPING
hF48m-fxAGo_7 0 AND I'LL SQUEEZE IT A LITTLE BIT SO THAT I CAN GET THIS BALL MOIST AND THEN I'LL TAKE MY RIGHT HAND AND PUSH TOWARDS MY LEFT HAND AND UP AND THEN DOWN USING THE HEEL OF MY LEFT HAND TO KEEP THAT CLAY FROM PUSHING OUT VERY FAR
hF48m-fxAGo_8 0 AND ONCE IT LOOKS AND FEELS LIKE IT'S NO LONGER MOVING YOU'VE GOT A CENTERED LUMP OF CLAY
Hfg1NJxVHog_2 0 WELCOME TO EXPERT VILLAGE
Hfg1NJxVHog_3 0 MY NAME IS WAYNE PETERSON AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE IMPORTANT BIRD AREAS PROGRAM FOR THE MASSACHUSETTS AUDUBON SOCIETY
Hfg1NJxVHog_4 0 TODAY WE'RE HERE AT THE DANIEL WEBSTER WILDLIFE SANCTUARY IN MARSHFIELD MASSACHUSETTS WHERE WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT BIRD IDENTIFICATION AND SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT AND ESSENTIAL TOOLS THAT ARE USEFUL TO GET ONE STARTED IN THIS AND CREDIBLY INTERESTING PASTIME
Hfg1NJxVHog_5 0 ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT BIRD IDENTIFICATION IS TO REMEMBER WHERE YOUR BIRDING
Hfg1NJxVHog_6 0 WHAT'S THE HABITAT SPECIFICALLY IN THE LOCATION WHERE YOU'RE SPENDING TIME
Hfg1NJxVHog_7 0 FARSON WOODLANDS ARE CERTAINLY ONE OF OUR MORE FAMILIAR HABITATS AND ACROSS NORTH AMERICA REPRESENT ONE OF THE MAJOR ECOSYSTEM TYPES
Hfg1NJxVHog_8 0 ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF BIRDING IN FAR SAYS THE FACT THAT THERE IS A LOT OF FOLIAGE AND OFTEN UNDERCOVER THAT CAN MAKE OBSERVING BIRDS MORE DIFFICULT
Hfg1NJxVHog_9 0 AND THE FACT THAT IN MANY CASES BIRDS ARE OVER YOUR HEAD
Hfg1NJxVHog_10 0 YOU MAY HAVE TO BE LOOKING UP
Hfg1NJxVHog_11 0 AND YOU HAVE THE PROBLEM OF BACK LIGHTING AND SO FORTH MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT IN MANY CASES TO SEE THE BIRDS
Hfg1NJxVHog_12 0 SO BIRD VOCALIZATION THIS AND SOUNDS LIKE WE DISCUSSED EARLIER CAN OFTEN BE VERY USEFUL
Hfg1NJxVHog_13 0 BUT SOME OF THE BIRDS THEY'RE QUITE TYPICAL OF FORESTED SITUATIONS INCLUDE FIRST OF ALL CANOPY SPECIES BIRDS THAT LIKE TO SPEND THEIR TIME HIGH IN THE TREES
Hfg1NJxVHog_14 0 THESE WOULD BE THINGS LIKE ROWS BREASTED GROSBEAKS SCARLET TEMPERATURES RED IBERIA'S FOR EXAMPLE LOTS OF THE WARBLERS
Hfg1NJxVHog_15 0 THEN THERE ARE SPECIES THAT SORT OF OCCUR AT MID STORY
Hfg1NJxVHog_16 0 WE MENTIONED THE WOOD THRUSH EARLIER AS BEING A SPECIES THAT OFTEN LIKES TO SING FROM SORT OF MID STORY IN THE FOREST CANOPY SITUATION
Hfg1NJxVHog_17 0 SOME OF THE FLY CATCHER'S ARE OFTEN FOUND AT MID LEVEL RATHER THAN HIGH IN THE TREES
Hfg1NJxVHog_18 0 AND THEN THERE ARE BIRDS THAT ACTUALLY OCCUR DOWN ON THE FOREST FLOOR OR IN THE UNDER GROWTH
Hfg1NJxVHog_19 0 AND THE WARBLER FOR EXAMPLE LIKE THE OVEN BIRD THAT NESTS ON THE GROUND WOULD BE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A SPECIES THAT THAT WOULD BE A TYPICAL SORT OF FOREST FLOOR DWELLER
Hfg1NJxVHog_20 0 SO IN BIRDING IN THESE HABITATS IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE WATCHING FOR MOVEMENT AT ALL LEVELS TO MOVE QUIETLY TO WEAR CLOTHING THAT IS RELATIVELY UNOBTRUSIVE SO YOU WON'T START OF THE BIRDS AND TO BE PARTICULARLY VIGILANT FOUR SOUNDS THAT WILL PERHAPS LEAD YOU TO THE THE BIRD OR IN SOME CASES IF YOU RECOGNIZE THE VOCALIZATION WILL ACTUALLY TELL YOU WHAT IT IS
Hfg1NJxVHog_21 0 BUT THESE CAN BE VERY RICH AND PRODUCTIVE HABITATS IT ALMOST ALL TIMES OF THE YEAR
Hfg1NJxVHog_22 0 BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY BEST AND MOST EASILY BIRD IN SOME TIME AND MID SPRING TO EARLY SUMMER WHEN THERE IS LIKELY BE A LOT OF BIRD ACTIVITY AND SPECIFICALLY SONG THAT WILL LEAD YOU TO WEAR BIRDS MAY BE

ghI5ayeMEhw_17 0 THIS IS REALLY SIMPLE MOST YOU CAN DO IT
ghI5ayeMEhw_18 0 AND THEN AN INWARD ONE AND A HALF FLIPS PIKE
ghI5ayeMEhw_20 0 THIS CATEGORY IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE HARDEST IF NOT THE HARDEST BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE SCARY OKAY AND THAT
ghI5ayeMEhw_21 0 IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS PROPERLY I DON'T SUGGEST YOU TRY THIS BECAUSE YOU COULD HURT YOURSELF
ghI5ayeMEhw_22 0 SO WE'RE DOING THE HAMMER GRIP TODAY TO DYES INWARD DIVE PIKE AND AND ONE AND A HALF
hFbspZHar5M_1 0 WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT HOW TO PREPARE YOUR PLATFORM STATEMENT FOR PAGEANT
hFbspZHar5M_2 0 POINT THREE SHOULD STAY INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF AND WHY YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE QUALIFIED TO CARRY OUT THE TASKS OF DOING YOUR SPECIFIC PLATFORM
hFbspZHar5M_3 0 HOW YOU EXHIBIT LEADERSHIP SKILLS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE YOUR PLATFORM SUCCESSFUL ONE
hFbspZHar5M_4 0 AND THE NEXT THING THAT WE'RE GOING TO COVER IS INCORPORATING YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE INTO YOUR PLATFORM
hFbspZHar5M_5 0 I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO BE ABLE TO RELATE TO YOUR PLATFORM
hFbspZHar5M_6 0 IN EVERY PARAGRAPH OF YOUR PLATFORM STATEMENT IT IS IMPORTANT TO STAY AT HOW YOU HAVE PERSONALLY BEEN AFFECTED BY SOMETHING RELATED TO YOUR PLATFORM

gDx4dELC820_1 0 THE MARINE ORGANISM WE'RE GOING TO IDENTIFY NOW IS THE SLENDER FILE FISH
gDx4dELC820_2 0 THE SLENDER FILE FISH IS ONE OF THE SMALLER OF OF THE FILE FISH SPECIES
gDx4dELC820_3 0 THEY RANGE IN SIZE FROM TWO TO THREE AND A HALF INCHES IN LENGTH
gDx4dELC820_4 0 THEY HAVE A SLENDER ELONGATED HEAD WITH A VERY SMALL MILES
gDx4dELC820_5 0 AS WITH ALL FILE FISH THE FIRST SPINE OF THE DORSAL FIN IT'S MUCH LONGER THAN THE OTHERS AND CAN BE USED WHEN EXTENDED TO LOCK THE FISH INTO A SMALL LOOK IN THE REEF SO THAT THEY CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO REMOVE
gDx4dELC820_6 0 SLENDER FILE FISH ARE GENERALLY A SHADE OF BROWN EITHER A REDDISH YOUR YELLOWISH BROWN TO GRAY ON THE TOP PART OF THEIR BODY AND THEN A LIGHTER COLOR ON THE BOTTOM HALF
gDx4dELC820_7 0 THEY ALSO FREQUENTLY HAVE PARTICULARLY DID MARKINGS OVER THEIR BODY BUT THOSE MARKINGS MAY NOT ALWAYS BE OBVIOUS
gDx4dELC820_8 0 IN FACT SUNDER FILE FISH CAN DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE COLORS TO BETTER BLEND IN WITH THEIR BACKGROUND
gDx4dELC820_9 0 SLENDER FILE FISH ALSO HAVE A LARGE EXTENDABLE BELLY APPENDAGE CALLED THE DO LAP THAT USUALLY HAS A YELLOW BORDER ON THE TRAILING EDGE
gDx4dELC820_10 0 SLENDER FILE FISH ARE GENERALLY FOUND HIDING IN THE BRANCHES OF GORGONIAN IT'S
gDx4dELC820_11 0 THEY ARE QUITE SHINE AND WILL SLOWLY MOVE EITHER DEEPER INTO THE GORGONIAN ONE APPROACH BY DIVERS OR WILL MOVE SLOWLY AROUND THE BACKSIDE OF THE GO GOING A BRANCH TO HIDE FROM THE OBSERVER
gDx4dELC820_12 0 SLENDER FILE FISH FEED ON ELEGANT INVERTEBRATES
gDx4dELC820_13 0 THEY ARE RELATIVELY ON COMMONLY FOUND IN THE WATERS AROUND FLORIDA THE BAHAMAS AND THE CARIBBEAN
gDx4dELC820_14 0 THEY CAN BE FOUND IN DEPTHS FROM TEN TO SIXTY FEET AND ARE GENERALLY FOUND AS SOLITARY ANIMALS
gDx4dELC820_15 0 THAT'S THE SLENDER FILE FISH
gui9Jmr4hSU_1 0 SO NOW YOU'VE GOT A BUNCH OF BROKEN TILES WHEN YOU DO NEXT
gui9Jmr4hSU_2 0 IT'S TIME TO START POSITIONING THEM ONTO YOUR SUBSTRATE
gui9Jmr4hSU_3 0 THEY'RE COUPLE THINGS TO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE POSITIONING TILES
gui9Jmr4hSU_4 0 IF YOU HAVE A SHAPE OR ESSENTIAL FEATURE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ACCENT YOU NEED TO DO THAT SHAPE FIRST
gui9Jmr4hSU_5 0 FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE A HEART IN THE MIDDLE OR A SUN YOU WANT TO START WITH THAT SHAPE AND TILE THAT WHOLE SHAPE AND THEN TILE THE BACKGROUND
gui9Jmr4hSU_6 0 IT JUST MAKES IT EASIER THAT WAY
gui9Jmr4hSU_7 0 ONE THING I'M DOING IS BECAUSE THE TILES I'VE CHOSEN I'VE DECIDED THIS WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD RANDOM PATTERN
gui9Jmr4hSU_8 0 SO I'M GOING TO PUT DOWN A FEW PIECES IN A RANDOM THING AND TELL YOU WHAT I CONSIDER WHEN I PLACE MY TILES
gui9Jmr4hSU_9 0 FIRST OF ALL YOU DON'T WANT TO POSITION ALL OF YOUR TILES BEFORE STARTING TO GLUE THEM BECAUSE ONCE YOU START GLUING THEY'LL MOVE JUST A LITTLE BIT AND THEN IT'S NOT GOING TO FIT ANYMORE
gui9Jmr4hSU_10 0 SO YOU WANT TO JUST POSITION A FEW AT A TIME AND THEN GLUE THEM DOWN
gui9Jmr4hSU_11 0 THINGS I THINK ABOUT WHEN I POSITION MY TILES IS STARTING WITH THE CORNERS
gui9Jmr4hSU_12 0 IT'S NICE TO PUT A CORNER TO CORNER THAT WAY YOU GET A VERY NICE CLEAN EDGE
gui9Jmr4hSU_13 0 OTHER THINGS TO THINK ABOUT ARE SHAPE AND COLOR
gui9Jmr4hSU_14 0 I HAVE ONE PATTERN HERE ANOTHER PATTERN HERE MAYBE I NEED A SOLID COLOR HERE
gui9Jmr4hSU_15 0 YOU CAN ALSO THINK ABOUT GROUT LINES
gui9Jmr4hSU_16 0 I REALLY LIKE HAVING UNIFORM GROUT LINES WHICH MEANS A QUARTER OF AN INCH OF GROUT BETWEEN EVERY SINGLE PIECE
gui9Jmr4hSU_17 0 SOME PEOPLE DON'T CARE THOUGH THEY HAVE BIGGER GROUT LINES AND SMALLER GROUT LINES YOU CAN MAKE UP YOUR MIND WHAT LOOKS BEST FOR YOU
gui9Jmr4hSU_18 0 ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER IS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST PLACE PIECES ANYWHERE AND THEN TRYING TO FILL IN THE EMPTY SPACES
gui9Jmr4hSU_19 0 BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS YOU'RE GOING TO PLACE YOURSELF INTO A CORNER WHERE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO FIT ANY PIECE AND SOME WE'RE AWKWARD SPACE
gui9Jmr4hSU_20 0 ALTHOUGH IF THAT HAPPENS YOU CAN ALWAYS GO BACK TO YOUR NEIGHBORS AND A LITTLE PIECE THAT WILL FIT RIGHT IN THE SPACE AS NEEDED
heHbgPxMsKQ_1 0 THE FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY BEFORE WE GET TOO DEEP INTO THE DIET AND CARE AND THINGS LIKE THAT FOR THE CENTIPEDE IS RED DISCUSS HOW TO MAKE A GOOD ENCLOSURE FOR THE CENTIPEDE
heHbgPxMsKQ_2 0 ONE THAT'S ESPECIALLY A SKI PROOF
heHbgPxMsKQ_3 0 THAT'S REALLY ONE OF OUR MAIN CONCERN SHEARS CREATING A CLOSURE THAT HE CAN'T GET OUT
heHbgPxMsKQ_4 0 SO PERSONALLY WHAT I LIKE TO USE LIKE THESE JARS OF SOME TYPE OR ANOTHER
heHbgPxMsKQ_5 0 I LIKE THE GLASS ONES PREFERABLY
heHbgPxMsKQ_6 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE A PLASTIC ONES WITH A SNAP LID
heHbgPxMsKQ_7 0 WHATEVER IT IS AN EASY TO THE HAS VERY SECURELY
heHbgPxMsKQ_8 0 THE REASON I LIKE THESE TYPES OF JARS IS BECAUSE THIS SCREW TOP LID IT'S NOT GOING TO COME OFF ON ACCIDENT
heHbgPxMsKQ_9 0 ONCE IT'S ON IT'S ON
heHbgPxMsKQ_10 0 SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANY SORT OF A SIX
heHbgPxMsKQ_11 0 BECAUSE THAT IS A WE WANT TO AVOID SO
heHbgPxMsKQ_12 0 YOU CAN BUY THIS IT IN THE YOU KNOW SUPERMARKET OR OR PROBABLY ANY CRAFT STORE AS WELL
heHbgPxMsKQ_13 0 IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A LARGE MASON JAR LIKE OBJECT IS SOME SORT
heHbgPxMsKQ_14 0 SOME PEOPLE USE TOP WHERE TO THAT ARE LIKE STAY AWAY FROM THE PLASTIC
heHbgPxMsKQ_15 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH THAT
heHbgPxMsKQ_16 0 AND WE'RE START OFF WITH SECOND THIS GUY SHOULDN'T RUNNING ANYMORE THAN FIVE OR SIX BOX
heHbgPxMsKQ_17 0 BUT OF COURSE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT USEFUL FOR US THERE IS GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF MODIFICATION TO GET WHERE WE NEED TO BE
heHbgPxMsKQ_18 0 NOW A WHOLE LOT BUT DOES JUST A LITTLE BIT AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT NEXT HERE
GgHxdyX3sqI_1 0 SO ALTHOUGH I DON'T LIKE GLOPPY OR OVERLY THICK CLAM OR FISH CHOWDER YOU DO HAVE TO THICKEN IT A LITTLE BIT
GgHxdyX3sqI_2 0 AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE IS JUST REGULAR OLD ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR
GgHxdyX3sqI_3 0 I WOULDN'T USE WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR BLEACHED UNLEASHED I PREFER ON LEACH BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T MAKE THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENT SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS JUST SPRINKLE THIS IN TO THE ONIONS AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO MAKE THAT BACON FAT AND THIS FLOWER COOK
GgHxdyX3sqI_4 0 I'M GOING TO USE ABOUT THREE AND A HALF ALMOST FOUR TABLESPOONS OF FLOUR AND NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS SIMPLY TO JUST COOK IT
GgHxdyX3sqI_5 0 AND I'M A TURN THE HEAT DOWN A LITTLE BIT
GgHxdyX3sqI_6 0 THE ONE THING ABOUT FLOUR IS THAT IF YOU DON'T COOK IT TENDS TO HAVE A REAL PASTY FEEL TO IT
GgHxdyX3sqI_7 0 SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO COOK IT AND IF YOU USING IF YOU ARE USING BUTTER IN YOUR MAKING REALLY YOU WANT IT TO THE SMELL A BIT LIKE SHORT BREAK COOKIES AND THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW WHEN THE FLOWER WHEN THE FLOWERS DONE
GgHxdyX3sqI_8 0 BUT IN THIS CASE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THAT BACON FAT AND THEY WERE REALLY JUST GOING TO COOK IT TWO OR THREE MINUTES KEEP STIRRING IT CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BURN IT ALL ARE OR HOW TO TAKE ANY COLOR BECAUSE I'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF COLOR FROM OUR BACON TO BEGIN WITH I LIKE MY TOE TO BE AS WIDE AS IT CAN BE
GgHxdyX3sqI_9 0 WHAT WE'RE REALLY JUST GOING TO PUT THE FLOUR A LITTLE BIT TO TAKE AWAY SOME OF THAT PACING THAT'S
GgHxdyX3sqI_10 0 OKAY SO WELL THAT'S COOKING I WANT TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE NEXT PART OF THE LIQUID
GgHxdyX3sqI_11 0 OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE CREAM AND IN THIS CASE WE'RE GOING TO USE MILK BECAUSE I LIKE TO BE A LITTLE BIT THINNER
GgHxdyX3sqI_12 0 BUT THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT LIQUIDS YOU CAN USE
GgHxdyX3sqI_13 0 IF YOU ARE NOT ALLERGIC TO SHELLFISH I WOULD SAY ABSOLUTELY USE CLAM JUICE AND CLAM JUICES QUITE EXPENSIVE IT'S EASY TO FIND IT'S ALWAYS A IN AROUND THE TUNA FISH IN THAT KIND OF THING YOU'RE SUPER MARKET AND IT'S GOT A WONDERFUL CLEAN BRINING SEE FLAVOR
GgHxdyX3sqI_14 0 IF YOU DON'T HAVE IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE USING CLEANED USE YOU DON'T HAVE IT OR IN FACT IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO SHELLFISH THING I WOULD USE CHICKEN STOCK NOW
GgHxdyX3sqI_15 0 THE THING ABOUT CHICKEN STOCK IS THE VERY NEUTRAL STOCK SO IT WILL ALWAYS TAKE ON WHATEVER FLAVOR THAT YOU END UP ADDING AND ONCE WE PUT THE FISH IN THAT CHICKEN FLAVOR WILL REALLY GO AWAY
GgHxdyX3sqI_16 0 OBVIOUSLY IF YOU HAVE CLAM AND YOU HAVE FISH ARE GOING TO HAVE A MORE OCEAN SWEET FLAVOR BUT THE CHICKEN STOCK REALLY IS QUITE ACCEPTABLE AS WELL

gigW20f1Pec_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT A FEW MISTAKES THAT BEGINNING CONDUCTORS MIGHT MAKE
gigW20f1Pec_2 0 SO THE FIRST IS KEEPING ARM OUT
gigW20f1Pec_3 0 YOU WANT TO KEEP BOTH ARMS OUT YOU DON'T WANT HIM BACK HERE AND YOU KNOW YOU WANT THEM VISIBLE AND UP
gigW20f1Pec_4 0 AND SO YOU WANT THEM OUT HERE SO THAT THE WHOLE ORCHESTRA CAN SEE THEM AND YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S A THERE'S NO GOING BACK HERE AND GETS REALLY CONFUSING IT'S REALLY HARD TO FOLLOW CONDUCTOR THAT THAT IS CONDUCTING BACK HERE
gigW20f1Pec_5 0 AND SOME CONDUCTORS WILL DO IT BUT IT'S IT'S NOT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOOD PRACTICE TO GET INTO
gigW20f1Pec_6 0 SECOND THING IS ON A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU'RE YOU'RE BIDDING TIME YOU DON'T WANT YOUR ELBOW TO GET IN THE WAY
gigW20f1Pec_7 0 A LOT OF TIMES I BEGINNING CONDUCTORS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU START GETTING KIND OF SLOPPY WITH WITH YOUR PATTERN YOUR ELBOW IF YOU NOTICE IS AND MY ELBOWS ACTUALLY MOVING AT AND SAY I TELLING THE ORCHESTRA DIFFERENT TIME THAN THE TIP OF MY THE TIME
gigW20f1Pec_8 0 SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE A OR A WAVE EFFECT AND IT'S VERY CONFUSING BECAUSE THE CHOSEN THE BASES AND THIS SIDE MIGHT GET ONE OF THEM YOU KNOW ONE THING AND THEY THINK MY ELBOWS YOU KNOW THE FOLLOWING MY ELBOW ALMOST BECAUSE FROM THE YOU KNOW FROM THAT ANGLE IT LOOKS CONFUSING TO THE ORCHESTRA
gigW20f1Pec_9 0 AND THEN THE REST OF THE YOU KNOW PEOPLE THEY CAN SEE MY ELBOW ARE FOLLOWING THE TIP OF THE BATON SO IT GIVES THEM ALMOST LIKE A AN ECHO EFFECT
gigW20f1Pec_10 0 THEY'RE NOT SAYING THE SAME TIME
gigW20f1Pec_11 0 THE NEXT THING IS YOU OUT YOU ALWAYS WANT TO KEEP YOUR YOUR HANDS IN A A FORMAL GRACEFUL SORT OF POSITION

gigW20f1Pec_17 0 THE ORCHESTRA IS GOING TO PLAY LIKE YOU TELL THEM TO PLAY
gigW20f1Pec_18 0 AND IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY ON AND HOW YOUR HANDS LOOK
gigW20f1Pec_19 0 IT'S ALL ABOUT IT IF YOU'RE CONFIDENT UP THERE AND ESPECIALLY YOUNGER ON LESSON EXPERIENCE ORCHESTRAS WILL FIND IT WILL SEE CONDUCTOR THAT ISN'T AS EXPERIENCE OR CONFIDENT AND THEY WILL PICK UP ON THAT EITHER SUBCONSCIOUSLY OR CONSCIOUSLY AND THEY WILL PLAY ACCORDINGLY
gigW20f1Pec_20 0 SO YOU NEVER YOU NEVER WANT TO SLOUCH OR DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT
gigW20f1Pec_21 0 FACIAL EXPRESSION IS IMPORTANT IF YOU'RE PLAYING A YOU KNOW I'M PLAYING A PIECE OR THERE'S A SECTION THAT'S RENO SOMBER MORE SAD DON'T YOU KNOW DON'T BE SMILING DON'T BE GOOFY UP ON THE PODIUM

GtrYWhU8Tn4_3 0 THIS PROCESS IS THE SAME
GtrYWhU8Tn4_4 0 THE ONLY PART THERE'S DIFFERENT IS THE END SO CONTINUE AND ONE REACHING THERE TO SHOW YOU
GoZy_PICnGM_1 0 NOW SOME OF THE GROUPS LIKE COMEDY SPORTS OR SOME OF THE THEATER SPORTS GROUPS THEY'LL RAISE THE CHALLENGE ON THAT WHERE THEY'LL TAKE TURNS WITH EACH THAT ARE THE ALPHABET
GoZy_PICnGM_2 0 THEY'LL START ON ONE THEY CHOSE FROM THE AUDIENCE LIKE SAY L AND THEY'LL GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH FROM AN OIL BACK AROUND THROUGH Z IN A ALL THE WAY BACK TO L AND THEN THEY'LL TRY AND FINISH GOING BACKWARDS FROM L
GoZy_PICnGM_3 0 ONCE THEY'VE DONE ALL TWENTY SIX THE WORK BACKWARDS FROM ELF AS THAT'S AN INTERESTING WAY TO DO THAT
GoZy_PICnGM_4 0 NOW IT'S A GOOD PERFORMANCE GAME IT'S A GOOD WARMUP GAME BUT IT'S ALSO A GREAT GAME THAT YOU CAN PLAY IN THE CAR SO THAT YOU'RE PLAYING THESE GAMES AND KEEPING THE SKILLS CLOSE TO YOU
GoZy_PICnGM_5 0 YOU CANNOT GET AT ANY TIME OVER ANY CONVERSATION AND IT TENDS TO PULL A LITTLE SURPRISE INTO WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS THAT SMALL FILTER HAVING TO CHOOSE THE LETTER
GoZy_PICnGM_6 0 IT'S NOT LIKE THAT'S THE HARDEST TASK YOU'LL EVER DO AN IMPROV IS ASIAN BUT IT MIGHT CAUSE YOU TO MAKE A CHOICE THAT CENTER RESTING IN YOU STICK WITH
GoZy_PICnGM_7 0 IT'S A CHOICE DIFFERENT THAN YOU MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN IF YOU ARE PLAYING A GAME
GoZy_PICnGM_8 0 SO THOSE GAMES MIGHT BE A B C SCENES OR ALPHABET MONOLOGUE OR ALPHABET SCENE DIFFERENT GROUPS ARE GOING TO CALL THEM DIFFERENT THINGS BUT IT'S ALL THAT SAME BASIC SKILL
H7JNrI8IDMY_1 0 OKAY VOLLEY IT'S IT'S ONE OF THOSE UNDER PRACTICE SHOTS IN TENNIS
H7JNrI8IDMY_2 0 ALL OF OLLIE IS BECAUSE YOU'RE TAKING THE BALL BEFORE IT BOUNCES SO OBVIOUSLY THE BALL BOUNCES LIKE THIS THAT'S A GROUND STROKE
H7JNrI8IDMY_3 0 BUT IF THE BALL IS IN THE AIR AND YOU HIT IT THAT'S A VOLLEY
H7JNrI8IDMY_4 0 THERE'S TWO VOLLEYS THERE'S A FOREHAND VOLLEY IN THE BACKHAND
H7JNrI8IDMY_5 0 HERE'S A FOREHAND VOLLEY HERE IS THE BACKHAND VOLLEY
H7JNrI8IDMY_6 0 WE USE WHAT'S CALLED THE CONTINENTAL GRIP
H7JNrI8IDMY_7 0 SO IT'S LIKE A SHAKE HANDS GRIP THEN YOU JUST SLIGHTLY TURNED IT
H7JNrI8IDMY_8 0 AND YOU USE IT FOR BOTH SIDES
H7JNrI8IDMY_9 0 SO IF ANY OF YOUR EVER WATCHING THE PIRATE MOVIES THERE'S YOUR BACKHAND THERE'S YOUR FOREHAND
H7JNrI8IDMY_10 0 SO IT'S AS IF YOU WERE SWORD FIGHTING WITH SOMEBODY AND SINCE YOU ARE
H7JNrI8IDMY_11 0 INSTEAD OF HITTING EACH OTHER YOU'RE HITTING THE BALL
H7JNrI8IDMY_12 0 WHAT STEP OVER THE WALL AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO HIT THE FOREHAND VOLLEY
H7JNrI8IDMY_13 0 SO YOU TAKE THE BALL YOU TAKE YOUR RACKET YOU OPEN THE FACE AND YOU JUST BLOCK IT AGAINST THE WALL AND THAT'S A FOREHAND VOLLEY RIGHT THERE
H7JNrI8IDMY_14 0 AND THEN I CLICK OVER TO THE BACKHAND AND WE HIT A BACKHAND VOLLEY
H7JNrI8IDMY_15 0 AND THEN YOU CAN HIT YOU CAN HIT BOTH OF THEM
H7JNrI8IDMY_16 0 NOW THE WALL FORCES ME TO MOVE MY FEET
H7JNrI8IDMY_17 0 IF IT FORCES ME TO PREPARE MY RACKET SO YOU SEE I HIT THE BALL I CAN HAVE THE RACKET JUST DROP THAT
H7JNrI8IDMY_18 0 I'VE GOT TO HIT IT AND BE READY FOR THE NEXT ONE
H7JNrI8IDMY_19 0 HIT IT BE READY FOR THE NEXT ONE
H7JNrI8IDMY_20 0 SO THE VOLLEY IS VERY IMPORTANT STROKE AND IN THE NEXT SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO DEMONSTRATE HOW TO ACTUALLY USE IT IN A GAME SITUATION
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_1 0 SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE PUT THE TUNER COVERS ON THE GUITAR
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_2 0 IT'S A TRICKY PROCESS BECAUSE THEY DON'T SCREW ON BUT THEY NEED A FIRM PUSHING IT INTO PLACE
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_3 0 WELL WE ALREADY HAVE OUR TUNERS ON THE GUITAR
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_4 0 SO WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO GET OVER THIS TUNER AND THEN PUSH DOWN ON THIS TUNER COVER AND REALLY GET IN TO PLACE FIRM
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_5 0 BECAUSE THE FURNACE OF THIS TUNER COVER IS GOING TO DETERMINE HOW FIRM ARE TUNERS HOLDING THE POLICE WHICH IS GOING TO DETERMINE HOW FIRM OUR STRING IS HELD OF THE GUITAR WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_6 0 SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT WE DO
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_7 0 WE PUT IT DOWN INTO PLACE AND IT'S GOT A LOT OF A LOT OF FRICTION ON IT RIGHT THERE BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE IT TIGHT
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_8 0 YOU GET A PLASTIC PIECE THAT CAN FIT OVER IT SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO PUT A METAL WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE JAM AND IN THE PLACE
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_9 0 IT'S GOING TO GENTLY TAP IT DOWN AND I AM USING OUR PLASTIC PIECE AND GETTING ALL THE SIDES
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_10 0 AND IT
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_11 0 WE'VE ATTACHED OR TO RECOVER WE HAVEN'T AFFECTED THE WOOD IS LOOKING GOOD
guUkTXUwAAk_1 0 HI I'M TY BROWN WITH DOG BEHAVIOR ON LINE DOT COM TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO TRAIN A DOG
guUkTXUwAAk_2 0 THE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW IS HOW TO TRAIN A DOG TO GO SWIMMING
guUkTXUwAAk_3 0 NOW A LOT OF DOGS WILL NATURAL LIKE TO GO SWIMMING BUT A LOT OF DOGS NEED TO LEARN HOW TO BE TAUGHT
guUkTXUwAAk_4 0 THEY HAVE TO BE TAUGHT TO GO SWIMMING AND SO THERE'S A COUPLE KEY ASPECTS OF A COUPLE KEY POINTS OF HOW TO TEACH YOUR DOG TO GO SWIMMING
guUkTXUwAAk_5 0 NOW THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TEACH YOUR DOG WHERE THE ENTRIES AN EXIT STAR WHETHER IT BE A RIVER A POND STREAM OR A POOL THE DOG NEEDS TO KNOW HOW TO GET IN SAFELY AND HOW TO GET OUT SAFELY
guUkTXUwAAk_6 0 DOGS THAT STRUGGLE WITH SWIMMING OFTEN STRUGGLE BECAUSE THEY'RE NERVOUS ABOUT HOW TO THEY GET OUT AND SO THE FIRST THING TO DO IS SHOW THAT DOG HOW TO GET OUT OF A POOL HOW TO GET OUT OF THE STREAM OR WHEREVER HE IS THAT
guUkTXUwAAk_7 0 THE SECOND THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TRY TO USE MOTIVATION TO TEACH THAT DOG TO SWIM
guUkTXUwAAk_8 0 SO MAYBE IF THE DOG LOVES A BALL THROW A BALL UP INTO THE WATER
guUkTXUwAAk_9 0 SEE IF YOU'LL GO OUT THERE TO GET IT WHEN HE GOES OUT PRAISE HIM HEAVILY ALLOW HIM TO GET THAT BALL
guUkTXUwAAk_10 0 IF HE LOVES FOOD HAVE SOMEBODY OUT THERE IN THE WATER WITH SOME FOOD
guUkTXUwAAk_11 0 IF HE HAS A FAVORITE PERSON HAVE THAT PERSON GO OUT INTO THE WATER AND ENTICE THAT DOG TO COME IN
guUkTXUwAAk_12 0 WHATEVER IT IS TRY TO USE MOTIVATION
guUkTXUwAAk_13 0 NOW THERE ARE THOSE DOGS THAT THE NEED TO GO SWIMMING BUT DON'T REALLY HAVE MOTIVATION TO GET IN THE WATER AND SO FOR THOSE DOGS WE CAN USE A LEASH TO HELP OBLIGE THEM IN THE WATER AND AGAIN SHOW THEM HOW TO GET OUT
guUkTXUwAAk_14 0 NOW MOST DOGS IF YOU CAN SHOW THEM TIME AND TIME AGAIN HOW TO GET IN THE WATER HOW TO GET OUT AND THAT WHILE THEY'RE IN THERE IT'S A LOT OF FUN THEY'RE GOING TO EVENTUALLY LEARN TO ENJOY SWIMMING
guUkTXUwAAk_15 0 SO IN ORDER TO TEACH YOUR DOG WHERE THE EDGE AND IT'S EXITS IN ENTRIES ARE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS USE A LEASH AND USE A LEASH AS A TOOL FOR COMMUNICATION
guUkTXUwAAk_16 0 SO LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE THAT THIS LINE HERE IS THE WATER LINE NOW IF I WANT MY DOG TO GO IN ROCK LOCAL SWIMMING
guUkTXUwAAk_17 0 I GET HIM TO IN AND IMMEDIATELY GET THEM RIGHT BACK OUT
guUkTXUwAAk_18 0 SO THAT HE KNOWS WHERE THE ENTRY ISN'T WHERE THE EXIT ISN'T THAT HE KNOWS THAT YOU CAN HAVE VICTORY GETTING OUT LIKE THAT AND SO I WOULD DO THAT NUMEROUS TIMES IN ORDER FOR HIM TO START FEELING COMFORTABLE EACH TIME ALONG TO GO OUT FURTHER INTO WATER
guUkTXUwAAk_19 0 RUCKEL SWIMMING
guUkTXUwAAk_21 0 THE MONTH GOOD BOY
guUkTXUwAAk_22 0 GOOD BOY AND THAT'S HOW YOU TEACH YOUR DOG TO GO SWIMMING

GSSTK3BhSy8_1 0 IF THIS IS JEFF OF THE TWO WHEELER DEALER
GSSTK3BhSy8_2 0 TODAY I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO SELECT THE PROPER FENDERS FOR WHATEVER STYLE BIKE RIDE
GSSTK3BhSy8_3 0 NOW TO START OFF YOU'RE GOING TO PROBABLY NEED TO DETERMINE WHAT TIRE SIZE YOUR BIKE USES
GSSTK3BhSy8_4 0 IT SHOULD BE LABELED PRETTY CLEARLY ON THE SIDE WALL
GSSTK3BhSy8_5 0 TYPICAL SIZES BEING TWENTY SIX INCH AND A SEVEN HUNDRED SEE FOR TWENTY SIX INCH BIKES HAVE THE OPTION OF CLIP ON FENDERS SUCH AS THESE
GSSTK3BhSy8_6 0 THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS A FRONT FENDER THAT WILL MOUNT UP IS BASICALLY STICKING OFF IN FRONT OF THE IN FROM THE FRONT WHEEL
GSSTK3BhSy8_7 0 MOUNTING UP INTO THE STEER TUBE AND AND PROTECTING BACK BEHIND IT
GSSTK3BhSy8_8 0 AND IT CAN BE PAIRED WITH A REAR CLIP ON FENDER AS WELL
GSSTK3BhSy8_9 0 THIS ONE WILL JUST MOUNT AROUND YOUR SEAT TUBE AND AND A BASICALLY COVER BACK OVER THE REAR WHEEL
GSSTK3BhSy8_10 0 THESE ARE ABOUT TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS EACH
GSSTK3BhSy8_11 0 SO FOR A FULL SET ABOUT FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY DOLLARS
GSSTK3BhSy8_12 0 THE OTHER OPTION YOU'D HAVE WITH THE TWENTY SIX INCH WE'LL BIKE WOULD BE A FULL SET OFFENDERS
GSSTK3BhSy8_13 0 I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU THE MOST COVERAGE AND PROBABLY THE THE THE YOUR BEST BEST PROTECTION FROM YOUR WATER
GSSTK3BhSy8_14 0 THESE ONES ARE GOING TO BE SO GOOD FOR PROTECTING IS MUD BECAUSE THE CLEARANCE BETWEEN THE TIRE IN OFFENDERS MUCH TIGHTER
GSSTK3BhSy8_15 0 SO IF YOU ARE RIDING THROUGH VERY MUD MUDDY CONDITIONS IT MAY GET JAMMED UP BETWEEN THE FENDER IN THE TIRE
GSSTK3BhSy8_16 0 YOU MIGHT BE BEST OFF WITH THE CLIP ON STYLE
GSSTK3BhSy8_17 0 THESE RUN ABOUT FORTY FIVE DOLLARS
GSSTK3BhSy8_18 0 PRETTY COMFORTABLE IN PRICE TO THE CLIP ON THIS
GSSTK3BhSy8_19 0 BUT IF YOU'RE JUST RIDING IN THE WATER THESE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU THE BEST PROTECTION
GSSTK3BhSy8_20 0 FOR SEVEN HUNDRED SEE WE'LL BIKE LIKE A ROAD BIKE AND MAKE THE SAME FULL FENDER SETS
GSSTK3BhSy8_21 0 THESE ONES ARE JUST GOING TO COME IN A NARROWER ITS SIZE TO ACCOMMODATE THE NARROWER TIRE
GSSTK3BhSy8_22 0 SAME PRICE ABOUT FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY DOLLARS
GSSTK3BhSy8_23 0 THEY DON'T REALLY MAKE CLIP ON ONES FOR ROAD BIKES
GSSTK3BhSy8_24 0 THEY DO BUT THEY DON'T OFFER VERY MUCH COVERAGE
GSSTK3BhSy8_25 0 AND I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND GOING WITH A MORE OF A MORE OF A FULL FENDER SET THAN A CLIP ON A ROAD BIKE
GSSTK3BhSy8_26 0 THAT'S HOW TO SELECT PROPER FENDER SIZE FOR WHATEVER SIZE BIKE YOU RIDE

Ge0m7365dXk_4 0 TO CLEAN THE AQUARIUM PUT THAT INTO THE HOSE IN THE BUCKET DIP THE BELL OF THE SIPHON INTO THE WATER AND LIFT IT OUT BUT THE WATER DRAIN DOWN AND DROP IT BACK IN THIS WILL START THE SITE
Ge0m7365dXk_5 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS GO ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK SUCKING DEBRIS ON WITH THE GRAVEL
Ge0m7365dXk_6 0 THE SIPHON IS ONLY STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL THE DIRT UP OUT OF THE GRAVEL LEAVING THE GRAVEL IN PLACE
Ge0m7365dXk_7 0 THE GOAL IS TO GO OVER THE ENTIRE BOTTOM OF THE TANK BEFORE THE WATER LEVEL DRAINS MORE THAN A THIRD TO A HALF WAY
Ge0m7365dXk_8 0 AFTER THAT YOU WANT TO DEET DEET CHLORINATE THE TANK AND FILL IT BACK UP WITH FRESH WATER
Ge0m7365dXk_9 0 THE OTHER IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER WHEN DOING AQUARIUM MAINTENANCE IS TO EITHER RINSE OR REPLACE THE FILTER PADS IN YOUR MECHANICAL FILL

herI_Jrysfc_5 0 I FIND RIGHT NEAR THE END OF THE FINGERBOARD IS COMFORTABLE
herI_Jrysfc_6 0 IT'S A LITTLE TOO TIGHT DOWN THERE
herI_Jrysfc_7 0 AND JUST PULL ALL AND YOUR FINGER WILL COME TO REST ON THE NEXT STRING OVER

gZAGaEYOf4k_2 0 I'M JK DOOLEY AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SHE CLAYS TODAY AND IF YOU'RE A PHOTOGRAPHER ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT THIS PROCESS IS IT'S SOME FUN TO PRINT PHOTOGRAPHS ON CANVAS AND ALSO ON REALLY HIGH QUALITY WATERCOLOR PAPER
gZAGaEYOf4k_3 0 IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
gZAGaEYOf4k_4 0 SO IF YOU HAVE THE EQUIPMENT OR YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE PRINTER WHEN YOU'RE DOING YOUR SHE CLAY IS THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING IN AND YOU SHOULD ALREADY PRETTY PROBABLY HAVE A DIGITAL FILE BECAUSE YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE DIGITAL CAMERA MOST OF THE TIME BUT THIS WILL GIVE YOU AN IDEA
gZAGaEYOf4k_5 0 THESE ARE THIS IS A PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPER AND IF THIS IS AN IMAGE THAT I DID NOT A ALTERING ANYWAY
gZAGaEYOf4k_6 0 IT JUST CAME STRAIGHT OFF THE CAMERA AND THIS IS THE SAME IMAGE PRINTED ON SOME WATER COLOR PAPER AND THAT JUST KIND OF GIVES YOU AN IDEA
gZAGaEYOf4k_7 0 ANOTHER THE SETTINGS WE'RE CHANGED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE DIFFERENT LOOKS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND YOU CAN REALLY HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH SOME FOOT PHOTOGRAPHY AND I'VE SEEN PEOPLE TAKE FAMILY PORTRAITS
gZAGaEYOf4k_8 0 I'VE DONE SOME SCENERY SHOTS FOR PEOPLE AND AH BLOWN UP THE AVERAGE SIZE PHOTOGRAPH ONTO A THIRTY BY FORTY PIECE OF CANVAS AND ENHANCED IT AND IT LOOKS WONDERFUL
gZAGaEYOf4k_9 0 SO KEEP THAT IN MIND
gZAGaEYOf4k_10 0 THERE'S A LOT OF VERSATILITY TO THIS PROCESS AS WELL AND A LOT MORE WAYS FOR YOU TO PERHAPS SOME MAKE A FEW BORE FEW MORE DOLLARS
GPrp5X7LNWE_1 0 SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO LEARN THE TERM CARTOONING ROOM
GPrp5X7LNWE_2 0 AND JUST LIKE ONE FROM PART TWO PEOPLE TO BOOST I'M GOING TO MOVE MOVE FROM GOING AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO PUT IN THIS HAND COMES UP

g6g2uDg6Qgw_1 0 AS WE JUST DISCUSSED THE FOURTH NOTE OF A MAJOR SCALE AND THUS THE DISTANCE FROM THE FIRST NOTE OF A MAJOR SCALE TO THE FOURTH NOTE OF A MAJOR SCALE YOU WOULD REFER TO THAT INTERVAL AS A PERFECT FOURTH RATHER THAN A MAJOR FOURTH
g6g2uDg6Qgw_2 0 LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THAT ON THE GUITAR YOU START FROM THE G B TO THE SECOND NOTE OF THE MAJOR SCALE THIRD NOTE TO THE FOURTH NOTE
g6g2uDg6Qgw_3 0 THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE FIRST NOTE IN THE FOURTH NOTE WOULD BE CALLED A PERFECT FOURTH
g6g2uDg6Qgw_4 0 NOW NOTICE THAT THERE'S NO DIMINISHED FOURTH OR MINOR FOURTH BECAUSE THIS NOTE IS THE SAME AS THE THIRD NOTE OF THE MAJOR SCALE SINCE THERE'S ONLY A HALF STEP BETWEEN THE THIRD NOTE AND THE FOURTH NOTE OF A MAJOR SCALE
g6g2uDg6Qgw_5 0 IT ALMOST ALWAYS REFER TO THIS NOTE AS A THIRD AND ALMOST NEVER REFER TO IT AS A DIMINISHED FOR HALF
g6g2uDg6Qgw_6 0 SO INSTEAD WE JUST GOT ONE TWO THREE FOUR AND THEN WHEN YOU GET TO FIVE YOU HAVE THE DIMINISHED FIVE BUT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS INTERVAL SHAPE
g6g2uDg6Qgw_7 0 I'VE GOT DOWN ONE STRING SAME FRET
g6g2uDg6Qgw_8 0 AND IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE SHAPE FOR FOURTH PERFECT FOURTH EXCEPT FOR WHEN YOU GET TO THAT B STRING
g6g2uDg6Qgw_9 0 I'M GOING TO RAISE THAT BY ONE FRET
geseEurhJQ8_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LEFT HAND GRIP AND HOW MANY KNUCKLES YOU COULD SEE AT ADDRESS
geseEurhJQ8_2 0 THIS IS SAYING THAT THE NUMBER ONE IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD IS FOOD
geseEurhJQ8_3 0 NUMBER TWO IS WATER AND NUMBER THREE THE POSITION OF THE LEFT HAND GRIP
geseEurhJQ8_4 0 YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THE INFLUENCE OF THE LEFT HAND GRIP ON THE CLUB AND THIS IS WHY
geseEurhJQ8_5 0 BECAUSE SINCE YOUR WRITING YOUR RIGHT HAND RIGHT ARM IN RIGHT SIDE IS GOING TO DO SO MUCH
geseEurhJQ8_6 0 IT'S GOING TO DO SO MUCH YOUR RIGHT SIDE
geseEurhJQ8_7 0 YOUR LEFT SIDE YOUR WEAKER SIDE AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WEAKER IF YOUR ARE RIGHT HANDED TRY THROWING THE BALL LEFTY SEE HOW FAR IT GOES
geseEurhJQ8_8 0 IT'S A LOT WEAKER
geseEurhJQ8_9 0 YOU AT LEAST HAVE TO START OUT IN A POSITION WHERE ITS NATURAL AND THAT MIGHT BE IN THE SAME POSITION IS YOUR ARM HANGS
geseEurhJQ8_10 0 YOUR ON MY AND HANG LIKE THIS AND AS WE SEE FOUR KNUCKLES IT MIGHT HANG A LITTLE MORE LIKE THIS OR LIKE THIS
geseEurhJQ8_11 0 IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LEFT HAND GRIP HOLD THE CLUB SO THAT YOU SEE ONE KNUCKLE AND USE YOUR SWING
geseEurhJQ8_12 0 THEN HOLD THE CLUB WITH TWO KNUCKLES AND HIT
geseEurhJQ8_13 0 THEN WITH THREE KNUCKLES
geseEurhJQ8_14 0 THEN WITH FOUR KNUCKLES
geseEurhJQ8_15 0 YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE BALL GO IN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
geseEurhJQ8_16 0 EXPERIMENT WITH THAT LEFT HAND GRIP
geseEurhJQ8_17 0 THE LEFT HAND GRIP NEXT TO FOOD AND WATER IS POSSIBLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD
geseEurhJQ8_18 0 EXPERIMENT WITH THAT LEFT HAND GRIP
gHcCsvCSuI8_1 0 HI MY NAME'S JILL WEISS AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IS HOW TO THROW A SLOW PITCH SOFTBALL
gHcCsvCSuI8_2 0 FIRST THING YOU WANT TO CONSIDER IS JUST THE GRIP THE BALL
gHcCsvCSuI8_3 0 AND YOU KNOW MAYBE FIND THAT THE SEAMS AND THAT DEPENDING ON HOW BIG YOUR HANDS ARE OF YOU KNOW THE THUMB OF THE BALL OR THE THUMB ON ONE OF THE SEAMS AND THEN THE THREE AT LEAST THREE YOU KNOW OF YOUR FIRST FINGERS ON THE THE OUTSIDE OF THE SEAMS
gHcCsvCSuI8_4 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO PALM THE BALL
gHcCsvCSuI8_5 0 YOU WANT TO HAVE IT COMFORTABLY A KIND OF LOOSE AND THE THE ARC ON A SLOW PITCHES YOU KNOW THE SIX TO TEN FEET AND THE YOU KNOW THE OBJECT OF THE YOU KNOW SLOW PITCHES JUST YOU KNOW THE MAKING SURE THAT YOU PUT IT IN A POSITION WHERE THESE BATTERS YOU KNOW A EITHER YOU KNOW JUST GROUND OUT TO BE A POP IT UP OR CD YOU KNOW YOU STRIKE OUT
gHcCsvCSuI8_6 0 WHEN YOU'RE USING USING THAT OF FRONT FOOT TO PUSH OFF THE MOUND FROM THAT'S GOING TO HELP YOU OUT AND YOU KNOW WITH THE ART
gHcCsvCSuI8_7 0 AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR YOUR BODY BOTH YOUR HIPS EVEN WITH HOME PLATE AND FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE WITH THE HANDS
gHcCsvCSuI8_8 0 MY NAME'S JILL WEISS AND THOSE ARE JUST SOME TIPS ON HOW TO THROW AWAY SO SLIPPAGE SOFTBALL
GVL2P2xm04k_1 0 THE FIRST STEP TO DIRECTING LOCAL PASSION IS CREATING THE AGE GROUPS THAT YOU WANT TO DO
GVL2P2xm04k_2 0 NOW YOU CAN EITHER HAVE AN ASSORTMENT OF AGE GROUPS OR YOU CAN FOCUS ON ONE AGE GROUP THAT IS UP TO YOU AS A PAGEANT DIRECTOR
GVL2P2xm04k_3 0 IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO MULTIPLE AGE GROUPS YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER THE CATEGORIES OF THE AGE GROUPS
GVL2P2xm04k_4 0 AND I'M GOING TO HELP YOU BREAK THEM UP
GVL2P2xm04k_5 0 YOU CAN HAVE THEM ALL THE WAY FROM BABIES TO THE HIGH SCHOOL AGE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOCAL PAGEANT
GVL2P2xm04k_6 0 THIS IS EXCLUDING AT FRENCH FRIES WHEN YOU GET INTO THE COLLEGE AGE CONTESTANTS
GVL2P2xm04k_7 0 SOME EXAMPLES OF SOME EDGES BABY MISSES ZERO TO TWO YEARS OLD TIE NAME IS THREE TO FIVE YEARS OLD LITTLE MISS SIX TO EIGHT AND ON UP TO JUNIOR MINTS EIGHTEEN MINUTES AND MINUTES
GVL2P2xm04k_8 0 SO JUST CATEGORIZE THE AGES AS CLOSE TOGETHER AS YOU CAN SO THAT IT WILL BE MORE OF A FAIR COMPETITION TO ALL THE CONTESTANTS THE INNER
gNt29GDAGlc_1 0 I'M RICK TOBEY AND IN THIS SERIES WE'LL BE LEARNING HOW TO PLAY BLUES PROGRESSIONS AND A BLUES SONG ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gNt29GDAGlc_2 0 NOW WHAT WE'VE LEARNED SO FAR I WAS PLAYING ANY BLUES PROGRESSION WITH OPEN CHORDS IN HAVE AN A
gNt29GDAGlc_3 0 THESE ARE OPENED MEANING THAT THERE ARE OPEN STRINGS IN THE CHORD THERE
gNt29GDAGlc_4 0 OUR IS ALSO WAY TO PLAY WHERE THERE ARE NO OPEN STRINGS THESE WOULD ARE CALLED MOVABLE CHORDS OR A BAR CHORDS AND THE REASON IS THAT YOU CAN THEN CHANGE THE KEY
gNt29GDAGlc_5 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY A LITTLE RED RESTRAINT HE CAN PLAY AN OPENED
gNt29GDAGlc_6 0 THAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO PLAY A LITTLE RED ROOSTER IN A DIFFERENT TEA IT'S A D ON MY LEFT AND PLAY IT WITH THE BARRE CHORD
gNt29GDAGlc_7 0 SO THESE CHORDS ARE GOOD BECAUSE YOU CAN PLAY ANY SONG IN A KEY
gNt29GDAGlc_8 0 AND THEN THE NEXT LESSON WILL OR A PLACE THESE SPECIFIC CHORD C E THE A AND B SEVENTH AS A MOVABLE OR BARRE CHORD
hK0nsZ0vWX0_1 0 SO GOING OVER A STRAINER AND DEALING WITH STRAIN IS WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR BOAT IS A VERY DANGEROUS THING TO DO
hK0nsZ0vWX0_2 0 AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE DEMONSTRATING IT TODAY
hK0nsZ0vWX0_3 0 HOWEVER WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING A LITTLE BIT OF EVERY ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT IF UNFORTUNATELY YOU DO COME UP IN THAT SITUATION
hK0nsZ0vWX0_4 0 STRAIN IS A WIND TREES OF PULLING INTO THE RIVER AND YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF WATER GOING PASTA
hK0nsZ0vWX0_5 0 JUST LIKE SOMETHING YOU'RE GOING TO STRAIN OUT PASTA WITH THE LAW JOBS THAT OBJECTS GET STUCK ON THE WALL TO FLOWS THROUGH
hK0nsZ0vWX0_6 0 THIS IS WHY THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS THING WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR BOAT
hK0nsZ0vWX0_7 0 FIRST THING THAT YOU SHOULD TRY AND DO IS SWIMMERS AGGRESSIVELY IS YOU CAN AROUND THE STRING UP TO AVOID IT FIRST AND FOREMOST
hK0nsZ0vWX0_8 0 HOWEVER IF YOU COME TO AVOID THAT THEN YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT SEEMS A LITTLE STRANGE
hK0nsZ0vWX0_9 0 GET ON YOUR BELLY AND SWIM AS AGGRESSIVELY AS YOU CAN TOWARDS A STRAINER
hK0nsZ0vWX0_10 0 WHICH POINT WHEN YOU GET CLOSE TO IT REACH UP GRAB THE STRING ON A WHOLE YOURSELF OVER SO THE STRING IS ON THE WHEEL WAIST
hK0nsZ0vWX0_11 0 AT THIS POINT WHEN YOU'VE GOT MOST OF YOUR CHEST OVER THE TREE YOU DON'T WANT TO KICK OVER IT AND TRYING TO GET PASTA
hK0nsZ0vWX0_12 0 OR IF YOU'RE STABLE SIT AND WAIT FOR MORE SYSTEMS
hK0nsZ0vWX0_13 0 WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T GO ON TO THE STRAINER AND DON'T PUSH PEOPLE DOWN IF THEY CALL ON A STRAINER BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LIMBS THE STICKING BELOW THE SURFACE TO CATCH SOMEONE
HGTvZMJFiFc_1 0 I'M BEAU TIMKEN MASTER SAKE SOME WAY
HGTvZMJFiFc_2 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DIE GINJO SAKE BUT MORE PARTICULAR I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW THIS BOTTLE GETS FROM SHE'S OKA PREFECTURE TO YOU WHERE YOU LIVE WHEREVER YOU MIGHT BE
HGTvZMJFiFc_3 0 IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING JOURNEY
HGTvZMJFiFc_4 0 A BREWER WILL FOR MEN SAKE FOR THIRTY TO SIXTY TO START THIRTY TO FORTY DAYS
HGTvZMJFiFc_5 0 AND THEN WHAT THEY'LL DO IS THEY'LL ALLOWED TO REST TO SIT FROM SIX MONTHS TO ABOUT A YEAR
HGTvZMJFiFc_6 0 THIS IS WHERE IT'S EXCITING
HGTvZMJFiFc_7 0 ONCE THE PASTEURIZE IT FOR THE FINAL TIME THE PACKAGE OF THE BOTTLE IT IN THE SHAPE IT OUT
HGTvZMJFiFc_8 0 ON THE DATE ON EACH BOTTLE YOU'LL HAVE A BOTTLING DATE
HGTvZMJFiFc_9 0 SO WHAT HAPPENS THEN IS MOST OF THE BREWS GO TO YOUR COMIC PREFECTURE WITH A MAJOR SHIPPING AREAS
HGTvZMJFiFc_10 0 AND THEY GET LOADED ON A CARGO SHIP AND THE SHIP GOES FOR THIRTY DAYS ACROSS THE OCEAN AND ENDS UP IN EITHER A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR POKEMON CALIFORNIA OR AND I WOULD SAY THAT'S ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF ALL SAKES IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES IT'S AND UP THERE OR THEY TAKE THE LONG BOAT CHINA AND THEY GO OUT TO THE PANAMA CANAL UP TO THE EAST COAST TO NEW JERSEY
HGTvZMJFiFc_11 0 SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY DAYS TRAVELING AUNTS HEIGHT SEEDS
HGTvZMJFiFc_12 0 THEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT QUARANTINE REALLY GOING TO SHIPPING IN

GmZ1X1PsgDE_1 0 SO YOU GUYS IN TODAY'S TOPIC WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW A DJ MIXER WORKS
GmZ1X1PsgDE_2 0 LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS
GmZ1X1PsgDE_3 0 YOUR BASIC DJ MIXER YOU USUALLY GET TWO CHANNELS LEFT AND RIGHT
GmZ1X1PsgDE_4 0 AND THOSE ARE REALLY BASICALLY YOUR LEFT AND RIGHT SOURCES IN THIS CASE TWO TURNTABLES
GmZ1X1PsgDE_5 0 AND THEN YOU'VE GOT A SELECTOR SWITCH FOR YOUR CUE OR FOR YOUR HEADPHONES
GmZ1X1PsgDE_6 0 THAT'S GOING TO CUE YOUR HEADPHONES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
GmZ1X1PsgDE_7 0 AND BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS ALL THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AS YOU DJ IS THE DJ'S BASICALLY ONE STEP THE HEAD OF THE CROWD AND BASICALLY IN THE HEAD PHOTOS CAMERA WRAP THE NEXT OUT BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY BRINGS IT IN AND TURNS THE VOLUME UP IN HERE
GmZ1X1PsgDE_8 0 LET'S GET FAMILIAR WITH THE PARTS OF A DJ MIXER
GmZ1X1PsgDE_9 0 AND ANY DJ MIXER YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A GILLAM WHICH IS TO SAY THE VOLUME COMING INTO THE MIXER FROM THE TURNTABLES
GmZ1X1PsgDE_10 0 YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE A SECTION OF EQUALIZER LOW FREQUENCY NEED FREQUENCY IN HIGH FREQUENCY
GmZ1X1PsgDE_11 0 AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A VOLUME FADER WHICH CONTROLS THE VOLUME THAT GOES OUT TO THE HOUSE AND THE HOUSE IS BASICALLY WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS LISTENING TO
GmZ1X1PsgDE_12 0 THERE'S ALSO ON MOST DJ MIXER IS THAT A BASIC CROSS FADER WHICH FADES BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE LEFT SOUND SOURCE AND RIGHT SOUNDS WORKS
GmZ1X1PsgDE_13 0 AND YOU'VE GOT A MASTER VOLUME AND THAT MASTER VOLUME IS YOUR VOLUME FOR THE HOUSE
GmZ1X1PsgDE_14 0 THAT'S THE BASIC PAINTINGS
hbQigJ5VmFg_1 0 IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TOUCH THEM
hbQigJ5VmFg_2 0 NOW SAY YOU'VE WRITTEN IN YOUR AUTOMATION VIA DRAWING OR THE FADER MOVEMENT AND YOU'VE DONE THAT VIEW OF USING THE RIGHT MODE
hbQigJ5VmFg_3 0 NOW TO TOUCH MOTOR INSTEAD OF HAVING TO START ALL OVER WITH THE RIGHT AND START AT THE BEGINNING AND REDO EVERY AUTOMATION POINT YOU CAN TAKE TOUCH AND START WHEREVER YOU LIKE
hbQigJ5VmFg_4 0 START FROM THE BEGINNING MIDDLE OR THE END AND WHENEVER YOU TOUCH AND MOVE THE FADER THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE WHATEVER AUTOMATION YOU'VE ALREADY HAD RIGHT
hbQigJ5VmFg_5 0 SO SAY YOU STOP USING TOUCH MODE YOU JUST MOVE IT TO FIX ONE LITTLE PART IT WILL CONTINUE ON READING WHAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN IN THE AUTOMATION
hbQigJ5VmFg_6 0 SO THEREFORE IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE TWO SECONDS WITHIN THIRTY SECONDS YOU CAN DO THAT WITH TOUCH MODE
hbQigJ5VmFg_7 0 IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO JUST TAG ON CHANGE SOMETHING AND IT WILL GO RIGHT BACK TO WHERE IT WAS

h1UXt3b8nC4_1 0 THE TRADITIONAL RIP IS TO GO THROUGH FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE MAJORING EDUCATION AND WHEN YOU COME OUT YOU CAN TAKE SOME TESTING OR CERTIFIED TEACHER
h1UXt3b8nC4_2 0 BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF ALTERNATE CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE NATION THAT TAKE ANYWHERE FROM TWELVE MONTHS TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS WHERE SOMEONE WHO HAS A COLLEGE DEGREE CAN GO AND GET THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THEY NEED TO BECOME A CERTIFIED TEACHER
h1UXt3b8nC4_3 0 WELL THE ONE I NOW ABOUT IS REGION FOR IN HOUSTON I STAY IN HOUSTON TEXAS
h1UXt3b8nC4_4 0 AND IT'S AN EIGHTEEN MONTHS PROGRAM THREE UNIVERSITY OF ST_THOMAS AND YOU TAKE GRADUATE LEVEL COURSES THAT SEEM TO BE PRIMARILY IN ELEMENTARY AGED STUDENTS IN READING
h1UXt3b8nC4_5 0 AND THERE ARE A LOT OF ADDITIONAL CLASSES ON CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT
h1UXt3b8nC4_6 0 AT THE END OF THAT EIGHTEEN MONTHS INCLUDING A YEAR WORKING IN THE CLASSROOM ARE GIVEN A FULL TEACHER CERTIFICATION
h1UXt3b8nC4_7 0 I DON'T KNOW IF THEY STILL DO THAT BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE NOTE CHILD LEFT BEHIND REQUIREMENTS
h1UXt3b8nC4_8 0 I DIDN'T GET THE TRADITIONAL AND TAKE ALL THE EDUCATION CLASSES THEY THINK ARE NECESSARY
h1UXt3b8nC4_9 0 I WOULD SAY IF YOU'RE AWARE OF WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU IN CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT AND WHAT WAS EFFECTIVE AND WHAT WAS NOT AFFECT IF THAT IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN AND BEING ABLE TO CONTROL THE ATMOSPHERE OF YOUR CLASS OR WHEN YOU BECOME A TEACHER
h1UXt3b8nC4_10 0 IF YOU KNOW WHAT WORKS FOR YOU AND YOU CAN SPECULATE AS TO WHAT WOULD WORK FOR OTHERS
h1UXt3b8nC4_11 0 I WAS A JOURNALIST BEFORE AND THE STUDENT SCENE COMPLETELY ENAMORED WITH THE IDEA THAT MY NAME IS IN PRINT AND PICTURES I'VE TAKEN OUR IN PAPERS
h1UXt3b8nC4_12 0 BUT I THINK ANYTHING YOU DO OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM YOU CAN BRING INTO THE CLASSROOM AND SOMEWHERE ANOTHER BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WE'RE TAPE THAT WE'RE TEACHING THE BASICS OF LIFE EVERYDAY IN THE ELEMENTARY H STUDENT
h1UXt3b8nC4_13 0 I THINK YOU NEED TO HAVE EFFECT OF COMMUNICATION SCALES
h1UXt3b8nC4_14 0 YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH CHILDREN IN PARENTS ALIKE
h1UXt3b8nC4_15 0 YOU NEED TO LIKE CHILDREN AND THEY'RE ELEMENTARY TEACHERS WHO DO NOT AND THEY SHOULD MOVE ON
h1UXt3b8nC4_16 0 YOU HAVE IMAGINATION AND CREATIVITY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE GETTING ALL THE RESOURCES YOU NEED TO DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
h1UXt3b8nC4_17 0 AND YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN
h1UXt3b8nC4_18 0 SO IF THEY DON'T HAVE AN EIGHTH OF THE TIPS YOU MIGHT BE USING DRY BEANS AND THOSE ARE MANIPULATIVE THAT'S FINE
h1UXt3b8nC4_19 0 SO YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A CURRICULUM AND MAKE IT REAL IN THE EYES THAT IN A YEAR OLD
h1UXt3b8nC4_20 0 THEY'RE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADVANCEMENT FROM HERE
h1UXt3b8nC4_21 0 I'LL PROBABLY STATE CLASSIC TEACHER FOR THE REST NOT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO

gn4P8HdK_Ps_2 0 YOU WANT TO SLITS AND WE'VE ONE SIDE OF THE SCARF BEFORE YOU DO THE OTHER SIDE SO THAT YOUR HOLES DON'T SHIFT WHILE YOU'RE WORKING ON ANOTHER SIDE
gn4P8HdK_Ps_3 0 I PREFER WHEN I START MY WEAVING I LIKE TO START IN THE MIDDLE BECAUSE THE STRIP IS SO LONG IT'LL BE A LITTLE BIT SHORTER IF WE START IN THE MIDDLE AND GO FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER END
gn4P8HdK_Ps_4 0 OKAY SO YOU FIND YOUR MIDDLE SLIT
gn4P8HdK_Ps_5 0 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXACTLY THE MIDDLE SLIP
gn4P8HdK_Ps_6 0 AND JUST YOU CAN POKE IT THROUGH WITH THE BLUNT INTO THE SCISSORS AND PULL THAT OUT TO ABOUT HALF WAY BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN JUST WEAVE IT IN AND OUT OF YOUR SLITS POKING POKING THROUGH THE HOLES

gn4P8HdK_Ps_10 0 AND JUST CONTINUE THIS ALL THE WAY DOWN THE END OF THE SCARF
gn4P8HdK_Ps_11 0 I'VE FINISHED SLITTING AND WEAVING BOTH SIDES OF MY SCARF
gn4P8HdK_Ps_12 0 IF YOU FIND THAT YOUR SCARF IS A LITTLE PUCKERING YOU MAY WANT TO JUST ADJUST THE COORDINATING FABRIC

H6DHOeeDBdY_3 0 NOW WE'VE HAD SOME PROBLEMS LINING UP THE PHOTOGRAPHS AS THEY WERE TAKEN THE ORIGINALLY IN POSER
H6DHOeeDBdY_4 0 SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS I'VE TAKEN THE PHOTOGRAPHS BACK INTO PHOTO SHOP AND I'VE DONE A SIMPLE LINE UP USING THE GRID IT'S IN PHOTO SHOP
H6DHOeeDBdY_5 0 AND TO DO THAT I'VE ISOLATED EACH FACE AND PUT THEM ON DIFFERENT LAYERS SO THAT WHEN THE TOP LAYER IS THE FRONT VIEW AND THE BOTTOM LAYER IS THE SIDE VIEW
H6DHOeeDBdY_6 0 AND THEN IT'S JUST A MATTER OF LINING UP THE EYES AND THE MOUTH AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE
H6DHOeeDBdY_7 0 AND I COULD PROBABLY EVEN DO SOME SCALING OF ONE OF THESE PHOTOGRAPHS TO MAKE THEM LINED UP EVEN MORE
H6DHOeeDBdY_8 0 BUT ONCE THAT'S DONE THEN I EXPORT EACH IMAGE EACH LAYER SEPARATELY AS A SEPARATE IMAGE AND IT'S J PICK FILE
H6DHOeeDBdY_9 0 NOW YOU'LL NOTICE THAT OFF TO THE SIDES HERE WE HAVE QUITE A BIT OF WHITE SPACE AND OF COURSE WE HAVE A GREEN BACKGROUND
H6DHOeeDBdY_10 0 NOW WE CAN KNOCK OUT THE GREEN BACKGROUND IN PHOTO SHOP OR ANOTHER PROGRAM BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH THIS WHITE SPACES WE HAVE TO PAINT AROUND THE IMAGE SO THAT WE HAVE THIS BLEND INTO A SKIN TONE
H6DHOeeDBdY_11 0 FOR INSTANCE IF I WERE TO SELECT THE PAINT BRUSH AND THE EYEDROPPER TOOL I PROBABLY WANT TO TAKE A SKIN TONE SOMEWHERE IN THERE AND THEN ADD A NEW LAYER AND PERHAPS BEGIN PAINTING LIKE THIS

GIzqSW-MQrQ_4 0 THE SEEDS IF THEY'RE EASY OBSERVE THE WEATHER AND YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OF THE REINS AND THE SEEDS AFTER YOU PLAN ON IT SHOULD COME UP TO THREE TO FOUR DAYS AFTER YOU PLAN ON AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO COORDINATE IT WITH THE WEATHER SAYS THAT THING OF RAIN GEAR SOAK THEM IN AND AND THEY CAN HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF OF A STRONG GERMINATION

gsbBRXcJhTA_1 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO SKATE BOARD THE FIRST THING I NEED TO LEARN IS HOW TO PUSH

h1_N7_-FQuk_9 0 IF I SELECT THIS I HAVE THE OPTION OF USING EITHER NO FILTER A YELLOW FILTER AN ORANGE FILTER A RED FILTER OR A GREEN FILTER
h1_N7_-FQuk_10 0 AND THAT THIS BASICALLY SELECTING ONE OF THESE HAS THE SAME EFFECT AS ACTUALLY PUTTING A FILTER THAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY SCREW ON TO THE FRONT OF YOUR LENS
h1_N7_-FQuk_11 0 THE CAMERA WILL AUTOMATICALLY MAKE THAT ADJUSTMENT
h1_N7_-FQuk_12 0 IF YOU USE A YELLOW FILTER THE BLUE SKY WILL LOOK MORE NATURAL AND THE WHITE CLOUDS WILL LOOK A LITTLE BIT CRISPER
h1_N7_-FQuk_13 0 IF YOU USE AN ORANGE FILTER AT THE BLUE SQUAT THE BLUE SKY WILL LOOK A LITTLE BIT DARKER AND THE SUNSET WILL LOOK A LITTLE BIT MORE BRILLIANT
h1_N7_-FQuk_14 0 IF YOU LEAVE USE A RED FILTER THE BLUE SKY WILL USUALLY IT LOOK A LITTLE BIT DARKER AND THAT LEAVES WILL LOOK A LITTLE BIT CRISPER AND BRIGHTER
h1_N7_-FQuk_15 0 AND THEN THAT IF YOU USE THE GREEN A FILTER EFFECT SKIN TONES AND LIPS WILL LOOK REALLY GOOD BECAUSE THEY'RE RED AND AND THE GREEN IS THE OPPOSITE OF RED SO IT MAKES THOSE STICK OUT A LITTLE DARKER A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTRAST AND THEN THAT TREE LEAVES AND STUFF LIKE THAT WILL LOOK AT BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME COLOR IS GREEN
h1_N7_-FQuk_16 0 SO IF YOU WANTED TO YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND SELECT LET'S SAY RED BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SHOOTING SOME BLACK AND WHITE PORTRAITS OF PEOPLE WITH SAY THEY HAD SOME LIPSTICK ON
h1_N7_-FQuk_17 0 LET'S ACTUALLY SELECT GREEN AND THAT'LL MAKE THEIR LIPS AND THE SKIN LOOK REALLY CONTRASTY SO GO AHEAD AND SELECT THAT FOR THE FILTER EFFECT
h1_N7_-FQuk_18 0 AND THEN I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND HIT MENU HERE BACK TO THE PICTURE STYLE
h1_N7_-FQuk_19 0 SO YOU'VE SELECTED MONOCHROME AND WE'VE GONE IN THERE AND AND PICKED UP A FILTER AND THAT SHOULD APPLY THE FILTER TO OUR SETTINGS

GhhzAPFwzas_3 0 NOW THIS SUBJECT I REALLY I'M VERY INTERESTED IN BECAUSE I FOUND MOST OF THE PLANTS IN THE WORLD HAVE BEEN CLONED
GhhzAPFwzas_4 0 AND IT'S FASCINATING TO ME THE WHOLE PROCESS AND HOW IT WORKS
GhhzAPFwzas_5 0 BUT IT'S VERY SIMPLE
GhhzAPFwzas_6 0 PLANTER A SEXUAL THAT MEANS THAT THEY HAVE ALL THE GENETICS WITH AN THEMSELVES
GhhzAPFwzas_7 0 THEY DON'T NEED A BOY INTEGRAL PLANT TO MAKE BABIES
GhhzAPFwzas_8 0 AND IT'S REALLY EASY TO SEE THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT A LILY BULB
GhhzAPFwzas_9 0 A LILY BULB CLOWNS ITSELF
GhhzAPFwzas_10 0 SO TO EACH LITTLE CLOVES JUST LIKE A GARLIC WILL MAKE ITS OWN PLANT
GhhzAPFwzas_11 0 SO WHEN THERE'S A NEW VARIETY A LILY COMES OUT THAT A SPECIAL OR EXCITING OR ONE THAT THEY WANT TO REPRODUCE THEY CLONE IT BY JUST SEPARATING IT INTO LITTLE PIECES
GhhzAPFwzas_12 0 AND THAT WAY THEY'LL START THIRTY FORTY NEW PLANTS FROM ONE
GhhzAPFwzas_13 0 AND IT'LL BE A IDENTICALLY GENETIC TO THE MOTHER PLANT
GhhzAPFwzas_14 0 AND THAT WAY IF YOU HAVE A NEW BREED OF COLOR THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING ARE WORTH A LOT OF MONEY YOU CAN CLOSE IT VERY EASILY
GhhzAPFwzas_16 0 THEY'RE ALSO CLONING THROUGH TISSUE CULTURE NOW TOO
GhhzAPFwzas_17 0 SO ALL YOU NEED IS ONE SELL
GhhzAPFwzas_18 0 EVERY LITTLE CELL JUST A FINGERNAIL SCRATCHING OF THAT PLANT HAS ALL THE DIFFERENT MAKEUP FOR IT
GhhzAPFwzas_19 0 AND THEY CAN CLONE FROM THAT ONE LITTLE SAMPLE THROUGH TISSUE CULTURE
GhhzAPFwzas_20 0 AND THEY JUST LET IT TO GROW INTO A BOWL BLITZ AND THEN IT GROWS INTO A BULB FROM ONE LITTLE SELL
GhhzAPFwzas_21 0 IT'S AMAZING TO ME
GhhzAPFwzas_22 0 SO PLANTS CAN ALSO CLONE THEMSELVES BY ROOTS
GhhzAPFwzas_23 0 SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THE MOTHER PLANT JUST MAKES MORE ROOTS AND MAKES THE BABY
GhhzAPFwzas_24 0 SO THE BABY IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE MOTHER AND THERE'S NO GENETIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO
GhhzAPFwzas_25 0 AND THAT'S EASY WAY FOR GRASS FOR EXAMPLE THIS FLAX TO MULTIPLY
GhhzAPFwzas_26 0 THEY ALSO PRODUCE SEATS AND SEEDS ARE MIXED WITH OTHER TYPES OF GRASS IS AND THEY CAN BE DIFFERENT GENETICALLY
GhhzAPFwzas_27 0 THE CLOSER NEVER DIFFERENT GENETICALLY THAN THE MOTHER PLANT
GhhzAPFwzas_28 0 ANOTHER WAY THAT PLANTS CLONE THEMSELVES IS THROUGH RUNNERS
GhhzAPFwzas_29 0 SO A LILAC WILL HAVE DIFFERENT SHOOTS COMING OUT THE BOTTOM AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY PULL THAT SHOOT UP AND THAT'S BASICALLY THE CLONE OF ITS MOTHER IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN THE MOTHER
GhhzAPFwzas_30 0 AND PLANTS LIKE THIS GERANIUM YOU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE ROOT CUTTINGS YOU CAN TAKE STEM CUTTINGS AND IT'LL MAKE ITS OWN PLANT
GhhzAPFwzas_31 0 AND THOSE ARE CLOSER EXACTLY REPRODUCTION OF THE MOTHER PLANTS
GhhzAPFwzas_32 0 AND THE EASIEST WAY THAT I HAVE FOUND TO CLONE PLANTS ARE TO TAKE GROUP CUTTINGS IS JUST TAKE BASIC HONEY AND PUT IT INTO A STRAIGHT SHOT JAR ARE STRAIGHT SHOT GLASS IT MAKES IT REALLY EASY AND YOU DON'T USE A LOT THAT WAY
GhhzAPFwzas_33 0 AND WHEN YOU'RE TAKING A STEM YOU GO TO WEAR TO STARTS NEEDS
GhhzAPFwzas_34 0 SO AT THIS POINT AS LONG AS THEY BREAK IT AWAY FROM THE STEM
GhhzAPFwzas_35 0 AND I ALWAYS TRY TO DO IT WERE THE NEXT LEAF IS IN THAT WAY IT WILL FILL IN TOGETHER ALL TOGETHER
GhhzAPFwzas_36 0 SO BY JUST TAKING A CUTTING
GhhzAPFwzas_37 0 YOU CAN TEAR IT OFF OR CUT IT OFF IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER I'VE FOUND CAUSE THEY'LL GROW ROOTS
GhhzAPFwzas_38 0 A LOT OF TIMES SAY TO CUT AT AN ANGLE BUT I FOUND WAVING LEAVING IT A LITTLE BIT OF A SHRED IT'LL ROOT EVEN BETTER
GhhzAPFwzas_39 0 SO THE EASIEST WAY TO START IN YOUR GERANIUM AND I DON'T HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT EVEN DIP IT INTO HONEY JUST PUT IT RIGHT INTO THE SOIL
GhhzAPFwzas_40 0 JUST DIP IT A LITTLE BIT OF HONEY
GhhzAPFwzas_41 0 AND THE HONEY ACTUALLY ACTS LIKE THIS THAT ENERGY TO BECAUSE OF THE SUGAR
GhhzAPFwzas_42 0 SO IT SEEMS TO BOND AND THAT WAY THE ROOTS AND TO GROW BETTER
GhhzAPFwzas_43 0 YOU JUST PUT IT MAYBE ONE TO TWO INCHES ONE TO TWO INCHES IN THE GROUND
GhhzAPFwzas_44 0 AND IT ALSO HELPS TO CUT SOME OF THE BOTTOM LEAVES OFF SO THAT JUST THE TOP LEAVES ARE LEFT
GhhzAPFwzas_45 0 AND THAT WAY THEY SEEM TO GROW BETTER BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT MORE ENERGY TO PUT TO THE TOP LEAVES
GhhzAPFwzas_46 0 AND IF YOU KEEP CHECKING ON IT I'VE FOUND YOUR GERANIUMS WILL GROW QUITE QUICKLY AND WITHIN A MONTH WILL HAVE A WHOLE ANOTHER PLANT
HifGtv6bniQ_1 0 RICK GEISSLER EXPERT VILLAGE <UNK> COMING TO YOU FROM <UNK> TIRE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO BUY TIRES

gitlNe_51ho_7 0 ONE MORE COMMON THINGS AS THEY LET THE RIGHT HAND OPEN UP TOO MUCH SO THAT THEY'RE LIKE THIS TRYING TO USE THEIR ARMS AND SHOULDERS TOO MUCH
gitlNe_51ho_8 0 SO WHY A GOOD GRIP MATTERS
gitlNe_51ho_9 0 IT'S VERY FEW GREAT PLAYERS THAT HAVE BED GRIPS BECAUSE THE GRIP IS LIKE THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE CLUB IS CONNECTED TO THE BODY THAT'S HOW THE BODY IS CONNECTED TO THE CLUB

g-Sodm6JsUo_1 0 WHEN IT COMES TO BRAIDING HAIR IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF STABILIZER
g-Sodm6JsUo_2 0 I DO NOT RECOMMEND MOVES
g-Sodm6JsUo_3 0 THEY TEND TO FLAKE AND THEY DON'T HAVE A STRONG ENOUGH HOLD
g-Sodm6JsUo_4 0 GEL IS GREAT TO USE WHILE YOU WORK BUT AFTER THE HAIR STYLES BEEN COMPLETED IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF HAIRSPRAY
g-Sodm6JsUo_5 0 WHAT I HAVE HERE IS A GIOVANNI HAIRSPRAYED THAT'S MAXIMUM STRENGTH HOLE BUT IT'S PURE ORGANIC TECHNOLOGY
g-Sodm6JsUo_6 0 NOW WHEN YOU FINISH A HAIRSTYLE IS GREAT TO JUST TAKE THIS BRAID AND SPRAY IT OVER THE ENTIRE HEAD JUST AGAIN MAKE SURE ALL THE LITTLE STRAY HAIRS STAY BACK
g-Sodm6JsUo_7 0 BECAUSE THE BRAID YOU'RE GOING TO BE WORN FOR DECENT AMOUNT OF TIME AND YOU WANT THE QUALITY OF THE STYLE TO LAST AS LONG AS IT CAN
g-Sodm6JsUo_8 0 NOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL BRAVE JUST SPRAY RIGHT ALONG DOWN THE BRAID AND THEN RUB IT DOWN JUST TO TRY TO GET THOSE LITTLE STRAY HAIRS
g-Sodm6JsUo_9 0 I LIKE TO SQUEEZE IT DOWN AS THAT ARE RUBBING TOO HARD BECAUSE THAT CAN MAKE THE PROBLEM JUST A LITTLE BIT WORSE

HFpzop3y4H4_1 0 HI I'M TY BROWN WITH DOG BEHAVIOR ONLINE DIE
HFpzop3y4H4_2 0 PALM I'M HERE IN RIVERTON UTAH TODAY TEACHING YOU HOW TO TRAIN A DOG
HFpzop3y4H4_3 0 THE TOPIC OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION IS TEACHING YOUR DOG HOW TO USE A DOG YOU DOOR
HFpzop3y4H4_4 0 NOW A LOT OF DOGS ARE A LITTLE BIT THREATEN BY THE CONCEPT OF A DOG YOUR DOOR BECAUSE ON FIRST GLANCE IT LOOKS LIKE JUST ANOTHER PART OF THE WALL AND SO TO TEACH YOUR DOG TO RUN INTO THAT PART OF THE WALL AND GO THROUGH IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT DAUNTING AND SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS SET YOUR SET YOURSELF UP AND SET YOUR DOG UP FOR SUCCESS
HFpzop3y4H4_5 0 IN THE BEGINNING STAGES HAVE YOUR DOG WHERE A LEASH APPROACH THE DOOR AND GIVE THEM A COMMAND SUCH AS GO THROUGH OR GO POTTY OR SOME OTHER COMMAND LIKE THAT SO THAT THE DOG IS CUBES TO DO SOMETHING
HFpzop3y4H4_6 0 ONCE YOU SET THAT USE THE LEASH TO IMPEL HIM THROUGH THE DOOR
HFpzop3y4H4_7 0 IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO JUST CONTINUE HELPING HIM
HFpzop3y4H4_8 0 IF YOU REALLY DOESN'T WANT TO GO GET A PARTNER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR TO HELP YOU
HFpzop3y4H4_9 0 PULL THE LEASH THROUGH AND HAVE THE PARTNER KIND OF GIVE A COUPLE TUG SO THAT THE DOG COMES THROUGH
HFpzop3y4H4_10 0 ONCE HE MAKES IT THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE AT THAT POINT IT'S VERY CRITICAL THAT YOU REALLY MAKING FEEL GOOD ABOUT HIS VICTORY
HFpzop3y4H4_11 0 GIVE THEM A TREAT GIVE HIM SOME PRAISE HELP THEM FEEL REALLY GOOD THAT YOU MADE IS WAY THROUGH THE DOOR
HFpzop3y4H4_12 0 NOW IF YOU DO THIS WITH A LOT OF REPETITIONS THE DOG ASSUME GOING TO LEARN ALL THAT DOGGY DOORS AND SO FEARFUL THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT AND HE'S GOING TO GO THROUGH ON IS ON
HFpzop3y4H4_13 0 BUT UNTIL YOU GET THEM TO THAT POINT YOU'VE GOT TO DO A LOT OF HELPING AND A LOT OF SHOWING SO THAT THE DOG CAN MAKE THE DECISION ON IS ON AND THAT'S HOW YOU TRAIN A DOG HOW TO USE THE DOG THE DOOR
gC60UjILVDU_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT I JUST WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT ANGLING THE SOFT BOX
gC60UjILVDU_2 0 A LOT OF TIMES A I TEND TO USE MY SOFT BOX PRETTY WELL PARALLEL TO THE SUBJECT
gC60UjILVDU_3 0 BUT YOU COMPLETE INTO AND THEN USE YOU CAN SEE THE ILLUMINATES THE BACKGROUND A LITTLE BIT MORE
gC60UjILVDU_4 0 BUT ALSO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTRAST ON ONE SIDE OF THE OF THE SUBJECT
gC60UjILVDU_5 0 THE THE SHADOWS TEND TO GET A LITTLE BIT STRONGER AROUND THE NOSE
gC60UjILVDU_6 0 I'M ALSO IT ALSO HELPS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE INSET WHO'S EYES ARE PRETTY WELL AND SET AND I THINK IT TENDS TO WORK A LITTLE BETTER WITH WOMEN SOMETIMES
gC60UjILVDU_7 0 IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU JUST WANT TO PLAY AROUND
gC60UjILVDU_8 0 EACH SUBJECT IS DIFFERENT AND AND IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE YOU JUST KIND OF WANT TO MOVE YOUR LIGHT AROUND UNTIL YOU GET IT WHERE YOU WANT
gC60UjILVDU_9 0 AND THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW MOST IMPORTANT THING IS WHEN YOU START TO PLAY WITH THIS JUST PLAY WITH IT A LOT
gC60UjILVDU_10 0 AND THEN YOU'LL START TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AND AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT
gC60UjILVDU_11 0 IN THIS SEGMENT I KIND OF WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A POSITION THE SOFT BOX
gC60UjILVDU_12 0 SOMETIMES IT LOOKS GREAT JUST TO HAVE A KIND OF MAYBE A LITTLE MORE OF A FASHION LOOKED ALMOST HAVE A PRETTY MUCH STRAIGHT IN IT AND THEN YOU'RE KIND OF JUST KIND OF PEAKING AROUND THE SIDE GET THE SHOT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
gC60UjILVDU_13 0 THE NEXT THING THAT THE SOFT BOXES HEEL YOU CAN ELIMINATE THE BACKGROUND ALSO AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT A BIG STRONG SHADOW
Gv4uy35II0M_1 0 ANOTHER WAY TO DO SHADOWING ON YOUR DRAWING IS BY USING A VERY FINE TIPPED FELT PAN SO THIS EXAMPLE NOW WE'VE DRAWN IN OUR PLAYFUL CAT WITH SOME VERY BASIC COLORS AND I WANT TO ADD IN SOME SHADOWING SO BASICALLY WITH VERY VERY FINE LINES YOU CAN SEE THESE ARE REALLY SMALL VERY SMALL
Gv4uy35II0M_2 0 I TRACE ON THE BACK HERE YOU'RE GOING TO NOTICE VERY QUICKLY THAT THE DRAWING STARTS TO TAKE ON SOME MORE DEPTH SOME MORE WEIGHT THREE DIMENSIONAL ATTRIBUTES AS OPPOSED TO JUST HAVING A GOOD BUT STILL ULTIMATELY QUICKLY SCRIBBLED ON LINES WE STARTED WITH
Gv4uy35II0M_3 0 CARTOONS LIKE OTHER FORMS A DRAWINGS ARE STILL WORKS OF ART THAT YOU BUILD UP
Gv4uy35II0M_4 0 THEY ARE DIFFERENT LAYERS TO THEM
Gv4uy35II0M_5 0 THERE'S THE BASIC UNDER DRAWING
Gv4uy35II0M_6 0 THERE'S ADDING ON COLOR SHAPE SHADOW SO IN THIS CASE LET'S BRING THE SHADOW THAT'S HOW THE SHADOW GO ALL AROUND THE BODY SO BRING IT UP OVER HERE ON THE PALMS
Gv4uy35II0M_7 0 NOW NOTICE HOW I AM I DON'T TEND TO BRING THE SHADOW ALL THE WAY AROUND EVERYTHING
Gv4uy35II0M_8 0 I USUALLY FIND IT'S GOOD TO KIND OF PICK ASIDE AND LESS AN OBJECT SUPPOSED TO BE IN TOTAL DARKNESS SO KIND OF PICK A SIDE THAT YOU WANT THE SHADOW TO GO ON LIKE I'M DOING HERE
Gv4uy35II0M_9 0 YOU CAN EVEN SHADOW A LITTLE BIT OF THE WHISK AREA TO GIVE YOUR CAT A LITTLE MORE OF A SMILE THERE
Gv4uy35II0M_10 0 YOU CAN CATCH A LITTLE BIT OF A LINE
Gv4uy35II0M_11 0 THEY CAN ALSO ADD SHADOWING TO THE BALL OF YARN
Gv4uy35II0M_12 0 YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE THIS A LITTLE MORE PRONOUNCED IN YOUR CAT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER TO SEE SO UNDERNEATH HERE I'M GOING TO HAVE SOME SHADOWING GOING ON UNDERNEATH THE BALL ON THE UNDERSIDE BUT I'M NOT GOING TO EXTEND ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP SO EXPERIMENTER HOWEVER YOU LIKE WITH THE SHADOWING
Gv4uy35II0M_13 0 THE BASIC THING TO REMEMBER IS A VERY FINE FELT TIP PEN CAN BE EXCELLENT FOR ADDING SHADOW IN DEPTH TO YOUR CAT CARTOONS OR ANY CARTOONS FOR THAT MATTER
GqgNoF6Ndr0_1 0 AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO PUT THE BIKE ON THE FLOOR AND STAND OVER IT TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS WHERE I LIKE IT
GqgNoF6Ndr0_2 0 IN THIS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE I HAVE THE GRIP AND BRAKE LEVER ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HANDLE BAR I HAVE SOMETHING TO WORK WITH
GqgNoF6Ndr0_3 0 USUALLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE
GqgNoF6Ndr0_4 0 SO WHAT I DO IS I START OFF BY ADJUSTING MY GRIP WITH YOU LOCK ON STYLE GRIPS NOTICE THAT I HAVE BOTH HEADS I WANT TO ADJUST IT SO THE BOLT HEADS ARE ANYWHERE NEAR WHERE I'M GOING TO PUT MY HANDS BECAUSE THAT'S NOT VERY COMFORTABLE
GqgNoF6Ndr0_5 0 SO TAKE MY THREE MILLIMETER WRENCH OR IT'S A TO POINT FIVE MILLIMETER WRENCH IF YOU'RE USING THE OBI BRAND GRIPS
GqgNoF6Ndr0_6 0 TIGHTEN THIS UP TO A GOOD TORQUE I'M GOING TO TIGHTEN UP THE OTHER HEAD SO NOW I HAVE MY GRIPS INSTALL AND I'M READY TO SET UP MY BRAKE LEVER
GqgNoF6Ndr0_7 0 FOR ME OF BRAKE LEVER POSITION THIS A LOT MORE CRITICAL THAN SHIFTER POSITIONING BECAUSE BRAKES ARE IN THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOL YOU HAVE IN YOUR ARSENAL WHEN IT COMES TO CONTROL YOUR BIKE
GqgNoF6Ndr0_8 0 SO I LIKE TO SET THINGS UP SO I HAVE A NICE EVEN ANGLE DOWN MY HAND TO MY WRIST TO WRAP AROUND THE BRAKE LEVER ON I ALSO LIKE TO BE A PERSONALLY LIKE TO BE ABLE TO REACH THE BRAKE LEVER WITH MY HAND IS ON THE END OF THE HANDLEBAR LIKE THIS
GqgNoF6Ndr0_9 0 JUST ONE FINGER IS THE BRAKES ARE GOOD ENOUGH THAT I WON'T BE MY WHOLE HAND TO BREAK
GqgNoF6Ndr0_10 0 SOME PEOPLE PREFER TO USE TWO FINGERS OR OTHER FINGERS TO BREAK AND THEY MIGHT END UP SLIDING YOUR BRAKE LEVER TO HAVE THIS WHITE SO THAT IT'S MORE NATURAL TO HAVE THEIR HAND ON THE AND THE BAR PULL IN THE MIDDLE FINGER OR TWO FINGERS BUT THAT'S NOT MY PREFERENCE
GqgNoF6Ndr0_11 0 SO I'M GOING TO FIND THE ANGLE IT FEELS GOOD IN THIS FEELS PRETTY GOOD SO I'M GOING TO HOLD THAT GRAB MY FOUR MILLIMETER WRENCH AND TIGHTEN THESE UP FOR THE FINGER TIGHT
GqgNoF6Ndr0_12 0 THIS IS A REALLY LIGHT A APPLICATION YOU WANT TO STILL BE ABLE TO REACH DOWN AND ADJUST THESE BECAUSE THAT MEANS IF YOU CRASH I'M THEY WILL MOVE OUT OF THE WAY INSTEAD OF BREAKING
G9HKko_447Q_1 0 HI I'M KARINA FRALEY FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE ARE MAKING OUR PILLOW
G9HKko_447Q_2 0 SO WE'VE GONE AHEAD AND WE'VE CUT OUT OUR PILLOW AND NOW I'M GOING TO GIVE IT A ONCE OVER WITH MY IRON
G9HKko_447Q_3 0 WHICH IS FIRE IT UP AND READY TO GO BECAUSE I'M GOING TO NEED IT LATER ON TO USE WITH THE FUSIBLE A TAPE
G9HKko_447Q_4 0 RIGHT NOW I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT OF AN IRON AND THEN ONCE WE STUFF IT IT'S GOING TO BE NICE AND AND SMOOTH
G9HKko_447Q_5 0 ALRIGHT SO NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS PUT OUR RIGHT SIDES OF OUR FABRIC TOGETHER BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO SEW THEM AND

gM6tndOzWsU_4 0 I KNOW I NEED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MEMORY I KNOW I NEED A CERTAIN CPU I KNOW I NEED CERTAIN THINGS BUT HOW DO I FIND OUT IF THOSE THINGS WITH THEIR IN FUNCTIONAL
gM6tndOzWsU_5 0 START WITH FIND A PLACE WHERE THERE'S POWER WHERE THERE'S A MONITOR A KEYBOARD MOUSE AVAILABLE
gM6tndOzWsU_6 0 HOPEFULLY THE THE OWNER OF THE MACHINE THAT SEWING IT TO YOU WILL HAVE IT ALL AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT
gM6tndOzWsU_7 0 TURN IT ON MAKE SURE IT COMES UP WITHOUT ANY ERRORS

gM6tndOzWsU_14 0 HOW MUCH IS WORTH
gM6tndOzWsU_15 0 THAT'S DIFFERENT EVERY MARKET AND IT'S ANYBODY'S GAS
gM6tndOzWsU_16 0 SO IF I SUGGEST SAY WITH NEW COMPUTERS STARTING IN THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR RANGE UNLESS IT'S A REAL HIGH IN MACHINE YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN THAT
gM6tndOzWsU_17 0 NOW ANOTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS DOES THE PLACE YOU'RE BUYING IT GOING TO BACK IT OR GIVE WARRANTY THAT'S WORK A LITTLE EXTRA TOO BECAUSE ANY USE COMPUTER CAN BE REPLAY JUST WAITING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO FAIL
gM6tndOzWsU_18 0 SO JUST BE CAREFUL AS ANYTHING WHEN YOU'RE BUYING SOMETHING USED CHECK IT OUT KICK THE TIRE SO TO SPEAK MAKE SURE IT TURNS WHAT TURN TURNS ON OKAY AND THEN VERIFY THAT IT HAS THOSE THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO SEE

Hfh2d_K94HU_2 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FULL FIGHTERS TO LEARN TO FLY
Hfh2d_K94HU_3 0 LET'S GO TO THE GUITAR
Hfh2d_K94HU_4 0 THE WRIST STARTS OUT WITH THE SLIDE DOWN FROM I DON'T KNOW FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN FRET OF THE LOW E STRING NOTHING TO IT IS A SLIDE DOWN
Hfh2d_K94HU_5 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO USE A TECHNIQUE CALLED OCTAVE THING
Hfh2d_K94HU_6 0 IT'S KIND OF LIKE A POWER CHORD LIKE THIS
Hfh2d_K94HU_7 0 IN THIS CASE WE'RE GOING TO USE THE SECOND FRET OF THE A STRING THE FOURTH FRET A WE WOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT MIDDLE ONE BECAUSE IT'S AN OCTAVE
Hfh2d_K94HU_8 0 YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM
Hfh2d_K94HU_9 0 WE MUTED OUT WITH OUR INDEX FINGER
Hfh2d_K94HU_10 0 BUT WE STILL KEEP OUR PINKIE ON THE FOURTH FRET OF THE G STRING
Hfh2d_K94HU_11 0 NOW IF I HIT ALL THESE THREE TOGETHER IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS
Hfh2d_K94HU_12 0 HERE I'LL THAT MIDDLE ONES MUTED OUT
Hfh2d_K94HU_13 0 IF I HIT ALL THREE A I GET AN OCTAVE
Hfh2d_K94HU_14 0 THIS IS THE LOW OCTAVE AND IS THE HIGH OUT
Hfh2d_K94HU_15 0 DO THE SAME NOTE AN OCTAVE APART
Hfh2d_K94HU_16 0 THAT'S MY GOAL WITH THIS RED
Hfh2d_K94HU_17 0 I'M GOING TO GO TO AN FOR SLIDE IT UP TO WHICH IS FOUR IN SIX A STRING AND G STRING A AND I'M GOING TO BEND IT
Hfh2d_K94HU_18 0 THE END OF THIS RED I'M GOING TO BRING MY INDEX FINGER DOWN TO HAVE THE SECOND FRET OF THE D STRING HERE
Hfh2d_K94HU_19 0 THEN THE HIGH E STRING THEN
Hfh2d_K94HU_20 0 SO THIS CHORD IS TO ON THE A STRING SECOND FRET ON THE D STRING BOTH PADDED WITH MY INDEX FINGER FOURTH FRET OF THE G STRING WHICH IS MY PINKIE IN THESE HEIGHT TO OUR OR JUST WRING IT OUT WIDE OPEN
Hfh2d_K94HU_21 0 SLOWLY THIS RIFF SOUNDS LIKE THIS IT
Hfh2d_K94HU_22 0 THAT OCTAVE THE TRICK IS A COOL WAY TO RUN LINES INSTEAD OF JUST LIKE RUNNING A MELODY ON ONE STRING
Hfh2d_K94HU_23 0 YOU CAN DO THE OCTAVE TRICK AND AND MOVE IT UP IT SOUNDS THICKER
Hfh2d_K94HU_24 0 SO PRACTICE THAT TECHNIQUE IT'S REALLY COOL TO HAVE YOUR GUITAR PLAYING ARSENAL
Hfh2d_K94HU_25 0 IN THE NEXT SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IRON MAIDENS RUN TO THE
Hfh2d_K94HU_26 0 I'LL SEE YOU THERE
HiPCZZl51Ww_1 0 IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT LAG PUTTING PUTTING FROM OUTSIDE TWENTY FIVE FEET
HiPCZZl51Ww_2 0 HERE I'VE GOT ABOUT A THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY FOOTER ON THE PRACTICE PUTTING YOUR IN TEMPLE PALMS
HiPCZZl51Ww_3 0 AND MORE THAN ANYTHING WITH LAG PUTTING WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS GET A SENSE FOR THE OVERALL DISTANCE
HiPCZZl51Ww_4 0 THE SPEED OF THE PUTT IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT THEN THIS DIRECTION
HiPCZZl51Ww_5 0 NOW OF COURSE OF THE PART OF THE SLOPE YOU'RE PUTTING ON THIS PRETTY SEVERE YOU BETTER AIM IT OUT TO THE HIGH POINT
HiPCZZl51Ww_6 0 BUT MY POINT IS AS PEOPLE TEND TO FOCUS ON THE LINE AND FORGET ABOUT THE SPEED NOT REALIZING THAT THE ODDS OF BEEN MAKING THIS POT AREN'T VERY GOOD
HiPCZZl51Ww_7 0 AND THE ODDS OF THAN THREE PUTTING ARE PRETTY HIGH NOT BECAUSE THEY MISS THE SECOND ONE SO MUCH AS THEY DIDN'T LAG THE FIRST ONE CLOSE ENOUGH TO WHERE IT WAS YOU KNOW JUST A TAP IT IN
HiPCZZl51Ww_8 0 SO WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS I LIKE TO GET ABOUT HALF WAY AND I TRY TO GET A SENSE OF WHICH WITH THIS PART IS GOING TO BREAK
HiPCZZl51Ww_9 0 I SEE A BREAKING FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
HiPCZZl51Ww_10 0 SO I'M TRYING TO PICK A HIGH POINT IT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE BALL IN THE HOLE
HiPCZZl51Ww_11 0 I'LL GO UP TO THAT HIGH POINT IT AND I'LL MAKE A COUPLE PRACTICE STROKES LOOKING AT THE HOLE
HiPCZZl51Ww_12 0 JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF HOW HAT HOW HARD THE BALL NEEDS TO BE MOVING HERE FOR IT TO GET TO THE HOLE
HiPCZZl51Ww_13 0 THEN I'LL WALK BACK
HiPCZZl51Ww_14 0 I'VE GOT MY HIGH POINT OF THERE
HiPCZZl51Ww_15 0 I HAVE A SENSE OF HOW FAST IT WOULD BE FROM HALF WAY AND THEN I TRY TO POT IT TO THAT HALFWAY POINT WITH THE RIGHT SPEED
HiPCZZl51Ww_16 0 I MAKE ALL MY PRACTICE STROKES LOOKING AT THE TARGET
HiPCZZl51Ww_17 0 AGAIN AIM ISN'T NEARLY AS IMPORTANT AS SPEED
HiPCZZl51Ww_18 0 LOOK AT THE HOLE
HiPCZZl51Ww_19 0 THE LOOK OF THE HOLE
HiPCZZl51Ww_20 0 A SET UP TO IT
HiPCZZl51Ww_21 0 MY NAME IS OVER NOW
HiPCZZl51Ww_22 0 NOW A LOOK A COUPLE MORE TIMES JUST TO GET A FEEL FOR HOW FAR IT IS
HiPCZZl51Ww_23 0 WHAT I BRING MY EYES BACK TO THE BALL I GO AHEAD AND HIT IT
HiPCZZl51Ww_24 0 THAT'S WHEN THE OVERALL DISTANCES FRESHEST IN MY MIND AND I TEND TO ROLL THE RIGHT SPEED MORE TIMES THE KNOT
gT5Su9TcfGI_1 0 BID WHIST WITH KITTY IN JOKERS
gT5Su9TcfGI_2 0 THE ROOTS OF BID WHIST OF COURSE GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL GAME OF WHICH THAT WAS CREATED IN THE LATE SIXTEEN HUNDREDS EARLY SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS AND ARE WRITTEN EXTENSIVELY BY EDMAN OIL JAMES CLAY AND OTHERS
gT5Su9TcfGI_3 0 CHANGE CLAY WAS A CARD GAME WRITER FROM THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS AND YOU RUN A COMPLETE TREE DISARM ON BID WHIST AND WHIST IN GENERAL ABOUT EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOR
gT5Su9TcfGI_4 0 UP UNTIL ABOUT NINETEEN TWENTY THE GAME OF WAYS THAT WAS PLAYED WAS PRETTY STANDARD
gT5Su9TcfGI_5 0 AND THE DETERMINATION OF TRUMP FOR EXAMPLE WAS NOT BY BIDDING BUT WAS BY THE BOTTOM CARD
gT5Su9TcfGI_6 0 SO IF THE HAND IS DEALT OUR WOULD SAY OK THAT'S TRUMP
gT5Su9TcfGI_7 0 WELL WHAT WAS VERY FRUSTRATING AS YOU PICK UP A BEAUTIFUL HAND THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS
gT5Su9TcfGI_8 0 I MEAN YOU MAY NOT HAVE TWELVE HEARTS
gT5Su9TcfGI_9 0 LET'S JUST SAY YOU HAVE A NICE COLOR HEARTS SUIT FOR EXAMPLE AND SOME SIDE ACES
gT5Su9TcfGI_10 0 BUT THE DECK SAYS BATCH TRUMP
gT5Su9TcfGI_11 0 WHERE'S THE SCALE
gT5Su9TcfGI_12 0 I MEAN YOU JUST COOK COMPLETELY WORKED OUT OF A GREAT HAND LIKE THAT
gT5Su9TcfGI_13 0 SO THEY DECIDED TO HAVE BIDDING
gT5Su9TcfGI_14 0 AND WHAT CAME OUT OF THAT WAS THE AFTER MENTION STRAIT WHIST
gT5Su9TcfGI_15 0 NOW ABOUT NINETEEN TWENTY OF SO ARM A GROUP OF PLAYERS PRIMARILY IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY DECIDED TO INNOVATE THE GAME A LITTLE BIT AND ADD ON THE FACT THAT WE CAN MAKE THIS GAME WE CAN JAZZ THIS UP A LITTLE BIT
gT5Su9TcfGI_16 0 MAKE THIS A LOT MORE FUN MAKE THIS A LOT MORE COMPETITIVE
gT5Su9TcfGI_17 0 SO THEN THEY ADDED JOKERS
gT5Su9TcfGI_18 0 JOKERS ARE ALWAYS AROUND IN THE DECK AND JOKERS A TERM THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN EUCHRE JOKER JOKER AND SO FORTH AND WAS ADDED TO THE DECK BY BICYCLE CARDS
gT5Su9TcfGI_19 0 US PLAYING GUARD FROM YOUR BODY TEENY
gT5Su9TcfGI_20 0 IF YOU LOOK AT A TYPICAL DECK OF CARDS YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE IS A BIG JOKER AND A LITTLE JOKER
gT5Su9TcfGI_21 0 NOW SOME OF THE CUSTOM SPADES EFFECTS THAT BICYCLE MAKES HAPPEN TO HAVE A NICE BIG THINGS AS A BIG JOKER LITTLE JOKER BUT THESE WILL DO IS FINE
gT5Su9TcfGI_22 0 YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS ONE ON A BICYCLE IS BIGGER THAN THIS ONE
gT5Su9TcfGI_23 0 THESE THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCE WHEN THE METAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BID WHIST AND STRAIT WHIST IS THE FACT THAT A YOU HAVE JOKERS THAT ARE TRUMP
gT5Su9TcfGI_24 0 THE BIG JOKER IS BIGGER THAN THE ACE OF SPADES AND IS BIGGER THAN THE LITTLE JOKER
gT5Su9TcfGI_25 0 THE LITTLE JOKER SUPERSEDES OR BIGGER THAN THE ACE OF SPADES BRINGING THE ACE OF TRUMP
gT5Su9TcfGI_26 0 SO WE WANT TO LOOK AT A TRUMP SUIT THAT WAS UPTOWN WE WOULD SEE THAT HE HAS THE RANKING
gT5Su9TcfGI_27 0 BIG JOKER LITTLE JOKER ACE KING QUEEN AND SO FORTH
gT5Su9TcfGI_28 0 SO THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO ARE THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A JOKER IN THE KITTY
gT5Su9TcfGI_29 0 A LOT OF HISTORY THAT'S REALLY GOES BACK TO THE NINETEEN TWENTIES THIRTIES FORTIES FIFTIES AND IT'S PLAYED HUGE BID WHIST COMMUNITY
gT5Su9TcfGI_30 0 BID WHIST MEANING WITH KITTY AND JOKERS AND SO FORTH
gT5Su9TcfGI_31 0 ANOTHER ASPECT IS THAT IT IS THE SAME COMMUNITY OF AFRICAN AMERICAN PLAYERS WHO ALSO CREATED THE GAME OF SPADES
gT5Su9TcfGI_32 0 SO YOU HAVE BID WHIST WITH KITTY IN JOKERS IN SPADES
gT5Su9TcfGI_33 0 VERY POPULAR IN THE LATE THIRTIES THROUGHOUT SECOND MORE WAR AND THEN FROM THERE WE'RE GOING TO THE COLLEGES AND OTHER PLACES
gT5Su9TcfGI_34 0 PEOPLE OF ALWAYS HAVE A GREAT TIME WITH THE GAME
gT5Su9TcfGI_35 0 GREAT RICH HISTORY

gFZiilQMutQ_7 0 WE'LL JUST BE ABLE TO SHUT OFF THAT BALL VALVE
gFZiilQMutQ_8 0 THE NEXT THING THAT WE NEED TO DO IS RELIEVE ANY WATER PRESSURE THAT IS STILL IN THE LINES SO YOU CAN GO TO ANY FAUCET IN YOUR HOUSE AND TURN THAT ON AND WEIGHTS WHOLE ALL THAT PRESSURE HAS BEEN RELIEVE FROM THE FAUCET
gFZiilQMutQ_9 0 WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPENED IS WHEN WE CUT THE PIPE WE DON'T WANT IT TO START SPRAYING WATER EVERYWHERE SO THAT'S WHY WE DO THIS
gVxZwMK5kgc_1 0 OKAY THE FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO JUST LIKE IN THE LAST RECIPE IS CREAM THE BUTTER AND SUGAR
gVxZwMK5kgc_2 0 SO THIS IS ONE CUP OF BUTTER AND IT'S GOING TO TOSS THAT RIGHT IN THERE IT UP AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU BAKE WITH SOFTEN BUTTER
gVxZwMK5kgc_3 0 IF YOU HAVE THE TIME TAKE YOUR BLOCK OF BUTTER OUT LEAVE IT OUT FOR AN HOUR
gVxZwMK5kgc_4 0 IT SHOULD JUST BE ABLE TO MAKE A FINGERPRINT JUST LIKE THAT THAT'S ABOUT HOW SOFT IT SHOULD BE
gVxZwMK5kgc_5 0 HEY I'M YOU CAN ALSO POT HARD BETTER IN THE OF AIR IN THE MICROWAVE FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE SECONDS THIRTY SECONDS IF IT STARTS ALL NOW THOUGH THAN IT'S NO GOOD

gVxZwMK5kgc_9 0 SO YOU WANT TO THE CREAM THIS ONE MEDIUM SPEED FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES
gVxZwMK5kgc_10 0 IT'S SO WE'RE GOING TO LET THAT GO AND WHEN THAT'S FITTED I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MIX THE DRY INGREDIENTS

hJ_CfDvv_sw_1 0 THERE'S A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPEN VERY RARELY IN THE GAME OF BASEBALL
hJ_CfDvv_sw_2 0 WILL DEFINITELY TALK ABOUT THOSE RIGHT NOW
hJ_CfDvv_sw_3 0 THESE WILL CALL RARE PLACE
hJ_CfDvv_sw_4 0 THEY CAN BE THINGS LIKE BATTER INTERFERENCE WHICH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER HOW TO SCORE ABOUT RIDING INT AND WHAT THIS MEANS IS THE BATTER IS GOING TO BE THROWN OUT
hJ_CfDvv_sw_5 0 THIS IS A WAY TO GET OUT IN THE GAME OF BASEBALL MEANING THAT THE BATTER HAS MADE CONTACT WITH THE FIELD
hJ_CfDvv_sw_6 0 OKAY NOW THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN CATCHER'S INTERFERENCE IN WHICH THE BATTER WOULD ACTUALLY GET A HIT
hJ_CfDvv_sw_7 0 YOU STILL DENOTED DENOTE THAT WITH AN INT BUT YOU DRAW YOUR LINE ADVANCING FROM HOME TO FIRST BASE
hJ_CfDvv_sw_8 0 THIS IS WHEN THE BATTER SWINGS THE BAT MAKES CONTACT WITH THE CATCHER'S GLOVE OR THE CATCHER SOME OF THE CATCHER GETS IN THE WAY SOMEHOW UP THE BATTER SO HE DOES GET ON BASE
hJ_CfDvv_sw_9 0 THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF AN ODD BALL PLAY
hJ_CfDvv_sw_10 0 I HIT BY PITCH HAPPENS A LITTLE BIT MORE OFTEN THAN IT SHOULD
hJ_CfDvv_sw_11 0 THAT MEANS THAT THE PITCHER'S ON ACTUALLY THROWING THE BALL AND HIT THE BATTER
hJ_CfDvv_sw_12 0 SOMETIMES THAT HAPPENS INTENTIONALLY
hJ_CfDvv_sw_13 0 BASEBALL LIKES TO POLICE ITSELF SO SOMETIMES WHEN A BATTER HAS I'VE SHOWN A PITCHER UP OR INSULT WITH THE PITCHER IN SOME WAY THAN THE PITCHER IN THE NEXT INNING WILL HIT HIM INTENTIONALLY
hJ_CfDvv_sw_14 0 SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS ACCIDENTALLY WE STILL TO NOTE THAT WITH AN H BEAT THE KIT BY PITCH
hJ_CfDvv_sw_15 0 THE OTHER THINGS THAT CAN COUNT HERE ARE WILD PITCHES WHICH IS OUR WPA
hJ_CfDvv_sw_16 0 THIS IS WHEN THE PITCHER THROWS THE BALL WILDLY OUT OF THE CATCHER'S RAIN
hJ_CfDvv_sw_17 0 THIS IS NOT CONSIDERED AN ERROR
hJ_CfDvv_sw_18 0 IT'S DENOTED IN TALLIED SEPARATELY IN BASEBALL
hJ_CfDvv_sw_19 0 YOU MARK IT WITH ADOBE P AND THE PITCHER ON WILL HAVE THAT CAPTAIN STATISTICAL CATEGORY
hJ_CfDvv_sw_20 0 NOW PASSED BALL IS VERY SIMILAR TO A WILD PITCH
hJ_CfDvv_sw_21 0 THAT MEANS THAT THE CATCHER SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT THE BALL BUT DID
hJ_CfDvv_sw_22 0 THE BALL IS THROWN WITHIN HIS OWN OF CATCHING ABILITY BUT IT'S SOMEHOW GOT PAST
hJ_CfDvv_sw_23 0 NOW THAT IS COUNT AS AN ERROR
hJ_CfDvv_sw_24 0 THAT'S AN E TO
hJ_CfDvv_sw_25 0 AND THOSE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE REAR PLAYS IN BASEBALL
hJ_CfDvv_sw_26 0 YOU WON'T SEE HIM OFTEN BUT IT'S GOOD TO KNOW HOW TO MARK THEM IF YOU SEE THEM

GVzIvgu48HY_3 0 WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A MASK YOU COULD INVEST ANYWHERE FROM A FIN FIFTEEN TO A HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS ON A MASS DEPENDING ON THE BRAND AND THE NUMBER FEATURES YOU WANT IN IT WHETHER YOU WANT AN ANTI GLARE ANTI FOG FINISHES FANS AND WHAT NOT
GVzIvgu48HY_4 0 SO YOU CAN OVERBILL THE MASK AND INVEST QUITE A BIT OF MONEY AND ONE JUST TO MAKE IT TRICK
GVzIvgu48HY_5 0 BUT THE MASK WHETHER IT'S A STANDARDIZED MASK ARE VERY EXPENSIVE MASK IS A STRAIGHT COMPLIANT IT COMPLIANCE ISSUE
GVzIvgu48HY_6 0 AND IT'S REALLY THE THE GOLDEN RULE IN PAINT BALL

GDRGPctnjW4_2 0 WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO IS THAT THE SPINE IS REALLY THE HOUSE THAT PROTECTS THE NERVES THAT ARE TRANSMITTING THESE MESSAGES AND SO AS THE SPINE GETS MISALIGNED AS THE SPINE BECOMES TORQUED TWISTED WHAT HAVE YOU IT PUTS PRESSURE ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT THEN ASCENDING THE MESSAGES OUT AND WHICH CAN BE PAINT OR FUNCTION
GDRGPctnjW4_3 0 SO PAIN FIBERS ARE BEING AFFECTED THEY'RE GOING TO FEEL PAINT THAT'S BURNING RADIATING PAINT LOCAL PAIN MUSCLE TENSION PRESSURE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS

gjexrkXhRQM_2 0 I'M TATTOOING HAS BEEN AROUND FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS WE'VE
gjexrkXhRQM_3 0 USE ANYTHING FROM BONE TO WOULD ON YOU NAME IT YOU KNOW TEETH
gjexrkXhRQM_4 0 WE'VE BEEN HAVE THIS URGE OR THIS PRIMAL URGENT ASKED TATTOO OURSELVES FOR CENTURIES IT'S ENTRIES
gjexrkXhRQM_5 0 YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE FROM FORTY ON INDONESIA THEY'VE BEEN TATTOOING EACH OTHER FOR A LONG TIME
gjexrkXhRQM_6 0 YOU KNOW THE POLYNESIAN IT'S THE NOTE C YOU'VE NEW ZEALAND MAORI THEY'VE BEEN TATTOO THEMSELVES HEAVILY FOR MANY YEARS TO MIX AS WELL IT'S IT'S AN ANCIENT TRADITION AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO GO ANYTIME SOON AND START A LONG TIME AGO
gjexrkXhRQM_7 0 JUST DESIRE
gjexrkXhRQM_8 0 HERE I HAVE AN OLD TATTOO BOX BONY ALL
gjexrkXhRQM_9 0 THIS IS A TATTOO SET UP FOR THE IDEA OF WHAT YOU NEED TO YOUR OF MARRIED COUPLE BASICALLY IN THIS IS WHAT THIS IS USED FOR IT
gjexrkXhRQM_10 0 THE INK TO BE PUT IN HERE AND IT BE POUND DOWN FROM THEIR STICK I DON'T HAVE THAT WAS ME SAVAGED SAY
gjexrkXhRQM_11 0 BUT THEY WOULD MAKE THAT IN HERE
gjexrkXhRQM_12 0 AND THEN HERE ON THE BOTTOM HAS A TATTOOING TOOLS
gjexrkXhRQM_13 0 HERE'S A STAMP THEY WOULD USE TO PUT THIS AN INTIMATE APPLY THIS THE SKIN ALMOST LIKE A STENCIL
gjexrkXhRQM_14 0 IT'S GOT A BUTTERFLY ON AND THAT'S THE SYMBOL FOR THE BORNEO FOR THE
gjexrkXhRQM_15 0 IT IS ON THIS HAS BEEN MODIFIED A LITTLE BIT IT'S NOT AS TRADITIONAL FORM USE WE'RE NOT USE KIND MEALS BEFORE BUT HERE IS BASICALLY THE TOOL TO APPLY THE INK
gjexrkXhRQM_16 0 AND THIS WOULD BE USED AS SUCH AND YOU WOULD JUST KIND OF TAP IT IN YOUR SKIN LIKE THIS
gjexrkXhRQM_17 0 AND THIS IS PRETTY MUCH THE ANCIENT METHOD OF TATTOOING
gjexrkXhRQM_18 0 IN JAPAN THEY WOULD USE YOU KNOW HAND POKE THE BOARD IN THE SMALL ONES THEY WOULD DO A TAPPING
gjexrkXhRQM_19 0 THE TEST TOWEL MEANS TO TAP LITERALLY AND THAT WAS DONE BY THE MAORI AND THE POLYNESIAN AS WELL
gjHeEPqP6AY_1 0 HATE FIRST THING WE WANT TO DO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LISTENING IT'S TALK ABOUT NOISE
gjHeEPqP6AY_2 0 NOW WHAT'S NOISE
gjHeEPqP6AY_3 0 WELL NOISES A LOT OF THINGS
gjHeEPqP6AY_4 0 BUT THERE'S TWO SPECIFIC KINDS OF NOISE THAT REALLY GETS IN OUR WAY WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO BE GOOD LISTENERS INTERNAL NOISE AND EXTERNAL NOISE
gjHeEPqP6AY_6 0 EXTERNAL NOISE IS THE BUS THAT GOES BY WHILE YOUR YOU KNOW THE OUTSIDE THE WHERE BERBER A.K.A
gjHeEPqP6AY_7 0 THAT'S EXTERNAL NOISE
gjHeEPqP6AY_8 0 OR MAYBE THE AIR CONDITIONER KICK SOMETHING ALONG THAT KICKS ON
gjHeEPqP6AY_9 0 OUR HARLEY DAVIDSON MOTORCYCLE DRIVES BY
gjHeEPqP6AY_10 0 WHATEVER NOISES OUT THERE
gjHeEPqP6AY_11 0 SOMEBODY WALKS IN RIGHT NOW ON SLAMS THE STORE I'VE GOT SOME EXTERNAL NOISE THAT'S AFFECTING MY ABILITY TO LISTEN
gjHeEPqP6AY_12 0 THEN THERE'S INTERNAL NOISE
gjHeEPqP6AY_13 0 INTERNAL NOISES HOT SO HUNGRY MY STOMACH IS RUMBLING
gjHeEPqP6AY_14 0 HI I'M SO GOING TO KILL HER FOR BORROWING MY SWEATER
gjHeEPqP6AY_15 0 OKAY THAT'S ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
gjHeEPqP6AY_16 0 OR MAYBE YOU GOT TO FIGHT WITH YOUR HUSBAND OR YOUR WIFE OR YOUR BOYFRIEND GIRLFRIEND OR YOUR WIFE OR YOUR HUSBAND ARE ALL OF THE ABOVE
gjHeEPqP6AY_17 0 MAYBE YOU'RE TIRED MAYBE YOUR COLD GET YOUR RED SWEATER
gjHeEPqP6AY_18 0 ANYTHING THAT'S GOING ON INTERNALLY THAT'S AFFECTING YOU FROM BEING ABLE TO LISTEN
gjHeEPqP6AY_19 0 OR THESE THINGS CONTROLLABLE WHOLE LOT OF THEM ARE ESPECIALLY THE INTERNAL ONES
gjHeEPqP6AY_20 0 BUT WE HAVE TO GET TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN BOWL LOCK THEM OUT AND FOCUS
gjHeEPqP6AY_21 0 FOCUS ON THE MESSAGE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO RECEIVE
gjHeEPqP6AY_22 0 AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES A GOOD LISTENER
hGCrLx07O2M_1 0 BEGIN WITH YOUR LEGS STRETCHED OUT IN FRONT OF YOU
hGCrLx07O2M_2 0 THEN BEFORE WE GO INTO THE NEXT POSE IS GOING TO CHECK OUT THE CURVE IN YOUR LOWER BACK
hGCrLx07O2M_3 0 IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT WHEN WE DO SEATED HIP OPENERS OF FORWARD BENDS OR TWIST THAT WE CREATE A NATURAL CURVE IN THE LOWER BACK BEFORE WE BEND FORWARD
hGCrLx07O2M_4 0 SO IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE VERTEBRAE OR YOUR BACK AROUND IN THE BACK BECAUSE YOUR HAMSTRINGS ARE TIGHT EIGHT YOUR ABDOMINALS ARE TIE THAT MEANS YOU NEED TO SIT UP ON A BLANKET OR A BLOCK UNTIL YOU CAN GET A CURVE IN YOUR LOWER BACK
hGCrLx07O2M_5 0 SO GO AHEAD AND DO THAT NOW
hGCrLx07O2M_6 0 AND THEN FROM THERE YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR LEFT HEEL BACK INTO THE GRIND
hGCrLx07O2M_7 0 THE LEFT KNEE CAN GO A LITTLE WIDER OUT TO THE SIDE PLACE YOUR FINGERTIPS OUTSIDE YOUR HIPS WITH YOUR INHALATION LENGTHEN YOUR SPINE UP TOWARD THE SKY
hGCrLx07O2M_8 0 FROM THAT LENGTH ON YOUR EXHALATION TWIST TOWARD THE RATE
hGCrLx07O2M_9 0 THEN AGAIN INHALE PUSH YOUR FINGERTIPS INTO THE EARTH AND LENGTHEN YOUR SPINE WAY AT AND FEEL THAT CURVE IN YOUR LOWER BACK AND ALSO THE LOWER BELLIES LIFTING UP
hGCrLx07O2M_10 0 WITH ONE MORE BREATH WE CAN BEGIN TO FOLD FORWARD AND USING A STRAP CAN BE REALLY HELPFUL
hGCrLx07O2M_11 0 SO YOU CAN TAKE A STRAP AROUND THE BALLS OF YOUR TOES AND FOR SOME OF US IF WE DON'T HAVE A CURVE IN THE LOW BACK WE JUST WANT TO STAY UP RIGHT AND ACTUALLY STAYING MORE UPRIGHT AND TRYING TO CREATE A CURVE WILL GIVE YOU A REALLY GOOD STRETCH
hGCrLx07O2M_12 0 OR IF YOU DO HAVE A CURVE AND GO AHEAD AND START TO FOLD FORWARD
hGCrLx07O2M_13 0 AS YOU FOLD FORWARD YOU CAN PULL A LITTLE BIT ON THE STRAP AND STRETCH FORWARD THROUGH YOUR HEART
hGCrLx07O2M_14 0 INHALE TO LIFT BACK OUT
goyXJUwUyCE_1 0 IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO CHANGE THE SETTINGS ON YOUR MASTER THE MASTER CHANNEL AND AUTOMATE SETTINGS AND THE MASTER CHANNEL
goyXJUwUyCE_2 0 SO AGAIN LIKE ALL THESE OTHER OTHER PARAMETERS YOU CAN EDIT VIA THE MIXING OR THE EDITING WINDOW
goyXJUwUyCE_3 0 THE MIXING WINDOW IS A LITTLE HARDER
goyXJUwUyCE_4 0 IT'S A LITTLE MORE
goyXJUwUyCE_5 0 IT'S HARD TO BE SMOOTH BECAUSE YOU'RE MOVING IT WITH A MOUSE UNLESS YOU HAVE AN EXTERNAL MIXING INTERFACE
goyXJUwUyCE_6 0 AND AGAIN YOU HAVE THE REED TOUCH LATCH RIGHT OPTIONS
goyXJUwUyCE_7 0 AND ANY PLUG IN THAT YOU HAVE ON THE MASTER CHANNEL SAY A COMPRESSION OR LIMITING PLUGIN WILL STAY UP STILL BE SHOWN IN THE ACTUAL MASTER CHANNEL ON THE MIXING WINDOW OR THE EDITING WINDOW
goyXJUwUyCE_8 0 SO THAT YOU CAN STILL DRAW IN AND CHANGE VOLUMES ON THE MASK CHANNEL
goyXJUwUyCE_9 0 AS YOU CAN SEE AT THE END OF THIS TRACK I'VE DONE A FADE OUT THE DRAWING IN ON THE MASHER CHANNEL
goyXJUwUyCE_10 0 IT MAKES A VERY EASY SO YOU CAN SPECIFICALLY SAY WHEN YOU WANT THE TRACTOR AND WHEN YOU WANT THE FADE OUT THE START
goyXJUwUyCE_11 0 SAME WITH THE FADE IN
goyXJUwUyCE_12 0 THERE'S AND THINGS LIKE THAT ALLOW YOU TO REALLY MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THINGS HAPPENING EXACTLY YOU WANT TO START AND WITH THE MASK SHOW
gOjCrsdx9S8_1 0 HI I'M KELLI ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME TIPS AND TECHNIQUES THAT I USE WHEN CONCEALING DARK CIRCLES UNDER THE EYES
gOjCrsdx9S8_2 0 SO THERE'S SOME DIFFERENT TOOLS AS YOU CAN USE WHEN YOU'RE APPLYING YOUR CONCEALER
gOjCrsdx9S8_3 0 OF COURSE A GREAT TOOL IS ALWAYS VERY ACCESSIBLE TO YOU IS YOUR FINGERS
gOjCrsdx9S8_4 0 YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU ARE WORKING AROUND THE EYE AREA YOU'RE USING JUST YOUR RING FINGER SO YOU DON'T COOLER TUG OF THE EYE AREA
gOjCrsdx9S8_5 0 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO WORK AND JUST AS LIGHT PADDING MOTION
gOjCrsdx9S8_6 0 YOU NEVER WANT TO RUB THE CONCEALER BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO END UP RUBBING IT RIGHT OFF
gOjCrsdx9S8_7 0 YOU JUST WANT TO KIND OF PAT IT INTO THE SKIN SO IT WILL COVER WHERE YOU NEED IT TO COVER
gOjCrsdx9S8_8 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE A CONCEALER BRUSH WHICH LOOKS LIKE THIS A CONCEALER BRUSH IS USUALLY MADE FROM SYNTHETIC A BRISTLES IT'LL BE A LITTLE BIT STIFFER SO YOU CAN USE THIS IN A PADDING MOTION TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE COVERAGE
gOjCrsdx9S8_9 0 OR SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO USE A SPONGE THIS IS A LATEX FREE SPONGE WEDGE AND YOU CAN USE THAT TO PAT AND COVER
gOjCrsdx9S8_10 0 IF YOU HAVE MORE EXTREME AREAS THAT YOU NEED A LITTLE BIT HEAVIER COVERAGE ON SOMETIMES A SPONGE WORK A LITTLE BIT BETTER FOR YOU BECAUSE IT WILL HOLD A LITTLE BIT MORE CONCENTRATION OF PRODUCT IN THERE AND THEN YOU CAN PATTERN ON
gOjCrsdx9S8_11 0 SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TOOLS THAT YOU CAN USE WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO CONCEAL AND BASED ON HOW MUCH COVERAGE YOU NEED OR WHAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WORKING WITH THAT WILL LEAD YOU TO WHAT TYPE OF TOOL THAT YOU NEED TO USE
gOjCrsdx9S8_12 0 SO THOSE ARE A FEW OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN APPLY CONCEALER
gPTIs7lGMvM_1 0 MY NAME IS JARED TODD AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO APPLY YOUR PATTERN TO THE STEEL TO GET READY TO PROFILE THE BLADE
gPTIs7lGMvM_2 0 HOW I APPLY MY PATTERNS IS IS AFTER I SKETCH OUT MY PATTERN AND GET IT IS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE TO WHAT I HAVE I WANT ONE I HAVE A IT'S A SPRAY ADHESIVE IT'S LIKE LIQUID SCOTCH TAPE IT'S IN THE CAN
gPTIs7lGMvM_3 0 I SPRAY TO THE BACK OF THE PIECE OF PAPER TO HAVE MY PATTERN ON THE OTHER SIDE AND I STICK IT ON THE STEEL SO THAT STUCK ON THERE PRETTY GOOD
gPTIs7lGMvM_4 0 THEN WHAT I DO TO WATERPROOF THE PAPER SO THAT IT DOESN'T WHERE AWAY WHAM GRINDING AS I FOUND THAT THE HARDWARE STORE THERE'S A WOOD HARDENER MADE BY MEN AWAKE ONE THAT I JUST PUT A COUPLE COATS ON HERE AND IT HARDENS IN SEALS IT FROM FROM WATER
gPTIs7lGMvM_5 0 THE KNIFE JUST GET HOT WHEN I GRIND AT TWENTY TO DENT DIP IT IN THE WATER SO THEY CAN COOL IT DOWN
gPTIs7lGMvM_6 0 SOME PEOPLE DON'T USE THIS TYPE OF TECHNIQUE
gPTIs7lGMvM_7 0 THEY USE WHEN THEY GET THIS IT'S A BLUE TYPE OF PAINT
gPTIs7lGMvM_8 0 IT'S A LAYOUT PAINT
gPTIs7lGMvM_9 0 THEY PAINTED ON THE PIECE OF STEEL THAT THEY WANT AND THEY'LL PUT THEIR PATTERN DOWN AND THEN THEY'LL USE WHEN I'M METAL SCRIBE OR SHARP OBJECT AND THEY'LL SCRIBE THROUGH THE PAINT ON TO THE STEEL
gPTIs7lGMvM_10 0 SOME PEOPLE PREFER THAT OTHER THEN USING THE PAPER METHOD
gPTIs7lGMvM_11 0 I FIND THAT THE PAPER METHOD WORKS THE BEST FOR ME BECAUSE ONCE I GET MY PATTERN DRAWN OUT I GO TO THE COPY CENTER AND I MAKE YOU KNOW AS MANY COPIES AS I NEED
gPTIs7lGMvM_12 0 A DISADVANTAGE OF IT IS THAT YOU KNOW IT WILL WEAR OUT OFF IF YOU RUB ON IT TOO HARD
gPTIs7lGMvM_13 0 BUT IT COMES RIGHT OFF WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH YOUR KNIFE
gPTIs7lGMvM_14 0 YOU CAN PEEL IT OFF
gPTIs7lGMvM_15 0 ONE OR SOME PEOPLE JUST TAKE A MARKER AND THEY'LL JUST DRAW THEIR PATTERN RIGHT ON THE STEEL
gPTIs7lGMvM_16 0 JUST BY HAND
gPTIs7lGMvM_17 0 HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DO IT THERE'S NO WRONG WAY
gPTIs7lGMvM_18 0 I JUST FOUND THAT THIS WAY WORKS THE BEST FOR WHAT I NEED

_gmqSxZ0I4s_6 0 REMEMBER MOST DEALERSHIPS CAN'T CELL OR RESALE A CAR THAT HAS A SALVAGE TITLE SO YOU'RE USUALLY SAFE THEIR HOWEVER WHEN SHOPPING FOR A CAR FROM A PRIVATE PARTY MAKE SURE YOU FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THE CAR HAS A SALVAGE PADDLE

gVzxBOgmMZo_8 0 AND THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HELP MALL BULLETIN K SO YOU SEE HOW THE CHOCOLATE IS SINK IN A LITTLE BIT INTO THE CHEESECAKE
G_yLd9y2nLk_1 0 OKAY THE FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WE TALKED ABOUT THE NEUTRAL STANCE
G_yLd9y2nLk_2 0 AND THIS IS A TYPE OF BALL IS A BALL IN FRONT OF YOU YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO STEP INTO IT AND KIND OF THE TAP THE PLAYER
G_yLd9y2nLk_3 0 SO THIS IS THE MORE THAT BOARD TYPE MOTION
G_yLd9y2nLk_4 0 BASICALLY THIS IS AGAIN FOR ALL LEVELS ALL OUT ALL AGES
G_yLd9y2nLk_5 0 SO WHAT DOES GOBLIN HERE IS GOING TO DO IS GOING TO STEP FORWARD AND THE CORE IS GOING TO BASICALLY HIT A CROSS COURT STEPPING TOWARDS THAT DIRECTION WITH HIS LEFT FOOT
G_yLd9y2nLk_6 0 AND AS BODY'S GOING IN THAT DIRECTION AS WELL
G_yLd9y2nLk_7 0 SO WATCH THIS LEFT FOOT AS IT COMES AROUND THE SPORT AND STEPPING INTO THE CHORD
G_yLd9y2nLk_8 0 JUST LIKE OKAY NOW THE SECOND PHASE AND THAT WOULD BE THE COUNTRY STEP
G_yLd9y2nLk_9 0 SEE HOW I'M STEPPING FORWARD RIGHT THERE IN THE SECOND BASEMAN HAS RIGHT LEG IS GOING TO COME AROUND TO HELP THEM RETURN FOR THE NEXT SHOT

GGh8knFY2rw_1 0 FOR ANOTHER EDGED WEAPON ATTACK OR DEFENSE FROM A STRAIGHT STAB WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE INSIDE NOW
GGh8knFY2rw_2 0 NOW WE'RE LOOK AT ANOTHER DISARM
GGh8knFY2rw_3 0 WHAT IS THE SAME PRINCIPLE
GGh8knFY2rw_4 0 OFF THE LINE IS ALWAYS
GGh8knFY2rw_5 0 THIS I'M GOING TO ATTACK THE INSIDE OF THE FOREARM
GGh8knFY2rw_6 0 IT'S RIGHT NATURALLY AM
GGh8knFY2rw_7 0 I'M ALSO GOING TO ATTACK THE WRIST AS WELL
GGh8knFY2rw_8 0 I'LL BE SIMULTANEOUS
GGh8knFY2rw_9 0 OBVIOUSLY IT'S PRETTY PHYSICALLY COMPLICATED TO DEGREE
GGh8knFY2rw_10 0 BUT I WANT TO KEEP IT KEEP THE MOTIONS NICE SHORTEN SWEET TO THE POINT
GGh8knFY2rw_11 0 MY GOAL IS TO STRIKE THIS HERE
GGh8knFY2rw_12 0 CAUSE STRETCHING THE TISSUE IN THE CUT THEM INTO THE WRIST AS I DO THAT I BEGIN TO GET A NICE BEND IN THE WRIST
GGh8knFY2rw_13 0 SO AS DANIEL COMES IN
GGh8knFY2rw_15 0 START TO STRETCH IT OUT
GGh8knFY2rw_16 0 HOLD ON TO
GGh8knFY2rw_17 0 WITH A NICE AND SLOW
GGh8knFY2rw_18 0 HERE JUST LIKE THIS
GGh8knFY2rw_19 0 AS IT COMES IN
GGh8knFY2rw_20 0 BY STRIKING HERE I STRETCH THE HAND OUT
GGh8knFY2rw_21 0 YOU'LL STILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTROL HERE TO MY STRIKING IN THE WRIST I GET A NATURAL FLEX STATION OF THE WRIST WHICH CAUSES THE FINGERS TO STRETCH OUT ALLOWS A KNIFE TO FLY AWAY
GGh8knFY2rw_22 0 SO ONCE AGAIN AS DANIEL COMES IN I'M STRIKING IN THE FORM DOWN INTO THE ARM DOWN THE WRIST AND COMES UP KNIFE COMES OUT
GGh8knFY2rw_23 0 THAT'S A NICE INSIDE PARRYING STRIKING TECHNIQUE FOR STRAIGHT STEP
hCvNibEfOOM_1 0 HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON
hCvNibEfOOM_2 0 WHAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE A SMALL FORWARD IS IN A POWER FORWARD IS
hCvNibEfOOM_3 0 THE FOUR POSITION IS USUALLY A LITTLE BIT BIGGER OF A PLAYER THEN WHAT WE USE FOR OUR GUARDS
hCvNibEfOOM_4 0 OUR POINT GUARDS ARE TYPICALLY ONE OF THE SMALLER GUYS IN THE OFFENSE IN OUR SHOOTING GUARDS ARE USUALLY A LITTLE BIT BIGGER
hCvNibEfOOM_5 0 BUT OUR FORWARDS ARE GOING TO BE THE BIG GUYS YOU WANT TO CONCENTRATE ON A SMALL FOR BEING A BIG GUARD THAT CAN SHOOT
hCvNibEfOOM_6 0 SO FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE GOT KYLE HERE WHO IS A TOWEL OR PLAYER IS JUST A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN OUR POST PLAYERS BUT AT THE SAME TIME IS A GOOD OUTSIDE SHOOTER
hCvNibEfOOM_7 0 SO WE CAN USE HIM OUT ON THE WING AS AN OUTSIDE SHOOTER WHAT WE CALL THE SMALL FORWARD POSITION WHICH IS ACTUALLY LIKE ANOTHER BIG GUARD
hCvNibEfOOM_8 0 SOME OFFENSES RUN A THREE GUARD SET SO INSTEAD OF HAVING A SMALL FORWARD THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER GUARD
hCvNibEfOOM_9 0 SO OUR POWER FORWARD SPOT THAT IT IS BASICALLY IF YOUR TEAM IS BLAST LIKE OURS IS WE HAVE A LOT OF BIG POST PLAYERS SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE TWO PLAYERS THAT MIGHT BE CENTERS ONE AS A POWER FORWARD AND ONE AS A CENTER
hCvNibEfOOM_10 0 BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO ARE A POWER FORWARD IS GOING TO BE A GUY THAT CAN POST UP BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE CAN SHOOT FROM THE OUTSIDE AS WELL
hCvNibEfOOM_11 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO USE HIM AS A VERSATILE ROLL WHERE A CENTER IS MORE OF A GUY THAT'S JUST GOING TO PLAY UNDERNEATH AND HE'S GOING TO POST UP AND IT'S GOING TO REBOUND UNDERNEATH
hCvNibEfOOM_12 0 WITH THIS GUY'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE MORE VERSATILE
hCvNibEfOOM_13 0 WE'RE GOING TO RUN HIM FROM SIDE TO SIDE GOING TO RUN HIM OFF SOME SCREENS ALLOW HIM TO COME UP IN THE HIGH POST AREA SHOOT AS WELL
hCvNibEfOOM_14 0 SO WE'VE GOT OUR POWER FORWARD WITH PLATE DOWN LOW MOST THE TIME IN OUR SMALL FORWARDS WHICH ARE GOING TO PLAY ON THE PERIMETER FOURS
hCvNibEfOOM_15 0 THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO FORWARD ROLLS
hd0oFipSBOc_1 0 YOU'VE MADE A GREAT DECISION YOU'RE GOING TO INTERVIEW SOMEONE FOR A PAPER OR A SPEECH OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE YOU NEED RESEARCH MATERIAL FOR
hd0oFipSBOc_2 0 WELL THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO DO IS SAY WHO I AM I GOING TO INTERVIEW

hd0oFipSBOc_4 0 WELL IT'S SOMEONE WHO IS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THE SPECIFIC FIELD THAT THEY ARE IN BUT AN EXPERT CAN BE SOMETHING ELSE AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT IN JUST A SECOND
hd0oFipSBOc_5 0 WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT EXPERT KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THEIR FIELD A MILLION THINGS COME TO MY MIND
hd0oFipSBOc_6 0 FIRST OF ALL I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THE MOST UNTAP SOURCE OF EXPERTS ON THE PLANET
hd0oFipSBOc_7 0 YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS FACULTY MEMBERS AT COLLEGES FACULTY MEMBERS HAVE GONE TO SCHOOL FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS

hd0oFipSBOc_9 0 THEY'VE WRITTEN BOOKS
hd0oFipSBOc_10 0 THEY'VE WRITTEN JOURNAL ARTICLES
hd0oFipSBOc_11 0 THEY ARE AN EXCELLENT SOURCE OF AN EXPERT SO IF YOU HAVE ANY CONNECTIONS TO A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT USING A FACULTY MEMBER FOR YOUR EXPERT TO INTERVIEW UP BUT EXPERTS COULD BE POLITICIANS LAWMAKERS' GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL MEDICAL PERSONNEL THEY ARE EXPERT SET WHAT THEY DO RESEACHERS RELIGIOUS LEADERS COMMUNITY LEADERS THOSE ARE YOUR TOP CHOICES FOR EXPERT FOR MANY MANY MANY SUBJECTS' BUT IN A MINUTE I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE NOT SO OBVIOUS EXPERT

GBPkov2tE1k_2 0 OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HORSES BOOM AND ON THE TRAIL
GBPkov2tE1k_3 0 ALRIGHT AND ALL IN ALL SERIOUS THIS THOUGH I'M I'VE SEEN SOME PRETTY A TERRIBLE ENCOUNTERS WITH THE MOUNTAIN BIKE RIDERS SOME HORSES ARE EQUESTRIANS AND TO IT IT JUST CREATES RED BLOOD BETWEEN BOTH USER GROUPS
GBPkov2tE1k_4 0 WHATEVER YOU COME ACROSS A HORSE ON THE TRAIL YOU NEED TO STOP AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN
GBPkov2tE1k_5 0 THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT YOU'RE ALWAYS IN CONTROL OF YOUR SPADE
GBPkov2tE1k_6 0 NEXT UP AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN YOU STEP UP YOUR BIKE YOU STAND BETWEEN YOUR BIKE AND YOUR CORE AS YOU STEP BETWEEN THE BIKE IN THE HORSE IS THE WHOLE THE HORSE'S PASSING
GBPkov2tE1k_7 0 BEFORE YOU DO THAT SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO JUST DUST EQUESTRIAN RIDER WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO DO
GBPkov2tE1k_8 0 WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO BE
GBPkov2tE1k_9 0 I JUST CUT PUTS THEM IN CONTROL AND SETTLES I'M DONE WITH THEIR UPSET WITH YOU
GBPkov2tE1k_10 0 REMEMBER THE ONES I CAN GET INJURED THEY FALL A LONG WAY OFF THE HORSE WE'RE JUST FALL OFF OR BIKE IF THAT HAPPENS WE MIGHT NEED
GBPkov2tE1k_11 0 REMEMBER WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE OF THE TRAILS ROPE AND EVERYBODY
GwXNlblxiFY_1 0 THERE'S SOME OTHER EARLY ELECTRIC CLOCKS WHICH SHOW MORE AND MORE NOW PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO APPRECIATE ESPECIALLY SINCE PLUGIN CLOCKS PRETTY MUCH OR THING OF THE PASS NOW WITH THE BATTERY CLOCKS TAKING THEIR PLACE
GwXNlblxiFY_2 0 TELECTRON IS REALLY THE COMPANY THAT THAT PERFECTED PLUG IN CLOCKS
GwXNlblxiFY_3 0 BEFORE THAT YOU HAVE THE PROBLEM OF A POWER INTERRUPTIONS
GwXNlblxiFY_4 0 YOUR CLOCK WOODEN RESTART OR I WOULD START AGAIN AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT DOES THEY'RE GOING TO POWER INTERRUPTION WOULD BE SAYING THE WRONG TIME
GwXNlblxiFY_5 0 WHILE THE WORN TELL A CRIME COMPANY TO COORDINATE WITH THE POWER COMPANIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING A SIXTY CYCLE POWER
GwXNlblxiFY_6 0 AND AS LONG AS SIXTY CYCLE POWER CAME THROUGH THE LINES YOUR CLOCK IS GOING TO BE ACCURATE BECAUSE IT WAS GEARED TO TURN IT TO CONVERT THAT SIXTY CYCLE POWER INTO ACCURATE THAT TIME KEEPING AN ELECTRIC CLOCK
GwXNlblxiFY_7 0 THERE'S EARLY ONES IN BEAUTIFUL WOODEN CASES
GwXNlblxiFY_8 0 SO A THEIR ATTRACTIVE TO LOOK AT
GwXNlblxiFY_9 0 OFTEN IF YOU'RE UNSURE ABOUT WHETHER THE TELECTRON ELECTRIC MOTOR IN THERE IS ANY GOOD OR IF IT HAS STEP WORKING THESE CAN BE CONVERTED TO BATTERY
GwXNlblxiFY_10 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE CHORD BUT YOU CAN STILL ENJOY THE AESTHETICS OF THEM OF WE HAVE
GwXNlblxiFY_11 0 THEY WILL GET A BOOK BY GYM LENS ON THESE TELECTRON CLOCKS
GwXNlblxiFY_12 0 SILICON LATER BECAME PARTY GE BUT THEY WITH THOUSANDS OF STYLES AND HE'S ASSIGNED TO CONTEMPORARY COLLECTING THAT I USE TO THEM AS WELL
GwXNlblxiFY_13 0 SO THIS GIVES YOU A GUIDE AT LEAST OF WHICH ONES ARE RARE AND WHICH ONES ARE MORE MORE COMMON
GwXNlblxiFY_14 0 THE FINAL THING TO NOTE IN SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER IN THE PAST TO THAT THESE TELL A CLIENT CAUGHT CLOCKS ALWAYS HAD A LITTLE PORT HOLE IN THE DIAL WHICH WOULD SHOW RED IF THAT IS IF THE POWER HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
GwXNlblxiFY_15 0 THE CLOCK WOULD RESTART BUT AT LEAST YOU KNOW THAT THE CLUB THAT POWER WAS OFF FOR A MINUTE OR FIVE HOURS AND YOU WOULD NO LONGER TRUST THE TIME THAT THE CLOCK SHOWS
GwXNlblxiFY_16 0 AS SOON AS YOU RESET THE CLOCK THAT RED THAT GOES AWAY UNTIL THE NEXT AND THE POWER GOES OFF

GDeyxGoOWnQ_2 0 WHAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT NOW IS WHEN WE USE THE GUARD EFFECTIVELY AS A PULLING GUARD
GDeyxGoOWnQ_3 0 WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE OF A COUPLE THINGS WHEN WE PULL OUR GUARD
GDeyxGoOWnQ_4 0 ONE IS WHEN THIS GUARD PULLS OUT GO AND PLUG YOUR POSITION WHEN HE PULLS OUTSIDE WHEN HE PULLS OUT OF THAT GUARD POSITION THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE A BIG HOLE OPEN ON THIS SIDE
GDeyxGoOWnQ_5 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU PULL THE GUARD THAT YOU EITHER HAVE A RUNNING BACK COMING THROUGH HERE OR THAT THIS TACKLE KNOWS THAT HE'S GOT TO COVER OR WE HAVE A TIGHT END IT'S CRACKING DOWN OR SOMETHING
GDeyxGoOWnQ_6 0 LIKE THAT TO FILL THE SPOT OF THE GUARD

GDeyxGoOWnQ_11 0 WE DON'T WANT THIS GUARD WHEN HE PULLS WE DON'T WANT HIM TO BE IN THE BACKFIELD BECAUSE WE MAY BE BRING IN A RUN RIGHT AHEAD TO HIM
GDeyxGoOWnQ_12 0 ONCE HE GETS BACK IN THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE HE'S GOING TO RUN NINETY DEGREE ANGLE RIGHT DOWN THE LINE AND HE'S GOING TO HIT THE FIRST THING HE SEES IN OPPOSITE COLOR JERSEY

h7XT7qhKU1Q_1 0 SO I'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT LOWER AND THE LIGHT HERE RATHER AND IN THE DARK ABOUT REALLY JUST WANT TO CONTACT SHEET IS
h7XT7qhKU1Q_2 0 CONTACT SHEET IS YOUR NEGATIVES AND YOU LAY THEM ON TOP OF A PIECE OF PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPER THE DARKER
h7XT7qhKU1Q_3 0 AND THEN AFTER THE NEGATIVE ON TOP OF THE PAPER YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A SHEET OF GLASS OR A CONTACT SHEET PRINTER
h7XT7qhKU1Q_4 0 BUT AGAIN THE MOST AFFORDABLE AND JUST USE A NICE QUARTER INCH THICK SHEET OF GLASS
h7XT7qhKU1Q_5 0 WHAT YOU DO IS YOU LAY IT DOWN ON TOP OF THE PAPER
h7XT7qhKU1Q_6 0 LIGHT FROM THE LARGER EXPOSES GO THROUGH YOUR NEGATIVE AND ONTO THE PAPER
h7XT7qhKU1Q_7 0 REALLY PRETTY SIMPLE
h7XT7qhKU1Q_8 0 BUT FOR SOME REASON I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE TIME FACTOR THING
h7XT7qhKU1Q_9 0 I FOUND THAT I'M DOING THIS AND A LOT OF MY STUDENTS LIKE TO JUST LOOK AT THEIR NEGATIVES ON A LIGHT TABLE AND PRINT FROM THEM
h7XT7qhKU1Q_10 0 AND I CAN'T CAN TRY TO TALK PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN OFF
h7XT7qhKU1Q_11 0 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WAY YOU PHOTOGRAPH ON A CONTACT SHEET YOU'LL SEE THE RHYTHM OF YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY

HaQ-wgHagyg_3 0 WHEN I WENT TO JAPAN AND WHEN THE CAREENS ADDED THERE'S THEY BECAME COUNTLESS OTHER VARIATIONS
HaQ-wgHagyg_4 0 AS YOU COULD PROBABLY TELL WITH THE HUMAN LAMB THERE'S ALMOST AN INFINITE NUMBER OF WAYS YOU CAN MOVE IT
HaQ-wgHagyg_5 0 INFINITE NUMBER COMBINATIONS THAT YOU CAN COME UP WITH
HaQ-wgHagyg_6 0 THE ONLY THING STOPPING USING HUMAN MINE
HaQ-wgHagyg_7 0 SO SOME VARIATIONS ART YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOU HAD A CRESCENT KICK WITH THE KICK COMES OUT AND IT COMES OUT SLAPPING ON THE SIDE SIDE OF THE HEAD
HaQ-wgHagyg_8 0 PRESSING KICKS YOU CAN EVEN GO FROM THE OTHER WAY
HaQ-wgHagyg_9 0 IF YOU ADD A SPIN TO THAT IT'S A LITTLE THAT IT'S EASIER TO ACTUALLY GENERATE A LITTLE BIT MORE POWERFUL SPIN PUT IT INTO THE PRESENCE
HaQ-wgHagyg_10 0 FROM THERE YOU ALSO HAVE JUMPY KICKS LIKE I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW YOU JUST THE JUMPING FRONT KICK
HaQ-wgHagyg_11 0 YOU JUST ADD A JUMP TO IT YOU CAN EVEN DOUBLE THE POWER
HaQ-wgHagyg_12 0 YOU ALSO GOT JUMPING SIDE KICK WHICH IS EASY TO RUN IN ACTUALLY LEAP INTO SOMETHING

h28nu6dOPEw_2 0 AND I DECIDE GLUE STICK IS GOING TO WORK BEST FOR THIS PROJECT BECAUSE YOU ARE USING GLASS AND THIS RIBBON OF MATERIAL AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO WORK BEST
h28nu6dOPEw_3 0 NOW WORKING WITH THE GLUE STICK CAN SOMETIMES BE A LITTLE BIT TRICKY BECAUSE SOMETIMES GLUE STICKS CLUMP AND SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE USING A CERTAIN DIRECTION AND THEY THE RIBBON STICKS TOGETHER SO WE'RE GOING TO DO IS PLACE YOUR FINGER ON ONE END AND PUSH AWAY FROM YOURSELF WITH THE GLUE STICK
h28nu6dOPEw_4 0 GO AWAY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND JUST KEEP YOUR FINGERNAIL IN THE AIR AND PUT IT LIKE THAT
h28nu6dOPEw_5 0 I'M GOING TO ACTUALLY PUT THE GLUE ON FIRST AND WE'RE PUTTING THE RIBBONS ON THIS SIDE ON THE FRAME FIRST
h28nu6dOPEw_6 0 AND YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND A LITTLE BIT AND PUSH IN TO PLACE A TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S THE FIRST ONE OVER ON THIS SIDE
h28nu6dOPEw_7 0 AND YOU START FROM ONE AND JUST PRESS LIGHTLY TO MAKE IT STICK TO THE FRAME
h28nu6dOPEw_8 0 AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO OUR NEXT ONE AND PLACE IT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND THE REASON WHY WE'RE PUTTING IT ON THE EACH OF THE SIDES VERSUS BECAUSE THEN WHEN WE PUT OUR RIBBON ON THE TOP IT'S GOING TO CROSS OVER AND MAKE A NICE CORNER AND I LIKE WHEN CORNERS OR THEIR LOOK ALL LIKE WE'VE PLANTED OUT AND WE HAVE
h28nu6dOPEw_9 0 THERE WE GO AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE AT THE BOTTOM AND WHILE I PUT THIS TIME WE'LL START GETTING READY FOR OUR NEXT PROJECT

GnA7s3KLZSg_3 0 NOW THAT WE HAVE THE BATTERY OUT OF THE CAR
GnA7s3KLZSg_4 0 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE BATTERY TRAY HERE AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY SERVICING THAT WE NEED TO DO
GnA7s3KLZSg_5 0 THERE'S A PLASTIC GUARD TO KEEP SOME OF THE BATTERY ACID OFF OF THE METAL TRAIN

GnA7s3KLZSg_7 0 IT'S PRETTY RUSTY IN ANY PAINT IS VANISH LONG AGO
GnA7s3KLZSg_8 0 YOU CAN CLEAN THESE COMPONENTS WITH THE BAKING SODA WATER SOLUTION TO NEUTRALIZE THE ACID
GnA7s3KLZSg_9 0 AND THEN TREAT THE RUST MAYBE WIRE BRUSHING OFF THE LOOSE RUST AND TRYING NOT TO FLUFF IT UP AND SPREAD IT AROUND YOUR ENGINE PART WHICH IS PRETTY ABRASIVE
GnA7s3KLZSg_10 0 RINSING IT DOWN WITH SOME WATER
GnA7s3KLZSg_11 0 CLEAN THIS AREA
GnA7s3KLZSg_12 0 AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S LOTS OF CRUNCHY OLD PAINTS AND NASTY STUFF
GnA7s3KLZSg_13 0 FOR THIS OLD CAR WE'RE JUST GOING TO PUT THE BATTERY AND TRY TO GET TO OUR NEXT DESTINATION
GtLSNycwkR4_1 0 ANOTHER VARIATION OF THE MANUAL IS A MANUAL TO FRONT SIDE <UNK> OUT
GtLSNycwkR4_2 0 THIS IS A GREAT FIRST TRICK TO LEARN

GtLSNycwkR4_6 0 OLLIE ONTO THE TOP ALL THE MANUAL POSITION AND THEN JUST BEFORE YOU GET TO THE END INSTEAD OF ROLLING STRAIGHT OFF OF A FRONT SIDE <UNK> TO FAKIE IS
GtLSNycwkR4_7 0 ONE WAY TO DO THIS IS TO SET UP THE MANUAL POSITION SO THAT YOUR BODY IS TURNED JUST BEFORE YOU WANT TO BE OUT
GtLSNycwkR4_8 0 YOU WANT TO SET UP YOUR UPPER BODY TO ALREADY ALMOST BE WHERE YOU WANT TO LAND IN THE TRICK
GtLSNycwkR4_9 0 YOUR MANUALING AND YOUR UPPER BODY AND YOUR SHOULDERS ARE GOING TO PREDICT THE DIRECTION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TURN
GtLSNycwkR4_10 0 JUST BEFORE YOU GET TO THE END THAT SUGGEST ABOUT SIX INCHES TO A FOOT BEFORE THE AND YOU GET YOUR SHOULDERS ADJUSTED AND THEN FRONT SIDE <UNK> OUT AND LAND FAKIE AND ROLL AWAY
GtLSNycwkR4_11 0 SO YOU OLLIE UP THE MANUAL HIM AND JUST ABOUT SIX INCHES BEFORE THE END YOU ADJUST YOUR WEIGHT
GtLSNycwkR4_12 0 GET YOUR SHOULDERS AND THEN IN THE POSITION THAT YOU WANT TO LAND IN AND FRONT SIDE WITH A AND ROLL AWAY FAKIE
ginkNlt4rgM_1 0 I GUESS I CAN'T GET TO A SERIES ON CLOCK COLLECTING WITH TALKING ABOUT WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT CUCKOO CLOCKS EVEN THOUGH PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE THEM VERY MUCH
ginkNlt4rgM_2 0 AND PROBABLY THAT'S BECAUSE AS A CLOCK REPAIR AND RESTORE THESE CAN BE NIGHTMARES TO WORK ON
ginkNlt4rgM_3 0 THEY'RE THE WORST COMBINATION OF CHEAP AND COMPLICATED WHERE YOU CAN WORK ON A LONG TIME AND STILL HAVE TROUBLE WITH THEM ONCE THEY'VE RUN FOR YEARS AND GOTTEN BADLY WORN INSIDE
ginkNlt4rgM_4 0 BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT THERE A LOT OF FUN WHEN THE WHEN THEY'RE WORKING IN THE BIRD POPS OUT AND CUCKOO'S AND YOU HEAR THE COOL CLING SOUND IN THE GUN BEING
ginkNlt4rgM_5 0 THEY'RE THEY'RE FUN TO WATCH AND THICKLY KIDS LIKE THEM TOO
ginkNlt4rgM_6 0 THEY'RE STILL MAY TODAY
ginkNlt4rgM_7 0 THEIR PRODUCT OF THE BLACK FAR STING GERMANY
ginkNlt4rgM_8 0 SO ANY ANY DISCUSSION OF GERMAN CLOCK MAKING SURE THE BEST INCLUDE CUCKOO CLOCKS
ginkNlt4rgM_9 0 YOU CAN READ MORE ABOUT CUCKOO CLOCKS ALSO ON MY WEBSITE AN ARTICLE MY WIFE ROAD ON THAT SUBJECT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THEM
ginkNlt4rgM_10 0 THIS GIVES YOU KIND OF AN EXAMPLE OF OF THE WHAT'S HAPPENED TO COOK A CLOCK MANUFACTURING
ginkNlt4rgM_11 0 THIS IS AN EARLIER ONE
ginkNlt4rgM_12 0 A LOT OF THESE ARE HAND CARD BUT IN A MASS PRODUCED WAY
ginkNlt4rgM_13 0 YOU CAN SEE BIG GOOD THEN ANIMALS IN BIRDS THE OF RABBITS OF HANGING OFF THE FUNNIER CLOCK WITH THE FANCY CARVINGS UP AND BELOW HERE
ginkNlt4rgM_14 0 SO THIS IS A RELATIVELY EARLY CUCKOO CLOCK
ginkNlt4rgM_15 0 SOME OF THIS STYLE COULD BE THREE FOUR FIVE AND FIVE FEET TALL
ginkNlt4rgM_16 0 SO THEY'RE MASSIVE CARD THINGS WHICH ARE VERY IMPRESSIVE AND THOSE ARE PARTICULARLY VALUABLE
ginkNlt4rgM_17 0 THAT MANY MORE HAVE COME OVER SINCE THEN UP TO THE PRESS AND DAY FROM GERMANY
ginkNlt4rgM_18 0 THEY HAVE ONES LIKE THIS WE HAVE FIGURES THAT AND A SAWING UP THERE IS IS THE VARIOUS GERMAN FOLK TUNES PLAY IN THE BIRD POPS OUT AND WATER WHEELS TURN

hawztAtYHCE_6 0 THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS WE PERCEIVE PAIN IN THE BODY
hawztAtYHCE_7 0 ONE OF THE WAYS IS THROUGH DAMAGE TO THE ANATOMY
hawztAtYHCE_8 0 ANOTHER WAY IS THIS TRACK
hawztAtYHCE_9 0 IF YOU STRETCH SOMETHING TOO FAR YOUR STRETCH RECEPTOR IS GOING TO SEND BACK A MESSAGE THE BRAIN AND SAY HEY DON'T DO THAT IT HURTS
hawztAtYHCE_10 0 SO WHAT THIS DOES IS SOMETIMES WILL MAKE A QUICK MOVEMENT AND THIS STRETCH RECEPTOR GET SET TO TOO SHORT
hawztAtYHCE_11 0 SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE IN NORMAL STRETCH IS SENDING A MESSAGE A BRAIN SAYING HEY DON'T DO THE ARTS

GMerrbORnbk_1 0 NEXT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT'S CALLED A FRONT NOLLIE FRONTSIDE <UNK>
GMerrbORnbk_2 0 REMEMBER AN OLLIE IS WHEN YOU'RE RIDING IN THE SWITCH POSITION BUT FAKIE WHICH MEANS PRETTY MUCH RIDING BACKWARDS SO IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR OPPOSITE FEED ON THIS ONE SO IT'S GOING TO FEEL A LITTLE DIFFICULT AT FIRST BUT YOU KNOW EVENTUALLY YOU BECOME A LITTLE BIT AMBIDEXTROUS AND IT WON'T FEEL SO WEIRD BUT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THIS YOU WANT TO HAVE THE NOLIE PRETTY MUCH DOWN PAT BECAUSE THE FOUNDATION TO THE WHOLE TRICK
GMerrbORnbk_3 0 GET A LITTLE BIT OF SPEED STOMP ON THE NOSE AS YOU STOMP SPIN YOUR BODY THE DIRECTION THAT YOU WANT TO TURN IT ON THIS A NOLLIE FRONTSIDE WHEN IT IS THE SPIN WHERE YOU CAN SEE WHERE YOU'RE TURNING THUS MAKING IT THE EASIER THE TWO BUT IT WHEN YOU INCORPORATE THE PUSHING IN RIDING AROUND IN ALL THE OTHER PARTS OF THIS AN OLLIE ONE EIGHTY THAT YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS
gs-L3zz_KDM_1 0 THE BID NIL
gs-L3zz_KDM_2 0 THEY'LL IS THE STRONGEST WEAPON THAT YOU HAVE IN THE GAME OF SPADES
gs-L3zz_KDM_3 0 BY THE WAY THERE IS ANOTHER BID CALL BLING NIL OR DOUBLE NAILS
gs-L3zz_KDM_4 0 DOUBLE NIL IS A BID DESIGN PRIMARILY AND THAT'S NOT THIS HAND BUT THE DOUBLE THAT WAS DESIGNED PRIMARILY TO HELP RESCUE A LAST GAME
gs-L3zz_KDM_5 0 IN OTHER WORDS YOU LOSING BY TWO HUNDRED POINTS AND YOU THROW UPWARDS CALL YOU THROW OUT OR HIT THE PERSON YOU THROW OUT WHAT'S CALLED A BLIND MILK
gs-L3zz_KDM_6 0 LINE NIL BID NIL FORGET THIS HAND FOR THE MOMENT SUPPOSING THAT THIS WAS YOUR HAND WHEN YOU GET A BLIND NIL YOU'RE TELLING THE COMPUTER THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LOOK AT YOUR HAND WHICH I HOPE YOU SHOW DON'T HAVE THE ACE OF SPADES IN YOUR HAND
gs-L3zz_KDM_7 0 BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE THE ACE OF SPADES OR A BAD ACE AND HAND YOU'RE GOING TO GET SET INSTANTLY
gs-L3zz_KDM_8 0 ANOTHER WHICH YOU DON'T GET TO SEE YOUR CARDS BUT YOU MAKE THIS ATTEMPT TO TAKE TWO HUNDRED POINTS AND IF YOU TURN YOUR HAND OR WHAT WE WILL YOU KNOW YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS YOU SAY OH MY GOD I'VE SET
gs-L3zz_KDM_9 0 I CANNOT MAKE THIS NAIL
gs-L3zz_KDM_10 0 SO I DON'T EVEN PLAY GAMES A BLIND NILS
gs-L3zz_KDM_11 0 WE DON'T ALLOW THEM IN THE TOURNAMENTS AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ONLINE DON'T LIKE TO USE THEM BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE A GAME STOLEN FROM THEM BECAUSE SOMEBODY GOING INCREDIBLY LUCKY
gs-L3zz_KDM_12 0 SO THE BLIND NIL BID THAT IS A BIT OF DESPERATION
gs-L3zz_KDM_13 0 A STANDARD NIL REWARD YOU WITH ONE HUNDRED POINTS IF YOU SUCCESSFULLY MAKE THAT BID
gs-L3zz_KDM_14 0 NOW LET'S LOOK AT THIS HAND
gs-L3zz_KDM_15 0 YOU DO HAVE THE ACE OF CLUBS BUT YOU HAVE THREE SMALL ONES SO THE PROBABILITY OF YOU'RE MAKING THIS BIT A PRETTY GOOD
gs-L3zz_KDM_16 0 PARTICULARLY SINCE YOU HAVE THE DEUCE AND THE FIVE AND IN THE EIGHT
gs-L3zz_KDM_17 0 I MEAN CHANCES ARE THE OPPONENTS THE ONLY WAY THAT THIS BUILD THIS BID WOULD BE SET WITH THIS ACES THAT ONE UPON WOULD HAVE TO HAVE KING QUEEN JACK TEN OR SOMETHING OF THAT IT'LL
gs-L3zz_KDM_18 0 YOUR PARTNER WOULD HAVE TO HAVE FOUR MIDDLE SPOTS AND YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE ONE AND AVOID IT JUST KEEPS PROBABLY THROUGH YOUR RACE
gs-L3zz_KDM_19 0 CHANCES ARE THAT YOUR PARTNER WILL BE TRUMPING THE FOURTH ONTO THIS SUIT
gs-L3zz_KDM_20 0 THIS HARD SUIT IS COMPLETELY SAFE
gs-L3zz_KDM_21 0 THE SINGLE THAN DIAMOND IS GOOD
gs-L3zz_KDM_22 0 THE ONLY RISK FACTOR IN THIS NIL IS THIS KIND OF SPADES
gs-L3zz_KDM_23 0 THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO SMALLER SPADES WITH IT IS VERY ENCOURAGING BECAUSE EITHER YOUR PARTNER COULD HAVE THE JACK QUEEN KING OR ACE OF SPADES WHICH IS ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT PROBABILITY
gs-L3zz_KDM_24 0 AS THIS IS SO MANY PROBABILITIES IN THE GAME
gs-L3zz_KDM_25 0 BY THE WAY THE HIGHER YOUR PARTNER BIDS THE MORE LIKELY THAT HE HAS WOULD TRUMP
gs-L3zz_KDM_26 0 IF YOUR PARTNER'S BIDDING SIX
gifS1Kv9nCQ_1 0 NEXT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO AN OLLIE FRONTSIDE ONCE THE OFF OF A LEDGE
gifS1Kv9nCQ_2 0 THIS TYPE OF AN OLLIE ONE EIGHTY IS THE EASIER WHEN TO PERFORM THAT YOU CAN SEE WHERE YOU'RE SPINNING

gifS1Kv9nCQ_6 0 STOMP ON THE TAIL WILL MAKE THE DIFFERENT IS GOING TO START YOUR FREE SPIN TOWARDS YOUR FRONT FOOT BEFORE YOU START NOLLYING
gifS1Kv9nCQ_7 0 AS YOU NOLIE TURN YOUR UPPER BODY TOWARDS THE FRONT FOOT SO THE REST OF THE BOARD WILL SPIN THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES
gifS1Kv9nCQ_8 0 AND ONCE YOU'VE MADE THE FULL ROTATION JUST WANT TO LINE UP AS STRAIGHT AS POSSIBLE SO THAT YOU CAN WIN CLEANLY
gifS1Kv9nCQ_9 0 AND AGAIN IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS TRICK ON A LEDGE THAT YOU NEED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION TAKE OFF ROOM
gifS1Kv9nCQ_10 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO GET TOO CLOSE TO THE LEDGE BECAUSE CLOSE YOU GET THE MORE ON EVEN YOUR BOARD'S GOING TO TAKE OFF IN THE MORNING WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO LAND

gUKDEgVCQN8_8 0 IN THIS CASE EMMA BEGINS PREPARING HER ATTACK AND AS SHE DOES SHE IS HITTING THE HEAD
gUKDEgVCQN8_9 0 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE HEAD OF COURSE WHICH IS A WAY
gUKDEgVCQN8_10 0 THIS TIME RACHEL MAKES THE ATTACK OR RATHER THE PREPARATION AND I'M A WILL ATTACK AS SHE COMES FORWARD
gUKDEgVCQN8_11 0 LET'S TRY IT AGAIN WITH THE GOLD BE HITTING BEFORE THEY BEGIN EXTENDING THEIR OWN
gUKDEgVCQN8_13 0 IT DOESN'T MATTER
gUKDEgVCQN8_15 0 AGAIN HITTING HER IN PREPARATION AS SHE'S MOVING FOR
HG9mwh7aAfM_1 0 OKAY WELL CORONAL POLISHING IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE DONE
HG9mwh7aAfM_2 0 SO WHAT IT DOES IT TAKE IT CLEANS ALL THE HARDER AND THE CALCULUS FROM THE GUM LINE OF THE TOOTH ALL THE WAY TO THE TIP OF THE TOOTH
HG9mwh7aAfM_3 0 THE GUM LINE OF THE TIP OF THE TOOTH IS CALLED THE CROWN OR THE CORONAL THUS THE NAME CORONAL POLISH
HG9mwh7aAfM_4 0 NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS IS WHEN A PERSON JUST TO DAY TO DAY WEAR AND TEAR IT EATING DRINKING YOU KNOW BREATHING THEY START BUILDING UP EXCESS BACTERIA AND HARDER AND CALCULUS ON THESE TEETH THAT JUST BRUSHING AND FLOSSING ALONG WILL NOT REMOVE
HG9mwh7aAfM_5 0 SO OBVIOUSLY THE BENEFITS FOR CORONAL POLISHING IS TO REMOVE THIS AND ALSO HAVE A BETTER FOUNDATION FOR SOME SUPER DUPER HELP THE GUMS
HG9mwh7aAfM_6 0 NOW MOST THE TIME A DEMO DENTIST OR A DENTAL HYGIENE AND THIS WILL DO THE CORONAL POLISHING
HG9mwh7aAfM_7 0 MOST PEOPLE USUALLY HAVE TO GET IT DONE ONCE EVERY SIX MONTHS SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE TO GET IT DONE MORE TIMES BECAUSE GENETICALLY THEY BUILD UP A MORE OF A BACTERIA AND THEY HAVE TO DEAD EVERY THREE MONTHS OR ONE MONTH
HG9mwh7aAfM_8 0 THIS IS THE TIME YOU CAN PLAY YOUR MOTHER AND BOTHER BECAUSE THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S IN YOUR JEANS THAT YOU HAVE TO BUILD UP THIS TARTAR CONTROL AND EVERYTHING ELSE LIKE THAT
HG9mwh7aAfM_9 0 SO THE AND THAT'S WHAT THE FOUNDATION IS ON THE CURL POLISH
gLn7ARrCQ6w_1 0 ONCE YOU'VE REALLY LEARN HOW TO RIDE FAKIE VERY WELL ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE A WHOLE NEW OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT TRICKS
gLn7ARrCQ6w_2 0 THE KEY TO GETTING INTO THOSE TRICKS A LOT OF THE TIME THOSE LEARNING HOW TO DO A ONE EIGHTY AND WITHOUT DOING A ONE EIGHTY YOUR FAKIE SKILLS ARE ALMOST USELESS IN A LOT OF CASES
gLn7ARrCQ6w_3 0 YOU KNOW MUCH LIKE A BUNNY HOP MOST PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO DO ONE EIGHTIES PICKING UP BOTH WHEELS OF THE SAME TIME AND WHIPPING THE BIKE AROUND AS FAST AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN AND LANDING BACKWARDS
gLn7ARrCQ6w_4 0 WHAT'S REALLY IS NOT THE OPTIMAL WAY TO DO IT BECAUSE THEN ONCE AGAIN ONCE YOU START BY TAKING IT TO MORE ADVANCED STAGES OF DOING ONE EIGHTIES FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE GOING TO ONE EIGHTY DOWN SOME STAIRS OR YOU ARE GOING TO ONE EIGHTY OVER A JUMP SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU HAVE A LOT LESS CONTROL OVER THE TRICK
gLn7ARrCQ6w_5 0 SO BASICALLY YOU KNOW ONCE YOU WANT TO START TAKING YOUR ONE EIGHTIES TO ALL SORTS OF NEW AVENUES THAT YOU THAT YOU HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT BEFORE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MUCH LIKE A BUNNY HOP YOUR ONE EIGHTY START WITH YOUR FRONT WHEEL COMING UP
gLn7ARrCQ6w_6 0 BUT YOU WANT TO START LOOKING INTO YOUR INSIDE SHOULDER WHICHEVER WAY YOU NATURALLY WANT TO SPIN AND AS YOU AS YOU COME IN YOU POP AND YOU PUSH THE BIKE THROUGH AT BUT YOU MAKE SURE TO KEEP LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER BECAUSE YOUR YOUR BODY BASICALLY WILL FOLLOW WHEREVER YOU LOOK SO AS LONG AS YOU KEEP LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LAND JUST FINE
gLn7ARrCQ6w_7 0 IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SPIN A COMPLETE ONE EIGHTY BECAUSE ONCE YOU START LEARNING THEM YOU'LL CARRY MUCH BETTER SPEED RIDING OUT BACKWARDS IF YOU SPIN IT REALLY A COMPLETE ONE EIGHTY RATHER THAN SPINNING YOU KNOW HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES OR SO WHERE YOU BASICALLY YOU'RE GOING TO LAND IN A COMPLETE STOP
GWCJn50YQoY_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT YOUR AVERAGE PLAYER OR YOUR ABOVE THOSE THAT IS BY THE AVERAGE PLAYER TRYING TO GET INTO THE SPIN SEVERAL TRYING TO LEARN MORE OF A VARIETY OF THINGS ARE WITH MORE VARIETY AND ALLOW YOURSELF TO DO THAT IS THE GRIP IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT

GWCJn50YQoY_6 0 THE DOUBLE NUMBER ONE IS UP
GWCJn50YQoY_7 0 YOU ALWAYS WANT TO REMEMBER THAT
GWCJn50YQoY_8 0 SO WHAT WE FIND IS FIND THE MOST PLAYERS WE USE ALMOST A FOREHAND GRIP
GWCJn50YQoY_9 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO DO AN EASTERN GRIP RIGHT HERE WHICH IS A FOREHAND GRIP
GWCJn50YQoY_10 0 AND WE FOREHAND GRIP UNLESS FOREHAND

GVMmatnTe_Q_1 0 I'M COOIE GRAY LAVENDER AND IN THIS CLIP I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO GLUE DOWN THE MATERIALS YOU'RE USING IN YOUR MOSAIC STEPPING STONES
GVMmatnTe_Q_2 0 WHEN YOU'RE DONE AND FEEL SATISFIED WITH THE DESIGN YOU HAVE YOU'VE PLAYED YOUR TILES OUT THEN YOU MIX UP YOUR THINSET
GVMmatnTe_Q_3 0 YOU CAN BUY IT AT ANY HARDWARE STORE BIO STORE
GVMmatnTe_Q_4 0 IT'S A FINE POWDER AND IT'S THE MORTAR THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE AS A GLUE
GVMmatnTe_Q_5 0 YOU MIX THE POWDER WITH A LITTLE BIT OF WATER AND YOU WANT IT ABOUT THE CONSISTENCY OF PEANUT BUTTER
GVMmatnTe_Q_6 0 AFTER YOU MIX IT IF YOU LET IT SIT FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES
GVMmatnTe_Q_7 0 BECAUSE IT IS A CONCRETE IT HAS TO HAVE THERE'S A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT HAS TO HAPPEN SO IT HAS TO SET UP FOR A FEW MINUTES
GVMmatnTe_Q_8 0 ONCE YOU'VE GOT IT SET UP THAT WAY YOU WANT IT AND YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY IS THE LITTLE THIN AND A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR THEM TO GET ALL THE LUMPS OUT LET IT SIT
GVMmatnTe_Q_9 0 YOU CAN DO THIS WHILE YOU'RE IN YOUR FINAL THIS DESIGN STAGE SO IT'S ALL READY TO GO
GVMmatnTe_Q_10 0 AFTER IT SETS UP I TAKE AN OLD BUTTER KNIFE AND YOU TAKE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF GLUE PICK UP THE TILE LITTLE PIECE OF GLUE OF THE THINSET
GVMmatnTe_Q_11 0 AGAIN YOU DON'T WANT TO COVER UP TOO MUCH BECAUSE YOU NEED TO LEAVE ROOM FOR YOUR GROUT
GVMmatnTe_Q_12 0 GENTLY PLACE IT IN PLACE AND MOVE ON
GVMmatnTe_Q_13 0 THE OTHER WAY TO DO IT IS ACTUALLY PUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT DOWN ON THE TILE ITSELF FIRST PUT THE PIECE OVER IT AND MAKE GIVE IT GENTLY PRESS IN
GVMmatnTe_Q_14 0 IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH WAY YOU DO IT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A GOOD ADHESION WITH THE TILE
GVMmatnTe_Q_15 0 THEN YOU LET AFTER YOU'VE GLUED YOUR WHOLE PIECE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING THAT WAY YOU WANT IT YOU HAVE TO LET IT SIT IN HERE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS
GVMmatnTe_Q_16 0 REMEMBER TO MIX THE THINSET LET IT SET UP FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES THEN REMIX IT
GVMmatnTe_Q_17 0 THEN YOU CAN APPLY YOUR TILES AND VARIOUS PIECES TO YOU'RE STEPPING STONE WITH THE THINSET THEN LET IT HERE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE YOU GROUT
hbq9TOm0q5s_1 0 HOW DO YOU KILL FLEAS
hbq9TOm0q5s_2 0 WELL THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO KILL FLEAS ARE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE AND EASILY A EASILY GOTTEN A LOCAL PET STORE
hbq9TOm0q5s_3 0 IT ON MY CARD HERE I HAVE A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF THERE'S YOUR TOPICAL OINTMENTS WHICH ARE MY PREFERRED USAGE FOR FOR KILLING AND PREVENTING FLEAS
hbq9TOm0q5s_4 0 I KNOW IN VERY BAD INFESTATIONS THESE HAVE TO BE USED IN CAN JUNCTURE WITH THINGS LIKE THE HOT POWDERS IN THE AIR ASPHALT STALL SPRAYS IN THE BOTTOMS
hbq9TOm0q5s_5 0 WHAT I DO NOT FOR THE BOMBS MYSELF I DON'T THINK THEY WORK ALL THAT WELL AND THEY'RE KIND OF INTRUSIVE INTO YOUR HOME THE VELOCITY TO DO TO DO A BOMB
hbq9TOm0q5s_6 0 THE AEROSOL SPRAYS ARE MUCH MUCH MORE DIRECT YOU CAN GET THEM EXACTLY THE PLACES YOU WANT TO GET THEM IN AND OUT AND THAT THEY'RE EASY TO CONTROL AND USE AS OUR THE POWDERS
hbq9TOm0q5s_7 0 BUT YOUR FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE IS GOING TO BE SOME SORT OF TOPICAL OINTMENT
hbq9TOm0q5s_8 0 NOW THESE ARE OINTMENTS THEY'RE GOING TO GO IN BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES ON THE ANIMAL
hbq9TOm0q5s_9 0 YOU SPREAD THE FOR OUT AND BE APPLY THEM
hbq9TOm0q5s_10 0 THEY ARE SPECIES SPECIFIC SO THERE'S A DOG IS A CAT AND THEY ARE WEIGHT SPECIFIC THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN WEIGHT GROUPS
hbq9TOm0q5s_11 0 LIKE FOR INSTANCE THIS ONE ISN'T SIXTEEN THE THIRTY POUNDS AND THIS ONE ISN'T FOR THE SIX TO SIXTY POUNDS
hbq9TOm0q5s_12 0 SO IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN BUYING THAT THE THE THE OINTMENT THAT YOU KNOW THE POUNDS OF YOUR ANIMAL
hbq9TOm0q5s_13 0 YOU CAN BUY THESE FROM YOUR VET AND YOU CAN BUY THESE ALSO FROM YOUR LOCAL PET STORE
hbq9TOm0q5s_14 0 I PREFER THE FRONT LAND LOOK BROUGHT BRAND FRONTLINE BRAND THAT YOU WORK THE BEST IN MY OPINION OVER THE YEARS OR THEY THEY CAUSE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF EFFECT THAT I HAVE EVER HAD ANY BAD REACTIONS ON THE FRONT LINE
hbq9TOm0q5s_15 0 BUT IF YOU WEAR THESE ALL ARE ALL PESTICIDE PRODUCTS IN ONE FORM OF ANOTHER AND YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN USING THEM ESPECIALLY WITH THE TOPICAL OINTMENTS
hbq9TOm0q5s_16 0 ONCE YOU'VE USER TOPICAL OINTMENT WHETHER IT WORKS OR NOT YOU CAN NOT APPLY ANOTHER ONE FOR THE MONTH
hbq9TOm0q5s_17 0 BECAUSE THAT IS THE EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME
hbq9TOm0q5s_18 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO BE TOPICAL IMAGES ADVISE AND NOT TO FLEA BATH THE ANIMAL OR FLEA DIP THE ANIMAL OR SPRAY THE ANIMAL THAT ANY OTHER KIND OF FLEA PRODUCT
hbq9TOm0q5s_19 0 AGAIN IS A PESTICIDE AND YOU CAN POUR IT IN YOUR ANIMAL NOT USED CORRECTLY ALWAYS READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS ON YOUR PACKAGING AND FALL THEM TO THE TEE
G54hHUfnbK8_1 0 FOR THIS SECTION WE'RE GOING TO START LOOKING AT KINKY OR SWORD FORM ONE
G54hHUfnbK8_2 0 WE'LL DRAW THE FIRST MOTION FOR THIS TECHNIQUE IS SHOMEN UCHI IS THE OVERHEAD STRIKE
G54hHUfnbK8_3 0 I COME UP THROUGH MY CENTER AND I CUT WITH A GOOD SHOMEN
G54hHUfnbK8_4 0 A GOOD SHOMEN IS PROJECTING IS LEADING THE TIP OF THE SWORD OUT AND AWAY
G54hHUfnbK8_5 0 IT'S AS IF I'M CASTING THE SWORD
G54hHUfnbK8_6 0 SO I'M HERE TO COME UP ON CUT
G54hHUfnbK8_7 0 GOOD MOVEMENT FROM CENTER CASTING THE TIP AS IF YOU'RE AN APPLE OR SOME PIECE OF FRUIT ON THE END OF YOUR SORTED YOU'RE LOOKING AT OFF
G54hHUfnbK8_8 0 I COME UP CUT
G54hHUfnbK8_10 0 WE WANT TO HAVE HARMONY BETWEEN THE DROP OF THE BLADE IS IN THE CENTER IN OF MY OF MY MOTION HERE
G54hHUfnbK8_11 0 AS MY BODY COMES TO POSITION THE SWORD COMES IN POSITION
G54hHUfnbK8_12 0 THEY COME TOGETHER SIMULTANEOUSLY
G54hHUfnbK8_13 0 THAT'S FOR THE POWER'S AT
G54hHUfnbK8_14 0 IF IT GETS DISCOMBOBULATED MY HIPS ARE THERE FIRST SO THE SWORD THEIR FIRST WE LOSE ALL THE POWER OF THE STRIKE
G54hHUfnbK8_16 0 THAT'S THE FIRST PORTION OF KING YOU WANT
hDQPbIIXONo_1 0 HI THIS IS BRUCE LESSELS FROM ZOAR OUTDOOR FOR EXPERT VILLAGE DOT COM TALKING ABOUT CAMPING
hDQPbIIXONo_2 0 WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN AT NIGHT IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOME WAY TO SEE AND I'M GOING TO GO ABOUT DOING TASK SUCH AS COOKING AND WE AND PUTTING YOUR PUTTING YOUR STUFF TO BED AT NIGHT AND SETTING UP YOUR TENT IF YOU NEED TO IN AND THE DARK
hDQPbIIXONo_3 0 SO AHEAD LAMP IS A GOOD WAY TO DO THAT THEY MAKE SOME REALLY NICE HAVE LAMPS NOWADAYS THIS IS A ALLEY D HAVE LAMP THAT HAS A ROTATING BULB SO YOU CAN CHANGE THE ANGLE OF IT
hDQPbIIXONo_4 0 IT KEEPS YOUR HANDS FREE AND ALLOWS YOU TO CONCENTRATE ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH YOUR HANDS AND DOG IS ENOUGH LIGHT THAT YOU CAN REALLY SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING
hDQPbIIXONo_5 0 IF YOU WANT TO USE THE SORT OF MORE DIFFUSE LIGHT AND YOU WANT TO WAIT IT'S EASY TO REHEAT OR TO TO DO EITHER TASKS AT NIGHT PROPANE LANTERN IS A GREAT WAY TO GO AND THESE OF COURSE ARE BIGGER AND HARDER TO CARRYING A BACKPACK BUT IF YOU'RE EITHER CANOE CAMPING OR A CAR CAMPING PROPANE LANTERN CAN BE A GREAT OPTION AND CAN GIVE YOU PLENTY OF LIGHT AROUND THE CAMP FIRE AT THE TABLE OR JUST OUTSIDE READING IN THE LAST FEW HOURS A DAY
GJNxi_ipEio_1 0 WE WOULD TALK WITH THE MEDICINE BALL IS IS A VARIATION OF THE WOOD SHOP MOLD
GJNxi_ipEio_2 0 IF YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT ELSE I'VE DONE WITH IT JUST FEEL FREE TO BROWSE AROUND AND FOR THE WOOD SHOP WITH OR SITTING ON THE BALL OR STANDING INHALE DIFFERENT OF THE DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF THE MOVES THAT YOU CAN GET IT ON THE BOARD LIKE THAT YOU NOW
GJNxi_ipEio_3 0 SO NOW I HAVE A FOUR POUND BALL
GJNxi_ipEio_4 0 AND I LIKE TO START LOWER AND THEY WORK MY WAY UP BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE HEAVIER BALL IF YOU DROP IT YOU CAN GET HURT
GJNxi_ipEio_5 0 NOW THE IDEA HERE WITH THE MORE WITH MY SO FROM THE FEET UP
GJNxi_ipEio_6 0 YOUR FEET ARE SHOULDER WIDTH APART TOES SLIGHTLY OUT KNEES ARE SLIGHTLY BENT AND THE HIPS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT
GJNxi_ipEio_7 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CUT THOSE HIPS MEANING HIP BONES ARE COMING TOWARDS YOUR YOUR RIBS
GJNxi_ipEio_8 0 SO TAKE SHORTENING THE DISTANCE HERE IN THE ABDOMINAL AREA
GJNxi_ipEio_9 0 I'M OR LIKE SOMEBODY'S SPLITTING THE FRONT OF YOUR PIN IS YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR SIPPER SEE IF EVERYTHING IS OK THERE SO THAT'S THE MOVE RIGHT HERE
GJNxi_ipEio_10 0 KEEP YOUR ABS TUCKED IN SO SUCKING IN THAT ABDOMINAL WALL OR THAT BELLY BUTTON TOWARDS THE SPINE
GJNxi_ipEio_11 0 SHOULDERS DOWN AND THE CHEST IS UP AN OPEN
GJNxi_ipEio_12 0 SO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS MOLD THAT THE SHOULDERS TO WANT TO DO THE ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE POSTURAL ISSUES THAT MAYBE ONE TO HAPPEN
GJNxi_ipEio_13 0 SO BE AWARE OF THAT
GJNxi_ipEio_14 0 NOW WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE TWIST JUST LIKE YOU HAVE AN ACTING YOU'RE CHOPPING WOULD YOU TO DO THE SAME THING WITH THE BALL AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME ACROSS THE BODY
GJNxi_ipEio_15 0 AS I'M DOING THAT NOTICE THAT MY HIPS ARE STAYING FRONT MY HIPS ARE NOT MOVING
GJNxi_ipEio_16 0 I'M MOVING THE UPPER BODY AND GOING DOWN ACROSS LIKE AN X
GJNxi_ipEio_17 0 GOING OVER AND UP AND DOWN
GJNxi_ipEio_18 0 IF THIS BOTHERS YOUR SHOULDERS AS A SIGN THAT SOMETHING IS GOING ON YOU CAN KEEP IT RIGHT HERE IN OUR GO SO FAR LOW
GJNxi_ipEio_19 0 THE IDEA IS TO GET THAT TWIST IN THERE TO WORK THE MIDDLE OF THE BODY
GJNxi_ipEio_20 0 YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT TO THE OTHER SIDE KEEPING THE BELLY BUTTON ALWAYS STEADY FACING FRONT KEEPING THAT TUCK
GJNxi_ipEio_21 0 BEFORE YOU KNOW IT YOU'LL BE VERY STRONG AND HOPEFULLY YOU'LL BE COMING BACK FOR MORE
GJNxi_ipEio_22 0 YOU'LL SEE ITS OWN
GjvD6mWI2aE_1 0 HI I'M MIKE LOPEZ WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'LL BE DISCUSSING HERE ESCAPE AND ITS EXPANSION SETS
GjvD6mWI2aE_2 0 AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER PUTTING YOUR WELL TOGETHER
GjvD6mWI2aE_3 0 PUTTING YOUR WALL TOGETHER CONSISTS OF PUTTING PIECES TOGETHER AND AS WE SEE HERE WE HAVE TO STRAIGHTEN PIECES THAT HAVE GROOVES ON EQUAL AND OPPOSITE SIDES AND WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO MATCH THE GROOVES ON THE SIDES OF AND SLIDE THEM TOGETHER
GjvD6mWI2aE_4 0 ONCE AGAIN MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE GROOVE SIDE BECAUSE IF YOU DO NOT IN YOUR PIECES WILL NOT SLIDE TOGETHER
GjvD6mWI2aE_5 0 SO YOU WOULD TAKE THE PIECES AND IT WILL MATCH THE GROOVES UP AND SLIDE THEM TOGETHER LIKE SO
GjvD6mWI2aE_6 0 ONCE AGAIN MAKE SURE THAT YOU MATCH THEM UP CORRECTLY BECAUSE AS WE SEE HERE THERE'S A SPACE
GjvD6mWI2aE_7 0 SO A LITTLE PART AGAIN AND MAKE SURE TO PUT SOME ALL THE WAY TO GET IT SO THERE'S NO SPACE IN BETWEEN THEM AND THEN YOU WILL TAKE THE BOTTOM PIECES THAT ARE HEXAGONAL MASS THEM UP TO THE NEXT SEGMENT PIECES ON YOUR GAME BOARD
GjvD6mWI2aE_8 0 AND THAT IS THE BEGINNING OF YOUR WALL
gU2a1iWlJNA_1 0 ALRIGHT FIRST THING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT BOUNCE JUGGLING IS WHAT KIND OF ALL THESE
gU2a1iWlJNA_2 0 THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT ONES THAT YOU CAN USE
gU2a1iWlJNA_3 0 I LIKE TO USE LACROSSE BALLS
gU2a1iWlJNA_4 0 YOU CAN GET THEM PRETTY MUCH ANY SPORTING GOOD STORE AND THEY'RE REALLY CHEAP
gU2a1iWlJNA_5 0 THEY DON'T LAST FOREVER AND AS YOU CAN SEE THEY WILL GET STAINED AND YOU CAN'T REALLY EVER GET THEM TO BE THE ORIGINAL COLOR THAT THEY WERE AGAIN
gU2a1iWlJNA_6 0 BUT YOU'RE CONSIDERING YOUR OTHER OPTION IS REALLY A A SILICONE JUGGLING BALL THAT RUN ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY TO FIFTY DOLLARS A PIECE
gU2a1iWlJNA_7 0 THEY DON'T BOUNCE AS WELL BUT I THINK THE PRICE MAKES UP FOR
gU2a1iWlJNA_8 0 THE OTHER THING THAT YOU NEED IS SEGMENT
gU2a1iWlJNA_9 0 SOME PEOPLE USE A SLAB OF MARBLE THAT THEY GET BECAUSE IT'S PERFECTLY SMOOTH AND PERFECTLY FLAT
gU2a1iWlJNA_10 0 BUT I WOULD USE ABOUT I WOULD SAY SIDEWALKS CEMENT WITHOUT ANY BIG YOU KNOW ABOUT DIVOTS TAKEN OUT OF IT OR ANYTHING IS A GOOD PLACE BECAUSE YOU NEED A GOOD YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT WHICH WAY THE BALL IS GOING TO BOUNCE BACK UP
gU2a1iWlJNA_11 0 I WOULD ALSO STEER CLEAR FOR OF BLACK TOP BECAUSE IT'S TO HITTING BUT ONCE YOU HAVE THOSE THINGS SQUARED AWAY YOU'RE READY TO START BOUNCE JUGGLING
GZSOTSSh1hU_1 0 SO NOW THAT WE HAVE OUR GLAZED MIX WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY
GZSOTSSh1hU_2 0 THE ORIGINAL AN OLD FASHIONED METHOD OF DOING THIS BY THE WAY THIS IS MY LARGE COMMERCIAL SPIN
GZSOTSSh1hU_3 0 WHEN YOU MIX THIS GLAZE YOU WANT TO PULL FROM THE BOTTOM AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE BRINGING EVERYTHING AROUND
GZSOTSSh1hU_4 0 THE WAY TO TEST THE THICKNESS OF YOUR GLAZE IS TO PUT A FINGER IN THERE AND JUST SEE IF IT BREAKS ON THE FOLDS OF YOUR KNUCKLES
GZSOTSSh1hU_5 0 AND IT SHOULD BE THICK AROUND YOUR FINGER AND BREAKING ON THE FOLDS OF YOUR KNUCKLES
GZSOTSSh1hU_6 0 THAT'S ABOUT THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY FOR GLAZE
GZSOTSSh1hU_7 0 NOW THAT'S NOT A COMPLETELY FULL PROOF WAY OF TESTING THE CONSISTENCY OF YOUR GLAZE
GZSOTSSh1hU_8 0 THE ONLY WAY TO BE A HUNDRED PERCENT CERTAIN IS TO USE A HYDROMETER
GZSOTSSh1hU_9 0 LIKE I SAID THIS MEASURES THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE GLAZE WHICH IS THE AMOUNT OF WATER IN THIS MIXTURE
GZSOTSSh1hU_10 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO MIX THIS UP VERY WELL
GZSOTSSh1hU_11 0 THIS GLAZE DOES SETTLE OUT RATHER QUICKLY SO EVERY TIME YOU'RE GOING TO DO ANYTHING WITH THAT YOU'RE GOING TO STIR IT
GZSOTSSh1hU_12 0 YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR SPONGE GET IT JUST BARELY MOIST AND WIPE OFF YOUR HYDROMETER
GZSOTSSh1hU_13 0 YOU DON'T WANT THE HYDROMETER WET BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT TO STICK EITHER
GZSOTSSh1hU_14 0 AND THEN YOU JUST DROP THIS RIGHT IN THERE GENTLY AND LET IT FALL UNTIL IT STOPS FALLING
GZSOTSSh1hU_15 0 AND ONCE IT'S SETTLES YOU CAN TAP THE SIDE OF THE BUCKET JUST GENTLY AND THAT CAN URGE IT TO ITS FINAL POSITION
GZSOTSSh1hU_16 0 ONCE IT'S SADDLES YOU LOOK AND SEE WHERE THE TOP OF THE MINUTES GETS IS ON THE HYDROMETER
GZSOTSSh1hU_17 0 AND THAT TELLS YOU THE READING
GZSOTSSh1hU_18 0 IN THIS CASE WE'VE GOT FOURTEEN TWENTY WHICH IS JUST RIGHT FOR THIS PARTICULAR GLAZE
GZSOTSSh1hU_19 0 USUALLY BETWEEN FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN FIFTY IS A HYDROMETER READING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR IN STONEWARE PLACES
GgiaPMSLOi0_1 0 HI THIS IS JON ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE IN THIS VIDEO CLIP WE WILL BE INSTALLING THE TOP
GgiaPMSLOi0_2 0 AFTER INSTALLING THE BOTTOM PIECE I WENT AHEAD AND FLIPPED UP MY CHEST OF DRAWERS UP ONTO THE WORKBENCH THIS WILL REALLY HELP WHEN INSTALLING THE TOP
GgiaPMSLOi0_3 0 THE FIRST THING THAT YOU NEED TO DO IS DRY FIT THE TOP SO JUST GO AHEAD AND SET THAT IN PLACE AND MAKE SURE ALL OF YOUR MEASUREMENTS WE'RE CORRECT EVERYTHING LOOKS PRETTY GOOD
GgiaPMSLOi0_4 0 NEXT WE WILL GO AHEAD AND GLUE IT PLACE OUR TOP ON THERE MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS FLUSH AND WHERE WE WANT IT TO BE
GgiaPMSLOi0_5 0 AND THEN INHALE IT IN PLACE ONCE OUR TOP IS DONE I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE A SQUARE AND MAKE SURE THAT MY CABINET IS SQUARE
GgiaPMSLOi0_6 0 IF IT'S NOT YOU WANT TO BEND IT UNTIL IT BECOMES SQUARE SO THAT WHEN THE GLUE DRIES EVERYTHING WILL LINE UP
hJPX0grNGho_1 0 HI THIS IS JEREMY HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
hJPX0grNGho_2 0 I'M HERE TO SHOW YOU SOME MORE ABOUT THE DIFFERENT BALLOON VARIETIES
hJPX0grNGho_3 0 RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TALK ABOUT ONE SIXTY VARIETY BLOOM OF THIS
hJPX0grNGho_4 0 A ONE FIFTY BASICALLY MEANS THAT I HAVE THE ONE INCH DIAMETER WONDERFUL INFLATED AND SIXTY INCHES LONG
hJPX0grNGho_5 0 BECAUSE OF THE SMALLER THE HAMMER YOU CAN ACTUALLY WHEN YOU TWIST THAT YOU CAN GET A LOT MORE TWIST TO HAVE TO DO THAT IS FOR THE FACT THAT QUITE AS MUCH TO IT
hJPX0grNGho_6 0 USUALLY ONE SIXTIES YOU DON'T USE FOR DESIGNS IN GENERAL LETS YOU WANT SOMETHING SMALL OR DETAIL WORK ON SOMETHING REALLY LARGE
hJPX0grNGho_7 0 FOR EXAMPLE THIS TURTLE IS NUMB JUGS REMEMBER ONE SUCCEEDS IF YOU DON'T WANT THE KNOT JUST TO BE AS LARGE AS ARMS
hJPX0grNGho_8 0 AND THEN THE OTHER THING I HAVE THE FAIRY WHICH ALSO IF YOU MAKE A SMALLER CUTER EMILY BOAT IS MOST DESIGN
hJPX0grNGho_9 0 IT'S ACTUALLY A BELT THREE IN HALF AND YOUR WALL AND THE NICE THING ABOUT ONE SIXTIES IS THAT THEY ARE CHEAPER THE TWO SIXTIES BUYING MAYBE A DOLLAR A BAG
hJPX0grNGho_10 0 BUT DUMB BELL CHEAPER IS CHEAPER
GM9nzQOBMMQ_1 0 HI THIS IS JON AND IN THIS CLIP I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THE TOOLS NEEDED TO COMPLETE OUR PROJECT
GM9nzQOBMMQ_2 0 FIRST WE'RE GOING TO NEED A PENCIL AND TAPE MEASURE TO HELP US DO ALL THE MEASURING IN MARKING IN DESIGNING A DRAWING UP OUR PROJECT
GM9nzQOBMMQ_3 0 TO CUT OUT THE ANY PIECES WE USED A RADIAL ARM SAW TO SIZE UP THE LENGTH A TABLE SAW TO CUT THE WITH AND A BAND SAW TO CUT OUR ANGLES
GM9nzQOBMMQ_4 0 FOR OUR LONG SIDES THE BOTTOM AND THE HANDLE WE USE THE RADIAL ARM SAW AGAIN TO CUT THE LENGTH AND THE TABLE SAW TO CUT THE WITH
GM9nzQOBMMQ_5 0 TO ASSEMBLE ALL OF OUR PIECES TOGETHER WE NEED A DRILL WITH A FEW DIFFERENT SIZES OF DRILL BITS THAT DEPENDING ON IF YOU WANT TO COUNTERSINK YOUR SCREWS ARE NOT
GM9nzQOBMMQ_6 0 IN ADDITION WE NEED A SCREWDRIVER BIT FOR OUR DRILL
GM9nzQOBMMQ_7 0 FOR THE HANDLE NOTCH WE USED A DRILL AND A BAND SAW TO FINISH CUTTING IT OUT
GM9nzQOBMMQ_8 0 AND FOR DIVIDERS WE USE THE SAME PROCEDURE OF USING A DRILL TO DRILL A HOLE IN A BAND SAW TO FINISH CUTTING IT OUT
GM9nzQOBMMQ_9 0 AND LASTLY WE FINISHED UP OUR PROJECT BY SAND IT WITH A FEW DIFFERENT GRITS OF SAND PAPER
gtCqNfEDSB4_1 0 HI THIS IS STEVE BAUMAN FROM SUMMER HAZE MUSIC IN MURRAY UTAH
gtCqNfEDSB4_2 0 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BASS GUITAR TODAY
gtCqNfEDSB4_3 0 AND ONE OF THE TOPICS IS HOW TO RESTRING A BASE
gtCqNfEDSB4_4 0 THE CORRECT WAY TO DO THAT
gtCqNfEDSB4_5 0 I'M GOING ON SO I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE HOW TO DO THAT
gtCqNfEDSB4_6 0 THERE'S A LOT OF THE WRONG WAY IS OUT THERE
gtCqNfEDSB4_7 0 BUT THERE IS A FEW RIGHT WAYS TO DO IT TOO
gtCqNfEDSB4_8 0 BUT I'M THE MAIN THING IS YOU DON'T WANT TO EVER DO ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO DAMAGE YOUR BASE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
gtCqNfEDSB4_9 0 IT'S USUALLY NOT A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE ALL OF THE STRINGS OFF IT WANTS
gtCqNfEDSB4_10 0 THAT CAN DO THINGS THAT CAN DAMAGE THE NECK
gtCqNfEDSB4_11 0 SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU JUST DO ONE AT A TIME
gtCqNfEDSB4_12 0 SO HERE I'VE GOT A BASE THAT HAS THE LOW E STRING TAKEN OFF
gtCqNfEDSB4_13 0 AND I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PUT IT ON
gtCqNfEDSB4_14 0 SO THE FIRST STEP IS JUST TO FEED THE STRING THROUGH DESIGNATED HOLES DOWN HERE AT THE BRIDGE
gtCqNfEDSB4_15 0 NOW SOME BASS IS HAVE THE HAVE THE HOLES IN THE BACK OF THE BASE
gtCqNfEDSB4_16 0 AND AS YOU PUT THE STRINGS TO THE BODY
gtCqNfEDSB4_17 0 BUT IF IT'S A BRIDGE LIKE THIS THERE'S JUST A HOLE RIGHT HERE FOR YOU TO FEED THE STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_18 0 AND THEN ONCE YOU DO THAT
gtCqNfEDSB4_19 0 JUST PULL THE STRING ALL THE WAY THROUGH
gtCqNfEDSB4_20 0 AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS IN THE RIGHT SPOT
gtCqNfEDSB4_21 0 AND THAT THIS IS GOING OVER WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO COME OVER THE SADDLE
gtCqNfEDSB4_22 0 NOW THIS IS CALLED THE SADDLE RIGHT IN HERE
gtCqNfEDSB4_23 0 SO ONCE YOU DO THAT THEN WE MOVE UP TO THE OTHER END OF THE BASE
gtCqNfEDSB4_24 0 ONCE WE'RE HERE WE WANT TO HAVE THE RIGHT LENGTH OF STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_25 0 BECAUSE IF NOT YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH A TON OF WRAPPING
gtCqNfEDSB4_26 0 WHICH CAN BE KEY WHICH CAN AFFECT THE INTONATION THE FACE
gtCqNfEDSB4_27 0 AND THEY CAN ALSO MAKES THIS STRING POP OFF OF THE TUNER
gtCqNfEDSB4_28 0 SO A GOOD RULE OF THUMB IS TO THE EXTENT PULL THE STRING ALL THE WAY TIGHT
gtCqNfEDSB4_29 0 AND JUST EXTEND IT ALL THE WAY
gtCqNfEDSB4_30 0 AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE A GOOD A FOUR FIVE INCHES BEYOND THE TUNING PEG
gtCqNfEDSB4_31 0 THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE WRAPPING IT IN
gtCqNfEDSB4_32 0 SO JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO WRAP IT AT LEAST A COUPLE TIMES
gtCqNfEDSB4_33 0 YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE TOO LONG
gtCqNfEDSB4_34 0 BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE TOO SHORT
gtCqNfEDSB4_35 0 SO THE FIRST STEP IS JUST TO HIS TO STICK THE END OF THE STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_36 0 WELL THE FIRST OF ALL YOU WANT TO CUT THE STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_37 0 IT JUST SOME GOOD WIRE CUTTERS TO THE RIGHT LENGTH THAT YOU WANT IT
gtCqNfEDSB4_38 0 SO YOU WANT TO TAKE THE END OF THE STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_39 0 AND BE CAREFUL BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY SHARP ON THE END
gtCqNfEDSB4_40 0 AND JUST STICK IT DOWN INTO THE HOLE THAT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS TUNING MACHINES
gtCqNfEDSB4_41 0 THERE'S A WHOLE THE GO STRAIGHT DOWN
gtCqNfEDSB4_42 0 SO STICK IT DOWN THERE FIRST
gtCqNfEDSB4_43 0 DON'T WRAP IT FIRST
gtCqNfEDSB4_44 0 STICK IT DOWN THERE FIRST
gtCqNfEDSB4_45 0 AND THEN ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS YOU BRING IT OFF
gtCqNfEDSB4_46 0 AND PUT SOME CREASES IN THE STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_47 0 AND JUST WRAP IT ONCE OR TWICE
gtCqNfEDSB4_48 0 AND YOU WANT IT TO COME OFF ON THE INSIDE OF THE BASE
gtCqNfEDSB4_49 0 NOT COME UP ON THE OUTSIDE
gtCqNfEDSB4_50 0 BECAUSE THAT WAY YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO TURN THE RIGHT WAY
gtCqNfEDSB4_51 0 SO GRAB THE STRING ONCE OR TWICE KICK CLOCKWISE
gtCqNfEDSB4_52 0 AND THEN PUSH THE STRING DOWN
gtCqNfEDSB4_53 0 SO THAT YOU'RE PRESSING IT AGAINST THE HEADSTOCK HERE
gtCqNfEDSB4_54 0 AND FEED IT THROUGH WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO
gtCqNfEDSB4_55 0 AND THEN JUST START WINDING
gtCqNfEDSB4_56 0 YOU'LL WANT TO KEEP SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_57 0 AND PUSH IT DOWN
gtCqNfEDSB4_58 0 SO THAT IT DOESN'T COME OUT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
gtCqNfEDSB4_59 0 AND ALSO YOU WANT IT
gtCqNfEDSB4_60 0 SO THAT IT'S REAL IT'S WINDING DOWN TOWARDS THE BASE
gtCqNfEDSB4_61 0 I'M NOT WINDING FROM THE BOTTOM UP
gtCqNfEDSB4_62 0 SO JUST WIND IT UP
gtCqNfEDSB4_63 0 KIND OF MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE STAYING IN RIGHT POSITION
gtCqNfEDSB4_64 0 MAKING SURE THAT DOWN AT THE SADDLE THAT'S STAYING WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE
gtCqNfEDSB4_65 0 AND THAT ONCE YOU GET IT TIGHT ENOUGH
gtCqNfEDSB4_66 0 AND BRING THE BRING THE STRING UP TO PITCH
gtCqNfEDSB4_67 0 AND YOU WANT TO PUT SOME TENSION ON IT
gtCqNfEDSB4_68 0 THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE ALL THE WAY TIE ALL THE WAY TO PITCH
gtCqNfEDSB4_69 0 BUT YOU JUST PUT IT PUT SOME TENSION ON IT BEFORE YOU START ON THE NEXT STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_70 0 HIS THAT'S THE SUMMER HAZE MUSIC DOT COM FOR INFORMATION ABOUT MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS

HEdDKhVJOYw_13 0 AGAIN SET IN THERE
HEdDKhVJOYw_14 0 IT'S ALREADY CDR IT'S ALREADY SUCKING UP A LOT OF WATER
HEdDKhVJOYw_15 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THE ENTIRE BRICK TURNS IT VERY DARK GREEN

HEdDKhVJOYw_24 0 OUR NEXT STEP WILL BE WIRING RC MEDIUMS ON OUR WIRE
GcI-VbklEus_1 0 MOST LOGICAL PLACE TO ME TO KEEP YOUR DISH TOWELS AND AND IT CAN TOWELS ARE OVER NEAR THE SINK BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE USUALLY GOING TO BE USING ON THE MOST
GcI-VbklEus_2 0 I DON'T HAVE ANY STORAGE SPACE LEFT OVER BY MY SINK SO SO I KEEP MINE OVER HERE A BY THE OVEN WHICH I DON'T HAVE THE BIG OF A KITCHEN SO THE MAKE THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE
GcI-VbklEus_3 0 BUT I JUST HAVE ALL MY DOES TOWELS FOLD IT IN HERE AND AND AND JUST KEPT IN THE STORE AND THEN ANOTHER DRAWER I HAVE MY NAPKINS AND MY DISH TOWELS AND AND AND MY AT TABLE CLAWS ALL ALL IN THE STORE
GcI-VbklEus_4 0 AND I DON'T HAVE PAPER NAPKINS OR PAPER TOWELS BUT THERE'S SEVERAL OPTIONS FOR FOR PLACES TO STORE THOSE TWO
GcI-VbklEus_5 0 AGAIN I THINK THE MOST LOGICAL PLACE TO KEEP THEM IS OVER BY THE SINK
GcI-VbklEus_6 0 THERE ARE YOU CAN FIND THINGS WHERE YOU CAN STAND THAT PAPER TOWELS
GcI-VbklEus_7 0 THERE'S LOTS OF CONTAINERS THAT YOU CAN KEEP NAPKINS IN

GvNqJ8T_btw_3 0 SO THIS IS GOING TO BE OUR OFFENSIVE LINEMEN GO AHEAD DOWN YOUR THREE POINT STANCE IS OUR DEFENSIVE ALIGNMENT AND HIS THREE POINT STANCE
GvNqJ8T_btw_4 0 ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT HE'S GOT TO DO AS A DEFENDER IF HE'S NOT GOING TO USE A SPECIAL MOVE TO GET AROUND THIS GUY IS HE'S GOT TO KEEP HIM WITH HIS LITTLE ARMS LOCKED OUT AND HE'S GOT TO KEEP THIS GUY OFF OF HIM
GvNqJ8T_btw_5 0 WE NEVER WANT THE OFFENSIVE GUIDE TO BE ABLE TO GET INSIDE OF OUR DEFENDER AND STAND HIM UP AND CONTROL WHAT'S HAPPENING
GvNqJ8T_btw_6 0 WE WANT THIS GUY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE HIS HANDS LOCKED OUT SO HE CAN CONTROL OR THIS GUY'S GOING
GvNqJ8T_btw_7 0 SO JUST WALK THROUGH JUST COME UP AND SHOWING ONE
GvNqJ8T_btw_8 0 I MEAN BY FIRE TO GO AHEAD SET HOT FIRE UP OKAY HE'S KEEPING THIS GUY OUT SO THIS GUY CAN'T GET UNDERNEATH POSITION AND LOCK HIM OUT
GvNqJ8T_btw_9 0 NOW THE NEXT THING HE WANTS TO DO IS HE'S GOING TO TRY TO TELL THIS GUY WHERE IS GOING
GvNqJ8T_btw_10 0 EITHER SHEDDING TO THIS WAY OR SETTING TO THAT WAY
GvNqJ8T_btw_11 0 HE CAN'T DO THAT EFFECTIVELY IF HE HAS GOT THOSE ARMS LOCKED OUT AND HE DIDN'T FIRE UP QUICKLY AND KEEP HIM HELD OUT
gFe8e_OTItc_1 0 OKAY SO I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT SOME MATERIALS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE ON THE OIL FILTER SOME THINGS THAT WILL HELP YOU
gFe8e_OTItc_2 0 JUST MAKE GOOD JOB OF CHANGING YOUR OIL A LOT EASIER
gFe8e_OTItc_3 0 NUMBER ONE IS GOING TO BE SOME KIND OF DRAIN PANS
gFe8e_OTItc_4 0 THESE ARE GOING TO CATCH THE OIL AS YOU'RE TRAINING THE OLD OIL OUT OF YOUR OUT OF YOUR VEHICLE
gFe8e_OTItc_5 0 OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST TRIM THE OIL OVER THE A YOUR DRIVEWAY OR JUST THE STREET OR WHATEVER
gFe8e_OTItc_6 0 SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU MAKE SURE YOU GET THESE OIL PANS OR SOME VERSION OF THE OIL PANS
gFe8e_OTItc_7 0 SOME ARE ARE A LITTLE MORE SELF-CONTAINED THE LIKE YOU KNOW CLOSE OVER THE OIL
gFe8e_OTItc_8 0 AND YOU HAVE A NICE WILL SPOUT YOU CAN JUST POUR THE OLD OIL INTO AN OLD CONTAINER AND YOUR RECYCLE IT
gFe8e_OTItc_9 0 AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECYCLE YOUR OIL I SAY A METAL PARTS ARE ABOUT YOUR WELL

GcLxTqAwEmc_2 0 WE COULD HAVE IT COME RIGHT UP THE BACK BUT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE MORE DRAMATIC IF WE COME HAT HAVE IT COME RIGHT OFF THE TOP
GcLxTqAwEmc_3 0 SO FIRST THING WE WANT TO DO IS SHAPE OUR TAIL AND THINKING THAT WILL GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT OF A TWIST
GcLxTqAwEmc_4 0 YOU CAN DO THAT BY WRAPPING IT AROUND YOUR FINGER AND WE CAN STRAIGHTEN IT OUT ONCE WE'RE DONE
GcLxTqAwEmc_5 0 IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS YOU WANT TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THIS AND THE PART THAT'S GOING TO BE INSERTED
GcLxTqAwEmc_6 0 AND YOU'VE GOT TO FIND THE RIGHT PLACE TO STICK IT IN
GcLxTqAwEmc_7 0 IF WE WANT TO CHANGE YOUR MIND AND WE PULL IT BACK OUT AGAIN THAT'S OKAY BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SMOOTH OVER THAT SPOT FIX IT AND CHOOSE ANOTHER SPOT
GcLxTqAwEmc_8 0 WHEN WE PUT IT IN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT GOES IN FAR ENOUGH THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO FALL OUT BECAUSE ONCE THIS RAT IS DRY YOU DON'T HAVE THE OPTION OF PUTTING IT IN AGAIN
GcLxTqAwEmc_9 0 YOU CAN ALSO BEND IT AROUND YOU CAN MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A PLAYFUL WRAPPED BRING OUT THIS WAY
GcLxTqAwEmc_10 0 THERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS WE CAN DO YOU CAN ALSO KEEP IT STRAIGHT IF YOU WANTED TO I LIKE THE CURVE AND PUT IT RIGHT OVER THE TOP

gd1NCFaCODg_1 0 DUSTING BIG SCREEN TV IS IS IT EASY JOB
gd1NCFaCODg_2 0 HOWEVER IF YOU DUST IT AND IT HAS DIRT ACCUMULATED ON IT
gd1NCFaCODg_3 0 WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS IT WILL SCRATCH YOUR SCREEN
gd1NCFaCODg_4 0 SO MAKE SURE THAT THE SCREEN IS CLEAN
gd1NCFaCODg_5 0 AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO GET VERY SOFT CLOTH WITH VINEGAR AND WATER
gd1NCFaCODg_6 0 MAKE SURE YOU SPRAY THE MIXTURE DIRECTLY ON THE CLOTH OR NOT ON THE SCREEN
gd1NCFaCODg_7 0 WIPE IT CLEAN
gd1NCFaCODg_8 0 ESPECIALLY IN THE CORNERS TOP IN BACK WERE THE DUST ACCUMULATES
gd1NCFaCODg_9 0 THEN TO KEEP THE DUST FROM GOING ONTO THE SPRING YOU'RE GOING TO GET A DRIER SHEET IF IT'S FRAGRANCE THAT'S EVEN BETTER
gd1NCFaCODg_10 0 WIPE IT ON THE SPRING
gd1NCFaCODg_11 0 THEN BUFF THE SCREEN AND IT WILL KEEP DUST FROM ACCUMULATING ON THE SCREEN FOR A WHILE

g9wzKPxdcLQ_1 0 I'M JASON SHOEMAKER AT SLUGFEST PRINTMAKING WORKSHOP AND I'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PAPER PREPARATION FOR INTAGLIO PRINT MAKING
g9wzKPxdcLQ_2 0 AND IT'S TELLING FOR MAKING YOUR ACTUALLY PUSHING PAPER DOWN INTO THE CREVICES AND THE PRINTING MATRIX AND PULLING THE INK OUT OF THERE
g9wzKPxdcLQ_3 0 SO IT'S NECESSARY TO HAVE THE PAPER LITTLE MORE MALLEABLE THAN IT IS WHEN IT'S DRY
g9wzKPxdcLQ_4 0 SOAKING IN WATER HELPS THAT
g9wzKPxdcLQ_5 0 IT ALSO HELPS TO TAKE SOME EXTRA STARCH AND A BINDING AGENTS ARE PUTTING THE PAPER WHEN IT WAS MADE
g9wzKPxdcLQ_6 0 SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO PRIOR TO PRINTING IS HAVE A WATER BATH
g9wzKPxdcLQ_7 0 BUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED FOR HOWEVER MUCH YOU ARE GOING TO PRINT SET IN WATER AND LET IT SOAK
g9wzKPxdcLQ_8 0 USUALLY JUST A COUPLE MINUTES IS FINE
g9wzKPxdcLQ_9 0 I USUALLY SET IT UP AND THEN GO SET UP THE PRESS AND YOU KNOW START INKING UP THE PLATES AND THEN BY THAT TIME IT'S USUALLY GOOD
g9wzKPxdcLQ_10 0 WHEN YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY GET THE PAPER OUT YOUR HANDS DIRTY FOR MAKING UM TONGS ARE VERY HANDY
g9wzKPxdcLQ_11 0 AND YOU CAN ALSO JUST REACH IN HERE AND GRAB IT
g9wzKPxdcLQ_12 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS PULL IT LET THE EXTRA WATER DRAIN OFF
g9wzKPxdcLQ_13 0 ONCE THAT'S DONE WE HAVE A TOWEL HERE WHICH IS GOING TO GET MORE THE EXCESS SURFACE WATER OUT
g9wzKPxdcLQ_14 0 YOU JUST WANT THE WATER DOWN INTO THE PAPER IN THERE ISN'T MUCH THERE TO START WITH
g9wzKPxdcLQ_15 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE ON BLOTTER PAPER WHICH IS JUST A REALLY THICK ABSORBENT PAPER
g9wzKPxdcLQ_16 0 TILES WE'RE GOOD IF IT'S JUST A SMALL SHOP
g9wzKPxdcLQ_17 0 A ROLLING PINS WORK TO ACTUALLY OFF OF THE PAPER OR I CAN DO IS CREATE CREASES IN THE PAPER
g9wzKPxdcLQ_18 0 WHEN I'M USUALLY IN TOO MUCH OF A HURRY SELL THIS USE MY FOREARM AND JUST GO ACROSS LIKE THAT
g9wzKPxdcLQ_19 0 AND THAT IS PLENTY
g9wzKPxdcLQ_20 0 ONCE THAT'S DONE AND PULL THE PAPER OFF AND IF YOU SEE ANY WATER PULLING UP IN THE SURFACE IS GO AHEAD AND DO THAT PROCESS OVER AGAIN BUT IF IT LOOKS GOOD NICE AND EVEN THERE'S LITTLE MOISTURE YOU'RE READY TO GO

GL1aNimfMxs_4 0 NOW THAT'S A LOT OF THE MOTIONS RUNNING THROUGH MOST OF US ON A DAILY BASIS AND THOSE EMOTIONS HAPPEN WHEN SOMETHING CONNECTS WITH OUR ENERGY AND CAUSES THAT CHEMICAL RESPONSE
GL1aNimfMxs_5 0 THIS LITTLE ENERGY BALL IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT
GL1aNimfMxs_6 0 IT'S GOT TO TERMINALS ON IT AND IF I ONLY TOUCH ONE NOTHING HAPPENS
GL1aNimfMxs_7 0 WITH THE MOMENT TO TOUCH THE OTHER TERMINAL WE NOW HAVE LIGHT AND SOUND

GL1aNimfMxs_16 0 AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW THERE'S NO ROOM FOR THE ENERGY IN MOTION TO FLOW THROUGH THE PIPE
GL1aNimfMxs_17 0 THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TO US
GL1aNimfMxs_18 0 WHEN THAT HAPPENS EVENTUALLY SIMPLY WILL CAUSE THOSE TWO MOTIONS TO EXPLODE

GFfMVNhUO3E_10 0 THERE'S JUST A FEW THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO SERVE
GFfMVNhUO3E_11 0 DRY YOU GOT TO REMEMBER IN NATURE OUT IN THE WILD
GFfMVNhUO3E_12 0 USUALLY FIND BLUEBIRDS IN WIDE OPEN FIELDS WITH JUST A FEW TREES
GFfMVNhUO3E_13 0 AND THERE'S LOTS OF FRUITS BERRIES
GFfMVNhUO3E_14 0 A LOT OF CHERRIES AND THOSE ARE THE APPLES ALL KINDS OF TREES AND SHRUBS THAT THEY CAN LIVE IN
GFfMVNhUO3E_15 0 WE ALSO NEED A LOT OF PLACES TO RAZOR YOUNG
GFfMVNhUO3E_16 0 SO IN THE WILD THEY HAVE OLD TREES
GFfMVNhUO3E_17 0 WHEN TREES TO EITHER HOLLOW
GFfMVNhUO3E_18 0 SO THEY MAKE THEIR HOMES INSIDE THE HOLLOW TREATS
GFfMVNhUO3E_19 0 WELL IN OUR GARDENS WHICH WE DON'T USUALLY HAVE A LOT A HOLLOW TREES
GFfMVNhUO3E_20 0 SO WE CAN ADD LIVE A LITTLE BIT AND ENJOY THE BLUEBIRDS IN OUR GARDEN AS WELL
GFfMVNhUO3E_21 0 SO I MIGHT NOT HAVE A LOT OF DEAD LOGS ON MY PROPERTY
GFfMVNhUO3E_22 0 BUT I DO HAVE A LOT OF BIRD HOUSES
GFfMVNhUO3E_23 0 AND THE KEY WITH THE BLUEBIRDS AS YOU DON'T WANT THE WHOLE TO THE ENTRANCE TO THE HOME
GFfMVNhUO3E_24 0 TO BE ANY LARGER THAN TWO INCHES
GFfMVNhUO3E_25 0 BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT LARGER BIRDS ARE CROW'S TO GET IN THERE AND ATTACK THE BABIES
GFfMVNhUO3E_26 0 OR GET THE EGGS OUT
GFfMVNhUO3E_27 0 AND SO JUST ABOUT TWO INCHES SEEMS TO BE THE KEY
GFfMVNhUO3E_28 0 I'M BLUEBIRDS IN SPARROWS ALL LOVE BIRD HOUSES
GFfMVNhUO3E_29 0 AND SO I'VE GOT THEM ALL OVER MY PROPERTY
GFfMVNhUO3E_30 0 AND IT GIVES THEM A PLACE TO LIVE

GFfMVNhUO3E_32 0 THAT THEY CAN LIVE AS WELL
GFfMVNhUO3E_33 0 SO THE SCENE PRETTY HAPPY IN MY GARDEN
GFfMVNhUO3E_34 0 THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE OF YOUR GARDEN TO ATTRACT BIRDS
GFfMVNhUO3E_35 0 ANY TYPE OF BIRDS ESPECIALLY BLUEBIRDS IS WATER
GFfMVNhUO3E_36 0 YOU CANNOT HAVE BIRDS ON YOUR PROPERTY WITHOUT WATER
GFfMVNhUO3E_37 0 AND THE SPARROWS IN THE BLUEBIRDS AND THE BLUE DAZE JUST LOVE MY LITTLE ROCK WATER FOUNTAIN
GFfMVNhUO3E_38 0 AND EVEN THIS MORNING I SELL A LOT OF THEM PLAIN IN THERE

GFfMVNhUO3E_43 0 NO BLEACH KNOW I'LL JUST ALL IS YOU REDUCE IRS
GFfMVNhUO3E_44 0 PRETTY MUCH NOTHING
GFfMVNhUO3E_45 0 MY KEY IS TO MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT PUT THEM IN FULL HOT SUN
GFfMVNhUO3E_46 0 SO THEY DON'T GET AS MUCH ALGAE
GFfMVNhUO3E_47 0 AND ALSO I JUST DRAIN ALL THE WATER OUT PUT FRESH THE WATER IN IT
GFfMVNhUO3E_48 0 JUST BY ADDING THE HOSE TO IT FOR ABOUT AN HOUR ONCE A WEEK
GFfMVNhUO3E_49 0 AND THAT'S ABOUT ENOUGH TO KEEP THE WATER FRESH FOR THE BIRDS
GFfMVNhUO3E_50 0 BLUEBIRDS ALSO NEED SOME KIND OF A FOOD SOURCE
GFfMVNhUO3E_51 0 AND THEY LOVE SUNFLOWERS AND THEY LOVE TO ALL TYPES OF BERRIES
GFfMVNhUO3E_52 0 BLUEBERRIES AND BLACKBERRIES IN RASPBERRIES AND SHERRY'S

H1EjVAs2GlM_4 0 YOU GET YOURSELF SET UP FIRST INTO A LUNGE POSITION
H1EjVAs2GlM_5 0 FROM YOUR ANKLE TO YOUR NEED YOUR HIP AS A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE
H1EjVAs2GlM_6 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOUR BACK HIP IS TUCKED UNDER GOING STRAIGHT DOWN TOWARDS THE FLOOR
H1EjVAs2GlM_7 0 WE WANT TO REMAIN ON THE BALL THE FOOT AND NOT FLAT HEEL
H1EjVAs2GlM_8 0 SO MAKE SURE THAT HIP IS TUCKED UNDER

H1EjVAs2GlM_13 0 I'M GOING TO ENGAGE THE SIDE OF MY OBLIQUE YOU'RE ALWAYS TWISTING INTO THE NEED THAT IS IN FRONT
H1EjVAs2GlM_14 0 AS YOU COME UP YOU'RE GOING TO TWIST AND COME BACK DOWN
H1EjVAs2GlM_15 0 SO THINK ABOUT CROSSING OVER THE BODY AND DROPPING BACK DOWN KEEP THE ELBOWS REALLY TIGHT AND STABLE
H1EjVAs2GlM_16 0 NICE STRONG MOTION ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE BODY
H1EjVAs2GlM_17 0 SO THINK ABOUT SOME THINGS TO THINK ABOUT

gtEi2g0g5ws_3 0 AND AGAIN AS I'VE SAID THAN THE ONLY REAL SAFETY CONCERNED WITH CHANGING GUITAR STRINGS IS THE SHARP IN SO THAT THE THAT STRINGS CAN HAVE ON THEM AND YOU DON'T WANT THESE IN A PLASTIC TRASH BAG LOSE WHERE THEY CAN POKE THROUGH AND SCRATCH SOMEBODY OR EVEN A IMPALE SOMEBODY
gtEi2g0g5ws_4 0 SO YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND WRAP THEM CAREFULLY IN A IN A LOOSE COIL LIKE THIS AND YOUR GOAL IS TO KIND OF TUT ALL OF SHARP ENDS UNIT TOWARDS THE INSIDE
gtEi2g0g5ws_5 0 AND THEN YOU CAN GET A ONE OF THESE A PAPER BAG TO PACKED IN AND AND EVEN IF YOU WANT TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL HACK IT BACK INSIDE THE VINYL OR CARDBOARD PACKAGING PAIN
gtEi2g0g5ws_6 0 THAT WAY YOU CAN THROW IT AWAY WITH THE CLEAN CONSCIENCE THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE SOMEBODY TETANUS WITH YOUR NEW CHANGE GUITARS STRING
GDp_ahHKbns_1 0 WHEN YOU'RE CHANGING YOUR BRAKE FLUID FIRST THING YOU DO IS YOU POP THE CAP OFF YOUR MASTER CYLINDER
GDp_ahHKbns_2 0 THEN YOU TAKE A TURKEY BASTER EVEN SUCK ALL THOSE OUT PUT NEW FLUID IN AND YOU GO UNDERNEATH THE CAR
GDp_ahHKbns_3 0 SO YOU HAVE SOME INSIDE THE CAR PUSHING DOWN THE BRAKE PEDAL AND WANTS TO HAVE THE BRAKE PEDAL DOWN ALL THE WAY THEY'LL SAY DOWN AND YOU WILL LOOSEN THIS LEADERS OFF RIGHT HERE IN THIS DIRECTION AND LIQUID WILL COME OUT THAT IS GOING TO CATCH CAN FOR THAT TO BECAUSE IT IS IN LINE IS PAINT REALLY THAT OR WHEN YOU'RE DONE JUST WIPE IT ALL OFF AND ONCE YOU'VE HAD IT SO THAT NO MORE LOOK IS COMING OUT YOU TIGHTEN IT BACK UP AND YOU TELL THEM THAT BACK UP AND THEY PUSH IT DOWN AGAIN AND YOU REPEAT THAT WHEN YOU OPEN THIS AGAIN AND LEAVE IT OUT IN PERIODICALLY MAKE SURE YOU'RE CHECKING THE MASTER CYLINDER WHICH IS WILLIE AND OPEN IT FIRST AND WE USE A TURKEY BASTER FOR FOR TAKING OUT THE FLUID AND YOU KEEP DOING THIS STEP OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON THIS PARTICULAR WE'LL UNTIL YOU GET A NEW CLEAR FLUID COMING OUT AND THIS ONE IS DONE AND YOU WOULD MOVE THE NEXT ONE IN THE BACK AND THEN USE A FROM ONES
GDp_ahHKbns_4 0 IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT ORDER

GDp_ahHKbns_6 0 I ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
GDp_ahHKbns_7 0 ALMOST ALL THE BLEEDER VALVES OR ON THE TOP OF THE WHEEL AND GO BACK AND BACKING PLAY ON THE WHEEL AND THEY ALL LOOK ABOUT THE SAME AND LIKE WILL HACKS LITTLE SMALL SPOT IN THE HOLE RIGHT THERE SO YOU LOOSEN IT IS A WRENCH THEY CAN SEE THIS LID COMING OUT THAT WAY THEY TELL WHEN THE NEW FLUID IS COMING OUT IN ALL THE CLEAR THE NEW FLUID YOU CAN SEE WHEN THE OLD OLD STUFFS ALL FLESH OUT THE SYSTEM CLEANLY
GDp_ahHKbns_8 0 MOST CARS EASE THE OTHER TEETH OR BRAKE FLUID SOME CARS THESE DEAL TEA FOR AND FOR THAT AGAIN YOU LISTEN TO LOOK AT THE OWNER'S MANUAL AND SEE WITH A RECOMMEND

gjgIM_u-bJU_1 0 THE BASIC CHAIN WOULD REFER TO THE ORDER IN WHICH THE PEDALS ARE PLACED ON THE BOARD
gjgIM_u-bJU_2 0 BECAUSE AS YOU GO ALONG YOU'RE GOING TO GO OUT OF YOUR GUITAR INTO THE FIRST PEDAL
gjgIM_u-bJU_3 0 WHEN WE GET TO THE SECOND PEDAL THE SECOND PEDAL IS GOING TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON EVERYTHING THAT CAME BEFORE IT
gjgIM_u-bJU_4 0 SO WHEN I HIT THIS DISTORTION PEDAL THIS IS JUST A TUNER IT'S JUST BY PASS TO THIS ISN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING
gjgIM_u-bJU_5 0 IT'S JUST FOR TUNING BUT THE GUITAR COMES BEFORE IT
gjgIM_u-bJU_6 0 SO WHEN I PUT THIS DISTORTION ON IT AFFECTS THE GUITAR
gjgIM_u-bJU_7 0 NOW IF WE GO FURTHER DOWN THE LINE TO THIS TREMELO PEDAL
gjgIM_u-bJU_8 0 THIS GENERAL A PEDAL IS AFFECTING THIS DISTORTION THIS DISTORTION AND THE GUITAR
gjgIM_u-bJU_9 0 SO THE ORDER IN WHICH YOU HAVE THE PEDALS INFLUENCES THE SOUND THAT YOU GET BY THE TIME IT GETS THAT TO THE END
gjgIM_u-bJU_10 0 SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I TOOK THIS DELAY PEDAL AND PUT IT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAIN I WOULD BE DISTORTING THE SOUND OF THE DELAY RATHER THAN IF I PUT IT AT THE END
gjgIM_u-bJU_11 0 THE DELAY WOULD BE DELAYING THE SOUND OF EVERYTHING THAT CAME BEFORE

HCEhbsQ8cDY_1 0 SO WE TALKED ABOUT HOW IN THIS GAME IS ONE TURN OR ONE VOYAGE SHIP CAPPING CREW WHICH IS THREE ROLLS
HCEhbsQ8cDY_2 0 SO IN THOSE THREE ROLLS THE VERY FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO HAVE IS A SIX
HCEhbsQ8cDY_3 0 IF YOU ROLL AND SAY IT COMES UP LIKE THAT WITH NO SIXES THEN YOU CAN'T USE ANYTHING ELSE IN THE ROLL
HCEhbsQ8cDY_4 0 YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SIX FIRST
HCEhbsQ8cDY_5 0 SO A SHIP A SIX COMES FIRST
HCEhbsQ8cDY_6 0 SO I HAVE TO ROLL AND GET A SIX BEFORE CAN USE ANYTHING ELSE
HCEhbsQ8cDY_7 0 THERE'S A SIX AND THEN JUST A FIVE COMES NEXT WHICH IS THE CAPTAIN
HCEhbsQ8cDY_8 0 THERE'S THE CAPTAIN THEN I CAN'T USE THE CARGO UNLESS I HAVE A FOUR WHICH IS THE CREW
HCEhbsQ8cDY_9 0 BUT REMEMBER IF I SAID IF I SAY ROLLED THAT I CAN GO OH THERE'S THERE'S THE KEPT IN THERE IS A CREW
HCEhbsQ8cDY_10 0 I'M GOING TO SHIP ON THE NEXT ROLL DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT
HCEhbsQ8cDY_11 0 SHIP NUMBER SIX COMES FIRST
GIVRVRNHFkA_1 0 HERE WE'LL TALK ABOUT A SUSPENDED TWO
GIVRVRNHFkA_2 0 NOW LET'S START WITH A D CHORD AGAIN
GIVRVRNHFkA_3 0 HERE'S OUR D MAJOR CHORD
GIVRVRNHFkA_4 0 NOW WE SET THAT WE HAD IT OPEN D STRING IS THE ROOT

GIVRVRNHFkA_10 0 SO WE'RE IN D HERE
GIVRVRNHFkA_11 0 A D MAJOR SCALE THE SECOND NOTE OF A MAJOR SCALE IS GOING TO BE E SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS TAKE ALL OF THE THIRDS
GIVRVRNHFkA_12 0 I THIRDS OR F SHARPS

GIVRVRNHFkA_14 0 IN THIS CASE WE'RE GOING TO LIFT UP THE MIDDLE FINGER HERE AND TURN THIS F SHARP AND DO AN OPEN E STRING
GIVRVRNHFkA_15 0 AND NOW YOU HAVE THE D SUSPENDED TWO
g8SjkolnHfY_1 0 SO AFTER I AS I'M ESTABLISH THE BORDER WITH MY PAINTERS TAPE AROUND THE AREA AND TO COLLAGE
g8SjkolnHfY_2 0 AGAIN MAKING SURE THAT ALL THE EDGES ARE ACTUALLY FACING THE INSIDE OF COLLAGE ARE MOST IMPORTANTLY IT HERE DOWN VERY WELL ON BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT ANY ADHESIVE OR GLUE OR ANYTHING GETTING AN SEEPING UNDERNEATH THE EDGES
g8SjkolnHfY_3 0 THE NEXT STEP YOU WANT TO DO IS EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE DRAWN YOUR IMAGE INSIDE TO THE LIKENESS OF THAT YOU WANT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GO OVER IT WITH YOUR GRAPHITE PENCIL AND YOU JUST MAKE SURE YOU'RE ADDING ALL THE DETAIL ELEMENTS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE AS YOU'RE WORKING A LONG BEFORE YOU SPRAY YOUR FIXATIVE SPRAY
g8SjkolnHfY_4 0 AGAIN THE REASON FOR THIS IS SO THAT YOU KEEP ALL YOUR DETAIL SO THAT WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY WORKING WITH YOUR COLLAGES ISN'T SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO CONTINUALLY BE PAYING ATTENTION TO AND REESTABLISHING IN REDRAWING ALL OF YOUR LINE WORK
g8SjkolnHfY_5 0 SO I TEND TO GO OVER IT AND OVER IT UNTIL I FEEL THAT THE LINES ARE SUFFICIENTLY DARK ENOUGH AND ONCE I'VE GOTTEN TO THAT POINT AND I TAKE MY WORKABLE FIXATIVE SPRAY ON MY SPRAYED INSIDE OF THE AREA IN ORDER TO JUST KEEP THE GRAPHITE DOWN TO START MY COLLAGE

GItM5QLjQ54_1 0 WHEN YOU'RE CREEKING IN ONE HIGH CLASS CREEKS THE CLASS FOR CLASSIFIED CREATES THE WATER TENS MOVE PRETTY QUICKLY SO IF YOU SWIM OUT OF YOUR BOAT YOU CAN HAVE THE UNFORTUNATE SITUATION OF HAVING TO CHASE AFTER THAT
GItM5QLjQ54_2 0 AND GETTING OUT OF THE WATER CAN BE PROBLEMATIC IF THERE'S A LOT OF WATER IN IT SO THIS IS WHY WE USE FLOTATION BAGS
GItM5QLjQ54_3 0 FLOTATION BAGS WHEN THEY'RE FILLED UP COMPLETELY AND THEY'RE INSIDE THE BOAT DISPLAYS WATER FROM THE BOAT SO THEY ALWAYS HAVE SOME SORT OF THE BOAT OR SOME PART OF THE BOAT LIFTING UP TOWARDS THE SURFACE SO YOU CAN PULL ON IT TOWARDS YOUR
GItM5QLjQ54_4 0 THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE FLOTATION BAGS IF YOU'RE ON A MULTI DAY TRIP AND IF YOU ARE OUT IN THE BACK COUNTRY FOR A COUPLE DAYS AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF HERE THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE WITH YOU YOU CAN ALSO USE DRY BAGS FILLED WITH HERE AS LONG AS A WATERPROOF DISPLAYS THAT WATER
GItM5QLjQ54_5 0 IT MAY NOT FLOAT AS HIGH AS A FLOW BAG BUT IT WON'T SINK AS LOW AS YOU YOUR BOAT FILL OF WATER SO THE FLIP BAGS ARE PRETTY SELF EXPLANATORY WHEN YOU PUT THEM IN THE BOAT YOU WANT THEM WITH THOSE LITTLE AIR AS MUCH AS YOU CAN IN THE FLOW BAGS
GItM5QLjQ54_6 0 GENERALLY THEY GO BEHIND THE SEAT SLIDE IN BEHIND THE BACK BEND IT AND THEN BLOW UP THROUGH THE AIR TO RIGHT HERE IS TO THEN STUFF HERE TO BACK IN THE NUTS IN THE GRAB ONTO

Hiksl7JI3mw_1 0 THE RIGHT HAMSTRING A STRAP A SCRAP CAN BE USED BY JUST LAY RIGHT DOWN THE SAUCE SURFACE ON YOUR BACK AND BY DOING THIS TIP YOUR PELVIS FORWARD
Hiksl7JI3mw_2 0 NOT TIGHT HAMSTRINGS CREATE DISCOMFORT YOUR LOWER BACK THAT'S WHY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO USE SOMETHING LIKE A STRAP NOT JUST USE YOUR HANDS YOU GO THE DEEPER
Hiksl7JI3mw_3 0 TAKE OUR RIGHT FOOT UP AND TAKE THAT STRAP AROUND THE BALL THE FOOT AND THEN EQUALIZE THE LENGTH OF THE STRUT AND AS YOU EQUALIZE LIKE THE STRAP SECURE AROUND YOUR RIGHT HAND SO YOU HAVE A GOOD FIRM GRIP

g7nmnwADi_E_3 0 SOMETIMES SHORT DIE NO JUST FLYING THROUGH THE AIR
g7nmnwADi_E_4 0 SO IN ORDER TO DO THAT WELL IN CONTROL YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT STILL SOME BASIC THINGS IN REALLY EXTENDING THEM TO THE LIMITS
g7nmnwADi_E_5 0 BY USING THE OVERHANGING TECHNIQUE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WITH YOUR ARMS STRAIGHT KEEPING YOUR HIPS CLOSE TO THE WALL
g7nmnwADi_E_6 0 YOU'RE GETTING STARTED WITH YOUR WEIGHT MOSTLY ON YOUR FEET
g7nmnwADi_E_7 0 SO FROM HERE TO GET WAY OF THEIR I WANT TO USE MY LEGS FOR POWER AND MY ARMS TO DIRECT WHERE I'M GOING AND SOME POWER
g7nmnwADi_E_8 0 SO I'M WOUND UP TO GO HERE AND I WANT TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME PUMPING MY ARMS YOU SEE PEOPLE DO THAT AVOID THAT I WANT TO THINK ABOUT DRIVE IN WITH MY LEGS TO GO UP AND PULLING WITH MY ARMS TO STAY IN

GJYEPR7zE1w_2 0 AS I MENTIONED I'M USING THIS PLAIN BROWN FRAME
GJYEPR7zE1w_3 0 BUT ONE THING YOU WANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS WHEN YOU USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT HAS A SLOW BACK YOU HAVE TO COME AROUND THE SIDE AND AGE ALL OF THIS
GJYEPR7zE1w_4 0 IF YOU'RE USING A FLATTER FRAME AND WHITE OR FRAME THAT DOESN'T HAVE MOLDINGS OR ANYTHING LIKE THIS YOU CAN DO A LITTLE MORE WITH IT AS FAR AS YOUR NAIL HOLES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
GJYEPR7zE1w_5 0 YOU CAN EVEN PUT AN OLD RUSTY HINGE ON IF YOU WANT IF YOU'RE GOING FOR REAL RUSTIC LOOK
GJYEPR7zE1w_6 0 IN THIS CASE YOU WOULD JUST PAINT THE EDGES ALSO
GJYEPR7zE1w_7 0 ON THIS ONE THAT ACTUALLY HAS AN INSET HERE
GJYEPR7zE1w_8 0 THAT CAN BE PAINTED THE DIFFERENT COLOR
GJYEPR7zE1w_9 0 YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING HERE JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT COLOR
GJYEPR7zE1w_10 0 AND YOU WOULDN'T SAND IN THIS AREA BECAUSE THAT'S A LOW SPOT
GJYEPR7zE1w_11 0 NOW ANOTHER OPTION THAT YOU HAVE IS USING A FRAME LIKE THIS THAT ALREADY HAS THIS IS THE PEWTER MOLDING
GJYEPR7zE1w_12 0 AND I CHOSE TO LEAVE IT SO OVER
GJYEPR7zE1w_13 0 THIS ORIGINALLY WAS JUST A LITTLE FRAME
GJYEPR7zE1w_14 0 I CAME IN AND PREPARE THIS FRAME AND THEN I PUT A CRACK WILL FINISH ON IT THE WAY AROUND AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL OF THE TAIL AND I DID ON THIS BECAUSE THIS DRESSES UP THE FRAME ENOUGH

GNp4efsnNZ0_4 0 IT HAS A BUCKET IS GOING TO TAKE AND SLIDE IT UNDERNEATH THE DRAIN COCK ON THE RADIATOR
GNp4efsnNZ0_5 0 THE RADIATOR IS GOING TO HAVE A DRAIN COCK ON EITHER THE RIGHT OR LEFT LOWER CORNER
GNp4efsnNZ0_6 0 OR MAYBE A SMALL HOLE IS CONNECTED TO IT AND WHAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE IS A WING NUT NORMALLY MADE OF PLASTIC SCREWED INTO A DRAIN TO ON THE RADIATOR
GNp4efsnNZ0_7 0 THIS ONE HAPPENS TO BE LOCATED ON THE RIGHT SIDE RIGHT DOWN HERE
GNp4efsnNZ0_8 0 AS YOU CAN SEE IT DOES LOOK LIKE A WING DAY OR WING NUT AND THE SCREWS INTO THE DRAIN ON THE BOTTOM OF THE RADIATOR
GNp4efsnNZ0_9 0 THIS IS THE DRAIN CLOSE THAT IS ATTACHED TO IT
GNp4efsnNZ0_10 0 NOW SOME VEHICLES DO HAVE IT SOME VEHICLES DO NOT

GVox5SW_Jj8_2 0 AS YOU CAN SEE HERE WE HAVE A ARE SENDING SET UP
GVox5SW_Jj8_3 0 AND WE HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS
GVox5SW_Jj8_4 0 WE HAVE VARIANCE STRING

GVox5SW_Jj8_8 0 THIS THIS THIS BE FINE FOR ME
GVox5SW_Jj8_9 0 NOW WHAT I WANT TO DO IS ON A SEMI VARIANCE AT SIXTEEN
GVox5SW_Jj8_10 0 MY STRENGTH LET'S SET IT UP JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE
GVox5SW_Jj8_11 0 SO THAT I'M NOT THAT HARD
GVox5SW_Jj8_12 0 I GO AROUND OR A FOURTEEN
GVox5SW_Jj8_13 0 THERE WE GO
GVox5SW_Jj8_14 0 BECAUSE THE HIGHER YOU GO THE MORE LINES IS REALLY GOING TO PUT IN THERE

GVox5SW_Jj8_20 0 WE HIT OK AND THERE WE GO
GVox5SW_Jj8_21 0 AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE A LOT OF TEXTURE GOING ON HERE ARE FIBERS OF FILTER THAT WE JUST APPLIED
GVox5SW_Jj8_22 0 SO LET'S GO UP HERE AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO
GVox5SW_Jj8_23 0 GOING TO POLISH RIGHT HERE FOR RIGHT NOW WILL PICK UP IN THE NEXT PART
GNJ7z3m8V_k_1 0 THE FIRST THING WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SOME SHAPES THAT ARE GOING TO GO AROUND THE LAMP SHADE
GNJ7z3m8V_k_2 0 THIS PART OF THE PROJECT CAN EITHER BE DONE BY FREEHAND DRAWING OR YOU CAN JUST TAKE SOME SHAPES THAT ARE PRINT IT OUT FROM A COMPUTER OR YOU CAN TAKE A SOME I'M HARD IMAGES AND AGAIN JUST TRACE AROUND THEM LIKE A PIECES OF A PUZZLE CAN GIVE YOU A NICE SHAPE SOMETIMES
GNJ7z3m8V_k_3 0 BUT WE'LL GO AHEAD AND MAKE DIFFERENT IMAGES
GNJ7z3m8V_k_4 0 NOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOT MAKE THE IMAGES TO BIG WE DON'T WANT THEM TO TAKE ANY TAKE UP ANY LARGE AREAS OF THE LAMP SHADE THE WHOLE FILL THE WHOLE OF NICE THING ABOUT TO THE HOLE
GNJ7z3m8V_k_5 0 ONE OF THE NICE FEATURES ABOUT THE DOING THE LAMP SHADE IS IT'S MADE UP OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT SMALL IMAGES GO ALL THE WAY AROUND THE LAMP SHADE
GNJ7z3m8V_k_6 0 SO WE DON'T WANT ANY ONE IMAGE TAKING UP TOO MUCH SPACE ON THAT WHEN THEY BECOME TRACED ONTO THE PLASTIC ON THE PLASTIC SHEET WHICH IS GOING TO BE THE THE LAMP SHADE ITSELF
GNJ7z3m8V_k_7 0 IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU PUT THE IMAGES ON THE PAPER BECAUSE THE PAPER CAN BE MOVED AROUND AND AND WHEN IT'S TRACED ONTO THE THE SHEET OF PLASTIC IT COULD BE YOU COULD JUST BE MOVED AROUND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EXACTLY AS IT LOOKS ON THE PAGE
GNJ7z3m8V_k_8 0 SO WE MAKE DIFFERENT SHAPES HERE I'M USING A THEME OF LIKE KIND OF A BEACH WATER THEME I HAVE SOME FISH STARFISH AND DIFFERENT THINGS THAT USUALLY FIND AROUND THE OCEAN AROUND THE BEACH
GNJ7z3m8V_k_9 0 ALSO BE SURE THAT YOU DRAW SOME IMAGES THAT CAN BE COLOR COLORED NICELY EASILY COLORED AND YOU CAN ALSO USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT COLORS WHEN YOU WANT TO DECORATE THEM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE ALSO THE PROJECT STAND OUT THAT THE IMAGE IS GOING TO BE HAVE SOME SOME NICE LIVELY BRIGHT COLORS
GNJ7z3m8V_k_10 0 FOR THE SHEET OF PLASTIC THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING THESE IMAGES ON WILL PROBABLY BE ABOUT TEN OR TWELVE IMAGES
GNJ7z3m8V_k_11 0 NOW THAT YOU CAN USE THE SAME IMAGE OVER AGAIN BECAUSE AS BEING TRACED
GNJ7z3m8V_k_12 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE USING A SHEET OF PLASTIC ABOUT ABOUT TWENTY FOUR INCHES IN LENGTH ROLLED AROUND SO FOR THAT YOU'LL NEED ABOUT TEN DIFFERENT IMAGES TO GO TEN TO TWELVE IMAGES TO GO AROUND
GNJ7z3m8V_k_13 0 SO I'VE SHOWN YOU ABOUT HOW TO MAKE SOME IMAGES ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND GET THEM READY TO BE TRANSFERRED ONTO THE SHEET OF PLASTIC
ghWwS5ev6xk_1 0 ONE WAY TO GET READY FOR DOING THINGS SPINS ON A WAVE OR A HOLE IS TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT YOU DO YOUR FORWARD SWEET STROKES AND STANDING WATER OR EVEN YOUR REVERSE SWEET STROKES AND FLAT WATER
ghWwS5ev6xk_2 0 WHAT I WANT TO DO THIS THE STROKE IS WINE BACK UP AT THE END
ghWwS5ev6xk_3 0 AND WHAT I'M LOOKING THAT YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO IS KEEP MY TORSO POWER IN FRONT OF MY KAYAK
ghWwS5ev6xk_4 0 SO WHEN I WIND UP FOR THE BEGINNING THE SWEEP I HAVE A LOT OF POWER PULLING THE BOAT INTO THIS SIDE AS I ON ONE MY TORSO COME BACK TO NEUTRAL AND IT IS THAT POWER
ghWwS5ev6xk_5 0 IF I GO ANY FURTHER BACK I'M ACTUALLY COUNTERACTING THAT SPIN AND THAT'S BAD
ghWwS5ev6xk_6 0 SO I WANT TO GO FROM SIDEWAYS I CAN ACTUALLY WINE BACK UP AGAIN AT THE TAIL AND MY SWEET AND THIS WILL KEEP THE BOAT PULLING AROUND
ghWwS5ev6xk_7 0 SO TAKE A LOOK A LINED UP TO THE MIDDLE AND THEN REALLY LINED UP AND THAT REALLY ALLOWS THE BOAT TO KEEP COMING AROUND KEEP GOING
ghWwS5ev6xk_8 0 AND THIS IS THE STROKE THAT THE PROS ARE USED WHEN YOU SEE I'M DOING CLEANS BEEN DONE WAIVER CLEAN SPINS IN A HOLE
ghWwS5ev6xk_9 0 THE MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH IT THE MORE SNAP YOU GET
ghWwS5ev6xk_10 0 AND YOU'RE REALLY NOTICE THAT ENERGY BUILDING UP AT THE END OF YOUR SWEEP STROKE
ghWwS5ev6xk_11 0 FOR AND SEE HOW THE BOAT ACCELERATES RIGHT AT THE VERY END FOR
G_homXRgREU_1 0 THE NEXT STYLE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO AND YOU USE THE DISCRETION HIDDEN IS A KEYHOLE NECKLINE

gtiaeinVHZ8_1 0 LET'S TALK ABOUT WEAKNESS IN RESISTANCE
gtiaeinVHZ8_2 0 WHEN YOU ATTACK OR WHEN YOU DEFENDING YOUR POKEMON HAS A WEAKNESS THE RESISTANCE
gtiaeinVHZ8_3 0 WE'RE LOOKING AT IT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR CLOSE TO THE RETREAT COST
gtiaeinVHZ8_4 0 IF YOU LOOK MY POKEMON HERE AS A WEAKNESS OF FIGHTING TIGHT AND HAS A RESISTANCE TO MELT TYPE OF ON
gtiaeinVHZ8_5 0 UNLESS THERE'S A NUMBER BESIDE IT THE WEAKNESS OR RESISTANCE IS AUTOMATICALLY TWENTY
gtiaeinVHZ8_6 0 IN THIS POKEMON IS CASE I ACTUALLY RESISTANCE TO METAL OF THIRTY
gtiaeinVHZ8_7 0 SO LET'S SAY MY OPPONENT ATTACKS ME WITH THIS NEW TO READ WHICH IS ACTUALLY A MIDDLE TYPE POKEMON
gtiaeinVHZ8_8 0 IT MAKES IS ATTACK SCRATCH FOR <UNK>
gtiaeinVHZ8_9 0 THEN ALL I HAVE A RESISTANCE OF THIRTY THAT MEANS THAT WILL TAKE ANY DAMAGE IT ALL BECAUSE I TAKE THIRTY OFF WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS THEY ATTACK WITH
gtiaeinVHZ8_10 0 IF YOU IS ATTACKING WITH FORTY FOR FORTY POINTS OF DAMAGE AND I WOULD ONLY TAKE TEN BECAUSE MY RESISTANCE IS THIRTY THIS IS WHERE THE MATH IS A BIG PART
gtiaeinVHZ8_11 0 IF THE POKEMON THAT IS ATTACKING IS ONE THAT I HAVE A WEAKNESS TO THAT MEANS THAT I AUTOMATICALLY TAKE TWENTY MORE DAMAGE THE WHAT IT OUT WHAT WHAT THE POKEMON IS ATTACKING WITH

H2f7L6y9X6Y_1 0 HI THIS IS JON AND IN THIS CLIP I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT EMERGENCIES
H2f7L6y9X6Y_2 0 IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A PHONE HANDY AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WIRE ONE INTO YOUR SHOP YOU COULD ALWAYS INVEST IN A GOOD CORDLESS PHONE OR YOU CAN USE YOUR CELL PHONE
H2f7L6y9X6Y_3 0 ADDITIONALLY YOU CAN POST THE EMERGENCY NUMBERS NEXT TO YOUR PHONE SO THAT YOU KNOW WHO TO CALL IF YOU NEED HELP
H2f7L6y9X6Y_4 0 IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO LET SOMEONE KNOW THAT YOU ARE WORKING IN THE SHOP SO THAT IF THEY DON'T HEAR FROM YOU IN A WHILE THEY CAN ALWAYS COME CHECK ON YOU
H2f7L6y9X6Y_5 0 ADDITIONALLY YOU CAN INSTALL THOSE INTERCOM SYSTEMS IN YOUR SHOP SO THAT YOU CAN EASILY CONTACTS SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE
H2f7L6y9X6Y_6 0 YOU ALWAYS WANT TO HAVE A COUPLE OF GOOD ABC FIRE EXTINGUISHERS HANDY IN YOUR SHOP AND MAKE SURE TO ALWAYS KEEP THEM FULLY CHARGED
H2f7L6y9X6Y_7 0 AND IF ALL ELSE FAILS MAKE SURE YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT EXITS OUT OF YOUR WOOD SHOP
H2f7L6y9X6Y_8 0 ADDITIONALLY YOU ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR FIRST AID KIT LOCATED IN A CENTRALIZED LOCATION AND IT IS FULLY STOCKED
H2f7L6y9X6Y_9 0 MUCH OF THE TIME IT'S BETTER JUST A STOCK IT YOURSELF THEN TO GO OUT AND BUY ONE THAT WAY YOU DO KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED
H2f7L6y9X6Y_10 0 AND LASTLY ANOTHER GOOD TIP IS TO ALWAYS HAVE A CHAIR IN YOUR WOOD SHOP AND KEEP IT NEAR BOTH THE PHONE AND THE FIRST AID SUPPLIES
GeeOYGUqjP0_1 0 NOW IF YOU WANT TO WORK WITH COILS THAT YOU'RE NOT QUITE READY TO DO IT FREE HAND ARE FREE FORM YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND USE A MOLD
GeeOYGUqjP0_2 0 A REALLY GOOD TYPE OF MATERIAL TO USE FOR A MOLD IS AN EARTHENWARE PLANTER OR BOWL
GeeOYGUqjP0_3 0 IT WICKS AWAY MOISTURE SO THE POT IS GOING TO DRY EVENLY
GeeOYGUqjP0_4 0 BUT ANY MULTI WORD
GeeOYGUqjP0_5 0 YOU CAN MAKE A PLASTER MOLD ANYTHING YOU WANT TO USE
GeeOYGUqjP0_6 0 AND IT'S THE SAME BASIC IDEA
GeeOYGUqjP0_7 0 I'VE ALREADY DONE THE BOTTOM
GeeOYGUqjP0_8 0 BUT I'M GOING TO LAY THE COILS IN AND JUST PRESS WITH MY THUMB ALL THE WAY AROUND THE POT
GeeOYGUqjP0_9 0 NOW ON THIS TIGHT ONLY THE INTERIOR IS GETTING SMOOTHED

gSBb8mSo9Ao_1 0 I'M JENNIFER MILLER WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR REALITY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gSBb8mSo9Ao_2 0 ONE OF THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS THAT WE GET FROM FAMILIES THAT ARE NEW HOME SCHOOLING OVER SKEPTICAL HOME SCHOOLING IS HOW YOU TEACH THOSE THINGS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT
gSBb8mSo9Ao_3 0 IF YOU FEEL HIGH SCHOOL GEOGRAPHY AND YOU CAN'T NAME ALL THE STATES AND CAPITALS AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SEVEN CONTINENT'S ARE THEN HOW ARE YOU POSSIBLY GOING TO TEACH GEOGRAPHY TO YOUR CHILD AT HOME
gSBb8mSo9Ao_4 0 THE QUESTION THAT CAN BE ASKED IN RESPONSE TO THAT IS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CAPITAL BRAZIL IS HOW WOULD YOU FIND OUT
gSBb8mSo9Ao_5 0 WHAT WAS YOUR ANSWER
gSBb8mSo9Ao_6 0 WHICH YOU SEARCH ON GOOGLE
gSBb8mSo9Ao_7 0 WHICH YOU GO TO THE LIBRARY
gSBb8mSo9Ao_8 0 WHAT YOU USE ANALYSIS
gSBb8mSo9Ao_9 0 ANY OF THOSE ANSWERS WOULD NOT ONLY PROVIDE THE ANSWER TO WHAT THE CAPITAL BRAZIL IS THAT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE THE ANSWER TO HOW TO TEACH GEOGRAPHY WHEN YOU YOURSELF DON'T KNOW IT
gSBb8mSo9Ao_10 0 IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY PERSON TO TEACH THE WHOLE BODY CUMIN KNOWLEDGE TO ANOTHER PERSON
gSBb8mSo9Ao_11 0 IT GROWS EXPONENTIALLY EVERY YEAR
gSBb8mSo9Ao_12 0 AND IN EDUCATED PERSON IS NOT SOMEONE WHO KNOWS ALL OF THE BURDEN FACTS ABOUT EVERY SUBJECT
gSBb8mSo9Ao_13 0 AN EDUCATED PERSON IS SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO LEARN AND WHO LIVES A LIFE STYLE OF LEARNING
gSBb8mSo9Ao_14 0 SO IF YOU ARE AN EDUCATED PERSON AND YOU KNOW HOW TO LEARN AND YOU WILL KNOW HOW TO FIND THE INFORMATION THAT YOU DON'T KNOW
gSBb8mSo9Ao_15 0 ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE TEACH THE SUBJECT THAT WE ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH AND WE'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH IS BY FINDING SOMEONE WHO DOES KNOW HOW TO TEACH THOSE THINGS AND TEACHING INTO OUR CHILDREN
gSBb8mSo9Ao_16 0 DESIGNING EDUCATION IS NOT SO MUCH ABOUT WHAT TO INCLUDE AS TO WHAT NOT TO INCLUDE
gSBb8mSo9Ao_17 0 IF IT'S A PUBLIC EDUCATION A PRIVATE EDUCATION HOME EDUCATION SOMEONE HAS MADE THE DECISION OF WHAT IS IMPORTANT FOR A CHILD TO LEARN AT A CERTAIN POINT AND HOW TO TEACH IT AND WHAT IT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE OUT
gSBb8mSo9Ao_18 0 HOW MUCH YOU'RE GETTING YOUR CHILD IS NOT ABOUT KNOWING EVERYTHING AND KNOWING HOW TO TEACH EVERYTHING YOURSELF
gSBb8mSo9Ao_19 0 IT'S ABOUT CUSTOM DESIGNING THE PERFECT EDUCATION FOR YOUR CHILD AT THIS STAGE THAT HE IS AT
gSBb8mSo9Ao_20 0 IF TEACHING GEOGRAPHY SCARES YOU MAKE FRIENDS WITH YOUR ATLAS
gSBb8mSo9Ao_21 0 START DOING SOME READING ABOUT CULTURES
gSBb8mSo9Ao_22 0 START LEARNING ANY LANGUAGE
gSBb8mSo9Ao_23 0 AND BEFORE VERY LONG YOUR ENTHUSIASM FOR THE WHAT YOU ARE LEARNING WILL OVER FLOW INTO YOUR HOME SCHOOL
gSBb8mSo9Ao_24 0 AND YOU WILL FIND WAYS TO TEACH A CHILD GEOGRAPHY

gmCXgBJGCzc_5 0 YOU KNOW ANY UNIVERSAL USUALLY HAVE A GOOD BREAK CREATION PROGRAM SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO CONSIDER
gmCXgBJGCzc_6 0 SECOND THING YOU NEED TO CONSIDER IS THAT YOU DO NEED TO GO THROUGH THE POLICE ACADEMY SO YOU WOULD BECOME A FULL FLEDGED PEACE OFFICER IN UTAH SO YOU NEED TO DO THAT THAT'S TYPICALLY IF FOR MONTH PROGRAM HERE IN UTAH

GSx_C8A3iWY_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS DR SUSAN JEWELL AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WAYS TO LIVE WITH MENOPAUSE
GSx_C8A3iWY_2 0 NOW IN THIS PARTICULAR CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANT H.R.T TREATMENT THERAPY THAT MOST WOMEN AH PRESCRIBED BY THE PHYSICIANS WHEN THEY ENTER MENOPAUSAL STAGE IN THEIR LIVES
GSx_C8A3iWY_3 0 NOW WHAT'S A CHALK TEA
GSx_C8A3iWY_4 0 LOOK AT THE SPORT AND THAT LET'S LET'S SEE WHAT THE DEFINITION OF H.R.T WELL H.R.T IS AN ACRONYM FOR HOME MONO REPLACEMENT THERAPY
GSx_C8A3iWY_5 0 NOW THIS IS A VERY POPULAR TREATMENT THAT THE DOCTOR'S PRESCRIBE
GSx_C8A3iWY_6 0 IT'S A PRESCRIBE PROGRAM TO TREAT A HOMEOWNER AND BALANCE ASSOCIATED WITH MENOPAUSE
GSx_C8A3iWY_7 0 NOW THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT THINGS TO DO TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT H.R.T THERAPY
GSx_C8A3iWY_8 0 NOW YOU CAN GET A CHALK TEA THERAPY IN TWO WAYS
GSx_C8A3iWY_9 0 YOU CAN GET WITH ONLY EACH HUGE IN A IN THE THERAPY THAT'S ALL THAT MEANS THAT THERE ARE MANY PRESCRIBE EACH AND FOR YOU FOR THE TREATMENT OR YOU CAN GET COMBINATION OF HORMONES IN THE THERAPY WHICH IS E SHOOTING COMBINED WITH OTHER PARTICULAR HOMEOWNERS LIKE PROGESTERONE E STRING PROGESTIN AND TESTOSTERONE
GSx_C8A3iWY_10 0 THIS COMBINATION IS ACTUALLY A IT MORE RECOMMENDED BECAUSE THEN YOU GO TO DECREASE YOUR A LONG EXPOSURE OF EACH AND A HIGH EXPOSURE TO EACH IN IN THE BODY OR ON THE POSE EACH AND BECAUSE OF THE POSE EASTERN PUT YOU A HIGH WRIST DEVELOPING CERTAIN CANCERS THAT INDIVIDUAL CANCER
GSx_C8A3iWY_11 0 SO COMBINATION THERAPY IS USUALLY THE NUMBER ONE RECOMMENDATION FOR WOMEN ENTRY MENOPAUSE
GSx_C8A3iWY_12 0 NOW A CHALK TEA IS GOOD BECAUSE IT HELPS THE WOMEN IN DEVIATE SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS OF MENOPAUSE AND THAT IS IT HELPS WITH MOOD SWINGS AND AND HOT FLASHES
GSx_C8A3iWY_13 0 IT ALSO HELPS WOMEN TO AND MAINTAIN SOME MEMORY BECAUSE MENOPAUSE WOMEN START TO LOSE MEMORY AND SELL AND THAT'S A ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS
GSx_C8A3iWY_14 0 SO AT A CHALKY HELPS WITH THAT AND IT HELPS WITH ONE OF THE CONDITIONS THAT WAS THE FINEST PAJAMA DRYNESS
GSx_C8A3iWY_15 0 THAT IS A VERY COMMON A SYMPTOMS THAT WOMEN EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY GO THROUGH MENOPAUSE
GSx_C8A3iWY_16 0 NOW WHAT IS A OF A HOMEOWNER REPLACEMENT SCHEDULE
GSx_C8A3iWY_17 0 WELL THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT SKETCHES OF THE DOCTOR CAN PUT YOU ON
GSx_C8A3iWY_18 0 AND THAT IS CALLED THE SLACK A SCHEDULE ALL THE CONTINUOUS SCHEDULE
GSx_C8A3iWY_19 0 NOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THAT IN ALMOST LIKE A SCHEDULE YOU'LL BASICALLY TAKING ISO JEN HORMONE TWENTY FIVE DAYS IN A MONTH AND THEN ON THE TWELFTH DAY THEY GOING TO ADD PROGESTERONE AND WITH THIS PARTICULAR A TREATMENT SCHEDULE YOU'RE GOING TO EXPOSE THE WOMENS CONNECTS EXPERIENCE A PERIOD WILL BLEEDING LIKE A MONTHLY PARROT MINSTRELS PERIOD
GSx_C8A3iWY_20 0 SO THAT'S INCH USED YOU KNOW IS SYNTHETIC LAYS NOT NATURAL SO THE OTHER A SCHEDULE IS A CONTINUOUS SCHEDULE WHICH MEANS THAT YOU BASICALLY TAKING EACH AND EVERY
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_1 0 HI I'M AARON GREGORY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR CAR BATTERY DIES HOW TO SELECT A NEW BATTERY AND HOW TO SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_3 0 WE'LL BEGIN BY REMOVING THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL FROM THE BATTERY AND GETTING IT OUT OF THE WAYS THAT IT DOES NOT STAY TOUCHING AND CONTACTED
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_4 0 AND THEN WE'LL REMOVE THE POSITIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_5 0 WHILE I WAS TO LOOSE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_6 0 THIS TERMINAL MIGHT STAY CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IF YOU DON'T BEND IT OUT OF THE WAY A LITTLE IN WHICH CASE WE MIGHT STILL HAVE THE SPARKING PROBLEM
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_7 0 SO AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S THOROUGHLY OUT OF THE WAY
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_8 0 AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO THIS ONE LOOSENING AND SOMETIMES THIS TERMINAL BE STUCK REALLY TIGHT
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_9 0 NOW THEY MAKE A TOOL CALLED THE BATTERY TERMINAL HOLE OR THAT HAS A THREAD ROD AND A LITTLE PLUNGER IN YOU SCREW IT DOWN AND LIFT THE THING UP
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_10 0 WITHOUT HAVING THE SPECIAL TOOL THERE'S A SLIGHT HERE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_11 0 IF YOU OPEN THE THREAD IT ROD AND USE A TOOL TO SPREAD THESE THESE EARS THEY GET PINCHED TOGETHER AND THEN YOU LIFT TO THE FRONT OF THE TERMINAL GENTLY
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_12 0 YOU CAN USUALLY GET IT OFF
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_13 0 WHEN YOU'RE REMOVING TERMINALS BOTH SIDES LOOK LIKE A BOLT
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_14 0 BUT YOU WANT TO TURN THE NUT SIDE AND LOOSEN THE NUT SIDE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_15 0 BECAUSE THE SQUARE BOWL THAT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO ROTATE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_16 0 IT STAY STATIONARY
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_17 0 AND LOOSEN IT A LITTLE MORE THAN YOU THINK YOU NEED TO BUT DON'T TAKE THE NOT ALL THE WAY OFF
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_18 0 THAT WAY YOU HAVE SOME CLEARANCE TO SPREAD THE LEAD OPEN TO GET THE TERMINAL OFF THE BATTERY
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_19 0 TRY TO TWIST IT
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_20 0 IF IT WON'T TWIST YOU MIGHT NEED TO OPEN THIS GAP YOUR SLIGHTLY WITH YOUR WRENCH OR A SCREWDRIVER
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_21 0 YOU OPEN THE OPEN THE RING AND MAKE IT LARGER
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_22 0 AND THEN TWIST IT
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_24 0 IF NECESSARY TRY A LITTLE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_25 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO PRY THE TERMINAL UP LIFT EVENLY SO THAT YOU DON'T BREAK THE LEAD TERMINAL OFF OF THE BATTERY
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_26 0 NOW THAT THE TERMINALS ARE OFF THE BATTERY WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANY SIGNS OF WHITE CORROSION OR BROWN RUST
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_27 0 AND THE SAME GOES FOR THE INSIDE LOOP ON THE CAR AND IF THE TERMINAL THE FEMALE SIDE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_28 0 TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE THAT HAVE A WIRE BRUSH THAT STICKS AND THEN YOU ROTATE TO CLEAN THE FEMALE SIDE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_29 0 AND THEN THERE'S ALSO MATING FEMALE WIRE BRUSH THAT GOES OVER THE TERMINAL THAT YOU CAN TWIST
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_30 0 SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_31 0 I LIKE TO USE A WIRE BRUSH AND SCRUB THE TERMINALS UNTIL I SEE SHINY CLEAN LEAD

HE5tiPfCQIo_4 0 WHAT THEY DO IS WHEN YOU'RE PAINTING WITH THE ROLLER IS IT'S INTONATION DID GOAL IN PAIN ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TAPE LINE WHEN YOU'RE REALLY SHOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THE MORE PAINT YOU PUT ON THE TAPE YOU CREATE A SEAL SO THAT WHEN YOU PULL THE TAPE BACK YOU WIND UP PULLING THE PAINT AND MESSING UP A LOT OF GOOD WORK
HE5tiPfCQIo_5 0 SO YOU REALLY WANT TO PAINT TO ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH AWAY FROM YOUR TAPE LINE AND THEN FINISH THAT FAR WITH THE BRUSH
HE5tiPfCQIo_6 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO ALWAYS USE SMOOTHLY THESE EASY STROKES AND BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVER PAINT YOUR ROPE PREPARATION LINE

gyuT7GyYraA_1 0 MY NAME IS CHRISTINE MARQUETTE AND I'M A REGISTERED DIETITIAN WITH THE AUSTIN REGIONAL CLINIC AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO BUY VALLEY FREE PRODUCTS
gyuT7GyYraA_2 0 SALLY'S OR A CHEMICAL THAT ARE TYPICALLY FOUND IN PLASTICS THEY CAN BE USED TO INCREASE THEIR FLEXIBILITY
gyuT7GyYraA_3 0 BUT THEY'RE ALSO FOUND IN A VARIETY OF OTHER PRODUCTS
gyuT7GyYraA_4 0 PERSONAL CARE ITEMS FOR EXAMPLE THEY CAN BE FOUND IN NAIL POLISH DEODORANT HAIRSPRAY PERFUMES VARIOUS TYPES OF PAINTS
gyuT7GyYraA_5 0 THEY'RE ALSO FOUND IN PESTICIDES IN IN PLASTICS THINGS LIKE PVC PIPES PVC THAT'S ALSO USED IN FLOORING IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS
gyuT7GyYraA_6 0 THE REASON WHY THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE INTEREST AND FINDING PRODUCTS THAT DON'T HAVE VALLEYS IS BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN SOME RESEARCH SHOWING THAT THERE'S INCREASED RISK OF BURST BIRTH DEFECTS LIVER CANCER KIDNEY PROBLEMS ANOTHER HORMONAL IMBALANCES I'M LABORATORY ANIMALS
gyuT7GyYraA_7 0 SO FOR THIS REASON A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED WITH THEIR EXPOSURE TO BALANCE
gyuT7GyYraA_8 0 ANOTHER CAUSE OF CONCERN IS THAT THE CDC DID A RANDOM SAMPLE OF ADULT LEMON OF CHILDBEARING AGE AND FOUND THAT A LOT OF THEM HAD I THINK IT IS OVER SEVENTY PERCENT HAD MORE THAN THE RECOMMEND LEVEL OF KALI CIRCULATING IN THEIR BLOODSTREAM
gyuT7GyYraA_9 0 BECAUSE THIS PARTICULAR CHEMICAL IS QUITE UBIQUITOUS IT'S FOUND EVERYWHERE
gyuT7GyYraA_10 0 SO ONE OF THE WAYS THAT YOU CAN GO ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT YOUR PRODUCTS ARE VALLEY THREE IS SPECIFICALLY LOOK IN THE INGREDIENTS FOR THAT PARTICULAR WORD
gyuT7GyYraA_11 0 THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT ESTERS IT MAY BE A MULTI SYLLABLE WORD THAT ALWAYS LOOK FOR IF VALLEY AS THE ENDING
gyuT7GyYraA_12 0 THERE MAY ALSO BE SOME THAT ARE JUST USING STRAIGHT ABBREVIATIONS
gyuT7GyYraA_13 0 THE ABBREVIATIONS TO LOOK FOR THE B D E HP
gyuT7GyYraA_14 0 THAT STANDS FOR DIE TO EXEL HEXCEL
gyuT7GyYraA_15 0 VALLEY ANOTHER ABBREVIATION IS D I TEPEE
gyuT7GyYraA_16 0 THAT STANDS FOR DIET FOSSIL THE AXLE
gyuT7GyYraA_17 0 OUR LIGHT AND THEN D I IN P
gyuT7GyYraA_18 0 THAT STANDS FOR DIE ALSO NANO VALLEY
gyuT7GyYraA_19 0 SO IF YOU SEE ANY OF THOSE ABBREVIATIONS YOU KNOW THAT THAT PARTICULAR PRODUCT STILL HAS VALLEYS IN IT
gyuT7GyYraA_20 0 MANY MANUFACTURERS TO MAKE NAIL POLISH AND HAIRSPRAY THOSE KIND OF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS ARE VERY HAPPY TO ADVERTISE THAT THEY HAVE PRODUCTS THAT ARE
g50rCJZrX0k_1 0 HI MY NAME IS JOHN THAN A BROKEN AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I WANT YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT BEGINNING ENCAUSTIC PAINTING
g50rCJZrX0k_2 0 THE HOP TOOLS THAT I MENTIONED THAT YOU NEED TO USE THIS EUROPEAN STYLE METHOD OF ENCAUSTIC PAINTING WOULD START WITH THE MAIN TOOL WOULD BE AN IRON LIKE THIS TRAVEL IRON SIZE
g50rCJZrX0k_3 0 IT IS DESIGNED FOR ENCAUSTIC PAINTING
g50rCJZrX0k_4 0 YOU COULD TRY TO FIND OUT ON A SMALL IRON AT HOME TO TRY THIS BUT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO STEAM IRON THAT HAVE HOLES IN THE SURFACE AND YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO TEFLON COATED IRON
g50rCJZrX0k_5 0 AND THE OTHER TOOL WOULD BE A STYLUS WHICH HAS A A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT POINTS THAT CAN BE PUT IN THE FRONT ALL OPERATING AT A LOW TEMPERATURE AROUND TWO HUNDRED DEGREES
g50rCJZrX0k_6 0 SO DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS LIKE A WOOD BURNING TOOL THAT WOULD BE MUCH TO HOP TO WORK WITH WITH WAX AND ACTUALLY COULD CAUSE THE WAX TO CATCH ON FIRE
g50rCJZrX0k_7 0 THE THING ABOUT THIS TRAVEL IRON IS THAT IT CAN BE REASSEMBLED INTO A HOT PLATE SO YOU CAN WORK WITH HOT PAPER INSTEAD OF USING IT AS AN IRON
g50rCJZrX0k_8 0 AND THEN ANOTHER THING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO LOOK AT IS THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF WAXES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE
g50rCJZrX0k_9 0 THESE PARTICULAR WAXES COME IN THREE DIFFERENT SETS OF COLORS AND ALL OF THIS COMES FROM THE OTHER ONES
g50rCJZrX0k_10 0 IF YOU'LL NOTICE THESE ARE QUITE SMALL SIZES OF THESE BLOCKS
g50rCJZrX0k_11 0 A TRADITIONAL AND CAUSING PAINTER NEEDS HUGE BLOCKS OF WAX PUT IN POTS AND MELT AND THEY'RE FOR IT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THIS PROCESS
g50rCJZrX0k_12 0 WHEN YOU GET ALL THROUGH PAINTING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO PROTECT YOUR PAINTING WITH THE SEALER OF SOME KIND AND THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY KINDS OF SEALERS YOU COULD USE
g50rCJZrX0k_13 0 ANOTHER TOOL THAT I USE IS A HOT AIR GOTTEN TUBE TO BLOW THE WAX AROUND
g50rCJZrX0k_14 0 NOW THIS IS A REAL COMMERCIAL MODEL THAT I GOT FROM SEARS BUT I LIKE IT BECAUSE I CAN DIAL THE TEMPERATURE IN EXACTLY THE WAY I WANT IT AND ALSO CONTROL THE AIR FLOW
g50rCJZrX0k_15 0 WHEN I STARTED I HAVE TO USE A HAIR DRYER WHICH WAS OKAY BUT IT'S A LOT OF A OR AND NOT ENOUGH HEAT AND THEN THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED EMBOSSING GUN THAT SCREW THIS THIS SCRAP WORKERS USE AND AGAIN THAT'S TOO MUCH HEAT AND I'M NOT HERE YOU CAN WORK TO TOGETHER BUT THAT GETS TO BE A LITTLE CUMBERSOME SO AT SOME POINT YOU MIGHT INVEST IN A HEAVIER DUTY TOOL LIKE THIS
g50rCJZrX0k_16 0 AND THAT PRETTY MUCH COVERS THE TOOLS
GGqBF3C0vak_1 0 IF YOU CAN'T TEACH YOUR DOG TO WORK ON A TREADMILL SO THEY CAN GET SOME EXERCISE AND YOU HAVE A SMALL AREA WHICH TO EXERCISE YOUR DOG OR I'M PLEASANT WHETHER THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO DO THE EXERCISE INSIDE FIRST YOU WOULD WANT TO ACCLIMATE YOUR DOG TO THE APPARATUS
GGqBF3C0vak_2 0 YOU WANT YOUR DOG TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH STANDING ON THE TREADMILL AND BEING AROUND THE TREADMILL MAYBE HEARING THE SOUND OF THAT RUNNING BEFORE YOUR DOG IS ACTUALLY STANDING ON THE TREADMILL WHEN IT STARTS TO MOVE
GGqBF3C0vak_3 0 SO YOU MIGHT BEGIN BY OKAY UP TEACHING YOUR DOG TO GET UP ON THE TREADMILL AND STANDING THERE AND THEN BEING ABLE TO GET BACK OFF OF THE TREADMILL THIS GIRL BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY WORK UP TO THE POINT WHERE YOU TURN THE TREADMILL ON IN YOUR DOG BEGINS TO WALK
GGqBF3C0vak_4 0 THIS IS AN ACTIVITY THIS POTENTIALLY FEAR INDUCING FOR YOUR DOG SO YOU WANT TO WORK SLOWLY AND TRY NOT TO HAVE ANY ACCIDENTS WHERE YOUR DOG ACTUALLY IS THROWN FROM THE TREADMILL WHICH WOULD MAKE YOUR DOG MUCH MORE WHERRY ABOUT PUTTING FOOT ON IT AGAIN
GGqBF3C0vak_5 0 YOU WANT TO WORK VERY SLOWLY INITIALLY GETTING THEM ONTO THE TREADMILL THEN RUNNING IT VERY SLOWLY SO YOUR DOG UNDERSTANDS THEY HAVE TO WALK ALWAYS BEING EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS KEEP ALL FOUR FEET ON THE TREADMILL
GGqBF3C0vak_6 0 NOW REMEMBER THAT DOGS WILL WORK TYPICALLY WITHOUT QUITTING WHEN THEY'VE GOTTEN TO TIRED SO YOU WANT TO BE VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE OF YOUR DOG'S HEALTH THEIR HEART HEALTH AND WHEN TO STOP HOW LONG THAT THEY CAN EXERCISE AND THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THING TO WORK WITH A PROFESSIONAL AND WITH YOUR VETERINARIAN

H4x2NwdisV0_15 0 I PURCHASED THIS NEW FILTER OF THE SAME SIZE
H4x2NwdisV0_16 0 IN ADDITION THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT VARIATIONS YOU CAN GET WITH FILTERS DEPENDING ON IF YOU WANT TO FILTER OUT ALLERGENS OR ANYTHING ELSE
H4x2NwdisV0_17 0 WHEN YOU INSTALL IT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AIR FLOW INDICATOR IS POINTED IN THE CORRECT DIRECTION AND INSTALL YOUR NEW FILTER JUST IN THE REVERSE AS YOU TOOK THE OLD ONE OUNCE

h9PawU0t-ys_1 0 OFTEN TRIPODS TYPICALLY HAVE A ROUGH WATER SWIM AND THAT'S WHEN THE HALLMARK SO BE OFFERED TRIATHLON
h9PawU0t-ys_2 0 TO PREPARE FOR THAT THERE'S REALLY NOTHING YOU CAN DO OTHER THAN SWIMMING ROUGH WATER
h9PawU0t-ys_3 0 IF YOU HAVE A LOCAL TRAVEL ON CLUB IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A LAKE WHEN YOU'RE AT THE BEACH PUT ON YOUR WETSUIT GET OUT THERE AND FEEL THAT FEELING OF THAT WATER HIT NIA AND EITHER DRIVING THROUGH THE WAVES AND BREAK INTO THE OTHER SIDE OR JUST ROLLING WITH IT AND GET COMFORTABLE WITH IT
h9PawU0t-ys_4 0 THE MORE TIME YOU SPIN SWIMMING A WET SUIT UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS YOU'LL FEEL SAFE AND YOU'LL FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE
h9PawU0t-ys_5 0 THE WET SUIT WILL GIVE YOU A LOT MORE COMFORT THAT SITUATION BECAUSE OF THE ADDED BUOYANCY
h9PawU0t-ys_6 0 SWIMMING IN A WET SUIT IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN SWIMMING WITHOUT ONE
h9PawU0t-ys_7 0 YOU'LL PROBABLY USE ONE TO TWO STROKES LAST FOR LENGTH YOU'LL GLIDE MORE AND YOUR RIDE HIGHER IN THE WATER
h9PawU0t-ys_8 0 SO YOU CAN TAKE IT INTO THE POOL AND SWIM A BIT IN IT JUST TO GET ACCUSTOMED TO IT FEELS VERY DIFFERENT
h9PawU0t-ys_9 0 IT'S A FISH AND ADD THE PORCELAIN WHERE YOU ARE THE MORE YOU AGAIN TIME WITH THE WET SUIT
h9PawU0t-ys_10 0 IF YOU HAVE REALLY GOOD BODY POSITION ALREADY THE WET SUIT WILL PICK UP A LOT OF TIME BUT MOST PEOPLE WILL SEE A THREE TO FIVE SECONDS PER HUNDRED IMPROVEMENT
h9PawU0t-ys_11 0 AND THAT'S A REALLY NICE THING
h9PawU0t-ys_12 0 ANOTHER NICE THING OF COURSE IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO WEAR WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO RUN A BIKE IN UNDERNEATH THE WET SUIT AND THEN JUST PEEL IT OFF AND BE READY TO GO
h9PawU0t-ys_13 0 SO EVEN THOUGH YOU LOSE A BIT OF TIME TAKING A WET SUIT OFF AND GAIN IT BY HAVING THAT YOU'RE ON UNDERNEATH
h9PawU0t-ys_14 0 SOME OTHER SPECIFICS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OPEN WATER SWIMMING IS YOU NEED TO GET USED TO STARTING FAST
h9PawU0t-ys_15 0 IT'S REALLY EASY TO GET LOW OLD INTO THE GROUP YOUR WITH SO YOU WANT TO GET OFF THE LINE QUICK AND YOU CAN PRACTICE THAT IN SWIMMING BY DOING SOME FAST FIFTIES RIGHT BEFORE YOU DO YOUR LONG SETS ARE SOME THINGS LIKE THAT
h9PawU0t-ys_16 0 TO GET OUT AND QUICKLY SETTLE DOWN INTO YOUR RHYTHM YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST KIND OF EASE INTO THE THING YOU GET INTO A SLOW GROUP
h9PawU0t-ys_17 0 IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO A LAKE TO SWIM WITH A LOCAL TRIATHLON CLUB OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND PRACTICE OPEN WATER SWIMMING IT'S A GREAT THING TO DO YOU CAN PRACTICE DRAFTING OFF SOMEBODY WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SWIM RIGHT CLOSE BEHIND AND AGAIN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS JUST BEST EXPERIENCE BY BY DOING IT
h9PawU0t-ys_18 0 SOME OTHER THINGS YOU CAN PRACTICE AND POOL SLIDING AND AND OPEN WATER SWIM EVERY SIX OR EIGHT STROKES YOU NEED TO CHOP THE STORES STROKE SHORT AND STICK YOUR HEAD UP
h9PawU0t-ys_19 0 AND STAYING ON COURSES THE WHOLE ANOTHER ASPECT OF OPEN WATER SWIMMING
h9PawU0t-ys_20 0 SO TRY TO PICK SOMETHING ON THE SHORELINE NOT THE BOOTY THAT YOU'RE SWIMMING FOR BUT A BOAT RAMP OR HOME OR LAMP HOLE OR SOMETHING SO THAT IF YOU'VE GOT A C OF BRIGHT ORANGE CAPS IN FRONT OF YOU THAT YOU STILL KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SWIMMING FOR
h9PawU0t-ys_21 0 SO THOSE ARE SOME REAL KEY AND SPECIFIC THINGS FOR WHEN YOU TACKLE THAT OPEN WATER SWIM

g524tYzDE0Y_1 0 HI I'M MATT CAIL AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A SCARECROW COSTUME
g524tYzDE0Y_2 0 THEN WE COME TO SOCKS
g524tYzDE0Y_3 0 NOW THERE ARE TWO LINES OF THINKING FOR SOCKS AND SCARECROW
g524tYzDE0Y_4 0 ONE OF THEM IS THAT SOCKS SHOULD BE BRIGHTER COLORS
g524tYzDE0Y_5 0 RED AND WHITE STRIPES
g524tYzDE0Y_6 0 THAT SORT OF THING FOR SCARECROW
g524tYzDE0Y_7 0 IT'S KIND OF AN ARIES WE CAN BE A LITTLE BRIGHT INTO YOUR PHONE SCARECROW BODY
g524tYzDE0Y_8 0 I'VE NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD THAT
g524tYzDE0Y_9 0 AND I LIKE TO KIND OF GO MORE TRADITIONAL
g524tYzDE0Y_10 0 I MEAN SCARECROWS OR OUTSIDE
g524tYzDE0Y_12 0 SO I ACTUALLY LIKE TO HAVE KIND OF THICKER MORE COTTONY SOCKS
g524tYzDE0Y_13 0 GENERALLY IN MORE SUBDUED SHADES
g524tYzDE0Y_14 0 SUCH AS A HAVING THIS IN BLACK AND GRAYS OR ALSO BROWNS
g524tYzDE0Y_15 0 EVEN LIGHT BROWN TO PROBABLY WORK
g524tYzDE0Y_16 0 ON THIS IS ALSO GREAT BECAUSE THE THICKER COTTON SOCKS WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO KIND OF STUFF MORE THINGS INTO THE SCARECROW LATER ON WHICH WE'RE GOING TO GET TOO
g524tYzDE0Y_17 0 OR AS A THIN SAY DRESSED SOCK WON'T YOU WE'RE NOT REALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO STUFF SOMETHING IN THERE
g524tYzDE0Y_18 0 IT ALSO COULD GET LIKE A CHIEF YOU TRIED TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
g524tYzDE0Y_19 0 SO FOR SOCKS I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU KNOW HAVING A GREAT IN BLACK SHADES TO HAVE THEIR
g524tYzDE0Y_20 0 AND THEN IN ADDITION OTHER THINGS YOU CAN THINK OF I'M YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE YOU COULD IF WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE SOCKS
g524tYzDE0Y_21 0 SOME SCARECROWS DON'T HAVE FEET AT ALL
g524tYzDE0Y_22 0 BUT OF COURSE YOUR HUMAN YOU HAFFEY
g524tYzDE0Y_23 0 SO YOU NEED SOME SOCKS
HiwtELMng_A_1 0 AS YOU DO RODENT IS THAT FAIRLY SIMPLE MANEUVER IN SERIES THAT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO PULL OFF
HiwtELMng_A_2 0 AND ALL IT IS IS INVADING YOUR OPPONENT'S ATTEMPT TO TAKE YOUR BLADE
HiwtELMng_A_3 0 SO IF YOUR OPPONENT TRIES TO BIND OR TO BEAT YOUR BLADE AND YOU SUCCESSFULLY AVOID CONTACT COMPLETELY WHILE MAINTAINING YOUR RIGHT OF WAY THEN YOU PULL OFF A SUCCESSFUL
HiwtELMng_A_4 0 SO OF PART OF THE DIFFICULTY AND PULLING OFF ONE NOT JUST OF WAITING OF VERY QUICK MOVEMENT BY YOUR OPPONENT ON YOUR BLADE BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT FOR IT TO FOR THE BEATER AND I'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED RIGHT AWAY
HiwtELMng_A_5 0 SO MY ARM IS STRAIGHT AND IT HAS TO REMAIN STRAIGHT FOR ME TO CONTINUE TO PULL UP THIS MANEUVER
HiwtELMng_A_6 0 SO MY OPPONENT IT TENDS TO BE MY BLADE AND I DISENGAGE BEFORE SHE MAKES CONTACT I'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND OF COURSE SINCE I HAVE MAINTAIN THAT RIGHT AWAY AND AVOID HER TEND TO TAKE IT FROM ME I WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT IMMEDIATELY WITH THE REST
HiwtELMng_A_7 0 YOU CAN I DIDN'T HAVE TO BE DISENGAGE A CAN OF MADE IN A LOT OF WAYS
HiwtELMng_A_8 0 I MIGHT TRY TO PAY OVER THE BLADE
HiwtELMng_A_9 0 I CAN ALSO DO SEVERAL IN A ROW AS LONG AS I MAINTAIN THAT RIGHT AWAY
HiwtELMng_A_10 0 SO IF SHE'S TRYING DIFFERENT MANEUVERS AND I MANAGING TO EVADER EACH TIME OF COURSE IT'S MOVING MUCH FASTER THAN THAT AND THEN AS SOON AS I SEE AN OPENING FOR AS LONG AS I CAN AVOID HER BLADE AND KEEP MY ARMS STRAIGHT I CAN MOVE IN FOR THRUST
HiwtELMng_A_11 0 LET'S SHOW HOW THAT WORKS WITH A LITTLE PLATE ON THE ACTION
HiwtELMng_A_12 0 OKAY DEMONSTRATING THE MOVES FROM HERE I PUT IT TENDS TO BE MY BLADE IT COMING I CAN DISENGAGE IN TIME AND THEN MOVE IN FOURTH REST WHILE I STILL HAVE RIGHT AWAY
HiwtELMng_A_13 0 OR ONCE AGAIN MY POINTER FEEL ON LINE AND MY ARM IS COMPLETELY EXTENDED BUT IF YOU TENDS TO BINDER BEAT AND I HAD BANISHED ACTUALLY AVOID HER LEG THAT I COULD COME IN FOR A PACK
HiwtELMng_A_14 0 IF OUR BLADE HER REALLY DOES MAKE CONTACT WITH MINE THEN I THEN I IRIS LOSING RIGHT AWAY BEING CANDIDATES BEING PARRIED AND OF COURSE THAN DID A THAN THE MANA ABILITIES MIND IN MY OPPONENT'S MOST LIKELY TO SQUIRT TOUCH
HiwtELMng_A_15 0 SO I'M PULLED OFF CORRECTLY WHEN YOU CAN AVOID YOUR OPPONENT'S BLADE AND THEY'RE TEXTING ATTEMPTING TO TAKE IT FROM YOU CAN BE USEFUL AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT SEQUENCES

gHnSOjlj-o4_12 0 I DROPPER AMPS ARE GOING TO BREAK IT FIRST SO WE BROKE IT I DROP IT FILL IT IN THERE YOU HAVE IT THAT'S HOW TO USE FILLS IN FLASH
gEMxnLl9bf0_1 0 HI I'M A LOT OF PEOPLE CHOOSE DIFFERENT TYPES OF METAL FRAME LIKE THIS ONE RIGHT HERE IS A METAL FRAME
gEMxnLl9bf0_2 0 YOU COULD USE ANY METAL FRAME YOU WANT AS LONG AS THE BASE OF THE BED HAS A CENTER SUPPORT SYSTEM UNDERNEATH IT
gEMxnLl9bf0_3 0 THAT'S THE ONLY REQUIREMENT FOR YOUR MATTRESS THAT IT HAS A CENTER SUPPORT ON A QUEEN IN A KING SIZE MATCHES
gEMxnLl9bf0_4 0 BUT THIS IS NOT GET OFF OR ANY EXTRA COMFORT OR IT'S NOT GOING TO HURT YOUR MATTRESS AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THE ADEQUATE SUPPORT UNDERNEATH IT
gEMxnLl9bf0_5 0 I'VE HEARD THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO LEAVE THE PLASTIC ON THEIR MATTRESS IT'S REALLY NOT A GOOD IDEA
gEMxnLl9bf0_6 0 THE NEXT DESIGN WORK WITHOUT THE PLASTIC IT DOES KEEP YOUR BACK CLEAN SOMETIMES BUT YOUR BED IN THE MATERIALS IN IT NEED TO BREED
gEMxnLl9bf0_7 0 SO IT CAN CAUSE CONDENSATION TO GET INTO YOUR BED SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU TAKE THE PLASTIC OFF
gEMxnLl9bf0_8 0 HOWEVER THE NECKLACE INDUSTRIES COME UP WITH A NEW MATTRESS ATTACH THAT BREEZE BUT IT ALSO DOES NOT LIKE ANY LIQUID GO THROUGH TO THE MATTRESSES AT ALL
gEMxnLl9bf0_9 0 IT ALSO PROTECTS THE BED FROM DUST MITES
gEMxnLl9bf0_10 0 AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
gEMxnLl9bf0_11 0 SO IT'S IT'S IN ITS HAS ENOUGH ROOM IN IT SO THAT IT CAN FRIED AND LET THE MATTRESS BREATHE UNDERNEATH IT BUT THEN AGAIN IT DOESN'T LET WATER THROUGH OR ANY LIQUID OR DUST MITES SO THIS ARE THE YOUR BODY SWEATER ANYTHING LIKE THAT
gEMxnLl9bf0_12 0 SO A GOOD MATTRESS PAD IS REALLY WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
gEMxnLl9bf0_13 0 YOU'RE NOT REALLY LOOKING FOR KEEPING THE PLASTIC ON
gMoqAzB3ODY_2 0 MY NAME'S KIP AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gMoqAzB3ODY_3 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BUILDING A TROUBLESHOOTING AND REPAIRING YOUR OWN AUDIO CABLES MICROPHONE CABLES AND SO FORTH
gMoqAzB3ODY_4 0 THE FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT THE TOOLS THAT YOU'LL NEED TO DO THIS WORK
gMoqAzB3ODY_5 0 YOU'LL NEED A SOLDERING IRON
gMoqAzB3ODY_6 0 NOW IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO LOTS AND LOTS OF YOUR ON WORK YOU CAN GET ONE THAT DOES NOT HAVE THIS POWER BASE AND IT'S JUST A HANDLE LIKE THIS
gMoqAzB3ODY_7 0 YOU CAN GET THEM WITH A VARIABLE HE CONTROL KNOB HERE OR WITHOUT BUT YOU WANT TO GET IT NICE AND QUALITY ONE THAT I WILL DO THIS WORK
gMoqAzB3ODY_8 0 HAVING THE VARIABLE TEMPERATURE CONTROL AND THIS WORKSTATION MAKES WANT A NICE PLACE TO PUT YOUR SOLDER IRON WHEN IT'S HOT AND TO YOU CAN CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE VERY PRECISELY FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORK
gMoqAzB3ODY_9 0 FOR MAKING AUDIO CONNECTORS CONNECTIONS IT IS NOT NEAR IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A VERY PRECISE CONTROL OVER HEAT AS IT WOULD BE IF YOU ARE WORKING ON CIRCUIT BOARDS WHERE OVERHEATING COMPONENT CAN DAMAGE IT QUITE EASILY
gMoqAzB3ODY_10 0 YOU'LL NEED A MOISTEN SPONGE
gMoqAzB3ODY_11 0 THE MOISTEN SPONGE WE USE TO CLEAN THE TIP OF OUR SOLDER IRON
gMoqAzB3ODY_12 0 AND YOU'LL NEED SOME WIRE CUTTERS YOU'LL NEED RESIN CHORDS SOLDER AND SOME FORM OF WIRE STRIPPERS
gMoqAzB3ODY_13 0 THIS HAS A CRIMPER AND EVERYTHING INVOLVED BUT THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD USE IS THE WIRE STRIPPER
gMoqAzB3ODY_14 0 AND THEN IT IS NICE TO HAVE SOME WAY TO REMOVE THE SOLDER OF FROM THE OLD JOINT
gMoqAzB3ODY_15 0 THIS IS A SUCKING TYPE SOLDER REMOVING PROCESS OR WE HAVE THIS BRAIDED TIGHT
gMoqAzB3ODY_16 0 ANOTHER TOOL THAT I BUILT MYSELF WOULD BE THIS CLAP WAYS YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A CLAMP LIKE THIS AND IT'S VERY SIMPLE CLAMP
gMoqAzB3ODY_17 0 I PUT A COUPLE PIECES OF WEATHER STRIPPING A COUPLE PIECES OF METAL AND SOME SPRINGS AND THIS WAS THE FIRST ONE I BUILT
gMoqAzB3ODY_18 0 I HAVE A BETTER WHEN I KEEP IN MY MY CASE THAT'S GOT A LITTLE STIFFER SPRINGS
gMoqAzB3ODY_19 0 BUT IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO HOLD YOUR CONNECTOR WHILE YOU WORK ON IT AND ONE SIZE FITS ALL THIS WAY
gMoqAzB3ODY_20 0 OTHER THAN THE WIRES AND CONNECTORS OF COURSE THESE ARE ALL THE TOOLS THAT YOU'LL NEED TO GET STARTED BUILDING YOUR OWN AUDIO CABLES AND REPAIRING THEM
G6OvjQrDwQc_1 0 THEY'RE QUITE A FEW MATERIALS NEEDED FOR THIS PROJECT BUT YOU'LL FIND THAT MOST OF THEM YOU PROBABLY HAVE IN YOUR HOUSE ALREADY
G6OvjQrDwQc_2 0 I'M GOING TO NEED PIPE CLEANERS
G6OvjQrDwQc_3 0 WE'RE ALSO GOING TO NEED NEWSPAPER NEWSPAPER STRIPS
G6OvjQrDwQc_4 0 I'M GOING TO USE A CHEESE CLOTH WHICH CAN BE FOUND AT YOUR HARDWARE STORE
G6OvjQrDwQc_5 0 SOMETIMES NOT SO MUCH YOUR ART SUPPLY STORE BUT HARDWARE STORE IS THE BEST PLACE TO FIND THAT
G6OvjQrDwQc_6 0 WE'RE ALSO GOING TO NEED A BUCKET FOR MIXING YOUR PAPER MACHINE
G6OvjQrDwQc_7 0 FOR PAPIER-MACHE I LIKE TO USE CELT FLOUR AND SOME WATER
G6OvjQrDwQc_8 0 FOR DECORATING OUR LIZARD WE'RE GOING TO USE ACRYLIC PAINT SOME TEMPERA GLITTER PAINT AND WE'LL ALSO BE USING SOME SEQUENCE AND SOME GOOGLY EYES
G6OvjQrDwQc_9 0 MOST OF THESE THINGS YOU CAN FIND EITHER IN YOUR HOUSE LIKE THE FLOWER THE SALT WATER NEWSPAPER
G6OvjQrDwQc_10 0 PIPE CLEANERS PAINTS SEQUINS THINGS LIKE THAT YOU CAN FIND AT YOUR ART SUPPLY STORE
G6OvjQrDwQc_11 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO HAVE SOME WATER HANDY SO THAT YOU CAN WASH OUT YOUR BRUSHES SOME GLUE AND POSSIBLY SOME SCISSORS
hcYJxvCIoAQ_1 0 WELCOME TO THIS SEGMENT OF FACIAL YOGA CALLED THE SHIFTING FACE
hcYJxvCIoAQ_2 0 BUT WE'RE FIRST GOING TO DO IS JUST RUB THE FINGERS TOGETHER
hcYJxvCIoAQ_3 0 I'M BORROWING THIS PARTS OF THE EXERCISE FROM THEATER TRAINING
hcYJxvCIoAQ_4 0 WE'RE THINKING THAT THE FACE AS MANY TIMES CALLED A MASK
hcYJxvCIoAQ_5 0 AS WE RUN THE HANDS TOGETHER WITH AND PUT THEM ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND AS WE MOVE IN THE DIRECTION UP AND DOWN WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE ALL OF THE MUSCLES IN THE FACE
hcYJxvCIoAQ_6 0 SO TAKE IT NICE AND SLOW AND EASY
hcYJxvCIoAQ_7 0 WE FIRST THINK OF JUST TAKEN A NICE BREATH RELAXING THE FACE COMPLETELY HEY
hcYJxvCIoAQ_8 0 ESPECIALLY AS POSSIBLE NOTHING GOING ON THERE'S NO EXPRESSION
hcYJxvCIoAQ_9 0 AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE EXPRESSION TO A DOWNWARD FACE
hcYJxvCIoAQ_10 0 SO GENTLY WE FEEL THAT THE EYEBROWS START TO ROLL DOWN
hcYJxvCIoAQ_11 0 THE FACE THE EYES LOOK DOWN THE DRAW THE CHEEKS THE LIPS EVERYTHING IS LOOKING DOWNWARD
hcYJxvCIoAQ_12 0 SO YOU CAN DRAWL ALL THE ENERGY DOWN
hcYJxvCIoAQ_13 0 IF SOMEONE WALKS BY TO SEE YOU THEY MIGHT LAUGH THAT YOU BUT THAT'S ALRIGHT
hcYJxvCIoAQ_14 0 STAY WITH THIS FEELING OF WE REALLY DRAWING THE ENERGY DOWN
hcYJxvCIoAQ_15 0 AND THEN HOLD IT FOR AS LONG AS YOU'RE COMFORTABLE
hcYJxvCIoAQ_16 0 OR WE LEAVE SLOWLY THE CHIN THOSE FACE THE LIPS THE JOY ALL OF THE CHEEK BONE AND THEN AGAIN YOUR RETURNING TO NEUTRAL
hcYJxvCIoAQ_17 0 NEXT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE HANDS FROM THE RIGHT
hcYJxvCIoAQ_18 0 WE'RE GOING TO SLIDE THE FACE TO THE LEFT
hcYJxvCIoAQ_19 0 AGAIN IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE JUST MAKING FUNNY FACES
hcYJxvCIoAQ_20 0 HOWEVER YOU CAN DEEP IN THIS BY RECOGNIZING WHAT WE'RE REALLY SEEING IN OUR SELVES IS OUR OWN NATURAL NAILS
hcYJxvCIoAQ_21 0 WHERE EXPLORING JUST LIKE WE DO IN THE BODY HOW DOES THE FACE STRETCH
hcYJxvCIoAQ_22 0 AND WE'RE JUST SIMPLY GOING TO TAKE THE LINES OF ENERGY ALL THE WAY TO THE SIDE
hcYJxvCIoAQ_23 0 SO IT'S A ZIP THE FAST WOMEN OR SOMETHING DRAWING ALL THE ENERGY INCLUDING THE ARTIST TO THE SIDE
hcYJxvCIoAQ_24 0 REALLY HOLDING ALL OF THE INTERVIEW NEW LOWERS ROLLS
hcYJxvCIoAQ_25 0 THE MOST STRANGE THE FOREHEAD EVEN AND THEN GENTLY REALLY COME BACK TO NEUTRAL RELAX
hcYJxvCIoAQ_26 0 PROBABLY THE MOST AWARENESS HAPPENS WHEN YOU LET GO
GAP9uRYfTLk_1 0 THE NEXT NOW WE'RE GOING TO TIE IS THE LARGEST
GAP9uRYfTLk_2 0 THAT MANY OF US MIGHT KNOW THIS NOT AS WELL
GAP9uRYfTLk_3 0 IT HAS TO BE A FAIRLY NATURAL NOT TO TIE IT OR JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE SOMETHING WORK
GAP9uRYfTLk_4 0 YOU START BY FOLDING THE RIP IN HALF AND YOU CAN TAKE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO TIGHT AROUND
GAP9uRYfTLk_5 0 IT'S OFTEN TIGHT AROUND A HOOK OR A HOOP AND THEN YOU TAKE THE TWO ENDS OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE ROPE SLIDE THEM THROUGH THE LOOP AND GO LIKE SO
GAP9uRYfTLk_6 0 I HAVE A LARGE SAID KNOT IS AN OIL IS THE MOST STABLE NOT BUT AWAY YOU CAN MAKE IT MORE STABLE IS SIMPLY BY PASSING ONE INTO THE ROPE THROUGH AGAIN AND THIS KIND OF MAKES IT FIND UP A LITTLE BIT WHICH CAN ALSO BE MORE DIFFICULT TO UNTIE BUT IT'S A LOT MORE STABLE
GfQLBy4gfTM_1 0 NOW THAT WE'VE GOT THIS OR ONE GO BACK TO CLEAN IT UP ON THE INSIDE PUSHING DOWN ALL THE WHILE
GfQLBy4gfTM_2 0 AND I THINK IT LOOKS LIKE A BOWL THAT I'M NOT DOING IT
GfQLBy4gfTM_3 0 KEEP ON PUSHING DOWN
GfQLBy4gfTM_4 0 IT
GfQLBy4gfTM_5 0 OR SO
GfQLBy4gfTM_6 0 ALRIGHT IT I'M ALRIGHT AND CHECK IT
GfQLBy4gfTM_7 0 AT THIS POINT I LIKE TO TAKE MY POTTER'S KNIFE AND MAKE IT REALLY DRY DOWN THERE THE SCRAPE OFF ALL THE FIFTH OF ALL THE EXTRA CLAY
GfQLBy4gfTM_8 0 ADD DRY IT UP WITH THIS A DRIER THIS CLAY IS IT THE BETTER OFF YOU'RE GOING TO BE WHEN IT COMES TO THIS NEXT MOVE WE'RE GOING TO DO WHERE I'M GOING TO MAKE A RIM AND IT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS MAKES IT THROUGH THE FIRING PROCESS WITHOUT WARPING AND ALL THE COMPRESSION THAT WE DID IS GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET TO THE FIRE PROCESS WITHOUT CRACKING
gVFBabbrWxM_1 0 ONE OF THE TRICKS THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO LEARN BEFORE DOING THE FAKIE OLLIE DISASTER IS YOU'LL NEED TO KNOW HOW IT FEELS TO HAVE YOUR BACK WHEELS ABOVE THE TRANSITION AND ABLE TO GET OUT FROM THIS POSITION
gVFBabbrWxM_2 0 IT'S EASY TO GET INTO THIS POSITION BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS BY ROLLING BACKWARDS WITH TOO MUCH SPEED AND YOU END UP BLOCKING OVER
gVFBabbrWxM_3 0 BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IS BE ABLE TO PUT WEIGHT ON YOUR FRONT OF YOUR BOARD OR YOUR NOSE AND ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PURPOSEFULLY PICK UP THE BACK WHEELS AND CLEAR THE COPING AND BE ABLE TO ROLL BACK DOWN THE TRANSITION AND HAVE CONTROL
gVFBabbrWxM_4 0 SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS ROLL BACKWARDS UP THE QUARTER PIPE OR MANY WRAP THAT YOU'RE SKATING AND LET YOUR BACK WHEELS ROLL ON TOP
gVFBabbrWxM_5 0 AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE LOCKED IN THIS POSITION IT'S BEST TO LOCK BECAUSE THAT WAY YOU DON'T YOU'RE NOT TEETERING LOCK WITH YOUR WHEELS AGAINST THE COPING
gVFBabbrWxM_6 0 AND THEN PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR NOSE AND LET THE BACK WHEELS PICKUP PAST THE COPING AND CLEAR IT COMPLETELY AND THEN ROLL DOWN THE TRANSITION
gVFBabbrWxM_7 0 THIS LEARNING THIS MOTION WILL GET YOU SET UP SO THAT WHEN YOU DO A BIG OLLIE OR CRACK THE FAKIE DISASTER AND LAND YOU'LL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'LL NEED TO DO WHEN YOU ROLL BACK IN AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE TRICKS YOU'LL NEED TO LEARN BEFORE DOING FAKIE OLLIE DISASTER
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_1 0 HI I'M LUCY SPAIN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE HERE TO TALK ABOUT CHEERLEADING JUMPS AND TUMBLING
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_2 0 ONE OF THOSE BASIC TUMBLES WE CAN START WITH IS A CARTWHEEL
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_3 0 NOW A CARTWHEEL IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S A BASE FUNDAMENTAL TO BUILD ON AND GET YOUR CONFIDENCE SET FOR DOING ANY SORT OF TUMBLE AT ALL
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_4 0 IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOU KEEP YOUR ARMS AT A LOCKED POSITION AT ALL TIMES WHEN YOU'RE ON THE GROUND
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_5 0 ANOTHER VARIATION OF THE CARTWHEEL IS A ROUND OFF
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_6 0 NOW THE ROUND OFF IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE CAR WILL EXCEPT FOR WE HAVE A TORSO TURN AND INSTEAD OF OUR LEGS HITTING THE FLOOR ONE BY ONE OUR LEGS WILL HIT THE FLOOR TOGETHER
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_7 0 NOW WHEN STARTING A PART OF THE BEST WAY TO LEARN IS BY TAPING ONLINE OF MASKING TAPE ACROSS THE FLOOR THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_8 0 ONCE YOU HAVE THAT MASKING TAPE SET YOU CAN PUT YOUR TOE ON THE LINE TO START
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_9 0 NOW THE FIRST THING THAT'S GOING TO HIT THE FLOOR IS GOING TO BE YOUR FIRST HAND
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_10 0 NOW IF YOU'RE RIGHT HANDED THAT'S WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_11 0 IF YOU'RE LEFT HANDED YOU SIMPLY TAKE THE OTHER END OF THE LINE YOU'RE GOING TO GO WITH YOUR LEFT HAND
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_12 0 IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW TO DO BOTH SIDES BECAUSE YOU MAYBE AS TO COME FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_13 0 SO ONCE WE'VE SET OURSELVES WE'RE GOING TO RAISE OUR RIGHT HAND OR LEFT HAND WHICH EVER IS GOING TO BE YOUR FIRST HIT THE FLOOR YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE IT LANDS ON THE TAPE ONE HAND TO HAND FOOT FOOT
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_14 0 AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO FOR THE CARTWHEEL
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_15 0 NOW ONCE YOU GET YOUR BASIC MASTERED YOU'RE GOING TO SPEED IT UP A LITTLE BIT SO YOU CAN GET SOME MOMENTUM BUILDING
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_16 0 NOW THE ROUTE STUFF IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE CART WITH
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_17 0 YOU DEFINITELY TO START WITH THE SAME PREPARATION IS GOING TO BE THE SAME MIDDLE FORM
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_18 0 THE ONLY THING IS ONCE OR IN THE AIR WE HAVE BOTH FEET UP WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO MEET IN TOGETHER AND DROPPING TOGETHER SO THEY ARE TOUCHING WHEN YOU HIT THE GROUND
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_19 0 NOW THE ROUND OFF IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT TUMBLING CHEERLEADING BECAUSE THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO START ALL OF OUR RUNNING TUMBLING PASS IS
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_20 0 NOW IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO PRACTICE YOUR ROUND OFF WITH SPEED AND POWER AND HEIGHT
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_21 0 SO USUALLY YOU WANT TO GET AS MUCH OF A RUNNING START AS POSSIBLE
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_22 0 YOU REALLY WANT TO GO AS FAST AS YOU CAN INTO THAT TUMBLE GET A LOT OF HOWEVER GOING AND REALLY SNAP OUT OF IT AND FROM HERE AT THE END OF OUR ROUNDS OFF IS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO DO ALL OF OUR BACK FLIPS BACK HANDSPRINGS IN FULLS
GIdUQK1Br54_1 0 HI I'M CENTER WITH ABUNDANCE
GIdUQK1Br54_2 0 THIS EVENING ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE NOW WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE CONTRAST BETWEEN WEARING SOMETHING THAT HAS
GIdUQK1Br54_3 0 MORE OF THE TRENDY LOOK AND SOMETHING THAT'S MORE CONSERVATIVE BUT A SIMILAR STYLE YOU'LL NOTICE THAT CHARMAIN BEFORE WAS WEARING A DOWN
GIdUQK1Br54_4 0 WAS IT VERY VERY TRENDY AND A LOT OF RUFFLES IT HAD A LOT OF BEADING IT HAD
GIdUQK1Br54_5 0 ON A KIND OF A A PRINT I HAD A PAISLEY PRINT SO IT REALLY WAS VERY USEFUL NOW SHE'S WEARING SOMETHING MUCH MORE TRADITIONAL SOME
GIdUQK1Br54_6 0 IN A LOT MORE CONSERVATIVE
GIdUQK1Br54_7 0 MONOCHROMATIC HOWEVER A LOT OF SIMILARITIES YOU HAVE THE ROUX SHEET
GIdUQK1Br54_8 0 GET TO CAMOUFLAGE THE TUMMY YOU HAVE A FLARED SCREWED AT THE BOTTOM WHICH AGAIN HELPS TO PROPORTION HURT
GIdUQK1Br54_9 0 AND BALANCE OR PROPORTION
GIdUQK1Br54_10 0 AND YOU HAVE WITH AT THE SHOULDER AGAIN BALANCING PROPORTIONS DRAWING THE EYE UP ALRIGHT ONE OF THE THINGS
GIdUQK1Br54_11 0 I THINK IS REALLY MARVELOUS THESE DAYS IS THAT THERE IS A LOT MORE VARIETY FOR PLUS SIZE WOMEN AS FAR AS DRESSING
GIdUQK1Br54_12 0 THE EVENING WEAR IS CONCERNED SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS VERY VERY EASY TO DO FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT FIGURE TYPES AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIZES IN ADDITION COMPANIES THESE DAYS ARE A LOT MORE CONSIDERATE HUNT OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS VERY
GIdUQK1Br54_13 0 THOUGHTFUL OF THEM IS THEY GENERALLY PROVIDE A SHAWL SO SURE MAINTENANCE
GIdUQK1Br54_14 0 ONLY WHERE THIS AS A SHAWL IN THE
GIdUQK1Br54_15 0 EVEN IF SHE NEEDED TO COVER UP A LITTLE BIT MORE OFF OR FOUR OF DOWN THAT IS ACTUALLY STRAP
GIdUQK1Br54_16 0 LISTEN DOESN'T HAVE A SLEEVE WE HAVE THE SHAWL AVAILABLE TO MAKE A LITTLE SHRUG
GIdUQK1Br54_17 0 YOU ADD A SLEEVE MAKE A JACKET ANY NUMBER OF OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE

gODs-0lceYM_3 0 NORMALLY WOULD WE WANT IT TO A BOIL AND YOU WANT TO ADD LIKE TWO PARTS SUGAR
gODs-0lceYM_4 0 AND THEN YOU WOULD STIR THE SUGAR IN TILTS DISSOLVES
gODs-0lceYM_5 0 YOU REMOVE FROM HEAT AND THEN YOU WOULD ADD THREE PARTS RUM AND ONE PART LIMON LEMON JUICE AND THEN PUT OVER ICE
gODs-0lceYM_6 0 OKAY NOW LET'S MAKE IT

gODs-0lceYM_22 0 THERE YOU GO
gODs-0lceYM_23 0 YOU'RE GOOD TO GO
hGsJiQPsACY_1 0 ANOTHER THING THAT CLIMBING AND STRESS TOWARD THE IMPORTANCE OF DOUBLE STOPPED
hGsJiQPsACY_2 0 AND WE TALKED A LOT OF A DOUBLE STUFF
hGsJiQPsACY_3 0 WE'VE GONE OVER SOME INTERVALS
hGsJiQPsACY_4 0 SO YOUR THIRD BEFORE IT'S YOUR FITS YOUR SIX
hGsJiQPsACY_5 0 THOSE ARE ALL DOUBLE STOPS
hGsJiQPsACY_6 0 SO HE BELIEVED THAT BY USING THE DOUBLE STOPS NOT ONLY IN SCALES BUT ACTUALLY TAKING THE PIECES APART AND FIND THOSE DOUBLE STOPS AND PRACTICING THOSE DOUBLE STOPS HELPED YOU LEARN THE PASSAGE THAT MUCH EASIER
hGsJiQPsACY_7 0 BECAUSE REALLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS THAT INSTEAD OF TAKING A WHOLE CHORD AND TRY TO PRACTICE A WHOLE CHORD A BREAKING UP THE CHORD INTO DOUBLE STOPS
hGsJiQPsACY_8 0 SO LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A LARGE G MINOR CHORD

-ghc0pf6KO0_4 0 SO I'VE MADE SOME NOTES HERE THEY'RE GOING TO REFER TO
-ghc0pf6KO0_5 0 EMPLOYMENT ACHIEVING ACHIEVING AWARDS HAVE TO DO WITH THE LENGTH OF SERVICE OR SAFETY AWARDS
-ghc0pf6KO0_6 0 THEY CAN NOT DISCRIMINATE TO HIGHLY COMPENSATED MUCH AS MANY OF THE PENSION ROLLS AND THE REQUIRES A MINIMUM OF FIVE YEARS SERVICE FOR THEM TO QUALIFY
-ghc0pf6KO0_7 0 AND THEN ON THE ON TOP OF THE OUT THE AVERAGE IN SUCH AWARDS CANNOT EXCEED FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS

GptTbkqR50E_5 0 NOW THIS CONTINUES ON THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BRIDAL SHOWER AND EVEN IF YOU LOSE YOUR NECKLACE YOU CAN CATCH OTHER PEOPLE SAY AND TAKE ONE OF THEIR EARS
GptTbkqR50E_6 0 AT THE END OF THE BRIDAL SHOWER THE PERSON WHO HAS THE MOST NECKLACES OR PINS WHATEVER YOU'RE USING IS GOING TO BE THE WINNER OF THAT GAME AND THEY'RE GOING TO GET A PRIZE
GptTbkqR50E_7 0 AND IT'S REALLY FUN BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH PEOPLE SAME BRIDE AND GROOM AND SAY OH I DO THAT IT'S FUNNY EVERYBODY GETS TO LAUGH AND THEY GET TO STEAL NECKLACES FROM EACH OTHER

hJD_vHdFwYs_9 0 WE'RE GOING TO YOUR PAGE
hJD_vHdFwYs_10 0 WE HAVE HEARD NEW
hJD_vHdFwYs_11 0 THEY GO AND BASICALLY JUST REALLY WORKING ON THE OUTSIDES BECAUSE THE INSIDE AIM IT IS GOING TO DO MOST OF THE WORK AND A LITTLE BIT OF BRUSHING YOU CAN GET IN THERE
hJD_vHdFwYs_12 0 IT'S JUST GOING TO BE THAT MUCH BETTER FOR THEM
hJD_vHdFwYs_13 0 AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THE INSIDE TOO MUCH
hJD_vHdFwYs_14 0 MOST OF THEIR TARTAR BUILDS UP ON THE OUTSIDE OF THEIR TEETH AND IF YOU CAN EVEN GET THAT YOU'RE DOING PRETTY GOOD
hjCSXj24vt8_1 0 LET'S TALK ABOUT TURNING YOUR DOG'S NAILS
hjCSXj24vt8_2 0 BE VERY CAREFUL TRIMMING NAILS
hjCSXj24vt8_3 0 NAILS ARE VERY TENDER THERE IS A QUICK WHICH BLEEDS IN THERE IF YOU GET TOO FAR TOO CLOSE TO IT AND ALSO PETS AND DOGS CAN BITE IF THEY'RE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE OR FEEL PAIN
hjCSXj24vt8_4 0 SO JUST ALWAYS BE VERY CAREFUL
hjCSXj24vt8_5 0 THE NEXT STEP IS TO DETERMINE THE NAIL LENGTH AND SOME NAILS ARE BLACK SOME NAILS ARE CLEAR WHICH MAKES IT A LITTLE EASIER TO IDENTIFY THE QUICK OR THE RED PART INSIDE THE NAIL
hjCSXj24vt8_6 0 NEXT YOU WANT TO IDENTIFY THE NAIL THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TRIM AND PRESS IT OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT SO THAT SEPARATES FROM THE OTHER NAILS AND YOU WANT TO USE VISUALLY IF YOU CAN SEE THE QUICK GO AWAY FROM IT ON THIS SIDE
hjCSXj24vt8_7 0 BE DELIBERATE AND QUICK YOU SHARP AND AND FAIRLY NEW TRIMMERS IF YOU CAN AND THEN WATCH FOR ANY BLEEDING
hjCSXj24vt8_8 0 IF YOU DO SCENE BLEEDING YOU STICK THE POWDER WHICH YOU CAN GET AT ANY PET STORE AND YOU SHOULD ALWAYS KEEP ON HAND IF YOU'RE TRIMMING NAILS
GSV8PEAEDTE_1 0 IN THIS FINAL FIGURE WE'RE RESTING ON ALL THE EIGHTH NOTES

hAUeqalPhWI_1 0 HI I'M TIM GIPSON AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MEASURE YOUR WINDOW FOR CURTAINS
hAUeqalPhWI_2 0 NOW WHEN YOU'RE MEASURING FOR CURTAINS IT SOME OF IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF CURTAIN THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PUT UP
hAUeqalPhWI_3 0 LET ME POINT OUT WITH THESE THESE ARE SILK SHEARS
hAUeqalPhWI_4 0 THAT IS YOU LOOK DOWN HERE AT THE BOTTOM YOU CAN SEE THEY COOL A LITTLE BIT AT THE FLOOR
hAUeqalPhWI_5 0 SO YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GOING TO FIND COMMON WITH SOAKS YEARS IS THAT YOU WANT THEM TO POOL AT THE FLOOR LIKE THIS
hAUeqalPhWI_6 0 NOW YOUR REGULAR CURTAINS WILL STOP JUST SHORT OF THE FLOOR
hAUeqalPhWI_7 0 SO THAT'S SOMETHING YOU WANT TO CONSIDER AMOUNT YOU GOT IT WHEN YOU THINK OF THE LENGTH OF YOUR CURTAINS IN AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO SLOW DOWN
hAUeqalPhWI_8 0 NOW IN THIS PARTICULAR HOME THESE HAVE NINE PUT CEILINGS IN THIS HOME SO IT'S NOT QUITE AS THE CRITICAL WHERE YOU HANG YOUR OVERALL CURVES
hAUeqalPhWI_9 0 BUT IF YOU HAVE SHORTER CEILINGS THIS IN A PUT CEILING ONE THING THAT YOU CAN DO CURTAINS CAN HELP YOU ACTUALLY MAKE THE ROOM LOOK TALLER
hAUeqalPhWI_10 0 SO WHERE WE HAVE THESE PARTICULAR CURTAINS HUM JUST A COUPLE INCHES ABOUT THREE INCHES OVER THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THE ROOM LOOK TALLER SWEET ACTUALLY COME UP TO A POINT THAT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE CROWN AND THE TOP OF THE WINDOW
hAUeqalPhWI_11 0 AND THEN THE OTHER THING YOU WANT TO CONSIDER IS HOW WIDE YOU WANT YOUR CURTAIN ROD
hAUeqalPhWI_12 0 NOW IF YOU WANT YOUR WINDOWS TO BE OPEN IF YOU'RE HANGING SOLID CURTAINS HERE YOU WANT YOUR WINDOWS TO BE OPEN THEN YOU WANT THIS CURTAIN ROD TO MAYBE EIGHT INCHES OR SO WIDER THAN THE ACTUAL WINDOW OPENING
hAUeqalPhWI_13 0 SO WITH THOSE THINGS IN MIND WILL JUST LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT A SHEER SO WE WOULD MEASURE THE LENGTH OF THE SO KNOWING THE LENGTH OF OUR SHEARS WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO SIMPLY MEASURE OUT AND WE WANT THE CURTAIN RODS SITTING ABOUT A HALF AN INCH LOWER THAN WHAT THE ACTUAL LENGTH IS
hAUeqalPhWI_14 0 SO IN THIS CASE WHEN I MEASURE UP WE'VE GOT ABOUT A G A EIGHTY FOUR INCHES SO THE ACTUAL CURTAIN LENGTH WOULD BE ABOUT EIGHTY FOR A HALF SO THAT EXTRA HALF AN INCH IS GOING TO ALLOW US THAT COOL
hAUeqalPhWI_15 0 AND THEN MEASURE THE WIDTH OF THE CURTAIN ROD IN THIS CASE SINCE THIS IS A SHEER WE WANT TO BE A LITTLE BIT WIDER SO WE'LL MEASURE OUR OPENING AND YOU WANT TO GO INSIDE DIMENSIONS INSIDE TO MENTION WE GOT THIRTY FIVE
hAUeqalPhWI_16 0 SO IN THIS CASE WE WANT OUR BRACKETS AND OUR ROD TO BE JUST A FEW INCHES LONGER THAN THAT OPENING
hAUeqalPhWI_17 0 SO I'M TIM GIPSON AND THAT IS HOW TO MEASURE FOR CURTAINS
GDUxtkCe5uA_1 0 I HAVE IT
GDUxtkCe5uA_2 0 AND THIS AND I'M WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
GDUxtkCe5uA_3 0 AND I'M TEACHING YOU PROPER CARE OF FISH TODAY AND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF FISH
GDUxtkCe5uA_4 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SECOND PROCESS OF SLACK IN YOUR TANK OUT WHICH IS CALLED A KNOT TROT SIDE
GDUxtkCe5uA_5 0 ONE IS GOING TO BE THE FIRST PART OF THE CYCLE
GDUxtkCe5uA_6 0 THE SECOND PART IS GOING TO BE THE NIGHT SKY
GDUxtkCe5uA_7 0 AND ABOUT WEAK THREE TO FOUR AS THE MONEY LEVELS COMING BACK DOWN AND I KIND OF LEVEL IS GOING TO GO UP
GDUxtkCe5uA_8 0 THEN I CAN'T GO ALL THE WAY UP PEEKING OUT AND GOT THAT DOWN
GDUxtkCe5uA_9 0 USUALLY TAKES ABOUT SIX TO EIGHT THIS PROCESS
GDUxtkCe5uA_10 0 SOMETIMES IT AND TAKE A LITTLE LONGER AND TAKE A PLATE
GDUxtkCe5uA_11 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE TO YOU NOW IS HOW TO DO AND I TRY TO IT
GDUxtkCe5uA_12 0 AS WE DID WITH YOU MIGHT THIS GOING EITHER HIT THAT I'LL THAT HAS THE SAME LITTLE WHITE LINE ON IT
GDUxtkCe5uA_13 0 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE WATER OUT OF THE TANK AND PUT INTO THAT YOU JUST LIKE WE DID ON THE MINUTE TOO
GDUxtkCe5uA_14 0 YOU CAN TELL THAT WE FEEL THAT YOU GO TO THE WHITE LINE WITH THE WATER
GDUxtkCe5uA_15 0 LETS IT THIS DOWN WE'LL GET AND I TRY TO THIS BOX WHICH IS PINK
GDUxtkCe5uA_16 0 ON IT IT HAS AND FIVE DROPS
GDUxtkCe5uA_17 0 WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL REMOVE THE CAP OFF THE BOTTLE AND I JUST PUT THE TOP BACK ON THE SHAPE OF OUR DOOR THAT COLOR
GDUxtkCe5uA_18 0 THIS JUST DUST IT TAKES FIVE MINUTES BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE SHOWING NICE BABY BLUE COLOR
GDUxtkCe5uA_19 0 AND THIS GOES FROM A NICE PRETTY BLUE COLOR TO A PURPLE COLOR THAT WE HAVE HIGH NOT TRY IT'S IN THE TANK WHICH IS JUST THE BETTER THE FISH AS WELL AS THE AMMONIA GLASS SENSE
GDUxtkCe5uA_20 0 NA TRI LEVELS AND HOW STEADY CAUTION TOO MUCH FISH THE AND TO MAYBE FISH IN THE TANK AS WELL AS AMMONIA
GDUxtkCe5uA_21 0 IF YOU HAVE AMMONIA AND I TRY AND TANK BOW THE SAME TIME THAT YOU NEED TO DO SOME MAJOR SURGERY ON YOUR TANK TO TAKE YOUR PROBLEM AND FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS
GDUxtkCe5uA_22 0 THIS IS IF YOU DON'T UNFORTUNATELY EVENLY VERTICAL TANK
GDUxtkCe5uA_23 0 SO THEY HAVE THE FISH TANK MONITOR YOUR AMMONIA AND I'VE TRIED AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK IF NOT ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS JUST TO KEEP KICK ON ANYTHING TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY TAPPING IT OKAY
H2q3JOMMNCQ_1 0 HI I'M JEN FROM CLAY CAFE AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'LL BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO TAKE YOUR CERAMIC PIECE FROM START TO FINISH
H2q3JOMMNCQ_2 0 ONCE THE PIECE HAS BEEN PAINTED AND THE DESIGNS COMPLETE THE NEXT PIECE WILL GO INTO THE PROCESS AND STAGE
H2q3JOMMNCQ_3 0 TO START THE PRODUCTS AND STAGE WE ENTER INTO THE CLEAR GLAZING
H2q3JOMMNCQ_4 0 SO THIS IS TO LOOK VERY CLEAR IT ACTUALLY HAS A PURPLISH TEND TO IT AND THE REASON THAT THE DONE IS THE MAIN FACTOR IS ACTUALLY I'D LIKE A FOOD COLORING MINERAL INTO THE GLAZE AND IT ACTS AS A VISUAL GUIDE TO THE BLAZERS WHO NEED TO COVER THE ENTIRE PIECE ENSURING EVERYTHING IS NICE AND SEALED WATERTIGHT AND OF COURSE FOOD SAFE
H2q3JOMMNCQ_5 0 SO TO START THE GLAZING PROCESS WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT OUR GLAZES VERY WELL MIX AND HAVE THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY
H2q3JOMMNCQ_6 0 A GREAT PRODUCT AND TOUCH IS A LITTLE STRANGE BUT IT WORKS REALLY REALLY GREAT FOR MIXING YOUR GLAZE IS A TOILET ACROSS BELIEVE IT OR NOT
H2q3JOMMNCQ_7 0 TOILET BRUSHES ARE REALLY REALLY GREAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE ALL THESE BRISTLES AND IT'LL SCOOP UP ANY OUT OF THE SLIDES THAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOUR GLAZE SETS
H2q3JOMMNCQ_8 0 SO YOU JUST WANT TO GIVE IT A REALLY NICE GOOD STIR
H2q3JOMMNCQ_9 0 A COUPLE OF TIMES
H2q3JOMMNCQ_10 0 AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S REALLY NICELY NEXT AND YOU'RE READY TO START GLAZING
H2q3JOMMNCQ_11 0 SOME PEOPLE WHO WILL DIP THE I'M PIECES AND DO A CLEAR GLAZE AND OTHERS CHOOSE TO PAINT IT ON
H2q3JOMMNCQ_12 0 I REALLY LIKE THE NONABRASIVE NEST DIPPING BECAUSE REALLY YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING THE PIECE IS A WHOLE LOT WHEN YOU ARE PAINTING YOUR CLEAR GLAZE ON WHAT CAN HAPPEN IS YOU AS SOON AS THE PIECE GETS WET YOU RE ACTIVATE THE PAINT AND ONE OF PAINTS REACTIVATED IT'S VERY EASY FOR YOU TO START MOVING IT WHEN YOU ARE BRUSHING IT ON
H2q3JOMMNCQ_13 0 SO TO START TO DIP YOUR PIECE WHICH IS WHAT I PREFER AS YOU'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE AND DOING A SIMPLE TILE HERE AND ACTUALLY ONLY GOING TO DIP ONE HALF FIRST AND THEN TO THE OTHER HALF
H2q3JOMMNCQ_14 0 I'LL ALSO SHOW YOU THE SAME TECHNIQUE ON A BOWL AND WE DO THAT
H2q3JOMMNCQ_15 0 WE ONLY DID TOP PIECE AT A TIME SO IT'S NOT JUST SERVE THE PAINT UNDERNEATH
H2q3JOMMNCQ_16 0 IF I'M PUTTING MY FINGERS ALL OVER THE WET GLAZES I CAN EASILY SMUDGE AND PUT MY FINGER PRINTS INTO THE PERSON'S GLAZE WHICH MOST CUSTOMERS DON'T WANT
H2q3JOMMNCQ_17 0 SO I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO TAKE THE PIECE AND DIP IT LIGHTLY AND GIVE IT A REALLY GOOD SHAKE
H2q3JOMMNCQ_18 0 SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO BLOW ON THE PIECE TO GET THE ACCESS PAINT OFF BUT I FIND SOMETIMES THAT CREATES SOME DIRT MARK SO I TEND TO JUST SHAKE THE PIECE OFF
H2q3JOMMNCQ_19 0 AND THEN IT'S COVERED AND PURPLE AND I JUST LAY IT DOWN ON THIS DRYING GRID AND IT CAN JUST SIT THERE TO DRY UNTIL IT'S READY FOR ITS NEXT STEP
H2q3JOMMNCQ_20 0 ALL THE EXCESS GLAZE NICELY DRIPS OFF ONTO THIS MAT AND WE JUST MAKE SURE THAT WE CLEAN IT PERIODICALLY SO THAT THE GLAZE DOESN'T BUILD UP AND START TO AFFECT THE BOTTOM OF THE PIECES
H2q3JOMMNCQ_21 0 NEXT WE'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO CLEAR GLAZE A BOWL
H2q3JOMMNCQ_22 0 BOWLS OR A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND IT'S AS EASY TO SHOW YOU THAT THE HALF AND HALF STEP
H2q3JOMMNCQ_23 0 SO ALL I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO TAKE THE PIECE AND I'M GOING TO DUNK IT AND GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT OF A SWOOP PICK IT UP AND MAKE IT OF COURSE GIVE IT ANOTHER SHAKE
H2q3JOMMNCQ_24 0 YOU GIVE IT A REALLY REALLY GOOD SHAKE TO GET ALL THE EXCESS GLAZE OFF BECAUSE YOU ONLY REALLY WANT A NICE THIN LAYER OF THE CLEAR GLAZE ON TO YOUR PIECE
H2q3JOMMNCQ_25 0 AND THEN YOUR PIECE WILL JUST SIT IN THE GLAZING ROCK UNTIL IT'S READY TO BE CLEAN
G83C863C5Iw_1 0 ONE OTHER WAY I LIKE TO PREPARE BEFORE GOING INTO THE DARK HIM IS TO MAKE SURE THAT IN MIND NEGATIVE IS NICE AND CLEAN

G83C863C5Iw_11 0 BEAUTIFUL AND IT SIMPLICITY THAT YOU JUST HOLD IT AND YOU TAKE YOUR NEGATIVE AND YOU JUST WIPE IT DOWN

gWkdfyqD35U_1 0 HELLO AND WELCOME TO EXPERT VILLAGE
gWkdfyqD35U_2 0 I'M PHILLIP TORIELLO FROM THE APPLE BIT THAT A CLUB
gWkdfyqD35U_3 0 BREATHING DRILLS FOR FREESTYLE REALLY QUITE IMPORTANT HELP MAXIMIZE YOUR VIDEO TO CAPACITY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY KEEP THE HEAD DOWN AND FOCUSED
gWkdfyqD35U_4 0 WHEN YOU'RE ON LAND ARE BREATHING IS COMFORTABLY AS WE WISH TO
gWkdfyqD35U_5 0 HOWEVER IN FREESTYLE AND MOST IN PARTICULAR WITH FREESTYLE YOUR FACE IS IN THE WATER AND IT'S RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE USED TO SWIMMING BUT THE MORE OFTEN YOU SWIM THE EASIER IT WILL BECOME AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO LOOSEN UP A LITTLE BIT AND ADAPT TO THE WATER ENVIRONMENT
gWkdfyqD35U_6 0 ONE VERY IMPORTANT DRILL THAT BEGINNERS SUMMER'S CAN USE IS SIMPLY IN THEIR OWN BAT HARNAGE CUSIANA SWIMMING POOL IN THAT SIMPLY PUTTING YOUR FACE THE WATER BLOWING AIR BUBBLES OUT NICE AND SLOW AND TURNING YOUR HEAD TO THE SIDE
gWkdfyqD35U_7 0 I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PARTICULAR DRILL TO HELP PEOPLE WHO AREN'T AS THESE TO SWIMMING ACCLIMATE TO THE POOL ENVIRONMENT
gWkdfyqD35U_8 0 FOR THE MORE COMPETITIVE SUMMER CLEANING DRILLS WOULD INCLUDE THE THREE FIVE SEVEN DRILL DURING WHICH YOU'LL UTILIZE THE PULL BOOT
gWkdfyqD35U_9 0 THE THREE FIVE SEVEN DRILL IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN USE AND TWENTY FIVE YARD PULL OR EVEN A FIFTEEN METER PULL
gWkdfyqD35U_10 0 BUT BASICALLY PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO HIT TO DO A LENGTH BREATHING EVERY THREE STROKES TO DO A LENGTH BEATING EVERY FIVE STROKES TO DO A LENGTH BEATING EVERY SEVEN

GGddM69-f1c_2 0 MY NAME IS LESLIE MOSELLE AND I'M FROM TAMPA FLORIDA AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE THIS IS HOW TO DO LAUNDRY
GGddM69-f1c_3 0 DELICATE CLOTHES ARE PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO BE CAREFUL WITH WHEN DRYING
GGddM69-f1c_4 0 THERE'S TWO OPTIONS FOR DRYING YOUR DELICATE CLOTHES
GGddM69-f1c_5 0 THE OPTION THAT I LIKE TO CHOOSE IS TANGY RIGHT ON
GGddM69-f1c_6 0 THIS MAY TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER WITH THIS IS GOING TO MAKE YOUR CLOTHES LOOK AS GOOD AS THEY CAN AND LAST A LOT LONGER
GGddM69-f1c_7 0 SO ONCE YOU'VE TAKEN THE TIME TO THE RIGHT SETTINGS THE BRIGHT DETERGENT IN THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE OF WATER FOR YOUR DELICATE CLOSE ONCE THEY'RE OUT OF THE WASHER ONCE THE WASHER IS DONE YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND JUST TAKE THEM DIRECTLY OUT AND HANG THEM
GGddM69-f1c_8 0 THIS PROBABLY WILL TAKE OVER NIGHT TO DRY DEPENDING ON HEAVY THAT HAVE HEADING MATERIAL IS BUT THIS WILL MAKE A YOU KNOW YOU'RE CLOSE LOOK GREAT FOR A LONG TIME THE COLORS SMALL FEET AS MUCH FROM DRYING AND EVEN IF THEY'RE COTTON OR SILK IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER RIGHT OUT OF THE WASHER YOU CAN JUST HANGING HERE ARE HANG THE MINUTE DOORWAY AND THIS GOES FOR BOTH LIGHTS AND DARK DELICATE CLOTHES
GGddM69-f1c_9 0 AND WHEN EVER NEXT IN WHATEVER STILTS THAT YOU FEEL YOU DON'T WANT TO GET DAMAGED A SCISSOR OUT OF WASH IT YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND HANG THEM UP AND LET THE AIR DRY
GGddM69-f1c_10 0 NOW THE OTHER OPTION THAT YOU CAN HAVE FOR DRYING YOUR DELICATES IF YOU DON'T WANT A WEEK THAT LONG YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO LET IT AIR DRY THERE IS FLUFF HAIR ON YOUR I'LL DRYER CYCLE
GGddM69-f1c_11 0 NOW I'LL ADD SOME DRYERS WILL SAY DELICATES ON THE DRYER ITSELF AND THAT WILL BE A ASCENDING AVAILABLE TO YOU
GGddM69-f1c_12 0 BUT ON THIS ONE YOU HAVE LEFT AIR
GGddM69-f1c_13 0 THIS WILL THIS WILL PREVENT FROM HAVING A HIGH HEAT OR TOO MUCH HEAT APPLY TO YOUR DELICATE CLOTHES
GGddM69-f1c_14 0 IT MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN A NORMAL DRYER CYCLE THAT THIS IS UP FASTER THAN AIR DRYING AND IT'S ALSO PROTECTS YOUR DELICATES FROM ANY AGE
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_1 0 HI I'M BRYAN <UNK> AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO RESTRING IN TUNE A GUITAR
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_2 0 NOW WE'VE BOIL OUR STRINGS AND YOU WANT TO LET THEM SIT AND COOL FOR A FEW MINUTES
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_3 0 AFTER THAT READY TO PUT OUR STRINGS ON
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_4 0 THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS REMEMBER HOW WE TOOK OUR BRIDGE OFF AND WE'RE CLEANING THIS ARE GOING TO PUT THE BRIDGE BACK ON
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_6 0 OKAY THE FIRST STRING YOU WANT TO PUT ON IS THE THICK A STRING THAT YOUR LOW E STRING
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_7 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE I'VE MADE A MISTAKE A PUT IN THE WRONG STRING ON THE ON THE WRONG AND WRONG SPOT AND THAT'S NOT GOOD SO MAKE SURE YOU GOT TO TAKE A STRING
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_8 0 A LOT OF STRINGS ARE COLOR CODED THESE HAPPENED TO NOT BE
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_9 0 WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE FIRST STRING ON WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE BALL AND THE STRING GOING TO PUT THAT RIGHT HERE AND THIS SLOT ON THE TAIL PIECE
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_10 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S IN THERE NICE AND SNUG
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_11 0 NOW IT'S GOING TO COME OUT AND GO RIGHT OVER TOP OF THE SADDLE SEE HOW THERE'S A LITTLE GROOVE IN THE SADDLE
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_12 0 SO IT'S IT'S IN THERE
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_13 0 NOW TO DO THE OTHER AND YOU'RE ON THE NAPE OF THE GUITAR DOWN UPRIGHT
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_14 0 IT IS WE HAVE IT LOCKED IN DOWN THERE NOW THERE'S LITTLE HOLES IN THESE TUNING PEGS I LIKE TO HAVE THE HOLES FACING NINETY DEGREES TO THE NECK SO WE'RE GOING TO INSERT THE STRING THIS WAY
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_15 0 AND YOU WANT TO GIVE YOURSELF A LITTLE SLACK TOO
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_16 0 WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE STRING IN LIKE THAT OKAY AND PULL IT IN THIS WAY
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_17 0 WHAT I WANT TO HAVE I WANT TO MAKE SURE I HAVE SOME SLACK IN THE STRING SO THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH STRING TO WRAP AROUND
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_18 0 SO NOW WE HAVE THAT IN GOING WRAP THIS BACK AROUND YOU'RE GOING TO PULL THAT NICE AND TIGHT UNDERNEATH AND PULL THAT TIGHT JUST LIKE THAT
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_19 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO PULL IT UP SEE HOW IT'S UNDERNEATH THE STRING WE BROUGHT IN AND NOW YOU WANT TO START TIGHTENING
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_20 0 YOU WANT TO TIGHTEN IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_21 0 THEN MOVE THE STRING MAKE SURE IT'S IN THE RIGHT SLOT AND THE NUT YOU WANT TO IN THE FIRST LOT
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_22 0 PULL THAT TIGHT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP PULLING THIS TIGHT AS WE'RE GOING
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_23 0 THEN YOU WIND UP CHECK IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT JUST HAS TO BE TIGHT ENOUGH THAT EVERYTHING SECURE
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_24 0 SO NOW WE HAVE OUR FOR STRING ON
hIc9x5jQhUE_1 0 AS WE AGE WE LOSE FLEXIBILITY
hIc9x5jQhUE_2 0 SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE FLEXIBILITY EXERCISES INTO YOUR ROUTINE ON A DAILY BASIS
hIc9x5jQhUE_3 0 EVER NOTICE HOW CHILDREN ARE VERY VERY FLEXIBLE
hIc9x5jQhUE_4 0 AND THEN AS YOU AGE YOU START TO LOSE THAT ABILITY TO REACH ALL THE WAY DOWN TO YOUR TOES LIKE YOU COULD WHEN YOUR YARN
hIc9x5jQhUE_5 0 IT'S IMPORTANT TO INCREASE FLEXIBILITY FOR MANY REASONS
hIc9x5jQhUE_6 0 IT HELPS BRING NUTRITION TO THE JOINT AND IT HELPS PREVENT RISK OF INJURY DURING ACTIVITIES
hIc9x5jQhUE_7 0 TO INCREASE FLEXIBILITY IT'S IMPORTANT YOU STRETCH EVERYDAY MAJOR MUSCLE GROUPS THAT YOU'VE STRENGTH AND
hIc9x5jQhUE_8 0 WHEN SHOULD YOU STRETCH
hIc9x5jQhUE_9 0 YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY STRETCH AFTER YOUR WORKOUT
hIc9x5jQhUE_10 0 STRETCHING BEFORE IS OKAY BUT IT'S REALLY NOT GOING TO HELP YOU TO REALLY INCREASE THE FLEXIBILITY AND GAIN THE FLEXIBILITY THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
hIc9x5jQhUE_11 0 SO STRETCH YOUR MAJOR MUSCLE GROUPS ACROSS THE CHEST THOSE SHOULDERS THE TRICEPS THE UPPER BACK THE LOWER BACK THE QUADS THE HAMSTRINGS THE GLUTES AND OF COURSE THE CALF MUSCLES
hIc9x5jQhUE_12 0 HOLDING YOUR STRETCHES FOR ABOUT TEN TO THIRTY SECONDS WILL BRING OPTIMAL FLEXIBILITY
hIc9x5jQhUE_13 0 IF YOU CAN HOLD HIM A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAT'S GREAT
hIc9x5jQhUE_14 0 GOING THROUGH A RANGE OF MOTION AND THEN HOLDING THE STRETCH WILL ALSO HELP

hb3_mYgx7co_1 0 OKAY BEFORE WE START FROSTING OUR BEAR WE WANT TO GET RID OF ANY CRUMBS THAT AROUND ON THE SERVING TRAY AND AROUND THE CAKE
hb3_mYgx7co_2 0 SO YOU REALLY JUST TAKE A AND NAPKIN AND BRUSH THAT OFF
hb3_mYgx7co_3 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET THESE COMES OFF SO THAT THEY DON'T GET MIXED INTO THE FROSTING WHILE YOU'RE DECORATING
hb3_mYgx7co_4 0 SO YOU CAN JUST BRUSH IT OFF LIKE THAT AND THEN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR WORK SURFACE IS ALL CLEAR OF CRUMBS
hb3_mYgx7co_5 0 WE'LL BEGIN OUR FROSTING WITH THE SIDE OF THE CAKE AND THE KEY HERE IS TO USE A LOT OF FROSTING
hb3_mYgx7co_6 0 YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE OFF FROSTING AFTER YOUR FINISHED COVERING THE CAKE
hb3_mYgx7co_7 0 YOU WANT TO USE A LOT OF FROSTING TO AVOID GETTING CRUMBS IN IN YOUR FROSTING
hb3_mYgx7co_8 0 SO WE'LL START HERE AT THE EAR AND TAKE A GOOD DOLLOP OF OF FROSTING AND JUST START BY JUST SPREADING THAT ON
hb3_mYgx7co_9 0 NOW DON'T WORRY ABOUT GETTING THIS BIG CLUMP UP HERE ALONG THE EDGE
hb3_mYgx7co_10 0 WE'LL TAKE CARE THAT LATER
hb3_mYgx7co_11 0 THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE COVER THE SIDES AND YOU DON'T GET ALL THE CRUMBS IN THERE
hb3_mYgx7co_12 0 NOW TAKE ANOTHER LARGE DOLLOP OF FROSTING AND REMEMBER ALWAYS TO FROST ON TOP OF FROSTING
hb3_mYgx7co_13 0 SO INSTEAD OF STARTING HERE WHERE YOU ENDED YOU WANT TO START A LITTLE BIT FURTHER UP ON TOP OF FROSTING AND CONTINUE SPREADING IT ALONG THE SIDE FOLLOWING THE CONTOUR OF OUR THERE
hb3_mYgx7co_14 0 ALWAYS STARTING A LITTLE BIT BACK WE'VE ALREADY FROSTED USING A LOT OF FROSTING AND WORK YOUR WAY AROUND THE CAKE SIDE SPREADING THAT FROSTING DOWN
hb3_mYgx7co_15 0 AND NOT WORRY ABOUT IT BEING GLOBBY UP HERE
hb3_mYgx7co_16 0 WE'RE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT COVERING THE SIDE AND THEN AFTER WILL GO AROUND AND SMOOTH IT OUT
hb3_mYgx7co_17 0 OKAY I'VE GONE AROUND THE CAKE AND I'M COMING UP HERE BACK AROUND THE EARS AND SPREADING ON THAT FROSTING
hb3_mYgx7co_18 0 SEE HOW I MOVE THIS BACHELOR FOLLOWING THE CONTOURS OF THE CAKE AND PUTTING ON PLENTY OF ICING OF FROSTING COMING AROUND
hb3_mYgx7co_19 0 NOW WHEN YOU MOVE YOUR SPATULA BACK AND FORTH TO SMOOTH THAT ICING ON THE SIDE YOU YOU TO SORT OF A EDGE TO EDGE MOVE
hb3_mYgx7co_20 0 THIS EDGE AND THEN BACK TO THAT EDGE
hb3_mYgx7co_21 0 AND GO AND SMOOTH AROUND THE CAKE
hb3_mYgx7co_22 0 NOW AT THIS POINT YOU CAN JUST CHECK ANY THE EDGES THAT YOUR THAT AREN'T SO SMOOTH
hb3_mYgx7co_23 0 YOU CAN CHECK ALL THE EDGES
hb3_mYgx7co_24 0 SEE I HAVE A NICE RIBBON OF FROSTING COMING UP ON THE SIDE PLENTY OF FROSTING
hb3_mYgx7co_25 0 AND IN THE CAKE IS SHAPED NICELY LIKE A BEAR
hb3_mYgx7co_26 0 NEXT WE'RE GOING TO FROST THE TOP OF THAT
grR8kJlpJ_4_1 0 ALRIGHT NOW WE HAVE ALL THE SEASONINGS AND THE BEFORE THEY GET A CHANCE TO LEARN TO GO AHEAD AND ADD A HALF A CUP OF WHITE WINE OR IF YOU LIKE AND A LITTLE LESS AND A FOURTH A CUP OF WHITE WINE VINEGAR

grR8kJlpJ_4_4 0 WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SQUEEZE IT RIGHT OVER THE TOP
grR8kJlpJ_4_5 0 AND THE REASON WHY WE DO THIS INSTEAD OF DOING IT STRAIGHT INTO OUR SAUTE PAN IS THAT YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE SEEDS HERE AND SO WE DON'T WANT ANYONE TO CHOKE ON THE SEEDS REPEATING THIS DISH
grR8kJlpJ_4_6 0 AND WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO BE STICKING OUR FINGERS AND TO PULL THEM OUT
grR8kJlpJ_4_7 0 TRY TO REDUCE THE LEMON IT WILL ADD IT TO OUR SHRIMP
GaD-KlI54ic_1 0 IT CREATES TEXTURES SO YOU CAN ALSO GO INTO IT WITH THE BRUSH

GaD-KlI54ic_8 0 YOU REALLY DO NEED TO TREAT THIS WITH A ON A FIXATIVE A SPRAY FIXATIVE
GaD-KlI54ic_9 0 ALSO THE OTHER THING TO KNOW ABOUT THIS IS THAT YOU CAN ALL BE RACES
GaD-KlI54ic_10 0 YOU CAN ERASE THAT AS LONG AS IT'S CAT DRY
GaD-KlI54ic_11 0 YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ERASE THAT
GaD-KlI54ic_12 0 ONCE YOU'VE I'M SORT OF MIXED IT WITH THE ALCOHOL YOU HAVE LOST YOUR ABILITY TO RAISE
GaD-KlI54ic_13 0 SO YOU HAVE TO KIND OF GO WITH THE FLOW BUT THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO START YOU KNOW BRINGING FLUIDITY INTO GRAPHITE
GaD-KlI54ic_14 0 IT IS ALSO A WONDERFUL WAY JUST TO GET BEAUTIFUL GRAPHITE WASH THIS

hFHolYcaJew_1 0 MY NAME IS OWEN ROTH AND IN THIS CLIP I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO CHOOSE A GOOD OUTDOOR LOCATION FOR VIDEO INTERVIEW
hFHolYcaJew_2 0 OKAY SO THERE'S A FEW THINGS YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHEN CHOOSING YOUR LOCATION FOR AN OUTDOOR INTERVIEW
hFHolYcaJew_3 0 ONE IS A ON THE SIDE OF THE WEATHER OF BECAUSE IN BAD WEATHER OBVIOUSLY RING IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH AND I NEED YOU KNOW SOME TYPE OF OVERHANGING PROTECTION
hFHolYcaJew_4 0 BUT ALSO WHAT TYPE OF WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO BE EXPECTING WITH ITS CLOUDY OR HARSH CLEARS GUYS LIKE THIS WITH HARSH ONLINE BECAUSE THAT WILL DICTATE HOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO BRING WHETHER IT MIGHT BE AN UMBRELLA OR REFLECTORS OR THINGS LIKE THAT
hFHolYcaJew_5 0 SO LIGHTING IS ONE THING A AND THAT WILL ALSO MY DICTATE WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO PUT YOUR INTERVIEW
hFHolYcaJew_6 0 WE ARE GOING TO ALWAYS WANT THE SUN BEHIND YOU IF IT'S A HARSH LIGHT LIKE NOW
hFHolYcaJew_7 0 SO IT'S THE YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO THINK OF WHAT'S GOING TO BE BEHIND THE INTERVIEW E A BASED ON WHERE THAT SOME OF ITS GOING TO BE
hFHolYcaJew_8 0 SO FOR ME I WOULD PLACED IN REALLY RIGHT HERE IN THE CHAIR AND I WOULD JUST BE A IN FRONT OF THEM INTERVIEWING THEM
hFHolYcaJew_9 0 SO THE BACKGROUND WOULD BE THIS AND THAT'LL CREATE A NICE BACKGROUND LOTS OF VEGETATION NOTHING UGLY SO THAT SHOULD BE NICE AND SOME BEHIND ME
hFHolYcaJew_10 0 SO THAT'S HOW I WOULD SET THAT UP SO YOU WANT TO THINK OF WHAT'S BEHIND THE SUBJECT AND HOW COMFORTABLE THEY'RE GOING TO BE SITTING IN THE DIRECT SUNLIGHT BECAUSE THEY MIGHT NOT WANT TO TALK FOR TWENTY MINUTES IF THEY'RE JUST SITTING UNBEARABLE HEAT
hFHolYcaJew_11 0 SO YOU WANT TO KEEP THESE THINGS AND IN MIND WHEN PICKING THE SPOT
hFHolYcaJew_12 0 ANOTHER THING OBVIOUSLY IS DONE
hFHolYcaJew_13 0 NOISE OF WHAT'S GOING TO BE LIKE
hFHolYcaJew_14 0 RATHER NOISY NEIGHBORS
hFHolYcaJew_15 0 THE NOISE THE NEIGHBORHOOD
hFHolYcaJew_16 0 EITHER PLANES FLYING OVERHEAD
hFHolYcaJew_17 0 AND YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO WANT SCALP LOCATION BEFORE YOU CHOOSE IT
hFHolYcaJew_18 0 AND SCOUT AT THE TIME THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SCHEDULE THE INTERVIEW FOR NOT A DIFFERENT A KNOT IN THE MORNING AND NIGHT IT A DIFFERENT TIME BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE THERE AT THE TIME WHEN YOU'RE SCOUTING AND YOU WANT TO BE THERE AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO HAVE THE INTERVIEW SO YOU KNOW WHAT THE NOISES A BUT NOISES CAN AND WILL OCCUR THERE BECAUSE A NOISE LOCATION IS NO GOOD
hFHolYcaJew_19 0 AND THAT THAT MIGHT ALSO DICTATE WHAT TYPE OF AUDIO YOU CHOOSE TO DO WHETHER IT'S UP SHOTGUN OR LAPEL
hFHolYcaJew_20 0 SO THERE'S MANY FACTORS THAT COME INTO CHOOSING GOOD OUTDOOR LOCATION
hFHolYcaJew_21 0 LIKE I SAID THIS ONE IS IDEAL FOR ME BECAUSE IT'S IN A QUITE NEIGHBORHOOD A I'VE GOT THE SHADE OF THIS UMBRELLA IF I NEED IT AND I CAN POP THAT OVER AND KINDA RIGHT HERE WITH THE NICE BACKGROUND
hFHolYcaJew_22 0 SO THIS IS A GOOD LOCATION OF FOR WHAT I WANT BUT IT MAY BE DIFFERENT FOR YOU

H9z4FIxNLyM_1 0 HI I'M AMELIA AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'LL BE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THE LAWS OF HAIR COLOR
H9z4FIxNLyM_2 0 THIS IS A POCKET COLOR WHEEL THAT YOU CAN GET AT ANY ART SUPPLY STORE
H9z4FIxNLyM_3 0 OR IF YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHAT I'M DOING WITH IT
H9z4FIxNLyM_4 0 WELL ACTUALLY THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT
H9z4FIxNLyM_5 0 BECAUSE WITHOUT THIS YOU REALLY CAN'T COUNTERACT THE DIFFERENT COLORS THAT ARE GOING ON IN YOUR HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_6 0 SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
H9z4FIxNLyM_7 0 EVERY LEVEL THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED AN UNDERTONE IN YOUR HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_8 0 IN OTHER WORDS THAT EVERY LEVEL IF I WAS TO PUT BLEACH STRAIGHT ON THAT HAIR AND LIFT IT TO YOUR LEVEL WHAT WOULD BE THE COLOR THAT WOULD BE REMAINING IN THE HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_9 0 SO IF I TOOK THE THE OUTSIDE COLOR OFF WHAT WOULD BE THE INSIDE COLOR IN A MANNER SPEAKING
H9z4FIxNLyM_10 0 WELL AT A LEVEL SIX THE INSIDE COLOR WOULD BE ORANGE
H9z4FIxNLyM_11 0 AND LET'S BE HONEST NOBODY REALLY WANTS ORANGE HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_12 0 SO WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU HAD ORANGE HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_13 0 WELL YOU WOULD PUT BLUE COLOR ON IT
H9z4FIxNLyM_14 0 AND WHAT WITH THAT DO
H9z4FIxNLyM_15 0 THAT WOULD MAKE IT A NICE NEUTRAL BROWN
H9z4FIxNLyM_16 0 SO THESE ARE THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN PERFORMING COLOR ON YOURSELF AT HOME
H9z4FIxNLyM_17 0 I'VE SEEN A LOT OF WOMEN COME INTO THE SALON AND THEY GOT THE DARK ROOTS AND THEY GOT THE REALLY BRASSY END
H9z4FIxNLyM_18 0 WHAT I MEAN BY BRASSY IS THAT NICE ORANGE COLOR THAT'S A LEVEL SIX
H9z4FIxNLyM_19 0 AND THE WANTING TO KNOW WHY IT'S LIKE THAT AND I'M HAVING TO EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT WHAT HAPPENED IS IS WHEN THEY PUT THE COLOR ON THEIR HAIR FIVE WEEKS AGO PROBABLY DIDN'T USE A GOOD PRODUCTS OR A GOOD SHAMPOO AND THE COLOR IT'S FADED OFF
H9z4FIxNLyM_20 0 AND WHAT'S LEFT IS THE UNDERTONE
H9z4FIxNLyM_21 0 WHAT'S LEFT IS THE UNDERLYING COLOR
H9z4FIxNLyM_22 0 WHAT'S LEFT IS WHAT'S SHOWING WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE HAIR WITH UNDERNEATH THE COLOR
H9z4FIxNLyM_23 0 SO WHEN I HAVE TO APPLY A CORRECTIVE BASE I CHOOSE A COLOR THAT HAS A BLUE BASE
H9z4FIxNLyM_24 0 SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS RANGE I WOULD CHOOSE SOMETHING MORE IN THIS WELL THAT'S RED VIOLET IN THIS ASH BLUE OVER HERE
H9z4FIxNLyM_25 0 SO I WOULD HAVE TO APPLY LIKE A LEVEL SIX A B AND THAT WOULD COUNTERACT IN MAKE HER A NICE NEUTRAL SIX IN
H9z4FIxNLyM_26 0 SO WHENEVER YOU'RE APPLYING COLOR AND YOU'RE WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE BRASSY THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PULL WARM YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION YOUR LEVEL THE LIGHTNESS AND DARKNESS IN YOUR HAIR AND THE TONE OF YOUR HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_27 0 SO IF YOUR WARM IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF RED IN YOUR HAIR FOR GRANDMOTHER WAS A RED HEAD YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO PUT RED ON YOUR HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_28 0 YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO CHOOSE MAYBE AN ASH BASE
H9z4FIxNLyM_29 0 AND THAT ASH BASE WILL THEN COUNTERACTS THAT WE WANT IN YOUR HAIR AND MAKE A NICE NEUTRAL COLOR
H9z4FIxNLyM_30 0 SO WHENEVER CHOOSING A COLOR ALWAYS TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE UNDERLYING TONES IN YOUR HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_31 0 ARE YOU WARM OR ARE YOU COOL
H9z4FIxNLyM_32 0 AND IF YOUR WARM AND YOU WANT TO STAY WARM YOU APPLY A WARM COLOR
H9z4FIxNLyM_33 0 IF YOUR WARM AND YOU WANT TO BE NEUTRAL OR COOL YOU APPLY A COOL COLOR
H9z4FIxNLyM_34 0 SO WHENEVER YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE COLOR WHEEL OR WITH EVERYTHING ABOUT COLOR REMEMBER THE COLOR WHEEL
H9z4FIxNLyM_35 0 WHATEVER COLOR IS ACROSS FROM THE COLOR YOU WANT TO BE THAT'S THE COLOR THAT'S GOING TO NEUTRALIZE IT
H9z4FIxNLyM_36 0 SO THIS YELLOW ORANGE BLUE VIOLET IS GOING TO NEUTRALIZE THAT AND MAKE A NICE BROWN BASE
H9z4FIxNLyM_37 0 SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO PICK ONE OF THESE UP IF WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING A LOT OF HOME COLOR
G6LG4wlD8gs_1 0 HELLO WELCOME MY NAME IS JULIO NUTT
G6LG4wlD8gs_2 0 I'M A MASTER INSTRUCTOR AT THE JIM MCLEAN GOLF SCHOOL IN MIAMI FLORIDA
G6LG4wlD8gs_3 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO FIX YOUR GOLF SWING
G6LG4wlD8gs_4 0 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE BEST WAY TOWARD THE SWING IS TRUE DRILLS THROUGH PRACTICING THE D FOR EMOTIONS AND THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SWING
G6LG4wlD8gs_5 0 MANY AMATEUR JUST WANT TO JUMP IN AND THEY WANT TO GRAB THE FIVE IRON AND THEY WANT TO HAVE FULL SHOTS WAS A FIVE IRON THEM
G6LG4wlD8gs_6 0 THEY EXPECT THE SWING TO CHANGE WHILE THEY ARE HITTING FULL SWING
G6LG4wlD8gs_7 0 IT'S A LOT EASIER TO WRAP OUR WEDGE A NINE IRON AND JUST MAKE HAVE SWING
G6LG4wlD8gs_8 0 HALF CONNECTED SWINGS IF YOU'RE WORKING SOMETHING YOU'RE TAKE AWAY FOR WORKING SOMETHING YOUR RELEASE
G6LG4wlD8gs_9 0 OR JUST TAKE A CLUB IF YOU'RE WORKING SOMETHING THAT THE TOP OF YOUR SWING AND JUST PRACTICE THE POSITION
G6LG4wlD8gs_10 0 IF YOU'RE WORKING MAYBE IN AN OPEN CLUB FACE YOU HAVE YOU HAVE YOUR LEFT RACE TWO TO BEND AT THE TOP
G6LG4wlD8gs_11 0 GO THERE AND FEEL THE CORRECT POSITION
G6LG4wlD8gs_12 0 MANY TIMES YOU CAN ALSO CLOSE YOUR EYES AND JUST GET TO THE CORRECT POSITION AND YOU FEEL THE RIGHT POSITION
G6LG4wlD8gs_13 0 FEEL YOUR BODY PARTS WITH WHERE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE AND WAS REPETITION YOUR MUSCLE MEMORY IS GOING TO REPEAT THE MARRO AND IS GOING TO HELP YOU MAKE A VERY GOLF SWING
gC1kAU1Jsoc_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS HIU ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHOW HOW TO COOK GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE
gC1kAU1Jsoc_2 0 THE FIRST RECIPE I'M GOING TO SHOW IS HOW TO MAKE GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE FROM SCRATCH
gC1kAU1Jsoc_3 0 THEN WE WOULD TURN UP THE HEAT ON THESE STILL HAVE A POT OF WATER AND LET IT BOIL
gC1kAU1Jsoc_4 0 THEN WE WILL PUT A PINCH OF SALT SO THAT IT WILL KEEP THE GREEN COLOR OFF THE GREEN BEANS AND MOVE DROP OF GREEN BEANS IN THE HOLE OR A AND THAT IT BOIL FULL OUR ARMS FULL TO FIVE MINUTES
gC1kAU1Jsoc_5 0 YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THE GREEN BEAN WINDOWS FOR ONE SLICE MAYONNAISE
gC1kAU1Jsoc_6 0 ONCE THAT BEING BE NICE VARIETY YOU JUST HAVE TO DRINK THE GREEN BEANS IN TO US TRAINERS
gC1kAU1Jsoc_7 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUN THEM NECESSARY EATING RUNNING WATER
h0w8WiVr6UY_1 0 THE OTHER IS ESSENTIAL TOOLS FOR A BEAD MAKING IS A KILN
h0w8WiVr6UY_2 0 AND AS MENTIONED IN EARLIER SEGMENTS THE COUNTER FORMS TO FUNCTIONS
h0w8WiVr6UY_3 0 IT ALLOWS THE BEAD TO COOL OFF VERY GENTLY SO AS TO AVOID THERMAL SHOCK WHICH WILL CAUSE CRACKING AND A BEAD
h0w8WiVr6UY_4 0 AND IT ALSO IMPORTANTLY PERFORMS THE FUNCTION OF A KNEELING THE BEAD ANNEALING AS THE PROCESS OF MAKING HAPPY GLASS MOLECULES
h0w8WiVr6UY_5 0 WHERE THE GLASS MOLECULES GET TO VIBRATE
h0w8WiVr6UY_6 0 ANNEALING DOESN'T CHANGE THE LOOK OF THE BEAT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE SHAPE OF THE BEAD
h0w8WiVr6UY_7 0 BUT IT GETS THAT TEMPERATURE HIGH ENOUGH AND IN THE CASE OF THE THAT FAT TRAY ITALIAN THAT'S WE'RE USING NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT GETS THE GLASS HOT ENOUGH SO THAT THE MOLECULES IN THE BEAD FORM GET TO VIBRATE AND KIND OF MOVE A LITTLE BIT
h0w8WiVr6UY_8 0 SO THEY CAN WORK OUT ANY STRESS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE
h0w8WiVr6UY_9 0 WHEN WE MAKE A BEAD WHERE INTRODUCING LOTS OF FOCUS TEA INTO ONE PARTICULAR IS DOWN AND OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE THAT NOT BE SO LOCALIZED
h0w8WiVr6UY_10 0 BUT TO HAVE THE HEAT DISTRIBUTED EVENLY AND THERE ARE HOMOGENIZATION PROCESSES WE USE IN MAKING THE BEADS
h0w8WiVr6UY_11 0 WHAT WE DO A NICE KIND OF MARSHMALLOW TESTING OF THE BEAD AFTER WE'VE WORKED ON ONE DOT AREA OR WHEN DESIGNING AREA
h0w8WiVr6UY_12 0 THAT A LOT OF THIS TO BECOME CLEAR AS WE GO THROUGH THE SEQUENCES OF THE ACTUAL BEAD MAKING STEPS
h0w8WiVr6UY_13 0 BUT IN ANY OF THAT THE KNEELING KILN IT'S A FOR THEIR HOMOGENIZING INFLUENCE ON THE GLASS AND HELPS ENSURE THAT THE GLASS BEAD THAT YOU MAKE ONCE IT COMES DOWN TO ROOM TEMPERATURE WILL NOT CRACK
h0w8WiVr6UY_14 0 THERE ARE A SPECIAL KILNS MADE FOR THIS AND THEY ARE BEAD KILNS
h0w8WiVr6UY_15 0 A CERAMIC KILN AND THEORETICALLY B IS FOR MAKING GLASS BEADS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE SUPER CAREFUL NOT TO INTRODUCE THE GLUTE THE METAL ROD THAT YOU MAKE THE BEAD ON INTO ANY OF THE ELECTRIC ELEMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE COUNT
h0w8WiVr6UY_16 0 BECAUSE IF YOU DO YOU STAND THE RISK OF ELECTRIC HEATING YOURSELF
h0w8WiVr6UY_17 0 SO A DECAL WILL TYPICALLY HAVE A TOP CHAMBER WHERE THE ELECTRODES ARE THEIR WRAPPING YOU NEVER WHAT TYPES THAT WITH METAL DIRECTLY EXPOSED
h0w8WiVr6UY_18 0 BUT THERE'S AN UNDER NOT UNDERNEATH CHAMBER WHICH HAS USUALLY A MATCH SEPARATION WHERE YOU PHYSICALLY CANNOT INTRODUCE YOUR METAL MANDREL WHICH IS HOLDING YOUR BEAD TO AN ELECTRODE BY ACCIDENT
h0w8WiVr6UY_19 0 ADD TIME WHAT GETS ANOTHER PICTURE OF THE BEAD COUNT LATER ON YOU CAN SEE THE DOOR
h0w8WiVr6UY_20 0 BUT A BEAT TONE IS A GREAT TOOL ON THEY COST ANYWHERE FROM BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED DEGREES
h0w8WiVr6UY_21 0 SOME OF THEM HAVE CONTROL OF DOLLARS EXCUSE ME SOME OF THEM HAVE CONTROLLERS WHICH AUTOMATICALLY ADJUST THE TEMPERATURE AND OTHER IS TO SIMPLY USE A VARIABLE SPEED SORT OF POTENTIALLY ON THAT ARE DIAL AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING AT THE PIE RAW MITER WHICH TELLS YOU WHAT TEMPERATURE YOU'RE AT
h0w8WiVr6UY_22 0 ON THE KILN I'M USING IT'S NOT FANCY WE HAVE NO PROGRAMMABLE COMPUTER THAT DOESN'T KEEP IT AT A CERTAIN TEMPERATURE
h0w8WiVr6UY_23 0 I'M ALWAYS HAVING TO LOOK AT THE PIE RAMAT OR TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM MAINTAINING THE TEMPERATURE I WANT
h0w8WiVr6UY_24 0 IN THIS CASE RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT MY PIE RAMAT OR IN ITS INDICATING HARD TO SEE OF COURSE BUT TAKE MY WORD FOR THAT'S ABOUT NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE SEVENTY FIVE FAHRENHEIT
h0w8WiVr6UY_25 0 EIGHT THOUSAND IT STRAIGHT UP ON THAT MIDDLE SLASH
h0w8WiVr6UY_26 0 SO THAT'S THE PIE RAW MATTER AND THIS IS MY BEAD KILN AND AGAIN THESE ARE AVAILABLE FOR MANY OF THE GLASS SUPPLY HOUSES
h0w8WiVr6UY_27 0 WITH RESPECT TO THAT TELLS FUNCTION OF ANNEALING AND KEEPING THERMAL SHOCK AWAY THE PARTICULAR TO BE DETAIL I HAVE IN THIS INSTANCE ALSO SAVES A VERY VALUABLE SAFETY FUNCTION
h0w8WiVr6UY_28 0 BECAUSE THE BEAD WHEN IT GOES INTO THE KILN IT DOES NOT RISK GETTING INTO CONTACT WITH ELECTRODES THAT ARE LOCATED ABOUT BECAUSE THERE'S A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE UPPER CHAMBER AND THE BOTTOM CHAMBER
h0w8WiVr6UY_29 0 YOU'LL NOTICE THERE'S A MATCH SCREEN SO YOU WOULD NEVER PUT THAT OUT STEEL MANDRILL INTO THIS TOP AREA BECAUSE IT CAN ELECTROCUTE YOU
h0w8WiVr6UY_30 0 BY TOUCHING THE MANDREL TO THE ELECTRODES YOU CAN GET A INJURING OR KILLING STOCK
h0w8WiVr6UY_31 0 SO AT THE TAIL IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT AGAINST THIS AND HAS A SEPARATION SCREEN BETWEEN THE BEADS CHAMBER AND WHERE THE ELECTRODES ARE ACTUALLY LOCATED
GmSipqvuo3A_2 0 MY NAME IS NANCY ADLER AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY I'M GOING TO DO TO TEACH YOU TELL YOU HOW TO OPERATE A CINEMA A MOVIE CINEMA
GmSipqvuo3A_3 0 WE ARE IN THE CONCESSIONS STAND

GmSipqvuo3A_6 0 WE HAVE A SMALL BAG AND IT FOR THREE DOAN'S AND OUR LARGE THAT FOR FIVE DOGS AND WE ALSO HAVE SWEATSHIRTS THAT TO PEOPLE CAN'T BY FOR
GmSipqvuo3A_7 0 THEY MAKE GREAT SOUVENIRS OR CHRISTMAS GIFTS
GmSipqvuo3A_8 0 THEY SAY THAT TINKER STREET CINEMA ON THEM AND AROUND THE TWENTY ELSE SO WHAT THIS PLACES THAT
GmSipqvuo3A_9 0 THEY'RE CONCESSION STAND IS USUALLY VERY BUSY ON A ESPECIALLY ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND THAT
GmSipqvuo3A_10 0 WE'RE GOING TO ALSO TO THE TICKET COOL SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL YOU DON'T DROP INTO THE CASHIER WHILE YOU SEWING THE POPCORN
GrpCfdjXucE_2 0 I'M MICHAEL SETO
GrpCfdjXucE_3 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK MORE ABOUT MANAGING THE REFLECTIONS ON YOUR PIECE OF JEWELRY
GrpCfdjXucE_4 0 IN THE EARLIER CLIP WE TALKED ABOUT MANAGING THE REFLECTION FROM YOUR LIGHTS
GrpCfdjXucE_5 0 THE BEST WAY OF DOING THAT IS DIFFUSING THEM EITHER A LIKE TEN OR AS YOU SEE HERE WE PUT SOME DIFFUSION MATERIAL ON TOP OF OUR LIGHT SO THEY'RE NOT AS BRIGHT THEY'RE A LITTLE MORE EVEN
GrpCfdjXucE_6 0 THE NEXT THING YOU WANT TO BE CONCERNED WITH AND THEN LOOK AT IS ONE OF THE SURROUNDINGS OR BEING REFLECTED
GrpCfdjXucE_7 0 I CAN SEE PARTS OF THE ROOM HERE IN THE GLASS AS WELL AS ON THE THE STAINLESS STEEL OF THIS PARTICULAR WATCH
GrpCfdjXucE_8 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS BUILD OUR OWN LITTLE ENCLOSURE AROUND THIS TO MANAGE THE REFLECTIONS
GrpCfdjXucE_9 0 JUST TAKEN A CLAMP PUT IT ON A PIECE OF WHITE BOARD
GrpCfdjXucE_10 0 A PUT THAT THERE TO MANAGE THE REFLECTIONS COMING OFF IN THE ROOM
GrpCfdjXucE_11 0 I'M NOT GOING TO USE THE GOLD REFLECTIVE BECAUSE THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE APPROPRIATE FOR US STEAM THE STEEL OR WHITE COLD
GrpCfdjXucE_12 0 I GOT SOME OTHER REFLECTORS HERE AGAIN SILVER ON ONE SIDE WHITE ON THE OTHER
GrpCfdjXucE_13 0 REALLY IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TRIAL AND ERROR HERE
GrpCfdjXucE_14 0 THE SILVER IS GOING TO BRING OUT THE COLOR OF THE METAL A LITTLE MORE INTENSELY
GrpCfdjXucE_15 0 IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE DEEPER IN DARKER
GrpCfdjXucE_16 0 IF YOU USE THE WHITE SIDE THE METAL IS GOING TO LOOK A LITTLE MORE GRAY AND A LITTLE MORE TO FUSE AS WELL
GrpCfdjXucE_17 0 SO IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF LOOK YOU'RE GOING FOR
GrpCfdjXucE_18 0 AFTER YOU'VE MAN IS ALL THE OTHER REFLECTIONS AND DIFFUSER LIGHTS LAST THING YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS HOW DO YOU MEAN IS THE REFLECTION OF YOU AND THE CAMERA
GrpCfdjXucE_19 0 THAT OFTEN IS ONE OF THE MOST REVEALING OF REFLECTIONS WITHIN THE PIECE OF REFLECTIVE JEWELRY
GrpCfdjXucE_20 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TO MANAGE ARE OVER FLEXION AND OUT OF THE CAMERA IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
GrpCfdjXucE_21 0 VERY SIMPLE A PIECE OF PAPER WITH THE WHOLE CUT INTO IT
GrpCfdjXucE_22 0 WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS JUST HOLD THAT OVER THE CAMERA WHEN YOU'RE SHOOTING AND YOU BEHIND THAT IT'S REALLY ONLY GOING TO SHOW THE THE FRONT OF THE LENS AND MINIMIZE ANY BLACK SPOTS ON THE REFLECTION
GrpCfdjXucE_23 0 SO AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE MANAGING THE REFLECTION ON YOUR JEWELRY YOU'RE GOING TO THINK ABOUT THE LIGHTS YOU CAN THINK ABOUT SURROUNDINGS AND YOU TO THINK ABOUT MANAGING THE REFLECTION OF YOURSELF AND THE CAN
gEOHN9Y1QCo_1 0 THE LAST THING I WANT TO TRY AND DO IS I STILL WANT TO CREATE SOME MORE SEPARATION AND THAT ONE DARK AREA BEHIND THE NECK IS A LITTLE FRUSTRATING TO BE
gEOHN9Y1QCo_2 0 SO I HAVE SET UP ANOTHER LAYUP ANOTHER HOUSEHOLD LAMP BACK BEHIND THIS THING
gEOHN9Y1QCo_3 0 LET'S TURN IT ON AND SEE WHAT WE GET
gEOHN9Y1QCo_4 0 NOW WHAT HAS THAT DONE FOR US
gEOHN9Y1QCo_5 0 HAS THAT ACCOMPLISHED WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO
gEOHN9Y1QCo_6 0 IT'S CERTAINLY CREATING MORE SEPARATION
gEOHN9Y1QCo_7 0 WE'VE GOT A GOOD BRIGHT LIGHT BEHIND IT
gEOHN9Y1QCo_8 0 IT'S OF WARMER LIGHT THAT PARTICULAR LIGHT BACK THERE ISN'T CONTESTANT COMPARED TO THE FLUORESCENT IT'S DOWN IN THIS CORNER
gEOHN9Y1QCo_9 0 SO WE'VE GOT SOME COLOR SHIFTS GOING ON THAT IS PRETTY INTERESTING
gEOHN9Y1QCo_10 0 IT'S BEHIND THEIR
gEOHN9Y1QCo_11 0 IT'S SOFTENED THAT THUMB NECK SHADOW AND I THINK I MIGHT WANT TO MOVE IT SO THAT IT GETS RID OF MORE OF THAT NECK SHADOW
gEOHN9Y1QCo_12 0 SO IF YOU EXCUSE ME A MOMENT I'M GOING TO DISAPPEAR TEMPORARILY
gEOHN9Y1QCo_13 0 IS THAT BECOME VISIBLE
gEOHN9Y1QCo_14 0 HOW IS THAT LOOKING FROM WHERE YOU'RE SEEING
gEOHN9Y1QCo_15 0 BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT WHAT YOUR SCENE
gEOHN9Y1QCo_16 0 THAT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD
gEOHN9Y1QCo_17 0 THAT LOOKS REAL GOOD
gEOHN9Y1QCo_18 0 I'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT LOW CAUSE I'M SEEING A HAIR OF THAT BULB THROUGH THERE BUT I THINK THAT WERE VERY CLOSE TO WHAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY START TAKING DUFF FIRST PHOTOGRAPH
gEOHN9Y1QCo_19 0 I MAY HAVE PUT THAT ANGLE TOO MUCH
gEOHN9Y1QCo_20 0 I DON'T WANT IT TO BE A SHARP SHAPE LIKE THAT BUT IT'S WORKING CLOSE IN IS JUST MOVING BACK AND FORTH
gEOHN9Y1QCo_21 0 SEEING WHAT WE HAVE MEASURING IT AGAINST WHAT WE'RE GETTING A WITH OUR ICE FROM THE PURSE ADDITION OF THE CAMERA UNTIL WE'RE SATISFIED WITH THE COMPOSITION IN THE WAY THAT IT'S LIFT AND THAT LOOKS VERY GOOD
gEOHN9Y1QCo_22 0 I THINK THE CLIENT MY BOARD IN THIS CASE WE'LL BE PRETTY IMPRESSED
gEOHN9Y1QCo_23 0 THEY WILL BE HAPPY
gEOHN9Y1QCo_24 0 EVERY PRODUCT IS DIFFERENT
gEOHN9Y1QCo_25 0 THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT SHAPES
gEOHN9Y1QCo_26 0 THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT APPROACHES BUT THE APPROACH TO TRYING TO LIGHT IS BASICALLY THE SAME
gEOHN9Y1QCo_27 0 LIKE THE OBJECT FIRST YOUR PRIMARY SURFACES DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE REFLECTIONS OR WHETHER YOU WANT TO CONCENTRATE ON THE OVERALL SHAPE
gEOHN9Y1QCo_28 0 LIGHT IT SO THAT EVERYTHING IS VISIBLE ON AND THEN COME BACK IN USE OTHER LIGHTS TO BE TO USE TO CREATE HIGHLIGHTS DRAMA DIFFUSION SO THAT YOU'RE NOT SEEING DISTRACTING REFLECTION BIRTH REFRACTOR WRIST REFLECTIONS OR WRIST FRACTIONS ON THE SURFACE OF THE INSTRUMENTS AND THEN COME UP WITH A LIGHTING SYSTEM THAT WORKS TO HELP SEPARATED FROM THE BACKGROUND AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET SOME PRETTY INTERESTING PRODUCT SHOTS
hImkZKnL3Zk_1 0 THE NEXT THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS SOME FUN VALENTINE'S THAT YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR KID
hImkZKnL3Zk_2 0 IT WILL BE SOME SUPERVISION BECAUSE WE WILL BE DOING SOME HEAT EMBOSSING BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY'LL ENJOY DOING WITH YOU HELPING THEM

hImkZKnL3Zk_6 0 SO THE FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO IS TAKE OUR TWELVE BY TWELVE PIECE OF PAPER AND GO AHEAD AND CUT IT FOR THESE THREE BY THREE CARDS
hImkZKnL3Zk_7 0 SO THE FIRST THING I'M GOING TO DO IS CUT AT SIX INCHES AND THEN GO AHEAD AND CUT I'M AT BREAK
hImkZKnL3Zk_8 0 WHAT'S NICE ABOUT USING A TWELVE BY TWELVE PIECE OF PAPER TO MAKE THESE CUTE LITTLE CARDS AS YOU CAN GET A CARDS THAT ONE PIECE OF PAPER

g7U59bTbBVs_3 0 WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF AN ANCHOR COVERED HUGE PILES OF STONE AND EARTH AMOUNT
g7U59bTbBVs_4 0 DEEP INSIDE IT OR TWO SLIT WORLD WAR ONE TRENCHES THE FACE ONE ANOTHER WHAT WE AFFECTIONATELY CALLED THE KILL BOX
g7U59bTbBVs_5 0 MOST OF THE GAME IS PLAYED HERE ARE PURE ELIMINATION AS WE'VE FINISHED BUILDING THIS FIELD IS GOING TO HAVE RED VEHICLES ANOTHER BUILDING DEBRIS SO IT LOOK LIKE A NUCLEAR WORE OCCUR HERE
g7U59bTbBVs_6 0 THIS SO FAR AS THE ROUGH IS PLAYING FIELD THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT COME TO HEAL THIRTEEN OF EVER SEEN AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE VERY PROUD OF IT

GD4d-f-mp9I_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS CRAIG MORRELL
GD4d-f-mp9I_2 0 I'M WITH LANDSCAPE RESTORATIONS IN MIAMI FLORIDA
GD4d-f-mp9I_3 0 WE'RE HERE AT PALM HAMMOCK ORCHID ESTATE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PLANTING AND FERTILIZING
GD4d-f-mp9I_4 0 THE TITLE OF THIS CLIP IS TO BUILD YOURSELF A DAMP
GD4d-f-mp9I_5 0 NOW NOT REFERRING TO THE HOOVER DAM OF THE GRAIN CRUELLY DAM AROUND YOUR PLANTS
GD4d-f-mp9I_6 0 AND THE IDEA ABOUT THIS IS TO KEEP THE WATER CENTERED ON THE PLANT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE WORKING ON A SLOPE LIKE THIS ONE
GD4d-f-mp9I_7 0 SO WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS RIGHT AFTER WE PLANTED OUR PLANT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OURSELVES A LITTLE EARTHEN DAM FEW INCHES DEEP SO THAT THE WATER THAT WE PUT IN HERE AT THE BASE OF THE PLANT STAYS HERE
GD4d-f-mp9I_8 0 AND IT WILL SOAK DOWN THROUGH THE ROOT BALL DEEP AND SLOW
GD4d-f-mp9I_9 0 THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY WITH PALMS FOR FREE
GD4d-f-mp9I_10 0 YOU CAN BUILD THE DAM THAT MIGHT BE FOR FIVE FEET ACROSS IN ABOUT A FOOT TALL THE WHOLE SMALL LAKE OF WATER
GD4d-f-mp9I_11 0 SO ONCE WE GET THIS BELT OUR WATER STAYS RIGHT WHERE WE WANT TO RIGHT HERE
GD4d-f-mp9I_12 0 SO ALL WE'RE GOING TO DO IS TAKE THE BACK FILL AND MAKE OURSELVES A LITTLE EARTHEN DAMP
GndDItpzJOo_1 0 HOW TO MASTER THE OVER TECHNIQUE
GndDItpzJOo_2 0 LIKE ANYTHING WE DO IN OUR PERSONAL LIVES OR OUR DOG LIVES ROUTINE AND REPETITION COMMITMENT AND DEDICATION WILL PREVAIL
GndDItpzJOo_3 0 AS I'VE MENTIONED IN EARLIER SEGMENTS THINK ABOUT YOUR WALK WITH YOUR DOG AS BEING AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICE AGILITY
GndDItpzJOo_4 0 HERE YOU HAVE SEEN IN OVER OBSTACLE SO ON YOUR NEXT WALK WITH YOUR DOG CONSIDER THINGS IN YOUR LOCAL PARK WHETHER IT'S A BENCH OR A FALLING TREE LIMB IS OR ANYTHING THAT OR ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN USE FOR AN OVER COMMAND
GndDItpzJOo_5 0 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE SAME HEIGHT VARYING HEIGHT WILL BE GOOD SO YOUR DOG TRULY NEVER KNOWS WHAT TO EXPECT WITH THE NEXT OVER COMMAND
GndDItpzJOo_6 0 SO TO SUMMARIZE ROUTINE AND REPETITION REPETITION COMMITMENT AND DEDICATION WILL ALL ATTACHMENT WE TEACH YOUR DOG THE OVER COMMAND
GndDItpzJOo_7 0 THERE FOR WHEN YOU GET TO COMPETITION ANY WITH FOR HEIGHT OF STICK WILL BE A LOT EASIER FOR YOUR DOG TO MASTER

HEQ9KoTGaM4_21 0 OR I CAN ARE ALTERED
G5JmKsIULig_1 0 OKAY JUST A COUPLE THINGS I THINK WILL BE AN IMPORTANT TO SHARE WITH YOU BEFORE WE GET STARTED
G5JmKsIULig_2 0 BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FULLY HEAD YOU KNOW WHAT THE EVERYTHING HAS BEEN COVER

G5JmKsIULig_6 0 IT'S ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE DOLLARS YOU CAN GET THIS AT ANY PLACE SNOW RIDES HAYDEL IN THE PLACES
G5JmKsIULig_7 0 THESE DISPOSABLE OBVIOUSLY SO EVERY TIME YOU USE THESE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU THROW THESE OUT
G5JmKsIULig_8 0 DON'T KEEP DATES
G5JmKsIULig_9 0 WE HAVE ALSO THE LATEX GLOVES RIGHT HERE
G5JmKsIULig_10 0 WHICH I PREFER THAT
G5JmKsIULig_11 0 SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO JUST THROW IT NOT EVERY TIME

HjvIFzsKO-M_1 0 I CALL THEM OR TO BREAK ARE YOUR MEDICAL SCIENTIST IS TYPICALLY A BIOLOGIST WHO IS STUDYING PROCESSES OF LIFE AND USUALLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND DISEASE OR CONDITION THAT COULD BE TRANSLATED INTO MEDICINE OR MEDICAL PRACTICE
HjvIFzsKO-M_2 0 SOMETIMES THERE'S DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF MEDICAL SCIENTISTS
HjvIFzsKO-M_3 0 I'M PERSONALLY PEOPLE CALL ME A PHYSICIAN SCIENTISTS BECAUSE I BECAME A MEDICAL DOCTOR PHYSICIAN FIRST AND THEN ALSO DOES SCIENTIFIC TRAINING
HjvIFzsKO-M_4 0 BUT THERE ARE ALSO PHD SCIENTISTS TO BECOME BIOLOGIST AND GET INTERESTED IN MEDICINE AND THEY DON'T BE PATIENT CARE ALL
HjvIFzsKO-M_5 0 IN FACT THERE ARE SOME VETERINARIAN'S OR EVEN A DENTIST TO GO IN AND DO MEDICAL CLIENTS AND THERE ARE AREAS
HjvIFzsKO-M_6 0 MOST OF THE MONEY THAT IT COMES TO MEDICAL SCIENTISTS TO DO THE WORK COMES FROM THE GOVERNMENT OR FOUNDATIONS
HjvIFzsKO-M_7 0 SO THE INSTITUTION THAT HIRES YOUR DOESN'T REALLY PAY YOU IN A WAY
HjvIFzsKO-M_8 0 YOU HAVE TO RAISE YOUR OWN SOUR
HjvIFzsKO-M_9 0 SO BIG PART OF WHAT WE DO IS RIDING GRAMS
HjvIFzsKO-M_10 0 WE HAVE COLLABORATORS ALL THE WORLD
HjvIFzsKO-M_11 0 SO WHILE WE'RE SLEEPING OTHER PEOPLE AND IN YOUR UPPER WORKING IN
HjvIFzsKO-M_12 0 SO TYPICALLY I'LL HAVE A NUMBER OF EMAILS IN THE MORNING

HjvIFzsKO-M_14 0 SO THERE ARE BETWEEN TWENTY THIRTY PEOPLE IN MY LAB
HjvIFzsKO-M_15 0 SO TYPICALLY I WOULD HAVE MEETINGS ALL THE WAY WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK
HjvIFzsKO-M_16 0 I'M I'M JUST MORE OF A CHEERLEADER TRYING TO HELP THEM DO THEIR WORK
HjvIFzsKO-M_17 0 SO I WOULD HAVE A MEETING WITH A SMALL GROUP OF TWO OR THREE PEOPLE HEAR THE TABLE GOING OVER DATA
HjvIFzsKO-M_18 0 THEN I MIGHT ME WITH AN ADMINISTRATOR OR BUDGETS AND THEN I MIGHT MEET WITH SOME TRAINEES ABOUT A COMMIT A AND THEN MORE DATA
HjvIFzsKO-M_19 0 TYPICALLY IT'S IT'S MEETINGS FROM BEING DURING THE DAY AND THEN I MIGHT DO A COUPLE OF HOURS ON THE COMPUTER ON HERE AND GO HOME
HjvIFzsKO-M_20 0 I TYPICALLY GET TO ABOUT SEVEN ASH HAVE DINNER MY FAMILY AND THEN I MIGHT WORK FROM NINES OVER IN THE MORNING ON MY LAPTOP FROM IN BETTER AND SO FOR SOMETHING
HjvIFzsKO-M_21 0 SO THERE'S A LOT OF TYPING RIDING COMMUNICATING WITH PEOPLE
HjvIFzsKO-M_22 0 WELL THERE'S DIFFERENT SORT OF THEN USE THAT YOU CAN DO THIS TYPE OF WORK
HjvIFzsKO-M_23 0 I WORK IN AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER UNIVERSITY A UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER SO MY JOB NOT ONLY INVOLVES RESEARCH BUT ALSO DO A LOT OF TEACHING
HjvIFzsKO-M_25 0 IT TEACHES SMALL GROUP SETTINGS
HjvIFzsKO-M_26 0 I MENTOR A LOT OF SCIENTISTS AND MY LAUGH WE'RE GETTING PHD IS WHO OR WHO ALREADY HAVE A PHD AND OR GETTING A POST DOCTORAL TRAINING AND THEN I ALSO SEE PATIENTS
HjvIFzsKO-M_27 0 I'LL GO TO A MORE PEDIATRICIANS AUTO CHORES HOSPITAL AND SEE PATIENTS WITH INFECTIOUS DISEASES WHICH IS SOMEWHAT RELATED TO MY RESEARCH BUT BASICALLY IT'S A ALMOST TO SEPARATE JOB
HjvIFzsKO-M_28 0 SO THAT'S WHAT LIFE IS LIKE AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER
HjvIFzsKO-M_29 0 YOU CAN ALSO DO THIS TYPE OF WE'RE GOING TO COMPANY FOR PROFIT COMPANY IN WHICH I WOULDN'T BE SEEING PATIENTS WE'RE TEACHING OR REALLY MENTORING
HjvIFzsKO-M_30 0 YOU'RE JUST THERE TO PUSH THE PROJECT THROUGH AS FAST AS YOU CAN DO AND THAT CAN HAVE IT'S ATTRACTIONS TOO
HjvIFzsKO-M_31 0 IT'S SIMPLE OR AND MORE DEFINED AND IN A LITTLE LESS CRAZY
HjvIFzsKO-M_32 0 BUT I LIKE THE BROAD OR MISSION OF RESEARCH EDUCATION AND A PATIENT HERE

gZD8seYvhXA_4 0 THIS IS A PATCH THAT I PURCHASED AT A FABRIC STORE
gZD8seYvhXA_5 0 SOMETIMES YOUR CRAFT STORES AND AND SUPER DISCOUNT STORES WILL HAVE THEM AS WELL
gZD8seYvhXA_6 0 IT'S A HUNDRED PERCENT COTTON BUT IT DOES HAVE A SPECIAL BACKING ON IT FOR IT TO IT HERE
gZD8seYvhXA_7 0 IT'S REAL SIMPLE TO USE
gZD8seYvhXA_8 0 YOU CAN ACTUALLY CUT IT TO FORM
gZD8seYvhXA_9 0 IF YOU LIKE TO YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE THE WHOLE THING
gZD8seYvhXA_10 0 YOU CAN ACTUALLY CUT PATTERNS MAYBE OUT OF A COOKIE CUTTER IF YOU WANTED STARS OR DIFFERENT SHAPES
gZD8seYvhXA_11 0 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT FOR THIS TO STICK YOU NEED TO HAVE A REALLY WARM SURFACE
gZD8seYvhXA_12 0 I'M USING A PIECE OF COTTON FABRIC HERE AND I'M GOING TO LAY MY IRON DOWN AND GIVE IT ABOUT WHEN TWENTY OR THIRTY SECONDS TO IT'S WARM IN MY HAND AND I DON'T WANT TO PLACE MY HAND ON ANYMORE
GsKgVqt0Big_1 0 SO THAT STOP LOOKS LIKE THIS WITH THE ROD TIP
GsKgVqt0Big_2 0 YOU NOTICE THAT THE ROD IS LOADED UP
GsKgVqt0Big_3 0 I'M DOING MY POWER SNAP AND THEN MAKE THAT ABRUPT STOP
GsKgVqt0Big_4 0 IN THE STOP SEXY WHAT'S THROWING THE LIME OFF THE ROD TIP
GsKgVqt0Big_5 0 IF I DO IT AND I DON'T REALLY STOP I'M NOT REALLY PUT NEARLY AS MUCH POWER
GsKgVqt0Big_6 0 I'M DOING MY POWER SNAP MOUND PAUSE AND EVERYTHING BUT IT'S REALLY THE STOP THAT THROWS THE LINE OFF THE ROD TIP
GsKgVqt0Big_7 0 AND THEN YOU JUST WANT TO PAUSE LONG ENOUGH FOR THAT LINED UP ALMOST COMPLETELY STRAIGHT NOW AND YOU START ALL OVER AGAIN

GpMoGDW3OPU_3 0 IMPORTANT NOW JUST HAS THIS THE LITTLE ICON OF A WOMAN'S FACE TO REPRESENT PORTRAITS
GpMoGDW3OPU_4 0 AND WHEN YOU'RE IN THIS MODE UP THE CAMERA IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY HELP TO COMPENSATE WITH A APERTURE
GpMoGDW3OPU_5 0 IT WILL TRY TO GIVE YOU THE LARGEST APERTURE SETTING IN ORDER TO MAKE THE BACKGROUND BLUR OUT A LOT AND WILL HELP TO MAKE YOUR YOUR SUBJECT OR YOUR YOUR PORTRAIT INDIVIDUAL STAND OUT FOR THE BACKGROUND
GpMoGDW3OPU_6 0 WHEN YOU'RE TAKING PORTRAITS IT'S IT'S REALLY GOOD IDEA TO MAKE THE BACKGROUND AS FAR AWAY FROM THE SUBJECT AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM STICK OUT FROM THE BACKGROUND
GpMoGDW3OPU_7 0 BUT AT THIS MODE WILL HELP TO SOFTEN THE SKIN TONES ON YOUR SUBJECT
GpMoGDW3OPU_8 0 AND IF YOU HAVE A TELEPHOTO LENS THAT WILL ALSO HELP TO BLOW THE BACKGROUND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

hGOhN59c5HU_11 0 AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH RACKING WE RECOMMEND PRACTICING WITH WATER AS I'M DOING RIGHT NOW AS YOU GET CLOSE TO THE END OF YOUR RACKING OPERATION YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GENTLY TILT YOUR BUCKET AND KEEP THE HEAD OF THE RACKING CANE JUST UNDERNEATH THE BEER LEVEL SO THAT YOU CAN PULL UP ALL
hGOhN59c5HU_12 0 CAN WILL NOT TAKING IT SLUDGE AFTER YOU'RE DONE RACKING PUT YOUR SANITIZED AIR LOCK THAT STOPPER BACK ONTO YOUR CARBOY
hGOhN59c5HU_13 0 WELL IT MAY BE TEMPTING TO START SIPHONING WITH YOUR OWN MOUTH DO NOT DO THIS AS YOUR MOUTH IS FULL PLENTY OF MICROBES WHICH WILL CONTAMINATE YOUR
GP26EIR1bas_1 0 NOW ONE NEAT LITTLE TRICK THAT I ATE PAY YOU SOMETIMES ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M PRINTING WITH A FIBER BASED PAPERS ARE THE TIMES IN WHICH I DEVELOPED MY PRINT PAT
GP26EIR1bas_2 0 NOW THERE ARE DIFFERENT TIMES FOR OUR C PAPER AND FOR FIBER PAPER
GP26EIR1bas_3 0 THAT'S ONE WAS ONE WAY THAT THE FIBER BASED PAPERS A LITTLE BIT SLOWER TO WORK WITH
GP26EIR1bas_4 0 BUT I SORT OF LIKE IT BECAUSE I CAN DEVELOP MY FIBER BASED PAPER ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO FIVE MINUTES
GP26EIR1bas_5 0 AND THEREFORE I CAN SORT OF MANIPULATE THE WAY THAT PRINT LOOKS
GP26EIR1bas_6 0 I CAN MANIPULATE IT MUCH EASIER THAN I CAN MANIPULATE RC PRINT
GP26EIR1bas_7 0 ANOTHER THING THAT I CAN DO WITH THE FIBER BASED PAPERS I CAN USE TO DEVELOPERS
GP26EIR1bas_8 0 I CAN USE A DECK TALL AND SELECT TALL
GP26EIR1bas_9 0 THE DECK CAUSE A VERY COLD CONTRASTY DEVELOPER AND SELECT CALLS A VERY WARM DEVELOPER
GP26EIR1bas_10 0 SO IN A WAY I'M GETTING THE BEST OF BOTH WORLD'S USING THOSE TWO DIFFERENT DEVELOPERS
GP26EIR1bas_11 0 NOW IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE TO USE TWO DIFFERENT DEVELOPERS BUT SOMETIMES PRICE IS DEFINITELY WORTH WHAT YOUR FINAL OUTCOME OF YOUR PRACTICE
gOWTeucGAts_1 0 NOW YOU MIGHT BE STAYING CHEESE I ONLY NO SEVEN SCRATCH IS AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO SOUND GOOD AT FIRST BUT THE WAY YOU GET GOOD AT IT IS BY WOULD SHEDDING THE SCRATCHES
gOWTeucGAts_2 0 NOW WHAT WOULD SHEDDING IS IS YOU JUST TAKE ONE SCRATCH OR ONE COMBINATION OF SCRATCHES AND ALL AND PRACTICE JUST THAT SCRATCH FOR A NUMBER OF MINUTES OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
gOWTeucGAts_3 0 SO IF YOU SEE A DRUMMER WEARING A RUDIMENT OR DRUM ROLL THE DRUMMER MIGHT GO IN PRACTICE A DRUM ROLL FOR FIVE SOLID MINUTES JUST SAID DRUM ROLL
gOWTeucGAts_4 0 SO YOU HAVE TO DO THE SAME THING HERE
gOWTeucGAts_5 0 YOU HAVE TO TAKE ONE SCRATCH AND WE'LL CAKE WILL TAKE THE CHIRP SCRATCH AGAIN
gOWTeucGAts_6 0 AND IF YOU DON'T SOUND HIGH VERY GOOD AT FIRST BUT ONCE IT CLICKS ONCE YOU GET IT OUT ALL MAN I DID ONE RIGHT THEN YOU GOT TO GO BACK AND DO IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN HA HA HA HA HA VERY VERY SLOWLY
gOWTeucGAts_7 0 I JUST PRACTICE THAT ONE SCRATCH AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU MIGHT WANT TO EVEN PRACTICE ONE PARTICULAR SCRATCH FOR THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF YOUR BRAKE RECORD
gOWTeucGAts_8 0 THEN YOU'LL KNOW YOU'RE GETTING GOOD AT IT VERY FAST
h9L80BtdN2A_1 0 HI I'M BILL WITH ZOAR OUTDOOR ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE DOT COM WE'RE HERE TODAY AT CHAPEL LEDGES IN ASHFIELD MASSACHUSETTS AND IN THIS SERIES I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE BASICS OF MOVING ON ROCK
h9L80BtdN2A_2 0 STEMMING IS A TECHNIQUE THAT USES THE OFF POSITION OF FORCES ACROSS THE CORNER TO MAKE USE OF HANDED FOOTHOLDS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE NOT HELP YOU
h9L80BtdN2A_3 0 SO BY PLACING MY FEET ACROSS THE CORNER AND USING MY HANDS TO STABILIZE ME I CAN STAND COMFORTABLY AND THEN MOVE UP BY OPPOSING MY LEFT FOOT WITH MY RIGHT HAND
h9L80BtdN2A_4 0 SO I CAN RELEASE MY RIGHT FOOT OPPOSING MY RIGHT FOOT WITH MY LEFT HAND SO I CAN MOVE MY LEFT FOOT IN UP I GO
h9L80BtdN2A_5 0 AGAIN YOU WANT TO AVOID STANDING UP TO STRAIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR STEMMING BECAUSE YOU WON'T HAVE ANY OPPOSITION AND YOU'LL SLIP
h9L80BtdN2A_6 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE KEEPING YOUR HANDS LOW ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN PUSH NOT REACHING TOO HIGH BECAUSE THAT WILL AGAIN ELIMINATE YOUR OPPOSITION FORCES BECAUSE YOU TO SLIP
h9L80BtdN2A_7 0 ONCE YOU'VE GOT IT RIGHT IT'S REAL STABLE YOU MIGHT EVEN GET NO HANDS REST FOR AWHILE
gSg8EX84TYU_1 0 HOW DO YOU STRENGTHEN TEAS FLAVOR
gSg8EX84TYU_2 0 I'M GOING TO USE BLACK TEA BECAUSE SO MANY OF YOU OUT THERE DRINK GLASSY
gSg8EX84TYU_3 0 SO A SIMPLE THIS IS ABOUT TEN TWELVE OUNCES OF TEA AND I LIKE MY TEA STRONG BUT I'VE NEVER HAD TO FOR EXAMPLE
gSg8EX84TYU_4 0 SO I CAN USE A GOOD AMOUNT FOR MY EIGHT TO TEN OUNCES BUT I WANT TO TRY IT STRONGER
gSg8EX84TYU_5 0 I'M WITH BLACK TEA YOU SHOULD NOT LET IT GO FOR TOO LONG SO NICE TEA BAGS BECAUSE WITH THE BAG YOU CAN LET IT SIT FOR AN HOUR TO OUR SO THE WHOLE DAY AND YOU'LL GET A STRONG CUP BUT BASICALLY WITH IS THE SAME
gSg8EX84TYU_6 0 THE LOOSE LEAF TEA IS VERY DIFFERENT
gSg8EX84TYU_7 0 YOU'LL NOTICE RIGHT AWAY WHEN I PUT IN THE BOILING WATER THAT THE COLOR WILL CHANGE IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME
gSg8EX84TYU_8 0 IF YOU NOTICE THE COLOR DIFFERENCE RIGHT AWAY THIS IS THE LIGHTER BROWN IS A DARKER BROWN INSTANTLY
gSg8EX84TYU_9 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT THREE TO FIVE MINUTES TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE AND THIS ONE'S A LOT STRONGER THAN THIS ONE
gSg8EX84TYU_10 0 AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME A QUICK BREW WITH A LOT OF TEA LEAVES IS THE WAY TO GO
gSg8EX84TYU_11 0 SO IN ORDER FOR YOU TO MAKE STRONG TEA I DON'T RECOMMEND LEAVING IT FOR TOO LONG
gSg8EX84TYU_12 0 I ALWAYS RECOMMEND ADDING MORE TEA LEAVES AND USING IT OVER AND OVER FOR MORE TEA
gSg8EX84TYU_13 0 TO MAKE STRONGER HERBAL TEA YOU'RE WELCOME TO LEAVE IT FOR A LONG TIME BUT FOR GREEN TEA AND LONG AND USING MORE TEA LEAVES IS THE BEST WAY TO GO AND INCREASING THE TEMPER JUST A LITTLE BIT BUT BE THAT THE OF THE OTHER ALTERNATOR

gxcxxP7Q0Fg_1 0 HI I'M TIM GIPSON AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HANG A PICTURE
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_2 0 NOW THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO LOOK AT WHEN YOU'RE HANGING YOUR PICTURES YOU WANT TO LOOK ON THE BACKSIDE AND SEE WHAT TYPE OF ATTACH POINT IT HAS
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_3 0 NOW THIS PARTICULAR PICTURE THAT I'M GOING TO HANG RIGHT NOW AS YOU CAN SEE IT HAS THIS CLASP AT THE TOP THAT WILL HANG ON A HOOK OR A NAIL OR SCREW
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_4 0 AS A ON THE BACK OF THIS PICTURE YOU'LL SEE THIS ON HEAVIER PICTURES ARE HEAVIER MIRRORS YOU ACTUALLY SEE THE THIS WIRE THAT IS STRONG FROM EACH SIDE
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_5 0 AND SO THIS IS DESIGNED TO HANG ON A ON A HOOK THAT GOES INTO THE WALL
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_6 0 NOW IF WE HAVE A WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DETERMINE IS WE GOT TO DETERMINE ARE HANG POINT SO WE WANT TO DETERMINE HOW HIGH WE WANT THIS ON THE WALL
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_7 0 IT WILL HOLD IT UP IT WILL SAY WELL WE WANT RIGHT THERE OKAY
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_8 0 NOW WE CAN HOLD THIS UP WITH ONE POINT
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_9 0 SOMETIMES WE GOT TO GET OUR SHOULDERS AND HANDS INVOLVED
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_10 0 AND THEN WANT TO TAKE OUR PENCIL AND WE CAN MARK THE TOP OF THE PICTURE
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_11 0 NOW WE'VE MARKED THE TOP OF THE PICTURE BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHERE WE WANT TO PUT THE HANGER
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_12 0 AND THERE'S SEVERAL HANGERS THAT WE CAN USE THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT THIS POINT
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_13 0 SO WHERE WE HAVE THIS CLIP NOW IN THE WALL RIGHT HERE WE'VE ALREADY GOT PRETTY INSTALLED THEY'RE JUST HAPPEN TO BE A STUD RIGHT HERE WHERE THIS PICTURE IS GOING
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_14 0 SO IN THAT CASE YOU CAN JUST NAIL IN A BROADHEAD NAIL OR JUST A STANDARD COMMON NAIL AND THAT'LL HOLD THAT
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_15 0 IF FOR A YOU HAVE THE WIRE THEN YOU'LL WANT TO USE A HOOK LIKE THIS THAT JUST GOES INTO THE NAIL
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_16 0 IF YOU HAVE HEAVIER DEVICES YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A SCREW IN ANCHOR SUCH AS THIS OR JUST A STANDARD ANCHOR WHERE YOUR DRILL A HOLE AND THEN YOU WOULD USE A SCREW AS YOUR ATTACH POINT
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_17 0 SO REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW HEAVY YOUR ITEM IN
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_18 0 SO WHAT WE'RE HANGING THIS WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO MEASURE DOWN FROM THE TOP
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_19 0 IN THIS CASE IT'S THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH SO WE WOULD COME FROM THE LINE WHERE WE WANT IT WE'RE MEASURE THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH DOWN AND THAT'S WHERE WE WERE DRIVE ARE NAIL
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_20 0 SO ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE NAIL IN THERE IT'S JUST SIMPLY LOCATING IT AND MAKING SURE IT HANGS LEVEL
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_21 0 NOW IT'S A GOOD IDEA WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS TO HAVE A TORPEDO LEVEL WHICH IS A SHORT LITTLE LEVEL THAT YOU CAN PUT ON TOP TO HELP YOU MAKE SURE YOU HANG THIS LEVEL
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_22 0 AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_23 0 I'M TIM GIPSON AND THAT'S HOW TO HANG A PICTURE
gBgxA_jCk0A_1 0 HI THIS IS JOSIAH OWEN WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAKING A COOKIE TREE
gBgxA_jCk0A_2 0 ALRIGHT NOW THIS IS MELTED COMPLETELY WE HAVE OUR WAX PAPER READY
gBgxA_jCk0A_3 0 WE CAN GO AHEAD AND POUR THIS ON HERE I'LL SET THIS TO THE SIDE WHICH WILL KIND OF FLATTEN THIS OUT SO WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO TAKE THIS AND FOLD IT OVER THAT WAY YOU CAN MANIPULATE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH PUSH THIS TO THE SIDE AND WATCH OUT INTO A BIT WARM YOU WOULD NOTICE IF I'M LOOKING AT IT BUT IT IS
gBgxA_jCk0A_4 0 SO WE WANT TO SPREAD THIS OUT
gBgxA_jCk0A_5 0 WHAT ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH TO A HALF AN INCH THICK QUITE IN BETWEEN THERE
gBgxA_jCk0A_6 0 TO FLATTEN THIS OUT EVEN WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS GOING TO GO AHEAD AND THROW THIS IN THE OVEN TO NOW THE OTHER IN THE REFRIGERATOR
gBgxA_jCk0A_7 0 AND PULL IT OFF YOU CAN SEE IT'S THE ONE PIECE SO GO AHEAD AND THIS BACK OVER AND LET IT SIT THOSE COOL PART ABOUT FIVE TO TEN MINUTES
GiguArk30IQ_1 0 LIGHT HAS PROBABLY BE AN AROUND AS LONG AS WE HAVE PICKED UP SOMETHING AND SCRATCH THE MARK WITH IT
GiguArk30IQ_2 0 SO IT'S THE FIRST THINGS THAT WE DO WHEN WE START TO DRAW ALL WE'VE DRAWN OUTLINED YOU KNOW YOU DRAW THE MOM WITH THE ROUND LINE AND SO ON SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DRAWING WE ALMOST ALWAYS KIND OF THINK OF LINE
GiguArk30IQ_3 0 BUT THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT LINE IS USED
GiguArk30IQ_4 0 THIS IS A PICASSO PAINTING AND THIS IS USING THE LINE AS A CONTOUR TO SHOW YOU YOU KNOW WHAT THE SHAPE OF THE BODY AND SO THIS IS A CONTOUR LINE
GiguArk30IQ_5 0 AND HE'S DEPENDING ON THAT BECAUSE REALLY WITHOUT THE LINE THIS WOULD JUST BE A LOVELY GROUP OF YOU KNOW COLORS SORT OF SMUSH TOGETHER
GiguArk30IQ_6 0 IT'S THE LINE THAT SORT OF HELPS TO GIVE THIS A NATURAL SUBJECT
GiguArk30IQ_7 0 COMPARED TO THAT WE'VE GOT THIS USE OF LINE WHERE IT IS ACTUALLY JUST USING A WHITE LINE ON BLACK INSTEAD OF BLACK ON WHITE AND THIS IS A VERY SORT OF FREE WHAT WE WOULD CALL IT A SORT OF CALLIGRAPHIC LINE VERY CURVY AND VERY FREE
GiguArk30IQ_8 0 IT'S A LOT ABOUT THE GESTURE OF THE FOOD YOU'RE ALL SET
GiguArk30IQ_9 0 IT'S VERY SIMPLE THIS DRAWING IS JUST IS ABOUT LINE AND IT'S ABOUT BLACK AND WHITE THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT
GiguArk30IQ_10 0 YOU EVEN HAVE WHEN YOU'RE ELEMENTS SOMETIMES
GiguArk30IQ_11 0 THIS IS A SCULPT A SERIES OF SCULPTURES AND IT'S PLAYING WITH THE IDEA OF LINE REACTING WITH THE SPACE SO IT'S NOT A DRAWING OF LINE ON A PIECE OF PAPER BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A DRAWING REALLY WITH WITH STEEL IN SPACE
GiguArk30IQ_12 0 SO YOU KNOW LIKE THIS THAT LINE IT'S NOT JUST THE MARK YOU MAKE WITH A PENCIL
GiguArk30IQ_13 0 THEY MADE THIS PICTURE USING THE EDGE OF THE RIBBON AS A LINE AND THEN REPEAT IT THE LINE TO CREATE THE SHAPE
GiguArk30IQ_14 0 SO THAT'S NOT REALLY AN OUTLINE BUT IT IS A VERY IF THIS IS BASICALLY A DESIGN BASED ON USING LINE
GiguArk30IQ_15 0 LINE UP ALSO AND I HOPE YOU CAN SEE THIS CAN BE USED TO CROSS HATCH AND CREATE MOVEMENT SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND FORM INSTEAD OF USING VALUE TO UNDERSTAND FORM
GiguArk30IQ_16 0 THE MOVEMENT OF THE LINE KIND OF CREATES THE FORMS SO THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL THE PETALS ON THE FOLDING IN THIS RENDITION OF ROWS
gVKwgUxyCIo_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS BARRY PAYNE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gVKwgUxyCIo_2 0 YOU CAN USE TESTING ON STUDDING AS A MIRROR TO REFLECT BACK THE OTHER ONTO SPLITS IN A DIFFERENT LOOK
gVKwgUxyCIo_3 0 ONCE YOU
gVKwgUxyCIo_4 0 YOU CAN SAY THAT NOW SKEW USE CERTAIN THAT YOU USE THE NO MATTER WHAT WAS JUST THE MOST OF IT

gVKwgUxyCIo_12 0 YOU CAN SUMMARIZE THE INDULGE WILL ASPECTS OF THE OLD HUMANS THAT FULL SO SOMMERSBY QUITE USE
gVKwgUxyCIo_13 0 THERE'S ONE REASON ABOUT EVERY OUT OF THAT TESTING UNCLE SPENDING IS USE THE NEGOTIATION MOST BETWEEN FIRST OF ALL OF THEM
gVKwgUxyCIo_14 0 THE IDEA WHAT HAPPENED THERE SO THAT SHOULD CENTER OR OPEN MY STATIONS RATHER WILL STOP THEM OFF BY ANY WILL APPLY TO THE EQUIPMENT OFFS EQUIPMENT WE'RE GOING TO LAST SECTION
gVKwgUxyCIo_15 0 CIRCLES MIGHT BE ABLE TO VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT
gVKwgUxyCIo_16 0 THEN YOU THAT WILL MIGHT HAVE A FEW PROBLEMS GETTING THE CROTCH WE'RE READY TO POINT
gVKwgUxyCIo_17 0 A MAJOR WAS IN MOUNTAIN

gVKwgUxyCIo_26 0 WELL I FEEL WE DON'T
gVKwgUxyCIo_27 0 A MINOR POINT LIKE ABOUT MAJOR NEGOTIATIONS
gVKwgUxyCIo_28 0 I SAID THE RESEARCH PAPER IS BACK TO THE SHAFT DUE TO A RECEPTIONIST DOING I WAS
gVKwgUxyCIo_29 0 I'M GOING TO WANT TO SHOVE IT WAS NOT ONE OF THE SUCCESSFUL RUBLE ONE OF THE AVERAGE
gVKwgUxyCIo_30 0 BECAUSE WE DID MEDICATION LOST OR VERSION
gVKwgUxyCIo_31 0 SHE SAID SUCCESSFUL
gVKwgUxyCIo_32 0 SO IT WILL COME UP SOMEONE DID
gVKwgUxyCIo_33 0 WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK TO MORE WITH JUST AS WE AGE

g9HmSWzBJ1Y_1 0 HI I'M FOUNTAIN MORE BLAST OUT COLUMN AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO ANSWER SOME FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE A VIDEO RESIN
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_2 0 SO HOW SHOW JUST MY VIDEO RESUME
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_3 0 APPEARANCE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR VIDEO RESUME
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_4 0 NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ONLY REALLY ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE CAN BENEFIT
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_5 0 IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT PROFESSIONAL PRESENCE IS REQUIRED
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_6 0 MAKE SURE IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE JOB ENSURE THAT YOUR PURSUING
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_7 0 IF POSSIBLE USING RESEARCH AND THE INDUSTRY STANDARD PRACTICE IS A VERY PROFESSIONAL ON THIS HERE IS A SUIT ENTIRE ACQUIRED
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_8 0 REMEMBER THE DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND EVEN DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION IS HAVE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF PROFESSIONAL ATTIRE
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_9 0 ON THE EAST COAST FOR EXAMPLE STANCE PROFESSIONALS ARE VERY FORMAL RARELY RECEIPT ANYONE GO INTO A CALL WITHOUT A SUIT TIE AND JACKET EVEN IN THE SUMMER
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_10 0 ON THE CONJURE ON THE WEST COAST MANY SALES PROFESSIONALS WHERE TIRE THAT MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLES A PROFESSIONAL GOLFER RATHER THAN A SALES REP KHAKIS AND POLISH ARTS ARE OFTEN CONSIDERED DRESSED UP
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_11 0 ALWAYS ERR ON THE SIDE OF TWO PROFESSIONAL IF YOU'RE IN CERTAIN
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_12 0 NO ONE WILL DISCOUNT YOU FOR LOOKING TO NICE
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_13 0 IF YOU CREATE A VIDEO RESUME AND JEANS AND TEE SHIRT YOU'RE PROBABLY HURTING YOURSELF
gBEv-iksiNo_1 0 NOW LET'S INSERT THE MATCHES INTO THE PAPER TOWEL ROLLS
gBEv-iksiNo_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO INSERT THE MATCHES WITH THE WOODEN PARTS OF THE MATCH THE STICK PART INSIDE ALL THE WAY UNTIL THE THE TIP OF THE MATCH IS JUST STICKING OUT AND CAN'T GO IN ANY MORE
gBEv-iksiNo_3 0 YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE INSIDE THAT ONCE THE MATCH STICKS ARE ARE THERE THERE CREATING THAT TYPE OF THE OBSTACLE FOR WHEN THE RICE FLOWS DOWN IT'S GOING TO BE HITTING THOSE MATCH STICKS AND MAKE IT GO DOWN MUCH SLOWER AND THAT'S GOING TO CREATE THE SOUND OF THE RAIN
gBEv-iksiNo_4 0 SO THE REASON WHY WE'RE PUTTING THE STICKS IN WITH THE THE WOODEN SIDE IN FIRST IS ONE BECAUSE THE THE TIPS OF THE MATCHES GIVE A DECORATION TO THE STICK AND THE OTHER REASON IS BECAUSE THE TIP OF THE MATCH ALSO HELPS THE STICK FROM KNOCK GOING THROUGH ALL THE WAY TO THE END
gBEv-iksiNo_5 0 KIND OF GIVES US A STOP WHERE IT IS ABLE TO JUST STICK UP UP FROM THE PAPER TOWEL ROLL AND NOT BE GET LOST INSIDE INSIDE THE ROLL
gBEv-iksiNo_6 0 SO THOSE ARE THE REASONS WHY WE'RE PUTTING THE WOODEN PART IN FIRST
gBEv-iksiNo_7 0 NOW IF YOU WANTED TO YOU COULD USE COLORED MATCH STICKS MATCHES RATHER WHERE THE THE HEAD OF THE MATCH IS A DIFFERENT COLOR AND YOU CAN ALTERNATE THOSE COLORS
gBEv-iksiNo_8 0 WE'RE USING ONE COLOR WHICH IS RED WHICH IS USUALLY COMMONLY FOUND AMONG WOULD MATCH STICKS BUT THEY DO HAVE DIFFERENT COLORS AND IF YOU CAN OBTAIN THEN YOU CAN YOU CAN REALLY MAKE A NICE DECORATION ON YOUR STICK USING THE ALTERNATING THE COLORS AND MAKE YOUR DIFFERENT DESIGN WITH THEM
gBEv-iksiNo_9 0 BUT NOW WE CAN SEE THE SINCE WE MADE THE HOLES ALONG THE SEAM LINE WE CAN SEE NOW WHILE I WAS IMPORTANT TO MATCH UP THE ROLLS ALONG THE SEAM LINE BECAUSE THE WE WANT TO HAVE A CONTINUATION OF THE MATCH STICKS GOING FROM THE TOP TO BOTTOM
gBEv-iksiNo_10 0 SO THAT'S WHY WE MATCHED UP SO IT LOOKS VERY SYMMETRICAL
gBEv-iksiNo_11 0 THE LONGER THE ROLE IS THE MORE MATCHES YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PUT IN AND THEN THEY'LL BE MORE OBSTACLES FOR THE RICE GOING DOWN
gBEv-iksiNo_12 0 AND AGAIN THOSE OBSTACLES THE RICE HITTING THE MATCH STICKS IS WHAT'S CREATING THE NOISE SO IT'LL GIVE IT MORE OF AN EFFECTIVE YOU WHEN YOU'RE USING THE LONGER ROLL AND ARE ABLE TO INSERT MORE MATCH STICKS
gBEv-iksiNo_13 0 SO WE PUT THE MATCH STICKS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE END
gBEv-iksiNo_14 0 FOR THIS PROJECT WE USE ABOUT A BOX AND A HALF MATCH STICKS
gBEv-iksiNo_15 0 AND IT'S GOOD TO HAVE AT LEAST TO MATCH THAT MATCH BOXES ON HAND
gBEv-iksiNo_17 0 JUST IN CASE YOUR ROLLS OUR LITTLE LONGER THAN THE ONES WE'VE USED
gBEv-iksiNo_18 0 AND WE SEE THIS IS HOW THE STICK LOOKS ONCE THE MATCH STICKS ARE PLACED INSIDE ALONG THE SEAM LINE AND WE SEE THAT THIS SPACED EVENLY
gBEv-iksiNo_19 0 THEY GO ALONG THE SEAM FROM TOP TO BOTTOM SO IT HAS A NICE EVEN SYMMETRICAL LOOK TO IT
gBEv-iksiNo_20 0 AND NOW I'VE SHOWN YOU HOW TO PLACE THE MATCH STICKS INSIDE THE ROLLS
HgZReSHdveQ_1 0 LET'S TALK NOW ABOUT HOW TO STORE YOUR HOOKS ON YOUR TIP UP WHEN EITHER YOUR HOME OR YOU'RE ON THE ICE IN YOUR TIP UP IS NOT AN USE
HgZReSHdveQ_2 0 YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE LINE DANGLING
HgZReSHdveQ_3 0 EVERYTHING IS GOING TO GET TANGLED
HgZReSHdveQ_4 0 ALL YOUR TEMPO SO BE TANGLE TOGETHER WITH ALL YOUR OTHER EQUIPMENT
HgZReSHdveQ_5 0 THE OTHER THING YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS ACTUALLY PUT YOUR HOOK INTO YOUR LINE TO HOLD IT BECAUSE ALL YOU'RE DOING IS CREATING A WEAK SPOT ON YOUR LINE
HgZReSHdveQ_6 0 I'M I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE AND OFTENTIMES ALMOST COMPLETELY WENT THROUGH MY ICE FISHING LINE
HgZReSHdveQ_7 0 IT'S HARD TO GET THE HOOK OUT AND AGAIN IT CREATES A WEAK SPOT WHERE IF YOU DO GET A BIG FISH THAT'S GOING TO BE THE SPOT WHERE YOUR LINE BRAKES
HgZReSHdveQ_8 0 AS AN ALTERNATIVE YOU CAN SIMPLY PUT THE HOOK INTO THE WOODEN END OF THE OF THE TIP UP
HgZReSHdveQ_9 0 NOW THAT'S A GOOD PLACE TO HOLD THE BUT WHAT THAT WILL DO OVER TIME IS DULL YOUR HOOK AND YOU ALWAYS WANT YOUR HOOKS A SHARP AS POSSIBLE TO INCREASE YOUR HOOK UP RIGHTS
HgZReSHdveQ_10 0 THERE'S A COUPLE OTHER METHODS
HgZReSHdveQ_11 0 YOU CAN PURCHASE STRAPS LIKE THIS THROUGH SOME SPECIALTY COMPANIES
HgZReSHdveQ_12 0 THE HOOK SIMPLY GOES IN THE VELCRO YOU WIND IT AWAY FROM YOU IN THERE
HgZReSHdveQ_13 0 YOUR HOOKS CONTAINED
HgZReSHdveQ_14 0 IT'S NOT EXPOSE SO IT'S NOT GOING TO CATCH AND ANYTHING
HgZReSHdveQ_15 0 YOUR LINE ISN'T GOING TO COME OUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET TANGLES
HgZReSHdveQ_16 0 NOW A A CHEAPER AND EASIER METHOD IS SIMPLY TO USE A RUBBER BAND

GUQo3MA2MyE_25 0 ALL THE FLUSH AND BOSER ON THERE BUT YOU KNOW THIS GUY'S LOOKING A LITTLE BLANK
GUQo3MA2MyE_26 0 SO LET'S START DRAWING THE DETAILS NOW
GUQo3MA2MyE_27 0 AND THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER NEEDS DETAILS ARE THEY SHOULD FOLLOW THE CONTOUR OF THE BODY
GUQo3MA2MyE_28 0 THAT'S ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO DO BECAUSE THIS IS NOT LIKE A FLAT OBJECT IN OUR HOW MUCH IT LOOKS AT THE LINES HAVE TO AND FLOW AND FOLLOW ALONG IN DIFFERENT AREAS
GUQo3MA2MyE_29 0 BECAUSE THIS IS YOU KNOW LIVING BREATHING COMIC CREATION HERE
GUQo3MA2MyE_30 0 THIS IS NOT A NOT A STATIC INDIVIDUAL
GUQo3MA2MyE_31 0 THIS IS OUR REAL BREATHING PERSON
GUQo3MA2MyE_32 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LINES ACCOUNT FOR THAT AS WE'RE DRAWING THINGS IN
GUQo3MA2MyE_33 0 ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS AND SPIDERMAN ONE OF THE MOST NERVE RACKING IS ALWAYS DRAWING IN THE EYES RIGHT
GUQo3MA2MyE_34 0 SPIDERMAN ALWAYS HAS THOSE CRAZY EYES AND IT'S SO EASY TO MESS UP ON
GUQo3MA2MyE_35 0 AND AS SOON AS YOU DO LIKE ELBOW I HEAR THAT'S IT

Hex1F22DDBE_23 0 WHEN YOU'RE BACKING UP YOU'RE TRYING TO CENTER THE BACK WHEELS OR YOUR TIRE RIGHT THERE IN THE GROOVE AND AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT YOU WORRY ABOUT THE FRONT TIRES
Hex1F22DDBE_24 0 IT'S REAL IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REAR END OF THE CAR IS WHERE YOU WANT IT AND NOT BE SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE FRONT END
Hex1F22DDBE_25 0 YOU CAN CORRECT REALLY QUICKLY THE FRONT OF THE CAR BUT IT TAKES TEN FEET PULLING FORWARD TO CORRECT MORE THAN FOUR INCHES WITH YOUR BACK TIRES

Hfz1T9VUUJY_11 0 SO THE TWELFTH FRET THIRTEENTH FRET IS A HALF STEP
Hfz1T9VUUJY_12 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO BEND OUR STRING UP SO THAT WHEN WE BEND THE NOTE IS SOUNDS LIKE THE THIRTEENTH FRET

hiIHTYpRh8Y_1 0 OKAY THE SIXTY DEGREE WEDGE IS REALLY LOFTED AND ONE THING I FORGOT TO MENTION PREVIOUS SEGMENTS MAYBE IS THAT IF YOU OPEN THE FACE YOUR CLUB IT DOES INCREASED THE LOFT OF WHICH MEANS IT PUTS THE BALL HIGHER
hiIHTYpRh8Y_2 0 BUT A SIXTY DEGREE CLUB IS PRETTY MUCH THE MOST LOFTED CLUB THAT MOST PEOPLE MOST PLAYERS WILL USE
hiIHTYpRh8Y_3 0 AND SO EVEN WHEN YOU'RE AT A NEUTRAL STANCE A NEUTRAL CLUB FACE OR EVEN A CLOSE CLUB FACE IT GIVES YOU THE MOST LOSS
hiIHTYpRh8Y_4 0 THAT GIVES YOU THE MOST OPTIONS IF YOU WANT TO GET A LOT OF LOFT ON THE BALL
hiIHTYpRh8Y_5 0 SO IT'S A GREAT WEAPON AND BECAUSE IT'S SO LOFTED THOUGH IT DOES TAKE A LOT OF PRACTICE TO GET IT TO WHERE YOU HAVE GOOD CONTROL WITH IT BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE COMING UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND YOU'RE LEARNING TO POP IT UP TO A GOOD TO THE RIGHT DISTANCE SO YOU GOT TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THE SIXTY DEGREE CLUB BUT IT'S A GREAT CLUB AND LET'S SEE HOW IT GOES HERE

gOLkajVzsEc_3 0 THE FIRST PART IN AN UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'RE GIRLFRIEND IS CHEATING ON YOU IS TO GET PROFESSIONAL HELP

gOLkajVzsEc_11 0 SO TO CLARIFY IF IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU GO TO A MARRIAGE COUNSELOR WHETHER YOU'RE MARRIED OR NOT TO HELP UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN A RELATIONSHIP
gOLkajVzsEc_12 0 MARRIAGE COUNCILORS WORK WITH RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PEOPLE OR MARRIED OR NOT

GIdjUXyFdz4_1 0 OKAY THE NEXT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS IS A STOP WATCH
GIdjUXyFdz4_2 0 NORMALLY THE THE TIME KEEPER AT RING SIDE IS GOING TO BE KEEPING TRACK OF THE THE TWO MINUTE ROUNDS IN THE MINUTE REST PUT IT IN BETWEEN IF YOU HAVE THE HEADS UP YOURSELF ON APPROXIMATELY WHEN TEN SECONDS IS LEFT IN THE AROUND YOU CAN TRY TO GET YOUR BOXER A LITTLE BIT MORE EXCITED AND A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT MORE ABLE TO FINISH THAT ROUND IN A GOOD POSITIVE WAY
GIdjUXyFdz4_3 0 SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU HAVE YOUR ASSISTANT YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO DO YOU HAVE YOUR ASSISTANT KEEP TRACK OF THE TIME AND WHEN HE REACHES A MINUTE AND FIT THE SECOND HE CAN SAY TEN SECONDS AND THEN YOU TELL YOUR BOXER TEN SECONDS JOE TEN SECONDS
GIdjUXyFdz4_4 0 OKAY THAT ALLOW THAT BOXER THOSE LAST TEN SECONDS
GIdjUXyFdz4_5 0 THAT'S THE LAST TEN SECONDS AT THE JUDGES ARE GOING TO SEE
GIdjUXyFdz4_6 0 THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT TEN SECONDS
GIdjUXyFdz4_7 0 IF THAT BOXER KNOW THERE'S ONLY TEN SECONDS LEFT YOU MIGHT GET THAT EXTRA LITTLE BIT OF WIND THAT HE NEEDED TO GO BACK OUT THERE AND THEN FINISH STRONG THAN A STRONG OKAY ALSO WHEN YOU'RE WORKING IN BETWEEN IN BETWEEN THE ROUNDS IN THE CORNER IF YOU'RE IF YOUR SYSTEM CORNER MAN ALSO HAS A STOP WATCH HE CAN ALERT YOU WHEN THERE'S APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SECONDS LEFT TO THE AROUND TO THE IN BETWEEN THE AROUND
GIdjUXyFdz4_8 0 THAT WAY BY THE TIME YOU HEAR THE WORD SECONDS OUT AND YOU ONLY HAVE TEN SECONDS LEFT YOU'VE ALREADY HAD A HEAD START YOU'VE ALREADY PUT YOUR MOUTHPIECE INTO THE BOXER YOU'VE ALREADY GOT HIM READY TO GO

GUGpTrCMn70_3 0 NOW A FEMALE IGUANA WILL OBVIOUSLY AND LAY EGGS WHETHER OR NOT A MALE IS AROUND
GUGpTrCMn70_4 0 EVEN IF THE EGGS ARE NOT FERTILE THEY WILL STILL LAY EGGS
GUGpTrCMn70_5 0 THE MAIN PROBLEM IN FEMALE IGUANAS WOULD BE THE EGG BOUND WORD WHICH IS WHERE THEY CAN'T LADY EGGS
GUGpTrCMn70_6 0 USUALLY CAUSED BY AN IN PROPER HOUSING PROBLEM
GUGpTrCMn70_7 0 NOW FEMALE IGUANAS NEED TO HAVE A GOOD AREA TO LAY EGGS IF THEY NEED TO UP
GUGpTrCMn70_8 0 MAYBE A CAT PAN SIZED AREA
GUGpTrCMn70_9 0 EVEN A CAT CAN WILL WORK GREAT IF YOU JUST FILL IT WITH SOME SOIL OR FOR MAKE YOU LIGHT
GUGpTrCMn70_10 0 THAN THIS WILL PROVIDE A WONDERFUL AREA FOR YOU WANT TO LAY EGGS AND DEFINITELY RELIEVE HER FROM THE STRESS OF BEING EGG BOUND
GUGpTrCMn70_11 0 THE WANT IS THAT FEMALE IGUANAS THAT ARE NOT KEPT WITH THE MALE DEFINITELY TEND TO BE MUCH MORE PRONE TO BEING A GROUND
GUGpTrCMn70_12 0 SOMETIMES MALE IGUANAS DO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR RELAXING PENISES
GUGpTrCMn70_13 0 THIS WILL APPEAR AS A LARGE PINK BLOB OF BASICALLY COMING OUT OF THE CLOAK WILL AREA UNDERNEATH THE WANNA
GUGpTrCMn70_14 0 AND THIS IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE TREATED BY A VETERINARIAN
GUGpTrCMn70_15 0 MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A VETERINARIAN LINED UP BECAUSE WHEN THIS DOES HAPPEN IT'S VERY DANGEROUS TO THE IGUANAS
GUGpTrCMn70_16 0 IF LEFT UNTREATED IT CAN CAUSE DEATH INFECTION VERY PAINFUL AND IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO TAKE TO THE VET IMMEDIATELY
Gu7TP21WqvM_1 0 TODAY WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT
Gu7TP21WqvM_2 0 THE HIGH HAT THE HIGH HAT CAN BE USED A LOT OF TIMES IT'S UNDERESTIMATED HOW MUCH IT CAN BE USED TO CHANGE THE FEEL OF THE SONG
Gu7TP21WqvM_3 0 THERE'S A LOT OF FOCUS ON PLAYING THE SNARE AND THE BASS DRUM INJUNCTION WITH EACH OTHER
Gu7TP21WqvM_4 0 BUT REALLY THE THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN BE DONE WITH THE HIGH HAT
Gu7TP21WqvM_5 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS LOOK AT A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS WE CAN DO WITH THE HIGH HAT FROM ACCENTING IT TO OPENING AND CLOSING IT TO PLAYING WITH BOTH HANDS ON IT
Gu7TP21WqvM_6 0 SO TO THE FOCUS OF THIS WILL BE ON THE HIGH HAT
Gu7TP21WqvM_7 0 WE'RE GOING TO KIND OF SET OURSELVES UP WITH THE BASE AND SNARE DRUM PATTERN AND REALLY SEE WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THAT HIGH HAT
Gu7TP21WqvM_8 0 IDEALLY YOU WANT TO HAVE A WORKING HI HAT STAND WITH A VERY DEGREE OF OPEN THIS TO REALLY LET YOU GET THE MOST OUT OF IT AND YOU ALSO WANT TO HAVE YOUR HIGH HAT POSITIONED IN A COMFORTABLE WAY
Gu7TP21WqvM_9 0 THE WAY I HAVE IT ON MY DRUM TO HAVE DOUBLE PEDAL HERE IS I HAVE IT OFF A LITTLE BIT TO MY LEFT
Gu7TP21WqvM_10 0 IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL TO ME BECAUSE I'M AN OPEN HAND THE DRUMMER I PLAY THIS WAY AND IT'S ALSO LOW ENOUGH FOR ME BECAUSE I PLAY OPEN HAND IT'S JUST ABOUT THE HEIGHT OF THE SNARE
Gu7TP21WqvM_11 0 SOMEONE WHO PLAYS CROSSING OVER WOULD BE LIKELY TO HAVE THE HIGH HAT HIGHER AND MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE FURTHER OVER TO THE LEFT
Gu7TP21WqvM_12 0 MAYBE YOU'RE WHERE MY RIDE CYMBAL IS

hi4TMDAaGw8_1 0 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR THE ADHD ADULTS
hi4TMDAaGw8_2 0 I'LL START BY A TALKING ABOUT PRESCRIPTION OPTIONS JUST BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST WELL KNOWN TO PEOPLE
hi4TMDAaGw8_3 0 IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR PEOPLE OF MY GENERATION TWO OF GROWN UP WITH A NUMBER OF CLASSMATES TO WEAR ON READ A LEMON
hi4TMDAaGw8_4 0 I HAPPEN TO COME FROM THE PART OF THE COUNTRY YOU THAT HAD THE MOST KIDS ON REDOLENT DURING THE EIGHTIES
hi4TMDAaGw8_5 0 AND IT WAS A SORT OF THING WHERE YOU CAN SEE FOR SOME KITS HOW IT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE
hi4TMDAaGw8_6 0 ESPECIALLY IF YOU SAW THEM BEFORE THEY EVER EVER TO THE MEDICATION
hi4TMDAaGw8_7 0 AND THESE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO ADULTS AS WELL
hi4TMDAaGw8_8 0 AS I MENTIONED READILY AND WHICH IS A GENERICALLY KNOWN AS MUFFLE FUN AND THEY CAN BE A PRIMER METHOD OF TREATMENT
hi4TMDAaGw8_9 0 A CONCERT I WOULD BE ANOTHER LINE ACTING FORM OF MUFFLE FUN AND DATE
hi4TMDAaGw8_10 0 AND IT'S A STIMULANT
hi4TMDAaGw8_11 0 IT CAUSES ACTIVITY TO INCREASING THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX WHICH INSTEAD OF BEING STIMULATING IN DISTRACTING FOR SOMEBODY WITH ADHD IS ACTUALLY A CALMING IN FOCUSING THING
hi4TMDAaGw8_12 0 AFTER ALL IS ANOTHER TREATMENT
hi4TMDAaGw8_13 0 AND THAT'S A COMBINATION OF AMPHETAMINE SALT
hi4TMDAaGw8_14 0 WE'RE ALL IS ALMOST MORE WELL KNOWN AS A DRUG OF ABUSE
hi4TMDAaGw8_15 0 WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE IT CAN BE PART OF AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR ADULT WITH ADHD
hi4TMDAaGw8_16 0 HE AND AGAIN IT'S ANOTHER STIMULANT WHICH INCREASES ACTIVITY IN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX
hi4TMDAaGw8_17 0 ADHD ADULTS MIGHT ALSO BENEFIT FROM CERTAIN ANTIDEPRESSANTS THAT CAUSE DIFFERENT ACTIVITY WITHIN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX IN TERMS OF A DOPA MEAN YOUR DOMAIN REACT TAKES
hi4TMDAaGw8_18 0 SO THERE'S MORE DURABLE MEAN THAT YOU'RE NARROW TRANSMITTER'S SOAKING IN
hi4TMDAaGw8_19 0 THE CARE OF IT IS A NON STIMULANT OR NONTRADITIONAL STIMULANT OPTION
hi4TMDAaGw8_20 0 AND THAT INVOLVES INHIBITING TO REACT TAKEN OR OUT FROM NOR APPAN AFFERENT WHICH IS TEND TO BE HELPFUL IN ADULTS WITH ADHD
hi4TMDAaGw8_21 0 IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR ADHD ADULT WHO HAS DEPRESSION ANXIETY ISSUES TO HAVE THOSE CORACLE MORBIDITY IS PROPERLY TREATED
hi4TMDAaGw8_22 0 SUBSTANCE ABUSE FALLS INTO THIS TOO
hi4TMDAaGw8_23 0 SO THAT'S WHY FOR SOME ADHD PATIENTS IS ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR DEPRESSION THEIR ANXIETY TO THEIR ANXIETY BE ANXIETY TO BE MANAGED
hi4TMDAaGw8_24 0 SO THEY CAN ELIMINATE THOSE FACTORS AS DISTRACTIONS IN TREATING THEIR ADHD
hi4TMDAaGw8_25 0 AND HAVE AN OVERALL BETTER FEELING ABOUT THEMSELVES IN THE LIFE THEY NEED
hgZiIrxQPvk_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'LL LOOK AT A TECHNIQUE THAT WE CAN USE TO STIMULATE THE INTESTINES IN THE MOVEMENT OF DIGESTION AND STIMULATING THE COLON

hgZiIrxQPvk_7 0 AND YOU'LL FEEL SOME PRESSURE
hgZiIrxQPvk_8 0 AND YOU'LL JUST WANT TO BREATHE INTO THE BLOCK AND TAKE YOUR TIME TO RELAX INTO THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY LAYING ON THE BLOCK
hgZiIrxQPvk_9 0 YOU CAN SEE I'VE GOT IT ON AN ANGLE
hgZiIrxQPvk_10 0 I CAN CONTROL THAT ANGLE AND MOVING MY WEIGHT FORWARD EVEN MORE FOR TWO ANGLES THE OTHER DIRECTION
hgZiIrxQPvk_11 0 AND ULTIMATELY JUST WANT TO LET THE HEAD RELAX IT AND LET THE BODY RELAX AH AT AND LET THE PRESSURE SO GOOD
hgZiIrxQPvk_12 0 THIS IS ALSO A GREAT WAY TO SOFTEN THE TISSUES OF THE ABDOMEN
hgZiIrxQPvk_13 0 THE WHOLE BLOOD ATTENTION ALL THE STUFF TISSUES OF THE ORGANS AND SO IF YOU HAVE HARDNESS OR STIFFNESS OR FEELING OF CONGEST GIN AND THIS PART OF THE BODY THIS HELPS TO JUST SOFTEN THAT AREA WHETHER YOU NEED HELP WITH DIGESTION OR LAMINATION YOU JUST NEED TO RELAX THERE

GF0eCUV3ACQ_4 0 THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT ONE STRAIGHT THROUGH IT NOW WHAT WE WANT TO DO THIS IS TRICKY BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO WANT TO COME OFF OF THE BAT GOING TO SLOWLY GATHER ALL THIS CLAY AND MEANWHILE PRESSING FIRMLY DOWN ON THE BAT IT LIKE THAT IT AND IT CAN HEAR ME BUSHING THROUGH THOSE AIR BUBBLES OR SO I'M BASICALLY MAKING LIKE A RAIN RIGHT NOW
GF0eCUV3ACQ_5 0 ALL THE WAY DOWN THE THAT ONE PINCHING PINCHING THROUGH THOSE AIR BUBBLES AND DRAGGING THIS UP A DRAG UP SLOWLY BECAUSE NOW THAT WE'RE AT FOUR WE HAVE THE HOLLOW THING HERE IS HAVE A TENDENCY OF FALLING OFF OF THE BAT THERE

h9n26LeM0X4_5 0 AND THE WASH THEM IN OUR COLD WATER NOW YOU WANT TO TRY THEM IN THE SAME SETTINGS AS YOUR WHITE CLOTHES
h9n26LeM0X4_6 0 THESE TWO LOADS REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY DIFFERENCE IS WHEN IT COMES TO DRY

h9n26LeM0X4_8 0 YOU ON HOW TO DRY ON LOW SHEET
h9n26LeM0X4_9 0 YOU CAN HAVE THEM VERY DRY OR REST DRY DEPENDING ON HOW TO LET THE ARE WHEN THEY'RE COMING OUT OF THE WASHER AND WE HAVE OUR TIME DRYING WITH HIGH HEAT AND THEN YOU CAN PUT AS MUCH TIME IN IT AS YOU WANT
h9n26LeM0X4_10 0 IF YOU HAVE A LARGER LOAD THE ONE THAT YOU HAVE UP TO AN HOUR TO HAVE YOUR CLOTHES IN
h9n26LeM0X4_11 0 THERE IF YOU HAVE A SMALLER LIVE BAIT TWENTIES TWENTY FIVE MINUTES DEPENDING ON HOW LONG IT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO GET DRY
h9n26LeM0X4_12 0 NOW WITH THE KELLY CLOSE AS OPPOSED TO WHITE CLOTHES YOUR ONE CONCERN IS FADING SO YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE YOUR CLOTHES IN THE DRYER FOR TOO LOW
h9n26LeM0X4_13 0 YOU TAKE AND ALL THAT CARE TO WASH IT IN COLOR OF WATER SO THAT THERE'S NOT BLEEDING
h9n26LeM0X4_14 0 YOU WANT YOU DON'T WANT TO GO AHEAD AND MAKING ALL THAT TENSION OF PUTTING IT INTO THE DRYER FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME WHICH IS GOING TO CAUSE YOUR CLOTHES DATE
h9n26LeM0X4_15 0 WHEN YOU'RE WASHING THEIR OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT ALREADY IS ENOUGH DAMAGE TO YOUR CLOTHES
h9n26LeM0X4_16 0 YOU WANT TO JUST TAKE THAT THAT TIME JUST TO LOOK AT WHICH THEY EASY THINGS ARE ARE GOOD FOR THE CLOTHES

h9n26LeM0X4_18 0 THIS IS NOT A RELEASE THE ENERGY THAT IT'S JUST GOING TO BE MORE DAMAGE TO YOUR COLOR CLOTHES
h9n26LeM0X4_19 0 SO THOSE ARE THE OPTIONS
h9n26LeM0X4_20 0 YOU CAN PUT IT ON A DRY OR YOU CAN PUT IT ON YOUR TIME DRY BUT THE CHOICES UP TO YOU
h8yFlNScCIQ_1 0 HI SO YOU HAVE A SCREAMING TOOTH ACHE
h8yFlNScCIQ_2 0 WELL I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ON HOW YOU CAN PREVENT AND TOOTH ACHE UNTIL YOU SEE YOUR GENERAL DENTIST
h8yFlNScCIQ_3 0 MY NAME IS MICHELLE AND I'M A DENTAL ASSISTANT WITH SOLUTIONS
h8yFlNScCIQ_4 0 AND MAINLY A COUPLE OF REASONS AS FAR AS HOW TO PREVENT TOOTH ACHE UNTIL YOU CAN SEE YOUR GENERAL DENTIST IS YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND PERCHES MAYBE SOME OVER THE COUNTER OR OLD NUMBING MEDICINE AND SUCH AS OR JOE
h8yFlNScCIQ_5 0 WELL WHAT THAT WILL DO IS YOU JUST PLACE THE GEL ON YOUR GUMS AND ON THE TOOTH AREA WHERE YOU'RE HAVING ACHE FROM
h8yFlNScCIQ_6 0 THAT WILL NUMB THAT IS THE AREA FOR A FEW MINUTES THEM ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE MINUTES AND THEN THEN YOU WOULD WANT TO KEEP REAPPLYING THROUGHOUT THE DAY
h8yFlNScCIQ_7 0 YOU ALSO MIGHT WANT TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE SOME OVER THE COUNTER MEDICATION AS FAR AS LIKE TIE A KNOT ADVIL IBUPROFEN
h8yFlNScCIQ_8 0 ADD COLOR IBUPROFEN IS BEST BECAUSE IT HAS AN ANTI INFLAMMATORY IN IT WILL WHICH WILL HELP WITH ANY INFLAMMATION THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE IN THAT AREA
h8yFlNScCIQ_9 0 BUT UNTIL YOU CAN SEE YOUR GENERAL DENTIST THOSE ARE THE THINGS YOU WANT TO DO BUT YOU DEFINITELY DO WANT TO GO SEE YOUR DENTIST AFTERWARDS SO THEREFORE HE WOULD BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF TO THINK YOU'RE HAVING IF IT'S A GUM PROBLEM OR IF IT'S AN ACTUAL TOOTH PROBLEM AND HE WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF IT FROM THERE
h8yFlNScCIQ_10 0 ONCE AGAIN MY NAME'S MICHELLE AND I JUST EXPLAINED TO YOU ON HOW TO PREVENT A TOOTH ACHE UNTIL YOU SEE YOUR GENERAL DENTIST
gPnoD1ZRhnE_1 0 SO THE NEXT OPTION IS ON FOR PAPERS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IN A SPECIFIC COLOR THAT YOU'RE FLIPPING FOR MAGAZINES CAN FIND ARE LOOKING AT A PAPER STORE AND CAN'T FIND IS TO PAINT THE PAPER YOURSELF
gPnoD1ZRhnE_2 0 THE BEST TYPES OF PAPER TO USE FOR THESE ARE THE THICKER STOCK PAPERS AGAIN BECAUSE YOU'RE WORKING WITH A WET SURFACE
gPnoD1ZRhnE_3 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A TYPE OF PAPER THAT WON'T ON BUCKLE WON'T FALL APART ON YOU ESPECIALLY THIN PAPERS I'M DRAWING PAPERS FROM A DRAWING PAD USUALLY OR A LITTLE TOO THIN FOR DOING THIS TYPE OF PAINTING ON
gPnoD1ZRhnE_4 0 SO AS YOU CAN SEE HERE I SORT OF HAVE CREATED OF ARRAY OF COLORS FOR MYSELF
gPnoD1ZRhnE_5 0 I'VE ALSO DONE ON THE OTHER PAINTINGS THAT I DECIDED THAT I WASN'T TO FOND OF AS A PAINTING AS A WHOLE ON PAPERS AND I'VE CUT OUT DIFFERENT PIECES ARE RIPPED OUT DIFFERENT PIECES AND SHAPES ON SO THAT I CAN USE PAPERS THAT I'VE PAINTED ON MYSELF
gPnoD1ZRhnE_6 0 SO AGAIN YOU HAVE ALL TYPES OF OPTIONS WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH PAINTING YOUR OWN PAPER
gPnoD1ZRhnE_7 0 BUT THEN YOU HAVE THE ODD CHOICE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE COLORS THAT YOU'D LIKE AND THE COLORS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
g5g75qxynPg_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT TO APPLYING WATER BASED STAYING IN TO A PIECE OF MATERIAL
g5g75qxynPg_2 0 IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I HAVE TO USE THE SAME BASIC TECHNIQUE AS I SHOWED WITH THE STAIN EARLIER THE THE OVERLAPPING CIRCLES
g5g75qxynPg_3 0 BUT AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY SEE WITH THIS PRODUCT IT DOESN'T HAVE A TENDENCY TO RAISE THE GRAIN AS MUCH AS THE OIL BASED STAIN AND THE NOW IN THIS CASE I DIDN'T CONDITION THE WOOD AT ALL
g5g75qxynPg_4 0 SO I'M JUST GOING STRAIGHT ON TO THE WOOD WITH THE STAIN
g5g75qxynPg_5 0 AND THE YOU COULD POSSIBLY SEE THAT THE THE COLOR STAYS PRETTY CONSISTENT
g5g75qxynPg_6 0 IT'S JUST THAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE LETTER WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO USE MORE
g5g75qxynPg_7 0 GO BACK TO YOUR BOTTLE OF OF STAIN MORE OFTEN TO KEEP IT WET BECAUSE IT WILL SOAK IN VERY READILY TO THE MATERIAL
g5g75qxynPg_8 0 BUT AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S A PRETTY EVEN COAT OF COLOR
g5g75qxynPg_9 0 AND GET A CLOSER LOOK AT THEM AND TO AS COMPARED TO THE END ON TREATED PIECE OF WOOD USING A AN OIL BASED STAIN
g5g75qxynPg_10 0 SO THIS IS PROBABLY A PRETTY GOOD CHOICE FOR YOU BEGINNERS

GcpnJMAZmXo_1 0 HI MY NAME IS RACHEL SORENSON AND THE EQUESTRIAN PROGRAM MANAGER HERE AT THE NATIONAL ABILITY CENTER
GcpnJMAZmXo_2 0 THIS SADDLE WE CALL OUR NEOPRENE SADDLE IT'S AN ADAPTIVE SADDLE THAT WE USE FOR WATER RIDERS TO NEED A LITTLE OF YOU WHO HAVE HAVE A LITTLE LESS MOBILITY MAYBE
GcpnJMAZmXo_3 0 SO RIDERS IN A WHEELCHAIR WHO HAS DRIBBLE PALSY WHO HAS THE MUSCLES IN THEIR LEGS
GcpnJMAZmXo_4 0 THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO START BECAUSE THEY CAN UTILIZE THE SUPPORT OF SIDE WALKERS EASIER AS WELL AS THEIR LEGS DON'T HAVE TO BE IN THE DOWN POSITION TO BE ABLE TO RIDE
GcpnJMAZmXo_5 0 THEIR LEGS CAN BE A LITTLE HIGHER UP BECAUSE THE LEGS ARE TARTAR
GcpnJMAZmXo_6 0 AND IT'S ALSO COMFORTABLE ON IT'S GOING TO HELP WITH ANY TYPE OF SKIN SKIN BREAK DOWN OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT'S MORE OF A COMFORTABLE SADDLE
GcpnJMAZmXo_7 0 IT ALSO ALLOWS THE RIDER TO FILL THE HORSE MORE BECAUSE IT'S CLOSER TO THE HORSE
GcpnJMAZmXo_8 0 THE HEAT OF THE HORSE CAN COME UP THROUGH THE SADDLE TO HELP RELAX MUSCLES THAT ARE TIGHT
GcpnJMAZmXo_9 0 THERE'S A HANDLE HERE TO HELP AGAIN FOR SAFETY THE RIDER CAN HOLD ON
GcpnJMAZmXo_10 0 THERE ARE STRIPS THAT CAN BE ATTACHED TO THIS OR THAT OR IT CAN BE WRITTEN WITHOUT STIRRUPS IN THIS GENERALLY FITS MOST OF THE HORSE'S BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE A SOLID TREE AND DIRTY
gyRlgBAT2Lc_1 0 NOW WE HAVE THEM DETERMINED BY THE BY HAVING TAKING MEASUREMENTS BEFORE THAT THE THAT THE DEPTH OF THE NUT SLOTS ARE ARE ARE GOOD BECAUSE THE THE STRINGS ARE SITTING IT AT A DECENT HEIGHT ABOVE THE FRETS
gyRlgBAT2Lc_2 0 AND WE HAVE NO BUZZES HERE ON THE FIRST FRET
gyRlgBAT2Lc_3 0 THAT MEASUREMENT JUST THROUGH YOUR OWN INTEREST THE IS THE BELT OF TWO HUNDRED SEVEN INCH ABOVE THIS FRET BOARD AND THAT NUMBER IS VARIABLE DEPENDING UPON THE HEIGHT OF THE FRETS THEMSELVES
gyRlgBAT2Lc_4 0 BUT IT WORKS ON THIS PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT IT'S A GOOD GOOD HEIGHT
gyRlgBAT2Lc_5 0 BUT WHAT WE'VE DETERMINED WAS THAT THE FRET THAT THE KNOT ITSELF WAS TOO HIGH BECAUSE THIS THE STRINGS ARE SITTING TO DEEPLY INTO THAT NOT SPIN WITH THOSE NUT SLOTS AND THAT CAN CAUSE BINDING
gyRlgBAT2Lc_6 0 WHAT WE REALLY WOULD LIKE TO DO IS HAVE THE NUT OF STRINGS SIT ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THE NUT SLOT
gyRlgBAT2Lc_7 0 SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO TAKE DOWN SOME OF THE TOP OF THE NOT SO THAT THE STRINGS DON'T HAVE TO SIT SO TIGHTLY IN THOSE IN THOSE SLOTS

hC86qyizBoQ_3 0 IT'S NOT TRULY A DIET IN THE SENSE OF THE WORD
hC86qyizBoQ_4 0 MOST DIETS THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT OR READ ABOUT ARE VERY SPECIFIC MEAL PLANTS IN THE INCLUDE MENUS SPECIFIC FOODS TO EAT
hC86qyizBoQ_5 0 WITH THIS PREMISE IS ALL ITS ASKING IS THAT YOU INCLUDE APPLE CIDER VINEGAR AT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR MEALS
hC86qyizBoQ_6 0 IT DOESN'T RESTRICT ANY FOODS THAT DOESN'T RESTRICT PORTION SIZES
hC86qyizBoQ_7 0 IT'S NOT ASKING YOU TO EAT CERTAIN FOODS THE ONLY THING IT'S ASK YOU TO DO IS ADD APPLE CIDER VINEGAR TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR MEALS
hC86qyizBoQ_8 0 THE PREMISE BEHIND IT IS AT THE VINEGAR WELL ACTUALLY SPEED UP YOUR METABOLISM AND CAUSE YOU TO BURN OFF THE FOOD THAT YOU'RE EATING MUCH MORE RAPIDLY
hC86qyizBoQ_9 0 THERE'S NO SCIENTIFIC DATA BEHIND THIS DIET
hC86qyizBoQ_10 0 THERE IS NO PROOF THAT THIS WILL ACTUALLY WORK
hC86qyizBoQ_11 0 THERE'S NO PROOF THAT IT WILL SPEED OF YOUR METABOLISM ANYWAY
hC86qyizBoQ_12 0 SO APPLE CIDER VINEGAR IN ITSELF IT'S NOT AN HEALTHY THING TO USE BUT IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT'S A MIRACLE WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENT
hC86qyizBoQ_13 0 IT'S NOT GOING TO CAUSE YOU TO LOSE A LOT OF WEIGHT
hC86qyizBoQ_14 0 IT CAN BE A HEALTHY ADDITION TO A MEAL FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A SALAD WITH THE VINEGAR AT DRESSING IN THE VINEGAR IT PART OF IT IS APPLE CIDER VINEGAR
hC86qyizBoQ_15 0 IT'S PERFECTLY FINE TO USE THAT
hC86qyizBoQ_16 0 THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH APPLE CIDER VINEGAR BUT AGAIN IT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO MAKE YOU LOSE WEIGHT
hC86qyizBoQ_17 0 IT'S NOT GOING TO INCREASE YOUR METABOLISM
hC86qyizBoQ_18 0 SO SOME THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND ABOUT THE APPLE CIDER VINEGAR DIET
gHpdEbTvkMY_1 0 SO WITH THIS COULD BE A STEP THIS SIDE STEP WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS STEP NOW AND ADD SOME VARIATIONS TO IT
gHpdEbTvkMY_2 0 HERE'S THE BASIC STEP
gHpdEbTvkMY_3 0 RIGHT TOGETHER RIGHT SLIDE LEFT TOGETHER LEFT SLIDE
gHpdEbTvkMY_4 0 THE FIRST VARIATION WE'RE GOING TO ADD ON TO THAT IS KIND OF IT'S A DOUBLE STEP
gHpdEbTvkMY_5 0 WE'RE GOING TO DO IT DOUBLE
gHpdEbTvkMY_6 0 TWICE AS THAT I WANT
gHpdEbTvkMY_7 0 YOU'RE GOING TO GO ONE TWO THREE FOUR HOLES ON
gHpdEbTvkMY_8 0 BUT LET ME DO THAT AGAIN
gHpdEbTvkMY_9 0 ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN
gHpdEbTvkMY_10 0 AN EIGHT SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A FULLY COME TO THE RIGHT OF FULLY COUNT TO THE LEFT
gHpdEbTvkMY_12 0 IT GOES RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT SO IT'S THE DOUBLE
gHpdEbTvkMY_14 0 LET'S TAKE IT FROM THE BASIC
gHpdEbTvkMY_15 0 YOU'RE GOING TO GO ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT
gHpdEbTvkMY_16 0 HERE'S THE DOUBLE
gHpdEbTvkMY_17 0 THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT
gHpdEbTvkMY_18 0 JUST TO BREAK IT DOWN ALL YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE STEPPING OUT DRAGGING THAT LEFT FOOT STEPPING AND DRAGGING
gHpdEbTvkMY_19 0 STEPPING DRAGGING IT IN
gHpdEbTvkMY_20 0 ON THE WAY BACK IT'S THE SAME THING STEPPING OUT AND DRAPE
gHpdEbTvkMY_21 0 AND THAT IS THE DOUBLE STEP FOR CAN BE OUT
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_1 0 SOMETIMES WHEN YOUR DESIGNS THAT YOU MIGHT THINK WHILE IS A ROOM FOR INNOVATION HERE WHAT CAN I DO THE DIFFERENCE
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_2 0 AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT DON'T STRESS IS ALL OUT TOO MUCH YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE INNOVATIVE OR ALL THE TIME
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_3 0 YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE NEW THINGS JUST THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR AND IF YOU FEEL YOUR IN CREATIVE ONE DAY JUST DO WHAT I DO
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_4 0 I WILL TAKE A BASIC SILHOUETTE HERE I HAVE VOID GREASE BOY SHORTS
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_5 0 AND WHAT I DID WAS I DREW A DESIGN ON THEM AND THAT SYMBOLIZES IT DIFFERENT FABRICS THAT ARE COMBINES MAKE THAT
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_6 0 AND IT CAN BE YOUR YOUR COLLECTION CAN BE INTRINSICALLY YOU BY THE WAY YOU COMBINE FABRICS
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_7 0 IT CAN BE THE MOST SIMPLE SILHOUETTE BUT THE WAY YOU COMBINE THE FABRICS AND THE DRAWINGS IN AND THEN GEOMETRIC LINES YOU MAKE AUTUMN MAKES IT COMPLETELY YOUR OWN
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_8 0 THINK OF ABSTRACT ARE THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING AND WHAT I DID THAT
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_9 0 I THOUGHT TOUGH BOY SHORT AGAIN
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_10 0 BUT I ADDED IN THE PANELS AND WASTE BENT AND IT CREATED SOMETHING THAT WAS COMPLETELY MEAT AND MY OWN
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_11 0 SO I DON'T REALLY THINK AND YOU DRAW ANOTHER PAIR OF WHICH WORKS FOR YOU
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_12 0 BUT WE WILL JUST REVIEW IT
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_13 0 MAKE YOUR WAISTLINE DECIDE WHERE YOU WANT YOUR LEGS TO CANNOT DO AND THEN LIKE I DID THE PANEL AND I CREATED WE STAND
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_14 0 THERE YOU GO
GMW1RxM8NsA_1 0 HI
GMW1RxM8NsA_2 0 MY NAME IS DARREN STORR ON AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU GUYS HOW TO RUN A HUNDRED METERS SUCCESSFULLY
GMW1RxM8NsA_3 0 AND LIKE I SAY THIS IS A STYER RACER EACH ONE IS YOU WANT IT BEHIND A PERSON AND THEY'RE RUNNING FALL POSITION INTO THAT EVENT OR INTO THE RICE
GMW1RxM8NsA_4 0 NORMALLY AROUND SIX HUNDRED METERS SO SO YOU WOULD HAVE A RUN A STARTING TO BREAK DOWN BECAUSE THAT LACTIC ACID EXPLAIN AND THIS IS WHERE YOU GO OFF TO THE ONE TO RUN EFFICIENTLY AND SMALL FOR A HUNDRED
GMW1RxM8NsA_5 0 THE DIFFERENCE IS YOU GO TO LAPS AND MOST ONE IS LIKE I SAID THEY WOULD WANT TO RUN IN BETWEEN FIFTY FIFTY BY SECONDS EACH LATCH
GMW1RxM8NsA_6 0 SO THIS IS MORE OF ATTACK TO PRACTICE RACE BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE
gB4vedWyOa4_1 0 SO AFTER THAT DOUBLE DON'T WE JUST KEEP WE NEED SOMETHING TO KIND OF FILL IN THE RHYTHM THERE AND IT'S JUST IT'S A REAL FACT I'VE HAD SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO KIND OF SUPPLE BACKWARD AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP OUR LEG
gB4vedWyOa4_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO GO RIGHT LEFT AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE OF THE STRING PULLS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER SO THE RHYTHM IS GOING TO GO ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE
gB4vedWyOa4_3 0 THERE'S A LITTLE PAUSE YOU STEP RIGHT LEFT AND A STRING PULL
gB4vedWyOa4_4 0 SO JUST REMEMBER AFTER THAT KNIFE ONE YOU STEP LEFT AS A PREP STEP STEP BUT YOUR BIG STEP THE RIGHT AND LEFT AND THEN YOUR STRING PULL
gB4vedWyOa4_5 0 SO LET'S TRY THAT WITH THE DRUM
gB4vedWyOa4_6 0 WE'LL JUST WILL GIVE THEM A FOUR COUNT ON THE WAY IN AND WE'LL PRETEND THAT WE ALREADY DID THE DOUBLE JUMP AND A SHUFFLE LEFT AND
gB4vedWyOa4_7 0 LET'S TRY THAT ONE MORE TIME TO DRY
gB4vedWyOa4_8 0 THAT SO YOU JUST SHUFFLING YOUR ARMS ARE FOLLOWING YOUR MOST OF YOUR FOOT MOTION JUST REMEMBER TO KIND OF SWIVEL YOUR HIPS ON THAT FIRE AND THEN A QUICK STRING PULL
GSdywZYtP3g_1 0 HI I'M AMELIA AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO REMOVE STATIC FROM THE HAIR
GSdywZYtP3g_2 0 WHAT CAUSES STATIC IS DRYNESS IN THE ENVIRONMENT
GSdywZYtP3g_3 0 SO ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE USING A QUALITY CONDITIONER AT HOME OR EVEN A LEAVE IN CONDITIONER ON TOP OF THAT IF YOU'RE REALLY HAVING AN ISSUE WITH STATIC ON A REGULAR BASIS
GSdywZYtP3g_4 0 FINE HAIR DOES TEND TO ATTRACT IT MORE THAN COARSER HAIR
GSdywZYtP3g_6 0 I DON'T KNOW
GSdywZYtP3g_7 0 IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS
GSdywZYtP3g_8 0 SO WHEN YOU'VE GOT STATIC GOING ON YOU CAN TRY A LITTLE BIT OF WATER AND JUST SPRAY IT
GSdywZYtP3g_9 0 WHAT THAT'LL DO THAT WILL ADD THE MOISTURE BACK INTO THE HAIR AND COMB IT DOWN
GSdywZYtP3g_10 0 ANOTHER THING THAT WORKS WELL IS HAIRSPRAY
GSdywZYtP3g_11 0 AGAIN YOU JUST SLIGHTLY SPRAY
GSdywZYtP3g_12 0 ANYTHING IS GOING TO BASICALLY AND MOISTURE BACK INTO THE HAIR
GSdywZYtP3g_13 0 A DRIER SHEET WORKS WELL EVEN THOUGH I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THAT ACTUALLY IS METHOD DOESN'T WORK IT WELL
GSdywZYtP3g_14 0 BUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING TO WORK THE BEST IS YOUR WATER YOUR HAIR SPRAY
GSdywZYtP3g_15 0 YOU CAN ALSO WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR BRUSH TENDS TO ATTRACT A LOT OF STATIC YOU CAN IN THE WINTER LIGHTLY SPRAY YOUR BRUSH WITH SOME HAIRSPRAY
GSdywZYtP3g_16 0 ANOTHER GOOD THING THAT WORKS REALLY WELL IS STATIC GUARD WHICH WE ALL KNOW FROM USING ON OUR SKIRTS WITH HOSE
GSdywZYtP3g_17 0 YOU JUST SPRAY A LITTLE BIT ON YOUR BRUSH OR A LITTLE BIT ON YOUR HAIR AND THAT WILL DEFINITELY GET RID OF THE STATIC
GSdywZYtP3g_18 0 SO JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU USE A CONDITIONER IN THE SHOWER AFTER YOU SHAMPOO SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO TANGLES AND IF IT'S REALLY BAD A LEAVE IN CONDITIONER BEFORE YOU STYLE AND THEN AGAIN YOU COULD TRY STATIC GUARD HAIRSPRAY WATER
GSdywZYtP3g_19 0 JUST REMEMBER YOU NEED TO ADD MOISTURE BACK INTO THE ENVIRONMENT
GSdywZYtP3g_20 0 YOU CAN EVEN KEEP A HUMIDIFIER RUNNING AT ALL TIMES AND THAT WILL HELP TO BECAUSE STATIC DOES TEND TO HAPPEN IN THE WINTER WHEN THINGS ARE A LOT DRYER
GSdywZYtP3g_21 0 SO BY USING THOSE THE ITEMS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET STATIC CONTROL

H5rPVr2yZ6M_3 0 THE SPACE TO BUSHING GOES ON BETWEEN THE ACTUAL BELT IN THE CAR ITSELF
H5rPVr2yZ6M_4 0 AND THAT ALLOWS THE SEATBELT TO MOVE ON THE ON THE MALE AND FEMALE LEFT SIDE
H5rPVr2yZ6M_5 0 AND IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT YOU PUT THESE IN CORRECTLY AND TIGHTEN DOWN CORRECTLY BECAUSE YOUR LINES DEPEND ON THEM ON

gkyD3XAO78k_1 0 WHENEVER YOU PURCHASE FRESH FLOWERS YOU WANT TO ENJOY THEM AS LONG AS POSSIBLE SO USUALLY YOU GET A PACKAGE OF PRESERVATIVE SUCH AS THIS OF BUT THE BEST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS ADD THIS TO IT
gkyD3XAO78k_2 0 AND THERE'S OTHER THINGS YOU CAN AND YOU CAN ADD A LITTLE BIT OF BLEACH YOU CAN ADD A SEVEN UP OR LIKE A CITRIC ACID BASED SO WHAT DO YOU KNOW THE CITRIC ACID IS WHAT HELPS TO REHYDRATE FLOWERS
gkyD3XAO78k_3 0 I'M GOING TO WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THE CONTAINER THAT YOU HAVE THE FLOWERS IN IS FILLED WITH WATER EVERY DAY BECAUSE THE FLOWERS WILL DRINK WATER IN A THEY'LL TRY A LITTLE BIT EACH DAY
gkyD3XAO78k_4 0 SO IF THE THE WATER LEVEL IN THE VASE DROPS THESE WITH THE STEMS ARE THE STEMS ARE GOING TO SEAL UP

gkyD3XAO78k_6 0 THE FLOOR PRESERVATIVE IS GOOD BECAUSE IT HELPS KEEP THE WATER CLEAN BUT AS LONG AS YOU'RE ADDING WATER AND THEN DUMPING OUT THE DIRTY WATER
gkyD3XAO78k_7 0 THEN YOU KNOW THAT'S THE BEST THING FOR THE FLOWERS
gkyD3XAO78k_8 0 THE BLEACH IS PRETTY GOOD BUT YOU KNOW TOO MUCH BLEACH WILL TEND TO DO IS CALLED THE FLOWERS SO YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT

G68Be5D5BrA_4 0 A ONE THE MOVEMENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO DEMONSTRATE TODAY IS A LARGER MOVEMENT CONTEL MOVEMENT THAT INVOLVES A LOT OF JOINTS AND MUSCLES

G68Be5D5BrA_14 0 THE RESCIND TRICK IS ON THE WAY DOWN
G68Be5D5BrA_15 0 NICE AND CONTROLLING THE CONCENTRIC IS A LITTLE FASTER THEM AWAY UP CAUSE THERE
G68Be5D5BrA_17 0 PRIMARILY WORKING ALL THE MUSCLES AND THE JOINT
G68Be5D5BrA_18 0 IT'S A BIG MULTI JOINT MULTI MUSCLE MOVEMENT
G68Be5D5BrA_19 0 THIS IS GREG AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR DEMONSTRATION OF WEIGHT TRAINING FOR WOMEN
HB01hhonf8Q_1 0 BEHIND THE BACK GRABS IN FRONT OF THE BODY GRABS NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO THE FINAL SECTION OF THE YELLOW BELT TEST WHICH IS STRIKES
HB01hhonf8Q_2 0 THE FIRST STRIKE IS CALLED MOVING THAT SKI
HB01hhonf8Q_3 0 WHEN IT AGAIN IS MID LEVEL SKI BEING STRIKE
HB01hhonf8Q_4 0 SO WHEN THAT SKI GO TO GUESS SHE IS THE TECHNIQUE
HB01hhonf8Q_5 0 AS HE GOES INTO STRIKE HE HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT HE PUNCHES ME IN THE STOMACH
HB01hhonf8Q_6 0 ONE OF MY WORST PET PEEVES WHEN PEOPLE PUNCH OUT HERE
HB01hhonf8Q_7 0 IT OFF
HB01hhonf8Q_8 0 I DON'T CARRY PUNCHES OUT HERE IF HE DOES THAT ALL DAY LONG ALWAYS DOING IS FANNING ME
HB01hhonf8Q_9 0 IT'S MAKING THE COOL OFF
HB01hhonf8Q_10 0 SO HE HAS THE PUNCH LIKE HE'S GOING TO MAKE YOU SEE MY LUNCH
HB01hhonf8Q_11 0 AS HE DOES THAT I DO MY TEN CALM MOTION THAT WE TALK ABOUT THE VERY BEGINNING THIS TURNING MOTION
HB01hhonf8Q_12 0 SO AS HE STRIKES I TEND CON CONTROL THIS WRIST AND BRING THEM BACK AROUND
HB01hhonf8Q_13 0 PRINCIPLE OF DYNAMIC REVERSAL
HB01hhonf8Q_14 0 IT'S A BAD SPOT TURN SOMEONE RIGHT AROUND INTO THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE GIVING HIM MOMENTUM TO STRIKE YOU WITH
HB01hhonf8Q_15 0 IF YOU WATCH AS OTHER HAND I MOVE HE COULD REALLY CLEAN YOUR CLOCK FROM HERE
HB01hhonf8Q_16 0 SO YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL THIS WRIST FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
HB01hhonf8Q_18 0 FROM HERE FOR COATING ACTUALLY LIKE I TALKED BEFORE IS NOT A WRIST LOCK OUT TO THE SIDE LIKE THIS
HB01hhonf8Q_19 0 A LOT OF STYLES LIKE EDO YOU'LL SEE A BIG HUGE WRIST LOCK GET WHICH GIVES IT A REALLY PRETTY FALL IT'S A VERY IMPRESSIVE ON CAMERA
HB01hhonf8Q_20 0 BUT IN REALITY GETTING A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO PUNCH OR TO JUST KNOCK MY HANDS OFF AND PUT ME AND GO TO GET YOU MYSELF
HB01hhonf8Q_21 0 SO INSTEAD WE KEEP OUR CUT AGAIN SHE'S VERY SMALL FOR AND YOU'LL SEE FROM THE NEXT ONE I CONTROL THE ENTIRE BODY WITH THIS HOW A FACE
HB01hhonf8Q_22 0 YOU'LL ALSO SEE I MOVE RIGHT INTO THE PIN THAT I DISCUSSED BEFORE
HB01hhonf8Q_23 0 EXTENDING THE SHOULDER INTO THE GROUND MAINTAINING CONTROL I'VE GOT MY ENTIRE WORKSPACE LAID OUT BEFORE ME
HB01hhonf8Q_24 0 I USED TO DO THIS TECHNIQUE TO PIN THE OUTSIDE OF THE SURF MOVE AWAY THESE TWO IT'S TOO EASY FOR ME TO LOSE THAT
HB01hhonf8Q_25 0 SO FROM HERE I'VE GOT HIM PINNED HERE AND IF HE STARTS TO GET AWAY I CAN TRANSITION TO A STRIKE TO AHEAD GRAB TO A KNEE DROP ANYTHING THAT I NEED IS RIGHT HERE MY FEET
HB01hhonf8Q_26 0 CONTROL ARM STEP AWAY
hiZ6DKSaizA_1 0 IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING AN EXERCISE PROGRAM TO GET STRONGER ARMS I'VE GOT SOME GREAT TIPS FOR YOU
hiZ6DKSaizA_2 0 THIS IS AUSIMONT START AND THE FIRST EXERCISE WE'RE GOING TO DO IS A PUSH UP
hiZ6DKSaizA_3 0 PUSH UP IS A GREAT EXERCISE BECAUSE IT NOT ONLY DEVELOPS ARM STRENGTH IN THE TRICEP PARTICULAR TRICEP ALSO THE CHEST AS WELL
hiZ6DKSaizA_4 0 WE CAN DO THEM IN A MODIFIED POSITION WHICH WOULD BE ON THE KNEES
hiZ6DKSaizA_5 0 THE HIPS ROLL FORWARD
hiZ6DKSaizA_6 0 THE SPINE STAYS IN NEUTRAL WHICH MEANS THE HEAD HAS TO STAY LIFTED
hiZ6DKSaizA_7 0 THE ELBOWS GO OUT TO THE SIDE AND YOU EXHALE AS YOU LIFT UP INHALE AS YOU GET DOWN EXHALE AS YOU LIFT UP
hiZ6DKSaizA_8 0 AVOID LEAVING THE GLUTES AND THE AIR OR SAGGING THROUGH THE LOW BACK
hiZ6DKSaizA_9 0 SO THAT'S ONE GREAT ARM EXERCISE TO INCORPORATE TO GET STRONGER ARMS
hiZ6DKSaizA_10 0 THE OTHERS ARE DONE WITH FREE WEIGHTS OR DUMBBELLS AND YOU CAN DO SIDE LATERAL RAISES SO STANDING WITH THE FEET HIP DISTANCE APART SOFTEN THE KNEES SHOULDERS BACK AND LIFT YOUR ARMS TO THE SIDE
hiZ6DKSaizA_11 0 YOU CAN ALSO DO THAT IN AN OVERHEAD PRESS AGAIN FOR THE SHOULDERS
hiZ6DKSaizA_12 0 YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RANGE OF MOTION TO GO TO THE SIDE AND YOU CAN ALSO INCORPORATE SOME BICEP CURLS AND TRICEP PRESSES
hiZ6DKSaizA_13 0 ALL OF THESE EXERCISES ARE GOING TO GET YOUR ARMS STRONGER BUT MY ADVICE TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF A PERSONAL TRAINER AS THEY CAN HELP DEVELOP A PROGRAM BASED ON YOUR INITIAL FITNESS LEVEL AND YOUR GOALS
hiZ6DKSaizA_14 0 THIS IS ALSO ONCE OR HAVE A GREAT DAY

g-VDa76uTYQ_1 0 HI I'M KARINA FRALEY FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LITTLE LEAGUE
g-VDa76uTYQ_2 0 ONCE YOU'VE ENROLLED YOUR CHILD AND AND HAVE DETERMINED WHERE CHILD IS GOING TO PLAY YOU REALLY NEED TO STICK YOUR CHILD DOWN AND EXPLAIN TO THEM THE HISTORY OF LITTLE LEAGUE AN A AND THE MISSION STATEMENT THAT REALLY IS TO ENCOURAGE SPORTSMANSHIP AND A SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND TO CREATE REALLY GREAT AND POSITIVE MEMORIES
g-VDa76uTYQ_3 0 WHEN THEY GO OUT ON THAT FIELD SO THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO WEAR THE UNIFORM PROUDLY AND THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO REALLY DO RIGHT BY THE HISTORY OF LITTLE LEAK
g-VDa76uTYQ_4 0 YOU WANT TO TEACH THEM THAT THEY'RE NOT TO CAUSE FIGHTS OR CALL NAMES OR MAKE FUN OF ANY OTHER PLAYER OR ANY OTHER TEAM
g-VDa76uTYQ_5 0 THEY HAVE TO BE GRACIOUS WINNERS AS WELL AS GRACIOUS LOSERS
g-VDa76uTYQ_6 0 REALLY CAN BE A LOT OF FUN BUT AS EVERYTHING ELSE YOU HAVE TO TEACH YOUR CHILD'S JUST SOME BASIC GUIDELINES AND RULES SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BECOME COMPETITIVE DOESN'T BECOME A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE FOR THEM
H0QQv5UrmNQ_2 0 IT IS TRUE THAT DOGS ARE DERIVATIVE FROM GRAY WOLFS AND ARE PACKING ANIMALS
H0QQv5UrmNQ_3 0 IN MY OPINION DOGS NEED FOR THE TEN PLAYMATES NOT FORTY
H0QQv5UrmNQ_4 0 OFTEN TIMES CUSTOMERS CALL ME AND WE'LL TRY TO TALK TO ME FOR AN HOUR OF WHY THEY THINK EVERY DOG SHOULD BE TAKEN TO A DOG PARK
H0QQv5UrmNQ_5 0 I PULL LIGHTLY LET THEM KNOW THAT FROM MY EXPERIENCE AND THE REASON I STARTED MY COMPANY WAS BECAUSE EYEWITNESS TIME AND TIME AGAIN ON THE HEALTHY ON TRAIN DOGS IN DOG PARKS
H0QQv5UrmNQ_6 0 I ALSO FIND THAT FOR CLEANLINESS HEALTH DOG PARKS MORE TIME THAN NOT OR NOT KEPT UP TO A CLEANLINESS STANDARD THAT I UPHOLD WITH MY PETS
H0QQv5UrmNQ_7 0 EVEN IF YOUR DOG IS HAD SHOTS AND IS HEALTHY AND THERE'S A CHANCE AT A DOG PARK THEY COULD PICK UP A DISEASES OR GET IN A ALTER KAISHA WITH THE DOG RESULTING IN A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE THAT COULD EFFECT THE TRAINING AND ALL THE TIME YOU PUT INTO YOUR DOG
H0QQv5UrmNQ_8 0 SO MY OPINION IF YOU GO TO A DOG PARK BE VERY AWARE ONE OTHER DOGS ARE THERE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE THERE AND KEEP A CLOSE CYAN THE DOG INTERACTION TO MAKE SURE IT'S A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE
H0QQv5UrmNQ_9 0 MY MY RECOMMENDATION LIKE I SAID IS HAVING FRIENDS AND FAMILY WITH JUST THREE TO FIVE DOGS THAT YOUR DOGS CAN HAVE PLAYED DATES WITH WEEKLY TO STILL GET THEM PROPERLY SOCIALIZED
heRDkIYxyDs_1 0 YOU KNOW THAT EVEN PROGRAMS MADE FOR WINDOWS TWO THOUSAND RUN ON VISTA
heRDkIYxyDs_2 0 HI I'M DAN AFONSO OF AFONSO CONSULTING AND FOLDED TEA AND THIS IS HOW TO RUN ALL PROGRAMS IN VISTA
heRDkIYxyDs_3 0 NOW THIS THE HANDLES A LOT OF THE COMPACT COMPATIBILITY WORK BEHIND THE SCENES
heRDkIYxyDs_4 0 YOU NEVER GOING TO SEE IT IT JUST KIND OF WORKS BUT THEY'RE GOING TO BE PROBLEMS WHEN THE PROGRAM NEEDS VERY SPECIFIC FEATURES VERY SPECIFIC OPERATING SYSTEMS OR REQUIRES ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS
heRDkIYxyDs_5 0 A GOOD EXAMPLE THIS IS MOST VIDEO GAMES GENERALLY ASSUME THAT THEY HAVE FULL RANGE OF THE MACHINE GENERALLY THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY AND BAD ASSUMPTION BUT IT IS ANNOYING IN VISTA BECAUSE THIS INSTEAD OF SIMPLY ALLOWING THIS WILL TYPICALLY POP UP WARNINGS SO IN ORDER TO TRY IT OUT FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO BRING UP SOMETHING
heRDkIYxyDs_6 0 I'M GOING TO THEM SCRAP A GAME HERE RIGHT AT IT AND IF YOU JUST WANT TO SEE THAT A GAME THAT WAS WORKING OR ANY PROGRAM REALLY WASN'T WORKING BEFORE TRY IT OUT JUST RIGHT CLICK ON IT AND OR AS ADMINISTRATOR OBVIOUSLY I'M ASSUMING YOU HAVE FULL CONTROL THE MACHINE AND THE ADMINISTRATOR PASSWORD
heRDkIYxyDs_7 0 WHEN YOU RUN IT LIKE THIS IT WILL THEN GO IN AND RUN UNDER FULL PRIVILEGE MILK THAT FIX IS THE ISSUE WHAT YOU NOW NEED TO DO IS TO RIGHT CLICK ON IT CLICK ON PROPERTIES GO OVER TO COMPATIBILITY AND RUN AND CHECK OUT FROM THIS PROGRAM AS ADMINISTRATOR
heRDkIYxyDs_8 0 THIS WILL ALWAYS MAKE IT START OUT BY DEFAULT AS AN ADMINISTRATOR
heRDkIYxyDs_9 0 AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS WHEN YOU DO IT IT WILL POP UP A WARNING EVERY TIME YOU TRY TO START THE APPLICATION
heRDkIYxyDs_10 0 ANOTHER OPTION YOU HAVE THESE IF IT REQUIRES CERTAIN FEATURES BUGS OR CORKS OF A CERTAIN OPERATING SYSTEM THERE'S AN OPTION UNDER MOST OF THESE UNDER COMPATIBILITY TO RUN IT AND COMPATIBILITY MODE FOR WHATEVER APPLICATION YOU WANT
heRDkIYxyDs_11 0 YOU CAN EVEN GO BACK AS FAR AS AN TEA FOR POINT OH AS YOUR FULL AS YOUR COMPATIBILITY VERSION ALLOWING YOU TO GET SOME REALLY OLD CRANKY APPLICATIONS TO RUN UNDER VISTA
heRDkIYxyDs_12 0 I'M DAN AFONSO AND THIS HAS BEEN HOW TO RUN OLDER APPLICATIONS UNDER VISTA
HcXTE9nwihA_1 0 NEXT YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS YOUR PROPER LIGHTING IN HEATING FOR CRESTED GECKO
HcXTE9nwihA_2 0 CRESCENT GECKOS ARE TROPICAL SPECIES THEY DON'T NEED IS AS MUCH HEATING SAI DESERT SPECIES DOES BUT A LITTLE BITTY HEATING MY STILL BE NECESSARY DEPENDING ON YOUR HOME
HcXTE9nwihA_3 0 YOU NEED TO KEEP THE KEEP THE GET GO ANYWHERE BETWEEN SEVENTY TWO TO SEVENTY FIVE DEGREES TEMPERATURE
HcXTE9nwihA_4 0 YOU CAN GO A LITTLE BIT HIGHER BUT DON'T GO TOO MUCH MORE THAN EIGHTY FIVE AND IT'S IN A STRETCHED IMAGINATION
HcXTE9nwihA_5 0 I'M SO OFTEN CASE A SIMPLE HEAT PICTURE JUST LIKE THIS A LAMP WITH A CERAMIC TOP ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A CERAMIC TOP AND A TWENTY FIVE OR FIFTY WATT BALL USUALLY SEVENTY FIVE TOPS WILL DO YOU AS FAR AS HEATING GOES
HcXTE9nwihA_6 0 AGAIN YOU'RE NOT LOOKING FOR A SUPER HIGH TEMPERATURES YOU WANT TO KEEP THE CAGE A CONSTANT SLIGHTLY WARM TEMPERATURE JUST ABOVE THAT YOU PROBABLY KEEP YOUR HOUSE THAT
HcXTE9nwihA_7 0 THE OTHER THING YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT ALSO IS THE UVB LIGHT
HcXTE9nwihA_8 0 UVB LIGHT IS COMES FROM FLUORESCENT FIXTURES EITHER COMPACT OR THE GOOD OLD TUBE FIXTURE WHAT THAT DOES THE UVB GIVES THE ANIMAL UVB LIGHT WHICH HE NEEDS TO CREATE VITAMIN D THREE IN HIS BODY AND MOVE CALCIUM IN THE BONE STRUCTURE
HcXTE9nwihA_9 0 IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THING TO HAVE ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG ANIMALS AS THEY'RE GROWING IN THE NEEDLE THAT ALL THE CALCIUM THEY CAN GET
HcXTE9nwihA_10 0 THIS WILL PROBABLY NOT GOING TO PUT UP A LOT OF HEAT BUT IT COULD IF YOU'RE KEEPING YOUR HOUSE IN THE SEVENTY TWO OR THREE AIRY ARE READY TO PUT ONE OF THESE IS PROBABLY ENOUGH TO KEEP YOUR CRESCENT GECKO NICE AND HAPPY
HcXTE9nwihA_11 0 WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR A CRESCENT GECKO I'M KATE CAGE IS NOT TO THE HIGH HEATS BUT YOU DO WANT TO HIGH HUMIDITY
HcXTE9nwihA_12 0 YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO KEEP THE THE HUMIDITY UP IN THE HEAT TO AROUND SEVENTY TO SEVENTY FIVE DEGREES

GV8RcNRQUVI_9 0 HOLD THE CORNERS TOGETHER HOLD FIRMLY AND THEN INCREASE THE CARD LIKE THIS
GV8RcNRQUVI_10 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO OPEN IT UP AND FOLD IT WITH A LONG WAY JUST LIKE THAT
GV8RcNRQUVI_11 0 SO FIRST TO MAKE THE MOUTH OF THE FROG
GV8RcNRQUVI_12 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A CUT ABOUT AN INCH AND A HALF AN
GV8RcNRQUVI_13 0 YOU CAN MEASURE IT IF YOU LIKE BUT YOU CAN JUST GUESS
GV8RcNRQUVI_14 0 IT'S NOT A PARTICULAR THAT YOU BE EXACTLY AN INCH AND A HALF
GV8RcNRQUVI_15 0 YOU CAN MAKE YOUR FROG ANY SIZE YOU WANT

GV8RcNRQUVI_23 0 AND YOU JUST SNIP RIGHT LIKE THAT
GV8RcNRQUVI_24 0 THEN WE'RE GOING TO FOLD THAT BACK
GV8RcNRQUVI_25 0 JUST LIKE WE DID WITH THE OTHER ONE BUT IT'S A LOT SMALLER
GV8RcNRQUVI_26 0 OKAY

GZl_mP67NsA_1 0 SO THE NEXT STEP AFTER YOU'VE TUNED WITH THE PIANO AND BEFORE YOU START PLAYING AS YOU WANT TO FIND A GOOD POSITION FROM THE PIANO
GZl_mP67NsA_2 0 SO IF YOU PRETEND THAT THE PIANO IS RIGHT HERE AND LET'S SAY YOU HAVE YOU COME IN THIS RIGHT HERE ALONG WITH THE PAGE TURN
GZl_mP67NsA_3 0 IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU CAN HAVE A SITE LINE WITH THE COMPASS
GZl_mP67NsA_4 0 IT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT AS I LINE WITH THE PICTURE IS REALLY ALL THEIR MAIN DRAW THIS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TURNING THE PAGES THAT PIANIST CAN KEEP PLAYING A STRAIGHT THROUGH WITH YOU
GZl_mP67NsA_5 0 SO REALLY POSITION YOURSELF RIGHT AFTER YOU'VE TUNE AND FINDING A GOOD SPOT MAYBE RIGHT HERE SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF AN ANGLE
GZl_mP67NsA_6 0 YOU SHOULD BE SOMEWHAT OF A LITTLE ANGLE BETWEEN YOU AND PIANIST
GZl_mP67NsA_7 0 SO YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE TO THEM THAT YOU'RE READY
GZl_mP67NsA_8 0 ONCE YOU'VE DONE YOUR POSITION THEN YOU CAN SET UP YOUR VIOLIN A AND GIVE THEM A SIGNAL
GZl_mP67NsA_9 0 AND DEPENDING ON WHAT PIECE YOU'RE PLAYING SOME PIECES THERE'LL BE A PIANO INTRO OR SOME PIECES YOU START PLAYING WITH THE PIANO
GZl_mP67NsA_10 0 IF THERE IS A PIANO INTRO ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS JUST POSITION YOURSELF AND THEN JUST GIVE THEM A SINGLE THAT YOU'RE READY
GZl_mP67NsA_11 0 THE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT PLAYING A BEGINNING OLLIE NEED IS A LITTLE SIGNAL TO LET THEM KNOW THAT YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN
HBaiiL17ai0_1 0 SO A QUESTION THAT OFTEN COMES UP REGARDED INJURY DO IS I AM I STUCK WITH THAT JUST WANT TO THAT ONE NOTE THAT ONE FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY
HBaiiL17ai0_2 0 AND THE ANSWER IS BASICALLY YES
HBaiiL17ai0_3 0 YOU PRETTY MUCH ARE
HBaiiL17ai0_4 0 THAT'S BASED ON THE LENGTH OF THIS TUBE
HBaiiL17ai0_5 0 THAT'S THE WAY THE INSTRUMENT FUNCTIONS
HBaiiL17ai0_6 0 WITH THAT SAID THERE IS SOME THINGS YOU CAN DO TO KIND OF FOR SOME OTHER NOTES OUT OF IT
HBaiiL17ai0_7 0 ON THIS PARTICULAR DISH REDO WHICH IS BASICALLY A LOW E A AS WE PER BEFORE
HBaiiL17ai0_8 0 BIKE BY PUSHING THE AIR A LITTLE FASTER AND BY PUSHING MY LOWER LIP OUTWARD AGAIN KIND OF FORCE IT UP ABOUT A HALF STEP
HBaiiL17ai0_9 0 AND THAT'S ONE WAY YOU CAN GET A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PITCH OUT OF IT
HBaiiL17ai0_10 0 TO A CERTAIN EXTENT YOU CAN ALSO FORCE THE NO DOWN
HBaiiL17ai0_11 0 IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE THE SAME RESIN QUALITY IS THAT THAT FUNDAMENTALLY PADDLE LONG BUT IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO START WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL ONE
HBaiiL17ai0_12 0 THAT BY BY PUSHING THE CORNERS OF MY MOUTH DOWN I CAN KIND OF GOT NO BELOW THAT THAT BASIC FUNDAMENTAL
HBaiiL17ai0_13 0 THAT IS TO TAKE A LOT OF PRACTICE
HBaiiL17ai0_14 0 THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I LEARNED OVER THE YEARS PLAYING TRUMPET I WAS ABLE TO APPLY IT TO THIS
HBaiiL17ai0_15 0 YOU ALSO FIND IT GETS REDUCE THE INDIVIDUAL INSTRUMENTS WILL VARY A LOT IN THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT
HBaiiL17ai0_16 0 THIS PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES BECAUSE I CAN PUSH IT BOTH UP AND DOWN TOO LARGE ACCENT
HBaiiL17ai0_17 0 IT WORKS PRETTY WELL
HBaiiL17ai0_18 0 SOME DOES REDUCE ARE VERY LOCKED IN
HBaiiL17ai0_19 0 THEY DON'T SEEM TO DO THAT AT ALL
HBaiiL17ai0_20 0 IF YOUR INSTRUMENT DOESN'T SEEM TO WANT TO DO THAT THAT'S OKAY BUT IT IS ONE WAY TO GET SOME OTHER NOTES ARE THE DISH REDO AT LEAST A SLIGHT VARIATION ON JUST THAT ONE FUNDAMENTAL
HBaiiL17ai0_21 0 SO THAT'S ALWAYS YOU CAN GET SOME SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PITCHES OUT AN INDIVIDUAL INSTRUMENT
HBaiiL17ai0_22 0 IF YOU REALLY NEED AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT KEY A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PITCH YOU'RE ONLY SOLUTION UNFORTUNATELY IS TO HAVE MULTIPLE DUE TO REDUCE OF DIFFERENT KEYS
HBaiiL17ai0_23 0 IT COULD BE A LITTLE DECEIVING
HBaiiL17ai0_24 0 IN GENERAL THE PITCHER THE INSTRUMENT IS DETERMINED BY ITS LENGTH BUT THE PHYSICS AND THE GEOMETRY THINK IT BE A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT
HBaiiL17ai0_25 0 THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO KNOW IS TO TRY THE INSTRUMENT OUT AND SEE WHAT KEY IT'S IN
HBaiiL17ai0_26 0 IF YOU'RE SHOPPING FOR ONE ONLINE TYPICALLY ON WEBSITES I SEE THAT THEY'LL PUT THE KEY OF THAT INSTRUMENT SO YOU CAN RELEASE NO AHEAD OF TIME WHAT IT IS
HBaiiL17ai0_27 0 TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THESE TWO TO REDUCE WHICH SEEM TO BE ABOUT THE SAME LENGTH ACTUALLY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCIES
HBaiiL17ai0_28 0 THIS ONE IS ROUGHLY AND BE MORE THAN THIS ONE IS CLOSER TO A LOW D ONE PROBABLY WANT TO KNOW THAT JUST BY LOOKING SO IF YOU'RE SHOPPING FOR DOES REDO THAT NEEDS TO BE A SPECIFIC KEY VERY IMPORTANT YOU GO IN PLAY AND TRY IT OUT AND WHAT IT IS THAT YOU'RE GETTING
GI_l7c94yJY_2 0 THIS IS ALFRED ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GI_l7c94yJY_3 0 ALL RIGHT WHICH SHOULD YOU USE
GI_l7c94yJY_4 0 CASH CREDITOR DEBIT
GI_l7c94yJY_5 0 ONE OF THE EASIEST WAYS TO KEEP TRACK OF YOU'RE SPENDING IS TO HAVE A CHECKING ACCOUNT
GI_l7c94yJY_6 0 THAT WAY WHEN YOU PAY FOR PURCHASE WITH CHECKS FOR YOUR EIGHTEEN AMOR DEBIT CARD YOU ALREADY HAVE A RECORD OF THEM
GI_l7c94yJY_7 0 THEN YOU ONLY NEED TO TRACK A FEW EXPENSES THAT YOU PAY FOR IN CASH
GI_l7c94yJY_8 0 WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HAVING A CHECKING ACCOUNT HE MIGHT ASK
GI_l7c94yJY_9 0 IT'S SAFE
GI_l7c94yJY_10 0 IT'S MUCH SAFER TO WRITE A CHECK THAN TO CARRY CASH
GI_l7c94yJY_11 0 IF FOR EXAMPLE YOU LOSE YOUR CHECKBOOK YOU CAN TELL THE BANK TO CANCEL YOUR CHECKS AND NO ONE ELSE CAN SPEND YOUR MONEY
GI_l7c94yJY_12 0 IT'S CONVENIENT
GI_l7c94yJY_13 0 CHECKING ACCOUNT ARE ALSO CONVENIENT FOR PAIN BILLS
GI_l7c94yJY_14 0 PAIN BY CHECK IS MUCH EASIER AND CHEAPER THAN BUYING A MONEY ORDER AND YOU'LL HAVE PROVE THAT YOU'VE PAY YOUR BILLS
GI_l7c94yJY_15 0 IN ADDITION TO WRITING CHECKS TO MAKE PURCHASES YOU CAN USE AN EIGHTEEN WE'RE DEBIT CARD AT ANY BEING MACHINE GROCERY STORE OR DRUG STORE TO MAKE A PURCHASE
GI_l7c94yJY_16 0 SOME BANKS ALSO OFFER ONLINE BANKING WHICH ALLOW YOU TO CHECK HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE IN YOUR ACCOUNT AND PAY BILLS ONLINE
GI_l7c94yJY_17 0 CREDIT CARDS CAN BE A GREAT TOOL WHEN USED PROPERLY
GI_l7c94yJY_18 0 ONE THING STATEMENTS MAKE IT PRETTY EASY TO TRACK YOUR EXPENSES
GI_l7c94yJY_19 0 IT'S A BAD IDEA TO GET A CREDIT CARD OR LOAN WITHOUT HAVING A BUDGET OR SAVINGS ACCOUNT
GI_l7c94yJY_20 0 IF YOU LIKE THE CONCEPT OF A CREDIT CARD WITHOUT THE INTEREST THAT DEBIT CARD IS A VERY GOOD OPTION
GI_l7c94yJY_21 0 WHEN IT COMES TO CASH IT'S HARD TO SPEND BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
GI_l7c94yJY_22 0 AS WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE ENVELOPE SYSTEM SO YOU DO TEND TO SAVE MORE MONEY
GI_l7c94yJY_23 0 THE DOWNSIDE OF USING CASH IS THAT IT TAKES A LOT MORE DISCIPLINED TO KEEP TRACK OF YOUR CASH PURCHASES

G8DHXsDsSVM_6 0 WHAT THIS DOES IS IT CLOSES THE CHORDS THAT WE OPEN WITH THE HOT TOWEL OR THE HOT WATER
G8DHXsDsSVM_7 0 NEXT YOU WANT TO APPLY HIGH QUALITY AFTERSHAVE BALL
G8DHXsDsSVM_8 0 AVOID AFTERSHAVE COLOGNE DIRECTLY AFTER YOU SHAVE BECAUSE THAT'S THE MAIN FACTOR IS IS NOT NECESSARY AND IT'S KIND OF PAINFUL
G8DHXsDsSVM_9 0 YOU WANT TO DO IS GET SOMETHING LIKE THAT NICE HIGH OFF THE SHADE ON YOUR HAND MASSAGE IT AND APPLY TO YOUR FACE EVERYWHERE WHERE YOU SHAPE
G8DHXsDsSVM_10 0 YOU CAN MASSAGE IT IN NICE AND SMOOTH ALL OVER MAKE SURE YOU GET EVERYTHING

gKDwtAmDGl8_5 0 FIRST OF ALL TO RELY ON PACKAGING LABELS OF COOKBOOKS TO TELL YOU WHAT A PORTION IS
gKDwtAmDGl8_6 0 YOU KNOW YOUR OWN BODY AND YOU CAN DECIDE FOR YOURSELF WHAT A GOOD PORTION IS AND FOR THE MOST PART IT'S A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN THE RESTAURANTS AND THE BLACK SAY THAT IT IS
gKDwtAmDGl8_7 0 IF YOU'RE A SMALLER PERSON AND YOU MIGHT NEED IS NOT AS A SMALL A SMALLER PORTION OF THE LARGER SIZE
gKDwtAmDGl8_8 0 IF YOU'RE EATING OUT FOR EXAMPLE I WOULD RECOMMEND HALF THEME THE AND THE PLATE THAT IS BRIGHT HEEL IN AND SHAKING IT OR HALF ANOTHER MAIL
gKDwtAmDGl8_9 0 A LOT OF TIMES THE PERSON THAT YOU GET OUR RIDICULOUS AND THEY'RE THEY'RE MUCH TOO BIG FOR A SINGLE MELT THAT AND FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO PUT ON HOW TO THINKING THAT THEY SAY THAT'S A SERVING IT MUST BE SERVING SOMEONE EVEN AT ALL

GsSfnOB1Krw_2 0 BOY PROFESSIONAL JEWELER DEMOLISHES AND I AM HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GsSfnOB1Krw_3 0 ALRIGHT NEXT STEP
GsSfnOB1Krw_4 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS GOING TO BE REMOVING THE METAL AWAY FROM THE MAIN PIECE
GsSfnOB1Krw_5 0 AND WHAT I'M GOING TO BE DOING IS I WILL OPEN UP THE SAW ITSELF THE BLADE ITSELF AND REMOVE IT FROM ONE IN THE BASE AND AND THAT WILL BE FIT INTO A HOLE AND THEN I WILL THE PLACE IT BACK INTO THE HOLDER AGAIN THE SAW BLADE AND THEN TIGHTEN IT UP
GsSfnOB1Krw_6 0 THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN REMOVE THE SMALL PIECES THAT HERE THAT'S WHY WE HAD TO MAKE THE HOLE IN THEIR FIRST IS TO PUT THE SAW BLADE AND REMOVE IT FROM THIS ALL THE SAW BLADE IN AND THEN CUT THAT'S GOING TO DO RIGHT NOW
GsSfnOB1Krw_7 0 AND AT THE BASE OF THE SAW BLADE
GsSfnOB1Krw_8 0 WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE LARGER PIECE THAT WORK IT OUT
GsSfnOB1Krw_9 0 WHAT I FADE IT THROUGH THE WHOLE NOW I'M CRANKING DOWN ON THE PLACE AND SOLID BACK INTO THE SAW AND YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A LITTLE FLEXING THE FOOT BUT ONCE I RELEASE IT FROM MY SHOULDER THAT HAS THE TIGHTNESS TO IT AGAIN
GsSfnOB1Krw_10 0 SO I WILL A PICK A LITTLE BIT OF THE BURR LIFE UP AGAIN AND YOU'LL MAKE SURE THAT YOU KIND OF MOVE A LITTLE SLOWLY SO AND JUST GET SOME OF THE BURR LIFE ONTO THE SOCKS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A NICE SMOOTH SMOOTH THIS AGAIN OKAY
GsSfnOB1Krw_11 0 BASICALLY ONCE AGAIN YOU HOLD THE PIECE WITH YOUR HANDS AND THEN YOU JUST MOVE ALONG THE EDGES OF WHERE THE TEMPLATE PLACING IT INSIDE IT WHERE YOU BASICALLY PLACE YOUR DRY IT ON THE TRACING PAPER
GsSfnOB1Krw_12 0 LET ME GET CLOSE TO THE EDGE AND THEN AT THE VERY VERY CAREFUL TO VERY SIMPLE
GsSfnOB1Krw_13 0 AND I ACTUALLY STARTED IN IT
GsSfnOB1Krw_14 0 AND AS WE MOVE AROUND HERE I HAVE IT AT POPULAR ANGLE AT THAT YOU STILL HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO RINSE STRAY HAS A SLOW DOWN ON THE READY TO LEAD WITH THE OTHER AND JUST LET THEM A LITTLE BIT PIECE SHOULD JUST DROP RIGHT NOW
GsSfnOB1Krw_15 0 OKAY THE FIRST HOLE IS OF BEEN REMOVED AND ALL DO THE NEXT SERIES OF FOR RIGHT NOW AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON FROM THERE
h5jC24uGHyo_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO OUTFIT YOUR RAW LET'S LOOK AT HOW THIS ROSS OUTFITTER HERE
h5jC24uGHyo_2 0 TO THE CHICKEN LINES THAT RUN ALONG THE OUTSIDE OF THE RAW IF YOU ARE ON THE WEIGHT OUT OF THE BOAT FOR ANY REASON YOU CAN GRAB HOLD OF THIS AND THAT KEEPS YOU CLOSE TO THE RAFT AND HOPEFULLY YOUR CREW CAN PULL YOU BACK IN
h5jC24uGHyo_3 0 ALSO IF YOU'RE RAFTING AND YOU'RE SITTING INSIDE THE ROCK SO IF YOU'RE ON COMFORTABLE YOU CAN HOLD ON THE OUTSIDE AND HOLD ON THE INSIDE TO IN THAT WAY YOU HAVE A PRETTY SECURE SPOT IN THE BOAT
h5jC24uGHyo_4 0 THESE WE HAVE ON SIDE FOR SO THAT YOU CAN HOLD ON WHEN YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE WOODS AND HAVE THEM UP FRONT
h5jC24uGHyo_5 0 YOU ALSO HAVE A FOUL LINE OR A STERN LINE WE TEND TO HAVE MOST OF OUR BOATS OUTFITTED WITH THE STERN LINE WHICH IS RIGHT ON THE BACK OF THE BOAT HERE
h5jC24uGHyo_6 0 THIS IS TUCKED TOP ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOAT OUT OF THE WAY SO THAT THEY'RE LESS ENTRAPMENT POSSIBILITIES
h5jC24uGHyo_7 0 THE STERN LINE IS USUALLY ABOUT THE LENGTH OF THE BOAT AND IT'S USED TO TIE THE ROUGHED UP WHENEVER YOU STOP
h5jC24uGHyo_8 0 AND THEN YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THE OILS ON PUT IT BACK AWAY SO IT'S OUT OF THE WAY SO YOU KNOW DRAGON A LINE
h5jC24uGHyo_9 0 YOU CAN DAISY CHAIN THE ROPE SO THAT IT'S OUT OF YOUR WAY IN
Ggi8J6RKHUA_1 0 HI I'M MARK MIDDLEBROOK AND I'M HERE IN THE PAUL MARCUS WINES CELLAR AND IN THIS SEGMENT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SPARKLING WINE PRODUCTION METHODS THAT SPECIFICALLY THE TWO MAIN METHODS THAT ARE USED TO MAKE MOST A SPARKLING WINES IN THE WORLD OF THE COMPRESSION PAINTER IN FRANCE OR ITALY OR A SPRAINED UNITED STATES OR ANYWHERE ELSE
Ggi8J6RKHUA_2 0 THIS IS GENERALLY SIMPLER AND LESS EXPENSIVE METHOD IS CALLED THE BULK PROCESS OF THE SHOWER MY METHOD NAMED AFTER THE FRENCH GUY TO DEVELOP THAT MANY YEARS AGO
Ggi8J6RKHUA_3 0 AND THE IDEA IS YOU RE YOU TAKE THE WINE AND YOU PUT IT INTO A LARGE THE VESSEL USUALLY STAINLESS STEEL THESE DAYS AND THEN YOU IT'S ACTUALLY INJECT CARBON DIOXIDE INTO IT AND THAT'S HOW THE BUBBLES GET THERE
Ggi8J6RKHUA_4 0 IT'S VERY EFFICIENT THE YOU KNOW ONCE YOU HAVE THE STEEL TANK THERE
Ggi8J6RKHUA_5 0 AS OR SO YOU CAN MAKE A SPARKLING WINE IT'S RELATIVELY MODEST IN COSTS A TEN TO FIFTEEN TO TWENTY DOLLARS FOR FOR IN A TRIM MARBLE METHOD WINE
Ggi8J6RKHUA_6 0 ONE IS GOING TO BE FRUITY A LITTLE BIT SIMPLER LARGER BUBBLES I'VE UP PERFECTLY SATISFYING GREAT BRUNCH WINES GREAT FOR STARTING OFF AN EVERYDAY DINNER
Ggi8J6RKHUA_7 0 NOTHING ACTUALLY NOTHING WRONG WITH THE STYLE SPARKLING WINE
Ggi8J6RKHUA_8 0 THE MORE INVOLVED IN CERTAIN MORE EXPENSIVE PROCESS IN TERMS OF OF EFFORT IS CALLED THE TYPICALLY CALLED THE METHODE SHARPEN WAS THE CHAMPAGNE METHOD
Ggi8J6RKHUA_9 0 BECAUSE IT WAS THE PERHAPS NOT INVENTED IN CHAMPAGNE THERE'S A LOT OF ARGUMENT ABOUT THAT BUT IT CERTAINLY HAS REACHED IT'S IT'S ACNE THERE AND SO THAT IS WHERE IT'S IT'S BEST KNOWN
Ggi8J6RKHUA_10 0 IT'S ALSO CALLED A C AND LABELS NECK GO TO THE SCENARIO TRADITIONAL METHOD OF METAL CLASS SEEK THE CLASSIC METHOD
Ggi8J6RKHUA_11 0 ALSO NAMES FOR THE SAME BASIC PROCESS
Ggi8J6RKHUA_12 0 SO AGAIN THAT IS START BY MAKING WHEN MAKING WINE MAKING PRETTY MUCH ORDINARY WINE AND DOWN THEN INSTEAD OF PUTTING INTO A BIG VESSEL AFTER THE FERMENTATION IS COMPLETE THEY ADD A LITTLE BIT OF THE YEAST IN WITH THE SUGAR AND THAT ACTIVATES WHAT'S CALLED A SECONDARY FERMENTATION IN THE BOTTOM
Ggi8J6RKHUA_13 0 THEY CAP IT OFF AND THE AND THE DO THIS ON THE BOTTOM
Ggi8J6RKHUA_14 0 SO IT'S A SECONDARY FERMENTATION IN THE BOTTLE THAT CREATES ABOUT BUBBLES BECAUSE THERE'S NO WEAR FOR THE THE BUBBLING STUFF THAT THE YEAST CREATES BY EATING THE SUGAR
Ggi8J6RKHUA_15 0 YOU KNOW WHERE THAT NOTE NOWHERE FOR THAT TO GO SO IT IS DISSOLVED INTO THE WIND AND CREATES THE BUBBLES THAT YOU SEE A WHEN YOU DRINK IT
Ggi8J6RKHUA_16 0 CHAMPAGNE IS THE MOST FAMOUS THE TOMATOES JUMPING WASN'T A TRADITIONAL LINE BUT MANY THERE ARE MANY OTHER GOOD EXAMPLES FROM COBLEIGH FROM SPAIN AT CERTAIN SPARKLING WINES FROM UNITED STATES
Ggi8J6RKHUA_17 0 I'VE GOT A FEW GOOD ONES FROM TASMANIA AND THAT EVEN IN ITALY AN OFFENSIVE COURT TO FOR EXAMPLE THEY MAKE NICE METHOD JUST IN A WINES
Ggi8J6RKHUA_18 0 SO THESE CAN BE MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE AGAIN IS A LOT MORE EFFORT AND ALL TO TWO TO MAKE TO MAKE THE ONE THAT'S WHERE THE LITTLE BIT MORE ELEGANT WINE
Ggi8J6RKHUA_19 0 THESE AGAIN ARE GREAT EVERYDAY AND SPARKLERS THAT YOU CAN USE TO TO ENJOY SPARKLING WINE MORE OFTEN
gEA3qjf-3DM_1 0 AFTER YOU HAVE YOUR CLUB SINGLE THROW DOWN PRETTY CLEAN YOU CAN TAKE A CLUB IN EACH HAND AND THROW IT TO THE OTHER WITHOUT REALLY WORRYING ABOUT IT IT JUST GOES WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO
gEA3qjf-3DM_2 0 YOU NEED TO PICK UP A SECOND CLUB IT'S START WORKING WITH TWO
gEA3qjf-3DM_3 0 WHEN YOU START JUGGLING WITH CLUBS YOU CAN'T FORGET EVERYTHING YOU LEARNED WHEN YOU START JUGGLING WITH BALLS
gEA3qjf-3DM_4 0 ALL THE THROWS HAVE TO BE THE SAME HEIGHT THEY HAVE TO GO IN THE SAME RHYTHM TO SHOULD BE THROW THROW CATCH CATCH

gEA3qjf-3DM_6 0 LET'S JUST JUMP RIGHT
gEA3qjf-3DM_7 0 I'M GOING TO GRAB ONE CLUB IN EACH HAND AND START THROW THROW CATCH CATCH TOP JUST LIKE YOU DID MANY LEARNED THROUGH THREE BALLS GOING TO LEARN THIS WITH CLUBS
gEA3qjf-3DM_8 0 UM EACH THROW HAS TO GO ACROSS SINGLE SPIN YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S IN TIMES THAT'S THROW THROW CATCH CATCH
gEA3qjf-3DM_9 0 I WANT YOU TO PRACTICE WITH BOTH HANDS MEANING YOU START WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND AND THEN DO IT WITH YOUR LEFT FIRST
gEA3qjf-3DM_10 0 SO IT'S LEFT RIGHT CATCH CATCH RIGHT LEFT CATCH CATCH
gEA3qjf-3DM_11 0 I WANT YOU TO TRY AND KEEP THAT GOING AS FLUIDLY AS POSSIBLE RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT
gEA3qjf-3DM_12 0 YOU TO PRACTICE THAT UNTIL YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT TO ALL THE SPINS WORKOUT PRETTY WELL AND YOU NEED TO REALIZE THERE'S THAT GAP IN BETWEEN THE TWO CLUBS AND WE MOVE ON THAT'S WE'RE GOING TO ADD THE THIRD CLUB
gEA3qjf-3DM_13 0 SO SAY HERE PRACTICING RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT MAKE SURE YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR POSTURE THINK ABOUT YOUR THROWS THINK ABOUT THE SPIN A LOT OF THINGS TO KEEP TRACK OF I KNOW THE PRACTICE ENOUGH AND YOU'LL GET A CLEAN
gPPDoNCUEgM_1 0 SO I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TIME ON OR TECHNIQUE WHICH IS WHICH IS CALLED TRACING
gPPDoNCUEgM_2 0 AND THE WHOLE IDEA OF TRACING HAS TO DO WITH FIGURING OUT WHERE THINGS ARE GOING TO GO DECIDING HOW TO PUT THEM THEY'RE PUTTING THEM IN THE RIGHT PLACE
gPPDoNCUEgM_3 0 SO IN THIS CASE WHAT I'M AFTER IS A P THAT I WANT TO PUT RIGHT HERE SO THAT I END UP WITH PLACING AND SPACING
gPPDoNCUEgM_4 0 SO JUST HAPPENS TO HAVE A PITA OVER HERE THAT I HAVE DESIGN AND THIN SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO JUST TRACE OVER IT AND I CAN BE MAKING LITTLE ADJUSTMENTS ALONG THE WAY SAY I WANT TO CHANGE THAT SHAPE JUST A LITTLE TINY BIT
gPPDoNCUEgM_5 0 MAYBE I WANT TO MAKE THIS LONGER
gPPDoNCUEgM_6 0 IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU RUN INTO TO DO IN A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORK
gPPDoNCUEgM_7 0 AND I GUESS WHO'S RUSHING THE JOB
gPPDoNCUEgM_8 0 IN REAL LIFE YOU GOTTA GO SLOWER THAN THIS
gPPDoNCUEgM_9 0 NOW LET'S SAY THAT I DECIDE IF THAT'S JUST THE WAY I WANT IT
gPPDoNCUEgM_10 0 I WANT IT TO LOOK ABOUT LIKE THAT
gPPDoNCUEgM_12 0 SO I'M GOING TO WANT TO LOOK LIKE
gPPDoNCUEgM_13 0 NOW IN LIKE THAT
gPPDoNCUEgM_14 0 MAKE UP YOUR MIND
gPPDoNCUEgM_15 0 THINK ABOUT THIS
gPPDoNCUEgM_16 0 THINK ABOUT HOW THIS GOES IN THIS GOES
gPPDoNCUEgM_18 0 SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO FROM MY TRACE THIS I'VE GOT TO GET AND TRACE THE BACK
gxoXqMWJ8dY_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M ERIC WILLIAMS AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT READING MUSIC
gxoXqMWJ8dY_2 0 SO FOLLOWING UP WITH OUR DISCUSSION OF FLATS LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SHARPS
gxoXqMWJ8dY_3 0 IF WE MOVE TO THE NEXT MEASURE WE HAVE IN HALF AND WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE BASS CLEF AND THE BASS CLEF HAS THE DOT ABOVE AND BELOW THE STAFF LINE SO THAT'S A DEAD GIVE AWAY THAT THAT'S OUT IF YOU WANT TO TRY YOUR GOOD BOYS DO FINALIZE THAT WILL ALSO BRING IT TO HAVE ANYWAY HERE'S A HALF THE VERY NEXT NOTE IS IN HALF WITH A SHARP SYMBOL IN FRONT
gxoXqMWJ8dY_4 0 THAT MEANS TO RAISE THE ADD A HALF STEP HIGHER
gxoXqMWJ8dY_5 0 THEN THE VERY NEXT NOTE IS ALSO ONE HALF BUT WE HAVE THE NATURAL SIGN IN FRONT OF THE F SO I'LL BET BY NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHY THAT'S THERE AND LET ME TELL YOU ANYWAY
gxoXqMWJ8dY_6 0 THIS F SHARP WOULD NORMALLY IMPACT THIS F AND MAKE IT A SHARP ALSO BECAUSE THAT IS THE RULES OF ACCIDENTAL
gxoXqMWJ8dY_7 0 ACCIDENTALS BY THE WAY IS THE NAME FOR ALL THESE THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
gxoXqMWJ8dY_8 0 ACCIDENTALS INCORPORATE FLAT SYMBOLS SHARP CYMBALS AND NATURAL SONG
gxoXqMWJ8dY_9 0 SO THEN THE ACCIDENTAL ON THE F SHARP WOULD NORMALLY MAKE THIS AN F SHARP BUT SINCE WE DON'T IN THIS CASE WE DON'T WANT THAT TO BE SHARP WE HAVE TO USE THE NATURAL SIGN TO REALLY BE REDUCED THIS BACK TO REGULAR F SO WE HAVE F F SHARP F NATURAL
gxoXqMWJ8dY_10 0 AND AGAIN THE REASON WE DON'T HAVE A NATURAL SIGN IN FRONT OF THIS THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT IS JUST PLAIN F AND WE DON'T NEED TO HER NATURAL ON IT
gxoXqMWJ8dY_11 0 NOW WE'RE JUST CONFUSE PEOPLE AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT
gxoXqMWJ8dY_12 0 SO WE GOT F F SHARP AND F NATURAL BECAUSE ALL THIS IS ALREADY CONFUSING NOW
gxoXqMWJ8dY_13 0 HOPEFULLY THIS MAKES MORE SENSE
gxoXqMWJ8dY_14 0 THAT EXPLAINS FLATS AND SHARPS AND NATURAL

gd86ZcveJQY_1 0 HEY WELCOME BACK
gd86ZcveJQY_2 0 THIS BUTTON COURSE WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
gd86ZcveJQY_3 0 WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT HOW TO MAKE YOUR VIDEOS LOOK PROFESSIONAL
gd86ZcveJQY_4 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT LIGHTING
gd86ZcveJQY_5 0 LET ME SAY SOMETHING ABOUT DIGITAL VIDEO IN GENERAL
gd86ZcveJQY_6 0 IT IS VERY VERY CRUCIAL THAT YOU PAY ATTENTION TO LIGHTING
gd86ZcveJQY_7 0 ESPECIALLY LOW LIGHT LEVELS
gd86ZcveJQY_8 0 THEY DON'T DO VERY WELL
gd86ZcveJQY_9 0 EVEN SOME OF THE THINGS YOU'VE SEEN IN THEATERS SOME OF THESE DIGITAL MOVIES ESPECIALLY START WORSE WHICH IS ONE OF THE FIRST DIGITAL MOVIES SHOT AND ALL IN ALL VISUAL FORMAT THEY STILL IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH LIGHTING
gd86ZcveJQY_10 0 I THINK I MENTIONED BEFORE WHEN THE WHEN YOU HAVE DARK LEVELS OF BLACK AND GRAYS IT MAKES THE CAMERA WORK HARDER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT'S SCENE
gd86ZcveJQY_11 0 KEEP OF REALLY REALLY A CLOSE LOOK AT YOUR LIGHTING AND YOUR EXPOSURE LEVELS
gd86ZcveJQY_12 0 THAT MEANS YES YOU'LL HAVE TO INVEST IN LIGHTING KIT OF SOME SORT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY
gd86ZcveJQY_13 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY
gd86ZcveJQY_14 0 I HAVE TWO LIGHTS HERE I'VE HAD FOREVER
gd86ZcveJQY_15 0 AND IT ONLY COST ME A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS
gd86ZcveJQY_16 0 BASICALLY A YOU CAN CHOOSE WHATEVER KIND OF LIKE YOU WANT
gd86ZcveJQY_17 0 THESE ARE THE MOST BASICS WITH WHAT WE CALL BARN DOORS HERE AND THAT'S JUST SO THAT YOU CAN CONTROL ALT SOME OF THE LIGHT IN CERTAIN AREAS
gd86ZcveJQY_18 0 OBVIOUSLY WIDER MEANS A WIDER OF BRIGHT LIGHT AND THEN YOU CAN NARROW IT DOWN
gd86ZcveJQY_19 0 THERE'S ALSO YOU HAVE THE UMBRELLA HERE
gd86ZcveJQY_20 0 JUST PERFECT FOR DIFFUSE LIGHTING
gd86ZcveJQY_21 0 IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU'RE SHOOTING SOMEBODY NEVER POINT TO LIGHT DIRECTLY OUT THERE
gd86ZcveJQY_22 0 USUALLY POINTED UP BUT IF YOU WANT SOFT SO IT'S NOT SO HARD THE SHADOWS ARE HARD YOU SHOULD AVOID CHOSE ANYWAY BUT TO SOFTEN EVERYTHING USING GROWS
gd86ZcveJQY_23 0 ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO DO WHEN YOU'RE SHOOTING INDOORS IS TO USE A SINGLE LIGHT AS IF IT'S SUPER BRIGHT AND JUST SIMPLY POINTED BALANCE THE LIGHT OFF THE CEILING
gd86ZcveJQY_24 0 THAT'S HOW ON BEING TAKES RIGHT NOW
gd86ZcveJQY_25 0 AS A SINGLE LIGHT THAT IS POINTED UP AT THE CEILING AND THAT DIFFUSE THAT LIGHT BECAUSE CEILINGS WHITE AND GIVES IT A NICE GLOW
gd86ZcveJQY_26 0 IF YOU CAN DO WITH ONE LIGHT GRAY BUT TO LIGHT IS BETTER AND REALLY NICE PROFESSIONAL QUALITY IS THREE LIGHTS
gd86ZcveJQY_27 0 AND YOU USE ONE AS THE MAIN OF FILL IN AND SOMETIMES A SPOT
gd86ZcveJQY_28 0 BASICALLY THAT'S IT WITH LIGHTING WITHIN ONE OTHER ISSUE
gd86ZcveJQY_29 0 IF YOU CAN AFFORD THESE THAT'S OKAY
gd86ZcveJQY_30 0 I WOULD STILL IN IT ADVISE YOU TO INVEST IN SOME KIND OF LIGHTING
gd86ZcveJQY_31 0 MAYBE YOU CAN BUY THE KIND OF LIGHT THAT SITS ON TOP OF YOUR CAMCORDER IN YOUR SHOE AND YOU CAN MOUNT IT THERE
gd86ZcveJQY_32 0 ALWAYS PAY TENSIONER LIGHTING
gd86ZcveJQY_33 0 AND YOU CAN BUY IT LIKE THAT GOES ON TOP OF YOUR CAMERA A IF YOU CAN SUPPORT LIGHTS LIKE THIS THAT FITS IN THE SHOE
gd86ZcveJQY_34 0 PAY ATTENTION LINING CAUSE IT'S THE MOST CRUCIAL PART OF DIGITAL VIDEO
gd86ZcveJQY_35 0 NEXT LET'S LOOK AT HOW ALL THIS WORKS WITH YOUR COMPUTER
GmN2IFIkwv8_1 0 NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT OUR TONES
GmN2IFIkwv8_2 0 REMEMBER OKAY WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING THE BALL ALRIGHT MAY SHOW ALRIGHT THEN IN THAT GRIP IN IT
GmN2IFIkwv8_3 0 OKAY WHEN PLAYING THE VIOLIN YOU WANT TO BE IS RELAXED AS POSSIBLE
GmN2IFIkwv8_4 0 SEE HOW I'M ABLE TO DO THIS RIGHT HERE
GmN2IFIkwv8_5 0 YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME WITHIN TIME OKAY
GmN2IFIkwv8_6 0 SO LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT PUNCHING DOWN THE STRING
GmN2IFIkwv8_7 0 AND THERE'S NO SPACE IN BETWEEN THE WOOD AND THE HAIR IT MEANS SOMETHING GOES WRONG
GmN2IFIkwv8_8 0 YOUR SCRUNCHING DOWN TOO MUCH

GmN2IFIkwv8_13 0 SO WITH
GmN2IFIkwv8_14 0 GOOD
HjPS59Erxgw_1 0 WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT VALUES OF THE ORNAMENTS THAT I HAVE
HjPS59Erxgw_2 0 LIKE I SAID BEFORE IF YOU GET A REFERENCE BOOK YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH THESE ORNAMENTS ARE WORTH THIS YEAR
HjPS59Erxgw_3 0 THEY PRICES ARE GOING TO VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR
HjPS59Erxgw_4 0 SOME WILL INCREASE SEVERAL DECREASE
HjPS59Erxgw_5 0 BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY THESE ORNAMENTS ON THE SECONDARY MARKET OR USED ON THE YEAR THAT IT WASN'T PUT OUT IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO USE THIS IS A BASE WHEN YOU BUY YOUR ORNAMENTS
HjPS59Erxgw_6 0 YOU GOT A DAY YOU CAN FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH IT'S WORTH ANY COMPARE THAT TO WHAT PRICE THAT THEY ARE ASKING
HjPS59Erxgw_7 0 SOME OF THE EXAMPLES OF THE BEST INCREASE IN VALUE IS THE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE BETSEY CLARK FIRST SERIES
HjPS59Erxgw_8 0 THAT'S ALL FOR TWO THOUSAND FIFTY CENTS NEW
HjPS59Erxgw_9 0 IT'S NOW OR THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS
HjPS59Erxgw_10 0 THIS ONE WHICH IS THE VERY FIRST FROSTY FRIENDS ORNAMENT SOLD FOR SIX DOLLARS A YEAR THAT WAS RELEASED
HjPS59Erxgw_11 0 IT IS NOW OR A SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS AND THE FIRST THREE HOUSES OF THE SELJUK SERIES THOSE THREE HOUSES TOGETHER OUR SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE DOLLARS
gDGrAAY42rE_1 0 YOU WILL PROBABLY FIND YOURSELF AND COUNTERING SOME FRUSTRATION IN THE PRACTICE OF IN THIS PRACTICE
gDGrAAY42rE_2 0 THIS ISN'T GOING VERY WELL SORRY I'M OKAY NOW BUT THERE YOU GO IF THERE'S A PERFECT CIRCLE
gDGrAAY42rE_3 0 AND WITH THE USE OF THE DIVIDER LOOPS OTHER THINGS CAN HAPPEN LIKE LET'S SAY OH I WANT TO DO THIS SO NINE OR WHERE YOU WANT TO GO WITH THAT YOU CAN MARK THAT
gDGrAAY42rE_4 0 ANYWAY DIVIDER COMES IN HANDY WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE FIGURING OUT HOW TO MAKE YOUR CIRCLES WHAT SIZE FOR PROPORTIONS AND SO ON
gDGrAAY42rE_5 0 YOU SEE HOW TO CLEAN THIS
gDGrAAY42rE_6 0 ANOTHER WAY TO CLEAN THINGS YOU CAN DO THIS WITH THE HANDS AS WELL AS SO JUST TAKE A PIECE OF PAPER AND GO LIKE THIS OR SECOND OPEN THIS UP A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT THAT'S HOW YOU CLEAN THE INSIDE ALSO WITH THOSE PEOPLE PINS
gDGrAAY42rE_7 0 ANOTHER THING OH I SHOULD MENTIONED AS I THINK ABOUT IT IS TO HAVE THIS LITTLE JAR AND THIS IS ACTUALLY ALCOHOL SO I CAN USE THIS SOMETIMES TO CLEAN OFF MY PENS JUST HELPS AND MAYBE TO DO THIS ONCE IN AWHILE INSTEAD OF JUST USING PLAYING A WATER
gDGrAAY42rE_8 0 AND I ALSO USE TISSUES FOR CLEANING THINGS LIKE THIS AND THEN RIGHT HERE DIP IT IN WATER OR ALCOHOL AND I USE A TISSUE TO CLEAN IT OFF
gDGrAAY42rE_9 0 SO YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE REALLY KEEP YOUR TOOL IS VERY KEEP THE TOOLS CLEAN

HAjRnO19Pds_8 0 KEEPING OUR BREAKS HIGH USING THE THROTTLE TO SLOWER DESCENT RATE
HAjRnO19Pds_9 0 AND AS SOON AS OUR REAR WHEELS TOUCH THE GROUND YOU WANT TO LET OFF ON THE THROTTLE AND GO AHEAD AND KILL THE MOTOR AS WE BRING OUR HANDS SLOWLY AND PROGRESSIVELY DOWN AND INTO THE LANDING
HAjRnO19Pds_10 0 THE OTHER THING WE CAN DO WITH A POWER LANDING IS AS SOON AS WE LAND YOU MAY USE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BRAKE WILL COMBINATION OF BRAKE AND THROTTLE
HAjRnO19Pds_11 0 AS SOON AS WE'RE ON THE GROUND WE CAN GO SHIFT OUR EYES FROM LOOKING AT THE HORIZON THE RUNWAY TO OUR MIRROR FOCUS ON TAXING ALONG WITH THAT WING
HAjRnO19Pds_12 0 IF IT'S BALANCED UNSTABLE YOU CAN GO RIGHT BACK INTO ANOTHER LAUNCH
HAjRnO19Pds_13 0 SO WE CAN DO THESE TOUCHING GO PRACTICE RUNS REALLY GOOD EXERCISE FOR THAT

GI3mKlEwDr8_25 0 SO THEY LEAVE THEM
GI3mKlEwDr8_26 0 WE WANT TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH THE PERSON

GsgXatk8ayI_2 0 HERE WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF A CARD WITH KICKER THIS IS CALLED DRUM IS PAT
GsgXatk8ayI_3 0 NORMALLY COSTS ONE COLORLESS INTO BLUE BUT WITH THE KICK IT COST OF TWO COLORLESS AND ONE BLACK IT THE TOTAL COST BECOMES SIX TO BLUE ONE BLACK AND THREE COLORLESS
GsgXatk8ayI_4 0 THE THE ADDITIONAL KICKER COST IS THAT YOU DISCARD A CREATURE CARD FROM YOUR HAND

GsgXatk8ayI_6 0 SO IF YOU FOR INSTANCE DISCARDED FROG MIGHT AND PAID SIX FOR THE CREATURE IT WOULD BE A FOUR FOUR FLYING RATHER THAN JUST THE TWO TWO
GsgXatk8ayI_7 0 THE KICKER COST MUST BE ANNOUNCED DURING THE PLAYING OF THE SPELLER ABILITY WHEN YOU WOULD THAT ANNOUNCE ADDITIONAL COST IS WHEN YOU CHOOSE YOUR MODE AND DECIDE WHAT AXIS

h4eS2jw8DA8_2 0 AND NOW I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS IN SOME OF THE NOT SO WONDERFUL THINGS AS FAR AS BEING A PHARMACIST GOES
h4eS2jw8DA8_3 0 GREAT THINGS ARE YOU GET TO WORK WITH PEOPLE
h4eS2jw8DA8_4 0 ONE OF THE BEST THINGS IS YOU GET TO WORK WITH PEOPLE
h4eS2jw8DA8_5 0 ONE THAT THAT CAN BE A PLUS AN A MINUS
h4eS2jw8DA8_6 0 SOME A LOT OF PEOPLE WE DEAL WITH THEIR SICK THEY DON'T FEEL WELL THEY'RE NOT VERY HAPPY ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR PRESCRIPTIONS AS FAR AS ENTRANCE REIMBURSEMENT RATES GOES
h4eS2jw8DA8_7 0 SO THAT CAN BE DIFFICULT THING BUT IT'S ALSO WONDERFUL THING BECAUSE YOU GET TO BUILD A RELATIONSHIP WITH PEOPLE
h4eS2jw8DA8_8 0 ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITY PHARMACY WHETHER YOU'RE IN A CHAIN OR AN INDEPENDENT OR THAT TYPE OF SETTING
h4eS2jw8DA8_9 0 YOU REALLY GET TO KNOW PEOPLE AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THEIR MEDICINE OVER TIME
h4eS2jw8DA8_10 0 THAT'S A REALLY NEAT FEELING
h4eS2jw8DA8_11 0 YOU REALLY BECOME A PART OF THE COMMUNITY AS THEY'RE PHARMACISTS
h4eS2jw8DA8_12 0 ANOTHER GREAT THING ABOUT BEING A PHARMACIST IS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO SET THEIR SCHEDULES FAIRLY NICELY
h4eS2jw8DA8_13 0 THERE'S A LOT OF PART-TIME WORK AVAILABLE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE APPRECIATE THAT
h4eS2jw8DA8_14 0 THEY ARE ABLE TO REALLY PURSUE THERE A INTERESTS AND ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE OF WORK AND THE PHARMACY CAREER ALLOWS FOR THAT QUITE NICELY
h4eS2jw8DA8_15 0 IN OTHER KINDS OF I WOULD SAY INSURANCE HIS ICON
h4eS2jw8DA8_16 0 THAT'S NOT A WONDERFUL THING TO DEAL WITH
h4eS2jw8DA8_17 0 IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE ALWAYS STRUGGLING AND IT'S AN UPHILL BATTLE TO TRY AND GET PEOPLE WHAT THEY NEED AND THE THAT CAN KIND OF DRAG IT DOWN SOME DAYS
h4eS2jw8DA8_18 0 AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS WORK LOAD
h4eS2jw8DA8_19 0 THAT WOULD BE A CON
h4eS2jw8DA8_20 0 IT TURNS OUT THAT MORE MORE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY WITH THE BABY BOOMERS COMING ON OUR KNEADING MEDICATIONS

GCz6XNWe8k4_16 0 I WANT TO KEEP A NICE NEUTRAL SPINE AND THEN STEP BACK
GCz6XNWe8k4_17 0 NOW YOU CAN ALTERNATE SIDES OR YOU CAN DO ALL ON ONE SIDE LIKE I'M DOING NOW
GCz6XNWe8k4_18 0 SAME THINGS AS ANY OTHER LINES JUST WE'RE STEPPING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION USING OUR ARMS FOR BALANCE
GCz6XNWe8k4_19 0 TOUGHER TO ADD WEIGHTS TO THIS ONE
GCz6XNWe8k4_20 0 CAN BE DONE
GCz6XNWe8k4_21 0 BARBELL ACROSS THE BACK
GCz6XNWe8k4_22 0 DUMBBELLS DON'T REALLY WORK TOO WELL BECAUSE OUR LEGS IN THE WAY

h8alXw0uBc8_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE DECORATING THE STRIPS WITH THE WITH THE MATCH STICKS
h8alXw0uBc8_3 0 THEY'RE NOT REAL MATCHES OF COURSE BUT THEY'RE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AND IT'S THE THE THE STICK PART OF THE MATCHES AND THEY'VE BEEN COLORED
h8alXw0uBc8_4 0 WE HAVE A LOT OF USUALLY WHEN YOU BUY THEM IN A IN A BIG PACKAGE OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT COLORS
h8alXw0uBc8_5 0 WHAT WE DO THIS IS WE TAKE THE ENTIRE FACE OF THE STRIP AND COVER WITH GLUE
h8alXw0uBc8_6 0 DEPENDING ON WHICH AGE OF KIDS AND HOW YOU WANT TO WORK THE PROJECT YOU CAN USE A PAINT BRUSH OR YOU CAN HAVE THEM SMEAR THE GLUE WITH THE FINGER
h8alXw0uBc8_7 0 AND ONCE IT'S COVER THE WHOLE SURFACE OF THE STRIP WE'RE GOING TO LAY THE MATCH STICKS RIGHT ON TOP
h8alXw0uBc8_8 0 NOW THE MATCH STICKS DON'T NEED TO BE TRIMMED EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT BE NOT BE THE EXACT SAME SIZE BUT IF WE THE MEASUREMENTS THAT WE GAVE WHEN CUTTING THE STRIPS SHOULD BE A NICE FIT FOR THE MATCH STICKS
h8alXw0uBc8_9 0 AND YOU CAN JUST LAY THEM IN ANY COLOR PATTERN THAT YOU WANT
h8alXw0uBc8_10 0 OF COURSE THERE'S NO THERE'S A NO SET WAY TO DECORATE THE STRIPS THAT ARE GOING TO BE THE ARMS OF THE WINDMILL BUT I THINK IT WOULD READ THAT ONCE YOU SEE THE THE FINISHED PROJECT THAT THE MATCH STICKS WAS A REALLY NICE COLORFUL CREATIVE WAY TO DECORATE THE WINDMILL
h8alXw0uBc8_11 0 IT GIVES A REALLY NICE NICE LOOK AND IT'S A LOT OF FUN FOR KIDS
h8alXw0uBc8_12 0 THEY IT'S AN EASY WAY FOR THEM TO USE THEIR CREATIVE TALENTS TO PICK COLORS AND DECORATE THE ARMS OF THE WINDMILL AND THEY ALWAYS LIKE WORKING WITH GLUE
h8alXw0uBc8_13 0 IT'S ALSO A NICE TO USE THE MATCH STICKS BECAUSE IN THE END WHEN THEY'RE ALL SITTING ON TOP OF THE CORRUGATED STRIPS YOU CAN PUT THEM NICE AND STRAIGHT AND EVEN ON THE EDGES
h8alXw0uBc8_14 0 THEY USUALLY PRETTY EVEN SIZED ONE ONCE OF THE WAY THAT WE BUY THEM
h8alXw0uBc8_15 0 SO ALSO THAT GIVES A NICE CLEAN CUT LOOK TO OUR WINDMILL INSTEAD OF USING ANY OTHER TYPE OF DECORATIONS THAT MIGHT LOOK VERY HODGEPODGE
h8alXw0uBc8_16 0 THIS GIVES A NICE CLEAN SYMMETRICAL LOOK WHEN WE PUT ALL THE MATCH STICKS IN PLACE AND MAKE THEM NICE AND EVEN SITTING ON THE CORRUGATED BOX
h8alXw0uBc8_17 0 SO IT'S ALSO AN ADDED LOOK SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE CHOOSING A WAY TO DECORATE THE STRIPS OF YOUR OF YOUR WINDMILL

gNXh0ajoI1A_1 0 IT WOULD TAKE EACH BEFORE RUNNING A MARATHON
gNXh0ajoI1A_2 0 THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO BE OUT THERE FOR TWENTY SIX POINTS TO MOLDS AND YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE PROPER NUTRITION OUT FOR OUT FOR RUNNING SUCH A LONG DISTANCE
gNXh0ajoI1A_3 0 SO THAT'S A PROCESS THAT IS CALLED OUT CARPAL LOADING AND A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE MARATHON YOU REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON THE MOSTLY FOODS THAT ARE HOIUM CARBOHYDRATES
gNXh0ajoI1A_4 0 SO THE CARBOHYDRATES TURN INTO WHAT IS CALLED THE POOL COATS
gNXh0ajoI1A_5 0 GLUCOSE IS A KIND OF SUGAR THAT GIVES YOU THE ENERGY THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO HELP SUSTAIN YOU OVER A TWENTY SIX MOUL RATES
gNXh0ajoI1A_6 0 BUT IN ADDITION TO STAY PROBABILITY SAY TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE THE ACTUAL MARATHON HOW YOU ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE GETTING A NOTE ON THE LIQUID TEN THAT YOUR HYDRATING WELL
gNXh0ajoI1A_7 0 SO IF YOU'RE RUNNING A MARATHON WE KNOW THAT WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE VERY VERY HOT IS GOING TO BE VERY VERY HUMID YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR WELL HYDRATED THAT ONLY WITH WATER BUT ALSO SOME KIND OF THE NATURAL LIGHT TRAIN
gNXh0ajoI1A_8 0 AND THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF BY GETTING TWO TRICKS THAT ARE ON THE MARKET TODAY
gNXh0ajoI1A_9 0 AND EVEN ENJOY THE MARATHON AT THE VOLUNTEER A STATIONS ALONG THE COURSE THERE ARE VOLUNTEERS DOWN HERE YOU ARE GETTING THE RUNNER IS THESE TYPES OF THE NATURAL LIGHT WHICH YOU'LL GET HIM THROUGH THE MARATHON
gNXh0ajoI1A_10 0 SO THE MORNING OF YOUR MARATHON YOU'RE EXCITED YOU'RE READY TO GO YOU'RE READY TO RUN BUT YOU'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING
gNXh0ajoI1A_11 0 SO IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE DOT I'VE CARBOHYDRATE A WET RICH CARBOHYDRATES OF PASTA POTATOES TO THIS BEFORE AND THE MORNING UP THE MARATHON I USUALLY EAT MAYBE LIKE A TOWEL BAR A BANANA OR THEY GO GET IN SOME MORE LIQUIDS
gNXh0ajoI1A_12 0 I DON'T NORMALLY YOU LET GO MARCH PRACTICE BECAUSE THAT A LITTLE THING THAT'S GOING TO PERSONALLY BENEFITS MEAT BUT FOR SOME OTHER RUNNERS BEFORE THEY HAVE TO EAT A BREAKFAST A WITH FOOD FOOD WITH A BIT MORE SUBSTANCE SLEEPING OATMEAL BREAKFAST SOMETHING LIKE THAT
gNXh0ajoI1A_13 0 I FIND MY EXPERIENCE THAT MAYBE A BANANA OR A POWER BAR ALONG WITH SOME EXTRA OUR WATER OR A LETTER MY TRAINS TEND TO HIGH GET YOU READY FOR IT FOR MY MARATHON DISTANCE
gNXh0ajoI1A_14 0 AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL LACE TERMS OF HOW MUCH TO EAT THE MORNING OF THE MARATHON
GP8PBhO7sHY_1 0 HOW MANY TIMES THAT THEY DO YOU THINK TO STRETCH YOUR TOES
GP8PBhO7sHY_3 0 I'M CINDY MASTRY
GP8PBhO7sHY_4 0 WE SPEND A LOT OF TIMES STRETCHING ALL THE OTHER PARTS OF OUR BODIES BUT WE FORGET ABOUT OUR FEET
GP8PBhO7sHY_5 0 AND OUR FEET ARE THE VERY FOUNDATION THE VERY GROUNDING TO THE EARTH
GP8PBhO7sHY_6 0 WHAT HAPPENS IS BLANKETS POOL DOWN INTO OUR FEET AND TOES AND IT GETS STUCK THERE AND IT GETS STAGNANT
GP8PBhO7sHY_7 0 SO A REALLY GOOD WAY TO STRETCH YOUR TOES AND FLUSH ALL THE STAGNANT BLOOD OUT OF YOUR TOES IS TO USE HERO POSE BUT THE SIT ON YOUR TOES
GP8PBhO7sHY_8 0 SO I'M GOING TO COME OVER UNDER MY KNEES AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO SPREAD MY TOES AS WIDE AS I CAN AND JUST SIT BACK ON MY HEELS ADDING A LITTLE PRESSURE
GP8PBhO7sHY_9 0 IF YOU'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE THIS IS GOING TO FEEL PRETTY INTENSE
GP8PBhO7sHY_10 0 SO YOU MIGHT NEED TO JUST START OUT WITH JUST A FEW SECONDS AND THEN THE NEXT THEY DO A FEW MORE SECONDS
GP8PBhO7sHY_11 0 BUT WHAT THIS IS DOING YOUR SPREADING YOUR TOES GETTING THOSE MUSCLES TO START BEING ACTIVATED AGAIN BECAUSE THEY LOSE THEIR THEIR ABILITY TO MOVE WE CREMA INTO SHOES AND FLUSHING ALL THAT STAGNANT BLOOD OUT OF THE TOES THIS PUSHES IT RIGHT BACK UP INTO YOUR LEGS
GP8PBhO7sHY_12 0 SO THIS IS A REALLY GREAT WAY TO STRETCH YOUR TOES WIRE IN HERO POSE

gJR9CuXLjIw_9 0 NOW I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT ON THIS PIECE IS SOMEONE ELSE'S PIECE THAT THEY'RE WORKING ON THAT IT WOULD TURN THIS BLACK AND AS YOU GO AHEAD AND PLACE YOUR PATINA UP ON YOUR SOLDER AND IT ALSO HAVE A HAIR DRYER AVAILABLE TO HEAT UP THE PATINA ON YOUR SOLDER OR YOUR SINK OR YOUR LEAD WHICH EVER USING IT ON TO IT

GPj4NmEDoHE_1 0 TYPES OF THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH A PUPPY AS FAR AS GETTING THEM COMPLETELY HAMSTRING
GPj4NmEDoHE_2 0 IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY AND SO YOU'VE GOT TO USE PATIENTS AND KIND OF STICK IN THERE
GPj4NmEDoHE_3 0 IT CAN TAKE QUITE SOME TIME AND BE REALISTIC ABOUT IT
GPj4NmEDoHE_4 0 THESE GUYS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE REALLY YOUN CANNOT LEARN HOUSE TRAINING OVERNIGHT
GPj4NmEDoHE_5 0 IT CAN TAKE DAYS TWO WEEKS SOMETIMES FOR THESE GUYS TO FIGURE IT OUT
GPj4NmEDoHE_6 0 THE FIRST THING I USUALLY IT'S EASY TO DO WHEN TRYING TO HOUSE TRAINER PUPPY IS GET THEM TO RECOGNIZE WHAT THEY CAN GO ON IN THE HOUSEHOLD LIKE EVERYDAY NEWSPAPER WORKS VERY WELL
GPj4NmEDoHE_7 0 THEY ALSO SELL PP PADS AT PET STORES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
GPj4NmEDoHE_8 0 SO BECAUSE THESE IT WITH A REALLY YOUNG THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE GOING TO IMMEDIATELY START GOING OUTSIDE AND SO IF THEY ARE GOING INSIDE AND GET THEM TO TRY TO GO ON A NEWSPAPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
GPj4NmEDoHE_9 0 IF THEY DESICCATE TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT AND PUT IT ON NEWSPAPER OR GET A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR AND PUT ON THERE IF YOU CAN SOCAL YOUR IT ONTO THE NEWSPAPER AND THEN THEY'LL GET THAT SAND AND START FIGURING THAT OUT
GPj4NmEDoHE_10 0 THE FIRST OTHER THE SECOND OTHER THING YOU NEED TO DO THEN IS STARTS RIGHT GETTING THEM TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUTSIDE AS WHERE THEY NEED TO GO
GPj4NmEDoHE_11 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO USE NEWSPAPER FOR VERY LONG BECAUSE THAT CONFUSES THAT MAKES AND THINK OH IT'S OKAY TO GO INSIDE
GPj4NmEDoHE_12 0 YOU CAN START MOVING THE PAPER OUTSIDE OR ONE EASY THING TO DO IS ALWAYS TAKE A LITTLE TREAT WITH YOU OUTSIDE AND THEN JUST PLAY WITH THEM OUT THERE WHEN THEY DO GO YOU WANT TO PRAISE THEM AND YOU WANT TO TREAT THEM IMMEDIATELY RIGHT WHEN THEY GO BECAUSE YOU WANT TO ASSOCIATE THAT WITH SOMETHING REALLY POSITIVE
GPj4NmEDoHE_13 0 IF THEY GO ON THE INSIDE OF THE HOUSE YOU CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING EXCEPT IF YOU'RE CATCHING THEM RIGHT THERE JUST LET THEM KNOW NO AND LET THEM KNOW THAT THAT'S A NEGATIVE THING TO DO
GPj4NmEDoHE_14 0 AND SO IT TAKES A WHILE BUT KEEP IN THEIR KNEES POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT ESPECIALLY OUTSIDE AND THEY WILL ARE

HbPH54fD5y8_4 0 WHEN THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING DOWN ON PAPER AND THERE'S NOTHING BUT YOUR IDEAS IN YOUR HEAD AND YOUR STARING AT THE PAGE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE YOUR IDEAS ARE REALITY OR MAYBE YOU JUST FEEL LIKE BUFFING AROUND AND YOU KNOW THE STITCHING SEEING WHAT IDEAS FLOW FROM THE TIP OF YOUR PEN ON THE PAGE
HbPH54fD5y8_5 0 SO IN THIS INSTANCE OF THE FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS CHOOSE A TYPE OF PEN THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE SKETCHING WITH
HbPH54fD5y8_6 0 IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO BE USING THE FINE TIPPED SHARPIE WHICH IS NO GOOD FOR THESE TYPES OF DEMONSTRATIONS CAUSE YOU CAN REALLY SEE THE INK PRETTY WELL BUT I WILL TELL YOU THE IF YOU'RE USING A SKETCH PAD THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF PRECIOUS DRAWINGS ON PROBABLY GOOD IDEA TO USE SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT LESS POWERFUL BECAUSE THIS ONE BLEED LIKE CRAZY THROUGH THE PAGES
HbPH54fD5y8_7 0 SO EITHER MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A SAFETY PAGE BLOCKING THE CURRENT PAGER DRAWING ON FROM THE OTHER PAGES OR USE A PEN IT'S NOT QUITE AS CRAZY POWERFUL
HbPH54fD5y8_8 0 THIS IS ONE OF USING FOR THE DEMONSTRATION
HbPH54fD5y8_9 0 HOWEVER MOST FOLKS WE'RE SKETCHING EARLY IDEAS OUT PREFER TO GO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT LESS PERMANENT LIKE A PENCIL WITH AN ERASER
HbPH54fD5y8_10 0 ERASER OBVIOUSLY CAN HELP YOU CHANGE THE LITTLE MISTAKES THAT YOU'RE BOUND TO MAKE IS YOUR CRAFT IN YOUR IDEA AND THEN SOME FOLKS MORE PROFESSIONAL FOLKS OR A LITTLE LESS AFRAID OF MISTAKE MAKING MISTAKES GO FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE FINE TIP

HdDPAe23QK8_1 0 ANOTHER THING THAT SOMETIMES WORKS WITH DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR STUDENTS IS TO PUT THEM IN GROUPS
HdDPAe23QK8_2 0 HAVE STUDENTS WORK IN GROUPS AND IF YOU HAVE A CLUSTER OF STUDENTS TO TEND TO BE DISRUPTIVE YOU DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT THEM WORKING TOGETHER AT OR MAYBE YOU DEFINITELY DO AND I'LL TELL YOU THE TWO REASONS WHY
HdDPAe23QK8_3 0 IF YOU SPLIT THEM UP AND YOU ASSIGNED GROUPS AROUND THE CLASS AND YOU SPLIT THE DISRUPTIVE STUDENTS
HdDPAe23QK8_4 0 THOSE STUDENTS HAVE TO HAVE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY IN THEIR NEW GROUP
HdDPAe23QK8_5 0 THE NEW GROUP MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT THEIR LITTLE BUDDIES IN THE CLASS WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO PARTICIPATE
HdDPAe23QK8_6 0 ENCOURAGE THEM NOT TO BE DISRUPTIVE
HdDPAe23QK8_7 0 ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO GOOD WORK BECAUSE THAT'S THE STANDARD OF THE GROUP OR YOU CAN TAKE A DIFFERENT TACTIC AND YOU CAN LET ALL DISRUPTIVE STUDENTS WORK TOGETHER AND IF THERE'S A TIME LIMIT ON THE ACTIVITY NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN THEY WON'T MAKE IT SO EVERY OTHER GROUP GETS AN A BECAUSE THEY WERE DOING THEIR WORK AND THE DISRUPTIVE GROUP GETS A D BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T PREPARED AND SO THAT IS ALWAYS AN OPTION IS TO PLACE THEM INTO GROUPS

gEtTXn_UJQg_1 0 HI I'M CHRIS FAIRCLOTH ARTISTIC DIRECTOR AND <UNK> OF SALON TEEZ
gEtTXn_UJQg_2 0 FOR EXPERT VILLAGE THIS IS HOW TO TRIM WOMEN'S HAIR
gEtTXn_UJQg_3 0 WE'LL BE USING A HORIZONTAL TYPE OF SECTIONING FOR THIS
gEtTXn_UJQg_4 0 JUST FROM THE TOP OF THE EAR ARE ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE EAR TO CREATE A STRAIGHT LINE IS COMING STRAIGHT ACROSS AND THIS GIVES THIS ARE HORIZONTAL SECTION
gEtTXn_UJQg_5 0 NOTICE MY FINGER ANGLE IS MORE IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION
gEtTXn_UJQg_6 0 IT MIRRORS THE SECTION THAT I JUST
gEtTXn_UJQg_7 0 BUT NOW BE USING A PUMP THE PALM CUTTING METHOD
gEtTXn_UJQg_8 0 THE REASON I WANT TO DO THIS IS IT KEEPS MY THUMB JUST SLIGHTLY IN THE THUMB HOLE AND IT ALLOWS ME NOT TO BEND MY WRIST SO THAT OUR WRIST BECOMES UNSTABLE OF A THUMB FITS ALL THE WAY INTO THE THUMB WHOLE CREATE MORE OF A QUACK EMOTION
gEtTXn_UJQg_9 0 SO BY CUTTING PUMP THE PALM OF ABLE JUST TO KIND OF THE BLADE THAT I NEED TO USE
gEtTXn_UJQg_10 0 CUTTING POMPOM MY CUTTING BLADE IS ACTUALLY ON TOP USING VERY LITTLE TENSION AND JUST LIGHTLY TRIMMING THE HAIR OFF
gEtTXn_UJQg_11 0 NOW WE'VE GOT A NICE CLEAN LINE
gEtTXn_UJQg_12 0 MOVE OVER TO THE NEXT SECTION IN MIRROR THE LINE THAT I CREATED ON THE RIGHT SIDE FOR THE LEFT SIDE
gEtTXn_UJQg_13 0 IT'S IMPORTANT THAT MY BODY POSITION IS IN FRONT OF THE HAIR THAT I'M ACTUALLY CUTTING
gEtTXn_UJQg_14 0 STANDING TO THE LEFT FOR STANDING TO THE RIGHT MIGHT ACTUALLY INCREASE MY FINGER ANGLE OR GIVE ME MORE OF A SHORT TO LONG OR ALONG THE SHORT TYPE OF EFFECT
gEtTXn_UJQg_15 0 I DON'T NEED TO TAKE THAT WHOLE PIECE SO WHAT I'LL DO IS ACTUALLY SET SECTION THAT SECTION SO THAT I CAN SEE WHERE MY GUIDE IS IN LINE THAT UP
gEtTXn_UJQg_16 0 LIKE I WILL ACTUALLY SLIP JUST SLIGHTLY THROUGH MY FINGERS AND I'LL BE ABLE TO GET THAT HERE ON THE LEFT SIDE
gEtTXn_UJQg_17 0 SINCE I'M RIGHT HANDED AND I WORK RIGHT TO LEFT I GO BACK TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND CREATE ANOTHER HORIZONTAL LINE SO SECTIONING MY RIGHT BACK SECTION
gEtTXn_UJQg_18 0 IF YOUR LEFT HAND OR YOU MAY WANT TO START ON THE LEFT SIDE AS IT'S PROBABLY EASIER TO WORK LEFT TO RIGHT FOR YOU GUESS
gEtTXn_UJQg_19 0 PLACE MY COMB IN THE SIDE OF THE HEAD OR THE SIDE BACK OF THE HEAD AND SEE WHERE THE COMB STARTS TO COME OFF OF THE HEAD FORM
gEtTXn_UJQg_20 0 THERE I'LL VISUALLY SEE WHAT I NEED TO CREATE THE NEXT SECTION AND JUST SLIGHTLY PLACEMENT COMB AND BRING THAT OVER SO THAT I CREATE MY HORIZONTAL LINE HERE AS WELL
gEtTXn_UJQg_21 0 I'LL CAN LIFT THE HAIR UP AND SEE THAT MY GUIDE IS OTHER PREVIOUSLY CAN'T HEAR IS RIGHT UNDERNEATH THAT
gEtTXn_UJQg_22 0 I WANT TO HAVE THAT DOES SLIT SLIGHTLY INTO MY FINGERS AND NOW CUTTING POMPOM AGAIN CUT THE HAIR THAT HANGS DOWN
gEtTXn_UJQg_23 0 BECAUSE THE TOP SECTION IS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN THE TWO SECTIONS THAT WE HAD IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD I CAN JUST COMPLETELY DROP THIS SECTION DOWN AND COMB THE HAIR AND ITS NATURAL FALL
gEtTXn_UJQg_24 0 THIS HERE IT WON'T NECESSARILY COME ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK SO JUST COME AND ITS NATURAL FALL
gEtTXn_UJQg_25 0 THIS WAY IT PREVENTS ANY SHORT TO LONG OR LONG TO SHORE
gEtTXn_UJQg_26 0 AGAIN A SIMILAR MY GUIDE IS SIMPLY LET THAT SLIP BETWEEN MY FINGERS AND NOW WE'VE TOTALLY CUT THE BACK AND JUST TRIM THAT WHERE WE HAVE A NICE HARD EDGE ARE NICE HARD PERIMETER LINE BLUNT LIME FOR THE BACK OF THE HEAD

grspb1X5oRI_1 0 HI THIS IS GINNY WITH SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL CRAFTS ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
grspb1X5oRI_2 0 ONE OF THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN DECORATE YOUR RAIN STICK IS TO USE CRAFT
grspb1X5oRI_3 0 IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE LINES THAT ARE LEFT BEHIND FROM THE PAPER TOWEL OR FROM WHATEVER TUBE YOU'RE USING THAT YOU WANT TO KEEP IT TO THE NATURAL COLOR CRAFT PAPER IS A GREAT CHOICE
grspb1X5oRI_4 0 YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF OPTIONS
grspb1X5oRI_5 0 YOU CAN COVER YOUR TWO WITH THE CRAFT PAPER FIRST AND THEN PAINT AND DECORATE ON THE CRAFT PAPER
grspb1X5oRI_6 0 OR YOU CAN DECORATE THE CRAFT PAPER BEFORE YOU PUT IT ON THE TWO
grspb1X5oRI_7 0 THAT'S WHAT I WOULD RATHER DO
grspb1X5oRI_8 0 SO YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR CRAFT PAPER
grspb1X5oRI_9 0 PUT YOUR TUBE IN IT
grspb1X5oRI_10 0 ROLL IT OUT SO THAT IT COMES TO THE EDGE AND THEN GIVE YOURSELF JUST A LITTLE BIT BE ON THE EDGE SO THAT YOU HAVE AN OVERLAP
grspb1X5oRI_12 0 AND THEN SO THAT YOUR EDGES WILL BE NICE AND STRAIGHT ROLL IT OUT A LITTLE MORE
grspb1X5oRI_13 0 FOLD IT UP THE MARK
grspb1X5oRI_14 0 KEEPING YOUR EDGE STRAIGHT MAKE A NICE CREASE
grspb1X5oRI_15 0 RECAP YOUR PINS SO IT DOESN'T ROUND OF INK OR DRY OUT
grspb1X5oRI_16 0 AND CUT YOUR CRAFT PAPER AND WE HOW HOT
grspb1X5oRI_17 0 ONCE YOUR PAPER IS CUT THAT WAY AND YOU WANT TO CUT IT THE LENGTH THAT YOU WANT FOR YOUR TUBE
grspb1X5oRI_18 0 IF YOU HAVE BOTH ENDS OF YOUR TUBE SECURE YOU WANT YOUR CRAFT PAPER PROBABLY TO GO ALL THE WAY TO BOTH HANDS
grspb1X5oRI_19 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE SAME THING
grspb1X5oRI_20 0 YOU'RE GOING TO MARK SLIGHTLY ON THE INSIDE TO SLIGHTLY ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR TUBE SO THAT IT DOESN'T OVERLAP
grspb1X5oRI_21 0 FOLD IT AND CUT IT
grspb1X5oRI_22 0 AND NOW YOU'RE READY TO DECORATE IT
grspb1X5oRI_23 0 AS I SAID THEY'RE ONE OF TWO WAYS YOU CAN DO THIS
grspb1X5oRI_24 0 YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND GLUE IT ONTO YOUR TWO BEFORE YOU DECORATE IT AND DECORATE IT ONCE YOU'RE ON YOUR TUBE
grspb1X5oRI_25 0 OR YOU CAN LAY IT FLAT AND TAKE YOUR PAINTS AND MAKE YOUR DESIGNS ON YOUR CRAFT PAPER BEFORE YOU PUT IT ON YOUR TUBE
grspb1X5oRI_26 0 FOR ME THAT SEEMS TO BE A SIMPLER WAY TO DO IT BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT TO WORK ON YOUR TWO
grspb1X5oRI_27 0 THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO
grspb1X5oRI_28 0 YOU CAN USE CRAYONS
grspb1X5oRI_29 0 YOU CAN USE PAINT
grspb1X5oRI_30 0 YOU CAN USE MARKERS
grspb1X5oRI_31 0 AND YOU CAN JUST SIMPLY MAKE LINES OR DESIGNS
grspb1X5oRI_32 0 WHATEVER YOU WOULD LIKE
grspb1X5oRI_33 0 YOU MIGHT EVEN TAKE A SPONGE AND PUT IT IN YOUR PAINT AND MAKE SPONGE DESIGNS
grspb1X5oRI_34 0 WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED YOU WANT TO COVER YOUR TUBE WITH CRAFT GLUE
grspb1X5oRI_35 0 WRAP YOUR CRAFT PAPER AROUND IT
grspb1X5oRI_36 0 USE A COUPLE OF THOSE RUBBER BANDS TO SECURE IT
grspb1X5oRI_37 0 AND WAIT UNTIL IT'S DRY
grspb1X5oRI_38 0 IF YOUR PAINT IF YOU'VE PAINTED IT IN YOUR RUBBER BANDS WOULD INTERFERE JUST PUT ON SOME PAPER CLIPS
gMLscPBaw2M_1 0 ABDOMINAL CRUNCH ON THE BALL
gMLscPBaw2M_2 0 NOW WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH CRUNCHES BUT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A TECHNIQUE THAT'S GOING TO KEEP YOUR NECK FROM INJURY FROM HERDING AND IT'S ALSO GOING TO HELP STRENGTHENING YOUR NECK AS YOU'RE DOING THE AB EXERCISES
gMLscPBaw2M_3 0 BECAUSE WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS THAT THEY HAVE PROBABLY ANIME BAD AS BECAUSE THEIR NECK SO WEAKER THEN THEIR ABS ARE AND THAT'S WHY THEY MAKE HURTS WHEN THEY'RE DOING THE ABDOMINAL CRUNCHES
gMLscPBaw2M_4 0 SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS WHEN YOU'RE HAVING A BALL OF YOUR SIZE MAKING SURE THAT THE THIGHS ARE PARALLEL TO THE FLOOR YOU'RE GOING TO ROLL INTO IT UNTIL THE HEAD IS PARALLEL TO THE FLOOR SO YOU HAVE THAT SUPPORT IT'S LIKE A PILLOW UNDER YOU
gMLscPBaw2M_5 0 KEEP YOUR FEET HIP WIDTH APART YOUR HEELS ARE UNDERNEATH YOUR NICE AND EVEN THAT OUT HERE AND YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP YOUR HIPS UP
gMLscPBaw2M_6 0 YOU LOOK LIKE A TABLE TOP
gMLscPBaw2M_7 0 NOW THE PROPER WAY TO DO EIGHT AN ABDOMINAL CRUNCH IS NOT LIFTING THE HEAD A ROLLING THE HEAD
gMLscPBaw2M_8 0 SO I SAY EXCEL I'M GOING TO BRING THE CHIN INTO THE CHEST AND THEN LIFT
gMLscPBaw2M_9 0 I'M GOING TO KEEP THE TONGUE AND THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH TO TO ACTIVATE THE FLEXORS AND THE EXTENSORS OF THE NECK
gMLscPBaw2M_10 0 SO I'M GOING TO BE QUITE AS I CAN KEEP THE MOUTH THE TONGUE AND THAT WILL FROM MY MOUTH
gMLscPBaw2M_11 0 OR IF YOU NOTICE I'M INHALING DOWN AND YOU CAN HEAR MY EXHALATION AS I COME UP
gMLscPBaw2M_12 0 I'M GOING TO KEEP EYE CONTACT WITH THE BELLY BUTTON
gMLscPBaw2M_13 0 I YOU KNOW WHAT MY SHOULDERS FIRST AND THEN I ON ROLL MY HEAD
gMLscPBaw2M_14 0 THIS YOU'RE GOING TO DO UNTIL YOUR NECK STARTS TO FATIGUE GNAT WHEN THEY FATIGUE BUT JUST BEFORE IF A TEAS AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO CATCH UP THE STRENGTH THAT THEY MAKE WITH THE ABDOMINAL STRENGTH
gMLscPBaw2M_15 0 SO DO ENOUGH FOR THE NECK UNTIL THEY MAKE FATIGUES AND THEN BEFORE YOU KNOW IT YOU'RE GOING TO BE TOUCHING UP WITH THE ABS AND I'LL SHOW YOU AN ADVANCED VERSION INTERNET IN ANOTHER DRAPES OFF SEASON

GEnXMNkJVOU_1 0 HI I'M AMELIA
GEnXMNkJVOU_2 0 I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO MAKE YOUR HAIR LOOK FULLER
GEnXMNkJVOU_3 0 WHEN TRYING TO MAKE YOUR HAIR LOOK FULLER WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS VOLUME TO THE TOP
GEnXMNkJVOU_4 0 YOU DON'T YOU REALLY NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT BOTTOM LAYER
GEnXMNkJVOU_5 0 ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO ADD QUICK VOLUME IS JUST A THROW SOME CURLS AND
GEnXMNkJVOU_6 0 YOU CAN DO THIS WITH A CURLING IRON A FLAT IRON HOT ROLLERS IT DOESN'T MATTER
GEnXMNkJVOU_7 0 BUT YOU JUST THROW SOME IN
GEnXMNkJVOU_8 0 IT CAN BE REAL RANDOM
GEnXMNkJVOU_9 0 AND THEN THESE BOTTOM LAYER IS YOU CAN JUST FLIP OUT A LITTLE BIT
GEnXMNkJVOU_10 0 WHEN YOUR HAIR IS ALL ONE LENGTH IT TENDS TO LOOK MORE FLAT
GEnXMNkJVOU_11 0 SO I DO RECOMMEND GETTING SOME SORT OF LAYERING
GEnXMNkJVOU_12 0 SPRAY A LITTLE BIT OF HAIR SPRAY
GEnXMNkJVOU_13 0 SO WE'LL TEASING THERE AT THE SCALP
GEnXMNkJVOU_14 0 USE YOUR FINGERS
GEnXMNkJVOU_15 0 AS YOU CAN SEE THIS SIDE COMPARED TO THE SIDE TO SIDE LOOKS A LOT FILLER
GEnXMNkJVOU_16 0 AND REALLY ALL WE DID WAS JUST ADD SOME CURLS TO THE TOP
GEnXMNkJVOU_17 0 ALSO TO KEEP IT ALL DAY YOU WANT TO ALWAYS SPRAY UNDERNEATH WITH THE HAIR STRIKE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU NEED THAT HOLD
GEnXMNkJVOU_18 0 YOU DON'T NEED IT UP TOP
GEnXMNkJVOU_19 0 WHEN YOU SPRAY ON TOP THAT HAIR SPRAY WAYS THAT HAIR DOWN

gtPwb4hPYe4_1 0 HI SO IN THIS SERIES WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT YOGA FOR STRENGTHENING THE UPPER BODY
gtPwb4hPYe4_2 0 AND THEY'RE HIS CERTAIN THINGS THAT PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT A LOT WHEN I THINK ABOUT TRYING TO BUILD UP STRENGTH IN YOUR UPPER BODY ESPECIALLY FOR US GIRLS
gtPwb4hPYe4_3 0 NUMBER ONE STRENGTHENING THE UPPER BODY IS NOT JUST ABOUT STRENGTHENING YOUR ARMS
gtPwb4hPYe4_4 0 IT'S ABOUT THE WHOLE PACKAGE WHICH INCLUDES YOUR PACKS AND IT INCLUDES YOUR TRIP EASIEST MUSCLES INCLUDES YOUR THE LAST IS IN THE STORE SIDE WHICH ARE OR ACROSS YOUR SHOULDER BLADES
gtPwb4hPYe4_5 0 SOME INCLUDES A LOT MORE AND THEN JUST USING YOUR ARMS
gtPwb4hPYe4_6 0 SO INTEGRATION IS KEY
gtPwb4hPYe4_7 0 YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO IN THESE POSES THINK ABOUT NOT JUST HOLDING YOURSELF WITH YOUR ARMS ARE PUSHING WITH YOUR ARMS BUT USING YOUR CORE PULLING IN THAT STRENGTH OUT FROM YOUR CORE AND SENDING IT OUT THROUGH YOUR MUSCLES USING YOUR BACK
gtPwb4hPYe4_8 0 USING ALL OF THAT POWER THAT YOU HAVE IN THOSE LAST WHICH ARE BIG STRONG MUSCLES
gtPwb4hPYe4_9 0 AND YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO THINK ABOUT SENDING THAT ENERGY OUT THROUGH YOUR ARMS AS WE STRENGTHEN AS WE PUSH AND AS WE RELEASE
gtPwb4hPYe4_10 0 THE OTHER THING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS THAT THERE ARE PUSHING MUSCLES AND THERE ARE PULLING MUSCLES
gtPwb4hPYe4_11 0 SO IN THESE POST IN THESE POSTURES WE'RE GOING TO WORK A LOT WITH SUPPORTING OUR OWN BODY WEIGHT
gtPwb4hPYe4_12 0 WHICH IS GOING TO MEAN THAT WE'RE WORKING ON OUR PUSHING MUSCLES
gtPwb4hPYe4_13 0 RIGHT TO SUPPORT PUSH UP
gtPwb4hPYe4_14 0 USING THOSE SORTS OF THINGS
gtPwb4hPYe4_15 0 IT IS GOOD TO HAVE BALANCE WHICH MEANS THAT YOU ALSO SHOULD FIND ANOTHER KIND OF PRACTICE FOR STRENGTHENING YOU'RE PULLING MUSCLES
gtPwb4hPYe4_16 0 SO JUST GO INTO THE GEM HANGING ON SOMETHING GETTING A CROSSBAR GETTING ONE OF THOSE CHUPP BARS TO PUT ACROSS YOUR DOOR
gtPwb4hPYe4_17 0 HANG ON IT AND SEE IF YOU CAN DO THOSE PULL UPS
gtPwb4hPYe4_18 0 LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT
gtPwb4hPYe4_19 0 JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND AND YOUR PRACTICE YOU WANT A TOTAL PRACTICE AND NOT JUST YOU'RE PUSHING MUSCLES NOT PULLING MUSCLES
gtPwb4hPYe4_20 0 ON THE OTHER IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THE UPPER BODY ENCOMPASSES THE FORCE SHOCKER WHICH IS THE HEART SHOCK
gtPwb4hPYe4_21 0 AND IN YOGA THIS IS QUITE A BEAUTIFUL THING
gtPwb4hPYe4_22 0 THE FORCE CHOKERS SHOCKER THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR HEART AND GIVING IN RECEIVING
gtPwb4hPYe4_23 0 IN YOGA THEY SAY THAT IF YOUR UPPER BODY IS STRONG YOU CAN GIVE AND YOU CAN RECEIVE HUGE BLESSINGS
gtPwb4hPYe4_24 0 SO KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN YOU'RE STRENGTHENING YOUR WHOLE UPPER BODY AND MAKE THIS A JOYFUL PRACTICE AND NOT JUST INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT ONE ESPECIALLY
gtPwb4hPYe4_25 0 EARLY

HCKYA56xZo4_2 0 THESE LITTLE THINGS WILL MAKE A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE IN A VERY CRITICAL DIFFERENT STAYING COMFORTABLE IN SUBZERO OTHERS
HCKYA56xZo4_3 0 JUST LIKE WITH THE SO CLOTHING YOU START GOING TO START WITH A SOAK LINER AND WORK YOUR WAY UP
HCKYA56xZo4_4 0 AND YOU DO THIS BOTH WITH YOUR HEAD COVERING AGAIN ON YOUR GLOVES
HCKYA56xZo4_5 0 YOU START WITH A SILK LINER AND THEN GO TO A POLYPROPYLENE LINER
HCKYA56xZo4_6 0 AND THEN ON TOP OF THE PROFILE INPUT LINER I PREFER TO WEAR A GLOB OF WHICH IS A GOLF MITTON COMBINATION
HCKYA56xZo4_7 0 THIS IS A WOOL CLIMATE AND BY WORKING IT THIS WAY I NOW I HAVE MY FINGERS FREE TO ADJUST THINGS
HCKYA56xZo4_8 0 TO PULL THE TRIGGER TO SHOOT TO GET THINGS OUT OF MY GEAR WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE MY GLOVES OFTEN GET MY WHOLE HAND CHILLED IN THAT MANNER
HCKYA56xZo4_9 0 AND THEN ALSO FOR FALL WHETHER PURPOSES YOU CAN GET A LEATHER SHELL TO PUT OVER TOP OF THE MINUTE AND THAT WILL ALSO STILL HAVE A LITTLE CREASE IN IT WHERE YOU GET YOUR FINGER OUT TO WORK THE TRIGGER
HCKYA56xZo4_10 0 BECAUSE THE OTHER CONSIDERATION AND THIS IS WHERE MOST YOUR HEAT LOSS WILL COME FROM IS AROUND YOUR NECK AND FROM YOUR HEAD
HCKYA56xZo4_11 0 SO YOUR HEAD COVERING AND AROUND YOUR NECK BECOME VERY VERY CRITICAL TO MAINTAIN YOUR BODY IN SUBZERO TEMPERATURES
HCKYA56xZo4_12 0 A NICE SILK SCARF WRAP AROUND YOUR NECK WILL INCREASE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WHILE YOU'RE ON STAND BY GOOD FIFTEEN TO TWENTY DEGREES
HCKYA56xZo4_13 0 IN THIS CASE THE HEAT FROM TOO MUCH HEAT FROM ESCAPING AROUND YOUR NECK AND YOUR OPEN COLLAR AREA AND IT'S ALSO WORKS AS WELL AS A REGULATOR SO YOU CAN REGULATE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE
HCKYA56xZo4_14 0 WHEN YOU START GETTING TOO WARM YOU CAN OPEN THE SCARF OR TAKE IT OFF AND THEN PUT THE SCARF BACK ON
HCKYA56xZo4_15 0 OKAY THE SAME THING WITH USING THIS SILK FACE MASK FIRST AND THEN FOLLOWED BY WOOL AND THEN YOU GET ON TOP OF THE WALL YOU CAN PUT A LITTLE WHETHER CARD
HCKYA56xZo4_16 0 THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE ARE WEAR GLASSES REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM
HCKYA56xZo4_17 0 BECAUSE NOW ALL MY MOISTURE ALL THAT'S COMING EVAPORATING OUT OF MY BODY ESCAPES AROUND MY GLASSES
HCKYA56xZo4_18 0 SO KEEP IN GLASSES THAWED OUT IN A NICE TEMPERATURES IT'S HARD TO DO IT
HCKYA56xZo4_19 0 SO TRY TO WEAR A PLASTIC LENSES OR GO TO TWO PAIR GLASSES AND YOU TAKE ONE PAIR OFF
HCKYA56xZo4_20 0 YOU STICK THEM IN YOUR POCKET SO THEY WARM UP AND THEN YOUR CONSTANT SWITCHING GLASSES
HCKYA56xZo4_21 0 SO IF YOU'RE IN HANDICAPPED LIKE I AM WHERE YOU HAVE TO WEAR GLASSES ALL THE TIME THIS BECOMES A LITTLE BIT OF A HASSLE

G6ObYwZN4tg_6 0 NOW I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT HOW THE FULCRUM ACTUALLY OF FACTS DIVING BOARD UP HERE
G6ObYwZN4tg_7 0 THE BOARD IS GOING TO BEND IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHERE YOU HAVE THE FULCRUM
G6ObYwZN4tg_8 0 SO IF I MOVE THE FULCRUM ALL THE WAY UP WHAT I'M DOING IS ACTUALLY SHORTENING THE DISTANCE TO THE END OF THE BOARD
G6ObYwZN4tg_9 0 IF YOU EVER TRIED TO PUSH DOWN ON SOMETHING IF YOU HAD A HEAVY WEIGHT THE SHORTER DISTANCE YOU HAVE BETWEEN YOURSELF AND THAT WEIGHT THE HARDER IT IS TO PUSH DOWN
G6ObYwZN4tg_10 0 BUT IF YOU'VE GOT A FULCRUM IN THE MIDDLE AND YOUR DISTANCES WILL HERE IT'S A LOT EASIER TO PUSH YOUR BAND OR MOVE THAT OBJECT
G6ObYwZN4tg_11 0 SO WHAT I'VE GOT THE FULCRUM ALL THE WAY UP FOR IS A LITTLE STIFFER
G6ObYwZN4tg_12 0 IT DOESN'T BEND AS MUCH
G6ObYwZN4tg_13 0 OKAY IF I MOVE THE FULCRUM IS ALL THE WAY BATH ON THE LENGTHENING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE END OF THE BOARD AND MY FULCRUM
G6ObYwZN4tg_14 0 THAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE BOARD WILL BEND FARTHER
G6ObYwZN4tg_15 0 NOW A COUPLE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT
G6ObYwZN4tg_16 0 WHEN THE BOARD BENDS FARTHER IT TAKES LONGER TO GO UP AND DOWN
G6ObYwZN4tg_17 0 IF IT'S CLOSER UP IT TAKES A SHORTER TIME

Gc-QWcSyGAA_4 0 SO IF YOU TOOK YOUR HEAD AND YOU JUST SLIGHTLY TURNED IT JUST ONE WAY I BREVE PUT IT BACK AND BREATHE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_5 0 NEVER EVER EVER BREATHE ON THE SAME SIDE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_6 0 SO I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU SOMETHING
Gc-QWcSyGAA_7 0 IT'S CALLED A ONE COUNT OF THREE COUNT OF FIVE COUNTING THE SEVEN COUNT
Gc-QWcSyGAA_8 0 IF YOU NOTICE ALL THOSE NUMBERS ARE ALL OUT
Gc-QWcSyGAA_9 0 THE REASON WHY THEY'RE OUT IS IF YOU DO IT ON AN EVEN COUNT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUOUSLY BREATHE IN THE SAME SIDE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_10 0 SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU
Gc-QWcSyGAA_11 0 YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE WILL STRING THEIR NECK BECAUSE YOU'RE SWIMMING IN YOUR REED ON ONE SIDE SWIM BREATHE IN THE SAME SIDE SWIM WITH THE SAME SIZE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_12 0 WELL IF YOU NOTICE IT'S AN EVEN COUNT

Gc-QWcSyGAA_15 0 ONE TWO THREE THREE THIS ARMS GOING ONE TWO THREE NOW YOU'RE BREATHING ON THE OTHER SIDE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_16 0 SO YOU ALWAYS COUNT EITHER ONE THREE FIVE OR SEVEN YOUR HEAD WHATEVER YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH BECAUSE EVERYONE'S LINES ARE DIFFERENTLY AND YOU'VE GOT A BUILD UP TOWARDS IT
Gc-QWcSyGAA_17 0 SO MOST TYPICALLY YOU'RE TAUGHT TO DO EVERY THREE STROKES
Gc-QWcSyGAA_18 0 EVERY THREE BREATHS EVERY THREE STROKES TO TAKE A BREATH
Gc-QWcSyGAA_19 0 SO LET ME SHOW YOU
Gc-QWcSyGAA_20 0 ONE TWO THREE BREED THIS ARM GOES ONE TWO THREE THREE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_21 0 AND IF YOU REMEMBER OUR BREATHING AS I'M PULLING
Gc-QWcSyGAA_22 0 THAT'S WHEN I TAKE MY BREATH
Gc-QWcSyGAA_23 0 NOT AS I'M GOING ON THREE TRYING TO BREATHE BECAUSE MY ARMS BLOCKING
Gc-QWcSyGAA_24 0 SO IT'S KIND OF COMMON SENSE REALLY WHEN YOU'RE LEARNING HOW TO SWIM
Gc-QWcSyGAA_25 0 SO JUST REMEMBER WHICH EVER ARM YOU START TO BEGIN YOUR PULL THAT IS THE SIDE THAT YOU WANT TO BREATHE OUT
Gc-QWcSyGAA_26 0 AND THEN YOUR HEAD YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO COUNT
Gc-QWcSyGAA_27 0 SO REALLY IF YOU WANT TO LEARN IT THE BEST TRYING TO DO IT OUT OF THE WATER FIRST AND COUNT ON YOUR HEAD

Gc-QWcSyGAA_31 0 BECAUSE THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO LEARN IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT BECAUSE IT'S ALL LIKE YOU'VE GOT ACCOUNTING YOUR HEAD
Gc-QWcSyGAA_32 0 AND YOUR ARMS DON'T EVER THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE NEXT TIME IT'S ONE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_33 0 THEY JUST SWITCHED
Gc-QWcSyGAA_34 0 SO THE WAX PLAYING THIS TO PEOPLE AS DON'T EVER TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHICH HAD IS WHAT NUMBER
Gc-QWcSyGAA_35 0 JUST TURN YOUR HEAD AND JUST MOVE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_36 0 SO ANY ARM COULD BE ONE TWO THREE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_37 0 STUDENT WHICHEVER ONE YOU START OFF WITH
Gc-QWcSyGAA_38 0 SO REMEMBER IT'S A ONE THREE FIVE SEVEN CARE FOR FREESTYLE STROKE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_39 0 ALRIGHT IN THIS SECTION OF FREESTYLE AS A CONTINUATION OF STEP NINE AND SO NOW THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO BREED YOU WANT TO DO IT ON DIFFERENT COUNTS
Gc-QWcSyGAA_40 0 SO YOU'LL DO IT ON ONE COUNT BUT TYPICALLY A GOOD ON A THREE COUNT OF FIVE COUNTER SEVEN CUP
Gc-QWcSyGAA_41 0 SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU GO ONE TWO THREE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_42 0 AS THIS WHICHEVER ARMY MAYBE THAT'S THREE AS IT'S MOVING BACK CLEAN YOU WANT TO BREATHE TO ONE SIDE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_43 0 TAKE A BREATH
Gc-QWcSyGAA_44 0 THERE'S ONE TWO THREE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_45 0 IS THAT ARM IS MOVING BACK YOU AGREE TO THAT SIDE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_46 0 TAKE A BREATH PUT YOUR HEAD BACK IN THE WATER
Gc-QWcSyGAA_47 0 TWO THREE WE'RE GOING TO SET
Gc-QWcSyGAA_48 0 SO FOR EVERY THREE STROKES NUT THAT TAKE
HEibb83JnGQ_1 0 SO LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW TO MARK YOUR LINE FOR THE DEPTH THAT YOU WANT TO FISH AT
HEibb83JnGQ_2 0 THIS IS USED FOR WHEN YOU'RE FISHING TIP UPS
HEibb83JnGQ_3 0 SO WE'VE SOUNDED OUR HOLE
HEibb83JnGQ_4 0 THE SOUND IS ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT NOW SO WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW DEEP IT IS
HEibb83JnGQ_5 0 SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO I'M GOING TO HOLD THAT LINE IN MY FINGER
HEibb83JnGQ_6 0 AND TYPICALLY WHEN YOUR ICE FISHING MOST PEOPLE FISH TWO TO THREE TO FOUR FEET OFF THE BOTTOM
HEibb83JnGQ_7 0 SO WE'VE GOT THAT
HEibb83JnGQ_8 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO ESTIMATE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FEET
HEibb83JnGQ_9 0 I'M GOING TO HOLD THAT
HEibb83JnGQ_10 0 I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO HOLD IT IN MY MOUTH BECAUSE IT'S EASIER
HEibb83JnGQ_11 0 I'M GOING TO BRING UP MY LINE SET THAT ASIDE FOR NOW
HEibb83JnGQ_12 0 AND THIS IS THE DEPTH THAT I WANT TO FISH AT
HEibb83JnGQ_13 0 THIS IS WHERE I WANT THE LINE TO BE ON MY REAL
HEibb83JnGQ_14 0 SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THAT
HEibb83JnGQ_15 0 ONE YOU CAN TIE A VERY SIMPLE SLIP KNOT AND JUST REALLY REALLY YOUR LINE UP TO THAT POINT
HEibb83JnGQ_16 0 HOWEVER WHEN A FIST TAKES THAT OFTEN THAT NOT COMES OUT
HEibb83JnGQ_17 0 SO THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT
HEibb83JnGQ_18 0 AND THAT ENTAILS JUST HAVING A SMALL BOBBER ON YOUR LINE THAT YOU PUT IT THE POINT WHERE YOU WANT TO FISH AT
HEibb83JnGQ_19 0 AND THEN THE OTHER OPTION SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY THREAD A BUTTON ON TO THE LINE
HEibb83JnGQ_20 0 THAT WORKS VERY WELL
HEibb83JnGQ_21 0 WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS JUST TO SIMPLY TIE THE SLIP KNOT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AND THEN JUST INSERT A MATCH STICK INTO IT
HEibb83JnGQ_22 0 AND TIGHTEN THAT NOT DOWN
HEibb83JnGQ_23 0 AGAIN THAT'S WHERE YOU REALLY YOUR LINE UP TO
HEibb83JnGQ_24 0 WHEN YOU CATCH A FISH AND YOU WANT TO REALLY BIG FISH THE MORE YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT DEPTH YOU ARE FISHING AT AND WHERE YOU WANT TO SET THAT LINE OUT AGAIN
HEibb83JnGQ_25 0 WHEN YOU'RE DONE FOR THE DAY SLIP OUT THE MATCH STICK THROW IT AWAY TAKE OUT YOUR SLIP KNOT AND YOU'RE READY TO FISH THE NEXT TIME

guQb5VRZGrI_1 0 HI MY NAME IS WINDY AND THIS IS HOW TO PLAY SKIP BOW
guQb5VRZGrI_2 0 SKIP BOW IS A TWO TO SIX PERSON GAME THAT IS SORT OF LIKE A COMPETITIVE SOLITAIRE
guQb5VRZGrI_3 0 EVERYONE IS DEALT OUT THIRTY CARDS FROM THEIR DECK
guQb5VRZGrI_4 0 IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN FOUR PEOPLE YOU ONLY DEALT TWENTY
guQb5VRZGrI_5 0 AFTER IT'S BEEN DEALT OUT YOU PUT THE REMAINDER OF THE DECK IN BETWEEN THE PLAYER IS ENOUGH TO DRAW
guQb5VRZGrI_6 0 I'VE PLACED EMPTY CARDS HERE TO SHOW YOU WHERE THE CARD PLAYING SLOTS WOULD BE BUT WHEN YOU PLAY THE GAME YOU WON'T BE PUTTING EMPTY CARDS OUT
guQb5VRZGrI_7 0 FIRST YOU DRAW FIVE CARDS FROM THE DECK
guQb5VRZGrI_8 0 THE THIRTY CARDS THAT WERE DEALT TO YOU OR YOUR STOCK PILE
guQb5VRZGrI_9 0 THE GOAL OF THE GAME IS TO GET RID OF YOUR STOCKPILE BEFORE ANYONE ELSE SO WHEN YOU START YOUR TURN YOU TURN OVER THE FIRST CARD ON YOUR STOCK PILE
guQb5VRZGrI_10 0 THIS IS A SIX
guQb5VRZGrI_11 0 SKIP BOA HAS NUMBERED CARDS FROM ONE TO TWELVE AND SPECIAL SKIP BOW CARDS WHICH ARE WILD CARDS
guQb5VRZGrI_12 0 THERE WILL BE FOR SLOTS IN BETWEEN THE TWO PLAYERS THAT ARE FOR STOCKPILING
guQb5VRZGrI_13 0 YOU CAN ALWAYS START A SLOT IF IT'S WITH THE NUMBER ONE OR A SKIP BOAT
guQb5VRZGrI_14 0 WHEN YOU PLAY THE SKIP BOW YOU ANNOUNCE WHAT NUMBER YOU WISH IT TO BE AND THEN PLAY IS SO YOU WOULD PLAY THAT NUMBER SO THIS IS A SIX I SAY
guQb5VRZGrI_15 0 SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN AND SO FORTH UP UNTIL TWELVE
guQb5VRZGrI_16 0 ONCE YOU REACH TWELVE EITHER FROM STARTING WITH THE NATURAL ONE THERE WAS A SKIP WELL THEN THE CARD PILE IS TAKEN AWAY AND THERE'S A NEW SLOT OPEN TO START A NEW STOCK PILE
guQb5VRZGrI_17 0 IF YOU RUN OF DRAW CARDS YOU COULD JUST SHUFFLE IN THE WOOD COMPLETED STOCKPILE CARDS AND KEEP DRAWING SO YOU MAY PLAY AS LONG AS YOU CAN PLAY ON ONE OF THESE FOR PILES OF SEQUENTIAL NUMBER
guQb5VRZGrI_18 0 YOU CAN PLAY EITHER OUT OF YOUR HAND OR OFF THE TOP OF YOUR STOCKPILE DROP YOUR DISCARD PILES IF YOU HAVE CARDS THAT YOU CAN PLAY
guQb5VRZGrI_19 0 IF YOU READ OF CARDS AND YOU'VE MANAGED TO DO SUCCESSFUL STOCKPILES WITH THEM AND YOU USE LAST TURN YOUR YOU PLAYED WHEN YOU CAN DRAW
guQb5VRZGrI_20 0 YOU CAN KEEP DRAWING UNTIL YOU CAN NO LONGER PLACE A CARD AND THEN YOUR TURN IS DONE
guQb5VRZGrI_21 0 THEN IF YOU TURN YOU MUST DISCARD ONE CARD IN YOUR HAND
guQb5VRZGrI_22 0 IT GOES INTO ONE OF FOR SLOTS ON YOUR DISCARD TABLE
guQb5VRZGrI_23 0 USUALLY YOU START WITH NO IT'S NO CARDS SO YOU CAN HAVE OF TO FOR OPEN AFTER THE FOURTH WHEN YOU START TO OF PLACING YOUR DISCARDS ON TOP OF OTHER CARDS BUT THE ONLY CARDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR PLAY ARE THE ONES WHO'S FACES UP SO YOU CONTINUE IN THIS BETTER AND YOU CAN PUT ANYONE CAN PLAY ON TO THE CENTER STOCKPILE CARDS AND YOU PLAY UNTIL TWELVE AND THEN YOU REMOVE IT AND YOU KEEP GOING UNTIL SOMEONE HAS RUN OUT OF THEIR STOCKPILE SO EVEN THOUGH I YOU WANT TO USE YOUR DISCARD PILE IS REALLY THE STRATEGY IS TO GET RID OF YOUR STOCKPILE CARD THE MOST
guQb5VRZGrI_24 0 YOU'RE AIMING TO GET THE STOCKPILES MEN IN THE MIDDLE TO A A POINT WHERE YOU COULD USE YOUR STOCK PILE

_G7tWX0egAU_1 0 SO BEFORE YOU GO ANYWHERE ON THE RIVER WITH THE CANOE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR WE HAVE A FEW ESSENTIAL ITEMS WITH YOU
_G7tWX0egAU_2 0 THE FIRST AND MOST ESSENTIAL ITEM OF ALL IS YOUR PFD YOUR PERSONAL FLOTATION DEVICE
_G7tWX0egAU_3 0 THIS IS MY LIFE JACKET SOMETHING THAT YOU WEAR AS A VAST YOU WANT TO GET ONE IT'S COMFORTABLE IT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOU ARE IF YOU IF YOU SAW TO YOUR BOAT OR YOU GO SWIMMING AND VIRTUALLY ALL OF THESE ARE COAST GUARD APPROVED SO THE WEST COAST GUARD APPROVES THE VEST BASED ON THEIR DESIGN BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF A FLOTATION THEY HAVEN'T THEM AND YOU'LL SEE THAT IN THE INSIDE OF THE BACK OF EVERY VEST THERE'S A COAST GUARD APPROVED INSIGNIA AND THAT'LL TELL YOU WHAT TYPE IT IS
_G7tWX0egAU_4 0 THESE ARE TYPE THREE MORE TYPE THREE FIVE AND TYPE THREE OR TYPE THREE FIVE OR THE CAR AND YOU WANT TO USE FOR WHITEWATER CANOEING GENERALLY
_G7tWX0egAU_5 0 THE OTHER BENEFIT OF THE VEST IS THEY PROTECT YOUR BACK AND YOUR SPINE FROM AN IMPACT IF YOU GO SWIMMING AND THEY ALSO GIVE YOU SOME WARMTH SO IF IT'S COLD OUT WEARING YOUR LIFE VEST ACTUALLY CAN KEEP YOUR WARMER BECAUSE THEY HAVE A SPARE MIGHT OF INSULATION IN THEM
_G7tWX0egAU_6 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR LIFE VEST FITS PROPS AND ONE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO WHEN YOU PUT IT ON SINCE DOWN ALL THE STRAPS THIS IS THE HAPPENS TO BE A RESCUE BREATHS SO I HAVE A QUICKLY IS RELEASED TOE HARNESS ON IT AS WELL WHICH I SINCE DOWN AND THEN HAVE EITHER YOURSELF FOR A FRIEND LIFTED UP BY THE SHOULDERS AND IF YOU COME WITH THE VAST THAT SCREW THAT MEANS IT'S ON NICE AND SNUGGLY IF YOU DON'T IF THE VEST COMES UP AND STARTS RIGHT UP TO YOUR EARS ARE RISE UP IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE IT'S ONTO LOOSELY AND YOU WANT TO TIGHTEN IT UP BECAUSE IF YOU GO FOR A SWIM YOU WANT TO BE IN THE VEST YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE DRESS COMING OFF YOU WOULD HAVE TO EITHER PULL IT BACK ON OR LOSE IT
_G7tWX0egAU_7 0 THE OTHER MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF SAFETY GEAR FOR WHITEWATER CANOEING IS A HELMET AND IF YOU HAVE A GOOD HELMET THAT FITS YOUR HEAD WELL AND IT WILL STAY ON WELL AND IT WILL PROTECT YOUR HEAD FROM THOSE OCCASIONAL BUMPS ON ROCKS WHEN YOU FLIP OUT OF YOUR BOAT OR EVEN FROM YOUR TEA GRIP IF IT HAPPENS TO AIRLIE HIT IN THE HEAD WHICH THEY DO OCCASIONALLY DO

_G7tWX0egAU_9 0 BUT DEPENDING ON WHO ON WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GO IN ONCE YOUR WHAT KIND OF YOU NEED TO HAVE YOU CAN CHOOSE A DIFFERENT KIND OF HELMET BUT MAKE SURE THAT IT FITS WELL AND MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU'RE ON WHITEWATER YOU DO HAVE A HELMET WITH YOU

gKpYu50LLps_1 0 OKAY SO WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT BLOOD PRESSURE IS
gKpYu50LLps_2 0 A BLOOD PRESSURE IS DIVIDED INTO CYST ALL OF PRESSURE AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURE AND THOSE PRESSURES REPRESENT DIFFERENT SLIGHT DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE CARDIAC CYCLE
gKpYu50LLps_3 0 BUT WHEN YOU GET YOUR RECORDING YOU GET AT LIKE ONE TWENTY OVER EIGHTY
gKpYu50LLps_4 0 THAT TOP NUMBER IS YOUR SAYS STYLE OF PRESSURE AND THE BOTTOM NUMBER IS YOUR DICED ON PRESSURE AND WHAT THOSE PRESSURES REPRESENT IS A THEY REPRESENT A PRESSURE WITHIN THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM
gKpYu50LLps_5 0 THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM WHICH IS THE A ORDER AND THE PRESSURE WITH IN THIS IS A REPRESENTATION OF THE PRESSURE IN THE ORDER WHEN YOU TAKE SOMEONE'S BLOOD PRESSURE
gKpYu50LLps_6 0 SO THIS CYST ALL THE PRESSURE IS THE PRESSURE WITHIN THE ORDER JUST AFTER THAT HARD CAN TRACKS
gKpYu50LLps_7 0 THIS SAY YOUR IS FILLED UP WITH HIGHER AMOUNT OF PRESSURE
gKpYu50LLps_8 0 SO IT'S THE PRESSURE WITH IN THE ORDER OR THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM UP MORE SO THE BRAKE YOU'LL ARTERY AFTER THAT HARD CONTRACT
gKpYu50LLps_9 0 AND THE DIASTOLIC PRESSURE IS THE PRESSURE WITHIN THAT ARTERIAL SYSTEM JUST AFTER THE HEART RELAXES SO WE HAVE CONSTANT CONTRACTION RIGHT HERE IN THIS FAN TRICKLE SHOOTS PLUG UP THROUGH THE THE ORDER AND THEN IT RELAXES
gKpYu50LLps_10 0 THE PRESSURE DECREASES SO THAT'S WHY THAT DIASTOLIC IS A LITTLE BIT LOWER
gKpYu50LLps_11 0 SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE AN ACTUAL PATIENT EXAMPLE AND SEE HOW THESE PRESSURES RELATE TO SOMEONE'S ACTUAL READING

h5XbO0N36WU_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET WITH A COMPLETE PACKAGE WHEN YOU PURCHASE KITE
h5XbO0N36WU_2 0 THERE'S A SERIES ADVANTAGE TO BIND KITE FROM A PROPER RETAILER
h5XbO0N36WU_3 0 YOU KNOW THAT YOU ACTUALLY GETTING IT YOU KNOW A BRAND NEW KITE IT'S GOT WARRANTY IT'S TOTALLY GOOD UP TO WORKING SPEED IN ORDER
h5XbO0N36WU_4 0 AND YOU'RE GETTING WITH ALL ESSENTIALS AND EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR THAT KITE SUCH AS A PUMP BAR LINES AND THE ACTUAL KINDS OF BRIDLES IT HASN'T BEEN STYLE
h5XbO0N36WU_5 0 OLDER KITES ARE GOOD DEFINITELY GOOD TO LEARN ON
h5XbO0N36WU_6 0 BUT YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE GETTING A QUALITY PRODUCT
h5XbO0N36WU_7 0 THIS KITE HAS YOUR LIFE IT'S HANDS
h5XbO0N36WU_8 0 SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE SOMETHING SOLID NO YOU COULD DEFINITELY FIND YOURSELF IN A KITE NEAR SITUATION
h5XbO0N36WU_9 0 SO RIGHT NEAR NIGHTMARE DOING THAT IS PRETTY SELF EXPLANATORY
h5XbO0N36WU_10 0 IF YOU HAVE A KITE OR UP PUMP RIGHT HERE SOMETIMES IT'LL COME WITH A PRESSURE GAUGE
h5XbO0N36WU_11 0 YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE IN A SALTY CITY SCENARIO WHEN USING THIS KITE OR THE PUMP SO AGAIN JUST PROBABLY ALIEN WORK FROM THE FIRST DOESN'T TIME TO TAKE THAT KITE UP
h5XbO0N36WU_12 0 SO YOU WANT TO GET A GOOD SOLID FEEL ON HOW MUCH PRESSURE YOU WANT TO PUT IN THAT KITE
h5XbO0N36WU_13 0 FOR OUR KITE IT'S ALWAYS BETTER
h5XbO0N36WU_14 0 YOU KNOW YOU WANT A RIGID STRUCTURE TO THE PROFILE THAT KITE SO FLIES APPROPRIATELY
h5XbO0N36WU_15 0 IF YOU DON'T PUT ENOUGH AIR INTO IT YOU KNOW YOUR CASE AND FIRE RADICALLY NOT WHAT YOU WANT
h5XbO0N36WU_16 0 IF YOU FIND A PUMP THAT YOU KNOW IT'S GOT TOO MUCH SAND IT VERY BASICALLY DOESN'T WORK THE SAME WAY WAS ANY SORT OF GENERAL LUBRICANT AND BASICALLY JUST CAUSE THE ENTIRE SHAFT
h5XbO0N36WU_17 0 AND YOU KNOW A COUPLE TIMES JUST WORKING IT IN AND OUT OF THE BIRD AND THAT IS HOW TO PUMP BACKGROUND IN
h5XbO0N36WU_18 0 SO EVERY TIME YOU ARE USING YOUR GEAR GENERAL MAINTENANCE YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY AND EVERY TIME NECESSITY
h5XbO0N36WU_19 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE ALL YOUR STUFF IS POSITIVELY PROPER WORKING AND YOU KNOW JUST AS GOOD AS NEW
h5XbO0N36WU_20 0 SO THAT'S THAT
G_Cg1ldU2kg_1 0 THE NEXT AREA THAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS TRYING TO KEEP YOUR SHOULDERS ABOVE YOUR KNEES
G_Cg1ldU2kg_2 0 THE BASIC STANCE IN BOXING ASTRADDLE DEMONSTRATE HERE IS ACTUALLY HAVE YOUR HEELS SHOULDER WIDTH APART
G_Cg1ldU2kg_3 0 AND FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT THAT COURSE IS GOING TO VARY
G_Cg1ldU2kg_4 0 CHAD IT'S GOT ABOUT AN EIGHTEEN HANDS SHOULDER WIDTH SO HIS IS HEEL SHOULD BE ABOUT EIGHTEEN INCHES APART TWENTY FOUR INCHES BETWEEN THEIR SOMEWHERE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_5 0 NOW AS HE'S ADVANCING HE WANTS TO KEEP HIS SHOULDER JUST ABOVE THE KNEE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_6 0 THAT'S THE PROPER WAY OF DOING IT
G_Cg1ldU2kg_7 0 AND VICE VERSA
G_Cg1ldU2kg_8 0 GOING BACKWARDS WE DON'T WANT TO LEAN TOO FAR BACK
G_Cg1ldU2kg_9 0 WE WANT TO STILL KEEP THE SHOULDER ABOVE THE KNEE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_10 0 NOW SHOWING THE WRONG WAY IS IF IF HE MOVES HIS SHOULDER PAST DISNEY HE'S YOU CAN SEE HE'S WAY OUT STRETCH OKAY AND THAT PUT THAT BACK FOOT UP OFF THE GROUND
G_Cg1ldU2kg_11 0 WHAT THAT'S GOING TO DO IS GOING TO HELP HIM TO TOPPLE OVER POSSIBLY
G_Cg1ldU2kg_12 0 SO HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HEEL GOES WITH THE SHOULDER
G_Cg1ldU2kg_13 0 KEEP THE SHOULDER ABOVE THE KNEES BASICALLY
G_Cg1ldU2kg_14 0 AND YOUR HEEL IS GOING TO BE BELOW YOUR KNEE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_15 0 SO ONCE YOU'VE GOT YOUR SHOULDER ABOVE YOUR KNEE AND YOU SHOULD BE FINE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_16 0 ALSO GOING BACKWARDS YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_17 0 IF THIS SHOULDER IS PAST HIS KNEE IN THE BACK HE IS TOO FAR BACK AND THAT'S ALSO A DANGEROUS SITUATION
G_Cg1ldU2kg_18 0 IF WE'RE MOVING TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT WE SHOULD ALSO TRY TO KEEP THAT SHOULDER ABOVE THE KNEE AT ALL TIMES ON SO THAT WE'RE NOT LEANING TOO FAR OFF TO ONE SIDE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_19 0 ONCE YOU START LEANING TOO FAR FORWARD TOO FAR BACK OR TOO FAR TO ONE SIDE AND MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO GETTING KNOCKED OVER WHEN YOU DO GET PUNCHED
G_Cg1ldU2kg_20 0 SHOULDERS ABOVE NAMES

GyXb5y1Cuas_6 0 THE SECOND IS YOUR PRESSURE FELT AND THIS ACTUALLY IS A BIT THICKER THAN THE OTHER ONES AND IT'S GOING TO ALLOW THAT PAPER TO BE MOLDED DOWN INTO THE MATRIX AND PULL OUT THE INK
GyXb5y1Cuas_7 0 AND THE LAST FELTS IS YOUR PUSH YOUR FELT AND THIS ONE ACTUALLY GOES UP AGAINST THE DRUM IS GOING TO TAKE THE BEADING FROM THE DRUM
GyXb5y1Cuas_8 0 IT'S NOT A REAL BEATING BET
GyXb5y1Cuas_9 0 IT'S WOVEN SO IT'S A LITTLE STURDIER THAN THE OTHER FILLS

-Hbfy0dOoos_4 0 WE'RE SHOOTING A NECKLACE FOR LINDSAY COLBUS JEWELRY DESIGNER NEW YORK
-Hbfy0dOoos_5 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WHEN SHOOTING A NECKLACE IS MAKE SURE YOU PRESENTING THE PIECE OF JEWELRY IN A WAY THAT IT'S GOING TO LOOK ACTUALLY WORN ON A PERSON
-Hbfy0dOoos_6 0 VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING AT IT ON A WEBSITE OR IN A CATALOG CAN GET A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE ON THEM
-Hbfy0dOoos_7 0 SO THE KEY TO THAT IS MAKING SURE THE BOTTOM AREA IS GOING TO HANG OR DRAPE THE WEIGHT PROBABLY WOULD WHEN A PERSON IS WEARING IT
-Hbfy0dOoos_8 0 AND YOU'RE GOING TO WANT A STYLE IT IN THAT MANNER
-Hbfy0dOoos_9 0 ALSO WITH THIS PIECE OF JEWELRY IN PARTICULAR YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PENDANTS ON IT SO THERE'S MORE OF AN AREA THAT YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON WITH YOUR CAMERA THEN JUST SAY IF THERE WAS ONE PENDANT OR IF THEY WERE ALL SORT OF BUNCH TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF THE NECKLACE ITSELF
-Hbfy0dOoos_10 0 WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS JUST KIND OF STRETCH IT OUT HERE A LITTLE BIT AND THEN JUST TO FORM A LITTLE BIT OF A ALMOST A HEART SHAPE
-Hbfy0dOoos_11 0 I THINK THIS REALLY REFLECTS YOU'VE GOT THE PERSON'S NECK HERE THE NECKLACE DRAPES DOWN IT'S FAIRLY SYMMETRICAL YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE ALL THE PIECES ARE ORIENTED CORRECTLY
-Hbfy0dOoos_12 0 SOMETIMES IF THE JEWELRY ITSELF IS VERY COMPLEX OR THE PIECES ARE TOUGH TO DISTINGUISH YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET IT SET UP EXACTLY RIGHT
-Hbfy0dOoos_13 0 SO IT'S IMPORTANT HAVE A STYLIST OR EVEN THE DESIGNER THERE TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE SHOWING THE JEWELRY THE MATES THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE WORN

GSFBHm2CAqc_1 0 HI I'M THE STAR GODDESS AND HERE'S A TIP FOR ENDING A RELATIONSHIP WITH A SCORPIO
GSFBHm2CAqc_2 0 THE TRUTH BE TELL THE ONLY WAY REALLY TENDER RELATIONSHIP WITH A SCORPIO IS TO DIE SCORPIO TRULY FEELS THE PHRASE THAT IF YOU LOVE SOMETHING SET IT FREE
GSFBHm2CAqc_3 0 IF IT COMES BACK IS MEANT TO BE
GSFBHm2CAqc_4 0 IF IT DOESN'T TRACK IT DOWN AND KILL A DAY
GSFBHm2CAqc_5 0 WHAT A SCORPIO SAYS I LOVE YOU THEY NEED FOR THIS LIFETIME THE ONE AFTER THAT AND THE WIDE AND AFTER THAT
GSFBHm2CAqc_6 0 SCORPIO HAS A LITTLE OR NO ABILITY TO DETACH FROM SOMETHING THAT IT'S ATTRACTED TO
GSFBHm2CAqc_7 0 SO IF YOU TRULY WANT TO GET RID OF A SCORPIO THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO MANIFEST BEHAVIOR THAT THEY DON'T LIFE SO THE SCORPIO CHOOSES TO NOT WANT YOU ANYMORE
GSFBHm2CAqc_8 0 THE BEST THING TO DO TO GET RID OF A SCORPIO STEP SEX WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND AND THEN THEY'LL BE DONE FOREVER

gS8GzCQVGH8_2 0 HI I'M CAPTAIN JOE BRUNI
gS8GzCQVGH8_3 0 WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS HOW TO TREAT THE STUB TELL
gS8GzCQVGH8_4 0 STOP TOE CAN BE A PRETTY PAINFUL EXPERIENCE
gS8GzCQVGH8_5 0 THE FIRST STEP IS TO EVALUATE TO SEE IF THERE'S ACTUALLY BEEN A WOUND CREATED AFTER THE TOE HAS BEEN DAMAGED OR STOP
gS8GzCQVGH8_6 0 IF THERE'S BEEN A WOUND CLEAN THE WOUND OUT TO REMOVE ANY DIRT OR DEBRIS THAT MAY HAVE GOTTEN INTO THE WOUND TO PREVENT SECONDARY FORMS OF INFECTION FROM OCCURRING
gS8GzCQVGH8_7 0 SOME TYPE OF SOAP AND WATER ARE ANTISEPTIC SOLUTION FOR FIRST AID CAN BE USED TO CLEAN THE WOUND AREA
gS8GzCQVGH8_8 0 THEN ICE CAN BE APPLIED TO REDUCE SWELLING AND PAIN
gS8GzCQVGH8_9 0 I SHOULD BE APPLIED IN TWENTY MINUTE INCREMENTS OF TWENTY MINUTES ON AND TWENTY MINUTES OFF TO AVOID HAVING SOME TYPE OF COLD INJURY FROM THE ICE PACK ITSELF OCCUR
gS8GzCQVGH8_10 0 AFTER THE APPLICATION OF ICE THE TOE COULD BE SPLINTED OR TAPED TO THE TOE NEXT TO IT TO REDUCE MOBILITY AND KEEP THAT TOE FROM FLEXING OR BENDING
gS8GzCQVGH8_11 0 OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS REST AND AVOID USING THAT TOE UNTIL THE HEALING PROCESS TAKES PLACE AND HAS OCCURRED

gJGhRrSaPlQ_2 0 IF YOUR SIGHT HIS BID SIXTY RIGHT AND YOU HAVE THIRTY FIVE MELD YOU'LL NEED TWENTY FIVE COUNTERS TO MAKE THAT BID
gJGhRrSaPlQ_3 0 YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO GET TWENTY FIVE
gJGhRrSaPlQ_4 0 IF YOU DON'T HAVE TWENTY FIVE COUNTERS YOU WILL NOT MAKE YOUR BID SO KEEP IN MIND THE STRONGER THAN MELD YOU HAVE IN YOUR HAND THE MORE ROOM YOU HAVE THE BIDDING
gJGhRrSaPlQ_5 0 FOR EXAMPLE IF WE HAD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MELD WE HAVE A DOUBLE RUN A SUIT THAT'S A POWERFUL HAND NOW WE HAVE LOTS OF ROOM BECAUSE ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS MAKE OUR TWENTY MELD THAT'S THE BASIC REQUIREMENT WE SAVE OUR TWENTY MELD HUNDRED FIFTY POINTS IS GOING TO PICK UP AN AWFUL LOT OF OVER ROOM FOR ERROR IF WE FELT FALL SHORT ARE ENCOUNTERS THAT IS IF WE DON'T HAVE MORE THAN YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE A NORMAL COUNTERS THAT'S FINE
gJGhRrSaPlQ_6 0 WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE TWENTY AND THAT'S THE KEY NUMBERS SO AGAIN MELD BIDDING AND COUNTERS VERY IMPORTANT AND YOU SHOULD REMEMBER THOSE COMBINATIONS
GVLVEmMFvNE_1 0 DR JOE NEELY AND I PRACTICE WITH THE BARTON OAKS DENTAL GROUP
GVLVEmMFvNE_2 0 I'M GOING TO DISCUSS THAT WILL PROCEDURES WHICH IS A VERY BROAD CATEGORY
GVLVEmMFvNE_3 0 A DENTAL PROCEDURE CAN BE ANYTHING AS SIMPLE AS A OF A CLEANING WHICH IS REMOVING THE HARD DEPOSITS THAT YOU CAN'T GET OFF YOURSELF OFF YOUR TEETH
GVLVEmMFvNE_4 0 FOR REMOVING THE SOFT DEPOSITS CENTER IN AREAS THAT ARE SO FAR UP INTO THE GUM YOU PHYSICALLY CAN'T GET TO THEM
GVLVEmMFvNE_5 0 TO SKATING ROOT PLANING WHICH IS THE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR IN NATURE TO CLEANING
GVLVEmMFvNE_6 0 EXCEPT IT REQUIRES ANESTHESIA BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE ATTACHMENT TOGETHER TO THE TODAY IN ORDER TO GET BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE HARD IT'S HARDER TO REMOVE IT
GVLVEmMFvNE_7 0 YOU HAVE THE DOUGH PROCEDURE OF SEALANT WHICH IS SIMPLY CLEANING OUT THE GROOVES OF THE TOOTH
GVLVEmMFvNE_8 0 THE AND THE CAGE GROUPS OF THE TOOTH
GVLVEmMFvNE_9 0 ASSURING YOURSELF THAT THERE IS NO DECAY INDIAN ITCHING THE TOOTH CREATING SOME KIND OF ACID EDGE TO THE TOOTH IN APPLYING A A PLASTIC COATING THAT FITS INTO THE GROOVES THE TEETH TO PROTECT IT BEGINS TO CARRY
GVLVEmMFvNE_10 0 YOU HAVE A FILLING WHICH IS SIMPLY GOING IN AND PHYSICALLY REMOVING ANY INFECTED OF PART OF THE TOOTH ENAMEL
GVLVEmMFvNE_11 0 THE BACTERIA LIVE OFF OF PLAQUE WHICH IS A COMBINATION OF OF BACTERIA IN FOOD SOURCE AND GELATINOUS MASS STICKS TO THE TAPE
GVLVEmMFvNE_12 0 ONCE THE THEREBY PRODUCT IS ACID ONCE THE ACID EATS THROUGH THE HEART OUTER SHELL OF THE TOOTH TAKEN THE BACTERIA CANAL LIVE OFF OF THE TO INTERNAL PORTION OF THE TOOTH
GVLVEmMFvNE_13 0 AND IN ORDER TO KEEP IT FROM DESTROYING THE TOOTH YOU HAVE TO GO IN AND PHYSICALLY CUT THAT PART OUT
GVLVEmMFvNE_14 0 I ENDED THAT MUCH THAT PART OF THE TOOTH IT'S BEEN REMOVED IS RESTORED WITH A FILLING
GVLVEmMFvNE_15 0 THERE ARE NUMEROUS TYPES OF FILLING MATERIALS
GVLVEmMFvNE_16 0 WHEN THE DEFECT BECOMES LARGE ENOUGH THAT STRUCTURALLY YOU CAN'T THE TOOTH CAN SUPPORT A FILLING ANY LONGER
GVLVEmMFvNE_17 0 THEN THE OPPOSITE IS DONE
GVLVEmMFvNE_18 0 OR THE PERIMETER OF THE TOOTH IS REMOVED AND THEN A CRAYON IS DONE OVER THE TOOTH
GVLVEmMFvNE_19 0 I CRAYON LITTLE BRINGS STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FROM THE OUTSIDE TO THE TOOTH WHERE IS A FILLING REQUIRES A TOOTH TO PROVIDE THE STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FOR THE FILLER
GVLVEmMFvNE_20 0 I CROWNS CONVEY A COMBINATION OF OF METAL AND PORCELAIN TO GAIN THE COMBINATION STATION OF STRENGTH FROM THE METAL IN THE ASCETIC SO PORCELAIN
GVLVEmMFvNE_21 0 IT CAN BE ALL PORCELAIN FOR GREATER AESTHETICS POWER CAN BE ALL METAL IN EARRINGS WORD NOTHING ELSE THAT SIDE
GVLVEmMFvNE_22 0 YOU ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY PROCEDURE WOULD BE A VENEER WHICH IS NOTHING MORE THAN IN JUST HARD AND THIN PART OF A CROWN
GVLVEmMFvNE_23 0 IT SAYS EXACTLY LIKE A PORCELAIN CROWN EFFECT IN TODAY'S WORLD FOR WHERE VENEER STOPS AND CROWN STARTS IS A VERY VERY GREAT AREA
GVLVEmMFvNE_24 0 BECAUSE IT'S ALL A MATTER OF PERCENTAGES
GVLVEmMFvNE_25 0 OTHER PROCEDURES WITH THE ROOT CANALS WHICH IS THE REMOVAL OF THE THE CONTENTS OF THE TOOTH
GVLVEmMFvNE_26 0 IT'S TRACTION WHICH WOULD BE THE REMOVAL OF THE TOOTH
GVLVEmMFvNE_27 0 BIOPSY WHICH WOULD BE THE REMOVAL OF TISSUE TO BE STUDIED UNDER A MICROSCOPE
GVLVEmMFvNE_28 0 WHY IT'S AND IN THIS AND THIS GOES ON THEM
gH-FfNW0BDM_2 0 MINE TEARING
gH-FfNW0BDM_3 0 IF I'M ON THE ADMINISTRATOR OF CALIFORNIA HOME EDUCATORS AND PRINCIPAL SUNLAND CHRISTIAN SCHOOL
gH-FfNW0BDM_4 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS HOME SCHOOLING RIGHT FOR ME
gH-FfNW0BDM_5 0 MAYBE YOU BEGIN TO LOOK INTO HOME SCHOOLING AND THE FIGURE OUT HOW IT WORKS WHERE TO BEGIN
gH-FfNW0BDM_6 0 THESE ARE RIGHT FOR ME
gH-FfNW0BDM_7 0 SHOULD MY FAMILY HOME SCHOOL
gH-FfNW0BDM_8 0 THERE ARE A FEW POINTS THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER AS YOU APPROACH THIS QUESTION
gH-FfNW0BDM_9 0 FIRST OFF THE NEEDS OF YOUR CHILD
gH-FfNW0BDM_10 0 IT IS YOUR CHILD IN THE POSITION OF LIFE WHERE HOME SCHOOL BENEFIT THEM
gH-FfNW0BDM_11 0 IS YOUR FAMILY IN A POSITION WHERE YOU CAN HOME SCHOOL THEM
gH-FfNW0BDM_12 0 FINANCES MAYBE AN ISSUE
gH-FfNW0BDM_13 0 WE ALSO WANT YOU TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN YOU BEGIN THIS PROCESS TO STAY COMMITTED TO IT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND REALIZING THAT THEY'LL BE WONDERFUL DAYS THEY'LL BE DAYS A BLESSING THEN THEY'LL BE DAYS OF CHALLENGE
gH-FfNW0BDM_14 0 JUST BECAUSE YOUR TEACHING YOUR CHILD HOME DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO WORK
gH-FfNW0BDM_15 0 IF YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR THAT
gH-FfNW0BDM_16 0 BUT THE BENEFITS FROM HOME SCHOOLING WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT ARE THINGS TO CONSIDER
gH-FfNW0BDM_17 0 WHY IS HOME SCHOOLING RIGHT FOR ME
gH-FfNW0BDM_18 0 WE'LL IT HELP OUR FAMILY PULL TOGETHER
gH-FfNW0BDM_19 0 WILL HELP US IN OUR PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIP
gH-FfNW0BDM_20 0 AS YOU CONSIDER THESE YOU CAN COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT ALL FACTORS BEING CORRECT HOME SCHOOLING CAN WORK FOR JUST ABOUT ANY STUDENT IN ANY FAMILY
h2dZglgVX3I_1 0 NOW THERE ARE VARIOUS METHODS OF DELIVERY OUT ONCE YOU HAVE THE MEDICATION THERE AGAIN DEPENDING ON THE AGE OF THAT THE PERSON
h2dZglgVX3I_2 0 FOR MYSELF AS I WAS MENTIONING MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH THE NEBULIZER WAS WHAT MY SON WAS ABOUT NINE MONTHS OLD AND HE PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE TOLERATED THE MASS BEING AT HIS FACE
h2dZglgVX3I_3 0 MOST KIDS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO TEAR THE MASK AND MAKES FOR A FAIRLY UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE ALL THE WAY AROUND
h2dZglgVX3I_4 0 BUT FOR CHILDREN THAT A LITTLE BIT OLDER ADULTS ONE WAY OF DELIVERING THE MEDICATION I'LL SHOW YOU RIGHT HERE IS TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY AGAIN THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
h2dZglgVX3I_5 0 PUTTING THIS TOGETHER LIKE THIS YOU'VE GOT THE TUBE HERE AND THEN THIS IS THE PIECE YOU WANT TO TURN IT LIKE LIKE SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY PUT IN THEIR MOUTH
h2dZglgVX3I_6 0 AND THEN ONCE YOU HAVE THAT ASSEMBLE ASSEMBLED AGAIN GOING TO KIND OF PUSH AND TWIST A LITTLE BIT AND THEN THE PERSON WOULD ACTUALLY HOLD IT AND PUT THIS IN THEIR MOUTH AND BE ABLE TO BREATHE THE MEDICATION IN THAT WAY SO THAT'S ONE WAY
h2dZglgVX3I_7 0 AND THEN THE OTHER METHOD OF YOU KNOW FOR A CHILD ME YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THIS IS FOR A CHILD USE GOT THE DINOSAUR NUT IN MY KIDS DID APPRECIATE THAT THE MASK FORM
h2dZglgVX3I_8 0 AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS DIRECTLY PUT THE MASK RIGHT ONTO HERE AND THEN OF COURSE THIS WILL GO AROUND THE CHILD'S HEAD AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO JUST GO AHEAD AND BREATHE IN IT AND IT
h2dZglgVX3I_9 0 IT HAS THIS ALLOWS FOR SOME AIR FLOW OUT THE TUBE HERE THIS ALSO ALLOWS FOR SOME ESCAPING OF AIR AND IN THE MIDST THROUGH THE HOLES RIGHT HERE
h2dZglgVX3I_10 0 SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BECOME A SUFFOCATING TYPE OF EXPERIENCE
gNEb3wpOYhI_1 0 SO A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T GET INVOLVED WITH SEEDS SAVING BECAUSE THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF CROSS POLLINATION OR THEY THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOU WERE SEED
gNEb3wpOYhI_2 0 AND WELL PEOPLE ARE USED TO GO INTO THE STORE OR TRUSTING THE IF DORDIES FOR THEIR FOR THEIR MATERIALS IN RESOURCES
gNEb3wpOYhI_3 0 HOWEVER I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT TODAY THAT YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO BE SO CONCERN ESPECIALLY IN THE BACKYARD GARDEN
gNEb3wpOYhI_4 0 FOR A B C COMPANY IF YOU GET OFF TYPES SAVE A BEAD OR A CHORD THAT COULD BE A DISASTER BECAUSE THEY'RE RELYING ON THE ADVERTISING AND THE CLAIM OF YOUR SEAT
gNEb3wpOYhI_5 0 HOWEVER IN THE BACKYARD GARDEN IF YOU GET A FEW YELLOW BEATS WITH YOUR PINK WORMS ARE A FEW A PINK CARROTS WITH YOUR ORANGE ONES THAT MAY NOT BE LIABILITY IT MAY IN FACT BE A BLESSING
gNEb3wpOYhI_6 0 WHEN YOU THROW THE JEANS INTO PLAY WHETHER IT'S WITH THE SQUASH OR THE TOMATOES YOU SOMETIMES COME UP WITH SOME MIRACULOUS RESULTS
gNEb3wpOYhI_7 0 SO I'M NOT GOING TO READ ABOUT THE SQUAT CAN HOWEVER HOW DO YOU THINK SOME OF THESE REMARKABLE VARIETIES EVOLVED
gNEb3wpOYhI_8 0 ORIGINALLY NICE EVOLVED OUT OF THE ON THIS SELECTED CROSS IS THE RANDOM CROSSES I SHOULD SAY OF GENETIC MATERIAL WHICH CERTAIN PEOPLE BACK IN HISTORY FOUND DESIRABLE INTERESTING BEAUTIFUL OR TASTY
gNEb3wpOYhI_9 0 AND IT THE THEY WERE SPECIAL ENOUGH FOR THEM TO SAVE AND TO PRESERVE
gNEb3wpOYhI_10 0 SO AGAIN WHILE IT'S IMPORTANT TO OBSERVE THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF PURITY AND SELF POLLINATION VERSIONS CROSS POLLINATION JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO ISOLATE OR HAND POLLINATE YOUR CROSS-POLLINATE IN CROPS DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN TRY GROWING THEIR SEE
gNEb3wpOYhI_11 0 AND YOU CAN ALWAYS DO A TEST AND IF YOUR TEST SHOWS THAT YOU'VE GOT WHAT YOU WANT TO HIT OR SOMETHING THAT'S DESIRABLE NONE THE LESS WELL THAT'S INTERESTING AND IT MIGHT EVEN YIELD SOME REMARKABLE RESULTS
gxwT5v4wbfQ_1 0 HI MY NAME'S JOE

gxwT5v4wbfQ_5 0 NOW WHAT MAKES IT SO DIFFICULT IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE TO ELEVATE THE INTERVIEW CUE STICK IF YOU DO NOT HIT DEAD CENTER ON THE BALL WHATEVER ENGLISH IS THAT YOU WILL ACCIDENTALLY PUT ON THE CUE BALL WILL MAGNIFIED BECAUSE IT'LL BE A SLIGHT MASS SAY SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HIT THE CENTER OF THE BALL OR IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON USING THE ENGLISH TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALLOW FOR IT
gxwT5v4wbfQ_6 0 YOU HAVE TO MAKE A BRIDGE THAT UP ON YOUR FINGERTIPS ARE SO THAT YOU'LL BE OVER THE BALL
gxwT5v4wbfQ_7 0 YOUR CUE STICK WILL BE ELEVATED IN THE BACK THAT WHICH YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WILL MASS SAY A BALL IF YOU PUT ANY ENGLISH ON

Gj1vLHzky9c_17 0 ONE GOES ONE WAY ONE GOES THE OTHER WAY
GQ1RQefuOao_1 0 SO NOW I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FINAL EDITOR IN CELTX

GQ1RQefuOao_4 0 ADDING AND OF COURSE FOR YOU KNOW IT CORRECTLY FORMAT SCREENPLAY THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT
GQ1RQefuOao_5 0 SO THAT'S GREAT THAT CELTIC SAYS THAT BECAUSE IT'S JUST BASICALLY A FREE SCREENWRITING SOFTWARE
GQ1RQefuOao_6 0 BUT YOU ALSO MAYBE JUST NEED TO WRITE SOME REGULAR TACK SO THEY DO OFFER A TEXT EDITED DISAPPOINTING TEXT EDITOR
GQ1RQefuOao_7 0 YOU SEE IT'S RIGHT HERE UNDER THE SELECT ITEM OPTION AND I'VE ALREADY GOT ONE OPEN FROM THEIR ON EXAMPLE
GQ1RQefuOao_8 0 AND IT'S JUST ON ANY KIND OF PLAYING ALL TEXT YOU NEED TO DO THIS IS WHAT THIS WOULD BE GOOD FOR
GQ1RQefuOao_9 0 IN THIS EXAMPLE THEY'RE USING IT AS A A STORY OUTLINE AND YOU CAN SEE THERE'S ALSO YOU'VE GOT THE NOVEL JUST RIGHT IN THERE
GQ1RQefuOao_10 0 SHAKE CORRECT STORY ON
GQ1RQefuOao_11 0 THE TEXT EDITOR OPTIONS ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT SIZE WANT TO SHOW YOU THE IS
GQ1RQefuOao_12 0 OF COURSE YOU NO LONGER HAVE YOUR SCENE NAVIGATOR DOWN HERE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO SCENES
GQ1RQefuOao_13 0 THIS IS PLAYING TEXT AND YOU NO LONGER HAVE YOUR TABS DOWN HERE FOR ALL THOSE OPTIONS BECAUSE IT'S JUST POINT TEXT
GQ1RQefuOao_14 0 BUT YOU DO HAVE SOME MORE OPTIONS IN YOUR TOOL BAR
GQ1RQefuOao_15 0 THERE IS A LOT MORE FONTS INCREASING THE FONT SIZE RIGHT HERE A FUNK COLOR AND THEN SIMILAR TO THAT JUST REGULAR STUFF ON DO AND REDO CUT SEE COPY AND PASTE
GQ1RQefuOao_16 0 AND THEN YOU HAVE A FINDING REPLACE AND A TRICK SPELLING AND ANOTHER OPTION
GQ1RQefuOao_17 0 AND THEN YOU HAVE A STANDARD BOWL TO TUCK UNDER LINE AND THEN WE'LL BE DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER THERE'S A STRIKE THROUGH
GQ1RQefuOao_18 0 YOU STILL GET YOUR ALL CAPS AND LOWER CASE
GQ1RQefuOao_19 0 YOU CAN FINELY JUSTIFY HOWEVER YOU WANT
GQ1RQefuOao_20 0 YOU CAN ALSO MAKE BULLETS OR NUMBERED LIST AND THEN THERE'S SOME INDENT OPTIONS
GQ1RQefuOao_21 0 SO THIS IS GREAT FOR JUST ANY KIND OF A KIND OF LONG DOCUMENT NEW IT'S ABOUT YOUR PROJECT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE
GQ1RQefuOao_22 0 AND LIKE I SAID IT'S A GOOD PLACE FOR SOMETHING LIKE A STORY OUTLINE OR MAYBE A A SYNOPSIS OF THE PLOT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
GQ1RQefuOao_23 0 SO THAT IS THE TEXT EDITOR IN CULT
hFJLCCFmEPs_1 0 SO WHENEVER I'M DONE TONING FOR THE DAY YOU NOW ONE OF THE HARDEST PART ABOUT DOING THIS STUFF ON YOUR OWN NOT IN A CLASSROOM AROUND OTHER PEOPLE'S THAT I CAN KIND OF WHATEVER I WANT
hFJLCCFmEPs_2 0 AND SO IT'S REALLY EASY FOR ME TO JUST NOT WANT TO CLEAN UP
hFJLCCFmEPs_3 0 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S A REALLY BAD HABIT TO GET INTO AND IT REALLY WON'T GET ANYWHERE
hFJLCCFmEPs_4 0 SO I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO DISPOSE OF MY BLEACH AND MY SEPIA AND I'M JUST GOING TO GET SOME BROWN JUG
hFJLCCFmEPs_5 0 BECAUSE I'M GOING TO USE THESE AGAIN I ONLY PRINTED ON A COUPLE PRINTS THE GUYS TODAY
hFJLCCFmEPs_6 0 SO I'M GOING TO DISPOSE OF THEM
hFJLCCFmEPs_7 0 NEVER JUST GOING TO DUMP THEM ON THE GRASS OKAY
hFJLCCFmEPs_8 0 THAT'S THE ONE THING YOU DON'T EVER WANT TO DO THAT MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE
hFJLCCFmEPs_9 0 THE OTHER THING IF YOU HAVE KIDS OR ANYBODY DO NOT JUST WALK AWAY FROM THESE
hFJLCCFmEPs_10 0 NO MATTER HOW TEMPTING IT MAY BE
hFJLCCFmEPs_11 0 YOU REALLY NEVER KNOW WHICH IS MAY COME OUT OF CURIOSITY TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE UP TO ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY BAD SITUATION ON YOUR HANDS IN NO TIME
hFJLCCFmEPs_12 0 THIS STUFF IS POISONOUS
hFJLCCFmEPs_13 0 SO AGAIN I'M GOING TO PUT THESE BACK TO TO BROWN JUGS SEE THEM UP AND USE AND AGAIN THE NEXT TIME I PRINT
hFJLCCFmEPs_14 0 THE COFFEE YOU CAN JUST THROW AWAY FROM
Hdxe01nmLRI_1 0 I'VE I HIT IT MIGHT TEE SHOT BUT I'M ON AN UPHILL LIE OR A BALL THE BALL IS ABOVE MY FEET
Hdxe01nmLRI_2 0 SO ON MY NEXT SHOT THIS WILL PRODUCE A HOOK
Hdxe01nmLRI_3 0 NOW THAT I'M USING A MID IRON HERE
Hdxe01nmLRI_4 0 THE LOWER THE LOFT MORE SIDE SPIN YOU GET
Hdxe01nmLRI_5 0 SO NOW THIS BALL IS GOING TO HOOK MORE THAN MY SAND WEDGE OR PITCHING WEDGE WILL
Hdxe01nmLRI_6 0 SO I HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT
Hdxe01nmLRI_7 0 SO I'VE ALONG YOUR SHOT
Hdxe01nmLRI_8 0 I HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HOOK
Hdxe01nmLRI_9 0 THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO PRACTICE THESE SHOTS BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO KNOW HOW MUCH A BALL HOOKS WHEN YOU SWING ON THE PRACTICE RANGE BEFORE YOU HAVE TO DO IT ON THE GOLF COURSE
Hdxe01nmLRI_10 0 BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T COUNT FOR PROPERLY YOU CAN END UP IN THE ROUGH FOR THE TREES OR WHO KNOWS WHERE
Hdxe01nmLRI_11 0 SO THE BALLS ABOVE MY FEET
Hdxe01nmLRI_12 0 I'M GOING TO STEP INTO IT I'M GOING TO LINE UP AT MY TARGET AND THEN I'M GOING TO AIM TO THE RIGHT A LITTLE BIT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HOOK
Hdxe01nmLRI_13 0 BECAUSE THE BALLS ABOVE MY FEET IF I DON'T ACCOUNT FOR THE CONTOUR OF THE OF THE SLOPE HERE I CAN SWING RIGHT INTO IT
Hdxe01nmLRI_14 0 PLUS NOW THAT I'M USING A LONGER IRON I HAVE TO ALSO ACCOUNT FOR THAT
Hdxe01nmLRI_15 0 SO IT TAKES A BIT OF PRACTICE TO GET THIS SHOT
Hdxe01nmLRI_16 0 SO YOU WANT TO LINE UP YOU WANT TO GET A NICE STANCE AIM A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF YOUR TARGET AND THEN TAKE A NICE EASY SWING
Hdxe01nmLRI_17 0 BECAUSE WITH THE HOOK YOU'RE GOING TO GET MORE DISTANCE
Hdxe01nmLRI_18 0 SO THAT'S HOW YOU PLAY ON THE LONGER IRON WHEN THE BALL IS ABOVE YOUR FEET
gn_A32VBRDo_1 0 AND SO WE'RE GOING TO WORK IT UP THE ARM TO THE BICEP AREA HERE AND HERE WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS JUST YOU KNOW SOME NICE GENTLE MASSAGING ON THE TRICEPS THE BACK OF THE ARM

hhGh_JV4bT8_10 0 THE SEDIMENT YOUR MATERIAL THAT'S COLLECTED OVER TIME AND THAT'S JUST WITH THIS IS SO
hhGh_JV4bT8_11 0 BUT IT'S IT'S GOT A DIFFERENT COLORATION TO IT AND IT'S GOT THAT STICKY A PLASTIC KIND OF FEEL THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR OUT OF THE CLAY BODY SO
hhGh_JV4bT8_12 0 THERE'S A LOT OF ORGANIC MATTER HERE
hhGh_JV4bT8_13 0 WE USE IN TWIGS AND I HAVE TO CUT THROUGH A BUNCH OF ROOTS AND THINGS TO GET DOWN IN HERE SO
hhGh_JV4bT8_14 0 I'M GOING TO TRY AND AVOID AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE GETTING THAT EXPERIENCE CRAP INTO THE CLAY SO I HAVE LESS TO CLEAN OUT BUT IT'S KIND OF INEVITABLE AND THEN AFTER I DID SOME OF THIS OUT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO CLEAN OUT THAT EXTRANEOUS MATERIAL AND PREPARE IT FOR TESTING AND USE YOUR CERAMIC WORK
GiTiHPq8avg_1 0 ONE OF THE FUNNY THINGS I REMEMBER THIS IS WHEN I WAS WORKING AT A NEWSPAPER AND KENTUCKY
GiTiHPq8avg_2 0 I HAD I HAD MADE A PRODUCTION IN THE IN THE FRIDAY NEWSPAPER THAT THIS PARTICULAR SCHOOL THAT I COVERED AT THAT TIME IS GOING TO LOSE THE NEXT DAY OUT SATURDAY
GiTiHPq8avg_3 0 AND THEY WERE PLAYING A TEAM THAT THAT REALLY WAS BETTER THAN THEM AND ONCE THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS IN THE GAME IS EVEN ON THE ROAD FOR THE SCHOOL IS COVERED
GiTiHPq8avg_4 0 SO YOU KNOW EVERY FRIDAY I MAKE MY PRODUCTION OF THE PAPER AND I SAID THAT YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THAT TO THE STEAM THAT I COVER WAS GOING IT WAS GOING TO GET BEAT
GiTiHPq8avg_5 0 SO THE TEAM I COVERED ENDS OF WINNING THE GAME AND I COME OUT AND ON MY KALLMAN MONDAYS PAPER AND SAYING I GUESS I HAVE TO EAT CROW BECAUSE I WAS WRONG AND I'VE MET IT
GiTiHPq8avg_6 0 I GO TO THE I GO TO THE COACHES UP PRESS LUNCHEON ON TUESDAY AND HE COMES OUT WITH A JOB WITH A PLASTIC CROW LAY IT ON A PLATE WITH A FORK A KNIFE OR MAY NEED TO EAT THESE GOT COVER WITH THE NAPKIN HE PULLS THE NAPKIN OBVIOUSLY I LIKE TO PRESENT THIS THE BREAD
GiTiHPq8avg_7 0 AND IN FOR KIND OF DO THIS IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY HANDS ME THIS CROW PLASTIC OR A LAY ON A PLATE LIKE IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GROW
GiTiHPq8avg_8 0 I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT
GiTiHPq8avg_9 0 IF I WAS FUNNY
GiTiHPq8avg_10 0 NOW I'VE BEEN ANY PROBLEM WITH IT
GiTiHPq8avg_11 0 IT WAS GOING TO GET A SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT THE FACT THAT NOT PICK THE STEAM TO WIN
GiTiHPq8avg_12 0 SO THAT WAS ONE THAT THAT'S UP THAT I STILL REMEMBER IT'S ON MY FRIENDS I STILL TALK ABOUT
GiTiHPq8avg_13 0 THAT WAS A GOOD MOMENT
GiTiHPq8avg_14 0 ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY LIKE MOST ABOUT BEING A SPORTSWRITER I THINK IS THAT IS THAT IT'S A IT'S A DAILY CHALLENGE FOR ME AND IN THE IN WORKING HERE IN NASHVILLE TENNESSEE YOU YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO READ WHAT I WRITE
GiTiHPq8avg_15 0 SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF FOR IS A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE THAT COMES WITH THAT
GiTiHPq8avg_16 0 BUT ALSO LOVE THE CHALLENGE OF A BECAUSE I LIKE THE FACT THAT I NEED TO PRODUCE SOMETHING THAT IS FACTUALLY CORRECT AND AN INTERESTING ENOUGH FOR THESE PEOPLE WANT TO PICK UP AND READ NOT ONLY TO MORE WITH THE NEXT DAY THE NEXT IN THE NEXT DAY
GiTiHPq8avg_17 0 SO EACH DAY IT'S KIND OF A CHALLENGE TO CRAFT SOMETHING TO PUT IT TOGETHER AND MAKE IT INTERESTING
GiTiHPq8avg_18 0 IT IS SOMETIMES IT'S A LITTLE DAUNTING WHEN IT'S ELEVEN O'CLOCK AND YOU'VE GOT A THIRTY MORE MINUTES TO FINISH YOUR DEADLINE TO MAKE YOUR DEADLINE BUT ALSO REALLY LIKE THE CHALLENGE OF THAT

g4ELdKhdOWQ_9 0 STEP LEFT STEP HIP STEP HIP STEP
g4ELdKhdOWQ_11 0 GOOD AND LET'S TAKE IT STEP TOUCH STEP TOUCH
g4ELdKhdOWQ_12 0 SO YOU'RE KIND OF JUMPING FROM ONE STEP TO THE NEXT
g4ELdKhdOWQ_13 0 STEP BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE BOUNCING DURING YOUR HIP LIFT
g4ELdKhdOWQ_14 0 I'M GOING TO BALANCE AND STAY IN PLACE
g4ELdKhdOWQ_15 0 STEP HIP STEP HIP STEP HIP
g4ELdKhdOWQ_16 0 SO A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENTS OKAY BUT YOU DON'T WANT A WHOLE LOT OF EXTRA MOVEMENT
g4ELdKhdOWQ_18 0 SO LET'S CHANGE THE ARMS
g4ELdKhdOWQ_19 0 THE SITE MEDIUM TO FIRE HEP AND THEN SWITCH
g4ELdKhdOWQ_20 0 FORWARD STEP STEP
g4ELdKhdOWQ_22 0 STEP HIP STEP HIP
g4ELdKhdOWQ_23 0 KEEP THE ELBOW BACK

_H3cEyCU1FM_1 0 HELLO I AM MARKS SIEBEL OWNER AND LEAD TRAINER OF DOGGY STEPS DOG TRAINING
_H3cEyCU1FM_2 0 IN THIS NEXT SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT AGILITY AND THE TUNNEL OBSTACLE
_H3cEyCU1FM_3 0 THE ORIGIN IN THEORY OF THE TUNNEL IS AN EXERCISE WHICH REQUIRES THE DOG TO GO THROUGH A CONFINED SPACE
_H3cEyCU1FM_4 0 TUNNELS ON AVERAGE ARE ANYWHERE BETWEEN TEN TO THIRTY FEET LONG AND TWO FEET WIDE
_H3cEyCU1FM_5 0 YOU CAN SEE THE TUNNEL BEHIND ME
_H3cEyCU1FM_6 0 FOR MOST DOGS AT FIRST IT IS A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE EXERCISE OBSTACLE BUT WITH PRACTICE ROUTINE AND REPETITION THE DOG WILL MASTER THIS EXERCISE
_H3cEyCU1FM_7 0 AS FAR AS LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY THE TUNNEL WILL WRITE A MORE DIFFICULT EXERCISE BASED ON THE CONSTRUCTIVE NATURE OF THE DOG HAVING TO GO THROUGH A CONFINED SPACE
_H3cEyCU1FM_8 0 THE GOAL OF THE TUNNEL WILL BE TO HAVE YOUR DOG BE BALANCED WITH SPEED AND MOVEMENT TO GET THROUGH THE TUNNEL AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
_H3cEyCU1FM_9 0 IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO LINE THE DOG UP FROM THE PREVIOUS AND POST OBSTACLES TO ENSURE THEY HAVE A CLEAR RUN THROUGH

gZvUB6APsx0_8 0 AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PROCEED TO GO AROUND LIKE THIS HALF THE HEAD FROM THE EAR TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEAD THIS WAY
gZvUB6APsx0_10 0 NOW FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT YOU KNOW STEADY AND HAVE FEAR OF JUST LOSING ALL THE HAIR YOU CAN CLIP IT RIGHT BY THE EAR RIGHT HERE
gZvUB6APsx0_12 0 THEN YOU TAKE THE OTHER PART OF THE HAIR BY HOLDING YOUR HAND HERE OKAY AND IF YOU WERE HOME YOU HOLD IT HERE AND YOU TRY TO GET AROUND THIS REALLY DIFFICULT TO TRY YOUR BEST
gZvUB6APsx0_13 0 BUT IF THE DISHES DOING IT SHE CAN JUST GO AROUND THE HAIR LIKE THIS HOLDING IT HERE ALSO BRING IT AROUND AND JUST IS VERY SOFT AND OR AFTER IT GETS DOWN SO YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE YOUR TIME TAKE YOUR TIME
gZvUB6APsx0_14 0 SOMETIMES I HAVE TO GO AHEAD AND WE DO IT AGAIN I CAN JUST BE NUTS BECAUSE IS DROPPING

H7kbHukjb60_1 0 SO YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF YOUR FISH AND THE MORE YOU NEED TO LEAVE YOUR MOVING OUT OF TOWN DON'T TAKE YOUR FISH DOWN TO THE NEAREST RIVER CREEK
H7kbHukjb60_2 0 YOU MAY THINK YOU'RE DOING EVERY THE FISH YOUR FAVOR GIVING THEM A NICE BIG COMB BUT IN REALITY YOU COULD ACTUALLY BE HEARD IN THE EQUAL SYSTEM OF THAT AREA
H7kbHukjb60_3 0 I'M BRUCE WITH ARCHITECT TROPICAL IN AUSTIN TEXAS
H7kbHukjb60_4 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR FISH WHEN YOU CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THEM ANYMORE
H7kbHukjb60_5 0 THE FIRST THING TO DO IF YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND TO KEEPS FISH ASK THEM IF THEY CAN TAKE THEM
H7kbHukjb60_6 0 IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS WHO ARE KEEPING FISH TO COME BACK TO THE STORE OR YOU'VE GOTTEN FROM
H7kbHukjb60_7 0 CHANCES ARE THEY'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE THEM OFF YOUR HANDS AND MAY ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A LITTLE MONEY BACK
H7kbHukjb60_8 0 PROBABLY NOT AS MUCH AS YOU SPENT BOTTOM BUT EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS
H7kbHukjb60_9 0 THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO IS JUST DUMP IN YOUR FISH IN THE NEAREST CREEK
H7kbHukjb60_10 0 ALL THAT REALLY ACCOMPLICES IS INTRODUCING OF SPECIES TO THAT IN THE RIVER SYSTEM THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE
H7kbHukjb60_11 0 MAYBE IT'LL DOES A TEMPERATURE WILL BE RIGHT WATER CONDITIONS WILL BE RIGHT BUT MAYBE A LIVE MAYBE IT'LL THROTTLE EIGHTH MAYBE IT WILL BECOME THE SNAKE KIDS OF MARYLAND
H7kbHukjb60_12 0 YOU HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR THESE KIND OF THINGS
H7kbHukjb60_13 0 SO THAT'S THE PROPER WAY TO READ HOME YOUR FISH
H7kbHukjb60_14 0 UNTIL NEXT TIME I'M BRUCE WITH LUCK WITH THAT
HhlWUEbHBUk_1 0 THE DRINK WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE IS CALLED A BACARDI VOLCANO
HhlWUEbHBUk_2 0 AND FIRST THING WE'LL DO IS PUT SOME ICE IN A GLASS HERE AND WE WILL DO ONE SHOT OF OR I'M SORRY I'M GOING TO DO BELIEVE IT OR NOT A FULL HALF A GLASS OF ONE FIFTY ONE
HhlWUEbHBUk_3 0 SO I'LL FILL THAT UP AND THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH ONE FIFTY ONE TO A REALLY SET UP A VOLCANO AND WE'LL MIX IN HALF A GLASS OF COLA IT AND IT'S GOING TO MIX THIS UP HERE ALSO DO THE JUICE OF HALF OF A LIME SO IF YOU JUST GRAB A FEW LIME WEDGES AND SQUEEZE THOSE IN
HhlWUEbHBUk_4 0 IT'S GOING TO THROW THE WHOLE WEDGE IN THERE
HhlWUEbHBUk_5 0 THERE WE GO AND MIX THAT UP AND LAST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS GO AND POUR THIS IN THE GLASS AND WE'RE GOING TO FLOAT OR SOME EVER CLEAR ON TOP WHICH IS GOING TO BE AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE PROOF AND CAN GO ALL THE WAY UP TO A HUNDRED EIGHTY PROOF SO IF YOU FLOAT THAT ON TOP OF FULL SHOT AND WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THIS IS IF YOU WANT YOU CAN LIGHT THAT ON FIRE AND FIND SOME WAY OF DRINKING IT
HhlWUEbHBUk_6 0 THAT'S BACARDI VOLCANO BOTTOMS UP
GwCV7S-_LQY_1 0 IN THIS STEP WILL BE PUTTING THE BINDING ON
GwCV7S-_LQY_2 0 HOWEVER THE FIRST STEP IN THE BINDING PROCESS WOULD BE TO EVEN UP THE EDGES OF YOUR QUILT
GwCV7S-_LQY_3 0 SO WITH THE ROTARY CUTTER AND YOU'RE CUTTING MAT AND YOUR RULER YOU WOULD EVEN ALL THE EDGES OF THE QUILT
GwCV7S-_LQY_4 0 THE NEXT STEP IN THE PROCESS WOULD BE ACTUALLY MEASURING YOUR QUILT SO YOU GET THE CORRECT LENGTH OF THE BINDING
GwCV7S-_LQY_5 0 NOW DEPENDING ON HOW YOU SO MAY DEPEND ON THE SIZE OF THE QUILT
GwCV7S-_LQY_6 0 IN THE CASE OF OUR LITTLE OUT FOR PATCH THAT WE DID HERE IT'S THIRTEEN BY TWENTY FIVE
GwCV7S-_LQY_7 0 THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO FIGURE THE LENGTH OF YOUR BINDING
GwCV7S-_LQY_8 0 NOW THE WIDTH OF THE QUILT AND THE LENGTH OF THE QUILT IF THEY'RE THE SAME IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH SIDE THAT YOU PICK
GwCV7S-_LQY_9 0 THEN THE CASE OF MY SMALL PIECE I HAVE HERE I HAVE ONE SIDE THIS THIRTEEN INCHES AND ONE SIDE THIS TWENTY FIVE INCHES
GwCV7S-_LQY_10 0 SO WE'LL CUT TWO PIECES OF BINDING THAT OR TWENTY FIVE INCHES LONG BY FIVE INCHES WIDE
GwCV7S-_LQY_11 0 AND THEN TWO PIECES OF BINDING THAT ARE FIFTEEN INCHES LONG BY FIVE INCHES WIDE
GwCV7S-_LQY_12 0 THE REASON THAT THEY WOULD BE FIFTEEN INCHES IS BECAUSE WE NEED TO EXTEND THE NEXT TWO INCHES ON EITHER SIDE TO CONNECT WITH THE CROSSWISE BINDING
GwCV7S-_LQY_13 0 ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE BINDING AND THE FILLER YOU ACTUALLY NEED THE SAME SIZE PIECE THE FILLER AS YOUR BINDING JUST PLACE THAT ON THE INSIDE AND PRESS IT
GwCV7S-_LQY_14 0 AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO FOLD YOUR BINDING IN HALF
GwCV7S-_LQY_15 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO PRESS IT SO WE HAVE A NICE EVEN PIECE OF BINDING ALL THE WAY ALONG HERE

hjqEo6E6H4w_11 0 I MEAN YOU MIGHT BE A BROKEN AND CARE INJECTION PROPERTIES IN THERE SHE IS CHECKS PROPERTY
hjqEo6E6H4w_12 0 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A HUGE BUNKER
hjqEo6E6H4w_13 0 WHAT THE BROKER THAT I CHOSE I CHOSE BASED ON A NUMBER OF REASONS AND IT'S VERY INTERESTING
hjqEo6E6H4w_14 0 I DID MY DO DILIGENCE UNDER RESEARCH OR BY NATURE

G6iHQkic6Ug_1 0 HERE'S THE DRESS THAT I'M WEARING IT SLIGHTLY BELOW ABOVE MY KNEE
G6iHQkic6Ug_2 0 AND IT GOES VERY WELL WITH THESE BOOTS WITH THE KNEE HIGH BOOTS
G6iHQkic6Ug_3 0 WHICH CAN BE FLIPPED OR CAN BE WORN OUT
G6iHQkic6Ug_4 0 IF I WANT TO SHOW MORE OF MY LEGS OF CORE ALGAL DOWN WITH THESE ROOTS I'LL BRING THEM DOWN JUST LIKE THAT
G6iHQkic6Ug_5 0 IF I'M NOT SHY ABOUT MY TOLL LEGS THIS IS HOW WILL WEAR IT
G6iHQkic6Ug_6 0 HOWEVER I CAN HAVE A VARIATION AND OF COURSE NOT BEING SHY ABOUT MY LEGS I CAN WEAR IT UP
G6iHQkic6Ug_7 0 JUST ADD SOME STYLE TO IT
G6iHQkic6Ug_8 0 ALSO THIS DRESS IS A VERY WELL FIT WITH THESE PARTICULAR SHOES WITH THIS TYPE OF SHOES OR ANY KIND OF SHOES WHICH HAVE A LITTLE HEEL
G6iHQkic6Ug_9 0 SO YOU CAN GO WRONG IF YOU WEAR A SHORT ADDRESS AS A TALL WOMAN WHAT THE SHOES WHICH HAVE A LITTLE HEEL
gIU-VuKqGgA_1 0 SO A BIG PART OF PLAYING THE PITCHER YOU DO IS YOU'RE BREATHING TECHNIQUE IT'S A HUGE PART OF IT AND
gIU-VuKqGgA_2 0 THERE'S A FEW BREATHING EXERCISES THAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU BEFORE YOU REALLY EVEN BEGIN TO PLAY BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO KIND OF PUT YOU ON THE RIGHT PATH FOR DOING IT
gIU-VuKqGgA_3 0 THERE'S A VERY SPECIALIZED TECHNIQUE WITH THE DISH REDO CALLED CIRCULAR BREATHING WHICH WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT LATER
gIU-VuKqGgA_4 0 IT'S ONE OF THE MORE ADVANCED TECHNIQUES BUT THESE ARE SOME VERY SIMPLE ONES THAT YOU CAN DO JUST TO GET STARTED
gIU-VuKqGgA_5 0 THE EXERCISE IS THIS
gIU-VuKqGgA_6 0 WE'RE GOING TO DO A PATTERN WHERE YOU BREEZE IN FOR FIVE COUNTS AND BREATHE OUT FOR FIVE POUNDS VERY SLOWLY
gIU-VuKqGgA_7 0 VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO BREATHE IN THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND OUT THROUGH YOUR MOUTH LIKE THIS
gIU-VuKqGgA_8 0 IN THROUGH THE NOSE OUT THROUGH THE MOUTH
gIU-VuKqGgA_9 0 IT'S GOOD TO DO THAT ABOUT TEN OR TWELVE TIMES BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO PLAY
gIU-VuKqGgA_10 0 I STILL DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD WAY TO TO WARM UP AND TRY TO GET FOCUS TO GET IN THE RIGHT MODE FOR PLAYING
gIU-VuKqGgA_11 0 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO WHICH WILL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE AMOUNT OF AIR THAT YOU CAN FIT INTO YOUR LUNGS IS TO THINK IN TERMS OF GOING FROM THE BOTTOM UP
gIU-VuKqGgA_12 0 THAT'S THE WAY THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO GET THE BIGGEST BREATH OF AIR INTO YOUR LUNGS
gIU-VuKqGgA_13 0 IF YOU TAKE A BREATH FROM UP HERE IN YOUR CHEST LIKE LIKE THAT YOUR SHOULDERS TO RISE UP AND IT'S NOT REALLY GREAT FOR YOUR TECHNIQUE IS ACTUALLY NOT THE BEST WAY TO GET THE LARGE BREATH
gIU-VuKqGgA_14 0 IF YOU THINK OF THROWING FROM THE BOTTOM UP YOU SHOULD EVEN FEEL YOUR STOMACH MOVING OUT LIKE
gIU-VuKqGgA_15 0 JUST LIKE FILLING UP A GLASS OF WATER
gIU-VuKqGgA_16 0 BREATHING INTO THE NOSE OUT THROUGH THE MOUTH
gIU-VuKqGgA_17 0 WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT ABOUT TEN OR TWELVE TIMES TO WARM UP
gIU-VuKqGgA_18 0 IF YOU FIND YOURSELF GETTING KIND OF LIGHT HEADED OR OR DIZZY JUST OFFER A COUPLE OF MINUTES THEN GO BACK AND TRY IT AGAIN
gIU-VuKqGgA_19 0 THE IDEA IS THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE ANYTHING FORCED ABOUT YOUR READING
gIU-VuKqGgA_20 0 YOU SHOULD FEEL VERY RELAXED LIKE YOU'RE BREATHING
gIU-VuKqGgA_21 0 IF YOU'RE GETTING LIGHTHEADED YOU'RE PROBABLY JUST BREATHING TO HEAVILY TRY TO FORCE MUCH AIR IN AND OUT
gIU-VuKqGgA_22 0 TRY THAT TEN OR TWELVE TIMES IN YOUR GOT YOURSELF A PERFECTLY SET UP TO ACTUALLY PLAY THE INSTRUMENT

GC7KP61ReoQ_9 0 THEY DON'T GET TO DRAW A PICTURE UNTIL THEY FINISH WRITING THAT'S KIND OF THE ROLL IT'S LIKE A REWARD AT THE END
GC7KP61ReoQ_10 0 HAVE THEM ALWAYS PUT START OUT BY PUTTING THEIR NAME AND DATE
GC7KP61ReoQ_11 0 BUT THIS TIME IS TO BE TEACHING THEM HOW TO WRITE THE DATE

GiSBTBfnZUY_1 0 AS I MENTIONED THE PROJECT IS BEEN INTRODUCED WOOD TURNING
GiSBTBfnZUY_2 0 THAT IS PROBABLY HAVE TO SOME OF THE MOST IMPACT ON BEGINNING TURNERS
GiSBTBfnZUY_3 0 GETTING STARTED IN THE CRAFT HAS BEEN TURNING PANS
GiSBTBfnZUY_4 0 AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THIS
GiSBTBfnZUY_5 0 FOR ONE THING IS FAIRLY EASY TO GET IN THE PAN TURNING WITHOUT SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY
GiSBTBfnZUY_6 0 HANDS ARE SMALL AND SO THEY CAN BE DONE ON A MINI LEAD LIKE FINISH
GiSBTBfnZUY_7 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET A FULL SIZE LAYS
GiSBTBfnZUY_8 0 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPANIES THAT PRODUCE SMALL LAYS LIKE THIS THAT USUALLY RETAILER IN THE THREE HUNDRED RANGE
GiSBTBfnZUY_9 0 AND THEY'RE EXCELLENT LAYS AND YOU CAN DO A LOT OF WORK ON
GiSBTBfnZUY_10 0 AS FAR AS THE PINS GO THEY OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY TO FAIRLY QUICKLY MAKE A FINISH PROJECT PRODUCT THAT IS USEFUL THAT PEOPLE ENJOY AND IT'S FUN TO MAKE
GiSBTBfnZUY_11 0 ANOTHER NICE THING ABOUT THEM IS YOU GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH SOME REALLY REMARKABLE MATERIALS

HcMF3dG1AHg_2 0 I'M CHEF RAINER WICKEL AND I'M HERE TODAY WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
HcMF3dG1AHg_3 0 WELL WE'RE ONTO OUR NEXT STEP IN MAKING THE INNER SCHNITZELS AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE GOING OVER THE INGREDIENTS THAT WE NEED TO COMPLETE OUR DISH
HcMF3dG1AHg_4 0 OF COURSE WE NEED THE PORK CHOPS AND WE GOT A COUPLE OF NICE THICK ONCE RIGHT HERE WHICH WE'RE GOING TO CUT UP
HcMF3dG1AHg_5 0 WE ALSO NEED FLOWER FOR DIPPING WE NEED BREAD CRUMBS AND WE NEED TO MIX
HcMF3dG1AHg_6 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE SEPARATELY IN THREE DIFFERENT BOWLS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DIP THE SCHNITZELS ON THEM AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO FRY THEM
HcMF3dG1AHg_7 0 THE BREAD CRUMBS BEING THE LAST THING THAT WE GET THEM AT
HcMF3dG1AHg_8 0 OF COURSE I ALSO LIKE TO USE GROUND PEPPER AND SEA SALT WHICH IS A PERSONAL PREFERENCE ON
HcMF3dG1AHg_9 0 NOW THE PEPPER ON THE SALT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE PUTTING INTO THE FLOUR MIXTURE BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BIND WITH THE SCHNITZELS AND IT'S GOING TO GIVE IT THAT REALLY GOOD FLAVOR
HcMF3dG1AHg_10 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO BE COOKING THE SCHNITZEL TODAY AND OLIVE OIL
HcMF3dG1AHg_11 0 NOW THE USUALLY A USUALLY WHEN COOKING SCHNITZEL SIDE YOU CAN EITHER COOKING IN OIL OR USUALLY THEY COOK THEM AND BUTTER TO BUT I'M CHOOSING OLIVE OIL TODAY BECAUSE IT'S A LOT HEALTHIER
HcMF3dG1AHg_12 0 IF YOU'RE COOKING AND BUTTER IT'S GOING TO BE EXTREMELY FAT MEAL
HcMF3dG1AHg_13 0 BUT THIS ALSO GIVES A LOT BETTER FLAVOR AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING WITH THAT
HcMF3dG1AHg_14 0 LASTLY WE HAVE A LOT
HcMF3dG1AHg_15 0 OKAY THE LEMON IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE AT THE END WHEN WE SURF THE SCHNITZEL
HcMF3dG1AHg_16 0 YOU ALWAYS PUT A SLICE OF LIME AND ON TOP OF THAT BECAUSE THEN WHEN YOU'RE SERVING THE SCHNITZEL YOU TAKE THAT LEMON AND SQUEEZE THE LEMON JUICE ALL OVER THE SCHNITZEL AND IT GIVES IT THAT ADDITIONAL TANGY FLAVOR AND THESE ARE BASICALLY ALL THE INGREDIENTS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE A WIENERSCHNITZEL
hahHzzWNo0w_1 0 SARAH HAUER HI
hahHzzWNo0w_2 0 I'M SARAH HAUER
hahHzzWNo0w_3 0 AND I'M SIG HAUER AND WE'RE PROFESSIONAL PRACTITIONERS OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE
hahHzzWNo0w_4 0 WE'RE HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
hahHzzWNo0w_5 0 SIG HAUER AND WELCOME TO OUR VIDEO
hahHzzWNo0w_6 0 PAIN IS THAT AREA WE'RE PROBABLY BEST KNOWN FOR
hahHzzWNo0w_7 0 TYPICALLY YOU KNOW THE MAJORITY OF OUR PATIENTS COME FIRST BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT SOME COMPLAIN ABOUT PARTICULAR PAIN
hahHzzWNo0w_8 0 OF COURSE AS WE LEARN ABOUT THE PATIENT THE PATIENT ACTUALLY LEARN AS A FEW THINGS ABOUT THEMSELVES THEY FIND THAT OTHER THINGS START TO GET BETTER AS WE TREAT THEM ABOUT PAINT
hahHzzWNo0w_9 0 BUT CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND PAIN THAT THERE WE HAVE DONE VERY WELL WITH THEM AND THEY ARE MORE THAN WHAT I'M GOING TO MATCH AND OF COURSE BUT THINGS LIKE MIGRAINE HEADACHES LOW BACK PAIN NECK PAIN JUST ABOUT ANY KIND OF HEADACHE PIANOS ARTHRITIS
hahHzzWNo0w_10 0 TMJ ARE
hahHzzWNo0w_11 0 IF IT HURTS WE CAN PROBABLY HELP WITH THAT
hahHzzWNo0w_12 0 TYPICALLY WE SEE FOR EXAMPLE WITH LOW BACK PAIN I SEE PEOPLE RESPONDING ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO ABOUT EIGHT TREATMENTS THAT THEY START TO RESPOND VERY WELL AND SHOW SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT
hahHzzWNo0w_13 0 ONE PARTICULAR CASE I CAN THINK OF WAS A GENTLEMAN A ABOUT SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD OF RETIRED SCHOOL TEACHER A HIS BACK AND GONE OUT
hahHzzWNo0w_14 0 USE VERY ACTIVE A EXERCISE A LOT THAT A LOT OF STRETCHING SO HE'S PRICES BACK ONE OUT
hahHzzWNo0w_15 0 SO ONE TREATMENT
hahHzzWNo0w_16 0 YOU KNOW AND QUITE HONESTLY YOU USUALLY TAKES A FEW TREATMENTS BUT THIS GENTLEMAN BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE SUCH GOOD KERATIN ITSELF IS VERY PHYSICALLY FIT ONE TREATMENT HERE RESPONDED VERY WELL AND THE BACK PAIN WHEN AWAY AND DID NOT REOCCUR AFTER THAT
GQefb82rktc_1 0 ONE OF THE EYE INTERESTING THINGS THAT I FOUND WITH WATER COLOR
GQefb82rktc_2 0 MY DEGREE ISN'T DRYING AND I'M VERY GOOD AT DRAWING BUT IT ALSO TAKES ME A LOT OF TIME
GQefb82rktc_3 0 AND THE MORE TIME IT TAKES TO PAINT A PAINTING THE LESS INCOME BASICALLY
GQefb82rktc_4 0 SO THE REASON I USE A PROJECTOR AND PROJECT THE IMAGE IS TO GET A LOT OF DETAIL IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME SO I CAN FOCUS ON THE PAINTING
GQefb82rktc_5 0 AND AS YOU'LL SEE ON THIS GUY ON THIS PIECE HERE WHICH I'VE ALREADY LAID OUT THERE'S A NUMBER OF VERY INTRICATE DETAILS ON THIS THAT WE'VE TAKEN ME IN EXTRAORDINARY EXTRAORDINARILY LONG TIME TO ACTUALLY PAINT
GQefb82rktc_6 0 SO AS AN EXAMPLE THE BRIDLE ON THIS HORSE
GQefb82rktc_7 0 THIS YOUNG LADIES MOTHER ACTUALLY MADE IT BY HAND
GQefb82rktc_8 0 THIS IS BEAD WORK
GQefb82rktc_9 0 AND ALL OF THE THE LEATHER WORK AND STUFF
GQefb82rktc_10 0 PEOPLE KNOW WHEN THAT'S IN CORRECT IF YOU DO THAT THEY KNOW IF ANY THINGS OUT OF PLACE WITH THE ANIMAL
GQefb82rktc_11 0 ANYTHING LIKE THAT
GQefb82rktc_12 0 SO BY PROJECTING YOUR IMAGE AND GETTING ALL THE TIGHT DETAIL GETTING THE EYES PERFECT GETTING THE PERSPECTIVE PERFECT
GQefb82rktc_13 0 THAT TAKES SOME OF THE WEIGHT OFF OF GETTING THE DRAWING RIGHT
GQefb82rktc_14 0 YOU CAN FOCUS MORE ON THE PAINTING
GQefb82rktc_15 0 YOU CAN EXPERIMENT MORE WITH TECHNIQUES AND YOU CAN CREATE MORE PAINTINGS THEN YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO OTHERWISE
-GSIhHwFs04_1 0 WILLIE AND JEAN ARE GOING TO HELP ME DEMONSTRATE A REALLY FUN POSE CALLED HEAVEN AND EARTH
-GSIhHwFs04_2 0 AND IN THIS PARTICULAR POSE WILLY'S GOING TO BE THE HEAVEN AND GINA IS GOING TO GET TO BE THE EARTH BECAUSE WE WANT TO SHOW YOU THAT IT ISN'T ALWAYS THE LARGER HEAVIER OR MALE PARTNER THAT'S ON THE BOTTOM TAKING THE WEIGHT

H-JhEXmhK2U_1 0 OKAY WE'VE ALREADY PUT OR STRIP OF DECORATOR PAPER ON AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO EMBOSS OF FLOUR ONE OF THESE BEAUTIFUL CHIPBOARD FLOWERS
H-JhEXmhK2U_2 0 I'M USING A LITTLE BIT OF CRAFT INK AND I'M USING A ONLY ORANGE COLOR
H-JhEXmhK2U_3 0 I WANT THIS FLOWER TO REALLY POP OFF THE PAGE
H-JhEXmhK2U_4 0 SO THE FIRST THING I'M GOING TO DO IS YOU CAN SEE I'M JUST DABBING MY CRAFT INK AND THE REASON WE'RE USING THE CRAFT INK IS BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S A THICKER INK AND IT WORKS VERY WELL WITH EMBOSSING
H-JhEXmhK2U_5 0 SO GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT A GOOD COAT AND ONCE IT'S COVERED
H-JhEXmhK2U_6 0 THESE ARE THE STAMPING SPOT YOU'LL NOTICE THESE ARE A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN THE REGULAR INK SIZE PADS
H-JhEXmhK2U_7 0 I LIKE THESE WERE DOING THESE KIND OF PROJECTS BUT THEY ALSO COME IN THE LARGER STANDARD SIZE STAMPING PAD
H-JhEXmhK2U_8 0 SO ONCE I'VE GOT MY INK ALL OVER IT I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PUT IT IN MY TRY AND I'M GOING TO POUR JUST A LITTLE BIT OF MY EMBOSSING POWDER ALL OVER IT AGAIN BY LITTLE BIT I MEAN COVER IT
H-JhEXmhK2U_9 0 GIVE IT A LITTLE SHAKE SO YOU CAN FIND IT AGAIN TAP IT OFF AND THEN I LIKE TO DUMP MY POWDER BACK IN AND I LIKE TO CLOSE IT UP BECAUSE IF I START WITH MY ON HEAT EMBOSSING TOOL SOMETIMES IT FLIES EVERYWHERE
H-JhEXmhK2U_10 0 SO THE NEXT THING I'M GOING TO DO IS JUST TAKE MY HEAT EMBOSSING TOOL AND START HEATING BOXING IT
H-JhEXmhK2U_11 0 YOU'LL SEE THE COLOR IF START TO POT HERE AND JUST A SECOND
H-JhEXmhK2U_12 0 YOU WANT TO HOLD IT ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO THREE INCHES AWAY THERE'S THE COLOR STARTING TO GO IF

H-JhEXmhK2U_16 0 THIS FLOWER IS GOING TO MAKE A GREAT ACCENT IF ON MY MOTHER STATE BOARD HERE
H-JhEXmhK2U_17 0 AND THERE YOU HAVE IT A BEAUTIFUL FLOWER BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE MORE STEP TO MAKE IT EVEN BETTER
gKnp9YoayJY_1 0 HI I'M MELINA AND WELCOME TO EXPERT VILLAGE
gKnp9YoayJY_2 0 TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A BEAUTIFUL NECKLACE OUT OF POLYMER CLAY
gKnp9YoayJY_3 0 IN THIS NEXT STEP WE'RE GOING TO ADD A CLOSURE YOUR NECKLACE
gKnp9YoayJY_4 0 BEFORE ADDING ANY CLOSURE YOU NEED TO CRIMP BEADS
gKnp9YoayJY_5 0 CRIMP BEADS ARE THE BEST INVENTION IN THE WORLD IN MY OPINION
gKnp9YoayJY_6 0 IT'S A GREAT WAY TO SEAL OFF ANY NECKLACE TO PREVENT THE CLOSURES FROM LOOSENING TO HOLD EVERYTHING INTO PLACE AND THEY'RE REALLY EASY TO APPLY
gKnp9YoayJY_7 0 ANYBODY CAN DO IT ALL YOU NEED IS A PAIR OF NEEDLE NOSE PLIERS
gKnp9YoayJY_8 0 THIS IS OUR CRIMP BEAD THERE'S OUR WIRE
gKnp9YoayJY_9 0 A WIRE IS GOING TO COME OUT OF THE SIDE AND WE'RE GOING TO ATTACH THE WIRE TO A CLOSURE
gKnp9YoayJY_10 0 I AND THE OTHER END OF THE WIRE IS GOING TO COME BACK INSIDE OF THE CRIMP BEAD
gKnp9YoayJY_11 0 THE CRIMP BEAD HAS A LITTLE SLICE RIGHT HERE IS ACTUALLY A CYLINDER AND YOU CAN SEE WHERE IT WAS SLICE TOGETHER
gKnp9YoayJY_12 0 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR NEEDLE NOSE PLIERS A AND WE ARE GOING TO SQUEEZE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CRIMP BEAD SO THAT A FOLDED IN HALF LIKE THIS
gKnp9YoayJY_13 0 AND YOU HAVE YOUR WIRE COMING OUT HERE AND THE CLOSURE RIGHT HERE
gKnp9YoayJY_14 0 ONCE THIS IS CLOSE YOU SQUEEZE IT TIGHT FOR CLOTHING COMES FLAT UP AND THAT WAY IT HOLDS THE WIRE INTO PLACE
G9iDjvQL_mQ_1 0 OKAY THE NEXT CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SCORING YOUR YOUR POINT SO YOUR BALLS TO TO MOVE FORWARD SO EVENTUALLY SINK THE EIGHT BALL WIN THE GAME
G9iDjvQL_mQ_2 0 ALRIGHT SCORING OCCURS WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR BALLS WHETHER THEY EITHER STRIPES ARE SOLID
G9iDjvQL_mQ_3 0 WE KNOW THAT IF YOU MAKE A LEGAL SHOT YOU GET TO SCORE AGAIN AND GETTING TO NEW TO KEEP PLAYING SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A SCENARIO WHERE I'M STRIPES AND THIS TWO BALLS LEFT THAT I'M STILL SHOOTING I COULD DO SOMETHING WHERE I CALL THE TWELVE BALL IN THE CORNER AND TRY TO STOP THE CUE BALL HERE BECAUSE AGAIN THESE ARE GOOD AS YOU LEARN FULL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN POSITIONING AND AGAIN THIS IS A DIFFERENT VIDEO WE ARE JUST LEARNING ABOUT THIS STRATEGY OF THE GAME AND TRY TO WIN THE GAME BUT ALL I WOULD MAKE THE TWELVE THE TEN AND NOW ALL MY BALLS ARE DONE
G9iDjvQL_mQ_4 0 NOW I'M AND CONTENTION TO WINNING THE GAME
G9iDjvQL_mQ_5 0 AGAIN SCORING THE BALLS IS WHEN YOU LEGALLY POCKET ALL OF YOUR BALLS WHETHER THEY BE THE STRIPES OR THE SOLIDS
G9iDjvQL_mQ_6 0 DON'T GET SCORING CONFUSED POINTS
G9iDjvQL_mQ_7 0 SCORING JUST MEANS THAT YOU HAVE YOU KNOW THE THE THE BALL THE SEVEN BALLS IN THE STRIPES ALL THE SEVEN BALLS IN THE SOLIDS
G9iDjvQL_mQ_8 0 SO IF THIS MIGHT BE SCENARIO WHERE I HAVE TWO BALLS LEFT IN THE EIGHT
G9iDjvQL_mQ_9 0 I'M TRYING TO GET THAT EIGHT BALL BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU WHEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE A LEGAL SHOT
G9iDjvQL_mQ_10 0 LET ME JUST SHOW YOU THE TWO LEGAL SHOTS THAT WOULD MAKE HERE ON THE TWELVE AND ON THE TEN BALL OF THE STRIPES
G9iDjvQL_mQ_11 0 I WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE BALL IN THE CORNER POCKET WHICH I WOULD MAKE A AND THEN I WOULD HAVE MYSELF IN A POSITION YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TRY TO PLAY POSITION IT'S ANOTHER VIDEO TAPE FOLKS GOOD I PUT MYSELF IN SUCH A POSITION THAT I COULD PLAY THE OF THE TIME BALL IN THIS CORNER AND MAKE MY CUE BALL COME OUT FOR A GOOD POSITIONING SHOT FOR THE EIGHT BALL AND WINNING THE GAME
G9iDjvQL_mQ_12 0 SO I WOULD SAY TEN BALL IN THE CORNER AND YOU SEE THE CUE BALL COMES OUT TO A POSITION ON THE TABLE WHERE I HAVE A NICE SHOT ANGLE SHOT FOR THE EIGHT BALL ON THE CORNER
G9iDjvQL_mQ_13 0 THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO ONE POCKETING YOUR BALLS LEGALLY AND SCORING ALL OF YOUR BALLS FIRST BEFORE YOUR OPPONENT DOES AND GIVING YOU A GOOD EXECUTION SHOT FOR WINNING THE GAME AND SHOOTING THE EIGHT BALL AND CLEAN
gwWmOiC6z4k_1 0 HI I'M JUDY CARRIER WITH JEWELS BY PARK LANE AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU HOW TO FIND OUT IF THE JEWELRY YOUR BUYING IS RAIL
gwWmOiC6z4k_2 0 THE BIG THING IS ASK FOR DOCUMENTATION
gwWmOiC6z4k_3 0 IF IT'S A STONE LET'S SEE IF THEY HAVE PAPERS OF CERTIFICATION OF TELLING YOU THE CARROT
gwWmOiC6z4k_4 0 IF IT'S A METAL LOOK FOR A STAMP
gwWmOiC6z4k_5 0 IF IT'S A GOLD OR SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE TEN CHARACTER OF TEN K FOURTEEN K SIXTEEN K T K TWENTY K ON UP TO TWENTY FOUR K WHICH IS PURE GOLD
gwWmOiC6z4k_6 0 YOU KNOW AND THAT IS USUALLY STAMPED IF IT'S A BRACELET IT'LL BE INSIDE THE BRACELET USUALLY OR A RING THAT WILL BE INSIDE A RING
gwWmOiC6z4k_7 0 ON A NECKLACE IT'S USUALLY UP BY THE CLASS
gwWmOiC6z4k_8 0 IF IT'S STERLING SILVER IT'S GOING TO BE STAMPED OF POINT NINE TO FIVE STERLING SILVER
gwWmOiC6z4k_9 0 THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE STAMPED ON ANY ITEM THAT STERLING
gwWmOiC6z4k_10 0 THE OTHER THING THAT YOU WANT TO DO TO MAKE SURE IT'S REAL IS OF THEM HAVE A TEST THE HABIT OF PRAISE BY SOMEONE WHO IS AN EXPERT IN THE FIELD
gwWmOiC6z4k_11 0 ANY REPUTABLE JEWELER WILL HAVE A WAND LIKE INSTRUMENT THAT TEST DIAMONDS
gwWmOiC6z4k_12 0 FOR INSTANCE WHAT I WOULD DO THOUGH TO MAKE SURE IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT YOUR PERSONALLY OR DON'T KNOW IS REPUTATION IS PERHAPS TAKE A PAIR OF A REALLY GOOD CUBIC'S OR CONE IT EARRINGS AND A HALF AND TEST THE EARRINGS
gwWmOiC6z4k_13 0 NOW IT SHOULD TURN FROM GREEN ALONG THE SIDE OF THE WAND SHOULD GO FROM GREEN TO READ IF IT'S REAL IF IT AND IT SHOULD BE
gwWmOiC6z4k_14 0 IF IT DOESN'T KNOW IF YOU DON'T GET A BEAT ON YOUR CUBIC'S ARE COMING UP BUT YOU DO GET A BEAT FOR INSTANCE ON YOUR RING AND THAT'S PROBABLY REAL
gwWmOiC6z4k_15 0 THAT'S ONE WAY OF TIME AND I WOULD MAKE SURE THEY TESTS SOMETHING LIKE THIS FIRST
gwWmOiC6z4k_16 0 THAT WAY IT WON'T JUST BE WHEN THEY WANT IT UP
gwWmOiC6z4k_17 0 FOR INSTANCE IF YOU'RE DOING PEARLS ONE WAY TO TEST IT IS RUB IT GETS YOUR TEETH
gwWmOiC6z4k_18 0 IT DOESN'T WORK FROM I HAVE FULL STEEP
gwWmOiC6z4k_19 0 HOWEVER THEY SAY ALL THAT IF IT'S SMOOTH IT'S PROBABLY FAKE
gwWmOiC6z4k_20 0 IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE ROUGHER FOR THE REAL PEARL
gwWmOiC6z4k_21 0 ALSO CHECK THE BORE OF THE HOLE
gwWmOiC6z4k_22 0 IT'S REAL PEARL HAS A VERY TINY BOARD BECAUSE THEY TRY TO MAINTAIN THE VALUE OF THE PEARL
gwWmOiC6z4k_23 0 IT'LL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN HOW THE WAIST
gwWmOiC6z4k_24 0 WE'LL PEARLS OR HEAVIER THAN SAKE
gwWmOiC6z4k_25 0 ANOTHER THING WILL BE THE WARMTH
gwWmOiC6z4k_26 0 NOW THE LAST PEARLS HOWEVER TAKE A LITTLE LONGER TO WARM UP IN YOUR HAND THAT ARE REAL PEARL
gwWmOiC6z4k_27 0 SO IT'S STILL A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE AN UPRIGHT
GbfVUIaWAew_1 0 THE FIRST THING YOU'RE GOING TO DO AND THE ACRYLIC APPLICATION IS JUST GO AHEAD WET YOUR BRUSH MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH BOTTOM OR ON THERE
GbfVUIaWAew_2 0 IF YOU NEED TO JUST WIPE IT OFF
GbfVUIaWAew_3 0 MAKE SURE THERE'S NOTHING STUCK OR LEFT OVER FROM BEFORE
GbfVUIaWAew_4 0 THERE IS JUST TAKE YOUR PAPER TOWEL AND WIPE IT OFF A LITTLE
GbfVUIaWAew_5 0 YOU'RE GOING TO GET A SCREW FOUR BALL OF ACRYLIC POWDER OUT AND APPLY TO THE NAIL
GbfVUIaWAew_6 0 IT'S IF YOUR NAIL HAS ENOUGH MONOMER AND WILL WET THE POWDER THAT DOESN'T YOU'LL NEED TO WIPE THAT ONE OFF AND START AGAIN
GbfVUIaWAew_7 0 JUST WANT TO PUT IN THE CENTER OF THE NAIL
GbfVUIaWAew_8 0 KIND OF PAT IT DOWN TOWARDS THE SIDES
GbfVUIaWAew_9 0 PUSH IT BACK TOWARDS THE TOP AND THEN PULL IT DOWN OFF OF THE NAIL ITSELF
GbfVUIaWAew_10 0 IF YOU HAVE EXTRA JUST KIND OF WIPE IT OFF
GbfVUIaWAew_11 0 YOU WANT TO GO AROUND THE CUTICLE WITH YOUR BRUSH JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A ONE SIXTEENTH OF AN INCH GAP SO THAT THE OR ACRYLIC IS NOT TOUCHING THE CUTICLE ITSELF
GbfVUIaWAew_12 0 IF YOU NEED TO GET A LITTLE MORE LIQUID AND POWDER
GbfVUIaWAew_13 0 PUT THE VERY TIP
GbfVUIaWAew_14 0 AND SMOOTH IT BACK
GbfVUIaWAew_15 0 WE'RE STARTING WITH THE RIGHT PINKIE NAIL
GbfVUIaWAew_16 0 NOW ONCE YOU'VE GOT YOUR ACRYLIC APPLY THE LOOK AT IT FROM THE SIDE AND YOU WILL LOOK AT IT FROM THE BOTTOM
GbfVUIaWAew_17 0 MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT ON THE CUTICLE
GbfVUIaWAew_18 0 MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A NICE C CURVE ON THE TOP AND IF YOU NEED TO APPLY A LITTLE MORE ANYWHERE YOU SEE FIT
GbfVUIaWAew_19 0 IT JUST KIND OF BLEND IT IN WITH THE REST
GbfVUIaWAew_20 0 AND THAT IS HOW YOU APPLY THE ACRYLIC TO THE RIGHT PINKIE NAIL
GbfVUIaWAew_21 0 AGAIN IF YOUR ACRYLIC IS TOO WET IT WILL RUN IN DRIP AND YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF AND START OVER
GLj7QwlHIKI_1 0 THE NEXT KNOT WE'RE GOING TO TIE IS THE UPRIGHT NOT IT
GLj7QwlHIKI_2 0 THIS KNOT IS USED FOR TIME TOGETHER LIKE FISHING LINES AND WHAT NOT A DIFFERENT DIAMETER
GLj7QwlHIKI_3 0 START YOU TAKE THE LARGER LINE AND CREATE A LOOP AND THEN YOU TAKE THE SMALLER LINES AND RUN IT THROUGH THIS WAY AWAY FROM THIS INTO THE LOOP OFF
GLj7QwlHIKI_4 0 AND YOU SIMPLY TAKE IT UP AND BEGIN WRAPPING AROUND
GLj7QwlHIKI_5 0 YOU WANT TO DO THIS SEVERAL TIMES LIKE EIGHT OR NINE
GLj7QwlHIKI_6 0 THAT'S A STROKE IS THE BIGGER THAN WHAT YOU ACTUALLY IS IT'S NOT FOR FOR I'M JUST GOING TO DO IT A FEW TIMES SO YOU GET THE IDEA
GLj7QwlHIKI_7 0 AND JUST WRAPPING AROUND THE WHOLE THING
GLj7QwlHIKI_8 0 KEEP THE STRIP ON THIS SIDE
GLj7QwlHIKI_9 0 TO FINISH IT OFF YOU GO OVER THE TOP YOU NOTICE HOW THESE ARE COMING OVER THIS WAY SIMILAR TO THE WAY THAT THE SQUARE KNOT WOOD
GLj7QwlHIKI_10 0 AND YOU JUST PULL IT DOWN AND TIGHTEN IT UP
GLj7QwlHIKI_11 0 THAT'S THE OUT RIGHT NOW
GGM9IPA8lzM_1 0 YOUR EDGES IN CORNER YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO THE SAME
GGM9IPA8lzM_2 0 PUSH YOUR MUDDY EACH OF IT SO IT FILLS UP BEHIND IT
GGM9IPA8lzM_3 0 A LITTLE CRACK IN THERE YOU ARE TRYING TO FILL THAT UP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
GGM9IPA8lzM_4 0 IF THAT HELPS ENJOY INTO THIS IS DR ALL TOGETHER
GGM9IPA8lzM_5 0 PRETTY MUCH IS GO OVER LIKE WE DID ON THE EDGE
GGM9IPA8lzM_6 0 FILLING IN WIDTH RUNNING A CRACKED PUSH TO MIND IN THERE FOR YEARS THING
GGM9IPA8lzM_7 0 IF YOU'RE IN EXPERIENCES THIS IT'S HARD TO GET SMOOTH IT FIRST BUT IF YOU KEEP WORKING WITH AN F HEALTH PRETTY SIMPLE YOU'LL GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU THIS UP IT WILL COME OUT REAL SMOOTH
GGM9IPA8lzM_8 0 I LIKE TO DO ON MY KWANZAA LIKE TO DO ONE SIDE TIME IF I'M USING WIDTH FORTY MINUTE NIKE IN IT AND IF I CAN DO IT BECAUSE THEN OF A LOT OF PEOPLE USE CORNER TRIAL AND I DO SOMETIMES BUT A LOT OF TIMES I DON'T SIMPLY BECAUSE I JUST HAVE TAKES A LOT OF TIME FOR ME TO STOP AND GRAB THE CORNER BEAD AND START USING AND ALL THAT
GGM9IPA8lzM_9 0 AS FASTER FOR ME TO GO BY HAND
GGM9IPA8lzM_10 0 AND IF I DO ONE SIDE HAND AND I LET IT SET I CAN KNOCK OFF THE BOTTOM SO MANY OTHER SIDE AND I DON'T GET THAT GROOVE THAT YOU WILL GET IF YOU WERE LIGHT PUT A COAT ON THIS SIDE RIGHT NOW
GGM9IPA8lzM_11 0 IF YOU WERE TO PUT A COAT ON THIS SIDE OF THE SAME TIME THEN YOU'RE BEING ARE POINTING YOUR KNIFE WOULD PRESS INTO THERE ON THE EDGE AND IT WOULD MAKE A GROOVE ALONG THE SIDE AND SOMETIMES MESSES UP YOUR CORNER A LITTLE BIT
GGM9IPA8lzM_12 0 SO WHEN I GET A CHANCE I'LL USE OF A JUST DO ONE SIDE AND THEN I'LL COME BACK AFTER THIS SIDE HARDENS NOT DO THIS THE OTHER SIDE LATER
GGM9IPA8lzM_13 0 EITHER WAY THOUGH IF YOU'RE CAREFUL AND NOW YOU WANT TO DO BOTH SIDES OF THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW YOU'VE STILL DO

g_sUCNtQYGE_5 0 IT WILL HOLD THAT IN A STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN POSITION
g_sUCNtQYGE_6 0 AND THIS IS A GOOD ONE FOR TAUGHT TO FIND THE CHEESE
g_sUCNtQYGE_7 0 SO ACTUALLY STRENGTHENING THAT ENERGY THAT LIFE FORCE THAT MOVES AROUND THE BODY AND MAKES MOTION EASY THAT KEEPS THE JOINTS FLUID AND THAT SORT OF THING
g_sUCNtQYGE_8 0 THIS IS GOING TO BE AGAIN A STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN WOULD BE BEST
g_sUCNtQYGE_9 0 IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT JUST MASSAGING UP AND DOWN THROUGH THIS AREA WITH THE TIPS OF YOUR FINGER WILL CATCH BOTH OF THOSE POINTS OF THE SAME TIME

g5xecnY9uOo_3 0 THE FIRST TYPE OF FIRE EXTINGUISHER IS A WATER BASED FIRE EXTINGUISHER
g5xecnY9uOo_4 0 THE WATER BASED FIRE EXTINGUISHER CAN BE EASILY IDENTIFIED BY THE SILVER CAN THAT IT COMES IN
g5xecnY9uOo_5 0 SOME OF ITS ADVANTAGES OR THAT IT ABSORBS LARGE AMOUNTS OF HEAT AND THE WATER IS READILY PLENTIFUL
g5xecnY9uOo_6 0 DRY CHEMICAL FIRE EXTINGUISHERS OR MULTIPURPOSE FIRE EXTINGUISHERS HAS A WORKING RANGE OF TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN FEET
g5xecnY9uOo_7 0 THE POWDER INSIDE THE EXTINGUISHER HAS THE CONSISTENCY OF BAKING FLOUR SOME OF ITS ADVANTAGES IS THAT IT IS AN INNER IT MATERIAL AND CAN BE USED ON ELECTRICAL FIRES
g5xecnY9uOo_8 0 THE THIRD TYPE OF FIRE EXTINGUISHER IS A CEO TO FIRE EXTINGUISHER OR CARBON DIOXIDE
g5xecnY9uOo_9 0 SOME OF THIS ADVANTAGES ARE THAT IT HAS A HIGH EXPANSION RATIO AND THAT IS NOT CONDUCTING

GEKysOs5UlA_2 0 IF YOU FOLLOW THE PREVIOUS STEP AND YOU FOLDED EVENLY THEN THE STRIPS SHOULD COME APART
GEKysOs5UlA_3 0 THEY SHOULD ALL BE EVEN THE SIZE AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO MATCH THEM UP AND WE'RE GOING TO ALTERNATE THE STRIPS FROM ONE PICTURE TO THE OTHER
GEKysOs5UlA_4 0 AND THEN AS WE PUT THEM TOGETHER IT'S GOING TO FORM LIKE AN ACCORDION SHAPE AND THEN WE'LL BE READY TO GLUE IT ONTO OUR SOLID WHITE SHEET OF PAPER
GEKysOs5UlA_5 0 SO ONCE WE HAVE TO LINE UP THE IMAGES GET ALL OF OUR STRIPS CUT AND THEN IT'S IMPORTANT TO OF COURSE TO KEEP IT ALL IN ORDER

HEXxfkdN5kc_2 0 WELCOME TO EXPERT VILLAGE
HEXxfkdN5kc_3 0 MY NAME IS WAYNE PETERSON AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE IMPORTANT BIRD AREAS PROGRAM FOR THE MASSACHUSETTS AUDUBON SOCIETY
HEXxfkdN5kc_4 0 TODAY WE'RE HERE AT THE DANIEL WEBSTER WILDLIFE SANCTUARY IN MARSHFIELD
HEXxfkdN5kc_5 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT BIRDING BY EAR
HEXxfkdN5kc_6 0 IN ADDITION TO SONGS AND CALL NOTES WHICH ARE VOCAL RENDITIONS VARIOUS BIRD SPECIES ALSO MAKE MECHANICAL SOUNDS
HEXxfkdN5kc_7 0 SOUNDS THAT ACTUALLY DON'T INVOLVE ANY KIND OF A PHYSICAL VOCALIZATION
HEXxfkdN5kc_8 0 THE DRUMMING OF A WOODPECKER ON A HOLLOW SNAG FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE OF THING
HEXxfkdN5kc_9 0 BUT THEY'RE OTHERS
HEXxfkdN5kc_10 0 FOR INSTANCE VARIOUS BIRDS ESPECIALLY SHORE BIRDS OFTEN GIVE DISPLAYS IN THE AIR WHERE THE SOUND PASSING THROUGH VARIOUS PARTS OF EITHER THEIR WINGS OR THEIR TAILS CAN PRODUCE PECULIAR SOUNDS
HEXxfkdN5kc_11 0 THE AMERICAN WOODCOCK FOR EXAMPLE IS A BIRD THAT WHEN IT TAKES OFF IT HAS THIS SORT OF SOFT LETTERING SOUND WHICH IS ACTUALLY MADE BY AIR PASSING THROUGH THE OUTER FLIGHT FEATHERS
HEXxfkdN5kc_12 0 SIMILARLY THE WILSON SNIPE WHEN IT'S DISPLAYING SPREADS ITS TAIL IN FLIGHT AND BASICALLY DOES A BRIEF FREEFALL WHICH CREATES THIS VERY PECULIAR WINNOWING SOUND
HEXxfkdN5kc_13 0 SOME OF THE GAME BIRD SOME OF THE CHICKEN LIKE BIRDS WILL OFTEN DISPLAY AND THEY'LL TAP YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND IN ADDITION TO MAKING VARIOUS GESTURES WITH THEIR WINGS THAT ARE OUR INTERESTING IN THIS REGARD
HEXxfkdN5kc_14 0 SO THERE ARE LOTS OF SOUNDS OTHER THAN STRICT VOCALIZATION THIS THAT CAN BE USED FOR SOME OF THE SAME FUNCTIONS THAT WE FIND IN TERMS OF TRUE SONGS AND CALLS

g77gf-Uy_-s_8 0 THE OTHER WAY TO THROW IS MORE PRACTICAL IN A FIGHTING SCENARIO WE'RE NOT GOING TO HOLD IT OUT WITH A FIRE AND RECOVER SO HERE'S WHAT LOOKS LIKE
g77gf-Uy_-s_9 0 NOW LET'S GO BACK TO THE SIDE KICK ON COME RIGHT AT YOU WITH THIS AND GET READY
g77gf-Uy_-s_10 0 I'M GOING TO BRING THE KNEE RIGHT UNDER MY BODY AND ONCE IT COMES ACROSS THIS FOOT HAS TO PIVOT HARD AND FOUR
g77gf-Uy_-s_11 0 IDEALLY IT'S GOING TO GO
g77gf-Uy_-s_12 0 ONE EIGHTY WAS AT ME
g77gf-Uy_-s_13 0 TOES ARE POINTED FORWARD NOW THE HEELS FACES YOU THAT'S A ONE EIGHTY PIVOT GOES ALL THE WAY AROUND
g77gf-Uy_-s_14 0 IT DOESN'T HAVE YOU WANT TO BE ONE SIXTY ONE SEVEN IS FINE BUT CHEAPER ONE EIGHTY
g77gf-Uy_-s_15 0 SO WHAT I'M DOING NOW IS GOING TO BRING THE KNEE ACROSS MY BODY AND THRUST IT STRAIGHT INTO YOU AS A BACK LEG SIDE KICK
g77gf-Uy_-s_16 0 I'M HITTING WITH THE HEEL FOR MOST BEGINNERS RATHER THE BRING IT ACROSS AND KICKING STRAIGHT OUT THEY WILL NOT GET IT ACROSS AIM THE SHIN AND HIP BONE OF SLOPPY ROUNDHOUSE KICK

HK7a25sxpbw_1 0 OKAY NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO STEEP TEA USING AND DIFFUSING BALL
HK7a25sxpbw_2 0 I AM IN THIS WHAT IS IN A BALL THAT TRADITIONALLY THIS TYPE OF APPARATUS WAS IN A ROUND SHAPE
HK7a25sxpbw_3 0 SO BASICALLY THIS IS A GREAT TOOL IF YOU'RE JUST GOING TO MAKE ONE CUP OF TEA FOR YOURSELF
HK7a25sxpbw_4 0 AND IT'S BASICALLY THIS MESH LITTLE HOPPER THAT THE T GOES IN AND THEN THE LID SCREWS ON LIKE THAT AND IT'S GOT THIS GREAT LITTLE CHAIN SO YOU CAN HANG IT INTO THE CUP AND WRAP THE CHAIN AROUND THE HANDLE SO YOU'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO PULL IT OUT WITH WHEN YOU'RE DONE
HK7a25sxpbw_5 0 SO FOR THIS I'M JUST GOING TO USE WHEN THEY WERE TO MAKE SOME GREEN TEA AND I'M GOING TO MEASURE OUT MY ONE TEASPOON OF GREEN TEA SINCE WE'RE ONLY MAKING ONE CUP AND I'M GOING TO PUT IT IN THE HOPPER GIVES ME
HK7a25sxpbw_6 0 SO THERE'S MANY TEA INSIDE AND THEN I'LL SCREWED ON AND IT MAY LOOK LIKE THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF TEA AND A LOT TO EMPTY SPACE IN HERE THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE WHAT LOOSE TEA NEEDS IS BASE FOR THE LEAVES TO REALLY EXPAND ON AS THEY TAKE ON WATER
HK7a25sxpbw_7 0 AND SO THAT'S IT THAT THAT CREATES THAT A TEA IN BAG DOESN'T REALLY OFFERS THAT EXTRA SPACE FOR IT TO MOVE AROUND
HK7a25sxpbw_8 0 SEE SCREW THE LID ON
HK7a25sxpbw_9 0 SINCE WE'RE DOING GREEN TEA WE'VE GOT WATER THAT SELL BOILING IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT LESS SOME BOILING
HK7a25sxpbw_10 0 BRIGHT TO A BOIL AND LET IT COOL DOWN A LITTLE BIT
HK7a25sxpbw_11 0 SO THE FILL UP ONE CUP WORTH OF WATER IN A MUD AND THEN SUBMERGE DIFFUSING BALL INSIDE THE CUP
HK7a25sxpbw_12 0 AND AGAIN MOST OF THESE HAVE A LITTLE A LITTLE HOOK RIGHT HERE SO THAT YOU CAN WRAP THE CHAIN AROUND THE HANDLE AND HOOK IT ONTO ITSELF SO YOUR CHAIN DOESN'T FALL INTO YOUR CUP
HK7a25sxpbw_13 0 SO SUNSCREEN TEAR LET IT SIT FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES AND THEN ONCE IT'S FINISHED WE PULL OUT OF ALL WE ARE GOING TO DRAIN
HK7a25sxpbw_14 0 I CAN OPEN IT DISCARD MY USE TEA LEAVES AND THEN RINSE IT OUT AND ENJOY THEM A CUP OF TEA
HATpkbud9m8_2 0 HI I'M AUSTIN SHEPARD HERE WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
HATpkbud9m8_3 0 TODAY I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU A GROOMING YOUR PLANT
HATpkbud9m8_4 0 YOU KNOW IF YOU JUST HAVE A PLANT TAKE CARE OF WRITTEN WATER IT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO LOOK THE BEST THAT I CAN
HATpkbud9m8_5 0 YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT INTO
HATpkbud9m8_6 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO GRAB A PLANT HERE ARE SOME TOOLS THAT YOU'LL NEED A PAIR OF SCISSORS OR SOME SORT OF CLOTH TO MAYBE WIPE OFF THE DIRT OF THE PLANT IF THERE'S A LOT OF DIRT CAKED ON AND A LITTLE FEATHER DUSTER BECAUSE SOMETIMES IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF PLANTS IN THEIR INDOORS ESPECIALLY IN THERE IF THEY'RE IN A PUBLIC PLACE THEY'RE GOING TO GET A LOT OF DUST ALL OVER THEM
HATpkbud9m8_7 0 SO ALL YOU DO SOMETIMES MAYBE ONCE A WEEK OR THE DUST IT OFF
HATpkbud9m8_8 0 IT'S REALLY EASY DOESN'T EVEN TAKE ANY THOUGHT WHATSOEVER I PUT A LAYER DUSTER I TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THE PLANT
HATpkbud9m8_9 0 IT LOOKS A LOT SHINIER NOW IT AND I'VE NOTICED A COUPLE YELLOW LEAVES
HATpkbud9m8_10 0 SO THIS IS A PRETTY SMALL PLANT TO BE DOING THIS ON
HATpkbud9m8_11 0 YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO CHOOSE A MUCH LARGER PLANT WITH A LARGER LEAF LIKE LET'S SAY THIS ONE AND YOU'RE GOING TO CUT OFF THE YELLOWING TIPS BUT YOU'RE GOING TO CUT THEM OFF IT AWAY THAT KEEPS THE PLANT LEAF SHAPE
HATpkbud9m8_12 0 SO YOUR CUT A LITTLE BIT OFF OF THIS SIDE AND A LITTLE BIT OFF OF THIS SIDE
HATpkbud9m8_13 0 LOOK AT THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THE PLANT IS BRAND NEW AND DRIVING
HATpkbud9m8_14 0 IT DOESN'T HURT THE PLANT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HELP THE PLANT BUT IT HELPS YOUR PIECE OF MINE
HATpkbud9m8_15 0 WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE PLANT IT DOESN'T HAVE YELLOWING LEAVES
_HGmlDEpq_g_1 0 HI MY NAME IS LAUREN WITH MAKEUP BY DODGE AND TODAY WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO MAKE YOUR FACE LOOK CENTER USING MAKEUP
_HGmlDEpq_g_2 0 I'M SURE A LOT OF YOU LADIES WANT TO KNOW HOW TO DO THIS AND IT'S VERY EASY
_HGmlDEpq_g_3 0 SO FIRST YOU NEED TO FIND CONTOURING MAKEUP
_HGmlDEpq_g_4 0 CONTOURING MAKEUP SOMEONE COLLET BRONZER
_HGmlDEpq_g_5 0 I PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE BRONZER BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT KNOWING REALLY HAS REDDER ORANGE TONES IN THEIR SKIN UNLESS THEY HAVE A DARKER COMPLEXION BUT AS LIGHT LIGHT LIGHT ALMOST PIGMENTED PIGMENT WITH LADIES HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE BROWN
_HGmlDEpq_g_6 0 SO I'LL TAKE THIS COLOR WHICH IS JUST A LITTLE BROWN AND I'M GOING TO SWEEP IT UNDERNEATH THE CHEEKBONES AND ON THE RIM OF THE FACE BY THE HAIRLINE AND BRING IT OUT TOWARDS THE CENTER OF THE FACE
_HGmlDEpq_g_7 0 THIS CONTOURING MAKEUP THIS POWDER SHOULD ONLY BE PUT ON WHEN YOU POWDER YOUR FACE ALREADY OR ELSE IT'S GOING TO BE BLOTCHY FROM THE FOUNDATION AND IT'S JUST GOING TO LOOK ELEMENTS
_HGmlDEpq_g_8 0 THE POINT OF THIS IS LIKE I SAID BEFORE IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOUR I THINK THAT IT'S RECESSING THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY EXIST AS CLOSE TO THE SURFACE AS IT REALLY DOES AND IF YOU PUT A LITTLE HIGHLIGHT IN THE CENTER OF THE FACE THAT WILL BRING THE CENTER OUT AND THE EDGES BACK TO YOUR FACE WILL BEST LOOK A LITTLE THINNER THAN IT REALLY IS
gcj62_Y5fHA_1 0 OKAY OUR NEXT SHOT ARE ON OUR THREE MOST BASIC CUE BALL POSITION SHOTS IS THE STOP SHOT
gcj62_Y5fHA_2 0 AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF ACTION DO WE NEED TO HAVE ON THE CUE BALL ON CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT BALL IN ORDER TO GET IT TO STOP
gcj62_Y5fHA_3 0 AND I'M JUST GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO BE LOOKING FOR ON EVERY STOP SHOT REGARDLESS OF DISTANCE IS YOU WANT TO BE TRYING TO CATCH THE CUE BALL IN ITS SLIDE
gcj62_Y5fHA_4 0 ANOTHER WORD THAT'S THE ACTION THAT WE REALLY WANT ON THE CUE BALL IS NO ACTION AT ALL
gcj62_Y5fHA_5 0 WE DON'T WANT IT TO HAVE ANY EXCESS FORWARD ROLL WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY EXCESS BACK SPINNER SIDE SPIN OR ANYTHING ELSE
gcj62_Y5fHA_6 0 WHAT WE WANT IT TO DO IS SLIDE INTO THAT BALL
gcj62_Y5fHA_7 0 BECAUSE IF IT SLIDES STRAIGHT INTO THE OBJECT BALL WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THE CUE BALL IS GOING TO IMPART ALL OF ITS ENERGY TO THE OBJECT BALL SENDING THE OBJECT BALL ON ITS WAY IN THE CUE BALL IS GOING TO LOSE EVERYTHING IT'S GOT GOING FOR AND IT'S GOING TO STOP DID STILL
gcj62_Y5fHA_8 0 SO FROM THIS POSITION RIGHT HERE IN ORDER TO SLIDE THIS BALL FROM THERE TO THEIR IT SHOULD BE A SIMPLE MATTER OF HITTING IT RIGHT AT THE CENTER
gcj62_Y5fHA_9 0 BECAUSE WHEN WE HIT IN THE CENTER THAT'S WHEN IT'S GOING TO SLIDE
gcj62_Y5fHA_10 0 AND ON A FAST CLOTH LIKE THIS IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE HIT RIGHT IN THE CENTER AND SLIDE ALL THE WAY OVER THAT BALL AND STOP
gcj62_Y5fHA_11 0 THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

GyWkuL_UjvE_3 0 I'M GOING TO SEE THE EAR BOW ARM IS MOVING OUT
GyWkuL_UjvE_4 0 SO YOU START A SMALL TRIANGLE AND THEN YOUR FOREARM IS MOVING DOWN TO REACH THE TIP
GyWkuL_UjvE_5 0 AND SO FOR THIS EXERCISE YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY ALL THE WAY THROUGH YOU JUST WANT TO KIND OF PRACTICE PLAYING A SMALL PART ON THE FROG AND PLAYING A LITTLE BIT AT THE TIP TO PRACTICE THAT MOVEMENT IN YOUR ARM MOVING FROM FROG UP TO THE TIP LIKE THAT
GyWkuL_UjvE_6 0 SO THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE PRACTICING FROG TO TIP

gpc-T2dm5Tk_6 0 WHAT WE'LL DO NOW IS BRING IT IN AND WE WANT TO CATCH IT RIGHT HERE ON IT WITH BETWEEN THE HEAD AND THE BODY WITH THE STAPLE
gpc-T2dm5Tk_7 0 SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO GO IN LIKE THIS AND WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STAPLE IS GOING TO CATCH ON THE CONSTRUCTION PAPER AND NOT THE TISSUE PAPER

HFbz10GyFs4_12 0 NOW THE PUREST WILL SAY NOW YOU MIGHT WANT TO BID FIVE BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS WITH SOMEBODY STOMPING THE THIRD ROUND OF HEARTS
HFbz10GyFs4_13 0 SO IF YOUR CONSERVATIVE PLAYER AND YOU WANT TO AIR ON THE SIDE OF BEING SAFE YOU COULD BID FOUR ON THIS AND PRETTY MUCH TAKE THAT TO THE BANK
HFbz10GyFs4_14 0 IF YOU'RE AN ACCURATE OR AGGRESSIVE PLAYER YOU WOULD SAY FIVE BUT THE RISK IS IS THAT IF YOU DO GET A BAD BREAK IN ONE OF THE SUITS THEN YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE A TRICK THAT YOU WILL COUNTING ON SO I WOULD SAY FOR THE NEWER PLAYER OR EVEN FOR THE EXPERIENCE PLAYER AS FAR AS BEING SAFE BEFORE BID HERE IS COMFORTABLE

h7NdXDJfE1k_3 0 THE OTHER PRO IS SOME PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME SAME THE CONTACT LENS WITH THEIR PUTTING IT IN OR IF IT DROPS THEY CAN'T SEE IT
h7NdXDJfE1k_4 0 IF YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS BAD ENOUGH MAYBE A CLEAR CONTACT LENSES TO CUT IT SO THE COLOR ACTUALLY HELPS YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE THE CONTACT LENS IN IS YOU KNOW IS IN RELATION TO YOUR EYE IS IT MAY BE EASIER TO PUT IN
h7NdXDJfE1k_5 0 THE CONS PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT THIS BUT LIKE I SAID BEFORE IT'S YOU KNOW THE SIZE THIS SIZE CAN BE LIMITING YOU KNOW
h7NdXDJfE1k_6 0 THE MAJOR DISTRIBUTOR OF CONTACT OF COLOR CONTACT LENSES IN THE WORLD ONLY HAS ONE SIZE OF CONTACT LENS AND IT'S LARGE
h7NdXDJfE1k_7 0 IT'S GOING TO TAKE YOUR IN A COVER YOUR WHOLE LIE
h7NdXDJfE1k_8 0 SO IT COULD BE SOME A NECESSARY MOVEMENT IT MAY NOT FEEL VERY GOOD AND YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO LIVE WITH THAT SO THEY CAN HAVE COLOR CONTACTS
h7NdXDJfE1k_9 0 THE OTHER THING IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS IF IT DOESN'T FIT PROPERLY THE CONTACT LENS MOVES AROUND WHICH HENCE BRINGS THE COLOR IN TO YOUR LINE OF SIGHT SO YOU'RE NOT SEEN IS CLEARLY AS YOU WOULD WITH A CLEAR CONTACT LENSES
h7NdXDJfE1k_10 0 OR MAYBE IF YOU DIDN'T NEEDED PRESCRIPTION WITHOUT ANY CONTACT LENSES AT ALL

hH-bIIEYcsE_3 0 YOU WANT TO HAVE A MAIN LIGHT SHOULD JUST TO ONE SIDE OF THE MODEL'S FACE THEN YOU WANT TO EITHER HAVE A SECOND LIGHT OR A BIG WHITE BOUNCE CARD TO BOUNCE A LIGHT BACK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MODEL SPACE
hH-bIIEYcsE_4 0 THEN YOU WANT TO HAVE WHAT'S CALLED THE HAIR LIGHT IT WILL BE AND AT THE BACK OF THE MODELS HEAD SO THAT THEY'RE HAIR STANDS OUT FROM THE BACKGROUND AND SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THE DEPTH OF THEIR HEAD ACTUALLY
hH-bIIEYcsE_5 0 AND OF COURSE YOU WANT TO HAVE ONE OR TWO LIGHTS ON THE BACKGROUND SO THAT THE MODEL STANDS OUT FROM THE BACKGROUND AND IS TO FIND AGAINST THE BACKGROUND AND YOU CAN DO SOMETHING INTERESTING WITH THAT AS WELL YOU CAN PUT A GEL ON THAT TO MAKE IT A DIFFERENT COLOR OR YOU CAN PUT A TEXTURED FABRIC UP ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING AND GIVE THE EFFECT THAT YOU WANT TO GET
hH-bIIEYcsE_6 0 AND THOSE ARE SOME PORTRAIT STUDIO LIGHTING TECHNIQUES
gDJZQybnkmg_1 0 HI THIS IS BRUCE LESSELS FROM ZOAR OUTDOOR ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE DOT COM TALKING ABOUT LOW AND LOW IMPACT CAMPING METHODS
gDJZQybnkmg_2 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE CAMPING IN AN AREA THAT GETS USED A LOT YOU WANT TO TRY TO RESTRING RESTRICT YOU'RE CAMPING ACTIVITY TO THE AREAS THAT ARE ALREADY CAMPED IN THAT ARE ALREADY BEEN DESIGNATED AS CAMPSITES
gDJZQybnkmg_3 0 IN THIS CASE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A CAMPSITE THAT'S THAT'S DESIGNATED AS SITE FIVE HAVE KIND OF A NICE CLEARLY LAID OUT AREA THAT'S THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR CAMPING AND YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR CAMPING ACTIVITIES THAT WITHIN THIS AREA AND NOT GO OUTSIDE THEM
gDJZQybnkmg_4 0 THE IDEA IS TO LIMIT THE IMPACT CERTAIN AREAS AND NOT ALLOW THE IMPACT TO GO TO GET TOO FAR OUT BEYOND THOSE AND THEREFORE START TO REALLY RUIN THE AREA AROUND IT
gDJZQybnkmg_5 0 AGAIN OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO USE THE SITE OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE A ENJOY THIS SAME EXPERIENCE YOU GET TO ENJOY AND SO ONE MORE HEAVILY USED AREAS TRY TO FIND AREAS THAT ARE ALREADY IMPACTED AND THAT ALREADY USED FOR CAMPING AND TRY TO RECAP IN THOSE AREAS RESPECTFULLY AND USE THEM AND I'VE BEEN A GOOD WAY AND HOPEFULLY WHEN YOU COME BACK THEY'LL BE AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO USE THE NEXT TIME
gNpN9jn6lAA_1 0 HI I'M KERRI AT ZEBRA IN BERKLEY AND I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT NOSE PIERCING IN THE HEALING PROCESS
gNpN9jn6lAA_2 0 WHEN YOU GET YOUR NOSE PIERCED INITIALLY THE PAIN IS PRETTY MINIMAL IT KIND OF ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE POPPING AS IT IN
gNpN9jn6lAA_3 0 THAT FIRST STAY YOU CAN NOTICE A TINY BIT OF BLEEDING AND A LITTLE BIT OF INFLAMMATION
gNpN9jn6lAA_4 0 THAT'S TO BE EXPECTING
gNpN9jn6lAA_5 0 AND DURING THE FIRST TWO WEEKS YOUR NOSE IS GOING TO SWELL UP SLIGHTLY ON THE INSIDE NO ONE'S GOING TO NOTICE
gNpN9jn6lAA_6 0 ONCE THAT SWELLING GOES DOWN YOUR JEWELRY MY MOVE AROUND A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE IT'S NOW LOOSER DO TWO MORE SPACE
gNpN9jn6lAA_7 0 AT THAT POINT YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO WANT TO GO SEE YOUR PIERCER AND HAVE IT ADJUSTED SO IT FITS A LOT MORE TIGHTLY
gNpN9jn6lAA_8 0 IF YOUR JEWELRY MOVES AROUND TOO MUCH FOR THE REST OF THE HEALING PROCESS IT COULD CAUSE IRRITATION AND THAT COULD RESULT IN AN INFECTION
gNpN9jn6lAA_9 0 SO IF YOU GO IN AND HAVE IT ADJUSTED YOU CAN AVOID ALL OF THAT
gNpN9jn6lAA_10 0 FOR THE NEXT FOUR TO SIX WEEKS YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO CONTINUE WITH A REGULAR AFTER CARE PROCESS WHICH CONSISTS OF CLEANING BOTH WITH AN ANTI BACTERIAL SOLUTION
gNpN9jn6lAA_12 0 AND ALSO SOAKING WITH SALT WATER
gNpN9jn6lAA_13 0 I CAN NOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT SOAKING WITH SALT WATER IS TO THE HEALING PROCESS AND KEEPING YOUR NOSE NICE AND HEALTHY
gNpN9jn6lAA_14 0 NOSE PIERCINGS HAVE A VERY HARD TIME HEALING BECAUSE THEY'RE CARTILAGE AND SO IF YOU'RE NOTICING A LITTLE BIT OF REDNESS OR TENDERNESS OR UNCOMFORTABLENESS IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY NORMAL ON
gNpN9jn6lAA_15 0 ALL IN ALL IT'S IT'S AN EASY PROCESSING COMPARED TO OTHER THINGS IN LINE BUT WITH THE NOSE PIERCING YOU SHOULD EXPECT THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO LOOK PERFECT UNTIL IT'S DONE HEALING
g4TswJ84cyE_1 0 ALRIGHT FOLKS IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO WRITE DOCUMENTARY
g4TswJ84cyE_2 0 RIDING SCRIPT FOR DOCUMENTARY IS NOT LIKE READING A SCRIPT FOR FEATURE FILM OBVIOUSLY
g4TswJ84cyE_3 0 THERE IS IN THE SAME SORT OF A NARRATIVE THREAD THAT STORY LINE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
g4TswJ84cyE_4 0 INSTEAD WHICH YOU HAVE IS THE IDEA OF THE WAY YOU WANT TO PRESENT THE WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU ARE DOCUMENTING WHETHER IT BE AN INDIVIDUAL OR AN EVENT THAT HAPPEN AT ONE POINT POINT OR ANOTHER OR AN ISSUE
g4TswJ84cyE_5 0 SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO IS FIRST OF ALL OUTLINED HOW YOU WANT TO DO THIS SO SIT DOWN IN FRONT OF YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN BLANK PAGE AND HAMMER OUT EXACTLY WHERE YOU WANT YOUR PRESENTATION TO GO WHAT YOU WANT TO COVER HOW YOU WANT TO COVER IT AND WHAT ULTIMATELY WHAT MESSAGE YOU WANT TO LEAVE WITH THE AUDIENCE SO DO THIS FIRST
g4TswJ84cyE_6 0 SECOND OF ALL MOST DOCUMENTARIES TODAY HAVE SOME DEGREE OF NARRATION OR SOMEONE THAT YOU'RE BASICALLY GUIDES AUDIENCE THROUGH THE PRESENTATION OR HOST WHATEVER THE CASE MAYBE SOMEONE IS ACTUALLY ON CAMERA GUIDING PEOPLE THROUGH A LOT OF TIMES IT WILL BE BOTH
g4TswJ84cyE_7 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SCRIPTED WORK FOR THIS PERSON SO THE NEXT STEP WITH THEN BE TO WRITE THIS PORTION OF DOCUMENTARY AND YOU WRITE THAT IS SAYING THAT WAY YOU WOULD A SCRIPT
g4TswJ84cyE_8 0 YOU HAVE BASICALLY YOU WRITE OUT EACH AND EVERY UPBEAT OF NARRATION AND THE CHUNK OF THE MOVIE THAT THAT PART APPLIES TO JUST DESCRIBE AND DURING THE SCENE WITH WHAT WOULD BE HAPPENING OR DURING THAT CHOCOLATE CHUNK OF A MOVIE WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHAT IT IS YOUR PRESENTING WHETHER IT BE YOU KNOW GRAPHICS A OLD ARCHIVE FOOTAGE YOU KNOW FOOTAGE THAT YOU'VE SHOT YOURSELF
g4TswJ84cyE_9 0 BASICALLY GET IT ALL WRITTEN DOWN AND THEN RIGHT THERE RATION AS YOU SEE FIT
g4TswJ84cyE_10 0 A LOT OF TIMES THIS PART OF THE PRODUCTION WILL BE DONE AFTER YOU'VE ACTUALLY COLLECTED ALL YOUR FOOTAGE
g4TswJ84cyE_11 0 MOST THE TIME WHEN YOU ARE PRODUCING A DOCUMENTARY YOU'VE ALREADY GOTTEN A BUNCH OF FOR THAT SHOT SO AS YOU'RE WRITING THE NARROW RATION YOU SORT OF HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF THE STORY THAT WE'RE ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE PRESENT INTO YOUR AUDIENCE
g4TswJ84cyE_12 0 SO AFTER YOU'VE COMPILED THE FOOTAGE AND YOU START TO MAKE A ROUGH CUT OF THE DOCUMENTARY THIS COULD BE WHEN YOU GO IN RIGHT THIS PORTION NARRATION THE STUFF THAT'S POST A COMPANY THAT FOR THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE
g4TswJ84cyE_13 0 SO A SORT OF AND CAUSE KNOWING THAT WE CUT THAT YOU HAVE DOWN ALREADY RIGHT OUT BASICALLY WHAT WE WILL BE SEEING THAT SECTION THE MOVIE AND A RIGHT UP THE CORRESPONDING NARRATION
g4TswJ84cyE_14 0 THIS IS REALLY THE BEST WAY TO WRITE A DOCUMENTARY

GoZxF1Soz3o_6 0 SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE SELLING THIS IN YOUR COMMUNITY PEEWEE CYLINDER FROM STAGE WHEN YOU PLAY PLACES YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK IT THE LIMITED PRESSING SCALE WHICH IS JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN DEMO SCALE PER PERSON
GoZxF1Soz3o_7 0 THE LIMITED PRESSING SCALE ALLOWS YOU TO SET UP TO TEN THOUSAND COPIES BEFORE YOU HAVE TO UPGRADE TO MASTER SCALE
GoZxF1Soz3o_8 0 TEN THOUSAND QUITE A FEW COPIES TO SELL FROM STAGE OR OUT OF THE TRUCK YOUR CAR
GoZxF1Soz3o_9 0 ONE OTHER SCALE THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER IS THE LOW BUDGET SCALE WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO SELL YOU KNOW AN LIMITED AMOUNT OF COPIES BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE LOW BUDGET APPROVAL BEFORE YOUR SESSION SO YOU HAVE TO SUBMIT A BUDGET TO THE MUSICIANS UNION FORTY EIGHT HOURS BEFORE YOUR SCHEDULE SESSION IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THIS
GoZxF1Soz3o_10 0 IT'S NOT MUCH MORE THAN LIMITER PRESSING YOUR DEMO SCALE BUT THAT WAY YOU CAN GO OUT AND SO AS MANY COPIES AS YOU WANT OF YOUR PROJECT

gQd3MWSR9Bk_13 0 THIS IS A CUT THE COMPANY THAT I'VE CHOSEN GREENISH OCCASION GREATS ENERGY TALKING AMONGST EACH OTHER ROLE PLAYING HOT NEXT IMPORTANT BUT LET ME TELL YOU THAT LET'S TALK A BUNCH OF MONEY
gyh0IEd0MxI_1 0 HAMMER CURLS ARE THE SISTER TOOTH THE BICEP CURL WHERE WE WOULD HAVE EVERYTHING LINED UP SUPINE TO YOUR BODY
gyh0IEd0MxI_2 0 ALRIGHT YOU WILL DO IS TURN SO YOU GOT YOUR THUMB TO THE SIDE MID LINE OF THE BODY JUST LIKE IF YOU'RE HOLDING ONTO A GOLF CLUB
gyh0IEd0MxI_3 0 BRINGING THE ELBOWS SLIGHTLY IN FRONT OF THE BODY SO OUR FOCUS IS GOING TO BE MORE FOR ARM
gyh0IEd0MxI_4 0 IT ATTACHES INTO THAT BY SET THAT TO HEADED MUSCLE BUT WE'RE REALLY GOING TO FOCUS ON MORE THE FOREARM WITH THIS AND CONTRACT AND RELEASE
gyh0IEd0MxI_5 0 NOW WITH VARIABLE TUBING RESISTANCE I'VE GOT RESISTANCE THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MOVEMENT COMING UP WITH MY CURL AND RELEASING COMING UP BOOM THERE'S PEAK CONTRACTION THERE'S REALLY NO NEED TO GO ANY FURTHER THAN THAT
gyh0IEd0MxI_6 0 I'M INVOLVING A LITTLE BIT OF THE TRUCK THE BICEP AS WELL BUT AGAIN YOUR FOREARM WITH THIS
gyh0IEd0MxI_7 0 JUST ELBOW SHOULDER IN LINE WORKING UNILATERAL
gyh0IEd0MxI_8 0 THE FURTHER AWAY I TAKE MY FOOT FROM THE BAND THE LESS RESISTANCE WILL HAVE WORKING TEN TO FIFTEEN REPS THREE SETS ON EACH SIDE
GnRztm2H_qc_1 0 I'M JUST HENNA ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND I'M TALKING WITH YOU ABOUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT IN THIS SEGMENT I'M GOING TO GO FOR SAFETY JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOUR BABY IS ABSOLUTELY SAFE AT ALL TIMES WHAT ARE GIVING HALF AND HERE SHE
GnRztm2H_qc_2 0 NOW ONE THING THAT I BRACELET GOT IS THIS LITTLE FAUCET COVER I'M IN INFLATES GOES OVER THE FAUCET AND THIS IS WHERE THE WATER COMES OUT OF THEM
GnRztm2H_qc_3 0 IT'S JUST KIND OF KEEPS THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO BUMP THEIR HEAD ON THE OPPOSITE
GnRztm2H_qc_4 0 THERE'S SOME KIND OF SHARP MIDDLE EDGES ON IT AND THEN JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN HE IS AN OLDER TODDLER THAT YOU NEED ON WHEN IT DOES HEAD AGAINST IT
GnRztm2H_qc_5 0 MAYBE USING ON A HAIR ON THE REACH OF THE CHORD AND I'M JUST GOING TO BE A PROBLEM TALLER AND TALLER
GnRztm2H_qc_6 0 OF OF YOUR EYE FIGURE AND THIS IS KIND OF MY PHILOSOPHY ON ALL CHILD FOR THING IS THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN PAY FIVE DOLLARS FOR SOMETHING TO MAYBE IT IS MARKETING JUST TO GET YOU BY MORE STUFF
GnRztm2H_qc_7 0 BUT I PERSONALLY THING BUT IF YOU CAN BUY SOMETHING FOR FIVE DOLLARS THAT THAT KEEPS YOUR BABY I'M HITTING THEIR HEAD ON SOMETHING GETTING STITCHES AND NOT TO ME IS MANY VERY WILL SPEND
GnRztm2H_qc_8 0 ONE THING THAT I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH IS THAT YOU NEED TO NEVER LEAVE THEM ALONE IN THE TONE
GnRztm2H_qc_9 0 THAT IS JUST YOU KNOW THERE IS NO WAY AROUND IT YOU CAN NOT LEAVE THEM ALONE IN THE TUB
GnRztm2H_qc_10 0 YOU CAN'T GO INTO THE PHONE INTO THE DOOR TO GET MORE SUPPLY IS ANYTHING LIKE THAT
GnRztm2H_qc_11 0 EVEN IF THEY ARE AND THE LITTLE BABY TOE TO
GnRztm2H_qc_12 0 BECAUSE ONCE YOU START ROLLING OVER THEY JUST FLIP OVER FLIP OUT OF IT AND ON THERE HAVE BEEN CASES WERE BABIES AFTER AROUND AND LESS THAN TWO INCHES OF WATER
GnRztm2H_qc_13 0 SO IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW LITTLE WATERY WHEN THEY'RE JUST ARE SURE THEY ARE CALLED AND WATER BECAUSE NOT A BAD
GnRztm2H_qc_14 0 ANOTHER THING IS THAT YOU NEED TO LOWER YOUR WATER TEMPERATURE FOR WATER HEATER DOWN TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DEGREES CELSIUS
GnRztm2H_qc_15 0 NOW I PERSONALLY I HAVE A VERY OLD SCHOOL WATER HEATER I JUST HAVE KNOBS UNTITLED ABC WITH A BEING THROUGH ONE OF THE POTS AND SEE IS HOTTEST
GnRztm2H_qc_16 0 SO I JUST HAVE MINDSET ON A THAT NOT EVERYBODY HAS WATER HEATER SLIDE
GnRztm2H_qc_17 0 THE YEARS MORE WATER AND YOU CAN PULL IT ACTUALLY SET IT ON ON DIFFERENT GREYS SO SO THAT AT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DEGREES CELLS THIS FOR LESS
GnRztm2H_qc_18 0 AND THIS IS SO THAT IF YOU NEED TO JUST POUR A LITTLE BIT MORE HOT WATER INTO THE BATH WALLET MAYBE ISN'T IT AND JUST KIND OF WARM BUT I YOU CAN DO THAT WITHOUT WORRYING OF A WATERING SO HOT FOR MITES GOLD
GnRztm2H_qc_19 0 ALSO WANT TO GET A LITTLE BIT OLDER AND START GETTING OUT THERE AND TRYING WASHER ON HANDS OR GET HURT THEM WATER AND THEN WE'LL ISLANDS' GOLD THEMSELVES ON WATER THAT'S TO THE POT
GnRztm2H_qc_20 0 ANOTHER THING THAT I LIKE TO DO IS I LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND FILL THE BATH BEFORE YOU GET TO THEM THAT WAY I CAN MAKE ABSOLUTE SURE THAT IT'S NOT TOO HOT
GnRztm2H_qc_21 0 SINCE I HAVE WATER HEATER SET CORRECTLY I KNOW THAT IT WAS CALLED AND UP AND IT IS TOO HOT BUT YOU KNOW I JUST DON'T WANT HIM TO GET BURNED EVEN JUST A LITTLE BIT

GoH5ZPL4-0s_9 0 AFTER THE BETTING ROUND THE PLAYERS WILL LOOK AT THEIR HANDS AND DECIDE WHICH THREE CARDS THAT THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO GET RID OF
GoH5ZPL4-0s_10 0 NOW THIS IS BASED ON WHETHER OR NOT THEIR HAND IS GOING TO GO FOR A LOW HAND OR HIGH HAND
GoH5ZPL4-0s_11 0 NOW IN THIS CASE THIS PERSON WOULD HAVE TO GIVE A THREE CARDS AND ACTUALLY BREAK UP A FLUSH THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE
GoH5ZPL4-0s_12 0 EACH PLAYER WOULD PAY THREE CARDS
GoH5ZPL4-0s_13 0 PASS THEM TO THE LEFT
GoH5ZPL4-0s_14 0 THERE'S THREE CHORDS YOU PICKED UP BY EACH PLAYER AND ANOTHER BETTING ROUND WILL START

GoH5ZPL4-0s_19 0 AND JUST FOR INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE SOME CARDS AROUND THE TABLE
GoH5ZPL4-0s_20 0 ONCE THE TWO CARDS HAVE BEEN PASS AND ON THE PLAYERS KNOW HAVE SEVEN CARDS AGAIN A BETTING ROUND WILL FOLLOW
GoH5ZPL4-0s_21 0 AFTER THAT BETTING ROUND IS PERSON WILL PAST ONE CAUSE IT TO THE PLAYER TO THE LEFT

hG8kZXxcNRk_7 0 THE DESIGNERS OF THAN THE EARLY SELLERS OF THEM CALL THEM SHARP GOT FIX
hG8kZXxcNRk_8 0 THAT WAS A RESURGENCE OF INTERESTED INTEREST IN GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE GOTHIC DESIGN AT THE TIME
hG8kZXxcNRk_9 0 SO THIS IS A OF A GOTHIC STYLE PERHAPS THE REMIND YOU OF A CHURCH OR A CATHEDRAL SO THE NAME STEEPLE CLOCK PERHAPS TO RIDE FAIRLY SOON AFTERWARDS
hG8kZXxcNRk_10 0 THE IT'S AN EYE CHRONIC AMERICAN STYLE OF CLOCK AND THE CONSTRUCTION WAS PRETTY SIMILAR
hG8kZXxcNRk_11 0 THE THING TO NOTICE IS THE THE EARLIEST ONES AT CONICAL CONICAL FINIALS
hG8kZXxcNRk_12 0 THESE ARE CALLED FINIALS NEALIS ONES ARE JUST THESE TURN CONES
hG8kZXxcNRk_13 0 LATER ON A THEY BEGIN BEING LAYS TURN LIKE THIS TO MORE COMPLICATED DESIGN

hG8kZXxcNRk_21 0 BUT WHEN THE VENEER IS THERE AND THEY'RE SHINED UP THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL CLOCKS BECAUSE OF THE MATCHING GRAIN AND THE QUALITY OF THE WOOD VENEER TO BEGIN WITH
hG8kZXxcNRk_22 0 OCCASIONALLY SEE WHERE SOMEONE'S CHEATED THE VENEER IS STARTING TO COME OFF
hG8kZXxcNRk_23 0 THEY JUST TAKE THE REST OF THE NEAR OFF STAIN UP THE CASE AND YOU HAVE BASICALLY A PINE STEEPLE CLOCK WHICH MAY LOOK PRETTY BUT DEFINITELY IS NOT DESIRABLE

gx6YmcpPRXw_6 0 SO FACE DOWN
gx6YmcpPRXw_7 0 SO ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS MOST COMMON WAY TO PEOPLE PLAY IS TO TAKE THREE CARDS OF THE TIME AND FLIP THEM OVER
gx6YmcpPRXw_8 0 NOW THE POINT IS TO GET ALL THE CARDS UP AT THE TOP BUT IN ORDER TO GET THEM AT THE TOP YOU NEED TO HAVE AN ACE
gx6YmcpPRXw_9 0 OTHER THAN THAT THE ONLY OTHER THE THE RULE IS THAT YOU CAN STACK CARDS IF IT IS THE OPPOSITE SUIT
gx6YmcpPRXw_10 0 OR THE OPPOSITE COLOR
gx6YmcpPRXw_11 0 SO FOR EXAMPLE BLACKJACK ON RED CLEAN
gx6YmcpPRXw_12 0 THEN YOU CAN SO THAT THE CARD UNDERNEATH
gx6YmcpPRXw_13 0 I'VE GOT A CHOICE HERE BETWEEN TWO TENS

gOGKEq4Gvt4_2 0 WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING A CURL STYLE ESPECIALLY IF YOUR HAIR STRAIGHT IN OR EVEN HAS A BIT OF A CURL WHERE YOU REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON YOUR BLOWING YOUR HAIR OUT IS YOUR ACTUAL VOLUME OF YOUR HAIR
gOGKEq4Gvt4_3 0 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO FOCUS SO MUCH ON BACK AND YOUR EAR AND STRAIGHT AND SMOOTH BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO BE GOING OVER IT WITH A CURLING IRON

gOGKEq4Gvt4_5 0 YOU GRAB A SECTION BUT I SUGGEST YOU DO IS YOU UTILIZE THE FACT THAT IT IS A THERMAL INSTRUMENT
gOGKEq4Gvt4_6 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO BRING IT UP TO THE BASE OF THE HEAD AND BRING IT DOWN
gOGKEq4Gvt4_7 0 NOW THIS DUCK WHIP YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GO WITH THE GRAIN
gOGKEq4Gvt4_8 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO TURN WITH IT IN ORDER FOR TO GO DOWN
gOGKEq4Gvt4_9 0 THEN YOU'RE GOING TO ROLL IT UP
gOGKEq4Gvt4_10 0 THE HEAT OF THIS IS AUTOMATIC WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A BIT OF SMOOTHNESS
gOGKEq4Gvt4_11 0 EVEN WITH NO PRODUCTS AND SHE STILL GETTING THE SMOOTHNESS
gOGKEq4Gvt4_12 0 NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE TEND TO GO THE OPPOSITE WAY AND THIS IS WHERE THE EXAMPLE IS

GSTw7LOhuhI_2 0 NOW GIVEN THAT THE COWS OR A LITTLE BIT CLOSE TO THE WHOLE THEY GIVE YOU PERMISSION I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS TIME TO DO WHAT WE CALL KIND OF PUSHING BACK
GSTw7LOhuhI_3 0 BECAUSE IF WE START OUT WITH THE COWS ALREADY THINKING ABOUT CUTTING ACROSS WE'RE GOING TO BE AT A GREAT DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY WILL THINK AND THEN THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE
GSTw7LOhuhI_4 0 SO WE'LL START OVER NOW AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO PUT TOGETHER THE KIND OF TEAMWORK THAT WOULD BRING US TO A VERY QUICK FINISH AND BE WITHIN THAT SIXTY SECONDS
GSTw7LOhuhI_5 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SAY FLAGS UP AND MY NUMBER IS ZERO
GSTw7LOhuhI_7 0 OH
GSTw7LOhuhI_8 0 FOR ONE OF THE PAN
GSTw7LOhuhI_9 0 FOR THREAD ON THE WALL FOR WHAT THREE UP WHAT THREE HAT AND THAT'S OK THAT'S A PLACE WHERE WE WOULD STOP AND TALK ABOUT HOW THE ONE IN FRONT OF THE THREE FOR US RIGHT NOW WOULD'VE BEEN A FUN WAY TO PLAY IT

GSTw7LOhuhI_11 0 WE'RE GOING TO PUSH HIM BACK CROSS AND WE'LL START OVER AGAIN AND HOPE THAT WE GET A GOOD ROUND
GUE6zOwZogY_1 0 ONE OF THE JUMP ROPE THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TODAY IS THE GENERAL PLASTIC WE CALL THE PLASTIC TYPE NYLON JUMP
GUE6zOwZogY_2 0 SO MOST OF THEM ARE EQUIPPED WITH LIKE A BALL BEARING TYPE SWIVEL AT THE VERY END SO THAT MAKES A LITTLE BIT FASTER AND THE JUMP ROPE ITSELF DOESN'T GET BALLED UP INSIDE THE HANDLE
GUE6zOwZogY_3 0 THESE ARE ALSO ADJUSTABLE IF YOU DECIDE THAT A NINE FOOT ONE IS TOO LONG FOR FOR YOUR AVERAGE BOXER MOST YOUR BOXERS
GUE6zOwZogY_4 0 YOU CAN ACTUALLY SHORTER BYPASSING BE THE JUMP GO BACK TO ITS THROUGH THE HANDLE ITSELF THERE'S USUALLY A NET ALREADY A WIRE COUPLING ON THERE THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY CUT AND THEN REATTACH SO YOU'LL GET A LITTLE BIT SHORTER JUMP ROPE
GUE6zOwZogY_5 0 WHICH IS SHOWING THE JUMP ROPE THAT'S A SHORT IS GOING TO BE AND THERE'S NO WAY OF LENGTHENING THEM

G5I3Jru9zAw_1 0 HI I'M HOLLY HEIDEMANN AND TODAY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE EQUIPMENT INVOLVED WITH BARREL RACING
G5I3Jru9zAw_2 0 THE NUMBER ONE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT I HAVE ALL THE CHILDREN AND YOUNG RIDERS PUT ON IS A HELMET
G5I3Jru9zAw_3 0 MANY PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT HELMETS BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT I MENTION NAMES BUT THERE'S SOME PEOPLE THAT HAVE SUFFERED FALZON HAD SOME REALLY SERIES INJURIES BECAUSE OF FALLING FROM A HORSE
G5I3Jru9zAw_4 0 A BEGINNER RIDER OR RIDER THAT'S INEXPERIENCED OR YOUNG RIDER SHOULD DEFINITELY WEAR A HELMET
G5I3Jru9zAw_5 0 AS YOU ADVANCE OR SOME PEOPLE CHOOSE NOT TO WEAR THEM THAT IS A CHOICE IT'S UP TO YOU BUT I LIKE ALL YOUNG RIDERS NOLEN EXPERIENCE RIDERS TO MAKE SURE THEY WEAR A HELMET
G5I3Jru9zAw_6 0 A HELMET DOES NOT PROTECT YOU FROM EVERYTHING YOU STILL HAVE TO USE REALLY GOOD COMMON SENSE
G5I3Jru9zAw_7 0 THE ONE THING THAT YOU WANT TO WATCH AS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FOOTING IN THE ARENA IS VERY GOOD THAT'S A SAFETY FEATURE
G5I3Jru9zAw_8 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE OF TAKING CARE OF THE GROUND
G5I3Jru9zAw_9 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE YOU KNOW WHERE THE GATE IS IF YOUR HORSE IS A FREE RUNNER THAT YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO STOP ONCE YOU GET OUT THE GATE
G5I3Jru9zAw_10 0 THERE ARE MANY SAFETY FEATURES INVOLVED IT ALL STARTS WITH THE HELMET
G5I3Jru9zAw_11 0 I RIDE THE SPURS
G5I3Jru9zAw_12 0 THIS IS A PRETTY HEAVY SET OF SPURS
G5I3Jru9zAw_13 0 YOU CAN HAVE ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF SPURS
G5I3Jru9zAw_14 0 SPURS A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE ARE TOO AGGRESSIVE AND EVEN ABUSIVE TO A HORSE
G5I3Jru9zAw_15 0 SPURS ARE ONLY ABUSIVE IF THE RIDER USES THEM THAT WAY
G5I3Jru9zAw_16 0 I LIKE TO USE SPURS IS AN EXTENSION OF MY LEG
G5I3Jru9zAw_17 0 VERY CAREFUL NOT TO GADGET HORSE
G5I3Jru9zAw_18 0 IT'S A TOUCH AND ALL IT IS IS TO MAKE THINGS VERY LIGHT FOR YOUR HORSE
G5I3Jru9zAw_19 0 YOU'RE NOT KICKING THE AIR OUT OF AND YOU'RE JUST USING THAT AS AN EXTENSION SO THEY CAN FEEL ALL OF YOUR CUES
G5I3Jru9zAw_20 0 THIS IS A CAT
G5I3Jru9zAw_21 0 THIS ON THIS IS BECOME ONE OF MY MOST FAVORITE PIECES OF EQUIPMENT
G5I3Jru9zAw_22 0 THE REASON WHY IS IT HOLDS I'M HORSE'S MOUTH CLOSED
G5I3Jru9zAw_23 0 IF YOU'VE EVER NOTICE WHEN YOU PULL ON YOUR HORSE AND A GOOD OPEN THEIR MOUTH YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY KIND OF CONTROL OUT OF THAT
G5I3Jru9zAw_24 0 THIS CREATES THEM NOT BEING ABLE TO DO THAT
G5I3Jru9zAw_25 0 SO MOST OF MY HORSES WHEN I'M DOING MY HORSEMANSHIP WHICH WE'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT I LIKE TO USE SOME KIND OF A RING SNAPPLE OR A D RING SNAPPLE MEANING THAT IT'S VERY CLOSE TO THE HORSE THE SIDES OF THEIR MOUTH WHERE THE CONTACT COMES WITH THE REINS
G5I3Jru9zAw_26 0 AND THEN THE MOUTH PIECE IS EITHER A TWO OR SOMETIMES A THREE PIECE MOUTHPIECE
G5I3Jru9zAw_27 0 THE OTHER THING I TALKED ABOUT WITH BAILEY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIS CONFIRMATION IS THAT HE IS A VERY SHORT IN IT
G5I3Jru9zAw_28 0 OKAY BECAUSE HE HAS A SHORT NECK HE HAS A TENDENCY TO ELEVATE HIS HEAD AND HIS TURNS
G5I3Jru9zAw_29 0 NOT TO THE POINT WHERE HE WOULD BE AROUND AWAY OR PROBLEM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT IT JUST DOESN'T GET IN QUITE A SNAP YOU TURN AS I WOULD LIKE AND SO THIS IS A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT CALM OVER THE POLE TIED DOWN
G5I3Jru9zAw_30 0 AGAIN I'M A BIG FAN FOR HORSES HAVE SHORT NEXT IS REALLY HELPS THEM
G5I3Jru9zAw_31 0 I DON'T RIDING IN THIS ALL THE TIME I ONLY RUN THE MINUTE
G5I3Jru9zAw_32 0 THE REASON WHY IS IT GOES OVER THEIR HEAD BEHIND THEIR EARS AND OVER THEIR EYES
G5I3Jru9zAw_33 0 AND WHAT THAT DOES IS WHEN THE ELEVATE THEIR HEAD IT PUTS PRESSURE ON IT AND BRINGS IT BACK DOWN
G5I3Jru9zAw_34 0 A HORSE THAT GETS US TO THIS NOSE IT'S THERE AND BAILEY WILL JUST KIND OF RUNNING KEEP HIS HEAD A LITTLE LOWER IT
G5I3Jru9zAw_35 0 HE RUNS MUCH MORE COMFORTABLY THAT WAY
G5I3Jru9zAw_36 0 IF YOU WERE TO WORK A HORSE AND THAT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT ALL THE TIME IT CAN MAKE THEM SORBER TIME YOU DON'T WANT THAT
G5I3Jru9zAw_37 0 SO I'VE AS SOON AS THEY KNOW IT'S THERE I GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT OFF WHEN I'M WORKING ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THEN JUST GO BACK TO USING IT WHEN I RUNS
G5I3Jru9zAw_38 0 AS FAR AS REINS GO I LIKE LEATHER REINS
G5I3Jru9zAw_39 0 ONE REASON THAT THEY'RE NICE IS THAT THEY FEEL REALLY GOOD IN YOUR HANDS
G5I3Jru9zAw_40 0 THE OTHER THING I LIKE ABOUT THEM LIKE THESE BRAIDED ONES BECAUSE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF FRICTION THEY'RE LIKE WHEN YOU PULL THE ARRANGE YOUR HAND IT DOESN'T PULL THROUGH
G5I3Jru9zAw_41 0 IT'S A NICE NICE SET OF REINS
G5I3Jru9zAw_42 0 I LIKE MY REINS FAIRLY SHORT
G5I3Jru9zAw_43 0 WHEN YOU RUN YOU'LL NOTICE THAT WHEN I GO TO WORK MY HORSE IN A FEW MINUTES
G5I3Jru9zAw_44 0 IF YOU'RE REINS OR NOT SHORT WHEN YOU GO TO TAKE THAT TURN AROUND THE BARREL WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE TOO MUCH FLAP EDGE ON THE OUTSIDE AND THEY CAN JUST KIND OF FADE AWAY FROM IT
G5I3Jru9zAw_45 0 SO IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT SHORT OF DRAINS
G5I3Jru9zAw_46 0 THIS IS THE OTHER PIECE OF EQUIPMENT TO USE ON MY HORSE
G5I3Jru9zAw_47 0 THESE ARE CALLED OVER EACH THESE
G5I3Jru9zAw_48 0 THEY'RE A LITTLE DIRTY BECAUSE I JUST RAN THIS WE CAN IT AND YOU'LL NOTICE THESE HAVE A LITTLE BOLD IN THE BACK THAT JUST KEEPS THOSE FROM TURNING AROUND
G5I3Jru9zAw_49 0 IT'S VERY UNCOMFORTABLE THE HORSES LEG WILL BE LIKE THIS SAY THIS WHERE THE TURN AROUND AND THEY BE TRYING TO RUN WITH THAT AGAINST HIM
G5I3Jru9zAw_50 0 IT'S REALLY A COMPASS
G5I3Jru9zAw_51 0 SO MAKE SURE YOU GET A KIND OF HAVE A BOWL THEN IT LIKE THIS TO TRY AND KEEP THEM FROM TURNING IT
G5I3Jru9zAw_52 0 IT WON'T WORK A HUNDRED PERCENT THAT WILL HELP
gxPOvjOIsUM_1 0 HI I'M KELLI ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME TIPS AND TECHNIQUES THAT I USE WHEN CONCEALING DARK CIRCLES UNDER THE EYES
gxPOvjOIsUM_2 0 SOME PEOPLE USE A COUPLE DIFFERENT KINDS OF COLOR CORRECTIVE CONCEALERS WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO COVER MORE SERIOUS DISCOLORATIONS AROUND THE EYE AREA
gxPOvjOIsUM_3 0 SO YOU CAN USE A MOST THE TIME YOU'LL GET A LOT OF SHADOW RIGHT HERE ON THE INNER PART OF THE EYE WHICH WILL USUALLY BE MORE OF A PURPLISH COLOR SO YOU WOULD WANT TO USE A YELLOW CONCEALER THERE TO HELP NEUTRALIZE WITH THAT
gxPOvjOIsUM_4 0 YOU ALSO MAY HAVE A PERSON WHO'S A LITTLE MORE RED OR A LITTLE MORE SWELLING UNDER THE EYES SO THAT USUALLY WILL BE RIGHT UNDER THE LASH LINE THE LOWER LASH LINE SO YOU WOULD WANT TO USE A GREEN BASE THERE
gxPOvjOIsUM_5 0 SOMETIMES YOU'LL SEE PEOPLE WITH VEINS OR BLOOD VESSELS THAT ARE REALLY CLOSE TO THE SURFACE MORE OF A BLUISH TENSION THAT WILL USUALLY BE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN IN THE EYE SOCKET SO YOU MAY WANT TO USE A PINK CONCEALER THERE TO HELP COVER THAT UP A LITTLE BIT
gxPOvjOIsUM_6 0 OR IF YOU'RE HAVE A LOT OF BLUE IN THE CORNER OF THE EYE YOU MAY WANT TO USE A PINK THERE THAT WILL REALLY HELPS TO BRIGHTEN UP THE EYE AS WELL
gxPOvjOIsUM_7 0 SO YOU CAN DEFINITELY INCORPORATE DIFFERENT COLORS OF COLOR CORRECTING CONCEALER INTO YOUR UNDER EYE AREA INTO YOUR COVERING REGIMEN TO GIVE YOU BETTER COVERAGE AND JUST DETERMINE WHAT KIND OF DISCOLORATION YOU HAVEN'T WHICH AREA AND PUT THAT CAN PROPER CONCEALER THERE BEFORE YOU PUT A CONCEALER THAT MATCHES YOUR SKIN TONE ALL OVER THE ENTIRE EYE
gxPOvjOIsUM_8 0 SO THAT'S WHERE YOU WOULD WANT TO APPLY COLOR CORRECTIVE CONCEALER
g9At9nuk4ek_1 0 THIS IS CALLED A GOLDEN SLEEVE
g9At9nuk4ek_2 0 AND HERE WE HAVE THE DASH LINES REPRESENTING THE ACTUAL ARM UNDERNEATH THE FABRIC
g9At9nuk4ek_3 0 AND WHEN WE GET A DRAW IN OUR SLEEVE THERE'S DIFFERENT
g9At9nuk4ek_4 0 DON'T AND CAN BE ANYTHING FROM A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT LOOSE ON YOUR ARM TUNES RULES SLOW YOU LOSE
g9At9nuk4ek_5 0 IT'S A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT GRADES OF THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
g9At9nuk4ek_6 0 DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS AND LOOSE
g9At9nuk4ek_7 0 IS THIS ONE WE HAVE A ALMOST IT TIGHT SLEEVE IN THE BACK
g9At9nuk4ek_8 0 NOTICE THAT THEY DON'T ASLEEP WE THE OR OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE ELBOW EVEN THOUGH IS PERFECT
g9At9nuk4ek_9 0 THAT'S TO SHOW YOU THAT WE'RE ADDING MORE FABRIC TO IT
g9At9nuk4ek_10 0 IT'S A LOSER VERSION OF A FITTED SLEEVE
g9At9nuk4ek_11 0 ALLOWING FOR MORE RANGE OF MOTION AND JUST ENDS GETTING MORE FABRIC OVERALL
g9At9nuk4ek_12 0 AND WE HAVE THAT WRIST LINE AT THE NATURAL WRIST LINE
g9At9nuk4ek_13 0 IF YOU WANT TO GO FURTHER GO FURTHER
g9At9nuk4ek_14 0 BUT TYPICALLY DON'T IT MEANS KIND OF LIKE A PORK CHOP SLEEVE
g9At9nuk4ek_15 0 WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE BLAST THERE AT THE BICEP GOING TO HAVE A FITTED RACE WINE
g9At9nuk4ek_16 0 SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BELT OUT AT THE WRIST LINE BECAUSE THEN IT CEASES YOU CAN AND DON'T LEAVE
g9At9nuk4ek_17 0 SO FOR THE JUST REMOVE IT
g9At9nuk4ek_18 0 EASE WHATEVER IS BLOTCHY AT THE TOP
g9At9nuk4ek_19 0 IT AT THE BOTTOM
gNX56yonyo4_1 0 HELLO

gNX56yonyo4_10 0 AGAIN LOOKING AT OUR SCALE DEGREES WE'VE GOT ONE THAT WAS OUR D FIVE ARE A HAD ANOTHER D DOWN HERE AND NOW WE'VE GOT OUR FLAT THREE THERE
gNX56yonyo4_11 0 IN ORDER TO PLAY IT IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT
gNX56yonyo4_12 0 INSTEAD OF USING OUR FIRST FINGER TO PLAY THAT IS WE DID BEFORE THE MAJOR BRINGING USE OUR SECOND FINGER AND THIS WAY WE CAN GET OUR FIRST FINGER BACK TO EASILY HIT THAT F NATURAL OR JUST THE F ON THE FIRST FRET B
gNX56yonyo4_13 0 THAT'S OUR F THERE
gNX56yonyo4_14 0 PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER WE'VE GOT THE D A AND E AND F NATURAL THERE AT THE END OF

HfMtsNEfXOU_1 0 HI THIS IS JON AND IN THIS CLIP WE'LL BE ATTACHING THE HANDLE
HfMtsNEfXOU_2 0 TO ATTACH THE HANDLE WE WANT TO MAKE IT VERY SECURE SO WHEN YOU LIFT UP IT DOESN'T PULL OUT
HfMtsNEfXOU_3 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO PUT A COUPLE SCREWS IN EACH SIDE THAT ARE GOING TO BE AT AN ANGLE CORN DOWNWARD INTO OUR HANDLE
HfMtsNEfXOU_4 0 ADDITIONALLY WE ARE GOING TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF GLUE ON IT JUST TO GIVE IT THAT ADDED HOLDING POWER
HfMtsNEfXOU_5 0 FIRST I'M JUST GOING TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF GLUE ALONG THE INSIDE EDGES AND I'M GOING TO SLIP MY HANDLE INTO PLACE
HfMtsNEfXOU_6 0 NEXT I'M JUST GOING TO BE DRILLING A PILOT HOLE THROUGH MY SIDE INTO MY HANDLE
HfMtsNEfXOU_7 0 IT HAS HOT AND AFTER THAT I'M JUST GOING TO INSTALL MY SCREW
HfMtsNEfXOU_8 0 AND ANOTHER SCREW ON THE OTHER SIDE SHOULD DO IT
HfMtsNEfXOU_9 0 NOW DEPENDING ON THE LOOK THAT YOU'RE GOING FOR YOU CAN ALSO COUNTERSINK THESE SCREWS AND EVEN PUT A PLUG OR A BUTTON ON WHERE THAT WHOLE WOULD BE
HfMtsNEfXOU_10 0 AND ONCE YOU'VE INSTALLED THE HANDLE YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT A TEST MAKE SURE DOESN'T SHAKE AROUND OR IT'S NOT LOOSE
HbAyUeyxH7A_1 0 SO BELIEVE IT OR NOT CIRCUIT BENDING IS PRETTY EASY
HbAyUeyxH7A_2 0 AND I THINK THE REASON A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T DO IT IS WELL MAYBE LIKE TWO PEOPLE THINK THAT IT'S KIND OF A WEIRD THING TO DO
HbAyUeyxH7A_3 0 SO YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST A QUESTION OF TASTE
HbAyUeyxH7A_4 0 BUT IT'S REALLY EASY AND YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW A LOT ABOUT ELECTRONICS I MEAN EXCEPT FOR JUST MAYBE THE VERY BASICS OF YOU KNOW CONDUCTING ELECTRICITY BETWEEN TWO PARTS ARE MADE OUT OF METAL
HbAyUeyxH7A_5 0 I MEAN THAT'S REALLY KIND OF ALL YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THESE ARE LOW VOLTAGE DEVICES
HbAyUeyxH7A_6 0 THERE'S NO RISK OF ELECTRIC SHOCK
HbAyUeyxH7A_7 0 YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY EASY TO GET IN THERE AND MESS AROUND WITH THE CIRCUIT BOARD
HbAyUeyxH7A_8 0 IF YOU GET THINGS LIKE THIS A THRIFT STORE THAT REALLY INEXPENSIVE SO YOU'RE NOT RISKING YOU KNOW DAMAGING SOMETHING YOU KNOW YOUR REVERSIBLE YOU REPLACE A PLIE
HbAyUeyxH7A_9 0 AND YOU KNOW AS LONG AS YOU CAN LEARN HOW TO USE A SOLDERING IRON SAFELY AND YOU KNOW YOU LEARN HOW TO SOLDER CORRECTLY I THINK ANYONE CAN DO IT
HbAyUeyxH7A_10 0 SO THIS ONE POINT IS IS DON'T BE SCARED OFFER DON'T BE DETERRED FOR MAYBE TRYING TO GET INTO THIS BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ELECTRONICS
HbAyUeyxH7A_11 0 BECAUSE CIRCUIT BENDING IS VERY MUCH OF A KIND OF A EXPLORATORY ACTIVITY WHERE YOU KIND OF MAKE IT UP AS YOU GO ALONG AND IT'S PRETTY EASY TO GET GOOD RESULTS WITHOUT A WHOLE LOT OF WORK WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING A WHOLE LOT ABOUT ELECTRONICS BEFORE YOU BEGIN
GZ7JnCMxujE_1 0 NOW LET'S CONSIDER IN THE B MAJOR VOICING SECOND INVERSION NOTES IN B MAJOR OUR B ROOTS D SHARP THIRD F SHARP THE FIFTH

GRo-h1ydCo4_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE DOT COM MY NAME IS STAN AND I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT COMMUNITY THEATER AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT YOUR PROPS AND COSTUMES AND HOW TO STORE THEM IN YOUR MAKEUP AS WELL
GRo-h1ydCo4_2 0 IT'S THE BIG PROBLEM OF PROPS MAKEUP AND COSTUMES IS KEEPING THEM ORGANIZED KEEPING IN INVENTORY OF THEM AND STORY
GRo-h1ydCo4_3 0 ESPECIALLY THE COSTUMES AND PROPS GET TO BE QUITE A STORAGE PROBLEM
GRo-h1ydCo4_4 0 ONE THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TRY TO BORROW THINGS THAT YOU CAN RETURN OR BY CHEAP THINGS FROM THE THRIFT SHOPS AND THEN YOU DONATE THEM TO THE THRIFT SHOPS SO THAT YOU DON'T BUILD UP A HUGE INVENTORY OF THINGS
GRo-h1ydCo4_5 0 EVERY PLAY HAS SOME COSTUMES THAT ARE IN PROPS THAT ARE PRETTY STANDARD BUT THEY'RE ALSO SOME UNIQUE THINGS THAT YOU PROBABLY WON'T NEED AGAIN FOR YEARS
GRo-h1ydCo4_6 0 WHY TAKE UP SPACE TRYING TO STORE THEM UP
GRo-h1ydCo4_7 0 IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY IN CHARGE OF EACH OF THOSE FUNCTIONS THEY CAN BE IN CHARGE OF KEEPING THESE THINGS ORGANIZED IN TOWARD AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
GRo-h1ydCo4_8 0 SOMETIMES YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF GOING OUT AND BUYING A PROP IN YOUR FIND AT YOUR ALREADY HAD IT IN STORAGE BUT NOBODY REALIZE THAT WAS THERE
GRo-h1ydCo4_9 0 SO HAVING A LIST OF THOSE ARE HAVING A COMPUTER DATABASE IS REALLY HANDY THING IF YOU CAN GET ORGANIZED ENOUGH TO DO THAT
GRo-h1ydCo4_10 0 WE FIND THESE THE PLASTIC YOUR CABINETS TO BE VERY HANDY FOR STORING THINGS
GRo-h1ydCo4_11 0 PARTICULARLY MAKEUP AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT REALLY SHOULDN'T BE LEFT OUT WORKING GET DUSTY AND THAT SORT OF THING OR SO
GRo-h1ydCo4_12 0 THESE ORGANIZING THINGS THAT YOU CAN GET A AT ANY DISCOUNT STORE ARE VERY HANDY WAYS OF STORING THINGS
GRo-h1ydCo4_13 0 COSTUMES TYPICALLY WE HAVE HANGING UP FIND RACKS AND THE COVERED WITH PLASTIC TO KEEP THE DUST OFF OF THEM BUT WE DON'T START MANY COSTUMES HERE
GRo-h1ydCo4_14 0 WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO IT VERDE VALLEY THEATER WAS WORK OUT OF A COOPERATIVE ARRANGING WITH ON THE LOCAL SCHOOLS THAT HAS A DRAMA DEPARTMENT
GRo-h1ydCo4_15 0 THEY STORE ALL OF OUR COSTUMES AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO US WHENEVER WE NEED THEM OR WANT TO USE THEM AND THE SCHOOL ALSO HAS TO USE
GRo-h1ydCo4_16 0 THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE THEY GET MORE USE THAT WAY
GRo-h1ydCo4_17 0 WE DON'T HAVE TO STORE THEM AND THAT'S A BIG BENEFIT DOES
GRo-h1ydCo4_18 0 LIKE MOST EARS WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF STORAGE SPACE
GRo-h1ydCo4_19 0 EVEN WITH THE NEW THEATER BUILDING THAT'S BEING DONATED TO US WE STILL WON'T HAVE ENOUGH STORAGE SPACE TO KEEP A LARGE INVENTORY COSTUMES
GRo-h1ydCo4_20 0 SO IF YOU CAN WORK ON A COOPERATE WITH ANOTHER ORGANIZATION IT HAS STORAGE SPACE THAT'S A REAL BENEFIT
Gmr0ojPiEXo_1 0 ALRIGHT AND THE NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE MACHINE AND EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR THE MACHINE TO BE READY TO PREPARE ESPRESSO
Gmr0ojPiEXo_2 0 ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS IS WHILE YOU TURN YOUR MACHINE ON IT AND LET IT WARM UP AND LET IT GET UP TO THE TEMPERATURE OPERATING TEMPERATURE
Gmr0ojPiEXo_3 0 ONE AND ONE OF THE NEXT THING IS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT NOT EASY STEP TO MISS IS FILLING OUT THE WATER TANK WHICH THEY ON THIS MACHINE IS UNDER THIS UNDER THIS PLATE RIGHT HERE IN THE BACK OF THE MACHINE
Gmr0ojPiEXo_4 0 A LOT OF MACHINES THAT DON'T HAVE AN AUTOMATIC SHUT OFF WHERE IT SHUTS OFF IF THE WATER TANK IS EMPTY IF IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT THAT FEATURES WHICH THIS ONE DOES THEN THEY CAN MESS OF THE ESPRESSO MACHINE A WHOLE LOT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO BREW COFFEE AND THAT IS INTO
Gmr0ojPiEXo_5 0 THE ONE YOU HAVE YOUR ESPRESSO MACHINE ALL WARMED UP
Gmr0ojPiEXo_6 0 YOU CAN MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS FLOWING RIGHT OUT OF THE STEAM WAND BY JUST KIND OF PERSIAN THAT INTO A TOWEL
Gmr0ojPiEXo_7 0 YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO BE CAREFUL AND ROCK THE TOWEL AROUND IT LIKE I JUST DID SO YOU DON'T BURN YOURSELF MAYBE FLOW LITTLE WATER THROUGH THE GROUP THROUGH THE PORTER FILTER PREVENT A
Gmr0ojPiEXo_8 0 THAT'S ALSO GOING TO WARM UP THE PORTER FILTER
Gmr0ojPiEXo_9 0 AND YOU'RE GOING TO GO

GddcwkKELd4_4 0 THIS IS IF YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE BEST CREDIT IN THE WORLD IT'S OKAY DON'T BE AFRAID THINKING THAT YOU CAN BUY A NEW CAR
GddcwkKELd4_5 0 THERE ARE MANY MANY CAR MANUFACTURERS OUT THERE THAT ARE A LOT MORE LENIENT THEN YOU MIGHT THINK
GddcwkKELd4_6 0 FOR EXAMPLE FORWARD MOTOR CREDIT IS ONE OF THE MOST LENIENT FINANCING COMPANIES AVAILABLE TODAY
GddcwkKELd4_7 0 SO EVEN IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE CREDIT SCORE THEY CAN STILL FINANCE YOU A NEW CAR
GddcwkKELd4_8 0 SOMETIMES EASIER THAN OTHER MANUFACTURERS
GddcwkKELd4_9 0 SO DO DO YOUR HOMEWORK WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCING AND WHEN IT COMES TO LEASING A WHEN IT COMES TO JUST THE OVERALL CREDITWORTHINESS OF WHAT YOU THINK YOU CAN BUY BECAUSE YOU MAY BE DRIVING IN THE CAR AS OPPOSED TO NOT DRIVING IN THE CAR IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE RIGHT PRODUCT LINE
GddcwkKELd4_10 0 SO REMEMBER SOME PRODUCT LINES WILL ALLOW YOU TO FINANCE A CAR AND ACTUALLY ACHIEVE ALONE FOR YOU THAN OTHERS
GddcwkKELd4_11 0 JUST GO OUT AND FIND THE ONE THAT THAT SUITS YOUR CREDIT NEEDS AND COMPATIBILITY
gbYt1ZlN5Xw_1 0 ALRIGHT TODAY WE'RE GOING TO FURTHER SAY OUT TOO MUCH IN YOUR LETTUCE
gbYt1ZlN5Xw_2 0 THERE'S A MATURE LETTUCE BED THAT I'VE THINNED OUT

gbYt1ZlN5Xw_11 0 THERE WE GO
H6WIfzbz2SU_1 0 IN THIS SERIES I'LL BE DISCUSSING THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARDS IN MAGIC THE GATHERING
H6WIfzbz2SU_2 0 CARDS ALL FALL UNDER TO CATEGORIES LAND OR SPELLS
H6WIfzbz2SU_3 0 ANYTHING THAT'S NOT A LAND IS IT'S SIMPLY DISPEL EVEN IF IT BECOMES SOMETHING ELSE AFTERWARDS
H6WIfzbz2SU_4 0 THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARDS ARE LAND CREATURE ARTIFACT ENCHANTMENT SORCERY INSTANT TRIBAL AND PLANES WALKER
H6WIfzbz2SU_5 0 CARDS CAN ALSO HAVE SOME TYPES AND SUPER TYPES
H6WIfzbz2SU_6 0 SOME TYPES COME AFTER THE TYPE OF SUPER TYPES COME BEFORE THE TIGHT
H6WIfzbz2SU_7 0 EVERY CARD HAS AT LEAST ONE TYPE AND MANY CARDS HAVE MORE THAN ONE SUCH AS ARTIFACT CREATURES AND TRIBAL CARDS
H6WIfzbz2SU_8 0 THE WAY THAT IT'S ORGANIZED IS THAT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE PICTURE AND THE TEXT BOX IS WHAT'S CALLED THE TYPE LINE
H6WIfzbz2SU_9 0 THIS SAYS BASIC LAND FOREST AND IT'S ONE OF THE SIMPLEST CARDS IN TERMS OF TYPE
H6WIfzbz2SU_10 0 ALSO IN THE TYPE LINE IS THE EXPANSION SET IT INDICATES IT'S WEIRD
gGGPUNrOZsk_1 0 HERE WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE TWO EXAMPLES OF TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTERSECT
gGGPUNrOZsk_2 0 THERE ARE MANY CREATURES AND AGAIN WHICH ARE BOTH ARTIFACTS AND CREATURES
gGGPUNrOZsk_3 0 THIS REPRESENTS THE IDEA OF ROBOTS ANOTHER ONE MACHINES THAT SIEGE ENGINES
gGGPUNrOZsk_4 0 THIS IS THE EXTRUDER AND THIS IS A GOBLIN WORE WAGON
gGGPUNrOZsk_5 0 LET'S SAY ARTIFACT CREATURE IN THEIR TYPE AND THEY BOTH HAVE A POWER AND TOUGHNESS IN THE LOWER RIGHT HAND CORNER
gGGPUNrOZsk_6 0 THAT MEANS THAT THESE CARDS CAN BE AFFECTED EITHER BY THINGS THAT EFFECT AND SHOULD ARTIFACTS DESTROY TARGET ARTIFACT OR ENCHANTMENT SUCH AS THIS THE CHIN
gGGPUNrOZsk_7 0 OR SOMETHING THAT SAYS TARGET CREATURE GETS MINUS THREE MINUS THREE UNTIL END OF TURN
gGGPUNrOZsk_8 0 EITHER A CURSE LIKE FOR DISENCHANT COULD KILL EITHER OF THESE CARDS BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH ARTIFACTS DISENCHANT THEY BOTH HAVE THREE TOUGHNESS PROTECTOR SLICK
gGGPUNrOZsk_9 0 THESE CARDS HAVE ADVANTAGES IN THAT THEY'RE COLORLESS AND CAN BE PLAYED IN ANY DECK FOR THE COST OF FORM AND EACH IN ANY COLOR
gGGPUNrOZsk_10 0 BUT THEY ALSO HAVE DISADVANTAGES OF BEING SUSCEPTIBLE TO A WIDE RANGE OF CARDS
gIp8qya-Zos_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO HAVE YOUR DOG SIT IN WEIGHT
gIp8qya-Zos_2 0 THIS IS A GREAT EXERCISE TO USE AT DOORWAYS TO ENSURE THE DOG IS NOT DARTING OUTSIDE
gIp8qya-Zos_3 0 IT ALSO IS NICE TO KEEPING POLITE WHEN COMPANY COME TO THE DOOR OR ANY TIME THAT YOU JUST NEED TO STEP AWAY AND YOU WANT THE DOG TO REMAIN BEHIND
gIp8qya-Zos_4 0 I'M GOING TO START WITH THE SIT POSITION SIT SPECIALTY WOULD ON COMMAND
gIp8qya-Zos_5 0 AGAIN THIS IS THE PLACEMENT
gIp8qya-Zos_7 0 WHEN I DID THIS HAND COMMAND IS JUST LIKE I'M GOING TO STOP TO THE DOG'S NOSE
gIp8qya-Zos_8 0 THEN I'M GOING TO STEP OFF ON MY RIGHT FOOT RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE DOG STEPPING AWAY AND THEN RETURNING TO THE DOG
gIp8qya-Zos_9 0 THAT'S THE WHOLE COMMAND
gIp8qya-Zos_10 0 ONCE I WALK SHE CAN GET UP
gIp8qya-Zos_11 0 SHE DID GET UP A LITTLE EARLY SOME PLACE OR BACK INTO THE SIT
gIp8qya-Zos_12 0 WAIT STEPPING IN FRONT STEPPING BACK AND THEN SHE CAN GO FORWARD
gIp8qya-Zos_13 0 IT'S A GREAT WAY TO ENSURE THAT YOUR DOG IS NOT TRIPPING YOU AT THE DOOR ARE THAT THEY ARE STAYING SAFE IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY MAY NOT BE COMFORTABLE
gIp8qya-Zos_14 0 SO PRACTICE THAT WHENEVER YOU GO OUT THE DOOR WAY
gT35PHYO7rE_1 0 HI MY NAME'S ADDISON FROM CAPTAIN BILLS I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO RUN THE BASIC VOLLEYBALL DRILLS
gT35PHYO7rE_2 0 THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT DRILLS YOU CAN USE TO PLAY OR PRACTICE VOLLEYBALL
gT35PHYO7rE_3 0 THERE'S SERVING DRILLS PASSING DRILLS HITTING DRILLS AND SETTING DRILLS
gT35PHYO7rE_4 0 FIRST ONE SERVING DRILLS
gT35PHYO7rE_5 0 PROBABLY MOST KEY THING AND SERVING IS REPETITION UNDER IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO YOU CAN GET YOURSELF CONSISTENT
gT35PHYO7rE_6 0 SO IN SERVING BUT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO HAVE A BASKETBALLS TAKE THE BOND FRONT OF YOU TOSS IT UP IN FRONT OF THE HIGH ENOUGH SO YOU HAVE TIME TO GET TO IT AND HIT IT WITH YOUR HAND
gT35PHYO7rE_7 0 YOUR HAND WANTS TO BE OPENED NEEDS TO BE OPEN AND YOU WANT TO HIT IT WITH THE PALM OF YOUR HAND
gT35PHYO7rE_8 0 SO WHEN YOU HIT IT TOSS THE BALL IN FRONT OF YOU TAKE YOUR ARM BACK LEAD WITH YOUR ELBOW AND HIT WITH YOUR HAND OPEN AND OUT IN FRONT OF YOU
gT35PHYO7rE_9 0 PASSING DRILL AS YOU WOULD NEED A TALL STIR AND A PASS OR AN A TARGET
gT35PHYO7rE_10 0 SO THE TOSS OR WHAT TOSS THE BALL TO THE PASSER PASSER WANTS TO GET BEHIND THE BALL FACE THE TARGET USE THEIR KNEES GET THERE BUT DOWN
gT35PHYO7rE_11 0 USE YOUR PLATFORM PUT YOUR ARMS ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER FOLD THEM TOGETHER TO BUILD YOUR PLATFORM
gT35PHYO7rE_12 0 ONE PASSING THE BALL YOU WANT TO HIT IT BETWEEN YOUR WRIST AND YOUR ELBOW
gT35PHYO7rE_13 0 I'M PASSING AND THE TOSS IS GOING TO PASS IT TO THE PAT TOSS IT TO THE PASSER AND THEN THE PASS OR WILL USE THEIR LEGS KEEP THEIR BUT DOWN FACE THAT TARGET TO TRY TO GET INTO THE TARGET
gT35PHYO7rE_14 0 REPETITION IS ALSO VERY EFFECTIVE AND PASSING DRILLS BECAUSE PASSING IS THE BACKBONE OF VOLLEYBALL
gT35PHYO7rE_15 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE VERY VERY CONSISTENT PASSER AND YOU WILL SUCCEED IN VOLLEYBALL
gT35PHYO7rE_16 0 HITTING DRILLS SO YOU WILL HAVE A CENTER WHO WILL SET THE BALL TO THE HAIR
gT35PHYO7rE_17 0 NOW HITTING AND YOU'RE HITTING IT YOU WANT TO TAKE A TWO STEP APPROACH
gT35PHYO7rE_18 0 SO WHEN YOU DEPENDING ON WHAT IF YOU'RE LEFT HANDED ARE RIGHT HANDED YOU'RE GOING TO STEP WITH THE OPPOSITE FOOT
gT35PHYO7rE_19 0 SO I'M RIGHT HANDED SO I'M GOING TO STEP FIRST WITH MY RIGHT FOOT TO TAKE A TWO STEP APPROACH RIGHT LEFT BEND DOWN PUT MY HANDS BEHIND ME PALMS FACING UP AND THEN ONCE ON DOWN AND BRING MY HANDS UP TO BRING ME UP HIGHER ABOVE THE GROUND AND I'M GOING TO DROP MY ELBOW LEAD WITH MY LEFT ARM AND SWING THROUGH THE BALL
gT35PHYO7rE_20 0 SO THE SET IS GOING TO SET YOU THE BALL YOU TAKE YOUR APPROACH JUMP UP AND HIT IT OVER THE NET
gT35PHYO7rE_21 0 THE NEXT DRILL IS SETTING DRILL SETTING DRILLS
gT35PHYO7rE_22 0 SETTING YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU USE ALL FIVE OF YOUR FINGERS YOU WANT YOUR FINGERS TO BE VERY VERY RELAXED
gT35PHYO7rE_23 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE SETTING THE BALL YOU WANT TO TAKE THE BALL AND SHAPE YOUR HANDS IN THE SHAPE OF A BALL
gT35PHYO7rE_24 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE SETTING THE BALL TAKE THE BALL ABOVE YOUR HEAD WHERE AS IF YOU MISS THE BALL I WOULD HIT YOU IN YOUR FOREHEAD
gT35PHYO7rE_25 0 SO TAKE THAT OFF AND SET AND CANNOT STAY IN YOUR HANDS VERY LONG SO YOU WANT TO GET OUT ALMOST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
gT35PHYO7rE_26 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR HANDS TOUCH THE BALL OF THE EXACT SAME TIME
gT35PHYO7rE_27 0 IT'S THAT YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING THE EXACT SAME TIME THAT IS AN ILLEGAL HIT CAUGHT A DOUBLE HEAD
gT35PHYO7rE_28 0 SO IF MY HANDS DON'T HIT THE BALL THE EXACT SAME TIME IT'S AN ILLEGAL HAT
gT35PHYO7rE_29 0 SO A SETTING DRILLS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A TALL CIRCLE TOSS TO THE BALL AND YOU GET UNDER IT USE YOUR LEGS FACE YOUR TARGET AND YOU WANT TO PUSH THE BALL OUT WITH YOUR LIGHT NOT ONLY ARREST BUT YOUR LEGS ALSO AND FACE YOUR TARGET AND TRY TO GET IN THE TARGET
gT35PHYO7rE_30 0 ALL OF THESE DRILLS ARE NEED NEED TO HAVE REPETITION
gT35PHYO7rE_31 0 EACH DRILL YOU NEED TO WORK ON A DAILY TO BE CONSISTENT AND TO SUCCEED IN VOLLEYBALL
gT35PHYO7rE_32 0 AND THAT IS HOW YOU RUN THE BASIC VOLLEYBALL DRILLS

GL0jG3gy4rk_1 0 HI MY NAME IS LAUREN AND TODAY I'M HERE DISCUSSED DISCUSS HOW MUCH MONEY AND AS A PERMANENT HAIR STRAIGHTENING COST
GL0jG3gy4rk_2 0 THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF STRAIGHTENERS THAT YOU CAN DO AT THIS POINT
GL0jG3gy4rk_3 0 YOU HAVE YOUR RELAXER WHICH SIMPLY SOFTENS YOUR NATURAL CURL AND RELAX IS IT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO BLOW YOUR OWN HAIR OUT IN ORDER TO MANAGER CURL
GL0jG3gy4rk_4 0 THE RELAXER CAN BRING FROM A KINKY CURL INTO A BIT OF A SOFTER CURL
GL0jG3gy4rk_5 0 IT CAN ALSO TRY TO HELP YOU ACHIEVE THAT STRAIGHT HOWEVER THE RELAXER WILL MORE OR LESS TO MORE OF A RELAXATION ON YOUR CURL AND NOT NECESSARILY STRAIGHTEN IT
GL0jG3gy4rk_6 0 USUALLY YOUR RELAXERS RUN ABOUT ANYWHERE FROM SIXTY FIVE TO EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS IN ORDER TO PUT THE RELAXER ON
GL0jG3gy4rk_7 0 IN ORDER TO HAVE THE PROCESSING PLUS PRODUCT
GL0jG3gy4rk_8 0 IT DOES NOT TAKE TOO LONG IT PROBABLY BE ABOUT AN HOUR ENTIRE PROCESSING TIME AND CAUSE A LITTLE BIT LESS
GL0jG3gy4rk_9 0 THE MORE EXPENSIVE THUMB OUT THERMAL STRAIGHTENERS WOULD BE MORE OR LESS YOUR JAPANESE STRAIGHTENING OR YOUR IONIC STRAIGHTENERS
GL0jG3gy4rk_10 0 THIS PROCESS FOR THAT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME CONSUMING IN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU GO THROUGH WITH A STRAIGHT IRON AND STRAIGHTEN THE HAIR AFTER YOU PROCESS IT
GL0jG3gy4rk_11 0 AND THEN YOU NEUTRALIZE THE HAIR WITH THAT STRAIGHTENER
GL0jG3gy4rk_12 0 THIS PROCESS CAN TAKE ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO FIVE HOURS
GL0jG3gy4rk_13 0 IT'S GOING TO BE MORE COST COSTLY AND BUT DEFINITELY MORE EFFECTIVE AND GETTING KINKY CURLY HAIR INTO A LOT STRAIGHTER HAIRSTYLE
GL0jG3gy4rk_14 0 SO HERE TAKE YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING ANYWHERE FROM SIX TWO FIVE AND THEN WORK YOUR WAY UP DEPENDING ON YOUR HAIR DENSITY YOUR HAIR LENGTH AND WHERE YOU ACTUALLY GO
GL0jG3gy4rk_15 0 WHAT SPA SALON WHERE YOUR LOCAL STYLIST IS AND HOW MUCH THEY ARE CHARGING
GL0jG3gy4rk_16 0 AND THAT IS HOW MUCH HAIR STRAIGHTENERS COST

grhjcXNayy0_4 0 THINK OUT OF THE BOX AND NOT HEAD YOU'RE JUST YOUR NORMAL LIVING ROOM

ggOK7FgqROs_2 0 SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT GO INTO MAKING A SESSION RUN SMOOTHLY

ggOK7FgqROs_7 0 SO YOU KNOW AS A PRODUCER YOU REALLY NEED TO PICK AND CHOOSE WHO YOU WORK WITH AND A LOT OF TIMES THERE'S NO WAY THAT NO WAY TO REALLY TELL YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL WITH NOT GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO IT'S SORT OF A GAMBLE YOU KNOW ON EACH PROJECT WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET PAID IF IT'S GOING TO BE SUCCESS
ggOK7FgqROs_8 0 THAT'S WHY A LOT OF PRODUCERS JUST WANT TO GET PALE FIND ON YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH THE STUFF ON THE BACK IN
ggOK7FgqROs_9 0 SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT
ggOK7FgqROs_10 0 ANOTHER THING TO DO WITH THAT I'VE EXPERIENCE MYSELF A LOT IS ALL THE LONG HOURS

gh0vsBwlJcQ_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT A FAMILY MEMBER CAN DO TO HELP A PERSON WHO SUFFERING FROM OCD
gh0vsBwlJcQ_2 0 ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO NOW AS A FAMILY MEMBER IS WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP
gh0vsBwlJcQ_3 0 ONE OF THE ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION IS GETTING FORMED
gh0vsBwlJcQ_4 0 LEARN WHAT OCD IS LEARN WAY IT SOME OF THE THINGS AREN'T THAT YOU CAN DO
gh0vsBwlJcQ_5 0 KIND OF INFORM YOURSELF AS TO WHAT KIND OF TREATMENT YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS RECEIVING
gh0vsBwlJcQ_6 0 NOW IF THEY'RE NOT EVEN RECEIVING TREATMENT AND ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO IS HELPS THEM FIGURE OUT IF TREATMENTS NECESSARY AND IF THEY HAVE OCD THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS GETS THE DO NEED TREATMENT
gh0vsBwlJcQ_7 0 IF THEY ARE OPEN ENOUGH TO HAVE YOU GO WITH THEM TO THE DOCTOR IT'S HELPFUL BECAUSE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AT DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THAT PERSON
gh0vsBwlJcQ_8 0 YOU KNOW THEM YOU LOVE THEM YOU MAY BE ABLE TO TELL THEM WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE NOTICED TRIGGER SOME OF THEIR BEHAVIORS
gh0vsBwlJcQ_9 0 YOU MIGHT HAVE A BETTER ESPECIALLY IF YOUR PARENTS YOU MIGHT HAVE A BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR MEDICAL BACKGROUND ANY KIND OF MAJOR EVENTS
gh0vsBwlJcQ_10 0 AGAIN OCD CAN BE CAUSED BY A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENTAL
gh0vsBwlJcQ_11 0 ESPECIALLY IF IT'S ENVIRONMENTAL TRIGGER YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO NOTICE A LOT MORE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND AROUND THEM
gh0vsBwlJcQ_12 0 AGAIN IT'S NOT CAUSED BY A SPECIFIC TRAUMATIC AT BENT LIKE PTSD IS BUT BY OTHER FACTORS
gh0vsBwlJcQ_13 0 AND AS A FAMILY MEMBER YOU MIGHT NEED SOME SUPPORT AS WELL SO

HDsCNrtgSrk_1 0 HI THIS IS JON AND IN THIS CLIP I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT USING SHARP BLADES
HDsCNrtgSrk_2 0 BEFORE YOU PERFORM ANY CUTTING TASK YOU ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BLADE ON YOUR PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IS SHARPER AND IN PROPER WORKING CONDITION
HDsCNrtgSrk_3 0 IF THE BLADE IS GOAL THE WOODWORKERS GOING TO HAVE TO WORK HARDER TO MAKE THE CUT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PUSH THAT BOARD IN JUST A LITTLE BIT HARDER AND THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT THE BLADE WILL BIND THE PIECE OF WOOD WILL KICK BACK OR POTENTIALLY THE BLADE WILL EVEN BREAK LIKE ON THIS THIN BLADE ON THIS SCROLL SAW
HDsCNrtgSrk_4 0 ADDITIONALLY IF YOU HAVE A SHARP BLADE YOU'RE GOING TO PRODUCE A MUCH CLEANER FASTER BETTER LOOKING CUT
HDsCNrtgSrk_5 0 NOW THIS ALSO GOES FOR SAND PAPER YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR SAND PAPER ON YOUR SANDY MACHINE HAS A GOOD STRONG GRIP ON IT
HDsCNrtgSrk_6 0 IF IT'S WORN DOWN TOO MUCH IT'LL JUST POLISHING BUFF AND POTENTIALLY BURN THE PROJECT THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON
HDsCNrtgSrk_7 0 NOW EVEN WITH LAID TIGHT TOOLS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BLADES ON THOSE ARE SHARP AS WELL
HDsCNrtgSrk_8 0 AS YOU'RE WORKING ON THE LATHE IF YOU DO HAVE A DULL BLADE AGAIN IT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU A BAD CUTS BUT ALSO THERE'S MORE OF A CHANCE OF IT GETTING CAUGHT ON THE WOOD AND KICKING THAT BACK AT YOU
HDsCNrtgSrk_9 0 NOW EVEN TOOLS AS SIMPLE AS A CHISEL IF THE BLADE IS DOLL IT WILL CAUSE YOU TO WORK A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO MAKE THAT CUT AND IT MIGHT POTENTIALLY SLIP AND COULD CAUSE YOU INJURY
GoV9Ng9VBIM_1 0 THIS IS JOHN THAN A BROKEN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I AM INVITING YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR SERIES OF INTERMEDIATE STAGES OF ENCAUSTIC PAINTING
GoV9Ng9VBIM_2 0 I HAVE A FAVORITE PHRASE THAT GETS ME GOING ALL KINDS OF DIRECTION
GoV9Ng9VBIM_3 0 IT GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF AND THEN I WANT HER WHERE THAT LITTLE THOUGHT TAKES ME IN THIS CASE IF YOU'VE GOT ME THINKING ABOUT HOW CAN I MULTIPLY THE TOOLS THAT I HAVE TO MAKE MANY MORE TOOLS OUT OF THE ONE TOOL
GoV9Ng9VBIM_4 0 AND WHAT I'VE GOT ME THINKING WAS WHAT IF I TOOK A PIECE OF COPPER FOIL THAT YOU CAN GET A CRAFT STORE
GoV9Ng9VBIM_5 0 COMES IN DIFFERENT THICKNESSES USUALLY IN A ROLE IN A TUBE AND YOU'D ON ROLL IT LAY IT OUT AND I TOOK THE IRON AND I LAID IT DOWN ON TOP OF THE COPPER MY TRACED AROUND IT WITH THE PENCIL AND THIS IS SO THIN THAT YOU CAN CUT IT WITH A PAIR OF SCISSORS
GoV9Ng9VBIM_6 0 SO AFTER I CUT THAT I MADE SURE I LEFT A LITTLE TABS AROUND THE PATTERN SO THAT WHEN I PUT THE IRON ON HERE I COULD THEN JUST SNAP IT RIGHT ON TO THE IRON
GoV9Ng9VBIM_7 0 BUT LET'S CLEVER ABOUT THIS IS THAT THIS COPPER SO SOFT YOU CAN SCORE THE COPPER WITH A TOOL
GoV9Ng9VBIM_8 0 IT'S CALLED IN BOXING
GoV9Ng9VBIM_9 0 SO YOU CAN EMBOSS PATTERNS ON TO THE PLATE AND THEY'LL SHOW UP ON THE OTHER SIDE SO THAT WHEN YOU'RE USING THE IRON WITH THE WAX AND YOU'RE LAYING IT DOWN AND PICKING IT UP YOU'RE GETTING THIS LITTLE PATTERN TRANSFERRED ONTO THE WAX
GoV9Ng9VBIM_10 0 NOW A HANDY LITTLE THING IS IS THAT I THINK I SAID BEFORE THAT THIS LITTLE PIN POINT IF YOU DROP IT YOU'LL KNOW MESS UP THE POINT IT'LL BAND LIKE THIS ONE HAPPENS TO BE BENT
GoV9Ng9VBIM_11 0 INSTEAD OF THROWING IT AWAY I TOOK SOME OF THIS LITTLE PIECES OF COPPER SLIP IT INTO THE LITTLE BENT PIECE OF THE PAN POINT AND MADE A LITTLE FOOT THAT I COULD ALSO USE WITH THE WAX
GoV9Ng9VBIM_12 0 JUST ANOTHER WAY TO MULTIPLY YOUR TOOLS

h5Qwr8w5eQI_1 0 HI MY NAME IS LAUREN AND TODAY I'M HERE TO DISCUSS TO DISCUSS CAN HIGHLIGHT HAIR DURING PREGNANCY
h5Qwr8w5eQI_2 0 CONSIDERING THAT HIGHLIGHTING IS NOT TOUCHING THE ROOT OF YOUR HAIR AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO YOUR BLOODSTREAM SO THE CHEMICALS CAN BE QUITE SAFE THAT WAY THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY GOING AND HITTING YOUR ROOT
h5Qwr8w5eQI_3 0 WHEN YOU GET YOUR HAIR HIGHLIGHTED YOU'RE GOING UP TO AND CLOSE TO THE ROOT HOWEVER YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO BE HITTING THE SKIN SO THEREFORE NONE OF IT WILL BE GOING IN WITH INTO YOUR BLOODSTREAM SO HIGHLIGHTING CAN ALTERNATELY BE VERY SAFE FOR EAR WHILE YOU ARE PREGNANT
h5Qwr8w5eQI_4 0 I DO HOWEVER RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONSULT A DOCTOR AND MAKE SURE THAT IT GOES ALONG WITH YOUR PLANT
h5Qwr8w5eQI_5 0 ALSO THE FIRST THREE MONTHS IN THE FIRST TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY IS THE MOST CRUCIAL TIME OF PREGNANCY SO IF YOU CAN WAIT FOR THOSE THREE MONTHS AND NOT GET IT DONE SO THAT WAY YOU'RE NOT EVEN SURROUNDED BY THE CHEMICALS BY BEING WITHIN THIS ON YOU MAY BE BETTER OFF
h5Qwr8w5eQI_6 0 I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR AND THAT YOU DO HAVE HIS PERMISSION IN ORDER TO GET YOUR HAIR HIGHLIGHTED BUT AS FOR HIGHLIGHTING IT SHOULD BE PERFECTLY SAFE IN ORDER FOR YOU TO GET YOUR HAIR HIGHLIGHT INJURING PREGNANCY

gDrx8HY5pV8_6 0 GOING OVER IT GOING OVER IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN YOU CAN TAKE THOSE TOOLS AND IF YOU'RE LEARNING LIKE THE DRUMS AND SOME RUDIMENT ON THE DRUMS YOU CAN APPLY THOSE WOULD SHEDDING TECHNIQUES TO THAT INSTRUMENT TO
H8_qs3-EDG4_1 0 SO THE NEXT TRICK WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON IS CALLED SUICIDE
H8_qs3-EDG4_2 0 THIS IS A REALLY COOL TRICK FOR OFF STRING
H8_qs3-EDG4_3 0 IF YOU'VE ALREADY LEARNED IT WITH THE REGULAR STRING TRICK SECTION THAT WE TAUGHT IT'S PRETTY DIFFERENT SO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ONE ON
H8_qs3-EDG4_4 0 IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO WEAR
H8_qs3-EDG4_5 0 SO WHAT YOU DO YOUR THROW THE YOYO JUST LIKE NORMAL AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO THROW AND RELEASE THE STRINGS

H8_qs3-EDG4_10 0 THE STRING SHOOTS AROUND IN MID AIR AND YOU REALLY JUST GRAB IT AGAIN
H8_qs3-EDG4_11 0 THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS ONE A LITTLE BIT EASIER THAN THE STRING TRICK VERSION AS IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHERE YOU WRAP AS LONG AS YOU CAN JUST GET A HOLD OF IT
H8_qs3-EDG4_12 0 SO LET ME SHOW YOU ONE MORE TIME WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE
H8_qs3-EDG4_13 0 YOU THROW A NORMAL THROW

h7EHvskA68w_1 0 SO I'M SITTING IN THE MAIN OF THE UTILITY MAN THE DUGOUT
h7EHvskA68w_2 0 THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT UTILITY MAN IS NOT IMPORTANT IT JUST MEANS THAT HE'S NOT ON THE FIELD AT ALL TIMES
h7EHvskA68w_3 0 UTILITY MAN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE HE IS A GENERAL BACK UP TO JUST ABOUT EVERY ONE ON THE FIELD
h7EHvskA68w_4 0 UTILITY MAN WHILE HE MAY NOT SPECIALIZE IN ANY SPECIFIC POSITION HE HAS TO BE GOOD AT A VARIETY OF POSITIONS
h7EHvskA68w_5 0 A GOOD UTILITY MAN LIKE WILSON BOTTOM IT FOR THE NEW YORK YANKEES IS ABLE TO FILL IN AT THIRD BASE HE'S ABLE TO FILL IN A SHORT STOP SECOND BASE SOMETIMES SPELL THE FIRST BASEMAN
h7EHvskA68w_6 0 YOU CAN PLAY A LITTLE BIT IN THE OUTFIELD DOES JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT PITCHING CATCH
h7EHvskA68w_7 0 THOSE ARE SOME VERY SPECIALIZED POSITIONS AND GENTLE UTILITY MAN DO NOT PLAY THEM
h7EHvskA68w_8 0 HOWEVER UTILITY MAN HAS TO BE READY TO COME INTO THE GAME AND ANY TIME ON THE IF THERE'S AN INJURY IF THERE'S A DEFENSIVE REPLACEMENT NECESSARY
h7EHvskA68w_9 0 ANY NUMBER OF SITUATIONS COULD RESULT IN A UTILITY MAN BEING CALLED ON AND ANY TIME IN THE GAME
h7EHvskA68w_10 0 GENERALLY WHAT UTILITY MAN IS USED FOR IS TO BE PUT IN A LATER INNINGS OF THE GAME AFTER A PINCH IT OR IS BEING USED
h7EHvskA68w_11 0 PERHAPS YOUR BEST PEN CHITTER IS ACTUALLY AN OUTFIELDER BUT YOU'RE GOING TO PINCH IT IN FOR YOUR SECOND BASEMAN BECAUSE YOU NEED THE OFFICE TO SCORE RUN LATE IN THE GAME
h7EHvskA68w_12 0 SO THE UTILITY MAN WILL GO IN AND REPLACE THAT PINCH HITTER ON THE FIELD
h7EHvskA68w_13 0 IF YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO LEFT FIELDER PLAYING SECOND BASE
h7EHvskA68w_14 0 UTILITY MAN AGAIN HAS A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY
h7EHvskA68w_15 0 HE'S GOT TO BE ABLE TO PLAY ANY NUMBER OF POSITIONS AT ANY GIVEN TIME
h7EHvskA68w_16 0 IT'S ALWAYS GOT TO BE READY TO GO TO IS VERY VERY ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF A GOOD THING
h7EHvskA68w_17 0 IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR SUCCESSFUL BASEBALL TEENS THE WALL THAT ALL ABOUT ONE COMMON FOR IT

hH6Ve6SuyWI_1 0 HI THIS IS DAVID JACKEL ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT CONVERTING MIDI FILES TO AUDIO FILES IN GARAGE BAND
hH6Ve6SuyWI_2 0 NOW THE REASON YOU WOULD WANT TO TAKE A MIDI FILE AND CONVERTED TO AN AUDIO FILE IS THAT IT'S MUCH LESS OF A DRAIN ON YOUR COMPUTER
hH6Ve6SuyWI_3 0 BECAUSE MANY FILES ARE COMPLETELY SOFTWARE INSTRUMENTS THAT MUCH MORE COMPLEX THE E THAT MEMORY AND THEY SLOW DOWN A SONG
hH6Ve6SuyWI_4 0 WHEN YOU SET ON HOW YOU WANT THE MIDI FILE TO BE CONVERT INTO AN AUDIO FILE TO MAKE IT MUCH LESS OF A TRAINING YOUR COMPUTER
hH6Ve6SuyWI_5 0 SO LET'S SAY I WANT TO ADD JUST ANOTHER LOOP BUT I DON'T WANT IT TO BE AS A MIDI FILE WHAT I DO IS I GO INTO GARAGE BAND SELECT PREFERENCES GO INTO LOOPS UP HERE WHERE IT SAYS ADDING LOOPS TO TIME LINE
hH6Ve6SuyWI_6 0 I SELECT CONVERT TO REAL INSTRUMENT OKAY NOW LET'S TRY IT OUT SO THERE'S THIS LOOP RIGHT HERE THAT I WANT TO USE A OKAY SO I CLICK IT AND DRAG IT OVER HERE AND NOW AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S BLUE NOT GREEN
hH6Ve6SuyWI_7 0 GREEN MEANS MILTIE BLUE MEANS REAL AUDIO OR AND THAT WAY AS I CONTINUE TO ADD LOOPS I CAN DO SO IN A WAY THAT ISN'T GOING TO SLOW DOWN MY COMPUTER AND MAKE IT FREEZE
hH6Ve6SuyWI_8 0 SO ONCE YOU SET ON HOW YOU WANT YOUR MIDI PART TO GO USE THIS TECHNIQUE TO MAKE THINGS EASIER ON YOUR COMPUTER
GNQFRoOBU6o_1 0 TO CALCULATE YOUR BODY MASS INDEX YOU WANT TO FIGURE OUT YOUR WEIGHT AND KILOGRAMS
GNQFRoOBU6o_2 0 YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT AND DIVIDED BY YOUR HEIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT YOUR HEIGHT AND METERS
GNQFRoOBU6o_3 0 THAT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU YOUR BMI
GNQFRoOBU6o_4 0 SO A VERY SAFE RANGE FOR BMI IS ANYTHING BETWEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT
GNQFRoOBU6o_5 0 ANYTHING BELOW NINETEEN IS CONSIDERED UNDERWAY
GNQFRoOBU6o_6 0 ANYTHING ABOUT TWENTY FIVE IS CONSIDERED OVERWEIGHT ALSO GOING INTO THE LATTER AND OF OBESITY
GNQFRoOBU6o_7 0 IF USING THAT EQUATION IS WAY TOO COMPLICATED FOR YOU YOU CAN GO TO VARIOUS WEBSITES ON THE INTERNET YOU'RE GOING TO PRESS AND BMI THEY'RE GOING TO COME UP WITH THE CALCULATOR AND THEY'RE GOING TO HELP YOU GET THROUGH IT
GNQFRoOBU6o_8 0 YOU'RE JUST GOING TO PUNCH IN YOUR HEIGHT AND YOUR WHITE AND THEY'LL FIGURE IT OUT FOR YOU AUTOMATICALLY
GNQFRoOBU6o_9 0 SO BASICALLY YOUR BODY MASS INDEX IS FIGURED UP FROM YOUR HEIGHT IN YOUR WEIGHT AND HOW MUCH OF THAT IS BODY FAT

Hi_JTPFkX9c_3 0 AT THAT TIME WE DISCUSSED THE SPECIFICS OF EXACTLY WHAT WAS DECIDED IT'S SURGERY BECAUSE SOMETIMES THERE'S SOME CHANGES THE LAST MINUTE IN TERMS OF THE SIZE
Hi_JTPFkX9c_4 0 BUT THEY'RE REALLY SHOULD NOT BE ANY SURPRISES FOR THE PATIENT
Hi_JTPFkX9c_5 0 BUT AT THAT TIME YOU WE LET THE PATIENT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT SIZE THEY HAVE AND GIVE THEM A INFORMATION CARDS THAT THEY CAN HAVE THAT FOR THEIR RECORDS FOR THE FUTURE SO THAT IF THERE'S ANY PROBLEM THEY CAN ALWAYS REFER BACK TO WHAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR BREASTS
Hi_JTPFkX9c_6 0 AND THEN THE PATIENT IS INSTRUCTED TO START SHOWERING IN BEING IS ACTIVE AS POSSIBLE
Hi_JTPFkX9c_7 0 AND THEN GENERALLY WE START THE PATIENT ON AN OF MASSAGE ROUTINE WITH THE IMPLANTS ARE MOVED IN MOBILIZED A BIT TO HELP THEM TO ACCOMMODATE TO THE SPACE THAT'S BEEN CREATED BENEATH THE MUSCLE
Hi_JTPFkX9c_8 0 AT THAT POINT THE PATIENT IS GENERALLY OFF PAIN MEDICINE AND COMPLETING A SHORT COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS AND STARTING TO GET BACK TO THE NORMAL ROUTINE
Hi_JTPFkX9c_9 0 THEY HAVE A POST SURGICAL BROUGHT WHICH IS A SOFT SPORTS TYPE RAW AND WE HAVE THE PATIENT WHERE THAT PRETTY MUCH FULL TIME FOR THE FIRST WEEK OR SO AND THEN GRADUALLY TO WEAN OFF OF THAT AND THEN INTO A NORMAL BRA SHORTLY THEREAFTER
GV-8NsvgUuE_1 0 ARE YOU A MASSAGE THERAPIST AND YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO CHOOSE YOUR MASSAGE TABLE
GV-8NsvgUuE_2 0 WHAT ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU THINK ABOUT
GV-8NsvgUuE_3 0 WELL I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THREE GOOD TIPS TODAY
GV-8NsvgUuE_4 0 I'M SUNDAE WITH NATURAL SUNDAE
GV-8NsvgUuE_5 0 NOW LIKE I JUST THAT THERE ARE SO MANY CHOICES IN SO MANY OPTIONS THESE DAYS FOR BY YOUR MASSAGE TABLE BUT THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT ONES ARE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR TABLE IS THE RIGHT SIZE AND TWENTY INCHES IN WITH TO THIRTY TWO INCHES ARE THE RECOMMENDED WITH FOR MASSAGE TABLE
GV-8NsvgUuE_6 0 IF IT'S TOO NARROW YOUR CLIENT AND A FALL OFF AND THAT'S NOT GOOD
GV-8NsvgUuE_7 0 AND IF IT'S TOO WIDE YOU THERAPIST IS GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME WORKING AROUND IN AND UP PROBABLY INJURING HER BACK SO TWENTY TO THIRTY TWO INCH IS USUALLY THE RECOMMENDED WHAT FOR MASSAGE TABLE
GV-8NsvgUuE_8 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A RIGHT BOLSTER WHICH IS THE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT SUPPORT YOUR LOWER BACK
GV-8NsvgUuE_9 0 NOW BOLSTERS COME IN MANY SHAPES AND MANY SIZES AND MANY KINDS OF PADDING
GV-8NsvgUuE_10 0 YOU WANT TO REALLY TEST YOUR BOLSTER OUT MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T JUST COME WITH A A LITTLE A BOLSTER THAT IS JUST FREE WITH THE TABLE
GV-8NsvgUuE_11 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THE QUALITY BOLSTER NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT THE MANUFACTURER THROWING IN WITH YOUR TABLE
GV-8NsvgUuE_12 0 MAKE SURE IT'S NICE MAKE SURE YOU LIKE YOUR BOLSTER BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO GET A LOT OF USE OUT OF IT AND IT'S IMPORTANT
GV-8NsvgUuE_13 0 AND THE THIRD PIECE OF EQUIPMENT TO REMEMBER ON YOUR TABLE IS YOUR LOCKING MECHANISM ON YOUR FACE CRADLE
GV-8NsvgUuE_14 0 FIRST THING YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR CRADLE IS GOING TO SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF YOUR HEAD
GV-8NsvgUuE_15 0 YOU WANT TO A REALLY STABLE LOCKING MECHANISM
GV-8NsvgUuE_16 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO BE VERY PADDED
GV-8NsvgUuE_17 0 SO GET FAMILIAR WITH THESE THINGS BEFORE YOU PUT YOUR MONEY ON THE TABLE AND BUY IT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TAKE THEM BACK
GV-8NsvgUuE_18 0 SO LOCKING MECHANISM VERY VERY IMPORTANT
GV-8NsvgUuE_19 0 IF YOU'RE LOCKING MECHANISM GOES OUT THAT'S BAD NEWS
GV-8NsvgUuE_20 0 YOU CAN HURT YOUR CLIENTS NECK AND THAT'S NEVER GOOD
GV-8NsvgUuE_21 0 SOMETHING CAN RESULT FROM THAT THAT YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK ABOUT SO A GOOD STURDY NECK REST
GV-8NsvgUuE_22 0 I'M AND THEN ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT THAT I DIDN'T EVEN WASN'T REALLY AWARE ABOUT UNTIL I BOUGHT MY TABLE THE OWNER OF THE SHOP SUGGESTED THAT I GET A CARRYING CASE WHICH I NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE
GV-8NsvgUuE_23 0 I DID EVEN THOUGH THEY CAME WITH THEM
GV-8NsvgUuE_24 0 BUT CARING CASE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS BECAUSE THAT CASES GOING TO KEEP YOUR ABILITY TO MAKE A LIVING
GV-8NsvgUuE_25 0 IT'S GOING TO INCREASE IT FOR YOU
GV-8NsvgUuE_26 0 IT'S GOING TO KEEP YOUR TABLE NICE AND PROTECTED AND CLEAN
GV-8NsvgUuE_27 0 IF YOUR TABLES EYE PROTECTION CLEAN NOBODY'S GOING TO WANT TO GET ON IT AND IT'S GOING TO GET TORN UP YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER ONE
GV-8NsvgUuE_28 0 AND THEY'RE PRETTY EXPENSIVE SO IT'S A GREAT WAY TO KEEP YOUR TABLE PROTECTED AND KEEP YOUR YOUR MEANS OF MAKING A LIVING PROTECTED
GV-8NsvgUuE_29 0 SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW THINGS TO THINK ABOUT WHEN BUYING YOUR MASSAGE TABLE
GV-8NsvgUuE_30 0 THE WIDTH IS IMPORTANT THE BOLSTER IS VERY IMPORTANT THE LOCKING MECHANISM ON YOUR NECK SUPPORTS VERY IMPORTANT AND YOU DEFINITELY NEED A CASE
GV-8NsvgUuE_31 0 IT'LL BE SO MUCH EASIER TO CARRY AROUND AS WELL

h6JQJCzdpRs_1 0 THE NEXT THING WE DISCUSS IS THE HEATING FOR YOUR SAMPLE
h6JQJCzdpRs_2 0 SAND BOAS ARE REPTILES
h6JQJCzdpRs_3 0 ALL REPTILES DO NEED HEAT TO SOME DEGREE OR ANOTHER
h6JQJCzdpRs_4 0 AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAT ARE SAND BOAS IS WITH A HEAT PAD AND SOME HEAT LAMPS
h6JQJCzdpRs_5 0 NOW THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DO IS WELL LIKE RADIAN HEAT PANELS OR A HEAT TAPE HEAT CHORD THINGS LIKE THAT
h6JQJCzdpRs_6 0 BUT NOT AS READILY AVAILABLE ON THE IN THE PET INDUSTRY AND STILL BE HARDER FOR YOU TO GET YOUR HANDS
h6JQJCzdpRs_7 0 I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HEAT LAMPS
h6JQJCzdpRs_8 0 NOW IN ORDER TO DO THIS WITH YOUR KNEES YOUR NEED ONE HEAT LAMP
h6JQJCzdpRs_10 0 AND THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S GOT A CERAMIC TOP ON IT
h6JQJCzdpRs_12 0 YOU NEED TO BE CERAMIC NOT PLASTIC
h6JQJCzdpRs_13 0 PLASTIC WILL MELT AND CAUSE A FIRE HAZARD
h6JQJCzdpRs_14 0 ALSO YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LAMP IS RATED FOR THE AMOUNT OF WAS YOU'RE GOING TO USE
h6JQJCzdpRs_15 0 AS YOU CAN SEE THIS ONE IS GREAT FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY WATTS WHAT SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE CARE OF US IN A FIFTEEN GALLON TANK
h6JQJCzdpRs_16 0 WE'LL BE TEMPERATURES IN A SECOND AND HOW ARE WHAT TEMPERATURE TRYING TO GET TOO BUT WHATEVER DO WHAT SHOULD TAKE CARE OF YOUR FOR THE MOST PART
h6JQJCzdpRs_17 0 NOW THIS LAMP IS GOING TO GO ON ONE SIDE OF YOUR AQUARIUM JUST LIKE YOU SEE THERE
h6JQJCzdpRs_19 0 FOR THAT LIP TO WORK YOU NEED A HEAT BALL
h6JQJCzdpRs_20 0 NOW I RECOMMEND THE RED HE BULBS BECAUSE YOU'RE LEAVE THIS ON TWENTY FOUR SEVEN
h6JQJCzdpRs_21 0 YOU NEVER GOING TO TURN THIS OFF

h6JQJCzdpRs_23 0 YOU WILL GET READY HE OUT OF THAT BOTH IT'S GOING TO CREATE A HOT SPOT FOR YOU OKAY IN YOUR SIDE YOUR AQUARIUM
h6JQJCzdpRs_24 0 SO THIS IS GOING TO GO INSIDE YOUR LAMP ALRIGHT AND TO CREATE A HOT SPOT RIGHT BELOW IT
h6JQJCzdpRs_25 0 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF YOUR AQUARIUM GOING USE THE HEAT PAD
h6JQJCzdpRs_26 0 NOW HEAT PAD IS GOING TO BE ADHESIVE SELF-ADHESIVE TO A STRIP OKAY JUST LIKE THIS
h6JQJCzdpRs_27 0 YOU PULL OFF THE PLASTIC BACKING
h6JQJCzdpRs_28 0 THIS GOES UNDERNEATH THE AQUARIUM ON THE OUTSIDE
h6JQJCzdpRs_29 0 IT DOES NOT GO INSIDE THE AQUARIUM
h6JQJCzdpRs_30 0 IT ALSO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK COMES WITH THESE LITTLE RUBBER FEET'S

gsit1xgHHWE_10 0 SO GRAB YOUR POOL CUE
gsit1xgHHWE_11 0 LET'S PLAY SOME COOL
glxFg9g3sAI_1 0 ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS YOU WANT TO DO ONCE YOUR CHILD STARTS LEARNING THE ALPHABET AND THE LETTER SOUNDS IS MAKE A WORD NOTEBOOK AND THIS IS GOING TO BE THE CRUCIAL CENTER OF THEIR EDUCATION FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS POSSIBLY
glxFg9g3sAI_2 0 NOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO ALL OF THEIR HOME SCHOOLING IN ONE NOTEBOOK OR ONE FOR READING IN WRITING AND ONE FOR MATH
glxFg9g3sAI_3 0 IN THE OLDEN DAYS THAT'S ALL STUDENTS REALLY HAD WAS ONE NOTEBOOK AND A PENCIL AND A BLACK BOARD AND THEY LEARNED THE OFTEN MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY THEN CHILDREN LEARN TODAY BUT IF YOU WANT TO WORK WITH THE FOLDERS AND WORK SHEETS THAT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IS ADVANCED AS COMPLEX IS YOU WANT TO MAKE IT OR A SIMPLE IS YOU WANT TO MAKE IT
glxFg9g3sAI_4 0 THEY WILL LEARN BECAUSE IT IS ONE ON ONE AND YOU ARE THE TEACHER
glxFg9g3sAI_5 0 BUT A WORD NOTEBOOK IS A GREAT PLACE TO START AFTER THEY LEARN THE ALPHABET LETTER SOUNDS
glxFg9g3sAI_6 0 WHAT WE DO BASICALLY IS EACH PAGE HAS A DIFFERENT TYPE OF WORD
glxFg9g3sAI_7 0 NOW IN THE BEGINNING WE'RE ONLY GOING TO DO A SIMPLE SOUNDING OUT WORDS CONSONANT VOWEL CONSONANT WITH VERY NATURAL SHORT VOWEL SLIGHT CAT AND CAN AND PIN AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO WE'LL START OUT AND FILL THE PAGES WITH THESE
glxFg9g3sAI_8 0 WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS I LIKE TO SWITCH UP THE DIFFERENT VOWELS DON'T ALWAYS DO LETTERS WITH A IN THE MIDDLE FOR TOO LONG AND FOR PAGES AND PAGES IN THE BEGINNING WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE DOING THE SIMPLE WORDS BUT THEN WHEN WE GET IN EACH TIME WE LEARN A NEW RULE WE'LL PUT THE RULE AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE AND THEN FILL THAT PAGE WITH WORDS THAT FOLLOW THAT RULE AND THAT'S HOW WE WILL KEEP OUR WORD NOTEBOOK
GSTkDCgtqdQ_1 0 OKAY NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT TO DO IF YOU SEE DON'T COME OUT OR EQUALLY AS COMMON IF TOO MANY SEED COME OUT
GSTkDCgtqdQ_2 0 COMMON PROBLEM PEOPLE GET OVER ENTHUSIASTIC BAIT PLANT TOO MANY SEED
GSTkDCgtqdQ_3 0 AND ALSO ANOTHER COMMON PROBLEM PEOPLE GET EITHER OVER ANXIOUS OR NERVOUS AND THEY THINK THEY'RE SEED IS DEAD AND HAS AND COME UP IS NOT GOING TO GERMINATE
GSTkDCgtqdQ_4 0 WELL OFTENTIMES ESPECIALLY IN THE COOL KNIGHTS OF EARLY SPRING IF YOUR CDS OUT HERE THAT GERMINATION WILL BE SLIGHTLY RETARDED SO YOU NEED TO GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE TIME
GSTkDCgtqdQ_5 0 IF IN DOUBT YOU CAN APPLY SOME HEAT TO THE BOTTOMS OF THE POTS BUT IN GENERAL THESE COLD HARDY CROPS WILL GERMINATE JUST FINE IN MARCH EVEN IN NEW ENGLAND
GSTkDCgtqdQ_6 0 SO LET'S TALK ABOUT TOO MANY
GSTkDCgtqdQ_7 0 HERE WE SEE A POT OF A ROGAL
GSTkDCgtqdQ_8 0 A LITTLE FROST DAMAGE BUT THEY'RE STILL PLENTY OF LETTING THE ROGAL IN THERE
GSTkDCgtqdQ_9 0 I'M AN X A ROGAL HATER NOW CONVERTED
GSTkDCgtqdQ_10 0 THE WAY TO LEARN TO LIKE A ROW GOAL IS TO EAT IT IN THE WINTER
GSTkDCgtqdQ_11 0 IT'S MUCH TASTIER SWEET DELICIOUS AND NOT SO PEPPERY
GSTkDCgtqdQ_12 0 SO HERE WE HAVE MAYBE A HUNDRED MORE PLANTS
GSTkDCgtqdQ_13 0 WE DON'T WANT TO WASTE THEM THERE'S NOT ENOUGH SPACE IN THERE FOR THEM ALL TO DEVELOP SO HE CAN SEE THIS IS PRACTICALLY ROOT BOUND
GSTkDCgtqdQ_14 0 WE CAN EASILY SUBDIVIDE THE CLUMPS CAN TAKE THIS AND TURN IT INTO A ONE CLUB
HbkcT1XzmAk_1 0 MY NAME IS ANTHONY <UNK> AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO START THE SMALL BUSINESS IN PHOTOGRAPHY
HbkcT1XzmAk_2 0 WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A SMALL BUSINESS OF PHOTOGRAPHY YOU PROBABLY THINK ABOUT WELL I CAN BECOME AN EVENT PHOTOGRAPHER OR I CAN TAKE IMAGES OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BECOME MODELS SO I CAN TAKE IMAGES OF PEOPLE AND THEIR PANTS
HbkcT1XzmAk_3 0 SO THERE'S ALL TYPES OF WAYS THAT YOU COULD START A SMALL BUSINESS IN PHOTOGRAPHY
HbkcT1XzmAk_4 0 ONE THING THAT YOU ALSO WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS ILLEGAL RAMIFICATIONS OF STARTING SMALL BUSINESS
HbkcT1XzmAk_5 0 DO YOU WANT TO GO DOWN AND GET YOU KNOW BASICALLY A SMALL BUSINESS LICENSE FOR YOUR TAX PURPOSES
HbkcT1XzmAk_6 0 YOU REALLY WANT TO AT FIRST THINK ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT BECAUSE IF YOUR SMALL THIS THIS TAKES OFF AND YOU'RE NOT YOU KNOW REALLY A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS YOU MIGHT RUN INTO SOME LEGAL PROBLEMS DOWN THE ROAD
HbkcT1XzmAk_7 0 AND THAT'S ONE AN INSTANCE YOU MIGHT SORT OF THINK ABOUT HOW TO START THE SMALL BUSINESS
HbkcT1XzmAk_8 0 THE OTHER IS RESEARCH
HbkcT1XzmAk_9 0 DO SOME RESEARCH INTO OTHER SMALL BUSINESS IS IN YOUR AREA
HbkcT1XzmAk_10 0 NOW THEY CAN BE PHOTOGRAPHY BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE
HbkcT1XzmAk_11 0 THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT YOU KNOW WAYS THAT SMALL BUSINESSES WORK IN FOR ME ONE THING THAT I LIKE TO LOOK AT OUR SMALL RESTAURANTS MOM AND POP SHOPS
HbkcT1XzmAk_12 0 HOW DID THEY START UP
HbkcT1XzmAk_13 0 HOW MUCH MONEY DID THEY NEED
HbkcT1XzmAk_14 0 WHAT KIND OF INSURANCE THAT THEY NEED
HbkcT1XzmAk_15 0 WHAT KIND OF STAFF THAT THEY HAVE
HbkcT1XzmAk_16 0 HOW DEDICATED AND HOW ORGANIZED WHERE THEY WHEN THEY STARTED
HbkcT1XzmAk_17 0 IN THIS REALLY YOU KNOW THERE'S A PRETTY BIG DIFFERENCE AND STARTING LET'S SAY A DINER AND STARTING PHOTOGRAPHY BUSINESS BUT WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT IT IS REALLY NOT THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE
HbkcT1XzmAk_18 0 IT'S A LOT OF ADVERTISING A LOT OF WORD OF MOUTH A LOT OF REALLY PROFESSIONALISM AND JUST YOU KNOW WHAT GOES ON WITH YOUR INTERACTION WITH YOUR CLIENTS
HbkcT1XzmAk_19 0 IN SO IT'S ALSO INCREDIBLY HEART
HbkcT1XzmAk_20 0 MOST RESTAURANTS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EXACT PERCENTAGES BUT THE FAIL
HbkcT1XzmAk_21 0 THEY DON'T REALLY TOUGH BUSINESS AND SO IS PHOTOGRAPHY
HbkcT1XzmAk_22 0 IT LOOKS FUN AND HOW MANY GET PAID FOR DOING SOMETHING THAT I LOVE TO DO FOR FUN
HbkcT1XzmAk_23 0 AND WHEN YOU REALLY GET INTO THE BUSINESS ASPECT OF IT IT'S NOT REALLY FUN
HbkcT1XzmAk_24 0 IT'S A LOT OF WORK WHICH FOR SOME PEOPLE IS FUN
HbkcT1XzmAk_25 0 FOR ME AND WORK IS FUN
HbkcT1XzmAk_26 0 BUT IT'S REALLY THE BASIC FOUNDATIONS OF HOW TO START ANY SMALL BUSINESS
HbkcT1XzmAk_27 0 THEY'RE GREAT BOOKS AT LIBRARIES AND HAVE IT REALLY I THINK THERE'S EVEN HOW TO START A SMALL BUSINESS BUCK
HbkcT1XzmAk_28 0 NOW FIRST AT THAT THESE ARE FAIRLY FAIRLY USELESS TO ME BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THEM THEY WERE REALLY IMPORTANT
HbkcT1XzmAk_29 0 AND AGAIN IT WAS RESEARCH AND TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE THAT STARTED SMALL BUSINESSES
HbkcT1XzmAk_30 0 NOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO REALLY WANT TO TALK TO THE PHOTOGRAPHER THAT YOU MIGHT BE COMPETING WITH BECAUSE HE'S NOT OR SHE'S NOT REALLY GOING TO TELL YOU CAN DO IT
HbkcT1XzmAk_31 0 THAT WOULD BE GREAT
HbkcT1XzmAk_32 0 YOU KNOW COMPETITIONS PRETTY GOOD SOMETIMES FOR CERTAIN THICK PHOTOGRAPHY AND I THINK COMPETITION PHOTOGRAPHY IS AN AWESOME THING
HbkcT1XzmAk_33 0 BUT ANYWAY YOU WANT TO LOOK AT OTHER SMALL BUSINESS IS IN YOUR AREA AND HOW THEY STARTED
HbkcT1XzmAk_34 0 AND THAT'S HOW I WOULD START SMALL BUSINESS PHOTOGRAPHY
hiqk6x1HnHU_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO TALK A FEW TIMES A FEW MORE TIMES ABOUT THE WILLARD FAMILY AND MENTION VARIOUS NAMES AND WHAT THEY DID
hiqk6x1HnHU_2 0 EARLY ON HOWEVER THEY WERE OUT THERE IN THE COUNTRY
hiqk6x1HnHU_3 0 THEY WEREN'T MAKING THAT TOO MANY CLOCKS FOR RICH PEOPLE IN THE CITIES
hiqk6x1HnHU_4 0 SO A BIG TO THE BIG INCENTIVE FOR THEM WITH TO TRY TO MAKE CLOCKS THAT WERE INEXPENSIVE
hiqk6x1HnHU_5 0 THAT THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THAT RICH TO OWN
hiqk6x1HnHU_6 0 THEY WERE IN AND THEN THE FAMILY
hiqk6x1HnHU_7 0 IT CAN THAT OUT THERE IN THE COUNTRY NOT THE NOT UNDER THE PRESSURE'S OF CITY LIFE AND THEY COULD THINK ABOUT HOW THEY COULD DO AN INEXPENSIVE CLOCK
hiqk6x1HnHU_8 0 THIS IS CALLED THE GRAFTON TIME PIZZA BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY WERE WORKING OUT THERE AT THEIR HOMESTEAD WHO'S PICTURE YOU SAW
hiqk6x1HnHU_9 0 GRAFTON TIME TIME PIECE EASTER RARE AN EXPENSIVE
hiqk6x1HnHU_10 0 AGAIN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND THESE AT A FLEA MARKET
hiqk6x1HnHU_11 0 AND IF ONE COMES UP FOR SALE IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE A MANY MANY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
hiqk6x1HnHU_12 0 BUT YOU SHOULD AT LEAST KNOW WHAT IT IS TO KNOW TO APPRECIATE IT WHEN YOU SEE ONE SOMEWHERE
hiqk6x1HnHU_13 0 THE ONE THING YOU MAY NOTICE IS THE FORM
hiqk6x1HnHU_14 0 IF YOU LOOK FROM HERE ON UP YOU BASICALLY HAVE A BRACKET CLOCK
hiqk6x1HnHU_15 0 SO THE THEY WERE WORKING FROM THAT MODEL OF A BRACKET CLOCK
hiqk6x1HnHU_16 0 BUT THE MAIN SPRINGS WHERE EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT TO MANUFACTURE
hiqk6x1HnHU_17 0 SO THEY WERE STILL DEALING WITH WEIGHT DRIVEN CLOCKS THE WEIGHT HANGING UNDERNEATH THE CLOCK WHICH POWERS IT
hiqk6x1HnHU_18 0 SO THEY NEED TO DO SOMETHING UNDERNEATH BOTH THE AS A DECORATIVE FEATURE INTO AND CLOSE THE WEIGHT INSIDE SO WAS AN OUT SWINGING IN THE AIR

grp-q-hxxeQ_8 0 THE MAIN ONE WHEN I PULL THE SINGLE PART IS THEY'LL BE ALONG ARE IN THE CENTER OF IT AND THEY'LL BE A WASHER AND THIS IS REALLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO LOOK FOR
HIRQLSfYWEg_1 0 YOU SEE ONE OF THE MOST BASIC IGNITION PORTMAN POINTS IN MAKING A TALL IS TO COMMUNICATE
HIRQLSfYWEg_2 0 AND IF YOU BE QUIET IT YOUR TAUGHT IF YOU CLAP UP WITH YOUR VOICE IF YOU'RE REALLY REALLY TO SHOT SO THAT YOU CAN'T SPEAK TO HOW OLD EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE LEANING OVER AND WONDERING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
HIRQLSfYWEg_3 0 AND IT'S JUST AS BAD AS THAT CONSTRUCTION GUY HAMMERING ON HIS HAMMER AND INTERFERING WITH EVERY WORD THAT YOU HAVE TO SAY
HIRQLSfYWEg_4 0 SO ONCE AGAIN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR AUDIENCE IS INTERESTED IN WHAT WERE SAYING SO WE WANT TO SPEAK OUT LOUDER
HIRQLSfYWEg_5 0 IS THAT BETTER
HIRQLSfYWEg_8 0 NOW WE HAVE GREAT GLOW
_Gy2B1z9lJk_1 0 WE JUST TALKED ABOUT PADDLING ON EDGE IN A CIRCLE BUT WHEN YOU GO DOWN THE RIVER YOU DON'T YOU DON'T ALWAYS GO IN ONE DIRECTION
_Gy2B1z9lJk_2 0 SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SWITCH DIRECTIONS THE OTHER WAY SO YOU CAN CIRCLE IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
_Gy2B1z9lJk_3 0 IT'S CALLED SWITCHING EDGES IT'S REALLY OLD ALL ABOUT TIMING AND LOOKING WHERE YOU WANT TO GO
_Gy2B1z9lJk_4 0 SO I'M GOING TO PADDLE AWAY FROM YOU AND I'M GOING TO DO A FIGURE EIGHT

_Gy2B1z9lJk_6 0 SO TAKE A LOOK BACK UP A LITTLE BIT FOR FOR YOU
_Gy2B1z9lJk_7 0 I'M GOING TO COME ON BACK TO YOU AND IT WILL TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS
_Gy2B1z9lJk_8 0 SO THE KEY TO SWITCHING EDGES IS DOING SOME SORT OF CORRECTIVE STROKE TO ACTUALLY TURN THE BOAT
_Gy2B1z9lJk_9 0 IN THIS CASE I'M DOING A FORWARD SWEET
_Gy2B1z9lJk_10 0 AND THEN LOOK WHERE I WANT TO GO AND SWITCH MY EDGES
_Gy2B1z9lJk_11 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU DO THAT CORRECTIVE STROKES FIRST BEFORE YOU SWITCH EDGES
_Gy2B1z9lJk_12 0 IF YOU DON'T IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT FOR YOU YOU'LL STILL CARBON THAT SAME EDGE
_Gy2B1z9lJk_13 0 SO LET ME SHOW YOU STEP BY STEP WHAT I'M DOING AND I'LL EXPLAIN TO YOU
_Gy2B1z9lJk_14 0 HERE WE GO
_Gy2B1z9lJk_15 0 SO WHAT I DO IS START WITH THE FORWARD SWEEP IT I LOOK AND SWITCH AND THEN THE KEY THING IS PADDLE FORWARD SO YOU KEEP THAT MOMENTUM INTO THE TURN
_Gy2B1z9lJk_16 0 SO PRACTICE AND FIGURE EIGHTS ON THE PONDS GET GOOD AT IT OR YOU CAN HAVE YOUR FRIENDS DO HUMAN SLALOM IN PRACTICE IN AND OUT OF THEM
_Gy2B1z9lJk_17 0 PERFECT PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT

g50VFgOEKos_1 0 YOU KNOW I TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SWIMMING POOL
g50VFgOEKos_2 0 I ABSOLUTELY HATE THE MANAGER THAT SWIMMING POOL
g50VFgOEKos_3 0 AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY BECAUSE IN MY MIND THIS MAN BELONGS TO THE ABSOLUTE DIRT OF THE EARTH
g50VFgOEKos_4 0 HE'S A SNAIL
g50VFgOEKos_5 0 HE'S A WORM
g50VFgOEKos_6 0 AND ONCE MORE WE SHOULD BE SPENDING ONE MORE TIME ON ANYTHING ON THAT SWIMMING POOL UNTIL WE PROTECT OUR CHILDREN
g50VFgOEKos_7 0 NOW THAT'S MY PERSONAL OPINION
g50VFgOEKos_8 0 IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THAT I THINK YOU BETTER TAKE A SECOND CONSIDERATION ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT'S REALLY SERIOUS
g50VFgOEKos_9 0 IT'S VERY VERY SERIOUS
g50VFgOEKos_10 0 HOW DOES THAT COME ACROSS IN THE TOP
g50VFgOEKos_11 0 AND I'LL MAYBE PRETTY STRONG BUT MAYBE TOO STRONG
g50VFgOEKos_12 0 WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE IT'S NEVER GOOD TO BE SO CONVINCING THAT WE COME ACROSS WITH STRONG POWERFUL THE MOTIONS OF ANGER AND DISCUSSED ESPECIALLY
g50VFgOEKos_13 0 OF COURSE YOU CAN BE POWERFUL YOU COULD BE CONVINCING ABOUT SOMETHING
g50VFgOEKos_14 0 YOU CAN HAVE VERY VERY STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT SOMETHING BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ANGRY
g50VFgOEKos_15 0 VERY VERY IMPORTANT A GOOD TALK ALWAYS CONVEYS A CERTAIN SENSE OF REASON BEHIND IT
g50VFgOEKos_16 0 REMEMBER WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IS COMMUNICATING
g50VFgOEKos_17 0 WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE TO YOU
g50VFgOEKos_18 0 WELL I DON'T WHAT HAPPENS TO ME
g50VFgOEKos_19 0 THE VERY FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS TO ME IS I REACT TO THE NEGATIVE FASHION
g50VFgOEKos_20 0 WHAT WAS THAT YOU WERE SAYING
g50VFgOEKos_21 0 DON'T TALK TO ME THAT WAY
g50VFgOEKos_22 0 THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE FEELING INSIDE
g50VFgOEKos_23 0 YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO THE MESSAGE
g50VFgOEKos_24 0 YOUR REACTING TO THE MOTION
g50VFgOEKos_25 0 VERY VERY IMPORTANT
GUPTKqn6eWs_1 0 HI I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO A CHEST PRESS AS YOU'RE DOING A BRIDGE
GUPTKqn6eWs_2 0 WHEN I TAKE THE BODY ROLL IT OUT UNTIL YOU GET INTO A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR ANKLES YOUR KNEES IN YOUR HIPS ARE IN A STRAIGHT LINE
GUPTKqn6eWs_3 0 YOU'RE GOING TO BRING YOUR FREE WEIGHTS UP
GUPTKqn6eWs_4 0 THE FREE WEIGHTS STARTING WAY IS FIVE TO EIGHT POUND YOU CAN GO UP HEAVIER IF YOU NEED TO
GUPTKqn6eWs_5 0 YOU ARE GOING TO PULL THE ELBOWS OPEN AND AS YOU PRESS UP YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT NOT WALKING YOUR ELBOWS KEEP THE JOINTS SLIGHTLY BENT
GUPTKqn6eWs_6 0 AS YOU COME DOWN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ELBOWS DO NOT COMPLETELY OPEN SO WE WANT TO KEEP ON ALMOST IN LINE WITH THE SHOULDERS KEEP THE BRIDGE UP
GUPTKqn6eWs_7 0 I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR BOTTOM DOESN'T DROP PUTTING PRESSURE YOUR LOWER BACK
GUPTKqn6eWs_8 0 KEEP THE GLUTES ENGAGE THE HIPS IN LINE WITH THE KNEES AND WE'RE JUST SLOWLY PRESSING UP AND DOWN
GUPTKqn6eWs_9 0 FORM IS REALLY IMPORTANT ON THIS ONE SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR HEAD AND YOUR SHOULDERS ARE ON THE BALL
GUPTKqn6eWs_10 0 WE DON'T WANT TO BE UP HERE WHERE YOUR LOWER BACK IS ON THE BALL AS YOU'RE PUSHING UP BECAUSE IT'S GOT A LOT OF STRAIN IN YOUR NECK SO AS YOU'RE SETTING UP KEEP YOUR FREE WEIGHTS DOWN BY YOUR SIDES AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME FROM A SEATED POSITION TO ROLL YOURSELF ALL THE WAY DOWN UNTIL YOU FEEL YOUR HEAD AND YOUR SHOULDERS TOUCH THE BALL
GUPTKqn6eWs_11 0 WE'RE GOING TO REPEAT BETWEEN EIGHT AND FIFTEEN REPS YOU'RE EXHALING AS YOU PUSH UP AND INHALE AS YOU LOWER DOWN SO THINGS TO REALLY THINK ABOUT KEEP YOUR WRIST STRAIGHT TRY NOT TO LET THEM CLOCK TRY NOT TO LET YOUR ELBOWS DROP BELOW THE SHOULDERS KEEP IN LINE WITH THE SHOULDERS AS YOU PUSH UP
GUPTKqn6eWs_12 0 YOUR BACK NEEDS TO BE REALLY STABLE KEEP THE ABS LOCKED IN EXHALE AND INHALE
GUPTKqn6eWs_13 0 SO A COUPLE KEY POINTERS REMEMBER YOU'VE GOT YOUR NINETY DEGREE ANGLE IS WITH YOUR LOWER BODIES YOUR SHOULDERS AND YOUR HEAD TO STAY ON THE BALL
GUPTKqn6eWs_14 0 KEEP THAT NINETY DEGREE ANGLE WITH YOUR SHOULDERS ELBOWS ARE WRIST
GUPTKqn6eWs_15 0 YOU CAN ALSO OPEN THIS UP UNTIL FLY AND DO YOUR FLY WORK WORKING ALL THOSE MUSCLES ACROSS YOUR CHEST KEEP THOSE ABS ENGAGED AND YOU'LL BE READY GO
GUPTKqn6eWs_16 0 SO THAT IS HOW YOU DO YOUR CHEST PRESS IN A BRIDGE POSITION
gxWY84AE9Qw_1 0 HI I'M MARK SULLIVAN FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
gxWY84AE9Qw_2 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO INSTALL A CEILING FAN IN YOUR HOME
gxWY84AE9Qw_3 0 ALSO WHERE THE LIGHT MOUNTING KIT MAT AMOUNTS ON TO THE BOTTOM HOUSING THERE IT IS A NUT AND A WASHER THEY NEED TO PUT ON THERE AND TIGHTEN THAT UP
gxWY84AE9Qw_4 0 THAT'S JUST TO SECURE YOUR LIGHT HOUSING KIT
gxWY84AE9Qw_5 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TIGHTEN THAT UP WITH SOME SOME PLIERS

gxWY84AE9Qw_11 0 AND THE WHITE TO THE PORE AGE
gxWY84AE9Qw_12 0 SO LIKE THAT'S FINE
gxWY84AE9Qw_13 0 AND WE'VE GOT THAT PUT TOGETHER WE WILL GENTLY TUCK THESE WIRES OUT OF THE WAY AND PUSH THE WIRES DOWN INTO THE HOUSING GENTLY
gxWY84AE9Qw_14 0 DON'T DISCONNECT ANYTHING
gxWY84AE9Qw_15 0 AND THEN WHEN IT ALL LOOKS GOOD STEADY IT AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY WIRES TOUCHING ANYTHING
gxWY84AE9Qw_16 0 IF YOU THINK ANYTHING IS GOING TO RUB OFF OR A AND THAT'LL LOOKS PRETTY GOOD RIGHT THERE
gxWY84AE9Qw_17 0 SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO HOOK UP THIS CONNECTOR
gxWY84AE9Qw_18 0 AND WE WILL PUT THE TWO SCREWS IN THREE SCREWS AND THEN WE WILL HAVE OUR LIGHT KIT ATTACHED TO THE HOUSING AND HOOKED ON TO THE CEILING FAN
hdrDeZAi-7U_1 0 ANOTHER OPENING THAT YOU CAN USE THEM IS ONE THAT CLASSICALLY YOU FIND THE ON THE LEATHER MOTORCYCLE JACKET
hdrDeZAi-7U_2 0 IT'S CALLED THE BIKER CAN OBVIOUSLY HAVE
hdrDeZAi-7U_3 0 THIS ONE I HAVE DRAWN IS DOUBLE BREASTED WITH SNAPS
hdrDeZAi-7U_4 0 WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THERE'S SNAPS UNDER THE SCENES OVER I'M PUTTING THEM GREEN
hdrDeZAi-7U_5 0 THE COLLAR SNAPS DOWN IT'S HELD DOWN BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE GOING RIGHT OTHERS THAT WAS GOING TO BE WHEN YOU GET HER COLOR FLOPPY
hdrDeZAi-7U_6 0 I GUESS THAT'S WHERE THAT COMES IN THAT NOW IS MORE OF A DESIGN STYLE AS OPPOSED TO A UTILITY FEATURE
hdrDeZAi-7U_7 0 ONE THAT BIKE APART AND THE REST OF BIKER PART OF IT IN ORDER TO HAVE IT BE LABELED THIS THERE'S A ZIPPER
hdrDeZAi-7U_8 0 THAT LIKE YOU HAVE A TRACK OF PLASTIC TRENCH COAT THAT FOLD OVER IN HOLD ITSELF TOGETHER ON SITE NOT LISTENER
hdrDeZAi-7U_9 0 WITH A BIKE OR JACKET YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE ZIPPER THAT DOES THE SAME THING AS THE BUTTONS DO ON YOUR TRENCH COAT AND IT'S GOING TO READ
GvhVzLUlZGY_1 0 SO ONCE YOU'VE GOT ALL THE SIDES CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER YOU WANT TO TAKE THE BOTTOM PIECE
GvhVzLUlZGY_2 0 NOW THIS IS THE BOTTOM SIDE OF MY BOTTOM PIECE
GvhVzLUlZGY_3 0 IT'S STILL GOT THE CANVAS TEXTURE FROM WHEN I ROLLED IT
GvhVzLUlZGY_4 0 AND I WENT AHEAD AND PUT MY STAMP THAT I USE OR YOU CAN CARVE IN YOUR SIGNATURE
GvhVzLUlZGY_5 0 THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO DO THAT
GvhVzLUlZGY_6 0 BECAUSE LATER ON IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT
GvhVzLUlZGY_7 0 SO FLIP IT RIGHT SIDE UP TO THE SMOOTH SIDE AND THEN GET AN AREA MOIST THAT'S GOING TO BE IN FAR ENOUGH TO BE A SMALL IS THIS THEM SQUARE IS HERE
GvhVzLUlZGY_8 0 WHICH IN THIS CASE EACH SIDE IS ABOUT EIGHT INCHES
GvhVzLUlZGY_9 0 SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I AND SCORING FAR ENOUGH IN THAT THE WALLS ARE GOING TO MEETS THAT SCORED AREA
GvhVzLUlZGY_10 0 AGAIN USE A NICE GOOD AMOUNT OF SLIP
GvhVzLUlZGY_11 0 AND YOU CAN JUST DO THE SLIP ON THE BOTTOM HERE
GvhVzLUlZGY_12 0 YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO DO IT ON THESE BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE PRESSING RIGHT INTO THAT
GvhVzLUlZGY_13 0 SO SCORE THAT UP ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE SLIP ON THERE
GvhVzLUlZGY_14 0 AND THEN ALSO MOISTEN THE BOTTOMS OF ALL OF YOUR WALLS AND GET THEM OUT REALLY WELL SCORED AND MOISTENED
GvhVzLUlZGY_15 0 AND ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT YOU CAN PUT THEM TOGETHER AND I'LL SHOW YOU THAT NEXT
HeBySQSIl5k_1 0 IN THIS SERIES WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO JUGGLE THREE BALLS
HeBySQSIl5k_2 0 WE STARTED WITH JUST A SINGLE BALL
HeBySQSIl5k_3 0 LEARNING THE TIMING AND THE HEIGHT PAST YOU NEED TO MAKE
HeBySQSIl5k_4 0 TO THROW A THREE BALL PATTERN
HeBySQSIl5k_5 0 SO IN THIS THE THROWS GO FROM YOUR FROM YOUR HAND TO THE CORNER OF THE BOX
HeBySQSIl5k_6 0 IMMEDIATELY OVER YOUR OTHER HAND
HeBySQSIl5k_7 0 YOU CATCH ON THE OUTSIDE BRING IT BACK TO THE BOX AND AGAIN
HeBySQSIl5k_8 0 THEN WE ADD THE SECOND BALL AND TRY THE SAME THING
HeBySQSIl5k_9 0 THIS THE PATTERN IS THROW THROW CATCH CATCH
HeBySQSIl5k_10 0 YOU WANT TO TRY AND KEEP IT RIGHT ON WITH
HeBySQSIl5k_11 0 THROW THROW CATCH CATCH
HeBySQSIl5k_12 0 PRACTICE DOING THIS BOTH WAYS AND CLEANING THIS UP A LOT
HeBySQSIl5k_13 0 WE ADD THE THIRD BALL AND THE PATTERN HERE WILL JUST BE SOLID THROWS
HeBySQSIl5k_14 0 IT SHOULD BE THROW THROW THROW THROW
HeBySQSIl5k_15 0 THEY SHOULD TRY AND REALLY BE CLOSE TO THE SAME RHYTHM
HeBySQSIl5k_16 0 SO THAT YOU MAY THROWS ON BEAT EVERY TIME
HeBySQSIl5k_17 0 THROW THROW THROW THROW AND THIS IS OUR THREE BALL CASCADE PATTERN
HeBySQSIl5k_18 0 SO THE FIRST TRICKS YOU WENT OVER
HeBySQSIl5k_19 0 IT'S OVER THE TOP
HeBySQSIl5k_20 0 LIKE THIS TAKING ONE THROW FROM THE OUTSIDE AND THROWING IT OVER
HeBySQSIl5k_21 0 DOING THAT WITH BOTH HANDS
HeBySQSIl5k_22 0 GOING INTO WHAT'S CALLED JUGGLER'S TENNIS
HeBySQSIl5k_23 0 LIKE THIS WHERE ONE BALL IS CONTINUOUSLY CROSSING OVER THE TOP OF THE OTHERS
HeBySQSIl5k_24 0 WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE REVERSE CASCADE
HeBySQSIl5k_25 0 FOR EVERY BALL IS CROSSING OVER THE BALL IN FRONT OF IT
HeBySQSIl5k_26 0 WE ALSO WET OVER MILL'S MESS
HeBySQSIl5k_27 0 WHICH IS WHAT THE MOST FAMOUS JUGGLING TRICKS AND ONE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE TRY TO LEARN EARLY
HeBySQSIl5k_28 0 WHICH LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
HeBySQSIl5k_29 0 NEXT WE'LL BE MOVING ON TO SOME MORE ADVANCED BALL TRICKS
GyadXiKJfLU_1 0 OKAY NOW THIS METHOD OF DOING A KNOB WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO FIRST IS TAKE OUR SCORING TOOL GET IT WET AND SCORE UP THE CENTER WHERE YOU'RE NOT IS GOING TO GO
GyadXiKJfLU_2 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S NICE AND GOOPY BECAUSE THIS LID HAS ALREADY REACH THE LEATHER HARD STAGE
GyadXiKJfLU_3 0 BUT WE'RE GOING TO THROW A FRESH CLAY KNOB ONTO IT
GyadXiKJfLU_4 0 I JUST PINCH A SMALL AMOUNT OF CLAY OFF OF MY CLAY AND ROLL IT INTO A BALL AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE TO MAKE THE KNOB
GyadXiKJfLU_5 0 SO THAT'S WHY WE LEFT A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA THICKNESS HERE ON THIS LID
GyadXiKJfLU_6 0 BECAUSE WE'RE THROWING DIRECTLY DOWN ONTO IT
GyadXiKJfLU_7 0 YOU'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING SOME PRESSURE ON THERE
GyadXiKJfLU_8 0 YOU DO HAVE TO SCORE IT UP AND GET A PRETTY WET
GyadXiKJfLU_9 0 AND IF IT'S TOO THIN YOU'RE JUST GOING TO PUSH STRAIGHT THROUGH THERE AND THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT
GyadXiKJfLU_10 0 SO YOU ALSO WANT TO SCORE YOUR CLAY BALL REALLY WELL
GyadXiKJfLU_11 0 THIS CONNECTION NEEDS TO BE VERY SECURE
GyadXiKJfLU_12 0 IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME TO DRY
GyadXiKJfLU_13 0 TO GET TO THE SAME DRYNESS
GyadXiKJfLU_14 0 YOU JUST WANT TO PUSH THAT DIRECTLY ON THERE AND SQUEEZE IT
GyadXiKJfLU_15 0 NOW BEFORE YOU ADD ANY WATER YOU JUST WANT TO PUSH DOWN AND SQUEEZE TOWARDS THE CENTER OF THIS KNOB SO THAT IT'S ON THEIR OWN
GyadXiKJfLU_16 0 AND ONCE YOU'VE GOT THAT CLAY SECURELY IN PLACE YOU'RE READY TO DO THE ACTUAL THROWING OF THE KNOT WHICH IS WHAT WE'LL DO NEXT

GEkftZ-wKHE_1 0 HI I'M LES WHITLEY
GEkftZ-wKHE_2 0 TODAY I'D LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SQUAT
GEkftZ-wKHE_3 0 THE SQUATS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST OVERALL EFFECTIVE EXERCISES IN TRAINING ALONE TO IMPROVE MUSCULATURE THE LOWER BODY
GEkftZ-wKHE_4 0 WE'VE DONE CORRECTLY MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF YOUR KNEES AS WELL AS THE LOWER BACK
GEkftZ-wKHE_5 0 THE SQUASH IT ALWAYS BE INITIATED BY HAVING A GOOD STANCE GOOD RANGE OF MOTION GOOD FLEXIBILITY WHILE BEING UNDER CONTROL
GEkftZ-wKHE_6 0 A BODY WEIGHT SQUAT AGAIN FEELS AT OUR SLIGHTLY WIDER THAN SHOULDER WIDTH
GEkftZ-wKHE_7 0 MOVING THE HIPS BACK FIRST TO INITIATE THE MOVE IT
GEkftZ-wKHE_8 0 KEEPING THE CHEST AND BODY IN A GOOD UPRIGHT POSITION
GEkftZ-wKHE_9 0 ARMS FOR BALANCE CAN BE OUT IN FRONT CROSSED OVER OR AT HIP LEVEL
GEkftZ-wKHE_10 0 LOWERING THE BODY AGAIN DOWN TO A FULL RANGE OF MOTION AS COMFORTABLE
GEkftZ-wKHE_11 0 GRADUALLY LOWERING YOURSELF AS FLEXIBILITY IMPROVE
GEkftZ-wKHE_12 0 AS YOU MOVE TO THE SQUAT RACK STARTING OFF WITH A GOOD EVEN HAND POSITION ON THE BAR
GEkftZ-wKHE_13 0 ADDRESSING THE BAR THE KNEES
GEkftZ-wKHE_14 0 THE BAR AND GOOD PROPER POSITION ACROSS THE UPPER BACK AND LOWER PART OF THE SHOULDER
GEkftZ-wKHE_15 0 LIFTING THE BAR UP UNDER GOOD CONTROL STEPPING OUT A GOOD FOOT STANCE MAKING SURE THE KNEES TRAVEL IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE TOES
GEkftZ-wKHE_16 0 HIPS MOVE BACK AWAY FROM MID LINE TO INITIATE THE MOTION
GEkftZ-wKHE_17 0 THE BETTING AT THE KNEES LOWERING YOURSELF DOWN UNDER GOOD CONTROL
GEkftZ-wKHE_19 0 WHILE LOWERING IN THE BOTTOM PHASE MAINTAINING A GOOD FLAT BACK IF NOT SLIGHT ARCHING THE SMALLER THE BACK FOR PROTECTION
GEkftZ-wKHE_20 0 WHAT YOU DON'T WANT IS A ROUNDED POSITION FOR THE SPINE TO GET OUT OF SO THAT YOU RUN THE RISK OF INJURING THE LOWER BACK
GEkftZ-wKHE_21 0 THE KNEES AS I'VE MENTIONED SHOULD FOLLOW THE SAME DIRECTION OF THE TOES
GEkftZ-wKHE_22 0 KNEES SHOULD NOT BUCKLE WITH THE TOES ARE POINTED OUT
GEkftZ-wKHE_23 0 YOUR TOES ARE STRAIGHT AHEAD SAME THING NICE SHOULD NOT DEVIATE FROM THE SAME LINE AS THE TOES DIRECTION
GEkftZ-wKHE_24 0 USE THESE EXERCISES TO DEVELOP GOOD POWERFUL STRONG LOWER BODY
GEkftZ-wKHE_25 0 IT DO ITS SAFELY BEFALLEN THOSE TECHNIQUES
GgI-2wEMSE8_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO USE AT LEAST I LIKE TO USE A VARIETY OF PAPERS BUT TO START OUT ONE OF THE EASIEST KINDS OF THE BEST WAYS TO WORK IS ON A PAPER THAT HAS A GRID ALREADY
GgI-2wEMSE8_3 0 BECAUSE WE FIT LIKE THE LETTERS IN BETWEEN THE GUIDELINES THE GRID ALREADY ESTABLISHES PARALLEL LINES SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THE MARKS WITHOUT HAVING TO MEASURE
GgI-2wEMSE8_4 0 NOW FOR ME THAT'S A BIG GLOSS AND I HOPE THAT WILL BE A BIG PLUS FOR YOU
GgI-2wEMSE8_5 0 I THINK GRID PAPER ENABLES YOU TO SET UP YOUR SHEET FOR RIDING IN A WAY THAT'S VERY QUICK AND EFFICIENT AND FOR THAT REASON I THINK YOUR PRACTICE MORE
GgI-2wEMSE8_6 0 SO I RECOMMEND THAT PLAYING THE GRID PAPER ALTHOUGH YOU CAN USE PLAIN PAPER IT
GgI-2wEMSE8_7 0 PLAIN PAPER NECESSITATES MEASUREMENT SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE HITTING YOUR LETTERS INTO A GRID WHICH WILL DISCUSS SHORTLY YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MARK BOTH SIDES OF THE PAGE AND THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT BECAUSE THESE ABOUT LINE UP
GgI-2wEMSE8_8 0 BUT JUST TO GIVE IT GIVE YOU THE IDEA AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO CONNECT THE DOTS WHICH ARE DOING AND THAT SORT OF HAPHAZARD FASHION AND ESTABLISH THE GRID
ghh5IYcGAlY_1 0 MY NAME IS ABBY JONES AND I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PROCESS OF MOVING INTO A NEW APARTMENT

ghh5IYcGAlY_6 0 SO I HAVE CHOSEN TO PUT MY MY DISH TOWELS IN THESE BASKETS MY LINENS
ghh5IYcGAlY_7 0 AND THIS BASKET I'M PUTTING NAPKINS EXTRA NAPKINS AND AND DOES TOWELS
ghh5IYcGAlY_8 0 SO THESE BASKETS KEEP THEM CONTAINS THE KEEP THEM CLEAN BECAUSE I CAN TAKE THESE LINERS OUT AND WASH THEM TOO
ghh5IYcGAlY_9 0 AND THERE I EASILY ACCESSIBLE
ghh5IYcGAlY_10 0 SO THAT THE OTHER THING THAT I'M DOING WITH MY NAPKINS AS I HAVE THIS KIND OF WOOD IN TROUGH
ghh5IYcGAlY_11 0 AND THESE ARE THE NAPKINS THAT I USE THE MOST OFTEN THAT I LIKE USING MORE THAN THE THE EXTRA ONES THAT I HAVEN'T IN THE BASKET

hbXO3sxEvFQ_3 0 YOU HAVE THE STEAM WAND OVER HERE
hbXO3sxEvFQ_4 0 THE FIRST THING YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS PLUG IT IN AND TURN IT ON
hbXO3sxEvFQ_5 0 AND AFTER YOU TURN IT ON YOUR GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL ALL THE PARTS OF THE ESPRESSO MACHINE AND THE WATER IN THE WATER TANK IS HEATED UP TO THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE
hbXO3sxEvFQ_6 0 AND YOU CAN HEAT UP LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE PORTER FILTER A LITTLE BIT FASTER BY FLOW AND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER THE PORTER FILTER OR AND THAT WILL GET IT UP TO THE SAME TEMPERATURE IS THE GROUP HEAD
hbXO3sxEvFQ_7 0 YOU CAN ALSO A FLUSH WATER TO THE STEAM WAND EACH THAT WRAP A TOWEL AROUND IT SO YOU DON'T BURN YOURSELF ON THAT SEAM IT COMES OUT OF A
hbXO3sxEvFQ_8 0 THE WATER TEMPERATURE IS ANOTHER SUPER IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT GOES INTO BREWING ESPRESSO
hbXO3sxEvFQ_9 0 THE TEMPERATURE THAT YOU IT'S PREFERABLE TO KEEP YOUR WATER THAT IS TO THE RIGHT AT TWO HUNDRED DEGREES
hbXO3sxEvFQ_10 0 THE WAY THAT I'LL TEST THAT RIGHT NOW IS BY TURNING ON THE GROUP HEAD AND LETTING WATER FLOW THROUGH HERE AND I TAKE MY THERMOMETER
hbXO3sxEvFQ_11 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO THERMOMETER THE GOES UP TO TWO HUNDRED AT LEAST LIKE TWO AND TWENTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT OR SO
hbXO3sxEvFQ_12 0 AFTER I TURN IT ON THE WATER WILL START COMING OUT NOW STICK IT IN THIS HOLE RIGHT HERE AND WHATEVER TEMPERATURES STARTS TO STABILIZE THAT IS WHERE THE WATER IN THE MACHINE IS GOING TO BE AND I WANT THAT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DEGREES UP
hbXO3sxEvFQ_13 0 ALRIGHT SO THIS MISTING THIS MACHINE DOES HEAT UP THE WATER TO WRITE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DEGREES IN ITS AND IT'S A STABILIZING RIGHT THERE SO THAT IS GOOD AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE THE IT WHERE I WANT IT
hbXO3sxEvFQ_14 0 FOR YOUR INDIVIDUAL A HOME MACHINE YOU HAVE TO REFER TO YOUR HOOK THE YOUR OWNER'S MANUAL TO SEE HOW TO ADJUST THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER IN THE MACHINE OR ALSO TO JUST TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THAT TEMPERATURE STAYING STABLE

GLSEPbGzL5U_2 0 MY NAME IS SHERYL WITH EXPERT VILLAGE <UNK> AND TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MOUNTING A POSTER BOARD A PHOTO OF ANY SIZE
GLSEPbGzL5U_3 0 AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE FIRST DOING THIS IS A GOOD IDEA TO JUST USE A SMALL PHOTO
GLSEPbGzL5U_4 0 THE ONE I'M USING IS ABOUT A FIVE BY A SEVEN INCH PHOTO
GLSEPbGzL5U_5 0 AND YOU COULD EVEN PRACTICE WITH A LITTLE FOR BY SIX INCH JUST TO GET THE HANG OF THIS
GLSEPbGzL5U_6 0 WE HAD TWO PIECES OF BROWN PAPER
GLSEPbGzL5U_7 0 ONE IS ICE SPRAYED OUTSIDE AS SPRAYED GLUE ON THE BACKSIDE OF THIS POSE JOB PIECE OF PAPER
GLSEPbGzL5U_8 0 IT NOW HAS GLUE ON IT
GLSEPbGzL5U_9 0 THAT PIECE OF PAPER THE ONE THAT IS OUTSIDE NEEDS TO BE THROWN AWAY
GLSEPbGzL5U_10 0 ONE I HAVE JUST ROLL THIS ONE
GLSEPbGzL5U_11 0 IT HAS NO GLUE ON IT AND I HAVE JUST ROLL THAT OUT
GLSEPbGzL5U_12 0 YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE THIS PIECE OF PAPER AGAIN
GLSEPbGzL5U_13 0 IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY GLUE ON IT
GLSEPbGzL5U_14 0 THE OTHER THING ABOUT THIS IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MATCHING THIS UP PERFECTLY
GLSEPbGzL5U_15 0 YOU JUST NEED TO GET IT ON THE POST ON THAT FOAM CORE AND DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO MATCH UP BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT GO AHEAD AND CUT IT LATER ON
GC3uGpmvBS0_1 0 HI THIS IS YOLANDA VANVEEN FROM VANVEEN BULBS
GC3uGpmvBS0_2 0 AND NEXT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO GROW CACTUS
GC3uGpmvBS0_3 0 CACTUS OR CACTI IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE PLANT GROW NATURALLY IN THE DESERT
GC3uGpmvBS0_4 0 THEY ARE FOUND ALL OVER THE PLANET BUT USUALLY IN AREAS WITH VERY LITTLE RAINFALL
GC3uGpmvBS0_5 0 WHAT YOU LIVE IN THE NORTHWEST LIKE I DO
GC3uGpmvBS0_6 0 WE CAN STILL GROW THEM WITHOUT LIVING IN THE DESERT
GC3uGpmvBS0_7 0 THEY DO REALLY WELL IN OUR CLIMATE AS WELL
GC3uGpmvBS0_8 0 SO THE TRICK WITH CACTI IS TO MAKE SURE TO ONLY PUT THEM OUTSIDE OVER THE SUMMER
GC3uGpmvBS0_9 0 IF YOU LIVE IN A COLD CLIMATES
GC3uGpmvBS0_10 0 AND MAKE SURE AND WRONG INSIDE AND THEN WINNER
GC3uGpmvBS0_11 0 IF YOU GET BELOW MAYBE FIFTY DEGREES AT NIGHT
GC3uGpmvBS0_12 0 BECAUSE THEY REALLY DON'T WANT TO FREEZE
GC3uGpmvBS0_13 0 IF YOU A THEY FREEZE YOU WILL LOSE THEM
GC3uGpmvBS0_14 0 SO THEY'RE VERY EASY TO GROW
GC3uGpmvBS0_15 0 I JUST PUT THEM OUT ON MY DECK
GC3uGpmvBS0_16 0 AND THEY LOVE THE HOT SUN AND THEY LIKE TO DRY OUT IN BETWEEN
GC3uGpmvBS0_17 0 AND SO WHENEVER THE NIGHTS GET BELOW FIFTY I BRING THEM BACK INSIDE
GC3uGpmvBS0_18 0 AND THEY SEEM TO DO REALLY WELL THAT WAY
GC3uGpmvBS0_19 0 SO THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU CAN GROW ON
GC3uGpmvBS0_20 0 THE KEY WITH CACTUS IS NOT WATER I'M TOO MUCH
GC3uGpmvBS0_21 0 AND THIS IS JUST ONE IN A LITTLE BOWL
GC3uGpmvBS0_22 0 AND IT SEEMS TO REALLY LIKE IT
GC3uGpmvBS0_23 0 IT GETS LOSS OF MOISTURE THAT STAYS IN THERE
GC3uGpmvBS0_24 0 AND IT LOOKS NEAT THERE TOO
GC3uGpmvBS0_25 0 SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT CREATIVE WAYS THAT YOU CAN GROW ON
GC3uGpmvBS0_26 0 AND I WATER THIS MAYBE ONCE A MONTH
GC3uGpmvBS0_27 0 VERY VERY LITTLE DRY WATER IT
GC3uGpmvBS0_28 0 THIS SMALL CACTUS I REALLY LIKE
GC3uGpmvBS0_29 0 IT'S A KIND OF EUPHORIA WHICH IS THAT'S CONSIDERED THE TRUE CACTUS
GC3uGpmvBS0_30 0 BUT IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL AND JUST KEEP GROWING AND GROWING
GC3uGpmvBS0_31 0 AND I STARTED WITH A LITTLE ONE LIKE THIS ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO
GC3uGpmvBS0_32 0 AND THE LITTLE ONE NOW HAS TO BE TRANSPLANTED
GC3uGpmvBS0_33 0 BECAUSE IT'S GOT MASK
GC3uGpmvBS0_34 0 I JUST LOVE
GC3uGpmvBS0_35 0 IT'S JUST GROWN INGROWN INGROWN
GC3uGpmvBS0_36 0 NOW AS YOU CAN SEE I'M USING GLOVES WHEN I PLAY WITH THEM
GC3uGpmvBS0_37 0 BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY SHARP
GC3uGpmvBS0_38 0 AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW HARD IT IS TO GET THE LITTLE CACTUS LITTLE PRICKS BACK OUT OF YOUR SKIN
GC3uGpmvBS0_39 0 BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HARD
GC3uGpmvBS0_40 0 AND THEY COME IN ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES
GC3uGpmvBS0_41 0 IN THIS PARTICULAR CACTUS I LIKE TO
GC3uGpmvBS0_42 0 IT'S VERY SHARP
GC3uGpmvBS0_43 0 SO GOING TO BE SO CAREFUL
GC3uGpmvBS0_44 0 AND I OVER WATERED IT SO THE MOTHER PLANT ACTUALLY STARTED DYING ON ME
GC3uGpmvBS0_45 0 IT JUST TRYING TO MUCH
GC3uGpmvBS0_46 0 SO I JUST BROKE OFF THE TOP PARTS OF THE CACTUS
GC3uGpmvBS0_47 0 BUT STILL LOOK GOOD
GC3uGpmvBS0_48 0 AND PUT THEM BACK DOWN IN THE DIRT
GC3uGpmvBS0_49 0 AND THERE NOW THEY'RE LIVING
GC3uGpmvBS0_50 0 EVEN WHEN YOU THINK YOU KILL THEM
GC3uGpmvBS0_51 0 HALF THE TIME YOU CAN STILL TAKE PARTS THAT ARE STILL ALIVE
GC3uGpmvBS0_52 0 AND PUT IT BACK DOWN INTO THE DIRT
GC3uGpmvBS0_53 0 AND THEY'LL GROW AGAIN
GC3uGpmvBS0_54 0 THAT'S WHY LEVEL SO MUCH
GC3uGpmvBS0_55 0 SO I FOUND TO IF THEY GET TOO BIG OR THEY START FALLING OVER
GC3uGpmvBS0_56 0 YOU CAN GIVE THEM A LITTLE BIT OF A HAIRCUT TOO
GC3uGpmvBS0_57 0 AND THESE ARE SO SHARP YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO CAREFUL
GC3uGpmvBS0_58 0 BUT LIKE ON THIS ONE WHEN YOU BREAK IT
GC3uGpmvBS0_59 0 IT ACTUALLY MAKES KIND OF
GC3uGpmvBS0_60 0 IT GETS REALLY CUTE LIKE ELMER'S GLUE
GC3uGpmvBS0_61 0 SO THE REAL DANGER THAT YOU HAVE A CACTUS IS WATERING THEM TOO MUCH
GC3uGpmvBS0_62 0 SO WHEN IN DOUBT DON'T WATER
GC3uGpmvBS0_63 0 THAT'S BEEN MY RULE OF THUMB
GC3uGpmvBS0_64 0 AND I ONLY WATER THEM MAYBE ONCE A MONTH IF THAT
GC3uGpmvBS0_65 0 AND IN THE WINTER TIME MAYBE ONLY ONCE EVERY TWO MONTHS
GC3uGpmvBS0_66 0 AND THAT KIND OF LOOK AT THEM OR PUT MY FINGER INTO THE DIRT
GC3uGpmvBS0_67 0 AND YOU CAN KIND OF SEE IF THEY'RE WET ENOUGH OR NOT
GC3uGpmvBS0_68 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO BE REALLY WET
GC3uGpmvBS0_69 0 YOU WANT TO BE A LITTLE BIT ON THE DRY SIDE
GC3uGpmvBS0_70 0 SO THAT THEY'LL DO REALLY WELL
GC3uGpmvBS0_71 0 AND EVEN IF THEY DO DIE I TRY NOT TO TAKE IT PERSONALLY
GC3uGpmvBS0_72 0 BECAUSE YOU CAN ALWAYS GET AND YOU START OFF WITH ANOTHER ONE
GC3uGpmvBS0_73 0 AND THEY'RE SO EASY TO GROW
gedN9seQewQ_1 0 HI MY NAME IS ASHLEY LUDMAN FROM SEASIDE YOGA HERE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PILATES MATS
gedN9seQewQ_2 0 SO PULL OFF THESE IF YOU ARE PRACTICING ON THE MAT FORM OF PILATES YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL MAT
gedN9seQewQ_3 0 BECAUSE MANY OF THE THE EXERCISES YOU'LL BE ON THE MAT LYING DOWN SUCH AS AS THIS
gedN9seQewQ_4 0 AND IF YOU'RE ON YOUR BACK AND YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CUSHION SOME OF THE EXERCISES MIGHT BE A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR YOU
gedN9seQewQ_5 0 SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT AT MATS THAT WILL HELP YOU HOLD YOUR YOUR VARIOUS ALIGNMENTS AND EVEN WORK WITH AND ARTICULATED ACTION SO YOU'RE MOVING YOUR SPINE BONE BY BONE UPWARD TO WHERE YOU HAVE SOME SOME CUSHION UNDERNEATH YOU
gedN9seQewQ_6 0 DEPENDING ON ON HOW MUCH CAUSE SHE NEED ON IS GOING TO DEPEND ON YOUR COMFORT LEVEL
gedN9seQewQ_7 0 SO IF YOU'RE A LITTLE LESS PADDED YOURSELF YOU MAY WANT TO GO WITH THE MAT THAT HAS A LITTLE GREATER CUSHION
gedN9seQewQ_8 0 OR DOUBLE UP A COUPLE OF OF TRADITIONAL YOGA MATS WORK OR THREE EVEN TO GIVE YOU THAT THAT GREATER CUSHION
gedN9seQewQ_9 0 AND BECAUSE IN PILATES MAT WORK YOU'LL ALSO BE DOING SOME SOME POSTURES WHILE YOU'RE WHERE YOU'LL BE ON YOUR HANDS AND FEET IN VARIOUS WAYS YOU WILL NOT WANT TO HAVE SOME TRACTION SEAL THE SLIDING ALL OVER THE FLOOR
gedN9seQewQ_10 0 SO THOSE ARE MY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PILATES MATS AND JUST TO HELP YOU FIND ONE THAT YOU ENJOY
hbdvde0dTG0_1 0 HI I'M GAIL HOFFMAN FROM REDINGTON BEACH FLORIDA AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO MAKE FOR YOU A BIG ALASKA
hbdvde0dTG0_2 0 OKAY SO OUR BASE ALASKA
hbdvde0dTG0_3 0 AND WE'RE READY TO PUT OUR MERINGUE ON OUR BACON MASCARA BASE
hbdvde0dTG0_4 0 AND I'M GOING TO START BY JUST COATING THE ICE CREAM IN CAKE WE'RE FROM THE RING LOOK AND
hbdvde0dTG0_5 0 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU BRING THE MERENGUE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE PAPER BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T IT'S GOING TO JUST SLIDE AROUND ON THE TOP OF YOUR CAKE THAT WILL NOT BE GOOD
hbdvde0dTG0_6 0 IF YOU HAVE TO KIND OF QUICKLY BECAUSE THE ICE CREAM JUST KEEPS THE ICING MELTS PASS ESPECIALLY IN A HOT LIGHTS
hbdvde0dTG0_7 0 SO WE'RE KIND OF SIMPLY THAT MAKE SURE YOU COAT OR
hbdvde0dTG0_8 0 AND MAKE SURE YOU CASING ENTIRE THING BECAUSE IT IS CREATING IT'S SORT OF INSULATION FOR THE ICE CREAM
hbdvde0dTG0_9 0 AND COMPLETELY COVERED YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IT BACK IN THE FREEZER
hbdvde0dTG0_10 0 YOU CAN NOT YOU CAN PUT IT IN THE FREEZER FOR UP TO A DAY AND THEN PUT IT IN THE OVEN RIGHT BEFORE YOU SERVE IT
hbdvde0dTG0_11 0 I'M GOING TO PUT IT IN AT LEAST FOR TWO HOURS TO GET IT NICE AND CHILLED AGAIN
GtOH4JSl2Ic_1 0 HI MY NAME IS KEVIN AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO USE A BELT SANDER ON SOME
GtOH4JSl2Ic_2 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO USE ABOUT CENTER ON THIS PIECE OF OAK HERE AND WITH THIS SET UP WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THIS IS A NICE A FLAT SURFACE AND TAKE THE REST OF THIS ROUGH DOWN TOWARD SMOOTH LIKE THE REST OF THIS
GtOH4JSl2Ic_3 0 IF FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO A JOINTER PLAIN OR YOU COULD USE ABOUT CENTER TO KEEP THE LEVEL AND SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THAT
GtOH4JSl2Ic_4 0 WHAT THIS SET UP YOU WANT TO BE SURE TO HAVE A GUARD CLAMP TO BEHIND A STOP CLAMP BEHIND THIS BOARD SO THAT WHEN THE BELL CENTERS ON HERE DOESN'T JUST FLY OFF BECAUSE THE BELT IS VERY POWERFUL TOOL AND WE'LL THROW THIS PIECE AROUND BUT WE'VE GOT THIS STOP HERE AND THAT'S GOING TO KEEP THIS IN PLACE AS WELL AS LET THE BELT SANDER GO COMPLETELY AND COVER THE WHOLE AREA OF THE PIECE OF WOOD HERE
GtOH4JSl2Ic_5 0 IF WE WERE ACTUALLY CLAMP TO THE PIECE IT WOULD BE ABLE TO SAND THAT
GtOH4JSl2Ic_6 0 SO THIS ALLOWS IS COMPLETE FREEDOM OF THE SURFACE OF THE WORK PIECE AND KEEPS IT FROM MOVING
GtOH4JSl2Ic_7 0 AND AS ALWAYS WHEN YOU OPERATE THE BELT SOONER YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO YOU WANT TO BE SURE TO USE A DUST MASK AND HEARING PROTECTION
GtOH4JSl2Ic_8 0 SO WHEN WE START SANDING THIS PIECE WITH THE BELT SANDER YOU WANT TO KEEP THE BELT SANDER MOVING AT ALL TIMES
GtOH4JSl2Ic_9 0 IT'S A VERY POWERFUL MACHINE AND SO YOU WANT TO KEEP IT MOVING NEVER RESTING IN ONE AREA BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE A DISH IF YOU JUST LET IT SIT ONE AREA SO WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON JUST KEEPING IT MOVING WITH THE GRAIN AND THEN WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL TAKE IT OFF WILL GET A MEASURE A FLAT SURFACE AND WE'LL CHECK AND SEE WHAT AREAS WHEN YOU TAKE MORE OFF OF
GtOH4JSl2Ic_10 0 AND WE CAN MAKE A MARK WITH THE PENCIL OR CHALK OR SOMETHING TO SHOW SO WHEN YOU TAKE OFF MORE BUT INITIALLY WE'RE JUST GOING TO GET STARTED AND START FLATTENING THIS AND THEN WE'LL REEVALUATED UNTIL WE GET A COMPLETELY FLAT
GtOH4JSl2Ic_11 0 ONCE WE'VE DONE SOME INITIAL BELT SANDING YOU'RE GOING TO GET A NICE GOOD FLAT STRAIGHT EDGE AND YOU'LL GET ALONG AND YOU GET A READING
GtOH4JSl2Ic_12 0 TAKE A LOOK AND SEE THAT IT'S TELLING YOU
GtOH4JSl2Ic_13 0 IT'LL BE HITTING THE HIGH POINTS AND SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GO ALONG AND WHEREVER THE HIGH POINTS ARE IS THE COLOR THOSE IN AND THAT WAY YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO TAKE OFF
GtOH4JSl2Ic_14 0 THIS IS BASICALLY WAS BEING WOULD STRINGS TOLD US HERE IS THAT WE WANT TO TAKE OFF MORE OFF ALL THE AREAS THAT WE'VE GOTTEN THIS SMOOTH SURFACE WHERE IT'S ROUGH WE NEED TO WAIT UNTIL WE TAKE THIS DOWN TO GET TO THE SAME LEVEL AS THAT
GtOH4JSl2Ic_15 0 AND THEN AS WE KEEP GOING IT'S GOING TO EVENTUALLY LEVEL ITSELF OUT
GtOH4JSl2Ic_16 0 SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY TO TELL AS YOU LEAVE THESE YOU'LL SEE THESE ROUGH SPOTS AND YOU'LL KNOW THAT YOU NEED TO TAKE OFF MORE BUT FIRST YOU GOT TO BRING THIS DOWN TO GET TO THE SAME LEVEL IS THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO SMOOTH OUT ALL IS ONE SCREW SURFACE
Gxep5Y6JuHo_1 0 OUR RIDER IN TRAINING HAS STILL HER SNAP FLUTTER SPLIT REINS AS WE WOULD GO TO COMPETITION WOULD PROBABLY PUT A MORE PERFORMANCE BIT AND OUR BARREL RAINES ON TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN HOLD OUR REINS SNUGGLY WITH A SHORT WRITING WITH ONE HAND ON THE REINS HER RIGHT HAND SO SHE'S USING THE LEFT AND FOR THE FLAG RETRIEVAL
Gxep5Y6JuHo_2 0 SHE'S GOING TO GO AROUND THE BARREL SHE'S GOING TO DO THIS AT THE JOG SO THAT SHE CAN BE SURE THAT SHE GIVES HER HORSE ENOUGH TO TO PRACTICE WITH IS MOST FOCUSED QUIET OPPORTUNITY

hcfCa5uY_eE_3 0 THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE THE SAME COLOR
hcfCa5uY_eE_4 0 WE'LL DO SOME GREENS
hcfCa5uY_eE_5 0 WE'RE GOING TO PUT A DOT OF GLUE WE'RE GOING TO FIND A PLACE ON THE FISH THAT CAN ACTUALLY HOLD THE GLUE AND HOLD THE EYES
hcfCa5uY_eE_6 0 I PUT THIS IN PLACE LIKE THIS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A GOOD FULLY I PUT IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THAT WAY SEQUENCE JUST MAKES A LITTLE BIT MORE REFLECTION FLAIR TO THE EYE
hcfCa5uY_eE_7 0 I WILL DO THE SAME THING TO THE OTHER SIDE
hcfCa5uY_eE_8 0 ADDING A LITTLE BIT OF GLUE THE GREEN SEQUENCE AND A LARGE GOOGLIE EYE
hcfCa5uY_eE_9 0 THAT IS GOING TO DRY CLEAR SO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF WE GET IT ON ANY PART OTHER PART OF OUR FISH
hcfCa5uY_eE_10 0 TRY TO LINE THEM UP A LITTLE BIT BUT REALLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR A PLACE THAT'S A SMOOTH SURFACE TO GLUE THEM ONTO
hcfCa5uY_eE_11 0 IF THEY DON'T STICK ORIGINALLY WITH THE GLUE CAN ALWAYS TAKE A SMALL PIECE OF MASKING TAPE OR SCOTCH TAPE TO HOLD THEM DOWN AND THAT SHOULD HOLD THEM IN PLACE UNTIL THEY'RE DRY
HDeJa9QSwKI_1 0 ALRIGHT SO WE'LL DO ANOTHER VARIATION OF OUR THREE HI HAT LISTS HERE IN THE BAR

HDeJa9QSwKI_9 0 SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK A CLOSER LOOK IT WITH MY HANDS WITH MY LEFT FOOT IS DOING FOR THAT PATTERN
HibeZ7jFGwc_1 0 OKAY IN THIS SECTION I'M GOING TO BE TEACHING YOU HOW TO CARVE A SKI TURN AS OPPOSED TO SWITCHING THE SKI TURN AROUND AND BEING KIND OF SLOPPY GOING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN
HibeZ7jFGwc_2 0 THE DIFFERENCE IS SET OF LANE SO MUCH PRESSURE ON THIS FOOT AND SWITCH YOUR BODY AROUND YOU'RE GOING TO PUT FOUR PRESSURE ON YOUR BOOT SO NOT ALLOW THE INSIDE EDGE OF THE SPEED WORK BY ITSELF AND CARVE THE TURN OUT
HibeZ7jFGwc_3 0 WHEN YOU'RE SHIFTING SPEED WHAT YOU DO IS YOU SHIFT THE WEIGHT TO THE FOUR PRESSURE OF THIS THROUGH AND IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU CARD THIS TURN OUT
HibeZ7jFGwc_4 0 PRETTY MUCH WHAT YOU WANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS PUTTING FORWARD PRESSURE AND ALLOWING THE SKI TO WORK WITH THAT WITH ITS ACTUAL SHAPE INSTEAD OF CHINA MUSCLE THE SKI AROUND LIKE BEFORE
HibeZ7jFGwc_5 0 THE REASON FOR USING A CARVING TURN AS OPPOSED TO THE BASIC SNOW SKIING TURN IS IT ALLOWS YOU TO CARRY MORE SPEED AND BE MORE FLUID AND IF YOU ARE PROGRESSING AND SEEN ON THIS STEEPER MORE ADVANCED SKI RUNS IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT DOWN THERE SAFELY
HibeZ7jFGwc_6 0 SO IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY DOES WANT TO LEARN AS OPPOSE TO SWITCH IN THEIR BODY SIDEWAYS BECAUSE IT'S JUST GOING TO MAKE IT ALL AROUND BATTERS HERE
HibeZ7jFGwc_7 0 PROBABLY THE MOST MORE AND CONTROL AND RESULTS HAVE MORE FUN WITH IT

HibeZ7jFGwc_10 0 AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE SWITCH IN OUR BODY AROUND A WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE LETTING THE SKIS WORK WITH THEIR NATURAL WITH THEIR NATURAL SHAPE
HibeZ7jFGwc_11 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS APPLY FOR PRESSURE TO THE BOOT THAT'S GOING TO BE A DOWNHILL SKI

HibeZ7jFGwc_13 0 I'M GOING TO MAKE IT A LEFT TILT ARE GOING TO BE A PLAN FOR PRESSURE TO YOUR LEFT IT
HibeZ7jFGwc_14 0 ALONG WITH THIS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STILT LIFTED TAKING OFF A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE OF YOUR UPHILL SKI
HibeZ7jFGwc_15 0 NOW I'M GOING TO BE MAKING SOME TURNS AND WALK YOU THROUGH IT AS I DO IT
HibeZ7jFGwc_16 0 IF YOU NOTICE I'M STARTING OFF WITH THE PROPER STANCE AND I'M GOING TO BE APPLYING FORWARD PRESSURE TO THIS FOOT AND FOR PRESSURE TO THIS WAY
HibeZ7jFGwc_17 0 IT'S GOING TO BE MAKING A SMOOTH CERTAIN AS OPPOSED TO SWITCH MY BODY AROUND
HibeZ7jFGwc_18 0 IF YOU'LL NOTICE YOU CAN SEE THE SKI THE STRAPS TO WHERE I WENT AND IT'S A SMOOTH WINE RIGHT THERE NOT SWITCH YOU MY BODY AROUND IS GOING TO BE A LOT FASTER AND A LOT MORE EFFECTIVE WAY TO SKI

HhWkohEcvlI_6 0 SO JUST LIFTING THE BALL UP IN THE AIR POPPING IT UP AND IT PRETTY MUCH ALLOWS US TO BE BOUNCING AFTER THAT
HhWkohEcvlI_7 0 SO IT'S GOING TO SHOW THAT ONE MORE TIME
HhWkohEcvlI_8 0 JUST POPPING IT IN THE AIR AND JUST LIKE THAT
HhWkohEcvlI_9 0 ONCE THE BALLS IN THE AIR AND WE'RE GOING TO REPEAT THAT MOTION OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND POPPING UP AND WATCHING AS IT COMES DOWN
HhWkohEcvlI_10 0 IT CAN DEFINITELY REACT DIFFERENTLY IT'S HITTING DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CLUB RIGHT IN THE CENTER SPOT THAT SWEET SPOT
HhWkohEcvlI_11 0 IT WILL POP WAY UP THE AIR AND AS IT HITS THE OTHER PARTS OF THE CLUB IT MIGHT NOT BOUNCE UP AS HIGH BUT YOU CAN DEFINITELY GAIN A FEW OF HOW HIGH IT'S GOING TO BE BOUNCING AND THE KIND OF WHAT DIRECTIONS CAN BE GOING BY WHERE IT'S ON THE BASE OF THE CLUB
Gdb4bt99e9s_1 0 IN THIS SECTION I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT GAME NUMBER FIVE
Gdb4bt99e9s_2 0 IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO GAME NUMBER FOUR BUT IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT OUT
Gdb4bt99e9s_3 0 INSTEAD OF THEM JUST HOLDING THEIR BREATH UNDER WATER AND PULLING ON THE WALL NOW IF YOU JUST TELL THEM SUPERMAN STYLE
Gdb4bt99e9s_4 0 SO WE ALL KNOW WHAT'S SUPERMAN IS SEALED I'LL SHOW YOU HERE IN A BIT
Gdb4bt99e9s_5 0 YOU JUST KIND OF HAVE YOUR OUT HANDS OUT LIKE AN AIRPLANE ARE OUT IN FRONT OF YOU AND YOUR LEGS STRAIGHT OUT
Gdb4bt99e9s_6 0 AND YOU MAY WANT TO HELP THEM WITH SUPPORT ON THIS ONE DEFINITELY A LITTLE BIT
Gdb4bt99e9s_7 0 OR IF THEY CAN FLOAT THAT BE GREAT
Gdb4bt99e9s_8 0 BUT IF YOU NEED TO JUST KIND OF HOLDING BY THE WAIST AND TELL THEM TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND SHOW THEM THEY'RE SUPERMAN GLIDE YOU KNOW LIKE SUPERMAN FLYING OR WHATNOT AND YOU KNOW
Gdb4bt99e9s_9 0 SEE HOW WHEN THEY CAN DO IT FOR
Gdb4bt99e9s_10 0 AND HAVE THEM DO IT A COUPLE OF TIMES
Gdb4bt99e9s_11 0 AND IF THERE'S OTHER KIDS AROUND HAVE THEM ALL DO IT
Gdb4bt99e9s_12 0 AND IF YOU HAVE TO AGAIN REMEMBER TO SUPPORT THEM AROUND THE WAIST SO THAT THEY DON'T YOU KNOW GET UNDERNEATH THE WATER FOR TOO LONG OR GET WATER IN THEIR NOSE
Gdb4bt99e9s_13 0 ALWAYS REMIND THEM TO BLOW A LITTLE BIT OF AIR OUTSIDE OF THE NOSE
Gdb4bt99e9s_14 0 SO THAT'S GAME NUMBER FIVE
Gdb4bt99e9s_15 0 AS THEY ARE IN THE SUPERMAN POSITION YOU HAVE ANOTHER KIT OR ANYBODY BROTHER BY THE WAIST WHICH IS SWIRLING OR ON THE WATER TO MAKE THEM ALL AROUND
Gdb4bt99e9s_16 0 SO THE PERSON TO BE THE CHARACTER TENSE LIKE THIS SUPERMAN AND THEY ARE LITERALLY JUST GLIDE INTO THE WATER LINE TO THE WATER
Gdb4bt99e9s_17 0 THAT'S THE GAME
hhjISQhs4NY_1 0 HI THIS IS YOLANDA VANVEEN FROM VANVEEN BULBS DOT COM
hhjISQhs4NY_2 0 NEXT WE'RE GOING TO LEARN ALL ABOUT HOW TO GROW HOSTAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHADE PLANTS
hhjISQhs4NY_3 0 HOSTAS OR A BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL SHADE PLANT BECAUSE THEY'LL GROW SO EASILY IN THE SHADE
hhjISQhs4NY_4 0 MY TRICK IS THEY CAN HANDLE TOO MUCH SHADE EITHER SO IF YOU HAVE AN AREA WHERE WEEDS WON'T GROW IN THERE'S ONLY MONSTER PINE NEEDLES DON'T EVEN TRY TO DRAW STRING
hhjISQhs4NY_5 0 BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF A SHADY AREA WHERE REEDS ARE COMING UP OR BULBS ARE COMING UP OR YOU HAVE ANY OTHER FERNS GROWING THAN HOSTAS WILL GROW REALLY WELL THERE AND THEY'RE JUST EASY TO GROW
hhjISQhs4NY_6 0 THEY'RE JUST A ROOT WITH A LOT OF LEAKS AND THEY MULTIPLY QUICKLY SO HOSTAS ARE REALLY EASY TO GROW
hhjISQhs4NY_7 0 BASICALLY THEY COME AS A ROOT WITH PART OF A STEM AND WHEN YOU DIVIDE THEM OUT THAT'S ALL YOU NEED IS PART OF A RUDE WITH THE STEM AND SO YOU JUST PLANT IT ABOUT SOMETHING ABOUT THREE INCHES DEEP SO THE STEM IS BARELY OUT OF THE GROUND
hhjISQhs4NY_8 0 PUT IT IN A SHADY SPOT AND DO REALLY WELL
hhjISQhs4NY_9 0 AND GET LOTS OF WATER TO START
hhjISQhs4NY_10 0 THEY REALLY WANT TO DRINK SOME WATER
hhjISQhs4NY_11 0 THEY DON'T WANT TO DRY OUT TO THE BONE IS IF IT'S JUST REALLY REALLY DRY SOMETIMES YOU'LL LOSE THEM BUT I'VE HAD SOME OF THEM JUST DIE BACK BECAUSE YOU QUICK WATERING THEM IN ITS MAYBE TOO MUCH SUN AND THEN WHEN IT RAINS IN THE FALL TO COME RIGHT BACK UP
hhjISQhs4NY_12 0 SO WITH THAT SAID THEY'RE EASY PLANTS YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH GROWN ANYWHERE SURVIVAL THE FIST
hhjISQhs4NY_13 0 I'VE PUT THEM IN THE HOT SUN AND THEY THRIVE THERE AS WELL BECAUSE THEY WERE NEAR RHODODENDRON GOT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SHAPE
hhjISQhs4NY_14 0 SO TEST AMOUNT YOU CAN GROW I'M ALMOST ANYWHERE
hhjISQhs4NY_15 0 GOOD COMPOST THAT SOIL OR GOOD POTTING SOILS THE BEST MIX FOR THEM
hhjISQhs4NY_16 0 THEY LOVE RAISED BEDS THAT THEY'LL DO GREAT UNDERNEATH TREES
hhjISQhs4NY_17 0 ONE THING I'VE KNOWN ABOUT HOSTAS TOO BECAUSE THEY ARE USUALLY IN THE SHADE IN THE SUMMER TIME WHEN MY TREES ARE REALLY FULL OF LEAVES I HAVE TO WATER I'M PRETTY WELL BUT IN THE WINTER TIME WHEN THE THEY LOOSER LEAVES THEY PRETTY MUCH GET WATER ON THEIR OWN SO THERE'S KIND OF TIMES IN THE SPRING IN THE FALL OR YOU DO HAVE TO WATCH EVEN IF IT'S RAINING OUTSIDE THAT YOU DO GIVE HIM SOME WATER BECAUSE THEY'LL STILL DRY OUT IF THEY'RE NOT GETTING ANY WATERING CAN LOSE AND EVEN IN THE SPRING OR THE FOAM
hhjISQhs4NY_18 0 WHAT'S OR ESTABLISHED YOU'LL NEVER LOSE THEM AND YOU'LL HAVE THEM FOR YEARS AND YEARS

gmAQ34kpTsQ_6 0 SO I CAN DO IS MADE OF A BRING IT UP FIVE
gmAQ34kpTsQ_7 0 IT'S ALL FLY IT NOW PRESS PLAY
gmAQ34kpTsQ_9 0 SO IT'S PRETTY EASY TO THE OTHER TRANSPOSE
gmAQ34kpTsQ_10 0 THAT FROM WHERE EVERYTHING WAS WHAT I CAN ALSO DO IS TO APPLY THE NOTES SO I HAVE A CERTAIN NO I CAN BRING IT DOWN TO IT
GRiR2nV8a0M_1 0 SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET READY TO DO THE FINGER STICK THAT ACTUALLY IS GOING TO PRODUCE THE SAMPLE WILL BE COLLECTING
GRiR2nV8a0M_2 0 THIS SEEMS TO BE THE MOST INTIMIDATING PART OF OF SOME HOME TESTING KITS FOR PEOPLE
GRiR2nV8a0M_3 0 IT'S IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HIV IF THAT'S YOUR IMPETUS FOR TAKING THE TEST
GRiR2nV8a0M_4 0 IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT TAKING A TINY NEEDLE IN JABBING IT INTO THE SIDE OF YOUR FINGER DROP WHAT REALLY IS OFF PUTTING TO PEOPLE

GRiR2nV8a0M_8 0 THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO WHEN SELECTING IS TO PICK YOUR OFFHAND OF COURSE
GRiR2nV8a0M_9 0 YOU'LL NEED YOUR DOMINANT HAND IS TO USE THE LANCET AND THE EQUIPMENT TO COLLECT THE BLOOD
GRiR2nV8a0M_10 0 AND THE DRAW AREA WE'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON IS ON EITHER YOUR MIDDLE OR RING FINGER TO THE SIDES OF THE PAD OF A FINGER
GRiR2nV8a0M_11 0 YOU COULD USE YOUR FIRST FINGER BUT IT'S GENERALLY THE MOST CALLOUSED OF ALL YOUR FINGERS
GRiR2nV8a0M_12 0 AND CALLUSES AREN'T PLACES FOR BLOOD FLOWS
GRiR2nV8a0M_13 0 SO THERE'S NO POINT IN POKING OR CALLISON TRYING TO DROP BLOOD
GRiR2nV8a0M_14 0 ONCE YOU'VE SELECTED YOUR SITE YOU SUGAR WASH AND DRY YOUR HANDS THOROUGHLY
GRiR2nV8a0M_15 0 NOT ONLY IS THIS ENSURE THAT BOTH THE HANDS OF USING ARE CLEAN THE ACTION OF WASHING YOUR HANDS AND THE WARM WATER WILL STIMULATE THE BLOOD FLOW TO YOUR HANDS PRODUCING A BETTER SAMPLE
GRiR2nV8a0M_16 0 ONCE YOU'VE DECIDED WHERE YOU WANT TO STICK GO AHEAD AND GET YOUR SAMPLE CARD OPEN AND HAVE THAT READY TO DROP THE BLOOD ON
GRiR2nV8a0M_17 0 OPEN UP THE ALCOHOL PREP AND WIPE THE AIR YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING THE LANCET ON
GRiR2nV8a0M_18 0 AND TAKE A DEEP BREATH
GRiR2nV8a0M_19 0 GET THE LANCET READY TO GO AND JUST POP YOURSELF
GRiR2nV8a0M_20 0 IT'S REALLY REALLY SIMPLE
GRiR2nV8a0M_21 0 IT'S NOT ALL SCARY

G6_EhinHPow_3 0 BUT I'VE LEARNED SOME TRICKS OVER THE YEARS TO MAKE SOME NICE FLUFFY ONCE OF MY ON THE TRICK IS TO INCORPORATE AIR INTO THE WET INGREDIENTS THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS USING A BLENDER OR A A REGULAR BLENDER OR HAND BLENDER
G6_EhinHPow_4 0 LET'S DO IT FIRST WE'RE GOING TO CRACK OUR EGGS INTO A SEPARATE CONTAINER AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY SHELLS LIKE THAT
G6_EhinHPow_5 0 OR YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S PRETTY GOOD AND THEN PUT THAT RIGHT INTO THE BLENDER AND THAT'S FOR A EGGS AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD A QUARTER CUP OF WATER FOR OUR QUARTER CUP OF OIL THE TRADITIONAL OIL TO USE WOULD BE SCHMALTZ SCHMULTS IS A RENDERED CHICKEN FAT IT'S NOT SO HEALTHY SO I LIKE TO USE A MIXTURE OF OLIVE OIL AND CANOLA OIL IT'S TWO TABLESPOONS OF OLIVE OIL AND TWO TABLESPOONS OF CANOLA OIL
G6_EhinHPow_6 0 I JUST ADDED A PINCH OF WHITE PEPPER AND TO TAKE TWO TEASPOONS TWO TEASPOONS OF SALT NOW I'M GOING TO BLEND THAT UP UNTIL IT'S A LIGHT AND AIRY
gljUBiQSXec_1 0 I'VE DONE ON THE TAIL AND THESE ARE SPELLING TRAPS FOR YOUR DARK WORLD DECK
gljUBiQSXec_2 0 I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO FABRICS
gljUBiQSXec_3 0 THIS IS A NORMAL SPELL SPEED ONE SPELL CARD
gljUBiQSXec_4 0 IT'S A FACT LETS YOU TAKE FIVE MONSTER CUTS FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD SHUFFLE THEM INTO YOUR DECK AND DRAW TWO CARDS
gljUBiQSXec_5 0 THIS CAN BE ESPECIALLY KEY LATE GAME WHEN YOU HAVE ALL YOUR DARK WORLD MONSTERS IN THE GRAVEYARD AND KNOW THAT YOU WON'T BE DRAWING ANYMORE THEM
gljUBiQSXec_6 0 YOU'LL BE ABLE TO RECYCLE THE FIVE MONSTER CARDS THAT YOU NEED INTO YOUR DECK MAYBE A MORPHING JAR GOLD STILL OUT AND THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DRAW TWO CARDS
gljUBiQSXec_7 0 THESE TWO CARDS MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED OR IT MIGHT BE A DARK WILL DEALINGS OR IT MIGHT BE LIGHTING VORTEX
gljUBiQSXec_8 0 THE GOOD THING ABOUT POT OF ADDRESS IS THAT YOU DRAW TWO CARDS SO IF YOU DROP POT OF ADDRESS AND YOU HAD NO CARDS BEFORE YOU'LL STILL BE DRAWING ONE MORE CAR THAT YOU CAN THEN USE TO USE LIGHTNING VORTEX
gljUBiQSXec_9 0 OR YOU COULD DRAW DARK WILL DEALINGS
gljUBiQSXec_10 0 THE LAST TWO CARDS TO USE WITH IT
gljUBiQSXec_11 0 YOU WON'T HAVE TO PREY OR HOLD OR WISH FOR A DARK WORLD MONSTER OFF THE TOP OF YOUR DECK
gljUBiQSXec_12 0 YOU MIGHT HAVE ONE IN THE HAND TO USE WITH IT
gljUBiQSXec_13 0 IT DOES NOT WORK HOWEVER IF YOUR OPPONENT DD CURLS ONE OF YOUR TARGETS
gljUBiQSXec_14 0 YOU ONLY HAVE FOUR MONSTERS AND THE EFFECT WILL FIST
gljUBiQSXec_15 0 YOU GOTTA BE SURE WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY TRICKS
hcqybw2ISH4_1 0 ALRIGHT SO WE WENT OVER SOME REALLY BASIC BASIC BASIC THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT SAFETY BEFORE YOU START PRACTICING STAGE COMBAT
hcqybw2ISH4_2 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO SAFETY IN BETWEEN THE IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO BE THE ATTACKER AND SHAUN MY ASSISTANT HERE HE'S GOING TO BE THE ATTACKEE NOW SOME
hcqybw2ISH4_3 0 THE TWO BASIC THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE YOU START TO DO ANY KIND OF LIKE PUNCHING OR SLAPPING MOVE OUR ESTABLISHING DISTANCE AND ESTABLISHING EYE CONTACT BETWEEN THE PERSON YOU'RE ACTING WITH
hcqybw2ISH4_4 0 SO IF I WAS GOING TO GO UP AND I WANT TO SLAP SHAUN IN THE FACE WHICH WILL BE LEARNING IN JUST A SECOND AFTER WE WERE NAPS IS I WANT TO ESTABLISH A SAFE DISTANCE BETWEEN MEAN SHINE
hcqybw2ISH4_5 0 SO WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WERE GOING TO COME UP LIKE IF I WAS GOING TO WALK UP THE SHINE BE LIKE HEY I'M GOING TO SLAP YOU IN THE FACE SHAUN
hcqybw2ISH4_6 0 I WOULD GO UP AND I WOULD PUT MY HANDS ON THE SHOULDERS JUST LIKE THAT TO ESTABLISH A SAFE DISTANCE
hcqybw2ISH4_7 0 THAT WAY I'M NOT TOO CLOSE OR I'M NOT TOO FAR AWAY SO THAT IT DOESN'T LOOK REAL
hcqybw2ISH4_8 0 THE NEXT THING YOU'RE GOING TO DO AFTER YOU'VE ESTABLISHED A SAFE DISTANCE IS YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE EYE CONTACT
hcqybw2ISH4_9 0 THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THE CUE BETWEEN YOU AND THE OTHER ACTOR YOU'RE WORKING WITH
hcqybw2ISH4_10 0 IT'S THE CUE TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO AND AGAIN INVENTION BOLT KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU'RE GOING TO DO
hcqybw2ISH4_11 0 NEVER DO THIS NOT KNOWING IS GOING TO BE VERY AND SAY IF AND SOMEONE'S GOING TO GET HURT
hcqybw2ISH4_12 0 SO THOSE ARE THE TWO BASIC THINGS TO KNOW THE ESTABLISHING DISTANCE AND THE CUE BETWEEN THE TWO ACTORS THAT LET YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE READY TO START PUNCHING SWAN
gNmCeE_tT48_1 0 THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GAMES
gNmCeE_tT48_2 0 HENCE ONE GAME IS A VARIATION THE MOST POPULAR FORM OF THE GAME THAT'S PLAYED TODAY AND WE'LL BE COMING TO THAT IN THE NEXT SESSION IS CALLED BID WHIST WITH KITTY
gNmCeE_tT48_3 0 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRAIT WHIST IN BID WHIST IS THAT IN STRAIT WHIST THERE ARE NO JOKERS WE DO NOT USE JOKERS AND STRAIT WHIST
gNmCeE_tT48_4 0 NUMBER TWO WE DO NOT HAVE A KITTY
gNmCeE_tT48_5 0 THE KITTY VERY SIMILAR TO EUCHRE IS A LIKE A DISCARD PILE
gNmCeE_tT48_6 0 FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WOULD DEALING OUT THE CARDS WHICH IS DEAL NOT REAL QUICK THEY WOULD BE A POINT IN TIME THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE FOUR CARDS IN THE KITTY PLUS THE JOKERS THAT'S THE KITTY
gNmCeE_tT48_7 0 STRAIT WHIST WE DEAL OUT ALL THE CARDS
gNmCeE_tT48_8 0 EVERYBODY STARTS WITH THIRTEEN CARDS
gNmCeE_tT48_9 0 SO THAT IS THE BASIC DIFFERENCE
gNmCeE_tT48_10 0 OTHERWISE THE TERMS UPTOWN AND DOWNTOWN WILL COME INTO THE PLAY
gNmCeE_tT48_11 0 FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GAMES STRAIT WHIST ALL CARDS ARE DEALT ALL CARDS ARE IN PLAY IN BID WHIST KITTY WHIST SIX CARDS INCLUDING THE JOKERS AROUND THE KITTY SO YOU HAVE A MUCH MORE LIKELY AND COMPETITIVE OPTION

GY_XmNhupPo_4 0 NOW I OPEN THE VALVE AND PUSH DOWN ON THE AIR COMES UP SO I WILL IT ALL THE AIR OUT
GY_XmNhupPo_5 0 MAKES A TAKES AWHILE SOMETIMES IT HELPS IF I PUSH DOWN ON THE TIRE IF YOU LOOK HERE UP OR COME OUT A LITTLE BIT QUICKER
GY_XmNhupPo_6 0 AS YOU CAN HEAR IT STILL COMING OUT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE PRETTY GOOD

GfHucOeFuzE_3 0 SO WE'VE GOT HERE IN NYC CONTI TWO HUNDRED
GfHucOeFuzE_4 0 WHEN YOU'RE SHOOTING JEWELRY THERE'S NUMBER THINGS YOU NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT WITH YOUR CAMERA SETTINGS
GfHucOeFuzE_5 0 NUMBER ONE IS YOUR FILM SPEED OR ISO
GfHucOeFuzE_6 0 YOU WANT TO BE IS LOWEST POSSIBLE IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO USE I STILL ONE HUNDRED
GfHucOeFuzE_7 0 THAT GIVES YOU THE MOST DETAIL AND THE LEAST NOISE
GfHucOeFuzE_8 0 SINCE YOU'RE SHOOTING IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT YOU CAN ADJUST THE LIGHT IT ALLOWS YOU TO GO TO A LOWER ISO
GfHucOeFuzE_9 0 THE SECOND THING YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS YOUR APERTURE OR
GfHucOeFuzE_10 0 THAT'S GOING TO CONTROL HOW MUCH DEPTH OF FIELD OR HOW MUCH OF YOUR TOP PIECE OF JEWELRY IS IN FOCUS
GfHucOeFuzE_11 0 YOU WILL TEND TO WANT TO GO WITH A SMALLER APERTURE WHICH GIVES YOU MORE DEPTH OF FIELD SOMETHING SAY THIRTEEN OR SIXTEEN YOU MAY EVEN WANT TO GO UP TOWARDS TWENTY TWO ALTHOUGH I DON'T LIKE GOING THAT HIGH BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU'LL GET SOME OF THE LIGHT TO THE FLAX A LITTLE BIT AND IT MAKES THE PICTURE A LITTLE FUZZIER
GfHucOeFuzE_12 0 SO YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT YOUR EYES SO YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT YOUR SHUTTER SPEED AS WELL YOU WANT TO SHOOT MANUAL
GfHucOeFuzE_13 0 DON'T USE THE PROGRAM MODE
GfHucOeFuzE_14 0 SHOULD ON MANUAL AND YOU'LL HAVE TO A WORKOUT THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR WHAT YOUR THE PROPER SHUTTER SPEED IS

hbtksI9ewLk_4 0 YOUR CUE BALL STARTS IN THE SAME PLACE
hbtksI9ewLk_5 0 IT'S ALL WHAT'S CALLED THE FOOT SPOT OF THE TABLE
hbtksI9ewLk_6 0 IN OTHER WORDS A CENTER THE TABLE THIS WAY AND THE SECOND TIME AND UP
hbtksI9ewLk_7 0 YOUR OBJECT BALL STARTS RIGHT IN THE CENTER THE TABLE
hbtksI9ewLk_8 0 YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO KICK THE BALL IN EITHER ONE OF THESE TWO POCKETS FROM THAT SET UP
hbtksI9ewLk_9 0 THAT'S WHERE WE WANT TO START
hbtksI9ewLk_10 0 SO WE'RE BACK TO IDENTIFYING OUR ANGLE INTO THE CUSHION OUT ONCE AGAIN TO HIT THIS BALL
hbtksI9ewLk_11 0 SO WE WOULD IDENTIFY THAT IS A SPOT RIGHT ABOUT THERE
hbtksI9ewLk_12 0 NOW YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED
hbtksI9ewLk_13 0 IT WENT LONG
hbtksI9ewLk_14 0 I I HIT IT TOO THIN AND IT WILL BE ON THE POCKET
hbtksI9ewLk_15 0 BUT THIS IS REALLY GOOD PRACTICE RIGHT HERE BECAUSE NOW WE'RE GOING TO KICK IT THE BALL
hbtksI9ewLk_16 0 AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE TRYING TO CONTROL THE SPEED TO COME BACK AND JUST GENTLY NURSE IT UP IN FRONT OF THE POCKET SO THAT WE GET IT INTO THE EASY SCORING POSITION SO THAT WE CAN GO BACK AND FORTH ONCE AGAIN
hbtksI9ewLk_17 0 SO WE'RE REALLY GETTING A LOT OF BENEFIT OUT OF THIS DRILL
hbtksI9ewLk_18 0 SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK
hbtksI9ewLk_19 0 NEXT STROKE WOULD BE LIKE SUCH
hbtksI9ewLk_20 0 NOW IT'S A PRETTY GOOD SCORING POSITION DEPENDING ON HOW WELL I CAN KICK
hbtksI9ewLk_21 0 SO MY OBJECTIVE NOW IS COME OVER HERE WITH THE ANGLE THAT I NEED TO THEN KICK THE BALL INTO THIS POCKET
hbtksI9ewLk_22 0 AND THEN OF COURSE I MISSED
hbtksI9ewLk_23 0 I HAD A STROKE
hbtksI9ewLk_24 0 BUT I KEEP COUNTING STROKES UNTIL I POCKET AND EITHER ONE OF THESE POCKETS
hbtksI9ewLk_25 0 AND AGAIN I WANT TO WRITE DOWN THAT SCORE KEEP A LOG SO THAT I CAN ADD THEM ALL UP AND THEN KEEP BUT AN AVERAGE
hbtksI9ewLk_26 0 AND THEN DATE TODAY I WANT MY AVERAGE TO COME DOWN TO THE VERY LAST POINT
hbtksI9ewLk_27 0 THAT'S ONE I'LL KNOW THAT I'M BECOMING A BETTER AT KICKING IT BALLS

GRkwQcHdRd4_6 0 BUT BASICALLY MEANS IS THAT WE WANT TO CREATE A SOUND FROM A GUITAR THAT MIGHT MAKE A VOICE OR A VIOLIN
GRkwQcHdRd4_7 0 IT'S A SUSTAINING SOUND ONE THAT DOESN'T STOP WHERE SOMEONE WHEN WE PLUCK A GUITAR
GRkwQcHdRd4_8 0 IT'S A SHORTS ON THE DYES OFF
GRkwQcHdRd4_9 0 SO WE ACHIEVE THAT BY GETTING THIS KIND OF ROLL ON FIRST IN THE FINGER PICKING STYLE WITH OUR FINGERS WHERE WE TAKE OUR RING MIDDLE AND END X AND REPEAT THEM ON A STRING
GRkwQcHdRd4_10 0 WE CAN ALTERNATE OUR THUMB ON A DIFFERENT STRING IF WE WANTED AND WOULD COME OUT LIKE THIS
GRkwQcHdRd4_11 0 SO YOU CAN HEAR IT KIND OF BRINGS A MORE SUSTAINS SOUND
GRkwQcHdRd4_12 0 NOW WE CAN ALSO DO THIS ON AN ELECTRIC GUITAR OR ANY TYPE OF GUITAR WORRY BE USING A PICK
GRkwQcHdRd4_13 0 IN THIS CASE WE WE COULD BE PLAYING THE SAME STRINGS
GRkwQcHdRd4_14 0 BASICALLY IT'S JUST A MATTER OF MOVING THE PICK BACK AND FORTH VERY QUICKLY SO WE WOULD DO IT IS REALLY A WRIST MOTION THAT WE USE
GRkwQcHdRd4_15 0 WE'RE UP TO IT SO IT CAN BE DONE BOTH WAYS THE TERM TRAMMELL MEANS A SHORT FAST REPEATING NOTE TO CREATE THAT SUSTAINED SOUND
GBb7UcYQizc_1 0 NOW WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS INVOLVING YOU'RE DRIBBLING SKILLS AND INTO MAKING TRICKS
GBb7UcYQizc_2 0 AND BASICALLY WHAT I WANT TO TELL YOU FIRST OF ALL I'M DOING TRICKS IS THE KEY IS YOU HAVE TO BE LOOSE YOU HAVE TO BE VERY RELAXED AND YOU HAVE TO BE ON YOUR TOES
GBb7UcYQizc_3 0 SO YOU CAN MAKE A QUICK MOVES IN QUICK DECISIONS
GBb7UcYQizc_4 0 SO EVERYTHING THAT I'VE TAUGHT YOU IS IS A COMMON A USING COMBINATIONS TO MAKE TRICKS THAT YOU'VE GOT CUTS YOU'VE GOT THE ROLL OVER AND AND ALSO THERE IS THE BASIC TRICK OF OF THE STEP OVER
GBb7UcYQizc_5 0 WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT THAT IS IS THAT IT'S A FAKE JUST A FAKE TO ONE SIDE SO THEY THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GO THAT WAY BUT THE BALL IS GOING TO KEEP DRAWING THE SAME WAY AND YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT
gMJe2MJJP7E_1 0 THERE'S NO IT'S ON THIS IS KIND OF THE DEMONSTRATE THAT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WEAPONS CONNECTOR WHETHER IT'S A KNIFE A GEL LIKE UP THE FIVE FOOT STAFF OR SWORD OR IF IT'S EMPTY HAND ATTACK WITH THE TO GRAB OR A STRIKE ANYTHING TECHNIQUE THAT WE'VE GOT AN IDEAL CAN BE APPLIED TO WHATEVER SITUATION
gMJe2MJJP7E_2 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK AND DO THE SAME TECHNIQUE BUT REAPPLY TO A GEL
gMJe2MJJP7E_3 0 LAST THING WE DID SO MANY NOW YOUR WITH THE KNIFE TAKE AWAY THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE BASIC AGILITY OR OR JOE TAKE OFF THE EDGES
gMJe2MJJP7E_4 0 SO AGAIN SO COMBINING EVEN UGLY
gMJe2MJJP7E_5 0 DANIEL'S IS GOING TO COME IN WITH THE SKI
gMJe2MJJP7E_6 0 AS HE DOES OBVIOUSLY NEED TO GET OFF LINE
gMJe2MJJP7E_7 0 I WANT TO TAP KEEPING ONE START WITH MY HANDS AS FAR APART THEN PUT ONE ON IT AND GET IN AS DEEP AS YOU CAN THEN WANT TO SLIDE IN GET MY OTHER HAND OVER THE TOP
gMJe2MJJP7E_8 0 BASE THE SAME DIRECTION BRING THIS UP AND STRETCH WITH MY ARMS UP
gMJe2MJJP7E_9 0 THAT IS THE DINNER SKIS ON THIS SIDE I WANT TO ENTER SEE IF I CAN GET IN AS DEEP AS THEY CAN GET THIS OVER THE TOP RAISE UP A STRETCH THE ARMS
gMJe2MJJP7E_10 0 IT'S REALLY THE HIPS TURNING AT THE VERY END IT THERE
gMJe2MJJP7E_11 0 TRADITIONALLY WE WOULD AGAIN PLACE THE JOIN THE GROUND AND THEN WALK THROUGH OR WALK AWAY
gMJe2MJJP7E_12 0 FOR THE SUPPORT TEST NICE AND CLEAN IT
gMJe2MJJP7E_13 0 NEXT WOULD BE AN <UNK>
gMJe2MJJP7E_14 0 SO THAT ONE WAS VERY DIRECT OKAY
gMJe2MJJP7E_15 0 MAYBE WE COME IN AND WE CAN'T PUSH TANK ON CUT DOWN ON THE GREEN IT OKAY
gMJe2MJJP7E_16 0 SO AS HE COMES IN GET TO THE OUTSIDE MAYBE I CAN'T GO THIS WAY TUCKING TWIST WHEN YOU FIND SPACE FOR A GOOD STRETCH
gMJe2MJJP7E_17 0 I'M JUST GOING TO BE DOING A REGULAR PUNCH TECHNIQUE WE LOOK VERY SIMILAR NICE AND EASY AND THROUGH OKAY
gMJe2MJJP7E_18 0 IT'S THE EXACT SAME TECHNIQUE EVEN WITH THE SKEW LET'S DO THIS ON

Go2INfZ8Mtk_1 0 SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE AND A BETA COLOR HAS COME A LONG WAY WITHIN GRAY COVERAGE
Go2INfZ8Mtk_2 0 THE WAY THAT THE GRAY COVERAGE YOU USE TO WORK WITH THE BAY THAT IS THAT YOU HAD PURE TENS A BIGGER WORKS WITH THEN YOU HAVE YOUR TENDS TO MIX THE NATURAL SHAPE
Go2INfZ8Mtk_3 0 I'M NOT GOING TO GET TO TECHNICAL
Go2INfZ8Mtk_4 0 BASICALLY WHAT YOU HAVE A SECURE TONE WHICH IS IN IN THAT COVERS THE GRAY
Go2INfZ8Mtk_5 0 AND YOU HAVE YOUR WIDE WHICH WAS COVERING IT BEFORE
Go2INfZ8Mtk_6 0 SO IF IT IS REALLY MOVED INTO GRAY COVERAGE AND REALLY TAKING THAT MARKET AND OVER
Go2INfZ8Mtk_7 0 BECAUSE IT WAS IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE BEFORE
Go2INfZ8Mtk_8 0 AND WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT OF A TO COVERAGE VERSUS LET'S SAY A CONSUMER AND GO INTO A STORM BUYING A BOX COLOR IS YOU REALLY GET A PERSONALIZED FORMULATION WHICH MEANS YOU

Go2INfZ8Mtk_10 0 COLOR WISE IT'S HEALTHIER
Go2INfZ8Mtk_11 0 IT IS NINETY SOME PERSON NATURALLY DRIED SO YOU'RE NOT HAVING ANY KIND OF PETROCHEMICALS IN THE IN THE HAIR COLOR ABSORB INTO YOUR SCALP AND
Go2INfZ8Mtk_12 0 ALSO WHAT'S REALLY GREAT IS THAT IF YOUR GRAY CHANGES BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT TENDS TO HAPPEN WITH INFORMANTS YOUR GRAY CHANGES IT COULD START AT LIKE A GREAT LIKE ALMOST LIKE A SLIGHT GRAY MOVE INTO MORE OF A WHITE OR YELLOW GREAT
Go2INfZ8Mtk_13 0 SO WITH THE WAY TO CURE TONES WE CAN USE IT THE ACTUAL TONE LIKE LET'S SAY THAT MOVES INTO MORE OF A YELLOW GREAT WE WOULD USE A VIOLET TONE TO KIND OF COUNTERACT THAT YELLOW AND MAKE IT MORE OF A NATURAL LOOKING A COLOR
Go2INfZ8Mtk_14 0 THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY GREAT ABOUT THE BIGGER COLOR VERSUS LET'S SAY A CONSUMER COLOR
Go2INfZ8Mtk_15 0 IF YOU IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY IF YOU'RE GOING TO IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE LET'S SAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOUR TEA CLEAN

Go2INfZ8Mtk_19 0 THEN WE ALSO HAVE THEM VOLUME WISE AND A TWENTY VOLUME BASICALLY IT GETS IN THE CHEMISTRY OF WHAT WE MIX WITH COLOR
Go2INfZ8Mtk_20 0 BUT EM WHAT THE TWENTY VOLUME DOES IS IT ALLOWS US TO OPEN THE CUTICLE UP TO THE FIRST FIFTEEN EXCUSE ME FOR THE FIRST FIFTEEN MINUTES TO DEPOSIT THE COLOR AND IT ALLOWS THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR THE LIFT PROCESS
Go2INfZ8Mtk_21 0 SO IT'S A REALLY GREAT COMBINATION OF COLOR TO USE A FOUR CONSUMER VERSES PURSE IS GOING TO THE STORE AND GETTING IT EVER COUNT

G4qh2s464gw_2 0 YOU'VE GOT THE CHANTER READ WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY LIKE AN OVAL READ IT IS A DOUBLE CANE READ AND IT FITS IN TO THE TOP OF THE CHANTER HERE
G4qh2s464gw_3 0 BY ITSELF IT MAKES THAT LOVELY NOISE IN THE CHANTER IT MAKES THIS MUCH LOUDER NOISE
G4qh2s464gw_4 0 YOU'RE READY FOR THIS
G4qh2s464gw_5 0 TO MY FACE CAN ALREADY
G4qh2s464gw_7 0 THE DRUM REEDS USED TO BE MADE OUT OF CANE AND THIS IS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE
G4qh2s464gw_8 0 THE SPLIT TIME HERE AND BY ITSELF IT SOUNDS LIKE A DUCK
G4qh2s464gw_9 0 THESE DAYS DRAWN REEDS ARE NOT MADE OUT OF CANE
G4qh2s464gw_10 0 THE MOST COMMONLY THEY'RE MADE OUT OF PLASTIC OR COMPOSITE MATERIALS
G4qh2s464gw_11 0 WHAT THIS DOES IS IT ALLOWS THE MAN MADE MANUFACTURED PRODUCT TO BE EXACTLY THE SAME SO YOU'VE GOT PRECISELY MATCHING DRAWN REEDS
G4qh2s464gw_12 0 THEY ALSO ARE MUCH EASIER TO KEEP IN TUNE AND THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO PROBLEMS FROM MOISTURE
G4qh2s464gw_13 0 THE PIECES OF THE PIPE OR FITTED TOGETHER WITH A JOINTS THAT ARE WRAPPED WITH JUST A WAXED STRING CALLED HEMP AND THAT WAY IT'S SORT OF KEEPS A TIGHT JOINT THERE
G4qh2s464gw_14 0 THE BAG ITSELF THESE DAYS A THEY HAVE A ZIPPER ON THEM SOME OF THEM WHICH ALLOWS ME TO OPEN IT UP AND GIVES ME EASY ACCESS TO A MOISTURE CONTROL SYSTEM IN HERE WHICH CAN IT CONTAINS THE BOX FULL OF A MOISTURE ABSORBING MATERIAL AND THE TUBE THAT CATCHES MOISTURE

gqe84LTCmiw_3 0 IT HOLDS IT IN THE PLACE KEEPS IT FIRM KEEPS IT TIGHT KEEPS THE STRING FOR MAKING THE TUNER BEND BACK AND FORTH
gqe84LTCmiw_4 0 NOW OFTEN TIMES YOU NEED TO DRILL A LITTLE BIT MORE OUT AROUND THE TUNER SO THAT YOU CAN FIT A TUNER COVER INTO PLACE
gqe84LTCmiw_5 0 NOW YOU DON'T WANT THE WHOLE TO BE TOO BIG SO YOU NEED TO FIND THE RIGHT DRILL PIECE
gqe84LTCmiw_6 0 YOU LINE IT UP BY JUST LOOKING MAKING SURE THAT IT'S NOT TOO BIG
gqe84LTCmiw_7 0 BECAUSE IF IT'S BIGGER THAN THAT HOLE AND IT'S REALLY JUST GOING TO BE LOOSE IT'S GOING TO FOLLOW
gqe84LTCmiw_8 0 BUT IF IT'S JUST ABOUT THE EXACT SAME SIZE A LITTLE BIT SMALLER IT'S GOING TO FIT REALLY SNUG IN THERE
gqe84LTCmiw_9 0 SO I'VE GONE AHEAD AND DRILL THE HOLES IN THIS GUITAR
gqe84LTCmiw_10 0 WE'RE READY TO ATTACH OUR TUNER COVERS THE GUITAR

gFq-hog96so_1 0 ALRIGHT SO THERE'S REAL
gFq-hog96so_2 0 ONLY TWO SAFETY CONCERNS WHEN YOU'RE CIRCUIT BENDING AND THE FIRST I'VE ALREADY MENTION WHICH IS YOU NEVER NEVER NEVER WANT TO CIRCUIT BEND SOMETHING THAT PLUGS INTO THE WALL UNLESS YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT ELECTRONICS AND YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW VOLTAGE AND THE RISKS AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SCENE DC AND YOU KNOW YOU KNOW ABOUT CAPACITORS AND WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO
gFq-hog96so_3 0 SO YOU KNOW CIRCUIT BENDING THINGS THAT ARE BATTERY POWERED LOW VOLTAGE IS VERY VERY SAFE
gFq-hog96so_4 0 JUST DON'T EVER DO ANYTHING THAT PLUG INTO A WALL UNTIL YOU REALLY FEEL IT YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT ELECTRONICS AND THAT YOU ARE KIND OF COMFORTABLE WITH GOING DOWN THAT ROAD BUT I PERSON WOULD DO IT
gFq-hog96so_5 0 WHEN YOU ARE CIRCUIT BENDING SOMETHING IT'S LOW VOLTAGE YOU WON'T GET A SHOCK OUT I DON'T KNOW MAYBE SOME THINGS THAT RUN OFF OF YOU KNOW A LOT OF BATTERIES AND MAYBE HAVE SOME BIG CAPACITORS AND THEN YOU MIGHT GET A LITTLE TANGLE OR SOMETHING BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN SHOCK BUY ANYTHING AND IT KIND OF MAKES SENSE BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT THE JUST RUN OFF SUCH LITTLE VOLTAGE OR JUST LITTLE LITTLE AA BATTERIES IN THEM AND SO
gFq-hog96so_6 0 AND MOST OF THEM DON'T HAVE A LARGE CAPACITORS IN THEM SO YOU KNOW YOU'RE REALLY NOT TO GET SHOCKS
gFq-hog96so_7 0 THE ONLY REAL RISK THAT THERE ISN'T WORKING WITH A CIRCUIT BOARDS FROM ELECTRONICS POINT OF VIEW IS YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT MAKE A BENDER TRY SOMETHING OUT THAT MIGHT FRY SOMETHING IN THE CIRCUIT BOARD LIKE YOU MIGHT FREYA CAPACITOR OR YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU KNOW IF YOU SEND LIKE A LOT OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE BOARD YOU KNOW TOO CLOSE TO THE POWER SOURCE OR TOO CLOSE TO YOUR CAPACITORS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
gFq-hog96so_8 0 SOMETIMES YOU CAN BAKE THAT CIRCUIT BOARD BUT YOU KNOW AT LEAST YOU CAME OUT OF IT AND SKINNY THE PREY
gFq-hog96so_9 0 SO SO THAT'S WHAT THOSE ARE REALLY THE ONLY RISKS FROM KIND OF THE ELECTRICAL POINT OF YOU BASICALLY NINE IF YOU'RE STAYING WITH BATTERY POWERED DEVICES
gFq-hog96so_10 0 AND THEN WE'RE NEXT GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE RISKS FROM THE SOLDERING IRON WHICH IS KIND OF AN IMPORTANT THING TO THINK ABOUT

hIIw2GHVA1o_1 0 ALRIGHT GOOD FATS BAD FAT IS WHAT'S THE SKINNY ON FATS
hIIw2GHVA1o_2 0 WELL OF IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN SOME PEOPLE MAY THINK BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT
hIIw2GHVA1o_3 0 YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME FATS THAT WE NEED JUST LIKE VITAMINS EVERYDAY
hIIw2GHVA1o_4 0 THOSE ARE CALLED ESSENTIAL FAST AND ONE IS WHEN AWAKE ACID
hIIw2GHVA1o_5 0 THE OTHER ONE IS CALLED LITTLE BANNICK ACID
hIIw2GHVA1o_6 0 WE KNOW LAKES BELONGS TO FAMILY CALLED WILL MAKE A SIX
hIIw2GHVA1o_7 0 NOBODY WANTS TO FAMILY CALLED WILL MAKE IT THREE A
hIIw2GHVA1o_8 0 MOST PEOPLE GET A PRETTY FAIR AMOUNT OF YOU MAKE IT
hIIw2GHVA1o_9 0 SIX IT'S YOU'LL MAKE A THREE THESE DAYS THAT NUTRITION IS OUR RECOMMENDING FOR GOOD HEART HEALTH
hIIw2GHVA1o_10 0 THAT'S ONE SEEMS TO BE LACKING IN THE DIET
hIIw2GHVA1o_11 0 SO WHAT I'M WHY DO WE NEED FATS
hIIw2GHVA1o_12 0 WELL WE NEED FATS FOR HORMONE PRODUCTION A IN THE BODY FAT IS CUSHION THE ORGANS THE BRAIN TO SIXTY PERCENT FACT IS PRIMARILY THE OMEGA THREE FAST SO WE NEED FOR GOOD HEART HEALTH
hIIw2GHVA1o_13 0 SOME PEOPLE FEEL THAT THE A THE PROBLEMS WE'RE HAVING THESE DAYS WITH HEART DISEASE AND ALTZHEIMER'S DISEASE HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE A OMEGA THREE IS THAT WE NEED SO AS A RESULT OF OUR BRAINS ARE LITERALLY DRYING OUT FROM THE OF TOO MUCH OF THE BAD FAT IS NOT ENOUGH OF THE GOOD OMEGA THREE FATS
hIIw2GHVA1o_14 0 INFLAMMATION IS OUT OF CONTROL OUR BLOOD IS TOO THICK
hIIw2GHVA1o_15 0 SO THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THESE GOOD FATS AND I WANT YOU TO GET SOME HEALTHY FATS WITH EACH MEAL
hIIw2GHVA1o_16 0 FATS COME FROM SEEDS AND KNOTS OF THOSE WOULD BE THE VEGETARIAN SOURCES GOOD OILS LIKE OLIVE OIL ALSO FATTY MEETS WHICH WE SHOULD TRYING HOLD DOWN THE DICE
hIIw2GHVA1o_17 0 THOSE HARD FATS YOUR WE MAKE CHOLESTEROL FROM THAT SO YOU WANT TO KEEP OUR CHOLESTEROL DOWN HERE AND WE NEED TO GO WITH THE A LOW FAT PROTEINS IN THE DIET LEAN PROTEIN AND EMPHASIZE THE LIQUID FAST THE ESSENTIAL FATS
hIIw2GHVA1o_18 0 THE ESSENTIAL FATS OF THAT WE CAN GET FROM SEEDS AND KNOTS IN FISH ARE WOULD BE GOOD SOURCES AND THE OLIVE OIL OF COURSE
hIIw2GHVA1o_19 0 ALL OF OIL IS PART PRIMARILY WHAT WE CALL ALL MAKE A NINE WHICH IS NOT AN ESSENTIAL FAST IT'S NEVER THE ESSENCE A HEALTHY FAST AND DOES THIS COULD EVEN BE USED FOR A LIGHT SAUTEING
hIIw2GHVA1o_20 0 OFF THE FLAX OUR OIL AS NOT TO BE USED FOR COOKING
hIIw2GHVA1o_21 0 YOU ADD IT TO YOUR FOODS THAT THE TABLE AND FLAX IS THE OMEGA THREE FAT
hIIw2GHVA1o_22 0 IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PARK HEALTH AND BRAIN HEALTH
hIIw2GHVA1o_23 0 YOU CAN EVEN GET TO THE EGGS THAT ARE OMEGA THREE ENRICHED AND WHAT THEY DO IS THEY FEED THE CHICKENS FLAXSEED WE'LL SEW THE EGGS OR HIGHER IN THOSE HEART HEALTHY OMEGA THREE FATS
hIIw2GHVA1o_24 0 IT'S OKAY TO USE SOME BUTTER IN YOUR COOKING A MODEST AMOUNTS OF BUTTER
hIIw2GHVA1o_25 0 IT'S ALL QUESTION OF BALANCE
hIIw2GHVA1o_26 0 EVEN COCONUT OIL WHICH IS A SATURATED FAT BUT IT IS A HEALTHY OIL HEALTHY FAT AND THIS HELPS US TO MAKE MORE OF THE HEALTHY CHOLESTEROL HD L'S
hIIw2GHVA1o_27 0 REMEMBER WE WANT A HIGHER PROPORTION OF THOSE HD ALL THE HEALTHY CHOLESTEROL
hIIw2GHVA1o_28 0 SO FROM THE BAD FATS WE NEED TO AVOID WE CAN'T REALLY RECOMMEND FRYING FOR HEALTH ALTHOUGH AS I SAY SOME WHITE SAUTEING ON OCCASION IS FINE
hIIw2GHVA1o_29 0 WE START WE WANT TO AVOID THE FATTY MEETS BACON SAUSAGE HAM THOSE TYPES OF THINGS CERTAINLY DEEP FRIED FOODS
hIIw2GHVA1o_30 0 AND AS I SAY YOU GET THAT LITTLE HEALTHY FATS WITH EACH MEAL
hIIw2GHVA1o_31 0 COULD BE SOME ALL OF THOSE ARE SOME OLIVE OIL A OR A FEW KNOTS HANDFUL OF KNOTS AND DOING LIKE THE METAL TRAINING IS TO INSTEAD OF PUTTING BUTTER ON YOUR BREAD HAVE LITTLE DISH OF OLIVE OIL WITH MAYBE SOME GARLIC AND HERBS IN THERE
hIIw2GHVA1o_32 0 DIP YOUR BREAD OR YOUR VEGETABLES IN THE OLIVE OIL
hIIw2GHVA1o_33 0 AND YOU SOME SALAD HEALTHY MAKE YOUR OWN SALAD DRESSING
hIIw2GHVA1o_34 0 THAT'S ANOTHER WAY TO GET FACTS WITH EACH MEAL

GV3LWLakDLk_6 0 SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS JUST SET UP ON WHATEVER LEDGE YOU WANT TO END UP POPPING OUT ON BY PUTTING YOUR FOOT ON THE TIP OF THE NOSE AND YOUR BACK FOOT SOMEWHERE BEHIND THE TRUCKS
GV3LWLakDLk_7 0 NOW IMAGINE THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABOUT WHEN YOUR SPEED RUNS OUT AND YOU'VE REACHED THE END OF YOUR NOSE BLUNT SLIDE
GV3LWLakDLk_8 0 SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS JUST PRACTICE POPPING OUT JUST REPEAT THE MOTION AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO TEST IT OUT
GV3LWLakDLk_9 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO PUT YOUR FOOT ON THE TIP OF THE NOSE AND POP IT OUT SO THAT IT CLEARS IT
GV3LWLakDLk_10 0 NOW THE MORE YOU TRY THIS THE MORE BETTER PREPARE YOU'LL BE WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF YOUR NOSE BLUNT SLIDE
GV3LWLakDLk_11 0 SO REMEMBER YOU CAN TEST IT ANYWAY THAT YOU WANT

Gbtwax_kED8_2 0 WELL FIRST OF ALL MUSCLE PAIN AND CRAMPING SPECIFICALLY CAN TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE OVERWORKING A MUSCLE
Gbtwax_kED8_3 0 ONE OF THE CONCEPTS OF PILATES IS PRECISE MOVEMENT INCORPORATING SPECIFIC MUSCLE CONTROL IN SPECIFIC WAYS SO THAT THE EFFICIENCY IN THE FLUIDITY OF YOUR MOVEMENT IS PRESENT DURING THE EXERCISES
Gbtwax_kED8_4 0 SO AS I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE ONE EXERCISE WHICH IS DONE FACE DOWN
Gbtwax_kED8_5 0 SO AS YOU LIVE FACE DOWN AND COME UP TO YOUR FOREARMS AND EXTEND YOUR LEGS AND INSTEAD OF POINTING YOUR TOES HARD AND POINTING FROM YOUR TOES BUT YOU MAY FIND THAT THAT PROMOTES MUSCLE CRAMPING
Gbtwax_kED8_6 0 SOFTEN SPREAD YOUR TOES AND PRESS THE TOPS OF YOUR FEET TO THE FLOOR
Gbtwax_kED8_7 0 INSTEAD OF KICKING YOUR HIP FROM YOUR HEEL YOU'LL ACTUALLY ENGAGE YOUR GLUTE AND YOUR HAMSTRING AT THE TOP OF THE HAMSTRING
Gbtwax_kED8_8 0 KEEP THE FOOT SAUCE
Gbtwax_kED8_9 0 SO NOTICE HOW I'M NOT HARD POINTING AT THE FOOT BUT THERE'S SOME SPREAD IN BETWEEN THE TOES
Gbtwax_kED8_10 0 SO ALL ENGAGE MY HAMSTRING AND GLUED TO CREATE THE ACTION INSTEAD OF ENGAGING THAT THE FOOT MUSCLES IN THE TOES AND I'LL DO THE SAME THING ON THE OTHER SIDE SOFTENING SPREAD THE TOES CREATE LENGTH THROUGH THE ANKLE AND THEN ENGAGE FROM THE GLUTE AND THE HAMSTRING
Gbtwax_kED8_11 0 SO YOU DO THAT A FEW TIMES
Gbtwax_kED8_12 0 THIS IS THIS IS ONE OF THE EXERCISES THAT WILL GET MOST PEOPLE IF YOU'RE WORKING THEIR FEET
Gbtwax_kED8_13 0 IN PILATES YOU WANT TO WORK FROM YOUR CORE AND IF YOU'RE WORKING TOO HARD FROM THE EXTERNAL PERIPHERAL MUSCLES YOU'LL FEEL THAT
Gbtwax_kED8_14 0 YOU'LL FEEL IT THROUGH CRAMPS
Gbtwax_kED8_15 0 WHEN YOU NOTICE THE CRAM TAKE A BREAK PAUSE SOFTEN THAT MUSCLE RECONNECT WITH YOUR CORE AND THAT SHOULD TAKE CARE OF IT
Gbtwax_kED8_16 0 SO THAT IS HOW YOU ELIMINATE MUSCLE CRAMPS OR MUSCLE PETITE THROUGH THE PRACTICE OF QUALITY

H347ELByMzk_3 0 OUR QUARTERBACK PRETTY MUCH RUNS JUST LIKE YOU WOULD A NORMAL HAND OFF PLAY EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT ONCE THE HANDS THE BALL OFF OUR QUARTERBACK THEN ALSO HAS TO TURN AND RUN TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FIELD SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN GO DOWN FIELD AND BECOME A BLOCKER AS WELL
H347ELByMzk_4 0 ONCE HE TAKES A SNAP FIRST OF ALL HE'S GOING TO TURN AND HE'S GOING TO DO WHAT WE CALL SEATING THE BALL
H347ELByMzk_5 0 HE'S JUST GOING TO SEE THE BALL RIGHT HERE IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE A FAKE TO THE FULLBACK
H347ELByMzk_6 0 THEN HE'S GOING TO STEP THROUGH AND HAND IT OFF TO THE TAILBACK
H347ELByMzk_7 0 SO A FAKE TO THE FIRST GUY THROUGH HANDS IT OFF TO THE SECOND GUY THROUGH
H347ELByMzk_8 0 NOW THE QUARTERBACK PIN IS GOING TO TURN AND RUN TO THIS SIDE OF THE FIELD AND HE'S GOING TO TRY TO LOOK TO HELP OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLAY

H-0T3I_6nC4_10 0 FOR YOU VEGETARIANS OUT THERE THIS IS A GREAT DISH FOR YOU
H1HAMTFXwqI_1 0 NEXT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT A PARTICULAR PROBLEMS THAT CAT HAS IN SOME WAYS THAT WE CAN ADJUST THIS KITTY CAT SIDE BEHAVIORS SO THAT THERE AREN'T PROBLEMS ABOVE THE HOME
H1HAMTFXwqI_2 0 AS FAR AS THE CATS ARE CONCERNED I HAVE IT TENDS TO BE DESTRUCTIVE AT THIS AGE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SHARPEN A CLOSET EVERYTHING
H1HAMTFXwqI_3 0 AND SO THERE'S SEVERAL APPROACHES THAT YOU CAN TAKE TO THAT
H1HAMTFXwqI_4 0 IS THIS CAT GOING TO BE AN INDOOR CAT
H1HAMTFXwqI_6 0 OKAY IT'S THIS A WHOLE OTHER TOPIC BUT THAT CATS THAT STAY INSIDE THE LIDS TWICE AS LONG AS CATS THAT ARE OUR OUTSIDE
H1HAMTFXwqI_7 0 CATS ROCKS I GET IT ALL KINDS OF TROUBLE WITH COYOTES AND DOGS IN CARS AND A LOT OF TRAUMA OUTSIDE
H1HAMTFXwqI_8 0 BUT CATS OF SAND SIDE GO GET A LOT OF DISEASES
H1HAMTFXwqI_9 0 THEY ALSO LOOK A LOT OF PROBLEMS SO I'M GOING TO LET YOU DECIDED TO DO THAT
H1HAMTFXwqI_10 0 SOMETIMES IT'S HARD WITH CATS THAT ARE INSIDE BECAUSE THERE CAN BE DESTRUCTIVE
H1HAMTFXwqI_11 0 AND SO I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO A FEW PRODUCTS THAT SOMETIMES REALLY CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT
H1HAMTFXwqI_12 0 A WENDY'S CAT START TO DO SOME CLAWING BEHAVIOR ON AN APPROPRIATE OBJECTS IN THE HOUSE ONE THING IS YOU CAN DO IS YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME PLACE WHERE THEY CAN BALL
H1HAMTFXwqI_13 0 AND SO IF YOU CATCH INCLINE WHERE THEY'RE NOT WANT AND YOU CAN EITHER TAKE SOME POINTS AND PUT THEM IN A CAN AND JUST SHAKE IT AND THE CAT WILL STOP DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING
H1HAMTFXwqI_14 0 SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO USE THIS WORKOUT AND SO WHAT YOU DO IS THAT THE CAT SHOULD LEARN THAT NO MEANS STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND CHECK IN WITH WHOEVER SET NOVEL
H1HAMTFXwqI_15 0 AND SO MY PHILOSOPHY IS FOR THE SCRATCHING BEHAVIOR IS THAT IT'S A REALLY REALLY GOOD IDEA TO TRAIN TRAINING CAT PROPERLY
H1HAMTFXwqI_16 0 AND SO IF YOU CAN TRAIN YOUR CAT OUT OF IT THAT'S THE BEST WAY
H1HAMTFXwqI_17 0 IF YOUR CAT IS ONE OF THOSE CATS IT'S JUST SO WILD AND YOU CANNOT CONVERT IMAGES RUINING YOUR HOUSE THERE'S SOME MAYBE ONE OR TWO PERCENT OF CATS WILL ACTUALLY RUIN YOUR HOUSE THAT I'M NOT AGAINST THE FLYING IF IT'S DONE RIGHT ON
H1HAMTFXwqI_18 0 YOU CLAWING IS REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT POORLY OF IN THE CAT WORLD BUT I THINK IT'S A LOT LESS TRAUMATIC TO LOOSER POSITIVES FROM OUTSIDE BECAUSE OR DESTRUCTIVE
H1HAMTFXwqI_19 0 SO IF IT GETS TO THE POINT WHERE YOU REALLY WANT TO STORE YOUR CAT OUTSIDE BECAUSE THE CORRECT IN YOUR HOUSE BUT RATHER HAVE A LOT AND KEEP THEM FROM RIGHT TO YOUR HOUSE AND SIDEWAYS
GnI9g-H3gLU_1 0 HI I'M THE STAR GODDESS AND HERE'S SOME KEYS FOR DATING A PISCES FEMALE

GnI9g-H3gLU_3 0 THEY'RE A GLAZE IS OR THEIR SYMBOL IS A FISH
GnI9g-H3gLU_4 0 TO FISH WITH THEIR TAILS TIED TOGETHER SWIMMING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
GnI9g-H3gLU_5 0 PISCES FACE A CONSTANT CONFLICT BETWEEN BUT THEY THINK THEY SHOULD DO WHAT THEY FEEL YOU SHOULD DO
GnI9g-H3gLU_6 0 AND THOSE ARE ALWAYS AT ODD SO THEY TRY TO GET BOTH OF THEIR NEEDS MINUTE AND END UP DOING NOTHING
GnI9g-H3gLU_7 0 THE HARDEST THING ABOUT GETTING A PISCES IS WHEN YOU SHOW UP MAKING SURE SHE'S NOT PRYING SHE'S NOT WE'D BE AND SHE'S READY TO ACTUALLY GO OUT OF THE HOUSE
GnI9g-H3gLU_8 0 PISCES ARE THEY WOULD LIKE TO HELP PEOPLE OUT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITIES IF YOU WANT TO DRAG ONE OUT OF THEIR HOUSE
GnI9g-H3gLU_9 0 MAKE SURE YOU TAKE THEM TO SOMETHING LIKE A CHARITY BENEFIT OR SOMETHING FOR HELPING JERRY'S KIDS BUT THE KEY TO GETTING A PISCES TO GO OUT ON A DATE AND TO HAVE A GOOD TIME IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS SOME REDEEMING SOCIAL VALUE INSIDE OF THE DATE
GnI9g-H3gLU_10 0 IF THAT FAILS AND THE BEST THING TO DO IS GRAB ABOUT THE LINE A LOAF OF BREAD A HANDFUL OF DRUGS AND FIND A NICE COUCH IN A DARK QUIET ROOM TO THE EDGE ON
GnI9g-H3gLU_11 0 SO THAT'S THE KEY TO DATING A PISCES THAT'S BETTER LIVING THROUGH ASTROLOGY

HbPQ89ZcC68_5 0 THEN IF I WANT TO CHANGE UP INTO A NOSE WHEELIE I'D SIMPLY RIDE DOWN SWITCH
HbPQ89ZcC68_6 0 DO THE SAME STEPS AND PUT ALL MY WEIGHT ON MY NOSE LIKE SO
HbPQ89ZcC68_7 0 AND THAT'S BASICALLY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NOSE WHEELIE AND A TAIL WHEELIE ON
HbPQ89ZcC68_8 0 IF YOU LEARN HOW TO DO IT BOTH WAYS THAT'S BETTER THAN IF YOU CAN ONLY DO ONE WAY
HbPQ89ZcC68_9 0 IT'S BETTER TO BE A STRONG RIDER BOTH DIRECTIONS ON A AVERAGE RIDER ONE DIRECTION
HbPQ89ZcC68_10 0 SAW IF YOU'RE I'M GOOFY FOOTED BUT IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE A REGULAR FOOTED IS THE SAME CONCEPT
HbPQ89ZcC68_11 0 NOW A WHEELIE ALL OF YOUR WAY WOULD BE FOCUSED ON YOUR RIGHT LEG LIKE SO
HbPQ89ZcC68_12 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOUR LEFT FOOT IS FORWARD
HbPQ89ZcC68_13 0 THAT IS A REGULAR TAIL BLOCK I MEAN TAIL WHEELIES
HbPQ89ZcC68_14 0 IF YOU WANT TO DO A NOSE WHEELIE JUST SWITCH IT UP AND PUT ALL OF YOUR WEIGHT OVER YOUR LEFT FOOT AND RAISE YOUR RIGHT
HbPQ89ZcC68_15 0 AND THAT WOULD BE A TAIL WHEELIE
HbPQ89ZcC68_16 0 THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE ON YOUR NOSE YOUR TAIL

G_q2GdcAglE_1 0 IN THIS VIDEO I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT A CLUB BALANCE
G_q2GdcAglE_2 0 NOW THIS IS A MEDIUM TO HARDEN CLUB TRICK
G_q2GdcAglE_3 0 REALLY YOU CAN INCORPORATE IT INTO A BALL PATTERN BUT YOU CAN BALANCE ANYTHING YOU WANT IT
G_q2GdcAglE_4 0 JUGGLERS DO IT AS LIKE TRADITIONALLY JUGGLERS WILL DO IT IN A PATTERN
G_q2GdcAglE_5 0 THE BALANCE OF JUGGLING CLUB ON THEIR CHIN
G_q2GdcAglE_6 0 A LOT JUGGLERS DEUCE GETS WHERE THE BALANCE LIKE A TABLE THE CHAIR LIKE A LADDER ON THE CHIN
G_q2GdcAglE_7 0 ALL THIS CRAZY STUFF
G_q2GdcAglE_8 0 REALLY BOUNCING SOMETHING ON YOUR CHIN DOES NOT TAKE AS LONG AS YOU MIGHT THINK
G_q2GdcAglE_9 0 TO LEARN HOW TO DO IT THE FIRST OFF I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT LOOKS LIKE
G_q2GdcAglE_10 0 THIS IS THE CHIN BALANCE
G_q2GdcAglE_11 0 YOU CAN SEE I'M CONSTANTLY ADJUSTING MYSELF SO THAT I KEEP THE CLUB BALANCE STRAIGHT ON MY FACE
G_q2GdcAglE_12 0 IT'S ALSO PRETTY COMMON TO DO ONE ON THE NOSE LIKE THAT OR THE FOREHEAD LIKE THAT
G_q2GdcAglE_13 0 NOW TO LEARN HOW TO DO THIS WE MIGHT WANT TO DO IS FIND SOMETHING LONGER THAN THE STANDARD JUGGLING CLUB
G_q2GdcAglE_14 0 THE LONGER IT IS THE SLOWER IT FALLS DOWN AND THE MORE TIME YOU HAVE TO RESPOND
G_q2GdcAglE_15 0 ANOTHER HELPFUL THING IS IF THERE'S MORE WEIGHT CONCENTRATE ON THE FAR AND
G_q2GdcAglE_16 0 A LOT OF PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO BALANCE WITH A BROOM
G_q2GdcAglE_17 0 LIKE A BROOM HAD ON THE FAR AND IT'S TALL IT'S HEAVY ON THE FAR IN
G_q2GdcAglE_18 0 WILL FALL DOWN REALLY SLOW
G_q2GdcAglE_19 0 SO YOU CAN JUST LIKE WE RUN OVER UNDERNEATH IT AND TAKE IT BACK UP
G_q2GdcAglE_20 0 A GOOD WAY TO LEARN HOW TO DO IT WITH BUT WITH A JUGGLING CLUBS SPECIFICALLY IS PUT A BEING BACK ON THE TOP OF THE CLUB
G_q2GdcAglE_21 0 THIS WILL DO IS THIS WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO FOCUS ON WE'RE LOOKING AT THE TIP OF THE CLUB WILL SLOW THE FALL DOWN A LITTLE BIT
G_q2GdcAglE_22 0 SO ONCE YOU DO IS PUT THE BALL ON THE TOP OF THE CLUB LOOK AT THAT BALL
G_q2GdcAglE_23 0 LOOK AT THE FUR THIS POINT YOU CAN POSSIBLY C AND TRY AND GET THAT BALANCE AS CLEAN AS YOU CAN
G_q2GdcAglE_24 0 THEN WE CAN WORK THIS INTO THE PATTERN AND DO SOME PRETTY AWESOME THINGS WITH IT
gBxfuKjRCc8_1 0 PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT AFFINITIES OF DIFFERENT GIBSON AND THAT'S REALLY BELAY THAT THIS IS MY GIFT AND IT'S WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BEGIN
gBxfuKjRCc8_2 0 I HAD THE UP AND THE JOB OUT THE CHIN AND THEY CAME ABOUT NINE YEARS AGO LOVER NINE YEARS OF THEM
gBxfuKjRCc8_3 0 JUST BEING RAISED IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND DID THAT THAT AGAIN I'M JUST DIDN'T AND IT WAS AN EVER AN OPTION THAT IT WAS A JOB
gBxfuKjRCc8_4 0 IT WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU DID AND SO THEN WHENEVER I WENT TO SCHOOL I GOT MY GRADIENT PHYSICAL THERAPY AND WAS DOING THAT WITH HUMANS AND BUT YET STILL YOU KNOW WORKING IN THE ANIMAL IN THE ANIMAL WORLD ANIMAL CARE WORLD VOLUNTEERING IN THE AND AND THAT'S HOW THIS INVOLVED
gBxfuKjRCc8_5 0 IF YOU KNOW JUST LEAD TO IT
gBxfuKjRCc8_6 0 NOW I DON'T REALLY RECALL EVER REALLY WANTING TO BE ANY BE ANYTHING IN THAT
gBxfuKjRCc8_7 0 INITIALLY MY GINA AND I WENT TO COLLEGE AT STEADY THAT CHAIN
gBxfuKjRCc8_8 0 I WAS AN THAT A LOT OF ACTING IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE AND EVEN AFTER COLLEGE IT SO I GUESS IT SOME POINT I WANTED TO BE AN ACTRESS
gBxfuKjRCc8_9 0 I WANTED TO BE A BALLERINA IF THAT I NEVER REALLY HAD BURNING PASSION BEING OUR NECK MAY THAT THIS WAS YET TINA AND I NEVER WAS REALLY PRESSED BY MY FAMILY TO SAY OH OKAY YOU HAVE TO BE THIS
gBxfuKjRCc8_10 0 I JUST KIND OF THINK AND I JUST KIND OF ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WHATEVER I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WOULD HAPPEN
GW_3gR4MCZg_1 0 ALRIGHT THE DRINK WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE IS CALLED A DJ'S BUBBLING BREW
GW_3gR4MCZg_2 0 FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS ADD SOME ICE TO A GLASS
GW_3gR4MCZg_3 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO DO A HALF A SHOT OF ONE FIFTY ONE
GW_3gR4MCZg_4 0 NOW THIS DRINK YOU WOULD USUALLY LIGHT ON FIRE
GW_3gR4MCZg_5 0 AND ONE FIFTY ONE IS GOING TO HELP THAT
GW_3gR4MCZg_6 0 UNFORTUNATELY I DO TO FIRE CODES IN THIS PARTICULAR BAR WE CANNOT DO THAT
GW_3gR4MCZg_7 0 SO NEXT THING WE'RE GOING TO ADD A SHOT OF A HALF A SHOT OF TEQUILA I KNOW YOUR UPSET BUT KEEP WATCHING
GW_3gR4MCZg_8 0 IT'S STILL GOING TO TASTE THE SAME
GW_3gR4MCZg_9 0 HALF A SHOT OF SOUTHERN COMFORT AND A HALF A SHOT OF PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS

GW_3gR4MCZg_13 0 THERE YOU GO STRAW AND ENJOY
hBBid5RhYJk_1 0 THE NEXT STEP IN HELPING YOUR PET COPE WITH ARTHRITIS AND THE SHOULDERS JUST ACTUALLY MASSAGE BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES RIGHT UP AND DOWN THROUGH THIS AREA
hBBid5RhYJk_2 0 AND THE REASON FOR THIS IS WHEN ONE LEG IS INJURED WHEN THERE'S ARTHRITIS AND ONE SHOULDER THE OTHER LEG CARRIES MOST OF THE WEIGHT DOES EXTRA WORK
hBBid5RhYJk_3 0 THE BODY TENDS TO GET OUT OF PHYSICAL BALANCE SO THE DOG WILL STAND SLIGHTLY CROOKED PUTTING THE WEIGHT ON ONE LEG RATHER THAN THE OTHER
hBBid5RhYJk_4 0 I'M MASSAGING THIS AREA IN BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES IT HELPS E SOME OF THE TENSION IS THE MUSCLES BECAUSE THE MUSCLES TIGHTEN UP TO COMPENSATE SO YOU WANT TO MASSAGE THROUGH THERE AND THAT WILL EASE THAT TENSION AND HELP THE TWO LEGS TO BE MORE BALANCE TO HELP THE DOG STAND MORE EVENLY
hBBid5RhYJk_5 0 AND THAT WILL PUT LESS PRESSURE ON THE GOOD LEG AND ALLOW THEM TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE
hBBid5RhYJk_6 0 SO THAT'S ONE OF YOUR MOST IMPORTANT MASSAGE POINTS WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE SHOULDER INJURY AND THIS HELPS KEEP THESE TWO SHOULDERS AT THE SAME HEIGHT
hBBid5RhYJk_7 0 WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN A DOG WHO HAS A PROBLEM IS ONE SHOULDER BONE WILL ACTUALLY SIT HIGHER THAN THE OTHER SO IF YOU FEEL IT YOU'LL FEEL ONE HIGHER THAN THE OTHER AND THAT'S ONE THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT

gGoFM4Q8n5E_2 0 AND I'VE ACTUALLY GOT SOME HERE TO SHOW YOU
gGoFM4Q8n5E_3 0 FIRST OF ALL THEY SHOULD BE LEATHER A SHOP TICKETS HOLE
gGoFM4Q8n5E_4 0 IF THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A HEEL THEY CAN BE FLAT BOOTS BUT USUALLY THEY'RE THE STYLE OF MOTORCYCLE GROUP
gGoFM4Q8n5E_5 0 SOMETIMES OR WITHOUT A STEEL TOE IN THE FRONT AND THE I DO ONCE AGAIN WITH THE CONTRAST WITH THE FASHION OF THE TIME IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES WHEN YOU KNOW PUNK WAS REALLY GETTING GOING WHICH ONE WOULD OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT

gGoFM4Q8n5E_13 0 LOW TOPS OR HIGH TOP DOESN'T MATTER
gGoFM4Q8n5E_14 0 IT WAS ACTUALLY FIRST POPULARIZED BY THE PUNCH MOVEMENT AND THESE ARE BECAUSE THESE WERE REALLY BASIC CHEAP SNEAKERS THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T WEAR INSTEAD
gGoFM4Q8n5E_15 0 EVEN EIGHTIES THAT WAS IT WAS A SORT OF THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR IN SNEAKERS IT ONCE AGAIN TO SHOW HOW INTO CONSUMERIST PUNKS WAR
hjzcMrlaP58_1 0 SO RATED KNIVES CAN BE SHARPENED
hjzcMrlaP58_2 0 MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO SHARPEN THESE CORRECTLY THE COMMON MISTAKE IS THEY'LL SHARPEN THE BACKSIDE WHICH WILL BRING OUR BURNER UP AND WE'LL MAKE IT SHARP TEMPORARILY WHICH ARE BASICALLY DOING IS GRINDING WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT YOU'RE GRINDING OFF THE SERRATIONS AND MAKING YOUR KNIFE INTO A STRAIGHT IS NOT
hjzcMrlaP58_3 0 THE CORRECT WAY TO SHARPEN A SERRATED KNIFE IS TO GET SOME KIND OF AROUND SHARPENING INSTRUMENT I SUGGEST CERAMIC
hjzcMrlaP58_4 0 SOME PEOPLE USE RAT TAIL FILES I SUGGEST CERAMIC AND WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS GO IN EACH LITTLE GROOVE SEPARATELY
hjzcMrlaP58_5 0 IF YOU'VE GOT A SHARP AND EACH LITTLE GROOVE
hjzcMrlaP58_6 0 AND AGAIN IT'S SAFE THIS TO PULL IT AWAY
hjzcMrlaP58_7 0 YOU CAN SHARPEN LIKE THIS BUT IT'S SAFE IS TO PULL IT AWAY FROM ME
hjzcMrlaP58_8 0 AND YOU JUST NEED IS TIME CONSUMING USING HAVE PATIENCE AND GO IN EACH LITTLE GROOVE SEPARATELY AND THEN ONCE YOU'VE GOT A BAR REP YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FEEL THE BURR ALONG THE BACK SIDE AND THEN JUST LIKE WITH A STRAIGHT EDGE KNIFE YOU GO BACK TO THE GOOD OLD LEATHER STROP
hjzcMrlaP58_9 0 YOU STROP THE BACK SIDE AND YOU STROP THE SERRATIONS
hjzcMrlaP58_10 0 AND REMEMBER WHICH YOU TO ONE SIDE YOU DO TO THE EDIT AND THIS LEATHER STROP WILL MAKE THIS SERRATED KNIFE WHERE IT WILL SAVE HAIR JUST LIKE A STRAIGHT EDGE
Gf_kQsJIQrY_1 0 I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO NEXT IS THE EYELINER
Gf_kQsJIQrY_2 0 THAT TYPE OF EYELINER THAT I PREFER IS THE ONE THAT COMES IN A LITTLE JAR LIKE THIS AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT WIDE AND IT'S MORE OF THAT TARIN ONE THAT YOU WANT
Gf_kQsJIQrY_3 0 AND YOU PUT IT ON WITH A BRUSH THAT SPECIAL FOR I LINING
Gf_kQsJIQrY_4 0 AND IT'S A VERY VERY SMALL AND VERY TIGHT AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE CONCEALER SLASH FOUNDATION BRUSH BUT IN A MUCH SMALLER FORM THE WITH THE BRISTLES ARE MADE
Gf_kQsJIQrY_5 0 AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET A GOOD AMOUNT ON THE TIP
Gf_kQsJIQrY_6 0 SOMETIMES I LIKE TO USE THE BACK OF MY HAND AS A PELLET TO GET IT ON THERE NICE AND SMOOTH BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT CLUMPING EITHER
Gf_kQsJIQrY_7 0 AND WHEN YOU PUT IT ON YOU WANT TO PUT IT AS CLOSE TO THE HAIRLINE THE EYELASH LINE AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY GET
Gf_kQsJIQrY_8 0 AND YOU WANT TO TRY TO GET IT IN A VERY THIN LINE YOU DON'T WANT IT TOO THICK
Gf_kQsJIQrY_9 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE IT VERY NATURAL LOOKING
Gf_kQsJIQrY_10 0 SO YOU WANT TO WORK YOUR WAY FROM WHATEVER AREA A YOU PREFER
Gf_kQsJIQrY_11 0 I LIKE TO START IN THE CENTER WITH MY WAY OUT
Gf_kQsJIQrY_12 0 AND THEN RIGHT AND WITH THAT IS I AND RIGHT WHERE THAT LAST EYELASH AND AT THE END OF MY
Gf_kQsJIQrY_13 0 I DO NOT LIKE TO GO OUT BECAUSE WHEN YOU PULL YOUR EYE LINER OUT IT ONLY EXTENDS THE IRON IT CLOSES IT
Gf_kQsJIQrY_14 0 WHEN YOU WANT TO MAKE YOUR EYES BIG AND MORE NOTICEABLE ON TV VERY IMPORTANT TO DO
Gf_kQsJIQrY_15 0 THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROCEDURES TO POP THOSE EYES OPEN

GkZV7uVZcIc_6 0 YOU CAN TELL THAT THEY'RE ADULT TEETH BECAUSE THEY'RE MUCH WIDER AND HEAVIER AND THICKER AND BABY PUPPY TEETH
GkZV7uVZcIc_7 0 PUPPY TEETER VERY NARROW AND SMALLER THESE ARE WIDER BUT I CAN SEE IN THE BACK HERE THAT THOSE MULLER'S ARE NOT COMPLETELY IN YET THEY'RE STILL COMING IN THERE STILL PULL PUSHING THROUGH
GkZV7uVZcIc_8 0 SO THE I DOT GETS ALL OF ITS TEETH ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS OF AGE SO THIS DOGS AND NOT ALL OF ITS TEETH ARE COMPLETELY IN IS JUST A LITTLE UNDER STEP AND MONTHS OF AGE OKAY SO WHEN THAT GIVES US A GOOD IDEA THAT IS WHAT THE AGE RANGES OF THIS DOG IS OKAY SO ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS OF AGE
GK_e19QGtoI_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING NOW ABOUT THE WARMING UP
GK_e19QGtoI_2 0 WHAT I MEAN THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT PILE OF TENNIS
GK_e19QGtoI_3 0 BESIDES THAT YOU NEED TO WARM UP YOUR BODY TENNIS IS A VERY HIGH IMPACT FOR IT TO THE POINT THAT IT'S CUT ON YOUR KNEES HIGH IN YOUR ELBOWS
GK_e19QGtoI_4 0 SO YOU STEP PULL ON YOUR SIDE IMPACTING YOUR MUSCLES IS GOING TO BE BAD FOR YOU
GK_e19QGtoI_5 0 YOU WANT TO STAY AS SLOW WARMING OF YOUR BODY WARM AND EVERYTHING UP TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW YOU DON'T RUNNING AN INJURIES
GK_e19QGtoI_6 0 ANOTHER ADVANTAGE OF WARMING THAT IS THAT THE CHEW ON A MENTAL MULTI THE TWO ON THE COMPETITION MENTAL GAME
GK_e19QGtoI_7 0 ALL RIGHT I'M GOING TO BE WORKING ON A TO WARM UP
GK_e19QGtoI_8 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE PLAYING I'M NOT TRY TO COME TO THE TIMING SCORE AND WARM UP THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE AT LEAST FIFTEEN MINUTES SO YOU HAVE GOOD TEN MINUTES TO WARM UP YOUR BODY BEFORE YOU START WITH THE MAT
GK_e19QGtoI_9 0 BECAUSE NORMALLY IN A TEN IS MUCH YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO HAVE FIVE MINUTES WARM UP
gNRVAI30QrA_1 0 HI THIS IS GARY ZYER FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
gNRVAI30QrA_2 0 LET'S NOT TAKE A LOOK AT THE ACTUAL PLAY THE GAME
gNRVAI30QrA_3 0 A NORMAL TURN CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS THE DRAW AND THE DISCARD
gNRVAI30QrA_4 0 THE PLAYER HAS TURN IT IS STARTS BY DRAWING OR TAKING ONE CARD FROM THE THE THE TOP OF THE STOCKPILE OR THE TOP CARD ON THE DISCARD PILE AND ADDING IT TO HIS HAND
gNRVAI30QrA_5 0 THE DISCARD PILE THIS FACE UP SO YOU SEE IN ADVANCE WHAT YOU'RE GETTING
gNRVAI30QrA_6 0 THE STOCK PILE IS FACE DOWN
gNRVAI30QrA_7 0 SO IF YOU CHOOSE TO DRAW FROM THE STOCKPILE YOU DON'T SEE THE CARD UNTIL AFTER YOU HAVE COMMITTED YOURSELF TO TAKE IT
gNRVAI30QrA_8 0 IF YOU DRAW FROM THE STOCK YOU ADD THE CARD TO YOUR HAND WITHOUT SHOWING IT TO THE OTHER PLAYERS
gNRVAI30QrA_9 0 IN THIS CASE WE'RE PLAYING WITH AN OPEN HAND
gNRVAI30QrA_10 0 TO COMPLETE YOUR TURN ONE CARD MUST BE DISCARDED FROM YOUR HAND AND PLACED ON TOP OF THE DISCARD PILE FACE UP
gNRVAI30QrA_11 0 IF YOU STARTED TERM BY TAKING THE TOP CARD OF THE DISCARD PILE THAT YOU MUST DISCARD A DIFFERENT CARD FROM YOUR HAND
gNRVAI30QrA_12 0 TAKING THE TOP THIS CARD AND PUTTING THE SAME CARD BACK IS NOT PERMITTED
gNRVAI30QrA_13 0 SO BE SURE THAT ONCE YOU TAKE THE CARD FROM THE DISCARD PILE BUT YOU REALLY DO NEED BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER TURN TO LAY IT BACK DOWN IN THE DISCARD PILE IF YOU DON'T
gNRVAI30QrA_14 0 IN MY CASE I DREW THE NINE OF SPACE FROM THE STOCK PILE
gNRVAI30QrA_15 0 NOW I'M HOLDING ELEVEN CARDS IN MY HAND
gNRVAI30QrA_16 0 I NEED TO GET RID OF ONE
gNRVAI30QrA_17 0 SO I CAN EITHER TAKE THE NINE OF SPADES THAT I JUST PICKED IF IT DOESN'T HELP MY HAND AT ALL AND I CAN TAKE THAT ONE AND PUT IT INTO THE DISCARD PILE
gNRVAI30QrA_18 0 OR IF I DECIDE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP IN MIND IN SPADES I WOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE ANOTHER CARD FOR MY HAND AND PLACE THAT CARD INTO THE DISCARD PILE
gNRVAI30QrA_19 0 BUT WE CAN ONLY BE HOLDING ONTO TEN CHORDS THAT ONE TIME
gNRVAI30QrA_20 0 SO THAT FINISHES THE SECOND PART OF THE TURN THE DISCARD
gNRVAI30QrA_21 0 AND NOW I'LL PLAY GOES OVER TO THE OPPONENT

GbkJk6a3eRE_8 0 AND YOU JUST WANT TO PUT THAT RIGHT DOWN INTO THE MIDDLE OF YOUR MIXTURE
GbkJk6a3eRE_9 0 AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MIX FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND TILL YOU SEE THAT IT'S A PRETTY WELL MIX MIXTURE

GtpJEzI7NeE_1 0 HOW MUCH DO CHARGE PEOPLE FOR YOUR TIME
GtpJEzI7NeE_2 0 IT'S REALLY EASY TO FIGURE SOMETHING LIKE THAT OUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A CD A TEE SHIRT THAT YOU MADE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A FIXED KOSS AND YOU KNOW YOU WORK ON IT AND YOU DESIGNED IT
GtpJEzI7NeE_3 0 YOU WOULD NORMALLY PIT DESIGNER FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT EASIER BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING WELL AND GENERALLY I WANT TO YOU KNOW DOUBLE THE PRICE OF OF MY COSTS RIGHT

GtpJEzI7NeE_12 0 SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD RIGHT
GtpJEzI7NeE_13 0 THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU'RE NOT ALWAYS GOING TO GET YOUR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE SHOW YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE A HUNDRED SHOWS OKAY AND THEN ALSO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE LOTS OF EXPENSES THAT COME IN THERE
GtpJEzI7NeE_14 0 IF YOU'RE ONLY BRINGING FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN YOUR EXPENSES A TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR SUDDENLY YOU'RE NOT MAKING FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO MAKE AN THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
GtpJEzI7NeE_15 0 SO YOU NEED TO THIS SIDE HEY WHAT IS IT WORTH WHAT DO I NEED TO MAKE

H764PyicDGo_1 0 IN THIS SERIES WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT SOME MORE ADVANCE CLUB JUGGLING TRICKS
H764PyicDGo_2 0 NOW CLUB JUGGLING TRICKS ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM BALL JUGGLING TRICKS
H764PyicDGo_3 0 AGAIN LIKE THREE BALLS THERE ARE A MILLION THREE CLUB TRICKS AND A MILLION VARIATIONS ON EACH INDIVIDUAL TRICK
H764PyicDGo_4 0 YOU DON'T NEED TO LEARN THE BALL AND YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE YOUR OWN SPIN ON EACH INDIVIDUAL TRICK
H764PyicDGo_5 0 YOU'RE DOING YOUR OWN WAY
H764PyicDGo_6 0 JUGGLING IS A VERY MALLEABLE PERFORMANCE AND SPORT ACTIVITY
H764PyicDGo_7 0 UM ONE THING YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE IF YOU DON'T GET DISCOURAGED WITH SOME OF THESE TRICKS
H764PyicDGo_8 0 SOME OF THEM WILL NOT WORK IT FIRST
H764PyicDGo_9 0 SOME OF THE WORK FOR MONTHS AND THEN IF YOU PRACTICE THEM ENOUGH THEY WILL WORK
H764PyicDGo_10 0 ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS PUT SOME TIME INTO IT PUT SOME EFFORT INTO IT AND LEARN HOW TO DO EACH INDIVIDUAL TRICK PART BY PART
H764PyicDGo_11 0 THINK ABOUT BREAKING IT DOWN
H764PyicDGo_12 0 THINK ABOUT THE TECHNIQUE OF YOUR THROWS AND MAKE SURE YOU KEEP YOUR POSTURE THE SAME
H764PyicDGo_13 0 SO YOU WANT TO HAVE SHOULDER WIDTH APART WITH YOUR FEET STRAIGHT BACK NOT ARMS AT NINETY DEGREES WANT TO KEEP EVERYTHING GOOD
H764PyicDGo_14 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO LET YOUR THROWS EVOLVED INTO BAD THROWS AND JUST PRACTICE EACH TRICK PART BY PART AND THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER
gCqmjWeqtY4_1 0 OKAY IN THIS NEXT CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE ACTUAL DOOR HANDLE AND HOW TO PROTECT THAT HOW TO MAKE SURE IT'S PAINTED CORRECTLY SO THAT THE DOOR LOOKS GOOD
gCqmjWeqtY4_2 0 BECAUSE THAT'S THE THE IN QUALITY
gCqmjWeqtY4_3 0 YOU REALLY WANT THIS DOOR LOOK GOOD AND THE DOOR HANDLE IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT GETS THE MOST USE
gCqmjWeqtY4_4 0 AND REALLY HAVE KIDS OR A BUNCH OF PEOPLE GOING IN AS A STORE IT'S GOING TO SEE IT'S ABUSE AND THE PAINT AROUND IT WILL SEE IT'S ABUSE
gCqmjWeqtY4_5 0 YOU CAN USE YOUR SCREWDRIVER AND ACTUALLY TAKE THE DOOR HANDLE OFF IF YOU KNOW HOW
gCqmjWeqtY4_6 0 IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW A DOOR HANDLE WORKS I DON'T RECOMMEND IT BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE THIS GREAT TAPE CALLED PAINTERS TAPE AND YOU SIMPLY WRAP IT AROUND THERE AND AND PROTECT THE HANDLE
gCqmjWeqtY4_7 0 NOW WHAT I DO RECOMMEND IS BECAUSE THIS IS A GARAGE THEY THIS HOMEOWNER HAS AN ACTUAL CHAIN LOCK ON THEIR DOOR
gCqmjWeqtY4_8 0 ONE OF THE DOOR TRIMS PAINTED IT WAS ACTUALLY TAKEN OFF
gCqmjWeqtY4_9 0 SO WHAT I DO SUGGEST IS THAT WITH THIS THERE'S FOUR SCREWS USE YOUR PHILLIPS HEAD SCREWDRIVER AND SIMPLY REMOVE THAT FROM THE DOOR
gCqmjWeqtY4_11 0 JUST MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FILL UP THE HOLES WITH THE PAINT
gCqmjWeqtY4_12 0 MIX YOU LEAVE THOSE HOLES THERE SO THAT IS EASY PUT BACK ONCE THE DOOR IS DRY
gCqmjWeqtY4_13 0 WE'LL JUST TAKE THIS OFF AND IT WILL BE READY TO START PRIMING
gCqmjWeqtY4_14 0 ANOTHER GOOD TIP FOR YOU IS ONCE YOU GET ALL THIS OFF AND YOU HAVE YOUR SCREWS IN YOUR HARDWARE IS GET YOUR LITTLE CUP AND STILL EVERYTHING IN THERE
gCqmjWeqtY4_15 0 THAT WAY YOU'RE SURE NOT TO LOSING THE HARDWARE GOES RIGHT BACK UP WHEN YOU'RE READY

g8bWKxCobxY_1 0 ALRIGHT NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO WITH YOUR VOICE
g8bWKxCobxY_2 0 THE FIRST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE VOICES THE CHARACTERS
g8bWKxCobxY_3 0 NOW YOUR PIECE MAY HAVE ONE OR TWO CHARACTERS THAT MAY HAVE FIFTEEN CHARACTERS
g8bWKxCobxY_4 0 DON'T FOCUS ON CREATING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT VOICE ISN'T ACCENTS FOR YOUR CHARACTERS
g8bWKxCobxY_5 0 THAT'S NOT NECESSARY
g8bWKxCobxY_6 0 WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR FIRST OF ALL IS SIMPLY VOLUME CAN WE HEAR YOU
g8bWKxCobxY_7 0 AND ARTICULATION CAN WE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
g8bWKxCobxY_8 0 BUT THEN WHAT ARE THE SADDLE DIFFERENCE IS THAT YOU CAN ASSIGNED TO EACH OF YOUR CHARACTER VOICES SO THAT WAY THE AUDIENCE CAN TELL THEM APART
g8bWKxCobxY_9 0 PERHAPS ONE OF THEM TALKS IN A LOWER VOICE MAYBE WHEN I'M TALKED A LITTLE FASTER
g8bWKxCobxY_10 0 DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT DEVELOPING THESE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT CHARACTERS BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THE NARRATION VOICE THAT'S GOING TO SAY SAID GYM SAID SALLY SAID ERNEST DEFIANTLY SO THAT THE AUDIENCE WILL ALWAYS KNOW WHO SET IT BECAUSE OF THE NARRATOR BUT IT HELPS TO HAVE SLIGHT DISTINCTIONS SLIGHT VOCAL CHANGES AMONG YOUR CHARACTERS
g8bWKxCobxY_11 0 NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NARRATOR
Gr-7Y16Eqm8_1 0 ALRIGHT SO HERE WE ARE WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR THE RESIN TO CURE

Gr-7Y16Eqm8_3 0 RESINS A FUNNY MATERIAL IT ALWAYS CURED FOREVER SO IT NEVER STOPS CURING
Gr-7Y16Eqm8_4 0 WHAT YOU'RE DOING REALLY WITH THE HOT COAT CEILING IN THAT THOSE THE YOU KNOW THOSE FUMES
Gr-7Y16Eqm8_5 0 SO REALLY OLD SURFBOARDS THEY GET BRITTLE UNTIE AND THE REASON WHY THEY GET BRIDLES BECAUSE THAT FIBERGLASS RESIN CONTINUES TO CURE
Gr-7Y16Eqm8_6 0 SO THIS IS ONE OF THE REAL GOOD CHANGES THAT'S OCCURRED IN THE AND THE FIBER GLASS AND RESIN FIELD ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT THE CLEANING A LOT OF THE PRODUCTS UP AND THEY'RE NOT THAT HARD POOL
g6IPyRwPX20_1 0 HI I'M JABARI PRIDE YOU BACK WITH EXPERT VILLAGE STUCK ON
g6IPyRwPX20_2 0 WE JUST DID PLOWS OUT NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH THE HURDLE STEPS
g6IPyRwPX20_3 0 OKAY PROCESS IS REALLY GOOD FOR HAMSTRINGS AND IF YOU DO IT ANOTHER VARIATION OF THAT'S GOOD YOUR LOWER BACK AS WELL
g6IPyRwPX20_4 0 SO THE FIRST YOU WANT TO DO IS WE'RE NINETY DEGREES NINETY NINETY NINETY NINE
g6IPyRwPX20_5 0 SO WHEN A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE AND YOUR ANKLE METHOD IS TO START STRETCHING OUR LEFT HAMSTRING
g6IPyRwPX20_6 0 YOU BRING YOUR RIGHT LEG BACK ONE ANOTHER NINETY DEGREE ANGLE RIGHT HERE IN YOUR A BETWEEN YOUR TWO THIGHS
g6IPyRwPX20_7 0 WANT TO COME BACK AND BRING IT ANOTHER THIRD NIGHT
g6IPyRwPX20_8 0 SO YOU HAVE YOUR ONE TO USE THE THIRD NINETY BANGLES IN THE OPPOSITE LEG AND YOUR FOURTH NINE IS GOING TO BE AS YOUR OTHER ANCHOR
g6IPyRwPX20_9 0 NOW IF YOU HAVE REALLY REALLY BAD FLEXIBILITY AND YOU CAN'T GET ALL FOUR NINETIES BUT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO BRING YOUR YOUR LEG THAT'S BACK
g6IPyRwPX20_10 0 BRING THAT ANKLE UP TOWARDS YOUR BUT THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME THE STRESS OF THE KNEE
g6IPyRwPX20_11 0 THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO ACTUALLY LEAN FORWARD AND REACH FOR YOUR TOE UP UNTIL IT'S FOR WITH YOUR HAND THAT'S WHAT'S ON THE SAME SIDE
g6IPyRwPX20_12 0 SO AS YOU'RE REACHING FORWARD YOU CAN FEEL THAT STRETCH IN YOUR HAMSTRING
g6IPyRwPX20_13 0 NOW WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS STRETCH YOU DON'T WANT TO BALANCE YOURSELF YOU KNOW FOR IT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS IT'S REALLY GOING UP YOUR CHANCES OF PULLING YOUR HAMSTRING AND YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT
g6IPyRwPX20_14 0 SO YOU JUST START UP STRAIGHT NICE AND TALL AND START REACHING
g6IPyRwPX20_15 0 IT'S A HURTS OR INTO ITS TO A LEVEL OF IN A COMFORTABLE THAT YOU CAN WITHSTAND
g6IPyRwPX20_16 0 ONCE YOU GET TO THAT POINT STOP HOLD FOR THIRTY SECONDS EASE OFF OF IT AND GO BACK AGAIN AND STRETCH UNTIL YOU KNOW YOU GET TO THAT POINT WE CAN WITHSTAND THE PAINT IS YOUR HANDS YOU'RE STRETCHING IT
g6IPyRwPX20_17 0 AND THAT'S A LITTLE STRETCH
h1rlwq9Itwc_1 0 THE MARINE ORGANISM WE'RE GOING TO IDENTIFY NOW IS THE CLEANING GO OFF
h1rlwq9Itwc_2 0 ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CLEANING FISH ONE WILL FIND ON A CORAL REEF IN THE CARIBBEAN IS THE CLEANING GOBI
h1rlwq9Itwc_3 0 BUT THE CLEANING THEY'LL BE HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED IN THE WATERS AROUND FLORIDA
h1rlwq9Itwc_4 0 IT'S A SMALL FISH ONLY ABOUT AN INCH TO AN INCH AND THREE QUARTERS IN LINE
h1rlwq9Itwc_5 0 IT IS A LONG CIGAR SHAPE
h1rlwq9Itwc_6 0 SO IT'S MAXIMUM GIRTH IS NO MORE THAN A QUARTER OF AN INCH IN MOST SPECIMENS
h1rlwq9Itwc_7 0 CLEANING GO THESE ARE HARD TO DIFFERENTIATE FROM A SIMILARLY COLORED AND SIMILARLY SIZED THE SHARP NOSE KOBY
h1rlwq9Itwc_8 0 BOTH FISH HAVE A BRIGHT YELLOW V ON THEIR NOSE ALTHOUGH THE SHARP NOSE CAN HAVE A WHITE TEA
h1rlwq9Itwc_9 0 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THAT THE CLEANING GO BEES YELLOW V FADES INTO A PALE STRIPE AS IT PROGRESSES TOWARD THE TAIL
h1rlwq9Itwc_10 0 WHEREAS THE SHARP NOSE HAS THE V CONTINUE TO THE TAIL EITHER AS A CONTINUATION OF THE YELLOW COLOR OR AS A BRIGHT BLUE STRIKE
h1rlwq9Itwc_11 0 THE SHARP NOSE KOBY WITH THE WHITE V ON ITS NOSE WILL HAVE THE WHITE COLOR CONTINUE AS A WHITE STRIPE TO THE TAIL
h1rlwq9Itwc_12 0 THE REST OF THE CLEANING THEY'LL BE IS BLACK OVER MOST OF THE BODY OF THE BELLY IS LIGHT COLORED WHITE OR WHITISH BLUE
h1rlwq9Itwc_13 0 CLEANING THOUGH THESE ARE USUALLY FOUND RESTING ON THE TOP OF CORAL HEADS AND USUALLY IN SMALL GROUP
h1rlwq9Itwc_14 0 THESE CONGREGATION'S OF CLEANING GO BREEZE FORM THE CLEANING STATIONS BETTER VISITED BY OTHER LARGER FISH
h1rlwq9Itwc_15 0 WHEN A LARGER FISH APPROACHES IT WILL HOVER OVER THE CLEANING STATION AND THE CLEANING GO THESE GO TO WORK BY WORKING OUR WAY ACROSS THE VISITORS BODY BEING THE ACTIVE PARASITES THAT ACCUMULATE ON THE BODY OF THESE DISHES
h1rlwq9Itwc_16 0 THESE ACTIVE PARASITES PROBABLY MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF THE CLEANING DOBIES DIET
h1rlwq9Itwc_17 0 ONE THING I LIKE TO DO WHEN I FIND ONE OF THE CLEANING GO BE CLEANING STATIONS IS TO SLOWLY EXTEND MY HAND TO THE AREA JUST ABOVE THE LIVING CORAL WHERE THE CLEAN GO BEES RESIDE AND HOLD IT STATIONARY FOR A MINUTE OR SO
h1rlwq9Itwc_18 0 MOST OF THE TIME THE CLEANING DOBIES WILL SWIM TO MY HAND AND START TO SWIM OVER IT CLEANING AWAY DEAD SKIN AND ANY OTHER THINGS THEY FIND THAT THEY THINK SHOULDN'T BE THERE
h1rlwq9Itwc_19 0 IT'S A FUNNY FEELING WHEN THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SO SMALL AND LIGHT IT KIND OF TICKLES AS THEY MOVE ACROSS YOUR HAND BETWEEN YOUR FINGERS AND STOP TO TARGET SOME LITTLE BIT OF LOOSE SKIN
h1rlwq9Itwc_20 0 CLEANING GUPPIES ARE MONOGAMOUS FISH MEANING THEY MADE WITH THE SAME FISH REGULARLY
h1rlwq9Itwc_21 0 EGGS ARE LAID ON THE SUBSTRATE USUALLY UNDER A LEDGE AND THE MALE GENERALLY GUARDS THE EGG MASS
h1rlwq9Itwc_22 0 EGGS HATCH IN A FEW DAYS AND THE FRY DRIFT WITH THE CURRENT AND TELL A OR A LARGE ENOUGH TO TAKE UP RESIDENCE ON THEIR OWN CORAL HEAD
h1rlwq9Itwc_23 0 I'VE SEEN SOME CLEANING STATIONS WITH SIX OR EIGHT CLEANING DOBIES ON IT OF VARIOUS SIZES AND OF OFTEN WANDERED IF IT WAS A FAMILY BUSINESS
h1rlwq9Itwc_24 0 I'LL NEVER KNOW FOR CERTAIN

gZQQqykotQE_7 0 ONE WAY IS IF YOU'VE GOT A QUARTERBACK LIKE THIS ONE THAT'S BIG AND STRONG AND CAN KEEP THIS GUY FROM GETTING IN THE PLAY THEN WE CAN PLAY BUMP AND RUN COVERAGE
gZQQqykotQE_8 0 IF YOU'VE GOT A UNDERSIZED CORNERBACK THEN YOU CAN'T USE BUMP AND RUN COVERAGE BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO GET ABUSE
gZQQqykotQE_9 0 SO THIS GUY'S GOT TO BE ABLE TO COME UP HE'S GOT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A GOOD CHECK AT THE INITIAL LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO IS TO PREVENT THIS GUY FROM GETTING INTO ANY KIND OF PATTERN
gZQQqykotQE_10 0 ALSO ONE THING THAT THIS WORKS GREAT WITH IS IN SHORT YARDAGE SITUATIONS
gZQQqykotQE_11 0 IT ALSO WORKS GOOD IF WE'VE GOT A LINEBACKER ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT IS BLITZING AND WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE GETTING TO THE QUARTERBACK QUICK
gZQQqykotQE_12 0 ALL WE WANT TO DO IS HOLD THIS GUY UP SO THE QUARTERBACK CAN'T MAKE A PASS
gZQQqykotQE_13 0 SO IT'S GOING TO LOOK A LITTLE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
gZQQqykotQE_15 0 HE'S GOING TO CHECK IN IS GOING TO STAY WITH THEM
gZQQqykotQE_16 0 AND REMEMBER ONCE YOU GET PASS FIVE YARDS YOU CAN NO LONGER MAKE CONTACT WITH THAT GUY YOU JUST GOT TO RUN WITH IT
gZQQqykotQE_17 0 BUT THE MAIN THING WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO KEEP HIM FROM GETTING OFF THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND A SLOW THE PLAY DOWN SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET TO THE OTHER TEAM'S QUARTERBACK

gZJmZ5Dxljw_2 0 WE JUST TO PUT ON YOUR OWN TOURNAMENT
gZJmZ5Dxljw_3 0 HI MY NAME IS DEAN HALE AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME INFORMATION TODAY ABOUT HOW TO PUT ON YOUR OWN SPADES TOURNAMENT
gZJmZ5Dxljw_4 0 SPACE HERMIT WOULD NORMALLY HAVE THIRTY TWO PLAYERS
gZJmZ5Dxljw_5 0 SO WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS HAVE REGISTRATION
gZJmZ5Dxljw_6 0 PICK A REGISTRATION FEET TEN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER PLAYER AND WHEN YOU COME IN YOUR GOING TO HAVE A TEAM CAPTAIN DRAW A NUMBER FROM ONE TO SIXTEEN OUT OF A HAT
gZJmZ5Dxljw_7 0 THAT WOULD BE THE TO THE TEAM THAT THEY'RE ON
gZJmZ5Dxljw_8 0 WHEN YOU HAVE THE TWO PLAYERS ON THE SAME TEAM USE ANOTHER TABLES
gZJmZ5Dxljw_9 0 YOU HAVE SIXTEEN TABLE SETUP AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS HAVE FOUR ROUNDS A PLAY THAT ARE IN CONSIST OF THIRTY MINUTE ROUNDS
gZJmZ5Dxljw_10 0 EACH ROUND YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY FOR TO A POINT TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY
gZJmZ5Dxljw_11 0 IF IN THIRTY MINUTES THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY POINT TOTAL HAS NOT BEEN REACHED THE TEAM WITH THE HIGH SCORE IS GOING TO WIND THAT ROUTE
gZJmZ5Dxljw_12 0 NOW WITH SIXTEEN TEAMS YOUR PLAY FOR ROUNDS SHOOTING A PLAY DOWN SO YOU HAVE THE FINAL TO TEAMS
gZJmZ5Dxljw_13 0 THE TEAM THE WINDS IN THE FINAL ROUND OF THE THIRTY MINUTES IS TO CLEAR THE CHAMPION
gZJmZ5Dxljw_14 0 THE BASIC RULES OF SPADES ARE GOING TO BE THE SAME AS ANY OTHER ANY OTHER SPADES GAME EXCEPT YOU'RE PLAYING WITH A TIME LIMIT ROUNDS AND YOU'RE PLAYING TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY POINTS PER ROUND WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN USUAL SO MAKE SURE YOU ADJUST YOUR GAME ACCORDINGLY AND KNOW THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE A HIGH POINT TOTAL VERY QUICKLY
gZJmZ5Dxljw_15 0 MY NAME IS DEAN HALE AND THAT'S THE BASICS OF PUTTING ON A SPACE TURN
G8oDEk3rixY_1 0 ALSO WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH AN OLDER GERIATRIC DOG YOU WANT TO WATCH INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YOUR OLDER DOGS AND YOUNG DOGS OR PUPPIES
G8oDEk3rixY_2 0 SO WE'VE GOT RAISE AND WHO IS JUST TO AN OLDER PUPPY
G8oDEk3rixY_3 0 SHE IS ABOUT A YEAR OLD SHE'S QUITE PLAYFUL STILL
G8oDEk3rixY_4 0 AND WE'VE GOT HANNAH WHO'S ABOUT TWELVE YOUR OLD RODDY AND IS NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN PLAYING
G8oDEk3rixY_5 0 IF SHE GETS NOT DOWN SHE COULD GET HURT BUT RAVEN MIGHT NOT ACTUALLY HAVE THE CENTS AT THIS AGE TO KNOW THAT SHE CAN'T PLAY WITH HANNAH THE WAY THAT SHE PLAYS WITH HER OTHER BUDDIES
G8oDEk3rixY_6 0 SO WHEN WE'VE GOT A YOUNGER DOG OR A PUPPY AND WE'VE GOT A GERIATRIC DOG WE NEED TO GIVE THE GERIATRIC DOG LOTS OF SPACE
G8oDEk3rixY_7 0 YOU NEED TO GIVE THEM A PLACE IN THE HOUSE WHERE THEY CAN GET AWAY FROM THE YOUNGER DOGS
G8oDEk3rixY_8 0 WE'RE DEALING WITH THE RAVEN HERE IS A LITTLE BIT OLDER PUPPY BUT IF WE HAD A VERY VERY SMALL PUPPY AND THEY HAVE EVEN LESS SENSE AND MORE PLAY YOU DRIVE IN MANY WAYS AND WE WOULD HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL OF GIVING OUR OLDER GERIATRIC DUG IS SAFE QUIET PLACED INTERACT WITH WHEN THEY'RE INSIDE AS WELL AS WHEN THEY'RE OUTSIDE
G8oDEk3rixY_9 0 NOT ONLY CAN THE GERIATRIC DOG GET HURT BUT THE PUPPY COULD ACTUALLY GET HURT AS WELL IF THE GERIATRIC DOG THE OLDER DOGS DECIDED THAT THEY HAD ENOUGH OF THE MESSING AROUND AND WAS GETTING HARASSED THEY COULD ACTUALLY TURN ON
G8oDEk3rixY_10 0 AND IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE IN THAT CASE BUT IT WOULD BE AN EXPERIENCE WOULD WANT THE PUPPY TO HAVE
G8oDEk3rixY_11 0 SO JUST BE AWARE THAT THE INNER ACTION BETWEEN A PUPPY AND AN OLDER DOG NEEDS TO BE MODERATED NEEDS TO BE MONITORED NOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE YOUNGER DOG IS NOT HARASSING FIELDER DOG
G8oDEk3rixY_12 0 ONE OF THE OLDER DOG HAS GOT A PLACE THAT THEY CAN RETREAT TO FOR SOME PIECING QUIET

GsuJmmXU5Qc_2 0 EVERY STATE REQUIRES DIFFERENT VACCINATIONS IS AND RABIES VACCINATIONS AT DIFFERENT INTERVALS AS SO CHECK WITH YOUR STATE AS FAR AS RABIES VACCINATIONS CONCERN
GsuJmmXU5Qc_3 0 VACCINATION IS PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT'S DOING IS BUILDING HIM YOU NEED TO BE A THE CATS BODIED TOWARD VIRAL INFECTIONS
GsuJmmXU5Qc_4 0 THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF VACCINATIONS THAT WE USE ESPECIALLY FOR OUTDOOR CATS
GsuJmmXU5Qc_5 0 THE FIRST ONE WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT IS RABIES VACCINATIONS AND RABIES VACCINATION IS TO PREVENT THE VIRAL INFECTION FROM RABIES THAT IS GENERALLY SEEN IN THE WILD CAP POPULATION AND A WILDLIFE POPULATION SUCH AS A DIRECTIONS AND SKUNKS BATS THINGS LIKE THAT
GsuJmmXU5Qc_6 0 RABIES VACCINATION DOES VARY FROM STATE TO STATE AS FAR AS FAR AS HOW OFTEN THEY HAVE TO RECEIVE THAT
GsuJmmXU5Qc_7 0 THESE VACCINATIONS ARE GIVEN UNDER THE SKIN GENERALLY ONCE A YEAR AND ARE VERY EFFECTIVE AT PREVENTING RABIES
GsuJmmXU5Qc_8 0 ANOTHER VACCINATION THAT WE GET TO CATS DEPENDING ON THEIR AGE AND IT'S GOING TO BE INDOOR OR OUTDOOR IS DISTEMPER WHICH IS A ESSENTIALLY AND EASY TERM OF UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS IN CATS

GsuJmmXU5Qc_15 0 THEY CAN CONTRACT IT HAD IT FOR A WHILE AND THEY CAN GIVE THIS TO OTHER CATS AND THEN EVENTUALLY THEY CAN SUCCUMB TO THE DISEASE
GsuJmmXU5Qc_16 0 RABIES VACCINATION IS TO PREVENT RABIES WHICH AGAIN IS SEEN A WILDLIFE POPULATION MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND THAT IS A FAIL DISEASE BUT IT CAN BE VERY VERY WELL PREVENTED
GsuJmmXU5Qc_17 0 ALL THESE VACCINES ARE GENERALLY DRAWN UP AND THEY'RE LIQUID FORM AND GIVEN UNDER THE SKIN ON DEPENDING ON HOW OFTEN THAT CAN BE OF ONCE A YEAR TO EVERY THREE YEARS
GsuJmmXU5Qc_18 0 ALSO WHEN THEY'RE KITTENS THEY HAVE TO BE BOOSTED GENERALLY ONE VACCINE FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER ONE TO THREE WEEKS LATER AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED BY A THIRD ONE DEPENDING ON WHICH VACCINES YEAST

Hai5VmQsXhU_2 0 AND NOW WE'RE TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CANVAS AND PRINTING ON CANVAS
Hai5VmQsXhU_3 0 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'LL RUN INTO WHEN YOU PRINT ON CANVAS IS THE PIECE THAT YOU RECEIVE WILL NOT BE A FINISHED PIECE ON LIKE PAPER THAT YOU PRETTY MUCH CAN PUTTING A LITTLE ON THE LOPE AND SELL
Hai5VmQsXhU_4 0 A CANVAS PIECE TYPICALLY IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE STRETCHED AND THAT'S ANOTHER STEP THAT'S INVOLVED AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE LATER
Hai5VmQsXhU_5 0 BUT WHAT IT INVOLVED BUT BASICALLY MEANS IS YOU TAKE A PIECE OF CANVAS LIKE THIS AND THROUGH A PROCESS THAT REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT OF WORK YOU END UP WITH A PRODUCT LIKE THIS WHERE IT'S TIP BASICALLY WHAT THAT WHAT SPIN HAPPENED IS THE CANVAS IS WRAPPED AROUND SOME PIECES OF WOOD STRETCHER BARS AND SECURED IN THE BACK
Hai5VmQsXhU_6 0 AND IT CAN BASICALLY IS READY TO HANG AT THAT POINT OR BE FRAMED
Hai5VmQsXhU_7 0 SO THAT'S WHAT STRETCHING MEANS AND AND IT'S A LITTLE INVOLVE IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT PROCESSING IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING YOU CAN DO YOURSELF OR YOU CAN PAY SOMEONE TO DO FOR YOU
Hai5VmQsXhU_8 0 SO THAT'S WHAT STRETCHING CANVAS MEANS
gRndDi4ebtA_1 0 HI MY NAME'S JILL WEISS AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO BUY A SOFTBALL BACK
gRndDi4ebtA_2 0 FIRST THING IS IS YOU WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU ARE MOST LIKELY GOING TO SPEND BETWEEN FIFTY DOLLARS AND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
gRndDi4ebtA_3 0 IT'S JUST KIND OF DEPENDS ON HOW SERIES YOU ARE
gRndDi4ebtA_4 0 YOU KNOW KIND OF ATHLETES OF YOUR YOUR CHILD OR IS IT GOING FOR
gRndDi4ebtA_5 0 MAIN THING IS IS A THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF A NO DIFFERENCE OF THE TYPES OF BATS
gRndDi4ebtA_6 0 YOU CAN DO THE MORE BOTTLED BOTTLE THAT IS WITH A KIND OF COLOR OR MORE OF AN UNLOADED BAGS OF
gRndDi4ebtA_7 0 AS FAR AS AN UNLOADED BET GOES YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF JUST EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS
gRndDi4ebtA_8 0 THE MOST OF THE POWER IS IN THE END OF THE BAT
gRndDi4ebtA_9 0 WHEN A BOTTLE BACK IT HAS A LARGER SWEET SPOT OF IN BUT IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T PRODUCES MUCH POWER AS AN ANIMAL THAT BET
gRndDi4ebtA_10 0 FOR YOUNGER ATHLETES FROM THE WAY TO TEST IT AS FAR AS SIZE GOES IN WEIGHT IS YOU WANT TO HAVE THEM HOLD IT WITH THEIR OUR BOTTOM THERE DOMINANT HAND OR MAYBE CHOKE UP ABOUT AN INCH A AND THEY IT AND THEN PULL IT OUT AND THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIRMLY GRIP IT AND HOLD IT WITHOUT YOU KNOW WITHOUT IT SHAKING
gRndDi4ebtA_11 0 IF IT'S TOO HEAVY FOR THE ATHLETE IN OTHER AND THEY CAN'T HOLD IT THEY CAN BOUNCE IT
gRndDi4ebtA_12 0 SO THAT'S ONE WAY TO BE ABLE TO TELL IF IF THE WAY TO THE BAT IS TOO HEAVY THEM OR YOU KNOW IF IT FITS
gRndDi4ebtA_13 0 AS FAR AS SIZE GOES IN YOU KNOW IT RANGES ANYWHERE FROM THE LENGTH BEING THE REALLY YOUNG TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT INCHES TO A COLOR TO THIRTY FOR
gRndDi4ebtA_14 0 I'M OBVIOUSLY TALLER AND TALLER GIRLS YOU USUALLY USE THE LONGER BATS
gRndDi4ebtA_15 0 PALMS FLAPPERS IF YOU'RE IN ON THE LEFT SIDE OR OR IF YOU'RE TRYING TO REACH THE OUTSIDE PITCH YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO USE AS A LONGER BAD THIRTY THREE INCH OR EVEN A THIRTY FOUR INCH
gRndDi4ebtA_16 0 THERE'S DIFFERENT BRANDS
gRndDi4ebtA_17 0 THE MAIN THING YOU WOULD WANT TO DO IS JUST ASKING COACHES ASKING DIFFERENT SOME YOU KNOW SALES REPS ON ON THE DIFFERENT BRANDS
gRndDi4ebtA_18 0 IT'S A SO THIS IS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO WANT ABOUT BUYING A BAT
gRndDi4ebtA_19 0 HI MY NAME IS JILL WEISS AND THAT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BUYING A BAT
gJaSUi21rrI_1 0 HI THIS IS JON AND IN THIS CLIP WE WILL BE INSTALLING THE CLOTHES IRS
gJaSUi21rrI_2 0 NOW FOR OUR TOP CLOSER WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO INSTALL ABOUT A QUARTER INCH IN FROM OUR DOOR FRAME
gJaSUi21rrI_3 0 NOW YOU WANT TO INSTALL YOUR DOOR BRACKET ABOUT ONE INCH DOWN FROM THE TOP OF YOUR DOOR
gJaSUi21rrI_4 0 THE NEXT THING YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS DRY FIT YOUR COMPONENTS IN PLACE FOR WHERE THEY SHOULD GO IN AND THEN MAKE A COUPLE MARKS WITH A MARKER TO TELL YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO DRILL FOR YOUR SCREWS
gJaSUi21rrI_5 0 ONCE YOU GET YOUR TOP CLOSER INSTALLED PROPERLY YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TEST IT AND START ON THE BOTTOM ONE
gJaSUi21rrI_6 0 NOW WHEN INSTALLING THE BOTTOM OF CLOSER IT WILL BE INSTALLED WITH THE SAME MEASUREMENTS AND IN THAT SAME PROCEDURES AS OUR TOP CLOSER
gJaSUi21rrI_7 0 AND LASTLY WE JUST AGAIN ONE TWO TEST OUR DOOR TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR HINGES ARE WORKING PROPERLY
gJaSUi21rrI_8 0 AND IT'S ALRIGHT IF IT DOESN'T FULLY CLOSE AT THIS POINT BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO ADJUST THE TENSIONING IN A LITTLE BIT
GPN8BxTQeBw_1 0 IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO DISCUSS X L ARE CABLES
GPN8BxTQeBw_2 0 XLR CABLES PRIMARILY ARE USED FOR MICROPHONES
GPN8BxTQeBw_3 0 BUT THEY COULD BE IMPORTANT AS THE GUITAR PLAYER IF YOU'RE PLAYING AN ACOUSTIC EGG AND YOU WOULD NEED TO AMPLIFIER GUITAR IF IT DIDN'T HAVE A PLUG ON IT
GPN8BxTQeBw_4 0 NOW IT LOOKS SIMILAR TO AN INSTRUMENT CABLE IN ITS CONSTRUCTION HOWEVER THE PLUGS ARE DIFFERENT
GPN8BxTQeBw_5 0 THE THING YOU'LL SEE HERE THERE'S THREE PRONG THIS ON ONE END
GPN8BxTQeBw_6 0 THIS WOULD BE THE MALE AND
GPN8BxTQeBw_7 0 AND THE FEMALE AND YOU'LL SEE THAT'S WHERE THERE'S HOLES INSTEAD OF PLUGS
GPN8BxTQeBw_8 0 NOW THIS CABLE DIFFERS FROM INSTRUMENT CABLE IN THAT IT DOES MATTER WHICH AND YOU USE
GPN8BxTQeBw_9 0 FOR EXAMPLE IF I TAKE A MICROPHONE HERE YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE MICROPHONE AS THE THREE PLUGS ON IT
GPN8BxTQeBw_10 0 YOU WOULD NEED TO USE THE FEMALE AND PLUG INTO THE MIKE AND THEN THE MALE AND WOULD GO INTO THE AMPLIFIER
GnbyKd0gugE_1 0 OKAY THIS DRILL IS THE SHORT GAME DRILL
GnbyKd0gugE_2 0 SO EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE THEORETICALLY IN FRONT OF THIS LINE SO WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO CHILLED EACH OTHER BOAT WE HAVE TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN THE FRONT COURT
GnbyKd0gugE_3 0 SO IT'S A WAY OF PRACTICING ALL THE DIFFERENT LITTLE SHORT BALL GETTING TO EVERYTHING I'M WATCHING WITH YOUR OPPONENT IS
GnbyKd0gugE_4 0 SO LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO IT
GnbyKd0gugE_5 0 SO WITH CHILDREN EACH OTHER
GnbyKd0gugE_6 0 IT'S A SO YOU SEE I HAVE IS TO KIND OF GOT THAT ONE BUT GARY GOT IN MY WAY
GnbyKd0gugE_7 0 SO WE'LL SO WE'LL SEE HOW WE CAN DO ON THIS ONE
GnbyKd0gugE_9 0 WORK THE DROP SHOT ANY COUNTER DROPS MADE AND I HAD THE ANGLE SHOT A BALL THAT'S A PRETTY TOUGH SHOT
GnbyKd0gugE_10 0 THAT'S THE A TRIPLE BALL SHOT ALL OF IT
GnbyKd0gugE_12 0 SO YOU CAN DO QUITE A WORKOUT DOING THIS DRILL IS THE FRONT COURT CAN GET PRETTY GOOD
GnbyKd0gugE_13 0 OLIVE OIL
GnbyKd0gugE_14 0 THE FRONT COURT ALL UP AND THEN THE STRAIGHT DROP
GnbyKd0gugE_15 0 SO THAT'S THE SHORT CHORD GAME
GnbyKd0gugE_16 0 OKAY GET A LOT OF GOOD PRACTICE WORKING ON IT OR TOUCH SHOTS AND HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH IT TOO
g_LPgfiX7Ik_1 0 OKAY FOLKS IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE A LIVING AS AN ARTIST
g_LPgfiX7Ik_2 0 I'M MIKE SOME PROFESSIONS THEIR LITERALLY DOESN'T DOZENS OF WAYS THAT YOU CAN MAKE A LIVING AS AN ARTIST
g_LPgfiX7Ik_3 0 IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO SKETCH DRAW PAINT DESIGN YOU HAVE MANY MANY OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU
g_LPgfiX7Ik_4 0 ONE AREA AND YOU COULD GO INTO THIS GRAPHIC DESIGN
g_LPgfiX7Ik_5 0 THESE DAYS A LOT OF THAT'S DONE A COMPUTER NOT AS MUCH THREE AND ANYMORE BUT USING COMPUTERS IS REALLY OPEN UP AN ARTIST WORLD AND NOT ALWAYS GIVE US GET ANOTHER TOOL WHICH TO CREATE A LOT OF PEOPLE LEAVE THAT DIRECTION
g_LPgfiX7Ik_6 0 IF YOU'RE MY LITTLE BIT MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY INCLINED TO NOT LIKE TO GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY QUITE AS MUCH THAT MIGHT BE REALLY GOOD OPTION FOR YOU
g_LPgfiX7Ik_7 0 IT'S A LOT OF CREATIVITY A LOT OF VERSATILITY AND THAT IS A WIDE VARIETY OF JOBS ARE DESIGNERS
g_LPgfiX7Ik_8 0 ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE A LIVING AS AN ARTIST WOULD BE TO BECOME A GRAPHIC NOVEL ARTISTS OR ANIMATOR MAYBE
g_LPgfiX7Ik_9 0 THESE ARE AND VERY VERY DIFFERENT FROM GRAPHIC DESIGN OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO HAVE A MUCH BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF A DIMENSIONS SHAPES IN TERMS OF THE HUMAN FORM AND THAT ALSO MOVEMENT THAT'S THE KEY IS WELL TO CREATE PANELS IN A COMIC STRIP OR ESPECIALLY TO CREATE ANIMATION AND TO BE AND DRAWN ANIMATOR WHICH IS KIND OF A RARE BREVE THESE DAYS BUT TO BE THE ONE YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN FORM HOW THE BODY MOVES AND BE ABLE TO DRAW WITHIN THOSE PARAMETERS
g_LPgfiX7Ik_10 0 THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY TO BE MADE IN THIS FIELD BECAUSE IT'S VERY THAT STARCH MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD AT THIS PARTICULAR SCALE SO IF YOU FIND YOURSELF REALLY PASSIONATE FEELING PASSION ABOUT DRAWING THESE TYPES OF A IMAGES THEN ABSOLUTELY GO FOR THAT BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO BUILD UP YOUR PORTFOLIO AND TO SUBMIT TO DIFFERENT EITHER AGENCIES OR ACTUAL PUBLISHERS OR ANYBODY ELSE'S THEMSELVES
g_LPgfiX7Ik_11 0 GET YOUR FOOT THE DOOR AND WORK YOUR WAY UP FROM THERE
g_LPgfiX7Ik_12 0 ANOTHER WAY AND IN MY MIND THIS WOULD BE JUST ABOUT EVERY ARTISTRY IS TO MOVE TO SOME PLACE LIKE YOUR YOUR PARROTS ITALY SOME EXOTIC OR LOCATION ANYWHERE LIKE THAT OPEN UP YOUR LITTLE ART GALLERY YOUR VERY OWN LITTLE ART GALLERY AND JUST PAINT
g_LPgfiX7Ik_13 0 DESIGN DRAW WHATEVER FROM YOUR OWN STUDIO AND THEN YOU KNOW HAVE PEOPLE WALKING UP THE STREET DEPRECIATE YOUR WORK HAVE IF YOU NOTICE PLATING GALLERIES ACROSS THE WORLD AND YOU KNOW THE GOOD LIFE BASICALLY
g_LPgfiX7Ik_14 0 NOW IF THIS IS YOUR GRIEVING ASPIRATION IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE THIS GET THE SKILL IN THE PASSION GO FOR I THINK THAT'S THE MOST MOBILE WAY IN MY MIND TO MAKE A LIVING AS AN ARTIST
g_LPgfiX7Ik_15 0 TO DO IT LITERALLY ON YOUR OWN LIVING OFF YOUR WORK YOU KNOW YOUR OWN BOSS YOU MAKE YOUR OWN HOURS EARLY DOESN'T GET MUCH BETTER THAN THAT
g_LPgfiX7Ik_16 0 IF YOU BECOME A SUCCESS AT IT THAN THIS GUY'S ON IT
g_LPgfiX7Ik_17 0 YOU OFFICIALLY ARRIVED
g_LPgfiX7Ik_18 0 AND THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE WAYS TO MAKE A LIVING AS AN ARTIST
gFWvrtf209A_1 0 SO LIKE I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE BACK AND BODY WORKS IN THE BODY CREAM IN THE LOTION THIS IS THE BODY SPRAY
gFWvrtf209A_2 0 THIS IS ALSO PARA BLOSSOM BECAUSE IT'S MY FAVORITE FLAVOR AND THIS IS SO GREAT BECAUSE THIS I TAKE EVERYWHERE WITH ME
gFWvrtf209A_3 0 SO NOT ONLY CAN YOU SPRAY YOUR BODY IT YOU CAN SPRAY THE ROOM YOU CAN SPRAY YOUR CAR YOU CAN SPRAY ANYTHING YOU WANT
gFWvrtf209A_4 0 THIS ALSO COMES IN A LITTLE TRAVELS SIZE SO YOU CAN PUT IN YOUR PURSE
gFWvrtf209A_5 0 NOW IF YOU DON'T CARRY PERFUME ON YOU WHICH I RECOMMEND TO CARRY LITTLE TUBE IN YOUR PURSE YOU CAN ALWAYS CARRY A LITTLE BODY SPLASH BECAUSE IT'S A VERY NATURAL SCENT
gFWvrtf209A_6 0 SO WHEN YOU GOING INTO A MEETING OR YOU'RE GOING INTO YOUR OFFICE YOU CAN ALWAYS SPRITZ YOURSELF REALLY CLIP REALLY QUICKLY WITH THE BODY SPRAY
gFWvrtf209A_7 0 SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE CREAMS AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE PERSON YOU GET THE BODY SPLASH
gFWvrtf209A_8 0 THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE THING I RECOMMEND AS FAR AS PRODUCTS ON THE GO FOR THE WOMAN THAT'S VERY BUSY AND ONLY HAS TIME FOR ONE SPRAY
gFWvrtf209A_9 0 IT'S SO THIS IS A GREAT FRESHEN UP
gFWvrtf209A_10 0 OKAY WHEN YOU GO INTO THE BACK THERE MY HOTELS YOU ALWAYS SEE THOSE LITTLE SPRAYS AND YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO USE SOMEBODY ELSE A SPRAY
gFWvrtf209A_11 0 SO ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A LITTLE TRAVEL SIZE OF THE PAIR BLOSSOM
gFWvrtf209A_12 0 NOW THE GREAT THING ABOUT BATH AND BODY WORKS IS THAT COME AND THREES SO YOU CAN GET AS MANY FLAVORS IS YOU WANT AND SMELL AS MANY SENDS AS YOU WANT UNTIL YOU FIND THE SCENT THAT GOOD FOR YOU
gxk4ThdlwB0_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO HAVE YOUR DOG WEIGHT OUT RATHER THEN COME TO YOU
gxk4ThdlwB0_2 0 SOMETIMES WHEN YOU HAVE A DOG ESPECIALLY A NEW ONE IN YOUR FAMILY HE MAY ASSOCIATE HAT COMING TO YOU AS SOMETHING BAD HAPPENING TOO LONG AND WHO HAS AND USE THAT WHEN THEY ARE MAD AT THEIR DOG OR THEY'RE TRYING TO PUNISH THEM
gxk4ThdlwB0_3 0 SO WHAT WE MAY HAVE TO DO TO START THAT IS TEACH DOG JUST SIT IN WAIT UNTIL YOU GET TO THEM
gxk4ThdlwB0_4 0 SO IT'S GOING TO START WITH YOUR BASIC SIT AND THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR DOG WILL LEARN TO SIT AT A DISTANCE SO THIS IS SOME AFTER YOU'VE PRACTICED THAT
gxk4ThdlwB0_5 0 FIRST THING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TEACH THE DOG AGAIN IS YOUR SIT
gxk4ThdlwB0_6 0 YOU'RE GOING TO DO YOUR DISTANCE IT SO THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE FURTHER AWAY SIT THE DOG WILL STAY AND SIT WHEREVER HE IS
gxk4ThdlwB0_7 0 THEN YOU CAN COME TO THE DOG AND SAFELY GET THE DOG AND REWARD HIM
gxk4ThdlwB0_8 0 AND THE TRICK TO THIS WOULD BE TO LET THEM GO OFF AND PLAY AGAIN AFTERWARDS
gxk4ThdlwB0_9 0 IF YOU'RE ALWAYS HOOKING THEM UP TAKE HIM OFF TO LEAVE FOR THE DAY YOU'RE SIMPLY TEACHING A DOG THAT IS NOT WORTH IT TO COME TO YOU ARE TO WAIT FOR YOU
gxk4ThdlwB0_10 0 SO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR TREATING AM FOR THOSE BEHAVIORS
gHik_54lD7s_1 0 HELLO I'M SIFU MALLON WITH THE CLEARWATER KUNG FU CENTER
gHik_54lD7s_2 0 THIS IS MY ASSISTANT MELISSA AND THIS IS KUNG FU FOR HEALTH
gHik_54lD7s_3 0 THE FOOTWORK THAT WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH IS CALLED OUR FIGHTING STANCE
gHik_54lD7s_4 0 THIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF ALL THE DIFFERENT FOOTWORK EXERCISES THAT YOU'LL SEE
gHik_54lD7s_5 0 TO START WITH YOUR FEET
gHik_54lD7s_6 0 OKAY YOU CAN PLACE BOTH YOUR FEET TOGETHER
gHik_54lD7s_7 0 YOU'RE GOING TO TURN YOUR RIGHT FOOT OUT FORTY FIVE DEGREES
gHik_54lD7s_8 0 YOU'RE GOING TO STEP FORWARD WITH YOUR LEFT FOOT ABOUT THE WIDTH OF YOUR SHOULDERS ARE OUTSIDE WITH OF YOUR SHOULDERS
gHik_54lD7s_9 0 OKAY NOW YOU'LL NOTICE THAT BOTH FEET ARE POINTING IN THE SAME GENERAL DIRECTION
gHik_54lD7s_10 0 SO IF I TAKE TWO LINES POINTING FOR MY TOES DOUBLE FOLLOW UP WITH THIS WAY
gHik_54lD7s_11 0 A LOT OF TIMES YOU'LL SEE PEOPLE MAKE THE MISTAKE AND GO INTO THE POSITION WITH THE REAR FOOT TURN BACK OR THE REAR FOOT TURN THIS WAY
gHik_54lD7s_12 0 THIS DOESN'T GIVE YOU A VERY IMMOBILE STANCE
gHik_54lD7s_13 0 SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH FEET ARE TURNED INTO THE SAME DIRECTION
gHik_54lD7s_14 0 WE ALSO WANT TO PLACE THE WEIGHT ON THE BALLS OF YOUR FEET
gHik_54lD7s_15 0 YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO GO LIFTING YOUR HEELS UP LIKE THIS BUT YOU WANT TO FEEL THE PRESSURE OKAY ON THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT
gHik_54lD7s_16 0 THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS TO ROCK BACK AND FORTH SO THAT YOU CAN FEEL YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY IS
gHik_54lD7s_17 0 OKAY AND YOU FEEL THE PRESSURE ON THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT
gHik_54lD7s_18 0 THE HANDS ARE IN WHAT'S CALLED A SPLIT GUARD POSITION
gHik_54lD7s_19 0 THIS IS GOING TO TAKE OUR LEFT HAND OKAY AND LIFTED UP THIS WAY
gHik_54lD7s_20 0 SHE'S GOING TO BRING HER RIGHT HAND CROSSING THE LOWER BODY THIS WAY
gHik_54lD7s_21 0 HER SHOULDERS STAY RELAXED
gHik_54lD7s_22 0 THE UPPER ARM WILL BE USE MAINLY FOR BLOCKING HEIGHT TECHNIQUES
gHik_54lD7s_23 0 THE LOW ARM WILL BE MAINLY BLOCKING FOR LOWER TECHNIQUES
gHik_54lD7s_24 0 FOR STRONG VERY STRONG BODY TECHNIQUES BOTH HANDS WOULD COME TOGETHER
gHik_54lD7s_25 0 THIS IS CALLED OUR FIGHTING STANCE
gHik_54lD7s_26 0 I'LL PERFORM IT ON A STRAIGHT ANGLE SO YOU CAN SEE FROM A FORWARD POSITION HERE
gHik_54lD7s_27 0 OKAY AND THEN YOU REPEAT THE SAME THING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
gHik_54lD7s_28 0 THIS IS FIGHTING STANCE KUNG FU FOR HEALTH

Ha-QrxCjDk0_1 0 OKAY WHAT I'VE GOT SO FAR AS ELEVEN COLUMNS AROUND

Ha-QrxCjDk0_11 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO BE BONE OUT TOO MUCH

HguhKS5ke_s_3 0 AND THESE THAT I USE TO DESIGN DETAIL TO MAKE THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE APPEALING BUT THEY ARE BASICALLY FROM OF MELODY AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH FUNCTIONALITY FUNCTIONALITY IS NECESSARY
HguhKS5ke_s_4 0 YOU CAN'T ALWAYS BE THE ALL OF OUR DESIGNER BECAUSE EVEN THEN IF YOU'RE ALWAYS THAT PERSON WHO DOES THINGS A LITTLE BIT OFF THAT LITTLE BIT OFF IS GOING TO BECOME MUNDANE AFTER A WHILE
HguhKS5ke_s_5 0 IT'S GOING TO CROSS OVER TO THAT LEVEL WHERE ALL YOUR CRAZY STUFF SEES IS TO BE CRAZY
HguhKS5ke_s_6 0 IT'S EXPECTED AND IT WHO LIKES TO DO THE EXPECTED
HguhKS5ke_s_7 0 IF YOU'RE ALWAYS DO SOMETHING CRAZY WHACK THAT WEIRD PEOPLE ARE GOING TO EXPECT THAT SO YOU KNOW WHAT ONE SEASON HIT HIM WITH FUNCTIONALITY
HguhKS5ke_s_8 0 DO SOMETHING COMPLETELY BASIC START IN FUNCTIONAL
HguhKS5ke_s_9 0 THESE ARE BORE SHORTS

h8ZC9z944cU_1 0 THE CUTTERS THROWN WITH TWO SEAMS
h8ZC9z944cU_2 0 IT'S MUCH THE SAME AS A TWO SEAMED FASTBALL
h8ZC9z944cU_3 0 THE CUTTER IS ACCOMPLISHED BY EITHER CUTTING THE BALL TO THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT
h8ZC9z944cU_4 0 IF YOU WANT TO CUT THE BALL TO THE RIGHT IN YOUR RIGHT HAND A PITCHER YOU WE CUT THE BALL IN HALF AND POSITION BOTH FINGERS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BALL
h8ZC9z944cU_5 0 IF YOU WANT TO CUT THE BALL TO THE LEFT AND A CUTTER FASTBALL POSITION FINGERS ON THE LEFT HALF A BALL TO CREATE SPIN AND MOVEMENT THAT WOULD MAKE THE BALL BASICALLY CURVE TO THE RIGHT

HIK53Hm2DpI_4 0 IF YOU HAVE ALL HIGH CARDS YOU CAN BE EXCLUDED FROM THE LOW SO HAVING ALL HIGH AND ALL OF A LOW IT'S KIND OF A WATCH
HIK53Hm2DpI_5 0 HERE WE'VE GOT THREES INDUCES AND THREES INDUCES SUITED DOUBLE SUITED
HIK53Hm2DpI_6 0 EITHER WAY IT'S A HAND WORST SEEING THE FLOP WITH YOU KNOW USUALLY IN OMAHA HIGH LOW YOU WANT TO GO TO THE FLOP WITH AN ACE IN YOUR HAND AN ACE IN A TWO OR AN ACE AND A THREE OR FOUR TO FIVE
HIK53Hm2DpI_7 0 BUT IF YOU GO WITH THE REASON TO USE IF AN ACE COMES ON THE BOARD YOU ARE ACTUALLY IN THE DRIVER SEED TO TAKE THE NUT LOW

Gl5UYe25Bmg_5 0 THERE ARE CONSISTENT OF PLASTIC THAT SOME OF THE GUM COLOR
Gl5UYe25Bmg_6 0 AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE TEETH BETTER IN THEM
Gl5UYe25Bmg_7 0 THE LITTLE SCALLOPS OR THE AREAS THAT FOOD REST AGAINST THE TASTE OF FOR SUPPORT
Gl5UYe25Bmg_8 0 YOU HAVE A MORE TRADITIONAL PARTIAL DID SURE THAT IT HAS A METAL FRAME WORK
Gl5UYe25Bmg_9 0 AND HAS HARMS THAT HOLD A PARTIAL IN PLACE
Gl5UYe25Bmg_10 0 NOW WITH LITTLE REST SEATS AND THEN THE REPLACEMENT TEETH
Gl5UYe25Bmg_11 0 I WORK THERE AREN'T REPLACEMENT TEETH ON BOTH SIDES
Gl5UYe25Bmg_12 0 I OFTEN I'M OF PLASTIC SKIRT AROUND THE THE DENTURE
Gl5UYe25Bmg_13 0 YOU ALSO HAVE THE OPTION OF HAVING A ON A PARTIAL THAT'S IMPLANTS SUPPORTING
Gl5UYe25Bmg_14 0 THE THE SUPPORT FOR THE PARTIAL WOULD BE IN THE BONE IN

Gl5UYe25Bmg_17 0 AND THAT WOULD SNAP THEM
HbQDnZ3-X3I_1 0 ANOTHER PASS THAT YOU WANT TO KEEPING YOUR WEAPON TWICE AS THE OVERHEAD PASS
HbQDnZ3-X3I_2 0 THE OVERHEAD PASS IS EFFECTIVE DURING THE GAME WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF SPACE BETWEEN YOU AND THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PASS IT TO AND YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO GET IN THERE WITH SOME ZIP SO THAT THE DEFENSE DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO GET IN BETWEEN AND TRY TO STEAL THE BALL
HbQDnZ3-X3I_3 0 THE OPEN IMPORTANT THING WITH THE OVERHEAD PASS IS YOU WANT TO IT IT'S EXACTLY LIKE THE PASS IS CALLED YOU WANT TO COME OVER THE HEAD
HbQDnZ3-X3I_4 0 SO YOU COME OVER THE HEAD AND WHEN YOU PASS IT JUST AS ANY OTHER PASS YOU WANT TO STEP INTO THE PASS
HbQDnZ3-X3I_5 0 SO WHEN YOU COME TO YOU WANT TO COME OVER THE HEAD COME DOWN STEP INTO THE PASS AND YOU SEE HOW MY HANDS ARE FACING MY ME
HbQDnZ3-X3I_6 0 SO WHEN YOU YOUR PASS THAT YOUR HANDS NEED TO FACE YOUR MAIN WHEN YOU'RE COMPLETE WITH A PASS
HbQDnZ3-X3I_7 0 THAT'S CALLED FOLLOW THROUGH
HbQDnZ3-X3I_8 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE CATCHING ALSO JUST LIKE THE OTHER PASSES YOU WANT TO STEP INTO YOUR CATCH
HbQDnZ3-X3I_9 0 SO IT CATCHES IT AND IMMEDIATELY IF I SEE ANOTHER MINUTE I WANT TO PASS IT TO I HIT HIM WITH THE OVERHEAD PASS STEPPING INTO THE THROW
HbQDnZ3-X3I_10 0 JUST SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU CAN KEEP KIND OF KEEPING YOUR REPERTOIRE WHENEVER YOU'RE LOOKING AT AN AD AND LOOKING AT A MAN THAT IT'S QUITE A DISTANCE FROM YOU AND YOU WANT TO PASS IT TO A WITHOUT THE DEFENSE COMING IN TO TRY TO STEAL
HbQDnZ3-X3I_11 0 SO KEEP THAT IN MIND WHENEVER YOU'RE PLAYING BALL THE OVERHEAD PASS IS REALLY EFFECTIVE
gDXMhFMxEhc_1 0 AS YOU'RE LEARNING HOW TO SPIN POI IT MIGHT NOT BE OBVIOUS THAT FIRST BUT THE AWARENESS OF THE UPSWING AND THE DOWN SWING OF THE POI ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN MANIPULATING THAN THAT TO MOVE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
gDXMhFMxEhc_2 0 IF YOU'RE HAVING A HARD TIME TURNING JUST THINK ABOUT EXAGGERATING THE DOWN SWING IN THE UPSWING UNTIL YOU GET AND INTUITIVE FEEL FOR IT
gDXMhFMxEhc_3 0 SO IF I'M GOING TO BE TURNING WITH MY POI SPINNING FORWARD DOWN AND THEN WITH THEM SPINNING BACKWARDS UP
gDXMhFMxEhc_4 0 IT'S ACTUALLY HELPFUL TO HAVE YOUR WHOLE BODY GET INTO THE DOWN AND UP TO GET THE FEELING OF WHEN THE TIMING IS FOR THE POI TO MOVE
gDXMhFMxEhc_6 0 LET YOUR BODY LEAD YOU AS YOU FEEL THE WEIGHT GOING DOWN AND UP AND EVENTUALLY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TURN THE FULL CIRCLE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS
gDXMhFMxEhc_7 0 ALL YOU MAY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT A LOT AT FIRST AFTER SOME PRACTICE IT WILL JUST BECOME NATURAL

G63nAhglHSw_3 0 THIS IS CALLED A MARK GAIL COLLAR AND THIS ONE HAS A CHAIN ON IT SO THAT THE DOG MAY REACT TO THE SOUND
G63nAhglHSw_4 0 BUT ONLY CLOSEST TO A CERTAIN DEGREE WITHOUT GETTING ANY TIGHTER ON THE DOG
G63nAhglHSw_5 0 ALSO WORKS VERY WELL WITH ANY TYPE OF DOG LIKE COLLYER GREYHOUND WHERE THE HU MATE SLIDE BACKWARDS AND CAN GET OUT OF THEIR COLOR BECAUSE IT WILL TIGHTEN AND YOU COME UP ON BECOME ON TIGHTER ON THE DOG OR THEY CAN ESCAPE
G63nAhglHSw_6 0 SO THIS IS GOOD FOR THAT TYPE SITUATION
G63nAhglHSw_7 0 IF YOU HAVE A PINCHER COLLAR AND THIS MAY LOOK MEDIEVAL BUT IT CAN BE A GOOD TOOL FOR YOUR DOG IF YOU FIND WITH THIS YOU'RE DOING LOTS AND LOTS OF CORRECTIONS
G63nAhglHSw_8 0 IF THAT'S THE CASE YOU MAY NEED TO GO TO A MORE WHAT WE CALL A VERSA TYPE COLLAR WHICH IS THIS
G63nAhglHSw_9 0 THESE COLORS ALONE DON'T TRAIN YOUR DOG YOU SHOULD RECEIVE INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTION FROM A TRAINER IN YOUR AREA TO ENSURE THAT YOU USE IN IT CORRECTLY
G63nAhglHSw_10 0 COUNT HOW MANY TIMES YOU'RE GIVEN CORRECTIONS TO YOUR DOG AND THAT MAY INDICATE THAT CHANGE AND TOOLS

h8Zj6qHmTj8_3 0 IT'S NOT SO MUCH OF FUN OF CRAZY WHILE GAME AS IT IS REALLY AGAIN ABOUT CONNECTION PACING AND GROUP MINE
h8Zj6qHmTj8_4 0 SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU GET EVERYBODY IN THE GROUP IN THE CIRCLE KIND OF CLOSE LIKE SHOULDER TO SHOULDER
h8Zj6qHmTj8_5 0 AND THEN I HAVE EVERYBODY KIND OF SOFTEN THEIR EYES FOCUSED
h8Zj6qHmTj8_6 0 MAYBE THEY WANT TO CLOSE THEIR EYES MAYBE THERE'S GOING TO LOOK DOWN PEOPLE CHOOSE A THIS ONE HAVE A SOFT FOCUS ON THEIR EYES

h8Zj6qHmTj8_8 0 AND I'M GOING TO SEE HOW HIGH THEY CAN COUNT ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SOMEONE AND SO FORTH SEE WHAT NUMBER THEY CAN REACH AS A GROUP
h8Zj6qHmTj8_9 0 NOW THE RULES ARE NO ONE PERSON CAN SAY TWO NUMBERS IN A ROW
h8Zj6qHmTj8_10 0 SO IF I SAY ONE SOMEONE ELSE IN THE GROUP HAS TO SAY TO
h8Zj6qHmTj8_11 0 ALSO YOU CAN'T OF CREATE ANY PATTERN SO WE CAN JUST GO ROUND CIRCLE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
h8Zj6qHmTj8_12 0 IT HAS TO BE ORGANIC ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX IT HAS TO BE DIFFERENT PEOPLE KNOW NO SPECIFIC PATTERN
h8Zj6qHmTj8_13 0 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS NO TWO PEOPLE CAN TALK AT THE SAME TIME
h8Zj6qHmTj8_14 0 IF TWO PEOPLE TALK OF THE SAME TIME STAY THE SAME NUMBER THE SAME TIME EVEN START TO SAY THE SAME NUMBER THE SAME TIME YOU BEGIN BACK AT ONE
h8Zj6qHmTj8_15 0 SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT THAT GROOVE MIND OF KNOWING WHAT IS THAT YOUR TURN TO GO AND REALLY FEELING THAT INSTINCT AND GOING ON IT AND KNOWING WHEN IT'S TIME TO HANG BACK AND THE OTHER PEOPLE PARTICIPATE

h8Zj6qHmTj8_20 0 IT'S A GOOD MEASURE KIND OF HOW IN SYNC YOUR GROUP IS HOW HIGH YOU CAN GET WITH THIS GAME
h8Zj6qHmTj8_21 0 NOW THIS GAME CAN BE A LITTLE FRUSTRATING AT TIMES I WANT TO WARN YOU ABOUT THAT
h8Zj6qHmTj8_22 0 IF YOU CENTS A GROUP GETTING FRUSTRATED OR A WERE UPSET ARE TIRED TAKE THE TIME OUT
h8Zj6qHmTj8_23 0 LET THEM IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO D BRIEF AND SEE WHAT'S COMING UP WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE GROUP WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE MAKE IT A DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE GROUPS GOING TO MESS UP A LOT ON STAGE AND WE NEED TO PRACTICE HOW TO DEAL WITH

GpkmlwtEoTk_4 0 HERE'S TO A IMAGES THAT WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT
GpkmlwtEoTk_5 0 ON BOTH OF THEM YOU'LL NOTICE THE BACKGROUND HAS BEEN SOFTENED BY USING KLEENEX TO DAB THE WAX WHEN I WAS ON THE PANCAKE GRETEL
GpkmlwtEoTk_6 0 NOW ON ONE OF THESE ON THE RIGHT IT IS DRAWN ON A LOT WITH THE WAX DIRECTLY IN BLOCK FORM ON THE PAPER ITSELF
GpkmlwtEoTk_7 0 ON THE OTHER PAINTING A LOT OF THAT WHAT I CALL IRISES THOSE FLOWERS WE'RE DONE WITH THE IRON INSTEAD OF A HAT THAT I TOOK OFF THE GRILL AND THEN IT WORKED WITH AN IRON TO CREATE THOSE FLOWERS
GpkmlwtEoTk_8 0 BUT LET'S JUST TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THAT WAX BEHAVES ON THE GRILL
GpkmlwtEoTk_9 0 AND THE PAPER IS HOT ON A GRETEL ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TOUCH THAT WAX BLOCK YOU SEE IN YOU CAN DIRECTLY TO PAINT WITH THE WAX
GpkmlwtEoTk_10 0 AND AGAIN AS I SAID ON SOME OF THOSE PAINTINGS WE WE SOFTEN THE BACKGROUND BY DABBING WITH KLEENEX
GpkmlwtEoTk_11 0 I'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO GET EFFECTS BY TAKING SOME OF THE WAX PUTTING IT RIGHT ON THE GRID ALL OVER HERE
GpkmlwtEoTk_12 0 MAY BE STICKING SOMETHING LIKE AN OLD RUBBER ERASER IN LIKE THAT AND USING THAT TO DRAW WITH
GpkmlwtEoTk_13 0 ANOTHER THING THAT YOU CAN USE ARE THESE SOFT THAT THEY'RE SOLD IN CRAFT STORES TO ACTUALLY MAKE RUBBER STAMPS OUT AND BUY HEATING A METAL OBJECT AND PUSHING IT ON THERE UNTIL IT FORMS A IMAGE
GpkmlwtEoTk_14 0 BUT I'VE USED IN A AGAIN PUTTING SOME WAX LET'S SAY ON THE GRETEL DABBING THAT IN THAT CREATING PATTERNS LIKE THAT

GFttwLutLSY_3 0 AND WHAT IT HAS IS IT HAS A CONDENSER MOTOR IN THE BASE OF THE REFRIGERATOR AND BE IN THE BACK HERE
GFttwLutLSY_4 0 AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT TAKES A REFRIGERANT AND IT CIRCULATES IT OVER THROUGH SOME EVAPORATOR CALLS SO THAT THE HEAT IS RELEASED AND AS THE HEAT IS RELEASED IT GETS THE REFRIGERANT GETS VERY COLD IS AND YOU'LL HAVE A FAN SO YOU'LL HEAR YOUR REFRIGERATOR AND ACTUALLY YOU HIT RUNNING AND THERE'S TWO THING TO DO
GFttwLutLSY_5 0 THERE'S A FAN THAT STRONG SOME AREA AND THEN THERE'S ALSO COMPRESSOR THAT TAKING THAT REFRIGERANT AND AS IT GOES THROUGH THE SYSTEM IS COMPRESSING IT BACK SO THAT AS IT COMES BACK IN EXPANDS AGAIN IT RELEASES ITS HEAT BECOMES VERY COLD AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SURF RIGHT THROUGH THE REFRIGERATOR AND MAKE THE REFRIGERATOR COLD
GFttwLutLSY_6 0 AND THAT AIR CIRCULATES FROM THE FRONT HERE IT CIRCULATES THROUGH AN OUT THE BACK AND THEN INSIDE THE REFRIGERATOR AND PARTICULAR TO THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF A ELECTRONIC CONTROLS WE CAN ACTUALLY SET THE EXACT TEMPERATURES AND BAND AS THE AIR BLOWS OVER THE COILS AND GETS VERY COLD THEN IS BLOWN INTO THE REFRIGERATOR BOX AND KEEPS ACTUALLY COLD AIR CIRCULATING HERE TO WHATEVER TEMPERATURE YOU NEED FOR YOUR REFRIGERATOR OR FOR YOUR FREEZER
GFttwLutLSY_7 0 SO I'M TIM GIPSON AND THAT'S HOW REFRIGERATOR WORKS

h2zYAVKm5zM_7 0 YOU CAN PUT IT IN A PEAT PEARL LIKE TYPE COMBINATION
h2zYAVKm5zM_8 0 REMEMBER THAT DEAL LIKES A GOOD AMOUNT OF LIGHT
h2zYAVKm5zM_9 0 SO DON'T PUT IT IN A SHADY A SPOT OF YOUR YARD OR GARDENING
h2zYAVKm5zM_10 0 ALSO MAKE SURE IT HAS A GOOD SOURCE OF WATER

g6DYg1m3XQs_2 0 MANY INSTRUCTORS WILL SAY INHALE NOT YOUR HEAD AND EVERYONE IN THE CLASS CARS
g6DYg1m3XQs_3 0 AND WHAT'S HAPPENING WHEN YOU LOWER YOUR HEAD IN THIS WAY IS THAT YOU'RE LENGTHENING THE MUSCLES IN YOUR NECK RATHER THAN AND TEACHING YOUR HEAD HAVE FALL FORWARD RATHER THAN A INCREASING THE LENGTHEN YOUR SPINE

g6DYg1m3XQs_8 0 SO YOUR CHIN DOES COME DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND KIND OF DOUBLES HERE

Gtm13n0R0O4_1 0 WHEN THEY ARE IN THE BATH TUB OR YOU'RE TAKING ABOUT THEIR COUPLE THINGS TO CONSIDER
Gtm13n0R0O4_2 0 FIRST OF ALL IS WATER TEMPERATURE
Gtm13n0R0O4_3 0 THE HOT OR THE WATER THE MORE LIKE THERE'S GOING TO BE A REACTION WITH YOUR ECZEMA
Gtm13n0R0O4_4 0 IT CAN CAUSE VERY BAD ITCHINESS ON YOUR SKIN RIGHT IN YOUR SKIN
Gtm13n0R0O4_5 0 THE HE GETS CHECKING YOUR BODY FROM THE HOT WATER AND IT CAN SPARK A FLARE OUT
Gtm13n0R0O4_6 0 SO WHAT YOU YOUR BEST BET IS TO USE THE LUKE WARM BATH AND THAT'S STAYING IN IT TOO LONG
Gtm13n0R0O4_7 0 DOCTORS RECOMMEND FIVE TO TEN MINUTES FOR BATH
Gtm13n0R0O4_8 0 WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH CLEANSE THE SKIN ESPECIALLY IF YOU DO HAVE AN ECZEMA FLARE UP YOU DON'T WANT TO USE ANYTHING TOO ROUGH AGAINST THE SKIN
Gtm13n0R0O4_9 0 SO USING A WASH CLOTH IS NOT A GOOD IDEA
Gtm13n0R0O4_10 0 INSTEAD OF JUST PUT THE CRUMBS ARE ON YOUR HAND AND USE THAT TYPE OF YOUR BODY IN ORDER TO CLEANSE YOURSELF
Gtm13n0R0O4_11 0 THAT WAY YOU WON'T HAVE ANY REACTION OR ANY KIND OF ABRASION ON THE SKIN BECAUSE WHAT THE ECZEMA DOES ONCE YOU START SCRATCHING IT YOU'RE CREATING LITTLE ABRASIONS IN YOUR SKIN SCRATCHES THAT MAKE YOUR SKIN EVEN CHEER WHICH MAKES YOU WANT TO SCRATCH IT MORE
Gtm13n0R0O4_12 0 WHEN YOU HAVE A STRETCHES AND YOU KEEP ITCHING IT IT WON'T HEEL IN IT USUALLY WILL LEAD TO SOME KIND OF A SECTION

hI-IRsEQw7E_4 0 THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY COME ALL THE WAY OUT
hI-IRsEQw7E_5 0 THE NICE THING ABOUT THIS ONE IS ALREADY HAS THE SEAM BINDING AROUND IT TO KEEP THE RAW EDGES FROM FRAME
hI-IRsEQw7E_6 0 AND WHAT I USUALLY DO IS I START ON THE INSIDE SAME OF THE PANT LEG SO IT DOESN'T SHOW THAT MUCH
hI-IRsEQw7E_7 0 I AM GOING TO USE A CONTRASTING THREAD JUST SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT I'M DOING HERE
hI-IRsEQw7E_8 0 AND I NEVER START MY SEWING WITH THAT NOT I ALWAYS START IT WITH THE THREE LITTLE LOOPS
hI-IRsEQw7E_9 0 AND I DO IT ON THE PART THAT'S NOT GOING TO SHOW ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PANTS
hI-IRsEQw7E_10 0 SO I JUST DO THREE LITTLE LOOPS
hI-IRsEQw7E_11 0 FIRST AND YOU JUST TAKE A FEW LITTLE FRIENDS THAT AND YOU CAN LEAVE A LITTLE BIT HANGING OUT THE END BECAUSE YOU'LL EVENTUALLY CUT THOSE OFF ANYWAY
hI-IRsEQw7E_12 0 AND THEN THE SECOND IF YOU DON'T BRING IT RIGHT THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST IF YOU CAN JUST TO KIND OF CLOSE BY
hI-IRsEQw7E_13 0 OTHERWISE IT WILL PULL YOUR THREAD ALL THE WAY OUT AGAIN
hI-IRsEQw7E_14 0 YOU WANT TO PULL TOP BUT NOT SO TIGHT THAT IT'S GOING TO PULL YOUR THREAD THROUGH

hI-IRsEQw7E_19 0 JUST A FEW LITTLE THREADS AND THEN GO UNDERNEATH THE EDGE OF THAT SEAM BINDING ON THE TURNED UP EDGE
hI-IRsEQw7E_20 0 AND THEN JUST CATCH A FEW LITTLE THREADS KIND OF NEAR THAT ON THE PANTS

hI-IRsEQw7E_25 0 AND YOU CAN DO THIS AS CLOSE AS YOU WANT DEPENDING ON THE FABRIC
hI-IRsEQw7E_26 0 SOME FABRIC WON'T MOVE SHIFT SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO IT CLOSER
hI-IRsEQw7E_27 0 OTHER FABRIC LUMP BUDGE SO YOU CAN DO IT FURTHER APART
hI-IRsEQw7E_28 0 BUT IN THE IDEA IS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET A NEAT LINE ON YOUR FABRIC THAT DOESN'T SHOW THROUGH

hI-IRsEQw7E_30 0 IT'S PRETTY MUCH INVISIBLE

GHYrASBqbOg_16 0 SO THAT'S A MANO JACK
GHYrASBqbOg_17 0 BUT IF YOU USE THINGS LIKE A STEREO HEADPHONES YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE A STEREO JACK AND THIS HAS GOT TO CONTACTS ON IT AND THIS ISN'T A STEREO PLUG
GHYrASBqbOg_18 0 IT ONLY HAS THE ONE KIND OF CONTACT
GHYrASBqbOg_19 0 BUT IF IT WERE STEREO PLUG IT WOULD HAVE ONE CONTACT HERE AND ONE CONTACT SOMEWHERE ELSE AND SO YOU CAN KIND OF GET THOSE TWO SIGNALS TO THAT ONE BLOOD BUT THIS IS ONLY AMANO PLUG
GHYrASBqbOg_20 0 SO MY JACK STEREO JACKS KIND OF DOESN'T MATTER WHICH ONE USE FOR CIRCUIT BENDING FOR THE MOST PART YOU'RE GOING TO BE MAKING MANO INSTRUMENTS WHEN YOU CIRCUIT BEND

gbvJRSW0RPc_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT OF HOW TO CURE YOUR SLICE AND HIT A HOOK WE'RE GOING TO CONCERN OURSELVES WITH THE CLUB HEAD
gbvJRSW0RPc_2 0 BECAUSE IT'S THE CLUB HEAD THAT HITS THE BALL IN THE BALL KNOWS ALL IN THE ONLY THING THE BALL KNOWS IS IMPACT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THERE BUT IF YOU COULD WATCH THE CLUB HEAD AT HOME IN PRACTICE SWINGS IN YOUR BACKYARD
gbvJRSW0RPc_3 0 I'M WATCHING THE CLUB HEAD AND I KNOW WHAT I WANT THAT CLUB HEAD TO DO
gbvJRSW0RPc_4 0 BECAUSE IF THERE WAS A GLOBE DOWN HERE ON THE GROUND AND I WANTED TO SPIN THAT GLOW IF I TOOK THAT CLUB HEAD AND I'M JUST WATCHING THE CLUB THAT IF I BROUGHT THAT CLUB HEAD INSIDE AND SWUNG THAT CLUB HEAD OUT AND BEFORE I GOT TO THAT GLOBE I RELEASED OR TURNED IT OVER OR FLIP THAT OVER
gbvJRSW0RPc_5 0 INSIDE THAT OVER
gbvJRSW0RPc_6 0 LOOK AT THAT GLOBE LOOK AT THAT YOU'LL BOOM
gbvJRSW0RPc_7 0 THAT IS GOING TO SPIN THAT GLOW
gbvJRSW0RPc_8 0 SO AS A DRILL WATCH THE CLUB HEAD
gbvJRSW0RPc_9 0 YOU COULD EVEN DRAW A LINE ON THE GROUND
gbvJRSW0RPc_10 0 YOU CAN DRAW A LINE ON THE GROUND THAT ISN'T STRAIGHT BUT OUT TO THE RIGHT
gbvJRSW0RPc_11 0 EAT EVEN PUT A SHAFT THERE
gbvJRSW0RPc_12 0 PUT ONE STRAIGHT AND PUT ONE OUT TO THE RIGHT AND SWING OUT TO THE RIGHT INSIDE OUT AND TURN IT OVER
gbvJRSW0RPc_13 0 WATCH THAT CLUB HEAD
gbvJRSW0RPc_14 0 INSIDE OUT AND TURN IT OVER
gbvJRSW0RPc_15 0 DO IT SLOWLY
gbvJRSW0RPc_16 0 DO IT OFTEN AND YOUR GOING TO LEARN THE FUNDAMENTAL MOVES TO HIT A HOOK
GVU1bHfi6lE_1 0 SO LET'S DO WITH THE BACKGROUND LITTLE BIT MORE
GVU1bHfi6lE_2 0 WE'VE GOT THAT SHADOW
GVU1bHfi6lE_3 0 I DON'T LIKE THAT SHADOW OF
GVU1bHfi6lE_4 0 OR AT LEAST CERTAINLY NOT THAT STRONG
GVU1bHfi6lE_5 0 I COULD SOFTEN IT BY DIFFUSING THIS WITH THE DIFFUSION PANEL
GVU1bHfi6lE_6 0 BUT THAT TAKES AWAY THE MAGIC TO A DEGREE
GVU1bHfi6lE_7 0 I'M GOING TO TRY AND GET RID OF THAT THAT SHADOW IN ANOTHER WAY
GVU1bHfi6lE_8 0 PART OF IT IS OUT OF MY FRAME IN THE CAMERA
GVU1bHfi6lE_9 0 BUT I THINK THAT I CAN GET RID OF IT BY ADDING SOME LIGHT BACK IN THERE
GVU1bHfi6lE_10 0 WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN WE TURN THIS LIGHT BACK ON IS IT'S GOING TO MAKE THAT SHADOW LESS NOTICEABLE
GVU1bHfi6lE_11 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO ADD ANOTHER LIGHT
GVU1bHfi6lE_12 0 LET'S ADD ANOTHER LIGHT JUST TO DEAL WITH THE BACKGROUND
GVU1bHfi6lE_13 0 THIS WOULD BE A BACKGROUND LIGHT
GVU1bHfi6lE_14 0 SO I'VE GOT ANOTHER LAMP HERE
GVU1bHfi6lE_15 0 AND I'M GOING TO PUSH PULL IT OVER INTO THIS POSITION HERE WHERE THE SHADOW IS THE STRONGEST
GVU1bHfi6lE_16 0 AND LET'S DIRECTED AT THAT SHADOW AND BRING IT UP
GVU1bHfi6lE_17 0 NOTICE THAT THE SHADOW IS DISAPPEARING AS THIS LIGHT COMES ON AND IS DIRECTED AT THAT SHADOW LOCATION
GVU1bHfi6lE_18 0 A LITTLE HARD TO SEE WHETHER IT'S ENOUGH AND THAT WILL DEPEND UPON THE EXPOSURE THAT I PUT IN THE CAMERA
GVU1bHfi6lE_19 0 BUT THAT HAS AS FAR AS THE CAMERA IS CONCERNED THAT MAIN DARKER SHADOW IS NOW INVISIBLE
GB_EmtzO-Yc_1 0 I'M NANCY FRENSLEY I'M THE TRAINING MANAGER AT THE BERKELEY EAST BAY HUMANE SOCIETY IN BERKELEY CALIFORNIA
GB_EmtzO-Yc_2 0 ADD CURRENTLY THE QUESTION OF THE DAY IS HOW TO RESCUE A MULTI STOP
GB_EmtzO-Yc_3 0 WELL MALTESE ARE SMALL WHITE TOY DOGS
GB_EmtzO-Yc_4 0 OF DEBRIS MALTESE JUST EVERY CUTE THEY'RE VERY CUDDLY
GB_EmtzO-Yc_5 0 THEY HAVE A LOT OF GROOMING NEEDS
GB_EmtzO-Yc_6 0 THEY ARE VERY VERY LONG WHITE HERE AN OLDER DOGS YOU'LL SEE VERY OFTEN THAT YOU KNOW WHAT RIPPED UP HERE AT THE TOP HALF OF THEIR OF THEIR HEAD TO KEEP THEIR EAR OFF THEIR EYES
GB_EmtzO-Yc_7 0 AND THEY'RE VERY SWEET DOGS
GB_EmtzO-Yc_8 0 A MOST OF THE TIME THEY'RE RESCUED BY BREED ORGANIZATIONS
GB_EmtzO-Yc_9 0 MULTI IS THREE CLUBS TO HAVE PUT TOGETHER A RESCUE EVER THEY GET THEM OUT OF HUMANE SOCIETY SHELTERS AND A MUNICIPAL FACILITIES AND PUT THEM INTO FOSTER HOMES
GB_EmtzO-Yc_10 0 SO RESCUING MALTESE IS ACTUALLY PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS A DOG IN ONE
GB_EmtzO-Yc_11 0 SO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO RESCUE WILL MULTI LOOK THEM UP ONLINE
GB_EmtzO-Yc_12 0 LOOK UP REST MALTESE RESCUE ORGANIZATIONS A APPLY TO ADOPT AT THE TOP ONE
GB_EmtzO-Yc_13 0 AND EVERY TIME YOU ADOPT A MALTESE FROM THE BREED ORGANIZATION THAT LEAVES ROOM FOR THEM TO GO GET ANOTHER ONE OUT OF POUNDER SHELTER
gEoJ_Jf47eA_1 0 WHEN UNDERSTANDING BUS IN THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT EVERY TIME YOU CREATE A BUS IT'S SENDING A SIGNAL TO ANOTHER TRACK THAT YOU CREATE
gEoJ_Jf47eA_2 0 SO WHEN I LOOK AT MY MY CHANNEL STRIP I LOOK AT MY SENDS AND EYE SIGN TO SEND IT TO A BUS
gEoJ_Jf47eA_3 0 I'M GOING TO CHOOSE BUS ONE
gEoJ_Jf47eA_4 0 WHAT HAPPENS IS GOING TO CREATE AN AUXILIARY TRACK
gEoJ_Jf47eA_5 0 THIS IS ANOTHER TRACK THAT THE SEAM IS GOING TO GO THROUGH
gEoJ_Jf47eA_6 0 SO WHEN I PLAY THROUGH THIS FIRST ONE I HIT PLAY IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE PLAYING HERE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH I ACTUALLY BUST IT
gEoJ_Jf47eA_7 0 I CONTROL THE LEVEL THAT IT'S BUST OUT WITH WITH HIS DIAL RIGHT HERE
gEoJ_Jf47eA_8 0 IT'S ACTUALLY WILL CONTROLS THE LINE
gEoJ_Jf47eA_9 0 I'M GOING TO PLAY AND SLOWLY BRING IT UP

hjvqiK4Fbc4_2 0 THE BIG THING YOU'RE GOING FOR THAT MATTER CLEAN WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION WISE ON A MOUNTAIN BIKE IS HAVING YOUR WHEELS YOU KNOW HAVING WEIGHT EVENLY DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN YOUR TWO WHEELS AND DOING THAT ARE IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS YOU TO REALLY CONTROL WHAT YOU'RE DOING
hjvqiK4Fbc4_3 0 SO IT'S HARD TO DEMONSTRATE JUST SITTING HERE WHAT I'M DOING LIKE AND JUST EVEN MY GENERAL POSITION
hjvqiK4Fbc4_4 0 IN MY WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION IS ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT ON THE REAR WHEEL SITTING HERE FORTY FOR SOME OF THE FRONT WHEEL
hjvqiK4Fbc4_5 0 THAT'S PRETTY GOOD

gx7_l732h7s_3 0 THEY DO BOTH HAVE A NOSE AND TAIL TO THEM BUT WITH A FREESTYLE BOARD IT'S USUALLY BETWEEN TWO BOARD MEANING THAT NO MATTER WHAT WAY YOU RIDE IT IT'S GOING TO RIDE THE SAND
gx7_l732h7s_4 0 FREESTYLE BOARD IS A LOT MORE FLEXIBLE TO ALLOW YOU TO PERFORM TRICKS ON IT AND YOU GENERALLY RIDE IT WITH A LOT WIDER STANCE THAN ON A FREE RIDE BOARD
gx7_l732h7s_5 0 TO WIDEN YOUR STANCE FIND THE CREAM MARKED FACTORY HOLES AND GO AS FAR AWAY FROM THEM AS YOU CAN TOWARDS EITHER END OF THE BOARD

HFdsk3MZcnk_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS ORESTES GUADA FROM EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE GAME OF PAINTBALL
HFdsk3MZcnk_2 0 THE RULES ON THE GAME HOW IT'S PLAYED IS THEY DIVIDE IT WOULD DIVIDE IT IN WITH THE ELIMINATION
HFdsk3MZcnk_3 0 YOU WOULD HAVE TO SHOOT EVERYBODY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TEAM
HFdsk3MZcnk_4 0 IF YOU ELIMINATE EVERYBODY THE OTHER TEAM WIND DON'T THE TIED UP OR TIME RIGHT OUT
HFdsk3MZcnk_5 0 THERE'S ALWAYS TIME BECAUSE AND SCHEMES TAKE TOO LONG
HFdsk3MZcnk_6 0 THERE IS PROFESSIONAL PAINT BALL IS A DIFFERENT WAY CAUSE NOW TO HAVE FLAG
HFdsk3MZcnk_7 0 SO YOU GOT A SEVEN ON SEVEN YOU SHOOT EVERYBODY AND YOU GOT TO GRAB THEIR FLAG PUT ON THIS SIDE AND THEN THERE'S RECREATIONAL PAINT BALL WHICH IS JUST LIKE FAMILIES COMING OUT HERE SHOOTING EACH OTHER OF THE PLAY CAPTURE THE FLAG STUFF THAT BUT IT'S MOAN IT'S MAINLY IN THE NATION
gosCYV0wqAE_2 0 I'M PETE HOUSES AND I'M AN ART TEACHER AND TODAY I REPRESENT EXPERT VILLAGE DOT COM
gosCYV0wqAE_3 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE DRAWING AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DRAW
gosCYV0wqAE_4 0 AND LIKE ANY WRITER USUALLY WILL CHOOSE SOMETHING HERE SHE WANTS TO WRITE ABOUT YOU NEED TO BE THE SAME WAY WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DRAW
gosCYV0wqAE_5 0 IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING THAT WERE PASSIONATE OR EXCITED ABOUT BECAUSE IF NOT WE'RE GOING TO LOSE INTEREST QUICKLY AND PLAY IT IN OUR TIPS DRAWN SOMETHING
gosCYV0wqAE_6 0 IF I GO BACK IN MY MEMORY FAR BACK AND THINK OF SOME OF THE EARLIEST THINGS I STARTED DRAWING I THINK OF ANIMALS
gosCYV0wqAE_7 0 I THINK OF FAMILY PETS AND I ALSO THINK OF AUTOMOBILES BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN THEM
gosCYV0wqAE_8 0 SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOCUS AND SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO DRAW AND THEN WE NEED TO CONSIDER WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE DRAWING IN WHERE WE'RE GOING TO SET UP
gosCYV0wqAE_9 0 FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WERE DOING A LANDSCAPE DRAWING WHICH WE'RE NOT TODAY YOU WANT TO BE OUTSIDE IN THE SAME GOES FOR NATURAL TYPE DRAWINGS IN THE FIELD IF YOU WILL WITH WILD ANIMALS OR MAYBE THE DOMESTIC CAT THAT JUST FROM THE RIGHT PERSPECTIVE KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A WILD TIGER
gosCYV0wqAE_10 0 BUT ANOTHER LITTLE TRICK IS TO MAYBE WORK FROM A PHOTOGRAPH OR PHOTOGRAPHS
gosCYV0wqAE_11 0 THE SAME CAN BE APPLIED TO BALL FIGURE STUDIES HUMANS IF YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A CONVENIENT MODEL LIKE YOUR MOM AROUND OR ARE SIMPLY OR AUTOMOBILES SOMETHING I'VE ALSO DRAWN SINCE I WAS LITTLE
gosCYV0wqAE_12 0 YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO HAVE A STATIC EXAMPLE WHEN YOUR DRIVEWAY ARE PARKED ON THE STREET
gosCYV0wqAE_13 0 WHY THIS STUFF CAN COME FROM YOU GASKET RIGHT UP HERE
gosCYV0wqAE_14 0 BUT IT'S IMPORTANT AGAIN TO REMEMBER THAT YOU SHOULD DRAW SOMETHING THAT INTEREST YOU HAVE THAT CAN COME FROM YOUR TRAVEL SECOND COME FROM JUST DAY AND DAY OUT ACTIVITIES DRY YOU BEING IN TOWN LOOKING UP IN ARCHITECTURE DRIVING TO THE FREEWAY ZANUSSI ANOTHER CARS
gosCYV0wqAE_15 0 SO FIND YOUR SUBJECT LAYOUT YOUR AREA LETS GET READY TO BEGIN

Gae3w4TYuvE_5 0 JUST A LITTLE TRICK REAL QUICK SPRAY YOUR CUT DOWN WITH A LITTLE COOKING SPRAY FIRST AND TAKE A LOT BECAUSE IF YOU EVER MEASURE PEANUT BUTTER FOR A HALF OF IT STAYS IN THE MEASURING CUP
Gae3w4TYuvE_6 0 IT'S A PAIN IN THE NECK AMONG OTHER THINGS SO WE ARE JUST GOING TO SPRAY THAT DOWN AND THEN MEASURE IT OUT
Gae3w4TYuvE_7 0 TRUST ME WILL COME OUT MUCH MUCH EASIER AND EASIER WHEN I COME UP WITH THIS PEANUT BUTTER WHO LOVE PEANUT BUTTER
Gae3w4TYuvE_8 0 I'LL BE HONEST OKAY LET'S GET THAT IN THERE YOU HAVE YES COMING OFF MUCH EASIER TO OTHER JUST CAME RIGHT NOW I'M NOT STRUM OF FIGHT WITH IT LIKE I WOULD'VE BUT IT SPRAY DOWN SO THAT HELPS A LOT
Gae3w4TYuvE_9 0 OKAY VERY NICE OKAY TO HAVE OUR PEANUT BUTTER ARE STAR PUT THAT IN THEIR LITTLE MESSY THAT'S OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD A TABLESPOON OF MILK FOR MY GIANT HEARTS IN HEARTS SAID OF MILK BLUE ONE OF THREE AND A STICK A ROOM TEMPERATURE BUTTER

gsNEiNEnHV4_1 0 SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO IN AND GO INTO YOUR ESPRESSO GRINDERS JOE USED TO GRIND YOUR BEANS
gsNEiNEnHV4_2 0 RIGHT HERE I HAVE ONE EXAMPLE OF A HOME ESPRESSO GRINDER AND HOW IT WORKS IS YOU HAVE YOUR HOPPER HERE WHERE YOU THROW YOUR BEANS INTO
gsNEiNEnHV4_3 0 HE DROPS DOWN INTO THE AREA WHERE IT'S ACTUALLY GROUND
gsNEiNEnHV4_4 0 SPITS IT OUT INTO THE DOSING CHAMBER HERE
gsNEiNEnHV4_5 0 IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE DOSING CHAMBER I HAVE A LEVER TO PULL THE COFFEE OUT OF THE DOSING CHAMBER
gsNEiNEnHV4_6 0 YOU HAVE A REST HERE TO WRITE LATER ON WE'LL BE RESTING THE PORTER FILTER THERE TO THOSE COFFEE INTO THE PORTA FILTER BASKET
gsNEiNEnHV4_7 0 AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE UP OVER HERE AS WELL I HAVE A STRETCH TO TURN ON THE ESPRESSO GRINDER
gsNEiNEnHV4_8 0 ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS THAT AFFECTS ESPRESSO SHOTS IS THE COARSENESS OF THE GRIME AND THAT AFFECTS THE TIME OF THE SHOTS ON THIS ESPRESSO GRINDER AS MARKED HERE ON THE GRINDER
gsNEiNEnHV4_9 0 YOU TURN THIS CALL THE TURN THIS LITTLE METAL COLOR COUNTER CLOCKWISE TO GRIND THE COFFEE MORE FINE AND CLOCKWISE TO GRIND IT MORE COARSE
gsNEiNEnHV4_10 0 WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE IS THE FINER THE COFFEE IS GROUND THE MORE RESISTANCE THAT IT'S CREATING FROM THE WATER WE'RE PASSES THROUGH DURING THE EXTRACTION PROCESS OF THE ESPRESSO SHOTS
gsNEiNEnHV4_11 0 IF YOU'RE A COFFEE IS GROUND COARSER THAN THAT GOES LESS RESISTANCE THE WATER HAS THE FASTER TO STRESS OF SHOTS ARE GOING TO TAKE AND THE LAST TIME THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE TO PULL THE SHOT
gsNEiNEnHV4_12 0 THE FINER THE COFFEE IS THE LONGER THE WATER IS GOING TO TAKE TWO PASSES THE COFFEE WISPS A SHOT
gsNEiNEnHV4_13 0 SO IF YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT LIKE A SMALL OR HOME GRINDER LIKE THIS ONE HERE BASICALLY ARE GOING TO DO IS IS FILL UP THAT WITH YOUR ESPRESSO BEANS AND PUT THE TOP ON IT AND BEGIN GRINDING THE GRINDING THE BEANS
gsNEiNEnHV4_14 0 THE ONLY WAY TO CONTROL COFFEE COARSENESS THEIR GRIND COARSENESS ON THE GRINDER LIKE THIS IS BY TIME OF THE GRIND

G7zu6UH0QoM_1 0 THE NEXT THING THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS YOUR ESPRESSO GRINDERS
G7zu6UH0QoM_2 0 AND SO IF WE HAVE AS A HOME ESPRESSO GRINDER LIKE THIS ONE HERE YOU HAVE YOUR HOPPER THE COFFEE GOES INTO IT FEEDS INTO WHERE THE COFFEE IS GROUND SPITS IT INTO THE DOSING CHAMBER
G7zu6UH0QoM_3 0 YOUR RIGHT HAND SIDE WE HAVE THE LEVER THAT CONTROLS THE DOSING CHAMBER AND THEN SWITCH TO TURN IT ON
G7zu6UH0QoM_4 0 YOU HAVE A REST DOWN HERE TO REST THE PORTER FILTER ON WHILE YOU'RE DOSE IT INTO THE PORTER FILTER
G7zu6UH0QoM_5 0 ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT GOES INTO THE ESPRESSO PREPARATION PROCESS IS THE COARSENESS OF THE GRIND SAY YOU'RE USING FOR THE ESPRESSO SHOTS
G7zu6UH0QoM_6 0 ON A GRINDER LIKE THIS HOW YOU CONTROL THAT IS AS IT'S MARCH HERE ON THE GRINDER COUNTER CLOCKWISE GRINDS THE COFFEE FINER AND CLOCKWISE GRINDS ACCOUNT THE COFFEE COARSER
G7zu6UH0QoM_7 0 WHEN YOU'RE GRINDING THE COFFEE FINER IT'S CREATING MORE RESISTANCE FOR THE WATER WHEN IT'S PASSING THROUGH AND EXTRACTING THE COFFEE FOR THE SHOT OF ESPRESSO
G7zu6UH0QoM_8 0 SO IF YOU'RE CREATING MORE RESISTANCE IN THE SHOT IS GOING TO PULL SLOW OR TAKE LONGER TO PULL THE COURSE OF THE COFFEE IS BEING THAT THE LESS RESISTANCE THAT THE WATER HATS AND THE QUICKER THE SHOTS IS GOING TO PULL
G7zu6UH0QoM_9 0 IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THE SMALLER HOME BLADE GRINDERS THAT YOU'RE USING TO GRIND YOUR COFFEE FOR YOUR ESPRESSO THEN ALL YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS PUT THE COFFEE IN THERE LIKE NORMAL AND WHEN YOU HIT THE BUTTON TO START GRINDING THE COFFEE THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU HAVE TO CONTROL HOW FIND YOU'RE GRINDING THE COFFEE IS BY THE LENGTH OF TIME LENGTH OF TIME THAT YOU GRIND THE COFFEE
G7zu6UH0QoM_10 0 FOR ESPRESSO WARM GUIDELINE TO GO BY IS IT'S TWENTY SECONDS OR MORE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP THE GRINDER ONTO GRIND THE COFFEE
G7zu6UH0QoM_11 0 IT'S GOING TO BE CONSIDERABLY FINER THAN A NORMAL CUP OF COFFEE
GIkXnMUo4wQ_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS KAREN MOCHA SOUNDS AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT CRAFTING WITH GOURDS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_2 0 COLOR IN YOUR GOURDS OKAY THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO COLOR GOURDS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_3 0 AND SOME OF THE THINGS YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT FIRST IS WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO PAINT YOUR INSIDE YOUR DESIGN FIRST OR WHETHER YOU WERE GOING TO DO THE OUTSIDE OF THE GOURD OR HOW MUCH IS GOING TO BE THE NATURAL BORDER SHOWING
GIkXnMUo4wQ_4 0 BUT SOME OF THE THINGS YOU CAN USE A LOT TO DO THIS THIS PARTICULAR GOURD HAS BEND THE GOURD ITSELF A STAINED WITH LETTER DYES THE COLOR IN HERE THAT YOU SEE HAS BEEN DONE WITH ACRYLIC JUST YOUR BASIC ACRYLIC PAINTS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_5 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE WOOD STAINS WOULD STAINS WORK VERY WELL FOR DOING THE OVERALL GOURD
GIkXnMUo4wQ_6 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE A SHOE POLISHED WORKS VERY WELL TO GET A NICE SHINE AND SOME COLOR IN ON IT
GIkXnMUo4wQ_7 0 FOR YOUR DESIGNS AND SOME OF THE FINER WORK YOU CAN USE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A PERMANENT MAGIC MARKER
GIkXnMUo4wQ_8 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE IT ON WHAT THEY HAVE OUT ON THE MARKET NOW THEY'RE CALLED PAINT PANS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_9 0 PAINT PENS WORK REALLY WELL
GIkXnMUo4wQ_10 0 THERE'S ALSO THE DICE THAT YOU USE FOR RUBBER STAMPING THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT DYES OUT THERE FOR THAT THAT WORK
GIkXnMUo4wQ_11 0 AND THERE'S ALSO FABRIC DICE THEY DON'T WORK REALLY WELL BUT YOU CAN AGAIN EXPERIMENT WITH ANY OF THESE
GIkXnMUo4wQ_12 0 THE BEST THING TO DO IF YOU GO TO LIKE A GOURD FORM AND BY YOUR GOURDS THEY ALMOST ALWAYS WILL GIVE YOU THE BROKEN BITS AND PIECES OF THE GOURD
GIkXnMUo4wQ_13 0 FOR THE OR IS GOING TO PICK UP BECAUSE YOU CAN USE THOSE AS YOUR PRACTICE PIECES TO SEE HOW YOUR COLOR IS GOING TO LOOK HOW THE DYE IS GOING TO WORK WITH YOUR ACRYLICS AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO INTERACT
GIkXnMUo4wQ_14 0 AND AGAIN YOUR YOUR SHADING AND IS YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE COLOR THAT YOU WANT AS IT TOO DARK IS IT TOO LIGHT
GIkXnMUo4wQ_15 0 SOMETHING ELSE TO KEEP IN MIND WITH YOUR LEATHER DYES THE LEATHER DYES WILL FADE OVER TIME
GIkXnMUo4wQ_16 0 THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO TRY TO PREVENT THAT ONE BIG AND DO YOUR ACRYLIC SEALANT ONCE YOUR PROJECTS DON
GIkXnMUo4wQ_17 0 BUT THEY TASTE SO EVEN WITH THAT THE LEATHER GUYS WILL TEND TO FADE OVER TIME
GIkXnMUo4wQ_18 0 THE WOOD STAINS LAST A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND THE THAT WE'VE GOT SOME A PRODUCT OUT THERE NOW CALLED A GOURD A GOURD THE INK DIE THAT IS MORE COLOR FAST
GIkXnMUo4wQ_19 0 SO YOU CAN AGAIN GO VERY VERY SIMPLE WITH YOUR JUST BASIC ACRYLIC PAINTS IN MAGIC MARKERS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_20 0 LEATHER DICED THESE COME ABOUT FOUR FOR FIFTY A BOTTLE LOTS OF DIFFERENT COLORS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_21 0 WOULD STAINS YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE LAYING AROUND THE HOUSE I'M SHOE POLISHING MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE LINE AROUND THE HOUSE SO LOTS OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO ACTUALLY GET AND SOME COLOR ON YOUR GOURD
HBbFaTK359U_1 0 AND IT'S SMOOTHING IS A PROCESS WHERE AFTER YOU HAVE QUANTIZE SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE GAPS IN BETWEEN YOUR AUDIO FILES AND GAPS LITTLE SPACES BETWEEN YOUR REGIONS
HBbFaTK359U_2 0 SO WHAT I DID SMOOTHING DOES IT APPLIES CROSS FADES IN BETWEEN EACH OF THOSE JUST ALLOW FOR SMOOTH TRANSITIONS AND JUST SEEN A BETTER SOUND ALL TOGETHER
HBbFaTK359U_3 0 SO WITH ANY SMOOTHING AS SOON AS LONG AS I HAVE CONFORM THE MY REGIONS AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S QUANTIZE THE WAY I WANTED KNOCKING SHOES AND IT'S MOVING AND I CAN FEEL THE GAS OR TO FILL THE GAPS WITH CROSS FADES
HBbFaTK359U_4 0 SO WHAT WE'LL DO IS ON THE PHOTOGRAPH ACROSS WAYS AND WE MY FIVE NO SECONDS AND THEN SMOOTH IT
HBbFaTK359U_5 0 WHAT THIS DOES IS GOING TO REALLY SMOOTH IN MY WHOLE TRACK UP SO THAT ALL THE GAPS ARE SEAMLESS AND THERE'S NO REAL TYPE OF A BREAKS OR ANY TYPE OF LIKE THIS LIKE PAUSES WITHIN THAT WITHIN THE TRACK
HBbFaTK359U_6 0 YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU DO THIS AS WELL IT LIKE THAT THE GAPS AND THE GAPS SOME OF THEM MIGHT NOT SOUND EXACTLY WHERE YOU WANT
HBbFaTK359U_7 0 SO WHEN YOU DO YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU LISTEN TO IMMEDIATELY AFTER JUST MAKE SURE THAT IT'S RIGHT AND SOUNDS WITH THAT YOU WANT IT
gNEk8QqEOY0_1 0 I'M LES WHITLEY
gNEk8QqEOY0_2 0 YOU'RE GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TONING THE INNER THIGHS
gNEk8QqEOY0_3 0 THE FIRST THING I LIKE TO ADDRESSES SPECIFICALLY ISOLATING ASPECTS OR ANGLES OF THE MUSCLE ESPECIALLY THE LOWER BODY
gNEk8QqEOY0_4 0 THE TONE THE INNER THIGH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MUSCLE IT'S TYPICALLY NOT MUCH BIGGER THAN THE SIZE OF YOUR ROUND OF MY FINGER
gNEk8QqEOY0_5 0 THE MOST OF THE INNER THIGHS ARE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING THE LEG INTO THE MID LINE OF THE BODY OR ABDUCTION AND ADDING TO THE INSIDE
gNEk8QqEOY0_6 0 SO TYPICALLY YOU MAY SEE SOMEONE LINE ON THEIR SIDE DOING INSIDE LEG RAISES OR MACHINE TO TRAIN THAT MUSCLE
gNEk8QqEOY0_7 0 AGAIN THAT MUSCLE BE WHAT IT IS IS VERY SMALL
gNEk8QqEOY0_8 0 SO TO OVER TRAINER TRAINING TO MAKE IT STRONG WILL TAKE A LOT OF EFFORT
gNEk8QqEOY0_9 0 OVERALL TYPICALLY RESPONSIVE TONING THIGHS IS TO GET THE MORE MUSCULAR APPEARANCE REMOVING THE BODY FAT
gNEk8QqEOY0_10 0 THAT REQUIRES PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO BURN CALORIES OR EXPEND CALORIES AS WELL AS MODIFYING DIETARY INTO IT
gNEk8QqEOY0_11 0 ONE EXERCISE FOR TRAINING THE OVERALL MUSCULATURE THE LEGS NOT ONLY THE INNER THIGH THE OUTER THIGH FOR THE THIGH BACK OF THE THIGH AS WELL AS THE HIPS IS THE SQUAT
gNEk8QqEOY0_12 0 THE BASIC SQUAT WILL BEGIN BY ADDRESSING THE BAR HANDS EVEN STEPPING UNDERNEATH BALANCING THE WAY ACROSS THE UPPER PART OF THE BACK MORE PART THE SHOULDERS
gNEk8QqEOY0_13 0 HE CAN BE ARRANGED IN A VARIETY OF POSITIONS
gNEk8QqEOY0_14 0 TOES POINTED OUT WILL SLIGHTLY EMPHASIZE MORE THEATER ASPECT OF THE THIGH
gNEk8QqEOY0_15 0 THIS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AND DANCING IS A PLIE A SQUAT
gNEk8QqEOY0_16 0 THESE WILL FOLLOW THE SAME DIRECTION THE TOES AS YOU LOWER YOURSELF DOWN UNDER GOOD CONTROL
gNEk8QqEOY0_17 0 TRYING TO MAKE AN UPRIGHT SPINE POSITION
gNEk8QqEOY0_18 0 TOES POINTED STRAIGHT AHEAD WILL WORK MORE OUTER ASPECTS OF THE THIGHS BUT EMPHASIZING SPECIFICALLY THE INNER
gNEk8QqEOY0_19 0 WORKING ON RANGE OF MOTION TOES POINTED SLIGHTLY OUT NICE FALLING SAME DIRECTION
gNEk8QqEOY0_20 0 YOU CONTROL MOTION
gNEk8QqEOY0_21 0 ALL THE WAY UP ALL THE WAY DOWN
gNEk8QqEOY0_22 0 ALWAYS RACK THE BAR UNDER CONTROL
gNEk8QqEOY0_23 0 WE TRAIN THE LEG IS A WHOLE NOT EMPHASIZING ANY ONE PARTICULAR PART BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING FOR BALANCE OVERALL SHAPE AS WELL AS MUSCULARLY LEG WILL HAVING A NICELY LOOK AS WELL
GFasV9Lpgv0_1 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IN THE PORCELAIN PAINTING ANOTHER TOOL THAT WE USE CALLED WIPE OUT TOOL
GFasV9Lpgv0_2 0 AND YOU HAVE A HARDER WIPE OUT TOOLS LIKE THIS AND YOU HAVE A SOFTER ONES LIKE THIS
GFasV9Lpgv0_3 0 YOU HAVE A LITTLE MORE CONTROL WITH THE HARD ONES BUT ALL OF THEM HAVE THEIR USE
GFasV9Lpgv0_4 0 THIS ONE HAS THE WEDGE POINT VERY VERY SOFT
GFasV9Lpgv0_5 0 THIS ONE HAS THE HARDER SHARP POINT
GFasV9Lpgv0_6 0 AND THIS ONE AND THIS ONE ARE VERY SIMILAR EXCEPT THE BLUE IS MUCH FIRMER THAN THIS ONE
GFasV9Lpgv0_7 0 SO YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THE DIFFERENCE THERE
GFasV9Lpgv0_8 0 AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE SOME THAT ARE LIKE A FOAM RUBBER
GFasV9Lpgv0_9 0 AND YOU CAN DO WITH DIFFERENT TECHNIQUE WITH THAT
GFasV9Lpgv0_10 0 SO I'LL SHOW YOU QUICKLY HOW WE USE THE WIPE OUT TOOLS
GFasV9Lpgv0_11 0 FOR INSTANCE ON THIS TO SHAPE FLOWER PETALS OR LEAVES AND YOU CAN ALSO MAKE DESIGNS LIKE THIS
GFasV9Lpgv0_12 0 AND THEN YOU COME BACK WITH YOUR BRUSH AND YOU START AT THAT AND YOU CAN WIPE OUT LIKE THAT
GFasV9Lpgv0_13 0 IT CAN GIVE YOU A NICE CLEAR EDGE TO START WITH
GFasV9Lpgv0_14 0 THE THING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT PORCELAIN PAINTING IS IS IT'S SIMILAR TO WATER COLOR PAINTING
GFasV9Lpgv0_15 0 IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE HIGHLIGHTS THAT YOU WANT IN BEFORE YOU FIRE BECAUSE YOU CAN NOT GET THEM BACK
GFasV9Lpgv0_16 0 SO GENERALLY ON THE FIRST FIRE YOU CONCENTRATE ON GETTING THE SHAPE OF YOUR PAINTING IN AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO HAVE ALL THE HIGHLIGHTS WHERE YOU WANT HIM AND BE LIGHTNESS THAT YOU WANT HIM BECAUSE YOU CANNOT GO BACK AND ADD PAINT ON TOP TO LIGHTEN LIKE YOU DO WITH OIL PAINT OR ACRYLIC PAINT
GFasV9Lpgv0_17 0 SO IT'S JUST ALMOST REVERSED FROM ANY TYPE OF OIL PAINTING YOU MAY HAVE EVER DONE
GFasV9Lpgv0_18 0 AND THAT'S WHAT YOU USE THE WIPE OUT TOOLS AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO BLEND THIS
GFasV9Lpgv0_19 0 AND THE SYNTHETIC BRUSHES TO CREATE THESE
GFasV9Lpgv0_20 0 SO THAT GIVES YOU AN EXAMPLE
GFasV9Lpgv0_21 0 ANOTHER THING THAT WE CAN USE AS WIPE OUT TOOL IS SAIL
GFasV9Lpgv0_22 0 THIS LOOKS REALLY BAD BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF PAINT ON IT BUT IT'S STILL WORKS GREAT
GFasV9Lpgv0_23 0 AND YOU CAN USE IT WRAPPED AROUND YOUR FINGER FOR A REAL SHARP WIPE OUT LIKE THIS
GFasV9Lpgv0_24 0 WE ALSO USE THE POLY FEEL
GFasV9Lpgv0_25 0 THAT'S WHAT'S IS USED IN PILLOWS YOU JUST GET IT IN ANY SEWING SHOP OR CRAFT SHOPS
GFasV9Lpgv0_26 0 YOU WRAP IT IN THE SILK LIKE THIS AND YOU CAN USE IT TO CLEAN AROUND YOUR PAINTING
GFasV9Lpgv0_27 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE IT FOR WIPE OUT TO CREATE THINGS THAT YOU WANT IN A DIFFERENT MANNER
GFasV9Lpgv0_28 0 SO IT'S ANOTHER VERY GOOD TOOL
GFasV9Lpgv0_29 0 AND USUALLY WHEN WE ARE FINISHED WITH THE PAINTING WE WILL GO AROUND AND CLEAN UP ALL THE EXCESS PAINT AROUND BECAUSE ONCE THE PAINTS THERE IT'S GOING TO BE FIRED IN THE GLAZE
GFasV9Lpgv0_30 0 AND SO THAT IS SOME OF THE WIPE OUT TOOLS THAT WE USE
gJK0LpbTbEE_1 0 MY NAME IS ANTHONY <UNK> AND I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT NIGHTTIME PHOTOGRAPHY LIGHTING EFFECTS
gJK0LpbTbEE_2 0 NOW NIGHT TIME PHOTOGRAPHY CAN BE VERY INTERESTING WITH THE SKY LINE TO THE CITIES AND ONE THING THAT I LIKE TO DO IS THAT I WOULD GO OVER IT AND THAT GET ON TOP OF A HIGH BUILDING MAYBE PHOTOGRAPHING A CERTAIN CITY
gJK0LpbTbEE_3 0 AND ONE THING ABOUT NIGHTTIME PHOTOGRAPHY IS IT'S LOW LIGHT SO THE SHUTTER SPEED THAT I WAS USING MIGHT BE VERY SLOW
gJK0LpbTbEE_4 0 SO STRING OF CARS MOVING ALONG SIDE THE HIGHWAY CAN ACTUALLY LOOK JUST LIKE ONE BIG BLUR OF LIGHT COMING ALONG
gJK0LpbTbEE_5 0 NOW THAT'S ONE EFFECT OF NIGHTTIME PHOTOGRAPHY THAT YOU CAN UTILIZE TO YOUR ADVANTAGE TO MAKE IT EXTREMELY INTERESTING PICTURE
gJK0LpbTbEE_6 0 BY LEAVING THE SHUTTER OPEN AND ANY KIND OF MOVING THE LIGHT IS REALLY JUST GOING TO CAPTURE ONTO YOUR IMAGE LIKE A CERTAIN WAY
gJK0LpbTbEE_7 0 NEON OFTEN DOES THAT TOO
gJK0LpbTbEE_8 0 WHEN I PHOTOGRAPH SOMETIMES IN BARS OR AN RESTAURANTS IF I AM PHOTOGRAPHING YOU'LL ACTUALLY SEE THE BLUR OF THE KNEE ON BEHIND MY SUBJECTS'
gJK0LpbTbEE_9 0 I ALWAYS LIKE TO USE THAT EFFECT ALSO
gJK0LpbTbEE_10 0 ONE THING ABOUT NIGHTTIME PHOTOGRAPHY TO THAT I ALWAYS THINK IS A REALLY FUN THING TO PLAY WITH SOMETIMES IS TURN THE LIGHTS OFTEN A ROOM AND LEAVE YOUR SHUTTER OPEN ON YOUR CAMERA
gJK0LpbTbEE_11 0 AND YOU CAN MAYBE HAVE A FRIEND OR WHOEVER YOU'RE TAKING PICTURES OF ACTUALLY TRACE THE OUTLINE OF THEMSELVES WITH A SMALL PAN LINE
gJK0LpbTbEE_12 0 AND THEN IF YOU CLOSE THE SHUTTER YOU'LL ACTUALLY SEE THE IMAGES THAT PERSON ON YOUR CAMERA
gJK0LpbTbEE_13 0 THAT'S A REALLY FUN TRICK TO PLAY WITH DIGITAL CAMERAS WITH KIDS
gJK0LpbTbEE_14 0 I LIKE TO EXPLAIN PHOTOGRAPHY LIKE THAT TO PEOPLE'S
gJK0LpbTbEE_15 0 AND THOSE ARE SOME INTERESTING NIGHTTIME EFFECTS THAT YOU CAN USE BUT PHOTOGRAPHY
GkoeDMrq0Kw_1 0 OKAY NOW ON THE WHITE FOR THE REST THE EYE
GkoeDMrq0Kw_2 0 SO TO CLEAN THE BRUSH A STICK THE BRUSH NOT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM TO STICK IT IN THERE
GkoeDMrq0Kw_3 0 DON'T SWIRL IT AROUND AND WIPE OFF THE PAINT ON TO YOUR PAPER TOWEL
GkoeDMrq0Kw_4 0 THAT WAY YOUR SOLVENT WON'T GET DIRTY
GkoeDMrq0Kw_5 0 AND YOU WILL HAVE TO REPLACE IT AS OFTEN
GkoeDMrq0Kw_6 0 IT'S STILL WILL GET DIRT IS WE'LL TAKE A LOT LONGER TO GET THERE WE GO
GkoeDMrq0Kw_7 0 OKAY NOW SO I'M GOING TO GO INTO THE DIRECT WHITE
GkoeDMrq0Kw_8 0 YOU NOTICE THAT WHEN I PUT THE COLOR AND PICK UP COLOR I JUST PICK UP COLOR ALL PART THE WHITE NOT ALL OF IT
GkoeDMrq0Kw_9 0 SO I LEFT A LOT OF WHAT I CALL BIRDS IN WHITE
GkoeDMrq0Kw_10 0 AND TOUCH THE ANY OTHER COLORS
GkoeDMrq0Kw_11 0 AND I'M GOING TO PUT THE WHITE IN
GkoeDMrq0Kw_12 0 YOU SAY WELL THERE'S ALREADY WHITE CAMAS THERE
GkoeDMrq0Kw_13 0 YES BUT WE NEED SOME GRADATION IN THERE AS WELL TOO
GkoeDMrq0Kw_14 0 BECAUSE IT IS AN ALL PERFECTLY WIDE

H3y6mHtRF3o_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO FOLD A PAIR OF MAN'S DRESS TROUSERS
H3y6mHtRF3o_4 0 FIRST THING I WOULD DO IS GO TO THE FRENCH AND HACK THEM OR SIT THEM IF YOU WANT TO
H3y6mHtRF3o_5 0 RIGHT WHERE THE FOR THESE HAVE DEALT WITH SOME OF THE PANTS DON'T HAVE BELT LOOPS
H3y6mHtRF3o_6 0 WE'RE GOING TO FOLD THAT TOGETHER RIGHT ABOUT WHERE THE BELT LOOPS ARE THEM ON THIS PARTICULAR APPEAR
H3y6mHtRF3o_7 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO LET THEM DROP DOWN
H3y6mHtRF3o_8 0 AND I'M HOLDING IT AT THAT SECTION
H3y6mHtRF3o_9 0 WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS WHERE IT IS TO THE PLEAT IN THE FRONT
H3y6mHtRF3o_10 0 USUALLY THERE'S A LITTLE POINT HERE THIS BEEN MADE ON YOUR TROUSERS
H3y6mHtRF3o_11 0 THERE WE GO
H3y6mHtRF3o_12 0 I'VE GOT THAT
H3y6mHtRF3o_13 0 IF YOU DON'T FIND ONE JUST TRY TO LINE UP THE SEAMS AND SEE IF YOU CAN GET THE SEAMS LINED UP
H3y6mHtRF3o_14 0 JUST SOME WAY TO HAVE A STRAIGHT ANGLE SO THAT THE THE PANTS HAVE A AN EASY WAY TO JUST FOLD IN A NATURAL WAY RATHER THAN A DIFFICULT WAY
H3y6mHtRF3o_15 0 SO ANYWAY THAT'S WHAT I DO
H3y6mHtRF3o_16 0 I GRAB THAT AND I TRY AND FLATTEN IT OUT
H3y6mHtRF3o_17 0 TO FIND YOUR CREASE IS JUST FLATTEN THE MOUNT
H3y6mHtRF3o_18 0 AND TYPICALLY IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE ON A HANGER THERE WOULD BE A MARKING APPROXIMATELY RIGHT THERE
H3y6mHtRF3o_19 0 I LIKE TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE LEVEL
H3y6mHtRF3o_20 0 IF YOU DIDN'T LEVEL WANT TO HANG OR SOMETIMES THEY FALL OFF BECAUSE THE TOPS TOO HEAVY
H3y6mHtRF3o_22 0 NOW BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON UP HERE YOU CAN FOLD IT INTO ITSELF THAT WAY BUT THEN WHAT YOU'VE GOT ON THE BACKSIDE OR TOO LITTLE LEGS FLOPPING AROUND SO WHAT I DO IS PUT THE LEGS ON THE INSIDE
H3y6mHtRF3o_23 0 AND THERE YOU GO
H3y6mHtRF3o_24 0 NOW IF YOU'RE GOING SOMEWHERE IN THESE PANTS NEED TO BE WORN I WOULD SUGGEST TAKING THEM OUT OF A BAG IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE A BETTER IF YOU'RE GOING TO WEAR THEM
H3y6mHtRF3o_25 0 AND LET THEM JUST STRAIGHT
H3y6mHtRF3o_26 0 BE STRAIGHT FOR WELL EITHER HANGING ARE LAYING SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE CREASES AND
H3y6mHtRF3o_27 0 IN OUR NEXT SEGMENT I'LL BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO FOLD ANOTHER PIECE OF CLOTHING
H5xLkTmh-YU_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHILE YOU'RE CLEANING IT AND PULLING OUT SOME OF THE FINE TO BREATHE OUT OF THIS SCREEN ENCLOSURE YOU MAY NOTICE THAT SOME OF THE LITTLE PIECES FALL DOWN BELOW
H5xLkTmh-YU_2 0 THAT'S OKAY
H5xLkTmh-YU_3 0 SOMETIMES IF THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PINE NEEDLE JUST STICKING IT I MIGHT PUSH IT THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WHEN I'M DONE WITH THIS JOB OF CLEANING THE SCREEN ENCLOSURE I'LL HAVE TO CLEAN THE POOL
H5xLkTmh-YU_4 0 ALSO THE POOL THAT
H5xLkTmh-YU_5 0 ALSO AT THIS TIME IT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA TO CHIP INSPECT YOUR SCREEN ENCLOSURE FOR ANY RIPS OR TEARS IN ANY OF THE SCREEN IS TO HAVE THOSE REPAIRED AS WELL
H5xLkTmh-YU_6 0 SO WHILE YOU'RE UP HERE OF DOING THE FINE TUNING AND CLEANING THIS AREA HERE IS VERY CLEAN
H5xLkTmh-YU_7 0 AND I DON'T SEE ANY TEARS
H5xLkTmh-YU_8 0 WHENEVER BRANCHES LAND ON THE SCREEN ENCLOSURE I KNOW THERE'S A BRANCH ON THAT SECTION SO WE'LL HAVE TO KEEP A WATCH FLY OUT FOR ANY TEARS OR ANY ANY REPAIRS THEM I NEED TO BE DONE TO THE POOL ENCLOSURE
HimMjk-1rg4_1 0 IF YOU FEED YOUR DOG RAW MEAT OR YOU MIGHT NICE TO START ACTUALLY WEIGHING THE FOOD YOU'RE GIVING THEM
HimMjk-1rg4_2 0 THESE ARE CHICKEN NEXT
HimMjk-1rg4_3 0 SO THE DOG THOSE YOUNGER AN ACTIVE YOU MIGHT JUST THROW A BUNCH OF CHICKEN NEXT IN AND THE MONITOR DURING THE DOG'S WEIGHT AS YOU GO ALONG
HimMjk-1rg4_4 0 IF THEY GET OLDER YOU MIGHT NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE PRECISE ABOUT HOW MUCH IN FACT YOUR DOG'S EATING
HimMjk-1rg4_5 0 SO GETTING YOURSELF A SCALE SO YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY HOW MUCH YOU'RE FEEDING YOUR DOG
HimMjk-1rg4_6 0 IF IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU'RE FEEDING A CERTAIN AMOUNT AND YOUR DOG CONTINUES TO BE HEAVY OR IN FACT GAIN WEIGHT THEN YOU WOULD ACTUALLY JUST FEED LESS PREMI OFF UNTIL YOU HIT UPON THE AMOUNT THAT YOU WANT TO FEED
HimMjk-1rg4_7 0 ANOTHER THING THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT WITH DIET IS SUPPLEMENTS ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A LARGE BREED DOG
HimMjk-1rg4_8 0 YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE A JOINT HEALTH SUPPLEMENT
HimMjk-1rg4_9 0 YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD SOMETHING
HimMjk-1rg4_10 0 THESE ARE TABLETS CHEWABLE TABLETS
HimMjk-1rg4_11 0 YOU MAY WANT TO ADD SOMETHING TO THEIR DIET
HimMjk-1rg4_12 0 YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD DIGESTIVE ENZYMES
HimMjk-1rg4_13 0 CERTAINLY YOGURT WITH WHOLE CULTURES ARE VERY GOOD BUT IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FOR YOU TO DEFEND A DOG
HimMjk-1rg4_14 0 CERTAINLY A SMALL BREED DOG WITH THE MINUTE YOUR BREED DOG IS NOT GOING TO NEED JOINT HEALTH SUPPLEMENTS AS MUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE HAIR ANOTHER ROT WHILE OR THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TODAY IS GOING TO NEED THAT
HimMjk-1rg4_16 0 IT ALL REALLY IS GOING TO DEPEND ON THE DOG AND YOU WANT TO WORK WITH YOUR VET AND YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR DOG TO KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR DOG TO BE EATING
gJBKLgcmnbo_1 0 OUR NEXT THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS ON THE GOLF SHAFT
gJBKLgcmnbo_2 0 WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT HERE IS YOUR BASIC GRAPHITE SHAFT
gJBKLgcmnbo_3 0 WHEN YOU FIND A LOT OF THESE IN YOUR WOODS VIBRATES THREE WOODS DRIVERS
gJBKLgcmnbo_4 0 YOU'RE STILL SHAFT
gJBKLgcmnbo_5 0 YOU'RE MOST STANDARD IRON WILL HAVE A STEEL SHAFT OFF
gJBKLgcmnbo_6 0 THE ONLY TIME I WOULD RECOMMEND A PUTTING A GRAPHITE SHAFT IN YOUR IRON I'VE WOULD BE FOR YOUR HIGH HANDICAP PLAYERS WHERE YOUR JUNIOR PLAYERS
gJBKLgcmnbo_7 0 THE WOMEN IN THE SCENE YEARS
gJBKLgcmnbo_8 0 THIS BEING YOU WANT TO MAKE THE CLUB IS LIGHT AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM
gJBKLgcmnbo_9 0 SO YOU WANT TO CREATE AS MUCH CLUB HEAD SPEED ON FOR THOSE HIGH HANDICAP PLAYERS WHO HAVE TROUBLE GET THE BALL UP IN THE AIR
gJBKLgcmnbo_10 0 AND YOU SHOULD KNOW I MEAN THE FAST THE CLUB IS SPEED THE EASIER IT IS TO GET THE BALL UP IN THE AIR
gJBKLgcmnbo_11 0 AND BASICALLY THE REASON BEHIND THAT IS YOUR PUTTING SPIN ON THE GOLF BALL
gJBKLgcmnbo_12 0 SO WITH THE STEEL SHAFT KNEE IRONS THEY COME IN DIFFERENT STIFFNESS
gJBKLgcmnbo_13 0 YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE RIGHT HERE THIS IS CALLED A PROJECT X RIFLE SHAFT
gJBKLgcmnbo_14 0 IT'S A SIX POINT FIVE IN BASICALLY THAT'S EXTRA STIFF
gJBKLgcmnbo_15 0 THESE GO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO FIVE POINT ZERO FIVE POINT FIVE AND SIX
gJBKLgcmnbo_16 0 BASICALLY THAT IS JUST THE DIFFERENCE IN THE STIFFNESS IN THE SHAFT ONE
gJBKLgcmnbo_17 0 YOU HAVE GOLF IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE MORE UNDER FIVE ZERO AND THIS IS THIS IS JUST MEASUREMENTS IN THE RIFLE SHAFT A SERIES
gJBKLgcmnbo_18 0 LIKE WE MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE GRAPHITE SHAFT IT THE WAY TO THE SHAFT RIGHT HERE
gJBKLgcmnbo_19 0 THAT'S THE EIGHTY FIVE GRAMS SHAFT EXTRA STIFF
gJBKLgcmnbo_20 0 SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES
gJBKLgcmnbo_21 0 YOU KNOW WHEN THE GRAPHITE SHAFT THE LIGHTER THE SHAFT IS PROBABLY FOR THAT SLOWER SPLIT
gJBKLgcmnbo_22 0 AND THIS IS JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO CREATE A FASHION SWING SPEED
gJBKLgcmnbo_23 0 BUT A LIGHTER SHAFT IN YOUR HANDS AND IT WILL CREATE THAT FASTER SWING SPEED
gJBKLgcmnbo_24 0 THE BIGGER STRONGER PLAYERS YOU WANT A HEAVIER SHAFT IN YOUR SWING A HEAVIER SO YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR SHAFT IN YOUR GOLF CLUB
gJBKLgcmnbo_25 0 THOSE ARE JUST PRETTY BASIC IDEAS AND IN THE THINGS YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IN THE GOLF SWING THE GOLF SHAFT
gJBKLgcmnbo_26 0 THE MAIN THING WITH THE SHAFT LIKE I SAID IS GOING TO BE THE STIFFNESS STIFFNESS IN THE WEIGHT
gJBKLgcmnbo_27 0 THE THE HEAVIER THE GOLF HAVE DIFFERENT TO THAT IS GOING TO BE
gJBKLgcmnbo_28 0 AND THAT'S ONE THING YOU WANT TO KEEP AN EYE UP
gJBKLgcmnbo_29 0 NEXT THING WE'RE GOING TO IS THE LENGTH OF THE CLUB
gJBKLgcmnbo_30 0 ANYWHERE FROM YOUR WAY IS TO YOUR DRIVERS WHICH LENGTH IS RIGHT FOR YOU
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_2 0 I WANT TO SORT OF TALK TO YOU ABOUT ANOTHER CARD PRINCIPAL AND THE SPENDING OLLIE DECK
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_3 0 NOW SOME OF THESE OTHER SEGMENTS HERE ON EXPERT VILLAGE OF TALK TO YOU ABOUT CARD FORCING

Gqq6FwTV-Nw_5 0 NOW I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO LEARN SOME METHODS OF FORCING CARDS THAT USE A REGULAR DECK

gbmk2SqTtDI_4 0 WHAT I HAVE HERE DISPLAYED ON THE HOOD IS A TYPICAL SUMMERTIME BLADE
gbmk2SqTtDI_5 0 WHAT I HAVE RIGHT BEHIND IT IS YOUR TYPICAL WINTERTIME PLAY
gbmk2SqTtDI_6 0 AS YOU CAN SEE THE WINTERTIME BLADE HAS A RUBBER SHEATH OVER ALL OF THE MOVING COMPONENTS INSIDE OF THE WIPER
gbmk2SqTtDI_7 0 THESE PIECES THAT THE SHEET THIS COVERING OUR EXAMPLE HERE
gbmk2SqTtDI_8 0 THESE ARE SPRINTS BUILT INSIDE OF IT TO ACTUALLY HOLD THE WIPER BLADE TIGHT TO YOUR WINDSHIELD
gbmk2SqTtDI_9 0 IF YOU NOTICE SIDE IN THE WINTERTIME DRIVE ALONG AND TRY AND USE YOUR WIPER BLADES THEY WILL TOUCH ALL OVER THE WINDSHIELD ITSELF
gbmk2SqTtDI_10 0 IT'LL ACTUALLY STREETS AND PORTIONS OF IT THAT ARE ON CLEAN
gbmk2SqTtDI_11 0 WHAT THAT IS FROM IS FROM ICE DEBRIS SNOW THINGS OF THAT NATURE GETTING INSIDE THE SPRINGS AND KEEPING THEM FROM CONTACTING YOUR WINDSHIELD
gbmk2SqTtDI_12 0 LET ME SHOW YOU THE SPRING ACTION HERE RIGHT THERE
gbmk2SqTtDI_13 0 WHAT THE RUBBER SHEATH DOES IS KEEP THOSE FORM PARTICLES FROM AFFECTING THE WAY THE MECHANICS OF THE WIPER BLADE HAS BEEN DESIGNED OPERATE
gbmk2SqTtDI_14 0 IT'S A GOOD IDEA IF YOU DO A LOT OF DRIVING THE WINTER TIME OR LEAVE THE WITH THE NORTHERN STATES TO GO AHEAD AND CHANGE OUT YOUR WIPER BLADES
gbmk2SqTtDI_15 0 NOW YOUR SUMMER BLADE MIGHT NOT BE WORN OUT
gbmk2SqTtDI_16 0 IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO JUST DISCONNECT YOUR SUMMER TIME BLADE PUT IT IN THE TRUNK OR IN YOUR GARAGE SOMEWHERE AND SAVE IT FOR LATER ON THE NEXT SUMMER ROLLS AROUND
gbmk2SqTtDI_17 0 BY SET OF THESE BY A SET OF THESE
gbmk2SqTtDI_18 0 THAT IS THE WAY THAT YOU OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE FROM YOUR WIPER BLADES AND IT WILL KEEP YOU SEEING GOOD THROUGHOUT THE WINTER

ggyQaBY9Mq8_2 0 NOW WE TALKED ABOUT RUBBER STAMPS BUT ANOTHER METHOD OF USING WAX TO COVER AN IMAGE IS WITH PHOTOGRAPHY
ggyQaBY9Mq8_3 0 A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE INTO PHOTOGRAPHY SO TO MIX WAX REALLY IS EXCITING FOR THEM
ggyQaBY9Mq8_4 0 HOW I STARTED WAS WITH A LITTLE IMAGE OF A MAN THAT WAS PERFORMING OVER IN VICTORIA ON THE STREET TOOK IS IMAGE HOME AND BECAUSE I'M IN A GALLERY WHERE WE HAVE TO HANG NEW WORK EVERY MONTH THIS IDEA CAME TO ME THE ABOUT USING PHOTOGRAPHY
ggyQaBY9Mq8_5 0 SO HERE I TOOK IS IMAGE I WENT TO A PRINT SHOP BY HAND PRINTED ON A PIECE OF SHINY CARD STOCK AND THEN I JUST BEGIN TO WAX ON TOP OF THE SURFACE
ggyQaBY9Mq8_6 0 I DID PUT CLEAR WAX DOWN FIRST JUST LIKE WITH RUBBER STAMPS BUT I GOT THIS IMAGE WHICH WAS THE FIRST ONE I TRIED AND IT BECAME VERY POPULAR
ggyQaBY9Mq8_7 0 AND ONCE YOU START SELLING SOMETHING YOU GO HEY THIS IS A GOOD IDEA
ggyQaBY9Mq8_8 0 I THINK I'LL DO SOME MORE SO ANOTHER METHOD THAT I DID WAS TO TAKE A PICTURE OF THE STEPS YOU HIT A GARDEN AND THEN I COVERED THAT WITH CLEAR WAX AND IN THIS CASE I PUT DOWN SOME TISSUE PAPER AND THEN I CAN SHOW THE THREADS OF THE TISSUE PAPER THROUGH THE WAX AND COLORED ON TOP OF THAT SURFACE TO CREATE THIS EFFECT WHEN IT HITS THE HAS AN INTERESTING TRANSITION FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH TO THE WAX COATING
ggyQaBY9Mq8_9 0 HERE WAS ANOTHER STATUE IN A GARDEN THAT I TOOK AND THEN DID SOME WAX ON TOP
ggyQaBY9Mq8_10 0 YOU SEE THE PHOTOGRAPH HANDS RIGHT HERE AND THEN THE WAX CREATES THIS INTERESTING ALLUSION
ggyQaBY9Mq8_11 0 NOW ONE TIME IN THE GALLERY THAT EVERYBODY WAS GOING TO DO LIFE DRAWINGS AND I THOUGHT WHAT IN THE WORLD CAN I DO
ggyQaBY9Mq8_12 0 SO I WENT AND DID SOME LIFE DRAWING CLASSES TO SEE WHAT I COULD COME UP WITH AND I TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE MODELS AND IN THIS CASE HERE I STARTED WITH THIS ONE ACTUALLY
ggyQaBY9Mq8_13 0 I TOOK THE WOMAN AND LIKE I PRINTED THE IMAGE NOT ON PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPER BUT ON SILK
ggyQaBY9Mq8_14 0 I USE SILK TRANSFER PAPER TO USE FOR THE PHOTOGRAPH CUT OUT THE SILK TOOK ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPH OF SOME FLOWERS CUT THOSE OUT AND CREATE A DRESS FOR HER HERE TAKE ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPH OF A STATUE OF THE FACE AND OBSCURE DID WITH THE WAX AND PUT THE WHOLE THING ON TOP OF AN ABSTRACT DESIGN THAT I DID ON FOR SMALL LITTLE CARDS CREATING THIS IMAGE OR COLDER RADIANT DANCER
ggyQaBY9Mq8_15 0 KIND OF LIKE THE WAY THAT TURNED OUT
ggyQaBY9Mq8_16 0 IN THIS CASE I TOOK THE MAN AND I HAD AN PRINTED ON SILK TEN I WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT TO DO WITH THEM AND I HAD SOME WAX ON A CARD THAT WAS LAYING ON THE TABLE WHEN I DRAPE THIS PIECE OF SILK ON TOP OF THAT I CAN SEE THROUGH TO THE WAX AND JUST BY HEATING THE TOP OF THE SURFACE THE WAX CAME THROUGH AND I CALL THEM TATTOO

g-C8KxKMpEQ_4 0 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE CONCEALER REALLY CONCEALS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO
g-C8KxKMpEQ_5 0 AND YOU ALSO DON'T WANT IT TO BLEND OFF OR SMUDGE OFF AFTER JUST A FEW MINUTES
g-C8KxKMpEQ_6 0 SINCE YOU'RE SPENDING MONEY ON A PRODUCT IT SHOULD REALLY WORK
g-C8KxKMpEQ_7 0 THERE ARE A GOOD TRICK IS AT THE CONCEALER REALLY COVERS UP IS TO IF YOU ARE IN THE STORE AND YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO TEST YOUR PRODUCT IS TO CHECK ON THE BACK OF YOUR HAND AND TRY TO COVER UP ON YOU KNOW ANY BLUE VEINS THAT YOU SEE THEY'RE USUALLY A LITTLE MORE VISIBLE ON ON FAIR SKIN PEOPLE

glmpBO0gR14_7 0 AND THEN YOU COULD ADD A PAIR OF GOLD HOOP EARRINGS
glmpBO0gR14_8 0 OR YOU COULD ADD SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT SIMPLER
glmpBO0gR14_9 0 JUST A LITTLE BLACK AND GOLD DROP
glmpBO0gR14_10 0 OR EVEN JUST A SIMPLE BLACK
glmpBO0gR14_11 0 AGAIN YOU CAN DO SOMETHING WITH A LITTLE MORE DRAMATIC FLARE
glmpBO0gR14_12 0 YOU COULD PUT THAT IN THE GOLD BRACELET
glmpBO0gR14_13 0 OR IF YOU WANT TO KEEP SOMETHING SIMPLE OR WITH THE BANGLE BRACELET
glmpBO0gR14_14 0 SEE THAT AGAIN THAT ALL WORKS TOGETHER
glmpBO0gR14_15 0 NOW PEARLS ARE ALSO A GREAT WAY TO GO AND I LOVE PEARLS
glmpBO0gR14_16 0 AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO LOOK LIKE OLD IN AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL OLD FASHIONED IN THEM
glmpBO0gR14_17 0 A LOT OF PEARLS OR IN THE LONG VERY VERY LONG
glmpBO0gR14_18 0 AND THAT CAN BE A LITTLE HARD TO WEAR SOMETIMES
glmpBO0gR14_19 0 ESPECIALLY FOR WORKING BUSINESS
glmpBO0gR14_20 0 THEY KNOCK AROUND IT TOO MUCH OF THE DESK
glmpBO0gR14_21 0 SO YOU CAN JUST EASILY DOUBLED OVER
glmpBO0gR14_22 0 NOW HERE'S ANOTHER LITTLE TRICK NOT TO FORGET
glmpBO0gR14_23 0 DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO STOP THERE WITH JUST PEARL NECKLACE
glmpBO0gR14_24 0 YOU STILL COULD ADD IN A SCARF
glmpBO0gR14_25 0 THAT'S STILL ARTFULLY TIED THEM JUST DOING THIS VERY QUICK THIS STILL WOULD WORK FOR YOU
glmpBO0gR14_26 0 AND JUST KEEP A LITTLE BIT MORE INTEREST GOING AROUND YOUR FACE
glmpBO0gR14_27 0 AND AGAIN IF YOU WERE IN A SIMPLE OUTFIT THAT SORT OF JUST KIND OF GIVES THAT SIMPLE OUTFIT A BIT OF PIZAZZ TO ADD THAT EXTRA SCARF IN THERE
glmpBO0gR14_29 0 A PEARL EARRING AND YOU'RE READY TO GO

glmpBO0gR14_31 0 IT COULD EVEN TAKE YOU INTO A A DINNER MEETING
glmpBO0gR14_32 0 SO THAT'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO WITH THE ACCESSORIES

H9xycKoSgHM_3 0 BUT ALL THE REST THEY NEED TO KNOW AND THAT MEANS YOU NEED TO GET INVITATIONS OUT PRONTO
H9xycKoSgHM_4 0 THERE ARE A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN DO THIS FIRST OFF YOU CAN SEND OUT TRADITIONAL NAILED INVITATIONS DISADVANTAGES WITH DISADVANTAGES WITH THIS IS THAT YOU HAVE TO NAIL AMOUNT THAT TAKES TIME
H9xycKoSgHM_5 0 IT TAKES LONGER FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK OPEN THEM IN RESPONSE TO THEM AND IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO SEND INVITATIONS OUT REALLY EARLY OTHERWISE IT'S GOING TO BE TOO LATE PEOPLE MAKE PLANES YOU'RE MORE THAN LIKELY GOING TO BE FACING COMPETITION
H9xycKoSgHM_6 0 IF YOU'RE TRYING TO HOLD A HALLOWEEN PARTY YOUR CLASS TO GET YOUR GET THE WORD OUT EARLY EARLY OCTOBER THREE TO FOUR WEEKS IN ADVANCE FOR A HALLOWEEN PARTY THIS TARGETED IT TEENS IS THE BEST WAY TO GO
H9xycKoSgHM_7 0 ANY EARLIER THAN THAT WILL FALL PEOPLE STILL CHARADE ARE THAT ANY LATER THAN THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS THE COMPETITION PEOPLE'S COUNTERS WE'RE ALREADY FILL UP
H9xycKoSgHM_8 0 THE OTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO PAPER INVITATIONS IS USING WEBSITES THERE ARE LOTS OF WEBSITES OUT THERE WHERE YOU CAN ALSO SET INVITATIONS
H9xycKoSgHM_9 0 LIVING IN AN ELECTRONIC WORLD NOW WE CAN CERTAINLY ASSET INVITATIONS THIS WAY AND YOUR SPONSOR IT'LL BE QUICKER REMINDERS WILL BE EASIER AND IN GENERAL FOR THE YOUNGER GENERATION THEY'RE GOING TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE PROBABLY WITHOUT THAT WITH A CARD

H2UbBPFSinc_8 0 THESE GUYS ATTACK THESE TWO GUYS ALRIGHT
H2UbBPFSinc_9 0 THESE GUYS EITHER MAKE THE SHOT OR THEY MISS THE SHOT
H2UbBPFSinc_10 0 THEY MISS THE SHOT THESE TWO GUYS ARE FLYING OUT GOING THE OTHER WAY AND THE FIRST GUY ON THIS SIDE COMES INTO JOINT
H2UbBPFSinc_11 0 SO NOW IT'S THE THREE GUYS FROM THE OTHER IN AGAINST THESE TWO GUYS
H2UbBPFSinc_13 0 WHEN THAT HAPPENS THESE TWO GUYS COME IN AND ESTABLISH YOUR DEFENSIVE POSITIONS
H2UbBPFSinc_14 0 THESE THREE GUYS ATTACK EITHER MAKE THE SHOT A MISSED SHOT
H2UbBPFSinc_15 0 THEY MAKE THE SHOT SO THE THESE TWO DEFENSIVE PLAYERS COME DOWN TO PLAY OFFENSE AND THE VERY NEXT GUYS IN LINE COMES DOWN TO JOIN THEM TO PLAY A THREE AND TWO AGAINST THESE GUYS

h6IQn8pgGeY_1 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE MAKING A CHICKEN DISH

he951qDdm2Y_1 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE MOMENT IN A HAND WHEN YOU REALIZE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN THIS HAND BARONETS
he951qDdm2Y_2 0 THE SITUATION IS THAT THE STOCK PILE IS THIN
he951qDdm2Y_3 0 REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS THICK WILL NOW IT'S THIN BECAUSE THE CARDS OF THE YOU'VE BEEN MOVE TO THE TABLEAU OR THEY HAVE BEEN MOVE OFF THE TABLEAU INTO THE FOUNDATION
he951qDdm2Y_4 0 BUT SOCK BOWS THEN THE TABLEAU HAS A GOOD NUMBER OF CARDS ON IT
he951qDdm2Y_5 0 AND WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT CARDS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE A COMBINATION ADDS UP TO THIRTEEN ARE LOCKED
he951qDdm2Y_6 0 AND HOW DOES A CARD BECOME LOCKS
he951qDdm2Y_7 0 WELL IT'S LIKE THIS
he951qDdm2Y_8 0 IF WE LOOK OVER HERE WHERE THIS QUEEN IS THE QUEEN NEEDS AN ACE
he951qDdm2Y_9 0 THE ACE NEEDS A QUEEN
he951qDdm2Y_10 0 BUT YOU CAN ONLY PLAY THE TOP CARD OF EACH PILE
he951qDdm2Y_11 0 SO THE FACT THAT THESE TWO ACES ARE BURIED BENEATH THIS QUEEN MEANS THAT THEY CAN BE PLAYED
he951qDdm2Y_12 0 AND I'M HOPING THAT ANOTHER ACE COMES OUT
he951qDdm2Y_13 0 BUT THEY'RE ONLY TO EITHER ACES LEFT RIGHT
he951qDdm2Y_14 0 THIS HAPPEN AGAIN WITH JACKSON TWOS CARDS ARE LOCKED UP
he951qDdm2Y_15 0 SO WHEN YOU SEE CARDS GET LOCKED UP LIKE THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TO HOPE FOR A LOW SCORE AND YOU'RE LIKELY NOT GOING TO WIN
HFOuxMS0nL4_1 0 NOW THAT WE'VE LAYERED RC SOLVENT EPSOM SALT WE'VE GOT THE PINK COLOR THAT'S THE ROWS SCENTED AND THE WHITE WHICH IS THE VANILLA SCENTED WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUR LID ON OUR JAR AND WE'RE GOING TO SPRAY SIT UP WITH SOME CURLING RIBBON
HFOuxMS0nL4_2 0 I'VE GOT SOME WHITE HERE AND I'VE GOT SOME BREAD AND I'M JUST GOING TO TIE THIS RIGHT HERE TO FLOW
HFOuxMS0nL4_3 0 BETTER MOVE MY OIL OUT OF THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A ROSE AND VANILLA EXPLOSION IN HERE
HFOuxMS0nL4_4 0 THERE WE GO
HFOuxMS0nL4_5 0 TIE THIS BOAT JUST LIKE THIS AND BECAUSE IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY WE CAN JUST HAVE A WHITE WE ALSO HAVE GOT TO GET SOME RED IN THERE AND THIS IS A GREAT GIFT
HFOuxMS0nL4_6 0 IT IS INEXPENSIVE IT'S EASY TO MAKE IT'S FUN IT SMELLS GREAT AND BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING FOR FRIEND THAT EXPRESS IS THAT YOU WANT THEM TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES THEY KNOW THAT YOU CARE ABOUT THAT IN AND THEY'RE REALLY IS NO BETTER GIFT THAN THAT
HFOuxMS0nL4_7 0 OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR SCISSORS AND WE'RE SIMPLY GOING TO CURL THE ENDS OF OUR RIBBON
HFOuxMS0nL4_8 0 MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE FESTIVE OR JUST LIKE THAT
HAjdqjbepjc_1 0 NOW SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO OR SHOULD DO A IN A LARGE CLASSROOM IS ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION
HAjdqjbepjc_2 0 WELL HOW DO YOU ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION
HAjdqjbepjc_3 0 THAT SOMETIMES DIFFICULT
HAjdqjbepjc_4 0 THE FIRST THING THAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS CREATE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT BY CREATING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT IS MAKE STUDENTS FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT WHAT THEY HAVE TO ADD TO A DISCUSSION WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY IN CLASS MATTERS AND THAT IT'S NOT JUST STUPID OR THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE MADE FUN UP OR THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE CALLED DOWN FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION FOR THE COMMENTS THAT THEY MAKE
HAjdqjbepjc_5 0 ANOTHER THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO PRACTICE ENTHUSIASM
HAjdqjbepjc_6 0 IF YOU ARE IN THE ZS STICK ABOUT YOUR SUBJECT THEN YOUR STUDENTS WILL GET ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT AND THEY WILL WANT TO PARTICIPATE MORE
HAjdqjbepjc_7 0 YOU CAN ALSO PLANNED PARTICIPATION ACTIVITIES
HAjdqjbepjc_8 0 OKAY ON FRIDAY WE'RE ALL GOING TO GO AROUND THE ROOM AND WE'RE GOING TO TELL ALL WHATEVER IT IS WE'RE GOING TO TELL SO THAT THE STUDENTS HAVE TIME TO PLAN BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE PARTICIPATING
HAjdqjbepjc_9 0 YOU CAN CALL ON STUDENTS RATHER THAN WAITING FOR THEM TO VOLUNTEER
HAjdqjbepjc_10 0 IF YOU'RE NOT REALLY HAVING ANY PARTICIPATION IN YOUR CLASSROOM CUT THIS IS ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU WANT TO LEARN THEIR NAMES
HAjdqjbepjc_11 0 CALL ON THEM NOT CALL THEM OUT BUT CALL ON THEM TO SEE WHAT THEY HAVE TO ADD TO THE CONVERSATION
HAjdqjbepjc_12 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE A QUESTION BOX WHAT YOU NOTICED WHERE STUDENTS COULD WRITE DOWN QUESTIONS RIGHT DOWN THOUGHTS AND THEN YOU CAN READ THEM ALL OUT IN FRONT OF THE CLASS AND THAT COULD ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION
HAjdqjbepjc_13 0 YOU COULD READ ANONYMOUSLY WORK SUBMITTED BY STUDENTS AND THAT CAN SOMETIMES GENERATE PARTICIPATION IN THE CLASSROOM BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE ON WITH THIS INCREASING THAT SENSE OF COMMUNITY THAT YOU ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION YOUR CLASS REGARDLESS OF THE SIDES
gji7EfzB92Y_1 0 OKAY LET'S START BY MARKING OFF WHERE WE WANT TO PLACE OUR BEADS
gji7EfzB92Y_2 0 I WANT TO PLACE MY BEADS AT ONE INCH INTERVALS ALONG THE EDGE AND I'M GOING TO JUST TAKE PINS
gji7EfzB92Y_3 0 I'M NOT GOING TO MARK THE CORNER THAT'S THE BEGINNING AND WE KNOW WHERE THAT IS AND JUST TAKE PINS
gji7EfzB92Y_4 0 PUT A PUT YOUR RULER ALONG THE EDGE OF THE FABRIC AND JUST STICK IN THE PINS GENTLY JUST A LITTLE BIT JUST ENOUGH TO TO MARK THE PLACE ONE IN ONE INCH INTERVALS AND GO ALL THE WAY DOWN
gji7EfzB92Y_5 0 NOW YOU CAN MAKE YOUR BEADS CLOSER IT
gji7EfzB92Y_6 0 IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU LIKE TO DO BUT FOR THIS PROJECT ONE INCH IS THE IS GOOD AND GO ALL THE WAY DOWN ONE EDGE THERE
gji7EfzB92Y_7 0 NOW YOU CAN ALSO MARK YOUR WORK WITH THE OF FABRIC PEN THAT IS WASHABLE ON BUT I PREFER TO USE THE PINS BECAUSE THEN I DON'T HAVE TO WASH THE PROJECT AFTER
gji7EfzB92Y_8 0 NOW AS YOU CAN SEE MY NAPKIN ISN'T EXACTLY GIVING ME AN INCH TO THE END SO I AM GOING TO JUST NOT TO AN INCH BUT JUST KIND OF THE EYE EACH ONE A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PRECISE UNTIL IT LOOKS NICE
gji7EfzB92Y_9 0 WITH THIS ONE A LITTLE BIT OVER
gji7EfzB92Y_10 0 YOU CAN ALSO MEASURE THE MEASURE THE PROJECT AND DO SOME SIMPLE DIVISIONS
gji7EfzB92Y_11 0 FIND OUT WHAT THE EXACT INTERVAL SHOULD BE BUT NOT IF FOR THIS PROJECT JUST BUYING IT IS GOING TO WORK OKAY
HjvJlOmFebE_1 0 HI I'M NANCY FRENSLEY THE BERKELEY EAST BAY HUMANE SOCIETY I'M THE TRAINING MANAGER
HjvJlOmFebE_2 0 AND THIS IS MY FRIENDS LOLLY WHO IS MY DOG SHE'S A MUST WRITING SHEPARD AND SHE'S GOING TO HELP ME TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE AMERICAN PIT BOLT CARRIER
HjvJlOmFebE_3 0 SHE HAS A LOT OF FRIENDS WHO ARE AMERICAN PICKLED CARRIERS AND I HAVE BECOME ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR BREEDS SIMPLY BY FOLD THAT WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY
HjvJlOmFebE_4 0 AND PART OF THAT IS THAT THEY HAVE A VERY SAD HERITAGE HAVING COME FROM THE FIGHTING KITSON BEEN BRED BREAD BREAD BREAD UNTIL THEY ARE SO MANY OF THEM THAT IF YOU GO INTO A MUNICIPAL SHELTER IN A CITY YOU'LL SEE MOSTLY AMERICAN DIBBLED CARRIERS
HjvJlOmFebE_5 0 THEY MAKE REALLY GREAT PETS WITH A COUPLE OF OPTIONS
HjvJlOmFebE_6 0 YOU COULDN'T ASK FOR A DOG THAT WOULD BE BETTER WITH PEOPLE WOULD BE BETTER WITH YOU WITH YOUR FAMILY BUT THEY HAVE TO BE SOCIALIZE FROM THE VERY EARLY AGE AND FROM A VERY EARLY AGE SOCIALIZE WITH OTHER DOGS
HjvJlOmFebE_7 0 YOUR BACK VERY COMFORTABLE TERRIER MIGHT NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR HERITAGE BE ABLE TO READ THE SIGNALS OTHER DOGS ARE KNOW WHEN TO STOP AND THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE PLAYING WITH OTHER DOGS WHEN THEY ARE INCLINED TO GET INTO TROUBLE
HjvJlOmFebE_8 0 SO YOUR AMERICAN GENTLE INTERIOR WILL NEED ALL THE STANDARD THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF A DOG VETERINARY CARE THEY NEED GOOD COAT CARE THEY NEED A GOOD DIET THEY NEED ANOTHER EXERCISE TO REALLY WHERE THE ALPHABET AND THEY NEED GOOD MENTAL EXERCISE TO KEEP THEM INSIDE THEMSELVES OF SPACE BECAUSE THEY GET EXCITED REALLY FAST AND GO OUT OF CONTROL REALLY FAST
HjvJlOmFebE_9 0 BUT IF YOU START FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WITH YOUR WITH YOUR AMERICAN THE BOLT CARRIER OF PUTTING BOUNDARIES ON THEM LETTING THEM KNOW HOW FAR THEY CAN GO STOPPING THEM WHEN YOU'RE READY TO STOP THEM AND ALWAYS REWARDING THEM FOR THE GOOD THINGS THAT THEY DO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT LIFE WITH YOUR AMERICAN PIMPLES HERE

hAPx94Mt964_3 0 IT'S ACTUALLY THE POSITION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE GOING INTO
hAPx94Mt964_4 0 SO WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF THE DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT ROLL A DIFFERENT MINDSET WHEN WE'RE DOING SELF DEFENSE TECHNIQUES
hAPx94Mt964_5 0 WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT POSITIONS AND WE ARE ABOUT THE STRIKES
hAPx94Mt964_6 0 SO FIRST OFF BEFORE YOU GET STARTED WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT SAFETY AGAIN
hAPx94Mt964_7 0 PRACTICE ALL THESE TECHNIQUES NICE AND SLOW
hAPx94Mt964_8 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET SOMEBODY THAT YOU KNOW IS COMP THE COPPING TRAINING PARTNER THAT IS NOT GOING TO FREAK OUT ON THE THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE FLINCHING AND EVERY TIME YOU THROW STRIKE
hAPx94Mt964_9 0 WITH SOMEONE THAT IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU

hAPx94Mt964_16 0 YOU WANT TO JUST ARE NICE AND SLOW TO MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT EVERY TECHNIQUE CAN BE EXECUTED

HCoR8_tnEd4_1 0 HI ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS I MASS BY PATIENCE IS WHAT I DO NOW THAT I'VE MADE AN APPOINTMENT
HCoR8_tnEd4_2 0 SO YOU FOUND THAT ACUPUNCTURIST YOU WANT TO GO TO FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU GET A FEW THINGS TOGETHER AND YOU'RE PREPARED FOR THAT FIRST TREATMENT SO THAT YOU GET THE GREATEST BENEFIT AND SUCCESS FROM THAT TREATMENT
HCoR8_tnEd4_3 0 SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I ALWAYS RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE IS TOGETHER TOGETHER THE PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY ANY SUPPLEMENTS THEY'RE TAKING
HCoR8_tnEd4_4 0 IF YOU'RE ALREADY TAKEN ANY HERBS OR VITAMINS MAKE SURE YOU BRING THEM WITH YOU TO THE PRACTITIONER
HCoR8_tnEd4_5 0 BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'VE GOT A QUALITY CONTROL CHECKED GOING ON AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKELY TO PRESCRIBE SOME SUPPLEMENTATION FOR YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO INTERFERE WITH ANY TO SUPPLEMENT YOUR CURRENTLY TAKING
HCoR8_tnEd4_6 0 OFTEN TIMES YOU DO HAVE TO DISROBE DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF TREATMENT
HCoR8_tnEd4_7 0 SO IF YOU'RE ON COMFORTABLE WITH THAT ALL MAKE SURE THAT YOU WEAR SOME VERY LOOSE CLOTHING THAT CAN BE MOVED SO THAT THEY CAN GET TO THE AREAS FOR ACUPUNCTURE
HCoR8_tnEd4_8 0 MANY ACUPUNCTURE TREATMENT FOCUS ON AREAS BELOW THE ELBOW AND BELOW THE KNEES
HCoR8_tnEd4_9 0 SO IF YOU'RE ABLE TO ROLL UP YOUR PANT LEG OR PUSH UP YOUR SLEEVES WILL BE MUCH EASIER FOR THE ACUPUNCTURE IS TO GET TO THAT AREA
HCoR8_tnEd4_10 0 IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO AVOID ANY COLORED LIQUIDS A FEW HOURS BEFORE YOUR TREATMENT
HCoR8_tnEd4_11 0 YOUR PRACTITIONER WILL BE LOOKING AT YOUR TONGUE TO SEE WHETHER THERE'S ANY CHANGES IN THAT
HCoR8_tnEd4_12 0 SO IF YOU HAD COFFEE YOUR TEA BEFORE YOUR TREATMENT YOU MIGHT FULL THEM BY HAVING A YELLOW OR COATING ON YOUR TONGUE
HCoR8_tnEd4_13 0 IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO EAT SOME FOOD BEFORE YOU GO BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE HUNGARY AND ANXIOUS BEFORE YOU GO
HCoR8_tnEd4_14 0 SO MAKE SURE THAT YOU EAT A NORMAL MEAL SOMETHING THAT'S NOT TOO FULL AND NOT RIGHT BEFORE YOU WALK IN
HCoR8_tnEd4_15 0 SO THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO ENJOY YOUR TREATMENT AND GET THE MOST BENEFIT OUT OF IT
HCoR8_tnEd4_16 0 MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO RELAX AND HAVE A GOOD TIME AND PROVIDE THE PRACTITIONER WITH LOTS OF DETAIL IN INFORMATION SO THEY CAN GIVE YOU THE FASTEST AND BEST PROGRESS THAT CAN BE HAND FROM THE TREATMENTS
GEhU3uPHqIs_1 0 THIS IS SEAN FROM EXPERT VILLAGE
GEhU3uPHqIs_2 0 WHEN YOU'RE GETTING READY TO A ONE EIGHTY OVER A SPINE THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO IT
GEhU3uPHqIs_3 0 YOU CAN EITHER FLY UP DO A COMPLETE ONE EIGHTY AND COME DOWN BACKWARDS OR REALLY EASY WAY WHICH IS THE ONE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IS TO JUST HAVE YOUR FRONT TIRE ON AND THEN GO BACKWARDS OVER IT
GEhU3uPHqIs_4 0 THE REASON THAT ONE IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE BETTER FOR YOU WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN THE OVER TO PICK THE FAKIE IS BECAUSE IT WILL GET YOU USE TO HITTING YOUR TIRE ON THE FRONT OR YOUR PACK ARE YOUR PEG ON THE A ON THE SPINE AND THEN GOING TO FAKIE
GEhU3uPHqIs_5 0 SO TO BE A GOOD WAY FOR YOU TO LEARN FOR THINGS THAT WANTS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS GO FAST ENOUGH TO GET UP ON THE FRONT TIRE AND USING A LITTLE BIT OF PRECISION HE GOT TO BE CONFIDENT
GEhU3uPHqIs_6 0 BE ABLE TO HIT YOUR TIRE BETWEEN THE TWO COPING TO THE SPINE BUT YOU WANT TO DO IS PLACE YOUR TIRE RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN THE TWO CUPPING STYLE YOU KIND OF GET LOCKED AND YOU DON'T SLIP AROUND
GEhU3uPHqIs_7 0 THEN WHAT YOUR WEIGHT IN YOUR MOMENTUM CARRY YOUR BACK OVER AND YOU'LL GO FAKIE DOWN THE OTHER SIDE THAT'S FOR YOUR FAKIE SKILLS COME INTO PLAY
GEhU3uPHqIs_8 0 SO WHEN YOU DROP IN GO OVER ACROSS THE SPINE AND THEN COME DOWN PLACE YOUR TIRE JUST RIGHT NOW WE'RE READY TO TRAP AND GIVE IT A TRY

-gwTchCnaQg_2 0 YOU CAN BE USING THE SAME ENGAGEMENT THAT WE LEARNED BEFORE
-gwTchCnaQg_3 0 WE DO A BIG INHALE THROUGH THE RIBS EXHALE RIBS GO DOWN
-gwTchCnaQg_4 0 YOU CAN EXTEND ONE ARM HERE I'M DOING MY RIGHT ARM AND THE RIBS ARE GOING TO EXPAND AND LIFT TO THE RIGHT SIDE AS IF I HAVE AN APPLE NEUTRINO REACHING TO PICK IT
-gwTchCnaQg_5 0 I EXPAND A LITTLE MORE AND I START PUSHING OFF WITH THE LEFT FOOT AS I START PUSHING OFF OF THE LEFT FOOT I'M GOING TO REACH A LITTLE FURTHER
-gwTchCnaQg_6 0 THE APPLES A LITTLE FURTHER AWAY

H1-j6LC90bg_1 0 SO EACH DIE EACH ONE OF THE ONE OF THE DICE IN THE GAME OF TRAINING IS SIX SIDED AND THERE ARE SIX DICE
H1-j6LC90bg_2 0 NOW I TALKED ABOUT HOW EACH ONE ON EACH SIDE HAS A PARTICULAR PART OF A TRAIN ON IT
H1-j6LC90bg_3 0 EACH SIDE OF THE DICE HAS A PARTICULARLY NUMBER ON IT TO A CORRESPONDING NUMBER
H1-j6LC90bg_4 0 AND THESE ARE POINT STUDIES
H1-j6LC90bg_5 0 THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS GAME IS THAT NUMBER SIX AND FIVE DO NOT ACTUALLY SCORE POINTS
H1-j6LC90bg_6 0 BUT THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN NUMBERS TO EXPLAIN WHERE THEY GO IN THE SEQUENCE
H1-j6LC90bg_7 0 SIX IS THE ENGINE THE HEAD OF THE TRAIN
H1-j6LC90bg_8 0 FIVE IS THE COAL TENDER WHICH ALWAYS GOES WITH AN ENGINE
H1-j6LC90bg_9 0 AND THEN FOR IS ONE OF THE CARGO CARS AND THIS IS WORTH POINTS
H1-j6LC90bg_10 0 YOU KNOW IT THAT ONCE THE COLORS GET INVOLVED INSTEAD OF BLACK AND WHITE DICE WE HAVE COLORS
H1-j6LC90bg_11 0 IF IT'S GOT A COLOR ON THE SIDE THEN IT'S CHORDS POINTS
H1-j6LC90bg_12 0 SO THERE'S FOUR POINTS
H1-j6LC90bg_13 0 THERE IS THREE TWO AND THEN THE CABOOSE IS WORTH ONE
H1-j6LC90bg_14 0 THE CABOOSE KIND OF NEAT BECAUSE IT ALSO IF YOU'RE ABLE TO PUT A CABOOSE ON YOUR TRAIN YOU DOUBLE YOUR SCORE
H1-j6LC90bg_15 0 SO THOSE ARE THE POINTS VALUES FOR THE TRAIN DICE
gzqhbD2DJZE_1 0 IN THIS SECTION WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LOWER BODY MECHANICS AS YOU'RE APPROACHING A FIVE LOW ON A HANDRAIL FEATURE
gzqhbD2DJZE_2 0 REMEMBER YOU'RE APPROACHING FROM YOUR HEELSIDE THIS TIME ALSO SO IT'S GOING TO BE BLIND
gzqhbD2DJZE_3 0 YOUR HEELS ARE GOING TO BE TOWARDS THE RAIL YOUR TOES ARE POINTING AWAY
gzqhbD2DJZE_4 0 KEEP YOUR KNEES BENT AND EQUAL WAY DISTRIBUTE ON EACH KNEE
gzqhbD2DJZE_5 0 AS YOU APPROACH THE LIP BE SURE TO SPRING LOVE THAT TAIL AND POP YOUR OLLIE
gzqhbD2DJZE_6 0 ONCE YOU POP YOUR OLLIE YOUR SHOULDERS WHERE THE CENTER UP OVER THE RAIL
gzqhbD2DJZE_7 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOUR BACK KNEE IS BENT AND YOUR WEIGHT IS DISTRIBUTE IT OVER YOUR BACK LEG AND YOUR FRONT KNEE IS A LITTLE BIT STRAIGHTENED OUT
gzqhbD2DJZE_8 0 ONCE YOU FEEL THE PRESS IT PLAYS YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO PULL THAT FRONT FOOT UP
gzqhbD2DJZE_9 0 NOT WITH TOO MUCH PRESSURE JUST GIVE IT A LITTLE TOE
gzqhbD2DJZE_10 0 KEEP YOUR SHOULDERS ALIGNED AND YOUR KNEES AND YOUR BACK KNEE BENT
gzqhbD2DJZE_11 0 KEEP YOUR EYES AT THE END OF THE RAIL AND PRESS THAT OUT
gzqhbD2DJZE_12 0 KEEP YOUR KNEES BENT AS YOU APPROACH
gzqhbD2DJZE_13 0 WE POP THE OLLIE YOUR SHOULDERS WOULD POSITION THEMSELVES OVER THE RAIL JUST LIKE THAT EXCEPT YOU HAVE YOUR BOARD ON
gzqhbD2DJZE_14 0 AND THAT'S THE LOWER BODY MECHANICS OF APPROACHING A HEELSIDE FIVE GO ON A HANDRAIL
gzqhbD2DJZE_15 0 JUST GET OUT THERE AND TRY IT
hifdta-XVPk_1 0 NOW THIS IS HOW I DID IT
hifdta-XVPk_2 0 A RECEIPT MY DEGREE CREATIVE ARTS WITH AN EMPHASIS EMOTION PICTURE PRODUCTION
hifdta-XVPk_3 0 MY FIRST JOB WAS WITH A LOCAL TV STATION SAN ANTONIO TEXAS
hifdta-XVPk_4 0 AND THOSE DAYS WE SHOT FILM NOT VIDEO
hifdta-XVPk_5 0 FROM THERE I WAS ABLE TO GET A JOB AS A FILMMAKER IN A PREVIOUS STATION IN A TOP TO MARKET PRODUCING AND SHOOTING DOCUMENTARIES
hifdta-XVPk_6 0 ONE SEVERAL MAJOR AWARDS FOR MY WORK WHICH ENABLE BE TO GET A JOB AS THE HEAD OF A DOCUMENTARY FILM UNIT FOR BELL HELICOPTER INTERNATIONAL AND TO RUN AROUND
hifdta-XVPk_7 0 I CONTACTED INTERNATIONAL NEWS ORGANIZATIONS OF WANTED TO LET THEM KNOW THAT I WAS AVAILABLE FOR FREE LANCE WORKING AROUND
hifdta-XVPk_8 0 I ALSO CONTACTED INTERNATIONAL NEWS ORGANIZATIONS WITH OFFICES INTO WRONG
hifdta-XVPk_9 0 IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP CLOSE CONTACT WITH THESE PEOPLE AS THEY WILL BECOME GOOD CONTACTS FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
hcBNNxoA9lQ_1 0 ALRIGHT ONCE THE BEANS GOTTEN CHANCE TO HEAT UP THE SCHOOL THIS I'M GOING TO PUT IT IN THE CENTER OF THE PLAY THAT FIRST AND THEN I'M GOING TO MOVE IT AROUND TO THE EDGE
hcBNNxoA9lQ_2 0 NOW I'M DOING THIS FOR TWO REASONS
hcBNNxoA9lQ_3 0 ONE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THE RICE TO GET LOST
hcBNNxoA9lQ_4 0 I WANT IT TO KEEP ITS OWN INDIVIDUAL FLAVOR BUT ALSO IT'S VERY COLORFUL
hcBNNxoA9lQ_5 0 SO I WANT THAT RICE TO NOTICE AS WELL AND THE SECOND REASON THAT I SEE BUILDING A LITTLE THEM HERE BECAUSE OUR RED DO IS SEW MOIST FOR THAT I WANT THIS TO HOLD THE JUICE IN WITH THE PLATE
hcBNNxoA9lQ_6 0 SO I'M GOING TO COME IN AND OUT AND MAKE SURE THAT I SCOOP OUT SOME CHICKEN AND SOME TREE SO AS WELL AS CARROTS AND TOMATOES AND I'M GOING TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF ALL ON TOP SO WE CAN SEE SOME TREE SO SOME ORANGE FROM THE CARROTS SOME WHITE FROM THE CHICKEN AND THEN I'LL COME BACK WITH OUR JUICE AND POUR THAT OVER THE TOP IT OFF AND SO HERE WE HAVE OUR CORN OIL AND RED BEAN RICE WITH OUR CHICKEN AND SAUSAGE RAGU
GRbQNAIOI80_1 0 THE NEXT THING WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH IS THE INTONATION ON THIS PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT
GRbQNAIOI80_2 0 AND WE WILL HAVE TO USE A CRIME ATTIC TO HERE
GRbQNAIOI80_3 0 OR YOU CAN USE A STROBE TUNER OF SOME KIND OF IN ORDER TO GET AN ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF WHETHER OR NOT THE PITCH OF AN OPEN STRING AND THE PITCH AT THE TWELFTH HARMONIC AT THE OCTAVE IS THE SAME
GRbQNAIOI80_4 0 AND WHETHER THAT PITCH SHIFTS WHEN WE PRESS THE STRING DOWN AND STRETCH IT
GRbQNAIOI80_5 0 SO THAT'S WHAT INTONATIONS ALL ABOUT
GRbQNAIOI80_6 0 AND THE WAY TO ADJUST THAT INTONATION IS WE MAY HAVE TO ADJUST THE CROWN OF THE SADDLE
GRbQNAIOI80_7 0 WE MIGHT HAVE TO ADJUST THE ANGLE OF THE SADDLE
GRbQNAIOI80_8 0 OR IF YOU LOOK ON THIS INSTRUMENT YOU CAN SEE THEY HAVE BUILT IN SOME INTONATION BUT EVEN SHIFTING IN WHERE THE CROWN OF THAT SADDLE EXISTS ON THE E STRING
GRbQNAIOI80_9 0 IT'S ON THIS AND THEN ON THE B STRING IT'S ON THIS END
GRbQNAIOI80_10 0 SO IT'S ADJUSTING THE DISTANCE FOR THE LENGTH OF THE STRING WITH SADDLE ADJUSTMENTS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PITCH OF THOSE THREE THINGS OPEN THE OCTAVE HARMONIC AND PLAYED NOTE ARE ALL EXACTLY THE SAME
g8ujePz4CCg_1 0 NOW WHAT'S NEXT IS THE PEAK LUBED THE PINK
g8ujePz4CCg_2 0 BELLY THE BASIN WHICH TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT WHAT'S GOING TO PEAK IN YOUR SONG BASICALLY WHAT'S CLIPPING WHAT'S OVER THE THRESHOLDS ZERO
g8ujePz4CCg_3 0 NOW WHEN USING THE CONTROL TWENTY FOUR YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT THE THERE'S METERS AT THE VERY TOP
g8ujePz4CCg_4 0 WHAT HAPPENS IS IS A VERY THERE'S A RED MEAT OR AT THE VERY TOP WHATEVER THIS GETS HIT IT STAYS ON
g8ujePz4CCg_5 0 YOU COULD ALSO CLEAR BY PRESSING IS CLEAR PEAKS BUTTON ON THE LEFT SIDE
g8ujePz4CCg_6 0 NOW WHEN YOU HAVE THIS BUTTON RIGHT HERE WE CLEAR IT IS GOING TO GET RID OF IT
g8ujePz4CCg_7 0 AS SOON AS IT PICKS UP AGAIN IT'S GOING TO SHOW THAT YOU'VE SEEN THIS IS THE STORE AND SO DON'T YOU DON'T REALLY WANT ANYTHING TO THE STORE
g8ujePz4CCg_8 0 IT ALSO WILL SHOW YOU RIGHT HERE WITHIN YOUR INPUT AND YOUR MY SO WHEN YOU'RE RECORDING SOMETHING AND YOU CHOOSE TO TURN ON YOUR MIND GRAIN
g8ujePz4CCg_9 0 BY HITTING THE SOURCE BUTTON YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T PEAK ON THE WING IN AND IT'S NOT PEAKING AFTER AS WELL
g8ujePz4CCg_10 0 SO WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS THIS PEAK DOESN'T GO ON AND THESE NEVER WE DRAGON
g8e9FZQWkMM_1 0 WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR VEGETABLE STOCK TO GET UP WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TURN UP OUR BACK BURNER UP TO ABOUT EIGHT
g8e9FZQWkMM_2 0 BUT IT IS GOING TO POUR A TABLESPOON OF OIL IT IN OUR LARGE POT IS WILL MOVE OR OR ROUND SO THAT COVERS ALL OF THE BOTTOM OF OUR POT
g8e9FZQWkMM_3 0 WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR THAT TO HEAT WE COME BACK TO OUR VEGETABLE STOCK
g8e9FZQWkMM_4 0 THEY'RE STILL BITS I CAN SEE THEM FLOATING AROUND IN THERE AND WE WANT TO BREAK THOSE UP WHICH IT AS MUCH AS WE CAN
g8e9FZQWkMM_5 0 ALRIGHT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR HALF A CUP OF RICE AND WE'RE GOING TO FILL THEM DOWN HERE IN THE BOTTOM OF OUR PAN
g8e9FZQWkMM_6 0 YOU CAN JUST SMOOTH IT AROUND SO THAT IS EQUAL OVER THE BOTTOM
g8e9FZQWkMM_7 0 AND ONCE OUR VEGETABLE STOCK TOP IT'S GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MEASURE OUT ONE CUP AND POUR IT IN WITH OUR RICE
g8e9FZQWkMM_8 0 WE'RE JUST GOING TO A BOIL WE'RE GOING TO PUT ON TOP AND REDUCE OUR HEAT DOWN TO FOUR AND LET IT COOK UNTIL THE VEGETABLE STOCK IS JUST ABOUT ALL EVAPORATED
H0-wO7ShPGw_1 0 HEY I'M BOBBY LAREW HERE AND EXPERT ON DIVING IS KICKED OUT OF OUR DIVER BOUNCE IT TO ENTER THE WATER WHAT DO WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF SPLASHED GOING ON
H0-wO7ShPGw_2 0 WHAT DO WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HITTING VERTICAL
H0-wO7ShPGw_3 0 WHAT WE DO TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A GOOD BODY LINE
H0-wO7ShPGw_4 0 IF YOU'RE COMPETITIVE DIVER WHAT DO YOU GOT TO DO TO MAKE SURE YOU GET THE HIGHEST FOR POSSIBLE
H0-wO7ShPGw_5 0 OKAY SO HOW DO WE ENTER THE WATER
H0-wO7ShPGw_6 0 THAT'S WHY I WANT TO TEACH YOU RIGHT NOW OKAY I'M TO GET BACK DOWN THE GROUND FOR YOU
H0-wO7ShPGw_7 0 IF THE KICK THAT ARE DIVE WHEN YOU'RE EVERY WATER FEET SHOULD BE WHEN IT AS FAR DOWN AS POSSIBLE ALMOST AS IF YOU'RE TRYING TO CURL YOUR TOES UNDERNEATH ALRIGHT KNEES ARE TOGETHER LOCKED OUT STRAIGHT OKAY
H0-wO7ShPGw_8 0 THERE SHOULD BE NO VISIBLE ARCH IN YOUR BODY OKAY WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW IS ARCHING SPEED NO VISIBLE ARCH IN YOUR BODY WHEN YOU'RE ENTERING THE WATER
H0-wO7ShPGw_9 0 THE TRICK TO DO THAT IS TO THINK ABOUT TAKING YOUR BELLY BUTTON AND TRYING TO SUCK IT THROUGH YOUR BODY TO YOUR BACK
H0-wO7ShPGw_10 0 THAT WILL HELP KEEP YOUR BACK STRAIGHT
H0-wO7ShPGw_11 0 ANOTHER THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO TAKE YOUR HIPS AND ROLL THEM UP A LITTLE BIT OKAY UPPER BODY ARMS EXTENDED OF YOUR HAND PET HANDS TOGETHER EYES LOOKING AT THE HAND
H0-wO7ShPGw_12 0 THIS IS THE PROPER WAY TO ENTER THE WATER
Gkjo_HGLNs4_1 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BANK SHOTS
Gkjo_HGLNs4_2 0 BANK SHOTS ARE NOT ONLY PRETTY BUT THEY'RE EFFECTIVE AND THEY'RE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE SHOT WHEN YOU USE THEM PROPERLY THEN JUST SHOOTING THE BALL AROUND ON
Gkjo_HGLNs4_3 0 AND THAT'S WHY THEY PUT THE THE WHITE LINES UP THERE
Gkjo_HGLNs4_4 0 TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO AIM AT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_5 0 THEY'RE NOT UP THERE BY ACCIDENT THERE THERE FOR A REASON
Gkjo_HGLNs4_6 0 IT'S ALMOST TO BE LIKE IN THE POOL YOU KNOW IT'S ALL TRAJECTORY IN GEOMETRY
Gkjo_HGLNs4_7 0 AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO UNDERSTAND AND THAT YOU JUST HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE BALL WHEN YOU'RE IN A CERTAIN POSITION AND YOU PUT THE BALL UP THEIR OFF OF THE GLASS IT'S GOING OFF A COME IN AND BOUNCE INTO THE TO THE RIM NOW TURN THERE'S MANY
Gkjo_HGLNs4_8 0 THAT'S THE BENEFIT OF USING A GLASS SHOT BACKWARD SHOT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_9 0 YOU CAN USE IT FROM ALMOST ANYWHERE ON THE FLOOR
Gkjo_HGLNs4_10 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IF YOU'RE OUTSIDE OF THE LANE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE LANE WHEN YOU'RE UP MORE TOWARDS THE FRONT OF OF THE KEY OF TOWARDS UP HERE YOU DON'T WANT TO USE THE BACKWARDS SHOT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_11 0 THOSE ARE CALLED BANK SHOTS OFF OF THE FRONT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_12 0 YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO REALLY USE THAT IT'S IT'S NOT AS EFFECTIVE
Gkjo_HGLNs4_13 0 IT'S REALLY MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN YOU'RE USING IT ON THE SIDE OF THE COURT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_14 0 AND JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA ON IN THIS TAKES PRACTICE
Gkjo_HGLNs4_15 0 YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COME OUT HERE MAYBE ON THIS MY FIRST ONE BUT YOU'VE GOT TO JUST KEEP PRACTICING AND PRACTICING TO REALLY GET AN IDEA OF WHERE YOU WANT TO HIT A C BRING ONE HIP BACK TO THE MACHINE WEIGHT YOU GOT TO CRACK
Gkjo_HGLNs4_16 0 SO YOU AND I MISSED MY SHOT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_17 0 SO YOU KEEP PRACTICING YOU CAN START IN CLOSER IN USE THAT BACKWARD
Gkjo_HGLNs4_18 0 AND THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A GOOD AS STRATEGY IS TO SHOOT TWENTY FIFTY A HUNDRED TO ONE AND SHOTS FROM THIS SIDE I USE IN THE BACK COURT UNTIL YOU GET LOST IT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_19 0 KEEP SHOOTING LOOSEN THAT BACKWARD AND THEN STEP BACK ONE MORE STEP AND SHOOT OUT AND YOU'LL GET USED TO AND YOU'LL BE AN EXPERT TO WITH A GREAT LOOKING SHOT NO TIME
G6RqcJ7rSKY_1 0 WITH CALF RAISES WE WANT TO WORK THE LOWER PART AND BELOW THE KNEE INTO THE ACHILLES THAT POINT ATTACHMENT TO THE HEEL
G6RqcJ7rSKY_2 0 WITH THE WEIGHTS ARE FREE WEIGHTS HANGING RIGHT NOW BY YOUR SIDE OR AN OPTION WOULD BE TO PLANT THEM ON THE MEATY PART OF THE SHOULDER RESTING LIGHTLY ON TOP
G6RqcJ7rSKY_3 0 WHEN A SLIGHT BEND IN THE KNEES FEET HIP WIDTH APART AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP TO THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT WITHOUT LETTING GRAVITY PULL YOU FORWARD

h5-xMqT_n24_1 0 HI I'M LISA GOLDSWORTHY WITH ACE CARPET AND UPHOLSTERY CARE AND IN THIS SEGMENT I'M GOING TO DISCUSS THE POTTED PLANTS SPILL
h5-xMqT_n24_2 0 THE BEST THING TO DO WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS TO VACUUM IT AND WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND WOULD BE TO TAKE THE UPHOLSTERY CLEANING PART OF THAT
h5-xMqT_n24_3 0 THE REASON WHY I HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING THE UPHOLSTERY TOOL OF A VACUUM VERSUS THE B YOUR BRUSH IS THAT WE WANT TO TACKLE WE WANT TO EXTRACT THE LOOSE SOIL
h5-xMqT_n24_4 0 AND SOME ARE BEATER BAR ON THE VACUUM MAYBE A MAY ACTUALLY EMBED THE SOIL FURTHER BECAUSE IT'S IT'S DOING ITS JOB
h5-xMqT_n24_5 0 IT'S TRYING TO LOOSEN DIRT BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I'M USING A LITTLE BIT OF A DAMP SOIL BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES WE ARE PUTTING OUR PLANTS YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE WE HAVE A LITTLE WATER IN THERE TOO
h5-xMqT_n24_6 0 SO WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE MUD
h5-xMqT_n24_7 0 WE WANT TO EXTRACT THE LOOSE SOIL SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND DO STEP NUMBER ONE VACUUM
h5-xMqT_n24_8 0 NOW IN THAT VACUUMING PROCESS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT I WAS TAKING A CUP AND JUST PLACING IT ON THE SURFACE VERSUS SCRUBBING NEVER SCRUB
h5-xMqT_n24_9 0 SO JUST LET IT SIT THERE
h5-xMqT_n24_10 0 GET AS MUCH AS LOOSE SOIL UP AS YOU CAN ON THAT SAMPLE
G78nL9acDGo_1 0 ONE INDISPENSABLE FEATURE THAT YOU NEED WHEN YOU WRITE A CROSSWORD PUZZLE IS YOU NEED TO GET PEOPLE THE OUNCES
G78nL9acDGo_2 0 NOW THE TWO MAIN WAYS OF DOING THAT
G78nL9acDGo_3 0 ONE IS TO USE THE GRID FILLED IN HAS OF THE PIT USUALLY IN A SMALL OF VERSION
G78nL9acDGo_4 0 AND ONE PUBLICATION I DO THEM FOR THEY ACTUALLY DO IT IN THE SAME PUBLICATION ON THE SAME PAGE
G78nL9acDGo_5 0 BUT FLIP THE THE GRID UPSIDE DOWN WITH THE SOLUTION IT

hg0PYALmd64_1 0 OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON DRAWING THE SIX IRON
hg0PYALmd64_2 0 SO A DRAW OUT ONCE AGAIN IS TAKING THE BALL FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
hg0PYALmd64_3 0 IT'S A WAY OF AVOID A LOT OF TROUBLES IN YOUR WAY AND ALSO GETTING THE BALL IF THE GREEN IS HEAVILY BUNKER DEPENDS ON THE LEFT SIDE THIS IS A WAY OF TRACKING THE BALL TOWARD THE PIN
hg0PYALmd64_4 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NOW THAT WE'RE GETTING INTO LONGER IRONS AND THEY'RE NOT QUITE AS LOFTED YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GENERATE MORE SIDE SPIN ON IT
hg0PYALmd64_5 0 SO YOU GET THE NORMAL UNDER SPIN OF STRIKING A BALL WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE THE FACE LIKE THIS TO CREATE SOME SIDES BECAUSE OF THE BALL WILL SPIN AND GO TO THE LEFT

HB7sHwAxCBg_1 0 HELLO WELCOME TO EXPERT VILLAGE
HB7sHwAxCBg_2 0 MY NAME IS WAYNE PETERSEN DIRECTOR OF THE MASSACHUSETTS AUDUBON SOCIETY'S IMPORTANT BIRD AREAS PROGRAM AND WE'RE HERE THIS AFTERNOON AT THE DANIEL WEBSTER WILDLIFE SANCTUARY IN MARSHFIELD MASSACHUSETTS
HB7sHwAxCBg_3 0 NEXT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BACKYARD BIRDING A PLACE WHERE EVERYBODY HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET INVOLVED IN WHERE MANY PEOPLE'S INTERESTING BIRDING FIRST BEGINS
HB7sHwAxCBg_4 0 IN THINKING ABOUT BACKYARD BIRDING THERE ARE A VARIETY OF THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WILL MAXIMIZE THE EXPERIENCE
HB7sHwAxCBg_5 0 ONE OF THESE IS OBVIOUSLY TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF BIRDS WHICH MEANS THAT BY LOCATING YOUR FEEDERS IN PLACES WHERE THEY ARE RELATIVELY CLOSE TO SHRUBS THAT BIRDS CAN QUICKLY ESCAPE INTO OR TREES THAT THEY CAN FLY UP INTO A THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN MIND BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE SAFETY OF THE BACK YARD BIRD IS IMPORTANT
HB7sHwAxCBg_6 0 LIKEWISE IF YOU HAVE A CAT YOU SHOULD KEEP THE CAT INDOORS
HB7sHwAxCBg_7 0 UNFORTUNATELY LOTS OF FOLKS HAVE THE FEELING THAT IF THEY PUT A CAT OUT THE FRONT DOOR IN THEIR BIRDFEEDER'S IN THE BACKYARD AND THEY WON'T BE A CONFLICT WELL UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT THE CASE
HB7sHwAxCBg_8 0 LIKEWISE HAVING YOUR FEET ARE SITUATED IN PLACES WHERE YOU CAN SEE THEM IS IMPORTANT SO YOU WANT TO PUT THEM IN A PLACE WHERE YOU HAVE READY A VIEW ABILITY FROM A WINDOW OR WHATEVER

H0JD_OtYloQ_1 0 THERE ARE MANY OPTIONS FOR LITTER BOXES FOR KITTENS
H0JD_OtYloQ_2 0 AS THE KITTENS ARE QUITE YOUNG AND JUST LEARNING TO USE A LITTER BOX I RECOMMEND THE SORT OF FLAT TRAY LITTER BOXES
H0JD_OtYloQ_3 0 SIMILAR TO THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT MEAT COMES IN THE GROCERY STORE
H0JD_OtYloQ_4 0 YOU CAN PUT A SMALL AMOUNT OF LITTER MAYBE A LITTLE MORE THAN THIS AND THAT WAY THE KITTENS CAN JUST GET IN THERE AND THEY CAN LEARN TO FEEL THE TEXTURE OF IT SCRATCH AROUND BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY JUMP AND CLIMB IN
H0JD_OtYloQ_5 0 WE ARE ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE YOUNG AND THEY'RE NOT THAT WILL COORDINATED YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S EASY FOR THEM TO GET IN AND OUT OF THEIR LITTER BOX
H0JD_OtYloQ_6 0 SEE IF THIS LITTLE GIRL GO OUT FOR US
H0JD_OtYloQ_7 0 WE'RE GOING TO TRADE TO THIS ONE
H0JD_OtYloQ_8 0 THIS IS ALSO A LITTLE BIT OLDER KITTEN WOULD DO BETTER WITH THIS TYPE OF A LITTER BOX
H0JD_OtYloQ_9 0 IT'S A LITTLE BIT HIGHER SIDED SO THAT THEY DON'T KICK GLITTER AROUND
H0JD_OtYloQ_10 0 PROBABLY A FIVE OR SIX WEIKLE KITTEN WILL LIKE THAT
H0JD_OtYloQ_11 0 AND YOU SEE THIS KIT AND DOESN'T LIKE IT VERY MUCH
H0JD_OtYloQ_12 0 AND THEN AS THEY GET OLDER AND THEY'RE ABLE TO JUMP IN AND OUT THEY CAN USE A FULL SIDED LITTER BOX
H0JD_OtYloQ_13 0 KITTENS TEND TO PLAY A LOT IN THEIR LITTER SO YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT TOO MUCH LITTER IN THE BOX KEEP IT KIND OF THIN
H0JD_OtYloQ_14 0 AND IF THE HOT THE HIGH SIDES WILL KEEP THEM FROM KICKING LITTER ALL AROUND
H0JD_OtYloQ_15 0 BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THIS BOX IS IS BECAUSE THIS KIT AND SO IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE AGE OF THE KITTY

gg3XNPOBTqk_1 0 THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT BASKETBALL IS HOW TO STOP VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO LEARN HOW TO DO THIS FIRST STEP IN BASKETBALL EITHER YOUR RIGHT HAND IN YOUR LEFT HAND AND I'M RIGHT HANDED SO I USE MY RIGHT HAND AS MY SHOOTING AT MY LEFT HAND AS MY GUIDE
gg3XNPOBTqk_2 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS HAVE YOUR PANTS AND YOUR FINGER SPREAD APART ON THE BALL LEFT HAND GUIDING THE BALL SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE IF YOU'VE GOT YOUR BALL TOWARDS THE BASKET
gg3XNPOBTqk_3 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS WHEN YOU LIFT UP YOUR BEND THE LEGS AND YOU MOVE UP WITH THE BALL WITH THIS HAND YOU GUIDE IT SO IT IS A GO IN ANY OTHER DIRECTION BESIDES AN ACTION THAT YOU'RE GOING IN TOWARDS YOU MOVE THE BALL UP AND YOU ROLL IT WITH YOUR FINGERS
gg3XNPOBTqk_4 0 WITH THE FIRST THREE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO CREATE THE SHOT SO IT LOOKS LIKE THIS THAT'S WE'LL LOOK AT

GEVpAiTeQLI_4 0 SO WE'RE VERY CAREFULLY CUT AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE IMAGE
GEVpAiTeQLI_5 0 I LOVE THE IMAGE DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF YOUR SCREEN IT SHOULD ALL BE RELATIVE
GEVpAiTeQLI_6 0 BUT IT SHOULD DEFINITELY BE BIG ENOUGH THAT IT CAN BE SEEN FROM A DISTANCE
GEVpAiTeQLI_7 0 DEPENDING ON HOW MANY PEOPLE IN YOUR AUDIENCE
GEVpAiTeQLI_8 0 SO HOW MANY KIDS YOU WILL BE SHOWING THIS TOO
GEVpAiTeQLI_9 0 SO KEEP IN MIND KEEP IT ALL RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF THE SCREEN
GEVpAiTeQLI_10 0 OUR IMAGE IS ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE INCHES LONG FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
GEVpAiTeQLI_11 0 AND OUR SCREEN IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THAN A REGULAR PIECE OF A LOCAL PAPER COPY PAPER
GEVpAiTeQLI_12 0 NOT ONLY IS IT IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THE SIZE OF THE IMAGE THAT YOU'RE CREATING BUT ALSO WHEN YOU'RE CREATING MORE THAN ONE IMAGE WHICH YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE A ENTERTAINING SHOW
GEVpAiTeQLI_13 0 YOU SHOULD JUST MAKE THEM ALL KEEP THEM ALL THE BOTTOM OF SOMEWHAT OF AN EQUAL SIZE
GEVpAiTeQLI_14 0 SO THEY'RE ALL IN PROPORTION
GEVpAiTeQLI_15 0 SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE MAKING YOUR IMAGES
GEVpAiTeQLI_16 0 JUST KEEP IN MIND WHICH IMAGES ARE GOING TO BE USING THE SIZES OF EACH IMAGE THAT YOU'VE CREATED
GEVpAiTeQLI_17 0 WHEN YOU DO THE PROJECT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY BE CREATING SEVERAL IMAGES BECAUSE IT JUST MAKES THE WHOLE THING MORE FONDANT
GEVpAiTeQLI_18 0 AND YOU'RE ABLE TO CHANGE THE ABLE TO GO BACK AND FORTH BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE THE SILHOUETTE EFFECT
GEVpAiTeQLI_19 0 THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SEE YOUR HANDS ARE ONLY SEE THE IMAGE WHEN IT COMES CLOSE TO THE SCREEN
GEVpAiTeQLI_20 0 SO IT'S DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THAT TO MAKE MAKE SEVERAL IMAGES TO REALLY MAKE A NICE SHOW OUT OF IT
GEVpAiTeQLI_21 0 DON'T THINK THAT YOU SINCE WE'RE ONLY GOING TO BE USING YOUR TWO HANDS IF YOU HAVE TO LIMITED TO TO TWO IMAGES
GEVpAiTeQLI_22 0 JUST BE CAREFUL GOING AROUND THE EDGES OF THE IMAGE
GEVpAiTeQLI_23 0 IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE VERY SHARP POINTS MAY MAKE THE THE OUTER AREA A SHARP AS YOU CAN
GEVpAiTeQLI_24 0 BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO HELP THE SHADOW SHOAF SHOW THROUGH ANY INDENTATIONS TO TO HIGHLIGHT A NOSE OR A MOUTH
GEVpAiTeQLI_25 0 YOU SHOULD REALLY TRY TO MAKE A SEPARATE CUT FOR EACH OF THOSE
GEVpAiTeQLI_26 0 AND THAT'LL HELP THE THE IMAGE SO MUCH MORE CLEAR
GEVpAiTeQLI_27 0 SO THIS IS HOW WE CUT OUT THE IMAGE THAT WE'VE DRAWN

Hiri9RuDjec_1 0 HI
Hiri9RuDjec_2 0 I'M BEN ANDERSON WITH EXPERT VILLAGE I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT IN IN LIFE KEYBOARD SETTING
Hiri9RuDjec_3 0 A LOT OF KEYBOARD IT'S A LOT OF MUSICIANS TEN TEND TO FEEL WHEN THEY'RE PLAYING IN A LIVE BAND THAT THEY NEED TO PLAY BEEP THEY NEED TO BE PLAYING ALL THE TIME AND THAT REALLY REALLY ISN'T ALWAYS THE CASE
Hiri9RuDjec_4 0 IT'S IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WHAT SWEATS APPROPRIATE IN THIS SITUATION A SONG ON AND THAT'S DETERMINED BY A DYNAMIC LEVELS DYNAMIC LEVELS ARE VERY IMPORTANT THERE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN I PLAY KEYBOARDS THAT I DON'T PLAY ON STAGE WHILE THE OTHER MUSICIANS I'M PLAYING AND THAT'S BECAUSE BY PLAYING KEYBOARD I'M NOT REALLY ADDING ANYTHING EXTRA TO THE SONG INTO THE SOUND OF THE PIECE AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENTS
Hiri9RuDjec_5 0 IT'S NOT TO SAY THE KEYBOARD IS AN IMPORTANT KEYBOARD SHOULDN'T BE PLAYED BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO DETERMINE WHEN KEYBOARD IS APPROPRIATE AND WHEN IT'S NOT
Hiri9RuDjec_6 0 FOR EXAMPLE ONE DURING ONE SONG OF MY BANDS THERE'S A MOMENT WHERE IT THE SONG GETS KIND OF QUIET AND REALLY KIND OF RHYTHMIC AND IT'S HARD FOR ME TO IT SETS OF TO FIT ALONG WITH THAT WITH THE REST OF THE INSTRUMENTS DURING THE SONG JUST BECAUSE OF THE STYLE OF THE SONG SO I CUT OUT AND I DON'T PLAY AND IT'S ONLY FOR A FEW MEASURES AND IT REALLY DOESN'T AND DOESN'T MATTER TO ME
Hiri9RuDjec_7 0 IT GIVES ME A MOMENT TO SIT AND THINKING REMEMBER WHAT I HAVE TO DO LATER ON THE SONG
Hiri9RuDjec_8 0 SO IT'S IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK OF WHAT IS REALLY NECESSARY TO THAT SONG
Hiri9RuDjec_9 0 JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN PLAY AND YOU CAN PLAY ANYTHING DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO PLAY ALL THE TIME
Hiri9RuDjec_10 0 AGAIN IT'S ALL ABOUT EMPHASIZING AND SUPPORTING THE SONG AND SUPPORTING THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY THERE
Hiri9RuDjec_11 0 WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS IS THE SONG

h5RN8s9lM1I_4 0 ONE OF THE FIRST RULE IS ABOUT SETTING UP CAMPFIRE SITTING IS YOU WANT TO SET UP YOUR SITTING ON THE UPPER INSIDE OF THE FIRE SO PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO BREATHE A SMOKE FROM THE FIRE THAT'S BEING BLOWN DOWNWIND
h5RN8s9lM1I_5 0 AND OF COURSE WINDOWS INEVITABLY CHANGING ALL THE TIME SO THAT THE SMOKE MAY MOVING MAY AFFECT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SEEING IT RANGE IN A DIFFERENT TIMES BUT THERE'S GENERALLY A MORE DOWNWIND DIRECTION AND THAT'S A GOOD PLACE NOT TO SET UP ANY CAMPFIRE SEEING
h5RN8s9lM1I_6 0 THERE ARE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO CREATE SITTING FOR A CAMPFIRE IF YOU HAVE SOME OLD LOGS YOU CAN FIND IN THE WOODS OR SOME SOMEWHAT JUST SIT ON THAT CAN BE NICE AND COMFORTABLE AND CAN PROVIDE A BENCH FOR A FEW PEOPLE TO SIT ON
h5RN8s9lM1I_7 0 COOLER IF YOU'RE CAMPING IF YOUR CAR CAMPING OR A CANOE CAMPING AND HAVE A COOLER FOR YOUR FOOD
h5RN8s9lM1I_8 0 THESE COMFORTABLE CAMP CHEERS OR A GREAT IDEA TO HAVE ROOM TO CARRY THEM IN A CAR AGAIN OR A CANOE AND IF YOU HAVE LESS ROOM IN YOUR BACKPACK YOUR SOMETHING THE KNEES CRAZY <UNK> TYPE CHAIRS CAN BE A GOOD OPTION AS WELL
h5RN8s9lM1I_9 0 BUT EITHER WAY MAKE SURE YOU SET UP YOUR SITTING FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE CAMPFIRE SO THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE GETTING SPARKS IN IN THEIR FACES OR ON THEIR CLOTHES A LOT AND SO THAT PEOPLE CAN ENJOY THE WARM BUT NOT BEING TOO MUCH IN DANGER FROM THE FIRE ITSELF

G4TtivugIJA_7 0 YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING WORK AS PART OF TRAINING
G4TtivugIJA_8 0 BUT REALLY TERMS OF HAVING A STABLE JOB OR YOU HAVE A TITLE THAT DOESN'T AND AFTER ONE TO TWO YEARS IT'S ABOUT TWENTY YEARS TO GET THERE
G4TtivugIJA_9 0 SO IT'S A LONG RUG BUT IT'S FUN ALONG WIRE CAN BE FOR
G4TtivugIJA_10 0 TYPICALLY IF YOU WANT TO RUN A LAB YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A DOCTORAL DEGREE IN A NUMBER OF YEARS OF POST DOCTOR WORK

G4TtivugIJA_24 0 SOMETHING MULTITASKING BEING ABLE TO FLIP IT IN AND OUT OF DIFFERENT WORLD'S IS VERY HELPFUL
G4TtivugIJA_25 0 WHEN I THINK PATIENCE TO
G4TtivugIJA_26 0 SOME OF THE RESEARCH WE DO WILL DO EXPERIMENTS FOR THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AND NOTHING WILL WORK
G4TtivugIJA_27 0 THERE'S NOTHING TO SHOP FOR AND YET WE KNOW THE PROJECTS GOOD AND IT'S IMPORTANT AND WE HAVE TO SEE IT THROUGH

hfnK2tC7AI8_1 0 I'M JOHN GRADEN FROM THE MARTIAL ARTS TEACHER'S ASSOCIATION
hfnK2tC7AI8_2 0 BAKING IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF ALL FIGHTERS ARSENAL
hfnK2tC7AI8_3 0 A FAKE IS AN INDIRECT ATTACK AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE EASIEST A BALL TECHNIQUE FAKE
hfnK2tC7AI8_4 0 THIS IS CALLED THE FRONT SHOULDER FAKE
hfnK2tC7AI8_5 0 IN ORDER FOR A FAKE TO BE EFFECTIVE LET'S JUST START WITH THE RULE
hfnK2tC7AI8_6 0 WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF A FAKE TO GAIN TIME AND TO GAIN DISTANCE
hfnK2tC7AI8_7 0 AGAIN TIME I DO MY OPPONENT TO HESITATE BUT JUST A SECOND THEY CAN THINK I'M GOING TO FIRE UP SO THAT BUYS ME TIME
hfnK2tC7AI8_8 0 NUMBER TWO I CAN DISTANCE BY CLOSE IT AT LEAST HALF THE DISTANCE TO MY OPPONENT SO AGAIN TIME DISTANCE
hfnK2tC7AI8_9 0 SO WE DO THAT WITH THE FRONT SHOULDER FRAME
hfnK2tC7AI8_10 0 YOUR FRONT SHOULDER FAKE I WAS WE'RE GOING TO FIT SOMETHING LIKE A JAB
hfnK2tC7AI8_11 0 A FRONT SHORTER FAKE IN OR BE EFFECTIVE LEASING'S MOST EITHER
hfnK2tC7AI8_12 0 ONE OF THE WEAPON MUST BEGIN TRAVELING TO THE TARGET
hfnK2tC7AI8_13 0 TYPICALLY ABOUT HALF WAY IS GOOD
hfnK2tC7AI8_14 0 IN OTHER WORDS THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO IT THAT'S GOING TO GO
hfnK2tC7AI8_15 0 I GOT I GOT TO GET THAT THEIR FACE THAT WE WANT TO SEE THAT
hfnK2tC7AI8_16 0 TO I MUST CONVEY POWER SO I DON'T JUST DO THAT WITH THE ARM BUT I COMBINE THAT BY TURNING THE SHOULDER AND STEP IN HALF WAY IN
hfnK2tC7AI8_17 0 SO NOW THEY GET A SENSE OF ATTACK THEY GET A SENSE OF A WEAPON THEY GET A SENSE OF WHAT TARGETS BEING THREAD AND SO THIS BASE THE TECHNIQUE VERY EFFECTIVE
hfnK2tC7AI8_18 0 THIS NEXT THAT THE EFFECT OF THIS MAKES THE TECHNIQUE TO FAKE BELIEVABLE
hfnK2tC7AI8_19 0 THE THIRD ELEMENT IS YOU'VE GOT TO KIND OF SOMETIMES EXAGGERATE THE INTENTIONS AND I WAS THIS WON'T WORK AS WELL WATCH
hfnK2tC7AI8_20 0 ONE OR TWO
hfnK2tC7AI8_21 0 NUMBER TWO I KIND OF SHOULDER FAKE I THINK I'M GOING TO STEP IN A WAKEHAM
hfnK2tC7AI8_22 0 SO A GOOD SHOULDER FAKE FRONT SHOULDER FAKE HANDLES HALFWAY OUT SHOULDER SNAPS I STEP IN AND I'M LOOKING LIKE I'M GOING TO TRY TO THEM
hfnK2tC7AI8_23 0 SOMETIMES I'LL EXHALE REAL HARD OKAY JUST A LOT OF TORLEY THEY ALSO GET THE MESSAGE HERE I COME BUT I'M ALWAYS STEP IN HALF AGAIN
hfnK2tC7AI8_24 0 THEY MAY MOVE THEY MAY FIRE BACK ON ME THIS IS I HAVE NOT OVER COMMITTED ON A GOOD POSITION
hfnK2tC7AI8_25 0 THAT'S A FRONT SHOULDER FAKE
hfnK2tC7AI8_26 0 I'M JOHN GRADEN
hfnK2tC7AI8_27 0 FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT ME AT JOHN GRADEN <UNK> GUM
gVg5bHNCZCQ_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE PREPARING THE FISH HERE AND GETTING IT READY FOR OUR DISH IN THIS PARTICULAR SEGMENT
gVg5bHNCZCQ_2 0 SO WHAT I'VE DONE IS AN LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FISH ITSELF
gVg5bHNCZCQ_3 0 NOW WHEN I WAS GOING UP GRAHAM I USE TO MAKE THIS PARTICULAR DISH WITH HALIBUT
gVg5bHNCZCQ_4 0 IT'S ALSO BEEN MADE WITH COTTON
gVg5bHNCZCQ_5 0 IF THE FISH I'M USING TODAY IS TO LOCK THE OUT AND THE REASON I LIKE TO LAFAYETTE ARE FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS ACTUALLY
gVg5bHNCZCQ_6 0 NUMBER ONE IT'S READILY AVAILABLE IN THE TOE LOBBIA CAN ACTUALLY BE PURCHASED IT'S VERY ECONOMICAL AS WELL MUCH MORE SO THAN A CAT FISH OR I HALIBUT FISH
gVg5bHNCZCQ_7 0 NOW THESE PARTICULAR PIECES OF TO LOCK THE I HAPPEN TO BE GIANT SIZE
gVg5bHNCZCQ_8 0 WHEN THEY CAME THEY WERE ACTUALLY IN A HOLE ON A WHOLE FILLET THAT WAS QUITE LARGE
gVg5bHNCZCQ_9 0 SO WHAT I'VE GONE AHEAD AND DONE ONCE I GOT IT OUT OF THE PACKAGING YOU WANNA REFRIGERATE YOUR FISH PRIOR TO USING IT
gVg5bHNCZCQ_10 0 SO ONCE IT'S IN THE REFRIGERATOR OR ONCE YOU'RE READY TO USE IT GET IT OUT OF THE REFRIGERATOR RINSE IT OFF OF THE RINSE IT OFF WITH SOME COLD WATER PUT IT IN THE COLANDER LIKE I HAVE HERE
gVg5bHNCZCQ_12 0 IT'LL ACTUALLY KIND OF AIR DRY FOR YOU TO BE READY TO USE
gVg5bHNCZCQ_13 0 SO WHAT I'D THEN DO IS I JUST TAKE A COUPLE OF THE PIT PIECES AT A TIME PUT IT INTO THE DISH
gVg5bHNCZCQ_14 0 AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS LIGHTLY SALT AND PEPPER THE FILETS BECAUSE AS THE AS EVERYTHING IS ON ACTUALLY COOKING TOGETHER YOU WANT YOUR EVERY INGREDIENT TO MIX VERY NICELY AND BRINGING PUTTING A LITTLE BIT OF SALT ON THIS FISH AND IT'S IT'S A MILD SWEET FISH AND THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY I LIKE USING TO LOCK THE
gVg5bHNCZCQ_15 0 FOR PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE WHOEVER YOU'RE MAKING THIS FOR WHETHER IT BE FOR YOURSELF OR FOR FAMILY OR FRIENDS ON IT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT PEOPLE BEING ON YOU KNOW LOVING FISH OR OR WHETHER THERE ARE NOT THAT BIG FISHEATERS BECAUSE THE TASTE IS VERY VERY MILD ON THE TOP YOU
gVg5bHNCZCQ_16 0 SO LIKE I LIKE LIKE I'M DOING JUST GO AHEAD AND ONE SALT THE FISH LIGHTLY ON BOTH SIDES AND THEN GO TO THE PEPPER AND THIS IS FINE GROUND PEPPER
gVg5bHNCZCQ_17 0 WHEN I USE OF PEPPER MILL AND IF YOU HAVE A PEPPER MILL YOURSELF ON THE COARSELY GROUND PEPPER YOU CAN NOT USE A LITTLE LESS
gVg5bHNCZCQ_18 0 AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE MINUTES AND PUT PEPPER AND BOTH SALT AND PEPPER ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FISH
gVg5bHNCZCQ_19 0 AND BY NOW YOU KNOW THE FISH IS IS MOIST ENOUGH TO WHERE IT'S ACTUALLY HOLDING THE SALT AND PEPPER ON IT BUT NOT DRIPPING WET
gVg5bHNCZCQ_20 0 SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS KIND OF HAVE IT A LITTLE BIT WET BUT NOT DRIPPING
gVg5bHNCZCQ_21 0 AND SO THE FISH NOW IS READY FOR ON PRESENTATION AND ACTUALLY PLACING IT INTO THE DISH
gVg5bHNCZCQ_22 0 SO OUR NEXT STEP IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE PREPARING THE POTATOES AND THE ONIONS

gCiyrgVaqR4_25 0 AND MAKE SURE YOUR VOCALS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE AND THINGS ARE MOVING AROUND UNLESS YOU MAKE THEM MOVE AROUND OR WANT THEM TOO
gCiyrgVaqR4_26 0 THERE'S A LOT OF POWER TO BE HAT WHEN MAKING MUSIC IN THE COMPUTER A LOT OF AUTOMATION THINGS

gYvA5mYV2wY_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS ZEPHYR <UNK> FROM MIAMI DOG TRAINING
gYvA5mYV2wY_2 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO CHOOSE A GERMAN SHEPHERD
gYvA5mYV2wY_3 0 NOW FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS A PUREBRED DOG GERMAN SHEPHERD AND THE MORE PURE THE LINES THE MORE THEY WANT TO DO THEIR JOB
gYvA5mYV2wY_4 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GERMAN SHEPHERD YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR A NICE STRONG BONES YOU WANT TO SEE BOTH PATENTS IF YOU CAN YOU WANT TO ITEM YOU KNOW YOU WANT YOU WANT TO LEARN IS MUCH ABOUT THE HEREDITY THAT YOU CAN FROM THE DOG THAT YOU HAVE
gYvA5mYV2wY_5 0 SO IN CHOOSING A GERMAN SHEPHERD YOU WANT YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU WANT TO SMALLER DOG
gYvA5mYV2wY_6 0 MAYBE YOU WANT TO TRY TO FIND LINES THAT ARE SMALLER
gYvA5mYV2wY_7 0 SOME LINES ARE BIGGER
gYvA5mYV2wY_8 0 THIS IS A HUGE FEMALE GERMAN SHEPHERD
gYvA5mYV2wY_9 0 AND THE LIKE I SAID BEFORE SHE LOVES TO WORK
gYvA5mYV2wY_10 0 NOW THIS IS ANOTHER KIND OF SHEPARD
gYvA5mYV2wY_11 0 AND THIS IS A MIXED BRAID
gYvA5mYV2wY_12 0 YOU CAN SEE THESE IS MOSTLY SHEPARD BUT THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT
gYvA5mYV2wY_13 0 NOTICE THE LONGER TO THE THE SHORTER SNOUT THAN THE STANDARD GERMAN SHEPHERD
gYvA5mYV2wY_14 0 HE'S GOT STAND UP YEARS YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE NOT KIND OF BATTEY LIKE THE GERMAN SHEPHERD
gYvA5mYV2wY_15 0 AND IF YOU NOTICE HE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH SUN IF HE DOESN'T HAVE A BODY SLOPE LIKE A GERMAN SHEPHERD
gYvA5mYV2wY_16 0 HE'S BUILT YOU KNOW IT IS BACK IS MUCH MORE LEVEL IS TAIL SHORTER AND HE'S A LITTLE SMALLER BONES
gYvA5mYV2wY_17 0 BUT HE'S GOT A HYBRID VIGER LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
gYvA5mYV2wY_18 0 SO SOMETIMES A MIX BREED MAYBE WHAT YOU WANT
gYvA5mYV2wY_19 0 A LOT OF TIMES THE MIX BREEDS CAN BE HEARTIER AND THE TEN TEND TO DO REALLY WELL
gYvA5mYV2wY_20 0 THEY'RE GREAT DOGS AND THERE'S NO REASON ANYBODY SHOULD WE WANT TO MIX BREED GERMAN SHEPHERD JUST AS WELL
gYvA5mYV2wY_21 0 THIS IS ZEPHYR CLOCK DAHLBERG AND THIS HAS BEEN HOW TO CHOOSE A GERMAN SHEPHERD
GrSGwmMdamM_1 0 OKAY SO IT REALLY HARD TO FIND OUT FROM
GrSGwmMdamM_2 0 AND WHAT I WANT READY TO DO IS GO THROUGH SOME ITEMS HERE AND EDUCATE AT AND INTO THE INGREDIENTS AND READ THE LABELS
GrSGwmMdamM_3 0 SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE
GrSGwmMdamM_4 0 SO THE FIRST THING THAT I SEE IS LIPSTICK
GrSGwmMdamM_5 0 DID YOU KNOW THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN WOMAN WILL END UP SWALLOWING TEN POUNDS OF PETROLEUM BY PRODUCT FROM WHEN LIPSTICK ON A DAILY BASIS
GrSGwmMdamM_6 0 THAT IS BECAUSE NOSE SLIPS STICKS ARE MADE WITH PETROLEUM BY PRODUCTS
GrSGwmMdamM_7 0 SO IT'S GOING TO READ THE LABELS BY LIPSTICKS THAT ARE MADE WITHOUT THE TRAILING BY PRODUCTS
GrSGwmMdamM_8 0 LET'S OPEN UP THE DRUM
GrSGwmMdamM_9 0 WELL IT COMES FROM A HIGHLY TOXIC SUBSTANCE PETROLEUM AND WHEN YOU ADJUST IT INTO YOUR BODY EVEN AND TRACE AMOUNTS OBVIOUSLY TEN POUNDS MY HOUSE IS A LOT THAT THAT'S THROUGH TRACE AMOUNTS
GrSGwmMdamM_10 0 IT'S THROUGH LICKING YOUR LIPS WITH YOUR LIPSTICK ON A DAILY
GrSGwmMdamM_11 0 WHAT IT OUT LIKE THIS THIS AT THE TOP
GrSGwmMdamM_12 0 NOW I WOULD NEVER USE THIS OKAY EVER NOW
GrSGwmMdamM_14 0 SO HERE WE HAVE A BASIC MOISTURIZING CREAM HAND CREAM HERE'S THE LIST OF INGREDIENTS
GrSGwmMdamM_15 0 YOU START READING DOWN AND YOU SEE ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CAUSES THE CONTACT DERMATOLOGIST WHICH IS SWELLING RASH BREAKOUTS
GrSGwmMdamM_16 0 IT'S THE NUMBER ONE DERMATOLOGICAL PROBLEM IS ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO THIS INGREDIENT DIAZO VINYL YOUR RED AND IT'S A NINETY NINE PERCENT OF ALL PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS
GrSGwmMdamM_17 0 SO EVEN IF WE CAN'T PRONOUNCE IT WE CAN CERTAINLY LEARN HOW TO WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THE RULE IS IS THAT IF YOU CAN'T PRONOUNCE IT YOU SHOULD BE HAVING AN IN YOUR BODY
GrSGwmMdamM_18 0 IT'S LIKE THE THINGS THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY IF YOU HAD OUR SKIN CARE PRODUCTS THAT WE USE YOU COULD ACTUALLY EAT MOVE BECAUSE THERE'S SOAK YOUR
GrSGwmMdamM_19 0 AND THAT SORT OF THE THE LITMUS TEST IF YOU'RE YES IT AND YOU CAN EAT IT WHY WOULD YOU PUT IT IN YOUR BODY OR ON YOUR BODY
GrSGwmMdamM_21 0 WHY WOULD YOU LET IT GO INTO YOUR SKIN
GrSGwmMdamM_22 0 THE NEXT THING THAT WE SEE IS COMMON BABY POWDER
GrSGwmMdamM_23 0 THE KEY INGREDIENT TO THIS IS TALC IT'S A FILLER IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
GrSGwmMdamM_24 0 IT JUST CLOGS THE PORES AND CAUSES DIRT AND DEBRIS TO STAY LOCKED INTO THE SKIN IT'S HIGHLIGHTED BABIES HAVE RASHES
GrSGwmMdamM_25 0 BUT THEN YOU START PUTTING THE TALC ON THEM AND INCREASES THE RASH
GrSGwmMdamM_26 0 SO YOU START INTO THIS DISHES
GrSGwmMdamM_27 0 FREE
GrSGwmMdamM_28 0 JUST THINK OF BREATHING IS STARTING TO VICIOUS CYCLE
hdNqibUubIU_1 0 NEXT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS THE SUBSTRATE FOR YOUR AQUARIUM SUBSTRATES A FANCY WASTING BEDDING
hdNqibUubIU_2 0 IT'S AQUARIUM BUT IT STILL HAS BETTING ON THE BOTTOM OF IT AND WE'LL BE USING FOR THAT IS GRAVEL ESSENTIALLY
hdNqibUubIU_3 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE BUYING A GRAVEL FROM A PET STORE OR A ARM IT MAKE SURE THAT THIS PET SAFE
hdNqibUubIU_4 0 NOT ALL GRAVEL IS CREATED EQUAL
hdNqibUubIU_5 0 SO THAT CAN LEACH THINGS IN YOUR WATER AND CREATE PROBLEMS
hdNqibUubIU_6 0 ALSO MAKE SURE YOU'RE BUYING A VERY LARGE GRAVEL
hdNqibUubIU_7 0 THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS CALLED A SO THE RIVER CREEK PEDAL
hdNqibUubIU_8 0 IT'S A LARGER THAN WHAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY SEE IN A FISH AQUARIUM
hdNqibUubIU_9 0 THE REASON THAT IS BECAUSE TURTLES DO HAVE A TEN SOMETIMES TO LIKE TO TRY TO EAT GRAVEL

h749Xa_kMH4_3 0 IT'S JUST WATERCOLOR ON PAPER RIGHT
h749Xa_kMH4_4 0 WELL NOT EXACTLY
h749Xa_kMH4_5 0 AND LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAPER THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO WATER COLOR ARTIST
h749Xa_kMH4_6 0 FIRST OF ALL MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO USE HUNDRED AND FORTY POUND PAPER OFTEN BY A FLOORING MAKER

h749Xa_kMH4_8 0 AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS IS A FULL SHEET THAT HAS DECAL THE EDGES
h749Xa_kMH4_9 0 WHEN WE OF WORK IN FULL SHEET THIS IS THE SIZE THAT THEY WOULD REFER TO THEIR ALL ALSO DOUBLE ELEPHANT
h749Xa_kMH4_10 0 AND I'LL SHOW YOU SOME SMALLER SIZES
h749Xa_kMH4_11 0 THIS IS A HALF SHEET AND A MUCH SHE HEAVIER PAPER
h749Xa_kMH4_12 0 THESE ARE BOTH COLD PRESSED PAPERS
h749Xa_kMH4_13 0 A HUNDRED AND FORTY OF THESE OF ARENA THESE WOULD WEIGH A HUNDRED FORTY POUNDS BUT A REMOVE THESE AWAY THREE HUNDRED POUNDS AND YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE PAPER
h749Xa_kMH4_14 0 THERE'S ANOTHER KIND OF PAPER CALL HOT PRESS AS VERSUS THE SKULL PRESSED PAPER THAT I'VE SHOWN YOU
h749Xa_kMH4_15 0 AND YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH SMOOTHER THE SURFACE OF THAT PAPER IS
h749Xa_kMH4_16 0 IT'S ALMOST GLASSY AND THE PAINT SITS ON DIFFERENTLY
h749Xa_kMH4_17 0 IT DOESN'T ABSORB
h749Xa_kMH4_18 0 YOU COULD FOR HALF A GALLON OF WATER PRACTICALLY ON A THREE HUNDRED POUND PAPER
h749Xa_kMH4_19 0 AND THAT'S IT WOULD TEND TO FIT MUCH MORE AND BE LESS ABSORBENT

h749Xa_kMH4_21 0 SOME TABLETS HAVE ONLY NINETY POUND WEIGHT PAPER
h749Xa_kMH4_22 0 AND THE NINETY POUND ESPECIALLY NEEDS TO BE STRETCHED BECAUSE AFTER YOU'VE GOTTEN AT ALL WET IT WILL BE VERY WAVY AND YOU WON'T END UP WITH A SMOOTH SURFACE
h749Xa_kMH4_23 0 SO YOU'LL NEED TO TAPE OR PIN THE EDGES OF NINETY PEN AND PAPER
h749Xa_kMH4_24 0 THERE ARE A THIS IS AN INDIAN PAPER
h749Xa_kMH4_25 0 AND YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN THAT

h749Xa_kMH4_28 0 AND OF PROPERLY ON OUR HAS JUST A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TEXTURE TO IT THAN ARCHES
h749Xa_kMH4_29 0 WATT IF THE PAPER DOESN'T LOOK GOOD FROM THE FRONT YOU CAN TURN IT OVER THE BAT
h749Xa_kMH4_30 0 IT'S REALLY NOT TERRIBLY DIFFERENT
h749Xa_kMH4_31 0 YOU CAN ALSO A CUFF THESE WITH SCISSORS CERTAINLY OR YOU CAN JUST FOR THEM AND USE THEM FOR ACRYLICS OIL OR SOMETHING ELSE
h749Xa_kMH4_32 0 YOU CAN BUY WATERCOLOR PAPER AND BLOCKS
h749Xa_kMH4_33 0 AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT ANOTHER TIME
h749Xa_kMH4_34 0 BUT THE BLOCKS ARE GLUED ON FOUR SIDES AND REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF TOO MANY RIDGES IS YOUR PAINTING AND GETTING YOUR PAPER REALLY WET
h749Xa_kMH4_35 0 THIS IS AGAIN AND ARCHES PAPER COLD PRESSED
h749Xa_kMH4_36 0 THIS IS FINE GRAIN AS OPPOSED TO A KIND OF PAPER YOU CAN BUY WHICH IS TERMED ROUGH

gWa4CfhEvN8_1 0 ALRIGHT NOW AH IT'S TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHEN THE TO TAKE THE WIND WHEN IT IS IS READY TO A TO PUT IN THE BOTTLES AND AND THE AND THE POSSIBLY EVEN TAKE A TASTE AND SEE IF IT'S READY
gWa4CfhEvN8_2 0 SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE WIND IS WHEN YOU START A BOTTLE OF WINE IS THERE'S GOING TO BE A BUBBLING EFFECT
gWa4CfhEvN8_3 0 AND THIS ONE HAS BEEN WORKING FOR A WHILE BUT THIS THIS BALL WINE STILL HAS BUBBLES THAT THERE ARE BUBBLING UP CONSTANTLY
gWa4CfhEvN8_4 0 AND IT'S A VISUAL THING YOU CAN SEE THEM
gWa4CfhEvN8_5 0 WHEN YOU FIRST START UP A WINE IT'S BUBBLING REALLY FAST SO YOU WILL YOU'LL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR BECAUSE WHEN STUFF BUBBLING AND IT'S CLEAR AS YOU CAN SEE WITH THIS WINE HERE
gWa4CfhEvN8_6 0 YOU CAN SEE LIKE GOING THROUGH IT AND VERY CLEAR
gWa4CfhEvN8_7 0 IF YOU HOLD UP THIS ONE HERE YOU CAN SEE IT'S STILL CLOUDY AND IT'S NOT READY YET
gWa4CfhEvN8_8 0 AND IN THIS PARTICULAR WINE HERE THERE WASN'T THAT WAS MORE YEAST AND IT WAS SUGAR AND THE YEAST PLAYED OUT THE SUGAR
gWa4CfhEvN8_9 0 IF IT WAS STILL BUBBLING AND THE ANIMAL IS REAL SWEET WINE THEN YOU PUT TOO MUCH SUGAR IN IT AND IT PLAYED OUT THE YEAST
gWa4CfhEvN8_10 0 SO YOU GOT IT THERE'S A FINE LINE BETWEEN YEASTY SUGAR SO THAT YOU DON'T PLAY ONE OUT BEFORE THAT BEFORE THE WINDS READY
gWa4CfhEvN8_11 0 SO IN THIS CASE RIGHT HERE WITH THIS BLUEBERRY PEACH WINE IT'S CLEAR IS NOT BUBBLING ANYMORE SO IT'S READY TO TAKE AND BOTTLE
gnHbeZIq5nU_1 0 OKAY WE A
gnHbeZIq5nU_2 0 WE'RE SHOOTING OUR LINE OUT NOW AND THEN WHAT YOU MIGHT NOTICE IS THAT WE HAVE TO RETRIEVE THE LINE SOMEHOW
gnHbeZIq5nU_3 0 THAT'S CALLED STRIP IN THE LINE
gnHbeZIq5nU_4 0 IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO IS TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF
gnHbeZIq5nU_5 0 STRIP AND JUST MEANS PULL IN THE LINE BACK IN AND THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GOING TO RETRIEVE MOST OF THE TIME WHEN YOUR FLY FISHING
gnHbeZIq5nU_6 0 THE REAL WILL NOT COME INTO PLAY A LOT OF THE TIME UNLESS YOU HOOK A REALLY BIG FISH ANY PULLS ALL YOUR SLACK OUT THAT YOU HAVE TRAP TO INTO YOUR FINGER AND THEN YOU KNOW WHO WILL GET ON THE REEL
gnHbeZIq5nU_7 0 MOST OF THE TIME WHEN WE'RE FLY FISHING WE'RE GOING TO DO MOST OF OUR TREVEN LIKE THIS BY STRIP AND ONLINE WHETHER WE'RE STRIP OF THE LINE TO TREAT THE FLY OR TO PICKUP SLACK
gnHbeZIq5nU_8 0 OR IF WE IF WE HOOK A FISH A MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IF YOU'VE GOT SOME SLACK HERE WHICH IS GOING TO DO THIS CLAMP DOWN THERE AND STRIP THE LINE TO RETRIEVE IT
gnHbeZIq5nU_9 0 YOU CAN STRIP LIME AND RETRIEVE MUCH FASTER THAN YOU CAN BUY A REAL IN
gnHbeZIq5nU_10 0 I CAN PULL IN THE THREE OR FOUR FELINE PRETTY QUICKLY THIS WAY OR AS BY IF I WAS TRYING TO REEL IT IN WITH THE REAL THAT HAVE TO DO SEVERAL CRANKS TO GET THAT LINE IN
gnHbeZIq5nU_11 0 SO STRIP OF THE LINE IS VERY IMPORTANT
gnHbeZIq5nU_12 0 SO YOU KNOW WHETHER YOUR CAST AND YOU JUST WANT TO PULL YOUR LINE BACK IN AFTER YOU SHOT IT OUT TO MAKE THE NEXT CAST OR WHETHER YOU'VE ACTUALLY HOOK THE FISH AND YOU WANT TO TRY TO RETRIEVE THAT LINE AS QUICK AS YOU CAN THIS IS THIS IS WHAT WE CALL STRIPPING LINE RIGHT HERE

g9dv4TRFIxI_9 0 ANY HAIR STYLE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO USE A LOT OF PRODUCT
g9dv4TRFIxI_10 0 I RECOMMEND USING A MOUSSE PUTTING IN THE HAIR WHEN IT'S WET AND USING THE HAIR OUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FOREVER STYLE YOU CHOOSE
g9dv4TRFIxI_11 0 AND THEN YOU NEED TO USE THE HAIRSPRAY AFTER THAT IN ORDER TO HOLD IT IN PLACE
g9dv4TRFIxI_12 0 AND THEY'RE STYLES REALLY A CENTER PIECE OF THE GOTHIC LOOK
g9dv4TRFIxI_13 0 IN ADDITION TO HAIRSTYLE THE HAIR COLOR SHOULD BE VERY VERY DARK

GrNLTXAatQ4_7 0 YOU CAN HAVE ACTUALLY IT BRING IN A SUSHI ROLLER AND HAVE THEM ROLLING SEE SHE AS YOUR GUESTS ARE EATING AND GOING THROUGH THE LAW OF SAY
GrNLTXAatQ4_8 0 AND ANOTHER OPTION IS THAT YOU CAN DO THAT ME SHE DUCK STATION AND WHICH IS FUN AND JUST SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT'S NOT USUALLY OFFERED AT WEDDING RECEPTION
GrNLTXAatQ4_9 0 THERE'S ALSO IF YOU WANT TO DO A PLAY TO DINNER YOU COULD START OFF YOUR APPETIZER COURSE WITH SPRING ROLLS OR DO IF YOU'RE JUST SEE SHE'S PRESENTATION AND HAT SERVE IT FAMILY STYLE AND THEN YOU CAN OFFER SOME DIFFERENT SAUCES TO ACCOMPANY THAT

gzHnaTpBgv4_1 0 SOME OF THE COMMON MISTAKES THAT PEOPLE MAKE WHILE THEY'RE LEARNING HOW TO FAKIE HEEL FLIP ARE USUALLY JUST BEING COMFORTABLE ROLLING IN THE FAKIE POSITION
gzHnaTpBgv4_2 0 YOU DON'T SPEND AS MUCH TIME ROLLING FAKIE AS YOU DO ROLLING FORWARD SO REQUIRES A LITTLE MORE SPOT TO BE PREPARED TO ROLL FAKIE
gzHnaTpBgv4_3 0 ONE OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE USUALLY HAVE IS THEY DON'T PUT ENOUGH WEIGHT OVER THE FRONT OF THE BOARD
gzHnaTpBgv4_4 0 WHAT THIS DOES IS IT REPLACES THE THE MOMENTUM THAT YOU FEEL WHEN YOU'RE HEADED TOWARDS THE TAIL
gzHnaTpBgv4_5 0 WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS LEAN WHILE YOU DO THE FAKIE OLLIE LEAN FORWARD TO COMPENSATE AND BALANCE OUT THE TRICK
gzHnaTpBgv4_6 0 WHAT PEOPLE USUALLY DON'T DO IS WHILE THE ROLLING BACKWARDS THEY TEND TO LEAN BACK THIS WAY ONCE THEY'VE OLLIE AND HEEL FLIP AND KEEP GOING IN THIS POSITION
gzHnaTpBgv4_7 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO TO FIX THAT IS YOU WANT TO SET UP IN YOUR HEEL FLIP POSITION TO HIT THE TAIL AND AND REPLACE THE WEIGHT ON THE FRONT SIDE OF IT SO THAT YOUR WEIGHT IS BALANCED EVENLY AND IT ENDS UP FLIPPING STRAIGHT AND YOU'RE ABLE TO ROLL AWAY
gzHnaTpBgv4_8 0 ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT YOU MAY HAVE LEARNING FAKIE HEEL FLIPS IS THAT IT JUST DOESN'T FLIP AND UP
gzHnaTpBgv4_9 0 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO THEN IS POSSIBLY ADJUST YOUR FOOT PLACEMENT BY HANGING YOUR TOE A LITTLE MORE OFF THE BOARD
gzHnaTpBgv4_10 0 THIS IS A VERY COMMON MISTAKE
gzHnaTpBgv4_11 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS JUST TEST WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU AT THE SPEED THAT YOU'RE ROLLING
gzHnaTpBgv4_12 0 YOUR BACK FOOT ON THE BACK CORNER YOUR FOOT OVER HERE THAT'S HOW YOU BALANCE THE HEEL FLIP AND THE OLLIE AND THEN REMEMBER TO LEAN FORWARD SO THAT YOU DON'T LEAN TOO FAR BACK AND KICK AND DON'T HAVE IT LANDS UNDERNEATH YOU AND THAT WILL HELP YOU LEARN HOW TO HEEL FLIP FAKIE
ggx79z62v60_1 0 HI THIS IS JOHN STEWART AND THIS IS HOW TO STAKE-OUT A TENT AND ONCE YOU'VE SET IT UP
ggx79z62v60_2 0 THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES OF STAKES THEY ALL COME PLAY KEY ROLLS WHEN SETTING UP TENSE IN DIFFERENT AREAS
ggx79z62v60_3 0 FIRST I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS JUST NORMAL CAMPING OUT THE WOODS
ggx79z62v60_4 0 MOST THE TIME YOU'LL HAVE A MOIST GROUND
ggx79z62v60_5 0 THIS IS WHEN YOU CAN TAKE AND USE A REAL LIGHT WEIGHT STEAK A METAL ONE REAL LIGHT WEIGHT PLASTIC
ggx79z62v60_6 0 SOMETHING THAT'S JUST GOING TO GET IN THE GROUND AND HOLD YOUR TENT DOWN AND CASES STRONG LANDS FOR REINS ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR RAIN FILE
ggx79z62v60_7 0 IF YOU'RE OUT IN THE SANDY AREA OR SNOWY AREA THEY HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A SNOW STEAK OR SAND STEAK
ggx79z62v60_8 0 WHAT THESE ARE THESE ARE POUCH IS THAT YOU FILL UP WITH SNOWS OR SAND AND THEN YOU JUST PULL THEM TIGHT AND CLIP THEM ONTO THE TENT WHERE IT HOLDS IT WEIGHS DOWN YOUR TENT
ggx79z62v60_9 0 OTHER THINGS THAT WORK AND SNOW AND SAND OR BIGGER STAKES MOST THE TIME THEY COME IN A T SHAPE TOWARD THAT GO IN AND THEY'VE GOT A BIG BLADE THAT KEEPS THEM FROM PULLING AGAINST THE TENT
ggx79z62v60_10 0 THESE WORK REALLY WELL ONCE YOU GET INTO THE LIGHT TWELVE FOURTEEN INCH SIZE STAKES
ggx79z62v60_11 0 SO THAT'S SOME OF THE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF STATES YOU CAN USE
ggx79z62v60_12 0 YOU CAN EASILY REPAIR YOUR STAKES FIVE DUCK TAPING THEM OR YOU CAN GO IN AND JUST FIND A HARD WOOD SHARPEN ONE END OF IT AND USE THAT AS A STATE THAT'S EASY REPLACEMENT
ggx79z62v60_13 0 WHEN YOU DO STEAK OUT YOUR TENT YOU WANT TO PUT THEM IN AT A FORTY FIVE DEGREE ANGLE INTO THE GROUND AND DON'T BE THEM ALL THE WAY INTO THE GROUND IT'S OF PAIN IN THE BUT THEN GET THEM OUT
ggx79z62v60_14 0 AND THIS IS HOW TO STEAK OUT YOUR TENT WHEN SETTING UP YOUR TENT
Gv5roKhJFRU_1 0 THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON AN ALTERNATE TURN TO THE RIGHT
Gv5roKhJFRU_2 0 AGAIN IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME BASIC FOOT MOVEMENT IN TERMS OF THE RHYTHM THAT YOUR FEET ARE MOVING IN WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE TO THE RIGHT THIS TIME AND WE'RE GOING TO BE PICKING UP OUR RIGHT FOOT AS SOON AS WE PUT IT DOWN ALMOST
Gv5roKhJFRU_3 0 SO WE'LL START WITH THE FEET SAME KIND OF MOVE THIS LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT
Gv5roKhJFRU_4 0 YOU MIGHT FEEL COMFORTABLE YOU CAN SEE MY FOR MY LEFT FOOT KIND OF SLIGHTLY TAKING OUT THERE ON THE TURN
Gv5roKhJFRU_5 0 AFTER THAT RIGHT FOOT PICKS UP OR IT CAN SWIVEL
Gv5roKhJFRU_6 0 RIGHT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT
Gv5roKhJFRU_7 0 AGAIN WE'RE NOT GOING TO USUALLY DO IT SO MANY TIMES IN A ROW BECAUSE YOU WILL GET BUSY
Gv5roKhJFRU_8 0 SO IF YOU WANT TO STOP AND START THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE TOO
Gv5roKhJFRU_9 0 YOU WOULD PROBABLY IN A SOLO YOU WOULD PROBABLY ONLY BE DOING THIS MAYBE ONE TIME
Gv5roKhJFRU_10 0 SO WITH THE ARMS WITH THAT AGAIN IT'S THE SAME ARMS FOR
Gv5roKhJFRU_11 0 WOMEN IF YOU'RE STRETCHING IN THE WAY WE GOT BAGS OR AS A GUIDE IF IT'S HOLY OKAY TO JUST HOLD ONTO THEM WELL YOU TURN KIND OF KEEP THEM IN PLACE SO THAT THEY DON'T GET ALL TWIST IT AROUND YOUR LEGS
Gv5roKhJFRU_12 0 SO JUST PRACTICE THAT A FEW TIMES
Gv5roKhJFRU_13 0 IT'S NOT QUITE AS COMMON AS THE FIRST TWO BUT IT DOES HAPPEN IT'S A NICE ALTERNATIVE TO THE BASIC TURNED ONCE AGAIN
h04oX5qhBCY_1 0 SOMETHING ELSE IN THIS
h04oX5qhBCY_2 0 IF THERE'S ANY TIPS I CAN GIVE YOU IS IN YOUR CAREER IT'S BEEN A POLICE OFFICER A GET TO WHERE YOU GET USED TO LISTENING TO PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO ALLOW THIS IN
h04oX5qhBCY_3 0 LISTEN TO THEM AND THEY UNDERSTAND IN A WITH THAT
h04oX5qhBCY_4 0 THERE'S GOING TO BE TIMES IS HIM LISTEN QUITE A BIT AND NOT TOM TALK MUCH AT ALL SO HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE AND IS A GREAT GREAT TOOL
h04oX5qhBCY_5 0 AND ALSO AS FAR AS TRYING TO REASON IF PEOPLE CAUSE YOU WANT TO YOUR GO ME WITH PEOPLE AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO TALK TO PEOPLE AND COME ON DOWN YOU CAN BE PRETTY SUCCESSFUL IN YOUR CAREER
h04oX5qhBCY_6 0 SO THE THINGS WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME WHEN I FIRST BECOME AN OFFICER I WAS LIKE IS KIND OF SHOT YOU WOULD SAY BUT A THROUGH THE DIFFERENT JOBS I'VE DONE COMMUNITY SPEAKING WAS PRETTY TERRIBLE

h04oX5qhBCY_8 0 NOW A IT'S NOT THE FAVORITE MOST FAVORITE THING TO DO BUT I FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT
h04oX5qhBCY_9 0 AND WITH THAT YOU CAN A YOU DON'T STRESS OUT AS MUCH AND IT MAKES YOUR JOB A LOT EASIER
h04oX5qhBCY_10 0 AND SO IF YOU'RE GOOD AT COMMUNITY SPEAKING NOT AFRAID OF IT YOU'LL DO WELL WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT
h04oX5qhBCY_11 0 IF SOMETHING IS SCARED OF A MAYBE TAKE A CLASS ON SPEAKING OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE AND JUST GETTING UP AND DOING IT
h04oX5qhBCY_12 0 SAME WITH THE IF YOUR PROFESSIONAL WELDER THE MORE YOU WELL THE BETTER YOU GET THE MORE COMFORTABLE YOU GET WITH THAT
h04oX5qhBCY_13 0 IT'S KIND OF ROUGH IT FIRST BUT YOU JUST JUMP IN AND YOU GO ON IT'S FUN ENJOY IT
h04oX5qhBCY_14 0 SOME OF THE FILL A ANOTHER TIP IS THE PHYSICAL FITNESS PART OF IT
h04oX5qhBCY_15 0 AS AN OFFICER MAYBE PHYSICAL FIT
h04oX5qhBCY_16 0 SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO THINK ABOUT GETTING THE CARROT ACADEMY START RUNNING START WHETHER IT'S LIFTING THEIR PUSH UP SIT UPS JUST GET IN THE SHAPE BECAUSE OUR MAIN GOAL IS TO THE OFFICERS GO HOME AND FOR IF YOU'RE IN SHAPE THAT'S A BETTER IS THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING TO GO HOME ARE BETTER CHANCE YOU'RE GOING HOME A NOT A HALF TO LAST FOR THINGS LIKE THAT
h04oX5qhBCY_17 0 SUSTAIN SHAPE IS IS A HUGE THING
h04oX5qhBCY_18 0 AND A YOU'RE GOING IF YOU'RE AFRAID OF GETTING HEARD WHATEVER IS ON THAT YOU CAN GET HURT RIDE YOUR BIKE
h04oX5qhBCY_19 0 IT'S PROBABLY NO DIFFERENT A LITTLE HIGHER RISK BUT YOU HAVE YOUR PRECAUTIONS YOU HAVE YOUR YOUR BOWL PROFESSED ON THINGS LIKE THAT
h04oX5qhBCY_20 0 IT'S NO WORSE THAN THE A WE'RE TRAIN THAT WHAT WE DO AND IT'S NOT WORST ANOTHER PROFESSIONS
h04oX5qhBCY_21 0 YOU CAN GET HURT AND SO IF THAT'S A BIG A ISSUED DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT IF YOU GET TRAINED IN THE THINGS AND A EVERYBODY'S THERE TO BACK EVERYBODY UP AND HOPEFULLY THEY NEVER GET HER BUT YOU CAN GET HURT ANY PROFESSION

GBrHWmc7YSE_2 0 IT'S SO MUCH TENSION WE HOLD IN OUR SHOULDERS AND ARMS
GBrHWmc7YSE_3 0 SO A COUPLE OF THE WAYS WE CAN DO THAT IS WE BEGIN WITH OUR ARMS LOOSELY BY THE SIDE

GBrHWmc7YSE_5 0 IT'S VERY LOOSE IT'S LIKE TRYING TO GET WATER OFF OF YOUR ARMS

gb0k8a2dHVo_1 0 WHEN CHOOSING A GLAZE FOR YOUR FINAL PIECE OF CERAMICS OR A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER
gb0k8a2dHVo_2 0 ONE OF THE THINGS ARE HOW YOUR COLORS ARE GOING TO INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER
gb0k8a2dHVo_3 0 FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU CHOOSE A GLAZE FOR THE INTERIOR AN EXTERIOR HOW THEY LOOK ONCE THEY'RE FINAL
gb0k8a2dHVo_4 0 SO WHEN YOU HAVE THE LID PIECE AND YOU OPEN IT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THESE TWO COLORS GO WELL TOGETHER
gb0k8a2dHVo_5 0 SO WHAT I DO IN MY STUDIO IS ALL USUALLY MARK ON THE SURFACE OF THE GLAZE IS I LIKE
gb0k8a2dHVo_6 0 I ALSO TRY TO SEE ORGANIZE AND PUT THEM IN ORDER
gb0k8a2dHVo_7 0 BUT I LIKE A LETTER EARTH TONES AND BLUES
gb0k8a2dHVo_8 0 I DO A LOT OF THE OCEAN INSPIRED OUR WORK SO A LOT OF MY COLORS COME FROM NATURE AND THE OCEANS AND THE WATERS AND SO THAT'S HOW I'VE DECIDED ON THESE
gb0k8a2dHVo_9 0 I'VE GOT THE NIGHT SKY DESERT WHICH IS JUST LIKE IT SAYS DOESN'T COLOR
gb0k8a2dHVo_10 0 THEY USUALLY PRETTY TRUE TO THE COLOR
gb0k8a2dHVo_11 0 WE FEEL IT'S LIKE A LIGHT BASE WHICH IS CLOSE TO THE OTHER ONE AND A TEAL BLUE
gb0k8a2dHVo_12 0 SO THESE ARE MY FAVORITE CHOICES
gb0k8a2dHVo_13 0 TESTERS IN YOUR STUDIO AGAIN ARE REALLY KEY
gb0k8a2dHVo_14 0 SO I'LL REFERENCE PIECES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN GLAZED WITH THESE COLORS TO HELP ME DECIDE AS WELL
gHdm6TMzeJU_1 0 IF THE PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH GUM DISEASE THERE'S A MULTITUDE OF WAYS TO TREAT THIS GUM DISEASE
gHdm6TMzeJU_2 0 THE TO THE MOST TYPICAL ONE THE DENSE FOR PRESCRIBER WHAT'S CALLED SCALING AND ROOT PLANNING ALSO KNOWN AS DEEP CLEANINGS
gHdm6TMzeJU_3 0 THE PURPOSE OF THE D CLINGS OR TO BASICALLY REMOVE ALL DEBRIS AND BUILD UP THAT OCCURS ABOVE AND BELOW THE GUM LINE AND THE TEA
gHdm6TMzeJU_4 0 WE KNOW THAT THAT IS ULTIMATELY THE PROBLEM WHICH WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO TO GET TO THE GUM DISEASE SUCH AS GINGER VYAS BONE LAST TEETH BEING LOST AND LOOSE
gHdm6TMzeJU_5 0 AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WHEN WE DO THESE DEEP CLEANINGS THAT WE GO IN THERE AND REMOVE ALL OF THE IRRITATING FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS GUM DISEASE
gHdm6TMzeJU_6 0 SO IN THIS MODEL WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF THIS TOO THIN ACTUALLY HAS GUM DISEASE AND WE CHARACTERIZE GUM DISEASE BY A COUPLE THINGS
gHdm6TMzeJU_7 0 ONE IS THAT WE HAVE LOTS OF BUILD UP OF DOWN RIGHT HERE AROUND THE GUM LINE
gHdm6TMzeJU_8 0 SECONDLY THE TISSUE IS VERY RED AND FLAMES IN TENDER AND ALSO BLEEDS A LITTLE BIT MORE FREQUENTLY THAN NORMAL
gHdm6TMzeJU_9 0 WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IT WHEN WE DO OUR D CLEANSES WERE REMOVING ALL OF THESE THIS BUILD UP AROUND THE TEETH
gHdm6TMzeJU_10 0 SO IN A TYPICAL APPOINTMENT PATIENT WILL COME IN THE DENTIST WILL NUMB THE PATIENT TO MAKE THEM COMFORTABLE
gHdm6TMzeJU_11 0 AND TYPICALLY THE HIGH GYMNAST WILL BE THE ONE THE PERFORMS THE DEEP CLEANINGS
gHdm6TMzeJU_12 0 IN A DEEP CLEANING WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS OR TAKING SEVERAL DIFFERENT CLEANING INSTRUMENTS AND PLACING IN ACROSS THE TOOTH WHERE THE BELL THAT DOESN'T REMOVING THE BELLOWS
gHdm6TMzeJU_13 0 SO HERE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THIS BUILD UP IT AS WE TAKE OUR INSTRUMENT THROUGH HERE WE'RE GOING TO GENTLY PULL SOME THIS MATERIAL OFF THE TOOTH JUST LIKE SO AND KIND OF US IN A LIGHT SCRAPING MOTION OR REMOVING ALL OF THIS BUILD UP AROUND THE TEETH
gHdm6TMzeJU_14 0 BY REMOVING THE BUILD UP THAT WILL HELP CURE THE GUM DISEASE AND GET THE TISSUE IN OR MORE STABLE UNCOMFORTABLE CONDITION LIKE SO
gHdm6TMzeJU_15 0 ONCE THE DEEP CLEANS OF BEEN COMPLETED WE WILL BASICALLY BRING THE PATIENT BACK ROUGHLY ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE WEEKS LATER AFTER THE TREATMENT IS BEEN COMPLETED AND WE WERE EVALUATE THE GUMS
gHdm6TMzeJU_16 0 THE THINGS THAT WE LOOK AT OUR THE TISSUE COLOR AS IT IS THE TISSUE NICE AND PINK OR IS IT STILL RED
gHdm6TMzeJU_17 0 IS IT NICE AND TIGHT OR IS IT INFLAMED SWOLLEN
gHdm6TMzeJU_18 0 AND HOW MUCH BLEEDING THAT WE HAVE
gHdm6TMzeJU_19 0 AS THE BLEEDING DECREASE SINCE WE INITIALLY EVALUATED
gHdm6TMzeJU_20 0 PROVIDED ALL THOSE THINGS HAVE OR IMPROVED RESPOND AND THAT IS THE FIRST STEPS IN TRAINING THE GUM DISEASE
gHdm6TMzeJU_21 0 ONCE WE'VE IDENTIFY THAT WE HAVE THAT IS STABLE CONDITION THE NEXT STEP IS TO GET THE PATIENT AND MORE FREQUENT RECALL INTERVAL WHETHER GETTING MORE FREQUENT CLEANINGS
gHdm6TMzeJU_22 0 THIS CAN BE IS AS MUCH AS EVERY THREE MONTHS TO AS LITTLE AS EVERY SIX MONTHS AND IT DEPENDS FROM PATIENT PATIENT BASED ON HOW MUCH TREATMENT WE THINK WILL BE NECESSARY
GiuaUeZM1fo_2 0 THIS IS A A TYPICAL CAMERA TROUT BOTTOM NORMALLY THEIR UNDER FIFTY DOLLARS
GiuaUeZM1fo_3 0 AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET THEM UNDER THIRTY DOLLARS
GiuaUeZM1fo_4 0 NOW THEY HAVE EASY TO DO RELEASE SO THAT YOU COULD LOCK THEM DOWN AT ANY LENGTH
GiuaUeZM1fo_5 0 IN THE PAST THAT HAD SORT OF SCREW MECHANISMS HERE WHICH WE'RE NOT QUICK AND NOT THAT EASY
GiuaUeZM1fo_6 0 BUT NOW THEY HAVE BETTER ONCE
GiuaUeZM1fo_7 0 AND THESE ARE GENERALLY MADE OF ALUMINUM
GiuaUeZM1fo_8 0 AND DEPENDING ON WHAT GRADE AND HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO SPIN YOU MAY GET THICKER ALUMINUM WHICH MAKES IT HEAVIER
GiuaUeZM1fo_9 0 THESE HAVE ROTATING CUPS ALL BALL JOINTS
GiuaUeZM1fo_10 0 SOME OF THEM HAVE A LITTLE SPIKES THAT WILL UNSCREW THROUGH THE FOOT
GiuaUeZM1fo_11 0 THIS ONE DOESN'T HAVE THAT
GiuaUeZM1fo_12 0 SO THAT IF YOU NEED TO BE ON THE CARPET YOU WILL HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SLIDING OR MOVING
GiuaUeZM1fo_13 0 THIS ONE HAS GOT A LOT OF FLUID HEAD BUT IT TRIES TO HAVE A FLUID HEAD
GiuaUeZM1fo_14 0 AND WITH JUST A STILL CAMERA UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO BE SHOOTING MOVIES THEN YOU REALLY DON'T NEED A FLUID HEAD

HAeg9nVrfz0_16 0 IF IT
gjduiJhT2o4_1 0 AGAIN I WANT TO GO OVER A FEW THINGS AS FAR AS EXCEEDING ARRANGEMENTS AND THE CANOE
gjduiJhT2o4_2 0 YOU ALWAYS WANT TO PUT YOUR PARTICIPANT ARE THE LEAST EXPERIENCE CAN NEWER AND THE VERY FRONT OF THE CANOE
gjduiJhT2o4_3 0 THE PERSON IN THE FRONT OF THE CANOE ACTS AS THE MOTOR
gjduiJhT2o4_4 0 NEXT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PARTICIPANT WITH THE DISABILITIES SIT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CANOE AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE AT A LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY IS LIKE POLISH
gjduiJhT2o4_5 0 AND EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE SEEN EXAMPLES OF OUR ADAPTIVE PADDLE WHEEL OR A IT ADAPTIVE GRIPS JUST BECAUSE THE ONES IN THE CANOE DOESN'T MEAN THEY ALSO HAVE TO BE PADDLING
gjduiJhT2o4_6 0 A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE JUST ENJOY THE EXPERIENCE OF GLIDING OVER THE WATER LOOKING AT THE SCENERY
gjduiJhT2o4_7 0 AND SO IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO ENGAGE YOUR PARTICIPANTS WITH THE PADDLE BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS NECESSARY AS LONG AS YOU HAVE YOUR MOTOR AND THE FRONT AND THEN ALSO I'M OUT OF THIS GROUP I'M THE MOST EXPERIENCE PADDLER SO I'M GOING TO BE IN THE BACK AND WHAT I PADDLE I'M USING THE DIFFERENCE TRICKS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AS FAR AS THE FORWARD STROKE BACKWARDS STROKING THE G A STROKE AND I'M ALSO MAYBE JUST LEAVING MY PADDLE BACK IN THE WATER AND PULLING IT IN AND OUT LIKE THIS AND THE WATER TO HELP STEER THE CANOE
gjduiJhT2o4_8 0 AND SO ALWAYS THINK ABOUT YOUR SEATING ARRANGEMENTS BEFORE YOU GO CANOEING
gjduiJhT2o4_9 0 ONE OTHER ISSUE WE COME ACROSS WHEN DOING ADAPTABLE ACCESSIBLE CANOEING IS SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME PARTICIPANTS THAT ARE OVERWEIGHT
gjduiJhT2o4_10 0 AND SO YOU WANT TO ADJUST YOUR WEIGHT AND THE CANOE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ALSO
gjduiJhT2o4_11 0 SO INSTEAD OF HAVING THE BALL BACK HERE WITH ME SOMETIMES WHAT WE MIGHT DO AS A POOL READJUST THIS C AND PUT IT RIGHT BEHIND BREALAND AND INSTEAD OF FACING FORWARD PAUL WITH THEN BE FACING ME
gjduiJhT2o4_12 0 THAT WAY I CAN GIVE VERBAL COMMANDS TO PAUSE FOR AS IF YOU HAVE TO SHIFT HIS WEIGHT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND IT'S ALSO AN EASIER WAY TO TALK BACK AND FORTH WITH SOMEONE WHILE YOU'RE CANOEING CAUSE YOU CAN BE FACE TO FACE

gkYaBjdyHCs_1 0 NOW I WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DECORATE THE BIG BEAD WITH SOME SPECIAL COLORS
gkYaBjdyHCs_2 0 I'M GOING TO BE USING A GOLD METALLIC MARKER
gkYaBjdyHCs_3 0 THE REASON WHY WE WANT TO DECORATE THIS SO THAT IT STANDS OUT A LITTLE MORE IS BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE THE LOWEST HANGING BEAD ON THE STRING AND IT'S GOING TO BE THE MOST VISIBLE BEAD
gkYaBjdyHCs_4 0 SO BEING THAT IT'S BIGGER AND IT'S HANGING LOWER PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT IT WILL CATCH THE I FIRST
gkYaBjdyHCs_5 0 WE WANT TO MAKE IT STAND OUT A LITTLE MORE MAKE IT LOOK A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIAL
gkYaBjdyHCs_6 0 THAT'S WHY I CHOSE TO USE THE METALLIC PAINT
gkYaBjdyHCs_7 0 IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE BRIGHTER AND THIS CAN BE DONE AFTER THE BEAD HAS BEEN TIE INTO THE STRING
gkYaBjdyHCs_8 0 AND THERE'S REALLY NO PROBLEM OF GETTING THE HANDS DIRTY AND THEN ONCE THIS IS DONE WE CAN GO AHEAD AND ADD THE OTHER BEADS TO THE STRING AND COMPLETE THE STRING OF BEADS FOR THE INSIDE OF THE BELL

GAzwixKTOBc_1 0 HI I'M MIKE LAIS
GAzwixKTOBc_2 0 AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE THIS IS PLAYING PIANO SEVENTH CHORDS
GAzwixKTOBc_3 0 SO NOW WE HAVE THE DOMINANT CHORD
GAzwixKTOBc_4 0 LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER INVERSIONS OF IT THAT WE CAN DO
GAzwixKTOBc_5 0 FOR EXAMPLE THE FIRST INVERSION WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HERE IS OUR WE SPELL OUT FROM THE THIRD OF THE CHORD THE AS OPPOSED TO THE ROOT OF THE CHORD
GAzwixKTOBc_6 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO GO HERE
GAzwixKTOBc_7 0 WE'LL TAKE OUR C DOMINANT SEVEN AGAIN WHICH IS ONE THREE FIVE FLAT SEVEN WE'RE GOING TO DO THE FIRST INVERSION OF THIS WHICH WE'RE BASICALLY STARTING OFF ON THE ROOT AND JUST TAKEN OR WORD STARTING OFF ON THE THIRD TAKING THE ROOT BRING THAT UP THE OCTAVE
GAzwixKTOBc_9 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO GO FIRST INVERSION SPELLED THREE FIVE FLAT SEVEN ONE
GAzwixKTOBc_10 0 JUST LIKE THAT
GAzwixKTOBc_11 0 THAT'S GOING TO BE YOUR FIRST INVERSION OF A DOMINANT SEVEN CHORD
Gq5mCJmXdco_1 0 HERE I'LL BE DISCUSSING THE DOING THAT
Gq5mCJmXdco_2 0 NOW THIS INSTRUMENT HAS MANY DIFFERENT NAMES THE DOOR BOOT GO BEING ANOTHER ONE OF THEM
Gq5mCJmXdco_3 0 BUT ESSENTIALLY THE CONSTRUCTION IS THE SAME
Gq5mCJmXdco_4 0 IT'S A MIDDLE EASTERN DRUM VERY COMMON IN ETHIOPIA IN EGYPT
Gq5mCJmXdco_5 0 BUT THE UPPER EDGE CHANGES SO IN SOME OF LIKE EASTERN YOUR COUNTRIES OR IN TURKEY FOR EXAMPLE THE RIM WILL BE METAL
Gq5mCJmXdco_6 0 RATHER THAN THE JUNCTION VERSION OF THIS WHICH WILL HAVE A CURVED EDGE
Gq5mCJmXdco_7 0 CREATING A DIFFERENT SOUND AS YOU APPROACH THE EDGE OF THE SKIN OF THE INSTRUMENT
Gq5mCJmXdco_8 0 THE SKIN FIZZ WHAT'S PULL TIGHT ACROSS HERE
Gq5mCJmXdco_9 0 OFTEN MAYBE THE ANIMAL SKIN ESPECIALLY BEFORE THEY HAD SYNTHETIC SKINS HERE
Gq5mCJmXdco_10 0 THIS CASE IS METAL
Gq5mCJmXdco_11 0 SOMETIMES IT WILL BE CERAMIC OR CLAY EVEN
Gq5mCJmXdco_12 0 NOW THE BOTTOM IS HOLLOW AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS NOT ONLY TO LET THE SOUND COME OUT OF THE INSTRUMENT BUT AS YOU STRIKE THE INSTRUMENT IF YOU INSERT YOUR HAND INTO THE BOTTOM YOU CAN CHANGE THE TONE OF THE DRUM
Gq5mCJmXdco_13 0 SO IF YOU NOTICE IT GETS LOWER AS I BRING THE HAND IN THERE CHANGING THE FREQUENCY OF THE SOUND COMING OUT
Gq5mCJmXdco_14 0 NOW THE NAME DOOM BACK ESSENTIALLY COMES FROM THE TWO SOUNDS YOU CAN GET FROM INSTRUMENT
Gq5mCJmXdco_15 0 DOOM WHICH IS THE WHEN YOU HIT IN THE CENTER OF THE INSTRUMENT HERE KIND OF A LOW SOUND
Gq5mCJmXdco_16 0 AN ATTACK OR BACK IN THIS CASE WHEN YOU'RE HITTING THE EDGE OF THE RIM EDGE OF THE SKIN TO GET THAT VERY CRISP SOUND
GaHNvEqJyF4_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SAKE DIVING DISTANCE BETWEEN OTHER AUTOMOBILES AND INCLEMENT WEATHER YOU WANT TO STAY AT LEAST TWO VEHICLES OR A VEHICLE IN THE HAVE BEHIND THE OTHER CAR AHEAD OF YOU
GaHNvEqJyF4_2 0 IN THE EVENT THAT HE DOES SOMETHING A RAG YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO STOP
GaHNvEqJyF4_3 0 AND DURING INCLEMENT WEATHER SUCH AS RANGE SNOW SLIDERS SO ON PEEL THESE FIVE MILES BELOW THE REGULAR SPEED LIMIT
GaHNvEqJyF4_4 0 THIS WILL HELP YOU STOP YOUR VEHICLE IN TIME TO PREVENT HOPEFULLY AN ACCIDENT
GaHNvEqJyF4_5 0 I'M DRYER PAVEMENT YOU MAY SNEAK YOUR VEHICLE UP AND YOU MAY DRIVE APPROXIMATELY THIS FAR FROM THE OTHER VEHICLE WHICH IS A CAR LENGTH
GaHNvEqJyF4_6 0 A GOOD CAR LENGTH AND A QUARTER FROM THE OTHER VEHICLE WILL GIVE YOU AMPLE STOPPING TIME
GaHNvEqJyF4_7 0 NOW IN THE EVENT THAT THAT AUTOMOBILE AHEAD OF US COMES UP OUT OF THE NEXT IT ANY COMES TO A STOP SIGN OR IT COMES TO A RED LIGHT WHEN YOU DRIVE A BEHIND THIS VEHICLE DON'T COME UP TO HIM RIGHT ON HIS BUMPER STAY BACK AS FAR AS YOU WHEN YOU CAN SET IN A COMFORTABLE POSITION AND LOOK AND SEE THE BANDS OR WOMENS TIRES ON THE GROUND
GaHNvEqJyF4_8 0 THIS IS AMPLE SPACE FOR YOU TO DO AT A STOP SIGN OR A RED LIGHT IN THE EVENT OR THE DOES STOP IT GIVES YOUR PLENTY OF TIME TO STOP AND KEEPS YOU A SAFE DISTANCE IN THE EVENT OF A BACK IN RELATION

gLdzfAhxxMw_3 0 BECAUSE I SPACES IN AUSTRALIA AFRICA SOUTH AMERICA NORTH AMERICA SHOW
gLdzfAhxxMw_4 0 THEY MAKE EXCELLENT AVIARY BIRDS BECAUSE YOU GET TWENTY OR THIRTY OF THEM TOGETHER AND THEY MAKE THEY WILL SPEND ALL DAY SEE
gLdzfAhxxMw_5 0 THEN JUST COLORS RANGE FROM WHITE TO PURPLE TO BROWN
gLdzfAhxxMw_6 0 THERE'S HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF PITCHES AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES
gLdzfAhxxMw_7 0 MOST FINCHES ARE VERY EASY TO DETERMINE THE MALE AND FEMALE
gLdzfAhxxMw_8 0 FEMALES USUALLY ARE SMALL OR BROWN LIGHT COLORED AND THE MALES HAVE ALL THE COLORS
gLdzfAhxxMw_9 0 THIS IS A FEMALE PIN TELL WHY DOES
gLdzfAhxxMw_10 0 THIS BIRD IS FOUND GENERALLY IN SOUTHERN AMERICA AND MEXICO
gLdzfAhxxMw_11 0 THE MALE OF THE SPECIES IS WHITE WITH BLACK TIPS
gLdzfAhxxMw_12 0 THEY HAVE TAIL FEATHERS THEY GROW UP TO TWELVE INCHES LONG
gzXKGlJfYYc_1 0 ALRIGHT SO I'M GOING TO BE TELLING YOU WHAT AN OLLIE IS
gzXKGlJfYYc_2 0 SNOWBOARDING IS PRETTY MUCH JUST HAVING BOARD CONTROL
gzXKGlJfYYc_3 0 AFTER YOU'VE TAKEN A FEW RUNS DOWN THE MOUNTAIN TIMES TAKEN CARDS KNOW YOUR EDGES
gzXKGlJfYYc_4 0 YOU GET THE FEEL FOR YOUR SNOWBOARD
gzXKGlJfYYc_5 0 YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO WANT TO POP
gzXKGlJfYYc_6 0 YOU WANT TO GET UP OFF THE LITTLE BUMPS AND GET OVER THINGS AND JUMP ON THE BOX AND STUFF
gzXKGlJfYYc_7 0 SO THAT FIRST STEP OF TAKING THOSE TO THE NEXT LEVEL IS AN OLLIE
gzXKGlJfYYc_8 0 AN OLLIE IS PRETTY MUCH WHERE YOUR WEIGHT IS JUST ON YOUR BACK FOOT
gzXKGlJfYYc_9 0 YOU CAN START OFF ON FLAT GROUND
gzXKGlJfYYc_10 0 JUST LIKE THIS
gzXKGlJfYYc_11 0 YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR BACK FOOT UP AND THAT'S IT
gzXKGlJfYYc_12 0 IT'S LIKE THIS
gzXKGlJfYYc_13 0 YOU COULD DO THIS ON FLAT GROUND HUNDRED TIMES
gzXKGlJfYYc_14 0 IT JUST GETS YOU BETTER AND BETTER AT YOUR BOARD CONTROL
gzXKGlJfYYc_15 0 THE NEXT STEP YOU WANT TO TAKE IT UP THE MOUNTAIN AND TRY IT GOING DOWN A LITTLE SLOW
gzXKGlJfYYc_16 0 AND ONCE YOU'RE IN THE SLOPE YOU'RE GOING DOWN HILL ALREADY SO IT'S EASY TO POP UNDER YOUR TAIL AND JUST LIFT THAT FRONT FOOT UP AND GET IT A LITTLE FLAT BASED
gzXKGlJfYYc_17 0 BACK DOWN TO THE GROUND
gzXKGlJfYYc_18 0 IT'S WHAT AN OLLIE ISN'T SNOWBOARDING
h5Tc0QPiB_o_1 0 HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
h5Tc0QPiB_o_2 0 WE'RE WORKING HERE WITH OUR RUNNING BACKS IN THE PROPER WAY TO TAKE A HAND OFF
h5Tc0QPiB_o_3 0 NOW YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU TAKE THE HAND OFF IN THE PROPER WAY FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS
h5Tc0QPiB_o_4 0 ONE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE RIGHT OF WEIGHT TO WRAP UP THE BALL IF YOU TAKE THE THE HAND OFF IN THE WRONG WAY
h5Tc0QPiB_o_5 0 THE SECOND WAY IS GOING TO BE HARD FOR THE QUARTERBACK TO GIVE YOU THE BALL IF YOU'RE NOT OPENED UP THE PROPER WAY
h5Tc0QPiB_o_6 0 IF YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS REVERSED AND HE'S TRYING TO GIVE YOU A HAND OFF ON THE WRONG SIDE AND YOU GOT YOUR ELBOW OUT THERE CHANCES ARE YOU'RE GOING TO HIT WITH YOUR ARM AND YOU'RE GOING TO KNOCK THE BALL LOOSE FROM THE QUARTERBACK
h5Tc0QPiB_o_7 0 SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN A RUNNING BACK COMES THROUGH FIRST OF ALL HE WANTS TO BE LOW HE WANTS TO BE OPEN IN READY WITH HIS INSIDE HAND TO THE QUARTERBACK
h5Tc0QPiB_o_8 0 HIS INSIDE ARM HAS TO BE OPEN NOT DOWN
h5Tc0QPiB_o_9 0 IT'S GOT TO BE OPEN SO THE QUARTERBACK AND SLIDE THE BALL IN
h5Tc0QPiB_o_10 0 ONCE THE BALL GOES INSIDE HE WANTS TO WRAP THE BALL UP TIGHT COVER IT WITH BOTH TIPS OVER THE BALL
h5Tc0QPiB_o_11 0 AND IT'S GOING TO LOOK A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS JUST WALK THROUGH
h5Tc0QPiB_o_12 0 DO IT THAT BUT QUARTERBACK AND OPEN UP HE'S TAKING IT LOW YOU CAN SEE IS COVERED UP OF BOTH TIPS AND HE'S STILL STAY LOW AND STAYING FORWARD AS HE COMES THROUGH
h5Tc0QPiB_o_13 0 SO REMEMBER WE'RE TAKING THE HAND OFF YOU DON'T TAKE THE HAND OFF WITH YOUR HANDS DOWN LOW
h5Tc0QPiB_o_14 0 YOU'RE GOING TO OPEN UP INSIDE ARM IS OPEN THE BALL'S GOING TO GO IN YOU'RE GOING TO COVER THE BALL WITH BOTH TIPS AND HOLD ONTO IT TIGHT STAIN LOW IN ORDER TO EXPLODE THROUGH THE HOLE
HbVG129GEag_1 0 NOW I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT TO DO IF YOU'RE IN A PINCH AND YOU NEED TO SUBSTITUTE ONE I'LL CALL FOR ANOTHER
HbVG129GEag_2 0 SAY YOU'RE WORKING ON A BAR AND YOU RUN OUT OF VODKA AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT OF VODKA THAT NIGHT
HbVG129GEag_3 0 IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO GET AND YOU KNOW YOU REALLY NEED IT TO MAKE THE DRINKS ON ONE THING ONE ALCOHOL YOU CAN SUBSTITUTE WOULD BE JEN
HbVG129GEag_4 0 IT'S NOT EXACTLY THE SAME BUT IT DOES HAVE SIMILAR TENDENCIES IN A LOT OF THE DRINK SO YOU MAKE WITH THOUGHT CUT YOU CAN ALSO MAKE WITH GIN AND VICE VERSA
HbVG129GEag_5 0 SOMETIMES YOU PROBABLY WANT TO JUST AVOID MAKING THOUGH IS IF YOU IF SOMEONE ASK FOR A GIN MARTINI MIGHT JUST WANT TO LET HIM KNOW WE DON'T OF GENERAL I CAN MAKE YOUR LOCKED MARTINI ONLY BECAUSE THEY'LL NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE IN A DRINK LIKE THAT
HbVG129GEag_6 0 BUT IF IT'S A MIX STRENGTH ON MOST LIKELY THESE TWO ARE PRETTY EXCHANGEABLE
HbVG129GEag_7 0 IT WON'T TASTE EXACTLY LIKE BUT IT WILL BE ENOUGH ON THE DRIBBLE STILL TASTE GOOD
HbVG129GEag_8 0 ON THE NEXT THING WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS TEQUILA AND RUM
HbVG129GEag_9 0 THESE TO THE SAME THING
HbVG129GEag_10 0 IF YOU RUN OUT OF EITHER TEQUILA OR RUM AND MAJORITY OF DRINKS YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SUBSTRATE ONE FOR THE OTHER
HbVG129GEag_11 0 THESE BOTH BOTH OF THESE ARE TEND TO BE USED IN MORE OF TROPICAL DRINKS OR A CARIBBEAN TYPE DRINKS AND AGAIN IF IT'S MIXED WITH A LOT OF SEVERAL OTHER INGREDIENTS YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO NOTICE THE TASTE THAT MUCH
HbVG129GEag_12 0 I'M GOING TO USE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT MORE AND MORE THAN NOT IT'LL IT'LL TASTE OKAY
HbVG129GEag_13 0 ON THE NEXT TWO I HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE BUT I'M JUST GOING TO SAY IT AGAIN IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE IS ON AND THAT YOU CAN USE THINGS LIKE TRIPLE SEC AND THE COURSE OF THE SAME
HbVG129GEag_14 0 ALSO COINTREAU IS THE SAME AND GRAND MARNIER
HbVG129GEag_15 0 ON THE OTHER TWO ARE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER SCALE AND THESE ARE A LITTLE BIT LOWER SCALE BUT YOU CAN SO THEY'LL CHEAPER SO IF YOU DON'T HURT YOUR WALLET TOO MUCH YOU CAN ALWAYS GET SOME OF THESE
HbVG129GEag_16 0 AGAIN RAZZMATAZZ SLOE GIN AND SHAM BOARD YOU CAN ALL EXCHANGE FOR EACH OTHER IF YOU NEED TO IN A PINCH
HbVG129GEag_17 0 AND I JUST WANTED TO MENTION REAL QUICK THESE ARE TWO THINGS YOU REALLY NEVER CAN EXCHANGE AND SOME PEOPLE TEND TO THINK YOU CAN
HbVG129GEag_18 0 TONIC WATER AND CLUB SODA TASTE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT SO YOU JUST WANT TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO DO THAT
HbVG129GEag_19 0 ON TONIC WATER DOESN'T CALORIES
HbVG129GEag_20 0 SO TO WATER ON THE OTHER HAND HAS SALT IN IT SO IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT SALTY IT DOES HAVE CALORIES
HbVG129GEag_21 0 I'M AND THE LAST THING YOU DON'T WANT EXCHANGES SCOTCH WITHOUT ANY OTHER WHISKEY
HbVG129GEag_22 0 YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW YOUR DIFFERENCE BUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE BECAUSE SCOTCH CAMP EXCHANGE WITH ANY OTHER WHISK
HbVG129GEag_23 0 IT'S GOT A VERY DISTINCT FLAVOR
HbVG129GEag_24 0 AND THESE ARE OF ALCOHOL SUBSTITUTIONS

hAZ1s7unT5g_1 0 HI MY NAME IS REBECCA AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO BECOME A FASHION DESIGNER
hAZ1s7unT5g_2 0 THERE ARE TWO OUTS TO DOING IT
hAZ1s7unT5g_3 0 THE FIRST ONE QUITE OBVIOUSLY IS TO STUDY FASHION DESIGN IN A SCHOOL THAT HAS THAT IS A DISCIPLINE
hAZ1s7unT5g_4 0 THE OTHER WAY WORKS FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TO
hAZ1s7unT5g_5 0 IT IS TO JUST START
hAZ1s7unT5g_6 0 ONE WAY IS JUST TO GET ANY JOB IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY
hAZ1s7unT5g_7 0 YOU COULD BE MANAGING THE SAMPLE ROOM FOR OF FASHION HOUSE OR EVEN A SMALLER BRAND
hAZ1s7unT5g_8 0 OR YOU COULD BE AN ASSISTANT TO A DESIGNER SO WHILE YOU MIGHT NOT BE DOING FASHION STUFF YOU RE LEARNING ALL ABOUT THE FASHION INDUSTRY
hAZ1s7unT5g_9 0 THE OTHER WAY IS TO JUST START YOUR OWN COMPANY
hAZ1s7unT5g_10 0 YES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BUT IF YOU FOCUS ON VERY VERY LIMITED ITEMS IN THE BEGINNING MAYBE FIVE OR LESS AND JUST MAKE THAT WORK YOU CAN GROW A COMPANY FROM THERE
hAZ1s7unT5g_11 0 ANOTHER THING TO DO TO GET EXPERIENCE WHETHER YOU'RE ENTERING THE FIELD JUST OUT OF STUDYING OR IT WITH THE YOU WANT TO ADVANCE FROM SOMETHING LIKE A DESIGN ASSISTANT INTO A MORE RESPONSIBLE AND CREATIVE POSITION IS TO DO PROJECTS FOR COMPANIES
hAZ1s7unT5g_12 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ON FULL TIME
hAZ1s7unT5g_13 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PAID
hAZ1s7unT5g_14 0 YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND COMPANIES THAT ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU AND PROJECTS YOU LIKE TO DO IN ORDER TO RAISE YOUR EXPERIENCE LEVEL
hAZ1s7unT5g_15 0 ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING IN BECOMING A FASHION DESIGNER IS TO ALWAYS BE DEVELOPING IMPROVING YOUR SKILL LEVEL
hAZ1s7unT5g_16 0 THAT MEANS KNOWING ALL THE LATEST PROGRAMS ON THE COMPUTER AS WELL AS HAVING THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO DO THIS SELLING IN THE PATTERN MAKING EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE DOING THAT IN THE WOOD FLOORS
hAZ1s7unT5g_17 0 SO THOSE ARE A FEW THINGS TO THINK ABOUT WHEN CHOOSING A CAREER IN FASHION DESIGN

-hANPiHEiXA_2 0 PATIENTS THAT COME IN PAIN USUALLY PRETTY QUICKLY SOMETIMES EVEN IF THEY ARE FIRST IS IT WHETHER REDUCTION THEIR PAIN LEVELS
-hANPiHEiXA_3 0 ADDITIONALLY IN A SHORT TERM WE'RE LOOKING FOR RESPONSES THAT ARE IMPROVED MOBILITY THAT HAD A LACK OF CERTAIN RANGE IS A MOTION WE GET THAT STUFF SQUARED AWAY ON IT BETTER FLEXIBILITY SOME PEOPLE RESPOND MESSING WITH THEIR FEELING A LIGHTER ON THEIR FEET

hBIGDm-BdbI_1 0 SO HE IS NOW GOING TO BE DEMONSTRATING SORT OF A SWING TO THE SIDE
hBIGDm-BdbI_2 0 THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER ABOUT THIS IS YOU'RE GOING TO BE ATTACKING THE GROIN MUSCLES THIS SWINGLE
hBIGDm-BdbI_3 0 THAT IS GOING TO REALLY IMPORTANT YOU FIRST START IT'S KIND OF STRETCHING THAT YOU ARE VERY CAREFUL WITH IT
hBIGDm-BdbI_4 0 BECAUSE IF YOUR GROIN MUSCLES ARE USED TO IT JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T STRAIN THE BALL
hBIGDm-BdbI_5 0 THIS IS GOING TO PUT THIS HAND IT TO BE A TARGET FOR HIS
hBIGDm-BdbI_6 0 OKAY AND IT'S GOING TO JUST SWING THIS LEG UP STRAIGHT
hBIGDm-BdbI_7 0 IT'S GOING TO START USING AT FIRST
hBIGDm-BdbI_8 0 OR BRING ENOUGH TAP AND COME BACK DOWN
hBIGDm-BdbI_9 0 IT'S IMPORTANT TO START WITH YOUR GOLDSBY LOW AND THE KIND OF WORK YOUR WAY HIGHER AND HIGHER DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN DO
hBIGDm-BdbI_10 0 WE'RE GOING TO KEEP GOING
hBIGDm-BdbI_11 0 AND AS WE DID FOR OUR FRONT EFFECTS YOU DO ABOUT A SET OF FIFTEEN
hBIGDm-BdbI_12 0 YOU'RE ASKING WE'RE MUSCLE GROUP MUSCLES ON THE SIDES TO LIFT THE LEG OUT AND MORE DIFFICULT POSITION
hBIGDm-BdbI_13 0 WE'RE GOING TO ABBREVIATE THIS A LITTLE BIT
hBIGDm-BdbI_14 0 GOING THE OTHER SIDE
hBIGDm-BdbI_15 0 FIRST YOU NEED TO FIFTEEN
hBIGDm-BdbI_17 0 AND JUST SWING LAYER
hBIGDm-BdbI_18 0 AND AGAIN THIS ARE SLIGHTLY MORE NATURAL WAY TO PUT THE MUSCLES LIKE YOU WOULD REALLY APPLY THEM FOR IT TO BE REAL PSYCHICS INDUSTRY
hBIGDm-BdbI_19 0 LET ME PERSONALLY I USUALLY TRY TO DO THREE SETS OF THESE
hBIGDm-BdbI_20 0 SOMETIMES IF I NEED TO ALSO IT'S BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE FRONT KICKS INSIDE KICKS
hBIGDm-BdbI_21 0 SOMETIMES THEY'LL STICK WITH ONE FOR A WHILE
hBIGDm-BdbI_22 0 THE NEXT ONE IS GOING TO DO IT GOING TURN SIDEWAYS IF YOU HAVE TO STRETCH OUT THE QUADS MUSCLES ON THE FRONT LEG
hBIGDm-BdbI_23 0 SO WHAT IS GOING TO DO IS GOING TO STEP IS RIGHT FOOT FORWARD AND IS GOING TO SWING IS LIKE BACK TURN KICK YOURSELF IN THE REAR AND WITH THIS HEEL

G55W2Zl2sxw_1 0 IN CHINESE MEDICINE BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT FLAVORS AND HOW THEY ASSOCIATE WITH THE ORGANS AND SWEET BEING THE MAIN FLAVOR THAT AFFECTS THE ENERGETIC SPLEEN IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW SWEETENERS MAY AFFECT
G55W2Zl2sxw_2 0 SO WE DON'T WANT TOO MUCH TOO STRONG AND WE DON'T WANT TO LITTLE OF ANYTHING
G55W2Zl2sxw_3 0 SO WE TALK ABOUT NATURAL SWEETENERS AND WHAT MAY BE THE BEST
G55W2Zl2sxw_4 0 IN ACTUALITY IN CHINESE MEDICINE ANYTHING THAT'S EXTRACTED INTENSIFIED IN SWEETNESS REALLY ISN'T THE BEST THING FOR US
G55W2Zl2sxw_5 0 SO THERE'S DEBATE AS TO WHETHER THE BROWN SUGAR OR THE WHITE SUGAR OR WHETHER THAT THE CACTUS SUGAR OR EVEN OF THE ARTIFICIAL SO ARE THE NATURAL SWEETENERS LIKE STADIA HOW THEY MAY AFFECT US
G55W2Zl2sxw_6 0 ULTIMATELY IF THEY ARE VERY VERY SWEET AND EVEN MORE SWEEPING SUGAR WE FIND THAT IT'S DETRIMENTAL OVER TIME
G55W2Zl2sxw_7 0 SO FROM THE CHINESE PERSPECTIVE WE WANT TO MINIMIZE ARE SWEETENERS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO OVER WILL REACT ON THE SPLEEN CAUSING A DYSFUNCTION OF THE CHEEK AND ULTIMATELY HURTING ARE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND OUR DIGESTIVE FUNCTION
G55W2Zl2sxw_8 0 BUT FOR MORE PRACTICAL STANDPOINT WE DO LIKE OUR SWEETENERS AND SO IN GENERAL I RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE YOU STAY VIA IN PARTICULAR FROM A NATURAL PERSPECTIVE GROW THE PLANT YOURSELF AND USE THE FRESH LEAF
G55W2Zl2sxw_9 0 THE MORE THAT WE EXTRACT THINGS MORE WE REFINED THEM THE LESS NUTRIENTS AND THE GREATER THE POTENTIAL FOR HARM BOTH FROM AN ENERGETIC PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS A TRUE PERSPECTIVE OF EXTRACTED CHEMICALS

G4p6QqGMUkA_5 0 I WORK WITH COLLAGING LIGHTS
G4p6QqGMUkA_6 0 SO I GO REALLY FOCUS DOWN WITH THE LIGHT
G4p6QqGMUkA_7 0 AND THERE IS A PRODUCT THAT I USUALLY PUT ON THAT MAKES THOSE HAIRS
G4p6QqGMUkA_8 0 IT'S CALLED POUR MARKER
G4p6QqGMUkA_9 0 AND I'LL PUT THAT
G4p6QqGMUkA_10 0 I DID BRING IT WITH ME TODAY

G4p6QqGMUkA_23 0 SO WHEN IT COMES TO THAT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO TREAT THIRTY MINUTES HERE AND THEN I'M GOING TO TREAT THIRTY MINUTES HERE
G4p6QqGMUkA_24 0 USUALLY THIS IS KIND OF LIKE A CLOCK AS WELL
G4p6QqGMUkA_25 0 THE HAIRS WILL COME HERE AND THEN GO UP AND THEN GROW THIS WAY
G4p6QqGMUkA_26 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO BECOME AN IN LIKE SO AROUND
G4p6QqGMUkA_27 0 BUT WHEN IT COMES TO A REAL HAIRY BACK AT THE SAME THING AS I SPOKE UP BEFORE
G4p6QqGMUkA_28 0 I'VE ALL ASSESS IT AND THEN I'LL DO RECOMMENDATIONS WITH THE CLIENT
h0HsjGpBr8s_2 0 MY NAME IS YOLANDA VANVEEN AND IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO LEARN ALL ABOUT HOW TO BECOME A MASTER GARDENER
h0HsjGpBr8s_3 0 I BECAME A MASTER GARDENER IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR AND IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING AND ENTERTAINING AND ALSO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT I THINK OF EVER EXPERIENCE
h0HsjGpBr8s_4 0 AND NOT ONLY WAS IT FUN TO LEARN ABOUT THE PLANTS I LEARNED SO MUCH MORE
h0HsjGpBr8s_5 0 I LEARNED ALL ABOUT BUGS AND TREES AND SOILS AND TRANSPLANTING AND IT WAS JUST REALLY A REALLY EXCITING EXPERIENCE
h0HsjGpBr8s_6 0 NOW HOW DO YOU BECOME A MASTER GARDEN
h0HsjGpBr8s_7 0 PEOPLE ASK ME ALL THE TIME
h0HsjGpBr8s_8 0 IT'S REALLY EASY
h0HsjGpBr8s_9 0 SO I TEND TO THE GARDEN SHOW AND THEY WERE SEMESTER GARDEN OR SOMETHING WHERE THE BOOTH AND THEY HAVE SOME FLYERS ON HOW TO BECOME A MASTER GARDENER
h0HsjGpBr8s_10 0 SO THE MASTER GARDENING PROGRAM IS SPONSORED BY YOUR LOCAL STATE EXTENSION SERVICE
h0HsjGpBr8s_11 0 SO THE WASHINGTON STAY PROGRAM IS RUN THROUGH THE WASHED IN STATE UNIVERSITY CO-OPERATIVE EXTENSION
h0HsjGpBr8s_12 0 AND SO THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OR YOU CAN GO TO THE LOCAL STATE UNIVERSITY AND ASK AROUND OR JUST GOOGLE YOUR COUNTY AND MASTER GARDENERS AND USUALLY INFORMATIONAL COME RIGHT UP
h0HsjGpBr8s_13 0 THE PROGRAMS ARE USUALLY HELD ONCE A YEAR OR A ONCE EVERY TWO YEARS
h0HsjGpBr8s_14 0 AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE OF THE TIME COMMITMENT BUT IT REALLY WASN'T THAT BAD
h0HsjGpBr8s_15 0 IT WAS JUST ONCE A WEEK ONE DAY
h0HsjGpBr8s_16 0 MY PROGRAM WAS ON THURSDAYS
h0HsjGpBr8s_17 0 SOME ARE ON SATURDAYS
h0HsjGpBr8s_18 0 AND YOU'RE IN CLASS IS JUST LIKE GOING TO COLLEGE FROM ABOUT NINE TO THREE OR FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON
h0HsjGpBr8s_19 0 AND EACH DAY YOU LEARN ALL DIFFERENT SUBJECTS
h0HsjGpBr8s_20 0 AND YOU'RE ON A SET SCHEDULE AND YOU HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE COME IN SPEAK TO YOU AND IT'S VERY VERY INTERESTING
h0HsjGpBr8s_21 0 THE CLASSES WERE FOR ONLY GOT TWO TO THREE MONTHS SO IT REALLY WASN'T A LOT OF CLASSES IN THE END
h0HsjGpBr8s_22 0 AND ONCE YOU FINISH YOUR CLASSES YOU GET CERTIFIED AND THEN YOU CAN REPRESENTS THE WASH MISTING UNIVERSITY MASTER GARDENING PROGRAM AT DIFFERENT FARMERS MARKET SEND IN THE EXTENSION SERVICE OFFICES
h0HsjGpBr8s_23 0 SO THE MAIN REASON THAT THESE ARE THE WHOLE PROGRAM IN WASHED AND STATE WAS SO THAT THE EXTENSION SERVICE THE DEPARTMENT OF THAT CAN HELP HELP BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE CALL HIM WITH GARDENING QUESTIONS
h0HsjGpBr8s_24 0 AND SO THE SET UP THE MASTER BURNING PROGRAM SO THAT PEOPLE CAN VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME AND HELP OTHERS
h0HsjGpBr8s_25 0 AND IT WORKS OUT FOR EVERYONE
h0HsjGpBr8s_26 0 THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT I LEARNED WAS HOW TO RESEARCH INFORMATION BECAUSE THERE'S REALLY NO RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWERS WHEN THEY'RE COMES WHEN THERE'S GARDENING QUESTIONS
h0HsjGpBr8s_27 0 SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES
h0HsjGpBr8s_28 0 AND SO THERE IS A SET MANUAL THAT THEY PROVIDE FOR YOU THAT I REFER TO ALL THE TIME
h0HsjGpBr8s_29 0 IN THE PROGRAM IS JUST LIKE COLLEGE
h0HsjGpBr8s_30 0 AND YOU JUST GO THROUGH EACH OF THE SUBJECT
h0HsjGpBr8s_31 0 IT'S LIKE A MINI HORTICULTURAL DEGREE
h0HsjGpBr8s_32 0 AND BY THE BASIC SOILS AND FERTILIZERS PLANT PROPAGATION PRUNING WHICH I REALLY REFER TO
h0HsjGpBr8s_33 0 AND ALL TYPES OF OTHER INFORMATION
h0HsjGpBr8s_34 0 HOW TO PLANT BULBS
h0HsjGpBr8s_35 0 HOW TO TAKE YOUR VARIES BUGS ETYMOLOGY WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON BUGS BECAUSE THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF GARDENING IS TO UNDERSTANDING HOW TO DEAL WITH THE WALL LIVE AROUND YOU
h0HsjGpBr8s_36 0 IT'S MUCH EASIER THAN COLLEGE TOO
h0HsjGpBr8s_37 0 I WAS REALLY FEEL TO FIND OUT THERE'S NO TESTS IN CLASS
h0HsjGpBr8s_38 0 YOU JUST TAKE YOUR ANIMAL HOME AND YOU HAVE A LIST OF QUESTIONS EACH WEEK AND YOU CAN REFER TO YOUR BOOK BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE LEARNING
h0HsjGpBr8s_39 0 YOU'RE LEARNING HOW TO DO RESEARCH WHICH I REALLY THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF LEARNING IS LEARNING TO FROM OTHERS
h0HsjGpBr8s_40 0 AND SO YOU JUST RIGHT EXACTLY WHERE YOU GOT YOUR REFERENCE AND WHAT YOUR ANSWER IS AND THEN YOU TURN THE PAPERWORK IN AND THEN THEY GIVE THE BACK HERE
h0HsjGpBr8s_41 0 AND THE BEST PART IS IS WHEN YOU GET A HIGHLY FACEBOOK AND ALL OF THE QUESTIONS RIGHT
h0HsjGpBr8s_42 0 ONCE YOU GRADUATE FROM THE MASTER GARDENER DEGREE PROGRAM THEN YOU NEED TO PUT IN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS IN VOLUNTEERING
h0HsjGpBr8s_43 0 SO YOU CAN VOLUNTEER AT THE CLINIC OR TEACHING OTHERS ABOUT GARDENING OR IN THE LOCAL SCHOOLS OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO
h0HsjGpBr8s_44 0 THEY HAVE ALL TYPES OF PROGRAMS
h0HsjGpBr8s_45 0 AND ONCE YOU HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS AND YOU GET YOUR BATCH
h0HsjGpBr8s_46 0 TO KEEP YOUR BAGS AND TO REPRESENT THE MASTER GARDENERS YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP YOUR VOLUNTEER TIME AND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT'S HARD
h0HsjGpBr8s_47 0 BUT IT IS SO REWARDING TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE HELPING OTHERS AND IT IS A REALLY GOOD USE OF YOUR TIME
h0HsjGpBr8s_48 0 AND IT'S GREAT TO KNOW ABOUT GARDENING AND THE SHIRT WITH OTHERS

GUpnR4Flyw0_8 0 AND IF YOU NOTICE THAT YOU CAN SEE THIS TEXTURE IT'S KIND OF A DEEPLY RECESSED
GUpnR4Flyw0_9 0 KIND OF SCRAPING LINE EFFECT IN THE GLASS
GUpnR4Flyw0_10 0 THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING AGAIN THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOUR FLOWER PETALS OR A WATER OR SKY SCENE
GUpnR4Flyw0_11 0 SO THIS IS YOUR OUR TEETH
GUpnR4Flyw0_12 0 NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH ANTIQUE

GVU_CndU8qU_9 0 IT WILL LOOK MORE LIKE A FLOWER WHEN IT'S ALL COMPLETE EMERALD

GLGjRo02g90_4 0 AND JUST TO COVER IT UP TO COVER UP THE RUBBER BAND JUST TO GIVE IT SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND ADD JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE BODY TO IT WHEN YOU WRAP IT AROUND YOUR HAIR
GLGjRo02g90_5 0 THIS ONE IS MORE FAMILIAR TO A REGULAR SCRUNCHIE THAT YOU WOULD FIND IN THE STORE BECAUSE IT'S GOT A SCRUNCH OF YARN LIKE THIS
GLGjRo02g90_6 0 WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING THESE YOU CAN SCRUNCH THEM UP AS LITTLE OR AS MUCH AS YOU WANT AND YOU CAN MAKE THEM AS BIG AS YOU WANT
GLGjRo02g90_7 0 YOU'LL SEE LATER THAT WE'RE GOING TO ADD MORE TO THESE
GLGjRo02g90_8 0 NOW WHEN YOU'RE USING THESE RUBBER BANDS YOU CAN USE WHATEVER WITH YOU LIKE
GLGjRo02g90_9 0 I DON'T RECOMMEND THESE SO MUCH A THICKER ONE IS BETTER
GLGjRo02g90_10 0 AND YOU WANT TO USE A SMALLER GAUGE YARN NOTHING TOO HEAVY CAUSE YOU REALLY WANT TO GET A NICE COVER ALL THE WAY THE RUBBER BAND
GLGjRo02g90_11 0 AND SINCE YOU'RE USING A SMALL YARN USE A SMALLER NEEDLE AND YOU ALSO NEED SOME SCISSORS
GLGjRo02g90_12 0 AND THEN ONCE YOU COMPLETE YOUR PROJECT YOU'LL NEED A LIGHTER TO HELP MEL YOUR YARN
GLGjRo02g90_13 0 AND WE CAN GET STARTED

GlzGBHkMXWI_3 0 ROTORS USUALLY APPEAR ON THE FRONT OF A CAR AND ARE USED FOR BREAKING
GlzGBHkMXWI_4 0 NEWER CARS DO HAVE ROTORS IN THE BACK
GlzGBHkMXWI_5 0 THE ROTOR APPEARS ON THE ON THE WHEEL AND IT TURNS AS YOU'RE GOING DOWN THE ROAD AND THEN WHEN YOU PRESS ON THE BRAKES ARE A HYDRAULIC FLUID IS PUSHED THROUGH THIS LINE INTO THE CALIPER
GlzGBHkMXWI_6 0 THE CALIPER THEN PUTS PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PADS SUCH AS THIS IS THE BRAKE PAD AND THAT PRESSURE THEN PUSHES ON THE ROTOR AND APPLY STOPPING POWER FOR THAT ROTOR
GlzGBHkMXWI_7 0 ON MANY OF THE BRAKE PADS THERE'S USUALLY A LITTLE FEELER GAUGE AND THAT FEELER GAUGE WHEN THE BRAKES GET TOO LOW WILL START DRAGGING ON THE ROTOR AND WHEN YOU HEAR THAT LITTLE NOISE AND IT STARTS WHEN YOU START BACKING UP IT'LL MAKE A NOISE AND WHEN YOU HEAR START HEARING THAT NOISE YOU'LL KNOW THAT THE BRAKES NEED TO BE REPLACED

HeBgFmC7egw_9 0 OKAY SO GOING TO TOSS UP AND BACK AND UP AND CLAP AND UP AND CLAP

GyEToz8_FXE_1 0 EACH UP THIS SIDE OF THE DRY CLEANING MACHINE AND ADD A STEAM CLEAN THAT SPOT ON IT AND I TOOK IT OFF THE HANGER SO IT WOULD NOT STRETCH
GyEToz8_FXE_2 0 WE ARE THEN GOING TO DO THE FINISHING PRESSING ON IT AND AT THAT POINT I WILL TAKE THE TERM GARMENTS THEIR HANGING HERE
GyEToz8_FXE_3 0 I WOULD LOOK AT THEIR NECK TO AND SEE THAT THIS IS A TOO FAR OR WE CAN READ THE TICKET I HAD WHEN I PUT THE NAME OF THE CUSTOMER ON ON THE ORIGINAL
GyEToz8_FXE_4 0 I'D CHECK FOR THIS GARMENT AND THEN I WOULD CHECK THIS
GyEToz8_FXE_5 0 I MIGHT HAVE TWENTY FIVE THIRTY GARMENTS HERE
GyEToz8_FXE_6 0 A I'D LOOK FOR THIS ONE THE SAY AND I WOULD THEN HAVE TO FOLD IT UP NICE AND REALLY PUT IT ON ITS HANGER
GyEToz8_FXE_7 0 NOW IF THIS WAS A SILK GARMENT I MIGHT PUT TISSUE PAPER IF IT'S A VERY FINE GARMENT OVER THE HANGER BUT BEING THIS IS JUST BOWL HERE IT WILL THEN MANNER
GyEToz8_FXE_8 0 I HAVE CHECK THE TICKETS

gY2MSxD4-s4_1 0 OKAY IN THE LAST SEGMENT WE LEARNED IT USING ENGLISH DOES NOT HELP US CONTROL THE DIRECTION THAT THE CUE BALL COMES OFF OF AN OBJECT BALL AT AN ANGLE
gY2MSxD4-s4_2 0 THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO SET UP THE SAME SHOT SAME WAY AND WE'RE GOING TO HIT IT WITH ENGLISH AS WE DID LAST THREE TIMES
gY2MSxD4-s4_3 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO HIT IT ONE TIME WITHOUT ANY ENGLISH
gY2MSxD4-s4_4 0 BUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR THIS TIME IS WHAT ANGLE DOES THE CUE BALL COME OFF OF THE CUSHION
gY2MSxD4-s4_5 0 AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE CLUE
gY2MSxD4-s4_6 0 THIS IS WHERE ENGLISH IS USED
gY2MSxD4-s4_7 0 YOU USE ENGLISH TO CONTROL THE ANGLES THAT A BALL COMES OFF OF A CUSHION NOT THE ANGLES THAT IT COMES OFF OF ANOTHER BALL
gY2MSxD4-s4_8 0 SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE SHOT ONCE AGAIN HIT WITH NO ENGLISH AND WE'RE GOING TO HIT IT JUST LIKE THAT GOES OVER TO OUR SPOT AND WE SEE THAT IT GIVES US AN ANGLE THAT COMES OFF ROUGHLY THE SAME AS THE ANGLE THAT WHEN IN
gY2MSxD4-s4_9 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO TAKE THAT SHOT AND WE'RE GOING TO USE LEFT HAND ENGLISH AND IT SHOULD COME RIGHT OVER PRETTY MUCH TO THAT SAME PIECE THE CHALK
gY2MSxD4-s4_10 0 BUT WATCH WHAT ANGLE IT COMES OFF AT THIS TIME
gY2MSxD4-s4_11 0 COMES OFF WAY OVER HERE
gY2MSxD4-s4_12 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO USE THAT SAME SET UP GOING TO USE LEFT HAND ENGLISH THIS TIME

hFHaLD13c2Q_6 0 AS I SWITCH BEFORE DEHYDRATION IS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY A REAL RISK WITH CENTIPEDES
hFHaLD13c2Q_7 0 SO YOU DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE SUBSTRATE IS IS STAYING NICE IN AND HUMID AND MOIST INSIDE THE ENCLOSURE IN A GOOD RULE FOR THAT GENERALLY WHAT I'M BUT I FIND IS THAT IF I CAN SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A OF HUMIDITY OR MOISTURE GATHERING ON THE AREA OF THE ENCLOSURE THAT IS NOT MOSS SUBSTRATE I'M PROBABLY PRETTY SAFE

G839uQf0kfc_2 0 TECHNIQUE OF MOVING ON ROCK CAN BE GENERALIZED INTO A FEW PIECES ONE THING IS TO REMEMBER THAT YOU'RE NOT CLIMBING A LADDER
G839uQf0kfc_3 0 THERE MAY BE HOLDS THAT YOU CAN PULL STRAIGHT DOWN ON BUT THE MAIN UP A AND IF YOU'RE NOT OPEN TO THE IDEA OF USING HOLDS THAT DON'T LOOK LIKE LETTER RUNGS HUMUS OUT OF A LOT
G839uQf0kfc_4 0 SO DON'T ALWAYS IMAGINE YOU'RE GOING TO STEP UP AND PULL DOWN JUST LIKE CLIMBING A LADDER
G839uQf0kfc_5 0 ANOTHER IDEA IS THE LEGS ARE STRONGER THAN ARMS YOU DON'T NEED TO DO PULL UPS ALL THE WAY UP THE CLIFF TO GET TO THE TOP
G839uQf0kfc_6 0 IN FACT MOST PEOPLE CAN'T EVEN GOOD CLIMBERS YOU WANT TO USE YOUR LEGS AND A LOT OF CLIMBING TECHNIQUE IS ABOUT FIGURING OUT HOW TO PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR FEET TO SPARE YOUR ARMS
G839uQf0kfc_7 0 THIRD THING YOU'RE BONES ARE STRONGER THAN YOUR MUSCLES SO IF I CAN FIND A WAY TO PUSH DOWN AND USE MY BONE ON MY ARM AROUND MY LEG THEN THAT'S GOING TO SAVE MY MUSCLES A LOT OF WORK
G839uQf0kfc_8 0 SO WE WANT TO ALWAYS USE MY BONES WHEN I CAN
G839uQf0kfc_9 0 WHAT I ALWAYS BE ABLE TO DO IT BUT THOSE PIECES WILL HELP YOU REMEMBER THAT HOLDS AREN'T ALWAYS LIKE LETTER RUNGS LEGS A STRONGER THAN ARMS AND BONES ARE STRONG THE MUSCLES
GWKH-f_RT-Y_1 0 ALRIGHT SO BEFORE WE START THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT STAGE COMBAT IS SAFETY

GWKH-f_RT-Y_4 0 YOU'RE ALWAYS HITTING AROUND OR YOU'RE FACING IT OUT SOME WAY TO TRICK THE AUDIENCE
GWKH-f_RT-Y_5 0 THAT'S WHY IT'S STAGE THAT'S WHY IT'S FAKE
GWKH-f_RT-Y_6 0 ANOTHER THING IS BEFORE YOU GO AND IT AND START PRACTICING STAGE COMBAT WHAT YOU SHOULD ALWAYS DO IS HAVE A HAVE AN OUTLINE OR HAVE A IN A OF A REALLY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING IN THE SCENE OR IN THE IN THE STAGE FIGHT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING
GWKH-f_RT-Y_7 0 YOU NEVER WANT TO IMPROV THAT YOU NEVER WANT TO MAKE IT UP ON THE SPOT BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN SOMEONE REALLY GET HURT
GWKH-f_RT-Y_8 0 EVERY PUNCH EVERY MOVE EVERY STEP BEFORE YOU START PRACTICING SHOULD BE WELL THAWED OUT
GWKH-f_RT-Y_9 0 ALSO BEFORE YOU START PRACTICING STAGE COMBAT YOU REALLY NEED TO FIND A SPACE THAT'S THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF ROOM IN
GWKH-f_RT-Y_10 0 LIKE IN THIS ROOM WE'VE CLEARED OUT MOST EVERYTHING SO THAT IF YOU KNOW I FALL OR I SLIPPER TRIP I'M NOT GOING TO HIT MY HEAD ON A CORNER OF A COUCH OR YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO KNOCK A WHOLE BUNCH OF BOOKS OFF A SHELF OR ANYTHING EVERYTHING IS PRETTY PRETTY A CLEAR AND
GWKH-f_RT-Y_11 0 ALSO YOU WANT A FLOOR THAT'S NIGHT IT'S OKAY IF THE FLOOR SEMI HARD
GWKH-f_RT-Y_12 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE FALLING YOU WANT TO EAT YOU ALWAYS WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE WHERE THERE'S A MAT OR EVEN OUTSIDE ON YOUR LINE OR ON THE BEACH
GWKH-f_RT-Y_13 0 YOU NEVER WANT TO FALL ON LIKE CONCRETE OR ASPHALT YOU CAN REALLY SCREW YOURSELF UP THAT WAY
GWKH-f_RT-Y_14 0 THOSE ARE SOME BASIC BASIC BASIC THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE YOU START PRACTICING STAGE COMBAT

hCXQrqaHINM_3 0 REALLY WHAT EXACTLY ARE FUSION EXTENSIONS
hCXQrqaHINM_4 0 THE FUSION HAIR EXTENSIONS ARE THE PROCESS OF BONDING YOUR OWN HAIR TO APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE PIECES OF HUMAN HAIR CREATING ROWS THROUGHOUT YOUR HEAD TO CREATE A FOLDER AND THICKER LOOK
hCXQrqaHINM_5 0 NOW THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF DIFFERENT EXTENSIONS THAT YOU CAN GET I SPECIALIZE INFUSION HAIR EXTENSIONS AND I CHOOSE TO DO THIS BECAUSE IT'S LONG LASTING AND IT CREATES THE LOOK THAT EVERYBODY'S GOING FOR
hCXQrqaHINM_6 0 SUCH AS ALL THE CELEBRITIES AND THE MUSICIANS OUT THERE
hCXQrqaHINM_7 0 ALL THAT LONG HAIR IT'S ALL FUSION HAIR EXTENSION
hCXQrqaHINM_8 0 AND IT'S A FOR MY HAIR
hCXQrqaHINM_9 0 OH IT'S VERY SAFE THE PRODUCT THAT I USE IS THE LEFT OF THE LEAST HARMFUL TO YOUR HAIR WHEN YOU'RE TAKING IT OUT IT CAUSES LESS BREAKAGE UNLESS DAMAGE VERSUS ALL THE PRODUCTS THAT I'VE USED ON THE MARKET THIS IS THE BEST ONE BY FAR
gfEoLbSQLow_1 0 HI I'M TONY KNOWN FROM EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT AND STYLES AND PRACTICE WITH IN THE FORM
gfEoLbSQLow_2 0 LEARNING TO PLAY THE PIANO
gfEoLbSQLow_3 0 ESTABLISHING A PRACTICE RETAIN AS PARAMOUNT IF YOU WANT TO DO A SUCCEED BEEN PLAYING PIANO BECAUSE THE THING THAT YOU NEED TO DO REGULARLY AND AN INTENSE LAYER TO GET ANYWHERE
gfEoLbSQLow_4 0 I'M EVEN PRACTICE OR IF YOU WANT ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS BUT JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE A YOUR PROGRESS WILL DEFINITELY A SLOPE BEAD SLOW IT DOWN
gfEoLbSQLow_5 0 OKAY NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT SO I WOULD SAY AT LEAST A HALF AN HOUR EVERYBODY CAN AFFORD AND HALF AN HOUR OR THREE TIMES A WICK AND THAT WOULD BE A WAY TO START A AND THEN YOU CAN AT FIFTEEN MINUTES SO THAT AS YOU GO ALONG UNTIL YOU WORK YOURSELF UP TO TWO OR THREE HOURS AND DEPENDING ON IF YOU WANT TO BECOME A PROFESSIONAL IF YOU JUST WANT TO BE AN OBVIOUS SO THAT PLAYS GOOD KNOWS THAT
gfEoLbSQLow_6 0 OR IF YOU JUST WANT IMPROVISING RIGHT SONG
gfEoLbSQLow_7 0 NOW IN THE PROCESS OF PRACTICING THERE ARE THREE THINGS THAT ARE A VERY IMPORTANT THAT IS THAT YOU NEED TO CONCENTRATE ON IN THAT IS TECHNIQUE MUSICIANSHIP AND REPERTOIRE
gfEoLbSQLow_8 0 OKAY TECHNIQUE MUSICIANSHIP AND REPERTOIRE
gfEoLbSQLow_9 0 TECHNIQUE IS HOW YOU'RE ACTUALLY USING YOUR HANDS YOUR BODY IN YOUR WRIST AND ALL OF THE RIDE
gfEoLbSQLow_10 0 MUSICIANSHIP AS KNOWING WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT YOU'RE APPLYING
gfEoLbSQLow_11 0 IF YOU'RE PLAYING A C CHORD THEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE PLAYING A C CHORD IF YOU'RE PLAYING A C SCALE ON THEN YOUR KNOW THAT YOU'RE PLAYING A C SCALE
gfEoLbSQLow_12 0 THAT MEANS MUSICIANSHIP MEANS UNDERSTANDING TECHNICALLY A MUSICAL A WHAT YOUR DOING
gfEoLbSQLow_13 0 RUBBER TOP OF COURSE IS ALWAYS PRACTICE A SONG OR SOME TYPE OF WHOLE SONG THAT YOU CAN PLAY EVEN IF IT'S JUST CARDS ARE ON WHATEVER BUT THEN YOU AT NEW SONGS OVER TIME YOU SIT DOWN TO PLAY
gfEoLbSQLow_14 0 THESE THREE THINGS TECHNIQUE MUSICIANS JOB AND REPERTOIRE ALWAYS KEEP THESE THINGS IN MIND WHEN YOU'RE ESTABLISHING THAT YOUR PRACTICE ROOTING AND THE NEXT PART OF THAT IS THE DISCIPLINE TO APPLY THOSE
gfEoLbSQLow_15 0 DON'T FORGET BECAUSE EVERY ONLY STUDY TECHNIQUE OR REPERTOIRE IT AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO MESS AUTUMN MUSICIANSHIP AND THEN SOMEBODY AS TO WHAT YOUR PLATE AND YOU WON'T KNOW
gfEoLbSQLow_16 0 OR IF YOU JUST ONLY STUDIED MUSICIANSHIP THAN YOU PLAY THE SONGS THEN YOUR TAP KNAP WON'T BALL SO AS LONG AS YOU ARE AWARE OF THE STORY FACETS OF A YOUR PROGRESS AND IF YOU'RE APPLYING THEN YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO INVOLVED IN YOUR CREATIVITY AND YOUR TECHNIQUE
gSiLajKc2Ys_1 0 THE STABILITY BALL EXERCISE IS GOING TO TARGET THE OBLIQUES WHICH RUN ON THE SIDE OF THE WAYS
gSiLajKc2Ys_2 0 SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO TRIM DOWN YOUR WAISTLINE THEN THIS IS ONE EXERCISE THAT YOU'D WANT TO INCORPORATE INTO YOUR TRAINING PROGRAM
gSiLajKc2Ys_3 0 TAKE A KNEELING POSITION AND AGAIN PULL THE BALL INTO MY HIP AND PLACE THE HIP ON TOP OF THE BALL TO LEAN OVER AND I'VE JUST PLACE MY HAND AT THE SIDE AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS REDUCE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN MY RIB CAGE AND MY HIP
gSiLajKc2Ys_4 0 SO I'M LIFTING TO THE SIDE
gSiLajKc2Ys_5 0 I'VE GOT GRAVITY COMING DOWN ON THE MUSCLE GROUP AND I'M TRYING TO LIFT MY UPPER BODY AGAINST THE GRAVITY TO CONTRACT THAT MUSCLE
gSiLajKc2Ys_6 0 THIS WOULD BE A LEVEL ONE EXERCISE
gSiLajKc2Ys_7 0 ONE THING YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS TRY NOT TO LEAVE THE MOVEMENT WITH THE HEAD BUT KEEP THE HEAD IN LINE WITH THE SPINE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN
gSiLajKc2Ys_8 0 TO ADVANCED EXERCISE I COME UP ON TO BOTH LEGS SO I'VE ADDED A BALANCE CHALLENGE PLACE THE HAND BY THE EAR AND AGAIN THE MOVEMENT IS INITIATED FROM THE OBLIQUE MUSCLES ON THE SIDE LIFTING UP

hiY_wZXp7tI_1 0 WE ALL LOVE ARE BEAUTIFUL GRAIN LINES
hiY_wZXp7tI_2 0 AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE FIND THESE WEEDS POPPING UP EVERYWHERE AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
hiY_wZXp7tI_3 0 WE RUN DOWN THE STORE AND GET ALL TYPES OF CHEMICALS THAT WILL KILL THE BROAD LEAVES
hiY_wZXp7tI_4 0 BUT WHAT WE DON'T REALIZE IS ALL THOSE CHEMICALS OR KILLING EVERYTHING ELSE TO

hiY_wZXp7tI_8 0 FIRST OF ALL THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR LAWN IS TO GIVE IT MORE GRASS SEED IN THE SPRING IN THE FALL
hiY_wZXp7tI_9 0 SO THE EASIEST WAY TO GET RID OF WEEDS IN YOUR LAWN OR TO STOP THEM FROM SHOWING UP AT ALL IS TO JUST TAKE THE LITTLE AREAS IN YOUR YARD WHERE THERE ARE SOME WEEDS OR BLANK SPOTS AND EVERY SPRING IN THE LATE SPRING ABOUT APRIL IN THE NIGHT SO GETTING A LITTLE WARMER JUST ADD A BUNCH OF COMPOST OR POTTING SOIL ON TOP OF YOUR WEEDS AND JUST GRASS SEED
hiY_wZXp7tI_10 0 JUST PUT LOTS OF GRASS SEED PERENNIAL GRASSY THAT'LL COME BACK EVERY YEAR ON TOP OF THE DIRT
hiY_wZXp7tI_11 0 AND YOU'LL FIND THE GRASS WILL JUST FILL IN ABOVE THE WEEDS IN THE WEEDS WANT TO BE THERE
hiY_wZXp7tI_12 0 I'VE DONE THIS EVERY SPRING EVERY FALL AND I FOUND THAT MOST OF THE WEEDS IN MY LAWN ARE GONE WITH LITTLE TO NO TROUBLE AT ALL
gEkoOhu1PEM_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN A DEMONSTRATION OF AN ACTUAL RANCH SORTING

gEkoOhu1PEM_4 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING SOME DUPLICATE IS AN IMPROVISING SO THAT WE CAN SHOW THE SPORT BUT WE WON'T BE NECESSARY ABLE TO DO THE FULL SEQUENCE OF NUMBERS
gEkoOhu1PEM_5 0 WE DO HAVE TWELVE COWS SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO SORT THEM ONE OF THE TIME IN THE ORDER THAT WE'VE COME TO UNDERSTAND
gEkoOhu1PEM_6 0 IT WILL START WITH THE ANNOUNCER SAYING FLAGS UP AND A JUDGE SITTING RIGHT HERE AT THE FOLLOW LINE
gEkoOhu1PEM_7 0 THE JUDGE WILL HAVE A FLAG UP AND AS THEY SAY THAT IT IN TITLES MEAT ACROSS THE LINE
gEkoOhu1PEM_8 0 WHICH TIME THE ANNOUNCER WILL SAY YOUR NUMBER IS
gEkoOhu1PEM_9 0 WE'RE GOING TO START WITH ZERO TODAY SO THAT WE SLOWLY GO THROUGH AND SHOW YOU MORE THE STRATEGY AND THEN WE'LL PICK IT UP TO BE THE SPEED
gEkoOhu1PEM_10 0 SO I'M GOING TO GO IN THERE AND I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR MY ZERO AND THEN SLOWLY BRING IT ACROSS AS LAURA GUARDS WHAT WE CALL THE HOLE
gEkoOhu1PEM_11 0 I WANT TO TRY TO BRING AS FEW COWS ISN'T AS I CAN SO THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORK QUITE SO HARD AT PROTECTING THAT IMPORTANT SPACE
gEkoOhu1PEM_12 0 IF THE WRONG COW COMES ACROSS THEN WE'VE COMPLETELY GONE BUST
gEkoOhu1PEM_13 0 WE HAVE TWO ONES TODAY SO I'M LOOKING FOR MY NEXT ONE AND IT COMES IN ONE VERY EASILY AND NOW WE'LL LOOK FOR OUR THREES
gEkoOhu1PEM_14 0 WE DO NOT HAVE A TWO
gEkoOhu1PEM_15 0 WE HAVE TWO THREES TODAY
gEkoOhu1PEM_16 0 SO THAT WOULD BE THE NEXT ORDER AND SHE DOES SHE BRINGS IT AROUND I'M TRYING TO LET MY HORSE DO ITS JOB AND IF BOTH OF THEM CAME TOGETHER SINCE THAT'S OUR PREFER TO ORDER TODAY
gEkoOhu1PEM_17 0 THAT WAS WORKING WE'VE GOT A TRASH HOW WE GOT TO STOP
gEkoOhu1PEM_18 0 OKAY SO NOW I'M GOING TO GO GET THE THREE AND LAUREL LET IT GO AND NOW SHE'S GOING TO LOOK FOR WE HAVE A FOR IT AND THAT FOR COMES ACROSS I'M ALREADY ON MY WAY OUT AND NOW I HAVE TWO SEVENTIES AND SINCE THEY'RE COMING TOGETHER WILL LET THEM GO
gEkoOhu1PEM_19 0 IN OUR COMPETITION IF WE HAD TO IN ORDER THAT WOULD BE FINE AS LONG AS THEY WERE CORRECTLY PLACED
gEkoOhu1PEM_20 0 SO NOW I'LL GO AHEAD AND GET THE RED COW TO THE WHITE FACE AND LEAVE THE BLACK AND WHITE
gEkoOhu1PEM_21 0 WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED ARE TRASH COWS IN A REAL COMPETITION

GXOKugPo23g_2 0 THE SHOULDER ITSELF CAN ACTUALLY MOVE IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT RANGE OF MOTION AT THE SAME TIME THAT MOTION LENS THE SHOULDER TO INJURY MORE SEPARATELY THEN SAY AND BE OR WRIST OR AN ELBOW WHICH HAS MORE OF A BUNNY ATTACHMENT STRONGER LIGAMENTS
GXOKugPo23g_3 0 WE LOOK AT THE MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER AS A PRIMARY ATTACHMENT TO THE SCALP SO SYSTEM
GXOKugPo23g_4 0 IF THESE MUSCLES ARE IN SPASMS KNOCKING LET THE SHOULDER MOVE LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO THAT LACK OF MOVEMENT CAN LEND ITSELF TO INJURIES STIR OVER IT OVER YOU STRAINS A LIST OF THEM AS WHAT CAN HAPPEN WITH THE SHOULDER AND ESPECIALLY WITH ALL THE THE SPORTS THAT THE SHOULDERS INVOLVED WITH SO IT IS IMPERATIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MUSCULAR ATTACHES TO THE SHOULDER WORKING ACTORS POST TO IN ADDITION TO MAKING SURE THAT THE JOINTS OF THE SHOULDER OR MOVING LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO

GhhALfB_1Aw_1 0 OKAY THE NEXT FORM OF NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS SPACE AND SPACE IS SPACE
GhhALfB_1Aw_2 0 IT IS THE SPACE AROUND YOU
GhhALfB_1Aw_3 0 IT'S OFFICIALLY CALLED PROXIMATE AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE THREE SETS OF PRODUCTS AMYX AROUND THIS
GhhALfB_1Aw_4 0 WHAT THIS IS IS BASICALLY THE BUBBLE OR THE WALL IN WHICH YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO ANYBODY IN THERE BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE THREE SETS OF WALLS
GhhALfB_1Aw_5 0 FIRST WE HAVE OUR SOCIAL DISTANCE
GhhALfB_1Aw_6 0 THAT'S WHERE OKAY I WANT TO ONLY KEEP YOU HERE BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY KNOW YOU

GhhALfB_1Aw_12 0 AND THEN OF COURSE THE LAST SET OF SPACE IS THE INTIMATE DISTANCE WHICH IS VERY VERY VERY CLUBS
GhhALfB_1Aw_13 0 NOW IT IS SO INTERESTING BECAUSE AMERICANS HAVE THE LARGEST AREA OF PRODUCTS AND MIX AROUND THEM COMPARED TO ANY OTHER CULTURE
GhhALfB_1Aw_14 0 WE DON'T LIKE PEOPLE UP CLOSE TO US WHERE OTHER CULTURES THEY GET RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER
GhhALfB_1Aw_15 0 IN FACT I BET THIS IS HAPPEN TO YOU

GhhALfB_1Aw_24 0 YOU STEP BACK
GhhALfB_1Aw_25 0 THEY STEP IN
GhhALfB_1Aw_26 0 VERY CLEARLY THE SPACE AROUND THEM IS NOT AS DEEP AS THE SPACE AROUND YOU SO BE VERY AWARE OF PEOPLE SPACE
hgZ_GabeHAQ_1 0 THE FIRST POINT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS CROOKED POOL OR LARGE INTESTINE ELEVEN
hgZ_GabeHAQ_2 0 THIS ONE IS PARTICULARLY GOOD FOR DRAINING HEAT AND DAMPNESS IN THE ELBOW JOINT
hgZ_GabeHAQ_3 0 SO THIS IS ONE YOU WANT TO USE ESPECIALLY FOR A DOG WHO HAS HOT TENDER TO THE TOUCH ELBOW
hgZ_GabeHAQ_4 0 THIS WILL BE A PARTICULARLY GOOD ONE
hgZ_GabeHAQ_5 0 DAMPNESS IF THE LEG TENDS TO SWELL UP ON OR IF THE DOG RESPONDS AND IS WORSE IN WORST PAINT ON DAMP DAYS THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD POINT FOR YOU TO USE
hgZ_GabeHAQ_6 0 IF YOUR DOG TENDS TO BE ONE THE PANTS A LOT IS USUALLY HOT AND TIRED YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO USE THIS POINT
hgZ_GabeHAQ_7 0 YOU WANT TO SKIP IT
hgZ_GabeHAQ_8 0 IT IS FOUND BY GOING DOWN INTO THE CREASE OF THE ELBOW RIGHT IN THE SIDE
hgZ_GabeHAQ_9 0 AND AS WITH MOST TACKY PRESSURE POINTS YOUR FINGERS ARE GOING TO FALL INTO THIS HOLE
hgZ_GabeHAQ_10 0 AND THAT'S WHERE YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR PRESSURE
hgZ_GabeHAQ_11 0 YOU CAN DO A STEADY ONE FINGER PRESSURE TO STAYING IN THAT PLACE OR YOU CAN DO CIRCULAR MOTION WITH YOUR THUMB OR WITH THE BALL OF YOUR FINGER

G_leenn4ZPM_4 0 THE FIRST WAY IS CALLED TRADITIONAL OR SIDE OUT SCORING
G_leenn4ZPM_5 0 AND WHAT WHEN USING THIS TYPE OF SCORING AND THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A POINT IS WHEN YOU SERVE THE BALL
G_leenn4ZPM_6 0 SO IF MY TEAM WHICH IS SERVE THE BALL AND WE GET IT IN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CHORD WE GET IN THE SQUARE IN THE ON THE GROUND WE GET A POINT
G_leenn4ZPM_7 0 HOWEVER IF THE OTHER TEAM'S SERVES AND WE HIT IT OUT OR THEY HIT IN OUR SQUARE THEY GET THE POINT
G_leenn4ZPM_8 0 THE ONLY WAY IN TRADITIONAL INSIDE OUT SCORING YOU CAN GET A POINT IS IF YOU SERVE THE BALL
G_leenn4ZPM_9 0 TYPICALLY IN TRADITIONAL OUR SIDE OUT SCORING THE GAMES GO TO FIFTEEN OR A LOT OF IN
G_leenn4ZPM_10 0 THE OTHER TYPE OF SCORING IS RALLY SCORING
G_leenn4ZPM_11 0 RALLY SCORING IS WHERE EVERY SERVE IS A POINT
G_leenn4ZPM_12 0 SO IF MY TEAM SERVES A BALL BUT AT THE OTHER TEAM GETS THE BALL AND IT PUTS IT INTO OUR SIDE OF THE COURT AND THEY GET THE POINT EVEN THOUGH THAT INSERT THE BALL AND VICE VERSA
G_leenn4ZPM_13 0 RICE GOING USUALLY GOES TWENTY ONE TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY
G_leenn4ZPM_14 0 AND THAT IS HOW YOU KEEP SCORE AND VOLLEYBALL
gwXiVX3GwN4_1 0 FIRST STRIKE IS A KEY WORD CREATURE ABILITY
gwXiVX3GwN4_2 0 HERE ON THE CARD CALLED MOSQUITO GUARD YOU'LL SEE THAT IT SAYS FOR STRIKE
gwXiVX3GwN4_3 0 YOU KNOW THE REINFORCED ONE FOR NOW THAT'LL BE ANOTHER LESSON
gwXiVX3GwN4_4 0 WHAT FIRST STRIKE MEANS IS THAT WHEN TO CREATURES FIGHT THE FIRST STRIKE CREATURE DEALS IT'S DAMAGE BEFORE THE OTHER CREATURE GETS TO FIGHT BACK
gwXiVX3GwN4_5 0 IN THIS CASE THE MOSQUITO CARD EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONLY A ONE ONE CAN DEFEAT THE CRESTED CRAGG HORNS BECAUSE IT'S TOUGHNESS IS ONLY ONE
gwXiVX3GwN4_6 0 IF THERE IS A CREATURE WITH FOR STRIKE INVOLVED IN COMBAT THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL COMBAT DAMAGE STEP JUST FOR FIRST STRIKERS AND ONLY CREATURES THAT SURVIVE THE FIRST STRIKE COMBAT DAMAGE STEP ARE ALLOWED TO DEAL THEIR DAMAGE IN RETURN
gwXiVX3GwN4_7 0 THE MOSQUITO GUARD WILL KILL THE CRESTED CRACK WORN BY DEALING ONE POINT OF FUR STRIKE DAMAGE
gwXiVX3GwN4_8 0 AND THE MOSQUITO GUARD SURVIVES WITH OF WITHOUT TAKING THE FOUR DAMAGE THAT THE CRESTED CRACK CORN WOULD DEAL
glC40wsPJco_1 0 <UNK> COMPUTERIZED KARAOKE HOSTING SOLUTION IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF ENVISION SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS
glC40wsPJco_2 0 AND I AM IN NO WAY AFFILIATED WITH ENVISION SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS
glC40wsPJco_3 0 OKAY IN THIS NEXT CLIP I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE AVERAGE PERFORMANCE TIME
glC40wsPJco_4 0 THIS IS A GREAT TOOL BECAUSE AS YOU HAVE YOUR EVALUATED SCREEN THEY WILL ACTUALLY TELL OF THE UPCOMING PERFORMANCES
glC40wsPJco_5 0 BUT WHAT'S GREAT IT WILL TELL A TO BE ABLE TO TELL A PERSON WHAT TIME THEY'RE COMING
glC40wsPJco_6 0 I KNOW ON HAND A PRETTY MUCH EVERY SONG IS ABOUT THREE TO FOUR MINUTES
glC40wsPJco_7 0 SO IF YOU SET YOUR AVERAGE TIME OF PERFORMANCE A PERFORMANCE TIME IS FOUR MINUTES THAT MEANS OF BETWEEN EACH SING IT IS A FOUR MINUTES GAP
glC40wsPJco_8 0 SO IF HEATHER SINGING AND SHE COMES IN ITS SEVEN FIFTEEN AND SEVEN NINETEEN SHE'S GOING TO START I KNOW IN FOUR MINUTES JOHN IS GOING TO BE UP AFTER THAT
glC40wsPJco_9 0 AND RICH IS GOING TO BE UP
glC40wsPJco_10 0 BUT IF YOU HAVE TWENTY THIRTY PEOPLE YOU COULD ACTUALLY GO ALL THE WAY DOWN ON THE BOTTOM AND GIVE THEM AN IDEA
glC40wsPJco_11 0 AM I GOING TO BE GETTING UP FOR ANOTHER HALF AN HOUR
glC40wsPJco_12 0 AND AGAIN IS PEOPLE A CHANCE THAT GO MINGLE GO TO THE BEDROOM OR DO WHATEVER
glC40wsPJco_13 0 IT'S JUST A REALLY GOOD FEATURE TO HAVE BECAUSE PEOPLE LOVE TO KNOW WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO SING KNACKS IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT
glC40wsPJco_14 0 ELIMINATES WHILE YOU IS THE CAGE A HAVING THE HEEL ONE OF THE DREADED THINGS OF THAT WE HIT HEARING ALL NIGHT LONG AS WHEN PEOPLE KEEP COMING UP UNSTABLE WHEN I'M MY NEXT
glC40wsPJco_15 0 NOW YOU CAN GIVE THEM A CLEAR CLOT CLEAR PRECISE TIME IS IS WHEN THEY'RE COMING UP
glC40wsPJco_16 0 RIGHT NEXT TO IT AS YOUR REFRESH BUTTON
glC40wsPJco_17 0 SO IF YOU WANT TO JUST REFRESHED YOUR SING AS YOU CAN JUST DO THAT AND REFRESH IT AND CHANGE IT TO WHATEVER YOU FEEL A MIGHT BE THE CASE
glC40wsPJco_18 0 I LIKE FOUR MINUTES IS A STANDARD TIME BETWEEN EACH SONG

H5z-K-iZF2s_1 0 THIS TYPE OF OPENING IS CALLED A HEARTED HAPPENING WITH FACING WHICH MEANS IT HAS A CLEAN FINISH
H5z-K-iZF2s_2 0 THE HEART COMES FROM THE FACT THAT THIS IS SHAPED AS A HEART
H5z-K-iZF2s_3 0 IF WE'RE GOING TO DO A REAL HEART THERE'S REALLY TAKE THE HEART FROM
H5z-K-iZF2s_4 0 BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT LOOKS STUPID WITH SO UNLESS YOU BUT A LIKING FOR HEARTS IN GENERAL DON'T BOTHER
H5z-K-iZF2s_5 0 TAKE THE BOTTOM OF IT AND CURVE OUT THE EDGES AND CURVE IT IN AND CURVE IT AND KIND OF LIKE YOUR SCALPING IT LIKE A SWEETHEART NECKLINE BUT IT'S HEART SHAPE
H5z-K-iZF2s_6 0 AND THEN THE FACT THAT IT'S WITH FACING MEANS THAT THIS LINE OF YOUR NECK AND THEN BECOMES THE STITCH LINE FOR AT PEACE MIRRORING THIS TO BE PLACED ON TOP RIGHT SIDE THE RIGHT SIDE STITCHED ALONG THE HEART AND THEN FLIPS IN INSIDE OUT FLIPS INTO THE INTERIOR OF IT AND THEN IRONED ALONG THIS LINE WHICH JUST ALLOWS FOR CLEAN FINISH AND ALLOWS FOR THE SHAPE TO BE RETAIN WITHOUT STRETCHING OUT THE FABRIC
GNKJATaBTwI_1 0 OKAY SO NOW I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO GET GAGES
GNKJATaBTwI_2 0 WHEN YOU'RE FIRST STARTING FACE PAINTING THE BEST THING TO DO IS JUST GET YOUR NAME OUT THERE

GNKJATaBTwI_8 0 THERE THAT'S KIND OF HOW IT WORKS FOR ME BUT ALSO THERE'S MILLIONS OF THINGS YOU CAN DO SUCH AS FESTIVALS BIRTHDAY PARTIES AND SLOWLY ONCE YOUR NAME DOES START LEAKING OUT THERE IT REALLY STARTS TAKING UP BUT TO GET YOUR NAME OUT THERE I SUGGEST YOU GET YOURSELF A WEBSITE IF YOU REALLY LIKE THE STUFF THAT YOU DO HAVE A BUNCH OF PICTURES TO UPLOAD
GNKJATaBTwI_9 0 START UP ON IT
GNKJATaBTwI_10 0 GET A WEBSITE GOING
GNKJATaBTwI_11 0 GET YOURSELF SOME CARDS AND JUST MAKE CONTACT
GNKJATaBTwI_12 0 WHEN YOU'RE ON THE INTERNET YOU CAN FIND TONS OF DIFFERENT THINGS DO ALL SORTS OF VARIETIES OF WEBSITES SETTLE DIRECTLY AT FESTIVALS AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEARS THAT YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR AN REGISTER FOR BOOTS AND A LOT OF TIME OF BOOTH WILL BE LIKE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT THEM THE MONEY THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT IN THE WEEKEND THAT THE FESTIVAL KAMAS IS IN THE THOUSANDS SO IT REALLY ENDS UP BEING QUIET FRUITFUL AND YOU CAN END UP GETTING A LOT OF GIGS FROM JUST PUTTING YOURSELF OUT THERE

GtmYFI0ImQ0_1 0 OKAY NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS KIND OF COLOR
GtmYFI0ImQ0_2 0 ALL THE PREFERENCES ARE IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THIS ONE I THINK THAT THIS ONE IS PRETTY COOL
GtmYFI0ImQ0_3 0 BECAUSE IT IS ACTUALLY YOU CAN LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF CPU USAGE OF BEING MADE
GtmYFI0ImQ0_4 0 AND ACTUALLY YOU'LL BE UNDER GENERAL PREFERENCES AND YOU COME DOWN TO CPU USAGE LIMIT
GtmYFI0ImQ0_5 0 AND RIGHT NOW THE FACTORY DEFAULT IS EIGHTY %PERCENT
GtmYFI0ImQ0_6 0 NOW THIS IS A IS ENOUGH TO RUN A REASON AT A GOOD RATE AND BUT YOU KNOW IS ON SOME COMPUTERS YOU MAY HAVE TROUBLE RUNNING YOUR SONGS IF YOU HAVE A LOT GOING ON
GtmYFI0ImQ0_7 0 SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY JACK OF THE COMPUTING POWER IF YOU NEED TO A A LOT MORE COMPUTING POWER TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING
GtmYFI0ImQ0_8 0 AND IT LEAVES A PERCENTAGE LEFT OVER TO DEAL WITH OTHER PROGRAMS IF YOU'RE IF REASON IS REWIRED WITH OTHER PROGRAMS ANYTHING LIKE THAT
GtmYFI0ImQ0_9 0 SO BASICALLY I THINK THAT IT'S GOOD TO GO TO LEAVE THE CPU USAGE IT EIGHTY %PERCENT
GtmYFI0ImQ0_10 0 I MEAN IT'S A IT'S A GOOD AMOUNT
HJTlkLXOjR4_1 0 THE NEXT THING I WANT TO DO IT DON'T TRY TO ADD SOME TYPE OF SYMBOLS HOME DO IS GO TO MY NEXT AVAILABLE TRACK DOWN AND ADD SOME MORE RIGHT HERE AND HIT ON ONE RECORD IT OUT OF CLAY IS
HJTlkLXOjR4_2 0 OF
HJTlkLXOjR4_3 0 ONE IS JUST KIND OF WITH SHOULD START OFF WITH IS WHEN USING THESE YOU CAN ALWAYS ADD MORE SYMBOL JUST LIKE ON THE NEXT ONE BIG ENOUGH TO MORE
HJTlkLXOjR4_4 0 MAKE SURE YOU ALWAYS CLICK ON WHAT YOU WANT TO PLAY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWO SEPARATE THINGS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THREE SEPARATE BRING IT IN PLAY THE SAME TIME

gRMzHsP4hns_11 0 BACK AND FORTH THEIR LAST LITTLE PIECE BUT AND THEN YOU'RE THAT'S HOW YOU CUT YOUR BREAD
gQxr6RuQnF0_1 0 THIS IS RYAN SCOTT FROM THE BOOM TOWN SAINTS ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gQxr6RuQnF0_2 0 IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO ACTUALLY SHOW YOU HOW TO THROW THE BACKING ON
gQxr6RuQnF0_3 0 CAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE TEND TO CRANK THEIR WRIST LIKE THIS THE LIKE THAT
gQxr6RuQnF0_4 0 THAT'S HOW YOU THROW ALL OF A PROPER BACKHAND IN GUTS FRISBEE OR AND JUST COMPETITIVE FRISBEE IN GENERAL
gQxr6RuQnF0_5 0 SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR ARM BACK AS FAR AS YOU CAN
gQxr6RuQnF0_6 0 AND THEN WITH YOUR RIGHT FOOT TO RIGHT IF YOU'RE RIGHT HANDED PUT YOUR RIGHT FOOT DOWN AS A PLANT FOOT
gQxr6RuQnF0_7 0 PUSH OFF YOUR LEFT FOOT AND PULL FORWARD
gQxr6RuQnF0_8 0 WHEN YOU PULL FORWARD YOU TURN YOUR BODY AND THE SHOES YOUR SHOULDER GETS PASSED YOUR OTHER SHOULDER YOUR ELBOW IS GOING TO ACTUALLY KINK IN SO
gQxr6RuQnF0_9 0 JUST USE YOUR ELBOW KINKS YOU PULL THROUGH WITH THE REST OF YOUR HAND AND THE FRISBEE'S GOING TO COME UP NICE AND SMOOTH AND HARD
gQxr6RuQnF0_10 0 SO THERE YOU GO YOU'RE PUSHING OFF YOUR LEFT FOOT ALL YOUR WEIGHT IS TRANSFERRING OVER TO THE OTHER FOOT
gQxr6RuQnF0_11 0 SO YOU PUSH UP YOUR LEFT FOOT ONTO YOUR RIGHT YOU THROW
gQxr6RuQnF0_12 0 AND YOU WANT TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH YOUR OTHER FOOT TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE POWER
gQxr6RuQnF0_13 0 AND SO WHEN YOU PULL THROUGH PUT ALL YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR LEFT FOOT
gQxr6RuQnF0_14 0 AND YOU MOVE YOUR HIPS IN YOUR SHOULDERS AT THE SAME TIME
gQxr6RuQnF0_15 0 IT'S A COMBINATION TIMING THAT PUTS YOU RIGHT THROUGH

hGAbXoyb5E4_1 0 AND CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO KICK WITH THE HEEL
hGAbXoyb5E4_2 0 NOW WHEN I CHOOSE WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF MIND INTENT INVOLVE IT'S NOT JUST PHYSICAL MOVEMENT
hGAbXoyb5E4_3 0 SO WHERE DO WE PUT OUR MIND IN THE BODY AS WE'RE DOING THESE MOVEMENT

hGAbXoyb5E4_6 0 SO EVERYTHING ENDS AT THE SAME TIME
hGAbXoyb5E4_7 0 HOWEVER WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHAT IS VERY COMMON WHEN WE DO A KICK IS THAT WE LOSE ARE ROUTE
hGAbXoyb5E4_8 0 SO THAT WHEN IT'S IF WE KICK WITHOUT ROOT IF WE KICK THE PERSON THAT WERE KICKING WILL NOT MOVE
hGAbXoyb5E4_9 0 WE WILL BALANCE BACKWARDS JUST AS WE WOULD WITH PUSH
hGAbXoyb5E4_10 0 SO WHEN WE'RE DOING THIS MOTION OF EXPANDING OUTWARD WE HAVE TO ALSO BE THINKING WORK SPINNING DOWN OR EXPANDING BACK OR SPINNING UP IT'S LIKE A BALL OR I LIKE TO SEE IT IS A SUN EXPLODING OUTWARD
hGAbXoyb5E4_11 0 SO I'M GATHERING IN GATHERING IN GATHERING IN AND THEN OUT OUT OUT OUT FROM THE CENTER

g9bQ72e7ZMo_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO VENTURE INTO WHAT I WOULD CALL MY PERFORMANCE BITS
g9bQ72e7ZMo_2 0 I WOULD KEEP A BIT SIMILAR TO THIS HANGING UP IN MY TRACK ROOM READY FOR WHAT I CALL THE DRESS REHEARSAL
g9bQ72e7ZMo_3 0 IF I HAVE A PERFORMANCE HORSE AND WE'RE GETTING READY TO COMPETE AT A HIGH LEVEL IT'S QUITE LIKELY THAT I'M GOING TO START TO SWITCH THAT HORSE INTO WHAT'S CONSIDERED YOUR TRADITIONAL KIND OF PORT STYLE LEVERAGE BIT
g9bQ72e7ZMo_4 0 THE PORT IS THIS RAISED AREA
g9bQ72e7ZMo_5 0 THIS ONE'S RATHER HIGH SOMEWHAT ASSERTIVE
g9bQ72e7ZMo_6 0 YOU MIGHT CONSIDER THIS A VERY STRONG BIT
g9bQ72e7ZMo_7 0 WE HAVE SAYINGS THAT EVEN THE RIGHT TO BIT IN THE WRONG HANDS CAN BE A PROBLEM TO THE HORSE
g9bQ72e7ZMo_8 0 THIS COULD BE CONSIDERED PERHAPS THE WRONG BIT IF IT WERE IN THE WRONG HANDS
g9bQ72e7ZMo_9 0 BUT IN THE CORRECT HANDS A RIDER HAS VERY ACCOMPLISHED TRAINED IN THE PRESENT PRESENTATION OF A GOOD PERFORMANCE HORSE THIS IS THE KIND OF BIT THAT WILL BRING YOU TO THE DRESS REHEARSAL THAT WILL ULTIMATELY TAKE YOU TO THE STAGE
g9bQ72e7ZMo_10 0 I USE THIS ONE AND TRAINING A HORSE TRYING TO CONVERT FROM THE SAND THE SNOUT FULLS IN THE SHANK SNAP FOLDS TO MOVE ON TO WHAT WE WOULD ALSO USE THEN WHEN WE GET TO THAT MORE HIGHLY POLISHED FANCY SILVER SORT OF BIT THAT WE WOULD USE THAT HAS THE SAME MECHANISM AS MY TRAINING BIT
g9bQ72e7ZMo_11 0 BUT I RESERVED THIS POLISH IT UP TO THE SIDE FOR WHEN WE GO TO THE SHOWS
g9bQ72e7ZMo_12 0 A BIT LIKE THIS MIGHT BE SEEN IN ALL THIS ALL KINDS OF DISCIPLINES PARTICULAR I'M HORSES THAT ARE OVER FIVE YEARS OLD
g9bQ72e7ZMo_13 0 UNDER FIVE YEARS OLD WE CONSIDER THEM JUNIOR HORSES AND THEY CAN PERFORM AT ALL LEVELS TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE IN THEIR SNAP FULL BITS TYPICALLY YOU'RE LOOSE RING D RINGS
g9bQ72e7ZMo_14 0 BUT ONCE THEY GET TO BE OF THE SCENE YOUR OR AGED HORSES THEY MUST SHOW AND PERFORM IN A CURB OR LEVERAGE BIT
g9bQ72e7ZMo_15 0 SO WE TYPICALLY GO TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT CREATES A FAERIE ASSERTIVE EASY TO PERFORM PUTTING THEM IN THAT COLLECTED WHAT WE CALL HOOKED IN THE BRIDLE APPEARANCE
g9bQ72e7ZMo_16 0 I WOULDN'T WANT TO USE THIS IN TRAINING
g9bQ72e7ZMo_17 0 IT WOULD TAKE AWAY THE SENSITIVITY OVER TIME
g9bQ72e7ZMo_18 0 BUT IN USED IN A PERFORMANCE HORSE THIS IS GOING TO PUT ENOUGH PRESSURE TO THE ROOF OF THEIR MOUTH THAT WITH VERY LITTLE HAND MOVEMENT THIS BIT IS GOING TO PUT THEM RIGHT WHERE I NEED EM IN WITHOUT ANY HAND MOVEMENT ON MY PART

g5i7jfPAPXQ_7 0 AND THEN IF AT ALL FOUR BALLS START YOUR SHOWER PATTERN STACK A MULTI PLEX AND GIVE IT A TOSS
g5i7jfPAPXQ_8 0 AFTER YOU'VE TOSS YOUR MULTIPLEX JUST PRACTICE STOPPING UNTIL YOU CAN GET THE MULTIPLEX SPLIT WELL ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN BEND THEM OVER ONE AT A TIME AND CONTINUE THE SHOWER PATTERN

Gwb5TRtcGu4_1 0 NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF MAKING YOUR OWN VERSUS BUYING A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT
Gwb5TRtcGu4_2 0 NOW I KNOW THAT THE PROSPECT OF MAKING YOUR OWN CLEANSER CAN SEEM A LITTLE DAUNTING BUT REALLY IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH EASIER THAN YOU WOULD THINK IT'S SO MUCH CHEAPER THAN BUYING OVER THE COUNTER
Gwb5TRtcGu4_3 0 IT CAN ALSO BE VERY REWARDING ONCE YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE PUTTING ON YOUR SKIN
Gwb5TRtcGu4_4 0 AS I MENTIONED FOR THE MOST PART MAKING YOUR OWN CAN BE CHEAPER THAN THE COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS
Gwb5TRtcGu4_5 0 IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THESE INGREDIENTS HERE AND GO INTO YOUR STORY AND REALIZE THAT ALL YOU'RE DOING IS JUST BUYING VERY INEXPENSIVE PRODUCTS
Gwb5TRtcGu4_6 0 BUYING MILK HONEY AND BOATS ALL OF WHICH YOU CAN PURCHASE IN JUST ABOUT ANY STORE AND PURCHASE IT JUST ABOUT ANY PRICE
Gwb5TRtcGu4_7 0 IF YOU GO TO BUY OVER THE COUNTER COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS THOSE ARE GOING TO BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE
Gwb5TRtcGu4_8 0 YOU CAN USUALLY SPEND UP TO FIVE DOLLARS SEVEN DOLLARS A BOTTLE
Gwb5TRtcGu4_9 0 AND FOR THIS YOU SPEND AT LEAST THAT MUCH FOR SO MUCH MORE
Gwb5TRtcGu4_10 0 THERE'S ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY IN COST YOU CAN'T FIND IF YOU BUY COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS
Gwb5TRtcGu4_11 0 IF YOU GO UP TO THE COUNTER ALL THERE IS JUST ONE PRICE FOR THAT ONE BOTTLE
Gwb5TRtcGu4_12 0 WHEREAS IF YOU NEED TO SAVE A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND DO SOME SHOPPING AROUND TO FIND SOME CHEAPER MILK AND MAYBE FIND SOME CHEAPER HONEY MAYBE EVEN FIND A LOCAL BEEKEEPER WILL SELL IT TO YOU A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN IF YOU WERE TO BITE IN THE STORE
Gwb5TRtcGu4_13 0 YOU HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY THERE THEN IF YOU NEEDED TO JUST GO INTO THE DRUG STORE PICK UP A BOTTLE OFF THE CANNER THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SELECT YOU ANY CHEAPER THAN WHAT'S ON THE LABEL
g8qogDYpMGI_1 0 MY NAME IS ANTHONY AMOUNT OF MONEY AND I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHY LIGHTING
g8qogDYpMGI_2 0 NOW FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHY CAN BE ANYWHERE FROM A CRIME SCENE TO INSIDE A MEDICAL EXAMINERS FLAT
g8qogDYpMGI_3 0 SO YOUR LIGHTING IS VERY GOOD STREAMING IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU'RE REALLY PRESENTING FACTS
g8qogDYpMGI_4 0 ONE TYPE OF FLASH THAT I HAVE USED AND SOME TYPES OF FRIENDS OF PHOTOGRAPHY IS A RING FLASH
g8qogDYpMGI_5 0 THIS IS A FLASH THAT ACTUALLY GOES ON THE LENS OF MY CAMERA AND GETS EXTREMELY CLOSE TO WHAT I'M SHOOTING
g8qogDYpMGI_6 0 I WAS SHOOTING LET'S SAY HAIR OR SOME TYPE OF EVIDENCE ON SOMEBODY IS HAND I WOULD WANT THAT RING FLASH BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO DIRECTLY IT WHAT I AM PHOTOGRAPHING
g8qogDYpMGI_7 0 IF I WAS USING A FLASH THOSE MOUNTED ON TOP OF MY CAMERA LESS OF HIS HAND HELD WOULD BE SORT OF DIFFICULT
g8qogDYpMGI_8 0 SO OUR RING FLASH IS TYPE OF LIGHTING THAT YOU WOULD REALLY LIKE TO USE FOR FORENSIC TOP PHOTOGRAPHY
g8qogDYpMGI_9 0 ONE ALSO TYPE OF LIGHTING THAT YOU COULD USE IS JUST STILL LIGHTS
g8qogDYpMGI_10 0 MOST THE TIME THEY'RE NOT USE BECAUSE FRIENDS OF PHOTOGRAPHY IS REALLY TYPE OF LIGHTING YOU WANT TO USE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS HEAT BASE
g8qogDYpMGI_11 0 HE WOULD NOT BE GOOD TO USE IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT
g8qogDYpMGI_12 0 SO YOU REALLY WANT TO STICK WITH A MORE ARTIFICIAL FLASH TYPE FOR FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHY
g8qogDYpMGI_13 0 THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TYPES OF LIGHTING THAT I WOULD USE A FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHY

gA8_Za3kOHk_11 0 ANY ENDS THAT ARE ON EVEN
gA8_Za3kOHk_12 0 AND THEN AS I WORK MY WAY DOWN I'M GOING TO ROLL IT ON THE ROAD LITTLE TIGHTER THIS TIME

gj_clsvISbo_1 0 OKAY SOMETIMES IN SQUASH YOUR OPPONENT PUT YOU UNDER GREAT PRESSURE AND SO AS WE SHOT ALL YOUR TRADITIONAL A BACKHAND DROP SHOT WILL BE SOMEWHAT LIKE A MINI DROWN STROKE OR MANY VOLLEY ALL THE LIKE THAT

gj_clsvISbo_7 0 IN THIS SAME GOES FOR THE FOREHAND SIDE SO INSTEAD OF THIS ON YOUR IT'S LIKE THAT
gj_clsvISbo_8 0 SO YOUR OPPONENT HITS A PRETTY GOOD SHOT PIECES SEE I JUST GET THE RACKET THERE I'M NOT DOING LIKE A DROP SHOT A MORE TRADITIONAL ONE I'VE GOT A WRAP IT UP AND I'M JUST USING THE STRENGTH IN HIS BLOCKING THE BALL SO JUST GOES RIGHT ABOVE THE TIN

HiMH-JDTdM4_1 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS FOR THESE TIGHT CURVED OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T USE THE BELT LIKE THIS AND THIS ONE IS TOO BIG
HiMH-JDTdM4_2 0 SO WHAT YOU CAN USE YOU CAN USE THE CORNER OF THE WHEEL AND USE IT TO GRIND OUT THAT FICTION THEN WILL END UP LOOKING LIKE THIS
HiMH-JDTdM4_3 0 IT'S NOT A PERFECT GRIND
HiMH-JDTdM4_4 0 WE USE ANOTHER TOOL FOR THAT BUT YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN START TO BRING IT IN AND USE THAT TO CLEAN OUT MOST OF THE BOWL
HiMH-JDTdM4_5 0 ONCE YOU GET IT BASICALLY TO YOUR SHAPE WE HAVE ANOTHER TOOL THAT WILL CLEAN THAT UP
HiMH-JDTdM4_6 0 THIS IS THE GRINDER THAT I USED TO DO THE LITTLE FINGER CUT OUT
HiMH-JDTdM4_7 0 IT HAS A ONE INCH WHEEL ON THE TOP AND IT FITS PERFECTLY INTO WHERE I WANT MY FINGER CUT UP SO YOU AROUND THIS PART RIGHT HERE

HiMH-JDTdM4_10 0 THIS MACHINE ACTUALLY HAS A SPEED ADJUSTMENTS WE CAN ADJUST THE SPEED THAT I NEED TO GRIND THAT IF IF
h55Pdut4MA4_1 0 SENDING STUFF BACK HOME IS ALSO AN OPTION
h55Pdut4MA4_2 0 ON SOME OF MY TOURS YOU GO FROM PLACES WHERE IT'S COLD TO PLACES WHERE IT'S HOT
h55Pdut4MA4_3 0 AND SO YOU START GOING THE POST OFFICE IN TOWN AND SENDING HOME US WITH THAT COLD WEATHER GEAR YOU DON'T NEED INSIDE I'VE ACTUALLY SEND HOME SOME OTHER STUFF
h55Pdut4MA4_4 0 ONE OF THE THINGS I SEND HOME IS ONCE I GOT THROUGH THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS WHERE THERE'S A LOT LESS CIVILIZATION I SEND HOME MY WATER FILTER
h55Pdut4MA4_5 0 BUT WHILE I WAS IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS WHEN YOU'RE IN YOU TIE YOUR IN THE DESERT AND OUR THERE'S VERY LITTLE CIVILIZATION WRAP A WATER FILTER IS REALLY NICE THING TO HAVE
h55Pdut4MA4_6 0 I'VE FILTER DROP WATERFIELD WATER FROM UNDER OUT FILTERED WATER FROM UNDER RAILROAD TRESS SOLES OF YOU KNOW UNDER FREEWAY OVER THAT YOU CAN'T BELIEVE WHERE I'VE GOTTEN WATER AND THE YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE GOT A GOOD WATER FILTER LIKE THIS ONE IS YOU KNOW YOU TEND TO YOU TEND TO BE PRETTY MUCH OKAY OF THE FILTERS TECHNOLOGIES PRETTY GOOD ON THESE FILTERS NOW
h55Pdut4MA4_7 0 SO ONE THING TO BRING ALONG MAYBE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BRING A WHOLE FILTERS JUST IODINE TABLETS
h55Pdut4MA4_8 0 THAT WAY AND PINCH IT'S A LOT LESS WEIGHT AND BOTH IN A FILTER AND PAINTS YOU CAN JUST USE IODINE TABLETS TO MAKE SURE WATER'S REASONABLY POSSIBLE
h55Pdut4MA4_9 0 BUT IT'S A SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT GOES ALONG WITH THE KITCHEN KIT AND YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THAT WATER FILTER OR IF YOU THINK YOU NEED IT EGG
h55Pdut4MA4_10 0 AGAIN MOST AREAS ARE INHABITED ENOUGH
h55Pdut4MA4_11 0 YOU KNOW I CERTAINLY DIDN'T HAVE A WATER FILTERING KENTUCKY OR GINYARD AS THEY'RE YOUR CHANCES OF PLACES LIKE YOU THOUGHT NEVADA A YOU KNOW WYOMING MONTANA OF OUT HERE IN THE WEST A WATER FILTER CAN PROVE TO BE SOMETHING THAT GIVES YOU THAT SWEET NECTAR OF LIFE WHEN YOU REALLY REALLY NEED IT
gNOe0UogfY0_1 0 HELLO EVERYONE I'M DAVID RODRIQUEZ HORTICULTURIST WITH TEXAS <UNK> EXTENSION SERVICE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME GARDENING STEPS IN PREPARING YOUR VEGETABLE GARDEN FOR THE SPRING PLANTING
gNOe0UogfY0_2 0 PLANTS ARE LIKE YOU IN ME THEY HAVE TO EAT PROBABLY MORE THAN I DO BUT YOU NEED THOSE NUTRIENTS TO GET GOOD YIELDS ON THESE PLANTS REMEMBER VEGETABLES ARE VERY SHORT TERM PLANTS
gNOe0UogfY0_3 0 I LIKE TO INCORPORATE A GOOD AMOUNTS OF ORGANIC FERTILIZER THAT INITIAL PLANTING
gNOe0UogfY0_4 0 NOW THE THREE NUMBERS ON A FERTILIZERS NITROGEN PHOSPHOROUS IN POTASSIUM ORGANIC FERTILIZER TEN NOT TO BE AS HIGH AS IN ORGANIC CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS BUT INITIAL PLANTING INCORPORATE TO THE THREE POUNDS FOR EVERYONE UNDER SQUARE FEET OF A GOOD ORGANIC ANALYSIS INCORPORATE INTO THAT COMPOST THAT INITIAL PLANTING BUT ONCE THOSE VEGETABLES GET GOING THEY GET HUNGRY
gNOe0UogfY0_5 0 SO YOU HAVE TO USE A HIGH DECELERATED NITROGEN LIKE AN EIGHTEEN SIX TWELVE NINETEEN FIVE NINE OR TWENTY ONE SEVEN FOURTEEN EVERY TWO TO THREE WEEKS THROUGHOUT THE GROWING SEASON JUST PUT IT ON THE SIDE OF THE PLANT AND WATERED IN REAL WELL
gqdh_ETC5uA_1 0 GO AHEAD AND STOP IT ONCE THAT BASKET IS FULL THE NEXT THING THAT I DO IS SETTLE THE COFFEE WHICH IS THIS MOTION HERE AND I SAY LOOK I SELL IT USUALLY A COUPLE TIMES
gqdh_ETC5uA_2 0 ONE THING IS EVERY TO EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT YOU SETTLE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIT ANOTHER GRAM OF COFFEE AND IN THE BASKET AND SO THAT'S ONE AND THAT'S WHY YOU DO THAT
gqdh_ETC5uA_3 0 NOW THAT I'VE SETTLE THAT I CAN FIT A LITTLE MORE COFFEE IN THERE AND JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THERE
gqdh_ETC5uA_4 0 NOW THAT IS FILLED UP TAKE OFF THE TOP HERE AND I'M A LEVEL OFF THE COFFEE IN THE BASKET AND I'M JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND AND LEVEL IT OFTEN AND PUT IT RIGHT BACK INTO THE DOSING CHAMBER AND THEN WE CAN DUMP IT LATER
gqdh_ETC5uA_5 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING IS NOT ONLY LEVELING IT OFF SO THAT YOU HAVE A NICE EVEN FLAT SURFACE ON THE TOP OF THE BASKET BUT ALSO KIND OF PUSH AROUND THE COFFEE IN THE BASKET SO THAT THE COFFEE IS COMPLETELY EVENLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BASKET
gqdh_ETC5uA_6 0 IT KIND OF WIPE IT OFF HERE
gqdh_ETC5uA_7 0 THE REASON THAT YOU DO THAT IS SO THAT YOU GET THE COFFEE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED IF YOU HAVE THE COFFEE IN ONE AREA OF THE POCKET THAT IS LAST EVENLY DISTRIBUTED YOU HAVE LESS COFFEE THAN ANOTHER AREA IN THE POT AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE PATH OF LEASH RESISTANCE THAT THE WATER IS GOING TO IS GOING TO TRAVEL THROUGH WHEN YOU'RE BREWING ESPRESSO AND WHICH IS AN EXTRACTION FLY WHICH IS GOING TO END UP AND THE END PRODUCT OF THE CUP OF ESPRESSO
h4UT3ywS2_4_1 0 AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE THIS IS SONJIA CUHER
h4UT3ywS2_4_2 0 WRINKLE YOU MAY LAUGH BUT THIS IS MY WRINKLE PIECE OF PLASTIC BACK AND I WOULD PAY FOR IT ADULT
h4UT3ywS2_4_3 0 A COUPLE YEARS AGO LIKE THAT I REALLY EXPENSIVE CALL IT THE GOURD TAGS AND KEEP DRAIN THE HOLE AND MEAN THE WHOLE WHEAT THAT I WAS IN THERE IN THE HIND LEGS SO NO MATTER HOW WE CAN SEE WITH MY COATS WHAT'S GOING TO ASK THE BACON THAT'S THE BEST THING IT WORKS THE GRAPE SEED AND GET WET THAT MAKE YOU WOULD SET BUT THESE WOULD EFFECTS YOU
h4UT3ywS2_4_4 0 REMEMBER TO HIS CLIMATE IT VARIES
h4UT3ywS2_4_5 0 WE ONLY HAVE TWO SEES IT'S DRY SEES SUN AND WET SEASON
h4UT3ywS2_4_6 0 THE DRY SAYS IT'S COLD ANY DRY
h4UT3ywS2_4_7 0 AND WHAT SEASON YOU WILL GET WET
h4UT3ywS2_4_8 0 IT'S REALLY DRAINS SOME YOU KNOW IF PORES LIKE CATS AND DOGS THAT'S THE EXPRESSION
h4UT3ywS2_4_9 0 AND ALSO REMEMBER WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CLEMENTS BECAUSE SO THAT THE CORDING YOU GET ALL OF THESE RANGE
h4UT3ywS2_4_10 0 SO BY THE COAST LINE WE HAVE IS JUST SORT OF LIKE A MILD WINTER MILE SUMMER
h4UT3ywS2_4_11 0 IN THE HIGH LENS DRY AND WET AND IN THE HIGH AND IT'S ALL WITH HOT AND WAIT
gMFxIZ3fST0_1 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO APPLY THE WHITE BASE PAINT TO THE BOXES
gMFxIZ3fST0_2 0 AND THIS WILL HELP US GIVE A SOLID WHITE COLOR TO THE BOXES AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO DECORATE THE DECORATE THEM ACCORDINGLY
gMFxIZ3fST0_3 0 SO WE CAN SEE AS WE APPLY THIS WHITE PAINT IT'S A VERY THICK HEAVY PAINT AND IT COVERS COVERS ALL THE MARKS ON OUR BOX
gMFxIZ3fST0_4 0 SO THIS WAY WE WON'T BE LEFT WITH ANY TYPE OF WRITING OR COLORS UNDERNEATH THE COLORS WE WANT TO USE TO DECORATE OUR BOX
gMFxIZ3fST0_5 0 DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU HAVE UNDERNEATH YOU DON'T REALLY NEED MORE THAN ONE COAT
gMFxIZ3fST0_6 0 BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME VERY DARK IMAGES UNDERNEATH THAT STILL LOOK LIKE THEY'RE COMING THROUGH SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO WAIT TILL IT DRIES AND YOU CAN APPLY AND TOUCH UP IN CERTAIN AREAS A SECOND COAT
gMFxIZ3fST0_7 0 DON'T APPLY TOO MUCH BECAUSE IT IS A VERY THICK PAINT AND IT GOES ON VERY HEAVY
gMFxIZ3fST0_8 0 ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE TO TAKE SOME COLORED PAPER AND JUST COVER THE THE AREAS SO WE CAN GLUE THE AREAS AROUND WITH A COLORED CARDBOARD
gMFxIZ3fST0_9 0 AND OBVIOUSLY THAT WITH SKIP THE WHOLE STEPS OF PAINTING THE BOXES AND EVEN THOUGH THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO JUST COVER IT WITH COLORED PAPER
gMFxIZ3fST0_10 0 LEAVING OUT THE THE PAINT FROM THIS PROJECT IS KIND OF A A KIND OF A DOWNSIDE FOR FOR KIDS REALLY ENJOY PAINTING
gMFxIZ3fST0_11 0 SO I'M SHOW AND ENJOY ARE MUCH MORE GOING THROUGH THE STEPS OF COVERING THE BOX AND COLORING IT
gMFxIZ3fST0_12 0 BUT AGAIN IF YOUR SHORT ON TIME OR YOU JUST WANT TO USE WHAT MATERIALS YOU HAVE AVAILABLE TO YOU IT COULD ALSO BE COLORED IN THAT WAY
gMFxIZ3fST0_13 0 JUST BY PAINTING DIFFERENT BY PASTING TAPING DIFFERENT COLORED PAPER AROUND THE BOX
gMFxIZ3fST0_14 0 YOU GET THE SAME EFFECT
gMFxIZ3fST0_15 0 SO WE CAN SEE THIS PAINT REALLY COVERS UP WHAT'S UNDERNEATH
gMFxIZ3fST0_16 0 SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO NECESSARILY LOOK SPECIFICALLY FOR BOXES THAT DON'T HAVE ANY IMAGES ON THEM OR ARE TOTALLY CLEAN
gMFxIZ3fST0_17 0 YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS PAINT REALLY GIVES A VERY THICK LAYER THAT WILL LET THE COLORS THAT YOU PUT ON TOP OF IT SHINE THROUGH
gsE5eVP7poQ_1 0 AFTER YOU DECIDE I WOULD PLACE TO USE
gsE5eVP7poQ_2 0 LIKE I HAVE
gsE5eVP7poQ_3 0 I'M GOING TO USE STEEL BLUE AND WHEAT FIELD
gsE5eVP7poQ_4 0 OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A PRETTY BLUE COLOR
gsE5eVP7poQ_5 0 IT'S VERY BEAUTIFUL
gsE5eVP7poQ_6 0 AND AS WE FIELD IS CLOSE TO TO THIS TONE
gsE5eVP7poQ_7 0 IT'S A LIKE A FAN COLOR
gsE5eVP7poQ_8 0 SO YOU WANT TO SHAKE THEM OF REALLY REALLY WELL
gsE5eVP7poQ_10 0 THAT WAY ALL THE PIECES AND PARTICLES AT THE BOTTOM MIX WITH THE TOP
gsE5eVP7poQ_11 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO HAVE SOME TYPES OF STIR STIR
gsE5eVP7poQ_12 0 I USE THIS RIGHT HERE ACTUALLY
gsE5eVP7poQ_13 0 JUST TO MIX IT TOGETHER SO THAT YOUR APPLICATION IS EVEN
gsE5eVP7poQ_14 0 SOMETIMES IT'S PRETTY THICK
gsE5eVP7poQ_15 0 IF IT'S TOO THICK ADD WATER
gsE5eVP7poQ_16 0 JUST SLOW AMOUNTS OF WATER
gsE5eVP7poQ_17 0 IF YOU ADD TOO MUCH OBVIOUSLY THE COLOR IS NOT GOING TO BE IS NICE AND RICH AS YOU WANT
gsE5eVP7poQ_18 0 SO YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE TO GET ALL OF THE GLAZE MIXED REALLY WELL
gsE5eVP7poQ_19 0 AGAIN THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT
gsE5eVP7poQ_20 0 I'VE LEARNED THE HARD WAY WITH THIS
gsE5eVP7poQ_21 0 SO ONCE YOU'VE MIXED IT WELL I'M GOING TO PUT THE TILL BLUE ON THE OUTSIDE AND THE WHEAT FIELD ON THE INTERIOR
gsE5eVP7poQ_22 0 DECIDE WHAT PAINT BRUSH
gsE5eVP7poQ_23 0 THIS IS THE SIZE OF MY PIECE SO I'M GOING TO NEED A SMALL PAINT BRUSH SOME BUT I LIKE THICKER BRUSHES THAT WAY THEY PUT IN MORE CLAY

G4CzvKfH9AE_1 0 NOW THE OPPOSITE OF THE HAMMER ON IS A PULL OFF
G4CzvKfH9AE_2 0 THE LAST CLIP WE NOTED THE HAMMER OF MINT YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY A NOTE AND DRIVE YOUR FINGER OF YOUR FRETTING HAND INTO THE FRET BOARD AND THE FORCE OF YOUR FINGER IN THE STRING MAKING CONTACT WITH THE FRET WILL ALLOW THAT NEXT NOTE THE SECOND NOTE TO RING OUT
G4CzvKfH9AE_3 0 RATHER THAN PICKING THE NOTE TWICE WE'D HAVE YOU KNOW A PULL OFF IS JUST THE OPPOSITE
G4CzvKfH9AE_4 0 WE'RE GOING TO START WITH A NOTE AND RATHER THEN PICKING THE SECOND NOTE AND WE'RE GOING TO PICK THE FIRST NOTE IN THE WHOLE THE FINGER OFF OF THE STRING DOWN AND AWAY FROM THE STRING
G4CzvKfH9AE_5 0 SO THAT INSTEAD OF PICKING WITH THE RIGHT HAND ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE JUST GRIPPING THE STRING WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND FINGER AND PULLING IT BACK ALLOWING THAT STRING TO WRING IT OUT
G4CzvKfH9AE_6 0 NOW AGAIN YOU CAN DO THAT TO AN OPEN STRING OR YOU CAN KEEP A FINGER FRETTED AND PLAY A NOTE THAT WILL PULL OFF TO THAT NOW
GdSH7P6cZEc_1 0 THE NEXT TECHNIQUE WE'RE GOING TO DO IS ADDING HERE
GdSH7P6cZEc_2 0 SO UP FIRST WE'LL DO ADDING HAIR TO A BASIC THREE STRAND BRAID
GdSH7P6cZEc_3 0 SO ON TO ANOTHER LITTLE PARTING LIKE THIS
GdSH7P6cZEc_4 0 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KEEP THE HAIR CLIP AWAY FROM THE SECTION THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON SO THAT YOU DON'T GET HERE I'M CAUGHT UP IN THE SECTION THAT YOU ARE WORKING ON
GdSH7P6cZEc_5 0 FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO ADD A PIECE OF HAIR
GdSH7P6cZEc_6 0 SO IT'S STILL THE SAME TECHNIQUE
GdSH7P6cZEc_7 0 YOU STILL START WITH THE THREE PIECES
GdSH7P6cZEc_8 0 BUT FIRST WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS WRAP THE HERE AROUND PUSHING IT AS CLOSE TO THE BASE HOLDING IT AS CLOSE TO THE BASE AS POSSIBLE
GdSH7P6cZEc_9 0 YOU WANT TO HOLD THEIR HAIR BETWEEN YOUR FOREFINGER YOU DOWN
GdSH7P6cZEc_10 0 THEN YOU WANT TO SECTION THIS THAT THE HAIR THAT YOU ADD
GdSH7P6cZEc_11 0 YOU WANT TO ADD A SMALL PIECE INTO THEIR HAIR UP SO THAT YOU HAVE YOUR THREE STRANDS JUST LIKE YOUR REGULAR THREE STRAIN BRAID
GdSH7P6cZEc_12 0 YOU WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THE SAME TECHNIQUE
GdSH7P6cZEc_13 0 TAKE THE LEFT SIDE BRING IT TO THE MIDDLE
GdSH7P6cZEc_14 0 BRING THE MIDDLE TO THE LEFT
GdSH7P6cZEc_15 0 THERE YOU GO
GdSH7P6cZEc_16 0 YOU WANT TO TAKE THE RIGHT SIDE BRING IT TO THE MIDDLE
GdSH7P6cZEc_17 0 AND IT OVER TO THE RIGHT
GdSH7P6cZEc_18 0 SAME EXACT TECHNIQUE HIGH BUT YOU'RE HOLDING UP THE HERE AS CLOSE TO THE SCALP IS POSSIBLE SO THAT THE SYNTHETIC HAIR THAT YOU ADD IT DOES NOT SLIDE
GdSH7P6cZEc_19 0 SMOOTHING ALL THAT HERE SO YOU CAN MAKE IT ALL THE LAND
GdSH7P6cZEc_20 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE WHEN ADDING HERE THAT YOU WRAP THAT HERE TIGHTLY AROUND YOUR FINGER SO THAT IT STAYS FLAT
GdSH7P6cZEc_21 0 USING YOUR FINGER UNDERNEATH AS A BASE SO THAT THE BRAID DOESN'T MOVE IN SPACE FLAT
GdSH7P6cZEc_22 0 THIS FINGER UNDER THE BRAID IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS TECHNIQUE BECAUSE IT HELPS TO KEEP THE BRAID CONSISTENT
GdSH7P6cZEc_23 0 AND IT GIVES IT A GOOD BASE AND FOUNDATION WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT
GdSH7P6cZEc_24 0 AND IT ALSO CONTROLS THE TIGHTEN THIS UP THE BRAID
GdSH7P6cZEc_25 0 SO THE STICK IN MY FINGER HERE WRAPPING THIS BEHIND IT IN AND AROUND MY FINGER TIGHTLY IS MAKING THE BRAID ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO BE TIGHT
GdSH7P6cZEc_26 0 BECAUSE IF I DIDN'T DO THAT I CAN JUST DO THIS AND JUST GRAB THE STRANDS LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE DO
GdSH7P6cZEc_27 0 LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE BRAID
GdSH7P6cZEc_28 0 IT GIVES YOU A MUCH LOOSER BRAID WHICH SOMETIMES IS GOOD IF YOU WANT LOOSE BRAIDS
GdSH7P6cZEc_29 0 BUT LOOK AT OUR THE EXCESS HAIR THAT LEAVES OUT WHEN YOU'RE GNAT WRAPPING AND YOU'RE JUST BRAIDING
GdSH7P6cZEc_30 0 ESPECIALLY WHEN HERE IS AT IT
GdSH7P6cZEc_31 0 SO YOU WANT TO WRAP WRAP WRAP WRAP ALMOST AS IF YOU'RE PUSHING IT UP AND BEHIND YOUR FINGER
GdSH7P6cZEc_32 0 IT GIVES YOU A MUCH TIGHTER BRAID
GdSH7P6cZEc_33 0 BUT SOMETIMES YOU JUST WANT TO LOOSE BRAID YOU JUST DO THE SAME TECHNIQUE
GdSH7P6cZEc_34 0 YOU JUST DON'T RAFT IS TIGHT
GdSH7P6cZEc_35 0 AND THIS IS HOW YOU DO EXTENSIONS
GdSH7P6cZEc_36 0 EXTEND THE HERE BY ADDING IN JUST BRAIDING IT IN

gqkc-eW6Qo4_9 0 ONE PERSONAL TRAINERS ARE SETTING UP THE EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR ONE PERSON OR MULTIPLE PEOPLE THEY MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE PROGRAMS ARE INDIVIDUAL EYES
gqkc-eW6Qo4_10 0 SO THEY SIT THEM DOWN AND THEY NORMALLY HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH THEM WHERE THEY BASICALLY ASK THE PERSON WHAT THEY WANT THEIR GOAL IS TO BE THERE HEALTH THEIR PAST HISTORY WITH EXERCISE SO THAT THEY MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM THAT THEY SET UP FOR THEM IS GOING TO HELP THEM BE SUCCESSFUL AND THEY'RE GOING TO HIT THEIR GOAL
gqkc-eW6Qo4_11 0 PERSONAL TRAINERS WORKING ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF ATMOSPHERE

gqkc-eW6Qo4_20 0 THEY NEED TO NOT ONLY KNOW HOW TO DEMONSTRATE THEM THEY NEED TO KNOW HOW TO USE THEM PROPERLY
gqkc-eW6Qo4_21 0 IN MOST GYMS PERSONAL TRAINER SHED UNDERSTANDS WHAT TYPE OF EQUIPMENT THEY'RE USING AND HOW THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE WAY IS TO USE IT
gqkc-eW6Qo4_22 0 WHEN THEY'RE DEMONSTRATING THE RIGHT WAY HOW TO DO AN EXERCISE THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY MAKE A CLEAR WITH OUR CLIENT THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING BEFORE THE CLIENT GOES OUT THERE AND PERFORM THE EXERCISE
gqkc-eW6Qo4_23 0 AND IN THIS ACTIVE METHOD EXAMPLE FOR A TRAINER WOULD BE TO DO THAT EXERCISE WITH THEM
gqkc-eW6Qo4_24 0 A PERSONAL TRAINER SHOULD NEVER BE DOING AN EXERCISE WITH THE CLIENT
gqkc-eW6Qo4_25 0 THEY SHOULD BE OBSERVING THE CLIENT SO THE CLIENT

GxkICAM1cqg_3 0 AND TODAY I'M GOING TO DISCUSS THE CONTROVERSIAL AND BANNED ALCOHOL COMMONLY KNOWN AS ABSINTHE
GxkICAM1cqg_4 0 SO WHEN YOU THINK ABSINTHE THE NUMBER ONE INGREDIENT EVERYONE THINKS OF WHERE THE NUMBER ONE EFFECT REALLY THEREBY THINGS OF IS THE HALLUCINATION THAT EVERYBODY REALLY PUT TOGETHER WITH ABSINTHE WHERE EVERYBODY HERE IS ABOUT
GxkICAM1cqg_5 0 WELL THAT INGREDIENT IS WARM WHAT AND THAT'S REALLY THE REASON WHY IT HAS BEEN BAND HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES BUT A LOT OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE BRINGING IT BACK
GxkICAM1cqg_6 0 BECAUSE THEY ARE FINE UNLESS EFFECTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WE'RE TAKING DIFFERENT PROCESSES TO BREW IT WITHOUT THE TOXINS THEIR NORMAL TOXINS THAT COME FROM WARM WHAT THAT REALLY GIVE THESE HALLUCINOGENIC AFFECTS OR SIDE EFFECTS TO THE DRINK
GxkICAM1cqg_7 0 NOW IF YOU GO IN THE FDA WEBSITE WERE ORIGINALLY BAND THE ABSENT PRODUCT CONTAINING WORMWOOD YOU'LL SEE IT THE POSSIBLE HEALTH HAZARDS
GxkICAM1cqg_8 0 IT SAYS NOR LOGICAL SYMPTOMS CHARACTERIZED BY AND NUMBNESS OF LEGS AN ARM'S LOSS OF INTELLECT DELIRIUM AND PARALYSIS
GxkICAM1cqg_9 0 NOW THIS IS PROBABLY IF YOU CONSUME TONS AND TONS OF THIS STRING
GxkICAM1cqg_10 0 AND CONSUMED ON A VERY MY NEW WHERE IT VERY MINIMAL LEVEL AND YOU KNOW A CONTROL LEVEL IT'S REALLY NOT GOING TO HAVE TOO MUCH OF AN EFFECT ON YOU
GxkICAM1cqg_11 0 SOMETIMES YES YOU'LL DEFINITELY FEEL A LITTLE BIT OF A AND DELIRIUM EFFECT WHICH I HAVE IN ENCOUNTER A FEW TIMES DRINKING THIS BUT YOU REALLY JUST BE SAFE ABOUT IT
GxkICAM1cqg_12 0 NOW WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK INTO WORMWOOD WHITE DOES THIS WELL IT CONTAINS I'VE EVEN BELIEVE IT'S CALLED A PUSH ON I'M NOT REALLY SHORT THAT'S THE CORRECT PRONUNCIATION BUT IT'S A CHEMICAL VERY CLOSE TO WHAT'S IN MARIJUANA KNOWN AS TH SEE
GxkICAM1cqg_13 0 AND SINCE THAT THE FDA IS PLACED IN THE WORMWOOD HERB IN THE ON SAFE CATEGORY
GxkICAM1cqg_14 0 IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT THIS CHEMICAL IN THE WORMWOOD MAY CAUSE THE NERVE DAMAGE ANOTHER SIDE EFFECTS
GxkICAM1cqg_15 0 SO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DRINK IT OR OR USE WORMWOOD PRODUCTS WHICH IS YOU KNOW OF READILY EASILY DEFINE MAYBE YOU KNOW CONSULT WITH A MEDICAL PHYSICIAN FIRST
GxkICAM1cqg_16 0 BUT REALLY IF YOU DO IT ON A ON A BASIS OR YOU KNOW YOU'RE TO CONSUME IT ON A SMART LEVEL YOU'RE NOT GOING TO REALLY RUN INTO AND THE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS
GeQZoFEa-aM_1 0 THE MARINE ORGANISM WE'RE GOING TO IDENTIFY NOW IS THE LONG FIN DAMSEL FISH
GeQZoFEa-aM_2 0 ONE OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE FISH ON THE CORAL REEF IS THE
GeQZoFEa-aM_3 0 DAMSEL FISH ALONG COULD DAMAGE THE FISH IS ONE OF THE LESS COMMON DAMSEL FISH SPECIES
GeQZoFEa-aM_4 0 A RELATIVELY LARGE DAMS A FISH USUALLY THREE TO FOUR INCHES LONG ALTHOUGH THEY CAN REACH A MAXIMUM SIZE OF FIVE INCHES
GeQZoFEa-aM_5 0 THE LONG CAN DAMAGE THE FISH WILL DEFENDERS TERRITORY VERY AGGRESSIVE LIKE
GeQZoFEa-aM_6 0 THEY'RE TERRITORY GENERALLY ONLY COVERS A SMALL AREA FOR EXAMPLE OF A SMALL CORAL HEAD IN THE SAND BUT THEY WILL ATTACK ANYTHING THAT GETS TOO CLOSE TO IT INCLUDING FISH MUCH LARGER THAN ITSELF
GeQZoFEa-aM_7 0 LONG CONDEMNS A FISH ARE SOMEWHAT CHALLENGING TO IDENTIFY SINCE THEY CAN BE EASILY CONFUSED WITH THE DUSTY DAMSEL FISH
GeQZoFEa-aM_8 0 WHAT DISTINGUISHES A TWO SPECIES ARE THE SHAPE AND LENGTH OF THEIR DORSAL IN ANAL FINS
GeQZoFEa-aM_9 0 ONCE IN DANCE THE FISH HAVE DORSAL IN ANAL FINS TO EXTEND WELL BE ON THE BASE OF THE TAIL AND USUALLY ARE MORE POINTED THEN ROUNDED
GeQZoFEa-aM_10 0 WHEREAS THE DUSTY DAMSEL FISH FINS AND JUST ADD OR JUST PAST THE BASE OF THE TAIL AND OUR ROUNDED
GeQZoFEa-aM_11 0 THE COLORATION OF THE LONG CAN DAMAGE THE FISH IS A DARK BROWN TO BLACK OVERS ENTIRE BODY IN FINS
GeQZoFEa-aM_12 0 ALTHOUGH THE PECTORAL FINS MAY APPEAR TO BE CLEAR
GeQZoFEa-aM_13 0 JUVENILE LONG FIN DAMS A FISH ARE VERY DIFFERENT LOOKING
GeQZoFEa-aM_14 0 THEY HAVE BRIGHT YELLOW BODIES WITH BRIGHT BLUE LINES THAT STARTED THE NOSE AND RUN ALONG THE BACK OFTEN BREAKING TO SPOTS INSTEAD OF A CONTINUOUS LINE
GeQZoFEa-aM_15 0 THEY'RE DISTINGUISH FROM THERE ARE OTHER SIMILARLY COLOR DAMS OF FISH JUVENILES BY A DARK SPOT RING IN BLUE ON THEIR DORSAL FIN
GeQZoFEa-aM_16 0 LUNCHEON DAMS A FISH CAN BE FOUND THROUGHOUT THE CARIBBEAN AND THE FLORIDA KEYS
GeQZoFEa-aM_17 0 BUT OR LESS COMMON THAN OTHER SPECIES OF DAMS A FISH SUCH AS THE BY COLOR DAMSEL FISH
GeQZoFEa-aM_18 0 THEY CAN BE FOUND AT DEPTHS RANGING FROM A FEW FEET TO DABS WELL BE ON SAFE DIVING LIMITS FOR RECREATIONAL SCUBA DIVERS
GeQZoFEa-aM_19 0 ALTHOUGH THEY'RE MOST COMMONLY FOUND IN DIAPSID LESSON EIGHTY FEET
GeQZoFEa-aM_20 0 THEY HAVE A RELATIVELY SMALL TERRITORY THEY PATROL AND RARELY RISE MORE THAN A FEW INCHES ABOVE THE SAFETY OF THEIR PATCH REEF OR CORAL HEAD
GeQZoFEa-aM_21 0 IF THEY FEEL THREATENED THEY WILL QUICKLY DUCK INTO A HOLE IN THE REEF BUT WE'LL FAIRLY QUICKLY
GeQZoFEa-aM_22 0 A REEMERGE ONE COULD DAMAGE THE FISH LIKE ALL DAMSEL FISH FEED PRIMARILY ON ALGAE AND THEY TEND TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN PERSONAL ALGAE PATCH IN THEIR TERRITORY
GeQZoFEa-aM_23 0 LONG FAN DAMSEL FISH ALSO REPORTEDLY FEED ON VARIOUS WORMS HEIGHT GROINS SO PLANKTON AND
GeQZoFEa-aM_24 0 WHEN IT GETS LENGTHEN DAMSEL FISH EXIST AS SEPARATE MALE AND FEMALE SPECIMENS
GeQZoFEa-aM_25 0 ALTHOUGH THE COLOR PATTERNS DO NOT DIFFER
GeQZoFEa-aM_26 0 EGGS ARE LAID BY THE FEMALE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE REEF AND THEN THE MALE SWIMS OVER THEM TO FERTILIZE THEM
GeQZoFEa-aM_27 0 ONCE FERTILIZE THE MALE LONG FIN DANCING FISH GUARDS THE EGGS UNTIL THEY HATCH IT WILL BE MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN NORMAL PROTECTING THE AREA AROUND THE EGGS
GeQZoFEa-aM_28 0 ONCE HATCHED THE FIRE ON THEIR OWN
GeQZoFEa-aM_29 0 THAT'S THE LAWN FIN DAMSEL FISH
H2OE97e7fw8_1 0 HEY MY NAME IS CRISTY NIX SYSTEM BLESSINGS AND I'VE BEEN ASKED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO ZOOM OUT
H2OE97e7fw8_2 0 ZONING OUT IS ACTUALLY WHEN YOU'RE CONSCIOUS MIND SEEMS TO RELAX AND ALLOW YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND TO COME UP
H2OE97e7fw8_3 0 WHEN YOU'RE IN THE ZONE EVERYTHING SEEMS TO GO LIKE CLOCKWORK
H2OE97e7fw8_4 0 YOU'RE IN YOUR NATURAL RHYTHM AND YOU GET A PARKING SPACE THAT FRONT YOU'RE VERY AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND YOU BUT YOU'RE NOT REALLY INTERACTING WITH IT
H2OE97e7fw8_5 0 YOU'RE IN YOUR OWN LITTLE WORLD SO TO SPEAK AND WHAT THAT IS IS WHEN YOU ACTUALLY ALLOW YOURSELF TO SHIFTING CONNECT WITH YOUR DIVINE SOURCE OF YOUR HIGHER SELF AS IT BE
H2OE97e7fw8_6 0 AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF THAT IS INCREDIBLY POSITIVE AND IT'S FOR YOUR HIGHEST GOOD IT'S OF YOUR HIGHEST GOOD
H2OE97e7fw8_7 0 SO ZOOMING OUT IS ACTUALLY IF YOU CAN PRACTICE IT TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN DO THAT ON CUE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS AND HAVE SOMETHING JUST FLOW FROM THE HEART IT'S AMAZING THE WONDERFUL THINGS THAT CAN COME OUT OF ZONING OUT

gedjAg79VKQ_4 0 WHEN I START LEARNING CLUBS ACCEPT THAT LOOK FOR THE FIRST TWO WEEKS UNTIL IT FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO
gedjAg79VKQ_5 0 NOW IF YOU'RE GETTING TOO MUCH SPIN AND IT'S COMING BACK YOU ODDS ARE YOU'RE HOLDING IT TOO FAR UP ON THE CLUB
gedjAg79VKQ_6 0 NOW TO MAKE SURE YOU GET AS CLOSE TO THE CENTER OF BALANCE AS POSSIBLE WHEN YOU HOLD IT
gedjAg79VKQ_7 0 I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD WITH TWO IT'S MUCH EASIER TO HOLD HIM UP HERE BUT YOU HAVE A LOT LESS CONTROL WHEN YOU'RE AWAY FROM THE CENTER OF BALANCE

hJ_DMggaOS4_7 0 YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS HORSE HAS THAT INHERENT QUALITY THAT I SAY KIND OF PRESENTS SIMILAR TO A POLICEMAN WITH TWO LOADED GUNS FEELING TO THAT COW
hJ_DMggaOS4_8 0 ANOTHER HORSE WITHOUT THAT COWING IS THAT QUICK FOOTED MOVEMENT THAT MATCHES AND MIRRORS THE COWS MOVEMENT ANOTHER HORSE MIGHT NOT PERFORM QUITE TO THE DETAIL THAT WE NEED IT TO

h0MqVxue_jE_7 0 THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS BY TAKING PROBE IONICS WHICH ARE THESE
h0MqVxue_jE_8 0 THESE ARE AN EXCELLENT FOR A PRO BATIKS ALONG WITH AN ANTI MICROBIAL SUPPLEMENT TO HELP KILL SOME OF THE BAD BACTERIA AS WELL AS TAKING A REALLY GOOD FIBER SUPPLEMENT OR EVEN JUST SOME GROUND FLAXSEED TO HELP MOVE THE BACTERIA OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM
