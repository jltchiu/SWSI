WHEN YOU PLAY THE SKIP BOW YOU ANNOUNCE WHAT NUMBER YOU WISH IT TO BE AND THEN PLAY IS SO YOU WOULD PLAY THAT NUMBER SO THIS IS A SIX I SAY
SKIP BOA HAS NUMBERED CARDS FROM ONE TO TWELVE AND SPECIAL SKIP BOW CARDS WHICH ARE WILD CARDS
FROM HERE I'M GOING TO BRING THE FOOT DOWN STEP OUT BOW THE RIGHT HAND PERFORMS SCRAPING BLOCK AND IN THE BODY SNAPS INTO SIDE PUNCH
OKAY ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT TOOL THAT TO THAT YOU NEED WELL IT'S KINDA HARFORD INDIVIDUAL TO BUY A TOOL LIKE THIS WITH THIS IS ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT WE USE WHEN WE REPAIR PEOPLE'S BOWLS IS WHAT'S CALLED A BOW FRESH

HI MY NAME IS WINDY AND THIS IS HOW TO PLAY SKIP BOW
SKIP BOW IS A TWO TO SIX PERSON GAME THAT IS SORT OF LIKE A COMPETITIVE SOLITAIRE
OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE LOOKING FOR PONTI BOW IS GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT STYLE CUSTOMER TO LOOK FOR SPEEDBOAT
JUST LOOK FOR THE LITTLE BIT OF THE THE END THAT STICKS OUT OF THE CORE OF THE OF THE BOW AND PUT A LITTLE BIT OF GLUE ON THAT AND THEN SLIP THAT AND THROUGH THE LOOP
THEY'RE NOT STRAIGHT AHEAD AND THEY'RE NOT WEIGHT TURNED OUT LIKE A BOW ARENA
SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A QUALITY BOW IS THE THICKNESS OF THE UPHOLSTERY
YOU CAN ALSO DO THE SAME THING WITH YOUR BOW ARM
NOW THE OTHER TYPE OF BOW THAT YOU'LL SEE IS CALLED THE GERMAN BALL
YOU HOLD THE BOW SUCH AND JUST DRAW OUT ACROSS THE STRING LIKE SO
PARTS IN THE PIECES YOU MIGHT HAVE SECTIONS WHERE YOUR BOW IS MATCHING THAT LOUD AND THIS BY BLOWING REALLY REALLY HARD AND REALLY FAST
ANOTHER ASPECT TO BOWING WHILE PLAYING ARE USING ISN'T USING DIFFERENT BOAST BOW SPEEDS BECAUSE YOUR BOW ISN'T ALWAYS GOING TO BE GOING AT THE SAME PACE THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE PIECE
ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT I LIKE TO USE FOR CUTTING ANY LARGE LIMB IS THAT OF THE BOW SAW
THE BOW SAWS ONE OF THOSE SAWS THAT YOU'LL HAVE THAT YOU CAN HAVE FOR YEARS
YOU PROBABLY CUP TO A THREE OR FOUR INCH LIMB OFF YOUR OAK TREE OR YOUR MAPLE BY USING A BOW SAW
IF IT MEANS USING A BOW DRILL A HAND DRILL MOUTH PIECE YOU'RE CREATING ANY TWO TRAPS EVEN
IF YOU HAVE AMMONIA AND I TRY AND TANK BOW THE SAME TIME THAT YOU NEED TO DO SOME MAJOR SURGERY ON YOUR TANK TO TAKE YOUR PROBLEM AND FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS
IT STARTS WITH AN F BOW IN THE E FINDER DOT NET
WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE TO SIX INCHES OF THIS COLOR TO FIT THE BOW AND YOU CAN USE ANY COLOR YOU WANT
THE WAY I LIKE TO MAKE A FLOWER OUT OF TWO BLOOMS IS WE TAKE A BALLOON JUST LIKE THIS BLOWN UP ALMOST ALL THE WAY THAT YOU MAKE THE LOOP FOR LIKE WE DID WITH THE HEART AND TIE IT IN AND WHAT I'M GOING TO MAKE A GLOW AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO SQUEEZE THE BOW IN HALF AGAIN JUST LIKE THIS YOU DO HAVE ENOUGH ROOM IF YOU LEAVE A LITTLE BIT OF UNINFLATED ROOM IN THE BALLOON THEN WE TAKE ONE MORE GREEN BALLOON YOU CAN PUT A PINCHED OF TULIP TWIST ON THIS IF YOU WANT BUT I'M JUST GOING TO USE A REGULAR BUBBLE PUT THIS TO THIS THAT MAKES THE TOP OF YOUR FLOWER AND YOU CAN JUST FOLD AGAIN TO MAKE YOUR LEAVES FOR THAT WILL MAKE YOU A TO BLOOM FLOWER
NOW THE ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THE BOW YOU HAVE THE STICK AND YOU HAVE THE HAIR
THIS FIRST IS CALLED THE FRENCH BOW AND YOU'LL NOTICE IS PRETTY MUCH JUST SHAPE LIKE A LARGE VIOLIN BOW AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH HOW YOU HOLD IT JUST LIKE A LARGE VIOLIN BOW
