IF YOUR PAINT IF YOU'VE PAINTED IT IN YOUR RUBBER BANDS WOULD INTERFERE JUST PUT ON SOME PAPER CLIPS
YOU MIGHT EVEN TAKE A SPONGE AND PUT IT IN YOUR PAINT AND MAKE SPONGE DESIGNS
IT'S HARD TO PAINT ON IT'S GOING TO BE COMFORTABLE TO SET ON
SOMETIMES IT'S A LITTLE PIECE OF HARDEN PIGMENT IN THE PAINT BOTTLE ITSELF THAT COMES OUT AND IT MIGHT JUST BE THAT THE PAINTS OLD
I'VE GOT THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE TOOLS TO SING A STRAP IT WHAT'S CALLED A SQUEEGEE AND THIS IS A REALLY NEAT TOOL TO DO SOME REALLY COOL THINGS WITH PAINT INSTEAD OF USING A BRUSH
I'VE GOT SOME BASIC A ACRYLIC PAINT HERE
SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO BLOW ON THE PIECE TO GET THE ACCESS PAINT OFF BUT I FIND SOMETIMES THAT CREATES SOME DIRT MARK SO I TEND TO JUST SHAKE THE PIECE OFF
SOME PEOPLE WHO WILL DIP THE I'M PIECES AND DO A CLEAR GLAZE AND OTHERS CHOOSE TO PAINT IT ON
I REALLY LIKE THE NONABRASIVE NEST DIPPING BECAUSE REALLY YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING THE PIECE IS A WHOLE LOT WHEN YOU ARE PAINTING YOUR CLEAR GLAZE ON WHAT CAN HAPPEN IS YOU AS SOON AS THE PIECE GETS WET YOU RE ACTIVATE THE PAINT AND ONE OF PAINTS REACTIVATED IT'S VERY EASY FOR YOU TO START MOVING IT WHEN YOU ARE BRUSHING IT ON
WE ONLY DID TOP PIECE AT A TIME SO IT'S NOT JUST SERVE THE PAINT UNDERNEATH
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE GOING TO AGAIN YOU CAN EXTEND OUT YOU CAN EXPECT TO PAINT A HOOP A BAR YOU CAN EXPECT TO PAY ABOUT THEM ANYWHERE FROM TEN TO ABOUT FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR THE BALL YOU SMOKE
IF YOU CAN AFFORD L NICE COAT OF WHITE PAINT WOOD IS ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA ALSO IF THE CARPETING IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO TO VACUUM FOR INSTANCE THIS CARPET ISN'T THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CARPET WE ALL AGREE I'M SURE YOU CAN HAVE IT LIFTED UP WITH SOME NEWER CARPET IN FOR MAYBE UNDER THOUSAND DOLLARS IF NOT YOU LEAVE IT AND MAKE IT CLEAN
DOES IT NEED PAINT
THE SAME PLACE YOU BY THE FUN OF PAINT
IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO SKETCH DRAW PAINT DESIGN YOU HAVE MANY MANY OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU
SO WHETHER I'M SPACKLING COCKING SCRAPING NO MATTER WHAT WHATEVER FALSE FROM UP TOP INCLUDING REAL THICK PAINT DROPS IT'S NOT GOING TO BLEED THROUGH
MY NAME IS SCOTT MCKAY AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO PAINT BALL PAINT OFF OF YOUR VEHICLE
OR VENDORS TWO TIMES OF PAINT
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER IN PAINT IT'S USUALLY A WATER BASE LOT THICKER ON THE EASE OF GETTING IT OFF IT'S GENERALLY DEPEND ON HOW LONG IT'S BEEN ON THERE
THIS IS YOUR MORE OF A GENERIC PAINT IT'S USUALLY A VEGETABLE BASE OIL
YOU CAN COVER YOUR TWO WITH THE CRAFT PAPER FIRST AND THEN PAINT AND DECORATE ON THE CRAFT PAPER
WE ALSO IN OUR PAINT ON PATIENTS YOU USE A LOT OF GASTROINTESTINAL MEDICATIONS
IT'S A LAYOUT PAINT
THEY USE WHEN THEY GET THIS IT'S A BLUE TYPE OF PAINT
AND I CAN PAINT THIS PHOTOGRAPH EMULSION ONTO WATERCOLOR PAPER
NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PAINT THE STRAWBERRY WHICH THEY MADE FROM PLAYING MARS UPON HIGH YOU MADE IT AT THEY AGO IT'S TAKE OUT TO HARDEN UP
AND USUALLY WHEN WE ARE FINISHED WITH THE PAINTING WE WILL GO AROUND AND CLEAN UP ALL THE EXCESS PAINT AROUND BECAUSE ONCE THE PAINTS THERE IT'S GOING TO BE FIRED IN THE GLAZE
THIS LOOKS REALLY BAD BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF PAINT ON IT BUT IT'S STILL WORKS GREAT
AND YOU PUT A LITTLE MORE PAINT TOWARDS THE END OF YOUR BRISTLES
I'M SAYING OF PAINT IF YOU DROP YOUR BRUSH BY THE BEER
SO WHAT I'LL DO IS I'LL TAKE A LITTLE PAINT A LITTLE PINK PAINT AND I'M JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND GET THAT GO ON REAL QUICKLY UP AROUND HER CUTICLES DOESN'T EVEN MATTER THAT IT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT GETS UP THEIR CLOSE THE CUTICLE AND STARTS THE LAYERING PROCESS
NOW THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS IF YOU HAVE LIKE LITTLE I'M GETTING SOME LITTLE PIECES OF LIKE LITTLE BLOBBY IS IN MY PAINT THAT HAPPENS ONCE IN AWHILE I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHY THE CLEAN YOUR BRUSH AND START OVER GRAB ANOTHER ALL SPEC OF PAIN AND WILL KEEP GOING
MAKE SURE THAT BEFORE YOU PAINT ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE MEETING ALL THE REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO GET GREAT SERVICE FROM THAT PARTICULAR WEBSITE
SO I'M GOING TO APPLY THIS BASE PAINT OVER IT OVER THE MASKING TAPE AND THAT WILL HELP ME PLACE A NICE EVEN COAT OF COLORED PAINT ALONG THE PICTURE FRAME
ONCE YOU GET TO THAT POINT STOP HOLD FOR THIRTY SECONDS EASE OFF OF IT AND GO BACK AGAIN AND STRETCH UNTIL YOU KNOW YOU GET TO THAT POINT WE CAN WITHSTAND THE PAINT IS YOUR HANDS YOU'RE STRETCHING IT
THE GLASS AND MY RIGHT HAND CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS THE PAINT AND I AM DOING THE APPLYING OF THE PAINT OR THE HOT GLASS BELOW THE FLAME
NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT POURING UP OUR EXTERIOR PAINT
THE MEDIUM TO PUT IN THE PAINT TO KEEP IT IN THE FABRIC DRIES PRETTY QUICK
YOU NEED TO HAVE THREE DIFFERENT BRUSHES WATER TREASURE BRUSHED OUT OR ALCOHOL AND POSSIBLY A ANOTHER TELL TO KEEP ALL THE PAINT ON
SUCH AS GREASY SURFACES OR DUSTY CHALKY SERVICES AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PAINT STICKS INTO THOSE SERVICES
FINALLY WE HAVE THE PAINT
AND SO IS LITERALLY YOUR DURING YOUR PAINT
IF YOU LOOK INTO THE NIGHT SKY AND YOU WANT TO PAINT A MOON AND STARS THAT'S TOTALLY POSSIBLE
SO WHEN YOU GET TO STEP OR START GETTING HARD TO PAINT I'M SORRY AND TALKING MY THROW THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE STOCK AND IT IS
AND SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT WANT TO JUST TAKE YOUR FINGER JUST PULL THE PAINT IS SOMETIMES IT'LL DRYER ON INTO THE NEEDLE
THE SO TAKE THE WATER GO OVER THE PAINT LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN PULL COLORS OUT
HELLO MY NAME IS ORESTES GUADA FROM EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE GAME OF PAINT
WHICH YOU CAN PAINT SIDING WE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT ANYWAY THAT PORCH WAS RESTORED THERE WAS A CONCRETE FOR TO IT THAT'S ALL THAT WAS THERE
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT TEXTURE IN SOMETHING AND YOU JUST WANT TO USE IT AS AS A LAY DOWN MEDIUM YOU CAN ALSO USE THAT IN AND MIX IT WITH THAT COULD CAUSE IT IS A OIL YOU NEED TO USE THE MINERAL SPIRITS YOUR PAINT THINNER AND YOU CAN APPLY THAT I HAVE RIGHT ON TOP OF WHAT YOU JUST ROATH AND WILL BLEND IT IN AND STILL LEAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TEXTURE IF IT DOES WITH EFFECT THAT YOU WANT TO SPEND SMUDGES IN HERE
I GO AHEAD AND GET MY PAINT BRUSH WET GET MY BLACK TO DO LIKE THE WAX TO DO A PALM TREE JUST BECAUSE IT REALLY HAS A NICE CONTRAST WITH THE OTHER COLORS THAT I'M DOING
AND IT'S REALLY THE THE GOLDEN RULE IN PAINT BALL
THIS IS THE SIZE OF MY PIECE SO I'M GOING TO NEED A SMALL PAINT BRUSH SOME BUT I LIKE THICKER BRUSHES THAT WAY THEY PUT IN MORE CLAY
DECIDE WHAT PAINT BRUSH
IN THIS CASE YOU WOULD JUST PAINT THE EDGES ALSO
AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO PAINT A WOODEN FOOD TRAY
ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOUR BODY AND WHENEVER YOUR BODY IS TALKING TO YOU WHETHER IT'S TELLING YOU PAINT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ALWAYS REMEMBER TO FOLLOW WHAT YOUR BODY SAYS
IF YOU DO PAINT ON TAPE BE SURE YOU LAP UP OVER TO NOT UNDERNEATH YOUR ROLL UP UNDERNEATH THE PAINT
I'VE ALSO GOT SOME THESE ARE ACTUALLY A CLAY SCULPTURE TOOLS BUT YOU CAN USE THEM TO KIND OF PULL OUT LINES AND SHAPES WHEN YOU HAVE THE PAINT ON THE CANVAS
I ALSO HAVE THIS PUFFY PAINT WHICH IS USED ON ON IT'S MADE TO PUT ON CLOTHING BUT IT ACTUALLY IS A REALLY NEAT WAY TO APPLY PAINT TO YOUR CANVAS
THIS IS A TYPE OF PAINT THAT GOES OVER PUTS A LAYER ON TOP OF THE PICTURE FRAME
I'M GOING TO NEED SOME WHITE THICK BASE PAINT
I'LL NEED SOME PAINT AND GLUE
I'M ALSO GOING TO BE USING A PENCIL AND SOME PAINT BRUSHES THAT I HAVE A FEW MARKERS ON HAND TO HELP YOU WITH THE DECORATIONS
SO NOW I'VE SHOWN YOU HOW TO PAINT THE OUTSIDE OF THE PICTURE FRAME
BUT ANYTHING WILL DO A PAINT BRUSH OR EVEN YOUR FINGERS
PROBABLY YOU END UP PAINT LIKE THAT AND <UNK> CENTS A DOLLAR AND MUSCLE THAT THEY RESTAURANTS WHOLE WHOLE IT DOES THEY WILL LEAD YOU USE A TOILET AND LETS YOU I STAIN THAT PLACE OR YOU'RE EATING
AND THE LAST THING ACTUALLY I LIKE TO DO AFTER THAT LAYER IS YOU TAKE YOUR PALETTE KNIFE AND START MAKING SOME LITTLE GOUGES HERE IN THE PAINT
OTHERWISE WE JUST PAINT THE WHOLE THING DARK TO BEGIN WITH
NOW THAT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE IF I'M ROLLING MY BRUSH ON IN THE PAINT TO TRY TO GET A NICE POINT ON BECAUSE MY SURFER GUY IS GOING TO HAVE SPIKY HERE
TAKE YOUR PAINT AND ROLL IT A LITTLE BIT ON THE EDGE OF YOUR TOWEL WHATEVER YOU'RE USING TODAY UP WITH AND GIVE YOU A CHANCE HOW YOUR WATER A CHANCE TO FALL OUT
YOU JUST WANT TO KEEP YOUR BRANCHES WILL THEN YOU CAN AND TRY TO REALLY CAREFUL AND NOT TO MAKE A BIG BLOB BECAUSE IF YOU DO TOO MUCH PAINT ON THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NOT HAVE A MUCH DETAIL
THEY PAINTED ON THE PIECE OF STEEL THAT THEY WANT AND THEY'LL PUT THEIR PATTERN DOWN AND THEN THEY'LL USE WHEN I'M METAL SCRIBE OR SHARP OBJECT AND THEY'LL SCRIBE THROUGH THE PAINT ON TO THE STEEL
DON'T APPLY TOO MUCH BECAUSE IT IS A VERY THICK PAINT AND IT GOES ON VERY HEAVY
SO WE CAN SEE AS WE APPLY THIS WHITE PAINT IT'S A VERY THICK HEAVY PAINT AND IT COVERS COVERS ALL THE MARKS ON OUR BOX
NOW WE'RE GOING TO APPLY THE WHITE BASE PAINT TO THE BOXES
AND THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE SPINNING AROUND ON ONE FOOT AND THE CRITICAL PAINT HERE IS TO KEEP YOUR BALANCE
AND THAT SAY HEY I WANT TO SEEP INTO THE PAINT IS GAME SO JUST A MINUTE I'M GOING TO ACCESS TO YOU HOW TO SHOW ME
FOR DECORATING OUR LIZARD WE'RE GOING TO USE ACRYLIC PAINT SOME TEMPERA GLITTER PAINT AND WE'LL ALSO BE USING SOME SEQUENCE AND SOME GOOGLY EYES
I HOPE THAT THIS IS GIVEN YOU SOME IDEA OF THE VARIATIONS OF COMMONLY USE WATERCOLOR PAPERS AND JUST A IT CERTAINLY WILL AFFECT HOW YOU PAINT AND AND WHERE YOU CAN TAKE THESE PAPERS WHETHER IT'S OUTDOORS IN
SO IT'S ALSO EASY TO PAINT IT WHILE IT'S ON OF ON THE STICK BECAUSE A BALL IT'S HARD TO GRIP WHILE WHILE PAINTING IT SO THIS WAY GIVES THIS WAY TO HOLD ON TO THE BALL AND GET ALL SIDES UNDERNEATH AND ON TOP ALL AROUND THE BALL VERY EASILY WHILE IT'S ON THE STICK
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE STICK GETS PAINT ON IT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE INSERTED INTO THE MILK CARTON
NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PAINT THE STYROFOAM BALL BEING THAT THE STYROFOAM BALL IS GOING TO BE SITTING AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH IT'S GOING TO BE THE CENTER OF THE WINDOW WHERE ALL ALL THE ARMS ARE GOING TO BE HANGING
SOME OF THE MATERIALS THAT ARE NOT OKAY TO SAND ON OUR VENEERS AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHY IN JUST A SECOND TREATED LUMBER HAS CHEMICALS IN IT THAT COULD GET INTO THE AIR AND YOU COULD BREATHE THEM AND THEY COULD BE BAD FOR YOU IN ADDITION IF YOU HAVE ANY TYPE OF PAINTED WOOD THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE LEAD PAINT ON THEM
THIS IS GOING TO BE STRAIGHT PAINT
I'M GOING TO TAKE MY SLAP SIMPLY PAINT IT ON ALL THE SPOTS YOU PICK THE TOP SIDE OF MY HANDLE AND PRESS IT AGAINST THE MUG LIKE SO
AND THE MORE TIME IT TAKES TO PAINT A PAINTING THE LESS INCOME BASICALLY
AND AS YOU'LL SEE ON THIS GUY ON THIS PIECE HERE WHICH I'VE ALREADY LAID OUT THERE'S A NUMBER OF VERY INTRICATE DETAILS ON THIS THAT WE'VE TAKEN ME IN EXTRAORDINARY EXTRAORDINARILY LONG TIME TO ACTUALLY PAINT
OF COURSE AS WE LEARN ABOUT THE PATIENT THE PATIENT ACTUALLY LEARN AS A FEW THINGS ABOUT THEMSELVES THEY FIND THAT OTHER THINGS START TO GET BETTER AS WE TREAT THEM ABOUT PAINT
ACRYLIC PAINT IS A GREAT ALL PURPOSE PAINT FOR CRAPS
THERE'S BEEN SOME PAINT BLOWN UP THE LAST TIME IN THIS ONE IT'S MIXED INTO THE OIL
AND I AM LOOKING OVER THE NAILS I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE COLORS THAT WE'VE GOT SO FAR AND I THINK I WANT TO HAVE A TAD BIT OF RED SO I MIGHT JUST ON THE DRY BRUSH SO I GET A LITTLE BIT OF THAT RED PAINT ON THERE MARKS ON FOOT OFF AND JUST DO A TAD BET
SO YOU REALLY WANT TO PAINT TO ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH AWAY FROM YOUR TAPE LINE AND THEN FINISH THAT FAR WITH THE BRUSH
WHAT THEY DO IS WHEN YOU'RE PAINTING WITH THE ROLLER IS IT'S INTONATION DID GOAL IN PAIN ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TAPE LINE WHEN YOU'RE REALLY SHOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THE MORE PAINT YOU PUT ON THE TAPE YOU CREATE A SEAL SO THAT WHEN YOU PULL THE TAPE BACK YOU WIND UP PULLING THE PAINT AND MESSING UP A LOT OF GOOD WORK
YOU ALSO WANT TO ALWAYS USE SMOOTHLY THESE EASY STROKES AND BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVER PAINT YOUR ROPE PREPARATION LINE
AND THE PAPER IS HOT ON A GRETEL ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TOUCH THAT WAX BLOCK YOU SEE IN YOU CAN DIRECTLY TO PAINT WITH THE WAX
IT'S KIND OF TELL WITH BLACK BECAUSE YOU CAN PRESS BEING BLACK AS IT IS HARDER TO TELL WHAT HOW MUCH PAINT YOU'VE GOT ON THERE SO
THAT'S WHY I CHOSE TO USE THE METALLIC PAINT
AND YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH SIDE OF THE COIL YOU WANT TO USE BUT I LIKE TO USE THE SIDE BECAUSE IT HOLDS PAINT A LITTLE BIT OF THAT
AND REALLY HAVE KIDS OR A BUNCH OF PEOPLE GOING IN AS A STORE IT'S GOING TO SEE IT'S ABUSE AND THE PAINT AROUND IT WILL SEE IT'S ABUSE
HI THIS IS DAB NOW WE'RE GOING TO DEMONSTRATE HOW TO SMOOTH OUT THE WALL ONCE YOU PUT YOUR FIRST COAT OF PAINT ON IT
NOW IF YOU MOVE THIS IS GOING TO NOTICE THAT YOU START GETTING LINES IN YOUR PAINT
SO YOU JUST KIND OF HAVE TO THINK IN TERMS OF THE LAYERS GOING BACKWARDS VERSUS WHEN YOU PAINT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
HI I'M DAVID CLEMEN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO PAINT A PIECE OF GLASS INSIDE OF THE FRAME
SO NOW SO I'M GOING TO START WITH AND WHEN YOU PAINT WITH ACRYLIC ON GLASS YOU DON'T WANT TO USE ANY WATER ON THE PAINT BECAUSE IT TENDS TO STREAK IF YOU PUT WATER ON IT AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO IT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO HELP YOUR PAINTING AT ALL
SO AGAIN SYSTEMICALLY THERE'S A GRAY CORRELATION TO THE LOW BACK AND HOW THINGS WORK AS WELL AS WAS PAINT
WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO IS THAT THE SPINE IS REALLY THE HOUSE THAT PROTECTS THE NERVES THAT ARE TRANSMITTING THESE MESSAGES AND SO AS THE SPINE GETS MISALIGNED AS THE SPINE BECOMES TORQUED TWISTED WHAT HAVE YOU IT PUTS PRESSURE ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT THEN ASCENDING THE MESSAGES OUT AND WHICH CAN BE PAINT OR FUNCTION
SO PAIN FIBERS ARE BEING AFFECTED THEY'RE GOING TO FEEL PAINT THAT'S BURNING RADIATING PAINT LOCAL PAIN MUSCLE TENSION PRESSURE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS
SO USE A LOT OF PAINT MOTION AND JUST DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH I A EDGES ARE GOING TO KEEP THESE CARS THROUGH THE ESSENCE OF THE BOOK I I THAT I FIND IT
BLUE IS VERY HOT AND WE CAN TURN THIS UP TO IF YOU NEED TO PAINT
YOU GRAB YOUR PAINT IT YOU CAN READY AND KEEP THE THE HANDLE THE CAN OVER HERE SO THAT WHEN IT FLIPS IT DOESN'T GET ONTO THE HANDLE
YOU WANT TO SEE THE THE THE PAINT IT ON OUT SKIN THAT THE PAINT ON FAKE SKIN THAT THAT YOU JUST PUT ON YOUR FACE SO
THAT WAY IF ANY PAINT FLIES OVER YOUR SECOND WEIGHT ON THAT HANDLE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUR HANDS ON
YOU CAN ALSO GET STICKS THAT THE PAINT STORE
JUST MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FILL UP THE HOLES WITH THE PAINT
I CALL IT SPILLING THE PAINT BOX TO BUY DOES DESIGN
SO GO AHEAD AND GET YOURSELF A FULL OF PAINT
NOW WHEN YOU GO SIDEWAYS LIKE THIS YOU'LL GET MORE PAINT ON YOUR BRUSH
DAMPNESS IF THE LEG TENDS TO SWELL UP ON OR IF THE DOG RESPONDS AND IS WORSE IN WORST PAINT ON DAMP DAYS THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD POINT FOR YOU TO USE
IT'S LIKE IT'S GETTING TERRIBLY DULL PAINT
YOU CAN USE PAINT
IT'S ALMOST GLASSY AND THE PAINT SITS ON DIFFERENTLY
IT GIVES A REAL GOOD FULL SOUND AND THEN YOU WANT YOUR PAINT IT TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT REALLY EMPHASIZE THE WORDS THAT YOU'RE SINGING
THE PAINT AND WE'LL USE THE PURPLE ON FIRST GO UP UNDER BLUE LINE WHERE YOU HAVE ACROSS
IT STAYS OUT THAT GETS OF HARD TO CROSSED WHICH MAKES IT EASIER TO PAINT SO THIS IS THE STRAWBERRY THAT I MADE YOU CAN SEE THAT IS ALREADY SHAPED GOING TO DO ANYTHING WITH THE SHADES BUT WE'RE GOING TO COLOR IT
AND SOME OF THE THINGS YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT FIRST IS WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO PAINT YOUR INSIDE YOUR DESIGN FIRST OR WHETHER YOU WERE GOING TO DO THE OUTSIDE OF THE GOURD OR HOW MUCH IS GOING TO BE THE NATURAL BORDER SHOWING
YOU CAN ALSO USE IT ON WHAT THEY HAVE OUT ON THE MARKET NOW THEY'RE CALLED PAINT PANS
PAINT PENS WORK REALLY WELL
WITH THIS VARIATION AB MINTY PIECE GIVING SEATS ONE I HAVE DRAWN IT AS A THONG UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO THE FRONT FOR AN EAR OR RETAINING BED DOWN SEIZES WITH THONGS THAT PAINT IF YOUR DENTURES WHY NOT EVERYBODY IS EVERY DIFFERENT OR FOR THE THROAT
BUT THE PAINT DRY AND THE GLUE DRY
IF YOU NEED TO DO A COUPLE OF COATS OF PAINT ON YOUR LIZARD YOU CAN DO THAT LET IT DRY COME BACK IN AND PAINTED OVER AGAIN
IF YOU PUT IN MY NEWSPAPER TO DRIVE WITH THIS KIND OF PAINT WITH THE ACRYLIC PAINT WHEN YOU LIFT THEM UP HE'S GOING TO HAVE PIECES THAT NEWSPAPER STEPS TO HIM AND IT'S IT'S ONLY GOING TO CREATE MORE OF A PROCESS FOR GOING BACK AND CLEANING UP THE PAINTING A PAINTING OVER
ANOTHER WAY AND IN MY MIND THIS WOULD BE JUST ABOUT EVERY ARTISTRY IS TO MOVE TO SOME PLACE LIKE YOUR YOUR PARROTS ITALY SOME EXOTIC OR LOCATION ANYWHERE LIKE THAT OPEN UP YOUR LITTLE ART GALLERY YOUR VERY OWN LITTLE ART GALLERY AND JUST PAINT
MAKE SURE SHAKE YOUR PAINTS IT AND I WILL TAKES SEPARATES A LOT IN A LITTLE BIT OUT AND IT'S OKAY WITH THIS TO ACTUALLY HAVE PAINT ON BOTH SIDES OF YOUR BRUSH
YOU WANT TO PAINT IT ON SO THAT YOUR SKIN IS COMPLETELY SMOOTHING CLEAR LIKE A WHITE PIECE OF PAPER BEFORE A PAINTER STARTS PAINTING
AN ARROW SPRAYER PUMPS THE PAINT THROUGH YOUR ORIFICE AND MAKES IT OUT INTO YOUR YOUR YOUR FIND SPRAY FINISH AND YOU HAVE YOUR ADJUSTMENT ON HERE TO ADJUST YOUR PRESSURE
THIS IS HOW YOU POUR UP PAINT TO GET READY TO PAINT THE EXTERIOR EAVES
AS YOU SEE HERE ON THE TABLE I'M GOING TO USE MY LASHING TO BIND TOGETHER COUPLE MY ARTIST TOOLS HERE IN A COUPLE PAINT BRUSHES A PENCIL TO MARKER
NOW IF IT'S A TEAM THAT'S NOT REALLY SHOOTING A LOT OF JUMP SHOTS AND THEY'RE NOT REALLY HITTING A LOT OF JUMP SHOTS AND THEY'RE REALLY PENETRATE IN THE PAINT YOU MIGHT WANT TO PACK IT IN A LITTLE BIT
THE OLDER ONES LIKE THIS THEY'RE PAINTED ON AND IT WILL SMEAR THE PAINT IN YOUR ORNAMENT WILL BE RUINED
AND YOU KNOW THAT THE FURTHER YOU PULL BACK AIRBRUSH THE MORE PAINT IS YOU'RE GOING TO GET OUT AND ONE THING THAT YOU WANT TO LET YOUR TRYING TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT'S LIKE THAT THEN YOU WANT TO MOVE AS FAST AS YOU CAN
IT'S GOT NICE NICE SURFACE HERE THAT SMOOTH WE DON'T HAVE CREASE IS THAT WE CAN PAINT ON AND
SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE YOUR YOUR PAINT BRUSH STAYS ON NICE POINTS
AND I ACTUALLY MORE PAINT
SO FAR WE'VE PUT PAINT ON A RAZOR BLADE I'M AND GLUE SO IT CAN BE DRAWING
SO MAKE SURE I REMEMBER ONCE AGAIN WHEN USING THESE PAINTS AND RAISING ACRYLIC PAINT I GIVE YOURSELF ABOUT AN HOUR PERCH
YOU KNOW SOMEBODY HAS GOT A FAVORITE COLOR YOU CAN COME BACK TO YOUR SAME PAINT YOU HAVE A FOR YOUR ACRYLIC PAINT YOU CAN PAINT THE TIPS OF THE EASE WHICH GIVES IT A REALLY COOL EFFECT
IN A AND YOU CAN EVEN DO THIS BEFORE IF YOU WANT TO PAINT DESIGNS ON YOUR SHELLS THAT IS ANOTHER GREAT IDEA TO JAIL
YOU CAN PAINT THE WHOLE SHELL AND JUST DO THE TIPS LIKE I'M DOING HERE
IF YOU'RE REALLY AND MONOCHROMATIC COLORS SO WE'VE GOT THE INK IN BLUE HERE YOU CAN EVEN PAINT YOUR SHELVES
IT'S PRETTY RUSTY IN ANY PAINT IS VANISH LONG AGO
I PREFER TO USE PREPARE PRE PRIME JUST CAUSE IT SAVES YOU STEP WHEN YOU'RE READY TO PAINT
THERE IS PROFESSIONAL PAINT BALL IS A DIFFERENT WAY CAUSE NOW TO HAVE FLAG
SO YOU GOT A SEVEN ON SEVEN YOU SHOOT EVERYBODY AND YOU GOT TO GRAB THEIR FLAG PUT ON THIS SIDE AND THEN THERE'S RECREATIONAL PAINT BALL WHICH IS JUST LIKE FAMILIES COMING OUT HERE SHOOTING EACH OTHER OF THE PLAY CAPTURE THE FLAG STUFF THAT BUT IT'S MOAN IT'S MAINLY IN THE NATION
YOU SEE OCCASIONALLY I PUT A COAT OF PAINT ON IT JUST TO KEEP IT FRESH
SO THE NEXT OPTION IS ON FOR PAPERS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IN A SPECIFIC COLOR THAT YOU'RE FLIPPING FOR MAGAZINES CAN FIND ARE LOOKING AT A PAPER STORE AND CAN'T FIND IS TO PAINT THE PAPER YOURSELF
NOT SWORD ABOUT THE THE TEXTURE UNDERNEATH OF THE MASKING TAPE AND THE WHITE BASE PAINT WHICH ALSO WHEN I'M KIND OF THICK BECAUSE THE TEXTURE IS KIND OF A KIND OF LIKE HAVING THE LITTLE BIT OF TEXTURE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PICTURE FRAME
NOW THAT THE COAT OF BASE PAINT THAT I'VE PUT ON HAS DRIED I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND COLOR THE PICTURE FRAME WITH MY YELLOW ACRYLIC PAINT
THIS WORKS FOR US TO CLOSE TO THE MIDDLE OF THE BALL IS DEAD BEFORE IT'S TROLLING BASE WILL USUALLY CLEANED UP AND ALSO THE TOTAL CLEAN UP THE IF YOUR CARD IT TO A SPRAY PAINT
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE SURE THAT YOUR PAINT STAYS GOOD STRETCH
JUST TAKE OFF THAT LITTLE BIT OF PAINT AND THEN WORK YOURSELF AROUND THAT RED
SPEND A LITTLE EXTRA TIME TO BE SURE YOU GET ALL THIS PAINT OUT OF THAT RIM BEFORE YOU SEE YOUR BACK UP THE SKIN
WHEN YOU DO THAT IS TO STOP THAT FLOW OF PAINT AND THEN EVEN IT UP
BUT IF I'M GOING TO SET IT UP AND CLEAN IT THEN I WANT TO ACTUALLY TAKE THIS AND WITH WARM SOAPY WATER PREFERABLY WITH THE YOU KNOW RING ALL OFF WATCH THIS AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE PORTS ALONG THE BARREL SURFACE ARE CLEAN AND CLEAR OF PAINT DEBRIS
THE OTHER THING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO ESPECIALLY SUCH AS WITH THIS BARREL WHERE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN PAINT A BALL IS BROKEN AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU BRING ALL THAT DEBRIS OUT
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS THEN BEGIN THE PAINT
SO YOU HAVE SOME INSIDE THE CAR PUSHING DOWN THE BRAKE PEDAL AND WANTS TO HAVE THE BRAKE PEDAL DOWN ALL THE WAY THEY'LL SAY DOWN AND YOU WILL LOOSEN THIS LEADERS OFF RIGHT HERE IN THIS DIRECTION AND LIQUID WILL COME OUT THAT IS GOING TO CATCH CAN FOR THAT TO BECAUSE IT IS IN LINE IS PAINT REALLY THAT OR WHEN YOU'RE DONE JUST WIPE IT ALL OFF AND ONCE YOU'VE HAD IT SO THAT NO MORE LOOK IS COMING OUT YOU TIGHTEN IT BACK UP AND YOU TELL THEM THAT BACK UP AND THEY PUSH IT DOWN AGAIN AND YOU REPEAT THAT WHEN YOU OPEN THIS AGAIN AND LEAVE IT OUT IN PERIODICALLY MAKE SURE YOU'RE CHECKING THE MASTER CYLINDER WHICH IS WILLIE AND OPEN IT FIRST AND WE USE A TURKEY BASTER FOR FOR TAKING OUT THE FLUID AND YOU KEEP DOING THIS STEP OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON THIS PARTICULAR WE'LL UNTIL YOU GET A NEW CLEAR FLUID COMING OUT AND THIS ONE IS DONE AND YOU WOULD MOVE THE NEXT ONE IN THE BACK AND THEN USE A FROM ONES
DON'T SWIRL IT AROUND AND WIPE OFF THE PAINT ON TO YOUR PAPER TOWEL
I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO APPLY SOME MORE PAINT THESE LITTLE SHELLS HERE
AND THIS ACRYLIC PAINT IS GREAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH ANY POROUS SURFACE LIKE SHELLS OR WOOD IS GOING TO SET THAT PAINT RIGHT UP SO I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS
SO GENERALLY ON THE FIRST FIRE YOU CONCENTRATE ON GETTING THE SHAPE OF YOUR PAINTING IN AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO HAVE ALL THE HIGHLIGHTS WHERE YOU WANT HIM AND BE LIGHTNESS THAT YOU WANT HIM BECAUSE YOU CANNOT GO BACK AND ADD PAINT ON TOP TO LIGHTEN LIKE YOU DO WITH OIL PAINT OR ACRYLIC PAINT
AND IF YOU CAN'T GET OUT AND NOW TO START OUR HOLE TO FILL UP JUST PUMP THAT BRUSH A LITTLE BIT IN AND OUT OF THAT WILL MOVE THAT PAINT UP INTO THE INTO THE BRUSH
WE'RE GOING TO USE A PAINT STIR STICK TO STIR THIS AS IT STARTS MELTING
IT ALSO HELPS WITH PAINT CONTROL AS WELL
KIND OF HELPS CREATE AN EASY A HELPS WITH PAINT CONTROL AND MAKES IT A VERY COMFORTABLE EXPERIENCE FOR THE PATIENT
NOW YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND FOR YOUR PAINT
YOU DON'T WANT EXCESS PAINT LAYING AROUND THE JOB SITE
IF THEY'RE NOT MADE FOR PAINT BALL YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO USE THEM
NOW WE CAN KNOCK OUT THE GREEN BACKGROUND IN PHOTO SHOP OR ANOTHER PROGRAM BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH THIS WHITE SPACES WE HAVE TO PAINT AROUND THE IMAGE SO THAT WE HAVE THIS BLEND INTO A SKIN TONE
FOR INSTANCE IF I WERE TO SELECT THE PAINT BRUSH AND THE EYEDROPPER TOOL I PROBABLY WANT TO TAKE A SKIN TONE SOMEWHERE IN THERE AND THEN ADD A NEW LAYER AND PERHAPS BEGIN PAINTING LIKE THIS
ALRIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO CARRY THIS FISH ON DOWN BUT THAT'S HOW YOU PAINT THE EXTERIOR FINISH IT ON THE EXTERIOR EAVES OF YOUR HOUSE
DEPENDING ON WHICH AGE OF KIDS AND HOW YOU WANT TO WORK THE PROJECT YOU CAN USE A PAINT BRUSH OR YOU CAN HAVE THEM SMEAR THE GLUE WITH THE FINGER
SINCE WE USED A COUPLE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAINT
BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE PREMISE IN EACH OF THOSE WILL HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GETTING ANYTHING THAT COMES IN THAT PAINT
NOW IF IT GETS PASS THESE THIS SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE THEN BACK HERE YOU'LL HAVE THE CENTER WHICH IS AGAIN THE CENTER IT WILL BE THE ONE THAT HOLDS THE PAINT DOWN AND IS IN THE MIDDLE ANYTHING THAT GETS PASS THAT A LOT OF DEFENSE IS HIS OR HER RESPONSIBILITY
AND I'M GOING TO NEED PAINT THEM IN A BRUSHES
WE'RE GOING TO PAINT ON THE FABRIC FOR OUR DIY PANTS
SO WE'RE GOING TO PAINT THAT UP TO HERE ALL THE WAY AROUND AND THEN BRING IT ON DOWN SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO START ON THESE OUTSIDE EDGES
NOW THIS MEANS WE'RE GOING TO PAINT IT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE DOOR STUCK
NOW WITH THE CHANCE JUST LIKE WITH THE DOOR WE ONLY WANT TO PAINT THE PART THIS FACING THE LIVING ROOM WHERE WE'RE WORKING
OKAY NOW WE'RE READY TO PAINT THE DOOR JAMS PAINT ALL THE DOORS AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO PAINT THE CHANCE
ONE OF MY GREATEST JOY IS TEACHING WATERCOLOR PAINTING AND I HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS AND I AM VERY PLEASE THAT THEY WERE IN ON AND ON TO PAINT IN THEIR OWN MANNER AND ENJOY THEIR LIVES
YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS PAINT REALLY GIVES A VERY THICK LAYER THAT WILL LET THE COLORS THAT YOU PUT ON TOP OF IT SHINE THROUGH
SO WE CAN SEE THIS PAINT REALLY COVERS UP WHAT'S UNDERNEATH
LEAVING OUT THE THE PAINT FROM THIS PROJECT IS KIND OF A A KIND OF A DOWNSIDE FOR FOR KIDS REALLY ENJOY PAINTING
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT YOU SELECT THE CAULKING THAT'S PAINT A BALL BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM HAVE SILICONE IN THEM AND THEY'RE NOT INTERVALS
OKAY SO NOW THAT WE HAVE ALL OF TOOLS IN PLACE WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER SOME OF THE MATERIALS WE'LL NEED INCLUDING PAINT FOR PAINTING A KITCHEN
