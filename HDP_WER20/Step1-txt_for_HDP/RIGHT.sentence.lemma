I DON'T WANT YOUR ALL RIGHT NOW AND SAND I TRIED MAKING IT AND IT BROKE BUT ON THIS IS THE FIRST SCRATCH
THE LEG SO I'M GOING TO DO RIGHT NOW IS JUST FOCUS ON YOUR LEGS AND THEN WE'LL ADD YOUR ARMS
AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU RIGHT NOW IS HOW TO PUT A SPECIAL MESSAGE INSIDE THE PAPER
THIS TOP WINE IS A QUARTER NOTES RIGHT HERE
JUST IT'S RIGHT IN THERE
AND IT'S MORE OF A QUALITY RATHER THAN RIGHT
YOU'RE NOT SCREWING YOUR EYES ALL DAY LIKE ME THAT I HAVE MY GOGGLES ARE NOW AND YOU DON'T WANT TO GET A MEDIUM LENS WHICH IS PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE AMBER OR ROWS THAT'S LIKE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE THERE FOR THOSE SUNNY DAY IS OR YOU JUST WANT TO SUN THE STATIC EYES A LITTLE BIT OF NEXT I GOT SOME WAX HERE
AS YOU CAN SEE IT REALLY MELTS BAGS RIGHT RATE
GOING TO GRAB UP TIGHT AND I'M JUST GOING TO LIGHTLY DO IT RIGHT HERE
THE CONTROL ARMS ARE A RIGHT LEFT THEY ARE NOT THE IDENTICAL
THEY'RE NOT ASYMMETRICAL AS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT HERE NEXT TO THE BALL JOINT GREASE BOOT THERE IS AN L
HOW YOU DETERMINE WHICH SIDE OF THE VEHICLE IS IS YOU PICTURE SO SITTING BEHIND THE STEERING WHEEL YOUR LEFT HAND IS GOING TO INDICATE THE LEFT SIDE AND YOUR RIGHT HAND IS GOING TO INDICATE THE RIGHT SIDE
NOW THERE IS A PRODUCT YOU CAN BUY THAT ACTUALLY FITS RIGHT INTO THE TOILET HERE THAT HAS A STARTS OUT WITH NO HOLE AND IT GETS A BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER HOLE
THESE TWO TABS RIGHT HERE
ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS AND SPIDERMAN ONE OF THE MOST NERVE RACKING IS ALWAYS DRAWING IN THE EYES RIGHT
THAT'S A FACTOR RIGHT NOW
SO AFTER YOU'VE COMPILED THE FOOTAGE AND YOU START TO MAKE A ROUGH CUT OF THE DOCUMENTARY THIS COULD BE WHEN YOU GO IN RIGHT THIS PORTION NARRATION THE STUFF THAT'S POST A COMPANY THAT FOR THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE
SO A SORT OF AND CAUSE KNOWING THAT WE CUT THAT YOU HAVE DOWN ALREADY RIGHT OUT BASICALLY WHAT WE WILL BE SEEING THAT SECTION THE MOVIE AND A RIGHT UP THE CORRESPONDING NARRATION
THERE'S SOME PEOPLE YOU CANNOT CONVENIENCE THE NINE GLARES THE RIGHT THING TO DO NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO
THERE'S A HALF STEP BETWEEN A B C SO TO GET THE C E AND JUST SET YOUR THIRD FINGER DOWN RIGHT NEXT TO THE SECOND FINGER AND THEN TO GET EVEN WHEN YOU WANT THE FIRST FINGER AND D AND JUST LIKE IN THE F AND A THIRD AND KIND OF WANT TO THINK OF YOUR C IS TUNING IT UP TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S IN TUNE WITH THE IN YOUR EASY YOU CAN ALSO TUNE WITH ALL THOSE
NOW I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND DO A ROUND HOUSE TO THE SIDE RIGHT HERE BAM
SO YOU WANT TO GET ONE OF THESE AND AIM FOR THE CENTER RIGHT HERE AREA
SO SAME THING AS THE FIRST ONE THAT I USE YOUR HIP IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE A TORQUE WHIP IT ALMOST LIKE A WHIP RIGHT INTO THERE
AGAIN ONE THING YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO IS YOU DO NOT WANT TO HIT THE HIP BACK OUT AS FOR SURE YOU KNOW YOUR FOOT IS FROM IN THE HIP BONE RIGHT THERE
WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS TO TAKE THE RECTANGULAR MARQUIS TOOL AND JUST GRAB IT A SMALL PORTION OF THE PICTURE JUST BY GOING CREATING THE MARK G AND THEN GOING EDIT COPY AND THEN YOU CAN CLOSE THAT IMAGE IN PASTED EDIT PASTE RIGHT INTO OUR BACKGROUND PICTURE
SO HERE WE CAN IT COME OFF THIS WAY WITH NO ENGLISH THIS WAY WITH THE RIGHT HAND ENGLISH AND THIS WAY WITH THE LEFT HAND ENGLISH
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ALL THE WAY TO THE GROUND AND YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL THAT THE TIGHTNESS IN THAT STRETCH RIGHT IN HERE IN YOUR INNER THIGHS
I CHOPPED UP SOME PARSLEY HERE ABOUT TWO TABLESPOONS OF FRESH PARSLEY IT'S GOING TO GO RIGHT IN THERE
THE RIGHT HAND NUMBER IS THE CREATURES TOUGHNESS
SO YOU PUSH UP YOUR LEFT FOOT ONTO YOUR RIGHT YOU THROW
AND THE RECOIL ON YOUR LEFT LEG AND PUT YOUR RIGHT THROUGH
IT'S A COMBINATION TIMING THAT PUTS YOU RIGHT THROUGH
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS RIGHT OUT HERE ON THIS IS AN EDGE SO I'M GOING TO CREATE A LITTLE KNOB IN RIGHT THERE I'M GOING TO FILL IT UP
THEN I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER AND I'M GOING TO PUT MY FINGERS RIGHT ON THIS EDGE
AND THEN WHEN I COME DOWN AND STRIKE IS GOING TO STRIKE RIGHT THERE AND AT THE SAME TIME I'M GOING TO BE PULLING WITH MY FINGERS
THAT'S HOW ON BEING TAKES RIGHT NOW
NOW TO INHALE SIT RIGHT UP TALL BRING THOSE KNEES RIGHT IN TOWARDS YOU
AND I'M GOING TO SAVE THIS AS A GIFT FILE RIGHT NOW
AND SO IF YOU SEE RIGHT HERE AND PHOTO SHOP I'VE CREATED THIS YELLOW POLKA DOT IN A WHITE BACKGROUND IS FABULOUS AND I'M GOING TO GO UP HERE AND GO TO FILE AND BOTH PHOTO SHOP AN ILLUSTRATOR I HAVE THIS GREAT LITTLE FEATURE CALLED SAFER WEB AND THAT WILL AUTOMATICALLY KIND OF JUST MOST OF THE OPTIONS
PEG THE KANJI FILES ARE A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED AND YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY LET'S DO SOME COATING TOGETHER IT BUT THE GIFT IS WHAT WE NEED FOR RIGHT NOW
SO YOUR RIGHT LEG WAS IN THE FRONT NOW MY LEFT LEG IN FRONT
SO TOE ON THE FLOOR YOU'RE GOING TO JUMP OVER YOUR RIGHT FOOT OKAY AND LAND IN FRONT OF IT
SO WITH OUR RIGHT FOOT OVER I WANT YOU TO JUMP OVER THE TOP
AND THE OTHER THING THAT WILL HELP YOU DO IS ON THIS PIECE IS GOING ACROSS I'M GOING TO HAVE THE BAMBOO GOING DOWN INTO IT SO AGAIN USING A KNIFE EXACTO KNIFE CUTTING RIGHT INTO THE HOLE THAT CUTTING A LITTLE X INTO THE LEAF ON BOTH SIDES TO IT SO THAT WHEN YOU PUSH THIS DOWN THROUGH THIS THE HOLE
BUT WHAT THIS IS DOING YOUR SPREADING YOUR TOES GETTING THOSE MUSCLES TO START BEING ACTIVATED AGAIN BECAUSE THEY LOSE THEIR THEIR ABILITY TO MOVE WE CREMA INTO SHOES AND FLUSHING ALL THAT STAGNANT BLOOD OUT OF THE TOES THIS PUSHES IT RIGHT BACK UP INTO YOUR LEGS
SO A DRAW OUT ONCE AGAIN IS TAKING THE BALL FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
RIGHT IN THIS IN THIS SCENE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FOUR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF HERBS
I CAN DO THAT WITH A STRAP BUT I CAN ALSO DO THAT RIGHT HERE JUST TAKING THE HIP AND CREATING LENGTH
SO IF WE'RE GOING TO BE MAKING A LEFT TELL TURN GOING TO BE APPLYING PRESSURE TO THE RIGHT BOOT
OKAY WHAT THAT'S GOING TO DO IS GOING TO CREATE AGITATION ON THE WATER LEVEL TALKING FROM GETTING A FILM IT'S GOING TO KEEP YOUR YOUR YOUR CLEAN WATER FROM NOT ENTERING RIGHT BACK INTO YOUR YOUR FLUVAL
IF YOU'LL NOTICE YOU CAN SEE THE SKI THE STRAPS TO WHERE I WENT AND IT'S A SMOOTH WINE RIGHT THERE NOT SWITCH YOU MY BODY AROUND IS GOING TO BE A LOT FASTER AND A LOT MORE EFFECTIVE WAY TO SKI
I CONTROL THE LEVEL THAT IT'S BUST OUT WITH WITH HIS DIAL RIGHT HERE
SEE YOUR LOW LIKE RIGHT NOW I'M GOING AWAY FROM THE IN THE METERS OR GET AND GO ON UP
SO IF I'M GOING THIS WAY AND THE NUMBER OF METERS IS GOING DOWN THE NORM GO ON THE RIGHT WAY
AT THAT IT'S PRETTY CLEVER RIGHT
YOU DON'T WANT TO HOLD IT RIGHT HERE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
THE CUTICLE PUSHER I HAVE THREE TYPES RIGHT HERE NAIL CLIPPERS CUTICLE CLIPPERS YOU'LL ALSO NEED YOUR POLISHES THE SHAPE THAT YOU DESIRE YOUR BASE COAT AND TOP COAT
SO ONCE WE'VE SET OURSELVES WE'RE GOING TO RAISE OUR RIGHT HAND OR LEFT HAND WHICH EVER IS GOING TO BE YOUR FIRST HIT THE FLOOR YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE IT LANDS ON THE TAPE ONE HAND TO HAND FOOT FOOT
AND WHERE THE EYEBROW FINISHES AT THE HIGH POINT WHICH IS RIGHT HERE YOU WANT PROBABLY THE SMALLEST AMOUNT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PUT ON
THEY SAY TO MEASURE FROM THE TIP OF YOUR NOSE TO RIGHT THERE
AND YOU USUALLY FINISH RIGHT THERE WHERE THE HAIRLINE FINISHES AT ABOUT AN ANGLE
FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS PICK THE RIGHT TYPE OF CLEANS OR TO GO TO THE RIGHT TYPE OF SO ROUND
SQUAT JUMP TURN THROWING YOUR HIPS LOOKING OVER SO NOW BOTH LEGS AND THE TUCKED IN YOU'RE GOING TO TUCK THEM TIGHT RIGHT HERE AND FOR LOOK LEARNING ALL ABOUT HERE
THE HAND START OUT TO THE RIGHT MY MY LOWER HANNAH MY LEFT HAND WILL BE DOWN BY MY CENTER MY RIGHT HAND WILL BE EXTENDED NOT LOCK THAT HAS A NICE PER GENTLE CURVE TO IT
THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT I LEARNED WAS HOW TO RESEARCH INFORMATION BECAUSE THERE'S REALLY NO RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWERS WHEN THEY'RE COMES WHEN THERE'S GARDENING QUESTIONS
RIGHT TOES BACK BY THE LEFT HEEL TO FEET ARE TOGETHER ALMOST TOGETHER
SO WE'RE GOING TO OUR LEFT FOOT IN FRONT OF OUR RIGHT
NOW FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT YOU KNOW STEADY AND HAVE FEAR OF JUST LOSING ALL THE HAIR YOU CAN CLIP IT RIGHT BY THE EAR RIGHT HERE
SO WITH YOUR FRET HAND AND FOR US LEFTIES BEING OUR RIGHT HAND IS ESSENTIALLY WANT TO HOLD THE NECK YOU WHEN YOUR HANDS JUST KIND OF COMFORTABLY LAYING ACROSS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WITH THE ARCH OVER THE FRET BOARD
SO I'M GOING TO PLACE THIS RIGHT HERE ON THE UPPER LEFT CORNER OF THE SHIRT ISLANDS THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE THE WORD REDISTRIBUTE
YOU CAN EITHER USE A PAPER CUTTER OR I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS SQUARE BY FOLDING IT DIAGONALLY RIGHT TO THE POINT OVER ON THIS SIDE AND MATCH THE EDGES EXACTLY TO HERE AND THEN JUST FOLD THAT RIGHT IN HALF
THIS PROBABLY WILL TAKE OVER NIGHT TO DRY DEPENDING ON HEAVY THAT HAVE HEADING MATERIAL IS BUT THIS WILL MAKE A YOU KNOW YOU'RE CLOSE LOOK GREAT FOR A LONG TIME THE COLORS SMALL FEET AS MUCH FROM DRYING AND EVEN IF THEY'RE COTTON OR SILK IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER RIGHT OUT OF THE WASHER YOU CAN JUST HANGING HERE ARE HANG THE MINUTE DOORWAY AND THIS GOES FOR BOTH LIGHTS AND DARK DELICATE CLOTHES
THE OPTION THAT I LIKE TO CHOOSE IS TANGY RIGHT ON
SO ONCE YOU'VE TAKEN THE TIME TO THE RIGHT SETTINGS THE BRIGHT DETERGENT IN THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE OF WATER FOR YOUR DELICATE CLOSE ONCE THEY'RE OUT OF THE WASHER ONCE THE WASHER IS DONE YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND JUST TAKE THEM DIRECTLY OUT AND HANG THEM
AND YOU CAN INCREASE THE PASTE OF THIS SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST GOING TO GET A NICE RHYTHM
AND THE BEST PART IS IS WHEN YOU GET A HIGHLY FACEBOOK AND ALL OF THE QUESTIONS RIGHT
SHE'S GOING TO LIFT THE WAY UP ON HER TOES AND BRING HER WEIGHT FORWARD CROWN OF THE HEAD FORWARD AND THEN BRING THIS STRAP RIGHT UNDERNEATH AND IT RIGHT ALONG THE BRA LINE
SHE'S GOING TO COME FORWARD AND PLACE YOUR HANDS DOWN RIGHT UNDER HER SHOULDERS
SO WE'VE ALREADY MADE THIS FOR FACE SO SHE'S GOING TO COME AND PUT THIS ON RIGHT ABOVE HER ELBOWS
SO YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE THE STRAP INTO A LITTLE CIRCLE THAT'S JUST FITS RIGHT ABOVE YOUR ELBOWS
BUT DON'T TELL THEM RIGHT AWAY
THEY SHOULD JUST OR WEIGHT ON OUR LEFT FOOT RIGHT FOOT FORWARD
I WANT TO GIVE YOU A QUICK REVIEW OF IT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY GOOD SHUFFLE TO USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE STRIPPER DECK
SO NOW YOU CAN PICK UP THE RIGHT FOOT
AS YOU GET READY TO STEP TOWARDS THE RIGHT BOTH HANDS ARE GOING TO FLIP OVER IN THIS STEP AGAIN HEEL TOE SHIFT THE WEIGHT FORWARD ALL THE WAY ON THE RIGHT LEG
THE TWIST MOVE CAN WORK AS A COUNTER FOR YOUR OTHER PET YOUR PADS OF YOU GET A LITTLE BIT QUICKER WITH THIS RIGHT SO SHE THROWS SO GO LEAD UP WITH SO TO RELIEVE HOOK FOR ME
NOW SHE'S GOING TO ROLL THE BODY BACK WILL LOAD I'M GOING TO STEP BACK IN THIS RIGHT HAND TURNS DOWN THE HOOK UPPER CUT
WE HAVE ALSO THE LATEX GLOVES RIGHT HERE
WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE FULL SPIN WITH OUR RIGHT STICK LIKE THIS AT THE END OF IT IS GOING TO TAKE OUR LEG OVER THE TOP AND THROW UP IN THE MIDDLE
THE TIMING WILL TAKE A LITTLE BIT TO GET USED TO IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO KICK YOUR LEGS OVER RIGHT UP THAT'S A FAILURE
SO LET'S WITH THE DISPLAY FOR YOU RIGHT NOW PLAYING THAT STRUM OVER A BASIC BE SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY KIND OF BIG PLAY BUSY ON THE GUITAR STRUM WISE AND YOUR PLAYING OVER BASIC BE SO IT'LL SOUND LIKE THIS WITH THE DRUM TRACK IT
BACK IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE TAKE YOUR RIGHT HAND PLACE IT IN FRONT OF YOUR NECK AND LIFT IT BACK UP
BEGINS UNCOMFORTABLE I CAN TAKE THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT HAND AND LIFT THE HOOP UP
NOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WHEN YOU WILL HAVE I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT AND THEN PULL IT OFF TO THE LEFT RIGHT

YOU'LL NOTE THAT BUT ON EACH OF THESE RIGHT REELS SOMEWHERE I'VE MADE A NOTATION OF WHAT THE BACKING IS THREE HUNDRED YARDS OR FORTY POUND TEST THAT'S THREE FOOTBALL FIELDS AND A TRIANGLE TAPER EIGHT WEIGHT INTERMEDIATE
NOW LIKE I JUST THAT THERE ARE SO MANY CHOICES IN SO MANY OPTIONS THESE DAYS FOR BY YOUR MASSAGE TABLE BUT THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT ONES ARE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR TABLE IS THE RIGHT SIZE AND TWENTY INCHES IN WITH TO THIRTY TWO INCHES ARE THE RECOMMENDED WITH FOR MASSAGE TABLE
YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A RIGHT BOLSTER WHICH IS THE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT SUPPORT YOUR LOWER BACK
YOU KNOW YOU CAN ADD IT INTO YOUR FORMS OR INTO YOUR CAUSE OR ANYTHING THAT YOU MAKE UP IS A JUST TO TAKE THE BEST THAT SPIN AROUND AND TAKE ONE HAND OFF CATCH ON THE OTHER SIDE AND JUST CONTINUE TO FLIP THE LEFT OR RIGHT HAND WHICH EVER YOU START OUT WITH

NOW AS MELISSA INCREASES RIGHT HER ABILITY TO STRIKE OR SPEED AND POWER RIGHT WHAT I'LL DO IS THE HAND COMES DOWN A LITTLE BIT HARDER NEXT ONE IS A MEET THE HAND OKAY MEETING THE GLASS
SHE'S GOING TO BRING IT IN A RIGHT LEFT AND GO ON INTO

ALRIGHT GOOD WELL I AM SURE YOU'LL BE REALLY HAPPY WITH IT AND A IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH DOING IT YOURSELF OF BRINGING ON DOWN TO THE RIGHT FACTORY OR SITTING WILL GET OR HOOKED UP FOR YOU ALREADY SERVING CUE
AND THEN WHEN IT IS YOUR SPACING IS RIGHT
SAME THING HERE THIS IS A CHALLENGE RIGHT HERE BETWEEN THESE TWO LETTERS AS JUST NATURALLY A BIG SPACE SO SOMEHOW I'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TIGHTEN THAT UP AND I COULD
LIKE I SAID IF THAT THIS DRUM KIT UP SO MANY TIMES THAT AND WE'LL JUST THAT LATER IT'S NOT THE RIGHT HEIGHT
BUT THERE IS A FEW RIGHT WAYS TO DO IT TOO
SHOOT AND SNAP YOUR WRIST STRAIGHT OUT IN THE YOYO COMES RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HAND
YOU SHOULD LAY THEM OUT ON THE TABLE ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER AND MAKE SURE THE RIGHT OR AND GET THEM READY TO START MIXING AND MATCHING
WE ARE FILLING UP THESE MOLDS AND I WILL HAVE THIS TEN IN NO TIME SO AFTER THIS IS DONE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU GUYS WHAT TO DO WITH IT NEXT AND STILL IN OUR NEXT SEGMENT WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE I'M GOING TO STICK IT TO THE MOLDS TO A TO COOL DOWN
WITH THESE VANILLA CHOCOLATES RIGHT HERE I HAVE IS HEATING UP IT WAS ACTUALLY I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MY LITTLE DISASTER HERE IN THE BOTTLE
AND RIGHT HERE IN MY HAND I HAVE SOME FOOD COLORING IT'S THE GEL KIND OF FOOD COLORING
OKAY SO FIRST WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE OFF THERE'S A BOWL RIGHT HERE WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE LOOSEN THIS BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE OFF THE CLAMP ALL THE WAY CAUSE WE ARE GOING TO USE IT
SO WHEN YOU DO YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU LISTEN TO IMMEDIATELY AFTER JUST MAKE SURE THAT IT'S RIGHT AND SOUNDS WITH THAT YOU WANT IT
YOU ARE IN ACCOMPANY YOURSELF ON PIANO SOMEWHAT DOING CLASSICAL MUSIC WHERE YOU GOT TO PAY PLAY WHAT'S RIGHT ON THE PAGE
NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO NEXT IS I WANT TO TRY TO COPY SOME PATTERNS WANT TO DO IS I'M GOING TO GRAB MY MY CONTROL BUTTON AND HOLD ON PATROL AND COPY THIS PATTERN SO THIS PATTERN AND NOW IT'S JUST COPIED NOW INTO THE ON PLACE IT TO IT AND VIDEO WE'LL PART OR PUT IT IN PLACE IT OVER SOMETHING AND WE'LL GO TO MY D SHARP ACTUALLY WHAT I'M GOING TO GO TO MY F SHARP THE NEXT ONE UP AND PASTE IT RIGHT OVER
THE WOLVERINE JIG ARE THESE TWO SECTIONS THAT ARE MOUNTED RIGHT BENEATH THE TWO GRINDING WHEELS AND ON ONE SIDE WE HAVE A FLAT TOOL REST IT SLIDES IT OUT AND UNDER THIS ONE OF THE ARM SLIDES IN THEM OUT
AGAIN PLACING THE FINGERS WIDE HANDS TO THE FLOOR AND YOUR LEFT KNEE ON THE UPPER TRICEP BACK SIDE OF THE ARM OF THE RIGHT ARM
SO A FREE OF THE RIGHT LEG
RIGHT NOW YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO YOUR DONE A PROFESSIONAL FOR BRIGHT MOUTH
SO AS WE'VE STEPS BACK WITH OUR RIGHT LEG INTO A NICE DEEP LAUNCH FROM HERE IF WE WANT TO CHOOSE THE KNEELING OPTIONS WILL DROP TO THE KNEE IN ON CURL THE TOE
USUALLY YOU'RE KIND OF WHEN YOU GET DONE YOU'LL HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA FOR THE RIGHT BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET READY TO LOCK IT WILL LOCK
SO OF PART OF THE DIFFICULTY AND PULLING OFF ONE NOT JUST OF WAITING OF VERY QUICK MOVEMENT BY YOUR OPPONENT ON YOUR BLADE BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT FOR IT TO FOR THE BEATER AND I'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED RIGHT AWAY
SO MY OPPONENT IT TENDS TO BE MY BLADE AND I DISENGAGE BEFORE SHE MAKES CONTACT I'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND OF COURSE SINCE I HAVE MAINTAIN THAT RIGHT AWAY AND AVOID HER TEND TO TAKE IT FROM ME I WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT IMMEDIATELY WITH THE REST
SO IF YOUR OPPONENT TRIES TO BIND OR TO BEAT YOUR BLADE AND YOU SUCCESSFULLY AVOID CONTACT COMPLETELY WHILE MAINTAINING YOUR RIGHT OF WAY THEN YOU PULL OFF A SUCCESSFUL
I CAN ALSO DO SEVERAL IN A ROW AS LONG AS I MAINTAIN THAT RIGHT AWAY
THIS IS THE ONE THAT YOU SEE RIGHT HERE THAT I'LL BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO USE TODAY
NOW THE CHILD ONES ARE A LOT SMALLER THAN THIS ONE RIGHT HERE
BUT IF IT'S A BRIDGE LIKE THIS THERE'S JUST A HOLE RIGHT HERE FOR YOU TO FEED THE STRING
IT SAYS TO TACKY PUT IT ON THE RIGHT TIME
BOAT SO RIGHT
SO THAT INSTEAD OF PICKING WITH THE RIGHT HAND ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE JUST GRIPPING THE STRING WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND FINGER AND PULLING IT BACK ALLOWING THAT STRING TO WRING IT OUT
AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO GO ONE TWO THREE AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DO A CROWN SO WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT TO POP OUT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT AND CROWN RIGHT LEFT RIGHT CROWN
SO ONCE WE GET THIS BELT OUR WATER STAYS RIGHT WHERE WE WANT TO RIGHT HERE
INSIDE THE TURNOUT BLANKET NEXT TO THE HORSE'S SKIN WE HAVE ALIGNING IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE HORSE'S SKI
OKAY SO THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT YOU FACE IN THIS BUSINESS UNLESS YOU GET A GREAT JOB RIGHT OFF THE BAT IS IS JUST BE HAVING PATIENTS
IF THE BALL GOES OFF THE RIGHT SIDE YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACK THE RIGHT SIDE
SO WE'RE HERE ON FOUR WE STEP SIDE GO STRAIGHT UP OVER YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER SIX IS FROM THERE WE'RE GOING TO STEP WITH OUR RIGHT FOOT RIGHT CROSS IN FRONT RIGHT
MAKE SURE YOU BEND AND SNAP UNDER STRAIGHT UP TO THE SKY IS GOING TO BRING OUR RIGHT FOOT IN AND JUMP TOGETHER ALRIGHT
AND YOU LOOK TOWARDS THE RIGHT AS WELL AS YOU THROW YOUR HANDS DOWN ON EIGHT
RIGHT THERE THE MECHANICAL WELD HAS BEEN BROKEN AS YOU CAN SEE OUR UPPER BALL JOINT IS NOW FREE AND WE'RE READY TO CONTINUE WITH THE REST OF THE DISASSEMBLY PROCEDURE
THAT MY LEFT FOOT STEP STRAIGHT MY RIGHT FOOT COMES UP ONE TWO
MAKE SURE YOUR FEET ARE EVENLY SPACED AND YOUR BODY IS CENTERED RIGHT OVER YOUR FEET
WHY IS HOME SCHOOLING RIGHT FOR ME
BREAKS RIGHT OFF
WE'RE GOING TO JUST TAKE THE PUT THE HOOP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NEEDLE NOSE PLIERS AND IT WILL BEND RIGHT WHERE WE STARTED CUT
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WITH MY FEET AND THAT'S THE FULL FULL BREAST STROKE KICK RIGHT THERE
OKAY WE CAN WE CAN GET OUR TANK SET UP AND THEN A FREQUENTLY WHAT HAPPENS IS A SEEM TO BE DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU YOU WAKE UP AND YOU HAVE CLOUDY WATER
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES AND THAT'S WHAT THE MAIN REASONS I PLAY WITH CRYSTAL STICKS INSTEAD OF DOUBLE STICKS IS THAT I CAN EXECUTE THAT RIGHT THERE
I'D LIKE YOU HAVE A CHILDLIKE FROM THE TOP PROCESS THAT THIS IS FUN AND IF YOU FALL THAT YOU GET RIGHT BACK UP AND INTO THE POSE AGAIN
WE'RE GOING TO BLITZ UP THE MIDDLE OR YOU'RE GOING TO BOIL IT TO THE RIGHT OR YOU'RE GOING TO BLITZ FOR THE LEFT
SO YOU JUST POUR THAT RIGHT IN HERE SIZZLING HOT SO YOU GOT YOUR SHRIMP STOCK YOUR INTO YOUR BUBBLING POT
FOR AND SEE HOW THE BOAT ACCELERATES RIGHT AT THE VERY END FOR
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THESE GUYS HAVE A VERY DELICATE MEMBRANE ON RIGHT AROUND THE SKIN ON UNDERNEATH THEIR ARMS AND BE TRYING TO LEASH AROUND IT CAN CUT INTO THAT TISSUE
SO THIS ONE WILL GO FROM OUR RIGHT HAND SHAKE LIKE THIS
ANOTHER GOOD THING TO DO IS RIGHT WITH SOME WITH IT'S BETTER THAN YOU ARE GOING TO HELP YOU AND BY JUST BY WATCHING THEM RIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO DO SOME BETTER RIDING SKILLS YOURSELF
RIGHT ABOUT WHEN YOU ABOUT THESE DISTANCE YOU REUSE THE BALL SO THE BALL GOES
WHEN YOU THAT DOES YOU SHOW IF THE WEIGHT THROWING YOUR RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR BODY TO YOUR LEFT STEP LEFT SIDE OF THE BODY AND YOU SHOULD BRING YOUR ARM UP
SO I SLIDE UP BASE MY BODY KEEP MY BODY LEVEL HERE KEEP MY HANDS UP FOR THE RIGHT LEG LEAD SIDE KICK STEP FORWARD SHIFT REVERSE PUNCH TURN THE FOOT OUT
AS I LAND MY WEIGHT STILL COMES HERE I SHIFT FORWARD INTO THE PUNCH AND THEN AS I PLANT THE ARM BACK I THROW THE RIGHT LEG OUT

I WANT YOU TO PRACTICE WITH BOTH HANDS MEANING YOU START WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND AND THEN DO IT WITH YOUR LEFT FIRST

SO I'M JUST GOING TO PRESS THIS RIGHT IN AND YOU CAN SEE HOW PRETTY THAT IS
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IN CLOSE YOUR EYES IS I'M GOING TO USE THAT COLOR RIGHT ON HER LID AND I'M JUST GOING TO PRESS IT RIGHT IN AND I'M NOT SWIPING THE BRUSH BECAUSE ESPECIALLY WITH MORE OF A PIGMENTED COLOR IF YOU SWIPE IT YOUR SOMETIMES GOING TO GET THAT FALL DOWN DOWN HERE AND WE REALLY WANT TO AVOID THAT BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY WORKED ON HER EYE MAKEUP OR ON HER SKIN SKIS ME
SO BLENDER RIGHT INTO THE SKIN AND THEN IF YOU NEED TO GO BACK AND GET THE SAME BRUSH THAT YOU USE FOR YOUR CREASE COLOR YOU CAN DO THAT SO IT BLENDS EVERYTHING IN TOGETHER AND YOU CAN SEE HOW PRETTY THAT IS
A I WANT YOU TO BEND A LITTLE BIT OF A DON'T MAKE INCREASE RIGHT HERE MY BEND A LITTLE BIT SO I CAN GET THE ELBOW IT BACK IN THE UPPER ON IT AND I AM I DO THIS ONE AND A LITTLE BIT AS IF IF
THIS IS ONE THOUSAND PARTS ON THE TOTAL OF SEVEN THOUSAND PARTS JUST LIKE WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT ONE AT A FOUR IS ONE PART OF FOUR PARTS
WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE FULCRUM HOW THE FULCRUM WORKS MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT NUMBER FOR WHEN YOU WANT TO DIVE OFF THE BOARD
I'M GOING TO CRADLE MY RIGHT ELBOW TO MY BODY AND I'M GOING TO PULL THIS ARM BACK TOWARD MY SHOULDER
SO FROM THIS POSITION WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO USE THE WEDGE OF MY HAND AND I'M GOING TO HIT IT RIGHT INTO MELISSA'S WRIST BONE OKAY
RIGHT ON THE BEND OF IT
IT'S LIKE KIND STAND HIGHER FIFTY DEGREES AND IT'S GOT RIGHT AHEAD AND COOK BUT THE FOOD IS TO LEAVE WITH IT
WE'LL OR RIGHT OVER THE PIN BREAKER NEEDLE
SO WHEN WE LAY IT ALL DOWN YOU CAN I CAN SEE THAT I'M REALLY ON THE TIPS MY FINGERS NOT LETTING THEM TOUCH ANY OF THE STRINGS RIGHT NEXT TO THEM
TELL THEM THAT THE SEAM OR THE COVER ALWAYS GOES TO THE LEFT AND YOU CAN TEACH THEM THE LEFT AND RIGHT HANDS AT THE SAME TIME THAT SO THAT THEY DON'T TAKE THE BOOK AND START FROM THE BACK WHICH IS VERY NATURAL AND THEY WOULD EVEN PUT IT UPSIDE DOWN IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FACT THAT THE PICTURE WOULD BE UPSIDE DOWN
ON THE OUTSIDE OPPOSITE SIDE AS WELL THE WITH THE THAN THE ANY PART OF THE STICK RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE BALL IS GOING TO BE INSIDE AGAINST THE MILK CARTON SO YOU REALLY WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING THE STICK DIRTY WHILE YOU'RE PAINTING IT
FOLD ONE OF THE SECTIONS TO THE RIGHT SO WE STILL HAVE FOUR SECTIONS ON BOTH SIDES
WE'RE GOING TO GO RIGHT INTO THE POSE TO FROM HERE
THE TREES GRABS ME A FRONT CHOKE RIGHT HERE SHE'S EXPOSES YOURSELF
IN THIS CASE IT'S GOING TO BE RIGHT THERE SO I'M GOING TO TAKE MY PIN TOOL AND SIMPLY MARKET

AS THE SHOES RIGHT DOWN HERE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS SORT OF PUSH THEM DOWN AND MOVE YOUR FINGER ACROSS
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CONDITIONERS RINSED OUT REALLY WELL BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T RINSE THE CONDITIONER OUT WELL WELL ENOUGH THEN THE COLOR HAS NOTHING TO APPLY TO A WILL JUST SLIDE RIGHT OFF
WHAT YOU WANT I'M RIGHT HANDED SUMMER PLACE MY HAND BEHIND THE BALL SUCH INTO THE GROOVE
EXTENDING HER TAIL BONE RIGHT DOWN INTO THE EARTH AND THEN LENGTHENING UP THROUGH THE CROWN OF THE HEAD INHALING IN AND THEN AS SHE EXHALES SHE ROTATES INTO THAT LENGTH JUST A LITTLE BIT DEEPER
ALRIGHT SO THIS MISTING THIS MACHINE DOES HEAT UP THE WATER TO WRITE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DEGREES IN ITS AND IT'S A STABILIZING RIGHT THERE SO THAT IS GOOD AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE THE IT WHERE I WANT IT
AFTER I TURN IT ON THE WATER WILL START COMING OUT NOW STICK IT IN THIS HOLE RIGHT HERE AND WHATEVER TEMPERATURES STARTS TO STABILIZE THAT IS WHERE THE WATER IN THE MACHINE IS GOING TO BE AND I WANT THAT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DEGREES UP
THE WAY THAT I'LL TEST THAT RIGHT NOW IS BY TURNING ON THE GROUP HEAD AND LETTING WATER FLOW THROUGH HERE AND I TAKE MY THERMOMETER
LOOKS LIKE I SET MY SEAT RIGHT JUST BY GUESSING THERE BECAUSE I LIKE TO RUN A SEVENTY THREE AND A QUARTER OR OR SEVEN THREE POINT TO FIVE MILLIMETER SEAT HEIGHT AND THAT'S A THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT
THE BEST WAY TO MEASURE SEAT HEIGHT IS THE TAPE MEASURE MEASURING EIGHT CONSISTENTLY FROM THE CENTER OF THE BOTTOM BRACKET WHICH IS THAT BOLT RIGHT THERE TO THE CENTER OF THE SEAT TUBE
SO WHEN YOU COULD LEAVE IT WILL HOLD LIKE THIS WHICH CAN CUT IN HALF SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS FIND THE SPOT RIGHT HERE RIGHT BY THE RIB CAGE

SOMETIMES DEFENDERS ARE GOING TO CLOSE RIGHT OUT ON YOU AND ARE GOING TO HAVE A HANDLE THE BALL AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET A SHOT AWAY
THE SHOE SHOULD BE IN A NEUTRAL COLORS SIMILAR TO THE SANDALS I'M WEARING RIGHT NOW
WHILE FLIP FLOPS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE A STAPLE OF THE PREPPY WORD JOB THEY TEND TO BE NICE FLIP FLOPS ARE NICE VERSIONS OF FLATS LIKE THE SANDALS THAT I'M SHOWING YOU RIGHT HERE

WILL DEFINITELY TALK ABOUT THOSE RIGHT NOW
WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING WITH IT AS YOU'RE THROWING THE YOYO DOWN WHICH SEEMS REALLY WE'RE BECAUSE YOU'RE LIKE WELL IT'S JUST GOING TO COME RIGHT OFF THE STRING
AND IT WILL LAY ON THE FEATHER BOA LIKE THIS RIGHT ON TOP OF ONE OF OUR PIPE CLEANER HOLDERS

AND THESE GENERALLY COME WITH LITTLE WASHERS COME WITH THEM AND YOU JUST STIR THAT RIGHT ON THE BACK
WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE FIRST STRING ON WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE BALL AND THE STRING GOING TO PUT THAT RIGHT HERE AND THIS SLOT ON THE TAIL PIECE
NOW YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO FEEL RIGHT TO THE INNER THIGH OF THAT RIGHT LEG

YOU HAVE THAT RIGHT SO KNOW WHAT YOU'LL BE PAYING AT THE TABLE YOU DON'T WANT ANY ANY MYSTERIES OR ANY AN ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO GET A BALL ARC THAT YOU CAN'T GIVE AN EXACT EXACT FIGURE MAKING SURE GIVE YOUR BALLPARK FIGURE ESTIMATED SELLERS PRO SEATS ARE IMPORTANT
AND SO ONE RED IS THE CRUNCHED SIDE BID RIGHT CRUNCH SIDE BEEN LEFT THAT'S ONE RED
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS TO START OUT BY PUTTING THE LITTER BOX ON THE GROUND RIGHT NEXT TO THE TOILET
AND RIGHT NOW THE FACTORY DEFAULT IS EIGHTY %PERCENT
SO FAR SEASONINGS WE'RE GOING TO USE A LITTLE BLACK PEPPER SOME GARLIC POWDER SOME CREOLE SEASONINGS ONION POWDER SOME GARLIC SALT ARM THESE ITEMS RIGHT HERE WILL BASICALLY USE WITH THE CHICKEN ALONG WITH SOME FLOUR TO DREDGE THEM IN AS WELL AS A CUP OF OIL TO FRY THEM IN
YOU COULD PUT THE DECK RIGHT ON THE TABLE TELL THEM OKAY JUST CUT THE DECK AND WE'LL USE THE CARD THAT YOU CUT TWO AS OUR SELECTED CARD
RIGHT HERE I HAVE ONE EXAMPLE OF A HOME ESPRESSO GRINDER AND HOW IT WORKS IS YOU HAVE YOUR HOPPER HERE WHERE YOU THROW YOUR BEANS INTO
IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE DOSING CHAMBER I HAVE A LEVER TO PULL THE COFFEE OUT OF THE DOSING CHAMBER
AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE UP OVER HERE AS WELL I HAVE A STRETCH TO TURN ON THE ESPRESSO GRINDER
WE COULD HAVE IT COME RIGHT UP THE BACK BUT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE MORE DRAMATIC IF WE COME HAT HAVE IT COME RIGHT OFF THE TOP
AND YOU'VE GOT TO FIND THE RIGHT PLACE TO STICK IT IN
NOW DROPPING THE KNEE EXTEND THE LEG BEND THE KNEE IN AND OPEN UP THE HIP BY DROPPING IT OVER TO THE RIGHT BEAUTIFUL
BENDING THAT KNEE DROPPING IT OVER TO THE SIDE OVER TO THE RIGHT AND OPEN UP THAT HIP HER EFFECT

NOW ONE OF THE THINGS I JUST WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING JUST AND IN GENERAL LOG COLLECTING AND WE'RE TALKING RIGHT NOW SPECIFICALLY ABOUT COLLECTING THE GLASS
SO THE ONLY OTHER AREA THAT WE'RE GOING TO SPACKLE FOR NOW IS JUST GOING TO BE THIS AREA IN THE PLASTER RIGHT HERE THAT'S REALLY DETERIORATED A LOT FROM THE WATER DAMAGE
TRUST ME IT'S A LOT OF REPS OKAY THEN RIGHT AWAY AND BACK ON THE TRAIL BACKING THAT TWO MINUTES OF RUNNING

NOW WE'LL PICK UP THE PACE AND SEE IF OUR RIDER CAN ALSO THEN PUT THAT COORDINATED EFFORT HER SHORT RAIN RIGHT HAND ON THE RAIN LEFT HAND READY TO SNAG THAT FLAG AND BRING IT ON HOME WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SPEED
OUR RIDER IN TRAINING HAS STILL HER SNAP FLUTTER SPLIT REINS AS WE WOULD GO TO COMPETITION WOULD PROBABLY PUT A MORE PERFORMANCE BIT AND OUR BARREL RAINES ON TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN HOLD OUR REINS SNUGGLY WITH A SHORT WRITING WITH ONE HAND ON THE REINS HER RIGHT HAND SO SHE'S USING THE LEFT AND FOR THE FLAG RETRIEVAL
YOU MIGHT WANT TO FLIP THROUGH YOUR LOOK PHONEBOOK IN CONTACT YOUR LOCAL ONCE AGAIN OR YOUR LOCAL RIGHT ACROSS CENTER

AFTER YOU'VE OLLIED OVER THE BEGINNING OF THE LEDGE YOU WANT TO GO OVER THE TOP LAND ON TOP OF THE LEDGE PUTTING ALL THE PRESSURE RIGHT HERE AND HANGING YOUR NOSE JUST OVER THE TIP OF THE LEDGE ITSELF
AND IF THEY'RE POINT AREAS THAT PARTICULAR FILL TENDER THAT'S USUALLY A GOOD SIGN YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT LOCATION
I DON'T WANT TO SEE PEOPLE COME UP LIKE THIS AND TRY TO KARATE CHOP THEM RIGHT ON THE ON THE COLLARBONE
YOU'LL NOTICE ALSO HOW I'M GETTING OFF THE LINE OF THIS ATTACK RIGHT HERE
AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE A MAINTAINING A PROPER DIET MAINTAINING PROPER STRETCHING AND CALISTHENIC REGIMENTS MAKING SURE THEY'RE DOING THEIR WORKOUTS WHEN THEY'RE NOT ON THE FIELD MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE HITTING THE GYM RIGHT DOING THE RIGHT TYPES OF EXERCISES THAT THE RIGHT TIMES
NOW THIS BY ITSELF IS JUST RIGHT REALLY JUST A DOUBLE OVERHEAD ARE OVER
IF AS YOU CAN SEE WITH JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SANDING I'VE SANDED RIGHT THROUGH MY VENEER AND SHOWN THAT UGLY PLYWOOD UNDERNEATH
IF YOU HAVE A KITE OR UP PUMP RIGHT HERE SOMETIMES IT'LL COME WITH A PRESSURE GAUGE
YOUR OBJECT BALL STARTS RIGHT IN THE CENTER THE TABLE
BUT THE BACK STAYS IN THE FLOOR AND CONTROL IT INHALING AND EXHALING AND INHALING AND EXHALING RELEASE JUST LAY RIGHT DOWN
JUST LAY DOWN A SOFT MATTER COPPER AND BRING THAT RIGHT KNEE IN TOWARDS YOU AND PUT YOUR LEFT HAND RIGHT AROUND THAT RIGHT FOOT AND THEN LOOK UP TOWARDS YOUR FOOT AND BRING THAT LEFT KNEE IN AND TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN AND SWITCH PUT BOTH NEISLER TUCK RIGHT IN TOWARDS YOU WOULD LEFT KNEE AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO EXHALE SWITCH AND YOU'RE GOING TO INHALE AND EXHALE SWITCH AND INHALE LENGTHEN NOTES THE TOES GLOW LONG AND EXHALE

SO THIS RIGHT WORN IS HITTING THE WITH ITS HORN DRILL I'M IS A FORTY POINTS OF DAMAGE NOT JUST TWENTY
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS ONTO THE STEM AND THESE ARE CORN RIGHT HERE
SO I'LL PUT THE HIGH HAT THE RIGHT HAND HIGH HAT BACK AND IN THIS NEXT CLIP AND WE'LL GO THROUGH THIS THIS DOWNBEAT HI HAT LIFT ON ONE AND TWO
SO IF YOU PRETEND THAT THE PIANO IS RIGHT HERE AND LET'S SAY YOU HAVE YOU COME IN THIS RIGHT HERE ALONG WITH THE PAGE TURN
SO REALLY POSITION YOURSELF RIGHT AFTER YOU'VE TUNE AND FINDING A GOOD SPOT MAYBE RIGHT HERE SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF AN ANGLE
YOU'VE GOT TWENTY CARDS SO IT'LL BE ABSOLUTELY VERY MISERABLE TIME TRYING TO TRACK WHICH YOUR GARDEN I PREFER TO ALTERNATE THE SUITS CAUSE IT JUST MAKES RIGHT EASIER
AGAIN JUST PRACTICE SIMPLY BY HAVING YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR KNEES RESTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR HIPS AND PRESSING BACK LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO SIT IN THE CHAIR MAKING SURE YOUR WHERE KNEE BEHIND THE TOE IN LINE WITH THE ANKLE
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND A POINT WHERE YOU STOP AND THAT'S ACTIVE RANGE OF MOTION BOOM RIGHT THERE
HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS BECOMING THE BEST DEFENSIVE PLAYER YOU CAN INCLUDES BECOME A GOOD FUNDAMENTAL DEFENSIVE PLAYER IN A GOOD DEFENSIVE TEAM MATE AS WELL
AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE RIGHT NOW IS A SITUATION WHERE THIS GUY IS GUARDING THE MAN ON THE WING
THIS GUY RIGHT NOW HAS THE BALL SO HE HAS TO COMMIT TO HIM IS TO GUARD HIM FULLY BUT AS QUICKLY AS THE BALL MOVES FROM THERE GO AHEAD AND MOVE IT TO THE TOP OF THE KEY
RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE BAD STUFF
SO WE START WITH OUR LEFT HAND DOWN OUR RIGHT KNEE UP AND WE'RE BASICALLY GOING TO HAVE THAT NICE LITTLE STUTTER STEP NOW AS WE PIVOT OUR LEFT FOOT
IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH LIKE THAT THAT'S NOT COMING OUT THAT ONE IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE QUITE IT'S RIGHT
THAT ONE IS RIGHT
YOU WANT TO GO FROM THE HALF RIGHT FROM THE TAB AND IF YOU JUST GIVE A NICE LITTLE TOP DOWN LIKE THAT EVEN THE WEIGHT OF THING ITSELF SHOULD SHOULD BE ABLE TO PULL THEM OUT LIKE THAT AND RIGHT FROM THE THAT JUST LIKE THAT COME OUT REALLY USE
THAT FROM THE OUTSIDE RIGHT HERE BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE MOST GREEN
THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE WAY TO GO RIGHT IN THE IS TO PULL ON THESE LEAVES ON THE TOP
LOT OF PEOPLE TOUCH IT ALL OVER THE PLACE SQUEEZE IT YOU KNOW TALKED TO IT WHATEVER UM LISTEN TO IT NONE OF NOTHING LIKE THAT IS GOING TO TELL YOU IF IT'S RIGHT
HERE TOUCH THE HANDS THE WRIST GO DOWN IT FOR RIGHT INTO THE PAN
SO IN THIS CASE WHAT I'M AFTER IS A P THAT I WANT TO PUT RIGHT HERE SO THAT I END UP WITH PLACING AND SPACING
AND THE WHOLE IDEA OF TRACING HAS TO DO WITH FIGURING OUT WHERE THINGS ARE GOING TO GO DECIDING HOW TO PUT THEM THEY'RE PUTTING THEM IN THE RIGHT PLACE
RIGHT WITH THAT GRIP IS
SO AFTER I CUT THAT I MADE SURE I LEFT A LITTLE TABS AROUND THE PATTERN SO THAT WHEN I PUT THE IRON ON HERE I COULD THEN JUST SNAP IT RIGHT ON TO THE IRON
AND THE DIASTOLIC PRESSURE IS THE PRESSURE WITHIN THAT ARTERIAL SYSTEM JUST AFTER THE HEART RELAXES SO WE HAVE CONSTANT CONTRACTION RIGHT HERE IN THIS FAN TRICKLE SHOOTS PLUG UP THROUGH THE THE ORDER AND THEN IT RELAXES
AGAIN IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME BASIC FOOT MOVEMENT IN TERMS OF THE RHYTHM THAT YOUR FEET ARE MOVING IN WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE TO THE RIGHT THIS TIME AND WE'RE GOING TO BE PICKING UP OUR RIGHT FOOT AS SOON AS WE PUT IT DOWN ALMOST
HOLES THEM RIGHT OUT
I'VE GOT TO GET MEMORY CARD IT RIGHT NOW
RIGHT OVER HERE IS WHERE YOU CAN ATTACH POWER OR FROM THE WALL ARE FROM CIGARETTE LIGHTER AND RIGHT HERE IS WHERE YOU CONNECT IN A CABLE THAT WILL CONNECT THROW USB CONNECTION TO YOUR COMPUTER
THIS IS THE CAMERA STRAP IT ATTACHES SECURELY ON EITHER SIDE AND UNDERNEATH IS YOU SLAB THIS TO THE RIGHT OPEN THIS UP AND HERE'S WHERE YOUR RECHARGEABLE BATTERY DOOR IT TO PROPRIETARY BATTERY LITHIUM ION RECHARGEABLE YOU CAN'T USE AA THIS BATTERY AND HERE'S WHAT YOU PUT THE MEMORY CARD USES S THE MEMORY CARD
AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT THAT LINING RIGHT INSIDE
ONE THING ALSO ABOUT ADVANTAGE IS THAT WHEN THE REFEREE GIVES THAT YOU CAN ALSO STILL AND OUT OF OUR OWN SO EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY OF LATELY TAKING SOME ON OUR BASE TO MAINTAIN SESSION MY THEY DON'T COLOR RIGHT AWAY THE REFEREE THAT ARE
WE HAVE SAYINGS THAT EVEN THE RIGHT TO BIT IN THE WRONG HANDS CAN BE A PROBLEM TO THE HORSE
THAT'S THE OUT RIGHT NOW
AND KEEP HIM FROM EXTENDED CHILD'S POSE WE WANT TO COME UP AND BRING THAT RIGHT FOOT BACK BETWEEN HAND A LITTLE HARDER WHEN YOU'RE KNEELING PREFERENCE
NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE THE RIGHT LEG FORWARD OUTSIDE THE RIGHT ARM
SO RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO PUT IN AUSTIN TATIN PANEL
I CAN ALSO DO THINGS AS FAR AS MUTING THE LEFT SOIL IN THE LAST MUTING THE RIGHT AS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS RIGHT HERE AS WELL AS THE DINNING IN HIS HIM YOU ALL IN AMANO
I CAN TURN TO A FIVE ONE POINT A FIVE POINT ONCE AROUND SOUND AS WELL AS A LEFT CENTER RIGHT AND NOT SELBE TYPE MIXING SAME FOR FOR SPEAKERS
SO WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN BY TURNING YOUR RIGHT LEG OVER
YOU SHOULD SLIDE RIGHT ON TOP
ON THE FIRST THING WE DID IS BECAUSE WE HAVE THE BONE AND WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO JUST TAKE THE RIGHT
I PUT MY OVEN PRESETS THE THREE FIFTY YOU CAN SEE IT'S A THREE FIFTY AND A REAL SIMPLE IT'S JUST GOING TO BE CAREFUL WITH IT RIGHT ON TOP LET THEM SIT THERE TAKE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THIRTY MINUTES
SO MAKE SURE THAT YOU EAT A NORMAL MEAL SOMETHING THAT'S NOT TOO FULL AND NOT RIGHT BEFORE YOU WALK IN
IF YOU PUT THAT IN THE REFRIGERATOR IT'S A LITTLE BIT WARM HERE RIGHT NOW
IT IS SO WHAT I'M DOING THERE AGAIN IS JUST A SIMPLE FINGER STYLE PATTERN OR BASIC DRUM BEAT AND CAN SOUND VERY GOOD FOR A SONG TO MY RIGHT IN THE ROCK STYLE
IT'S JUST WATERCOLOR ON PAPER RIGHT
SHIFTING WEIGHT SIDE TO SIDE RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT
I DO IS I TAKE A SPIN IT AROUND YOUR ARMS ACROSS THAT I LAY IT UP AGAINST MY BODY TO THE SIDE AND THAT'S ACTUALLY STRIKE AND OF ITSELF BUT THEN YOU CAN TURN THAT INTO A SPIN BY TAKING IT ON FOR CROSSING YOUR ARMS CHANGING YOUR HANDS POSITIONS GUYS NOW YOUR RIGHT HAND IS PALM DOWN LEFT HAND PALM UP
ANOTHER WAY ADDING IN STRIKES INTO SPINNING YOUR BOW STAFF IS TO TAKE THE LEFT HAND A PALM DOWN RIGHT HAND PALM UP
YOU TAKE YOUR HANDS SAME POSITION RIGHT HAND PALM UP LEFT HAND PALM DOWN
YOU JUST HAVE TO LEARN TO CHANGE YOUR HANDS AT THE RIGHT TIME AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE STAYING IN THE CENTER OF THE BEST THAT SO THOSE ARE JUST TWO THREE WE BASIC WAYS TO BE ABLE TO SPIN YOUR BOW STUFF AROUND AND GET STARTED
THAT IS THE THAT'S THE MAIN THING RIGHT NOW
RIGHT NOW IS WE PUSH BACK IN NOTE WITHIN OUR BACKGROUND YOU CAN SEE HOW IT BUILDS UP

ALWAYS SHOW THEM THE NEW SPORTS CAR AND THIS IS RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF THEM AND THEY WOULD NEVER SEE ME AT ANY POINT DURING THAT STORY
WITH THE WEIGHTS ARE FREE WEIGHTS HANGING RIGHT NOW BY YOUR SIDE OR AN OPTION WOULD BE TO PLANT THEM ON THE MEATY PART OF THE SHOULDER RESTING LIGHTLY ON TOP
SOFTEN YOUR BRAIN SOFTEN YOUR EYEBROWS AND JUST A MATCHING THAT YOUR CHEEKS OR JUST SLIDING RIGHT OFF OF YOUR FACE AND YOUR MELTING INTO YOUR MAT
AND WE WANT TO BACK TACK RIGHT ON TOP
ON MY STUDIOS SMALL BUT IT'S A DECENT SIZE TO WHERE I'VE GOT A LOT OF LITTLE PLACES WHERE I CAN PUT THINGS BUT I KNOW WHERE EVERYTHING IS AND WHAT I NEED A PARTICULAR COLOR OR NEED A PARTICULAR ITEM I CAN GO RIGHT TO IT AND I CAN CONTINUE ON WITH MY PAINTING
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE POUR IT RIGHT IN LIKE THAT
GINA IS GOING TO TAKE A BIG INHALE IN AND THEN AS SHE EXHALES SHE'S GOING TO PRESS HER HANDS ARE RIGHT DOWN INTO THE EARTH AND LIFT WILLY UP GOOD
WILLY IS GOING TO COME FORWARD WITH THE PLANK POSE WITH HIS WRIST RIGHT NEXT TO GENUS HIPS THAT HAS TO BE ADJUSTED ACCORDING TO HELP TALL YOU ARE OF COURSE

AND THAT I'M RIGHT BACK IN THAT AREA
BUT IN USED IN A PERFORMANCE HORSE THIS IS GOING TO PUT ENOUGH PRESSURE TO THE ROOF OF THEIR MOUTH THAT WITH VERY LITTLE HAND MOVEMENT THIS BIT IS GOING TO PUT THEM RIGHT WHERE I NEED EM IN WITHOUT ANY HAND MOVEMENT ON MY PART
AS FAR AS FLIGHT PADS EVERYTHING IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL THE THREE BALL JUGGLING EXCEPT YOU HAVE THE ADDED COMPLEXITY OF THE CLUBS SPINNING AND YOU HAVE TO BE PAY ATTENTION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH THE RIGHT HAND
AND I ALSO USE TISSUES FOR CLEANING THINGS LIKE THIS AND THEN RIGHT HERE DIP IT IN WATER OR ALCOHOL AND I USE A TISSUE TO CLEAN IT OFF
SO THAT WHEN YOU POUR THE GROUT AND THEN POP IT OUT THE GLASS IS STILL ON THE SURFACE SO JUST BE EVEN NOW RIGHT NOW IT'S AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MALT SELF

I'M GOING TO DO IS TAKE AND SLIP RIGHT BACK IN HERE AND INSTALL OUR CAMBER BALL

YOU'RE GOING TO ALLOW YOUR LEFT KNEE TO SLIDE BEHIND YOUR RIGHT SHIN WITH YOUR HANDS TOUCH THE THOUGHT YOU'LL SQUAT DOWN HOLD STAND TWIST TO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION YOUR HANDS COME DOWN UP AND FORWARD
THERE WE GO SALES RIGHT FOOT PLANTS OUT
NOW THIS LEG HAS TWO OPTIONS IF YOU'RE STARTING TO DO THIS EXERCISE IS KEEP IT RIGHT HERE
WHAT I LIKE TO DO TO PRACTICE CATCH IS FIRST OF ALL TO CATCH WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND IN YOUR LEFT HAND IS TAKE THE FRISBEE CATCH IT LIKE THIS WITH YOUR LEFT HAND TOSS IT WITH YOUR LEFT HAND AND CATCH IT WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND

NOW ON THE FOREHAND SIDE YOU CAN GO ALL LAUGHED BIG AND RIGHT YOU CAN COVER A HUGE MANA CHORD IF YOU TAKE YOU THAT'S USUALLY DO THAT WHEN YOU'RE UNDER SOME TYPE OF PRESSURE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE THE STRONGEST POSITION SO YOU CAN SEE IF YOU'RE HERE YOU'RE IN KIND OF A RELATIVELY WE POSITION AND YOU CAN TURN IT AROUND IS A GOOD SHOT BUT TO GETTING TO THE CORNER MORE UPRIGHT POSITION IS BETTER
AND ON A FAST CLOTH LIKE THIS IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE HIT RIGHT IN THE CENTER AND SLIDE ALL THE WAY OVER THAT BALL AND STOP
IT WILL START WITH THE ANNOUNCER SAYING FLAGS UP AND A JUDGE SITTING RIGHT HERE AT THE FOLLOW LINE
SO YOU WANT TO PUSH DOWN WITH YOUR LEFT FINGER USING YOUR RIGHT FINGER AS SUPPORT

MAKING THEM RIGHT THERE
YOUR RIGHT HAND YOU MAKE THE BIRTHDAY CHILD THE HERO
WHAT KIND OF SEWING THIS THERE'S DIFFERENT PATTERNS RIGHT
YOU CAN GO RIGHT NOW I'M JUST GOING IN AND OUT
THIS LITTLE ONE RIGHT HERE IS THIRTEEN SO SHE IS DEFINITELY A GERIATRIC DOG
SO IT'S NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR RIGHT NOW
SO IF YOU NOTICE THE GREEN CLUB WHICH IS STACKED ON TOP OF MY HAND LIKE THIS THAT WILL GO RIGHT BACK TO MY RIGHT HAND
WITH THE OUTER LIP BACK HERE THE INNER LIP HERE AND THIS LITTLE AREA HERE AND THE DEEP AREA INSIDE WHICH IS RIGHT IN THERE
WORDS LIKE THIS RIGHT HERE FOR INSTANCE HAVE A LOT OF FLEX IT
THE ONE THAT IS USED TO OVAL AND YOU WANT TO PIN IT TO THE LEFT TO RIGHT
IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE TRACKS YOU BEGIN THE PANT ONE TO THE LEFT ONE TO THE RIGHT
SO RIGHT NOW I HAVE THE ANISE TENNIS IN THE MACKIE E FOR A IT'S A FOR TWENTY FOUR IS A CHART
OR YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S PRETTY GOOD AND THEN PUT THAT RIGHT INTO THE BLENDER AND THAT'S FOR A EGGS AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD A QUARTER CUP OF WATER FOR OUR QUARTER CUP OF OIL THE TRADITIONAL OIL TO USE WOULD BE SCHMALTZ SCHMULTS IS A RENDERED CHICKEN FAT IT'S NOT SO HEALTHY SO I LIKE TO USE A MIXTURE OF OLIVE OIL AND CANOLA OIL IT'S TWO TABLESPOONS OF OLIVE OIL AND TWO TABLESPOONS OF CANOLA OIL
NOW WHEN THE GLUE IS PARTIALLY DRIVING IS IT BEGINS TO DRY YOU CAN MOVE AND MANIPULATE THE BEADS A LITTLE BIT SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT WHEN IT'S WET AND YOU FIRST DO IT AND THEN GO BACK AROUND AFTER TO STRAIGHTEN OUT ANYTHING THAT MAY NOT BE STICKING IN THE RIGHT PLACE
IT GIVES YOU SOME FLEXIBILITY HOT IF YOU DECIDE TO GO TO FIFTEEN MINUTES WHETHER TEAMS HERE ON TIME OR NOT BUT USUALLY TO GETTING STARTED RIGHT WHEN THE A THE TIME OF THE GAME IS SCHEDULE THAT YOU LIKE TO END IT RIGHT IN THE TIME THAT IN THE SCHEDULE
IT'S A BAD SPOT TURN SOMEONE RIGHT AROUND INTO THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE GIVING HIM MOMENTUM TO STRIKE YOU WITH
SO YOU HAVE SOME INSIDE THE CAR PUSHING DOWN THE BRAKE PEDAL AND WANTS TO HAVE THE BRAKE PEDAL DOWN ALL THE WAY THEY'LL SAY DOWN AND YOU WILL LOOSEN THIS LEADERS OFF RIGHT HERE IN THIS DIRECTION AND LIQUID WILL COME OUT THAT IS GOING TO CATCH CAN FOR THAT TO BECAUSE IT IS IN LINE IS PAINT REALLY THAT OR WHEN YOU'RE DONE JUST WIPE IT ALL OFF AND ONCE YOU'VE HAD IT SO THAT NO MORE LOOK IS COMING OUT YOU TIGHTEN IT BACK UP AND YOU TELL THEM THAT BACK UP AND THEY PUSH IT DOWN AGAIN AND YOU REPEAT THAT WHEN YOU OPEN THIS AGAIN AND LEAVE IT OUT IN PERIODICALLY MAKE SURE YOU'RE CHECKING THE MASTER CYLINDER WHICH IS WILLIE AND OPEN IT FIRST AND WE USE A TURKEY BASTER FOR FOR TAKING OUT THE FLUID AND YOU KEEP DOING THIS STEP OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON THIS PARTICULAR WE'LL UNTIL YOU GET A NEW CLEAR FLUID COMING OUT AND THIS ONE IS DONE AND YOU WOULD MOVE THE NEXT ONE IN THE BACK AND THEN USE A FROM ONES
AND I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND HAVE THE STOP RIGHT HERE
AND WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND BRIGHT AROUND AND WILL MEET RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDDLE
THAT MEANS I'M GOING TO HAVE TO OPEN UP MY RIGHT LEG SO THAT IT'S NOT AGAINST DECIDE SAYING ON
HORSES MOVE AWAY FROM PRESSURE SO WHEN I SQUEEZE MY LEFT LEG IS GOING TO WANT TO MOVE TO THE RIGHT
THEN I'M GOING TO OPEN UP MY RIGHT RAIN SO HE HAS A PLACE IT GOES ALL YOU'VE ALREADY WANTED IT AND I'M GOING TO SQUEEZE WITH MY LEFT LEG
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SPECIFIC AREAS WHERE YOU CAN USE CHOPPING ON A HORSE AND AGAIN WHEN I SAY CHOPPING AND TALKING OF HOLDING YOUR HAND LIKE THIS USING THE SIDE OF YOUR HAND OKAY YOU CAN USE IT RIGHT IN BACK OF RIGHT IN THE WEATHER IS AREA NOT ALONG THE SPINE IN THE AREA THAT'S RIGHT HERE NEXT TO THE SPINE AND BACK TO THE SHOULDER BLADE
OR IF YOU DON'T WANT ANY COMMENTS BY IT JUST CLICK THAT AND THEN ON THE LEFT RIGHT NEXT TO THAT ON THE LAST IS POST AND CLICK POST AND THEN ILL CONFIRMABLE TIN
AFTER RIGHT YOU'RE PRETTY WARM AND SO ON THE RISK OF THE TREE FOR STRETCHING IS QUITE AS MUCH BUT IT'S ALWAYS STILL GOOD IDEA TO TAKE IT SLOW AND EASY
BECAUSE SINCE YOUR WRITING YOUR RIGHT HAND RIGHT ARM IN RIGHT SIDE IS GOING TO DO SO MUCH
YOUR LEFT SIDE YOUR WEAKER SIDE AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WEAKER IF YOUR ARE RIGHT HANDED TRY THROWING THE BALL LEFTY SEE HOW FAR IT GOES
IT'S GOING TO DO SO MUCH YOUR RIGHT SIDE
AROUND IN A CIRCLE NICE AND CONTROL KEEPING THE BALL RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU
THE FIRST ONE IS JUST A SIMPLE BALL TOUCH RIGHT ON THE TOP OF THE BOWL
RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT DRIBBLING AND ADVANCE DRIBBLING GET A LITTLE BIT MORE TECHNIQUE
ONE LAST THING YOU CAN TRY TO AFTER YOU'VE BEEN STUDYING SOMEONE SONG STRUCTURE IS TO TAKE A SONG THAT YOU'VE WRITTEN RIGHT OUT THE STRUCTURE THE SAME WAY THAT YOU DID THERE IS TAKE A LOOK AT IT IN AND SAY WHAT IF I TRY WHAT THEY DID AND SWITCH YOUR SONG AROUND A LITTLE BIT THAT WAY
FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WERE DOING A LANDSCAPE DRAWING WHICH WE'RE NOT TODAY YOU WANT TO BE OUTSIDE IN THE SAME GOES FOR NATURAL TYPE DRAWINGS IN THE FIELD IF YOU WILL WITH WILD ANIMALS OR MAYBE THE DOMESTIC CAT THAT JUST FROM THE RIGHT PERSPECTIVE KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A WILD TIGER
SO IT'S A GREAT WEAPON AND BECAUSE IT'S SO LOFTED THOUGH IT DOES TAKE A LOT OF PRACTICE TO GET IT TO WHERE YOU HAVE GOOD CONTROL WITH IT BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE COMING UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND YOU'RE LEARNING TO POP IT UP TO A GOOD TO THE RIGHT DISTANCE SO YOU GOT TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THE SIXTY DEGREE CLUB BUT IT'S A GREAT CLUB AND LET'S SEE HOW IT GOES HERE
TO GET THEM TO ACTUALLY CATCH IT IT'S REALLY THE SAME THING JUST A MATTER OF TIMING IT RIGHT LET'S TRY IT
TAKE THE FRISBEE WE'RE GOING TO USE IS ON THE GROUND RIGHT NOW JUST BECAUSE SHE GETS VERY EXCITED PIMA AND JUST FOR ME PICKING IT UP SHE WOULD START GETTING EXCITED
SO WHAT I'VE DONE HERE IS DOUBLE HOLE AND PLACE THE BUNCH OF LOOSE SAND IN IT AND I FILLED WITH THE BUCKET OF WATER OF THEM UP AND SATURATED THE SAND SO I HAVE GOOD WORKING SAND RIGHT NEXT TO THE SITE WHERE I'M BUILDING MY SAME HAND
SO I'M GOING TO STOP RIGHT THERE AND LET YOU TAKE IT IN THERE
SO WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW IS CALLED THE WHEEL WEDGE IT AND BRING IT UP AND BRING IT UP AND THEN COMING DOWN WITH IT IT'S GOING TO ELIMINATE ANY CONSISTENCIES THROUGHOUT THE CLAY BODY AND BRING IT DOWN THE BOTTOM HERE
SO HERE YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED THE CENTER AND THIS WHOLE WHILE THE CLAY AND BUT RIGHT MENTALLY IT'LL HELP YOU AND THROW IT IN THE BEGINNING AND A LOT BETTER IF THE WHOLE THING TO KIND OF CENTERED
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO DO IT ON THESE BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE PRESSING RIGHT INTO THAT
SO MANY TIMES PEOPLE SAY TO ME RIGHT NOW I'M JUST SO BUSY I DIDN'T GET MY WORK OUT AN ARM SO BUSY THAT I DIDN'T GET TO THE GROCERY STORE AND I COULDN'T BY ALL THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT I NEEDED FOR THE WEEK

THERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS WE CAN DO YOU CAN ALSO KEEP IT STRAIGHT IF YOU WANTED TO I LIKE THE CURVE AND PUT IT RIGHT OVER THE TOP
RIGHT NOW LET'S FOCUS ON THE RIGHT HAND
OK ALL THESE BASS LINES THAT WE'RE LEARNING COMING UP AND COUNTRY AND BLUE STYLE ARE GOING TO BE PLAYED IF IT'S A CUP OF USING THE FINGERS OF THE RIGHT HAND TO SOUND THE STRINGS
BUT THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT EFFECT THAT WE'RE NOT DOING RIGHT NOW

MAKE SURE THAT I GET IT RIGHT BALANCE OF APPLES AND RAISINS NOT TOO MUCH OF ONE OF THE OTHER
RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO SET THEM UP TO RYAN
WE'VE ALREADY TALKED A LOT ABOUT FLAT SETS SETTING THE DISC UP FLAT AND TIPPING IT UP FLAT RIGHT NOW WE'RE REALLY GOING TO TRY TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO SET IT UP WITH AN ANGLE
NOW AGAIN THAT ANGLES COMING RIGHT FOR ME IF THE ANGLE GOES THIS WAY OR THAT WAY IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT HARDER TO CATCH THAT
AGAIN THE ZERO BRING IT BACK ON RIGHT HERE TO LOOP STARTS BACK UP AGAIN
AND ON EVERY LOOP ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS PRESS THE A BUTTON IN WITH YOUR CALF SOCK OFF AND YOU'RE ABLE TO OPEN UP A WHOLE AUTOMATION SCREEN SET THAT LETS YOU CHANGE THE VOLUME AND RIGHT DIFFERENT CHANGES WITHIN YOUR SONG THAT AUTOMATICALLY ALM WORK AS A SONG PLAYS
SO YOU WANT TO GO RIGHT INTO THAT CREASE MAKE SURE IT'S REALLY BLENDED AND THAT'S GOING TO REALLY HELP SHAPE YOUR EYES AND MAKE THEM LOOK VERY OPEN

AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO USE AN INHALE TO EXTEND YOUR RIGHT LEG
OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO DIFFERENT SERVE WHICH IS THE WIDE SERVE SO MY GOAL IS TO HIT THE BALL SOMEWHERE I ABOVE MY RACK I'VE TO RIGHT HERE THE RED LINE THE REASON BEING IS WHEN THE BALL HITS IN THAT AREA BY THE OPPONENT DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF THE SHOT
THESE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE BALL OFF THE WALL OR YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET IT BEFORE BECAUSE THE WALL SO IF I HIT IT JUST RIGHT KEYS GET A VERY VERY WEAK SHOT SO
RIGHT LIKE THAT SO IF I DID BY KEEPING THE BALL BACK PART OF THE WALL THEY CAN'T ATTACK ME VERY MUCH I'LL USE THE BIG BALL
