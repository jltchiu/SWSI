HI MY NAME IS BRANDON SARKIS ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE HOLIDAY PUDDING OKAY SO NOW YOU SEE WE'VE GOT THE MIXTURE THAT LOOKS LIKE A LIKE THEM UP AND THAT ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO DO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR MOLASSES NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD ALL OF THAT IN THAT ONE AND THEN WITH THE FAT OR THAT THAT DOESN'T THAT TYPE OF FLOUR ON ALL READY BECAUSE ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE AND IF THIS WERE DIFFERENT INGREDIENT THAT ONE WAS DEFINITELY GET A DIFFERENT BATCH OF A LIST OF ALL THAT IN THERE IS THE YOU KNOW ALL ITS SPECIALIST TOUCHES EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE IN OR IN PRODUCT THAT REALLY MAKE THE THE OR IF YOU'RE GOING TO ROLL THE LEFT AS WE GO THAT IS ALL ABOUT THE LEFT WITH NO GOOD WITH THE BALL BACK UP AND SLOWLY STIR THAT IN AND OUT OF THIS KIND OF A GOOFY THAT IT IS GOING TO END UP LOOKING LIKE A KIND OF LIKE A REALLY DARK FAKE RUNNY LIKE PAIN CAKE BATTER ON FOR THREE STRAIGHT TEXTURE TO TURN A LITTLE BIT OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING LET THIS GO UNTIL THERE ARE NO WANT IT TO PROBABLY TAKE SEVERAL MINUTES SO I'LL COME BACK WITH THREE THAT POINT AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT TO THINK THAT IF YOU MISS YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT NO ONE SO THERE WE GO NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IS I WANT IT STRAIGHT DOWN TO REALLY SLOWLY AND THE MILK AND TALKING LIKE AND TRIPLE FOR AND WITH THIS IS DOING IS
I'M A DENTAL AND ONCE YOU HAVE THIS REALLY LOOSE THAT MIXTURE FOR THE BIG THICK CENTER IN IT AND I DO IT LIKE THIS FOR ADDING THE MILK AND IS ACTUALLY GETTING MIXED IN FOR AS YOU GET THE BOARD IN IT'S NOT JUST FOR THE I'LL START TO BE A LOT OF THE EARLIER HOW IT'S REALLY RUNNING AROUND THE EDGES IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR CAMERA SPEED UP TO DEAL WITH THAT FOR YOU FOR THAT YOU CAN MILK AND THEN FOR THEM ALL IN THERE AT THE END RIGHT THERE'S FOR ALL YOUR INGREDIENTS IT THERE FOR YOUR A YOUR FRUIT NOTHING THIS POINT WE'RE GOING TO GO IN ABSOLUTELY LAST THOUGH IS GIVE THIS A FUNGUS COUPLE MINUTES AT THE SPEED WITH STRIP THE SIDES DOWN WE COME BACK AND FOLD IF WE CAN THAT'S IN OUR PAN READY AND THROW IT IN THE OVEN
AS WE TAKE THE PARTS OFF WE WANT TO LAY AMOUNT FOR THE SAME THING FORMAT BECAUSE OF CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER THE OVERLAP OTHER PLASTIC PARKS AND WE KEEP THEM IN THAT ORDER OF THE REASSEMBLY FAVOR BE A LOT LESS CONFUSING A LOT LESS CHANCE WE END UP WITH SOME OVERLAPPING LABOR EITHER
FIRST AND YOU JUST TAKE A FEW LITTLE FRIENDS THAT AND YOU CAN LEAVE A LITTLE BIT HANGING OUT THE END BECAUSE YOU'LL EVENTUALLY CUT THOSE OFF ANYWAY
ANYTIME THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM LIKE YOU CAN SEE SOMETIMES IS THAT IF YOU'RE DOING OF REAL DETAILED SAY A FACE OR SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT THOSE LITTLE BLOBS TO END UP ON THERE THAT WOULD BE A HARD TO GET OFF OF THAT KIND OF DETAIL
AND THOSE PIECES THAT ARE MORE POPULAR AT THIS TIME PERIOD ARE GOING TO COST MORE MONEY SO THAT'S A CONSIDERATION WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT COLLECTING SOMETHING IN THE END
WE WERE DOING STORIES THAT HAD A BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END ON TWENTY TWO PAGES
SO THE WAY YOU CAN DO AT THIS POINT IS KIND OF FOLD THAN ANY PARTS ARE HANGING OUT OF THE END THAT YOU MAY WANT TO BRING BACK INTO YOUR BUBBLE WRAP ROLL
I FIND THE CENTER OF THE WING PUT IT DIRECTLY DOWN WE END OF THE BUGGY WORKING ALONG THE LEADING EDGE
WE WANT TO GET THE DETAIL SO WE END UP DOING THEM IN SCALE AS WELL
AND THE NINETY POUND ESPECIALLY NEEDS TO BE STRETCHED BECAUSE AFTER YOU'VE GOTTEN AT ALL WET IT WILL BE VERY WAVY AND YOU WON'T END UP WITH A SMOOTH SURFACE
SO MOST OF THEM ARE EQUIPPED WITH LIKE A BALL BEARING TYPE SWIVEL AT THE VERY END SO THAT MAKES A LITTLE BIT FASTER AND THE JUMP ROPE ITSELF DOESN'T GET BALLED UP INSIDE THE HANDLE
IT'S ON THIS AND THEN ON THE B STRING IT'S ON THIS END
YOU LEAVE IT AT THE START AND YOU'RE GOING TO END UP RIGHT BACK THERE AT THE END
OKAY AND WHAT THEY DO IS THEY DO THE SAME TYPES OF MOVEMENTS BUT DUE TO THE WEIGHT BEING A LITTLE BIT HEAVIER ON ONE END OKAY MAKES YOUR FLOWERS AND DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES A LOT FASTER AND THOSE ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STAFF
AND THEN WE'LL COME UP OR COMPILED THE VOCAL MEANING WE'RE GOING TO TAKE LIONS THE BEST LINES FOR EACH PASS THAT WE'VE SAVED AND PUT TOGETHER A REALLY SOLID VOCAL PERFORMANCE FROM BEGINNING TO END
AND THAT SOMETIMES HARD BECAUSE IT'S REAL EASY TO DROP OFF THE EDGE AND WE END UP WITH OUR HAND ON THE GRINDER
QUITE OFTEN IT'S BEST TO DO THIS IN THE EVENING TOWARD THE END OF YOUR DAY
AT THE END OF THE BRIDAL SHOWER THE PERSON WHO HAS THE MOST NECKLACES OR PINS WHATEVER YOU'RE USING IS GOING TO BE THE WINNER OF THAT GAME AND THEY'RE GOING TO GET A PRIZE
AFTER CHILD HAS BEEN MASTERING BLENDS FOR A WHILE MAYBE A COUPLE WEEKS MAYBE A LITTLE MORE WHATEVER YOU THINK IN THAT YOU'VE MADE SOME THEM SOME NICE BOOKS IN WORKSHEETS USING BLENDS AND AND BLENDS TO IN THE BEGINNING TO IN THE END WE'RE GOING TO START HAVING DOUBLE BLENDS AND TRIPLE BLENDS
NOW DOUBLE BLENDS ARE WHEN YOU HAVE A BLEND IN THE BEGINNING AND THE END TWO CONSONANTS TWO CONSONANTS AND JUST ONE VOWEL IN THE MIDDLE
HOWEVER FOR SMALLER TIGHTER BRAIDS YOU MAY WANT TO USE THE END OF A RAT TAIL COMB AND GET IT LOOSE UNTIL IT'S COMPLETELY AND BRAID
NEXT BEGIN AT THE END OUR BOTTOM OF THE PLANT AND BEGIN UNRAVELING
A LOT LIKE AND WITH THIS AND PUT IT ON THE VERY END
AND BE CAREFUL BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY SHARP ON THE END
SO YOU WANT TO TAKE THE END OF THE STRING
SO THE FIRST STEP IS JUST TO HIS TO STICK THE END OF THE STRING
NOW WHEN YOU START THAT WAY I START THAT IS I MAKE A LITTLE LOOP LIKE THIS FOR TWISTED AROUND ONE MORE TIME AND THEN TAKE THE END TO THE TOP OF THAT LOOP
TO WIDEN YOUR STANCE FIND THE CREAM MARKED FACTORY HOLES AND GO AS FAR AWAY FROM THEM AS YOU CAN TOWARDS EITHER END OF THE BOARD
IT MAY NOT ACTUALLY GO FLAT AND SO YOU GOT ON THE ROAD AND ACTUALLY HAS SOME SOME SERIOUS PRESSURE UNDER IT AND THEN YOU'LL END UP FIX ANOTHER FLAT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THAT'S NEVER GOOD
AND ONCE WE REMOVE THE MASK FROM HER BACK WE'RE GOING TO END THE TREATMENT NOW WITH A LITTLE SPRITZ I WOULD TONER AND THIS IS JUST REFRESHING FOR THE SKIN AND JUST TO ADD TO TIGHTEN UP THE PORES AND CLOSE EVERYTHING DOWN AND YOU JUST WANT TO GENTLY STROKE HER BACK AND JUST MAKE SURE THE PRODUCT IS NICE AND NEAT ABSORBED
NOW GO AHEAD AND PURCHASE YOUR TICKETS ON LINE AND THEN ONCE YOU MAKE YOUR PURCHASE YOU CAN PICK YOUR TICKETS UP AT THE END TRACK OF DEPARTURE POINT
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO ADD TOO MUCH WEIGHT OATMEAL OR YOU COULD END UP DRYING YOUR SKIN OUT
THAT'S BECAUSE I FORGOT TO CLOSE OUT MY FONT BRACKET AT THE END OF THIS PARAGRAPH
YOU JUST GO IN HERE AND YOU FIND FACE IT COOLS AND YOU KNOW LET'S DO A CAREER COMMA HELPS TRUCK EQUALS CAREER KARMA CURE YOUR NEW AND END THAT
ONE OF THOSE THINGS AS INSTRUCTORS LET IT SET TO YOU IS HAVE ABOUT THIRTY TO BE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW IT MIGHT BE THREE TO END UP BEING GREAT REALTORS
IF I DO TAKE OFF THE END TAGS ON THESE TWO PARAGRAPHS WILL JUSTIFY ALL THREE OF THESE PARAGRAPHS TOGETHER
I PREFER WHEN I START MY WEAVING I LIKE TO START IN THE MIDDLE BECAUSE THE STRIP IS SO LONG IT'LL BE A LITTLE BIT SHORTER IF WE START IN THE MIDDLE AND GO FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER END
BUT I'VE GOT THE OTHER END ON THE INSIDE NOW
ACTUALLY PUT ON THE END OF THE DISH ANOTHER CUP TO HOLD IT UP THE WALK
SO I LIKE TO SET THINGS UP SO I HAVE A NICE EVEN ANGLE DOWN MY HAND TO MY WRIST TO WRAP AROUND THE BRAKE LEVER ON I ALSO LIKE TO BE A PERSONALLY LIKE TO BE ABLE TO REACH THE BRAKE LEVER WITH MY HAND IS ON THE END OF THE HANDLEBAR LIKE THIS
AND YOU PUT A LITTLE MORE PAINT TOWARDS THE END OF YOUR BRISTLES
SO LET'S SAY WE'RE AND E FLAT AND HAVE FUN IS NOW IN THE END AND NOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT ARE ROW THAT SOUNDS GOOD THERE I WANT TO DO IT AND NEXT KEY
SO WHAT I DO IS I'LL TAKE IN THE CHOP OUT FROM ONE SECTION TO ANOTHER JOYS AND JUST REPLACE THAT WERE THE JOINT OF THE BOARDS MEAT IN THE END AND THEY KIND OF GET SPONGING RIGHT OUT
IT'S NOT STICKING WHICH IS NICE IS COMING ARE OUT THERE ON THE END
IF YOU'RE USING THE SKEW TO SMOOTH THE ITEM SMOOTH THE WORK DOWN MAKE V CUTS CUT BEADS SQUARE OFF THE END OF THE END OF THE STOCK
AND IN THIS CASE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A ROPE CLIPPED IN TO THE BACK HERE AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE DIVING OUT ATTACHED TO THE END OF THAT ROPE WITH SOMEONE STILL HOLDING THE END
IT'S MADE OUT OF METAL HONESTLY GREAT HAS A RING ON EACH END
IT'S EASY TO GET INTO THIS POSITION BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS BY ROLLING BACKWARDS WITH TOO MUCH SPEED AND YOU END UP BLOCKING OVER
SO THE BOTTOMS OF COOK A LITTLE BIT LONGER THE TOPS OF OVERHEAD AT THE END
SO THIS POINT I WANT YOU NICE WIRE TOOL IN THE END OF THAT AND MOVE IT OVER THE LEFT
THEY ALSO HAVE THEM WHERE THERE'S VELCRO AROUND THE END SO THAT YOU CAN PUT THEM ON THE WRIST OR UP ON THE ARM AS WELL
IT'S ALSO GOOD FOR GETTING PEOPLE PHYSICALLY WARMED UP BECAUSE THEY ARE REALLY GOING TO BE MOVING BY THE END OF THIS EXERCISE
AS YOU COME TO THE END OF A ROW OF ANY PROJECT WE'LL FINISH OUT OUR ROPE WITH WHATEVER STITCH WE'RE DOING
AND THAT'S A REALLY COMMON THING FOR PEOPLE TO DO A NICE TO DO THAT TOO BUT A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU DO THAT IT PUSHES THE LIP COLOR OUT AND YOU END UP HAVING TO APPLY IT MANY MORE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY SO TRY TO JUST GET USED TO PRESSING TOGETHER GOING PRESS AGAIN AND IT'S GOING TO HELP TO BLEND ALL THAT COLOR TOGETHER BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO MOVE YOUR GLOSS
I FIND RIGHT NEAR THE END OF THE FINGERBOARD IS COMFORTABLE
SO AGAIN LAST TWO YOU MUST HAVE THE DEUCES OR CARDS TO GET OFF LEAD TOWARD THE END OF THE HAND
IN OTHER WORDS YOU DON'T WANT TO END UP WITH LETTERS THAT LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE TYPE THAT YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST USE TYPE
BUT OVERALL IT'S VERY REWARDING BECAUSE YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT YOU'RE HELPING SOMEBODY OR EDUCATING SOMEBODY AND YOUR ENABLING SOMEBODY TO HAVE A NICE HEALTHY LIFE
I'M GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO GET TO THE OTHER END
SO IT'S ALL ABOUT WEIGHT SHIFTING JUST LIKE THE OTHER CARS BUT ON LIKE THE OTHER CARDS YOU CAN JUST A STAND ON THE END OF THE EYE AND THE CARL JUST KIND OF GLIDE THROUGH THE CORNERS
WHEN YOU GET TO THE END YOUR FINGERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ASPARAGUS SO IF YOU CAN'T GET TO THE LAST LITTLE ENDS WITHOUT PUTTING YOURSELF PLEASE DON'T
OKAY THE LEMON IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE AT THE END WHEN WE SURF THE SCHNITZEL
SO THE ORDER IN WHICH YOU HAVE THE PEDALS INFLUENCES THE SOUND THAT YOU GET BY THE TIME IT GETS THAT TO THE END
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP THAT SHIELD UP AS YOU'RE PULLING THE BALL BACK BECAUSE IF NOT YOU PULL THE BALL BACK YOU LEAVE YOURSELF OPENING EXPOSE THE DEFENDER ONLY HAS TO DO STEP THROUGH TAKE THAT BALL IS GOING TO GO DOWN ON THE OTHER END AND SCORE IT
AND IT LOOKS BETTER AT THE END WHEN YOU SEE THE FINISHED RESULT BECAUSE THIS IS NOT GOING TO LOOK LIKE A CAN BE QUITE WHEN WE'RE DONE
AND THEN I LIKE TO END WITH A NICE BLUE
YOU REALLY WANT TO GO AS FAST AS YOU CAN INTO THAT TUMBLE GET A LOT OF HOWEVER GOING AND REALLY SNAP OUT OF IT AND FROM HERE AT THE END OF OUR ROUNDS OFF IS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO DO ALL OF OUR BACK FLIPS BACK HANDSPRINGS IN FULLS
