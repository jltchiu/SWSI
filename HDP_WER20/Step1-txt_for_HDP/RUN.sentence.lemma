OUR QUARTERBACK PRETTY MUCH RUNS JUST LIKE YOU WOULD A NORMAL HAND OFF PLAY EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT ONCE THE HANDS THE BALL OFF OUR QUARTERBACK THEN ALSO HAS TO TURN AND RUN TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FIELD SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN GO DOWN FIELD AND BECOME A BLOCKER AS WELL

ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHARE MY THATS ON BEING MENTALLY PREPARED FOR RUN
BECAUSE WHAT WILL FLOWER USUALLY DOES NOT THIS OFF COMPLETELY SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT A RUN OF THE SCREEN THAT YOU NEED THE BATTER BOWL
SOMETIMES YOU CAN FIND A UNIQUE RUN ALL THE T CHESS SET THAT HAS STAMPED ON THE BOTTOM OF IT WHAT THAT PIECE IS IN WITH A LITTLE MARKER THAT LOOKS LIKE A STAUNTON PIECE OF IT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE WHEN YOU'RE SETTING THINGS UP
FOR EXAMPLE IF WE HAD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MELD WE HAVE A DOUBLE RUN A SUIT THAT'S A POWERFUL HAND NOW WE HAVE LOTS OF ROOM BECAUSE ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS MAKE OUR TWENTY MELD THAT'S THE BASIC REQUIREMENT WE SAVE OUR TWENTY MELD HUNDRED FIFTY POINTS IS GOING TO PICK UP AN AWFUL LOT OF OVER ROOM FOR ERROR IF WE FELT FALL SHORT ARE ENCOUNTERS THAT IS IF WE DON'T HAVE MORE THAN YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE A NORMAL COUNTERS THAT'S FINE
THIS IS CREATURE SPECIFIC FOR COLOR WHICH MEANS YOU WOULD PUT THIS IN YOUR SIDEBOARD TO YOUR MAIN DECK AND IF YOU RUN ACROSS SOMEONE WHO'S RUNNING HEAVY GREEN OR WHITE CREATURES THEN YOU WOULD PLACE THIS CARD IN THERE AND BASICALLY YOU'RE GETTING A FREE TEAR BECAUSE TEAR COSTS YOU ONE AND A BLACK AND THIS ONLY COST YOU A BLACK TO DESTROY TARGET GREEN OR A CREATURE
