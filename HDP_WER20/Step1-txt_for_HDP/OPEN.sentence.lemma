AND WITH YOUR FIRST THING YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN REALLY LEAVE THOSE OPEN AND THAT'S REALLY GOING TO COME FROM USING THE TIPS OF OUR FINGERS PLAYING RIGHT ON THE VERY OUR FINGERTIPS WHEN WE PLAY THAT
THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DO IS OPEN YOUR HOOD AND LOCATE THE BRAKE MASTER CYLINDER
SO YOU HAVE IS WHAT I MEAN BY OCTAVES OR OPEN E AND THEN OF COURSE THIS WOULD MAKE A THE FOURTEENTH FRET FOR YOUR THIRD FOURTH FINGER IS ON THE A AND D STRING
SO WHAT YOU'RE USING THERE IS A HARMONIZED CHORD PLATE OVER SIMPLE DRUM BEAT WITH THE OPEN STRING AND HAVING CREATING A NICE LITTLE PRETTY EITHER LICK OR TO BE PRETTY MUCH USE WITH ANYTHING IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SONG

YOU ALMOST NEVER IN WITH SOMEONE IS SHOCKED REALLY HAS ARRIVE WIDE OPEN YOU ALMOST NEVER SEE THE ENTIRETY OF YOUR IRIS
AND REALLY THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE IT IN MY OPINION IS TO A DEGREE THEM WITH OPEN ARMS TREAT EVERYONE WITH THE TYPE OF RESPECT THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE TREATED WITH AND THEN YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE IF YOU DO THAT
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN A RUNNING BACK COMES THROUGH FIRST OF ALL HE WANTS TO BE LOW HE WANTS TO BE OPEN IN READY WITH HIS INSIDE HAND TO THE QUARTERBACK
IT'S GOT TO BE OPEN SO THE QUARTERBACK AND SLIDE THE BALL IN
IF YOU DO FIND THAT THERE'S A BUBBLE AND THE CONTACT SHEET YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE A PEN OR YOUR ALL JUST MAKE A LITTLE NECK IN THERE AND IT'S GOING TO OPEN IT UP SO THAT AIR CAN BE PUSHED OUT

THAT MEANS I'M GOING TO HAVE TO OPEN UP MY RIGHT LEG SO THAT IT'S NOT AGAINST DECIDE SAYING ON
THEN I'M GOING TO OPEN UP MY RIGHT RAIN SO HE HAS A PLACE IT GOES ALL YOU'VE ALREADY WANTED IT AND I'M GOING TO SQUEEZE WITH MY LEFT LEG

OKAY THE SIXTY DEGREE WEDGE IS REALLY LOFTED AND ONE THING I FORGOT TO MENTION PREVIOUS SEGMENTS MAYBE IS THAT IF YOU OPEN THE FACE YOUR CLUB IT DOES INCREASED THE LOFT OF WHICH MEANS IT PUTS THE BALL HIGHER
ONCE YOU TRY FOR YOUR HIGH SCHOOL TEAM IF YOU GET YOUR SKILLS OPEN UP THE WAY YOU CAN MAKE IT AND THAT'S A LOT OF HARD WORK
AND LAST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS GRAB SOME BREW OPEN IT UP AND TOP IT OFF
NOW WHEN YOU OPEN THAT UP FIRST ENOUGH POSSIBLY THE VINE
AND ON EVERY LOOP ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS PRESS THE A BUTTON IN WITH YOUR CALF SOCK OFF AND YOU'RE ABLE TO OPEN UP A WHOLE AUTOMATION SCREEN SET THAT LETS YOU CHANGE THE VOLUME AND RIGHT DIFFERENT CHANGES WITHIN YOUR SONG THAT AUTOMATICALLY ALM WORK AS A SONG PLAYS
SO YOU WANT TO GO RIGHT INTO THAT CREASE MAKE SURE IT'S REALLY BLENDED AND THAT'S GOING TO REALLY HELP SHAPE YOUR EYES AND MAKE THEM LOOK VERY OPEN
THERE MAY BE HOLDS THAT YOU CAN PULL STRAIGHT DOWN ON BUT THE MAIN UP A AND IF YOU'RE NOT OPEN TO THE IDEA OF USING HOLDS THAT DON'T LOOK LIKE LETTER RUNGS HUMUS OUT OF A LOT
OPEN CHORDS BASICALLY TALKS ABOUT FIRST POSITION CHORDS WHICH IS WITHIN THE FIRST THREE FRETS AND THEY'RE CALLED OPEN CHORDS BECAUSE YOU'RE UTILIZING OPEN STRINGS AND ALL OF THESE CHORDS
SO YOU'RE NOT FRETTING THEM LIKE IF YOU'RE PLAYING THE OPEN WHICH MEANS SIMPLY THAT THEY'RE NOT FRET
NOW WE SET THAT WE HAD IT OPEN D STRING IS THE ROOT
SO WHEN YOU'RE SERVING THE BALL TAKE THE BALL IN FRONT OF YOU TOSS IT IN FRONT OF YOU TAKE YOUR HAND BACK LEAD WITH YOUR ELBOW KEEP YOUR HAND OPEN AND SERVE THE BALL OVER THEM
FIRST THINGS FIRST YOU WANT TO ALWAYS KEEP YOUR HAND OPEN
IF YOU'VE EVER NOTICE WHEN YOU PULL ON YOUR HORSE AND A GOOD OPEN THEIR MOUTH YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY KIND OF CONTROL OUT OF THAT
THIS IS THE DOT THEM PALM PUNCH CHAMBER STAY THERE CHAMBER THIS NOW OPEN THIS HAND MELISSA TURN OVER NOW HERE STEP TO THE SIDE OKAY PALM BLOCK NOW STEP TOGETHER PUNCH
SO IT'S ADJUSTING THE DISTANCE FOR THE LENGTH OF THE STRING WITH SADDLE ADJUSTMENTS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PITCH OF THOSE THREE THINGS OPEN THE OCTAVE HARMONIC AND PLAYED NOTE ARE ALL EXACTLY THE SAME
MOST IMPORTANT AFTER THE CLASS TO OPEN BIKES BE MEALY
SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A SAFETY PIN OPEN IT UP AND BEND IT BACKWARDS
THAT WAY YOU HAVE SOME CLEARANCE TO SPREAD THE LEAD OPEN TO GET THE TERMINAL OFF THE BATTERY
AND WHAT I'M GOING TO BE DOING IS I WILL OPEN UP THE SAW ITSELF THE BLADE ITSELF AND REMOVE IT FROM ONE IN THE BASE AND AND THAT WILL BE FIT INTO A HOLE AND THEN I WILL THE PLACE IT BACK INTO THE HOLDER AGAIN THE SAW BLADE AND THEN TIGHTEN IT UP
THAT WOULD INSURE THAT THAT WHEN YOU DO OPEN THE SLIDE AND IF THE SLIDE GOES BACK FORWARD NO ROUNDS WILL COME OUT OF THE MAGAZINE AND GO INTO THE FIREARM CHAMBER
YOU WOULD OPEN PICKUP FIREARM WITHOUT TOUCHING THE TRIGGER KEEPING YOUR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER AT ALL TIMES
SO WE WANT TO DO IS JUST PULL THIS APART REALLY CATCH THE LINING WITH IT AND SO IT ALL TOGETHER WHEN IT OPEN THAT UP
AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU START TO RELAX YOUR CHEEKS WILL FEEL HOLLOW ALLOW THEM TO FEEL HOLLOW JAW SLIGHTLY OPEN
YOU CAN ACTUALLY BALANCE IT THERE WITHOUT IT SPINNING BUT IF YOU COULD PUT SOME SPIN ON IT AND HAVE THAT CLOG THE LEG AND THEN YOU CAN GO TO TWO FINGERS AND THEN ONE FINGER AND YOU'LL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GET CONTROL WHICH WILL OPEN UP THE DOOR TO MANY MANY MANY MORE TRICKS
INHALING OPEN THE HEART AND LIFT THE ARMS
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROCEDURES TO POP THOSE EYES OPEN
I'M GOING TO SHOVE IT THROUGH HERE AND THEN JUST OPEN IT UP
ONCE AGAIN THAT IS TO TRY THEIR TOES APART TO GET AN OPEN TO DRY
FROM HERE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR LEFT FOOT CROSS BEHIND AND OUR ARM IS GOING TO OPEN UP ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE SERVING TOGETHER IN A RESTAURANT AND YOU'RE GOING TO USE THAT AS MOMENTUM TO HELP GET YOU AROUND THREE YOU'RE GOING TO FIT HERE ON FOUR AND HANG OUT
SOMETIMES IF THEY GET BEND DOWN REAL FAR YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO OPEN YOUR KEY
AS YOU COME DOWN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ELBOWS DO NOT COMPLETELY OPEN SO WE WANT TO KEEP ON ALMOST IN LINE WITH THE SHOULDERS KEEP THE BRIDGE UP
WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP MAYBE I GOT ALTER THE DRUMS IT IN OUR LIBRARY AND JUST KIND OF SEE WILL KIND OF KITS THERE ARE AND REALLY JUST MESS AROUND WITH THEM BY CHANGING THE DIFFERENT CAKES USING THE GRID AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ULTRA BEAT AND USING PATTERN MODE BY TRIGGERING EACH PATTERN WHEN IT'S TIME AND RECORDING THAT DATA
ONCE THIS IS OPEN THIS IS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO CREATE EVERYTHING
WHAT THIS DOES IS IT CLOSES THE CHORDS THAT WE OPEN WITH THE HOT TOWEL OR THE HOT WATER
NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS KIND OF OPEN THIS SECTION UP HERE KIND OF GIVE IT A LITTLE ROOM AND HOLD RIGHT HERE AT THE POINT OF THE NECK
SO WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO FORM THE HEAD BY JUST OPEN THIS UP AND RABBIT EAR FOLDING THIS LIKE SO
NOW OPEN THE WINGS LIKE THIS AND THEN FOLD THEM DOWN PULLING OFF THIS POINT HERE GOING TO FOLD IT DOWN INTO A FORWARD FOLD
IF YOU OPEN IT UP AND SEE HERE THAT THE IT'S A GOOD STORAGE PLACE
I CAN OPEN IT DISCARD MY USE TEA LEAVES AND THEN RINSE IT OUT AND ENJOY THEM A CUP OF TEA
SO FROM THIS POSITION SHUT AN OPEN SHUT AND OPEN
SHOULDERS DOWN AND THE CHEST IS UP AN OPEN
THIS TIME WE ARE GOING TO BE USING THE SIXTH STRING THAT'S THAT OH IT'S TELLING US TO PLAY IT OPEN OR TO JUST PLUCK THE STRING WITHOUT PRESSING DOWN ON ANY FRETS
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOK AT OUR E SHAPE AND THE OPEN POSITION
SHE'S GOING TO CHAMBER THE HANDS TO THE WAIST START FROM THIS POSITION AND HANDS A LITTLE BIT LOWER ONE AND TWO BOTH HANDS COME OUT SAME TIME FIST GOOD KEEPING THEM RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR SHOULDERS OPEN THE HANDS THE PALM CROSS ONE WRIST OVER THE OTHER WRIST BRING THE HANDS DOWN TOUCH THE SIZE NOW LIFT UP BEND THE ELBOWS AND COME FORWARD
IN THIS CASE THE HEAT FROM TOO MUCH HEAT FROM ESCAPING AROUND YOUR NECK AND YOUR OPEN COLLAR AREA AND IT'S ALSO WORKS AS WELL AS A REGULATOR SO YOU CAN REGULATE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE
WHEN YOU START GETTING TOO WARM YOU CAN OPEN THE SCARF OR TAKE IT OFF AND THEN PUT THE SCARF BACK ON
HOPEFULLY YOU REMEMBERED TO SLICE OPEN THE BUTTON HOLES BEFORE YOU SEWED YOUR CASING
