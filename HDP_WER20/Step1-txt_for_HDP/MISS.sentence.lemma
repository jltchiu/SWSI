SO YOU WANT TO HAVE YOU MISS THE FIRST ONE AND THE FIRST ONE IS GOING TO GIVE YOU LOTS OF THE NOSE OF WHAT YOU MISS
ONCE YOU HAVE HIM IN YOUR CHAIR YOU CAN START TO ACCESSORIZE I'M ALSO GIVE THEM A ONCE OVER MAKE SURE YOU DON'T MISS ANYTHING
SOME EXAMPLES OF SOME EDGES BABY MISSES ZERO TO TWO YEARS OLD TIE NAME IS THREE TO FIVE YEARS OLD LITTLE MISS SIX TO EIGHT AND ON UP TO JUNIOR MINTS EIGHTEEN MINUTES AND MINUTES
NOW DON'T FORGET TO WORK YOUR ABS NEVER MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PULL THAT NAVEL IN TOWARDS YOUR SPINE
ONE AND ONE OF THE NEXT THING IS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT NOT EASY STEP TO MISS IS FILLING OUT THE WATER TANK WHICH THEY ON THIS MACHINE IS UNDER THIS UNDER THIS PLATE RIGHT HERE IN THE BACK OF THE MACHINE
AND THEN YOU CATCH ONE AND THEN YOU YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE YOU ARE IN SO YOU MISS THE ENTIRE SCHOOL ALTHOUGH THERE
IF YOU MISS LIKE THIS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO A FIVE FORTY TAIL TAP OR YOU'RE JUST GOING TO FALL
AND THE ODDS OF THAN THREE PUTTING ARE PRETTY HIGH NOT BECAUSE THEY MISS THE SECOND ONE SO MUCH AS THEY DIDN'T LAG THE FIRST ONE CLOSE ENOUGH TO WHERE IT WAS YOU KNOW JUST A TAP IT IN
NOW WHEN EVER YOU MISS ANYTHING IN A QUICK FASHION YOU'RE GOING TO BE WIGGLING THROUGH THE CENTER SHOULD BE NO WIGGLING THOUGH IF YOU ENGAGE PROPERLY
YOU KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING IN THE YELLOW PAGES YOU'RE LOOKING ONLINE FOR SOMEBODY YOU KNOW IT'S HITTER MISS YOU MAY GET SOMEBODY GOOD YOU MAY GET SOMEBODY BAD YOU DON'T KNOW
JUST DON'T MISS THE GLOVE BECAUSE THEN MODEL REALLY THE MINUTE
THEY MISS THE SHOT THESE TWO GUYS ARE FLYING OUT GOING THE OTHER WAY AND THE FIRST GUY ON THIS SIDE COMES INTO JOINT
SO WHEN YOU'RE SETTING THE BALL TAKE THE BALL ABOVE YOUR HEAD WHERE AS IF YOU MISS THE BALL I WOULD HIT YOU IN YOUR FOREHEAD
THESE GUYS EITHER MAKE THE SHOT OR THEY MISS THE SHOT
IT IT AND ONCE OF MINCED ALL OF THEM AND IT WILL GO AHEAD AND MIX THEM ALL TOGETHER ONE MORE TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT I DIDN'T MISS A BIG PIECES
