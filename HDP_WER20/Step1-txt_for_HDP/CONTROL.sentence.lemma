AND IF YOU BROKEN UP REALLY GOOD BUT YOU DIDN'T POCKET THE BALL AND YOU TURN CONTROL OF THE TABLE OVER TO YOUR OPPONENT ALL YOU'VE DONE IS JUST OPEN EVERYTHING UP SO THAT YOUR OPPONENT HAS AN EASY ROAD TO RUN OUT AND BE CHEW OFF OF YOUR OWN BREAK
HOWEVER IF YOU DON'T BREAK PROPERLY AND SAY YOU SCRATCH ON THE BRAKE OR YOU DON'T POCKET A BALL ALL YOU'RE DOING AT THAT POINT IS JUST TURNING CONTROL OVER THE TABLE TO YOUR OPPONENT
OR FEELING DEFENSIVE OR WE WANT TO CONTROL WHAT'S GOING ON AND PUT OUR OWN IDEAS OUT THERE
