NOW ALL I'M DOING IS ESSENTIALLY AIMING KEEP MY FINGER STRAIGHT AS I DIP IT UNDER MY ARM PIT OUT AROUND STRAIGHT MY ARM AND COME BACK OVER
SO I'M GOING TO WHAT I'M DOING THAT I'M GOING TO SPREAD THE FIRE OR SPREAD THE THE COALS AROUND A LITTLE BIT AND TRY TO REALLY KEEP SEARCHING FOR THE STUFF THAT STILL HOT STILL BURNING WE'RE GOING TO SPREAD IT AROUND AS MUCH AS I CAN KEEPING IT WITHIN THE PIT THE WHOLE TIME
ONE IS TO USE THE GRID FILLED IN HAS OF THE PIT USUALLY IN A SMALL OF VERSION
AND THIS IS MY FRIENDS LOLLY WHO IS MY DOG SHE'S A MUST WRITING SHEPARD AND SHE'S GOING TO HELP ME TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE AMERICAN PIT BOLT CARRIER
ANOTHER WAY OF DOING THIS IS BY TAKING AND HAVING YOUR NATURAL PIT DUGOUT
A IT UP NOW THAT YOU'VE ROUGHED UP ALL THE GLASS ON THAT SURFACE YOU'LL TAKE JUST SOME REGULAR RESIN YOU'LL DAB THIS ON TAKE SOME PIT RESIN APPLY YOUR PATCH MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET NOW ALL OF THE AIR BUBBLES SO THAT IT'S MOSTLY PIT RESIN IS JUST SITTING ON THE GLASS
SO WHAT I'D THEN DO IS I JUST TAKE A COUPLE OF THE PIT PIECES AT A TIME PUT IT INTO THE DISH
YOU WOULD NORMALLY PIT DESIGNER FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT EASIER BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING WELL AND GENERALLY I WANT TO YOU KNOW DOUBLE THE PRICE OF OF MY COSTS RIGHT
