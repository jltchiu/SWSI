LOW CENTER GRAVITY WITH THE HIPS ESTABLISH THE BASE WITH THE ARMS
YOU KEEP YOUR ARMS RIGHT SHOULDER LEVEL RIGHT AND YOU ESTABLISH A WIDE BASE
A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT BE WONDERING WHY I COIL BASE PAINTING GETS OUT OF A DRAMATIC
SO WE'VE GOT OUR BASE COAT DOWN AND NOW YOU START THINKING OF DIFFERENT COLORS THAT YOU CAN LAYER UP WITH
SO YOU'RE GOING TO PULL ALL THE MUSCLES IN THE BASE OF YOUR PELVIC FLOOR
AND WE WILL MARBLE IT INTO THE CHEESECAKE BASE WILL RESERVE ONE THIRD OF THE CURL MIX WE'RE ACTUALLY TOPPING THE CAKE AND BE DOING THAT A LITTLE LATER
A GOOD UTILITY MAN LIKE WILSON BOTTOM IT FOR THE NEW YORK YANKEES IS ABLE TO FILL IN AT THIRD BASE HE'S ABLE TO FILL IN A SHORT STOP SECOND BASE SOMETIMES SPELL THE FIRST BASEMAN
AND YOU WANT IT TO COME OFF ON THE INSIDE OF THE BASE
NOW WE MIGHT HAVE A DATABASE WE MIGHT SAY WELL THIS GUY DOESN'T NEED A LETTER OR HE GOT A LETTER LAST WEEK SO HERE YOU CAN PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH PEOPLE FROM YOUR DATA BASE I'M GOING TO RECEIVE THE DOCUMENT THE MALE MERCHANT YOU'RE CREATING
IT WILL POP WAY UP THE AIR AND AS IT HITS THE OTHER PARTS OF THE CLUB IT MIGHT NOT BOUNCE UP AS HIGH BUT YOU CAN DEFINITELY GAIN A FEW OF HOW HIGH IT'S GOING TO BE BOUNCING AND THE KIND OF WHAT DIRECTIONS CAN BE GOING BY WHERE IT'S ON THE BASE OF THE CLUB
SO THIS YELLOW ORANGE BLUE VIOLET IS GOING TO NEUTRALIZE THAT AND MAKE A NICE BROWN BASE
MOST THE TIME THEY'RE NOT USE BECAUSE FRIENDS OF PHOTOGRAPHY IS REALLY TYPE OF LIGHTING YOU WANT TO USE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS HEAT BASE
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE PART OF THE STICK THAT STICKING OUT SHOULD BE BOTH OF THEM SHOULD BE EVEN SO THAT THE FRAME STAND STRAIGHT UP AND BUT BY THE WEIGHT OF THE THE BORDER THE THICKNESS OF THE CORRUGATED PAPER AND ALSO THE STICKS THAT ARE INSIDE THIS WILL CREATE A NICE STRONG STURDY SUPPORT TO LET THE THE BORDER STAND UP STRAIGHT ON TO THE BASE OF THE STAGE
SO NOW I'VE SHOWN YOU HOW TO INSERT THE WOODEN SKEWER STICKS INTO THE PICTURE FRAME BORDER SO THAT IT WILL STAND DIRECT ONTO THE BASE OF OUR PUPPET STAGE THEATER
NOW IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO LOTS AND LOTS OF YOUR ON WORK YOU CAN GET ONE THAT DOES NOT HAVE THIS POWER BASE AND IT'S JUST A HANDLE LIKE THIS
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER IN PAINT IT'S USUALLY A WATER BASE LOT THICKER ON THE EASE OF GETTING IT OFF IT'S GENERALLY DEPEND ON HOW LONG IT'S BEEN ON THERE
THIS IS YOUR MORE OF A GENERIC PAINT IT'S USUALLY A VEGETABLE BASE OIL
NOW AS THE RUNNER IS CALMING OKAY AS HE'S PUSHING TOWARDS THE BASS OR MOMENTUM AS HE'S ABOUT TO FALL GET LOW AND THEN EXTEND WITH BOTH OF OUR HANDS GOING TO THE BASE
NOW NORMALLY WHEN YOU'RE STEALING SECOND BASE THIS IS A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE SLIDE AS IF YOU'RE SLIDING REGULARLY WITH FEET AHEAD GOING TO SECOND BASE
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS RIGHT AFTER WE PLANTED OUR PLANT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OURSELVES A LITTLE EARTHEN DAM FEW INCHES DEEP SO THAT THE WATER THAT WE PUT IN HERE AT THE BASE OF THE PLANT STAYS HERE
AND THEN I WANT TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF A HIGHLIGHT IN THE CORNER OF THE EYE SO I'M GOING TO TAKE THE SAME COLOR THAT SHIMMERY COLOR THAT I USED AS A BASE AND I'M GOING TO PUT THAT RIGHT IN THE CORNER OF HER EYE
AND WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS GET A TEMPLE IN YOUR HEAD AS EVEN AS POSSIBLE ONE TWO AND JUST PLAY EVERY STRING AND KEEP ALTERNATING YOUR FINGERS AND WORK ON GETTING A NICE BIG SOUND ON YOUR BASE
A FULL SCORE HAS ALL THE PARTS OF THE ENSEMBLE IT'S A STRING ORCHESTRA HAS THE VIOLIN VIOLA CHARLES DOUBLE BASE AND IT'S A SYMPHONIC ORCHESTRA IT WILL HAVE ALL THE STRINGS THE WOODWINDS AND THE BRASS AND PERCUSSION
OKAY SO OUR BASE ALASKA
AND WE'RE READY TO PUT OUR MERINGUE ON OUR BACON MASCARA BASE
WE'VE ALREADY GLUED UP THE PIECES FOR THE BASE AND WHILE THEY'RE DRYING WE'RE GOING TO CUT THE LONGER TO MAKE THE TALL PIECE THAT GOES IN THE MIDDLE
OKAY LET'S TALK ABOUT PLAYING SOME NOTES ON THE BASE
YOU HAVE YOUR YOUR BASE AND THEN YOU HAVE YOUR LITTLE HOLE
SO I'M GOING TO APPLY THIS BASE PAINT OVER IT OVER THE MASKING TAPE AND THAT WILL HELP ME PLACE A NICE EVEN COAT OF COLORED PAINT ALONG THE PICTURE FRAME
AND WHEN YOU'RE WORKING ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU CAN WORK YOUR CLOTHES YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ANYTHING SPECIAL ANY SPECIAL OILS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT JUST COME THROUGH AND KIND OF WORK A LITTLE BIT ON THE BACK WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT YOU JUST YOU CAN USE YOUR LOOSE FIST RIGHT HERE JUST PRESS IN TO THE MUSCLES IN THE BACK AREA YOU CAN RUB TO THE NECK LIKE THIS A LITTLE BIT AND RUB ESPECIALLY ALONG THE OCCIPITAL AREA HERE AT THE BASE OF THE SKULL
IT FEELS REALLY GOOD AND WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS DO LITTLE LIFT WE JUST KIND OF USE THE FOREHEAD AND THE BASE OF THE OF THE SKULL AND LIFT UP THE COLOR LEAVES A LOT OF TENSION IN PEOPLE'S NECK AND HELPS THEM
NOW THE FRAME THAT WE'VE CREATED NEEDS A WAY TO STAND UP ONTO THE BASE OF OUR STAGE SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A THE MAKE THE WOODEN STICKS GO INSIDE THE CORRUGATED PAPER AND THAT WILL CREATE A STAND IN ORDER FOR US TO STICK IT INSIDE THE BASE OF THE STAGE
SO WE PUT IN HIGH ENOUGH SO THAT IT CREATES A WILL BE STURDY TO CREATE A NICE BASE AND WE SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH LEFT OUT TO BE ABLE TO STICKING TO THE BASE OF THE STAGE
KIND OF CREATE A NICE FOUNDATION BASE
MAYBE BECAUSE THE KNOB METAL A BASE METAL WITH THE COST CORROSION
FIRST OF ALL YOU WANT TO START WITH A GOOD BASE
YOU COULD USE ANY METAL FRAME YOU WANT AS LONG AS THE BASE OF THE BED HAS A CENTER SUPPORT SYSTEM UNDERNEATH IT
I GET A SMALL BASE
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS WITH REALLY WHITE FEET BECAUSE IF I NEED TO MOVE MY BODY AROUND I NEED TO HAVE SOME MOBILITY WITH ME SO I GET KIND OF A NARROW BASE
FOR FIVE SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH AND EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW TO UTILIZE THE DIFFERENT NOTES AT FEET DEGREE IS THAT WE SEE COMING OUT OF THE BASE
SO NOW THEY GET A SENSE OF ATTACK THEY GET A SENSE OF A WEAPON THEY GET A SENSE OF WHAT TARGETS BEING THREAD AND SO THIS BASE THE TECHNIQUE VERY EFFECTIVE
I'M GOING TO THROW IT IN AND I AM I GOING TO BRING DOWN THE BASE
NOW ONE OF THE KEY TRAITS THAT ALL GOOD FIRST AND THIRD BASE COACH THAT WAS AT THE VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND THEY'RE VERY CONSISTENT WITH THE SAME
SO LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE YOU GOT A GUY ON FIRST BASE YOU TELL FREEZE ON A LINE
AND WHAT IT HAS IS IT HAS A CONDENSER MOTOR IN THE BASE OF THE REFRIGERATOR AND BE IN THE BACK HERE
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GRAB THE BASE OF THE BODY IN THE PANTS TOGETHER AS WELL AS THE BACK OF THE NECK OF YOUR SCARECROW AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO PUT THEM IN YOUR CHAIR AND SLIDE DOWN AND IF YOU HAVEN'T STUFF PROPERLY HE'S GOING TO STAND UP ON AS WELL AND YOU HAVE YOUR HEAD PIN DOWN SECURELY THAT'S GOING TO STAND UP AS WELL
BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY THESE ORNAMENTS ON THE SECONDARY MARKET OR USED ON THE YEAR THAT IT WASN'T PUT OUT IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO USE THIS IS A BASE WHEN YOU BUY YOUR ORNAMENTS
USING YOUR FINGER UNDERNEATH AS A BASE SO THAT THE BRAID DOESN'T MOVE IN SPACE FLAT
NOW A CARTWHEEL IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S A BASE FUNDAMENTAL TO BUILD ON AND GET YOUR CONFIDENCE SET FOR DOING ANY SORT OF TUMBLE AT ALL
IT'S AN OIL BASE SOLUTION ON THE TOP PORTION FLOATING ON TOP OF THE WATER BASE SOLUTION ON THE BOTTOM
WRAP IT AROUND THE BASE
ONCE IN DANCE THE FISH HAVE DORSAL IN ANAL FINS TO EXTEND WELL BE ON THE BASE OF THE TAIL AND USUALLY ARE MORE POINTED THEN ROUNDED
START WITH A BASE COAT THAT IS RECOMMENDED FOR YOUR TYPE OF NAIL
IF IT'S DRY NOW USING A POLISH A BASE COAT DESIGNED FOR DRY NAILS
I'M GOING TO NEED SOME WHITE THICK BASE PAINT
IF YOU SCROLL DOWN YOU'LL SEE YOU YOU'RE GIVEN A BASE PRICE AND A TOTAL PRICE OF THE LOW RETAIL AN AVERAGE RETAIL NUMBER
AND THIS ONE WE'RE GOING TO DO IS THE OPEN TOE CUT OUT PLATFORM AND THIS BASE HERE THE WHITE IS ACTUALLY A CUT OUT THAT IF YOU WERE TO LOOK THROUGH IT AND YOU SEE WHATEVER THE OTHER SIDE OF IT
THE CUTICLE PUSHER I HAVE THREE TYPES RIGHT HERE NAIL CLIPPERS CUTICLE CLIPPERS YOU'LL ALSO NEED YOUR POLISHES THE SHAPE THAT YOU DESIRE YOUR BASE COAT AND TOP COAT
SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IN THAT CASE THIS TAKE THE STEM OUT OF THE VASE AND GIVE IT ANOTHER FRESH CUT SO THAT YOU'RE OPENING UP THE BASE OF THE STEM AGAIN AND IT'S DRINK OF WATER OKAY
AGAIN REMOVE THE LEAVES CUT THE STEM PUT HIM IN THE BASE
SOME ARE JUST PLAY THAT LITTLE FIGURE AND REST ON THE ONE OF THE FOR A SIXTEENTH NOTE SO IT'S ONE TWO SO WE GOT QUARTER NOTES ON THE BASE SO ONE E AND UH ONE E AND UH TWO E AND THREE E AND UH FOUR E AND UH ONE E AND UH TWO E AND THREE E AND UH FOUR E AND
AND GO BASE WHICH AGAIN THERE IS A BUSY STRUM THAT OVER BASIC DRUM BEAT
AND ONE OF THE TOPICS IS HOW TO RESTRING A BASE
BUT I'M THE MAIN THING IS YOU DON'T WANT TO EVER DO ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO DAMAGE YOUR BASE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
SO REMEMBER THAT BEING A GOOD COMMUNICATOR IS VERY IMPORTANT TO BEING A BASE
SO HERE I'VE GOT A BASE THAT HAS THE LOW E STRING TAKEN OFF
NOW SOME BASS IS HAVE THE HAVE THE HOLES IN THE BACK OF THE BASE
SO I SLIDE UP BASE MY BODY KEEP MY BODY LEVEL HERE KEEP MY HANDS UP FOR THE RIGHT LEG LEAD SIDE KICK STEP FORWARD SHIFT REVERSE PUNCH TURN THE FOOT OUT
YOU HAVE ONE DOWN AT THE BASE OF THE SPINE THAT'S RED
LET ME A LITTLE LITTLE BLACK CIRCLES INSIDE THE BLUE CIRCLES DRAW ON SOME EYEBROWS AND SOME EYELASHES IN A COUPLE LITTLE MARKS ON THE BEAK THERE AND THAT CREATES THE BASE OF THE DUCK RIGHT THERE
NOW WE'RE GOING TO APPLY THE WHITE BASE PAINT TO THE BOXES
BUT SINCE WE'RE GOING TO ATTACH THESE TO A BASE
AND IT GIVES IT A GOOD BASE AND FOUNDATION WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT
NOW WITH THE OPEN PART POINT IT TOWARDS YOU THIS WILL BECOME THE TOP TRIANGLE BECOME THE BASE OF THE FLOWER
VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEM HAVE OUR VENEER THE KNEES CURVES AND THE OFTEN WITH MAHOGANY OR ROSEWOOD USUALLY ON A PINE BASE
WE FEEL IT'S LIKE A LIGHT BASE WHICH IS CLOSE TO THE OTHER ONE AND A TEAL BLUE
WELL THE FIRST BASE WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU IS OUR LEAKING THOUGH
SO ONCE YOU DO THAT THEN WE MOVE UP TO THE OTHER END OF THE BASE
WE'VE GOT SOME BASS OUR VEGETABLE BASE FOR OUR RICE WE'RE GOING TO NEED SOME OIL SOME GARLIC SOME RICE VINEGAR SALT AND PEPPER REGULAR WHITE VINEGAR AND SOME SOY SAUCE
THIS IS WHEN THE BATTER SWINGS THE BAT MAKES CONTACT WITH THE CATCHER'S GLOVE OR THE CATCHER SOME OF THE CATCHER GETS IN THE WAY SOMEHOW UP THE BATTER SO HE DOES GET ON BASE
YOU STILL DENOTED DENOTE THAT WITH AN INT BUT YOU DRAW YOUR LINE ADVANCING FROM HOME TO FIRST BASE
SO I'M STARTING AT THE BASE OF HER LASHES AND THEN WORKING MY WAY UP TO THE ENDS
AND I HAVE FOUND THAT I CAN SIT DOWN WITH THE CHILD AND I CAN JUST USING THE ALPHABET OKAY AS OUR BASE OF OPERATIONS
AS YOU CAN SEE WE'RE CREATING THE THE FOLD BASE ON THE INSIDE HERE
IN THIS CAN GIVE KIND OF LIKE SOMETIMES CALLED OIL A WALKING BASS SOUND OR I'M KIND OF LIKE A LOT OF THIS OR LIKE THE LOW BLUESY BASE NOTE KIND OF ADDED TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING
AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO START OFF WITH OUR BIRD BASE
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE WE'RE GOING TO START WITH A SQUARE PIECE OF PAPER IT'S ALREADY PRECREASED FOR THE BIRD BASE WE CAN JUST GO THROUGH THIS RATHER QUICKLY
AND TO GO INTO OUR BIRD BASE WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THESE FLAPS HERE AND FOLD THEM IN TO THE CENTER LINE THAT IS ALREADY BEEN CREATED HERE FROM OUR PREVIOUS FOLDS
ONE THING ALSO ABOUT ADVANTAGE IS THAT WHEN THE REFEREE GIVES THAT YOU CAN ALSO STILL AND OUT OF OUR OWN SO EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY OF LATELY TAKING SOME ON OUR BASE TO MAINTAIN SESSION MY THEY DON'T COLOR RIGHT AWAY THE REFEREE THAT ARE
AND NOW WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS TO PUT MY HAND ON THE FLOOR BROADER CURVE IT AROUND THE BASE FOR THOSE WHO ARE THE BALANCE TRAINER
THE PILATES AT THE BASE OF YOUR HAIR FOLLICLE AND WAS YOUR BLOOD PASSES THROUGH IT GRABS ALL THE NUTRIENTS AND NEEDS IN ORDER TO GROW YOUR HAIR FAT IN ORDER TO GROW YOUR HAIR
SO THIS IS JUST ANOTHER WEBSITE BUILDER THAT YOU CAN USE AND LIKE I SAID IT'S TEMPLATE BASE
THIS IS A FROG BASE
THIS IS A FAIRLY SIMPLE MODEL IF YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE A FROG BASE
SO STARTING WITH THE FROG BASE WE ARE GOING TO FOLD EACH OF THESE TRIANGLES DOWN LIKE THIS
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT CURRY IS BUT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT'S IS THE BASE OF A KARIE
AND THIS IS A STOCK IN THE COMB OF THE SHOTGUN AND KIND OF WHAT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IS BRING THAT TO YOUR SHOULDER AND BASE SIMULTANEOUSLY
ONE OTHER THING WE CAN DO IS THE TRIM ON THE BACK WHERE THAT BASE WAS A A PLUGGED INTO GO AHEAD AND JUST BRING THAT BACK DOWN TO A TO ENOUGH AND JUST IN CASE WHEN YOU GO TO DO SOMETHING ELSE LATER YOU DON'T HAVE A HIGH LEVEL ON DAMAGE OR YEARS OR SOMETHING
YOU ALSO MAY HAVE A PERSON WHO'S A LITTLE MORE RED OR A LITTLE MORE SWELLING UNDER THE EYES SO THAT USUALLY WILL BE RIGHT UNDER THE LASH LINE THE LOWER LASH LINE SO YOU WOULD WANT TO USE A GREEN BASE THERE
IN USING TAPE AND A COMPUTER TOGETHER BECAUSE I THINK YOU GET THE BEST BOTH ROLLED ROLLS THIS WAY A TIME CODE WILL SINK UP YOUR TAPE WITH YOUR PRO TOOLS AND THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE EXPERT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO BOOK A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR IN OUR ROOM TO DO IT BUT IF YOU RECORD YOUR DRUMS AND BASE TO TAPE SINK THAT UP AND THEN PLAY GUITAR IS A TO YOUR VOCALS DIGITALLY YOU REALLY DO HAVE THE MARRIAGE OF GETTING THAT THE CERTAIN LOW IN REPRESENTATION OF TAPE IS IN THE WALK TO THE DEPTH OF THE GIVES THAT RANGE AND STILL HAVEN'T EASE OF EDITING AND AND TUNING AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS AT EASE OF OPERATION THE QUICKNESS THAT OF RECORDING THE DISTILLATE ROUND GIVES YOU
TWELVE IS A GOOD NUMBER FOR YOUR BASE RIGHT
SO YOU'RE GOING TO BRING IT UP TO THE BASE OF THE HEAD AND BRING IT DOWN
OPEN IT UP AND WE ARE GOING TO DO A SWIVEL FOLD BY PINCHING THE BASE OF THE TAIL TOGETHER WE ARE GOING TO FOLD IT AT AN ANGLE DOWN LIKE SO
HOLDING IT SO THAT THE SINK FOLD IS ON THE BOTTOM THAT'S THE BASE OF OUR HORSE WE ARE GOING TO OPEN UP THE TAIL THE POINT THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LITTLE TRIANGLE FOLD IT DOWN
SAME THING AS WE DID WITH THE TAIL DO A CLIENT FOLD WITH THE BASE OF THE HEAD SWIVEL FOLD ON BOTH SIDES
IF YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO LEFT FIELDER PLAYING SECOND BASE
I'M GOING TO USE THE SAME COLOR THAT I USED AS A BASE THAT LIGHT PINKIES SILVER COLOR AND I'M GOING TO USE THAT JUST ADD A LITTLE DEEPER UNDERNEATH THE BROW AND ALSO IN THE INSIDE CORNER OF THE EYE JUST ADD SOME SOME HIGHLIGHTS TO THE EYE AND THIS IS GOING TO REALLY OPEN THE I MAKE IT LOOK FOLDED FINISH OFF THE LOOK
AND I'M GOING TO DRAW SO THE BIGGEST PIECES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT LIKE SAY THE EXHAUST HEIGHT WHICH WILL COME AND RUN ALONG THE BASE AND COME UP AND OUT
WIDE BASE ARMS OUT TO ESTABLISH CONTACT LOW CENTER GRAVITY BALL COMES OFF AT LEAST TWO FEET AWAY FROM THE RIB ESTABLISHED CONTACT FIRST GET AGGRESSIVELY GET THE BASKETBALL
SO THERE'S MANY TEA INSIDE AND THEN I'LL SCREWED ON AND IT MAY LOOK LIKE THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF TEA AND A LOT TO EMPTY SPACE IN HERE THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE WHAT LOOSE TEA NEEDS IS BASE FOR THE LEAVES TO REALLY EXPAND ON AS THEY TAKE ON WATER
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS GO AHEAD AND SELECT PORTRAIT AS MY BASE STYLE
BUT I LIKE TO SEE THE STUDENTS TO MAKE THE BASE OF THE BASE OF A TRIANGLE AND YOU WANT TO GET THE BALL RIGHT OVER YOUR HEAD THE APEX
WHEREAS THE DUSTY DAMSEL FISH FINS AND JUST ADD OR JUST PAST THE BASE OF THE TAIL AND OUR ROUNDED
SO WHEN I HAVE TO APPLY A CORRECTIVE BASE I CHOOSE A COLOR THAT HAS A BLUE BASE
AND THAT ASH BASE WILL THEN COUNTERACTS THAT WE WANT IN YOUR HAIR AND MAKE A NICE NEUTRAL COLOR
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO CHOOSE MAYBE AN ASH BASE
CLICK ON THAT AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO SCROLL UP TO INTERNET EXPLORER LET'S CLICK ON THAT AND THEN CLICK ON THE SEARCH ENGINE AND GO TO A NICE BASE DOT COM FOR AND CLICK ENTER OR YOU CAN CLICK SEARCH BUTTON ON THE RIGHT
SO NOW I'M GOING TO TAKE MY HARD RIB I'M GOING TO PUSH IN AT THE BASE I'M GOING TO SPIN THIS OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A UNTIL IT'S ABOUT THE HEIGHT THAT I'M LOOKING FOR
IN THIS NEXT STEP WE'RE GOING TO CREATE THE OUTER PEDALS OF OUR FLOWER FOR THE POLYMER CLAY BASE
SO LET'S SEE I WOULD PROBABLY GO WITH SOMETHING A LITTLE YELLOW BASE I'M KIND OF IN BETWEEN THERE
SO YOU SEE WE ARE MISSING MISSING THE BOTTOM AND WE'RE MESS IN THE BACK BUT WITH THIS PIECE ONCE WE RE FINISH THE WOOD IT'S VERY EASY TO COME BACK AND CUT SOME BACK PIECES AND THEN COVER THOSE WITH SOME KIND OF A OF A FABRIC IN SOME BATTING TO CREATE A NEW BASE
WE'RE GOING TO KIND OF SET OURSELVES UP WITH THE BASE AND SNARE DRUM PATTERN AND REALLY SEE WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THAT HIGH HAT
THE GROUND BASE CAN REALLY TIPS LIFE
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I GET A LITTLE BIT WIDER RIGHT HERE ARE STUCK IN IS RIGHT LEG COMES AROUND NOW IS AT A STRONG BASE TO RECOVER BACK
ALRIGHT AND THEN YOU LET IT REST ON THE LITTLE BASE AND STAND THERE
THERE'S A A CLASP ON THE BACK FOR TIGHTENING AND YOU WANT TO SIT ON THE BASE OF THE SKULL FAIRLY SNUG
THESE ARE TRIMMING TOOLS WE USE THESE ONCE THE BOWL HAS DRIED OUT AND WE'LL FLIP IT OVER AND USE THESE TO TRIM THE BASE OF IT
SO NOW THAT YOU'VE GOT YOUR BASE AND YOUR LID ALL FINISHED WITH THE KNOB YOU CAN CUT THIS RIGHT OFF THE BAT WITH YOUR WIRE TOOL BY PRESSING IT AGAINST THE BAT AND PULLING IT UNDERNEATH AND THEN TILT THAT PIECE RIGHT OFF THE BAT
CERTAIN COME TO LEAN SENT TO METAPHORICALLY RESIDE AT THE BASE OF THE SPINE CALLED COIL THREE AND A HALF TIMES OR ON THE ROOT CHOKER
AND THEN I'M GOING TO REFINE THE EDGE OF THIS WITH THIS SAME YELLOW AND THE EDGE OF THAT POT OR THE BASE OF THE SAME YELLOW UNTIL IT COMES DOWN HITS THE BACK OF OUR KITTY CAT
TO WANT TO STAY AT HOME MORE TO MAKE THE HUMP IN THE HOME A HOME BASE AND EVERYTHING COMES OUT FROM THE HOME
BUT TWELVE FOR THIS MEDIUM WEIGHT YARN IS A GOOD NUMBER FOR OUR BASE CIRCLE SO IT CAN GET TO YOU
BUT TODAY WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS MORE ON THE ON THE SOFTER MORE GENTLE SAUCES ALONG WITH OUR CURRY THEY ARE COOKING OUR MAT BASE
SEVEN AND SEVEN ON THE G AND THE SLIDING UP TO THE NINE BACK TO SEVEN AND BACK TO THE SIX TO THE FIFTH FRET AND THE WHOLE TIME JUST BASE OF THE FINGER STYLE PATTERN WILL BE A JUST A PINCH AND THEN USE MY MIDDLE FINGER FOR THE OPEN B THE ENTIRE TIME OKAY
SO NEXT I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO TRIM A FOOT ON THE BASE OF YOUR MUG
NOT SWORD ABOUT THE THE TEXTURE UNDERNEATH OF THE MASKING TAPE AND THE WHITE BASE PAINT WHICH ALSO WHEN I'M KIND OF THICK BECAUSE THE TEXTURE IS KIND OF A KIND OF LIKE HAVING THE LITTLE BIT OF TEXTURE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PICTURE FRAME
NOW THAT THE COAT OF BASE PAINT THAT I'VE PUT ON HAS DRIED I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND COLOR THE PICTURE FRAME WITH MY YELLOW ACRYLIC PAINT
THIS WORKS FOR US TO CLOSE TO THE MIDDLE OF THE BALL IS DEAD BEFORE IT'S TROLLING BASE WILL USUALLY CLEANED UP AND ALSO THE TOTAL CLEAN UP THE IF YOUR CARD IT TO A SPRAY PAINT
THESE ARE PRETTY BASE HEAVY MINORS AND THESE ARE PRETTY FLAT MIND IS THAT I USE TO MIX
ONCE YOU BUILD YOUR BASE YOU CAN BEGIN TO ADD ON THE TOP OF IT BY USING JUST HAND FORMING PACKING PILES OF SAND ON THE SIDES
BUT FIRST WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS WRAP THE HERE AROUND PUSHING IT AS CLOSE TO THE BASE HOLDING IT AS CLOSE TO THE BASE AS POSSIBLE
THIS IS GOING TO BE YOUR BASE THIS PLAYER SPIN LATER ON THIS IS A REALLY CRUCIAL PART
BASE THE SAME DIRECTION BRING THIS UP AND STRETCH WITH MY ARMS UP
WITH YOUR BASE IT MAYBE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER OR LOWER POSITION DEPENDING ON HOW IT'S SET UP
THE NEXT THING YOU NEED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE STONES IS A LIGHT COLOR TOWEL FOR THE BASE
SO THAT IT'S REAL IT'S WINDING DOWN TOWARDS THE BASE
BASICALLY THE EDIT IS GOING TO CONTAIN YOUR OFFLINE PROCESSING OFF THE FADE IS GOING TO HOLD ALL OF YOUR FADING FILES IN THE IMAGES IS JUST GOING TO CONTAIN THE IMAGE FILES FOR ON AUDIO THAT YOU'RE USING CUE BASE SO THAT IT CAN BE DRAWN QUICKLY
HERE'S MY C DRIVE AND IT'S GOING TO SAY MY CUE BASE PROJECT SO I'M GOING TO CLICK IN THERE AND YOU'LL SEE A FILE CALLED MY PROJECT OR ONE THAT'S CPR THAT'S THE ACTUAL FILE THAT WE JUST SAVED OUT AND YOU'LL SEE A FOLDER THAT SAYS AUDIO THIS IS CREATED AUTOMATICALLY WHEN YOU CREATE THE DIRECTOR
AND AT THE BASE OF THE SAW BLADE
AND WHAT I'M GOING TO BE DOING IS I WILL OPEN UP THE SAW ITSELF THE BLADE ITSELF AND REMOVE IT FROM ONE IN THE BASE AND AND THAT WILL BE FIT INTO A HOLE AND THEN I WILL THE PLACE IT BACK INTO THE HOLDER AGAIN THE SAW BLADE AND THEN TIGHTEN IT UP
IT MAKES IT A FLAT BASE TO LOOK GOOD LOOK AT LOOKING AND WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF TURN THAT OFF STRAIGHT RIGHT AWAY YOU SWEEP FOR OFF
NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO PLAYING SOME NOTES ON OUR BASE
SO THE STAPLES IS ON THE BASE OF THE MOST THE EASIEST WAY TO ATTACH THE CURTAINS AND IT'S ALSO PROBLEM ALL OF THEM MOST SECURE WAY SO THAT'S WHY WE CHOSE TO USE IT
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE PRESENTED WITH YOUR MAIN CUE BASE WINDOW HERE
SO I'M GOING TO CLICK ON MY C DRIVE AND CLICK CREATE AND THIS IS GOING TO CREATE A FOLDER ALL CALL THIS A MY CUE BASE PROJECT
IT LOOKS IT'S A PORCELAIN BASE MATERIAL
THE BASE IS UNIQUE I'M ON THE STRING INSTRUMENTS
