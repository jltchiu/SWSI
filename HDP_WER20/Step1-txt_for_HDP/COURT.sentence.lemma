THE FRONT COURT ALL UP AND THEN THE STRAIGHT DROP
YOU CAN DEFINITELY USE A TENNIS COURT WHICH WILL DEFINITELY HELP YOUR GAME BUT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED THAT
SO FROM THAT JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED TO KEEP IN MIND WHENEVER YOU'RE PLAYING RIGHT AROUND THE HALF COURT LINE SO
NOW WHEN YOU'RE FIRST TAKING THE BALL OUT YOU WANT TO YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO CROSS THE HALF COURT LINE BEFORE EIGHT TO TEN SECONDS
USED TO BE TEN SECONDS AND MY DAY WHEN I PLAY BUT I'VE SEEN WHERE THEY COUNTED THEY'VE CANDIDATE SO YOU WANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND WHENEVER YOU'RE PLAYING BALL THAT YOU GOT ACROSS THE HALF COURT LINE AND YOU CAN NEVER CAN NEVER PASS IT BACK ACROSS THAT THAT LINES ONCE YOU'VE CROSSED OVER INTO THE OFF IT SO THAT THE THE FRONT COURT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A HALF COURT LINE YOU WOULD ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND THAT ONCE YOU CROSS AS A TEAM ANYONE ON THE OFFENSE ONCE YOU CROSS BACK CROSS THAT LINE WHICH ACROSS THAT LINE YOU CANNOT CROSS BACK
ONE OTHER THING WE TALK ABOUT THE HALF COURT LINE AND COMES ACROSS RIGHT ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE COURT
OUR BEFORE YOU GET ON THE TENNIS COURT IS THAT YOU NEED TO
IN CHINESE MEDICINE THERE'S A DIAGNOSIS THAT WE USE CALLED BLOOD DEFICIENCY AND BLOOD DEFICIENCY DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOUR COURT LOW IT JUST MEANS THAT THE BLOOD ISN'T AS STRONG AS IT SHOULD BE ISN'T THE CARRYING THE NUTRIENTS TO WHERE IT SHOULD
SO EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE THEORETICALLY IN FRONT OF THIS LINE SO WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO CHILLED EACH OTHER BOAT WE HAVE TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN THE FRONT COURT
HALF COURT TRIANGLES CAN BE VERY PROBLEMATIC
SO YOU CAN DO QUITE A WORKOUT DOING THIS DRILL IS THE FRONT COURT CAN GET PRETTY GOOD
I'VE GOT A FEW GOOD ONES FROM TASMANIA AND THAT EVEN IN ITALY AN OFFENSIVE COURT TO FOR EXAMPLE THEY MAKE NICE METHOD JUST IN A WINES
YOU CAN PUT THEM IN A CHAIR PUT THEM ON THE FRONT COURT
SO YOU WANT TO DO SOME STRETCHES GET WARMED UP AND BE ABLE TO GET ON THE COURT QUICKLY
WHEN YOU KEEP YOUR HAND UP AND YOU HAVE MORE SURFACE AREA ON THE BALL WHICH CAN HELP YOU TO GUIDE THE BALL TO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE COURT
SO WHAT DOES GOBLIN HERE IS GOING TO DO IS GOING TO STEP FORWARD AND THE CORE IS GOING TO BASICALLY HIT A CROSS COURT STEPPING TOWARDS THAT DIRECTION WITH HIS LEFT FOOT
IT'S NOT ADMISSIBLE IN COURT SO YOU KNOW DON'T GO HOME AND TEST YOUR KIDS AND BE THEM IF IT DOESN'T TURN OUR <UNK>
SO A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PRACTICE ON THEIR WOBST SO DOING THIS VERSION OF THE BOAST DRIVE DRILL TO THE DRIVE WE'RE GOING TO HIT A BOAST CROSS COURT TO HIT A WALL
THE SOLES ON THE SHOES CAN YOU CAN ADD LEAVE SCARFS ON A TENNIS COURT WHICH TEND TO RUIN THE CORE LITTLE BIT FASTER
IT'S REALLY MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN YOU'RE USING IT ON THE SIDE OF THE COURT
AND THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A GOOD AS STRATEGY IS TO SHOOT TWENTY FIFTY A HUNDRED TO ONE AND SHOTS FROM THIS SIDE I USE IN THE BACK COURT UNTIL YOU GET LOST IT
THIS IS GOING TO ACTUALLY LINE IT UP FOR ALL YOUR CUPS MAKE A HALF COURT LINE JUST LIKE I WAS TELLING YOU BEFORE
SO I'M GOING TO JUST TAKE THIS AND MOVE THE ROOT UP TO THE TOP OF THE COURT
YOU CAN ALWAYS PLAY TENNIS ON THE SIDE OF THE WALL OR BACKWARDS SO THE TENNIS COURT IS DEFINITELY OPTIONAL WHEN IT WHEN IT'S COMING TO PLAYING TENNIS
SO IF MY TEAM SERVES A BALL BUT AT THE OTHER TEAM GETS THE BALL AND IT PUTS IT INTO OUR SIDE OF THE COURT AND THEY GET THE POINT EVEN THOUGH THAT INSERT THE BALL AND VICE VERSA
BE SURE WIND BEFORE MAKING UP BEFORE GETTING READY TO MAKE SUCH A PURCHASE TO REALLY DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE GETTING A TOP FOLD THE COURT AND THIS IS HOW TO BUY A COIN FOR CHORDS RESPOND
YOU'RE GOING UP AND DOWN THE COURT
SO THAT'S A WALL BOAST DRILL AND IT WORKS ON YOUR CROSS COURT LOVE LIKE AN OLDER DRILL
WHAT TYPE OF SHOES IF YOU'RE WEARING COURT ROOM ATTIRE OR BUSINESS SUIT OF SOME SORT AND THE PANTS FIT LOOSELY A YOU COULD YOU KNOW ACTUALLY ATTACH THIS TO THE INSIDE OF YOUR YOUR ANKLE AND PUT YOUR HANDS OVER YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW
SAUCE FASTER TO COURT IS GOING TO BE HERE
THE FORWARD ACTUALLY SMALL FOR WILL HAVE THIS RESPONSIBILITY I HEAR ANYTHING BEYOND THAT POINT GUARDS REACH IS ON ON THIS SIDE OF THE COURT WILL BE THAT SMALL FORWARDS RESPONSIBILITY
