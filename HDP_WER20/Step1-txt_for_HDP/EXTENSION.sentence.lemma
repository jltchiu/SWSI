I LIKE TO USE SPURS IS AN EXTENSION OF MY LEG
YOU'RE NOT KICKING THE AIR OUT OF AND YOU'RE JUST USING THAT AS AN EXTENSION SO THEY CAN FEEL ALL OF YOUR CUES
I JUST SHOWED YOU HOW TO ANCHOR YOURSELF I COULD ANCHOR MYSELF HERE AND DO SOME KNEE LIDS EXTENSION STRAIGHT OUT TO THE SIDE
HELLO EVERYONE I'M DAVID RODRIQUEZ HORTICULTURIST WITH TEXAS <UNK> EXTENSION SERVICE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME GARDENING STEPS IN PREPARING YOUR VEGETABLE GARDEN FOR THE SPRING PLANTING
ARMS IN FOR EXTENSION WITH WEIGHTS
THIS CLIP IS GOING TO BE A TRICEP EXTENSION
WHAT I'LL BE PERFORMING HERE IS THE OVERHEAD TRICEP DUMBBELL EXTENSION
ALL THAT LONG HAIR IT'S ALL FUSION HAIR EXTENSION
SO I GOT A NEWS ANY TWELVE MILLIMETER WITH AN EXTENSION AND A WRENCH AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE THIS OFF
AND ONCE YOU FINISH YOUR CLASSES YOU GET CERTIFIED AND THEN YOU CAN REPRESENTS THE WASH MISTING UNIVERSITY MASTER GARDENING PROGRAM AT DIFFERENT FARMERS MARKET SEND IN THE EXTENSION SERVICE OFFICES
SO THE MAIN REASON THAT THESE ARE THE WHOLE PROGRAM IN WASHED AND STATE WAS SO THAT THE EXTENSION SERVICE THE DEPARTMENT OF THAT CAN HELP HELP BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE CALL HIM WITH GARDENING QUESTIONS
SO YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IT AS THOUGH IT'S A ROMANIAN DEAD LIFT OR IT'S A BACK HYPER EXTENSION
INHALE ON EXTENSION
AND WHEN I PUSH STRAIGHT OUT GET FULL EXTENSION OF MY HANDS AND ELBOWS AND WHEN I CATCH IT WILL LOOK INTO BOTH HANDS BRING INTO MY CHEST AND THEN STRAIGHT OUT AGAIN
AND THAT'S THE OVERHEAD TRICEP EXTENSION
AND IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A CHAIN LEAD ROPE AND AN EXTENSION CORD ON
SO THE WASHINGTON STAY PROGRAM IS RUN THROUGH THE WASHED IN STATE UNIVERSITY CO-OPERATIVE EXTENSION
SO THE MASTER GARDENING PROGRAM IS SPONSORED BY YOUR LOCAL STATE EXTENSION SERVICE
AND AS YOU'RE WORKING IN MOBILITY IN ONE PLANE OF MOTION THAT WAY YOU'RE GETTING EXTENSION IN THAT PLANE OF MOTION AS WELL FOR SEATED TWIST DURING YOUR COOL DOWN
AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO FOLLOW THIS UP WITH EXTENSION ON YOUR COOL DOWN BECAUSE HAVING YOUR HANDS FOLDED AND TURNING LATERALLY IS GOING TO CREATE A CONTRACTIONS SO YOU WANT TO RELEASE THAT CONTRACTION
SO WE'RE GOING TO LOOK OVER AND WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW YOUR HANDS WITH AN EXHALE CENTER INHALE AND FOLLOW YOUR ARMS LOOK AT YOUR ELBOW OR YOUR FINGERS WHERE IT'S EVER EXTENSION YOU CAN GET WORKING WITH AN ACTIVE RANGE OF MOTION
RIGHT NOW IS REALLY GOOD OKAY NICE AND HIGH OFF THE BOARD YOU DID SEE A REALLY NICE TIGHT SPIN OKAY YOU SONG POINT PRIDE AND SEE HIM BUT IN THE AIR HE WAS LOOKING FOR THE WATER TO SPOT KICKED OUT NICE AND STRONG GOT GOOD EXTENSION BABY FOR THIS STRETCH THOSE ARMS A LITTLE MORE BUT THAT WAS REALLY GOOD REVERSE ONE HALF TIME
FILES WITH THE EXTENSION OF OUR A CAR OR COMPRESSED FILES THAT ARE NORMALLY CREATED AND LINUX SYSTEMS
ONE OTHER ONE IS COMING OVER THE INSIDE OF THE BATON IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND RUN A TWO IS RECEIVING AND IT'S LESS FAT SO HE WANTS TO BE TWENTY METERS WITHIN THE EXCHANGE ON BEFORE AND AFTER TO EXTEND TO MAKE SURE WE WANT IT TO GET A FULL EXTENSION OF THE BATON PASS
WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS IT'S ALL ABOUT FLEXION EXTENSION OF OUR KNEES AND BY THAT I MEAN WE USE OUR KNEES LIKE A OUR KNEES ARE JOINT
THESE ARE BASICALLY JUST AN EXTENSION OF YOUR OWN WAY OKAY
