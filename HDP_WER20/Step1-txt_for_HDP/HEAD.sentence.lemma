THE NEXT CLIP WE'LL TALK ABOUT A CREATING A HEAD ARE TO AMPLE INTO FLASH
BALL COMES OUT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEY DON'T GET THE FILE CALLED BECAUSE THE THE THE PLAYER THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO BOX OUT IS EASILY ABLE TO GET THE REBOUND
SO IT'S OVER THEIR HEAD IT CAN BE DOUBLE OVERHEAD SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY TO DESCRIBE IT
AND COME UP ONTO THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD
NOW LIFT THE HEAD NECK AND SHOULDERS OFF THE FLOOR AND BRING THE HANDS UP AS WELL
SO AS THIS HAND COMES OUT FROM THIS POSITION THE HANDS GO OPEN HEAD TURNS FORWARD AND PALMS ARE UP
NOW AS THIS POINT OUR LEFT HAND OPENS AND COMES OVER HEAD PALM BLOCK AND NOW SHE'S GOING TO TURN HER TORSO THIS WAY USING THE HAND
WE'RE GOING TO HEAD IT'S POPULARITY IN THE LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS EARLY NINETEEN NINETEEN TWENTIES AND PEOPLE LOVE TO COLLECT RUBY ON WHETHER THIS I FEEL HAS A LOT MORE ROOM IN VALUE OF SO YOU'RE PAINTING ON A FAIRLY REASONABLE PRICE AND DOWN THE ROAD HOPEFULLY YOUR VALUING THREE

AND THEN RELEASE TO THE FLOOR AND TURN THE HEAD TO ONE SIDE AGAIN RESTING
INHALE BREATHE IN FROM THE TAIL BONE ALL THE WAY UP TO THE CROWN OF THE HEAD AND AS YOU BREATHE OUT DROP DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE INTO THE STRETCH
FROM THIS POSITION EVERY TIME YOU TAKE A BREATH IN AND REMEMBER THAT THREE PART BREATH BREATHING FROM THE BELLY ALL THE WAY UP TO THE COLLAR BONES ON THE INHALE THAT'S GOING TO LENGTHEN YOU FROM THE TAIL BONE ALL THE WAY UP TO THE CROWN OF THE HEAD
OKAY NOW THAT WE HAVE THE HEAD STITCHED AROUND IN THE SHOULDERS WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PUT IN OUR ARMS WE ALREADY HAVE ALREADY IN STUFFED
SO SEE IF YOU CAN LET THE TAIL BONE DROP REACH TO THE CROWN OF THE HEAD ROLL THE SHOULDERS OPEN AND BACK AND THE FEET PRESS INTO THE FLOOR
IF IT FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE HOLD ON TO THE EDGES OF THE CHAIR THAT'S FINE OR YOU CAN RELAX THE HANDS ON THE THIGHS AND CLOSE THE EYES AND JUST PICTURE STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY AND JUST ROLL THE SHOULDERS OPEN REACH TO THE CROWN OF THE HEAD AND REMEMBER YOUR THREE PART BREATH FROM THE BELLY THROUGH THE RIBS UP TO THE TOP SALONS
ONCE YOU MADE THAT CIRCLE AT THE TOP YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A SMALLER HALF CIRCLE AND THAT IS GOING TO BE THE HEAD OF YOUR LADYBUG
AND NUMBER SEVEN IF YOU TURN IT OVER BEFORE THAT CLUB HEAD HITS THE BALL YOU'RE GOING TO HOOK
SO SOME VARIATIONS ART YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOU HAD A CRESCENT KICK WITH THE KICK COMES OUT AND IT COMES OUT SLAPPING ON THE SIDE SIDE OF THE HEAD
RIGHT NOW IS THE HORSE HAS ITS HEAD TURN TO OUR
IF THE WIDER WALKS UP QUIETLY AND SLOWLY TOWARDS THE HORSE'S HEAD AND THEN PUTS THAT SECRET ROPE FROM AROUND YOUR WAIST AROUND THE HORSE'S NECK IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE MADE A CLEAN CATCH
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INTERMEDIATE FLOOR GYMNASTICS AND WE'VE COVERED ARE STRETCHING IN OUR WARM UPS TO AVOID INJURY AND THE NEXT THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WAS WAS YOUR YOUR BODY POSITIONS ARM MAINLY YOUR HEAD POSITION
YOUR HEAD ARM IS REALLY THE KEY TO WHERE THE REST OF YOUR BODY IS GOING
WHATEVER YOUR HEAD IS DOING REALLY DETERMINES WHAT THE REST OF YOUR BODY WILL BE DOING
SO I JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU SOME OF THE BASIC SKILLS AND WHERE YOUR HEAD POSITION IS ON THOSE SCALES
SO BASICALLY WE'RE GOING TO LAY FLAT ONCE AGAIN OUR HANDS ARE BEHIND HER HEAD ELBOWS BACK CHIN IS UP
SOCCER KICK THE HEAD BUT STILL THAT ARM LIKE YOU DO A KNEELING THAT ARM LIKE RIGHT THERE IS A GOOD ONE
AND SO JUST KEEP GOING UNTIL THE PREVIOUS ONE HEAD THAT CLOSED UP
AND WHEN I'M DONE WITH THAT SIDE ALL STAY THERE FOR A COUPLE MINUTES BUT WHEN I'M DONE I'LL LET GO RELEASE MY HEAD UP MY ARM OUT AROUND TO COMING BACK DOWN
ALSO IF YOU'RE IN THIS CLOSE SO THAT THE MY DOING OUR REGULAR MORE PRACTICAL SPINE THEY MAY LET YOU USE ELBOWS CONTROLLED THOUGH YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO HIT ELBOWS TO THE HEAD YOU KNEE YOU CAN TAKE OUT LOW
ALL THE WAY UP DROPPING MY SHOULDER UNTIL I GET TO MY EAR AND THEN I'M GOING TO GENTLY REST MY HEAD ON MY SHOULDER THERE AND JUST GIVE A LITTLE TUG ON MY EAR TOWARDS THE GROUND
THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT WITH IT AS YOU'RE TRYING TO MOVE ALONG THE HEAD
DON'T HAVE BODY TAKE THE HANDS UP INTO THE HAMMER ASSESS THE HEAD TO THE BAND
AND ULTIMATELY JUST WANT TO LET THE HEAD RELAX IT AND LET THE BODY RELAX AH AT AND LET THE PRESSURE SO GOOD
AND THAT'S IT AND THEN WE'LL NEXT SEGMENT WE'LL BE WORKING ON THE HEAD NECK AND SHOULDER AREA
AND AS YOU CAN SEE KYLE'S CHISELED IT FORWARD SO NOW IT'S GOING TO PUT HIS HEAD BACK A LITTLE BIT MORE IN A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT
SUPPORTING THE HEAD WITH YOUR SHOULDER AND THEN ASK HIM ALSO TO PUT THEIR BELLY BUTTON UP IN THE SKY
REALLY HARD TO GET THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR RACKET HEAD IS COMING AROUND EFFICIENTLY NOTICE THE EXPENSE OR YOUR CLASS OR WHATEVER YOU MIGHT USE

IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO SLIDE HEAD FIRST
AND NOW WE'LL DO THE HEAD
YOU HOLD THE KITTY'S HEAD THIS WAY AND HE'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO TURN AROUND AND BITE YOU
SO WHAT I DO SUGGEST IS THAT WITH THIS THERE'S FOUR SCREWS USE YOUR PHILLIPS HEAD SCREWDRIVER AND SIMPLY REMOVE THAT FROM THE DOOR
AND WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS GET A TEMPLE IN YOUR HEAD AS EVEN AS POSSIBLE ONE TWO AND JUST PLAY EVERY STRING AND KEEP ALTERNATING YOUR FINGERS AND WORK ON GETTING A NICE BIG SOUND ON YOUR BASE
THE TARGET AREA IS FROM THE WAIST UP INCLUDING THE HEAD AND TO SCORE AS I SAID YOU MAKE CUTS TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF YOUR OPPONENT'S TARGET OKAY
SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS PUT IT UP TO THE NEAREST LEGAL LIMIT THAT YOU CAN WHICH IS RIGHT UP ON THAT HEAD STRING AS SO
THIS IS YOUR STANDARD FULL FACE HELMET IT IS SNELL APPROVED IT IS A COMPOSITE BLEND IT HAS A WONDERFUL VENTILATION SYSTEM IS VERY LIGHT IN WEIGHT AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT COVERS THE WHOLE HEAD
AND IT IS NOT SMELL APPROVED AND IT ONLY COVERS THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD
TIGHTEN THIS UP TO A GOOD TORQUE I'M GOING TO TIGHTEN UP THE OTHER HEAD SO NOW I HAVE MY GRIPS INSTALL AND I'M READY TO SET UP MY BRAKE LEVER
THEN YOU WANT TO HAVE WHAT'S CALLED THE HAIR LIGHT IT WILL BE AND AT THE BACK OF THE MODELS HEAD SO THAT THEY'RE HAIR STANDS OUT FROM THE BACKGROUND AND SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THE DEPTH OF THEIR HEAD ACTUALLY
SO NOW I'M GOING TO TAKE MY LEFT THUMB RIGHT THUMB AND PRESS IT AGAINST THE WHEEL HEAD AND MOVE IT TOWARDS THE CLAY TO GIVE MYSELF A UNDERCUT
PLACE MY COMB IN THE SIDE OF THE HEAD OR THE SIDE BACK OF THE HEAD AND SEE WHERE THE COMB STARTS TO COME OFF OF THE HEAD FORM
HALF OF THE HEAD BACK O.K
MAKE THE HEAD AND THEN A STRAIGHT LINE FOR THE ARM AND COME BACK TO THE EDGE AND THEN MAKE A LITTLE CURVE FOR A SKIRT AND COME BACK DOWN
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO A FULL SQUAT SQUATTING ALL THE WAY DOWN THEN YOU'RE GOING TO PRESS STRAIGHT ABOVE YOUR HEAD THEN STAND UP WITH THE STRAIGHT ON
MAKE SURE YOU STAY IN THE CENTER GRINDING THE WHEEL HEAD WHEN THOSE TWO WAYS TO GET IT ON THE NOSE
DO YOUR HEAD JUST KNEE TRIMMING
OKAY IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO COVER REMOVING THE DRIVER SIDE SEATBELT FASTENERS AND BASICALLY THERE FASTEN WITH TWO BOLTS AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE A SEVENTEEN MILLIMETER HEAD
SO IF THE EIGHTH OF SMASH STRAIGHT OVER HEAD THIS WAY OKAY IF YOU BLOCK STRAIGHT LIKE THIS AND YOU DON'T HAVE A VERY STRONG GRIP IT'LL PRESS STRAIGHT DOWN AND SMASH YOUR OWN WEAPON IN YOU PLUS THE IRS
NOW WHEN YOU FINISH A HAIRSTYLE IS GREAT TO JUST TAKE THIS BRAID AND SPRAY IT OVER THE ENTIRE HEAD JUST AGAIN MAKE SURE ALL THE LITTLE STRAY HAIRS STAY BACK
ELBOW BENDS TO HEAD TURNS TO ME
SO WE HAVE SOME FUN LITTLE PARTY HATS AND NEXT HEAD WHERE
AND YOU'RE GOING TO SLOWLY EXHALE KEEPING YOUR HEAD BACK AND YOU'RE GOING TO BEND PRIMARILY AT THE WAIST TAKEN THE WEIGHT DOWN TOWARD YOUR SHINS
SO YOU WANT TO CREATE AS MUCH CLUB HEAD SPEED ON FOR THOSE HIGH HANDICAP PLAYERS WHO HAVE TROUBLE GET THE BALL UP IN THE AIR
SO FIRST THING IF I PUT THE KAYAK BLADE ON TOP OF MY HEAD AND I JUST ROTATE LIKE THIS SEE HOW I'M ACTUALLY USING MY STOMACH MUSCLES TO BRING THE BLADE BACK AND FORTH
THAT WAY YOUR BODY GETS A NICE FULL MUSCLES THERE'S BLOOD GOING TO EVERY PART OF MUSCLE FROM YOUR HEAD GOING DOWN AND THEN YOU PREVENT A LOT OF INJURIES FROM HAPPENING
AS YOU LEAN AWAY YOU WANT TO TURN VERY SLIGHTLY KEEPING THE HEAD IN A STRAIGHT LINE WITH YOUR FRONT SHOULDER

AND WHEN YOU CLOSE THE EYES LET THE EYELIDS BE HEAVY LET THE BOTTOM LEG NEAT THE UPPER LID AND LET THE EYES ROLL BACK AND THE HEAD AND FIND THAT NICE PEACEFUL TRANQUIL FEELING OF BEING RELAXED
YOU'RE GOING TO DROP THE BALL SLIGHTLY BUT ON THE HEAD TO ABOUT NINETY DEGREES AND EXTEND UP
AND IF YOU USUALLY HAVE SOMETHING AND YOUR HEAD SO THAT YOUR CHIN STARTS IN A CHIN TUCKED POSITION GO AHEAD AND REMOVE THAT NOW
THING YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS THE LITTLE BELOW SHOWER HEAD
I MEAN THAT YOU NOT SEWING YOU KNOW THE FACE TO TOO MUCH TO THE SIDE OF THE HEAD
REMEMBER THAT EVEN IN THIS POSITION RIGHT WANT TO FEEL THE SHOULDER BACK THE SHOULDER FORWARD HEAD PRESSING UP
WHILE YOU'RE DOING THIS IT'S KIND OF A TRICKY PROCESS BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO UP YOU NEED TO LOOK FOR THE COPING WITH YOUR HEAD TURNS
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GRAB THE BASE OF THE BODY IN THE PANTS TOGETHER AS WELL AS THE BACK OF THE NECK OF YOUR SCARECROW AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO PUT THEM IN YOUR CHAIR AND SLIDE DOWN AND IF YOU HAVEN'T STUFF PROPERLY HE'S GOING TO STAND UP ON AS WELL AND YOU HAVE YOUR HEAD PIN DOWN SECURELY THAT'S GOING TO STAND UP AS WELL

SO WHEN YOU TAKE THOSE INFLECTION WAY TO GET THEM OUT OF HER HEAD AND REALIZE THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING
I'M GOING TO BE USING THAT FOR THE EYE SO YOU WANT TO GET IT AS SMALL AS YOU CAN BECAUSE THE FLAMINGOS HEAD IS SO SMALL
SO LIFTING UP THROUGH THE BACK LIFTING THE CROWN OF THE HEAD NICE AND HIGH AND BREATHING
YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STICK WITH YOUR ARMS VERY EFFECTIVE WAY BUT I DO HAVE MY HEAD I HAD IN MY KNEES AVAILABLE SO GET MY HEAD BUT TO SOFTEN OFF
ONE SEVERAL MAJOR AWARDS FOR MY WORK WHICH ENABLE BE TO GET A JOB AS THE HEAD OF A DOCUMENTARY FILM UNIT FOR BELL HELICOPTER INTERNATIONAL AND TO RUN AROUND
THIS IS HOW TO DO THE G TURN ONCE YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH SPEED COMING DOWN THE BORDER SLOW TO MEDIUM PACE YOU WANT TO HEAD UP THE RAMP
NOW THE FIRST COUPLE TIMES YOU PUT ON FOR TAKE OFF YOUR WINTER HORSE BLANKET THIS IS RUDY HERE AND HE'S ALWAYS GOOD TO STAND THAT YOUR HORSE PROBABLY WON'T BE AS GOOD PIKE IN A FRIGHTEN AND JUST A LITTLE BIT WHEN SOMETHING GOES ON OVER THEIR EYES AND OVER THEIR HEAD

SO YOU WANT TO BE THE FIRST TO GET UNDER AND HEAD UP AND YOU WANT IT TO GO HOPEFULLY THEIR TOWARDS A TEAMMATE AND YOU ALSO WANT TO BE READY THAT IF YOU CAN INTO SNAG IT
THE OPEN IMPORTANT THING WITH THE OVERHEAD PASS IS YOU WANT TO IT IT'S EXACTLY LIKE THE PASS IS CALLED YOU WANT TO COME OVER THE HEAD
SO WHEN YOU COME TO YOU WANT TO COME OVER THE HEAD COME DOWN STEP INTO THE PASS AND YOU SEE HOW MY HANDS ARE FACING MY ME
SO YOU COME OVER THE HEAD AND WHEN YOU PASS IT JUST AS ANY OTHER PASS YOU WANT TO STEP INTO THE PASS
SO JUST A COUPLE THINGS YOU NEED TO REMEMBER MAKE SHORT A HEAD FIRST ENTRY YOUR SHOULDERS THEIR HANDS OR ABOVE YOUR SHOULDER MAKES YOUR HANDS TOUCH FIRST IN THE FIRST MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FEET TOUCH FIRST DON'T TWIST YOUR BODY
THIS ONE BECAUSE THIS IS MORE MUSCLE YOU GOT TO TRY TO CONTINUE WORKING OUT THE HEAD AND ALL THE QUICK AS POSSIBLE ALL A LESS REST
SO WHAT I DO IS A LITTLE TIME TURN TO THE MOVEMENT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE A LITTLE MORE QUICKLY IN A WAY TO WORK WITH A LOT OF THE REST OF YOUR HEAD TO THE RECIPE TO MAKE A CUTE LITTLE PIN IT OUT
I'M LAURA GIBSON BEAUTY EXPERT AND I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT HEAD CURLING IRONS

AND THE HEAT COORDINATES WITH THE SHOULDER MOVEMENTS AND THE HEAD AND THE EYES
THE OTHER MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF SAFETY GEAR FOR WHITEWATER CANOEING IS A HELMET AND IF YOU HAVE A GOOD HELMET THAT FITS YOUR HEAD WELL AND IT WILL STAY ON WELL AND IT WILL PROTECT YOUR HEAD FROM THOSE OCCASIONAL BUMPS ON ROCKS WHEN YOU FLIP OUT OF YOUR BOAT OR EVEN FROM YOUR TEA GRIP IF IT HAPPENS TO AIRLIE HIT IN THE HEAD WHICH THEY DO OCCASIONALLY DO
THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF HELMETS THIS ONE'S FOR PEOPLE WITH A MORE ROUND HEAD THIS ONE GIVES YOU A LITTLE MORE PROTECTION IT HAS SOME YOUR FLAPS AND IS PRETTY TOUGH
DAD IF YOU WOULD DONE YOU'RE SHARE I WOULD BE FREEZING FROM HEAD TO TOE
YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR HEAD MIES PERFECTLY A RACK AND BRING THE SHOTGUN TO THE WAY THROUGH THE FACE
SO I LIKE TO MOVE THE HEAD A LITTLE BIT WHILE THEY'RE MOVING TO THE SIDE
FOR BARREL RACING WHAT WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS MOVE THEM THE HEAD AND TO THE SIDE OF THE SAME TIME
THEY'RE TERRITORY GENERALLY ONLY COVERS A SMALL AREA FOR EXAMPLE OF A SMALL CORAL HEAD IN THE SAND BUT THEY WILL ATTACK ANYTHING THAT GETS TOO CLOSE TO IT INCLUDING FISH MUCH LARGER THAN ITSELF
TO GET OUT OF THIS BRING THE WEIGHTS DOWN DROP THE HIPS LIFT THE HEAD AND WALK YOURSELF BACK UP ON THE BALL
A HORSE THAT GETS US TO THIS NOSE IT'S THERE AND BAILEY WILL JUST KIND OF RUNNING KEEP HIS HEAD A LITTLE LOWER IT
THE REASON WHY IS IT GOES OVER THEIR HEAD BEHIND THEIR EARS AND OVER THEIR EYES
AND WHAT THAT DOES IS WHEN THE ELEVATE THEIR HEAD IT PUTS PRESSURE ON IT AND BRINGS IT BACK DOWN
ON THE NEXT THING WE'RE GOING TO INHALE AND LENGTHEN WE'RE GOING TO SLIDE OUR ARMS DOWN THAT TRUST ISSUE GRABBING ONTO YOUR PARTNER'S UPPER ARMS LIFT YOUR CHEST DROP YOUR HEAD BACK AND FLOWER YOUR LINEN OPEN YOUR POEM
THEY ARE VERY VERY LONG WHITE HERE AN OLDER DOGS YOU'LL SEE VERY OFTEN THAT YOU KNOW WHAT RIPPED UP HERE AT THE TOP HALF OF THEIR OF THEIR HEAD TO KEEP THEIR EAR OFF THEIR EYES
NOW ANOTHER ABOUT THE LANDING IS A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO LEAVE THEIR HANDS BEHIND THE HEAD AND PUSH UP
AGAIN WITH THE BOAT DO ALL THE WORK THAT YOUR KNEES BEND YOUR ELBOWS RIDE IN AND OUT HEAD LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD
AND AS THEY DO YOU LET THEM RELAX AND IS ONCE YOU FEEL TENSION LINE UP UNDERNEATH AND LET THAT PERSON RELAX AND YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE YOUR HEAD BACK INTO POSITION OR MAINTAIN THAT SAME PRESSURE IN THAT SAME SPOT AS YOU HOLD THAT HEAD UP
I'LL HOLD YOUR HEAD UP
LIKE THAT IS OUR RED OUR OVER THE HEAD THAT OUR OF THE TIGER AND SO ON
THIS CAR HAS A LOT MORE POWER INTO HOW TO TEACH YOU HOW I WAS JUST IN A BUT IT IS A FULL DRIVE SO YOU CAN STEER THE WRIST WITH THE HEAD AND YOU CAN OR THROTTLE IN THE CAR WILL JUST SORT OF EVERYTHING OUT FOR YOU
AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO THE COVERING A FLIP YOUR HEAD OVER FORMING PLIE
THERE ARE AND THIS IS ALL OVER THE HEAD AND SO I GET THAT NICE IT AWAY
AND JUST THAN THIS TO ALL THE WAY THROUGH YOUR HEAD
YOU CAN ALSO HAVE PUT YOUR HEAD FLIP BACK ON THE CHAIR THAT'S EASIER FOR YOU
JUST TURN YOUR HEAD AND JUST MOVE
BECAUSE THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO LEARN IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT BECAUSE IT'S ALL LIKE YOU'VE GOT ACCOUNTING YOUR HEAD
YEAH SO I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU FROM A STANDING POSITION ARMS ABOVE MY HEAD
SHE'S GOING TO LIFT THE WAY UP ON HER TOES AND BRING HER WEIGHT FORWARD CROWN OF THE HEAD FORWARD AND THEN BRING THIS STRAP RIGHT UNDERNEATH AND IT RIGHT ALONG THE BRA LINE
BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FULLY HEAD YOU KNOW WHAT THE EVERYTHING HAS BEEN COVER
I LIKE TO USE A LITTLE WARM WATER THIS NICE ON THE HANDS AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED NOW WE'RE READY TO MOVE THE CLAY ONTO THE WHEEL HEAD AND GET IT CENTERED UP
AND ACTUALLY CAME FROM THE THIS SAME TO THE SAME TYPE OF GEL FOOD COLORING AND WHAT I DID IS I I THOUGHT MY HEAD BLUE OLLIE ALL I HAVE IS IS VANILLA AND I WANT TO MAKE SOME CUTE PINK CHOCOLATE AND SO I PUT ALL MY CHOCOLATES IN THERE AND THEN COME DOWN HERE AND I'M GOING TO FILL UP THE REST OF THESE
WHEN THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING DOWN ON PAPER AND THERE'S NOTHING BUT YOUR IDEAS IN YOUR HEAD AND YOUR STARING AT THE PAGE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE YOUR IDEAS ARE REALITY OR MAYBE YOU JUST FEEL LIKE BUFFING AROUND AND YOU KNOW THE STITCHING SEEING WHAT IDEAS FLOW FROM THE TIP OF YOUR PEN ON THE PAGE
IF YOU LOSE YOUR BALANCE DURING ONE OF THESE CLIPS SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING TO YOURSELF IN YOUR HEAD
IF YOU JUST WANT TO STROKE IT OVER THE ENTIRE HEAD OF BRAIDS JUST TO GET IT TO GO DOWN IN THERE
IN THIS SEGMENT OF HOW TO CURE YOUR SLICE AND HIT A HOOK WE'RE GOING TO CONCERN OURSELVES WITH THE CLUB HEAD
BECAUSE IT'S THE CLUB HEAD THAT HITS THE BALL IN THE BALL KNOWS ALL IN THE ONLY THING THE BALL KNOWS IS IMPACT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THERE BUT IF YOU COULD WATCH THE CLUB HEAD AT HOME IN PRACTICE SWINGS IN YOUR BACKYARD
I'M WATCHING THE CLUB HEAD AND I KNOW WHAT I WANT THAT CLUB HEAD TO DO
BECAUSE IF THERE WAS A GLOBE DOWN HERE ON THE GROUND AND I WANTED TO SPIN THAT GLOW IF I TOOK THAT CLUB HEAD AND I'M JUST WATCHING THE CLUB THAT IF I BROUGHT THAT CLUB HEAD INSIDE AND SWUNG THAT CLUB HEAD OUT AND BEFORE I GOT TO THAT GLOBE I RELEASED OR TURNED IT OVER OR FLIP THAT OVER
SO AS A DRILL WATCH THE CLUB HEAD
YOU SHOULD ALSO FACTOR IN IN IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME YOU HAVE TO GO TO YOUR HOBBY AND DON'T GET IN OVER YOUR HEAD
GUYS YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR HELMET IS ON NICE AND SNUG THE FINGER TO UNDER HERE IS GREAT MUCH MORE NOT TO JUST COME UP YOUR HEAD IS GOOD BUT BACKWARDS INTO THE RIVER
FIRST THING YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR CRADLE IS GOING TO SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF YOUR HEAD
THIS PARTICULAR STYLE A SCARF IS REALLY LONG AND IT STRETCHES OUT QUITE A WAYS WHICH IS KNEE IF YOU WANT TO WRAP IT AROUND THE HEAD MULTIPLE TIMES IF YOU GOT SOME SORT OF MOISTURIZE YOU'RE WORKING WITH TWO REALLY SATURATE AND HOLD EVERYTHING IN
YOU CAN WRAP AROUND THE HEAD THE WHEN IT COMES TO THE COTTON SCARF YOU REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE IT STAYS VERY TIGHT BECAUSE IF IT GETS TO LOSE IT WILL WORK AGAIN SHOE AND JUST BE REALLY LOOSE AND RUBBING AGAINST YOUR BRAIDS CAUSING THEM TO FRIZZ UP AND COME APART OR A LOT FASTER
SO WE DROP OUR HANDS AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS FOLLOW THE UPPER HAND WITH OUR EYES AND ACTUALLY TURN OUR HEAD AND THE SAME DIRECTION
IN THIS CASE YOU SEE AS SHE'S MAKING HER ATTACK IT MAKES YOUR CUP AND A SKATE SAFELY AVOIDING THE HEAD
SO A REALLY GOOD STRETCH IS TO REACH YOUR HANDS UP WAY OVER YOUR HEAD AND TO JUST LEAN TO ONE SIDE
YOUR HELMET IS VERY IMPORTANT PROTECTS YOUR HEAD FROM ANYTHING THAT MAY GET IN THE WAY IT COULD BE YOUR OWN PADDLE AND IT HAS TO FIT PROPERLY SO RIGHT UNDER THE CHIN
MY HEAD SHOULD NOT GO IF I WERE AND SO I'M GOING TO MOVE
TAKE YOUR HEAD SET AND AS YOU CAN SEE THIS HAS FIVE FIVE HOLES IN IT AND THERE'S AN INPUT HERE FOR FIVE HAS FIVE PRONGS
YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR HEAD SET WHICH OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE GOING TO USE
WHAT WE'LL DO NOW IS BRING IT IN AND WE WANT TO CATCH IT RIGHT HERE ON IT WITH BETWEEN THE HEAD AND THE BODY WITH THE STAPLE
YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR YOUR HEAD ON STRAIGHT
KEEP YOUR BODY IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION SHOULDERS BACK HEAD UP BACK NICE AND STRAIGHT
MY NAME I'VE BEEN ON FIVE AND ON THIS KNEE SO ICE TO COVER MY HEAD AND COKE
AND I HAD TO COVER MY HEAD
PUTTING HIS ARM INTO THE HEAD IN SO YOU WANT TO GET ON A NICE LOOK
THE HEAD LINES ARE DIFFERENT THAN PICTURES WHILE MEAN PICTURES MAY HAVE TEXAS PART OF THEM BUT I MEAN THIS IS JUST THE WORDS THE WORDS HERE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART AND THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL TO KEEP IN MIND
EXTENDING HER TAIL BONE RIGHT DOWN INTO THE EARTH AND THEN LENGTHENING UP THROUGH THE CROWN OF THE HEAD INHALING IN AND THEN AS SHE EXHALES SHE ROTATES INTO THAT LENGTH JUST A LITTLE BIT DEEPER
THE WAY THAT I'LL TEST THAT RIGHT NOW IS BY TURNING ON THE GROUP HEAD AND LETTING WATER FLOW THROUGH HERE AND I TAKE MY THERMOMETER
NOW ONCE I REACH MY SIXTY REPETITIONS WHICH IS ABOUT THE TIME OF FATIGUE YOUR HEAD FAILURE AND I DROP THE WEIGHT YOU BRING THE WEIGHT DOWN ANOTHER FIVE POUNDS OF AND CONTINUE
AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO INHALE AND LENGTHEN REACH YOUR TAIL BONE BACK AS YOU REACH THE CROWN OF THE HEAD FORWARD AND THEN EXHALE TRYING TO SINK DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT DEEPER
EXTENDING WITH THE TOES AND AGAIN IF YOUR NECK BOTHERS YOU CAN BRING YOUR HEAD DOWN
BUT IT WON'T WORK IS DEEPER INTO THE BACK AND THE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES AS IT IS WHEN YOU LIFT THE HEAD UP
AND THE FACT THAT IN MANY CASES BIRDS ARE OVER YOUR HEAD
IF YOU DO ANY TYPE OF ENTRY AND ITS HEAD FIRST AND YOUR ARMS ARE BELOW YOUR SHOULDER LINE THEY'RE GOING TO DUMP POINTS
MY RIGHT HAND COMES OVER MY HEAD THIS WAY
AGAIN I MIGHT NEED TO FIND SOMETHING LIKE A BALL OR SOMETHING TO REALLY ENJOYS AND I WORK WITH TWO SO CHEESE WITH THIS TOY AND SHE'S HEAD IN A WAY FOR ME I'M GOING TO GO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WITH YET ANOTHER SQUEAKY TOY
SO WE LIKE TO ASK THEM TO DO IS WE LIKE TO ASK THEM TO PUT THEIR HEAD BACK LOOKING UP THIS GUY
YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO TRY TO KEEP A STRAIGHT LINE FROM THE CROWN OF YOUR HEAD THROUGH YOUR SITS BONES TO COME INTO TABLE TOP AND THE INK HOW HAPPENS WHEN YOU USE BEND THE SITS BONES UP TOWARD THE CEILING DROP THE BELLY AND GENTLY RAISE THE HEART
TAKE A BREATH PUT YOUR HEAD BACK IN THE WATER
SO START MOVING WITH YOUR HEAD TO THE SECOND FOR ALL INTO A NICE CATCH OKAY
SO IF YOU TOOK YOUR HEAD AND YOU JUST SLIGHTLY TURNED IT JUST ONE WAY I BREVE PUT IT BACK AND BREATHE
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE HEAD OF COURSE WHICH IS A WAY
IN THIS CASE EMMA BEGINS PREPARING HER ATTACK AND AS SHE DOES SHE IS HITTING THE HEAD
THE NINETY POUNDS OF PRESSURE WITH THE CHILD THAT CANNOT HOLDER HEAD UP YET
NOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I'M NOT SURE I WANT MY CHILD HEAD TO BE PULLED
THIS IS A GREAT POINT FOR TREATING OVERALL FOR THE WHOLE HEAD SO NO MATTER WHERE THE PAIN IS ORIGINATING JUST GIVING IT SOME LIGHT OR DEEP MASSAGE CAN BE VERY HELPFUL
THEN FOLLOWING UP WITH THIS OVER THE WHOLE HEAD
BASICALLY WHAT IT IS IS ARE HELD IN WITH A TEN MILLIMETER BOLT WITH THE SEVENTEEN MILLIMETER HEAD AND THEY HAVE THE WASHER ON A LOCK WASHER AND THEN SPACER BUSHING
AND WHEN YOU GO DOWN YOU HOLD THAT POSITION SO THE MUSCLES ARE LEARNING TO SUPPORT THE HEAD AND THE PROPER POSTURE FOR EVEN STANDING OR SITTING IN THE OFFICE
MANY INSTRUCTORS WILL SAY INHALE NOT YOUR HEAD AND EVERYONE IN THE CLASS CARS
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING WHEN YOU LOWER YOUR HEAD IN THIS WAY IS THAT YOU'RE LENGTHENING THE MUSCLES IN YOUR NECK RATHER THAN AND TEACHING YOUR HEAD HAVE FALL FORWARD RATHER THAN A INCREASING THE LENGTHEN YOUR SPINE
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE HEAD DOWN
I'M GOING TO KIND OF JUST JUST KIND OF MASSAGING THE HEAD OF THE BRUSH OR JUST THERE'S ANY LOOSE BRISTLES KIND OF PULL HIM OUT
OKAY THIS IS THE WAY ASSORTED PAIN KNUCKLE SORT HEAD PIN KNUCKLE HAND SHOULD LOOK OKAY
SO THAT'S FIRST AND AFTER YOU'VE WORKED FROM HEAD NECK TO SHOULDERS YOU'RE READY TO START INCORPORATED IN SOME OF THAT LOWER BODY ON THE OTHER HALF OF THAT CENTER GRAVITY
MAYBE IT'S TWO PLUS TWO EQUALS FOR NOW WE'RE HEAD TO THE DOOR
THESE UP TO THE HEAD THEM TO DIGEST YOUR FOOD AND THEY GIVE TO GIVE THEM SOME MINUTES SUPPLEMENTS
SOME PEOPLE IF THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE NECK BOTHERSOME CAN LAY THE HEAD DOWN
BUT IF YOU WANT TO CONNECT DEEPER INTO THE BACK KNEE ABDOMINAL HOLD YOUR HEAD UP
YOU CAN DO THIS WAY YOU KNOW SITTING DOWN OF THE HEAD WORKING A AT THE COMPUTER OR EVEN IF YOU'RE WATCHING TV YOU KNOW THESE ARE GOOD THINGS
ENERGY EXTENDS OUT THE CROWN OF THE HEAD AND IT'S WHITE LIGHT
AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PROCEED TO GO AROUND LIKE THIS HALF THE HEAD FROM THE EAR TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEAD THIS WAY
AND MAKE SURE YOU STAY CENTERED THUMB AS YOU GO ALONG THE HEAD WITH MORE BRAIDS IT JUST BECOMES THAT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO REMAIN CENTERED LIKE THIS
I'M GETTING READY TO HEAD OUT INTO THE WILDERNESS TO TEACH YOU HOW TO SURVIVE IN THE OUTDOORS
AND JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE ON THE HEAD THAT YOU WANT TO
SINCE I HAVE THESE TURNING BRAIDS RIGHT HERE WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO START TO BRAID AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEAD AND BRING IT AROUND JUST TO KIND OF FIT INTO THIS CORNER THAT I'VE CREATED
AND THE HEAD DISH IS THE INDIAN KARIE
SO BASICALLY YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KEEP THE SHOULDERS FROM COMING UP KEEP THAT LINE SHINING ON THE CROWN OF THE HEAD EXHALE INHALE DO WILL FEEL YOU'LL FEEL THEM ALL THE CROSS NOT ONLY THE SHOULDERS BUT ACROSS YOUR BACK
NOW ALSO THERE'S GOING TO BE A TENDENCY FOR THE SHOULDER TO COLLAPSE SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SHOULDER IS PULL BACK THAT THE CHEST IS OPEN THE HEAD IS GOING TO BE ALIGNED WITH THE REST OF THE SPINE
IT ALSO WORKS IF YOU HAVE A PERSON YOU'RE BEHIND HIM YOU WANT TO HAVE A NICE TIGHT GRIP OF THAT HEAD YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO PULL THE NECK BACK IN THE HEAD BACK SO WHEN YOU HIT YOUR HEAD OVER THE NOSE TO READ YOUR NOSE
THEN THERE ARE SOME POINTS PARTICULARLY IF THE MIGRAINE IT'S GOING TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD ABOVE THE EAR
LET OUT ANY TENSION IN THE HEAD
WE GO TO THE HEAD AND TREAT SOME LOCATIONS
AND YOU CAN HEAT UP LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE PORTER FILTER A LITTLE BIT FASTER BY FLOW AND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER THE PORTER FILTER OR AND THAT WILL GET IT UP TO THE SAME TEMPERATURE IS THE GROUP HEAD
AND OF COURSE WITH THAT YOU HAVE YOUR PORTER FILTER AND THIS IS THE GROUP HEAD
EGGS HATCH IN A FEW DAYS AND THE FRY DRIFT WITH THE CURRENT AND TELL A OR A LARGE ENOUGH TO TAKE UP RESIDENCE ON THEIR OWN CORAL HEAD
SO YOU ALWAYS COUNT EITHER ONE THREE FIVE OR SEVEN YOUR HEAD WHATEVER YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH BECAUSE EVERYONE'S LINES ARE DIFFERENTLY AND YOU'VE GOT A BUILD UP TOWARDS IT
AND WHEN YOU DO END UP PULLING FROM YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP FOR AIR AND THAT'S WHEN YOU'LL TAKE YOUR BREATH IF YOU NEED IT IT'S UP TO YOUR BUT YOU'LL TAKE YOUR BREATH FOR AIR AND THEN YOU PUT YOUR HEAD BACK IN THE WATER AND GO AGAIN
MAKE SURE NOT TO CUT THIS HEAD OFF
JUST KIND OF WORK YOUR THUMBS AROUND THE SIDE OF HER HEAD TO PULL A LITTLE BIT OF HAIR DOWN
BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER MOVE ON OVER HERE AND LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR HEAD OR BOARD
THEN A STRETCH YOUR LEFT ARM OVER YOUR HEAD AND DRAW THE LEFT SHOULDER BACK GOT THE RIGHT SHOULDER BACK AND OPEN UP THE POSE TURNING YOUR HEART TOWARD THE SKY
AS THE LEFT LEG BENDS DEEPLY TAKE THE FORM TO THE FIVE THE RIGHT HAND TO THE HIP KEEPING YOUR BREATH IN AND THEN SWEEP YOUR RIGHT ARM UP AND OVER YOUR HEAD
A DIFFERENT HEAD TOUCHES I MEAN BY HAIR THAT'S BEEN RELAXED AND IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF TEXTURE THIS STRAIGHT HAIR OR OUR CURLY
SO WE'LL DO IS WE'LL START BY DRAWING SO THE OUTLINE OF HIS HEAD AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO ACTUALLY IS I'M GOING TO KIND OF GIVE THIS GUY THE BODY A RIGHT NOW SERVICE BECAUSE IN MY MIND THE BEATLES A COLOR RHINOS OF THEIR LITTLE BUG COMMUNITY
IT'S PRETTY EASY TO GET YOUR HAND OVER YOUR HEAD AROUND
THEY HAVE A SLENDER ELONGATED HEAD WITH A VERY SMALL MILES
THESE ARE ALL THE TIME DO NOT COVER THE HOLES CIRCUMFERENCE OF YOUR FACE SO ALWAYS CONSIDER THAT YOU CANNOT WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU FALL
THINK OUT OF THE BOX AND NOT HEAD YOU'RE JUST YOUR NORMAL LIVING ROOM
THIS ONE HAS GOT A LOT OF FLUID HEAD BUT IT TRIES TO HAVE A FLUID HEAD
THE NEXT THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE PROPER HEAD ALIGNMENT WHEN YOU'RE LYING DOWN ON THE MAT
OKAY THIS DECK IS TWENTY YEARS OLD ITS HEAD A SOLID STAIN ON IT MANY TIMES WE'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE COLOR WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THIS BLACK WE'RE GOING TO REPLACE THE BOARDS THAT NEED TO BE REPLACED WHEN WE DO THAT WILL HAVE NEW WOOD
SO YOU'RE GOING TO BRING IT UP TO THE BASE OF THE HEAD AND BRING IT DOWN
SAME THING AS WE DID WITH THE TAIL DO A CLIENT FOLD WITH THE BASE OF THE HEAD SWIVEL FOLD ON BOTH SIDES
TURN YOUR UNIT TO THE OTHER SIDE AND WE ARE GOING TO DO A CRIMP FOLD WITH THE HEAD AS WELL SAME THING WITH THE TAIL
RELEASE THAT TOUCH THE FLOOR GUIDE THE FLOOR AWAY FROM YOU TAKE THE KNEES UP THE SIDE SO THAT SIT BACK TOWARDS THE HEELS FROM THE HEAD RIGHT DOWN ON YOUR FISH TO YOUR HUMANS GO FLAT ON THE MAT
YOU WANT TO GET YOUR BLOWPIPE ADJUSTED EITHER BY A SHORTER ONE OR A LONGER ONE OR THEY DO MAKE SOME ADJUSTABLE ONES BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE YOU KNOW COOK IN YOUR HEAD IN THERE TO GET TO THE BLOWPIPE OR YOU DON'T WANT TO WAIT BACK YOU KNOW A AGAINST IT
HOPEFULLY TEA THE HEAD UP A LITTLE BIT
IT RETURN HERE FOR CATCHING ON THE SIDE OF THE HEAD
SO HERE WE GO I CAME AROUND HERE THE BLADE DOWN SKI TO THE EYES STRIKING THE HEAD BACK DRIVING THE CENTER UP A LITTLE BIT
EVERY GOOD HEAD ON OR SHOULD HAVE HYDROGEN PEROXIDE CAT EITHER IN THE KITCHEN OR IN THE BATHROOM
THAT WAY BY THE TIME YOU HEAR THE WORD SECONDS OUT AND YOU ONLY HAVE TEN SECONDS LEFT YOU'VE ALREADY HAD A HEAD START YOU'VE ALREADY PUT YOUR MOUTHPIECE INTO THE BOXER YOU'VE ALREADY GOT HIM READY TO GO
ON AND THEN I'LL REACH UP AND AROUND WITH MY OTHER ARM TO MY OTHER EAR TO DROPPING MY HEAD
I'M USING THE WEIGHT OF MY ARM TO PULL MY HEAD DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND I'M GOING TO REACH OUT AT AN ANGLE WITH THAT OTHER ARM
TAKE SOME DEEP BREATHS AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE YOU RELEASE THE RIGHT ARM RELEASE THE LEFT ARM RELEASE THE HEAD AND JUST RELAX YOU SHOULD FEEL LIKE A LITTLE BIT TALLER
TO SET OUR BEVEL WE NEED TO TAKE AN ALLEN WRENCH AND LOOSEN THIS ALLEN HEAD SCREW IN THE BOTTOM
ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR DESIRED ANGLE SET YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TIGHTEN THAT ALLEN HEAD SCREW
YOU KEEP HIS HEAD BACK WHEN I'M AN EASY IS THE KIND OF MY BODY TO HELP PULL HIM ACROSS THE BALL OF THE CLOTHING BY ITSELF SO I
AND WITH JUST A STILL CAMERA UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO BE SHOOTING MOVIES THEN YOU REALLY DON'T NEED A FLUID HEAD
ALL THIS SIDE CINTHIE KEEP IT THERE TO DRAW THE HEAD BEND THAT ONE MORE TIME
JUST KIND OF AS A RECAP REMEMBER HOW IMPORTANT YOUR HEAD POSITION IS FOR EVERY SCALE
IF YOU'RE HAVING A HARD TIME I'M COMPLETING ONE OF YOUR TUMBLING PASS IS CORRECTLY REALLY GO BACK AND TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHERE YOUR HEAD IS GOING IN YOUR PASS AND YOU CAN WORK ON THAT IN YOUR MIND AND AND AND REALLY TRY IT AGAIN WITH THE PROPER HEAD POSITION
I KNOW IT'S CALLED THE BACK TUCK IT IN YOUR MIND NEED TO BE THINKING AND UP TUCK SO KEEPING YOUR HEAD LEVEL WATCHING SOMETHING IN FRONT OF YOU TO ENSURE THAT YOU'RE KEEPING YOUR HEAD WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE ENOUGH ROOM WITH THE NECKLINE FOR ALL THE CORNERS TO FALL SO THIS IS THE MORE NARROW PART OF THE HEAD
SO SET UP IN THE REGULAR NOLLIE POSITION YOU'RE GOING TO TURN YOUR BODY AND HEAD IN THE BLIND INSIDE POSITION OR BLINDSIDE DIRECTION
SWING YOUR ARMS JUST SLIGHTLY BY TURNING THEM AND HEAD IN THE BACK SIDE DIRECTION
I KNOW THAT I WAS IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT SEVERAL TIMES IN DURING THOSE TIMES I WAS UNDER TWENTY FOUR HOURS SURVEILLANCE WITH THE TWENTY FLOWER FLUORESCENT LIGHTS OVER MY HEAD ONE HOUR RECREATION PERIOD A WEEK AND THE OUT OF THAT RECREATION PERIOD PRETTY MUCH CONSISTED I'M GOING TO ROLL WHICH HAD NO RECREATION JUST A BIG TO WEIGH WINDOW WHERE PEOPLE WHILE PASS AND LOOK AT YOU AND THE HOLE
IT WAS JUST YOU KNOW SOMETHING YOU DID YOU HEAD AND NECK FOR INFINITY FOR IN PEOPLE IN YOUR NEIGHBOR MEAN YOU'RE COUNTING A WOODEN BRACCI THE ANIMALS
THAT'S THE OVER THE HEAD BLOCK IN STAFF
NOW TYPICALLY IN A HEAD SHOT SECTION LIKE THIS ALL SHOOT OFF TWO OR THREE STRINGS ON JUST TO JUST TO HELP GET THINGS ROLLING
NOW THE PROPER WAY TO DO EIGHT AN ABDOMINAL CRUNCH IS NOT LIFTING THE HEAD A ROLLING THE HEAD
SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS WHEN YOU'RE HAVING A BALL OF YOUR SIZE MAKING SURE THAT THE THIGHS ARE PARALLEL TO THE FLOOR YOU'RE GOING TO ROLL INTO IT UNTIL THE HEAD IS PARALLEL TO THE FLOOR SO YOU HAVE THAT SUPPORT IT'S LIKE A PILLOW UNDER YOU
SO WE CAN TURN IT OVER IF WE PRESS IT DOWN IT GIVES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A ROUNDED EFFECT ON THE TOP AND A FLATTER INSIDE WHICH WILL GO AGAINST THE UNDER BODY AND ALSO KEEP THE LENS HEAD IN TAIL ALL IN PLACE
EVERYONE HAS NOTICE HABIT SUCH AS PICKING IS NOSE IS DEAD SKIN TOUCHING NOSES HEAD OUT AND IS
YOU DON'T WANT TO PLACE A LOT OF WEIGHT ON YOUR HEAD SO YOUR HEAD IS BARELY TOUCHING
BRAIDING IT WITH A DAMP WHILE IT'S DAMP USE A LITTLE BIT OF MOVES AND THIS CAN ENHANCE YOUR WEIGHT AND GIVE YOU A BEAUTIFUL BED HEAD LOOK IN THE MORNING
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT CORKER PHOTOGRAPHY AND HEAD SHOTS AND WE'RE GOING TO SPECIAL OF SPECIALLY DISCUSS HOW TO WE LIGHT FOR PORTRAITURE AND HEAD SHOTS
BUT I LIKE TO SEE THE STUDENTS TO MAKE THE BASE OF THE BASE OF A TRIANGLE AND YOU WANT TO GET THE BALL RIGHT OVER YOUR HEAD THE APEX
MAKE SURE YOU DO THAT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T LOOK AT THE HEAD IF YOUR BODY IS NICE AND LOOSE KNEES YOUR HANDS TO STAND AT OKAY SO
HI I'M LES HEAD ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO GET YOUR BABY A BATH
KEEP YOUR ARMS ARE LEFT WITH JUST THE FLY UP OVER YOUR HEAD AND WHAT THEY LAND THIS TIME
AS THE HEAD START TO COME OUT THE DOCTOR NOW CAN GRAB A HOLD OF THE HEAD
FORM IS REALLY IMPORTANT ON THIS ONE SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR HEAD AND YOUR SHOULDERS ARE ON THE BALL
AND THEN YOUR HEAD YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO COUNT
SO REALLY IF YOU WANT TO LEARN IT THE BEST TRYING TO DO IT OUT OF THE WATER FIRST AND COUNT ON YOUR HEAD
WHEN YOU'RE DOING STRETCHES YOU NOT WORRY ABOUT WHETHER THE SHOULDERS REACH UP OR ANY KIND OF POSTURAL WHERE YOUR HEAD IS OTHER THAN TO MAKE SURE IT'S STILL SUPPORTED SO THAT IT'S NOT IN A AND EXTENDED POSITION
A REALLY GOOD ABDOMINAL STRETCHES TO BRING YOUR ARMS OVER YOUR HEAD GO AHEAD AND POINT YOUR FEET STRETCH YOUR ARMS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AND STRETCH YOUR FEET
THE FIRST THING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS PUT YOUR HAND OVER YOUR HEAD OR AT LEAST OVER YOUR HEART
WE'RE GOING TO INHALE AND LENGTHEN UP AND THEN AS WE EXHALE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT LENGTH FROM THE HIPS ALL THE WAY TO THE CROWN OF THE HEAD FORWARD
PRETTY MUCH YOU IS CALLED OVERHEAD CAUSE YOU BRING IT OVER YOUR HEAD
DRAPE A TOWEL OVER YOUR HEAD AND HOLD YOUR FACE OVER THE STEAM BEING CAREFUL NOT TO TOUCH THE POT
STICK IT ON THEIR HEAD
IF YOU'VE GONE OVER AND OVER IN YOUR HEAD WHAT'S GET WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO ALL THE WAY FROM YOUR BURN OUT TO YOUR STAGING YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN DO IT RIGHT IF YOU'VE DONE IT BEFORE AND YOU JUST REMEMBER AT THAT POINT THAT IF YOU LET YOURSELF TO IT THAT YOU'LL YOU'LL DO THE RIGHT THING
SO YOU CAN GET IN THE HEAD REALLY STRONG OR EVEN THEM THAT REALLY STOP
IN THIS SOME HEAD HERE BY HERE YOU'LL NOTICE THAT HER HAIR GOOD IT'S GOT THE WEIGHT AND IT'S STRAIGHT BUT SHE HAS LITTLE FIZZ AND IT IS DRY
SO IF YOUR WARM IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF RED IN YOUR HAIR FOR GRANDMOTHER WAS A RED HEAD YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO PUT RED ON YOUR HAIR
LET'S SAY YOU'RE DOING A FLIP AND YOU JUST HAPPEN THE SKIN THE WATER WITH YOUR FEET IT'S GOING TO BE CONSIDERED FAIL BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IT HEAD FIRST
SO IF YOU'RE DOING A HEAD FIRST ENTRY AND YOUR FEET TOUCH THE WATER
THE FIRST THING IS THIS IF YOU'RE DOING A HEAD FIRST ENTRY THAT MEANS THAT YOUR HANDS NEED TO HIT THE WATER FIRST OKAY
ALSO ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THE ARMS IN THE HEAD FIRST ENTRY IS THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABOVE THE SHOULDERS OKAY
FROM HERE TAKE A DEEP INHALE THROUGH THE NOSE START TO BRING YOUR CHIN TOWARDS YOUR CHEST AND CURL JUST THE HEAD NECK AND SHOULDERS UP AND HOLD IT THERE
IT'S THAT YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING THE EXACT SAME TIME THAT IS AN ILLEGAL HIT CAUGHT A DOUBLE HEAD
SO WHEN YOU'RE SETTING THE BALL TAKE THE BALL ABOVE YOUR HEAD WHERE AS IF YOU MISS THE BALL I WOULD HIT YOU IN YOUR FOREHEAD
BUT WE'RE COOLING DOWN HERE SO WE REALLY WANT TO RELAX HER SIT BONES INTO THE MAT MAINTAINING NEUTRAL POSTURE NEUTRAL PELVIS AND SPYING LIFTING UP THROUGH THE TOP OF THE HEAD
UNSCREW THE ENGINE PEROXIDE OR IN THE CAP POUR IT INTO YOUR DOG'S MOUTH OF THE MOUTH FOOT DOWN I THROW IT CLOSER MOUTH BETTER HEAD SO SHE HAS EVERYTHING IS OKAY
THE FIRST THING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS LEARN HOW TO FLOAT ON YOUR BACK BY SIMPLY PLACE IN YOUR HEAD BACK MIX IT UP IN THE AIR PUTTING YOUR BELLY BUTTON THAT AND JUST LETTING YOUR BODY FLOAT NATURALLY
NOW YOU HAVE THE OPTION PUTTING THE HAND BEHIND THE HEAD
THIS ONE'S MY PFD DESIGNED FOR SOME IN MY SIDE IT'S A STYLE THAT YOU PUT ON OVER IT OVER YOUR HEAD SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THE OTHERS
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE WHEN YOU PUT A PFD ON THAT IT FITS YOU AND IF SOMEBODY PULLS IT WAS YOU INTO A RAFT OR A CANOE THAT IT DOESN'T COME SLIDING UP OVER YOUR HEAD
THEY WOULD SLEEP WITH SOUP HANDS AROUND THEIR HEAD WITH THEIR HAIR TURNED OUT THAT WAY
I CAN REMOVE MY HAND FROM IS LOWER BACK AND THEN I CAN COME UP HERE AND FOCUS ON HIS HEAD
THEN YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND LET HIM KNOW AND ALWAYS COMMUNICATE WITH THE CHILD WHICH IS GOING TO DO NEXT LET HIM KNOW THAT YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND THAT'S GOING TO PUT IT BACK AND THAT YOU CAN REMOVE YOUR HAND FROM IS IS LOWER HEAD OR THE LOWER NET
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO A PLANT THAT END OF THE PADDLE IN THE WATER I'M GOING TO LOCK MIGHT PICK NECK IN MY HEAD ON MY SHOULDERS SO WHEN MY NECK MOVES TO WATCH THAT PADDLE BLADE MY WHOLE BODY IS GOING TO MOVE
SO THE HEAD IS RELAXED AND THE ARMPIT IS RELAX THE SPINE IS LONG MAKE SURE YOUR HIPS ARE STACKED AND HAVE IT
THE FUSION HAIR EXTENSIONS ARE THE PROCESS OF BONDING YOUR OWN HAIR TO APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE PIECES OF HUMAN HAIR CREATING ROWS THROUGHOUT YOUR HEAD TO CREATE A FOLDER AND THICKER LOOK
SO AGAIN OR ONE HALF ON THE TAKE OFF I WANT TO SEE HIM GET THE KNEES UP HIGH AND FAST OVER HIS HEAD
THE TILT YOUR HEAD THAT WAY
THINK OF PRESSING THE WEIGHT THROUGH YOUR BACK LITTLE TOE AND LET THE CROWN OF THE HEAD RISE
LIKE IN THIS ROOM WE'VE CLEARED OUT MOST EVERYTHING SO THAT IF YOU KNOW I FALL OR I SLIPPER TRIP I'M NOT GOING TO HIT MY HEAD ON A CORNER OF A COUCH OR YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO KNOCK A WHOLE BUNCH OF BOOKS OFF A SHELF OR ANYTHING EVERYTHING IS PRETTY PRETTY A CLEAR AND
JUST MAKE SMALL DOTS JUST JUST THIS BIG DOTS YOU WANT TO MOVE FARTHER AWAY FROM THE HEAD FROM YOUR SURFACE OF YOUR YOU'RE PAINTING OR YOU WANT TO GET AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE AND GET THAT REALLY FINE LINE
YOU JUST CAN BRING YOUR HAND DOWN BEHIND YOUR HEAD AND TO STRETCH OUT THE TRICEPS AND THAT'S GREAT TO DO
AND WHAT YOU RE DOWN THOSE ARMS COMING UP HEAD UP INTO THE CHEST NICE TOES UP OR ROLLED UP STRETCH FLOWERER AND COME UP AND YOU CAN DO IS THEY HAD THESE AS YOU LIGHT COMING BACK WHERE YOU CAN DO TWENTY TO FIFTY IF YOU WANT OR YOU CAN JUST RELAX AND GET TO THE FLOOR AND MOVE ON
IF YOU FIND THAT WHEN YOU'RE DOING A HIP ROLL THAT YOU'RE TAKING SOME TENSION IN YOUR NECK JUST GENTLY ROCK YOUR HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE
JUST REMIND YOUR HEAD THAT IT'S NOT ALL ATTACHED TO YOUR ABDOMINALS
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO MANIPULATE THE HEAD IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE YOUR THUMB BIRD IS IN ELEVATE THE HEAD SLIGHTLY
YOU'RE GOING TO ELEVATE THEIR HEAD AND YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE WHICHEVER HANDLE USE THE LEFT FOR RIGHT NOW
FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS OUR HEAD AND NECK WHICH IS THE BOOM
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS JUST WATCH WE'RE GOING TO START WITH HEAD AND NECK FROM HEAD AND NECK GOING TO MOVE DOWN TO A TORSO THE TORSO WE'RE GOING TO GO DOWN TO THE LEGS INTO OUR QUADS YOUR HAMSTRINGS
THEY HAVE A RELATIVELY SMALL TERRITORY THEY PATROL AND RARELY RISE MORE THAN A FEW INCHES ABOVE THE SAFETY OF THEIR PATCH REEF OR CORAL HEAD
SO THE PROCESS WAS I START AT THE DEFENSE AND HEAD AND BOX BLADE ON THE BACK OF MY TRACTOR AND PULL THAT AND TRY TO SMOOTH OUT AS MUCH AS I COULD BE AND I JUST TRY TO FOLLOW THE CONTOUR THE LAND
NOW BRING YOUR HEAD AROUND THE FRONT
AND I'M GOING TO BRING MY PADDLE TO THE SIDE I'M GOING TO TUCK FORWARD AND WHEN I'M TUCKED FORWARD MY HEAD IS PROTECTED WITH MY HELMET MY PFD PROJECTS MY BACK
THINK ABOUT THEM GETTING SUBMISSIVE WHEN WE WALK TOWARDS THE HEAD
NOW WE'LL DO THREE LITTLE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED THREE LITTLE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED WHAT THAT A LOT IN BULK THIS HEAD MAMA CALLED THE DOCTOR IN THE DOCTOR'S SAY NO MORE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED
TWO LITTLE MONKEY IS JUMPING ON THE BED THAT A LOT THEN DUMP THIS HEAD MAMA CALLED THE DOCTOR AND THE DOCK THEIR SAY NO MORE MARK KEYS JUMPING ON THE BED
OKAY ONE LITTLE MONKEY JUMPING ON THE BED JUST JUMP DOT THIN UP THIS HEAD MAMA CALLED THE DOCTOR IN THE DOCK THEIR SAY NO MORE MOM JUST JUMPING ON THE BED
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I WENT WITH EVEN THOUGH IS NOT TECHNICALLY HAIR IS A HEAD SCARF
SOME OTHER THINGS YOU CAN PRACTICE AND POOL SLIDING AND AND OPEN WATER SWIM EVERY SIX OR EIGHT STROKES YOU NEED TO CHOP THE STORES STROKE SHORT AND STICK YOUR HEAD UP
IN THE TOP OF THAT EXTENDING THROUGH THE CROWN OF THE HEAD WE HAVE THE CROWN
BUT I PERSONALLY THING BUT IF YOU CAN BUY SOMETHING FOR FIVE DOLLARS THAT THAT KEEPS YOUR BABY I'M HITTING THEIR HEAD ON SOMETHING GETTING STITCHES AND NOT TO ME IS MANY VERY WILL SPEND
THERE'S SOME KIND OF SHARP MIDDLE EDGES ON IT AND THEN JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN HE IS AN OLDER TODDLER THAT YOU NEED ON WHEN IT DOES HEAD AGAINST IT
IT'S JUST KIND OF KEEPS THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO BUMP THEIR HEAD ON THE OPPOSITE
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS DIRECTLY PUT THE MASK RIGHT ONTO HERE AND THEN OF COURSE THIS WILL GO AROUND THE CHILD'S HEAD AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO JUST GO AHEAD AND BREATHE IN IT AND IT
AND YOU DO THIS BOTH WITH YOUR HEAD COVERING AGAIN ON YOUR GLOVES
AND I FIND LITTLE KICK WITH THIS IS THAT'S THE CHILD WITH THEIR HEAD BACK ALL THE WAY BACK ON THE NEEDLE
FOR ONE TWO THREE KEEP YOUR HEAD BACK
AND HERE WE GO JUST BE NICE EASY KEEP THAT HEAD THAT ALL THE WAY BACK
HEAD BACK HEAD BACK WITH THAT HEAD BACKS ARE AT ALL THE WAY BACK
ONE THING YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS TRY NOT TO LEAVE THE MOVEMENT WITH THE HEAD BUT KEEP THE HEAD IN LINE WITH THE SPINE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE HEAD AND THE NEEDLE NOSE AND SOME OF THE NEEDLE NOSE TYPICALLY COME WITH A WIRE CUTTER AND THEN TWO
IT'S PULLING DOWN ONE TWO THREE FOUR PULL THE BACK OF MY HEAD DOWN GOOD
AND BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS ALL THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AS YOU DJ IS THE DJ'S BASICALLY ONE STEP THE HEAD OF THE CROWD AND BASICALLY IN THE HEAD PHOTOS CAMERA WRAP THE NEXT OUT BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY BRINGS IT IN AND TURNS THE VOLUME UP IN HERE
IT AND THEN IF THEY START TO YOUR RESPONDING AWAY LET'S NOW THEY'RE NOT ENJOYING IT THE WAY SHE COULD DID THIS NOW MANY LIFTED HIS HEAD AND KIND OF LOOK THAT MADE BACK OFF ON IT
SO A COUPLE KEY POINTERS REMEMBER YOU'VE GOT YOUR NINETY DEGREE ANGLE IS WITH YOUR LOWER BODIES YOUR SHOULDERS AND YOUR HEAD TO STAY ON THE BALL
WE DON'T WANT TO BE UP HERE WHERE YOUR LOWER BACK IS ON THE BALL AS YOU'RE PUSHING UP BECAUSE IT'S GOT A LOT OF STRAIN IN YOUR NECK SO AS YOU'RE SETTING UP KEEP YOUR FREE WEIGHTS DOWN BY YOUR SIDES AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME FROM A SEATED POSITION TO ROLL YOURSELF ALL THE WAY DOWN UNTIL YOU FEEL YOUR HEAD AND YOUR SHOULDERS TOUCH THE BALL
THIS IS IT THAT WAY THE MID FIFTIES BECAUSE THE HEAD ACES ALL THE WILD THING IS THE MOST IT IN A THIS IS
THAT'S HEAD AND YOU CAN PUT INTO IT IS THE BEST
WITH THE SHOULDERS AND THE HEAD DISTANCE
IT'S WHERE YOUR FOOT OR FEET GET CAUGHT IN THE RIVER BED WHAT A PAUSE UP ON YOUR BOTTOM BACK AND HEAD AND PUSHES YOU HEAD FIRST IN THE RIVER AND YOU STAY THERE
AND WHAT I AM GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO THE SAME NEW MY HEAD FAT AND
AND AGAIN I'M STILL CAUGHT FROM THE BACKGROUND THAT NICE CROWDING ON THE SHOULDERS AND THE HEAD BUT I'M STILL AND SHADOW
ONE AND THEN JUST REMEMBER WHEN YOU'RE DRAWING IT THAT IT HAS THE FITTED FIRE ON THE HEAD THAT IS PULL DOWN
YOU RELAX YOUR SHOULDERS KEEP YOUR HEAD NICE AND LEVEL AND EXHALE AS YOU PUSH THE BALL AWAY FROM YOU
SO PULL OUT OF FAT POP IT A LITTLE GAUZE AND WRAP IT AROUND THE BIG SHARKS HEAD AND THE TWO ONE OFF OF THE SOUNDS THAT HAS FROWNS FOREVER MORE
OKAY BECAUSE HE HAS A SHORT NECK HE HAS A TENDENCY TO ELEVATE HIS HEAD AND HIS TURNS
SIX IS THE ENGINE THE HEAD OF THE TRAIN
MANY TIMES WE SEE AMATEURS JUST HITTING UP ON THE BALL AND HITTING WITH THE CLUB FACE IS THE HEAD OF THE HANDS AND THE WEIGHT REMAINS BACK IN INTO YOUR BACK LEG YOUR RIGHT LEG FOR RIGHT HANDED PLAYERS
THIS EFFECT BACK IS REALLY GOING TO TEACH YOU THE HABIT OF COMMON TO THE CORRECT IMPACT POSITION AND IF YOU NOTICE HERE MY WEIGHT IS WELL INTO MY LEFT SIDE THE CLUB FACE IS BEHIND MY HANDS SO MY HANDS HER HEAD AND IN THIS POSITION I'M ABLE TO HIT DOWN ON THE BALL
AND THAT'S SET TO PUT YOUR HEAD BACK LIKE THAT THANK YOU
IF YOU NOTICE I'M THAT MAYBE MY SHOULDERS DO THIS AND KEEP THE SHOULDERS DOWN CURL THE HEAD AND THEN YOU LIFT YOU THEN YOU LOWER AND YOU ON CURL SO THAT'S ABOUT THAT THEY NEED FOR A ROLL UP
SO I'M EXTENDING OVER THE HEAD AND IN THIS ACTION HERE IS WHEN THE LATS ARE GOING TO KICK IN MUCH OF A LARGE MUSCLE THE BACK AND ALSO THE PECTORALS MAJOR
WE'RE GOING OVER THE HEAD AND PULLING BACK OVER THE CHEST
AGAIN IN THIS POSITION YOU WANT TO GET YOUR HEAD RESTING ON THE BALL AND NOT LET YOUR HIPS SAG SO YOU'RE GOING TO USE THE GLUTES TO CONTRACT TO LIFT THE HIPS AND HAVE YOUR HEAD IN LINE WITH YOUR SPINE
MAKE SURE YOU GET IN UNDERNEATH THE HAIR AS MUCH TENSION IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD AS YOU PAID TO THE SIZE AND THE TOP
I'M GOING TO CARRY HERE A NICE HEAD MASSAGE WITH A SHAMPOO
SO SHE'S ONE LONG LINE OF ENERGY FROM THE CROWN OF HER HEAD ALL THE WAY DOWN TO HER TOES
AND THAT COULD BE MADE INTO A NARROW HEAD
IT WILL TAKE THE REINS OVER HER HEAD AND WE'RE GOING TO COME AROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE AND RUN THE RIGHT STIR UP UP
IT'S ALSO AN OPTION TO HAVE A STALL CARDS THAT YOUR HORSE IS ABLE TO STICK ITS HEAD OUT AND THE VENTILATION IS IMPROVED EACH
WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS YOU DON'T WANT TO BRING THE SHOTGUN HERE AND BRING YOUR HEAD DOWN LIKE SO
WE'RE HERE EYES FOR A REVERSE YOCOM INTO THE SIDE OF THE HEAD
YOU'LL NEED SOME FELT OR SOME FUN FOAM TO CUT THE HEAD AND FOR THE TAIL AND THE WINGS
EVERYTHING FROM ONE BLADE TO FOR BLADES ON A SINGLE HEAD
SO COME ON DOWN AND YOU WANT TO JUST REST YOUR HEAD GENTLY ON YOUR ARM
IF IN THE TWIST AND HEAD FIRST ENTRY YOU TWIST MORE THAN WHAT THEY CAN STEER NINETY DEGREES I'M GOING TO HEAD FIRST ENTRY NOW SHOULD BE LANDING THIS WAY BUT I HAPPENED TO TWIST MY BODY MORE THAN NINETY DEGREES OKAY IT IN ORDER TO CENTER THAT A VEIL DIED
THE SPINE STAYS IN NEUTRAL WHICH MEANS THE HEAD HAS TO STAY LIFTED
I WILL GET A HEAD PIN WITH ANOTHER SILVER BEAD AND IT ON THE BOTTOM HALF OF IT AND THEN THE LARGE BEAD AND THEN ANOTHER SILVER BEAD ON TOP SO IT LOOKS LIKE SO
SO WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO FORM THE HEAD BY JUST OPEN THIS UP AND RABBIT EAR FOLDING THIS LIKE SO
NOW FOR THE TOP OF THE HEAD WE ARE GOING TO FOLD IT DOWN SO THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THE HEAD OF THE HORSE
SO WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT DOWN INTO THE HEAD INSTEAD OF THROUGH THE BACK OF THE EYE
ONE VERY IMPORTANT DRILL THAT BEGINNERS SUMMER'S CAN USE IS SIMPLY IN THEIR OWN BAT HARNAGE CUSIANA SWIMMING POOL IN THAT SIMPLY PUTTING YOUR FACE THE WATER BLOWING AIR BUBBLES OUT NICE AND SLOW AND TURNING YOUR HEAD TO THE SIDE
BREATHING DRILLS FOR FREESTYLE REALLY QUITE IMPORTANT HELP MAXIMIZE YOUR VIDEO TO CAPACITY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY KEEP THE HEAD DOWN AND FOCUSED
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD FRAMING FOR OF HER HEAD SHOT THAT CERTAINLY ADEQUATE BUT IT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE INTERESTING IF WE CAN JUST SHIFT YOUR SHOULDERS A LITTLE BIT
LET'S SHOW HER FACE AND NOT MUCH MORE THAN THAT BUT WE'VE BEEN THAT FRAME THE NEXT THING THAT WILL REALLY DEAL WITH IS POSING AND THE POSES FOR A HEAD SHOT FOR A HEAD SHOT FOR AN ACTING OR A MODELING PORTFOLIO
WE HAVE GOOD FRAMING OF CABLE IN OR INNER FRAME THAT'S ABOUT PERFECT FOR HEAD SHOT
YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO DO THIS EVERY TIME YOU PLAY AT THE HEAD AND VERY CAREFULLY REMOVE OUR INNER THIGHS FROM OUR OUTER
MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO PLAY HERE GET HEAD SHOT BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF COVER
NOW IF YOU WANTED TO YOU COULD USE COLORED MATCH STICKS MATCHES RATHER WHERE THE THE HEAD OF THE MATCH IS A DIFFERENT COLOR AND YOU CAN ALTERNATE THOSE COLORS
BECAUSE THE OTHER CONSIDERATION AND THIS IS WHERE MOST YOUR HEAT LOSS WILL COME FROM IS AROUND YOUR NECK AND FROM YOUR HEAD
SO YOUR HEAD COVERING AND AROUND YOUR NECK BECOME VERY VERY CRITICAL TO MAINTAIN YOUR BODY IN SUBZERO TEMPERATURES
I YOU KNOW WHAT MY SHOULDERS FIRST AND THEN I ON ROLL MY HEAD
BECAUSE THE TOP SECTION IS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN THE TWO SECTIONS THAT WE HAD IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD I CAN JUST COMPLETELY DROP THIS SECTION DOWN AND COMB THE HAIR AND ITS NATURAL FALL
AGAIN A SIMILAR MY GUIDE IS SIMPLY LET THAT SLIP BETWEEN MY FINGERS AND NOW WE'VE TOTALLY CUT THE BACK AND JUST TRIM THAT WHERE WE HAVE A NICE HARD EDGE ARE NICE HARD PERIMETER LINE BLUNT LIME FOR THE BACK OF THE HEAD
YOU CAN DO A HAMSTRING STRETCH FOR THE BACK OF YOUR LEGS LYING ON YOUR BACK AND BRING YOUR LEG OVER YOUR HEAD
