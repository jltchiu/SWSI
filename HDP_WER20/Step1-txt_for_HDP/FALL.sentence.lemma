JACKS AND JACK STANDS NEED TO BE PLACED ON IN THE JUST IS SECURED VEHICLE SO IT DOESN'T FALL TUMBLE
UNICYCLES I'VE WRITTEN WITH THEY ALL EVERY WITH THE SAME THING OKAY NOW WHEN I'M LEANING BACK ANOTHER REASON IS BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO FALL AND YOU'RE GOING TO FALL YOU WANT TO FALL BACKWARDS OKAY SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THAT IN A FUTURE STEP THREE STAY TUNED
IF YOU'RE AFRAID YOU'RE GOING TO FALL FORWARD THEN PUT A BLANKET IN FRONT OF YOU
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BODY AS YOU ARE NOT FALL
NEW BUDDIES DID I FALL DOWN THAT IN THE BLOOD TO REUSE THE FRAME TO MOVE THE MEANING OFF ONE
I'VE DONE THIS EVERY SPRING EVERY FALL AND I FOUND THAT MOST OF THE WEEDS IN MY LAWN ARE GONE WITH LITTLE TO NO TROUBLE AT ALL
SO IT'S IT'S FUN TO COME UP WITH CREATIVE CATEGORIES AND AND REALLY PUSHING THEM TWO OF THEM TO BE SPONTANEOUS AND NOT SENSOR LET LET SOMETHING FALL OUT
THIS IS A DYNAMIC ROPE SO THAT MEANS IS IF YOU FALL ON IT IT'S GOING TO STRETCH TO ABSORB THE SHOCK FROM FALLING
AFTER YOU DO THAT AROUND AS MUCH AS YOU NEED TO TO GET A FEEL FOR IT AND YOU CAN LITERALLY EASE INTO WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE FALL NEXT POSE
DON'T TOUCH THE INSIDE BECAUSE THERE AND THEY FALL GOING THE COVENANT THEN FOLD COATING ON THE INSIDE OF THE LENS

AS THE BODY TURNS THE FALL AWAY FROM ME I JUST FOLLOW UP STEPPING THROUGH
ALL THE OTHER FINGERS ARE BASICALLY USED AS FALL FROM POINTS FOR PUSHING THE RING OUT AND FORWARD
YOU CAN RUB IT UNTIL THE LEAVES FALL OFF OR YOU CAN PULL IT BACK AND PULL THESE OFF OR IF YOU HAVE A SHARP KNIFE YOU CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND CUT ALL THE STEMS OFF FOR A FOR FOR FOR HELP THEM
IF YOU DIDN'T LEVEL WANT TO HANG OR SOMETIMES THEY FALL OFF BECAUSE THE TOPS TOO HEAVY
IF YOUR CAT IS COMFORTABLE WITH THAT LITTLE HOLE WHICH IS A BIG STOPPING POINT FOR A LOT OF CATS THAT YOU CAN START MAKING THE WHOLE BIGGER LITTLE BIGGER LITTLE BIGGER LITTLE BIGGER AND BASICALLY THE IDEA IS AND YOU CAN YOU CAN USE A LITTLE ON THE THAT SOMETHING AT THE HARDWARE STORE THAT YOU CAN USE TO TO LINE THE INSIDE OF THE HOLES WILL LEARN DOESN'T FALL RIGHT THROUGH ON BUT AS I GET BIGGER AND BIGGER THE GOAL IS TO GET BIG ENOUGH THAT THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF LITTER ON THE OUTSIDE AND THEN THERE'S NO LITTER AT ALL
I LIKE THIS IT THIS TIRE UNDERNEATH THE FRAME TO FILL THIS SEWN BUMPS INTO THE CAR KNOCKS IT OFF THE STANCE IT WILL FALL ENTIRE ITSELF AND THEN THE CARD DOESN'T FALL ON THE GROUND
BASICALLY IF YOU CLICK AND DRAG IT TO DRAG OUT TO THE SUNLIGHT DEPENDING ON HOW FALL FROM THE ORIGINAL POINT THESE HANDLES ALL WILL DEPEND ON HOW WIDE EAT YOUR OFF IT'S GOING TO BE
IT HAS TO ACTUALLY FALL SOMETHING TO MAINTAIN THE ILLUSION
IF IT IS NOT DOING HOMEWORK AND AGAIN THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET GOOD GRADES IT'S NOT MY FALL THEY NEED TO PUT IN THE EFFORT I CAN MAKE THEM SO FAR HALFWAY
THEY DON'T WANT TO DRY OUT TO THE BONE IS IF IT'S JUST REALLY REALLY DRY SOMETIMES YOU'LL LOSE THEM BUT I'VE HAD SOME OF THEM JUST DIE BACK BECAUSE YOU QUICK WATERING THEM IN ITS MAYBE TOO MUCH SUN AND THEN WHEN IT RAINS IN THE FALL TO COME RIGHT BACK UP
ONE THING I'VE KNOWN ABOUT HOSTAS TOO BECAUSE THEY ARE USUALLY IN THE SHADE IN THE SUMMER TIME WHEN MY TREES ARE REALLY FULL OF LEAVES I HAVE TO WATER I'M PRETTY WELL BUT IN THE WINTER TIME WHEN THE THEY LOOSER LEAVES THEY PRETTY MUCH GET WATER ON THEIR OWN SO THERE'S KIND OF TIMES IN THE SPRING IN THE FALL OR YOU DO HAVE TO WATCH EVEN IF IT'S RAINING OUTSIDE THAT YOU DO GIVE HIM SOME WATER BECAUSE THEY'LL STILL DRY OUT IF THEY'RE NOT GETTING ANY WATERING CAN LOSE AND EVEN IN THE SPRING OR THE FOAM
MY EASELS FIND IT WORRY THINGS FALL PART OF TIME YOU JUST KEEP KEEP WORKING
OKAY SO NOW WE HAVE OUR SCARECROW COMPLETELY PUT TOGETHER AND THESE ARE REALLY GREAT IN THE FALL LIKE I SAID AROUND HALLOWEEN
I'VE GOT CANNA LILIES CALLA LILIES ACID IN THERE A BEGONIAS AND ALL THESE TYPES OF PLANTS ARE GENERALLY YOU PUT IT PROBABLY WOULD PUT TOGETHER BUT I FOUND THEY LOVE BEAD TOGETHER AND YOU'LL BE SURPRISED ALL SUMMER THROUGH FALL
THIS THEY HAVE WHAT'S CALLED THE PASSING STRIKE WITH THE OUT WHEN THE MINUTE HAND PASS THE OUR WOULD JUST LIFT THE HAMMER UP AND LET IT FALL ON THE BELL ONE TIME

I'D LIKE YOU HAVE A CHILDLIKE FROM THE TOP PROCESS THAT THIS IS FUN AND IF YOU FALL THAT YOU GET RIGHT BACK UP AND INTO THE POSE AGAIN
TAKE YOUR PAINT AND ROLL IT A LITTLE BIT ON THE EDGE OF YOUR TOWEL WHATEVER YOU'RE USING TODAY UP WITH AND GIVE YOU A CHANCE HOW YOUR WATER A CHANCE TO FALL OUT

YOUR SECOND SHOCK CRAB IS ABOUT TWO INCHES BELOW YOUR KNEE FALL AND IT'S ORANGE
EVERY TIME YOU LIFT YOUR PADDLE UP AND SCREEN YOU HAVE A TENDENCY TO FALL INTO THE RAFT OR OUT OF THE ROD
IF YOU FALL INTO THE ROCK TO THE HAS UNINFLATED FOR YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT IT JUST COMEDY OUTSIDE TO BE GOING TO CONTINUE ON DOWN STREAM
SEE SHE CAN'T FEEL THE LOWER BACK EXPAND RISE AND FALL
AND THEN SO BEGIN TO SEE IF SHE CAN'T FEEL THE BELLY RISE WITH EVERY INHALE AND FALL WITH EVERY EXHALE
IF YOU'RE BUYING A FROG A PET STORE HOPEFULLY THEY'VE IDENTIFY THE CORRECT WAY YOU CAN FALL OFF OF INFORMATION ABOUT THAT
ALSO IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN COLLEGE OR STILL FALL INTO THE STUDENT REALM ALWAYS GOOD TO BRING YOUR COLLEGE ID OR INTERNATIONAL STUDENT CARD
CARDS ALL FALL UNDER TO CATEGORIES LAND OR SPELLS
ANY EARLIER THAN THAT WILL FALL PEOPLE STILL CHARADE ARE THAT ANY LATER THAN THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS THE COMPETITION PEOPLE'S COUNTERS WE'RE ALREADY FILL UP
AND THEN YOU JUST DROP THIS RIGHT IN THERE GENTLY AND LET IT FALL UNTIL IT STOPS FALLING
SO YOU START IN THAT MOUNTAIN POSE HANDS THAT YOUR HEART CENTER DOWN AT YOUR SIDE WHICHEVER YOU PREFER ON AN INHALE YOU'RE GOING TO SCOOP IT UP ON AN EXHALE YOU'RE GOING TO FALL IN FLOORING
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IN CLOSE YOUR EYES IS I'M GOING TO USE THAT COLOR RIGHT ON HER LID AND I'M JUST GOING TO PRESS IT RIGHT IN AND I'M NOT SWIPING THE BRUSH BECAUSE ESPECIALLY WITH MORE OF A PIGMENTED COLOR IF YOU SWIPE IT YOUR SOMETIMES GOING TO GET THAT FALL DOWN DOWN HERE AND WE REALLY WANT TO AVOID THAT BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY WORKED ON HER EYE MAKEUP OR ON HER SKIN SKIS ME
ON THE TOP PART THERE'S GOING TO BE A BEAD PLACED ON IT SO THAT THE THE BALL WILL SO IT'S SECURELY WON'T FALL OFF THE STICK
SEE IF YOU CAN HOLD THIS FOR SAY FIVE TO TEN BREATHS JUST THAT GENTLE GENTER GENTLE PRESSURE MAKING AWARE OF YOUR CENTER POINT MAKING YOU AWARE OF THIS POWER IN YOUR ARMS AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE EXHALE TO RELEASE JUST LET YOUR HANDS FALL TO YOUR KNEE
YOU NEED TO FALL THAT GUIDE
IT STARTS DOWN TO YOUR FEET AND TRAVELS ALL IT TO YOUR KNEES UP TO YOUR BY TO GET THAT ONE MOTION AND YOU FALL THROUGH
DON'T FORGET ALL THE PIECES YOU TO FALL
MOVE DOWN AND A LITTLE BIT BACK AND YOU'RE GOING TO FALL INTO A SPACE BETWEEN THE MUSCLE TENDON AND THE KICK AND THE BOTTOM AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUT STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN PRESSURE IN THAT AREA
IF YOU MISS LIKE THIS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO A FIVE FORTY TAIL TAP OR YOU'RE JUST GOING TO FALL
IF YOUR SCARECROW IS STUFF AND PUT TOGETHER CORRECTLY HE'S JUST GOING TO SET UP ON IS ELLEN AND THAT'S GOING TO BE GREAT FOR OUTSIDE FOR THE FALL SEASON
HAVE THEIR SINCE HER HAIR IS FINE IS GOING TO WANT TO USE SOMETHING LIGHT HOLD SOME OF YOUR WAX IS IN THE FALL A LITTLE BIT HEAVIER FINER HAIR
AS IT GETS TALLER YOU MAY WANT TO DUCT TAPE YOUR OLD MAGAZINES ARE BOOKS TOGETHER JUST MAKE SURE THAT IT'S REAL STABLE BECAUSE THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS FOR YOUR CAT JUST HAVE THE LITTER BOX SLIDE ANYWHERE FALL
WHEN WE PUT IT IN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT GOES IN FAR ENOUGH THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO FALL OUT BECAUSE ONCE THIS RAT IS DRY YOU DON'T HAVE THE OPTION OF PUTTING IT IN AGAIN
WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS BE CUTTING YOUR MATERIAL IN THE MIDDLE OF BOTH OF YOUR SOFT HORSES BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET ALMOST ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE END IS JUST GOING TO BREAK AND EVERYTHING IS GOING TO FALL IN THE CENTER AND YOU COULD POTENTIALLY GET INJURED
YOU WANT THE CUTS AND OF YOUR MATERIAL TO DROP OFF OF ONE SIDE SO WHEN YOU RUN THE SAW DOWN HERE IT WILL FALL OFF THE SIDE ON TO THE GROUND
IT'S THE SAME THING AND ALL YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE GOLF BALL AS YOU FALL THROUGH IT AND NOT LOOKING FOR YOUR SHOULDER SO IF YOU LOOK UP
THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE LARGE ROCK STRUCTURE SITTING ON GRAVEL LIKE POSSIBLY MOVE BECAUSE THE ROCKS OR TO FALL OVER AND BREAK THE GLASS OR THE AQUARIUM BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE TO BUY HOLD THE AQUARIUM AND YOU HAVE A MESS TO CLEAN UP AS WELL
AND IS YOU CAN SEE I SHAKE IT FREQUENTLY JUST GET THE MATERIAL TO FALL TOGETHER
AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME AND YOU CAN'T REMEMBER WHETHER YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TURN THE CLOCK FORWARD OR BACK YOU CAN SPRING FORWARD OR FALL BACK
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING WHEN YOU LOWER YOUR HEAD IN THIS WAY IS THAT YOU'RE LENGTHENING THE MUSCLES IN YOUR NECK RATHER THAN AND TEACHING YOUR HEAD HAVE FALL FORWARD RATHER THAN A INCREASING THE LENGTHEN YOUR SPINE
REASON BEING IS SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT HAVE THE BALL AND THE TEAM MIGHT FALL YOUR BUT YOU MIGHT STILL MAINTAIN POSSESSION OF THE BALL OR TEAMMATE MIGHT CAUSE THAT'S THE BALL AND GIVE YOURSELF A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SCORE A GOAL
YOU NEVER WANT TO FALL ON LIKE CONCRETE OR ASPHALT YOU CAN REALLY SCREW YOURSELF UP THAT WAY
OKAY YOU SEE HOW I COULD FALL FLAT AND BECOME PART OF THE BACKGROUND
WHERE COMFORTABLE CLOSE BECAUSE A LOT OF GOOD METER SHOWERS OR IN THE WINTER IN THE FALL
YOU CAN LET YOUR LEGS RELAX AND FALL OUT IF A SEATED SEATED POSES UNCOMFORTABLE FOR YOU
NOW IN THE FALL YOU WILL SEE OFTEN TIMES THE LARGE SEED AND SO THE VERY KIND OF THE BURN ORANGE TOP WHICH OF FAIRLY COMMON
WILL FALL DOWN REALLY SLOW
BECAUSE SOME OF THE MINERAL PARTICLES ARE HEAVIER THAN OTHERS AND THEY'LL FALL OUT OF THE SUSPENSION AND YOU WON'T GET A TRUE GLAZE RESULT
THESE ARE MORE LIKE A FABRIC SO THEY DON'T TEND TO FALL APART IS EASY ALMOND ALSO THEY'RE GREAT FOR USING I ACTUALLY ON THE SURFACE OF YOUR PIECE FOR CLEANING UP EDGES AND WIPING AWAY EXTRA ADHESIVE THAT'S MAYBE ON BEEN APPLIED TO THICKLY
YOU'LL SEE AS I GO ON FURTHER BUT I ALWAYS LIKE TO HAVE A NICE CLEAN OR TOWEL THAT I TEND TO USE AND THEN I PREFER THE SHOP TOWELS MOSTLY BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE USING ANY SORT OF STANDARD KITCHEN TOWELS THEY TEND TO BREAK APART FALL APART AND ACTUALLY GETS STUCK TO YOUR FINGERS AS YOU'RE TRYING TO WIPE OFF ADHESIVES
THE BIGGEST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH FRAMES IS THAT THIS PART BREAKS IF IT BREAKS THAN WRAPPED YOU DON'T HAVE THE TENSION THE FLAP ON HOLD IN PLACE AND INTO THE WHOLE THING JUST FALL OPERATE PROPERLY
AND THIS IS THREE THOUSAND AND CDS OF BIOTIN THAT'S ABOUT THE DOUGH IS THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO GET YOUR HAIR WILL BECOME THICK AND FALL AND I REALLY SHORT NAILS SO IT ALSO MAKES MY NAILS GROW REALLY LONG AND FAST
THESE ARE ALL THE TIME DO NOT COVER THE HOLES CIRCUMFERENCE OF YOUR FACE SO ALWAYS CONSIDER THAT YOU CANNOT WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU FALL
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE IT MOSTLY DURING THE SPRING SUMMER MAYBE EARLY FALL
IT'S MOST SENSITIVE THIS STRANDS TEND TO FALL OUT MORE IF YOU PULL ON IT TOO HARD
WHEN YOU'RE WALKING A CROSS COUNTRY YOU REALLY WANT TO AVOID ANY VISUAL OBSTACLES YOU CAN SEE AS OFTEN TIMES THEY'LL BE A EMPTY AREAS BELOW THE SNOW THAT YOU WILL FALL THROUGH AND AND THERE'S A RISK OF INJURY
THEY DON'T HAVE A FOUR WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE SAFE IF THEY FALL DOWN
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE ENOUGH ROOM WITH THE NECKLINE FOR ALL THE CORNERS TO FALL SO THIS IS THE MORE NARROW PART OF THE HEAD
IT'S NICE TO ALL OF US I CAN SEE IT'S BACK AND THEN YOU SAY OH WILL FALL ITEM THAT IT'S NOT ABLE TO
THE WOODS BALL TO AT YOUR LOCAL HOSPITAL FALL INTO AT THE FOOD BANK VOLUNTEER PURSUE KITCHEN
AND AS WITH MOST TACKY PRESSURE POINTS YOUR FINGERS ARE GOING TO FALL INTO THIS HOLE
IT'S THE FALL IS NOT COLD IS SET TO HOT NOT A PROBLEM BUT IN THE WINTERTIME IN THE SUMMERTIME INSULATION IS A GREAT THING TO HAVE IN THE HOUSE
IF IT'S LIKE THIS IT'S GOING TO DIG IN AND THEN FALL FREE SO I'M GOING TO KEEP IT UP THE HANDLE UP
WE WANT THE HANDLE TO BE A LITTLE BIT POINTED DOWN SO IF IT CATCHES THIS EDGE WILL FALL FREE OF THE WOOD
I DON'T FALL OVER
IF THE BETTER DOESN'T FALL A THAN THE CROSS DOES NOT COME OUT RIGHT
FOR EXAMPLE IF WE HAD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MELD WE HAVE A DOUBLE RUN A SUIT THAT'S A POWERFUL HAND NOW WE HAVE LOTS OF ROOM BECAUSE ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS MAKE OUR TWENTY MELD THAT'S THE BASIC REQUIREMENT WE SAVE OUR TWENTY MELD HUNDRED FIFTY POINTS IS GOING TO PICK UP AN AWFUL LOT OF OVER ROOM FOR ERROR IF WE FELT FALL SHORT ARE ENCOUNTERS THAT IS IF WE DON'T HAVE MORE THAN YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE A NORMAL COUNTERS THAT'S FINE
THIS WILL DO IS THIS WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO FOCUS ON WE'RE LOOKING AT THE TIP OF THE CLUB WILL SLOW THE FALL DOWN A LITTLE BIT
NOW THIS IS A GREAT GAME TO PLAY AFTER YOU'VE OPENED ALL YOUR GET SOME CHRISTMAS DAY AND HAD A BIG KNEELING PRETTY FALL AND YOU DON'T WANT TO DO ANY RUNNING AROUND AND MAYBE WANT THE KIDS TO CALM DOWN A BIT SO AGAIN YOU CAN GET THE WHOLE FAMILY AROUND IN A CIRCLE AND DO A NICE CALM DEAN
SO YOU JUST WANT TO FALL THAT
LIKE IN THIS ROOM WE'VE CLEARED OUT MOST EVERYTHING SO THAT IF YOU KNOW I FALL OR I SLIPPER TRIP I'M NOT GOING TO HIT MY HEAD ON A CORNER OF A COUCH OR YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO KNOCK A WHOLE BUNCH OF BOOKS OFF A SHELF OR ANYTHING EVERYTHING IS PRETTY PRETTY A CLEAR AND
JUST YOU KNOW TRY TO GET HIM TO FALL IN AN AREA WHERE YOU CAN SEE THEM FALLING IN YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU ARE TRYING TO CATCH THEM IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO CATCH THEM
MOVE CORRECTLY AND THEY'LL FALL AS A RESULT
YOU MOVE IN THE CORRECT MANNER AND THEY'LL FALL
HERE'S THE FALL THE LITTER DRILL
AND SO BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE THE THE LENGTH OF THIS YOU IF YOU BRING IT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH OF OF THE STICK TO ATTACH ITSELF TO THE TEDDY BEAR TO FALL RIGHT OFF
AND THEN ALSO FOR FALL WHETHER PURPOSES YOU CAN GET A LEATHER SHELL TO PUT OVER TOP OF THE MINUTE AND THAT WILL ALSO STILL HAVE A LITTLE CREASE IN IT WHERE YOU GET YOUR FINGER OUT TO WORK THE TRIGGER
FIRST OF ALL THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR LAWN IS TO GIVE IT MORE GRASS SEED IN THE SPRING IN THE FALL
ANYWAY CYSTIC HANDWRITING AND TAKE IT TO A FULL BODY WORKOUT ALL EXPLAINING EACH MOVEMENT COMPLETE WITH PROPER TECHNIQUE FALL A WEEK
NOW YOU WANT TO SPEND SOME TIME ROLLING BACKWARDS IN GETTING COMFORTABLE IN THIS POSITION BECAUSE SINCE YOU DON'T ROLL BACKWARDS VERY OFTEN IT CAN SOMETIMES CATCH YOU OFF GUARD IF YOU HIT SOMETHING TO ROLL AND FALL DIRECTLY IN THE DIRECTION YOU'RE HEADED SO YOU'RE ROLLING BACKWARDS AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR FEET IN THE OLLIE POSITION
AND WITHOUT THE ALPHABET WE EVERYTHING WOULD FALL APART
THEY WOULDN'T BE THEY WOULD JUST FALL APART
BY THREE POINT LIGHTING IS THE VERY BASICS OF ALL LIGHTING IF YOU FALL THESE THINGS AND BRING YOUR INDEPENDENT FILM OR YOUR WHOLE MOVIES TO THE NEXT LEVEL
SO LONG AS THEY'RE NOT THE REALLY FORMAL SOCKS WHICH TEND TO FALL DOWN OFF YOUR ANKLES YOU KNOW WITHIN THE FIRST FIVE SECONDS OF PUTTING THEM ON
SO THE IN CASE JACK FAILS THE CAR IS NOT GOING TO FALL TO THE GROUND POSSIBLY INJURE YOU IN OR DAMAGE YOUR VEHICLE
AND THEN I'M GOING TO HIT THIS IN THE REFRIGERATOR AND I'M GOING TO COVER IT OR PUT FALL ON IT JUST WITH THE CALL
THE MORE YOU FALL DOWN THE MORE I FALL DOWN THE MORE I TRUST MYSELF
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I FALL DOWN
THAT IS NOT THERE FALL
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A TYPE OF PAPER THAT WON'T ON BUCKLE WON'T FALL APART ON YOU ESPECIALLY THIN PAPERS I'M DRAWING PAPERS FROM A DRAWING PAD USUALLY OR A LITTLE TOO THIN FOR DOING THIS TYPE OF PAINTING ON
DON'T FALL INTO WHAT THE BOOT IS CALL AND SEEKING
A LOT OF STYLES LIKE EDO YOU'LL SEE A BIG HUGE WRIST LOCK GET WHICH GIVES IT A REALLY PRETTY FALL IT'S A VERY IMPRESSIVE ON CAMERA
SO NOW WE FOLDED ARE QUEEN SHEET IN QUARTERS NEXT WE'RE GOING TO FALL FOLDED IN HALF AGAIN ON THE SIDE EDGE
IF YOU FALL OUT OF THE ROUGH TODAY A FEW THINGS YOU NEED TO REMEMBER YOU LAY ON YOUR BACK YOU PUT YOUR FEET DOWN STREAM WHICH IS THE DIRECTION THE RIVER IS GOING AND YOU LOOK FOR HELP
YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR BALANCE ON IT SO YOU DON'T FALL
THAT'S HOW IT'S AND THAT FALL
SO IN AND MAKE SURE TO DRAW A LITTLE BUTTING TAIL TO FALL POMPOM
SO WHEN YOU FALL THAT YOUR BODY BOOM AND STOP HIM OUT THAT WAY BOOM ONE NOTE ANYWAY YOU GO BOOM
THERE IS A CYCLE TO THERE AND THEN IT WILL TURN DOWN AND WILL FALL OFF
WE'RE GOING TO USE A METAL POUR POT AND IT'S METAL THROUGHOUT WITH THE HANDLE ON IT SO IT DOESN'T FALL ON THE POT
REMEMBER TO SHORE WHICH ANGLES I'M GOING TO FALL
SO ONE ONE THING THAT WE CAN DO TO GET RID OF THEM INSTEAD OF RUSHING THEM WITH THE BLOCK BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MANY OF THEM WE CAN PLACE A PORTAL UNDER THE DIFFERENT FOR US AND OUT LET THEM FALL THROUGH OR WE CAN PLACE ONE BEHIND AND WALK UP AND GRAB IT LIKE WE'VE BEEN DOING
SO JUST FIFTY IS GOING TO TURN MAKE SURE YOU STAY FLAT ON THE BOX BECAUSE IF YOU ROCK TOO FAR BACK YOU HIT YOUR HEEL EDGE AND FALL BACKWARDS
SO NOW I'LL TALK ABOUT THE GADGETS THE FALL UNDER THE TOOLS CATEGORY
IS IT HITS THAT STRING YOU KIND OF COME BACK KIND OF JUST ON ACTION AS IT'S COMING DOWN YOU KIND OF LET IT FALL BACK DOWN
NOW WHEN IT COMES BACK DOWN IT'S GOING TO FALL INTO THAT BOTTOM STRING THAT'S RIGHT WHERE YOU START FROM AGAIN
THERE'S NO REMOVING THE CAT CAL ON THIS ONE YOU NEED IS JUST GOING TO FALL RIGHT LIKE THAT
AND LIKE I SAY THIS IS A STYER RACER EACH ONE IS YOU WANT IT BEHIND A PERSON AND THEY'RE RUNNING FALL POSITION INTO THAT EVENT OR INTO THE RICE
YOU GET OF ALL WE'RE NOT FALL THROUGH ANOTHER ONE TO THE NEXT ONE
I'M GOING TO SLIDE IT IN SO THAT THE RECORD CANNOT FALL OUT AND HAS NO CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE
ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M SHOWING YOU GUYS HOW TO FALL BUT ONE REALLY
ALSO ANOTHER QUICK POINTER MENTION THE FALL BY ONE IS THE YOU HAVE TO GET THE BATON SAFELY AROUND THE TRUCK WHICH IS A FORM OF A LOT AND SOMETIMES THE LOCK OF SPEED COMPENSATE FOR BASIC BATON EXCHANGES
AND AGAIN MOST OF THESE HAVE A LITTLE A LITTLE HOOK RIGHT HERE SO THAT YOU CAN WRAP THE CHAIN AROUND THE HANDLE AND HOOK IT ONTO ITSELF SO YOUR CHAIN DOESN'T FALL INTO YOUR CUP
MAYBE IT'S LITTLE PAID MAYBE IT'S A LOT OF WORK AND YOU DON'T FALL AND GETTING THE KITE USER
THAT'S THE MAIN THING WHEN YOU'RE WRITING YOUR BOARD OR YOU WILL FALL OFF
BECAUSE THE TOP SECTION IS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN THE TWO SECTIONS THAT WE HAD IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD I CAN JUST COMPLETELY DROP THIS SECTION DOWN AND COMB THE HAIR AND ITS NATURAL FALL
THIS HERE IT WON'T NECESSARILY COME ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK SO JUST COME AND ITS NATURAL FALL
