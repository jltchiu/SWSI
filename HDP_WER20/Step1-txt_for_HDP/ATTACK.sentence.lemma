BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT LARGER BIRDS ARE CROW'S TO GET IN THERE AND ATTACK THE BABIES
I LIKE TO USE A WAX ON CHROME BUMPERS ON WHEELS PARTICULARLY IN A HARSH ENVIRONMENT YOU'RE LIKE WE'RE IN UTAH THERE'S A LOT OF FOAM ROAD ROAD GRIME THAT HAS A TENDENCY TO ATTACK AND WORK ON THE CHROME SO ACTUALLY LEAVE THE PROTECTIVE COAT AND FINISH ON THE CHROME
FOR INSTANCE IF IT'S A FRONT HAND JAP IT WOULD NOT BIG SYSTEM YOU MOVE THIS FOOT AND THEN STEP IN AND JAB BECAUSE THAT IS THIS FOOT MOVED HE SENSES THE ATTACK
PENETRATING FOOTWORK IS ALSO KNOWN AS THE INITIAL MOTION AND THE INITIAL MOVE IT ANY ATTACK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
THERE'S NO IT'S ON THIS IS KIND OF THE DEMONSTRATE THAT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WEAPONS CONNECTOR WHETHER IT'S A KNIFE A GEL LIKE UP THE FIVE FOOT STAFF OR SWORD OR IF IT'S EMPTY HAND ATTACK WITH THE TO GRAB OR A STRIKE ANYTHING TECHNIQUE THAT WE'VE GOT AN IDEAL CAN BE APPLIED TO WHATEVER SITUATION
THE MAJOR THING THAT I KEEP COMING BACK TO OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT DISTURBING AWAY THIS SORT OF THING CALLED THE ATTACK POSITION WHICH IS NOW JUST LIKE IN SKIING WHERE LIKE A PARALLEL SHOULDERS SQUARED OFF TO THE HILL IS WHERE YOU'RE GOING FOR A CAN MEDICALLY
HIS GOALS TO HIT IT RIGHT ABOVE THE TIN EITHER REAL SOFT SO JUST COMES OUT AS A WINNING DROP SHOT OR TO ATTACK THE NICK
OKAY I'M GOING TO GIVE GARY A SERVE AND HE'S GOING TO ATTACK OFF THE SERVER WITH A DROP VOLLEY OR A DROP OR AN ATTACKING VOLLEY
SO GARY JUST DEMONSTRATED A HEART ATTACK IN VOLUME ON THAT ONE A SOFT DROP SHOT
SO YOU WANT TO ATTACK THE BALL WHICH IS WHAT YOU WOULD DO DURING THE PASSING PATTERN YOU WANT TO ATTACK THE BALL AND GET IT INTO YOUR POSITION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
SO NOW THEY GET A SENSE OF ATTACK THEY GET A SENSE OF A WEAPON THEY GET A SENSE OF WHAT TARGETS BEING THREAD AND SO THIS BASE THE TECHNIQUE VERY EFFECTIVE
I BLEND WITH THE ATTACK IN HERE IN
THEY'RE TERRITORY GENERALLY ONLY COVERS A SMALL AREA FOR EXAMPLE OF A SMALL CORAL HEAD IN THE SAND BUT THEY WILL ATTACK ANYTHING THAT GETS TOO CLOSE TO IT INCLUDING FISH MUCH LARGER THAN ITSELF
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR HANDS FLAT YOU WANT TO ARCH OVER WHETHER YOU'RE PLAYING A SCALE OR IF YOU'RE PLAYING A CHORD YOU WANT TO CERTAIN LITTLE ARCH AND WITH YOUR PICKING HAND YOU SIMPLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO I STRUM DOWN OR IF YOU'RE PICKING YOU WANT YOUR HAND VERY RELAXED YOUR ARM REST IT OVER LIKE OVER THIS OR EVEN IF THERE'S NOT A CONTOUR HERE EVEN IF IT'S A STRAIGHT YOU WHEN YOUR HAND REACHING OVER THAT WHERE YOUR ATTACK IS OVER THE PICK UPS
REMEMBER AVOID THE ATTACK CONTROL THE SITUATION MAKE YOUR CHOICE TO CHOOSE YOUR OPTION
BUT SOMETIMES OR NOT ENTIRELY FOR WITH THE DISTANCE OF OUR POINTS ATTACK WILL BE OR WE JUST NEED MORE DISTANCE PROTECT YOURSELF IN THAT CASE WE USE TO QUICK BUT SHORT RETREATS TO AVOID OUR OPPONENTS ATTACK
IF THE BASKETBALL IS GOING OFF THE LEFT SIDE YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACK THE LEFT SIDE
IF THE BALL GOES OFF THE RIGHT SIDE YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACK THE RIGHT SIDE
WHAT YOU GOT TO DO THE FUNDAMENTALS FIRST THEN GO IN ATTACK THE BASKETBALL
IN THIS CASE AGAIN ONE WILL MAKE ATTACK WE'RE GOING TO HIT THE OTHER WILL EITHER YOU DO COW OUR TACKLE OR MAKE IT YOUR TAKE OVER IT
IN THIS CASE YOU SEE AS SHE'S MAKING HER ATTACK IT MAKES YOUR CUP AND A SKATE SAFELY AVOIDING THE HEAD
WHEN LOOKING AT LONG DISTANCE DEFENSE OPTIONS ARE OFTEN LIMITED TO EITHER MAKING THE ATTACK SHORTENED IGNORE WE'RE DOING COUNTER TACK
THIS TIME RACHEL MAKES THE ATTACK OR RATHER THE PREPARATION AND I'M A WILL ATTACK AS SHE COMES FORWARD
OKAY IT'S VERY EASY FOR YOU TO ATTACK THAT WAY
WE MADE STUFFED POTATO BUT I ATTACK THE STAFF TORTILLA AND WE NEED A CARD AS THE WONDERFUL SNACK TO HAVE ON YOUR RAINY DAY WHEN WHEN IT'S COLD OUTSIDE
I'M STILL HAS TO GRIP THE CHARGER ME HERE FOR A MELEE ATTACK THEM ON
ANOTHER GOOD REASON TO USE THE MELEE ATTACK IS BECAUSE IT HELPS CONSERVE URINATION WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT LIMITED
THESE GUYS ATTACK THESE TWO GUYS ALRIGHT
IN THIS CASE EMMA BEGINS PREPARING HER ATTACK AND AS SHE DOES SHE IS HITTING THE HEAD
THIS IS CALLED ATTACK IN PREPARATION
ONE OF THE THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND IS AS YOU'RE COMING FORWARD AND YOU'RE PREPARING TO MAKE YOUR ATTACK YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY ATTACKING AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY BE SCORED AGAINST DURING THIS TIME IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL
YOU'LL NOTICE ALSO HOW I'M GETTING OFF THE LINE OF THIS ATTACK RIGHT HERE
THE DISADVANTAGE IS THAT WHEN THEY DECIDE TO MAKE THEIR OWN ATTACK THEY CAN BE A LITTLE BIT FARTHER SO EACH HAS AN ADVANTAGE AND IT DISAPPEAR
SO HE'S GOING TO ATTACK IT AS A SKI GOING GO HERE
SO DON'T BE AFRAID TO BEFORE YOU CAN USE KIND OF OR BECAUSE THE CARD OR DRIVE TRAIN WITH KIND OF GIVE YOU ENOUGH GRIP AND GET YOU THROUGH A CORNER JUST LOOKS ATTACK THIS LONG A SWEEP ARE RIGHT HERE
HOW DO I ATTACK WITH THIS EFFICIENTLY
NOW WE STRUCTURE SHOMEN AND JUST AS THEY DID OVER HERE THEY'RE GOING TO ATTACK WITH THE SKI STEPPING STRIKE MY MID SECTION
ONCE AGAIN ATTACK AND GET IT INTO YOUR POSSESSION
THESE THREE GUYS ATTACK EITHER MAKE THE SHOT A MISSED SHOT
ONCE AGAIN TO ALL THOSE CREATURE DECKS THAT CREATURES GET BENEFITS FROM OTHER CREATURES IS TOTALLY AND HIGHLIGHTS THEIR DECK BECAUSE THEY'RE CREATURES ARE NOT IN PLAY TO GET THE OTHER CREATURES GONE BENEFITS AND BASICALLY THEY HAVE TO START OVER WITH BUILDING THEIR ARM WHICH ALLOWS YOU TIME TO BREAK OUT YOUR SPELLS AND OR ATTACK WITH YOUR CREATURES THAT ARE STILL IN PLAY
WHEN YOU ATTACK OR WHEN YOU DEFENDING YOUR POKEMON HAS A WEAKNESS THE RESISTANCE
THEN ALL I HAVE A RESISTANCE OF THIRTY THAT MEANS THAT WILL TAKE ANY DAMAGE IT ALL BECAUSE I TAKE THIRTY OFF WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS THEY ATTACK WITH
IT MAKES IS ATTACK SCRATCH FOR <UNK>
GET A NICE WASH WITHOUT ALL THE ATTACK IS IT A AS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN USING FIX
AN ATTACK OR BACK IN THIS CASE WHEN YOU'RE HITTING THE EDGE OF THE RIM EDGE OF THE SKIN TO GET THAT VERY CRISP SOUND
SO A GOOD STRONG AN AGGRESSIVE ARMPIT ATTACK IS A VERY GOOD VITAL POINT TO KNOW FOR WOMEN'S SELF DEFENSE
AND I'M GOING TO PULSE OF FOR THREE THIS IS GOING TO ATTACK THE TOP OF THE FRONT OF MY ABS
FOR ANOTHER EDGED WEAPON ATTACK OR DEFENSE FROM A STRAIGHT STAB WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE INSIDE NOW
THIS I'M GOING TO ATTACK THE INSIDE OF THE FOREARM
I'M ALSO GOING TO ATTACK THE WRIST AS WELL
THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO ATTACK
WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL AND HOW TO USE TOOLS LATER BUT IT'S A BASIC OVERVIEW ON WHAT TOOLS YOU'LL NEED TO MAKE YOUR TILE MOSAIC PROJECT YOU'RE GOING TO BE AN ATTACK HAMMER TO BREAK YOUR TILES WITH
A FAKE IS AN INDIRECT ATTACK AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE EASIEST A BALL TECHNIQUE FAKE
AS THE ATTACK YOU'RE GOING TO BLOCK THE LEFT AND DRIVE THE PALM TOWARDS THE NECK
ATTACKED ATTACK THE RIM ALRIGHT
SECOND THING IS ATTACK
RIGHT LIKE THAT SO IF I DID BY KEEPING THE BALL BACK PART OF THE WALL THEY CAN'T ATTACK ME VERY MUCH I'LL USE THE BIG BALL
SEE THAT THAT'S GOING TO HELP YOU STRONGLY RECOVER BACK CROSS TO BE ABLE TO ATTACK THE BALL
SO THIS IS MORE OF ATTACK TO PRACTICE RACE BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE
SO IT'S YOU KNOW THE COROLLARY TO THIS SORT OF ATTACK IS IN THIS WHOLE MINDSET WHICH IS ABOUT YOU KNOW COMMITTING TO THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO
