ANOTHER THING THAT YOU CAN USE ARE THESE SOFT THAT THEY'RE SOLD IN CRAFT STORES TO ACTUALLY MAKE RUBBER STAMPS OUT AND BUY HEATING A METAL OBJECT AND PUSHING IT ON THERE UNTIL IT FORMS A IMAGE

THEY PAINTED ON THE PIECE OF STEEL THAT THEY WANT AND THEY'LL PUT THEIR PATTERN DOWN AND THEN THEY'LL USE WHEN I'M METAL SCRIBE OR SHARP OBJECT AND THEY'LL SCRIBE THROUGH THE PAINT ON TO THE STEEL
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS MAKING A SMALL OBJECT DISAPPEAR BY THE WAY UP THE FRENCH DROP

MY SUBJECT NEW DOES ALL THESE YOU THAT YOU DID THE OBJECT
BALL IS THAT YOU CAN GET THE OBJECT
CERTAINLY WITH THE DENTIST IS MOST NOTORIOUS FOR IS THE HAND DRILL WHICH IS AN OBJECT THAT WE USE TYPICALLY TO REMOVE CAVITIES SOMETIMES REMOVAL OF FILLINGS OR TO DO IN COSMETIC PREPARATIONS ON TEETH OR EVEN THINGS LIKE REMOVING BONE AROUND TEETH
LIKE THE OBJECT FIRST YOUR PRIMARY SURFACES DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE REFLECTIONS OR WHETHER YOU WANT TO CONCENTRATE ON THE OVERALL SHAPE
USING EVERYDAY OBJECT AND MAKING IT JEWELRY WAS ANOTHER WAY THAT THE PUNK SORT OF WHERE ANTI CONSUMER AS THEY MADE FUN OF THE IDEA OF OF SPENDING ON THINGS LIKE JEWELRY
BECAUSE IF IT SLIDES STRAIGHT INTO THE OBJECT BALL WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THE CUE BALL IS GOING TO IMPART ALL OF ITS ENERGY TO THE OBJECT BALL SENDING THE OBJECT BALL ON ITS WAY IN THE CUE BALL IS GOING TO LOSE EVERYTHING IT'S GOT GOING FOR AND IT'S GOING TO STOP DID STILL
AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF ACTION DO WE NEED TO HAVE ON THE CUE BALL ON CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT BALL IN ORDER TO GET IT TO STOP
IT'S A FAVORITE TOOL OF MY NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH WORK I NEED TO DO WITH IT BUT ALSO JUST BECAUSE AS A TOOL AS AN OBJECT IT HAPPENS TO BE VERY LOVELY VERY BEAUTIFUL

I USUALLY FIND IT'S GOOD TO KIND OF PICK ASIDE AND LESS AN OBJECT SUPPOSED TO BE IN TOTAL DARKNESS SO KIND OF PICK A SIDE THAT YOU WANT THE SHADOW TO GO ON LIKE I'M DOING HERE
NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS DRAW THE EYES BUT BEFORE WE CAN DRAW THE EYES WE NEED TO DRAW A LINE AND THROUGH THE CENTER AND IT'S A CURVE LIVE BECAUSE IT'S GOING AROUND THE CURVES OBJECT
BUT THEN ON THE TOP LEFT HAND CORNER IS AS POST BULLETIN GO AHEAD AND CLICK ON THAT AND YOU WRITE THIS OBJECT
THAT'S ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO DO BECAUSE THIS IS NOT LIKE A FLAT OBJECT IN OUR HOW MUCH IT LOOKS AT THE LINES HAVE TO AND FLOW AND FOLLOW ALONG IN DIFFERENT AREAS
AND THE TURRETS COME THROUGH THE PORTALS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER OBJECT SO YOU CAN REACH IN AND GRAB ONE AND THEN A TABLE AND TAKE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE
