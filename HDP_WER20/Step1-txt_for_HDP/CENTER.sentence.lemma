HELLO I'M SIFU MALLON WITH THE CLEARWATER KUNG FU CENTER THIS IS MY ASSISTANT MELISSA AND THIS IS KUNG FU FOR HEALTH
AND THE MORE ON THE CENTER LINE THAT YOU CAN MOVE THE MORE EFFICIENT THE MOVEMENT IS GOING TO BECOME
AND WE WILL EVENTUALLY SHOW HOW TO ACTUALLY BEND STRAIGHT LINE AND HOW TO TURN THE STRAIGHT LINE BUT STILL STAY ON THE CENTER LINE
REGARDLESS OF WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING YOU'RE ALWAYS MOVING ON THE CENTER LINE
AND IN THE EYE KIDO ICKY JUJITSU A BAGUAS JEANIE BY A ANY OF THE MARTIAL ARTS THAT ARE OUT THERE YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THAT THEY ALL PRIMARILY IN PRINCIPALLY MOVE ON THE CENTER LINE
NOW THIS CAN TURN TO THE SIDE THAT CAN TURN OUT SLIGHTLY BUT PRIMARILY YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE ON A CENTER LINE
SO THAT'S WHAT LIFE IS LIKE AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER
I WORK IN AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER UNIVERSITY A UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER SO MY JOB NOT ONLY INVOLVES RESEARCH BUT ALSO DO A LOT OF TEACHING
MY FINGERS DRIVE IN DOWN TOWARDS HIS CENTER JUST BELOW THE BELLY BUTTON
THE MAIN ONE WHEN I PULL THE SINGLE PART IS THEY'LL BE ALONG ARE IN THE CENTER OF IT AND THEY'LL BE A WASHER AND THIS IS REALLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO LOOK FOR
THERE CAN BE OFF SIDES CALL AGAINST THE CENTER FOR MOVING OR WHAT WE CALL MANIPULATING THE BALL TO THROW OFF THE DEFENSE
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN OUR CENTER GOES DOWN TO SNAP THE BALL THAT WE DON'T GET ANY PENALTIES
IN THE CENTER THE FIGURE EIGHT ON THE SWITCH MY EDGE
I WANT IT TO GO STRAIGHT THROUGH THE CENTER SO THAT I'M SURE I'M GETTING THE FULLEST DIAMETER
FOR REMOVING THE SOFT DEPOSITS CENTER IN AREAS THAT ARE SO FAR UP INTO THE GUM YOU PHYSICALLY CAN'T GET TO THEM
NOW IF IT GETS PASS THESE THIS SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE THEN BACK HERE YOU'LL HAVE THE CENTER WHICH IS AGAIN THE CENTER IT WILL BE THE ONE THAT HOLDS THE PAINT DOWN AND IS IN THE MIDDLE ANYTHING THAT GETS PASS THAT A LOT OF DEFENSE IS HIS OR HER RESPONSIBILITY
SO YOU'LL HAVE THE POINT GUARD UP TOP YOU HAVE A FORWARD RIGHT HERE A CENTER WILL BE A LITTLE FURTHER BACK BUT YOU'LL WHAT YOU'LL HAVE IS YOU HAVE A SMALL FOR HERE YOU'LL HAVE THE SHOOTING GUARD ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SUPPORT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEFENSE
AND THEN YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR SKEWER THROUGH THE CENTER OF THOSE TWO OVERLAPPING FLAPS
IF IN THE TWIST AND HEAD FIRST ENTRY YOU TWIST MORE THAN WHAT THEY CAN STEER NINETY DEGREES I'M GOING TO HEAD FIRST ENTRY NOW SHOULD BE LANDING THIS WAY BUT I HAPPENED TO TWIST MY BODY MORE THAN NINETY DEGREES OKAY IT IN ORDER TO CENTER THAT A VEIL DIED
THIS NEXT CLIP IS WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PUT THE CENTER PIECE ON
OKAY NOW I'VE STRONG ONE HALF OF THE NECKLACE A AS WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT DISKS BEADS AND WE WANT TO GO AHEAD AND BECAUSE OF THIS IS A SIMPLE TYPE OF BEAD WE'RE GOING TO DO IS CENTER PIECE
WHAT I WANT TO DO IS PROBABLY PUT IT A COUPLE SILVER BEADS ON EACH SIDE OF IT SO THAT THEY CAN DANGLE NICE AND IT WON'T BE STUCK IN BETWEEN THE THE BEADS AND IT WILL HANG OF JUST RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF YOUR NECKLACE
SO I'M RIGHT NOW AT THE HALF POINT OF AND READY TO GO AHEAD AND DESIGN MY CENTER PIECE
HELLO I'M SIFU MALLON WITH THE CLEARWATER KUNG FU CENTER
OKAY NOW THIS METHOD OF DOING A KNOB WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO FIRST IS TAKE OUR SCORING TOOL GET IT WET AND SCORE UP THE CENTER WHERE YOU'RE NOT IS GOING TO GO
MAKE SURE YOU'RE BREATHING STAY ENGAGE THE SPINE IS NOW LONG OVER THE CENTER OF YOUR LEG
ALRIGHT MAKE SURE YOU'RE STAYING ENGAGED AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY HOLD THIS FOR QUITE A WHILE ONCE YOU LEARN HOW TO DO EVERYTHING IN THE CENTER
NOW TO MAKE SURE YOU GET AS CLOSE TO THE CENTER OF BALANCE AS POSSIBLE WHEN YOU HOLD IT
I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD WITH TWO IT'S MUCH EASIER TO HOLD HIM UP HERE BUT YOU HAVE A LOT LESS CONTROL WHEN YOU'RE AWAY FROM THE CENTER OF BALANCE
THE FIRST WAY IS JUST USING THE NORMAL TAKE TALK AND PUSHING THE CRYSTAL STICK FROM YOUR FROM THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR LEG UNDER THROUGH THE CENTER
SO AS I'M DRAWING UP I'M THINKING THAT EVERYTHING IS DRAWING INTO MY CENTER
