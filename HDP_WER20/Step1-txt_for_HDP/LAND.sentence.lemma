THE OTHER THING WE CAN DO WITH A POWER LANDING IS AS SOON AS WE LAND YOU MAY USE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BRAKE WILL COMBINATION OF BRAKE AND THROTTLE
SO PICK UP GET THOSE ON YOUR RIGHT FOOT AND YOU'RE GOING TO LAND ON YOUR LEFT ALRIGHT
EXAMPLE WOULD BE BOW LAND STICK ANGLE FLING KOLENDA NOTICE I THROW IN THERE WHAT IS THAT
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION HOW FAST YOU DON'T GET TIMING ON YOU WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN YOU POP THE TRICK NO TIME YOU'RE IN THE AIR AND THEN YOUR CATCH AND THEN YOU KNOW HOW TO LAND
BUT YOU WANT TO START LOOKING INTO YOUR INSIDE SHOULDER WHICHEVER WAY YOU NATURALLY WANT TO SPIN AND AS YOU AS YOU COME IN YOU POP AND YOU PUSH THE BIKE THROUGH AT BUT YOU MAKE SURE TO KEEP LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER BECAUSE YOUR YOUR BODY BASICALLY WILL FOLLOW WHEREVER YOU LOOK SO AS LONG AS YOU KEEP LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LAND JUST FINE
IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SPIN A COMPLETE ONE EIGHTY BECAUSE ONCE YOU START LEARNING THEM YOU'LL CARRY MUCH BETTER SPEED RIDING OUT BACKWARDS IF YOU SPIN IT REALLY A COMPLETE ONE EIGHTY RATHER THAN SPINNING YOU KNOW HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES OR SO WHERE YOU BASICALLY YOU'RE GOING TO LAND IN A COMPLETE STOP
THIS LEARNING THIS MOTION WILL GET YOU SET UP SO THAT WHEN YOU DO A BIG OLLIE OR CRACK THE FAKIE DISASTER AND LAND YOU'LL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'LL NEED TO DO WHEN YOU ROLL BACK IN AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE TRICKS YOU'LL NEED TO LEARN BEFORE DOING FAKIE OLLIE DISASTER
SO AS THE YOYO FALLS JUST BEFORE IT FALLS IT HITS ONTO THAT STRING AND I LAND THE YOYO LIKE SO
SMOOTHING ALL THAT HERE SO YOU CAN MAKE IT ALL THE LAND
DANCE BACK AND THAT'S LAND TO REHEAT IT AT THE BEAD IS TOO LONG OUT OF THE FLAME IT WILL CRACK
BUT YOU GET A LAND RIGHT HERE
YOU'RE GOING TO RIDE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP AND AS YOU REACH THE CLIMAX YOU'LL PULL AROUND INTO A FRONT TUCK STAY IN THAT TUCK POSITION UNTIL YOU LAND
IT JUST NEEDS TO BE BIGGER LAND THE PITCHER EYE
YOU WANT TO SET UP YOUR UPPER BODY TO ALREADY ALMOST BE WHERE YOU WANT TO LAND IN THE TRICK
WHENEVER BRANCHES LAND ON THE SCREEN ENCLOSURE I KNOW THERE'S A BRANCH ON THAT SECTION SO WE'LL HAVE TO KEEP A WATCH FLY OUT FOR ANY TEARS OR ANY ANY REPAIRS THEM I NEED TO BE DONE TO THE POOL ENCLOSURE
SO TOE ON THE FLOOR YOU'RE GOING TO JUMP OVER YOUR RIGHT FOOT OKAY AND LAND IN FRONT OF IT
AGAIN GIVING A MORE OF A PROBABLY TO LAND ON THAT SIDE
I PREFER THE FRONT LAND LOOK BROUGHT BRAND FRONTLINE BRAND THAT YOU WORK THE BEST IN MY OPINION OVER THE YEARS OR THEY THEY CAUSE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF EFFECT THAT I HAVE EVER HAD ANY BAD REACTIONS ON THE FRONT LINE
AS I LAND MY WEIGHT STILL COMES HERE I SHIFT FORWARD INTO THE PUNCH AND THEN AS I PLANT THE ARM BACK I THROW THE RIGHT LEG OUT
I LAND FROM HERE
LAND IN A MANUAL
NOLLIE HALF CAB KICK FLIP IS WHEN YOU RIDE IN THE NOLLIE POSITION NOLLIE <UNK> FLIP FRONTSIDE AND LAND FAKIE AND KEEP ROLLING
AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS HIT THE NOSE YOUR FOOT IS GOING TO CONTINUE UP THE BOARD AND FLIP THE BOARD ONE EIGHTY AND LAND IN THE FAKIE POSITION
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET TOO CLOSE TO THE LEDGE BECAUSE CLOSE YOU GET THE MORE ON EVEN YOUR BOARD'S GOING TO TAKE OFF IN THE MORNING WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO LAND
THIS SAYS BASIC LAND FOREST AND IT'S ONE OF THE SIMPLEST CARDS IN TERMS OF TYPE
CARDS ALL FALL UNDER TO CATEGORIES LAND OR SPELLS
ANYTHING THAT'S NOT A LAND IS IT'S SIMPLY DISPEL EVEN IF IT BECOMES SOMETHING ELSE AFTERWARDS
THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARDS ARE LAND CREATURE ARTIFACT ENCHANTMENT SORCERY INSTANT TRIBAL AND PLANES WALKER
DRILL DOWN AND YOU THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY ADD SOME SOME LEAD WEIGHTS INTO THE DICE TO BE MORE THE MORE LIKELY TO LOOK TO LAND ON THAT SIDE
WE'RE GOING TO LAND IT INSTEAD OF THE BALL OF YOUR FEET YOUR HEELS
LAND AND ROLL AWAY STRAIGHT
AFTER YOU'VE OLLIED OVER THE BEGINNING OF THE LEDGE YOU WANT TO GO OVER THE TOP LAND ON TOP OF THE LEDGE PUTTING ALL THE PRESSURE RIGHT HERE AND HANGING YOUR NOSE JUST OVER THE TIP OF THE LEDGE ITSELF
FRONT SIDE NOSE SLIDE IS WHEN YOU OLLIE OVER A LEDGE ROLLING UP TO IT IN THE FRONT SIDE POSITION AND LAND ONLY ON YOUR NOSE AND YOUR TWO FRONT WHEELS SLIDE ACROSS THE TOP AND THEN POP OUT STRAIGHT AND ROLL AWAY
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS SET UP IN THE OLLIE POSITION WITH YOUR FEET READY TO CREEP UP INTO THE NOSE POSITION IN THE AIR SO THAT YOU CAN LAND IN THE NOSE ONE SLIDE
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE ONE THING I MIGHT COUSIN BETTY IS A BIRDWATCHER SO I LAND A PAINTING LITTLE BIRDS ALL AROUND AND BECAUSE THE HERITAGE ON BOTH SIDES WAS OF FROM ITALIAN FROM ITALY I PUT A MAP OF ITALY ON THERE
ALSO THIS DESTROYS TARGET LAND DOES NOT SAY BASIC LINE SO THAT THERE'S A LAND THAT'S ACTING AS A MAN A BATTERY OR A LAND THAT PRODUCES MORE THAN ONE COLOR YOU CAN BASICALLY DESTROY THEIR WHOLE DECK IDEA BY JUST DRAWING THAT LAND ON TURN THREE
THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO DO THAT BEFORE YOU OLLIE AND AFTER YOU OLLIE WHEN YOU LAND
YOU COULD DO IT OFF FROM A CURVE AND THEN LAND IN A SAFE POSITION
BUT IN AMERICA WE CALL A GREEN LAND
THAT PROBABLY SETS HOW YOU WILL BE IN THE AIR AND HOW YOU WILL BE WHEN YOU LAND
BUT TO SUCK UP YOUR KNEES WHEN THEY'RE IN THE AIR THAT WAY THE LEG IS COMING UP YOU CAN POSITION YOU WANT TO LAND
SO TECHNICALLY SPEAKING WHEN YOU LAND OR YOU TRY TO RIDE UP WHEN IT'S GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO DO SO IN A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT PATTERN
OH FROGS EVEN IS TADPOLES WILL EAT SIBLINGS AND AS THEY NOW THE MORE PRECISE TO GET ON LAND IT PRETTY MUCH PLEAT ANYTHING SMALL ENOUGH TO GET YOUR MOUTH
THESE BURNERS ACTUALLY COME ALL THE BOTTOMS OF LAND TURN
YOU'LL SET UP YOUR FEET A LITTLE BIT WITH YOUR TOES WITH YOUR TOE HANGING OFF THE FRONT AND THIS IS A IN ANTICIPATION OF YOUR FOOT TRAVELING AND SETTING UP IN SO THAT YOU LAND IN A GOOD ROLLING POSITION
WHAT IS THE RECORD LAND
KEEP YOUR ARMS ARE LEFT WITH JUST THE FLY UP OVER YOUR HEAD AND WHAT THEY LAND THIS TIME
NOW THIS THAT THIS WOULD BE PUT IN THE DECK MADE FOR HEAVY LAND THE STEPS OF THE EYE
HOWEVER THIS CARD DOES IS IT DESTROYS GET LAND
ONCE AGAIN WITHOUT A LAND THAT MEANS THAT PERSON HAS TO PLAY ANOTHER LAND BUT ALSO MEANS THAT THEY DON'T GET THAT MANNA
GET YOUR SHOULDERS AND THEN IN THE POSITION THAT YOU WANT TO LAND IN AND FRONT SIDE WITH A AND ROLL AWAY FAKIE
JUST BEFORE YOU GET TO THE END THAT SUGGEST ABOUT SIX INCHES TO A FOOT BEFORE THE AND YOU GET YOUR SHOULDERS ADJUSTED AND THEN FRONT SIDE <UNK> OUT AND LAND FAKIE AND ROLL AWAY
HERE I HAVE A KNOB WHICH IS CALLED ELECTRONICS LAND THE POTENTIALLY ON THERE
THE AREA CLOSEST TO YOU IS AIRED FOR LOOK AND LAND MANNA
NINE OF MY TWELVE TEAMMATES IN AND LAND A GEORGE AND THE NINETY NINETY SIX PARALYMPIC GAMES PUSH THEIR WHEELCHAIRS IN THE GYM AND THEN SAT IN IT
SO THE PROCESS WAS I START AT THE DEFENSE AND HEAD AND BOX BLADE ON THE BACK OF MY TRACTOR AND PULL THAT AND TRY TO SMOOTH OUT AS MUCH AS I COULD BE AND I JUST TRY TO FOLLOW THE CONTOUR THE LAND
WE WANT TO PUT A HOME SIDE ON HERE SO WE NEED IS SOME WAY TO GET HEAVY CORRECTION EQUIPMENT ONTO THE LAND ON THIS VERY RED CLAY GUMBO SOIL THAT IT'S THE VERY EASY TO GET STUCK IN
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO THROW THAT BALL UP IN OUR WORK AND HAVE IT LAND IN THIS HAND WITHOUT THAT MUCH TROUBLE
YOU POP IT AND YOU TRAVEL AND LEAN A LITTLE MORE FORWARD AND THEN YOU LAND IS NICE AND CLEAN AND ROLL AWAY FAKIE AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO A FAKIE OLLIE
A LOT OF YOUR LAND TURTLES LIKE YOUR BOX TURTLES FULLY THEREFORE LOOSELY CRICKETS
IT'S ALMOST FLOATING BY YOU YOU GRAB THEM BY THE PFD LOOKING THEIR FACE IN YOUR SHOT THAT I'M GOING TO SAVE YOU YOUR FORWARD OR BACKWARDS THEY LAND ON TOP OF YOU
IT'S AN OLD BELT FROM NOT A LAND AND NOT TO LAND
WHEN YOU'RE ON LAND ARE BREATHING IS COMFORTABLY AS WE WISH TO
