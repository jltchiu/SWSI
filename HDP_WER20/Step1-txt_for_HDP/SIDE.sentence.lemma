I'M USING TWO CUPS OF RICE AND THAT'S WHY I'M DOING IT SOMETIMES WHAT I DO IS I SAID A LITTLE BIT MORE SIDE JUST IN CASE AS SPILL IT OR ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENS
SAME THING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS TAKE YOUR HAND STRAIGHT DOWN OUR SIDE RIGHT OUTSIDE OF OUR HIP
ONCE AGAIN THE WATER GOING BACK IN THE OCEAN IS GOING TO CREATE A LITTLE RIVER THAT IS FLOWING ALONG THE SIDE OF THE WAVE WHICH IS THE SIDE OF THE SAND BAR
OKAY IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE A COVER REMOVING THE DRIVER SIDE FRONT AND REAR OUR INNER DOOR INSERTS
IF YOU'LL LOOK AT INJURED ON BOTH THEN YOU'LL SEE HOW IT OVERLAPS THE TWO PLASTIC PARTS ON EITHER SIDE
RIGHT THERE AND GET A REALLY GOOD LOOK AT THIS ONE ON THIS SIDE
AND I'LL SHOW YOU ON THIS SIDE
THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FROM THE SIDE SO YOU CAN SEE IT COMING OUT FROM THE FRONT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE ACTUALLY BENDING THIS BOOM
SO JUST CUT UP TO THE SIDE AND THEN CUT IT TAKE MY RIB LIKES WON'T FIT FOR ALL THE WAY ACROSS
SO HER RIGHT KNEE IS UP CRANE OUR RIGHT ARM IS AND ROLLING BLOCK AND LEFT HAND IS OUT TO THE SIDE
WE'LL TRY THE OTHER SIDE JUST SO THAT WE'RE SURE THAT WE WERE CLEAR IN OUR DEMONSTRATION
EACH UP THIS SIDE OF THE DRY CLEANING MACHINE AND ADD A STEAM CLEAN THAT SPOT ON IT AND I TOOK IT OFF THE HANGER SO IT WOULD NOT STRETCH
WHEN YOU TAKE THEM OUT OF THE DRY ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE INSIDE OUT CAUSE YOU WASH THEM INSIDE OUT TO RETAIN THE COLOR SUIT TURN THOSE RIGHT SIDE IN THE RIGHT SIDE OUT
FOLD THE ONE SIDE IN
IF YOU'RE MORE ADVANCED MAKE SURE YOU GET EQUALS OPTICAL AMOUNT ON EACH SIDE
IMPORTANT THINGS ON ITS SIDE LUNGES IS THE FEET STAY STRAIGHT AHEAD
WHETHER IT'S THE TRIM ON THE SIDE OF THE CAR OR EVEN THE LETTERS YOU KNOW YOU CAN REALLY MAKE CRAWL LOOK GREAT
THEN ON AN INHALE SHE IS GOING TO REACH BOTH KNEES BACK UP AND THEN EXHALE SHE'S GOING TO REACH THE KNEES OUT TO HER OTHER SIDE
THIS EXERCISE IS CALLED THE SIDE PLANK AND THIS IS A GREAT EXERCISE THAT WE'VE ADOPTED FROM YOGA SO WE'RE GOING TO INCORPORATE THE CORE AND WE'RE GOING TO WORK OUT OF BALANCE STABILITY STRENGTH ALL THAT GREAT STUFF THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IS NICE AND TALL IN OUR POSTURE SO YOU WANT TO COME TO YOUR STAIRS AND JUST PLACE YOUR HAND ON ONE OF THE STEPS AND KIND OF WALK YOUR FEET OUT AND YOU WANT TO LIFT THROUGH YOUR TORSO HERE EXTEND YOUR TOP ARM UP TOWARDS THE CEILING AND JUST HOLD THIS POSITION AND YOU CAN HOLD THIS POSITION FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS TO A MINUTE
IF YOU NEED TO MODIFY JUST LOWER DOWN ONE KNEE AND SIDE PLANK HERE
YOU CAN PERFORM THIS POSE FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS TO A MINUTE AND THEN SIMPLY SWITCH SIDES AND THAT IS YOUR SIDE PLANK AND WORK THAT CORE
I'M GOING TO LAY THE LEADING EDGE OF THE GLIDER IN A NICE HARD FROM ONE SIDE AND THE SAME THING ON THE OTHER SIDE
WE'RE NOW READY TO MOVE ON THE TRACK SIDE AND MAINTENANCE OF WAY STRUCTURES
MY NAME IS KEVIN BLAKENEY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND IT'S NOW TIME TO ADD MAINTENANCE AWAY STRUCTURES TO YOUR TRACK SIDE ON YOUR MODEL RAILROAD VILLAGE
WHOEVER HAS THE MOST OF SCARE AUGHT SIDE OF THE WHOLE GROUPS GOING A BOAT ON AND THEY'RE GOING TO GET SOME EXTRA BONUS POINT
YOUR KNEELING HANDS GET PLACED ON THE BALL KIND OF LIKE A KARATE CHOP I'M GOING TO PUSH THE BALL OUT BENDING AT THE HIPS AND THEN USING THE ELBOWS TO DRIVE THE BALL IN TO THE SIDE AND BACK UP
THIS EXERCISE IS GOING TO TARGET THE WITH THIS IN A STORE SIDE WHICH IS THE LARGE MUSCLE ALONG SIDE THE BACK
SO THE ABDOMINALS ARE IN TIGHT AND I PULL THE ELBOWS TOWARDS THE SIDE
BECAUSE IT JUST SIMPLY YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BE CUTTING A SLOT THAT EACH SIDE OF A LINE
THESE ARE USED EITHER FOR DECORATIVE PURPOSE IS OR AS A MEANS OF STARTING THE MARKING EACH SIDE OF THE BEAD
AGAIN YOU START UP FROM ONE SIDE LOWER THE TOOL DOWN JUST TO GIVE YOU A SLIGHT MARK FOR THEN GO IN AND WHITE IN THE CUT TO THE SIDE
BRING IT DOWN UNTIL YOU MAKE A MARK AND THEN GO TAKE EACH SIDE OF THAT MARK I FOR AND WHITE IN THE CUT
FROM THE SIDE INTO
SAME THING I'M GOING TO GO TO THE RIGHT SIDE
NOW JUST LIKE YOU WERE WE'RE PUTTING YOUR HANDS IN THE HOOP YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK FOR THAT OPENING TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HOOP
AND THEN RELEASE TO THE FLOOR AND TURN THE HEAD TO ONE SIDE AGAIN RESTING
THIS IS GREAT TO STRENGTHEN THE WHOLE DIRECTOR SPINE THE MUSCLES THAT ARE LENGTHEN UP OR DOWN THE SIDE OF THE SPINE
SO WHEN YOU GET THIS SIDE AND NOW SEE YOU HAVE ABOUT A TWO INCH OVER HANG THERE
AND THEN PIN THAT SIDE IN
LITTLE FLAKE WILL COME OFF THE BACK SIDE
THE THREE AND A FOUR YOU HAVE AND NOW FIVE AND SIX YOU'RE GOING TO DO TO FLAT SIDE BY SIDE AND A SEVEN
SO WE HAVE TO DO IS USE THE PORTALS QUICKLY IN SUCCESSION TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE
NOW IT SHOULD TURN FROM GREEN ALONG THE SIDE OF THE WAND SHOULD GO FROM GREEN TO READ IF IT'S REAL IF IT AND IT SHOULD BE
NOW OFF TO THE SIDE HERE AND YOU WANT TO DRIVE TO NICKEL SIZE CIRCLES AS WELL
NOT SIDE SIDE
SO WE LEARN FOR BASIC KICKS FRONT KICK SIDE KICK BACK KICK AND ROUND HOUSE KICK
SO SOME VARIATIONS ART YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOU HAD A CRESCENT KICK WITH THE KICK COMES OUT AND IT COMES OUT SLAPPING ON THE SIDE SIDE OF THE HEAD
THEN YOU JUST GO AHEAD AND LEAN TO ONE SIDE
AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE PEELING YOUR SHRIMP YOU WANT TO TURN THEM OVER AND LOOK AT THIS BACK SIDE
SOME PEOPLE WILL START WITH ONE SIDE AND THEN MOVE OVER AND TAKE THE OTHER SIDE
AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO IS I KICK TO THE SIDE
TWO IN ONE HAND SIDE BY SIDE TOO AND THE OTHER HAND
THESE WE HAVE ON SIDE FOR SO THAT YOU CAN HOLD ON WHEN YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE WOODS AND HAVE THEM UP FRONT
THEY'RE GOING TO GO SLOW AND I'LL SHOW YOU COVER THEM OVER THEM A LITTLE BIT ME ON SIDE POSITION YOU CAN FINISH WITH PUNCH
ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE YOU'LL SEE THEY BE A QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE
AND THESE ARE THE AREAS OF LIGHT THAT SWING FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND GO UP AND DOWN
LET IT IN HERE I'M JUST GOING TO WALK MY FEET OUT TOWARDS THE DIRECTION OF GOING TO LOOK AT THE TIGHT CHOKE IS JUST TO THIS SIDE HERE
AND WHEN I'M DONE WITH THAT SIDE ALL STAY THERE FOR A COUPLE MINUTES BUT WHEN I'M DONE I'LL LET GO RELEASE MY HEAD UP MY ARM OUT AROUND TO COMING BACK DOWN
AS YOU DRY YOUR HAIR AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO SIMPLY DO IT THE EXACT SAME WAY YOU WOULD AND HOW YOU WANT TO STYLE IT TO SIDE SWEEP IT OR ANYTHING ELSE AND YOU WOULD STRAIGHTEN IT AND EXACTLY HOW YOU LIKE
IT MAY NOT ACTUALLY GO FLAT AND SO YOU GOT ON THE ROAD AND ACTUALLY HAS SOME SOME SERIOUS PRESSURE UNDER IT AND THEN YOU'LL END UP FIX ANOTHER FLAT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THAT'S NEVER GOOD
WE WANT TO KEEP BOTH SIDE HERE
WE DON'T WANT TO TWIST TO THE SIDE TO LOAD THE DOMINANT SIDE
BASICALLY ALL YOU WANT TO DO ON YOUR WIRE IS YOU'RE GOING TO GET UTILITY KNIFE AND THIS IS A LITTLE TRICKY BUT I HAVE TO DO IS PUT ONE SIDE OF THE BLADE MAKES YOUR WIRE PUT YOUR THUMB ACROSS THE BLADE AND IN A CIRCULAR MOTION RUN THE BLADE IN A CIRCLE
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE CONCAVE THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY JUST TURN IT TO THE SIDE AND GET THEM AT ALL BECAUSE THE BOTTOMS OF NOT THERE
SO YOU HAVE TO TURN AND BLOCK LITTLE TO THE SIDE TO FIT INSIDE THE SHAPE OF THE CONCAVE
IT CAN BE ALL PORCELAIN FOR GREATER AESTHETICS POWER CAN BE ALL METAL IN EARRINGS WORD NOTHING ELSE THAT SIDE
IF THEY DON'T WORK SO WELL THEY WERE THEY DON'T WORK SO WELL WITH THE THESE KIND OF LIGHTS BECAUSE THE YOU WOULD JUST THEM ON THE SIDE
HERE I LET THE ARM REST ON THE TABLE AND WORK THE FRONT SIDE OF IT OR THE BICEP
NOW PALM OPEN YOUR HANDS UP ALL THE FINGERS TOUCH THUMB TOUCHES EACH SIDE OF YOUR FINGERS
I MEAN IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE EQUAL JUST ON EACH SIDE OF THE LINES
NOW THE OTHER SIDE
FIRST STEP TO THE SIDE AND TOUCH OUR FOOT TO THE GROUND
WE'RE GOING TO RUN HIM FROM SIDE TO SIDE GOING TO RUN HIM OFF SOME SCREENS ALLOW HIM TO COME UP IN THE HIGH POST AREA SHOOT AS WELL
ONCE HE MAKES IT THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE AT THAT POINT IT'S VERY CRITICAL THAT YOU REALLY MAKING FEEL GOOD ABOUT HIS VICTORY
NOW AS YOU'RE COMING TOWARDS THE PLATE YOU WANT YOUR MOMENTUM TO BE FULLY ON YOUR FRONT SIDE NORMALLY ON YOUR SHOULDERS AND EVERYTHING AS IF YOU WERE FALLING FORWARD
SO YOU CAN EMBOSS PATTERNS ON TO THE PLATE AND THEY'LL SHOW UP ON THE OTHER SIDE SO THAT WHEN YOU'RE USING THE IRON WITH THE WAX AND YOU'RE LAYING IT DOWN AND PICKING IT UP YOU'RE GETTING THIS LITTLE PATTERN TRANSFERRED ONTO THE WAX
APPLYING A SIDE MOTION WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SQUIGGLE SO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PIGMENT IS MAKING GOOD CONTACT WITH THE CANVAS
IT LOOKS LIKE ALMOST A DOUBLE FAN AND THAT IS THE WINGS OF OUR DRAGON AND YOU'LL PUT A FAIR AMOUNT OF GLUE PUT IT FROM FROM THE HALFWAY THROUGH ONE ALL THE WAY DOWN THE SIDE LIKE THIS
YOU'RE GOING TO SPREAD THIS BLUE LAYER ALL THROUGHOUT THE SKY AREA USING A SIDE TO SIDE MOTION AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU GET PLENTY OF PIGMENT
WE DON'T WANT TO USE IN THE ENGLISH SQUIRT CUE BALL OFF ONE SIDE OF THE OTHER
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO CHOOSE YOUR SETTINGS TABS ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE
YOU WANT TO SLITS AND WE'VE ONE SIDE OF THE SCARF BEFORE YOU DO THE OTHER SIDE SO THAT YOUR HOLES DON'T SHIFT WHILE YOU'RE WORKING ON ANOTHER SIDE
USUALLY YOU POINT THE LIGHT INTO THE REFLECTIVE SIDE AND IT ACTUALLY WORKS IS A REALLY NICE SOFT BOX
AND SO RIGHT NOW THIS TABLE IF YOU LOOK THE WORDS DON'T BUMP ALL THE WAY UP AGAINST THE LEFT HAND SIDE
I SPRAY TO THE BACK OF THE PIECE OF PAPER TO HAVE MY PATTERN ON THE OTHER SIDE AND I STICK IT ON THE STEEL SO THAT STUCK ON THERE PRETTY GOOD
STAND UP I'M GOING TO TWIST FORWARD I'M GOING TO TURN AROUND SO THAT YOU CAN SEE FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE AS WELL
ALSO YOU CAN SIDE STEP SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS JUST FOCUS ON THIS AT HOME IS JUST HAVING AREA OF YOUR HOUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE A CHORD JUST DO THIS MOVEMENT YOU WILL DO THE FOUR STEP THREE STEPS OF THE TWO STEP AND YOU'LL NOTICE WE START COVER IN THIS AREA VERY EFFICIENTLY AND THAT'S REALLY THE KEY TO A GOOD GAME SO WORK YOUR STEPS BREAK THE GAME DOWN INTO THE SIDE A LITTLE BITE SIZE CHUNKS AND YOU'LL SEE THE MOVEMENT SKILLS REALLY IMPROVE
YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT TO THE OTHER SIDE KEEPING THE BELLY BUTTON ALWAYS STEADY FACING FRONT KEEPING THAT TUCK
IN THIS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE I HAVE THE GRIP AND BRAKE LEVER ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HANDLE BAR I HAVE SOMETHING TO WORK WITH
I JUST SHOWED YOU HOW TO ANCHOR YOURSELF I COULD ANCHOR MYSELF HERE AND DO SOME KNEE LIDS EXTENSION STRAIGHT OUT TO THE SIDE
SAME THING ON THIS SIDE FROM THE TOP POINT TO THIS POINT FOLD IT DOWN
GREAT TECHNIQUE STRIKES WITH THE HEEL THAT'S BACK LEG SIDE KICK
SO AS I'M DOING THIS TECHNIQUE ON PROTECTED AGAINST A POTENTIAL COUNTERATTACKED I KEEP MY ELBOW IN THE CENTER SO FROM HERE STRAIGHT THROUGH BOOM BACK LEG SIDE KICK
AS THIS LEG IS COMING THROUGH A WILL TAKE THIS FORM AND LEAD WITH BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET HIT THE STOMACH WITH HIS SIDE KICK ALL THE WAY IN
SHOULDERS RELAX THE SHOULDERS AND COME ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE BACK LEG SIDE KICK
THE SPEED THE CAPTIVE BEAD RING BUT SINCE I'VE DISCOVERED THAT IT DOESN'T MOVE FROM SIDE TO SIDE AS MUCH AND IT'S NOT AS MUCH IRRITATION
FROM THERE LIFTING UP GRAB THAT ANKLE ONE SIDE ALL THAT FOR FIFTEEN SECONDS
I'M JUST GOING TO REACH UP CLASPING THE HANDS TILTED TO ONE SIDE REACH THE STRETCHING OUT MY LETS THE OTHER SO IT
YOU WANT TO HAVE A MAIN LIGHT SHOULD JUST TO ONE SIDE OF THE MODEL'S FACE THEN YOU WANT TO EITHER HAVE A SECOND LIGHT OR A BIG WHITE BOUNCE CARD TO BOUNCE A LIGHT BACK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MODEL SPACE
IF YOUR LEFT HAND OR YOU MAY WANT TO START ON THE LEFT SIDE AS IT'S PROBABLY EASIER TO WORK LEFT TO RIGHT FOR YOU GUESS
PLACE MY COMB IN THE SIDE OF THE HEAD OR THE SIDE BACK OF THE HEAD AND SEE WHERE THE COMB STARTS TO COME OFF OF THE HEAD FORM
MOVE OVER TO THE NEXT SECTION IN MIRROR THE LINE THAT I CREATED ON THE RIGHT SIDE FOR THE LEFT SIDE
LIKE I WILL ACTUALLY SLIP JUST SLIGHTLY THROUGH MY FINGERS AND I'LL BE ABLE TO GET THAT HERE ON THE LEFT SIDE
SINCE I'M RIGHT HANDED AND I WORK RIGHT TO LEFT I GO BACK TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND CREATE ANOTHER HORIZONTAL LINE SO SECTIONING MY RIGHT BACK SECTION
SO JUST GIVE IT A LITTLE CRUNCH FROM THE CORE AND THEN TWIST OVER TO THE SIDE
WE'RE GOING TO REPEAT THAT ON THE OTHER SIDE LIKE SO
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAYBE SOMETIMES THEY CAN DRIBBLE TO THE SIDE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR TO SHOT FAKE AND THEN SHOOT
COMES OVER AND THE STRING AS IT DOES THIS IS GOING TO WITH AROUND THE SIDE OF YOUR WRIST
SO WHEN YOU BUY BEND IT UP YOU SHOULD HAVE IT FOLDED AND SIDE THAT CREASE
SAME THING ON THIS SIDE MAKING SURE THE POINTS MEAT POINT
AND SUDDENLY LAYERS FOLD THAT POINT THAT WE JUST MADE AND SAME THING ON THIS SIDE INSIDE REVERSE FOLD THAT POINT
IT'S GOING TO BE ON THE LEFT SIDE
SO TO TAKE THIS THING OFF WE'RE GOING TO DO IS THERE'S A BUTTON ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CAMERA IF IF YOU'RE FACING THE BACK OF THE CAMERA
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO COME INTO PLAY WHEN YOU'RE THINKING IN TERMS OF LETTER SIZES OR HOW LONG THE WORD IS GOING TO BE BECAUSE THAT'S TAKING YOU WAY INTO THE DIGITAL SIDE OF YOUR BRAIN AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THERE
AND YOU WANT TO USE JUST A FEW LITTLE THREADS FROM YOUR PANTS SO IT DOESN'T SHOW ON THE OTHER SIDE
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT FROM THE OTHER SIDE YOU'RE NOT SAYING ANY OF THE STITCHING
AND I'VE ALREADY SET THE SOFTWARE THE STOP DOWN HERE IT'S EIGHTEEN INCHES FROM THE SIDE OF THE PLAY
SO IF MY TEAM WHICH IS SERVE THE BALL AND WE GET IT IN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CHORD WE GET IN THE SQUARE IN THE ON THE GROUND WE GET A POINT
THE FIRST WAY IS CALLED TRADITIONAL OR SIDE OUT SCORING
TYPICALLY IN TRADITIONAL OUR SIDE OUT SCORING THE GAMES GO TO FIFTEEN OR A LOT OF IN
AND THEN STARTING WITH THE LARGEST PEDAL YOU WANT TO TAKE THE TWO FLAPS ON THE EITHER SIDE OF THAT SLICE AND FOLD IT OVER LIKE THIS
THEN WHAT YOUR WEIGHT IN YOUR MOMENTUM CARRY YOUR BACK OVER AND YOU'LL GO FAKIE DOWN THE OTHER SIDE THAT'S FOR YOUR FAKIE SKILLS COME INTO PLAY
OKAY THIS IS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DECK AND AGAIN WE HAVE A SPONGY ROTTED TO BY SIX REDWOOD HERE AND A LOT OF TIMES YOU CAN JUST CUT OUT A FOUR FOOT SECTION AND REPLACE WORDS IT'S BAD AND OF COURSE SCREW THAT DOWN
SO AGAIN STARTING IN NEUTRAL NICE SOFT HAS BEEN CALLED IN TIGHT ARMS DOWN BY YOUR SIDE
SO YOU CAN DO IT TO ONE SIDE YOU COME BACK IN NEUTRAL AND GO TO THE OTHER SIDE
I'M GOING TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN AND YOU START TO MOVE BOTH YOUR ARMS OVER TOWARDS THE RIGHT SIDE PALMS ARE GOING TO FACE FORWARD TURNING THE SPINE THE WAIST COMING DOWN BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE
THERE'S EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL SIDE
IF YOU HAVE A LOCAL TRAVEL ON CLUB IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A LAKE WHEN YOU'RE AT THE BEACH PUT ON YOUR WETSUIT GET OUT THERE AND FEEL THAT FEELING OF THAT WATER HIT NIA AND EITHER DRIVING THROUGH THE WAVES AND BREAK INTO THE OTHER SIDE OR JUST ROLLING WITH IT AND GET COMFORTABLE WITH IT
OKAY IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO COVER REMOVING THE DRIVER SIDE SEATBELT FASTENERS AND BASICALLY THERE FASTEN WITH TWO BOLTS AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE A SEVENTEEN MILLIMETER HEAD
FOR ANGLE LIVE I'LL SHOW YOU ON THE PASSENGER SIDE IT GIVES A LITTLE BIT BETTER VIEW FROM OUR A CURVE FILMING LOCATION
ONE WAY TO TRANSITION FROM RIGHT SIDE TO THE LEFT SIDE
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TILT THE STAFF TO ANGLE SO THEY SMASH UP THIS WAY NATURALLY THE STAFF DIVERTS DOWN TO THE SIDE AND FROM HERE YOU GO IN WITH WHATEVER TECHNIQUE YOU WANT TO USE SO ONCE AGAIN ONE FROM THE ANGLE TO STRAIGHT DOWN TILL
THIS LOOKS LIKE A PASTE IT HANGS ON THE LEFT SIDE THE LONG PAR
HAMMER STRIKE ONE FOAM THIS HAND GOES OUT TO THE SIDE OPPOSITE HAND COMES FORWARD OVERHEAD BEND THE ELBOW
GOOD WRIST STRAIGHT ARMS BACK DOWN THIS WAY RELAXED HERE TO THE SIDE
BOTH ARMS RELAX DOWN BY YOUR SIDE DROPPING THIS ONE
IT'S A MAIN DISH THAT WE CAN SERVE WITH WHATEVER KIND OF SIDE DISH IS WE WANT
SO YOU HAVE TO USE A HIGH DECELERATED NITROGEN LIKE AN EIGHTEEN SIX TWELVE NINETEEN FIVE NINE OR TWENTY ONE SEVEN FOURTEEN EVERY TWO TO THREE WEEKS THROUGHOUT THE GROWING SEASON JUST PUT IT ON THE SIDE OF THE PLANT AND WATERED IN REAL WELL
SO THAT'S THE PROPER WAY TO PERFORM THE LEANING SIDE KICK
BUT AGAIN LET YOUR HANDS RELAX BY YOUR SIDE
SO OUR NEXT STRETCH IS GOING TO BE CALLED SIDE TO SIDE
I'M GOING TO REACH UP AND OVER ON THE LATERAL SIDE
TO REACH UP AND OVER TOWARDS YOUR RIGHT SIDE
AND NOW WE'RE BOUNCING STEM AND HIP LITTLE JUMP SIDE
FROM THE SIDE KNEES SLIGHTLY BENT THE START WITH AND LIFT LIFT JUST BY STRAIGHTEN THAT KNEE
I COULD ALSO TAKE DIFFERENT I COULD ADD PLUG INS REMOVED PLUG INS AND SIDE CHAIN DIFFERENT PLUGINS DEPENDING ON WHERE A MAT
THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO ACTUALLY LEAN FORWARD AND REACH FOR YOUR TOE UP UNTIL IT'S FOR WITH YOUR HAND THAT'S WHAT'S ON THE SAME SIDE
HI MY NAME IS DAN SCHMIDT FROM THE CHINESE MARTIAL ARTS CENTER AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE SHOWING YOU THE PROPERLY NOISE SIDE KICK
SAME THING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE BUT POINTING YOUR FINGERS UP GRAB ON TOP AND PULL BACK
OKAY RELAX AND REPEAT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
IF YOU NEED TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR BALANCE YOU CAN EITHER PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE FRONT OR HANDS IN THE SIDE
NOW LET'S GO BACK TO THE SIDE KICK ON COME RIGHT AT YOU WITH THIS AND GET READY
THIS IS THE BACK LEG SIDE KICK
NOW THE USUALLY A USUALLY WHEN COOKING SCHNITZEL SIDE YOU CAN EITHER COOKING IN OIL OR USUALLY THEY COOK THEM AND BUTTER TO BUT I'M CHOOSING OLIVE OIL TODAY BECAUSE IT'S A LOT HEALTHIER
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IF YOU'RE OUTSIDE OF THE LANE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE LANE WHEN YOU'RE UP MORE TOWARDS THE FRONT OF OF THE KEY OF TOWARDS UP HERE YOU DON'T WANT TO USE THE BACKWARDS SHOT
IF YOU WANT TO CUT THE BALL TO THE RIGHT IN YOUR RIGHT HAND A PITCHER YOU WE CUT THE BALL IN HALF AND POSITION BOTH FINGERS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BALL
AND YOU JUST NEED IS TIME CONSUMING USING HAVE PATIENCE AND GO IN EACH LITTLE GROOVE SEPARATELY AND THEN ONCE YOU'VE GOT A BAR REP YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FEEL THE BURR ALONG THE BACK SIDE AND THEN JUST LIKE WITH A STRAIGHT EDGE KNIFE YOU GO BACK TO THE GOOD OLD LEATHER STROP
YOU STROP THE BACK SIDE AND YOU STROP THE SERRATIONS
AND TAKE IT TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE WITH THE LEFT FOOT GOES OUT OF OFF THE SIDES OF THE MAT TAKE THAT KNEE RIGHT DOWN INTO THE MAT
THERE'S A SIDE BALANCE
SO THE VALVE ONE I'M GOING TO CLOSE INTO A MORE TO MY LEGS TO A STRETCH IN MY SPINE MINE STILL MAKE EVERYTHING GOES UP AND RELEASE AND GO UP AND RELEASE AND I'M GOING TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE
THIS IS HOW WE PERFORM OR TRANSITION KICK PUNCH TO SCRAPE BLOCK SIDE PUNCH
COMES ALL THE WAY IN PULLS IN CHAMBER SIDE PUNCH
THEY HAVE THE SIDE AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THE REINS NOW IN YOUR LEFT HAND
NOTICE SHE'S LAYING ON OUR SIDE AND SHE'S RELAXED
NOW ONCE YOU'VE GOT YOUR ACRYLIC APPLY THE LOOK AT IT FROM THE SIDE AND YOU WILL LOOK AT IT FROM THE BOTTOM
IT'S GOING TO SWEEP IT OFF TO THE SIDE
NOW IF YOU WANTED TO ADD AN EXTRA CHALLENGE YOU COULD ACTUALLY REACH OVER TO THE SIDE COME DOWN THE CENTER AND HIT BLUE THE OBLIQUES CROSS BACK TO CENTER FOR JUST STEP IT UP JUST A LITTLE BIT FOR
AND THEN THE FACT THAT IT'S WITH FACING MEANS THAT THIS LINE OF YOUR NECK AND THEN BECOMES THE STITCH LINE FOR AT PEACE MIRRORING THIS TO BE PLACED ON TOP RIGHT SIDE THE RIGHT SIDE STITCHED ALONG THE HEART AND THEN FLIPS IN INSIDE OUT FLIPS INTO THE INTERIOR OF IT AND THEN IRONED ALONG THIS LINE WHICH JUST ALLOWS FOR CLEAN FINISH AND ALLOWS FOR THE SHAPE TO BE RETAIN WITHOUT STRETCHING OUT THE FABRIC
NOW I CHOSE A SIDE PONYTAIL
AND FOR PATRICIA OUT WE'RE GOING TO SHOW HOW TO DO A SLEEK PONYTAIL WITH A LITTLE BIT OF JEWELS ON THE SIDE
NOW I'M GOING TO MAKE THE LITTLE ARMS ON THE SIDE
ON THE FOLD SIDE HERE THIS IS WHERE I'M GOING TO MAKE MY FIRST CUT
YOU CAN EVEN TAKE A BRUSH TO FADE IT WHAT TO WE COULD TAKE THE SIDE OF THIS BRUSH AND IT BLENDS IT REAL NICE
DROP DROP DROP AND THE OTHER SIDE DROP DROP DROP
FROM THE SIDE DROP YOUR KNEE IS GOING TO COME OUT JUST A LITTLE MORE ELEVEN HIT THE DROP
SO AGAIN BRING THE LIFT LIFT LIFT LIFT STRAIGHTENING LEG A LITTLE BIT MORE AND LIFT ON THE OTHER SIDE
FROM FORWARD FACING AGAIN DROP ON THE OTHER SIDE DROP DROP AGAIN JUST FORCING THE KNEE OUT JUST A BIT MORE
THE DIFFERENCE IN A MAN'S CAT WALK OR STYLISH WALK AS WE LIKE TO REFER TO IT IS THAT THEY KEEP THE FEET SIDE BY SIDE
SO YOU NEED TO THIS SIDE HEY WHAT IS IT WORTH WHAT DO I NEED TO MAKE
AND THEY'RE GOING OUT TO THE SIDE
AND I KIND OF JUST USE THE WINDOW OVER HERE TO IT AS A REFERENCE POINT CAUSE THE WINDOWS COMING IN FROM HERE SO I LIKE MY HOW I LIKE TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROOM
AND SO IS WHAT I'M DOING IS ALL THE HIGHLIGHTS IS YOU CAN SEE I'VE PUT ON THE TIRES ARE TO THAT TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROOM
AND THEN WE CAN INHALE OURSELVES BACK INTO FOR DROSTE REPEATING THE POSE ON YOUR OPPOSITE SIDE
FEET SIDE BY SIDE AND WALKING BACK
BRING YOUR FEET HIP DISTANCE APART YOUR HANDS ARE DOWN BY YOUR SIDE AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A NICE INHALE AND EXHALE AND ROCK THAT PELVIS BACK SO THAT THE LOWER BAGS PRESS INTO THE MAT AND FROM THERE KEEP PRESSING THE SPINE INTO THE MAT UNTIL YOU COME ALL THE WAY UP
IT'S ABOUT THE WHOLE PACKAGE WHICH INCLUDES YOUR PACKS AND IT INCLUDES YOUR TRIP EASIEST MUSCLES INCLUDES YOUR THE LAST IS IN THE STORE SIDE WHICH ARE OR ACROSS YOUR SHOULDER BLADES
YOU CAN SWAP BACK AND FORTH EACH SIDE
SO YOU CAN HAVE YOUR CHILD TO STALL AND NOT THE FIVE FORCEFUL THAT NUMBER TWO AND THEN YOU CAN COLLECT ON THE RIGHT INSIDE AND YOUR A CHILD CAN CONNECT COLLECT THESE NUMBERS ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE
I MEAN THAT YOU NOT SEWING YOU KNOW THE FACE TO TOO MUCH TO THE SIDE OF THE HEAD
I ALSO GOES WITH YOUR HAND SIDE IF YOU DON'T WANT THIS FOR TWO OUT AND THEN ON THE VERY NEXT PLAY YOU DO THIS TO ME TO STRIKES RIGHT AWAY YOU GOT TO CONFUSE AGAIN
ALSO YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT IS A GOOD COMMUNICATOR YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CONSISTENT WITH YOUR SIDE
WITH THE WASHERS TO USE THE OTHER SIDE
IF WE WERE HAD BEEN WORKING ON THE RIGHT SIDE THAT WOULD BE AN INHALE
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO FIRST IS CALLED A SIDE
THE TRUTH SIDE HAS JUST MOVING RIGHT TO THE SIDE
SO WE'RE GOING TO DO I'M GOING TO BE SIDE TESTING TO THE RIGHT SO IF YOU'LL NOTICE I'M GOING TO LIFT UP ON MY LEFT TRAIN AND BARELY TELL I CAN SEE THAT HORSE'S EYE ON THE LEFT SIDE I JUST WANT TO BRING THAT NOSE AROUND
IT'S NOT TRUE SIDE PASS BUT IT'S CLOSE
BUT CATS OF SAND SIDE GO GET A LOT OF DISEASES
NEXT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT A PARTICULAR PROBLEMS THAT CAT HAS IN SOME WAYS THAT WE CAN ADJUST THIS KITTY CAT SIDE BEHAVIORS SO THAT THERE AREN'T PROBLEMS ABOVE THE HOME
IN THAT CASE YOU ALSO WANT TO DO THE OTHER SIDE AS WELL SO DO BOTH SHOULDER POINTS
SO WHAT I'M DOING NOW IS GOING TO BRING THE KNEE ACROSS MY BODY AND THRUST IT STRAIGHT INTO YOU AS A BACK LEG SIDE KICK
IT'S THE FIRST PLACE THAT YOU'LL BEGIN TO NOTICE IN BALANCE IS FROM THE RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR BODY TO THE LEFT SIDE OF YOUR BODY THE FRONT SIDE OF YOUR BODY TO THE BACK SIDE OF YOUR BODY
SO ON ONE SIDE YOU'RE GOING DOWN FROM THE TOP DOWN AND THEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE YOU'RE GOING FROM THE BOTTOM UP
I'M GOING TO ENGAGE THE SIDE OF MY OBLIQUE YOU'RE ALWAYS TWISTING INTO THE NEED THAT IS IN FRONT
PLUS IN LIKE WHEN YOU'LL BE HAVING FUN ALL DAY ON THIS SIDE
BECAUSE THEY ARE FINE UNLESS EFFECTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WE'RE TAKING DIFFERENT PROCESSES TO BREW IT WITHOUT THE TOXINS THEIR NORMAL TOXINS THAT COME FROM WARM WHAT THAT REALLY GIVE THESE HALLUCINOGENIC AFFECTS OR SIDE EFFECTS TO THE DRINK
THE LEFT SIDE WILL HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF POSITIVE CASHFLOW ON THE RIGHT SIDE WILL HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF NEGATIVE CASH FLOW
OTHER THINGS FOR THOSE OF YOU INTERESTED IN A SIDE LUNGES WORK THE ABDUCTORS THE INNER THIGH MUSCLES A LOCK
THAT SIDE LINES
AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE I'M GOING TO BE MOVE THIS THIS FLAP IS UNDERNEATH
I TAKE THE ARMS AND I'LL FOLD THEM IN WORD AND I'VE GOT MY HAND IN THERE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO CREATE A BIG CREASE IN THERE OR I'M FOLDING I WANT TO FOLD STRAIGHT AND FLAT AND AS YOU CAN SEE I'M MAKING A LITTLE BIT HAVE OF MARGIN HERE USING HERE'S THE ARMPIT AND THIS WOULD BE YOUR SIDE OR FLANK OF THE SHIRT AND PULLING IT TOWARDS THE MIDDLE THERE AND NOW WHAT I WOULD DO IN THIS CASE WOULD BE TAKE THE TAIL BRING IT UP AGAINST MAKING SURE I'M NOT CREATING NEW CREASES I PULL IT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE COLOR TO THE COLLAR HAS SOMETHING TO PROTECT IT IT'S NOT JUST HANGING OUT THERE IN THE BREEZE BY ITSELF
BASICALLY IF YOU WANT TO DO A SIMPLE PYRAMID YOU'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE TO NORMAL STUNTS SAY WE LEARNED THE GROUP HEEL STRETCH EARLIER GOING HAVE A GIRL ON THE RIGHT SIDE TO HER RIGHT HEEL STRETCH AND ONCE THAT GROUP OVER GOING HAVE ANOTHER GROUT DOING HER LEFT HEEL STRETCH COLOR JOINING IN THE MIDDLE
SO TAKE A MARSHMALLOW AND JUST CUT ABOUT A QUARTER INCH AND THEN CUT IT IN HALF AND THEN YOU CAN TAKE OFF AND CUT IT A QUARTER OR LESS WHATEVER YOU LIKE AND JUST STICK THAT ON THE SIDE
YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RANGE OF MOTION TO GO TO THE SIDE AND YOU CAN ALSO INCORPORATE SOME BICEP CURLS AND TRICEP PRESSES
THE OTHERS ARE DONE WITH FREE WEIGHTS OR DUMBBELLS AND YOU CAN DO SIDE LATERAL RAISES SO STANDING WITH THE FEET HIP DISTANCE APART SOFTEN THE KNEES SHOULDERS BACK AND LIFT YOUR ARMS TO THE SIDE
YOU WANT TO STICK TO THE LIGHTS SIDE TO MAKE YOUR GRID BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT SO YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO SEE THE LINES
WHAT IT CONTAINS THE SIDE OF THE WAYS WE HAVE THE ALCOHOL WIPES IN THE STING RELIEF
AND I'M GOING TO STRIKE IT AND I SHOULD HAVE A LONG BLADE COME OFF IT ON THE BACK SIDE
IT IS POSSIBLE TO INSTALL THE WRONG ONE ON THE WRONG SIDE
SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ON THE BOTTOM SIDE HERE WE'RE GOING TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF HOT GLUE ALL AROUND IT
AND NOW I'M AND WHAT WE DO NOW IS JUST DO SOME CHORD OR IS JUST GET INTO LINES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE SPACE
WE CAN GO AHEAD AND POUR THIS ON HERE I'LL SET THIS TO THE SIDE WHICH WILL KIND OF FLATTEN THIS OUT SO WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO TAKE THIS AND FOLD IT OVER THAT WAY YOU CAN MANIPULATE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH PUSH THIS TO THE SIDE AND WATCH OUT INTO A BIT WARM YOU WOULD NOTICE IF I'M LOOKING AT IT BUT IT IS
IT ALSO WORKS GOOD IF WE'VE GOT A LINEBACKER ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT IS BLITZING AND WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE GETTING TO THE QUARTERBACK QUICK
SAME WITH THE OTHER SIDE
OF COURSE DO THE SAME ON THE OTHER SIDE
WHAT I'M DOING IS I'M PARTING IT AT ABOUT RIGHT ABOUT AND HER EAR LEVEL OVER HERE ON THIS SIDE
YOUR LEFT HAND CHAMBERS STEP THE RIGHT SIDE OPEN THE RIGHT HAND PALM BLOCK
DO YOU STATIONARY GOING TO MOVE SIDE TO SIDE SO YOU'RE NOT REALLY STAYING IN PLACE
I'M GOING TO STEP TO THE SIDE WITH YOUR LEFT FOOT PALM BLOCK
THE LEFT KNEE CAN GO A LITTLE WIDER OUT TO THE SIDE PLACE YOUR FINGERTIPS OUTSIDE YOUR HIPS WITH YOUR INHALATION LENGTHEN YOUR SPINE UP TOWARD THE SKY
FOR INSTANCE WHETHER CAN BE DIFFERENT ON ONE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN THEN ON THE OTHER BUT WITH OUR MOTOR WE CAN FLY INTO ABOVE
SO I LIKE TO MOVE THE HEAD A LITTLE BIT WHILE THEY'RE MOVING TO THE SIDE
FOR BARREL RACING WHAT WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS MOVE THEM THE HEAD AND TO THE SIDE OF THE SAME TIME
IS ELEVEN PLAYERS ON EACH TEAM TO THE SIDE OF THE GAME
IF YOU REALLY DOESN'T WANT TO GO GET A PARTNER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR TO HELP YOU
AND THE THICKNESS OF THE SIDE SEAM
THAT INDICATES THAT THIS IS ONLY FOR THE DRIVER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE
HOW YOU DETERMINE WHICH SIDE OF THE VEHICLE IS IS YOU PICTURE SO SITTING BEHIND THE STEERING WHEEL YOUR LEFT HAND IS GOING TO INDICATE THE LEFT SIDE AND YOUR RIGHT HAND IS GOING TO INDICATE THE RIGHT SIDE
NEXT YOU WANT TO IDENTIFY THE NAIL THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TRIM AND PRESS IT OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT SO THAT SEPARATES FROM THE OTHER NAILS AND YOU WANT TO USE VISUALLY IF YOU CAN SEE THE QUICK GO AWAY FROM IT ON THIS SIDE
SO A COUPLE OF THE WAYS WE CAN DO THAT IS WE BEGIN WITH OUR ARMS LOOSELY BY THE SIDE
ANOTHER VARIATION OF THE MANUAL IS A MANUAL TO FRONT SIDE <UNK> OUT
OLLIE ONTO THE TOP ALL THE MANUAL POSITION AND THEN JUST BEFORE YOU GET TO THE END INSTEAD OF ROLLING STRAIGHT OFF OF A FRONT SIDE <UNK> TO FAKIE IS
IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT TAKING A TINY NEEDLE IN JABBING IT INTO THE SIDE OF YOUR FINGER DROP WHAT REALLY IS OFF PUTTING TO PEOPLE
ONE IS WHEN THIS GUARD PULLS OUT GO AND PLUG YOUR POSITION WHEN HE PULLS OUTSIDE WHEN HE PULLS OUT OF THAT GUARD POSITION THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE A BIG HOLE OPEN ON THIS SIDE
AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO OUR NEXT ONE AND PLACE IT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND THE REASON WHY WE'RE PUTTING IT ON THE EACH OF THE SIDES VERSUS BECAUSE THEN WHEN WE PUT OUR RIBBON ON THE TOP IT'S GOING TO CROSS OVER AND MAKE A NICE CORNER AND I LIKE WHEN CORNERS OR THEIR LOOK ALL LIKE WE'VE PLANTED OUT AND WE HAVE
NOW I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND DO A ROUND HOUSE TO THE SIDE RIGHT HERE BAM
NOW AIMING IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO FOR A SIDE YOU MIGHT HURT YOURSELF IF YOU ACTUALLY HIT IN THE HIP
NOT A TOP AHEAD NOT ON THE BOTTOM THIS IS THE SIDE KICK
I'M GOING TO DO IT WITH A PARTNER WHERE YOU WANT TO DO IS HAVE HEARD OF THE ARMS IS VERY GENTLY WITHOUT HURTING HER GOING TO GO AHEAD AND RUN A SIDE JUST LIKE THAT FOR ANY
NOW ON THE OTHER SIDE WE HAVE IS TOUGHNESS OR IS STRENGTH STORIES POWER DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU WANT TO COLOR
NOW NOTICE MY HANDS ARE NINE OUT TO THE SIDE BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE CORRECT BODY POSITION
ALWAYS ERR ON THE SIDE OF TWO PROFESSIONAL IF YOU'RE IN CERTAIN
AND THIS ONE WE'RE GOING TO DO IS THE OPEN TOE CUT OUT PLATFORM AND THIS BASE HERE THE WHITE IS ACTUALLY A CUT OUT THAT IF YOU WERE TO LOOK THROUGH IT AND YOU SEE WHATEVER THE OTHER SIDE OF IT
SOMETIMES IF THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PINE NEEDLE JUST STICKING IT I MIGHT PUSH IT THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WHEN I'M DONE WITH THIS JOB OF CLEANING THE SCREEN ENCLOSURE I'LL HAVE TO CLEAN THE POOL
ONCE AGAIN MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE GROOVE SIDE BECAUSE IF YOU DO NOT IN YOUR PIECES WILL NOT SLIDE TOGETHER
OKAY SO LET'S TRY IT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH OUR TOE WAY TO PICK IT UP YOU'RE JUST GOING TO JUMP DON'T CHEAT IT BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS GO LIKE THIS AND THAT WOULD NOT OVER THE TOP THAT WAS ACROSS THE SIDE
IN HIGH WIND AREAS WE RECOMMEND THAT ADDITIONAL FASTENERS BE PLAYS THROUGH THE SIDE INTO THE FACIAL
IT'S A WAY OF AVOID A LOT OF TROUBLES IN YOUR WAY AND ALSO GETTING THE BALL IF THE GREEN IS HEAVILY BUNKER DEPENDS ON THE LEFT SIDE THIS IS A WAY OF TRACKING THE BALL TOWARD THE PIN
SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NOW THAT WE'RE GETTING INTO LONGER IRONS AND THEY'RE NOT QUITE AS LOFTED YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GENERATE MORE SIDE SPIN ON IT
SO AGAIN YOU'RE PLACING THE BALL IN FRONT OF YOU ARE PUSHING DOWN THROUGH THE HANDS EXTENDING OUT THROUGH THE HIPS AND THEN DRIVING THE ELBOWS IN TO THE SIDE
SO STRING OF CARS MOVING ALONG SIDE THE HIGHWAY CAN ACTUALLY LOOK JUST LIKE ONE BIG BLUR OF LIGHT COMING ALONG
AGAIN GIVING A MORE OF A PROBABLY TO LAND ON THAT SIDE
SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO PUT A COUPLE SCREWS IN EACH SIDE THAT ARE GOING TO BE AT AN ANGLE CORN DOWNWARD INTO OUR HANDLE
NEXT I'M JUST GOING TO BE DRILLING A PILOT HOLE THROUGH MY SIDE INTO MY HANDLE
AND ANOTHER SCREW ON THE OTHER SIDE SHOULD DO IT
SO WHAT WE DO ON THIS FRONT SIDE ONE EIGHTY BEND DOWN STARS OPENING THEIR SHOULDERS ONCE WE CAN SEE OUR BOARD ARE TIP OF OUR NOSE YOU WANT TO RELEASE WITH YOUR LEGS AND START TURNING YOUR SHOULDER
SO WHEN I DROP MY HANDS I USE THIS MOMENTUM TO BRING MY HIPS TO THE SIDE ALL THE WAY OVER
I ALWAYS REMEMBER SITE WINDOW LIKE TO THE SIDE OKAY
ALRIGHT WE'VE LOOKED AT TEN CONDO WE LOOKED AT FULL COEY WINDOW NOW WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT SIDE YOUR NEEDLE
ONE TWO THREE THREE THIS ARMS GOING ONE TWO THREE NOW YOU'RE BREATHING ON THE OTHER SIDE
NOW USUALLY PUT A LITTLE TICK MARK ON THE SIDE IT'S GOING TO BE CUT AWAY SO I KNOW WHICH LINE WHICH SIDE OF THE LINE TO CUT ON
AND THE SAME GOES FOR THE INSIDE LOOP ON THE CAR AND IF THE TERMINAL THE FEMALE SIDE
YOU CAN EITHER USE A PAPER CUTTER OR I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS SQUARE BY FOLDING IT DIAGONALLY RIGHT TO THE POINT OVER ON THIS SIDE AND MATCH THE EDGES EXACTLY TO HERE AND THEN JUST FOLD THAT RIGHT IN HALF
SO YOU WANT TO THE SIDE
THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO START BECAUSE THEY CAN UTILIZE THE SUPPORT OF SIDE WALKERS EASIER AS WELL AS THEIR LEGS DON'T HAVE TO BE IN THE DOWN POSITION TO BE ABLE TO RIDE
AND I'LL SHOW YOU FROM THE SIDE
NOW THE SWEET SPOT IS WHERE YOU FIND THAT EXACT SPOT WHERE YOU ARE BALANCING OK YOU'RE NOT LEANING TOO FAR FORWARD YOU'RE NOT LEANING TOO FAR BACK O.K OR TO THE SIDE OR THE OTHER SIDE
YOU KNOW YOU CAN ADD IT INTO YOUR FORMS OR INTO YOUR CAUSE OR ANYTHING THAT YOU MAKE UP IS A JUST TO TAKE THE BEST THAT SPIN AROUND AND TAKE ONE HAND OFF CATCH ON THE OTHER SIDE AND JUST CONTINUE TO FLIP THE LEFT OR RIGHT HAND WHICH EVER YOU START OUT WITH
OF COURSE IS ASKING US TO RESTART THE COMPUTER BUT AS YOU NOTICE THE TEXT ON THE DESKTOP OVER HERE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY
A WIRE IS GOING TO COME OUT OF THE SIDE AND WE'RE GOING TO ATTACH THE WIRE TO A CLOSURE
REALLY CAN FIND THIS STROKE TO THAT AREA DON'T MOVE FURTHER DOWN THE HORSE'S BACK OR ONTO THE HORSE'S SIDE I'M THEY'RE NOT GOING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT YOU'RE DOING UNTIL THERE FULLY WARMED UP
AND IF IT ALL MY MY MY IT MY VANILLA WAFERS INSIDE OF THE BOTTLE AND THEM THE GENIUS THAT I AM AND IDEA I GUESS I GUESS THE EXPERIENCE IN THE AND THE HANDS ON REALLY TEACHES US AS WE GO BUT I HAD PUT THE THE GEL AFTER AHEAD PUT THE WAFERS AND IT WAS STUCK TO THE SIDE OF THE THE BOTTLE AND WHEN CHECKED ON IT IN THE MICROWAVE AND I LOOKED OVER IN MY BOTTLE IS TOTALLY TOTALLY DISTORTING ITSELF AND SO THAT SPOT THAT THAT I KEEP SHOWING YOU GUYS ON THIS PARTICULAR BOTTLE THAT WAS WHERE MY FOOD COLORING WAS ATTACHED TO THE SIDE OF IT AND IT WAS THE TEXTURE WHATEVER WHATEVER THE FOOD COLORING GEL IS MADE OF IT WAS BURNING MY BOTTOM I BOTTLES WITHERING AWAY IN MY MICROWAVE AND I WAS LUCKY TO CATCH IT IN TIME SO THAT I DIDN'T COMPLETELY DESTROY MY BOTTLE BUT ALRIGHT SO THANKS FOR LISTENING TO MY SAD STORIES HERE WE GO
THE WOLVERINE JIG ARE THESE TWO SECTIONS THAT ARE MOUNTED RIGHT BENEATH THE TWO GRINDING WHEELS AND ON ONE SIDE WE HAVE A FLAT TOOL REST IT SLIDES IT OUT AND UNDER THIS ONE OF THE ARM SLIDES IN THEM OUT
AGAIN PLACING THE FINGERS WIDE HANDS TO THE FLOOR AND YOUR LEFT KNEE ON THE UPPER TRICEP BACK SIDE OF THE ARM OF THE RIGHT ARM
BRING YOUR HEEL UNDERNEATH THE HIP CROSS THE LEFT LEG OVER SO WE'RE READY FOR THE OTHER SIDE
WE'RE GOING TO DO THE SECOND SIDE OF THAT VARIATION ON TWISTING CROW POSE
AND THAT IS YOUR SIDE KICK INNER THIGH AND LEFT
YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THEY START TO THE SIDE OF THE PATCH COVERS BEVEL AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S PUT BACK DOWN SO THAT THE BEVEL IS POINTING DOWN ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOAT OR OUTSIDE OF THE CABBAGE
AND TO DO THAT I'VE ISOLATED EACH FACE AND PUT THEM ON DIFFERENT LAYERS SO THAT WHEN THE TOP LAYER IS THE FRONT VIEW AND THE BOTTOM LAYER IS THE SIDE VIEW
IF THE BASKETBALL IS GOING OFF THE LEFT SIDE YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACK THE LEFT SIDE
IF THE BALL GOES OFF THE RIGHT SIDE YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACK THE RIGHT SIDE
SO WE'RE HERE ON FOUR WE STEP SIDE GO STRAIGHT UP OVER YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER SIX IS FROM THERE WE'RE GOING TO STEP WITH OUR RIGHT FOOT RIGHT CROSS IN FRONT RIGHT
SO I START MY REGULAR SIX FOR POSITION I DRAW MY LEFT FOOT IN AND I STEP TO THE SIDE ONE TWO
HE'LL GUIDE YOU THROUGH ALL THE PEOPLE THAT THE CONTRACT RUNNING TO MAKE SURE THAT HE'S PROTECTING YOUR SIDE
SO IF YOU LEARNED SEPARATELY HOW TO PUT THIS TOGETHER WHEN YOU DO GET INTO A GOOD FRONT SIDE NOSE BLUNT SLIDE YOU'LL BE BETTER PREPARED WHEN IT COMES TIME TO POP OUT AND ROLL AWAY
BUT IT'S REALLY THE THE EMOTIONAL OR THE SPIRITUAL SIDE
WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE YOUR BUTTON PAD AND GO AND MOTIONS THIS DOWN THE BOARD OR FOR FOR IF YOU'RE DOING THE COMPLETE FAN PATTERN ACROSS THE SNOWBOARDING ON THE OTHER SIDE AND GO THE OPPOSITE WAY SO REPELS WATER OFF TO THE SIDE UP FOR YOU
WHEN YOU THAT DOES YOU SHOW IF THE WEIGHT THROWING YOUR RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR BODY TO YOUR LEFT STEP LEFT SIDE OF THE BODY AND YOU SHOULD BRING YOUR ARM UP
SO FROM HERE I SLIDE UP SIDE KICK REVERSE PUNCH REAR LEG ROUND KICK
SO I SLIDE UP BASE MY BODY KEEP MY BODY LEVEL HERE KEEP MY HANDS UP FOR THE RIGHT LEG LEAD SIDE KICK STEP FORWARD SHIFT REVERSE PUNCH TURN THE FOOT OUT
LIFT THE LEG OUT THROW THE SIDE KICK
AND LAY ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR PULL YOUR RIGHT LEG COMES UP
WE'RE DOING INTO THE SIDE AND BRING THEM ON UP
SO YOU WANT YOUR WEIGHT TO BE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO SIDE TO SIDE
INHALE UP THE RIGHT ARM EXHALE SIDE STRETCHING TO THE LEFT
HE'S ON THE RIGHT SIDE
YOUR RIGHT HAND SIDE WE HAVE THE LEVER THAT CONTROLS THE DOSING CHAMBER AND THEN SWITCH TO TURN IT ON
AND YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO PULL YOUR BODY OF YOUR BUG ALONG SIDE
WHO LOOSE FROM THE SIDE THAT IS GOOD
THE FULL SIDE AND WHAT WHAT ARE OFTEN TRIP YOU SHOULD ROLLS ASSUME THAT YOUR GUESTS YOUR CREW KNOW NOTHING ON A NICE CHAIRS MUCH INFORMATION TO THEM AS POSSIBLE BEFORE YOU GET GOING
I'M GOING TO USE THE PURPLE SIDE OUT FOR MY HEART
I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS SIDE
NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND STRETCH THE LEFT SIDE
SO THE BREATH IS GOING FRONT AND BACK SIDE TO SIDE AND TOP TO BOTTOM
WHICH IN THIS CASE EACH SIDE IS ABOUT EIGHT INCHES
SO FLIP IT RIGHT SIDE UP TO THE SMOOTH SIDE AND THEN GET AN AREA MOIST THAT'S GOING TO BE IN FAR ENOUGH TO BE A SMALL IS THIS THEM SQUARE IS HERE
NOW THIS IS THE BOTTOM SIDE OF MY BOTTOM PIECE
SO LET ME SHOW YOU ON THE SIDE LIKE THIS AND THEN WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING IS POINTED OUT FORTY FIVE DEGREES AND THEN CLOSING ON A FULL CIRCLE BUT THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO ON THE FRONT KICK IS JUST BRING YOUR YOUR HEEL STRAIGHT UP TO YOU ABOUT LIKE THAT
AND THEN YOU NEED TO MEASURE OUT YOUR BUTTER NOW BUTTER IF YOU DON'T KNOW HAS TABLESPOONS MARKED ON THE SIDE SO WE'RE GOING TO USE TWO TABLESPOONS OF BUTTER
MAYBE WITH A FEW CURLS DOWN ON THE SIDE
AND DON'T FORGET THAT SWITCHING SIDE IT'S GOING TO COMBAT EVEN MORE DYNAMIC TO THE TRICK
YOU END UP WITH THIS GREAT KIND OF ONE SIDE STACK COMING DOWN WHICH STILL MAINTAINS WITHIN THE SHOWER PATTERN BECAUSE YOUR CAMPING AND THROWING FROM ONE HAND
SO ALL ENGAGE MY HAMSTRING AND GLUED TO CREATE THE ACTION INSTEAD OF ENGAGING THAT THE FOOT MUSCLES IN THE TOES AND I'LL DO THE SAME THING ON THE OTHER SIDE SOFTENING SPREAD THE TOES CREATE LENGTH THROUGH THE ANKLE AND THEN ENGAGE FROM THE GLUTE AND THE HAMSTRING
SO I'M GOING TO THE OTHER SIDE AT
SIDE STRETCH WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND GO ACROSS
SO YOU JUST WANT TO TURN YOUR BAG BACK RIGHT SIDE OUT
SO A SIDE FOR YOURSELF TAKE THAT RIGHT
ONCE AGAIN GETTING INTO THE SIDE BALANCE
BALANCING ON ONE SIDE
AND COME INTO THE SIDE BALANCING BOWL
THE OTHER SIDE HERE
IF IT'S GOT A COLOR ON THE SIDE THEN IT'S CHORDS POINTS
AND SO WE'RE GOING TO PRESS IT SO THE SEAM IS SORT OF TO ONE SIDE
SO A REALLY GOOD STRETCH IS TO REACH YOUR HANDS UP WAY OVER YOUR HEAD AND TO JUST LEAN TO ONE SIDE
AND WE ARE GOING TO PUT THAT ON THE SIDE AND I WANT TO BE VISIBLE SO YOU CAN SEE THE DIAMONDS
SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO COME ON THIS SIDE IT'S AND WE'RE GOING TO PART IT IN THE MIDDLE
AGAIN THIS TECHNIQUE YOU PERFORM ON EITHER SIDE IF IT SAYS SO RIGHT FOOT ONE TO TWO THREE AND TOWARDS FACE ONE ONE TWO THREE JUST LIKE THAT
WHICH THIS SIDE WE EVEN WITH THIS SIDE WITH THE THIRD AND THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE RIGHT THERE
SO ON THIS SIDE WE HAVE A TREBLE KEYBOARD WILL PLAY THIS LATER ON THIS SIDE WE HAVE THE BASS PART OF THE ACCORDION TO PLACE THE CUP NAME IT IN ONE OF THESE TWO PARTS OF THE CHORD IN OUR SUPPLY BY ERROR BY BELLOWS
AND THE TWO MAIN STATIONS IN FROG AND BOTH BRADLEY STATION SIDE TO BE REEDS WITH THE HALF OF THIS RED LINE
SO YOU WANT TO PIN THIS SIDE
YOUR LEFT FOOT IS GOING TO BE IN THE STIR UP AND YOUR RIGHT LEG IS GOING TO COME OVER ONTO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HORSE
SO YOU WANT THEIR EYE LINE TO GO A LITTLE BIT TO THE SIDE SO YOU WANT TO SIT A LITTLE BIT TO THE SIDE OF THEM SO THEY CAN LOOK OFF
AND I'M GOING TO SIT JUST TO THE SIDE OF THE CAMERA SO THEY'RE NOT LOOKING DIRECTLY AT THE CAMERA BECAUSE THAT KIND OF THE LEAVES ARE REALLY AWKWARD FEEL TO THE PEOPLE VIEWING THE VIDEO WHEN THE PERSON GETTING INTERVIEWS LOOKING DIRECTLY AT THEM
AND ONCE IT'S SETTLES YOU CAN TAP THE SIDE OF THE BUCKET JUST GENTLY AND THAT CAN URGE IT TO ITS FINAL POSITION
SO YOU START IN THAT MOUNTAIN POSE HANDS THAT YOUR HEART CENTER DOWN AT YOUR SIDE WHICHEVER YOU PREFER ON AN INHALE YOU'RE GOING TO SCOOP IT UP ON AN EXHALE YOU'RE GOING TO FALL IN FLOORING
THAT'S FOR YOU TO THE SIDE NOT FOR THEM
THE HANDS CIRCLE DOWNWARD RELAXING AND THEY BOTH HIT TO THE SIDE OF YOUR THIGH OUT TO THE SIDE OF THE BODY ALL THE WAY UP
IF YOU NOTICE SIDE IN THE WINTERTIME DRIVE ALONG AND TRY AND USE YOUR WIPER BLADES THEY WILL TOUCH ALL OVER THE WINDSHIELD ITSELF
IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT THIS CHEMICAL IN THE WORMWOOD MAY CAUSE THE NERVE DAMAGE ANOTHER SIDE EFFECTS
WELL THE OTHER SIDE IN
BEFORE YOU GO INTO A PARK KNOW THAT THERE'S A ROAD ON THE E SIDE OF THE PARK AND KNOW THAT THERE'S A RIVER WITH THE MARINE ON IT
ON THE NOR SIDE APART
IF I SHOW YOU THIS FROM THE SIDE YOU CAN SEE I'M STRAIGHT OUT AND NOT TO THE FRONT
UP AND WE'RE BACK TACK AND MAKE SURE THAT THE SEAMS MATCH UP AT THE SIDE SEAMS AGAIN
ON THE OUTSIDE OPPOSITE SIDE AS WELL THE WITH THE THAN THE ANY PART OF THE STICK RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE BALL IS GOING TO BE INSIDE AGAINST THE MILK CARTON SO YOU REALLY WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING THE STICK DIRTY WHILE YOU'RE PAINTING IT
BECAUSE OF THE PICTURE YOU'LL NOTICE THIS IS THE MIRROR IMAGE BUT YOU DON'T WANT SO WHAT YOU KNOW HIS ON THIS SIDE OF A SPACE IS NOW OVER HERE NOT A BIG DEAL
YOU FOLLOW THE MERIDIAN LINES SO THAT YOU'LL NEED IN A DOWNWARD PROCESS AS WELL AS IN CERTAIN AREAS IF I'M WORKING THE WAIST AND THE ABDOMEN ALL WORK IN A SIDE TO SIDE MOTION AS WELL AS WHEN WORKING DEEP IN THE INTESTINES YOU'LL GO AHEAD AND YOU USE YOUR FIST WITH A KNUCKLE IN A NICE TWIST
THIS NEXT FUNCTIONAL CORE EXERCISE IS A SIDE PLANK ON YOUR FOREARM
KEEPING MY FINGER ON THE INSIDE SO I DON'T DAMAGE THE SHAPE OF THE MUG COVER IT OVER THE PLACE THE BOTTOM SIDE OF THE HANDLE AGAINST THE BOTTOM PART IN THE MUD AND PRESS IT DOWN LIKE SO
I'M GOING TO TAKE MY SLAP SIMPLY PAINT IT ON ALL THE SPOTS YOU PICK THE TOP SIDE OF MY HANDLE AND PRESS IT AGAINST THE MUG LIKE SO
NOW I'M GOING TO REPEAT THE SLIP THE SCORING PROCESS THAT AND I'M GOING TO REPEAT THIS GOING PROCESS ON THE BACK SIDE OF MY HANDLE MAKING SURE IT'S NICE AND SCORED
SIDE AND JUST TO GET THEM WORK
AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO A FRONT SIDE NOSE SLIDE
SAME THING WITH THE OTHER SIDE HERE
THIS REALLY PULL THIS PART RIGHT HERE UP AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IF YOU'RE TRYING TO BREAK THE BACKBONE RIGHT BACK HERE SO LET'S MARK EACH SIDE WE WANT THE SNAP THAT I CAN GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY
SO IT'S JUST MOVED THE ZIPPER PART OVER A LITTLE SO I'M NOT I DON'T HAVE THE THE ZIPPER THICKNESS AND THE SIDE SEAM THICKNESS TO SO OVER ALL AT ONCE
AND YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU LEAVE OPEN AND JUST ENOUGH OF OF OF AN OPENING SO THAT YOU CAN TURN YOUR PLACEMAT RIGHT SIDE OUT
AND THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FABRIC IS OBVIOUSLY THE FRONT
AND THE WRONG SIDE IS THE BACK
IN THIS SAME GOES FOR THE FOREHAND SIDE SO INSTEAD OF THIS ON YOUR IT'S LIKE THAT
NOW TO WORK ON THIS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET THIS CATCH DOWN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE USED TO KICKING YOUR LEG UP AND CATCHING THE UNDERSIDE OF THE CRYSTAL STICK ON OR SO AT THE TOP SIDE THE CRYSTAL STICK ON THE UNDERSIDE OF YOUR LEG AT THE RIGHT BALANCE POINT THAT JUST SPINS OVER NICE AND EASY LIKE THAT
AFTER I PERFORM I SIXTY REPETITIONS I'M GOING TO DROP THE WEIGHT IN WITH THE POWER BLOCKS OR JUST THE WEIGHT FIVE POUNDS DOWN ON EITHER SIDE
YOU WANT IT TO BE BLENDED AND WE SEE YOUR OTHER SIDE SO JUST LIGHTLY SWEEP IT UNDERNEATH THE CHEEKBONE BACK AND FORTH AND MAKE SURE YOU GET ALL THE WAY INTO THE EAR SO YOU DON'T HAVE A LINE AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE FORGET THAT THEIR EARS ARE FOR THE FACE AND IF YOUR EAR IS A COLOR A DIFFERENT COLOR IN YOUR FACE IS GOING TO LOOK A LITTLE FUNNY
FROM HERE I'M GOING TO BRING THE FOOT DOWN STEP OUT BOW THE RIGHT HAND PERFORMS SCRAPING BLOCK AND IN THE BODY SNAPS INTO SIDE PUNCH
BUT ONE THING YOU WANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS WHEN YOU USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT HAS A SLOW BACK YOU HAVE TO COME AROUND THE SIDE AND AGE ALL OF THIS
OTHERWISE THE WHOLE STYLE WILL BE COMPLETELY THROWN OFF IF YOUR BRAID IS LEANING TOWARDS ONE SIDE OF THE OTHER
THIS IS THE BIGGEST SIDE YOU'LL PROBABLY EVER HAVE TO FEED ASSEMBLY
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE RACING THIS BIG AND SOMETHING CALLED WILD CAUGHT CHINO WHICH LITERALLY BEAMS IN SPANISH GOOD TO ENGLISH TRANSMISSION THE CHINESE BOX WHICH DEVELOPED IN YOUR BUT TO BEGIN WITH IN SOMEONE FROM MIAMI THIS SIDE OF THE CHORD A FRACTION
FOR THOSE OF YOU MORE FAMILIAR WITH PENCIL WEIGHTS THEY GO FROM NINE H AT ONE SIDE SO NINE INCHES OVER HERE TO NINE EIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF NINE BEAT ON THE OTHER SIDE
ALRIGHT YOU WILL DO IS TURN SO YOU GOT YOUR THUMB TO THE SIDE MID LINE OF THE BODY JUST LIKE IF YOU'RE HOLDING ONTO A GOLF CLUB
THE FURTHER AWAY I TAKE MY FOOT FROM THE BAND THE LESS RESISTANCE WILL HAVE WORKING TEN TO FIFTEEN REPS THREE SETS ON EACH SIDE
DO THIS WITH IT YOU CAN DO THIS WITH A KEYS OF SO THE KEYS OR EVEN JUST PUTTING SOME SCREWS IN THE SIDE THAT IS A MOLD THAT MY UNCLE TOOK VIDEOS AGO WHEN TRYING TO THINGS LOOK AND SEE
NORMALLY YOU'RE SITTING DOWN YOU HAVE IT ALMOST GENTLY AGAINST THE SIDE MAYBE SLIGHTLY
IT'S SO SOMEBODY GRABS YOU FROM THE SIDE LIKE THIS
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE SHOWING YOU PROPER SELF DEFENSE AGAINST THE SIDE BEAR HUG
FOR PULL TO THE SIDE FROM GOING TO GRAB A HOLD OF RUDY'S LEAD ROPE HERE THAT I DON'T REALLY TIGHT
REMEMBER WE WE HAVE THE ATHLETIC CROUCH BEFORE AND COMING FROM THE SIDE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENCE EXCEPT THAT WE STAND UP WE BRING OUR HIPS PELVIS UNDERNEATH THIS
THIS IS A CLIPBOARD FOR FOR GETTING EMAILS PEOPLE SIDE OF MY EMAILS AND THEN IN HERE I'VE GOT ALL THESE LITTLE FORMS AND POSTERS THAT I NEED TO SEW
IF I CLIP THAT TO THIS SIDE AND TO THE MIDDLE THEN THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WOULD BE THAT I WOULD TURN IT THE OTHER WAY THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO GET THE DESIRED EFFECT
SO YOU JUST CLIP IT TO ONE POINT ON THE SIDE AND ONE ON THE MIDDLE AND ONCE FIRE IT UP
I CAN PUT THEM SIDE BY SIDE TO GIVE YOU A CLUE IS TO WHICH ONE IS MORE CLEAR
THEN THERE THIS SORT OF AN INTERMEDIATE LEVEL WHICH SOME OF THE WOMAN WHO IS MY LAT MANAGER AND RUNS WHILE I WAS IS A VERY CAPABLE PERSON IS A PROFESSIONAL SIDE DISH
YES AND FROM THAT I WANT TO STRETCH FORWARD BRING IT DOWN UP AND I'M GOING TO GO TO THE SIDE
THAT BOSSA SPECIFIC AND STRAIN OF YOU LEAD SIDE AND YOU ALL TILE NEW CUFF
DRILL DOWN AND YOU THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY ADD SOME SOME LEAD WEIGHTS INTO THE DICE TO BE MORE THE MORE LIKELY TO LOOK TO LAND ON THAT SIDE
START WORKING YOUR WAY INWARD AND YOU'LL HEAR SOME BONES CRACK THOSE RIBS AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE
IS THAT ARM IS MOVING BACK YOU AGREE TO THAT SIDE
AS THIS WHICHEVER ARMY MAYBE THAT'S THREE AS IT'S MOVING BACK CLEAN YOU WANT TO BREATHE TO ONE SIDE
AND THEN GO TO THE OTHER SIDE AND STRETCH OUT LIKE THAT
I'M GOING TO GO SIDE TO SIDE A LITTLE HALF CIRCLES I'LL DO CIRCLES WITH ONE LEG AND THEN THE OTHER
SO WE JUST TOOK BOB TO HIS TARGET HEART RATE AND WHAT WE SIDE THAT HE DID SOME EXERCISE NOW WE WANT TO DEMONSTRATE SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED AND HIS BLOOD PRESSURE NOW THAT WE'VE DONE THAT YOU CAN
SO WHEN I GET A CHANCE I'LL USE OF A JUST DO ONE SIDE AND THEN I'LL COME BACK AFTER THIS SIDE HARDENS NOT DO THIS THE OTHER SIDE LATER
IF YOU WERE TO PUT A COAT ON THIS SIDE OF THE SAME TIME THEN YOU'RE BEING ARE POINTING YOUR KNIFE WOULD PRESS INTO THERE ON THE EDGE AND IT WOULD MAKE A GROOVE ALONG THE SIDE AND SOMETIMES MESSES UP YOUR CORNER A LITTLE BIT
AND IF I DO ONE SIDE HAND AND I LET IT SET I CAN KNOCK OFF THE BOTTOM SO MANY OTHER SIDE AND I DON'T GET THAT GROOVE THAT YOU WILL GET IF YOU WERE LIGHT PUT A COAT ON THIS SIDE RIGHT NOW
THIS IS THE PRETTY SIDE LEFT GNASHING LOOKS BEAUTIFUL
YOU WANT TO START WITH YOUR FEET SHOULDER WIDTH HIP WIDTH APART WHAT YOUR ELBOWS IN TO THE SIDE WITH A NICE NEUTRAL WRIST CHOOSING A WEIGHT THAT IS KIND OF FATIGUE THAT MUSCLE IN TEN TO FIFTEEN REPS THREE SETS
AND YOU WANT TO JUST THROW IT UP TO START BY WORKING UNILATERAL SO YOU CAN GET A FEEL FOR THE EXERCISING MUSCLE ON EACH SIDE BEFORE YOU GO ADDING IN THE DYNAMICS OF DOING BOTH WAYS BILATERALLY HERE
ONE ONE VERSION IS WHAT WE CALL SEDATION AND SEDATION IS KIND OF A GENERIC TERM FOR DESCRIBING A WAY TO BASICALLY CALM THE PATIENT DOWN IT CAN BE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS GIVING THEM SOME LAUGHING GAS ALSO NOTICE NIGER SOCK SIDE WHICH CAN KIND OF HELP RELIEVE THE NERVES OF THE PATIENT
AND ADD SOME OF THE SIDE OF POWDER
ON THE FLIP SIDE WHEN YOU THROW A BASEBALL TO ONE OF YOUR TEAMMATES YOU WANT IT TO BE A STRAIGHT AND TRUE AS POSSIBLE YOU DON'T WANT THE BOSS DIPPING INTO ALREADY AND TO DO THAT YOU WANT TO GET THE PROPER FOR SEAM GRIP
SO IF YOUR CONSERVATIVE PLAYER AND YOU WANT TO AIR ON THE SIDE OF BEING SAFE YOU COULD BID FOUR ON THIS AND PRETTY MUCH TAKE THAT TO THE BANK
TO DO THIS WE'RE GOING TO BE FILLING THE RACKING CANE OUT OF THE SINK WITH WATER AND THEN USING THIS TO START SIDE
NOW THE LAST EXERCISE TO STRENGTHEN THE CORE THAT I'LL DEMONSTRATE IS A COMBINATION EXERCISE ALSO AND IT'S A CRUNCH WITH THE SIDE BAND
NOW THE CRUNCHES CRUNCHES ARE GREAT FOR REALLY STRENGTHENING THE CORE AND SIDE BINS ARE GREAT FOR FLEXIBILITY AND STRENGTHENING THE CORE AS WELL THE OBLIQUES IN PARTICULAR
SO I'LL DEMONSTRATE NOW THE SUCK THE CRUNCH SIDE BID COMBO
LIE BACK IN THE CRUNCH POSITION I'M GOING TO COME UP AND THEN COME DOWN BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO COME ALL THE WAY DOWN BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO COME DOWN AND DO A SIDE BID CRUNCH UP SIDE BEND OTHER SIDE UP SIDE BENT THE BREATH AND YOU CONTINUE DOING THAT UNTIL YOU REACH REPS OF THE BELT ALSO A TWELVE
AND SO ONE RED IS THE CRUNCHED SIDE BID RIGHT CRUNCH SIDE BEEN LEFT THAT'S ONE RED
THE REASON WHY THEY'RE OUT IS IF YOU DO IT ON AN EVEN COUNT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUOUSLY BREATHE IN THE SAME SIDE
NEVER EVER EVER BREATHE ON THE SAME SIDE
ONE SIDE LIKE EVEN SMALLER THAN THAT SOMETIMES FOR WHAT I'M DOING
I'M AN <UNK> THIS THIS WAY BACK UP THE SIDE IS HOUSING
TAKE A PIECE OF FRENCH BREAD AND ONE TURN ON THE SIDE I'M GOING TO CUT IT IN HALF
IF SOMEONE GRABS SAY THE OPPOSITE SIDE I CAN STEP IN KEEPING THIS HAND LOW WHICH IS HOW WE DEMONSTRATE BY KEEPING IT LOW TO YOUR CENTER
YOU WANT THESE TO BE ABOUT AN INCH THICK SO THEY'RE NICE AND STURDY FOR THE SIDE BALLS OF YOUR LEAN TO SHELTER
SO I'LL LEAVE A MARGIN OF AN INCH ON EITHER SIDE
IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE DOSING CHAMBER I HAVE A LEVER TO PULL THE COFFEE OUT OF THE DOSING CHAMBER
AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE UP OVER HERE AS WELL I HAVE A STRETCH TO TURN ON THE ESPRESSO GRINDER
YOU WANT TO POSITION YOUR SONG HORSES SO THAT THE MATERIAL YOU ARE CUTTING HANGS OFF A LITTLE BIT ON EACH SIDE
YOU WANT THE CUTS AND OF YOUR MATERIAL TO DROP OFF OF ONE SIDE SO WHEN YOU RUN THE SAW DOWN HERE IT WILL FALL OFF THE SIDE ON TO THE GROUND
BENDING THAT KNEE DROPPING IT OVER TO THE SIDE OVER TO THE RIGHT AND OPEN UP THAT HIP HER EFFECT
WHEN YOU KEEP YOUR HAND UP AND YOU HAVE MORE SURFACE AREA ON THE BALL WHICH CAN HELP YOU TO GUIDE THE BALL TO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE COURT
WELL IF A PLEASE WATCH OUR NEXT SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO COVER REMOVING THE DOOR IN FOR FOR DRIVER SIDE BOTH FRONT AND REAR
OKAY AFTER YOU REMOVE THAT LEFT THAT WE JUST WANT TO APPLY THE SAME PROCEDURE TO REMOVE THE OTHER TWO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE AND WILL HAVE YOUR STATE FIFTH AND REMOVE THE OTHER WAY
SO YOUR CUT A LITTLE BIT OFF OF THIS SIDE AND A LITTLE BIT OFF OF THIS SIDE
FOLD OUT THE OTHER SIDE LIKE SO AND CREASE THAT WELL
I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS SIDE AND FOLD IT OVER LIKE SO AND TAKE THIS AND FOLD IT OVER LIKE SO
ON THE OTHER SIDE WE'RE GOING TO PUT THAT HOLLOW TUBE WE'RE GOING TO ROTATE THIS CLOCKWISE THIS TIME
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SIDE WITH THAT CONVEX GLASS IS ON THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR DOOR
SOMETIMES YOU CAN PICTURE OF THE NOSE BLUNT SLIDE AS BEING A NOSE SLIDE LIKE THIS BUT ON ANOTHER PLAYING A VERTICAL PLAYING AND SLIDING YOUR NOSE SLIDE WHERE THE NOSE ONE SIDE AS IT'S CALLED WHEN YOU DO IT THAT WAY AND POPPING IT OUT
FRONT SIDE NOSE SLIDE IS WHEN YOU OLLIE OVER A LEDGE ROLLING UP TO IT IN THE FRONT SIDE POSITION AND LAND ONLY ON YOUR NOSE AND YOUR TWO FRONT WHEELS SLIDE ACROSS THE TOP AND THEN POP OUT STRAIGHT AND ROLL AWAY
THE FRONT SIDE NOSE BLUNT SLIDE
ANOTHER KICK DRILL THAT I DEVELOPED AT THE SAME TIME THAT I DEVELOPED THE CORNER POCKET KICK DRILL WAS THE SIDE POCKET KICK DRILL
MOST ASTRONOMER SET OUT AT NIGHT ALONE THEY SAY YOU INCREDIBLE THINGS AND THEY LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO PULL SOMEBODY TO THE SIDE AND AND GET THEM TO LOOK IN THE EYEPIECE AND SAY THE BEAUTY THAT THEY SAY
NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SECOND PROCESS OF SLACK IN YOUR TANK OUT WHICH IS CALLED A KNOT TROT SIDE
YOU WANT TO POP OUT BACK SIDE OF IT
AND THAT ALLOWS THE SEATBELT TO MOVE ON THE ON THE MALE AND FEMALE LEFT SIDE
THE LOWER THE LOFT MORE SIDE SPIN YOU GET
TO BEGIN WITH THE STABILITY ON THE BOSU WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN AND YOU'RE GOING TO BRING THE BLACK SIDE TO THE TOP AND THE BALL PART IS GOING TO BE ON THE BOTTOM AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO PUT MY FEET ON HERE TAKES A LITTLE BIT OKAY YOU'RE GOING TO MIGHT BE A LITTLE NERVOUS BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO BRING BOTH YOUR FEET ON TOP OF THE BALL LOOKS JUST LIKE THAT
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A CLEAN CAPE OR A TOWEL AND HAVE SOME CLIPPERS OR SCISSORS BY YOUR SIDE
ONE IS A ON THE SIDE OF THE WEATHER OF BECAUSE IN BAD WEATHER OBVIOUSLY RING IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH AND I NEED YOU KNOW SOME TYPE OF OVERHANGING PROTECTION
ALRIGHT NOW SHE'S TURN TO THE SIDE BACK LEG IS EXTEND IT
NOW HIS JOB HAS TO BE IN HELP SIDE
SO WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR GARDEN YOUR MAN YOU GO ON HELP SIDE AGAIN YOU NEED TO STAY LOW DROP STEP AND KEEP THOSE GOOD WIDE STANCE IS UP OR SPRINT TO A PARTICULAR POINT TO TRY TO GET OVER AND STOP THIS GUY
MY SIDE THIS MIDDLE
THIS IS THE CAMERA STRAP IT ATTACHES SECURELY ON EITHER SIDE AND UNDERNEATH IS YOU SLAB THIS TO THE RIGHT OPEN THIS UP AND HERE'S WHERE YOUR RECHARGEABLE BATTERY DOOR IT TO PROPRIETARY BATTERY LITHIUM ION RECHARGEABLE YOU CAN'T USE AA THIS BATTERY AND HERE'S WHAT YOU PUT THE MEMORY CARD USES S THE MEMORY CARD
WE'RE JUST GOING TO PLACE THAT SIDE ZIPPER ON THE SIDE SEAM
SO TYPICALLY YOU MAY SEE SOMEONE LINE ON THEIR SIDE DOING INSIDE LEG RAISES OR MACHINE TO TRAIN THAT MUSCLE
I HAVE MY SIDE CUTS ALSO REFERRED TO AS DIKES FOR ADJUSTMENT OF THE REAR BRAKES
OKAY IF INDIVIDUALS AND I'M A SIDE IS IN A WHEELCHAIR WILL MASSAGE THEIR ARMS MASSAGE THE LEGS MASSAGE THEIR NECK WHILE THEY'RE IN THAT CHAIR
BUT I'M CHOOSING TO USE THE FLAT SIDE IS THE BOTTOM BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO BE THE INTERIOR OF THE TURTLE
AND YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH SIDE OF THE COIL YOU WANT TO USE BUT I LIKE TO USE THE SIDE BECAUSE IT HOLDS PAINT A LITTLE BIT OF THAT
THE WAY THIS IS DESIGNED AND I'LL SHOW YOU ON MY NEW BALL JOINT HERE TO SECOND IS IT IS A CONCAVE HERE ON THIS SIDE AND A CONVEX ON THIS SIDE
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON WHEN WE GET STARTED TO BE LEANING TO ONE SIDE
AND THEN WE WANT TO FIND THE SIT BONES SO THAT YOU CAN EQUALIZE THE SIT BONES SO THAT WE'RE NOT LEANING TO ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER
SHIFTING WEIGHT SIDE TO SIDE RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT
AND I ACTUALLY SESSION LITTLE FROM OUTSIDE TO THE SIDE
I DO IS I TAKE A SPIN IT AROUND YOUR ARMS ACROSS THAT I LAY IT UP AGAINST MY BODY TO THE SIDE AND THAT'S ACTUALLY STRIKE AND OF ITSELF BUT THEN YOU CAN TURN THAT INTO A SPIN BY TAKING IT ON FOR CROSSING YOUR ARMS CHANGING YOUR HANDS POSITIONS GUYS NOW YOUR RIGHT HAND IS PALM DOWN LEFT HAND PALM UP
CROSS AROUND LATE UP AGAINST YOUR BODY AND WHAT YOU DO THESE SCOOP DOWN CHANGE YOUR HANDS NOW YOU SCOOP DOWN TO THE OTHER SIDE AND IT'S ACTUALLY CONTINUOUS SPINNING OF THE BOW STUFF
AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO ABOUT MOCK TO THE FRONT LINE ON YOUR SIDE
SO YOU KIND OF LEAVE YOUR FINGER TO THE SIDE WITH YOUR FINGERS HERE BECAUSE IF YOUR FINGERS EVER ON THE TRIGGER YOU ALWAYS HAVE THAT POSSIBILITY THAT THE SAFETY MIGHT NOT BE ON OR EVEN IF IT IS ON IT MIGHT NOT BE WORKING RIGHT YOU CAN SHOOT SOMEBODY
AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PROCEED TO GO AROUND LIKE THIS HALF THE HEAD FROM THE EAR TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEAD THIS WAY
SO YOU JUST KIND OF HAVE TO THINK IN TERMS OF THE LAYERS GOING BACKWARDS VERSUS WHEN YOU PAINT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
ONE RULE TO REMEMBER WHEN YOU'LL EVER CLIPPING INTO YOUR RESCUE JACKET IS THAT YOU ALWAYS USE A LOCKING CARIBBEAN A ANOTHER KNEE IS IT LOCKING BUT WHEN YOU CLIP IT ON IT'S LOCKED AND YOU CHECK IT'S LOCKED AND THAT WAY IF IT SWINGS OFF TO THE SIDE IT'S NOT GOING TO GET I'M CLIPS AND CLIP IT INTO SOMETHING THAT WAS RELEASE ON THE SIDE OF YOUR JACKET
NOW WE'LL DO THE SAME ON THE SIDE SEAM
THEN RIGHT HERE ON YOUR LEFT HAND SIDE IT SAYS SCREEN RESOLUTION
OKAY SO NOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS TAKE EACH SIDE AND TUCK IT UNDER USING YOUR YOUR THUMB AND YOUR INDEX FINGER SO THAT'S TUCKED UNDER AND THIS EDGE IS TUCKED UNDER
KIND OF UNIT TO THE OTHER SIDE AND FOLD DOWN THOSE TRIANGLES
SO OPEN IT TO THIS SIDE AND THEN BALANCE OUT THE UNIT BY DOING THE SAME THING ON THE OTHER SIDE SO YOU HAVE FOUR SECTIONS ON EACH SIDE
WE DID ON THIS SIDE TURN THE UNIT OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE AND FOLD DOWN THE TRIANGLE
SO YOU'RE HOLDING HERE YOU PUSH OUT OFF TO ONE SIDE AND YOU'RE GOING TO DROP IN THIS WAY
I CAN TAKE ANY GOING TO PUSH OUT TO THE SIDE LIKE THIS AND THEN DROP YOUR HAND TO THE INSIDE SO YOU HAVE THIS TWIST MOTION
AND ALL THE SIDE AND ONE OF THOSE GREAT LIKE SHARKS THAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT CAME AROUND THE SIDE OF THE SHIPWRECK AND WITH SPOTTED THE LITTLE BABY FISH AND IT WAS VERY HUNGRY
I HAVE THIS SIDE CURTAIN I'M AND ALTHOUGH I DID AND ALTHOUGH I DID THE PACK MY SHOWER CURTAIN EARLY THIS SERVES A UTILITARIAN PURPOSE OF OF WHITE NIGHT BEING ABLE TO CLOSE IT SO I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO LEAVE THIS UP
OKAY TAKE A BIG SIDE BECAUSE NOW COMES THE BIG TEST
AND YOU CAN BE VERY VIOLIN AND GET REALLY SIDEWAYS IN THE CAR WILL STILL YOU'VE FAIRLY RECOVER WILL MAKE A SO YOU CAN GET REALLY SIDE WE'RE USING THESE CARS AND STILL BE ABLE TO CATCH THE DRIFT AS LONG AS YOU STAND ON THE DUST
ON THIS SQUEEZING IT AND THEN FINDING THE BOTTOM SO ESTABLISH THE BOTTOM SIDE WALLS AND NOW WE'RE READY TO RIP IT UP BRINGING IN
SO NOW MY HANDS GOING TO BE BY MY SIDE AND AS I I TAKE AN INHALE THIS AND I EXHALE I'M GOING TO LIFT
AND THEN WE HAVE THE DRAW STRING WHICH IS ONE LONG PIECE BUT WHEN I'M READY TO INSERT IT INTO THE BAG THAT CUT IT IN HALF AND I RUN ONE PIECE AROUND THIS SIDE TO THE WHOLE THEN THIS ONE GOES AROUND THE OTHER SIDE SO THE IDEA IS GOING TO OPEN THAT THIS IS THE WAY IT CLOSES IT PULLS THE BESIDE AGAINST THE OTHER AND CLOSE IT
ANOTHER GREAT ACUPUNCTURE POINTS IS THE SIDE OF THE TEMPLES JUST BEHIND THE BONE HAIR AROUND THE ORBIT OF THE EYE
THE WAY THAT YOU TELL WHAT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FABRIC IS IS THE OLDER COLOR YOU CAN SEE HERE AT THAT THIS IS THE BACK YOU CAN SEE THE COLORS ARE NOT AS VIBRANT AND THIS IS THE FRONT
IT'S A LITTLE MORE OBVIOUS ON SOME FABRICS THAN OTHERS SO YOU CAN ENSURE THOUGH THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHICH IS THE RIGHT SIDE
SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS PUT THE RIGHT SIDE UP LIKE THAT AND THEN GO AHEAD AND MATCH IF YOU HAVE A PATTERN LIKE THIS THAT THAT HAS STRIPES OR ANY SORT OF PATTERN LIKE THIS BE SURE THAT YOU GO AHEAD AND MATCH THEM SO THAT THEY LOOK SO THAT THEY LOOK CORRECT WHEN YOU SEW IT TOGETHER AND BOTH SIDES OF THE PILLOW
JUST GET ON TOP OF THE BOARD IN THE FRONT SIDE FIFTY FIFTY POSITION
GOOD INHALE ALL THE WAY BACK UP AND EXHALE OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE AGAIN PRESSING YOUR HIP RIGHT DOWN AS YOU OPEN YOUR CHEST OPEN THE SIDE DOOR OR THE HEART THE SIDE RIB CAGE LENGTHENING LONG GOOD INHALE REACHING BACK UP AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT AGAIN JUST REACHING OVER TO THE SIDE FEELING THAT NICE LONG SIDE STRETCH AND ONE MORE TIME OVER INTO THE OF THE OTHER DIRECTION GOOD INHALE REACH THE ARMS UP AND THEN AS YOU EXHALE DRAW THE ENERGY IN TO HEART CENTER
SO IF YOU PUNCH THAT SIDE I CAN BLOCKS TO LIKE A BLOCK WITH THE RIGHT CHOP WITH THE LEFT
THIS TECHNIQUE CAN BE PERFORMED ON EITHER SIDE WITH EITHER HAND
DON'T PICK THE ELBOW UP YOU WANT TO KEEP IT DOWN SO THAT WHEN YOU STRIKE YOU CAN MOVE UPWARD AIMING FOR THE NEXT SIDE OF THE JAW
SAME SIDE YOU PUSH LEFT HAND
ONE HAS THE THE GROOVES IN MANY OTHER SIDE IS FLAT
IF A A ONE OF THE CHECKS YOU WANT TO DO WITH THIS IS LAY YOUR TOOL AGAINST THIS AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE BODY WHICH REALLY OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS
FIND A REGULAR I'M GOING THIS WAY I START OPENING UP AND FACING MY NOSE I'M INTO A FRONT SIDE ALL OR FRONTSIDE <UNK>
YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE WILL STRING THEIR NECK BECAUSE YOU'RE SWIMMING IN YOUR REED ON ONE SIDE SWIM BREATHE IN THE SAME SIDE SWIM WITH THE SAME SIZE
WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT THAT IS IS THAT IT'S A FAKE JUST A FAKE TO ONE SIDE SO THEY THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GO THAT WAY BUT THE BALL IS GOING TO KEEP DRAWING THE SAME WAY AND YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT
TILE NOW TO SAVE THIS STYLE WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS PRESS THE MENU BUTTON ON THE TOP LEFT SIDE OF THE CAMERA AND THAT USER DEFINED NUMBER ONE SETTING YOU CAN SEE HAS BEEN BASED OFF THE PORTRAIT PICTURE STYLE BUT HAS BEEN CUSTOMIZED AND SAVE
ONE WILL GO INTO THIS SIDE UP THE OTHER ONE WE'LL GO DOWN THE BACK COVER
NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IN ORDER TO MAKE IT EASIER TO TOP INSIDE AT THE EDGE WHERE THE CONTINUATION OF THE BOOK WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A LITTLE SNIP THE TABLE HAVE IT'S GROOVES OVER HERE AND THEN ALSO ON THE OTHER SIDE
YOU CAN HIT SOME DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN HIT IT ON THE SIDE OF THE SOUND I CAN MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A HARD MOVIE
JUST KIND OF WORK YOUR THUMBS AROUND THE SIDE OF HER HEAD TO PULL A LITTLE BIT OF HAIR DOWN
LET'S JUST SAY YOU HAVE A NICE COLOR HEARTS SUIT FOR EXAMPLE AND SOME SIDE ACES
AGAIN A LATERAL SIDE FLEXION TARGET THE OBLIQUES
AS THIS IS A LOCKS THAT VICE GRIPS STYLE WRENCH THAT ACTUALLY LOCKS ON THE NUT THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON SO YOU CAN USE THE OTHER HAND TO LOOSEN AND TIGHTEN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOAT

NOW WE'LL START AT THE SIDE SEAMS
GO UP AND DOWN LIKE THIS AND EVEN GO SIDE TO SIDE OKAY
NOW THE QUARTERBACK PIN IS GOING TO TURN AND RUN TO THIS SIDE OF THE FIELD AND HE'S GOING TO TRY TO LOOK TO HELP OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLAY
OUR QUARTERBACK PRETTY MUCH RUNS JUST LIKE YOU WOULD A NORMAL HAND OFF PLAY EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT ONCE THE HANDS THE BALL OFF OUR QUARTERBACK THEN ALSO HAS TO TURN AND RUN TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FIELD SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN GO DOWN FIELD AND BECOME A BLOCKER AS WELL
AND FAR SIDE MASS COSTS YOU FIVE COLORLESS TO PUT OUT
AND NOW I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FAR SIDE MAT
IF YOU NOTICE IS VERY LIGHT I'M DOING THE CRUNCH FROM THE SIDE
BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING WHERE I JUST SHOW UP AND I'M TALKING TO YOU FOR A WHILE HOW TO THE SIDE
AS A ON THE BACK OF THIS PICTURE YOU'LL SEE THIS ON HEAVIER PICTURES ARE HEAVIER MIRRORS YOU ACTUALLY SEE THE THIS WIRE THAT IS STRONG FROM EACH SIDE
AS YOU TURN SIDE TO SIDE YOU KIND OF THE FACE THAT LEG A LITTLE BIT
SO JUST SIDE TO SIDE
ALSO THE SAME TIME REMEMBERING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN ARCHITECTURAL PHOTOGRAPHY TO KEEP YOUR LINES STRAIGHTS WITH THE SIDE OF THE PICTURE OF BECAUSE THAT IS THE WAY THAT THE ARCHITECT INTENDED TO SEE
TAKE A KNEELING POSITION AND AGAIN PULL THE BALL INTO MY HIP AND PLACE THE HIP ON TOP OF THE BALL TO LEAN OVER AND I'VE JUST PLACE MY HAND AT THE SIDE AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS REDUCE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN MY RIB CAGE AND MY HIP
KEEP THE STRIP ON THIS SIDE
NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE THE CORK OF THE KNEE THE BACK OF THE KNEE COME AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE CHAIR BACK LEG STARTS EXTEND
IT'S GOING TO INDICATE IT'S THE RIGHT OR PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE
SO WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU A FULL SPEED HERE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE WHEN HE COMES OVER ON HELP SIDE TO STOP THE DRIVE
SO JUST REMEMBER WHICH EVER ARM YOU START TO BEGIN YOUR PULL THAT IS THE SIDE THAT YOU WANT TO BREATHE OUT
LATER ASKED TAPE OVER TOP OF THE PIECE ATTACKING TAPE IT RIGHT DOWN THE SIDE OVER HERE TO MAKE SURE IT'S NICE AND SMOOTH
NOW THE SPIKES OR LITTLE TINES THAT ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE CACTUS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF AND HAMMERED INTO THE NORM OUT OF HERE SO THAT THEY STICK INTO THE EMPTY CAVITY INSIDE THE RAIN STICK
LEAD SIDE KICK MEANS THAT I'M GOING TO BE USING MY FORWARD LIKE TO THROW THE KICK
THE MOVING BEGINS WITH LEAD SIDE KICK
THE DREMEL COMBINATION THAT WE'RE DOING IS LEAD SIDE KICK REVERSE PUNCH REAR LEG ROUND KICK
ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO POKE HIM IN THE CHIN BUT THE LAST SECOND YOU GO RIGHT UP THE SIDE OF THIS RIGHT SIDE OF HIS JAW RIGHT HERE
GET YOUR SHOULDERS AND THEN IN THE POSITION THAT YOU WANT TO LAND IN AND FRONT SIDE WITH A AND ROLL AWAY FAKIE
JUST BEFORE YOU GET TO THE END THAT SUGGEST ABOUT SIX INCHES TO A FOOT BEFORE THE AND YOU GET YOUR SHOULDERS ADJUSTED AND THEN FRONT SIDE <UNK> OUT AND LAND FAKIE AND ROLL AWAY
ONCE IT'S ABOUT ONE BUBBLE EVERY SIX SECONDS YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GO FOR YOUR FIRST RACKING OPERATION WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN LATER SIDE
AND THEN THE KIND OF THE HALLMARK OF THE BELLY DANCER IS HAVING A NICE DARK LINER AND THEN SOMETIMES WILL PULL IT OUT AND HAVE A NICE LONG LINE OUT THE SIDE OF THE EYE
YOU DO NOT WANT TO TAKE THIS CAKE TOO MUCH BECAUSE YOU CAN TOTALLY DAMAGE OR WHAT WE WANT TO PRESS AND THROW THE KICK IS ONE ONE TO THE SIDE BECAUSE THE KICK
INSTALL THE DISCHARGE TOES IN THE PORT ON THE SIDE OF THE FILL TUBE PRESSING
WE HAVE A A PIN ARE CLIP THAT WE PUT ON THE SIDE OF THE TANK OR I'M SORRY ON THE SIDE OF THE FILL TUBE OR THE OVERFLOW TUBE

TINY UNIT TO THIS SIDE THE FRONT SIDE

PLAY WHEN IT'S ANOTHER POWERFUL RESET CARD BUT IT'S A ONE SIDE OF THE SIX CARD WHICH MAKES IT ALL THAT MORE POWERFUL
SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET STARTED ON THE LINING AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE FLIP THE JACKET OUT INTO THE WRONG SIDE IS SHOWING IN THIS IS THE LINING AND WE'RE GOING TO MEASURE FROM THE SEAM WHERE IT WAS ATTACHED TO THE JACKET THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH UP AND FOR DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT THE PRESS SCENE CAUSE THAT'S NOT THE SEAM THAT WERE WORRIED ABOUT
I'M GOING TO MENTION THAT COLORING IT KIND OF THE MORE PROFESSIONAL KIND OF BECAUSE YOU CAN AND MAKES THE DIFFERENT LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT COLORS YOU CAN MAKE IT THE LIGHTER ON ONE SIDE DARKER ON THE OTHER SIDE KEY WHICH GIVES IT THE SHADY KIND OF LOOK
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE SIX BALL IN THE SIDE POCKET
AND A NICE WAY TO CUT THIS IS TO COME DOWN THE BONE LIKE THIS ALL THE WAY DOWN AND OFF TO THE SIDE
IF I'M COMING UP HERE WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE BALL OUTSIDE THE CORD ON THE SIDE TO GO
NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE BLACK IN ON THE SAME KIND OF A LITTLE TROUBLE THAT HAPPENS ON THE FLOOR WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET A LITTLE MORE BEAD ON THE BACK AND SIDE SO YOU CAN SEE IT
AGAIN NORMALLY HAPPENS ON THE BACKHAND SIDE BECAUSE WE ARE MOVING ABOVE THIS ALL OUT WHEN WE'RE AIMING THE BALL AS YOU CAN SEE MY FACE OF THE RACKET IS LOOKING OVER THEIR INSTEAD OF LOOKING IN FRONT OF ME AND IS HAPPENING BECAUSE MY WRIST IS GIVING NAP MY LEFT RISK OF THE NAPE OF MY BODY IS GOING FORWARD
IF YOUR BODY'S GOING TOO MUCH TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CORE THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE HITTING IT PROBABLY TOO MUCH IN FRONT OF YOU
IN THE FACE TOWARDS THE RIGHT SIDE
NOT ONLY IS IT SIDE IT BUT ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF OUR TREATED CAN TEXTURE IS WHITE SO WE THOUGHT HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE EYE ONCE WE ONLY STRENGTH IN OUR STORYTELLING
IT'S REALLY MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN YOU'RE USING IT ON THE SIDE OF THE COURT
AND THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A GOOD AS STRATEGY IS TO SHOOT TWENTY FIFTY A HUNDRED TO ONE AND SHOTS FROM THIS SIDE I USE IN THE BACK COURT UNTIL YOU GET LOST IT
WE DON'T WANT IT TO HAVE ANY EXCESS FORWARD ROLL WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY EXCESS BACK SPINNER SIDE SPIN OR ANYTHING ELSE
AND WHEN YOU WANT TO YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO TURN YOUR SHOULDERS LIKE A BACKSIDE BOARDS ARE BACKSIDE ONE EIGHTY TO FRONT SIDE NOSE
LOOKING AT OUR HANDS OUT IN THE DIAGONAL AND THEN YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU COME BACK AND YOU'RE REALLY RELEASING THE OBLIQUES THE SIDE THE HIPS ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH THE FINGERTIPS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
THIS ONE HAPPENS TO BE LOCATED ON THE RIGHT SIDE RIGHT DOWN HERE
NONE OF THESE NOBODY LIVES IN THIS LITTLE TOWN ANYMORE AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY JUST GO THROUGH THIS BATHROOM OR YOU'RE GOING TO GET UP TO THE OTHER SIDE HERE
OKAY TAKE YOUR ARMS TO THE SIDE
THIS ONE'S MY PFD DESIGNED FOR SOME IN MY SIDE IT'S A STYLE THAT YOU PUT ON OVER IT OVER YOUR HEAD SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THE OTHERS
ANOTHER WAY TO GET YOU FROM SIDE TO SIDE THE STEP TOGETHER WITH BASICALLY GET YOU IN CIRCLES OR FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER SIDE
IT'S ACTUALLY JUST STEPPING TO THE SIDE AND BRING YOUR FEET TOGETHER
IT'S A V STEP OUT STEP TOGETHER STEP OUT STEP TOGETHER YOU CAN DO THIS FROM WALKING FROM SIDE TO SIDE OR IN A LARGE CIRCLE
BUT YOU'LL FILL ON THIS SIDE AND YOU ALSO FILL IN THIS SIDE ENTIRELY WITH SKY IN THE SKY BLUE MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
WITH THE WEIGHTS ARE FREE WEIGHTS HANGING RIGHT NOW BY YOUR SIDE OR AN OPTION WOULD BE TO PLANT THEM ON THE MEATY PART OF THE SHOULDER RESTING LIGHTLY ON TOP
AND WE WANT TO COME OUT BEHIND THIS ONE AS WELL SO BE CAREFUL REPLACE THE PORTAL SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU CAN APPROACH DIFFERENT FROM THE SIDE OR THE BACK
ON THIS SESSION WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE WE'VE GOT A SONG TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE REAL REAL ON THIS TWO TRACK REEL TO REEL AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FLIP THINGS OVER SO THAT WE CAN HEAR IT
THE SIDE SEAM AGAIN
AND THEN DO THE SAME THING ON THIS SIDE
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE GINA COME ONTO THE GROUND YEAH SHE'S GOING TO BRING YOUR KNEES FORWARD AND SHE'S GOING TO COME INTO A MODIFIED CHILD'S POSE TAKING HER FINGERS IN SO HER ELBOWS CAN BE OUT TO THE SIDE
WHEN I GET LOST THE SIZE ARE GOING TO BE READING THROUGH WE'RE GOING TO STICK TO ALIGN KEY YOU ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'VE ON THAT SIDE GO SO ANOTHER KEY THAT YOUR RAT TAIL
BUT I RESERVED THIS POLISH IT UP TO THE SIDE FOR WHEN WE GO TO THE SHOWS
ALRIGHT NOW LET'S LEARN HOW TO DO BOUGHT MOSS ON LYING ON THE SIDE
THIS WILL CONNECT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF YOUR TUBE
BEING A STAMP BRIAN MY STAMP THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LINE
YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO GO ON EITHER SIDE OF IT AND YOU AS YOU RUN YOUR FINGERS UP AND DOWN ON EITHER SIDE YOU'LL FEEL THEM SORT OF SINK INTO THIS VALLEY
GENERALLY LOWER LIDS UNLESS YOU'RE WORKING ON ONE SIDE IS WEARING A LOT OF EYELINER ARE GOING TO BE A LOT LESS PROMINENT THAN THE UPPER EYELET
GOING BACK AND FORTH JUST GIVEN A NICE CUTTING THAT'S A NICE IT ONTO YOUR THING AND JUST AGAIN PUT IT RIGHT HERE ON THIS SIDE KIDS CAN GRAB IT THEY WANT
FROM HERE SHE'S IN ALL OUT BOTH HANDS TO COME UP TO THE FRONT SIDE HERE AND THEN SHE'S GOING TO LOWER ITSELF SLOWLY THIS WAY
OKAY THE HARMS OR JUST LOOSE BY THE SIDE TO BEGIN WITH
AGAIN IF YOU CHOOSE TO TRY TO DO THESE ON AND MAKE SOME OUT FRONT KICK SIDE KICK I'M SORT OF BACKSWING RIGHT HERE YOU CAN DO THAT YOU LIKE TO MIX IT UP LIKE THAT
YOU ALSO GOT JUMPING SIDE KICK WHICH IS EASY TO RUN IN ACTUALLY LEAP INTO SOMETHING
I LIKE TO USE IT ON THIS SIDE AND AS YOU CAN SEE
AND THEN THE EASIEST WAY I FIND TO CUT THESE IS I LIKE TO USE THIS SIDE UP
AND THIS WILL HELP YOU LEARN HOW TO GET OUT OF A FRONT SIDE NOSE SLIDE SLIDE
IN THIS SIDE IS THE ONE OF THE HOLE
THAT'S ONE SIDE I'M GOING TO GO AND DO THE OTHER SIDE
TO SET THE CAMERA TO PORCHER MODE WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS TAKE THIS MODE DIAL HERE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BACKSIDE OF THE CAMERA AND I'M JUST GOING TO SPIN IT FROM A FULLY AUTOMATIC MODE TO PORTRAIT MODE
HI I'M BOBBY LAREW AND WE'RE HERE PULL SIDE I'M GETTING READY TO DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU ANY REVERSE ONE HALF SUMMER SOFTEN THE TUCK POSITION OR GAINER ONE IN HALF MOON DIRECTLY TO THE BALL THE SAME THING
THE CREASE TO THE CENTER AND THEN TURN IT AND REPEAT OVER TO THE SIDE
SEE I HAVE A NICE RIBBON OF FROSTING COMING UP ON THE SIDE PLENTY OF FROSTING
YOU CAN EXTEND ONE ARM HERE I'M DOING MY RIGHT ARM AND THE RIBS ARE GOING TO EXPAND AND LIFT TO THE RIGHT SIDE AS IF I HAVE AN APPLE NEUTRINO REACHING TO PICK IT
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WINGS ONE FOR EACH SIDE OF THE BODY
OF SIDE WON'T SQUARE AND
NOW THIS SLIP PUNCH YOU PRACTICE THIS ON EITHER SIDE
USUALLY BRING SOMEONE WITH YOU FOR THE APPOINTMENT JUST TO BE IN A SAFE SIDE
SO I'M STARTING WITH THREE WEIGHT'S ON THIS SIDE AND THREE REDS ON THIS SIDE AND WHEN I'M DONE WHEN THEY'RE ON THE FLOOR THERE SHOULD BE A PILE OF THREE WHITES OVER HERE AND A PILE OF TWO REDS OVER HERE
SO I'M GOING TO START ON THE LEFT SIDE OF HER LEGS
NOW WORK MY WAY THROUGH THAT AREA UNTIL IT'S CLEAR AND THEN DO PART ON EACH SIDE OF THE LEG IN ON A CLEAR SECTION HERE AND I WOULD BE GOING TO A SECTION HERE
OBLIQUES DOING SIDE TO SIDE MAYBE WITH THE WEIGHT OKAY OTHER CRUNCH IS THAT WE CAN DO FOR OUR STOMACH IF I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT UPPER BODY
TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE THAT HAVE A WIRE BRUSH THAT STICKS AND THEN YOU ROTATE TO CLEAN THE FEMALE SIDE
YOU WANT TO COME STRAIGHT UP TO THE SIDE
I'M GOING TO SHOW THAT FROM THE SIDE AGAIN
THE EYE OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO THE SAME THING TO THE SIDE THAT WE DID BEFORE
THUMBS ARE FACING IN ROTATING MY HAND AND I'M COMING STRAIGHT UP TO THE SIDE OKAY
THE LAST TIME REACHING THE KNEE TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE
IN OUR NEXT SEGMENT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PUT THIS STRING ON THESE PINS AND HOW TO REMOVE THEM FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND GIVE YOU SOME OPTIONS ON DIFFERENT WAYS THAT CAN BE DONE
THE FOOT POSITIONS ONE STEP LEFT FOOT BACK RIGHT FOOTED THEY IS LEFT FOOT TO THE SIDE CLOSE RIGHT FOOT LEFT FOOT LEFT FOOT TO THE SIDE DRIED SOMETHING THAT IS LEFT FOOT GOES THE RIGHT FOOT RIGHT FOOT TO THE SIDE WE'LL END
YOU CAN AVOID THAT BY LISTENING TO GUIDE AND PADDLING IF YOU HIT THE ROCK ANYWAY THE GUIDE SHOTS OUT HIGH SIDE IF YOU CLIMB TOWARD THE HIGH SOLDER THE ROCK THE HIGH SORT OF THE ROCK AND WHAT WILL COME OFF THE LOW SIDE YOU CAN SPEND ALL ABOUT ROCK SO TO WRITE A CLOSE COOLING CONTINUE ON DOWN STRAIGHT
ALSO MENTION HIGH SIDE IT WON'T HAPPEN TODAY HIGH SIDES WE'RE ROTH HITS A ROCK NOT A SLIDE UP ON THE ROCK AND FLIPS OVERALL STICKS THERE
IF YOU FIND THAT WHEN YOU'RE DOING A HIP ROLL THAT YOU'RE TAKING SOME TENSION IN YOUR NECK JUST GENTLY ROCK YOUR HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE
WE WANT TO PUT A HOME SIDE ON HERE SO WE NEED IS SOME WAY TO GET HEAVY CORRECTION EQUIPMENT ONTO THE LAND ON THIS VERY RED CLAY GUMBO SOIL THAT IT'S THE VERY EASY TO GET STUCK IN
AND I'M GOING TO BRING MY PADDLE TO THE SIDE I'M GOING TO TUCK FORWARD AND WHEN I'M TUCKED FORWARD MY HEAD IS PROTECTED WITH MY HELMET MY PFD PROJECTS MY BACK
YOU CAN ALWAYS PLAY TENNIS ON THE SIDE OF THE WALL OR BACKWARDS SO THE TENNIS COURT IS DEFINITELY OPTIONAL WHEN IT WHEN IT'S COMING TO PLAYING TENNIS
YOU KNOW YOU CAN ADD IT ON THE SIDE
WHEN YOU'RE SWIMMING AGGRESSIVELY IN COLOR AND A LOT OF TIME TO RESCUE SITUATION YOU NEED TO ACCESS MIDSTREAM BALL SIDE OF THE OR THE EIGHTIES
AFTER CUTTING THE VINYL OFF YOU CAN FLIP THE PANEL OVER AND CUT OUT THE CLOTH IN THE BACK SIDE
IF YOU WERE JUST IF I WAS MAKING CHARACTERS A SIDE DISH I GO FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT PROBABLY THERE'S AS SOMETHING CALLED AN DANCE ANY AND TVS CARROT THAT'S A LITTLE FRENCH CARROT THAT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL
BUT ACTUAL BABY CARROTS WITH THE TOPS ON THEM TO MAKE A REALLY NICE SIDE DISH YOU SAUTE THEM WITH A LITTLE OLIVE OIL BUTTER AND HONEY
YOU CAN SEE IT'S OR TO THE SIDE OF IT TRAILS DOWN
SEAMLESSLY SO THAT'S GOING TO BE SHOWING YOU TODAY SOME OF THOSE FEATURES IN A FEW OF THE NEW FEATURES AND SIDE FLASH ITSELF
SO IF MY TEAM SERVES A BALL BUT AT THE OTHER TEAM GETS THE BALL AND IT PUTS IT INTO OUR SIDE OF THE COURT AND THEY GET THE POINT EVEN THOUGH THAT INSERT THE BALL AND VICE VERSA
THAT WAS STRETCH SIDE TO SIDE
ONE MORE AND HELPS TO WASTE AND STRETCH AND EXHALE LIFT COME BACK TO CENTER TAKE A DEEP INHALE FLIP THE FINGERTIPS AS YOU EXHALE DOWN BY YOUR SIDE
AND EXHALE LIFT BACK THREE CENTER TWIST TOWARDS YOUR LEFT SIDE AND REACH UP AND OVER
IT BACK UP TO YOU AND GET THAT FLAT BACK THAT ENABLES YOU DID AGAIN REACH UP AND OVER RIGHT SIDE
I'M JUST GOING TO TUCK THEM IN ALONG THE SIDE AND YOU'LL GET BEURY DIDN'T
IF YOU ARE GOING TO FURTHER UP THE SIDE OF THEIR CUP
WE'RE THROWING IT UP AND IT WAS HITTING THE ONE SIDE OF THE BOX
SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE A OR A WAVE EFFECT AND IT'S VERY CONFUSING BECAUSE THE CHOSEN THE BASES AND THIS SIDE MIGHT GET ONE OF THEM YOU KNOW ONE THING AND THEY THINK MY ELBOWS YOU KNOW THE FOLLOWING MY ELBOW ALMOST BECAUSE FROM THE YOU KNOW FROM THAT ANGLE IT LOOKS CONFUSING TO THE ORCHESTRA
FOR US WILL ROLL TO THE WATER BOX AND COME JUST TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE ON THE OTHER SIDE WHERE TIRES ARE STILL A BIT WHETHER WE'RE UPON DRY PAVEMENT
I'M GOING TO USE THIS SIDE AS WELL
WHATEVER YOU DO TO ONE SIDE YOU NEED DUE TO THE OTHER
FRONT THE FRONT BACK BACK FRONT AND HIT THE CORNERS TO INSIDE CORNER OF SIDE CORNER SIDE CORNER SIDE
AND FRONT SIDE PULL THAT BELLY IN AND POPPING OUT THE CORNER AND SKY THINGS CORNER AND SIDE AND CORNER AND SIDE CORNER AND SIDE
ONE ARM IN FRONT WANT ON TO THE SIDE
SO HE IS NOW GOING TO BE DEMONSTRATING SORT OF A SWING TO THE SIDE
SO THAT DOUBLES ARMS AND YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD TORQUE BAM AND DECIDE BAM AT THE SIDE DOWN TO THE SIDE
TAKE THE SIDE WITH OUT THE BUCKLE AROUND YOUR FEET AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE THE SAI WITHOUT THE BUCKLE CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT THE BUCKLE ON YOUR SKIN IT CAN BECOME UNCOMFORTABLE
NOW WE'RE GOING TO THE BACK SIDE FACING IN YOU CAN HEAR THAT THE VILLAGE REALLY HOT AND START WINE THAT FELL DOWN I'LL KNOW THAT IT KIND OF TURN IT TO THAT I'VE GOT IT ALL FLY KNIFE
OKAY SO I'M GOING TO DO AND I CAN FACE YOU ACTUALLY I JUST WANT TO START WITH YOUR FEET APART YOU SWING TO ROLL IT DOWN BECAUSE YOU CARRY A LOT OF TENSION IN YOUR BACK IN YOUR NECK AND USE THE STRETCH IT OUT AND YOUR WAX SIDE TO SIDE AND YOUR LEFT FOOT AND YOUR RIGHT HIP KEEPING YOUR KNEES STRAIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL A NICE STRETCH ALRIGHT
NOW THIS TOOL THE SCRAPER WORKS VERY WELL ON FLAT GRAIN DOWN IN THIS AREA WHERE THE GRAIN IS ALL THE SAME BUT IF I COME OVER INTO THE SIDE GRAIN HERE OVER HERE THAT I'VE GOT A VERY LONG GRAIN IN HERE I'VE GOT IN GREEN SHORT GRAIN
IN THIS VEHICLE THERE'S ACTUALLY A BRACE STRUCTURAL BRACE THAT COMES OUT ON EACH SIDE FROM THE FRAME AND THE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO PLACE OR DECKS TEN RIGHT UNDER THE
BUT ALSO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTRAST ON ONE SIDE OF THE OF THE SUBJECT
THE REASON THAT THEY WOULD BE FIFTEEN INCHES IS BECAUSE WE NEED TO EXTEND THE NEXT TWO INCHES ON EITHER SIDE TO CONNECT WITH THE CROSSWISE BINDING
YOU SHOULD FEEL NICE OPENING THROUGH YOUR SO AS HERE AND IF YOU'RE FEELING LOTS AND LOTS OF PRESSURE ON YOUR FRONT SIDE IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE LEANING TOO FAR FORWARD
YOUR SPEAKER OVER HERE ON THE OTHER SIDE
HERE'S BECAUSE ON ONE SIDE
YOU WANT TO BE A LITTLE BIT ON THE DRY SIDE
IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THE LENS OFF AGAIN WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO IS PRESS THAT ARE THAT LENS LOCK RELEASE OVER HERE ON THE ON THE SIDE OF THE CAMERA
SO NOW WE GO AHEAD AND WORK ON THE FRONT SIDE LEGS
IT OR AND SWITCH INTO THE OTHER SIDE
AND THE SAME THING WITH THE OTHER SIDE
SO I'M LIFTING TO THE SIDE
THE STABILITY BALL EXERCISE IS GOING TO TARGET THE OBLIQUES WHICH RUN ON THE SIDE OF THE WAYS
TO ADVANCED EXERCISE I COME UP ON TO BOTH LEGS SO I'VE ADDED A BALANCE CHALLENGE PLACE THE HAND BY THE EAR AND AGAIN THE MOVEMENT IS INITIATED FROM THE OBLIQUE MUSCLES ON THE SIDE LIFTING UP
GOING THE OTHER SIDE
NOW THIS LAMP IS GOING TO GO ON ONE SIDE OF YOUR AQUARIUM JUST LIKE YOU SEE THERE
SO YOU GOT A SEVEN ON SEVEN YOU SHOOT EVERYBODY AND YOU GOT TO GRAB THEIR FLAG PUT ON THIS SIDE AND THEN THERE'S RECREATIONAL PAINT BALL WHICH IS JUST LIKE FAMILIES COMING OUT HERE SHOOTING EACH OTHER OF THE PLAY CAPTURE THE FLAG STUFF THAT BUT IT'S MOAN IT'S MAINLY IN THE NATION
YOU WOULD HAVE TO SHOOT EVERYBODY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TEAM
SO IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S OVER TO ONE SIDE A LITTLE MORE JUST KIND OF START PULLING IT WHILE YOU'RE SEWING INTO STRETCH AND A LITTLE BIT
WE GO AND WE PUT ON THIS SIDE AND WE'RE READY TO SLICE UP
PERHAPS TO ONE SIDE AS WELL BUT IT'S ALL ALMOST ALWAYS GOING TO BE FROM ABOVE UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY DOING AN ODD LOWER LIGHTING EFFECT
I'M GOING TO TAKE SOME MORE CLAY FROM THE MIDDLE HERE BECAUSE I REMEMBER HOW THICK IT WAS LET'S DO IT MOVING IT SO MUCH IS THROWING REALLY OF I'M MOVING CLAY FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER ALRIGHT
AND WE'RE JUST SIMPLY GOING TO TAKE THE LINES OF ENERGY ALL THE WAY TO THE SIDE
SO IT'S A ZIP THE FAST WOMEN OR SOMETHING DRAWING ALL THE ENERGY INCLUDING THE ARTIST TO THE SIDE
THE LONGER THAT SHE MAINTAINS THE POSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEEPEN THAT TWIST AS THE MUSCLE BEGIN TO SETTLE IN AND RELAX AND THEN PRESENT THE POSE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
I REACH THE PRICE POKE MASS NOT REVOLVED SIDE ANGLE
SO TYPICALLY WE COOK KIND OF USE IT LIKE A REGULAR AN EXTRA EXCEPT WE REACH AROUND BACK AND THERE'S TWO LITTLE HOOKS ON THE SIDE
WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT ON OUR SIDE SO WE'LL TAKE A MOMENT JUST COME TO YOUR SIDE AND THEN I STAY WITH THE BOTTOM LEG
IF YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS REVERSED AND HE'S TRYING TO GIVE YOU A HAND OFF ON THE WRONG SIDE AND YOU GOT YOUR ELBOW OUT THERE CHANCES ARE YOU'RE GOING TO HIT WITH YOUR ARM AND YOU'RE GOING TO KNOCK THE BALL LOOSE FROM THE QUARTERBACK
I'M NOT GOING TO BE USING A CHAIR LIFT MOST OF THEM HAVE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS ALMOST LIKE AN ESCALATOR THING TO IT AS A MOVING SIDE WALK AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE THAT IN A LITTLE BIT OF A ROPE TOE THEY JUST STAND UP AND HOLD ON TO THE RING AND PULL YOURSELF UP
NOW WHAT HE'S GOT ON HIS HANDS NOW IS HE'S GOT POSSIBLY A RUNNER PLAY THAT'S GOING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD ARE COMING UP THE MIDDLE SO HE'S GOING TO IGNORE ME AS THE QUARTERBACK
NOW ON THE FOREHAND SIDE YOU CAN GO ALL LAUGHED BIG AND RIGHT YOU CAN COVER A HUGE MANA CHORD IF YOU TAKE YOU THAT'S USUALLY DO THAT WHEN YOU'RE UNDER SOME TYPE OF PRESSURE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE THE STRONGEST POSITION SO YOU CAN SEE IF YOU'RE HERE YOU'RE IN KIND OF A RELATIVELY WE POSITION AND YOU CAN TURN IT AROUND IS A GOOD SHOT BUT TO GETTING TO THE CORNER MORE UPRIGHT POSITION IS BETTER
I USUALLY FIND IT'S GOOD TO KIND OF PICK ASIDE AND LESS AN OBJECT SUPPOSED TO BE IN TOTAL DARKNESS SO KIND OF PICK A SIDE THAT YOU WANT THE SHADOW TO GO ON LIKE I'M DOING HERE
NOW WHEN YOU MOVE YOUR SPATULA BACK AND FORTH TO SMOOTH THAT ICING ON THE SIDE YOU YOU TO SORT OF A EDGE TO EDGE MOVE
SO INSTEAD OF STARTING HERE WHERE YOU ENDED YOU WANT TO START A LITTLE BIT FURTHER UP ON TOP OF FROSTING AND CONTINUE SPREADING IT ALONG THE SIDE FOLLOWING THE CONTOUR OF OUR THERE
WE'RE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT COVERING THE SIDE AND THEN AFTER WILL GO AROUND AND SMOOTH IT OUT
ALWAYS STARTING A LITTLE BIT BACK WE'VE ALREADY FROSTED USING A LOT OF FROSTING AND WORK YOUR WAY AROUND THE CAKE SIDE SPREADING THAT FROSTING DOWN
AND THE BALL COMES TO YOU YOU GOT A PERSON YOU TRY TO GO AROUND THEIR DEFENDER NOW YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO THE SIDE COME AROUND ON OUR EASE KIND OF YOU KNOW CUT BACK WHATEVER
THIS HAND GOES PALM UP SLIGHTLY FORWARD PRESSURE AND I'M USING MY FOREARM AGAINST THE SIDE TO HAVE HER DOWN
AND THEN I'M GOING TO PLAY AND LAY OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ADHESIVE THEY'RE GOING TO GO ONTO MY NEXT PIECE THAT I CONSIDERED AN UNDER LAYER LAY IT OUT ONTO THE PLEXIGLASS ROLL OVER ONE SIDE ROLL OVER THE OTHER AND AGAIN LAID OUT ONTO THE SURFACE OF MY COLLAGING MATERIAL
TAKE THE LEFT SIDE BRING IT TO THE MIDDLE
BUT I'LL USE THE THREE HUNDRED DEGREES FOR ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES AND ENCHILADAS SIDE COME OUT SO DELICIOUS AND THAT IS IT FOR A STICK IT IN THE OVEN
THAT IS YOUR SIDE PLANK ON THE FOREARM
YOU CAN ALWAYS HOLD THE SIDE PLANK ON THE FOREARM FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS TO A MINUTE
SO THE MOVES GO SIDE TO SIDE UP AND DOWN WITH VERY DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES
I'M GOING TO DO THE SAME THING WITH THE OTHER SIDE
AND THEN COMING TO THE OTHER SIDE TUCK YOUR TOES GRAB THE HEEL STANDING UP WIGGLE AROUND THE BED MAKE SURE SHE'S STILL LOOSE SO YOU CAN KEEP THE BACK OF IT NEAT MAKE IT BAND FOOT OVER THE SHOULDER GRAB A HOLD THAT KNEE AND WIND IT TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE
NOW IF WE DO THIS FROM LATERAL SIDE AND IF YOU'RE FEELING GOOD MORE AND THEN YOU'VE GOT YOUR BALANCE YOU CAN ADD IN THE ARMS
LET'S JUST TRY CHAIR POSE WITHOUT ARMS JUST LET THEM RELAX BY YOUR SIDE
YOU WANT IT TO BE A NICE EVEN RATING ALL AROUND THE PICTURE AND THEN WE'RE JUST GOING TO ONE BY ONE PLACE OUR BEADS ON THEIR SIDE ALL THE WAY AROUND THE PICTURE
LAY IT UP AGAINST THE SIDE AROUND THE CORNER AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT THAT'S PRETTY GOOD
FROM HERE FOR COATING ACTUALLY LIKE I TALKED BEFORE IS NOT A WRIST LOCK OUT TO THE SIDE LIKE THIS
SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THAT LIFT IS LEFT SIDE USE THAT LEFT FOOT WE'RE GOING TO BE PUSHING HIM TO THE SIDE WALL HE WALKS FORWARD
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SPECIFIC AREAS WHERE YOU CAN USE CHOPPING ON A HORSE AND AGAIN WHEN I SAY CHOPPING AND TALKING OF HOLDING YOUR HAND LIKE THIS USING THE SIDE OF YOUR HAND OKAY YOU CAN USE IT RIGHT IN BACK OF RIGHT IN THE WEATHER IS AREA NOT ALONG THE SPINE IN THE AREA THAT'S RIGHT HERE NEXT TO THE SPINE AND BACK TO THE SHOULDER BLADE
THAT MAKES IT SO THE BALL JOINT ON THE UPPER SIDE WILL BOLT IN THROUGH YOUR CONTROL ARM BUSHING HOLES
NOW WE NEED TO FIND THE WHOLE WAY POINTS FOR HOLD ONE STILL I'M TWIST THE OF THIS ALL THE OTHER SIDE
IF YOU GO UP TO THIS EVERYTHING YOU DO A MORE SIDE THE CALF
IT SHOULD BE LABELED PRETTY CLEARLY ON THE SIDE WALL
THE STITCHING THAT TO THE OTHER SIDE IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO HOLD THE STRETCHES FIFTEEN SECONDS
BECAUSE SINCE YOUR WRITING YOUR RIGHT HAND RIGHT ARM IN RIGHT SIDE IS GOING TO DO SO MUCH
YOUR LEFT SIDE YOUR WEAKER SIDE AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WEAKER IF YOUR ARE RIGHT HANDED TRY THROWING THE BALL LEFTY SEE HOW FAR IT GOES
IT'S GOING TO DO SO MUCH YOUR RIGHT SIDE
SO NOW WE FOLDED ARE QUEEN SHEET IN QUARTERS NEXT WE'RE GOING TO FALL FOLDED IN HALF AGAIN ON THE SIDE EDGE
THE FIRST THING YOU CAN DO IS YOU DO BALL TOUCHES THE STANDING ON ONE SIDE OF THE BALL
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SHRIMP AND SCALLOP FETTUCCINE WITH THIS SIDE OF GARLIC BREAD
SHE DID NOT DONE THE BODY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
A STEREO CLOSER TO THE SIDE AND IT IS GOING TO WIGGLE IT LOOSE
SO WHEN YOU'RE SEWING THIS TOP SEAMS MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT SIDE IS THE WHOLE BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT OF YOU SO THAT ONE CLOTHES
THAT IS THE DINNER SKIS ON THIS SIDE I WANT TO ENTER SEE IF I CAN GET IN AS DEEP AS THEY CAN GET THIS OVER THE TOP RAISE UP A STRETCH THE ARMS
AND IF YOU DROP IT INTO THE SIDE AND COME IN
SO WITH THIS COULD BE A STEP THIS SIDE STEP WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS STEP NOW AND ADD SOME VARIATIONS TO IT
THE NEXT CLIP IS GOING TO BE A SIDE SQUATS WITH THE BALANCE TRAINER
OUR INHALE IS GOING TO LIFT THE SPINE LIFT BOTH ARMS AND THEN EXHALE REACH OVER TO THAT SIDE
SO IF WE COME BACK UP FIELD THE SUPPORT FROM THE FEET AND THE INHALE TO EXTEND SIDE LEG EITHER LEGS NOT GOING TO MATTER BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON BOTH SIDES
A MOST LIKELY TO USE MY SIDE ARM SERVE ON THIS ONE AND I JUST HIT IT AND I WAS AS GOOD AS I LIKE ALMOST PERFECT AND THERE WE GO
SO BY HITTING THE BALL UP HERE OVER MY OPPONENT IS FORCED TO TAKE THE BALL HIGH WITH HIS BACKHAND OR YOU JUST TAKE THE WRIST OF LETTING HIM COME OFF THE BACK WALL OR DYING BACK HERE SO THIS IS A VERY VERY EFFECTIVE SHOT SO ONCE YOU'VE MASTERED THE TECHNICAL SKILLS OF JUST HITTING THE BALL IN A DECENT MANNER YOU WANT TO START INCORPORATING HITTING IT TO SPOTS ON THE SIDE WALL TO MAKE YOUR SERVE THAT MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE
WE CAN LONGER YOU COME UP AND EXHALE ON THE LEFT SIDE
AGAIN I LEFT SIDE
I'D GO WITH THIS HELPS TO DO IS STRETCH OUT THE OBLIQUES THE STOMACH THE SHOULDERS THE ARMS ON ONE SIDE
AND THEN I GO BACK TO CENTER AND THEN GO TO THE OTHER SIDE
AND IF WE ACTUALLY DO IT TO THE SIDE LIKE THIS YOU'LL SEAL IT WILL ACTUALLY YOU KNOW CONFORMED HOWEVER WE PULL IT WHERE IT
WE HAVE TO DO THE SAME WITH THE OTHER SIDE
EACH SIDE OF THE DICE HAS A PARTICULARLY NUMBER ON IT TO A CORRESPONDING NUMBER
NOW I TALKED ABOUT HOW EACH ONE ON EACH SIDE HAS A PARTICULAR PART OF A TRAIN ON IT
THIS EFFECT BACK IS REALLY GOING TO TEACH YOU THE HABIT OF COMMON TO THE CORRECT IMPACT POSITION AND IF YOU NOTICE HERE MY WEIGHT IS WELL INTO MY LEFT SIDE THE CLUB FACE IS BEHIND MY HANDS SO MY HANDS HER HEAD AND IN THIS POSITION I'M ABLE TO HIT DOWN ON THE BALL
KEEP ALL THE WAY YOU CAN SEW THE FLOOR BRING YOUR BODY TO THE RIGHT SIDE BREATHE AND RELAX WEB YOU HIT
SO YOU BASICALLY JUST CUT YOUR HOLE RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF YOU ABSOLUTELY AND HAVE YOUR BUCKET OF BAIT OFF TO ONE SIDE EDGE IT RIGHT OVER THE WHOLE AND ALL THE TIME THE WIND IS THAT YOUR BACK
ONE MORE DOING THIS SIDE CHAMBERS SIDE STEP YES NOW CIRCLE BLOCK PUNCH
THIS IS THE DOT THEM PALM PUNCH CHAMBER STAY THERE CHAMBER THIS NOW OPEN THIS HAND MELISSA TURN OVER NOW HERE STEP TO THE SIDE OKAY PALM BLOCK NOW STEP TOGETHER PUNCH
MY RIGHT FOOT IN RIGHT HAND GO TOGETHER CAT STANCE PUNCH CHAMBER THE HANDS SIDE STEP DOT CAT STANCE PUNCH
IF WE'RE MOVING TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT WE SHOULD ALSO TRY TO KEEP THAT SHOULDER ABOVE THE KNEE AT ALL TIMES ON SO THAT WE'RE NOT LEANING TOO FAR OFF TO ONE SIDE
ONCE YOU START LEANING TOO FAR FORWARD TOO FAR BACK OR TOO FAR TO ONE SIDE AND MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO GETTING KNOCKED OVER WHEN YOU DO GET PUNCHED
FIRST COUPLE TIMES YOU'RE GOING TO GET UP PADDLING YOU'RE GOING TO FIND YOURSELF ACTUALLY GAINING THIS SIDE OF THE BOARD WITH THE PADDLE
RISSA IS GOING TO COME ALONG SIDE HER YEAH AND TAKE HER KNEES EQUAL TO GINA'S KNEES HER HANDS AGAIN ARE ALSO GOING TO BE RIGHT UNDERNEATH HER SHOULDERS
SO ON THIS ONE THE LIGHTS MOSTLY COMING FROM THE SIDE AND WE CAN CREATE THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK OH THE TREE FROGS ALWAYS DARK THAT'S NOT ALWAYS TRUE IS HIGHLIGHTS TO THAT TOO
HOW TO DRAW A TREE OKAY THANK OKAY THERE'S A AND THEN YOU COME DOWN FROM THERE YOU HAVE THE TREE PART OF IT COMING DOWN HERE ONE SIDE THE LIGHTS COMING FROM THIS SIDE
NOW THIS CAN TURN TO THE SIDE THAT CAN TURN OUT SLIGHTLY BUT PRIMARILY YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE ON A CENTER LINE
BUT YOU WANT TO TURN THE NUT SIDE AND LOOSEN THE NUT SIDE
SO WHEN I WIND UP FOR THE BEGINNING THE SWEEP I HAVE A LOT OF POWER PULLING THE BOAT INTO THIS SIDE AS I ON ONE MY TORSO COME BACK TO NEUTRAL AND IT IS THAT POWER
I'M FROM BIKES THAT DON'T HAVE QUICK RELEASES IT BASICALLY LOOKS LIKE THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS YOU ARE LEVER HERE IT'S JUST THE BOLT BOLGER'S ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LEFT SIDE LIKE THIS ONE THIS BECAUSE THERE'S A LEVER ON THE OTHER SIDE
YOU'RE GOING TO PLACE THE THE PLATE SIDE WE'RE HERE IT IT'S IN BLACK
THE OTHER SIDE IS SILVER
WE WANT TO KEEP ALL THOSE DETAIL FEATURES BUT WE HAVE TO LOSE THE STUFF AROUND THE SIDE
IT WILL TAKE THE REINS OVER HER HEAD AND WE'RE GOING TO COME AROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE AND RUN THE RIGHT STIR UP UP
I HAVE THE LINING PULLED OUT ON ONE SIDE AND THIS IS THAT THE FABRIC IS A LITTLE BIT AWAY FROM THE ZIPPER SO JUST MOVE IT OVER RIGHT TO THE EDGE
LASTLY YOU NEVER WANT TO CUT WHEN THERE IS A HARD SURFACE BEHIND YOUR WORK PIECE BECAUSE YOU NEED THAT ROOM FOR THE BIT WHEN IT PROTRUDES THROUGH THE BACK SIDE OF IT
IN A LOT OF THESE OF THE TEXTURE THING ON ONE SIDE AND NOT ON THE OTHER SIDE
AS YOU CAN SEE THIS SIDE COMPARED TO THE SIDE TO SIDE LOOKS A LOT FILLER
WHEN YOU CLICK ON THAT YOU SEE THAT THE GOOGLE NOW IS ONLY LOOKING AT THE INDEX OF BOOKS THAT IT HAS THAT YOU CAN SEARCH THROUGH AND YOU SEE THAT THERE'S MANY ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE AS MANY DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF BOOKS THAT YOU CAN LOOK THROUGH BUT YOU CAN YOU DO YOUR SEARCH
A LOT OF TIMES GO AHEAD AND LET THE BALL THE BALL WILL BE LAYING ON THE GROUND IT MAY EVEN BE TURN TO THE SIDE
WE'RE HERE EYES FOR A REVERSE YOCOM INTO THE SIDE OF THE HEAD
I WILL DO THE SAME THING TO THE OTHER SIDE
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF YOUR AQUARIUM GOING USE THE HEAT PAD
YOU WILL GET READY HE OUT OF THAT BOTH IT'S GOING TO CREATE A HOT SPOT FOR YOU OKAY IN YOUR SIDE YOUR AQUARIUM
OKAY NOW SOMETIMES WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE GOING TO GET AN ALGAE BUILD UP ON THE SIDE OF YOUR TANKS
THE FORWARD ACTUALLY SMALL FOR WILL HAVE THIS RESPONSIBILITY I HEAR ANYTHING BEYOND THAT POINT GUARDS REACH IS ON ON THIS SIDE OF THE COURT WILL BE THAT SMALL FORWARDS RESPONSIBILITY
ON THE OTHER SIDE SAME THING WITH THE SHOOTING GUARD ANYTHING OVER THEIR PASS THE POINT I WILL BE THAT POINT THAT SHOOTING GUARDS RESPONSIBILITY
SO YOU'LL HAVE THE POINT GUARD UP TOP YOU HAVE A FORWARD RIGHT HERE A CENTER WILL BE A LITTLE FURTHER BACK BUT YOU'LL WHAT YOU'LL HAVE IS YOU HAVE A SMALL FOR HERE YOU'LL HAVE THE SHOOTING GUARD ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SUPPORT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEFENSE
SO YOU'LL HAVE A SMALL FORWARD POWER FORWARD ALONG THE MIDDLE AND YOU'LL HAVE THE SHOOTING GUARD ON THE OTHER SIDE
NOW THIS EXERCISE IS PART OF THE SERIES THAT WE DO ALL ON OUR SIDE
THIS BEGINNER PILATES EXERCISE IS CALLED THE SIDE KICK INNER THIGH LEFT
SO THE REASON WHY WE'RE PUTTING THE STICKS IN WITH THE THE WOODEN SIDE IN FIRST IS ONE BECAUSE THE THE TIPS OF THE MATCHES GIVE A DECORATION TO THE STICK AND THE OTHER REASON IS BECAUSE THE TIP OF THE MATCH ALSO HELPS THE STICK FROM KNOCK GOING THROUGH ALL THE WAY TO THE END
GO DOWN TO THE GREEN SIDE
I'M GOING TO USE A FOUR WAY FILE LETS GET DIFFERENT GRIPS ON EACH SIDE
FROM HERE YOU'RE GOING TO REACH OUT TO THE SIDE YOU'RE GOING TO BRING YOUR HAND STRAIGHT TO YOUR SIDE AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO FORM THE EAGLE CLAW
THE ELBOWS GO OUT TO THE SIDE AND YOU EXHALE AS YOU LIFT UP INHALE AS YOU GET DOWN EXHALE AS YOU LIFT UP
SOMETIMES IT LOOKS GREAT JUST TO HAVE A KIND OF MAYBE A LITTLE MORE OF A FASHION LOOKED ALMOST HAVE A PRETTY MUCH STRAIGHT IN IT AND THEN YOU'RE KIND OF JUST KIND OF PEAKING AROUND THE SIDE GET THE SHOT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
A GREAT WAY TO LEARN HOW TO DO FRONT SIDE NOSE BLUNT SLIDES IS FIRST TO PREPARE YOURSELF FOR THE POPPING OUT PART

ONE VERY IMPORTANT DRILL THAT BEGINNERS SUMMER'S CAN USE IS SIMPLY IN THEIR OWN BAT HARNAGE CUSIANA SWIMMING POOL IN THAT SIMPLY PUTTING YOUR FACE THE WATER BLOWING AIR BUBBLES OUT NICE AND SLOW AND TURNING YOUR HEAD TO THE SIDE
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO TO FIX THAT IS YOU WANT TO SET UP IN YOUR HEEL FLIP POSITION TO HIT THE TAIL AND AND REPLACE THE WEIGHT ON THE FRONT SIDE OF IT SO THAT YOUR WEIGHT IS BALANCED EVENLY AND IT ENDS UP FLIPPING STRAIGHT AND YOU'RE ABLE TO ROLL AWAY
AND YOUR HAND SHOULD BE BY YOUR SIDE
