URSA SET DOWN UP SO IT JUST STAND STICKER A LITTLE BIT OF A DELAY THERE
THERE'S ALMOST A LITTLE BIT OF A DELAY FOR IT
HI IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO TALK ABOUT A NAIL DELAY AND WHAT A NAIL DELAY IS IS WHEN YOU'RE SPINNING THE FRISBEE ON YOUR NAIL
SO WHAT YOU ALSO WITH THE NAIL DELAY YOU NEED TO PUT A LOT OF SPIN ON YOUR FRISBEE
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I TOOK THIS DELAY PEDAL AND PUT IT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAIN I WOULD BE DISTORTING THE SOUND OF THE DELAY RATHER THAN IF I PUT IT AT THE END
THE DELAY WOULD BE DELAYING THE SOUND OF EVERYTHING THAT CAME BEFORE
AND THEY'RE NAMED REVERB ONE AND DELAY ONE
