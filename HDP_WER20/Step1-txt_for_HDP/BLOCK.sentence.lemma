SO SHE'S GOING TO INHALE AND LENGTHEN AND AS SHE EXHALES SHE'S GOING TO ROTATE TOWARDS HER KNEE GOOD AND THEN PRESS HER HAND INTO THE BLOCK
SO THIS WOULD ACTUALLY BE A PAIN LIGHTER ROPE HERE IS TO THIS BLOCK OF WOOD
FROM HERE I'M GOING TO BRING THE FOOT DOWN STEP OUT BOW THE RIGHT HAND PERFORMS SCRAPING BLOCK AND IN THE BODY SNAPS INTO SIDE PUNCH
AGAIN MY NAME IS WES RHODES I'M FROM THE CHINESE KUNG FU ACADEMY AND THAT IS THE DOUBLE PALM BLOCK COUNTER FOR SURROUND KICK
AGAIN MY NAME IS WES RHODES I'M FROM THE CHINESE KUNG FU ACADEMY AND THAT IS YOU PERFORM THE OUTSIDE PALM BLOCK REAR LEG REGRET HOOK KICK
AND THE PAPER IS HOT ON A GRETEL ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TOUCH THAT WAX BLOCK YOU SEE IN YOU CAN DIRECTLY TO PAINT WITH THE WAX
NOW ON ONE OF THESE ON THE RIGHT IT IS DRAWN ON A LOT WITH THE WAX DIRECTLY IN BLOCK FORM ON THE PAPER ITSELF
SO THAT WAS A LITTLE DEMONSTRATION AND WHAT IT MEANS TO BLOCK AND DOING OF BLOCKING OFFERS CORE DOORS
USUALLY BLOCK OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS WHEN IT REALLY SERVES THE STORY
OFTEN TIMES WE BLOCK JUST BECAUSE WE'RE FEELING NERVOUS
OF COURSE SOMETIMES IN SCENES YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO BLOCK
IF WE'RE READY TO GET SOMEWHAT BLOCK FROM CORROSION PIECE TO RUST STUFF FROM INSIDE THE ENGINE GETS BLOCK UP INSIDE HERE AGAIN IT WILL OVER HE
WHICH IS JUST USUALLY OFF OF THE BASIC BLOCK BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE EXPANSION CARDS THEY AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW WITH THESE CARDS ME BUT THESE CARDS ABILITIES ME
MAYBE A PAIR OF I SHIFT TO THE BALL AND THE OFF OF WATER THE BLOCK YOU PERFORM FIVE DIFFERENT ABOUT IN THIS IN THIS CDS
ONE IS THE STRONG BLOCK WHERE YOUR DENYING THE REALITY THAT SOMEONE IS TRYING TO SAY
BUT THIS TIME ON TOP OF THE BLOCK OF BLACKS GOING TO BE REALLY HELPFUL
GIVE YOURSELF IN OUR BLOCK IN OUR OF TIME FIRST
SO NOW THAT I HAVE DONE THAT I'M ALSO GOING TO WANT TO MARK MY PAPER THIS PARTICULARLY BECOMES IMPORTANT IF YOU'RE PRINTING SEVERAL TIMES WITH YOU THE SAME BLOCK OF WOOD OR AND SEPARATE BLOCKS OF WOOD
SO IF YOU PUNCH THAT SIDE I CAN BLOCKS TO LIKE A BLOCK WITH THE RIGHT CHOP WITH THE LEFT
THE DEMONSTRATES TECHNIQUE AS THEY PUNCH BLOCK AND STEP IN CHOPPING AIMING FOR THE NECK JUST LIKE THAT
YOU PUSH THE OTHER HAND I CAN BLOCK WITH THE RIGHT TO LEFT
YOU WANT TO BRING THIS BLOCK TO ROUND AND CUT TWO SHOULDERS ON IT
WATER FIRST THINGS TO DO IS GET A A BLOCK OF WOOD MOUNTED INTO THE LATHE
HOMME LIKE I SAID ONCE YOU GET THESE ONE EIGHTIES YOU PROGRESS IN THE THREE SIXTY IS WHICH IS TO FULL SPINS ON FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE FORTY WHICH IS ONE AND A HALF FULL SPINS SO ON AND SO FORTH AND THEN BASICALLY THIS ONE EIGHTY IS THE STEPPING BLOCK TO EVERY OTHER SPIN
I STEP STRAIGHT BLOCK HANGING TRACK
DRAW IN MY HANDS IN THE FIST DRAW MY LEFT FOOT AND BLOCK WITH MY LEFT FORM
I STEP STRAIGHT A BLOCK AND EACH ONE
WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON TIME TOYS SERIES ONE THE TRANSITION TO RIGHT BACK FIST AND FINISH TONGUE PLAY ONE I'LL DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU AT NORMAL SPEED THEN I'LL HAVE MELISSA PERFORM IT FOR YOU SLOW DOWN SO I CAN POINT OUT SOME OF THE FINER DETAILS PICKING IT UP FROM WHERE WE PERFORM ROLLING BLOCK RIGHT TOE KICK
MY LEFT HAND PERFORMS A CIRCLE OVERHEAD PALM BLOCK
AS YOU EXHALE YOU'RE GOING TO BEND THE KNEES IF IT FEELS SAFE FOR YOUR KNEES AND COME ALL THE WAY OUT ONTO THE BLOCK
NOW THAT'S A BLOCK COMES IN HANDY REST YOUR HAND RIGHT UPON THE BLOCK YOU CAN LAY A BLOCK DOWN FOR SECURITY OR YOU CAN TAKE YOUR HAND RIGHT DOWN TO THE FLOOR BUT IN ANY CASE YOUR ICE STAY ON THAT LEFT HAND
THEY'RE THE BLOCK STYLE THAT ARE MORE LIKE THE CHALK AND THIS IS THE SAME THING ONLY ANOTHER VERSION WITH ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS COLORS
BUT IF THEY'RE SPEARING STRAIGHT IN THIS ONE IS GOOD SO THE SPIRIT THIS BLOCK IT STRAIGHT UP THIS WAY AND FROM HERE YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT
THAT'S THE OVER THE HEAD BLOCK IN STAFF
WE'RE GOING TO PLACE THIS BLOCK RIGHT BEHIND FACE SPINE
THERE'S A SMALL AREA WHERE I MY RADICAL LIGHTS UP TO SHOW ME THAT I CAN PLACE A PORTAL SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO THAT AND THEN I'LL PLACE ANOTHER ONE IN THIS ROOM AND STEP OUT AND THAT PUTS ME ON TOP OF THIS BLOCK DISPENSER
THIS MEANS THAT I CAN PUT MY BLOCK OF WOOD IN EXACTLY THE SAME PLACE EVERY TIME I WANT TO PRINT
NOW THAT I HAVE FOUR CORNERS LAID OUT AND MY J I CAN REMOVE MY BLOCK OF WOOD AND FAIRLY EASY TO THE PLACE IT BACK INTO MY JIG
SO THE QUARTERBACK'S JOBS JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ON THE REVERSE WHERE HE'S GOING TO GO AHEAD AND FAKE TO PLAY CARRY OUT THE HAND OFF OF THE PLAY AND THEN HE'S GOING TO TRY TO GET IN THE ACTION OF THE PLAY AND GET A CHANCE TO THROW BLOCK
THAT'S HOW YOU PERFORM OUTSIDE BLOCK HIGH CHOP
I CAN BLOCK WITH A LEFT TOP OF THE RIGHT
THAT IS A REGULAR TAIL BLOCK I MEAN TAIL WHEELIES
THIS CARD HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE ON SLOW DOWN SLOT BLOCK
TO BLOCK YOU USE YOUR WHO IS RESTING ON MY SPACE

YOU ARE WORKING ON BEING ABLE TO BLOCK COUNTER
AND PLACING THINGS ALL ON YOUR COFFEE TABLE YOU WANT TO BE SURE SOMEBODY IS SITTING HERE IT YOU DON'T WANT TO BLOCK THEIR VISION AND SO YOU WANT TO PUT SOMETHING ON YOUR TABLE THAT'S KIND OF LOW
IF YOU HAVE THE TIME TAKE YOUR BLOCK OF BUTTER OUT LEAVE IT OUT FOR AN HOUR

IT COMES IN A LARGER BLOCK FIVE TO TEN POUNDS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ONE LIKE CUTTING IT THE BEST WAY TO CUT IT IS TO USE ANOTHER PIECE OF WIRE
SO YOU TAKE THE BALL YOU TAKE YOUR RACKET YOU OPEN THE FACE AND YOU JUST BLOCK IT AGAINST THE WALL AND THAT'S A FOREHAND VOLLEY RIGHT THERE
BUT THEN I HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL TO SAND THIS IS A SANDING BLOCK FOAM SANDING BLOCK THE ENDS OF THOSE TUBES
AND ONCE THAT ENERGY IS BLOCK THAN THIS SITZES BELIEVE TO SET IT
A LOT OF TIMES IN THE TIGHTER AREAS I'LL GET A SMALLER BLOCK
SOMETIMES THE BLOCK ALSO AND THEN IT STAND
IN THE BLOCK HERE YOU'RE GOING TO FIND WHAT THIS CARDS ARE SPECIAL ABILITIES ARE
LAY YOUR TOES LEAVE THE BLOCK
AS THE ATTACK YOU'RE GOING TO BLOCK THE LEFT AND DRIVE THE PALM TOWARDS THE NECK
I'M WAS FROM THE CHINESE KUNG FU ACADEMY AND FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND THIS IS HOW YOU PERFORM MANTIS FIGHTING TECHNIQUE OUTSIDE BLOCK CHOP
AND WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL PUT THE EDGE OF THE BLOCK ON THE FLOOR AND WE'LL USE OUR BODY WEIGHT AND LAY ON THE BLOCK IT SUPPORTING YOURSELF WITH YOUR ARMS
HE'S GOING TO TIME IT JUST SO WHEN HE IS MAKING HIS REACTION HE'S GOING TO HINDER BLOCK DO WHATEVER HE'S GOT TO DO WITHIN THE LEGAL PARAMETERS OF THE GAME TO KEEP HIM FROM COMING DOWN AND MAKING A PLAY ANY CLOSER THAN THEN THE POSSIBLY NEEDS TO
NOW WE'VE GONE OVER THE CRACK WHICH IS A GREAT BLOCK
THAT'S THE TO ALL TILE BLOCK PLANE
YOU SAY THAT FIRST THAT PARTICULAR CREATURE CAN NOW BLOCK DURING THIS TURN AND HE CAN'T BLOCK DURING THIS TURN
AND ONE AND A RED TARGET CREATURE CAN'T BLOCK THIS TURN
WE STRETCH THE KNEES UP JUST LIKE WE DID ON THE BLOCK NOW THE GLUTS NOT THERE
IF YOU STAIN IT IN THE IN THIS STATE YOU'RE GOING TO GET ALL THAT FOR YOUR AREA AND EVERYTHING IS THAT WEATHER IS OFF YOU'LL GET BLOCK UNISON YOU'RE STAYING YOU DON'T WANT THAT

THE FIRST STEP IS MY DODGING STEP SO I GO DYCHE PALM BLOCK
THIS IS HOW TO DODGING PALM BLOCK CAT STANCE PUNCH KUNG FU FOR HEALTH
SO ONE ONE THING THAT WE CAN DO TO GET RID OF THEM INSTEAD OF RUSHING THEM WITH THE BLOCK BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MANY OF THEM WE CAN PLACE A PORTAL UNDER THE DIFFERENT FOR US AND OUT LET THEM FALL THROUGH OR WE CAN PLACE ONE BEHIND AND WALK UP AND GRAB IT LIKE WE'VE BEEN DOING
IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO OVER DO DRAWING A TREE WITH ALL THOSE LITTLE LEAVES ON IT BUT THAT'S WHERE IT COMES IN IN HANDY HAVEN'T CHARCOAL OR A PIECE OF PENCIL LEAD AND BLOCK IN THOSE SHAPES
SO PLAYING CHORD VOICINGS IN THIS SEGMENT I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU DIFFERENT WAYS TO PLAY YOUR CHORDS AND JUST SO YOU CAN SOUND A LITTLE BIT MORE PROFESSIONAL WITH YOUR PLAYING AS OPPOSED TO JUST JUMPING FROM BLOCK ROOT POSITION CHORDS
THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW THE DEFENSE TO CREEP UP AND ADJUST AND THEN OUR FULLBACK IS GOING TO GO AHEAD THROUGH AND HELP BLOCK
THIS ONE IS CALLED OUR PALM BLOCK LUNGE PUNCH
WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN THIS ONE WITH OUR PALM LOCKS ARE GOING TO BRING YOUR LEFT HAND OUT PALM BLOCK
SO BY DOING SHEET ON WE LEARN TO MOVE THE BODY ALONG WITH MOVING THE ENERGY INSIDE OF IT SO THAT WE CAN ON BLOCK THOSE AREAS THAT TEND TO US OUR SLOW AND SHE OR AND END UP BEING BLOCKED BY THE FLOW OF ENERGY
