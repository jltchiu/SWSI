SO LET'S TRY NICE SPACE FOR THE SUBJECT AND YOU CAN WRITE WHATEVER YOU WANT ANY UPDATES ON FAMILY THINGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND SO I'M JUST GOING TO TYPE IN A LITTLE THING RIGHT HERE AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE DONE TYPING THE BODY OF YOUR BOWL OF TEN GO AHEAD AND COME DOWN HERE
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GRAB THE BASE OF THE BODY IN THE PANTS TOGETHER AS WELL AS THE BACK OF THE NECK OF YOUR SCARECROW AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO PUT THEM IN YOUR CHAIR AND SLIDE DOWN AND IF YOU HAVEN'T STUFF PROPERLY HE'S GOING TO STAND UP ON AS WELL AND YOU HAVE YOUR HEAD PIN DOWN SECURELY THAT'S GOING TO STAND UP AS WELL

YOU MADE THESE UNDULATION TRAVEL FROM YOUR KNEES TO YOUR HIPS FROM YOUR HIPS TO YOUR UPPER BODY UNTIL IT GOES OUT
YOU CAN GET A FULL TANNED BODY AND LESS THAN A MINUTE AND THAT WILL USUALLY LATCH YOU ANYWHERE UP TO A WEEK
SO WHAT I'M DOING NOW IS GOING TO BRING THE KNEE ACROSS MY BODY AND THRUST IT STRAIGHT INTO YOU AS A BACK LEG SIDE KICK
I'M GOING TO BRING THE KNEE RIGHT UNDER MY BODY AND ONCE IT COMES ACROSS THIS FOOT HAS TO PIVOT HARD AND FOUR
THE BEST PLACE TO START FINDING MISALIGNMENTS IN YOUR BODY IS IN YOUR STANDING POSES
SO WE WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THE BODY HAS TO SAY TO US WHILE WE'RE TALKING IN OUR STANDING POSES
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE THE STRENGTH AND BALANCE AND THEN WE'LL WORK UP THE BODY REALIGNING AGAIN IN ANATOMICAL POSITION SO THAT YOU CAN START TO REALIGNING SCALE TO STRUCTURE
IT'S THE FIRST PLACE THAT YOU'LL BEGIN TO NOTICE IN BALANCE IS FROM THE RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR BODY TO THE LEFT SIDE OF YOUR BODY THE FRONT SIDE OF YOUR BODY TO THE BACK SIDE OF YOUR BODY
IT'S YOU USE THE BODY
ONE THING THAT I'VE NOTICED ABOUT BODY BOARDS IS TO GET A BAD ONE FROM A GARAGE SALE
IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO A BODY BOARDS IS YOUR WEIGHT YOUR HEIGHT AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON THE WAY IS IF YOU'RE JUST ME FLOUTING AROUND A WHITE WATER ALL YOU REALLY NEED TO SOMETHING TO HOLD YOU UP AND KEEP YOUR FLOAT

SO YOU GET AS CLOSE TO YOU CAN SEE THE FAR WITH YOUR WEIGHT WILL KIND OF GET BACK THIS WAY AND LEAN YOUR BODY WEIGHT OUT TOWARDS THE RAMP
THE RULES ARE NUMBER ONE YOU GOT TO KEEP YOUR ELBOWS NEXT TO YOUR BODY
WE WANT TO BE BOTH OF OUR ELBOWS NEXT TO OUR BODY MEANING THEY'RE NOT OUT IN FRONT AND THEY'RE NOT BEHIND OKAY
OKAY SO WHEN BOTH OF OUR ELBOWS ARE NEXT TO OUR BODY THEY CREATE A RIGHT ANGLE HERE LIKE AN L FROM AND OUR HANDS CAN TOUCH
A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO KEEP THEIR LENSES STORED IN A CASE TO PROTECT THEM INSTEAD OF LEAVING THEM ON THEIR CAMERA BODY BECAUSE THEY'RE EXPENSIVE
AS MY BODY COMES TO POSITION THE SWORD COMES IN POSITION
OKAY NOW I'M READY TO TAKE THE CLUB BACK PROPERLY AND TO PUT A PROPER POWER FROM THE BODY INTO HITTING THE BALL
IT'S VERY FEW GREAT PLAYERS THAT HAVE BED GRIPS BECAUSE THE GRIP IS LIKE THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE CLUB IS CONNECTED TO THE BODY THAT'S HOW THE BODY IS CONNECTED TO THE CLUB
FOR EXAMPLE THE A UNIVERSAL CHICAGO OR SOME KIND OF A STEADY THAT I'M SHOWED THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE LONELY TEND TO HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL HAPPEN TO HAVE A HIGHER LEVELS OF THE FIREFLY LIGHTER FIGHT CHEMICALS THAT WOULD PRODUCE WE'RE STRESS AND IT'S KIND OF A CHRONIC THE IN OVER TIME THEY FOUND THAT THAT THAT CAN CAUSE INFORMATION THE BODY AND CONNECTING CONTRIBUTE TO A WHOLE RANGE OF UP THE STARTERS
BUT THE IDEA IS THAT I'M HAVING COMPANIONSHIP IN FRENCH AT IN A PERSON'S LIFE IS IMPORTANT FOR CONTRARY TO OVERALL HEALTH OF YOUR PHYSICAL BODY
AND YOU'LL JUST WANT TO BREATHE INTO THE BLOCK AND TAKE YOUR TIME TO RELAX INTO THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY LAYING ON THE BLOCK

BASICALLY IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE KIND OF STRESSED OUT YOU'RE FEELING THAT STRESS LEVEL TO KIND OF THAT YOU'LL TAKE THE WET AND WHAT KIND OF STRESS A LOT OF TIMES THAT DOES IT RAISES THAT FIGHTER FLIGHT CENTER RESPONSE IN YOUR BODY
GRAB BY THE SIGNS LEAN BACK SLIGHTLY GRABS NEVER HAND GRIP AND BRING THE ELBOWS CLOSE THE BODY AND ROLL BACK SQUEEZE THE SHOULDER BLADES TOGETHER
HYDRATION IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO GETTING YOURSELF OUT OF OBESITY BECAUSE IT CLEANS THE TOXINS OUT OF YOUR BODY
SO JUST A COUPLE THINGS YOU NEED TO REMEMBER MAKE SHORT A HEAD FIRST ENTRY YOUR SHOULDERS THEIR HANDS OR ABOVE YOUR SHOULDER MAKES YOUR HANDS TOUCH FIRST IN THE FIRST MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FEET TOUCH FIRST DON'T TWIST YOUR BODY
WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING THE GOOD SQUAT YOUR CORE IS REALLY HOLDING YOUR BODY INTO POSITION CORRECTLY
I'M NOT CUTTING TO FILL IN THE BODY
ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOUR BODY AND WHENEVER YOUR BODY IS TALKING TO YOU WHETHER IT'S TELLING YOU PAINT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ALWAYS REMEMBER TO FOLLOW WHAT YOUR BODY SAYS
THESE ARE JUST A FEW THE FACTS ABOUT BODY PIERCING JEWELRY
THE WITHIN THE BODY IN THIS NEXT SEGMENT WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT IS CHEAP

YOUR MANUALING AND YOUR UPPER BODY AND YOUR SHOULDERS ARE GOING TO PREDICT THE DIRECTION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TURN
ONE WAY TO DO THIS IS TO SET UP THE MANUAL POSITION SO THAT YOUR BODY IS TURNED JUST BEFORE YOU WANT TO BE OUT
SO NOT ONLY CAN YOU SPRAY YOUR BODY IT YOU CAN SPRAY THE ROOM YOU CAN SPRAY YOUR CAR YOU CAN SPRAY ANYTHING YOU WANT
NOW NOTICE MY HANDS ARE NINE OUT TO THE SIDE BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE CORRECT BODY POSITION
IN THIS SECTION WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LOWER BODY MECHANICS AS YOU'RE APPROACHING A FIVE LOW ON A HANDRAIL FEATURE
