HI MY NAME IS SHAWN VIEW
THIS IS COOL THE YOUR GMAIL INBOX AND JUST GIVE YOU A QUICK LITTLE LOOK AT WHAT'S NEW IN YOUR GMAIL ACCOUNT WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING TO GO THERE SO YOU KIND OF THINK A KIND OF GETTING AN IDEA OF HOW YOU CAN EVERYTHING THAT YOU USE ON THE WEB ARE MOST EVERYTHING YOU CAN ADD TO YOUR EYE GOOGLE HOMEPAGE AND KIND OF GET A QUICK VIEW OF IT IN BUT WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO ALL THESE DIFFERENT SITES
IF YOU GET A BIGGER VIEW YOU'LL ALSO SEE SHE'S WEARING OF HER PANTS MAKERS AND OF FENCING SNEAKERS FENCING SHOES AS WELL
AND THEN YOU CAN CLICK BLOCK THIS USER AND NOW THIS USE YOUR IS NOW BLOCKED AND ON THIS PAGE IT SAYS BLOCK USERS SO KEEPS A RUNNING TOTAL OR SHOWS ALL PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE BLOCKED AND THEY CAN NO LONGER VIEW YOUR PROFILE FORCE YOUR PICTURES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU UNBLOCK THEM
FOR ANGLE LIVE I'LL SHOW YOU ON THE PASSENGER SIDE IT GIVES A LITTLE BIT BETTER VIEW FROM OUR A CURVE FILMING LOCATION
HI I'M ROKOSZ YOUR DIGITAL LIFESTYLE EXPERT AS SUCH GOING TO THE CD OR MUSIC OR VIEW THERE I RECORD STORE IS A LITTLE ARE CANE FOR ME
I CUT OFF A TEAR FAN THE VIEW SALINE AND THE SPEEDO ARE WOMEN'S VENT WISHERS
AND TO DO THAT I'VE ISOLATED EACH FACE AND PUT THEM ON DIFFERENT LAYERS SO THAT WHEN THE TOP LAYER IS THE FRONT VIEW AND THE BOTTOM LAYER IS THE SIDE VIEW
NOW JUST BECAUSE THE AUTOMATION VIEW IS ON DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY READING ANY TYPE OF AUTOMATION
WHEN GOING ONTO YOUR SCREEN RIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT IN YOUR RANGE WINDOW PRESSING A WILL OPEN ACTUAL AUTOMATION VIEW
SO FOR PHOTOGRAPHING ARE BEAUTIFUL MODEL HERE AND WE DON'T WANT THIS LIGHT HITTING THE LENS WHICH CAUSES FLARING AND CAUSE ALL KIND OF PROBLEMS WE JUST BRING THIS AND THIS IS REALLY KIND OF HANDY ACTUALLY MEANT FOR STUDIO USE AND WE JUST MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T SHOW IN THE VIEW FINDER IN A BOX OF LIGHT FROM THIS FROM HITTING THE CAMERA
THIS IS A VIEW FINDER SO YOU CAN USE EITHER THE DEFENDER ARE YOUR LCD PANEL BACK
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S REAL IMPORTANT IS WHAT WE CALL NEUTRAL PHRASING AND NEUTRAL PHRASING IS ASKING THE QUESTION IN SUCH A WAY THAT I DO NOT SENSE YOUR VIEW ON IT
NOW SAY YOU'VE WRITTEN IN YOUR AUTOMATION VIA DRAWING OR THE FADER MOVEMENT AND YOU'VE DONE THAT VIEW OF USING THE RIGHT MODE
THE ONLY REAL RISK THAT THERE ISN'T WORKING WITH A CIRCUIT BOARDS FROM ELECTRONICS POINT OF VIEW IS YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT MAKE A BENDER TRY SOMETHING OUT THAT MIGHT FRY SOMETHING IN THE CIRCUIT BOARD LIKE YOU MIGHT FREYA CAPACITOR OR YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU KNOW IF YOU SEND LIKE A LOT OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE BOARD YOU KNOW TOO CLOSE TO THE POWER SOURCE OR TOO CLOSE TO YOUR CAPACITORS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE MAKE SURE OUR REAR VIEW MIRROR CLEAN MAKE SURE OUR INSTRUMENT CLUSTERS ARE CLEAN
LIKEWISE HAVING YOUR FEET ARE SITUATED IN PLACES WHERE YOU CAN SEE THEM IS IMPORTANT SO YOU WANT TO PUT THEM IN A PLACE WHERE YOU HAVE READY A VIEW ABILITY FROM A WINDOW OR WHATEVER
AND SO FOR ME FROM MY EXPERIENCE I THINK ENDORPHINS HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH A YOUR ABILITY TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING THAT IS A IN IT IS TO MY PLENTY VIEW IS IT'S PRETTY RARE BECAUSE YOU'RE AT SUCH MAXIMUM FOCUSING CONCENTRATION THAT NOTHING AROUND YOU EVEN MATTERS
WE SEE HERE THE ONE THAT I CLICKED ON WAS A LIMITED PREVIEW BUT YOU SEE HERE THERE'S A FULL VIEW
MOST OF OUR LIMITED PREVIEW BUT WE DID FIND ONE WITH A FULL VIEW
WE SEE THAT THAT IS THE VIEW PC COAT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX OF THE HARD DRIVE
NOW WHAT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU NEXT IS THE MIXER VIEW
THE MIXER VIEW IS ABOVE THE MIX WINDOW
AND THE FIRST THING WE WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO CHANGE MY VIEW
