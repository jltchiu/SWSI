ANOTHER NICE FEATURE OF THE OR OPTION WITH THE OLD TEE AND SOME OTHER HEARING AIDS IS WHAT WE CALL HUTU'S COMPATIBILITY WHICH GIVES YOU THE ABILITY TO LISTEN TO YOUR CELL PHONE IPOD THROUGH YOU'RE HEARING INSTRUMENT
AS I CLIP THEN YOU KNOW YOU CAN EVEN CELL JUST JUST STUCK BALANCING
MAKE SURE YOU TRY TO TURN YOUR CELL PHONE ON VIBRATE OR SILENT OR EVEN OFF
CELL AND AND ACTUALLY IT PROBABLY EFFECTS OF A CAN PROBABLY A FACT A LOT OF OTHER DISEASES IN CONDITIONS AS WELL BUT IT'S AGES HAVEN'T GOT TO THE QUITE
WE'RE GOING TO DO A HALF AN OUNCE OF A GIN THERE WE GO HALF AN OUNCE OF THE WHISKEY LEGS CELL AND HALF AN OUNCE OF OR NOT IT WAS A BRIGHT YELLOW COLOR JUST AN INTERESTING COLOR
SO WITH THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TURN OFF YOUR CELL PHONE TURN OFF YOUR TV TURN UP ANYTHING THAT CAN DISTRACT YOU
WE'RE GOING TO LEARN A RIFFLE CELL OLIVE YOU RIFFLE FAYETTE IF YOU EVER HEARD OF WHAT IT IS CALLED YOUR WHAT WE'VE DONE THE THREE TAP RIFF WHICH WAS BRUSH HEEL HEEL THAT WAS THREE SOUNDS AS WELL
START WITH THE INTRO RIGHT DOWN HOW MANY MEASURES IT HAPPENS FOR RIGHT DOWN THE VERSE RIGHT DOWN HOW MANY VERSUS THERE ARE WHEN THE CHORUS COMES IN RIGHT DOWN THE BRIDGE RIGHT ON THE CELL UP
ADD A LITTLE MORE A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION TO YOUR ARMS CELL STRETCH OUT THOSE MUSCLES SO YOU DON'T TEAR ANYTHING OR ANYTHING

OR WHEN YOU OPERATE THIS THING REMEMBER IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY HOT SO DON'T TOUCH THIS AFTER YOU'VE TURNED IT OFF BEING CAREFUL I BRING MY CELL MORE THAN ONCE
REMEMBER MOST DEALERSHIPS CAN'T CELL OR RESALE A CAR THAT HAS A SALVAGE TITLE SO YOU'RE USUALLY SAFE THEIR HOWEVER WHEN SHOPPING FOR A CAR FROM A PRIVATE PARTY MAKE SURE YOU FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THE CAR HAS A SALVAGE PADDLE
EVERY LITTLE CELL JUST A FINGERNAIL SCRATCHING OF THAT PLANT HAS ALL THE DIFFERENT MAKEUP FOR IT
IF IT'S FREE THAN THAT PERSON IS ON THE SAME CELL PHONE PROVIDER THAT YOU ARE ON
IF IT'S SOMEONE THAT YOU TALK TO QUITE OFTEN IF IT SHOWS THAT YOU'RE BEING CHARGE FOR THAT THAN THAT PERSON IS NOT ON YOUR CELL PHONE PROVIDER
ANOTHER OPTION YOU MIGHT HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE CELL PHONE PROVIDER WOULD BE TO LOOK ON YOUR CELL PHONE BILL
YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU HAVEN'T MADE A SLIT AND AFTER YOU SO IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE CELL CLOTH WITHOUT POKE A HOLE IN THE VINYL TOO
