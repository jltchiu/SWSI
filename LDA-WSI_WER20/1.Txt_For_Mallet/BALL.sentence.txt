gg3XNPOBTqk_2 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS HAVE YOUR PANTS AND YOUR FINGER SPREAD APART ON THE BALL LEFT HAND GUIDING THE BALL SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE IF YOU'VE GOT YOUR BALL TOWARDS THE BASKET
gg3XNPOBTqk_3 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS WHEN YOU LIFT UP YOUR BEND THE LEGS AND YOU MOVE UP WITH THE BALL WITH THIS HAND YOU GUIDE IT SO IT IS A GO IN ANY OTHER DIRECTION BESIDES AN ACTION THAT YOU'RE GOING IN TOWARDS YOU MOVE THE BALL UP AND YOU ROLL IT WITH YOUR FINGERS
GWCJn50YQoY_19 0 THIS ALLOWS YOU TO GO WITH THE BALL OF YOUR RACKET EDGE AND KIND OF BRUSH THE BALL YOU TO JUST SIT

gFAw9JA-pQc_20 0 IF YOU PUT THAT TOGETHER I GUARANTEE YOU ARE GOING TO HOOK THE BALL
gh6J2QPQPJE_12 0 BUT THE MAIN THING IS YOU WANT TO READ YOUR DEFENDER AND FIGURE OUT WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO SHOOT THE BALL AFTER CATCHING IT AND GET IT READY
gqwDE8NtLoA_9 0 THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT AND I DON'T SUGGEST THAT YOU PRACTICE IT TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE READY TO JUGGLE SIX BALL BEFORE TRYING THIS TRICK BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO AT LEAST BE ABLE TO FLASH THE BALLS IN ONE HAND TO REALLY DO THIS

gFAw9JA-pQc_17 0 THEN BEFORE THE BALL FURTHER BACK IN YOUR STANCE
gZXd5wK4rW4_4 0 SO THE PROBLEM WITH HITTING OFF OF THIS IS YOU CAN'T GET THE CLUB UNDERNEATH THE BALL THAT YOU CAN IN GRASS OR SAND OR EVEN LOOSE IMPEDIMENTS
gZXd5wK4rW4_9 0 AND THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN LOSE A LOT OF STROKES IS WHEN YOU HIT A SKILL YOU IN YOUR SKULL BALL YOU CAN GO INTO WATER SAND TREES WHO KNOWS WHERE
gZXd5wK4rW4_8 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO LINE UP LIKE YOU TO NORMAL SHOT BUT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT BEING SUPER RELAX BECAUSE YOU CAN IF YOU TRY TO MUSCLE THIS BALL BALL WHAT HAPPENS IS OFF HARD PAN THE CLUB HITS THE HARD PAN AND THEN SKIPS INTO THE BACK OF THE BALL PRODUCING A SKULL SHOT

hJ_CfDvv_sw_22 0 THE BALL IS THROWN WITHIN HIS OWN OF CATCHING ABILITY BUT IT'S SOMEHOW GOT PAST
hJ_CfDvv_sw_20 0 NOW PASSED BALL IS VERY SIMILAR TO A WILD PITCH
hJ_CfDvv_sw_21 0 THAT MEANS THAT THE CATCHER SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT THE BALL BUT DID
g_cCqfIxhWE_3 0 SO BASICALLY WHAT IT IS IS IT'S TWO PLAYERS TO TURN THEIR STICKS OF WITH THE BACKS TOWARDS EACH OTHER WITH THE BALL IN THE MIDDLE AND YOU HAVE BOTH HANDS ON THE STICK THEM TO DO WITHOUT THE BALL AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GET UP UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND FLING THE BALL ABOVE YOUR HEADS AND THEN ALL THE THAT TEAMMATES KIND OF MOVING TO TRY TO GET THE BALL AND GRAB POSSESSION
g_cCqfIxhWE_7 0 SO THE REFEREE WILL PLACE THE BALL I IT WITH IN THE BACK OF YOUR STICK AND YOU SET UP AND YOU'LL WAIT FOR THE WHISTLE BUT WE'RE JUST GOING TO COUNT OF THREE OKAY
g_cCqfIxhWE_4 0 AND SO TO WIN A DRY YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STURDY AND THAT YOUR LEGS ARE PLANETS FIRMLY AND IT YOU DON'T HAVE A GOOD GRIP ON YOUR STICK AND THE WAY YOU WHEN IT IS GET UNDERNEATH THE BALL REALLY QUICK AND AND HIT UP

hF48m-fxAGo_2 0 FIRST YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR BALL OF CLAY AND YOU WANT IT TO BE AS ROUNDS POSSIBLE THAT MAKES CENTERING MUCH EASIER AND THROW IT DOWN PRETTY HARD RIGHT ON THE CENTER OF THE WHEEL
HbQDnZ3-X3I_2 0 THE OVERHEAD PASS IS EFFECTIVE DURING THE GAME WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF SPACE BETWEEN YOU AND THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PASS IT TO AND YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO GET IN THERE WITH SOME ZIP SO THAT THE DEFENSE DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO GET IN BETWEEN AND TRY TO STEAL THE BALL
H7JNrI8IDMY_3 0 BUT IF THE BALL IS IN THE AIR AND YOU HIT IT THAT'S A VOLLEY
H7JNrI8IDMY_2 0 ALL OF OLLIE IS BECAUSE YOU'RE TAKING THE BALL BEFORE IT BOUNCES SO OBVIOUSLY THE BALL BOUNCES LIKE THIS THAT'S A GROUND STROKE

GzykffdDnmE_28 0 THE CONTROL ARM ASSEMBLY HAS THE BALL JOINT ALREADY PRESSED IN IT
gqPmI__5g2k_2 0 WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR FEET TOGETHER YOU TRY TO DRAWING THE TOES TOGETHER THE BALL OFF WITH THE HEEL LOOK FOR
H764PyicDGo_4 0 YOU DON'T NEED TO LEARN THE BALL AND YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE YOUR OWN SPIN ON EACH INDIVIDUAL TRICK
H764PyicDGo_2 0 NOW CLUB JUGGLING TRICKS ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM BALL JUGGLING TRICKS
H1HAMTFXwqI_12 0 A WENDY'S CAT START TO DO SOME CLAWING BEHAVIOR ON AN APPROPRIATE OBJECTS IN THE HOUSE ONE THING IS YOU CAN DO IS YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME PLACE WHERE THEY CAN BALL
GYZLMMECK5k_9 0 THE SET MY TOOL DOWN TO GRAB MY NEW BALL JOINT AND SHOW YOU THE TAPER ON IT

gbvMqFhBqSU_2 0 IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CORRECT PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZE VEHICLE

hBIGDm-BdbI_4 0 BECAUSE IF YOUR GROIN MUSCLES ARE USED TO IT JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T STRAIN THE BALL
_GtKZbzWBig_12 0 TO GET OUT OF THIS BRING THE WEIGHTS DOWN DROP THE HIPS LIFT THE HEAD AND WALK YOURSELF BACK UP ON THE BALL
HeWsukelbVg_10 0 SO WE CAN SEE HERE THAT WE'VE GOT A POWER BALL DISPENSER ELEVATOR ADORE THAT'S WALKING A POWER BALL RECEPTACLE AND NOT ELEVATOR OVER HERE
GLIMfjVK8_s_13 0 I MIGHT WANT TO GIVE THAT A LITTLE BIT OF A BALL A LITTLE BIT THIS LITTLE BIT OF SHAPE SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND ROTATED BY USING THE TRANSFORM ROTATE TOOL AND PLACE IT A LITTLE BIT OFF CENTER MAYBE

GUPTKqn6eWs_10 0 WE DON'T WANT TO BE UP HERE WHERE YOUR LOWER BACK IS ON THE BALL AS YOU'RE PUSHING UP BECAUSE IT'S GOT A LOT OF STRAIN IN YOUR NECK SO AS YOU'RE SETTING UP KEEP YOUR FREE WEIGHTS DOWN BY YOUR SIDES AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME FROM A SEATED POSITION TO ROLL YOURSELF ALL THE WAY DOWN UNTIL YOU FEEL YOUR HEAD AND YOUR SHOULDERS TOUCH THE BALL

hiIHTYpRh8Y_1 0 OKAY THE SIXTY DEGREE WEDGE IS REALLY LOFTED AND ONE THING I FORGOT TO MENTION PREVIOUS SEGMENTS MAYBE IS THAT IF YOU OPEN THE FACE YOUR CLUB IT DOES INCREASED THE LOFT OF WHICH MEANS IT PUTS THE BALL HIGHER
hiIHTYpRh8Y_9 0 SO THE SIXTY DEGREE WEDGE IS ANOTHER WAY OF LOFTING THE BALL HIGH SO WHEN IT LANDS IT STOPS
GJrc-igSJX4_23 0 THE NEXT ONE WOULD BE PROBABLY FIGURE EIGHT DRIBBLE WHICH TAKE THE BALL DRIBBLE BETWEEN YOUR LEGS IN THE SAME SAME MOTION

GHocQ-7zyOo_1 0 OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO DIFFERENT SERVE WHICH IS THE WIDE SERVE SO MY GOAL IS TO HIT THE BALL SOMEWHERE I ABOVE MY RACK I'VE TO RIGHT HERE THE RED LINE THE REASON BEING IS WHEN THE BALL HITS IN THAT AREA BY THE OPPONENT DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF THE SHOT
GHocQ-7zyOo_2 0 THESE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE BALL OFF THE WALL OR YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET IT BEFORE BECAUSE THE WALL SO IF I HIT IT JUST RIGHT KEYS GET A VERY VERY WEAK SHOT SO
GHocQ-7zyOo_5 0 SO BY HITTING THE BALL UP HERE OVER MY OPPONENT IS FORCED TO TAKE THE BALL HIGH WITH HIS BACKHAND OR YOU JUST TAKE THE WRIST OF LETTING HIM COME OFF THE BACK WALL OR DYING BACK HERE SO THIS IS A VERY VERY EFFECTIVE SHOT SO ONCE YOU'VE MASTERED THE TECHNICAL SKILLS OF JUST HITTING THE BALL IN A DECENT MANNER YOU WANT TO START INCORPORATING HITTING IT TO SPOTS ON THE SIDE WALL TO MAKE YOUR SERVE THAT MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE

h2VKacwXr_w_5 0 THIS EFFECT BACK IS REALLY GOING TO TEACH YOU THE HABIT OF COMMON TO THE CORRECT IMPACT POSITION AND IF YOU NOTICE HERE MY WEIGHT IS WELL INTO MY LEFT SIDE THE CLUB FACE IS BEHIND MY HANDS SO MY HANDS HER HEAD AND IN THIS POSITION I'M ABLE TO HIT DOWN ON THE BALL
