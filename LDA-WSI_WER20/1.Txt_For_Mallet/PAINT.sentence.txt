GDRGPctnjW4_6 0 SO AGAIN SYSTEMICALLY THERE'S A GRAY CORRELATION TO THE LOW BACK AND HOW THINGS WORK AS WELL AS WAS PAINT
GDRGPctnjW4_2 0 WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO IS THAT THE SPINE IS REALLY THE HOUSE THAT PROTECTS THE NERVES THAT ARE TRANSMITTING THESE MESSAGES AND SO AS THE SPINE GETS MISALIGNED AS THE SPINE BECOMES TORQUED TWISTED WHAT HAVE YOU IT PUTS PRESSURE ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT THEN ASCENDING THE MESSAGES OUT AND WHICH CAN BE PAINT OR FUNCTION
