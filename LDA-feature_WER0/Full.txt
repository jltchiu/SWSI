gk0hmh49gCQ_1 0 HI I'M SCOTT REIL AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT PERENNIAL GARDENING
gk0hmh49gCQ_2 0 WORKING WITH COLOR IN THE GARDEN IS IMPERATIVE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PERENNIAL GARDENING
gk0hmh49gCQ_3 0 PERENNIAL GARDENS ARE BY THEIR NATURE MOSTLY ABOUT FLOWER POWER AND FLOWERS ARE MOSTLY ABOUT COLOR
gk0hmh49gCQ_4 0 SO WHAT ARE SOME DIFFERENT WAYS TO WORK WITH COLOR IN THE GARDEN
gk0hmh49gCQ_5 0 YOU CAN SEE HERE IN THIS GARDEN I'VE CHOSEN TO WORK WITH SOFT COLORS
gk0hmh49gCQ_6 0 MOSTLY PASTEL TYPE COLORS FROM THE SOFT PASTEL BLUE ON THE NAPATA HERE TO THE SOFT PINK ON THE THERESE BUGNET ROSE
gk0hmh49gCQ_7 0 SOFT COLORS ARE WORKING FOR ME OUT HERE
gk0hmh49gCQ_8 0 A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE WILL WANT TO MIX LOTS OF DIFFERENT COLORS IN THE GARDEN AND GENERALLY I THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE
gk0hmh49gCQ_9 0 I CALL IT SPILLING THE PAINT BOX BY DESIGN
gk0hmh49gCQ_10 0 IT NEVER REALLY WORKS OUT
gk0hmh49gCQ_11 0 YOUR EYE NEVER REALLY KNOWS WHERE TO FOCUS IT DOESN'T TRAVEL EASILY OR WELL DOWN THE BORDER
gk0hmh49gCQ_12 0 BUT IF YOU CONTINUALLY REPEAT THE SAME PLANTS AND THE SAME COLORS THROUGHOUT IT CREATES A NICE EASY FLOW FOR THE EYE ONE THAT WORKS WELL
gk0hmh49gCQ_13 0 NOW YOU CAN USE HOT COLORS IN THE GARDEN AND THAT'S AN EXCITING WAY TO DO THE DESIGN AND TO BUILD YOUR PERENNIAL GARDEN TOO BUT IT TAKES A REALLY SKILLED EYE AND A SKILLED HAND
gk0hmh49gCQ_14 0 YOU WANT TO STAY WITH THE REDS THE YELLOWS AND THE ORANGES USING WHITES AND MAYBE TO OCCASIONAL BLUE TO COOL THINGS DOWN A LITTLE BIT
gk0hmh49gCQ_15 0 BUT REMEMBERING WHERE YOU ARE ON THE COLOR WHEEL AND MATCHING AND MIXING YOUR COLORS APPROPRIATELY IS GONNA WORK FOR YOU IN ALL TYPES OF GARDENING BUT ESPECIALLY IN PERENNIAL GARDENING
gnPHNrBdiBg_1 0 THIS NIKYO THIS WRIST CONTROL IS FROM TWO HANDS GRABBED FROM THE FRONT
gnPHNrBdiBg_2 0 ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO DROP MY CENTER
gnPHNrBdiBg_3 0 THIS TIME I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO EXECUTE THE WRIST TECHNIQUE ON BOTH THE WRIST
gnPHNrBdiBg_4 0 AND COMING BACK MY HANDS GOING TO FLOW OUT AND AROUND THE WRIST AND I LIKE TO PRESS THESE BY DRIVING THEM IN AT AN ANGLE LIKE THIS
gnPHNrBdiBg_5 0 SO I'M HERE AND TOWARD AND ESSENTIALLY JAMMING DANIEL INTO THE GROUND
gnPHNrBdiBg_6 0 FROM HERE JUST GOING TO ROCK HIM BACK
gnPHNrBdiBg_7 0 LET'S TRY THAT ONE MORE TIME
gnPHNrBdiBg_8 0 TWO HANDS GRABBED FROM THE FRONT AND MOVE BACK BEGIN TO FEEL HIS CENTER
gnPHNrBdiBg_9 0 MY HANDS FLOW AROUND HIM LIKE WATER
gnPHNrBdiBg_10 0 MY FINGERS DRIVE IN DOWN TOWARDS HIS CENTER JUST BELOW HIS BELLY BUTTON
gnPHNrBdiBg_11 0 BACK WE GO
gnPHNrBdiBg_12 0 ONE MORE TIME
gnPHNrBdiBg_13 0 LET'S DO IT A LITTLE MORE FLUIDLY
gnPHNrBdiBg_14 0 DOWN WE GO
gnPHNrBdiBg_15 0 THAT IS NIKYO OR WRIST LOCK AGAINST TWO HANDS GRABBED FROM THE FRONT ALSO KNOWN AS RIYOTEDORI
Ge0XcVD1xtY_1 0 IN THIS VIDEO WE ARE GOING TO REVIEW HOW TO PREPARE YOUR TABLE FOR SCREEN PRINTING
Ge0XcVD1xtY_2 0 YOU NEED YOUR TABLETOP GLUE AND YOU NEED A PIECE OF MATTE BOARD
Ge0XcVD1xtY_3 0 YOU NEED PACKING TAPE YOUR ACETATE AND THE NEWSPRINT
Ge0XcVD1xtY_4 0 IT'S IMPORTANT TO GLUE DOWN THE TABLE AND THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THE PAPER THAT YOU'RE PRINTING ON ACTUALLY STICKS TO THE TABLE
Ge0XcVD1xtY_5 0 INK IS SUPER STICKY AND WILL CREATE A VACUUM-LIKE EFFECT WHEN YOU PRINT
Ge0XcVD1xtY_6 0 SO YOU WANT SOMETHING TO JUST HELP HOLD IT DOWN
Ge0XcVD1xtY_7 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO APPLY A THIN LAYER OF GLUE TO THE SURFACE OF YOUR TABLE
Ge0XcVD1xtY_8 0 BUT WE DON'T WANT IT TO STAY THERE THE WHOLE TIME
Ge0XcVD1xtY_9 0 SO THEN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A PIECE OF NEWSPRINT AND WE'RE GOING TO GENTLY RUB IT OVER TOP REMOVING THE EXCESS
Ge0XcVD1xtY_10 0 DO THIS A FEW TIMES I'D SAY FOUR OR FIVE TIMES SO WE HAVE A LIGHT TACK
Ge0XcVD1xtY_11 0 IT FEELS PRETTY GOOD TO ME
Ge0XcVD1xtY_12 0 THEN YOU'RE GOING TO APPLY YOUR ACETATE
Ge0XcVD1xtY_13 0 ACETATE IS USED FOR REGISTRATION PURPOSES
Ge0XcVD1xtY_14 0 YOU WANT TO KNOW AT ALL TIMES WHERE YOUR IMAGE IS GOING TO COME DOWN ON THE PAPER AND THE TABLE
Ge0XcVD1xtY_15 0 LAY YOU ACETATE OVER TOP TAKE A PIECE OF PACKING TAPE RUN IT DOWN THE SIDE OVER HERE AND MAKE SURE IT'S NICE AND SMOOTH
Ge0XcVD1xtY_16 0 THE GLUE WILL ALSO HELP TO HOLD THE ACETATE
Ge0XcVD1xtY_17 0 LIFT IT UP AND PUT DOWN THE SECOND PIECE ENSURING THAT IT WON'T SLIP OR MOVE AND THEN YOUR TABLE IS READY FOR SCREEN PRINTING
Goe0tuJ7V28_1 0 HI WE'RE NOW GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF CENTERING BEFORE YOUR YOGA PRACTICE
Goe0tuJ7V28_2 0 IT'S IMPORTANT TO CREATE A SPACE BETWEEN WHAT YOU'VE JUST BEEN DOING IN YOUR LIFE MAYBE JUST COMING FROM WORK ACTUALLY MAYBE JUST GETTING UP IN THE MORNING AND YOUR YOGA PRACTICE ITSELF SO IT'S LIKE YOU WANT TO BOOKEND IT
Goe0tuJ7V28_3 0 SO THE CENTERING PART IS THE FIRST BOOKEND AND THE RELAXATION AT THE END IS THE SECOND BOOKEND AND YOU HAVE THE ENTIRE PRACTICE IN THE CENTER
Goe0tuJ7V28_4 0 SO THIS FIRST CENTERING BOOKEND IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CREATE THAT SPACE AND ALLOW YOU TO GO INSIDE AND CREATE AN INTENTION PERHAPS TO REALLY GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR BODY TO BRING THAT MIND-BODY CONNECTION TOGETHER BEFORE YOU BRING BEGIN YOUR PRACTICE
Goe0tuJ7V28_5 0 IT'S TO LEAVE BEHIND THE REST OF THE WORLD YOUR WORRIES YOUR CONCERNS ALL THOSE MUNDANE THINGS OUT IN THE WORLD AND TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO SIT ON THE MAT AND PREPARE FOR YOUR PRACTICE
Goe0tuJ7V28_6 0 IT ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR BREATHING TO YOUR THOUGHTS TO THE SENSATIONS IN YOUR BODY IN ORDER TO BE SAFE AND IN ORDER TO KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GO FROM THAT MOMENT ON
G_CdA_PRjpc_1 0 IN A SINGLE STRAIGHT LEG STRETCH TAKE YOUR RIGHT HAND ON THE BACK OF THE RIGHT LEG FOR THE HAMSTRING
G_CdA_PRjpc_2 0 AND TAKE YOUR LEFT HAND DOWN TO THAT RIGHT ANKLE
G_CdA_PRjpc_3 0 IT CAN BE DONE IN DIFFERENT LEVELS YOU CAN BE UP ON YOUR TAIL BONE YOU CAN COME DOWN YOUR LOWER BACK
G_CdA_PRjpc_4 0 SOME PEOPLE IF THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WHERE THEIR NECK BOTHERS THEM CAN LAY THE HEAD DOWN
G_CdA_PRjpc_5 0 PUSH FORWARD TO CONNECT DEEPER INTO THE BACK AND THE ABDOMINALS HOLD YOUR HEAD UP
G_CdA_PRjpc_6 0 NOW TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN AND SWITCH BOTH LEGS OVER TOWARDS THE LEFT LEG AND YOU'RE BRINGING THAT LEG IN STRAIGHT TOWARDS YOU AND THEN EXHALE SWITCH
G_CdA_PRjpc_7 0 AND INHALE SWITCH
G_CdA_PRjpc_8 0 INHALE AND EXHALE USE THE BREATH
G_CdA_PRjpc_9 0 INHALING AND EXHALING
G_CdA_PRjpc_10 0 EXTENDING WITH THE TOES AND AGAIN IF YOUR NECK BOTHERS YOU BRING YOUR HEAD DOWN
G_CdA_PRjpc_11 0 BUT IT WON'T WORK AS DEEPER INTO THE BACK AND ABDOMINAL MUSCLES AS IT IS WHEN YOU LIFT THE HEAD UP
G_CdA_PRjpc_12 0 AND UP BACK AND FORTH
G_CdA_PRjpc_13 0 POINTING LIKE SOMEBODY'S GOT YOU RIGHT BY THE TOES AND YOU'RE REACHING
G_CdA_PRjpc_14 0 ONE MORE TIME
G_CdA_PRjpc_15 0 DEEP BREATH IN AND A DEEP BREATH OUT
G_CdA_PRjpc_16 0 AND LAY RIGHT DOWN

gVxLv-kpHP4_25 0 THEN THERE THIS
gVxLv-kpHP4_26 0 THIS IS COPAL
gVxLv-kpHP4_27 0 THIS IS WHAT YOU GET BEFORE IT TURNS INTO AMBER
gVxLv-kpHP4_28 0 THIS ISN'T QUITE AS OLD AS AMBER BUT IT MAKES A REALLY RICH LOOK
gVxLv-kpHP4_29 0 ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE USING IT WITH BIG RED MOUNTAIN CORAL AND TURQUOISE
gVxLv-kpHP4_30 0 AGAIN BIT IN TIBET AND NEPAL
gVxLv-kpHP4_31 0 THESE COLORS THEY FELT WERE VERY PROTECTIVE

G-VRHmkiqtc_1 0 MY NAME IS ANTHONY MADDALONI AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT PUTTING PHOTOGRAPHIC EMULSION ONTO WATERCOLOR PAPER
G-VRHmkiqtc_2 0 NOW PHOTOGRAPHS HAVE AN EMULSION ON THEM
G-VRHmkiqtc_3 0 AND WHAT I CAN DO IS I CAN HEAT UP THIS EMULSION AND LIGHT TIGHT SPACE USING A RED PHOTOGRAPHIC SAFE LIGHT
G-VRHmkiqtc_4 0 AND I CAN PAINT THIS PHOTOGRAPHIC EMULSION ONTO WATERCOLOR PAPER
G-VRHmkiqtc_5 0 AND THEN I CAN PRINT USING TRADITIONAL PHOTOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES IN A DARK ROOM
G-VRHmkiqtc_6 0 AND I LIKE THIS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I CAN MAKE PHOTOGRAPHS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY JUST FLAT ON PLASTIC
G-VRHmkiqtc_7 0 I CAN PUT THEM ON WATERCOLOR PAPER I CAN MAKE CARDS OUT OF THEM I CAN MAKE EVEN REALLY BEAUTIFUL PAINTERLY-ESQUE IMAGES
G-VRHmkiqtc_8 0 AND SO THAT IS ONE WAY THAT I CAN KIND OF CREATE A STYLE FOR MYSELF USING PHOTOGRAPHIC EMULSION THAT I'VE PAINTED ONTO WATERCOLOR PAPER
GYw8hXrIxb8_1 0 ONCE AGAIN MY NAME IS ED WILLIAMS AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I HAVE SHARED QUIET A FEW THINGS WITH YOU TODAY MAINLY I SHARED THE CONCEPTS OF BEING FIT FOR LIFE
GYw8hXrIxb8_2 0 THE WHOLE IDEA OF MAKING A TRANSITION FROM A SETTLE TO A MORE ACTIVE LIFESTYLE
GYw8hXrIxb8_3 0 I HAVE SHARED SOME EXERCISES YOU CAN UTILIZE TO BEGIN YOUR DAY AND STARTING TO MAKE THAT TRANSITION
GYw8hXrIxb8_4 0 WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT DIETING AND HYDRATION AND ALSO SPOKE ABOUT ENERGY SOURCES
GYw8hXrIxb8_5 0 NOW I HOPE THAT THE INFORMATION I PROVIDED YOU WITH TODAY THAT YOU WOULD FIND THAT INFORMATION VERY USEFUL I RECOMMEND THAT YOU GO AHEAD AND MAKE THAT SWITCH
GYw8hXrIxb8_6 0 THIS BODY OF OURS WAS DESIGNED FOR A ACTIVE LIFESTYLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
gQXdQ6WXA4Y_1 0 OK ALL OF THESE BASS LINES THAT WE'RE LEARNING COMING UP IN COUNTRY AND BLUES STYLE ARE GOING TO BE PLAYED PIZZICATO USING THE FINGERS OF THE RIGHT HAND TO SOUND THE STRINGS
gQXdQ6WXA4Y_2 0 SO LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT BEFORE WE GO ON
gQXdQ6WXA4Y_3 0 REMEMBER TO KEEP REVIEWING ALL OF THESE TECHNIQUES THE BOW AND THE FINGERS AS MUCH AS YOU NEED TO
gQXdQ6WXA4Y_4 0 RIGHT NOW LET'S FOCUS ON THE RIGHT HAND
gQXdQ6WXA4Y_5 0 WHEN WE'RE ON THAT G STRING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE YOUR FINGERS CROSS WAYS TO IT NOT ON THE DIAGONAL
gQXdQ6WXA4Y_6 0 I PREFER CROSS WAYS
gQXdQ6WXA4Y_7 0 AND YOU'RE GOING TO PULL SO THAT IT'S THIS TOP OF YOUR FINGER GOING ACROSS TO MAKE THAT SOUND
gQXdQ6WXA4Y_8 0 YOU DON'T YOU CAN SNAP IT
gQXdQ6WXA4Y_9 0 BUT THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT EFFECT THAT WE'RE NOT DOING RIGHT NOW
gQXdQ6WXA4Y_10 0 ON THE D STRING YOU'RE GOING TO FIND JUST REST YOUR FINGER AGAINST THE A'S
gQXdQ6WXA4Y_11 0 YOU CAN GO BACK IN NICE EVEN TIME
gQXdQ6WXA4Y_12 0 SAME THING WHEN YOU GET TO THE A STRING
gQXdQ6WXA4Y_13 0 WHEN YOU GET TO THE E STRING YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO KEEP YOUR THUMB THERE ON THE FINGER BOARD
gQXdQ6WXA4Y_14 0 AND IF YOU TRY TO KEEP GETTING THAT GOOD TONE EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T HAVE THE STRING TO SNAP INTO
gQXdQ6WXA4Y_15 0 SO THE E STRING CAN BE A LITTLE TRICKIER
gQXdQ6WXA4Y_16 0 AND YOU CAN EVEN HEAR
gQXdQ6WXA4Y_17 0 YOU HEAR THAT THAT HIT IS PART OF THE SOUND AND THAT'S A BIG THING WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING THIS PERCUSSIVE TYPE OF BASS
gQXdQ6WXA4Y_18 0 ALWAYS COMING TO REST ON THE NEXT STRING
GVssAhApfGg_1 0 NOW WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS CAT BITES
GVssAhApfGg_2 0 IN VETERINARY MEDICINE WE ARE ALWAYS AT RISK OF GETTING BITTEN BY ONE OF THESE ANIMALS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON
GVssAhApfGg_3 0 CATS UNFORTUNATELY HAVE A LOT OF BACTERIA IN THEIR MOUTHS AND CAN LITERALLY INJECT THAT BACTERIA INTO YOU
GVssAhApfGg_4 0 CATS HAVE LARGE CANINE TEETH WHICH ARE USED FOR PROTECTION
GVssAhApfGg_5 0 THEY ALSO HAVE QUITE A BIT OF BACTERIAL TARTAR ON THEIR TEETH AND THIS BACTERIA CAN BE INJECTED INTO YOUR HAND OR YOUR ARM IF YOU ARE BITTEN AND THIS ACTUALLY CAN MAKE YOU VERY SICK AND REQUIRE MEDICAL ATTENTION
GVssAhApfGg_6 0 BACTERIA CAN GET UNDER YOUR SKIN AND UNFORTUNATELY CAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS
GVssAhApfGg_7 0 IT CAN CAUSE ABSCESSES AND LITERALLY MOVE UP YOUR ARM OR YOUR HAND AND CAUSE DAMAGE TO YOUR TENDONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO THE FIRST THING TO DO IS USE AN ANTIBACTERIAL SOAP AND THOROUGHLY THOROUGHLY THOROUGHLY CLEANSE THAT WOUND
GVssAhApfGg_8 0 THE SECOND THING TO DO IS SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION FROM A HUMAN PHYSICIAN BECAUSE LIKE I SAID THESE BITES CAN BECOME VERY VERY INFECTED AND LITERALLY TURN VERY BAD AND TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY REQUIRE SURGERY
h8lMozsztuQ_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS TONY CAPRARO SENSEI OF KYOKUSHIN KARATE WITHOUT LIMITS INC 1652 RICHMOND AVENUE STATEN ISLAND NEW YORK
h8lMozsztuQ_2 0 WE ARE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT TO YOU BASIC KYOKUSHIN TECHNIQUE
h8lMozsztuQ_3 0 ONE OF THE MORE DEVASTATING KICKS IN KYOKUSHIN BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTING IS THE INSIDE LOW KICK APPLIED WITH THE LEFT LEG TO THE LEFT LEG
h8lMozsztuQ_4 0 SO WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IS IT IS A KICK THAT'S TARGETED TO THE INNER MENISCUS AREA LIKE SO
h8lMozsztuQ_5 0 NOW THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO GUARD AGAINST THIS
h8lMozsztuQ_6 0 YOU DO NOT WANT TO TAKE THIS KICK TO MUCH BECAUSE IT COULD TOTALLY DAMAGE YOUR LEG SO WHEN A PERSON THROWS THE KICK HERE'S ONE WAY TO DEFEND AGAINST THE KICK
h8lMozsztuQ_7 0 YOU PULL THE LEG AWAY COMPLETELY
h8lMozsztuQ_9 0 OR HE THROWS THE KICK YOU STEP OFF TO THE RIGHT
h8lMozsztuQ_10 0 OR THROW THE KICK YOU TAKE THE KICK AND GO BACK ROLL WITH THE KICK
hfTGKtfivm4_1 0 OKAY THIS NEXT TECHNIQUE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE ADVANCED
hfTGKtfivm4_2 0 WE WANT TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS WITH IT
hfTGKtfivm4_3 0 WE'RE JUST GOING TO APPLY THE SAME TECHNIQUE THAT WE DID AND ADD A LITTLE TWIST TO IT
hfTGKtfivm4_4 0 THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF GETTING INTO THESE TECHNIQUES
hfTGKtfivm4_5 0 YOU HAVE TO FIND WHICH ONE WORKS BEST
hfTGKtfivm4_6 0 AND YOU KNOW SOME THINGS DON'T NECESSARILY FIT EACH INDIVIDUAL BODY TYPE
hfTGKtfivm4_7 0 AND SOME OF THE TECHNIQUES DON'T SEEM TO MATCH AS WELL
hfTGKtfivm4_8 0 YOU MIGHT MODIFY OR GO INTO ANOTHER THING
hfTGKtfivm4_9 0 THAT'S WHY WE DID MODIFICATION FOR THE TONTODORI OR WHAT NOT
hfTGKtfivm4_10 0 SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE INSIDE
hfTGKtfivm4_11 0 SO HE'S GOING TO ATTACK HE DOES A TSUKI WE CAN GO HERE
hfTGKtfivm4_12 0 THEN WE'LL DRAW BRING THIS UP
hfTGKtfivm4_13 0 AS WE'RE GOING THROUGH I'M GOING TO STEP GET MY HIPS IN THE WAY AND BRING HIM UP
hfTGKtfivm4_14 0 THIS SHOULD BE FAIRLY COMFORTABLE
hfTGKtfivm4_15 0 YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO WALK AROUND LIKE THIS ALL DAY AND IT'S REALLY THE BENDING THE TWISTING OF THE HIPS THAT'S GOING TO DO THE THROW
hfTGKtfivm4_16 0 IT'S NOT A BIG CRANKING HIM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
hfTGKtfivm4_17 0 SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO COME IN SAME THING
hfTGKtfivm4_18 0 BRING THIS BACK SCOOT OUR HIPS IN UP AND OVER
hfTGKtfivm4_22 0 FOR PRACTICE LET'S NOT THROW

hfTGKtfivm4_26 0 WE'RE GOING TO TENKAN SLIDE BACK IN AND THEN WE WANT TO GENTLY BRING HIM UP
hfTGKtfivm4_27 0 WOBBLE FOR A LITTLE BIT AND SET HIM BACK DOWN
hfTGKtfivm4_29 0 UP AND OVER
hfTGKtfivm4_30 0 ONCE YOU GET THIS FORWARD MOVE IT WITH YOUR HIPS
hfTGKtfivm4_31 0 TAKE A LITTLE STEP GET YOUR HIPS SET GET HIM LOADED
hfTGKtfivm4_32 0 SET FOR A LITTLE BIT MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT THE BALANCE AND SET HIM BACK UP GIVE THE JOD AND TRY AGAIN
gH8QCtHPeO4_1 0 WE HAVE GOOD FRAMING OF CAITLIN IN OUR FRAME AND THAT'S ABOUT PERFECT FOR A HEAD SHOT
gH8QCtHPeO4_2 0 WE WANT TO SHOW THE LENGTH OF HER HAIR
gH8QCtHPeO4_3 0 WE WANT TO SHOW THE COLOR OF HER HAIR
gH8QCtHPeO4_4 0 WE WANT TO ALSO SHOW HER FACE AND NOT MUCH MORE THAN THAT BUT WITHIN THAT FRAME THE NEXT THING THAT WE'LL REALLY DEAL WITH IS POSING AND THE POSES FOR A HEAD SHOT FOR A HEAD SHOT FOR AN ACTING OR A MODELING PORTFOLIO
gH8QCtHPeO4_5 0 THE POSING IS GOING TO BE VERY SUBTLE
gH8QCtHPeO4_6 0 WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE DOING RADICALLY WEIRD THINGS
gH8QCtHPeO4_7 0 THEY'RE PRIMARILY LOOKING TO SEE WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE IN HER FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AND HER CHARACTER SO THE KINDS OF POSES THAT WE'LL DEAL WITH ARE JUST SUBTLE THINGS LIKE
gH8QCtHPeO4_8 0 THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD FRAMING FOR A HEAD SHOT AND THAT'S CERTAINLY ADEQUATE BUT IT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE INTERESTING IF WE CAN JUST SHIFT HER SHOULDERS A LITTLE BIT
gH8QCtHPeO4_9 0 CAITLIN WHY DON'T YOU ROTATE JUST A HAIR TOWARD YES SO ONE SHOULDER IS A LITTLE BIT FRONT
gH8QCtHPeO4_10 0 NOW BRING YOUR HEAD AROUND TO THE FRONT

gH8QCtHPeO4_18 0 TOSS YOUR HAIR BACK A LITTLE
gH8QCtHPeO4_20 0 TILT YOUR HEAD THAT WAY
gH8QCtHPeO4_22 0 LOOK RIGHT IN THE CAMERA
gH8QCtHPeO4_23 0 EXCELLENT NICE BEAUTIFUL
gH8QCtHPeO4_24 0 THAT'S A NICE SHOT RIGHT THERE TOO AND I'LL JUST CONTINUE DOING THIS UNTIL WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW THAT SHE'S GOING TO LIKE

h78Jjm9xHYg_3 0 NOW THE EASIEST WAY TO GET GOLD JEWELRY IS RAID YOUR GRANDMOTHERS JEWELRY BOX OR YOU KNOW YOUR MOMS OR SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT LAYING AROUND THE HOUSE BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE PIECES THAT WE'RE NO LONGER WEARING
h78Jjm9xHYg_4 0 AND THEY HAVE VALUE
h78Jjm9xHYg_5 0 AND BEFORE YOU GO TO SELL IT BY THE WAY CLEAN IT UP
h78Jjm9xHYg_6 0 YOU KNOW IT DOES HAVE MORE VALUE THAT WAY
h78Jjm9xHYg_7 0 YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT TO APPRECIATE IT
h78Jjm9xHYg_8 0 ANOTHER PLACE THAT YOU COULD GET GOLD JEWELRY IS CHECK THE NEWSPAPERS
h78Jjm9xHYg_9 0 PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS SELLING THINGS ESPECIALLY IN THIS ECONOMIC TIME THAT WE'RE LIVING IN
h78Jjm9xHYg_10 0 PEOPLE WANT EXTRA MONEY AND SO THEY'RE SELLING EVERYTHING THEY'RE NOT USING
h78Jjm9xHYg_11 0 SO YOU CAN GET SOME REALLY GOOD DEALS JUST BY CHECKING LOCAL NEWS ADS
h78Jjm9xHYg_12 0 FLYERS YOU CAN GO TO FLEA MARKETS
h78Jjm9xHYg_13 0 PEOPLE ARE SELLING ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING AT A FLEA MARKET
h78Jjm9xHYg_14 0 IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN TO A FLEA MARKET YOU KNOW AND WALK AROUND FROM STALL TO STALL GO ONLINE
h78Jjm9xHYg_15 0 IN ESSENCE YOU'RE HITTING VIRTUAL FLEA MARKETS THEY'RE ALSO KNOWN AS AUCTIONS
h78Jjm9xHYg_16 0 THE ONE THING THAT YOU WANT TO DO WHEN YOU GO ONLINE OF COURSE IS MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE BUYING A GOLD JEWELRY AND THAT IT'S GOING TO BE ACCREDITED
h78Jjm9xHYg_17 0 YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE DOCUMENTATION OF THE KARAT WEIGHT AND DECIDE WHETHER YOU'RE BUYING FOR INVESTMENT OR WHETHER YOU'RE BUYING FOR SOMETHING TO WEAR BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE BUYING FOR SOMETHING TO WEAR YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO CONSIDER SETTING AND THE CUT AND THE CLARITY AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
h78Jjm9xHYg_18 0 IF YOU'RE BUYING JUST FOR AN INVESTMENT YOU'RE SIMPLY GOING TO GO FOR WEIGHT AND THE ONE THING TO REMEMBER THERE IS WHETHER THEY'RE SELLING YOU SCRAP WEIGHT OR WHETHER IT'S JUST THE ACTUAL WEIGHT OF THE PIECE
h78Jjm9xHYg_19 0 SO A COUPLE OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT ENTER IN BUT PRIMARILY THERE IS MANY AVENUES OF FINDING GOLD TO SELL THAT WE OVERLOOK AND YOU GO TO SITES THAT ARE PERHAPS LESSER KNOWN BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT HIT ON AS OFTEN AND SO YOU'RE GOING TO FIND GOOD DEALS
h78Jjm9xHYg_20 0 IT MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE LONGER BUT IT'S WORTH THE SEARCH
h78Jjm9xHYg_21 0 SO THAT'S THE EASIEST WAY OF GETTING GOLD JEWELRY JUST ASK PEOPLE DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING LAYING AROUND BECAUSE I'M IN THE MARKET
h78Jjm9xHYg_22 0 I'M JUDY CARRIER WITH JEWELS BY PARK LANE THAT'S HOW YOU GET GOLD JEWELRY
goBa78OYMg8_1 0 OKAY NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC STEEPING INSTRUCTIONS FOR PUERH TEA
goBa78OYMg8_2 0 AGAIN A PUERH IS A FERMENTED TEA THAT'S IN AGE FOR THIRTY YEARS
goBa78OYMg8_3 0 SO YOU WANT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL WITH THIS TEA BECAUSE IT'S RARE AND EXPENSIVE AND ALSO BECAUSE TOO MUCH CAN BRING OUT SOME OF THE OVERPOWERING MUSTY FLAVORS AND ODORS IN THIS TEA
goBa78OYMg8_4 0 SO DOWN HERE I HAVE MY PUERH AND IF I UNWRAP IT FROM THIS PACKAGE YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S A CONDENSED BRICK TEA
goBa78OYMg8_5 0 AND THE MEASUREMENT FOR THIS IS ONE TABLESPOON
goBa78OYMg8_6 0 IF I PUT MY LITTLE BRICK IN MY TABLESPOON YOU CAN SEE THAT ONE BRICK IS ONE TABLESPOON
goBa78OYMg8_7 0 BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THAT BRICK WILL ACTUALLY MAKE A POT OF TEA
goBa78OYMg8_8 0 NOT A CUP OF TEA
goBa78OYMg8_9 0 SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A CUP JUST PINCH OFF A LITTLE BIT OF THE BRICK
goBa78OYMg8_10 0 BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A WHOLE POT USE A WHOLE TABLESPOON SIZE BRICK
goBa78OYMg8_11 0 AND YOU'RE GOING TO STEEP THIS AT BOILING FOR THREE TO FIVE MINUTES
goBa78OYMg8_12 0 BUT BEFORE YOU STEEP IT YOU'RE GOING TO SOAK IT IN JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BOILING WATER JUST MOISTEN IT WITH SOME WATER
goBa78OYMg8_13 0 AND LET IT SIT FOR THIRTY SECONDS AND THEN FLUSH IT OUT MEANING DISCARD THE WATER THAT YOU SOAKED IT IN FOR THIRTY SECONDS
goBa78OYMg8_14 0 THEN ADD THE BOILING WATER AND STEEP IT FOR THREE TO FIVE MINUTES
g7TS3rqjii0_1 0 HI MY NAME IS DAN SCHMIDT FROM THE CHINESE MARTIAL ARTS CENTER IN SEMINOLE AND TODAY IN THIS CLIP WE ARE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STAFFS
g7TS3rqjii0_2 0 SO MAINLY THERE IS THIS KIND OF STAFF RATTAN
g7TS3rqjii0_3 0 IT IS ALSO KNOWN AS A DOUBLE HEADED STAFF
g7TS3rqjii0_4 0 IT IS CALLED DOUBLE HEADED BECAUSE IT IS OF EQUAL THICKNESS THROUGHOUT THE STAFF ON EACH END
g7TS3rqjii0_5 0 IT IS A VERY FLEXIBLE TYPE OF WOOD AND IT IS VERY STRONG
g7TS3rqjii0_6 0 IT WILL LAST A VERY LONG TIME
g7TS3rqjii0_7 0 DOUBLE HEADED ALSO MEANS THAT YOU DO ONE MOVE WITH ONE END AND THEN IMMEDIATELY YOU WILL DO ANOTHER MOVE WITH THE OTHER END OF THE STICK
g7TS3rqjii0_8 0 SO THIS WAY
g7TS3rqjii0_9 0 THE MOVE WILL GO SIDE TO SIDE UP AND DOWN WITH VARYING TECHNIQUES
g7TS3rqjii0_10 0 SO THIS IS A VERY PLIABLE TYPE OF WOOD
g7TS3rqjii0_11 0 IT HAS TO BE THE SAME WIDTH FROM THE TOP ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM AND THE SIZE OF THE STAFF DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU ARE DOING
g7TS3rqjii0_12 0 MAINLY THE STAFF WOULD BE ABOUT AS TALL AS YOU ARE OR SOMETIMES IT COULD BE A LITTLE BIT TALLER
g7TS3rqjii0_13 0 THERE IS ALSO OTHER KINDS OF STAFFS THE EYEBROW TYPE STAFF WHERE IT GOES UP TO THE EYEBROW HEIGHT OR ANOTHER TYPE OF STAFF COMES UP TO ABOUT THE ARM PIT HEIGHT DEPENDING
g7TS3rqjii0_14 0 MAINLY THEY ARE ALL USED THE SAME BUT THIS IS YOUR MOST BASIC TYPE OF STAFF AND YOUR MOST TRADITIONAL ONE
g7TS3rqjii0_15 0 THEN THERE IS THIS KIND
g7TS3rqjii0_16 0 THIS IS A WHITE WOOD WAX WOOD STAFF AND THIS IS COMMONLY WHAT YOU SEE TODAY
g7TS3rqjii0_17 0 THIS IS USED THROUGHOUT MODERN CHINA
g7TS3rqjii0_18 0 IT IS MADE OF A DIFFERENT KIND OF WOOD AS I MENTIONED WHITE WAX WOOD AND IT IS TAPERED ON ONE END AND IT GETS THICKER TOWARDS THE BOTTOM ON THE OTHER END
g7TS3rqjii0_19 0 THAT IS SO THIS IS A LIGHTER TYPE OF WOOD AND IN THE COMPETITIONS THEY LIKE TO BE VERY VERY FAST SO THIS LOOKS A LITTLE MORE IMPRESSIVE
g7TS3rqjii0_20 0 WHAT THEY DO IS THEY DO THE SAME TYPES OF MOVEMENTS BUT DUE TO THE WEIGHT BEING A LITTLE BIT HEAVIER ON ONE END IT MAKES YOUR FLOWERS AND THE DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES A LOT FASTER AND THOSE ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STAFFS
gTMZUanrOPc_1 0 HI I'M CASEY AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE IN THIS SEGMENT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO USE THE SOOTHING BOOSTER

H98oPirZqKA_2 0 SO NOW WE'RE READY TO GET STARTED WITH TAKING THIS OUT OF THE MOLD
H98oPirZqKA_3 0 THE EASIEST WAY TO START LIFTING AROUND THE SIDE YOU CAN HEAR IT KIND OF SNAP CRACKLE AND POP HERE
H98oPirZqKA_4 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO FLIP IT OVER AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO START PUSHING RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE
H98oPirZqKA_5 0 IT KIND OF FORMS A BUBBLE AND THEN IT COMES OUT

Gl22jqt_ZZM_1 0 ONE OF THE MOST COMMON PROBLEMS WITH BACKPACKING EQUIPMENT IS THAT YOUR THERMAREST OR YOUR INFLATABLE SLEEPING PAD WILL GET A HOLE IN IT
Gl22jqt_ZZM_2 0 SO THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW TO FIX IT BECAUSE YOU WON'T HAVE TO JUST BUY ANOTHER ONE EVERY TIME IT GETS A LITTLE HOLE SO WHAT I DO IS I BLOW IT UP AS MUCH AS I CAN GET AS MUCH AIR OUT OF IT AS I CAN AND TAKE IT AND FILL UP THE BATHTUB AND THEN SUBMERGE THE WHOLE THING IN THE BATHTUB AND THEN START LOOKING AND SEE WHERE THE LITTLE AIR BUBBLES ARE COMING OUT YOU KNOW SO ONCE YOU HAVE FOUND THAT YOU CAN DRY UP THE SPOT AND PUT A SHARPIE X ON IT OR SOMETHING AND YOU MIGHT HAVE A COUPLE HOLES
Gl22jqt_ZZM_3 0 THEN FROM THERE THERE IS A COUPLE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN DO
Gl22jqt_ZZM_4 0 YOU CAN BY THE SPECIALLY MARKED THERMAREST REPAIR PACKAGES
Gl22jqt_ZZM_5 0 I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT YOU NEED TO DO THAT
Gl22jqt_ZZM_6 0 I HAVE HEARD OF PEOPLE REPAIRING IT WITH DUCT TAPE AND IT ACTUALLY LASTED FOR A WHILE LIKE I THINK YOU COULD DO THAT IF YOU WERE ON A TREK AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE A QUICK FIX AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING WITH YOU BUT WHAT I'VE FOUND BEST IS ACTUALLY EPOXY
Gl22jqt_ZZM_7 0 IF YOU GET THAT EPOXY PUDDY THAT YOU BUY AT HOME DEPOT AND YOU MIX IT YOU MIX LIKE THE TWO PARTS TOGETHER AND YOU JUST SMEAR IT ALL OVER THAT HOLE AND IT IS REALLY REALLY STURDY I MEAN I REPAIRED THIS TWO YEARS AGO AND IT HAS CONTINUED TO HOLD SO THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS YOU CAN REPAIR YOUR INFLATABLE SLEEPING PAD BUT MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THOSE HOLES OUT OF THERE
G-nNtwQQxTo_2 0 MY NAME'S JORDAN DAHL
G-nNtwQQxTo_3 0 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ADVANCED FLOOR GYMNASTICS
G-nNtwQQxTo_4 0 AND THE NEXT SKILL I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WAS AN ARABIAN
G-nNtwQQxTo_5 0 THIS IS THE FIRST SKILL WHERE WE'RE KIND OF SWITCHING FROM GOING BACK TUMBLING INTO FRONT TUMBLING
G-nNtwQQxTo_6 0 WHAT IT IS YOU'LL GO ROUND OFF AND FROM THE REBOUND OUT OF YOUR ROUND OFF YOU'LL RIDE IT UP TURN IT AROUND INTO A FRONT TUCK
G-nNtwQQxTo_7 0 NOW THE SET ON THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT
G-nNtwQQxTo_8 0 A LOT OF MY STUDENTS TEND TO GO ROUND OFF JUMP RIGHT FROM THE GROUND AND TURN
G-nNtwQQxTo_9 0 YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE FINISHING YOUR SET BEFORE YOU TURN AND DO THE FRONT TUCK
G-nNtwQQxTo_10 0 SO LET'S WALK THROUGH THIS TECHNIQUE
G-nNtwQQxTo_11 0 YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING ENOUGH POWER OUT OF YOUR RUN AND YOUR ROUND OFF TO GET A NICE SET JUST OUT OF YOUR ROUND OFF
G-nNtwQQxTo_12 0 SO YOU'LL GO ROUND OFF YOU'LL WANT TO GET A STRAIGHT UP SET SO NO ANGLES WITH YOUR FEET ON THIS ONE
G-nNtwQQxTo_14 0 YOU'RE GOING TO RIDE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP AND AS YOU REACH THE CLIMAX YOU'LL PULL AROUND INTO A FRONT TUCK STAY IN THAT TUCK POSITION UNTIL YOU LAND
GzQyQYRbUz8_1 0 HI THIS IS JON ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE
GzQyQYRbUz8_2 0 IN THIS VIDEO CLIP I'LL BE SHOWING YOU THE PROPER MATERIALS TO SAND WITH A BELT SANDER
GzQyQYRbUz8_3 0 SOME OF THE PROPER MATERIALS INCLUDE AN OAK BOARD OR A CHUCK OF PINE
GzQyQYRbUz8_4 0 NOW THESE ARE ACTUAL WOOD
GzQyQYRbUz8_5 0 THEY'RE NOT VENEERS
GzQyQYRbUz8_6 0 THEY'RE NOT PARTICAL BOARD
GzQyQYRbUz8_7 0 THEY'RE ACTUAL SOLID CHUNKS OF WOOD
GzQyQYRbUz8_8 0 THESE MATERIALS ARE OKAY TO SAND ON AS LONG AS THEY DON'T HAVE ANY NAILS IN IT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
GzQyQYRbUz8_9 0 SOME OF THE MATERIALS THAT ARE NOT OKAY TO SAND ON ARE VENEERS AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHY IN JUST A SECOND TREATED LUMBER HAS CHEMICALS IN IT THAT COULD GET INTO THE AIR AND YOU COULD BREATHE THEM AND THEY COULD BE BAD FOR YOU IN ADDITION IF YOU HAVE ANY TYPE OF PAINTED WOOD THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE LEAD PAINT ON THEM
GzQyQYRbUz8_10 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO SAND ON THOSE
GzQyQYRbUz8_11 0 THIS IS A PIECE OF RED OAK VENEER
GzQyQYRbUz8_12 0 VENEER IS JUST A LITTLE TINY THIN PIECE OF WOOD ON TOP OF PLYWOOD
GzQyQYRbUz8_13 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS SAND THE TOP OF IT WITH A BELT SANDER AND SHOW YOU HOW AGGRESSIVE A BELT SANDER CAN BE AND WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO SAND ON A VENEER
GzQyQYRbUz8_14 0 AS YOU CAN SEE WITH JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SANDING I HAVE SANDED RIGHT THROUGH MY VENEER AND SHOWN THAT UGLY PLYWOOD UNDERNEATH
GzQyQYRbUz8_15 0 AGAIN IT IS NOT USUALLY RECOMMENDED TO SAND ON A VENEER WITH A BELT SANDER BECAUSE IT IS SO AGGRESSIVE
h0MW16VRhWM_1 0 THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT LEAVING ROME IS THAT THERE ARE TWO MAIN STATIONS THE STAZIONE TERMINI AND THE TIBURTINA STATION
h0MW16VRhWM_2 0 BOTH LEAVE FOR NAPLES BUT YOU HAVE TO DECIDE HOW TO BOOK YOUR TICKET BEFORE YOU START
h0MW16VRhWM_3 0 JUST CHECK OUT THE TRENITALIA WEBSITE BECAUSE THERE ARE GOING TO BE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM
h0MW16VRhWM_4 0 THE ONLY THING YOU SHOULD AVOID IS LINING UP IN ROME TO PURCHASE YOUR TICKET TO NAPLES
h0MW16VRhWM_5 0 ANYWAY NAPLES IS A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND LARGE CITY ACTUALLY THE LARGEST CITY IN THE SOUTH OF ITALY
h0MW16VRhWM_6 0 SO IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING DESTINATION FOR THE MOST TOURISTS
h0MW16VRhWM_7 0 IF YOU WANT TO GET THERE IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA
h0MW16VRhWM_8 0 THE TRIP WON'T TAKE LONGER THAN FOUR FOUR AND A HALF HOURS SOMETHING LIKE THAT
h0MW16VRhWM_9 0 BUT ON YOUR WAY DON'T FORGET TO TAKE SOMETHING TO READ WITH YOU AND OF COURSE REFRESHMENTS IN CASE THE DINING CAR IS NOT OPEN
h0MW16VRhWM_10 0 THE BEST THING BEFORE GETTING TO NAPLES IS THAT ON YOUR WAY YOU CHECK THE FACILITY OUT IN NAPLES
h0MW16VRhWM_11 0 I'M TALKING ABOUT ACCOMMODATION
h0MW16VRhWM_12 0 I'M TALKING ABOUT THE HOTELS AND HOSTELS AND OF COURSE ALL THE OTHER THINGS WHICH ARE AVAILABLE THERE
h0MW16VRhWM_13 0 IF YOU WANT TO GET TO NAPLES EASY AND FAST THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS TO CHOOSE THE INTER-CITY OR THE INTER-CITY PLUS TRAIN
h0MW16VRhWM_14 0 OF COURSE THERE ARE OTHER FACILITIES FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS AN ESPRESSO TRAIN WHICH LEAVES FROM ROME AS WELL FOR NAPLES
h0MW16VRhWM_15 0 BUT OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT IT MIGHT EXCEED TWO HOURS
GwaZ35fqhUY_1 0 ALL RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO START MAKING OUR MARINADE
GwaZ35fqhUY_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO GET OUR SMALL PLASTIC CUP AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LEMON AND WE'RE GOING TO CUT IT IN HALF
GwaZ35fqhUY_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO SQUEEZE IT OVER THIS STRAINER AND WE'RE DOING THAT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO CATCH THE SEEDS AND SO WE DON'T HAVE TO GO AND PICK THEM OUT LATER AND WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MISSING A SEED AND SOMEONE BITING INTO A SEED WHEN THEY'RE EATING IT
GwaZ35fqhUY_4 0 SO WE'VE GOT THE JUICE OF ONE LEMON
GwaZ35fqhUY_5 0 GOING TO ADD A TABLESPOON OF OIL
GwaZ35fqhUY_6 0 GONNA TAKE HALF OF THE GINGER THAT WE CUT EARLIER DUMP THAT IN AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO ADD A TEASPOON OF SALT AND A TEASPOON OF PEPPER
GwaZ35fqhUY_7 0 SO OUR LAST INGREDIENT HERE IS TARRAGON
GwaZ35fqhUY_8 0 NOW YOU CAN PICK THE LEAVES OFF ONE BY ONE OR YOU CAN GRAB ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE WAY UP AND JUST PULL AND ALL THE LEAVES WILL COME RIGHT OFF
GwaZ35fqhUY_9 0 THAT WON'T WORK AT THE TOP BECAUSE THE STEM IS NOT AS STRONG AND THAT'S WHERE YOU WILL HAVE TO PULL THEM OFF
GwaZ35fqhUY_10 0 AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO BE USING TARRAGON TWICE HERE ONCE AT THE BEGINNING AND THEN ONCE AT THE VERY END
GwaZ35fqhUY_11 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DICE THAT TARRAGON THROW IT IN WITH OUR SAUCE
GwaZ35fqhUY_12 0 WE'RE GOING TO STIR SO ALL OF THE SEASONINGS HAVE MIXED EVENLY
hETiEzBxun0_1 0 WHAT I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT ABOUT THE MEAT AFTER YOU BUY IT
hETiEzBxun0_2 0 YOU CAN KEEP A CUT OF MEAT LIKE THIS IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR PROBABLY UP TO ABOUT FIVE DAYS
hETiEzBxun0_3 0 HERE AT RIB CITY WE DON'T KEEP ANY OF OUR FOOD LONGER THAN FIVE DAYS
hETiEzBxun0_4 0 MOST OF THE TIME IT IS SMOKED AND THEN WE SELL IT WITHIN TWO OR THREE
hETiEzBxun0_5 0 SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ONCE YOU DO BUY IT YOU DATE YOU DATE IT WITH A MARKER IMMEDIATELY SO YOU KNOW HOW LONG THE MEAT'S BEEN IN THE REFRIGERATOR
hETiEzBxun0_6 0 THE OTHER THING I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS OUR DIFFERENT STYLES OF BARBEQUE
hETiEzBxun0_7 0 HERE AT RIB CITY WE'RE A SOUTHERN-STYLE BARBEQUE WE USUALLY DON'T RUB OUR MEAT AT ALL
hETiEzBxun0_8 0 BUT FOR BRISKETS IN ORDER TO GET THE FLAVOR WE RUB WITH A BLEND OF SPICES
hETiEzBxun0_9 0 AND THIS IS JUST A BLEND THAT I'VE PICKED UP IN THE GROCERY STORE
hETiEzBxun0_10 0 WHAT IT DOES IS IT HAS BROWN SUGAR AND THAT'S THE BEST PART OF IT
hETiEzBxun0_11 0 IF YOU DON'T FIND THE RUB WITH BROWN SUGAR THEN YOU CAN JUST ADD IT
hETiEzBxun0_12 0 ALL THIS HAS IS DIFFERENT SEASON SALTS SPICES SOME PARSLEY AND BROWN SUGAR
hETiEzBxun0_13 0 SO THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE
hETiEzBxun0_14 0 I'M GOING TO TAKE THE RUB AND ALL YOU DO IS JUST PUT IT IN YOUR HANDS AND PUT IT SPRINKLE IT RIGHT ON THE MEAT

G4I1sznNUOM_25 0 LET'S START WITH OUR BASIC
GfvWhQ2WoXk_1 0 REMEMBER THAT YOU NEED TO TOUCH YOUR WORK BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE YOU GET A FEEL OF A NICE SMOOTH LINE AND FEEL ANY BUMPS BUT FOR THICKNESS SOMETIMES IT IS HARD TO JUDGE WITH YOUR FINGERS SO I'M GOING TO USE SOME CALIPERS
GfvWhQ2WoXk_2 0 WHAT I'VE GOT HERE IS SOME DOUBLE ENDED CALIPERS
GfvWhQ2WoXk_3 0 NOW THERE IS THIS END HERE AND THIS END
GfvWhQ2WoXk_4 0 IF I OPEN THIS UP 3/4'S THEN THIS OPENS UP 3/4'S AND VISA VERSA
GfvWhQ2WoXk_5 0 THE NICE THING ABOUT THESE CALIPERS IS THAT THIS WILL GO INTO SKINNY LONG VESSELS THIS END WILL AND THIS IS MADE FOR MORE OF OPEN BOWLS
GfvWhQ2WoXk_6 0 SO WE'LL TAKE OUR CALIPERS HERE AND YOU CAN SEE THEM WHILE THEY ARE RIGHT HERE
GfvWhQ2WoXk_7 0 NOW WHERE I READ IT IS GOING TO BE RIGHT HERE AND I CAN SEE THAT THAT WALL THICKNESS IS ABOUT OH A STRONG 1/4
GfvWhQ2WoXk_8 0 I WILL START TO MOVE THAT DOWN NOT REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TOO MUCH HERE AS I AM HERE
GfvWhQ2WoXk_9 0 I WILL MOVE IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND IT HAS GONE JUST A LITTLE NARROWER THAT'S WHAT I WANT
GfvWhQ2WoXk_10 0 NOW IT STARTS TO GO BACK OUT
GfvWhQ2WoXk_11 0 SO IT MEANS I HAVE GOT PLENTY IN THE BOTTOM
GfvWhQ2WoXk_12 0 YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THAT I WANT TO TRY TO GET THAT DOWN HERE AND CLEAR INTO HERE AS BEST I CAN TO GET THAT MEASUREMENT
GfvWhQ2WoXk_13 0 SO IT LOOKS LIKE I CAN TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE OUT OF THE BOTTOM
GfvWhQ2WoXk_14 0 THE SIDE WALL LOOKED REALLY GOOD
GfvWhQ2WoXk_15 0 SO I'M GOING TO SWITCH TOOLS NOW THAT I AM IN THE BOTTOM
GfvWhQ2WoXk_16 0 I AM GOING TO USE MY BIG HEAVY SCRAPER AND CUT FROM HERE ABOUT UP TO HERE AND THE SCRAPER DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB ON FLAT GRAIN BUT WHEN IT COMES OVER TO HERE WHERE YOU HAVE GOT END GRAIN AND SIDE GRAIN IT HAS A TENDENCY TO TEAR

hjJx-iIDrn4_4 0 AGAIN THAT'S THE LOWEST POSITION ON THE NECK THAT WE CAN PLAY THIS CHORD SHAPE IN
hjJx-iIDrn4_5 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO START
hjJx-iIDrn4_6 0 THIS TIME WE ARE GOING TO BE USING THE 6TH STRING THAT'S THAT O IT'S TELLING US TO PLAY IT OPEN OR TO JUST PLUCK THE STRING WITHOUT PRESSING DOWN ON ANY FRETS
hjJx-iIDrn4_7 0 FROM THERE ON THE 5TH STRING WE'RE GOING TO USE OUR SECOND FINGER ON THE 2ND FRET
hjJx-iIDrn4_8 0 ON THE 4TH STRING WE'RE GOING TO USE OUR THIRD FINGER ON THE 2ND FRET
hjJx-iIDrn4_9 0 ON THE 3RD STRING WE'RE GOING TO USE OUR INDEX FINGER HERE IN THE FIRST FRET SO JUST ONE FRET BACK
hjJx-iIDrn4_10 0 AND THEN EASY ENOUGH WE GET THESE TWO WE JUST PLAY THOSE OPEN ALSO
hjJx-iIDrn4_11 0 WE DON'T WANT TO PRESS DOWN ANYTHING
hjJx-iIDrn4_12 0 AGAIN THIS ONE THE ONLY THING TO REALLY BE AWARE OF IS WITH YOUR THIRD FINGER
hjJx-iIDrn4_13 0 MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T ROLL BACK AND HIT THE 3RD STRING
hjJx-iIDrn4_14 0 AND WITH YOUR FIRST FINGER YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN REALLY LEAVE THOSE OPEN AND THAT'S REALLY GOING TO COME FROM USING THE TIPS OF OUR FINGERS PLAYING RIGHT ON THE VERY OUR FINGERTIPS WHEN WE PLAY THAT
hjJx-iIDrn4_15 0 SO WHEN WE LAY IT ALL DOWN YOU CAN AGAIN SEE THAT I'M REALLY ON THE TIPS OF MY FINGERS NOT LETTING THEM TOUCH ANY OF THE STRINGS RIGHT NEXT TO THEM

gPoXGvJB5lg_9 0 CHECK IN THE MIRROR AFTER EVERY STEP
Gfna7SQbvq8_1 0 HI MY NAME'S JORDAN DAHL
Gfna7SQbvq8_2 0 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INTERMEDIATE FLOOR GYMNASTICS AND WE'VE COVERED OUR STRETCHING AND OUR WARM-UPS TO AVOID INJURY AND THE NEXT THING I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WAS WAS YOUR YOUR BODY POSITIONS MAINLY YOUR HEAD POSITION
Gfna7SQbvq8_3 0 YOUR HEAD IS REALLY THE KEY TO WHERE THE REST OF YOUR BODY IS GOING
Gfna7SQbvq8_4 0 WHATEVER YOUR HEAD IS DOING REALLY DETERMINES WHAT THE REST OF YOUR BODY WILL BE DOING
Gfna7SQbvq8_5 0 SO I JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU SOME OF THE BASIC SKILLS AND WHERE YOUR HEAD POSITION IS ON THOSE SKILLS
Gfna7SQbvq8_6 0 THE FIRST IS YOUR HANDSTAND AND WHERE YOU WANT IT TO BE IS YOUR CHIN TUCKED DOWN INTO YOUR CHEST WITH YOUR SHOULDERS UP BY YOUR EARS
Gfna7SQbvq8_7 0 SO YOU'LL KICK UP LOOK AT THE WALL BEHIND YOU COME BACK DOWN
Gfna7SQbvq8_8 0 IT SHOULD STAY IN THAT KIND OF TUCKED POSITION THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH
Gfna7SQbvq8_9 0 SO FOR YOUR HANDSTAND PIROUETTE YOU'LL KICK UP AND AND STAY DOWN IN THAT SAME TUCKED POSITION
Gfna7SQbvq8_10 0 THE SAME THING REALLY GOES FOR YOUR ROUNDOFF AND YOUR CARTWHEEL KEEPING IT IN THAT TUCKED POSITION
Gfna7SQbvq8_11 0 THE ONLY TIME THAT IT REALLY CHANGES IS ON YOUR BACK HANDSPRING AND ON YOUR TUCK
Gfna7SQbvq8_12 0 SO ON YOUR BACK HANDSPRING YOU'RE GOING TO LET IT REACH BACK A LITTLE BIT NOT THROWING IT BACK BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S NOT CORRECT BUT JUST KIND OF LET IT FOLLOW FOLLOW YOUR ARMS BACK SO IT SHOULD LOOK A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS
Gfna7SQbvq8_13 0 AND HERE IT IS FROM THE SIDE
Gfna7SQbvq8_14 0 AND THEN ON YOUR BACK TUCKS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE KEEPING IT LEVEL THAT YOU'RE NOT THROWING IT BACK
Gfna7SQbvq8_15 0 I KNOW IT'S CALLED THE BACK TUCK BUT IN YOUR MIND YOU NEED TO BE THINKING AN UP TUCK SO KEEPING YOUR HEAD LEVEL WATCHING SOMETHING IN FRONT OF YOU TO ENSURE THAT YOU'RE KEEPING YOUR HEAD WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE
Gfna7SQbvq8_16 0 SO IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS
Gfna7SQbvq8_17 0 THERE'S ALMOST A LITTLE BIT OF A DELAY FOR IT
Gfna7SQbvq8_18 0 JUST KIND OF AS A RECAP REMEMBER HOW IMPORTANT YOUR HEAD POSITION IS FOR EVERY SKILL
Gfna7SQbvq8_19 0 IF YOU'RE HAVING A HARD TIME COMPLETING ONE OF YOUR TUMBLING PASSES CORRECTLY REALLY GO BACK AND TRY AND AND FIGURE OUT WHERE YOUR HEAD IS GOING IN YOUR PASS AND YOU CAN WORK ON THAT IN YOUR MIND AND AND AND RETRY IT AGAIN WITH THE PROPER HEAD POSITION
G836MDBhEpg_1 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A BLUE NUT

Gq28u1FEjxc_13 0 I KNOW THERE ARE SIX CYLINDERS AND RIGHT NOW I'M ON MY THIRD CYLINDER
Gq28u1FEjxc_14 0 I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE IT A GOOD SCRIBE ON EACH ONE OF THESE CHAMBERS HERE

GvnA5E6PV-w_1 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A SHANGHAI COCKTAIL
GvnA5E6PV-w_2 0 WE ARE GOING TO START OFF WITH OUR ICE AND POUR THAT INTO YOUR GLASS AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO ADD IN ONE OUNCE OF LIGHT RUM JUST LIKE SO
GvnA5E6PV-w_3 0 WE ARE GOING TO DO ONE TEASPOON OF ANISETTE WHICH HAS A VERY STRONG LICORICE FLAVOR SO IF YOU ARE A LICORICE FAN THIS IS THE DRINK FOR YOU
GvnA5E6PV-w_4 0 THEN A HALF A TEASPOON OF GRENADINE JUST A SPLASH MORE

GvnA5E6PV-w_6 0 WE ARE THEN GOING TO PUT IN THE JUICE OF A QUARTER LEMON WHICH IS GOING TO BE ABOUT A SPLASH LIKE THAT
GvnA5E6PV-w_7 0 IF YOU ARE HAVING A COCKTAIL PARTY INVEST IN A BIG OLD BOTTLE OF LEMON JUICE OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE SQUEEZING LEMONS THE WHOLE PARTY AND YOU CAN'T HANG OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND GET IN TROUBLE

GGaWqNmIYxU_1 0 SO NOW I'VE FINISHED WAXING THE ENTIRE LEAF AND ALL AROUND THE EDGES OF THE LEAF
GGaWqNmIYxU_2 0 AND IN ADDITION TO THAT I'VE WAXED THE BOTTOM OF THE POT
GGaWqNmIYxU_3 0 THIS IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT WHEN GLAZING
GGaWqNmIYxU_4 0 YOU NEVER WANT ANY GLAZE ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR POT
GGaWqNmIYxU_5 0 BECAUSE IT WILL STICK TO YOUR KILN SHELF AND BE FUSED FOREVER
GGaWqNmIYxU_6 0 SO YOU DON'T WANT THAT
GGaWqNmIYxU_7 0 SO THIS IS A BUCKET OF GLAZE
GGaWqNmIYxU_8 0 THIS IS A HOMEMADE GLAZE
GGaWqNmIYxU_9 0 YOU CAN USE COMMERCIAL GLAZE IF YOU LIKE AS WELL
GGaWqNmIYxU_10 0 I'M GOING TO MIX THIS UP REALLY WELL
GGaWqNmIYxU_11 0 IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALWAYS STIR YOUR GLAZE BEFORE YOU USE IT
GGaWqNmIYxU_12 0 BECAUSE SOME OF THE MINERAL PARTICLES ARE HEAVIER THAN OTHERS AND THEY'LL FALL OUT OF THE SUSPENSION AND YOU WON'T GET A TRUE GLAZE RESULT
GGaWqNmIYxU_13 0 NOW I'M GOING TAKE MY TONGS AND I'M JUST GOING TO DIP THIS IN THERE
GGaWqNmIYxU_14 0 AND THE WAX IS GOING TO RESIST THE GLAZE
GGaWqNmIYxU_15 0 BECAUSE THE GLAZE IS WATER BASED
GGaWqNmIYxU_16 0 I'LL WIPE THE BACK OFF
GGaWqNmIYxU_17 0 AND THEN ANY LITTLE DROPS OF GLAZE THAT MIGHT BE LEFT ON YOUR LEAF JUST REMOVE THEM WITH YOUR SPONGE
GGaWqNmIYxU_18 0 AND WHEN THIS FIRES THE WAX WILL ALL BURN AWAY AND YOU'LL BE LEFT WITH THE NATURAL CLAY
GGaWqNmIYxU_19 0 WHICH I USE A BROWN CLAY
GGaWqNmIYxU_20 0 IF YOU HAVE WHITE CLAY YOU'LL HAVE AND EVEN MORE STRIKING RESULT BETWEEN THE VEINS AND THE CLAY ITSELF
h5DJi7F7DiY_1 0 IN THIS EXAMPLE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A A MORE KIND OF LIKE A BUSY STRUM OVER A BASIC BEAT
h5DJi7F7DiY_2 0 SO YOU KNOW LIKE SOMETIMES YOU HEAR A SONGS A FOR EXAMPLE TO GO LIKE THIS
h5DJi7F7DiY_3 0 SO THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DISPLAY FOR YOU RIGHT NOW PLAYING THAT STRUM OVER A BASIC BEAT SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY KIND OF PLAY BUSY ON THE GUITAR STRUM WISE AND YOU KNOW PLAYING OVER A BASIC BEAT SO IT'LL SOUND LIKE A THIS WITH THE DRUM TRACK
h5DJi7F7DiY_4 0 AND SO WHAT I'M DOING THERE IS YOU KNOW OVER JUST A ONE TWO THREE FOUR I'M ACTUALLY PLAYING A LOT MORE STRUMS IN BETWEEN THEN GOING AND THAT KIND OF STRUM SO IT'S DOWN DOWN UP DOWN UP DOWN THAT KIND OF STRUM
h5DJi7F7DiY_5 0 SO AND THEN ADDING ON THE A NOTE AND HAMMERING ON FROM THE FIRST FRET TO THE SECOND ON THE G WITHIN THE CHORD
h5DJi7F7DiY_6 0 AND YOU KNOW BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE GETTING THERE IS A BUSY STRUM PLAYED OVER A BASIC DRUM BEAT
gvKIJCe5zXY_1 0 ALICE MONSAERT THIS EXERCISE IS GOING TO TARGET THE LATISSIMUS DORSI WHICH IS THE LARGE MUSCLE ALONG THE SIDE OF THE BACK
gvKIJCe5zXY_2 0 AND YOU WILL FEEL IT IN THE TRICEPS WHICH IS THE BACK OF THE ARM AND YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO FEEL IT IN THE ABDOMINALS
gvKIJCe5zXY_3 0 THEY'RE GOING TO BE A STABILIZER IN THIS EXERCISE WHICH MEANS THEY'RE GOING TO REALLY CONTRACT TO HOLD THE SPINE IN ALIGNMENT
gvKIJCe5zXY_4 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW VARIOUS LEVELS
gvKIJCe5zXY_5 0 YOU'RE KNEELING HANDS GET PLACED ON THE BALL KIND OF LIKE A KARATE CHOP AND WHEN I PUSH THE BALL OUT BENDING AT THE HIPS AND THEN USING THE ELBOWS TO DRIVE THE BALL IN TO THE SIDE AND BACK UP
gvKIJCe5zXY_6 0 SO I'M USING THIS ACTION WHICH IS TARGETING THE POSTERIOR DELTOID AS WELL AS THE LATS
gvKIJCe5zXY_7 0 SO ONCE I'VE MASTERED THAT AND ONE TECHNIQUE I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT IS PULLING THE ABDOMINALS IN TIGHT RATHER THAN LETTING THE ABS SINK
gvKIJCe5zXY_8 0 SO THE ABDOMINALS ARE IN TIGHT AND I PULL THE ELBOWS TOWARDS THE SIDE
gvKIJCe5zXY_9 0 ONCE I'VE MASTERED THAT I FEEL COMFORTABLE I CAN START TO EXTEND THE BODY FURTHER BY EXTENDING THROUGH THE HIPS AND THAT'S WHEN YOU'LL REALLY FEEL THAT RECTUS ABDOMINUS AND TRANSVERSE ABDOMINUS PULL IN TIGHT
gvKIJCe5zXY_10 0 SO AGAIN YOU'RE PLACING THE BALL IN FRONT OF YOU PUSHING DOWN THROUGH THE HANDS EXTENDING OUT THROUGH THE HIPS AND THEN DRIVING THE ELBOWS INTO THE SIDE
gvKIJCe5zXY_11 0 MAKE SURE YOU'RE NEVER HOLDING YOUR BREATH DURING YOUR EXERCISES AND PULL IN AND AGAIN DEFINITELY GREAT FOR THE ABDOMINALS AS WELL AS THE SIDES OF THE BACK
h7oMSQuvhAg_1 0 JOEL SIEGEL ALL RIGHT
h7oMSQuvhAg_2 0 SO YOU HEARD ME MENTION QUARTER NOTES EARLIER
h7oMSQuvhAg_3 0 MAYBE YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT THOSE ARE
h7oMSQuvhAg_4 0 THE QUARTER NOTE IS BASICALLY JUST THE BEAT
h7oMSQuvhAg_5 0 WHEN YOU HEAR A SONG IT'S THAT NATURAL PULSE THAT YOU FEEL WHATEVER THE TEMPO OF THE SONG IS
h7oMSQuvhAg_6 0 SO THE QUARTER NOTE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENT TEMPOS AND THAT'S WHAT THE QUARTER NOTE IS GOING TO RESPOND TO
h7oMSQuvhAg_7 0 SO CORRESPOND TO EXCUSE ME
h7oMSQuvhAg_8 0 SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE SONG TO THIS TEMPO AND THESE ARE QUARTER NOTES RIGHT HERE
h7oMSQuvhAg_9 0 IF THE SONG IS FASTER THE QUARTER NOTES ARE GOING TO BE HERE
h7oMSQuvhAg_10 0 THIS IS ALSO WHAT THE METRONOME KEEPS
h7oMSQuvhAg_11 0 THESE ARE QUARTER NOTES
h7oMSQuvhAg_12 0 ONE TWO THREE FOUR
h7oMSQuvhAg_13 0 ONE TWO THREE FOUR
h7oMSQuvhAg_14 0 THAT'S HOW WE HEAR AND THAT'S HOW WE COUNT WHEN YOU'RE IN FOUR FOUR TIME
h7oMSQuvhAg_15 0 THE LAST THING I WANT TO JUST TELL YOU ABOUT QUARTER NOTES BEFORE WE PLAY THIS IS SOME MUSICAL NOTATION
h7oMSQuvhAg_16 0 YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN THIS YOU MAY BE YOU MAY NOT BE INTERESTED IN THIS
h7oMSQuvhAg_17 0 NOT EVERYBODY WANTS TO READ MUSIC BUT THIS IS JUST GOOD FOR REFERENCE
h7oMSQuvhAg_18 0 THIS TOP LINE THESE ARE QUARTER NOTES RIGHT HERE
h7oMSQuvhAg_19 0 THIS IS ONE TWO THREE FOUR
h7oMSQuvhAg_20 0 THIS IS WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL QUARTER NOTE LOOKS LIKE
h7oMSQuvhAg_21 0 THIS IS WHAT A QUARTER REST LOOKS LIKE WHICH JUST MEANS YOU'RE NOT PLAYING FOR THAT BEAT
h7oMSQuvhAg_22 0 THIS IS PLAY THIS IS NOT PLAY
h7oMSQuvhAg_24 0 SO LET'S TAKE A LISTEN AND LET'S PLAY SOME QUARTER NOTES

_GROFYNilxI_1 0 HI MY NAME IS LAUREN AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M HERE TO SHOW YOU HOW TO ACHIEVE VARIOUS STYLES THROUGH USING REGULAR BRAIDS
_GROFYNilxI_2 0 BRAIDS CAN ALSO ACCENTUATE YOUR HAIR WHEN YOUR HAIR IS DOWN
_GROFYNilxI_3 0 JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE PUTTING A BRAID IN YOUR HAIR DOESN'T MEAN YOUR HAIR MEAN NECESSARILY HAS TO BE UP
_GROFYNilxI_4 0 WHAT I HAVE LEARNED IS FOR A LITTLE BIT OF VERSATILITY WHILE YOUR HAIR IS DOWN
_GROFYNilxI_5 0 YOU CAN JUST GRAB SMALL STRANDS OF HAIR LITTLE MINI SECTIONS AND CREATE A BIT OF A MORE DRAMATIC LOOK TO YOUR STRAIGHT LONG HAIR
_GROFYNilxI_6 0 YOU CAN TAKE IT JUST DO REAL QUICK BRAIDS YOUR AVERAGE BRAID
_GROFYNilxI_7 0 HONESTLY THESE BRAIDS DO NOT HAVE TO BE PERFECT
_GROFYNilxI_8 0 THEY ARE REALLY TO JUST KIND OF ADD A LITTLE BIT OF NATURAL FLAIR TO YOUR HAIR
_GROFYNilxI_9 0 SO THAT WAY YOU ARE USING YOUR OWN HAIR AND GIVING YOURSELF A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT LOOK SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS JUST STRAIGHT AND DOWN
_GROFYNilxI_10 0 THESE BRAIDS ARE VERY MINUSCULE
_GROFYNilxI_11 0 YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO FINISH THEM ALL THE WAY DOWN IF YOU DON'T WANT TO
_GROFYNilxI_12 0 A GOOD WAY TO SEAL OFF A BRAID LIKE THIS WITHOUT USING A RUBBER BAND IS TO TAKE A BIT OF HAIRSPRAY
_GROFYNilxI_13 0 SPRAY IT DIRECTLY ON IT AND HOLD IT AS THAT HAIRSPRAY DRIES
_GROFYNilxI_14 0 WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS CREATING ALMOST LIKE A SEALANT ON THAT PIECE OF HAIR AND LETTING IT GO
_GROFYNilxI_15 0 YOU CAN KIND OF ADD JUST A LITTLE BIT AROUND THE FACE JUST TO KIND OF GIVE YOURSELF SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FOR A DAY LOOK
_GROFYNilxI_16 0 YOU CAN ALSO DO THIS INSERTING EXTENSIONS THEY HAVE HAIR WHIPS THAT YOU CAN CLIP IN WITH DIFFERENT COLORS YOU CAN ALSO BRAID THEM AS WELL AND CREATE A BIT OF A DIFFERENT LOOK SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE DRAMATIC A LITTLE BIT MORE FUN
_GROFYNilxI_17 0 YOU DO WANT TO MAKE THEM LONG ENOUGH OR AT LEAST THICK ENOUGH SO THAT THEY ARE NOTICEABLE WITHIN YOUR HAIR SO THAT WAY THEY DON'T GET COMPLETELY LOST
_GROFYNilxI_18 0 USUALLY WHEN SOMEBODY DOES A LOOK LIKE THIS THEY ARE ONLY LOOKING TO GET THE FRONT OF THEIR HAIR DONE
_GROFYNilxI_19 0 THEY ARE NOT USUALLY GOING PUT THEM ALL THROUGHOUT BUT YOU CAN IF YOU LIKE TO AND ADD MORE
_GROFYNilxI_20 0 THE MORE YOU PUT IN THE MORE NOTICEABLE THEY WILL BE
_GROFYNilxI_21 0 YOU CAN SEE THAT EVEN THOUGH HER HAIR IS STRAIGHT SHE'S GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A FLAIR IN IT A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW SHE'S GOT THE NICE BRAIDS THAT SORT OF GO THROUGH IT AND IT CHANGES UP HER EVERYDAY LOOK OF JUST WEARING HER HAIR DOWN TO A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN INTRICATE STYLE
gbttQz2Tqsg_1 0 SO HOW ARE DIFFERENT BLACK TEAS GRADED
gbttQz2Tqsg_2 0 THE CHINESE BLACK TEA IS MAINLY GRADED IN LEAF SIZE AND ALSO WHERE WHERE IT'S PRODUCED AND WHAT PART OF THE PICKING WAS MADE WHEN IT WAS PICKED
gbttQz2Tqsg_3 0 AND THE INDIAN BLACK TEAS ARE GRADED BY THEIR LEAF SIZE AS WELL AS THERE'S A STYLE CALLED A CTC IS CUT TEAR AND CURL
gbttQz2Tqsg_4 0 THAT SPECIFIC TYPE OF BLACK TEA IS VERY VERY BROKEN UP AND IT'S SMALL LITTLE PELLETS MAINLY IT'S USED IN TEA BAGS THAT TYPE OF TEA YOU DON'T REALLY SHOULD CARE ABOUT GRADING
gbttQz2Tqsg_5 0 BUT THE ONES THAT YOU SHOULD CARE ABOUT ARE THE FULL LEAF SIZE IT STARTS WITH ORANGE PEKOE OP IT MEANS THAT IT'S A FULL LEAF TEA
gbttQz2Tqsg_6 0 IF SOMEONE'S SELLING YOU AN ORANGE PEKOE TEA IT'S NOT ALL THAT SPECIAL IT JUST MEANS THAT IT'S A FULL LEAF TEA IF THEY ADD OTHER PARTS TO IT SUCH AS A FLOWERY ORANGE PEKOE OR A FINE TIP BEE ORANGE PEKOE IT MEANS IT'S THE TIP OF THE TEA BUD AND IT HAS A BRISKIER FLAVORED TEA BUT IT DOESN'T INDICATE HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS AGAIN IT ONLY TELLS YOU THE LEAF SIZE
gbttQz2Tqsg_7 0 IN CHINA THEY GRADE TEAS IN NUMBERS GRADE ONE GRADE TWO GRADE THREE ONE BEING THE HIGHEST GRADE AND THEY USUALLY STOP ABOUT GRADE SEVEN

GXvSuNCe1Z8_1 0 HI I'M SHERRY AND I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT SAFETY EQUIPMENT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO CONSIDER WHEN PURCHASING A BIKE
GXvSuNCe1Z8_2 0 THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF SAFETY EQUIPMENT YOU WILL EVER BUY WHEN PURCHASING A MOTORCYCLE AND ITS HELMETS
GXvSuNCe1Z8_3 0 WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT STYLES AND MANY DIFFERENT VENDORS BUT ALWAYS CONSIDER YOUR NEEDS WHEN YOU'RE PURCHASING A HELMET PRICE RANGE WHAT KIND OF UNIT YOU'RE BUYING WHETHER THAT BE A CRUISER OR SPORT BIKE THESE CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE

GXvSuNCe1Z8_6 0 THEY'RE MADE OUT OF MANY DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES AND SOME OF THEM ARE SNELL APPROVED AND SOME OF THEM ARE NOT
GXvSuNCe1Z8_7 0 SNELL IS A CRASH TEST RATING THAT THEY WILL HAVE CLEARLY ON THE BACK OF THE HELMET I WOULD ALWAYS LOOK FOR THAT THAT IS A GREAT THING TO LOOK FOR
GXvSuNCe1Z8_8 0 SOME OF THEM DO NOT SOME OF THEM HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS SO ALWAYS CONSIDER WHAT YOU NEED WHEN PURCHASING A HELMET
GXvSuNCe1Z8_9 0 THEY SHOULD FIT SNUGGLY YOU SHOULD FEEL PUNCH ON YOUR CHEEKS THEY SHOULD NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE AND STICK A FINGER IN THE FRONT OF YOUR HELMET THE REST IS JUST PROFILE AND DESIGN AND WHAT IT'S MADE OF AND WEIGHT
GXvSuNCe1Z8_10 0 SO ONCE YOU GET A GOOD FIT IT'S ALL IN WHAT YOU DESIRE

HEA6Yc_xKY4_2 0 SO THAT WE CAN THREAD OUR PIPE AND TUNE IT AND ATTACH IT TO OUR XYLOPHONE BAR SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO USE A VICE GRIP
HEA6Yc_xKY4_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT IN THE PIPE HOLDER SECTION OF THAT VICE GRIP
HEA6Yc_xKY4_4 0 THEN WE'RE GOING TO TIGHTEN IT
HEA6Yc_xKY4_5 0 WE DON'T WANT TO GET TOO CRAZY ABOUT HOW FAR WE TIGHTEN IT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO RUIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE PIPE
HEA6Yc_xKY4_6 0 BUT WE'RE JUST GOING TO GET IT ENOUGH SO THAT IT S GOT A FIRM GRIP AND IT'S NOT GOING TO SLIDE OUT ON US WHEN WE DRILL
HEA6Yc_xKY4_7 0 THEN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A DRILL WHICH IS GOOD FOR DRILLING METAL AND WE'RE GOING TO GO DOWN JUST ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH AND WE'RE GOING TO DRILL OUR HOLE THERE SO THAT THIS STRING ATTACHMENT IS GOING TO BE RIGHT UP TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE PIPE

HEA6Yc_xKY4_11 0 NOW WE HAVE A ROUGH EDGE HERE

gzTdbap9YUk_2 0 I'M DREW FINN AND I'M HERE FOR EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
gzTdbap9YUk_3 0 I'M A PROFESSIONAL HOME INSPECTOR AND I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO INSTALL A CEILING FAN TODAY
gzTdbap9YUk_4 0 NOW THE TOOLS THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED FOR INSTALLING THE CEILING FAN WILL BE A MEASURING DEVICE
gzTdbap9YUk_5 0 I LIKE THE WOOD ONES WE ARE GOING TO USE THAT FOR BALANCE WOBBLE CORRECTION TAPE MEASURE FOR CEILING HEIGHT
gzTdbap9YUk_6 0 WE ARE GOING TO INITIALLY PLAN IT
gzTdbap9YUk_7 0 A POWER SCREW DRIVER THAT S OPTIONAL BECAUSE IT WILL SPEED UP THINGS
gzTdbap9YUk_8 0 A REGULAR PHILLIPS SCREW DRIVER AND A CIRCUIT TESTER TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ELECTRIC POWER
gzTdbap9YUk_9 0 THESE ARE PROBABLY $15 TO $20 EACH
gzTdbap9YUk_10 0 THEY WILL BE WELL WORTH GETTING
gzTdbap9YUk_11 0 SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT POWER IS OFF BEFORE WE DO ANY WIRING
gzTdbap9YUk_12 0 SOME WIRE STRIPPERS TO STRIP THE WIRES BACK SO WE CAN PUT THEM TOGETHER
gzTdbap9YUk_13 0 SO THESE ARE THE COMPONENTS WE NEED
gzTdbap9YUk_14 0 WE COULD GET AWAY WITHOUT THE RIGID TAPE MEASURE WITHOUT THE POWER SCREW DRIVER AND THESE WOULD BE THE MINIMUM TOOLS WE NEED
gzTdbap9YUk_15 0 THOSE WOULD JUST MAKE LIFE A LITTLE EASIER AS YOU WILL SEE AS WE GO THROUGH THE SUN WOOD PROCESS
gzTdbap9YUk_16 0 SO LET'S GET GOING ON PUTTING THIS THING TOGETHER AND THEN WE CAN HANG IT FROM THE FAN AND HAVE A NICE COOL ROOM
GxvUBMfT25M_1 0 CARMEN LYNN HI I'M CARMEN LYNNE WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
GxvUBMfT25M_2 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO BE ANALYZING THIS DREAM THAT LOU HAS TOLD US ABOUT SO I'M GOING TO REFER TO IT AS THE RAILROAD TRACK DREAM
GxvUBMfT25M_3 0 LOU CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT TIME OF THE NIGHT YOU USUALLY HAVE THIS DREAM
GxvUBMfT25M_4 0 LOU WELL I GO TO BED ABOUT BETWEEN TEN AND TWELVE
GxvUBMfT25M_5 0 LET'S SAY I'M TOSSING AND TURNING UNTIL I FINALLY FALL ASLEEP AND I KNOW THAT I'M COMPLETELY OUT AND IT PROBABLY OCCURS AFTER I'M COMPLETELY SLEEPING AND I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING
GxvUBMfT25M_6 0 SO I'M AT THAT STAGE THAT I'M NOT RESTLESS AND IN A DEEP SLEEP
GxvUBMfT25M_7 0 CARMEN LYNN SO WOULD YOU SAY IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
GxvUBMfT25M_8 0 LOU OH YES
GxvUBMfT25M_9 0 CARMEN LYNN MIDDLE OF NIGHT
GxvUBMfT25M_10 0 SO THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IS THE PRECOGNITIVE STAGE ISN'T IT
GxvUBMfT25M_11 0 SO YOU REMEMBER
GxvUBMfT25M_12 0 ALRIGHT SO THAT WAS ONE THING THAT WE'VE DISCOVERED NOW
GxvUBMfT25M_13 0 IT'S IN THE PRECOGNITIVE STAGE
GxvUBMfT25M_14 0 NOW THE SECOND THING I WANT TO ASK YOU IS WHAT IS THE OVERRIDING EMOTION THAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING IN THIS DREAM
GxvUBMfT25M_15 0 LOU I GET SWEATY AND I GET NERVOUS AND I GET SCARED AND BASICALLY IT'S VERY DRAWING TO THE POINT OF NOT KNOWING THE UNKNOWN KIND OF THING THAT SCARES ME AND I JUMP
GxvUBMfT25M_16 0 CARMEN LYNN HOW INTERESTING
GxvUBMfT25M_17 0 SO THE OVERRIDING EMOTION IS ONE OF FEAR
GxvUBMfT25M_18 0 SO WE HAVE FEAR A KIND OF SCARED FEELING
GxvUBMfT25M_19 0 AND THIS IS JUST TO POINT OUT THAT IT IS THE EMOTION THAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING IN THE DREAM WHICH IS MOST SIGNIFICANT
GxvUBMfT25M_20 0 BECAUSE IF LOU WERE TO HAVE A DREAM SUCH AS THIS BUT HE DIDN'T FEEL SCARED IF HE DIDN'T IF HE FELT COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THEN THE DREAM WOULD HAVE A WHOLE DIFFERENT MEANING TO HIM
GxvUBMfT25M_21 0 SO AND TOMORROW WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT SOME OTHER ASPECTS OF THE DREAM AND HOW TO ANALYZE THOSE
G52icoH5-nM_1 0 HI I'M MICHAEL SETO
G52icoH5-nM_2 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO LIGHT A PIECE OF PLEXI-GLASS FROM BELOW TO ACHIEVE A WHITE BACKGROUND FOR A PIECE OF JEWELRY
G52icoH5-nM_3 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS AHEAD OF HAVING THE PLEXI-GLASS FLAT ON THE TABLE I JUST GOT A COUPLE PIECES OF STYROFOAM THAT CAME OUT OF A BOX HOLDING SOME ELECTRONIC GEAR
G52icoH5-nM_4 0 AND I JUST PUT IT RIGHT HERE UNDERNEATH THE PLEXI-GLASS
G52icoH5-nM_5 0 SO THAT'S OFF THE GROUND WE'VE GOT THE JEWELRY ON TOP AS WELL AS THE LIGHTS THAT ARE GOING TO GO ON IT
G52icoH5-nM_6 0 SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO LIGHT THIS UNDERNEATH
G52icoH5-nM_7 0 WE'D NEED TO GET A LIGHT UNDER THERE TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF BACK LIGHTING AND ILLUMINATE THE PLEXI-GLASS
G52icoH5-nM_8 0 SO WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS OUR LIGHT THAT'S GOING TO GO UNDERNEATH
G52icoH5-nM_9 0 NOTICE I CHOSE FLUORESCENT BULBS BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS COOLER AS WELL THE COLOR OF THESE FLUORESCENT BULBS MATCHES THE FLUORESCENT BULBS IN MY OTHER TWO OVERHEAD LAMPS
G52icoH5-nM_10 0 AND THAT'S GOING TO MAKE GETTING THE WHITE BALANCE EASY
G52icoH5-nM_11 0 SO IT'S CRITICAL TO TRY AND BACK LIGHT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET A PURE WHITE BACKGROUND.THE WAY OF DOING THAT I THINK THE BEST WAY OF DOING THAT IS A PIECE OF A CLEAR WHITE PLEXI-GLASS THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW THE LIGHT TO COME THROUGH AND GIVES YOU THAT WHITE BACKGROUND WITHOUT OVER-EXPOSING THE JEWELRY ITSELF
GBlTwqDx5-A_1 0 NEXT UP I'LL BE DISCUSSING THE RAIN STICK
GBlTwqDx5-A_2 0 NOW HERE IS A RAIN STICK
GBlTwqDx5-A_3 0 THEY COME IN VARIOUS SIZES
GBlTwqDx5-A_4 0 NOW THIS IS TRADITIONALLY FOUND IN CHILE IN SOUTH AMERICA WHERE THIS INSTRUMENT IS USED IN CEREMONIES TO ASK FOR RAIN FROM THE GODS ESSENTIALLY WHERE THERE'S A DROUGHT
GBlTwqDx5-A_5 0 THIS INSTRUMENT WILL SIMULATE THE SOUND OF RAIN AND THEREFORE ESSENTIALLY BE A CALL TO THE GODS TO SAY THEY NEED RAIN TO COME
GBlTwqDx5-A_6 0 NOW NOWADAYS IT CAN BE USED AS A MORE CONTEMPORARY INSTRUMENT JUST FOR ITS SOOTHING QUALITIES
GBlTwqDx5-A_7 0 NOW TO PLAY THIS INSTRUMENT I'LL EVEN GET A BIGGER VERSION OF IT HERE JUST SO THAT YOU CAN HEAR A LITTLE BETTER
GBlTwqDx5-A_8 0 SAME INSTRUMENT JUST A BIT LARGER AND THEREFORE A BIT LOUDER
GBlTwqDx5-A_9 0 YOU CAN HEAR THE SOUND IT MAKES KIND OF SIMULATES RAIN
GBlTwqDx5-A_10 0 NOW THE WAY IT WORKS THIS IS A CACTUS A DEAD CACTUS WHERE THE SKIN HAS FALLEN OFF LEAVING JUST THE SHELL WHICH IS CALLED THE NORMADA
GBlTwqDx5-A_11 0 NOW THESE SPIKES OR THE LITTLE TINES THAT ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE CACTUS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF AND HAMMERED INTO THE NORMADA HERE SO THAT THEY STICK INTO THE EMPTY CAVITY INSIDE THE RAIN STICK
GBlTwqDx5-A_12 0 THE ENDS HAVE BEEN CUT OFF AND VERY SMALL STONES HAVE BEEN PLACED IN HERE SO WHEN YOU CAP IT BACK ON AS YOU TILT THE RAIN STICK THE SMALL STONES RUN INTO THE TINES OF THE CACTUS ON THE INSIDE CREATING THE SOUND THAT YOU HEAR
GBlTwqDx5-A_13 0 NOW YOU'LL WANT TO KEEP IT AT ABOUT A SIXTY DEGREE ANGLE AND ROTATE IT TO MAXIMIZE THE SOUND AND GET THE BEST TONE
gd8ghfBL-3o_1 0 WE ARE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO TEACH YOUR DOG TO BRING YOU AN ITEM
gd8ghfBL-3o_2 0 I AM GOING TO START WITH SOMETHING THAT SHE REALLY ENJOYS PLAYING WITH AND I WILL TOSS IT FOR HER TO GO GET IT AND HOPEFULLY SHE WILL GO AND DO THAT AND SHE GETS IT WHICH SHE IS NOT DOING
gd8ghfBL-3o_3 0 AGAIN I MIGHT NEED TO FIND SOMETHING LIKE A BALL OR SOMETHING SHE REALLY ENJOYS AND I WILL WORK WITH TWO SO IF SHE IS WITH THIS TOY AND SHE IS HEADING AWAY FROM ME I AM GOING TO GO TO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WITH YET ANOTHER SQUEAKY TOY
gd8ghfBL-3o_4 0 AS SHE COMES TOWARDS ME IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE MOVING AWAY SO THAT SHE CONTINUES TO FOLLOW YOU RATHER THAN ENDING UP PLAYING CATCH ME IF YOU CAN AND CHASING YOU
gd8ghfBL-3o_5 0 WHEN SHE GETS HERE I WILL GO AHEAD AND SQUEEZE THIS ONE
gd8ghfBL-3o_6 0 SHE SHOULD DROP WHAT SHE HAS IN HER MOUTH TO GET WHAT I HAVE
gd8ghfBL-3o_7 0 YOU CAN AGAIN INCORPORATE TREATS AND THEN YOU ARE GETTING YOUR DOG TO COME AND BRING YOU WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU HAVE THROWN OR THAT SHE MAY HAVE IN HER MOUTH
gd8ghfBL-3o_8 0 SO IT IS A GREAT WAY TO PLAY WITH YOUR DOG AND IT IS A GREAT WAY TO INCORPORATE THE KIDS IN THIS ONCE YOU ACTUALLY GET THEM TO DO IT

gyzGqSVWTyo_17 0 GRABBING AND MAKING SECTIONS EACH TIME
gyzGqSVWTyo_19 0 YOU CAN CROSS AND THEN ADD OR YOU CAN TAKE THIS SECTION ADD AND THEN CROSS
gyzGqSVWTyo_20 0 IT REALLY DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE
-h7TLNxqxBw_1 0 THIS IS OAK WITH PAINTED TEMPLE TATTOO
-h7TLNxqxBw_2 0 TATTOOING IS JUST NOTHING BUT ANOTHER FORM OF ART ON A DIFFERENT CANVAS
-h7TLNxqxBw_3 0 IT'S YOU GOT TO PRE THINK YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING TO GO
-h7TLNxqxBw_4 0 HOW IT'S GOING TO FLOW MUSCLE STRUCTURE
-h7TLNxqxBw_5 0 SO YOU GOT TO INCORPORATE THAT IN YOUR DRAWING ON PAPER
-h7TLNxqxBw_6 0 USUALLY WE TAKE AN OUTLINE OF WHERE WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT ON YOUR BODY AND THEN USE THAT AND THROW SOME GUIDELINES TO MUSCLE MOVEMENT AND THEN WE APPLY THE PAPER SOMETIMES
-h7TLNxqxBw_7 0 IF IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE REAL FAMILIAR WITH DAN AND I WE WILL SIMPLY DRAW IT RIGHT ON YOUR SKIN AND THAT WAY
-h7TLNxqxBw_8 0 WE CAN GET THE ACTUAL FLOW OF THE BODY ITSELF
-h7TLNxqxBw_9 0 THEN GO WITH MUSCLE STRUCTURE
-h7TLNxqxBw_10 0 WE CAN GO WITH YOU KNOW MOVEMENTS OF THE BODY
-h7TLNxqxBw_11 0 ONCE IT'S ON PAPER WE THEN TAKE THEIR BODY PART WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT ON SEE IF IT FITS RIGHT
-h7TLNxqxBw_12 0 IF IT FITS RIGHT THEN WE MAKE A STENCIL OUT OF IT AND WE APPLY IT TO THEM AND SIMPLY TATTOO IT
hJCJNVBKuvs_1 0 NOW WE COULD ALSO USE THE P-ALIGN FEATURE TO JUSTIFY OUR TEXT
hJCJNVBKuvs_2 0 AND TO DO THAT I HAD TO KIND OF BEEF UP OUR PARAGRAPH SO YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE WHAT WE WERE DOING
hJCJNVBKuvs_3 0 BUT IF WE GO IN HERE AND WE COULD DO P-ALIGN AND AS OPPOSED TO OUR LEFT RIGHT OR CENTER WE'LL JUST TYPE JUSTIFY
hJCJNVBKuvs_4 0 AND I WANT TO KEEP DOING THIS
hJCJNVBKuvs_5 0 I'M GOING TO TAKE OFF MY END TAGS
hJCJNVBKuvs_6 0 IF I DO TAKE OF THE END TAGS ON THESE TWO PARAGRAPHS IT WILL JUSTIFY ALL THREE OF THESE PARAGRAPHS TOGETHER
hJCJNVBKuvs_7 0 SO WE'LL SAVE THAT
hJCJNVBKuvs_8 0 COME OVER HERE AND HIT REFRESH
hJCJNVBKuvs_9 0 AND OH IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOT JUSTIFIED
hJCJNVBKuvs_10 0 SO WHAT I WILL DO IS GO AHEAD AND DO P-ALIGN

HjM5F0tiasY_12 0 I SAY IT'S A BUNNY RABBIT HE SAYS IT'S A PENGUIN
HjM5F0tiasY_13 0 HE'S DENYING THE REALITY THAT I'M TRYING TO CREATE
HjM5F0tiasY_14 0 THERE'S A SOFT BLOCK WHICH IS JUST BEING NEGATIVE GRUMPY OR JUST POO POO ABOUT THE OFFER

HjM5F0tiasY_34 0 THERE'S SOME COMEDY THAT COMES OUT OF BLOCKING EACH OTHER
HjM5F0tiasY_35 0 BUT IT'S NOT THE KIND OF COMEDY WE WANT TO GO FOR WHEN WE'RE DOING IMPROV
HjM5F0tiasY_36 0 ONE BECAUSE IT'S NOT VERY NICE IT'S NOT VERY KIND TO YOUR FELLOW PLAYER
HjM5F0tiasY_37 0 YOU'RE KIND OF GETTING A LAUGH AT THEIR EXPENSE AND MAKING THEM LOOK DUMB
HjM5F0tiasY_38 0 AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO PLAY WITH YOU AFTER THAT
HjM5F0tiasY_39 0 AND BEING FUN TO PLAY WITH IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE LEARNING TO DO IMPROV
HjM5F0tiasY_40 0 ANOTHER THING IS THAT IT HAS A SHORT PAYOFF
HjM5F0tiasY_41 0 IT'S FUNNY THEN BUT THERE'S NO WHERE REALLY TO GO AFTER THAT AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP SCENES AND STORIES THAT LAST MINUTES OR EVEN HOURS SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MOVE FORWARD IN OUR SCENES AND OPEN UP POSSIBILITIES INSTEAD OF SHUTTING THEM DOWN
HjM5F0tiasY_42 0 OF COURSE SOMETIMES IN SCENES YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO BLOCK
HjM5F0tiasY_43 0 YOU'RE GOING TO SAY NO TO THE OTHER CHARACTER BUT IT SHOULD BE AN IMPORTANT MOMENT
HjM5F0tiasY_44 0 IT SHOULD BE SAYING NO FOR A REASON
HjM5F0tiasY_45 0 OFTENTIMES WE BLOCK JUST BECAUSE WE'RE FEELING NERVOUS
HjM5F0tiasY_46 0 WE'RE FEELING DEFENSIVE OR WE WANT TO CONTROL WHAT'S GOING ON AND PUT OUR OWN IDEAS OUT THERE
HjM5F0tiasY_47 0 THOSE AREN'T GOOD REASONS TO SAY NO TO OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS
HjM5F0tiasY_48 0 YOU SHOULD ONLY BLOCK OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS WHEN IT REALLY SERVES THE STORY
HjM5F0tiasY_49 0 SO THAT WAS A LITTLE DEMONSTRATION IN WHAT IT MEANS TO BLOCK AND BLOCKING OFFERS CORRIDORS
g_BJceJGwzY_1 0 NOW WE'VE COVERED ZENPONAGE BEFORE AND THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO DO IT FROM MOROTEDORI
g_BJceJGwzY_2 0 A WORD OF CAUTION PLEASE BE GENTLE ON YOUR UKE'S ELBOWS
g_BJceJGwzY_3 0 IF YOU'VE NEVER DONE THIS TECHNIQUE BEFORE YOU CAN DISLOCATE OR HYPER-EXTEND THE ELBOW VERY EASILY

g_BJceJGwzY_15 0 MOVE CORRECTLY AND THEY'LL FOLLOW AS A RESULT
g_BJceJGwzY_16 0 MY FIRST INSTRUCTOR TOLD ME DO NOT ATTEMPT TO THROW I SAID WE'RE DOING AIKIDO HOW CAN YOU NOT THROW
g_BJceJGwzY_17 0 IT TOOK ME AWHILE TO REALIZE THAT THE ATTEMPT TO THROW IS THE PROBLEM
g_BJceJGwzY_18 0 YOU MOVE IN THE CORRECT MANNER AND THEY'LL FALL
gqCq66P3uJI_2 0 YOU THINK I DON'T PRACTICE
gqCq66P3uJI_3 0 LOOK AT THIS BOARD
gqCq66P3uJI_4 0 YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL WHAT'S ON THERE
gqCq66P3uJI_5 0 THAT IS A COMPLETE MESS BUT YEAH LOOK SEE THAT
gqCq66P3uJI_6 0 CURLICUES SQUIGGLY LINES I PRACTICE EVEN AFTER THIRTY YEARS
gqCq66P3uJI_7 0 ANYWAY FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO TEE SHIRTS YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOME KIND OF HARD SURFACE

gqCq66P3uJI_12 0 AND A TEE SHIRT
gqCq66P3uJI_13 0 START OF WITH A WHITE OR A LIGHT GRAY SOMETHING LIGHT BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET INTO THE DARKER COLORS IT'S A LITTLE HARDER IT MAKES IT A LITTLE HARDER AND THERE'S A LOT MORE ADVANCED STEPS TO GO TO TO BE ABLE TO AIRBRUSH ON THOSE COLORS
gqCq66P3uJI_14 0 OKAY THESE ARE THE SUPPLIES I SHOWED YOU RIGHT HERE THE BOARD THE TEE SHIRT AND THE CLOTHES PINS
gqCq66P3uJI_15 0 YOU CAN GET THEM AT THE DOLLAR STORE YOU KNOW DON'T SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS STUFF CAUSE YOU LOSE THEM YOU DROP THEM AND THEY GO AWAY
gNT3-eqZb1o_1 0 WHAT I'M GETTING READY TO SHOW YOU NOW IS A SWIRL BRAID
gNT3-eqZb1o_2 0 IT'S JUST SOMETHING KIND OF FUN AND CREATIVE
gNT3-eqZb1o_3 0 JUST TO THROW ANYWHERE ON THE HEAD THAT YOU WANT TO
gNT3-eqZb1o_4 0 SINCE I HAVE THESE TURNING BRAIDS RIGHT HERE WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO START THE BRAID AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEAD AND BRING IT AROUND JUST TO KIND OF FIT INTO THIS CORNER THAT I'VE CREATED
gNT3-eqZb1o_5 0 JUST AS ALWAYS BEFORE WE START ANY BRAID YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THE HAIR IS GOOD AND MOISTURIZED WITH SOME SORT OF OIL
gNT3-eqZb1o_6 0 EITHER THAT OR THE EGYPTIAN MAGIC IT'S ALL THE SAME
gNT3-eqZb1o_7 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU PICK IT OUT REALLY WELL
gNT3-eqZb1o_8 0 REMEMBER TO HOLD ONTO THE HAIR SO YOU'RE NOT PULLING AT THE ROOT EVERY SINGLE TIME
gNT3-eqZb1o_9 0 JUST GRAB A PIECE OF HAIR AND DO IT LIKE THIS
gNT3-eqZb1o_10 0 REMEMBER WE'RE GOING TO SEPARATE WITH OUR FINGERS SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT EXTREMELY WELL BUT YOU DO WANT TO GET IT BROKEN UP
gNT3-eqZb1o_11 0 THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT WITH IT AS YOU TRYING TO MOVE ALONG THE HEAD
gNT3-eqZb1o_12 0 JUST PICK IT OUT SO WE CAN GET READY TO PART IT AND START OUR BRAID
h52yhtVXwro_1 0 THE KEY ELEMENT IS FINDING YOUR ARTIST
h52yhtVXwro_2 0 YOU AND YOUR ARTIST SHOULD HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WHERE HE DOES AWESOME WORK AND YOU GET AWESOME WORK
h52yhtVXwro_3 0 YOU SHOULD ALLOW YOUR ARTIST AS MUCH FREEDOM AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO LAY OUT AS A QUARTER SLEEVE OR A HALF SLEEVE OR A FULL SLEEVE BECAUSE HE HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE DOING THAT
h52yhtVXwro_4 0 I'VE FOUND WITH TATTOO CLIENTS EVEN VERY HEAVILY TATTOOED CLIENTS THAT GENERALLY SPEAKING THEIR IDEAS AREN'T VERY GOOD
h52yhtVXwro_5 0 IT'S LIKE ME GOING TO A PLUMBER AND TELLING HIM WHAT I THINK HE SHOULD DO TO MAKE ALL THE PIPES WORK
h52yhtVXwro_6 0 WHEN REALLY I JUST WANT THE PIPES TO BE AWESOME
h52yhtVXwro_7 0 WHEN YOU PAY SOMEBODY AND THAT'S THEIR VOCATION THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND WHAT THEY DO CHANCES ARE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH AN INCREDIBLE SET OF ART THAT YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED
h52yhtVXwro_8 0 IT'S GOOD TO GIVE GUIDELINES THOUGH OR IDEAS
h52yhtVXwro_9 0 NOT LIKE HEY I WANT THIS WITH THIS AROUND IT WITH THESE INITIALS IN IT BECAUSE THEN THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET AND IT'S GOING TO BE CRAP BUT IF YOU'RE LIKE WELL I REALLY WANT TO REPRESENT TEMPTATION OR SOME KIND OF IDEA OR SOME KIND OF FEELING OR MOOD OR TONE OR EXPERIENCE
h52yhtVXwro_10 0 THEN I WOULD RELAY THAT TO MY ARTIST AND SAY HEY I WANT TO GET SOMETHING THAT REPRESENTS THE FACT THAT I JUST HAD A CHILD
h52yhtVXwro_11 0 NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU NEED TO GET A PICTURE OF THE BABY ALL BUSTED WITH FUNNY HAIR AND NO TEETH AND STUFF
h52yhtVXwro_12 0 THERE'S A MILLION WAYS TO REPRESENT PARENTING AND REPRODUCTION AND LOVE AND ETERNAL BLISS AND LIKE ALL THIS CRAP RESPONSIBILITY
h52yhtVXwro_13 0 LIKE IF YOU JUST THINK ABOUT THE CONCEPT AND GIVE YOUR ARTIST THOSE THEN HE CAN TAKE THOSE AND CREATE SOMETHING INCREDIBLE WITH IT
H-Dz0oWY-O0_1 0 SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT PUNK JEWELERY
H-Dz0oWY-O0_2 0 NOW THE BIGGEST MOST POPULAR THING IN PUNK JEWELERY IS HEAVY SILVER AND BLACK JEWELERY
H-Dz0oWY-O0_3 0 HERE I'VE GOT A BRACELET THAT HAS SPIKES ON IT WHICH IS ANOTHER BIG JEWELERY TREND
H-Dz0oWY-O0_4 0 YOU CAN ALSO SEE IT'S A BLACK LEATHER CUFF AND SILVER JEWELERY
H-Dz0oWY-O0_5 0 YOU DON'T REALLY SEE GOLD JEWELERY OR REALLY ANY STONES
H-Dz0oWY-O0_6 0 IT'S ALL SILVER AND BLACK TO SORT OF GO WITH THE METAL AND HARDWARE OF SOME OTHER THINGS
H-Dz0oWY-O0_7 0 YOU MIGHT SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS THROUGH SOMEONE'S EAR OR YOU MIGHT SEE A GAGED HOLE WHICH IS WHERE YOU TAKE A NORMAL HOLE YOU CAN SEE THE SIZE OF MINE AND YOU SLOWLY PUT IN LARGER AND LARGER EARRINGS UNTIL THE HOLE MIGHT BE LIKE AN INCH ACROSS
H-Dz0oWY-O0_8 0 IN ADDITION PIERCINGS ARE INCREDIBLY POPULAR IN PUNK FASHION AS IS THE USE OF EVERYDAY OBJECTS AS JEWELERY
H-Dz0oWY-O0_9 0 WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT LATER WITH CLOTHING HOW EVERYDAY OBJECTS CAN BE USED AS PIECES CLOTHING BUT FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SEE THAT RATHER THAN USE THE BUTTONS ON THIS SHIRT I'VE SAFETY PINNED IT TOGETHER
H-Dz0oWY-O0_10 0 THE USE OF THE SAFETY PIN IS PROBABLY ANOTHER SORT OF SYMBOL OF PUNK BUT THE IDEA THAT A SAFETY PIN MIGHT BE THROUGH SOMEONE'S EAR OR THROUGH A PIERCING OR THERE MIGHT BE A NECKLACE OF SAFETY PINS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
H-Dz0oWY-O0_11 0 USING AN EVERYDAY OBJECT AND MAKING IT JEWELERY WAS ANOTHER WAY THAT THE PUNKS SORT OF WERE ANTI-CONSUMER AS THEY MADE FUN OF THE IDEA OF SPENDING ON THINGS LIKE JEWELERY
glkgvFU0Tv4_1 0 NEXT LET'S ADD SOME HORSE LEGS TO OUR COMBINATION JUST AT THE VERY END
glkgvFU0Tv4_2 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS JUST CIRCLE OUR LEGS IN THE HIP SOCKETS LIKE WE'VE TALKED SO FREQUENTLY ABOUT JUST KEEP THEM LOOSE
glkgvFU0Tv4_3 0 AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO GO ONE TWO THREE AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DO A CROWN SO WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT HIP HOP OUT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT AND CROWN RIGHT LEFT RIGHT CROWN
glkgvFU0Tv4_4 0 AND AGAIN THE HIGHER YOU CAN GET YOUR LEGS IN THOSE HIP SOCKETS THE MORE AESTHETICALLY PLEASING IT WILL BE
glkgvFU0Tv4_5 0 SO LETS TRY IT WITH THE ARMS
glkgvFU0Tv4_6 0 WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE CIRCLING OUR ARMS JUST LIKE THIS BACK AND FORTH KIND OF LIKE ROWING A BOAT
glkgvFU0Tv4_7 0 SO RIGHT LEFT RIGHT AND CROWN ONE TWO THREE AND FOUR ONE TWO THREE AND FOUR
glkgvFU0Tv4_8 0 AND THAT'S OUR LAST MOVE AND THEN WE'LL PUT IT ALL TOGETHER
_hGcG_feajk_1 0 OK NOW THAT WE'VE SORT OF GOTTEN OH AT LEAST THE VERY BASICS OF WALKING OUT OF THE WAY LET'S WORK ON THE VERY BASICS OF STANDING
_hGcG_feajk_3 0 PRETTY FLAT-FOOTED I'VE GOT BIG BOXY FEET EVERYTHING TOUCHES THE GROUND
_hGcG_feajk_4 0 NOW BUT IF YOU CAN TRY TO LOOSEN UP AS TO HOW YOU'RE STANDING
_hGcG_feajk_5 0 NOW WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
_hGcG_feajk_6 0 IT MEANS THERE'S A SLIGHT BEND IN THE KNEE
_hGcG_feajk_7 0 THE THIGHS ARE TAKING THE MAJORITY OF THE WEIGHT AND THE MUSCULATURE IS HOLDING YOU UP
_hGcG_feajk_8 0 I COULD PROBABLY SLIDE A SMALL PIECE OF PAPER UNDERNEATH MY HEELS RIGHT NOW EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE MY WEIGHT IS BACK
_hGcG_feajk_9 0 AGAIN THIS IS ANOTHER FORWARD PROJECTION
_hGcG_feajk_10 0 THIS IS AN AGGRESSIVE MOTION WITHOUT SHOWING ANY FORM OF AGGRESSION
_hGcG_feajk_11 0 AND IT'S VERY BALANCED VERY SPRINGY LIGHT ON THE FEET
_hGcG_feajk_12 0 REMEMBER WE HAD THE ATHLETIC CROUCH BEFORE AND I MEAN FROM THE SIDE THERE ISN'T A LOT OF DIFFERENCE EXCEPT THAT WE STAND UP WE BRING OUR HIPS PELVIS UNDERNEATH OF US
_hGcG_feajk_13 0 SUCK THE PELVIS UNDER SUCK THE RIB CAGE UNDER STAND UP STRAIGHT
G5IZwTmAXvg_1 0 YOU KNOW CONSUMER FIREWORKS CAN ADD A GREAT DEAL OF FUN TO ANY GATHERING PARTY OR HOLIDAY EVENT
G5IZwTmAXvg_2 0 HI I'M CAPTAIN JOE BRUNI WITH OVER THREE DECADES OF FIREFIGHTING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE MEDICAL EXPERIENCE
G5IZwTmAXvg_3 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT ARE FIREWORKS INJURIES RELATED TO THE CONSUMER TYPE OF FIREWORK
G5IZwTmAXvg_4 0 SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS THE COMMON SPARKLER TO THE FOUNTAIN TYPE OF FIREWORK CAUSES MANY INJURIES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR
G5IZwTmAXvg_5 0 THERE'S APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE INJURED EVERY YEAR FROM FIREWORKS USE AND APPROXIMATED FIFTY THOUSAND FIRES CAUSED BY THESE DEVICES
G5IZwTmAXvg_6 0 SOME OF THE INJURIES INCLUDE HAND INJURIES AND FINGER INJURIES EYE INJURIES AND BURN INJURIES
G5IZwTmAXvg_7 0 TO STAY SAFE AND AVOID THESE TYPES OF INJURIES A SAFETY PERSON SHOULD BE DESIGNATED TO SEE THE OVER ALL BACKYARD DISPLAY AS WELL AS AN IGNITION OFFICER ASSIGNED AS THE SHOOTER TO IGNITE THESE FIREWORKS
G5IZwTmAXvg_8 0 CHILDREN SHOULD BE UNDER THE CLOSE SUPERVISION OF A RESPONSIBLE ADULT TO AVOID ANY TYPE OF INJURY FROM THESE FIREWORKS
G5IZwTmAXvg_9 0 BELIEVE IT OR NOT IT IS BYSTANDERS AT EVERY EVENT WHO ARE INJURED THE MOST
G5IZwTmAXvg_10 0 I'M CAPTAIN JOE BRUNI STAY SAFE AND WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME
GanQ2mq1LwE_1 0 HI I'M KAREN FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
GanQ2mq1LwE_2 0 NOW TAKE THE TWO SIDES AND FOLLOW FOLLOW ALONG WITH BOTH OF THEM UNTIL YOU GET TO THE NEXT POCKET
GanQ2mq1LwE_3 0 YOU CAN JUST KIND OF WIGGLE IT AROUND UNTIL YOU FIND BOTH POCKETS AND YOU PUT YOUR HAND INSIDE THE NEXT SET OF POCKETS
GanQ2mq1LwE_4 0 OKAY AT THIS POINT IT IS GOOD TO DO A LOT OF FLUFFING LIKE THIS TO DROP TO STRAIGHTEN OUT SOME OF THE MATERIAL
GanQ2mq1LwE_5 0 NOW YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS IN BOTH CORNERS OF THE SHORT END WE ARE GOING TO PUT OUR HANDS TOGETHER AND FLIP OVER AGAIN FOLDING ONE CORNER ON TOP OF THE OTHER CORNER
GanQ2mq1LwE_6 0 AGAIN SHAKE IT DOWN TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THE MATERIAL HERE AND NOW WE WOULD LAY THAT ON OUR TABLE AND BEGIN THE FOLDING
GanQ2mq1LwE_7 0 OKAY THIS IS HOW YOU LAY IT ON THE TABLE THE TEMPLATE IS AT THE END OF THE TABLE SO WE CAN JUDGE HOW BIG WE NEED TO FOLD IT
GanQ2mq1LwE_8 0 NOW THIS IS A VERY DEEP POCKETED SHEET AND WE WOULD FOLD THAT DEEP POCKET IN FULL LENGTH IN
GanQ2mq1LwE_9 0 HOLD THAT GRASP THE CORNER AND THE END AND PULL THAT NICE AND STRAIGHT NOW THIS HAS A VERY STRETCHY RUFFLE SIDE YOU CAN JUST FOLD THAT DOWN LIKE THAT AND THEN AGAIN WE WANT TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THE TOP HERE AND JUST PULL IT AS STRAIGHT AS POSSIBLE
GanQ2mq1LwE_10 0 GET THAT GATHER MATERIAL TO BE STRAIGHT ACROSS AND THEN ON THE CORNER YOU ARE JUST GOING TO TUCK AND FOLD TO MAKE IT AS FLAT AS POSSIBLE
gMl0CV6QweM_1 0 HI MY NAME IS MICHAEL LEWIS FROM CHRISTIAN MARTIAL ARTS
gMl0CV6QweM_2 0 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO SPIN AROUND A BO STAFF
gMl0CV6QweM_3 0 THERE'S MANY MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO SPIN A BO STAFF AROUND SO YOU CAN'T REALLY HOLD YOURSELF TO ONE
gMl0CV6QweM_4 0 THE BEST THING TO DO IS GO OUT INTO YOUR BACKYARD JUST START EXPERIMENTING AROUND WITH THIS AND SEE WHAT REALLY WORKS FOR YOU
gMl0CV6QweM_5 0 TO START OUT WITH A FEW BASICS OBVIOUSLY JUST SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY NOT PRACTICAL BUT IT JUST LOOKS COOL
gMl0CV6QweM_6 0 YOU CAN ADD IT IN TO YOUR FORMS OR INTO YOUR COTTAS OR ANYTHING THAT YOU MAKE UP IS JUST TO TAKE THE BO STAFF SPIN IT AROUND AND TAKE ONE HAND OFF CATCH IT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND JUST CONTINUE TO FLIP LEFT OR RIGHT HAND WHICHEVER YOU START OUT WITH
gMl0CV6QweM_7 0 I'M STARTING WITH MY LEFT HAND HERE AND JUST FLIPPING IT AROUND
gMl0CV6QweM_8 0 JUST MAKE SURE YOU KEEP IT NEAR THE CENTER
gMl0CV6QweM_9 0 IF YOU GET OFF AND YOU START SLIDING DOWN WHICH IS VERY EASY YOUR WEIGHT IS GOING TO BE UNEVENLY DISTRIBUTED AND YOU COULD POSSIBLY LOSE YOUR BO STAFF
gMl0CV6QweM_10 0 ANOTHER WAY ADDING IN STRIKES INTO SPINNING YOUR BO STAFF IS TO TAKE HAVE THE LEFT HAND PALM DOWN THE RIGHT HAND PALM UP
gMl0CV6QweM_11 0 WHAT I DO IS I TAKE IT I SPIN IT AROUND TO WHERE MY ARMS ARE CROSSED BUT THEN I LAY IT UP AGAINST MY BODY TO THE SIDE AND THAT'S ACTUALLY A STRIKE IN OF ITSELF BUT THEN YOU CAN TURN THAT INTO A SPIN BY TAKING IT UNCROSSING YOUR ARMS CHANGING YOUR HANDS POSITIONS SO NOW YOUR RIGHT HAND IS PALM DOWN LEFT HAND PALM UP
gMl0CV6QweM_12 0 SPIN IT TO CROSS YOUR ARMS AND LAY IT DOWN SO IF YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER YOU JUST GO BACK AND FORTH JUST LIKE THAT
gMl0CV6QweM_13 0 IF YOU WANT TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INTRICATE WITH THAT YOU'D BEGIN TO SCOOP
gMl0CV6QweM_14 0 YOU TAKE YOUR HANDS SAME POSITION RIGHT HAND PALM UP LEFT HAND PALM DOWN
gMl0CV6QweM_15 0 CROSS IT AROUND AND LAY IT UP AGAINST YOUR BODY AND WHAT YOU DO IS YOU SCOOP DOWN CHANGE YOUR HANDS AND NOW YOU SCOOP DOWN TO THE OTHER SIDE AND IT'S ACTUALLY A CONTINUOUS SPINNING OF THE BO STAFF
gMl0CV6QweM_16 0 YOU JUST HAVE TO LEARN TO CHANGE YOUR HANDS AT THE RIGHT TIME AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE STAYING IN THE CENTER OF THE BO STAFF SO THOSE ARE JUST TWO OR THREE BASIC WAYS TO BE ABLE TO SPIN YOUR BO STAFF AROUND AND GET STARTED
gMl0CV6QweM_17 0 AGAIN EXPERIMENT WITH IT
gMl0CV6QweM_18 0 GO OUT INTO YOUR BACKYARD AND GIVE IT A TRY
hd7AD_RfIec_1 0 ALL RIGHT NOW THIS IS OUR OTHER SCENARIO
hd7AD_RfIec_2 0 WE DETERMINED THAT THE WATER LEVEL MAYBE HAD COME UP TOO HIGH AND WAS RUNNING TO THE TOP OF THE OVERFLOW TUBE
hd7AD_RfIec_3 0 SO THAT TELLS US THAT THE BALLCOCK EITHER NEEDS A NEW WASHER AND NEEDS TO BE REBUILT OR WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT
hd7AD_RfIec_4 0 WELL FIRST WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THIS ONE
hd7AD_RfIec_5 0 SO WE'VE ALREADY SHUT THE WATER OFF AND WE'RE GOING TO GO UNDERNEATH AND DISCONNECT THE SUPPLY LINE FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE BALLCOCK
hd7AD_RfIec_6 0 IN THIS CASE IT'S ONE OF THE BRAIDED ONES IT'S VERY EASY TO UNDO
hd7AD_RfIec_7 0 WE GET THAT LINE OFF THEN DO THE HOLD DOWN NUT THAT HOLDS THE BALLCOCK TO THE TANK
hd7AD_RfIec_8 0 THIS IS THE IMPORTANT NUT BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT KEEPS THE TANK FROM DRIPPING ON THE FLOOR VIS-A-VIS THE SEAL RIGHT THERE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BALLCOCK
hd7AD_RfIec_9 0 SO WE TAKE THE OLD ONE OUT
hd7AD_RfIec_10 0 THIS IS A CORKY
hd7AD_RfIec_11 0 THIS IS A VERY NICE BALLCOCK HERE
hd7AD_RfIec_12 0 SO WE TAKE THIS BALLCOCK BUT WHAT I REALLY LIKE IS THE MANSFIELD BALLCOCK
hd7AD_RfIec_13 0 THIS UNIT IS ALL BRASS
hd7AD_RfIec_14 0 IT FILLS VERY QUICKLY AND IT IS THE QUIETEST OF ALL THE BALLCOCKS THAT YOU CAN OWN
hd7AD_RfIec_15 0 SO IF YOU HAVE A TOILET NEXT TO A BEDROOM OR AN AREA THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ENJOY THE QUIETNESS AND OR THE QUICK FILLING TIME YOU GO FIND YOURSELF A MANSFIELD 07A BALLCOCK
hd7AD_RfIec_16 0 YOU DROP IT INTO THE TANK YOU CENTER IT PUT DOWN THE NUT TIGHTEN HER DOWN
hd7AD_RfIec_17 0 I CAN SEE ALREADY THAT WE HAVE TOO LONG OF A FLOAT ROD BUT THAT'S NO PROBLEM
hd7AD_RfIec_18 0 WE'RE IN A HARDWARE STORE WE'RE GOING TO GO REPLACE IT WITH A SHORTER ONE
hd7AD_RfIec_19 0 WE'LL GET THIS ANCHORED DOWN
hd7AD_RfIec_20 0 THIS JOB USUALLY REQUIRES A PAIR OF CHANNEL LOCKS
hd7AD_RfIec_21 0 A PAIR OF 440'S OR SOMETHING MEDIUM SIZE IS PRETTY NICE
hd7AD_RfIec_22 0 I'M GOING TO GO UNDERNEATH AND WE'RE GOING TO TIGHTEN IT TO THE TANK AND IT'S SECURE
hd7AD_RfIec_23 0 I'M GOING TO TAKE AND I'M GOING TO PUT THE SUPPLY LINE BACK ON IT AND THEN WE'LL HAVE THIS ALL SET TO GO
gGpIriUEVOw_1 0 THE NEXT THING YOU ARE GOING TO DO IS ACTUALLY MASSAGE THE ELBOW ITSELF ACTUALLY PUTTING PRESSURE ALL THE WAY AROUND NICE CIRCULAR MOTION WITH YOUR FINGERS ABOVE AND BELOW THE JOINT FRONT AND BACK ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH AND ALONG THE FRONT OF THE LEG
gGpIriUEVOw_2 0 THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MAY ALSO BE A PROBLEM
gGpIriUEVOw_3 0 A DOG WITH ELBOW DYSPLASIA DOESN'T LIKE THIS MASSAGE TO START WITH IN WHICH CASE YOU WANT WITH JUST SOME SOFT GENTLE MOVEMENT JUST MOVE YOUR HANDS OVER THE SKIN DON'T PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON IT AND GRADUALLY WORK YOUR WAY UP
gGpIriUEVOw_4 0 IF YOU FEEL HEAT IN THE JOINT YOU MAY ALSO FIND THE THE DOG MAY OBJECT A BIT AND ALSO IN THIS CASE DON'T DO AS MUCH OF IT JUST DO A MINUTE OR TWO SEE WHAT HE'LL TOLERATE AND THEN TRY AGAIN THE NEXT TIME YOU ARE DOING A SESSION AND GRADUALLY WORK YOUR WAY UP AND YOU'LL FIND THAT THIS WILL GET EASIER AS YOU WORK WITH THE ANIMAL AND THE GENERAL ENERGY IS FLOWING SOME OF THE STIFFNESS IS RELIEVED THEN THEY ARE GOING TO BE MORE LIKELY TO TOLERATE THIS PARTICULAR AREA BEING MASSAGED
hIubyjPBr4A_1 0 OK THE NEXT STEP THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS ACTUALLY START ATTACHING SOME OF THIS STUFF TOGETHER BEFORE WE'RE ABLE TO HANG IT UP
hIubyjPBr4A_2 0 I ALWAYS LIKE TO RECYCLE EVERYTHING THAT I POSSIBLY CAN SO I'LL TAKE THE ENDS OF FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS THAT I DON'T USE AND CUT OFF AND USE THOSE FOR TOOLS
hIubyjPBr4A_3 0 ONE WAY TO ANCHOR THIS PIECE INTO THIS PIECE IS TO TAKE AND LITERALLY DRIVE A PEG DOWN INTO IT USING THE ENDS OF THE STEMS AND HITTING IT WITH SOME HOT GLUE GUN SO THAT IT WILL STAY
hIubyjPBr4A_4 0 AND THEN YOU COULD TAKE AND JUST PUSH IT ON DOWN AND ATTACH IT
hIubyjPBr4A_5 0 PLACE IT WHERE YOU WOULD LIKE IT TO BE
hIubyjPBr4A_6 0 THE NEXT THING IS TRYING TO ATTACH THE HELICONIA IT'S A VERY HEAVY FLOWER
hIubyjPBr4A_7 0 TAKING THAT SAME WIRE WHAT I'VE DONE IS CUT IT IN PIECES AND BEND IT AROUND SO THAT YOU HAVE A U CLAMP AND I TRY TO ATTACH IT WHERE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SEEN BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE'VE COVERED THIS WITH THE SILK FLOWERS I NEED TO PUT A HOLE IN THE FLOWERS WITH AN EXACTO KNIFE TO GET IT DOWN IN THERE
hIubyjPBr4A_8 0 AND AGAIN YOU CAN HIT IT WITH A HOT GLUE GUN TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO STAY
hIubyjPBr4A_9 0 THE OTHER THING THAT WILL HELP YOU IS ON THIS PIECE THAT'S GOING ACROSS I'M GOING TO HAVE THE BAMBOO GOING DOWN INTO IT SO AGAIN USING A KNIFE EXACTO KNIFE CUTTING RIGHT INTO THE HOLE CUTTING AN X INTO THE LEAF ON BOTH SIDES SO THAT WHEN YOU PUSH THIS DOWN THROUGH MISSED THE HOLE
hIubyjPBr4A_10 0 OK IT'S ATTACHED TO THIS AND THEN WE COULD DO THE SAME THING BY ATTACHING THIS WITH A PIN FROM THIS ONE TO THIS PIECE SO THEN YOU'RE STARTING TO ATTACH A PIECE SO THAT YOU CAN HANG IT
hIubyjPBr4A_11 0 SO THE NEXT THING YOU NEED TO DO IS START ATTACHING YOUR PIECES TOGETHER ON A HORIZONTAL SURFACE THAT'LL BE HEAVIER CONSTRUCTION SO THAT IT'S EASIER THAN TRYING TO DO IT WHILE IT'S HANGING ON A VERTICAL
hIubyjPBr4A_12 0 SO ATTACH ALL YOUR PIECES BEFORE YOU HANG IT UP ON THE VERTICAL
gmlvsCma0hw_1 0 CALEB LABARDA NOW IN THIS PART WE'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO DO OUR SPIN OKAY
gmlvsCma0hw_2 0 OUR SPIN IS VERY IMPORTANT
gmlvsCma0hw_3 0 YOU GOTTA BE ABLE TO LEARN KNOW HOW TO SPIN AND GET A LOT OF SPEED AND MOMENTUM BUILT UP AND THEN KNOW HOW TO LAND ON YOUR FEET AT THE SAME TIME
gmlvsCma0hw_4 0 OKAY SO NOW WHEN YOU WANT TO SPIN WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO USE SOME SCIENCE HERE
gmlvsCma0hw_5 0 WHEN YOU SPIN IN A CIRCLE IF YOU NOTICE YOU JUST SPIN LIKE THIS
gmlvsCma0hw_6 0 YOU DON'T PICK UP VERY MUCH POWER
gmlvsCma0hw_7 0 NOW TRY PUTTING YOUR ARMS OUT OKAY
gmlvsCma0hw_8 0 NOW YOU'RE STILL YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH POWER
gmlvsCma0hw_9 0 NOW START SPINNING AND THEN PULL YOUR ARMS IN TIGHT AND YOU'LL NOTICE YOU'RE GOING TO GO AROUND REALLY FAST OKAY
gmlvsCma0hw_10 0 FASTER AND FASTER
gmlvsCma0hw_11 0 SO WHEN YOU DO YOUR JUMP SPIN 720 YOU'RE GOING TO JUMP AND PULL YOUR GUARDS IN SO YOU'RE DOING A NICE TIGHT SPIN AND THEN AT THE LAST SECOND YOU'RE GOING TO THROW OUT YOUR LEG TO DO YOUR KICK OKAY
gmlvsCma0hw_12 0 SO SPINNING IS REALLY IMPORTANT
gmlvsCma0hw_13 0 SO WHEN YOU JUMP GO AND PRACTICE SOME JUMPS AND YOU GOTTA BE ABLE TO DO TWO SPINS IN THE AIR
gmlvsCma0hw_14 0 SO FROM HERE JUMP DO YOUR TWO SPINS
gmlvsCma0hw_15 0 THERE YOU GO AND BE ABLE TO LAND ON YOUR FEET
gmlvsCma0hw_16 0 SO ONE MORE TIME JUMP TWO SPINS
gmlvsCma0hw_18 0 AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A JUMP 720 SPIN
gmlvsCma0hw_19 0 SO AS I DO IT I'M GOING TO STEP HERE STEP TOGETHER
gmlvsCma0hw_20 0 I'M GOING TO STEP I'M GOING TO KIND OF CHEAT A LITTLE BIT I'M NOT GOING TO FACE DIRECTLY TO THE FRONT
gmlvsCma0hw_21 0 I'M GOING TO KINDA GO AT AN ANGLE AND JUMP FROM HERE JUMP THROW MY ARM TWIST IN TIGHTEN AND SPIN OUT ONE TWO BAM AND YOU WANT TO GET ALL THE WAY TO A SOLID LANDING
gmlvsCma0hw_23 0 SO YOUR JUMP IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY CRUCIAL TO THE 720
giD2nI3tfGc_2 0 THIS IS JIM GOETTLER WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
giD2nI3tfGc_3 0 THIS IS A VIDEO ABOUT HOW TO PRODUCE A SMALL COMMUNITY FESTIVAL
giD2nI3tfGc_4 0 IN THIS SEGMENT I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT GARBAGE AND RECYCLING
giD2nI3tfGc_5 0 IT IS A BASIC ELEMENT OF EVERY FESTIVAL SO WE MIGHT AS WELL GET INTO IT AS WE SAY
giD2nI3tfGc_6 0 YOU NEED TO CONTACT A LOCAL GARBAGE HAULER
giD2nI3tfGc_7 0 YOUR PERMIT WILL REQUIRE THAT YOU HAVE GARBAGE CANS ON SITE
giD2nI3tfGc_8 0 IT MAY REQUIRE YOU HAVE A DUMPSTER ON SITE
giD2nI3tfGc_9 0 GET TO KNOW THESE FOLKS
giD2nI3tfGc_10 0 THEY ARE GOING TO HELP YOU CONSIDERABLY BECAUSE THEY WILL BE ABLE TO HELP YOU PLACE YOUR GARBAGE CANS PLACE YOUR DUMPSTER SO THAT THE PUBLIC CAN MAKE USE OF IT YET IT STAYS OUT OF THE FLOW OF THE EVENT
giD2nI3tfGc_11 0 SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND IS IF YOU ARE IN PART OF THE COUNTRY WHERE IT RAINS A LOT
giD2nI3tfGc_12 0 KEEP IN MIND THAT GARBAGE IS GENERALLY HAULED OUT BY WEIGHT WHICH MEANS IF IT IS A RAINY DAY IT COULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE FOR YOU TO PAY THE HAUL FEE
giD2nI3tfGc_13 0 ONE ROUTE AROUND THAT IS TO ASK YOUR HAULER TO SUPPLY YOU WIT RECYCLING CONTAINERS
giD2nI3tfGc_14 0 MOST FOLKS ARE NOW RECYCLING SO THERE IS AN EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT
giD2nI3tfGc_15 0 THEY OFTEN SUPPLY RECYCLING CONTAINERS WHICH WILL DECREASE THE OVERALL COST YOU ARE PAYING TO HAVE YOUR GARBAGE HAULED OUT OF THERE
giD2nI3tfGc_16 0 IT IS SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT
giD2nI3tfGc_17 0 I STRONGLY SUGGEST IT
giD2nI3tfGc_18 0 IT LOOKS GOOD
giD2nI3tfGc_19 0 IT MAKES PEOPLE AWARE THAT YOU ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY AWARE OF WHAT IS GOING ON AND FRANKLY IT HELPS KEEP THE BILL DOWN BY SEPARATING THAT GARBAGE AND GETTING IT HAULED OUT AT A REASONABLE RATE
giD2nI3tfGc_20 0 THE NEXT SEGMENT I AM GOING TO TOUCH ON FIRST AID FOR YOUR FESTIVAL AND WAYS YOU MIGHT ADDRESS IT
giD2nI3tfGc_21 0 STAY WITH ME
hIewTK29XRc_1 0 NEIL HUBBARD SO THERE'S A FEW TIPS AND POINTERS THAT I WANTED TO ADD ON
hIewTK29XRc_2 0 ONE IS PUTTING A LITTLE PIECE OF RUBBER TUBING THIS IS BASICALLY LIKE SURGICAL TUBING ON THE END OF YOUR BLOWPIPE JUST MAKES IT A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE YOU DON'T WANT TO BITE ON THE THING BUT IT JUST MAKES IT A LITTLE EASIER IN YOUR MOUTH
hIewTK29XRc_3 0 ON THE INSIDE OF MY BAG I HAVE A PIECE OF THIS RUBBER STUFF THAT KEEPS THE BAG FROM SLIPPING WHEN IT'S AGAINST YOUR BODY
hIewTK29XRc_4 0 AFTER YOU PUT IT UP UNDER YOUR ARM YOU WANT IT TO STAY THERE YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE SLIDING DOWN AND CAUSING DISCOMFORT
hIewTK29XRc_5 0 THE OTHER THING IS YOU WANT TO STAND STRAIGHT WHILE YOU'RE PLAYING
hIewTK29XRc_6 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO HUNCH YOUR SHOULDER UP
hIewTK29XRc_7 0 YOU WANT TO GET YOUR BLOWPIPE ADJUSTED EITHER BY A SHORTER ONE OR A LONGER ONE OR THEY DO MAKE ADJUSTABLE ONES BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE YOU KNOW CROOKING YOUR HEAD IN THERE TO GET TO THE BLOWPIPE OR YOU DON'T WANT IT WAY BACK YOU KNOW AGAINST THERE
hIewTK29XRc_8 0 YOU WANT TO BE COMFORTABLE WHILE YOU'RE PLAYING STAND IN A NORMAL POSTURE WITH YOUR HEELS TOGETHER
hIewTK29XRc_9 0 ALSO AS I STRIKE IN THE BAG IT'S CALLED STRIKING IT IN YOU'LL SEE ME SORT OF PUSH THE BAG WITH MY HAND TO GET THE REED STARTED [PLAYS BAGPIPES] AND THEN MAKE A NICE CLEAN CUT OFF BY STOPPING BREATHING IN AND SQUEEZING THE AIR OUT OF THE BAG TO THE POINT WHERE I CAN RELEASE MY ARM QUICKLY AND IT SHUTS OFF LIKE A LIGHT SWITCH
HJJ9QcOhYYw_1 0 THE NEXT PRODUCT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS ONE OF THE FIRST NATURAL OILS

GbeZtULzjnk_1 0 SO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I GET ASKED A LOT IS WHAT DO I DO WITH MY PHOTOGRAPHS
GbeZtULzjnk_2 0 AND YOU KNOW HOW DO I BEGIN TO SHOW THEM
GbeZtULzjnk_3 0 OR WHAT DO I DO IN TERMS TO GET A SHOW
GbeZtULzjnk_4 0 AND HAVING A SHOW MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE
GbeZtULzjnk_5 0 SOME PEOPLE MIGHT CONSIDER HAVING A SHOW A SHOW IN A GALLERY OR A SHOW IN A MUSEUM
GbeZtULzjnk_6 0 OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT CONSIDER HAVING A SHOW A SHOW IN A RESTAURANT OR COFFEE SHOP OR A LIBRARY IN A PUBLIC PLACE
GbeZtULzjnk_7 0 AND ALL THOSE ARE REALLY GREAT PLACES TO BEGIN HAVING A SHOW
GbeZtULzjnk_8 0 BUT THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF PREP WORK YOU WANT TO DO BEFORE YOU TRY TO SHOW YOUR WORK OUT IN PUBLIC
GbeZtULzjnk_9 0 ONE OF THE BEST WAYS THAT I KNOW TO START COLLATING YOUR WORK IS THINK OF A SUBJECT OR A THEME THAT YOU WANT YOUR SHOW TO BE OF
GbeZtULzjnk_10 0 NOW IT COULD BE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS TO BE NATURE OR IT COULD BE AS COMPLEX TO WHERE IT'S YOU KNOW A PROJECT IN YOUR COMMUNITY THAT YOU'RE DOCUMENTING
GbeZtULzjnk_11 0 BUT ONCE YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IN THAT WAY IT WILL MAKE GATHERING YOUR WORK TOGETHER TO GET A SHOW MUCH EASIER FOR YOU AND MUCH EASIER FOR YOU TO TALK ABOUT
GbeZtULzjnk_12 0 WHAT YOUR WORK IS ABOUT
GNVKkKcb--U_1 0 HELLO I'M SHIFU MALLON WITH THE CLEARWATER KUNG FU CENTER

GNVKkKcb--U_5 0 FROM HERE MY LEFT FOOT COMES TO RIGHT FOOT CHAMBER THE RIGHT HAND
GNVKkKcb--U_6 0 MY LEFT HAND PERFORMS A CIRCLE OVERHEAD PALM BLOCK
GNVKkKcb--U_7 0 I PERFORM RIGHT FIST STANDING PUNCH
GNVKkKcb--U_8 0 BOTH PALMS COME FORWARD CIRCLE LIFT PUSH DOWN AND LOOK LEFT
GNVKkKcb--U_9 0 HAVE MELISSA STEP FORWARD AND WE'LL GO THROUGH IT SLOW SO YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE FINER POINTS
GNVKkKcb--U_10 0 SO HER RIGHT KNEE IS UP CRANE HER RIGHT ARM IS IN ROLLING BLOCK AND LEFT HAND IS OUT TO THE SIDE
GNVKkKcb--U_11 0 AGAIN SHE'S GOING TO ALLOW THE RIGHT FOOT TO DROP STRAIGHT DOWN HEEL TOE STEP OUT BOW
GNVKkKcb--U_12 0 AS SHE DOES THIS THE FORWARD HAND COMES IN AND BACK FISTING OUT
GNVKkKcb--U_13 0 NOW TO FINISH IT THE RIGHT HAND IS GOING TO CHAMBER SAME TIME AS HER LEFT FOOT STEPS UP
GNVKkKcb--U_14 0 SO RIGHT HAND IS GOING TO PULL IN THIS WAY HER LEFT FOOT STEPS FORWARD TO HER RIGHT FOOT BRINGING HER FEET TOGETHER
GNVKkKcb--U_15 0 NOW AS THIS POINT HER LEFT OPENS AND COMES OVERHEAD PALM BLOCKING NOW AS SHE'S GOING TO TURN HER TORSO THIS WAY USING THE HAND
GNVKkKcb--U_16 0 AT THIS POINT THE RIGHT HAND IS GOING TO FIRE OUT LIKE THE BEGINNING OF THE TANTUI PUNCHING FORWARD AND OUT
GNVKkKcb--U_17 0 THE REAR HAND OR LEFT HAND IS DOWN BY THE RIBS BLOCKING AND THIS IS IN A STANDING PUNCH POSITION SO FIST IS STANDING UP
GNVKkKcb--U_18 0 TO FINISH IT BOTH ARMS GO FORWARD PALMS UP FACING YOU GOOD
GNVKkKcb--U_19 0 SO AS THIS HAND COMES OUT FROM THIS POSITION THE HANDS GO OPEN HEAD TURNS FORWARD AND PALMS ARE UP

gY2MmDH0qz0_1 0 AFTER REMOVING YOUR ORIGINAL DOORKNOB IN ORDER TO REPLACE IT WITH A NEW ONE YOU'LL THEN WANT TO REMOVE THE LATCH BOLT STRIKE PLATE AND SPINDLE WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THE LATCH BOLT
gY2MmDH0qz0_2 0 AND YOU CAN START THIS BY REMOVING THE PHILLIPS HEAD SCREWS WITH YOUR PHILLIPS HEAD SCREWDRIVER THAT ARE HOLDING IT IN
gY2MmDH0qz0_3 0 NOW YOU COULD JUST USE YOUR NORMAL ONE YOUR NORMAL HAND POWERED SCREWDRIVER
gY2MmDH0qz0_4 0 BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET THE JOB DONE QUICK YOU CAN GO FOR THE GOOD OLD ELECTRIC SCREWDRIVER
gY2MmDH0qz0_5 0 AND MAKE SURE IT'S SET TO GO ANTI-CLOCKWISE CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO RUIN THE HEADS OF THE SCREWS BY TURNING IT THE WRONG WAY
gY2MmDH0qz0_6 0 AND THEN IN LIKE TWO SECONDS THEY COME OUT
gY2MmDH0qz0_7 0 THEN YOU WANT TO GET YOUR FLATHEAD SCREWDRIVER
gY2MmDH0qz0_8 0 NOW MAKE SURE IT'S A THIN ONE SO THAT YOU CAN EASILY GET INSIDE AND BEHIND THE STRIKE PLATE
gY2MmDH0qz0_9 0 GENTLY PRY OUT AS TO NOT DAMAGE THE DOOR AROUND THE STRIKE PLATE
gY2MmDH0qz0_10 0 AND THEN IT SHOULD JUST COME OUT EASILY LIKE THAT
GTEfPpALpmI_1 0 ANOTHER ASPECT TO BOWING WHILE PLAYING IS USING DIFFERENT BOW SPEEDS BECAUSE YOUR BOW ISN'T ALWAYS GOING TO BE GOING AT THE SAME PACE THROUGHOUT THE SAME PACE
GTEfPpALpmI_2 0 ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE PARTS WHERE THERE'S A TREMOLO
GTEfPpALpmI_3 0 YOUR BOW SPEED IS GOING TO CHANGE DRAMATICALLY AND IT'S GOING TO BECOME VERY VERY FAST
GTEfPpALpmI_4 0 DEMO AND IF IT'S A VERY KIND OF LIKE ADAGIO MORE SLOW SECTION OF THE PIECE YOUR BOW SPEEDS GOING TO BE VERY VERY SLOW
GTEfPpALpmI_5 0 DEMO THE BOW SPEED KIND OF THINK OF AS GOING ALONG NOT ONLY WITH THE DYNAMICS BUT WITH THE PARTICULAR PATTERNS AND THAT PART OF THE MUSIC
GTEfPpALpmI_6 0 FOR REALLY KIND OF LOUD AND REALLY INTENSE PATTERNS YOU MIGHT HAVE
GTEfPpALpmI_7 0 PARTS AND PIECES YOU MIGHT HAVE SECTIONS WHERE YOUR BOW IS MATCHING THAT LOUDNESS BY BOWING REALLY REALLY HARD AND REALLY FAST
GTEfPpALpmI_8 0 DEMO OR ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE DOING SPICCATO YOUR BOW IS GOING TO CHANGE AS WELL
GTEfPpALpmI_9 0 DEMO SO THERE'S DIFFERENT BOW SPEEDS

GkeIkf21fJI_6 0 I DON'T WANT ANY TRANSPARENCY FOR THIS ONE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU ON THE NEXT CLIP HOW TO SAVE A TRANSPARENT GIF AND THE DIFFERENCES IN THAT

GkeIkf21fJI_10 0 PHOTOSHOP ALSO HAS THIS GREAT LITTLE FEATURE WHERE IT WILL ACTUALLY LIKE CREATE AN HTML CODE FOR WHATEVER YOU'RE SAVING FOR THE WEB BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE REALLY WANT TO USE
GkeIkf21fJI_11 0 AND SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO IMAGES ONLY AND IT'S JUST GOING TO SAVE THAT BACKGROUND_DOT.GIF
GUiRw5Oy_EA_1 0 THE FOURTH LAYER OF THE INTERACTION OF THE CONTINUOUS EFFECT DEALS WITH TYPE
GUiRw5Oy_EA_2 0 THE TYPE ALSO EFFECTS SUBTYPE AND SUPER TYPE
GUiRw5Oy_EA_3 0 WHAT IT SAYS IS THAT ANY CARD THAT CHANGES THE CHARACTERISTICS ON THE TYPE LINE THAT IS TO SAY BETWEEN THE PICTURE AND THE TEXT IS APPLIED IN THE FOURTH LAYER OF INTERACTION
GUiRw5Oy_EA_4 0 LIGNIFY IS ENCHANT CREATURE THAT MEANS THAT IT IS ATTACHED TO A CREATURE THAT SAYS THAT WHATEVER IT'S ATTACHED TO BECOMES A ZERO FOUR IT BECOMES A TREE FOLK AND IT LOOSES ALL OF ITS ABILITIES
GUiRw5Oy_EA_5 0 SO WHEN IT'S ATTACHED TO DOMINATING LICID IT'S NO LONGER A LICID TYPE CREATURE BUT IT'S A TREE FOLK
GUiRw5Oy_EA_6 0 NOTICE THAT ONLY THE PART OF THE CARD THAT SAYS IT'S A TREE FOLK IS APPLIED IN LAYER FOUR
GUiRw5Oy_EA_7 0 THE ZERO FOUR AND THE LOSS OF ABILITIES ARE EACH APPLIED IN A SEPARATE LAYER
GI5KqKHJRec_1 0 WE'RE TRYING TO GO WITH THE LEFT
GI5KqKHJRec_2 0 TAKE THE RIGHT FOOT AWAY FROM YOU AND TURN YOUR LEFT TOES IN SO THAT YOUR RIGHT HEEL IS IN LINE WITH THAT LEFT ANKLE
GI5KqKHJRec_3 0 TAKE YOUR PROP IN CASE YOU NEED IT AND LAY IT DOWN BUT STAND IT UP TO START OFF WITH
GI5KqKHJRec_4 0 TAKE YOUR HAND AGAINST YOUR HIP AND BRING YOUR PELVIS FORWARD
GI5KqKHJRec_5 0 TAKE YOUR RIGHT ARM DOWN GET OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BODY BY REACHING UP WITH THAT LEFT HAND
GI5KqKHJRec_6 0 REACHING UP WITH THAT LEFT HAND YOU CAN HOLD IT RIGHT UP HIGH AND YOU CAN LOWER THE RIGHT HAND RIGHT DOWN TOWARDS THAT FLOOR BUT TURN YOUR FACE UP TOWARDS THE LEFT HAND
GI5KqKHJRec_7 0 NOW THAT'S WHERE THAT BLOCK COMES IN HANDY YOU CAN REST YOUR HAND RIGHT UP ON THE BLOCK YOU CAN LAY THE BLOCK DOWN FOR SECURITY OR YOU CAN TAKE YOUR HAND RIGHT DOWN TO THE FOOT BUT IN ANY CASE YOUR EYES STAY ON THAT LEFT HAND
GI5KqKHJRec_8 0 LIFT UP BREATHE IN DEEP THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND EXHALE ANOTHER DEEP BREATH IN AND EXHALE AND ANOTHER DEEP BREATH IN AS YOU REACH AND LIFTING UP WITH THAT LEFT HIP
GI5KqKHJRec_9 0 BREATHE IN DEEP AGAIN AND EXHALE

GI5KqKHJRec_11 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO FEEL THAT LEFT ARM EXTENDING UP HIGH ANOTHER DEEP BREATH IN AND EXHALE NOW RELEASE COME ALL THE WAY UP AND YOUR ARMS COME RIGHT DOWN
GI5KqKHJRec_12 0 SHAKE IT RIGHT OFF
gBEBqqP2ExU_2 0 MY NAME IS SHERYL WITH EXPERTVILLAGE.COM AND TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MOUNTING A POSTER OR A PHOTO
gBEBqqP2ExU_3 0 WHY WOULD YOU EVER WANT TO MOUNT A POSTER
gBEBqqP2ExU_4 0 I WANT TO TELL YOU TIMES THAT YOU WOULD THE BENEFITS OF DOING IT AND WHEN YOU WOULD NOT WANT TO MOUNT A POSTER
gBEBqqP2ExU_5 0 THIS PICTURE WAS JUST A SMALL PICTURE OF MY SON AND THIS THREE FRIENDS
gBEBqqP2ExU_6 0 WE WENT AHEAD AND BLEW THIS UP
gBEBqqP2ExU_7 0 IT'S VERY MOBILE
gBEBqqP2ExU_8 0 I CAN TAKE THIS WITH ME ANYWHERE
gBEBqqP2ExU_9 0 IT'S VERY LIGHTWEIGHT AND IT'S JUST A FUN POSTER TO BE ABLE TO TAKE AND HANG IT ON THE WALL OR TO BE ABLE TO TAKE IT ESPECIALLY IT BEING VERY MOBILE WHY WOULD I NOT WANT TO MOUNT A PICTURE
gBEBqqP2ExU_10 0 THE REASON I WOULD NOT WANT TO MOUNT A PHOTO IS IF IT IS AN ORIGINAL OR IF I WAS PLANNING ON PUTTING IT UNDER GLASS OR IF THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE BACK OF THIS POSTER FOR SOME REASON THAT I DID NOT WANT TO COVER THIS UP ESPECIALLY ORIGINALS YOU DO NOT WANT TO MOUNT ON A POSTER
h6C6_2K_cu0_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS DR SUSAN JEWELL AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO RECOGNIZE AND HOW TO TREAT THE SYNDROME OF RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME
h6C6_2K_cu0_2 0 NOW IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT POSITIONING AND SLEEPING HABITS
h6C6_2K_cu0_3 0 NOW MOST OF THE TIME WE ALWAYS HAVE A FAVORITE WAY TO SLEEP IN BED AND WHAT WE DO IS WE TEND TO LIE ON OUR SIDES FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND WE SCRUNCH UP OUR BODY AND WHEN YOU DO THIS YOU TEND TO COMPRESS THE LOWER ABDOMINAL AREA AND ALSO RESTRICT THE BLOOD FLOW TO THE LOWER EXTREMITIES OR THE LOWER LEGS AND THAT WOULD INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING THE RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME SO IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT WHILE YOU ARE SLEEPING A LOT OF TIMES IT IS GOOD TO CHANGE POSITIONS CONSTANTLY SO THAT YOU DON'T RESTRICT BLOOD FLOW TO YOUR LEGS AND ALSO TO CAUSE A LOT OF CONSTRICTION OF MUSCLES AROUND THIS AREA
h6C6_2K_cu0_4 0 IT IS BETTER IF YOU CAN TO SLEEP ON YOUR BACK OR FLAT OUT LIKE THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS OR COMPRESSION ON ANY PARTS OF YOUR BODY
h6C6_2K_cu0_5 0 ALSO IT WOULD BE GOOD BESIDES DOING THE CONSTANT CHANGING AROUND OF YOUR BODY IS TO GET A PILLOW LIKE WHAT I HAVE HERE IS A KIND OF CYLINDRICAL ROUND PILLOW AND IT IS GOOD TO PUT THIS UNDER YOUR LEGS AND THAT SORT OF HELPS TO ALLEVIATE THE CREEPY CRAWLY SENSATIONS IN YOUR LEGS
h6C6_2K_cu0_6 0 THESE ARE SOME OF THE WAYS THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRY TO USE TO TRY TO REDUCE THE SEVERITY OR THE INTENSITY OF THAT CREEPY CRAWLY SENSATION THAT YOU ENCOUNTER WHEN YOU GET THE RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME

GJ5G3leArpU_3 0 NOW YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SET IT TO ABOUT MEDIUM DEPENDING ON THE STOVE THAT YOU HAVE
GJ5G3leArpU_4 0 NOW YOU DON'T WANT TO SET IT TOO HOT CAUSE IF YOU SET IT TOO HOT IT POPS TOO FAST IT DOESN'T ALLOW ALL THE KERNELS TO GET POPPED BEFORE IT HAS TO YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF THE STOVE TOP THAT OR IT'S EASIER TO BURN
GJ5G3leArpU_5 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO SET IT TOO LOW BECAUSE IF YOU SET IT TOO LOW IT TAKES TOO LONG TO POP AND THE KERNELS SIT IN THE OIL TOO LONG

G74u7ZXm550_4 0 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO NEED FOR YOUR CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY TABLE
G74u7ZXm550_5 0 THERE IS A WIDE VARIETY OF THINGS BUT THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DECIDE ON IS WHAT IS YOUR THEME GOING TO BE

G74u7ZXm550_9 0 IS IT GOING TO BE GREEN AND WHITE BLUE AND WHITE BLUE AND SILVER
G74u7ZXm550_10 0 YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE AND WHAT YOU NEED
G74u7ZXm550_11 0 GO THROUGH YOUR TABLE LINENS
G74u7ZXm550_12 0 IF I WANT TO HAVE A RED AND WHITE THEME YOU SHOULD HAVE SOME RED AND WHITE TABLE LINENS
G74u7ZXm550_13 0 CHECK TO SEE WHAT YOU HAVE
G74u7ZXm550_14 0 IF YOU DECIDE YOU'RE GOING TO DO A SILVER PARTY AND YOU HAVE NOTHING SILVER THEN IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG EXPENSIVE AND TAKE THAT IN YOUR BUDGET

G74u7ZXm550_16 0 I HAVE PLATES GLASSES FLOWERS DECORATIONS LINENS AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO SET THE TABLE
G74u7ZXm550_17 0 I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOUR THEME IS GOING TO BE
hFELIz1icak_1 0 THIS EXAMPLE I'M GOING TO SHOW A VARIATION OF FINGER STYLE PATTERN USING SIMPLY THE A MINOR CHORD AGAIN
hFELIz1icak_2 0 AND IN THIS ONE I'M GOING TO SHOW TWO PINCHES USED IN THE PATTERN INSTEAD OF JUST ONE THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO USE TWO UTILIZING JUST THE OPEN NOTE IN BETWEEN THE PINCHES
hFELIz1icak_3 0 SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO HERE IS GO
hFELIz1icak_4 0 AND BASICALLY WHAT I'M DOING THERE IS TWO PINCHES
hFELIz1icak_5 0 TWO PINCHES BETWEEN THE A AND THE HIGH E STRING
hFELIz1icak_6 0 AND THEN HIT THE G AND THEN A PINCH BETWEEN THE D OR IN THIS CASE FRETTING MAKES IT AN E NOTE WITH E HIGH E AND THEN OPEN B OR ACTUALLY NOT AN OPEN B IT'S GOING TO BE C FIRST FINGER SECOND FRET ON THE A MINOR CHORD
hFELIz1icak_7 0 SO SLOWLY IT'S GOING TO BE
hFELIz1icak_8 0 AND AGAIN USING TWO PINCHES AND WITH THE NOTE IN BETWEEN EACH ONE
hFELIz1icak_9 0 AND WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING IT UP TO A FASTER SPEED IT SOUNDS NICE AND HAS A FULLER SOUND
hFELIz1icak_10 0 SO TO PLAY IT UP TO SPEED
hFELIz1icak_11 0 THAT'S ANOTHER VARIATION OF THE FINGER STYLE PATTERN USING THE KEY OF A MINOR
gJ8Tcumwnlw_1 0 WHEN YOU ARE SWIMMING AGGRESSIVELY IN CURRENTS A LOT OF THE TIME IN A RESCUE SITUATION YOU NEED TO GET AN ACCESS MIDSTREAM OR SIDE OF THE RIVER EDDIES
gJ8Tcumwnlw_2 0 THIS REQUIRES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SKILL AND ALSO ENTERING IN THE RIGHT PLACE REALLY COUNTS A LOT
gJ8Tcumwnlw_3 0 JUST LIKE IN A KAYAK RAFT OR CANOE YOU WANT TO ENTER EDDIES AS HIGH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN
gJ8Tcumwnlw_4 0 FOR EXAMPLE IF WE ARE SWIMMING DOWN THIS CURRENT AND YOU ARE GOING TO ENTER INTO THE EDDY OUT IN THE MIDDLE BEHIND THAT BOULDER
gJ8Tcumwnlw_5 0 YOU WANT TO ENTER NICE AND HIGH AGGRESSIVELY SWIMMING IN A COOL TYPE STROKE TO GET INTO THE EDDY
gJ8Tcumwnlw_6 0 ONCE YOU HIT THE EDDY LINE YOU CAN THEN START BARRELING DOWN STREAM
gJ8Tcumwnlw_7 0 WHAT THIS DOES IS IT STOPS YOUR BUDDY FROM GETTING SWUNG PARALLEL TO THE RIVER CURRENT AND GETTING STOPPED RIGHT ON THE EDDY LINE AND IT HELPS YOU PENETRATE ALL THE WAY INTO THE EDDY

gS3MnTPVqjU_17 0 AND FROM THERE HE ARCHES BACK
gS3MnTPVqjU_18 0 AND IT'S OVER
gS3MnTPVqjU_20 0 IN REAL LIFETIME NOW
gS3MnTPVqjU_21 0 I TRY TO KEEP HIM AWAY
gS3MnTPVqjU_22 0 GRABS IT STEPS
gS3MnTPVqjU_23 0 AND IT'S OVER
G-TMtHTXJVM_1 0 SO NEXT WE'RE GOING TO CONCENTRATE ON THE MIDDLE PORTION OF THE SUN SALUTATION
G-TMtHTXJVM_2 0 SO OUR DOWNWARD FACING DOG TO OUR PLANK TO OUR CHATURANGA TO OUR UPWARD FACING DOG
G-TMtHTXJVM_3 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THAT MIDDLE PART CHOOSING SOME KNEELING OPTIONS FOR THOSE POSES
G-TMtHTXJVM_4 0 SO AS WE'VE STEPPED BACK WITH OUR RIGHT LEG INTO A NICE DEEP LUNGE FROM HERE IF WE WANT TO CHOOSE A KNEELING OPTIONS WE'LL DROP TO THE KNEE AND UNCURL THE TOE
G-TMtHTXJVM_5 0 AND THEN FROM HERE WE'LL BRING THE LEFT LEG BACK AND WE'LL FIND EXTENDED CHILD'S POSE
G-TMtHTXJVM_6 0 WE'RE SITTING BACK TO OUR HEELS REACHING OUR ARMS AWAY OUR HANDS ARE ABOUT SHOULDER DISTANCE APART HERE
G-TMtHTXJVM_7 0 AND FROM HERE AS WE INHALE WE'RE AGAIN BRINGING OUR SHOULDERS OVER OUR WRISTS TO FIND A KNEELING PLANK POSITION
G-TMtHTXJVM_8 0 AND THEN TO FIND CHATURANGA IN A KNEELING POSITION IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO FULL POSITION WE'LL SHIFT SLOWLY FORWARD LOWERING OUR ELBOWS TIGHT TO THE BODY
G-TMtHTXJVM_9 0 NOW THIS IS WHERE IT GETS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT
G-TMtHTXJVM_10 0 RATHER THAN UPWARD FACING DOG WE'RE GOING TO LOWER ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND LIFTING THE CHEST
G-TMtHTXJVM_11 0 CHEST SLIGHTLY FEEL LITTLE TINY BABY COBRA
G-TMtHTXJVM_12 0 AND FROM HERE WE'LL PUSH BACK UP IN COMING BACK TO EXTENDED CHILD'S POSE
G-TMtHTXJVM_13 0 AND FROM EXTENDED CHILD'S POSE WE WANT TO COME UP AND BRING THAT RIGHT FOOT BACK BETWEEN THE HANDS A LITTLE HARDER WHEN YOU'RE KNEELING BUT THAT'S OKAY
h4wXfn9IwSo_1 0 MY NAME IS ANTHONY MADDALONI AND I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO BECOME A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER
h4wXfn9IwSo_2 0 A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER IS A PHOTOGRAPHER THAT REALLY WEARS A LOT OF HATS SO TO SPEAK
h4wXfn9IwSo_3 0 A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER CAN PHOTOGRAPH THE EXHIBITS GOING ON IN A MUSEUM MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER CAN ALSO TAKE IMAGES OF THE MUSEUM'S COLLECTIONS
h4wXfn9IwSo_4 0 SO THAT IS ONE PART ABOUT BEING A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER THAT REQUIRES QUITE A BIT OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE AND HOW TO PHOTOGRAPH DOCUMENTS HOW TO PHOTOGRAPH ART WORK PAINTINGS YOU MIGHT EVEN BE PHOTOGRAPHING PHOTOGRAPHS
h4wXfn9IwSo_5 0 SO DOING THAT IS ACTUALLY PRETTY INTERESTING YOU'LL BE USING STROBE YOU MIGHT EVEN BE USING DIGITAL SCANNERS YOU'LL BE USING DIGITAL CAMERAS AND MAYBE USING FILM CAMERAS
h4wXfn9IwSo_6 0 ALL THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TOOLS THAT ARE AT THE PHOTOGRAPHERS TOOL BOX SO TO SPEAK WILL CREATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF IMAGES FOR A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER
h4wXfn9IwSo_7 0 THERE'S ALSO QUITE A BIT OF COPYRIGHT THAT YOU HAVE TO KNOW CAN I DO THIS
h4wXfn9IwSo_8 0 ONE REALLY INTERESTING TERM I HEARD A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER ONCE SAID IS THAT I AM NOT IMPROVING UPON ART MEANING THAT YOU ARE JUST PHOTOGRAPHING THE ART WORK
h4wXfn9IwSo_9 0 YOU ARE NOT REALLY TRYING TO MAKE THAT PAINTING OR SCULPTURE ANY BETTER YOU ARE JUST DOCUMENTING IT
h4wXfn9IwSo_10 0 AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY AN INTERESTING WAY TO LOOK AT IT
h4wXfn9IwSo_11 0 ONE OTHER WAY TO LOOK AT IT TOO IS THAT PAINTINGS DON'T TALK BACK
h4wXfn9IwSo_12 0 I'M A PHOTOGRAPHER THAT PHOTOGRAPHS A LOT OF PEOPLE AND I'M USED TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PERSONALITIES WHEN I AM PHOTOGRAPHING
h4wXfn9IwSo_13 0 BUT WHEN I AM PHOTOGRAPHING A PAINTING OR A PIECE OF ART WORK IN THE STUDIO THEY ARE NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING BACK TO ME WHETHER IT BE POSITIVE OR GOOD OR THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE THEIR PICTURE TAKEN
h4wXfn9IwSo_14 0 SO THAT'S KIND OF COOL IN ON SOME DAYS WHERE I JUST WANT TO PHOTOGRAPH SOMETHING AND NOT BE BOTHERED
h4wXfn9IwSo_15 0 SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE WAYS THAT YOU CAN BECOME A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER AND AGAIN I WOULD ALSO SPEND A DAY WITH A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE
h4wXfn9IwSo_16 0 SEE IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN
h4wXfn9IwSo_17 0 AND YOU KNOW THERE'S CERTAIN PROGRAMS THAT YOU CAN ARCHIVIST PROGRAMS WHERE YOU COULD SEE EXACTLY WHAT A MUSEUM DOES
h4wXfn9IwSo_18 0 AND THAT IS SOME OF THE TIPS THAT I WOULD SAY TO SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BECOME A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER
gImBKT9w0Mk_1 0 HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
gImBKT9w0Mk_2 0 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN OUR CENTER GOES DOWN TO SNAP THE BALL THAT WE DON'T GET ANY PENALTIES
gImBKT9w0Mk_3 0 ONE PENALTY IS THE OFF SIDES PENALTY
gImBKT9w0Mk_4 0 A LOT OF TIMES THAT COMES FROM A GUY EITHER NOT LISTENING TO THE CADENCE HE'S NOT WATCHING THE BALL OR HE'S TOO FAR FROM THE BALL AND MAKES A MISTAKE BY JUMPING OFF SIDES PREMATURELY
gImBKT9w0Mk_5 0 THERE CAN BE AN OFF SIDES PENALTY AGAINST THE CENTER FOR MOVING OR MANIPULATING THE BALL TO THROW OFF THE DEFENSE
gImBKT9w0Mk_6 0 WHEN HE GOES DOWN ON THE BALL HE HAS TO GET SET
gImBKT9w0Mk_7 0 THE BALL WILL BE LAYING ON THE GROUND AND MAY BE TURNED TO THE SIDE
gImBKT9w0Mk_8 0 HE'S ALLOWED TO GRAB THE BALL TO GET IT SET BUT ONCE HE GETS THAT BALL SET HE CAN'T MOVE IT
gImBKT9w0Mk_9 0 HE CAN'T BE TILTING IT BACK TO HIM BECAUSE THE DEFENDER MAY THINK HE'S TRYING TO FAKE THE SNAP
gImBKT9w0Mk_10 0 HE DEFINITELY CANNOT LIFT THE BALL UP AT ANY POINT ANY TIME
gImBKT9w0Mk_11 0 HE CAN'T LIFT IT OR MOVE IT OR REPOSITION IT
gImBKT9w0Mk_12 0 ANYTIME THAT BALL COMES UP OR IS MOVED IF THE OFFICIALS CATCH IT THAT WILL BE CALLED AS AN OFFSIDE S
gImBKT9w0Mk_13 0 ONCE YOU GET THAT BALL LOCKED AND READY YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT THERE
gImBKT9w0Mk_14 0 YOU CAN'T BE MOVING THAT BALL AROUND
gImBKT9w0Mk_15 0 THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO COST YOUR TEAM FIVE YARDS
GrBZZfFbDog_1 0 ANY TIME THAT YOU ARE OUTSIDE PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE SPENDING TIME OUTSIDE BY YOURSELF YOU WANT TO BE SURE THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF ALLERGIES TO INSECT BITES OR STINGS THAT YOU ARE WELL PREPARED FOR IT
GrBZZfFbDog_2 0 IF YOU HAVE AN EPINEPHRINE PEN BE SURE THAT YOU KEEP THAT HANDY WITH YOU AND IT MIGHT ALWAYS BE A GOOD IDEA IF YOU HAVE SERIOUS ALLERGIES TO BEES AND WASPS AND THAT SORT OF THING THAT YOU JUST CHECK IN WITH SOMEBODY BEFORE YOU GO SPEND YOUR TIME OUTSIDE AND THEN THAT YOU CHECK BACK IN WITH THEM AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME
GrBZZfFbDog_3 0 AND THAT WAY JUST IT JUST SORT OF PUTS SOMEBODY ON ALERT IF THEY HAVEN'T HEARD BACK FROM YOU
GrBZZfFbDog_4 0 YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN AN ACCIDENTAL STING IS GOING TO HAPPEN OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T PLAN FOR ACCIDENTS
GrBZZfFbDog_5 0 SO IT'S A SERIOUS CONSIDERATION
GrBZZfFbDog_6 0 BE SURE TO KEEP YOUR EPINEPHRINE YOUR BENADRYL WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU NEED TO USE IN AN EMERGENCY HANDY AND THAT WILL HELP YOU FEEL SAFE AND RELAXED OUTSIDE
grR8kJlpJ_4_1 0 ALL RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ALL THE SEASONINGS IN BUT BEFORE THEY GET A CHANCE TO BURN YOU GO AHEAD AND ADD A HALF A CUP OF WHITE WINE AND A LITTLE LESS THAN A FOURTH A CUP OF WHITE WINE VINEGAR
grR8kJlpJ_4_2 0 NOW WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR THAT TO REDUCE WE'RE GOING TO GET OUR BOWL AND OUR STRAINER AND ONE LEMON
grR8kJlpJ_4_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE STRAINER RIGHT OVER THE BOWL GOING TO CUT THIS LEMON IN HALF
grR8kJlpJ_4_4 0 AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SQUEEZE RIGHT OVER THE TOP
grR8kJlpJ_4_5 0 AND THE REASON WHY WE DO THIS INSTEAD OF DOING IT STRAIGHT INTO OUR SAUTE PAN IS THAT YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE SEEDS HERE AND SO WE DON'T WANT ANYONE TO CHOKE ON THE SEEDS WHEN THEY'RE EATING THIS DISH
grR8kJlpJ_4_6 0 AND WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO BE STICKING OUR FINGERS IN TO PULL THEM OUT
grR8kJlpJ_4_7 0 AFTER WE'VE JUICED THE LEMON WE'LL ADD IT TO OUR SHRIMP
H3kuHP_DqR4_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO SHOW HOW TO INSTALL A WINDOW IN THE SAIL
H3kuHP_DqR4_2 0 SO DURING THE LAYOUT PROCESS WE PUT THE MARKS ON THE PANEL WHERE THE WINDOW'S GOING TO GO
H3kuHP_DqR4_3 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO USE A TWENTY GAUGE CLEAR VINYL FOR THE WINDOW
H3kuHP_DqR4_4 0 SO I'M JUST GOING TO MAKE A ROUGH CUT ON THE VINYL BIGGER THAN OUR WINDOW AND WE'LL STICK THE WINDOW ONTO THE PANEL AND MAKE THE PROPER CUTS THEN SIZE IT PROPERLY
H3kuHP_DqR4_5 0 ONE THING TO REMEMBER IS ALWAYS CUT THE PANEL BEFORE YOU STICK THE WINDOW ON
H3kuHP_DqR4_6 0 SO RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO PUT A NASTY CUT IN THE PANEL
H3kuHP_DqR4_7 0 SO FOR THE WINDOW WE'VE ALREADY DRAWN THE WINDOW PERIMETER AND NOW I'M GOING TO LAY DOWN STICKY TAPE ALONG THE WINDOW PERIMETER
H3kuHP_DqR4_8 0 THE KEY TO GOOD TAPING IS TO LET THE TAPE RELAX AS IT HITS THE CLOTH
H3kuHP_DqR4_9 0 SO THERE WE HAVE THAT TAPE
H3kuHP_DqR4_10 0 WE'LL PEEL ONE EDGE AND STICK THE VINYL DOWN
H3kuHP_DqR4_11 0 YOU WANT TO PAT VINYL AND NOT PULL ALONG TAPE BECAUSE THE VINYL WILL STRETCH AND THEN SHRINK AS IT HITS THE CLOTH AND YOU'LL END UP WITH A WRINKLY WINDOW
H3kuHP_DqR4_12 0 IF YOU TRIM CLOCK WISE AROUND YOU CAN GET THE SCISSOR EDGE RIGHT NEXT TO THE TAPE
H3kuHP_DqR4_13 0 ONE THE CLOTH SIDE GETTING THE SCISSORS RIGHT NEXT TO THE TAPE WILL HELP PREVENT FRAYING
H3kuHP_DqR4_14 0 AFTER CUTTING THE VINYL OFF WE CAN FLIP THE PANEL OVER AND CUT OUT THE CLOTH ON THE BACK SIDE
H3kuHP_DqR4_15 0 NOW WE'VE ALREADY MADE OUR SLIT IN THE CLOTH
H3kuHP_DqR4_16 0 YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU HAVEN'T MADE A SLIT AND AFTER YOU SEW IT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE SAIL CLOTH WITHOUT POKING A HOLE IN THE VINYL TOO
H3kuHP_DqR4_17 0 SO DON'T FORGET TO MAKE YOUR SLIT IN ADVANCE
H3kuHP_DqR4_18 0 SO THERE WE HAVE A FINISHED WINDOW IN THE SAIL
H3kuHP_DqR4_19 0 WE'LL GO AHEAD AND TAKE THIS TO THE MACHINE AND SEW BOTH EDGES OF THE PERIMETER
H3kuHP_DqR4_20 0 SO TWO ROWS OF SEWING ALL THE WAY AROUND THE WINDOW
GYFESeYnL1M_1 0 HI I'M TY BROWN WITH DOGBEHAVIORONLINE.COM
GYFESeYnL1M_2 0 WE'RE HERE IN RIVERTON UTAH TODAY TEACHING YOU HOW TO TRAIN A DOG
GYFESeYnL1M_3 0 THE TOPIC OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION IS TEACHING YOU HOW TO TRAIN A DOG NOT TO BITE
GYFESeYnL1M_4 0 NOW THERE'S TWO MAIN TYPES OF WAYS THAT DOGS BITE
GYFESeYnL1M_5 0 NUMBER ONE YOU HAVE PUPPIES THAT BITE
GYFESeYnL1M_6 0 NOW PUPPIES THAT BITE THAT'S A VERY NATURAL THING FOR A PUPPY TO DO
GYFESeYnL1M_7 0 IF YOU OBSERVE PUPPIES PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER THEY BITE THEY NIP THEY GROWL THEY PLAY
GYFESeYnL1M_8 0 AND SO IT'S VERY NATURAL BUT IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE WITH HUMANS
GYFESeYnL1M_9 0 AND SO WITH A PUPPY WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS JUST SIMPLY USE A LEASH GIVE A LITTLE TUG AS HE BITES TELL HIM NO AND IMMEDIATELY REDIRECT HIS ATTENTION TOWARDS A TOY OR SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S PRODUCTIVE RATHER THAN DESTRUCTIVE
GYFESeYnL1M_10 0 NOW FOR AN ADULT DOG THAT BITES THAT'S ACTUALLY SYMPTOMATIC OF MUCH DEEPER PROBLEMS
GYFESeYnL1M_11 0 AND IF YOU HAVE AN ADULT DOG THAT BITES YOU REALLY NEED TO GET YOUR DOG INTO SOME HEAVY TRAINING FOR OBEDIENCE AND TEACH THAT DOG HOW TO PROPERLY RESPECT HIS OWNERS AND HOW TO PROPERLY RESPECT THOSE THAT ARE AROUND HIM
GYFESeYnL1M_12 0 WITH FIRM CONSISTENT TRAINING WITH YOUR ADULT DOG IF YOU TEACH HIM PROPER MANNERS AND PROPER OBEDIENCE YOU CAN AFFECTIVELY TEACH HIM TO STOP BITING
GYFESeYnL1M_13 0 IF YOU NEED MORE INFORMATION ON HOW TO TRAIN YOUR ADULT DOG NOT TO BITE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT US AT DOGBEHAVIORONLINE.COM
HIathOhxbIQ_1 0 ALRIGHT NOW LET'S LEARN HOW TO DO BATMAS WHILE LYING ON THE SIDE
HIathOhxbIQ_2 0 MAKE SURE YOU'RE ENGAGED
HIathOhxbIQ_3 0 SO THE HEAD IS RELAXED AND THE ARMPIT IS RELAXED THE SPINE IS LONG MAKE SURE YOUR HIPS ARE STACKED AND INHALE IN
HIathOhxbIQ_4 0 EXHALE RIBS GO DOWN
HIathOhxbIQ_5 0 STAYING ENGAGED BRING YOUR HANDS TO THE FRONT
HIathOhxbIQ_6 0 NOW WHEN YOU DO THE BATMAS TO THE FRONT YOU ARE GOING LIKE PARALLEL ALONG THE FLOOR TO FORTY FIVE OR MAYBE EVEN NINETY DEGREES DEPENDING ON YOUR LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY THROUGH YOUR HAMSTRINGS
HIathOhxbIQ_7 0 IT'S A QUICK MOVEMENT OUT SLIGHTLY SLOWER TO A CLOSE KEEPING YOUR LEGS LONG YOU ARE MOVING FROM THE HIP
HIathOhxbIQ_8 0 SO THE BATMAS TO THE FRONT WILL LOOK LIKE THIS
HIathOhxbIQ_9 0 OUT AND PRESS OUT AND PRESS
HIathOhxbIQ_10 0 NOW WHENEVER YOU MOVE ANYTHING IN A QUICK FASHION YOU ARE GOING TO BE WIGGLING THROUGH THE CENTER THERE SHOULD BE NO WIGGLING THOUGH IF YOU ARE ENGAGED PROPERLY
HIathOhxbIQ_11 0 YOU ARE SQUEEZING THROUGH THE FRONT SQUEEZING THROUGH THE BACK HAND IS IN FRONT OF YOU FOR SUPPORT
HIathOhxbIQ_12 0 STRETCH IT OUT CLOSE IT BACK
HIathOhxbIQ_13 0 STRETCH IT FORWARD AND CLOSE IT BACK KEEPING THE HIPS STACKED DON'T ROLL STAY ENGAGED AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE BREATHING
HIathOhxbIQ_14 0 AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO A BATMAS TO THE FRONT WHILE LYING ON YOUR SIDE
gftjEctPuKY_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO DO THE SECOND SIDE OF THAT VARIATION ON TWISTING CROW POSE
gftjEctPuKY_2 0 SO BRING UP THE RIGHT LEG
gftjEctPuKY_3 0 BRING YOUR HEEL UNDERNEATH THE HIP CROSS THE LEFT LEG OVER SO WE'RE READY FOR THE OTHER SIDE
gftjEctPuKY_4 0 AGAIN PLACING THE FINGERS WIDE HANDS TO THE FLOOR AND YOUR LEFT KNEE ON THE UPPER TRICEP BACK SIDE OF THE ARM OF THE RIGHT ARM
gftjEctPuKY_5 0 NOW I'M GOING TO LIFT THE HIPS BY TURNING THE BACK TOES UNDER AND NOW I AM BALANCING ON THE FEET MOSTLY SO I'M GOING TO SHIFT THE WEIGHT INTO THE ARMS AND AS I DO SO KEEP THE BEND IN THE ELBOWS HUG THE CENTER LINE PRESS THROUGH THE FINGER LIFT THE SHOULDERS AWAY FROM THE FLOOR AND THEN TURN
gftjEctPuKY_6 0 YOU CAN STAY HERE OR EXTEND THE LEGS
gftjEctPuKY_7 0 AND THEN COME BACK
gftjEctPuKY_8 0 SIT BACK ON THE HEELS AND TAKE A FEW DEEP BREATHS
hgGySE80h88_1 0 ONE OF THE THINGS I JUST WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHEN WERE JUST TALKING IN GENERAL ABOUT COLLECTING AND WERE TALKING RIGHT NOW SPECIFICALLY ABOUT COLLECTING RUBY FLASH
hgGySE80h88_2 0 A LOT OF THESE THINGS BECOME POPULAR FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS AND I CAN GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES
hgGySE80h88_3 0 I MEAN EVERYONE KNOWS MARTHA STEWART WHEN SHE HAD HER SHOW SHE WOULD GO ON AND SHE WOULD SHOW YOU SOME OF THE THINGS THAT SHE'D LIKES A LOT THAT ARE ANTIQUE
hgGySE80h88_4 0 ONE OF THE THINGS IN PARTICULAR COMES TO MIND WITH ME IS YELLOW WARE AND SHE DISPLAYS IT IN BACK OF HERE WHEN SHE'S TALKING ON HER SHOW AND DOING ANY COOKING
hgGySE80h88_5 0 YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF YELLOW WARE IT BECOMES SIMILAR TO PEOPLE PEOPLE WANT TO COLLECT IT IF MARTHA STEWART COLLECTS IT THEN IT MUST BE GOOD
hgGySE80h88_6 0 SO ANOTHER THING THAT COMES TO MIND IS FIRE KING WHICH IS THE GREEN DINNERWARE PRODUCED IN THE 1900'S THAT MARTHA STEWART SHOWS ALL THE TIME
hgGySE80h88_7 0 YOU CAN SEE SHE ACTUALLY REPRODUCED THIS FIRE KING AND BECAME VERY POPULAR SO IT RAISES THE PRICE ON THESE ITEMS WHEN THEY BECOME MORE IN DEMAND
hgGySE80h88_8 0 SO SOMETHING TO CONSIDER WHEN YOUR THINKING ABOUT COLLECTION IF YOUR TRYING TO DEFINE WHERE YOU WANT TO COLLECT I CAN TELL YOU JUST FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE JUST SEEING NOW TRANSFER WARE BROWN TRANSFER WARE IS VERY COLLECTIBLE RIGHT NOW AND ITS COMMANDING VERY HIGH PRICES
hgGySE80h88_9 0 AND THATS BECAUSE MARTHA STEWART MADE IT POPULAR SHE SHOWS THEM IN A LOT OF HER MAGAZINES AND TWENTY YEARS AGO IN MY EXPERIENCE BROWN TRANSFER WARE I HAD IN MY SHOW I COULDN'T SELL IT
hgGySE80h88_10 0 SO YOU CAN SEE JUST THE TIME FRAME WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND WHAT YOU COLLECT AND HOW MUCH YOUR GOING TO PAY FOR IT
hgGySE80h88_11 0 SOMETHING TO CONSIDER SO YOU CAN LOOK AT ALL THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF WHERE THESE TYPES OF COLLECTIBLES ARE SHOWN AND YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THEM ARE MORE POPULAR NOW THAN OTHERS
hgGySE80h88_12 0 AND THOSE PIECES ARE MORE POPULAR AT THIS TIME PERIOD ARE GOING TO COST MORE MONEY SO THAT'S A CONSIDERATION WHEN THINKING ABOUT COLLECTING SOMETHING
hgGySE80h88_13 0 ALSO TO CONSIDER HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE AVAILABLE ACCESSIBLE TO GO OUT THERE AND COLLECT SO JUST SOME GENERAL THINGS ABOUT COLLECTING AND RUBY GLASS FALLS INTO THE SAME CATOGORY
hgGySE80h88_14 0 I MEAN IT HAS IT POPULARITY IN THE LATE 1800'S EARLY 1920'S AND PEOPLE LOVED TO COLLECT RUBY WHETHER I FEEL THIS HAS MORE ROOM IN VALUE SO YOUR PAYING A FAIRLY REASONABLE PRICE IN DOWN THE ROAD HOPEFULLY YOUR VALUE WILL INCREASE
hgGySE80h88_15 0 SO SOMETHING TO CONSIDER WHEN YOUR THINKING ABOUT COLLECTING ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR BUT WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS RUBY FLASH
gD4W6EX4UgU_2 0 THIS IS JOSIAH OWEN WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
gD4W6EX4UgU_3 0 THE NEXT THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE OUR PEANUTS
gD4W6EX4UgU_4 0 A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME YOU WANT TO POUR THEM ON THE TABLE
gD4W6EX4UgU_5 0 TAKE THE FLAT PART OF OUR BLADE AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO PRESS DOWN
gD4W6EX4UgU_6 0 WE'RE GOING TO GRIND OUR PEANUTS DOWN SO WHEN WE BITE INTO OUR COOKIES WE DON'T GET A BIG CHUNK OF PEANUT
gD4W6EX4UgU_7 0 YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM A QUICK SMASH AND YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH AND GET THE REST OF THE BIG PIECES
gD4W6EX4UgU_8 0 IF YOU WERE TO DO THIS OFF THE BAT THE PEANUTS WOULD ROLL AROUND AND IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO CHOP THEM UP
gD4W6EX4UgU_9 0 IF YOU WANT TO YOU CAN ALSO USE CASHEWS OR ALMONDS
gD4W6EX4UgU_10 0 IT'S UP TO YOU BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST USING PEANUTS
gD4W6EX4UgU_11 0 WHAT I'VE ACTUALLY DONE IS I BOUGHT A BIG TIN OF MIXED NUTS AND EVERYBODY LIKES TO PICK THROUGH THOSE SO THESE ARE THE LEFTOVER PEANUTS FROM THAT
gD4W6EX4UgU_12 0 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS AND PUT THIS IN THE BOWL WITH OUR CHOCOLATE SINCE IT'S ALL GOING TO THE SAME PLACE ANYWAY
gD4W6EX4UgU_13 0 TAKE ANOTHER GROUP OF PEANUTS AND DO THE EXACT SAME THING
gREt_t5ACe8_1 0 MAYBE YOU'RE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE AN INSTRUMENT OLDER THAN 1930 THIS ONE HAPPENS TO BE ABOUT 1830
gREt_t5ACe8_2 0 THERE IS NO TRUSS ROD IN AN INSTRUMENT OLDER THAN 1930 IT'S A RELATIVELY MODERN INVENTION
gREt_t5ACe8_3 0 BUT I BROUGHT THIS ONE PRIMARILY SO THAT YOU COULD SEE THE ISSUE OF A WARP
gREt_t5ACe8_4 0 WE TALKED ABOUT A BOW A BOW GOES THIS WAY BUT A WARP IS SOMETHING THAT GOES THIS WAY
gREt_t5ACe8_5 0 AND YOU CAN SEE LOOKING AT THIS INSTRUMENT FROM THE END THAT THERE IS A PRETTY NASTY TWIST IN THIS NECK
gREt_t5ACe8_6 0 MUCH MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO DO GOES BEYOND THE SCOPE OF A SETUP IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THAT KIND OF AN ISSUE
gREt_t5ACe8_7 0 BASICALLY WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IN A CASE LIKE THIS AND THIS IS NOT A JOB FOR THE HOME AMATEUR TO DO WOULD BE TO REMOVE ALL THE FRETS SAND THE FRETBOARD LEVEL PUT THE FRETS BACK IN
G6sHYJym78c_1 0 FIRST OF ALL THIS PARTICULAR BOAT HAS A LITTLE FLIPPED UP PANEL HERE
G6sHYJym78c_2 0 YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THIS SIDE OF THE HATCH COVER IS BEVELED AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT'S PUT BACK IN SO THAT THE BEVEL IS POINTING DOWN ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOAT OR OUTSIDE OF THE CABIN
G6sHYJym78c_3 0 THAT WAY WATER RUNS DOWN HERE AND IT FLOWS OUTSIDE THE BOAT AS OPPOSED TO FLOWING INSIDE THE BOAT
G6sHYJym78c_4 0 SO WE WILL PUT THIS ON THERE
G6sHYJym78c_5 0 USUALLY WHEN YOU GET DONE YOU WILL HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA IF IT'S RIGHT BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET READY TO LOCK IT IT WON'T LOCK
G6sHYJym78c_6 0 SOME BOATS CAN BE RATHER COMPLEX
G6sHYJym78c_7 0 THE LITTLE HATCH COVERS
G6sHYJym78c_8 0 THE VIDEO BUT EVEN THESE LITTLE BREATHER HOLES ARE POINTED UP SO THAT ANY WATER THAT HITS THERE FLOWS DOWN
gAtWnQpBYUQ_1 0 HI I'M EMILY LAREW AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT OVER THE TOPS
gAtWnQpBYUQ_2 0 IN OUR PREVIOUS CLIP WE HAVE LEARNED FRONT TOGETHER BACK TOGETHER BRUSH HEEL TOE WHICH IS A PREPARATION FOR OVER THE TOPS
gAtWnQpBYUQ_3 0 SO LET'S PUT THAT TOGETHER AND THEN FIGURE OUT HOW DO THOSE OVER THE TOPS
gAtWnQpBYUQ_4 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO START OUR PREPARATION GOES FRONT TOGETHER BACK TOGETHER BRUSH HEEL TOE
gAtWnQpBYUQ_5 0 AGAIN FRONT TOGETHER BACK TOGETHER BRUSH HEEL TOE
gAtWnQpBYUQ_6 0 NOW A LOT OF MY STUDENTS FIND THIS REALLY TRICKY OKAY
gAtWnQpBYUQ_7 0 BUT GOING OVER THE TOP ALL YOU'RE GOING TO DO LET ME TURN TO THE FRONT FOR YOU IS YOU'RE GOING TO JUMP YOUR LEFT FOOT THROUGH AND OVER YOUR RIGHT FOOT
gAtWnQpBYUQ_8 0 SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS WHEN YOU DO TOE YOU'RE GOING TO PICK UP YOUR FOOT
gAtWnQpBYUQ_9 0 BUT FOR RIGHT NOW LET'S JUST TRY IT WITH THE TOE WE'RE CHEATING SO REMEMBER WHEN WE STOP CHEATING YOU CAN'T DO THIS ANY MORE OKAY
gAtWnQpBYUQ_10 0 SO TOE ON THE FLOOR YOU'RE GOING TO JUMP OVER YOUR RIGHT FOOT OKAY AND LAND IN FRONT OF IT
gAtWnQpBYUQ_11 0 SO YOUR RIGHT LEG WAS IN THE FRONT NOW MY LEFT LEG IS IN FRONT
gAtWnQpBYUQ_12 0 OKAY SO LET'S TRY IT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH OUR TOE I WANT YOU TO PICK IT UP YOU'RE JUST GOING TO JUMP DON'T CHEAT IT BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS GO LIKE THIS AND THAT WAS NOT OVER THE TOP THAT WAS ACROSS THE SIDE
gAtWnQpBYUQ_13 0 SO WITH OUR RIGHT FOOT OVER I WANT YOU TO JUMP OVER THE TOP GOOD
gAtWnQpBYUQ_14 0 SO LET'S TRY FRONT TOGETHER BACK TOGETHER BRUSH HEEL TOE OVER THE TOP
gAtWnQpBYUQ_15 0 FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT FRONT TOGETHER BACK TOGETHER BRUSH HEEL TOE OVER THE TOP WOO HOO LET'S TRY IT ONE MORE TIME
gAtWnQpBYUQ_16 0 SIX SEVEN THAT'S WHERE YOU WANT TO BE CAREFUL OF BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T JUMP HIGH ENOUGH YOU'RE GOING TO TRIP OVER YOUR FEET AND THAT WOULD BE A CATASTROPHE
gAtWnQpBYUQ_17 0 SO MAKE SURE YOU JUMP HIGH ENOUGH
gAtWnQpBYUQ_18 0 SIX SEVEN AND FRONT TOGETHER BACK TOGETHER BRUSH HEEL TOE OVER THE TOP
gAtWnQpBYUQ_19 0 AND THAT IS A GOOD LANDING
gAtWnQpBYUQ_20 0 SO YOU HAD A BAD ONE AND A GOOD EXAMPLE SO MAKE SURE YOU REALLY DO BEND YOUR KNEES JUMP OVER THAT FOOT DON'T LET IT GET CAUGHT
grMN2HA7pkE_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO COVER JACKING THE VEHICLE

GMdzELsnccA_11 0 ONE TWO THREE ONE TWO THREE ONE TWO THREE AND WE CAN GET EVEN FASTER AS WE GO ALONG AND AS YOU PROGRESS
GgmaNj_ya4k_1 0 ALRIGHT WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS THE HOSING FOR OUR FLUVAL
GgmaNj_ya4k_2 0 THIS IS A SPECIAL HOSING THAT COMES WITH THE FLUVAL THOUGH TO BE FAIR IF THIS GETS DAMAGED OR SOMETHING YOU CAN JUST GO TO LIKE LOWE'S OR ANY OTHER HARDWARE STORE AND BUY ANY KIND OF RUBBER TUBING OR I'M SORRY PBC TUBING
GgmaNj_ya4k_3 0 BUT THIS GUY IS GOING TO STICK RIGHT INTO IT STICKS RIGHT OVER THAT FLOW CONTROL PART THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OK
GgmaNj_ya4k_4 0 THEY COME IN ONE PIECE HERE
GgmaNj_ya4k_5 0 YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CUT IT IN HALF TO USE YOUR TUBES
GgmaNj_ya4k_6 0 AND THEN YOU HAVE THESE PIECES THESE ARE LITTLE CURVED PIECES THAT WILL HOLD THE TUBING IN TACT OVER THE CORNER OF THE LIP OF THE TANK SEE HOW IT'S GOT A LIP THERE
GgmaNj_ya4k_7 0 YOUR TUBING GOES IN THERE AND SHOOTS IT DOWN
GgmaNj_ya4k_8 0 AND THEN YOU HAVE YOUR THIS IS YOUR INFLOW FOR THE TUBING
GgmaNj_ya4k_9 0 THIS WILL CONNECT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF YOUR TUBE
GgmaNj_ya4k_10 0 THIS IS WHERE THE WATER FLOWS INTO THE FLUVAL
GgmaNj_ya4k_11 0 SEE HOW IT'S GOT THIS LITTLE GRATE
GgmaNj_ya4k_12 0 WATER FLOWS IN THERE OK UP THE TUBE UP YOUR PIPING INTO THE FLUVAL
GgmaNj_ya4k_13 0 THIS IS YOUR OUTFLOW RIGHT HERE
GgmaNj_ya4k_14 0 AND IT COMES OUT THE OTHER DIRECTION
GgmaNj_ya4k_15 0 YOU WANT THIS TO BE RELATIVELY THE SAME HEIGHT
GgmaNj_ya4k_16 0 SO WE'RE PUTTING IT IN YOUR AQUARIUM
GgmaNj_ya4k_17 0 SAME HEIGHT AS THE WATER LEVEL THE OUTFLOW TUBING
GgmaNj_ya4k_18 0 THE INFLOW TUBE SHOULD GO DOWN RELATIVELY TOWARDS THE BOTTOM
GgmaNj_ya4k_19 0 YOU DON'T WANT IT ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM BUT CLOSE TO IT
GgmaNj_ya4k_20 0 OK WHAT THAT IS GOING TO DO IS IT'S GOING TO CREATE AGITATION ON THE WATER LEVEL AND STOP IT FROM GETTING A FILM AND IT'S GOING TO KEEP YOUR CLEAN WATER FROM NOT ENTERING RIGHT BACK INTO YOUR FLUVAL
GINnMzLQ5Sc_1 0 HI THIS IS YOLANDA VANVEEN FROM VANVEENBULBS.COM
GINnMzLQ5Sc_2 0 AND IN THIS SERIES WE'RE LEARNING HOW TO IDENTIFY SPRING BLOOMING FLOWER BULBS
GINnMzLQ5Sc_3 0 AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE OF MY FAVORITE TULIPS IN MY YARD CALLED GREENLAND
GINnMzLQ5Sc_4 0 SO GREENLAND IS SOMETIMES SPELLED G-R-O-E-N-L-A-N-D FOR GROENLAND THE DUTCH PRONUNCIATION
GINnMzLQ5Sc_5 0 SO IN SOME CATALOGS YOU'LL FIND IT SPELLED THE DUTCH WAY
GINnMzLQ5Sc_6 0 BUT IN AMERICA WE CALL IT GREENLAND
GINnMzLQ5Sc_7 0 AND IT'S EASY TO IDENTIFY BECAUSE IT'S SO UNUSUAL
GINnMzLQ5Sc_8 0 IT HAS A GREEN STRIPE WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CREAM AND THEN PINK EDGES
GINnMzLQ5Sc_9 0 AND WE CALL IT THE WATERMELON TULIP BECAUSE IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A WATERMELON
GINnMzLQ5Sc_10 0 AND WHEN IT'S BRIGHT SUNNY DAY A LOT OF TIMES IT WILL EVEN APPEAR TO BE DARKER PINK
GINnMzLQ5Sc_11 0 AND BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF SUN THIS YEAR IN THE SPRING IT SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE SOFTER PINK
GINnMzLQ5Sc_12 0 BECAUSE IN YEARS PAST IT'S BEEN A MUCH DARKER PINK
GINnMzLQ5Sc_13 0 IT'S A LITTLE BIT TALLER DAFFODIL THAN A LOT OF MY OTHERS
GINnMzLQ5Sc_14 0 AND IT'S JUST A BEAUTIFUL LONG LASTING DAFFODIL THAT NO TWO LOOK THE SAME
GINnMzLQ5Sc_15 0 AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE SOMEONE JUST PAINTED THE GREEN STRIPES ON IT
GINnMzLQ5Sc_16 0 TWO COLORED FLOWERS ARE REALLY POPULAR THESE DAYS AND THIS IS EVEN A BETTER BONUS
GINnMzLQ5Sc_17 0 YOU HAVE THREE COLORS BECAUSE YOU GOT GREEN CREAM AND PINK
GINnMzLQ5Sc_18 0 IT WOULD BE THE HIGHLIGHT OF YOUR YARD IF YOU HAD IT
GINnMzLQ5Sc_19 0 NEXT WE'LL TALK ABOUT ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL TULIP BURGUNDY LACE
G-BbQihTk5k_1 0 SO THE LAST THING THAT YOU WANT TO DO WHENEVER FINISHING A MAKEUP APPLICATION IS YOU WANT TO CLEAN YOUR BRUSHES
G-BbQihTk5k_2 0 IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO REALLY TAKE CARE OF YOUR BRUSHES BECAUSE THEY LAST LONGER AND BRUSHES CAN BE A BIG INVESTMENT SO YOU WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THEM FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE
G-BbQihTk5k_3 0 SO WHAT YOU'LL NEED TO GET IS A BRUSH CLEANSER AND A PAPER TOWEL AND YOU CAN BUY BRUSH CLEANSER WITH ALMOST ANY MAKEUP BRAND
G-BbQihTk5k_4 0 AND JUST TAKE THE BRUSH CLEANSER AND SPRAY IT ONTO THE PAPER TOWEL AND THEN YOU TAKE YOUR BRUSH AND WIPE IT BACK AND FORTH UNTIL IT REMOVES ALL THE COLOR
G-BbQihTk5k_5 0 AND THEN IT'S A GOOD IDEA ALSO ABOUT ONCE A MONTH TO SHAMPOO AND CONDITION YOUR BRUSHES
G-BbQihTk5k_6 0 YOU WANT TO USE WARM WATER AND A LITTLE TINY BIT OF SHAMPOO AND THEN RINSE THAT OUT AND THEN USE A LITTLE TINY BIT OF CONDITIONER AND THEN RINSE IT AND AFTER YOU RINSE IT DRY IT FLAT
G-BbQihTk5k_7 0 YOU WANT TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR BRUSHES LIKE YOU WOULD TAKE CARE OF YOUR HAIR AND THEY'LL LAST A LOT LONGER
G-BbQihTk5k_8 0 SO THAT IS HOW YOU CONDITION YOUR BRUSHES
gYTm2ca7huo_1 0 ANOTHER GOOD WAY TO ACHIEVE A DRIPPING LIKE EFFECT WITH GLAZE IS TO PUT IT IN A KETCHUP OR MUSTARD BOTTLE
gYTm2ca7huo_2 0 I'VE GOT SOME THAT'S ALREADY PREPARED
gYTm2ca7huo_3 0 SHAKE IT UP MAKE SURE IT'S MIXED REALLY WELL
gYTm2ca7huo_4 0 THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME STUFF THAT COMES OUT OF THE BUCKETS
gYTm2ca7huo_5 0 I'VE JUST MADE SURE TO MIX SOME UP AND PUT IT IN A BOTTLE
gYTm2ca7huo_6 0 THIS IS ONE THAT I FREQUENTLY USE TO DRIP WITH
gYTm2ca7huo_7 0 I JUST SQUEEZED OUT A LITTLE BIT TO MAKE SURE I DIDN'T HAVE A CLOG IN THE TIP OF MY BOTTLE
gYTm2ca7huo_8 0 NOW I'VE GOT ON THE SAME BANDING WHEEL THAT I WAS USING WHEN I WAS WAXING
gYTm2ca7huo_9 0 AND I LIKE TO HAVE A DRIP THAT KIND OF VARIES ALL THE WAY AROUND
gYTm2ca7huo_10 0 SO I'M GOING TO JUST GENTLY SQUEEZE OVER AND OVER AS I SPIN THIS BANDING WHEEL
gYTm2ca7huo_11 0 NOW I'M JUST I'M MAKING LITTLE PUMPS
gYTm2ca7huo_12 0 YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IT COME AROUND IN A SECOND MAKING LITTLE PUMPS WITH MY HAND SO THAT I'M GETTING A REALLY VARIED DRIP LINE
gYTm2ca7huo_13 0 AND I ACTUALLY LIKE TO INTENSIFY THAT DRIP SO WHAT I DO IS I TAKE THE WHOLE POT AND I HIT IT JUST A LITTLE BIT
gYTm2ca7huo_14 0 SOME OF IT WILL DRIP OFF BUT IT'LL ELONGATE THOSE DRIPS AND MAKE THEM JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE DRAMATIC IN THE END
Gc0p6pmb6oM_1 0 GENERALLY SPEAKING THE EAR IS GOING TO HAVE A SHAPE AS WE'VE LOOK AT THE OTHER THING IT'S GENERALLY HALF A CIRCLE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_2 0 IT'S SMOOTH HERE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_3 0 LEVEL WITH THE FRONT OF THE FACE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_4 0 IT STICKS OUT TOWARD THE BACK
Gc0p6pmb6oM_5 0 THE BASIC SHAPE OF THE EAR IS PRETTY SIMPLE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_6 0 IT'S NOT SOMETHING TO BE AFRAID OF
Gc0p6pmb6oM_7 0 EXCUSE THE MULTIPLE DRAWINGS
Gc0p6pmb6oM_8 0 THERE'S A LITTLE LIP HERE AND THAT LITTLE FRONT PART
Gc0p6pmb6oM_9 0 THEN THIS IS A BIG SWIRL AND IN THAT SWIRL THERE IS TYPICALLY A SECOND AREA THAT'S KIND OF A SWIRL
Gc0p6pmb6oM_10 0 IT'S GOT A SHAPE LIKE THAT
Gc0p6pmb6oM_11 0 AND THEN THIS IS THE ACTUAL AREA THAT IS THE DEEPEST WHICH IS WHERE SOUND GOES IN
Gc0p6pmb6oM_12 0 THAT'S THE BASIC SHAPE OF A COMMON EAR AND IF YOU JUST GENERALLY PUT THAT IN THERE MOST PEOPLE WILL ACCEPT IT IN A SCULPTURE AS SOMETHING THAT'S BELIEVABLE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_13 0 NOW I'M GOING TO SWITCH TO MY OTHER MODEL BECAUSE I'VE REFINED THIS EAR A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND YOU CAN SEE THE BASIC SHAPE COMPARED TO THIS WHICH HASN'T BEEN SHAPED YET BUT IT FOLLOWS THE SAME BASIC PATTERN
Gc0p6pmb6oM_14 0 WITH THE OUT LIP BACK HERE THE INNER LIP HERE AND THIS LITTLE AREA HERE AND THE DEEP AREA INSIDE WHICH IS RIGHT IN THERE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_15 0 NOW BECAUSE THIS HAS TO BE CAST I'M NOT GOING TO CARVE THIS DEEP BECAUSE THAT WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS WHEN I MOLD IT SO I'M JUST GOING TO REPRESENT IT WITH THIS SIMPLE APPROACH
Gc0p6pmb6oM_16 0 JUST LIKE IT IS WITH JUST THIS THE SUGGESTION OF THIS AND THIS OUTER LIP REPRESENTING THE ENTIRE SHAPE OF THE EAR
Gc0p6pmb6oM_17 0 GOT THERE THE SAME WAY I DID EVERYTHING ELSE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_18 0 JUST SIMPLY CARVING AWAY WITH MY LITTLE KNIFE AND APPLYING HEAT WHEN NECESSARY
GCb5gn26O2k_1 0 OKAY WHEN YOU REPLACE YOUR AIR FILTER GENERALLY IF YOU HAVE THE STOCK AIR FILTER BOX IN THE CAR THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME SAND AND LEAVES AND WHATEVER WHAT HAVE YOU INSIDE OF THIS BOX
GCb5gn26O2k_2 0 SO YOU KIND OF YOU CAN TAKE A VACUUM CLEANER AND VACUUM ALL OF THE LOOSE MATERIAL OUT SO YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FILTER IS PROPERLY CLEAN WHEN YOU PUT IT BACK IN
GCb5gn26O2k_3 0 AND WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WHEN YOU PUT THE YOUR FILTER BACK ON YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ALL YOUR COMPONENTS IN THE RIGHT PLACE
GCb5gn26O2k_4 0 AND YOU JUST GENERALLY IN THE STOCK FILTER YOU JUST GENERALLY PUT THE FILTER BACK IN AND CLAMP THE TOP OF THE BOX BACK ON
GCb5gn26O2k_5 0 BUT WITH THIS APPLICATION YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF CLAMPS YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH
GCb5gn26O2k_6 0 SO YOU JUST MAKE SURE YOU GET EVERYTHING BACK PROPERLY SO IT'S NOT IN THE WAY OF ANYTHING ELSE IN THE VEHICLE
GCb5gn26O2k_7 0 AND JUST TIGHTEN IT BACK DOWN
GCb5gn26O2k_8 0 AND THAT IS HOW YOU REPLACE YOUR AIR FILTER
GsqmkvYlv7Y_1 0 WELCOME TO EXPERT VILLAGE
GsqmkvYlv7Y_2 0 MY NAME IS HUGH MURPHY WITH SURF THE SKY PARAGLIDING
GsqmkvYlv7Y_3 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'LL TALK ABOUT WEATHER THAT WE WANT TO FLY IN
GsqmkvYlv7Y_4 0 SINCE WE ARE THE SMALLEST CRAFT IN AVIATION WE ARE VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE MICRO-CLIMATES OF WINDS
GsqmkvYlv7Y_5 0 FOR INSTANCE WEATHER CAN BE DIFFERENT ON ONE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN THAN ON THE OTHER BUT WITH OUR MOTOR WE CAN FLY INTO BOTH
GsqmkvYlv7Y_6 0 ONE EXCELLENT SOURCE IS THE INTERNET FOR WEATHER AND WEATHER FORECASTING
GsqmkvYlv7Y_7 0 AGAIN THE PRIORITY BEING UNDERSTANDING THE WEATHER EXACTLY WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO FLY BECAUSE OF THESE MICRO-CLIMATES
GsqmkvYlv7Y_8 0 ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS ABOUT WEATHER IS ACTUALLY PRINTED BY THE FAA
GsqmkvYlv7Y_9 0 AND IT TEACHES YOU HOW TO UNDERSTAND BOTH THE LARGER WEATHER PATTERNS AND THEN THE SMALL LOCAL PATTERNS
GsqmkvYlv7Y_10 0 SO WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CONCEPT ALSO OF THE WIND PARAMETER
GsqmkvYlv7Y_11 0 MOST PILOTS HAVE A FUN ZONE WHERE THEY CAN REALLY ENJOY WINDS UP TO SAY NINE MILES AN HOUR AND THEY MIGHT HAVE THE SKILLS TO SURVIVE ANOTHER FIVE MILES AN HOUR UP TO AS MUCH AS FIFTEEN BUT IT'S NOT FUN
GsqmkvYlv7Y_12 0 SO WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO STAY IN THE FUN ZONE OF YOUR WIND SPEED
GsqmkvYlv7Y_13 0 HAVE GOOD SKILLS TO DO A FORWARD LAUNCH IN ZERO WINDS
GsqmkvYlv7Y_14 0 HAVE REVERSE LAUNCH SKILLS TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE UP TO A SLIGHT SOARING BREEZE OF UP TO TEN TO TWELVE MILES AN HOUR

gk4T55dEXyQ_9 0 AGAIN LIKE I WAS SAYING EARLIER IT'S A GREAT WAY TO USE AN INEXPENSIVE MOUTHWASH AND IT'S BETTER THAN ANY MOUTHWASH ON THE MARKET
gk4T55dEXyQ_10 0 MOST MOUTHWASHES LAST ONLY ABOUT SEVEN EIGHT MINUTES AND THEY'RE DONE
gk4T55dEXyQ_11 0 THIS WILL LAST A HALF AN HOUR TO AN HOUR DEPENDING ON AND YOU INGEST IT TOO SO WHAT'S GOOD IS IF YOU BURP YOU'RE GOING TO BURP PARSLEY AND IT'S A GREAT WAY TO SAVE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON MOUTHWASH

hb3_mYgx7co_1 0 OKAY BEFORE WE START FROSTING OUR BEAR WE WANT TO GET RID OF ANY CRUMBS THAT ARE AROUND ON THE SERVING TRAY AND AROUND THE CAKE
hb3_mYgx7co_2 0 SO YOU CAN REALLY JUST TAKE A NAPKIN AND BRUSH THAT OFF
hb3_mYgx7co_3 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET THESE CRUMBS OFF SO THAT THEY DON'T GET MIXED INTO THE FROSTING WHILE YOU'RE DECORATING
hb3_mYgx7co_4 0 SO YOU CAN JUST BRUSH IT OFF LIKE THAT AND THEN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR WORK SURFACE IS ALL CLEAR OF CRUMBS
hb3_mYgx7co_5 0 WE'LL BEGIN OUR FROSTING WITH THE SIDE OF THE CAKE AND THE KEY HERE IS TO USE A LOT OF FROSTING
hb3_mYgx7co_6 0 YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE OFF FROSTING AFTER YOU'RE FINISHED COVERING THE CAKE
hb3_mYgx7co_7 0 YOU WANT TO USE A LOT OF FROSTING TO AVOID GETTING CRUMBS IN YOUR FROSTING
hb3_mYgx7co_8 0 SO WE'LL START HERE AT THE EAR AND TAKE A GOOD DOLLOP OF FROSTING AND JUST START BY JUST SPREADING THAT ON
hb3_mYgx7co_9 0 NOW DON'T WORRY ABOUT GETTING THIS BIG CLUMP UP HERE ALONG THE EDGE
hb3_mYgx7co_10 0 WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT LATER
hb3_mYgx7co_11 0 THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE COVER THE SIDES AND YOU DON'T GET ALL THE CRUMBS IN THERE
hb3_mYgx7co_12 0 NOW TAKE ANOTHER LARGE DOLLOP OF FROSTING AND REMEMBER ALWAYS TO FROST ON TOP OF FROSTING
hb3_mYgx7co_13 0 SO INSTEAD OF STARTING HERE WHERE YOU ENDED YOU WANT TO START A LITTLE BIT FURTHER UP ON TOP OF FROSTING AND CONTINUE SPREADING ALONG THE SIDE FOLLOWING THE CONTOUR OF OUR BEAR
hb3_mYgx7co_14 0 ALWAYS STARTING A LITTLE BIT BACK WE'VE ALREADY FROSTED USING A LOT OF FROSTING AND WORK YOUR WAY AROUND THE CAKE'S SIDE SPREADING THAT FROSTING DOWN
hb3_mYgx7co_15 0 AND NOT WORRYING ABOUT IT BEING GLOBBY UP HERE
hb3_mYgx7co_16 0 WE'RE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT COVERING THE SIDE AND THEN AFTER WE'LL GO AROUND AND SMOOTH IT OUT
hb3_mYgx7co_17 0 I'VE GONE AROUND THE CAKE AND I'M COMING UP HERE BACK AROUND THE EARS AND SPREADING ON THAT FROSTING
hb3_mYgx7co_18 0 SEE HOW I MOVE THE SPATULA FOLLOWING THE CONTOURS OF THE CAKE AND PUTTING ON PLENTY OF ICING OR FROSTING COMING AROUND
hb3_mYgx7co_19 0 NOW WHEN YOU MOVE YOUR SPATULA BACK AND FORTH TO SMOOTH THE ICING ON THE SIDE YOU DO SORT OF A EDGE-TO-EDGE MOVE
hb3_mYgx7co_20 0 THIS EDGE AND THEN BACK TO THAT EDGE
hb3_mYgx7co_21 0 AND GO AND SMOOTH AROUND THE CAKE
hb3_mYgx7co_22 0 NOW AT THIS POINT YOU CAN JUST CHECK ANY OF THE EDGES THAT AREN'T SO SMOOTH
hb3_mYgx7co_23 0 YOU CAN CHECK ALL THE EDGES
hb3_mYgx7co_24 0 SEE I HAVE A NICE RIB OF FROSTING COMING UP ON THE SIDE PLENTY OF FROSTING
hb3_mYgx7co_25 0 AND THE CAKE IS SHAPED NICELY LIKE A BEAR
hb3_mYgx7co_26 0 NEXT WE'RE GOING TO FROST THE TOP OF THE CAKE
_Gfw1oLtz04_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO CHOOSE A PROFESSIONAL MASSAGE THERAPIST FOR YOUR CANINE
_Gfw1oLtz04_2 0 NOW EVERY STATE IS DIFFERENT MOST STATES DON'T HAVE ANY LAWS OR REGULATIONS WHICH MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT SCARY
_Gfw1oLtz04_3 0 SO IT'S YOUR JOB TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE CHOOSING THE RIGHT PERSON TO GET THEIR HANDS ON YOUR CANINE
_Gfw1oLtz04_4 0 A LOT OF GROOMERS OFFER DOG MASSAGE AS AN ADDED BONUS BUT THEY'VE NEVER TAKEN A CLASS IN CANINE MASSAGE
_Gfw1oLtz04_5 0 AND THIS IS A LITTLE BIT SCARY BECAUSE ANYBODY CAN SAY THEY DO DOG MASSAGE
_Gfw1oLtz04_6 0 YOU WANT TO LOOK INTO THEIR QUALIFICATIONS
_Gfw1oLtz04_7 0 YOU WANT TO ASK THEM WHAT SCHOOLS THEY WENT TO
_Gfw1oLtz04_8 0 YOU WANT TO SEE IF THEY'VE BEEN INSURED IF THEY HAVE ANY OTHER QUALIFICATIONS OTHER THAN A HOME COURSE FOR DOG MASSAGE
_Gfw1oLtz04_9 0 SOMEONE WHO HAS ACTUALLY TAKEN THE TIME TO GO THE STATE AND LEARN DOG MASSAGE IS GOING TO HAVE A BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF THE DOG'S MUSCLES OF SPECIFIC AILMENTS
_Gfw1oLtz04_10 0 YOU WANT TO TELL THEM WHAT MEDICATIONS YOUR DOG MAY BE TAKING AND THEY SHOULD KNOW WHAT THESE MEDICATIONS DO FOR THE DOG TO KNOW IF IT'S A CONTRAINDICATION
_Gfw1oLtz04_11 0 SO THE MORE CLASSES THEY'VE TAKEN THE MORE COURSES THEY'VE PHYSICALLY GONE TO THE BETTER THEIR QUALIFICATIONS
GkP-dY18p_w_1 0 IN THIS SEQUENCE WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING ON THE LOTUS SWEEP KICK WHICH SHOWS UP AT VERY END SEQUENCE IN THE YANG STYLE LONG FORM
GkP-dY18p_w_2 0 IT COMES FROM THE CROSS PALM STRIKE THE THROAT
GkP-dY18p_w_3 0 NOW WHAT WE WANT TO DO HERE IS WE WANT TO LET BOTH HANDS COME UP AND TURN TO THE CORNER
GkP-dY18p_w_4 0 A COMMON ERROR HERE IS TO TURN TOO FAR
GkP-dY18p_w_5 0 WE LET BOTH HANDS COME UP
GkP-dY18p_w_6 0 TURN TO THE CORNER
GkP-dY18p_w_7 0 SINKING INTO THE LEG
GkP-dY18p_w_8 0 NOW WE KEEP THE HANDS AT THAT CORNER BUT I SHIFT MY WEIGHT AND TURN MY WAIST
GkP-dY18p_w_9 0 SO THAT MY WAIST MY HIPS ARE FACING IN THIS DIRECTION
GkP-dY18p_w_10 0 MY ARMS ARE HERE
GkP-dY18p_w_11 0 IT IS KIND OF LIKE IT ALWAYS REMINDS ME OF HEISMAN TROPHY TYPE OF A THING
GkP-dY18p_w_12 0 THEN I WANT TO BRING MY KNEE UP IN THIS DIRECTION
GkP-dY18p_w_13 0 SO THE HANDS ARE HERE
GkP-dY18p_w_14 0 THE KNEE IS HERE
GkP-dY18p_w_15 0 SO I CAME AROUND
GkP-dY18p_w_17 0 BRING THE KNEE UP
GkP-dY18p_w_18 0 AND THEN WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO IS EXTEND THE LEG OUT
GkP-dY18p_w_19 0 AS THE LEG COMES ACROSS THE HANDS ARE GOING TO MEET THE LEG AND TURN TO THE CORNER
GkP-dY18p_w_20 0 SO THE FULL POSTURE OF THIS LOOKS LIKE THIS
GkP-dY18p_w_21 0 AND YOU WANT TO IF YOU CAN KICK YOUR HAND
GkP-dY18p_w_22 0 BUT YOU DO NOT WANT TO BRING YOUR HANDS TO YOUR LEG
GkP-dY18p_w_23 0 YOU JUST WANT TO LET THEM MEET IN THE MIDDLE
GkP-dY18p_w_24 0 SO YOU ARE HERE
GkP-dY18p_w_25 0 SEE HOW THEY MET IN THE MIDDLE
GkP-dY18p_w_26 0 RIGHT THERE IS WHERE WE WANT THEM TO MEET AS OPPOSED TO WAY OVER HERE
GkP-dY18p_w_27 0 IF YOU CAN ONLY KICK LOW TOTALLY APPROPRIATE
GbdXlEMp8gg_2 0 AND THEN IN THIS STEP WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO ATTACH OUR THREE CARD SET BASES
GbdXlEMp8gg_3 0 THAT WE HAVE ALREADY CUT AND SCORED
GbdXlEMp8gg_4 0 AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THEM ON AN ANGLE POINTS DOWN
GbdXlEMp8gg_5 0 AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TWO UNDERNEATH A TOP ONE
GbdXlEMp8gg_6 0 BASICALLY THE IDEA WHAT IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE
GbdXlEMp8gg_7 0 SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND I'LL TAKE THAT ONE AWAY
GbdXlEMp8gg_8 0 AND NORMALLY I'M VERY SPARING WITH MY GLUE
GbdXlEMp8gg_9 0 I LIKE TO BE STINGY WITH IT
GbdXlEMp8gg_10 0 BUT SINCE WE'RE GOING TO ATTACH THESE TO A BASE
GbdXlEMp8gg_11 0 IT'S GOING TO HAVE QUITE A FEW UNBENTS AND FOLDS
GbdXlEMp8gg_12 0 AND OPENS AND RECLOSES
GbdXlEMp8gg_13 0 YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO APPLY A LOT OF GLUE HERE
GbdXlEMp8gg_14 0 SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO IT ON ONE CORNER
GbdXlEMp8gg_15 0 AND THEN I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO IT ON ANOTHER CORNER
GbdXlEMp8gg_16 0 OR A SQUARE I SHOULD SAY
GbdXlEMp8gg_18 0 NOW THAT WE HAVE THAT
GbdXlEMp8gg_19 0 I'M GOING TO APPLY THE TOP ONE DIRECTLY ON THE SQUARE LINES
GbdXlEMp8gg_20 0 ALRIGHT NOW THAT WE ADDED ONE SIDE OF THE CORNER
GbdXlEMp8gg_21 0 I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND ADD THE SECOND SIDE
GbdXlEMp8gg_22 0 AND ONCE AGAIN YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT RIGHT ALONG THE SCORE LINES
GbdXlEMp8gg_23 0 ALRIGHT AND JUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD SECURE BOND OVER THERE
GbdXlEMp8gg_24 0 ALRIGHT AND THEN IN THE NEXT STEP
GbdXlEMp8gg_25 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND FOLD OUR SQUASH BOOK

hf1QmW_cvp8_14 0 WE'RE NOT SEPARATE FROM NATURE
hf1QmW_cvp8_15 0 BUT IN ESSENCE WE ARE CONNECTED TO EVERYTHING
hf1QmW_cvp8_16 0 AND IN TANTRIC YOGA YOU MAY PRACTICE THE INTENTION OF SEEING HOW THAT CONNECTION FULFILLS ITSELF
hf1QmW_cvp8_17 0 IN YOUR IN YOUR PERSONAL PRACTICE ON THE MAT
hf1QmW_cvp8_18 0 OR IN YOUR EXPERIENCE OFF OF THE MAT IN EVERYDAY LIFE
hf1QmW_cvp8_19 0 SO TANTRIC YOGA IS IN ESSENCE A NON DUALIST PERSPECTIVE
hf1QmW_cvp8_20 0 WHERE DIVINE REALIZATION AND SELF REALIZATION COME TOGETHER TO CREATE THAT CONNECTIVITY IN LIFE
hf1QmW_cvp8_21 0 IN EVERYTHING THAT WE SEE
hf1QmW_cvp8_22 0 SO TANTRIC YOGA AGAIN IS CONNECTION

gQmJ3HwA718_1 0 HI THIS IS DAVE FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE ARE MAKING ALBONDIGAS SOUP
gQmJ3HwA718_2 0 OKAY SO NOW WE ARE GOING TO ADD A LITTLE EXTRA FLAVOR TO OUR SOUP
gQmJ3HwA718_3 0 THIS IS OUR TOMATOES
gQmJ3HwA718_4 0 THIS IS A FOURTEEN OUNCE CAN OF TOMATOES IN ITS JUICE
gQmJ3HwA718_5 0 YOU CAN DEFINITELY USE FRESH TOMATOES
gQmJ3HwA718_6 0 I FIND THE ADDED JUICE TO THIS ADDS A LOT OF FLAVOR TO IT SO I WOULD ALMOST IF YOU DO YOUR OWN TOMATOES ADD A LITTLE CAN OF TOMATO SAUCE TO IT TO ADD A LITTLE MORE ZING TO IT
gQmJ3HwA718_7 0 JUST GO AHEAD AND OPEN THIS
gQmJ3HwA718_8 0 AGAIN I AM USING THIS OLD TIMEY OPENER
gQmJ3HwA718_9 0 AS YOU CAN SEE OUR SOUP HAS COME TO A REALLY ROLLING BOIL
gQmJ3HwA718_10 0 WE PROBABLY WANT TO TURN DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT BUT YOU WANT TO KEEP IT BOILING JUST TO COOK THROUGH THOSE CARROTS AND THOSE POTATOES
gQmJ3HwA718_11 0 THE MEATBALLS THAT HAVE THE RICE IN THERE ARE GOING SO JUST GO AHEAD AND ADD YOUR TOMATOES
gQmJ3HwA718_12 0 AND BETWEEN THESE THESE ARE A TINY BIT SALTY AS WELL AS THE CHICKEN BROTH SO THAT IS WHY WE ADDED SO LITTLE SALT IN THE BEGINNING IN OUR SEASONING MIX BECAUSE WE CAN ALWAYS READJUST YOUR SEASONING WHEN YOUR SOUP IS DONE AND YOU CAN ADD BUT REMEMBER YOU CAN'T TAKE AWAY
gQmJ3HwA718_13 0 ONCE IT IS TOO SALTY IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO REPAIR IT
gQmJ3HwA718_14 0 SO ANYWAY THAT IS THIS STEP
gyNzeQ4nwwg_1 0 REVERSE CURLS WORK THE LOWER HALF OF YOUR RECTUS ABDOMINIS SO FROM NAVEL DOWN TO THE PUBIC BONE AND BACK
gyNzeQ4nwwg_2 0 SO IT'S KIND OF THAT LITTLE POOCHY AREA THAT TENDS TO LOOSE A LOT OF ELASTICITY THAT YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS ON
gyNzeQ4nwwg_3 0 IT'S ALL ONE MUSCLE THAT WORKS TOGETHER BUT YOU CAN PUT A FOCUS ON JUST THAT LOWER HALF
gyNzeQ4nwwg_4 0 SO ROLL DOWN ONE VERTEBRAE AT A TIME
gyNzeQ4nwwg_5 0 TAKE A MOMENT TO JUST LET YOUR SPINE GET USED TO THE SURFACE THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON SO YOU'VE GOT NICE NEUTRAL PELVIC POSTURE SOFT NECK SHOULDER BLADES ARE NICE AND STILL AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR FEET UP IN THE AIR
gyNzeQ4nwwg_6 0 NOW IF YOU NEED TO MAINTAIN THIS NINETY HERE AS LONG AS THE HIP FLEXOR IS OUT OF THE PICTURE BUT IF YOU CAN EXTEND WE'RE GOING TO CROSS ONE FOOT OVER THE OTHER
gyNzeQ4nwwg_7 0 NOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO THINK OF BRINGING THE KNEES TOGETHER BECAUSE WE WANT TO KEEP A NICE SPACE BETWEEN THE HIPS AND THE PELVIS AND THEN WE'RE JUST GOING TO THINK OF CURLING PUBIC TO NAVEL AND RELEASE
gyNzeQ4nwwg_8 0 IT'S A SMALL MOVEMENT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE A LOT OF MOMENTUM GOING ON HERE
gyNzeQ4nwwg_9 0 CRUNCH AND EXHALE AS YOU CONTRACT INHALE BACK DOWN SO YOU CAN GET FRESH OXYGEN WORKING BACK INTO THE MUSCLE BEFORE YOU TRY TO CONTRACT AGAIN AND EXHALE
gyNzeQ4nwwg_10 0 PUSH LIKE YOU'RE PUSHING THAT CEILING AWAY FROM YOU AND RELEASE
gyNzeQ4nwwg_11 0 AGAIN YOU'RE TRYING TO PULL EVERYTHING TOGETHER IT'S NOT HOW FAR WE COME OVER BECAUSE THEN I'M WORKING WITH MY BACK MORE THAN I AM FOCUSING RIGHT HERE
gyNzeQ4nwwg_12 0 SO IF I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON JUST THAT AREA BETWEEN THE PUBIC BONE AND THE NAVEL I'VE GOT TO KEEP IT SMALL AND CONTROLLED
gyNzeQ4nwwg_13 0 TRY WORKING UP TO ABOUT TEN REPS WITH RIGHT FOOT OVER LEFT AND THEN STRETCH IN BETWEEN IF YOU NEED TO AND CROSS LEFT OVER RIGHT AND CURL CRUNCH BREATHE INHALE DOWN
gyNzeQ4nwwg_14 0 YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T SEE A LOT OF MOVEMENT
gyNzeQ4nwwg_15 0 YOU SEE MOVEMENT AS A RESULT OF CONTRACTION IN THAT SMALL AREA THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FOCUS ON
hHrMg9FUMJA_1 0 NOW I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE YOU TO FINGER SPINNING WITH TWO RINGS TO GET THIS TYPE OF EFFECT
hHrMg9FUMJA_2 0 VERY USUAL VERY COOL VERY INTERESTING AND IT'S SURPRISINGLY NOT THAT HARD THOUGH IT TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO
hHrMg9FUMJA_3 0 YOU WANT TO GRIP THE RINGS SO THAT THE FINGER YOU'RE SPINNING ON IN MY CASE IT'S THE MIDDLE FINGER IS ALREADY IN POSITION TO ACCEPT THE RINGS
hHrMg9FUMJA_4 0 ALL THE OTHER FINGERS ARE BASICALLY USED AS FOCAL POINTS FOR PUSHING THE RING OUT AND FORWARD
hHrMg9FUMJA_5 0 IT TAKES A GOOD AMOUNT OF FORCE TO RELEASE THE RINGS PROPERLY AND AS YOU CAN SEE I HAVE THEM SPLIT SO THAT AS THEY TAKE OFF THEY NATURALLY SPLIT INTO OPPOSITE TIMES
hHrMg9FUMJA_6 0 NOW YOU CAN IF YOU'RE LUCKY JUST START FLAT AND GET IT THERE BUT TO GO STRAIGHT INTO IT YOU'LL WANT TO HAVE THAT SPLIT AS YOU'RE STARTING
hHrMg9FUMJA_7 0 NOW AS YOU EVENTUALLY GET GOOD ENOUGH TO HOLD THIS FOR A LONG WHILE YOU MIGHT WANT TO START MANIPULATING IT IN CERTAIN WAYS
hHrMg9FUMJA_8 0 FOR INSTANCE LIKE THAT
hHrMg9FUMJA_9 0 NOW ALL I'M DOING IS ESSENTIALLY AIMING TO KEEP MY FINGERS STRAIGHT AS I DIP IT UNDER MY ARMPIT OUT AND AROUND STRAIGHTEN MY ARM AND COME BACK OVER
hHrMg9FUMJA_10 0 THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS TO STOP
hHrMg9FUMJA_11 0 WHEN YOU'RE FIRST LEARNING IT'S GOOD MAYBE TO JUST HIT YOUR LEGS SO THAT THEY STOP THAT WAY AND YOU PIN THEM BUT YOU CAN ALSO EVENTUALLY LEARN TO CATCH THEM PROPERLY
_hh0ibfvvuU_1 0 HI THIS IS YOLANDA VANVEEN FROM VANVEENBULBS.COM AND IN THIS SERIES WE'RE LEARNING ALL ABOUT HOW TO PLANT FLOWER BULBS IN CONTAINERS
_hh0ibfvvuU_2 0 AND IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO USE FLOWER BULBS AND LASAGNA PLANTING
_hh0ibfvvuU_3 0 WELL LASAGNA PLANTING IS KIND OF A TRENDY NAME FOR JUST PLANTING YOUR BULBS IN LAYERS
_hh0ibfvvuU_4 0 SO THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF LASAGNA LAYERING IS JUST HAVING DIFFERENT LAYERS OF BULBS IN YOUR CONTAINERS
_hh0ibfvvuU_5 0 SO IN THIS PARTICULAR CONTAINER I'M GOING TO HAVE MY RECYCLED BOTTLES WITH A BUNCH OF MULCH ON THE BOTTOM
_hh0ibfvvuU_6 0 IT'S JUST WOOD STICKS AND PINE CONES AND SAWDUST AND ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF ITEMS THAT I WOULD GENERALLY THROW AWAY BUT I THINK I'M GOING TO SAVE AND USE THEM IN CONTAINERS CAUSE IT'S GREAT RECYCLING
_hh0ibfvvuU_7 0 OKAY SO ON TOP OF ALL OF MY MULCH AND MY MATERIAL I'M GOING TO PUT A LAYER OF DIRT
_hh0ibfvvuU_8 0 I'D SAY I'M ABOUT TWO-THIRDS TO MAYBE NOT QUITE TWO-THIRDS HALFWAY UP ON MY CONTAINER SO IN MY FIRST LASAGNA LAYER I'M GOING TO PUT THE LARGER BULBS IN BECAUSE THE POINT IS THE LARGER BULBS WILL WORK UP THROUGH THE SMALLER BULBS
_hh0ibfvvuU_9 0 SO I PROBABLY PUT ABOUT THREE OR FOUR OF THESE LARGER BULBS IN HERE
_hh0ibfvvuU_10 0 THESE ARE ISMENE AND THEY GET A LITTLE BIT BIGGER
_hh0ibfvvuU_11 0 AND THEN IN THE MIDDLE I'M GOING TO PUT A CANNA LILY PUT A LITTLE BIT MORE SOIL OKAY MAYBE ANOTHER ISMENE
_hh0ibfvvuU_12 0 I LIKE TO DO THREE GROUPS OF THREE SO AT LEAST THREE ISMENE BUT MAYBE ONE CANNA CAUSE IT'S A LARGER ITEM
_hh0ibfvvuU_13 0 SO I'VE GOT MY FIRST LAYER OF LASAGNA
_hh0ibfvvuU_14 0 I'M GOING TO PUT ANOTHER LAYER ON TOP OF THAT
_hh0ibfvvuU_15 0 OKAY SO NOW ALL THOSE BULBS ARE COVERED UP SO NOW I WANT TO GO WITH MY MEDIUM SIZE BULBS INTO THE POT
_hh0ibfvvuU_16 0 SO I'VE GOT SOME CALLA LILIES AND SO CROSOSMIAS THAT I'M GOING TO PUT IN THERE BUT I'M JUST GOING TO DO ABOUT THREE OF EACH
_hh0ibfvvuU_17 0 AND I THINK I'LL PUT MY TOAD LILY IN THAT LAYER TOO JUST BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GET AS ROOTY AS THE OTHER ITEMS
_hh0ibfvvuU_18 0 IT STAYS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER
_hh0ibfvvuU_19 0 YOU CAN PUT A CYCLAMEN IN THERE
_hh0ibfvvuU_20 0 WHETHER IT'S A SUN PLANT OR A SHADE PLANT IT SEEMS TO DO WELL IN THE NORTHWEST
_hh0ibfvvuU_21 0 SO I'VE GOT MY SECOND LAYER OF LASAGNA AND I'M GOING TO COVER ALL THAT UP
_hh0ibfvvuU_22 0 SO NOW I'M ONTO THE TOP LAYER SO ON THE TOP LAYER I'M GOING TO PUT THE SMALLEST BULBS THAT I HAVE
_hh0ibfvvuU_23 0 SO HERE I HAVE SOME GLADIOLUS MURIELAE ALSO CALLED ACIDANTHERA
_hh0ibfvvuU_24 0 THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE GLADS AND I'M GOING TO PUT THOSE ALONG THE TOP AND I'M NOT PACKING IT I'M ONLY PUTTING MAYBE FIVE OR SIX BULBS TOGETHER IN THIS LAYER
_hh0ibfvvuU_25 0 SO I'VE GOT MY ACIDANTHERA IN HERE AND THAT'S MY TOP LAYER SO NOW I'M GOING TO COVER THAT UP WITH SOIL
_hh0ibfvvuU_26 0 SO NOW I'VE GOT MY LASAGNA PREPARED AND TO COOK IT I'M GOING TO PUT IT OUTSIDE IN THE SUN AND OVER THE SUMMER I'M GOING TO ENJOY A SUCCESSION OF COLOR
_hh0ibfvvuU_27 0 I'VE GOT CANNA LILIES CALLA LILIES ACIDANTHERA BEGONIAS AND ALL THESE TYPES OF PLANTS THAT GENERALLY YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T PUT TOGETHER BUT I HAVE FOUND THEY LOVE BEING TOGETHER AND IT'LL BE A SURPRISE ALL SUMMER THROUGH FALL
_hh0ibfvvuU_28 0 NEXT WE'RE GOING TO DECIDE WHERE TO PLACE OUR PLANTERS
hC9daIOoq50_1 0 TRAVIS JOHNS HI
hC9daIOoq50_2 0 I'M TRAVIS JOHNS WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND I'M GOING TO BE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT ORGANIZING PROJECT FILES IN YOUR HOME VIDEO POST-PRODUCTION STUDIO
hC9daIOoq50_3 0 ORGANIZING PROJECT FILES IN A SPECIFIC WAY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO REMEMBER IS VERY IMPORTANT FROM THE START
hC9daIOoq50_4 0 BY THE END OF ANY GIVEN PROJECT YOU MIGHT HAVE TEN TO TWENTY TO THIRTY FOLDERS WITH DIFFERENT NAMES
hC9daIOoq50_5 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS LOCATED ON ONE DRIVE WHERE YOU CAN GET TO IT EASILY
hC9daIOoq50_6 0 MAKE SURE THAT WITHIN THAT FOLDER YOU'VE CREATED YOU CAN ACCESS EACH FILE AND FIND THINGS QUICKLY
hC9daIOoq50_7 0 SO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER YOU'RE LABELING THE FOLDERS IT'S INTUITIVE AND IT MAKES SENSE WITH THE PROJECT THAT YOU'RE CREATING
hC9daIOoq50_8 0 ORGANIZING FROM AN EDITORIAL STANDPOINT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR SEPARATE BINS OR FOLDERS ALL HAVE SPECIFIC PURPOSES
hC9daIOoq50_9 0 SO IF YOU HAVE VIDEO OF AN INTERVIEW AND THEN YOU HAVE B-ROLL THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CUT AWAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE IN SEPARATE BINS AND THOSE ARE EASY TO LOCATE
hC9daIOoq50_10 0 A LOT OF TIMES YOU'LL BE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PROJECT AND YOU'LL NEED TO FIND A SPECIFIC SHOT OR A SPECIFIC GRAPHIC AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO WASTE TIME DIGGING AROUND FOR THINGS THAT COULD EASILY JUST BE RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE
hC9daIOoq50_11 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY EXTERNAL PIECES OF MEDIA YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BRING INTO YOUR PROJECT ARE IN LABEL-APPROPRIATE FOLDERS SO THAT YOU'RE ALSO NOT SPENDING ANY TIME LOOKING FOR FILES OR AT THE VERY WORST HAVING TO RECREATE SOMETHING YOU'VE ALREADY MADE BECAUSE YOU JUST CAN'T FIND IT
GwGnwoKiEtU_1 0 ALRIGHT NOW THAT WE GOT ALL OUR TOOLS SET UP ALL I DID IS HERE IS JUST SLAB A CHUNK OF CLAY OWN THERE SO I DON'T LOSE THESE GUYS WORKS PRETTY WELL
GwGnwoKiEtU_2 0 SO YOU WANT TO GET YOUR YOUR MOUND TO CENTER AS POSSIBLE MAKE SURE YOU GET IT TO STICK TO THE BAT REALLY WELL BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT THIS CHUNK OF CLAY FLYING OFF ALRIGHT
GwGnwoKiEtU_3 0 SO HERE WE DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO CENTER THIS WHOLE WAD OF CLAY BUT MENTALLY IT WILL HELP YOU THROW IN THE BEGINNING A LOT BETTER IF THE WHOLE THING IS KIND OF CENTERED
GwGnwoKiEtU_4 0 SO WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW THIS IS CALLED A WHEEL WEDGE AND I'M BRING IT UP I'M BRINGING IT UP AND WHEN I'M COMING DOWN WITH IT IT'S GOING TO ELIMINATE ANY INCONSISTENCIES THREW OUT THE CLAY BODY AND THEN BRING IT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM HERE
GwGnwoKiEtU_5 0 IF YOU WANT SHORTEN THINGS UP JUST GET RID OF THAT IT'LL GO IN THE SLOP BUCKET
GwGnwoKiEtU_6 0 AND FROM HERE I'LL SHOW YOU THE WHEEL WEDGE
g6sNVEYqiqI_1 0 HI MY NAME IS AIMY KERSEY
g6sNVEYqiqI_2 0 I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT SOME GENERAL SCREEN TIPS
g6sNVEYqiqI_3 0 WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA
g6sNVEYqiqI_4 0 NERVOUS AND IRRITATING HABITS
g6sNVEYqiqI_5 0 DON'T CHEW GUM OR PLAY WITH YOUR POCKET CHANGE OR KEYS WHILE ON TELEVISION
g6sNVEYqiqI_6 0 THIS IS REALLY IRRITATING
g6sNVEYqiqI_7 0 EVERYONE HAS NERVOUS HABITS SUCH AS PICKING EARS NOSES DEAD SKIN TOUCHING NOSES HAIR AND EARS
g6sNVEYqiqI_8 0 YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO
g6sNVEYqiqI_9 0 DON'T DO IT ON TV
g6sNVEYqiqI_10 0 SERIOUSLY IT MAY SEEM FUNNY
g6sNVEYqiqI_11 0 BUT WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING CONTINUOUSLY IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA IT'S ACCENTUATED TEN TIMES
g6sNVEYqiqI_12 0 I ONCE SAW A PERSON THAT JUST BLINKED CONTINUOUSLY ALL THE WAY THROUGH A SCENE
g6sNVEYqiqI_13 0 AND IT GOT TO THE POINT THAT I WAS LOOKING AT THEIR EYES RATHER THAN LISTENING TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING
g6sNVEYqiqI_14 0 IF A PERSON TAPS THEIR FOOT A LOT FIDGETS WITH THEIR HANDS RAISES THEIR SHOULDERS TURNS AWAY FROM YOU OR BRINGS THEIR HANDS TO THEIR FACE
g6sNVEYqiqI_15 0 IN OTHER WORDS IF THEY ACT NERVOUS OR UNCOMFORTABLE IT COULD MEAN THEIR TELLING A LIE
g6sNVEYqiqI_16 0 OR AT LEAST IT COULD BE INTERPRETED THAT WAY
g6sNVEYqiqI_17 0 YOU KNOW IT SOUNDS REALLY OBVIOUS BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT YOU CAN DO ON CAMERA IS TO SIT AS STILL AS POSSIBLE
g6sNVEYqiqI_18 0 PARTICULARLY SINCE EVERYTHING ON CAMERA IS MAGNIFIED
g6sNVEYqiqI_19 0 AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE NERVOUS HABITS THAT THEY REPEAT CONTINUOUSLY
g6sNVEYqiqI_20 0 MAYBE THEY PLAY WITH THEIR HAIR OR THEY YOU KNOW HAVE THEIR HANDS IN THEIR POCKETS JINGLING THEIR COINS
g6sNVEYqiqI_21 0 THEY GOT A SHAKY LEG OR WHATEVER THEIR PARTICULAR HABIT MAY BE
g6sNVEYqiqI_22 0 SOMETIMES PEOPLE BLINK THEIR EYES A LOT AND DON'T REALIZE THEY'RE DOING THAT
g6sNVEYqiqI_23 0 IF YOU CAN SIT REALLY STILL ON CAMERA AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT BEING AWKWARD JUST MAKE VERY NATURALISTIC MOVEMENTS AND IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR HANDS PLACE THEM IN YOUR LAP

GgW-86o7UIA_14 0 IF YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM DIG A HOLE BURY YOUR WASTE OKAY
GgW-86o7UIA_15 0 DON'T JUST GO USE THE BATHROOM IN SOME RANDOM SPOT AND LEAVE IT THERE OKAY
GgW-86o7UIA_16 0 LEAVE NO TRACE IS REAL KEY FOR NATURE AND THE OTHER PEOPLE BEHIND YOU SO ALWAYS REMEMBER TO PRACTICE IT
GgW-86o7UIA_17 0 AND THIS IS HOW TO PRACTICE LEAVING NO TRACE FOR A WEEKEND CAMPING TRIP
GPYYGaoy0IM_1 0 OK SOMETIMES MY GOLFING FRIENDS WE GET A REALLY BAD LIE IN A FAIRWAY BUNKER
GPYYGaoy0IM_2 0 SO WE'RE FAR AWAY FROM THE GREEN OR RELATIVELY FAR AWAY AND WE DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE A SHOT
GPYYGaoy0IM_3 0 SO LET'S SAY THE BALL IS UP LIKE ON THIS
GPYYGaoy0IM_4 0 SO YOU'RE SWINGING DOWNHILL
GPYYGaoy0IM_5 0 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO WITH THIS SHOT
GPYYGaoy0IM_7 0 SO YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO WANT TO JUST PITCH IT OUT
GPYYGaoy0IM_8 0 YOU'RE GOING TO ATTEMPT TO TAKE ABSORB THAT STROKE AND MOVE FORWARD
GPYYGaoy0IM_9 0 BECAUSE IF YOU TRY TO HIT SOME HEROIC SHOT OUT OF THIS SITUATION A LOT OF TIMES YOU'RE GOING TO DIG THE HOLE WORSE
GPYYGaoy0IM_10 0 THEY SAY IF YOU'RE IN A HOLE STOP DIGGING
GPYYGaoy0IM_11 0 OR IF YOU'RE TOO CLOSE TO THIS LIP IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD FOR ME TO HIT A LONG IRON OUT OF HERE BECAUSE WHEN I HIT IT THE BALL'S GOING TO GO INTO THIS INTO THE LIP HERE
GPYYGaoy0IM_12 0 SO I MIGHT HAVE TO USE A SAND WEDGE AND JUST PITCH IT OUT OF HERE JUST GET SOME DISTANCE BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GET WHAT I NEED
GPYYGaoy0IM_13 0 SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER STROKE
GPYYGaoy0IM_14 0 OR YOU CAN GET A REASONABLY GOOD LIE BUT IT'S IN SOMEBODY'S FOOTPRINTS OR IT'S CAUGHT AND IT'S BURIED A LITTLE BIT
GPYYGaoy0IM_15 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE IN THESE BAD SITUATIONS IN FAIRWAY SAND DO WHAT THE PROS DO
GPYYGaoy0IM_16 0 THEY'RE NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT BUT THEY KNOW ENOUGH THAT IF THEY LOSE THEIR MENTAL FOCUS THEY CAN RUIN THEIR WHOLE ROUND RIGHT THERE
GPYYGaoy0IM_17 0 SO WHEN YOU GET A BAD LIE IN FAIRWAY SAND JUST SAY OKJUST TAKE THE APPROPRIATE CLUB AND JUST PITCH THE BALL OUT OF THERE SO YOU LIVE TO SWING ANOTHER DAY
GPYYGaoy0IM_18 0 OK SO THAT'S THAT SHOT'S NOT GOING TO PUT ME ON THE GREEN BUT IT'S PRETTY GOOD SHOT CONSIDERING WHAT I HAD TO WORK WITH
GPYYGaoy0IM_19 0 AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT
GPYYGaoy0IM_20 0 THINK OF IT AS A CHESS GAME
GPYYGaoy0IM_21 0 IF YOU RUIN EVERYTHING HERE YOU'RE OUT OF THE GAME
GPYYGaoy0IM_22 0 BUT IF YOU AT LEAST PITCH OUT AND MAYBE HIT A GOOD SHOT ON YOUR NEXT ONE AND MAKE THE PUTT YOU CAN RECOVER AND HAVE A GOOD ROUND AFTER THAT
gjinS7HdM2Q_1 0 HI MY NAME'S JOE I'M AT BREAKTIME BILLIARDS IN WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO FIGURE HOW FAR AWAY FROM THE BALL TO STAND AND ALSO HOW TO MAKE A STANCE
gjinS7HdM2Q_2 0 I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE SIX BALL IN THE SIDE POCKET
gjinS7HdM2Q_3 0 SO WHAT I DO IS I AIM MY STICK BEHIND THE CUE BALL AND WHERE I WANT TO HIT ON THE SIX BALL
gjinS7HdM2Q_4 0 I TURN MY RIGHT FOOT ABOUT FORTY FIVE DEGREES
gjinS7HdM2Q_5 0 I STEP FORWARD
gjinS7HdM2Q_6 0 THEN I BEND FROM THE WAIST
gjinS7HdM2Q_7 0 AND EXTEND MY ARM OUT WITH MY BRIDGE
gjinS7HdM2Q_8 0 AND NOW I AM THE PROPER DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE BALL
gjinS7HdM2Q_9 0 AND I HAVE A GOOD STANCE WHERE IT'S IN BALANCE AND IT IS SOLID
gjinS7HdM2Q_10 0 THEN FROM HERE I CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND STROKE THE BALL
gjinS7HdM2Q_11 0 THAT'S HOW YOU FIGURE YOUR STANCE AND YOUR DISTANCE
GoGvP6lwQJs_1 0 NOW WE HAVE OUR BUTTON UP SHORT SLEEVE
GoGvP6lwQJs_2 0 NOW THIS ONE IS GOING TO BE A SPECIAL FOLD
GoGvP6lwQJs_3 0 IT'S GOING TO BE THE SUPER HALF FOLD
GoGvP6lwQJs_4 0 IT'S NOT AS LARGE OF A SHIRT NOT AS MUCH MATERIAL BUT IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU TAKE THE TIME TO BUTTON IT UP BEFORE YOU FOLD IT UP
GoGvP6lwQJs_5 0 SO TAKE THE TIME FROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND THESE HAVE SNAPS WHICH ARE COOL
GoGvP6lwQJs_6 0 I WISH THEY WOULD MAKE MORE SHIRTS WITH SNAPS
GoGvP6lwQJs_7 0 SO SNAP THEM ALL UP
GoGvP6lwQJs_8 0 YOU STILL WANT TO KEEP THE SHIRT AS NEAT POSSIBLE
GoGvP6lwQJs_9 0 THESE ARE THE TYPE OF SHIRTS THAT YOU WOULD GENERALLY HAVE ON A HANGER BUT AGAIN FOR ORGANIZATIONAL PURPOSES TO HAVE MORE SPACE TO HAVE THINGS APPEAR CLEANER ON THE EYE WHEN YOUR GLANCING AT YOUR SHELF YOU'RE GOING FOLD THIS ONE AND ITS STILL GOING TO KEEP IT AS WRINKLE FREE AS POSSIBLE AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE PLEASED WITH THE ORGANIZATION
GoGvP6lwQJs_10 0 AFTER YOU BUTTON IT DOWN THEN I WANT YOU TO FIX THE COLLAR AND FIX THE SLEEVES AND JUST LOOK AT IT SO YOU HAVE GOOD PRESENTATION SO YOU CAN SEE
GoGvP6lwQJs_11 0 WHERE AM I GOING TO MAKE MY FOLDS
GoGvP6lwQJs_12 0 HOW AM I GOING TO KEEP THIS NICE AND EVEN
GoGvP6lwQJs_13 0 SO TO DO OUR SUPER HALF FOLD YOU'RE GOING TO HOLD TOP OF THE SHIRT BOTTOM OF THE SHIRT AND THAT'S THE SUPER HALF FOLD
GoGvP6lwQJs_14 0 PRESS IT BACK OUT
GoGvP6lwQJs_15 0 THE SLEEVE IS AWAY FROM YOU THE MIDDLE PORTION IS NEXT TO YOU AND YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THE BOTTOM AND PULL IT TO THE TOP AND THAT IS WHAT I LIKE TO DO IN MOST OF THE FOLDS
GoGvP6lwQJs_16 0 NOW BRING IT BACK CENTER
GoGvP6lwQJs_17 0 PULL THE SLEEVES
GoGvP6lwQJs_18 0 ALTHOUGH THESE ARE SHORT THEY'RE ALMOST HALF SLEEVES YOU DON'T HAVE AS MUCH TO WORK WITH BUT PULL THAT IN AND LETS TAKE THE BOTTOM UP ONE MORE TIME AND NOW YOU HAVE THE SUPER HALF FOLD
GMjQUrlMa50_1 0 NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT MIGHT HELP YOU HELP YOUR AUDIENCE TO REMEMBER YOU OR A SPECIFIC PART OF A SPEECH OR MAYBE AN AREA THAT'S REAL IMPORTANT IN YOUR SPEECH
GMjQUrlMa50_2 0 IT'S CALLED A MNEMONIC DEVICE
GMjQUrlMa50_3 0 A MNEMONIC DEVICE IS SOME KIND OF STATEMENT SOME KIND OF JINGLE SOME KIND OF RHYME THAT HELPS PEOPLE REMEMBER
GMjQUrlMa50_4 0 AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME AND YOU CAN'T REMEMBER WHETHER YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TURN THE CLOCK FORWARD OR BACK YOU CAN SPRING FORWARD OR FALL BACK
GMjQUrlMa50_5 0 THERE ARE LOTS OF LITTLE THINGS THAT ALREADY EXIST OR POSSIBLY SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD MAKE UP TO HELP YOUR AUDIENCE REMEMBER SOMETHING SPECIFIC ABOUT YOUR SPEECH
GMjQUrlMa50_6 0 THE ONLY WORD OF CAUTION IS BE CAREFUL YOU DON'T WANT TO OVERDO IT
GMjQUrlMa50_7 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TOO MANY BECAUSE YOU RUN THE RISK OF BEING CORNY IF YOU HAVE LOTS OF LITTLE CATCH PHRASES
GMjQUrlMa50_8 0 IT ENDS UP BEING A LITTLE DORKY AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT
H30BiJP8eWE_1 0 ALRIGHT NEXT TRICK IS CALLED THE EIFFEL TOWER
H30BiJP8eWE_2 0 IT'S A GREAT TRICK
H30BiJP8eWE_3 0 IF YOU EVER GO TO FRANCE THIS IS A GOOD ONE TO DO IN FRONT OF THE EIFFEL TOWER AND GET YOUR PICTURE TAKEN
H30BiJP8eWE_4 0 IT LOOKS LIKE THIS
H30BiJP8eWE_5 0 WITH A LITTLE IMAGINATION YOU CAN PICTURE THE EIFFEL TOWER THERE
H30BiJP8eWE_6 0 IT'S GOT TWO BOTTOM LEGS AND IT'S ONE POST STAYING STRAIGHT UP
H30BiJP8eWE_7 0 IT'S JUST LIKE THAT
H30BiJP8eWE_8 0 WE'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO DO THIS
H30BiJP8eWE_9 0 ONCE AGAIN JUST LIKE THE JAMAICAN FLAG START WITH A DEAD YO-YO
H30BiJP8eWE_10 0 IT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU A LOT MORE TIME TO WORK WITH IT WHILE YOU'RE DOING IT
H30BiJP8eWE_11 0 DROP IT STRAIGHT DOWN
H30BiJP8eWE_12 0 TO DO IT YOU TAKE YOUR THROW HAND
H30BiJP8eWE_13 0 MAKE AN L WITH IT JUST LIKE THAT AND YOU BRING IT ACROSS THE STRING
H30BiJP8eWE_14 0 YOU TAKE YOUR NON-THROW HAND AND YOU ACTUALLY GRAB THE STRING THAT'S COMING IN BETWEEN YOUR THUMB AND YOUR MIDDLE FINGER HERE
H30BiJP8eWE_15 0 YOU GRAB IT AND PULL IT
H30BiJP8eWE_16 0 IT'S KIND OF LIKE MAKING A SLING SHOT
H30BiJP8eWE_17 0 IT LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN LET GO AND SHOOT LIKE A SLING SHOT
H30BiJP8eWE_18 0 IT'S AN L YOU GRAB AND PULL
H30BiJP8eWE_19 0 THEN PUT YOUR NON-THROW HAND ALL THE WAY THROUGH THAT LOOP THAT YOU JUST CREATED
H30BiJP8eWE_20 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS JUST GRAB THAT ONE STRING HANGING DOWN FROM YOUR THUMB
H30BiJP8eWE_21 0 YOU GRAB IT PULL IT THROUGH THAT LOOP LIKE SO
H30BiJP8eWE_22 0 NOW WHAT YOU HOLD ON TO IS YOU GOT ONE HAND HOLDING ON TO ONE STRING THAT YOU JUST PULLED THROUGH AND YOUR THUMB IS STILL IN THIS LOOP OVER HERE
H30BiJP8eWE_24 0 WE'LL DO THAT ONE MORE TIME
H30BiJP8eWE_25 0 YOU PULL THROUGH LIKE A SLING SHOT GRAB THAT ONE STRING AND NOTICE HOW I LET GO EVERYTHING ELSE WHEN I PULL THAT STRING TO MY NON-THROW HAND
H30BiJP8eWE_26 0 KEEP THAT L WITH YOUR THROW HAND JUST LIKE THAT
H30BiJP8eWE_27 0 TAKE YOUR THUMB YOUR THUMB IS THE PIVOT POINT
H30BiJP8eWE_28 0 TAKE IT AND POINT IT STRAIGHT DOWN LIKE SO
H30BiJP8eWE_29 0 SEE HOW IS BRINGS THAT STRING ACROSS
H30BiJP8eWE_30 0 THEN USE YOUR SCISSOR FINGERS YOUR POINTER MIDDLE FINGER AND YOU PINCH THE STRING LIKE THAT
H30BiJP8eWE_31 0 NOTICE YOU'VE GOT YOUR SHAPE
H30BiJP8eWE_32 0 USUALLY WHEN YOU DISPLAY IT YOU JUST TAKE BOTH HANDS AND TURN IT SIDEWAYS TO DISPLAY
H30BiJP8eWE_33 0 THAT'S YOUR EIFFEL TOWER JUST LIKE SO
H30BiJP8eWE_34 0 ONCE AGAIN SLING SHOT PULL THROUGH GRAB THAT STRING TWIST YOUR THROW HAND DOWN PINCH AND DISPLAY
H30BiJP8eWE_35 0 WITH A LITTLE PRACTICE PUT THE SLEEPER INTO IT

H30BiJP8eWE_37 0 IT LOOKS JUST LIKE THAT
H30BiJP8eWE_38 0 THE EIFFEL TOWER
GrO4Xa4ji7o_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT OTHER ELEMENTS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN ALL THE DANCES MOST LATIN DANCES AND ANY OTHER DANCE THAT YOU CAN DO
GrO4Xa4ji7o_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE POSTURE FOR LEADERS AND FOLLOWERS
GrO4Xa4ji7o_3 0 YOUR BODY SHOULD BE STRAIGHT OKAY YOUR TORSO IS UP YOU'RE TUCKED IN FOLLOWERS AND LEADERS
GrO4Xa4ji7o_4 0 SO YOU HAVE AN ENERGY THAT COMES FROM THE CENTER OF YOUR BODY INTO YOUR ARMS AND YOUR LEGS
GrO4Xa4ji7o_5 0 ALSO WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT OF RESISTANCE
GrO4Xa4ji7o_6 0 WHEN WE HAVE OUR PARTNER WE DON'T DANCE WITH NO POWER WE MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF RESISTANCE SO WE CAN READ WHAT OUR PARTNER WANTS TO TELL US WHERE TO GO
GrO4Xa4ji7o_7 0 IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT THE MUSICALITY OKAY
GrO4Xa4ji7o_8 0 IF WE HAVE IT SLOW WE HAVE TO WAIT AND IF WE HAVE IT QUICK QUICK WE MOVE
GrO4Xa4ji7o_9 0 THESE ARE OTHER ELEMENTS THAT ALSO INVOLVE IN ANY DANCE THAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR
H9z4FIxNLyM_1 0 HI I'M AMELIA AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'LL BE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THE LAWS OF HAIR COLOR
H9z4FIxNLyM_2 0 THIS IS A POCKET COLOR WHEEL THAT YOU CAN GET AT ANY ART SUPPLY STORE
H9z4FIxNLyM_3 0 YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHAT I'M DOING WITH IT
H9z4FIxNLyM_4 0 WELL ACTUALLY THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT
H9z4FIxNLyM_5 0 BECAUSE WITHOUT THIS YOU REALLY CAN'T COUNTACT THE DIFFERENT COLORS THAT ARE GOING ON IN YOUR HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_6 0 SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
H9z4FIxNLyM_7 0 AT EVERY LEVEL THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED AN UNDERTONE IN YOUR HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_8 0 IN OTHER WORDS AT EVERY LEVEL IF I WAS TO PUT BLEACH STRAIGHT ON THAT HAIR AND LIFT IT TO YOUR LEVEL WHAT WOULD BE THE COLOR THAT WOULD BE REMAINING IN THE HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_9 0 SO IF I TOOK THE OUTSIDE COLOR OFF WHAT WOULD BE THE INSIDE COLOR IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING
H9z4FIxNLyM_10 0 WELL AT A LEVEL SIX THE INSIDE COLOR WOULD BE ORANGE
H9z4FIxNLyM_11 0 AND LET'S BE HONEST NOBODY REALLY WANTS ORANGE HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_12 0 SO WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU HAD ORANGE HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_13 0 WELL YOU WOULD PUT BLUE COLOR ON IT
H9z4FIxNLyM_14 0 AND WHAT WOULD THAT DO
H9z4FIxNLyM_15 0 THAT WOULD MAKE IT A NICE NEUTRAL BROWN
H9z4FIxNLyM_16 0 SO THESE ARE THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN PERFORMING COLOR ON YOURSELF AT HOME
H9z4FIxNLyM_17 0 I'VE SEEN A LOT OF WOMEN COME IN TO THE SALON AND THEY'VE GOT THE DARK ROOTS AND THEY'VE GOT THE REALLY BRASSIE ENDS
H9z4FIxNLyM_18 0 AND WHAT I MEAN BY BRASSIE IS THAT NICE ORANGE COLOR THAT'S A LEVEL SIX
H9z4FIxNLyM_19 0 AND THEY'RE WANTING TO KNOW WHY IT'S LIKE THAT AND I'M HAVING TO EXPLAIN TO THE THAT WHEN THEY PUT THE COLOR ON THEIR HAIR FIVE WEEKS AGO THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T USE A GOOD PRODUCT OR A GOOD SHAMPOO AND THE COLOR HAS FADED OFF
H9z4FIxNLyM_20 0 AND WHAT'S LEFT IS THE UNDERTONE
H9z4FIxNLyM_21 0 WHAT'S LEFT IS THE UNDERLYING COLOR
H9z4FIxNLyM_22 0 WHAT'S LEFT IS WHAT'S SHOWING WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE HAIR WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE COLOR
H9z4FIxNLyM_23 0 SO WHEN I HAVE TO APPLY A CORRECTIVE BASE I CHOOSE A COLOR THAT HAS A BLUE BASE
H9z4FIxNLyM_24 0 SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS RANGE I WOULD CHOOSE SOMETHING MORE IN THIS OH THAT'S RED VIOLET IN THIS ASH BLUE OVER HERE
H9z4FIxNLyM_25 0 SO I WOULD HAVE TO APPLY LIKE A LEVEL SIX AB AND THAT WOULD COUNTERACT AND MAKE HER A NICE NEUTRAL 6N
H9z4FIxNLyM_26 0 SO WHENEVER YOU'RE APPLYING COLOR AND YOU'RE WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE BRASSIE THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PULL WARM YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION YOUR LEVEL THE LIGHTNESS AND DARKNESS OF YOUR HAIR AND THE TONE OF YOUR HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_27 0 SO IF YOU'RE WARM IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF RED IN YOUR HAIR IF YOU GRANDMOTHER WAS A RED HEAD YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO PUT RED ON YOUR HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_28 0 YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO CHOOSE MAYBE AN ASH BASE
H9z4FIxNLyM_29 0 AND THAT ASH BASE WILL THEN COUNTERACT THAT WARMTH IN YOUR HAIR AND MAKE A NICE NEUTRAL COLOR
H9z4FIxNLyM_30 0 SO WHENEVER CHOOSING A COLOR ALWAYS TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE UNDERLYING TONES IN YOUR HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_31 0 ARE YOU WARM OR ARE YOU COOL
H9z4FIxNLyM_32 0 AND IF YOU'RE WARM AND YOU WANT TO STAY WARM APPLY A WARM COLOR
H9z4FIxNLyM_33 0 IF YOU'RE WARM AND YOU WANT TO BE NEUTRAL OR COOL YOU APPLY A COOL COLOR
H9z4FIxNLyM_34 0 SO WHENEVER YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE COLOR WHEEL OR WHENEVER YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT COLOR REMEMBER THE COLOR WHEEL
H9z4FIxNLyM_35 0 WHATEVER COLOR IS ACROSS FROM THE COLOR YOU WANT TO BE THAT'S THE COLOR THAT'S GOING TO NEUTRALIZE IT
H9z4FIxNLyM_36 0 SO THIS YELLOW ORANGE BLUE VIOLET IS GOING TO NEUTRALIZE IT AND MAKE A NICE BROWN BASE
H9z4FIxNLyM_37 0 SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO PICK ONE OF THESE UP IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING A LOT OF HOME COLOR
GwXYNOAlUkI_1 0 HI THIS IS DAVID FOR EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY WERE GOING TO BE MAKING PORK CHOPS WITH CARAMELIZED ONIONS AND SMOKED GUTA

gGYfv86aprE_6 0 AND THEN IF YOU SMUDGE YOUR MASCARA
gGYfv86aprE_7 0 TAKE A DRY Q-TIP

gGYfv86aprE_15 0 AND THEN IF ANY EXTRA DUST FROM THE EYE SHADOW FALLS UNDERNEATH THE EYE
gGYfv86aprE_16 0 I LIKE TO KEEP MAKEUP REMOVER WIPES HANDY
gGYfv86aprE_17 0 AND THEN I JUST GO THROUGH AND WIPE IT
gGYfv86aprE_18 0 AND THEN YOU CAN GO BACK IN WITH YOUR CONCEALER OR FOUNDATION AGAIN

H0kRukxYk8Y_1 0 HI MY NAME IS PETER I AM WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY I AM GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT CROSS COUNTRY RUNNING
H0kRukxYk8Y_2 0 IN THIS SECTION I AM GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT STRETCHING YOUR INNER THIGHS AND THAT IS VERY VERY KEY BECAUSE AS YOU ARE RUNNING YOU ARE DEFINITELY USING THE INNER THIGHS FOR EVERY FOOT THAT YOU PUT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER ONE
H0kRukxYk8Y_3 0 SO A NICE GOOD STRETCH IS JUST YOU KNOW ABOUT SHOULDER LENGTH APART AND DO NOT HAVE YOUR TOES POINTING OUT AND DO NOT HAVING THEM POINTING IN
H0kRukxYk8Y_4 0 JUST PERPENDICULARLY STRAIGHT
H0kRukxYk8Y_5 0 AND YOU PUT ONE FOOT OUT MAKE SURE THAT THE FOOT IS STRAIGHT AGAIN PERPENDICULAR
H0kRukxYk8Y_6 0 AND YOU JUST GO AHEAD AND LEAN TO ONE SIDE
H0kRukxYk8Y_7 0 JUST A NICE SLOW LEAN
H0kRukxYk8Y_8 0 IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE ALL THE WAY TO THE GROUND AND YOU ARE GOING TO FEEL THAT TIGHTNESS AND THAT STRETCH RIGHT IN HERE IN YOUR INNER THIGHS
H0kRukxYk8Y_9 0 AND YOU JUST HOLD THAT FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS MAYBE EVEN UNTIL A MINUTE
H0kRukxYk8Y_10 0 AND THEN AFTER YOU ARE DONE GO AHEAD AND STAY WHERE YOU ARE AT AND YOU JUST KIND OF SWITCH SIDES
H0kRukxYk8Y_11 0 REMEMBER THAT YOUR FOOT PLACEMENT HAS TO BE PERPENDICULAR
H0kRukxYk8Y_12 0 DO NOT HAVE YOUR FOOT FACING FORTY-FIVE DEGREES OUTSIDE OR INSIDE JUST STRAIGHT
H0kRukxYk8Y_13 0 AND THEN YOU GO AHEAD AND FEEL THAT STRETCH RIGHT THERE THIS LEG WILL JUST BE STRAIGHT AND YOU CAN FEEL THAT TIGHTNESS KIND OF RELIEVING ITSELF AS YOU ARE STRETCHING IT

GrVp4tKqG-M_3 0 IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT NECKLACE FOR THE RIGHT NECKLINE
GrVp4tKqG-M_4 0 FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU SEE THIS TYPE OF NECKLINE WHICH IS VERY WIDE THAT COMES TO THE MID-CHEST IT'S VERY NICE TO WEAR SOMETHING THAT'S SIMPLE YET IT HAS PERSONALITY AND IT HITS JUST ABOVE THE NECKLINE SO IT LOOKS REALLY WELL ON A PERSON
GrVp4tKqG-M_5 0 THE OTHER EXAMPLE THAT I CAN SHOW YOU IS WHAT I'M WEARING RIGHT NOW
GrVp4tKqG-M_6 0 IT'S A IT'S A VERY LOW ROUND TYPE OF NECK AND I'M WEARING A NECKLACE THAT HITS JUST ABOVE THE NECKLINE SO IT HAS PERSONALITY AND IT STILL LOOK GOOD AND IT'S NOT OVERWHELMING
GrVp4tKqG-M_7 0 ANOTHER EXAMPLE WOULD BE A SQUARE TYPE OF NECKLINE INTO A KIND OF TUNIC TYPE OF SHIRT
GrVp4tKqG-M_8 0 IF YOU WEAR SOMETHING LONG THAT HANGS IT GIVES THE SAME KIND OF EFFECT OF THE SHIRT IT DRAPES SO THAT WAY THIS DRAPES THE SAME WAY
GrVp4tKqG-M_9 0 IF YOU HAVE A V-NECK LIKE THIS SEE IT COMES ALL THE WAY HERE YOU SHOULD WEAR SOMETHING THAT HITS EITHER ABOVE IT OR SOMETHING THAT HITS ALL THE WAY DOWN OR MID-WAY

GfwEqxxaeP8_7 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO HAVE TWIG ON HAND JUST IN CASE YOUR HORSE DOES NOT WANT TO BE CLIPPED
GfwEqxxaeP8_8 0 IT ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A CHAIN ROPE AND A EXTENSION CORD
GfwEqxxaeP8_9 0 ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING IS TO HAVE DIFFERENT SIZE OF BLADES
GfwEqxxaeP8_10 0 YU WANT TO HAVE SOME THAT ARE GOOD FOR HIS FACE SOME THAT ARE GOOD FOR HIS BODY SO THAT WAY YOU ARE READY FOR EVER YOU WANT TO DO

h7dCH3qKytY_7 0 INHALE EXHALE AND RELEASE
h7dCH3qKytY_8 0 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO FOLLOW THIS UP WITH EXTENSION ON YOUR COOL DOWN BECAUSE HAVING YOUR HANDS FOLDED AND TURNING LATERALLY IS GOING TO CREATE A CONTRACTION SO YOU WANT TO RELEASE THAT CONTRACTION

-hJA13027qs_2 0 WE HAVE YIN AND A YANG IN EACH SYSTEM AND ABOUT A NERVOUS SYSTEM WE HAVE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH IS KIND OF CORRESPONDING TO A YIN AND A YANG
-hJA13027qs_3 0 AND A PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS CALLED DIGEST AND RELAXING SYSTEM
-hJA13027qs_4 0 AND THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS CALLED A FIGHT AND FLIGHT
-hJA13027qs_5 0 SO DURING THE DAY TIME THE FIGHT AND FLIGHT SYSTEM IS DOMINANT
-hJA13027qs_6 0 SO YOU WORK HARD AND YOU THINK HARD YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT FOOD
-hJA13027qs_7 0 YOU HARDLY EAT FOR THE WHOLE DAY BUT BY THE EVENING OUR RELAXING AND DIGESTING SYSTEM TAKE OVER AND IT BECOMES DOMINANT
-hJA13027qs_8 0 SO YOUR APPETITE INCREASE SO MUCH THAT YOU KEEP EATING AND EATING
-hJA13027qs_9 0 ONE OF THE WAY WE CAN CONTROL THIS IS USING ACUPUNCTURE TO BALANCE THIS TWO SYSTEM SO THAT YOU WON'T HAVE OVER-ACTING DIGESTING AND RELAXING SYSTEM AND KEEP EATING UNTIL YOU GAIN TOO MUCH WEIGHT

GPq0n22yvD8_4 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A SAFETY PIN OPEN IT UP AND BEND IT BACKWARDS
GPq0n22yvD8_5 0 THE ONLY REASON WE'RE BENDING IT BACKWARDS IS BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CUT AS CLOSE TO THE CIRCLE AT THE END AS WE CAN

GyLLc8VNXBA_1 0 HI MY NAME IS HECTOR INGA OWNER OF LANE FOUR SWIM SHOP
GyLLc8VNXBA_2 0 I WANT TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WOMEN'S GOGGLES
GyLLc8VNXBA_3 0 WOMEN'S GOGGLES WERE INTRODUCED JUST A FEW YEARS AGO BECAUSE THERE WAS A NEED FOR A SMALLER GOGGLE A LITTLE BIT NARROWER GOGGLE THAT WOULD FIT MORE OF THE WOMEN-SHAPED FACES
GyLLc8VNXBA_4 0 IN THE PAST THEY WERE ALL JUST UNI-SEX GOGGLES HOWEVER SEVERAL COMPANIES HAVE GONE INTO THIS AREA
GyLLc8VNXBA_5 0 I HAVE A TIER FIN THE VIEW SELENE AND THE SPEEDO WOMENS VANQUISHER
GyLLc8VNXBA_6 0 THIS IS JUST THREE SAMPLES OF WHAT WE SELL HERE
GyLLc8VNXBA_7 0 THEY'RE ALL ANTI-FOG
GyLLc8VNXBA_8 0 THEY'RE ALL UV PROTECTED
GyLLc8VNXBA_9 0 SOME OF EM COME WITH MIRRORED FINISH LIKE THESE WOMENS VANQUISHERS
GyLLc8VNXBA_10 0 AND ONCE AGAIN THEY FIT THE WOMENS REAL WELL THEY'RE SOFTER ON THEIR FACES AND THEY DON'T LEAVE THE RINGS AROUND THEIR EYES AS MUCH AS SOME OF THE OTHER GOGGLES
GyLLc8VNXBA_11 0 DURABILITY THEY AS LONG AS YOU TAKE CARE OF THEM REAL WELL YOU RINSE EM
GyLLc8VNXBA_12 0 YOU GET THE CHLORINE IF YOU SWIM IN CHLORINATED WATER TAKE THE CHLORINE OUT RINSE EM REAL WELL WITH COOL WATER
GyLLc8VNXBA_13 0 DON'T TOUCH THE INSIDE BECAUSE THEY'RE ANTI-FOG AND THEY HAVE AN ANTI-FOG COATING ON THE INSIDE OF THE LENS
GyLLc8VNXBA_14 0 SO AS LONG AS YOU STAY AWAY FROM THAT YOUR GOGGLES SHOULD LAST YOU FOR QUITE A WHILE
H9nIU6XTn1s_1 0 MANY TIMES WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING PROFESSIONALLY YOU HAVE TO BE PLAYING INTO A MICROPHONE AND MANY TIMES WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING INTO A MICROPHONE YOU HAVE TO BE PLAYING OUTDOORS
H9nIU6XTn1s_2 0 MANY TIMES WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING OUTDOORS YOU'RE TRYING TO PLAY THE FLUTE AND GETTING YOUR BREATH FROM HERE INTO THE FLUTE
H9nIU6XTn1s_3 0 PLAYING OUTDOORS THERE MIGHT BE A WINDY DAY AND THE WIND IS BLOWING INTO YOUR MOUTHPIECE AND DISTURBING THIS FLOW OF AIR SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU CAN'T PLAY WHICH COULD BE KIND OF EMBARRASSING
H9nIU6XTn1s_4 0 THERE'S A SIMPLE EXERCISE IF YOU HAPPEN TO LIVE NEAR AN OCEAN OR ANY PLACE WHERE IT'S REALLY WINDY
H9nIU6XTn1s_5 0 WHAT I USED TO DO IS GO TO THE OCEAN STAND IN THE OCEAN AND PLAY DIRECTLY INTO THE WIND SO THAT YOU LEARN HOW TO BLOW AND FOCUS YOUR WIND NO MATTER HOW MUCH WIND IS COMING THIS WAY AGAINST IT
H9nIU6XTn1s_6 0 AND THEN ONCE YOU GET YOUR MAIN NOTE FACED INTO THE WIND YOU PLAY IN A COMPLETE CIRCLE SO THE OCEAN OR WHATEVER BREEZE IS COMING GETS TO BLOW AT YOU FROM EVERY POSSIBLE ANGLE AND YOU TEACH YOURSELF HOW TO PLAY NO MATTER HOW MUCH WIND IS BLOWING AT YOU WHILE YOU'RE ON STAGE
H9nIU6XTn1s_7 0 AND YOU MIGHT THINK THIS IS INFREQUENT BUT IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS QUITE A LOT AND YOU REALLY LEARN TO DEVELOP A REALLY STRONG AMOUNT OF BREATH COMING OUT OF YOUR BODY INTO THE SHAKLEHATCHI SO YOU CAN ALWAYS MAINTAIN A NOTE NO MATTER HOW MUCH WIND IS BEING BLOWN AGAINST YOU WHICH COULD BE VERY DISTURBING

gq16AjL_UlQ_6 0 WHAT CAN I EXPECT ON A THIRD DATE
gq16AjL_UlQ_7 0 DON'T GO THERE
gq16AjL_UlQ_8 0 THIS MAY NOT BE WHERE YOU WANT TO GO
gq16AjL_UlQ_9 0 THERE WAS A BOOK CALLED GREAT EXPECTATIONS
gq16AjL_UlQ_10 0 DON'T HAVE GREAT EXPECTATIONS
gq16AjL_UlQ_11 0 THAT THIRD DATE CAN BE A VERY CRITICAL DATE BECAUSE IT IS THE MAKE OR BREAK DATE
gq16AjL_UlQ_12 0 NOBODY IS GOING TO GO FOR A FOURTH DATE IF THAT THIRD DATE DOESN'T CLICK
gq16AjL_UlQ_13 0 NOW THIS IS WHERE THE DANNEMOIS AS THEY SAY IN LITERATURE HAPPENS
gq16AjL_UlQ_14 0 YOU WERE GOING TO BE AT A POINT WHERE BOTH OF YOU ARE GOING TO BE EVALUATING THE DIRECTION
gq16AjL_UlQ_15 0 THAT THIRD DATE IS THE KEY TO THE FUTURE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE WITH THIS PERSON
gq16AjL_UlQ_16 0 AND FOR SOME REASON WE HAVE THIS MAGIC NUMBER ON MIND
gq16AjL_UlQ_17 0 WHICH IS A THREE
gq16AjL_UlQ_18 0 AND THERE IN LIES THE CHALLENGE
gq16AjL_UlQ_19 0 EITHER A AS I HAD A WOMAN CALL RECENTLY SAYING
gq16AjL_UlQ_20 0 YOU KNOW THE MAN JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH THAT I WANTED
gq16AjL_UlQ_22 0 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
gq16AjL_UlQ_23 0 I'M NOT CERTAIN BUT THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID
gq16AjL_UlQ_24 0 OR B SHE JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE DEPTH THAT I WANTED
gq16AjL_UlQ_25 0 MAYBE SHE WAS TOO SHALLOW FOR HIM
gq16AjL_UlQ_26 0 BUT THAT'S WHERE WE START MAKING OUR JUDGMENTS
gq16AjL_UlQ_27 0 AND I SAY DON'T MAKE MORAL JUDGMENTS FOR ANYONE
gq16AjL_UlQ_28 0 BUT THIS IS A POINT WHERE WE FEEL THAT WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS PERSON

guv2h74Gpyk_1 0 HI I'M JEFF WITH THE TWO WHEELER DEALER
guv2h74Gpyk_2 0 TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO CHANGE A FLAT TIRE
guv2h74Gpyk_3 0 THERE'S ONLY ABOUT ONE TOOL THAT YOU NEED TO CHANGE A FLAT TIRE
guv2h74Gpyk_4 0 AND THAT'S JUST A TIRE LEVER
guv2h74Gpyk_5 0 YEAH YOU NEED AT LEAST ONE UP TO ABOUT THREE
guv2h74Gpyk_6 0 DEPENDING ON HOW TIGHT THE TIRE IS
guv2h74Gpyk_7 0 USUALLY YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH USING JUST ONE
guv2h74Gpyk_8 0 THE FIRST THING IS YOU WANT TO START OPPOSITE THE VALVE STEM
guv2h74Gpyk_9 0 INSERT THE TIRE LEVER UNDER ONE HALF OF THE TIRE BEAD
guv2h74Gpyk_10 0 AND YOU SHOULD THEN BE ABLE TO JUST SLOWLY PRY IT OFF
guv2h74Gpyk_11 0 KIND OF UNZIP IT ALL THE WAY AROUND ENDING BACK OPPOSITE THE VALVE STEM
guv2h74Gpyk_12 0 AT THAT POINT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO REACH INSIDE THAT TIRE AND REMOVE THE FLAT INNER TUBE
guv2h74Gpyk_13 0 AND THEN YOU CAN GRAB A NEW INNER TUBE OR EITHER TRY TO PATCH THE FLAT ONE
guv2h74Gpyk_14 0 BUT THE NEXT STEP TO REINSTALLING IT IS GOING TO BE TO INFLATE THE TUBE WITH AIR JUST TO GIVE IT SOME SHAPE
guv2h74Gpyk_15 0 AND THEN YOU'LL START OPPOSITE AS IN REMOVAL
guv2h74Gpyk_16 0 AND INSERT THE STEM INTO THE HOLE IN THE RIM
guv2h74Gpyk_17 0 AND THEN TUCK THAT TIRE OR THE INNER TUBE UP INTO THE TIRE ALL THE WAY AROUND
guv2h74Gpyk_18 0 AND THEN STARTING AT THE VALVE BEGIN TO REINSTALL THE OTHER HALF OF THE TIRE BEAD
guv2h74Gpyk_19 0 BEING CAREFUL NOT TO PINCH THE INNER TUBE IN BETWEEN THE TIRE AND THE RIM AS YOU WORK THE BEAD BACK ON
guv2h74Gpyk_20 0 AND YOU WANT TO END UP OPPOSITE THAT VALVE STEM SO THAT YOU HAVE THE MOST SLACK IN THE TIRE TO ALLOW YOU TO POP THE LAST LITTLE BIT BACK ON
guv2h74Gpyk_21 0 THE TRICK IS NOT TO USE ANY TOOLS WHEN YOU PRY THIS LAST BIT BACK ON
guv2h74Gpyk_22 0 OTHERWISE YOU'RE RUNNING A HIGH RISK OF PINCHING THE INNER TUBE
guv2h74Gpyk_23 0 YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT JUST BY WORKING IT ON SLOWLY
guv2h74Gpyk_24 0 AND THERE YOU HAVE IT
guv2h74Gpyk_25 0 YOU CAN THEN JUST INFLATE IT TO YOU KNOW RECOMMENDED INFLATION PRESSURE
guv2h74Gpyk_26 0 WHICH SHOULD BE MARKED ON THE OUTSIDE OF PRETTY MUCH ALL TIRES
guv2h74Gpyk_27 0 THAT'S HOW YOU CHANGE A FLAT TIRE
HB01hhonf8Q_1 0 BEHIND THE BACK GRABS IN FRONT OF THE BODY GRABS NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO THE FINAL SECTION OF THE YELLOW BELT TEST WHICH IS STRIKES
HB01hhonf8Q_2 0 THE FIRST STRIKE IS CALLED MUNETSUKI
HB01hhonf8Q_3 0 MUNE AGAIN IS MID-LEVEL TSUKI BEING STRIKE
HB01hhonf8Q_4 0 SO MUNETSUKI KOTEGAEISHI IS THE TECHNIQUE
HB01hhonf8Q_5 0 AS HE GOES INTO STRIKE HE HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT HE PUNCHES ME IN THE STOMACH
HB01hhonf8Q_6 0 ONE OF MY WORST PET PEEVES IS WHEN PEOPLE PUNCH OUT HERE
HB01hhonf8Q_7 0 I DON'T CARE IF HE PUNCHES OUT HERE
HB01hhonf8Q_8 0 I DON'T CARE IF HE PUNCHES OUT HERE IF HE DOES THAT ALL DAY LONG ALL HE'S DOING IS FANNING ME
HB01hhonf8Q_9 0 IT'S MAKING ME COOL OFF
HB01hhonf8Q_10 0 SO HE HAS TO PUNCH LIKE HE'S GOING TO MAKE ME SEE MY LUNCH
HB01hhonf8Q_11 0 AS HE DOES THAT I DO MY TENKAN MOTION THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE VERY BEGINNING THIS TURNING MOTION
HB01hhonf8Q_12 0 SO AS HE STRIKES I TENKAN CONTROL THIS WRIST AND BRING HIM BACK AROUND
HB01hhonf8Q_13 0 PRINCIPLE OF DYNAMIC REVERSAL
HB01hhonf8Q_14 0 IT'S A BAD SPOT TO TURN SOMEONE RIGHT AROUND INTO THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE GIVING HIM MOMENTUM TO STRIKE YOU WITH
HB01hhonf8Q_15 0 IF YOU WATCH HIS OTHER HAND BOOM HE COULD REALLY CLEAN YOUR CLOCK FROM HERE
HB01hhonf8Q_16 0 SO YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THIS WRIST FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
HB01hhonf8Q_18 0 FROM HERE KOTEGAEISHI LIKE I TALKED BEFORE IS NOT A WRIST LOCK OUT TO THE SIDE LIKE THIS
HB01hhonf8Q_19 0 A LOT OF STYLES LIKE AIKIDO YOU'LL SEE A BIG HUGE WRIST LOCK WHICH GIVES IT A REALLY PRETTY FALL IT LOOKS VERY IMPRESSIVE ON CAMERA
HB01hhonf8Q_20 0 BUT IN REALITY IT GIVES HIM A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO PUNCH OR TO JUST KNOCK MY HANDS OFF AND PUT ME IN KOTEGAEISHI MYSELF
HB01hhonf8Q_21 0 SO INSTEAD WE KEEP OUR KOTEGAEISHIS VERY SMALL AND YOU'LL SEE FROM THE NEXT ONE I CONTROL THE ENTIRE BODY WITH THIS
HB01hhonf8Q_22 0 YOU'LL ALSO SEE I MOVED RIGHT INTO THE PIN THAT I DISCUSSED BEFORE
HB01hhonf8Q_23 0 EXTENDING THE SHOULDER INTO THE GROUND MAINTAINING CONTROL I'VE GOT MY ENTIRE WORKSPACE LAID OUT BEFORE ME
HB01hhonf8Q_24 0 I USED TO DO THIS TECHNIQUE TO PIN TO THE OUTSIDE BUT IF HE STARTS TO MOVE AWAY IT'S TOO EASY FOR ME TO LOSE THAT
HB01hhonf8Q_25 0 SO FROM HERE I'VE GOT HIM PINNED HERE AND IF HE STARTS TO GET AWAY I CAN TRANSITION INTO A STRIKE TO A HEAD GRAB TO A KNEE DROP ANYTHING THAT I NEED IS RIGHT HERE AT MY FEET
HB01hhonf8Q_26 0 CONTROL THE ARM STEP AWAY
hErdpsfFwec_1 0 HI MY NAME'S DAN MCLELLEN I'M WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
hErdpsfFwec_2 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO TAKE BASIC SIMPLE BALLOONS AND COMBINE THEM TOGETHER TO CREATE A COMPLEX BALLOON
hErdpsfFwec_3 0 IN OUR PREVIOUS SEGMENT WE ALREADY COMBINED A HEART WITH A TEDDY BEAR
hErdpsfFwec_4 0 WE ARE NOW GOING TO COMBINE A SMALL FLOWER AND A BASIC HAT WITH A HEART IN THE TEDDY BEAR AND PUT THOSE ALL TOGETHER
hErdpsfFwec_5 0 STARTING WITH THE SMALL FLOWER I'M GOING TO INFLATE A BALLOON LEAVING QUITE A BIT UNINFLATED SO AS I TWIST THE BALLOON MY BUBBLES I'M PUTTING THE AIR INTO THE EMPTY PART OF THE BALLOON TIE THE BALLOON OFF DO AN APPLE TIE BY STICKING MY FINGER INSIDE THE BALLOON AND GRABBING HOLD OF THE PART THAT I PUT IN THERE
hErdpsfFwec_6 0 PULL MY FINGER OUT AND THEN TWIST THE REMAINDER OF THE BALLOON AND THE APPLE TIE SHOULD STAY LIKE THIS
hErdpsfFwec_7 0 I'M GOING TO CONTINUE ON BY DOING TWO APPROXIMATELY ONE INCH BUBBLES
hErdpsfFwec_8 0 ALWAYS HOLDING ON TO THE END OF THE BALLOON SO IT DOESN'T COME APART
hErdpsfFwec_9 0 THEN TAKE THOSE TWO TOGETHER FOLD THEM NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND TWIST AND I'M GOING TO REPEAT THAT STEP TWO MORE TIME
hErdpsfFwec_10 0 THERE IS YOUR BASIC FLOWER
hErdpsfFwec_11 0 I CAN COMBINE THAT BY PUTTING A FLOWER INSIDE THE TEDDY BEAR AND NOW I'VE GOT A HEART WITH A TEDDY BEAR HOLDING A SMALL FLOWER
HgfNeFjfdJY_1 0 NEXT WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT HELMETS FOR SNOWBOARDING
HgfNeFjfdJY_2 0 WHEN GOING SNOWBOARDING YOU DEFINITELY ONLY WANT TO USE A SKI OR SNOWBOARD HELMET A BIKE HELMET OR A FOOTBALL HELMET OR A LACROSSE HELMET NONE OF THESE ARE GOING TO WORK
HgfNeFjfdJY_3 0 THESE HELMETS ARE MADE SPECIFICALLY TO BE HELD UP IN THE COLD CONDITIONS
HgfNeFjfdJY_4 0 THEY COME INSULATED
HgfNeFjfdJY_5 0 THEY HAVE A LOT OF ADJUSTABLE SETTINGS ON THEM AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY HAVE COVERINGS OVER THE EARS LIKE EAR WARMERS
HgfNeFjfdJY_6 0 NOW THEY EVEN MAKE INTEGRATED HELMETS THAT HAVE HEADPHONES IN THE EAR FLAPS BUT AGAIN YOU DO NOT WANT TO USE ANYTHING ELSE BESIDES A SKI OR SNOWBOARD HELMET BECAUSE A BIKE HELMET YES IT CAN TAKE THE IMPACT IN WARMER TEMPERATURES BUT IF YOU WERE TO BRING A BIKE HELMET OR SOMETHING ELSE TO THE MOUNTAIN WITH IT JUST THE COLD IS PRETTY MUCH GOING TO CRACK IT LIKE AN EGGSHELL AS SOON AS YOU WERE TO HIT ANYTHING
HgfNeFjfdJY_7 0 SO AGAIN JUST USE A SKI OR SNOWBOARD HELMET
GJTeGXfpmUw_1 0 NOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS DRAW THE EYES BUT BEFORE WE CAN DRAW THE EYES WE NEED TO DRAW A LINE THROUGH THE CENTER AND IT IS A CURVED LINE BECAUSE IT IS GOING AROUND A CURVED OBJECT
GJTeGXfpmUw_2 0 THIS IS GOING TO BE THE CENTER OF THE EYE ON THE LEFT EYE
GJTeGXfpmUw_3 0 NOW THE WAY THE EYE WORKS IT IS SHAPED WITH A TEAR DUCT WHICH IS GOING TO BE THE LOWEST PART OTHERWISE GRAVITY WOULD NOT WORK ON IT PROPERLY SO THIS IS THE SHAPE OF AN EYE IN A VERY CRUDE SENSE
GJTeGXfpmUw_4 0 THE OTHER EYE IS GOING TO BE A MIRROR IMAGE OF THAT BUT SINCE IT IS FORESHORTENED IT IS NOT GOING TO BE QUITE AS LONG
GJTeGXfpmUw_5 0 THERE IS THE TEAR DUCT AND WE COME AROUND HERE LIKE THIS
GJTeGXfpmUw_6 0 YOU WILL BE ERASING THESE GRID LINES LATER ON
Gg2fG6m1A2k_1 0 IT IS IMPORTANT WHEN FORMING YOUR ENSEMBLE THAT EVERYONE IN THE BAND ENJOYS WORKING WITH EACH OTHER AND CAN GET ALONG AND IS COMMITTED TO YOUR GROUP
Gg2fG6m1A2k_2 0 OTHERWISE MANY PROBLEMS CAN OCCUR
Gg2fG6m1A2k_3 0 THERE HAVE BEEN MANY INSTANCES IN THE PAST MUSICAL HISTORY OF GROUPS GETTING TOGETHER AND HAVING BAD BREAD-UPS DUE TO BAD COMMUNICATION SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND OTHER CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN YOUR BAND
Gg2fG6m1A2k_4 0 ONCE EXAMPLE IS THE BAND THE DOORS
Gg2fG6m1A2k_5 0 THE DOORS WERE A GREAT GROUP AND PLAYED MANY SHOWS HOWEVER THEY HAD SOME ISSUES WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND ALCOHOL
Gg2fG6m1A2k_6 0 IN ONE INSTANCE IN A CONCERT IN MIAMI ONE OF THE MEMBERS WAS SO INTOXICATED THAT HE COULDN'T EVEN SING OR PERFORM ON STAGE AND INSTEAD MADE AN APPEARANCE ON STAGE AND UNZIPPED HIS PANTS AND EXPOSED HIMSELF TO THE PUBLIC
Gg2fG6m1A2k_7 0 THAT WAS THE END OF THE DOORS AND THE BAND DECIDED TO BREAK UP AFTER THAT INSTANCE
GRBkx6X7G4Q_1 0 A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER WHEN YOU'RE COLLECTING ORNAMENTS IS THAT THEY DO GET DIRTY
GRBkx6X7G4Q_2 0 THEY HANG ON YOUR TREE FOR TWO MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR AND THEY GET DUSTY
GRBkx6X7G4Q_3 0 YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ON HOW YOU CLEAN THESE
GRBkx6X7G4Q_4 0 ON ORNAMENTS LIKE THESE THAT ARE THE CHARACTERS I USUALLY TAKE A BOWL OF SOAPY WATER AND ONE OF CLEAR
GRBkx6X7G4Q_5 0 DIP THE Q-TIP IN CLEAN THE AREAS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO THE DUST
GRBkx6X7G4Q_6 0 TAKE THE OTHER END OF YOUR Q-TIP TAKE YOUR RINSE WATER AND RINSE IT OFF AND SET IT SOMEPLACE TO DRY
GRBkx6X7G4Q_7 0 MAKE SURE THAT IT'S TOTALLY DRY BEFORE YOU PACK THEM UP FOR THE SEASON
GRBkx6X7G4Q_8 0 ON ORNAMENTS LIKE THE ACRYLIC YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER YOU TOUCH THEM AND IT LEAVES FINGERPRINTS WHICH MAKES THEM DIRTY
GRBkx6X7G4Q_9 0 FOR THESE I TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF WINDEX AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE TOTALLY DRY AND ALL THE WINDEX HAS BEEN REMOVED BEFORE I PACK THEM UP
GRBkx6X7G4Q_10 0 THE ONE THING YOU DO WANT TO REMEMBER WHEN YOU'RE COLLECTING OLDER ORNAMENTS AND YOU HAVE THE GLASS BALLS DO NOT WASH THEM WITH ANYTHING
GRBkx6X7G4Q_11 0 THE OLDER ONES LIKE THIS THEY'RE PAINTED ON AND IT'LL SMEAR THE PAINT AND YOUR ORNAMENT WILL BE RUINED
GRBkx6X7G4Q_12 0 SO IF THESE GET DIRTY TRY TO BRUSH THEM OFF WITH A DRY CLOTH
gwNcGWh4dQA_1 0 HELLO I AM SAROLTA EKE
gwNcGWh4dQA_2 0 HELLO I'M TAMAS KASSAI WE ARE HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE

gwNcGWh4dQA_9 0 ONE TWO THREE AND FOUR FIVE AND SIX ONE TWO THREE AND FOUR FIVE AND SIX ONE TWO THREE AND FOUR FIVE AND SIX
gwNcGWh4dQA_10 0 MAINLY THIS STEP IS THE SAME WITH THE MAN'S BASIC STEP BUT THE LEAD WILL CHANGE
GpOM5HnCHpo_1 0 HI I'M JAN KAIN
GpOM5HnCHpo_2 0 CONTINUING ON WITH OUR TAI CHI LESSON TODAY
GpOM5HnCHpo_3 0 WE ARE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD INTO OUR GRASPING THE SPARROW'S TAIL SEQUENCE
GpOM5HnCHpo_4 0 LAST MOVEMENT WE DID WAS LOOKING INTO THE PALM SHIFTING THE WEIGHT ON TO THE LEFT
GpOM5HnCHpo_5 0 SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON AND THE NEXT MOVE IN OUR TAI CHI SERIES FOR GRASPING THE SPARROW'S TAIL SEQUENCE IS GOING TO BE WARD OFF
GpOM5HnCHpo_6 0 SO MAKE SURE YOU ARE LOOKING INTO YOUR LEFT PALM WEIGHTS ALL THE WAY ON YOUR LEFT LEG
GpOM5HnCHpo_7 0 SO NOW YOU CAN PICK UP THE RIGHT FOOT
GpOM5HnCHpo_8 0 AS YOU GET READY TO STEP TOWARDS THE RIGHT BOTH HANDS ARE GOING TO FLIP OVER YOU ARE GOING TO STEP AGAIN HEEL TOE SHIFT THE WEIGHT FORWARD ALL THE WAY TO THE RIGHT LEG
GpOM5HnCHpo_9 0 BODY IS SQUARE

GpOM5HnCHpo_12 0 SINK THE WEIGHT INTO YOUR HIPS MORE WEIGHT ON THE RIGHT FOOT THEN THE LEFT
GpOM5HnCHpo_13 0 WE CALL THIS WARD OFF BECAUSE WE ARE READY YOU'RE ALWAYS READY FOR AN OPPONENT
GpOM5HnCHpo_14 0 SO THIS IS ALSO WORKING STRENGTH BALANCE COORDINATION A LOT OF INNER STRENGTH

GpOM5HnCHpo_16 0 SO FROM HERE WE WILL BE READY TO MOVE ON
GpOM5HnCHpo_17 0 TO THE NEXT STEP IN THE SEQUENCE
gVnhXUc7dJI_1 0 SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT A BARTENDER WOULD NORMALLY USE
gVnhXUc7dJI_2 0 EVERY BARTENDER HAS THEIR OWN KIND OF LITTLE SPECIAL THING THAT THEY IT'S KIND OF LIKE THEIR WOULD BE TOOL
gVnhXUc7dJI_3 0 IT'S LIKE THEIR TOOL THAT THEY JUST LIKE FOR THEMSELVES
gVnhXUc7dJI_4 0 THESE ARE THIS IS SHAKER TIN
gVnhXUc7dJI_5 0 THIS IS YOU'RE BIG SHAKER TIN IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT
gVnhXUc7dJI_6 0 SMALL SHAKER TIN GOING IN THE SHAKER TIN HELPS YOU CAN SHAKE A DRINK AND NOT BREAK ANY GLASS WHATEVER
gVnhXUc7dJI_7 0 SOME PEOPLE USE STRAINERS TO ACTUALLY STRAIN THE DRINK AFTERWARDS
gVnhXUc7dJI_8 0 I SOMETIMES USE THE SHAKER TIN ITSELF IN ITSELF TO DRAIN A DRINK LIKE THAT
gVnhXUc7dJI_9 0 THIS IS SUPER FUN IT'S A ZESTER WHERE YOU CAN GET THE OILS OUT OF LEMONS TO GO INTO A COSMOPOLITAN
gVnhXUc7dJI_10 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE THE OILS TOUCH ON THE GLASS IT'S A GOOD THING
gVnhXUc7dJI_11 0 THIS IS A MUDDLER TO MUDDLE LIKE MINTS FOR A MOJITO
gVnhXUc7dJI_12 0 YOU CAN PUT THE PRODUCT IN HERE OR WHATEVER AND JUST PUSH IT DOWN YOU'RE SQUISHING THE FLAVORS OUT IT'S JUST A WONDERFUL THING
gVnhXUc7dJI_13 0 YOU CAN DO ALL OF THESE THINGS RIGHT HERE WITH YOUR HANDS
gVnhXUc7dJI_14 0 YOU KNOW OR A PLASTIC GLASS OR A GLASS WITHIN A GLASS YOU KNOW DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT
gVnhXUc7dJI_15 0 THIS OR COURSE IS A LIME SQUEEZER
gVnhXUc7dJI_16 0 AGAIN SOMETHING YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR HANDS BUT IT IS HARD ON YOUR HANDS ALL OF THE ACID AND STUFF LIKE THAT
gVnhXUc7dJI_17 0 SO IF YOU WANT TO USE TOOLS YOU CAN USE TOOLS BUT YOU CAN BE A BARTENDER MCGUYVER IF YOU NEED TO BE
gVnhXUc7dJI_18 0 YOU'VE GOT BASICALLY A BAR GUN
gVnhXUc7dJI_19 0 THIS IS A WONDERFUL THING
gVnhXUc7dJI_20 0 YOU'VE GOT WATER COKE DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF SODAS WATER CLUB SODA TONIC WATER WHICH IS ALSO CALLED QUININE TO MAKE GIN AND TONICS AND STUFF
gVnhXUc7dJI_21 0 IF YOU HAVE ONE LIKE THIS THAT'S REALLY COOL
gVnhXUc7dJI_22 0 IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE AT YOUR HOUSE OF COURSE YOU KNOW USE WHATEVER
gVnhXUc7dJI_23 0 WITH FRESH JUICES
gVnhXUc7dJI_24 0 ALL FRESH INGREDIENTS
gVnhXUc7dJI_25 0 YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR ORANGE JUICE GRAPEFRUIT JUICE PINEAPPLE JUICE
gVnhXUc7dJI_26 0 ANY PLACE THAT YOU GO AND WORK YOU WANT TO HAVE IF AT ALL POSSIBLE YOU WANT TO HAVE THE FRESHEST JUICES YOU CAN OR SQUEEZE THEM YOURSELF
giOX89zrQMc_1 0 CINDY MASTRY CHATARAUNGA DANDASANA IS THE FOUR-LIMB STAFF POSE
giOX89zrQMc_2 0 IT'S A POSE THAT IS OFTENTIMES DONE INCORRECTLY BECAUSE OF IMPROPER ALIGNMENT WHICH CAN REALLY BOTHER YOUR SHOULDERS
giOX89zrQMc_3 0 SO WHEN YOU CAN USE A STRAP IT CAN REALLY PUT YOU IN A PERFECT ALIGNMENT AND I RECOMMEND TO ANYBODY NO MATTER HOW PERFECT YOUR CHATARAUNGA DANDASANA MAYBE TO TRY IT THIS WAY JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN THE PROPER ALIGNMENT
giOX89zrQMc_4 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE THE STRAP INTO A LITTLE CIRCLE THAT'S JUST FITS RIGHT ABOVE YOUR ELBOWS
giOX89zrQMc_5 0 SO WE'VE ALREADY MADE THIS FOR FAITH SO SHE'S GOING TO COME AND PUT THIS ON RIGHT ABOVE HER ELBOWS
giOX89zrQMc_7 0 AND SHE'S GOING TO HOLD IT TIGHT JUST LIKE THAT
giOX89zrQMc_8 0 SHE'S GOING TO COME FORWARD AND PLACE HER HANDS DOWN RIGHT UNDER HER SHOULDERS
giOX89zrQMc_10 0 AND THEN SHE'S GOING TO EXTEND HER LEGS BACK AND COME UP INTO PLANK POSE
giOX89zrQMc_11 0 SHE'S GOING TO LIFT WAY UP ON HER TOES AND BRING HER WEIGHT FORWARD CROWN OF THE HEAD FORWARD AND THEN BRING THIS STRAP RIGHT UNDERNEATH AND RIGHT ALONG THE BRA LINE
giOX89zrQMc_13 0 AND SHE'S JUST GOING TO LAY IN THAT LIKE A HAMMOCK
giOX89zrQMc_14 0 NOW YOU NEED TO NOTICE THAT HER WRIST AND ELBOW ARE IN ALIGNMENT
giOX89zrQMc_15 0 SO YOU HAVE TO BRING THE ELBOW FORWARD AND WHAT MOST PEOPLE DO IS SHOOT THEIR ELBOWS BACK SO THEIR WRISTS ARE WAY FORWARD OF THEIR ELBOW
giOX89zrQMc_16 0 YOU WANT TO BRING THAT ELBOW FORWARD AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR SHOULDERS ARE NO LOWER THAN YOUR ELBOWS
giOX89zrQMc_17 0 WHAT MOST PEOPLE TRY TO DO IS BRING THEIR SHOULDERS WAY FORWARD AND THIS CAN CAUSE ROTATOR CUFF ISSUES ALL KINDS OF BAD PROBLEMS
giOX89zrQMc_18 0 SO YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR SHOULDERS ROTATED BACK AND DOWN
giOX89zrQMc_20 0 AND SO THEN FAITH CAN JUST LOWER RIGHT TO THAT POINT AND THEN BRING HER WEIGHT FORWARD AND COME RIGHT UP INTO YOUR UP DOG
giOX89zrQMc_22 0 SO JUST RESTING IN THE HAMMOCK OF THE STRAP CAN IMPROVE THE ALIGNMENT OF YOUR CHATARAUNGA DANDASANA
giOX89zrQMc_23 0 IT'S ALSO SAFE TO DO IF YOU DO HAVE ANY SHOULDER ISSUES
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_2 0 MY NAME IS CHELL GARCIA-TRIAS AND I'M A MODERN DANCE INSTRUCTOR IN AUSTIN TEXAS
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_3 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO A PASSE TURN INTO A DEVELOPE THAT WAY THAT I DO IT IN MODERN DANCE
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_4 0 SO FIRST OF ALL I'M GOING TO START WITH MY FEET IN FIRST POSITION
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_5 0 MY HEELS AND TOES ARE TOUCHING
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_6 0 THEN I'M GOING TO OPEN MY TOES UP TO FIRST POSITION
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_7 0 I'M GOING TO PUT ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_8 0 THAT'S THE WAY I LIKE TO START THEM
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_9 0 ALTHOUGH YOU COULD START WITH YOUR FEET TOGETHER
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_10 0 AND I'M GOING TO BRING ONE ARM TO THE OTHER WHILE I BRING MY FOOT INTO POSSE
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_11 0 I'M GOING TO DO A SINGLE TURN THIS WAY
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_12 0 I'LL USE MY ARMS TO GET SOME MOMENTUM AND TURN
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_13 0 AND COMING OUT OF IT I'M GOING TO REACH MY ARMS BACK WHILE I DEVELOPE BACK AND LEAN BACK
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_14 0 SO IT'S MUCH MORE MODERN DANCE
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_15 0 BECAUSE I'M REALLY GOING TO LEAN INTO IT
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_16 0 I'M GOING TO BEND MY STANDING LEG A LITTLE BIT TOO JUST TO ACCENTUATE IT
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_17 0 SO I START WITH KNEES BENT
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_18 0 FEET IN TURNED OUT
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_19 0 ONE ARM IN FRONT ONE ARM TO THE SIDE
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_20 0 I TURN AND I DEVELOPE FRONT INTO A LUNGE
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_21 0 SO IF YOU WANT TO SEE THAT ONE MORE TIME WITHOUT ME TALKING
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_23 0 AND DEVELOPE INTO A LUNGE
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_24 0 SO THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO DO A POSSE TURN WITH A DEVELOPE THAT YOU CAN ADD SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR DANCE ROUTINE IN MODERN DANCE
hIvoEhIvk0o_1 0 SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO LEARN A THIRD ON THE G AND D STRING C AND E SO FOR THIS THIRD YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO TUNE YOUR C FIRST
hIvoEhIvk0o_2 0 AND YOUR C YOU CAN KIND OF TUNE IT AGAINST YOUR B
hIvoEhIvk0o_3 0 THERE'S A HALF STEP BETWEEN B AND C SO TO GET THE C YOU CAN JUST SET YOUR THIRD FINGER DOWN RIGHT NEXT TO THE SECOND FINGER AND THEN TO GET THE E YOU'RE GOING TO WANT THE FIRST FINGER ON D AND JUST LIKE IN THE F AND A THIRD YOU KIND OF WANT OF THINK OF YOUR C AS TUNING IT UP TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S IN TUNE WITH THE E AND YOUR E YOU CAN ALSO TUNE WITH OCTAVES
hIvoEhIvk0o_4 0 SO THAT'S THE THIRD WITH THE C AND E AND IT'S A GOOD IDEA IN THE BEGINNING TO PRACTICE FINDING THE C JUST LIKE WE JUST DID
gvjqx8Sxfrw_1 0 NOW I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE HARMONICS TO FORM SOME CHORDS
gvjqx8Sxfrw_2 0 NOW A HARMONIC AS YOU'LL SEE IN THE NEXT SERIES IS WHEN YOU'LL LIGHTLY TOUCH YOUR FINGER TO THE STRING BUT NOT DEPRESS IT ENOUGH TO EITHER MUTE THE STRING OR TO FRET THE NOTE
gvjqx8Sxfrw_3 0 NOW YOU'RE GOING TO USE THE CENTER OF YOUR FINGER WHEN YOU USE HARMONICS
gvjqx8Sxfrw_4 0 IF YOU'RE ONLY PLAYING ONE STRING YOU'LL JUST USE THE POINTY PART OF YOUR FINGERPRINT
gvjqx8Sxfrw_5 0 NOW YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THAT OVER THE TWELFTH FRET IS PROBABLY THE STRONGEST PLACE YOU'LL FIND ON THIS INSTRUMENT TO GET HARMONICS TO RING OUT
gvjqx8Sxfrw_6 0 THOSE WOULD BE CALLED NATURAL HARMONICS
gvjqx8Sxfrw_7 0 NOW YOU CAN MAKE CHORDS OUT OF THOSE IF YOU ADD THREE OR MORE HARMONICS TOGETHER THREE OR MORE ANY NOTES TOGETHER WILL FORM A CHORD
gvjqx8Sxfrw_8 0 NOW SINCE THIS UKULELE ISN'T ONE OF THE BEST INSTRUMENTS THAT YOU CAN GET UKULELES THAT ARE ALL THE WAY UNTIL $2 000.00 BUT HERE IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO RING OUT BEST ON THE TWELFTH FRET
gvjqx8Sxfrw_9 0 NOW SINCE THE NOTES INVOLVED ON THE TWELFTH FRET ARE THE SAME AS THE OPEN STRINGS THAT ONLY OCCURS IN THE TWELFTH FRET THE OPEN STRINGS MAKE A C6 CHORD
gvjqx8Sxfrw_10 0 SO ALL OF THE HARMONICS ON THE TWELFTH FRET TOGETHER WILL GIVE YOU A HARMONIC VERSION OF A C6 CHORD
g8Ko3oJQfZc_1 0 THERE ARE THREE PRIMARY POINTS FOR TREATING SHOULDER ARTHRITIS
g8Ko3oJQfZc_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE MOST EASY TO FIND
g8Ko3oJQfZc_3 0 NONE OF THE SHOULDER POINTS ARE PARTICULARLY EASY SO YOU MAY END UP JUST DOING MASSAGE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE
g8Ko3oJQfZc_4 0 BUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH IS SHOULDER SEAM AND THAT IS THE FRONT OF THE SHOULDER LARGE INTESTINE FIFTEEN
g8Ko3oJQfZc_5 0 FIND THE POINTIEST POINT OF THE SHOULDER
g8Ko3oJQfZc_6 0 MOVE DOWN AND A LITTLE BIT BACK AND YOU'RE GOING TO FALL INTO A SPACE BETWEEN THE MUSCLE TENDON AND THE BONE AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUT STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN PRESSURE IN THAT AREA
g8Ko3oJQfZc_7 0 AGAIN THIS CAN BE A REALLY HARD ONE TO FIND ESPECIALLY IN A REASONABLY MUSCLED DOG AND COCOA'S GOING TO LIE DOWN FOR THIS PARTICULAR SESSION
g8Ko3oJQfZc_8 0 YOU CAN MASSAGE THE AREA AS WELL
g8Ko3oJQfZc_9 0 IT'S VERY EASY JUST TO RUB THAT WHOLE AREA AND YOU'LL PICK UP THE NEXT TWO POINTS THAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT AS WELL
g8Ko3oJQfZc_10 0 BUT IF YOU CAN FIND THAT PARTICULAR POINT THAT'S A REALLY REALLY GOOD ONE
g8Ko3oJQfZc_11 0 WITH SHOULDER INJURY YOU QUITE OFTEN HAVE LAMENESS ON ONE LEG
g8Ko3oJQfZc_12 0 THE OTHER LEG THEN GETS WORKED REALLY HARD AND IT TENDS TO BE PAINFUL BECAUSE IT'S DOING THE WORK OF BOTH FRONT LEGS OR MORE OF THE WORK OF BOTH FRONT LEGS
g8Ko3oJQfZc_13 0 IN THAT CASE YOU ALSO WANT TO DO THE OTHER SIDE AS WELL SO DO BOTH SHOULDER POINTS
GA_8l1lwMYg_1 0 MATT GRAHAM OKAY NOW ANOTHER STEP THAT'S AGAIN NOT CRUCIAL BUT I THINK VERY HELPFUL TO INCREASING THE LENGTH OF THE STRING LIFE WHEN YOU PUT A NEW SET OF STRINGS ON IS LUBRICATING THE NUT AND LOCKSMITHS OFTEN TIMES USE GRAPHITE IN NEW LOCKS TO MAKE THE NEW KEYS FIT IN THE NEW LOCKS BETTER
GA_8l1lwMYg_2 0 SO THEY'LL PUT SOME GRAPHITE POWDER IN THE LOCK AND IT LUBRICATES IT
GA_8l1lwMYg_3 0 SO WE CAN DO THE SAME THING WITH A GRAPHITE PENCIL
GA_8l1lwMYg_4 0 AND ALL YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS GET IN HERE AT THE NUT AND JUST KINDA RUB AND TWIST WITH YOUR PENCIL IN THERE AND JUST KINDA YOU'LL BEGIN TO SEE THE GRAPHITE FLAKE OFF AND YOU CAN PUSH IT DOWN INTO THE GROOVE
GA_8l1lwMYg_5 0 AND IF YOU'VE EVER HEARD OF THE HIGH-PITCHED KINDA CATCHING SOUND THAT GUITARS MAKE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE TUNING THEM IT'S THE STRING ACTUALLY GETTING CAUGHT IN THE NUT AND THEN SLIPPING THROUGH AND THIS CAN CAUSE A LOT OF WEAR AND TEAR ON THE STRINGS
GA_8l1lwMYg_6 0 AND A LOT OF TIMES STRINGS END UP BREAKING RIGHT HERE AT THE NUT AS WELL AS AT THE TUNER AND DOWN AT THE BRIDGE
GA_8l1lwMYg_7 0 AND SO ANYWHERE THERE'S A CONTACT POINT OF METAL ON METAL OR EVEN THIS PLASTIC OR BONE THAT COMPRISES THE NUT IT'S A PLACE WHERE STRING COULD BREAK
GA_8l1lwMYg_8 0 AND THIS IS JUST ONE PLACE WHERE WE CAN USE THIS GRAPHITE AS A LUBRICANT AND IT'S GOING TO JUST CREATE A SMALL LAYER IN BETWEEN THE NUT AND THE STRING TO ALLOW THE STRING TO SLIDE THROUGH FREELY
gnPKGPaPTZ8_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS PAUL ANDERSON
gnPKGPaPTZ8_2 0 I'M FROM THE ABC CIRCUS RIGHT HERE IN HOLLYWOOD FLORIDA AND THIS IS JUGGLING FOR THE BEGINNER
gnPKGPaPTZ8_4 0 WE ALREADY SHOWED A LOT OF DIFFERENT PATTERNS
gnPKGPaPTZ8_5 0 I USED TO REALLY LIKE BOUNCE JUGGLING
gnPKGPaPTZ8_6 0 THIS IS CALLED PASSIVE BOUNCE JUGGLING
gnPKGPaPTZ8_7 0 I SHOWED IT TO YOU EARLIER ON
gnPKGPaPTZ8_8 0 YOU THROW IT UP LET IT GO DOWN UP LET IT GO DOWN UP LET IT GO DOWN UP LET IT GO DOWN
gnPKGPaPTZ8_9 0 NOW IMAGINE ACTIVE JUGGLING AND NOT PASSIVE AS YOU THROW IT DOWN
gnPKGPaPTZ8_10 0 THEN IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT QUICKER
gnPKGPaPTZ8_11 0 DOWN UP DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN
gnPKGPaPTZ8_12 0 NOW PEOPLE JUGGLE OFF DRUMS TO GET A RHYTHM OR YOU CAN EVEN HEAR THIS RHYTHM HERE
gnPKGPaPTZ8_13 0 I CAN CHANGE THE RHYTHM FROM EVEN
gnPKGPaPTZ8_14 0 ONE TWO ONE TWO TWO ONE TWO ONE TWO ONE TWO THREE ONE TWO THREE
gnPKGPaPTZ8_15 0 I'VE SEEN PEOPLE COMBING TAPPING TO JUGGLING
gnPKGPaPTZ8_16 0 LET'S IMAGINE ONE GOES DOWN
gnPKGPaPTZ8_17 0 LET'S USE THE BLUE BALL
gnPKGPaPTZ8_18 0 ONE DOWN TWO UP ONE DOWN TWO UP OR ANY PATTERN YOU LIKE TO CHOOSE YOURSELF
HforiGOhPEI_1 0 SO OF THESE FOUR CATEGORIES OF BICYCLES I HAVE HERE THERE'S A BALLOON TIRE BIKE A MIDDLE WEIGHT BIKE A MUSCLE BIKE AND AN ENGLISH BIKE
HforiGOhPEI_2 0 WITHIN THOSE CATEGORIES IS A GREAT VARIANCE OF PRICE RANGE
HforiGOhPEI_3 0 AND IT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT DETERMINE THAT
HforiGOhPEI_4 0 ONE INTERESTING THING ABOUT VINTAGE BICYCLES AND OTHER COLLECTIBLES IS HOW INTERESTS ARE SHIFTING
HforiGOhPEI_5 0 FOR EXAMPLE IF WE LOOK AT BALLOON TIRE BIKES THESE ARE COOL OLD BIKES THAT HAVE A LOT OF STYLE A LOT OF ART DECO LOOK TO THEM
HforiGOhPEI_6 0 THAT CHAIN GUARD IS GORGEOUS
HforiGOhPEI_7 0 THESE AT AT TIME WERE COLLECTED BY PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY RODE THESE BIKES
HforiGOhPEI_8 0 NOW THE PEOPLE THAT RODE THESE BIKES IN THE THIRTIES FORTIES AND EARLY NINETEEN FIFTIES THEY'RE NOT INTO COLLECTING ANY BIKES RIGHT NOW SO THE VALUE ON THESE HAS DROPPED BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AS MUCH OF A DEMAND
HforiGOhPEI_9 0 ALTHOUGH THEY ARE STILL BEAUTIFUL BIKES JUST FOR THEIR JUST FOR THEIR LOOK
HforiGOhPEI_10 0 OVER HERE THE MIDDLE WEIGHT BIKES THESE ALSO HAVE LIMITED COLLECTABILITY
HforiGOhPEI_11 0 THEY WERE ONLY MADE THIS STYLE WAS MADE FOR MAYBE TEN YEARS
HforiGOhPEI_12 0 THEY KIND OF HAVE THE JET STREAM LOOK TO THEM KIND OF SPACE AGE LOOK TO THEM BUT THEY WERE ONLY MADE FROM SAY 1955 TO 1965 SO THE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION THAT GOT ONE OF THESE FOR CHRISTMAS OR RODE THEM ON THEIR PAPER ROUTE IT'S A MUCH SMALLER SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION
HforiGOhPEI_13 0 OVER HERE THE MUSCLE BIKES THESE REALLY PEAKED A FEW YEARS AGO AND ARE STARTING TO COME DOWN BECAUSE WELL ONE BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY IN GENERAL BUT TWO BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT RODE THESE WHEN THEY TURNED SAY FORTY AND THEY THEIR KIDS ARE TEN YEARS OLD AND NOW THEY START THINKING ABOUT THE BIKE THEY HAD WHEN THEY WERE A KID WELL THEY WANT TO GO OUT AND FIND ONE
HforiGOhPEI_14 0 AND THERE WAS A HUGE RUSH ON THESE CYCLES FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS
HforiGOhPEI_15 0 AND TODAY THIS BIKE IF IT WENT FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A FEW YEARS AGO THIS BIKE WOULD HAVE GONE FOR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THIS CONDITION JUST AS IT SITS
HforiGOhPEI_16 0 IN THE ENGLISH BIKES THESE ARE TIMELESS
HforiGOhPEI_17 0 THEY'RE COLLECTED BY PEOPLE THAT HAD THEM WHEN THEY WERE GROWING UP AND THEY'RE ALSO COLLECTED BY PEOPLE THAT WANT THEM AS A GOOD RIDABLE COMMUTER BIKE
HforiGOhPEI_18 0 THEY HAVE FENDERS THEY HAVE AN UPRIGHT RIDING POSITION A COMFORTABLE SEAT AND THEY CAN BE SHIFT WHILE THEY'RE STOPPED

GkW7JLLsOT0_1 0 HI MY NAME IS CHELL GARCIA-TRIAS AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A WAY IN MODERN DANCE THAT WE OPEN UP OUR HIPS
GkW7JLLsOT0_2 0 IT'S VERY SIMPLE WAY WE'RE JUST GOING TO LAY FLAT ON OUR BACK WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR SPINE IS PUSHING TOWARDS THE GROUND WHILE WE'RE LAYING ON OUR BACK
GkW7JLLsOT0_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO BRING OUR KNEES TOWARDS OUR CHEST AND WE'RE GOING TO JUT GENTLY MANIPULATE OUR KNEES SO THAT WE'RE OPENING UP OUR HIPS

GkW7JLLsOT0_8 0 AND THEN I'LL START DOING LITTLE CIRCLES WITH THEM
GkW7JLLsOT0_9 0 THIS IS A WAY NOT ONLY TO OPEN UP YOUR HIPS BUT TO OPEN UP YOUR LOWER BACK
GkW7JLLsOT0_10 0 IF YOU'RE HAVING ANY LOWER BACK PAIN THIS IS A NICE WAY TO JUST RELEASE ANY TENSION IN YOUR LOWER BACK
GkW7JLLsOT0_11 0 I'M GOING TO GO SIDE TO SIDE LITTLE HALF CIRCLES I'LL DO CIRCLES WITH ONE LEG AND THEN THE OTHER

GkW7JLLsOT0_14 0 IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN I'M DOING THIS THAT I ACTUALLY MOVE REALLY SLOWLY
GkW7JLLsOT0_15 0 I'M DOING IT KIND OF QUICKLY FOR THE SAKE OF TIME BUT REALLY I CAN JUST TAKE DEEP BREATHS AND JUST REALLY GENTLY MOVE MY LEGS AROUND AND FEEL MY HIPS JUST OPENING UP AND RELAXING

hBCqGjbZBb8_2 0 I AM JIM LESKE AND THIS IS BEAR ANIMAL TRAINER BEHAVIORIST FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
hBCqGjbZBb8_3 0 WE'RE HERE TALKING TODAY ABOUT THE NEXT EXERCISE WALKING THROUGH A CROWD
hBCqGjbZBb8_4 0 ONCE YOU'VE MASTERED OUT FOR A WALK NOW YOU WANT TO START ADDING AS MANY DISTRACTIONS AS POSSIBLE
hBCqGjbZBb8_5 0 THIS IS GOING TO INCLUDE CROWDS SHOPPING MALLS RESTAURANTS BUSY STREETS CARS YOU NAME IT ITS ALL GOOD
hBCqGjbZBb8_6 0 AS YOU SEE BEAR IS VERY VERY CALM AROUND ALL THESE DISTRACTIONS
hBCqGjbZBb8_7 0 NOW WHEN I AM WALKING THROUGH THE CROWD MY GOAL HERE IS FOR BEAR ITS OK FOR HIM TO SNIFF A LITTLE BIT BUT THAT'S A SNIFF
hBCqGjbZBb8_8 0 HE SHOULDN'T LUNGE ON THE LEASH HE SHOULDN'T BE BARKING AND HE DEFINITELY SHOULDN'T BE JUMPING ON PEOPLE

hBCqGjbZBb8_19 0 VERY GOOD BOY
hBCqGjbZBb8_21 0 I AM JIM THIS IS BEAR AND THAT WAS WALKING THROUGH A CROWD
hBCqGjbZBb8_22 0 THANKS FOR WATCHING
HHPKoXEPZq4_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS NIALL O'LEARY FROM THE NIALL O'LEARY SCHOOL OF IRISH DANCE IN NEW YORK CITY AND TODAY I'M DEMONSTRATING BEGINNER SOFT SHOE IRISH DANCE
HHPKoXEPZq4_2 0 WE ARE NOW GOING TO DO A MOVE CALLED THE PIVOT TURN
HHPKoXEPZq4_3 0 AND A PIVOT IS WHERE YOUR SPINNING AROUND ON ONE FOOT AND THE CRITICAL THING HERE IS TO KEEP YOUR BALANCE
HHPKoXEPZq4_4 0 SO YOU PUT YOUR FOOT ON THE FLOOR WE ARE GOING TO SPIN AROUND THE RIGHT FOOT AND SO THE IDEA IS TO PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR FOOT AND THEN MOVE YOUR WEIGHT MOVE YOUR BODY WEIGHT YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY OVER THAT FOOT AND PUSH OFF WITH THE BACK FOOT
HHPKoXEPZq4_6 0 SO WHAT I DID THERE I PUT MY FOOT ON THE FLOOR THEN BEFORE I START TURNING I MOVE MY WEIGHT OVER MY FOOT AND I GAVE MYSELF SOME MOMENTUM BY PUSHING OFF
HHPKoXEPZq4_7 0 AND THIS IS A POPULAR MOVE IN OTHER KIND OF DANCES PRETTY MUCH WE USING ARMS BUT HERE OF COURSE WE ARE NOT USING ARMS SO THE PUSH OFF OCCURS ON THE BACK FOOT
HHPKoXEPZq4_8 0 WATCH ONCE MORE AND I'M KEEPING MY TOES POINTED ON THE FLOOR AND IN THE AIR
HiwtELMng_A_1 0 THE DEROBEMENT IS A FAIRLY SIMPLE MANEUVER IN THEORY THAT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO PULL OFF
HiwtELMng_A_2 0 AND ALL IT IS IS EVADING YOUR OPPONENT'S ATTEMPT TO TAKE YOUR BLADE
HiwtELMng_A_3 0 SO IF YOUR OPPONENT TRIES TO BIND OR TO BEAT YOUR BLADE AND YOU SUCCESSFULLY AVOID CONTACT COMPLETELY WHILE MAINTAINING YOUR RIGHT-OF-WAY THEN YOU'VE PULLED OFF A SUCCESSFUL ONE
HiwtELMng_A_4 0 SO PART OF THE DIFFICULTY IN PULLING OFF ONE NOT JUST EVADING A VERY QUICK MOVEMENT BY YOUR OPPONENT ON YOUR BLADE BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT FOR IT TO FOR IT TO BE A DEROBEMENT I'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED RIGHT-OF-WAY
HiwtELMng_A_5 0 SO MY ARM IS STRAIGHT AND IT HAS TO REMAIN STRAIGHT FOR ME TO CONTINUE TO PULL OFF THIS MANEUVER
HiwtELMng_A_6 0 SO IF MY OPPONENT ATTEMPTS TO BEAT MY BLADE AND I DISENGAGE BEFORE SHE MAKES CONTACT I'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND OF COURSE SINCE I HAVE MAINTAINED THAT RIGHT-OF-WAY AND AVOIDED HER ATTEMPT TO TAKE IT FROM ME I WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT IMMEDIATELY WITH THE THRUST
HiwtELMng_A_7 0 YOU CAN I IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE A DISENGAGE I COULD EVADE IN A LOT OF WAYS
HiwtELMng_A_8 0 I MIGHT TRY A COUPI OVER THE BLADE
HiwtELMng_A_9 0 I CAN ALSO DO SEVERAL IN A ROW AS LONG AS I MAINTAIN THAT RIGHT-OF-WAY
HiwtELMng_A_10 0 SO IF SHE'S TRYING DIFFERENT MANEUVERS AND I'M MANAGING TO EVADE HER EACH TIME AND OF COURSE IT'S MOVING MUCH FASTER THAN THAT THEN AS SOON AS I SEE AN OPENING FOR AS LONG AS I CAN AVOID HER BLADE AND KEEP MY ARM STRAIGHT I CAN MOVE IN FOR A THRUST
HiwtELMng_A_11 0 LET'S SHOW HOW THAT WORKS WITH A LITTLE BLADE ON BLADE ACTION
HiwtELMng_A_12 0 OKAY DEMONSTRATING THE SAME MOVES FROM HERE MY OPPONENT ATTEMPTS TO BEAT MY BLADE AND I KNOW ITS COMING I CAN DISENGAGE IN TIME AND THEN MOVE IN FOR A THRUST WHILE I STILL HAVE RIGHT-OF-WAY
HiwtELMng_A_13 0 OR ONCE AGAIN MY POINT IS STILL ON LINE MY ARM IS COMPLETELY EXTENDED BUT IF SHE ATTEMPTS TO BIND OR BEAT AND I HAD MANAGED TO ACTUALLY AVOID HER BLADE THEN I COULD COME IN FOR AN ATTACK
HiwtELMng_A_14 0 IF OUR BLADE IF HER BLADE DOES MAKE CONTACT WITH MINE THEN I THEN I RISK LOSING RIGHT-OF-WAY BEING COUNTED AS BEING PARRIED AND OF COURSE THEN THE VULNERABILITY IS MINE AND MY OPPONENT'S MOST LIKELY TO SCORE A TOUCH
HiwtELMng_A_15 0 SO WHEN PULLED OFF CORRECTLY WHEN YOU CAN AVOID YOUR OPPONENT'S BLADE WHEN THEY'RE ATTEMPTING TO TAKE IT FROM YOU IT CAN BE USEFUL IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT SEQUENCES
hJN6x8mJ8xs_1 0 SO SOME OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PINK LUSTER THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER WHEN YOUR OUT THERE LOOKING AND COLLECTING IS YOU'LL FIND PATTERNS SUCH AS THIS
hJN6x8mJ8xs_2 0 JUST GREAT FINE AND LEAF PATTERNS WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PINK ON IT AND A NICE DESIGN ON THE OUTSIDE THIS IS ONE TYPE OF PINK LUSTER WITH A PATTERN THAT YOU MIGHT COLLECT
hJN6x8mJ8xs_3 0 THE OTHER ONE WE TALKED ABOUT TO IS THE HOUSE PATTERN VERY TYPICAL YOU'LL FIND THIS HOUSE IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SHAPES
hJN6x8mJ8xs_4 0 HERE'S ONE SHAPE RIGHT HERE HERE'S ANOTHER HOUSE PATTERN THATS MUCH SIMPLER THIS IS ONE THAT YOU MIGHT FIND OUT THERE TOO
hJN6x8mJ8xs_5 0 ALSO A LOT OF LUSTER BUT YOU MIGHT ALSO FIND A HOUSE PATTERN LIKE THIS VERY SIMILAR BUT DIFFERENT
hJN6x8mJ8xs_6 0 TOTALLY DIFFERENT HOUSE PATTERNS SO THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF VARIETIES OF HOUSE PATTERN THAT YOU CAN LOOK FOR
hJN6x8mJ8xs_7 0 THESE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES SOME OF THE OTHER EXAMPLES OF PINK LUSTER THAT YOU MIGHT FIND THERE'S SEAMS LIKE THIS EARLY 19TH CENTURY YOU'LL SEE PATTERNS WITH SHAPES WITH DOGS AND WOMAN AND DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THEY'RE DOING HERE
hJN6x8mJ8xs_8 0 YOU CAN SEE HERE WITH ANOTHER PERSON TWO PEOPLE IN A BED OF FLOWERS VERY TYPICAL OF THAT PERIOD YOU'LL FIND ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF SEAMS LIKE THIS THAT IS ANOTHER TYPE OF PINK LUSTER YOU MIGHT FIND
hJN6x8mJ8xs_9 0 HERE'S ANOTHER TYPICAL PATTERN HERE WITH A BASKET PATTERN WITH FLOWERS IN IT THIS IS ANOTHER PATTERN YOU MIGHT FIND OUT THERE WITH A LITTLE LESS LUSTER ON THE OUTSIDE
hJN6x8mJ8xs_10 0 YOU'LL FIND THESE ALSO IN A HANDLESS CUP YOU HAVE IT BOTH WITH A HANDLE AND WITHOUT SO THOSE ARE EXAMPLES OF CUPS AND SAUCERS WITH DIFFERENT PATTERNS THAT YOU MIGHT FIND
hJN6x8mJ8xs_11 0 SO THOSE ARE SOME EXAMPLES HERE'S ANOTHER ONE THAT'S A LITTLE MORE UNUSUAL YOUR GOING TO FIND THAT THERE'S MORE GREEN AND WHITE BACKGROUND TO THIS WITH A LEAF VINE ON IT
hJN6x8mJ8xs_12 0 THIS IS ANOTHER TYPE OF PINK LUSTER SO THERE'S A QUIT OF VARIATION THERE'S ONE OTHER ONE THAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU HERE AND THIS IS A CUP AND SAUCER HERE THAT HAS A LEAF PATTERN TO IT ALSO
hJN6x8mJ8xs_13 0 WHICH IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING WE SEEN SO FAR SO THERE IS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT COLORS AND PATTERNS AND SHAPES THAT YOU CAN BUY OUT THERE SO THESE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES OF WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK FOR WHEN YOUR LOOKING FOR PINK LUSTER
hCOC5kOCkPk_1 0 OKAY A NICE FILLER FLOWER TO COMPLIMENT THE TULIPS IS BABIES BREATH
hCOC5kOCkPk_2 0 IT'S LIKE A CLASSIC COMBINATION
hCOC5kOCkPk_3 0 NICE AND SPRINGY
hCOC5kOCkPk_4 0 JUST TAKE THE BABIES BREATH
hCOC5kOCkPk_5 0 BREAK IT OFF INTO LITTLE PIECES LIKE THIS SO IT'S GOT JUST ENOUGH LENGTH TO BE STICKING OUT BENEATH THE HEADS OF THE TULIPS
hCOC5kOCkPk_6 0 AND THEN WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS CUT EACH STEM SO YOU HAVE A LITTLE POINT ON IT AGAIN AND JUST SLIP IT IN BETWEEN THE TULIPS LIKE THAT
hCOC5kOCkPk_7 0 MAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING IT IN THE WATER
hCOC5kOCkPk_8 0 AGAIN YOU ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE CUTTING THE STEMS JUST BEFORE YOU PUT THEM INTO WATER BECAUSE THEY START SUCKING AIR AND IF YOU PUT THEM IMMEDIATELY INTO WATER THEY START SUCKING WATER AND THAT'S THE BEST THING FOR FRESH FLOWERS AND FOR KEEPING THEM FRESH
hCOC5kOCkPk_9 0 SO AGAIN YOU'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE YOUR BABIES BREATH AND YOU'RE GOING TO GO IN BETWEEN THE BABIES BREATH LIKE THIS AND JUST SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO WIGGLE IT THROUGH IT DOESN'T GO IN AS EASILY
hCOC5kOCkPk_10 0 BUT YOU CUT YOUR STEMS AND TUCK THEM IN AND JUST KEEP GOING AROUND LIKE THAT UNTIL YOU GET YOU CAN ADD AS MUCH AS YOU WANT
hCOC5kOCkPk_11 0 SOMETIMES IT LOOKS PRETTY WITH A LOT OF BABIES BREATH
hCOC5kOCkPk_12 0 JUST DEPENDING ON THE FLOWER BUT THIS IS TULIPS SO IT'S NICE AND SPRINGY LOOKING
hCOC5kOCkPk_13 0 AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO KEEP GOING AND FILLING IN BETWEEN THE BLOOMS AND GIVE IT A NICE FRESH SPRINGY LOOK
hCOC5kOCkPk_14 0 AND THAT'S HOW YOU ACCESSORIZE YOUR TULIPS WITH A FILLER FLOWER
hCOC5kOCkPk_15 0 JUST LIKE THAT
h9rfiL035ao_1 0 ONE OF MY FAVORITE TOOLS IS CALLED THE DIVIDER
h9rfiL035ao_2 0 IT'S A FAVORITE TOOL OF MINE NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH WORK I NEED TO DO WITH IT BUT ALSO JUST BECAUSE AS A TOOL AS AN OBJECT IT HAPPENS TO BE VERY LOVELY VERY BEAUTIFUL
h9rfiL035ao_3 0 I HAVE ANOTHER ONE WHICH IS SMALLER AND WHICH HAS A WAY OF BEING FIXED
h9rfiL035ao_4 0 SO I WOULD USE THIS ONE FOR SMALLER JOBS
h9rfiL035ao_5 0 OKAY BUT BASICALLY WHAT A DIVIDER DOES IS IT KEEPS ME FROM HAVING TO MESS AROUND WITH A RULER
h9rfiL035ao_6 0 SO LET'S SAY THAT THE PIECE THAT I'M GOING TO DO NEEDS TO BE SYMMETRICALLY LINED
h9rfiL035ao_7 0 AND LET'S SAY I DON'T WANT TO BOTHER WITH A RULER BUT I NEED TO FIND THE CENTER FROM HERE TO HERE
h9rfiL035ao_8 0 SO THEN I'M GOING TO PLAY THE EYEBALL GAME
h9rfiL035ao_9 0 AND I'M GOING TO GO LIKE THAT AND HOLD TIGHT HERE

h9rfiL035ao_14 0 GOING TO PUT A HOLE IN THERE
h9rfiL035ao_15 0 THAT'S PRETTY CLASSIC

gPOtSEvgM9A_1 0 OKAY WE'RE GETTING READY TO START OUR SECOND BRAID
gPOtSEvgM9A_2 0 AND BEFORE WE START AS ALWAYS WE WANT TO COMB IT OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT TO MAKE IT EASIER TO SEPARATE AS WE MOVE ALONG
gPOtSEvgM9A_3 0 JUST PICK IT OUT VERY GENTLY VERY LOOSELY
gPOtSEvgM9A_4 0 NOTHING TOO SERIOUS
gPOtSEvgM9A_5 0 JUST TO GET IT NICE AND TANGLE FREE
gPOtSEvgM9A_6 0 THERE WE GO
gPOtSEvgM9A_8 0 SO AGAIN WE START FROM THE TOP
gPOtSEvgM9A_9 0 AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GRAB A GOOD SECTION OF HAIR
gPOtSEvgM9A_10 0 AND PUT THIS OUT OF THE WAY
gPOtSEvgM9A_12 0 START RIGHT HERE
gPOtSEvgM9A_13 0 NOT USE SO MUCH
gPOtSEvgM9A_14 0 AND DIVIDE IT IN THREE
gPOtSEvgM9A_15 0 ALL BRAIDS START THE SAME WAY
gPOtSEvgM9A_16 0 GO UNDER UNDER
gPOtSEvgM9A_18 0 START FROM THE OUTSIDE AND WORK YOUR WAY DOWN
gPOtSEvgM9A_19 0 AND MAKE SURE YOU STAY CENTERED AS YOU GO ALONG THE HEAD WITH MORE BRAIDS IT JUST BECOMES THAT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO REMAIN CENTERED LIKE THIS
gPOtSEvgM9A_20 0 OTHERWISE THE WHOLE STYLE WILL BE COMPLETELY THROWN OFF IF YOU BRAID IS LEANING TOWARDS ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER
gPOtSEvgM9A_21 0 SO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KEEP PULLING IT TO CHECK IT
gPOtSEvgM9A_22 0 TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S TIGHT
gPOtSEvgM9A_23 0 IF IT'S TIGHT IT WILL STAY CENTERED
gPOtSEvgM9A_24 0 AND JUST KEEP PULLING IT
gPOtSEvgM9A_25 0 AND KEEP ADDING HAIR GRABBING IT AS WE GO DOWN
gPOtSEvgM9A_26 0 AND THIS ONE'S GOING TO STAY FAIRLY THICK THROUGHOUT
gPOtSEvgM9A_27 0 UNLIKE THIS ONE WHICH GOT REALLY THIN RIGHT HERE
gPOtSEvgM9A_28 0 SO IT'S EASIER TO ADD A CONSISTENT AMOUNT OF HAIR TO EACH PIECE
gPOtSEvgM9A_29 0 JUST TO KEEP IT NICE AND EVEN
gPOtSEvgM9A_30 0 JUST TO KEEP IT GOING SMOOTH
gPOtSEvgM9A_31 0 AND JUST KEEP RUNNING THE HAIR THROUGH YOUR FINGERS AS WE MOVE ALONG
G7SwE2hqfRI_1 0 JASON SHERIDAN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS JASON SHERIDAN FOR SHERIDAN FENCING ACADEMY HERE IN NEW YORK CITY
G7SwE2hqfRI_2 0 TODAY WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT BEGINNING SABRE FENCING
G7SwE2hqfRI_3 0 VARIETY IS VERY IMPORTANT IN FENCING
G7SwE2hqfRI_4 0 SO WE WANT TO LEARN DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THINGS DIFFERENT KINDS OF LUNGES DIFFERENT KINDS OF ADVANCES DIFFERENT KINDS OF EVERYTHING
G7SwE2hqfRI_5 0 ONE THING WE CAN LEARN THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT IS ANOTHER WAY TO MOVE FORWARD
G7SwE2hqfRI_6 0 INSTEAD OF ADVANCE OR STEP FORWARD LIKE WE DID BEFORE WE CAN DO A JUMP WHICH WILL LOOK LIKE THIS
G7SwE2hqfRI_7 0 WHAT I'M DOING HERE IS I'M MOVING IN A QUICK EXPLOSIVE WAY JUST FORWARD STARTING WITH THE FRONT FOOT BUT BOTH FEET ARE LANDING TOGETHER
G7SwE2hqfRI_8 0 WATCH CAREFULLY LIKE SO

hG4tA79HozQ_1 0 FOR YOUR FLAMINGO DESIGN YOU'RE GOING TO NEED YOUR HOT PINK STRIPING BRUSH
hG4tA79HozQ_2 0 YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO NEED YOUR BLACK STRIPING BRUSH AND YOU'RE GOING TO NEED YOUR SMALLEST SIZE DOTTER
hG4tA79HozQ_3 0 I'M GOING TO BE USING THAT FOR THE EYE SO YOU WANT TO GET IT AS SMALL AS YOU CAN BECAUSE THE FLAMINGO'S HEAD IS SO SMALL
hG4tA79HozQ_4 0 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A STRIPING BRUSH AND A POLISH BRUSH IS THE WIDTH OF THE BRUSH
hG4tA79HozQ_5 0 A POLISH BRUSH IS WIDE ENOUGH TO COVER MOST OF A NAIL IN THREE STROKES
hG4tA79HozQ_6 0 SINCE YOU'RE DOING SUCH FINE ARTWORK YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO USE A STRIPING BRUSH WHICH IS LIKE A FINE DETAILER DETAILING BRUSH ITSELF
hG4tA79HozQ_7 0 IT'S VERY FINE SO YOU CAN GET SMALLER LINES
hG4tA79HozQ_8 0 THE LINES AREN'T GOING TO BE AS WIDE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE AS THICK
hG4tA79HozQ_9 0 AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET MORE OF A CURVE WHEN YOU'RE WANTING TO DO A CURVED DESIGN
hG4tA79HozQ_10 0 THE BRUSH IS ACTUALLY GOING TO MOVE A LOT EASIER THAN IF YOU HAD A REGULAR SIZE POLISH BRUSH
hG4tA79HozQ_11 0 THAT'S WHY YOU NEED THE STRIPING BRUSHES
hG4tA79HozQ_12 0 AGAIN YOU CAN FIND THESE AT YOUR LOCAL BEAUTY STORE
hG4tA79HozQ_13 0 THEY COME IN ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES FROM NEON COLORS TO PRIMARY COLORS TO PASTELS
hG4tA79HozQ_14 0 AND ANYTHING ALSO GLITTERS ANY COLOR THAT YOU CAN THINK OF
hG4tA79HozQ_15 0 AND THIS IS HOW YOU'RE GOING TO START YOUR FLAMINGO DESIGN
hG4tA79HozQ_16 0 THESE ARE THE TOOLS THAT YOU WILL NEED
gP-a7pUorgo_1 0 ANOTHER STEP OF WINE TASTING IS LOOKING AT A WINE FOR BUBBLES AND EVERYBODY KNOWS A SPARKLING WINE HAS BUBBLES AND THEY'RE EASY TO SEE AND THEY'RE FUN TO TASTE
gP-a7pUorgo_2 0 HOWEVER ANY WINE EVEN A STILL WINE WILL HAVE SOME BUBBLES IN IT
gP-a7pUorgo_3 0 YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEE THEM AND YOU MIGHT NOT
gP-a7pUorgo_4 0 IF YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR A WINE AND SEE IF IT HAS BUBBLES LOOK STRAIGHT DOWN IN IT
gP-a7pUorgo_5 0 LOOK AROUND THE OUTSIDE A LOT OF TIMES BUBBLES TEND TO STICK AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE GLASS
gP-a7pUorgo_6 0 THEY MIGHT ALSO STICK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE GLASS AND MAYBE BE RANDOMLY STUCK THROUGHOUT THE BOTTOM OF THE GLASS OR YOU MIGHT EVEN HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FIZZ AND THIS IS IN A WINE THAT'S A STILL WINE EVEN A VERY STURDY RED WINE
gP-a7pUorgo_7 0 THE REASON THAT ALL WINE CAN HAVE BUBBLES IN IT IS OF COURSE THAT CARBON DIOXIDE IS A BYPRODUCT OF FERMENTATION
gP-a7pUorgo_8 0 WHEN THE YEAST IS HITTING THE SUGAR AND MAKING ALCOHOL IT'S ALSO CREATING CO2 AND EVEN IF THE CO2 IS NOT PURPOSELY CAPTURED IN THE GLASS A LITTLE BIT REMAINS IN THE WINE AND WILL REMAIN IN THE BOTTLE AND WILL REMAIN IN YOUR WINE GLASS
gP-a7pUorgo_9 0 YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO SEE IT BUT YOU'LL DEFINITELY BE ABLE TO TASTE IT
gP-a7pUorgo_10 0 A LITTLE BIT OF CARBON DIOXIDE WILL MAKE A WINE TASTE FRESH AND INTERESTING AND WILL MOVE THE WINE AROUND IN YOUR MOUTH TO ALLOW YOU TO TASTE MORE AND MORE OF IT
gP-a7pUorgo_11 0 IF YOU'VE EVER TASTED FLAT COKE I HOPE IT WAS AN ACCIDENT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE FLAT COKE DOESN'T TASTE GOOD AT ALL
gP-a7pUorgo_12 0 FLAT COCA-COLA FLAT PEPSI DOESN'T MATTER IT TASTES BAD BUT WE ALL LOVE THE FLAVOR OF GOOD SODA
gP-a7pUorgo_13 0 WE LOVE COKE AND PEPSI AND EVERYTHING
gP-a7pUorgo_14 0 THE DIFFERENCE IS CARBON DIOXIDE
gP-a7pUorgo_15 0 THAT'S AN EXTREME EXAMPLE BUT THAT'S THE LIVELINESS THE FRESHNESS AND THE CRISP ACIDITY THAT CO2 WILL GIVE TO A BEVERAGE AND THERE'S A LITTLE BIT IN YOUR WINE WHETHER YOU SEE IT OR NOT
gP-a7pUorgo_16 0 YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO NOTICE IT EVEN IN YOUR STURDY CABERNET OR YOUR SOLID SAUVIGNON BLANC SO TAKE A LOOK AT IT
gP-a7pUorgo_17 0 SEE IF YOU SEE SOME BUBBLES BEFORE YOU TASTE THAT WINE
gEOHN9Y1QCo_1 0 THE LAST THING I WANT AND TRY TO DO I STILL WANT TO CREATIVE SOME MORE SEPARATION IN THAT ONE DARK AREA BEHIND THE NECK IS A LITTLE FRUSTRATING TO ME
gEOHN9Y1QCo_2 0 SO I HAVE SET UP ANOTHER LAMP ANOTHER HOUSEHOLD LAMP BACK BEHIND THIS THING
gEOHN9Y1QCo_3 0 LET'S TURN IT ON AND SEE WHAT WE GET
gEOHN9Y1QCo_4 0 NOW WHAT HAS THAT DONE FOR US
gEOHN9Y1QCo_5 0 HAS THAT ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE NEEDED IT TO DO
gEOHN9Y1QCo_6 0 IT'S CERTAINLY CREATING MORE SEPARATION
gEOHN9Y1QCo_7 0 WE'VE GOT A GOOD BRIGHT LIGHT BEHIND IT
gEOHN9Y1QCo_8 0 IT'S A WARMER LIGHT THAT PARTICULAR LIGHT BACK THERE IS CONDESCEND COMPARED TO THE FLORESCENT THAT'S DOWN IN THIS CORNER
gEOHN9Y1QCo_9 0 SO WE'VE GOT SOME COLORS SHIFTS GOING ON THAT IS PRETTY INTERESTING
gEOHN9Y1QCo_10 0 IT'S BEHIND THERE
gEOHN9Y1QCo_11 0 IT'S SOFTENED THAT NECK SHADOW AND I THINK I MIGHT WANT TO MOVE IT SO THAT IT GETS RID OF MORE OF THAT NECK SHADOW
gEOHN9Y1QCo_12 0 SO IF YOU EXCUSE ME A MOMENT I'M GOING TO DISAPPEAR TEMPORARY
gEOHN9Y1QCo_13 0 IS THAT BECOME VISIBLE
gEOHN9Y1QCo_14 0 HOW IS THAT LOOKING FROM WHERE YOU'RE SEEING IT
gEOHN9Y1QCo_15 0 CAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING
gEOHN9Y1QCo_16 0 THAT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD
gEOHN9Y1QCo_17 0 THAT LOOKS REAL GOOD
gEOHN9Y1QCo_18 0 I'VE GOTTEN IT A LITTLE BIT LOW CAUSE I'M SEEING HAIR OF THAT BULB THROUGH THERE BUT I THINK THAT WHERE VERY CLOSE TO WANT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY START TAKING THE FIRST PHOTOGRAPH
gEOHN9Y1QCo_19 0 I MAY HAVE PUT THAT ANGLE TO MUCH
gEOHN9Y1QCo_20 0 I DON'T WANT IT TO BE A SHARP SHAPE LIKE THAT BUT IT'S WORKING CLOSE AND IT'S JUST MOVING BACK AND FORTH
gEOHN9Y1QCo_21 0 SEEING WHAT WE HAVE MEASURING IT AGAINST WHAT WE'RE GETTING WITH OUR EYES FROM THE POSITION OF THE CAMERA UNTIL WE'RE SATISFIED WITH THE COMPOSITION IN A WAY THAT IT'S LIT AND THAT LOOKS VERY GOOD
gEOHN9Y1QCo_22 0 I THINK THE CLIENT MY BOARD IN THIS CASE WILL BE PRETTY IMPRESSED
gEOHN9Y1QCo_23 0 THEY WILL BE HAPPY
gEOHN9Y1QCo_24 0 EVERY PRODUCT IS DIFFERENT
gEOHN9Y1QCo_25 0 THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT SHAPES
gEOHN9Y1QCo_26 0 THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT APPROACHES BUT THE APPROACH TO TRY TO LIGHT IT IS BASICALLY THE SAME
gEOHN9Y1QCo_27 0 LIGHT THE OBJECT FIRST PRIMARY SURFACES DETERMINE RATHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE REFLECTIONS OR RATHER YOU WANT TO CONCENTRATE ON THE OVERALL SHAPE
gEOHN9Y1QCo_28 0 LIGHT IT SO EVERYTHING IS VISIBLE AND THEN COME BACK IN AND USE OTHER LIGHTS TO USE TO CREATE HIGHLIGHTS DRAMA DIFFUSION SO THAT YOU NOT SEEING DISTRACTING REFLECTIONS OR REFRACTIONS ON THE SURFACE OF THE INSTRUMENTS AND THEN COME UP WITH A LIGHTING SYSTEM THAT WORKS TO HELP SEPARATE IT FROM THE BACKGROUND AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET SOME PRETTY INTERESTING PRODUCT SHOTS
H3FoUeNGIPc_1 0 ALRIGHT THE DRINK WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE IS CALLED FLASH GORDON
H3FoUeNGIPc_2 0 LET'S PUT SOME ICE IN A GLASS AND MEASURE OUT TWO SHOTS OF DRY GIN PREFERABLY GORDON'S DRY GIN HENCE THE FLASH GORDON BUT ANY GIN WILL DO

HhDUU5s2IsM_2 0 TO COME INTO THIS POSE I LIKE TO START FROM HEROS POSE
HhDUU5s2IsM_3 0 YOU ARE GOING TO PLACE YOUR HANDS UNDER YOUR SHOULDERS AND ADJUST YOUR KNEES TO WHERE THEY ARE JUST UNDERNEATH YOUR HIPS

HhDUU5s2IsM_7 0 I'M JUST RAISING MY GAZE AND LIFTING THE HEART
HhDUU5s2IsM_8 0 SPINNING THOSE SITZ BONES UP TO THE CEILING AND DROPPING THE BELLY DOWN
HhDUU5s2IsM_9 0 AS I EXHALE I'M GOING TO COME BACK TO MY TABLE TOP
HhDUU5s2IsM_10 0 INHALING AND EXHALING
HhDUU5s2IsM_11 0 TRY A FEW REPETITIONS
HhDUU5s2IsM_12 0 ANYWHERE FROM FIVE FIVE TO TEN TEN AND SEE HOW YOU FEEL
gFlUECHB2qo_1 0 NOW WE'RE READY TO MOVE ONTO ROMAN NUMERAL FOUR
gFlUECHB2qo_2 0 DIALOG AND A CAPITOL A IS ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OTHER THAN DRAMATIC ACTION
gFlUECHB2qo_3 0 AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS BASICALLY I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE DIALOG FACILITATES THE DRAMATIC ACTION
gFlUECHB2qo_4 0 BUT IS THERE ANY OTHER PURPOSE IN THE DIALOG THAN THE DRAMATIC ACTION
gFlUECHB2qo_5 0 NOW THIS IS WHERE WE MIGHT TALK ABOUT THERE ARE CERTAIN COLLOQUIALISMS THERE ARE CERTAIN SLANG TERMINOLOGY TO FACILITATE THE PLAY OR FACILITATE A CERTAIN FEELING ABOUT THE PLAY
gFlUECHB2qo_6 0 PERHAPS THERE IS A RHYTHM A MELODY A STYLE OF WRITING THAT WHERE THE PLAYWRITE IS TRYING TO MAKE A STATEMENT WITH A PARTICULAR STYLE WITH A PARTICULAR RHYTHM WITH A PARTICULAR SET OF LANGUAGE OR SLANG OR WORD CHOICE
gFlUECHB2qo_7 0 THAT'S WHERE YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT
gFlUECHB2qo_8 0 FOR EXAMPLE IN EQUUS THERE'S A LOT OF COLLOQUIALISMS THERE'S ALSO A RHYTHM TO THE WRITING OF THE PLAY
gFlUECHB2qo_9 0 SO THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE STYLE OF WRITING
GVoDS2IzVtE_1 0 WE ALSO CARRY A NON GLARE PLEXIGLASS
GVoDS2IzVtE_2 0 LIKE I SAID SOME OF THEM ARE HARDER TO DEAL WITH THAN OTHERS
GVoDS2IzVtE_3 0 THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT RIGHT HERE IS ONE OF THE HARDEST ONES THAT I FOUND TO DEAL WITH
GVoDS2IzVtE_4 0 THE PEELING TO THIS PRODUCT IS JUST AWFUL
GVoDS2IzVtE_5 0 IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT IT GOES BACK TO THE OLD SCHOOL THOUGHT THOUGH
GVoDS2IzVtE_6 0 THIRTY FORTY YEARS AGO WE WERE ALL TAUGHT NON GLARE GLASS IS THE BEST PRODUCT IN THE WORLD FOR YOUR PRODUCT SINCE THEN WE HAVE LEARNED OTHERWISE
GVoDS2IzVtE_7 0 THAT NON GLARE INVITES LIGHTING WHICH DAMAGES YOUR PLEXIGLASS GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT CLEAR PICTURE THAN THE GLASS NON GLARE THOUGHT
GVoDS2IzVtE_8 0 I CAN PUT THEM SIDE BY SIDE TO GIVE YOU A CLUE TO WHICH ONE IS MORE CLEAR
GVoDS2IzVtE_9 0 THEY BOTH HAVE A FUZZY EFFECT ON THEM IF I HAD TO DO NON GLARE I WOULD PROBABLY DO A PLEXI OVER THE GLASS IT'S A LITTLE MORE CLEAR AND IT GIVES YOU A BETTER LOOK IN YOUR PICTURE
GVoDS2IzVtE_10 0 BUT I REALLY SUGGEST THAT YOU DO NOT HANG A PICTURE WITH NON GLARE GLASS OR PLEXI IN A NON LIGHTED AREA
GVoDS2IzVtE_11 0 THIS PRODUCT WILL STILL INVITE LIGHT THROUGH AND INTO YOUR PICTURE WHICH WILL FADE YOUR PICTURE AND IT HAS NO UV PROPERTIES IN IT
GVoDS2IzVtE_12 0 IT'S JUST A GLAZING THOUGHT FOR YOUR PICTURE
GVoDS2IzVtE_13 0 THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE YOU CAN NOT CONVINCE THE NON GLARE IS NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO
HeiOS5o4TKM_1 0 HI THIS DAVID JACKEL ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT STUDYING SONG STRUCTURES
HeiOS5o4TKM_2 0 NOW AS YOU WRITE YOUR OWN SONGS YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR IDEAS IN WAYS TO BUILD THE STRUCTURES OF YOUR SONGS
HeiOS5o4TKM_3 0 THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO DOING THIS
HeiOS5o4TKM_4 0 I THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS YOU CAN DO IS STUDY OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK
HeiOS5o4TKM_5 0 MUCH LIKE PAINTER'S IN SCHOOL WILL STUDY THE PAINTINGS OF GREAT MASTERS AND LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT DETAILS AND DIFFERENT APPROACHES DONE
HeiOS5o4TKM_6 0 YOU WANT TO DO THE SAME THING AS YOU WRITE SONGS
HeiOS5o4TKM_7 0 WHEN YOU HAVE SOME TIME SIT DOWN WITH A RECORDING OR COUPLE OF RECORDINGS OF SONGS THAT YOU REALLY LIKE GET A NOTEBOOK LIKE THIS AND WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE SONG
HeiOS5o4TKM_8 0 START WITH THE INTRO WRITE DOWN HOW MANY MEASURES IT HAPPENS FOR WRITE DOWN THE VERSE WRITE DOWN HOW MANY VERSES THERE ARE WHEN THE CHORUS COMES IN WRITE DOWN THE BRIDGE WRITE DOWN THE SOLO
HeiOS5o4TKM_9 0 MAP OUT THE ENTIRE SONG AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT AFTERWARDS AND SAY OKAY WHAT DID THESE PEOPLE DO TO MAKE THE SONG SOUND LIKE IT DOES
HeiOS5o4TKM_10 0 ONCE YOU'VE TAKEN A LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLE'S SONGS THEN YOU CAN GO TO THE NEXT STEP AND THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WERE THAT SONGWRITER AND HOW YOU WOULD CHANGE THE STRUCTURE
HeiOS5o4TKM_11 0 BECAUSE YOU MAY HEAR A SONG THAT YOU REALLY LIKE BUT THEN YOU MAY THINK TO YOURSELF GOSH YOU KNOW WHAT IF I COULD I'D GO BACK AND MAKE THE SOLO HALF AS LONG IT'S TOO LONG THE OUT-TRO TAKES TOO LONG OR MAYBE WE WANT ANOTHER CHORUS HERE MAYBE WE CAN GET A TRANSITIONAL BRIDGE HERE
HeiOS5o4TKM_12 0 AS YOU START TO STUDY OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK AND LEARN THE TECHNIQUES THEY USED YOU'LL GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE READY TO START COMING UP WITH YOUR OWN TECHNIQUES AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T LOOK AT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE THEN YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO BE RESTRICTED TO YOUR INITIAL IDEAS
HeiOS5o4TKM_13 0 SO BY ALL MEANS EXPOSE YOURSELF TO AS MANY DIFFERENT SONGWRITING IDEAS AS YOU CAN
HeiOS5o4TKM_14 0 ONE LAST THING YOU CAN TRY TOO AFTER YOU'VE BEEN STUDYING SOMEONE'S SONG STRUCTURE IS TO TAKE A SONG THAT YOU'VE WRITTEN WRITE OUT THE STRUCTURE THE SAME WAY YOU DID THEIRS TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND SAY HUM WHAT IF I TRY WHAT THEY DID AND SWITCH YOUR SONG A LITTLE BIT THAT WAY
HeiOS5o4TKM_15 0 IT'S UNNATURAL IT'S NOT WHAT YOU WOULD INSTINCTIVELY DO BUT THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD UPON YOUR IDEAS IS TO BREAK WITH YOUR INITIAL INSTINCTS AND TRY NEW THINGS
GJ-fPbpUp3A_1 0 HI WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEA TODAY AND NOW I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE HOW TO BREW OOLONG TEA IN A TEA SACK LIKE SO
GJ-fPbpUp3A_2 0 THIS IS AN EMPTY TEA BAG AND SO YOU CAN JUST USE THIS EMPTY TEA BAG AND YOU CAN PUT ANY KIND OF TEA YOU WANT TO DRINK IN THIS TEA BAG SO IT IS A REALLY GREAT TEA BREWING IMPLEMENT AND I'M JUST GOING TO GRAB A TEASPOON HERE HERE'S A TEASPOON AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS GET ONE LEVEL TEASPOON OF OOLONG TEA THAT LOOKS ABOUT RIGHT AND THEN I'LL JUST PUT THAT IN THE TEA BAG LIKE SO AND THEN SHAKE IT AROUND A BIT AND GET IT DOWN TOWARDS THE BOTTOM PUT THAT IN THE MUG AND THEN I'LL JUST ADD HOT WATER TO THE CUP AND IT'S O'KAY IF THE TEA BAG GOES DOWN LIKE THAT IF YOU WANT IT WILL FLOAT RIGHT BACK UP TO THE TOP
GJ-fPbpUp3A_3 0 THIS CAN BREW LIKE THIS JUST LIKE THIS FOR THREE MINUTES
GJ-fPbpUp3A_4 0 NOW I'VE LET THE TEA BREW FOR THREE MINUTES AND NOW I AM GOING TO PULL THE TEA BAG OUT SO THAT THE TEA STOPS BREWING AND YOU CAN USE THE SPOON OR WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO GET THE TEA BAGS TO COME OUT AND THEN JUST GRAB IT LIKE SO AND THEN GET SOME OF THE EXCESS TEA OUT AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE TEA IS EXPANDED SO NOW TEA BAG IS QUITE FULL OF TEA AND THEN WE'LL JUST PUT THAT ASIDE AND THEN WE'LL ENJOY THIS CUP OF TEA HERE AND THEN I CAN USE THESE LEAVES AGAIN TO MAKE A SECOND CUP OF TEA AFTER I'VE HAD THIS TEA HERE SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BREWING OOLONG IN THE TEA SACK
GAxCAav1h6A_1 0 HI THIS IS PHILLIP TORIELLO AND THIS IS HOW TO TEACH A CHILD BACK FLOAT
GAxCAav1h6A_2 0 THIS IS MY FRIEND KYLE
GAxCAav1h6A_3 0 HI WE GOTTA GO LIKE THIS GO HI
GAxCAav1h6A_6 0 THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO WHEN WORKING WITH A CHILD IN BACK FLOAT IS TO REALLY CHECK TO SEE HOW COMFORTABLE THEY ARE IN THE WATER
GAxCAav1h6A_7 0 THE PLACE THAT I'D LIKE TO START WHEN DOING BACK FLOATS WITH CHILDREN KYLE'S AGE AND A LITTLE BIT YOUNGER IS TO GO AHEAD AND USE THE STEPS
GAxCAav1h6A_8 0 PREFERABLY THE FIRST STEP WHERE THE WATER IS ABOUT TWO TO THREE INCHES DEEP SO THEN THEY'RE SECURE AT ALL TIMES AND THEY CAN FEEL THEIR HEADS BEING SUPPORTED BY THE STAIR BELOW THEM
GAxCAav1h6A_9 0 SO WHAT WE LIKE TO ASK THEM TO DO IS WE LIKE TO ASK THEM TO PUT THEIR HEAD BACK LOOKING UP AT THE SKY
GAxCAav1h6A_10 0 YOU CAN ENTERTAIN THEM WITH BUMBLEBEES BIRDS AIRPLANES
GAxCAav1h6A_11 0 LOOK FOR SHOOTING STARS DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY AND JUST KIND OF STAYING COMFORTABLE
GAxCAav1h6A_12 0 SUPPORTING THEIR HEAD WITH YOUR SHOULDER AND THEN ASKING THEM ALSO TO PUT THEIR BELLY BUTTON UP IN THE SKY
GAxCAav1h6A_13 0 ONCE THEY BECOME MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT YOU CAN SLOWLY MOVE THEM OFF YOUR SHOULDER BUT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEM WITH THE HAND YOUR LEFT HAND
GAxCAav1h6A_14 0 AND AS YOU CAN SEE KYLE'S CHIN IS A LITTLE BIT FORWARD SO WE'RE GOING TO ASK HIM TO PUT HIS HEAD BACK A LITTLE BIT MORE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT

GAxCAav1h6A_17 0 SO NOW HE'S IN A REALLY GOOD POSITION
GAxCAav1h6A_18 0 I'M ALSO SUPPORTING HIS LOWER BACK RIGHT NOW TO HELP HIM FEEL SECURE
GAxCAav1h6A_19 0 WHAT YOU CAN ALSO DO IN ORDER TO HELP CHILDREN STAY SECURE IS PUT THEIR FEET ON SOME LANE LINES JUST KIND OF PUT IT THERE OR EVEN PUT IT IN ONE OF THE LITTLE FILTER WELLS OR ON A STAIR
GAxCAav1h6A_20 0 SO THEN HE'S SUPPORTING HIS OWN BODY
GAxCAav1h6A_21 0 I CAN REMOVE MY HAND FROM HIS LOWER BACK AND THEN I CAN COME UP HERE AND FOCUS MORE ON HIS HEAD
GAxCAav1h6A_22 0 THEN WHAT YOU CAN DO IS ONCE HE'S COMFORTABLE ARE YOU FEELING COMFORTABLE SIR
GAxCAav1h6A_23 0 YEP YOU FEELIN OKAY

GAxCAav1h6A_33 0 FOR ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE
GAxCAav1h6A_34 0 ARE YOU DOIN OKAY
GAxCAav1h6A_36 0 ONCE THEY BECOME COMFORTABLE WITH THAT THEN YOU CAN KIND OF MOVE AWAY FROM THE BODY A LITTLE BIT PULL YOUR CHEST AWAY
GAxCAav1h6A_37 0 AND WOULD YOU BE OKAY JUST FLOATING ON YOUR BACK HERE LIKE THIS
GAxCAav1h6A_39 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO LET HIM FLOAT FOR FIVE MORE SECONDS SO HE GETS A A FINER SENSE OF SECURITY IN SUPPORTING HIMSELF ON HIS BACK

GAxCAav1h6A_46 0 THANK YOU SIR
GAxCAav1h6A_47 0 AND THAT IS YOUR BACK FLOAT FOR CHILDREN
GAxCAav1h6A_48 0 ONE MORE TOOL THAT I LIKE TO USE IS THE NOODLE
GAxCAav1h6A_49 0 AND A FINE LITTLE TRICK WITH THIS IS TO ASK THE CHILD TO PUT THEIR HEAD BACK ALL THE WAY BACK ON THE NOODLE
GAxCAav1h6A_50 0 HE KEEPS HIS HEAD BACK AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO US USE THE CURRENT OF MY BODY TO HELP PULL HIM ACROSS THE POOL AND HE'LL BE FLOATING BY HIMSELF
GAxCAav1h6A_51 0 TO LEARN MORE ABOUT TEACHING A CHILD TO BACK FLOAT PLEASE CONTACT YOUR LOCAL SWIM INSTRUCTOR
hEbh6FYhshs_2 0 ANOTHER GREAT TIP FOR MAINTAINING A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS IS TO EXPRESS SIMILAR INTERESTS AND DO THINGS TOGETHER AND WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS SUPPORT FOR WHAT EACH OF YOU LIKE
hEbh6FYhshs_3 0 MAYBE SHE LIKES POTTERY OR THE BALLET AND YOU COULD CARE LESS ABOUT POTTERY OR THE BALLET YOU SHOULD STILL SHOW AN INTEREST IN THOSE THINGS BECAUSE SHE LIKES THEM THE SAME GOES FOR HER FOR FOOTBALL OR AUTO-MECHANICS OR MAYBE THE REVERSAL MAYBE HE LIKES BALLET AND SHE LIKES AUTO-MECHANICS EITHER WAY YOU SHOULD SUPPORT EACH OTHER INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS BUT YOU SHOULD ALSO FIND THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TOGETHER USUALLY IT'S THE EXTREME ONE OR THE OTHER WITHER WE DO EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND I'M JUST GOING TO LIKE EVERYTHING YOU LIKE OR I'M GOING TO DO MY THING YOU DO YOUR THING AND WHATEVER
hEbh6FYhshs_4 0 WELL IT SHOULD BE A BLEND OF BOTH GO DO YOUR THING BUT FIND THE THINGS YOU CAN DO TOGETHER YOU BOTH LIKE TO BIKE RIDE YOU BOTH LIKE TO RIDE MOTORCYCLES YOU BOTH LIKE TO GO SEE MOVIES WHATEVER IT IS BUT FIND A COMMON GROUND THAT YOU CAN ALSO SHARE TOGETHER
H2UtCY-gX_s_1 0 SO NOW THAT I GOT MY CYANOTYPE AND MY CONTACT PRINTER
H2UtCY-gX_s_2 0 I CAN MAKE A CYANOTYPE IMAGE
H2UtCY-gX_s_3 0 NOW YOU SEE I'M DOING THIS AGAIN WITH A CUT DOWN 4X5 NEGATIVE ON TOP OF PAPER THAT'S BEEN SENSITIZED
H2UtCY-gX_s_4 0 THIS IS A VERY TRADITIONAL WAY OF MAKING A CYANOTYPE
H2UtCY-gX_s_5 0 NOW AGAIN THERE'S ALL THESE LEAVES IN MY BACK YARD HERE THERE'S ALL KINDS OF LITTLE COLLAGES CHINCOLET DO AND I I'M GOING TO DO THAT IN A LITTLE BIT TOO
H2UtCY-gX_s_6 0 BUT RIGHT NOW YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS IMAGE IS TURNING BLUE
H2UtCY-gX_s_7 0 WHAT IT'S DOING IS IT'S OXIDIZING FROM THE SUN AND IT'S ACTUALLY EXPOSING AS I SPEAK
H2UtCY-gX_s_8 0 IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING TO SEE IT TURNING FROM THAT BLUE TO A GRAY-BLUE TO A BROWN-BLUE
H2UtCY-gX_s_9 0 NOW IN MY EXPERIENCE OF BEING OUTSIDE WITH THIS TYPE OF CLOUDS AND SUN IT USUALLY TAKES ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES FOR A NICE NEGATIVE TO EXPOSE
H2UtCY-gX_s_10 0 SO THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY TODAY OUT HERE I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TWENTY MINUTES
H2UtCY-gX_s_11 0 NOW I'VE BEEN PRINTING FOR A LONG TIME AND ONE WAY I GET AROUND TODAY'S A BIG PRINTING DAY FOR ME YOU KNOW I BEEN WORKING ALL WEEK I GOT ONE DAY TO PRINT
H2UtCY-gX_s_12 0 SO WHAT I DID IS I MADE A UV LIGHT SOURCE AND WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO THAT IN THE NEXT COUPLE EPISODES AND HOW YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN
H2UtCY-gX_s_13 0 IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG TANNING BED THAT YOU CAN PRINT THESE EVEN AT NIGHT
H2UtCY-gX_s_14 0 THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CYANOTYPES THAT I REALLY LOVE JUST BEING ABLE TO DO THEM IN THE BACK YARD AND HANG OUT PUT ON MY PICNIC TABLE TWENTY MINUTES WALK AWAY AND COME BACK WE'LL SEE WHAT WE GET
gtW7SGvkkoI_1 0 HI I AM NATALJA FROM THE RED BRICK CAFE
gtW7SGvkkoI_2 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE WE ARE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO PROPERLY MAKE POPLAR GOURMET COFFEE HOUSE DRINKS
gtW7SGvkkoI_3 0 SO NOW WE ARE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE AN ICED AMERICANO
gtW7SGvkkoI_4 0 ICED AMERICANO IS VERY SIMILAR TO ICED LATTE EXCEPT IT DOESN'T HAVE THE MILK OR CREAM IN IT
gtW7SGvkkoI_5 0 THE TRICK HERE TO MAKE A REALLY GOOD ICED AMERICANO IS TO HAVE LOT OF ICE AND NOT TOO MUCH WATER
gtW7SGvkkoI_6 0 THE FIRST THING WE WANT TO DO IS ACTUALLY POUR OUR SHOT
gtW7SGvkkoI_7 0 WE ARE GOING TO DO IT IN THIS SMALL POURER HERE
gtW7SGvkkoI_8 0 IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE ANY FLAVORING OR SUGAR YOU SHOULD PUT IT INTO THE POURER AND HAVE GO WITH THE SHOT SO IT BLENDS BETTER
gtW7SGvkkoI_9 0 I AM ACTUALLY GOING TO USE SUGAR BECAUSE IT DRAWS OUT THE FLAVOR
gtW7SGvkkoI_10 0 BECAUSE IT IS A DOUBLE SHOT I AM GOING TO USE TWO TABLESPOONS OF SUGAR
gtW7SGvkkoI_11 0 IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE A REALLY PERFECT ESPRESSO WHEN YOU HAVE DRINKS THAT DON'T HAVE CREAMED MILK OR ANY SYRUPS IN IT BECAUSE YOU ARE REALLY GOING TO TASTE THE ESPRESSO
gtW7SGvkkoI_12 0 YOU WANT TO HAVE IT VERY GOOD TASTING
gtW7SGvkkoI_13 0 SO I AM GOING TO PUT THE POURER OVER HERE AND PULL A DOUBLE SHOT
gtW7SGvkkoI_14 0 THE NEXT THING I AM GOING TO DO IS I AM GOING TO FILL UP MY MUG WITH ICE
gtW7SGvkkoI_15 0 THERE YOU GO
gtW7SGvkkoI_16 0 PUT IN A LOT OF ICE
gtW7SGvkkoI_17 0 GOING TO WAIT FOR OUR SHOT
gtW7SGvkkoI_18 0 THE NEXT STEP IS STIR IT IF YOU HAVE ANY FLAVORING OR SUGAR WHICH I DO
gtW7SGvkkoI_19 0 STIR THAT WELL IN
gtW7SGvkkoI_20 0 THEN I AM GOING TO SLOWLY POUR IT OVER THE ICE TO MELT IT
gtW7SGvkkoI_21 0 AS YOU CAN SEE IT REALLY MELTS THE ICE RIGHT AWAY
gtW7SGvkkoI_22 0 NOW I AM GOING TO ADD SOME WATER
gtW7SGvkkoI_23 0 I LIKE TO POUR THE WATER INTO THE POURER
gtW7SGvkkoI_24 0 I AM ONLY GOING TO PUT 3/4 OF A POURER BECAUSE IF YOU PUT TOO MUCH WATER IT IS GOING TO TASTE DILUTED
gtW7SGvkkoI_25 0 GET ALL THE LEFT OVER SUGAR AND THE GOOD STUFF BLEND IT IN THE WATER POUR IT IN
gtW7SGvkkoI_26 0 NOW WHAT I LIKE TO DO AT THIS POINT IS ADD A LITTLE MORE ICE
gtW7SGvkkoI_27 0 THIS SHOULD BE PROBABLY GOOD
gtW7SGvkkoI_28 0 NOW THAT IS THE BARE MINIMUM ICED AMERICAN
gtW7SGvkkoI_29 0 IF YOU CUSTOMER WANTS TO ADD CREAM OR MILK THEY WILL HAVE ROOM TO PUT IT IN
gtW7SGvkkoI_30 0 SO THAT'S GOOD NOT TO ACTUALLY NOT FILL IT UP
gtW7SGvkkoI_31 0 THERE YOU GO
gtW7SGvkkoI_32 0 THAT'S AN ICED AMERICANO
h6IQn8pgGeY_1 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE MAKING A CHICKEN DISH

h6IQn8pgGeY_6 0 AND WHILE WE'RE DOING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING ROASTED ONION AND ROASTED GARLIC THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE DO WE'RE PUT THOSE IN THE OVEN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THOSE OUT AND WE'RE GOING TO BLEND THEM WITH SOME ORANGE JUICE AND SOME OREGANO ALSO WITH SOME SALT AND PEPPER
h6IQn8pgGeY_7 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING A GUAJILLO GUAJILLO PEPPER AND WE'RE GOING TO BLANCH THAT

GILCH6UAez4_4 0 WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE TRIKE BUGGY AND PPG TRIKING WITH PARAGLIDERS
GILCH6UAez4_5 0 SO IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO LAY OUT THE GLIDER AND PREPARE IT FOR ATTACHING TO THE TRIKE BUGGY
GILCH6UAez4_6 0 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE WING OUT OF THE STUFFED SACK
GILCH6UAez4_7 0 WE WANT TO ORIENT THE WING INTO WHATEVER WIND NO MATTER HOW SMALL WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE WING IS POINTED RIGHT INTO THE WIND
GILCH6UAez4_8 0 IN THIS CASE IT HAPPENS TO BE POINTING RIGHT INTO THE SUN SO IT'S PRETTY EASY TO TELL THAT
GILCH6UAez4_9 0 KEEP THE LINES OUT HERE
GILCH6UAez4_10 0 WE DON'T WANT TO GET ANY OF THESE LINES THROUGH OR WE'VE CAUSED OURSELVES KNOTS
GILCH6UAez4_11 0 SO LAY THAT OUT
GILCH6UAez4_12 0 FIND THE CENTER OF THE WING PUT IT DIRECTLY DOWNWIND OF THE BUGGY WORKING ALONG THE LEADING EDGE
GILCH6UAez4_13 0 WE'RE GOING TO LAY THE LEADING EDGE OF THE GLIDER IN A NICE ARC FROM ONE SIDE AND THE SAME THING ON THE OTHER SIDE
GILCH6UAez4_14 0 THE REASON WE DO THAT IS IF WE PULL THE TIP WE COULD EASILY CAUSE A CRAVAT IN THE GLIDER WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT SO WE START ALONG THIS LEADING EDGE LAYING THE GLIDER OUT WITHOUT ANY LINES OVER
GILCH6UAez4_15 0 YOU CAN SEE A VERY CLEAN LEADING EDGE HERE
GILCH6UAez4_16 0 AT THAT POINT WE WANT TO COME BACK AND JUST CLEAR EACH OF THE RISERS
GILCH6UAez4_17 0 PRIMARILY WE'RE GOING TO CLEAR THE A LINES GOING TO THE FRONT OF THE WING HERE AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE CLEAN
GILCH6UAez4_18 0 IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A BREEZE YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE THE WIND TO HELP YOU LAY OUT THE GLIDER BY GENTLY INFLATING IT AND SETTING IT DOWN
GILCH6UAez4_19 0 IT'S A PERFECT LAYOUT RIGHT THERE AND WE'RE READY TO ATTACH THE TRIKE
GlCP-x3YvYI_1 0 HI I'M GRETCHEN SOARES AND WELCOME TO EXPERT VILLAGE

Gqd8r4WCpM0_1 0 JASON SHERIDAN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS JASON SHERIDAN FROM THE SHERIDAN FENCING ACADEMY HERE IN NEW YORK CITY AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO DEMONSTRATE SOME INTERMEDIATE SABRE FENCING
Gqd8r4WCpM0_2 0 WE HAVE OF COURSE THE SABRE IN HER RIGHT HAND HER GLOVE HER LAME WHICH IS FOR SCORING

Gqd8r4WCpM0_7 0 IF YOU GET A BIGGER VIEW YOU'LL ALSO SEE SHE'S WEARING HER PANTS KNICKERS AND FENCING SNEAKERS FENCING SHOES AS WELL
Gqd8r4WCpM0_8 0 ALL OF THIS PROVIDE PROTECTION AS WELL AS IT ALLOWS FOR ELECTRIC SCORING
Gqd8r4WCpM0_9 0 THE LAME HERE ISN'T FOR ANY PROTECTION THOUGH THE JACKET IS
Gqd8r4WCpM0_10 0 THE LAME IS JUST FOR SCORING AND OF COURSE THE WIRE IS JUST FOR SCORING
Gqd8r4WCpM0_11 0 IF YOU SEE INSIDE THE GUARD THERE IS PLUG TO WHICH THE WIRE PLUGS IN VERY NICELY ALLOWING THE ELECTRICAL BOX TO SCORE AND TO REGISTER WHO GETS THE HIT
HcXjjA9Fcxw_1 0 ALRIGHT AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WITH DECORATING NOW
HcXjjA9Fcxw_2 0 WE'VE GOT OUR SHELL BORDER GLUED ON AND THERE'S REALLY NO LIMIT TO WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THIS
HcXjjA9Fcxw_3 0 IF YOU'RE REALLY IN TO MONOCHROMATIC COLORS WE'VE GOT PINK AND BLUE HERE YOU CAN EVEN PAINT YOUR SHELLS

HcXjjA9Fcxw_14 0 AND THEN I'M GOING TO LEAVE THE REST OF THOSE JUST LIKE SO
GJczM8S_qLY_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M LAURA BANFORD
GJczM8S_qLY_2 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE SUPER LASAGNA AND CAESAR SALAD
GJczM8S_qLY_3 0 NOW THAT WE'VE DICED UP OUR ONIONS AND OUR GARLIC WE'RE GOING TO DICE UP OUR CARROTS
GJczM8S_qLY_4 0 CARROTS ADD AN IMPORTANT BALANCE TO TOMATO SAUCE A RED SAUCE HAS A LOT OF ACID AND CARROTS BALANCE THAT OUT WITH THERE ADHERENT SWEETNESS
GJczM8S_qLY_5 0 WE HAVE A COUPLE OF CARROTS REGULAR OLD CARROTS THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE ANYTHING FANCY THEY ALL DO THE SAME THING
GJczM8S_qLY_6 0 IF I WAS MAKING CARROTS AS A SIDE DISH I GO FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT IS CALLED NANTSE CARROT THAT IS A LITTLE FRENCH CARROTS THAT IS JUST BEAUTIFUL
GJczM8S_qLY_7 0 MAYBE A BONEFIED BABY CARROT NOT THOSE BAG CARROTS THAT ARE CUT TO THERE REALLY BIG CARROTS CUT SMALL TO LOOK LIKE BABY CARROTS
GJczM8S_qLY_8 0 BUT ACTUAL BABY CARROTS WITH THE TOPS ON THEM MAKE A REALLY NICE SIDE DISH YOU SAUTE THEM WITH A LITTLE OLIVE OIL BUTTER AND HONEY
GJczM8S_qLY_9 0 BUT FOR THIS PURPOSE THE CARROTS ARE GOING TO LEND THERE SWEETNESS TO A RED SAUCE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE
GJczM8S_qLY_10 0 I'M JUST PEELING THE THIN SKIN OFF THE VEGETABLE PEELER IS USEFUL FOR THIS AS OPPOSE TO A PAIRING KNIFE BECAUSE YOU SEE HOW THIN THE SKIN IS AND HOW EASILY IT JUST COMES RIGHT OFF WITHOUT SACRIFICING ANY OF THE CARROTS
GJczM8S_qLY_11 0 WE'LL GET OUR SKIN OFF THERE AND WE WANT KIND OF A UNIFORM DICE AS I SAID CAUSE WE WANT THEM TO COOK THE SAME RATE SO I'M JUST GOING TO CUT THEM INTO MANAGEABLE PIECES SO THEY'RE NOT ROLLING AROUND MY CUTTING BOARD
GJczM8S_qLY_12 0 THEN WE CAN DICE THEM UP KEEPING YOUR FINGERS OUT OF THE WAY OF COURSE LET'S DO IT AGAIN WITH THIS ONE
GJczM8S_qLY_13 0 AFTER WE FINISH WITH PREPPING THESE CARROTS WE'RE READY TO START COOKING AND WE'RE GOING TO START BY SAUTING OUR SAUSAGE IN SOME BUTTER AND OLIVE OIL SEE YOU THEN
gwmAYPMpAx4_1 0 IF YOU'VE EVER EMBARKED UPON A PROFESSIONALLY RUN WEIGHT LOSS OR EXERCISE PROGRAM IT'S MOST LIKELY THE FIRST THING THAT YOU WERE TOLD YOU NEEDED TO GET WAS A HEART RATE MONITOR
gwmAYPMpAx4_2 0 THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STYLES AND TYPES OF HEART RATE MONITORS AND BASICALLY THE FUNCTION IS THE SAME
gwmAYPMpAx4_3 0 IT'S TO TAKE A RUNNING TALLY OF WHAT YOUR HEART RATE IS AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT AND TO HELP YOU WORK UP TOWARDS YOUR TARGET HEART RATE AND NOT EXCEED YOUR MAXIMUM HEART RATE
gwmAYPMpAx4_4 0 I THINK THAT JUST FOR THE LAYMAN A HEART RATE MONITOR IS NOT SUCH A TERRIBLE THING TO HAVE AS IT CAN HELP MAKE YOUR OWN WORKOUT AND WEIGHT LOSS EFFORTS MORE EFFICIENT WHETHER YOU'RE PART OF A PROFESSIONAL PROGRAM OR NOT
gwmAYPMpAx4_5 0 HEART RATE MONITORS START AT ABOUT FIFTY OR SIXTY DOLLARS AND WORK UP TO TWO OR THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR SOME OF THE SMALLER NON WORK OUT FINGER TIP VARIETIES
gwmAYPMpAx4_6 0 AND REALLY IT'S A MATTER OF WHAT'S GOING TO BE COMFORTABLE FOR YOU AND WHAT PURPOSES YOU'RE LOOKING TO USE THE HEART RATE MONITOR FOR
gwmAYPMpAx4_7 0 A WORK OUT ORIENTED ONE OF COURSE IS FOR WORKING OUT
gwmAYPMpAx4_8 0 AND IF YOU JUST NEED ONE TO KEEP AND EYE ON HEART RATE FOR A DIFFERENT MEDICAL REASON AT HOME IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE LOGICAL TO SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GET A FINGER TIP MONITOR
gM3izByOIUI_1 0 NOW I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LASER PRINTERS
gM3izByOIUI_2 0 THIS IS JUST A STANDARD HOME OR SMALL OFFICE LASER PRINTER THAT PRETTY MUCH ANYBODY CAN GO AHEAD AND GET
gM3izByOIUI_3 0 NOW THERE'S SEVERAL COMPONENTS ON IT
gM3izByOIUI_4 0 OF COURSE I HAVE MY PAPER FEED BACK HERE
gM3izByOIUI_5 0 I HAVE TWO DIFFERENT TRAYS ACTUALLY FOR IF I WANTED TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PAPER
gM3izByOIUI_6 0 SO I COULD HAVE MY STANDARD PAPER HERE AND MAYBE ENVELOPES OR MAYBE EVEN A DIFFERENT COLOR PAPER UP HERE OR A DIFFERENT THICKNESS SUCH AS SOME TYPE OF CARDBOARD OR WHATNOT
gM3izByOIUI_7 0 SO WHAT WE HAVE WE HAVE A LITTLE LIFT BACK HERE WHICH CAN HOLD THE PAPER UP OF COURSE TOO
gM3izByOIUI_8 0 AND WE HAVE A LIFT UP HERE THAT WILL HOLD THE PAPER WHEN IT ACTUALLY COMES OUT AFTER BEING PRINTED
gM3izByOIUI_9 0 SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND CLOSE THAT THOUGH
gM3izByOIUI_10 0 IN THE EVENT OF A PAPER JAM THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS YOU CAN DO
gM3izByOIUI_11 0 ON THIS PARTICULAR UNIT WHICH MOST OF THEM HAVE THEY'LL HAVE A TRAY ON THE BOTTOM WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO PULL PAPER OUT IF SOMETHING DOES GET STUCK
gM3izByOIUI_12 0 SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND CLOSE THAT BACK UP
gM3izByOIUI_13 0 SO NOW REMEMBER A LASER PRINTER ACTUALLY DOES USE A TYPE OF LASER TO BURN THE IMAGE WHATEVER IT IS USUALLY TEXT ONTO THE PAPER
gM3izByOIUI_14 0 IT IS VERY VERY HOT AND IT IS NOT LIKE YOUR INK JET CARTRIDGES
gM3izByOIUI_15 0 SO ANYTHING THAT SAYS INK JET ONLY AS FAR AS PAPERS OR TRANSPARENCIES THINGS LIKE THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO USE IN A LASER PRINTER
gM3izByOIUI_16 0 I FOUND THIS OUT THE HARD WAY THE OTHER DAY TRYING TO USE A T-SHIRT TRANSFER PAPER INSIDE A LASER PRINTER AND I GOT THE GLUE EVERYWHERE
gM3izByOIUI_17 0 SO THAT SUCKED AND I HAD TO GO AHEAD AND CLEAN IT
gM3izByOIUI_18 0 SO JUST USE REGULAR COPY PAPER TO DO ANYTHING YOU'RE GOING TO BE PRINTING WITH YOUR LASER PRINTER
gM3izByOIUI_19 0 SO LET ME SHOW YOU IN THIS UNIT I CAN GO AHEAD AND PULL UP THE ENTIRE FRONT AND THEN WHAT YOU HAVE LASER PRINTERS ACTUALLY HAVE A THING CALLED THE TONER
gM3izByOIUI_20 0 SO THIS ONE HAS A GRIP YOU GO AHEAD AND YANK IT OUT
gM3izByOIUI_22 0 AND THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT BURNS THE IMAGE ONTO YOUR PAPER
gM3izByOIUI_23 0 SO THIS HAS THE INK BASICALLY THAT WILL BE IN HERE TO PUT THE IMAGE WHATEVER IT IS IF IT'S A PICTURE OR TEXT ONTO YOUR PAPER
gM3izByOIUI_24 0 SO IN THE EVENT YOU NOTICE THAT YOUR TONER ISN'T PRINTING CORRECTLY AND YOU HAVE SOME LETTERS MISSING OR IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE GO AHEAD AND GIVE YOUR TONER A SHAKE BEFORE GOING AHEAD AND REPLACING UM GO AHEAD AND EXCUSE ME TRYING TO BUY A NEW ONE
gM3izByOIUI_25 0 THESE ARE KIND OF EXPENSIVE BUT THEY DO LAST A LONG TIME
gM3izByOIUI_26 0 SO INSTEAD OF BUYING BLACK INK ALL THE TIME FOR YOUR INK JET PRINTER GO AHEAD AND GET YOURSELF A LASER PRINTER
gM3izByOIUI_27 0 SO ONCE YOU'RE DONE WHETHER IT'S A NEW ONE OR YOUR REPLACEMENT AFTER YOU'VE SHAKEN IT
gM3izByOIUI_28 0 YOU GO AHEAD AND LOCK IT BACK INTO PLACE
gM3izByOIUI_29 0 SO I HAVE SOME FANS HERE THAT KEEP EVERYTHING COOL
gM3izByOIUI_30 0 IT ACTUALLY SAYS THAT IT GOES UP TO 356 DEGREES SO THAT'S PRETTY HOT
gM3izByOIUI_31 0 SO ONCE YOU'RE DONE YOU GO AHEAD AND CLOSE THE DOOR
gM3izByOIUI_32 0 IT'LL DO IT'S LITTLE RUN THROUGH
gM3izByOIUI_33 0 MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S RIGHT
gM3izByOIUI_34 0 THE SAME WAY YOUR INK JET PRINTER WOULD CYCLE THROUGH AND MAKE SURE YOUR INK JET CARTRIDGES HAVE BEEN PLACED PROPERLY
gM3izByOIUI_35 0 SO THEN THERE'S A BUNCH OF INDICATOR LIGHTS ON THE SIDE TOO IF WE NEED TO LOAD PAPER IF THERE'S A JAM IF THERE'S AN ERROR OR WHATNOT
gM3izByOIUI_36 0 SO IT'S PRETTY SELF-EXPLANATORY
gM3izByOIUI_37 0 YOU GO AHEAD AND TURN IT ON PLUG IT INTO YOUR COMPUTER AND GO AHEAD AND PRINT
gM3izByOIUI_38 0 SO AND WHEN YOU REPLACE JUST A LITTLE POINT WHEN YOU'RE REPLACING YOUR TONER GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT TO A PROPER PLACE
gM3izByOIUI_39 0 THE TONERS ARE PRETTY TOXIC SO WHEN YOU BUY A NEW TONER THEY USUALLY HAVE A RETURN SHIPPING BOX ON THE INSIDE THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO SEND IT BACK TO THE MANUFACTURER
gM3izByOIUI_40 0 AND SOMETIMES THEY'LL GIVE YOU A CREDIT
gM3izByOIUI_41 0 EVEN IF THEY DON'T IT HELPS THE ENVIRONMENT SO GO AHEAD PRINT OUT WHAT YOU GOT TO PRINT AND ENJOY YOUR LASER PRINTER
H6w-P4QrTzc_1 0 DO YOU WORK IN A JOB WHICH REQUIRES YOU TO CONTINUOUSLY REPEAT THE SAME MOVEMENT ON YOUR WRISTS
H6w-P4QrTzc_2 0 IF YOU DO THEN YOU COULD BE SUBJECT TO CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME
H6w-P4QrTzc_4 0 I'M CINDY MASTRY AND I WANT TO SHOW YOU AN EXERCISE THAT CAN HELP YOU RELEASE TENSION IN THE WRISTS AND THE FOREARM
H6w-P4QrTzc_5 0 IN CASE YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT WORKS AT THE COMPUTER ALL THE TIME MAYBE DRIVES ALL THE TIME MAYBE YOU DO GARDENING MAYBE YOU'RE A MUSICIAN ANYTHING THAT YOU DO REPETITIVELY OVER AND OVER CAN CAUSE YOU TO HAVE CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME
H6w-P4QrTzc_6 0 SO THIS AREA RIGHT HERE IN YOUR WRIST IS THE CARPAL TUNNEL AND IT'S MADE UP OF THIS ARCH WAY AND EIGHT CARPAL BONES
H6w-P4QrTzc_7 0 SO IT'S WHEN THE MEDIAN NERVE GETS INFLAMED
H6w-P4QrTzc_8 0 SO IF WE TAKE OUR THUMB AND PRESS IT ACROSS YOUR WRIST JUST INHALE AND FLEX THE WRIST AND THEN EXHALE AND EXTEND THE WRIST
H6w-P4QrTzc_9 0 SO WE'RE JUST BRINGING SOME BLOOD FLOW TO YOUR WRIST STRETCHING CONTRACTING THE FOREARM TO BRING THE BLOOD FLOW TO RELIEVE CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME
H6w-P4QrTzc_10 0 THIS ALSO WORKS IF YOUR ARMS OR YOUR WRISTS GET TIRED IN A DOWNWARD FACING DOG
H6w-P4QrTzc_11 0 YOU CAN DO THIS ANYWHERE IN THE CAR AT YOUR DESK AT HOME
H6w-P4QrTzc_12 0 JUST ONE OF THE MANY THINGS YOU CAN DO TO RELIEVE CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME
gP6jtWPmOA8_2 0 I'M MICHAEL LAMENDOLA WITH EXPERTVILLAGE.COM AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO SHOOT SOME POOL
gP6jtWPmOA8_3 0 ALRIGHT THE NEXT GAME I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IS CALLED CUTTHROAT
gP6jtWPmOA8_4 0 NOW CUTTHROAT IS A GAME FOR THREE PLAYERS
gP6jtWPmOA8_5 0 SO IF YOU'VE GOT A THIRD PERSON THEY'RE NOT THE ODD MAN OUT
gP6jtWPmOA8_6 0 THERE'S ACTUALLY A GAME MADE FOR THAT ODD MAN
gP6jtWPmOA8_7 0 USUALLY I'M CONSIDERED THE ODD MAN BUT AGAIN THAT'S ANOTHER STORY FOR ANOTHER DAY
gP6jtWPmOA8_8 0 CUTTHROAT GOES LIKE THIS
gP6jtWPmOA8_9 0 YOU'VE GOT THE BALLS RACKED IN ANY ORDER YOU WANT
gP6jtWPmOA8_10 0 TIGHTEN THE RACK PERFECT
gP6jtWPmOA8_11 0 NOW MY BUDDIES HERE LOUIS AND JEFF ARE MY TWO OPPONENTS
gP6jtWPmOA8_12 0 NOW BEFORE THE GAME WE'RE GOING TO DECIDE WHO'S WHO
gP6jtWPmOA8_13 0 YOU DECIDE WHO'S WHO BY SAYING I'M GOING TO BE BALLS ONE FIVE SIX TEN OR ELEVEN FIFTEEN
gP6jtWPmOA8_14 0 IN THIS CASE I'LL BE ONE FIVE JEFF WILL THE SIX TEN AND LOUIS WILL BE ELEVEN FIFTEEN
gP6jtWPmOA8_15 0 LOUIS WILL BRING UP THE REAR
gP6jtWPmOA8_16 0 SO WE'VE GOT OUR BALLS AND NOW WE START TO PLAY
giW28nuSSiM_1 0 THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE IN ANY GIVEN CITY WHO CAN PLAY WHEELCHAIR BASKETBALL LEGALLY AND DON'T EVEN KNOW IT AND THEY WOULD LOVE IT
giW28nuSSiM_2 0 I'M ALWAYS RECRUITING AND I DON'T MEAN RECRUITING LIKE I'M HOPING SOMEBODY GETS IN A CAR WRECK AND BREAKS THEIR BACK AND THEY END UP IN A HOSPITAL
giW28nuSSiM_3 0 THOSE PEOPLE CAN OBVIOUSLY PLAY WHEELCHAIR BASKETBALL
giW28nuSSiM_4 0 THEY JUST NEED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN THEIR COMMUNITY BUT THERE MIGHT BE WHEN I'M IN A MALL OR GOING TO A MOVIE I'LL SEE AN AMPUTEE WITH A PROSTHETIC LEG WALKING DOWN THE HALLWAY
giW28nuSSiM_5 0 WELL I TRY AND CHASE HIM DOWN
giW28nuSSiM_6 0 I TRY TO SAY HEY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THIS OR IF YOU KNOW BUT YOU COULD PLAY WHEELCHAIR BASKETBALL AND THEY LOOK AT ME LIKE BUT IF I CAN GET THEM TO COME OUT AND GET THEM TO TRY AND GET THEM TO WATCH OUR TEAM AND GET THEM TO REALIZE WE TRAVEL AND WE HAVE FUN AND WE'RE SEMI-PROFESSIONAL SOMETIMES IT GETS IN THEIR BLOOD AND THEY'RE HOOKED FOR LIFE BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE RIGHT OUT THERE RIGHT NOW WHO CAN PLAY THIS GAME AND THEY JUST DON'T EVEN KNOW IT OR THINK THEY CAN'T BUT THEY OUGHT TO GIVE IT A SHOT
giW28nuSSiM_7 0 A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE DON'T THINK THEY CAN PLAY WHEELCHAIR BASKETBALL BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIVE IN A WHEELCHAIR
giW28nuSSiM_8 0 THAT'S NOT TRUE
giW28nuSSiM_9 0 NINE OF MY TWELVE TEAMMATES IN ATLANTA GEORGIA IN THE 1996 PARALYMPIC GAMES PUSHED THEIR WHEELCHAIRS INTO THE GYM AND THEN SAT IN IT
giW28nuSSiM_10 0 YES YOU HAVE TO HAVE POLIO OR YOU HAVE TO BE AN AMPUTEE OR YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR LOWER EXTREMITY BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN A WHEELCHAIR
giW28nuSSiM_11 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SEVERELY DISABLED OR PARALYZED COMPLETELY LIKE LIKE I AM
giW28nuSSiM_12 0 YOU JUST HAVE TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE LEGAL TO GET INTO WHEELCHAIR BASKETBALL AND PLAY AND THOSE ARE THE KIND OF PLAYERS THAT LOCAL TEAMS NEED BECAUSE THEY ARE THE KIND OF PLAYERS THAT MAKE YOUR TEAM THE TOP TEAMS IN THE COUNTRY
giW28nuSSiM_13 0 NOTHING AGAINST THE SEVERELY DISABLED FOLKS BUT IT TAKES THOSE MORE STRONGER BALANCED ABILITY IN THEIR LEGS KIND OF PLAYERS TO WIN A GAME
giW28nuSSiM_14 0 THEY'RE JUST STRONGER AND THEY'RE TALLER AND THEY'RE FASTER
gOVsnN8kKuw_1 0 WE MUST ACCESS THE WIRES BY REMOVING THE DASH PANEL AND TAPPING INTO ACCESSORY ONE ACCESSORY TWO IGNITION ONE AND IGNITION TWO AND STARTER POSITION
gOVsnN8kKuw_2 0 OF COURSE WHEN TAPPING INTO THOSE CIRCUITS WE MUST FUSE PROTECT THE CIRCUITS BEING TAPPED INTO AND MUST NOT EXCEED THE POWER RATING THAT THE VEHICLE EXCEEDS
gOVsnN8kKuw_3 0 OVER HERE WE HAVE THE RADIO
gOVsnN8kKuw_4 0 THE RADIO IN MOST VEHICLES WORK IN ACCESSORY POSITION
gOVsnN8kKuw_5 0 WHEN THE CAR IS CRANKED THE RADIO GOES UP
gOVsnN8kKuw_6 0 WHEN THE CAR TURNS BACK TO THE ACCESSORY POSITION THE RADIO STAYS OPERABLE
gOVsnN8kKuw_7 0 SAME THING WITH THE ACCESSORY CIRCUIT WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STARTED RELEASED BACK TO THE ACCESSORY AIR CONDITIONER AND BLOWER WILL WORK WINDOWS WILL GO UP AND DOWN AND IN SOME INSTANCES TURN SIGNALS WORK AND HORN HONK
gMoUt7T6rGc_1 0 AMANDA CLAIRE SO I FOUND A GOOD SPOT FOR THE SWITCH
gMoUt7T6rGc_2 0 IT ACTUALLY TURNS OUT IT'S GOING TO FIT PRETTY NICELY I THINK UNDERNEATH THE CIRCUIT BOARD HERE
gMoUt7T6rGc_3 0 BUT ONE LITTLE TRICKY THING WE'LL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IS IS HOW TO GET A HOLE CUT ON THIS THING BIG ENOUGH TO FIT THE SWITCH INTO AND IT'S A PRETTY BIG SWITCH
gMoUt7T6rGc_4 0 AND SO A DREMEL TOOL IS A GOOD THING TO USE FOR THAT
gMoUt7T6rGc_5 0 I'VE STARTED BY DRILLING SOME PILOT HOLES YOU CAN SEE I'VE DRILLED SOME PILOT HOLES INTO THE CASE HERE
gMoUt7T6rGc_6 0 SO I'M JUST GONNA KINDA KEEP USING THE DRILL AND MAYBE I HAVE TO USE A LITTLE SERRATED KNIFE OR SOMETHING
gMoUt7T6rGc_7 0 LIKE I SAY DREMEL TOOL IS REALLY GOOD FOR THIS BUT I JUST WANT TO GET A HOLE ON THIS THAT'S BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD THIS SWITCH I'M TRYING TO PUT IN BECAUSE I THINK IT'D BE A GOOD SPOT FOR IT
gMoUt7T6rGc_8 0 AND THEN ONCE THE SWITCH IS INSTALLED WE'LL GO AHEAD AND SOLDER OUR WIRES TO THE CONTACTS AND GET THAT BEND INSTALLED
GQsL3mTN3W4_2 0 MY NAME IS JEFF FIFFIE
GQsL3mTN3W4_3 0 TODAY I'LL BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO REMOVE AND REPLACE A WATER PUMP ON A MAZDA 626
GQsL3mTN3W4_4 0 OF COURSE THE USE OF A JACK AND A JACK STAND IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY BEFORE WE CAN REMOVE THE MOTOR MOUNT
GQsL3mTN3W4_5 0 REPLACING THE JACK UNDERNEATH THE PAN IS THE BEST SPOT TO JACK UP YOUR ENGINE SO YOU DON'T PUT A HOLE IN THE PAN OIL PAN ITSELF
GQsL3mTN3W4_6 0 CHECKING THE HEIGHT OF YOUR ENGINE ITSELF
GQsL3mTN3W4_7 0 YOU WANT IT TO BE FLUSH
GQsL3mTN3W4_8 0 JUST ENOUGH TO TAKE OFF THE TENSION OFF OF THE BOLT AND THE MOUNT
GQsL3mTN3W4_9 0 JACKS AND JACK STANDS NEED TO BE PLACED UNDERNEATH JUST TO SECURE THE VEHICLE SO IT DOESN'T FALL AND TUMBLE ON YOU
GQsL3mTN3W4_10 0 YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REMOVE THE TIRE OFF THE CAR ITSELF
GQsL3mTN3W4_11 0 AFTER THE VEHICLE IS SECURE WITH THE STANDS OFF THE GROUND REMOVE LUG NUTS AND REMOVE THE TIRE
GQsL3mTN3W4_12 0 I LIKE TO SET THE TIRE UNDERNEATH THE FRAME ITSELF SO IF SOMEONE BUMPS INTO THE CAR AND KNOCKS IT OFF THE STANDS IT WILL FALL ON THE TIRE ITSELF AND THEN THE CAR DOESN'T FALL ON THE GROUND
H4HcC6deUEQ_1 0 WELL THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO TAKE THE BOWL OFF THE CUISINART AND TAKE IT OVER TO THE BOWL YOU HAVE THE MOZZARELLA IN AND REMOVE ALL OF THE CHEESE WHICH IS NOW SLIGHTLY TINTED GREEN FROM THAT FRESH BASIL WHICH IS REALLY GREAT AND THEN OUR NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO PUT IT ON OUR BAGUETTE SLICES WHICH ARE ARE CRUSTINIS I PUT IT ON FAIRLY THICK LIKE THIS MOUNDING IT AND GETTING IT ABSOLUTELY TO EVERY INCH OF THE BAGUETTE
H4HcC6deUEQ_2 0 AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH HOW YOU DO IT
H4HcC6deUEQ_3 0 JUST SIMILARLY I'VE GOT A TINY BAKING SHEET READY AND WHEN THESE ARE ALL FINISHED WHEN YOU'VE DONE ALL OF THESE THEN WE PUT ON A SLICE OF SUN-DRIED TOMATO ACROSS AT AN ANGLE LIKE THAT SO THAT IT LOOKS REALLY PRETTY
H4HcC6deUEQ_4 0 AND I DO THEM ALL THE SAME BECAUSE YOU'LL SEE WHEN WE ARRANGE IT ALL ON A PLATTER THAT IT WILL BE BEAUTIFUL
H4HcC6deUEQ_5 0 NOW ONE THING THAT I DID NOT SAY ABOUT SUN-DRIED TOMATOES THEY GENERALLY COME IN A JAR LIKE THIS IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BRAND
H4HcC6deUEQ_6 0 THEY COME IN OIL AND WHAT I GENERALLY DO IS PUT THEM IN A SIEVE OF SOME KIND I SAVE THE OIL TO USE FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE BECAUSE ITS GOT A WONDERFUL FLAVOR OF SUN-DRIED TOMATOES AND WHEN I TAKE THEM OUT I SLICE THEM IN HALF BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY ALL YOU NEED FOR THIS HORS D'OEUVRE IS HALF ON TOP OF EACH LIKE THAT
H4HcC6deUEQ_7 0 SO I HAVE A WHOLE SMALL BOWL READY WITH ALL MY LITTLE HALVES I THINK I HAVE TWELVE THERE AFTER THAT WE PUT THEM IN THE OVEN FOR SEVEN MINUTES AT 350
H4HcC6deUEQ_8 0 THE TOMATO CHEESE CRUSTINIS HAVE JUST COME OUT OF THE OVEN DO YOU REMEMBER WE BAKED THEM AT 350 FOR FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES
H4HcC6deUEQ_9 0 SO I WOULD RECOMMEND SETTING A TIME AND CHECKING THEM AFTER FIVE MINUTES BECAUSE THE WAY THEY ARE NOW WHICH IS REALLY NICE AND PUFFY AND MELTED THEY'RE ALMOST ALMOST LIKE LITTLE PIZZAS
H4HcC6deUEQ_10 0 CHILDREN LIKE THESE AS WELL AS ADULTS AND IT REALLY MAKES A BEAUTIFUL PRESENTATION WHEN YOU TAKE JUST A LITTLE SPRIG OF THE FRESH BASIL THAT YOU HAVE LEFT OVER FROM WHAT YOU BOUGHT AND ARRANGE IT ON THE PLATTER IT LOOKS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND YEAH RUSTIC AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THEY ARE DELICIOUS ENJOY
Gwh4PCbTQGk_1 0 PEN AND INK IS ANOTHER METHOD OF MAKING MARKS AND AGAIN IT HAS SOME CHARACTERISTICS THAT CAN COME OUT WITH SOME INTERESTING TEXTURES
Gwh4PCbTQGk_2 0 THIS IS A CROW QUILL PEN YOU NEED TO GET IT AT AN ART STORE IT HAS A VERY SMALL NIB THESE USED TO BE YOU KNOW CUT OUT OF BIRD FEATHER WHICH IS WHY IT'S CALLED A QUILL PEN AND YOU USE IT WITH A BOTTLE OF INK
Gwh4PCbTQGk_3 0 INK COMES IN ALL COLORS NOW AND THIS MAKES YOU CAN HEAR IT SCRATCH
Gwh4PCbTQGk_4 0 THIS DOESN'T MAKE A VERY WIDE LINE BUT IT'S VERY GOOD AT MAKING VERY FINE HAIR LIKE LINES AND IT'S VERY GOOD FOR WHAT WE CALL CROSS-HATCHING
Gwh4PCbTQGk_5 0 YOU JUST KEEP BUILDING UP THE SURFACE WITH INK AND PEOPLE SOME PEOPLE FIND THIS TO BE A VERY VERY EXPRESSIVE TYPE OF MEDIUM
Gwh4PCbTQGk_6 0 THIS IS ANOTHER INK NIB AND THIS WILL GIVE YOU A MUCH THICKER AND A LITTLE BIT MORE FLUID BUT THESE DAYS WE DON'T REALLY THAT'S SORT OF THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY
Gwh4PCbTQGk_7 0 NOWADAYS WE HAVE FELT TIP MARKERS AND PENS AND NIBS AND ALL KINDS OF ITEMS
Gwh4PCbTQGk_8 0 WE'VE GOT THEM WRITTEN IN THE MICRONS AND THIS AGAIN WILL GIVE YOU A VERY VERY FINE LINE
hK4Dwr5WR90_1 0 OKAY NOW THAT YOU'VE LEARNED THE THREE TURNS FOR MEN AND WOMEN IN PROFESSIONAL MODELING THE HALF TURN THE FULL TURN AND THE FADE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IN THESE NEXT CLIPS SOME COMBINATIONS THAT ARE HANDY TO USE WHEN YOU'RE ON A RAMP
hK4Dwr5WR90_2 0 FIRST OF ALL THE LADIES USING THE CATWALK AND THE HALF TURN
hK4Dwr5WR90_3 0 OVERLAP HALF TURN BACK UP THE RAMP
hK4Dwr5WR90_4 0 I WANT YOU TO OBSERVE IT AGAIN THE OVERLAP POINT RIGHT TOE AND COME BACK INTO THE BASIC
hK4Dwr5WR90_5 0 THE DIFFERENCE IN A MAN'S CATWALK OR STYLISH WALK AS WE LIKE TO REFER TO IT IS THAT THEY KEEP THE FEET SIDE BY SIDE
hK4Dwr5WR90_6 0 SO AS THEY MOVE LET'S DO THE FADE
hK4Dwr5WR90_7 0 THE ONLY TURN THEY USE IS THE FADE
hK4Dwr5WR90_8 0 ACTUALLY THAT TIME I DID IT AT THE FRONT OF THE RAMP AND THE BACK OF THE RAMP
hK4Dwr5WR90_9 0 SO WATCH AS THE MAN USES THE FADE TO THE RAMP AT THE TOP OF THE RAMP LITTLE ROCK STEP RIGHT HERE AND AS HE MOVES BACK UP TO THE TOP OF THE RAMP ANOTHER ROCK STEP AND HE OPENS BACK UP ENDING IN A BASIC JUST LIKE WE LEARNED IN THE FIRST POSITION FOR MEN IN THEIR POSE ROUTINE
hK4Dwr5WR90_10 0 FOR THE WOMEN THEY CAN ALSO USE THE FULL TURN
hK4Dwr5WR90_11 0 SO LADIES LET'S GO AND USE THE FULL TURN NOW 360 DEGREES
hK4Dwr5WR90_12 0 AS I'M OVERLAPPING MY FEET USING THE CATWALK I'M GOING TO CROSS TURN OUT AND STEP INTO MY HALF TURN TURNING OUT SO THAT WHEN I GET TO THE END OF THE RAMP ONCE AGAIN I CLOSE IT WITH THE BASIC A VERY PROFESSIONAL WAY OF STANDING AFTER YOU HAVE DONE THE TURNS
hK4Dwr5WR90_13 0 AGAIN THE FULL TURN TURNING ALL THE WAY CROSSING UP HALF TURN POINTING THE RIGHT FOOT TURNING LEFT BACK AGAIN POINTING THE RIGHT FOOT TURNING LEFT AND CLOSING WITH THE BASIC
hK4Dwr5WR90_14 0 DON'T FORGET THE ARMS THEY DON'T SWING TOO MUCH EVER
hK4Dwr5WR90_15 0 I'M DOING A HALF TURN LADIES THOUGH I CAN COMBINE THESE TURNS
hK4Dwr5WR90_16 0 I CAN ONLY DO A HALF TURN WHEN I NEED TO OR I CAN DO A FULL TURN
hK4Dwr5WR90_17 0 I'M GOING TO DO IT FOR THE BACK SIDE
hK4Dwr5WR90_18 0 LOTS OF TURNING
hK4Dwr5WR90_19 0 AND THE MEN DON'T FORGET ONLY USE THE FADE
hK4Dwr5WR90_20 0 FEET SIDE BY SIDE AND WALKING BACK
hK4Dwr5WR90_21 0 NOW THE WOMEN HAVE LEARNED THREE TURNS THE HALF TURN THE FULL TURN AND THE FADE
hK4Dwr5WR90_22 0 AND GENTLEMEN IT'S EASIER FOR YOU
hK4Dwr5WR90_23 0 IT'S GREAT THAT YOU ONLY HAVE TO DO THE FADE A VERY PROFESSIONAL TURN THAT YOU MIGHT USE ON THE RUNWAY

g6i5AeprEmE_12 0 WHAT DO YOU THINK MIGHT HAPPEN IN THIS STORY
g6i5AeprEmE_13 0 WHAT DO YOU THINK
g6i5AeprEmE_14 0 YOU NOTICE THE MAIN THING IS ONE QUESTION HAVE YOUR CHILD TRY TO PREDICT IT MOTIVATES THEM IT GETS THEM ENGAGED IN THE STORY AND IT STARTS CREATING JUDGMENT AND CREATIVE AND CRITICAL THINKING
g6i5AeprEmE_15 0 JUST SOMETHING AS SIMPLY AS SAYING WHAT DO YOU THINK THE STORY IS GOING TO BE ABOUT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN
g6i5AeprEmE_16 0 AND THEIR JUDGMENT SKILLS CREATIVE AND CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS ARE ENHANCED BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS AND ALSO THAT YOU'RE ASKING THEM THEIR OPINION
g6i5AeprEmE_17 0 THEIR SELF ESTEEM IS ENHANCED
g6i5AeprEmE_18 0 THEIR READING SKILLS SIMPLE SIMPLE STRATEGY AND TECHNIQUE
g6i5AeprEmE_20 0 ASK THEM TO PREDICT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE STORY MIGHT BE ABOUT
_HjUdR7k_Vw_1 0 HI THIS IS JOHN MICHAELS WITH EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO BUY A USED CAR
_HjUdR7k_Vw_2 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE MECHANICAL WORTHINESS OF A USED CAR
_HjUdR7k_Vw_3 0 REMEMBER THAT ANY TIME YOU ARE BUYING A USED CAR WHETHER IT IS FROM A PRIVATE PARTY OR A DEALERSHIP IT IS ALWAYS IN YOUR BEST INTEREST TO HAVE THE CAR INSPECTED BY A MECHANIC WHETHER OR NOT IT IS AT A DEALERSHIP OR IT IS A MECHANIC YOU KNOW
_HjUdR7k_Vw_4 0 PLEASE SPEND SOME TIME IN MAKING SURE THAT THAT NEW USED CAR THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO BUY HAS MECHANICAL WORTHINESS THAT WILL LAST YOU FOR MANY YEARS ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE FINANCING IT BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING WORSE THAN OWNING A CAR THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR EVERY MONTH THAT ENDS UP IN THE SERVICE STATION IMMEDIATELY SO REMEMBER HAVE THAT USED CAR CHECKED OUT BY A MECHANIC MAKE SURE THAT IT IS WORTHY OF YOUR PURCHASE
h_-0HYW5eOQ_1 0 HI I'M RYAN MCCANN AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO THROW A FOOTBALL LIKE A PRO
h_-0HYW5eOQ_2 0 FIRST OF ALL YOU WANT TO START WITH A GOOD BASE
h_-0HYW5eOQ_3 0 GOOD FOUNDATION TO THROW FROM
h_-0HYW5eOQ_4 0 ONCE YOU GET THAT WELL THAT REQUIRES JUST A GOOD SOLID FOUNDATION WHERE YOU'RE IN BALANCE AND IF SOMEBODY COMES TO PUSH YOU YOU'RE YOU KNOW YOU'RE SET
h_-0HYW5eOQ_5 0 AT THAT POINT SQUARE UP YOU'RE SHOULDERS TO WHERE YOU'RE THROWING TAKE A NICE STEP THROW IT
h_-0HYW5eOQ_6 0 THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU CAN THROW A FOOTBALL
h_-0HYW5eOQ_7 0 THE MAIN THING THAT YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON ARE TWO HANDS ON THE BALL
h_-0HYW5eOQ_8 0 SO IF SOMEBODY COMES UP FROM BEHIND YOU OR IN FRONT OF YOU THEY DON'T KNOCK IT OUT OF YOUR HAND
h_-0HYW5eOQ_9 0 SO DON'T BE SWINGING AROUND LIKE THIS
h_-0HYW5eOQ_10 0 TWO HANDS ON THE BALL AND YOU WANT TO KEEP THE BALL IDEALLY UP UP AROUND YOUR SHOULDERS
h_-0HYW5eOQ_11 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO CARRY THE BALL DOWN HERE BECAUSE WHAT THAT DOES IT CAUSES YOU TO HAVE A SLOW RELEASE
h_-0HYW5eOQ_12 0 AND THE FURTHER ALONG YOU PROGRESS IN YOUR CAREER THE QUICKER THE DECISIONS NEED TO BE AND THE QUICKER YOU NEED TO GET RID OF THE FOOTBALL
h_-0HYW5eOQ_13 0 SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL LEARN YOUNG
h_-0HYW5eOQ_14 0 HAVE THE BALL HERE AND HAVE THE QUICKEST RELEASE AS POSSIBLE MEANING DON'T TAKE THE BALL HERE AND THEN DROP IT DOWN HERE TO THROW IT
h_-0HYW5eOQ_15 0 HAVE THE BALL HERE BOOM QUICK RELEASE
h_-0HYW5eOQ_16 0 YOU GUYS CAN WATCH JOHN ELWAY HOLDS THE BALL HERE DOESN'T EVEN WIND UP THROWS IT FROM THERE
h_-0HYW5eOQ_17 0 DAN MARINO ANOTHER GREAT RELEASE
h_-0HYW5eOQ_18 0 OTHER THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THROWING A FOOTBALL LIKE I SAID ABOUT EARLIER GRIPPING THE FOOTBALL WHATEVER IS COMFORTABLE TO YOU JUST AS LONG AS YOU GET A NICE FEEL AND SPIRAL
h_-0HYW5eOQ_19 0 WHEN YOU THROW A FOOTBALL YOU DON'T THROW IT LIKE A BASEBALL LIKE THIS
h_-0HYW5eOQ_20 0 YOU THROW A FOOTBALL LIKE THIS BOOM
h_-0HYW5eOQ_21 0 SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IS THE BALL COMES OUT COMES OUT OF YOUR HAND AND SPIRALS TO GIVE IT THE ULTIMUM TRAJECTORY TO YOUR TARGET
grsV1YN1z5s_2 0 I'M TRACY GOODWIN AND I'M THE RED SWEATER LADY
grsV1YN1z5s_3 0 AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO ANALYZE A PLAY
grsV1YN1z5s_4 0 AND THIS IS THE FRANCIS HODGE VERSION OF ANALYZING A PLAY
grsV1YN1z5s_5 0 NOW WHO MIGHT ANALYZE A PLAY
grsV1YN1z5s_6 0 WELL MAYBE YOU'RE AN ACTOR AND YOU'VE BEEN CAST IN A PLAY OR YOU'VE BEEN ASSIGNED SOMETHING IN ONE OF YOUR THEATER CLASSES
grsV1YN1z5s_7 0 OR PERHAPS YOU'RE DIRECTING A PLAY AND YOU WANT TO DO THE BEST DIRECTING JOB THAT YOU CAN
grsV1YN1z5s_8 0 WELL THE BEST WAY TO FIND OUT EVERYTHING ABOUT A CHARACTER
grsV1YN1z5s_9 0 THE BEST WAY TO FIND OUT HOW TO DIRECT THE PLAY TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT THE PLAYWRIGHT'S INTENTIONS WERE IS TO ANALYZE THE PLAY
grsV1YN1z5s_10 0 AND YOU CAN'T REALLY ANALYZE A PLAY UNLESS YOU KNOW THE SPECIFIC STEPS THAT YOU WANT TO FOLLOW
grsV1YN1z5s_11 0 AND ACTUALLY THERE'S SOME VERY DETAILED AND VERY SPECIFIC STEPS THAT YOU WANT TO FOLLOW WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO ANALYZE A PLAY
grsV1YN1z5s_12 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO WALK THROUGH IT STEP BY STEP
grsV1YN1z5s_13 0 I ENCOURAGE EVERY ACTOR THAT I WORK WITH WHETHER THEY'RE DOING A MONOLOGUE OR WHETHER THEY'RE DOING A SCENE OR EVEN IF THEY'VE BEEN CAST IN AN ENTIRE PLAY OR MOVIE TO ANALYZE THE ENTIRE PIECE
grsV1YN1z5s_14 0 THAT WAY THEY KNOW THE FULL CONCEPT OF THE CHARACTER AND HIS ROLE OR HER ROLE IN THE WORLD OF THE PLAY
grsV1YN1z5s_15 0 SO LET'S GET STARTED
GD-8n8PDl44_1 0 BUT WHAT I WANT TO POINT OUT IF I MAY IS THAT HANDWRITING IS SO ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL
GD-8n8PDl44_2 0 AND WITHOUT THE ALPHABET WE EVERYTHING WOULD FALL APART
GD-8n8PDl44_3 0 EVERYTHING IN OUR CULTURE DEPENDS UPON THE ALPHABET
GD-8n8PDl44_4 0 OH YOU SAY TO YOURSELF WELL WE HAVE COMPUTERS WELL EXCUSE ME BUT COMPUTERS DEPEND ON THE ALPHABET
GD-8n8PDl44_5 0 IF THE ALPHABET WERE TO DISAPPEAR COMPUTERS WOULD HAVE NOTHING NO WAY OF ORGANIZING
GD-8n8PDl44_6 0 THEY WOULDN'T BE THEY WOULD JUST FALL APART
GD-8n8PDl44_7 0 AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO SIGNS AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO HANDWRITING TO SIGN YOUR CHECKS AND EVERYTHING WOULD JUST GO RIGHT DOWN THE TUBES
GD-8n8PDl44_8 0 SO PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ALPHABET IS CAN BE PRETTY IMPORTANT
GD-8n8PDl44_9 0 YOU KNOW WHAT I DO WHEN I MEET CHILDREN IF THEY ARE AROUND AN AGE WHEN I KNOW THEY MIGHT BE LEARNING ABOUT THE ALPHABET I ASK THEM THIS BIG IMPORTANT QUESTION
GD-8n8PDl44_10 0 I SAY HOW'S YOUR ALPHABET
GD-8n8PDl44_11 0 AND THEN THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THAT
GD-8n8PDl44_12 0 SO THEN I SAY WHATEVER I THINK THEY ARE READY TO HEAR ABOUT THE ALPHABET
GD-8n8PDl44_13 0 AND I MENTION TO THEM THAT I AM THE ALPHABET DOCTOR
GD-8n8PDl44_14 0 SO SOMETIMES I WIND UP GIVING THEM THEIR OWN ALPHABET
GD-8n8PDl44_15 0 THIS IS KEVIN'S ALPHABET
GD-8n8PDl44_16 0 AND SOMETIMES I WIND UP MAKING A DEAL WITH THE PARENTS AND I GIVE THAT SAME CHILD WHAT I CALL AN IQ TEST
GD-8n8PDl44_17 0 AND I HAVE FOUND THAT I CAN SIT DOWN WITH A CHILD AND I CAN JUST USING THE ALPHABET OK AS OUR BASE OF OPERATIONS
GD-8n8PDl44_18 0 I CAN DETERMINE ALL KINDS OF THINGS ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE OF THAT CHILD THERE WAS GOING TO BE GOOD THINGS
GD-8n8PDl44_19 0 BUT I CAN DETERMINE TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT I HAVE HAD PARENTS SAY TO ME OH YEAH WELL THAT'S WHAT THEY CAME UP WITH IN SCHOOL
GD-8n8PDl44_20 0 YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT THE PSYCHOLOGIST CAME UP WITH
GD-8n8PDl44_21 0 ONLY I THINK I CAN GO ONE BETTER BECAUSE I THINK INSTEAD OF JUST TESTING THEM AT THAT POINT AND IN THAT EXPERIENCE I CAN ALSO GIVE THEM SOME OR I CAN OPEN SOME DOORWAYS FOR THEM
gKwZ6s71r5Y_1 0 OKAY OUR NEXT CLIP IS GOING TO BE A SEATED ROW
gKwZ6s71r5Y_2 0 WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR RESISTANCE BAND AND START WITH THE BAND UNDERNEATH BOTH OF YOUR FEET IN THE INSTEP
gKwZ6s71r5Y_3 0 WRAP IT AROUND THE BASE
gKwZ6s71r5Y_4 0 TRY AND GET AND EVEN AMOUNT FOR YOU TO GRIP
gKwZ6s71r5Y_5 0 OKAY AND YOU'RE GOING TO SCOOCH BACK
gKwZ6s71r5Y_6 0 NOW YOU CAN HAVE YOUR LEGS BENT THAT'S THE WAY I PREFER WITH A SLIGHT ANGLE ON THE BACK
gKwZ6s71r5Y_7 0 IF YOU HAVE BACK ISSUES YOU CAN PUT THE LEGS FLAT WITH A SLIGHT BEND IN THE KNEE
gKwZ6s71r5Y_8 0 BUT FOR OUR PURPOSES WE'RE GOING TO DO IT THIS WAY
gKwZ6s71r5Y_9 0 GRAB BY THE SIDES LEAN BACK SLIGHTLY GRAB WITH AN OVERHAND GRIP BRING THE ELBOWS CLOSE TO THE BODY AND ROW IT BACK SQUEEZING THE SHOULDER BLADES TOGETHER
gKwZ6s71r5Y_10 0 RELAXING THE SHOULDERS AND THE NECK COMING FORWARD AND ROWING BACK
gKwZ6s71r5Y_11 0 NOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO ON THIS ONE IS MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE BREATHING PROPERLY
gKwZ6s71r5Y_12 0 YOU'RE GOING TO EXHALE ON THE WAY BACK AND THEN INHALE AS YOU COME FORWARD
gKwZ6s71r5Y_13 0 YOU CAN ALWAYS CHANGE THE GRIP PALMS DOWN AND OPEN IT BACK KEEPING THE SHOULDERS RELAXED AS YOU BRING THOSE SHOULDER BLADES TOGETHER
gKwZ6s71r5Y_14 0 IF YOU STILL WANT TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING ADDITIONAL COME BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ROW POSITION AND YOU CAN ADD A ROTATION
gKwZ6s71r5Y_15 0 SO YOU'RE COMBINING THE TWO GRIPS
gKwZ6s71r5Y_16 0 YOU'RE COMBINING THE FIRST GRIP WITH THE SECOND GRIP
gKwZ6s71r5Y_17 0 OKAY YOU WANT TO KEEP THOSE ELBOWS A LITTLE BIT BENT
gKwZ6s71r5Y_18 0 MAKE SURE YOU'RE BREATHING PROPERLY
gKwZ6s71r5Y_19 0 EXHALE ON THE WAY BACK INHALE ON THE WAY FORWARD
gKwZ6s71r5Y_20 0 AND REMEMBER OUR FIRST OPTION IF YOU HAVE BACK ISSUES YOU CAN ALWAYS PUT BOTH LEGS FLAT
gKwZ6s71r5Y_21 0 OKAY THIS IS HOW THIS WOULD LOOK AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GIVE IT A NICE ROW
gKwZ6s71r5Y_22 0 KEEPING THAT BACK NICE AND PROTECTED
gjXkXTG4qqY_1 0 HI MY NAME IS TIM COLE
gjXkXTG4qqY_2 0 I'M WITH THE AUSTIN REPTILE SERVICE
gjXkXTG4qqY_3 0 I'VE BEEN KEEPING REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS FOR OVER FORTY YEARS
gjXkXTG4qqY_4 0 AND WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT IDENTIFYING FROGS
gjXkXTG4qqY_5 0 PROBABLY THE MOST COMMONLY USED METHOD WOULD BE TO ACQUIRE A FIELD GUIDE FOR THE AREA THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR FROGS
gjXkXTG4qqY_6 0 IF YOU'RE TRAVELING TO ANOTHER STATE YOU COULD GET A STATE FIELD GUIDE WHICH WOULD PROBABLY CARRY ALL THE FROGS THAT ARE FOUND IN THAT AREA
gjXkXTG4qqY_7 0 THAT'S AN EASY WAY TO IDENTIFY THEM
gjXkXTG4qqY_8 0 ALSO FROG CALLS
gjXkXTG4qqY_9 0 A LOT OF PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENTS IN VARIOUS STATES HAVE CD'S AVAILABLE WITH FROG CALLS ON EM
gjXkXTG4qqY_10 0 AND EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY NOT SEE THE FROG YOU CAN CERTAINLY HEAR THE FROGS

GdwI5f0-sJc_1 0 HI MY NAME'S ELIZABETH AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GdwI5f0-sJc_2 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK TODAY IS BIRDS THAT BITE
GdwI5f0-sJc_3 0 THE NUMBER ONE REASON THAT MOST PARROTS BITE IS OUT OF FEAR
GdwI5f0-sJc_4 0 SO IF YOUR BIRD IS BITING THE NUMBER ONE WAY FOR YOU TO GET YOUR BIRD TO STOP BITING IS TO FIGURE OUT WHY YOUR BIRD IS BITING AND CHANGE IT SO YOU'RE NO LONGER THREATENING THIS ANIMAL AND HE'S NO LONGER FRIGHTENED
GdwI5f0-sJc_5 0 YOUR OBVIOUSLY PUSHING YOURSELF ON THIS BIRD OR HE'S FRIGHTENED OR SOMETHING IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE THAT THIS IS THE LAST FORM OF SELF DEFENSE
GdwI5f0-sJc_6 0 MOST BIRDS IN THE WILD WOULD JUST CHOOSE TO FLY AWAY VERSUS AGGRESSIVELY BITING YOU
GdwI5f0-sJc_7 0 SO MOST BIRDS WHEN THEY BITE IS LIKE A DOG THAT BITES THEY FEEL CORNERED
GdwI5f0-sJc_8 0 SO YOU NEED TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE THIS EXPERIENCE MORE COMFORTABLE
GdwI5f0-sJc_9 0 IF YOU HAVE A BIRD THAT BITES AND YOU AND YOU WANNA GET A PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR OUT OF HIM SUCH AS STEP UP OR IF YOU'VE GOT THEM ALREADY ON YOUR HAND
GdwI5f0-sJc_10 0 COME HERE KAREN STEP UP GOOD GIRL
GdwI5f0-sJc_11 0 LET'S SAY FOR INSTANCE KAREN WANTED TO BITE ME AND I WAS ABOUT TO JUST DO SOMETHING LIKE SAY STEP UP AND INSTEAD OF STEPPING UP SORRY SHE SWITCHED AND SHE DECIDED THAT SHE WANTED TO BITE MY HAND SO WHAT I WOULD DO IS JUST AS SHE WAS REACHING SORRY I'M SORRY AS SHE WAS REACHING FOR HER BEAK WHAT I'D DO IS I'D WOBBLE MY HAND EVER SO SLIGHTLY JUST LIKE THIS AS SHE'S REACHING TO BITE
GdwI5f0-sJc_12 0 WHAT THAT DOES IS IT'S A NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT THEY DON'T LIKE LOSING THEIR BALANCE AND SO IT'LL STOP THE BITING BEHAVIOR
GdwI5f0-sJc_13 0 YOU CAN DO THIS TWO OR THREE TIMES UNTIL YOU CAN OFFER YOUR HAND AND SHE NO LONGER TRIES TO BITE BEFORE STANDING UP ONTO THE NEXT HAND
GdwI5f0-sJc_14 0 THAT'S ONE WAY TO START JUST KEEP THEM FROM BITING FROM ONE HAND TO THE NEXT
GdwI5f0-sJc_15 0 AGAIN THAT'S NOT A WAY OF CAUSING IT TO BE A MORE POSITIVE EXPERIENCE BUT IMMEDIATELY IT CAN KEEP YOU FROM GETTING BITTEN
GdwI5f0-sJc_16 0 THE OTHER WAY AGAIN IS TO REACH FROM BEHIND THE BIRD
GdwI5f0-sJc_17 0 THE LAST METHOD TO KEEP FROM BITING IS TO OBVIOUSLY JUST OFFER A DISTRACTION AT THE SAME TIME
GdwI5f0-sJc_18 0 SO IF KAREN WANTED TO BITE WHAT I WOULD DO IS I'D SAY STEP UP AND AT THE SAME TIME SORRY MY BIRDS CAN FLY SO THEY CAN CHOOSE TO NOT INTERACT WITH ME
GdwI5f0-sJc_19 0 YOU'D OFFER A DISTRACTION SO IF I WAS GOING TO ASK HER TO STEP UP AT THE SAME TIME I'D OFFER HER TO STEP UP I'D OFFER A DISTRACTION AT THE SAME TIME THIS CAN BE A PIECE OF A POPSICLE STICK OR A PIECE OF FOOD AND ASK THEM TO DO HE TWO ACTIVITIES SIMULTANEOUSLY
GdwI5f0-sJc_20 0 SO YOU'LL OFFER FOOD WHILE WHILE OFFERING YOUR HAND
GdwI5f0-sJc_21 0 THIS OFTEN TIMES IS DISTRACTING ENOUGH TO BREAK THE BITE BEHAVIOR
GdwI5f0-sJc_22 0 SO THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS TO STOP BITING THE NUMBER ONE WAY IS TO DISTRACT AND THE OTHER NUMBER ONE WAY WOULD BE TO FIGURE OUT WHY THE BIRD WANTS TO BITE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE AND CHANGE UP THEIR ENVIRONMENT
GdwI5f0-sJc_23 0 TRY TO CREATE THE SITUATION IN SUCH A WAY THAT IS POSITIVE AND THE BIRD WANTS TO INTERACT SO THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BITE YOU INSTEAD
GVWXveM_fzE_1 0 THE FOUR BALL SIDE BY SIDE MULTIPLEX START
GVWXveM_fzE_2 0 JUST LIKE THE THREE BALL MULTIPLEX START IT'S A COOL WAY TO START
GVWXveM_fzE_3 0 I MEAN IT'S BETTER THAN JUST DOING THIS
GVWXveM_fzE_4 0 PEOPLE LIKE TO SEE A GOOD FLASHY MOVE TO START
GVWXveM_fzE_5 0 SO THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD ONE AND IT'S PRETTY BASIC
GVWXveM_fzE_6 0 YOU STACK THE FOUR BALLS IN YOUR HANDS LIKE THIS O.K
GVWXveM_fzE_7 0 IT'S A WRIST MOTION AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS IN THE AIR YOU WANT THEM TO SPLIT AND FORM COLUMNS
GVWXveM_fzE_8 0 AND IT'S VERY EASY THE BOTTOM TWO YOU CATCH AND THEN IT'S AUTOMATICALLY A COLUMN JUST LIKE THAT
GVWXveM_fzE_9 0 IT'S A FLICK OF THE WRIST O.K
GVWXveM_fzE_10 0 THAT WASN'T THE SMOOTHEST EVER BUT YOU GET THE POINT
GVWXveM_fzE_11 0 THAT IS A VERY COOL START AND IT DOESN'T TAKE A WHOLE LOT OF PRACTICE AND IT DOESN'T TAKE A WHOLE LOT OF TECHNIQUE
GVWXveM_fzE_12 0 IT'S FAIRLY SELF EXPLANATORY
GVWXveM_fzE_13 0 THE KEY ONCE AGAIN IS IN THE WRIST FLICK
GVWXveM_fzE_14 0 SO WORK ON THAT AND YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD FOUR BALL START
gWeZqePefHE_1 0 SO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE YOURSELF AN AMPLE SUPPLY AS ALWAYS OF RAGS AND PAPER TOWELS
gWeZqePefHE_2 0 WHEN YOU ARE WORKING WITH A MESSY BUSINESS OF ADHESIVES YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOMETHING AVAILABLE THAT IS CLEAN AND DRY IN ORDER FOR YOU TO WIPE OFF
gWeZqePefHE_3 0 YOU ARE TENDING TO USE YOUR FINGERS A LOT
gWeZqePefHE_4 0 YOU'LL SEE AS I GO ON FURTHER BUT I ALWAYS LIKE TO HAVE A NICE CLEANER TOWEL THAT I TEND TO USE AND THEN I PREFER THE SHOP TOWELS MOSTLY BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE USING ANY STANDARD SORT OF KITCHEN TOWELS THEY TEND TO BREAK APART FALL APART AND ACTUALLY GET STUCK TO YOUR FINGERS AS YOU ARE TRYING TO WIPE OFF ADHESIVES
gWeZqePefHE_5 0 THESE ARE MORE LIKE A FABRIC SO THEY DON'T TEND TO FALL APART AS EASY AND ALSO THEY ARE GREAT FOR USING ACTUALLY ON THE SURFACE OF YOUR PIECE FOR CLEANING UP EDGES AND WIPING AWAY EXTRA ADHESIVE THAT HAS MAYBE BEEN APPLIED TOO THICKLY
gWeZqePefHE_6 0 SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING CLEAN AND DRY TO WORK WITH AND HAVE AN AMPLE SUPPLY OF EXTRA PAPER TOWELS SO THAT IF YOU SHOULD RUN THROUGH THEM ALL YOU HAVE EXTRAS TO USE AND YOU CAN JUST THROW AWAY WHAT YOU ARE WORKING WITH
H6qfaaYf5RI_1 0 RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT DOING SPIN TRICKS WITH THE TASSEL SPIN
H6qfaaYf5RI_2 0 THE FIRST ONE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS SPINNING THE CRYSTAL STICK UNDERNEATH YOUR LEG
H6qfaaYf5RI_3 0 WE'D ALREADY TALKED ABOUT DOING THIS WITH JUST THE NORMAL TICKTOCK AND NORMAL SPIN
H6qfaaYf5RI_4 0 THE TASSEL SPIN TECHNIQUE IS VERY DIFFERENT
H6qfaaYf5RI_5 0 IT LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THAT
H6qfaaYf5RI_6 0 NOW WHAT I'M ACTUALLY DOING IS I'M SPINNING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE STICK GETTING AN OUTSIDE SPIN ON THE TASSEL KICKING MY LEG OVER AND LETTING THE STICK JUST ROLL OVER MY LEG LIKE THAT AND BACK OUT TO MY RIGHT CONTROL STICK JUST LIKE THAT
H6qfaaYf5RI_7 0 NOW TO WORK ON THIS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET THIS CATCH DOWN AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE USED TO KICKING YOUR LEG UP AND CATCHING THE UNDERSIDE OF THE CRYSTAL STICK OR SORRY THE TOP SIDE OF THE CRYSTAL STICK ON THE UNDERSIDE OF YOUR LEG AT THE RIGHT BALANCE POINT SO THAT JUST SPINS OVER NICE AND EASY LIKE THAT
H6qfaaYf5RI_8 0 THAT'S UNDER THE LEG WITH A TASSEL SPIN
H6qfaaYf5RI_9 0 NOW I REALLY LIKE THIS TRICK
H6qfaaYf5RI_10 0 THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I PLAY WITH CRYSTAL STICKS INSTEAD OF DEVIL STICKS IS THAT I CAN EXECUTE THAT RIGHT THERE
hF0nsOiFBX8_1 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO BUY A HOOKAH AND YOU'RE GOING TO LOAD YOUR FIRST BOWL SOME OF THE BOWLS YOU MIGHT GET LOOK LIKE THIS THEY DON'T USUALLY HAVE THE TOP ON IT LIKE THAT BUT YOU CAN PUT YOUR LITTLE TOP ON IT IT JUST KEEPS THE ASH IN AND IT KEEPS THE HEAT IN AS WELL
hF0nsOiFBX8_2 0 SEE THE HOLES IN THE BOTTOM I EXPLAINED THE BOWL A LITTLE BIT MORE BEFORE THERE YOU GO SO YOU PUT THE SHISHA RIGHT THERE AND WHEN THE HEAT GETS DRAWN THROUGH PULLS THE SHISHA THROUGH THOSE HOLES THROUGH THE HOOKAH SO ON THIS TINY LITTLE BOWL
hF0nsOiFBX8_3 0 NOW THIS IS THE TINY BOWL FOR THE MINI HOOKAH THAT I SHOWED YOU EARLIER SO ON THAT TINY LITTLE BOWL I'D PUT VERY MINIMALLY JUST LIKE THAT
hF0nsOiFBX8_4 0 NOT THAT MUCH BEFORE YOU PUT IT ON YOUR SCREEN
hF0nsOiFBX8_5 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE GOING TO A HOOKAH YOU CAN EXPECT TO PAY AT A HOOKAH BAR YOU CAN EXPECT TO PAY ABOUT ANYWHERE FROM TEN TO ABOUT FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER HOOKAH BOWL THAT YOU SMOKE
hF0nsOiFBX8_6 0 HOOKAH LASTS FOR ABOUT FORTY-FIVE MINUTES SO IT COSTS ABOUT TWELVE DOLLARS HERE AT THE HOOKAH BUT IF YOU HAVE A BIG GROUP YOU SPLIT THAT COST AMONGST MANY PEOPLE AND IT LASTS FOR FORTY-FIVE MINUTES SO PASS THE HOOKAH AROUND FOR THOSE FORTY-MINUTES GET VERY SOCIAL GET TO KNOW PEOPLE GET A COUPLE COCKTAILS IN YOU AND YOU WILL HAVE A BLAST SO
gcHR4jFmiis_1 0 BEFORE YOU GO IN A CAVE DON'T GO ALONE AND DON'T GO WITHOUT ANY GUIDE
gcHR4jFmiis_2 0 IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT
gcHR4jFmiis_3 0 IT IS DANGEROUS
gcHR4jFmiis_4 0 EACH OF YOU PASS EACH OTHER AND JUST LOOK AT THE OTHER ONE BECAUSE IN THIS WAY YOU WILL SEE WHERE YOU SHOULD TURN LEFT OR RIGHT HOW YOU HOLD YOUR FEET YOUR HANDS AND YOUR PARTS OF THE BODY AND THEN THIS WAY IT IS VERY SAFE
gcHR4jFmiis_5 0 JUST KEEP A SHORT DISTANCE BETWEEN EACH OTHER MAYBE TWO METERS OR THREE BUT IF IT IS MORE THAN THAT IS TOO LONG AND TRY TO GO IN THE SAME WAY AS THE OTHER PERSON WHO IS IN FRONT OF YOU IS GOING SO IF THE OTHER PERSON IS SITTING HIS OR HER BUTT DOWN AND SLIDING BY FEET FIRST SOMEWHERE IN A HOLE JUST DO THE SAME
gcHR4jFmiis_6 0 JUST SIT DOWN AND SLIDE FEET FIRST
gcHR4jFmiis_7 0 IN THIS WAY I ASK YOU ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LEAVE A HARDER PART JUST WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE BECAUSE IN THIS WAY HE OR SHE SHOULD SEE THE MOVING WAY AND IF NEEDED YOU CAN ALSO EXPLAIN THE WAY YOU ARE GOING
gcHR4jFmiis_8 0 DON'T JUMP NEVER JUMP ALWAYS TRY TO CLIMB
gcHR4jFmiis_9 0 THEN SLIDE FEET FIRST
G8GDhb81nWc_1 0 THIS IS SEAN FROM EXPERT VILLAGE
G8GDhb81nWc_2 0 ONCE YOU YOU GOT ENOUGH SPEED COMING DOWN THE QUARTERS SLOW TO MEDIUM PACE YOU WANT TO HEAD UP THE RAMP
G8GDhb81nWc_3 0 YOU WANT TO KIND OF GET UP TO THE LIP AND THAT IS WHEN YOU PULL THE FRONT BRAKE AND DO A LITTLE ROTATING
G8GDhb81nWc_4 0 ONCE YOU CLEAR THE LIP LET GO OF YOUR BRAKE WHILE FEATHERING IT USING YOUR WEIGHT AS BALANCE MOVE IT ALL THE WAY BACK
G8GDhb81nWc_5 0 TILL YOU GET AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN FAR AWAY FROM THE LIP YOUR WEIGHT WILL KIND OF GET BACK THIS WAY AND LEAN YOUR BODY WEIGHT OUT TOWARDS THE RAMP
G8GDhb81nWc_6 0 THAT WAY YOU CAN HOP IN NICE AND SMOOTH
G8GDhb81nWc_7 0 WHEN YOU PULL THE BRAKE TO STOP GO AHEAD AND LEAN FORWARD
G8GDhb81nWc_8 0 IF YOU LEAN BACK YOU'RE GOING TO SLAM YOUR BACK TIRE DOWN AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT
G8GDhb81nWc_9 0 ONCE YOU GOTTEN IT RIGHT YOU WILL GO AHEAD AND JUST JUMP IN LET GO OF YOUR FRONT BRAKE AND RIDE AWAY NICE AND SMOOTH

H_0Mxrr1ZAg_2 0 MY NAME IS ROBERT SEGUNDO AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A SHEET BEND KNOT
H_0Mxrr1ZAg_3 0 NOW A SHEET BEND IS USUALLY MEANT FOR PUTTING TWO DIFFERENT ROPES OF TWO DIFFERENT SIZES TOGETHER AND USING IN WET CONDITIONS
H_0Mxrr1ZAg_4 0 THIS IS A GREAT ONE TO HOOK ROPES TOGETHER REALLY QUICKLY SO YOU CAN YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT USUALLY WHEN IT'S RAINING OR STORMING
H_0Mxrr1ZAg_5 0 SO IF YOU LOOK DOWN YOU CAN SEE THAT WE HAVE TWO LENGTHS OF ROPE HERE AND THEY'RE BOTH THE SAME SIZE BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER THEY'LL WORK THE SAME WAY ON EITHER ONE
H_0Mxrr1ZAg_6 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PULL A BEND INTO ONE OF MY ROPES LIKE SO
H_0Mxrr1ZAg_7 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS ONE MY OTHER WORKING END AND IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN LIKE SO
H_0Mxrr1ZAg_8 0 I'M GOING TO WRAP IT AROUND BOTH EDGES AND TUCK IT UNDER LIKE SO
H_0Mxrr1ZAg_9 0 AND WHEN I PULL IT DOWN THIS IS GOING TO BE A NICE TIGHT BEND AND THIS WILL HOLD BOTH OF THESE ROPES TOGETHER
H_0Mxrr1ZAg_10 0 AND THIS IS REALLY GREAT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO PUT A BEND IN YOUR ROPES BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO RE-USE YOUR ROPES
H_0Mxrr1ZAg_11 0 AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH PRESSURE YOU PUT ON THIS YOU WILL STILL BE ABLE TO UNTIE IT

h4MIaET-34Q_1 0 NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO ATTACH THE CURTAINS TO THE BORDER
h4MIaET-34Q_2 0 THE EASIEST THING TO DO IS TO USE A STAPLER AND THIS IS GOING TO LET US PUT THE CURTAINS ONTO THE BORDER
h4MIaET-34Q_3 0 BUT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE STAPLER FROM THE FRONT WHICH ISN'T THE MOST AESTHETIC THE MOST THE CLEANEST LOOK THAT WE CAN GET FOR OUR THEATER
h4MIaET-34Q_4 0 BUT WE CAN PUT THAT OTHER PIECE OF FELT THAT OTHER STRIP THAT WE CUT AND WE CAN PUT IT ACROSS THE TOP OF THE BORDER AND THAT WILL COVER UP THE STAPLES THAT WILL SHOW FROM THE TOP
h4MIaET-34Q_5 0 SO THE STAPLES IS THIS IS THE MOST EASIEST WAY TO ATTACH THE CURTAINS AND IT'S ALSO PROBABLY THE MOST SECURE WAY SO THAT'S WHY WE CHOSE TO USE IT
h4MIaET-34Q_6 0 AND BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE COVERING IT UP WE DIDN'T MIND HAVING THE STAPLES SHOW THROUGH
h4MIaET-34Q_7 0 SO NOW WE HAVE THE CURTAINS ATTACHED TO THE BORDER
h4MIaET-34Q_8 0 WE CAN GO AHEAD AND PLACE THE OTHER PIECE OF FELT AND PUT IT RIGHT ACROSS THE TOP AND THAT WILL ALSO COMPLETE THE LOOK OF THE CURTAINS
h4MIaET-34Q_9 0 IF YOU WANT YOU CAN HAVE THIS PIECE OF FELT STANDING UP JUST A DROP TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE BORDER OF A REAL SET OF CURTAINS
h4MIaET-34Q_10 0 WE'RE GOING TO LAY IT STRAIGHT FLAT ACROSS AND WE DO THIS BY PUTTING GLUE RIGHT ONTO THE FELT
h4MIaET-34Q_11 0 YOU CAN BE SOMEWHAT GENEROUS WITH IT BECAUSE THE FELT NEEDS A NICE COAT FOR IT TO STICK SECURELY TO THE OTHER PIECE OF FELT
h4MIaET-34Q_12 0 ONCE YOU'VE PUT A NICE LINE OF GLUE ACROSS THE FELT YOU GO AHEAD AND STICK IT RIGHT ONTO THE BORDER
h4MIaET-34Q_13 0 ANY GLUE THAT SQUEEZED THROUGH THE FELT AS YOU'RE PRESSING DOWN WILL DRY CLEAR IF YOU'RE USING A WHITE GLUE A REGULAR CRAFTS GLUE SO THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM
h4MIaET-34Q_14 0 AND WE SEE THAT ONCE WE PUT THE BORDER ON WE STAND IT UP THE CURTAINS REALLY MAKE THE THEATER LOOK LIKE AN AUTHENTIC THEATER IT'S A NICE EFFECT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I REALLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE MAKING YOUR PUPPET THEATER TO ADD ON THESE CURTAINS
h4MIaET-34Q_15 0 SO NOW I'VE SHOWN YOU HOW TO PLACE CURTAINS ONTO THE PICTURE FRAME BORDER THAT'S USED FOR OUR PUPPET THEATER

hbcjpXqGSHU_1 0 SUPTA BADDHA KONASANA IS ANOTHER BOUND ANGLE POSE
hbcjpXqGSHU_2 0 SO AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO USE YOUR STRAPS
hbcjpXqGSHU_3 0 WE'LL BEGIN IN BADDHA KONASANA CONNECTING THE SOLES OF YOUR FEET AND WITH COMFORT YOU WANT TO BRING THE HEELS AS CLOSE TO YOUR GROIN SO THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE TO LIFT AND LENGTHEN YOUR SPINE
hbcjpXqGSHU_4 0 HERE'S WE WILL TAKE YOUR STRAP BRING IT AROUND YOUR LOWER BACK AND THEN INSIDE BOTH LEGS
hbcjpXqGSHU_5 0 TAKE THE SIDE WITHOUT THE BUCKLE AROUND YOUR FEET AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE THE SIDE WITHOUT THE BUCKLE CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT THE BUCKLE ON YOUR SKIN IT CAN BECOME UNCOMFORTABLE
hbcjpXqGSHU_6 0 AND THEN WE'LL JUST LOCK YOURSELF IN
hbcjpXqGSHU_7 0 NOW IF YOU PULL YOUR STRAP TOO TIGHT WHEN YOU GO TO RECLINE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AS YOU RECLINE IS YOUR FEET ARE GOING TO PICK UP
hbcjpXqGSHU_8 0 WHAT WE WANT THE STRAP TO DO IS DRAW THE HEELS CLOSER IN TO YOUR GROINS AS YOU BEGIN TO RECLINE
hbcjpXqGSHU_9 0 SO IF WE GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOK AT JENNIFER BRINGING HERSELF BACK INTO THE RECLINE POSITION WE CAN SEE THAT THE HEELS BECOME CLOSER INTO THE GROINS AND THE BELT IS SUPPORTING ALL THE WORK
hbcjpXqGSHU_10 0 THEN SHE'LL CONTINUE TO OPEN THE ARMS ENCOURAGING THE AND TO CAUSE THE MUSCLES TO BEGIN TO STRETCH OPENING THE GROINS SO SHE'S OPENING THE GROINS TO THE KNEES AND SHE'S CREATING FLEXIBILITY IN HER KNEES
hbcjpXqGSHU_11 0 BEING SURE THAT SHE SUPPORTS ON HER SHOULDERS NEVER ON THE NECK ON THE CERVICAL VERTERBRAES IN THE NECK
hbcjpXqGSHU_12 0 AND THEN SHE'LL BEGIN TO SEE IF SHE CAN'T FEEL THE BELLY RISE WITH EVERY INHALE AND FALL WITH EVERY EXHALE
hbcjpXqGSHU_13 0 SEE IF SHE CAN'T FEEL THE LOWER BACK EXPAND RISE AND FALL
hbcjpXqGSHU_14 0 SO THE BREATH IS GOING FRONT AND BACK SIDE TO SIDE AND TOP TO BOTTOM
GD5-_-fIAOg_1 0 THE BEST WAY TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE TRULY IN LABOR IS IF YOU HAVE PROGRESSIVE CONTRACTIONS
GD5-_-fIAOg_2 0 THESE MEANS THAT YOUR CONTRACTIONS ARE GETTING CLOSER TOGETHER AND THEY'RE GETTING LONGER
GD5-_-fIAOg_3 0 NOW WHEN YOUR CONTRACTIONS START THEY MIGHT BE REALLY FAR APART
GD5-_-fIAOg_4 0 THEY MIGHT BE THIRTY MINUTES APART OR THEY MIGHT BE FORTY-FIVE MINUTES APART
GD5-_-fIAOg_5 0 BUT IF YOU NOTICE A PATTERN IF YOU NOTICE THAT EVERY FORTY-FIVE MINUTES OR EVERY THIRTY MINUTES YOU'RE GETTING A CONTRACTION THAT CONTRACTION PROBABLY WOULD LAST ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS THEN THAT'S PROBABLY A REALLY GOOD SIGN THAT YOU ARE IN LABOR
GD5-_-fIAOg_6 0 YOU STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO
GD5-_-fIAOg_7 0 IT'S STILL EARLY LABOR BUT YOU'RE GOING TO NOTICE THAT EVENTUALLY OVER TIME THOSE CONTRACTIONS ARE GOING TO GET CLOSER TOGETHER AND THEY'RE GOING TO GET LONGER
GD5-_-fIAOg_8 0 WHEN YOU HAVE A BRAXTON HICK USUALLY IF YOU STAND UP OR YOU CHANGE POSITIONS THAT CONTRACTION IS GOING TO GO AWAY
GD5-_-fIAOg_9 0 IT'S THE OPPOSITE WITH TRUE LABOR CONTRACTIONS
GD5-_-fIAOg_10 0 WHEN YOU CHANGE POSITIONS WALK AROUND OR STAND UP IT'S MOST LIKELY THAT YOUR CONTRACTION IS GOING TO GET HARDER AND STRONGER AND IT'S GOING TO BE MORE INTENSE
GD5-_-fIAOg_11 0 WHICH IS A GOOD THING BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP MOVING AROUND YOU'LL WANT TO GET THOSE LABOR PAINS GOING TO HOPEFULLY MAKE LABOR NOT LAST AS LONG
GD5-_-fIAOg_12 0 SO WHEN YOU GET A CONTRACTION IT STARTS AT THE TOP OF YOUR UTERUS AND WORKS ITS WAY DOWN
GD5-_-fIAOg_13 0 THE UTERUS IS LIKE FINGERS IN THE WAY THAT IT IS ALL TOGETHER
GD5-_-fIAOg_14 0 SOME WOMEN SAY THAT IT FEELS LIKE REALLY HARD MENSTRUAL CRAMPS
GD5-_-fIAOg_15 0 OTHER WOMEN FEEL A TIGHTENING SENSATION
GD5-_-fIAOg_16 0 OTHER WOMEN MIGHT FEEL IT IN THE BACK DEPENDING ON THE POSITION OF THE BABY
GD5-_-fIAOg_17 0 SOME WOMEN FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE GAS WHEN IT'S JUST STARTING
GD5-_-fIAOg_18 0 IT'S VERY HARD TO DESCRIBE WHAT A LABOR PAIN FEELS LIKE BECAUSE IT FEELS DIFFERENT FOR EVER WOMAN
GD5-_-fIAOg_19 0 SO THE UTERUS IS CALLED THE FUNDUS
GD5-_-fIAOg_20 0 AND THE UTERUS IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT PARTS DIFFERENT LIGAMENTS ALMOST AND THEY'RE LIKE FINGERS
GD5-_-fIAOg_21 0 THEY COME IN TOGETHER LIKE THIS AND THEY COME IN TOGETHER LIKE THIS
GD5-_-fIAOg_22 0 AND THEY'RE ALL OVER
GD5-_-fIAOg_23 0 SO WHAT HAPPENS IS FROM THE TOP OF YOUR UTERUS THOSE FINGERS START SQUEEZING
GD5-_-fIAOg_24 0 SO YOU'RE HAVING SENSATIONS THIS WAY YOU'RE HAVING SENSATIONS THIS WAY YOU'RE HAVING SENSATIONS THIS WAY
GD5-_-fIAOg_25 0 AND THOSE FINGERS ARE GOING TO WORK DOWN AND YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL IT TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF YOUR UTERUS
GD5-_-fIAOg_26 0 TOWARDS THE BEGINNING WHEN YOUR CONTRACTIONS ARE NOT VERY STRONG IT JUST MIGHT BE THAT YOUR STOMACH GETS HARD
GD5-_-fIAOg_27 0 THAT'S YOUR UTERUS CONTRACTING
GD5-_-fIAOg_28 0 AND THEN AS YOUR UTERUS RELAX THAT YOUR STOMACH IS GOING TO GET SOFT AGAIN
GD5-_-fIAOg_29 0 SO A GREAT WAY TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE TRULY IN LABOR IS WHEN YOU HAVE CONTRACTIONS THAT GET CLOSER TOGETHER AND LAST LONGER

GAo8YNxBwFc_3 0 THIS IS DANIEL KLAPHEKE FROM ELITE MARTIAL ARTS OF MIDDLE TENNESSEE FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
GAo8YNxBwFc_4 0 THIS IS AN ESCAPE FROM FRONT TIGHT CLINCH
GAo8YNxBwFc_6 0 JASON JEANETTE ALL RIGHT HE'S SWIMMING THROUGH MY PUNCHES TO A CLINCH
GAo8YNxBwFc_7 0 I THROW A JAB CROSS
GAo8YNxBwFc_8 0 HE'S PULLING ME DOWN ONE TWO THREE FOUR PULLS THE BACK OF MY HEAD DOWN WITH A GOOD PULL
GAo8YNxBwFc_9 0 HE'S SQUEEZING MY NECK WITH HIS ELBOWS
GAo8YNxBwFc_10 0 AND HERE I'M GOING TO IMMEDIATELY DEFEND THE KNEES
GAo8YNxBwFc_11 0 WHEN I CAN TIME IT OUT I'LL START JUST LIKE A REGULAR REVERSAL WHERE I SWIM BOTH MY HANDS THROUGH
GAo8YNxBwFc_12 0 SO WHEN WE'RE GOING TO DO HALF OF THAT SO WE'LL SWIM ONE THROUGH POP THE ELBOW UP AND MY HEAD UNDERNEATH REALLY TIGHT
GAo8YNxBwFc_13 0 NOW AT THIS POINT MY HEAD IS MY MOST IMPORTANT APPENDAGE HERE
GAo8YNxBwFc_14 0 I WANT TO TRY TO TOUCH MY HEAD TO HIS HEAD
GAo8YNxBwFc_16 0 FOR PRACTICE I CAN LOCK UP A TIGHT CHOKE BY GRABBING MY EAR
GAo8YNxBwFc_17 0 IN THE FIGHT I'VE GOT EYE GOUGES HERE
GAo8YNxBwFc_18 0 SO I CAN SCRAMBLE ON HIS FACE
GAo8YNxBwFc_19 0 I CAN THROW KNEES AND TRY TO LOCK DOWN AND FINISH IT OR MY OTHER OPTION IS TO STEP BEHIND
GAo8YNxBwFc_20 0 AND I DON'T WANT TO SLAM HIM ON THE MAT CAUSE THAT WILL LOOSEN UP MY CHOKE
GAo8YNxBwFc_21 0 I JUST WANT TO BRING HIM WHERE I'M [INDISCERNIBLE] ON THE FLOOR
GAo8YNxBwFc_22 0 WHAT I CAN DO FROM HERE I'M JUST GOING TO WALK MY FEET OUT TOWARDS THE DIRECTION OF HIS HEAD POINTING TO LOCK UP A TIGHT CHOKE
gKedb-Yc-zI_1 0 ANOTHER WAY TO USE COME NOT JUST FOR JUMPS IS TO HAVE A GAME OUT ON THE TRAIL WHERE YOU CAN HAVE THEM JUMP UP ON ROCKS HAVE THEM JUMP UP ON A WIDE FENCE IF YOUR DOG IS NIMBLE ENOUGH AND TO JUST HAVE SOME FUN WITH THAT
gKedb-Yc-zI_2 0 IT WORKS THEIR BRAIN AS WELL AS THEIR BODIES AND IT INCREASES THE BOND BETWEEN YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE WORKING TOGETHER
gKedb-Yc-zI_3 0 SO FOR KARMA WE'RE GOING TO USE THIS STEP INSTEAD OF A BOULDER SINCE THERE'S NOT ANY IN THE YARD
gKedb-Yc-zI_7 0 NOW AS YOU SEE I'M ALMOST MAKING AN OBSTACLE COURSE
gKedb-Yc-zI_8 0 I'M HAVING HER GET UP ON THE BOULDER
gKedb-Yc-zI_9 0 I'M BACKING UP HAVING HER COME AGAIN
gKedb-Yc-zI_10 0 YOU'LL NOTICE I'M NOT NECESSARILY HAVING HER TURN AROUND TO ME IN THIS VERSION OF COME BUT I AM EXPECTING HER TO COME STRAIGHT TO ME AND TO SIT
GmelGhzG0iQ_1 0 WHAT ARE THE PARENT EXPECTATIONS OF TUTORING
GmelGhzG0iQ_2 0 A LOT OF PARENTS WILL EXPECT OF COURSE WHEN THEY MAKE AN INITIAL CALL TO A TUTORING COMPANY THEY WANT TO IMPROVE THEIR KID'S GRADE OR AT LEAST GIVE THEIR KID MORE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR ABILITIES TO GO AHEAD AND GET THEIR OWN GOOD GRADE
GmelGhzG0iQ_3 0 THAT IS WHAT THEY START OUT WITH
GmelGhzG0iQ_4 0 A LOT OF TIMES IN HIGH SCHOOL THE STUDENT DOES NOT WANT TO PUT THAT MUCH EFFORT INTO IT AND SO OF COURSE IT BECOMES MORE OF A GAME OF DISCIPLINE OR BABYSITTING AND AT THAT POINT YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO AT LEAST GET AN IMPROVEMENT AND AT LEAST A PASSING GRADE
GmelGhzG0iQ_5 0 OF COURSE NO ONE WANTS TO WORK THAT WAY THEY WANT TO WORK YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO GET AS MUCH AS YOU CAN DONE IN THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME POSSIBLE YOU WANT TO BE EFFICIENT AND GET THEM A'S THEY WANT TO GET A'S
GmelGhzG0iQ_7 0 SO A PARENT'S EXPECTATION IS THAT THEIR KID'S GRADE IS GOING TO IMPROVE GENERALLY
GmelGhzG0iQ_8 0 A LOT OF TIMES CERTAIN TUTORING COMPANIES WILL GUARANTEE THAT SOME WILL NOT
GmelGhzG0iQ_9 0 BUT IT IS BY AND LARGE IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT ALWAYS HAPPENS
GmelGhzG0iQ_10 0 YOU CANNOT YOU CANNOT GO AHEAD AND TUTOR SOMEONE AND THEN NOT GET PAID FOR THE TIME THAT YOU SPENT WHILE THE KID WAS OFF SMOKING POT IN YOU KNOW HOMEROOM
GmelGhzG0iQ_11 0 THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT THAT
GmelGhzG0iQ_12 0 IF THEY HAVE GOT A BAD KID THEY HAVE GOT A BAD KID
GmelGhzG0iQ_13 0 THEY OWE YOU MONEY FOR YOUR TIME
GmelGhzG0iQ_14 0 THAT IS SOMETHING THAT USUALLY I WILL DISCUSS WITH THE PARENT BEFOREHAND AND DEFINITELY THE STUDENT SAYING I DO NOT WANT TO BE DISCIPLINARIAN YOU HAVE GOT TO DISCIPLINE YOURSELF IF YOU WANT THIS GOOD GRADE YOU ARE GOING TO DO THE GOOD JOB THAT YOU ARE GOING TO PAY ATTENTION YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME QUESTIONS YOU ARE GOING TO SYNTHESIZE YOUR OWN PICTURE OF WHAT THIS CONCEPT IS AND THAT IS GOING TO BE THE EXTENT OF IT
GmelGhzG0iQ_15 0 AND THE SAME THING WITH THE PARENTS
GmelGhzG0iQ_16 0 I AM NOT GOING TO BE THE DISCIPLINARIAN YOU HAVE TO BE THE DISCIPLINARIAN
GmelGhzG0iQ_17 0 IF YOUR KID IS NOT DOING THEIR HOMEWORK THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET GOOD GRADES THAT IS NOT MY FAULT THEY NEED TO PUT IN THE EFFORT I CAN ONLY MEET THEM SO FAR HALF-WAYISH
GmelGhzG0iQ_18 0 THOSE ARE THE PARENT EXPECTATIONS
GmelGhzG0iQ_19 0 THOSE ARE HOW I DEAL WITH THE PARENTS EXPECTATIONS OF TUTORING
HdyinId6Uzs_1 0 A GREAT VARIATION OF THE HALF-CAB KICKFLIP IS TO LEARN THE NOLLIE VARIATION
HdyinId6Uzs_2 0 NOLLIE HALF-CAB KICKFLIP IS WHEN YOU RIDE IN THE NOLLIE POSITION NOLLIE 180-FILP FRONTSIDE AND LAND FAKIE AND KEEP ROLLING
HdyinId6Uzs_3 0 AND TURN THAT INTO A FAKIE ROLL
HdyinId6Uzs_4 0 THE NOLLIE FRONTSIDE 180-FLIP IS GOING TO REQUIRE YOU TO BE ABLE TO HAVE NOLLIE 180S PRETTY COMFORTABLY
HdyinId6Uzs_5 0 AND THEN COMBINE THE NOLLIE FLIP AND THE NOLLIE 180 TOGETHER
HdyinId6Uzs_6 0 SO THE NOLLIE 180-FLIP IS LIKE THIS
HdyinId6Uzs_7 0 YOU SET UP WITH YOUR FOOT IN A NOLLIE POSITION WITH YOUR TIP OF THE TOE ON THE BOARD SO THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO GET MAXIMUM ABILITY TO NOLLIE IN HEIGHT
HdyinId6Uzs_8 0 YOUR BACK FOOT IS GOING TO BE PLACED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOARD WITH YOUR TOE KIND OF SLIGHTLY OUT
HdyinId6Uzs_9 0 AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS HIT THE NOSE YOUR FOOT'S GOING TO CONTINUE UP THE BOARD AND FLIP THE BOARD 180 AND THEN LAND IN THE FAKIE POSITION
HdyinId6Uzs_10 0 YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO WANT TO KIND OF HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE HALF-CAB FLIP BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO BE ABLE TO KNOW HOW TO FLIP AND A TIMING IS REQUIRED FOR THIS TRICK
HdyinId6Uzs_11 0 AND THEN WHAT YOU DO IS TAKE THAT TRICK AND IMAGINE IT BACKWARDS AND THEN YOU'RE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO NOLLIE 180-FLIP
GisvdwnTIHo_1 0 I'M JAMAL SPENCER FOR EXPERT VILLAGE HERE AT ABC THREE HERE IN LANSING AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL SPORTS BROADCASTER
GisvdwnTIHo_2 0 THIS CLIP IS ABOUT INTERNING IN A SPORTS DEPARTMENT
GisvdwnTIHo_3 0 AS AN INTERN A LOT OF PEOPLE GET THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE GETTING COFFEE AND PICKING UP THE BOSSES DRY-CLEANING AND THAT MAY BE TRUE
GisvdwnTIHo_4 0 SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE AN INTERN YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF HOW BAD YOU WANT TO BRING IT TO THE INDUSTRY
GisvdwnTIHo_5 0 SOME BOSSES ARE JERKS AND THEY'LL HAVE YOU DO GRUNT JOBS AND KEEP YOU FROM ACTUALLY LEARNING
GisvdwnTIHo_6 0 A LOT OF PLACES ARE HANDS ON WHERE YOU'LL GO OUT AND YOU'LL DO A STORY ON YOUR FIRST WEEK ON THE JOB
GisvdwnTIHo_7 0 SO AS AN INTERN YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE MENTALITY EXPECT EVERYTHING I'LL BE ABLE TO HANDLE ANYTHING SO THAT WAY YOU'LL BE A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE IF ANYTHING COMES UP
GisvdwnTIHo_8 0 NOW AS AN INTERN YOU WILL BE GIVEN JOBS LIKE TYPING
GisvdwnTIHo_9 0 GO DO THIS
GisvdwnTIHo_10 0 YOU'LL BE GIVEN THE GRUNT WORK THAT THE PEOPLE THAT USED TO BE INTERNS DON'T WANT TO DO ANYMORE
GisvdwnTIHo_11 0 SO AS A SPORTS INTERN BE PREPARED TO DO ALL THE GRUNT WORK BUT KNOW THAT THE BENEFITS WILL BE GREAT
GisvdwnTIHo_12 0 QUITE OFTEN A REPORTER WILL SAY HEY I WANT TO TAKE YOU ON THIS STORY AND YOU'LL MEET FAMOUS PEOPLE ON YOUR FIRST DAY ON THE JOB
GisvdwnTIHo_13 0 SO KEEP THAT IN MIND
GisvdwnTIHo_14 0 YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO ACT AS AN INTERN NOT TO GO WOW THERE'S JERRY RICE
GisvdwnTIHo_15 0 YOU HAVE TO BE POISED AND KEEP IT UNDER CONTROL BUT YOU WILL BE VERY EXCITED
GisvdwnTIHo_16 0 THAT'S THE BEST PART ABOUT BEING AN INTERN IS THAT EVERYTHING IS NEW
GisvdwnTIHo_17 0 SO AS A SPORTS INTERN YOU WILL BE TAKING ON STORIES YOU WILL BE GIVEN THE GRUNT WORK BUT IT WILL ALL PAY OFF BECAUSE SOONER OR NOT YOU'RE HARD WORK WILL PAY OFF YOU'LL BE SUCCESSFUL
GisvdwnTIHo_18 0 THEY WILL REALIZE THAT HEY THIS KID CAN REPORT THIS KID CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE ASK HIM TO DO AND YOU'LL BE SUCCESSFUL
GisvdwnTIHo_19 0 SO AS AN INTERN REMEMBER YOU MAY START OFF DOING THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO DO BUT YOU WILL END UP WHERE YOU WANT TO BE
gHIqSh3NGHc_1 0 NEXT WE ARE GOING TO PUT THE JACK STANDS IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE SAFE WHEN WE ARE UNDER THE VEHICLE WHILE DOING THE OIL CHANGE
gHIqSh3NGHc_2 0 YOU CAN USE SIX TON JACK STAND FOUR TON JACK STAND
gHIqSh3NGHc_3 0 THE LIGHTER ONES WOULD BE A LITTLE SMALLER
gHIqSh3NGHc_4 0 THEY ARE ALL SUITABLE TO DO THE JOB
gHIqSh3NGHc_5 0 YOU WANT TO PLACE THESE EITHER UNDER YOUR FRAME WHEEL ENGINE CRADLE
gHIqSh3NGHc_6 0 SOME PLACE AGAIN THAT IS REALLY SOLID WILL SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE AND IS A PLACE THAT WON'T DO ANY DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE OR ANY OF THE VEHICLE COMPONENTS AS WELL
gHIqSh3NGHc_7 0 SO WE ARE JUST GOING TO SLIDE THIS UNDER HERE
gHIqSh3NGHc_8 0 ON THIS VEHICLE THERE IS ACTUALLY A BRACE STRUCTURAL BRACE THAT COMES OUT ON EACH SIDE OF THE FRAME AND THAT IS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PLACE OUR JACK STAND RIGHT UNDER THERE
H0LHHbt00-E_2 0 I'M GARY FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
H0LHHbt00-E_3 0 NOW LET'S STARTING PUTTING TAPE ACROSS THE BOOK
H0LHHbt00-E_4 0 I CHOSE MY THIN TAPE
H0LHHbt00-E_5 0 THE FIRST PLACE I AM GOING TO PUT THE TAPE IS ACROSS THE TOP HERE
H0LHHbt00-E_6 0 THIS GIVES THIS PART SUPPORT WHERE IT USUALLY STARTS TO RIP AND WE JUST PUT A STRIP ACROSS JUST LIKE WE DID OVER HERE
H0LHHbt00-E_7 0 YOU CAN SEE THERE IS A STRIP GOING ACROSS HERE AND IT ALSO HAS A NICE CLEAN LOOK WHEN WE PUT THE TAPE DOWN THE SIDES
H0LHHbt00-E_8 0 IT GIVES A NICE CLEAN LOOK WHEN WE PUT ON TOP AS WELL
H0LHHbt00-E_9 0 SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND DO THAT
H0LHHbt00-E_10 0 WE TAKE OUR TAPE AND FOR THAT WE WILL NEED ABOUT TWO 1/2 INCHES
H0LHHbt00-E_11 0 SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TAPE
H0LHHbt00-E_12 0 DON'T PUT IT EXACTLY ON THE END BUT WE NEED TO LEAVE IT OVER A LITTLE BIT PROBABLY ABOUT HALF THE WIDTH OF THE TAPE AND THAT IS GOING TO BE TUCKED IN INTO THE BOTTOM AND GIVE IT MORE WHERE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT
H0LHHbt00-E_13 0 WE ARE GOING TO TUCK IT INTO THE SPINE AND THAT WILL PREVENT THE TAPE IF WE PUT IT RIGHT TO THE TOP
H0LHHbt00-E_14 0 SOMETIMES THE TAPE STARTS TO COME OFF AND GET STICKY
H0LHHbt00-E_15 0 THIS WAY IT IS GOING TO BE NICE AND CLEAN
H0LHHbt00-E_16 0 IT IS GOING TO OVER THE TOP AND WE ARE GOING TO TUCK IT INSIDE SO YOU WON'T EVEN SEE THE EDGES
H0LHHbt00-E_17 0 NOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IN ORDER TO MAKE IT EASIER TO TUCK INSIDE AT THE EDGE WHERE THE CONTINUATION OF THE BOOK WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A LITTLE SNIP AND THE TAPE WILL HAVE ITS GROOVES OVER HERE AND ALSO ON THE OTHER SIDE
H0LHHbt00-E_18 0 NOW THE TAPE IS ACTUALLY INTO THREE DIFFERENT STRIPS AND THAT WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO OPEN UP AND WE CAN FOLD IT DOWN
H0LHHbt00-E_19 0 ONE WILL GO DOWN INTO THIS SIDE AND THE OTHER ONE WILL GO DOWN THE BACK COVER
H0LHHbt00-E_20 0 THERE'S A SPACE HERE BETWEEN THE HARD COVER ON THE BACK AND YOU SEE THIS YELLOW RIBBON WHICH IS WHAT IS HOLDING THE PAGES TOGETHER
H0LHHbt00-E_21 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID TO JUST PULL IT OUT A LITTLE BIT SO YOU SEE A SPACE
H0LHHbt00-E_22 0 I TAKE MY KNIFE AND I USE THE VERY SHARP PART OF IT BECAUSE IT WILL JUST POKE HOLES BUT I USE THAT TO KIND OF SEPARATE IT AND TUCK IT DOWN IN BETWEEN THAT PART OF THE HARD COVER AND WHERE THE PAGES ARE
H0LHHbt00-E_23 0 I JUST VERY LIGHT VERY GENTLY SO IT DOESN'T RIP THE TAPE
H0LHHbt00-E_24 0 I JUST KIND OF STUFF IT IN THERE

g-edzoAHhmU_3 0 A LOT OF INDOOR FACILITIES LIKE TO WORK IN AN HOUR TO HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTE SCHEDULE PER GAME
g-edzoAHhmU_4 0 IT KIND OF KEEPS THINGS GOING
g-edzoAHhmU_5 0 THE REASON WHY IT'S SO STRUCTURED IN THE FACT THAT 25 MINUTES FIVE MINUTES 25 MINUTES AND FIVE MINUTES IN BETWEEN ADD THAT UP AND IT'S ONE HOUR
g-edzoAHhmU_6 0 IT GIVES YOU SOME FLEXIBILITY IF YOU DECIDE TO GO OVER THE FIFTEEN MINUTES WHETHER A TEAM IS HERE ON TIME OR NOT BUT THEY USUALLY LIKE TO GET THINGS STARTED RIGHT WHEN THE TIME OF THE GAME IS SCHEDULED AND THEY USUALLY LIKE TO END IT RIGHT WHEN THE TIME OF THE GAME IS SCHEDULED
g-edzoAHhmU_7 0 THERE IS A RUNNING CLOCK THE WHOLE TIME
g-edzoAHhmU_8 0 THEY DON'T STOP THE CLOCK LIKE THEY DO IN INDOOR AFTER GOALS OR AFTER RED CARDS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
g-edzoAHhmU_9 0 IT'S A RUNNING CLOCK THE WHOLE TIME AND IT USUALLY LASTS ABOUT AN HOUR OF DURATION WITH WARM-UP TWO HALVES AND A HALF-TIME
G9hMjns6FbY_1 0 NOW THAT I HAVE FOUR CORNERS LAID OUT IN MY JIG I CAN REMOVE MY BLOCK OF WOOD AND FAIRLY EASILY PLACE IT BACK INTO MY JIG
G9hMjns6FbY_2 0 AND I CAN TEST IT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO MOVE AROUND TOO MUCH

gpRipY_7ekc_3 0 I ALWAYS START MY STUDENTS ON THE FLOOR SO THAT THEY CAN GET A FEEL FOR HOW TO GRAB THE POLE WITH THEIR LEGS

gpRipY_7ekc_7 0 YOUR LEFT LEG IS GOING TO COME UP BENT SO IT'S AROUND THE POLE AND HOOK THE POLE WITH THE TOP OF YOUR FOOT
gpRipY_7ekc_8 0 SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WHEN WE GO UPSIDE DOWN STANDING UP
gpRipY_7ekc_9 0 SO WHEN YOU START YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GRAB THE POLE KIND OF GRAB THE POLE LOW
gpRipY_7ekc_10 0 IF YOU GO TOO HIGH THAT JUST MEANS YOUR LEGS HAVE TO KICK THAT MUCH HIGHER AND WHEN YOU'RE BEGINNING YOU WANT TO START LOW
gpRipY_7ekc_11 0 SO JUST PUT YOUR HANDS BASEBALL GRAB RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR FOREHEAD
gpRipY_7ekc_12 0 YOU'RE GOING TO STEP WITH YOUR LEFT FOOT KICK YOUR RIGHT FOOT UP AND THEN CATCH THE POLE THERE WITH YOUR ANKLE LIKE I SHOWED BEFORE
gpRipY_7ekc_13 0 SO THIS IS HOW IT GOES
gpRipY_7ekc_14 0 AND THEN ADVANCED DANCERS CAN ACTUALLY BRING THEIR ARMS AROUND GRAB THE POLE FRONT WAYS AND LET GO WITH THEIR ARMS
gpRipY_7ekc_15 0 THIS GENERALLY TAKES ABOUT TWO TO THREE MONTHS TO DEVELOP THE LEG MUSCLES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO THAT
gpRipY_7ekc_16 0 BUT FOR NOW JUST GO TO THE REGULAR INVERT AND SLIDE DOWN
gR14RgRGXLU_1 0 OKAY THERE'S TWO TABS
gR14RgRGXLU_2 0 THESE TWO TABS RIGHT HERE
gR14RgRGXLU_3 0 YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE LINED UP ON THESE TWO RUBBER INSERTS HERE
gR14RgRGXLU_4 0 IF THEY'RE NOT ON IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO WORK RIGHT
gR14RgRGXLU_5 0 OKAY SO THERE'S THAT ONE AND THERE'S THAT ONE
gR14RgRGXLU_6 0 THEN IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIGHTENING UP THAT SCREW
gR14RgRGXLU_7 0 AND THERE SHE GOES
gR14RgRGXLU_8 0 JUST SNUG HER UP
gR14RgRGXLU_9 0 DON'T OVER TIGHTEN IT
gR14RgRGXLU_10 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO ABUSE YOUR EQUIPMENT
gR14RgRGXLU_11 0 TAKE CARE OF YOUR EQUIPMENT AND IT WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU
gR14RgRGXLU_12 0 OKAY NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NEXT IS WE'RE GOING TO CONNECT THE BATTERY TERMINALS HERE
gR14RgRGXLU_13 0 AND SO I'LL JUST GRAB MY TEN MILLIMETER AND WE'LL COME UP HERE AND WE WILL CONNECT THE POSITIVE CABLE
gR14RgRGXLU_14 0 OKAY JUST ALWAYS FINGER START IT
gR14RgRGXLU_15 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO CROSS-THREAD IT THE PRICE OF THE BATTERIES
gR14RgRGXLU_16 0 YOU DON'T NEED ANY KIND OF UNNECESSARY GRIEF
gR14RgRGXLU_17 0 SO GO AHEAD AND SNUG THAT UP
gR14RgRGXLU_18 0 AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE WORKING AROUND THE BATTERY ANY TYPE OF LIVE WIRE I ALWAYS RECOMMEND YOU TAKE OFF YOUR RING YOU TAKE OFF YOUR WATCH
gR14RgRGXLU_19 0 I'VE WORKED AROUND MECHANICS AND I'VE SEEN SOME BAD THINGS HAPPEN BY SHORTING THAT CROSSED
gR14RgRGXLU_20 0 ALWAYS THINK SAFETY FIRST
gR14RgRGXLU_21 0 NOTHING IS THAT IMPORTANT THAT IT CAN'T BE DONE TAKE TIME TO BE DONE THE RIGHT WAY AND BE DONE SAFELY
gR14RgRGXLU_22 0 OKAY SO THERE WE HAVE IT
gR14RgRGXLU_23 0 AND WE'LL GO AHEAD AND PUT THAT ON THERE FOR PROTECTION
gLxrMPVZhsQ_1 0 CLANCY ROSE ALRIGHTY SO NOW THAT YOU KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO FOR TO PREPARE AN ESPRESSO WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TWO OTHER THINGS THAT GO INTO PREPARING AN ESPRESSO AND THAT IS THE GRINDER AND THE BEANS
gLxrMPVZhsQ_2 0 FIRST OF ALL THE BEANS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT ESPRESSO IS THAT THE ROAST FOR THE ESPRESSO OR THE ESPRESSO BLEND IS DARKER THAN NORMAL COFFEE WHICH IS UNNECESSARILY TRUE WHICH MEANS THAT YOU CAN USE WHATEVER COFFEE THAT YOU LIKE
gLxrMPVZhsQ_3 0 THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS IS ANY FLAVORS THAT ARE THAT ARE IN THE BEANS ARE BROUGHT OUT ARE EVEN MORE INTENSE IN A CUP OF ESPRESSO AND THAT IS BECAUSE OF THEIR RATHER THAN A NORMAL CUP OF COFFEE THE RATIOS OF COFFEE TO HOT WATER GROUND COFFEE TO HOT WATER IS MUCH HIGHER
g5s6_DR45Ls_1 0 I'M WORKING ON PAM'S LEGS THIS AFTERNOON
g5s6_DR45Ls_2 0 AND WE ARE GOING TO DO AN HOUR WORTH OF WORK ON PAM'S LEGS
g5s6_DR45Ls_3 0 SO I AM GOING TO START ON THE LEFT SIDE OF HER LEGS
g5s6_DR45Ls_4 0 BUT WHEN I GET A MAN COMING IN AND HE'S REALLY HAIRY LEGS
g5s6_DR45Ls_5 0 I WILL TRIM I'LL GET A CLIPPER OUT OR SCISSORS AND I'LL COMB THAT HAIR UP AND I'LL DO A SECTION WHAT EVER THE TIME THAT HE IS BUYING
g5s6_DR45Ls_6 0 LIKE SAY FOR EXAMPLE HE'S DOING AN HOUR WORTH OF WORK I PRETTY MUCH KNOW WHAT I CAN ACCOMPLISH IN AN HOUR
g5s6_DR45Ls_7 0 SO THAT ONE AREA AND I'LL DO AND I'LL START IN AREAS THAT ARE NOT NOTICEABLE LIKE THE BACK OF THE LEG
g5s6_DR45Ls_8 0 AND I'LL WORK MY WAY THROUGH THAT AREA UNTIL THAT IS CLEARED AND THEN DO PART ON EACH SIDE OF THE LEG YOU KNOW I'LL CLEAR A SECTION HERE AND I WILL BE GOING TO A SECTION HERE
g5s6_DR45Ls_9 0 AND UP WHERE HE COULD WEAR SHORTS AND THOSE THINGS ARE THOUGHT OF BEFORE I BEGIN
g5s6_DR45Ls_10 0 BUT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I HAVE TO PREPARE FOR WHEN I HAVE A CLIENT WITH BIG HAIRY LEGS
g5s6_DR45Ls_11 0 AND THEN I HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE LIGHT WISPY LEGS THE HAIR
g5s6_DR45Ls_12 0 THAN I WOULD TAKE THAT LIGHT AND AIM IT CROSS LIGHT SO I CAN PICK UP THAT TRANSLUCENT HAIR AND SEE IT REAL CLEARLY
g5s6_DR45Ls_13 0 THERE'S ALL KIND OF CONSIDERATION THAT I HAVE TO HAVE WITH CLIENTS
g5s6_DR45Ls_14 0 AND I WILL NOT TREAT A PREGNANT WOMEN UNLESS SHE HAS A DOCTORS NOTE THAT IS ONE CONSIDERATION
g5s6_DR45Ls_15 0 AND THEN I TAKE HEALTH HISTORY IF THEY ARE DIABETIC OR THEY ARE BLEEDERS OR DIFFERENT SITUATIONS THAT I HAVE TO YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT BEFORE I DO THE WORK
haBb4YMyU6o_1 0 HI THIS IS DAVID FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE ARE MAKING CAJUN RATATOUILLE
haBb4YMyU6o_2 0 SO NOW THAT THE ONIONS HAVE BEEN SHOCKED HERE IN A BATH WE ARE GOING TO PEEL THESE

haBb4YMyU6o_4 0 SO NOW THAT YOU HAVE THIS END CUT OFF AND YOU SEE THIS IS GOING TO COME OFF PRETTY EASILY
haBb4YMyU6o_5 0 THAT SKIN JUST LIKE THAT YOU SEE HOW THIN THAT SKIN IS ANYWAYS
haBb4YMyU6o_6 0 THAT IS GOING TO COME RIGHT OFF
haBb4YMyU6o_7 0 IF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE RAW YOU WOULD LOSE HALF OF YOUR ONION IN THE PROCESS
haBb4YMyU6o_8 0 SO I'M JUST GOING TO CONTINUE DOING THIS AND THAT IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO WITH ALL OF THEM
gblMsZ2QOcM_1 0 REBECCA SATO HI
gblMsZ2QOcM_2 0 I'M REBECCA WITH EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
gblMsZ2QOcM_3 0 AND WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT PORTFOLIOS BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL ASK WELL HOW DO YOU GET YOUR VERY FIRST WRITING SAMPLE
gblMsZ2QOcM_4 0 THAT ISN'T JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU WROTE BUT IT'S ACTUALLY PUBLISHED
gblMsZ2QOcM_5 0 SO YOU CAN SHOW IT TO SOMEONE A PROSPECTIVE CLIENT AND SAY I WROTE THIS AND IT WAS PUBLISHED
gblMsZ2QOcM_6 0 WELL YOU HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE
gblMsZ2QOcM_7 0 SO I'LL JUST TELL YOU WHAT WORKED FOR ME AND THEN YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT AS YOU GO
gblMsZ2QOcM_8 0 BUT SOMETIMES YOU CAN START SMALL AND USE THESE SMALL PROJECTS THAT DON'T PAY WELL
gblMsZ2QOcM_9 0 MAYBE IT IS LITTLE PAY MAYBE IT'S A LOT OF WORK AND YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GETTING THE CREDIT YOU DESERVE
gblMsZ2QOcM_10 0 I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND DOING THAT FOR VERY LONG
gblMsZ2QOcM_11 0 BUT I RECOMMEND DOING IT A COUPLE OF WEEKS UNTIL YOU HAVE A FEW DECENT SAMPLES AND THEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN START ASKING FOR BETTER PAY FOR BIGGER JOBS
gblMsZ2QOcM_12 0 SO ONE WAY I BROKE IN WAS WHEN I FIRST DECIDED THAT I REALLY WANTED TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT FREELANCE WRITING I JUST WENT AND LOOKED AND SAW WHAT WAS OUT THERE
gblMsZ2QOcM_13 0 AND I NOTICED AND I WAS CAREFUL TO NOT LOOK FOR PROJECTS THAT WE'RE JUST WAY BEYOND MY EXPERTISE AND MY EXPERIENCE
gblMsZ2QOcM_14 0 I THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC
gblMsZ2QOcM_15 0 BUT I NOTICED THAT THEY NEEDED A WRITER TO COVER THE SLAMDANCE FILM FESTIVAL
gblMsZ2QOcM_16 0 AND THE SLAMDANCE FILM FESTIVAL RUNS CONCURRENT WITH THE SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL WHICH IS A BIG DEAL
gblMsZ2QOcM_17 0 BUT SLAMDANCE IS BECOMING A BIG DEAL TOO BUT IT'S KIND OF MORE FUN AND INDIE AND THEY WEREN'T A GOOD WRITER BUT YOU DON'T DIDN'T HAVE TO BE PUBLISHED IN ALL THESE AMAZING PLACES BEFORE THEY CONSIDER YOU
gblMsZ2QOcM_18 0 SO I ACTUALLY ENDED UP JUST SENDING THEM A FEW LITTLE SAMPLES THAT I'VE ALREADY DONE AND THEY LIKED MY WRITING AND THEY GAVE ME A JOB
gblMsZ2QOcM_19 0 SO I WENT OUT THERE
gblMsZ2QOcM_20 0 I INTERVIEWED PEOPLE AND I WROTE SOME ARTICLES ABOUT THE SLAMDANCE EXPERIENCE AND I DID SOME MOVIE REVIEWS
gblMsZ2QOcM_21 0 SO THAT GAVE ME SOME GREAT CLIPS TO START WITH
gblMsZ2QOcM_22 0 THAT WAS NICE
gblMsZ2QOcM_23 0 AND THEN FROM THERE I ACTUALLY MOVED ON TO WRITING COPY FOR A COSMETIC COMPANY AND THAT WASN'T MY DREAM JOB TO BE WRITING ABOUT HOW THIS LIPSTICK WAS GOING TO MAKE YOUR LIPS LUSCIOUS AND GLOW BUT IT WAS A SPRINGBOARD FOR OTHER JOBS
gblMsZ2QOcM_24 0 YOU CAN SAY HERE I'VE BEEN PUBLISHED IN THIS COSMETIC CATALOG AND WHATNOT AND I'VE WRITTEN A GOOD COPY
gblMsZ2QOcM_25 0 AND THEY COULD SEE THAT I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING
gblMsZ2QOcM_26 0 I KNEW HOW TO WRITE
gblMsZ2QOcM_27 0 AND IF YOU'RE A GOOD WRITER YOU CAN JUST WRITE ABOUT ANYTHING
gt8bTw8IUYU_1 0 FOR BIKES THAT DON'T HAVE QUICK RELEASE LIKE THIS IT BASICALLY LOOKS LIKE THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS DUAL LEVER IT IS JUST A BOLT THE BOLT IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND NOT THE LEFT SIDE LIKE THIS ONE CAUSE THERE IS A LEVER ON THE OTHER SIDE
gt8bTw8IUYU_2 0 BUT WE WOULD STICK A TOOL IN THERE AND WE WOULD LOWER OR RAISE THE SEAT HEIGHT
gt8bTw8IUYU_3 0 SO I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS IS A FOUR MILLIMETER WRENCH I'M GOING TO LOOSEN IT SO I CAN ADJUST THE SEAT HEIGHT AND THERE WE GO
gt8bTw8IUYU_4 0 SO FINDING THE RIGHT SEAT HEIGHT IS ANOTHER MATTER ENTIRELY
gt8bTw8IUYU_5 0 WHAT I LIKE TO DO AS JUST A RULE OF THUMB I LIKE TO FIND SOMETHING TO LEAN AGAINST GET BACK ON THE BIKE AND WHEN YOU ARE WEARING THE SHORTS OR PANTS THAT YOU RIDE IN THE SHOES THAT YOU RIDE IN AND I DON'T USUALLY RIDE IN THESE PANTS OR SHOES
gt8bTw8IUYU_6 0 WHAT I DO IS LOOK FOR THE APPROPRIATE KNEE ANGLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PEDAL STROKE WHICH IS ABOUT THE ANGLE I HAVE HERE LIKE A TWENTY 25 DEGREE ANGLE
gt8bTw8IUYU_7 0 I CAN PROBABLY LOWER MY SEAT A LITTLE BIT BUT WHEN YOU LOWER YOUR SEAT TO MUCH YOU END UP HAVING A PRETTY UNCOMFORTABLE RIDING POSITION
gt8bTw8IUYU_8 0 IT IS NOT AS EFFICIENT YOU SORT OF HURT YOUR KNEES AND ALL THAT GOOD STUFF
gt8bTw8IUYU_9 0 SEAT TO HIGH ALSO NOT EFFICIENT ALSO RIGHT FOR INJURY
gt8bTw8IUYU_10 0 THE BEST WAY TO MEASURE SEAT HEIGHT IS THE TAPE MEASURE MEASURING IT CONSISTENTLY FROM THE CENTER OF THE BOTTOM BRACKET WHICH IS THAT BOLT RIGHT THERE TO THE CENTER OF THE SEAT TUBE
gt8bTw8IUYU_11 0 I LIKE TO MEASURE IT STARTING FROM THE TEN MILLIMETER MARK JUST LINE THAT UP TO THE CENTER OF THE BOLT AND THEN UP TO THE CENTER OF THE SADDLE
gt8bTw8IUYU_12 0 IT LOOKS LIKE I SET MY SEAT RIGHT JUST BY GUESSING THERE CAUSE I LIKE TO RIDE A 73.25 MILLIMETERS SEAT HEIGHT AND THAT IS WHAT WE GOT
gt8bTw8IUYU_13 0 SO DON'T RUN YOUR SEAT TO HIGH TRY TO RECORD OR REMEMBER WHAT YOUR MEASUREMENTS ARE ENCASE YOU HAVE TO MESS WITH THINGS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR SEAT NICE AND LEVEL AND GET OUT THERE AND HAVE A GOOD RIDE
h7qrdtKscoQ_1 0 HI I'M THE STAR GODDESS AND HERE ARE SOME TIPS FOR DATING THE CANCER MAN
h7qrdtKscoQ_2 0 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER ABOUT CANCER MEN ARE THESE ARE THE MOST SENSITIVE MEN IN THE ZODIAC REPRESENTED BY A CREATURE THAT HAS NO VOCAL CORDS CANCER MEN HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME ARTICULATING WHAT THEIR WANTS AND NEEDS ARE
h7qrdtKscoQ_3 0 SO FOR YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL WHEN DATING THEM YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT ALTHOUGH YOU THINK THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A MATE OR A PARTNER WHAT THEY'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR IS SOMEONE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM AND MEET THEIR EVERY EMOTIONAL NEED
h7qrdtKscoQ_4 0 THESE GUYS ARE LOOKING FOR MOMS SO THE BEST WAY TO DATE A CANCER MAN IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR DATES INCLUDE PLENTY OF EATING DRINKING SENSUAL WATER SPORTS BECAUSE THEY REALLY ENJOY BATHS AND BUBBLES AND TO BE ROMANTIC BECAUSE THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST ROMANTIC GUYS IN THE ZODIAC
h7qrdtKscoQ_5 0 WHATEVER YOU DO WHEN YOU ARE WITH YOUR CANCER MAN MAKE SURE YOU ARE FINDING A WAY TO INDULGE HIM HIS WANTS AND HIS NEEDS
h7qrdtKscoQ_6 0 OF COURSE THAT WORKS WELL WITH MOST SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO CATCH YOUR CANCER MAN MAKE HIM THE MOST FABULOUS DISH THAT YOU CAN COOK AND YOU'LL FIND THAT ONCE HE IS AT YOUR TABLE HE WON'T LEAVE
h7qrdtKscoQ_7 0 THAT'S THE CLUE TO DATING YOUR CANCER MAN
h7qrdtKscoQ_8 0 I'M JANET SCIALES THE STAR GODDESS AND THAT'S BETTER LIVING THROUGH ASTROLOGY
GdoMqViy46A_1 0 SO ENDORPHINS AND RUNNING
GdoMqViy46A_2 0 ENDORPHINS ARE LIKE WHAT I WOULD CALL THE RUNNER'S HIGH I KNOW IN MY SPRINTS AND RUNNING MARATHONS I'VE RUN NEARLY THIRTY FIVE MARATHONS IN DIFFERENT TIMES
GdoMqViy46A_3 0 AND A FEW MARATHONS WHERE I'M RUNNING AND I FEEL LIKE LITERALLY FEET AREN'T TOUCHING THE GROUND
GdoMqViy46A_4 0 IT'S AS IF I'M SORT OF LIKE FLOATING AS I'M RUNNING
GdoMqViy46A_5 0 I'M VERY VERY FOCUSED I'M IN TUNED TO BOTH MY MENTAL SELF AND MY PHYSICAL SELF
GdoMqViy46A_6 0 I'VE HAD EXPERIENCE WHERE IT'S LIKE I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE THE OTHER RUNNERS AROUND ME
GdoMqViy46A_7 0 I DIDN'T HEAR THE CROWD OF FANS CHEERING US ON DURING THE MARATHON
GdoMqViy46A_8 0 A LOT OF MARATHONS HAVE BANDS OUT PLAYING LIVE MUSIC I'VE BEEN SO FOCUSED THAT IT'S AS IF I DIDN'T EVEN HEAR THE MUSIC
GdoMqViy46A_9 0 I FEEL LIKE AS IF I'M IN THIS SORT OF LIKE NARROW SORT OF LIKE MARATHON TUNNEL SO TO SPEAK
GdoMqViy46A_10 0 AND I'M ON SUCH A RUNNER'S HIGH AS I'M GOING THROUGH OR RUNNING THE MARATHON THAT I'M JUST TOTALLY FOCUSED ON GETTING TO THE FINISH LINE
GdoMqViy46A_11 0 AND FOR ME FROM MY EXPERIENCE I THINK ENDORPHINS HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH YOUR ABILITY TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING THAT IS AT LEAST FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IS PRETTY RARE BECAUSE YOU ARE AT SUCH MAXIMUM FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION THAT NOTHING AROUND YOU EVEN MATTERS
GdoMqViy46A_12 0 AND SO IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW EXPLAINING WHAT ENDORPHINS ARE THAT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE AT LEAST AS A RUNNER
GdoMqViy46A_13 0 I'VE ALSO HAD MY CLIENTS TELL ME THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED SOMETHING SIMILAR WHERE THEY MIGHT BE SO FOCUSED ON THEIR RACE AND MAYBE NOT EVEN IN THE RACE IT CAN BE EVEN WHEN YOU ARE DOING LIKE TRAINING OR SPEED WORK ON THE TRACK OR THEY ARE GOING OUT FOR A LONG TRAINING RUN AND THEY EXPERIENCE A RUNNER'S KIND OF HIGH
GdoMqViy46A_14 0 SO IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT ENDORPHINS ARE I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU REALLY JUST SORT OF HAVE TO EXPERIENCE FOR YOURSELF
h4duFFZNKjQ_1 0 IN THIS POSE GINA AND RISSA IS GOING TO HELP ME DEMONSTRATE THE PLANK POSE TO A DOWN DOG POSE
h4duFFZNKjQ_2 0 SO THEY'RE GOING TO COME BACK JUST A LITTLE BIT
h4duFFZNKjQ_3 0 GINA IS GOING TO COME ON DOWN INTO A TABLETOP POSITION
h4duFFZNKjQ_5 0 SO SHE'S GOING TO HAVE HER KNEES ABOUT HIP WIDTH DISTANCE APART AND SHE'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT HER WRISTS ARE DIRECTLY UNDER HER SHOULDERS
h4duFFZNKjQ_6 0 RISSA IS GOING TO COME ALONG SIDE HER YEAH AND TAKE HER KNEES EQUAL TO GINA'S KNEES HER HANDS AGAIN ARE ALSO GOING TO BE RIGHT UNDERNEATH HER SHOULDERS
h4duFFZNKjQ_7 0 THEN SHE'S GOING TO LIFT ONE LEG UP AT A TIME UP INTO GINA'S SHOULDERS
h4duFFZNKjQ_9 0 SO GINA IS ON TABLETOP OR CAT POSE AND RISSA IS DEMONSTRATING PLANK POSE
h4duFFZNKjQ_10 0 RISSA IS GOING TO PULL BELLY BUTTON IN
h4duFFZNKjQ_11 0 GOOD AND LENGTHENING OUT THROUGH THE CROWN OF HER
h4duFFZNKjQ_12 0 SO SHE'S ONE LONG LINE OF ENERGY FROM THE CROWN OF HER HEAD ALL THE WAY DOWN TO HER TOES
h4duFFZNKjQ_13 0 GINA IS GOING TO CURL HER TOES UNDER AND LIFT HER KNEES UP PRESS BACK AND LIFT UP INTO A DOWN DOG
h4duFFZNKjQ_16 0 AND THEN WHEN GINA'S READY SHE'S GOING TO PRESS HER KNEES BACK DOWN
h4duFFZNKjQ_18 0 AND ONE AT A TIME RISSA IS GOING TO TAKE HER KNEES DOWN
h4duFFZNKjQ_20 0 THAT'S THE PLANK POSE TO DOWN DOG
gkROs9DiR8U_1 0 HI MY NAME IS LUCY SPAIN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE HERE TO TALK ABOUT CHEER LEADING STUNTS
gkROs9DiR8U_2 0 NOW THAT YOU HAVE LEARNED YOUR GROUP STUNTS YOU CAN TAKE IT A LEVEL FURTHER AND CREATE PYRAMIDS
gkROs9DiR8U_3 0 PYRAMIDS ARE REALLY AWESOME WAY TO INCORPORATE THE WHOLE SQUAD INTO ONE STUNT WHICH IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE AND REALLY AWESOME
gkROs9DiR8U_4 0 IT CAN BE AS SIMPLE OR AS DIFFICULT AS YOU WANT IT
gkROs9DiR8U_5 0 HERE'S A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF PYRAMIDS
gkROs9DiR8U_6 0 THESE ARE GOING TO BE SOME OF THE MORE SIMPLISTIC PYRAMIDS
gkROs9DiR8U_7 0 THIS ONE RIGHT HERE A HEEL STRETCH PYRAMID IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST COMMON THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE ON ALMOST EVERY SQUAD OUT ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD
gkROs9DiR8U_8 0 NOW PYRAMIDS GENERALLY ARE GOING TO HAVE THREE LEVELS BUT THEY CAN HAVE TWO LEVELS
gkROs9DiR8U_9 0 BASICALLY IF YOU WANT TO DO A SIMPLE PYRAMID YOU'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE TWO NORMAL STUNTS SAY WE LEARNED THE GROUP HEEL STRETCH EARLIER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GIRL ON THE RIGHT SIDE DOING HER RIGHT HEEL STRETCH AND ONE STUNT GROUP OVER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER GIRL DOING HER LEFT HEEL STRETCH CO-JOINING IN THE MIDDLE
gkROs9DiR8U_10 0 IT IS REALLY NICE IF YOU CAN HAVE A GIRL IN THE MIDDLE THAT YOU CAN BOTH PUT YOUR ARMS ON SO EVERYONES TOUCHING IT CREATES A NICE PYRAMID
gv5-b4--WwY_1 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE THROWING THE VASE FROM THIS CENTERED PIECE OF CLAY
gv5-b4--WwY_2 0 SO THE FIRST STEP IS TO DAMPEN THE SPONGE
gv5-b4--WwY_3 0 FIND YOUR CENTER POINT AND SLOWLY ONCE AGAIN PUT SOME EVEN WEIGHT TO THE CENTER AND PULL OUT TOWARDS THE EDGE AT THE SAME TIME
gv5-b4--WwY_4 0 EVERYTHING IS SLOW MOTIONS
gv5-b4--WwY_5 0 ANYTHING THAT YOU MOVE OR THAT YOU DO REALLY FAST IS GOING TO UNCENTER THE CLAY AND NOT MAKE EVERYTHING EVEN
gv5-b4--WwY_6 0 SO NOW WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO THE VERY BOTTOM FOR THE FOOT OF THE VASE
gv5-b4--WwY_7 0 SO WE PUT SLOW PRESSURE INTO THE BOTTOM AND THEN PULL
gv5-b4--WwY_8 0 PULLING MY HANDS TOWARDS ME TO OPEN IT SO THAT IT'S LARGER
gv5-b4--WwY_9 0 WE'LL PULL IT AGAIN
gv5-b4--WwY_10 0 WE'LL ALSO PULL NOW SINCE WE REACHED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE VASE
gv5-b4--WwY_11 0 WE TAKE THIS OTHER HAND SQUEEZE THESE TWO HANDS TOGETHER AND SLOWLY PULL UP TO HEIGHTEN THE VASE
gv5-b4--WwY_12 0 AND THEN WE'LL KEEP PULLING
Gcr6I2sO5aM_2 0 THIS IS RISHABH JAIN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
Gcr6I2sO5aM_3 0 IN THIS CLIP I WILL TELL YOU HOW TO KNOW THE ENHANCEMENT OF A DIAMOND
Gcr6I2sO5aM_4 0 FIRSTLY I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST TO YOU NOT TO BUY A NON-CERTIFIED DIAMOND
Gcr6I2sO5aM_5 0 YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BUY A CERTIFIED DIAMOND WITH THE LASER INSCRIPTION ON IT
Gcr6I2sO5aM_6 0 LASER INSCRIPTION IS BASICALLY THE MARKING ON THE DIAMOND THAT SAYS THIS IS THE DIAMOND AND THIS IS THE CERTIFICATE OF THIS DIAMOND WITH A NUMBER ON IT
Gcr6I2sO5aM_7 0 STILL IF YOU WANT TO BUY A NON-CERTIFIED DIAMOND I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF ENHANCEMENTS
Gcr6I2sO5aM_8 0 ONE IS COLOR ENHANCEMENT AND THE OTHER ONE IS CLARITY ENHANCEMENT
Gcr6I2sO5aM_9 0 IN CLARITY ENHANCEMENT HERE LIKE YOU CAN SEE THESE FOUR DOTS
Gcr6I2sO5aM_10 0 BASICALLY CLARITY ENHANCEMENT IS DONE THROUGH LASER
Gcr6I2sO5aM_11 0 HERE YOU CAN SEE THE FOUR DOTS AND THIS IS THE TOP VIEW OF THE DIAMOND
Gcr6I2sO5aM_12 0 IF YOU GO TO THE SIDE VIEW OF THE DIAMOND YOU WILL FIND A VERY THIN LINE FROM THE SIDE COMING DOWN TOWARDS THE CULID
Gcr6I2sO5aM_13 0 AND FROM TOP IF YOU SEE YOU WILL FIND SMALL TINY DOTS
Gcr6I2sO5aM_14 0 SO THIS WAY YOU CAN KNOW ABOUT THE CLARITY OF A DIAMOND
Gcr6I2sO5aM_15 0 THE CLARITY ENHANCEMENT OF A DIAMOND
Gcr6I2sO5aM_16 0 THE WE COME TO THE COLOR ENHANCEMENT
Gcr6I2sO5aM_17 0 COLOR ENHANCEMENT IS DONE BASICALLY THROUGH TWO PROCEDURES
Gcr6I2sO5aM_18 0 ONE IS COATING
Gcr6I2sO5aM_19 0 AND THE OTHER ONE IS LASER
Gcr6I2sO5aM_20 0 IN COATING YOU CAN KNOW THE COLOR OF A DIAMOND BY JUST SCRATCHING WITH YOUR NAILS
Gcr6I2sO5aM_21 0 YOU CAN SCRATCH WITH THE NAILS AND IF IT IS A COATED DIAMOND THE COATING WILL COME OUT
Gcr6I2sO5aM_22 0 THE 2ND METHOD OF ENHANCING A DIAMOND IS THE LASER
Gcr6I2sO5aM_23 0 IF IT IS A LASER ENHANCEMENT THEN IT IS TOUGH FOR YOU TO RECOGNIZE
Gcr6I2sO5aM_24 0 SO I WOULD PREFER YOU TO BUY A CERTIFIED DIAMOND WHICH WILL TELL YOU IF IT IS ENHANCED OR NOT
GOZYCpC9W-M_1 0 HI MY NAME IS ELIZABETH
GOZYCpC9W-M_2 0 I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY DON'T WANT TO DO WITH YOUR SUGAR GLIDER
GOZYCpC9W-M_3 0 YOU DON'T EVER WANT TO TAKE YOUR SUGAR GLIDER OUTSIDE I DON'T CARE HOW WELL BONDED YOU THINK YOUR ANIMAL IS TO YOU IT JUST TAKES ON QUICK PREDATOR DOG TO JUMP UP AND SNATCH IT
GOZYCpC9W-M_4 0 OR FOR THEM TO GET INTO A TREE AND BE ABLE TO MOVE WAY FASTER THAN YOU CAN CATCH THESE GUYS
GOZYCpC9W-M_5 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO USE ANY SORT OF LEASH ON YOUR SUGAR GLIDER I HAVE SEEN THEM SOLD AT DIFFERENT PLACES
GOZYCpC9W-M_6 0 THE PROBLEM WITH THESE GUYS IS THAT THEY HAVE A VERY DELICATE MEMBRANE RIGHT AROUND THEIR SKIN UNDERNEATH THEIR ARMS AND IF YOU TRY TO PUT A LEASH ON THEM YOU CAN CUT INTO THAT TISSUE
GOZYCpC9W-M_7 0 ALSO IT CAN CUT INTO THE TISSUE AROUND THEIR NECK THEY JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF RESTRAINT
GOZYCpC9W-M_8 0 LEASHES ARE JUST NOT SAFE FOR THEM YOU NEED TO INSTEAD HAVE A CONFINED SAFE PLACE TO KEEP THESE ANIMALS IN
GOZYCpC9W-M_9 0 THE OTHER THINGS YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO WITH THESE GUYS YOU DON'T WANT TO FEED THEM ANY CHOCOLATE ALCOHOL OR ANY CAFFEINE
GOZYCpC9W-M_10 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO STAY AWAY FROM PURELY SUGARY UNHEALTHY FOOD LIKE CHEETOS OR CHEESE CANDY AND ANY OTHER SORT OF REFINED SUGARS
GOZYCpC9W-M_11 0 YOU WANT TO STICK TO THE BASIC DIET BECAUSE IF YOU THROW OFF THE BALANCE TOO MUCH IT CAN MAKE THEM VERY SICK

gthuH54_BoM_1 0 AND I HAVE CHOSEN THE WORD QUESTION FOR OUR Q WORD
gthuH54_BoM_2 0 AND OKAY I RAN OUT OF SPACE AND SO I PUT THE I INSIDE THE O AND I'M SURE THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER THIS RIDICULOUS
gthuH54_BoM_3 0 BUT GUESS WHAT IN THE OLD MANUSCRIPTS YOU KNOW NO BODY WAS SITTING AT A COMPUTER BACK IN THE 1200'S OR THE 113 A.D NO ONE WAS SITTING AT A COMPUTER
gthuH54_BoM_4 0 AND IF THEY HAD A SPACIAL PROBLEM THERE WERE ALL KINDS OF INVENTIVE THINGS THAT THEY COULD DO
gthuH54_BoM_5 0 AS LONG AS THIS WORD READS AS THE WORD QUESTION YOU WE'RE FINE
gthuH54_BoM_6 0 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT QUESTION AUTHORITY THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO SAY
gthuH54_BoM_7 0 I BET THAT IS AN IDEA THAT CAME UP TO YOU WHEN YOU SAW THIS WORD QUESTION
gthuH54_BoM_8 0 I WOULD SAY LET US QUESTION THE AUTHORITY OF ANY PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT SHOW AN ALPHABET OVER THE BLACK BOARD THAT FOLLOWS ALONG WITH THESE PRINCIPLES BECAUSE IT'S ONLY WITH THESE PRINCIPLES THAT WHAT YOU HAVE IS A HOLISTIC FORM
gthuH54_BoM_9 0 OTHERWISE WHAT YOU HAVE IS A SET OF DESPERATE SHAPES THAT DON'T EVEN RELATE TO EACH OTHER SO THERE'S NO WAY TO TEACH ANY OF THE PRINCIPLES AND THERE'S NO WAY TO TEACH MUCH OF ANYTHING
gthuH54_BoM_10 0 SO QUESTION AUTHORITY
gyZcJmzkSIw_1 0 STEPHEN KOEPFER ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS STEPHEN KOEPFER OF NEW YORK COMBAT SAMBO IN NEW YORK CITY AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU SAMBO COMBINATIONS
gyZcJmzkSIw_2 0 OKAY IN THIS SAMBO COMBINATION AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH A KNEE STRIKE BUT INSTEAD OF DOING A SACRIFICE THROW WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO A FOOT SWEEP
gyZcJmzkSIw_3 0 AGAIN I HAVE MY GRIP
gyZcJmzkSIw_4 0 IT CAN REALLY BE ANY GRIP
gyZcJmzkSIw_5 0 THE GRIP IS LESS IMPORTANT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE GOOD CONTROL OVER YOUR OPPONENT'S SHOULDERS
gyZcJmzkSIw_6 0 SO I'M WORKING MY KNEE STRIKES KNEE STRIKES

Ge9UMjIPT1Y_2 0 I'M JOE CUENCO WITH FAMILY RESOURCES
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_3 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE IMPROVE OUR RELATIONSHIP SKILLS
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_4 0 SPECIFICALLY HOW TO BE STRONG FOR HER
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_5 0 JUST WHAT DO WE MEAN BY HOW TO BE STRONG FOR HER
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_6 0 YOU CAN TAKE IT TWO WAYS
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_7 0 THE PHYSICAL ASPECT COULD BE HOW DO YOU CARRY YOUR WIFE OR YOUR PARTNER UPSTAIRS TO THE BEDROOM
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_8 0 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHICH MAY LEAD TO THAT
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_9 0 BUT IT'S REALLY THE EMOTIONAL OR THE SPIRITUAL SIDE
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_10 0 HOW DO YOU BECOME STRONG FOR AN INDIVIDUAL EMOTIONALLY OR SPIRITUALLY
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_11 0 IT'S REALLY KIND OF A CHARACTER BASED THING FOR THE HUSBAND OR FOR THE MAN
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_12 0 THE MAN NEEDS TO BE A PERSON OF INNER STRENGTH FIRST OF ALL
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_13 0 BEFORE YOU CAN BE STRONG FOR SOMEBODY ELSE YOU HAVE SOME INNER CONFIDENCE
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_14 0 YOU HAVE TO YOUR HEAD ON STRAIGHT
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_15 0 YOU NEED TO HAVE YOUR THOUGHTS ALIGNED
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_16 0 YOU NEED TO BE A PERSON OF CHARACTER
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_17 0 ANOTHER THING THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO EMPATHETIC TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION AND UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR WIFE PARTNER OR GIRLFRIEND IS GOING THROUGH
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_18 0 PERHAPS IT'S A SITUATION WHERE SHE'S GOING THROUGH AN ILLNESS
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_19 0 PERHAPS SHE WAS LAID OFF FROM HER JOB OR GOING THROUGH SOME DIFFICULTIES WITH HER FAMILY
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_20 0 YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION PROVIDE A LISTENING EAR THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_21 0 BE EMPATHETIC SO THAT YOU CAN APPRECIATE WHAT SHE'S GOING THROUGH AT THAT TIME
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_22 0 BE THERE TO SUPPORT HER
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_23 0 MAYBE HELP HER OUT
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_24 0 MAYBE THERE'S TASKS THAT YOU CAN HELP HER OUT TO TAKE THINGS OFF OF HER PLATE
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_25 0 OTHER THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO WOULD BE BE THERE PHYSICALLY FOR HER
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_26 0 MAYBE IT'S HOLDING HER HAND TELLING HER THAT YOU DO LOVE HER YOU SUPPORT HER AND THAT YOU WOULD BE THERE FOR HER
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_27 0 THESE ARE ALL VERY IMPORTANT THINGS
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_28 0 AT TIMES YOU WILL NEED TO DEMONSTRATE AN IN CHARGE ATTITUDE
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_29 0 MEANING THAT BASICALLY YOU MAY HAVE TO TAKE CONTROL OF CERTAIN SITUATIONS
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_30 0 BE PREPARED TO DO THAT
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_31 0 REMEMBER THERE'S THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF THINGS
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_32 0 THERE'S EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL SIDE
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_33 0 YOU NEED TO BE A GIVING PERSON
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_34 0 THE HALLMARK OF A STRONG MAN IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO GIVE AND BE EMPATHETIC
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_35 0 YOU NEED TO APPRECIATE WHAT THAT PERSON IS GOING THROUGH
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_36 0 ONCE SHE HAS GONE THROUGH THAT SITUATION IT'S A MATTER OF GOING BACK TO LIFE HOPEFULLY AS USUAL
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_37 0 THEN YOU COULD WORK ON BUILDING THAT RELATIONSHIP
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_38 0 YOU CAN TRUST THAT THAT RELATIONSHIP WILL BE MUCH STRONGER IF YOU SUPPORTED AND PROVIDED THE RIGHT LEVEL OF SUPPORT
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_39 0 THAT'S HOW WE CAN BE STRONG FOR HER
Ge9UMjIPT1Y_40 0 I'M JOE CUENCO WITH END RESOURCES- RELATIONSHIPS FOR LIFE
Hk5WNr-RFE8_1 0 HI I'M MIKE PAYNE OWNER OF THE ACADEMY FOR MARTIAL ARTS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE ON THE TOPIC OF WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOL
Hk5WNr-RFE8_2 0 I WOULD AVOID SCHOOLS WHERE THE CLASSES ARE TOO CROWDED
Hk5WNr-RFE8_3 0 YOU'VE GOT THE STUDENT/TEACHER RATIO IS VERY HIGH
Hk5WNr-RFE8_4 0 THEY DON'T HAVE A FLOOR WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE SAFE IF THEY FALL DOWN
Hk5WNr-RFE8_5 0 KEEP THAT INTENSITY UP
Hk5WNr-RFE8_6 0 KEEP THAT FOCUS UP
Hk5WNr-RFE8_7 0 KEEP PAYING ATTENTION
Hk5WNr-RFE8_8 0 KEEP STRIVING TO DO YOUR ABSOLUTE BEST ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE TIME
Hk5WNr-RFE8_9 0 IF YOU'VE GOT VERY YOUNG INSTRUCTORS IF YOU'VE GOT INSTRUCTORS YOU'VE GOT TEENAGE STUDENTS OR MAYBE LET'S SAY A GREEN BELT LEADING THE CLASS I WOULD DEFINITELY AVOID THAT
Hk5WNr-RFE8_10 0 I MEAN WE WORK HARD IN THAT
Hk5WNr-RFE8_11 0 BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE SCHOOLS LIKE THAT ONE THEY DO THE AFTER SCHOOL THEY GET LIKE FIFTY OR SIXTY SEVENTY KIDS IN ONE CLASS
Hk5WNr-RFE8_12 0 THEY HAVE WHOMEVER THEY CAN GET TO HELP TEACH
hF48m-fxAGo_1 0 SO THE FIRST STEP THROWING ON THE WHEEL IS TO CENTER THE CLAY
hF48m-fxAGo_2 0 FIRST YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR BALL OF CLAY AND YOU WANT IT TO BE AS ROUND AS POSSIBLE THAT MAKES CENTERING MUCH EASIER AND THROW IT DOWN PRETTY HARD RIGHT ON THE CENTER OF THE WHEEL
hF48m-fxAGo_3 0 AND THEN YOU NEED TO HAVE A BUCKET WATER AND A SPONGE AND FOR ME THE WAY THAT I CENTER IS I LEAN ON THE SPLASH-PAN WITH MY LEFT ARM AND KEEPS MY LEFT ARM FROM MOVING
hF48m-fxAGo_4 0 I PUT ALL MY BODY WEIGHT INTO THAT AND I TRY TO TRANSFER IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE HEEL OF MY LEFT HAND
hF48m-fxAGo_5 0 THIS HAND IS NOT GOING TO BE MOVING AND IT'S MY RIGHT HAND THAT'S GOING TO BE DOING THE WORK
hF48m-fxAGo_6 0 SO I'LL GET THE SPONGE WET ENOUGH THAT IF I SQUEEZE IT WATER COMES OUT BUT IT'S NOT DRIPPING
hF48m-fxAGo_7 0 AND I'LL SQUEEZE IT A LITTLE BIT SO THAT I CAN GET THIS BALL MOIST AND THEN I'LL TAKE MY RIGHT HAND AND PUSH TOWARDS MY LEFT HAND AND UP AND THEN DOWN USING THE HEEL OF MY LEFT HAND TO KEEP THAT CLAY FROM PUSHING OUT VERY FAR
hF48m-fxAGo_8 0 AND ONCE IT LOOKS AND FEELS LIKE IT'S NO LONGER MOVING YOU'VE GOT A CENTERED LIMP OF CLAY
Hfg1NJxVHog_2 0 WELCOME TO EXPERT VILLAGE
Hfg1NJxVHog_3 0 MY NAME IS WAYNE PETERSON AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE IMPORTANT BIRD AREAS PROGRAM FOR THE MASSACHUSETTS AUDUBON SOCIETY
Hfg1NJxVHog_4 0 TODAY WE'RE HERE AT THE DANIEL WEBSTER WILDLIFE SANCTUARY IN MARSHFIELD MASSACHUSETTS WHERE WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT BIRD IDENTIFICATION AND SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT AND ESSENTIAL TOOLS THAT ARE USEFUL TO GET ONE STARTED IN THIS INCREDIBLY INTERESTING PASTIME
Hfg1NJxVHog_5 0 ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT BIRD IDENTIFICATION IS TO REMEMBER WHERE YOU'RE BIRDING
Hfg1NJxVHog_6 0 WHAT'S THE HABITAT SPECIFICALLY IN THE LOCATION WHERE YOU'RE SPENDING TIME
Hfg1NJxVHog_7 0 FORESTS AND WOODLANDS ARE CERTAINLY ONE OF OUR MORE FAMILIAR HABITATS AND ACROSS NORTH AMERICA REPRESENT ONE OF THE MAJOR ECOSYSTEM TYPES
Hfg1NJxVHog_8 0 ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF BIRDING IN FORESTS IS THE FACT THAT THERE IS A LOT OF FOLIAGE AND UNDERCOVER THAT CAN MAKE OBSERVING BIRDS MORE DIFFICULT
Hfg1NJxVHog_9 0 AND THE FACT THAT IN MANY CASES BIRDS ARE OVER YOUR HEAD
Hfg1NJxVHog_10 0 YOU MAY HAVE TO BE LOOKING UP
Hfg1NJxVHog_11 0 AND YOU MAY HAVE THE PROBLEM OF BACK LIGHTING AND SO FORTH MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT IN MANY CASES TO SEE THE BIRDS
Hfg1NJxVHog_12 0 SO BIRD VOCALIZATIONS AND SOUNDS LIKE WE DISCUSSED EARLIER CAN BE VERY USEFUL
Hfg1NJxVHog_13 0 BUT SOME OF THE BIRDS THAT ARE QUITE TYPICAL OF FORESTED SITUATIONS INCLUDE FIRST OF ALL CANOPY SPECIES BIRDS THAT LIKE TO SPEND THEIR TIME HIGH IN THE TREES
Hfg1NJxVHog_14 0 THESE WOULD BE THINGS LIKE ROSE BREASTED GROSBEAKS SCARLET TANAGERS RED-EYED VIREOS FOR EXAMPLE LOTS OF THE WARBLERS
Hfg1NJxVHog_15 0 THEN THERE ARE SPECIES THAT SORT OF OCCUR AT MID-STORY
Hfg1NJxVHog_16 0 WE MENTIONED THE WOOD THRUSH EARLIER AS BEING A SPECIES THAT OFTEN LIKES TO SING SORT OF MID-STORY IN THE FOREST CANOPY SITUATION
Hfg1NJxVHog_17 0 SOME OF THE FLY CATCHERS ARE OFTEN FOUND AT MID-LEVEL RATHER THAN HIGH IN THE TREES
Hfg1NJxVHog_18 0 AND THEN THERE ARE BIRDS THAT ACTUALLY OCCUR DOWN ON THE FOREST FLOOR OR IN THE UNDERGROWTH
Hfg1NJxVHog_19 0 A WARBLER FOR EXAMPLE LIKE THE OVEN BIRD THAT NESTS ON THE GROUND WOULD BE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A SPECIES THAT THAT WOULD BE A TYPICAL SORT OF A FOREST FLOOR DWELLER
Hfg1NJxVHog_20 0 SO WHEN BIRDING IN THESE HABITATS IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE WATCHING FOR MOVEMENT AT ALL LEVELS TO MOVE QUIETLY TO WEAR CLOTHING THAT IS RELATIVELY UNOBTRUSIVE SO YOU WON'T STARTLE THE BIRDS AND TO BE PARTICULARLY VIGILANT FOR SOUNDS THAT WILL PERHAPS LEAD YOU TO THE BIRD OR IN SOME CASES IF YOU RECOGNIZE THE VOCALIZATION WILL ACTUALLY TELL YOU WHAT IT IS
Hfg1NJxVHog_21 0 BUT THESE CAN BE VERY RICH AND PRODUCTIVE HABITATS AT ALMOST ALL TIMES OF THE YEAR
Hfg1NJxVHog_22 0 BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY BEST AND MOST EASILY BIRDED SOMETIME IN MID SPRING TO EARLY SUMMER WHEN THERE IS LIKELY TO BE A LOT OF BIRD ACTIVITY AND SPECIFICALLY SONG THAT WILL LEAD YOU TO WHERE BIRDS MAY BE
GuBHuLTwVwE_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS NICOLE VALENTINE AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO COORDINATE BIRTHDAY GAMES FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY
GuBHuLTwVwE_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO NOW TALK ABOUT HOW TO PLAY THE GAME THINK FAST
GuBHuLTwVwE_3 0 THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE GAME
GuBHuLTwVwE_4 0 JUST USE A BALL THAT YOU HAVE AT HOME GO TO YOUR KIDS ROOM GO TO THE TOY BOX AND CHOOSE AN EASY BALL AND YOU WOULD LIKE TO LINE THE GUEST OF THE PARTY IN A CIRCLE
GuBHuLTwVwE_5 0 CHOOSE A THEME
GuBHuLTwVwE_6 0 IF IT'S A BOY'S PARTY YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO WITH POWER RANGERS OR SPORTS JUST DEPENDING ON HOW OLD THEY ARE
GuBHuLTwVwE_7 0 SO ONCE THE THEME IS CHOSEN FOR EACH ROUND OF THE GAME YOU'RE GOING TO START THE FIRST ROUND
GuBHuLTwVwE_8 0 LET'S SAY THE THEME IS SPORTS
GuBHuLTwVwE_9 0 SO YOU CHOOSE SOMEONE TO START THE GAME OFF
GuBHuLTwVwE_10 0 THAT PERSON WOULD HAVE TO FIRST CALL OUT A SPORT NAME
GuBHuLTwVwE_12 0 TOSS THE BALL
GuBHuLTwVwE_13 0 WHOEVER CATCHES IT WITHIN THREE SECONDS WILL HAVE TO SAY ANOTHER SPORT GAME
GuBHuLTwVwE_15 0 THEY THEN WILL TOSS THE BALL TO SOMEONE ELSE IN THE CIRCLE AND THEY HAVE THREE SECONDS TO COME UP WITH ANOTHER SPORT NAME
GuBHuLTwVwE_17 0 THE GAME CONTINUES TO GO ON UNTIL THE LAST PERSON IS STANDING
GuBHuLTwVwE_18 0 ONCE THE PERSON DOES NOT THINK OF A SPORT GAME THEY ARE OUT
GuBHuLTwVwE_19 0 THIS IS A FUN GAME AND YOU'RE ABLE TO GATHER EVERYONE BACK IN TO CHOOSE A NEW THEME
GuBHuLTwVwE_20 0 FOOD CANDY TV SHOWS WHATEVER IT IS JUST BE CREATIVE

hCQj7s7wJsk_10 0 SO THE BOTTOMS ARE COOKED A LITTLE BIT LONGER THE TOPS WILL GO IN AT THE END

ghI5ayeMEhw_8 0 BUT WE'RE NOT GOING BACKWARDS WE'RE GOING INWARDS
ghI5ayeMEhw_10 0 INWARD IS THIS
ghI5ayeMEhw_11 0 WE'RE ACTUALLY JUMPING BACK BUT ROTATING INWARD TOWARD THE BOARD
ghI5ayeMEhw_12 0 IT'S PRETTY CLEVER RIGHT
ghI5ayeMEhw_13 0 SO I START WITH MY BACK TO THE WATER I'M JUMPING BACK BUT I'M ROTATING INTO THE BOARD

ghI5ayeMEhw_22 0 SO WE'RE DOING THE INWARD GROUP TODAY TWO DIVES INWARD DIVE PIKE AND INWARD ONE-AND-A-HALF
HDf07ZoVpoQ_2 0 DECORATING YOUR OWN APPAREL CAN BE FUN AND IT CAN ADD A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR OWN LITTLE DISTINCT PERSONALITY TO WHAT YOU HAVE
HDf07ZoVpoQ_3 0 THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO DOING THIS AND ONE IS HOW TO SEW ON A PATCH
HDf07ZoVpoQ_4 0 MY NAME IS DANIEL KING
HDf07ZoVpoQ_5 0 I'M A DESIGNER AND PATTERN MAKER
HDf07ZoVpoQ_6 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SEWING ON PATCHES
HDf07ZoVpoQ_7 0 YOU CAN BUY PATCHES AT YOUR FAVORITE FABRIC OR CRAFT SHOP
HDf07ZoVpoQ_8 0 YOU CAN PURCHASE THESE PATCHES
HDf07ZoVpoQ_9 0 THEY USUALLY WILL HAVE A FINISHED EDGE TO THEM AND YOU JUST WHIP STITCH AROUND IT
HDf07ZoVpoQ_10 0 OR YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE YOUR OWN PATCHES
HDf07ZoVpoQ_11 0 YOU MAY FIND ANOTHER CONTRASTING FABRIC OR A SIMILAR FABRIC TO PUT ON TOP OF LET'S SAY YOUR JEANS EVEN PILLOWCASES AND DECORATIVE ITEMS AROUND YOUR HOUSE
HDf07ZoVpoQ_12 0 TO DO THIS YOU CUT OUT THE PAT THE PIECE OF FABRIC THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE THE PATCH OR AGAIN YOU CAN USE THE PRE-MADE PATCH THAT YOU BUY AT THE STORE
HDf07ZoVpoQ_13 0 YOU HAVE A ROUGH EDGE TO IT
HDf07ZoVpoQ_14 0 NOW SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIKE TO HAVE THAT LITTLE FRAYED LOOK SO YOU CAN JUST START WITH THAT OR YOU CAN TAKE IT UNDER AND USE AN IRON AND PRESS IT SO YOU HAVE A VERY SMOOTH EDGE TO THAT PIECE OF PATCH
HDf07ZoVpoQ_15 0 PLACE THAT ON TOP OF THE GARMENT OR THE PILLOW IN THIS CASE AND I'M GOING TO JUST TAKE AND WHIP STITCH
HDf07ZoVpoQ_16 0 I WANT TO GO GRAB A LITTLE BIT OF THE UNDER FABRIC PULL THE NEEDLE THROUGH THE PATCH PULL IT OUT THERE AND JUST PUSH UNDERNEATH AND PUSH UP AND OVER
HDf07ZoVpoQ_17 0 UNDERNEATH UP AND OVER
HDf07ZoVpoQ_18 0 AND YOU CAN PUT THIS PATCH ANYWHERE YOU LIKE
HDf07ZoVpoQ_19 0 MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE RIP MAYBE IT'S A TEAR OR MAYBE IT'S JUST FOR DECORATION BUT THAT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MAKING YOUR OWN DISTINCTIVE DESIGNS USING PATCHES
HDf07ZoVpoQ_20 0 MY NAME IS DANIEL KING
gDx4dELC820_1 0 THE MARINE ORGANISM WE'RE GOING TO IDENTIFY NOW IS THE SLENDER FILEFISH
gDx4dELC820_2 0 THE SLENDER FILEFISH IS ONE OF THE SMALLER OF THE FILEFISH SPECIES
gDx4dELC820_3 0 THEY RANGE IN SIZE FROM TWO TO THREE AND A HALF INCHES IN LENGTH
gDx4dELC820_4 0 THEY HAVE A SLENDER ELONGATED HEAD WITH A VERY SMALL MOUTH
gDx4dELC820_5 0 AS WITH ALL FILEFISH THE FIRST SPINE OF THE DORSAL FIN IS MUCH LONGER THAN THE OTHERS AND CAN BE USED WHEN EXTENDED TO LOCK THE FISH INTO A SMALL NOOK IN THE REEF SO THAT THEY CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO REMOVE
gDx4dELC820_6 0 SLENDER FILEFISH ARE GENERALLY A SHADE OF BROWN EITHER A REDDISH OR A YELLOWISH BROWN TO GRAY ON THE TOP PART OF THEIR BODY AND THEN A LIGHTER COLOR ON THE BOTTOM HALF
gDx4dELC820_7 0 THEY ALSO FREQUENTLY HAVE RETICULATED MARKINGS OVER THEIR BODY BUT THOSE MARKING MAY NOT ALWAYS BE OBVIOUS
gDx4dELC820_8 0 IN FACT SLENDER FILEFISH CAN DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THEIR COLORS TO BETTER BLEND IN WITH THEIR BACKGROUND
gDx4dELC820_9 0 SLENDER FILEFISH ALSO HAVE A LARGE EXTENDABLE BELLY APPENDAGE CALLED THE DEW LAP THAT USUALLY HAS A YELLOW BORDER ON THE TRAILING EDGE
gDx4dELC820_10 0 SLENDER FILEFISH ARE GENERALLY FOUND HIDING IN THE BRANCHES OF GARGONIANS
gDx4dELC820_11 0 THEY ARE QUITE SHY AND WILL SLOWLY MOVE EITHER DEEPER INTO THE GARGONIAN WHEN APPROACHED BY DIVERS OR WILL MOVE SLOWLY AROUND THE BACKSIDE OF THE GARGONIAN BRANCH TO HIDE FROM THE OBSERVER
gDx4dELC820_12 0 SLENDER FILEFISH FEED ON ALGAE AND INVERTEBRATES
gDx4dELC820_13 0 THEY ARE RELATIVELY UNCOMMONLY FOUND IN THE WATERS AROUND FLORIDA THE BAHAMAS AND THE CARIBBEAN
gDx4dELC820_14 0 THEY CAN BE FOUND IN DEPTHS FROM TEN TO SIXTY FEET AND ARE GENERALLY FOUND AS SOLITARY ANIMALS
gDx4dELC820_15 0 THAT'S THE SLENDER FILEFISH
gui9Jmr4hSU_1 0 SO NOW YOU'VE GOT A BUNCH OF BROKEN TILES WHAT DO YOU DO NEXT
gui9Jmr4hSU_2 0 IT'S TIME TO START POSITIONING THEM ONTO YOUR SUB STRAIGHT
gui9Jmr4hSU_3 0 THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS TO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE POSITIONING TILES
gui9Jmr4hSU_4 0 IF YOU HAVE A SHAPE OR A CENTRAL FEATURE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ACCENT YOU NEED TO DO THAT SHAPE FIRST
gui9Jmr4hSU_5 0 FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE A HEART IN THE MIDDLE OR A SUN YOU WANT TO START WITH THAT SHAPE AND TILE THAT WHOLE SHAPE AND THEN TILE THE BACKGROUND
gui9Jmr4hSU_6 0 IT JUST MAKES IT EASIER THAT WAY
gui9Jmr4hSU_7 0 ONE THING I'M DOING IS BECAUSE OF THE TILES I'VE CHOSEN I'VE DECIDED THIS WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD RANDOM PATTERN
gui9Jmr4hSU_8 0 SO I'M GOING TO PUT DOWN A FEW PIECES IN A RANDOM THEME AND TELL YOU WHAT I CONSIDER WHEN I PLACE MY TILES
gui9Jmr4hSU_9 0 FIRST OF ALL YOU DON'T WANT TO POSITION ALL OF YOUR TILES BEFORE STARTING TO GLUE THEM BECAUSE ONCE YOU START GLUING THEY'LL MOVE JUST A LITTLE BIT AND THEN ITS NOT GOING TO FIT ANYMORE
gui9Jmr4hSU_10 0 SO YOU WANT TO JUST POSITION A FEW AT A TIME AND THEN GLUE THEM DOWN
gui9Jmr4hSU_11 0 THINGS I THINK ABOUT WHEN I POSITION MY TILES IS STARTING WITH CORNERS
gui9Jmr4hSU_12 0 ITS NICE TO PUT A CORNER IN A CORNER THAT WAY YOU GET A VERY NICE CLEAN EDGE
gui9Jmr4hSU_13 0 OTHER THINGS I THINK ABOUT ARE SHAPE AND COLOR
gui9Jmr4hSU_14 0 I HAVE ONE PATTERN HERE ANOTHER PATTERN HERE MAYBE I NEED A SOLID COLOR HERE
gui9Jmr4hSU_15 0 YOU CAN ALSO THINK ABOUT GROUT LINES
gui9Jmr4hSU_16 0 I REALLY LIKE HAVING UNIFORM GROUT LINES WHICH MEANS A QUARTER OF AN INCH OF GROUT BETWEEN EVERY SINGLE PIECE
gui9Jmr4hSU_17 0 SOME PEOPLE DON'T CARE THOUGH THEY HAVE BIGGER GROUT LINES AND SMALLER GROUT LINES YOU CAN MAKE UP YOUR MIND WHAT LOOKS BEST FOR YOU
gui9Jmr4hSU_18 0 ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER IS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST PLACE PIECES ANYWHERE AND THEN TRY AND FILL IN THE EMPTY SPACES
gui9Jmr4hSU_19 0 BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS YOU'RE GOING TO PLACE YOURSELF INTO A CORNER WHERE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO FIT ANY PIECE IN SOME WEIRD OR AWKWARD SPACE
gui9Jmr4hSU_20 0 ALTHOUGH IF THAT HAPPENS YOU CAN ALWAYS GO BACK TO YOUR NIPPERS AND NIP A LITTLE PIECE THAT'LL FIT RIGHT IN THE SPACE AS NEEDED
heHbgPxMsKQ_1 0 THE FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY BEFORE WE GET TOO DEEP INTO DIET AND CARE AND THINGS LIKE THAT FOR THE CENTIPEDE IS WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS HOW TO MAKE A GOOD ENCLOSURE FOR THE CENTIPEDE
heHbgPxMsKQ_2 0 ONE THAT IS ESPECIALLY ESCAPE PROOF
heHbgPxMsKQ_3 0 THAT'S REALLY ONE OF OUR MAIN CONCERNS HERE IS CREATING A ENCLOSURE THAT HE CAN'T GET OUT OF
heHbgPxMsKQ_4 0 SO PERSONALLY WHAT I LIKE TO USE IS I LIKE TO USE JARS OF SOME TYPE OR ANOTHER
heHbgPxMsKQ_5 0 I LIKE THE GLASS ONES PREFERABLY
heHbgPxMsKQ_6 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE THE PLASTIC ONES WITH LIKE A SNAP LID
heHbgPxMsKQ_7 0 WHATEVER IT IS IT NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING THAT HAS A VERY SECURE LID
heHbgPxMsKQ_8 0 THE REASONS I LIKE THESE TYPES OF JARS IS BECAUSE IT IS A SCREW TOP LID IT'S NOT GOING TO COME OFF ON ACCIDENT
heHbgPxMsKQ_9 0 ONCE IT'S ON IT'S ON
heHbgPxMsKQ_10 0 SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANY SORT OF MISTAKES
heHbgPxMsKQ_11 0 SO THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING YOU WANT TO AVOID
heHbgPxMsKQ_12 0 YOU CAN BUY THIS IN ANY YOU KNOW SUPERMARKET OR PROBABLY ANY CRAFT STORE AS WELL
heHbgPxMsKQ_13 0 BASICALLY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A LARGE MASON JAR LIKE OBJECT OF SOME SORT
heHbgPxMsKQ_14 0 SOME PEOPLE USE TUPPERWARE THINGS LIKE THAT I LIKE TO STAY AWAY FROM THE PLASTIC
heHbgPxMsKQ_15 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH THAT
heHbgPxMsKQ_16 0 WE'RE GOING TO START OFF WITH AND THIS GUY SHOULDN'T RUN YOU ANY MORE THAN FIVE OR SIX BUCKS
heHbgPxMsKQ_17 0 BUT OF COURSE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT USEFUL FOR US THERE IS GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF MODIFICATION TO GET IT WHERE WE NEED IT TO BE
heHbgPxMsKQ_18 0 NOT A WHOLE LOT BUT JUST A LITTLE BIT AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT IN NEXT TUNE
GgHxdyX3sqI_1 0 SO ALTHOUGH I DON'T LIKE GLOPPY OR OVERLY THICK CLAM OR FISH CHOWDER YOU HAVE TO THICKEN IT A LITTLE BIT
GgHxdyX3sqI_2 0 WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS JUST REGULAR OLD ALL PURPOSE FLOUR
GgHxdyX3sqI_3 0 I WOULDN'T USE WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR OR BLEACHED UNBLEACHED BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T MAKE THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE SO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS SPRINKLE THIS INTO THE ONIONS AND WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE THAT BACON FAT AND THIS FLOUR COOK
GgHxdyX3sqI_4 0 I'M GOING TO THREE 1/2 ALMOST FOUR TABLESPOONS OF FLOUR AND NOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS SIMPLY TO JUST COOK IT
GgHxdyX3sqI_5 0 I MAY TURN THE HEAT DOWN A LITTLE BIT
GgHxdyX3sqI_6 0 THE THING ABOUT FLOUR IS IF YOU DON'T COOK IT IT TENDS TO HAVE A PASTY FEEL TO IT
GgHxdyX3sqI_7 0 SO IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO COOK IT AND IF YOU WERE USING BUTTER WHEN YOU WERE MAKING A ROUX YOU WOULD WANT IT TO SMELL A BIT LIKE SHORTBREAD COOKIES AND THAT IS HOW YOU KNOW WHEN THE FLOUR IS DONE
GgHxdyX3sqI_8 0 BUT IN THIS CASE BECAUSE WE GOT THAT BACON FAT IN THERE WE ARE REALLY JUST GOING TO COOK IT FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES AND KEEP STIRRING IT AND I DON'T WON'T TO BURN IT AT ALL OR HAVE IT TAKE ANY COLOR BECAUSE I'VE GOTTEN A LITTLE BIT OF COLOR FROM OUR BACON TO BEGIN WITH AND I LIKE MY COLOR TO BE AS WHITE AS IT CAN BE
GgHxdyX3sqI_9 0 BUT WE ARE REALLY JUST GOING TO COOK THE FLOUR A LITTLE TO TAKE AWAY THAT PASTINESS
GgHxdyX3sqI_10 0 OKAY SO WHILE THAT IS COOKING I WANT TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE NEXT PART OF THE LIQUID
GgHxdyX3sqI_11 0 OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE CREAM AND IN THIS CASE WE ARE GOING TO USE MILK BECAUSE I LIKE IT TO BE A LITTLE BIT THINNER
GgHxdyX3sqI_12 0 THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT LIQUIDS YOU CAN USE
GgHxdyX3sqI_13 0 IF YOU NOT ALLERGIC TO SHELL FISH I WOULD SAY ABSOLUTELY USE CLAM JUICE AND CLAM JUICE IS QUITE INEXPENSIVE AND IT IS EASY TO FIND AND IT IS IN AND AROUND THE TUNA FISH AND THAT KIND OF THING IN YOUR SUPERMARKET AND ITS GOT A WONDERFUL CLEAN BRINY SEA FLAVOR
GgHxdyX3sqI_14 0 IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE USING CLAM JUICE OR YOU DON'T HAVE IT OR IN FACT YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO SHELL FISH THE THING I WOULD USE IS CHICKEN STOCK
GgHxdyX3sqI_15 0 THE THING ABOUT CHICKEN STOCK IS A VERY NEUTRAL STOCK SO IT WILL ALWAYS TAKE ON WHATEVER FLAVOR YOU END UP ADDING AND ONCE WE PUT THE FISH IN THAT CHICKEN FLAVOR WILL REALLY GO AWAY
GgHxdyX3sqI_16 0 OBVIOUSLY IF YOU CLAM AND YOU HAVE FISH YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE MORE OCEAN SWEET FLAVOR BUT THE CHICKEN STOCK REALLY IS QUITE ACCEPTABLE AS WELL
GgHxdyX3sqI_17 0 I TEND TO USE A LOW CHICKEN STOCK BUT THAT IS BECAUSE I WANT TO ADD THE SALT IN TERMS OF HOW THE SEASONING WORKS
GgHxdyX3sqI_18 0 SO OUR NEXT STEP IS TO ADD TEH FLAVORING LIQUID AND IN THIS CASE I AM GOING TO USE CLAM JUICE
GgHxdyX3sqI_19 0 I THINK FOR THIS BATCH WE ARE GOING TO USE ABOUT SIXTEEN OUNCES OF CLAM JUICE
GgHxdyX3sqI_20 0 OUR FLOUR IS COOKED AND YOU CAN SMELL IT AND IT SMELLS A LITTLE BIT LIKE BACON COOKIES IF YOU WILL AND I AM GOING TO TURN OUR HEAT DOWN BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR FLOUR AND OUR LIQUID REALLY GET INCORPORATED
GgHxdyX3sqI_21 0 I WANT IT NICE AND SMOOTH NO LUMPS
GgHxdyX3sqI_22 0 WE GO EIGHT OUNCES IN AND I AM GOING TO ADD THE SECOND BOTTLE AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT IT IS NICE AND SMOOTH
GgHxdyX3sqI_23 0 YOU CAN SEE THE FLOUR AND THE LIQUID HAVE COME TOGETHER AND THERE IS NO LUMPS AND IT JUST TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF STIRRING NOTHING TOO FANCY
GgHxdyX3sqI_24 0 NOW WE GOT IT IN THERE AND IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A STEW NOW WHERE YOU SEE OUR BUILDING BLOCKS ARE GETTING THERE AND WE ARE GOING TO WAIT FOR THAT COME UP TO A SMALL SIMMER AND WE ARE GOING TO THE NEXT STEP
GEhU3uPHqIs_1 0 THIS IS SEAN FROM EXPERT VILLAGE
GEhU3uPHqIs_2 0 WHEN YOU ARE GETTING READY TO DO A 180 OVER A SPINE THERE IS A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO IT
GEhU3uPHqIs_3 0 YOU CAN EITHER FLY UP DO A COMPLETE 180 AND COME DOWN BACKWARDS OR A REAL EASY WAY THE WAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IS JUST TO TAP YOUR FRONT TIRE ON IT AND THEN GO BACKWARDS OVER IT
GEhU3uPHqIs_4 0 THE REASON THAT IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE BETTER FOR YOU WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO LEARN THE OVER TOOTHPICK TO FAKIE IS BECAUSE IT WILL GET YOU USED TO HITTING YOUR TIRE ON THE FRONT OR YOUR PEG ON THE SPINE AND THEN GOING TO FAKIE
GEhU3uPHqIs_5 0 SO IT'S A GOOD WAY TO LEARN BOTH AT ONCE WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS GO FAST ENOUGH TO GO ON THE FRONT TIRE AND USING A LITTLE BIT OF PRECISION YOU HAVE TO BE CONFIDENT
GEhU3uPHqIs_6 0 TO BE ABLE TO HIT YOUR TIRE BETWEEN THE TWO COPINGS OF THE SPINE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS PLACE YOUR TIRE RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN THE TWO COPINGS THAT WAY YOU GET LOCKED IN
GEhU3uPHqIs_7 0 THEN LET YOUR WEIGHT AND MOMENTUM CARRY YOU BACK OVER AND YOU'LL GO FAKIE DOWN THE OTHER SIDE THAT IS WHERE YOU FAKIES COME INTO PLAY
GEhU3uPHqIs_8 0 SO WHEN YOU DROP IN GO OVER ACROSS THE SPINE THEN COME DOWN PLACE YOUR TIRE JUST RIGHT WHEN YOUR READY TO JUMP AND GIVE IT A TRY
GEhU3uPHqIs_9 0 JUST REMEMBER JUST TAKE YOUR TIRE RIGHT BETWEEN THE TWO COPINGS THAT WAY YOU DON'T SLIP OUT
GEhU3uPHqIs_10 0 LET YOUR MOMENTUM TAKE YOU AND GO TO FAKIE
G6hxHfRdyXY_1 0 HI I AM THERESA AND I AM HERE TO SHOW YOU HOW TO USE A DIFFUSER AND WHICH ONE TO LOOK FOR AT THE STORE
G6hxHfRdyXY_2 0 REYNA HERE HAS PRETTY STRAIGHT HAIR AND SHE WANTS TO GO AND SHE WANTS TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT LOOK AND SHE IS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE USING THE CURLING IRON AND SHE DOES NOT HAVE TIME TO SIT HERE AND ROLL HER HAIR IN HOT ROLLERS
G6hxHfRdyXY_3 0 SO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS WE ARE GOING TO ATTACH A DIFFUSER TO THE END OF A DRYER
G6hxHfRdyXY_4 0 YOU CAN GET THIS AT YOUR LOCAL BEAUTY SUPPLY
G6hxHfRdyXY_5 0 A LOT OF THEM HAVE ATTACHMENTS THAT CAN GO ON AND GO ONTO YOUR DRYER
G6hxHfRdyXY_6 0 PUT THIS ON RIGHT HERE JUST SIMPLE ATTACHES TO THE DRYER
G6hxHfRdyXY_7 0 THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS TO DO THIS WHEN YOUR HAIR IS WET
G6hxHfRdyXY_8 0 YOU DO WANT TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF MOUSSE IN YOUR HAIR A LITTLE BIT OF GEL LITTLE BIT OF STYLING PRODUCT FOR YOUR HAIR TYPE TO SET THAT CURL
G6hxHfRdyXY_9 0 AGAIN IT IS NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU A CURL IT IS GOING TO GIVE YOU A NICE LITTLE WAVE
G6hxHfRdyXY_10 0 SO IF SOMEBODY HAS REALLY STRAIGHT HAIR OR EVEN SHORT HAIR THIS IS GREAT TO GIVE YOU THAT DIFFERENT LOOK FOR THE NIGHT
G6hxHfRdyXY_11 0 AND WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS HAVE REYNA FLIP HER HEAD OVER FOR ME PLEASE
G6hxHfRdyXY_12 0 AND WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS JUST GET THIS GOT THE HOT HEAT COMING ON AND YOU DO WANT TO USE YOUR COOL SHOT ON YOUR DRYER TO SET THAT CURL
G6hxHfRdyXY_13 0 SO YOU SIMPLE HOLD THAT UP THERE
G6hxHfRdyXY_14 0 HOLD IT UP THERE AND THE TEETH ARE REALLY NICE BECAUSE IT REALLY GETS THAT HAIR IN THERE
G6hxHfRdyXY_15 0 AND JUST DO THIS ALL OVER THE HEAD UNTIL IT GIVES YOU THAT NICE LITTLE WAVE
G6hxHfRdyXY_16 0 YOU CAN ALSO HAVE YOUR HEAD FLIPPED BACK ON THE CHAIR IF THAT IS EASIER FOR YOU
G6hxHfRdyXY_17 0 AND JUST THEN USE IT THIS WAY AND JUST PUSH IT ALL THE WAY TO YOUR HEAD
G6hxHfRdyXY_18 0 SO YOU GET ALL THAT HAIR IN THERE AND YOU JUST PUSH IT UP LIKE THAT
G6hxHfRdyXY_19 0 THE MORE GEL YOU HAVE THE MORE IT WILL HOLD
G6hxHfRdyXY_20 0 YOU CAN ALSO WET YOUR HAIR DOWN AGAIN AFTER YOU HAVE DONE IT TO MIST IT DOWN AND DO IT AGAIN
G6hxHfRdyXY_21 0 THE MORE YOU DO IT THE MORE YOU LOOK LIKE YOU JUST HAD A LITTLE PERM IN YOUR HOUSE
G6hxHfRdyXY_22 0 AND THAT IS A DIFFUSER

HH4LeJg32vU_3 0 SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR YARN AND YOU CAN USE ANY GAGE THAT YOU LIKE
HH4LeJg32vU_4 0 I PREFER FINER YARNS FOR SCARVES BECAUSE THEY TEND TO BE A LITTLE BIT LESS ITCHY A LITTLE BIT SOFTER
HH4LeJg32vU_5 0 SO WITH THE END OF YOUR YARN YOU'RE GOING TO WRAP IT AROUND YOUR FINGER WRAP IT AROUND YOUR FINGER AND THEN YOU GET THAT NICE LITTLE PRETZEL THING GOING

HH4LeJg32vU_7 0 NOW THIS SCARF IS NOT GOING TO BE TOO WIDE
HH4LeJg32vU_8 0 AGAIN THIS PARTICULAR SCARF IS MORE FOR A WARMER CLIMATE OR A WARMER SEASON SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT TOO WIDE

H0Wq637D78w_2 0 AND I WANT TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T DO WITH A TELESCOPE
H0Wq637D78w_3 0 ONE OF THE MAIN CALLS WE GET AT DYER WOULD BE I WANT A TELESCOPE IN ORDER TO SEE METEOR SHOWERS
H0Wq637D78w_4 0 WELL A TELESCOPE REALLY WON'T HELP YOU FOR METEOR SHOWERS
H0Wq637D78w_5 0 ACTUALLY THE TELESCOPE THAT YOU NEED TO USE THE TELESCOPES ARE RIGHT HERE YOUR EYES
H0Wq637D78w_6 0 THE BEST WAY TO OBSERVE A METEOR SHOWER IS TO FIND A DARK FIELD SOMEWHERE AWAY FROM THE CITY GLOW
H0Wq637D78w_7 0 IN NASHVILLE WE HAVE A CITY GLOW THAT EXTENDS OUT ABOUT FIFTY MILES FROM CITY CENTER
H0Wq637D78w_8 0 AND IT'S IDEAL FOR A METEOR SHOWER IF YOU GET WAY OUTSIDE THAT GLOW AND GET TO A DARK SKY SITE IN A FIELD
H0Wq637D78w_9 0 WEAR COMFORTABLE CLOTHES BECAUSE A LOT OF THE GOOD METEOR SHOWERS ARE IN THE WINTER AND THE FALL
H0Wq637D78w_10 0 AND TAKE A BLANKET LIE DOWN ON THE GROUND AND LOOK AT AS LARGE A SWATHS OF SKY AS YOU CAN
H0Wq637D78w_11 0 THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO OBSERVE A METEOR SHOWER
H0Wq637D78w_12 0 AND YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE YOUR TELESCOPE WITH YOU IN ORDER TO SEE THE THINGS SOME OF THE OBJECTS THAT YOU'D SEE IN BETWEEN WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR METEORS
H0Wq637D78w_13 0 NOW ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO CONSIDER IF YOU'RE USING A TELESCOPE IN A CITY IS THAT THE FAINT OBJECTS THE GALAXIES THE DIM STAR CLUSTERS ARE NOT GOING TO BE AS VISIBLE FROM CITY BECAUSE OF THE CITY GLOW
H0Wq637D78w_14 0 SO IN CASES LIKE THAT JUST WITH A METEOR SHOWER YOU WOULD NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THE CITY AND GO OUT TO A STATE PARK
H0Wq637D78w_15 0 OR TRY TO GET FIFTY A HUNDRED MILES AWAY FROM ANY BRIGHT CITY LIGHTS AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE FAINTER OBJECTS

HibhHJf-sCI_5 0 WHEN HAVING JUST NOTHING ON AND JUST HAVING THE MAIN MONITOR LEVEL I CAN ADJUST IT RIGHT HERE RIGHT
HibhHJf-sCI_6 0 BUT WHAT I CAN ALSO DO IS SWITCH MY ALTERNATE MONITORS PRETTY EASILY JUST BY HITTING THAT BUTTON
HibhHJf-sCI_7 0 ONCE I DO THAT THESE MONITORS WILL PLAY
HibhHJf-sCI_8 0 AND I CAN SWITCH BETWEEN THE TWO PRETTY EASILY AND PRETTY QUICKLY DURING MY PLAYBACK OR MY RECORDING
HibhHJf-sCI_9 0 NOW THERE'S ALSO EXTERNAL SOURCES AND OTHER WAYS OF LISTENING TO IT

Gubqbu38bVA_4 0 TO DO THE TO CUT THE VEE YOU WANT TO ENTER IN WITH THE LONG POINT OF THE SKEW REST THE TOOL DOWN AND AGAIN KEEP IT UP HIGH AND IN FACT LETTING IT RUB AGAINST THE WOOD IS IDEAL

GzWZnjRKlI8_1 0 OKAY IN A RAW LIVE FOOD DIET
GzWZnjRKlI8_2 0 FLUIDS IS VERY IMPORTANT
GzWZnjRKlI8_3 0 A LOT OF TIMES WHEN WE SIT DOWN TO THE TABLE AND EAT YOU HAVE A DRINK WITH YOU
GzWZnjRKlI8_4 0 EVERY TIME YOU EAT AND DRINK YOU'RE DILUTING THE DIGESTIVE PROCESS
GzWZnjRKlI8_5 0 BASICALLY WHEN YOU EAT FOOD IT'S ALL ABOUT DIGESTION
GzWZnjRKlI8_6 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO DILUTE THAT PROCESS THEN YOU'RE GOING TO DESTROY THE WHOLE IDEA OF GETTING THESE NUTRIENTS TO YOU
GzWZnjRKlI8_7 0 SO IN A RAW LIVE FOOD DIET WE LIKE TO STICK TO IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DRINK WE DON'T EAT FOR THIRTY MINUTES
GzWZnjRKlI8_8 0 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ANY KIND OF FLUIDS
GzWZnjRKlI8_9 0 IF WE'RE GOING TO EAT THEN WE EAT THE FOOD AND WE WAIT FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO HOURS BEFORE WE TAKE IN ANY FLUIDS SO IT GIVES US TIME TO DIGEST THE FOOD THAT WE ATE
GzWZnjRKlI8_10 0 THEREFORE ALL THESE NUTRIENTS THAT YOU WANT TO TAKE IF YOU ADHERE TO THIS SIMPLE RULE OF IF YOU'RE GOING TO DRINK WAIT THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE YOU EAT
GzWZnjRKlI8_11 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO EAT WAIT TWO HOURS BEFORE YOU START DRINKING SO THAT YOU CAN DIGEST
GzWZnjRKlI8_12 0 THIS IS BASIC ONE OF THE FEW RULES IN A RAW LIVE FOOD DIET
Hf5_c8yAENQ_1 0 THE NEXT TRICK WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU IS THE SLEEPER
Hf5_c8yAENQ_2 0 IT LOOKS LIKE THIS
Hf5_c8yAENQ_3 0 YOU NOTICE THE YO-YO IS JUST SPINNING RIGHT AT THE END OF THE STRING
Hf5_c8yAENQ_4 0 THIS IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT MOST OF THE TRICKS THAT WE'RE GOING TO WORKING ON IS FOUNDED ON
Hf5_c8yAENQ_5 0 IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU PRACTICE THIS AND YOU GET A REALLY STRONG SPINNING SLEEPER
Hf5_c8yAENQ_6 0 IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU A LOT WHEN YOU MOVE ON TO THE HARDER TRICKS
Hf5_c8yAENQ_7 0 VERY MUCH LIKE THE GRAVITY PULL
Hf5_c8yAENQ_8 0 START YOUR HAND OUT THE SAME WAY
Hf5_c8yAENQ_9 0 BRING YOUR HAND ALL THE WAY OUT
Hf5_c8yAENQ_10 0 WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR MUSCLE YOU DO IT THE SAME EXACT WAY
Hf5_c8yAENQ_11 0 YOU'RE ACTUALLY EVEN GOING TO THROW THE SAME WAY
Hf5_c8yAENQ_12 0 THE ONE THING YOU WANT TO DO DIFFERENTLY IS WHEN YOU DO THROW YOU SNAP YOUR ARM OUT AND YOU DON'T MOVE IT
Hf5_c8yAENQ_13 0 ONE OF THE PROBLEMS PEOPLE HAVE WHEN THEY FIRST START THROWING A YO-YO IS THEY'LL IMMEDIATELY WANT TO TURN THEIR HAND OVER
Hf5_c8yAENQ_14 0 YOU'LL ACTUALLY WANT YOUR HAND AND PALM UP
Hf5_c8yAENQ_15 0 IT'S LOOKS LIKE THIS
Hf5_c8yAENQ_16 0 BRING YOUR ARM UP JUST LIKE GRAVITY PULL
Hf5_c8yAENQ_17 0 SHOOT AND SNAP YOUR WRIST STRAIGHT OUT AND THE YO-YO COMES RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HAND
Hf5_c8yAENQ_18 0 THAT'LL PRODUCE A REALLY STRONG SPINNING YO-YO
Hf5_c8yAENQ_19 0 ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE THROWING IS WHEN YOU DO SNAP YOUR WRIST OUT LIKE THAT THAT YOU DON'T BOUNCE IT
Hf5_c8yAENQ_20 0 IT NEEDS TO BE REALLY STRAIGHT SNAP LIKE THAT
Hf5_c8yAENQ_21 0 THEN WHEN YOU'RE READY TO CATCH THE YO-YO YOU ACTUALLY TAKE YOUR HAND AND TURN IT FROM THE PALM UP POSITION TO THE PALM DOWN POSITION
Hf5_c8yAENQ_22 0 IT'S JUST A VERY SLIGHT TUG
Hf5_c8yAENQ_23 0 YOU'LL SEE IT'S THE SLIGHTEST TUG
Hf5_c8yAENQ_24 0 YOU DON'T GO AND GRAB THE YO-YO
Hf5_c8yAENQ_25 0 YOU JUST LET IT COME TO YOUR HAND
Hf5_c8yAENQ_26 0 IT'S GOING TO SNAP RIGHT INTO YOUR HAND AND IT'S GOING TO BE THE EASIEST WAY TO CATCH
Hf5_c8yAENQ_27 0 PRACTICE THIS GET A REALLY STRONG THROW AND GET IT SO THAT WITH THE SLIGHTEST TUG YOU CAN CATCH IT AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING GREAT FOR THE NEXT TRICKS

H5JYID7nD6s_7 0 SEE THAT STRETCH ON MY LINE HOW MY HAND IS ACTUALLY STRETCHED OUT LIKE THAT AND THAT IS WHAT MONOFILAMENT HAS
H5JYID7nD6s_8 0 IT HAS A LITTLE STRETCH POINT BEFORE THE BREAK POINT

H5JYID7nD6s_10 0 THEY REALLY CUT THROUGH THE WATER REALLY GREAT SO WHEN YOU ARE DROPPING LIVE BAITS AND THINGS LIKE THAT REAL DEEP THEY REALLY CUT THROUGH THE WATER REALLY REALLY WELL
H5JYID7nD6s_11 0 THEY WILL GET YOUR BAIT DOWN PRETTY PRETTY QUICKLY AND ONCE AGAIN THE MONOFILAMENT HAS STRETCH
H5JYID7nD6s_12 0 THE SPIDER LINE NO STRETCH I MEAN LOOK
H5JYID7nD6s_13 0 I CAN OUT CUT MY FINGERS BUT YOU WILL NOT STRETCH THIS LINE
H5JYID7nD6s_14 0 IT WILL BREAK AT 85 POUND TUCKS

gzG253zUOpE_1 0 THE BASIC DEFINITION OF A MASSAGE IS THAT IT IS DELIBERATE FOCUSED TOUCH
gzG253zUOpE_2 0 WHETHER IT IS COMPROMISED OF OR COMPRISED OF A DIFFERENT SORTS OF STROKES WHETHER YOU ARE USING ONE TYPE OF STROKE OVER THE ENTIRE BODY OF YOUR HORSE BUT IT IS FOCUSED DELIBERATE TOUCH THAT IS DONE FOR EITHER THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES OR FOR RELAXATION OR TO HELP THE HORSE RECOVER FROM AN ILLNESS OR AN INJURY
gzG253zUOpE_3 0 THERE ARE AND THAT COVERS QUITE A LOT OF TERRITORY

gzG253zUOpE_5 0 IT CAN BE DONE USING THE BACK OF YOUR HAND IT CAN BE DONE USING OTHER TOOLS THAT YOU FIND ALSO
gzG253zUOpE_6 0 BUT I THINK OF IT PRIMARILY AS DELIBERATE FOCUSED TOUCHING USUALLY WITH MY HANDS AND OCCASIONALLY WITH GROOMING TOOLS

gxXMrxDdSus_2 0 HI MY NAME IS DEAN HALE AND TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO SET UP A BACKGAMMON BOARD
gxXMrxDdSus_3 0 TO SETUP A BACKGAMMON BOARD YOU FIRST NEED TO KNOW HOW TO COUNT YOUR POINTS
gxXMrxDdSus_4 0 IF YOU ARE GOING TO START FROM HERE AND COUNT AROUND
gxXMrxDdSus_5 0 SO THIS IS ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX AND SO ON ALL THE WAY UP HERE TO POINT TWENTY FOUR
gxXMrxDdSus_6 0 IN POINT TWENTY FOUR YOU ARE GOING TO SET UP TWO IN POINT TWENTY FOUR
gxXMrxDdSus_7 0 AS YOU GO AROUND IN POINT THIRTEEN YOU ARE GOING TO SET UP FIVE
gxXMrxDdSus_8 0 OVER HERE IN POINT EIGHT YOU ARE GOING TO SET UP THREE PIECES AND IN POINT SIX YOU ARE GOING TO SET UP FIVE
gxXMrxDdSus_9 0 THE OTHER PLAYER WILL OBVIOUSLY DO THE SAME THING
gxXMrxDdSus_10 0 REMEMBER YOU COUNT FROM YOUR RIGHT AS YOUR FIRST NUMBER AND THE UPPER RIGHT IS YOUR HIGHEST NUMBER

GtrYWhU8Tn4_1 0 OKAY NOW THAT WE HAVE CONNECTED OUR YARN TO START OUR SECOND LEVEL I AM GOING TO CHAIN UP TWO JUST AS BEFORE AND YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE YOUR SECOND ONE AND YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE YOUR THIRD ONE
GtrYWhU8Tn4_2 0 THE REST OF THE PROCESS IS THE SAME AS A REGULAR GRANNY SQUARE YOU ARE GOING TO CHAIN TWO AND YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE YOUR NEXT SECTION OF THREE COLUMNS AND YOU ARE GOING TO CHAIN ONE GO UNDER AND YOU ARE GOING TO DO THIS TO ALL OF YOUR CORNERS JUST AS YOU WOULD IN A REGULAR GRANNY SQUARE
GtrYWhU8Tn4_3 0 THIS PART IS THE SAME
GtrYWhU8Tn4_4 0 THE ONLY PART THAT IS DIFFERENT IS THE END SO CONTINUE AND WE WILL MEET YOU THERE TO SHOW YOU HOW TO END THE SECOND LEVEL
GoZy_PICnGM_1 0 NOW SOME OF THE GROUPS LIKE COMEDY SPORTS OR SOME OF THE THEATER GROUPS THEY'LL RAISE THE CHALLENGE ON THAT WHERE THEY'LL TAKE TURNS WITH EACH LETTER OF THE ALPHABET
GoZy_PICnGM_2 0 THEY'LL START ON ONE THEY CHOSE FROM THE AUDIENCE LIKE SAY âL' AND THEY'LL GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH FROM âL' BACK AROUND THROUGH âZ' AND âA' ALL THE WAY BACK TO âL' AND THEN THEY'LL TRY TO FINISH GOING BACKWARDS FROM âL'
GoZy_PICnGM_3 0 ONCE THEY'VE DONE ALL TWENTY SIX THEY'LL WORK BACKWARDS FROM âL' AND SO THAT'S AN INTERESTING WAY TO DO THAT
GoZy_PICnGM_4 0 NOW IT'S A GOOD PERFORMANCE GAME IT'S A GOOD WARM-UP GAME BUT IT'S ALSO A GREAT GAME THAT YOU CAN PLAY IN THE CAR SO THAT YOU'RE PLAYING THESE GAMES AND KEEPING THE SKILLS CLOSE TO YOU
GoZy_PICnGM_5 0 YOU CAN KNOCK IT OUT ANYTIME FOR ANY CONVERSATION AND IT TENDS TO PUT A LITTLE SURPRISE INTO WHAT YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE THAT SMALL FILTER OF HAVING TO CHOOSE THE LETTER
GoZy_PICnGM_6 0 IT'S NOT LIKE THAT'S THE HARDEST TASK YOU'LL EVER DO IN IMPROVISATION BUT IT MIGHT CAUSE YOU TO MAKE A CHOICE THAT'S INTERESTING AND YOU STICK WITH IT
GoZy_PICnGM_7 0 IT'S A CHOICE THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN IF YOU WEREN'T PLAYING A GAME
GoZy_PICnGM_8 0 SO THOSE GAMES MIGHT BE ABC SCENES OR ALPHABET MONOLOGUES OR ALPHABET THEMES DIFFERENT GROUPS ARE GOING TO CALL THEM DIFFERENT THINGS BUT IT'S ALL THAT SAME BASIC SKILL
H7JNrI8IDMY_1 0 OKAY A VOLLEY IT'S ONE OF THOSE UNDER-PRACTICED SHOTS IN TENNIS
H7JNrI8IDMY_2 0 ALL A VOLLEY IS IS YOU TAKE A BALL BEFORE IT BOUNCES SO OBVIOUSLY IF A BALL BOUNCES LIKE THIS THAT'S A GROUND STROKE
H7JNrI8IDMY_3 0 BUT IF THE BALL IS IN THE AIR AND YOU HIT IT THAT'S A VOLLEY
H7JNrI8IDMY_4 0 THERE'S TWO VOLLEYS THERE'S THE FOREHAND VOLLEY AND THE BACKHAND
H7JNrI8IDMY_5 0 HERE'S THE FOREHAND VOLLEY HERE'S THE BACKHAND VOLLEY
H7JNrI8IDMY_6 0 WE USE WHAT'S CALLED THE CONTINENTAL GRIP
H7JNrI8IDMY_7 0 SO IT'S LIKE A SHAKE-HANDS GRIP THEN YOU JUST SLIGHTLY TURN IT
H7JNrI8IDMY_8 0 AND YOU USE IT FOR BOTH SIDES
H7JNrI8IDMY_9 0 SO IF ANY OF YOU EVER WATCH ANY PIRATE MOVIES THERE'S YOUR BACKHAND THERE'S YOUR FOREHAND
H7JNrI8IDMY_10 0 SO IT'S AS IF YOU WERE SWORD FIGHTING WITH SOMEBODY AND IN A SENSE YOU ARE
H7JNrI8IDMY_11 0 INSTEAD OF HITTING EACH OTHER YOU'RE HITTING THE BALL
H7JNrI8IDMY_12 0 BUT LET'S STEP OVER TO THE WALL AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO HIT THE FOREHAND VOLLEY
H7JNrI8IDMY_13 0 SO YOU TAKE THE BALL YOU TAKE THE RACKET YOU OPEN THE FACE AND YOU JUST BLOCK IT AGAINST THE WALL AND THAT'S A FOREHAND VOLLEY RIGHT THERE
H7JNrI8IDMY_14 0 AND THEN I CLICK OVER TO THE BACKHAND AND WE HIT A BACKHAND VOLLEY
H7JNrI8IDMY_15 0 AND THEN YOU CAN HIT BOTH OF THEM
H7JNrI8IDMY_16 0 NOW THE WALL FORCES ME TO MOVE MY FEET
H7JNrI8IDMY_17 0 IT FORCES ME TO PREPARE MY RACKET SO YOU SEE I HIT THE BALL I CAN'T HAVE THE RACKET JUST DROP DEAD
H7JNrI8IDMY_18 0 I'VE GOT TO HIT IT AND BE READY FOR THE NEXT ONE
H7JNrI8IDMY_19 0 HIT IT BE READY FOR THE NEXT ONE
H7JNrI8IDMY_20 0 SO THE VOLLEY IS A VERY IMPORTANT STROKE AND IN THE NEXT SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO DEMONSTRATE HOW TO ACTUALLY USE IT IN A GAME SITUATION
gvKhBqPqtVM_1 0 ALRIGHT THE DRINK WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE IS THE CHARGER
gvKhBqPqtVM_2 0 FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS PUT SOME ICE IN A GLASS AND WE GOT A MARTINI GLASS READY TO GO AND YOU WANT TO GET THIS CHILLED
gvKhBqPqtVM_3 0 PUT SOME WATER AND ICE IN THERE AND LET IT SIT
gvKhBqPqtVM_4 0 WHILE YOUR MAKING YOUR DRINK
gvKhBqPqtVM_5 0 MEASURE OUT ONE SHOT OF DARK RUM AND FOLLOW THAT UP
gvKhBqPqtVM_6 0 WITH A HALF A SHOT OF CHERRY BRANDY
gvKhBqPqtVM_7 0 WHOOPS HERE WE GO
gvKhBqPqtVM_8 0 NEXT THING WE'RE GOING TO ADD IS ABOUT A HALF ONCE OF LEMON JUICE
gvKhBqPqtVM_9 0 THAT'LL WORK AND THEN HALF A TEASPOON OF SUGAR
gvKhBqPqtVM_10 0 MEASURE THAT OUT AND HERE WE GO AND LETS MIX ALL THESE INGREDIENTS UP REAL GOOD AND THIS WILL BE NICE AND COLD AND WE'RE GOING TO STRAIN IT INTO OUR MARTINI GLASS AND SERVE IT UP
gvKhBqPqtVM_11 0 SO MARTINI GLASS IS READY
gvKhBqPqtVM_12 0 SET THAT UP THERE
gvKhBqPqtVM_13 0 GRAB YOUR STRAINER AND POUR IT IN AND YOU HAVE YOURSELF A CHARGER
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_1 0 SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE PUT THE TUNER COVERS ONTO THE GUITAR
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_2 0 IT'S A TRICKY PROCESS BECAUSE THEY DON'T SCREW ON BUT THEY NEED A FIRM PUSH TO GET INTO PLACE
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_3 0 WELL WE ALREADY HAVE OUR TUNERS ON THE GUITAR
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_4 0 SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO GET OVER THIS TUNER THEN PUSH DOWN ON THIS TUNER COVER AND REALLY GET IT INTO PLACE FIRM
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_5 0 BECAUSE THE FIRMNESS OF THIS TUNER COVER IS GOING TO DETERMINE HOW FIRM OUR TUNER IS HELD INTO PLACE WHICH IS GOING TO DETERMINE HOW FIRM OUR STRING IS HELD TO THE GUITAR WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_6 0 SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT WE DO
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_7 0 WE PUT IT DOWN INTO PLACE AND IT'S GOT A LOT OF FRICTION ON IT RIGHT THERE BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE IT TIGHT
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_8 0 YOU GET A PLASTIC PIECE THAT CAN FIT OVER IT SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO PUT ANY METAL WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE JAMMING IT IN TO PLACE
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_9 0 WE'RE JUST GOING TO GENTLY TAP IT DOWN USING OUR PLASTIC PIECE GETTING ALL THE SIDES
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_10 0 AND THERE YOU GO
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_11 0 WE'VE ATTACHED OUR TUNER COVER WE HAVEN'T AFFECTED THE WOOD IT'S LOOKING GOOD
guUkTXUwAAk_1 0 HI I'M TY BROWN WITH DOGBEHAVIORONLINE.COM TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO TRAIN A DOG
guUkTXUwAAk_2 0 THE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW IS HOW TO TRAIN A DOG TO GO SWIMMING
guUkTXUwAAk_3 0 NOW A LOT OF DOGS WILL NATURALLY LIKE TO GO SWIMMING BUT A LOT OF DOGS NEED TO LEARN HOW TO BE TAUGHT
guUkTXUwAAk_4 0 THEY HAVE TO BE TAUGHT TO GO SWIMMING AND SO THERE'S A COUPLE KEY ASPECTS AND A COUPLE KEY POINTS OF HOW TO TEACH YOUR DOG TO GO SWIMMING
guUkTXUwAAk_5 0 NOW THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TEACH YOUR DOG WHERE THE ENTRIES AND EXITS ARE WHETHER IT BE A RIVER A POND A STREAM OR A POOL THE DOG NEEDS TO KNOW HOW TO GET IN SAFELY AND HOW TO GET OUT SAFELY
guUkTXUwAAk_6 0 DOGS THAT STRUGGLE WITH SWIMMING OFTEN STRUGGLE BECAUSE THEY'RE NERVOUS ABOUT HOW DO THEY GET OUT AND SO THE FIRST THING TO DO IS SHOW THAT DOG HOW TO GET OUT OF A POOL HOW TO GET OUT OF THE STREAM OR WHEREVER HE'S AT
guUkTXUwAAk_7 0 THE SECOND THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TRY TO USE MOTIVATION TO TEACH THAT DOG TO SWIM
guUkTXUwAAk_8 0 SO MAYBE IF A DOG LOVES A BALL THROW A BALL OUT INTO THE WATER
guUkTXUwAAk_9 0 SEE IF HE'LL GO OUT THERE TO GET IT WHEN HE GOES OUT PRAISE HIM HEAVILY AND ALLOW HIM TO GET THAT BALL
guUkTXUwAAk_10 0 IF HE LOVES FOOD HE SOMEBODY OUT THERE IN THE WATER WITH SOME FOOD
guUkTXUwAAk_11 0 IF HE HAS A FAVORITE PERSON HAVE THAT PERSON GO OUT INTO THE WATER AND ENTICE THAT DOG TO COME IN
guUkTXUwAAk_12 0 WHATEVER IT IS TRY TO USE MOTIVATION
guUkTXUwAAk_13 0 NOW THERE ARE THOSE DOGS THAT NEED TO GO SWIMMING BUT DON'T REALLY HAVE MOTIVATION TO GET IN THE WATER AND SO FOR THOSE DOGS WE CAN USE A LEASH TO HELP OBLIGE THEM IN THE WATER AND AGAIN SHOW THEM HOW TO GET OUT
guUkTXUwAAk_14 0 NOW MOST DOGS IF YOU CAN SHOW THEM TIME AND TIME AGAIN HOW TO GET IN THE WATER HOW TO GET OUT AND THAT WHILE THEY'RE IN THERE IT'S A LOT OF FUN THEY'RE GOING TO EVENTUALLY LEARN TO ENJOY SWIMMING
guUkTXUwAAk_15 0 SO IN ORDER TO TEACH YOUR DOG WHERE THE EXISTS AND ENTRIES ARE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS USE A LEASH AND USE A LEASH AS A TOOL FOR COMMUNICATION
guUkTXUwAAk_16 0 SO LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE THAT THIS LINE HERE IS THE WATER LINE NOW IF I WANTED BY DOG TO GO IN ROCCO GO SWIMMING
guUkTXUwAAk_17 0 I'D GET HIM IN AND IMMEDIATELY GET HIM RIGHT BACK OUT
guUkTXUwAAk_18 0 SO THAT HE KNOWS WHERE THE ENTRY IS AND WHERE THE EXIT IS AND THAT HE KNOWS THAT HAVE CAN HAVE VICTORY GETTING OUT LIKE THAT AND SO I WOULD DO THAT NUMEROUS TIMES IN ORDER FOR HIM TO START FEELING COMFORTABLE EACH TIME ALLOWING HIM TO GO OUT FURTHER INTO WATER
guUkTXUwAAk_19 0 ROCCO GO SWIMMING
guUkTXUwAAk_21 0 COME ON GOOD BOY
guUkTXUwAAk_22 0 GOOD BOY AND THAT'S HOW YOU TEACH YOUR DOG TO GO SWIMMING

ggbV7YeSl7k_1 0 IN THIS SECTION WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS SOME METHODS YOU CAN USE IN DEALING WITH TOUGH CUSTOMERS
ggbV7YeSl7k_2 0 I'M PAMELA UNRUH ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
ggbV7YeSl7k_3 0 AS AN EMPLOYER ASKING YOUR EMPLOYEES TO PROVIDE GREAT CUSTOMERS SERVICE IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT YOU'RE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING THEM THE TOOLS THAT THEY CAN USE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS
ggbV7YeSl7k_4 0 NOW IF YOU HAVE EMPLOYEES THAT YOU'VE HIRED WHO ARE UNEXPERIENCED WITH DEALING WITH CUSTOMERS IN CALL CENTERS WE HIRED A LOT OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS OR PEOPLE WHO HAVE JUST GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL AGAIN NOT A LONG CAREER RECORD BEHIND THEM
ggbV7YeSl7k_5 0 A LOT OF TIMES THEY JUST HAVEN'T PRACTICED WITH THE SKILLS THAT ARE NEEDED THAT YOU MAY EXPECT THEM TO USE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE
ggbV7YeSl7k_6 0 NOW THIS IS WHERE EDUCATION COMES IN
ggbV7YeSl7k_7 0 YOU CAN UTILIZE SEVERAL DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WHETHER YOU HAVE A FORMAL TRAINING CLASS FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES ON CUSTOMER SERVICE OR JUST A MATTER OF GETTING TOGETHER ONCE A WEEK OR BI-WEEKLY JUST TO DO SOME ROLE PLAYING AND HAVE THEM DISCUSS WHAT THEY FOUND WORKED FOR THEM
ggbV7YeSl7k_8 0 AGAIN IF YOU HAVE AN EMPLOYEE WHO PERHAPS JUST GOT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL MAYBE THEY'RE MORE FAMILIAR WITH USING MORE INFORMAL VERNACULAR WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND MAY NOT REALIZE THAT IN A PROFESSIONAL ENVIRONMENT IT JUST DOESN'T QUIET WORK WITH CUSTOMERS
ggbV7YeSl7k_9 0 YOU CAN TEACH THEM THESE TACTICS GO OVER ROLE PLAYING EXERCISES AGAIN WHEN YOU FIND THEM SAYING SOMETHING PERHAPS INAPPROPRIATE ON THE PHONE OR NOT VERY PROFESSIONAL JUST POINT OUT
ggbV7YeSl7k_10 0 ALWAYS START WITH A POSITIVE SAY YOU KNOW YOU SOUND VERY FRIENDLY WITH THE CUSTOMER BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER REPHRASING WHAT YOU JUST SAID TO THE CUSTOMER THIS WAY
ggbV7YeSl7k_11 0 SO SHOW THEM GUIDANCE BE COMMITTED TO EDUCATION BE SURE THAT IF YOU'RE ASKING YOUR EMPLOYEES TO PROVIDE THIS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE YOU'RE ALSO GIVING THEM THE EDUCATION AND THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE IT THE WAY THAT YOU WANT IT DONE

gfnHsbYi56k_1 0 IN THIS SECTION I'M GOING TO COVER STEP SEVEN OF THE BREAST STROKE
gfnHsbYi56k_2 0 SO REMEMBER AGAIN YOU STARTED OFF PRAYER POSITION
gfnHsbYi56k_3 0 WHEN YOU BEGIN YOUR KICK YOU'RE SLICING INTO THE WATER WITH A GLIDE FOR ABOUT THREE TO GIVE SECONDS
gfnHsbYi56k_4 0 ONCE THAT GLIDE IS STARTING TO SLOW DOWN WHEN YOU'RE DOING BREAST STROKE THEN WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO END UP DOING IS JUST FACING YOUR HANDS YOU KNOW TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND THEN DOING A PULL
gfnHsbYi56k_5 0 AND YOU'RE GOING TO PULL BACK JUST LIKE BASICALLY LIKE A LIKE AN S JUST LIKE A HALF CIRCLE WITH YOUR HANDS AND MAKE SURE YOUR HANDS ARE FULLY CLOSED AND YOU'LL PULL
gfnHsbYi56k_6 0 AND WHEN YOU DO END UP PULLING YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP FOR AIR AND THAT'S WHEN YOU'LL TAKE YOUR BREATH IF YOU NEED IT IT'S UP TO YOU BUT YOU'LL TAKE YOUR BREATH FOR AIR AND THEN YOU'LL PUT YOUR HEAD BACK IN THE WATER AND GO AGAIN
gfnHsbYi56k_7 0 SO LET ME JUST RECAP THAT REAL QUICK FOR YOU GUYS THE REASON WHY YOU WANT TO DO THAT
gfnHsbYi56k_8 0 SO AS YOU'RE GLIDING RIGHT
gfnHsbYi56k_9 0 YOU'RE SLICING THROUGH THE WATER
gfnHsbYi56k_10 0 YOUR HEADS IN THE WATER
gfnHsbYi56k_11 0 ONCE YOUR GLIDE BEGINS TO SLOW DOWN ON THE SEVENTH STEP YOU'LL FACE YOUR HANDS TOWARDS YOUR THE TOP OF YOUR HANDS ARE GOING TO END UP FACING TOWARDS EACH OTHER THEN YOU'RE GOING TO END UP PULLING AND YOU'RE GOING TO PULL LIKE A HALF CIRCLE
gfnHsbYi56k_12 0 SO ENVISION THAT HALF CIRCLE LIKE THIS AND AS YOU'RE PULLING THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP FOR AIR AND YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREATH OKAY
gfnHsbYi56k_13 0 AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD END UP DOING ON THE SEVENTH STEP
gfnHsbYi56k_14 0 AND AS YOU SAW I WAS PRAYER POSITIONED
gfnHsbYi56k_15 0 I SLICED INTO THE WATER
gfnHsbYi56k_16 0 NOW WHAT I'M GOING TO END UP SHOWING YOU IS YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS LIKE A PEDDLE
gfnHsbYi56k_17 0 YOU'RE GOING TO END UP PULLING TOWARDS YOURSELF RIGHT PULLING THE WATER AND AS YOU PULL THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP FOR A BREATH
gfnHsbYi56k_18 0 SO YOU'LL PULL COME UP FOR A BREATH AND THEN CONTINUE YOUR KICK ALRIGHT
gfnHsbYi56k_19 0 SO THIS ONE IS THE SEVENTH PART WHERE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS WHERE YOU ACTUALLY PULL
gfnHsbYi56k_20 0 YOU'RE GOING TO PULL YOURSELF ONCE YOUR LEGS ARE FULLY CLOSED SO YOU'LL LOOK AT MY LEGS AS WELL
gfnHsbYi56k_21 0 SO AFTER I DO MY KICK MY LEGS ARE CLOSED
gfnHsbYi56k_22 0 THAT'S WHEN I'M GOING TO END UP PULLING MYSELF UP FOR A BREATH
gfnHsbYi56k_23 0 SO LET ME SHOW YOU

GmN2IFIkwv8_7 0 IF THERE'S NO SPACE IN BETWEEN THE WOOD AND THE HAIR IT MEANS SOMETHING IS WRONG

HEZIAgMa0VE_2 0 ONE OF THE FUN THINGS ABOUT WATER COLORS ALSO ARE WATER COLOR PENCILS
HEZIAgMa0VE_3 0 AND THEY ARE JUST WHAT THEY SAY THEY ARE THEY'RE WATER COLOR PENCILS
HEZIAgMa0VE_4 0 YOU USE THEM JUST LIKE A PENCIL BUT YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH THEM
HEZIAgMa0VE_5 0 YOU CAN GET DIFFERENT TEXTURES YOU CAN DO DIFFERENT THINGS
HEZIAgMa0VE_6 0 I'M GOING TO DO JUST A LITTLE BIT ON THIS GAL'S BLUE JEANS HERE
HEZIAgMa0VE_7 0 AND I HAVE A BLUE PENCIL AND YOU CAN GO IN AND YOU CAN SHADE YOU CAN DO YOU CAN JUST ADD SOME COLORS
HEZIAgMa0VE_8 0 AND WE'LL GO INTO A LITTLE MORE OF THE TECHNIQUE ON THIS A LITTLE LATER
HEZIAgMa0VE_9 0 BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA YOU CAN LAY THE COLORS DOWN
HEZIAgMa0VE_10 0 I'LL USE WATER COLOR PENCILS A LOT FOR TEXTURING LEATHER AND ALSO ON DENIM BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES ADD A LOT TO GET SOME TEXTURE GOING
HEZIAgMa0VE_11 0 THEN JUST TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF WATER ON YOUR BRUSH AND YOU SIMPLY GO OVER THAT WATER
HEZIAgMa0VE_12 0 TAKE THE WATER GO OVER THE PAINT LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN PULL COLORS OUT
HEZIAgMa0VE_13 0 YOU CAN GET EM TO FADE OUT ON YOU
HEZIAgMa0VE_14 0 AND AGAIN IF I THOUGHT MAYBE THAT COLOR WAS A LITTLE TOO INTENSE WHEN I FIRST PUT IT ON ALL I NEED TO DO IS COME BACK WITH SOME WATER AND SPREAD THAT OUT AND IF I GO THROUGH THAT WITH A FEW DIFFERENT LAYERS WHAT'LL HAPPEN IS I CAN LAYER THAT COLOR UP
HEZIAgMa0VE_15 0 I CAN GET SOME TEXTURE
HEZIAgMa0VE_16 0 AND YOU CAN DO SOME DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT WITH WATER COLOR PENCIL
GSSTK3BhSy8_1 0 HEY THIS IS JEFF AT THE TWO WHEELER DEALER
GSSTK3BhSy8_2 0 TODAY I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO SELECT THE PROPER FENDERS FOR WHATEVER STYLE BIKE YOU RIDE
GSSTK3BhSy8_3 0 TO START OFF YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO PROBABLY DETERMINE WHAT TIRE SIZE YOUR BIKE USES
GSSTK3BhSy8_4 0 IT SHOULD BE LABELED PRETTY CLEARLY ON THE SIDEWALL
GSSTK3BhSy8_5 0 TYPICAL SIZES BEING A TWENTY-SIX INCH AND A SEVEN HUNDRED C FOR TWENTY-SIX INCH BIKES YOU HAVE THE OPTION OF CLIP ON FENDERS SUCH AS THESE
GSSTK3BhSy8_6 0 THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS A FRONT FENDER THAT WILL MOUNT UP BASICALLY STICKING OFF IN FRONT OF THE FRONT WHEEL
GSSTK3BhSy8_7 0 MOUNTING UP INTO THE STEER TUBE AND PROTECTING BACK BEHIND IT
GSSTK3BhSy8_8 0 AND IT CAN BE PAIRED WITH A REAR CLIP ON FENDER AS WELL
GSSTK3BhSy8_9 0 THIS ONE WILL JUST MOUNT AROUND YOUR SEAT TUBE AND BASICALLY COVER BACK OVER THE REAR WHEEL
GSSTK3BhSy8_10 0 THESE ARE ABOUT TWENTY TO TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS EACH
GSSTK3BhSy8_11 0 SO FOR A FULL SET ABOUT FORTY-FIVE OR FIFTY DOLLARS
GSSTK3BhSy8_12 0 THE OTHER OPTION YOU'D HAVE WITH THE TWENTY-SIX INCH WHEELED BIKE WOULD BE A FULL SET OF FENDERS
GSSTK3BhSy8_13 0 WHICH IS GOING TO GIVE YOU THE MOST COVERAGE AND PROBABLY THE YOU KNOW BEST PROTECTION FROM YOU KNOW WATER
GSSTK3BhSy8_14 0 THESE ONES AREN'T GOING TO BE SO GOOD FOR PROTECTING YOU AGAINST MUD BECAUSE THE CLEARANCE BETWEEN THE TIRE AND THE FENDER IS MUCH TIGHTER
GSSTK3BhSy8_15 0 SO IF YOU ARE RIDING THROUGH VERY MUDDY CONDITIONS IT MAY GET JAMMED UP BETWEEN THE FENDER AND THE TIRE
GSSTK3BhSy8_16 0 YOU MIGHT BE BEST OFF WITH THE CLIP ON STYLE
GSSTK3BhSy8_17 0 BUT THESE RUN ABOUT FORTY-FIVE DOLLARS
GSSTK3BhSy8_18 0 PRETTY COMPARABLE IN PRICE TO THE CLIP ONS
GSSTK3BhSy8_19 0 BUT IF YOU'RE JUST RIDING IN THE WATER THESE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU THE BEST PROTECTION
GSSTK3BhSy8_20 0 FOR A SEVEN HUNDRED C BIKE LIKE A ROAD BIKE THEY MAKE THE SAME FULL FENDER SETS
GSSTK3BhSy8_21 0 THESE ONES ARE JUST GOING TO COME IN A NARROWER SIZE TO ACCOMMODATE THE NARROWER TIRE
GSSTK3BhSy8_22 0 SAME PRICE ABOUT FORTY-FIVE TO FIFTY DOLLARS
GSSTK3BhSy8_23 0 THEY DON'T REALLY MAKE CLIP ON ONES FOR ROAD BIKES
GSSTK3BhSy8_24 0 THEY DO BUT THEY DON'T OFFER VERY MUCH COVERAGE
GSSTK3BhSy8_25 0 AND YOU KNOW I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND GOING WITH MORE OF A FULL FENDER SET THAN A CLIP ON ON A ROAD BIKE
GSSTK3BhSy8_26 0 THAT'S HOW TO SELECT PROPER FENDER SIZE FOR WHATEVER SIZE BIKE YOU RIDE
h96TWDJwHn0_1 0 HI I'M JULIE HALLINAN AND WE'RE HERE IN SEDONA ARIZONA AND I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
h96TWDJwHn0_2 0 YELLOW IS THE SOLAR PLEXUS CHAKRA AND THAT'S ABOVE THE NAVEL JUST BELOW THE RIB CAGE UP TO THE RIB CAGE
h96TWDJwHn0_3 0 AND YELLOW CAN HAVE TO DO WITH LIKE YOUR INNER SUN YOUR INNER SUNLIGHT YOUR SENSE OF REALLY WHO YOU ARE AND HOW YOU RADIATE LIGHT A SENSE OF GOOD SELF-ESTEEM
h96TWDJwHn0_4 0 AND YELLOW IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH INSPIRATION AND HAPPINESS SORT OF A LIGHT A LIGHTNESS AN ABILITY TO DANCE WITH LIFE
h96TWDJwHn0_5 0 GREEN FOR THE HEART CHAKRA
h96TWDJwHn0_6 0 AND WE ALL KNOW THE HEART CHAKRA IS ABOUT LOVE OPENNESS EXPANSION
h96TWDJwHn0_7 0 GREEN IS ALSO THE MIDPOINT IN THE CHAKRAS BETWEEN THE LOWER CHAKRAS AND THE UPPER CHAKRAS
h96TWDJwHn0_8 0 SO YOU NOTICE THAT THESE ARE ALL VERY WARM COLORS AND GREEN IS A COOLER COLOR
GHtkz9xBqfg_1 0 HI I'M MIKE LOPEZ WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'LL BE DISCUSSING ARTIFACTS FROM MAGIC THE GATHERING
GHtkz9xBqfg_2 0 AND NOW I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT FIRE SHRIEKER
GHtkz9xBqfg_3 0 FIRE SHRIEKER IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE POWERFUL ARTIFACT EQUIPMENT WHICH ONCE AGAIN MEAN THAT YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN PLAY AND EQUIP IT TO A CREATURE
GHtkz9xBqfg_4 0 IT IS AN UNCOMMON AS WE SEE HERE FIRE SHRIEKER COSTS YOU THREE TO PUT IN PLAY AND TWO TO EQUIP WHICH MEANS IT COSTS YOU FIVE TOTAL TO EQUIP THIS FROM YOUR HAND TO A CREATURE
GHtkz9xBqfg_5 0 NOW WHAT THIS DOES IS IS IT ALLOWS YOUR CREATURE AND GIVES YOUR CREATURE DOUBLE STRIKE
GHtkz9xBqfg_6 0 WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT YOUR CREATURE DEALS DAMAGE TWICE
GHtkz9xBqfg_7 0 IT DEALS FIRST STRIKE DAMAGE AND COMBAT DAMAGE
GHtkz9xBqfg_8 0 SO YOUR TWO TWO IS NOW DOING FOUR COUNTS OF DAMAGE IT'S DOING TWO DAMAGE AS FIRST STRIKE DAMAGE SO IF IT DEALS DAMAGE TO A TWO TWO THAT DIES OR IF IT GOES UP AGAINST A FOUR FOUR IT WILL DEAL TWO TO FIRST STRIKE AND TWO DURING REGULAR COMBAT AND ESSENTIALLY KILL OUT THE FOUR FOUR AND REMEMBER THAT WHEN THAT CREATURE GOES TO A GRAVEYARD THAT THIS STAYS IN PLAY BECAUSE EQUIPMENT DOES NOT GO TO THE GRAVEYARD
GHtkz9xBqfg_9 0 IT JUST DETACHES ITSELF AND YOU CAN REEQUIP IT IT'S A VERY POWERFUL EQUIPMENT CARD
hegdgLllYu8_1 0 OKAY NOW I'VE STRUNG ONE HALF OF THE NECKLACE WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT DISK BEADS AND WE WANT TO GO AHEAD BECAUSE THIS IS A SIMPLE TYPE OF BEAD WE'RE GOING TO DO A CENTERPIECE
hegdgLllYu8_2 0 SO RIGHT NOW I'M AT THE HALF POINT OF AND READY TO GO AHEAD AND DESIGN MY CENTERPIECE
hegdgLllYu8_3 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS PROBABLY PUT A COUPLE SILVER BEADS ON EACH SIDE OF IT SO THAT IT CAN DANGLE NICE AND IT WON'T BE STUCK IN BETWEEN THE BEADS AND IT WILL HANG JUST RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF YOUR NECKLACE
hegdgLllYu8_4 0 THIS NEXT CLIP IS WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND STRING THE CENTERPIECE ON
hegdgLllYu8_5 0 I'M GOING TO STRING A SILVER BEAD FIRST AND THAT WILL GO THERE
hegdgLllYu8_6 0 I WILL GET A HEADPIN WITH ANOTHER SILVER BEAD ON THE BOTTOM HALF OF IT AND THEN THE LARGE BEAD AND THEN ANOTHER SILVER BEAD ON TOP SO IT LOOKS LIKE SO
hegdgLllYu8_7 0 WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS GET YOUR CUTTER AND LEAVE ABOUT A QUARTER INCH OFF THE END HERE TRIM IT AND THEN GET YOUR NEEDLE NOSE PLIERS THAT HAVE THE LITTLE ROUND TIP NOSE GET THE END HERE AND I CURL IT AND PUT THE END THAT'S HERE INTO THE SILVER BEAD
hegdgLllYu8_8 0 NOT COMPLETELY ALL THE WAY IN BUT TIGHT IN THERE SO THAT IT MAKES LIKE A LITTLE LOOP
hegdgLllYu8_9 0 YOU CAN SEE HOW I DID THAT
hegdgLllYu8_10 0 THEN I GRAB A HOLD OF IT HERE KIND OF LINE IT UP AND PUT IT IN THERE THEN IT WILL BE READY FOR YOUR NECKLACE
hegdgLllYu8_11 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S KIND OF TIGHT SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE STRING THREADING THROUGH
hegdgLllYu8_12 0 YOU CAN SEE THAT WHERE IT'S KIND OF IN THE SILVER BEAD
hegdgLllYu8_13 0 SO THEN WE GO AHEAD AND STRING IT TO THE CENTER OF YOUR NECKLACE
hegdgLllYu8_14 0 THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND HALF OF YOUR NECKLACE NOW

GSrbIEnbero_7 0 BE CAUTIOUS NOT TO USE ABRASIVE CLEANSERS
GSrbIEnbero_8 0 MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT CLEAN TOWELS AND A REALLY GOOD WINDOW SPRAY PREFERABLY ONE WITHOUT AMMONIA IN IT
GSrbIEnbero_9 0 WE LIKE TO USE A PROFESSIONAL SPRAY THAT WE GET FROM BUDDCO
GSrbIEnbero_10 0 BUT JUST COAT THE WINDOWS
GSrbIEnbero_11 0 IF YOU'VE GOT HARD WATER SPOTS WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT HOW TO GET RID OF THOSE BUT AGAIN YOU CAN USE A GOOD HARD WATER SPOT REMOVER THAT YOU CAN BUY PROFESSIONALLY
GSrbIEnbero_12 0 VINEGAR MIGHT ALSO WORK
GSrbIEnbero_13 0 AND THEN JUST GIVE THESE WINDOWS A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED CLEANING
GSrbIEnbero_14 0 WHAT I LIKE IS TWO-DIRECTIONAL CLEANING WITH CHANGING THE TOWEL FREQUENTLY
GSrbIEnbero_15 0 SO I'LL GO UP AND DOWN AND THEN I'LL GET A NEW SECTION OF THE TOWEL GO BACK AND FORTH MAKING SURE I GET RIGHT TO THE EDGES GOING IN AND OUT OF THEM

GSrbIEnbero_27 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FINAL FEW STEPS TO MAKE SURE THAT AS YOU'RE USING YOUR BOAT AND IN BETWEEN THE DETAILS HOW TO CARE FOR IT
H8KaDFVKl6g_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS DAVID O'DONNELL AND I'M HERE WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
H8KaDFVKl6g_2 0 AND IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO HANDLE THE BASIC RULES OF VENTRILOQUISM
H8KaDFVKl6g_3 0 NOW FIRST WHAT WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO SEIZE OUR LIPS AND OUR JAWS FROM MOVING WHATSOEVER
H8KaDFVKl6g_4 0 TO GIVE THE ILLUSION OF IMPERCEPTIBLE SPEECH THERE CAN BE NO MOVEMENT
H8KaDFVKl6g_5 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS MAKE THAT OUR FIRST RULE
H8KaDFVKl6g_6 0 WHEN WE'RE DOING VENTRILOQUISM THE JAW AND THE LIPS CANNOT MOVE WHATSOEVER AT ALL
H8KaDFVKl6g_7 0 OK NOW TO DO THAT WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO GO TO RULE NUMBER TWO WHICH IS TO KEEP OUR LIPS SLIGHTLY PARTED
H8KaDFVKl6g_8 0 WE'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO CLAMP SHUT
H8KaDFVKl6g_9 0 WE'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO HAVE ANY TENSION IN THE FACE OR NECK AREA
H8KaDFVKl6g_10 0 WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO KEEP RELAXED BUT KEEP THEM SLIGHTLY PARTED TOGETHER
H8KaDFVKl6g_11 0 OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T DO THAT WHILE WE'RE TALKING
H8KaDFVKl6g_12 0 THE THIRD RULE IS WE'RE GOING TO USE OUR TONGUE
H8KaDFVKl6g_13 0 WHILE WE USED TO USE OUR JAW AND LIPS TO CREATE THE MOVEMENT AND SOUND NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO THAT WITH OUR TONGUE WITHIN OUR MOUTHS THAT'S HIDDEN BEHIND OUR TEETH
H8KaDFVKl6g_14 0 THE NEXT POINT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FOLLOW IS TO CREATE A CONTRASTING VOICE FOR YOUR CHARACTER
H8KaDFVKl6g_15 0 YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO A LITTLE BIT HIGHER
H8KaDFVKl6g_16 0 YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN YOUR VOICE
H8KaDFVKl6g_17 0 IT'S UP TO YOU
H8KaDFVKl6g_18 0 THE NEXT THING WHEN YOU'RE DOING VENTRILOQUISM IS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A SYNCHRONIZED MOVEMENT
H8KaDFVKl6g_19 0 A VOICE OF YOUR CHARACTER WILL WANT TO FOLLOW THE MOUTHING OF THE PUPPET
H8KaDFVKl6g_20 0 YOU CAN'T JUST KIND OF SEND IT OFF ON ITS OWN
H8KaDFVKl6g_21 0 IT HAS TO ACTUALLY FOLLOW SOMETHING TO MAINTAIN THE ILLUSION
H8KaDFVKl6g_22 0 AND IT ALSO HAS TO HAVE THE ILLUSION OF BEING INDEPENDENT OF YOU AS WELL
H8KaDFVKl6g_23 0 EVEN IF PEOPLE KNOW IT IS PART OF YOU IT IS MY HAND BUT I'M CREATING AN ILLUSION HERE THAT THIS IS OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY

GBaqcqYkaLY_3 0 WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS MEASURING THE LAST POINT OF CUTTING
GBaqcqYkaLY_4 0 IF YOU CAN SEE YOU SEE THE DARKNESS OF THE LAST PIECE THERE
GBaqcqYkaLY_5 0 I WANT YOU TO NOTICE THAT
GBaqcqYkaLY_6 0 I'M GOING TO BRING IT UP A LITTLE BIT LIKE THAT SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE MY FINGERS ARE AND HOW IT'S KIND OF THINNER THERE
GBaqcqYkaLY_7 0 THE POINT THAT I JUST CUT IS HERE AND THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO FOLLOW
GBaqcqYkaLY_8 0 YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THAT GUIDE
GBaqcqYkaLY_9 0 IT'S CALLED A GUIDE
GBaqcqYkaLY_10 0 WE GO STRAIGHT ACROSS
GBaqcqYkaLY_12 0 FOLLOWING THE SAME GUIDE
GBaqcqYkaLY_13 0 YOU WANT TO FOLLOW THE GUIDE
GBaqcqYkaLY_14 0 IT IS IMPORTANT TO DO THAT OR ELSE YOU'LL JUST LOSE WHAT YOU'RE DOING
GBaqcqYkaLY_15 0 HERE WE GO
GBaqcqYkaLY_16 0 WE'RE JUST GOING ACROSS LIKE THAT
GBaqcqYkaLY_17 0 DOWN AND LOOKING AT HER HAIR
GQkOdxXblg8_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE WANT TO COVER SOME OF THE FINER POINTS OF WALKING WITH SNOWSHOES ON IN THE BACK COUNTRY
GQkOdxXblg8_2 0 YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO PICK A PAIR OF SHOES OF COURSE THAT IS COMFORTABLE FOR YOU AND IS EASY FOR YOU TO MANEUVER IN
GQkOdxXblg8_3 0 WHEN YOU ARE WALKING CROSS COUNTRY YOU REALLY WANT TO AVOID ANY VISUAL OBSTACLES YOU CAN SEE BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES THERE WILL BE EMPTY AREAS BELOW THE SNOW THAT YOU WILL FALL THROUGH AND THERE IS A RISK OF INJURY
GQkOdxXblg8_4 0 YOU USUALLY FIND THOSE NEAR ROCKS NEAR TREES ANY PLACE WHERE THERE IS SOMETHING THAT CAN DISRUPT THE SNOW ALSO OVER WATER SO CERTAINLY IF YOU HEAR WATER DON'T WALK ANY WHERE NEAR IT
GQkOdxXblg8_5 0 IT IS ALSO A VERY GOOD IDEA TO USE SOME KIND OF POLES LIKE A SKI POLE WHEN YOU ARE WALKING ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE IN DEEP POWDER IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET UP ONCE YOU HAVE FALLEN
GQkOdxXblg8_6 0 THE POLES MAKE IT MUCH EASIER EITHER BY JUST BEING ABLE TO PULL YOURSELF UP WITH THEM OR IF NECESSARY TO LAY THEM ACROSS ONE ANOTHER TO USE AS A PLATFORM TO PUSH UP OFF OF
GQkOdxXblg8_7 0 ALSO WHEN YOU ARE TRAVELING ON UNEVEN TERRAIN YOU WANT TO GO DIRECTLY PERPENDICULAR TO THE HILLSIDE
GQkOdxXblg8_8 0 YOU WANT TO GO STRAIGHT DOWN THE HILL DON'T WALK AT AN ANGLE WHETHER YOU ARE GOING UP OR DOWN
GQkOdxXblg8_9 0 THE SHOES WORK MUCH BETTER STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN THAN THEY WILL AT AN ANGLE
GPDrutH2CHY_1 0 O'KAY SO WE DID ONE STEP SPARRING EPO KUMATA WE DID THREE STEP SPARRING SONBON KUMATA AND NOW WE ARE DOING GIO KUMATA WHICH KUMATA BASICALLY MEANS CROSSING HANDS OR MEETING HANDS AND IT IS WHAT THE JAPANESE MEANS SPARRING
GPDrutH2CHY_2 0 SPARRING IS WHERE THERE IS NO PREARRANGED TARGETS
GPDrutH2CHY_3 0 IT IS BASICALLY LIKE PUTTING ON THE GLOVES AND GOING AT IT
GPDrutH2CHY_4 0 THERE ARE RULES AND YOU ARE NOT TRYING TO KNOCK YOUR OPPONENT OUT
GPDrutH2CHY_5 0 YOU ARE WORKING ON YOUR DISTANCING YOUR MAHI
GPDrutH2CHY_6 0 YOU ARE WORKING ON YOUR TSUBAKI
GPDrutH2CHY_7 0 YOU ARE WORKING ON TIMING AND IF ANYTHING ITS TIMING
GPDrutH2CHY_8 0 THE ONE THING THAT BEGINNERS HAVE TROUBLE WITH IT IS TIMING
GPDrutH2CHY_9 0 AS YOU PROGRESS YOU GET A FEEL FOR IT
GPDrutH2CHY_10 0 IT IS ONE OF THOSE SUBCONSCIOUS THINGS THAT YOU WILL JUST LEARN
GPDrutH2CHY_11 0 YOU STAND AND BOW AND YOU ASSUME YOUR COMATA OR YOUR FIGHTING POSTURE
GPDrutH2CHY_12 0 NOW SHAWN IS JUST GOING TO THROW HANDS AND I AM GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING
GPDrutH2CHY_13 0 WE ARE GOING TO WORK NICE AND SLOW AND DEMONSTRATE WHAT I AM DOING
GPDrutH2CHY_14 0 I AM WATCHING THE TOP OF HIS CHEST I'M NOT REALLY LOOKING IN HIS EYES BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES THEY CAN FAKE YOU OUT AND TRY TO LOOK LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO HIT YOU SOMEWHERE
GPDrutH2CHY_15 0 HE'S A BIG GUY AND I DON'T WANT TO GET PSYCHED OUT
GPDrutH2CHY_16 0 I CAN SEE HERE WHENEVER HE IS MOVING HIS HANDS
GPDrutH2CHY_17 0 I CAN SEE WHEN HE IS GOING TO DECIDE TO KICK
GPDrutH2CHY_18 0 I CAN LOOK RIGHT THERE AND SEE HIM SHIFT HIS HIP
GPDrutH2CHY_19 0 IF YOU ARE FOCUSING THERE THEY CAN'T TELL WHERE YOU ARE LOOKING
GPDrutH2CHY_20 0 HE DID NOT SEE THAT KICK
GPDrutH2CHY_21 0 I MAINTAIN THE SAME LEVEL
GPDrutH2CHY_22 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO WORK ON YOUR DISTANCING TOO
GPDrutH2CHY_23 0 YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO HIT FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE
GPDrutH2CHY_24 0 YOU DON'T ALWAYS WANT TO GO IN STRAIGHT BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH
GPDrutH2CHY_25 0 IF SOMEBODY HAS A SUPERIOR REACH AND HE THROWS A PUNCH EVENTUALLY HE IS GOING TO CATCH YOU
GPDrutH2CHY_26 0 IF YOU STAY THERE AND TRY TO BLOCK IT COMES BACK
GPDrutH2CHY_27 0 IF YOU ARE USING TSUBAKI AND HE IS THROWING THESE PUNCHES WILLIE NILLIE YOU'VE GOT HIM ON DISTANCE
GPDrutH2CHY_28 0 ALSO IF YOU ARE IN THIS CLOSE SOMETHING THAT YOU MAY LET YOU DO IN MORE PRACTICAL SPARRING THEY MAY LET YOU USE ELBOWS CONTROLLED THOUGH YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO USE ELBOWS TO THE HEAD YOU CAN USE KNEES AND TAKE OUT LOW
GPDrutH2CHY_29 0 THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN DO IT
H5xLkTmh-YU_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHILE YOU ARE CLEANING IT AND PULLING OUT SOME OF THE FINE DEBRIS OUT OF THE SCREEN ENCLOSURE YOU MAY NOTICE THAT SOME OF THE LITTLE PIECES FALL DOWN BELOW
H5xLkTmh-YU_2 0 THAT IS OKAY
H5xLkTmh-YU_3 0 SOMETIMES IF THERE IS A JUST A LITTLE BIT OF PINE NEEDLES JUST STICKING THROUGH I MIGHT PUSH IT THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN I'M DONE WITH THIS JOB OF CLEANING THE SCREEN ENCLOSURE I HAVE TO CLEAN THE POOL
H5xLkTmh-YU_4 0 ALSO THE POOL DECK
H5xLkTmh-YU_5 0 ALSO AT THIS TIME IT IS A VERY GOOD IDEA TO INSPECT YOUR SCREEN ENCLOSURE FOR ANY RIPS AND TEARS IN ANY OF THE SCREENS TO HAVE THOSE REPAIRED AS WELL
H5xLkTmh-YU_6 0 SO WHILE YOU ARE UP HERE DOING THE FINE TUNING AND CLEANING THIS AREA HERE IS VERY CLEAN
H5xLkTmh-YU_7 0 I DON'T SEE ANY TEARS
H5xLkTmh-YU_8 0 WHENEVER BRANCHES LAND ON THIS SCREEN ENCLOSURE I KNOW THAT THERE IS A BRANCH ON THAT SECTION SO WE HAVE TO KEEP A WATCHFUL EYE OUT FOR ANY TEARS OR ANY REPAIRS THAT MIGHT NEED TO BE DONE TO THE POOL ENCLOSURE
G5ZzLdUbWKU_1 0 NOW ALONG WITH THE TRIPLE THREAT OFFENSE YOU ALSO HAVE TO BE AWARE OF DEFENSE
G5ZzLdUbWKU_2 0 DEFENSE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS THERE IS NO LIE ABOUT THAT
G5ZzLdUbWKU_3 0 NOW AN IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS YOUR STANCE IN DEFENSE
G5ZzLdUbWKU_4 0 YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE IN FRONT OF YOUR DEFENDER IN A CROUCH POSITION WAITING EVENLY DISTRIBUTED ON THE BACK FOOT AS WELL ON THE FRONT ONE
G5ZzLdUbWKU_5 0 NOW YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO SLIDE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO SLIDE FORWARD YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO SLIDE BACKWARDS BUT IT'S GOT TO BE FLUID
G5ZzLdUbWKU_6 0 SO YOU WANT YOUR WEIGHT TO BE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED CAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO SIDE TO SIDE
G5ZzLdUbWKU_7 0 NOTICE THE HANDS ARE ALWAYS EXTENDED
G5ZzLdUbWKU_8 0 THIS WAY IF THE PASS IS MADE YOU CAN SWATTED IT DOWN OR CLOSE DOWN THE PASSING LANES
G5ZzLdUbWKU_9 0 HANDS CAN ALSO GO UP HIGH IF NEED TO OR DOWN LOW BUT IT'S A THREAT ALWAYS IN THAT TRIPLE THREAT POSITION SIMILAR TO THE OFFENSE
G5ZzLdUbWKU_10 0 WHAT THIS ALLOWS YOU TO DO IS TO COVER ALL ANGLES ALONG WITH YOUR TEAMMATES
G5ZzLdUbWKU_11 0 THAT'S UTILIZING TEAM DEFENSE AND ESSENTIALLY USING THE TRIPLE THREAT ON DEFENSE

GdacT1jPa6w_1 0 ALRIGHT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU NOW ABOUT ACTUALLY WHEN YOU ASK THE QUESTIONS TO THE PERSON YOU'RE INTERVIEWING
GdacT1jPa6w_2 0 WE'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THAT WE'D RATHER HAVE SOME OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS SO THAT THE ANSWERS CAN BE A DISCUSSION CAN COME OUT OF THE ANSWERS RATHER THAN JUST YES OR NO
GdacT1jPa6w_3 0 BUT SOMETHING THAT'S REAL IMPORTANT IS WHAT WE CALL NEUTRAL PHRASINGAND NEUTRAL PHRASING IS ASKING THE QUESTION IN SUCH A WAY THAT I DO NOT SENSE YOUR VIEW ON IT
GdacT1jPa6w_4 0 LIKE I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO MY QUESTION ABOUT IRAQ
GdacT1jPa6w_5 0 CLOSED WOULD HAVE BEEN SHOULD WE PULL THE TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ
GdacT1jPa6w_6 0 YES OR NO

GdacT1jPa6w_8 0 WELL THAT'S NEUTRAL PHRASING
GdacT1jPa6w_9 0 WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS SAY SOMETHING LIKE DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD PULL THE TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ
GdacT1jPa6w_10 0 BECAUSE WHAT THAT'S DOING IS LEADING
GdacT1jPa6w_11 0 YOU'VE HEARD OF LEADING THE WITNESS

gC--X1TycjY_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS TREVOR AND I WORK WITH MONSTER PEST CONTROL WE ARE LOCATED AT AMERICAN FORK UTAH
gC--X1TycjY_2 0 AND TODAY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO RID YOUR HOME OF INSECTS
gC--X1TycjY_3 0 THE FIRST TOPIC IS HOW TO CONTROL SCALE INSECTS ON OUTDOOR PLANTS
gC--X1TycjY_4 0 A COUPLE OF THE ITEMS THAT WE LIKE TO USE ON OUTDOOR PLANTS ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE DEALING WITH VEGETABLES AND YOUR GARDEN PLANTS IS VINEGAR AND WATER
gC--X1TycjY_5 0 MIX HALF AND HALF TOGETHER ON YOUR PLANTS AND ONCE YOU DO THAT YOU CHECK YOUR PLANTS THE BACK OF YOUR PLANTS TURNING THEM MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S NO INSECTS RUBBING THEM OFF
gC--X1TycjY_6 0 AND THEN SPRAYING THE BOTTOM OF YOUR PLANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY OF THE THAT THE MATERIAL HITS ALL THE PLANT BOTH UP AND DOWN
gC--X1TycjY_7 0 DOING THIS UP AND DOWN ON YOUR PLANT TO MAKE SURE CHECK YOUR PLANT TO SEE IF IT HAS ANY CRACKS ON IT AS WELL
gC--X1TycjY_8 0 AND IF IT DOES OR ANY MARKS OF INSECTS THAT HAVE EATEN THEM CHECK THOSE AS WELL
gC--X1TycjY_9 0 AND TREAT ALL OF THOSE PLANTS
gZAGaEYOf4k_2 0 I'M JK DOOLEY AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GICLEES TODAY AND IF YOU'RE A PHOTOGRAPHER ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT THIS PROCESS IS IT'S FUN TO PRINT PHOTOGRAPHS ON CANVAS AND ALSO ON REALLY HIGH QUALITY WATERCOLOR PAPER
gZAGaEYOf4k_3 0 IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
gZAGaEYOf4k_4 0 SO IF YOU HAVE THE EQUIPMENT OR YOU'RE WORKING WITH A PRINTER WHEN YOU'RE DOING YOUR GICLEES THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING AND YOU SHOULD PROBABLY ALREADY HAVE A DIGITAL FILE BECAUSE YOU'RE WORKING WITH A DIGITAL CAMERA MOST OF THE TIME BUT THIS WILL GIVE YOU AN IDEA
gZAGaEYOf4k_5 0 THIS IS A PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPER AND THIS IS AN IMAGE THAT I DID NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY
gZAGaEYOf4k_6 0 IT JUST CAME STRAIGHT OFF THE CAMERA AND THIS IS THE SAME IMAGE PRINTED ON SOME WATERCOLOR PAPER AND THAT JUST KIND OF GIVES YOU AN IDEA
gZAGaEYOf4k_7 0 NONE OF THE SETTINGS WERE CHANGED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE DIFFERENT LOOKS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND YOU CAN REALLY HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH SOME PHOTOGRAPHY AND I'VE SEEN PEOPLE TAKE FAMILY PORTRAITS
gZAGaEYOf4k_8 0 I'VE DONE SCENERY SHOTS FOR PEOPLE AND BLOWN UP AN AVERAGE SIZE PHOTOGRAPH ONTO A THIRTY BY FORTY PIECE OF CANVAS AND ENHANCED IT AND IT LOOKS WONDERFUL
gZAGaEYOf4k_9 0 SO KEEP THAT IN MIND
gZAGaEYOf4k_10 0 THERE'S A LOT OF VERSATILITY TO THIS PROCESS AS WELL AND A LOT MORE WAYS FOR YOU TO PERHAPS MAKE A FEW MORE DOLLARS
GPrp5X7LNWE_1 0 SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO LEARN THE HARMONY PART TO MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB
GPrp5X7LNWE_2 0 AND JUST LIKE WE LEARNED THE HARMONY PART TO TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR EARLIER SO IF YOU HAVE A FRIEND THAT YOU'D LIKE TO PLAY THIS WITH OR IF YOU JUST WANT TO PLAY ON YOUR OWN THIS IS HOW IT GOES
GPrp5X7LNWE_3 0 SO IF YOU LIKE TO PLAY THE HARMONY PART THAT'S THE HARMONY PART TO MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB
GPrp5X7LNWE_4 0 AND NOW YOU KNOW TWO PIECES TO THIS
GPrp5X7LNWE_5 0 THE HARMONY PARTS AND THE FIRST VIOLIN PARTS TO THEM
GPrp5X7LNWE_6 0 THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER SHORT PIECES THAT YOU COULD LEARN THAT ALSO HAVE HARMONY PARTS SO THAT YOU COULD MAKE IT LEARNING TO PLAY THE VIOLIN A FUN EXPERIENCE FOR YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
g6g2uDg6Qgw_1 0 AS WE JUST DISCUSSED THE FOURTH NOTE OF A MAJOR SCALE IN THUS THE DISTANCE FROM THE FIRST NOTE OF A MAJOR SCALE TO THE FOURTH NOTE OF A MAJOR SCALE YOU WOULD REFER TO THAT INTERVAL AS A PERFECT FOURTH RATHER THAN A MAJOR FOURTH
g6g2uDg6Qgw_2 0 LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THAT ON THE GUITAR IF WE START FROM THE G TO THE SECOND NOTE OF THE MAJOR SCALE THIRD NOTE TO THE FOURTH NOTE
g6g2uDg6Qgw_3 0 THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE FIRST NOTE AND THE FOURTH NOTE WOULD BE CALLED A PERFECT FOURTH
g6g2uDg6Qgw_4 0 NOW NOTICE THAT THERE IS NO DIMINISHED FOURTH OR MINOR FOURTH BECAUSE THIS NOTE IS THE SAME AS THE THIRD NOTE FOR THE MAJOR SCALE SINCE THERE'S ONLY A HALF STEP BETWEEN THE THIRD NOTE AND THE FOURTH NOTE OF A MAJOR SCALE
g6g2uDg6Qgw_5 0 YOU WOULD ALMOST ALWAYS REFER TO THIS NOTE AS A THIRD AND ALMOST NEVER REFER TO IT AS A DIMINISHED FOURTH
g6g2uDg6Qgw_6 0 SO INSTEAD WE'VE JUST GOT ONE TWO THREE FOUR AND THEN WHEN YOU GET TO FIVE YOU HAVE A DIMINISHED FIVE BUT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS INTERVAL SHAPE
g6g2uDg6Qgw_7 0 YOU'VE GOT DOWN ONE STRING SAME FRET
g6g2uDg6Qgw_8 0 IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE SHAPE 4/4 PERFECT FOURTH EXCEPT WHEN YOU GET TO THAT B STRING
g6g2uDg6Qgw_9 0 YOU GOT TO RAISE THAT UP BY ONE FRET
geseEurhJQ8_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LEFT HAND GRIP AND HOW MANY KNUCKLES YOU COULD SEE AT ADDRESS
geseEurhJQ8_2 0 THERE'S A SAYING THAT THE NUMBER ONE IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD IS FOOD
geseEurhJQ8_3 0 NUMBER TWO IS WATER AND NUMBER THREE THE POSITION OF THE LEFT HAND GRIP
geseEurhJQ8_4 0 YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THE INFLUENCE OF THE LEFT HAND GRIP ON THE CLUB AND THIS IS WHY
geseEurhJQ8_5 0 BECAUSE SINCE YOU'RE A RIGHTY YOUR RIGHT HAND RIGHT ARM AND RIGHT SIDE IS GOING TO DO SO MUCH
geseEurhJQ8_6 0 IT'S GOING TO DO SO MUCH YOUR RIGHT SIDE
geseEurhJQ8_7 0 YOUR LEFT SIDE YOUR WEAKER SIDE AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WEAKER IF YOU'RE A RIGHT HANDER TRY THROWING A BALL LEFTY SEE HOW FAR IT GOES
geseEurhJQ8_8 0 IT'S A LOT WEAKER
geseEurhJQ8_9 0 YOU AT LEAST HAVE TO START IT OUT IN A POSITION WHERE IT'S NATURAL AND THAT MIGHT BE IN THE SAME POSITION AS YOUR ARM HANGS
geseEurhJQ8_10 0 YOUR ARM MIGHT HANG LIKE THIS WHERE YOU SEE FOUR KNUCKLES IT MIGHT HANG A LITTLE MORE LIKE THIS OR LIKE THIS
geseEurhJQ8_11 0 IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LEFT HAND GRIP HOLD THE CLUB SO THAT YOU SEE ONE KNUCKLE AND USE YOUR SWING
geseEurhJQ8_12 0 THEN HOLD THE CLUB WITH TWO KNUCKLES AND HIT
geseEurhJQ8_13 0 THEN WITH THREE KNUCKLES
geseEurhJQ8_14 0 THEN WITH FOUR KNUCKLES
geseEurhJQ8_15 0 YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE BALL GOING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
geseEurhJQ8_16 0 EXPERIMENT WITH THAT LEFT HAND GRIP
geseEurhJQ8_17 0 THE LEFT HAND GRIP NEXT TO FOOD AND WATER IS POSSIBLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD
geseEurhJQ8_18 0 EXPERIMENT WITH THAT LEFT HAND GRIP
gHcCsvCSuI8_1 0 HI MY NAME'S JILL WEISS AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO THROW A SLOW PITCH SOFTBALL
gHcCsvCSuI8_2 0 FIRST THING YOU WANT TO CONSIDER IS JUST THE GRIP OF THE BALL
gHcCsvCSuI8_3 0 YOU KNOW MAYBE FIND THE THE SEAMS AND DEPENDING ON HOW BIG YOUR HANDS ARE YOU KNOW THE THUMB OF THE BALL OR THE THUMB ON ONE OF THE SEAMS AND THEN THREE AT LEAST THREE YOU KNOW OF YOUR FIRST FINGERS ON THE THE OUTSIDE OF THE SEAMS
gHcCsvCSuI8_4 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO PALM THE BALL
gHcCsvCSuI8_5 0 YOU WANT TO HAVE IT COMFORTABLY KIND OF LOOSE AND THE ARC ON A SLOW PITCH IS YOU KNOW SIX TO TEN FEET AND YOU KNOW THE OBJECT OF THE YOU KNOW SLOW PITCH IS JUST YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT YOU PUT IT IN A POSITION WHERE THESE BATTERS YOU KNOW A THEY'RE YOU KNOW JUST GROUND-OUTS OR B POP IT UP OR C YOU KNOW YOU KNOW STRIKE OUTS
gHcCsvCSuI8_6 0 YOU KNOW USIN USIN THAT FRONT FOOT TO PUSH OFF THE MOUND THAT'S GOING TO HELP YOU YOU KNOW WITH THAT ARC
gHcCsvCSuI8_7 0 AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR YOUR BODY BOTH YOUR HIPS EVEN WITH HOME PLATE AND FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE WITH THE HANDS
gHcCsvCSuI8_8 0 MY NAME'S JILL WEISS AND THOSE ARE JUST SOME TIPS ON HOW TO THROW A SO SLOW PITCH SOFTBALL
GVL2P2xm04k_1 0 THE FIRST STEP TO DIRECTING A LOCAL PAGEANT IS GETTING THE AGE GROUP THAT YOU WANNA DO
GVL2P2xm04k_2 0 NOW YOU CAN EITHER HAVE AN ASSORTMENT OF AGE GROUPS OR YOU CAN FOCUS ON ONE AGE GROUP THAT IS UP TO YOU AS A PAGEANT DIRECTOR
GVL2P2xm04k_3 0 IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO MULTIPLE AGE GROUPS YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER THE CATEGORIES OF THE AGE GROUPS
GVL2P2xm04k_4 0 AND I'M GONNA HELP YOU BREAK THEM UP
GVL2P2xm04k_5 0 YOU CAN HAVE THEM ALL THE WAY FROM BABIES TO HIGH SCHOOL AGE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOCAL PAGEANT
GVL2P2xm04k_6 0 THIS IS EXCLUDING A FRANCHISE WHEN YOU GET INTO THE COLLEGE AGE CONTESTANTS
GVL2P2xm04k_7 0 SOME EXAMPLES OF SOME AGES BABY MISS ZERO TWO YEARS OLD TINY MISS THREE FIVE YEARS OLD LITTLE MISS SIX EIGHT AND ON UP TO JUNIOR MISS TEEN MISS AND MISS
GVL2P2xm04k_8 0 SO JUST CATEGORIZE THE AGES AS CLOSE TOGETHER AS YOU CAN SO THAT IT WILL BE MORE OF A FAIR COMPETITION TO ALL THE CONTESTANTS THAT THAT ENTER
gNt29GDAGlc_1 0 RICK TOBEY I'M RICK TOBEY AND IN THIS SERIES WE WILL BE LEARNING HOW TO PLAY BLUES PROGRESSIONS AND A BLUES SONG ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gNt29GDAGlc_2 0 NOW WHAT WE'VE LEARNED SO FAR WAS PLAYING AN E BLUES PROGRESSION WITH OPEN CHORDS THE E7 THE A AND THE B7
gNt29GDAGlc_3 0 THESE ARE OPEN MEANING THAT THERE ARE OPEN STRINGS IN THE CHORD
gNt29GDAGlc_4 0 BUT THERE IS ALSO A WAY TO PLAY IT WHERE THERE ARE NO OPEN STRINGS THESE ARE CALLED MOVABLE CHORDS OR BARRE CHORDSAND THE REASON IS THAT YOU CAN THEN CHANGE THE KEY
gNt29GDAGlc_5 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY LITTLE RED ROOSTER IN E YOU COULD PLAY IT OPEN
gNt29GDAGlc_6 0 BUT IF YOU WERE GOING TO PLAY LITTLE RED ROOSTER IN A DIFFERENT KEY LET'S SAY D YOU MIGHT WANT TO PLAY IT WITH THE BARRE CHORD
gNt29GDAGlc_7 0 SO THESE CHORDS ARE GOOD BECAUSE YOU CAN PLAY ANY SONG IN ANY KEY
gNt29GDAGlc_8 0 AND IN THE NEXT LESSON WE'LL LEARN HOW TO PLAY THESE SPECIFIC CHORDS THE E THE A AND THE B AS A MOVABLE OR A BARRE CHORD
hK0nsZ0vWX0_1 0 SWIMMING OVER A STRAINER AND DEALING WITH STRAINERS WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR BOAT IS A VERY DANGEROUS THING TO DO
hK0nsZ0vWX0_2 0 AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE DEMONSTRATING THAT TODAY
hK0nsZ0vWX0_3 0 HOWEVER WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING A LITTLE BIT OF THEORY ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT IF UNFORTUNATELY YOU DO COME UP IN THAT SITUATION
hK0nsZ0vWX0_4 0 STRAINERS ARE WHEN TREES HAVE FALLEN INTO THE RIVER AND YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF WATER GOING PAST THEM
hK0nsZ0vWX0_5 0 JUST LIKE SOMETHING YOU'RE GOING TO STRAIN OUT PASTA WITH THE LARGE OBJECTS GET STUCK AND THE WATER FLOWS THROUGH
hK0nsZ0vWX0_6 0 THIS IS WHY THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS THING WHEN YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR BOAT
hK0nsZ0vWX0_7 0 THE FIRST THING THAT YOU SHOULD TRY AND DO IS SWIM AS AGGRESSIVELY AS YOU CAN AROUND THE STRAINER TO AVOID IT FIRST AND FOREMOST
hK0nsZ0vWX0_8 0 HOWEVER IF YOU CAN'T AVOID IT THEN YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT SEEMS A LITTLE STRANGE
hK0nsZ0vWX0_9 0 GET ON YOUR BELLY AND SWIM AS AGGRESSIVELY AS YOU CAN TOWARD THE STRAINER
hK0nsZ0vWX0_10 0 AT WHICH POINT WHEN YOU GET CLOSE TO IT REACH UP GRAB THE STRAINER AND HAUL YOURSELF OVER SO THE STRAINER IS UNDER YOUR WAIST
hK0nsZ0vWX0_11 0 AT THIS POINT WHEN YOU'VE GOT MOST OF YOUR CHEST OVER THE TREE YOU THEN WANT TO KICK OVER IT AND TRY TO GET PAST IT
hK0nsZ0vWX0_12 0 OR IF YOU'RE STABLE SIT AND WAIT FOR MORE ASSISTANCE
hK0nsZ0vWX0_13 0 WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T GO UNDER THE STRAINER AND DON'T PUSH PEOPLE DOWN IF THEY'RE CAUGHT ON A STRAINER BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LIMBS ARE STICKING BELOW THE SURFACE TO CATCH SOMEONE
HGTvZMJFiFc_1 0 I'M BEAU TIMKEN MASTER SAKE SOMMELIER
HGTvZMJFiFc_2 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DAIGINJO SAKE BUT MORE PARTICULAR I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW THIS BOTTLE GETS FROM SHIZOKA PREFECTURE TO YOU WHERE YOU LIVE WHEREVER YOU MIGHT BE
HGTvZMJFiFc_3 0 IT'S KIND OF AN INTERESTING JOURNEY
HGTvZMJFiFc_4 0 A BREWER WILL FERMENT SAKE FOR THIRTY TO SIXTY SORRY THIRTY TO FORTY DAYS
HGTvZMJFiFc_5 0 AND THEN WHAT THEY'LL DO IS THEY'LL ALLOW IT TO REST TO SIT FROM SIX MONTHS TO ABOUT A YEAR
HGTvZMJFiFc_6 0 THIS IS WHERE IT GETS EXCITING
HGTvZMJFiFc_7 0 ONCE THEY PASTEURIZE IT FOR THE FINAL TIME THEY PACKAGE IT THEY BOTTLE IT AND THEY SHIP IT OUT
HGTvZMJFiFc_8 0 ON THE DATE OF EACH BOTTLE YOU'LL HAVE A BOTTLING DATE
HGTvZMJFiFc_9 0 SO WHAT HAPPENS THEN IS MOST OF THE BREWS GO TO YOKOHAMA PREFECTURE WHERE THEY HAVE MAJOR SHIPPING AREAS
HGTvZMJFiFc_10 0 AND THEY GET LOADED ON A CARGO SHIP AND THIS SHIP GOES FOR THIRTY DAYS ACROSS THE OCEAN AND ENDS UP IN EITHER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR OAKLAND CALIFORNIA OR AND I WOULD SAY THAT WAS ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF ALL SAKES IMPORTED IN TO THE UNITED STATES END UP THERE OR THEY TAKE THE LONG BOAT TO CHINA AND THEY GO DOWN TO THE PANAMA CANAL UP TO THE EAST COAST TO NEW JERSEY
HGTvZMJFiFc_11 0 SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY DAYS TRAVELING ON THE HIGH SEAS
HGTvZMJFiFc_12 0 THEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT QUARANTINE WHERE THEY GO IN TO SHIPPING
HGTvZMJFiFc_13 0 AND WHAT I LIKE TO SAY IS IT NOW BY THE TIME YOU TASTE THE SAKE FROM ARRIVAL TO YOUR WINE SHOP OR TO YOUR RESTAURANT IT MAY BE ANOTHER THIRTY DAYS
HGTvZMJFiFc_14 0 SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT SIXTY DAYS FROM JAPAN TO GET TO YOU LOCALLY
HGTvZMJFiFc_15 0 AND I THINK THAT'S A PHENOMENAL THING
HGTvZMJFiFc_16 0 YOUR SAKES ARE INCREDIBLE FRESH TODAY AND THAT WASN'T ALWAYS THE CASE
HGTvZMJFiFc_17 0 SAKE USED TO TAKE A YEAR TO FINALLY GET TO ITS FINAL DESTINATION AND THIS IS SAKE THAT'S PROBABLY PRETTY DAMAGED TO BEGIN WITH
HGTvZMJFiFc_18 0 SO THERE'S BEEN SUCH A GREAT DEMAND IN THE WEST THEY'VE REALLY SPED UP THE PROCESS OF GETTING A BREW TO YOU
HGTvZMJFiFc_19 0 AND I THINK WE REAP THE BENEFITS BECAUSE WE'RE DRINKING FAR BETTER FAR FRESHER FAR MORE DRINKABLE SAKE
HFA_4HkuXqc_1 0 WHEN CARING FOR A HORSE IN A STABLE IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR STALLS STAY CLEAN AND DRY
HFA_4HkuXqc_2 0 WE DO THIS BY MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE CLEANED MUCKED OUT AT LEAST ONCE DAILY AND THAT FRESH SAW DUST IS PUT IN
HFA_4HkuXqc_3 0 WE ALSO LIKE TO KEEP RUBBER MATS WHICH HELP TO MAKE THE CLEANING PROCESS EASIER AND PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT FOR THE HORSE
HFA_4HkuXqc_4 0 IT'S ALSO AN OPTION TO HAVE A STALL GUARD SO THAT YOUR HORSE IS ABLE TO STICK IT'S HEAD OUT AND THE VENTILATION IS IMPROVED
HFA_4HkuXqc_5 0 WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE JUST LIKE WITH ANY CARE OF THE HORSE THAT THERE'S FRESH WATER AND FOOD AVAILABLE THROUGH OUT THE COURSE OF THE DAY
HFA_4HkuXqc_6 0 HAY AND GRAIN ARE USUALLY FED WHEN A HORSE IS STABLED
h40qZA6CO14_1 0 LET'S TALK NOW ABOUT HOW TO DETERMINE WHERE YOUR JIG IS IN RELATION TO THE WATER COLUMN AND THE BOTTOM OF THE LAKE OR POND AND THE ICE
h40qZA6CO14_2 0 YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW THAT
h40qZA6CO14_3 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO BE FISHING BLIND AND RUN INTO A SCHOOL OF FISH SAY THAT ARE TEN FEET BELOW THE ICE
h40qZA6CO14_4 0 AND THEN YOU CATCH ONE AND THEN YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE YOU WERE AND SO YOU MISS THE ENTIRE SCHOOL WHILE THEY'RE THERE
h40qZA6CO14_5 0 SO THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FISH FINDER SIMPLY TO TAKE YOUR JIG AND DROP IT DOWN THE HOLE
h40qZA6CO14_6 0 LET THE LINE GO FREELY KEEP THE BALE OPEN LET THE SPOOL GO UNTIL THAT LURE STOPS
h40qZA6CO14_7 0 AND SO THERE WE GO
h40qZA6CO14_8 0 THE LINE STOPPED BY ITSELF WHICH MEANS THAT THE JIG IS ON THE BOTTOM
h40qZA6CO14_9 0 WHAT I CAN DO NOW IS SIMPLY BRING IT UP A COUPLE FEET AT A TIME AND I'LL KNOW NOW O.K
h40qZA6CO14_10 0 I'M ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF TO TWO FEET OFF THE BOTTOM
h40qZA6CO14_11 0 I CAN FISH THAT AREA FOR A FEW MINUTES
h40qZA6CO14_12 0 IF I CATCH A FISH I'LL KNOW IMMEDIATELY DROP IT BACK TO THE BOTTOM BRING IT UP A COUPLE OF FEET
h40qZA6CO14_13 0 ACCORDINGLY IF I'M NOT CATCHING FISH THERE I CAN BRING IT UP SAY ANOTHER FIVE TURNS OF THE REEL
h40qZA6CO14_14 0 NOW I'M SEVEN TURNS OF THE REEL OFF THE BOTTOM FISH THAT FOR A BIT
h40qZA6CO14_15 0 IF I CATCH FISH I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE FISH ARE

gScmbJido84_9 0 SOME PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE SHARING THINGS WITH OTHERS SOME PEOPLE NEED TO KEEP THINGS VERY PRIVATE
gScmbJido84_10 0 WHEN YOU HAVE A BOARD IN A SPOT WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE IT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE SHARING
gScmbJido84_11 0 THE BLESSING IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY PRIVATE FOR YOU
gScmbJido84_12 0 YOU CAN BLESS IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE
gScmbJido84_13 0 IF YOU LIVE WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE AND YOU WANT AGREEMENT ON WHAT YOU'RE CREATING HAVE A LITTLE BLESSING CEREMONY ON THE VISION BOARD SO THAT YOU HAVE PEOPLE SUPPORTING YOUR VISION WITH YOU
gScmbJido84_14 0 AND WHEN MORE PEOPLE COME TOGETHER TO PRAY IT'S VERY VERY POWERFUL

h4gguLkJmsg_9 0 YOU'LL PROBABLY BE SURPRISED THE CREATIVITY YOU'LL COME UP WITH IN THE END
h4gguLkJmsg_10 0 THE MAIN THING IS TO HAVE FUN WHILE SHOPPING
hbQigJ5VmFg_1 0 IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TOUCH MODE
hbQigJ5VmFg_2 0 NOW SAY YOU'VE WRITTEN IN YOUR AUTOMATION FOR YOUR DRAWING OR VIA FADER MOVEMENT AND YOU'VE DONE THAT VIA USING THE WRITE MODE
hbQigJ5VmFg_3 0 NOW TOUCH MODE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO START ALL OVER WITH WRITE AND START AT THE BEGINNING AND REDO EVERY AUTOMATION POINT YOU CAN TAKE TOUCH AND START WHERE EVER YOU LIKE
hbQigJ5VmFg_4 0 START FROM THE BEGINNING THE MIDDLE OR THE END AND WHENEVER YOU TOUCH AND MOVE THE FADER THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE WHATEVER AUTOMATION YOU'VE ALREADY HAD WRITTEN
hbQigJ5VmFg_5 0 SO SAY YOU STOP USING TOUCH MODE YOU JUST MOVE IT TO FIX ONE LITTLE PART IT WILL CONTINUE ON READING WHAT YOU HAD ALREADY PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN IN THE AUTOMATION
hbQigJ5VmFg_6 0 SO THEREFORE IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE TWO SECONDS WITHIN THIRTY SECONDS YOU CAN DO THAT WITH TOUCH MODE
hbQigJ5VmFg_7 0 IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO JUST TAG ON CHANGE SOMETHING AND THEN IT'LL GO RIGHT BACK TO WHERE IT WAS

gJ4ArGWF3FA_6 0 AND HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S THE BATTERY
gJ4ArGWF3FA_7 0 WELL THIS DOESN'T HAVE A SCREEN SO IF IT DOESN'T TAKE A CHARGE AND IT DOESN'T HOOK UP PROPERLY YOU'RE NOT GETTING A READING WHEN YOU PLUG IT INTO YOUR ITUNES OR TO YOUR USB PORT MOST OFTEN IT'S GOING TO BE A BATTERY ISSUE
gJ4ArGWF3FA_8 0 NOW LIKE ALL IPODS THERE ARE NO USER SERVICEABLE OR REPLACEMENT PARTS IN IT AT ALL
gJ4ArGWF3FA_9 0 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
gJ4ArGWF3FA_10 0 DON'T TAKE IT APART DON'T ATTEMPT TO TAKE IT APART YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TAKE IT APART DON'T TAKE IT APART
gJ4ArGWF3FA_11 0 FIRST OF ALL UNLESS YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING IT VOIDS THE WARRANTY AND I FIGURE A LOT OF TIMES LET THE PROS DO WHAT THE PROS DO
gJ4ArGWF3FA_12 0 SO HOW DO YOU GET A REPLACEMENT BATTERY
gJ4ArGWF3FA_13 0 WELL IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO LIVE IN THE AREA WHERE YOU CAN JUST WALK IT BACK DOWN TO YOUR APPLE STORE WHERE YOU BOUGHT IT THEN GO AHEAD AND DO THAT
gJ4ArGWF3FA_14 0 AND IF IT'S WITHIN A YEAR THEY SHOULD JUST GO AHEAD AND REPLACE IT
gJ4ArGWF3FA_15 0 THE NICE THING IS IS THAT THEY'VE GOT IT AND THEY'RE READY TO DO IT THEY CAN JUST SIMPLY HAND YOU ANOTHER UNIT AND YOU'RE READY TO GO THEY SEND THAT ONE OFF TO BE REFURBISHED AND SOMEBODY ELSE CAN GET A HECK OF A DEAL ON IT DOWN THE ROAD
gJ4ArGWF3FA_16 0 IF YOU'VE GOT THE APPLE PRO-CARE PROTECTION PLAN YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND CALL THEM AT THE NUMBER OR VISIT THEM THROUGH THEIR INTERFACE AT APPLE.COM
gJ4ArGWF3FA_17 0 LET THEM KNOW THAT YOU THINK IT'S THE BATTERY THAT YOU WANT IT TO GO AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU THE INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO GET THIS BACK TO THEM SO THAT THEY CAN GET YOU- IN MOST CASES THEY'LL ACTUALLY JUST GIVE YOU A NEW UNIT AND THEN PUT THE BATTERY IN THIS ONE AND SEND IT TO LIKE I SAY SEND IT OFF AS A REFURB OR THINGS LIKE THAT
gJ4ArGWF3FA_18 0 EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T REPLACE THE BATTERY OR BUY THE BATTERY BY ITSELF IN ANY KIND OF MEANINGFUL OR EASY MANNER IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT APPLE DOESN'T TAKE CARE OF YOU
gJ4ArGWF3FA_19 0 SO GO AHEAD AND CONTACT THEM APPLE IS YOUR BEST BET TO GET THINGS DONE
gJ4ArGWF3FA_20 0 I'M ROKOSZ YOUR DIGITAL LIFESTYLE EXPERT SAYING STRING YOU LATER
GDfb-SAHV5I_1 0 SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT MAIDS USE ARE THE OBVIOUS THE VACUUMS THE MOPS THE CLEANING SUPPLIES THE DUST RAGS THINGS OF THAT NATURE BUT SOME TIMES THAT YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT WOULD BE A VEHICLE TO GET YOU THERE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY AS A MAID YOU ARE TRAVELING ALL OVER TO THE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS TO CLEAN SO YOU NEED A VEHICLE
GDfb-SAHV5I_2 0 ANOTHER VERY HELPFUL TOOL IS TO HAVE SOME SORT OF PLANNER WHETHER IT BE A WRITING UTENSIL AND A NOTEBOOK OR AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE I FIND THAT I HAVE AN IPHONE AND IT WORKS PERFECT BECAUSE I CAN STILL GET MY PHONE CALLS AND I HAVE GOT MY PLANNER BUILT IN SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU USE AS WELL
GDfb-SAHV5I_3 0 ALSO I RUN MY OWN BUSINESS AND I USE THE COMPUTER QUITE OFTEN TO RUN INVOICES KEEP TRACK OF SCHEDULES KEEP TRACK OF INVENTORY WHEN I NEED TO ORDER SUPPLIES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE
GDfb-SAHV5I_4 0 AGAIN YOU GO THROUGH LOTS OF SUPPLIES YOU GO THROUGH LOTS OF CLEANING SUPPLIES
GDfb-SAHV5I_5 0 WE USE A LOT OF HOMEMADE CLEANING SUPPLIES THINGS THAT WE PUT TOGETHER AND USE FOR GLASS CLEANER FOR INSTANCE I USE A MIXTURE OF VINEGAR DISH SOAP AND WATER AND I HAVE TRIED ALL SORTS OF GLASS CLEANERS AND NOTHING WORKS BETTER THAN THIS AND SO WE USE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE JUST OVER TIME TRIED AND TRIAL AND ERROR TYPE THINGS THAT WE HAVE FOUND THAT WORK THE BEST FOR CLEANING THAT MAYBE IS UNCONVENTIONAL AND SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE MAYBE DON'T THINK OF USING AND WE USE THAT FOR GENERAL CLEANING AS WELL COUNTER TOPS AND STAINLESS STEEL AND IT LEAVES A REALLY SPARKLING SHINE WITH NO STREAKS AND IT IS REALLY AWESOME
GDfb-SAHV5I_6 0 ALSO WE USE A LOT OF THE MICROFIBER TOWELS AND THE MICROFIBER FLOOR CLEANERS AND A LOT OF TIMES WE USE THOSE FLOOR CLEANERS FOR WALLS WHEN WE ARE WASHING WALLS BECAUSE THEY REACH HIGH AND THEY ARE THE MICROFIBER AND THEY DON'T SCRATCH THE WALLS SO YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF MULTI-USE CERTAIN TOOLS LIKE THAT
GDfb-SAHV5I_7 0 YOU CAN ALSO YOUR CEILING FANS YOU CAN USE THOSE TO WIPE DOWN THE CEILING FAN BLADES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE
GEWfNycYYoU_1 0 HI I'M JAMES WITH JNC HOME REPAIR
GEWfNycYYoU_2 0 TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO HIRE A SIDING CONTRACTOR
GEWfNycYYoU_3 0 FIRST THING TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE HIRING A SIDING CONTRACTOR IS I WOULD ASK AROUND MAYBE SOME FRIENDS OR FAMILY MAYBE WHO'VE HAD SOME WORK DONE HERE RECENTLY AND MAYBE THEY CAN GIVE YOU A GOOD REFERRAL OF SOMEBODY THAT HAS ACTUALLY COME OUT AND DONE SOME WORK FOR THEM
GEWfNycYYoU_4 0 THAT'LL BE THE BEST WAY TO FIND A GOOD SIDING CONTRACTOR
GEWfNycYYoU_5 0 YOU'RE LOOKING IN THE YELLOW PAGES YOU'RE LOOKING ON-LINE FOR SOMEBODY IT'S HIT OR MISS YOU MAY GET SOMEBODY GOOD YOU MAY GET SOMEBODY BAD YOU DON'T KNOW
GEWfNycYYoU_6 0 SO IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A REFERRAL AND EVEN IF YOU DO FIND SOMEBODY THAT YOU DON'T KNOW I WOULD DEFINITELY ASK FOR REFERENCES AND MAYBE PICTURES OF THEIR WORK
GEWfNycYYoU_7 0 ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME NEW SIDING INSTALLED AND YOU NEED A CONTRACTOR OUT THERE ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO CAULK AND PAINT IT AS WELL
GEWfNycYYoU_8 0 COMING OUT AND HAVING THE SIDING INSTALLED IS ONE THING BUT IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE CAULKED AND PAINTED IF YOU WANT IT TO LAST
GEWfNycYYoU_9 0 BECAUSE THE FIRST TIME IT RAINS OR ANY KIND OF MOISTURE GETS IN THERE ALL IT'S GOING TO DO IS JUST DO MORE DAMAGE
GEWfNycYYoU_10 0 SO YOU MAY WANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS HIRING SOMEBODY THAT CAN ACTUALLY DO THE SIDING THE PAINTING AND THE CAULKING ALL IN ONE SHOT AND THAT WAY YOU CAN JUST DEAL WITH ONE PERSON YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT CONTRACTORS AND FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE COMING OUT GIVING YOU ESTIMATES AND ALL THAT YOU CAN YOU KNOW KIND OF LIKE ONE STOP SHOPPING GET SOMEBODY OUT THERE THAT'S JUST GOING TO DO IT ALL AND THEY'LL USUALLY DO IT AT A CHEAPER PRICE

HBvszFuW7AE_20 0 OF COURSE IT IS ASKING US TO RESET THE COMPUTER BUT AS YOU'VE NOTICED THE TEST ON THE DESKTOP OVER HERE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY

GGNA5sjwwd0_3 0 THE POINT IS TO HAVE THE PLACE CLEANED IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO DO RENOVATIONS JUST MAKE SURE IT'S PROPER
GGNA5sjwwd0_4 0 AND THEN WHAT'S ALWAYS VERY HELPFUL THIS IS A ESPECIALLY FOR REALITORS IS LIGHT SOME FRAGRANT CANDLES BECAUSE THE ONE THING YOU DON'T WANT SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE CATS MAYBE THEY COOKED FISH THE NIGHT BEFORE OR MAYBE THERE'S JUST SOME SMELLS YOU RATHER NOT SMELL
GGNA5sjwwd0_5 0 SO ALWAYS LIGHT A SCENTED CANDLE WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS AN ADDED BONUS IS TO LIGHT SAGE IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO THE SAGE A LITTLE BEFORE HAND MAYBE THIRTY MINUTES BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU LIGHT IT THE SMELL SOME PEOPLE MISTAKE IT FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE OF SMELL IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
GGNA5sjwwd0_6 0 SO GO AROUND YOU CAN DO SAGE IN DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN ASK NEGATIVE AND ENERGY'S TO LEAVE THE HOUSE YOU CAN WALK AROUND AND SAY I WILL SELL THIS HOUSE TODAY BUT WHATEVER YOU DO MAKE IT FRAGRANT
GGNA5sjwwd0_7 0 GO IN ALL THE ROOMS AND IT'S ALWAYS A REALLY WONDERFUL IDEA IS TO HAVE SOME FLOWERS

gb-Rh-ezW3s_1 0 THE NEXT THING I WANT TO SHOW YOU IS LINEAR PHASE EQ
gb-Rh-ezW3s_2 0 IT'S ANOTHER TYPE OF EQ AND CAN BE FOUND IN YOUR PLUG-IN WINDOW IN YOUR EQ
gb-Rh-ezW3s_3 0 LINEAR PHASE EQ
gb-Rh-ezW3s_4 0 NOW WHEN LOOKING AT THIS EQ YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO SEE THE ACTUAL FREQUENCY RANGES BEING EFFECTED DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU DO
gb-Rh-ezW3s_5 0 DEPENDING ON WHERE I MOVE MY DOTS IT'S GOING TO CHANGE HOW MY SOUND IS BEING PLAYED
gb-Rh-ezW3s_6 0 I CAN ALSO DO SOMETHING LIKE TURN ON THE ANALYZER WHICH IS ACTUALLY GOING TO SHOW ME A REAL TIME EQ OF MY TRACK SO I CAN ACTUALLY DO THINGS AND SEE MY POST EQ AFTER I EFFECT IT
gb-Rh-ezW3s_7 0 SO IF I TAKE CERTAIN EFFECTS MAYBE CUT OUT A BASS TURN IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT I CAN ACTUALLY SEE HOW MY TRACK IS BEING EFFECTED BY HOW I'M CUTTING IT
gb-Rh-ezW3s_8 0 I CAN SEE THAT THE LOWS WITHIN MY TRACK ARE NOW BEING TURNED DOWN AND NOW THE HIGHS ARE JUST BEING LEFT TO PASS THROUGH

GdQu6LyRIlc_1 0 SO WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT KIND OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN PACK TWO WEEKS OUT AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT MOVING YOUR OFFICE AND PACKING UP YOUR OFFICE
GdQu6LyRIlc_2 0 SO THE FIRST THING THAT WE KIND OF TALKED ABOUT IN THE GENERAL TIPS SECTION IS TO GET RID OF THINGS THAT YOU'RE NOT USING OR THAT YOU DON'T NEED OR DON'T WORK AND THAT'S KIND OF A STANDARD FOR PACKING ANY ROOM OR PACKING ANYTHING
GdQu6LyRIlc_3 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO PACK THINGS THAT YOU DON'T NEED IT'S JUST EXTRA WEIGHT
GdQu6LyRIlc_4 0 SO SOMETHING THAT I CAN DO THIS IS WHERE I KEEP A LOT OF MY SUPPLIES THAT I USE EVERYDAY AND I CAN GO THROUGH THESE BASKETS AND TRY ALL THE PENS BECAUSE THE LAST TIME I DID THAT WAS A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WHEN I MOVED INTO THIS PLACE
GdQu6LyRIlc_5 0 SO I CAN TRY ALL THE PENS AND IF THEY'RE NOT WORKING THROW THEM OUT IF I DON'T WANT THEM OR IF I NEVER USE THEM THEN GIVE THEM AWAY DONATE THEM FIND A FRIEND THAT NEEDS THEM
GdQu6LyRIlc_6 0 AND DO THAT FOR ALL OF MY SUPPLIES HERE
GdQu6LyRIlc_7 0 AND THEN OF COURSE I HAVE OTHER PLACES WHERE I KEEP SUPPLIES THAT I'LL WANT TO DO THE SAME THING WITH
GdQu6LyRIlc_8 0 IN THIS BASKET HERE I KEEP SUPPLIES THAT I DON'T USE NECESSARILY ON A DAILY BASIS BUT I MIGHT FIND SOMETHING IN HERE THAT I JUST DON'T NEED ANYMORE OR THAT SOMETHING THAT BROKE AND I JUST STUCK IN THIS BASKET BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO PUT IT AND IT'S TIME TO GET RID OF THAT THING
GdQu6LyRIlc_9 0 SO I CAN PRETTY MUCH DO THAT FOR ALL OF THESE SPACES INCLUDING MY FILES AND MY PAPERS AND MY MATERIALS THAT I USE FOR PROJECTS
GdQu6LyRIlc_10 0 I MIGHT FIND MATERIALS THAT I USED FOR A PROJECT A YEAR AGO AND I DON'T NEED THEM ANYMORE I HAVEN'T USED THEM IN A YEAR SO I CAN GET RID OF THOSE SO I'M NOT HAVING TO PACK THEM
GdQu6LyRIlc_11 0 AND IN TERMS OF THE FILES AND YOUR PAPERS GOING THROUGH THOSE THINGS AND AGAIN JUST GETTING RID OF THINGS THAT YOU DON'T NEED ANYMORE

gAtGc8Cq7aE_7 0 OKAY SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND WE'VE GOT THE BOTTOM PIPE MOVED WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE OFF THIS WHOLE SECTION
gAtGc8Cq7aE_8 0 WE'VE ONLY GOT ONE MORE BOLT HOLDING IT ON AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THIS ONE SO WE'RE GOING TO USE A TWELVE MILLIMETER WITH OUR WRENCH AND TORQUE IT TO THE LEFT
gAtGc8Cq7aE_9 0 ALRIGHT YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE THAT OUT AND SET IT IN A NICE SAFE SPOT
gAtGc8Cq7aE_10 0 ALRIGHT SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND TAKE OFF OUR TAIL SECTION NOW
gAtGc8Cq7aE_11 0 WE'VE GOT IT ALL LOOSE
gAtGc8Cq7aE_12 0 THERE WE GO
gAtGc8Cq7aE_13 0 PULL IT ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE SIDE AND FIRST WE'RE GOING TO WIGGLE IT LOOSE
gAtGc8Cq7aE_14 0 WE DON'T WANT TO PULL IT TOO HARD AND BREAK ANYTHING
gAtGc8Cq7aE_15 0 THERE WE GO
gAtGc8Cq7aE_16 0 THAT'LL COME OFF JUST LIKE THAT
gAtGc8Cq7aE_17 0 AND THERE IS YOUR STOCK EXHAUST AND GO AHEAD AND SET THAT TO THE SIDE
h1UXt3b8nC4_1 0 THE TRADITIONAL ROUTE IS TO GO THROUGH FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE MAJORING IN EDUCATION AND WHEN YOU COME OUT YOU CAN TAKE SOME TESTS AND YOU'RE A CERTIFIED TEACHER
h1UXt3b8nC4_2 0 BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE NATION THAT TAKE ANYWHERE FROM TWELVE MONTHS TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS WHERE SOMEONE WHO HAS A COLLEGE DEGREE CAN GO AND GET THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THEY NEED TO BECOME A CERTIFIED TEACHER
h1UXt3b8nC4_3 0 WELL THE ONE I KNOW ABOUT IS REGION FOUR AT HOUSTON ISD IN HOUSTON TEXAS
h1UXt3b8nC4_4 0 AND IT'S AND EIGHTEEN MONTH PROGRAM THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY OF ST THOMAS AND YOU TAKE GRADUATE LEVEL COURSES THAT SEEM TO BE PRIMARILY IN ELEMENTARY AGED STUDENTS AND READING
h1UXt3b8nC4_5 0 AND THEN THERE WERE A LOT OF ADDITIONAL CLASSES ON CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT
h1UXt3b8nC4_6 0 AT THE END OF THAT EIGHTEEN MONTHS INCLUDING A YEAR OF WORKING IN THE CLASSROOM YOU WERE GIVEN A FULL TEACHER CERTIFICATION
h1UXt3b8nC4_7 0 I DON'T KNOW IF THEY STILL DO THAT BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND REQUIREMENTS
h1UXt3b8nC4_8 0 I DIDN'T GO THE TRADITIONAL WAY AND TAKE ALL THE EDUCATIONAL CLASSES THEY THINK ARE NECESSARY
h1UXt3b8nC4_9 0 I WOULD SAY IF YOU'RE AWARE OF WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU IN CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT AND WHAT WAS EFFECTIVE AND WHAT WAS NOT EFFECTIVE THAT IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN IN BEING ABLE TO CONTROL THE ATMOSPHERE OF YOUR CLASSROOM WHEN YOU BECOME A TEACHER
h1UXt3b8nC4_10 0 IF YOU KNOW WHAT WORKS FOR YOU AND YOU CAN SPECULATE AS TO WHAT WOULD WORK FOR OTHERS
h1UXt3b8nC4_11 0 I WAS A JOURNALIST BEFORE AND THE STUDENTS SEEM COMPLETELY ENAMORED WITH THE IDEA THAT MY NAME WAS IN PRINT AND PICTURES I'VE TAKEN ARE IN PAPERS
h1UXt3b8nC4_12 0 BUT I THINK ANYTHING YOU DO OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM YOU CAN BRING INTO THE CLASSROOM IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WE'RE TEACHING THE BASICS OF LIFE EVERY DAY IN THE ELEMENTARY AGE STUDENT
h1UXt3b8nC4_13 0 I THINK YOU NEED TO HAVE EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION SKILLS
h1UXt3b8nC4_14 0 YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH CHILDREN AND PARENTS ALIKE
h1UXt3b8nC4_15 0 YOU NEED TO LIKE CHILDREN AND THERE ARE ELEMENTARY TEACHERS WHO DO NOT AND THEY SHOULD MOVE ON
h1UXt3b8nC4_16 0 YOU NEED TO HAVE IMAGINATION AND CREATIVITY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE GIVEN ALL THE RESOURCES YOU NEED TO DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
h1UXt3b8nC4_17 0 AND YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN
h1UXt3b8nC4_18 0 SO IF THEY DON'T HAVE MANIPULATIVE'S YOU MIGHT BE USING DRY BEANS AND THOSE ARE MANIPULATIVE'S AND THAT'S FINE
h1UXt3b8nC4_19 0 SO YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A CURRICULUM AND MAKE IT REAL IN THE EYES OF AN EIGHT YEAR OLD
h1UXt3b8nC4_20 0 THERE ARE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADVANCEMENT FROM HERE
h1UXt3b8nC4_21 0 I'LL PROBABLY STAY A CLASSROOM TEACHER FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO
h1UXt3b8nC4_22 0 BUT YOU COULD BE A READING SPECIALIST A LITERACY LEADER
h1UXt3b8nC4_23 0 THEY HAVE MATH SPECIALISTS
h1UXt3b8nC4_24 0 YOU COULD MOVE INTO ADMINISTRATION
h1UXt3b8nC4_25 0 I'M TRYING TO THINK
h1UXt3b8nC4_26 0 WE HAVE TITLE ONE COORDINATORS THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE POSITION AT OUR SCHOOL
h1UXt3b8nC4_27 0 SO THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS TO MOVE UP AND STAY IN EDUCATION
gn4P8HdK_Ps_1 0 NOW I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO WEAVE IN THE COORDINATING COLOR
gn4P8HdK_Ps_2 0 YOU WANT TO SLIT AND WEAVE ONE SIDE OF THE SCARF BEFORE YOU DO THE OTHER SIDE SO THAT YOUR HOLES DON'T SHIFT WHILE YOU'RE WORKING ON ANOTHER SIDE
gn4P8HdK_Ps_3 0 I PREFER WHEN I START MY WEAVING I LIKE TO START IN THE MIDDLE BECAUSE THE STRIP IS SO LONG IT'LL BE A LITTLE BIT SHORTER IF WE START IN THE MIDDLE AND GO FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER END
gn4P8HdK_Ps_4 0 OKAY SO YOU FIND YOUR MIDDLE SLIT
gn4P8HdK_Ps_5 0 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXACTLY THE MIDDLE SLIT
gn4P8HdK_Ps_6 0 AND JUST YOU CAN POKE IT THROUGH WITH THE BLUNT END OF THE SCISSORS AND PULL THAT OUT TO ABOUT HALF WAY BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN JUST WEAVE IT IN AND OUT OF YOUR SLITS POKING THROUGH THE HOLES
gn4P8HdK_Ps_7 0 JUST UP AND DOWN WEAVING
gn4P8HdK_Ps_8 0 THIS IS A GREAT PROJECT TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN BECAUSE YOU CAN DO THE SET UP
gn4P8HdK_Ps_9 0 YOU CAN CUT THE SLITS AND THEN THE KIDS CAN HAVE FUN JUST WEAVING THE COORDINATING COLOR BACK AND FORTH
gn4P8HdK_Ps_10 0 AND JUST CONTINUE THIS ALL THE WAY DOWN THE END OF THE SCARF
gn4P8HdK_Ps_11 0 I FINISHED SLITTING AND WEAVING BOTH SIDES OF MY SCARF
gn4P8HdK_Ps_12 0 IF YOU FIND THAT YOUR SCARF IS A LITTLE PUCKERY YOU MAY WANT TO JUST ADJUST THE COORDINATING FABRIC
gn4P8HdK_Ps_13 0 JUST PULL IT BACK AND LOOSEN IT UP A LITTLE BIT SO YOU GET RID OF THAT PUCKERING
gn4P8HdK_Ps_15 0 AND NEXT I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO CUT AND TIE THE FRINGE ON THE END
gD2XxshZS_I_1 0 HI THIS IS TOM KENASTON
gD2XxshZS_I_2 0 I'M A PIANIST AND SINGER SONGWRITER LIVING IN WEST PALM BEACH FLORIDA AND NEW YORK CITY
gD2XxshZS_I_3 0 THIS CLIP IS GOING TO BE HOW TO LEARN TO PLAY CHOPSTICKS
gD2XxshZS_I_5 0 MANY OF YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW HOW BUT LET'S REVIEW
gD2XxshZS_I_6 0 MOST PEOPLE PLAY WITH TWO FIRST FINGERS SO WE'LL GO WITH THAT
gD2XxshZS_I_7 0 IF YOU LOOK AT THE PIANO YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR THE GROUPS OF THE BLACK KEYS FIRST
gD2XxshZS_I_8 0 THERE ARE GROUPS OF TWOS AND GROUPS OF THREES AND THAT'S IT
gD2XxshZS_I_9 0 SO IT GOES TWOS AND THREES AND TWOS AND THREES AND TWOS AND THREES AND TWOS
gD2XxshZS_I_10 0 MOST PEOPLE PLAY CHOPSTICKS IN THE KEY OF C WHICH STARTS HERE
gD2XxshZS_I_11 0 AND BY HERE I MEAN LOOK FOR THE GROUP OF THREE BLACK KEYS TAKE THE FIRST TWO AND SLIDE YOUR FINGERS DOWN AND OFF TO THE LEFT
gD2XxshZS_I_12 0 AND THERE ARE YOUR FIRST TWO KEYS FOR CHOPSTICKS
gD2XxshZS_I_13 0 WE START HERE AND YOU PLAY ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
gD2XxshZS_I_14 0 CHOPSTICKS IS IN THREE QUARTER TIME WHICH MEANS THREE BEATS
gD2XxshZS_I_15 0 ONE TWO THREE ONE TWO THREE
gD2XxshZS_I_16 0 THEN YOU MOVE THE LEFT FINGER DOWN HERE AND YOU'D GO ON WITH ONE TWO THREE ONE TWO THREE
gD2XxshZS_I_17 0 LEFT FINGER MOVES DOWN AGAIN ONE
gD2XxshZS_I_18 0 THIS TIME THE RIGHT FINGER SKIPS A NOTE AND GOES UP TO THE B
gD2XxshZS_I_19 0 NOW THINK OF THE TWO FINGERS AS GOING IN A MIRROR IMAGE OF EACH OTHER
gD2XxshZS_I_20 0 SO ONCE YOU'VE DONE THIS SKIP YOU JUST KEEP GOING
gD2XxshZS_I_21 0 THEY MIRROR EACH OTHER THAT'S A FUN WAY THING TO REMEMBER
gD2XxshZS_I_22 0 AND THEN IT REPEATS
gD2XxshZS_I_23 0 LEFT FINGER GOES DOWN ONE RIGHT FINGER GOES UP TWO
gD2XxshZS_I_24 0 JUMP TO THE CENTER AND BACK OUT
gD2XxshZS_I_25 0 AND THAT'S HOW YOU PLAY CHOPSTICKS
gD2XxshZS_I_26 0 THIS IS TOM KENASTON
gmZGoB4tyyQ_1 0 THESE PRINCESS SEAMS ARE ON A BELTED DRESS
gmZGoB4tyyQ_2 0 THE PRINCESS SEAMS AS WE'VE DISCUSSED MANY TIMES THEY SERVE A FUNCTION OF BRINGING IN THE GARMENT AT ITS MOST NARROW POINT WHICH IS YOUR WAIST AND THEN THEY FLARED OUT BASED ON THE HIPS AND THEN THEY COME BACK IN BASED ON HEMLINE
gmZGoB4tyyQ_3 0 SO THERE'S TWO WAYS OF SHOWING THAT IT'S GIVING TWO WAYS FOR THE BODY TO BE SHOWN AS IN LIKE A TYPICAL HOUR GLASS CUT IN SHAPE
gmZGoB4tyyQ_4 0 IT'S BASICALLY THE BELTED WAY IS JUST REINFORCING THAT THE BODY CURVES IN
gmZGoB4tyyQ_5 0 I HAVE HERE JUST A SIMPLE PRINCESSING SHIFT WITH A BELT AND I PUT THE BELT AT THE HIP POINT
gmZGoB4tyyQ_6 0 YOU COULD PUT IT UP HERE AT THE WAIST
gmZGoB4tyyQ_7 0 YOU COULD PUT IT ANYWHERE
gmZGoB4tyyQ_8 0 BUT THE WHOLE POINT OF IT IS THAT IT REINFORCES THE FACT THAT THE BODY'S GOING IN THERE
hcBNNxoA9lQ_1 0 ALRIGHT ONCE THE BEANS HAVE GOTTEN A CHANCE TO HEAT UP WE'LL WANT TO SCOOP THIS AND I'LL PUT IT IN THE CENTER OF THE PLATE AT FIRST BUT THEN I'M GOING TO MOVE IT AROUND TO THE EDGE
hcBNNxoA9lQ_2 0 NOW I'M DOING THIS FOR TWO REASONS
hcBNNxoA9lQ_3 0 ONE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THE RICE TO GET LOST
hcBNNxoA9lQ_4 0 I WANT IT TO KEEP IT'S OWN INDIVIDUAL FLAVOR BUT ALSO IT'S VERY COLORFUL
hcBNNxoA9lQ_5 0 SO I WANT THAT RICE TO BE NOTICED AS WELL AND THE SECOND REASON IS THAT WE'RE NICELY BUILDING A LITTLE DAM HERE BECAUSE OUR RAGU IS SO MOIST THAT I WANT THIS TO HOLD THE JUICE IN WITH THE PLATE
hcBNNxoA9lQ_6 0 SO I'M GOING TO COME IN NOW AND MAKE SURE THAT I SCOOP OUT SOME CHICKEN AND SOME CHORIZO AS WELL AS CARROTS AND TOMATOES AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF ALL ON TOP SO WE CAN SEE SOME CHORIZO SOME ORANGE FROM THE CARROTS SOME WHITE FROM THE CHICKEN AND THEN I WILL COME BACK WITH OUR JUICE AND POUR THAT OVER THE TOP AND SO HERE WE HAVE OUR CORN AND RED BEAN RICE WITH OUR CHICKEN AND SAUSAGE RAGU
GZVVFr2Bbcs_1 0 HI I'M TINA STULL AND I DRIVE THE TOP DRAGSTER FOR INTERSTATE BATTERIES
GZVVFr2Bbcs_2 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M HERE TO HELP YOU WALK THROUGH THE PROCESS OF FILLING OUT THE FORMS SO THAT YOU CAN COMPETE IN THE NHRA
GZVVFr2Bbcs_3 0 WHEN IT COMES TO AN APPLICATION THEY WANT IF YOU'RE A BRAND NEW BEGINNER AND YOU'VE NEVER RACED BEFORE
GZVVFr2Bbcs_4 0 YOU NEED TO GO THROUGH THE INITIAL LICENSING PROCESS
GZVVFr2Bbcs_5 0 YOU NEED MAKE SIX PASSES A MINIMUM OF SIX PASSES AT AN NHRA SANCTIONED TRACK
GZVVFr2Bbcs_6 0 IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT TRACKS ARE SANCTIONED YOU CAN GO ON NHRA.COM AND LOOK UP THEIR TRACKS AND SOME OF THE TRACKS ARE THE ONES WHERE WE HAVE NATIONAL EVENTS AND THERE LARGE TRACKS
GZVVFr2Bbcs_7 0 BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF SMALLER TRACKS AND EVEN SOME EIGHTH MILE TRACKS THAT ARE SANCTIONED
GZVVFr2Bbcs_8 0 SO THEY'LL ACCEPT THOSE TIMES OF SLIPS FROM THEM
GZVVFr2Bbcs_9 0 WHEN YOU'RE AT THE TRACK DOING YOUR PASS YOU DO BASICALLY A HALF PASS WHICH MEANS YOU JUST GO OUT
GZVVFr2Bbcs_10 0 THEY EXPECT IT TO BE SLOW
GZVVFr2Bbcs_11 0 IT'S KIND OF BASICALLY CAN YOU GET OFF THE LINE
GZVVFr2Bbcs_12 0 THEN YOU HAVE THREE MODERATE PASSES WHICH ARE BASICALLY PASSES WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO FULL SPEED ALL THE WAY TO THE FINISH LINE
GZVVFr2Bbcs_13 0 YOU DO GO FULL SPEED TO THE HALF TRACK MARK
GZVVFr2Bbcs_14 0 YOU'LL HAVE TWO FULL PASSES
GZVVFr2Bbcs_15 0 THOSE TWO FULL PASSES YOU'LL BE DRIVING YOUR CAR AT THE SPEED THAT YOU'LL BE COMPETING WITH WITHIN THOSE PARAMETERS
GZVVFr2Bbcs_16 0 ALL THAT CAN BE FOUND IN THE RULE BOOKS
GZVVFr2Bbcs_17 0 IT'S A LOT STRAIGHTER FORWARD THAN IT SOUNDS
GZVVFr2Bbcs_18 0 THOSE ARE JUST FULL PASSES WHERE YOU'RE DRIVING THE CAR ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE FINISH LINE
h8OIT0bLMi4_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS ORESTES GUADA FROM EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE GAME OF PAINTBALL
h8OIT0bLMi4_2 0 AIMING IS ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS IN PAINTBALL THE WAY TO AIM IS WITH THE FIRST FEW PAINTBALLS THAT YOU SHOOT YOU WOULD KNOW AND THEN WHEN YOU START RAPID FIRE YOU'LL KNOW WHERE YOUR STREAM IS GOING SO YOU CAN'T REALLY AIM WITH ONE SHOT LIKE THIS
h8OIT0bLMi4_3 0 JUST KEEP ONE SHOT YOU GOT TO LIKE SHOOT A LOT AND THEN YOU START GETTING THE FEEL WHERE YOUR PAINTBALLS ARE REALLY GOING
h8OIT0bLMi4_4 0 THE PAINTBALL GUNS THEY SHOT GREAT THEY SHOT REAL NICE AND IT DEPENDS ON THE BARREL IF YOU HAVE A GOOD BARREL IT'LL SHOT MORE ACCURATE OR NOT AND DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE PAINTBALL GUN AND EVERYTHING ON THE SIZE OF THE PAINT
h7Zz2ucfftU_1 0 HI TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO MANICURE SHORT NAILS
h7Zz2ucfftU_2 0 AND FIRST I WOULD START BY REMOVING THE POLISH
h7Zz2ucfftU_3 0 AND MAKE SURE YOU GET IT OFF ALL THESE SIDES
h7Zz2ucfftU_4 0 THEN WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE AND YOU'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND FILE YOUR NAILS
h7Zz2ucfftU_5 0 NOT MAKING SURE NOT TO GET DIG INTO THE SIDES
h7Zz2ucfftU_6 0 ONCE YOU FILED ALL YOUR NAILS YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SOAK THEM AND SCRUB THEM
h7Zz2ucfftU_7 0 TAKE THEM OUT AND DRY THEM
h7Zz2ucfftU_8 0 AND I ALWAYS TELL EVERYBODY AS YOU'RE DRYING YOUR NAILS IF YOU TAKE THAT TOWEL AND GENTLY PUSH THE CUTICLE BACK IT'LL SAVE YOU A LOT OF TROUBLE
h7Zz2ucfftU_9 0 YOU WON'T HAVE THAT SKIN GROWING ONTO THE NAIL
h7Zz2ucfftU_10 0 THEN NEXT USUALLY WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS APPLY SOME CUTICLE CREAM AND MASSAGE THAT IN
h7Zz2ucfftU_11 0 IF YOU MESSAGE THAT IN YOU'RE GOING TO STIMULATE THE CIRCULATION
h7Zz2ucfftU_12 0 WHICH IS GOING TO HELP TO PROMOTE THOSE NAILS TO GROW
h7Zz2ucfftU_13 0 AFTER YOU'VE MESSAGED THAT IN A LITTLE BIT I ALWAYS LIKE TO TAKE MY CUTICLE PUSHER AND GENTLY PUSH ANYTHING THAT YOU HAVE BACK MAKE SURE THERE'S NOTHING ON THE SKIN
h7Zz2ucfftU_14 0 AND THEN YOU WOULD GO AHEAD AND TAKE AND GO OVER ALL THEM AGAIN WITH SOME REMOVER TO MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOTTEN ANY TRACES OF ANY OILS OUT
h7Zz2ucfftU_15 0 START WITH A BASE COAT THAT IS RECOMMENDED FOR YOUR TYPE OF NAIL
h7Zz2ucfftU_16 0 IF IT'S A DRY NAIL USE A POLISH A BASE COAT DESIGNED FOR DRY NAILS
h7Zz2ucfftU_17 0 AND AT LEAST PUT ONE COAT OF POLISH ON AND A TOP COAT
h7Zz2ucfftU_18 0 AND THAT WOULD HELP TO PROMOTE YOU TO GROW NAILS
gNlvnXLfMKg_1 0 IN THIS SERIES WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SHELTERS AND THEIR PART IN ICE FISHING
gNlvnXLfMKg_2 0 SHELTERS ARE NOT JUST IMPORTANT TO KEEP YOU OUT OF THE MORE BRUTAL ELEMENTS OF WEATHER THAT YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER WHILE ICE FISHING BUT THEY ALSO PLAY A LARGE PART IN THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL ASPECTS OF IT
gNlvnXLfMKg_3 0 THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF SHELTERS AND THEY MAY BE USED ON DIFFERENT THICKNESSES OF ICE
gNlvnXLfMKg_4 0 RUDY WHY DON'T YOU SHOW US THE MOST RUDIMENTARY ABSOLUTELY SHELTER
gNlvnXLfMKg_5 0 ONE OF THE EASIEST MOST MOBILE SMALLEST AND VERY COMMON HERE IS THE THE SLED SHELTER
gNlvnXLfMKg_6 0 YOU PULL ALL OF YOUR EQUIPMENT OUT ON THE SLED YOU UNLOAD IT YOU SET YOUR PLANK UP AND THEN YOU CAN SIMPLY BACK INTO IT EASE YOURSELF DOWN AND GO TO FISHING
gNlvnXLfMKg_7 0 AND IT BLOCKS YOU FROM THE ELEMENTS AND THE WIND COMING AT YOU
gNlvnXLfMKg_8 0 IT KEEPS YOU OUT OF THAT BRUTAL NORTHERN WIND WHICH CAN CUT YOU
gNlvnXLfMKg_9 0 SO YOU WOULD BASICALLY JUST CUT YOUR HOLE RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF YOU ABSOLUTELY AND HAVE YOUR BUCKET OF BAIT OFF TO ONE SIDE AND JIG RIGHT OVER THE HOLE AND ALL THE TIME THE WIND IS AT YOUR BACK
gNlvnXLfMKg_10 0 IS THAT CORRECT
gNlvnXLfMKg_13 0 YEAH IT BLOCKS YOU FROM THE WIND
gNlvnXLfMKg_14 0 IT KIND OF CREATES THAT WRAP AROUND AND THE WIND GOES AROUND YOU AND IT CAN REALLY SAVE YOU TEN TO FIFTEEN DEGREES OF AIR TEMPERATURE
gNlvnXLfMKg_16 0 WELL THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
gNlvnXLfMKg_17 0 THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF ANY SHELTER IS TO CUT DOWN ON THE WIND BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT CAUSES THE CHILL THE WIND CHILL FACTOR TO DROP AS IT DOES
g4_J3PacBGg_1 0 NOW BEFORE WE PULL A TOILET WE'VE EMPTIED THE TANK FOR THE WATER
g4_J3PacBGg_2 0 THAT WAS EASY BUT WE NEED TO EMPTY THE BOWL OF THE WATER
g4_J3PacBGg_3 0 SO WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL POUR A BUCKET OF WATER HALF A BUCKET OF WATER IN THE TOILET AND WE'LL PULL IT KIND OF FAST AND THE NICE THING ABOUT THIS IS IT EMPTIED THE BOWL FOR US SO THERE'S VERY LITTLE WATER LEFT IN THERE
g4_J3PacBGg_4 0 SO WHEN WE PULL IT WE WON'T BE GETTING IT ALL OVER OURSELVES OKAY
g4_J3PacBGg_5 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REMOVE THE BOLTS
g4_J3PacBGg_6 0 TO REMOVE THE TOILET WE NEED TO UNDO THE BOLTS
g4_J3PacBGg_7 0 WE ALREADY UNDID THE SUPPLY LINE AND TURNED OFF THE WATER SO WE'RE OKAY THERE
g4_J3PacBGg_8 0 WE NEED TO GET THE CAP OFF
g4_J3PacBGg_9 0 THERE WE GO
g4_J3PacBGg_10 0 EXPOSE THE BOLT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A HALF INCH
g4_J3PacBGg_11 0 THERE WE GO A LITTLE BURR FROM THE PLUMBER THAT CUT THE BOLT OFF AND INSTALLED THIS
g4_J3PacBGg_12 0 HOPEFULLY THAT COMES OFF NICE AND NEAT WHICH IT DID
g4_J3PacBGg_13 0 THAT'S MY KIND OF PLUMBER
g4_J3PacBGg_14 0 REMOVE THE WASHERS WE DO THE OTHER SIDE
g4_J3PacBGg_15 0 WE'LL SEE HOW WELL THIS TOILET WAS GROUTED OR CAULKED TO THE FLOOR
g4_J3PacBGg_16 0 THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE AN ISSUE FOR US
g4_J3PacBGg_17 0 WE'LL WIGGLE A LITTLE LEFT AND WE'LL WIGGLE A LITTLE RIGHT AND IT'S GOING TO COME OFF JUST FINE
g4_J3PacBGg_18 0 OKAY WE YANK THE TOILET WE EXPOSE THE PLASTIC CLOSET FLANGE BECAUSE THIS IS A NEWER BUILDING
g4_J3PacBGg_19 0 WE SEE THE BOLTS ARE STILL INTACT AND THE FLANGE
g4_J3PacBGg_20 0 LIFE IS GOOD
g4_J3PacBGg_21 0 WE CHECK THE WAX RING TO SEE IF THERE'S BEEN ANY LEAKAGE ON THE WAX RING
g4_J3PacBGg_22 0 OKAY NOW EVERYTHING LOOKS FINE
g4_J3PacBGg_23 0 WE'RE GOING TO GO GET A STICK WE'RE GOING TO SCRAPE OFF SOME OF THE WAX RING PUT A NEW RING AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO REINSTALL THE TOILET
GXmTNL8rA7Q_1 0 REBECCA SATO HI
GXmTNL8rA7Q_2 0 I'M REBECCA WITH EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
GXmTNL8rA7Q_3 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO FIND OUT IF YOUR WRITING IS GOING TO BE MARKETABLE BEFORE YOU PUT IN A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY AND THERE'S A FEW WAYS TO DO THAT
GXmTNL8rA7Q_4 0 AND I'M NOT THERE'S NO WAY I CAN TELL YOU EVERY SINGLE WAY AND DIFFERENT AVENUES BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FOR EVERY TYPE OF WRITING AND WITH EVERY PUBLISHER
GXmTNL8rA7Q_5 0 BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO DO YOUR RESEARCH AND FIND OUT
GXmTNL8rA7Q_6 0 IF YOU HAVE A GREAT IDEA FOR A NOVEL AND MAYBE YOU'VE PUBLISHED SOME THINGS IN THE PAST MAYBE NOT A NOVEL BUT YOU HAVE OTHER WRITINGS SOME KIND OF CREDENTIALS SOMETIMES YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WRITE THE BOOK AT ALL BEFORE YOU CAN GET A CONTRACT
GXmTNL8rA7Q_7 0 YOU CAN JUST WRITE A PROPOSAL AND SAY THESE ARE MY CREDENTIALS THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO WRITE ABOUT AND THIS IS WHY I'D WRITE AN AWESOME BOOK
GXmTNL8rA7Q_8 0 SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET A CONTRACT JUST FROM THAT AND THEN OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO WRITE THE BOOK AND IT HAS TO BE GOOD
GXmTNL8rA7Q_9 0 BUT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THE HARDEST PART IS OUT OF THE WAY
GXmTNL8rA7Q_10 0 YOU'RE GETTING PAID FOR IT SO GO FOR IT
GXmTNL8rA7Q_11 0 SO THAT'S ONE WAY AND THEN THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO ENSURE THAT YOU DON'T PUT IN MORE TIME AND ENERGY THAN NECESSARY AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT NEXT
GmzjTbzZC30_1 0 DARREN STORR HI
GmzjTbzZC30_2 0 MY NAME IS DARREN STORR
GmzjTbzZC30_3 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M SHOWING YOU GUYS HOW TO RUN THE FOUR X 100 RELAY
GmzjTbzZC30_4 0 ALL RIGHT THIS IS MY TEAMMATE LOUIS YOUNG
GmzjTbzZC30_5 0 HE'S GOING TO HELP ME DEMONSTRATE SOME OF THE BATON RELAY EXCHANGES THROUGHOUT THE ZONES
GmzjTbzZC30_6 0 ALSO ANOTHER QUICK POINT TO MENTION IN THE FOUR X 100 IS THAT YOU HAVE TO GET THE BATON SAFELY AROUND THE TRACK WHICH IS A 400-METER LAP AND SOMETIMES THE LACK OF SPEED COMPENSATE FOR BASIC BATON EXCHANGES
GmzjTbzZC30_7 0 AS YOU KNOW THE WORLD RECORD IS HELD BY THE UNITED STATES 37.40 AND THIS IS ONE OF THE FASTEST TIMES IN THE WORLD
GmzjTbzZC30_8 0 ME AND LOUIS ARE GOING TO SHOW SOME OF THE EXCHANGE POINTS EXCHANGE ZONES SOME OF THE HAND-OFFS
GmzjTbzZC30_9 0 THE RUNNER ONE RUNNER ON THE FIRST LEG HE HAS TWENTY METERS WHICH IS THE YELLOW LINES TO EXCHANGE BATONS TO THE SECOND RUNNER
GmzjTbzZC30_10 0 SO HE WANT TO HAVE LOUIS HE'S COMING FROM THE INSIDE
GmzjTbzZC30_11 0 RUNNER ONE IS COMING IN THE INSIDE WITH THE BATON IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND RUNNER TWO IS RECEIVING IT IN HIS LEFT HAND SO HE WANTS TO BE TWENTY METERS WITHIN THAT EXCHANGE ZONE BEFORE AND AFTER TO EXTEND TO MAKE SURE RUNNER TWO GOT A FULL EXTENT OF THE BATON PASS
GmzjTbzZC30_12 0 AND HE MUST BE IN FULL SPEED WHILE PASSING THIS BATON
h0Gfjk_apOY_2 0 MY NAME IS MELISSA SHANK AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM TODAY I'M GIVING YOU SOME STRATEGY TECHNIQUES ON LEARNING HOW TO JUGGLE
h0Gfjk_apOY_3 0 ALRIGHT WE'VE JUST LEARNED THE ONE HANDED TOSS AND WE'RE GETTING TO THE TWO HANDED TOSS
h0Gfjk_apOY_4 0 BEFORE WE GET TO THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO STILL WITH ONE BALL AND WE'RE GOING TO CALL THIS THE ONE BALL ARK
h0Gfjk_apOY_5 0 SO GET RID OF THOSE TWO BALLS ONCE AGAIN WE STILL JUST NEED ONE BALL TO GET THIS GOING
h0Gfjk_apOY_6 0 NOW WITH THE ONE HANDED ARK WHAT JUGGLERS TEND TO THINK ABOUT SOMETIMES IS WE REFER TO IT AS THE JUGGLERS BOX
h0Gfjk_apOY_7 0 NOW THINK ABOUT AN ACTUAL SORT OF SQUARE
h0Gfjk_apOY_8 0 OKAY NOW THAT IS YOUR BOX YOUR JUGGLER'S BOX
h0Gfjk_apOY_9 0 WHEN WE WERE THROWING OUR BALL UP WITH THE ONE HANDED TOSS WE WERE JUST GOING UP IN THE AIR
h0Gfjk_apOY_10 0 IF YOU'LL IMAGINE THAT BOX BEING RATHER TALL
h0Gfjk_apOY_11 0 WE WERE THROWING IT UP AND IT WAS HITTING THE ONE SIDE OF THE BOX
h0Gfjk_apOY_12 0 WHAT WE WANT TO DO IT TO CREATE AN ARK SO THAT AT THE TOP OF THE BOX THE BALL GOES UP OVER IN A ARK AND ENDS UP IN YOUR OPPOSITE HAND
h0Gfjk_apOY_13 0 YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS MUCH IN A SAME WAY THAT WE WERE THROWING THE ONE BALL UP AND CATCHING IT IN THE SAME SPOT
h0Gfjk_apOY_14 0 YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO THROW THAT BALL UP IN AN ARK AND HAVE IT LAND IN THIS HAND WITHOUT THAT MUCH TROUBLE
h0Gfjk_apOY_15 0 SO YOU WANT TO TOSS IT UP AND CATCH IT TOSS IT UP AND CATCH IT TOSS IT AND CATCH IT
h0Gfjk_apOY_16 0 YOU CAN GO BACK AND FORTH WITH ONE HAND AS WELL WITH THE OTHER HAND
h0Gfjk_apOY_17 0 UP AND CATCH UP AND CATCH
h0Gfjk_apOY_18 0 PRACTICE THAT ARK BACK AND FORTH
h0Gfjk_apOY_19 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO RUN AROUND SO WHEN YOU ARE JUGGLING YOU WANT TO STAND WITH YOUR FEET STRAIGHT TOGETHER
h0Gfjk_apOY_20 0 USUALLY YOU STAND LEGS FEET SHOULDER WIDTH APART KNEES SLIGHTLY BENT AND AGAIN VERY LOOSE FEELING
h0Gfjk_apOY_21 0 UP AND OVER UP AND OVER
h0Gfjk_apOY_22 0 PRACTICE THAT ARK VERY IMPORTANT
h0Gfjk_apOY_23 0 WE'RE ALMOST THERE
h0Gfjk_apOY_24 0 WE'RE GETTING TO THE TWO HANDED TOSS COMING UP NEXT
gN6V_P6pLAY_1 0 ALRIGHT AGAIN I HAVE A BEAD MANDREL WITH RELEASE AND I TOAST IT GENTLY IN THE FLAME GENTLY
gN6V_P6pLAY_2 0 THE PURPOSE IS TO GET ANY MOISTURE OUT
gN6V_P6pLAY_3 0 SO YOU'LL NOTICE TOO WHEN I DANCE IN THE FLAME I KIND OF DANCE AT AN ANGLE DOWN BUT NOT SIDEWAYS TO ME BECAUSE THE GLASS IF IT FLAKES OR FRACTURES OFF ITS GOING TO KIND OF SHOOT DOWN IN A CONE STRAIGHT FROM WHAT WOULD BE LIKE VISUALIZED AS THE BARREL OF A GUN
gN6V_P6pLAY_4 0 SO I'M HOLDING IT IN
gN6V_P6pLAY_5 0 AND ONCE YOU'RE RED THEN YOU'RE NOT IN ANY DANGER OF THERMAL SHOCK
gN6V_P6pLAY_6 0 AND NOW WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO START TO DRAPE THE MOLTEN GLASS ON TO THE PREHEATED MANDREL
gN6V_P6pLAY_7 0 SO HERE WE GO AND I ROTATE THE PREHEATED MANDREL GRADUALLY AS I APPLY THE MOLTEN GATHER OF GLASS FROM MY FEED CANE WHICH IS IN MY RIGHT HAND
gN6V_P6pLAY_8 0 AND NOTICE TOO HOW I AM BELOW THE FLAME WITH RESPECT TO THE MANDREL
gN6V_P6pLAY_9 0 THE STEEL ROD IS BELOW THE FLAME
gN6V_P6pLAY_10 0 THAT IS MY CANVAS
gN6V_P6pLAY_11 0 THE GLASS IN MY RIGHT HAND CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS THE PAINT AND I'M DOING THE APPLYING OF THE PAINT OR THE HOT GLASS BELOW THE FLAME
gN6V_P6pLAY_12 0 NOTICE NOW ONCE I HAVE APPLIED ALL MY GLASS I AM IN THE FLAME
gN6V_P6pLAY_14 0 AND THEN I'M ROTATING SMOOTHLY AND GRADUALLY AND I PERIODICALLY TAKE THE BEAD OUT TO SEE WHAT I'M DOING SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED
gN6V_P6pLAY_15 0 I'M WEARING MY DIDINIUM LENSES
gN6V_P6pLAY_16 0 DON'T YOU EVER FORGET TO WEAR GLASSES DOING THIS YOU GUYS
gN6V_P6pLAY_17 0 YOU ONLY HAVE ONE SET OF EYES SO PROTECT THEM AT ALL COSTS
gN6V_P6pLAY_18 0 SO NOW I'M TURNING IT AND THE BEAD COLOR WHICH IS GRAY IS GOING TO GRADUALLY RETURN AND I HAVE A BEAUTIFUL SIMPLE ROUND BEAD
gN6V_P6pLAY_19 0 DANCE BACK IN THE FLAME TO REHEAT IT IF THE BEAD IS TOO LONG OUT OF THE FLAME IT WILL CRACK
gN6V_P6pLAY_20 0 SO PERIODICALLY IF YOU WANT TO KEEP WORKING ON THE BEAD YOU NEED TO FLASH IT IN AND OUT OF THE FLAME
gN6V_P6pLAY_21 0 NOT SO MUCH BUT A LOW KIND OF GLOW AND YOU'RE ROTATING
gN6V_P6pLAY_22 0 IT'S MESMERIZING AND THAT'S PART OF THE BEAUTY OF GLASS MAKING THE FUN OF SEEING THE COLORS CHANGE AND THE SHAPE COME TO LIFE RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES
gN6V_P6pLAY_23 0 SO THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE BEAD
gfohtGu3AK4_1 0 ONE REALLY GOOD WAY TO LEARN HOW TO EXIT FROM THE FIFTY FIFTY GRINDS OR LEARN HOW TO OLLIE OUT OF THE FIFTY FIFTY GRINDS IS JUST SOMETIMES TO SET UP YOUR BOARD ON A LEDGE OR CURB SAFELY AND JUST WORK ON OLLIEING OUT OF THAT POSITION
gfohtGu3AK4_2 0 YOU COULD JUST SET YOUR BOARD ON HERE AND DO IT SAFELY
gfohtGu3AK4_3 0 THAT WAY YOU'LL KNOW HOW TO DO HALF OF THE TRICK BEFORE YOU EVEN START TO LEARN HOW TO GET ON TOP OF IT
gfohtGu3AK4_4 0 THIS WILL HELP YOU SO THAT WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF YOUR GRIND YOU'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO
gfohtGu3AK4_5 0 SO YOU COULD JUST SET UP YOUR BOARD ANYWHERE ON A BOTTOM STEP ON A CURB ANYTHING
gfohtGu3AK4_6 0 JUST GET ON TOP OF THE BOARD IN THE FRONT SIDE FIFTY FIFTY POSITION
gfohtGu3AK4_7 0 THIS IS HOW YOU WANT YOUR FEET JUST BEFORE YOU OLLIE OUT
gfohtGu3AK4_8 0 YOU WANT YOUR ONE FOOT ON THE TAIL AND THE OTHER FOOT SOMEWHERE BEHIND THE FRONT BOLTS AND THEN YOU CAN JUST OLLIE OUT LIKE THIS
gfohtGu3AK4_9 0 THIS WAY WHEN YOU DO END UP GRINDING YOU'LL ALREADY HAVE HALF OF THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU'LL NEED AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF IT CLEANLY
gfohtGu3AK4_10 0 YOU CAN DO THIS ANYWHERE YOU COULD EVEN DO IT ONTO GRASS IF YOU WANTED TO BE A LITTLE MORE SAFER
gfohtGu3AK4_11 0 YOU COULD DO IT OFF FROM A CURB AND THEN LAND IN A SAFE POSITION
gln7qLcvnPk_1 0 IN THIS CLIP I SPEAK ABOUT HOW TO USE THE PROPER HAIR COLOR FOR DIFFERENT HAIR TEXTURES
gln7qLcvnPk_2 0 NOW DIFFERENT HAIR TEXTURES I MEAN BY HAIR THAT'S BEEN RELAXED AND IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF TEXTURE THERE STRAIGHT HAIR OR CURLY
gln7qLcvnPk_3 0 THIS YOUNG LADY SHE HAS CURLY HAIR IT'S STRAIGHT RIGHT NOW BUT SHE DOES HAVE CURLY HAIR
gln7qLcvnPk_4 0 I MIGHT WANT TO USE SOMETHING ON HER HAIR THAT IS A SEMI AND NOT SO MUCH A PERMANENT
gln7qLcvnPk_5 0 ONLY BECAUSE IT MIGHT DRY HER HAIR A LITTLE BIT AND TEXTURED HAIR TENDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE DRIER
gln7qLcvnPk_6 0 DEFINITELY WITH RELAXED HAIR YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE A SEMI ALL THE TIME BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO DRY OUT THE HAIR AS MUCH
gln7qLcvnPk_7 0 YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO USE BLEACH AT ALL WITH RELAXED HAIR BECAUSE USUALLY IT WILL CAUSE BREAKAGE AND IT'S THE HAIR'S PORES SO YOU DON'T WANT TO HURT THE HAIR
gln7qLcvnPk_8 0 SO YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND CHOOSE YOUR PROPER HAIR COLOR FOR THE TEXTURE OF THE HAIR
gln7qLcvnPk_9 0 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT
gln7qLcvnPk_10 0 IN THIS HEAD OF HAIR RIGHT HERE YOU'LL NOTICE THAT HER HAIR AGAIN IT'S GOT THE WAVE AND IT'S STRAIGHT BUT SHE HAS A LITTLE FRIZZ IN IT IT IS DRY
gln7qLcvnPk_11 0 I'M GOING TO USE A SEMI IN THIS HAIR COLOR
gln7qLcvnPk_12 0 NOW IF SHE DECIDES TO USE A PERMANENT MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A PERMANENT HAIR COLOR THAT HAS A LOT OF CONDITIONER IN IT
G_yLd9y2nLk_1 0 THE FIRST MOVE WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE NEUTRAL STANCE
G_yLd9y2nLk_2 0 AND THIS IS THE TYPE OF BALL A BALL THAT IS IN FRONT OF YOU YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO STEP INTO IT AND KIND OF ATTACK THE PLAYER
G_yLd9y2nLk_3 0 SO THIS IS MORE FOR THAT FORWARD TYPE OF MOTION
G_yLd9y2nLk_4 0 THIS IS AGAIN FOR ALL LEVELS ALL AGES
G_yLd9y2nLk_5 0 SO WHAT GUSTAVO HERE IS GOING TO DO IS HE IS GOING TO STEP FORWARD INTO THE COURT HE IS GOING TO BASICALLY HIT CROSS COURT BUT STEPPING TOWARDS THAT DIRECTION WITH HIS LEFT FOOT
G_yLd9y2nLk_6 0 AND HIS BODY IS GOING IN THAT DIRECTION AS WELL
G_yLd9y2nLk_7 0 SO WATCH HIS LEFT FOOT AS IT COMES AROUND FOR THIS FOREHAND STEPPING INTO THE COURT
G_yLd9y2nLk_8 0 NOW THE SECOND PHASE OF THAT WOULD BE A RECOVERY STEP
G_yLd9y2nLk_9 0 SO YOU HAVE HIM STEPPING FORWARD RIGHT THERE AND THE SECOND PHASE HIS RIGHT LEG IS GOING TO COME AROUND TO HELP HIM RECOVER FOR THE NEXT SHOT
G_yLd9y2nLk_10 0 SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I FEED A LITTLE BIT WIDER RIGHT HERE HE'LL STEP IN HIS RIGHT LEG COMES AROUND NOW HE IS AT A STRONG BASE TO RECOVER BACK
G_yLd9y2nLk_11 0 SEE THAT RIGHT THERE
G_yLd9y2nLk_12 0 HE HAS A NEUTRAL STEP RIGHT HERE STEPPING IN STRONG RECOVERY BACK RIGHT THERE
G_yLd9y2nLk_13 0 SEE HOW WIDE HIS FEET ARE AFTER HE HITS THE BALL AND THEN HE COMES BACK AROUND THERE
G_yLd9y2nLk_14 0 THAT IS GOING TO HELP YOU STRONGLY RECOVER BACK AND ALSO BE ABLE TO HELP YOU ATTACK THE BALL

gETlUDooWGs_1 0 I'VE BEEN GOING TO CONVENTIONS PROBABLY SINCE ABOUT 1972
gETlUDooWGs_2 0 I'VE SEEN EVOLUTIONS OF CONVENTIONS
gETlUDooWGs_3 0 I'VE BEEN TO BUSINESS CONVENTIONS AND I'VE BEEN TO SCI-FI CONVENTIONS ANIMATE CONVENTIONS CONVENTIONS OF ALL SORTS
gETlUDooWGs_4 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS WHAT IS A CONVENTION AND WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO TO GET A CONVENTION STARTED AND WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO TO GET A CONVENTION MAINTAINED
gETlUDooWGs_5 0 WHO DO YOU INVITE FOR A SOCIAL CONVENTION THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE VERY INTERESTED IN IN YOUR OWN SUBJECT MATTER OR A BUSINESS CONVENTION WHERE YOU WANT BUSINESS PEOPLE TO COME AND LEARN OTHER TOPICS

gETlUDooWGs_7 0 WE'LL TALK ABOUT VENDORS HOW TO FIND VENDORS HOW TO BRING VENDORS IN AND WHAT MAKES A SUCCESSFUL CONVENTION RUN
gETlUDooWGs_8 0 WHETHER OR NOT YOU'VE DECIDED THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF SOMETHING FOR YOUR FRIENDS YOUR FAMILY OR SOMETHING FOR A VERY LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE
gETlUDooWGs_9 0 THE FUN THINGS ABOUT A CONVENTION ARE THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO TRY TO HAVE AS MUCH OF A GOOD TIME AS EVERYONE ELSE
gETlUDooWGs_10 0 YOU WANT IT TO BE GOOD FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE YOU WANT IT TO BE A SUCCESS SO THAT YOU CAN MOVE ON
gETlUDooWGs_11 0 BRING PEOPLE IN THAT YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LIKE
gETlUDooWGs_12 0 AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO BRING ALL OF THIS TOGETHER AND HOW TO HAVE A GOOD TIME FOR YOURSELF AND EVERYONE ELSE
GjOL6-HdRfc_1 0 LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW TO TELL IF YOUR DOG OR CAT HAS INGESTED POISON OR CONTAMINATED FOOD
GjOL6-HdRfc_2 0 IN THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH SOME DIETS THAT HAVE BEEN CONTAMINATED WITH ALL SORTS OF THINGS UNFORTUNATELY AND MOST OF THE TIME IF THERE IS AN INGREDIENT OR THE FOOD IS STALE OR YOUR PET HAS GOTTEN INTO SOME TYPE OF ROTTEN FOOD LET'S SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT WITH A LOT OF BACTERIA IN IT YOU ARE GOING TO SEE MAINLY GASTROINTESTINAL SIGNS AND BY THAT I MEAN VOMITING PRIMARILY DIARRHEA ESPECIALLY AFTER THAT LETHARGY NOT WANTING TO EAT IS ANOTHER COMMON TYPE OF THING AND JUST OVERALL YOUR PET LOOKING LIKE THEY DON'T FEEL GOOD AND SO IF YOU SEE ANYTHING LIKE THAT IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZE IT AS BEING A POTENTIAL PROBLEM AND SEE YOUR VETERINARIAN SO THEY CAN DIAGNOSE IF THERE IS A PROBLEM LIKE THAT
GjOL6-HdRfc_3 0 ALWAYS INSPECT FOODS ESPECIALLY NEW BAGS WHEN YOU OPEN THEM AND JUST LOOK FOR THINGS LIKE MOLD OR FOUL SMELLS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT JUST TO KEEP YOURSELF ON THE ALERT
h3KqRqYeJNI_1 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO IN AND CONTOUR HER FACE A LITTLE BIT AND ADD A LITTLE BLUSH TO HER CHEEKS SO I'M GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BRONZE COLOR AND A BLUSH BRUSH AND I'M GOING TO LIGHTLY SWEEP IT JUST RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE CHEEKBONE AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A LINE
h3KqRqYeJNI_2 0 YOU WANT IT TO BE BLENDED AND LET ME SEE YOUR OTHER SIDE SO JUST LIGHTLY SWEEP UNDERNEATH THE CHEEKBONE BACK AND FORTH AND MAKE SURE YOU GET IT ALL THE WAY INTO THE EAR SO YOU DON'T HAVE A LINE AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE FORGET THAT THEIR EARS ARE PART OF THE THEIR FACE AND IF YOUR EAR IS A DIFFERENT COLOR THEN YOUR FACE IT'S GOING TO LOOK A LITTLE FUNNY
h3KqRqYeJNI_3 0 OK AND NOW I'M GOING TO GO IN WITH A NICE LITTLE PINK ON THE APPLES OF THE CHEEKS SMILE ALEX AND JUST START WITH THE APPLES WHICH IS RIGHT HERE AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO PULL YOUR BRUSH BACK RIGHT ALONG THE CHEEKBONE AND JUST BLEND IT IN AND THEN I'M GOING TO DO A LITTLE LIGHT HIGHLIGHT RIGHT ON THE TOP AND I'M JUST GOING TO SWEEP MY BRUSH BACK AND FORTH A COUPLE OF TIMES ON THE TOP OF THE CHEEKBONE
h3KqRqYeJNI_4 0 OK AND NOW HER CHEEKS ARE READY
G8ED5EkNC3w_1 0 WHAT KIND OF YEAR THOUGH DO YOU FEEL LIKE
G8ED5EkNC3w_2 0 WHERE'S YOUR NEXT LEVEL OF YOUR GAME
G8ED5EkNC3w_3 0 I THINK SOME OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES YOU FACE IN THIS BUSINESS UNLESS YOU GET A GREAT JOB RIGHT OFF THE BAT IS JUST HAVING PATIENCE
G8ED5EkNC3w_4 0 AND BEING WILLING TO PAY YOUR DUES
G8ED5EkNC3w_5 0 I MEAN I HAVE WORKED FOR SMALL NEWSPAPERS
G8ED5EkNC3w_6 0 I HAVE COVERED HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL GAMES WHERE I WAS THE ONLY ONE BASICALLY THERE OTHER THAN THE TEAMS
G8ED5EkNC3w_7 0 I THINK IF YOU AREN'T WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT AND PAY YOUR DUES A LITTLE BIT AND CLIMB THE LADDER YOU MAY GET EASILY FRUSTRATED
G8ED5EkNC3w_8 0 SO I THINK EVERYBODY DEALS WITH SOME FRUSTRATION IN THIS BUSINESS SOMETIME BEFORE YOU CAN GET TO WHERE YOU'RE COVERING SOMETHING YOU REALLY WANT TO COVER AND THAT YOU ENJOY OR GET TO A BIGGER PAPER OR MAKE A BETTER LIVING
G8ED5EkNC3w_9 0 SO SOMETIMES PATIENCE IS A REAL VIRTUE IN THIS BUSINESS
G8ED5EkNC3w_10 0 I THINK ANYBODY THAT WOULD WANT TO DO THIS WOULD NEED TO GO TO A GOOD JOURNALISM SCHOOL GET AN INTERNSHIP AT A NEWSPAPER WHILE THEY'RE IN SCHOOL AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THEIR BEST AVENUE TOWARD GETTING A JOB IN THIS BUSINESS
G8ED5EkNC3w_11 0 YOU NEED TO HAVE A PASSION FOR IT
G8ED5EkNC3w_12 0 YOU NEED TO NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH WORKING NIGHTS OR WEEKENDS
G8ED5EkNC3w_13 0 IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THOSE THINGS THIS PROBABLY ISN'T THE FIELD FOR YOU
gfhUMyYoBxM_1 0 HI I AM CHRISTOPHER FROM EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
gfhUMyYoBxM_2 0 I HAVE MY LADDER HERE AND I WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW TO AVOID AND TO SHOW YOU HOW I HAUL AROUND A LADDER
gfhUMyYoBxM_3 0 FIRST I HAVE THIS CAR HERE AND SAY I CANNOT MOVE IT
gfhUMyYoBxM_4 0 BE MINDFUL OF WHAT IS AROUND YOU AND TAKE A LOOK AROUND
gfhUMyYoBxM_5 0 I AM TRYING TO GET THIS LADDER FROM THE GROUND TO THIS WINDOW IN FROM OF ME
gfhUMyYoBxM_6 0 I WANT TO KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE IN MY WAY
gfhUMyYoBxM_7 0 FOR INSTANCE SOMETIMES THERE ARE TREES SOMETIMES THERE ARE TELEPHONE LINES SO YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TAKE A LOOK UP AND SEE WHAT MIGHT BE IN THE WAY
gfhUMyYoBxM_8 0 THIS IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD
gfhUMyYoBxM_9 0 THIS IS JUST A MATTER OF TAKING OUR LADDER STRAIGHT UP TO THE BUILDING BUT OFTEN YOU WILL FIND TREES AND OTHER OBSTACLES ABOVE YOU OVERHANGS OF THE ROOF
gfhUMyYoBxM_10 0 YOU WANT TO BE MINDFUL IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS ABOVE YOU BEFORE YOU TAKE YOUR LADDER AND TRY TO PUT IT IN POSITION BECAUSE YOU MIGHT FIND THAT YOU COULD BE DAMAGING SOMETHING
gfhUMyYoBxM_11 0 THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO PICK IT UP
gfhUMyYoBxM_12 0 YOU CAN PICK IT UP AND WALK IT AROUND WITH YOU THIS WAY AND TO SET UP A LADDER ESPECIALLY IF IT IS A 32 FOOT LADDER THIS IS ONLY A 24 FOOT LADDER
gfhUMyYoBxM_13 0 FIND A LEVERAGE POINT PUSH IT UP AND ANOTHER THING TO WATCH FOR IS THESE ALWAYS WANT TO BE ANGLED DOWN TOWARD YOU THE ANGLE NEEDS TO BE TOWARD YOU SO BASICALLY THIS IS THE WRONG WAY AND I NEED TO TURN IT AROUND
gfhUMyYoBxM_14 0 I WANT TO DEMONSTRATE THE WAY I LIKE TO CARRY THE LADDER WHICH IS EASIER FOR ME
gfhUMyYoBxM_15 0 I LIKE TO GET UNDERNEATH IT AND WALK IT AROUND THIS WAY AND AS LONG AS THERE IS NOTHING UP ABOVE YOU TO GET IN YOUR WAY THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO HAUL YOUR LADDER AROUND
gKQ8LinxXKI_1 0 HI MY NAME IS STEVE MUNOZ
gKQ8LinxXKI_2 0 I'M FROM DUNCAN BUSINESS MACHINES AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT CERTAIN CODES THAT YOU NEED TO FAX TO CERTAIN COUNTRIES
gKQ8LinxXKI_3 0 WE GET A LOT OF CALLS FROM PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KNOW WHAT CODE TO USE
gKQ8LinxXKI_4 0 WE DON'T KNOW
gKQ8LinxXKI_5 0 WE KNOW SOME OF THEM
gKQ8LinxXKI_6 0 BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS IN GENERAL LIKE RUSSIA FOR EXAMPLE IT'S ZERO-ONE-ONE WHICH IS OUR CODE SEVEN PLUS THE AREA CODE PLUS THE FAX NUMBER AND START
gKQ8LinxXKI_7 0 PROCEDURE IS BASICALLY THE SAME
gKQ8LinxXKI_8 0 WHAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE IS THEIR SPECIFIC CODES
gKQ8LinxXKI_9 0 YOU CAN GO TO ON THE INTERNET YOU CAN GO TO COUNTRYCODES.COM
gKQ8LinxXKI_10 0 CLICK ON WHERE YOU'RE SENDING FROM WHERE YOU'RE SENDING TO

H6DHOeeDBdY_1 0 JOHN CARSTARPHEN HI
H6DHOeeDBdY_2 0 THIS IS JOHN CARSTARPHEN FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
H6DHOeeDBdY_3 0 NOW WE'VE HAD SOME PROBLEMS LINING UP THE PHOTOGRAPHS AS THEY WERE TAKEN ORIGINALLY IN POSER
H6DHOeeDBdY_4 0 SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS I'VE TAKEN THE PHOTOGRAPHS BACK INTO PHOTOSHOP AND I'VE DONE A SIMPLE LINEUP USING THE GRIDS IN PHOTOSHOP
H6DHOeeDBdY_5 0 AND TO DO THAT I'VE ISOLATED EACH FACE AND PUT THEM ON DIFFERENT LAYERS SO THAT THE TOP LAYER IS THE FRONT VIEW AND THE BOTTOM LAYER IS THE SIDE VIEW
H6DHOeeDBdY_6 0 AND THEN IT'S JUST A MATTER OF LINING UP THE EYES AND THE MOUTHS AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE
H6DHOeeDBdY_7 0 AND I COULD PROBABLY EVEN DO SOME SCALING OF ONE OF THESE PHOTOGRAPHS TO MAKE THEM LINE UP EVEN MORE
H6DHOeeDBdY_8 0 BUT ONCE THAT'S DONE THEN I EXPORT EACH IMAGE EACH LAYERS SEPARATELY AS A SEPARATE IMAGE AND AS A JPEG FILE
H6DHOeeDBdY_9 0 NOW YOU'LL NOTICE THAT OFF TO THE SIDES HERE WE HAVE QUITE A BIT OF WHITE SPACE AND OF COURSE WE HAD THAT GREEN BACKGROUND
H6DHOeeDBdY_10 0 NOW WE CAN KNOCK OUT THE GREEN BACKGROUND IN PHOTOSHOP OR ANOTHER PROGRAM BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH THIS WHITE SPACE IS WE'D HAVE TO PAINT AROUND THE IMAGE SO THAT WE'D HAVE THIS BLEND INTO A SKIN TONE
H6DHOeeDBdY_11 0 FOR INSTANCE IF I WERE TO SELECT THE PAINTBRUSH AND THE EYEDROPPER TOOL I PROBABLY WANT TO TAKE A SKIN TONE SOMEWHERE IN THERE AND THEN ADD A NEW LAYER AND PERHAPS BEGIN PAINTING LIKE THIS
H6DHOeeDBdY_12 0 AND THEN USING THE BLUR TOOLS AND THE SMUDGE TOOLS I'D TRY TO BLEND THAT IN A LITTLE MORE SO THAT WHAT WE'D END UP WITH IS SOMETHING THAT LOOKS A LOT LIKE A TEXTURE MAP
H6DHOeeDBdY_13 0 IN OTHER WORDS YOU HAVE THE KEY FACIAL FEATURES APPARENT AND CLEAR SUCH AS THE EYES EYEBROWS NOSE MOUTH CHIN AND SOME OF THE CREASES IN THE FACE AND THE FRECKLES AND SO FORTH
H6DHOeeDBdY_14 0 WE WANT TO KEEP ALL THOSE DETAIL FEATURES BUT WE HAVE TO LOOSE THE STUFF AROUND THE SIDE
GIzqSW-MQrQ_1 0 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FROST
GIzqSW-MQrQ_2 0 WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT THESE SEEDS IN AFTER IT HAS FROSTED
GIzqSW-MQrQ_3 0 IF AND WE ALSO WANT TO WATCH THE WEATHER SO IF WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO RAIN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PLANT THESE SEEDS A COUPLE A DAY BEFORE IT RAINS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO BE OUT HERE WATERING ALL THE TIME
GIzqSW-MQrQ_4 0 THESE SEEDS IF THEY'RE IF YOU OBSERVE THE WEATHER THEN YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE RAINS AND THESE SEEDS AFTER YOU PLANT THEM SHOULD COME UP TO THREE OR FOUR DAYS AFTER YOU PLANT THEM AND THAT'S WHY YOU WANT TO COORDINATE IT WITH THE WEATHER SO THAT THE RAIN SOAKS THEM IN AND THEY CAN HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF A STRONG GERMINATION
GIzqSW-MQrQ_5 0 AND THEREFORE THE WEATHER IS VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS GROWING OF THE LETTUCE
g7r6pLpJAwQ_1 0 OKAY NOW WE HAVE OUR BLANCHED ASPARAGUS TIPS AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT THOSE TO A SIDE IN A BOWL AND I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO EMPTY THIS BOWL RIGHT NOW
g7r6pLpJAwQ_2 0 I REALLY REUSE MY BOWLS A LOT IF THERE CLEAN I'LL REUSE THEM SO HERE GO THE BLANCHED ASPARAGUS TIPS AND THE OTHER FABA BEANS THAT I THREW IN THERE I DO THOSE LATER WATCHING TV OR LISTENING TO SOME BEAUTIFUL MUSIC
g7r6pLpJAwQ_3 0 SO THESE ARE TIPS THAT ARE GOING IN THE SALAD OKAY AND I GOT THEM ALL OUT OF THERE YOU CAN DO THIS OVER THE SINK AS WELL BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE ICE WATER OKAY
g7r6pLpJAwQ_4 0 THEN OUR NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO SLICE THE STOCKS AND THERE SUPPOSE TO BE SLICED 1/8 THICK AND HERE'S A LITTLE WHEN YOU BUY ASPARAGUS SOMETIMES SOME OF IT IS A LITTLE WRINKLED YOU WANT IT PERFECT YOU WANT TO TAKE OFF THE HARD END AND THROW THAT AWAY AND SAVE THE STOCK AND THEN I JUST LINE THEM UP LIKE THIS TO MAKE QUICK WORK
g7r6pLpJAwQ_5 0 BECAUSE AS YOU CAN SEE JUST DOING ONE AT A TIME ISN'T SUCH A GREAT THING BUT YOU CAN LINE THEM ALL UP AND GET READY TO CUT AND I NEED TO GET MY CHEF KNIFE
g7r6pLpJAwQ_6 0 OKAY SO I'M GOING TO QUICKLY CUT THESE AND 1/8 ROUNDS AND THERE GOING TO GET TOSSED RIGHT INTO THE SALAD AND YOU CAN SEE I'M USING THE SAME ROCKING MOTION THAT I SHOWED YOU BEFORE
g7r6pLpJAwQ_7 0 EXCEPT THIS TIME I'M HOLDING ONTO THE ASPARAGUS NOT THE FRONT OF THE KNIFE AND I'M JUST CUTTING THEM VERY VERY THIN
g7r6pLpJAwQ_8 0 WHEN YOU GET TO THE END FINGERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ASPARAGUS SO IF YOU CAN'T GET TO THE LAST LITTLE ENDS WITHOUT CUTTING YOURSELF PLEASE DON'T
g7r6pLpJAwQ_9 0 BUT THIS IS WHAT THEY SHOULD LOOK LIKE WHEN THERE FINISHED AND I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE THESE FEW SMALL ENDS AND DO THEM NOT INDIVIDUALLY BUT JUST SO THAT I WON'T INJURE MYSELF IN THE PROCESS
g7r6pLpJAwQ_10 0 OKAY THAT'S READY TO GO
gsbBRXcJhTA_1 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO SKATEBOARD THE FIRST THING YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO LEARN IS HOW TO PUSH
gsbBRXcJhTA_2 0 THE EASIEST WAY TO FIGURE THAT OUT IS TO HAVE A FRIEND STAND BEHIND YOU AND PUSH YOU FORWARD WHICHEVER FOOT YOU STEP FORWARD WITH IS GOING TO BE YOUR FRONT FOOT
gsbBRXcJhTA_3 0 I USUALLY STEP FORWARD WITH MY RIGHT FOOT MEANING THAT I WOULD RIDE GOOFY
gsbBRXcJhTA_4 0 WHICH IS WITH YOUR LEFT FOOT IN THE BACK RIGHT FOOT IN THE FRONT
gsbBRXcJhTA_5 0 BUT SOME PEOPLE MAY RIDE REGULAR WHICH IS RIGHT FOOT IN THE BACK LEFT FOOT IN THE FRONT
gsbBRXcJhTA_6 0 AND THE IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN YOU PUSH IS TO AIM YOUR FOOT IN THE DIRECTION THAT YOU WANT TO GO
gsbBRXcJhTA_7 0 AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH JUST A KICKING MOTION AGAINST THE GROUND CONTROLLING IT FROM THAT POINT ON
gsbBRXcJhTA_8 0 AND LIKE I SAID THIS IS PRETTY MUCH THE BASIC FOUNDATION OF EVERYTHING IN SKATEBOARDING
gsbBRXcJhTA_9 0 YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SPEED TO PERFORM THE TRICKS THAT I'M GOING TO BE TEACHING YOU IN THE REST OF THE SERIES
gsbBRXcJhTA_10 0 SO JUST KEEP IN MIND TO AIM YOUR FRONT FOOT FORWARD OR WHEREVER YOU WANT TO GO BECAUSE WHERE YOU AIM YOUR FOOT IS THE DIRECTION THAT THE BOARD IS GOING TO SEND YOU
H5AJOM7RRg0_1 0 NOW THIS IS A DOUBLE PRUSIK KNOT
H5AJOM7RRg0_2 0 THE DOUBLE PRUSIK KNOT IS BASICALLY JUST AN EXTRA BEND OVER YOUR REGULAR PRUSIK KNOT
H5AJOM7RRg0_3 0 I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN DOWN HERE
H5AJOM7RRg0_4 0 I HAVE MY PRUSIK KNOT ALL READY SET UP SO I CAN SHOW YOU
H5AJOM7RRg0_5 0 I HAVE IT WRAPPED AROUND THIS HERE
H5AJOM7RRg0_6 0 NOW THIS IS A MOUNTAINEER S TYPE KNOT
H5AJOM7RRg0_7 0 SO THIS WOULD ACTUALLY BE A LINE OR ROPE HERE INSTEAD OF THIS BLOCK OF WOOD
H5AJOM7RRg0_8 0 BUT FOR EASE OF INSTRUCTION I'VE GOT WOOD HERE
H5AJOM7RRg0_9 0 AND BASICALLY THIS IS MY PRUSIK HERE
H5AJOM7RRg0_10 0 AND INSTEAD OF TIGHTENING DOWN YOU CAN SEE I'VE STILL GOT MY LOOP HERE
H5AJOM7RRg0_11 0 SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO BRING MY LOOP BACK AROUND ONE EXTRA TURN
H5AJOM7RRg0_12 0 AND I'M GOING TO PULL MY LINES THROUGH LIKE SO
H5AJOM7RRg0_13 0 NOW AS YOU CAN SEE THIS KNOT IS NOT GOING TO SLIP
H5AJOM7RRg0_14 0 ESPECIALLY IF THIS WAS A ROPE INSTEAD OF THIS WOOD THIS WOOD IS A LITTLE BIT SLICK SO THIS KNOT WILL SLIP ON THIS
H5AJOM7RRg0_15 0 BUT USUALLY IN WET AND MUDDY CONDITIONS CLIMBERS WILL USE THIS RIGHT HERE ON ANOTHER ROPE TO KEEP THIS FROM MOVING
H5AJOM7RRg0_16 0 SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO UNDO THIS AND I'LL JUST RUN ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS OF RUNNING A PRUSIK KNOT
H5AJOM7RRg0_17 0 AND THEN THE DOUBLE PRUSIK
H5AJOM7RRg0_18 0 BECAUSE MAYBE IT WOULD BE JUST A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND HERE
H5AJOM7RRg0_19 0 PULL MY LINE OUT AND I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TIE MY LITTLE WORKING ENDS TOGETHER I'VE GOT
H5AJOM7RRg0_20 0 JUST A DOUBLE OVERHAND LIKE SO
H5AJOM7RRg0_21 0 TAKE IT AND I'LL RUN IT THROUGH
H5AJOM7RRg0_22 0 AND RUN MY LOOP THROUGH ONCE AND RUN IT THROUGH AGAIN
H5AJOM7RRg0_23 0 AND WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE LENGTH
H5AJOM7RRg0_24 0 RUN IT THROUGH TWICE
H5AJOM7RRg0_25 0 MAKE SURE THAT THESE DON'T CROSS OVER LIKE THIS MAKE SURE THAT THIS KNOT IS NICE AND NEAT
H5AJOM7RRg0_26 0 BECAUSE THIS IS A SAFETY LINE FOR US
H5AJOM7RRg0_27 0 WE'RE GOING TO PULL IT OVER ONE MORE TIME AND THROUGH LIKE SO
H5AJOM7RRg0_28 0 LET'S GET THIS THROUGH RIGHT HERE
H5AJOM7RRg0_29 0 AND THERE YOU GO
H5AJOM7RRg0_30 0 YOUR DOUBLE PRUSIK
GhhzAPFwzas_1 0 HI THIS IS YOLANDA VANVEEN FROM VANVEENBULBS.COM
GhhzAPFwzas_2 0 AND IN THIS SECTION WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO CLONE PLANTS
GhhzAPFwzas_3 0 NOT THIS SUBJECT I REALLY AM VERY INTERESTED IN BECAUSE I'VE FOUND THAT MOST OF THE PLANTS IN THE WORLD HAVE BEEN CLONED
GhhzAPFwzas_4 0 AND IT'S FASCINATING TO ME THE WHOLE PROCESS AND HOW IT WORKS
GhhzAPFwzas_5 0 BUT IT'S VERY SIMPLE
GhhzAPFwzas_6 0 PLANTS ARE ASEXUAL THAT MEANS THAT HAVE ALL THE GENETICS WITHIN THEMSELVES
GhhzAPFwzas_7 0 THEY DON'T NEED A BOY AND A GIRL PLANT TO MAKE BABIES
GhhzAPFwzas_8 0 AND IT'S REALLY EASY TO SEE THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT A LILY BULB
GhhzAPFwzas_9 0 A LILY BULB CLONES ITSELF
GhhzAPFwzas_10 0 SO EACH LITTLE CLOVE JUST LIKE A GARLIC WILL MAKE ITS OWN PLANT
GhhzAPFwzas_11 0 SO WHEN THERE'S A NEW VARIETY OF LILY COMES OUT THAT IS SPECIAL OR EXCITING ONE THAT THEY WANT TO REPRODUCE THEY CLONE IT BY JUST SEPARATING IT INTO LITTLE PIECES
GhhzAPFwzas_12 0 AND THAT WAY THEY'LL START THIRTY FORTY NEW PLANTS FROM ONE
GhhzAPFwzas_13 0 AND IT'LL BE IDENTICALLY GENETIC TO THE MOTHER PLANT
GhhzAPFwzas_14 0 AND THAT WAY IF YOU HAVE A NEW BREED OF COLOR THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING OR WORTH A LOT OF MONEY YOU CAN CLONE IT VERY EASILY
GhhzAPFwzas_16 0 THERE ALSO CLONING THROUGH TISSUE CULTURE NOW TOO
GhhzAPFwzas_17 0 SO ALL THEY NEED IS ONE CELL
GhhzAPFwzas_18 0 EVERY LITTLE CELL JUST A FINGERNAIL SCRATCHING OF THAT PLANT HAS ALL THE DNA MAKEUP FOR IT
GhhzAPFwzas_19 0 AND THEY CAN CLONE FORM THAT ONE LITTLE SAMPLE THROUGH TISSUE CULTURE
GhhzAPFwzas_20 0 AND THEY JUST LET IT GROW INTO A BULBLET AND THEN IT GROWS INTO A BULB FROM ONE LITTLE CELL
GhhzAPFwzas_21 0 IT'S AMAZING TO ME
GhhzAPFwzas_22 0 SO PLANTS CAN ALSO CLONE THEMSELVES BY ROOTS
GhhzAPFwzas_23 0 SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THE MOTHER PLANT JUST MAKES MORE ROOTS AND MAKES A BABY
GhhzAPFwzas_24 0 SO THE BABY IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE MOTHER AND THERE'S NO GENETIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO
GhhzAPFwzas_25 0 AND THAT'S AN EASY WAY FOR GRASS FOR EXAMPLE THIS FLAX TO MULTIPLY
GhhzAPFwzas_26 0 THEY ALSO PRODUCE SEEDS AND SEEDS ARE MIXED WITH OTHER TYPES OF GRASSES AND THEY CAN BE DIFFERENT GENETICALLY
GhhzAPFwzas_27 0 BUT CLONES ARE NEVER DIFFERENT GENETICALLY THAN THE MOTHER PLANT
GhhzAPFwzas_28 0 ANOTHER WAY THAT PLANTS CLONE THEMSELVES IS THROUGH RUNNERS
GhhzAPFwzas_29 0 SO A LILAC WILL HAVE DIFFERENT SHOOTS COMING OUT THE BOTTOM AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY PULL THAT SHOOT UP AND THAT'S BASICALLY A CLONE OF ITS MOTHER IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN THE MOTHER
GhhzAPFwzas_30 0 AND PLANTS LIKE THIS GERANIUM YOU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE ROOT CUTTINGS YOU CAN TAKE STEM CUTTINGS AND IT WILL MAKE ITS OWN PLANT
GhhzAPFwzas_31 0 AND THOSE ARE CLONES THEY'RE AN EXACT REPRODUCTION OF THE MOTHER PLANT
GhhzAPFwzas_32 0 AND THE EASIEST WAY THAT I HAVE FOUND TO CLONE PLANTS OR TO TAKE ROOT CUTTINGS IS JUST TAKE BASIC HONEY AND PUT IT INTO A STRAIGHT SHOT JAR OR A STRAIGHT SHOT GLASS IT MAKES IT REALLY EASY AND YOU DON'T USE A LOT THAT WAY
GhhzAPFwzas_33 0 AND WHEN YOU'RE TAKING A STEM GO TO WHERE TWO STARTS MEETS
GhhzAPFwzas_34 0 SO AT THIS POINT AS LONG AS I BREAK IT AWAY FROM THE STEM
GhhzAPFwzas_35 0 AND I ALWAYS TRY AND DO IT WHERE THE NEXT LEAF IS AND THAT WAY IT WILL FILL IN TOGETHER ALL TOGETHER
GhhzAPFwzas_36 0 SO JUST BY TAKING A CUTTING
GhhzAPFwzas_37 0 YOU CAN TEAR IT OFF OR CUT IT OFF IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER I HAVE FOUND BECAUSE THEY'LL GROW ROOTS
GhhzAPFwzas_38 0 AND A LOT OF TIMES SAY CUT IT AT AN ANGLE BUT I FOUND BY LEAVING IT AT A LITTLE BIT OF A SHRED IT'LL ROOT EVEN BETTER
GhhzAPFwzas_39 0 SO THE EASIEST WAY TO START A NEW GERANIUM AND I HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT EVEN DIPPING IT INTO HONEY JUST PUT IT RIGHT INTO SOIL
GhhzAPFwzas_40 0 JUST DIP IT INTO A LITTLE HONEY
GhhzAPFwzas_41 0 AND THE HONEY ACTUALLY ACTS IT GIVES IT ENERGY TOO BECAUSE OF THE SUGAR
GhhzAPFwzas_42 0 SO IT SEEMS TO BOND AND THAT WAY THE ROOTS SEEM TO GROW BETTER
GhhzAPFwzas_43 0 AND YOU JUST PUT IT MAYBE ONE TO TWO INCHES ONE TO TWO INCHES IN THE GROUND
GhhzAPFwzas_44 0 AND IT ALSO HELPS TO CUT SOME OF THE BOTTOM LEAVES OFF SO THAT JUST THE TOP LEAVES ARE LEFT
GhhzAPFwzas_45 0 AND THAT WAY THEY SEEM TO GROW BETTER BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT MORE ENERGY TO PUT TO THE TOP LEAVES
GhhzAPFwzas_46 0 AND IF YOU KEEP CHECKING ON IT I HAVE FOUND IN GERANIUMS WILL GROW QUITE QUICKLY AND WITHIN A MONTH YOU'LL HAVE ANOTHER PLANT
HifGtv6bniQ_1 0 RICK GEISSLER HI I'M RICK GEISSLER EXPERTVILLAGE.COM COMING TO YOU FROM A & R TIRE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO BUY TIRES
HifGtv6bniQ_2 0 ON EVERY TIRE TODAY BUILT NOT ONLY YOU'LL SEE THIS ON THIS STICKER BUT IF THE STICKER'S NOT THERE IT'S MOLDED INTO THE SIDE WALL OF THE TIRE
HifGtv6bniQ_3 0 THAT GOES FOR ALL PASSENGER AND LIGHT-TRUCK TIRES
HifGtv6bniQ_4 0 AND WHEN YOU GET INTO P-METRIC I'M SORRY WHEN YOU GET INTO THE LIGHT-TRUCK LOAD-RATING TIRES IT'S NOT ON THE TIRE ITSELF
HifGtv6bniQ_5 0 BUT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR YOU CAN ALWAYS LOOK AT THE AA OR WHATEVER THAT TIRES HAS
HifGtv6bniQ_6 0 BUT ALSO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR LOAD RATINGS AFTER YOUR SPEED RATING ON A TIRE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE LOAD RATING AND THE LOAD RATING HERE IS AN INDEX OF 97
HifGtv6bniQ_7 0 YOU CAN GO TO A BOOK AND GET THE CALCULATION OF THAT LOAD RATING FOR THAT VEHICLE TO MAKE SURE AND THAT'S ANOTHER NUMBER YOU NEVER WANT TO DECREASE THAT SO YOU DON'T BUY A SET OF TIRES THAT HAVE AN 84 LOAD RATING WHEN YOUR TIRES CAME WITH A 92
hgZ_GabeHAQ_1 0 THE FIRST POINT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS CROOKED POOL OR LARGE INTESTINE ELEVEN
hgZ_GabeHAQ_2 0 THIS ONE IS PARTICULARLY GOOD FOR DRAINING HEAT AND DAMPNESS IN THE ELBOW JOINT
hgZ_GabeHAQ_3 0 SO THIS IS ONE WE WANT TO USE ESPECIALLY FOR A DOG WHO HAS HOT TENDER TO THE TOUCH ELBOW
hgZ_GabeHAQ_4 0 THIS WOULD BE A PARTICULARLY GOOD ONE
hgZ_GabeHAQ_5 0 THE DAMPNESS IF THE LEG TENDS TO SWELL UP OR IF THE DOG RESPONDS AND IS IN WORSE PAIN ON DAMP DAYS THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD POINT FOR YOU TO USE
hgZ_GabeHAQ_6 0 IF YOUR DOG TENDS TO BE ONE THAT PANTS A LOT AND IS USUALLY HOT AND TIRED YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO USE THIS POINT
hgZ_GabeHAQ_7 0 YOU WANT TO SKIP IT
hgZ_GabeHAQ_8 0 IT IS FOUND BY GOING DOWN INTO THE CREASE OF THE ELBOW RIGHT IN THE SIDE
hgZ_GabeHAQ_9 0 AND AS WITH MOST ACUPRESSURE POINTS YOUR FINGER'S GOING TO FALL INTO THIS HOLE
hgZ_GabeHAQ_10 0 AND THAT'S WHERE YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR PRESSURE
hgZ_GabeHAQ_11 0 YOU CAN DO A STEADY ONE FINGER PRESSURE JUST STAYING IN THAT PLACE OR YOU CAN DO A CIRCULAR MOTION WITH YOUR THUMB OR WITH THE BALL OF YOUR FINGER
hgZ_GabeHAQ_12 0 ANY OF THOSE WILL WORK JUST FINE
hE4PE72Ws6c_1 0 BILL ALBIN HELLO I'M BILL ALBIN

hE4PE72Ws6c_3 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT VOS
hE4PE72Ws6c_4 0 THE VOS ARE ONE OF THE FOUR BASIC STORY TYPES
hE4PE72Ws6c_5 0 THOSE BEING THE READERS VOS VOSOTS AND PACKAGES
hE4PE72Ws6c_6 0 WHAT SETS THE VO APART FROM THE OTHERS IS IT'S JUST VIDEO
hE4PE72Ws6c_7 0 VO STANDS FOR VOICE OVER
hE4PE72Ws6c_8 0 THAT MEANS ME TALKING AND VIDEO FLOWING BY
hE4PE72Ws6c_9 0 YOU WOULDN'T SEE ME IN THE PICTURE ITSELF
hE4PE72Ws6c_10 0 I'D BE OFF SOMEWHERE ELSE DOING MY OWN THING AND YOU WOULD ONLY SEE VIDEO
hE4PE72Ws6c_11 0 YOU'D STILL HEAR ME TALKING BUT YOU WOULDN'T SEE ME
hE4PE72Ws6c_12 0 THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY SOUND BITES
hE4PE72Ws6c_13 0 THERE WILL BE NO PRE-PACKAGED MATERIALS THAT GO WITH IT
hE4PE72Ws6c_14 0 YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN SEE ME ON CAMERA DURING THE ENTIRE STORY AT ANY TIME
hE4PE72Ws6c_15 0 AND WHAT WOULD YOU USE THE VIDEO FOR
hE4PE72Ws6c_16 0 WELL IT'S A STORY THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO SEE ME IN
hE4PE72Ws6c_17 0 YOU DON'T NEED A SOUND BITE FOR
hE4PE72Ws6c_18 0 LET'S SAY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THE AUTO SHOW AND PEOPLE JUST WANT TO SEE THE PRETTY CARS
hE4PE72Ws6c_19 0 THEY WANT TO SEE THE NEW FLASHY SUPERCHARGED THIS OR THE ZERO TO SIXTY THAT
hE4PE72Ws6c_20 0 THEY DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT ME
hE4PE72Ws6c_21 0 THEY WANT TO LOOK AT THE NEW SPORTS CAR
hE4PE72Ws6c_22 0 WELL WE SHOW THEM THE NEW SPORTS CAR AND IT'S RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF THEM AND THEY WOULD NEVER SEE ME AT ANY POINT DURING THAT STORY
h4PqGhVw3Yk_2 0 MY NAME IS GREG GOLDBERG
h4PqGhVw3Yk_3 0 WE ARE HERE AT MINETTI'S ITALIAN SPECIALTIES AT WAYNE PA
h4PqGhVw3Yk_4 0 I HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE ARE COOKING CHICKEN PARMIGIANA
h4PqGhVw3Yk_5 0 WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR OIL TO ABOUT 350 DEGREES SO WE ARE GOING TO PUT THAT ON MEDIUM HIGH AND WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR SAUCE UP TO BOIL HERE
h4PqGhVw3Yk_6 0 WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT ON MEDIUM LOW BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THE SUGARS IN THE TOMATO SAUCE GET CARAMELIZED AND GIVE IT THAT KIND OF BURNT FLAVOR
h4PqGhVw3Yk_7 0 THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR
gitlNe_51ho_1 0 ALRIGHT ELSEWHERE IN THIS SERIES WE'VE COVERED HOW TO GRIP THE CLUB
gitlNe_51ho_2 0 HOWEVER I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHY A GOOD GRIP MATTERS OR A BAD GRIP CAN KILL YOU
gitlNe_51ho_3 0 SO IF I GRIP IT PROPERLY LIKE THAT
gitlNe_51ho_4 0 OKAY NOW I'M READY TO TAKE THE CLUB BACK PROPERLY AND TO PUT PROPER POWER FROM THE BODY INTO HITTING THE BALL
gitlNe_51ho_5 0 BUT IF YOU'VE GOT A WEAK GRIP WHAT THIS PRODUCES LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE SEPARATE THEIR HANDS SO THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE BASEBALL SWINGING AT IT SO THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO HIT A CONSISTENT POWERFUL SHOT
gitlNe_51ho_6 0 OR THEY JUST FLAIL AT IT THEY JUST HOLD IT LIKE THAT BUT THEY DO A VARIETY OF THINGS
gitlNe_51ho_7 0 ONE OF THE MOST COMMON THINGS IS THEY LET THE RIGHT HAND OPEN UP TOO MUCH SO THEN THEY'RE LIKE THIS TRYING TO USE THEIR ARMS AND SHOULDERS TOO MUCH
gitlNe_51ho_8 0 SO WHY A GOOD GRIP MATTERS
gitlNe_51ho_9 0 THERE'S VERY FEW GREAT PLAYERS THAT HAVE BAD GRIPS BECAUSE THE GRIP IS LIKE THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE CLUB IS CONNECTED TO THE BODY AND THAT'S HOW THE BODY IS CONNECTED TO THE CLUB
gitlNe_51ho_10 0 SO IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR SWING
gitlNe_51ho_11 0 SO GETTING THE GRIP RIGHT WILL ALLOW YOU TO HIT A BALL NICELY BUT A POOR GRIP WILL GIVE YOU ALL TYPES OF COMPENSATIONS BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT IS
gitlNe_51ho_12 0 WHEN YOU HAVE A BAD GRIP YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THE CLUB MOVING WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY
gitlNe_51ho_13 0 SO THAT'S WHY A GOOD GRIP IS YOUR BEST FRIEND AND A BAD GRIP CAN REALLY TORPEDO ALL YOUR PRACTICE

g-Sodm6JsUo_1 0 WHEN IT COMES TO BRAIDING HAIR IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF STABILIZER
g-Sodm6JsUo_2 0 I DO NOT RECOMMEND MOUSSE
g-Sodm6JsUo_3 0 THEY TEND TO FLAKE AND THEY DON'T HAVE A STRONG ENOUGH HOLD
g-Sodm6JsUo_4 0 GEL IS GREAT TO USE WHILE YOU WORK BUT AFTER THE HAIR STYLE HAS BEEN COMPLETED IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF HAIR SPRAY
g-Sodm6JsUo_5 0 WHAT I HAVE HERE IS A GEOVANNI HAIR SPRAY THAT'S MAXIMUM STRENGTH HOLD BUT ITS PURE ORGANIC TECHNOLOGY
g-Sodm6JsUo_6 0 WHEN YOU FINISH YOUR HAIR STYLE IT'S GREAT TO JUST TAKE THE SPRAY AND SPRAY IT OVER THE ENTIRE HEAD JUST TO MAKE SURE ALL THE LITTLE STRAY HAIRS STAY BACK
g-Sodm6JsUo_7 0 BECAUSE THE BRAIDS ARE GOING TO BE WORN FOR A DECENT AMOUNT OF TIME AND YOU WANT THE QUALITY OF THE STYLE TO LAST AS LONG AS IT CAN
g-Sodm6JsUo_8 0 NOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL BRAID JUST SPRAY RIGHT ALONG DOWN THE BRAID AND THEN RUB IT DOWN JUST TO TRY TO GET THOSE LITTLE STRAY HAIRS
g-Sodm6JsUo_9 0 I LIKE TO SQUEEZE IT DOWN INSTEAD OF RUBBING TO HARD BECAUSE THAT CAN MAKE THE PROBLEM JUST A LITTLE BIT WORSE
g-Sodm6JsUo_10 0 KEEPING THAT IN THERE THE HAIRSPRAY WILL HELP ADD JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SHINE AND KEEP THEM HAIRS FROM STANDING OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH
hExcvhzdrJk_1 0 ANOTHER WAY THAT YOU CAN WORK WITH THIS IS YOU CAN USE IT ALMOST AS A LIE DETECTOR
hExcvhzdrJk_2 0 YOUR BODY CANNOT TELL A LIE OR HEAR A LIE AND STAY STRONG AND THATS JUST A PHYSIOLOGICAL FACT
hExcvhzdrJk_3 0 AND WE'LL DEMONSTRATE THAT SAY MY NAME IS ALEX OK AND YOU SEE HIS ARM LOCKS
hExcvhzdrJk_4 0 NOW SAY MY NAME IS FRED AND YOU SEE THAT THERE IS NO HES TRYING HARD HES TRYING HARD TO HOLD IT UP BUT HE CAN'T
hExcvhzdrJk_5 0 THERES NO LOCK THERE
hExcvhzdrJk_6 0 OK YOU CAN ALSO DO THINGS LIKE THIS
hExcvhzdrJk_7 0 SAY MY LIVER IS HEALTHY YES MY KIDNEYS ARE HEALTHY YES I HAVE NO CAVITIES
hExcvhzdrJk_8 0 SO YOU CAN HAVE GREAT FUN AT THIS WITH PARTIES
hExcvhzdrJk_9 0 ITS NOT ADMISSABLE IN COURT SO DON'T GO HOME AND TEST YOUR KIDS AND BEAT THEM IF IT DOESN'T TURN OUT RIGHT
hExcvhzdrJk_10 0 BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING IT WILL WORK
hExcvhzdrJk_11 0 IF YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU KNOW I HAVE THIS PAIN HERE
hExcvhzdrJk_12 0 I DON'T KNOW WHETHER ITS MY GALLBLADDER OR MY STOMACH
hExcvhzdrJk_13 0 YOU CAN SAY MY STOMACH IS FINE AND IF IT IS IT WILL BE STRONG AND IF IT ISN'T IT WILL GO DOWN AND YOU'LL KNOW THAT THE STOMACH PROBLEM
hExcvhzdrJk_14 0 IF NOT YOU GO TO THE NEXT THING MY GALLBLADDER IS FINE MY KIDNEY IS FINE I HAVE A PROBLEM HERE I HAVE A PROBLEM THERE
hExcvhzdrJk_15 0 WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOUR TRYING TO FIGURE OUT FOR YOURSELF YOU CAN FIND OUT BY MUSCLE TESTING AND USING YOUR BODY AS A LIE DETECTOR
H-IRLP0ouoE_1 0 CALAB LABARDA OH HI
H-IRLP0ouoE_2 0 MY NAME IS CALAB LABARDA I'M A THIRD DEGREE BLACK BELT IN TAEKWONDO
H-IRLP0ouoE_3 0 I'M HERE WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO USE SPEED CHUCKS
H-IRLP0ouoE_4 0 NOW WHEN DOING SPEED CHUCKS IT IS IMPORTANT TO CUT SOUNDS IT'S KIND OF SILLY BUT YOU DO ACTUALLY NEED TO WARM UP FOR IT ALRIGHT
H-IRLP0ouoE_5 0 AND IF YOUR EXERCISE IS TO WARM UP YOU'RE MOSTLY GOING TO BE WARMING UP YOUR WRIST CAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE THE PART OF YOUR BODY THAT'S GOING TO BE USING IT THE MOST AND YOUR FINGERS OKAY BELIEVE OR NOT
H-IRLP0ouoE_6 0 FOR SPEED CHUCKS YOU'RE GOING TO BE SPINNING THEM AROUND YOUR FINGERS AROUND YOUR THUMBS OKAY AROUND WRIST
H-IRLP0ouoE_7 0 SO I'VE ACTUALLY HURT MY WRIST BEFORE WHEN YOU START BUILDING UP SPEED AND GOING REALLY FAST
H-IRLP0ouoE_8 0 IF YOU DON'T WARM UP YOUR WRIST PROPERLY YOU CAN HURT THEM
H-IRLP0ouoE_9 0 SO GO AND TAKE YOUR NUNCHUCK
H-IRLP0ouoE_10 0 PUT IT ON ONE HAND AND JUST GO BACK AND FORTH
H-IRLP0ouoE_11 0 JUST REALLY LOOSEN IT UP
H-IRLP0ouoE_12 0 IT WILL GET YOUR ARM MOVING LOOSENS UP THE WHOLE UPPER BODY RIGHT HERE AND YOU SHOULD DO BOTH HANDS EVEN THOUGH WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE USING ONE TODAY
H-IRLP0ouoE_13 0 FOR BEGINNING NUNCHUCKS BEGINNING SPEED CHUCKS OKAY
H-IRLP0ouoE_14 0 I'LL GO AND JUST LOOSEN YOUR WRIST BECAUSE I LIKE TO GO UP AND DOWN IT'S KIND OF SILLY
H-IRLP0ouoE_15 0 GO UP AND DOWN LIKE THIS AND YOU CAN GO SIDE TO SIDE OKAY
H-IRLP0ouoE_16 0 JUST TAKE YOUR WRIST AND GO BACK AND FORTH LIKE THAT COME ALL THE WAY OUT AND STRETCH OUT YOUR FINGERS PUSHING EACH FINGER LIKE THAT A LITTLE BIT THAT MIGHT POP A LITTLE BIT
H-IRLP0ouoE_17 0 PUSH THEM BACK OVER
H-IRLP0ouoE_18 0 AND NOW FOR YOUR THUMBS GO TAKE YOUR THUMBS AND BEND BACK A LITTLE BIT STRETCH THEM OUT STRETCH THEM BOTH WAYS
H-IRLP0ouoE_19 0 DO BOTH HANDS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT OKAY
H-IRLP0ouoE_20 0 REALLY I REALLY STRETCH THOSE HANDS
H-IRLP0ouoE_21 0 YOU CAN EVEN USE THE GROUND AND SIT ON YOUR KNEES AND LEAN FORWARD TURN THEM AROUND LEAN BACKWARD STRETCH OUT YOUR WRIST AND THEN GO WRIST DOWN AND STRETCH OUT YOUR WRIST THAT WAY OKAY
H-IRLP0ouoE_22 0 AND THEN ONCE YOUR WRISTS ARE ALL WARMED UP WHERE WOULD THEY GO
H-IRLP0ouoE_23 0 WORK ON SOME SPEED CHUCKS
HFpzop3y4H4_1 0 HI I'M TY BROWN WITH DOGBEHVIORONLINE.COM
HFpzop3y4H4_2 0 I'M HERE IN RIVERTON UTAH TODAY TEACHING YOU HOW TO TRAIN A DOG
HFpzop3y4H4_3 0 THE TOPIC OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION IS TEACHING YOUR DOG HOW TO USE A DOGGIE DOOR
HFpzop3y4H4_4 0 NOW A LOT OF DOGS ARE A LITTLE BIT THREATENED BY THE CONCEPT OF A DOGGY DOOR BECAUSE ON FIRST GLANCE IT LOOKS LIKE JUST ANOTHER PART OF THE WALL AND SO TO TEACH YOUR DOG TO RUN INTO THAT PART OF THE WALL AND GO THROUGH CAN BE A LITTLE BIT DAUNTING AND SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS SET YOURSELF UP AND SET YOUR DOG UP FOR SUCCESS
HFpzop3y4H4_5 0 IN THE BEGINNING STAGES HAVE YOUR DOG WEAR A LEASH APPROACH THE DOOR AND GIVE HIM A COMMAND SUCH AS GO THROUGH OR GO POTTY OR SOME OTHER COMMAND LIKE THAT SO THAT THE DOG IS CUED TO DO SOMETHING
HFpzop3y4H4_6 0 ONCE YOU'VE SAID THAT USE THE LEASH TO IMPEL HIM THROUGH THE DOOR
HFpzop3y4H4_7 0 IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO JUST CONTINUE HELPING HIM
HFpzop3y4H4_8 0 IF HE REALLY DOESN'T WANT TO GO GET A PARTNER ON THE SIDE OF THAT DOOR TO HELP YOU
HFpzop3y4H4_9 0 PULL THE LEASH THROUGH AND HAVE THE PARTNER KIND OF GIVE A COUPLE TUGS SO THAT THE DOG COMES THROUGH
HFpzop3y4H4_10 0 ONCE HE MAKES IT THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE AT THAT POINT IT'S VERY CRITICAL THAT YOU REALLY MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD ABOUT HIS VICTORY
HFpzop3y4H4_11 0 GIVE HIM A TREAT GIVE HIM SOME PRAISE HELP HIM FEEL REALLY GOOD THAT HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE DOOR
HFpzop3y4H4_12 0 NOW IF YOU DO THIS WITH A LOT OF REPETITION THE DOG IS SOON GOING TO LEARN OH THAT DOGGIE DOOR ISN'T SO FEARFUL THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT AND HE'S GOING TO GO THROUGH ON HIS OWN
HFpzop3y4H4_13 0 BUT UNTIL YOU GET HIM TO THAT POINT YOU'VE GOT TO DO A LOT OF HELPING AND A LOT OF SHOWING SO THAT THE DOG CAN MAKE THE DECISION ON HIS OWN AND THAT'S HOW YOU TRAIN A DOG HOW TO USE THE DOGGIE DOOR
H2PCNz3X7yA_2 0 MY NAME IS HAROLD HALL FT LAUDERDALE ARCHERS IN FT LAUDERDALE FLORIDA AND TODAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT THAT YOU WOULD USE FOR ARCHERY
H2PCNz3X7yA_3 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME YOU
H2PCNz3X7yA_4 0 OKAY ONE OF THE ASPECTS THAT YOU NEED IS A GOOD TARGET
H2PCNz3X7yA_5 0 WE HAVE A TARGET FRAME HERE WHICH WAS BUILT OUT OF PRESSURE TREATED WOOD
H2PCNz3X7yA_6 0 IT HAS A LIGHT ON IT WHICH IS USED FOR NIGHT TIME
H2PCNz3X7yA_7 0 SO IF YOU COME OUT AND IT'S DARK AND YOU COULD SEE
H2PCNz3X7yA_8 0 SOME OF THE BACK STOP IS MADE OUT OF WHAT'S CALLED AN INSULATION MATERIAL WHICH IS USED FOR FLAT DECKS ON ROOFS THAT IS JUST ONE TYPE OF MATERIAL
H2PCNz3X7yA_9 0 YOU WOULD JUST PUT YOUR TARGETS ON THERE YOU HAVE WHAT IS CALLED TARGET PINS WHICH HOLDS YOUR PAPER ON
H2PCNz3X7yA_10 0 IT IS A PRETTY WELL CONSTRUCTED TARGET AS YOU COULD SEE THERE IS VARIES STYLES THAT YOU HAVE THAT HAVE A GOOD ROOF ON IT WHICH KEEPS THE WATER OFF FROM IT
H2PCNz3X7yA_11 0 YOU KNOW IT KEEPS IT DRY
Gv4uy35II0M_1 0 ANOTHER WAY TO DO SHADOWING ON YOUR DRAWING IS BY USING A VERY FINE TIPPED FELT PEN SO THIS EXAMPLE NOW WE'VE DRAWN IN OUR PLAYFUL CAT WITH SOME VERY BASIC COLORS AND I WANT TO ADD IN SOME SHADOWING SO BASICALLY WITH VERY VERY FINE LINES YOU CAN SEE THESE ARE REALLY SMALL VERY SMALL
Gv4uy35II0M_2 0 I TRACE ALONG THE BACK HERE AND YOU'RE GOING TO NOTICE VERY QUICKLY THAT THE DRAWING STARTS TO TAKE ON SOME MORE DEPTH SOME MORE WEIGHT THREE DIMENSIONAL ATTRIBUTES AS OPPOSED TO JUST HAVING THE GOOD BUT STILL ULTIMATELY QUICKLY SCRIGGLED ON LINES WE STARTED WITH
Gv4uy35II0M_3 0 CARTOONS LIKE OTHER FORMS OF DRAWINGS ARE STILL WORKS OF ART THAT YOU BUILD UP
Gv4uy35II0M_4 0 THERE ARE DIFFERENT LAYERS TO THEM
Gv4uy35II0M_5 0 THERE'S THE BASIC UNDER DRAWING
Gv4uy35II0M_6 0 THEN THERE'S ADDING ON COLOR SHAPE SHADOW SO IN THIS CASE LET'S HAVE THE SHADOW GO ALL AROUND THE BODY SO BRING IT UP OVER HERE ON THE PAWS
Gv4uy35II0M_7 0 NOW NOTICE HOW I DON'T TEND TO BRING THE SHADOW ALL THE WAY AROUND EVERYTHING
Gv4uy35II0M_8 0 I USUALLY FIND IT'S GOOD TO KIND OF PICK A SIDE UNLESS AN OBJECT IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN TOTAL DARKNESS SO KIND OF PICK A SIDE THAT YOU WANT THE SHADOW TO GO ALONG LIKE I'M DOING HERE
Gv4uy35II0M_9 0 YOU CAN EVEN SHADOW A LITTLE BIT OF THE WHISKER AREA TO GIVE YOUR CAT A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A SMILE THERE
Gv4uy35II0M_10 0 YOU CAN CATCH A LITTLE BIT OF A LINE
Gv4uy35II0M_11 0 NOW YOU CAN ALSO ADD SHADOWING TO THE BALL OF YARN
Gv4uy35II0M_12 0 YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE THIS A LITTLE MORE PRONOUNCED THAN YOUR CAT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER TO SEE SO UNDERNEATH HERE I'M GOING TO HAVE SOME SHADOWING GOING ON UNDERNEATH THE BALL ON THE UNDERSIDE BUT I'M NOT GOING TO EXTEND IT ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP SO EXPERIMENT HOWEVER YOU LIKE WITH THE SHADOWING
Gv4uy35II0M_13 0 THE BASIC THING TO REMEMBER IS A FINE FELT-TIPPED PEN CAN BE EXCELLENT FOR ADDING SHADOW AND DEPTH TO YOUR CAT CARTOONS OR ANY CARTOONS FOR THAT MATTER
GqgNoF6Ndr0_1 0 NOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS PUT THE BIKE ON THE FLOOR AND STAND OVER IT TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS WHERE I LIKE IT
GqgNoF6Ndr0_2 0 IN THIS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE I HAVE THE GRIP AND BRAKE LEVER ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HANDLE BARS I HAVE SOMETHING TO WORK WITH
GqgNoF6Ndr0_3 0 USUALLY THAT IS NOT THE CASE
GqgNoF6Ndr0_4 0 SO WHAT I DO IS I START OFF BY ADJUSTING MY GRIP WITH THESE LOCK ON STYLE GRIPS NOTICE I HAVE BOLT HEADS I WANT TO ADJUST IT WHERE THE BOLT HEADS ARE NOT ANYWHERE NEAR WHERE I'M GOING TO BE PUTTING MY HANDS CAUSE THAT IS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE
GqgNoF6Ndr0_5 0 SO I TAKE MY THREE MILLIMETER WRENCH OR A 2.5 MILLIMETER WRENCH IF YOU ARE USING THE ODI BRAND GRIPS
GqgNoF6Ndr0_6 0 TIGHTEN THIS TO A GOOD TORK I'M GOING TO TIGHTEN UP THE OTHER HEAD SO NOW I HAVE MY GRIPS INSTALL AND I'M READY TO SET UP MY BRAKE LEVER
GqgNoF6Ndr0_7 0 FOR ME BRAKE LEVER POSITIONING IS A LOT MORE CRITICAL THEN SHIFTERS POSITIONING BECAUSE BRAKES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOL YOU HAVE IN ARMS WHEN IT COMES TO CONTROLLING YOUR BIKE
GqgNoF6Ndr0_8 0 SO I LIKE TO SET THINGS UP SO I HAVE A NICE EVEN ANGLE DOWN MY HAND TO MY WRIST TO WRAP AROUND THE BRAKE LEVER I ALSO PERSONALLY LIKE TO BE ABLE TO READ CH THE BRAKE LEVER WHEN MY HAND IS ON THE HANDLEBARS LIKE THIS
GqgNoF6Ndr0_9 0 JUST ONE FINGER CAUSE THESE BRAKES ARE GOOD ENOUGH THAT I WON'T NEED MY WHOLE HAND TO BRAKE
GqgNoF6Ndr0_10 0 SOME PEOPLE PREFER TO USE TWO FINGERS OR OTHER FINGERS TO BRAKE AND THEY MAY END UP SLIDING THERE BRAKE LEVER OUT THIS WAY SO THAT IT IS MORE NATURAL TO HAVE THERE HAND ON THE END OF THE BAR PULL THE MIDDLE FINGER WITH TWO FINGERS BUT THAT IS NOT MY PREFERENCE
GqgNoF6Ndr0_11 0 SO I'M GOING TO FIND THE ANGLE IT FEELS GOOD THIS FEELS PRETTY GOOD SO I'M GOING TO HOLD THAT GRAB MY FOUR MILLIMETER WRENCH AND TIGHTEN THESE UP SORT OF FINGER TIGHT
GqgNoF6Ndr0_12 0 THIS IS A REALLY LIGHT APPLICATION YOUR STILL WANT TO BE ABLE TO REACH DOWN AND ADJUST THESE CAUSE THAT MEANS IF YOU CRASH THEY WOULD MOVE OUT OF THE WAY INSTEAD OF BRAKING
G9HKko_447Q_1 0 HI I'M KARINA FRALEY FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE ARE MAKING OUR PILLOW
G9HKko_447Q_2 0 SO WE'VE GONE AHEAD AND WE'VE CUT OUT OUR PILLOW AND NOW I'M GOING TO GIVE IT A ONCE OVER WITH MY IRON
G9HKko_447Q_3 0 WHICH IS FIRED UP AND READY TO GO BECAUSE I'M GOING TO NEED IT LATER ON TO USE WITH THE FUSIBLE TAPE
G9HKko_447Q_4 0 RIGHT NOW I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT OF AN IRON AND THEN ONCE WE STUFF IT IT'S GOING TO BE NICE AND SMOOTH
G9HKko_447Q_5 0 ALRIGHT SO NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS JUST PUT OUR RIGHT SIDES OF OUR FABRIC TOGETHER CAUSE THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO SEW THEM
G9HKko_447Q_6 0 THE WAY THAT YOU TELL WHAT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FABRIC IS IS THE BOLDER COLOR YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT THIS THE BACK YOU CAN SEE THE COLORS ARE NOT AS VIBRANT AND THIS IS THE FRONT
G9HKko_447Q_7 0 IT'S A LITTLE MORE OBVIOUS ON SOME FABRICS THAN ON OTHERS SO I'M SURE THOUGH THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHICH IS THE RIGHT SIDE

Hg129egkM9I_4 0 ON THIS COLOR CORRECTOR AGAIN YOU'VE GOT SOME OF YOUR BASICS
Hg129egkM9I_5 0 ONE OF THEM IS YOUR CURVE
Hg129egkM9I_6 0 YOU CAN GRAB YOUR CURVE AT ANY POINT AND PULL IT AND DOWN
Hg129egkM9I_7 0 NOW LIKE I SAY BE VERY REASONABLE WITH THIS
Hg129egkM9I_8 0 YOU CAN EITHER PULL IT DOWN REALLY DARK LIKE THIS OR YOU COULD PULL YOUR REDS UP
Hg129egkM9I_9 0 NOW IF YOU ARE SHOOTING A MUSIC VIDEO GO CRAZY
Hg129egkM9I_10 0 YOU CAN OVER SATURATE DO WHATEVER YOU WANT
Hg129egkM9I_11 0 IF YOU ARE SHOOTING SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE DRAMATIC OR A LITTLE MORE REALITY YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE NOT TO GO TOO OVER THE TOP WITH YOUR COLORS BUT THAT IS ENOUGH

H8RCWxhRUfM_1 0 SO THIS IS HOW I WOULD CONVINCE PEOPLE TO START TUTORING WITH ME OR MAYBE ANOTHER WAY OF WORDING IT WOULD BE HOW TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BE TUTORED
H8RCWxhRUfM_2 0 A COUPLE OF WAYS THAT I CAN THINK OF TO SELL MY TUTORING SERVICES WOULD BE WORKING FOR A COMPANY IN THE FIRST PLACE
H8RCWxhRUfM_3 0 THEY PRETTY MUCH DO THE SELLING FOR YOU
H8RCWxhRUfM_4 0 AND THEY CALL YOU UP AND THEY GOT YOU A CLIENT
H8RCWxhRUfM_5 0 ANOTHER ONE IS TO GO TO THE HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE JOB BOARD AND OFFER YOUR SERVICES THERE
H8RCWxhRUfM_6 0 OR JUST YOU KNOW POST UP A POST UP FLIERS WITH YOUR NUMBER AND INFORMATION AND YOU KNOW LITTLE TABS RIP OFF TABS OF WHAT YOU CAN TUTOR AND YOU KNOW ALL THE INFORMATION THAT ANY OF THE COLLEGE OR THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WILL NEED TO GET TUTORED BY YOU
H8RCWxhRUfM_7 0 THE BIGGEST ONE A BIG ONE PROBABLY THE BIGGEST ONE IS BY WORD OF MOUTH
H8RCWxhRUfM_8 0 PEOPLE YOU ARE ALREADY TUTORING WILL GENERALLY TALK TO THEIR FRIENDS AT SCHOOL OR THEIR PARENTS WILL TALK TO THE OTHER PARENTS AND SOMEHOW WORD OF MOUTH WILL TRAVEL THAT YOU ARE A DECENT SCIENCE TUTOR OR MATH TUTOR WHATEVER
H8RCWxhRUfM_9 0 AND USUALLY PEOPLE ARE MORE COMFORTABLE HIRING SOMEONE THAT HAS ALREADY TESTED THE TUTOR AS FAR AS STYLE OR YOU KNOW COMPATIBILITY WITH THEIR CHILD
H8RCWxhRUfM_10 0 SO YEAH A TESTED TUTOR TRAVELS BY WORD OF MOUTH PRETTY WELL
H8RCWxhRUfM_11 0 THAT IS HOW I WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO START A TUTORING PROGRAMS WITH ME

g-OJuZNN9oM_8 0 IN CHINESE MEDICINE THERE'S A DIAGNOSIS THAT WE USED TO CALLED BLOOD DEFICIENCYAND BLOOD DEFICIENCY DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE A QUART LOW IT JUST MEANS THAT THE BLOOD ISN'T AS STRONG AS IT SHOULD BE ISN'T CARRYING THE NUTRIENTS THE WAY IT SHOULD

g-OJuZNN9oM_14 0 BLOOD DEFICIENCY WHEN IT GETS TO AN EXTREME IS RECOGNIZED BY WESTERN MEDICINE AS ANEMIA
g-OJuZNN9oM_15 0 AT THAT POINT THE TEST THAT WESTERN MEDICINE USES THE NUMBERS THAT THEY LOOK AT WILL SAY HEY OKAY NOW WE HAVE ANEMIA
g-OJuZNN9oM_16 0 BUT AGAIN WE SEE BLOOD STARTING TO WEAKEN LONG BEFORE THINGS LIKE THAT HAPPEN

gNOe0UogfY0_2 0 PLANTS ARE LIKE YOU AND ME THEY HAVE TO EAT MORE THAN I DO PROBABLY BUT YOU NEED THOSE NUTRIENTS TO GET GOOD YIELDS ON THESE PLANTS REMEMBER VEGETABLES ARE VERY SHORT-TERM PLANTS
gNOe0UogfY0_3 0 I LIKE TO INCORPORATE GOOD AMOUNTS OF ORGANIC FERTILIZER AT THE INITIAL PLANTING
gNOe0UogfY0_4 0 NOW THE THREE NUMBERS ON A FERTILIZER IS NITROGEN PHOSPHORUS AND POTASSIUM ORGANIC FERTILIZERS TEND TO NOT BE AS HIGH AS INORGANIC CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS BUT AT INITIAL PLANTING INCORPORATE TWO TO THREE POUNDS TO VERY ONE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET OF A GOOD ORGANIC ANALYSIS INCORPORATE IT INTO THAT COMPOST AT THE INITIAL PLANTING BUT ONCE THOSE VEGETABLES GET GOING THEY GET HUNGRY
gNOe0UogfY0_5 0 SO YOU HAVE TO USE A HIGH ACCELERATED NITROGEN LIKE AN EIGHTEEN SIX TWELVE NINETEEN FIVE NINE OR 21 SEVEN FOURTEEN EVERY TWO TO THREE WEEKS THROUGHOUT THE GROWING SEASON JUST PUT IT ON THE SIDE OF THE PLANT AND WATER IT IN REAL WELL
gpccQOvjw6E_1 0 AS YOUR COMPUTER GETS OLDER YOU'RE PROBABLY STARTING TO NOTICE IT'S GETTING SLOWER
gpccQOvjw6E_2 0 WELL THAT'S MORE THAN LIKELY BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTER DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH MEMORY OR RAM TO KEEP UP WITH TODAYS APPLICATIONS
gpccQOvjw6E_3 0 HI I'M CHARLES STEWART JR AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH MEMORY OR RAM YOUR COMPUTER HAS

gpccQOvjw6E_6 0 AND THEN WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU GO DOWN TO PROPERTIES AND YOU SELECT PROPERTIES
gpccQOvjw6E_7 0 WELL WHEN PROPERTIES COMES UP THE FIRST THING IN THE GENERAL TAB IT HAS INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR COMPUTER
gpccQOvjw6E_8 0 AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S SAYING THAT I'M RUNNING AMD ATHLON XP 2800
gpccQOvjw6E_9 0 AND THEN RIGHT UNDER THAT IT SAYS I'M RUNNING TWO HUN TWO GIGS OF RAM
gpccQOvjw6E_10 0 SO VERY SIMPLE SHOWING ME HOW MUCH RAM I HAVE ON MY COMPUTER
gpccQOvjw6E_11 0 ANOTHER WAY WOULD BE TO ACTUALLY OPEN UP THE CASE IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW MANY RAM MODULES YOU HAVE
gpccQOvjw6E_12 0 YOU COULD OPEN UP YOUR CASE AND THEN INSPECT THAT AND SEE HOW MANY RAM MODULES IF YOU'RE LOOKING BECAUSE YOU WANT TO UPGRADE YOUR RAM THE RAM AND THE OR MEMORY IN YOUR COMPUTER

GtDKp0W6Y9U_1 0 THIS IS THE PALOMAR KNOT
GtDKp0W6Y9U_2 0 AND THE PALOMAR KNOT IS CLAIMED TO BE A REALLY GREAT KNOT BECAUSE ITS NINETY-FIVE TO A HUNDRED PERCENT EFFICIENT
GtDKp0W6Y9U_3 0 USUALLY WHEN YOU PUT A KNOT IN A ROPE YOU REDUCE THE STRENGTH OF YOUR ROPE
GtDKp0W6Y9U_4 0 SO IF YOUR ROPE STRENGTH IS FIVE-HUNDRED POUNDS ONCE YOU PUT A KNOT IN IT YOU ARE GOING TO REDUCE IT USUALLY BY FIFTY-FIVE TO SEVENTY-FIVE PERCENT
GtDKp0W6Y9U_5 0 SOMEWHERE IN THERE UNLESS YOU'RE USING A BLOOD KNOT

GtDKp0W6Y9U_13 0 AND AS I PULL IT DOWN THIS CREATES SOMETHING THAT IS VERY VERY SIMILAR TO A BLOOD KNOT
GtDKp0W6Y9U_14 0 YOUR PALOMAR KNOT
G8epH7ZFIlM_1 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE HOOK THAT WILL CLOSE YOUR BEAUTIFUL NECKLACE CLASP

GcfatSmNHfU_2 0 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN USING THE CAKE MOLD LIKE THIS OR A BUNDT PAN TO GREASE IT WELL AND THEN LIGHTLY FLOUR IT
GcfatSmNHfU_3 0 SO YOU WANT TO USE EITHER A PAN SPRAY LIKE THIS AND REALLY PUT A NICE COATING ON THERE
GcfatSmNHfU_4 0 AND IF YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF A CENTER THING THIS HAS A LITTLE CENTER TUBE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT GETS THOROUGHLY GREASED ALSO

GcfatSmNHfU_6 0 WHEN YOU FILL IT WITH BATTER I FILLED MY PAN ABOUT THIS HIGH AND IT TOOK OVER AN HOUR TO COOK
GcfatSmNHfU_7 0 SO IF YOU FILL IT MUCH HIGHER IT'LL COME UP HERE AND IT'LL TAKE A LONG TIME TO COOK

gM6tndOzWsU_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM MY NAME IS DON WITH FRIENDLY COMPUTER'S AND I'M HERE TO TALK TODAY ABOUT BUYING A USED COMPUTER
gM6tndOzWsU_2 0 NOW WHETHER IT'S A LAPTOP OR A DESKTOP AS WE SAID IN THE SEVERAL OF THE PREVIOUS SEGMENTS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TURN THE MACHINE ON TO SEE HOW IT WORKS AND TO SEE WHAT'S ON IT
gM6tndOzWsU_3 0 WE'VE MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES THAT THERE'S IMPORTANT FEATURES THAT YOU NEED TO DECIDE ON BUT NOW MOST USERS MIGHT SAY HOW DO I FIND OUT IF THE MACHINE HAS THOSE THINGS
gM6tndOzWsU_4 0 I KNOW I NEED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MEMORY I KNOW I NEED A CERTAIN CPU I KNOW I NEED CERTAIN THINGS BUT HOW DO I FIND OUT IF THOSE THINGS ARE THERE AND FUNCTIONAL
gM6tndOzWsU_5 0 START WITH WHERE THERE'S A PLACE WHERE THERE'S POWER WHERE THERE'S A MONITOR A KEYBOARD AND A MOUSE AVAILABLE
gM6tndOzWsU_6 0 HOPEFULLY THE OWNER OF THE MACHINE THAT'S SELLING IT FOR YOU WILL HAVE IT ALL AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT
gM6tndOzWsU_7 0 TURN IT ON MAKE SURE IT COMES UP WITHOUT ANY ERRORS
gM6tndOzWsU_8 0 ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE MACHINE TURNED ON ASSUMING IT'S WINDOWS XP SIMPLY FIND MY COMPUTER IN THE START MENU RIGHT CLICK ON THAT ICON AND CHOOSE PROPERTIES
gM6tndOzWsU_9 0 THE FIRST SCREEN THAT COMES UP SHOWS YOU WHAT THE SYSTEM HAS AS FAR AS MEMORY WHAT LEVEL OF XP IS ON IT AS WELL AS WHAT CPU IT HAS
gM6tndOzWsU_10 0 THEN IF YOU CLICK ON THE HARDWARE TAB AND CHOOSE THE VICE MANAGER IT WILL NOW OPEN UP AN ENTIRE SCREEN THAT SHOWS ALL OF THE RECOGNIZE AND UNRECOGNIZED DEVICES ON THAT COMPUTER
gM6tndOzWsU_11 0 OTHER THAN THAT YOU CAN CHECK THE HARD DISK SIZE AND YOU CAN CHECK THE SPEED OF THAT IT BOOTS UP AND HOW IT SEEMS TO RUN
gM6tndOzWsU_12 0 DOES IT SEEM TO RUN AT AN ACCEPTABLE SPEED TO YOU
gM6tndOzWsU_13 0 NOW ONCE YOU'VE FOUND ALL THOSE THINGS OUT AND IT RUNS FAIRLY DECENTLY AND SEEMS OKAY NOW YOU'VE MADE THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS DECIDING TO PURCHASE IT
gM6tndOzWsU_14 0 HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH
gM6tndOzWsU_15 0 THAT'S DIFFERENT IN EVERY MARKET AND THAT'S ANYBODY'S GUESS
gM6tndOzWsU_16 0 SO IF I WERE TO SAY WITH NEW COMPUTERS STARTING IN THE $500 RANGE UNLESS IT'S A REAL HIGH END MACHINE YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN THAT
gM6tndOzWsU_17 0 NOW ANOTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS DOES THE PLACE YOU'RE BUYING IT GOING TO GIVE TO BACK IT OR GIVE WARRANTY THAT'S WORTH A LITTLE EXTRA TOO BECAUSE ANY USED COMPUTER IS JUST WAITING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO FAIL
gM6tndOzWsU_18 0 SO JUST BE CAREFUL AS ANYTHING WHEN YOU'RE BUYING SOMETHING USED CHECK IT OUT KICK THE TIRE SORT OF SPEAK MAKE SURE IT TURNS ON OKAY AND THEN VERIFY THAT IT HAS THOSE THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO SEE
GpiWcbw1LHI_1 0 ANOTHER OPTION FOR FINISHES IS TO USE A WALNUT OIL
GpiWcbw1LHI_2 0 THIS ISN'T THE SAME KIND OF WALNUT OIL THAT YOU MIGHT FIND SITTING ON YOUR GROCERY SHELF
GpiWcbw1LHI_3 0 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS IS THIS IS A HEAT TREATED AND FILTERED WALNUT OIL THAT IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO BE PUT ON WOOD UTENSILS AND UTILITARIAN ITEMS LIKE WOOD BOWLS
GpiWcbw1LHI_4 0 IT'S VERY SIMPLE TO PUT ON AND AGAIN YOU CAN PUT THIS FINISH ON THE BOWL EITHER ON THE LATHE OR OFF THE LATHE
GpiWcbw1LHI_5 0 BUT BECAUSE THIS BOWL I TURNED AWAY THE FOOT AND WE HAVE A COMPLETELY ROUNDED BOTTOM I HAVE NO WAY TO HOLD THE BOWL SO WE'RE GOING TO DO IT THIS WAY
GpiWcbw1LHI_6 0 YOU PUT A LITTLE BIT OF THE WALNUT OIL ON THE BOWL AND YOU EVENLY SPREAD IT USING THIS SOFT CLOTH
GpiWcbw1LHI_7 0 AND YOU REALLY WANT TO SATURATE THE BOWL
GpiWcbw1LHI_8 0 AND YOU'LL KNOW THAT IT'S NOT SATURATED BECAUSE AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES OF LOOKING AT THE WOOD YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT THE BOWL LOOKS DRY
GpiWcbw1LHI_9 0 AND WHEN YOU HAVE THAT YOU WANT TO PUT SOME MORE OF THAT OIL BACK ON THE PIECE AND KEEP APPLYING IT
GpiWcbw1LHI_10 0 IN YOUR FIRST APPLICATION THAT YOU DO LIKE THIS YOU WANT TO GIVE IT A GOOD TEN MINUTES TO SOAK IN BEFORE YOU WALK AWAY
GpiWcbw1LHI_11 0 AND THEN YOU LET IT REST ON THE LITTLE BASE AND STAND THERE

H9s0RttOwwI_1 0 HI MY NAME IS DOUGLAS WILLOT ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
H9s0RttOwwI_2 0 AND TODAY WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT SHOPPING FOR SHOES ONLINE
H9s0RttOwwI_3 0 THERE IS A SHOPPING TECHNIQUE YOU CAN DO WHEN YOU DO ONLINE SHOPPING WHERE YOU LOOK SOMETHING UP ON A STORE SITE IF YOU FIND A PRODUCT THAT YOU LIKE YOU THEN YOU GO TO THE MANUFACTURER'S SITE AND YOU SEE IF THE MANUFACTURER WILL SELL IT TO YOU DIRECTLY FROM THEIR WAREHOUSE FOR LESS
H9s0RttOwwI_4 0 WITH SHOES THIS IS HIT AND MISS THERE'S A LOT OF TIMES THAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO FIND A BETTER PRICE ON A SHOE ON A STORE SITE THAN YOU WOULD ON A MANUFACTURER'S SENDING IT TO YOU DIRECTLY
H9s0RttOwwI_5 0 THERE WILL BE OTHER TIMES THOUGH WHERE THE MANUFACTURER'S GOING TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT DISCOUNT AS OPPOSED TO WHAT YOU WOULD PAY FROM A TRUSTED ONLINE RETAILER
H9s0RttOwwI_6 0 FOR INSTANCE I LOOKED UP A SHOE I AM INTERESTED IN PURCHASING HERE ON A VERY POPULAR ONLINE RETAIL SITE IT IS $170 ALMOST BUT DIRECT FROM THE MANUFACTURER'S IS AT $120
H9s0RttOwwI_7 0 I BET YOU I CAN FIND IT EVEN CHEAPER THAN THAT IF I LOOK HARD ENOUGH DEPENDING ON HOW NEW THE SHOE IS
H9s0RttOwwI_8 0 A NEWER SHOE OFTEN IS ONLY AVAILABLE ON THE MANUFACTURER'S SITE AND MAYBE ONE OR TWO OF THEIR PREFERED RETAILERS BUT THE OLDER THE SHOE GETS THE MORE LIKELY YOUR GOING TO FIND IT ON A RETAILER'S SITE FOR CHEAPER THAN YOU WOULD ON A MANUFACTURER'S
H9s0RttOwwI_9 0 AND IN SOME CASE THE MANUFACTURER'S STOP SELLING THAT SHOE ALL TOGETHER FOR INSTANCE THIS PAIR I CAN STILL GET ON A POPULAR RETAIL SITE BUT WHEN I WENT STRAIGHT TO THE MANUFACTURER'S SITE TO SEE IF I CAN GET IT CHEAPER THEY WEREN'T SELLING IT ANYMORE
H31OrqijDXE_1 0 FROM POSITION SIX WHICH IS A CLOSED HIP POSITION WE CAN GO RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS SUNSALUTE TO A BALANCING POSE JUST FOR FUN

hCOPDugNHTU_1 0 THIS NEXT STYLE OF HAT IS CALLED A TAM O SHANTER BUT YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD OF IT CALLED A TAM
hCOPDugNHTU_2 0 THAT'S JUST THE TECHNICAL TERM IS A TAM O SHANTER THAT IS THAT'S IS A NICKNAME IS THE TAM
hCOPDugNHTU_3 0 IT'S A SCOTTISH HAT
hCOPDugNHTU_4 0 IT'S GOT A LITTLE POOF ON IT A LITTLE COTTON BALLY POOF AT THE TOP LIKE A BEANY
hCOPDugNHTU_5 0 THIS YOU WEAR WITH YOUR KILT
hCOPDugNHTU_6 0 SINCE WE ALL WEAR KILTS DEFINITELY YOU HAVE TO ADD THIS IN
hCOPDugNHTU_7 0 OR WITH YOUR LITTLE BLOOMER KNICKERS GOLF PANTS AND ARGYLE SOCKS AND ARGYLE SWEATER
hCOPDugNHTU_8 0 THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN ADD THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY LIKE THE EASIEST THING TO DRAW JUST BECAUSE IT REALLY HAS NO SHAPE
hCOPDugNHTU_9 0 BUT IF YOU DO IT LIKE THIS IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO GIVE AN EMPHASIS OF GOLFING TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC
hCOPDugNHTU_10 0 IT'S GOING TO BE MORE OF A ADDED STATEMENT PIECE
hCOPDugNHTU_11 0 AND THEN JUST REMEMBER WHEN YOU'RE DRAWING IT THAT IT HAS THE FITTED PART AROUND THE HEAD THAT IS PULLED DOWN
hCOPDugNHTU_12 0 AND YOU WILL SINCE YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO SHOW MOTION IN TWO IN TWO-D THAT'S WHY THIS IS EXAGGERATED
hCOPDugNHTU_13 0 THAT'S WHY THIS HAT FOLDS DOWN
hCOPDugNHTU_14 0 I HAVE IT FOLDED DOWN OVER THE FACE BECAUSE THIS IS HOW IT'S IT'S SO BIG AND FLOPPY
hCOPDugNHTU_15 0 THAT'S HOW IT'S GOING TO FALL
hCOPDugNHTU_16 0 SO AND THEN MAKE SURE TO DRAW THE LITTLE BUNNY TAIL POOF BALL POMPOM
hCOPDugNHTU_17 0 POMPOM GOLLY THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED
hCOPDugNHTU_18 0 MAKE SURE YOU DRAW THE POMPOM AT THE TOP
hCOPDugNHTU_19 0 AND I PUT IT IN PLAID JUST TO REINFORCE THE WHOLE SCOTTISH THING
_gBJRqR36fo_1 0 ALL RIGHT THE FIRST THING THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR SHRIMP AND REMOVE OUR SHELLS
_gBJRqR36fo_2 0 SO I'VE PLACED THE SHRIMP ON THIS PLATE SO THAT CAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE USING THIS CUTTING BOARD AFTERWARDS SO I DON'T HAVE TO GO AND CLEAN THE CUTTING BOARD SO IT WON'T CONTAMINATE ANYTHING ELSE
_gBJRqR36fo_3 0 I'VE ALSO BROUGHT THIS LITTLE BOWL HERE SO THAT WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH OUR SHELLS WE CAN PUT THEM HERE AND PUT THEM STRAIGHT INTO THE SINK AND THEN THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CONTAMINATE ANYTHING ELSE
_gBJRqR36fo_4 0 AND TO FURTHER ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO CROSS-CONTAMINATION I'M GOING TO PUT ON A PAIR OF GLOVES
_gBJRqR36fo_5 0 AND THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS TO PEEL SHRIMP
_gBJRqR36fo_6 0 SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO TAKE THE LEGS AND PULL THOSE OFF FIRST
_gBJRqR36fo_7 0 THAT WILL REMOVE MOST OF THE SHELL AND THEN THEY'LL GRAB THE TOP AND TAKE THE TAIL OFF
_gBJRqR36fo_8 0 SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO LEAVE THE TAIL ON AND THAT'S SPECIALLY GOOD IF YOU'RE POACHING SHRIMP AND THEN CHILLING IT SO PEOPLE HAVE SOMETHING TO GRAB ON TO DIP INTO
_gBJRqR36fo_9 0 BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE SAUTEING THEM
_gBJRqR36fo_10 0 SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO START AT THE BACK AND PEEL ACROSS THIS WAY AND THEN PULL THE SHRIMP OUT
_gBJRqR36fo_11 0 AND AGAIN THE TAILPIECE WILL STAY ON SO WE'LL JUST GRAB AND TAKE THAT OFF
_gBJRqR36fo_12 0 SOME PEOPLE JUST GRAB AND PULL
_gBJRqR36fo_13 0 THAT METHOD ALSO WORKS
_gBJRqR36fo_14 0 SOME PEOPLE WILL START WITH ONE SIDE AND THEN MOVE OVER AND TAKE THE OTHER SIDE
_gBJRqR36fo_15 0 AND AS YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THESE METHODS WORK
_gBJRqR36fo_16 0 THERE'S NOT ONE WAY THAT WORKS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER
_gBJRqR36fo_17 0 THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU GET ALL OF THE SHELLS OFF
_gBJRqR36fo_18 0 AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE PEELING YOUR SHRIMP YOU WANT TO TURN THEM OVER AND LOOK AT THIS BACK SIDE
_gBJRqR36fo_19 0 IF YOU SEE ANY BROWN OR BLACK IN THERE YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND CLEAN THEM OUT
_gBJRqR36fo_20 0 BUT WITH ALL OF THESE SHRIMP WE WERE LUCKY AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THOSE
go2LNo0eSlQ_2 0 WE ARE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THROWING THE BASEBALL
go2LNo0eSlQ_3 0 IF YOU ARE A PITCHER YOU WANT THE BALL TO SINK YOU WANT IT TO SAIL YOU WANT TO DART YOU WANT IT TO DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS MAKES IT TOUGHER FOR THE BATTER TO HIT
go2LNo0eSlQ_4 0 ON THE FLIP SIDE WHEN YOU THROW A BASEBALL TO ONE OF YOUR TEAM MATES YOU WANT IT TO BE AS STRAIGHT AND TRUE AS POSSIBLE YOU DON'T THE BALL TO STEPPING AND DARTING AND TO DO THAT YOU WANT TO GET THE PROPER FORESEAM GRIP
go2LNo0eSlQ_5 0 HERE'S THE PROPER GRIP WHEN YOU THROW THE BALL THUMB TUCKED UNDER AND THE REASON BEING WHEN YOU THROW THE BALL AND IT COMES OUT OF YOUR FINGERS YOU HAVE FOUR SEAMS BREAKING AIR IT WILL TEND TO STAY STRAIGHTER THAN IF YOU THREW THE BALL THIS WAY WHERE THE SEAMS MAY MAKE IT SINK
go2LNo0eSlQ_6 0 SO YOU WANT TO MAKE IT AS EASY TO THROW AS POSSIBLE FOR FIELDER
go2LNo0eSlQ_7 0 SO YOU WANT TO THROW ACROSS THE SEAMS

go2LNo0eSlQ_9 0 TAKE YOUR GLOVE JUST THROW THE BALL IN CHAIR PULL IT OUT AND GET THE PROPER GRIP
go2LNo0eSlQ_10 0 IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH AT FIRST BUT WHEN YOU DO THIS A FEW HUNDRED TIMES PRETTY SOON EVERY TIME YOU REACH INTO THAT GLOVE YOU ARE GOING TO PULL THAT BASEBALL OUT WITH THE PROPER GRIP
go2LNo0eSlQ_12 0 SO YOU CAN DO THAT AT HOME
go2LNo0eSlQ_13 0 JUST DON'T MISS THE GLOVE BECAUSE THEN MOM WILL REALLY BE MAD
go2LNo0eSlQ_14 0 BUT ANYWAY THROW THE BALL INTO THE GLOVE PULL IT OUT WITH THE PROPER GRIP
go2LNo0eSlQ_15 0 AGAIN FOUR SEAM GRIP
go2LNo0eSlQ_16 0 WHEN YOU ARE IN THE OUTFIELD YOU WANT TO COME OVER THE TOP AND MAKE A STRONG TRUE THROW

go2LNo0eSlQ_18 0 HERE COMES A THROW
go2LNo0eSlQ_19 0 PULL IT OUT FOUR SEAM GRIP RIGHT THERE
go2LNo0eSlQ_20 0 AND WORK ON GETTING THE BALL OUT OF THE GLOVE QUICK FOUR SEAM GRIP
go2LNo0eSlQ_21 0 IT ALWAYS HELPS TO CATCH WITH TWO HANDS
GEUQjTIpnmA_1 0 THE NEXT STEP IS STARTING TO SKETCH ON OUR CANVAS
GEUQjTIpnmA_2 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE PHOTOGRAPH THAT WE HAVE SELECTED FOR INSPIRATION TODAY AND WE'RE GOING TO TACK THIS UP HERE ON THE TOP OF OUR EASEL SET FOR THE NICE PUSH PIN UP HERE
GEUQjTIpnmA_3 0 AND NOW ONCE THIS PHOTOGRAPH IS UP HERE WE'RE GOING TO START TO SKETCH ON OUR CANVAS
GEUQjTIpnmA_4 0 NOW WHAT YOU MAY BE ASKING IS WELL THEY'RE REALLY ARE NO ACTUAL OBJECTS YOU'RE JUST SOME CLOUDS MAYBE THE MOUNTAINS I CAN SKETCH IN WHY SHOULD I SKETCH ANYTHING ELSE IN
GEUQjTIpnmA_5 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO BE SKETCHING IN HERE IS THE BORDER OF COLORS TO KIND OF GIVE YOURSELF A GUIDE AS YOU'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING IN SOME OF THESE PIGMENTS ON THE CANVAS
GEUQjTIpnmA_6 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO START OFF UP HERE AT THE TOP WHERE SOME OF THAT LIGHT PINK
GEUQjTIpnmA_7 0 WE'RE JUST GOING TO VERY LIGHTLY TRACE IN SOME OF THESE MAIN SOME OF THESE MAIN COLOR BANDS AND AREAS TO KIND OF GET SOME OF THAT SHAPE DOWN
GEUQjTIpnmA_8 0 AND LITERALLY SOMEONE IS EVEN JUST ONLY PUTTING IN A LITTLE LINE OF WHERE SOME OF THESE COLORS ARE GOING
GEUQjTIpnmA_9 0 AND THINGS FLYING OUT DOWN HERE TOWARDS THE BOTTOM
GEUQjTIpnmA_10 0 AND THEN OF COURSE THE EASIER PART WE HAVE OUR MOUNTAINS STICKING UP OVER HERE
GEUQjTIpnmA_11 0 JUST GOING TO TRACE THESE DOWN ACROSS THE BOTTOM
GEUQjTIpnmA_12 0 NOW I'M NOT MAKING THESE LINES VERY DARK
GEUQjTIpnmA_13 0 THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE
GEUQjTIpnmA_14 0 IN FACT YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO BE TOO DARK
GEUQjTIpnmA_15 0 I EVEN LIKE TO BLOW A BIT TO GET SOME OF THOSE CHARCOAL FRAGMENTS OFF OF MY CANVAS
GEUQjTIpnmA_16 0 BECAUSE NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE PAINTING OVER THIS AND WE DON'T WANT THE CHARCOAL TO MUDDY IT
GEUQjTIpnmA_17 0 AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH AFTER YOU'RE DONE PAINTING THE CHARCOAL WILL NOT SHOW THROUGH LIKE SOME OTHER THINGS LIKE PENCIL WILL
gBfs4UNJF0w_1 0 PINCH HITTING CAN BE ANYONE'S RESPONSIBILITY
gBfs4UNJF0w_2 0 ANYONE WHO IS NOT ACTIVELY IN THE GAME OR INCLUDED ON THE LINEUP CARD CAN BE A PINCH HITTER
gBfs4UNJF0w_3 0 THE PINCH HITTER CAN BE EXPECTED TO BUNT HE CAN BE EXPECTED TO HIT A HOME RUN HE CAN BE EXPECTED TO WALK
gBfs4UNJF0w_4 0 HE BASICALLY SUBSTITUTES FOR HITTERS IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS
gBfs4UNJF0w_5 0 FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A LEFT HANDER BATTER IN AGAINST A LEFT HANDER PITCHER YOU MAY WANT TO PINCH HIT A RIGHT HANDER PINCH HITTER TO PLAY THE NUMBERS
gBfs4UNJF0w_6 0 GENERALLY RIGHT HANDERS WILL HAVE A BETTER BATTING AVERAGE IN THAT SITUATION
gBfs4UNJF0w_7 0 SO PINCH HITTING CAN BE EVERYONE'S RESPONSIBILITY
gBfs4UNJF0w_8 0 YOUR MAIN JOB IS TO COME INTO THE GAME COLD AND GET A HIT
gBfs4UNJF0w_9 0 SOMETIMES PINCH HITTERS WILL BE SPECIALIZED
gBfs4UNJF0w_10 0 THEY'LL BE BROUGHT INTO THE GAME TO BUNT TO GET SACRIFICE FLIES OR SACRIFICE BUNTS THINGS LIKE THAT
gBfs4UNJF0w_11 0 GENERALLY EVERYONE WILL BE ASKED TO BE A PINCH HITTER
gBfs4UNJF0w_12 0 EVERYONE WILL BE ASKED TO BE A PINCH HITTER AT SOME POINT OR ANOTHER
gBfs4UNJF0w_13 0 EVEN YOUR BIG HITTERS LIKE GARY SHEFFIELD CHIPPER JONES ANDREW JONES BARRY BONDS ARE PINCH HITTERS
gBfs4UNJF0w_14 0 IF THEY DON'T START THE GAME THEY'LL STILL BE EXPECTED TO BE ON THE BENCH AND BE READY TO BE CALLED UPON LATER IN THE GAME IF THEIR TEAM NEEDS THEM
gBfs4UNJF0w_15 0 SO PINCH HITTER IS ANOTHER TYPE OF BACK UP PLAYER THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO A TEAM'S SUCCESS
gBfs4UNJF0w_16 0 YOU HAVE TO HAVE A GOOD STRONG BENCH IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL ESPECIALLY AT THE MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL LEVEL
GmXl58gLCLw_1 0 SEE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO FIT A HALTI

GmXl58gLCLw_15 0 THIS HAS GOT A LITTLE BIT MORE LEEWAY THAN OTHER PRODUCTS
GmXl58gLCLw_16 0 THIS ONE YOU CAN ACTUALLY CLOSE THEIR MOUTH IF YOU PULL IT FROM THE BOTTOM
GmXl58gLCLw_17 0 THEY USE THESE IN AGGRESSION CASES AT TIMES BECAUSE WE CAN ACTUALLY CLOSE THEIR MOUTH WITH THIS ONE
GmXl58gLCLw_18 0 THE WAY YOU WOULD HOOK IT UP TO THE LEASH IS RIGHT ON THE BOTTOM
gGVyf505pu8_1 0 HIP ROLLS IS AN EXERCISE THAT WORKS THE SPINE IN THE OPPOSITE WAY
gGVyf505pu8_2 0 AND IF YOU USUALLY HAVE SOMETHING UNDER YOUR HEAD SO THAT YOUR CHIN STARTS IN A CHIN TUCK POSITION GO AHEAD AND REMOVE THAT NOW
gGVyf505pu8_3 0 BRING YOUR FEET HIP DISTANCE APART YOUR HANDS ARE DOWN BY YOUR SIDE AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A NICE INHALE AND EXHALE ROCK THAT PELVIS BACK SO THAT THE LOWER BACK IS PRESSED INTO THE MAT AND FROM THERE KEEP PRESSING THE SPINE INTO THE MAT UNTIL YOU COME ALL THE WAY UP

gGVyf505pu8_6 0 SO THIS IS A NICE WAY TO STRETCH OUT THE SPINE
gGVyf505pu8_7 0 INHALE AND EXHALE ROTATE THAT PELVIS ALL THE WAY BACK PUSH THROUGH THAT LOWER BACK COMING ALL THE WAY UP CLOSING THE RIBCAGE TO DO SO SQUEEZING THE GLUTES

gGVyf505pu8_15 0 INHALE RELEASE AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND EXHALE AND CURL ALL THE WAY DOWN RELEASING THE PELVIS AT THE END
gGVyf505pu8_16 0 IF YOU FIND THAT WHEN YOU'RE DOING A HIP ROLL THAT YOU'RE TAKING SOME TENSION IN YOUR NECK JUST GENTLY ROCK YOUR HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE
gGVyf505pu8_17 0 JUST REMIND YOUR HEAD THAT IT'S NOT AT ALL ATTACHED TO YOUR ABDOMINALS

Geukv1_RQsI_8 0 IT TAKES A LOT MORE TIME TO HAND PRINT CERTAINLY BUT BY HAND PRINTING YOU CAN MAKE IT AS LARGE AS YOU WANT TO
Geukv1_RQsI_9 0 HERE IN THIS IMAGE THERE'S AN IMAGE OF A RUNNING ANGEL THAT HAS BEEN PRINTED WITH SEVERAL LAYERS OF INK ONTO THIS PIECE OF VERY THIN JAPANESE PAPER HERE
HFMeGY9PmBw_1 0 HI I'M STEVE MUNOZ WITH DUNCAN BUSINESS MACHINES AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO DIAL OUT TO TRY AND FAX MACHINE TO A CERTAIN COUNTRY OVERSEAS LETS SAY
HFMeGY9PmBw_2 0 PUT YOUR PAPER IN AND FIRST OFF YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOUR CARRIER HAS THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR PLAN A LONG DISTANCE PLAN TO CALL OVERSEAS AND IF YOU DO THEN YOU WOULD DIAL A COUNTRY CODE
HFMeGY9PmBw_3 0 EVERY COUNTRY HAS A CODE
HFMeGY9PmBw_4 0 SO YOU WOULD DIAL THAT CODE PAUSE FOR A SECOND AND THEN YOU WOULD DIAL THE NUMBER THAT YOU'RE SENDING TO AND THEN YOU WOULD PRESS START AND IT SHOULD GO
HFMeGY9PmBw_5 0 IT WILL TAKE A LITTLE TIME BECAUSE IT IS GOING OVERSEAS BUT IT WILL GET THERE AND IF YOU PUT CONFIRMATION ON YOU'LL GET CONFIRMATION WHETHER IT WENT OR NOT AND THAT'S HOW YOU DIAL OVERSEAS
Hfh2d_K94HU_1 0 JOE WILES HELLO AND HELLO THIS IS JOE WILES WITH THE ROCK AND ROLL CONSERVATORY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
Hfh2d_K94HU_2 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FOO FIGHTERS LEARN TO FLY
Hfh2d_K94HU_3 0 LET'S GO TO THE GUITAR
Hfh2d_K94HU_4 0 THE RIFF STARTS OUT WITH A SLIDE DOWN FROM I DON'T KNOW FROM ABOUT THE 15TH FRET OF THE LOW E STRING NOTHING TO IT JUST A SLIDE DOWN
Hfh2d_K94HU_5 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO USE A TECHNIQUE CALLED OCTAVING
Hfh2d_K94HU_6 0 IT'S KIND OF LIKE A POWER CHORD LIKE THIS
Hfh2d_K94HU_7 0 IN THIS CASE WE'RE GOING TO USE THE SECOND FRET OF THE A STRING THE FOURTH FRET OH WE WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT MIDDLE ONE BECAUSE IT'S AN OCTAVE
Hfh2d_K94HU_8 0 WE DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT ONE
Hfh2d_K94HU_9 0 WE MUTE IT OUT WITH OUR INDEX FINGER
Hfh2d_K94HU_10 0 BUT WE STILL KEEP OUR PINKY ON THE FOURTH FRET OF THIS G STRING
Hfh2d_K94HU_11 0 NOW IF I HIT ALL THESE THREE TOGETHER IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS
Hfh2d_K94HU_12 0 HEAR HOW THAT MIDDLE ONE'S MUTED OUT
Hfh2d_K94HU_13 0 IF I HIT ALL THREE I GET AN OCTAVE
Hfh2d_K94HU_14 0 THIS IS THE LOW OCTAVE AND THIS IS THE HIGH OCTAVE
Hfh2d_K94HU_15 0 THEY'RE THE SAME NOTE AN OCTAVE APART
Hfh2d_K94HU_16 0 THAT'S MY GOAL WITH THIS RIFF
Hfh2d_K94HU_17 0 I'M GOING TO GO TWO AND FOUR A STRING AND G STRING SLIDE IT UP TWO WHICH IS FOUR AND SIX A STRING AND G STRING AND I'M GOING TO BEND IT AND THEN I'M GOING TO SLIDE IT BACK DOWN OKAY
Hfh2d_K94HU_18 0 TO END OFF THIS RIFF I'M GOING TO BRING MY INDEX FINGER DOWN AND PAD THE SECOND FRET OF THE D STRING HERE
Hfh2d_K94HU_19 0 AND AT THE HIGH TWO STRINGS RING OUT OKAY
Hfh2d_K94HU_20 0 SO THIS CHORD IS TWO ON THE A STRING SECOND FRET ON THE D STRING BOTH PADDED WITH MY INDEX FINGER FOURTH FRET OF THE G STRING WHICH IS MY PINKY AND THEN THESE HIGH TWO ARE JUST RINGING OUT WIDE OPEN
Hfh2d_K94HU_21 0 SLOWLY THIS RIFF SOUNDS LIKE THIS
Hfh2d_K94HU_22 0 THAT OCTAVING TRICK IS A COOL WAY TO RUN LINES INSTEAD OF JUST LIKE RUNNING A MELODY ON ONE STRING
Hfh2d_K94HU_23 0 YOU CAN DO THAT OCTAVE TRICK AND MOVE IT UP IT SOUNDS THICKER
Hfh2d_K94HU_24 0 SO PRACTICE THAT TECHNIQUE IT'S A REALLY COOL ONE TO HAVE IN YOUR GUITAR PLAYING ARSENAL OKAY
Hfh2d_K94HU_25 0 IN THE NEXT SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IRON MAIDEN'S RUN TO THE HILLS
Hfh2d_K94HU_26 0 I'LL SEE YOU THERE
HiPCZZl51Ww_1 0 JOHNNY MILES IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT LAG PUTTING PUTTING FROM OUTSIDE 25 FEET
HiPCZZl51Ww_2 0 HERE I'VE GOT ABOUT A 35OR 40-FOOTER ON THE PRACTICE PUTTING GREEN AT TAMPA PALMS
HiPCZZl51Ww_3 0 AND MORE THAN ANYTHING WITH LAG PUTTING WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS GET A SENSE FOR THE OVERALL DISTANCE
HiPCZZl51Ww_4 0 THE SPEED OF THE PUTT IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN ITS DIRECTION
HiPCZZl51Ww_5 0 NOW OF COURSE IF THE PUTT THE SLOPE YOU'RE PUTTING ON IS PRETTY SEVERE YOU'D BETTER AIM IT OUT TO THE HIGH POINT
HiPCZZl51Ww_6 0 BUT MY POINT IS PEOPLE TEND TO FOCUS ON THE LINE AND FORGET ABOUT THE SPEED NOT REALIZING THAT THE ODDS OF THEM MAKING THIS PUTT AREN'T VERY GOOD
HiPCZZl51Ww_7 0 AND THE ODDS OF THEM THREE-PUTTING ARE PRETTY HIGH NOT BECAUSE THEY MISS THE SECOND ONE SO MUCH AS THEY DIDN'T LAG THE FIRST ONE CLOSE ENOUGH TO WHERE IT WAS YOU KNOW JUST A TAP IN
HiPCZZl51Ww_8 0 SO WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS I LIKE TO GET ABOUT HALF WAY AND I TRY TO GET A SENSE OF WHICH WAY THIS PUTT IS GOING TO BREAK
HiPCZZl51Ww_9 0 I SEE IT BREAKING FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
HiPCZZl51Ww_10 0 SO I'M TRYING TO PICK A HIGH POINT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE BALL AND THE HOLE
HiPCZZl51Ww_11 0 I'LL GO UP TO THAT HIGH POINT AND I'LL MAKE A COUPLE OF PRACTICE STROKES LOOKING AT THE HOLE
HiPCZZl51Ww_12 0 JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF HOW HARD THE BALL NEEDS TO BE MOVING HERE FOR IT TO GET TO THE HOLE
HiPCZZl51Ww_13 0 THEN I'LL WALK BACK
HiPCZZl51Ww_14 0 I'VE GOT MY HIGH POINT OUT THERE
HiPCZZl51Ww_15 0 I HAVE A SENSE OF HOW FAST IT WOULD BE FROM HALFWAY AND THEN I TRY TO PUTT IT TO THAT HALFWAY POINT WITH THE RIGHT SPEED
HiPCZZl51Ww_16 0 I MAKE ALL OF MY PRACTICE STROKES LOOKING AT THE TARGET
HiPCZZl51Ww_17 0 AGAIN AIM ISN'T NEARLY AS IMPORTANT AS SPEED
HiPCZZl51Ww_18 0 I LOOK AT THE HOLE
HiPCZZl51Ww_19 0 I LOOK AT THE HOLE
HiPCZZl51Ww_20 0 I SET UP TO IT
HiPCZZl51Ww_21 0 AIM IS OVER NOW
HiPCZZl51Ww_22 0 I'LL LOOK A COUPLE OF MORE TIMES JUST TO GET A FEEL FOR HOW FAR IT IS
HiPCZZl51Ww_23 0 WHEN I BRING MY EYES BACK TO THE BALL I GO AHEAD AND HIT IT
HiPCZZl51Ww_24 0 THAT'S WHEN THE OVERALL DISTANCE IS FRESHEST IN MY MIND AND I TEND TO ROLL AT THE RIGHT SPEED MORE TIMES THAN NOT
gwWmOiC6z4k_1 0 HI I'M JUDY CARRIER WITH JEWELS BY PARK LANE AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU HOW TO FIND OUT IF THE JEWELRY YOU'RE BUYING IS REAL
gwWmOiC6z4k_2 0 THE BIG THING IS ASK FOR DOCUMENTATION
gwWmOiC6z4k_3 0 IF IT'S A STONE SEE IF THEY HAVE PAPERS OF CERTIFICATION TELLING YOU THE KARAT
gwWmOiC6z4k_4 0 IF IT'S METAL LOOK FOR A STAMP
gwWmOiC6z4k_5 0 IF IT'S GOLD OR SOMETHING YOU SHOULD HAVE TEN KARAT TEN K FOURTEEN K SIXTEEN K EIGHTEEN K TWENTY K ON UP TO TWENTY FOUR K WHICH IS PURE GOLD
gwWmOiC6z4k_6 0 YOU KNOW AND THAT IS USUALLY STAMPED IF IT'S A BRACELET IT'LL BE INSIDE THE BRACELET USUALLY OR A RING IT'LL BE INSIDE A RING
gwWmOiC6z4k_7 0 ON A NECKLACE IT'S USUALLY UP BY THE CLASP
gwWmOiC6z4k_8 0 IF IT'S STERLING SILVER IT'S GOING TO BE STAMPED POINT NINE TWO FIVE STERLING SILVER
gwWmOiC6z4k_9 0 THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE STAMPED ON ANY ITEM THAT'S STERLING
gwWmOiC6z4k_10 0 THE OTHER THING THAT YOU WANT TO DO TO MAKE SURE IT'S REAL IS HAVE IT TESTED HAVE IT APPRAISED BY SOMEONE WHO IS AN EXPERT IN THE FIELD
gwWmOiC6z4k_11 0 ANY REPUTABLE JEWELER WILL HAVE A WAND LIKE INSTRUMENT THAT TEST DIAMONDS
gwWmOiC6z4k_12 0 FOR INSTANCE WHAT I WOULD DO WELL TO MAKE SURE IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT JEWELER PERSONALLY OR DON'T KNOW HIS REPUTATION IS PERHAPS TAKE A PAIR OF REALLY GOOD CUBIC ZIRCONIA EARRINGS AND HAVE HIM TEST THE EARRINGS
gwWmOiC6z4k_13 0 NOW IT SHOULD TURN FROM GREEN ALONG THE SIDE OF THE WAND SHOULD GO FROM GREEN TO RED IF IT'S REAL AND IT SHOULD BEEP
gwWmOiC6z4k_14 0 IF IT DOESN'T YOU KNOW IF DON'T GET A BEEP ON YOUR CUBIC ZIRCONIA BUT YOU DO GET A BEEP FOR INSTANCE ON YOUR RING THEN THAT'S PROBABLY REAL
gwWmOiC6z4k_15 0 THAT ONE WAY OF TELLING AND I WOULD MAKE SURE THEY TEST SOMETHING LIKE THIS FIRST
gwWmOiC6z4k_16 0 THAT WAY IT WON'T JUST BEEP WHEN THEY WANT IT TO
gwWmOiC6z4k_17 0 FOR INSTANCE IF YOU'RE DOING PEARLS ONE WAY TO TEST IT IS RUB IT AGAINST YOUR TEETH
gwWmOiC6z4k_18 0 IT DOESN'T WORK WITH MINE I HAVE FALSE TEETH
gwWmOiC6z4k_19 0 HOWEVER THEY SAY THAT IF IT'S SMOOTH IT'S PROBABLY FAKE
gwWmOiC6z4k_20 0 IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE ROUGHER WITH A REAL PEARL
gwWmOiC6z4k_21 0 ALSO CHECK THE BORE OF THE HOLE
gwWmOiC6z4k_22 0 A REAL PEARL HAS A VERY TINY BORE BECAUSE THEY TRY TO MAINTAIN THE VALUE OF THE PEARL
gwWmOiC6z4k_23 0 IT'LL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN HOW IT WEIGHS
gwWmOiC6z4k_24 0 REAL PEARLS ARE HEAVIER THAN FAKE
gwWmOiC6z4k_25 0 ANOTHER THING WILL BE THE WARMTH
gwWmOiC6z4k_26 0 NOW GLASS PEARLS HOWEVER TAKE A LITTLE LONGER TO WARM UP IN YOUR HAND THAN A REAL PEARL
gwWmOiC6z4k_27 0 SO IT'S STILL A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE THEM APPRAISED
gFZiilQMutQ_2 0 THIS IS JOHN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gFZiilQMutQ_3 0 IN THIS VIDEO CLIP I WILL SHOW YOU STEP TWO IN OUR PROCESS OF INSTALLING A BALL VALVE
gFZiilQMutQ_4 0 THE NEXT THING WE NEED TO DO IS LOCATE OUR MAIN WATER SHUT OFF AND WE NEED TO GO AHEAD AND TURN THAT KNOB
gFZiilQMutQ_5 0 REMEMBER RIGHTY TIGHTY LEFTY LOOSEY
gFZiilQMutQ_6 0 THIS IS GOING TO SHUT OFF THE WATER TO THE ENTIRE HOUSE AND HOPEFULLY WE WON'T HAVE TO BE DOING THIS ONCE WE INSTALL OUR BALL VALVE
gFZiilQMutQ_7 0 WE WILL JUST BE ABLE TO SHUT OFF THAT BALL VALVE
gFZiilQMutQ_8 0 THE NEXT THING THAT WE NEED TO DO IS RELIEVE ANY WATER PRESSURE THAT IS STILL IN THE LINES SO YOU CAN GO TO ANY FAUCET IN YOUR HOUSE AND TURN THAT ON AND WAIT TILL ALL THAT PRESSURE HAS BEEN RELIEVED FROM THE FAUCET
gFZiilQMutQ_9 0 WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN IS WHEN WE CUT THE PIPE WE DON'T WANT IT TO START SPRAYING WATER EVERYWHERE SO THAT IS WHY WE DO THIS
gVxZwMK5kgc_1 0 OKAY THE FIRST THING WE ARE GOING TO DO JUST LIKE THE LAST RECIPE IS CREAM THE BUTTER AND THE SUGAR
gVxZwMK5kgc_2 0 SO THIS IS ONE CUP OF BUTTER I'M JUST GOING TO TOSS THAT RIGHT IN THERE AND IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU BAKE WITH SOFTEN BUTTER
gVxZwMK5kgc_3 0 IF YOU HAVE THE TIME TAKE YOUR BLOCK OF BUTTER OUT LEAVE IT OUT FOR ABOUT A HOUR
gVxZwMK5kgc_4 0 IT SHOULD JUST BE ABLE TO MAKE A FINGER PRINT JUST LIKE THAT THAT IS ABOUT HOW SOFT IT SHOULD BE
gVxZwMK5kgc_5 0 YOU CAN ALSO PUT HARD BUTTER IN THE MICROWAVE FOR ABOUT 25 THIRTY SECONDS IF IT STARTS TO ALL MELT THOUGH THEN IT IS NO GOOD
gVxZwMK5kgc_6 0 SO YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE IT FINGER PRINT SOFT
gVxZwMK5kgc_7 0 OKAY AND WE ARE GOING TO PUT OUR SUGAR IN THIS IS 3/4 CUPS OF BROWN SUGAR IN WE GO AND I'M GOING TO MEASURE OUT 3/4 CUPS WHITE SUGAR THIS IS A FORTH OF A CUP
gVxZwMK5kgc_8 0 SO WE HAVE 1/4 2/4 3/4 AND WE ARE GOING TO CREAM IT TOGETHER
gVxZwMK5kgc_9 0 SO YOU WANT TO CREAM THIS ON MEDIUM SPEED FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES
gVxZwMK5kgc_10 0 SO WE ARE GOING TO LET THAT GO AND WHEN THAT IS FINISH I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MIX THE DRY INGREDIENTS
gr3yh_qEPiU_1 0 ALLAN DIWAN HI MY NAME IS ALLAN DIWAN
gr3yh_qEPiU_2 0 I'M THE CHEF AND OWNER OF KASHMIR RESTAURANT A KASHMIR-INDIAN RESTAURANT IN BUDAPEST
gr3yh_qEPiU_3 0 WE ARE HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gr3yh_qEPiU_4 0 WE'RE GOING TO PREPARE A RED SNAPPER IN A TANDOORI SAUCE
gr3yh_qEPiU_5 0 AND TO THIS WE ARE GOING TO ADD SOME YOGURT
gr3yh_qEPiU_6 0 AND OF COURSE WE ADDED SOME SALT ALREADY BUT I THINK IT NEEDS SLIGHTLY A LITTLE BIT MORE SALT IN IT
gr3yh_qEPiU_7 0 SO THIS IS ALMOST LIKE A NICE TANDOORI PASTE AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE A TANDOORI OVEN AT HOME YOU CAN EITHER PAN-FRY THIS FISH OR YOU CAN EITHER DIRECTLY PUT IT IN THE OVEN AND COOK IT DIRECTLY IN THE OVEN
gr3yh_qEPiU_8 0 BUT THIS IS A VERY NICE TANDOORI PASTE
gr3yh_qEPiU_9 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO AND BUY
gr3yh_qEPiU_10 0 IT USUALLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES
gr3yh_qEPiU_11 0 IF YOU GOT ALL THE INGREDIENTS IT TAKES A FEW MINUTES AND IT'S HEAVENLY WITH A VERY NICE FLAVOR
hJ_CfDvv_sw_1 0 THERE'S A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPEN VERY RARELY IN THE GAME OF BASEBALL
hJ_CfDvv_sw_2 0 AND WE'LL DEFINITELY TALK ABOUT THOSE RIGHT NOW
hJ_CfDvv_sw_3 0 THESE WE'LL CALL RARE PLAYS
hJ_CfDvv_sw_4 0 THEY CAN BE THINGS LIKE BATTER INTERFERENCE WHICH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER HOW TO SCORE IT BY WRITING INT AND WHAT THIS MEANS IS THE BATTER IS GOING TO BE THROWN OUT
hJ_CfDvv_sw_5 0 THIS IS A WAY TO GET OUT IN THE GAME OF BASEBALL MEANING THAT THE BATTER HAS MADE CONTACT WITH A FIELDER
hJ_CfDvv_sw_6 0 OKAY NOW THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN CATCHER'S INTERFERENCE IN WHICH THE BATTER WOULD ACTUALLY GET A HIT
hJ_CfDvv_sw_7 0 YOU STILL DENOTE THAT WITH AN INT BUT YOU DRAW YOUR LINE ADVANCING FROM HOME TO FIRST BASE
hJ_CfDvv_sw_8 0 THIS IS WHEN THE BATTER SWINGS THE BAT AND MAKES CONTACT WITH THE CATCHER'S GLOVE OR THE CATCHER GETS IN THE WAY SOMEHOW OF THE BATTER SO HE DOES GET ON BASE
hJ_CfDvv_sw_9 0 THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF AN ODDBALL PLAY
hJ_CfDvv_sw_10 0 A HIT BY PITCH HAPPENS A LITTLE BIT MORE OFTEN THAN IT SHOULD
hJ_CfDvv_sw_11 0 THAT MEANS THAT THE PITCHER'S ACTUALLY THROWN THE BALL AND HIT THE BATTER
hJ_CfDvv_sw_12 0 SOMETIMES THAT HAPPENS INTENTIONALLY
hJ_CfDvv_sw_13 0 BASEBALL LIKES TO POLICE ITSELF SO SOMETIMES WHEN A BATTER HAS SHOWN A PITCHER UP OR INSULTED THE PITCHER IN SOME WAY THEN THE PITCHER IN THE NEXT INNING WILL HIT HIM INTENTIONALLY
hJ_CfDvv_sw_14 0 SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS ACCIDENTALLY BUT YOU STILL DENOTE THAT WITH AN HBP A HIT BY PITCH
hJ_CfDvv_sw_15 0 THE OTHER THINGS THAT CAN COUNT HERE ARE WILD PITCHES WHICH IS OUR WP
hJ_CfDvv_sw_16 0 THIS IS WHEN THE PITCHER THROWS THE BALL WILDLY OUT OF THE CATCHER'S RANGE
hJ_CfDvv_sw_17 0 THIS IS NOT CONSIDERED AN ERROR
hJ_CfDvv_sw_18 0 IT'S DENOTED AND TALLIED SEPARATELY IN BASEBALL
hJ_CfDvv_sw_19 0 YOU MARK IT WITH A WP AND THE PITCHER WILL HAVE THAT KEPT IN HIS STATISTICAL CATEGORY
hJ_CfDvv_sw_20 0 NOW A PASSED BALL IS VERY SIMILAR TO A WILD PITCH
hJ_CfDvv_sw_21 0 THAT MEANS THAT THE CATCHER SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT THE CALL BUT DIDN'T
hJ_CfDvv_sw_22 0 THE BALL WAS THROWN WITHIN HIS ZONE OF CATCHING ABILITY BUT IT SOMEHOW GOT PAST HIM
hJ_CfDvv_sw_23 0 NOW THAT IS COUNTED AS AN ERROR
hJ_CfDvv_sw_24 0 THAT'S AN E2
hJ_CfDvv_sw_25 0 AND THOSE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE RARE PLAYS IN BASEBALL
hJ_CfDvv_sw_26 0 YOU WON'T SEE THEM OFTEN BUT IT'S GOOD TO KNOW HOW TO MARK THEM IF YOU SEEM THEM
HBZZ4JMBweA_2 0 I'M SARAH MCLELLAN AND WE ARE IN NEW YORK CITY
HBZZ4JMBweA_3 0 TODAY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO APPLY MAKEUP FOR STAGE

HBZZ4JMBweA_7 0 I HAVE A REALLY NICE SHARP JET-BLACK PENCIL EYELINER THAT I'M GOING TO USE TO GO UNDERNEATH MY EYES TO START WITH
HBZZ4JMBweA_8 0 WE'RE GOING TO START UNDERNEATH AND JUST KIND OF BRING THE EYELINER UNDER AND DO IT ON THE OTHER EYE TOO
HBZZ4JMBweA_9 0 DON'T GO TOO FAR UNDER LIKE I JUST DID
HBZZ4JMBweA_10 0 BRING IT AROUND
HBZZ4JMBweA_11 0 ON THIS ONE I'VE KIND OF GIVEN IT A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH SO YOU WANT TO USE YOUR FINGER TO KIND OF FADE THAT
HBZZ4JMBweA_12 0 WE'RE NOW READY TO DO THE EYELINER ON TOP OF THE LASHES
HBZZ4JMBweA_13 0 FOR THAT I LIKE TO USE A NICE LIQUID EYELINER JUST BECAUSE I THINK IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT BETTER ONCE YOU'VE GOT THAT DONE
HBZZ4JMBweA_14 0 JUST KIND OF PULL YOUR EYE AGAIN BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE HOW THE EYELASH LOOKS A BIT FUNNY ON TOP
HBZZ4JMBweA_15 0 YOU'RE GOING TO USE THAT NICE LIQUID EYELINER TO DRAW A STRAIGHT LINE ALL THE WAY TO THE END
HBZZ4JMBweA_16 0 AS YOU CAN SEE I'VE LINED UNDERNEATH MY EYES AND I'VE ALSO DONE SOME LIQUID EYELINER ON TOP
HBZZ4JMBweA_17 0 THIS JUST MAKES EVERYTHING KIND OF POP FOR YOUR EYES

gkJrcjqrM1k_9 0 YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HEARTH IS NICE AND CLEAN AND THAT THERE IS NO FLAMMABLE MATERIALS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE FIREPLACE
gkJrcjqrM1k_10 0 THIS PARTICULAR HOUSE THAT I AM IN IS TILE RIGHT HERE SO IT IS A PRETTY SAFE SETUP
gkJrcjqrM1k_11 0 YOU JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT ANYTHING YOU CAN CATCH ON FIRE IS A GOOD DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE FIREPLACE

GNJXOFxMiMw_5 0 REMOVE THE TOWEL AND WASH THE FACE USING CLEANSER FORMULATED FOR YOUR SKIN TYPE
GNJXOFxMiMw_6 0 FILL A POT WITH WATER AND ADD HERBS OR ESSENTIAL OILS

GkoL6Zicmb0_1 0 HI MY NAME IS DANNY AND I AM FROM TAMPA FLORIDA ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GkoL6Zicmb0_2 0 I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO USE AND MAINTAIN A BAND SAW
GkoL6Zicmb0_3 0 OK NOW I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT POWERING THE BAND SAW
GkoL6Zicmb0_4 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE WHAT YOU ARE PLUGGING IT UP TO
GkoL6Zicmb0_5 0 THIS IS A 110 PLUG
GkoL6Zicmb0_6 0 SOME BAND SAWS COME IN 220 SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR PLUGGING IT IN THE RIGHT OUTLET
GkoL6Zicmb0_7 0 I HAVE THIS POWER STRIP RIGHT HERE
GkoL6Zicmb0_8 0 SO I WILL PLUG THIS IN
GkoL6Zicmb0_9 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS THIS IS OFF BEFORE YOU PLUG IT IN
GkoL6Zicmb0_10 0 ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR SAFETY GLASSES ON
GkoL6Zicmb0_11 0 BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY START CUTTING ANYTHING YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT TURNS ON AND EVERYTHING SOUNDS GOOD
GkoL6Zicmb0_12 0 IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S WORKING PROPERLY
GkoL6Zicmb0_13 0 SO YOU SET IT UP WHERE YOU NEED TO SET IT UP
GkoL6Zicmb0_14 0 MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT BLADE ON AND START CUTTING
gWDGiVZGd1M_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS GRADY JOHNSON AND I'M A PROFESSIONAL PAINTER
gWDGiVZGd1M_2 0 TODAY I'M REPRESENTING EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
gWDGiVZGd1M_3 0 WELL YOU CAN SEE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF LIGHT
gWDGiVZGd1M_4 0 I'VE HAD TO LOSE MY SUNGLASSES
gWDGiVZGd1M_5 0 BUT I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND CUT IN THIS WALL NOW
gWDGiVZGd1M_6 0 NOW THE EAVES ARE LOOKING REALLY GOOD
gWDGiVZGd1M_7 0 AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO CUT IN A STRAIGHT LINE RIGHT ALONG THE EDGE HERE
gWDGiVZGd1M_8 0 NOW THIS POINT WILL COME IN HANDY WHEN YOU GET INTO THOSE TIGHT CORNERS
gWDGiVZGd1M_9 0 AND REMEMBER THE LINE YOU CUT HERE IS THE PERMANENT ONE
gWDGiVZGd1M_10 0 SO BE CAREFUL NOT TO GET ANY UP ON THE WHITE
gWDGiVZGd1M_11 0 SO GO AHEAD AND GET YOURSELF A FULL LOAD OF PAINT
gWDGiVZGd1M_12 0 REMEMBER JUST PAT THAT INTO THE SIDES AND CUT YOUR LINE
gWDGiVZGd1M_13 0 NOW WHEN YOU THROW THE LINE OUT THROW IT A LITTLE BIT BELOW THE ACTUAL PLACE YOU WANT THE LINE TO GO FIRST
gWDGiVZGd1M_14 0 AND THEN WORK THAT PAINT UP IN THERE
gWDGiVZGd1M_15 0 NOW THESE CORNERS YOU WANT TO JUST LAY IT UP IN THERE AND BUILD THAT LITTLE CORNER FOR YOURSELF
gWDGiVZGd1M_16 0 ONCE YOU'VE GOT THAT CORNER JUST DRAW THAT ON DOWN
gWDGiVZGd1M_17 0 NOW WHEN YOU GO SIDEWAYS LIKE THIS YOU'LL GET MORE PAINT ON YOUR BRUSH
gWDGiVZGd1M_18 0 AND JUST PULL OUT THAT LINE AS STRAIGHT AS YOU CAN
gWDGiVZGd1M_19 0 NOW YOU CAN TAPE THIS TOO
gWDGiVZGd1M_20 0 THE PROBLEM WITH TAPE THOUGH IS YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE IT ALL DOWN WHEN YOU'RE DONE
gWDGiVZGd1M_21 0 ONCE YOU REALLY LEARN HOW TO CUT A LINE YOU'LL SAVE A LOT OF TIME IF YOU DON'T NEED TO USE THE TAPE
gWDGiVZGd1M_22 0 TAPE DOES MAKE IT EASIER THOUGH
gWDGiVZGd1M_23 0 BUT REMEMBER THE TAPE'S NOT THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING
gWDGiVZGd1M_24 0 IF YOU DO PAINT ON TAPE BE SURE YOU LAP UP OVER IT AND NOT UNDERNEATH IT OR IT'LL ROLL UP UNDERNEATH THE TAPE
gWDGiVZGd1M_25 0 GO AHEAD AND PULL THAT LINE ON OUT
gWDGiVZGd1M_26 0 YOU WANT TO GET THAT NICE AND STRAIGHT
gWDGiVZGd1M_28 0 NOW ONCE YOU'VE GOT IT STRAIGHT ONCE YOU'VE GOT A STRAIGHT LINE YOU JUST FILL IN THE REST OF IT
gWDGiVZGd1M_29 0 AND THEN LEAVE JUST ENOUGH ROOM TO GET YOUR ROLLER UP IN THERE
gWDGiVZGd1M_30 0 NOW YOU DON'T WANT TO LEAVE IT TOO NARROW OR YOUR ROLLER'S GOING TO BOUNCE UP ON TOP HERE
gWDGiVZGd1M_31 0 SO CUT IT ON DOWN HERE A GOOD WAYS SO THAT WHEN YOU ROLL UP TO IT YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF ROOM
gWDGiVZGd1M_32 0 AND THEN I'M GOING TO FILL IN THAT BOTTOM PART UNDERNEATH IT
gWDGiVZGd1M_33 0 NOW YOU'LL FIND THIS STUCCO SOMETIMES TAKES A LITTLE MORE
gWDGiVZGd1M_34 0 JUST FILL IT ON IN THERE
gWDGiVZGd1M_35 0 AND IF YOU CAN GET A STUBBORN HOLE TO FILL UP JUST PUMP THAT BRUSH A LITTLE BIT IN AND OUT AND THAT'LL MOVE THAT PAINT UP INTO INTO THE BRUSH
gWDGiVZGd1M_37 0 NOW YOU SEE THAT I CUT A PRETTY GOOD FREE LINE AND YOU WILL TOO ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT
gWDGiVZGd1M_38 0 BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE TAPE
gWDGiVZGd1M_39 0 A LOT OF PEOPLE DO
gWDGiVZGd1M_40 0 NOW THE TRICK TO USING TAPE IS YOU NEED TO BRUSH OFF THE TAPE AND NOT LET THE BRUSH ROLL UNDERNEATH IT
gWDGiVZGd1M_41 0 IF THAT BRUSH ROLLS UNDERNEATH IT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A MESS AND IT'S NOT GOING TO LOOK LIKE A STRAIGHT LINE
gWDGiVZGd1M_42 0 IF YOU'RE ALWAYS BRUSHING OFF THE TOP OF THAT TAPE THEN YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM
gWDGiVZGd1M_43 0 TAPE'S A GOOD WAY TO START BUT IT'S HARD TO FILL IN THE LITTLE TEENY HOLES IN THE STUCCO WHICH YOU'LL LEARN IF YOU LEARN HOW TO USE THE BRUSH
gWDGiVZGd1M_44 0 ALSO IF YOU KNOW HOW TO CUT IN A GOOD SHARP LINE AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAPE YOU'RE GOING TO SAVE YOURSELF A LOT OF TIME

gWDGiVZGd1M_46 0 I'M GOING TO FILL IN THE REST HERE
gWDGiVZGd1M_47 0 CUT IN THESE BOTTOMS
gWDGiVZGd1M_49 0 ANOTHER LITTLE TRICK IS IS WHEN YOU FEEL YOUR BRUSH GETTING LOW JUST PUMP IT UP AND DOWN A LITTLE BIT
gWDGiVZGd1M_50 0 AND YOU'LL PUT A LITTLE MORE PAINT TOWARDS THE END OF YOUR BRISTLES
gWDGiVZGd1M_51 0 AND THAT'LL SOMETIMES FILL IN A NASTY HOLE
gWDGiVZGd1M_52 0 THE KEY REALLY IS JUST TO KEEP A FIRM GRIP ON THE BRUSH
gWDGiVZGd1M_53 0 THERE'S A SAYING IN PAINT IF YOU DROP YOUR BRUSH YOU BUY THE BEER
gWDGiVZGd1M_54 0 BECAUSE A LOT OF PAINTERS BELIEVE IT OR NOT LIKE BEER
gWDGiVZGd1M_56 0 NOW WE CHECK OUR CORNERS AFTER WE'VE GOT THAT DONE
gWDGiVZGd1M_57 0 IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD TO ME
gWDGiVZGd1M_58 0 NOW I'M READY TO MOVE ONTO THE NEXT SECTION

HgygFoU1_4Y_4 0 RULE #2 IS STAY OUT OF THE HOLE
HgygFoU1_4Y_5 0 DOING TIME ENDING OF ITSELF IS HARD TIME BUT THE HARDEST TIME THAT YOU CAN POSSIBLY DO WHEN YOU ARE INCARCERATED WOULD BE SOLITARY CONFINEMENT
HgygFoU1_4Y_6 0 IN THE PRISON SYSTEM THEY HAVE VARIOUS RANKINGS OR WHAT HAVE YOU NOT FOR DIFFERENT VIOLATIONS OF THE RULES AND REGULATIONS AND SOMETIMES THE ACTUAL LAWS OF THE CITY OR STATE THAT YOU'RE INCARCERATED IN AND BEING IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT GUARANTEES THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO YOUR FAMILY OUTSIDE OF THE PRISON
HgygFoU1_4Y_7 0 YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO THE OTHER INMATES IN THE PRISON

HgygFoU1_4Y_9 0 IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT AND I KNOW THAT DURING THAT TIME BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE AFFILIATIONS BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE CONNECTIONS IT BRINGS A LOT OF LONELINESS AND CONTENT
HgygFoU1_4Y_10 0 STAYING OUT OF THE WHOLE IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING TO DO

GVzIvgu48HY_2 0 THIS IS ROBERT STEWART WITH HILL13.COM
GVzIvgu48HY_3 0 NOW WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A MASK YOU CAN INVEST ANYWHERE FROM ABOUT FIFTEEN TO 110 DOLLARS ON A MASK DEPENDING ON THE BRAND AND THE NUMBER OF FEATURES YOU WANT IN IT WHETHER YOU WANT ANTI-GLARE OR ANTI-FOG FINISHES FANS AND WHAT NOT
GVzIvgu48HY_4 0 SO YOU CAN OVERBUILD A MASK AND INVEST QUITE A BIT OF MONEY IN ONE JUST TO MAKE IT TRICK
GVzIvgu48HY_5 0 BUT THE MASK WHETHER IT'S A STANDARDIZED MASK OR A VERY EXPENSIVE MASK IS A STRICT COMPLIANCE ISSUE
GVzIvgu48HY_6 0 AND IT'S REALLY THE GOLDEN RULE IN PAINTBALL
GVzIvgu48HY_7 0 IF YOU GO TO A REPUTABLE FIELD YOU'RE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT
GVzIvgu48HY_8 0 IF YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS GO OUT AND YOU'RE PLAYING IN A FIELD SOMEWHERE MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE ALL WEARING THE PROPER HEADGEAR
GVzIvgu48HY_9 0 FAILURE TO DO SO COULD CAUSE YOU A LIFETIME OF REGRET IF SOMEONE WERE TO BE INJURED
GVzIvgu48HY_10 0 SO DON'T LET AN ASTM STICKER ON A PAIR OF SNOWMOBILE GLASSES FOOL YOU
GVzIvgu48HY_11 0 IF THEY'RE NOT MADE FOR PAINTBALL YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO USE THEM
GVzIvgu48HY_12 0 SO REMEMBER ALWAYS FIRST AND FOREMOST WEAR A PROPER MASK
grUc4z8LWc8_1 0 MY NAME IS DIANA GOTERIZ AND I AM A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER IN SAN JOSE
grUc4z8LWc8_2 0 SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT I HAVE USED ARE THE TRADITIONAL TEXT BOOKS OF COURSE AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE STANDARDS TO HELP GUIDE THE CURRICULUMS ESPECIALLY IF A CURRICULUM IS NOT SET WHICH IS THE CASE IN A LOT OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT I SEE
grUc4z8LWc8_3 0 ALSO A GREAT RESOURCE ARE YOU COWORKERS
grUc4z8LWc8_4 0 A LOT OF TIMES ESPECIALLY CERTAIN LESSONS MAYBE DURING A NOVEL UNIT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING FOR YOUR STUDENTS AND THE TRADITIONAL LESSON PLAN WON'T WORK SO YOU CAN ASK YOUR COWORKERS TO SEE LAST PAST LESSONS THAT THEY'VE DONE AND ALSO MIX AND MATCH YOUR OWN
grUc4z8LWc8_5 0 ANOTHER GREAT RESOURCE IF YOU NEED JUST BASIC SUPPLIES FOR YOUR CLASSROOM A LOT OF TIMES PUBLIC SCHOOLS DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS TO PROVIDE THE POSTERS AND THE PENCILS AND THE OVERHEAD MARKERS THAT YOU NEED
grUc4z8LWc8_6 0 CRAIG'S LIST HAS A PLACE ON THERE CALLED THE TEACHER'S WISH LIST AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY PLACE YOUR SCHOOL ON THERE AND THE MATERIALS THAT YOU NEED AND GET FREE SUPPLIES THAT WAY
grUc4z8LWc8_7 0 ALSO AGAIN YOUR MENTORS COME INTO PLAY COLLEGE PROFESSORS CAN GIVE YOU ADVICE AND ALSO FOR FIRST YEAR TEACHERS IT IS SUPER IMPORTANT TO BRING IN ADVISERS TO OBSERVE YOU DURING THE YEAR AND GET FEEDBACK
grUc4z8LWc8_8 0 MY NAME IS DIANA GOTERIZ AND I AM A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER IN SAN JOSE

h28uU__Xn1o_1 0 HELLO THIS IS JB AND I'M WITH AUSTIN HOMEBREW SUPPLY HERE IN BEAUTIFUL AUSTIN TEXAS AND TODAY WE ARE DISCUSSING WINE MAKING EQUIPMENT
h28uU__Xn1o_2 0 ONE OF THE THINGS YOU NEED TO DO WHEN YOU'RE MAKING HOMEMADE WINE IS TO TRANSFER OR TO RACK THE WINE FROM ONE VESSEL TO ANOTHER
h28uU__Xn1o_3 0 SO IN TERMS OF WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT YOU NEED TO EITHER USE A RACKING CANE OR AN AUTO SIPHON
h28uU__Xn1o_4 0 THESE GUYS ARE EXAMPLES OF RACKING CANES AND I JUST WANTED TO DISCUSS THE DIFFERENCES IN THE SIZE OF THE DIAMETER
h28uU__Xn1o_5 0 THE SMALLER ONE IS THREE-EIGHTHS INCH DIAMETER THE BIGGER ONE IS HALF-INCH
h28uU__Xn1o_6 0 NOW DEPENDING ON WHICH ONE YOU CHOOSE IN TERMS OF YOUR RACKING CANES YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO CHOOSE THE APPROPRIATE SIZE SIPHON HOSE
h28uU__Xn1o_7 0 SO HALF INCH IS A LARGER INTERNAL DIAMETER ON SIPHON HOSE AND THIS IS THREE-EIGHTHS INCH INTERNAL DIAMETER
h28uU__Xn1o_8 0 THE ONLY OTHER REAL OPTION HERE IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE THICK-WALLED OR THE THIN-WALLED VERSION OF THIS HOSE THERE'S ALSO A SILICONE HOSE AVAILABLE WHICH REALLY IS ONLY FOR HIGH HEAT APPLICATIONS SO NOT REALLY APPLICABLE IN WINE MAKING
h28uU__Xn1o_9 0 THIS STUFF HERE IS VINYL HOSE IT'S FEW GAVE VINYL
h28uU__Xn1o_10 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE CHOOSING A RACKING CANE MAKE SURE YOU CHOOSE THE APPROPRIATE HOSE
h28uU__Xn1o_11 0 EITHER THREE EIGHTHS OR HALF INCH INTERNAL DIAMETER

-h50JLzr254_1 0 AN EXCEPTIONALLY PAINFUL AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY TRAUMATIZING VITAL POINT DEFENSE WE CAN USE FOR WOMEN'S SELF DEFENSE DEALS WITH THE UNDERARMS DEALING WITH THE UNDERARMS
-h50JLzr254_2 0 IF TRACEY GRABS ME IN A FRONT CHOKE RIGHT HERE SHE EXPOSES HERSELF
-h50JLzr254_3 0 EVEN FROM A WRIST GRAB I CAN GET ACCESS TO THAT
-h50JLzr254_4 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS AS SHE'S ATTACKING ME I'M GOING TO CLAW
-h50JLzr254_5 0 I'M GOING TO OPEN UP MY CLAWS JUST AS I DID ON THE FACE AND THE EAR AND I COME AND I GRAB TISSUE UNDERNEATH THE FOREARMS
-h50JLzr254_6 0 NOW THIS IS MUCH EASIER WITH MEN BECAUSE I CAN GRAB A GREAT DEAL OF HAIR AS WELL AS TISSUE
-h50JLzr254_7 0 I'M GOING TO MAKE A CLOSING CLAW AND I REACH UP IN THE ARMPITS AND SQUEEZE JUST LIKE THIS
-h50JLzr254_8 0 GRAB AS MUCH TISSUE AS YOU CAN
-h50JLzr254_9 0 AND NOW I DRAW BACK TO MY CENTER
-h50JLzr254_10 0 IF IT DOESN'T COME LOOSE I PUSH IT FORWARD
-h50JLzr254_11 0 I PULL IT BACK
-h50JLzr254_12 0 MOVE ONE UP ONE DOWN
-h50JLzr254_13 0 IT'S AS IF YOU'RE TRYING TO WRESTLE AND TEAR THE TISSUE OFF FROM UNDERNEATH THE ARMS
-h50JLzr254_14 0 THE ULTIMATE SITUATION IS THEY'RE IN A VERY LIGHT T-SHIRT AND ATTACKING YOU
-h50JLzr254_15 0 YOU REACH UP AND GRAB A HANDFUL OF TISSUE AND ARMPIT HAIR AND BEGIN TO TEAR THAT AND YOU WILL GET A VERY QUICK RESPONSE
-h50JLzr254_16 0 NOW UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE THIS IS A VERY PAINFUL TECHNIQUE YOU WILL STILL NEED TO GET FREE OF THEM
-h50JLzr254_17 0 I'M PULLING THEM TO ME AND PUSHING THEM BACK
-h50JLzr254_18 0 I WANT TO GET THEM TO THE POINT WHERE THEY LET GO AND THEN ESCAPE
-h50JLzr254_19 0 SO A GOOD STRONG AND AGGRESSIVE ARMPIT ATTACK IS A VERY GOOD VITAL POINT TO KNOW FOR WOMEN IN SELF-DEFENSE

-guGqYfmecM_5 0 THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE JUST DID
-guGqYfmecM_6 0 PUT IT UP A LITTLE BIT HIGHER
-guGqYfmecM_7 0 AND NOW WE CAN SEE THAT IF WE JUMP INTO THIS ORANGE PORTAL IT'LL GIVE US ENOUGH MOMENTUM TO BE LAUNCHED OUT OF THE BLUE ONE WHICH IS NOW MUCH HIGHER AND WILL ALLOW US TO GET ACROSS THIS BIGGER CHASM
-guGqYfmecM_8 0 HERE WE GO INTO THE ORANGE AND IT LAUNCHED US ACROSS
-guGqYfmecM_10 0 ACTUALLY NOT QUITE WE DIDN'T QUITE MAKE IT BUT THIS PLACE GOT US HIGHER
-guGqYfmecM_11 0 SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS PUT THE BLUE PORTAL UP HERE NOW
-guGqYfmecM_12 0 SEE WHEN WE DID THAT IT GOT US UP TO STAGE TWO OF THIS CHALLENGE BUT NOT ALL THE WAY UP
-guGqYfmecM_13 0 WHEN WE DID THAT THE PLATFORM THAT WE HAD HAD OUR BLUE PORTAL ON MOVED
-guGqYfmecM_14 0 IT GOT CLOSER SO THAT IT CAN HELP US GET UP OVER THIS THIRD STAGE OF THE TEST CHAMBER
-guGqYfmecM_15 0 NOW WE'RE UP HIGHER WHICH MEANS THAT WE'LL GET EVEN MORE MOMENTUM WHEN WE JUMP INTO THIS PORTAL AND THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO LAUNCH US THE REST OF THE WAY ACROSS

Gv2hBDeht4I_12 0 GETS REALLY GELLY SO I'LL GO THROUGH THAT STEP AND THE PROCESS OF ALL OF THAT RIGHT IN THE NEXT STEPS
Gv2hBDeht4I_13 0 YOU NEED TO HAVE THREE DIFFERENT BRUSHES WATER TO RINSE YOUR BRUSHES OUT OR ALCOHOL AND POSSIBLY ANOTHER TOWEL TO KEEP ALL THE PAINT ON
Gv2hBDeht4I_14 0 THIS IS A BIG BEGINNING STEP FOR THE END
Gv2hBDeht4I_15 0 SO WE'LL GET EVERYTHING ALL READY I'LL GO THROUGH IT ALL IN THE NEXT STEP AND WE'LL START

Gvg_80PlAAs_1 0 IN THIS SECTION WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS SOME METHODS YOU CAN USE IN DEALING WITH TOUGH CUSTOMERS
Gvg_80PlAAs_2 0 I'M PAMELA UNRUH ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
Gvg_80PlAAs_3 0 LET START BY TALKING ABOUT EMPATHIZING WITH YOUR CUSTOMER
Gvg_80PlAAs_4 0 NOW A LOT OF CUSTOMER SERVICE PROVIDERS CAN SAY THAT THEY SHOW SYMPATHY TO THEIR CUSTOMERS THE CUSTOMER COMES IN AND THEY ARE HAVING A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT ISSUE
Gvg_80PlAAs_5 0 BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EMPATHY AND SYMPATHY
Gvg_80PlAAs_6 0 I THINK THE BEST WAY OF EVER HAVING THIS EXPLAIN TO ME WAS FROM A SUPERVISOR WHO ONCE SAID THINK ABOUT TAKING A WALK THROUGH THE JUNGLE
Gvg_80PlAAs_7 0 YOU COME ACROSS SOMEBODY WHO IS SINKING IN QUICK SAND YOU CAN FEEL BAD FOR THE PERSON AND RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS A VERY TOUGH SITUATION THAT'S EMPATHY
Gvg_80PlAAs_8 0 BUT IF YOU JUMP INTO THE MUD PUDDLE WITH THE CUSTOMER THEN THAT'S SYMPATHY
Gvg_80PlAAs_9 0 BY DOING THAT YOU'RE REALLY NOT DOING ANYBODY ANY FAVORS EMPATHIZE AND RECOGNIZE THE CUSTOMERS SITUATION AS THEY SEE IT
Gvg_80PlAAs_10 0 NOW WHAT EVER IS AN EMERGENCY TO A CUSTOMER YOU MAY RECOGNIZE RIGHT AWAY SOMETHING THAT IS VERY EASY TO DEAL WITH
Gvg_80PlAAs_11 0 DON'T DOWN PLAY THE FACT TO THE CUSTOMER MAY BE UPSET ABOUT IT LET THE CUSTOMER NOW THAT YOU DO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE FEELING AND WHAT THEY ARE THINKING
Gvg_80PlAAs_12 0 BE SURE THAT YOU LET THE CUSTOMER KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP
g-KjWJgFtKA_1 0 HI I'M JESSICA SMITH WITH BLANDS NURSERY IN WEST JORDAN UTAH AND TODAY WE ARE TALKING ALL ABOUT TREES AND SHRUBS
g-KjWJgFtKA_2 0 RIGHT NOW WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS HOW TO FERTILIZE EVERGREEN TREES
g-KjWJgFtKA_3 0 MOST EVERGREENS DO NOT NEED FERTILIZER AND ACTUALLY DO NOT LIKE FERTILIZER
g-KjWJgFtKA_4 0 MOST PEOPLE ACTUALLY KILL THEIR EVERGREEN TREES WITH TOO MUCH FERTILIZER
g-KjWJgFtKA_5 0 IF EVERGREENS ARE GIVEN PLENTY OF SUN AND PLENTY OF DEEP APPLICATIONS OF WATER AND ARE PLANTED PROPERLY TO BEGIN WITH YOU SHOULDN'T REALLY NEED ANY
g-KjWJgFtKA_6 0 ON OCCASION IT MAY LOSE THAT LUSTERY GREEN COLOR
g-KjWJgFtKA_7 0 IT MAY NEED JUST A LITTLE BIT OF NITROGEN AND WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS JUST SPRINKLE MAYBE A TABLESPOON OR TWO DOWN AROUND THE SOIL LATE LATE IN THE WINTER OR EARLY EARLY SPRING AND LET MOTHER NATURE WATER IT IN
g-KjWJgFtKA_8 0 NEVER EVER ADD A COMMERCIAL FERTILIZER WHEN PLANTING AROUND THE ROOT SYSTEM
g-KjWJgFtKA_9 0 THAT WILL SURELY KILL YOUR TREE
g-KjWJgFtKA_10 0 JUST ORGANIC MATTER AND MICRO IZEE DOWN IN THE SOIL
g-KjWJgFtKA_11 0 BOTH OF THOSE TWO WILL WORK TOGETHER AND ACTUALLY IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF YOUR TREE
GMRtRwDO36Q_1 0 SO NOW WE'RE IN MY BEDROOM AND THE FIRST THING THAT WE WANT TO LOOK FOR LIKE WE HAVE IN EVERY ROOM IS THINGS ARE THINGS THAT I DON'T NEED THAT I DON'T WANT THAT ARE BROKEN THAT I WANT TO GIVE AWAY
GMRtRwDO36Q_2 0 AND SOME KIND OF KEY PLACES TO LOOK IN THE BEDROOM FOR THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ARE THE BED SIDE BED SIDE TABLE WHERE RANDOM THINGS TEND TO COLLECT
GMRtRwDO36Q_3 0 AND THE DESK IF YOU HAVE A DESK IN YOUR ROOM
GMRtRwDO36Q_4 0 THIS KIND OF SERVES AS MY DESK
GMRtRwDO36Q_5 0 ANY CLOSETS OR CABINETS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE IN YOUR ROOM
GMRtRwDO36Q_6 0 SHELVES THESE KINDS OF PLACES
GMRtRwDO36Q_7 0 YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO LOOK FOR THINGS THAT YOU DON'T NEED YOU DON'T WANT ANY MORE ARE BROKEN
GMRtRwDO36Q_8 0 SO FOR INSTANCE I MIGHT I'VE ACTUALLY ALREADY DONE THIS
GMRtRwDO36Q_9 0 BUT I'VE GONE THROUGH MY JOURNALS GONE THROUGH THESE BLANK BOOKS AND SOME OF THEM THAT I'D JUST KEPT NOTES IN THAT I DIDN'T NEED ANY MORE
GMRtRwDO36Q_10 0 I'VE THROWN THOSE AWAY AND I DONATED A COUPLE OF BLANK BOOKS THAT I HADN'T WRITTEN IN AT ALL
GMRtRwDO36Q_11 0 UNDERNEATH ON MY BEDSIDE TABLE I GAVE AWAY SOME OF THE BOOKS THAT HAD ACCUMULATED THERE AND THERE WERE A COUPLE OF KNICK KNACKS THAT I GOT RID OF AND DONATED
GMRtRwDO36Q_12 0 SO THAT'S ALL KIND OF IN THE SERVICE OF JUST CLEANING THINGS UP SO THAT I WHEN GETTING RID OF THINGS SO THAT I DON'T SO I HAVE LESS TO MOVE

GW2MSpjFh1s_5 0 MAYBE YOU NEED TO MOVE IT TO YOUR HOTEL ROOM
GW2MSpjFh1s_6 0 SO THE THINK IS TO BE ABLE TO DO YOUR PRACTICE FOR YOURSELF WITHOUT THE HELP OF YOGAS EVEN THOUGH IT'S SO MUCH NICER TO GO TO A STUDIO AND FEEL THE ENERGY OF OTHERS
GW2MSpjFh1s_7 0 YOU CAN STILL GET THAT ENERGY
GW2MSpjFh1s_8 0 THAT MEDITATION IS GREAT TO DO BY YOURSELF
GW2MSpjFh1s_9 0 AND STILL THE STRETCHING AND ALL THE BENEFITS THAT COME FROM YOGA IF YOU TAKE YOUR PRACTICE HOME
GW2MSpjFh1s_10 0 YOU NEED TO GET YOURSELF A YOGA MAT
GW2MSpjFh1s_11 0 AND YOU WANT TO TRY TO FIND A QUIET PLACE
GW2MSpjFh1s_12 0 SO THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TURN OFF YOUR CELL PHONE TURN OFF YOUR TELEVISION TURN OFF ANYTHING THAT CAN DISTRACT YOU
GW2MSpjFh1s_13 0 AND JUST ALLOW THIS TIME TO BE FOR YOU
GW2MSpjFh1s_14 0 SOME INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS MAYBE SOME COMPUTER PROGRAMS SOMETHING TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO
GW2MSpjFh1s_15 0 WE NORMALLY BEGIN WITH STRETCHING MOVE ON TO SOME MORE ENERGETIC STANDING POSES AND THEN END WITH STRETCHING AND MEDITATION
GW2MSpjFh1s_16 0 SO WHEREVER YOU ARE
GW2MSpjFh1s_17 0 SUN SALUTATION IS A GREAT THING
GW2MSpjFh1s_18 0 IF YOU JUST DO NOTHING ELSE BUT DO A SUN SALUTATION THAT WILL STRETCH YOUR ENTIRE BODY
GW2MSpjFh1s_19 0 WHATEVER ELSE YOU DO IF YOU CAN'T GET INTO A STUDIO IF YOU TRAVEL A LOT LEARN TO TAKE YOUR PRACTICE HOME
GW2MSpjFh1s_20 0 FIND A COMFORTABLE PLACE GET A NICE MAT AND DO YOUR THING EVERY DAY AT HOME

H8JRCO4B5XM_2 0 IN THIS CLIP WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT A STRUT MOUNT IS AND WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED
H8JRCO4B5XM_3 0 STRUTS HAVE BEEN TAKING THE PLACE OF SHOCK ABSORBERS PRETTY PROGRESSIVELY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OR SO
H8JRCO4B5XM_4 0 MOST VEHICLES HAVE GONE TO FULL FOUR WHEEL INDEPENDENT SUSPENSION
H8JRCO4B5XM_5 0 IT IS LIGHT WEIGHT CONSTRUCTION AND WHAT THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE IS AN ASSEMBLY OF THE SHOCK ABSORBER AND THE SPRING IN ONE PIECE THAT IS LABELED A STRUT
H8JRCO4B5XM_6 0 IN THE REAR ON MOST VEHICLES THE STRUT MOUNT IS A SOLID COMPONENT SUCH AS THIS
H8JRCO4B5XM_7 0 THE COMPONENT WILL NOT TURN INDEPENDENTLY BEING THAT THIS IS THE UPPER MOUNTING POINT FOR THE SUSPENSION
H8JRCO4B5XM_8 0 IN THE FRONT HOWEVER THIS WILL HAVE TO TURN THE TOP PORTION IS GOING TO STAY STATIONARY AND THE LOWER PORTION IS GOING TO PIVOT THAT ALLOWS YOU TO TURN WHEN YOU NEED TO STEER THE VEHICLE
H8JRCO4B5XM_9 0 THEY ARE LOCATED UP ON THE TOP RIGHT ABOVE THE WHEEL
H8JRCO4B5XM_10 0 IT IS GOING TO BE IN A AREA CALLED THE SUSPENSION TOWER
H8JRCO4B5XM_11 0 IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT THE CENTER OF YOUR VEHICLE'S TIRE AND GO UP APPROXIMATELY A FOOT AND A HALF YOU ARE GOING TO RUN INTO WHERE THE STRUT MOUNT IS LOCATED

GbLshtiLaIs_3 0 WHERE WHAT WE'RE WANTING TO DO IS PULL THE CUE BALL BACK TOWARDS US
GbLshtiLaIs_4 0 IN OTHER WORDS IF WE HAD THIS SET UP RIGHT HERE IN OUR GAME OF EIGHT BALL ONCE AGAIN
GbLshtiLaIs_5 0 THIS IS MY LAST OBJECT BALL ON THE TABLE
GbLshtiLaIs_6 0 IF I POCKET THAT I'M ELIGIBLE TO SHOOT AT THE EIGHT TO WIN THE GAME
GbLshtiLaIs_7 0 BUT AGAIN IF I'M GOING TO STOP MY CUE BALL RIGHT THERE THAT'S NOT GOING TO GIVE ME A GOOD SHOT
GbLshtiLaIs_8 0 IF I FOLLOW ALONG BEHIND IT THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING FOR ME MY EIGHT BALL IS WAY OVER HERE
GbLshtiLaIs_9 0 SO I NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE CUE BALL TO BRING IT BACK TO GIVE ME AN EASY SHOT ON THE EIGHT BALL
GbLshtiLaIs_10 0 SO I HAVE TO DO THAT WITH A DRAW SHOT
GbLshtiLaIs_11 0 A DRAW SHOT AGAIN IS ONE WHERE I'M GOING TO POCKET THAT BALL AND I'M GOING TO MAKE THAT CUE BALL COME BACK TOWARDS ME

_G4VSczizuA_6 0 BY NOT THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF

_G4VSczizuA_8 0 THAT'S RIGHT THIRTY SECONDS AND THEN THEY START TO THINK ABOUT THEIR MOST FAVORITE SUBJECT AND THAT IS THEMSELVES
_G4VSczizuA_10 0 SO IF YOU WANT TO BE A JAY LENO OR A LETTERMAN OR WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO THINK OUTSIDE YOURSELF AND BE OUTGOING
_G4VSczizuA_11 0 WHAT'S FUNNY ABOUT THIS
_G4VSczizuA_12 0 WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THAT
_G4VSczizuA_13 0 AS LONG AS YOU'RE NARCISSISTIC AND YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOU'RE ONLY SATISFIED WITH THAT YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY BE OUTGOING
_G4VSczizuA_14 0 TO BE OUTGOING YOU NEED TO BE ON TOP OF SOMETHING OTHER THAN YOU
_G4VSczizuA_15 0 YOU HAVE TO BE OUTSIDE THAT THIRTY SECOND TIME FRAME AND EVERYBODY DOES IT IT'S A MATTER OF HUMAN NATURE
_G4VSczizuA_16 0 AND WHY DO WE LIKE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUTGOING
_G4VSczizuA_17 0 BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY'RE NOT CONSTANTLY THINKING ABOUT THEMSELVES IT'S A PIECE OF CAKE
_G4VSczizuA_18 0 THIS IS DR PAUL MAY YOUR FANTASIES OF TODAY BE YOUR REALITIES OF TOMORROW

h6NRkmIIEMo_7 0 I'VE SEEN PEOPLE POUR IT RIGHT IN LIKE THAT
h6NRkmIIEMo_8 0 JUST BE CAREFUL

GfI7QSFUSVU_2 0 IT IS THE INSTRUMENT THAT YOU LEARN YOUR BASIC FINGER TECHNIQUE ON THE BAGPIPE AND YOUR BASIC TUNES
GfI7QSFUSVU_3 0 SO BEFORE YOU BUY A BAGPIPE THIS IS WHAT YOU WOULD BUY
GfI7QSFUSVU_4 0 MOST OF THEM RUN IN THE $50 TO $80 RANGE AS OPPOSED TO $1 500 OR UP FOR A SET OF BAGPIPES

GQPJZ6_bodw_5 0 NOW WE ARE GOING TO USE THAT QUARTER AND ROTATE THAT CLOCKWISE TO TIGHTEN OUR DOOR VIEWER
GQPJZ6_bodw_6 0 NOW YOU MIGHT NEED TO HOLD ON TO THE GLASS PORTION OF THE OTHER SIDE OF IT SO THAT IT DOESN'T SPIN

H5o23-aXitU_1 0 HI MY NAME IS LAUREN AND I'M GOING TO DISCUSS HAIRCUTS FOR SKATER GIRLS
H5o23-aXitU_2 0 FOR SKATER GIRLS OR FOR THE LOOK IT IS VERY SOMEWHAT DISCONNECTED TASSELED LOOK
H5o23-aXitU_3 0 IT HAS A LOT OF TEXTURIZING GOING THROUGHOUT IT
H5o23-aXitU_4 0 USUALLY IT TENDS TO BE MORE OR LESS RAZOR CUTS OR JUST HEAVILY TEXTURIZED HAIRCUTS
H5o23-aXitU_5 0 YOU'RE GOING TO GO INTO YOUR STYLIST AND LET THEM KNOW THAT YOU DO WANT A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A DISCONNECT
H5o23-aXitU_6 0 IT'S VERY USUALLY HEAVILY LAYERED SO THAT WAY THERE'S MORE ROOM TO KIND OF PLAY WITH THE HAIR
H5o23-aXitU_7 0 AFTER YOU GET YOUR HAIRCUT YOU'RE ALREADY HALFWAY TOWARDS THE ACTUAL STYLE
H5o23-aXitU_8 0 ONCE YOU HAVE THE HAIRCUT AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY WORK WITH IT YOU'RE GOING TO USE A REGULAR BRUSH
H5o23-aXitU_9 0 AS YOU DRY YOUR HAIR AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO SIMPLY DO IT THE EXACT SAME WAY YOU WOULD IN HOW YOU WANT TO STYLE IT TO SIDE SWEEP IT OR ANYTHING ELSE AND YOU WOULD STRAIGHTEN IT EXACTLY HOW YOU'D LIKE
H5o23-aXitU_10 0 AT THE END IN ORDER TO REALLY CREATE THAT BIT OF THAT DISCONNECT AND A BIT OF THE VERY TEXTURED STYLE YOU'RE GOING TO USE MORE OF A TEXTURY CREAM CONSISTENCY
H5o23-aXitU_11 0 THIS IS THREADS BY SEBASTIAN
H5o23-aXitU_12 0 IT HAS ACTUAL THREADS IN IT WHICH IS GOING TO HELP GIVE YOU THAT VERY PIECY STYLE THAT THEY DO HAVE
H5o23-aXitU_13 0 A GOOD WAY TO KIND OF DO IT IS THEN TO GO THROUGH AND GRAB EACH SECTION WITH YOUR FINGERS AND REALLY KIND OF SEPARATE THOSE ENDS BECAUSE THE SKATER GIRL LOOK IS VERY MUCH ABOUT DISCONNECTION PIECINESS AND THAT HAIR IT'S LIKE YOU JUST WOKE UP AND THIS IS THE WAY IT WAS AND AS YOU CAN SEE EVEN WITH THIS HAIRCUT THE WAY THAT THERE IS THAT NICE DISCONNECT COMING FROM LIKE HERE TO HERE AND THAT VARYING LENGTH
H5o23-aXitU_14 0 IT REALLY DOES ADD SOMETHING TO THE HAIRCUT AND DOES HELP YOU ACHIEVE THAT VERY PIECY LOOK AND THAT IS HOW YOU GET A SKATER GIRLS HAIRCUT

GtPOx5tnjXw_10 0 HALF RHINO AND HALF ARMADILLO IS WHAT THIS GUY IS GOING TO KIND OF END UP LOOKING LIKE
GtPOx5tnjXw_11 0 SO WE DRAW THE SHELLS THERE IN THE BACK OF HIS BEETLE BODY AND THAT WILL PRETTY MUCH DO IT AS FAR AS THE BODY IS CONCERNED
GtPOx5tnjXw_12 0 WE CAN DRAW SOME ANTENNAS THAT ALSO LOOK LIKE RHINO ANTENNAS UP HERE
GtPOx5tnjXw_13 0 GIVE THEM LITTLE THINGIES ON TOP JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE ANTENNAS AND NOT HORNS
GtPOx5tnjXw_14 0 WE'LL COME RIGHT IN HERE AND DRAW SOME LITTLE NOSTRILS ON HIM AND YOU KNOW THIS GUY IS PRETTY MUCH HARMLESS I WOULD SAY BUT NONE THE LESS WE'LL COME IN HERE AND GIVE HIM A SORT OF FURROWED BROW AND YEAH I MEAN THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO GIVE LIKE ALL YOUR CHARACTERS PERSONALITY

GtPOx5tnjXw_18 0 THERE YOU GO
gnXwcRGTJd8_1 0 LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW TO TREAT YOUR DOG WITH AN EAR INFECTION
gnXwcRGTJd8_2 0 EAR INFECTIONS ARE VERY VERY COMMON FOR DOGS TO HAVE
gnXwcRGTJd8_3 0 IT HAS TO BE DIAGNOSED BY A VETERINARIAN FIRST TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT EAR
gnXwcRGTJd8_4 0 COULD BE A YEAST INFECTION OR A BACTERIAL INFECTION OR JUST LOTS OF INFLAMMATION FROM ALLERGY
gnXwcRGTJd8_5 0 SO THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE ARE TREATING
gnXwcRGTJd8_6 0 ONCE THE EAR INFECTION IS DIAGNOSED YOUR VETERINARIAN WILL PRESCRIBE YOU WITH A TYPE OF MEDICATION THAT WILL TREAT EITHER BACTERIA OR YEAST OR BOTH OR INFLAMMATION OF THE EAR
gnXwcRGTJd8_7 0 EAR MITES ARE SOMETHING THAT WE SEE A LOT OF TIMES TOO ESPECIALLY IN CATS AND SO YOUR VETERINARIAN WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH MEDICATION APPROPRIATELY TO TREAT THAT
gnXwcRGTJd8_8 0 YOUR VETERINARIAN ALSO MAY OR MAY NOT WANT YOU TO CLEAN THE EAR FIRST AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO APPLY A CLEANSER TO A GAUZE PAD AND THEN WITH YOUR FINGERTIP GO INSIDE THE EAR VERY GENTLY AND REMOVE ANY DEBRIS THAT MAY BE THERE FIRST
gnXwcRGTJd8_9 0 AFTER CLEANING THEN YOU CAN APPLY THE MEDICATION WHICH GENERALLY IS GOING TO BE MAYBE TAKE FIVE OR TEN DAYS IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT EAR
gnXwcRGTJd8_10 0 BUT JUST ALWAYS BE CAREFUL
gnXwcRGTJd8_11 0 EARS ARE VERY SENSITIVE AND DOGS DON'T NECESSARILY LIKE YOU MESSING WITH THEM TOO MUCH
G69U--sxHLM_1 0 HI I'M ROBERT
G69U--sxHLM_2 0 NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT DATA COMPRESSION IS
G69U--sxHLM_3 0 DATA COMPRESSION IS A WAY OF SAVING OR STORING DATA IN A VERY COMPACT MANNER
G69U--sxHLM_4 0 AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE MPEG OR WINZIP
G69U--sxHLM_5 0 WHAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU WANT TO SEND LET'S SAY AN ATTACHMENT BUT IT'S TOO LARGE A LOT OF E-MAIL SERVERS DO NOT ACCEPT VERY LARGE ATTACHMENTS SO YOU HAVE TO PUT IT INTO A WINZIPPED FILE IN ORDER TO TRANSPORT THAT TO THE RECEIVER OF THAT E-MAIL
G69U--sxHLM_6 0 AND WINZIP ALLOWS YOU TO MAKE THOSE FILES A LOT SMALLER THAN THE ORIGINAL FILES ARE
G69U--sxHLM_7 0 DATA COMPRESSION NOT ONLY HELP USERS SEND OUT LARGE FILES VIA E-MAIL BUT IT ALSO HELPS THEM MANAGE THEIR STORAGE MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY BECAUSE THE FILES ARE NOT SO LARGE AND IN ESSENCE IT SAVES THEM A LOT OF SPACE ON THEIR STORAGE
g6IaOMLjRzg_2 0 I'M VICKIE PAVONE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
g6IaOMLjRzg_3 0 IN THIS SERIES WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THE BASICS OF CROSS STITCHING
g6IaOMLjRzg_4 0 IN THIS SEGMENT YOUR PICTURE IS FINISHED WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW YOU FINISH IT
g6IaOMLjRzg_5 0 THE BASIC THING ONCE YOU'VE FINISHED IT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO WASH YOUR FABRIC
g6IaOMLjRzg_6 0 YOUR HANDS HAVE GOTTEN OILS ON THEM THAT YOU CAN'T SEE BUT OVER THE YEARS THOSE OILS WILL SHOW
g6IaOMLjRzg_7 0 THE BEST WAY TO WASH YOUR FABRIC IS IN COLD WATER HAND WASH WITH A MILD DISH DETERGENT
g6IaOMLjRzg_8 0 DO NOT USE FABRIC DETERGENT AND DO NOT USE ANYTHING LIKE THE DELICATE DETERGENTS BECAUSE IT MAKES THE COLORS BLEED
g6IaOMLjRzg_9 0 JUST A MILD DISH DETERGENT YOU PUT IT IN YOU SWISH IT AROUND A LITTLE LET IT SIT FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES TAKE IT OUT RINSE IT ROLL IT UP IN A TOWEL SQUEEZE THE LIQUID OUT OF IT AND THEN LET IT DRY FOR THE DAY
g6IaOMLjRzg_10 0 ONCE YOU'VE WASHED IT AND DRIED IT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO IRON IT BECAUSE YOU WANT YOUR PICTURE TO BE NICE AND FLAT
g6IaOMLjRzg_11 0 YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IT BETWEEN TWO TOWELS
g6IaOMLjRzg_12 0 PUT IT BETWEEN TWO TOWELS LAY IT DOWN SO THE PICTURE IS DOWN AND THEN JUST TAKE YOUR IRON AND IRON EVERYTHING NICE AND FLAT SO THAT YOU HAVE A NICE SMOOTH PICTURE
g6IaOMLjRzg_13 0 THE FINAL STEP WILL BE FRAMING
g6IaOMLjRzg_14 0 FRAMING CAN BE DONE BY ANY OF THE PROFESSIONAL SHOPS IN YOUR FABRIC STORES OR YOUR CRAFT STORES OR YOU CAN GO TO YOUR CRAFT STORE AND CHOOSE YOUR FAVORITE FRAME
g6IaOMLjRzg_15 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO FRAME IT YOURSELF YOU NEED A BACKING BOARD
g6IaOMLjRzg_16 0 IT NEEDS TO BE ACID FREE YOU CAN BUY THOSE IN THE SHOPS AS WELL
g6IaOMLjRzg_17 0 YOU PUT IT ON YOU STRETCH IT AROUND PUT YOUR FRAME OVER IT AND THERE YOU HAVE A FRAMED PICTURE

GK4qC_A4geQ_11 0 I STILL GOT A LITTLE BIT MORE OF SHAPING UP ON THIS NOSE THAT WOULD END UP BLEND IT RIGHT OFF
GK4qC_A4geQ_12 0 AND IF YOU DO HAVE ONE THAT IS GOING TO BE EXPOSED DON'T SHAPE INTO IT
GK4qC_A4geQ_13 0 JUST SHAPE OVER IT
GK4qC_A4geQ_14 0 IT'S BEST TO KEEP THE REST OF THE BOARD FLAT

ghp2hCIP128_2 0 THIS IS AN OPTION TOO BECAUSE SOMETIMES THERE'S ROCKS A ROCKY SHORELINE THAT WON'T ALLOW US TO SLIDE OFF INTO THE WATER

ghp2hCIP128_4 0 WE'RE ALSO GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO GET IN AND NOT USE YOUR PADDLE AS SOME MOST PEOPLE DO BECAUSE YOU MAY BREAK YOUR PADDLE IT'S NOT GOOD

hf_moWbbfUI_1 0 HI I'M KELLY AN AESTHETICIAN AND MAKEUP ARTIST AT ULTA SALON COSMETICS AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME TIPS ON HOW YOU CAN GET RID OF DARK CIRCLES UNDER THE EYE
hf_moWbbfUI_2 0 ONE OF THE EASIEST THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO IS USE A REALLY GREAT TREATMENT FOR DARK CIRCLES
hf_moWbbfUI_3 0 THIS HAS A YELLOW TINT TO IT
hf_moWbbfUI_4 0 YELLOW IS A REALLY GREAT COUNTER-ACTIVE TO BLUES AND PURPLES AROUND THE EYE AREA WHICH TYPICALLY IS THE COLOR THAT YOU SEE WITH YOUR DARK CIRCLES AND THAT'S JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE THE SKIN AROUND THE EYES IS SO THIN AND WE HAVE A LOT OF BLOOD VESSELS REALLY CLOSE TO THE SURFACE
hf_moWbbfUI_5 0 SO WHAT YOU CAN DO IS JUST TAKE A LITTLE BIT ON YOUR RING FINGER PAD IT AROUND THE ORBITAL BONE AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO MASSAGE IN A CIRCULAR MOTION CLOCKWISE
hf_moWbbfUI_6 0 THIS IS A LYMPHATIC DRAINAGE MOVE
hf_moWbbfUI_7 0 THIS HELPS TO STIMULATE CIRCULATION AROUND THE EYE ALSO TO DRAIN ANY CONGESTION
hf_moWbbfUI_8 0 PLUS THIS TREATMENT CREAM HAS SOME INSTANT BRIGHTENING EFFECTS TO IT
hf_moWbbfUI_9 0 IT HAS THE INSTANT YELLOW TINT THAT'S GOING TO COUNTERACT DARKNESS
hf_moWbbfUI_10 0 PLUS OVER TIME IT'S GOING TO HELP TO THICKEN THE SKIN AROUND THE IRIS AND HYDRATE AND IT'S ALSO GOING TO HELP STIMULATE CIRCULATION
hf_moWbbfUI_11 0 IT HAS CAFFEINE IN IT TO STIMULATE CIRCULATION AROUND THE EYE AREA TO HELP COUNTERACT THE DARK CIRCLES
hf_moWbbfUI_12 0 SO THOSE ARE SOME TIPS OF HOW YOU CAN GET RID OF DARK CIRCLES
hFHolYcaJew_1 0 MY NAME IS OWEN ROTH AND IN THIS CLIP I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO CHOOSE A GOOD OUTDOOR LOCATION FOR A VIDEO INTERVIEW
hFHolYcaJew_2 0 OKAY SO THERE'S A FEW THINGS YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHEN CHOOSING YOUR LOCATION FOR AN OUTDOOR INTERVIEW
hFHolYcaJew_3 0 ONE IS THE SUN THE WEATHER BECAUSE IN BAD WEATHER OBVIOUSLY RAIN IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOME TYPE OF OVERHANG AND PROTECTION
hFHolYcaJew_4 0 BUT ALSO WHAT TYPE OF WEATHER YOU'RE GOING TO BE EXPECTING WHETHER IT'S CLOUDY OR HARSH CLEAR SKIES LIKE THIS WITH HARSH SUNLIGHT BECAUSE THAT WILL DICTATE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO BRING WHETHER IT MIGHT BE AN UMBRELLA OR REFLECTORS OR THINGS LIKE THAT
hFHolYcaJew_5 0 SO LIGHTING IS ONE THING AND THAT WILL ALSO MIGHT DICTATE WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO PUT YOUR INTERVIEWEE
hFHolYcaJew_6 0 YOU'RE GOING TO ALWAYS WANT THE SUN BEHIND YOU IF IT'S A HARSH LIGHT LIKE NOW
hFHolYcaJew_7 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO THINK OF WHAT'S GOING TO BE BEHIND THE INTERVIEWEE BASED ON WHERE THAT SUNLIGHT'S GOING TO BE
hFHolYcaJew_8 0 SO FOR ME I WOULD PLACE MY INTERVIEWEE RIGHT HERE IN THIS CHAIR AND I WOULD JUST BE IN FRONT OF THEM INTERVIEWING THEM
hFHolYcaJew_9 0 SO THE BACKGROUND WOULD BE THIS AND THAT WILL CREATE A NICE BACKGROUND LOTS OF VEGETATION NOTHING UGLY SO THAT SHOULD BE NICE AND THE SUN'S BEHIND ME
hFHolYcaJew_10 0 SO THAT'S HOW I WOULD SET THAT UP SO YOU WANT TO THINK OF WHAT'S BEHIND THE SUBJECT AND HOW COMFORTABLE THEY'RE GOING TO BE SITTING IN THE DIRECT SUNLIGHT BECAUSE THEY MIGHT NOT WANT TO TALK FOR TWENTY MINUTES IF THEY'RE JUST SITTING IN UNBEARABLE HEAT
hFHolYcaJew_11 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO KEEP THESE THINGS IN MIND WHEN PICKING THE SPOT
hFHolYcaJew_12 0 ANOTHER THING OBVIOUSLY IS NOISE
hFHolYcaJew_13 0 WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE LIKE
hFHolYcaJew_14 0 ARE THERE NOISY NEIGHBORS
hFHolYcaJew_15 0 IS IT A NOISY NEIGHBORHOOD
hFHolYcaJew_16 0 ARE THERE PLANES FLYING OVERHEAD
hFHolYcaJew_17 0 AND YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO WANT TO SCOUT THE LOCATION BEFORE YOU CHOOSE IT
hFHolYcaJew_18 0 AND SCOUT IT AT THE TIME THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SCHEDULE THE INTERVIEW FOR NOT A DIFFERENT DAY NOT IN THE MORNING AT NIGHT AT A DIFFERENT TIME BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE THERE AT THE TIME WHEN YOU'RE SCOUTING IT YOU WANT TO BE THERE AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO HAVE THE INTERVIEW SO YOU KNOW WHAT NOISES CAN AND WILL OCCUR THERE BECAUSE A NOISY LOCATION IS NO GOOD
hFHolYcaJew_19 0 AND THAT MIGHT ALSO DICTATE WHAT TYPE OF AUDIO YOU CHOOSE TO DO WHETHER IT'S A SHOTGUN OR A LAPEL
hFHolYcaJew_20 0 SO THERE'S MANY FACTORS THAT COME INTO CHOOSING A GOOD OUTDOOR LOCATION
hFHolYcaJew_21 0 LIKE I SAID THIS ONE IS IDEAL FOR ME BECAUSE IT'S IN A QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD I'VE GOT THE SHADE OF THIS UMBRELLA IF I NEED IT AND I CAN POP THAT OVER AND I'M KIND OF RIGHT HERE WITH A NICE BACKGROUND
hFHolYcaJew_22 0 SO THIS IS A GOOD LOCATION FOR WHAT I WANT BUT IT MAY BE DIFFERENT FOR YOU

h3xgXVeym7U_14 0 DON'T FORGET YOUR COMB TOO WITH THE LITTLE END ON IT
GxWLhv-Vt78_1 0 A MOVIE STAR IS A WORKING ACTOR THAT'S BEEN ELEVATED TO THE STATUS OF A MOVE STAR BY THE PUBLIC AND THE FANS THAT WATCH MOVIES
GxWLhv-Vt78_2 0 MOVIE STARS AREN'T TYPICALLY MADE IN THEIR FIRST TIME OUT OF THE GATE SO TO SPEAK BUT THEY ARE ELEVATED TO THE STATUS OF A HEAVENLY BODY AS IT WERE BY THE PEOPLE THAT ENJOY AND APPRECIATE MOVIE MOVIES IN GENERAL
GxWLhv-Vt78_3 0 MOVIE STARS TYPICALLY ARE AT THE TOP OF THEIR GAME THEY'RE GREAT ENTERTAINERS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE A MOVIE STAR IN A MOVIE IT ELEVATES THE MOVIE TO A RAREFIED STATUS USUALLY THAT PEOPLE CAN GENERALLY GUARANTEE THEMSELVES WHEN THEY LAY DOWN THE MONEY AT THE BOX OFFICE THEY'RE GOING TO ENJOY THEMSELVES TO SEE THIS PERSON OR THEY'VE DEVELOPED A RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS PERSON OR PERSONS OVER THE YEARS FROM WATCHING THEM AND ENJOYING THEIR PERFORMANCES
GxWLhv-Vt78_4 0 THE MOVIE STAR TERMINOLOGY IS KIND OF STRANGE IN GENERAL LIKE I SAID I GUESS THE STARS BEING THE HIGHEST THAT A PERSON CAN GO SINCE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE LIMITS OF OUR UNIVERSE
GxWLhv-Vt78_5 0 I DON'T KNOW MAYBE A MOVIE PLANET YOUR A MOVIE PLANET DOESN'T SOUND TO GOOD BUT MOVIE STAR ACTUALLY SOUNDS LIKE OOOH SHINY YA THAT SORT OF THING AND ALL THE EMBELLISHMENT AND GLOSSINESS THAT GOES WITH IT
GxWLhv-Vt78_6 0 BUT MOVIE STARS TYPICALLY ARE THE ONES THAT GET A MOVE MADE AND THEY ARE HIRED BY THE DIRECTORS AND THE STUDIOS THAT WANT TO INSURE THAT THIS PRODUCT IS GIVEN EVERY BEST CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING
GxWLhv-Vt78_7 0 SO THE MORE MOVIE STARS YOU HAVE IN YOUR PROJECT GENERALLY HAS THE BETTER CHANCE IT HAS OF SUCCEEDING
GxWLhv-Vt78_8 0 A TYPICAL DAY OF A MOVIE ACTOR IT MEANS GETTING UP VERY EARLY GOING TO THE SET GETTING MADE UP HOPEFULLY NOT AFTER UNTIL YOU GET A CUP OF COFFEE AND SITTING IN A MAKE UP CHAIR AND GETTING YOUR FACE POWDERED AND YOUR LITTLE THINGS WIPED OUT OF YOUR EYES THAT HAVE ACCUMULATED THERE OVERNIGHT SOMETIMES IT'S RATHER EMBARRASSING AND THEN YOU GO TO THE HAIR DEPARTMENT AND THEY OF COURSE ADJUST YOUR HAIR OR IN MY CASE THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT TO DO SO I'M PRETTY MUCH JUST MAKE UP AND OUT THE DOOR
GxWLhv-Vt78_9 0 BUT THEN YOU GO TO THE SET AND HAVE A WALK THROUGH OR A REHEARSAL FOR THE SCENE WHICH YOU'RE GOING TO DO FIRST AND THEN THE LIGHTING CREW THE GRIPS COME IN AND THEY LIGHT THE SCENE AND YOU TALK TO THE DIRECTOR ABOUT MAYBE CONCERNS OR PROBLEMS YOU'RE HAVING YOU KNOW WITH THE WAY THE BLOCKING IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER CHARACTER WITHIN THE SCENE
GxWLhv-Vt78_10 0 AND THEN YOU WAIT AROUND AND THEN YOU SHOOT THE SCENE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER
GIH2PlF-rfY_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO LEARN ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF CONTINUITY WITHOUT INTERRUPTION

HfCi4kYOYW0_1 0 OKAY I'M GOING TO GIVE GARY A SERVE AND HE'S GOING TO ATTACK OFF THE SERVE WITH A DROP VOLLEY OR A DROP OR AN ATTACK AND VOLLEY
HfCi4kYOYW0_2 0 HIS GOAL IS TO HIT IT RIGHT ABOVE THE TEN EITHER REAL SOFT SO IT JUST COMES OUT AS A WINNING DROP SHOT OR HE'S GOING TO ATTACK THE NECK
HfCi4kYOYW0_3 0 SO THIS IS A REALLY GOOD SERVE RETURN TO HAVE IN YOUR ARSENAL
HfCi4kYOYW0_4 0 COUNTLESS TIMES YOUR OPPONENT'S NOT READY FOR AN ATTACKING VOLLEY RETURN OR A DROP
HfCi4kYOYW0_5 0 SO IF YOU DO IT EVERY TIME THEY MIGHT BE READY FOR IT
HfCi4kYOYW0_6 0 SO I'M GOING TO SERVE TO GARY'S FOREHAND AND HE'S GOING TO GO RIGHT AT THAT CORNER

HfCi4kYOYW0_8 0 OKAY NOW THAT'S THE RISK YOU ALWAYS RUN IS TINNING A BALL IF YOU GO FOR A WINNER
HfCi4kYOYW0_9 0 THAT'S A TOUGH SHOT
HfCi4kYOYW0_10 0 NOW HOWEVER IF IN SQUASH THE SERVE THAT'S A GREAT SERVE RETURN WE GOT IT IN THE NECK IN SQUASH THE RETURN CAN BE A REALLY GAME CHANGER BECAUSE I CAN'T DO TOO MUCH WITH A SERVE
HfCi4kYOYW0_11 0 THAT'S A GREAT SHOT GARY
HfCi4kYOYW0_12 0 SO WATCH HOW HE PREPARES
HfCi4kYOYW0_13 0 HE GETS THE RACKET READY
HfCi4kYOYW0_14 0 OKAY SO IN THIS GAME SQUASH HAVING A GOOD SERVE RETURN IS REALLY AN INCREDIBLY GREAT SKILL
HfCi4kYOYW0_15 0 SO GARY DID A GREAT DEMONSTRATION AND IF YOU PRACTICE THIS SHOT YOU'LL SEE A MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN YOUR RESULTS
gJZ2ngS56J0_1 0 MY NAME IS BRENT SHELLY WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT LIGHTING DESIGN TODAY
gJZ2ngS56J0_2 0 THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT REASONS TO HAVE A LIGHTING DESIGNER ON YOUR PROJECT
gJZ2ngS56J0_3 0 ONE IS AGAIN LIKE I HAVE MENTIONED EARLIER LIGHTING DESIGN IS THE FOURTH DIMENSION OF ARCHITECTURE
gJZ2ngS56J0_4 0 DAYLIGHT DURING THE DAY IN A SPACE HELPS TO REVEAL ARCHITECTURAL FORM
gJZ2ngS56J0_5 0 AT NIGHT WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE LIGHT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO USE ELECTRIC LIGHT TO DO THAT
gJZ2ngS56J0_6 0 A LIGHTING DESIGNER CAN HELP TO CREATE THE MAGIC IN A SPACE
gJZ2ngS56J0_7 0 THEY CAN HELP TO REVEAL THE FORM AND HELP TO MAKE THAT A SPACE THAT PEOPLE WANT TO BE IN
gJZ2ngS56J0_8 0 LIGHTING IS A VERY SPECIALIZED FIELD
gJZ2ngS56J0_9 0 THERE ARE OVER 5,000 DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT
gJZ2ngS56J0_10 0 IT TAKES SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS WHEN TO USE WHAT LIGHT BULBS IN WHAT FIXTURES AND WHEN TO APPLY THOSE AND HOW TO APPLY THOSE TO SPACE TO BE ABLE TO NOT ONLY CREATE THAT MAGIC BUT ALSO TO GET ENOUGH LIGHT
gJZ2ngS56J0_11 0 LIGHTING IS FOR PEOPLE
gJZ2ngS56J0_12 0 IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH LIGHTING FOR THEM TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WHETHER THAT IS READING CONVERSING OVER DINNER THEN THE JOB IS NOT DONE CORRECTLY

gjexrkXhRQM_1 0 THIS IS OAK AT THE PAINTED TEMPLE TATTOO IN PROVO AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ANCIENT TATTOOING TECHNIQUES
gjexrkXhRQM_2 0 TATTOOINGS HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS
gjexrkXhRQM_3 0 WE'VE USED ANYTHING FROM BONE TO WOOD YOU NAME IT YOU KNOW TEETH
gjexrkXhRQM_4 0 WE'VE BEEN HAVING THIS URGE OR THIS PRIMAL URGE IN US TO TATTOO OURSELVES FOR CENTURIES AND CENTURIES
gjexrkXhRQM_5 0 YOU KNOW PEOPLE FROM BORNEO AND INDONESIA THEY'VE BEEN TATTOOING EACH OTHER FOR A LONG TIME
gjexrkXhRQM_6 0 YOU KNOW THE POLYNESIANS THE PEOPLE FROM NEW ZEALAND THE MAORI THEY'VE BEEN TATTOOING THEMSELVES HEAVILY FOR MANY YEARS DEPICTS AS WELL IT'S AN ANCIENT TRADITION AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY ANYTIME SOON AND IT STARTED A LONG TIME AGO
gjexrkXhRQM_7 0 IT'S DESIRE YOU KNOW
gjexrkXhRQM_8 0 HERE I HAVE AN OLD TATTOO BOX FROM BORNEO
gjexrkXhRQM_9 0 THIS IS A TATTOO SETUP FOR THE UNITY OF A MARRIED COUPLE BASICALLY AND THIS IS WHAT THIS WAS USED FOR
gjexrkXhRQM_10 0 THE INK WOULD BE PUT IN HERE AND THEN IT WOULD BE POUND DOWN WITH ANOTHER STICK I DON'T HAVE THAT WITH ME SADLY TO SAY
gjexrkXhRQM_11 0 BUT THEY WOULD MAKE THAT IN HERE
gjexrkXhRQM_12 0 THEN HERE ON THE BOTTOM IT HAS THE TATTOOING TOOLS
gjexrkXhRQM_13 0 HERE IS A STAMP THEY WOULD USE THEY WOULD PUT THIS IN INK AND THEY'D APPLY THIS TO THE SKIN ALMOST LIKE A STENCIL
gjexrkXhRQM_14 0 IT'S GOT A BUTTERFLY ON IT IT'S THE SYMBOL FOR THE BORNEO FOR UNITY
gjexrkXhRQM_15 0 THIS HAS BEEN MODIFIED A LITTLE BIT IT'S NOT IN IT'S TRADITIONAL FORM THESE WERE NOT THESE KIND OF NEEDLES BEFORE BUT HERE IS BASICALLY THE TOOL TO APPLY THE INK
gjexrkXhRQM_16 0 AND THIS WOULD BE USED AS SUCH AND YOU WOULD JUST KIND OF TAP IN YOUR SKIN LIKE THIS
gjexrkXhRQM_17 0 AND THIS IS PRETTY MUCH THE ANCIENT METHOD OF TATTOOING
gjexrkXhRQM_18 0 IN JAPAN THEY WOULD USE YOU KNOW HAND POKE BUT BORNEO THE SMALL ONES THEY WOULD DO A TAPPING
gjexrkXhRQM_19 0 THE TATAU MEANS TO TAP LITERALLY AND THAT WAS DONE BY THE MAORI AND THE POLYNESIANS AS WELL
gjHeEPqP6AY_1 0 HEY FIRST THING WE WANT TO DO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LISTENING IS TALK ABOUT NOISE
gjHeEPqP6AY_2 0 NOW WHAT'S NOISE
gjHeEPqP6AY_3 0 WELL NOISE IS A LOT OF THINGS
gjHeEPqP6AY_4 0 BUT THERE'S TWO SPECIFIC KINDS OF NOISE THAT REALLY GETS IN OUR WAY WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO BE GOOD LISTENERS INTERNAL NOISE AND EXTERNAL NOISE
gjHeEPqP6AY_6 0 EXTERNAL NOISE IS THE BUS THAT GOES BY WHILE YOU'RE YOU KNOW OUTSIDE WHEN IT BURRR BURRR BEEP BEEP HEY
gjHeEPqP6AY_7 0 THAT'S EXTERNAL NOISE
gjHeEPqP6AY_8 0 OR MAYBE THE AIR CONDITIONER KICKS AND BRRRR THAT KICKS ON
gjHeEPqP6AY_9 0 OR A HARLEY DAVIDSON MOTORCYCLE DRIVES BY
gjHeEPqP6AY_10 0 WHATEVER NOISE IS OUT THERE
gjHeEPqP6AY_11 0 SOMEBODY WALKS IN RIGHT NOW AND SLAMS THIS DOOR I'VE GOT SOME EXTERNAL NOISE THAT'S AFFECTING MY ABILITY TO LISTEN
gjHeEPqP6AY_12 0 THEN THERE'S INTERNAL NOISE
gjHeEPqP6AY_13 0 INTERNAL NOISE IS I'M SO HUNGRY MY STOMACH IS RUMBLING
gjHeEPqP6AY_14 0 I AM SO GOING TO KILL HER FOR BORROWING MY SWEATER
gjHeEPqP6AY_15 0 OKAY THAT'S ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
gjHeEPqP6AY_16 0 OR MAYBE YOU GOT INTO A FIGHT WITH YOUR HUSBAND OR YOUR WIFE OR YOUR BOYFRIEND OR YOUR GIRLFRIEND OR YOUR WIFE OR YOUR HUSBAND OR ALL OF THE ABOVE
gjHeEPqP6AY_17 0 MAYBE YOU'RE TIRED MAYBE YOU'RE COLD GET YOUR RED SWEATER
gjHeEPqP6AY_18 0 ANYTHING THAT'S GOING ON INTERNALLY THAT'S AFFECTING YOU FROM BEING ABLE TO LISTEN
gjHeEPqP6AY_19 0 ARE THESE THINGS CONTROLLABLE A WHOLE LOT OF THEM ARE ESPECIALLY THE INTERNAL ONES
gjHeEPqP6AY_20 0 BUT WE HAVE TO GET TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN BLOCK THEM OUT AND FOCUS
gjHeEPqP6AY_21 0 FOCUS ON THE MESSAGE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO RECEIVE
gjHeEPqP6AY_22 0 AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES A GOOD LISTENER
GADB6E0qat4_1 0 HI MY NAME IS ERICA GAMS AND I'M HERE IN SALT LAKE CITY UT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MYSPACE ON THE INTERNET AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO BLOCK A USER THAT IS HARASSING YOU ON MYSPACE

goyXJUwUyCE_1 0 IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO CHANGE THE SETTINGS ON YOUR MASTER CHANNEL AND AUTOMATE SETTINGS IN THE MASTER CHANNEL
goyXJUwUyCE_2 0 SO AGAIN LIKE ALL THESE OTHER PERIMETERS YOU CAN EDIT VIA THE MIXING OR THE EDITING WINDOW
goyXJUwUyCE_3 0 THE MIXING WINDOW IS A LITTLE HARDER
goyXJUwUyCE_4 0 ITS A LITTLE MORE
goyXJUwUyCE_5 0 ITS HARD TO BE SMOOTH BECAUSE YOU'RE MOVING IT WITH A MOUSE UNLESS YOU HAVE AN EXTERNAL MIXING INTERFACE
goyXJUwUyCE_6 0 AND AGAIN YOU HAVE THE READ TOUCH LEFT RIGHT OPTIONS
goyXJUwUyCE_7 0 AND ANY PLUG-IN THAT YOU HAVE ON THE MASTER CHANNEL SAY A COMPRESSION OR A LIMITING PLUG-IN WILL STILL BE SHOWN IN THE ACTUAL MASTER CHANNEL ON THE MIXING WINDOW OR THE EDITING WINDOW
goyXJUwUyCE_8 0 SO THAT YOU CAN STILL DRAW IN AND CHANGE VOLUMES ON THE MASTER CHANNEL
goyXJUwUyCE_9 0 AS YOU CAN SEE AT THE END OF THIS TRACK I'VE DONE A FADE-OUT VIA DRAWING IN ON THE MASTER CHANNEL
goyXJUwUyCE_10 0 THAT MAKES IT VERY EASY SO THAT YOU CAN SPECIFICALLY SAY WHEN YOU WANT THE TRACK TO END WHEN YOU WANT THE FADE- OUT TO START
goyXJUwUyCE_11 0 SAME WITH THE FADE-IN
goyXJUwUyCE_12 0 DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT ALLOW YOU TO REALLY MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THINGS HAPPENING EXACTLY WHERE YOU WANT THEM TO START AND END WITH THE MASTER CHANNEL
gOjCrsdx9S8_1 0 HI IM KELLI ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE IM GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME TIPS AND TECHNIQUES THAT I USE WHEN CONCEALING DARK CIRCLES UNDER THE EYES
gOjCrsdx9S8_2 0 SO THERES SOME DIFFERENT TOOLS THAT YOU CAN USE WHEN YOU ARE APPLYING YOUR CONCEALER
gOjCrsdx9S8_3 0 OF COURSE A GREAT TOOL IS ALWAYS VERY ACCESSIBLE TO YOU IS YOUR FINGERS
gOjCrsdx9S8_4 0 YOU JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU ARE WORKING AROUND THE EYE AREA YOU'RE USING JUST YOUR RING FINGER SO YOU PULL OR TARGET THE EYE AREA
gOjCrsdx9S8_5 0 AND YOU ALSO WANNA WORK IN JUST A LIGHT PATTING MOTION
gOjCrsdx9S8_6 0 YOU NEVER WANNA RUB A CONCEALER CAUSE YOU GONNA END UP RUBBING IT RIGHT OFF
gOjCrsdx9S8_7 0 SO YOU JUST WANNA KIND OF PAT IT INTO THE SKIN SO IT WILL COVER WHERE YOU NEED IT WILL COVER
gOjCrsdx9S8_8 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE A CONCEALER BRUSH WHICH LOOKS LIKE THIS CONCEALER BRUSH ARE USUALLY MADE FROM SYNTHETIC BRISTLES THAT WILL BE A LITTLE BIT STIFFER SO YOU CAN USE THIS IN A PATTING MOTION TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE COVERAGE
gOjCrsdx9S8_9 0 OR SOME PEOPLE WILL LIKE TO USE SPONGE THIS IS JUST A PLAYTEX FREE SPONGE WEDGE AND YOU CAN USE THAT TO PAT AND COVER
gOjCrsdx9S8_10 0 IF YOU HAVE MORE EXTREME AREAS THAT YOU NEED A LITTLE BIT HEAVIER COVERAGE ON SOMETIMES A SPONGE WILL WORK A LITTLE BIT BETTER FOR YOU BECAUSE IT WILL HOLD A LITTLE BIT MORE CONCENTRATION OF PRODUCT IN THERE THEN YOU CAN PAT IT ON
gOjCrsdx9S8_11 0 SO THESE ARE JUST A FEW DIFFERENT TYPE OF TOOLS THAT YOU CAN USE WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO CONCEAL AND BASE ON HOW MUCH COVERAGE YOU NEED OR WHAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE IN WORKING WITH THAT WILL LEAD YOU TO WHAT TYPE OF TOOL THAT YOU NEED TO USE
gOjCrsdx9S8_12 0 SO THOSE ARE A FEW OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU CAN APPLY CONCEALER
gPTIs7lGMvM_1 0 MY NAME IS JARED TODD AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO APPLY YOUR PATTERN TO THE STEEL TO GET READY TO PROFILE THE BLADE
gPTIs7lGMvM_2 0 HOW I APPLY MY PATTERNS IS AFTER I SKETCH OUT MY PATTERN AND GET IT AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE TO WHAT I WANT I HAVE A IT'S A SPRAY ADHESIVE IT'S LIKE LIQUID SCOTCH TAPE IT'S IN A CAN
gPTIs7lGMvM_3 0 I SPRAY IT TO THE BACK OF THE PIECE OF PAPER THAT HAS MY PATTERN ON THE OTHER SIDE THEN I STICK IT ON THE STEEL SO THAT IT'S STUCK ON THERE PRETTY GOOD
gPTIs7lGMvM_4 0 THEN WHAT I DO TO WATERPROOF THE PAPER SO THAT IT DOESN'T WEAR AWAY WHILE I'M GRINDING IS I'VE FOUND THAT IN THE HARDWARE STORE THERE'S A WOOD HARDENER MADE BY MINOWICK THAT I JUST PUT A COUPLE COATS ON HERE AND IT HARDENS IT AND SEALS IT FROM WATER
gPTIs7lGMvM_5 0 THE KNIFE DOES GET HOT WHEN I GRIND IT AND SO I NEED TO DIP IT IN THE WATER SO THAT IT CAN COOL IT DOWN
gPTIs7lGMvM_6 0 SOME PEOPLE DON'T USE THIS TYPE OF TECHNIQUE
gPTIs7lGMvM_7 0 THEY USE THEY GET THIS BLUE TYPE OF PAINT
gPTIs7lGMvM_8 0 IT'S A LAYOUT PAINT
gPTIs7lGMvM_9 0 THEY PAINT IT ON THE PIECE OF STEEL THAT THEY WANT THEN THEY'LL PUT THEIR PATTERN DOWN AND THEN THEY'LL USE A METAL SCRIBE OR A SHARP OBJECT AND THEY'LL SCRIBE THROUGH THE PAINT ONTO THE STEEL
gPTIs7lGMvM_10 0 SOME PREFER THAT OTHER THAN USING THE PAPER METHOD
gPTIs7lGMvM_11 0 I FIND THAT THE PAPER METHOD WORKS THE BEST FOR ME BECAUSE ONCE I GET MY PATTERN DRAWN OUT I GO TO THE COPY CENTER AND I MAKE AS MANY COPIES AS I NEED
gPTIs7lGMvM_12 0 THE DISADVANTAGE OF IT IS THAT YOU KNOW IT WILL WEAR OFF IF YOU RUB ON IT TOO HARD
gPTIs7lGMvM_13 0 BUT IT COMES RIGHT OFF WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH YOUR KNIFE
gPTIs7lGMvM_14 0 YOU CAN PEEL IT OFF
gPTIs7lGMvM_15 0 SOME PEOPLE JUST TAKE A MARKER AND THEY'LL JUST DRAW THEIR PATTERN RIGHT ON THE STEEL
gPTIs7lGMvM_16 0 JUST BY HAND

_gmqSxZ0I4s_1 0 HI THIS IS JOHN MICHAELS WITH EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO BUY A USED CAR
_gmqSxZ0I4s_2 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SALVAGE TITLES
_gmqSxZ0I4s_3 0 IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD TYPICALLY SEE IN A DEALERSHIP YOU CAN HOWEVER RUN INTO A CAR THAT HAS BEEN DESTROYED THERE AND THEN PUT BACK TOGETHER WHEN YOU ARE OUT THERE BUYING FROM A PRIVATE PARTY SO BE SURE THAT YOU REMEMBER SALVAGE TITLES ARE NOT THE KIND OF CAR THAT YOU WANT TO OWN
_gmqSxZ0I4s_4 0 YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PROBLEMS THAT YOU MAY END UP WITH IN THE FUTURE AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST THAT YOU RUN AWAY FROM
_gmqSxZ0I4s_5 0 SO GET OUT THERE WHEN YOU LOOK AND FIND OUT FROM YOUR PRIVATE BUYER OR SELLER WHETHER OR NOT THE CAR THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT HAS A SALVAGE TITLE
_gmqSxZ0I4s_6 0 REMEMBER MOST DEALERSHIPS CAN'T SELL OR RESELL A CAR THAT HAS A SALVAGE TITLE SO YOU ARE USUALLY SAFE THERE HOWEVER WHEN SHOPPING FOR A CAR FROM A PRIVATE PARTY MAKE SURE THAT YOU FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THE CAR HAS A SALVAGE TITLE
_gmqSxZ0I4s_7 0 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY SO IN THE LONG RUN BE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ASKED THAT QUESTION WHEN BUYING A USED CAR

GC9F_81pV0g_2 0 YOU HAVE INCREASED YOUR HEART RATE AND IT WAS AT THAT ELEVATED POSITION FOR A GOOD HALF HOUR TO 45 MINUTES AND NOW YOU NEED TO BRING IT BACK DOWN SLOWLY
GC9F_81pV0g_3 0 A NICE WALK ON A TREADMILL OR ANY OTHER EXERCISE WILL SLOWLY DECREASE YOUR HEART RATE AND IT IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEART AND GOOD FOR YOUR BODY
GC9F_81pV0g_4 0 MAKE SURE YOU DON'T GET SHOCKED INTO THAT COOLING FEELING
GC9F_81pV0g_5 0 FOR YOUR STRETCHING YOU ARE GOING TO PERFORM A SIMILAR EXERCISE TO WHAT YOU DID BEFORE SO CARRIE HERE IS GOING TO INTERLACE HER FINGERS
GC9F_81pV0g_6 0 SHE IS GOING TO ROLL HER PALMS AWAY FROM HER BODY AND SHE IS GOING TO EXTEND HER ARMS OUT AND LOCK THOSE ELBOWS AND KIND OF ROLL IT HER BACK A LITTLE BIT
GC9F_81pV0g_7 0 THIS IS GOING TO GIVE HER A NICE PULL ON THAT BICEP DOWN THROUGH THE FOREARM AND WORK THOSE WRISTS THAT WE WERE WORKING A LITTLE BIT EARLIER
GC9F_81pV0g_8 0 SHE IS BREATHING THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE EXERCISE AND THEN SHE IS GOING TO SWITCH TO WHERE SHE PUTS HER HANDS BEHIND HER BACK
GC9F_81pV0g_9 0 THIS IS A NICE CHEST STRETCH SO SHE IS GOING TO PULL HER ARMS UP
GC9F_81pV0g_10 0 IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE AT HOME THAT CAN HELP YOU WITH THIS EXERCISE I CAN ACTUALLY APPLY PRESSURE UNTIL SHE FEELS THAT TENSION AND MAKES IT A LITTLE EASIER FOR HER AND THEN SHE CAN TELL ME WHEN SHE IS THERE AND THEN WE WOULD RELEASE AND THEN THE LAST STEP SHE WILL BE UP AND OVER HER HEAD AND SHE WILL DO THAT TRICEP STRETCH
GC9F_81pV0g_11 0 GRABBING THE OPPOSITE TRICEP WITH HER HAND

H1mkGdf1ReM_1 0 HI MY NAME IS DAN SCHMIDT FROM THE CHINESE MARTIAL ARTS CENTER IN SEMINOLE AND TODAY IN THIS CLIP WE ARE GOING TO BE PERFORMING THE OVERHEAD BLOCK
H1mkGdf1ReM_2 0 SO FOR THIS TYPE OF BLOCK YOU WANT TO START WITH THE THUMB TO THUMB GRIP
H1mkGdf1ReM_3 0 YOU GRIP IN THE MIDDLE SLIDE EACH HAND OUT ABOUT SHOULDER WIDTH
H1mkGdf1ReM_4 0 FROM HERE THE TYPE OF BLOCK YOU WANT TO PRESS UP OVERHEAD YOU CAN STEP BACK AND HAVE IT GOING STRAIGHT ACROSS THIS WAY
H1mkGdf1ReM_5 0 SO IT IS PRETTY SIMPLE JUST STEP STRAIGHT BACK AND HAVE IT GOING UPWARDS
H1mkGdf1ReM_6 0 ALSO DEPENDING ON THE TECHNIQUE THAT THE OPPONENT IS USING YOU ALSO WANT TO PRESS STRAIGHT UP AND HAVE THE STAFF SLIGHTLY OFF TO AN ANGLE THIS WAY SO SAME THING YOU STEP BACK BRING IT UP OFF TO AN ANGLE AND HERE IS WHY
H1mkGdf1ReM_7 0 SO IF THEY SMASH STRAIGHT OVERHEAD THIS WAY IF YOU BLOCK STRAIGHT LIKE THIS AND YOU DON'T HAVE A VERY STRONG GRIP IT WILL PRESS STRAIGHT DOWN AND SMASH YOUR OWN WEAPON INTO YOU PLUS THEIRS
H1mkGdf1ReM_8 0 SO ONCE AGAIN IF YOU ARE GOING LIKE THIS THIS ONE ISN'T TOO GOOD ALL THE TIME
H1mkGdf1ReM_9 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TILT THE STAFF TO AN ANGLE SO THEY SMASH GO UP THIS WAY AND NATURALLY THE STAFF DIVERTS TO THE SIDE AND FROM HERE YOU GO IN WITH WHATEVER TECHNIQUE YOU WANT TO USE SO ONCE AGAIN ONE FROM THE ANGLE STRAIGHT DOWN TILT
H1mkGdf1ReM_10 0 BUT IF THEY ARE SPEARING STRAIGHT IN THIS ONE IS GOOD SO THEY SPEAR UP JUST BLOCK IT STRAIGHT UP THIS WAY AND FROM HERE YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT
H1mkGdf1ReM_11 0 SO ONCE AGAIN SPEAR IN BLOCK STRAIGHT UP
H1mkGdf1ReM_12 0 THAT'S THE OVER THE OVER THE HEAD BLOCK AND STAFF
GFfMVNhUO3E_1 0 HI THIS IS YOLANDA VANVEEN FROM VANVEENBULBS.COM
GFfMVNhUO3E_2 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO ATTRACT BLUEBIRDS TO YOUR GARDEN
GFfMVNhUO3E_3 0 NOW WE ALL LOVE WILDLIFE
GFfMVNhUO3E_4 0 THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT ANIMALS AND BIRDS THAT WE CAN ENJOY WHEN WE HAVE OUR GARDEN
GFfMVNhUO3E_5 0 WHETHER IT'S JUST SPENDING AN AFTERNOON LOOKING AT THE BUTTERFLIES
GFfMVNhUO3E_6 0 OR HUMMING BIRDS IN YOUR CROCOSMIA
GFfMVNhUO3E_7 0 THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT LITTLE BIRDS AND ANIMALS THAT WE REALLY ENJOY IN OUR GARDENS
GFfMVNhUO3E_8 0 AND THAT WE WANT TO ATTRACT
GFfMVNhUO3E_9 0 SO BLUEBIRDS ARE LIKE OTHER BIRDS
GFfMVNhUO3E_10 0 THERE'S JUST A FEW THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO SURVIVE
GFfMVNhUO3E_11 0 NOW YOU'VE GOT REMEMBER IN NATURE OUT IN THE WILD
GFfMVNhUO3E_12 0 YOU USUALLY FIND BLUEBIRDS IN WIDE OPEN FIELDS WITH JUST A FEW TREES
GFfMVNhUO3E_13 0 AND THERE'S LOTS OF FRUIT BERRIES
GFfMVNhUO3E_14 0 A LOT OF CHERRIES AND THOSE APPLES ALL KINDS OF TREES AND SHRUBS THAT THEY CAN LIVE IN
GFfMVNhUO3E_15 0 THEY ALSO NEED A LOT OF PLACES TO RAISE THEIR YOUNG
GFfMVNhUO3E_16 0 SO IN THE WILD THEY HAVE OLD TREES
GFfMVNhUO3E_17 0 WHEN TREES DIE THEY'RE HOLLOW
GFfMVNhUO3E_18 0 SO THEY MAKE THEIR HOMES INSIDE THE HOLLOW TREES
GFfMVNhUO3E_19 0 WELL IN OUR GARDENS WE DON'T USUALLY HAVE A LOT OF HOLLOW TREES
GFfMVNhUO3E_20 0 SO WE CAN ADD LIB A LITTLE BIT AND ENJOY THE BLUEBIRDS IN OUR GARDEN AS WELL
GFfMVNhUO3E_21 0 SO I MIGHT NOT HAVE A LOT OF DEAD LOGS ON MY PROPERTY
GFfMVNhUO3E_22 0 BUT I DO HAVE A LOT OF BIRD HOUSES
GFfMVNhUO3E_23 0 AND THE KEY WITH THE BLUEBIRDS IS IS YOU DON'T WANT THE HOLE TO THE ENTRANCE TO THE HOME
GFfMVNhUO3E_24 0 TO BE ANY LARGER THAN TWO INCHES
GFfMVNhUO3E_25 0 BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT LARGER BIRDS OR CROWS TO GET IN THERE AND ATTACK THE BABIES
GFfMVNhUO3E_26 0 OR GET THE EGGS OUT
GFfMVNhUO3E_27 0 AND JUST ABOUT TWO INCHES SEEMS TO BE THE KEY
GFfMVNhUO3E_28 0 AND BLUEBIRDS AND SPARROWS ALL LOVE BIRD HOUSES
GFfMVNhUO3E_29 0 AND SO I'VE GOT THEM ALL OVER MY PROPERTY
GFfMVNhUO3E_30 0 AND IT GIVES THEM A PLACE TO LIVE
GFfMVNhUO3E_31 0 AND WE DO HAVE A LOT OF WOLD AREAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
GFfMVNhUO3E_32 0 THAT THEY CAN LIVE AS WELL
GFfMVNhUO3E_33 0 SO THEY SEEM PRETTY HAPPY IN MY GARDEN
GFfMVNhUO3E_34 0 THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE OF YOUR GARDEN TO ATTRACT BIRDS
GFfMVNhUO3E_35 0 ANY TYPE OF BIRDS ESPECIALLY BLUEBIRDS IS WATER
GFfMVNhUO3E_36 0 YOU CANNOT HAVE BIRDS ON YOUR PROPERTY WITHOUT WATER
GFfMVNhUO3E_37 0 AND THE SPARROWS AND THE BLUEBIRDS AND THE BLUE JAYS JUST LOVE MY LITTLE ROCK WATER FOUNTAIN
GFfMVNhUO3E_38 0 AND EVEN THIS MORNING I SAW A LOT OF THEM PLAYING IN THERE
GFfMVNhUO3E_39 0 AND IT'S SO FUN TO SEE THEM
GFfMVNhUO3E_40 0 AND HOW MUCH FUN THEY HAVE IN THE WATER
GFfMVNhUO3E_41 0 AND SO MAKE SURE IF YOU HAVE ANY WATER FEATURES
GFfMVNhUO3E_42 0 NEVER EVER TO ADD ANY CHEMICALS
GFfMVNhUO3E_43 0 NO BLEACH NO ALGAE REDUCERS
GFfMVNhUO3E_44 0 PRETTY MUCH NOTHING
GFfMVNhUO3E_45 0 MY KEY IS TO MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT PUT THEM IN FULL HOT SUN
GFfMVNhUO3E_46 0 SO THEY DON'T GET AS MUCH ALGAE
GFfMVNhUO3E_47 0 AND ALSO I JUST DRAIN ALL THE WATER OUT AND PUT FRESH NEW WATER IN IT
GFfMVNhUO3E_48 0 JUST BY ADDING THE HOSE TO IT FOR ABOUT AN HOUR ONCE A WEEK
GFfMVNhUO3E_49 0 AND THAT'S ABOUT ENOUGH TO KEEP THE WATER FRESH FOR THE BIRDS
GFfMVNhUO3E_50 0 BLUEBIRDS ALSO NEED SOME KIND OF A FOOD SOURCE
GFfMVNhUO3E_51 0 AND THEY LOVE SUNFLOWERS AND THEY LOVE ALL TYPES OF BERRIES
GFfMVNhUO3E_52 0 BLUE BERRIES AND BLACK BERRIES AND RASPBERRIES AND CHERRIES
GFfMVNhUO3E_53 0 AND SO IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT FRUIT TREES ON YOUR PROPERTY OR EVEN WILD BERRIES
GFfMVNhUO3E_54 0 OR ANY WILD AREAS NEAR YOU THEY'LL BE REALLY HAPPY
GFfMVNhUO3E_55 0 AND I REALLY ENJOY ALL OF THE BLUEBIRDS ON MY PROPERTY
GFfMVNhUO3E_56 0 AND JUST BY ADDING SOME BIRD HOUSES
GFfMVNhUO3E_57 0 MAKING SURE YOU HAVE SOME BERRIES AND A COUPLE WATER FEATURES
GFfMVNhUO3E_58 0 YOU'LL BE AMAZED HOW THE BIRDS WILL ENJOY YOUR PROPERTY TOO

GGh8knFY2rw_1 0 FOR ANOTHER EDGED WEAPON ATTACK OR DEFENSE FROM A STRAIGHT STAB WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE INSIDE NOW
GGh8knFY2rw_2 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT ANOTHER DISARM
GGh8knFY2rw_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO USE THE SAME PRINCIPLE
GGh8knFY2rw_4 0 OFF LINE AS ALWAYS
GGh8knFY2rw_5 0 THIS TIME I'M GOING TO ATTACK THE INSIDE OF THE FOREARM
GGh8knFY2rw_6 0 IT'S WHERE I NATURALLY AM
GGh8knFY2rw_7 0 AND I'M ALSO GOING TO ATTACK THE WRIST AS WELL
GGh8knFY2rw_8 0 IT'LL BE SIMULTANEOUS
GGh8knFY2rw_9 0 OBVIOUSLY IT'S PRETTY PHYSICALLY COMPLICATED TO A DEGREE
GGh8knFY2rw_10 0 BUT I WANT TO KEEP THE MOTIONS NICE SHORT AND SWEET AND TO THE POINT
GGh8knFY2rw_11 0 MY GOAL IS TO STRIKE THIS HERE
GGh8knFY2rw_12 0 CAUSE STRETCHING OF THE TISSUE AND THEN CUT DOWN TO THE WRIST AND AS I DO THAT I'LL BEGIN TO GET A NICE BEND IN THE WRIST
GGh8knFY2rw_13 0 SO AS DANIEL COMES IN
GGh8knFY2rw_15 0 START TO STRETCH IT OUT
GGh8knFY2rw_16 0 HOLD ON TO IT
GGh8knFY2rw_17 0 WE'LL DO IT NICE AND SLOW
GGh8knFY2rw_18 0 HERE JUST LIKE THIS
GGh8knFY2rw_19 0 NOW AS HE COMES IN
GGh8knFY2rw_20 0 BY STRIKING HERE I STRETCH THE HAND OUT
GGh8knFY2rw_21 0 HE'LL STILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTROL HERE AND BY STRIKING INTO THE WRIST I GET A NATURAL FLEXATION OF THE WRIST WHICH CAUSES THE FINGERS TO STRETCH OUT WHICH ALLOWS THE KNIFE TO FLY AWAY
GGh8knFY2rw_22 0 SO ONCE AGAIN AS DANIEL COMES IN I'M STRIKING INTO THE FOREARM DOWN INTO THE ARM DOWN INTO THE WRIST HAND COMES UP THE KNIFE COMES OUT
GGh8knFY2rw_23 0 AND THAT'S A NICE INSIDE PARRYING STRIKING TECHNIQUE FOR A STRAIGHT STAB
hCvNibEfOOM_1 0 HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON
hCvNibEfOOM_2 0 AND WHAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT A SMALL FORWARD IS AND A POWER FORWARD IS
hCvNibEfOOM_3 0 THE FORWARD POSITION IS USUALLY A LITTLE BIT BIGGER OF A PLAYER THAN WHAT WE USE FOR OUR GUARDS
hCvNibEfOOM_4 0 OUR POINT GUARDS ARE TYPICALLY ONE OF THE SMALLER GUYS IN THE OFFENSE AND OUR SHOOTING GUARDS ARE USUALLY A LITTLE BIT BIGGER
hCvNibEfOOM_5 0 BUT OUR FORWARDS ARE GOING TO BE THE BIG GUYS YOU WANT TO CONCENTRATE ON THE SMALL FORWARD BEING A BIG GUARD THAT CAN SHOOT
hCvNibEfOOM_6 0 SO FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE GOT KYLE HERE WHO IS A TALLER PLAYER HE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN OUR POST PLAYERS BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE'S A GOOD OUTSIDE SHOOTER
hCvNibEfOOM_7 0 SO WE CAN USE HIM OUT ON THE WING AS AN OUTSIDE SHOOTER WHAT WE CALL THE SMALL FORWARD POSITION WHICH IS ACTUALLY LIKE ANOTHER BIG GUARD
hCvNibEfOOM_8 0 SOME OFFENSES RUN A THREE GUARD SET SO INSTEAD OF HAVING A SMALL FORWARD THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER GUARD
hCvNibEfOOM_9 0 SO OUR POWER FORWARD SPOT THEN IS BASICALLY IF YOU'RE TEAM IS BLESSED LIKE OURS IS WE HAVE A LOT OF BIG POST PLAYERS SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE TWO PLAYERS THAT MIGHT BE CENTERS ONE AS A POWER FORWARD AND ONE AS A CENTER
hCvNibEfOOM_10 0 BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO ARE A POWER FORWARD IS GOING TO BE A GUY THAT CAN POST UP BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE CAN SHOOT FROM THE OUTSIDE AS WELL
hCvNibEfOOM_11 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO USE HIM AS A VERSATILE ROLE WHERE A CENTER IS MORE OF A GUY THAT'S JUST GOING TO PLAY UNDERNEATH AND HE'S GOING TO POST UP AND HE'S GOING TO REBOUND UNDERNEATH
hCvNibEfOOM_12 0 BUT THIS GUY'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE MORE VERSATILE
hCvNibEfOOM_13 0 WE'RE GOING TO RUN HIM FROM SIDE TO SIDE WE'RE GOING TO RUN HIM OFF SOME SCREENS ALLOW HIM TO COME UP IN THE HIGH POST AREA AND SHOOT AS WELL
hCvNibEfOOM_14 0 SO WE'VE GOT OUR POWER FORWARD WHICH PLAYS DOWN LOW MOST OF THE TIME AND OUR SMALL FORWARDS WHICH ARE GOING TO PLAY OUT ON THE PERIMETER FOR US
hCvNibEfOOM_15 0 AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO FORWARD ROLES
hd0oFipSBOc_1 0 YOU'VE MADE A GREAT DECISION YOU'RE GOING TO INTERVIEW SOMEONE FOR A PAPER OR A SPEECH OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE YOU NEED RESEARCH MATERIAL FOR
hd0oFipSBOc_2 0 WELL THE FIRST THING THAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS SAY WHO AM I GOING TO INTERVIEW
hd0oFipSBOc_3 0 WELL PICK AN EXPERT AND WHAT IS AN EXPERT
hd0oFipSBOc_4 0 WELL IT'S SOMEONE WHO IS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THE SPECIFIC FIELD THAT THEY ARE IN BUT AN EXPERT CAN BE SOMETHING ELSE AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT IN JUST A SECOND
hd0oFipSBOc_5 0 WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT EXPERTS KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THEIR FIELD A MILLION THINGS COME TO MY MIND
hd0oFipSBOc_6 0 FIRST OF ALL I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THE MOST UNTAPPED SOURCE OF EXPERTS ON THE PLANET
hd0oFipSBOc_7 0 DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS FACULTY MEMBERS AT COLLEGES FACULTY MEMBERS HAVE GONE TO SCHOOL FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS
hd0oFipSBOc_8 0 MANY OF THEM HAVE PHD'S
hd0oFipSBOc_9 0 THEY'VE WRITTEN BOOKS
hd0oFipSBOc_10 0 THEY'VE WRITTEN JOURNAL ARTICLES
hd0oFipSBOc_11 0 THEY ARE AN EXCELLENT SOURCE OF AN EXPERT SO IF YOU HAVE ANY CONNECTIONS TO A COLLEGE OR A UNIVERSITY YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT USING A FACULTY MEMBER FOR YOUR EXPERT TO INTERVIEW BUT EXPERTS COULD BE POLITICIANS LAW MAKERS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS MEDICAL PERSONNEL THEY ARE EXPERTS AT WHAT THEY DO RESEARCHERS RELIGIOUS LEADERS COMMUNITY LEADERS THOSE ARE YOUR TOP CHOICES FOR EXPERTS FOR MANY MANY SUBJECTS BUT IN A MINUTE I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE NOT SO OBVIOUS EXPERT
gIXVjBpc0u8_1 0 HI MY NAME IS LINCOLN WARD
gIXVjBpc0u8_2 0 I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE AUSTIN TENNIS CENTER AS WELL AS A USPTA CERTIFIED TEACHING PRO HERE IN AUSTIN TEXAS
gIXVjBpc0u8_3 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE EQUIPMENT YOU NEED FOR TENNIS
gIXVjBpc0u8_4 0 THE FIRST THING YOU'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO NEED IS A TENNIS RACKET WITH STRINGS
gIXVjBpc0u8_5 0 A TENNIS RACKET IS GOING TO GO ALONG WITH YOUR TENNIS BALL SO YOU CAN HIT THE BALL BACK AND FORTH
gIXVjBpc0u8_6 0 NOW THE REST OF THE THINGS YOU NEED ARE NOT QUITE AS ESSENTIAL AS YOUR TENNIS BALL AND YOUR TENNIS RACKET
gIXVjBpc0u8_7 0 YOU COULD DEFINITELY USE A TENNIS COURT WHICH WILL DEFINITELY HELP YOUR GAME BUT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED THAT
gIXVjBpc0u8_8 0 YOU CAN ALWAYS PLAY TENNIS ON THE SIDE OF A WALL OR A BACKBOARD SO A TENNIS COURT IS DEFINITELY OPTIONAL WHEN IT'S COMING TO PLAYING TENNIS
gIXVjBpc0u8_9 0 NOW THERE'S NO DEFINITE CRITERIA FOR WHAT KIND OF CLOTHING YOU NEED TO WEAR
gIXVjBpc0u8_10 0 BACK BEFORE 1975 MOST OF THE TOURNAMENTS REQUIRED YOU TO WEAR WHITE SHORTS OR WHITE SHIRTS BUT THAT'S NO LONGER THE CASE
gIXVjBpc0u8_11 0 NOW THE TENNIS SHOES THE SHOES YOU USE IS QUITE IMPORTANT ACTUALLY
gIXVjBpc0u8_12 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO WEAR OPEN TOED SHOES WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING TENNIS BECAUSE OF ALL THE CHANGING DIRECTION RUNNING AND STOPPING YOU NEED
gIXVjBpc0u8_13 0 THERE ARE SPECIFIC TENNIS SHOES THAT YOU WANT TO USE AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH YOU CAN GO BETWEEN CROSS-TRAINERS OR TENNIS SPECIFIC SHOES OR EVEN SOME BASKETBALL SHOES
gIXVjBpc0u8_14 0 YOU REALLY WANT TO LOOK FOR A SHOE THAT DOES NOT HAVE A BLACK SOLE
gIXVjBpc0u8_15 0 THE SOLES ON THE SHOES CAN LEAVE SCUFFS ON A TENNIS COURT WHICH TEND TO RUIN THE COURT A LITTLE BIT FASTER
gIXVjBpc0u8_16 0 ALSO ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR TENNIS SHOE THERE ARE PATTERNS THAT TENNIS SHOES GENERALLY HAVE
gIXVjBpc0u8_17 0 THEY ARE THERE'S A LOT MORE GAPS IN BETWEEN THE SHOES WHICH CREATES MORE SURFACE AREA BETWEEN THE RUBBER AND THE SHOE
gIXVjBpc0u8_18 0 CROSS-TRAINERS GENERALLY WORK AS WELL AS BASKETBALL SHOES
gIXVjBpc0u8_19 0 THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE EQUIPMENT YOU NEED IN TENNIS
h5Tc0QPiB_o_1 0 HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
h5Tc0QPiB_o_2 0 WE'RE WORKING HERE WITH OUR RUNNING BACKS IN THE PROPER WAY TO TAKE A HAND OFF
h5Tc0QPiB_o_3 0 YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE HAND OFF IN THE PROPER WAY FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS
h5Tc0QPiB_o_4 0 ONE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE RIGHT WAY TO WRAP UP THE BALL IF YOU TAKE THE HAND OFF IN THE WRONG WAY
h5Tc0QPiB_o_5 0 THE SECOND WAY IS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER FOR THE QUARTERBACK TO GIVE YOU THE BALL IF YOU'RE NOT OPENED UP THE PROPER WAY
h5Tc0QPiB_o_6 0 IF YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS REVERSED AND HE'S TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE HAND OFF ON THE WRONG SIDE AND YOU HAVE YOUR ELBOW OUT THERE CHANCES ARE YOU'RE GOING TO HIT WITH YOUR ARM AND YOU'RE GOING TO KNOCK THE BALL LOOSE FROM THE QUARTERBACK
h5Tc0QPiB_o_7 0 SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN A RUNNING BACK COMES THROUGH HE WANTS TO BE LOW HE WANTS TO BE OPEN AND READY WITH HIS INSIDE HAND TO THE QUARTERBACK
h5Tc0QPiB_o_8 0 HIS INSIDE ARM HAS TO BE OPEN NOT DOWN
h5Tc0QPiB_o_9 0 IT HAS TO BE OPEN SO THE QUARTERBACK CAN SLIDE THE BALL IN
h5Tc0QPiB_o_10 0 ONCE THE BALL GOES INSIDE HE WANTS TO WRAP THE BALL UP TIGHT AND COVER IT WITH BOTH TIPS OVER THE BALL
h5Tc0QPiB_o_11 0 IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE THIS VIDEO DEMO
h5Tc0QPiB_o_12 0 RUNNING BACK IS GOING TO OPEN UP HE'S TAKING IT LOW YOU SEE HE'S COVERING UP BOTH TIPS AND HE'S STILL STAYING LOW AND STAYING FORWARD AS HE COMES THROUGH
h5Tc0QPiB_o_13 0 SO REMEMBER WHEN TAKING A HAND OFF DON'T TAKE THE HAND OFF WITH YOUR HANDS DOWN LOW
h5Tc0QPiB_o_14 0 YOU'RE GOING TO OPEN UP THE INSIDE ARM IS OPEN THE BALL'S GOING TO GO IN YOU'RE GOING TO COVER THE BALL WITH BOTH TIPS AND HOLD ON TO IT TIGHT STAYING LOW IN ORDER TO EXPLODE THROUGH THE HOLE
GiSAtoR1mvM_1 0 NEXT TRICK WE ARE GOING TO BE DOING IS A TRICK CALLED SEASICK
GiSAtoR1mvM_2 0 LOOKS JUST LIKE IT SOUNDS
GiSAtoR1mvM_3 0 MAKES YOU SEASICK
GiSAtoR1mvM_4 0 IT'S CRAZY LOOKING IT'S REALLY COOL
GiSAtoR1mvM_5 0 LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FIRST AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH IT
GiSAtoR1mvM_6 0 SEASICK LOOKS LIKE THIS
GiSAtoR1mvM_7 0 IT COMES UP FROM A SPLIT BOTTOM MOUNT AND THEN WHAT YOU DO IS COME BACK
GiSAtoR1mvM_8 0 THE YO-YO SHOOTS UP INTO THE AIR AND BACK DOWN AGAIN
GiSAtoR1mvM_9 0 I'M GOING TO DO A COUPLE ROLLS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR MYSELF
GiSAtoR1mvM_10 0 AND THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
GiSAtoR1mvM_11 0 THAT'S THE TRICK CALLED SEASICK
GiSAtoR1mvM_12 0 YOU NOTICE THE YO-YO IS JUST BOUNCING UP AND DOWN BETWEEN TWO STRINGS
GiSAtoR1mvM_13 0 IT'S LIKE A CRAZY BOING BOING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
GiSAtoR1mvM_14 0 BUT IT'S A REALLY IMPRESSIVE TRICK
GiSAtoR1mvM_15 0 PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO THINK WHEN THEY SEE THAT
GiSAtoR1mvM_16 0 SO THAT'S SEASICK
GiSAtoR1mvM_17 0 LET ME SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE
GiSAtoR1mvM_18 0 WHAT YOU DO IS YOU START FROM A SPLIT BOTTOM MOUNT AND INSTEAD OF GOING FORWARD YOU ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO GO BACKWARDS
GiSAtoR1mvM_19 0 YOU GO BACKWARDS ON TO THE STRING THAT'S CONNECTED BETWEEN YOUR THROW HAND MIDDLE FINGER AND YOUR POINTER FINGER SO IT COMES BACK LIKE THAT
GiSAtoR1mvM_20 0 AND FROM HERE WHAT YOU DO IS YOU KEEP GOING BACK LIKE SO INTO THAT NEXT STRING AND AS YOU DO SO YOU SHOOT IT UP
GiSAtoR1mvM_21 0 IT'S KIND OF A WEIRD MOTION
GiSAtoR1mvM_22 0 LET ME SHOW FROM THIS ANGLE
GiSAtoR1mvM_23 0 AS IT COMES BACK YOU BRING IT BACK HERE AND YOU SHOOT IT UP INTO THE STRING SO LIKE THAT
GiSAtoR1mvM_24 0 IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT
GiSAtoR1mvM_25 0 YOU CAN SEE THE BEGINNING OF IT STARTING TO FORM
GiSAtoR1mvM_26 0 LET ME SHOW AGAIN
GiSAtoR1mvM_27 0 IT'S SHOOTING UP LIKE THAT SO IT COMES BACK AND YOU SHOOT IT UP
GiSAtoR1mvM_28 0 TAKE A LOOK AT THIS VIDEO SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT TO SEE WHAT I'M DOING
GiSAtoR1mvM_29 0 REALLY PRACTICE SHOOTING IT UP LIKE THAT
GiSAtoR1mvM_30 0 NOW WHEN IT COMES BACK DOWN IT'S GOING TO FALL ONTO THAT BOTTOM STRING AND THAT'S RIGHT WHERE YOU STARTED FROM AGAIN
GiSAtoR1mvM_31 0 SO YOU JUST GO BACKWARDS SHOOT IT UP AND IT COMES BACK DOWN TO THAT STRING
GiSAtoR1mvM_32 0 SO JUST LIKE THIS
GiSAtoR1mvM_33 0 WHEN YOU FIRST START YOUR MOTIONS MIGHT BE MORE LIKE THAT LIKE IT MIGHT JUST BE GOING UP AND DOWN WHICH IS FINE
GiSAtoR1mvM_34 0 THE MORE YOU PRACTICE THE MORE YOU'RE GOING TO GET ROOM FOR THE YO-YO TO MOVE IN AND THE MORE ADVANCED YOUR SEASICK WILL GET
GiSAtoR1mvM_35 0 TRY THIS ONE MORE TIME
GiSAtoR1mvM_36 0 UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN YOU'RE CONTROLLING IT
GiSAtoR1mvM_37 0 AS IT HITS THAT STRING YOU KIND OF COME BACK IT'S KIND OF LIKE A STALLING ACTION AS IT'S COMING DOWN YOU KIND OF LET IF FALL BACK DOWN
GiSAtoR1mvM_38 0 IT'S A LITTLE BIT TRICKY
GiSAtoR1mvM_39 0 IT'S ONE OF THOSE TRICKS THAT JUST REQUIRES LOTS OF PRACTICE
GiSAtoR1mvM_40 0 WATCH THE VIDEO LIKE I SAID
GiSAtoR1mvM_41 0 WATCH IS THOROUGHLY
GiSAtoR1mvM_42 0 AND GOOD LUCK
gRjrl0hi1_A_1 0 JOHN SEXTON HI I'M JOHN SEXTON ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gRjrl0hi1_A_2 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE LEARNING HOW TO PLAY PORTAL A GAME BY VALVE SOFTWARE A COMPANY WITH WHICH I HAVE NO AFFILIATION
gRjrl0hi1_A_3 0 SO THIS WAS A VERY DIFFICULT PUZZLE NOT CONCEPTUALLY BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO EXECUTE
gRjrl0hi1_A_4 0 SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD A PORTAL THAT WENT DOWN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CHASM THAT YOU CAN'T SEE RIGHT HERE IN THE ENTRANCE HERE AND WE JUMPED IN THE CHASM AND CAME OUT OF HERE WHICH LAUNCHED US HIGH ENOUGH IN THE AIR TO BE ABLE TO SHOOT A PORTAL DOWN ON THIS PLATFORM
gRjrl0hi1_A_5 0 THEN WHEN WE FELL BACK INTO THIS ONE WE CAME OUT OF THIS ONE
gRjrl0hi1_A_6 0 AND WE SHOT ANOTHER PORTAL ONTO HERE AND THEN WE WENT BACK INTO THIS PORTAL AND POPPED OUT OF THIS ONE
gRjrl0hi1_A_7 0 DID THE SAME THING FROM HERE TO HERE AND THEN WE DID THE SAME THING FROM HERE TO HERE AND THAT LAUNCHED US ACROSS TO THIS SAFE SPACE
gRjrl0hi1_A_8 0 THANKFULLY WE'RE DONE WITH THAT VERY DISORIENTING PUZZLE AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF THIS TEST CHAMBER
GO0V4ZGSF28_1 0 ALL RIGHT I'M STILL TALKING ABOUT SPONTANEITY BUT WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT NOW IS YOUR AUDIENCE AND YOUR AUDIENCE'S PERCEPTION OF WHETHER YOU ARE BEING SPONTANEOUS OR NOT
GO0V4ZGSF28_2 0 MEANING ARE YOU BEING CONVERSATIONAL OR NOT
GO0V4ZGSF28_3 0 IF YOU TEND TO RECITE YOUR SPEECH BY ROTE AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS YOU'VE PRACTICED IT SO MUCH YOU'VE SAID IN THE SHOWER IN THE CAR IN YOUR SLEEP TO YOUR FRIENDS TO YOUR MOM TO EVERYBODY YOU KNOW AND SO YOU'RE JUST SPITTING IT OUT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT SO WELL THE AUDIENCE IS GOING TO BE AWARE OF THAT
GO0V4ZGSF28_4 0 WHAT IT'S GOING TO COME ACROSS LIKE IS THAT YOU HAVE MEMORIZED YOUR SPEECH
GO0V4ZGSF28_5 0 AND WHEN YOU'VE MEMORIZED YOUR SPEECH YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT WORDS COME NEXT
GO0V4ZGSF28_6 0 I'M PULLING UP THE MEMORIZED LINES I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT WHAT I'M SAYING
GO0V4ZGSF28_7 0 ACTORS CAN DO THAT PUBLIC SPEAKERS CANNOT
GBPkov2tE1k_1 0 HI MY NAME IS RICK VAN HOORN AND HERE TO TALK ABOUT MOUNTAIN BIKING FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
GBPkov2tE1k_2 0 OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HORSES ON THE TRAIL
GBPkov2tE1k_3 0 ALRIGHT IN ALL SERIOUS AS THOUGH I'VE SEEN SOME PRETTY TERRIBLE ENCOUNTERS WITH MOUNTAIN BIKE RIDERS AND HORSES OR EQUESTRIANS AND IT JUST CREATES FOR BAD BLOOD BETWEEN BOTH USER GROUPS
GBPkov2tE1k_4 0 WHENEVER YOU COME ACROSS A HORSE ON A TRAIL YOU NEED TO STOP AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN
GBPkov2tE1k_5 0 THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS IN CONTROL OF YOUR SPEED
GBPkov2tE1k_6 0 YOU STOP AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND STEP OFF OF YOUR BIKE AND YOU STAND IN BETWEEN YOUR BIKE AND THE HORSE AS THE HORSE IS PASSING
GBPkov2tE1k_7 0 BEFORE YOU EVEN DO THAT THOUGH YOU MIGHT EVEN JUST WANT TO ASK THE EQUESTRIAN RIDER WHAT WOULD YOU WANT ME TO DO
GBPkov2tE1k_8 0 WHERE WOULD YOU WANT ME TO BE
GBPkov2tE1k_9 0 IT JUST PUTS THEM IN CONTROL AND SETTLES THEM DOWN IF THEY'RE UPSET WITH YOU
GBPkov2tE1k_10 0 REMEMBER THEY ARE THE ONES THAT CAN GET INJURED THEY FALL A LONG WAY OFF THAT HORSE WE ARE JUST FALLING OFF OUR BIKE IF THAT HAPPENS
GBPkov2tE1k_11 0 REMEMBER WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE TRAILS ARE OPENED TO EVERYBODY
GwXNlblxiFY_1 0 THERE'S SOME OTHER EARLY ELECTRIC CLOCKS WHICH MORE AND MORE NOW PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO APPRECIATE ESPECIALLY SINCE PLUG IN CLOCKS PRETTY MUCH ARE A THING OF THE PAST NOW WITH BATTERY CLOCKS TAKING THEIR PLACE
GwXNlblxiFY_2 0 TELECHRON IS REALLY THE COMPANY THAT PERFECTED PLUG IN CLOCKS
GwXNlblxiFY_3 0 BEFORE THAT YOU HAD THE PROBLEM WITH POWER INTERRUPTIONS
GwXNlblxiFY_4 0 YOUR CLOCK WOULDN'T RESTART OR IT WOULD START AGAIN AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE'D BEEN A POWER INTERRUPTION AND IT WOULD BE SAYING THE WRONG TIME
GwXNlblxiFY_5 0 THE WARREN TELECHRON COMPANY COORDINATED WITH THE POWER COMPANIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE GETTING A SIXTY CYCLE POWER
GwXNlblxiFY_6 0 AND AS LONG AS SIXTY CYCLE POWER CAME THROUGH THE LINES YOUR CLOCK WAS GOING TO BE ACCURATE BECAUSE IT WAS GEARED TO TURN TO CONVERT THAT SIXTY CYCLE POWER INTO ACCURATE TIME KEEPING IN AN ELECTRIC CLOCK
GwXNlblxiFY_7 0 THERE'S EARLY ONES IN BEAUTIFUL WOODEN CASES
GwXNlblxiFY_8 0 SO THEY'RE ATTRACTIVE TO LOOK AT
GwXNlblxiFY_9 0 OFTEN IF YOU'RE UNSURE ABOUT WHETHER THE TELECHRON ELECTRIC MOTOR IN THERE IS ANY GOOD OR IF IT HAS STOPPED WORKING THESE CAN BE CONVERTED TO BATTERY
GwXNlblxiFY_10 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE CHORD BUT YOU CAN STILL ENJOY THE AESTHETICS OF THEM
GwXNlblxiFY_11 0 WE HAVE AGAIN A BOOK BY JIM LINDS ON THESE TELECHRON CLOCKS
GwXNlblxiFY_12 0 TELECHRON LATER BECAME PART OF GE BUT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF STYLES AND HE'S ASSIGNED CONTEMPORARY COLLECTING BAGGAGE TO THEM AS WELL
GwXNlblxiFY_13 0 SO THIS GIVES YOU A GUIDE AT LEAST OF WHICH ONES ARE RARE AND WHICH ONES ARE MORE COMMON
GwXNlblxiFY_14 0 THE FINAL THING TO NOTE AND SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER IN THE PAST TOO THAT THESE TELECHRON CLOCKS ALWAYS HAD A LITTLE PORTHOLE IN THE DIAL WHICH WOULD SHOW RED IF THE POWER HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
GwXNlblxiFY_15 0 THE CLOCK WOULD RESTART BUT AT LEAST YOU KNOW THAT THE POWER WAS OFF FOR A MINUTE OR FIVE HOURS AND YOU WOULD NO LONGER TRUST THE TIME THAT THE CLOCK SHOWS
GwXNlblxiFY_16 0 AS SOON AS YOU RESET THE CLOCK THAT RED DOT GOES AWAY UNTIL THE NEXT TIME THE POWER GOES OFF
gFuQt0wjlTk_1 0 CHRISTINA HAGGERTY HI
gFuQt0wjlTk_2 0 I'M CHRISTINA HAGGERTY AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M TEACHING CHA-CHA-CHA LA STYLE BREAKING ON TWO

gFuQt0wjlTk_4 0 THIS STEP THAT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU NOW IS THE RIGHT TURN
gFuQt0wjlTk_5 0 SO AGAIN WE'RE USING THE ONE TO FIND THE TWO
gFuQt0wjlTk_6 0 WE'RE GOING ONE COMING INTO OUR BASIC TWO THREE CHA-CHA-CHA BACK BREAK
gFuQt0wjlTk_7 0 HERE COMES THE RIGHT TURN
gFuQt0wjlTk_8 0 WE USE A PIVOT
gFuQt0wjlTk_9 0 STEP FORWARD ON THE LEFT
gFuQt0wjlTk_10 0 NOW WITH THE PIVOT YOU LIFT YOUR HEELS AND YOU STAY ON YOUR TOES AND YOU SWITCH 90-DEGREE DIRECTIONS
gFuQt0wjlTk_11 0 SO AGAIN YOU STEP PIVOT AS YOU PIVOT THE WEIGHT IS GOING TO COME TO THE RIGHT AND THEN YOU USE YOUR CHA-CHA-CHA TO COMPLETE THE TURN
gFuQt0wjlTk_12 0 SO AGAIN OUT OF OUR BASIC GOES ONE TWO THREE CHA-CHA-CHA BACK BREAK CHA-CHA
gFuQt0wjlTk_13 0 HERE'S THE TURN
gFuQt0wjlTk_14 0 STEP LEFT PIVOT
gFuQt0wjlTk_16 0 CHA-CHA-CHA BACK STEP CHA-CHA-CHA THAT'S THE FULL RIGHT TURN
gFuQt0wjlTk_17 0 LET'S TRY SLOWLY AGAIN WEIGHT SHIFT ONE
gFuQt0wjlTk_18 0 HERE'S OUR BASIC THREE CHA-CHA-CHA

gFuQt0wjlTk_20 0 HERE COMES THE TURN STEP FORWARD PIVOT STEP CHA-CHA-CHA FINISH YOUR BASIC CHA-CHA-CHA
GxtKmph_y4s_1 0 HI I'M TIM GIPSON AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO FIX UP AN OLD WOOD CHAIR
GxtKmph_y4s_2 0 NOW IF YOU COULD GO OUT AND YARD SALES YOU CAN FIND WHAT WE CALL SOME DIAMONDS IN THE ROUGH AND THIS PARTICULAR CASE THIS IS A PERIOD PIECE THAT IS A WIDE BODY ROCKER AND THESE ARE REALLY HARD TO COME BY YOU DON'T SEE A WHOLE OF THESE OUT THERE THEY ARE VERY RARE
GxtKmph_y4s_3 0 THIS IS REALLY GOOD CONSTRUCTION JUST HAS A FEW THINGS THAT IT NEEDS DONE TO REALLY BRING SOME LIFE BACK TO THIS ROCKET
GxtKmph_y4s_4 0 SO YOU CAN SEE WE'RE MISSING THE BOTTOM AND WE'RE MISSING THE BACK BUT WITH THIS PIECE ONCE WE REFINISH THE FOOD IT'S VERY EASY TO COME BACK AND CUT SOME BACK PIECES AND THEN COVER THOSE WITH SOME KIND OF A FABRIC AND SOME PADDING TO CREATE A NEW BASE
GxtKmph_y4s_5 0 BUT FIRST THERE WOULD BE SOME THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO TO FIX THIS
GxtKmph_y4s_6 0 AS YOU CAN SEE ON THIS PARTICULAR ROCKER SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU HAVE WITH A LOT OF OLD PIECES OF FURNITURE THAT YOU MAY PICK UP TO FIX IS THAT YOU'LL HAVE BROKEN PARTS OR BROKEN LEGS
GxtKmph_y4s_7 0 NOW IN THIS CASE IT'S JUST THE ROCKERS
GxtKmph_y4s_8 0 SO WHAT WE WOULD DO IS THAT WE WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE A MALLET AND VERY GENTLY BANGING AWAY AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN EVEN TAKE YOUR HAND AND BANG AWAY
GxtKmph_y4s_9 0 BUT WE WOULD TAKE A MALLET AND WE WANT TO SEPARATE THESE AT THESE TENDON JOINTS RIGHT HERE AND IT'S SIMPLY JUST GOT A ROUND POST THAT IS HOLDING THESE ROCKERS ON
GxtKmph_y4s_10 0 NOW ONCE WE REMOVE BOTH OF THEM THE REASON WE WANT TO REMOVE BOTH OF THEM BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO REMOVE THE DAMAGED ONE BUT THEN WE ALSO WANT TO GET THIS GOOD ONE OFF
GxtKmph_y4s_11 0 BECAUSE THEN WHAT WE WILL DO IS WE'LL ACTUALLY FABRICATE TWO NEW ROCKERS AND WE'LL USE THIS GOOD PIECE AS A TEMPLATE
GxtKmph_y4s_12 0 WE'LL TRACE IT OUT ON A PIECE OF WOOD AND WE'LL CUT TWO OF THOSE OUT AND SAND THOSE AND FINISH THOSE IDENTICALLY TO COME BACK AND PUT BACK ON OUR ROCKER
GxtKmph_y4s_13 0 NOW WE GOT SEVERAL CHOICES THE FINISH THIS ACTUALLY HAS A PRETTY GOOD FINISH BUT IT NEEDS TO BE FRESHENED UP AND WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST THING TO DO SINCE THE VARNISH ON THIS IS REALLY AGED WOULD BE TO USE A STRIPPER ON THIS ENTIRE PIECE
GxtKmph_y4s_14 0 AND WHAT THAT WILL DO IS IT WILL BREAK DOWN A LOT OF THE SURFACE VARNISH AND ACTUALLY FRESHEN UP AND TAKE OFF SOME OF THE AGED STAIN THAT IS ALSO ON THIS AS WELL SO THAT WE CAN REVEAL A LOT OF THE WOOD GRAIN
GxtKmph_y4s_15 0 AND THEN WE CAN COME BACK AND JUST FRESHEN IT UP WITH A COAT OR TWO OF URETHANE OR A VARNISH OR A SHELLAC DEPENDING ON WHAT WE WANT TO DO AND DEPENDING ON THE KIND OF LOOK WE WANT TOO
GxtKmph_y4s_16 0 SO I'M TIM GIPSON AND THAT'S HOW TO REPAIR AN OLD PIECE OF FURNITURE
hFiINQH0R1g_1 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO ADD TUBES OF WAX WHICH WE CALL GATING
hFiINQH0R1g_2 0 AND THEN AFTER THIS WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE THE WHOLE WAX THING WITH THE GATING ON IT AND WE'RE GOING TO START DIPPING IT INTO A VAT A SLURRY
hFiINQH0R1g_3 0 AND YOU TAKE IT OUT OF THE SLURRY AND YOU DIP IT IN THE SILICA THEN YOU TAKE IT OUT OF THE SILICA AND YOU HANG IT UP
hFiINQH0R1g_4 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS FOR A FULL WEEK BECAUSE WE WANT TO CREATE AN OUTER SHELL AN OUTER SHELL TO THIS WAX SCULPTURE
hFiINQH0R1g_5 0 WHICH WILL ALMOST BE LIKE A PIECE OF CHINA
hFiINQH0R1g_6 0 THEN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS AFTER THAT'S COMPLETED WE TAKE IT AND WE PUT IT IN THIS HUGE OVEN HERE
hFiINQH0R1g_7 0 AND WE MELT THE WAX OUT AND AFTER THE WAX IS MELTED OUT THE NEXT PROCESS IS WE'RE GOING TO POUR THE BRONZE IN BECAUSE WE HAVE AN EMPTY SHELL NOW
hFiINQH0R1g_8 0 SO WE'RE GOING THROUGH QUITE A FEW DIFFERENT PROCESSES HERE
hFiINQH0R1g_9 0 WE HAVE THE ORIGINAL CLAY WE MAKE THE MOLD OF THE CLAY THEN WE HAVE THE WAX AND NOW THE WAX LOOKS LIKE THE ORIGINAL CLAY THEN WE MAKE ANOTHER MOLD OF IT OUT OF THE SILICA AND AFTER THAT THE WAX COMES OUT AND THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER MOLD THAT WE POUR THE BRONZE INTO AND THEN WE TURN THAT UPSIDE DOWN AFTER THE BRONZE GETS IN THERE
hFiINQH0R1g_10 0 AND THEN WE START BREAKING THE SILICA OFF WHICH IS VERY BRITTLE AT THIS POINT WITH SLEDGE HAMMERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT TO EXPOSE THE BRONZE
H1Y2xouTdjA_1 0 THE CAKES ARE IN THE OVEN AND NOW IT'S TIME TO START THE ICING
H1Y2xouTdjA_2 0 NOW THE ICING IS NO JOKE
H1Y2xouTdjA_3 0 IT'S A SERIOUS CREAM CHEESE ICING
H1Y2xouTdjA_4 0 AND WE HAVE ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS THAT WE NEED HERE
H1Y2xouTdjA_5 0 WE'VE GOT OUR CONFECTIONERS SUGAR BUTTER VANILLA AND CREAM CHEESE
H1Y2xouTdjA_6 0 WE'RE GOING TO START BY TAKING THE BUTTER AND THE CREAM CHEESE AND MIXING THOSE IN FIRST
H1Y2xouTdjA_7 0 NOW THIS ICING SMELLS SO GOOD AND THE TEXTURE'S GOING TO BE SO GREAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE LICKING YOUR FINGERS WHEN YOU'RE DONE
H1Y2xouTdjA_9 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR BUTTER AND THIS IS TWO STICKS OF BUTTER
H1Y2xouTdjA_10 0 I'VE ALREADY MELTED MY BUTTER
H1Y2xouTdjA_11 0 YOU CAN EITHER MELT YOUR BUTTER IN THE MICROWAVE OR YOU CAN JUST LET IT SIT OUT AT ROOM TEMPERATURE
H1Y2xouTdjA_12 0 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR CREAM CHEESE AND WE'RE GOING TO ADD THAT IN
H1Y2xouTdjA_13 0 THAT'S A FULL EIGHT OUNCES
H1Y2xouTdjA_14 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO TURN OUR MIXER ON AND START TO CREAM THE TWO
H1Y2xouTdjA_15 0 I'M GOING TO START OUT AT A VERY LOW SPEED
H1Y2xouTdjA_16 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR SUGAR OUR CONFECTIONER SUGAR AND ADD THAT IN
H1Y2xouTdjA_17 0 WE'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT HALF AND HALF
H1Y2xouTdjA_18 0 THE TEXTURE'S CHANGING AND THE SAME THING WHEN WE WERE ADDING OUR CAKE FLOUR TO OUR MIX WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE OUR TIME AND MIX EVENLY
H1Y2xouTdjA_19 0 I'M GOING TO ADD THE LAST HALF
H1Y2xouTdjA_20 0 AND I'M JUST GOING TO TURN THE BOWL
H1Y2xouTdjA_21 0 I'M GOING TO TURN THE SPEED UP JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE
H1Y2xouTdjA_22 0 WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MIX ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS EVENLY
H1Y2xouTdjA_23 0 SO I'M JUST TAKING IT AND I'M PULLING AROUND THE SIDES
H1Y2xouTdjA_24 0 MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS GETTING IN HERE
H1Y2xouTdjA_26 0 THIS IS THE LAST STEP
H1Y2xouTdjA_27 0 WE'RE ONLY GOING TO PUT ABOUT A TEASPOON IN HERE
H1Y2xouTdjA_28 0 WE DON'T WANT TO PUT TOO MUCH BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO TURN THE ICING DARK AND WE DON'T WANT THAT
H1Y2xouTdjA_29 0 AND IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT TOO BITTER
H1Y2xouTdjA_30 0 SO I'M GOING TO ESTIMATE ABOUT A TEASPOON FULL
H1Y2xouTdjA_31 0 AND REALLY THE ICING IS TO TASTE
H1Y2xouTdjA_32 0 SO IF YOU REALLY LIKE SUGARY YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE JUST A SUGAR-HOLIC GO AHEAD AND TASTE
H1Y2xouTdjA_33 0 AND ADD MORE OR IF YOU JUST LIKE A LOT OF CREAM CHEESE YOU CAN ALWAYS ADD MORE CREAM CHEESE
H1Y2xouTdjA_34 0 IT'S REALLY TO TASTE
H1Y2xouTdjA_35 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO MIX THIS IN NOW
H1Y2xouTdjA_36 0 SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS AND WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE REFRIGERATOR
H1Y2xouTdjA_37 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE IT IN FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES JUST SO THAT IT GETS THICK ENOUGH
H1Y2xouTdjA_38 0 BECAUSE ONCE WE PULL OUR CAKES OUT WE'RE GOING TO LET OUR CAKES COOL BEFORE WE PUT ON THE ICING
H1Y2xouTdjA_39 0 AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE REALLY COOL BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU I'VE MADE A FEW MISTAKES
H1Y2xouTdjA_40 0 I'VE PUT THE ICING ON PUT THE SECOND LAYER ON AND MY CAKE SLID
H1Y2xouTdjA_41 0 AND IT WAS LIKE A LOP- SIDED CAKE
H1Y2xouTdjA_42 0 IT'S NOT PRETTY AND IT'S NOT FUN TO FIX
H1Y2xouTdjA_43 0 SO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR CAKES HAVE COOLED AND THEN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR ICING HAS SAT IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR AT LEAST FIFTEEN MINUTES
H1Y2xouTdjA_44 0 AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
GTtZQuHQABQ_1 0 HI THIS IS KAREN FROM EXPERT VILLAGE

GTtZQuHQABQ_9 0 IF YOU PUT THAT IN THE REFRIGERATOR IT WILL SET RIGHT UP AND THAT IS OUR GHOSTY CUPCAKE
GDRGPctnjW4_1 0 PATIENTS OFTEN ASK ME HOW IS IT THAT THE SPINE RELATES TO THE SYMPTOMS THAT I HAVE HAVING HOW IS IT THAT THE SPINE THESE BONES ARE CREATING PAIN OR SOME KIND OF DYSFUNCTION I DON'T UNDERSTAND
GDRGPctnjW4_2 0 WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO IS THAT THE SPINE IS THE HOUSE THAT PROTECTS THE NERVES THAT ARE TRANSMITTING THESE MESSAGES AND SO AS THE SPINE GETS MISALIGNED AS THE SPINE GETS TORN OR TWISTED OR WHAT HAVE YOU IT PUTS PRESSURE ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT THEN IS SENDING THE MESSAGE OUT AND WHICH CAN BE PAIN OR FUNCTION
GDRGPctnjW4_3 0 SO PAIN FIBERS ARE BEING AFFECTED AND THEY ARE GOING TO FEEL PAIN WHETHER IT IS BURNING OR RADIATING PAIN LOCAL PAIN MUSCLE TENSION PRESSURE OR THOSE KINDS OF THINGS
GDRGPctnjW4_4 0 BUT ADDITIONALLY AS I MENTIONED THERE ARE FUNCTIONING FIBERS AS WELL AND IN THIS DIAGRAM AGAIN THE BRAIN IS UP HERE THIS IS THE SPINE AND THE CORD COMING DOWN HERE AND THERE IS DIFFERENT FIBERS THAT ARE COMING OUT AT THE DIFFERENT LEVELS AND THIS SHOWS VERY WELL SOME OF THE SYSTEMIC RESPONSIBILITIES SO AT THE TOP AGAIN WE ARE SEEING THINGS LIKE THE EYES THE TONGUE THE SALIVATORY GLANDS COMING DOWN THE MIDDLE THE HEART THE LUNGS FOR THE DOWNWARD ANGLE THE STOMACH THE KIDNEYS INTESTINAL DIGESTIVE THINGS BLADDER FUNCTION IS DOWN HERE
GDRGPctnjW4_5 0 SO WITH THE LOWER BACK AND PRETTY MUCH THE AREA THAT THESE THINGS ARE IN SUCH AS THE BLADDER AND DIGESTIVE ORGANS THESE THINGS CAN BE AFFECTED
GDRGPctnjW4_6 0 SO AGAIN THERE IS A GREAT CORRELATION TO THE LOWER BACK AND TO HOW THINGS WORK AS WELL AS WITH PAIN
gAetCwTmg30_1 0 REVERSE SHOULDER THROW
gAetCwTmg30_2 0 A REVERSE SHOULDER THROW IS MORE OF A CATCH THAN A THROW BUT THAT'S A REGULAR SHOULDER THROW AND THEY TEND TO HURT MY WRISTS SO I DON'T DO THOSE
gAetCwTmg30_3 0 BUT REVERSE SHOULDER THROWS ARE THE OPPOSITE OF THAT
gAetCwTmg30_4 0 THE OPPOSITE MEANING INSTEAD OF THROWING OVER YOUR SHOULDER YOU CATCH OVER YOUR SHOULDER
gAetCwTmg30_5 0 IT'S KIND OF LIKE A PENGUIN BUT YOUR HAND IS TURNED INWARDS AND BACK AND IT'S A BLIND CATCH WHICH MAKES IT A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT BUT NOT AS DIFFICULT AS IT SOUNDS
gAetCwTmg30_6 0 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS REALLY BE CONSCIOUS OF KEEPING THE BALL LOW OR IN OTHER WORDS YOU DON'T WANT THE BALL REALLY HIGH THROWS THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO CATCH
gAetCwTmg30_7 0 KEEP IT LOW AND REALLY BE CONSCIOUS OF THE BALL TRAVELING PAST YOUR EAR AND DROPPING RIGHT BEHIND YOUR SHOULDER AND IF YOU HAVE TO KICK YOUR SHOULDER OUT A LITTLE BIT FORWARD TO GET YOUR ARM BACK THERE THAT'S OK
gAetCwTmg30_8 0 THE WAY IT LOOKS AND IT'S JUST LIKE A BACK CROSS OR ANYTHING THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IS THE THROW PRECEDING THE TRICK
gAetCwTmg30_9 0 SO THE THROW PRECEDING I'LL MAKE OUT OF MY RIGHT HAND THAT'S THE THROW PRECEDING IT AND THE CATCH
gAetCwTmg30_10 0 SO WHOOPS THERE WE GO
gAetCwTmg30_11 0 UP CATCH BEHIND YOU AND YOU LEARN IT WITH BOTH HAND THOSE ARE REVERSE SHOULDER THROWS

GmQx-jsZ5GE_2 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT SAFETY TIPS TO HELP KEEP YOUR FAMILY SAFE AT THEME PARKS
GmQx-jsZ5GE_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING BOTH ABOUT REGULAR THEME PARKS AS WELL AS WATER PARKS WHICH OBVIOUSLY CARRY WITH THEM THEIR OWN SET OF CONCERNS BUT YOU CAN STILL HAVE A GOOD TIME AS LONG AS YOU'RE CAREFUL TO BE SAFE
GmQx-jsZ5GE_4 0 YOU REALLY ARE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF YOUR DAY GOING TO WANT TO HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE
GmQx-jsZ5GE_5 0 IF YOUR CHILDREN ARE OLD ENOUGH THAT THEY CAN WANDER OFF BY THEMSELVES AT ANY GIVEN POINT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE A PLAN TO MEET BACK A PLAN IF THEY GET LOST AND SOME GUIDELINES AND RULES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FOLLOW WHEN THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN
GmQx-jsZ5GE_6 0 IF YOUR CHILDREN ARE YOUNGER YOU ALSO ARE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE A PLAN OF ACTION IF FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY GET SEPARATED FROM YOU
GmQx-jsZ5GE_7 0 YOU DON'T WANT CHILDREN TO PANIC AND NOT ALREADY HAVE SOME PLAN IN PLACE
GmQx-jsZ5GE_8 0 IT REALLY DOES HELP MATTERS IF YOUR CHILDREN ARE LOST OR SEPARATED IF YOU'VE ALREADY TOLD THEM WHAT TO DO AND THEY ALREADY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT
GmQx-jsZ5GE_9 0 AND OBVIOUSLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO IS TO ASSURE YOUR CHILD THAT YOU WILL NEVER LEAVE WHEREVER YOU ARE UNTIL YOU'RE REUNITED
GmQx-jsZ5GE_10 0 YOU DON'T WANT A CHILD EVER LEAVING A LOCATION NOT GOING WITH YOU FEARING THAT YOU'VE LEFT WITHOUT THEM ASSURE THEM THAT THAT WILL NEVER EVER BE THE CASE
GTEAbhL7rRM_1 0 ALRIGHT THE DRINK WE ARE ABOUT TO MAKE IS CALLED FISH HOUSE PUNCH
GTEAbhL7rRM_2 0 NOW OBVIOUSLY BEING A PUNCH THIS IS MEANT TO BE SERVED AS A VERY LARGE PUNCH FOR A LOT OF GUESTS
GTEAbhL7rRM_3 0 MAYBE AT A PARTY YOU ARE HAVING OR ANYTHING ELSE
GTEAbhL7rRM_4 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE IT AS JUST ONE DRINK OK FIRST OFF FILL A GLASS WITH ICE AND MEASURE OUT ONE SHOT OF DARK RUM
GTEAbhL7rRM_5 0 AND FOLLOW THAT UP WITH HALF A SHOT OF BRANDY

g7AmqhexyJY_1 0 HI I'M AMELIA AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THE PERFECT EYEBROW
g7AmqhexyJY_2 0 FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE EXTREMELY DARK HAIR AND WANT TO GO LIGHT WE CAN TINT OUR EYEBROWS
g7AmqhexyJY_3 0 WE CAN USE THE SAME COLOR AND JUST LIGHTEN THEM UP
g7AmqhexyJY_4 0 IF YOU'VE GOT GREY HAIR OR IF YOU'RE VERY BLONDE YOU'RE NATURALLY BLONDE I WOULD DEFINITELY SUGGEST HAVING YOUR EYEBROWS TINTED OR AT LEAST FILLING THEM IN
g7AmqhexyJY_5 0 SO THAT WAY YOU AT LEAST LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE BROWS
g7AmqhexyJY_6 0 A LOT OF WOMEN WILL GO AND HAVE THEIR EYEBROWS TINTED OR EVEN TATTOOED ON AND THEN THAT'S ONE LESS STEP THEY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IN THE MORNING AS FAR AS APPLYING THE MAKEUP
g7AmqhexyJY_7 0 A TINT WOULD JUST SIMPLY BE YOU WOULD GO IN AND YOU WOULD LAY DOWN THEY WOULD COVER YOUR EYES WITH CLOSE YOUR EYE FOR ME COVER YOUR EYE WITH SOME COTTON
g7AmqhexyJY_8 0 AND THEN THEY WOULD MIX UP THE TINT YOU CHOOSE AND THEY WOULD JUST APPLY IT TO THE EYEBROW LET IT PROCESS REMOVE IT AND THEN YOU'D BE DONE
g7AmqhexyJY_9 0 YOU COULD CHANGE YOUR EYEBROW THAT QUICKLY
g7AmqhexyJY_10 0 I DO RECOMMEND IF YOU'RE GOING TO TINT YOUR EYEBROWS GO WITH A DARKER COLOR
g7AmqhexyJY_11 0 I DON'T REALLY RECOMMEND GOING FROM DARK TO BLONDE BECAUSE YOU START TO SEE THAT RE-GROWTH AND IT CAN LOOK VERY STRANGE
g7AmqhexyJY_12 0 AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT THE MAINTENANCE IS VERY HIGH
g7AmqhexyJY_13 0 SO JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU TAKE THAT IN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN CHOOSING YOUR EYEBROW COLOR
GPL0E6vaDu0_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS GALE STOLOVE WITH WHOLLY MACRO IN FORT LAUDERDALE FLORIDA
GPL0E6vaDu0_2 0 TODAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT COOKING THE MACROBIOTIC WAY
GPL0E6vaDu0_3 0 SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I REALIZE EARLY ON DOING THIS DIET IS I WOULD NEVER SURVIVE IF I DIDN'T HAVE HEALTHY DESSERTS
GPL0E6vaDu0_4 0 I HAVE A SWEET TOOTH AND I NEED HEALTHY DESSERTS AND I ALSO REALIZE THAT NO ONE WAS EVER GOING TO LIKE THIS WAY OF EATING OR RESPECT IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE HEALTHY DESSERTS ALSO
GPL0E6vaDu0_5 0 SO I LEARNED HOW TO MAKE REALLY HEALTHY DESSERTS USING ALL NATURAL PRODUCTS THEY ARE FAT FREE THEY ARE CHOLESTEROL FREE AND WHAT I HAVE HERE ARE OATMEAL CREAM SANDWICH BARS

H5wpEB1CeAs_1 0 HERE WE HAVE AN UNDERWIRE BIKINI TOP WITH THE REGULAR BIKINI BOTTOMS
H5wpEB1CeAs_2 0 NOT SIDE TIED
H5wpEB1CeAs_3 0 JUST PLAIN OLD BATHING SUIT
H5wpEB1CeAs_4 0 AGAIN THIS IS ADAPTED FROM MY LINGERIE COLLECTION
H5wpEB1CeAs_5 0 I LIKE TO USE THE STRIPES BECAUSE IT DOES GIVE IT MORE OF A BATHING SUIT SPORTY FLARE
H5wpEB1CeAs_6 0 WHEN YOU'RE DESIGNING THINGS YOU COULD DO BOY SHORTS AT THE BOTTOM
H5wpEB1CeAs_7 0 YOU COULD DO ANYTHING STRIPES AND IF THEY'RE DIAGONAL WILL ALWAYS WORK
H5wpEB1CeAs_8 0 OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE DESIGNING ON A VERY SKINNY PERSON
H5wpEB1CeAs_9 0 BUT IN REALITY WHEN IT GOES TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING YOUR IDEAS IN FABRIC SKINNY PEOPLE WEAR DIAGONAL STRIPES
H5wpEB1CeAs_10 0 THAT'S JUST KEY TO REMEMBER
H5wpEB1CeAs_11 0 AND WE HAVE A TEENY TINY BIKINI THAT'S VERY VERY LOW CUT
H5wpEB1CeAs_12 0 THERE'S THE BELLY BUTTON
H5wpEB1CeAs_13 0 IT HITS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIPS
H5wpEB1CeAs_14 0 THIN STRAPS ON THE SIDE
H5wpEB1CeAs_15 0 THEN I DIDN'T MAKE HER MY LINES

H5wpEB1CeAs_18 0 AND THEN ADD YOUR STRIPES
H5wpEB1CeAs_19 0 AND THEN ADD A LITTLE BIT OF YOU
H5wpEB1CeAs_20 0 AND THAT'S IT
gTiBlv8ei1o_1 0 HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE BEST MOTORCYCLE HELMETS THAT YOU CAN BUY OR FOR PROTECTION WISE
gTiBlv8ei1o_2 0 ON A STREET TYPE HELMET OBVIOUSLY OF COURSE THE BEST WOULD BE A FULL FACE HELMET
gTiBlv8ei1o_3 0 SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHICH GIVES YOU GOOD SOLID PROTECTION A CHANGEABLE SHIELD THAT OPENS AND CLOSES AND HAS VENTILATION ON IT
gTiBlv8ei1o_4 0 A DOT APPROVED HELMET AND LIGHTWEIGHT
gTiBlv8ei1o_5 0 AS FAR AS GETTING WHAT WE WOULD CALL THE BEST OR BETTER HELMETS OUT THERE YOU WOULD WANT TO GET A HIGH QUALITY SHOEI OR AN ARISE TYPE HELMET WHICH IS BOTH JAPANESE MADE
gTiBlv8ei1o_6 0 THEY FAR EXCEED THE DOT APPROVAL RATINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO SELL A HELMET IN THE UNITED STATES AND THEY ARE ALSO SNOW APPROVED WHICH MEANS THEY GO THROUGH A LOT MORE TESTING BEFORE THEY ARE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC
gTiBlv8ei1o_7 0 THESE ARE ALSO THE TYPES OF HELMETS THAT ARE USED BY PROFESSIONAL ROAD RACERS AND BY FAR THE SAFEST AND BEST HELMETS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC
gTiBlv8ei1o_8 0 WHEN YOU CONSIDER BUYING A HELMET AND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE BEST ONE OBVIOUSLY WE TALKED ABOUT THE RATINGS THAT THEY OFFER YOU ALSO JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT HAS THE SHIELD CAN BE CHANGED FOR TINTED SHATTERPROOF TYPE SHIELD
gTiBlv8ei1o_9 0 ALSO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE SIZED CORRECTLY WHILE BUYING THE HELMET
gTiBlv8ei1o_10 0 IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU HAVE A VERY EXPENSIVE OR THE BEST HELMET OUT THERE IF IT'S NOT SIZED CORRECTLY IT WILL NOT PROTECT YOU THE WAY IT WAS DESIGNED TO
GmTdLtPJb9U_1 0 HI THIS IS JOHN STEWART AND THIS IS HOW TO ACCESS THE SURROUNDING AREAS IN CASE YOU HAVE TO SURVIVE IN NATURE
GmTdLtPJb9U_2 0 IF YOU'RE HAVING TO SURVIVE IN NATURE MOST OF TIME YOU'VE GOTTEN LOST YOU'VE BEEN STRANDED
GmTdLtPJb9U_3 0 SOMETHINGS CRASHED AND YOU'RE OUT THERE ALL ALONE
GmTdLtPJb9U_4 0 OK BEFOREHAND YOU SHOULD HAVE PROBABLY LOOKED INTO SOME STUFF
GmTdLtPJb9U_5 0 MAPS IF YOU WERE FLYING OVER AND SOMETHING AND YOU SAW STUFF
GmTdLtPJb9U_6 0 YOU CAN KNOW THE AREA THAT'S SURROUNDING YOU
GmTdLtPJb9U_7 0 YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS BY CLIMBING TO A HIGHER POINT
GmTdLtPJb9U_8 0 CLIMBING A MOUNTAIN GETTING IN A TALL TREE THAT GOES ABOVE THE NORMAL CANOPY OF THE TREES
GmTdLtPJb9U_9 0 JUST LOOK OUT AND SEE YOUR SURROUNDINGS AREAS
GmTdLtPJb9U_10 0 YOU CAN LOOK FOR CLEARINGS MOST OF THE TIME THAT'S GOING TO BE BODY'S OF WATERS FIELDS STUFF LIKE THAT
GmTdLtPJb9U_11 0 YOU CAN LISTEN FOR CARS THAT'S MEANS THERE'S GOING TO BE ROAD NEARBY
GmTdLtPJb9U_12 0 YOU CAN FEEL FIND BODIES OF WATER THAT ARE MOVING CREAKS RIVERS MOST OF THE TIME THEY LEAD TO A BIGGER BODY OF WATER
GmTdLtPJb9U_13 0 WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO FIND MORE PEOPLE
GmTdLtPJb9U_14 0 THERE'LL BE PEOPLE THERE THAT CAN HELP YOU BUT THE MAIN THIS IS YOU WANT TO KNOW YOUR SURROUNDINGS
GmTdLtPJb9U_15 0 BEFORE YOU GO INTO PARK KNOW THAT THERE'S A ROAD ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE PARK AND KNOW THAT THERE'S A RIVER WITH MARINA ON IT
GmTdLtPJb9U_16 0 ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE PARK
GmTdLtPJb9U_17 0 SO YOU SHOULD PRE LOOK INTO ALL THE THINGS BEFORE YOUR TRIP
GmTdLtPJb9U_18 0 SO THAT YOU HAVE A ROUGH IDEA OF WHAT YOUR SURROUNDINGS ARE BUT IF YOU DON'T DO THIS
GmTdLtPJb9U_19 0 YOU CAN EASILY ACCOMPLISH THIS LIKE I SAID BY CLIMBING TO A HIGHER POINT AND LOOKING OVER THE LANDSCAPE
GmTdLtPJb9U_20 0 THIS IS HOW TO ADAPT TO YOUR SURROUNDINGS IN CASE YOU HAVE TO SURVIVE IN NATURE
g9sdNEaUOZE_1 0 WHEN CONSIDERING WHAT TYPE OF TELESCOPE YOU'D LIKE TO BUY AS YOUR FIRST INSTRUMENT IT WOULD BE VERY NICE TO GO AND LOOK AND SEE WHAT DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS DO HOW WELL THEY SEE THE SKY AND WHAT THEY CAN SHOW YOU
g9sdNEaUOZE_2 0 A GOOD WAY TO DO THIS IS TO GO TO STAR PARTIES OR PLACES WHERE AMATEUR ASTRONOMERS MEET GREET AND SHOW OFF THEIR EQUIPMENT
g9sdNEaUOZE_3 0 AND THEY LOVE TO DO IT
g9sdNEaUOZE_4 0 MOST ASTRONOMERS SIT OUT AT NIGHT ALONE THEY SEE INCREDIBLE THINGS AND THEY LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO PULL SOMEBODY TO THE SIDE AND AND GET THEM TO LOOK IN THE EYEPIECE AND SEE THE BEAUTY THAT THEY SEE
g9sdNEaUOZE_5 0 SO IT SHOULD BE FAIRLY SIMPLE IF YOU'RE ON THE INTERNET OF COURSE
g9sdNEaUOZE_6 0 LOOK FOR A ASTRONOMY CLUB IN YOUR AREA
g9sdNEaUOZE_7 0 THEY'LL HOLD MEETINGS AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE MONTH OR HAVE STAR PARTIES
g9sdNEaUOZE_8 0 OBSERVATORIES AT COLLEGE CAMPUSES OFTEN HAVE PUBLIC NIGHTS AND AMATEUR ASTRONOMERS WILL BE ON HAND THERE TO SHOW THEIR INSTRUMENTS
g9sdNEaUOZE_9 0 AND IT'S GOOD TO GET THE EXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN OUT USED DIFFERENT KINDS OF TELESCOPES BEFORE YOU PURCHASE YOURS
G5GOtRmEeBk_1 0 IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PRESSURE WASH YOUR POOL DECK AREA
G5GOtRmEeBk_2 0 THERE'S SOME GRIME
G5GOtRmEeBk_3 0 YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TRY TO PRE-WET THE AREA LIKE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE
G5GOtRmEeBk_4 0 PRE-WET IT SEE WHERE THE WATER'S GOING TO RUN
G5GOtRmEeBk_5 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE PRESSURE WASHER IN A LARGER SWEEPING MOTION
G5GOtRmEeBk_6 0 THIS DECK WAS DONE NOT TOO LONG AGO
G5GOtRmEeBk_7 0 AND YOU CAN SEE HOW THE MUD STARTS TO PILE UP
G5GOtRmEeBk_8 0 SOMETIMES WITH THESE SCREEN ENCLOSURES THE WATER'S GOING TO START TO POND UP
G5GOtRmEeBk_9 0 SO YOU ALWAYS NEED TO BE KEEPING AN EYE ON WHERE THE WATER'S GOING TO POND UP TO GET IT AWAY OF THE AREA THAT YOU'RE CLEANING
G5GOtRmEeBk_10 0 SO MY MAIN POINT IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE CLEANING A POOL AREA ESPECIALLY ONE WITH AN ENCLOSURE YOU NEED TO USE MORE OF LIKE A SWEEPING MOTION ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE SWEEPING THE MUD AND WATER OUT OF THE DOOR

HDzLxD6V59A_21 0 AND TURNING THE BROWN STOCK INTO WHAT'S CALLED AN ESPAGNOL SAUCE WHICH HAS SOME TOMATO PASTE
HDzLxD6V59A_22 0 THEN ONCE YOU'VE MADE THOSE YOU MIX THEM TOGETHER AND REDUCE THEM BY HALF

GcpnJMAZmXo_3 0 SO A RIDER WHO'S IN A WHEELCHAIR WHO HAS CEREBRAL PALSY WHO HAS STIFF MUSCLES IN THEIR LEGS
GcpnJMAZmXo_4 0 THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO START BECAUSE THEY CAN UTILIZE THE SUPPORT OF SIDE WALKERS EASIER AS WELL AS THEIR LEGS DON'T HAVE TO BE IN THE DOWN POSITION TO BE ABLE TO RIDE
GcpnJMAZmXo_5 0 THEIR LEGS CAN BE A LITTLE HIGHER UP BECAUSE THEIR LEGS ARE TIGHTER
GcpnJMAZmXo_6 0 IT'S ALSO COMFORTABLE IT'S GOING TO HELP WITH ANY TYPE OF SKIN SKIN BREAKDOWN OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT'S MORE OF A COMFORTABLE SADDLE
GcpnJMAZmXo_7 0 IT ALSO ALLOWS THE RIDER TO FEEL THE HORSE MORE BECAUSE IT'S CLOSER TO THE HORSE
GcpnJMAZmXo_8 0 THE HEAT OF THE HORSE CAN COME UP THROUGH THE SADDLE TO HELP RELAX MUSCLES THAT ARE TIGHT
GcpnJMAZmXo_9 0 THERE'S A HANDLE HERE TO HELP AGAIN FOR SAFETY THE RIDER CAN HOLE ON
GcpnJMAZmXo_10 0 THERE ARE STIRRUPS THAT CAN BE ATTACHED TO THIS OR THAT OR IT CAN BE RIDDEN WITHOUT STIRRUPS AND THIS GENERALLY FITS MOST OF THE HORSES BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE A SOLID TREE UNDERNEATH
GBgFH6pd22Q_1 0 AND IN HERE THE FIXED GLOBES YOU WILL SEE WHICH IS SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE ON THE FLUID LAMPS
GBgFH6pd22Q_2 0 THESE BURNERS ACTUALLY COME OUT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE LANTERNS
GBgFH6pd22Q_3 0 THEY WOULD WALK THE STREETS WITH HOLDING THE HANDLE LIKE THIS TO THEIR SIZE TO LIGHT UP THEIR WALKWAY IN THE 1850'S
GBgFH6pd22Q_4 0 THIS BURNER WILL SLIDE RIGHT OUT AND THERE IS WHERE YOUR FLUID WILL BE PUT IN AND HERE ARE THE SMALL TOPS WHERE THE WICK ACTUALLY COMES OUT ON BOTH BURNERS
GBgFH6pd22Q_5 0 THIS BURNER ITSELF IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU WOULD SEE ON ONE OF THESE FLUID LAMPS
GBgFH6pd22Q_6 0 IT WOULD LOOK VERY SIMILAR TO THIS
GBgFH6pd22Q_7 0 THERE IS YOUR WICK WHICH IS SATURATED WITH YOUR OIL AND THIS FLUID IS HELD INSIDE THIS CONTAINER AND IT IS SCREWED ON TO A NUMBER ONE COLLAR
GBgFH6pd22Q_8 0 SO THIS IS NOT THE SAME BUT VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU WOULD SEE ON THIS LAMP HERE
GBgFH6pd22Q_9 0 IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT THE ORIGINAL LAMP WOULD LOOK LIKE
GBgFH6pd22Q_10 0 SO THERE IS TWO CENTER WICKS THAT YOU PULL UP HERE AND WOULD BURN YOUR FLUID
GBgFH6pd22Q_11 0 WE WILL PUT THAT BACK IN THERE
GBgFH6pd22Q_12 0 THAT IS WHAT THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE ON A FIXED GLOBE
GBgFH6pd22Q_13 0 IT IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE ONE NEXT TO IT
GBgFH6pd22Q_14 0 THIS LANTERN IS THE SAME TYPE OF APPARATUS WHERE IT IS FIXED UNDERNEATH
GBgFH6pd22Q_15 0 I WILL SHOW YOU THE BOTTOM WHERE IT HAS TWO PIECES THAT YOU PUT TOGETHER IN A SPRING FORM AND PULL IT OUT AND THERE IS YOUR FIXED GLOBE
GBgFH6pd22Q_16 0 ANOTHER SIMILAR BURNER ON THE TOP BUT ALSO THIS ONE IS BRASS WITH TWO SMALL BURNERS AND WHAT COMES OUT OF THOSE IS THE WICK WHICH IS SATURATED FROM THE FUEL UNDERNEATH AND THE BURNER
GBgFH6pd22Q_17 0 SO THAT SLIDES BACK UP INTO THE GLOBE AND IT ATTACHES SO THAT IT CAN BE CARRIED AND HANDLED AS YOU ARE WALKING SO THESE WERE GREAT FOR POLICEMAN WALKING THE STREET AT NIGHT OR RAILROAD STATION OR ON CORNERS OF A STREET AT NIGHT WHEN THERE WASN'T ANY LIGHTING
GBgFH6pd22Q_18 0 THESE WERE GREAT TO USE WHEN YOU WALKED AROUND IN TOWN
GBgFH6pd22Q_19 0 I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH LIGHT YOU GOT FROM THEM BUT THAT WAS THEIR LIGHT SOURCE IN THE MID 19TH CENTURY
H46ZsPX3n9s_1 0 YOU WERE LOOKING AT YOUR POLICY RECENTLY FOR YOUR AUTO INSURANCE AND YOU NOTICED THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO CHANGE
H46ZsPX3n9s_2 0 MY NAME IS JAMES
H46ZsPX3n9s_3 0 I'M WITH THE RESURGENCE GROUP
H46ZsPX3n9s_4 0 WE ARE A FULL SERVICE INSURANCE AGENCY AND WE SPECIALIZE IN AUTO INSURANCE
H46ZsPX3n9s_5 0 THE FIRST THING THAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS TO SPEAK WITH YOUR AGENT OR THE COSTUMER SERVICE AGENT OF THE CARRIER THAT YOU ARE DEALING WITH AND GO OVER WHAT SPECIFICALLY HAS CHANGED IN YOUR LIFE
H46ZsPX3n9s_6 0 SOMETIMES IT IS WHERE YOU NEED TO INCREASE DEDUCTIBLES TO LOWER YOUR PREMIUMS OR YOU WANT TO INCREASE YOUR LIMITS BECAUSE NOW YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR EXPOSURE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO BODILY INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE OR UNINSURED MOTORISTS WHICH IS A BIG THING
H46ZsPX3n9s_7 0 IN THE EVENT THAT YOU ARE IN A CAR ACCIDENT WITH SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T HAVE INSURANCE THAT IS WHERE YOUR UNINSURED MOTORISTS WOULD COME IN AND THOSE LIMITS CAN GO ANYWHERE FROM 10/20 ALL THE WAY UP TO A MILLION DOLLARS SO AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF RISKS THAT YOU CURRENTLY FEEL THAT YOU HAVE AND JUST THAT COMFORT ZONE FOR THAT LEVEL OF COMFORT THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT YOU ARE PROPERLY INSURED
H46ZsPX3n9s_8 0 MY NAME IS JAMES WITH THE RESURGENCE GROUP AND WE SPECIALIZE IN AUTO INSURANCE AND THE ONE THING THAT WE REALLY TRY AND STRESS IS THAT IT IS NICE TO HAVE AN AGENT THAT YOU CAN GO IN AND SEE AND SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS WITH THEM ALL OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS OVER THE YEARS THAT CHANGE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE PROPER INSURANCE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU NEED IT AND THAT IS WHEN THEY HAVE THAT LOSS WHEN YOU HAVE AN ACCIDENT AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE PROPERLY COVERED
GDeyxGoOWnQ_1 0 HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
GDeyxGoOWnQ_2 0 WHAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS WHEN YOU USE THE GUARD EFFECTIVELY AS A PULLING GUARD
GDeyxGoOWnQ_3 0 WE MUST MAKE SURE OF A FEW THINGS WHEN WE PULL OUR GUARD
GDeyxGoOWnQ_4 0 ONE WHEN THIS GUARD PULLS OUT THAT WILL LEAVE A BIG HOLE ON THIS SIDE
GDeyxGoOWnQ_5 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU PULL THE GUARD YOU HAVE A RUNNING BACK COMING THROUGH OR THAT THE TACKLE KNOWS THAT HE HAS TO COVER OR WE HAVE A TIGHT END CRACKING DOWN ETC
GDeyxGoOWnQ_6 0 WE WANT TO FILL THE SPOT OF THE GUARD
GDeyxGoOWnQ_7 0 WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE A BIG OPEN HOLE
GDeyxGoOWnQ_8 0 LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW THE GUARD PULLS OUT VIDEO DEMO
GDeyxGoOWnQ_9 0 WHEN THIS GUARD PULLS WE WANT HIM TO TAKE ONE STEP BACK
GDeyxGoOWnQ_10 0 HIS INSIDE FOOT COMES BACK AND HE IS RIGHT ALONG THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE
GDeyxGoOWnQ_11 0 WHEN HE PULLS WE DON'T WANT THIS GUARD TO BE IN THE BACKFIELD BECAUSE WE MAY BE BRINGING A RUN RIGHT AHEAD OF HIM
GDeyxGoOWnQ_12 0 ONCE HE GETS ON THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE HE'S GOING TO RUN A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE RIGHT DOWN THE LINE AND HE'LL HIT THE FIRST THING HE SEES IN THE OPPOSITE JERSEY
GDeyxGoOWnQ_13 0 ONE THING TO TELL YOUR GUARDS WHEN THEY PULL OUT IS FOR THE FIRST FEW TIMES YOU MAY BE HITTING YOUR OWN GUYS
GDeyxGoOWnQ_14 0 THAT IS NOT THEIR FAULT
GDeyxGoOWnQ_15 0 WHEN A GUARD PULLS OUT HE HAS TO GO AT A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE
GDeyxGoOWnQ_16 0 HE CAN'T MOVE BECAUSE THE CENTER IS BACK A LITTLE OR THE TACKLE IS BACK A LITTLE
GDeyxGoOWnQ_17 0 HE HAS TO RUN OVER ANYBODY IN HIS PATH WHEN HE PULLS OUT
GDeyxGoOWnQ_18 0 IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE GUARD STAYS AT A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE RIGHT DOWN THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE

GW32A8jN18I_22 0 THIS IS THE HAIR STUDIO
GW32A8jN18I_23 0 AND THIS IS HOW YOU CAN GET A CURLY UP DO
GFKMytY-yjA_1 0 ONE THING THAT YOU NEED TO REMEMBER ABOUT TELLING THE WHOLE CROWD WHAT YOUR PLATFORM IS THAT YOU NEED TO STAND UP STRAIGHT AND HAVE GOOD POSTURE AND WHATEVER YOU DO HAVE EYE CONTACT WITH THE JUDGES AND THE CROWD SO THAT YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE VERY CONFIDENT AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
GFKMytY-yjA_2 0 NOW I'M GOING TO BACKTRACK AND TELL YOU HOW TO PREPARE YOUR PLATFORM STATEMENT STARTING WITH STEP ONE
GFKMytY-yjA_3 0 OR 26TH CONTESTANT ASHLEY ELIZABETH CHARLSON
GFKMytY-yjA_4 0 THE FIRST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS HOW TO CHOOSE A PLATFORM
GFKMytY-yjA_5 0 IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH COMMUNITY SERVICE OR YOU'RE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE THAT'S REALLY A PLUS FOR FINDING WHAT YOUR PLATFORM IS GOING TO BE
GFKMytY-yjA_6 0 YOU NEED TO CHOOSE A TOPIC THAT YOU HAVE INTEREST IN AND STUDY AT AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC AREA
GFKMytY-yjA_7 0 SOME EXAMPLES OF SOME PLATFORMS ARE PREVENTION OF HOMELESSNESS THE IMPORTANCE OF FINE ARTS EDUCATION AND UNDERAGE DRINKING
h7XT7qhKU1Q_1 0 SO I'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT WHILE WE'RE IN THE LIGHT HERE RATHER THAN IN THE DARK ROOM ABOUT REALLY JUST WHAT A CONTACT SHEET IS
h7XT7qhKU1Q_2 0 A CONTACT SHEET IS YOUR NEGATIVES AND YOU LAY THEM ON TOP OF A PIECE OF PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPER IN THE DARK ROOM
h7XT7qhKU1Q_3 0 AND THEN AFTER THE NEGATIVES ARE ON TOP OF THE PAPER YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A SHEET OF GLASS OR A CONTACT SHEET PRINTER
h7XT7qhKU1Q_4 0 BUT AGAIN THE MOST AFFORDABLE WAY IS JUST TO USE A NICE QUARTER INCH THICK SHEET OF GLASS
h7XT7qhKU1Q_5 0 AND WHAT YOU DO IS YOU LAY IT DOWN ON TOP OF THE PAPER
h7XT7qhKU1Q_6 0 LIGHT FROM THE ENLARGER EXPOSES GOES THROUGH YOUR NEGATIVES AND ONTO THE PAPER
h7XT7qhKU1Q_7 0 REALLY PRETTY SIMPLE
h7XT7qhKU1Q_8 0 BUT FOR SOME REASON I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE TIME FACTOR THING
h7XT7qhKU1Q_9 0 I FOUND THAT WHEN I BEGIN DOING THIS AND A LOT OF MY STUDENTS JUST LIKE TO LOOK AT THEIR NEGATIVES ON A LIGHT TABLE AND PRINT FROM THEM
h7XT7qhKU1Q_10 0 AND I CAN'T TRY TO TALK PEOPLE OUT OF THAT ENOUGH
h7XT7qhKU1Q_11 0 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WAY YOU PHOTOGRAPH ON A CONTACT SHEET YOU WILL SEE THE RHYTHM OF YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY
h7XT7qhKU1Q_12 0 YOU'LL ACTUALLY SEE THE WAY YOUR EYE LOOKS
h7XT7qhKU1Q_13 0 AND IT'S AN AMAZING LEARNING TOOL IF YOU JUST KEEP MAKING CONTACT SHEETS AND JUST LOOKING AT THEM THAT WAY
HaQ-wgHagyg_1 0 OKAY SO WE LEARNED FOUR BASIC KICKS FRONT KICK SIDE KICK BACK KICK AND ROUNDHOUSE KICK
HaQ-wgHagyg_2 0 THOSE ARE THE TRADITIONAL KICKS IN OKINAWA
HaQ-wgHagyg_3 0 WHEN IT WENT TO JAPAN AND WHEN THE KOREAN'S ADDED THEIRS THERE BECAME COUNTLESS OTHER VARIATIONS
HaQ-wgHagyg_4 0 AS YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL WITH THE HUMAN LIMB THERE'S ALMOST AN INFINITE NUMBER OF WAYS YOU CAN MOVE IT
HaQ-wgHagyg_5 0 INFINITE NUMBER OF COMBINATIONS THAT YOU CAN COME UP WITH
HaQ-wgHagyg_6 0 THE ONLY THING STOPPING IT IS THE HUMAN MIND
HaQ-wgHagyg_7 0 SO SOME VARIATIONS ARE YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOU ADD A CRESCENT KICK WHERE THE KICK COMES UP AND IT COMES OUT SLAPPING ON THE SIDE THE SIDE OF THE HEAD
HaQ-wgHagyg_8 0 CRESCENT KICKS YOU CAN EVEN GO FROM THE OTHER WAY
HaQ-wgHagyg_9 0 IF YOU ADD A SPIN TO THAT IT'S A LITTLE IT'S EASIER TO ACTUALLY GENERATE A LITTLE BIT MORE POWER IF YOU SPIN PUT A SPIN INTO THE CRESCENTS
HaQ-wgHagyg_10 0 FROM THERE YOU ALSO HAVE JUMPY KICKS LIKE I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW YOU JUST A JUMPING FRONT KICK
HaQ-wgHagyg_11 0 IF YOU JUST ADD A JUMP TO IT YOU CAN EVEN DOUBLE THE POWER
HaQ-wgHagyg_12 0 YOU ALSO GOT A JUMPING SIDE KICK WHICH IS EASIER TO RUN AND ACTUALLY LEAP INTO SOMETHING
HaQ-wgHagyg_13 0 BUT THESE ARE JUST DIFFERENT VARIATIONS THAT YOU CAN COME UP WITH
HaQ-wgHagyg_14 0 YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN ESPECIALLY IN THE KOREAN STYLES LIKE TAEKWONDO TANG SOO DO HOPKIDO
HaQ-wgHagyg_15 0 THEY LIKE TO DO A LOT OF HIGH SPINNING KICKS LOOK REALLY SPECTACULAR BUT THEY TAKE A LOT MORE YEARS TO MASTER
HaQ-wgHagyg_16 0 SO FROM HERE WE'RE GOING TO GO ON TO THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF KARATE LIKE KATA AND SPARRING AND SOME WEAPONS
h28nu6dOPEw_1 0 PAMELA YAGER OKAY NOW THAT I'VE CUT MY LITTLE PIECES OF RIBBON WHICH I'M GOING TO PUT ON MY FRAME I NEED TO DECIDE WHAT I'M GOING TO USE TO PUT ON THERE AND MAKE IT ADHERE
h28nu6dOPEw_2 0 AND I'VE DECIDED GLUE STICK IS GOING TO WORK BEST FOR THIS PROJECT CAUSE WE'RE USING GLASS AND THIS RIBBON MATERIAL AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO WORK BEST
h28nu6dOPEw_3 0 NOW WORKING WITH A GLUE STICK CAN SOMETIMES BE A LITTLE BIT TRICKY BECAUSE SOMETIMES GLUE STICKS CLUMP AND SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE USING IT A CERTAIN DIRECTION THE RIBBON STICKS TOGETHER SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS PLACE YOUR FINGER ON ONE END AND PUSH AWAY FROM YOURSELF WITH THE GLUE STICK
h28nu6dOPEw_4 0 GO AWAY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION JUST KEEP YOUR FINGERNAIL ON THERE AND PUT IT LIKE THAT
h28nu6dOPEw_5 0 I'M GONNA ACTUALLY PUT THE GLUE ON FIRST AND WE'RE PUTTING THE RIBBONS ON THE SIDE ON THE FRAME FIRST
h28nu6dOPEw_6 0 AND YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND A LITTLE BIT AND PUSH IT INTO PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE OVER ON THIS SIDE
h28nu6dOPEw_7 0 AND YOU START FROM ONE END AND JUST PRESS LIGHTLY TO MAKE IT STICK TO THE FRAME
h28nu6dOPEw_8 0 AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO OUR NEXT ONE AND PLACE IT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND THE REASON WHY WE'RE PUTTING IT ON THE EACH OF THE SIDES FIRST IS BECAUSE THEN WHEN WE PUT OUR RIBBON ON THE TOP IT'S GOING TO CROSS OVER AND MAKE A NICE CORNER AND I LIKE WHEN CORNERS ARE LOOK ALL LIKE WE'VE PLANNED IT OUT AND WE HAVE
h28nu6dOPEw_9 0 THERE WE GO AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THE ONE AT THE BOTTOM AND WHILE I PUT THIS ON WE'LL START GETTING READY FOR OUR NEXT PROJECT
h28nu6dOPEw_10 0 WE'VE EMBELLISHING THE RIBBON
h28nu6dOPEw_11 0 IT'S STARTING TO LOOK GOOD ALREADY I LIKE IT
h28nu6dOPEw_12 0 STAY TUNED WE'LL BE COMING UP WITH THE NEXT EMBELLISHING IN A SECOND
GnA7s3KLZSg_1 0 HI I'M AARON GREGORY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GnA7s3KLZSg_2 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR CAR BATTERY DIES HOW TO SELECT A NEW BATTERY AND HOW TO SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS
GnA7s3KLZSg_3 0 NOW THAT WE HAVE THE BATTERY OUT OF THE CAR
GnA7s3KLZSg_4 0 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE BATTERY TRAY HERE AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY SERVICING THAT WE NEED TO DO
GnA7s3KLZSg_5 0 THERE'S A PLASTIC GUARD THAT KEEPS SOME OF THE BATTERY ACID OFF OF THE METAL TRAY
GnA7s3KLZSg_6 0 SO LET'S PULL IT OUT AND SEE WHAT THE METAL TRAY LOOKS LIKE AFTER TWENTY YEARS OF HAVING THIS BATTERY CLOSE TO IT
GnA7s3KLZSg_7 0 IT'S PRETTY RUSTY AND ANY PAINT HAS VANISHED LONG AGO
GnA7s3KLZSg_8 0 YOU CAN CLEAN THESE COMPONENTS WITH THE BAKING SODA/WATER SOLUTION TO NEUTRALIZE THE ACID
GnA7s3KLZSg_9 0 AND THEN TREAT THE RUST MAYBE WIRE BRUSHING OFF THE LOOSE RUST AND TRY NOT TO FLUFF IT UP AND SPREAD IT AROUND IN YOUR ENGINE COMPARTMENT BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY ABRASIVE
GnA7s3KLZSg_10 0 RINSING IT DOWN WITH SOME WATER
GnA7s3KLZSg_11 0 CLEANING THIS AREA
GnA7s3KLZSg_12 0 AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S LOTS OF CRUNCHY OLD PAINT AND NASTY STUFF
GnA7s3KLZSg_13 0 FOR THIS OLD CAR WE'RE JUST GOING TO PUT THE BATTERY IN AND TRY TO GET TO OUR NEXT DESTINATION
GtLSNycwkR4_1 0 ANOTHER VARIATION OF THE MANUAL IS A MANUAL TO FRONT SIDE 180 OUT
GtLSNycwkR4_2 0 THIS IS A GREAT FIRST TRICK TO LEARN
GtLSNycwkR4_3 0 TO HAVE A TRICK OUT OF THE MANUAL
GtLSNycwkR4_4 0 YOU'LL DO JUST AS YOU DID FOR THE OLLIE MANUAL
GtLSNycwkR4_5 0 YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO OLLIE ONTO THE SURFACE THAT YOU'RE PLANNING TO DO YOUR TRICK ON
GtLSNycwkR4_6 0 YOU OLLIE ONTO THE TOP HOLD THE MANUAL POSITION AND THEN JUST BEFORE YOU GET TO THE END INSTEAD OF ROLLING STRAIGHT OFF YOU'LL GOT FRONT SIDE 180 TO FAKIE
GtLSNycwkR4_7 0 ONE WAY TO DO THIS IS TO SET UP IN THE MANUAL POSITION SO THAT YOUR BODY IS TURNED JUST BEFORE YOU 180 OUT
GtLSNycwkR4_8 0 YOU'LL WANT TO SET UP YOUR UPPER BODY TO ALMOST BE WHERE YOU WANT TO LAND IN THE TRICK
GtLSNycwkR4_9 0 YOUR MANUALING AND YOUR UPPER BODY AND YOUR SHOULDERS ARE GOING TO PREDICT THE DIRECTION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TURN
GtLSNycwkR4_10 0 JUST BEFORE YOU GET TO THE END I'D SUGGEST ABOUT SIX INCHES TO A FOOT BEFORE THE END YOU GET YOUR SHOULDERS ADJUSTED AND THEN FRONT SIDE 180 OUT AND LAND FAKIE AND ROLL AWAY
GtLSNycwkR4_11 0 SO YOU OLLIE UP YOU MANUAL AND JUST ABOUT SIX INCHES BEFORE THE END YOU ADJUST YOUR WEIGHT
GtLSNycwkR4_12 0 GET YOUR SHOULDERS IN THE POSITION THAT YOU WANT TO LAND IN AND FRONT SIDE 180 AND ROLL AWAY FAKIE
hb-wz7bamIE_1 0 DR LIOR KANE HI
hb-wz7bamIE_2 0 I'M DR KANE WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
hb-wz7bamIE_4 0 I AM ALSO THE AUTHOR OF HOW TO BECOME A PROFESSIONAL BACHELOR
hb-wz7bamIE_5 0 WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CYBER DATING PARTICULARLY HERE IN THE 21ST CENTURY
hb-wz7bamIE_6 0 LET ME TELL YOU YOUNG OR OLD ANYONE CAN DO IT AND EVERYONE IS DOING IT
hb-wz7bamIE_7 0 THERE ARE OVER SIX BILLION PEOPLE ON THIS PLANET AND IF YOU'RE SITTING HOME ALONE SHAME ON YOU
hb-wz7bamIE_8 0 WITH THE ADVENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE LOW COST OF TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW IN THE 21ST CENTURY TODAY EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET
hb-wz7bamIE_9 0 IT'S LOW COST IT'S EFFICIENT IT'S FUN AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT WITH OVER SIX BILLION PEOPLE
hb-wz7bamIE_10 0 AGAIN I STRESS YOU SHOULD NOT BE SITTING HOME ALONE
hb-wz7bamIE_11 0 WHAT DO YOU NEED
hb-wz7bamIE_13 0 A COMPUTER A HOOK UP TO AN INTERNET SUPPLIER SOME GOOD GOALS SOME FOCUS PLANS WHICH WE'LL TALK ABOUT LATER AND READY TO HIT THE INTERNET
hb-wz7bamIE_14 0 SO WHAT I WANT EVERYONE TO DO NOW IS BE FAMILIAR WITH THEIR COMPUTER GET READY TO HIT THE INTERNET HIT IT WITH STYLE AND GRACE AS THOUGH YOU'D HIT THEM ON THE STREETS AND LET ME TELL YOU SUCCESS IN THE 21ST CENTURY HAS GOTTEN GLOBAL THANKS THE ADVENT OF THE COMPUTER
ginkNlt4rgM_1 0 I GUESS I CAN'T GET THROUGH A SERIES ON CLOCK COLLECTING WITH TALKING ABOUT WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT CUCKOO CLOCKS EVEN THOUGH PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE THEM VERY MUCH
ginkNlt4rgM_2 0 AND PROBABLY THAT'S BECAUSE AS A CLOCK REPAIRER AND RESTORER THESE CAN BE NIGHTMARES TO WORK ON
ginkNlt4rgM_3 0 THEY'RE THE WORST COMBINATION OF CHEAP AND COMPLICATED WHERE YOU CAN WORK ON EM A LONG TIME AND STILL HAVE TROUBLE WITH THEM ONCE THEY'VE RUN FOR YEARS AND GOTTEN BADLY WORN INSIDE
ginkNlt4rgM_4 0 BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT THEY'RE A LOT OF FUN WHEN THE WHEN THEY'RE WORKING AND THE BIRD POPS OUT AND CUCKOOS AND YOU HEAR THE CUCKOOING SOUND AND THE GONGING
ginkNlt4rgM_5 0 THEY'RE THEY'RE FUN TO WATCH AND PARTICULARLY KIDS LIKE THEM TOO
ginkNlt4rgM_6 0 THEY'RE STILL MADE TODAY
ginkNlt4rgM_7 0 THEY'RE A PRODUCT OF THE BLACK FOREST IN GERMANY
ginkNlt4rgM_8 0 SO ANY ANY DISCUSSION OF GERMAN CLOCK MAKING CERTAINLY HAS TO INCLUDE CUCKOO CLOCKS
ginkNlt4rgM_9 0 YOU CAN READ MORE ABOUT CUCKOO CLOCKS ALSO ON MY WEB SITE AND ARTICLE MY WIFE WROTE ON THAT SUBJECT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THEM
ginkNlt4rgM_10 0 THIS GIVES YOU KIND OF AN EXAMPLE OF A OF A WHAT'S HAPPENED TO CUCKOO CLOCK MANUFACTURING
ginkNlt4rgM_11 0 THIS IS AN EARLIER ONE
ginkNlt4rgM_12 0 A LOT OF THESE ARE HAND CARVED BUT IN A MASS PRODUCED WAY
ginkNlt4rgM_13 0 SO YOU CAN SEE BIG DEAD ANIMALS AND BIRDS RABBITS HANGING OFF THE FRONT OF YOUR CLOCK WITH FANCY CARVINGS UP AND BELOW HERE
ginkNlt4rgM_14 0 SO THIS IS A RELATIVELY EARLY CUCKOO CLOCK
ginkNlt4rgM_15 0 SOME OF THIS STYLE COULD BE THREE FOUR FIVE FIVE FEET TALL
ginkNlt4rgM_16 0 SO THEY'RE MASSIVE CARVED THINGS WHICH ARE VERY IMPRESSIVE AND THOSE ARE PARTICULARLY VALUABLE
ginkNlt4rgM_17 0 BUT MANY MORE HAVE COME OVER SINCE THEN UP TO THE PRESENT DAY FROM GERMANY
ginkNlt4rgM_18 0 SO YOU HAVE ONES LIKE THIS WHERE YOU HAVE FIGURES THAT END UP SAWING UP THERE AS AS VARIOUS GERMAN FOLK TUNES PLAY AND THE BIRD POPS OUT AND WATER WHEELS TURN
ginkNlt4rgM_19 0 THEY CAN BE SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS
ginkNlt4rgM_20 0 PEOPLE STILL BRING THEM BACK AS SOUVENIRS FROM GERMANY AND ENJOY THEM FOR AWHILE
ginkNlt4rgM_21 0 BUT THEY'RE AGAIN NOT PARTICULARLY HIGH QUALITY
ginkNlt4rgM_22 0 AND I HOPE YOU DON'T BRING THEM TO ME TO FIX THEM WHEN THEY FINALLY BREAK
hawztAtYHCE_1 0 HI I'M DR SIMCHA SHAPIRO HERE WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
hawztAtYHCE_2 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT AN OSTEOPATHIC TECHNIQUE CALLED STRAIN COUNTER STRAIN
hawztAtYHCE_3 0 NOW STRAIN COUNTER STRAIN WAS DEVELOPED IN THE 70'S BY LAWRENCE JONES
hawztAtYHCE_4 0 STRAIN COUNTER STRAIN WAS DEVELOPED IN THE 70'S BY LAWRENCE JONES AND THE BASIS TO THE TECHNIQUE IS TO SHORTEN THE MUSCLE THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH IN ORDER TO RELEASE IT AND TO RESET THE PAIN MECHANISM
hawztAtYHCE_5 0 NOW IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS TECHNIQUE WORKS YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANATOMY OF THE BODY
hawztAtYHCE_6 0 THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAY WE PERCEIVE PAIN IN THE BODY
hawztAtYHCE_7 0 ONE OF THE WAYS IS THROUGH DAMAGE TO THE ANATOMY
hawztAtYHCE_8 0 ANOTHER WAY IS THROUGH STRETCH
hawztAtYHCE_9 0 IF YOU STRETCH SOMETHING TOO FAR YOUR STRETCH RECEPTOR IS GOING TO SEND BACK A MESSAGE TO THE BRAIN THAT WILL SAY HEY DON'T DO THAT IT HURTS
hawztAtYHCE_10 0 SO WHAT THIS DOES IS SOMETIMES WE'LL MAKE A QUICK MOVEMENT AND THE STRETCH RECEPTOR GETS SET TO TOO SHORT
hawztAtYHCE_11 0 SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHEN YOU'RE AT A NORMAL STRETCH ITS SENDING A MESSAGE TO THE BRAIN SAYING HEY DON'T DO THAT IT HURTS
hawztAtYHCE_12 0 AND SO WHAT WE DO IS JONES CAME UP WITH A GREAT TECHNIQUE THAT RESETS THE STRETCH RECEPTOR
hawztAtYHCE_13 0 THAT RESETS THE STRETCH RECEPTOR ON THE MUSCLE AND PUTS IT BACK AT AN APPROPRIATE SETTING AND MIRACULOUSLY THE PAIN GOES AWAY RIGHT AWAY
hawztAtYHCE_14 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO SHOW IT GO YOU RIGHT NOW
gjEy-PTnZto_1 0 ALRIGHT WELCOME BACK TO THE 40D TRAINING SERIES
gjEy-PTnZto_2 0 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REGISTERING AND CUSTOMIZING PICTURE STYLES
gjEy-PTnZto_3 0 YEAH SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO HERE IS TALK ABOUT THE USER DEFINED PICTURE STYLES
gjEy-PTnZto_4 0 WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS GO AHEAD AND MAKE SURE THAT YOUR CAMERA IS TURNED ON AND ACTIVATED BY PRESSING THE SHUTTER BUTTON ON THE FRONT OF THE CAMERA AND THEN LET'S GO AHEAD AND PUSH THE PICTURE STYLE BUTTON
gjEy-PTnZto_5 0 WE HAVE THIS MENU THAT POPS UP AGAIN WITH ALL OF YOUR PICTURE STYLES
gjEy-PTnZto_6 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS SCROLL DOWN TO USER DEFINED NUMBER ONE AND THEN PRESS INFO TO SELECT THAT PICTURE STYLE
gjEy-PTnZto_7 0 NOW AT THE TOP OF THIS USER DEFINED PICTURE STYLE WE HAVE THE OPTION TO SELECT FROM A PREDEFINED STANDARD STYLE AND THAT'S JUST GOING TO BE WHERE OUR PICTURE STYLE WILL BE BASED FROM
gjEy-PTnZto_8 0 SO WHAT I CAN DO IS GO IN HERE AND SELECT SAY PORTRAIT OR LANDSCAPE OR NEUTRAL
gjEy-PTnZto_9 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS GO AHEAD AND SELECT PORTRAIT AS MY BASE STYLE
gjEy-PTnZto_10 0 NOW THAT THAT'S SELECTED I HAVE THE OPTION TO CHANGE ANY ONE OF THESE SETTINGS THE COLOR TONE SATURATION CONTRAST OR SHARPNESS
gjEy-PTnZto_11 0 FOR THIS PICTURE STYLE I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND CHANGE THE COLOR TONE
gjEy-PTnZto_12 0 MOVE IT UP A COUPLE STOPS AND THEN HIT THE SET BUTTON AND THAT HAS CHANGED MY COLOR TONE AND THIS IS NOW A CUSTOMIZED USER DEFINED PICTURE STYLE
gjEy-PTnZto_13 0 NOW TO SAVE THIS STYLE WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS PRESS THE MENU BUTTON ON THE TOP LEFT SIDE OF THE CAMERA AND THAT USER DEFINED NUMBER ONE SETTING YOU CAN SEE HAS BEEN BASED OFF THE PORTRAIT PICTURE STYLE BUT HAS BEEN CUSTOMIZED AND SAVED
gjEy-PTnZto_14 0 SO NOW IF I WANTED TO I COULD SCROLL ALL THE WAY BACK UP HERE TO THE PORTRAIT STYLE AND ALL THOSE SETTINGS WILL HAVE REMAINED THE SAME FROM THE LAST TIME THAT I CHANGED THOSE BUT I HAVE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PICTURE STYLE BASED OFF THE PORTRAIT STYLE THAT IS GOING TO BE SAVED TO OUR USER DEFINED NUMBER ONE
gjEy-PTnZto_15 0 WHAT I CAN DO IS SET UP A COUPLE OF OTHER PICTURE STYLES HERE SEPARATE FROM THE DEFAULT PICTURE STYLES GIVING ME AN OPTION TO SELECT A TOTAL OF NINE PICTURE STYLES
gjEy-PTnZto_16 0 WHICH IS GREAT IT GIVES YOU A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY AND THE ABILITY TO CHANGE VERY QUICKLY
GMerrbORnbk_1 0 NEXT I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT IS CALLED THE NOLLIE FRONTSIDE 180
GMerrbORnbk_2 0 REMEMBER NOLLIE IS WHEN YOU ARE RIDING IN A SWITCH POSITION BUT FAKIE WHICH MEANS PRETTY MUCH RIDING BACKWARDS SO IT IS GOING TO BE YOUR OPPOSITE FEET ON THIS ONE SO IT IS GOING TO FEEL DIFFICULT AT FIRST BUT YOU KNOW EVENTUALLY YOU WILL BECOME A LITTLE BIT AMBIDEXTROUS AND IT WON'T FEEL SO WEIRD BUT AT THE TIME TO DO THIS YOU WANT TO HAVE THE NOLLIE PRETTY MUCH DOWN PAT BECAUSE IT IS THE FOUNDATION TO THE WHOLE TRICK
GMerrbORnbk_3 0 GET A LITTLE BIT OF SPEED AND STOMP ON THE NOSE AND AS YOU STOMP SPIN YOUR BODY IN THE DIRECTION THAT YOU WANT TO TURN AND ON THIS THE NOLLIE FRONTSIDE 180 IS THE SPIN WHERE YOU CAN SEE WHERE YOU ARE TURNING THUS MAKING IT THE EASIER OF THE TWO BUT WHEN YOU INCORPORATE THE PUSHING AND RIDING AROUND AND ALL THE OTHER PARTS OF THE NOLLIE 180 AND YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS
GsSfnOB1Krw_2 0 POYE PROFESSIONAL JEWELER AND GEMOLOGIST AND I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GsSfnOB1Krw_3 0 ALRIGHT NEXT STEP
GsSfnOB1Krw_4 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS GOING TO BE REMOVING METAL AWAY FROM THE MAIN PIECE
GsSfnOB1Krw_5 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO BE DOING IS I WILL OPEN UP THE SAW ITSELF THE BLADE ITSELF AND REMOVE IT FROM ONE END THE BASE END AND THAT WILL BE FED INTO A HOLE AND THEN I WILL PLACE IT BACK INTO THE HOLDER AGAIN THE SAW BLADE AND THEN TIGHTEN IT UP
GsSfnOB1Krw_6 0 THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN REMOVE THESE SMALL PIECES OUT OF HERE THAT'S WHY WE HAD TO MAKE THE HOLE IN THERE FIRST IS TO PUT THE SAW BLADE IN REMOVE IT FROM THE SAW PUT THE SAW BLADE IN AND THEN CUT AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO RIGHT NOW
GsSfnOB1Krw_7 0 I UNDID THE BASE OF THE SAW BLADE
GsSfnOB1Krw_8 0 WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE LARGER THAT WE'LL CUT OUT
GsSfnOB1Krw_9 0 I FED IT THROUGH THE HOLE NOW I'M CRANKING DOWN ON PLACING SAW BLADE BACK INTO THE SAW AND YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A LITTLE FLEX IN BETWEEN BUT ONCE I RELEASE IT FROM MY SHOULDER IT HAS THE TAUGHTNESS TO IT AGAIN
GsSfnOB1Krw_10 0 SO I WILL PICK A LITTLE BIT OF THE BURLIFE UP AGAIN AND YOU'LL MAKE SURE THAT YOU KIND OF MOVE A LITTLE SLOWLY SO JUST GET SOME OF THE BURLIFE ONTO THE SAW BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A NICE SMOOTH SMOOTHNESS AGAIN OKAY
GsSfnOB1Krw_11 0 BASICALLY ONCE AGAIN YOU HOLD THE PIECE WITH YOUR HAND AND THEN YOU JUST MOVE ALONG THE EDGE OF WHERE THE TEMPLATE IS INSIDE WHERE YOU BASICALLY PLACED YOUR THE DRAWING ON THE TRACING PAPER
GsSfnOB1Krw_12 0 WHEN YOU GET CLOSE TO THE EDGE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL GO VERY SLOW
GsSfnOB1Krw_13 0 I ACTUALLY STARTED IT IN THE OKAY
GsSfnOB1Krw_14 0 AS WE MOVE AROUND HERE KIND OF AN AWKWARD ANGLE BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE BLADE IS TOTALLY STRAIGHT AND AS WE SLOW IT DOWN READY TO MEET WITH THE OTHER END JUST SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND THE PIECE SHOULD JUST DROP RIGHT OUT
GsSfnOB1Krw_15 0 OKAY THE FIRST HOLE HAS BEEN REMOVED AND I'LL DO THE NEXT SERIES OF FOUR RIGHT NOW AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON FROM THERE
gifS1Kv9nCQ_1 0 NEXT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO A NOLLIE FRONTSIDE 180 OFF OF A LEDGE
gifS1Kv9nCQ_2 0 THIS TYPE OF NOLLIE 180 IS THE EASIER ONE TO PERFORM SINCE YOU CAN SEE WHERE YOU'RE SPINNING
gifS1Kv9nCQ_3 0 JUST TO REVIEW NOLLIE IS WHEN YOU'RE FRONT FOOT STAYS ON THE NOSE OF THE BOARD BACK FOOT'S MIDDLE OF THE BOARD
gifS1Kv9nCQ_4 0 ALMOST LIKE THE SWITCH POSITION BUT THINK OF IT AS RIDING SWITCH IN FAKIE
gifS1Kv9nCQ_5 0 GOING TO DO THE SAME SORT OF THING AS A REGULAR NOLLIE
gifS1Kv9nCQ_6 0 STOMP ON THE TAIL BUT WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT IS YOU'RE GOING TO START YOUR PRE-SPIN TOWARDS YOUR FRONT FOOT BEFORE YOU START NOLLIEING
gifS1Kv9nCQ_7 0 AS YOU NOLLIE TURN YOUR UPPER BODY TOWARDS THE FRONT FOOT SO THE REST OF THE BOARD WILL SPIN THE 180 DEGREES
gifS1Kv9nCQ_8 0 AND ONCE YOU'VE MADE THE FULL ROTATION YOU JUST WANT TO LINE UP AS STRAIGHT AS POSSIBLE SO THAT YOU CAN LAND CLEANLY
gifS1Kv9nCQ_9 0 AND AGAIN IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS TRICK ON A LEDGE THAT YOU NEED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION TAKE OFF ROOM
gifS1Kv9nCQ_10 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO GET TOO CLOSE TO THE LEDGE BECAUSE THE CLOSER YOU GET THE MORE UNEVEN YOUR BOARD'S GOING TO TAKE OFF AND THE MORE UNEVEN YOU'RE GOING TO LAND
Gzes4WWfnec_1 0 HI WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TEA TODAY AND NOW I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT A HIGH MOUNTAIN OOLONG FROM SHAN LIN XI
Gzes4WWfnec_2 0 SHAN LIN XI IS A RELATIVELY NEW GROWING AREA IN TAIWAN
Gzes4WWfnec_3 0 THEY'VE BEEN GROWING TEA THERE FOR ABOUT FIFTY YEARS THE ELEVATION OF SHAN LIN XI IS FIVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FEET
Gzes4WWfnec_4 0 SO THAT'S AGAIN A VERY HIGH MOUNTAIN OOLONG
Gzes4WWfnec_5 0 SHAN LIN XI IS IN THE JU SHAN TOWNSHIP IN NANTOU COUNTY THIS TEA HERE IS A HAND PICKED AND HAND CRAFTED TEA AND IT IS ALSO A CHARCOAL BAKED TEA
Gzes4WWfnec_6 0 CHARCOAL BAKING IS THE TRADITIONAL BAKING METHOD THAT WILL INFUSE THE TEA WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SMOKINESS AND A LITTLE BIT OF WOOD FLAVOR THAT COMES OUT OF THE CHARCOAL
Gzes4WWfnec_7 0 HIGH MOUNTAIN TEA LIKE THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT BOLD AND OVER COMING AND BITTER IN THE INITIAL TASTE BUT THEN THE AFTER TASTE IS GOING TO BE SWEET
Gzes4WWfnec_8 0 SO THE OLD TEA DRINKERS IN TAIWAN THEY PREFER A TEA THAT IS THAT HAS THOSE CHARACTERISTICS THAT'S OFTEN BOLD AND VERY STRONG AND ALMOST A LITTLE BIT BITTER IN THE INITIAL TASTE BUT THEN THE AFTER TASTE IS SWEET AND THAT'S WHAT THEY LOOK FOR IN A HIGH MOUNTAIN TEA LIKE THIS
Gzes4WWfnec_9 0 THIS TEA IS FULL OF THE ANTIOXIDANTS KNOWN AS POLYPHEN0L OR CATCHETINS AND THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL ANTIOXIDANTS
Gzes4WWfnec_10 0 OOLONG TEA IS THE HIGHEST HAS THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF POLYPHENOL SO IT'S A VERY GOOD TEA TO DRINK FOR ONE FLAVOR AND TWO IT HAS THE ADDED HEALTH BENEFITS OF THESE ANTIOXIDANTS THIS TEA IS REALLY A CONDUIT FOR US TO TASTE THIS EARTH
Gzes4WWfnec_11 0 THE EARTH HAS THE NUTRIENTS AND THE ALL THE SUBSTANCE AND THE TEA GROWS OUT OF THAT AND THEN WE DRINK THE TEA IT'S ALMOST AS IF WE ARE TASTING THE SOIL
Gzes4WWfnec_12 0 SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SHAN LIN XI CHARCOAL BAKED OOLONG
G-UdRaymkRQ_1 0 OKAY WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS THIS SIMPLE SNAKE KIT
G-UdRaymkRQ_2 0 ANY AREA WHERE YOU'RE AT WHERE THERE'S DIAMONDBACKS OR ANY OTHER POISONOUS SNAKES OKAY WE HAVE THIS KIT
G-UdRaymkRQ_3 0 WHAT IT CONTAINS GET THIS OUT OF THE WAY AND IS WE HAVE THE ALCOHOL WIPES AND THE STING RELIEF
G-UdRaymkRQ_4 0 THESE KITS YOU CAN PICK UP AT ANY DRUGSTORE
G-UdRaymkRQ_5 0 YOU CAN ACTUALLY ONLINE YOU CAN ORDER THIS THESE
G-UdRaymkRQ_6 0 NOW THIS IS THE EXTRACTOR
G-UdRaymkRQ_7 0 THE WAY THIS IS USED PUT THIS DOWN IS IT EXTRACTS VENOM FROM ANY BITE AREA IT COMES WITH A RAZOR
G-UdRaymkRQ_8 0 SO ANY AREA THAT DOES HAVE HAIR IN IT YOU NEED TO SHAVE IT REAL QUICK
G-UdRaymkRQ_9 0 AND IT WE HAVE DIFFERENT SUCTION CUPS HERE ACCORDING TO THE SIZE OF THE BITE
G-UdRaymkRQ_10 0 YOU CAN GET BIT BY A BABY RATTLESNAKE OR AN ADULT IT'S GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT SIZE BITE
G-UdRaymkRQ_11 0 SEE THE SUCTION OKAY THE EXTRACTOR STAYS OUT AND AS YOU PUT IT DOWN ON THE BITE OKAY YOU PUSH DOWN AND IT CREATES A SUCTION
G-UdRaymkRQ_12 0 AND IT LOCKS INTO PLACE
G-UdRaymkRQ_13 0 NOW IT'S LOCKED
G-UdRaymkRQ_14 0 OKAY NOW WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS
G-UdRaymkRQ_15 0 IT HELPS TO EXTRACT THE VENOM
G-UdRaymkRQ_16 0 YOU STILL HAVE TO GO TO THE DOCTOR NO MATTER WHAT THE EMERGENCY ROOM
G-UdRaymkRQ_17 0 BUT WHAT THIS DOES IS IT GIVES YOU EXTRA TIME
G-UdRaymkRQ_18 0 CAN YOU SEE HOW MY SKIN IS STARTING TO RISE INSIDE THE CUP
G-UdRaymkRQ_19 0 SEE THAT LIKE DOME LIKE LIKE FORMATION
G-UdRaymkRQ_20 0 THAT'S THE SUCTION THAT'S THE ACTUAL VENOM THAT WILL BE SUCKED OUT OF THE WOUND
G-UdRaymkRQ_21 0 WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED GETTING ALL THAT OUT YOU WANT TO TIP IT UPSIDE DOWN BEFORE IT GOES INTO THE CUP OKAY
G-UdRaymkRQ_22 0 AND WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE GOTTEN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WHILE YOU'RE DOING THIS YOU SHOULD BE ON YOUR WAY TO TO SEE A DOCTOR UNDO IT
G-UdRaymkRQ_24 0 IT UNDOES THE SUCTION YOU CAN SEE THE RING ON MY HAND
G-UdRaymkRQ_25 0 IT HELPS TO EXTRACT A LOT OF VENOM AND YOU ALSO HAVE THEM IF YOU GET BIT BY A BABY WHICH ARE MORE POISONOUS BY THE WAY THAN ADULTS
G-UdRaymkRQ_26 0 BECAUSE THE BABY RATTLESNAKE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO CONTROL ITS VENOM SO IT WILL PROBABLY RELEASE ALL ITS VENOM INTO YOU
G-UdRaymkRQ_27 0 SAME THING YOU CAN SEE THAT
G-UdRaymkRQ_28 0 SAME SUCTION SAME PROCESS
G-UdRaymkRQ_29 0 YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE ONE OF THESE KITS ON HAND IF YOU'RE GOING OUT CAMPING IN ANY AREA THAT HAS ANY POISONOUS SNAKES

gSlUXLAZxDw_1 0 HI I'M LIZ HOOD ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND I AM GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO GIVE YOUR BABY A BATH
gSlUXLAZxDw_2 0 ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS ABOUT COMFORTABLE TEMPERATURES FOR YOUR BABY
gSlUXLAZxDw_3 0 NOW ONE THING THAT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT YOUR BATHROOM OR KITCHEN OR WHERE EVER YOU HAPPEN TO BE GIVING YOUR BABY A BATH ITSELF IS NOT VERY COLD
gSlUXLAZxDw_4 0 AS FAR AS THE WATER YOU WILL HAVE TO TEST IT ON YOURSELF ON YOUR WRIST AND ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR ELBOW JUST TO MAKE SURE IT'S NOT TOO HOT FOR A BABY'S SKIN
gSlUXLAZxDw_5 0 BABIES CAN'T REGULATE THEIR BODY TEMPERATURE AS WELL AS ADULTS SO THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND THEIR SKIN IS ULTRA SENSITIVE TO HEAT
gSlUXLAZxDw_6 0 SO RIGHT NOW I AM TESTING IT ON MY WRIST AND IT SEEMS TO BE OKAY AND HE IS VERY EXCITED ABOUT TAKING A BATH
g69H3ghzgoY_1 0 OKAY THE CHICKEN

g69H3ghzgoY_14 0 AND YOU CAN EVEN TAKE IT OUT AND PRESENT IT AND THEN TAKE IT BACK INTO THE KITCHEN AND INDIVIDUALLY CUT IT IF YOU WANT IT TO BE A LITTLE MORE ROMANTIC
g69H3ghzgoY_15 0 BUT JUST LIKE THIS IT'S ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS
g69H3ghzgoY_16 0 AND I MEAN I WOULD TAKE A LITTLE PIECE OF ROSEMARY AND SLIDE IT HERE MAYBE IN THE EDGE SO WE'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF GREEN COMING OUT
g69H3ghzgoY_17 0 IT LOOKS REALLY PRETTY
g69H3ghzgoY_18 0 WE'VE GOT THE GORGEOUS APPLES
g69H3ghzgoY_19 0 AND A NICE WAY TO CUT THIS IS TO COME DOWN THE BONE LIKE THIS ALL THE WAY DOWN AND OFF TO THE SIDE
g69H3ghzgoY_20 0 AND YOU'RE BEGINNING TO SEE WE CAN SLICE RIGHT HERE ALONG THE LEG
g69H3ghzgoY_21 0 AND WE'VE GOT SOME BREAST MEAT COMING OUT

GykGws6snH8_1 0 I'D LIKE TO GO OVER THE POTS AND UTENSILS THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TODAY
GykGws6snH8_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE NEEDING TWO SAUTÃ© PANS OR FRYING PANS
GykGws6snH8_3 0 ONE OF WHICH WE'RE GOING TO BE USING TO SAUTÃ© OUR PORK CHOP AND THE OTHER ONE WE'RE GOING TO BE USING FIRST TO COOK UP SOME ONIONS AND GARLIC AND THEN WE WILL ADD OUR CHORIZO AND THEN WE'LL ADD ALL OF OUR DRY INGREDIENTS AND OUR KETCHUP AND OUR WATER AND OUR VINEGAR AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR A BARBECUE SAUCE FROM SCRATCH
GykGws6snH8_4 0 THEN WE'RE GOING TO PUT THAT ASIDE AND LET IT COOL
GykGws6snH8_5 0 WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE MAKING SOME RICE WE'RE GOING TO TOAST OUR RICE IN HERE
GykGws6snH8_6 0 AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SOME VEGGIE STOCK IN THIS WE'RE GOING TO ADD IT TO IT AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO ADD OUR KIDNEY BEANS OR RED BEANS WHICHEVER ONE YOU WANT TO USE
GykGws6snH8_7 0 AND SOME OREGANO AND SOME SALT AND PEPPER AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT THIS LID ON IT AND LET THAT GO DOWN
GykGws6snH8_8 0 WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE USING THIS BAKING SHEET
GykGws6snH8_9 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE NOT ROASTING OUR VEGETABLES ENTIRELY TOGETHER SO WE'RE GOING TO SPLIT THEM INTO TWO DIFFERENT THINGS
GykGws6snH8_10 0 WE'RE GOING TO USE THIS CASSEROLE DISH AND BUTTER THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO TAKE A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME AND THIS ONE FOR THE ONE'S THAT WILL TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER
GykGws6snH8_11 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE MIXING OUR VEGETABLES HERE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE MAKING A SALSA VERDE AND SPINNING OUR VEGETABLES IN HERE
GykGws6snH8_12 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE USING MEASURING CUPS MEASURING SPOONS A LARGE SPOON
GykGws6snH8_13 0 WE'RE GOING TO USE THIS SPATULA TO GET OUR VEGETABLES OUT OF THE PAN A KNIFE A CUTTING BOARD AND BECAUSE WE ARE USING RAW PORK WE'RE GOING TO BE USING A PLASTIC GLOVE
H0-C2z6cNFQ_1 0 NUENDO HAS FOUR DIFFERENT MIXERS YOU CAN USE
H0-C2z6cNFQ_2 0 ALL OF THEM DO THE SAME THING
H0-C2z6cNFQ_3 0 THEY BASICALLY SHOW UP THE SAME WAY
H0-C2z6cNFQ_4 0 SO WHAT YOU DO IS HOLD ON THERE YOU GO THERE IS YOUR MIXER
H0-C2z6cNFQ_5 0 NOW WHEN YOU HAVE A CONTROL SURFACE YOUR MIXER IS GOING TO FOLLOW YOUR CONTROL SURFACE
H0-C2z6cNFQ_6 0 SO EVERY ACTIVITY THAT I DO HERE FROM PANNING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT AS YOU CAN SEE THAT RIGHT THERE THE PANNING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
H0-C2z6cNFQ_7 0 OR FROM USING THE FADER ACTIONS OR WHATEVER IT ALL ENDS UP BEING THE SAME
H0-C2z6cNFQ_8 0 THIS IS YOUR MASTER BUS THESE ARE YOU INDIVIDUAL TRACKS TRACKS ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX ALL THE WAY DOWN THERE ARE MANY TRACKS THAT YOUR CONTROL SURFACE HAS
H0-C2z6cNFQ_9 0 BUT THIS LAST SECTION THIS LAST RECTANGLE RIGHT HERE IS THIS IS WHAT IS CALLED YOUR MASTER BUS
H0-C2z6cNFQ_10 0 THAT IS ACTUALLY YOUR MASTER BUS WHICH CONTROLS EVERYTHING
H0-C2z6cNFQ_11 0 SO IF YOUR DOING A MASTER FADE OR THE WHOLE PROJECT IS UP TO LOUD OR NOT LOUD ENOUGH YOU ARE TRYING TO FADE EVERYTHING OUT AT ONE TIME YOU WOULD USE THAT FOR YOUR MASTER BUS
H0-C2z6cNFQ_12 0 AS YOU CAN SEE IT CONTROLS THE VOLUME OF EVERYTHING AS A WHOLE
gaIcDhiuiu0_1 0 BEFORE STARTING A WHITE WATER RAFTING TRIP YOU SHOULD ALWAYS ASSUME THAT YOUR GUESTS OR CREW KNOWS NOTHING AND YOU SHOULD SHARE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS WITH THEM AS POSSIBLE BEFORE YOU GET GOING
gaIcDhiuiu0_2 0 GUYS YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR HELMET IS ON NICE AND SNUG A FINGER OR TWO UNDER HERE IS GREAT MUCH MORE THAN THAT AND IT'LL JUST COME OFF YOUR HEAD AS YOU GO OVER BACKWARDS INTO THE RIVER
gaIcDhiuiu0_3 0 YOUR PFD STANDS FOR PERSONAL FLOATATION DEVICE MAKE SURE ITS ON NICE AND SNUG SO YOU'LL ABLE TO SELF RESCUE PROPERLY IF ITS ON LOOSE IT JUST FLOATS UP OVER YOUR FACE AND ITS HARD FOR US TO SEE WHO YOU ARE AND WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT YOU BACK IN THE BOAT
gaIcDhiuiu0_4 0 ITS ALSO HARD FOR YOU GUYS TO SEE WHERE WE ARE AND WHAT DIRECTION YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SWIM IN
gaIcDhiuiu0_5 0 YOUR PADDLE IS UH PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR GEAR THIS DETERMINES WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE ABLE TO KEEP YOURSELVES IN THE BOAT
gaIcDhiuiu0_6 0 PUT YOUR THUMB UNDER HERE THIS HAND OVER HERE THIS HAND ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE FOR NICE STRONG FORWARD STROKES AND NICE STRONG BACKSTROKES AND YOU GUYS WILL BE ABLE TO HELP THE RAFT GUIDE GET THE RAFT WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE GOING AND KEEP YOURSELVES BALANCED IN THE BOAT
gaIcDhiuiu0_7 0 YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE RAFT IS AN OVAL SHAPE WITH AN OUTSIDE PERIMETER TOO SIT ON THE OUTSIDE TUBE YOU TUCK YOUR FEET UNDER THE TUBE IN FRONT OF YOU BOTH FEET INSIDE THE RAFT THAT WAY YOU'RE SUPPORTED WITH YOUR FEET IN THE BOTTOM AND YOUR PADDLE EVERY TIME YOU TAKE A FORWARD STROKE YOU'RE PUSHING THE RAFT WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO AND KEEPING YOURSELVES BALANCED IN THE BOAT
gaIcDhiuiu0_8 0 EVERY TIME YOU LIFT YOUR PADDLE UP AND SCREAM YOU HAVE A TENDENCY TO FALL INTO THE RAFT OR OUT OF THE RAFT
gaIcDhiuiu0_9 0 IF YOU FALL INTO THE RAFT SINCE IT HAS AN INFLATED FLOOR YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT IT JUST CLIMB ONTO THE OUTSIDE TUBE AGAIN AND CONTINUE ON DOWN THE STREAM
gaIcDhiuiu0_10 0 IF YOU FALL OUT OF THE RAFT TODAY A FEW THINGS YOU NEED TO REMEMBER YOU LAY ON YOUR BACK YOU POINT YOUR FEET DOWNSTREAM WHICH IS THE DIRECTION THE RIVER IS GOING AND YOU LOOK FOR HELP
gaIcDhiuiu0_11 0 AND THEN YOU GUYS AS A CREW ARE GOING TO HELP EACH OTHER
gaIcDhiuiu0_12 0 IF SOMEONE IS FLOATING BY YOU YOU GRAB THEM BY THE PFD YOU LOOK THEM IN THEIR FACE SHOUT OUT I'M GOING TO SAVE YOU YOU FALL OVER BACKWARD AND THEY LAND ON TOP OF YOU
gaIcDhiuiu0_13 0 YOU GUYS CAN HIGH-FIVE EXCHANGE PHONE NUMBERS AND THEN CONTINUE ON DOWNSTREAM
gaIcDhiuiu0_14 0 IT'S PRETTY EASY IF THEY'RE SLIGHTLY OUT OF REACH IT'S THE ONLY TIME YOU CAN LET GO OF THE T-GRIP YOU OFFER THEM THE T-GRIP YOU PULL THEM TOWARD THE RAFT THEN GRAB THEM AND PULL THEM IN
gaIcDhiuiu0_15 0 YOU AS THE SWIMMER YOUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO LIE ON YOUR BACK FEET DOWNSTREAM AND LOOK FOR HELP
gaIcDhiuiu0_16 0 YOU GUYS CANNOT STAND UP IF YOU STAND UP IN THE RIVER YOU CAN AND YOU PROBABLY WILL AT SOME POINT GET A FOOT ENTRAPMENT
gaIcDhiuiu0_17 0 IT'S WHERE YOUR FOOT OR FEET GET CAUGHT IN THE RIVERBED THE WATER PILES UP ON YOUR BOTTOM BACK AND HEAD AND PUSHES YOU HEAD FIRST IN THE RIVER AND YOU STAY THERE
gaIcDhiuiu0_18 0 YOU DAY GOES FROM BEING KINDA FUN AND GOOFY WITH YOUR RAFTING GUESTS TO BEING TRAGIC OR AT LEAST COMPLICATED IT'S HARD FOR US TO HELP YOU OUT IF YOU GET FOOT ENTRAPMENT
gaIcDhiuiu0_19 0 SO ON YOUR BACK FEET DOWNSTREAM LOOKING FOR HELP YOU MAY BE ASKED TO SWIM BACK TO THE RAFT SO TURN ON YOUR FRONT AND SWIM AGGRESSIVELY BACK TO THE RAFT
gaIcDhiuiu0_20 0 THE GUYS CARRY A BAG WITH ABOUT SIXTY FEET OF ROPE IN IT ITS CALLED A THROW ROPE IF YOU'RE OUT OF THE BOAT WE MAY TOSS YOU THE ROPE PUT THE ROPE OVER YOUR SHOULDER AND WE'LL PULL YOU BACK TO THE RAFT AND YOU GUYS CAN CONTINUE ON DOWNSTREAM
gaIcDhiuiu0_21 0 UH IF THE WHISTLE BLOWS WE'D LIKE YOU TO STOP FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WE'LL DEAL WITH THAT SITUATION AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON DOWNSTREAM ONCE WE'VE TAKEN CARE OF IT
gaIcDhiuiu0_22 0 ALSO I MENTIONED HIGH SIDES AND IT WON'T HAPPEN TODAY HIGH SIDES IS WHERE A RAFT HITS A ROCK AND EITHER SIDES UP ON TOP OF THE ROCK OR STICKS THERE
gaIcDhiuiu0_23 0 YOU CAN AVOID THAT BY LISTENING TO YOUR GUIDE AND PADDLING IF YOU HIT THE ROCK ANYWAY THE GUIDE SHOUTS OUT âHIGH SIDE' IF YOU CLIMB TOWARD THE HIGH SIDE OF THE ROCK THE HIGH SIDE OF THE RAFT THEN THE WEIGHT WILL COME OFF THE LOW SIDE AND YOU CAN SPIN OFF THAT ROCK CELEBRATE A CLOSE CALL AND CONTINUE ON DOWNSTREAM
gCVDgeWcxSk_1 0 ALRIGHT THE REED HAS FIBERS
gCVDgeWcxSk_2 0 IF YOU LOOK AT ANY BAMBOO YOU SEE A LOT OF STRAIGHT LINES GOING UP AND DOWN
gCVDgeWcxSk_3 0 YOU NOTICE THE FIBERS THERE AND FIBERS ACTUALLY TRANSMIT
gCVDgeWcxSk_4 0 YOU KNOW IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
gCVDgeWcxSk_5 0 AND SO YOU GET THE HEART THAT GOES LIKE UPSIDES DOWN U
gCVDgeWcxSk_6 0 FIBERS GOES FROM THERE TO THE TIP OF THE REED
gCVDgeWcxSk_7 0 TO THE VERY TIP OF THE REED
gCVDgeWcxSk_8 0 LOT OF LINES GOING TO THE TIP
gCVDgeWcxSk_10 0 SOME LINES ARE BROKEN
gCVDgeWcxSk_11 0 SOME LINES DON'T GO TO THE TIP
gCVDgeWcxSk_13 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE PICKING GOOD REEDS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOLID LINES UNBROKEN LINES GOING FROM THE HEART TO THE TIP
gCVDgeWcxSk_14 0 FROM THE HEART TO THE TIP
gCVDgeWcxSk_15 0 FROM THE HEART TO THE TIP
gCVDgeWcxSk_16 0 IF THEY'RE FADED BROKEN OR YOU CAN'T SEE THEM OR THEY'RE CLOUDY I WOULD NOT PICK THE REEDS
gCVDgeWcxSk_17 0 THIS IS WHY MY STUDENTS KNOW HOW TO PICK REEDS WHEN THEY GO IN TO THE MUSIC STORES AND THEY PICK GOOD REEDS
gCVDgeWcxSk_18 0 MOST REEDS IN A BOX ARE NOT GOOD
gCVDgeWcxSk_19 0 AGAIN MOST REEDS ARE NOT GOOD
gCVDgeWcxSk_20 0 SO IN THE BEGINNING WHEN YOU ARE BUYING A BOX OF REEDS AS A BEGINNER IT'S OKAY BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
gCVDgeWcxSk_21 0 BUT AS YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW TO PICK GOOD REEDS YOU PICK THEM ONE AT A TIME
gCVDgeWcxSk_22 0 AND THAT'S HOW YOU DETERMINE A GOOD REED FROM A BAD REED THE FIBERS ARE GOING ALL THE WAY TO THE TIP OR NOT
gCVDgeWcxSk_23 0 AGAIN SOLID FROM THE HEART TO THE TIP
gCVDgeWcxSk_24 0 HEART TO THE TIP
gCVDgeWcxSk_25 0 ALL THE WAY ACROSS EVENLY
gCVDgeWcxSk_26 0 THERE'S A WAY TO WORK ON A REED BUT THAT'S AN ADVANCE STEP
gCVDgeWcxSk_27 0 WE'RE NOT DOING THAT RIGHT NOW
gCVDgeWcxSk_28 0 THAT MIGHT BE LATER ON
gCVDgeWcxSk_29 0 BUT THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW HOW TO GET A GOOD REED FROM THE START WHEN YOU GET IT FROM THE STORE
HbnZrpzIM28_1 0 THIS EXERCISE IS CALLED ROLL OVER AND IT IS AN EXCELLENT BACK STRETCH

g7GdhltqUAY_18 0 I MEAN YOU COULD DRAW JUST A NAME IN ONE COLOR DROP SHADOW IT
g7GdhltqUAY_19 0 I KNOW I'M DOING THIS FAST AND IT LOOKS KIND OF SLOPPY
g7GdhltqUAY_20 0 PUT A BIG STAR BURST EVERYTHING JUST ONE COLOR
g7GdhltqUAY_21 0 AND JUST HAVE FUN
HF2toZzD37U_1 0 HI I AM KEITH FITZPATRICK THIS IS EASY TO LEARN HIP HOP AND WE ARE GOING TO GO OVER MELTING
HF2toZzD37U_2 0 MELTING IS KIND OF A WAY TO SMOOTH THE TRANSITION FROM ONE POSITION TO ANOTHER SO LET US JUST SAY IF WE STARTED IN OUR PIECE AND WE ARE UP HERE AND WE ARE SUPPOSED TO GO TO THIS POSITION
HF2toZzD37U_3 0 INSTEAD OF JUST GOING AND DROPPING DOWN WITH A MELT YOU WOULD WANT TO JUST LET EVERYTHING GO REALLY SLOWLY AND CONTROL YOUR BODY AND GET TO THAT POINT REALLY SLOWLY
HF2toZzD37U_4 0 SAME WAY WITH THE OTHER WAY YOU JUST WANT TO LET YOUR MUSCLES KIND OF RELAX AND THEN STOP AT THE END
HF2toZzD37U_5 0 SO A LOT OF TIMES YOU WILL HEAR PEOPLE ASK THE CHOREOGRAPHER ARE WE MELTING OR ARE WE JUST HITTING THAT
HF2toZzD37U_6 0 THEY WILL SAY NO YOU ARE MELTING
HF2toZzD37U_7 0 SO THAT MEANS INSTEAD OF JUST GOING BOOM AND STOPPING YOU WANT TO LET YOUR BODY ROLL REAL SLOW BOOM AND THEN COME TO COMPLETE STOP
HF2toZzD37U_8 0 OR THIS WAY REAL SLOW BOOM AND STOP NO MATTER WHICH WAY YOU GO YOU WANT IT TO BE A REAL SMOOTH TRANSITION FROM BEING UP TO DOWN BECAUSE THINGS DO NOT MELT UP SO IT USUALLY GOES DOWN
HF2toZzD37U_9 0 SO WHEN YOU FALL LET YOUR BODY BOOM AND STOP OR MELT THAT WAY BOOM OR MELT ANYWAY YOU GO BOOM
HF2toZzD37U_10 0 YOU WANT IT TO JUST BE A REALLY SLOW TRANSITION FROM AN UP PART TO A DOWN POSITION BOOM
HF2toZzD37U_11 0 THAT IS ALWAYS A STOP BOOM
HF2toZzD37U_12 0 ALRIGHT SO JUST GO FROM HERE TO HERE OR FROM UP TO DOWN MAKE SURE YOU GET THERE REALLY SLOWLY WITH THE TIME YOU HAVE ALLOTED FOR THE CHOREOGRAPHY BOOM ALRIGHT AND THAT IS YOUR MELT
HcYgjwSg64M_2 0 MY NAME'S BOB LINDE AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THE NEXT MOVE IN THE 24 YANG STYLE TAI CHI SET
HcYgjwSg64M_3 0 I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN PRACTICING TAI CHI FOR ABOUT THIRTEEN YEARS NOW
HcYgjwSg64M_4 0 SO WE JUST FINISHED OUR FIRST SINGLE WHIP AND WE FINISHED WITH THE SINGLE WHIP AND WE'RE GETTING READY TO DO THREE CLOUD HANDS
HcYgjwSg64M_5 0 SO WE DO THIS THREE TIMES
HcYgjwSg64M_6 0 AND INSTEAD I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW YOU A COUPLE AND KIND OF TREAD WATER HERE AND STAY IN ONE PLACE
HcYgjwSg64M_7 0 SO WE DROP OUR HANDS AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS FOLLOW THE UPPER HAND WITH OUR EYES AND ACTUALLY TURN OUR HEAD IN THE SAME DIRECTION
HcYgjwSg64M_8 0 AND ON THIS ONE I'M NOT GOING TO ACTUALLY SHOW YOU THE MARTIAL APPLICATIONS
HcYgjwSg64M_9 0 MAINLY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE SPACE TO DO IT
HcYgjwSg64M_10 0 AND I WOULD BE THROWING SOMEBODY AROUND WITH MY HANDS OR ACTUALLY I COULD BE JUST SLAPPING THEM AROUND AS WELL
HcYgjwSg64M_11 0 SO WHEN WE'RE DONE DOING THREE OF THOSE WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO ONE MORE SINGLE WHIP TO END THE MOVE
HcYgjwSg64M_12 0 AND THAT IS WAVE HANDS LIKE CLOUDS
HcYgjwSg64M_13 0 WE'VE ALL SEEN THAT IN THE CELEBREX COMMERCIALS OFTEN TIMES
HcYgjwSg64M_14 0 IT'S ONE OF THE MOST RELAXING AND MEDITATIVE MOVES THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE IN THE TAI CHI SET AND ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVORITES
HcYgjwSg64M_15 0 SO MAKE SURE YOU FIND A GOOD TAI CHI INSTRUCTOR IN YOUR AREA SO THEY CAN TEACH YOU CLOUD HANDS SO THAT YOU CAN MEDITATE WHILST WAVING YOUR HANDS LIKE CLOUDS AND ENJOY PLAYING TAI CHI
GRPNg6YibgI_1 0 YOU KNOW THERE IS A SPECIAL RULE A HOUSE RULE IT COULD BE CONSIDERED THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE RULE OF FIVE-CARD DRAW AND I WANT TO BE SURE TO MENTION IT
GRPNg6YibgI_2 0 IT'S THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ACE TO BE ABLE TO DRAW FOUR
GRPNg6YibgI_3 0 NOW FRANKLY IN OUR IN MY DEMONSTRATION HERE I DIDN'T INCLUDE THAT RULE AND IT'S FOR A SIMPLE FACT
GRPNg6YibgI_4 0 THE RULE SHOULD REALLY ONLY BE IN PLACE IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE AT THE TABLE OR ENOUGH LOOSE PLAYERS AT THE TABLE THAT YOU NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THE DECK RUNNING OUT BEFORE EVERYBODY CAN DRAW CARDS
GRPNg6YibgI_5 0 THE FACT IS THIS IS A FOUR PERSON GAME WE CAN'T RUN OUT OF CARDS BECAUSE IT'S FIVE TO EACH FOR THE DEAL THAT'S TWENTY CARDS AND THEN A MAXIMUM OF FOUR EACH FOR THE DRAW THAT'S THIRTY-SIX
GRPNg6YibgI_6 0 THEREFORE NO SPECIAL RULE
GRPNg6YibgI_7 0 BUT MOST OF THE TIME LIKE IN A LARGE GAME SOMEONE'S HOME GAME THERE'LL BE A RULE THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ACE TO BE ABLE TO THROW AWAY FOUR CARDS AND DRAW FOUR MORE
GRPNg6YibgI_8 0 SO JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND BUT WE'RE NOT PLAYING THAT WAY FOR OUR EXAMPLES TODAY
GTl0oP0_eBs_1 0 WELCOME BACK TO EXPERT VILLAGE
GTl0oP0_eBs_2 0 I'M SHERRY AND TALKING ABOUT TOUR DIRECTING AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO MEET MY STUDENT DONNA
GTl0oP0_eBs_3 0 DONNA WHY DON'T YOU TELL THEM A LITTLE ABOUT YOURSELF
GTl0oP0_eBs_4 0 HELLO I LOVE WORKING WITH PEOPLE AND TRAVEL
GTl0oP0_eBs_5 0 WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TOUR GUIDE A TRAVEL AGENT AND A TOUR DIRECTOR
GTl0oP0_eBs_6 0 THERE IS ALWAYS CONFUSION ABOUT THE TOUR DIRECTOR
GTl0oP0_eBs_7 0 PEOPLE WILL THINK I AM A TRAVEL AGENT
GTl0oP0_eBs_8 0 THEY WILL THINK I AM A TOUR GUIDE BUT I AM A TOUR DIRECTOR
GTl0oP0_eBs_9 0 WE ARE ALSO CALLED TOUR MANAGERS
GTl0oP0_eBs_10 0 IN EUROPE THEY CALL US COURIERS TOUR ESCORT ADVENTURE GUIDE LOTS OF DIFFERENT TERMS BUT WHAT WE ARE NOT WE ARE NOT A TRAVEL AGENT AND I AM NOT A TOUR GUIDE
GTl0oP0_eBs_11 0 AS A TOUR DIRECTOR MY JOB IS TO TRAVEL WITH THE TOUR GROUP AND MANAGE THE TOUR GROUP
GTl0oP0_eBs_12 0 I LIKE TO SAY MY JOB IS TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE GET EVERYTHING IN THE BROCHURE AND MORE WHICH SOUNDS EASY BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF CHALLENGES ALONG THE WAY THAT I WILL TALK ABOUT LATER
GTl0oP0_eBs_13 0 A TRAVEL AGENT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE OF COURSE FAMILIAR WITH TRAVEL AGENTS THEY ARE THE ONES THAT SELL THE TOURS
GTl0oP0_eBs_14 0 IF YOU GO IN TO A TRAVEL AGENCY AND YOU SEE THE BROCHURES ON THE WALL TOURS TO AUSTRALIA CHINA EUROPE SOUTH AMERICA AND YOU PICK A BROCHURE AND YOU SAY THIS IS THE TOUR I WANT TO DO THE TRAVEL AGENT WILL SELL YOU THE TOUR
GTl0oP0_eBs_15 0 THE BROCHURE IS PUT TOGETHER BY THE TOUR OPERATOR AND THAT IS WHO I WORK FOR AS A TOUR DIRECTOR
GTl0oP0_eBs_16 0 I DON'T SELL THE TOURS
GTl0oP0_eBs_17 0 IN FACT IN MOST CASES I'VE NEVER BEEN IN THE OFFICES OF THE TOUR OPERATORS
GTl0oP0_eBs_18 0 MY JOB AS THE TOUR DIRECTOR IS TO TRAVEL WITH THE TOUR GROUPS
GTl0oP0_eBs_19 0 SO IF THE TOUR STARTS IN LOS ANGELES AND WE ARE DOING AUSTRALIA I MEET THE GROUPS AT LAX AIRPORT AND FLY WITH THEM TO AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND AND FIJI AND I FLY BACK 21 DAYS LATER
GTl0oP0_eBs_20 0 THAT IS MY JOB
GTl0oP0_eBs_21 0 THE OTHER PERSON YOU ASKED FOR THE TOUR GUIDE PEOPLE THINK I AM A TOUR GUIDE
GTl0oP0_eBs_22 0 THE TOUR GUIDE IS THE PERSON THAT DOES THE NARRATION
GTl0oP0_eBs_23 0 AS A TOUR DIRECTOR ON AN INTERNATIONAL TOUR MY JOB ISN'T TO DO THE NARRATION
GTl0oP0_eBs_24 0 MY JOB IS TO MANAGE THE TOUR AND I CAN MANAGE TOURS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD BECAUSE I HAVE LOCAL GUIDES THAT WILL DO THE NARRATION
GTl0oP0_eBs_25 0 DOES THAT HELP
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_1 0 OK NOW HAVE YOUR LINE RUNS DOWN
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND GET READY TO SEW IT
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_3 0 AND THE COLOR OF THE THREAD WON'T SHOW OTHER THAN IN THE SAME SEW
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_4 0 GENERALLY YOU WANT TO USE SOMETHING THAT KIND OF BLENDS IN
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_5 0 BUT SINCE I'M SHOWING YOU GUYS I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND USE SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T BLEND IN
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_6 0 YOU WANT TO LEAVE AT LEAST A HALF INCH IN BETWEEN THE LINE AND WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO SEW
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_7 0 SO WHAT I USUALLY DO IS USE THE END OF THE PRESSER FOOT
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_8 0 I SET THAT JUST RIGHT NEXT TO THE LINE NOT ON THE LINE BUT NEXT TO IT
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_9 0 AND YOU WANT TO DRAW A REAL STRAIGHT LINE BEING VERY CAREFUL NOT TO GO IN TOWARDS THE LINE AT ALL
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_10 0 GO ALL THE WAY DOWN
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_11 0 GET TO THE OTHER END
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_12 0 MAKE SURE IT'S STILL LAYING ALL NICE AND FLAT
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_13 0 WE'RE GOING TO DO THE EXACT SAME THING
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_14 0 IT'S ACTUALLY A TRICK I LEARNED OUT OF A BOOK
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_15 0 AND I THOUGHT IT WAS THE NEATEST THING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE TRIANGLE PATTERNS WITHOUT SEWING ONE TRIANGLE TOGETHER BY MAKING ALL SQUARES
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_16 0 OK AND WE'RE YOU'RE DONE THAT'S WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE
h60rjRm21Qo_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS NATALIA PARUZ ALSO KNOWN AS THE SAW LADY
h60rjRm21Qo_2 0 YOU CAN FIND ME IN NEW YORK CITY AND TODAY I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO PLAY A SAW
h60rjRm21Qo_3 0 THE SAW IS MOST KNOWN FOR IT'S VIBRATO
h60rjRm21Qo_4 0 THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO PRODUCE THE VIBRATO
h60rjRm21Qo_5 0 ONE IS BY USING YOUR RIGHT KNEE IF YOU'RE RIGHT HANDED
h60rjRm21Qo_6 0 I'M GOING TO STRIKE THE BLADE AND THEN WOBBLE MY KNEE AND THAT WILL CREATE THE VIBRATO
h60rjRm21Qo_7 0 ANOTHER WAY IS TO USE YOUR LEFT HAND
h60rjRm21Qo_8 0 I'M GOING TO STRIKE THE BLADE AND THEN CREATE THE VIBRATO BY WOBBLING MY LEFT HAND
h60rjRm21Qo_9 0 BASICALLY THE EFFECT THAT IS ACHIEVED IS THE SAME
h60rjRm21Qo_10 0 IT'S UP TO YOU TO CHOOSE WHICH ONE WORKS BETTER FOR YOU
G86HPMAQnTg_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A HARMONIZED CHORD PLAYED OVER A BASIC DRUM BEAT
G86HPMAQnTg_2 0 AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO HERE IS START AN A EXCEPT A RIGHT HERE WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS A SIXTH FRET ON THE A G AND THE FIFTH FRET ON THE A AND PLAY B OPEN RIGHT THAT AND I'M GOING TO GO THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO PLAY AND BROKEN DOWN WHAT I'M DOING IS SIX FIVE ON THE G AND THE HIGH E WITH THE OPEN B
G86HPMAQnTg_3 0 SEVEN AND SEVEN ON THE G AND THE E AND SLIDING UP TO THE NINE BACK TO SEVEN AND BACK TO THE SIXTH AND THE FIFTH FRET AND THE WHOLE TIME AND JUST BASED TO THE FINGER STYLE PATTERN WILL BE JUST A PINCH AND THEN USING MY MIDDLE FINGER FOR THE OPEN B THE ENTIRE TIME OK
G86HPMAQnTg_4 0 AND WITH THE DRUMS IT'LL SOUND LIKE THIS
G86HPMAQnTg_5 0 SO WHAT YOU'RE USING THERE IS A HARMONIZED CHORD PLAYED OVER A SIMPLE DRUM BEAT WITH THE OPEN STRING AND HAVING IT CREATE A NICE LITTLE PRETTY EITHER LICK OR COULD BE PRETTY MUCH USED WITHIN ANYTHING WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A SONG
Gc-QWcSyGAA_1 0 IN THIS SECTION I'M GOING TO COVER ON FREESTYLE SWIMMING IS STEP NINE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_2 0 I JUST COVERED YOUR BREATHING WHICH I HOPE YOU GOT
Gc-QWcSyGAA_3 0 REMEMBER SO THE BREATHING AGAIN IS GOING TO BE JUST A NICE SLIGHT LITTLE TURN
Gc-QWcSyGAA_4 0 SO IF YOU TOOK YOUR HEAD AND JUST SLIGHTLY TURNED IT JUST ONE WAY BREATHE PUT IT BACK IT BREATHE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_5 0 NEVER EVER EVER BREATHE ON THE SAME SIDE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_6 0 SO LET ME TEACH YOU SOMETHING
Gc-QWcSyGAA_7 0 IT'S CALLED A ONE COUNT A THREE COUNT A FIVE COUNT AND A SEVEN COUNT
Gc-QWcSyGAA_8 0 IF YOU NOTICE ALL THOSE NUMBERS ARE ODD
Gc-QWcSyGAA_9 0 THE REASON WHY THEY'RE ODD IS IF YOU DO IT ON AN EVEN COUNT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUOUSLY BREATHE ON THE SAME SIDE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_10 0 SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU
Gc-QWcSyGAA_11 0 YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE WILL STRAIN THEIR NECKS BECAUSE THEY'RE SWIMMING AND YOU BREATHE ON ONE SIDE SWIM BREATHE ON THE SAME SIDE SWIM BREATHE ON THE SAME SIDE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_12 0 WELL IF YOU NOTICE IT'S AN EVEN COUNT
Gc-QWcSyGAA_13 0 SO YOU'RE GOING ONE TWO BREATHE ONE TWO BREATHE ONE TWO BREATHE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_14 0 NOW MAKE IT ODD
Gc-QWcSyGAA_15 0 ONE TWO THREE BREATHE THIS ARM'S GOING ONE TWO THREE NOW YOU'RE BREATHING ON THE OTHER SIDE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_16 0 SO YOU ALWAYS COUNT EITHER ONE THREE FIVE OR SEVEN IN YOUR HEAD WHATEVER YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH BECAUSE EVERYONE'S LUNGS WORK DIFFERENTLY AND YOU'VE GOT TO BUILD UP TOWARDS IT
Gc-QWcSyGAA_17 0 SO MOST TYPICALLY YOU'RE TAUGHT TO DO EVERY THREE STROKES
Gc-QWcSyGAA_18 0 EVERY THREE BREATHS EVERY THREE STROKES YOU TAKE A BREATH
Gc-QWcSyGAA_19 0 SO LET ME SHOW YOU
Gc-QWcSyGAA_20 0 ONE TWO THREE BREATHE THIS ARM GOES ONE TWO THREE BREATHE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_21 0 AND IF YOU REMEMBER I'M BREATHING AS I'M PULLING
Gc-QWcSyGAA_22 0 THAT'S WHEN I TAKE MY BREATH
Gc-QWcSyGAA_23 0 NOT AS I'M GOING ON THREE TRYING TO BREATHE BECAUSE MY ARM IS BLOCKING
Gc-QWcSyGAA_24 0 SO IT'S KIND OF COMMON SENSE REALLY WHEN YOU'RE LEARNING HOW TO SWIM
Gc-QWcSyGAA_25 0 SO JUST REMEMBER WHICHEVER ARM YOU START TO BEGIN YOUR PULL THAT IS THE SIDE THAT YOU WANT TO BREATHE ON
Gc-QWcSyGAA_26 0 AND THEN IN YOUR HEAD YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO COUNT
Gc-QWcSyGAA_27 0 SO REALLY IF YOU WANT TO LEARN IT THE BEST TRY TO DO IT OUT OF THE WATER FIRST AND COUNT IN YOUR HEAD
Gc-QWcSyGAA_28 0 SO COUNT ONE TWO THREE BREATHE ONE TWO THREE BREATHE ONE TWO THREE BREATHE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_29 0 AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I DO OUTSIDE OF THE WATER WITH PEOPLE ALL THE TIME
Gc-QWcSyGAA_30 0 THEN WE GO INTO THE WATER WE TRY IT AND IF I NOTICE THAT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO DO IT THEN WE'LL GET BACK OUT OF THE WATER AND DO IT AGAIN
Gc-QWcSyGAA_31 0 BECAUSE THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE HARDER THINGS TO LEARN IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT BECAUSE IT'S ALL LIKE YOU'VE GOT TO COUNT IN YOUR HEAD
Gc-QWcSyGAA_32 0 AND YOUR ARMS DON'T EVER THINK THAT BECAUSE THIS IS ONE THE NEXT TIME IT'S ONE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_33 0 THEY JUST SWITCH
Gc-QWcSyGAA_34 0 SO THE WAY I EXPLAIN THIS TO PEOPLE IS DON'T EVER TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHICH HAND IS WHAT NUMBER
Gc-QWcSyGAA_35 0 JUST COUNT IN YOUR HEAD AND JUST MOVE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_36 0 SO ANY ARM COULD BE ONE TWO THREE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_37 0 WHICHEVER ONE YOU START OFF WITH
Gc-QWcSyGAA_38 0 SO REMEMBER IT'S A ONE THREE FIVE SEVEN COUNT FOR FREESTYLE SWIMMING
Gc-QWcSyGAA_39 0 ALL RIGHT IN THIS SECTION OF FREESTYLE THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF STEP NINE AND SO NOW THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO BREATHE YOU WANT TO DO IT ON DIFFERENT COUNTS
Gc-QWcSyGAA_40 0 SO YOU'LL DO IT ON A ONE COUNT BUT TYPICALLY YOU'LL DO IT ON A THREE COUNT A FIVE COUNT OR A SEVEN COUNT
Gc-QWcSyGAA_41 0 SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU GO ONE TWO THREE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_42 0 AS THIS WHICHEVER ARM IT MAY BE THAT'S THREE AS IT'S MOVING BACK PULLING YOU WANT TO BREATHE TO ONE SIDE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_43 0 TAKE A BREATH
Gc-QWcSyGAA_44 0 THEN ONE TWO THREE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_45 0 AS THAT ARM IS MOVING BACK YOU'LL BREATHE TO THAT SIDE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_46 0 TAKE A BREATH PUT YOUR HEAD BACK IN THE WATER
Gc-QWcSyGAA_47 0 TWO THREE BREATHE ON THAT SIDE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_48 0 SO FOR EVERY THREE STROKES YOU'LL END UP TAKING A BREATH
gVJ43IgwhT4_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS BILL BASSETT AND I AM HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT HOW TO PLAY THE PEDAL STEEL GUITAR
gVJ43IgwhT4_2 0 NOW YOU CAN BASICALLY PLUG A PEDAL STEEL GUITAR INTO ANY GUITAR AMPLIFIER BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE BETTER SUITED TO THE TONE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PEDAL STEEL
gVJ43IgwhT4_3 0 I THINK THE PHILOSOPHY ON MOST STEEL PLAYERS IS THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE A LOT OF VERY CLEAN POWER AND IF YOU ARE GOING TO MURK IT UP WITH AFFECTS AND DISTORTION AND WHAT NOT YOU WANT TO HAVE CONTROL OVER THAT
gVJ43IgwhT4_4 0 I KNOW THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE PURIST WHO LIKE TO PLAY THROUGH AMPLIFIERS WITH TUBES
gVJ43IgwhT4_5 0 STEEL PLAYERS IN FINE ARTS LIKE TO PLAY THROUGH SOLID STATE AMPLIFIERS OFTEN USING HIGH POWERED POWER AMPS AND VERY SOPHISTICATED PRE-AMP SYSTEMS TO GET THE TONE AND THE SOUND THAT THEY WANT
gVJ43IgwhT4_6 0 PB BRAND AMPS HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB ON THE MARKETING TO THE PEDAL STEEL PLAYER
gVJ43IgwhT4_7 0 THIS IS THE GUITAR AMP THAT I USE BECAUSE IT SUITS ME
gVJ43IgwhT4_8 0 I LIKE TWELVE INCH SPEAKERS
gVJ43IgwhT4_9 0 OFTEN I USE 15'S IN STEEL GUITAR AMPLIFIERS BUT IT IS A VERY HIGH POWERED AMP A NICE CLEAN POWER AMP SECTION
gVJ43IgwhT4_10 0 YOU CAN DIAL IN VARIOUS EQUALIZATION AND EVEN DISTORTION AND OF COURSE IT'S GOT THE UBIQUITOUS REVERB WITHOUT WHICH I DON'T THINK A STEEL GUITAR WOULD SOUND LIKE A STEEL GUITAR
gVJ43IgwhT4_11 0 FROM THERE YOU CAN ADD AFFECTS
gVJ43IgwhT4_12 0 YOU CAN PLUG IN ACCESSORIES AND THEN JUST DISGUISE THE LIMIT AS FAR AS THAT GOES
gVJ43IgwhT4_13 0 BUT I THINK IN GENERAL I THINK IF YOU ARE SHOPPING FOR A PEDAL STEEL AMPLIFIER YOU MIGHT TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THE TV LINE OF STEEL GUITAR AMPLIFIERS AND THEN THERE ARE SOME SPECIAL BOUTIQUE TYPES AGAIN THAT USE HIGH POWERED SOLID STATE AMPS AND VERY SOPHISTICATED PRE-AMPS TOO MODELS SHAPES AND TONES THAT STEEL GUITAR PLAYERS LIKE TO HEAR
gZpVBq3Qmn8_1 0 THE NEXT LETTER IS F AND IT'S FOR RELIGIOUS ENVIRONMENT
gZpVBq3Qmn8_2 0 AND IT IS GOING TO FOLLOW THE SAME SUIT OF EVERYTHING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SO FAR
gZpVBq3Qmn8_3 0 WE'RE DIGGING FOR CLUES ABOUT THE CHARACTER
gZpVBq3Qmn8_4 0 WHAT WAS THEIR RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND
gZpVBq3Qmn8_5 0 DID THEY COME FROM A RELIGIOUS FAMILY
gZpVBq3Qmn8_6 0 DID THEY GO TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY
gZpVBq3Qmn8_7 0 WERE THEY CONSERVATIVE
gZpVBq3Qmn8_8 0 WERE THEY BAPTIST
gZpVBq3Qmn8_9 0 WERE THEY ATHEIST
gZpVBq3Qmn8_10 0 WHAT WAS THEIR RELIGIOUS ENVIRONMENT
gZpVBq3Qmn8_11 0 NOW SEE IN MY EXAMPLE PLAY THE RELIGIOUS ENVIRONMENT IS A HUGE HUGE PORTION OF MY PLAY
gZpVBq3Qmn8_12 0 SO IN MY PLAY ANALYSIS RELIGIOUS ENVIRONMENT IS TWO PAGES LONG
gZpVBq3Qmn8_13 0 WHERE I HAVE PULLED ALL THE QUOTES ABOUT RELIGION THAT THE CHARACTER SAYS ABOUT IT THAT THE OTHER CHARACTERS SAY ABOUT IT
gZpVBq3Qmn8_14 0 MY POLITICAL SECTION HAS THREE QUOTES IN IT
gZpVBq3Qmn8_15 0 SO EVERY PLAY IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT
gZpVBq3Qmn8_16 0 FOR ME SECTION F IN MY ANALYSIS IS THE BIGGEST
gZpVBq3Qmn8_18 0 FOR YOU ONE OF YOUR OTHER SECTIONS MIGHT BE BIGGER
g7scgD54QFk_1 0 THIS IS BEN INGHAM WITH EXPERT VILLAGE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT PUTTING IN A GRAVEL ROAD
g7scgD54QFk_2 0 WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVED ON THIS PROPERTY THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ON THE PROPERTY THERE WAS NO WATER NO ELECTRICITY EXTERNAL FENCES WAS ALL THAT WERE ON THE PLACE AS FAR AS WE KNEW IT HAD NEVER BEEN USED FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT TO RAISE CATTLE
g7scgD54QFk_3 0 WE WANTED TO PUT A HOME SITE ON HERE SO WE NEEDED SOME WAY TO GET HEAVY TRUCKS AND EQUIPMENT ONTO THE LAND ON THIS VERY RED CLAY GUMBO SOIL THAT AS YOU CAN SEE IS VERY EASY TO GET STUCK IN
g7scgD54QFk_4 0 SO THE PROCESS I STARTED AT THE FENCE AND HAD A BOX BLADE ON THE BACK OF MY TRACTOR AND PULLED OUT AND TRIED TO SMOOTH OUT AS MUCH AS I COULD AND I JUST TRIED TO FOLLOW THE CONTOUR OF THE LAND
g7scgD54QFk_5 0 INSTEAD OF JUST A STRAIGHT ROAD COMING IN I JUST LIKE THE EVEN FLOW OF IT AND THEN I HAD A CONTRACTOR COME IN AND BRING ME UH TWO SEMI LOADS OF GRAVEL
HcNOnilvluw_1 0 HELLO THIS IS JACQUELINE ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
HcNOnilvluw_2 0 IN THIS CLIP WE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT TAKING DOWN CORNROWS
HcNOnilvluw_3 0 TAKING DOWN CORNROWS IS A PRETTY SELF EXPLANATORY PROCEDURE BUT IT COULD MADE EVEN MORE SIMPLE
HcNOnilvluw_4 0 JUST LIKE PUTTING THE CORNROWS FIRST IN BOTH THE SUBJECT AND THE STYLES NEED TO BE COMFORTABLE THAT COULD BE A VERY TIME CONSUMING PROCESS EQUAL TO OR MORE SO THEN PUTTING THE BRAIDS IN
HcNOnilvluw_5 0 DEPENDING ON THE SETTING YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE SEATED AS WELL
HcNOnilvluw_6 0 ONCE YOUR SUBJECT IS COMFORTABLE AND RELAXED SITTING IN FRONT OF YOU YOU COULD BEGIN BY TAKING THE RUBBER BANDS AND ACCESSORIES IF APPLICABLE
HcNOnilvluw_7 0 NEXT BEGIN AT THE END OR BOTTOM OF THE PLAT AND BEGIN UNRAVELING
HcNOnilvluw_8 0 YOU COULD DO THIS USING YOUR FINGERS
HcNOnilvluw_9 0 HOWEVER FOR SMALLER TYPES OF BRAIDS YOU MAY WANT TO USE A END OF A RATTAIL COMB AND GET IT LOOSE UNTIL IT IS COMPLETELY UPBRAIDED
HcNOnilvluw_10 0 COMB IT OUT AND PROCEED TO THE NEXT SECTION
gfWwgGQgakA_1 0 HI THIS IS RACHAEL RICHARDSON WITH NUTROLUTION IN SOUTH BEACH MIAMI FLORIDA
gfWwgGQgakA_2 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN EAT TO PREVENT BREAST CANCER
gfWwgGQgakA_3 0 NOW BREAST CANCER IS ONE OF THOSE HORMONAL DISEASES AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO PROTECT YOUR HORMONE LEVELS AND ELIMINATE EXCESS ESTROGENS THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO BREAST CANCER IS TO REDUCE YOUR SUGARS
gfWwgGQgakA_4 0 SO ACTUALLY WHEN YOU EAT SUGAR YOUR BODY SECRETES INSULIN AND WHEN YOUR BODY SECRETES INSULIN IT ALSO CHANGES YOUR ESTROGEN BALANCE ACTUALLY RAISES IT AND MAKES YOU MORE PRONE TO BREAST CANCER AND OTHER HORMONAL CANCERS
gfWwgGQgakA_5 0 SO REDUCING SUGAR SHOULD BE YOUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO PREVENT WHICH WE ALL ARE BREAST CANCER
gfWwgGQgakA_6 0 OTHER THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO ARE CONSIDER DRINKING UP TO ACTUALLY EIGHT CUPS OF GREEN TEA A DAY
gfWwgGQgakA_7 0 JAPANESE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN US THAT THIS IS THE LEVEL THAT REALLY MAKES A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON BREAST CANCER LEVELS SO GOOD WAYS TO DO THAT ARE TO MAKE A BIG POT AND TO DRINK IT COLD THROUGHOUT THE DAY OR YOU CAN EVEN GET IT FROM STARBUCKS AND GET YOUR REFILLS EVERY DAY

h81yyFA7KME_1 0 HI HOW'S IT GOING
h81yyFA7KME_2 0 MY NAME IS KEVIN BARRETT AND I'M OUT HERE IN THE BEAUTIFUL SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS
h81yyFA7KME_3 0 I'M GETTING READY TO HEAD OUT INTO THE WILDERNESS TO TEACH YOU HOW TO SURVIVE IN THE OUTDOORS
h81yyFA7KME_4 0 BUT FIRST I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEED TO PUT INTO A SURVIVAL PACK
h81yyFA7KME_5 0 SO I'M GOING TO HELP YOU BUILD THE SURVIVAL PACK RIGHT NOW
h81yyFA7KME_6 0 THE THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO INCLUDE IN IT ARE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO HELP YOU WITH FINDING AND TREATING WATER
h81yyFA7KME_7 0 I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO MAKE A HOMEMADE PURIFIER WITH A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PUT INTO YOUR SURVIVAL PACK
h81yyFA7KME_8 0 I'M ALSO GOING TO SHOW YOU ALL OF THESE LITTLE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP ON YOU INCLUDING IF I HAVE IT A KNIFE
h81yyFA7KME_9 0 AND THIS IS GOING TO BE YOUR MOST IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN A SURVIVAL PACK IS YOUR KNIFE OKAY I'M GOING TO ALSO TEACH YOU ALL DIFFERENT WAYS TO HUNT FOR FOOD WHAT KIND OF THINGS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO BRING INCLUDING ROPE AND SNARE WIRE SO THAT YOU CAN BUILD BOW AND ARROWS AND MAKE SNARES FOR GAME TRAILS
h81yyFA7KME_10 0 SO I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT THINGS TO PUT INTO A SURVIVAL PACK
h81yyFA7KME_11 0 COME ALONG WITH ME AND WE'LL GET TO IT
hGCrLx07O2M_1 0 BEGIN WITH YOUR LEGS STRETCHED OUT IN FRONT OF YOU
hGCrLx07O2M_2 0 THEN BEFORE WE GO INTO THE NEXT POSE YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT THE CURVE IN YOUR LOWER BACK
hGCrLx07O2M_3 0 IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT WHEN WE DO SEATED HIP OPENERS OR FORWARD BENDS OR TWISTS THAT WE CREATE A NATURAL CURVE IN THE LOWER BACK BEFORE WE BEND FORWARD
hGCrLx07O2M_4 0 SO IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR VERTEBRAE OR YOUR BACK ARE ROUNDING BACK BECAUSE YOU'RE HAM STRINGS ARE TIGHT YOUR ABDOMINALS ARE TIGHT THAT MEANS YOU NEED TO SIT UP ON A BLANKET OR A BLOCK UNTIL YOU CAN GET A CURVE IN YOUR LOWER BACK
hGCrLx07O2M_5 0 SO GO AHEAD AND DO THAT NOW
hGCrLx07O2M_6 0 AND THEN FROM THERE YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR LEFT HEEL BACK INTO THE GROIN
hGCrLx07O2M_7 0 THE LEFT KNEE CAN GO A LITTLE WIDER OUT TO THE SIDE PLACE YOUR FINGERTIPS OUTSIDE YOUR HIPS WITH YOUR INHALATION LENGTHEN YOUR SPINE UP TOWARDS THE SKY
hGCrLx07O2M_8 0 FROM THAT LENGTH ON YOUR EXHALATION TWIST TOWARD THE RIGHT
hGCrLx07O2M_9 0 THEN AGAIN INHALE PUSH YOUR FINGERTIPS INTO THE EARTH AND LENGTHEN YOUR SPINE WAY UP AND FEEL THAT CURVE IN YOUR LOWER BACK AND ALSO THE LOWER BELLY'S LIFTING UP
hGCrLx07O2M_10 0 WITH ONE MORE BREATH WE CAN BEGIN TO FOLD FORWARD AND USING A STRAP CAN BE REALLY HELPFUL
hGCrLx07O2M_11 0 SO YOU CAN TAKE A STRAP AROUND THE BALLS OF YOUR TOES AND FOR SOME OF US IF WE DON'T HAVE A CURVE IN THE LOW BACK WE JUST WANT TO STAY UPRIGHT AND ACTUALLY STAYING MORE UPRIGHT AND TRYING TO CREATE A CURVE WILL GIVE YOU A REALLY GOOD STRETCH
hGCrLx07O2M_12 0 OR IF YOU DO HAVE A CURVE THEN GO AHEAD AND START TO FOLD FORWARD
hGCrLx07O2M_13 0 AS YOU FOLD FORWARD YOU CAN PULL A LITTLE BIT ON THE STRAP AND STRETCH FORWARD THROUGH YOUR HEART
hGCrLx07O2M_14 0 INHALE TO LIFT BACK UP

g5v-EZbSr-w_14 0 AND SO WHAT I AM GOING TO DO JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT I GET A NICE STRAIGHT LINE I DON'T KNOW I'LL JUST USE A PIECE OF GLASS THAT I KNOW ALREADY HAS A STRAIGHT EDGE
g5v-EZbSr-w_15 0 I AM JUST GOING TO USE THAT AS A STRAIGHT EDGE BUT YOU CAN USE A RULER OR A LITTLE PIECE OF WOOD OR MAYBE A PIECE OF FOLDED UP CARDBOARD WHATEVER YOU WANT IT IS JUST A STRAIGHT EDGE
g5v-EZbSr-w_16 0 AND I AM GOING TO DRAW THAT WITH MY SHARPIE

G4m-SIDDgGs_2 0 WE'VE SOAKED OUR PLANT
G4m-SIDDgGs_3 0 JUST GOING TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF WATER IN THE BOTTOM OF THIS HOLE FIRST JUST TO HELP PREMOISTEN THE HOLE
G4m-SIDDgGs_4 0 THE NEXT THING IS TO TAKE THE PLANT OUT OF THE BUCKET AND ADJUST THE PLANT
G4m-SIDDgGs_5 0 IT'S ALL NICE AND SOAKED FOR SOIL DEPTH
G4m-SIDDgGs_6 0 I LIKE TO DIG MY HOLE A BIT BIGGER AND DEEPER SO THAT I CAN ALWAYS BACK FILL WITH A GOOD LIGHTWEIGHT MIX SO THAT IT'S EASIER FOR THE PERENNIAL TO ROOT INTO
G4m-SIDDgGs_7 0 FIRST I NEED TO JUDGE I'VE MADE THE HOLE AND WHETHER OR NOT I NEED TO BACK FILL IN THERE OR NOT
G4m-SIDDgGs_8 0 NOW THIS IS PRETTY DARN CLOSE

h9Yh2wZXOYY_1 0 THE HU CAN BE USED FOR ANXIETY
h9Yh2wZXOYY_2 0 IT IS THE PERFECT TECHNIQUE TO COMBAT ANXIETY
h9Yh2wZXOYY_3 0 WHERE DOES ANXIETY COME FROM AND WHY ARE WE ANXIOUS
h9Yh2wZXOYY_4 0 WELL ANXIETY COMES FROM NOT BEING PRESENT
h9Yh2wZXOYY_5 0 I HIT MY RUBBER BAND I SNAP IT TO KEEP ME PRESENT
h9Yh2wZXOYY_6 0 IN THE PRESENT MOMENT EVERYTHING IS GRAND
h9Yh2wZXOYY_7 0 IT'S ALWAYS GREAT IN THE PRESENT MOMENT
h9Yh2wZXOYY_8 0 HOWEVER WHEN I START TO DRIFT INTO THE PAST OR WHEN I GO INTO THE FUTURE
h9Yh2wZXOYY_9 0 OH MY GOD
h9Yh2wZXOYY_10 0 THE BILLS ARE DUE TOMORROW
h9Yh2wZXOYY_11 0 I NEED TO HAVE MY CAR IN THE SHOP TOMORROW
h9Yh2wZXOYY_12 0 THERE'S GOING TO BE TREMENDOUS TRAFFIC ON THE FREEWAY TOMORROW
h9Yh2wZXOYY_13 0 ALL THOSE THINGS MAY BE TRUE THEY MAY NOT
h9Yh2wZXOYY_14 0 HOWEVER THINKING ABOUT THEM NOW IS ABSOLUTELY USELESS IT CAUSES ME ANXIETY
h9Yh2wZXOYY_15 0 AND WHAT DO I DO ABOUT IT
h9Yh2wZXOYY_16 0 THAT'S THE BIG THING
h9Yh2wZXOYY_17 0 I DO THE HU
h9Yh2wZXOYY_18 0 THE HU KEEPS ME PRESENT IN THE MOMENT
h9Yh2wZXOYY_20 0 TO STAY PRESENT
h9Yh2wZXOYY_21 0 IT IS A GREAT ANXIETY TOOL

gUgAci-S1mM_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS KYLE BRAYER AND YOUR LAST BICEP EXERCISE WILL BE THE DROP SET
gUgAci-S1mM_2 0 DROP SET IS DESIGNED TO COMPLETELY FATIGUE THE BICEP MUSCLE
gUgAci-S1mM_3 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO START WITH A WEIGHT THAT YOU CAN PERFORM ABOUT SIX TO EIGHT REPETITIONS WITH AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO PROGRESSIVELY DROP THE WEIGHT AND CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME NUMBER OF REPETITIONS
gUgAci-S1mM_4 0 SO IT'S GOING TO BE TO FATIGUE OR FAILURE
gUgAci-S1mM_5 0 SO I'M STARTING WITH FIFTEEN POUNDS TO DEMONSTRATE
gUgAci-S1mM_6 0 SO I'LL TURN TO THE SIDE
gUgAci-S1mM_7 0 I'M GOING TO DO SIX TO EIGHT REPETITIONS
gUgAci-S1mM_8 0 SO AS I CURL THE WEIGHT UP I'M KEEPING MY ELBOWS LOCKED TO THE SIDES OF MY BODY
gUgAci-S1mM_9 0 MY PALMS ARE UP TOWARDS THE CEILING AND I'M CURLING
gUgAci-S1mM_10 0 I'M TRYING TO EXHALE ON THE WAY UP AND INHALE ON THE WAY DOWN
gUgAci-S1mM_11 0 AFTER I PERFORM MY SIX TO EIGHT REPETITIONS I'M GOING TO DROP THE WEIGHT AND WITH THESE POWER BLOCKS I'LL ADJUST THE WEIGHT FIVE POUNDS DOWN ON EITHER SIDE
gUgAci-S1mM_12 0 AND THEN I'LL CONTINUE
gUgAci-S1mM_13 0 SO AGAIN PALMS UP THE EXACT SAME MOTION
gUgAci-S1mM_14 0 STAND DUMBBELL CURL
gUgAci-S1mM_15 0 I'M CURLING THE WEIGHT
gUgAci-S1mM_16 0 AND ONCE I REACH MY SIX TO EIGHT REPETITIONS WHICH IS ABOUT THE TIME I'LL FATIGUE OR HIT FAILURE THEN I DROP THE WEIGHT BRING THE WEIGHT DOWN ANOTHER FIVE POUNDS AND CONTINUE
gUgAci-S1mM_17 0 AND FOR THE LAST SET YOU CAN DO YOUR SIX TO EIGHT REPETITIONS OR ONCE YOU GET MORE ADVANCED YOU CAN CONTINUE TO DO THESE CURLS UNTIL YOU REACH FAILURE
gUgAci-S1mM_18 0 FAILURE IS THE POINT WHEN YOU CAN NO LONGER DO A PERFECT REPETITION
gUgAci-S1mM_19 0 SO WHEN YOU START TO USE YOUR BACK OR BEND YOUR KNEES OR START TO HAVE TO TWIST YOUR ARMS OR BRING ONE UP AT A TIME
gUgAci-S1mM_21 0 SO THIS IS CALLED THE DUMBBELL DROP SET
GTHgTqpYUfY_1 0 WE HAVE JUST APPLIED THE VITAMIN C MASK ON MY ASSISTANT AND WHILE THAT IS SEEPING INTO HER PORES AND WHILE SHE IS GETTING THE MAXIMUM BENEFITS OF THE MASK WE ARE GOING TO DO A NICE SHOULDER MASSAGE FOR HER AND THIS WILL HELP HER RELAXATION BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE MAJOR ESSENTIAL BENEFITS OF GETTING A FACIAL NOT ONLY IN A VITAMIN C FACIAL BUT IN ANY FACIAL TREATMENTS THAT ANYONE OFFERS AND AGAIN WE ARE REALLY ALLOWING TIME FOR THE MASK TO ABSORB INTO MY ASSISTANT'S SKIN HAIR SO SHE CAN REALLY SEE THE BENEFITS OF THAT VITAMIN C WHICH ARE TONING LIFTING AND FIRMING THE SKIN AND ALSO BRIGHTENING THE COMPLEXION AND YOU WANT TO DO THE MASSAGE FOR A GOOD FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES A LITTLE BIT LONGER IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT EXTRA TIME AND JUST REALLY WE ARE CATERING TO HER TENSION SPOTS WHICH FOR MOST PEOPLE ARE USUALLY THE TOPS OF THE SHOULDERS HERE AND THE NECK AREA AND WHEN THE CLIENT IS RELAXED THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A BETTER EXPERIENCE FIRST OF ALL BUT STATISTICALLY THE PRODUCT IS ABSORBED BETTER TOO IF THE CLIENT IS JUST RELAXED AND OPEN TO RECEIVE TREATMENT
g8sWkQF0Dio_1 0 HI I'M KELLI AND I'M AN AESTHETICIAN AND MAKEUP ARTIST AT ULTA SALON AND COSMETICS AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT CAUSES EYE WRINKLES
g8sWkQF0Dio_2 0 ONE OF PROBABLY THE MOST PROMINENT CAUSES OF EYE WRINKLES IS JUST FROM EVERY DAY EXPRESSION SO IF YOU SMILE FOR ME YOU CAN SEE HOW ANY EXPRESSION YOU MAKE KIND OF CAUSES SOME EXPRESSION AROUND THE EYES SO IF YOU ARE NOT USING PROTECTIVE MEASURES SUCH AS SPF'S EYE CREAM SUNGLASSES ANYTHING TO PROTECT THE EYES AND BASICALLY PROTECT THE COLLAGEN ELASTIN FROM AROUND THE EYES BEING BROKEN DOWN THOSE CAN DEFINITELY LEAD TO YOUR FIRST SIGNS OF AGING
g8sWkQF0Dio_3 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE USING A REALLY GOOD TREATMENT MOISTURIZER
g8sWkQF0Dio_4 0 THE SKIN AROUND YOUR EYES IS THE THINNEST AND MOST DELICATE SKIN AROUND YOUR ENTIRE BODY AND ALSO HAS VERY LITTLE MOISTURE TO IT
g8sWkQF0Dio_5 0 THERE IS VERY LITTLE MOISTURE GLANDS AROUND THE EYE SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE HYDRATING THE EYE AREA SO YOU JUST TAKE A LITTLE BIT ON YOUR RING FINGER RING FINGER IS ALWAYS THE FINGER YOU WANT TO USE AROUND THE EYE AND JUST RUB IT VERY GENTLY IN A CLOCKWISE DIRECTION
g8sWkQF0Dio_6 0 WHEN WORKING AROUND THE EYE YOU NEVER WANT TO PULL OR TUG
g8sWkQF0Dio_7 0 THAT CAN LEAD TO COLLAGEN BREAK DOWN AND LINES AND WRINKLES AS WELL SO WHEN YOU ARE WORKING ABOVE THE EYE YOU ALWAYS WANT TO GO OUT AND WHEN YOU ARE WORKING UNDER THE EYE YOU ALWAYS WANT TO GO IN
g8sWkQF0Dio_8 0 YOU NEVER WANT TO PULL IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
g8sWkQF0Dio_9 0 THAT CAN CAUSE THE COLLAGEN ELASTIN BREAK DOWN
g8sWkQF0Dio_10 0 YOU CAN ALSO HELP TO REDUCE WRINKLES AND PREVENT WRINKLES BY NOT SLEEPING ON YOUR FACE JUST BY SCRUNCHING UP YOUR FACE EVERY NIGHT IN YOUR PILLOW CAN CAUSE COLLAGEN ELASTIN BREAKDOWN AND JUST EAT A REALLY GOOD HEALTHY DIET DRINK A LOT OF WATER AND USE A SPF
g8sWkQF0Dio_11 0 THOSE ARE SOME THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP WITH WRINKLES AROUND THE EYES
GUBUPwQ4Emk_1 0 HI I'M JAN KAIN AND CONTINUING ON WITH OUR TAI CHI LESSON WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FROM THIS POSITION FROM SINGLE WHIP INTO PLAY THE GUITAR
GUBUPwQ4Emk_2 0 AND KEEP IN MIND THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE BREAKING DOWN FOR YOU IS ACTUALLY MEANT TO BE IN A FLOW ONE RIGHT AFTER THE OTHER IN SEQUENCE
GUBUPwQ4Emk_3 0 SO YOU ARE GOING TO CAREFULLY AND SLOWLY JUST START TO TURN YOUR LEFT TOES JUST A LITTLE BIT
GUBUPwQ4Emk_4 0 SHIFT THE WEIGHT ALL THE WAY TO THE LEFT SO THAT YOU CAN PICK UP YOUR RIGHT FOOT
GUBUPwQ4Emk_5 0 AS THE RIGHT HEEL COMES TO THE FRONT YOU'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND CLOSE YOUR HANDS TOGETHER
GUBUPwQ4Emk_6 0 LEFT FINGERS INTO THE RIGHT ELBOW RIGHT ARM STRAIGHT UP
GUBUPwQ4Emk_7 0 SO AGAIN MOST OF YOUR WEIGHT IS ON THE LEFT
GUBUPwQ4Emk_8 0 AND THIS IS A MARTIAL ARTS APPLICATION
GUBUPwQ4Emk_9 0 IF SOMEONE CAME ALONG AND YOU ACTUALLY CLOSED IN ON THEM ON THEIR HANDS YOU CAN ACTUALLY PUSH THEM ACROSS THE ROOM
GUBUPwQ4Emk_10 0 SO EVEN THOUGH WE ARE WORKING ON BALANCE STRENGTH STAMINA FLEXIBILITY RELAXATION AND MEDITATION DON'T FORGET THAT TAI CHI CAN ALSO BE VERY POWERFUL
h8E6QXG-yU4_1 0 HI I'M KARL JAMES OWNER OF CREOSOUL CATERING AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M HERE TO SHOW YOU A TANGY STICKY CHICKEN WING RECIPE
h8E6QXG-yU4_2 0 OKAY LET'S LOOK AT THE INGREDIENTS WE'RE GOING TO NEED FOR THIS RECIPE
h8E6QXG-yU4_3 0 FIRST OF ALL WE'RE GOING TO HAVE CHICKEN WINGS AND THIS RECIPE IS KIND OF BROKEN UP INTO TWO SECTIONS FIRST IS THE CHICKEN THEN THERE'S THE SAUCE THEN IT ALL COMES TOGETHER
h8E6QXG-yU4_4 0 SO FOR OUR SEASONINGS WE'RE GOING TO USE A LITTLE BLACK PEPPER SOME GARLIC POWDER SOME CREO SEASONINGS ONION POWDER SOME GARLIC SALT THESE ITEMS RIGHT HERE WE'LL BASICALLY USE WITH THE CHICKEN ALONG WITH SOME FLOUR TO DREDGE THEM IN AS WELL AS A CUP OF OIL TO FRY THEM IN
h8E6QXG-yU4_5 0 AND THEN FOR THE SAUCE WE'RE GOING TO USE A LITTLE GARLIC POWDER SOME CHOPPED GARLIC A LITTLE BIT OF VINEAGAR SOME SOY SAUCE WATER SUGAR AND MIX THAT AROUND AND THEN AT THE END WE'LL SPRINKLE A FEW CHIVES ON TOP AND WE SHOULD BE READY TO GO
gUKDEgVCQN8_1 0 JASON SHERIDAN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE THIS IS JASON SHERIDAN OF SHERIDAN FENCING ACADEMY HERE IN NEW YORK CITY
gUKDEgVCQN8_2 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ADVANCED SABRE FENCING
gUKDEgVCQN8_3 0 ONE OF THE THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND IS AS YOU ARE COMING FORWARD AND YOU ARE PREPARING TO MAKE YOUR ATTACK YOU ARE NOT ACTUALLY ATTACKING AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY BE SCORED AGAINST DURING THIS TIME IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFULLY
gUKDEgVCQN8_4 0 THIS IS CALLED ATTACK IN PREPARATION
gUKDEgVCQN8_5 0 IF AS YOU'RE MOVING FORWARD AND YOUR ARM IS BACK YOUR OPPONENT HITS YOU IT WILL BE THEIR TOUCH
gUKDEgVCQN8_7 0 START A LITTLE BIT CLOSER GIRLS
gUKDEgVCQN8_8 0 IN THIS CASE EMMA BEGINS PREPARING HER ATTACK AND AS SHE DOES SHE IS HIT IN THE HEAD
gUKDEgVCQN8_9 0 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE HEAD OF COURSE BUT SHE'S HIT ANYWAY
gUKDEgVCQN8_10 0 THIS TIME RACHEL MAKES THE ATTACK RATHER THE PREPARATION AND EMMA WILL ATTACK AS SHE COMES FORWARD
gUKDEgVCQN8_11 0 LET'S TRY IT AGAIN THE GOAL TO BE HITTING BEFORE THEY BEGIN EXTENDING THEIR ARM
gUKDEgVCQN8_13 0 IT DOESN'T MATTER
gUKDEgVCQN8_15 0 AGAIN HITTING HER IN PREPARATION AS SHE IS MOVING FORWARD
HG9mwh7aAfM_1 0 OK WELL CORONAL POLISHING IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE DONE
HG9mwh7aAfM_2 0 SO WHAT IT DOES IS IT CLEANS ALL THE TARTER AND THE CALCULUS FROM THE GUM LINE OF THE TOOTH ALL THE WAY TO THE TIP OF THE TOOTH
HG9mwh7aAfM_3 0 THE GUM LINE OF THE TIP OF THE TOOTH IS CALLED THE CROWN OR THE CORONAL THUS THE NAME CORONAL POLISH
HG9mwh7aAfM_4 0 AND WHAT HAPPENS IS IS WHEN A PERSON JUST THROUGH DAY TO DAY WEAR AND TEAR OF EATING DRINKING YOU KNOW BREATHING THEY START BUILDING UP EXCESS BACTERIA AND TARTAR AND CALCULUS ON THESE TEETH THAT JUST BRUSHING AND FLOSSING ALONE WILL NOT REMOVE
HG9mwh7aAfM_5 0 SO OBVIOUSLY THE BENEFITS FOR CORONAL POLISHING IS TO REMOVE THIS AND ALSO HAVE A BETTER FOUNDATION FOR SOME SUPER DUPER HEALTHY GUMS
HG9mwh7aAfM_6 0 NOW MOST OF THE TIME A DENTIST OR A DENTAL HYGIENIST WILL DO THE CORONAL POLISHING
HG9mwh7aAfM_7 0 AND MOST PEOPLE USUALLY HAVE TO GET IT DONE ONCE EVERY SIX MONTHS SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE TO GET IT DONE MORE TIMES BECAUSE GENETICALLY THEY BUILD UP A MORE OF A BACTERIA AND THEY HAVE TO GET IT DONE EVERY THREE MONTHS OR ONE MONTH
HG9mwh7aAfM_8 0 THIS IS THE TIME YOU CAN BLAME YOUR MOTHER AND FATHER BECAUSE THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S IN YOUR GENES THAT YOU HAVE TO BUILD UP THIS TARTAR CONTROL AND EVERYTHING ELSE LIKE THAT
HG9mwh7aAfM_9 0 SO THEN THAT'S WHAT THE FOUNDATION IS ON THE CORONAL POLISH
gLn7ARrCQ6w_1 0 ONCE YOU REALLY LEARNED HOW TO RIDE FAKIE VERY WELL ALL OF SUDDEN YOU HAVE A WHOLE NEW OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ALL SORT OF DIFFERENT TRICKS
gLn7ARrCQ6w_2 0 THE KEY TO GETTING INTO THOSE TRICKS IS A LOT OF THE TIME THOSE LEARNING HOW TO DO A 180 AND WITHOUT DOING A 180 YOUR FAKIE SKILLS ARE ALMOST USELESS IN A LOT OF CASES
gLn7ARrCQ6w_3 0 YOU KNOW MUCH LIKE A BUNNY HOP MOST PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO DO 180S PICKING UP BOTH WHEELS AT THE SAME TIME AND WHIPPING THE BIKE AROUND AS FAST AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN AND LANDING BACKWARDS
gLn7ARrCQ6w_4 0 WHICH IS REALLY NOT THE OPTIMAL WAY TO DO CAUSE ONCE AGAIN ONCE YOU START TAKING IT TO MORE ADVANCE STAGES OF DOING 180S FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE GOING 180 DOWN SOME STAIRS OR YOU ARE GOING A 180 OVER A JUMP SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU HAVE A LOT LESS CONTROL OVER THE TRICK
gLn7ARrCQ6w_5 0 SO BASICALLY ONCE YOU WANT TO START TAKING YOUR 180S TO ALL SORTS OF NEW AVENUES THAT YOU THAT YOU HAVE NOT REALLY THOUGH ABOUT BEFORE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE MUCH LIKE A BUNNY HOP YOUR 180 STARTS WITH YOUR FRONT WHEEL COMING UP
gLn7ARrCQ6w_6 0 BUT YOU WANT TO START LOOKING TO YOUR INSIDE SHOULDER WHICH EVER WAY YOU NATURALLY WAY YOU WANT TO SPIN AND AS YOU COME IN YOU POP AND YOU PUSH THE BIKE THROUGH BUT YOU MAKE SURE TO KEEP LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER CAUSE YOU BODY BASICALLY WILL FOLLOW WHEREVER YOU LOOKS SO AS LONG AS YOU KEEP LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LAND JUST FINE
gLn7ARrCQ6w_7 0 IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SPIN A COMPLETE 180 BECAUSE ONCE YOU START LEARNING THEM YOU WOULD CARRY MUCH BETTER SPEED RIDING OUT BACKWARDS IF YOU SPIN IT REALLY A COMPLETE 180 RATHER THEN SPINNING YOU KNOW A 160 DEGREES OR SO WHERE YOU ARE BASICALLY GOING TO LAND IN A COMPLETE STOP

GTlPIqYkc0Y_1 0 HELLO I'M JEAN TOTZ WITH SWEETWATER KAYAKS IN ST PETE FLORIDA
GTlPIqYkc0Y_2 0 I'M HERE TO SHOW YOU HOW TO SEA KAYAK
GTlPIqYkc0Y_3 0 FIRST WE ARE GOING TO START WITH UNLOADING A KAYAK
GTlPIqYkc0Y_4 0 IT IS ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS I GET AS A WOMAN ON HOW TO MANAGE YOUR BOAT OFF OF YOUR CAR
GTlPIqYkc0Y_5 0 FIRST WE ARE GOING TO UNTIE IT
GTlPIqYkc0Y_6 0 I HAVE A FOAM BLOCK IN THE FRONT OF MY BOAT
GTlPIqYkc0Y_7 0 WHAT REALLY MAKES IT EASY FOR ME IS I HAVE A SLIDER IN THE BACK
GTlPIqYkc0Y_8 0 IT'S JUST A V SHAPED CRADLE THAT LETS ME SLIDE MY BOAT OFF
GTlPIqYkc0Y_9 0 IT CAN EASILY BE DONE WITH JUST ONE PERSON
GTlPIqYkc0Y_10 0 NOW TO CARRY IT I SIMPLY USE BALANCE
GTlPIqYkc0Y_11 0 I AM GOING TO GRAB IT RIGHT HERE AND PLACE IT ON MY SHOULDER BENDING MY KNEES LIFT RIGHT ON TOP OF MY SHOULDER AND STAND UP
GTlPIqYkc0Y_12 0 OFF I GO
GVMmatnTe_Q_1 0 I'M COOIE GREY-LAVIN AND IN THIS CLIP I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO GLUE DOWN THE MATERIALS YOU'RE USING IN YOUR MOSAIC STEPPING STONES
GVMmatnTe_Q_2 0 WHEN YOU'RE DONE AND FEEL SATISFIED WITH THE DESIGN YOU HAVE YOU'VE LAID YOUR TILES OUT THEN YOU MIX UP YOUR THIN-SET
GVMmatnTe_Q_3 0 YOU CAN BUY IT AT ANY HARDWARE STORE OR TILE STORE
GVMmatnTe_Q_4 0 IT'S A FINE POWDER AND IT'S THE MORTAR THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE AS A GLUE
GVMmatnTe_Q_5 0 YOU MIX THE POWDER WITH A LITTLE BIT OF WATER AND YOU WANT IT ABOUT THE CONSISTENCY OF PEANUT BUTTER
GVMmatnTe_Q_6 0 AFTER YOU MIX IT YOU LET IT SIT FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES
GVMmatnTe_Q_7 0 BECAUSE IT IS A CONCRETE THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT HAS TO HAPPEN SO IT HAS TO SET UP FOR A FEW MINUTES
GVMmatnTe_Q_8 0 ONCE YOU'VE GOT IT SET UP THE WAY YOU WANT IT AND YOU'VE GOT IT THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY THIS IS A LITTLE THIN WE NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR THIS ONE GET ALL THE LUMPS OUT LET IT SIT
GVMmatnTe_Q_9 0 YOU CAN DO THIS IN YOUR FINAL DESIGN STAGE SO IT'S ALL READY TO GO
GVMmatnTe_Q_10 0 AFTER IT SETS UP I TAKE AN OLD BUTTER KNIFE AND YOU TAKE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF GLUE PICK UP THE TILE LITTLE PIECE OF THE THIN-SET
GVMmatnTe_Q_11 0 AGAIN YOU DON'T WANT TO COVER UP TOO MUCH BECAUSE YOU NEED TO LEAVE ROOM FOR YOUR GROUT
GVMmatnTe_Q_12 0 GENTLY PLACE IT IN PLACE AND MOVE ON
GVMmatnTe_Q_13 0 THE OTHER WAY TO DO IT IS ACTUALLY PUT SOME OF THE THIN-SET DOWN ON THE TILE ITSELF FIRST PUT THE PIECE OVER IT AND GENTLY PRESS IN
GVMmatnTe_Q_14 0 IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH WAY YOU DO IT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A GOOD ADHESION WITH THE TILE
GVMmatnTe_Q_15 0 THEN AFTER YOU'VE GLUED YOUR WHOLE PIECE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING THE WAY YOU WANT IT YOU HAVE TO LET IT SIT AND CURE FOR 24 HOURS
GVMmatnTe_Q_16 0 REMEMBER TO MIX THE THIN SET LET IT SET UP FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES THEN REMIX IT
GVMmatnTe_Q_17 0 THEN YOU CAN APPLY YOUR TILES AND VARIOUS PIECES TO YOUR STEPPING STONE WITH THE THIN-SET THEN LET IT CURE FOR 24 HOURS BEFORE YOU GROUT
hbq9TOm0q5s_1 0 HOW DO YOU KILL FLEAS
hbq9TOm0q5s_2 0 WELL THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO KILL FLEAS THAT ARE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE AND EASILY GOTTEN AT YOUR LOCAL PET STORE
hbq9TOm0q5s_3 0 ON MY CART HERE I HAVE HERE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES THERE'S YOUR TOPICAL OINTMENTS WHICH ARE MY PREFERRED USAGE FOR KILLING AND PREVENTING FLEAS
hbq9TOm0q5s_4 0 THOUGH IN VERY BAD INFESTATIONS THESE HAVE TO BE USED IN CONJUNCTURE WITH THINGS LIKE THE POWDERS AND THE AEROSOL SPRAYS AND THE BOMBS
hbq9TOm0q5s_5 0 I DO NOT PREFER THE BOMBS MYSELF I DON'T THINK THEY WORK ALL THAT WELL AND THEY'RE KIND OF INTRUSIVE INTO YOUR HOME AS LOTS OF YOU HAVE TO DO A BOMB
hbq9TOm0q5s_6 0 THE AEROSOL SPRAYS ARE MUCH MUCH MORE DIRECT YOU CAN GET THEM EXACTLY IN THE PLACES YOU WANT TO GET THEM AND THEY'RE EASY TO CONTROL AND USE AS ARE THE POWDERS
hbq9TOm0q5s_7 0 BUT YOUR FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE IS GOING TO BE SOME SORT OF TOPICAL OINTMENT
hbq9TOm0q5s_8 0 NOW THESE ARE OINTMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO GO IN BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES ON THE ANIMAL
hbq9TOm0q5s_9 0 YOU SPREAD THE FUR OUT AND APPLY THEM
hbq9TOm0q5s_10 0 THEY ARE SPECIES SPECIFIC SO THERE'S A DOG AND THERE'S A CAT AND THEY ARE WEIGHT SPECIFIC THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN WEIGHT GROUPS
hbq9TOm0q5s_11 0 LIKE FOR INSTANCE THI S ONE IS FROM SIXTEEN TO THIRTY POUNDS AND THIS ONE IS FROM 46 TO SIXTY POUNDS
hbq9TOm0q5s_12 0 SO IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN BUYING THE OINTMENT THAT YOU KNOW THE POUNDAGE OF YOUR ANIMAL
hbq9TOm0q5s_13 0 YOU CAN BUY THESE FROM YOUR VET AND YOU CAN BUY THESE ALSO FROM YOUR LOCAL PET STORE
hbq9TOm0q5s_14 0 I PREFER THE FRONTLAND BRAND THE FRONTLINE BRAND THEY DO WORK THE BEST IN MY OPINION OVER THE YEARS THEY CAUSE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF IN FACT I HAVE EVER HAD ANY BAD REACTIONS ON THE FRONTLINE
hbq9TOm0q5s_15 0 BUT JUST BE AWARE THESE ARE ALL PESTICIDE PRODUCTS IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER AND YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN USING THEM ESPECIALLY WITH THE TOPICAL OINTMENTS
hbq9TOm0q5s_16 0 ONCE YOU USE A TOPICAL OINTMENT WHETHER IT WORKS OR NOT YOU CANNOT APPLY ANOTHER ONE FOR A MONTH
hbq9TOm0q5s_17 0 BECAUSE THAT IS THE EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME
hbq9TOm0q5s_18 0 YOU ALSO ONCE YOU USE A TOPICAL OINTMENT IT IS ADVISED NOT TO FLEA BATH THE ANIMAL OR FLEA DIP THE ANIMAL OR SPRAY THE ANIMAL WITH ANY OTHER KIND OF FLEA PRODUCT
hbq9TOm0q5s_19 0 AGAIN IT'S A PESTICIDE AND YOU CAN POISON YOUR ANIMAL IF YOU DON'T READ CAREFULLY ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS ON YOUR PACKAGING AND FOLLOW THEM TO THE T
G54hHUfnbK8_1 0 FOR THIS SECTION WE'RE GOING TO START LOOKING AT KEN-GI OR SWORD FORM ONE
G54hHUfnbK8_2 0 WE'LL DRAW THE FIRST MOTION FOR THIS TECHNIQUE IS SHOMENUCHI THE OVERHEAD STRIKE
G54hHUfnbK8_3 0 I COME UP THROUGH MY CENTER AND I CUT WITH A GOOD SHOMEN
G54hHUfnbK8_4 0 A GOOD SHOMEN IS PROJECTING IS LEADING THE TIP OF THE SWORD OUT AND AWAY
G54hHUfnbK8_5 0 IT'S AS IF I'M CASTING THE SWORD
G54hHUfnbK8_6 0 SO I'M HERE I COME UP CUT
G54hHUfnbK8_7 0 GOOD MOVEMENT FROM CENTER CASTING THE TIP AS IF THERE WERE AN APPLE OR SOME PIECE OF FRUIT ON THE END OF YOUR SWORD AND YOU'RE FLICKING IT OFF
G54hHUfnbK8_8 0 I COME UP CUT
G54hHUfnbK8_10 0 WE WANT TO HAVE HARMONY BETWEEN THE DROP OF THE BLADE AND THE CENTERING OF MY MOTION HERE
G54hHUfnbK8_11 0 AS MY BODY COMES TO POSITION THE SWORD COMES TO POSITION
G54hHUfnbK8_12 0 THEY COME TOGETHER SIMULTANEOUSLY
G54hHUfnbK8_13 0 THAT'S WHERE THE POWER IS AT
G54hHUfnbK8_14 0 IF IT GETS DISCOMBOBULATED MY HIPS ARE THERE FIRST OR THE SWORD'S THERE FIRST WE LOSE ALL THE POWER OF THE STRIKE
G54hHUfnbK8_16 0 THAT'S THE FIRST PORTION OF KEN-GI ONE
hDQPbIIXONo_1 0 HI THIS IS BRUCE LESSELS FROM ZOAR OUTDOOR FOR EXPERTVILLAGE.COM TALKING ABOUT CAMPING
hDQPbIIXONo_2 0 WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN AT NIGHT IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOME WAY TO SEE AND TO GO ABOUT DOING TASKS SUCH AS COOKING AND PUTTING YOURSELF TO BED AT NIGHT AND SETTING UP YOUR TENT IF YOU NEED TO IN THE DARK
hDQPbIIXONo_3 0 SO A HEADLAMP IS GOOD WAY TO DO THAT THEY MAKE SOME REALLY NICE HEADLAMPS NOWADAYS THIS IS A LED HEADLAMP THAT HAS A ROTATING BULB SO THAT YOU CAN CHANGE THE ANGLE OF IT
hDQPbIIXONo_4 0 IT KEEPS YOUR HANDS FREE AND ALLOWS YOU TO CONCENTRATE ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH YOUR HANDS AND GIVES ENOUGH LIGHT THAT YOU CAN REALLY SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING
hDQPbIIXONo_5 0 IF YOU WANT TO USE SORT OF MORE DEFUSED LIGHTING YOU WANT A WAY TO SEE TO READ OR TO DO OTHER TASKS AT NIGHT A PROPANE LANTERN IS A GREAT WAY TO GO AND THESE OF COURSE ARE BIGGER AND HARDER TO CARRY IN A BACKPACK BUT IF YOU'RE EITHER CANOE CAMPING OR CAR CAMPING A PROPANE LANTERN CAN BE A GREAT OPTION AND CAN GIVE YOU PLENTY OF LIGHT AROUND THE CAMPFIRE OR THE PICNIC TABLE OR JUST OUTSIDE READING IN THE LAST FEW HOURS OF THE DAY
GJNxi_ipEio_1 0 THE WOOD CHOP WITH A MEDICINE BALL IS JUST A VARIATION OF THE WOOD CHOP MOVE
GJNxi_ipEio_2 0 IF YOUR CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT ELSE I'VE DONE WITH IT JUST FEEL FREE TO BROWSE AROUND AND LOOK FOR THE WOOD CHOP WHERE THERE'S SITTING ON THE BALL THERE'S STANDING AND HOW DIFFERENT AH THE DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF THE MOVE SO THAT YOU CAN GET YOU DON'T GET BORED LIKE THAT YOU KNOW
GJNxi_ipEio_3 0 SO NOW I HAVE A FOUR-POUND BALL
GJNxi_ipEio_4 0 AND I LIKE TO START LOWER AND THEN WORK MY WAY UP BECAUSE SOMETIMES WITH THE HEAVIER BALL IF YOU DROP IT YOU CAN GET HURT
GJNxi_ipEio_5 0 NOW THE IDEA HERE WITH THE MOVE IS MUST START FROM THE FEET UP
GJNxi_ipEio_6 0 YOUR FEET ARE SHOULDER WIDTH APART TOES SLIGHTLY OUT KNEES ARE SLIGHTLY BENT AND THE HIPS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT
GJNxi_ipEio_7 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU TUCK THOSE HIPS MEANING HIP BONES ARE COMING TOWARDS YOUR RIBS
GJNxi_ipEio_8 0 SO IT'S LIKE SHORTENING THE DISTANCE HERE AND ABDOMINAL AREA
GJNxi_ipEio_9 0 OR LIKE SOMEBODY'S PULLING THE FRONT OF YOUR PANTS YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR ZIPPER SEE IF EVERYTHING IS OKAY THERE SO THAT'S THE MOVE RIGHT HERE
GJNxi_ipEio_10 0 KEEP YOUR ABS TUCKED IN SO SUCKING IN THAT ABDOMINAL WALL OR THE BELLY BUTTON TOWARDS THE SPINE
GJNxi_ipEio_11 0 SHOULDERS DOWN AND THE CHEST IS UP AND OPEN
GJNxi_ipEio_12 0 SO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS MOVE THE SHOULDERS DON'T WANT TO DO THIS ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE POSTURAL ISSUES THAT MAY WANT TO HAPPEN
GJNxi_ipEio_13 0 SO BE AWARE OF THAT
GJNxi_ipEio_14 0 NOW WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE TWIST JUST LIKE YOU HAVE AN AX AND YOU'RE CHOPPING WOOD YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE SAME THING WITH THE BALL AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME ACROSS THE BODY
GJNxi_ipEio_15 0 AS I'M DOING THAT NOTICE THAT MY HIPS ARE STAYING IN FRONT MY HIPS ARE NOT MOVING
GJNxi_ipEio_16 0 I'M MOVING THE UPPER BODY IN GOING DOWN ACROSS LIKE AN AX
GJNxi_ipEio_17 0 GOING OVER AND UP AND DOWN
GJNxi_ipEio_18 0 IF THIS BOTHERS YOUR SHOULDERS THAT'S A SIGN THAT SOMETHING'S GOING ON YOU CAN KEEP IT RIGHT HERE AND NOT GO SO FAR LOW
GJNxi_ipEio_19 0 WHAT THE IDEA IS TO GET THAT TWIST IN THERE TO WORK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BODY
GJNxi_ipEio_20 0 THEN YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT TO THE OTHER SIDE KEEPING THE BELLY BUTTON ALWAYS STEADY FACING FRONT KEEPING THAT TUCKED
GJNxi_ipEio_21 0 BEFORE YOU KNOW IT YOU'LL BE VERY STRONG AND HOPEFULLY YOU'LL BE COMING BACK FOR MORE
GJNxi_ipEio_22 0 SO SEE YOU SOON
GSX_5gNCnRo_1 0 I FOUND OUT ABOUT ACTUARIAL SCIENCE AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BECOMING A ACTUARY WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE
GSX_5gNCnRo_2 0 I WAS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND I WAS LOOKING FOR A SUMMER JOB AND A COMPANY FROM CHICAGO CAME TO THE COLLEGE TO INTERVIEW PEOPLE TO HIRE AS SUMMER STUDENTS
GSX_5gNCnRo_3 0 THAT WAS MY FIRST EXPOSURE TO ACTUARIAL WORK
GSX_5gNCnRo_4 0 I TOOK THE JOB AND ENJOYED THE WORK AND FOUND HOW THE EXAMS WORKED AND THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER I WOULD LIKE TO BE AN ACTUARY
GSX_5gNCnRo_5 0 I WAS ALREADY MAJORING IN MATHEMATICS AND KNEW I DIDN'T WANT TO BE A TEACHER
GSX_5gNCnRo_6 0 I THOUGHT I MIGHT GO INTO PROGRAMMING THAT WAS CERTAINLY AN OPTION FOR ME BUT I LIKED THE COMPANY THAT I WORKED FOR I WORKED THERE FOR TWO SUMMERS THEY OFFERED ME A JOB WHEN I GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE AND I TOOK IT
GSX_5gNCnRo_7 0 SO THAT WAS A PRETTY EASY ENTRY INTO THE FIELD
GSX_5gNCnRo_8 0 ONCE YOU ARE AN ACTUARIAL STUDENT GENERALLY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL HELP YOU ALSO CONSULTING FIRMS WILL HELP YOU ATTAIN YOUR FELLOWSHIP BY GIVING YOU STUDY TIME AND ENCOURAGING YOU TO PASS EXAMS BY GIVING YOU INCENTIVE RAISES IF YOU DO PROGRESS THROUGH THE EXAMINATIONS
GSX_5gNCnRo_9 0 IF YOU PASS THE EXAMINATIONS YOU DON'T REALLY EVEN NEED AN EDUCATION TO BECOME AN ACTUARY
GSX_5gNCnRo_10 0 I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE THAT HAVE GOTTEN THEIR FELLOWSHIPS WITHOUT EVER HAVING GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE
GSX_5gNCnRo_11 0 NOW THAT'S NOT TO COMMON THESE DAYS BUT YOU ARE ABLE TO LEARN WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TO BECOME AND ACTUARY BY STUDYING THE MATERIAL THAT IS PROVIDED BY THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES
GjvD6mWI2aE_1 0 MIKE LOPEZ HI I'M MIKE LOPEZ WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'LL BE DISCUSSING HEROSCAPE AND ITS EXPANSION SETS
GjvD6mWI2aE_2 0 AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER PUTTING YOUR WALL TOGETHER
GjvD6mWI2aE_3 0 PUTTING YOUR WALL TOGETHER CONSIST OF PUTTING PIECES TOGETHER AND AS WE SEE HERE WE HAVE TWO STRAIGHT END PIECES THAT HAVE GROOVES ON EQUAL AND OPPOSITE SIDES AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO MATCH THE GROOVES ON THE SIDES UP AND SLIDE THEM TOGETHER
GjvD6mWI2aE_4 0 NOW ONCE AGAIN YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE GROOVE SIDE BECAUSE IF YOU DO NOT THEN YOUR PIECES WILL NOT SLIDE TOGETHER
GjvD6mWI2aE_5 0 SO YOU WILL TAKE THE PIECES AND YOU WILL MATCH THE GROOVES UP AND SLIDE THEM TOGETHER LIKE SO
GjvD6mWI2aE_6 0 AND ONCE AGAIN MAKE SURE THAT YOU MATCH THEM UP QUICKLY BECAUSE AS WE SEE HERE THERE IS A SPACE
GjvD6mWI2aE_7 0 SO PULL IT APART AGAIN AND MAKE SURE TO PUSH THEM ALL THE WAY TOGETHER SO THERE IS NO SPACE IN BETWEEN THEM AND THEN YOU WILL TAKE THE BOTTOM PIECES THAT ARE HEXAGONAL AND MATCH THEM UP TO THE HEXAGONAL PIECES ON YOUR GAME BOARD
GjvD6mWI2aE_8 0 AND THAT IS THE BEGINNING OF YOUR WALL
gU2a1iWlJNA_1 0 ALL RIGHT THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT BOUNCE JUGGLING IS WHAT KIND OF BALL TO USE
gU2a1iWlJNA_2 0 THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT ONES TO USE
gU2a1iWlJNA_3 0 I LIKE TO USE LACROSSE BALLS
gU2a1iWlJNA_4 0 YOU CAN GET THEM PRETTY MUCH AT EVERY SPORTING GOODS STORE AND THEY'RE REALLY CHEAP
gU2a1iWlJNA_5 0 THEY DON'T LAST FOREVER AND AS YOU CAN SEE THEY'LL GET STAINED AND YOU CAN'T REALLY EVER GET THEM TO BE THE ORIGINAL COLOR THAT THEY WERE AGAIN
gU2a1iWlJNA_6 0 BUT CONSIDERING YOUR OTHER OPTION IS REALLY A SILICONE JUGGLING BALL THAT RUN ANYWHERE FROM $30 TO $50 DOLLAR A PIECE
gU2a1iWlJNA_7 0 THEY DON'T BOUNCE AS WELL BUT I THINK THE PRICE MAKES UP FOR IT
gU2a1iWlJNA_8 0 THE OTHER THING THAT YOU NEED IS CEMENT
gU2a1iWlJNA_9 0 SOME PEOPLE USE A SLAB OF MARBLE BECAUSE THAT THEY GET BECAUSE IT'S PERFECTLY SMOOTH AND PERFECTLY FLAT
gU2a1iWlJNA_10 0 BUT I WOULD USE I WOULD SAY SIDEWALK CEMENT WITHOUT ANY BIG DIVOTS TAKEN OUT OF IT OR ANYTHING IS A GOOD PLACE BECAUSE YOU NEED TO KNOW WHICH WAY THE BALL IS GOING TO BOUNCE BACK UP
gU2a1iWlJNA_11 0 I WOULD ALSO STAND CLEAR OF BLACK TOP BECAUSE IT'S TOO PITTY BUT ONCE YOU HAVE THOSE THINGS SQUARED AWAY YOU'RE READY TO START BOUNCE JUGGLING
GZSOTSSh1hU_1 0 SO NOW THAT WE HAVE OUR GLAZE MIXED WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY
GZSOTSSh1hU_2 0 THE ORIGINAL AND OLD FASHIONED METHOD OF DOING THIS BY THE WAY THIS IS MY LARGE COMMERCIAL SPOON
GZSOTSSh1hU_3 0 WHEN YOU MIX THIS GLAZE YOU WANT TO PULL FROM THE BOTTOM AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE BRINGING EVERYTHING AROUND
GZSOTSSh1hU_4 0 THE OLD WAY TO TEST THE THICKNESS OF YOUR GLAZE IS TO PUT A FINGER IN THERE AND JUST SEE IF IT BREAKS ON THE FOLDS OF YOUR KNUCKLES
GZSOTSSh1hU_5 0 AND IT SHOULD BE THICK AROUND YOUR FINGER AND BREAKING ON THE FOLDS OF YOUR KNUCKLES
GZSOTSSh1hU_6 0 THAT'S ABOUT THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY FOR GLAZE
GZSOTSSh1hU_7 0 NOW THAT'S NOT A COMPLETELY FOOL PROOF WAY OF TESTING THE CONSISTENCY OF YOUR GLAZE
GZSOTSSh1hU_8 0 THE ONLY WAY TO BE A HUNDRED PERCENT CERTAIN IS TO USE A HYDROMETER
GZSOTSSh1hU_9 0 LIKE I SAID THIS MEASURES THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE GLAZE WHICH IS THE AMOUNT OF WATER IN THIS MIXTURE
GZSOTSSh1hU_10 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO MIX THIS UP VERY WELL
GZSOTSSh1hU_11 0 THIS GLAZE DOES SETTLE OUT RATHER QUICKLY SO EVERY TIME YOU'RE GOING TO DO ANYTHING WITH IT YOU'RE GOING TO STIR IT
GZSOTSSh1hU_12 0 YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR SPONGE GET IT JUST BARELY MOIST AND WIPE OFF YOUR HYDROMETER
GZSOTSSh1hU_13 0 YOU DON'T WANT THE HYDROMETER WET BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT TO STICK EITHER
GZSOTSSh1hU_14 0 AND THEN YOU JUST DROP THIS RIGHT IN THERE GENTLY AND LET IT FALL UNTIL IT STOPS FALLING
GZSOTSSh1hU_15 0 AND ONCE IT SETTLES YOU CAN TAP THE SIDE OF THE BUCKET JUST GENTLY AND THAT CAN URGE IT TO ITS FINAL POSITION
GZSOTSSh1hU_16 0 ONCE IT SETTLES YOU LOOK AND SEE WHERE THE TOP OF THE MENISCUS IS ON THE HYDROMETER
GZSOTSSh1hU_17 0 AND THAT TELLS YOU THE READING
GZSOTSSh1hU_18 0 IN THIS CASE WE'VE GOT FOURTEEN TWENTY WHICH IS JUST RIGHT FOR THIS PARTICULAR GLAZE
GZSOTSSh1hU_19 0 USUALLY BETWEEN FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN FIFTY IS A HYDROMETER READING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR IN STONEWARE GLAZES
h_etJv1NzS8_1 0 HI I'M GRETCHEN RIVAS WITH RELAX TO THE MAX MASSAGE THERAPY AND TODAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO GIVE A REALLY GOOD CHAIR MASSAGE
h_etJv1NzS8_2 0 NOW I AM THINKING MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE MASSAGE CHAIRS LIKE I HAVE AT THEIR OFFICE OR AT THEIR HOME SO WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS AT A REGULAR CHAIR OR YOU MIGHT FIND MOST PEOPLE JUST SITTING AT THEIR COMPUTER OR JUST SITTING AT THEIR OFFICE WISHING SOMEBODY WOULD COME BY AND RUB THEIR NECK AND SHOULDERS
h_etJv1NzS8_3 0 SO JUST GO AHEAD AND DROP YOUR HEAD A LITTLE BIT RIGHT THERE
h_etJv1NzS8_4 0 SO WHEN YOU ARE WORKING ON SOMEBODY LIKE THAT YOU CAN WORK THROUGH CLOTHES YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ANY SPECIAL OILS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND JUST COME THROUGH AND KIND OF WORK A LITTLE BIT ON THE BACK AND WHEN YOU ARE DOING THAT YOU CAN USE YOUR LOOSE FISTS RIGHT HERE AND JUST PRESS IN TO THE MUSCLES IN THE BACK AREA AND RUB THROUGH THE NECK LIKE THIS A LITTLE BIT AND RUB ESPECIALLY ALONG THE OCCIPITAL AREA RIGHT HERE AT THE BASE OF THE SKULL
h_etJv1NzS8_5 0 IT FEELS REALLY GOOD AND WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS DO A LITTLE LIFT WHERE YOU JUST KIND OF USE THE FOREHEAD AND THE BASE OF THE SKULL AND LIFT UP AND THAT KIND OF LEAVES A LOT OF TENSION IN PEOPLES NECKS AND HELPS THEM
h_etJv1NzS8_6 0 YOU CAN DO A LITTLE SQUEEZE IN THE TRAP AREA AND DOWN THE ARMS IT FEELS GOOD
h_etJv1NzS8_7 0 STRETCH THEM BACK A LITTLE BIT AND OPEN UP THAT PEC AREA AND RUB THIS RIGHT HERE ON PEOPLE THAT USUALLY HELPS
h_etJv1NzS8_8 0 JUST KIND OF WORK THAT AND SQUEEZE IT A LITTLE BIT AND RUB SOME AND THEY NEVER WANT YOU TO STOP BECAUSE THAT IS HOW IT FEELS GOOD AND THAT IS HOW YOU GIVE A REALLY GOOD CHAIR MASSAGE
hJPX0grNGho_1 0 HI I'M JEREMY HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
hJPX0grNGho_2 0 I'M HERE TO SHOW YOU SOME MORE ABOUT THE DIFFERENT BALLOON VARIETIES
hJPX0grNGho_3 0 RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING AHEAD AND TALK ABOUT THE 160S VARIETY OF BALLOONS
hJPX0grNGho_4 0 THE 160 BASICALLY MEANS THAT I HAVE THE ONE DIAMETER ONE FULLY INFLATED AND SIXTY LONG
hJPX0grNGho_5 0 BECAUSE OF THE SMALLER DIAMETER YOU CAN ACTUALLY WHEN YOU TWIST IT YOU CAN GET A LOT MORE TWIST OUT OF IT THAN WHAT YOU CAN OUT A 260 IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT YOU ARE NOT FIGHTING MUCH BALLOON
hJPX0grNGho_6 0 USUALLY 160S YOU DON'T USE FOR DESIGNS IN GENERAL UNLESS YOU WANT SOMETHING SMALL OR DETAIL WORK ON SOMETHING REALLY LARGE
hJPX0grNGho_7 0 FOR EXAMPLE THIS TURTLE IS NUN CHUNKS ARE MADE OUT OF 160 AND YOU DON'T WANT THE NUN CHUNKS TO BE AS LARGE AS HIS ARMS
hJPX0grNGho_8 0 IN THE OTHER CASE I HAVE THE FAIRY WHICH IF YOU ALSO MAKE IT SMALLER AND THE LADYBUG MY SMALLEST DESIGN
hJPX0grNGho_9 0 IT'S ACTUALLY THREE 1/2 LONG AND THE NICE THING ABOUT 160S IS THAT THEY ARE CHEAPER THAN THE 260S BY MAYBE A DOLLAR A BAG
hJPX0grNGho_10 0 BUT CHEAPER IS CHEAPER
GM9nzQOBMMQ_1 0 HI THIS IS JOHN AND IN THIS CLIP I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THE TOOLS NEEDED TO COMPLETE OUR PROJECT
GM9nzQOBMMQ_2 0 FIRST WE'RE GOING TO NEED A PENCIL AND TAPE MEASURE TO HELP US DO ALL THE MEASURING AND MARKING AND DESIGNING AND DRAWING UP OUR PROJECTS
GM9nzQOBMMQ_3 0 TO CUT OUT THE END PIECES WE USE A RADIAL ARM SAW TO SIZE UP THE LENGTH A TABLE SAW TO CUT THE WIDTH AND A BAND SAW TO CUT OUR ANGLES
GM9nzQOBMMQ_4 0 FOR OUR LONG SIDES THE BOTTOM AND THE HANDLE WE USE THE RADIAL ARM SAW TO CUT THE LENGTH AND THE TABLE SAW TO CUT THE WIDTH
GM9nzQOBMMQ_5 0 TO ASSEMBLE ALL OF OUR PIECES TOGETHER WE NEED A DRILL WITH A FEW DIFFERENT SIZES OF DRILL BITS DEPENDING ON IF YOU WANT TO COUNTER-SINK YOUR SCREWS OR NOT
GM9nzQOBMMQ_6 0 AND IN ADDITION WE NEED A SCREWDRIVER BIT FOR OUR DRILL
GM9nzQOBMMQ_7 0 FOR THE HANDLE NOTCH WE USED A DRILL AND A BAND SAW TO FINISH CUTTING IT OUT
GM9nzQOBMMQ_8 0 AND FOR OUR DIVIDERS WE USED THE SAME PROCEDURE OF USING A DRILL TO DRILL A HOLE AND A BAND SAW TO FINISH CUTTING IT OUT
GM9nzQOBMMQ_9 0 AND LASTLY WE FINISHED UP OUR PROJECT BY SANDING IT WITH A FEW DIFFERENT GRITS OF SAND PAPER
gtCqNfEDSB4_1 0 HI THIS IS STEVE BAUMAN FROM SUMMERHAYS MUSIC IN MURRAY UTAH
gtCqNfEDSB4_2 0 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BASS GUITAR TODAY
gtCqNfEDSB4_3 0 AND ONE OF THE TOPICS IS HOW TO RE-STRING A BASS
gtCqNfEDSB4_4 0 THE CORRECT WAY TO DO THAT
gtCqNfEDSB4_5 0 SO I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE HOW TO DO THAT
gtCqNfEDSB4_6 0 THERE'S A LOT OF WRONG WAYS OUT THERE
gtCqNfEDSB4_7 0 BUT THERE IS A FEW RIGHT WAYS TO DO IT TOO
gtCqNfEDSB4_8 0 BUT THE MAIN THING IS YOU DON'T WANT TO EVER DO ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO DAMAGE YOUR BASS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
gtCqNfEDSB4_9 0 IT'S USUALLY NOT A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE ALL OF THE STRINGS OFF AT ONCE
gtCqNfEDSB4_10 0 THAT CAN DO THINGS THAT CAN DAMAGE THE NECK
gtCqNfEDSB4_11 0 SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU JUST DO ONE AT A TIME
gtCqNfEDSB4_12 0 SO HERE I'VE GOT A BASS THAT HAS THE LOW E STRING TAKEN OFF
gtCqNfEDSB4_13 0 AND I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PUT IT ON
gtCqNfEDSB4_14 0 SO THE FIRST STEP IS JUST TO FEED THE STRING THROUGH THE DESIGNATED HOLES DOWN HERE AT THE BRIDGE
gtCqNfEDSB4_15 0 NOW SOME BASSES HAVE THE HAVE THE HOLES IN THE BACK OF THE BASS
gtCqNfEDSB4_16 0 AND THAT'S JUST YOU KNOW PUT THE STRINGS THROUGH THE BODY
gtCqNfEDSB4_17 0 BUT IF IT'S A BRIDGE LIKE THIS THERE'S JUST A HOLE RIGHT HERE FOR YOU TO FEED THE STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_18 0 AND THEN ONCE YOU DO THAT
gtCqNfEDSB4_19 0 JUST PULL THE STRING ALL THE WAY THROUGH
gtCqNfEDSB4_20 0 AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS IN THE RIGHT SPOT
gtCqNfEDSB4_21 0 AND THAT THIS IS GOING OVER WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO COME OVER THE SADDLE
gtCqNfEDSB4_22 0 NOW THIS IS CALLED THE SADDLE RIGHT IN HERE
gtCqNfEDSB4_23 0 SO ONCE YOU DO THAT THEN WE MOVE UP TO THE OTHER END OF THE BASS
gtCqNfEDSB4_24 0 ONCE WE'RE HERE WE WANT TO HAVE THE RIGHT LENGTH OF STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_25 0 BECAUSE IF NOT YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH A TON OF WRAPPING
gtCqNfEDSB4_26 0 WHICH CAN BE WHICH CAN AFFECT THE INTONATION OF THE BASS
gtCqNfEDSB4_27 0 AND IT CAN ALSO MAKE THE STRING POP OFF OF THE TUNER
gtCqNfEDSB4_28 0 SO GOOD RULE OF THUMB IS TO EXTEND PULL THE STRING ALL THE WAY TIGHT
gtCqNfEDSB4_29 0 AND JUST EXTEND IT ALL THE WAY
gtCqNfEDSB4_30 0 AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE A GOOD FOUR OR FIVE INCHES BEYOND THE TUNING PEG
gtCqNfEDSB4_31 0 THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE WRAPPING IN IT
gtCqNfEDSB4_32 0 SO JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO WARP AT LEAST A COUPLE TIMES
gtCqNfEDSB4_33 0 YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE TOO LONG
gtCqNfEDSB4_34 0 BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE TOO SHORT
gtCqNfEDSB4_35 0 SO THE FIRST STEP IS JUST TO STICK THE END OF THE STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_36 0 WELL FIRST OF ALL YOU WANT TO CUT THE STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_37 0 WITH JUST SOME GOOD WIRE CUTTERS TO THE RIGHT LENGTH THAT YOU WANT IT
gtCqNfEDSB4_38 0 SO YOU WANT TO TAKE THE END OF THE STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_39 0 AND BE CAREFUL BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY SHARP ON THE END
gtCqNfEDSB4_40 0 AND JUST STICK IT DOWN INTO THE HOLE THAT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS TUNING MACHINE
gtCqNfEDSB4_41 0 THERE'S A HOLE THAT GOES STRAIGHT DOWN
gtCqNfEDSB4_42 0 SO STICK IT DOWN THERE FIRST
gtCqNfEDSB4_43 0 DON'T WRAP IT FIRST
gtCqNfEDSB4_44 0 STICK IT DOWN THERE FIRST
gtCqNfEDSB4_45 0 AND THEN ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS BRING IT OFF
gtCqNfEDSB4_46 0 AND PUT SOME CREASES IN THE STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_47 0 AND JUST WRAP IT ONCE OR TWICE
gtCqNfEDSB4_48 0 AND YOU WANT TI TO COME OFF ON THE INSIDE OF THE BASS
gtCqNfEDSB4_49 0 NOT COME OFF ON THE OUTSIDE
gtCqNfEDSB4_50 0 BECAUSE THAT WAY YOU WANT IT TO BE ABLE TO TURN THE RIGHT WAY
gtCqNfEDSB4_51 0 SO WRAP THE STRING ONCE OR TWICE CLOCKWISE
gtCqNfEDSB4_52 0 AND THEN PUSH THE STRING DOWN
gtCqNfEDSB4_53 0 SO THAT YOU'RE PRESSING IT AGAINST THE THE HEADSTOCK HERE
gtCqNfEDSB4_54 0 AND FEED IT THROUGH WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO
gtCqNfEDSB4_55 0 AND THEN JUST START WINDING
gtCqNfEDSB4_56 0 YOU'LL WANT TO KEEP SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THIS STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_57 0 AND PUSH IT DOWN
gtCqNfEDSB4_58 0 SO THAT IT DOESN'T COME OUT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
gtCqNfEDSB4_59 0 AND ALSO YOU WANT IT
gtCqNfEDSB4_60 0 SO THAT IT'S WINDING DOWN TOWARDS THE BASS
gtCqNfEDSB4_61 0 NOT WINDING FROM THE BOTTOM UP
gtCqNfEDSB4_62 0 SO JUST WIND IT UP
gtCqNfEDSB4_63 0 KIND OF MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE STAYING IN RIGHT POSITION
gtCqNfEDSB4_64 0 MAKING SURE THAT DOWN AT THE SADDLE IT'S STAYING WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE
gtCqNfEDSB4_65 0 AND ONCE YOU GET IT TIGHT ENOUGH
gtCqNfEDSB4_66 0 AND BRING THE BRING THE STRING UP TO PITCH
gtCqNfEDSB4_67 0 AND YOU WANT TO PUT SOME TENSION ON IT
gtCqNfEDSB4_68 0 IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE ALL THE WAY TIGHT ALL THE WAY TO PITCH
gtCqNfEDSB4_69 0 BUT YOU JUST PUT SOME TENSION ON IT BEFORE YOU START ON THE NEXT STRING

H_JOvc64wb8_2 0 ONE OF THE MOST COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT ESPRESSO BLENDS OR ESPRESSO ROAST IS THAT ESPRESSO IS ROASTED DARKER THAN NORMAL COFFEE WHICH IS UNNECESSARILY TRUE
H_JOvc64wb8_3 0 YOU CAN USE WHATEVER COFFEE YOU WANT TO MAKE ESPRESSO SHOTS
H_JOvc64wb8_4 0 WHAT MAKES ESPRESSO ESPRESSO IS THE EXTRACTION PROCESS THE PROCEDURE THAT IS INVOLVED IN MAKING THE ESPRESSO
H_JOvc64wb8_5 0 AND ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS IS THE FACT THAT THE RATIO OF COFFEE TO WATER IS MUCH HIGHER IN A SHOT OF ESPRESSO THAN IT IS IN THE NORMAL CUP OF COFFEE

gMwEpZwaX-M_1 0 HI I AM JESSICA MEICZINGER WITH SIMPLY DESIGN EVENTS
gMwEpZwaX-M_2 0 AND TODAY I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO PUT TOGETHER A SIMPLE DO IT YOURSELF CENTERPIECE FOR A GARDEN THEME WEDDING
gMwEpZwaX-M_3 0 THE FIRST THING TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IS FINDING THE PERFECT CONTAINER FOR YOUR CANDLE CENTERPIECE
gMwEpZwaX-M_4 0 KEEP IN MIND YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT HEIGHT
gMwEpZwaX-M_5 0 YOU WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE CAN EITHER LOOK THROUGH IF IT IS TALL OR SEE OVER
gMwEpZwaX-M_6 0 BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT YOUR GUESTS TAKING THE CENTERPIECES OFF THE TABLES TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER
gMwEpZwaX-M_7 0 YOU CAN FIND DIFFERENT HURRICANES AND DIFFERENT GLASS CONTAINERS IN LOCAL DISCOUNT STORES
gMwEpZwaX-M_8 0 YOU CAN ORDER THEM ON LINE THROUGH DIFFERENT WEB SITES IN BULK
gMwEpZwaX-M_9 0 OR VISIT YOUR LOCAL CRAFT STORES
gMwEpZwaX-M_10 0 THEY HAVE DIFFERENT CONTAINERS IN DIFFERENT SIZES AND COLORS AS WELL
gMwEpZwaX-M_11 0 SO THOSE THAT'S JUST SOME TIPS ON HOW TO PURCHASE A GLASS CONTAINER AND FIND THE RIGHT CONTAINER FOR YOUR DO IT YOURSELF GARDEN THEME WEDDING CENTERPIECES
HEdDKhVJOYw_1 0 THE NEXT STEP THAT WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON IS DEALING WITH YOUR OASIS
HEdDKhVJOYw_2 0 IT COMES IN EITHER CUP FORM OR BRICK FORM
HEdDKhVJOYw_3 0 THE BRICK FORM COMES IN MANY DIFFERENT COLORS SUCH AS ORANGE YELLOW EVEN A HOT GREEN
HEdDKhVJOYw_4 0 IT'S OKAY TO LET THAT SHOW
HEdDKhVJOYw_5 0 IT MAKES GOOD PINEAPPLE CHUNKS IF YOU'RE DOING A HAWAIIAN ARRANGEMENT OR IF YOUR COLOR SCHEME IS REALLY BRIGHT AND VIBRANT
HEdDKhVJOYw_6 0 WITH THESE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE TO DIP IT IN
HEdDKhVJOYw_7 0 JUST PUSH IT IN AND LET THE AIR BUBBLES COME OUT
HEdDKhVJOYw_8 0 NEVER EVER POUR WATER ON TOP OF YOUR OASIS
HEdDKhVJOYw_9 0 IT CLOSES UP THE PORES AND WILL NOT SOAK UP THE PROPER AMOUNT OF WATER
HEdDKhVJOYw_10 0 IF IT'S HAVING TROUBLE IT'S GOT TO TURN UPSIDE DOWN AND LET IT SOAK
HEdDKhVJOYw_11 0 IT WILL KIND OF JUST FLOAT THERE A LITTLE BIT
HEdDKhVJOYw_12 0 NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW THE BRICK WORKS
HEdDKhVJOYw_13 0 AGAIN SET IT IN THERE
HEdDKhVJOYw_14 0 YOU CAN ALREADY SEE THAT IT'S SOAKING UP A LOT OF WATER
HEdDKhVJOYw_15 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THE ENTIRE BRICK TURNS A DARK GREEN
HEdDKhVJOYw_16 0 THAT MEANS ITS ABSORBED THE WATER
HEdDKhVJOYw_17 0 OTHERWISE YOU'RE GOING TO BE CUTTING INTO IT AND FINDING SOME DRY SPOTS
HEdDKhVJOYw_18 0 THAT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM FOR YOUR FLOWERS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DRINK WATER AND THEY'RE GOING TO WILT AND YOUR ARRANGEMENT IS GOING TO LOOK HORRIBLE
HEdDKhVJOYw_19 0 IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME BUT IT'S WORTH THE TIME AND EFFORT
HEdDKhVJOYw_20 0 I CAN NOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH DO NOT POUR WATER ON TOP BECAUSE IT CLOSES UP THE PORES AND IT WILL NOT ABSORB THE WATER
HEdDKhVJOYw_21 0 DON'T PUSH IT DOWN EITHER
HEdDKhVJOYw_22 0 TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON IT WILL CLOSE UP THE PORES
HEdDKhVJOYw_23 0 UNFORTUNATELY OUR BOWL IS A LITTLE SHALLOW BUT IT WILL ABSORB ALL THE WAY THROUGH BECAUSE IT WILL ABSORB FROM THE BOTTOM
HEdDKhVJOYw_24 0 OUR NEXT STEP WILL BE WIRING OUR CYMBIDIUMS ON OUR WIRE
GcI-VbklEus_1 0 THE MOST LOGICAL PLACE TO ME TO KEEP YOUR DISHTOWELS AND HAND TOWELS ARE OVER NEAR THE SINK BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE USUALLY GOING TO BE USING THEM THE MOST
GcI-VbklEus_2 0 I DON'T HAVE ANY STORAGE SPACE LEFT OVER BY MY SINK SO I KEEP MINE OVER HERE BY THE OVEN WHICH I DON'T HAVE THAT BIG OF A KITCHEN SO IT DOESN'T MAKE THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE
GcI-VbklEus_3 0 BUT I JUST HAVE ALL MY DISH TOWELS FOLDED IN HERE AND JUST KEPT IN THIS DRAWER AND THEN IN ANOTHER DRAWER I HAVE MY NAPKINS AND MY DISH TOWELS AND MY TABLECLOTHS ALL IN THIS DRAWER
GcI-VbklEus_4 0 I DON'T HAVE PAPER NAPKINS OR PAPER TOWELS BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL OPTIONS FOR PLACES TO STORE THOSE TOO
GcI-VbklEus_5 0 AGAIN I THINK THE MOST LOGICAL PLACE TO KEEP THEM IS OVER BY THE SINK
GcI-VbklEus_6 0 THERE ARE YOU CAN FIND THINGS WHERE YOU CAN STAND UP PAPER TOWELS
GcI-VbklEus_7 0 THERE ARE LOTS OF CONTAINERS THAT YOU CAN KEEP NAPKINS IN
GcI-VbklEus_8 0 YOU CAN EVEN JUST KEEP NAPKINS IN A CUP OR ON A TRAY
GcI-VbklEus_9 0 JUST ANYTHING TO KEEP THEM CONTAINED IN A CERTAIN SPACE
GcI-VbklEus_10 0 SO AFTER YOU USE YOUR DISH TOWELS THEN YOU ALSO NEED A PLACE TO PUT YOUR DIRTY DISH TOWELS
GcI-VbklEus_11 0 AND I PUT THEM IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LAUNDRY ROOM WHICH I DON'T I JUST HAVE THIS BASKET HERE WITH A REMOVABLE INSERT THAT I JUST PUT ALL MY DIRTY DISH TOWELS AND WASHCLOTHS THAT I USE FOR CLEANING AND HAND TOWELS IN HERE
GcI-VbklEus_12 0 AND THEN WHEN I WANT TO WASH THEM I CAN JUST TAKE THIS WHOLE LITTLE BAG OUT AND TAKE THEM TO THE LAUNDROMAT
GvNqJ8T_btw_1 0 HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
GvNqJ8T_btw_2 0 WHAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT NOW IS IN ORDER FOR OUR DEFENSIVE TACKLES TO BE EFFECTIVE THEY HAVE TO HAVE A QUICK FIRE OFF AND BE THE FASTEST MAN GETTING TO THE OFFENSIVE GUY
GvNqJ8T_btw_3 0 THIS IS GOING TO BE OUR OFFENSIVE LINEMAN IN A THREE POINT STANCE VIDEO DEMO THIS IS OUR DEFENSIVE LINEMAN IN HIS THREE POINT STANCE
GvNqJ8T_btw_4 0 ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE HAS TO DO AS A DEFENDER IF HE'S NOT GOING TO USE A SPECIAL MOVE TO GET AROUND THIS GUY WITH HIS ARMS LOCKED OUT HE HAS TO KEEP THIS GUY OFF OF HIM
GvNqJ8T_btw_5 0 WE NEVER WANT THE OFFENSIVE GUY TO GET INSIDE OUR DEFENDER AND STAND HIM UP AND CONTROL WHAT'S HAPPENING
GvNqJ8T_btw_6 0 WE WANT THIS GUY OUR DEFENDER TO HAVE HIS HANDS LOCKED OUT SO HE CAN CONTROL WHERE THIS GUY'S GOING
GvNqJ8T_btw_7 0 LET'S WALK THROUGH IT VIDEO DEMO
GvNqJ8T_btw_8 0 SEE OUR DEFENDER IS KEEPING THIS GUY OUT SO HE CAN'T GET AN UNDERNEATH POSITION AND LOCK HIM OUT
GvNqJ8T_btw_9 0 THE NEXT THING HE WANTS TO DO IS TRY TO TELL THIS GUY WHERE HE'S GOING
GvNqJ8T_btw_10 0 HE WANTS TO SHED HIM THIS WAY OR SHED HIM THAT WAY
GvNqJ8T_btw_11 0 HE CAN'T DO THAT EFFECTIVELY IF HE HASN'T GOT THOSE ARMS LOCKED OUT AND HE DIDN'T FIRE UP QUICKLY AND KEEP HIM HELD OUT
gFe8e_OTItc_1 0 OKAY SO I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT SOME MATERIALS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED BEYOND THE OIL AND THE FILTERS AND THINGS THAT WILL HELP YOU
gFe8e_OTItc_2 0 JUST MAKE THE JOB OF CHANGING YOUR OIL A LOT EASIER
gFe8e_OTItc_3 0 NUMBER ONE IS GOING TO BE SOME KIND OF DRAIN PANS
gFe8e_OTItc_4 0 THESE ARE GOING TO CATCH THE OIL AS YOU'RE DRAINING THE OLD OIL OUT OF YOUR VEHICLE
gFe8e_OTItc_5 0 OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST DRAIN THE OIL ALL OVER THE YOUR DRIVEWAY OR JUST THE STREET OR WHATEVER
gFe8e_OTItc_6 0 SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU MAKE SURE YOU GET THESE OIL PANS OR SOME VERSION OF THE OIL PANS
gFe8e_OTItc_7 0 SOME THAT ARE A LITTLE MORE SELF CONTAINED THEY'LL LIKE YOU KNOW CLOSE OVER THE OIL
gFe8e_OTItc_8 0 AND YOU CAN HAVE A NICE LITTLE SPOUT THAT YOU CAN JUST POUR THE OLD OIL INTO AN OLD CONTAINER AND GO RECYCLE IT
gFe8e_OTItc_9 0 AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECYCLE YOUR OIL AT SAY THE AUTO PARTS STORE THAT YOU BOUGHT YOUR OIL
gFe8e_OTItc_10 0 SO DRAIN PANS ARE GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT
gFe8e_OTItc_11 0 ANOTHER THING I LIKE TO HAVE LYING AROUND ARE SHOP TOWELS
gFe8e_OTItc_12 0 YOU COULD ALSO USE PAPER TOWELS IT'S NOT REALLY THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE
gFe8e_OTItc_13 0 THE SHOP TOWEL'S A LITTLE THICKER AND SOAKS UP THE OIL A LITTLE BIT BETTER
gFe8e_OTItc_14 0 SO SHOP TOWELS ARE REALLY GOOD TO HAVE
gFe8e_OTItc_15 0 ALSO YOU CAN CLEAN UP A LITTLE BIT KEEP YOUR HANDS CLEAN AND THAT KIND OF STUFF
GcLxTqAwEmc_1 0 I'VE CHOSEN A PIPE CLEANER TAIL FOR THIS RAT AND WE'VE GOT TO CHOSE PLACEMENT
GcLxTqAwEmc_2 0 WE COULD HAVE IS COME RIGHT OUT THE BACK BUT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE MORE DRAMATIC IF WE HAVE IT COME RIGHT OFF THE TOP
GcLxTqAwEmc_3 0 SO THE FIRST THING WE WANT TO DO IS SHAPE OUR TAIL AND I'M THINKING THAT WE'LL GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT OF A TWIST
GcLxTqAwEmc_4 0 YOU CAN DO THAT BY WRAPPING IT AROUND YOUR FINGER AND THEN WE CAN STRAIGHTEN IT OUT ONCE WE'RE DONE
GcLxTqAwEmc_5 0 GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS WE WANT TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THIS END THE PART THAT'S GOING TO BE INSERTED
GcLxTqAwEmc_6 0 WE'VE GOT TO FIND THE RIGHT PLACE TO STICK IT IN
GcLxTqAwEmc_7 0 IF WE WANT TO CHANGE OUR MIND AND WE PULL IT BACK OUT AGAIN THAT'S OKAY BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SMOOTH OVER THAT SPOT FIX IT AND CHOOSE ANOTHER SPOT
GcLxTqAwEmc_8 0 WHEN WE PUT IT IN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT GOES IN FAR ENOUGH THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO FALL OUT BECAUSE ONCE THIS RAT IS DRY WE DON'T HAVE THE OPTION OF PUTTING IT IN AGAIN
GcLxTqAwEmc_9 0 WE CAN ALSO BEND IT AROUND WE CAN MAKE HIM LOOK LIKE A PLAYFUL RAT BRING IT OUT THIS WAY
GcLxTqAwEmc_10 0 HERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS WE COULD DO YOU COULD ALSO KEEP IT STRAIGHT IF YOU WANTED BUT I LIKE THE CURVE AND WE'LL PUT IT RIGHT OVER THE TOP

GsOSWQnkTDk_9 0 WE THEN MADE A SAUCE USING SOME GROUND BEEF TOMATO SAUCE SOME SEASONINGS SOME OREGANO BASIL ONION POWDER GARLIC SALT BLACK PEPPER
GsOSWQnkTDk_10 0 SOME BELL PEPPER SOME ONIONS GARLIC AND WE FILLED THAT SAUCE WITH THAT MADE OUR SAUCE AND LAYERED ON TO OUR CRUST
GsOSWQnkTDk_11 0 WE PUT ON OUR TOPPINGS THAT CONSISTED OF BLACK OLIVES SOME FRESH TOMATOES SOME MUSHROOMS AND WE USED A SMOKED MOZZARELLA
GsOSWQnkTDk_12 0 YOU CAN USE ANY KIND OF CHEESE YOU LIKE
GsOSWQnkTDk_13 0 AS I SAID I LIKE SMOKEY
GsOSWQnkTDk_14 0 ANOTHER OPTION YOU CAN DO OR YOU MAY CHOOSE TO DO IS WHEN YOU PUT YOUR CRUST IN TAKE A FORK AND MAKE LITTLE HOLES AROUND THE BOTTOM AND AROUND THE SIDES
GsOSWQnkTDk_15 0 YOU MAY WANT TO PUT YOUR CRUST IN THE OVEN FOR A GOOD FIVE OR TEN MINUTES AND YOU WILL GET A SOLID BOTTOM
GsOSWQnkTDk_16 0 SO ONCE YOU PUT ALL OF THIS IN THE BOTTOM IT MAY HOLD A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT WITH THIS BEING DEEP DISH IT IS MEANT TO BE EATEN WITH A FORK ON A PLATE NOT LIFTED UP
GsOSWQnkTDk_17 0 THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT A NEW YORK STYLE PIZZA
GsOSWQnkTDk_18 0 YOU ARE NOT GOING TO FOLD IT IN HALF
GsOSWQnkTDk_19 0 GOING TO PUT IT ON A PLATE AND JUST EAT IT AND ENJOY IT
GsOSWQnkTDk_20 0 ANYWAY HERE WE GO NOW A DEEP-DISH BISCUIT CRUST PIZZA
HH5pjV9ypFk_2 0 I'M ROSS ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
HH5pjV9ypFk_3 0 LET'S TALK ABOUT CONSUMER CAMCORDERS
HH5pjV9ypFk_4 0 WHAT IS THE RECORD LAMP
HH5pjV9ypFk_5 0 YOU CAN SEE IT IT'S LIT UP
HH5pjV9ypFk_6 0 IT'S CALLED THE TALLY LIGHT
HH5pjV9ypFk_7 0 THE CONSUMER CAMCORDERS ARE CALLING IT RECORD LIGHT IN A LOT OF CASES
HH5pjV9ypFk_8 0 I KNOW IT AS THE TALLY LIGHT AND THIS LIGHT TELLS YOU THAT THE CAMERA IS RECORDING
HH5pjV9ypFk_9 0 WELL I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO GO TO TURN IT OFF ESPECIALLY WHEN I USED TO HAVE MY TWO PIECE VHS RECORDER
HH5pjV9ypFk_10 0 BECAUSE AS SOON AS THAT LIGHT CAME ON PEOPLE ACTED STRANGE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN THE PICTURE
HH5pjV9ypFk_11 0 NOW MAY BE THAT'S NOT AS COMMON THESE DAYS BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF CAMCORDERS AROUND BUT YOU CAN GO INTO YOUR MENU GO DOWN IN THIS CASE TO RECORD LAMP AND CHANGE THE STATE OF IT TO OFF AND THEN CHANGE IT BACK TO ON AND SO THAT WAY YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND RECORD WITHOUT PEOPLE KNOWING IF YOU ARE OR ARE NOT
HH5pjV9ypFk_12 0 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST PEOPLE DO USE THE TALLY LIGHT THIS ONE IS RECORDING NOW BUT NO TALLY LIGHT
HH5pjV9ypFk_13 0 SO MOST PEOPLE THINK YOU ARE NOT RECORDING IT WORKS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE
g_p-YsZuuvQ_1 0 SO YOU JUST BOUGHT YOUR FIRST HARLEY
g_p-YsZuuvQ_2 0 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
g_p-YsZuuvQ_3 0 YOU GOTTA GET A JACKET
g_p-YsZuuvQ_5 0 SO YOU WANT TO ADD SOME PATCHES TO THE NEW CLUB THAT YOU JUST JOINED
g_p-YsZuuvQ_6 0 LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ADDING PATCHES TO MOTORCYCLE JACKETS
g_p-YsZuuvQ_7 0 HI MY NAME IS DANIEL KING
g_p-YsZuuvQ_8 0 I'M A DESIGNER AND PATTERN MAKER AND I'M JUST GOING TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN DO TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR MOTORCYCLE JACKET
g_p-YsZuuvQ_9 0 I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE ON FABRIC HERE
g_p-YsZuuvQ_10 0 AND MAYBE IT'S A DENIM JACKET YOU'RE GOING TO START WITH BEFORE YOU GO TO LEATHER
g_p-YsZuuvQ_11 0 OF COURSE WITH LEATHER YOU'LL NEED A LITTLE MORE HEAVY DUTY NEEDLE AND THREAD
g_p-YsZuuvQ_12 0 IT SEWS JUST A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE PATIENCE WITH THAT
g_p-YsZuuvQ_13 0 BUT ON FABRIC YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOUR PATCH
g_p-YsZuuvQ_14 0 AND TYPICALLY IT'S GOING TO BE A PATCH THAT'S ALREADY BEEN PRE PRE-PURCHASED PRE-MADE
g_p-YsZuuvQ_15 0 SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE RAW EDGES ON IT
g_p-YsZuuvQ_16 0 YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR NEEDLE AND THREAD AND I'M GOING TO TAKE YOUR NEEDLE AND COME THROUGH THE ACTUAL FABRIC HERE TO ANCHOR IT
g_p-YsZuuvQ_17 0 WHEN I ANCHOR IT THEN I'M GOING TO START TO GO UNDERNEATH THE PATCH ITSELF AND THEN THROUGH THE VERY EDGE OF THE PATCH
g_p-YsZuuvQ_18 0 BRING THAT UP
g_p-YsZuuvQ_19 0 PULL IT THROUGH
g_p-YsZuuvQ_20 0 MAKE SURE IT'S ANCHORED
g_p-YsZuuvQ_21 0 AND I MIGHT DO IT ONCE OR TWICE RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING SO IT'S SECURE
g_p-YsZuuvQ_22 0 YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SECURE THE BEGINNING AND THE END WHERE YOU START AND FINISH TO SEW
g_p-YsZuuvQ_23 0 THEN I JUST KEEP GOING UNDERNEATH AND CATCHING THE FABRIC OR THE LEATHER AND THEN COMING THROUGH THE TOP OF THE PATCH ITSELF
g_p-YsZuuvQ_24 0 AND JUST KEEP COMING THROUGH
g_p-YsZuuvQ_25 0 AND GO ALL THE WAY AROUND THE PATCH TO BE SURE THAT IT'S ALL SECURE BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE RIDING DOWN THE HIGHWAY YOU DON'T WANT THAT PATCH FLYING OFF
g_p-YsZuuvQ_26 0 MY NAME IS DANIEL KING
g_p-YsZuuvQ_27 0 AND HAVE A GREAT TRIP ON THAT CYCLE
gd1NCFaCODg_1 0 DUSTING BIG SCREEN TV'S IS AN EASY JOB
gd1NCFaCODg_2 0 HOWEVER IF YOU DUST IT AND IT HAS DIRT ACCUMULATED ON IT
gd1NCFaCODg_3 0 WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS IT SCRATCH YOUR SCREEN
gd1NCFaCODg_4 0 SO MAKE SURE THAT SCREEN IS CLEAN
gd1NCFaCODg_5 0 THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO GET A VERY SOFT CLOTH WITH VINEGAR AND WATER
gd1NCFaCODg_6 0 MAKE SURE YOU SPRAY THE MIXTURE DIRECTLY ON THE CLOTH NOT ON THE SCREEN
gd1NCFaCODg_7 0 WIPE IT CLEAN
gd1NCFaCODg_8 0 ESPECIALLY IN THE CORNERS TOP AND BACK AND WHERE THE DUST ACCUMULATES
gd1NCFaCODg_9 0 THEN TO KEEP THE DUST FROM GOING ON TO THE SCREEN YOU ARE GOING TO GET A DRYER SHEET IF IT'S FRAGRANCED THAT'S EVEN BETTER
gd1NCFaCODg_10 0 WIPE IT ON THE SCREEN
gd1NCFaCODg_11 0 THEN BUFF THE SCREEN AND IT WILL KEEP DUST FROM ACCUMULATING ON THE SCREEN FOR A WHILE
gd1NCFaCODg_12 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE THE DRYER SHEET TRICK ON YOUR BLINDS
g9wzKPxdcLQ_1 0 HI I'M JASON SHOEMAKER AT SLUG FEST PRINTMAKING WORKSHOP AND I'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PAPER PREPARATION FOR INTAGLIO PRINT MAKING
g9wzKPxdcLQ_2 0 IN INTAGLIO PRINT MAKING YOU'RE ACTUALLY PUSHING PAPER DOWN INTO THE CREVICES OF THE PRINTING MATRIX AND PULLING THE INK OUT OF THERE
g9wzKPxdcLQ_3 0 SO IT'S NECESSARY TO HAVE THE PAPER A LITTLE MORE MALLEABLE THAN IT IS WHEN IT'S DRY
g9wzKPxdcLQ_4 0 SOAKING IT IN WATER HELPS THAT
g9wzKPxdcLQ_5 0 IT ALSO HELPS TO TAKE SOME OF THE EXTRA STARCH AND THE BINDING AGENTS THAT WERE PUT IN THE PAPER WHEN IT WAS MADE
g9wzKPxdcLQ_6 0 SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO PRIOR TO PRINTING IS HAVE A WATER BATH
g9wzKPxdcLQ_7 0 PUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED FOR HOWEVER MUCH YOU'RE GOING TO PRINT SET IT IN WATER AND LET IT SOAK
g9wzKPxdcLQ_8 0 USUALLY JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES IS FINE
g9wzKPxdcLQ_9 0 I USUALLY SET IT UP AND THEN GO SET UP THE PRESS AND YOU KNOW START INKING UP THE PLATES AND THEN BY THAT TIME IT'S USUALLY GOOD
g9wzKPxdcLQ_10 0 WHEN YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY GET THE PAPER OUT IF YOUR HANDS ARE DIRTY FROM INKING TONGS ARE VERY HANDY
g9wzKPxdcLQ_11 0 YOU COULD ALSO JUST REACH IN THERE AND GRAB IT
g9wzKPxdcLQ_12 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO PULL IT LET THE EXTRA WATER DRAIN OFF
g9wzKPxdcLQ_13 0 ONCE THAT'S DONE WE HAVE A TOWEL HERE WHICH IS GOING TO GET MORE OF THE EXCESS SURFACE WATER OUT
g9wzKPxdcLQ_14 0 YOU JUST WANT THE WATER DOWN INTO THE PAPER AND THERE ISN'T MUCH THERE TO START WITH
g9wzKPxdcLQ_15 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE BLOTTER PAPER WHICH IS JUST A REALLY THICK ABSORBENT PAPER
g9wzKPxdcLQ_16 0 TOWELS WORK GOOD IF IT'S JUST A SMALL SHOP
g9wzKPxdcLQ_17 0 ROLLING PINS WORK TO ACTUALLY RUN OVER THE PAPER WHAT IT CAN DO IS CREATE CREASES IN THE PAPER
g9wzKPxdcLQ_18 0 I'M USUALLY IN TOO MUCH OF A HURRY SO I'LL JUST USE MY FOREARM AND JUST GO ACROSS LIKE THAT
g9wzKPxdcLQ_19 0 AND THAT IS PLENTY
g9wzKPxdcLQ_20 0 ONCE THAT'S DONE YOU PULL THE PAPER OFF AND IF YOU SEE ANY WATER PUDDLING UP ON THE SURFACE JUST GO AHEAD AND DO THAT PROCESS OVER AGAIN BUT IF IT LOOKS GOOD NICE AND EVEN THERE'S A LITTLE MOISTURE IN IT YOU'RE READY TO GO
G-zIFIpqW3s_1 0 THIS IS JAKE WITH EXPERT VILLAGE TELLING YOU A FEW TIPS ON CAPTURING AND TURNING YOUR HOME VIDEOS TO EITHER ON LINE OR DVDS
G-zIFIpqW3s_2 0 NOW ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS YOU WANT TO DO NOW THIS PARTICULAR BOX IN ADOBE PREMIER SO IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH PREMIER THEN THIS WOULD MAKE IT A LOT EASIER
G-zIFIpqW3s_3 0 NOW FOR INSTANCE HERE IS A QUICK TIME FILE YOU HAVE TONS AND TONS OF OPTIONS HERE WHEN YOU ARE INSIDE A PREMIER INTO YOUR QUICK TIME FILES

G-zIFIpqW3s_6 0 I WILL HAVE NO CODING TASK I WOULD JUST LEAVE IT AS IT IS
G-zIFIpqW3s_7 0 ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE NEW TO HOME VIDEO
G-zIFIpqW3s_8 0 NOW ON THIS PARTICULAR THING YOU CAN HAVE A LOOP YOU CAN HAVE SPECIFIC THINGS AGAIN KEEP IT DEFAULT KEEP IT SIMPLE
GL1aNimfMxs_1 0 THE FIRST THING WE ARE GOING TO DO IS EXPLORE WHAT EMOTIONS ARE REALLY ALL ABOUT
GL1aNimfMxs_2 0 EMOTIONS ARE ENERGY IN MOTION
GL1aNimfMxs_3 0 THEY ARE ACTUALLY CHEMICAL REACTIONS IN THE BODY AND WHAT WE NOW KNOW IS THAT WE HAVE OVER 27 DIFFERENT EMOTIONAL REACTIONS EVERY WAKING HOUR OF EVERY DAY
GL1aNimfMxs_4 0 NOW THAT IS A LOT OF EMOTIONS RUNNING THROUGH MOST OF US ON A DAILY BASIS AND THOSE EMOTIONS HAPPEN WHEN SOMETHING CAUSES CONNECTS WITH OUR ENERGY AND CAUSES THAT CHEMICAL RESPONSE
GL1aNimfMxs_5 0 THIS LITTLE ENERGY BALL IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT
GL1aNimfMxs_6 0 IT'S GOT TWO TERMINALS ON IT AND IF I ONLY TOUCH ONE NOTHING HAPPENS
GL1aNimfMxs_7 0 BUT THE MOMENT I TOUCH THE OTHER TERMINAL WE NOW HAVE LIGHT AND SOUNDS
GL1aNimfMxs_8 0 THAT SAME THING IS WHAT CAUSES EMOTIONS TO HAPPEN TO US
GL1aNimfMxs_9 0 SOMETHING HAPPENS IN OUR WORLD IT CONNECTS WITH US THE ENERGY FLOWS AND WE HAD EMOTION ENERGY IN MOTION
GL1aNimfMxs_10 0 NOW WHAT HAPPENS FOR ALMOST EVERYBODY I'VE EVERY MET IF YOU'VE GOT A BELLY BUTTON I THINK IT APPLIES TO YOU IS THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCES IN OUR LIVES WHERE EMOTIONS FOR WHATEVER REASON ARE PAINFUL
GL1aNimfMxs_11 0 WE HAVE AN UPSET FOR WHATEVER THAT HAPPENS IN OUR LIVES AND LET'S SAY YOU ARE A LITTLE KID AND DAD YELLS AT YOU AND YOU YELL BACK AND DAD SLAPS YOU IN THE FACE AND SAYS DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT AND YOU GO OH BETTER NOT FEEL THAT EMOTION
GL1aNimfMxs_12 0 NOW NOT AS MUCH ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH THE PIPE WHICH IS LIKE OUR BODY
GL1aNimfMxs_13 0 OR WE ARE FEELING SAD BECAUSE OUR PUPPY DOG DIED AND SO WE DON'T WANT TO FEEL THAT SADNESS ANY MORE STOP CRYING OR I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO CRY ABOUT AND WE PUT SOME MORE STUFFING IN THE PIPE AND EVEN LESS EMOTION FLOWS THROUGH
GL1aNimfMxs_14 0 OR PERHAPS WE ARE FEELING SCARED ABOUT SOMETHING AND SOMEONE SAYS OH YOU'RE A BIG KID GROW UP YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL SCARED ABOUT THAT AND YOU GO OH I SHOULDN'T FEEL SCARED AND WE PUT ANOTHER ONE IN
GL1aNimfMxs_15 0 THEN EVEN WITH GLAD SOMETIMES IS THAT WE'RE TOLD YOU KNOW CHILDREN SHOULD BE SEEN AND NOT HOLD PIPE DOWN YOU'RE MAKING TOO MUCH NOISE QUITE HAVING SO MUCH FUN IN THERE OR SOMETHING HAPPENS WHEN WE ARE HAVING FUN THAT IS HURTFUL AND PAINFUL AND WE PUT THAT IN THE PIPE
GL1aNimfMxs_16 0 THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW THERE'S NO ROOM FOR THE ENERGY IN MOTION TO FLOW THROUGH THE PIPE
GL1aNimfMxs_17 0 THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TO US
GL1aNimfMxs_18 0 WHEN THAT HAPPENS SOMETHING WILL CAUSE THOSE EMOTIONS TO EXPLODE
GL1aNimfMxs_19 0 SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN DO WHEN THOSE EMOTIONS EXPLODE ESPECIALLY THE EMOTION OF ANGER

hi0pfXXVMhw_2 0 MY NAME IS RICHARD RIVAS CO-OWNER OF BLACK JUNGLE TERRARIUM SUPPLY AND TODAY I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM TO DISCUSS THE PROPER WAY OF RAISING YOUR POISON DART FROGS FROM THE EGG THROUGH THE TADPOLE STAGE
hi0pfXXVMhw_3 0 ONCE THE TADPOLES HAVE BEEN PLACED INTO THE BIN THE NEXT STEP IS TO LABEL THEM
hi0pfXXVMhw_4 0 USING A PIECE OF MASKIN TAPE WE THEN WRITE OUT THE SPECIES NAME AND THE DATE THEY HATCHED AND APPLY THAT TO THE CONTAINER
hi0pfXXVMhw_5 0 WE ALSO WRITE THE NUMBER OF TADPOLES IN THE CONTAINER
hi0pfXXVMhw_6 0 HERE AT BLACK JUNGLE WE ACTUALLY RAISE VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR DENDROBATES COMMUNALLY
hi0pfXXVMhw_7 0 EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE CANNIBALISTIC OR CAN BE CANNIBALISTIC WE HAVE FOUND THAT THEY DO MUCH BETTER IN LARGER VOLUMES OF WATER INSTEAD OF DOING THEM IN INDIVIDUAL CUPS AND AS LONG AS THEY ARE WELL FED LOSSES ARE DEFINITELY KEPT TO A MINIMUM
hi0pfXXVMhw_8 0 USUALLY ANY LOSSES THAT WE DO EXPERIENCE COME FROM WEAK TADPOLES THAT ARE JUST NOT DEVELOPING NORMALLY ANY WAY
hi0pfXXVMhw_9 0 RARELY DO WE EVER HAVE ANY INSTANCES OF MISSING TOES OR LEGS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
hi0pfXXVMhw_10 0 AS LONG AS THEY ARE WELL CARED FOR THEY SEEM TO DO JUST FINE
hi0pfXXVMhw_11 0 THE ONLY SPECIES THAT WE DO KEEP INDIVIDUALLY ARE SOME OF THE THUMBNAIL SPECIES
hi0pfXXVMhw_12 0 IN THIS INSTANCE HERE WE HAVE A DENDROBATES RETICULATUS
hi0pfXXVMhw_13 0 THESE GUYS WE TYPICALLY DO JUST KEEP IN THE 32 OUNCE INSECT CULTURING CONTAINERS
hi0pfXXVMhw_14 0 ALL OF THEM ARE KEPT INDIVIDUALLY JUST TO AVOID ANY POTENTIAL LOSSES MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEIR BREEDING IS FAR MORE LIMITED THAN THE LARGER DENDROBATES SPECIES
hijRv6opROw_1 0 HI IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT BELLY DANCE MEANS TO ME AND HOW I PRACTICE IT

HBJ-oee19vM_3 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT REMOVAL OF A COUPLE OF BRAKE COMPONENTS IN ORDER TO PERFORM OUR BALL JOINT SERVICE
HBJ-oee19vM_4 0 THIS BEING THAT THE BRAKING SYSTEM IS HYDRAULICALLY CONNECTED TO THE REST OF THE SUSPENSION AND IN A WAY FOR THE MOST PART WE'RE GOING TO DISASSEMBLE THE CALIPER GRID AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO COMPRESS THE PISTON IN THE CALIPER
HBJ-oee19vM_5 0 IN ORDER FOR PISTON COMPRESSING WE'RE GOING TO USE A FLAT BED SCREWDRIVER I'M GOING TO INSERT IT THROUGH ONE OF THE INSPECTION SLOTS AND PRY AGAINST THE SURFACE OF THE ROTOR
HBJ-oee19vM_6 0 NOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF ROOM IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO SLIP THE PADS OFF THAT RIGHT THERE IS PLENTY AS YOU CAN SEE I GOT THE CALIPER TO MOVE A LITTLE BIT
HBJ-oee19vM_7 0 I'M GOING TO TAKE MY THREE INCH SOCKET WRENCH WITH A THIRTEEN MILLIMETER SOCKET AND TAKE THE MOUNTING BOLTS LOOSE FOR THE CALIPER
HBJ-oee19vM_8 0 THIS IS YOUR UPPER CALIPER MOUNTING BOLT

HBJ-oee19vM_12 0 THIS ONE HAPPENS TO TAKE A SOCKET
HBJ-oee19vM_13 0 GO AHEAD AND BREAK IT LOOSE AND UNSCREW IT

HBJ-oee19vM_15 0 ALRIGHT AND THERE IS OUR CALIPER MOUNTING BOLT
HBJ-oee19vM_16 0 ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THE FASTENERS OUT ON YOUR VEHICLE YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND WIGGLE YOUR CALIPER OFF JUST LIKE SO

HBJ-oee19vM_18 0 AND THAT IS THE PROPER WAY TO REMOVE YOUR CALIPER AND BRAKE PADS

gLGaCS3wLxQ_3 0 IF YOU WANT TO WATCH ALL THE PICKS FOR THE DRAFT YOU CAN DEFINITELY DO THAT
gLGaCS3wLxQ_4 0 IF THERE IS A PLAYER THAT YOU'VE SCOUTED LETS SAY I'VE SCOUTED TEN PLAYERS AND I JUST DRAFTED THAT QUARTERBACK LETS SAY THAT HE WAS THE ONE GUY THAT I REALLY WANTED BUT LETS SAY THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER PICK MAYBE IN THE FIRST ROUND THAT I REALLY REALLY WANTED BECAUSE MY NEXT PICK ISN'T GOING TO BE UNTIL THE SEVENTH PICK IN THE SECOND ROUND
gLGaCS3wLxQ_5 0 SO LETS SAY THAT THERE WAS A TOP TEN PICK OR A FIRST ROUND PICK THAT I REALLY WANTED I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND DO THAT TRADE THAT WE HAD ALREADY TALKED ABOUT
gLGaCS3wLxQ_6 0 BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO IF YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S NOT A PLAYER COMING UP THAT YOU REALLY WANT OR REALLY NEED WHAT'S GOING TO GET YOU THROUGH THIS DRAFT IS HIT THIS R B BUTTON
gLGaCS3wLxQ_7 0 YOUR R BUMPER THEY CALL IT AND THAT WILL JUST SIMULATE US TO OUR NEXT USER PICK AND WE'LL JUST CLICK A THERE AND IT'S GOING TO GO THROUGH ALL THE PICKS FOR THE FIRST ROUND
gLGaCS3wLxQ_8 0 IT WILL STOP IF THERE'S A TRADE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
gLGaCS3wLxQ_9 0 IT'S A WAY TO SAVE YOU TIME FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR EACH PICK IS PRETTY AWFUL SO
gLGaCS3wLxQ_10 0 NOW WE'RE IN OUR SECOND ROUND AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO SEE WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE AND I NEED JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING

gLGaCS3wLxQ_12 0 THERE'S ALSO A COUPLE OF REALLY GOOD WIDE RECEIVERS UP HERE AND I PICKED UP THAT WIDE RECEIVER IN FREE AGENCY I ALSO HAVE A REALLY GOOD WIDE RECEIVER
gLGaCS3wLxQ_13 0 BUT IF I HAVE IF I PICKED UP A QUARTERBACK I WANT TO GIVE HIM SOME WEAPONS TO THROW TO AND IT LOOKS LIKE OUR BEST OPTIONS RIGHT NOW ARE STILL ON THE OFFENSIVE SIDE AND THIS GUY RUNS A 4.29
gLGaCS3wLxQ_14 0 HE'S AN ABSOLUTE BURNER
gLGaCS3wLxQ_15 0 HE WAS PROJECTED THAT HE MIGHT POSSIBLY GO IN THE FIRST ROUND SO I KNOW HE'S A PRETTY GOOD PLAYER AND I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PICK HIM NEXT
gawUqHre0_4_1 0 OK ONE LAST THING WE NEED TO PUT ON THE FACE OF OUR BABY IS OUR MOUTH
gawUqHre0_4_2 0 I USUALLY LIKE TO DO A SMILE
gawUqHre0_4_3 0 YOU'LL NEED A LENGTH OF THREAD I ALWAYS DOUBLE MINE OVER ABOUT THAT LONG
gawUqHre0_4_4 0 IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO DOUBLE IT AND THEN JUST KNOT IT ON THE END BECAUSE IT JUST MAKES IT STRONGER
gawUqHre0_4_5 0 IF YOU'RE NOT CONFIDENT ON IT FEEL FREE TO PENCIL IT IN
gawUqHre0_4_6 0 I TEND TO JUST KIND OF THROW MINE ON BECAUSE IF IT'S A CROOKED SMILE I THINK THAT'S OK
gawUqHre0_4_7 0 BUT WHAT I DO IS JUST GO AHEAD AND WORK YOUR WAY ACROSS AND I USUALLY GO AHEAD AND LEAVE THOSE GAPS IN BETWEEN BECAUSE THEN WHEN I GET TO THE END I TURN AROUND AND GO BACK OVER THE SPOTS THAT ARE LEFT OPEN AND SO IT MAKES FOR A CONSTANT LINE BUT THAT WAY YOU'RE NOT PULLING OUT YOUR OTHER STITCHES WHEREAS IF YOU TRIED TO DO IT THE OTHER WAY THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
gawUqHre0_4_8 0 IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TRYING TO COME UP RIGHT WHERE YOUR OTHER STITCH WAS SO IT LOOKS NICE AND EVEN
gawUqHre0_4_10 0 NOW OBVIOUSLY YOU'LL BE DOING THIS ON YOUR RAG DOLL MOUTH NOT ON A SCRATCH PIECE OR A SCRAP PIECE OF MATERIAL AND YOU'LL GET SOMETHING LIKE THIS OR IF THIS WAS MY MORE CROOKED ONE THAT I DID IN A JIFFY BUT THEY ALL WORK JUST FINE
HC8S4IV3KJw_1 0 SOME OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE DON'T GIVE MUCH THOUGHT TO BEFORE THEY GO OUT IN THE FIELD IS HOW THEY ARE GOING TO HANDLE AN ENCOUNTER WITH ANOTHER HUNTER OR A LAW OFFICER IN THE FIELD
HC8S4IV3KJw_2 0 AND REALLY THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE IT IN MY OPINION IS TO GREET HIM WITH OPEN ARMS TREAT EVERYONE WITH A TYPE OF RESPECT THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE TREATED WITH AND AND YOU ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE IF YOU DO THAT
HC8S4IV3KJw_3 0 TREAT THE LAW OFFICER WITH RESPECT AND ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS TRUTHFULLY DON'T BE DISRESPECTFUL AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN A LOT BETTER SHAPE
HC8S4IV3KJw_4 0 IF YOU HAPPEN TO RUN INTO ANYONE LIKE THAT
HC8S4IV3KJw_5 0 AND I SAY ANYONE LIKE THAT MEANING A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER
HC8S4IV3KJw_6 0 YOU ARE NOT GOING TO WIN AN ARGUMENT WITH A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER SO THERE IS REALLY NO SENSE IN DISAGREEING WITH HIM
HC8S4IV3KJw_7 0 MANY TIMES WHEN PUSHED INTO A SITUATION IF THEY ARE DEALING WITH SOMEONE WHO IS BEING OBSTINATE IF YOU WILL THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM A TICKET WHERE WHEN THEY ARE DEALING WITH SOMEONE WHO IS BEING COOPERATIVE AND THEY PERHAPS DON'T COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE RULES FOR YOUR PARTICULAR STATE OR REGION THAT OFFICER CAN WILL MANY TIMES GIVE YOU A BREAK ON THAT AND ONLY GIVE YOU A WARNING WHICH IS REALLY A NICE THING
HC8S4IV3KJw_8 0 WE ALWAYS WANT TO FOLLOW THE LAWS AND BE FAMILIAR WITH THE LAWS GOVERNING OUR STATE AND OUR HUNTING LOCATION

H1kqxDOVFSY_3 0 YOU PULL BACK AND EXPOSE THE BOLT AND SLIDE THE COVER UP THE ACTUAL CABLE ASSEMBLY ON IT AND YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD ACCESSIBILITY TO THE BOLT
H1kqxDOVFSY_5 0 I WANT TO BREAK IT FREE FIRST WITH A RATCHET SO I HAD MORE TORQUE

GL0jG3gy4rk_1 0 HI MY NAME IS LAUREN AND TODAY I'M HERE TO DISCUSS HOW MUCH MONEY DOES A PERMANENT HAIR STRAIGHTENING COST
GL0jG3gy4rk_2 0 THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF STRAIGHTENERS THAT YOU CAN DO AT THIS POINT
GL0jG3gy4rk_3 0 YOU HAVE YOUR RELAXER WHICH SIMPLY SOFTENS YOUR NATURAL CURL AND RELAXES IT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO BLOW YOUR OWN HAIR OUT AND IN ORDER TO MANAGE YOUR CURL
GL0jG3gy4rk_4 0 THE RELAXER CAN BRING FROM A KINKY CURL INTO A BIT OF A SOFTER CURL
GL0jG3gy4rk_5 0 IT CAN ALSO TRY TO HELP YOU ACHIEVE THAT STRAIGHT HOWEVER THE RELAXER WILL MORE OF LESS DO MORE OF A RELAXATION ON YOUR CURL AND NOT NECESSARILY STRAIGHTEN IT
GL0jG3gy4rk_6 0 USUALLY YOUR RELAXERS RUN ABOUT ANYWHERE FROM SIXTY FIVE TO EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS IN ORDER TO PUT THE RELAXER ON
GL0jG3gy4rk_7 0 IN ORDER TO HAVE THE PROCESSING PLUS PRODUCT
GL0jG3gy4rk_8 0 IT DOES NOT TAKE TOO LONG IT'D PROBABLY BE ABOUT AN HOUR IN ENTIRE PROCESSING TIME AND IT WOULD COST A LITTLE BIT LESS
GL0jG3gy4rk_9 0 THE MORE EXPENSIVE THERMO-STRAIGHTENERS WOULD BE MORE OR LESS YOUR JAPANESE STRAIGHTENING OR YOUR IONIC STRAIGHTENERS
GL0jG3gy4rk_10 0 THE PROCESS FOR THAT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME CONSUMING AND A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU GO THROUGH WITH A STRAIGHT IRON AND STRAIGHTEN THE HAIR AFTER YOU PROCESS IT
GL0jG3gy4rk_11 0 AND THEN YOU NEUTRALIZE THAT HAIR WITH THAT STRAIGHTENER
GL0jG3gy4rk_12 0 THIS PROCESS CAN TAKE ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO FIVE HOURS
GL0jG3gy4rk_13 0 IT'S GOING TO BE MORE COSTLY BUT DEFINITELY MORE EFFECTIVE IN GETTING KINKY CURLY HAIR INTO A LOT STRAIGHTER HAIRSTYLE
GL0jG3gy4rk_14 0 SO GIVE OR TAKE YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING ANYWHERE FROM SIXTY FIVE AND THEN WORK YOUR WAY UP DEPENDING ON YOUR HAIR DENSITY YOUR HAIR LENGTH AND WHERE YOU ACTUALLY GO
GL0jG3gy4rk_15 0 WHAT SPA SALON WHERE YOU'RE LOCAL STYLIST IS AND HOW MUCH THEY ARE CHARGING
GL0jG3gy4rk_16 0 AND THAT IS HOW MUCH A HAIR STRAIGHTENERS COST
GScDCFuikT0_1 0 HI MELODY AGAIN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GScDCFuikT0_2 0 I'M FOLDING CLOTHES TODAY TO MAKE THEM GO INTO A SUITCASE AND TRY AND KEEP THEM SOMEWHAT WRINKLE FREE
GScDCFuikT0_3 0 WE HAVE SOME CLOTHES HERE THAT ARE ACTUALLY SORT OF WRINKLED TO BEGIN WITH SO POSSIBLY WHEN THEY GET TO WHERE THEY'RE GOING THEY WON'T BE WRINKLED ANYMORE IF WE FOLD THEM PROPERLY
GScDCFuikT0_4 0 UM THIS IS A MAN'S SHIRT WITH SHORT SLEEVES AND THE FIRST THING I DO IS GO FOR THE CORNERS OF THE SHOULDERS AND THEN I FOLD IT TOWARDS ITS BACK AND I PUT MY FINGER IN THE COLLAR PULL THE COLLAR UP GRAB FOR THE TOP PARTS OF THE SLEEVES AND TRY AND SHAKE IT OUT A LITTLE BIT AND THEN I LAY IT DOWN ON A FLAT SURFACE AND I TRY AND FIND WHERE THERE'S SOME PROBLEM AREAS WITH WRINKLES AND I STRETCH IT OUT SO THAT THE UNDER ARM PIT SEAMS ARE TOGETHER AND THE SIDES ARE TOGETHER AND THAT THE TAIL IS STRAIGHT JUST TO TRY AND PREVENT CREATING NEW WRINKLES
GScDCFuikT0_5 0 I TAKE THE ARMS AND I'LL FOLD THEM INWARD AND I'VE GOT MY HAND IN THERE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO CREATE A BIG CREASE IN THERE WHERE I'M FOLDING I WANT IT TO FOLD STRAIGHT AND FLAT AND AS YOU CAN SEE I'M MAKING A LITTLE BIT OF MARGIN USING HERE'S THE ARMPIT AND THIS WOULD BE YOUR SIDE OR FLANK OF THE SHIRT AND I'M PULLING IT TOWARDS THE MIDDLE THERE AND NOW WHAT I WOULD DO IN THIS CASE WOULD BE TAKE THE TAIL BRING IT UP AGAINST MAKING SURE I'M NOT CREATING NEW CREASES I'D PULL IT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE COLLAR SO THAT THE COLLAR HAS SOMETHING TO PROTECT IT ITS NOT JUST HANGING OUT THERE IN THE BREEZE BY ITSELF
GScDCFuikT0_6 0 AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THIS IN THIS CASE THIS IS A VERY THIN MATERIAL AND ITS MAKING A NICE FLAT LITTLE PACKAGE AND IT COULD BE DONE JUST LIKE THIS ANOTHER WAY TO DO THIS MIGHT BE TO FOLD IT AGAIN BUT THAT WOULD BE UP TO YOU AND THE SIZE OF THE SPACE YOU HAVE IN YOUR SUITCASE
GScDCFuikT0_7 0 IN THE NEXT SEGMENT I'LL BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO FOLD ANOTHER PIECE OF CLOTHING TO GO INTO A SUITCASE
GJrc-igSJX4_1 0 YOU KNOW AN IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR GAME HAS GOT TO BE THE BALL HANDLING
GJrc-igSJX4_2 0 AND WHENEVER YOU'RE DOING THAT BALL HANDLING YOU'VE GOT TO DO DRILLS AND PRACTICE IN ORDER TO GET GOOD AT IT
GJrc-igSJX4_3 0 HI I'M TRAVIS AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU JUST HOW TO PERFECT AND GET BETTER AT BALL HANDLING IN SEVEN MINUTES A DAY

GJrc-igSJX4_10 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET A GOOD FEEL FOR THE BALL SO YOU TIP THE BALL BACK AND FORTH RAISE IT UP HIGHER AND HIGHER
GJrc-igSJX4_11 0 TRY THAT FOR LET'S SAY THIRTY SECONDS
GJrc-igSJX4_12 0 THEN TAKE MAYBE A COUPLE SECONDS REST AND ON TOP OF THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO THE NEXT THE NEXT REP MIGHT BE A LITTLE SHORTER BECAUSE YOUR ARMS WILL OBVIOUSLY BE TIRED
GJrc-igSJX4_13 0 SO TRY THAT NEXT REP LET'S SAY YOU GIVE YOURSELF TEN SECONDS REST TRY THAT NEXT REP FOR TWENTY SECONDS
GJrc-igSJX4_14 0 DO THIS FOR TWENTY SECONDS GIVE YOURSELF ONCE YOU STOP GIVE YOURSELF THAT LITTLE REST THEN MOVE ONTO THE NEXT DRILL
GJrc-igSJX4_15 0 NEXT DRILL WILL BE FOR BALL HANDLING ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF BALL HANDLING IS DRIBBLING
GJrc-igSJX4_16 0 SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO WORK ON YOUR CROSSOVER DRIBBLE
GJrc-igSJX4_17 0 SO JUST CROSSOVER DRIBBLE BACK FORTH BACK FORTH BACK AND FORTH AND YOU DO THAT FOR AROUND THIRTY SECONDS
GJrc-igSJX4_18 0 GET FASTER AND FASTER AND LOWER AND LOWER
GJrc-igSJX4_19 0 THE LOWER YOU GET THE BETTER YOU ARE AT IT
GJrc-igSJX4_20 0 THE BETTER YOU ARE AT IT THE LOWER YOU GET
GJrc-igSJX4_21 0 NOW AFTER YOU DO TWO REPS OF THAT FOR THIRTY SECONDS YOU MOVE ONTO THE NEXT ONE
GJrc-igSJX4_22 0 THE NEXT ONE WILL BE THE FIGURE EIGHT DRILL WHICH YOU GO BETWEEN YOUR LEGS FIGURE EIGHT TRY THAT WAY AND THEN REVERSE IT AND GO THE OTHER WAY THIRTY SECONDS A PIECE
GJrc-igSJX4_23 0 THE NEXT ONE WILL BE PROBABLY FIGURE EIGHT DRIBBLE WHICH TAKE THE BALL DRIBBLE BETWEEN YOUR LEGS IN THE SAME MOTION
GJrc-igSJX4_24 0 TRY IT ONE WAY AND THEN GO BACK THE OTHER DIRECTION
GJrc-igSJX4_25 0 SO YOU CAN COME UP WITH A COUPLE OF OTHER DRILLS FOR EXAMPLE INSTEAD OF THE TAP DRILL SQUEEZING IT
GJrc-igSJX4_26 0 TRY THAT THIRTY SECONDS ONE WAY AND THIRTY SECONDS AGAIN FOR THE FINISH UP REP AND THE LAST ONE YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO TRY AND JUST GET ONE ONE BALL MAYBE HAVE A DEFENSIVE MAN AND WORK ON SIMPLY DRIBBLING

HHoBh29dwts_11 0 IF YOU KEEP YOUR FEET AND POINT TO DOWNSTREAM YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO GET A FOOT ENTRAPMENT
HHoBh29dwts_12 0 A FOOT ENTRAPMENT CAN END YOUR DAY PRETTY QUICKLY
HHoBh29dwts_13 0 A FOOT ENTRAPMENT HAPPENS WHEN YOU STAND UP IN THE RIVER LIKE I'M STANDING UP NOW BUT I'D BE IN MOVING CURRENT AND MY FOOT THERE'S A ROCK RIGHT HERE GET STUCK UNDERNEATH THE ROCK
HHoBh29dwts_14 0 THEN THE FORCE OF THE CURRENT PUSHES ME OVER LIKE SO

GAbv8rT1ggI_1 0 THESE ARE THE MATERIALS YOU'LL BE USING TO MAKE OUR DRAGON PUPPET
GAbv8rT1ggI_2 0 YOU'LL NEED SOME A LITTLE PIECE OF FEATHER BOA
GAbv8rT1ggI_3 0 WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE TO SIX INCHES OF THIS COLORED FEATHER BOA AND YOU CAN USE ANY COLOR YOU WANT
GAbv8rT1ggI_4 0 YOU'LL NEED SOME CRAFT FEATHERS AND I'VE JUST GOT LITTLE BIT OF THE FEATHERS
GAbv8rT1ggI_5 0 THE RED OR ORANGE FOR A FIRE FOR THE MOUTH AND THEN SOME OTHER COLORS TO DECORATE OUR DRAGON
GAbv8rT1ggI_6 0 YOU'LL NEED SOME FELT OR SOME FUN FOAM TO CUT FOR THE HEAD AND FOR THE TAIL AND THE WINGS
GAbv8rT1ggI_7 0 YOU'LL NEED TWO PIPE CLEANERS AND YOU'LL NEED A NICE THICK CRAFT GLUE
GAbv8rT1ggI_8 0 SOMETHING THAT IS CLEAR DRYING
GAbv8rT1ggI_9 0 YOU'LL ALSO WANT TO USE A PERMANENT MARKER TO DRAW SOME DETAILS ON YOUR DRAGON
GAbv8rT1ggI_10 0 NOW I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO PUT TOGETHER OUR DRAGON PUPPET
GAbv8rT1ggI_11 0 YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR PIPE CLEANERS AND FOLD THEM IN HALF LIKE THIS AND LEAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A LOOP ON THE TOP
GAbv8rT1ggI_12 0 TWIST A LOOP ON THE TOP AND THEN TWIST THE WHOLE PIPE CLEANER DOWN TO THE BOTTOM AND DO THAT WITH BOTH OF OUR PIPE CLEANERS
GAbv8rT1ggI_13 0 NEXT WE'RE GOING TO ATTACH OUR PIPE CLEANERS TO OUR FEATHER BOA HERE
GAbv8rT1ggI_14 0 JUST LOOK FOR A LITTLE BIT OF THE END THAT STICKS OUT IT'S SORT OF THE CORE OF THE FEATHER BOA I PUT A LITTLE BIT OF GLUE ON THAT AND THEN SLIP THAT THROUGH THE LOOP
GAbv8rT1ggI_15 0 NOW YOU CAN TWIST THE PIPE CLEANER ON THERE EVEN A LITTLE TIGHTER IF YOU WANT TO SECURE THAT WELL
GAbv8rT1ggI_16 0 AND NOW DO THE SAME THING ON THIS SIDE
GAbv8rT1ggI_17 0 SORT OF PULL THE FEATHERS BACK OUT OF THE WAY A LITTLE BIT
GAbv8rT1ggI_18 0 AND DAB IT WITH GLUE ALL AROUND
GAbv8rT1ggI_19 0 YOU SHOULD PROBABLY CLEAN OFF THE TIP OF YOUR GLUE AFTER BECAUSE THE FEATHERS REALLY GET STUCK TO IT
GAbv8rT1ggI_20 0 AND THEN IF YOU DON'T MIND GETTING YOUR FINGERS GLUEY YOU CAN KIND OF TWIST THAT PIPE CLEANER A LITTLE MORE
GAbv8rT1ggI_21 0 OK NOW THAT'S THE BODY OF OUR DRAGON
GAbv8rT1ggI_22 0 NEXT WE'LL ATTACH THE TAIL
GAbv8rT1ggI_23 0 I'VE CUT A PIECE OF THIS IS FUN FOAM AND I'VE CUT A TAIL THIS SHAPE
GAbv8rT1ggI_24 0 A LITTLE STRAIGHT ON THE TOP AND A LITTLE CURVED AND TAPERING OFF ON THE BOTTOM AND I'M GOING TO PUT SOME GLUE THERE SOME GOOD THICKNESS OF GLUE THERE AND WE'LL PUT THAT ON THE TAIL END OF OUR DRAGON
GAbv8rT1ggI_25 0 AND YOU CAN KIND OF COVER IT OVER WITH FEATHERS
GAbv8rT1ggI_26 0 YOU CAN EVEN PUT A LITTLE EXTRA GLUE HERE AND PULL THESE FEATHERS DOWN TO KIND OF BLEND INTO THE BODY
GAbv8rT1ggI_27 0 AND NOW WE'LL DO THE HEAD

GAbv8rT1ggI_30 0 AND IT WILL LAY ON THE FEATHER BOA LIKE THIS RIGHT ON TOP OF ONE OF OUR PIPE CLEANER HOLDERS
gza4_JpmOYk_1 0 MILKBONE HERE IS GOING TO HELP ME ILLUSTRATE SOME IMPORTANT CONCEPTS ABOUT HEART DISEASE
gza4_JpmOYk_2 0 MILKBONE IS A VERY ACTIVE CAT AS YOU CAN SEE SHE WANT TO MOVE AROUND SHE'S VERY CURIOUS ABOUT HER ENVIRONMENT
gza4_JpmOYk_3 0 AND ALTHOUGH SHE'S THIN SHE'S VERY HAPPY
gza4_JpmOYk_4 0 THIS IS VERY TYPICAL OF WHAT WE SEE WITH CATS WITH HEART DISEASE
gza4_JpmOYk_5 0 THE SIGNS THAT THEY HAVE ARE VERY SUBTLE AND THEY'RE EASILY MISSED
gza4_JpmOYk_6 0 SO YOUR CAT CAN ACTUALLY HAVE VERY SERIOUS HEART DISEASE AND LOOK COMPLETELY NORMAL TO YOUR EYE
gza4_JpmOYk_7 0 THAT'S WHY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO HAVE PERIODIC VISITS WITH YOUR VETERINARIAN SO YOUR VETERINARIAN CAN LISTEN TO YOUR CAT'S HEART AND PICK UP ANY ABNORMALITIES THAT THEY MAY FIND
gza4_JpmOYk_8 0 CERTAIN ABNORMALITIES IN THE WAY THE HEART BEATS WHICH IS CALLED AN ARRHYTHMIA CAN BE FOUND BY JUST A SIMPLE STETHOSCOPE OVER THE CAT'S HEART LIKE THIS
gza4_JpmOYk_9 0 AND WE CAN ALSO HEAR A GALLOP RHYTHM WHICH IS AN INDICATION THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME ABNORMALITY
gza4_JpmOYk_10 0 HEART MURMURS ARE ALSO OFTEN THE VERY FIRST SIGN OF HEART DISEASE IN CATS
gza4_JpmOYk_11 0 SO HAVE YOUR CAT'S HEART CHECKED REGULARLY SO THAT WE CAN PICK UP ANY PROBLEMS SOON AND START TREATING IT BEFORE THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM SUCH AS SUDDEN DEATH
GHzR2QMXB5g_1 0 ONCE WE'VE SCULPTED OUR TONGUE WE'RE READY TO ATTACH IT
GHzR2QMXB5g_2 0 WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE AS WE LOOK OVER OUR TONGUE THAT THERE AREN'T ANY CRACKS THAT HAPPENED WHEN WE CURVED IT SO ADDING A LITTLE BIT OF WATER AND SMOOTHING IT OUT COULD BE HELPFUL
GHzR2QMXB5g_3 0 I'M GOING TO TAKE OUR FROG AND WE'RE GOING TO START TO FLATTEN OUT THIS PIECE THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO START INSIDE THE MOUTH
GHzR2QMXB5g_4 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS FIND ITS PLACEMENT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR WIRE AND OUR WIRE CUTTERS AND WE'RE GOING TO GET ANOTHER PIECE ABOUT THAT LONG BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO GO IN EVEN FURTHER
GHzR2QMXB5g_5 0 AND WE ARE GOING TO PUT THAT WIRE IN TO THE MOUTH AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S GOING IN TO THE THICK PART OF THE FROG ALMOST ALL THE WAY IN AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO SLID THAT ON THERE
GHzR2QMXB5g_6 0 IF YOU CAN FEEL THE WIRE COMING THROUGH IT'S ALL RIGHT BUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO FROM HERE IS SMOOTH OUT THE TONGUE INSIDE OF THE MOUTH SO THAT IT SORT OF BECOMES ONE UNIT
GHzR2QMXB5g_7 0 THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER HERE IS THAT NOW OUR TONGUE HAS BECOME A POTENTIALLY BREAKABLE PART OF OUR FROG SO WHEN WE'RE MOVING IT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE LIFT THE TONGUE AS WELL
gCGglOKEgvc_1 0 WELL NOW THAT WE'VE SHOWN YOU HOW TO DO A BASIC FELT COVERED SOAP I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU A LITTLE VARIATION
gCGglOKEgvc_2 0 MANY PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF SOAP ON A ROPE
gCGglOKEgvc_3 0 SO WE ARE GOING TO DO FELTED SOAP ON A FELTED ROPE WHICH IS VERY FUN AND IT'S JUST A NEAT WAY TO CHANGE THINGS UP A LITTLE BIT
gCGglOKEgvc_4 0 SO THE FIRST THING WE HAVE TO DO IS MAKE OUR FELTED ROPE
gCGglOKEgvc_5 0 THERE'S A COUPLE STEPS TO THAT BUT IT'S PRETTY EASY TO DO
gCGglOKEgvc_6 0 WE NEED TO START WITH OUR WOOL AGAIN
gCGglOKEgvc_7 0 AND IN THIS CASE WE ARE GOING TO LAY OUT A LINE OF WOOL THAT'S GOING TO BECOME OUR FELTED ROPE
gCGglOKEgvc_8 0 WE ARE GOING TO FELT THE MIDDLE OF IT AND LEAVE THE ENDS FLUFFY AND UNFELTED SO THAT THEY CAN STICK TO OUR SOAP
gCGglOKEgvc_9 0 I'M JUST GOING TO PUT A LITTLE HANDLE ON HERE THAT WILL BE A LITTLE LOOP LIKE COULD BE USED TO HANG YOUR SOAP ON A HOOK IN YOUR SHOWER
gCGglOKEgvc_10 0 AND JUST LIKE WHEN WE DID OUR FELTED SOAP WE NEED TO LAY OUR WOOL IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS IN ORDER TO ALLOW IT TO MAKE A SOLID FABRIC
gCGglOKEgvc_11 0 SO I'M PULLING MY TUFTS OFF USING THE PALM OF MY HAND AND THE ENDS OF MY FINGERS
gCGglOKEgvc_12 0 AND THAT GIVES ME A NICE THIN EVEN SHINGLE OF WOOL SO THAT I CAN ARRANGE THEM ALL OVERLAPPING ON MY PIECE
gCGglOKEgvc_13 0 SO I'M JUST GOING TO DO THIS ONE ALL BLUE
gCGglOKEgvc_14 0 AND THEN I'M GOING TO DO ONE
gCGglOKEgvc_15 0 SO I'M DOING THREE LAYERS
gCGglOKEgvc_16 0 I DID ONE LAYER ONE WAY ANOTHER LAYER ANOTHER WAY AND I'M GOING TO DO A THIRD LAYER SORT OF RANDOMLY ARRANGED TO GIVE ME ENOUGH TO FORM MY ROPE
gCGglOKEgvc_17 0 SO IT'S NOT VERY THICK BUT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS ROLL THIS UP INTO A LITTLE JELLY ROLL OF WOOL
gCGglOKEgvc_18 0 AND THEN I'M GOING TO ADD HOT SOAPY WATER JUST TO THE MIDDLE SECTION TO MAKE MY FELTED ROPE
gCGglOKEgvc_19 0 AND THAT WILL BE MY NEXT STEP
GUPsktT50Zg_1 0 ARMS IN FORWARD EXTENSION WITH WEIGHTS
GUPsktT50Zg_2 0 NOW WE'RE GETTING INTO A CHALLENGING MOVE RIGHT HERE
GUPsktT50Zg_3 0 SO PLEASE IF YOU HAVEN'T TRIED THIS MOVE AND JUST HAPPEN TO FIND THIS CLIP ONLINE I WILL HIGHLY SUGGEST THAT YOU CHECK OUT THE OTHER CLIPS ON ARM EXTENSIONS FORWARD EXTENSIONS ON THE BALL TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU MASTER THE MOVES PROPERLY
GUPsktT50Zg_4 0 I ALSO RECOMMEND THAT YOU USE LIGHTWEIGHTS BECAUSE IF YOU START WITH HEAVY WEIGHTS AND YOU'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE YOU CAN SERIOUSLY HURT YOUR BACK
GUPsktT50Zg_5 0 SO I DON'T WANT YOU TO HURT YOUR BACK AND THINK THAT I WAS GIVING YOU SOMETHING DANGEROUS TO DO SO JUST BE VERY CAUTIOUS LISTEN TO YOUR BODY BECAUSE YOUR BODY KNOWS BEST
GUPsktT50Zg_6 0 NOW WHEN YOU GO IN THE BALL YOU CAN STAY ON YOUR KNEES AND JUST BASICALLY BEND FORWARD ALWAYS THINKING OF A LINE SHINING THROUGH THE CROWN OF THE HEAD
GUPsktT50Zg_7 0 SO THINK OF YOURSELF AS A FLASHLIGHT AND YOU'RE SHOOTING LIGHT WITH THAT
GUPsktT50Zg_8 0 THAT'LL PREVENT THE NECK FROM DOING THIS
GUPsktT50Zg_9 0 SO YOU WANT TO KEEP A NICE ALIGNMENT ON THE NECK
GUPsktT50Zg_10 0 IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE WHOLE ALIGNMENT ISSUE THEN TRY SINGLE ARM INSTEAD OF THE DOUBLE ARMS OR THE TWO ARMS AT THE SAME TIME
GUPsktT50Zg_11 0 NOW YOU CAN STAY HERE AND JUST LIFT
GUPsktT50Zg_12 0 NOW WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOUR SHOULDERS STAY DOWN AS YOU'RE DOING THIS MOVE
GUPsktT50Zg_13 0 YOU CAN ALSO TRY A MORE CHALLENGING POSITION WITH THE LEGS EXTENDED AND JUST BRINGING YOUR ARMS OVERHEAD OR WHAT SEEMS OVERHEAD IN THIS POSITION AND THEN DOWN
GUPsktT50Zg_14 0 THIS IS A REALLY CHALLENGING MOVE THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU TO BE CAREFUL WITH THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT THAT YOU HAVE
GUPsktT50Zg_15 0 YOU CAN ALSO TRY WRIST WEIGHTS THEY COME IN ONE POUND WEIGHT SO YOU CAN WRAP THEM AROUND YOUR HAND AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HOLDING ANYTHING AS YOU'RE LIFTING
GUPsktT50Zg_16 0 OR BASICALLY YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KEEP THE SHOULDERS FROM COMING UP KEEP THAT LINE SHINING ON THE CROWN OF THE HEAD EXHALE INHALE DO A FEEL YOU'LL FEEL THEM ALL ACROSS NOT ONLY THE SHOULDERS BUT ACROSS YOUR BODY
GUPsktT50Zg_17 0 THIS IS A GREAT EXERCISE FOR STRENGTHENING YOUR SHOULDER GIRDLE AND ALSO YOUR BACK
GUPsktT50Zg_18 0 HAPPY POSTURE TO YOU

HIP4gc4gFmk_1 0 I'M MANDY BUTLER ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TUMBLE TRACK WARM UPS TODAY
HIP4gc4gFmk_2 0 NEXT WE'RE GOING TO DO A FORWARD ROLL
HIP4gc4gFmk_3 0 A FORWARD ROLL IS A VERY BASIC TUMBLING SKILL SO A LOT OF PEOPLE OVER LOOK IT
HIP4gc4gFmk_4 0 IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU MASTER THIS SKILL FIRST BEFORE YOU MOVE ON TO MORE ADVANCED SKILLS BECAUSE THEN YOUR TECHNIQUE WON'T BE WHERE IT SHOULD BE AND YOU'RE GOING TO STRUGGLE
HIP4gc4gFmk_5 0 THE PROPER TECHNIQUE FOR A FORWARD ROLL IS TO START WITH YOUR LEGS TOGETHER ARMS UP AND NOTICE THAT I'M IN A STANDING POSITION
HIP4gc4gFmk_6 0 A LOT OF PEOPLE TRY TO START THEIR FORWARD ROLL ALREADY IN A SQUAT WHICH IS A LOT HARDER AND IT DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO PROGRESSION VERY EASILY
HIP4gc4gFmk_7 0 IN ORDER TO MOVE ON TO MORE ADVANCED SKILLS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO START STANDING UP
HIP4gc4gFmk_8 0 I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU FROM A STANDING POSITION ARMS ABOVE MY HEAD
HIP4gc4gFmk_9 0 I'M GOING TO BEND DOWN BEND MY KNEES IN A SQUAT POSITION AND PUT MY HAND FLAT ON THE GROUND IN FRONT OF ME

HIP4gc4gFmk_22 0 THAT TAKES A NICE TIGHT TUMMY AND NICE SQUEEZED BOTTOM

gJfYoICw6wU_8 0 ANYWAY WE HAVE ADDED OUR SHRIMP AND WE ARE GOING TO LET THIS SIMMER FOR FIVE SIX MINUTES SO THE SHRIMP CAN COOK ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND WE WOULD MOVE ON
H1EjVAs2GlM_1 0 HI I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO EXECUTE A LUNGE WITH A TORSO TWIST
H1EjVAs2GlM_2 0 THIS IS GOING TO USE A LOT OF THE MUSCLES IN YOUR QUADRICEPS YOUR HAMSTRINGS YOUR GLUTES AND YOUR OBLIQUES
H1EjVAs2GlM_3 0 THE MUSCLES THAT ARE IN YOUR ABDOMINAL MUSCLES ON THE SIDES
H1EjVAs2GlM_4 0 YOU ARE GOING TO GET YOURSELF SET UP AT FIRST INTO A LUNGE POSITION
H1EjVAs2GlM_5 0 FROM YOUR ANKLE TO YOUR KNEE TO YOUR HIP IS A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE
H1EjVAs2GlM_6 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOUR BACK HIP IS TUCKED UNDER GOING STRAIGHT DOWN TOWARDS THE FLOOR
H1EjVAs2GlM_7 0 WE WANT TO REMAIN ON THE BALL OF THE FOOT AND NOT FLAT HEEL
H1EjVAs2GlM_8 0 SO MAKE SURE THAT THE HIP IS TUCKED UNDER
H1EjVAs2GlM_9 0 WHEN YOU COME DOWN INTO YOUR LUNGE MAKE SURE THAT THE KNEE DOES NOT EXCEED THE TOE LINE
H1EjVAs2GlM_10 0 WE ARE GOING TO START THE POSITION OPTIONAL WITH A WEIGHT
H1EjVAs2GlM_11 0 OR YOU CAN DO A MEDICINE BALL AND NO WEIGHT AT ALL
H1EjVAs2GlM_12 0 MY WEIGHT IS AN EIGHT POUND WEIGHT I'M GOING TO TWIST INTO IT
H1EjVAs2GlM_13 0 I WANT TO ENGAGE THE SIDE OF MY OBLIQUE YOU ARE ALWAYS TWISTING INTO THE KNEE THAT IS IN FRONT
H1EjVAs2GlM_14 0 AS YOU COME UP YOU ARE GOING TO TWIST AND COME BACK DOWN
H1EjVAs2GlM_15 0 SO THINK ABOUT CROSSING OVER THE BODY AND DROPPING BACK DOWN KEEP THE ELBOWS REALLY TIGHT AND STABLE
H1EjVAs2GlM_16 0 NICE STRONG MOTION ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE BODY
H1EjVAs2GlM_17 0 SO THINK ABOUT SOME THINGS TO THINK ABOUT
H1EjVAs2GlM_18 0 HIPS TUCKED UNDER KNEE IN LINE WITH THE TOE YOU'RE TWISTING AWAY FROM THE BODY INTO THAT KNEE AND COMING ACROSS THAT PATH
H1EjVAs2GlM_19 0 DROP AND ROTATE
H1EjVAs2GlM_20 0 YOU WANT TO TRY TO DO THIS BETWEEN EIGHT AND TEN TIMES IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER ADDING MORE REPS AS YOU GO
H1EjVAs2GlM_21 0 IF YOU ARE MORE ADVANCED MAKE SURE YOU THAT EQUALS EQUAL AMOUNTS ON BOTH SIDES
H1EjVAs2GlM_22 0 WEIGHT IS OPTIONAL TO WHATEVER YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH
H1EjVAs2GlM_23 0 AND THAT IS HOW YOU DO A LUNGE WITH A TORSO TWIST
gtEi2g0g5ws_1 0 MATT GRAHAM OKAY
gtEi2g0g5ws_2 0 SO I'VE GOT ALL THESE CLIPPINGS FOR MY NEW STRINGS AND THE BULK OF MY OLD STRINGS TO DEAL WITH
gtEi2g0g5ws_3 0 AND AGAIN AS I'VE SAID THE ONLY REAL SAFETY CONCERN WITH CHANGING GUITAR STRINGS IS THESE SHARP ENDS THAT STRINGS CAN HAVE ON THEM AND YOU DON'T WANT THESE IN A PLASTIC TRASH BAG LOOSE WHERE THEY CAN POKE THROUGH AND SCRATCH SOMEBODY OR EVEN IMPALE SOMEBODY
gtEi2g0g5ws_4 0 SO YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND WRAP THEM CAREFULLY IN A LOOSE COIL LIKE THIS AND YOUR GOAL IS TO KINDA TUCK ALL THOSE SHARP ENDS YOU KNOW TOWARDS THE INSIDE
gtEi2g0g5ws_5 0 AND THEN YOU CAN GET ONE OF THESE PAPER LITTLE BAGS THAT THE STRINGS CAN PACK IN AND EVEN IF YOU WANT TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL PACK IT BACK INSIDE THE VINYL OR CARDBOARD PACKAGING IT CAME IN
gtEi2g0g5ws_6 0 IN THAT WAY YOU CAN THROW IT AWAY WITH A CLEAN CONSCIENCE THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE SOMEBODY TETANUS WITH YOUR NEWLY CHANGED GUITAR STRINGS
GDp_ahHKbns_1 0 WHEN YOU ARE CHANGING YOUR BRAKE FLUID THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS YOU POP THE CAP OFF OF YOUR MASTER CYLINDER
GDp_ahHKbns_2 0 THEN YOU WOULD TAKE A TURKEY BASTER AND YOU WOULD SUCK ALL OF THIS OUT AND PUT NEW FLUID IN AND YOU GO UNDERNEATH THE CAR
GDp_ahHKbns_3 0 SO YOU HAVE SOMEONE INSIDE THE CAR PUSHING DOWN ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AND ONCE THEY HAVE THE BRAKE PEDAL DOWN ALL THE WAY THEY WILL SAY DOWN AND YOU WILL LOOSEN THIS LITER VALVE RIGHT HERE IN THE LOOSEN DIRECTION AND LIQUID WILL COME OUT AND IT IS GOOD TO HAVE A CATCH CAN FOR THAT TOO BECAUSE IT GETS IN ALL THIS PAINT AND IT WILL EAT THAT OR WHEN YOU ARE DONE JUST WIPE IT ALL OFF AND ONCE YOU HAVE HAD IT SO THAT NO MORE LIQUID IS COMING OUT YOU TIGHTEN IT BACK UP AND YOU TELL THEM TO LET IT BACK UP AND THEY PUSH IT DOWN AGAIN AND YOU REPEAT THAT AND YOU OPEN THIS AGAIN AND BLEED IT OUT AND PERIODICALLY MAKE SURE YOU ARE CHECKING THE MASTER CYLINDER WHICH IS WHAT WE HAD OPENED AT FIRST AND WE USED THE TURKEY BASTER FOR FOR TAKING OUT THE FLUID AND YOU KEEP DOING THIS STEP OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON THIS PARTICULAR WHEEL UNTIL YOU GET NEW CLEAR FLUID COMING OUT AND THIS ONE IS DONE AND YOU WILL REMOVE THE NEXT ONE IN THE BACK AND THEN DO THE FRONT ONES
GDp_ahHKbns_4 0 IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHICH ORDER
GDp_ahHKbns_5 0 SOME PEOPLE SAY IT DOES
GDp_ahHKbns_6 0 I DON'T REALLY THINK IT MATTERS
GDp_ahHKbns_7 0 ALMOST ALL THE BLEEDER VALVES ARE AT THE TOP OF THE WHEEL OR THE BACKING PLATE OF THE WHEEL AND THEY ALL LOOK ABOUT THE SAME KIND OF LIKE A LITTLE HEX A SMALL SPOT AND A HOLE RIGHT THERE SO WHEN YOU LOOSEN IT USE A WRENCH SO YOU CAN SEE THE FLUID COMING OUT AND THAT WAY YOU CAN TELL WHEN THE NEW FLUID IS COMING IN ALL THE CLEAR THE NEW FLUID AND YOU CALL SEE WHEN ALL THE OLD STUFF IS FLUSHED OUT OF THE SYSTEM CLEANLY
GDp_ahHKbns_8 0 MOST CARS USE DOT3 BRAKE FLUID SOME CARS WILL USE DOT4 AND FOR THAT AGAIN YOU WILL JUST LOOK AT THE OWNER'S MANUAL AND SEE WHAT THEY RECOMMEND
GDp_ahHKbns_9 0 THERE IS A DOT5 AND A 5.1 AND THOSE ARE FOR RACE CARS SO DON'T USE THOSE FOR YOUR CAR
GDp_ahHKbns_10 0 THE DIFFERENT DOT'S HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ABSORBENCY FOR MOISTURE AND HIGHER BOILING POINTS FOR DOT4 COMPARED TO DOT3
gB76ac8TKWo_1 0 MATT VANSTEENIS HI

gB76ac8TKWo_8 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE SPINNING BACKWARDS YOU'RE ACTUALLY SLIDING DOWN THE RAIL BACKWARDS
gB76ac8TKWo_9 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE SLIDING MAKE SURE YOU'RE STILL LOOKING OVER THAT FRONT SHOULDER AND YOU'RE LOOKING TO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO
gB76ac8TKWo_10 0 SO FIFTY FIFTY AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO TURN MAKE SURE YOU STAY FLAT ON THE BOX CAUSE IF YOU ROCK TOO FAR BACK YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH YOUR HEEL EDGE AND FALL BACKWARDS
gB76ac8TKWo_11 0 AND IF YOU LEAN TOO FAR FORWARD YOU'RE JUST GOING TO SLIDE OUT ON YOUR FACE
gB76ac8TKWo_12 0 SO MAKE SURE YOU'RE FLAT BASED YOU'RE LOOKING LOOKING LOOKING AND THEN WHEN YOU GET TO THE END YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO TURN DROP OFF STRAIGHT AND RIDE AWAY
giK5yGgIq9Q_1 0 THE NEXT CLIP WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU THE OPEN STANCE
giK5yGgIq9Q_2 0 AND WHEN TO USE THIS WHAT KIND OF BALL TO USE THIS ON AND HOW TO RECOVER THERE OFF THAT
giK5yGgIq9Q_3 0 SO YOU'RE OPEN STANCE YOU KNOW THE BALL IS FORWARD ON YOU AND IF YOU HAVE TO GO FORWARD YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE THAT OPEN STANCE TOO MUCH
giK5yGgIq9Q_4 0 THE OPEN STANCE IS A VERY VERY POPULAR MOVE THESE DAYS
giK5yGgIq9Q_5 0 YOU HAVE VENUS SERENA YOU HAVE FEDERER YOU HAVE ALL THE PLAYERS SOMETIMES AT SOME POINT OF THEIR OF THEIR POINT PLAY THAT USE THE OPEN STANCE
giK5yGgIq9Q_6 0 SO WHAT GUSTAVO IS GOING TO DO IS HE'S GOING TO SHOW YOU THAT OPEN STANCE PIVOTING WITH BOTH FEET
giK5yGgIq9Q_7 0 AND THIS IS FOR A BALL THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DEEPER THAT YOU'RE GOING TO JUST TO WANT TO YOU KNOW SAVE YOUR YOUR STEPS AND NOT HAVE TOO MANY
giK5yGgIq9Q_8 0 HERE WE GO

giK5yGgIq9Q_11 0 RIGHT RIGHT FOOT PLANTS OUT LOADS UP
giK5yGgIq9Q_12 0 LOOK AT GUSTAVO LOOKING GOOD WITH THAT
giK5yGgIq9Q_13 0 VERY NICE RIGHT THERE
giK5yGgIq9Q_14 0 THAT OPEN STANCE WE'LL SHOW YOU THAT AGAIN
giK5yGgIq9Q_15 0 SO HE LOADS OUT WITH THAT RIGHT FOOT AND THEN RIGHT IN THERE
giK5yGgIq9Q_17 0 SO HE'S PIVOTING WITH BOTH FEET AS WELL
giK5yGgIq9Q_18 0 AND HE'S STAYS BASICALLY IN THAT SAME SPOT HE'S NOT TRANSFERRING FORWARD HE'S NOT MOVING BACK TOO EARLY
giK5yGgIq9Q_19 0 HE'S FINISHING SHOT HIS SHOT BEFORE HE COMES BACK IN THE MIDDLE AGAIN
GlXwgvjCXGc_1 0 WE CAN USE A NUMBER OF TOOLS TO CUT OUR PLANTS DEMONSTRATES WE CAN USE SCISSORS REGULAR KITCHEN SCISSORS
GlXwgvjCXGc_2 0 THESE ARE USED FOR SEWING YOU CAN GET THEM AT ANY SEWING STORE OR YOU CAN USE A KNIFE OR YOU CAN USE BIG PRUNERS BUT FOR MOST HOUSE PLANTS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE SOMETHING THAT IS TOO BIG AND I SUGGEST YOU USE THE SNIPS OR THE SCISSORS
GlXwgvjCXGc_3 0 SO WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR TOOLS CLEAN BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU MAKE A CUT ON THE PLANT YOU OPEN IT UP FOR DISEASE
GlXwgvjCXGc_4 0 SO YOU CAN DO A FEW THINGS YOU CAN USE JUST REGULAR HOUSEHOLD ALCOHOL AND WE CAN USE A SCRUB BRUSH FROM THE KITCHEN IF YOU HAVE ONE AND JUST CLEAN IT OFF AND GET IT NICE AND CLEANDEMONSTRATES SO WE CAN DO ALL OUR TOOLS
GlXwgvjCXGc_5 0 THESE GOT A LITTLE TOUGHER STUFF ON IT YOU CAN ALSO TAKE JUST SOME WATER AND ADD SOME BLEACH ANOTHER DISINFECTANT LIKE ABOUT TEN %PERCENT AND I CAN SOAK THESE TOOLS FOR ABOUT FIVE OR TEN MINUTES AND THEY WILL BE NICE AND CLEAN FOR WHEN I WANT TO USE THEM AND JUST WHEN I AM DONE JUST DRY IT OFF BECAUSE THE PLANTS THEY DON'T LIKE DISINFECTANT THEY DON'T LIKE BLEACH SO THEY SHOULD BE CLEAN AND SANITARY FOR US TO USE
gINS6aHWGoI_1 0 HOW TO LOSE TWO POUNDS IN A WEEK
gINS6aHWGoI_2 0 THIS IS MY FAVORITE SUBJECT
gINS6aHWGoI_4 0 BECAUSE IT IS SAFE AND IT IS EFFECTIVE
gINS6aHWGoI_5 0 HI MY NAME IS JANI ROBERTS
gINS6aHWGoI_6 0 I AM A GRADUATE OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF NUTRITION AND ALSO A NATIONALLY CERTIFIED PERSONAL TRAINER
gINS6aHWGoI_7 0 TWO POUNDS A WEEK IS AN EXCELLENT GOAL
gINS6aHWGoI_8 0 YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE THE WEIGHT BETTER YET YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP IT OFF
gINS6aHWGoI_9 0 SO JUST CALCULATE EXACTLY HOW MUCH WEIGHT IT IS YOU WOULD LIKE TO LOSE AND THEN HOW MANY WEEKS IT WILL TAKE TO LOSE IT
gINS6aHWGoI_10 0 NOW REMEMBER IF YOU HAVE GOT A LOT OF WEIGHT TO LOSE LET'S SAY 25 FIFTY 75 100 POUNDS YOU ARE PROBABLY GOING TO SEE A LOT MORE THAN TWO POUNDS IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS THEN IT WILL START TO LEVEL OFF
gINS6aHWGoI_11 0 IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS TO LOSE LET'S SAY ONLY TEN POUNDS THEN YOU ARE PROBABLY GOING TO SEE MORE LIKE ONE AND 1/2 TWO MAYBE A LITTLE OVER TWO THEN ONLY ONE AND 1/2 AND IT WILL BE A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO GET IT OFF BUT YOU CAN STILL DO IT
gINS6aHWGoI_12 0 ALL THE RULES ARE THE SAME YOU JUST REALLY HAVE TO KIND OF MODIFY BASED ON EXACTLY HOW MUCH WEIGHT IT IS YOU NEED TO LOSE
gINS6aHWGoI_13 0 SO THE FIRST THING THAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS WE ARE GOING TO PLAN OUR MEALS
gINS6aHWGoI_14 0 THIS IS KEY BECAUSE IF WE DON'T PLAN WE ARE JUST GOING TO IMPROVISE AND WE ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO MAKE A BETTER CHOICE
gINS6aHWGoI_15 0 DID YOU EVER LIKE TRY TO FIND SOMETHING TO EAT AT SEVEN ELEVEN
gINS6aHWGoI_16 0 IT REALLY DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL
gINS6aHWGoI_17 0 SO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS WE ARE GOING TO PLAN
gINS6aHWGoI_18 0 IF YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO WORK
gINS6aHWGoI_19 0 I KNOW IT IS ALWAYS A RUSH BUT YOU CAN DO THIS
gINS6aHWGoI_20 0 THE NIGHT BEFORE MAKE SURE WHEN YOU COOK DINNER YOU MAKE A LITTLE EXTRA SO IF YOU ARE MAKING CHICKEN BREASTS INSTEAD OF MAKING TWO MAKE FOUR
gINS6aHWGoI_21 0 WHEN YOU ARE DONE WITH DINNER MIX UP A LITTLE BIT OF CHICKEN SALAD YOU'VE GOT IT ALL READY TO GO PUT IT IN A TUPPERWARE SHOVE IT IN THE REFRIGERATOR GRAB A FEW CRACKERS IN THE MORNING OUT THE DOOR AND YOU HAVE GOT LUNCH AND THEN YOU ARE NOT BUYING SOMETHING AT A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT OR GRABBING SOMETHING LIKE A CAFETERIA STYLE ENVIRONMENT AT WORK
gINS6aHWGoI_22 0 PLANNING AHEAD MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD
gINS6aHWGoI_23 0 SOMETIMES ON A SUNDAY I WILL ACTUALLY COOK AND PREPARE ENOUGH FOOD FOR ALMOST FOUR TO FIVE DAYS DURING THE WEEK SO THINGS LIKE WHOLE GRAIN RICE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT TAKE A WHILE TO COOK THAT PART OF THE MEAL IS ALREADY PREPARED SO ALL I HAVE TO DO IS QUICK COOK UP SOME FISH OR VEGETABLES AND I'VE GOT A WHOLE MEAL READY TO GO
gINS6aHWGoI_24 0 YOU CAN LOSE TWO POUNDS IN A WEEK AND YOU CAN KEEP IT OFF
gINS6aHWGoI_25 0 I'M JANI ROBERTS
gINS6aHWGoI_26 0 THANKS FOR JOINING
gjgIM_u-bJU_1 0 THE DAISY CHAIN WOULD REFER TO THE ORDER IN WHICH THE PEDALS ARE PLACED ON THE BOARD
gjgIM_u-bJU_2 0 BECAUSE AS YOU GO ALONG YOU'RE GOING TO GO OUT OF YOUR GUITAR INTO THE FIRST PEDAL
gjgIM_u-bJU_3 0 WHEN YOU GET TO THE SECOND PEDAL THE SECOND PEDAL IS GOING TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON EVERYTHING THAT CAME BEFORE IT
gjgIM_u-bJU_4 0 SO WHEN I HIT THIS DISTORTION PEDAL THIS IS JUST A TUNER IT'S JUST A BYPASS SO THIS DOESN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING
gjgIM_u-bJU_5 0 IT'S JUST FOR TUNING BUT THE GUITAR COMES BEFORE IT
gjgIM_u-bJU_6 0 SO WHEN I PUT THIS DISTORTION ON IT AFFECTS THE GUITAR
gjgIM_u-bJU_7 0 NOW IF WE GO FURTHER DOWN THE LINE TO THIS TREMOLO PEDAL
gjgIM_u-bJU_8 0 THIS TREMOLO PEDAL IS EFFECTING THIS DISTORTION AND THE GUITAR
gjgIM_u-bJU_9 0 SO THE ORDER IN WHICH YOU HAVE THE PEDALS INFLUENCES THE SOUND THAT YOU GET BY THE TIME IT GETS OUT TO THE AMP
gjgIM_u-bJU_10 0 SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I TOOK THIS DELAY PEDAL AND PUT IT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAIN I WOULD BE DISTORTING THE SOUND OF THE DELAY RATHER THAN IF I PUT IT AT THE END
gjgIM_u-bJU_11 0 THE DELAY WOULD BE DELAYING THE SOUND OF EVERYTHING THAT CAME BEFORE IT
Hi_OjLrFAdg_1 0 HI I'M CHRIS MURRAY AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU HOW TO PLAY SOCCER
Hi_OjLrFAdg_2 0 SOCCER'S PLAYED IN COUNTRIES ALL AROUND THE WORLD AND IT'S THE BIGGEST SPORT ON EARTH
Hi_OjLrFAdg_3 0 SOCCER'S PLAYED WITH TWO TEAMS ON A BIG FIELD ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY YARDS LONG BY SEVENTY-FIVE YARDS WIDE
Hi_OjLrFAdg_4 0 THERE'S ELEVEN PLAYERS ON EACH TEAM AT THE START OF THE GAME
Hi_OjLrFAdg_5 0 TEN FIELD PLAYERS AND GONE GOALKEEPER
Hi_OjLrFAdg_6 0 THE OBJECT OF SOCCER IS TO POSSES THE BALL AND WORK IT DOWN THE FIELD IN ORDER TO SCORE A GOAL
Hi_OjLrFAdg_7 0 THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT FORMATIONS THAT YOU CAN PLAY IN SOCCER AND THOSE ARE USUALLY COME AS YOU GET OLDER AND WHEN YOU LEARN MORE AND MORE ABOUT THE GAME
Hi_OjLrFAdg_8 0 ONE GREAT THING ABOUT PLAY SOCCER IS THAT YOU DON'T NEED A LOT OF EQUIPMENT TO PLAY
Hi_OjLrFAdg_9 0 ALL YOU REALLY NEED IS A BALL AND A FIELD TO PLAY IN
Hi_OjLrFAdg_10 0 YOU DON'T NEED AN EXPENSIVE PAIR OF CLEATS YOU DON'T NEED A FANCY JERSEY JUST THE BALL AND THE ABILITY TO HAVE A GOOD TIME
Hi_OjLrFAdg_11 0 IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PRACTICE BY YOURSELF ALL YOU NEED IS ABOUT A COUPLE OF YARDS AROUND YOU
Hi_OjLrFAdg_12 0 YOU CAN EVEN PRACTICE IN YOUR BEDROOM IF YOUR MOM LETS YOU
Hi_OjLrFAdg_13 0 ANOTHER GREAT THING ABOUT SOCCER IS THAT IT'S A GREAT WAY FOR YOU TO STAY IN SHAPE FOR YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE
Hi_OjLrFAdg_14 0 A HIGH LEVEL OF ENDURANCE IS NEEDED TO PLAY SOCCER WHICH IS DEFINITELY A GOOD THING FOR PEOPLE THESE DAYS
Hi_OjLrFAdg_15 0 BEING ABLE TO PLAY A NINETY MINUTE SOCCER GAME IS REALLY GOING TO HELP YOU OUT IN THE LONG RUN
Hi_OjLrFAdg_16 0 ALSO THE GREAT THING ABOUT SOCCER IS THAT YOU CAN PLAY FOR IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW OLD YOU ARE TO BE ABLE TO PLAY
Hi_OjLrFAdg_17 0 IF YOU'RE FORTY-FIVE YEARS OLD OR IF YOU'RE TWELVE YEARS OLD YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND SOMEONE TO GO OUT AND PLAY WITH

gw-kKreN0m0_1 0 HELLO I'M SIFU MALLON WITH THE CLEARWATER KUNG FU CENTER
gw-kKreN0m0_2 0 THIS IS MY ASSISTANT MELISSA AND THIS IS KICKBOXING
gw-kKreN0m0_3 0 WE'RE WORKING ON BASIC PAD HOLDING OR FOCUS PAD HOLDING
gw-kKreN0m0_4 0 THE ONE WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING NOW IS FOR OUR UPPER CUT
gw-kKreN0m0_5 0 NOW THE UPPER CUT CAN BE DONE LOW OKAY OR IT CAN BE THROWN HIGH
gw-kKreN0m0_6 0 TO WORK THE UPPER CUT OKAY YOU WANT TO START WITH YOUR HANDS IN FRONT OF THE BODY AND AGAIN YOU'RE GOING TO PUSH THE HANDS DOWNWARD THIS WAY
gw-kKreN0m0_7 0 YOUR HAND INSIDE THE MITT IS ACTUALLY KIND OF PUSHING YOUR KNUCKLES UPWARD AND YOUR FINGERTIPS DOWNWARD OKAY SO THAT YOU HAVE A REAL GOOD CONTROL OF HOW THE HANDS ARE HELD IN YOUR GLOVE
gw-kKreN0m0_8 0 THE ELBOWS ARE IN TIGHT TO THE BODY THIS WAY AND AGAIN AS YOU MEET THE PUNCH YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTACT AND A LITTLE BIT OF TENSION PUSHING IN AND DOWNWARD
gw-kKreN0m0_9 0 TO START A THIS OFF SLOWLY SO MELISSA MAY I HAVE YOU STAND OVER HERE SO WE CAN SEE FROM THIS ANGLE
gw-kKreN0m0_10 0 I'M GOING TO HAVE MELISSA FIRE HER RIGHT HAND THROWING THE UPPER CUT
gw-kKreN0m0_11 0 I'M GOING TO BE USING MY RIGHT HAND AS A GLOVE
gw-kKreN0m0_12 0 SO AGAIN WE MEET EACH OTHER
gw-kKreN0m0_13 0 I GET A SMALL BASE
gw-kKreN0m0_14 0 I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS WITH REALLY WIDE FEET BECAUSE IF I NEED TO MOVE MY BODY AROUND I NEED TO HAVE SOME MOBILITY WITH ME SO I GET KIND OF A NARROW BASE
gw-kKreN0m0_15 0 MY WEIGHT IS IN THE CENTER RIGHT AND MY HANDS ARE UP
gw-kKreN0m0_16 0 NOW SHE'S GOING TO BE FIRING HERE REAR UPPERCUT
gw-kKreN0m0_17 0 SHE'S GOING TO DO IT SLOW FIRST OKAY
gw-kKreN0m0_18 0 NOW WHEN SHE MAKES CONTACT HERE MY HAND IN THE BEGINNING IS JUST GOING TO MEET IT JUST AS THE TARGET OKAY AND NOW AS SHE MAKES CONTACT SHE LIFTS HER HANDS UP AND BRING IT RIGHT BACK AGAIN AGAIN
gw-kKreN0m0_19 0 AND I'M JUST KEEPING IT THERE TO MAKE AS THE TARGET
gw-kKreN0m0_20 0 NOW AS MELISSA INCREASES RIGHT HER ABILITY TO STRIKE HER SPEED AND HER POWER RIGHT WHAT I'LL DO IS AS THE HAND COMES DOWN A LITTLE BIT HARDER NEXT ONE I'LL MEET THE HAND OKAY MEETING THE GLOVE
gw-kKreN0m0_21 0 MEETING THE GLOVE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS STARTS REALLY BUILDING THE STRENGTH IN YOUR HAND THAT YOU'LL NEED LATER ON FOR ACTUALLY GOING INTO SPARRING AND IMPACTING THINGS
gw-kKreN0m0_22 0 THIS IS HOW WE HOLD THE HAND TARGETS FOR UPPER CUT KICKBOXING
gV_n_39YF80_1 0 HI MY NAME IS JUAN CARLOS WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO BECOME A COMPETITIVE BASEBALL PLAYER
gV_n_39YF80_2 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO DEMONSTRATE STRETCHING
gV_n_39YF80_3 0 NOW WE WANT TO DO THIS BEFORE ANY GAME AND BEFORE ANY PRACTICE
gV_n_39YF80_4 0 STRETCHING PREVENTS ANY LIGAMENT PULL OR ANY INJURIES TO YOUR LIGAMENTS AND OTHER JOINTS AND OTHER MUSCLES
gV_n_39YF80_5 0 NOW IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY STRETCHES THEIR ARM LIKE SO YOU WANT TO GET THE PULL RIGHT HERE AND SWITCH WITH THE OTHER ARM
gV_n_39YF80_6 0 YOU CAN ALSO STRETCH THE TRICEPS BY COMING UP HERE
gV_n_39YF80_7 0 AND AFTER YOU ALSO WANT TO DO CIRCLES TO FLEX THE JOINTS ON YOUR BALL AND SOCKET HERE
gV_n_39YF80_8 0 YOUR ROTATOR CUFF
gV_n_39YF80_9 0 LEG STRETCHES SUCH AS STRETCHING OF THE QUAD LIKE SO
gV_n_39YF80_10 0 HAMSTRING STRETCHES BY REACHING DOWN HERE
gV_n_39YF80_11 0 NOW IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU ALSO GET THE AGILITIES IN AS WELL
gV_n_39YF80_12 0 STUFF LIKE LUNGES BACKPEDALS HIGH-KNEES HIGH KICKS AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF OTHER TYPES OF AGILITIES BEFORE A GAME AND BEFORE A PRACTICE SESSION SO YOU CAN MAINTAIN FLEXIBILITY AND YOU MAINTAIN LOOSE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PRACTICE OR OF A GAME
g8WIY93lo4U_1 0 MULCH CAN BE PURCHASED AT MANY DIFFERENT LOCATIONS EVERYWHERE FROM YOUR LARGE RETAIL GARDEN SUPPLY CENTER TO YOUR LOCAL GARDEN CENTER
g8WIY93lo4U_2 0 IT COMES IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT FORMS YOU CAN BUY IT IN BAGS YOU CAN BUY IT IN BULK AND HAVE IT DELIVERED BY TRUCK TO YOUR HOME
g8WIY93lo4U_3 0 IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH MULCH YOU NEED AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING IT FOR
g8WIY93lo4U_4 0 IF YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BE MULCHING A SMALL AREA THEN CERTAINLY PURCHASE BAGS OF MULCH
g8WIY93lo4U_5 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING A REALLY REALLY LARGE AREA IT'S GOING TO BE MORE ECONOMICAL TO PURCHASE IT IN BULK AND HAVE IT DELIVERED TO YOUR HOME
g8WIY93lo4U_6 0 OF COURSE ONCE YOU HAVE IT DELIVERED TO YOUR HOME IF IT'S IN BULK THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A WHEEL BARROW SO THAT YOU CAN CART IT AROUND AND GET IT TO YOUR GARDEN AREAS
g8WIY93lo4U_7 0 MANY TREE CARE COMPANIES ALSO OFFER MULCH WHICH IS ACTUALLY GROUND UP PARTS OF TREES THAT THEY HAVE EITHER REMOVED OR DONE LARGE SCALE TRIMMINGS ON
g8WIY93lo4U_8 0 SO WHENEVER THEY RUN THAT THROUGH THEIR THEIR THEIR PLANT CHIPPER THEY ACTUALLY MAKE A BARK MULCH THAT CAN BE USED IN THE GARDENS
g8WIY93lo4U_9 0 IT'S A GREAT RESOURCE TO USE BECAUSE MANY TIMES THESE COMPANIES ARE ARE CUTTING DOWN TREES THAT WERE ALREADY DEAD
g8WIY93lo4U_10 0 SO NO HARM IS DONE TO ANY PLANTS IN THE MAKING OF THE MULCH

grFUIrG3QbA_16 0 YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR HEAD TURNED TO THE SIDE BUT YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO BE SPOTTING YOUR LANDING FOR THIS STEP
-gvc4debHkM_1 0 WE'RE DISCUSSING SEQUENCE AND AS WITH ANY STUD POKER GAME THAT USES WILD CARDS BUT JUST ENOUGH BRING OUT THE SKILL FACTOR WE NEED TO DISCUSS HOW TO PLAY EARLY IN THE HAND
-gvc4debHkM_2 0 LET'S DO THAT
-gvc4debHkM_3 0 LET'S DEAL OUR DOWN CARDS AND THEN ONE UP CARD TO EVERYBODY AND WE SEE THERE IS NOT A LOT GOING ON HERE
-gvc4debHkM_4 0 AS A MATTER OF FACT NO DEUCES CAME OUT SO NOTHING IS WILD AT THIS TIME AND THE THREE IS FORCED TO DO THE BRING IN BET
-gvc4debHkM_5 0 THEY HAVE AN ACE AND A EIGHT OF DIAMONDS IN THE HOLE AND WHAT'S INTERESTING THAT AT THIS TIME STATISTICALLY THERE IS A DECENT CHANCE THAT THREE'S WILL BE WILD LATER IN THIS HAND
-gvc4debHkM_6 0 SO THEY DEFINITELY WANT TO STAY IN EVEN IF SOMEONE RAISES TO THE MINIMUM BET AFTER THE BRING IN
-gvc4debHkM_7 0 BUT AND THIS IS A BIG BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT WITH WILD CARDS COMING NO ONE NEEDS TO BE RAISING AT THIS TIME
-gvc4debHkM_8 0 UNLESS THEY HAD A SITUATION WHERE THEY HAD AN ACE UP AND EVERYBODY ELSE AT THE TABLE HAD MID CARDS SAY IT WAS AN ACE VERSES THREE SEVENS
-gvc4debHkM_9 0 THEN YOU CAN BET AND SEAL THE POT AS YOUR OPPONENTS FOLD OTHER THAN THAT PLAY CAREFULLY EARLY ON IN THE GAME OF SEQUENCE
GELeQ2CzSD8_1 0 ALRIGHT SO LET'S GO ONTO THE NEXT EXERCISE
GELeQ2CzSD8_2 0 ONE FOOT'S GOING TO GO FORWARD ONE FOOT BACK
GELeQ2CzSD8_3 0 NOW IT CAN TURN TO THE SIDE IT CAN TURN OUT SLIGHTLY BUT PRIMARILY YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE ON A CENTER LINE
GELeQ2CzSD8_4 0 REGARDLESS OF WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING YOU'RE ALWAYS MOVING ON THE CENTER LINE
GELeQ2CzSD8_5 0 IN AIKIDO AIKIJUJITSU BOGWAT JENJI ANY OF THE MARTIAL ARTS THAT ARE OUT THERE YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THAT THEY ALL PRIMARILY AND PRINCIPALLY MOVE ON THE CENTER LINE
GELeQ2CzSD8_6 0 AND THE MORE ON THE CENTER LINE THAT YOU CAN MOVE THE MORE EFFICIENT THE MOVEMENT IS GOING TO BECOME
GELeQ2CzSD8_7 0 AND WE WILL EVENTUALLY SHOW HOW TO ACTUALLY BEND THE STRAIGHT LINE AND HOW TO TURN THE STRAIGHT LINE BUT STILL STAY ON THE CENTER LINE
GELeQ2CzSD8_8 0 SO FOR THIS EXERCISE ONE FOOT'S FORWARD LEFT OR RIGHT AND AGAIN LEFT OR RIGHT FOOT'S FORWARD
GELeQ2CzSD8_9 0 BOTH HANDS ARE GOING TO COME UP AND DOWN
GELeQ2CzSD8_10 0 IT'S THE SAME MOTION THAT WE HAVE BEFORE
GELeQ2CzSD8_11 0 INSTEAD OF OUR HANDS AND PALMS FACING FORWARD THE HANDS ARE COMING UP CREATING A SLIGHT TRIANGULAR POSTURE IN THE FRONT SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A TARGET ALRIGHT
GELeQ2CzSD8_12 0 ONE TWO ONE TWO
GELeQ2CzSD8_13 0 MY FRONT FOOT COMES UP MY BACK FOOT RISES SLIGHTLY AND BUT THE WEIGHT IS STILL ON THE BALLS OF THE FEET
GELeQ2CzSD8_14 0 ONE TWO ONE TWO ONE TWO ONE TWO
GELeQ2CzSD8_15 0 SWITCH OTHER SIDE

gtWi8T8Dg2w_1 0 OKAY IN THIS SEGMENT I'M GOING TO COVER THE C MAJOR BARRE CHORD
gtWi8T8Dg2w_2 0 LIKE ALL PREVIOUS WE'RE GOING TO USE THE SAME SHAPE THE MAJOR BARRE CHORD SHAPE
gtWi8T8Dg2w_3 0 I'M GOING TO START ON THE EIGHTH FRET OF C AND THEN ON YOUR THIRD FINGER AND FOURTH FINGER YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON THE TENTH FRET
gtWi8T8Dg2w_4 0 YOUR SECOND FINGER IS GOING TO BE ON THE NINTH FRET AND THEN OF COURSE YOU'RE BARRING THE REMAINDER OF THE STRINGS SO IT'LL SOUND LIKE THIS YOU COULD ALSO DO IT HERE STARTING ON THE THIRD FRET ON THE A STRING WHICH IS ALSO C AND EITHER USING YOUR THIRD FINGER OR YOUR PINKIE PLAY IT THERE OR USING YOUR PINKIE YOU CAN DO THIS WHICH I FIND MORE COMFORTABLE
gtWi8T8Dg2w_5 0 YOU GET A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SOUNDING BARRE CHORD OF THE SAME NOTE SO YOU CAN EITHER USE IT THERE WITH THE HIGH C OR SIMPLY OMIT THE HIGH C DOWN HERE AND THEN HAVE ANOTHER C MAJOR BARRE CHORD

H0nl3y3f9vo_8 0 YOU WANT TO LET THEM KNOW THIS YOUR JOB
H0nl3y3f9vo_9 0 THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE HERE TO DO
H0nl3y3f9vo_10 0 THEY'RE HERE TO RELAX AND ENJOY THEMSELVES NOT TO BE CLEANING UP MESSES

GsTnIwyNwbk_1 0 HI THIS IS JON AND IN THE CLIP I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT TOOL STORAGE
GsTnIwyNwbk_2 0 NOW ONCE YOU'VE ACCUMULATED A NUMBER OF TOOLS IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO BUILD SOME TYPE OF A STORAGE UNIT TO HOUSE ALL OF YOUR TOOLS SO YOU CAN FIND THEM AND SO THEY DON'T GET DAMAGED
GsTnIwyNwbk_3 0 IN THIS PARTICULAR STORAGE UNIT WE'VE JUST TAKEN SOME PEGBOARD AND SCREWED IT UP AGAINST SOME 2X4'S AND WE'VE USED SOME PEGBOARD HOOKS TO BE ABLE TO HANG SOME OF OUR TOOLS
GsTnIwyNwbk_4 0 ADDITIONALLY WE'VE DESIGNED SOME OTHER STORAGE TYPE DEVICES TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TOOLS
GsTnIwyNwbk_5 0 NOW THERE'S REALLY AN UNLIMITED NUMBER OF POSSIBILITIES THAT YOU CAN USE TO HANG AND DISPLAY YOUR TOOLS BUT YOU ALWAYS WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE BOTTOM LINE IS TO BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR TOOLS SAFE FROM GETTING DAMAGED AND SO THAT YOU CAN FIND THEM EVERY TIME YOU NEED THEM
GsTnIwyNwbk_6 0 HERE WE HAVE ANOTHER STORAGE SYSTEM JUST FOR SOME SIMPLE PALM SANDERS AND WE'VE PUT THOSE ON ROLLERS MADE THAT INTO A DRAWER AND THOSE ARE ALL LOCATED IN A CABINET THAT LOCKS
GsTnIwyNwbk_7 0 NOW IT'S ALWAYS VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP ALL OF YOUR TOOLS LOCKED UP OR OUT OF THE REACH OF ANYBODY WHO DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO USE THEM OR ESPECIALLY CHILDREN
GsTnIwyNwbk_8 0 ADDITIONALLY YOU'LL NOTICE THAT ALL OF MY TOOLS ARE LABELED SO THAT IF FOR SOME REASON I'M USING ALL OF MY DOWELING JIGS AND I FORGET WHERE THEY GO I JUST LOOK AT THE LABEL AND I'M ABLE TO PUT THEM BACK
GsTnIwyNwbk_9 0 YOU REALLY WANT TO CREATE A METHOD THAT WORKS GOOD FOR YOU
GsTnIwyNwbk_10 0 IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK CHANGE IT AND USE SOMETHING THAT WORKS BETTER
GIVRVRNHFkA_1 0 HERE WE'LL TALK ABOUT A SUSPENDED TWO
GIVRVRNHFkA_2 0 NOW LET'S START WITH A D CHORD AGAIN
GIVRVRNHFkA_3 0 HERE'S OUR D MAJOR CHORD
GIVRVRNHFkA_4 0 NOW WE SAID THAT WE HAD AN OPEN D STRING
GIVRVRNHFkA_5 0 THAT'S THE ROOT
GIVRVRNHFkA_6 0 THIS IS THE FIVE AN A NOTE
GIVRVRNHFkA_7 0 THIS IS A D ANOTHER ROOT
GIVRVRNHFkA_8 0 AND HERE WE HAVE THE THIRD AN F SHARP
GIVRVRNHFkA_9 0 NOW THE DEFINITION OF SUSPENDED IS SUCH THAT WE REMOVE THE THIRD AND REPLACE IT WITH THE SECOND NOTE OF THE MAJOR SCALE
GIVRVRNHFkA_10 0 SO WE'RE IN D HERE
GIVRVRNHFkA_11 0 THE D MAJOR SCALE THE SECOND NOTE OF A MAJOR SCALE IS GOING TO BE E SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS TAKE ALL OF THE THIRDS
GIVRVRNHFkA_12 0 OUR THIRDS ARE F SHARPS
GIVRVRNHFkA_13 0 AND TURN THEM INTO E'S
GIVRVRNHFkA_14 0 IN THIS CASE WE'RE GOING TO LIFT UP THE MIDDLE FINGER HERE AND TURN THIS F SHARP INTO AN OPEN E STRING
GIVRVRNHFkA_15 0 AND NOW YOU HAVE A D SUSPENDED TWO
g8SjkolnHfY_1 0 SO AFTER I'VE ESTABLISHED THE BORDER WITH MY PAINTER'S TAPE AROUND THE AREA THAT I AM TO COLLAGE
g8SjkolnHfY_2 0 AGAIN MAKING SURE THAT ALL THE EDGES THAT ARE ACTUALLY FACING THE INSIDE OF THE COLLAGE ARE MOST IMPORTANTLY ADHERED DOWN VERY WELL BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT ANY ADHESIVE OR GLUE OR ANYTHING GETTING SEEPING UNDER THE EDGES
g8SjkolnHfY_3 0 THE NEXT STEP YOU WANT TO DO IS EVEN THOUGHT YOU'VE DRAWN YOUR IMAGE INSIDE TO THE LIKENESS THAT YOU WANT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GO OVER IT WITH YOUR GRAPHITE PENCIL AND YOU JUST MAKE SURE YOU'RE ADDING ALL THE DETAIL ELEMENTS THAT YOU DON'T WANT LOSE AS YOU'RE WORKING ALONG BEFORE YOU SPRAY YOU FIXATIVE SPRAY
g8SjkolnHfY_4 0 AGAIN THE REASON FOR THIS IS SO YOU KEEP ALL YOUR DETAIL SO THAT WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY WORKING WITH YOUR COLLAGE THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO CONTINUALLY BE PAYING ATTENTION TO AND REESTABLISHING AND REDRAWING ALL OF YOUR LINE WORK
g8SjkolnHfY_5 0 SO I TEND TO GO OVER IT AND OVER IT UNTIL I FEEL THAT THE LINES ARE SUFFICIENTLY DARK ENOUGH AND ONCE I'VE GOTTEN TO THAT POINT THEN I TAKE MY WORKABLE FIXATIVE SPRAY AND I SPRAY INSIDE OF THE AREA IN ORDER TO JUST KEEP THE GRAPHITE DOWN TO START MY COLLAGE
g8-ScRqTFDE_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M STEPHEN KOEPFER AT NEW YORK COMBAT SAMBO IN NEW YORK CITY AND TODAY I'M GOING TO BE DEMONSTRATING BEGINNING SAMBO
g8-ScRqTFDE_2 0 IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THE BASIC BACK TRIP
g8-ScRqTFDE_3 0 AGAIN LIKE MOST OF THE THROWS WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SLEEVE AND A COLLAR GRIP
g8-ScRqTFDE_4 0 WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT I STEP IN DEEP AND LOAD MY OPPONENT WITH MY BODY SO HE'S ARCHING BACKWARDS
g8-ScRqTFDE_5 0 IF I DON'T DO THAT AND I STEP IN AND TRY AND TRIP HIM HE CAN THROW ME BACKWARDS
g8-ScRqTFDE_6 0 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT I MOVE IN WITH MY WHOLE BODY WEIGHT AND MOMENTUM
g8-ScRqTFDE_7 0 YOU'LL NOTICE I STEPPED PAST HIS BODY
g8-ScRqTFDE_8 0 THE SECOND STEP BOOM
g8-ScRqTFDE_9 0 THIS LEG IS GOING TO COME DEEP UNDERNEATH
g8-ScRqTFDE_10 0 STILL MAINTAINING THIS BODY CONNECTION CHEST TO CHEST ALL THE TIME
g8-ScRqTFDE_11 0 SO WE'LL DO IT SLOW
g8-ScRqTFDE_12 0 NOW WE'LL DO IT FAST
GBnXmDsh9vw_1 0 YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF DAILY LIFE MOST OF US INCUR SOME TYPE OF MINOR INJURIES
GBnXmDsh9vw_2 0 HI I'M CAPTAIN JOE BRUNI AND WHAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS HOW TO TREAT THE STRAINED BACK
GBnXmDsh9vw_3 0 STRAINED BACKS CAN OCCUR FREQUENTLY AND CAN BE PRETTY DEBILI DEBILITATING AND PAINFUL
GBnXmDsh9vw_4 0 BASICALLY HAVE THE PERSON REST ON SOME TYPE OF SOFT SLEEPING PAD
GBnXmDsh9vw_5 0 APPLY ICE IN TWENTY MINUTE INCREMENTS ON AND OFF FOR APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FOUR TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS
GBnXmDsh9vw_6 0 AFTER FORTY-EIGHT HOURS IF THE PAIN CAME ON GRADUALLY HEAT CAN BE APPLIED IN THE GENERAL AREA OF DISCOMFORT TO INCREASE HEALING AND INCREASE MOBILITY
GBnXmDsh9vw_7 0 STRAINED BACKS OCCUR FREQUENTLY AND CAN BE A PRETTY PAINFUL PROCESS
GBnXmDsh9vw_8 0 WITH THE PROPER TREATMENT OF REST THE APPLICATION OF ICE AND THE APPLICATION OF HEAT IF IT CAME ON GRADUALLY WILL SPEED THE HEALING AND RECOVERY PROCESS
GBnXmDsh9vw_9 0 I'M CAPTAIN JOE BRUNI
GBnXmDsh9vw_10 0 STAY SAFE AND WE'LL SEE YA NEXT TIME
Hiksl7JI3mw_1 0 FOR THE RIGHT HAMSTRING A STRAP CAN BE USED BY JUST LAYING RIGHT DOWN ON A SOFT SURFACE ON YOUR BACK AND BY DOING THIS TIP YOUR PELVIS FORWARD
Hiksl7JI3mw_2 0 NOW TIGHT HAMSTRINGS CREATE DISCOMFORT IN YOUR LOWER BACK THAT'S WHY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO USE SOMETHING LIKE A STRAP NOT JUST TO USE YOUR HANDS YOU DIG A LITTLE BIT DEEPER
Hiksl7JI3mw_3 0 TAKE THAT RIGHT FOOT UP AND TAKE THAT STRAP AROUND THE BALL OF THE FOOT AND THEN EQUALIZE THE LENGTH OF THE STRAP AND AS YOU EQUALIZE THE LENGTH OF THE STRAP SECURE IT AROUND YOUR RIGHT HAND SO YOU HAVE A GOOD FIRM GRIP
Hiksl7JI3mw_4 0 YOU REACH YOUR LEFT HAND UP AND HOLD ONTO THAT STRAP
Hiksl7JI3mw_5 0 NOW RELEASE THE SHOULDERS AND TAKE THE RIGHT TOES RIGHT IN TOWARDS YOU
Hiksl7JI3mw_6 0 NOW THE BREATH TAKES YOU INTO THIS TAKE A DEEP BREATH THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND ON THE EXHALE EDGE THAT RIGHT STRAIGHT LEG IN TOWARDS YOU WITH YOUR BACK STRAIGHT ON THE FLOOR
Hiksl7JI3mw_7 0 INHALE DEEP THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND EXHALE AND ANOTHER DEEP BREATH IN AND EXHALE THEN JUST RELEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE DONE

g7nmnwADi_E_2 0 THE HOLE IS GOING TO BE REALLY OUT OF REACH AND THE BEST WAY TO GET THERE IS GOING TO BE WHAT IS CALLED A DYNAMIC MOVE
g7nmnwADi_E_3 0 SOMETIMES SHORT DYNO JUST FLYING THROUGH THE AIR
g7nmnwADi_E_4 0 SO IN ORDER TO DO THAT WELL AND IN CONTROL YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT STILL SOME BASIC THINGS AND REALLY EXTENDING THEM TO THE LIMITS
g7nmnwADi_E_5 0 BY USING THE OVER HANG TECHNIQUE THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT WITH YOUR ARM STRAIGHT KEEPING YOUR HIPS CLOSE TO THE WALL
g7nmnwADi_E_6 0 YOU ARE GETTING STARTED WITH YOUR WEIGHT MOSTLY ON YOUR FEET
g7nmnwADi_E_7 0 SO FROM HERE TO GET WAY UP THERE I WANT TO USE MY LEGS FOR POWER AND MY ARMS TO DIRECT WHERE I'M GOING AND SOME POWER
g7nmnwADi_E_8 0 SO I'M WIND UP TO GO HERE I DON'T WANT TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME PUMPING MY ARMS YOU SEE PEOPLE DO THAT AVOID THAT I WANT TO THINK ABOUT DRIVING WITH MY LEGS TO GO UP AND PULLING WITH MY ARMS TO STAY IN
g7nmnwADi_E_9 0 SO FROM HERE TO GET UP FLY LIKE THAT SO STARTING OUT WITH YOUR HIPS CLOSE TO THE WALL IN A NORMAL OVER HANG CLIMBING POSITION PUSHING HARD WITH YOUR LEGS AND USING YOUR ARMS TO DIRECT WHERE YOU ARE GOING WILL SEND YOU FLYING IN THE DIRECTION YOU WANT TO GO
g7nmnwADi_E_10 0 CONFIDENCE GRAB THAT HOLD AND HOLD ON TO IT
GJYEPR7zE1w_1 0 NOW I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ON HOW TO SELECT A FRAME THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO AGE
GJYEPR7zE1w_2 0 AS I MENTIONED I'M USING THIS PLAIN BROWN FRAME
GJYEPR7zE1w_3 0 BUT ONE THING YOU WANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS WHEN YOU USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT HAS A SLOPED BACK YOU HAVE TO COME AROUND THE SIDE AND AGE ALL OF THIS
GJYEPR7zE1w_4 0 IF YOU'RE USING A FLATTER FRAME AND A WIDER FRAME THAT DOESN'T HAVE MOLDINGS OR ANYTHING LIKE THIS YOU CAN DO A LITTLE MORE WITH IT AS FAR AS YOUR NAIL HOLES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
GJYEPR7zE1w_5 0 YOU CAN EVEN PUT AN OLD RUSTY HINGE ON IF YOU WANT IF YOU'RE GOING FOR A REAL RUSTIC LOOK
GJYEPR7zE1w_6 0 IN THIS CASE YOU WOULD JUST PAINT THE EDGES ALSO
GJYEPR7zE1w_7 0 ON THIS ONE THAT ACTUALLY HAS AN INSET HERE
GJYEPR7zE1w_8 0 THAT CAN BE PAINTED A DIFFERENT COLOR
GJYEPR7zE1w_9 0 YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING HERE JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT COLOR
GJYEPR7zE1w_10 0 AND YOU WOULDN'T SAND IN THIS AREA BECAUSE THAT'S A LOW SPOT
GJYEPR7zE1w_11 0 NOW ANOTHER OPTION THAT YOU HAVE IS USING A FRAME LIKE THIS THAT ALREADY HAS THIS IS A PEWTER MOLDING
GJYEPR7zE1w_12 0 AND I CHOSE TO LEAVE IT SILVER
GJYEPR7zE1w_13 0 THIS ORIGINALLY WAS JUST AN OAK FRAME
GJYEPR7zE1w_14 0 I CAME IN AND PREPARED THIS FRAME AND THEN I PUT A CRACKLE FINISH ON IT ALL THE WAY AROUND AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL THE DETAILING I DID ON THIS BECAUSE THIS DRESSES UP THE FRAME ENOUGH
GJYEPR7zE1w_15 0 THIS IS TRULY A CHIC AND SHABBY LOOK
GNp4efsnNZ0_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO ABOUT THE PROPER WAY TO REMOVE AND REPLACE AN ELECTRONIC COOLING FAN

GNp4efsnNZ0_4 0 WHAT I HAVE IS A BUCKET I'M GOING TO TAKE SLIDE IT UNDERNEATH THE DRAIN COCK ON THE RADIATOR
GNp4efsnNZ0_5 0 THE RADIATOR IS GOING TO HAVE A DRAIN COCK ON EITHER THE RIGHT OR LEFT LOWER CORNER
GNp4efsnNZ0_6 0 THERE MAY BE A SMALL HOSE CONNECTED TO IT AND WHAT IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE IS A WING NUT NORMALLY MADE OF PLASTIC SCREWED INTO A DRAIN TUBE ON THE RADIATOR
GNp4efsnNZ0_7 0 THIS ONE HAPPENS TO BE LOCATED ON THE RIGHT SIDE RIGHT DOWN HERE
GNp4efsnNZ0_8 0 AS YOU CAN SEE IT DOES LOOK LIKE A WING NUT AND SCREWS INTO THE DRAIN ON THE BOTTOM OF THE RADIATOR
GNp4efsnNZ0_9 0 THIS IS THE DRAIN HOSE THAT IS ATTACHED TO IT
GNp4efsnNZ0_10 0 NOW SOME VEHICLES DO HAVE IT SOME VEHICLES DO NOT
GNp4efsnNZ0_11 0 IF IT DOES YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO TAKE AND POINT THAT HOSE DIRECTLY INTO THE CENTER OF YOUR DRAIN BUCKET
GNp4efsnNZ0_12 0 IT IS A LEFTY LOOSIE RIGHTY TIGHTY KIND OF NUT WE'RE JUST GOING TO UNSCREW IT UNTIL COOLANT BECOMES DRAINING OUT
GNp4efsnNZ0_13 0 NOW IT'S NECESSARY TO DRAIN OUT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT BEING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON THE TOP OF THE VEHICLE
GNp4efsnNZ0_14 0 ALRIGHT RIGHT THERE
GNp4efsnNZ0_15 0 AND THAT IS THE PROPER SERVICE PROCEDURE FOR DRAINING COOLANT OUT OF YOUR RADIATOR

g-fwxsQc4bM_7 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE LEANING A LITTLE BIT FORWARD SO THAT THE MOST OF YOUR WEIGHT IS ON THE BALLS OF YOUR FEET
g-fwxsQc4bM_8 0 YOU SHOULD HAVE THE FEELING OF BUOYANCY
g-fwxsQc4bM_9 0 THAT YOU'RE ALMOST FLOATING
g-fwxsQc4bM_10 0 SO DO NOT LEAN BACKWARDS
g-fwxsQc4bM_12 0 YOUR SHOULDERS SHOULD BE BACK AND RELAXED AND LOOSE
g-fwxsQc4bM_13 0 AND YOUR HANDS SHOULD BE BY YOUR SIDE
g-fwxsQc4bM_14 0 WHEN YOU BREATHE YOUR ABDOMEN SHOULD BE NICE AND TALL SO THAT YOU CAN FULLY EXPAND THAT BREATH
g-fwxsQc4bM_15 0 YOUR CHIN SHOULD BE ABOUT PARALLEL TO THE FLOOR
g-fwxsQc4bM_16 0 AND IF YOU WANT TO START WITH YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HIPS TO CHECK YOUR BREATHING THAT'S FINE
g-fwxsQc4bM_17 0 BUT AGAIN LET YOUR HANDS RELAX BY YOUR SIDE

gnwFScbtWPU_1 0 HI I AM WILLIAM JOSEPH HILL WITH EXPERT VILLAGE COM
gnwFScbtWPU_2 0 I AM HERE TO TALK ABOUT OKINAWAN KENPO KARATE I AM A SECOND DEGREE BLACK BELT FROM HONOLULU HI THAT IS WHERE I GOT ALL MY TRAINING
gnwFScbtWPU_3 0 I AM GOING TO GO OVER THE HISTORY OF KARATE WHICH APPLIES TO NOT JUST OKINAWAN KENPO BUT ALL OKINAWAN STYLES AND EVEN JAPANESE STYLES
gnwFScbtWPU_4 0 I'LL SOME DEMONSTRATIONS OF SOME BASIC TECHNIQUES AND AN OVERVIEW OF KATAS SPARRING ALL THE DIFFERENT FACETS OF THE MARTIAL ART AND I WILL ALSO SO A BIT OF WEAPONS OR KOBUDO
gnwFScbtWPU_5 0 SO NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF KARATE NOW THERE ARE ALOT OF DIFFERENT THEORIES AS TO WHERE TO MARTIAL ARTS CAME FROM
gnwFScbtWPU_6 0 ALL OF THEM ARE PROBABLY EQUALLY VALID BUT THE ONE THEORY IS THAT MARTIAL ARTS ACTUALLY ORIGINATED IN ANCIENT GREECE
gnwFScbtWPU_7 0 THERE IS THIS FORM IF GREEK WRESTLING CALLED PANKRATION AND IT INCLUDED PUNCHING KICKING GRAPPLING IT LOOKED LIKE TODAY'S UFC FIGHTS OR ULTIMATE FIGHTING
gnwFScbtWPU_8 0 FROM THERE THE ANCIENT GREEK SAILORS TRAVELED AROUND THE WORLD THEY BECAME IN CONTACT WITH THE ASIANS CHINESE AND THE INDONESIANS AND THE THAI'S AND THAT'S WHERE THE CHINESE PICKED IT UP
gnwFScbtWPU_9 0 FROM THERE THE CHINESE REALLY EVOLVED MARITAL ARTS INTO THIS ADVANCED SYSTEM THAT PEOPLE CALLED KUNG FU
gnwFScbtWPU_10 0 BUT THERE IS ACTUALLY LITERALLY HUNDREDS MAYBE EVEN THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF KUNG FU OR WU SHU AS THEY CALL IT IN CHINA MARTIAL ARTS
gnwFScbtWPU_11 0 THE CHINESE SAILORS THEY STARTED TO DO TRADE WITH THE OKINAWA THE SMALL ISLAND THAT IS SOUTH OF JAPAN AND THAT IS WHERE THEY CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE OKINAWANS
gnwFScbtWPU_12 0 NOW THERE WAS ONE CHINESE SAILOR HE WAS A MILITARY LEADER THAT ACTUALLY TRAVELED TO OKINAWA HIS NAME WAS KO SOKU AND HE CAME AND DID ALOT OF TRADE WITH THE OKINAWANS AND SHOWED THEM ALOT OF TECHINQUES OR WHAT THEY CALLED TRU ANFA OR LONG FIST BOXING OR AS LIKE KENPO LAW OF THE FIST WAS THE LITERAL TRANSLATION FOR THAT
gnwFScbtWPU_13 0 THE OKINAWANS SAW THESE REAL ADVANCED CHINESE TECHNIQUES AND THE THING IS WITH CHINESE TECHNIQUES IF YOU HAVE EVER SEEN KUNG FU ITS VERY LONG STANCES VERY EXTENDED FLOWERY CIRCULAR MOTIONS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
gnwFScbtWPU_14 0 THE OKINAWANS THEY ARE KIND OF LIKE VERY SIMPLE MINDED THEY LIVED IN KIND OF BEACH TERRAIN THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TRY THAT KIND OF STUFF BECAUSE IT'S DANGEROUS FOR YOUR FOOTWORK YOU MIGHT SLIP
gnwFScbtWPU_15 0 SO THEY ADAPTED IT TO THEIR OWN LOCALIZED FIGHTING STYLE WHICH WAS JUST WRESTLING AND THROWING EACHOTHER AROUND AND STUFF
gUp_Y1FH_OY_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS GAIL STOLOVE WITH HOLY MACRO IN FORT LAUDERDALE FLORIDA
gUp_Y1FH_OY_2 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A DAY IN THE LIFE OF THE MACROBIOTIC LIFESTYLE
gUp_Y1FH_OY_3 0 I JUST WANT TO MENTION AT THIS POINT THAT I'M A CANCER SURVIVOR I'M A TWELVE YEAR CANCER SURVIVOR AND WHEN I TELL PEOPLE THAT THEY LOOK AT ME IN DISBELIEVE
gUp_Y1FH_OY_4 0 THEY DON'T BELIEVE THE WAY THAT I LOOK AND THE AMOUNT OF THINGS THAT I DO IN THE COURSE OF A DAY AND THE ENERGY LEVEL THAT I HAVE
gUp_Y1FH_OY_5 0 THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT I WAS EVER SICK BUT TWELVE YEARS AGO I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER AND I WAS GIVEN SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS TO LIVE AND THAT WAS WHAT PROMPTED ME TO GET INTO MACROBIOTICS
gUp_Y1FH_OY_6 0 BUT IT'S NOT WHAT MOTIVATES MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT I WORK WITH
gUp_Y1FH_OY_7 0 MANY OF THEM ARE DOING IT SIMPLY TO PREVENT EVER HAVING SUCH A HEALTH CRISIS IN THEIR LIFE
gUp_Y1FH_OY_8 0 UNFORTUNATELY I HAD TO HAVE THE HEALTH CRISIS BUT I DO FEEL IT'S A BIG PART OF THE REASON THAT I'M HERE TODAY THAT I'M ALIVE AND WELL AND HAVE MORE ENERGY THAN MOST PEOPLE COULD EVER DREAM OF HAVING
hC5uEaj5yLM_1 0 SO JUST LIKE WE'VE DONE IN OTHER ROOMS
hC5uEaj5yLM_2 0 WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN PACK IN YOUR KITCHEN TWO WEEKS OUT YOU WANT TO LOOK AT YOUR DECORATIONS
hC5uEaj5yLM_3 0 SO THINGS THAT I TALKED ABOUT NOT WANTING TO PACK TO PACK PICTURES AND THAT KIND OF THING
hC5uEaj5yLM_4 0 BUT THINGS IN MY KITCHEN THAT I HAVE UP AS DECORATION OR THINGS LIKE THIS WOODEN SPOON I CAN GO AHEAD AND PACK THAT
hC5uEaj5yLM_5 0 OR THIS BASKET WHICH ISN'T NECESSARILY DECORATION
hC5uEaj5yLM_6 0 BUT IT'S KIND OF AN ACCESSORY IN A WAY
hC5uEaj5yLM_7 0 AND I CAN GO AHEAD AND PACK THAT AND PUT MY POTATOES AND WHAT NOT IN ANOTHER PLACE
hC5uEaj5yLM_8 0 I CAN ALSO GO AHEAD AND PACK ALL OF MY REFRIGERATOR ART
hC5uEaj5yLM_9 0 WHICH WHAT I LIKE TO DO WITH THAT IS IF I'M GOING IF I DON'T WANT IT ANYMORE OBVIOUSLY TO RECYCLE IT OR THROW IT AWAY
hC5uEaj5yLM_10 0 BUT WITH THINGS LIKE PHOTOGRAPHS AND PICTURES THAT I DO WANT TO KEEP THEN I LIKE TO KEEP THOSE IN A FILE FOLDER THAT I HAVE THAT I SHOWED YOU AT THE BEGINNING THAT WAS WHERE I KEPT PERSONAL THINGS LIKE LETTERS AND PICTURES AND THAT KIND OF THING

hC5uEaj5yLM_13 0 AND ANY OTHER DECORATIONS THAT YOU HAVE
hC5uEaj5yLM_14 0 I HAVE THIS CURTAIN AND ALTHOUGH I DID PACK MY SHOWER CURTAIN EARLY THIS SERVES A UTILITARIAN PURPOSE AT NIGHT BEING ABLE TO CLOSE IT SO I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO LEAVE THIS UP

ghML1LTRlHg_1 0 WE TALKED ABOUT HOWARD CLOCKS BEING VERY COLLECTIBLE
ghML1LTRlHg_2 0 THEY'VE CERTAINLY MADE MANY MORE STYLES AND AND CASES THAN THAT NUMBER SEVENTY OR THE NUMBER FIVE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT
ghML1LTRlHg_3 0 FORTUNATELY WE HAVE REPRODUCTIONS OF VARIOUS HOWARD CATALOG CATALOGS FROM THOSE PERIODS
ghML1LTRlHg_4 0 WHERE YOU CAN SEE THEY'VE MADE SOME MASTER CLOCKS
ghML1LTRlHg_5 0 THEY MADE WATCHMAN'S CLOCKS WHICH MADE SURE THAT THE NIGHT WATCHMAN WAS MAKING HIS ROUNDS AND NOT ASLEEP WHEN HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE GUARDING THE FACTORY
ghML1LTRlHg_6 0 AND THEY MADE BIG FLOOR STANDING CLOCKS AS WELL
ghML1LTRlHg_7 0 THEY ALSO MADE ASTRONOMICAL CLOCKS TO BE USED IN OBSERVATORIES FOR TIMING CELESTIAL EVENTS
ghML1LTRlHg_8 0 THEY WERE REALLY THE THE ROLLS ROYCE PERHAPS IN THAT SENSE OF AMERICAN CLOCK MAKING
ghML1LTRlHg_9 0 BECAUSE THEY COULD ON SPECIAL ORDER ONLY MAKE ALL TYPES OF EXOTIC HIGH PRECISION TIME KEEPERS FOR VARIOUS APPLICATIONS THAT WERE NEEDED
ghML1LTRlHg_10 0 YOU CAN ALSO IN TRAN DUY LY BOOKS YOU CAN FIND THESE LISTINGS
ghML1LTRlHg_11 0 BUT THE RECORDS SEEM TO BE FALLING FOR HOWARD VALUES MORE AND MORE

GD2fUkfuMWo_1 0 THIS IS GOING TO BE YOUR BASIC POOL LIGHT IN EVERY POOL
GD2fUkfuMWo_2 0 EVEN SOME SPAS WILL LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME WAY
GD2fUkfuMWo_3 0 THIS TYPE OF POOL LIGHT HAS A FLOOD LIGHT IN IT THAT'S GOING TO RANGE ANYWHERE FROM THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED WATT LIGHT BULB
GD2fUkfuMWo_4 0 THESE ARE ACTUALLY NOW BEING PULLED OUT OF POOLS AND BEING REPLACED WITH LED
GD2fUkfuMWo_5 0 ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE A CHANGE IN COLOR ADDS MORE ELABORATE FEELING OR A ENVIRONMENT FOR THE BACKYARD
GD2fUkfuMWo_6 0 I HAVE A POSTER OVER HERE THAT'S GOING TO EXEMPLIFY ONE OF THE COLORS THAT THESE TYPES OF LIGHTS WILL DO
GD2fUkfuMWo_7 0 NOT ONLY WILL THEY DO PINK RED VIOLET BUT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING BLUES GREENS FADES THERE'S EVEN A PARTY MODE TO GO FROM EVERY COLOR TO FLASHING SO IT'S AN ONGOING ROTATING COLOR WHEEL
GD2fUkfuMWo_8 0 THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN EVERY POOL
GD2fUkfuMWo_9 0 IT COMES ALL COMPLETE WITH CORD EVERYTHING
GD2fUkfuMWo_10 0 THE CORD MINIMUM IS GOING TO BE FIFTY FEET TO ONE HUNDRED FEET THEY HOOK UP TO A GFI THAT WOULD TRIP IF THIS WERE TO LEAK OR THE CORD WOULD BREAK OR WATER GOT IN THE BULB ANYTHING LIKE THAT TO SAVE YOURSELVES FROM NOT GETTING ELECTROCUTED
GD2fUkfuMWo_11 0 YOU CAN DO WHAT'S GETTING PRETTY POPULAR NOW ARE WHAT'S CALLED LIGHT SHOWS
GD2fUkfuMWo_12 0 THESE ARE SMALL LED LIGHTS A VERY SMALL VERSION OF WHAT YOU CAN DO TO THE POOL
GD2fUkfuMWo_13 0 THERE'S LARGER ONES HERE THIS IS A STARSHIP
GD2fUkfuMWo_14 0 THIS IS GOING TO BE ONE FOR YOUR AVERAGE BACKYARD POOL
GD2fUkfuMWo_15 0 THESE ARE KIND OF THE PATTERNS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE DOING AGAIN THEY WORK OFF LED
GD2fUkfuMWo_16 0 THESE WORK OFF DOUBLE A BATTERIES SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE CHANGING THEM OFTEN
GD2fUkfuMWo_17 0 THIS IS ALSO WHAT'S GOING TO LIGHT UP THE POOL THIS IS ONE OF THE EXAMPLES
GD2fUkfuMWo_18 0 THIS ONE TICKS IS FIVE DIFFERENT EXAMPLES THAT ONE DOES TEN
GD2fUkfuMWo_19 0 THESE ARE A CHEAPER LESS EXPENSIVE WAY TO LIGHT UP THE POOL
GVox5SW_Jj8_1 0 NOW LET'S LOOK AT OUR SETTINGS FOR OUR FIBERS FILTER THAT WE'VE APPLIED TO THIS
GVox5SW_Jj8_2 0 AS WE CAN SEE HERE WE HAVE OUR SETTINGS SET UP
GVox5SW_Jj8_3 0 AND WE HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS HERE
GVox5SW_Jj8_4 0 WE HAVE VARIANCE AND STRENGTH
GVox5SW_Jj8_5 0 NOW YOU CAN HIT RANDOMIZEAND IT WILL JUST YOU KNOW RUN THROUGH HERE AND RANDOMIZE THE PATTERN JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR YOU
GVox5SW_Jj8_6 0 SO YOU CAN ALWAYS CHOOSE WHAT IT IS THAT YOU LIKE BETTER
GVox5SW_Jj8_7 0 I THINK THERE WAS ACTUALLY ONE BACK THERE I LIKED A LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT AS WE KEEP GOING LET'S CHOOSE THIS ONE
GVox5SW_Jj8_8 0 THIS ONE WILL BE FINE FOR ME
GVox5SW_Jj8_9 0 NOW WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO SET MY VARIANCE AT SIXTEEN
GVox5SW_Jj8_10 0 MY STRENGTH LET'S SET IT UP JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE
GVox5SW_Jj8_11 0 SET IT UP NOT THAT HIGH
GVox5SW_Jj8_12 0 LET'S GO AROUND-LET'S GO AROUND FOURTEEN
GVox5SW_Jj8_13 0 THERE WE GO
GVox5SW_Jj8_14 0 BECAUSE THE HIGHER YOU GO THE MORE LINES IT'S REALLY GOING TO PUT IN THERE
GVox5SW_Jj8_15 0 AND IT'S LIKE IT DEPENDS ON HOW GRAINY YOU WANT YOUR WOOD DEPENDING ON WHAT KIND OF WOOD YOU'RE EMULATING
GVox5SW_Jj8_16 0 LIKE IF YOU WANT TO GET REAL HIGH FOR SOME REALLY CLOSE CUT HARD WOOD THEN YOU CAN DO THAT
GVox5SW_Jj8_17 0 LET'S-I'M GOING TO BRING IT DOWN TO ABOUT HERE
GVox5SW_Jj8_18 0 THIS LOOKS GOOD FOR ME
GVox5SW_Jj8_19 0 SIXTEEN AND SIXTEEN
GVox5SW_Jj8_20 0 WE HIT OK AND THERE WE GO
GVox5SW_Jj8_21 0 AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE A LOT OF TEXTURE GOING ON HERE IN OUR FIBERS FILTER THAT WE JUST APPLIED
GVox5SW_Jj8_22 0 SO LET'S GO UP HERE AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
GVox5SW_Jj8_23 0 WE'RE GOING TO PAUSE RIGHT HERE FOR RIGHT NOW AND WE'LL PICK IT UP IN THE NEXT PART
GNJ7z3m8V_k_1 0 THE FIRST THING WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SOME SHAPES THAT ARE GOING TO GO AROUND THE LAMPSHADE
GNJ7z3m8V_k_2 0 THIS PART OF THE PROJECT CAN EITHER BE DONE BY FREEHAND DRAWING OR YOU CAN JUST TAKE SOME SHAPES THAT ARE PRINTED OUT FROM A COMPUTER OR YOU CAN TAKE SOME HARD IMAGES AND YOU CAN JUST TRACE AROUND THEM LIKE PIECES OF A PUZZLE CAN GIVE YOU A NICE SHAPE SOMETIMES
GNJ7z3m8V_k_3 0 BUT WE GO AHEAD AND MAKE DIFFERENT IMAGES
GNJ7z3m8V_k_4 0 NOW IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOT MAKE THE IMAGES TOO BIG WE DON'T WANT THEM TO TAKE UP ANY LARGE AREAS OF THE LAMPSHADE
GNJ7z3m8V_k_5 0 ONE OF THE NICE FEATURES ABOUT DOING THE LAMPSHADE IS THAT IT'S MADE UP OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT SMALL IMAGES THAT GO ALL AROUND THE LAMPSHADE
GNJ7z3m8V_k_6 0 SO WE DON'T WANT ANY ONE IMAGE TAKING UP TOO MUCH SPACE WHEN THEY BECOME TRACED ONTO THE PLASTIC SHEET WHICH IS GOING TO BE THE LAMPSHADE ITSELF
GNJ7z3m8V_k_7 0 NOW IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU PUT THE IMAGES ON THE PAPER BECAUSE THE PAPER CAN BE MOVED AROUND AND WHEN IT'S TRACED ONTO THE SHEET OF PLASTIC IT COULD JUST BE MOVED AROUND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EXACTLY AS IT LOOKS ON THE PAGE
GNJ7z3m8V_k_8 0 SO WE MAKE DIFFERENT SHAPES HERE I'M USING A THEME OF LIKE KIND OF A BEACH WATER THEME I HAVE SOME FISH STARFISH AND DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU USUALLY FIND AROUND THE OCEAN AND AROUND THE BEACH
GNJ7z3m8V_k_9 0 ALSO BE SURE THAT YOU DRAW SOME IMAGES THAT CAN BE COLORED NICELY EASILY COLORED AND YOU ALSO CAN USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT COLORS WHEN YOU DECORATE THEM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE ALSO THE PROJECT STAND OUT THAT THE IMAGES ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME NICE LIVELY BRIGHT COLORS
GNJ7z3m8V_k_10 0 FOR THE SHEET OF PLASTIC THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING THESE IMAGES ON WE'LL PROBABLY NEED ABOUT TEN OR TWELVE IMAGES
GNJ7z3m8V_k_11 0 NOW YOU CAN USE THE SAME IMAGE OVER AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S BEING TRACED
GNJ7z3m8V_k_12 0 BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE USING A SHEET OF PLASTIC ABOUT TWENTY FOUR INCHES IN LENGTH ROLLED AROUND SO FOR THAT YOU'LL NEED ABOUT TEN DIFFERENT IMAGES TEN TO TWELVE IMAGES TO GO AROUND
GNJ7z3m8V_k_13 0 SO I'VE SHOWN YOU NOW HOW TO MAKE SOME IMAGES ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND GET THEM READY TO BE TRANSFERRED ONTO THE SHEET OF PLASTIC
ghWwS5ev6xk_1 0 ONE WAY TO GET READY FOR DOING CLEAN SPINS ON A WAVE OR HOLD IS TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT YOU DO YOUR FORWARD SWEEP STROKES IN STANDING WATER OR EVEN YOUR REVERSED SWEEP STROKES IN FLAT WATER
ghWwS5ev6xk_2 0 WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH SWEEP STROKES IS WIND BACK UP AT THE END
ghWwS5ev6xk_3 0 AND WHAT I AM LOOKING TO REALLY TRY AND DO IS KEEP MY TORSO POWER IN FRONT OF MY KAYAK
ghWwS5ev6xk_4 0 SO WHEN I WIND UP FOR THE BEGINNING OF MY SWEEP I HAVE A LOT OF POWER PULLING THE BOAT INTO THE SIDE AND AS I UNWIND MY TORSO COMES BACK TO NEUTRAL AND I LOSE THAT POWER
ghWwS5ev6xk_5 0 IF I GO ANY FURTHER BACK I AM ACTUALLY COUNTER ACTING THAT SPIN AND THAT'S BAD
ghWwS5ev6xk_6 0 SO IF I WANT TO GO FROM SIDEWAYS I CAN ACTUALLY WIND UP BACK AGAIN AT THE TAIL END OF MY SWEEP AND THIS WILL KEEP THE BOAT FROM PULLING AROUND
ghWwS5ev6xk_7 0 SO TAKE A LOOK I'LL WIND UP SWEEP TO THE MIDDLE AND REWIND UP AND THAT REALLY ALLOWS THE BOAT TO KEEP COMING AROUND KEEP COMING AROUND
ghWwS5ev6xk_8 0 THIS IS A STROKE THAT THE PRO'S WILL USE WHEN YOU SEE THEM DOING CLEAN SPIN ON THE WAVES OR CLEAN SPINS IN THE HOLE
ghWwS5ev6xk_9 0 THE MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH IT THE MORE SNAP YOU WILL GET
ghWwS5ev6xk_10 0 YOU REALLY NOTICE THAT ENERGY BUILDING UP AT THE END OF YOUR SWEEP STROKE
ghWwS5ev6xk_11 0 YOU CAN SEE HOW THE BOAT ACCELERATES RIGHT AT THE VERY END
G_homXRgREU_1 0 THE NEXT STYLE THAT I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO AND YOU USE YOUR DISCRETION AGAIN IS A KEYHOLE NECKLINE
G_homXRgREU_2 0 AND THIS IS ONE OF THE NECKLINES WHERE RIGHT HERE YOU HAVE A CLASP OR A BUTTON OR A SNAP OR A HOOK
G_homXRgREU_3 0 OR WHATEVER YOU DECIDE THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE RIGHT THERE AND IT CLOSES AT THAT POINT
G_homXRgREU_4 0 THIS PART IS OPEN
G_homXRgREU_5 0 SO YOU WOULD SEE THE SKIN YOUR CHEST
G_homXRgREU_6 0 YOUR SKIN THERE OR IF YOU GOT ANOTHER SHIRT ON
G_homXRgREU_8 0 BUT THAT PART IS OPEN RIGHT THERE
G_homXRgREU_9 0 I WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS ONE
G_homXRgREU_10 0 THIS ONE HAS A ROUND NECKLINE PRETTY MUCH
G_homXRgREU_11 0 JUST LIKE THE FIRST ONE THAT I SHOWED YOU
G_homXRgREU_12 0 THEN WHEN YOU COME TO THE MIDDLE THERE'S YOUR KEYHOLE AND THEN A LITTLE CLASP
G_homXRgREU_13 0 AND YOUR BUTTON
G_homXRgREU_14 0 AGAIN THIS IS UPSIDE DOWN SO PLEASE JUST BARE WITH ME
G_homXRgREU_15 0 THERE YOU GO
G_homXRgREU_16 0 AND AS A VARIATION MAYBE YOU HAVE A BIG KEYHOLE
G_homXRgREU_17 0 MAYBE YOU HAVE A REALLY LONG KEYHOLE
G_homXRgREU_18 0 WHO KNOWS MAYBE FLIP IT AND DO THE KEYHOLE IN THE BACK
G_homXRgREU_19 0 POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS
gzgXX7tm9P4_1 0 NEXT STEP IS A FOUNDATION PRIMER NOW I THINK THIS IS ESSENTIAL FOR APPLYING MAKEUP
gzgXX7tm9P4_2 0 WHAT FOUNDATION PRIMER DOES USUALLY FILLS UP ANY LINES ANY PORES ANY DISCOLORATIONS THAT REFLEXES LIGHT
gzgXX7tm9P4_3 0 OBVIOUSLY MY GIRLFRIEND KATRINA GOT GORGEOUS SKIN AND DOES NOT REALLY NEED IT BUT ON THE DAY OF HER WEDDING IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT JUST TO KEEP THE MAKEUP WEARING ALL DAY
gzgXX7tm9P4_4 0 YOU JUST WANT TO PUT A LITTLE ON THE BACK OF YOUR HAND AND JUST BRUSH IT ON WITH THE BRUSH
gzgXX7tm9P4_5 0 NOW THE ONE THAT I HAVE CHOSEN IS FROM ARMANI WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT HAS A LITTLE BIT OF 24 KARAT GOLD IN IT WHICH IS A FIRMING AGENT BUT IT IS A LIGHT WEIGHT GEL
gzgXX7tm9P4_6 0 IT IS GREAT FOR ALL SKIN TYPES AND WHEN IT DRIES IT IS GOING TO LEAVE A NICE RADIANT GLOW TO THE SKIN AND WE ALL WANT TO LOOK RADIANT ON THE DAY OF OUR WEDDING
gzgXX7tm9P4_7 0 SO JUST LET THAT DRY ALL THE WAY AROUND BUT NOT UNDERNEATH THE EYES AND YOU CAN ALREADY SEE HOW THAT HAS REALLY BRIGHTEN AND ILLUMINATED HER SKIN
gzgXX7tm9P4_8 0 SO THERE IS YOUR PRIMER DEFINITELY A ESSENTIAL
Gz0MvCmyz7M_1 0 LET'S ADD SOME ARM MOVEMENT TO YOUR ROCKING REVERSE UNDULATION
Gz0MvCmyz7M_2 0 HI I'M JOHANNA AND THIS IS KAREN AND WE'RE HERE FROM HIP EXPRESSIONS BELLY DANCE STUDIO IN ST PETERSBURG FLORIDA
Gz0MvCmyz7M_3 0 SO LET'S START WITH OUR ROCKING REVERSE UNDULATION
Gz0MvCmyz7M_4 0 LET'S PUT OUR WEIGHT ON OUR LEFT FOOT RIGHT FOOT FORWARD
Gz0MvCmyz7M_5 0 AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO HERE IS WITH THE HIP THAT'S TOWARD OUR AUDIENCE WE'RE GOING TO PRESS OUR ARM OUT STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE AUDIENCE
Gz0MvCmyz7M_6 0 KEEP YOUR SHOULDER BLADE DOWN AND THE BACK ARM IS GOING TO GO STRAIGHT UP NICE PRETTY FINGERS DON'T LET THE ENERGY DROP OR BE DIRECTED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
Gz0MvCmyz7M_7 0 KEEP IT NICE AND STRAIGHT UP
Gz0MvCmyz7M_9 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK FOOT FRONT FOOT BACK FOOT ROLL UP SWITCH THE ARMS
Gz0MvCmyz7M_10 0 BACK FRONT BACK SWITCH THE ARMS
Gz0MvCmyz7M_11 0 AND LEFT RIGHT LEFT ROLL UP ON THAT FOOT SWITCH THE ARMS
Gz0MvCmyz7M_12 0 AND ONE YOU WANT A NICE SMOOTH SWITCH WITH THE BODY AND THE ARMS
Gz0MvCmyz7M_14 0 THE ARMS AREN'T WAVING AROUND THEY'RE MOVING NICE AND SOFT
Gz0MvCmyz7M_15 0 AND ROLL UP
Gz0MvCmyz7M_16 0 AND ONE TWO KEEP THE SHOULDER BLADES DOWN GOOD
Gz0MvCmyz7M_18 0 KEEP IT NICE AND SMOOTH
Gz0MvCmyz7M_20 0 DRILL THAT IN FRONT OF A MIRROR AND SOON YOU'LL HAVE A BEAUTIFUL ROCKING REVERSE UNDULATION WITH L ARMS
GF6ryZbj9WU_1 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ONE OF OUR SMALLER FLAT HEAD BRUSHES AND WE'RE GOING TO APPLY SOME BURNT UMBER TO THE TOP OF IT
GF6ryZbj9WU_2 0 UNLIKE A LOT OF OUR OTHER LAYERS WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY MEDIA
GF6ryZbj9WU_3 0 THIS IS GOING TO BE STRAIGHT PAINT
GF6ryZbj9WU_4 0 SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO USE A LOT OF IT
GF6ryZbj9WU_5 0 WE DON'T NEED IT TO BE ON THERE LIKE COTTON CANDY
GF6ryZbj9WU_6 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE BURNT UMBER AND WE'RE GOING TO START TO APPLY IT IN VARIOUS BRUSHES BACK HERE ON OUR ROCK OUT CROPPINGS
GF6ryZbj9WU_7 0 AND WHAT I WANT TO DO HERE AT THE TOP I BASICALLY WANT TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF SOIL SO YOU CAN SEE THAT'S LIGHTER
GF6ryZbj9WU_8 0 THEN AS WE GO FURTHER DOWN I WANT TO DARKEN THIS LAYER SUBSTANTIALLY
GF6ryZbj9WU_9 0 THIS IS A ROCKY OUT CROPPING OUT THERE
GF6ryZbj9WU_10 0 WE HAVE SOME OF THE LIGHT SOURCES BEHIND THE ROCKERY WHICH MEANS THIS IS GOING TO LOOK MUCH DARKER TO OUR EYES INITIALLY
GF6ryZbj9WU_11 0 NOW SEE HOW THE PREVIOUS LAYER IS BLENDING IN TO WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE
GF6ryZbj9WU_12 0 THAT'S REALLY REALLY GREAT
GF6ryZbj9WU_13 0 OTHERWISE WE JUST PAINT THE WHOLE THING DARK TO BEGIN WITH
GF6ryZbj9WU_14 0 BUT WE WANT THAT TEXTURE THOSE TONES THOSE UNDERLYING COLORS
GF6ryZbj9WU_15 0 THIS IS HOW THINGS LOOK IN REAL LIFE
GF6ryZbj9WU_16 0 AND THE LAST THING ACTUALLY I LIKE TO DO AFTER THAT LAYER IS YOU TAKE YOUR PALETTE KNIFE AND START MAKING SOME LITTLE GOUGES HERE IN THE PAINT
GF6ryZbj9WU_17 0 THIS WILL ADD IN SOME ADDITIONAL TEXTURE
GF6ryZbj9WU_18 0 IT'LL LOOK MORE CRAGGY
GF6ryZbj9WU_19 0 IT'LL LOOK MORE LIKE A ROCKERY SHOULD
GF6ryZbj9WU_20 0 ESPECIALLY ALONG THESE CORNERS AND CREVICES HERE AROUND THE EDGES
GF6ryZbj9WU_21 0 GO ALONG THE EDGE HERE AND DRAG YOUR PALETTE KNIFE
GF6ryZbj9WU_22 0 DON'T PRESS TOO HARD
GF6ryZbj9WU_23 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THE CANVAS
GF6ryZbj9WU_24 0 YOU SEE A MUCH MORE INCREASED TEXTURE AND CREVICE APPEARANCE
hBnhad-oh5M_1 0 IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHEN YOU GO STRAIGHT BACK FOR THE DRIER SNOW IT IS JUST GOING TO LET YOU SLIDE STRAIGHT OVER THE SNOW AND IF THE SNOW IS WETTER YOU ARE GOING TO DO THE FAN PATTERN BECAUSE IT WILL LET THE WATER REPEL OFF TO THE SIDES LIKE A TIRE DOES
hBnhad-oh5M_2 0 I WILL DEMONSTRATE ON ONE SIDE OF THE SNOWBOARD THE STRAIGHT BACK BUFFING PATTERN YOU JUST WANT TO TAKE YOUR BUFFING PAD PRESS IT PRETTY FIRM AND PULL IT STRAIGHT BACK ALONG THE SNOWBOARD
hBnhad-oh5M_3 0 THEN IF IT IS REALLY WET SNOW YOU ARE GOING TO GO IN A FAN PATTERN KIND OF LIKE A RAIN TIRE
hBnhad-oh5M_4 0 YOU ARE JUST GOING TO TAKE YOUR BUFFING PAD AND GO IN FAN MOTIONS DOWN THE BOARD AND IF YOU ARE DOING THE COMPLETE FAN PATTERN ACROSS THE SNOW BOARD YOU CAN GO TO THE OTHER SIDE AND GO THE OPPOSITE WAY SO IT REPELS THE WATER OFF TO THE SIDE
H4pCrLzPN0A_1 0 WE AS HUMAN BEINGS COMMUNICATE WITH BOTH PHYSICAL MOVEMENTS AS WELL AS THE SPOKEN WORD
H4pCrLzPN0A_2 0 ONE OF THE ASPECTS ABOUT IMPROMPTU SPEAKING IS YOUR BODY LANGUAGE ALSO HELPS YOU TO COMMUNICATE WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY
H4pCrLzPN0A_3 0 AND AS YOU WILL NOTICE AS WE HAVE STARTED THIS SERIES OF CLIPS I USE MY HANDS QUITE FREQUENTLY
H4pCrLzPN0A_4 0 THERE ARE MANY OTHER THINGS THAT CAN BE USED IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING A SPEECH
H4pCrLzPN0A_5 0 BUT CERTAINLY THE USE OF THE HANDS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL IN ORDER TO EMPHASIZE AND ALSO SOMETIMES IN ORDER TO POINT YOURSELF IN TO A CERTAIN DIRECTION IN THE SPEECH
H4pCrLzPN0A_6 0 IT HELPS YOU TO EMPHASIZE CERTAIN POINTS BETTER THAN WOULD BE DONE IF YOU WERE TO JUST SPEAK ONLY WITHOUT ANY HAND MOVEMENTS
H4pCrLzPN0A_7 0 AND I'LL GIVE YOU ONE DEMONSTRATION OF THIS
H4pCrLzPN0A_8 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU ONE EXAMPLE WITH HAND MOVEMENTS JUST LIKE I'VE DONE JUST NOW AND I'LL REPEAT THE SAME SITUATION WITHOUT HAND MOVEMENTS
H4pCrLzPN0A_9 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU ONE SITUATION WITH HAND MOVEMENTS
H4pCrLzPN0A_10 0 AND THEN LATER I'LL SHOW YOU THE SITUATION WITHOUT HAND MOVEMENTS
H4pCrLzPN0A_11 0 NOW YOU TELL ME
H4pCrLzPN0A_12 0 WHICH COMMUNICATES THE BETTER MESSAGE
H4pCrLzPN0A_13 0 OF COURSE HAND MOVEMENTS
H4pCrLzPN0A_14 0 DON'T BE AFRAID TO USE YOUR BODY TO HELP YOU EXPRESS WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY
H4pCrLzPN0A_15 0 THAT'S THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF IMPROMPTU SPEAKING
Heh3jXWjXGU_1 0 IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO BE DOING AN OBLIQUE ISOLATION
Heh3jXWjXGU_2 0 NOW THIS HAS NO WEIGHT TO IT SO YOU CAN GET THIS ALMOST ANYWHERE AND IT'S A NICE SIZE AS WELL
Heh3jXWjXGU_3 0 IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A VOIDED BALL
Heh3jXWjXGU_4 0 OK YOU'RE GOING TO SIT DOWN GENTLY ON THE MAT GENTLY ROLL BACK AND YOU'RE GOING TO EXTEND BOTH LEGS UP
Heh3jXWjXGU_5 0 OK TAKE YOUR ARMS TO THE SIDE
Heh3jXWjXGU_6 0 NOW YOU HAVE THE OPTION OF PUTTING THE HANDS BEHIND THE HEAD
Heh3jXWjXGU_7 0 YOU'RE GOING TO REACH ACROSS PAST THAT KNEE FEEL THAT OBLIQUE SQUEEZE AND THEN COME BACK TO YOUR BEGINNING POSITION WITH YOUR ARM NICE AND OPEN AND YOUR SHOULDER RELAXED
Heh3jXWjXGU_8 0 EXHALE AS YOU COME ACROSS AND REACH AND THEN TAKE IT BACK
Heh3jXWjXGU_9 0 NOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE FEELING A LITTLE BIT OF A BURN IN YOUR QUADRICEPS BECAUSE YOUR LEGS ARE ELEVATED
Heh3jXWjXGU_10 0 NOW IF YOU HAVE BACK ISSUES WE ALSO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL OPTION
Heh3jXWjXGU_11 0 YOU CAN TAKE YOUR LEGS TO NINETY DEGREES
Heh3jXWjXGU_12 0 THAT GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE SUPPORT AND PUSHES YOUR BACK A LITTLE FURTHER TOWARDS THE MAT
Heh3jXWjXGU_13 0 AND YOU CAN ALSO CROSS YOUR ANKLES FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT
Heh3jXWjXGU_14 0 NOW IF FOR SOME REASON THAT STILL BOTHERS YOUR BACK YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE YOUR FEET TO THE GROUND AND YOU'LL STILL FEEL THAT ISOLATION OF THE OBLIQUE
Heh3jXWjXGU_16 0 REACH AND RELEASE
Heh3jXWjXGU_17 0 COME ACROSS AND RELEASE
Heh3jXWjXGU_18 0 NOW OUR OTHER OPTION NINETY DEGREES REACH ACROSS AND RELEASE
H10zXoKpvtI_1 0 OKAY THE NEXT BARRIER TO COMMUNICATION IS EXPECTATIONS
H10zXoKpvtI_2 0 AND THIS ONE IS REALLY REALLY HARD BECAUSE WE AS HUMANS REALLY LIKE TO GET WHAT WE WANT
H10zXoKpvtI_3 0 BUT AN EXPECTATION IS GOING INTO SOMETHING WHETHER IT'S A CONVERSATION A RELATIONSHIP WHATEVER IT IS AND YOU WANT TO GET WHAT YOU WANT
H10zXoKpvtI_4 0 YOU HAVE A PRECONCEIVED IDEA OF THE ANSWERS THAT YOU WANT TO RECEIVE SO YOU SAY HEY JIM YOU WANT TO GO TO THE MOVIES ON FRIDAY

H10zXoKpvtI_9 0 IT CAN ESCALATE TO EXTREME PROPORTIONS WHEN ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS GO WITH IT
H10zXoKpvtI_10 0 DON'T ENTER EVERY CONVERSATION IN EVERY RELATIONSHIP WITH AN EXPECTATION WITH WHAT YOU WANT
H10zXoKpvtI_11 0 IT'S OKAY TO HAVE WANTS AND NEEDS BUT WHAT'S NOT OKAY IS GETTING UPSET EVERY TIME THAT EXPECTATION IS NOT FULFILLED IN YOUR RELATIONSHIPS

gYl4jwMT7yM_17 0 IT'S JUST GOING TO GET A LOT SWEETER WITHIN TIME
gYl4jwMT7yM_18 0 IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AS BITTER AS IT IS WHEN IT'S RAW

gtiaeinVHZ8_1 0 LET'S TALK ABOUT WEAKNESS AND RESISTANCE
gtiaeinVHZ8_2 0 WHEN YOU ATTACK OR WHEN YOU ARE DEFENDING YOUR POKEMON HAS A RESISTANCE
gtiaeinVHZ8_3 0 YOUR POKEMON ARE LOCATED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CARD CALLED THE RETREAT CARD
gtiaeinVHZ8_4 0 IF YOU LOOK MY POKEMON HERE HAS A WEAKNESS OF FIGHTING TYPE AND HAS A RESISTANCE TO METAL TYPE POKEMON
gtiaeinVHZ8_5 0 UNLESS THERE IS A NUMBER BESIDE IT THE WEAKNESS OR RESISTANCE IS AUTOMATICALLY TWENTY
gtiaeinVHZ8_6 0 IN THIS POKEMON'S CASE I ACTUALLY HAVE A RESISTANCE TO METAL OF THIRTY
gtiaeinVHZ8_7 0 SO LET'S SAY MY OPPONENT ATTACKS ME WITH THIS NIDERAN WHICH IS ACTUALLY A METAL TYPE POKEMON
gtiaeinVHZ8_8 0 IT MAKES HIS ATTACK AND SCRATCHES FOR TEN
gtiaeinVHZ8_9 0 I HAVE A RESISTANCE OF THIRTY WHICH MEANS I DON'T TAKE ANY DAMAGE AT ALL BECAUSE I TAKE THIRTY OFF WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS THEY ATTACK WITH
gtiaeinVHZ8_10 0 IF HE WERE ATTACKING FOR FORTY FOR THIRTY POINTS OF DAMAGE THEN I WOULD ONLY TAKE TEN BECAUSE MY RESISTANCE IS THIRTY AND THIS IS WHERE THE MATH PLAYS A BIG PART
gtiaeinVHZ8_11 0 IF THE POKEMON THAT IS ATTACKING IS ONE THAT I HAVE A WEAKNESS TO THAT MEANS THAT I AUTOMATICALLY TAKE TWENTY MORE DAMAGE THAN WHAT THE POKEMON IS ATTACKING WITH
gtiaeinVHZ8_12 0 SO IF THIS RHYHORN IS HITTING ME WITH ITS HORN DRILL I AM GOING TO TAKE FORTY POINTS OF DAMAGE NOT JUST TWENTY
H2f7L6y9X6Y_1 0 HI THIS IS JON AND IN THIS CLIP I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT EMERGENCIES
H2f7L6y9X6Y_2 0 IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A PHONE HANDY AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WIRE ONE INTO YOUR SHOP YOU CAN ALWAYS INVEST IN A GOOD CORDLESS PHONE OR YOU CAN USE YOUR CELL PHONE
H2f7L6y9X6Y_3 0 ADDITIONALLY YOU CAN POST THE EMERGENCY NUMBERS NEXT TO YOUR PHONE SO THAT YOU KNOW WHO TO CALL IF YOU NEED HELP
H2f7L6y9X6Y_4 0 IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO LET SOMEONE KNOW THAT YOU ARE WORKING IN THE SHOP SO THAT IF THEY DON'T HEAR FROM YOU IN A WHILE THEY CAN ALWAYS COME CHECK ON YOU
H2f7L6y9X6Y_5 0 ADDITIONALLY YOU CAN INSTALL THOSE INTERCOM SYSTEMS IN YOUR SHOP SO THAT YOU CAN EASILY CONTACT SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE
H2f7L6y9X6Y_6 0 YOU ALWAYS WANT TO HAVE A COUPLE OF GOOD ABC FIRE EXTINGUISHERS HANDY IN YOUR SHOP AND MAKE SURE TO ALWAYS KEEP THEM FULLY CHARGED
H2f7L6y9X6Y_7 0 AND IF ALL ELSE FAILS MAKE SURE YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT EXITS OUT OF YOUR WOOD SHOP
H2f7L6y9X6Y_8 0 ADDITIONALLY YOU ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR FIRST AID KIT LOCATED IN A CENTRALIZED LOCATION AND IT IS FULLY STOCKED
H2f7L6y9X6Y_9 0 MUCH OF THE TIME IT'S BETTER JUST TO STOCK IT YOURSELF THAN TO GO OUT AND BUY ONE THAT WAY YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED
H2f7L6y9X6Y_10 0 AND LASTLY ANOTHER GOOD TIP IS TO ALWAYS HAVE A CHAIR IN YOUR WOOD SHOP AND KEEP IT NEAR BOTH THE PHONE AND THE FIRST AID SUPPLIES
GeeOYGUqjP0_1 0 NOW IF YOU WANT TO WORK WITH COILS BUT YOU'RE NOT QUITE READY TO DO IT FREEHAND OR FREE FORM YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND USE A MOLD
GeeOYGUqjP0_2 0 A REALLY GOOD TYPE OF MATERIAL TO USE FOR A MOLD IS AN EARTHENWARE PLANTER OR A BOWL
GeeOYGUqjP0_3 0 IT WICKS AWAY MOISTURE SO THE POT IS GOING TO DRY EVENLY
GeeOYGUqjP0_4 0 BUT ANY MOLD WILL WORK
GeeOYGUqjP0_5 0 YOU CAN MAKE A PLASTER MOLD ANYTHING YOU WANT TO USE
GeeOYGUqjP0_6 0 AND IT'S THE SAME BASIC IDEA
GeeOYGUqjP0_7 0 I'VE ALREADY DONE THE BOTTOM
GeeOYGUqjP0_8 0 BUT I'M GOING TO LAY THE COILS IN AND JUST PRESS WITH MY THUMB ALL THE WAY AROUND THE POT
GeeOYGUqjP0_9 0 NOW ON THIS TYPE ONLY THE INTERIOR IS GETTING SMOOTHED
GeeOYGUqjP0_10 0 SO THE EXTERIOR IS STILL GOING TO SHOW THE COIL TEXTURE
GeeOYGUqjP0_11 0 THERE'S GOING TO BE CONCENTRIC RINGS
GeeOYGUqjP0_12 0 WHICH I'LL SHOW YOU WHEN I TAKE THIS POT OUT OF THE MOLD
GeeOYGUqjP0_13 0 BUT YOU JUST WANT TO GO AROUND WITH THE COIL
GeeOYGUqjP0_14 0 AND EITHER AT THE VERY END OR AFTER EACH COIL THAT YOU LAY IN YOU CAN TAKE YOUR SPONGE AND JUST SMOOTH THAT OUT
GeeOYGUqjP0_15 0 NOW THE BENEFIT OF USING COILS FOR A PROJECT LIKE THIS IS YOU'RE GOING TO GET REALLY CONSISTENT EVEN WALLS
GeeOYGUqjP0_16 0 AND IT'S ALSO RELATIVELY EASY TO DO
GeeOYGUqjP0_17 0 SO I'M GOING TO FINISH FILLING THIS MOLD OUT WITH THE COILS AND THEN I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE WHEN IT TURNS OUT
GCJfvlG3B_g_1 0 HI I'M TIM GIPSON AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO USE A MICROWAVE
GCJfvlG3B_g_2 0 NOW ONE THING WHEN YOU'RE USING A MICROWAVE ONE THING YOU WANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS NEVER PUT ANYTHING METALLIC INTO YOUR MICROWAVE AND ALSO AS FAR AS PLASTICS ANY PLASTICS YOU WOULD USE IN THE MICROWAVE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S RATED FOR MICROWAVE USE
GCJfvlG3B_g_3 0 FOR INSTANCE THIS SPLATTER SHIELD IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR MICROWAVE USE AND IT'S A GOOD THING IF YOU'RE HEATING UP FOODS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A SPLATTER SHIELD IN THERE BECAUSE FOOD AS IT'S HEATING UP WILL TEND TO POP AND IT WILL HELP KEEP THE INSIDE OF YOUR MICROWAVE CLEAN BY DOING THAT
GCJfvlG3B_g_4 0 SO ONCE WE GET READY TO HEAT SOMETHING UP WE CLOSE THE DOOR AND NOW WE GOT SEVERAL OPTIONS
GCJfvlG3B_g_5 0 WE CAN SET THE TIME AND THE LEVEL OF POWER FOR HEATING WE CAN SELECT AUTOMATIC TIMES THAT ALREADY COOK IT TO ITS HIGHEST LEVEL TEN WITH ONE BEING THE LOWEST LEVEL OF HEATING AND TEN BEING THE HIGHEST AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE SENSOR COOKING
GCJfvlG3B_g_6 0 SO IF WE PUT A BAG OF POPCORN IN WE CAN HIT THE POPCORN BUTTON AND IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY START THE POPCORN AND IT'LL ACTUALLY SENSE AND WHEN YOUR POPCORN'S ABOUT FINISHED POPPING THEN IT WILL ACTUALLY SENSE THAT AND IT'LL ACTUALLY SHUT IT OFF ON TIME SO YOU CAN GET THE PERFECT BAG OF POPCORN EVERY TIME
GCJfvlG3B_g_7 0 YOU CAN ALSO WELL YOU HAVE A POTATO BUTTON WHERE YOU PUT A POTATO IN IT'LL ACTUALLY SET IT FOR THE AUTOMATIC TIME TO COOK A POTATO
GCJfvlG3B_g_8 0 OTHER SENSOR COOKING WE HAVE BEVERAGE AND RE-HEATING BUTTONS
GCJfvlG3B_g_9 0 SO WITH A MICROWAVE YOU COULD ACTUALLY DO A LOT OF AUTOMATIC SETTINGS OR YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO SOME MANUAL SETTING INCLUDING EVEN DOING A DELAYED TIMER
GCJfvlG3B_g_10 0 SO IF YOU DIDN'T WANT YOUR MICROWAVE TO COME ON FOR AN HOUR THEN YOU COULD ACTUALLY SET THIS DELAYED TIME IN THERE
GCJfvlG3B_g_11 0 SO I'M TIM GIPSON THAT'S HOW TO USE A MICROWAVE
Ggm7feLhD5Q_1 0 JASON HARRIS HI I'M JASON WITH EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
Ggm7feLhD5Q_2 0 AND TODAY WE'RE MAKING A BRACELET WITH WIRE AND CABLE RAZORBLADES JUST THINGS I'VE FOUND LYING AROUND
Ggm7feLhD5Q_3 0 SO FAR WE'VE PUT PAINT ON OUR RAZORBLADE AND GLUE SO IT WOULD BE DRYING
Ggm7feLhD5Q_4 0 SO WE HAVE SOME BLOOD ON THERE
Ggm7feLhD5Q_5 0 WE'VE GOT OUR WIRE AND NEXT WE NEED TO TAKE THE COAXIAL CABLE
Ggm7feLhD5Q_6 0 AND THIS IS JUST REGULAR CABLE THAT YOU HAVE HOOKED UP TO YOUR SATELLITE DISH OR YOUR CABLE TV
Ggm7feLhD5Q_7 0 AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO CUT A COUPLE OF PIECES OFF OF THIS THAT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE BEADS OUT OFF
Ggm7feLhD5Q_8 0 WE'RE GOING TO WEAR THIS AS A BRACELET
Ggm7feLhD5Q_9 0 WE DON'T WANT BEADS THAT ARE THE BEADS TO BE VERY BIG
Ggm7feLhD5Q_10 0 SO I'M GOING TO CUT OFF HALF AN INCH OR SO OF THE COAXIAL CABLE WITH JUST A PAIR OF SCISSORS
Ggm7feLhD5Q_11 0 SCISSORS YOU DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT BECAUSE THE WIRE INSIDE CAN MAKE THEM DULL
Ggm7feLhD5Q_12 0 SO I WILL JUST TAKE THAT SCISSORS AND CUT INTO THE WIRE AND NOT TRYING TO CUT ALL THE WAY THROUGH
Ggm7feLhD5Q_13 0 JUST SPIN IT AROUND AND THAT WILL TAKE I'LL TAKE THE OUTSIDE PLASTIC PIECE OFF AND THEN WITH A PAIR OF PLIERS THE CENTER PIECE WILL COME OUT
Ggm7feLhD5Q_14 0 THERE'S ALL THESE LITTLE WIRES INSIDE AND THE COPPER WIRE AND YOU DON'T WANT ANY OF THOSE
Ggm7feLhD5Q_15 0 SO YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO TAKE IT APART LIKE THIS
Ggm7feLhD5Q_16 0 CUT TWO OF THESE OFF AND DO THEM BOTH THE SAME WAY
Ggm7feLhD5Q_17 0 TRY NOT TO CUT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE WIRE JUST CLAMP DOWN ON AND TWIST THE SCISSORS AROUND THE WIRE UNTIL IT'S READY TO COME OFF
Ggm7feLhD5Q_18 0 PULL THE TOP PIECE OFF AND WITH PLIERS PULL THE PLASTIC PIECE OFF
Ggm7feLhD5Q_19 0 WE'LL CLEAN THEM UP AND MAKE THEM SHAPED MORE LIKE BEADS NEXT
gUiuLTo7jmM_1 0 COURTESY IS CONTAGIOUS
gUiuLTo7jmM_2 0 A LACK OF COURTESY CAN BE DANGEROUS
gUiuLTo7jmM_3 0 WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF AN EMOTIONALLY ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP
gUiuLTo7jmM_4 0 THIS IS DR PAUL AUTHOR OF BOOMER GIRLS A BOOMER WOMENS GUIDE TO MEN AND DATING NATIONAL TALK SHOW HOST RELATIONSHIP CONSULTANT AND I CAN TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS WITH DISCOURTESY
gUiuLTo7jmM_5 0 THAT'S HOW IT STARTS
gUiuLTo7jmM_6 0 THE FIRST SIGNS THAT YOU WILL SEE IN AN EMOTIONALLY ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP WHETHER THAT ABUSER IS MALE OR FEMALE IS A LACK OF COURTESY
gUiuLTo7jmM_7 0 IT'S ALL ABOUT THEM
gUiuLTo7jmM_8 0 THEIR LEVEL OF GIVING IS LOW IF YOU GIVE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A CARD OR A FLOWER OR A TOKEN OF SOME SORT AND THAT PERSON DOES NOT RECIPROCATE AT SOME POINT
gUiuLTo7jmM_9 0 AND YOU SEE THE LACK OF COURTESY WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND ULTIMATELY WITH YOU MAYBE EVEN ABUSIVENESS WITH ANIMALS FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON
gUiuLTo7jmM_10 0 KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO GET BETTER
gUiuLTo7jmM_11 0 IT'S NOT A TOPICAL THING
gUiuLTo7jmM_12 0 THOSE SIGNS EARLY ON ARE WARNINGS TO YOU THAT THIS IS AN EMOTIONALLY ABUSIVE PERSON
gUiuLTo7jmM_13 0 WHETHER IT'S A MALE OR A FEMALE IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE A MAN
gUiuLTo7jmM_14 0 OFTEN TIMES WE THINK OF THE MAN BEING ABUSIVE IT OFTEN TIMES CAN BE THE WOMAN AS WELL
gUiuLTo7jmM_15 0 SO KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE SIGNS ARE THERE FOR YOU TO RECOGNIZE AND REMEMBER WHAT DR PAUL SAYS THE FIRST SIGN IS THAT LACK OF COURTESY
gUiuLTo7jmM_17 0 THAT'S THE STEP THAT STARTS THAT PERSON ON THE ROAD TO EMOTIONAL ABUSIVENESS AND GUESS WHAT THEY'VE DONE IT BEFORE
gUiuLTo7jmM_18 0 THIS IS DR PAUL MAY YOUR FANTASIES OF TODAY BE YOUR REALITIES OF TOMORROW

GEtf-QBtfBg_4 0 THIS IS DOCTOR PAUL AUTHOR OF BOOMER GIRLS A BOOMER WOMAN'S GUIDE TO MEN AND DATING AND HOST OF ASK DOCTOR PAUL
GEtf-QBtfBg_5 0 WELL WHAT IT MEANS TO LOVE SOMEONE IS DOING PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE
GEtf-QBtfBg_6 0 YOU CAN'T TELL THE BIG LIE AND TELL IT OFTEN ENOUGH AND EXPECT IT TO BE BELIEVED BECAUSE IT WON'T BE
GEtf-QBtfBg_7 0 BASICALLY IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO BE ABSOLUTELY STRAIGHT WITH THAT PERSON AND IF YOU'RE ABLE TO DO THAT WITHOUT ANY OBFUSCATION ON YOUR PART THEN THE PROBABILITY IS THAT YOU'RE THERE
GEtf-QBtfBg_8 0 YOU REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT
GEtf-QBtfBg_9 0 BEING HONEST WITH YOURSELF AS WELL AS WITH THE OTHER REALLY GETS THE JOB DONE
GEtf-QBtfBg_10 0 IT'S NOT A WALLPAPERING OVER OF ANYTHING
GEtf-QBtfBg_11 0 IT'S NOT A CREATING AN IMAGE OF ANYTHING

G9-j3ZoWkKE_1 0 HI THIS IS VICKIE PAVON ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE THIS CLIP IS ON IRONING PLEATS
G9-j3ZoWkKE_2 0 TO IRON MULTIPLE PLEATS YOUR GOING TO FOLD YOUR PLEAT GET IT FLAT HOLD IT WITH YOUR HAND PUT YOUR IRON DOWN AND RUN ALONG YOUR PLEAT JUST RUN TO THE END
G9-j3ZoWkKE_3 0 IF YOU HAVE A SECOND PLEAT AND DON'T WANT GO ANY FURTHER AND DON'T WANT TO HARSH ENDING
G9-j3ZoWkKE_4 0 HOLD THEM BOTH TOGETHER ONCE AGAIN AND AS YOU IRON INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE EDGE MOVE YOUR IRON OVER AND GO TO YOUR PLEAT THAT YOU WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THIS LEAVES A SOFT ENDING TO YOUR PLEAT AS OPPOSE TO A HARD END WHERE IT LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE A DART
G9-j3ZoWkKE_5 0 IF YOU GOT A POCKET NEXT TO YOUR PLEATS YOU CAN IRON ALL AT THE SAME TIME
G9-j3ZoWkKE_6 0 FOLD YOUR PLEATS DOWN START AT THE TOP AND JUST FOLD ROLL YOUR IRON TOWARDS YOUR POCKET YOUR GOING STRAIGHT DOWN GO DOWN YOUR PLEAT
G9-j3ZoWkKE_7 0 AND NOW YOU HAVE PERFECTLY IRON PLEATS
gSBb8mSo9Ao_1 0 I'M JENNIFER MILLER WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR REALITY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gSBb8mSo9Ao_2 0 ONE OF THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS THAT WE GET FROM FAMILIES THAT ARE NEW TO HOME SCHOOLING OR VERY SKEPTICAL OF HOME SCHOOLING IS HOW DO YOU TEACH THOSE THINGS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT
gSBb8mSo9Ao_3 0 IF YOU FAILED HIGH SCHOOL GEOGRAPHY AND YOU CAN'T NAME ALL THE STATES AND CAPITALS AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SEVEN CONTINENTS ARE THEN HOW ARE YOU POSSIBLY GOING TO TEACH GEOGRAPHY TO YOUR CHILD AT HOME
gSBb8mSo9Ao_4 0 A QUESTION THAT CAN BE ASKED IN RESPONSE TO THAT IS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CAPITAL OF BRAZIL IS HOW WOULD YOU FIND OUT
gSBb8mSo9Ao_5 0 WHAT WAS YOUR ANSWER
gSBb8mSo9Ao_6 0 WOULD YOU SEARCH ON GOOGLE
gSBb8mSo9Ao_7 0 WOULD YOU GO TO THE LIBRARY
gSBb8mSo9Ao_8 0 WOULD YOU USE AN ATLAS
gSBb8mSo9Ao_9 0 ANY OF THOSE ANSWERS WOULD NOT ONLY PROVIDE THE ANSWER TO WHAT THE CAPITAL OF BRAZIL IS BUT IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE THE ANSWER TO HOW TO TEACH GEOGRAPHY WHEN YOU YOURSELF DON'T KNOW IT
gSBb8mSo9Ao_10 0 IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY PERSON TO TEACH THE WHOLE BODY OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE TO ANOTHER PERSON
gSBb8mSo9Ao_11 0 IT GROWS EXPONENTIALLY EVERY YEAR
gSBb8mSo9Ao_12 0 AND AN EDUCATED PERSON IS NOT SOMEONE WHO KNOWS ALL OF THE PERTINENT FACTS ABOUT EVERY SUBJECT
gSBb8mSo9Ao_13 0 AN EDUCATED PERSON IS SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO LEARN AND WHO LIVES A LIFESTYLE OF LEARNING
gSBb8mSo9Ao_14 0 SO IF YOU ARE AN EDUCATED PERSON AND YOU KNOW HOW TO LEARN THEN YOU WILL KNOW HOW TO FIND THE INFORMATION THAT YOU DON'T KNOW
gSBb8mSo9Ao_15 0 ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE TEACH THE SUBJECTS THAT WE ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH AND WE'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH IS BY FINDING SOMEONE WHO DOES KNOW HOW TO TEACH THOSE THINGS AND TEACHING THEM TO OUR CHILDREN
gSBb8mSo9Ao_16 0 DESIGNING AN EDUCATION IS NOT SO MUCH ABOUT WHAT TO INCLUDE AS TO WHAT NOT TO INCLUDE
gSBb8mSo9Ao_17 0 IF IT'S A PUBLIC EDUCATION A PRIVATE EDUCATION A HOME EDUCATION SOMEONE HAS MADE THE DECISION OF WHAT IS IMPORTANT FOR A CHILD TO LEARN AT A CERTAIN POINT AND HOW TO TEACH IT AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE OUT
gSBb8mSo9Ao_18 0 HOME EDUCATING YOUR CHILD IS NOT ABOUT KNOWING EVERYTHING AND KNOWING HOW TO TEACH EVERYTHING YOURSELF
gSBb8mSo9Ao_19 0 IT'S ABOUT CUSTOM DESIGNING A PERFECT EDUCATION FOR YOUR CHILD AT THE STAGE THAT HE IS AT
gSBb8mSo9Ao_20 0 IF TEACHING GEOGRAPHY SCARES YOU MAKE FRIENDS WITH YOUR ATLAS
gSBb8mSo9Ao_21 0 START DOING SOME READING ABOUT CULTURES
gSBb8mSo9Ao_22 0 START LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE
gSBb8mSo9Ao_23 0 AND BEFORE VERY LONG YOUR ENTHUSIASM FOR WHAT YOU ARE LEARNING WILL OVERFLOW INTO YOUR HOME SCHOOL
gSBb8mSo9Ao_24 0 AND YOU WILL FIND WAYS TO TEACH YOUR CHILD GEOGRAPHY
HHjSqT4gX6k_1 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE GRIP AND THE PROPER CONDITION OF IT
HHjSqT4gX6k_2 0 YOU WANT A GRIP THAT IS KIND OF STICKY SO IT DOESN'T SHIFT BETWEEN YOUR HAND NOT GLUE BUT REALLY NICE
HHjSqT4gX6k_3 0 WE TALK ABOUT THE DISTANCE ONE FINGER BETWEEN
HHjSqT4gX6k_4 0 THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A GOOD GRIP
HHjSqT4gX6k_5 0 TO MAKE IT GOOD YOU NORMALLY WANT TO HAVE AN UNDER GRIP WHICH IS GOING TO BE YOUR BASIC AND UNDER THAT UNDER GRIP YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A THIN LAYER OF AN OVER GRIP THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GRAB AROUND THE RACKET
HHjSqT4gX6k_6 0 FOR EXAMPLE TRACY'S RACKET ONLY HAS THE UNDER GRIP AND SEE AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S GETTING WORN OUT
HHjSqT4gX6k_7 0 THIS IS GOING TO GIVE HER TROUBLE HAVING A GOOD GRIP AND STAYING ON HER HAND
HHjSqT4gX6k_8 0 SHE'S PROBABLY STILL GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT
HHjSqT4gX6k_9 0 SEE HERE IT'S REALLY GONE
HHjSqT4gX6k_10 0 SO WHAT I WOULD DO
HHjSqT4gX6k_11 0 I WOULD TAKE THIS OUT
HHjSqT4gX6k_12 0 I WOULD PUT AN UNDER GRIP AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT I WOULD PUT AN OVER GRIP
HHjSqT4gX6k_13 0 THE OVER GRIP GIVES YOU PROTECTION BECAUSE IN CASE YOU'RE PLAYING A MATCH AND YOU'RE OVER GRIP IS GETTING REALLY BAD YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE IT OUT AND THEN HAVE YOUR UNDER GRIP THERE AND READY TO PLAY AGAIN
HHjSqT4gX6k_14 0 THESE ARE THE BASICS OF UNDER GRIP AND OVER GRIP

gks026XP8SA_4 0 YOU COULD DO LIKE THIS NOT MUCH ATTITUDE OR YOU CAN DO LIKE THIS FAR MORE ATTITUDE
gks026XP8SA_5 0 MY DANCING IS OK BUT IT'S WHAT I BRING OUTSIDE FROM THE INSIDE THAT MAKES MY DANCING LOOK FABULOUS
gks026XP8SA_6 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE DOING ROUTINE OR IN MY CLASS DOING CARDIO-CABARET I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT ATTITUDE
gks026XP8SA_7 0 I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT SOMEONE WHO'S OVER THE TOP CHER TINA TURNER PINK
gks026XP8SA_8 0 ANYBODY WHO YOU CAN THINK WHO'S OVER THE TOP AND I WANT YOU TO EMBODY THAT PERSON AND TRY TO BE THEM
gks026XP8SA_9 0 SOMETIMES WHEN I'M TALKING I THINK THAT I'M SOMEBODY ELSE AND WHEN I'M DANCING I AM THE MOST FABULOUS PERSON IN THE WHOLE WORLD
gks026XP8SA_10 0 AND THAT REALLY CHANGES THE WAY THE ROUTINE LOOKS THE WAY THE DANCE LOOKS THE SAME WITH POSTURE
gks026XP8SA_11 0 THIS IS A CLOSED POSTURE
gks026XP8SA_12 0 I'M FEARFUL I'M AFRAID
gks026XP8SA_13 0 I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT BRINGING YOUR CHEST OUT BRINGING YOUR STOMACH IN MAKING THE NECK LONG
gks026XP8SA_14 0 THIS WOULD SUGGEST CONFIDENCE AND WHEN YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE PEOPLE TEND TO LOOK AT YOU
gks026XP8SA_15 0 ALSO WHEN YOU HAVE THIS TYPE OF POSTURE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN DO A MOVEMENT THAT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL AS OPPOSED TO I DON'T LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL I THINK I'M JUST GOING TO BE IN A SHELL

Gi_7dJl0hvY_1 0 NEXT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO PARALLEL PARK
Gi_7dJl0hvY_2 0 I'M GOING TO PULL UP HERE AND PARALLEL PARK BEHIND THIS CAR
Gi_7dJl0hvY_3 0 SO YOU ARE GOING TO PULL UP TO THE CAR AND YOU ARE GOING T TURN YOUR SIGNAL ON
Gi_7dJl0hvY_4 0 YOU ARE GOING TO PULL UP NEXT TO THE CAR UNTIL YOUR REAR TIRES ARE PRETTY MUCH AT THE REAR OF THE CAR THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE PARKING BEHIND AND THEN YOU ARE GOING TO PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE TURN YOUR WHEELS AND SLOWLY START BACKING UP AND THEN ONCE YOU GET ABOUT HALF WAY BACK TOWARDS THE CURB AND YOUR FRONT TIRES ARE CLEAR OF THE CAR IN FRONT OF YOU THEN YOU ARE GOING TO START STEERING BACK THE OTHER WAY AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO JUST SLIDE RIGHT IN THERE AND BE RIGHT BEHIND THE CAR
Gi_7dJl0hvY_5 0 IF THERE IS ANYONE BEHIND YOU OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR THEM AS WELL AS YOU ARE PULLING INTO THE SPACE TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMEONE IS NOT GOING TO REAR END YOU
Gi_7dJl0hvY_6 0 SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL TRY TO GO AROUND YOU WHEN YOU ARE PARALLEL PARKING AND NOT REALIZING THAT YOUR FRONT END IS GOING TO SWING OUT
Gi_7dJl0hvY_7 0 AS YOU ARE BACKING UP IF THERE IS A CAR BEHIND YOU YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH CLEARANCE TO GET INTO THE SPACE
Gi_7dJl0hvY_8 0 GENERALLY YOU WANT THE SPACE THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO PULL INTO TO BE ABOUT ONE AND A HALF TIMES THE LENGTH OF YOUR CAR
Gi_7dJl0hvY_9 0 IF IT IS ANY SHORTER THAN THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET INTO
Gi_7dJl0hvY_10 0 IF IT IS BIGGER THAN THAT OF COURSE NO PROBLEM YOU CAN GET IN USUALLY PRETTY EASY AND THAT IS IT ON PARALLEL PARKING
Gi_7dJl0hvY_11 0 IT IS PRETTY EASY
gmCXgBJGCzc_1 0 TO BECOME A STATE PARK RANGER IN UTAH PROBABLY THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON IS YOUR EDUCATION
gmCXgBJGCzc_2 0 THEY DO REQUIRE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE
gmCXgBJGCzc_3 0 THEY TYPICALLY LIKE IT IN RECREATION MANAGEMENT TYPE OF DEGREE
gmCXgBJGCzc_4 0 YOU CAN A LOT OF UNIVERSITIES OUT THERE HAVE GOOD RECREATIONAL PROGRAMS SO IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT YOU HAVE TO COME TO UTAH AND GO THROUGH A UNIVERSITY IN UTAH
gmCXgBJGCzc_5 0 ANY UNIVERSITY WILL HAVE A GOOD RECREATIONAL PROGRAM SO THAT IS THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO CONSIDER
gmCXgBJGCzc_6 0 THE SECOND THING YOU NEED TO CONSIDER IS THAT YOU DO NEED TO GO THROUGH THE POLICE ACADEMY SO THAT YOU WOULD BECOME A FULL FLEDGED POLICE OFFICER IN UTAH AND YOU NEED TO DO THAT THAT IS TYPICALLY A FOUR MONTH PROGRAM HERE IN UTAH
gmCXgBJGCzc_7 0 WHEN YOU GET DONE WITH YOUR PROGRAM OR THE POLICE ACADEMY YOU WOULD GO TO YOUR PARK AND GO THROUGH WHAT WE CALL A FIELD TRAINING PROGRAM
gmCXgBJGCzc_8 0 A FIELD TRAINING PROGRAM IS WHERE YOU ARE WITH AN OFFICER MOST OF YOUR TIME AND THEY EVALUATE YOU AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN DO THE JOB PROPERLY AND HELP YOU OUT BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO KNOW EVERYTHING ONCE YOU GET OUT OF THE ACADEMY
gmCXgBJGCzc_9 0 SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU DO THAT YOU'LL NEED TO CONSIDER IF YOU WANT TO BECOME A PARK RANGER IN UTAH
gmCXgBJGCzc_10 0 SOME OTHER SKILLS THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE IS YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME BASIC MAINTENANCE SKILLS PROBABLY SOME BASIC ACCOUNTING SKILLS
gmCXgBJGCzc_11 0 THOSE THINGS THAT WE MENTIONED A LITTLE EARLIER
gmCXgBJGCzc_12 0 WE DO SOME OTHER THINGS BESIDES LAW ENFORCEMENT
gmCXgBJGCzc_13 0 AGAIN WE DO ACCOUNTING AT THE PARKS WE TAKE CARE OF MONEY WE DO A LOT OF MAINTENANCE SO AS A PARK RANGER YOU ARE WEARING A LOT OF HATS SO IF YOU CAN COME TO THIS JOB WITH SOME EXPERIENCE IN SOME OF THOSE OTHER FIELDS THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE AS WELL
gmCXgBJGCzc_14 0 WE ALSO HAVE SOME COMPUTER PROGRAMS THAT WE USE SO THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT PARK RANGERS DO THAT PROBABLY NORMAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DON'T DO AND THAT IS JUST TYPICAL AND PART OF THE JOB AND THAT IS KIND OF A GOOD THING BECAUSE IT BREAKS UP THE MONOTONY MOST OF THE TIME BECAUSE YOU CAN BE DOING ONE THING AND THEN HAVE TO SWITCH HATS SO IT IS A GOOD JOB
GH85DFsKPZU_1 0 ALRIGHT WHEN I WATERED BOTH THESE PLANTS IN I USED A LITTLE FERTILIZER
GH85DFsKPZU_2 0 SEE MY FERTILIZER IS A LITTLE BLUE
GH85DFsKPZU_3 0 I DID THAT BECAUSE WHEN THE PLANTS START GROWING THEIR ROOTS I WANT SOME NUTRIENTS THAT ARE READILY AVAILABLE TO THEM
GH85DFsKPZU_4 0 THERE'S SOMETHING FOR THEM TO START GROWING ON WITH
GH85DFsKPZU_5 0 YOU CAN USE ANY GENERAL-PURPOSE FERTILIZER FROM A GARDEN CENTER
GH85DFsKPZU_6 0 THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY FOR HOUSEPLANTS INDOOR OUTDOOR HIGH ACID
GH85DFsKPZU_7 0 I THINK JUST A GENERAL ALL-PURPOSE WILL BE FINE LIKE A TWENTY TEN TWENTY
GH85DFsKPZU_8 0 I WOULD USE IT FULL STRENGTH
GH85DFsKPZU_9 0 YOU CAN WATER WITH EVERY WATERING OR ONCE A MONTH
GH85DFsKPZU_10 0 IT'S HOW FAST YOU WANT YOUR PLANTS TO GROW
GH85DFsKPZU_11 0 IF YOU WANT THEM TO REALLY TAKE OFF YOU COULD USE FERTILIZER WITH EVERY WATERING
GH85DFsKPZU_12 0 IF YOU DON'T WANT A PLANT THAT'S GOING TO BECOME OVERGROWN YOU COULD FERTILIZE IT A LITTLE LESS
GH85DFsKPZU_13 0 I WOULD SUGGEST MAYBE ONCE A MONTH WOULD WE FINE
GGfrwVp6K_s_1 0 WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT HERE IS A LADY THAT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME LONG LAYERS IN HER HAIR
GGfrwVp6K_s_2 0 IT'S A VERY SIMPLE STYLE BUT IT HELPS ADD A LITTLE BIT OF DESIGN TO WHAT COULD JUST BE A LONG STRAIGHT HAIRSTYLE OR IF YOU WANT TO CURL IT AT THE ENDS JUST TO ADD A LITTLE BIT OF FUN
GGfrwVp6K_s_3 0 BUT WHENEVER WE DO LONG LAYERS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS SECTION OFF THE HAIR FIRST
GGfrwVp6K_s_4 0 IF YOU DO THIS YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS WITH ANY TYPE OF LAYERING HAIRSTYLE
GGfrwVp6K_s_5 0 JUST KIND OF TAKE THE HAIR PART IT AND PUT IT UP GET IT OUT OF YOUR WAY
GGfrwVp6K_s_6 0 OF COURSE DO THE SAME ON THE OTHER SIDE
GGfrwVp6K_s_7 0 WHAT I'M DOING IS I'M PARTING IT AT ABOUT RIGHT ABOUT AT HER EAR LEVEL OVER HERE ON THIS SIDE
GGfrwVp6K_s_8 0 AND I'M REPEATING THE SAME ALL AROUND JUST TO MAKE SURE SHE GETS A NICE EVEN CUT
GGfrwVp6K_s_9 0 JUST TAKE THE HAIR AND PUT IT UP OUT OF THE WAY
GGfrwVp6K_s_10 0 COMB OUT THIS HAIR AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS LAYING NICE AND FLAT NICE AND STRAIGHT
GGfrwVp6K_s_11 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO CHECK OUR ENDS AGAIN JUST TO MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING EVEN IN OUR TRIM
GGfrwVp6K_s_12 0 THAT'S PRETTY GOOD
GGfrwVp6K_s_13 0 SHE HAS A NICE ANGLE GOING FOR SOME TAPERING WORK GOING IN THE FRONT
GGfrwVp6K_s_14 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF THIS HAIR DOWN
GGfrwVp6K_s_15 0 JUST KIND OF WORK YOUR THUMBS AROUND THE SIDE OF HER HEAD TO PULL A LITTLE BIT OF HAIR DOWN
GGfrwVp6K_s_16 0 JUST WORK YOUR FINGERS AROUND
GGfrwVp6K_s_17 0 AND GO AHEAD AND PUT YOUR CLIP UP AND WE'LL BE READY TO START OUR FIRST LAYER

GKGowfB3JzY_1 0 OKAY WE'RE TALKING WE'RE BACK LEARNING ABOUT BEGINNING TO PLAY THE UPRIGHT BASS
GKGowfB3JzY_2 0 AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE BOW AND THE ROSIN THAT YOU USE TO MAKE THE BOW ACTIVATE THE STRING
GKGowfB3JzY_3 0 THE BASS IS UNIQUE AMONG THE STRING INSTRUMENTS
GKGowfB3JzY_4 0 THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF BOWS
GKGowfB3JzY_5 0 THIS FIRST IS CALLED THE FRENCH BOW AND YOU'LL NOTICE IT'S PRETTY MUCH JUST SHAPED LIKE A LARGE VIOLIN BOW AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH HOW YOU HOLD IT JUST LIKE A LARGE VIOLIN BOW
GKGowfB3JzY_6 0 YOU WANT TO GET YOUR FINGERS ALONG THE TOP EDGE AND YOUR THUMB BALANCING IT
GKGowfB3JzY_7 0 NOW THE ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THE BOW YOU HAVE THE STICK AND YOU HAVE THE HAIR
GKGowfB3JzY_8 0 AND AT THIS END WHICH IS CALLED THE FROG YOU HAVE THE KNOB TO TIGHTEN AND LOOSEN THE HAIR
GKGowfB3JzY_9 0 AND YOU WANT TO GET THAT TIGHTENED UP A FEW TURNS TILL THERE'S SOME TENSION ON THERE AND YOU CAN'T QUITE PUSH IT TO THE STICK TOO EASILY
GKGowfB3JzY_10 0 WHEN YOU'RE DONE PLAYING YOU JUST WANT TO LOOSEN THAT THREE TIMES
GKGowfB3JzY_11 0 YOU HOLD THE BOW SUCH AND JUST DRAW IT ACROSS THE STRING LIKE SO
GKGowfB3JzY_12 0 NOW THE OTHER TYPE OF BOW THAT YOU'LL SEE IS CALLED THE GERMAN BOW
GKGowfB3JzY_13 0 AND THIS IS HELD IN AN UNDERHAND STYLE LIKE SO
GKGowfB3JzY_14 0 OTHERWISE EVERYTHING IS THE SAME
GKGowfB3JzY_15 0 YOU HAVE THE STICK WHICH YOU'LL NOTICE IS CURVED INWARD BY A GREAT DEGREE THE HAIR AND AT THIS END THE KNOB TO TIGHTEN THE HAIR
GKGowfB3JzY_16 0 THIS BOW IS HELD UNDERHAND
GKGowfB3JzY_17 0 YOU'RE GOING TO PUT A COUPLE OF YOUR FINGERS IN BETWEEN THE HAIR AND THE STICK
GKGowfB3JzY_18 0 AGAIN BALANCE IT IN YOUR HAND AND YOU'LL DRAW IT LIKE SO ACROSS THE STRING
GKGowfB3JzY_19 0 THOSE ARE THE TWO BOWS
GKGowfB3JzY_20 0 NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO PLAYING SOME NOTES ON OUR BASS

Gae3w4TYuvE_1 0 WE JUST POPPED OUR CUPCAKES BACK IN WE'RE BACK TO THE ICING WE HAD A LITTLE TIMING WITH THE OVEN SO I HAD TO LEAVE THE ICING FOR A SECOND TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE
Gae3w4TYuvE_2 0 NOW LET'S FINISH THESE UP
Gae3w4TYuvE_3 0 I MELTED THAT CHOCOLATE WHICH I'LL GRAB IN A SECOND
Gae3w4TYuvE_4 0 NOW THE STAR OF THIS ICING IS THE PEANUT BUTTER WE USE A CUP OF IT
Gae3w4TYuvE_5 0 JUST A LITTLE TRICK REAL QUICK SPRAY YOUR CUP DOWN WITH A LITTLE COOKING SPRAY FIRST CAUSE IF YOU HAVE EVER MEASURED PEANUT BUTTER BEFORE HALF OF IT STAYS IN THE MEASURING CUP
Gae3w4TYuvE_6 0 BUT IT'S A PAIN IN THE NECK AMONG OTHER THINGS SO WE ARE JUST GOING TO SPREAD THAT DOWN AND THEN MEASURE IT OUT
Gae3w4TYuvE_7 0 TRUST ME IT WILL COME OUT MUCH MUCH EASIER YOU WANT A CUP OF THIS PEANUT BUTTER I LOVE PEANUT BUTTER
Gae3w4TYuvE_8 0 SO LET'S GET THAT IN THERE YEAH IT'S COMING OUT MUCH EASIER YOU SEE HOW THAT JUST CAME RIGHT OUT I'M NOT FIGHTING WITH IT LIKE I WOULD OF BUT I SPRAYED IT DOWN SO THAT HELPS A LOT
Gae3w4TYuvE_9 0 SO WE HAVE OUR PEANUT BUTTER OUR STAR NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD A TABLESPOON OF MILK MY GIANT HEARTS SIDE OF MILK AND STICK OF ROOM TEMPERATURE BUTTER
Gae3w4TYuvE_10 0 REMEMBER I TALK A LOT ABOUT HAVING ROOM TEMPERATURE BUTTER WHEN YOU'RE BAKING THIS CAUSE YOU WANT TO MIX TOGETHER MELTED BUTTER WE DON'T WANT THAT FOR THIS BUT WE DO WANT IT TO BE SOFT SO IT WILL WHIP IN THERE NICELY
Gae3w4TYuvE_11 0 I'LL PUT THIS MELTED BUTTER IN GRAB MY CHOCOLATE AND MIX IT IN ALL TOGETHER
HexmLIZqxiA_1 0 THIS NEXT GRIP THAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS USED BY JIM FURYK ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST PLAYERS AND I'M SURPRISED THAT IT'S NOT TALKED ABOUT MORE
HexmLIZqxiA_2 0 I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY MORE PEOPLE DON'T USE IT BUT I'M SURPRISED THAT IS ISN'T TALKED ABOUT MORE
HexmLIZqxiA_3 0 YOU KNOW THE OVERLAP GRIP
HexmLIZqxiA_4 0 WHERE YOUR PINKY GOES BETWEEN THE MIDDLE FINGER AND FOREFINGER
HexmLIZqxiA_5 0 WELL MOVE THAT PINKY DOWN ONE AND MOVE YOUR RING FINGER INTO THAT SLOT AND WHAT YOU HAVE IS THE DOUBLE OVERLAP GRIP
HexmLIZqxiA_6 0 TO MAKE THIS WORK YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE STRONG
HexmLIZqxiA_7 0 YOU HAVE TO HAVE VERY ACTIVE HANDS BECAUSE IT'S MAKING YOU USE YOUR HANDS LESS
HexmLIZqxiA_8 0 THE REASON THE OVERLAP GRIP WAS INVENTED IS THAT THE TEN FINGER GRIP THERE WAS TOO MUCH HANDS THAT WORK INDIVIDUALLY
HexmLIZqxiA_9 0 AND THEN HARRY VARDEN THE OVERLAP GRIP THE VARDEN GRIP
HexmLIZqxiA_10 0 NOW THE HANDS MOVE MORE TOGETHER MORE IN A UNIT
HexmLIZqxiA_11 0 WELL THE DOUBLE OVERLAP GRIP DOUBLES THAT SOLIDARITY
HexmLIZqxiA_12 0 YOU'RE HANDS WORKING TOGETHER BUT ONCE AGAIN IF YOU DO THAT IT TAKES AWAY QUITE A BIT OF POWER BECAUSE INSTEAD OF HAVING TEN FINGERS ON THE CLUB OR NINE YOU NOW HAVE EIGHT
HexmLIZqxiA_13 0 AND IF YOU THINK THAT THAT MIGHT NOT GIVE YOU LESS POWER PICK UP A BASEBALL BAT AND HOLD IT WITH A DOUBLE OVERLAP AND SEE HOW MUCH POWER YOU LOSE
HexmLIZqxiA_14 0 THE DOUBLE OVERLAP IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN TRY SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD KID AROUND WITH ESPECIALLY IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU'RE TOO HANDSY AND TOO WRISTY
HexmLIZqxiA_15 0 ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE SUPER STRONG YOU'RE A WEIGHTLIFTER AND YOU'RE JUST SO STRONG THAT YOU COULD GET AWAY WITH IT
HexmLIZqxiA_16 0 BUT THIS CERTAINLY WILL GET YOUR HANDS TO WORK TOGETHER MORE
HexmLIZqxiA_17 0 JIM FURYK'S DOUBLE OVERLAP GRIP
hHwWoZ9wWoI_2 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD THE LAST FOUR INGREDIENTS
hHwWoZ9wWoI_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH A TEASPOON OF ONION POWDER
hHwWoZ9wWoI_4 0 AND THEN A TEASPOON OF CAYENNE
hHwWoZ9wWoI_5 0 NOW IF YOU'RE NOT A FAN OF SPICY FOOD I WOULDN'T REALLY WORRY ABOUT THIS THAT MUCH BECAUSE ALL OF THE OTHER FLAVORS IN THE SPICES ARE REALLY GOING TO THE CAYENNE COULDN'T IN THE BACK OF YOUR THROAT NOT REALLY IN THE FRONT OF YOUR TONGUE AND BURN YOUR MOUTH PLUS IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE IN THE CREAM SAUCE AND THAT WOULD MELLOW IT OUT EVEN FURTHER
hHwWoZ9wWoI_6 0 WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PUT IN A TEASPOON OF DRIED OREGANO AND AGAIN IF YOU WANT TO USE FRESH OREGANO THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE
hHwWoZ9wWoI_7 0 WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD FOR OUR LAST INGREDIENT AND ADD THYME

hHwWoZ9wWoI_9 0 YOU CAN RUB IT UNTIL THE LEAVES FALL OFF OR YOU CAN PULL IT BACK AND PULL THE LEAVES OFF OR IF YOU HAVE A SHARP KNIFE YOU CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND CUT ALL OF IT STEMS AND ALL
hHwWoZ9wWoI_10 0 LET THAT TO THE MIXTURE AND THEN WE'LL STIR IT UP MAKING SURE TO GET IT COMPLETELY BLENDED
HaMevfQiOu8_1 0 CODY KIMMEL HI
HaMevfQiOu8_2 0 MY NAME IS CODY KIMMEL
HaMevfQiOu8_3 0 I'M THE LEAD SINGER OF THE BAND ELIOT FITZGERALD AND I'M HERE WITH EXPERT VILLAGE TO TEACH YOU HOW TO WRITE A COUNTRY SONG
HaMevfQiOu8_4 0 LET'S GET AN EXAMPLE OF A PRE-CHORUS COMING OUT OF THE BRIDGE
HaMevfQiOu8_5 0 NOW LIKE I SAID THE BRIDGE THAT WE'RE WRITING RIGHT NOW THIS IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO
HaMevfQiOu8_6 0 YOU CAN HAVE A DIFFERENT FEEL
HaMevfQiOu8_7 0 THE BRIDGE IS OR THE PRE-CHORUS THAT I'M WRITING NOW IS GOING TO BE A WALK DOWN SIMPLE A LITTLE BIT MORE MAJOR AND HAPPIER-SOUNDING THAN THE MORE MINOR AND SAD-SOUNDING VERSE
HaMevfQiOu8_8 0 MAINLY BECAUSE THE PRE-CHORUS LIKE I SAID IS GOING TO SET UP THE CHORUS WHERE OUR HOOK IS AND WHERE OUR HOPE IS AND WHERE OUR PUNCH LINE IS
HaMevfQiOu8_9 0 SO YOU WANT TO ADD A LITTLE ELEMENT OF HOPE
HaMevfQiOu8_10 0 SO I LIKE TO GO TO A MORE MAJOR KEY FOR THE PRE-CHORUS TO LEAD INTO IT
HaMevfQiOu8_11 0 HERE'S AN EXAMPLE
HaMevfQiOu8_12 0 [START SONG] I MIGHT NEVER MEET AN ANGEL
HaMevfQiOu8_13 0 I DON'T FEEL I HAVE TO TRY
HaMevfQiOu8_14 0 'CAUSE IN MY MIND SHE'S SIMPLY PERFECT AND I WILL ALWAYS BE WISHING I COULD SEE A DIFFERENT TEXAS SKY
HaMevfQiOu8_15 0 [END SONG] AND THERE'S A PRE-CHORUS AND WE'RE READY TO GO INTO OUR CHORUS
H4AiaAaPxds_1 0 TODAY MY ASSISTANT KENDRA AND I ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU THROUGH A FULL BODY WORKOUT EXPLAINING EACH MOVEMENT COMPLETE WITH PROPER TECHNIQUE FORM AND BREATHING
H4AiaAaPxds_2 0 SO LET'S BEGIN
H4AiaAaPxds_3 0 WHENEVER BEGINNING YOUR WORKOUT PROGRAM IT'S ALWAYS BEST TO DO A LITTLE WARM UP ACTIVITY BEFORE YOU BEGIN
H4AiaAaPxds_4 0 DO AT LEAST FIVE TO TEN MINUTES OF A LOW LEVEL AEROBIC ACTIVITY TO WARM UP WARM YOUR MUSCLES UP
H4AiaAaPxds_5 0 THERE ARE MANY VARIATIONS OF COURSE
H4AiaAaPxds_6 0 RIGHT HERE WE HAVE THE ELLIPTICAL
H4AiaAaPxds_7 0 WE HAVE RECUMBENT BICYCLES TREADMILL AND SO ON
H4AiaAaPxds_8 0 RIGHT NOW I HAVE KENDRA DOING ELLIPTICAL MACHINE AND OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY VARIATIONS
H4AiaAaPxds_9 0 SO KENDRA HOW MANY MINUTES HAVE YOU BEEN GOING ON THIS SO FAR
H4AiaAaPxds_10 0 WELL I'VE BEEN GOING FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AND THIS IS A VERY LOW IMPACT EXERCISE
H4AiaAaPxds_11 0 IT WORKS BOTH MY ARMS MY LEGS AND MY CORE AND IT GETS YOUR HEART RATE GOING AT THE SAME TIME
H3y6mHtRF3o_1 0 HI MELODY AGAIN TRYING TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF FOLDING ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
H3y6mHtRF3o_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO FOLD A PAIR OF MAN'S DRESS TROUSERS
H3y6mHtRF3o_4 0 FIRST THING I WOULD DO IS GO TO THE FRONT AND HOOK THEM OR ZIP THEM IF YOU WANT TO
H3y6mHtRF3o_5 0 RIGHT WHERE THE THESE HAVE BELT LOOPS SOME OF THE PANTS DON'T HAVE BELT LOOPS
H3y6mHtRF3o_6 0 WE'RE GOING TO FOLD THAT TOGETHER RIGHT ABOUT WHERE THE BELT LOOPS ARE THOUGH ON THIS PARTICULAR PAIR
H3y6mHtRF3o_7 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO LET THEM DROP DOWN
H3y6mHtRF3o_8 0 AND I'M HOLDING IT AT THAT SECTION
H3y6mHtRF3o_9 0 WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS WHERE IS THE PLEAT IN THE FRONT
H3y6mHtRF3o_10 0 USUALLY THERE'S A LITTLE POINT HERE THAT'S BEEN MADE ON YOUR TROUSERS
H3y6mHtRF3o_11 0 THERE WE GO
H3y6mHtRF3o_12 0 I'VE GOT THAT
H3y6mHtRF3o_13 0 IF YOU DON'T FIND ONE JUST TRY AND LINE UP THE SEAMS AND SEE IF YOU CAN GET THE SEAMS LINED UP
H3y6mHtRF3o_14 0 JUST SOME WAY TO HAVE A STRAIGHT ANGLE SO THAT THE PANTS HAVE AN EASY WAY TO JUST FOLD IN A NATURAL WAY RATHER THAN IN A DIFFICULT WAY
H3y6mHtRF3o_15 0 SO ANYWAY THAT'S WHAT I DO
H3y6mHtRF3o_16 0 I GRAB THAT AND I TRY AND FLATTEN IT OUT
H3y6mHtRF3o_17 0 SO YOU FIND YOUR CREASE AND FLATTEN THEM OUT
H3y6mHtRF3o_18 0 AND TYPICALLY IF THEY WERE GOING TO BE ON A HANGER THERE WOULD BE A MARKING APPROXIMATELY RIGHT THERE
H3y6mHtRF3o_19 0 I LIKE TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE LEVEL
H3y6mHtRF3o_20 0 IF YOU DID IT LEVEL ON A HANGER SOMETIMES THEY FALL OFF BECAUSE THE TOP'S TOO HEAVY
H3y6mHtRF3o_22 0 NOW BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON UP HERE YOU CAN FOLD IT INTO ITSELF THAT WAY BUT THEN WHAT YOU'VE GOT ON THE BACK SIDE ARE TWO LITTLE LEGS FLOPPING AROUND SO WHAT I DO IS PUT THE LEGS ON THE INSIDE
H3y6mHtRF3o_23 0 AND THERE YOU GO
H3y6mHtRF3o_24 0 NOW IF YOU'RE GOING SOMEWHERE AND THESE PANTS NEED TO BE WORN I WOULD SUGGEST TAKING THEM OUT OF THE BAG IF THEY WERE GOING TO BE IN A BAG OR IF YOU'RE GOING TO WEAR THEM
H3y6mHtRF3o_25 0 AND LET THEM STRAIGHT
H3y6mHtRF3o_26 0 LET THEM BE STRAIGHT FOR A WHILE EITHER LAYING OR HANGING SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE CREASES IN THEM
H3y6mHtRF3o_27 0 IN OUR NEXT SEGMENT I'LL BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO FOLD ANOTHER PIECE OF CLOTHING
glcPyqkeUug_1 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO PICK OUT A FRESH PINEAPPLE
glcPyqkeUug_2 0 A LOT OF MISCONCEPTIONS WITH THE PINEAPPLE
glcPyqkeUug_3 0 A LOT OF PEOPLE TOUCH IT ALL OVER THE PLACE SQUEEZE IT TALK TO IT WHATEVER LISTEN TO IT NOTHING LIKE THAT IS GOING TO TELL YOU IF IT'S RIPE
glcPyqkeUug_4 0 THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE WAY TO TELL IF IT'S RIPE AND THAT IS TO PULL ON THESE LEAVES ON THE TOP
glcPyqkeUug_5 0 NOT FROM THE OUTSIDE RIGHT HERE CAUSE THIS IS WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE MOST GREEN
glcPyqkeUug_6 0 YOU WANT TO GO FROM THE TOP RIGHT FROM THE TOP AND IF YOU JUST GIVE A NICE LITTLE TUG ON THEM LIKE THAT EVEN THE WEIGHT OF THE THING ITSELF SHOULD BE ABLE TO PULL THEM OUT LIKE THAT YOU KNOW RIGHT FROM THE TOP JUST LIKE THAT COME OUT REALLY EASY
glcPyqkeUug_7 0 THAT ONE IS RIPE
glcPyqkeUug_8 0 IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH LIKE THAT THAT'S NOT COMING OUT THAT ONE IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE QUITE AS RIPE
glcPyqkeUug_9 0 IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT MORE ROUGH IF YOU WERE TO CUT THIS OPEN
glcPyqkeUug_10 0 THE ONE'S THAT PULL OUT JUST LIKE THAT REALLY EASY ARE GOING TO BE THE RIPEST THAT YOU COULD FIND
glcPyqkeUug_11 0 IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY NICE AND SOFT NOT NOT TOO SOFT BUT IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT THE PERFECT PINEAPPLE JUST AS LONG AS THE TOPS COME OUT LIKE THAT REALLY EASY
glcPyqkeUug_12 0 BASICALLY THE ONLY THING YOU CAN LOOK FOR ON A PINEAPPLE BECAUSE THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A LOT OF BRUISING OR SCABS THAT YOU CAN SEE ANYWAY ON THEM BECAUSE THAT SKIN IS SO THICK YOU KNOW
glcPyqkeUug_13 0 SO THE ONLY WAY TO TELL IS TO PULL FROM THE TOP LIKE THAT AND THEY'RE COMING OFF SO THESE ONE'S ARE PRETTY RIPE
glcPyqkeUug_14 0 GOOD TO GO
glcPyqkeUug_15 0 THERE'S A FEW HERE THAT ARE NOT COMING OUT SO THAT ONE'S NOT GOOD TO GO

hada8QGkocg_4 0 SO IN MY NEXT CLIP HOW TO ELABORATE AND FINISH YOUR HENNA DESIGN
Gte8QwdOAcA_1 0 YOUR ALL PURPOSE BEATER IS GOING TO BE YOUR FLAT BEATER
Gte8QwdOAcA_2 0 THIS COULD BE USED FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN A SUPER LIGHT WHIP AND A SUPER HEAVY DOUGH
Gte8QwdOAcA_3 0 WHICH MEANS THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT FOR COOKIE DOUGHS FOR CAKE BATTERS FOR QUICK BREADS AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN
Gte8QwdOAcA_4 0 WITH THE STRUCTURE OF THIS IT'S GOING TO CUT THROUGH BUTTER TO CREAM YOUR BUTTER ADDING SUGAR FOR WHEN MAKING A NICE SWEET DISH
Gte8QwdOAcA_5 0 THIS WILL ALSO BE GOOD IF YOU'RE ADDING CHUNKIER BITS SAY TO A QUICK BREAD OR IF YOU'RE GOING TO ADD SOME NUTS TO IT
Gte8QwdOAcA_6 0 THEY'LL BE EASILY TO INCORPORATE THE FLAT BEATER YOU'LL SEE WITH THIS ONE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE IT AT AS A HIGH SPEED AS YOU WOULD WITH THE WHISK
Gte8QwdOAcA_7 0 BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO WHIP THINGS UP AND MAKE THEM NICE AND FLUFFY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE IT AT A SLOWER MORE MODERATE BEATING SPEED
Gte8QwdOAcA_8 0 DEPENDING ON WHAT EXACTLY YOU ARE MAKING YOU CAN HAVE IT FROM NICE AND SLOW SPEED UP TO A MUCH MORE FASTER SPEED
Gte8QwdOAcA_9 0 BUT YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO HAVE IT UP AS QUITE AS FAST AS IF YOU WERE USING THE WHISK
hhP4bEtborI_1 0 ALRIGHT NOW THAT WE GOT THIS WHERE WE WANT TO BE WE WANT TO START TAKE YOUR SPONGE START PULLING IT OUT TRYING TO KEEP IT AS EVEN BOTTOMED AS POSSIBLE
hhP4bEtborI_2 0 AND WHAT I MEAN THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO GOUGE YOUR HANDS INSIDE OF IT AND MAKE IT REAL CATTY WHOMPIS DOWN IN THERE YOU WANT TO HAVE IT NICE AND FLAT AS FLAT AS YOU CAN MAKE IT WITH YOUR FINGERS BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK AND FLATTEN IT OUT WITH THAT BLUE RIB OR A KIDNEY ALRIGHT
hhP4bEtborI_3 0 SO I'M GOING TO TAKE SOME MORE CLAY FROM THE MIDDLE HERE BECAUSE I REMEMBERED HOW THICK IT WAS AND I'M GOING TO START MOVING IT NOT SO MUCH THROWING REALLY IF MOVING CLAY FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER ALRIGHT
hhP4bEtborI_4 0 YOU SEE HOW THIS IS GOING STARTING TO GO LIKE THAT NO WAY YOU WANT TO BE IN CONTROL OF THE CLAY PUSH IT BACK TO WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
hhP4bEtborI_5 0 PINCH IT AND START PULLING IT OUT O.K TO THE DESIRED SIZE
hhP4bEtborI_6 0 ALRIGHT NOW YOU'LL SEE BY PINCHING IT YOU'VE CREATED A CAVERN DOWN THERE SO GO AHEAD AND TAKE THAT CLAY THAT YOU MOVED FROM THE CENTER AND PUT IT RIGHT THERE FILL IN THAT HOLE O.K
hhP4bEtborI_7 0 JUST LIKE THAT ALRIGHT
hhP4bEtborI_8 0 NOW IT'S TIME TO STRAIGHTEN THAT BAD BOY UP COME IN WITH A RUBBER RIB CLEAN IT ALL UP AND THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO ATTACH THESE PIECES
GZUw7MFvOwA_1 0 HI THIS IS BRUCE LESSELS FROM ZOAR OUTDOOR ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM TALKING ABOUT LOW IMPACT CAMPING METHODS
GZUw7MFvOwA_2 0 SO EVEN WHEN YOU MAKE A MAJOR EFFORT TO HAVE AS LOW IMPACT AS YOU CAN WHEN YOU'RE CAMPING YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE SOME IMPACT ON THE GROUND AND ON THE AREA WHERE YOU ARE AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OF WAYS TO RETURN IT TO MORE OR LESS ITS ORIGINAL STATE
GZUw7MFvOwA_3 0 OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE OUT EVERYTHING YOU BRING IN SO ANY FOOD WASTE ANY OF THOSE THINGS YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE OUT BUT YOU CAN STILL TELL THAT THIS AREA HAS BEEN WALKED ON AND CAMPED ON AND SOMEONE SPENT THE NIGHT HERE
GZUw7MFvOwA_4 0 SO ONE WAY TO START TO BRING THIS AREA BACK IS IF YOU BRUSHED AWAY SOME NETTLES AND LEAVES AND THINGS YOU CAN KIND OF BRUSH THOSE BACK INTO THE HOLLOWS
GZUw7MFvOwA_5 0 TRY TO RESTORE SOME OF THAT GROUND COVER BACK THE WAY IT WAS AND IF YOU MOVED LOGS IF YOU USED LOGS TO SIT ON AROUND THE CAMPFIRE IF YOU USED THEM TO SIT ON AS CAMP STOOLS TRY TO MOVE THOSE BACK TO WHERE YOU FOUND THEM OR PUT THEM BACK OUT IN THE WOODS SO THEY'RE NOT IN AN OBVIOUS PATTERN THAT YOU'VE CREATED
GZUw7MFvOwA_6 0 BASICALLY TRY TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS OF IT THE CAMPSITE LOOKS AND IS THE WAY AS MUCH THE WAY YOU FOUND AS POSSIBLE WHEN YOU'RE DONE
HCoR8_tnEd4_1 0 HI ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS I'M ASKED BY A PATIENT IS WHAT DO I DO NOW THAT I'VE MADE AN APPOINTMENT
HCoR8_tnEd4_2 0 SO YOU'VE FOUND THAT ACUPUNCTURIST THAT YOU WANT TO GO TO FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU GET A FEW THINGS TOGETHER AND YOU'RE PREPARED FOR THAT FIRST TREATMENT SO THAT YOU GET THE GREATEST BENEFIT AND SUCCESS FROM THAT TREATMENT
HCoR8_tnEd4_3 0 SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I ALWAYS RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE IS TO GATHER TOGETHER THEIR PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY ANY SUPPLEMENTS THEY ARE TAKING
HCoR8_tnEd4_4 0 IF YOU'RE ALREADY TAKING ANY HERBS OR VITAMINS MAKE SURE THAT YOU BRING THEM WITH YOU TO THE PRACTITIONER
HCoR8_tnEd4_5 0 BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'VE GOT A QUALITY CONTROL CHECK GOING ON AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKELY TO PRESCRIBE SOME SUPPLEMENTATION FOR YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO INTERFERE WITH ANY OF THE SUPPLEMENTS YOU'RE CURRENTLY TALKING
HCoR8_tnEd4_6 0 OFTEN TIMES YOU DO HAVE TO DISROBE DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF TREATMENT
HCoR8_tnEd4_7 0 SO IF YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT AT ALL MAKE SURE THAT YOU WEAR SOME VERY LOOSE CLOTHING THAT CAN BE MOVED SO THAT THEY CAN GET TO THE AREAS FOR ACUPUNCTURE
HCoR8_tnEd4_8 0 MANY ACUPUNCTURE TREATMENT FOCUS ON AREAS BELOW THE ELBOW AND BELOW THE KNEES
HCoR8_tnEd4_9 0 SO IF YOU'RE ABLE TO ROLL UP YOUR PANT LEG OR PUSH UP YOUR SLEEVES IT WILL BE MUCH EASIER FOR THE ACUPUNCTURIST TO GET TO THAT AREA
HCoR8_tnEd4_10 0 IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO AVOID ANY COLORED LIQUIDS A FEW HOURS BEFORE YOUR TREATMENT
HCoR8_tnEd4_11 0 YOUR PRACTITIONER WILL BE LOOKING AT YOUR TONGUE TO SEE WHETHER THERE'S ANY CHANGES IN THAT
HCoR8_tnEd4_12 0 SO IF YOU'VE HAD COFFEE OR TEA BEFORE YOUR TREATMENT YOU MIGHT FOOL THEM BY HAVING A YELLOW OR COATING ON YOUR TONGUE
HCoR8_tnEd4_13 0 IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO EAT SOME FOOD BEFORE YOU GO BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE HUNGRY AND ANXIOUS BEFORE YOU GO
HCoR8_tnEd4_14 0 SO MAKE SURE THAT YOU EAT A NORMAL MEAL SOMETHING THAT'S NOT TOO FULL AND NOT RIGHT BEFORE YOU WALK IN
HCoR8_tnEd4_15 0 SO THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO ENJOY YOUR TREATMENT AND GET THE MOST BENEFIT OUT OF IT
HCoR8_tnEd4_16 0 MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO RELAX AND HAVE A GOOD TIME AND PROVIDE THE PRACTITIONER WITH LOTS OF DETAILS AND INFORMATION SO THEY CAN GIVE YOU THE FASTEST AND BEST PROGRESS THAT CAN BE HAD FROM THE TREATMENTS

gZX4nwXrPKM_1 0 THE FIRST HOUSE IN PRESERVATION PARK IS THE REMILLARD HOUSE
gZX4nwXrPKM_2 0 IT'S A QUEEN ANNE STYLE HOUSE BUILT IN 1887
gZX4nwXrPKM_3 0 FOR THE REMILLARD FAMILY THEY WERE FRENCH CANADIANS AND MR REMILLARD OPERATED A BRICK WORKS COMPANY AND MANY OF THE BRICK BUILDINGS IN NINETEEN CENTURY OAKLAND WERE BUILT BY THE REMILLARD BRICK COMPANY
gZX4nwXrPKM_4 0 BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THEIR OWN HOME THEY WENT WITH A WOOD FRAME VICTORIAN STYLE HOUSE AND IT IS THE FIRST HOUSE IN PRESERVATION PARK
gZX4nwXrPKM_5 0 THE FREDRICK GINN HOUSE IS HOUSE NUMBER TWO IN PRESERVATION PARK
gZX4nwXrPKM_6 0 THE GINNS HAD A PUBLISHING COMPANY AND PUBLISHED SCHOOL TEXT BOOKS
gZX4nwXrPKM_7 0 LATER THE GINN HOUSE WAS THE HOME OF A SOCIAL CLUB FOR MEN IN NINETEEN CENTURY OAKLAND AND KNOWN AS THE NILE CLUB AND THEY HAD MANY PARTIES AND MUSICALS AND MEETINGS OVER THE YEARS IN THE HISTORIC GINN HOUSE
gZX4nwXrPKM_8 0 THE GINN HOUSE IS NOT VICTORIAN
gZX4nwXrPKM_9 0 IT'S MORE ARTS AND CRAFTS AND SO IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE WONDERFUL ARCHITECTURE HERE IN PRESERVATION PARK
gb8IQZH_7EM_2 0 HOW'S IT GOING
gb8IQZH_7EM_3 0 MY NAME IS KEVIN BARRET AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M HERE TO TEACH YOU HOW TO PLAY THE GAME OF BEER PONG
gb8IQZH_7EM_4 0 BEER PONG IS GREAT GAME BECAUSE IT'S A GAME THAT YOU NEITHER WIN NOR LOSE BECAUSE IF YOU'RE LOSING YOU GET TO DRINK BEER AND IF YOU'RE WINNING YOU'RE WINNING AND YOU GET TO DRINK BEER
gb8IQZH_7EM_5 0 BEER PONG IS GREAT GAME
gb8IQZH_7EM_6 0 I LEARNED IT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN LET'S SAY I WAS 21 AND I LEARNED HOW TO PLAY BEER PONG
gb8IQZH_7EM_7 0 IT'S A VERY COMPETITIVE GAME
gb8IQZH_7EM_8 0 IT WAS ACTUALLY DERIVED FROM COLLEGE
gb8IQZH_7EM_9 0 I THINK IT WAS BACK EAST THESE KIDS DECIDED TO START THROWING A BALL INTO A CUP
gb8IQZH_7EM_10 0 IT EARLIER WAS PLAYED WITH PING-PONG PADDLES LIKE A TABLE TENNIS GAME AND THAT TURNED IN TO WHERE YOU JUST THROW THE BALL INTO THE CUP WHICH MADE IT A LOT EASIER AND YOU DRUNK A LOT QUICKER HONESTLY
gb8IQZH_7EM_11 0 IT'S ACTUALLY FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY
gb8IQZH_7EM_12 0 IT'S PRETTY RIDICULOUS
gb8IQZH_7EM_13 0 MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY LIKE TO PLAY
gb8IQZH_7EM_14 0 MY LITTLE SISTER ACTUALLY PLAYS AND SHE CALLS IT GATOR PONG WHERE SHE AND MY LITTLE COUSINS PLAY WITH GATORADE AND WE PLAY WITH THE WONDERFUL BEER
-HblvPZ_n00_1 0 HI I'M SUE ROSE WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MANY USES OF YOUR LIGHT BOX
-HblvPZ_n00_2 0 I HAVE USED MINE TO CALL AND DETERMINE THE SLIDES THAT I WANT TO USE FOR JURIED SHOWS
-HblvPZ_n00_3 0 I HAVE CHECKED THE THREE DIFFERENT SLIDES AND PUT AND X ON THE ONE THAT I THINK IS THE BETTER QUALITY
-HblvPZ_n00_4 0 I HAVE USED IT FOR THAT
-HblvPZ_n00_5 0 I HAVE ALSO USED IT TO TRANSFER MY ORIGINAL POSTER DRAWING TO A REGULAR PIECE OF WATERCOLOR PAPER
-HblvPZ_n00_6 0 AND I HAVE ALSO USED IT TO TAKE SOME PHOTOGRAPHS THAT I TOOK MYSELF TO TRANSFER THEM TO A PIECE OF PAPER AND THEN TO TAKE ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPH AND TO ADD THE LEAVES IN A DIFFERENT WAY SO THAT THIS WAY I'M TAKING TWO PHOTOGRAPHS ONE FLOWER BUT I NOW HAVE THREE FLOWERS ON MY PIECE OF PAPER AND LEAVES FROM ANOTHER PIECE OF PAPER
-HblvPZ_n00_7 0 AND SO I'M BEGINNING TO MAKE AN OVERALL COMPOSITION WITH AN OVERALL PATTERN TO IT
-HblvPZ_n00_8 0 STAY TUNED FOR SOME OTHER VIDEOS THAT WE HAVE ON DOING YOUR ART AND SOME HELPFUL TIPS I HAVE ON DOING WATERCOLOR
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_1 0 HI I'M AARON GREGORY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_2 0 I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR CAR BATTERY DIES HOW TO SELECT A NEW BATTERY AND HOW TO SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_3 0 WE'LL BEGIN BY REMOVING THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL FROM THE BATTERY AND GETTING IT OUT OF THE WAY SO THAT IT DOES NOT STAY TOUCHING AND CONTACTED
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_4 0 AND THEN WE'LL REMOVE THE POSITIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_5 0 OH WOW THAT ONE WAS TOO LOOSE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_6 0 THIS TERMINAL MIGHT STAY CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IF YOU DON'T BEND IT OUT OF THE WAY A LITTLE IN WHICH CASE WE MIGHT STILL HAVE THE SPARKING PROBLEM
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_7 0 SO AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S THOROUGHLY OUT OF THE WAY
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_8 0 AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO THIS ONE LOOSENING AND SOMETIMES THIS TERMINAL WILL BE STUCK REALLY TIGHT
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_9 0 NOW THEY MAKE A TOOL CALLED THE BATTERY TERMINAL PULLER THAT HAS A THREADED ROD AND A LITTLE PLUNGER AND YOU SCREW IT DOWN AND IT LIFTS THE THING UP
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_10 0 WITHOUT HAVING THIS SPECIAL TOOL THERE'S A SLOT HERE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_11 0 AND IF YOU OPEN THE THREADED ROD AND USE A TOOL TO SPREAD THESE THESE EARS THAT GET PINCHED TOGETHER AND THEN YOU LIFT THE FRONT OF THE TERMINAL GENTLY
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_12 0 YOU CAN USUALLY GET IT OFF
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_13 0 WHEN YOU'RE REMOVING TERMINALS BOTH SIDES LOOK LIKE A BOLT
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_14 0 BUT YOU WANT TO TURN THE NUT SIDE AND LOOSEN THE NUT SIDE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_15 0 BECAUSE THE SQUARE BOLT HEAD IS NOT SUPPOSED TO ROTATE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_16 0 IT STAYS STATIONARY
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_17 0 LOOSEN IT A LITTLE MORE THAN YOU THINK YOU NEED TO BUT DON'T TAKE THE NUT ALL THE WAY OFF
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_18 0 THAT WAY YOU HAVE SOME CLEARANCE TO SPREAD THE LEAD OPEN TO GET THE TERMINAL OFF THE BATTERY
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_19 0 TRY TO TWIST IT
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_20 0 IF IT WON'T TWIST YOU MIGHT NEED TO OPEN THIS GAP HERE SLIGHTLY WITH YOUR WRENCH OR A SCREWDRIVER
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_21 0 OPEN THE RING AND MAKE IT LARGER
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_22 0 AND THEN TWIST IT
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_24 0 IF NECESSARY PRY A LITTLE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_25 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO PRY THE TERMINAL UP LIFT EVENLY SO THAT YOU DON'T BREAK THE LEAD TERMINAL OFF OF THE BATTERY
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_26 0 NOW THAT THE TERMINALS ARE OFF THE BATTERY WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANY SIGNS OF WHITE POWDERY CORROSION OR BROWN RUST
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_27 0 AND THE SAME GOES FOR THE INSIDE LOOP OF THE CAR END OF THE TERMINAL THE FEMALE SIDE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_28 0 TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE THAT HAVE A WIRE BRUSH THAT STICKS IN AND YOU ROTATE TO CLEAN THE FEMALE SIDE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_29 0 AND THEN THERE'S ALSO A MATING FEMALE BRUSH THAT GOES OVER THE TERMINAL THAT YOU CAN TWIST
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_30 0 SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_31 0 I LIKE TO USE A WIRE BRUSH AND SCRUB THE TERMINALS UNTIL I SEE SHINY CLEAN LEAD
G78nL9acDGo_1 0 ONE INDISPENSABLE FEATURE THAT YOU NEED WHEN YOU WRITE A CROSSWORD PUZZLE IS YOU NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE THE ANSWERS
G78nL9acDGo_2 0 NOW THERE ARE TWO MAIN WAYS OF DOING THAT
G78nL9acDGo_3 0 ONE IS TO USE THE GRID FILLED IN AS IT APPEARED USUALLY IN A SMALLER VERSION
G78nL9acDGo_4 0 IN ONE PUBLICATION I DO THEM FOR I ACTUALLY DO THEM IN THE SAME PUBLICATION ON THE SAME PAGE
G78nL9acDGo_5 0 BUT FLIP THE GRID UPSIDE DOWN WITH THE SOLUTION IN IT
G78nL9acDGo_6 0 ANOTHER WAY IS JUST TO LIST THE WORDS WITH THE NUMBER OF THE CLUE
G78nL9acDGo_7 0 OR THE EXPANDING ON THAT FOR A CRYPTIC CROSSWORD USE SOME SORT OF SHORTHAND INFORMATION TO INDICATE THE TYPE OF CLUE OR HOW IT IS CONSTRUCTED
G78nL9acDGo_8 0 FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I DO IT I USE BRACES TO INDICATE A NANOGRAM
G78nL9acDGo_9 0 A HYPHEN TO INDICATE PARTS OF A WORD IN A CHARADE OF CLUES
G78nL9acDGo_10 0 PARENTHESIS TO INDICATE ONE WORD INSIDE ANOTHER
gBX_yK0IkWY_1 0 I'M GOING TO BEGIN TO TREAT MATT'S EARS
gBX_yK0IkWY_2 0 WE HAVE A STERILE PROBE ON THE END OF THIS NEEDLE HOLDER AND THEN I KNOW WHERE THE PROBLEM IS AND I'VE GOT TO TILT HIS EAR THE WAY I HAVE TO GO
gBX_yK0IkWY_3 0 THESE ARE KIND OF TRANSLUCENT HAIRS BUT THEY'RE LONG WISPY HAIRS BUT I CAN IMAGINE IN THE SUNLIGHT THAT MATT DOESN'T LIKE WHAT THESE LOOK LIKE
gBX_yK0IkWY_4 0 SO I'M GOING TO TAKE AND I'M GOING TO PINCH THE EAR A LITTLE BIT SO THAT IT DOESN'T HURT MATT SO MUCH BECAUSE EARS CAN BE SENSITIVE AND MOST MEN THAT I'VE TREATED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS DO NOT HAVE A GREAT PAIN TOLERANCE
gBX_yK0IkWY_5 0 SO THEN I REMOVE THAT HAIR THEN I'M OFF TO THE NEXT ONE PINCHING THE EAR AND THEN I'LL ASK MATT HOW YOU DOING MATT
gBX_yK0IkWY_6 0 I'M DOING GOOD
gBX_yK0IkWY_7 0 OK IS IT TERRIBLE
gBX_yK0IkWY_10 0 SEE NOW THAT'S THE WAY YOU WANT TO WORK
gBX_yK0IkWY_11 0 YOU WANT TO WORK WITH A CLIENT THAT'S NOT COMPLAINING NOT HURTING
gBX_yK0IkWY_12 0 IF THEY I TELL THEM IF YOU'RE HURTING LET ME KNOW BECAUSE I CAN DO THINGS ABOUT IT TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR YOU
gBX_yK0IkWY_13 0 SO THERE WE GO I PINCH THAT EAR I GOT I TREAT IT I'M GOING TO KEEP TREATING AND WITH MATT LESS THAN TEN MINUTES I'LL HAVE HIS HAIR PROBLEM FINISHED
gBX_yK0IkWY_14 0 IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A BIG PROBLEM FOR MATT AND THEN AFTERWARDS WITH EARS I LIKE TO TAKE ICE AND COOL THE EAR DOWN AND THEN IT'S LIKE NO BIG DEAL FOR THE CLIENT
gBX_yK0IkWY_15 0 THERE YOU GO
gBX_yK0IkWY_16 0 AND HE HAS A FEW HERE TOO THAT I'LL TREAT BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT'S GOOD THAT HE'S COMING IN EARLY AND NOT WAITING FOR THIS TO BECOME A BIGGER PROBLEM
gBX_yK0IkWY_17 0 IT KIND OF KILLS THE PROBLEM BEFORE IT TAKES OFF
GCYXreUMM7g_1 0 OK WE ARE MAKING TEDDY BEAR CHOCOLATE POPSICLES
GCYXreUMM7g_2 0 ALRIGHT COME ON DOWN HERE I SHOWED YOU MY POPSICLES ALREADY HAND MADE BY MY SCISSOR AND MYSELF
GCYXreUMM7g_3 0 AND SO BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE THE LENGTH OF THIS IF YOU BRING IT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH STICK TO ATTACH ITSELF TO THE TEDDY BEAR IT'LL FALL RIGHT OFF
GCYXreUMM7g_4 0 AND SO YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GET SOME GOOD SPACE IN THERE AND RIGHT HERE I'VE GOT SOME GOOD SPACE AND THEN ONCE AGAIN RIGHT HERE
GCYXreUMM7g_5 0 I HAVE SOME EXTRA MOLDS THAT ARE ARE REALLY FUN TO DO
GCYXreUMM7g_6 0 THESE THESE LITTLE CHOCOLATE I'M SORRY THESE LITTLE HEARTS AS YOU CAN SEE DOWN HERE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TO THOSE IS WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE COLOR A LITTLE BIT AND WE'RE GOING TO FILL THESE LITTLE HEARTS HERE WITH A DIFFERENT COLOR
GCYXreUMM7g_7 0 BECAUSE AS YOU CAN SEE THE TEDDY BEAR DOWN HERE HE HAS A KIND OF AN IMPRINT IN HIS IN HIS MOLD SO THAT YOU CAN STICK THESE LITTLE THESE LITTLE CHOCOLATE HEARTS THAT ARE HOPEFULLY A DIFFERENT COLOR SO THEY STAND OUT AND THEY LOOK REALLY REALLY CUTE
GCYXreUMM7g_8 0 AND SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING WE'RE GOING TO FILL THESE LITTLE TEDDY BEARS AS IS
GCYXreUMM7g_9 0 UH OH I THINK I MAY NEED TO ADD SOME MORE BUT GO AHEAD AND FILL OH EXCUSE YOU
GCYXreUMM7g_10 0 ALRIGHT YUP LOOKS LIKE I'M RUNNING OUT OF CHOCOLATE SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE FEW MORE CHOCOLATE WAFERS TO THIS TO GET REALLY WHAT I'M LOOKING TO DO HERE
GCYXreUMM7g_11 0 SO I'M GOING TO DO THAT AND I'LL HAVE MY CHOCOLATE READY WHEN YOU GUYS COME BACK
_hg5i_FMbeY_1 0 IN THIS SECTION WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS SOME METHODS YOU CAN USE IN DEALING WITH TOUGH CUSTOMERS
_hg5i_FMbeY_2 0 I'M PAMELA UNRUH ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
_hg5i_FMbeY_3 0 NOW AS WE TALK ABOUT TOUGH CUSTOMERS AND DEALING WITH TOUGH CUSTOMERS IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER DOCUMENT EVERYTHING
_hg5i_FMbeY_4 0 JUST AS IT'S IMPORTANT TO PUT NOTES IN A CUSTOMER'S FILE EVERY TIME YOU SERVICE A SYSTEM OR HELP FIX SOMETHING WITH A CUSTOMER IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO DOCUMENT WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING UNPLEASANT LIKE THIS HAPPEN THE PHYSICAL ABUSE OR THE VERBAL ABUSE OR THE PROFANITY BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HAVE THAT TO BACK YOU UP AND TO PROTECT YOURSELF
_hg5i_FMbeY_5 0 NOW I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT THE CUSTOMER THAT BEAT UP OUR SERVICEMAN AT THE FRONT DOOR IT WASN'T TWO MUCH LATER THAT WE WERE CONTACTED BY AN ATTORNEY THAT THIS GENTLEMAN HAD HIRED AND HE WAS BASICALLY SUING US BECAUSE WE REFUSED TO SERVICE HIS EQUIPMENT
_hg5i_FMbeY_6 0 ALL OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT HAPPENED THAT DAY WERE VERY CAREFULLY DOCUMENTED THEY WERE CHECKED FOR ACCURACY THEY WERE PUT IN HIS FILE AND NOT ONLY THAT THEY WERE ALSO EMAILED TO OTHER SOURCES WHO HAD A NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS TYPE OF THING
_hg5i_FMbeY_7 0 SO I HAD A VERY GOOD PAPER TRAIL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED I HAD STATEMENTS FROM THE SERVICEMAN AND I ALSO HAD DATES AND TIMES STAMPED ON THE EMAILS
_hg5i_FMbeY_8 0 SO THESE WERE IN TERM PROVIDED TO THE ATTORNEY WHO WAS VERY EMBARRASSED TO HAVE GOTTEN INVOLVED IN SUCH A SITUATION AND OF COURSE CONTRIVED BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW THE WHOLE STORY AND THAT JUST ESSENTIALLY GOT FUSED THE WHOLE SITUATION
_hg5i_FMbeY_9 0 WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT ANYMORE BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO DOCUMENT THESE TYPES OF THINGS SO THAT THE NEXT PERSON TO DEAL WITH A CUSTOMER KNOWS WHAT TYPE OF CUSTOMER THEY'RE DEALING WITH
_hg5i_FMbeY_10 0 THAT MAYBE PUTS YOUR DEFENSES UP A LITTLE BIT AND YOU SHOULDN'T PROBABLY DO THAT WITH MANY CUSTOMERS BUT WHEN YOU HAVE CUSTOMERS WHO CROSS THIS KIND OF LINE YOU NEED TO BE AWARE IT'S FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY
GEVpAiTeQLI_1 0 NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO CUT OUT OUR IMAGE
GEVpAiTeQLI_2 0 WHAT WE DO IS WE ONLY NEED TO GO AROUND THE OUTER LINES OF THE IMAGE
GEVpAiTeQLI_3 0 ANYTHING THAT'S ANY DETAILS THAT ARE ON THE IMAGE ARE NOT GOING TO BE SEEN
GEVpAiTeQLI_4 0 SO VERY CAREFULLY CUT AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE IMAGE
GEVpAiTeQLI_5 0 NOW THE IMAGE DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF YOUR SCREEN IT SHOULD ALL BE RELATIVE
GEVpAiTeQLI_6 0 BUT IT SHOULD DEFINITELY BE BIG ENOUGH THAT IT CAN BE SEEN FROM A DISTANCE
GEVpAiTeQLI_7 0 DEPENDING ON HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN YOUR AUDIENCE
GEVpAiTeQLI_8 0 HOW MANY KIDS YOU'LL BE SHOWING THIS TO
GEVpAiTeQLI_9 0 SO KEEP IN MIND KEEP IT ALL RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF THE SCREEN
GEVpAiTeQLI_10 0 OUR IMAGE IS ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE INCHES LONG FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
GEVpAiTeQLI_11 0 AND OUR SCREEN IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIGGER THAN A REGULAR PIECE OF NOTEBOOK PAPER OR COPY PAPER
GEVpAiTeQLI_12 0 NOT ONLY IS IT IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THE SIZE OF THE IMAGE THAT YOU'RE CREATING BUT ALSO WHEN YOU'RE CREATING MORE THAN ONE IMAGE WHICH YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE AN ENTERTAINING SHOW
GEVpAiTeQLI_13 0 YOU JUST MAKE THEM ALL KEEP THEM ALL SOMEWHAT OF AN EQUAL SIZE
GEVpAiTeQLI_14 0 SO THAT THEY'RE ALL IN PROPORTION
GEVpAiTeQLI_15 0 SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE MAKING YOUR IMAGES
GEVpAiTeQLI_16 0 JUST KEEP IN MIND WHICH IMAGES YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING AND THE SIZES OF EACH IMAGE WHICH YOU'VE CREATED
GEVpAiTeQLI_17 0 WHEN YOU DO THE PROJECT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY BE CREATING SEVERAL IMAGES BECAUSE IT JUST MAKES THE WHOLE THING MORE FUN
GEVpAiTeQLI_18 0 AND YOU'RE ABLE TO CHANGE ABLE TO GO BACK AND FORTH BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE SILHOUETTE EFFECT
GEVpAiTeQLI_19 0 THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SEE YOUR HANDS THEY ONLY SEE THE IMAGE WHEN IT COMES CLOSE TO THE SCREEN
GEVpAiTeQLI_20 0 SO IT'S DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED TO MAKE SEVERAL IMAGES TO REALLY MAKE A NICE SHOW OUT OF IT
GEVpAiTeQLI_21 0 DON'T THINK THAT YOU SINCE YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO BE USING YOUR TWO HANDS THAT YOU HAVE TO LIMIT IT TO TWO IMAGES
GEVpAiTeQLI_22 0 JUST BE CAREFUL GOING AROUND ON THE EDGES OF THE IMAGE
GEVpAiTeQLI_23 0 IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE VERY SHARP POINTS MAKE THE OUTER AREA AS SHARP AS YOU CAN
GEVpAiTeQLI_24 0 BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO HELP THE SHADOW SHOW THROUGH ANY INDENTATIONS TO HIGHLIGHT A NOSE OR A MOUTH
GEVpAiTeQLI_25 0 YOU SHOULD REALLY TRY TO MAKE A SEPARATE CUT FOR EACH OF THOSE
GEVpAiTeQLI_26 0 AND THAT'LL HELP THE IMAGE SHOW MUCH MORE CLEAR
GEVpAiTeQLI_27 0 SO THIS IS HOW WE CUT OUT THE IMAGE THAT WE'VE DRAWN
GEVpAiTeQLI_28 0 AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO ATTACH TO A STICK AND FINISH THE PUPPET
HE5tiPfCQIo_1 0 I'M DOING A DEMONSTRATION FOR EXPERT VILLAGE PAINTING 101
HE5tiPfCQIo_2 0 THE FIRST STEP AND MOST IMPORTANT STEP IN PAINTING IS THE PREPARATION
HE5tiPfCQIo_3 0 HERE WHAT WE ARE DOING IS TAPING OFF THE MOLDING WHERE YOU DON'T WANT TO PAINT
HE5tiPfCQIo_4 0 WHAT THEY DO WHEN THEY ARE PAINTING WITH THE ROLLER IS THE TEMPTATION TO GO AND PAINT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TAPE LINE WHEN YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THE MORE PAINT YOU PUT ON THE TAPE YOU CREATE A SEAL SO THAT WHEN YOU PULL THE TAPE BACK YOU WIND UP PULLING THE PAINT AND MESSING UP A LOT OF GOOD WORK
HE5tiPfCQIo_5 0 SO YOU REALLY WANT TO PAINT TO ABOUT AN 1/4 OF INCH AWAY FROM YOUR TAPE LINE AND THEN FINISH THAT PART WITH THE BRUSH
HE5tiPfCQIo_6 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO USE SMOOTH EASY STROKES AND BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVER PAINT YOUR PREPARATION LINE
GS8ijsnoJjA_1 0 HI THE DRINK THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE IS CALLED BITTERSWEET WITH A TWIST
GS8ijsnoJjA_2 0 LET'S PUT OUR ICE IN A GLASS HERE
GS8ijsnoJjA_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ONE SHOT OF TEQUILA AND ANY TEQUILA WILL WORK
GS8ijsnoJjA_4 0 I FIND THAT WHENEVER YOU'RE MIXING A TEQUILA WITH A JUICE IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT KIND YOU USE BECAUSE THE JUICE IS GOING TO OVERPOWER MOST OF THE TASTE OF THE TEQUILA ANYWAYS
GS8ijsnoJjA_5 0 SO ONE SHOT OF TEQUILA AND WE'RE GOING TO FILL UP THE REST OF THE WAY WITH GRAPEFRUIT JUICE THERE WE GO VERY NICE AND LET'S MIX THIS UP REAL GOOD
GS8ijsnoJjA_6 0 WE SHOULD HAVE A BITTERSWEET TASTE TO THIS WITH THE GRAPEFRUIT JUICE BUT THE TEQUILA'S GOING TO HAVE A NICE BIT OF CONTROL OVER THE BITTERNESS OF THAT GRAPEFRUIT JUICE
GS8ijsnoJjA_7 0 SET UP OUR GLASS AND POUR IT IN GIVE IT A STRAW AND GARNISH IT WITH A LEMON
GS8ijsnoJjA_8 0 THERE WE GO BOTTOMS UP
h8dHMToYurY_1 0 HI I'M ACHARYA VIKRAMADITYA ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
h8dHMToYurY_2 0 TODAY I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SECOND MUDRA OF THE GYAN MUDRA SERIES
h8dHMToYurY_3 0 LAST TIME I TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS PURNA GYAN MUDRA AND WHEN BOTH THE HANDS COME ON THE KNEES TWO KNEES THIS BECOMES VAIRAGYA MUDRA
h8dHMToYurY_4 0 THIS IS THE SECOND IMPORTANT MUDRA OF THE GYAN MUDRA SERIES
h8dHMToYurY_5 0 ONCE YOU ACQUIRE THE WISDOM THEN ONLY YOU CAN HAVE A STAGE OF DETACHMENT
h8dHMToYurY_6 0 VAIRAGYA MEANS DETACHMENT
h8dHMToYurY_7 0 IF YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE SADHANA THE HIGHEST STAGE OF SADHANA MEDITATION
h8dHMToYurY_8 0 THIS MUDRA IS VERY ESSENTIAL FOR THAT
h8dHMToYurY_9 0 YOU HAVE SEEN A LOT THERE IN THE MAHATMA DHYAN THEN SARASWATI
h8dHMToYurY_10 0 MOST OF THE TIME HE USED TO REMAIN IN THIS MUDRA
h8dHMToYurY_11 0 AND IF YOU ARE BORN TO PRACTICE ENHANCE THE SPIRITUAL ENHANCEMENT YOU HAVE TO DEFEAT YOURSELF FROM THE WORLDLY EXPERIENCES
h8dHMToYurY_12 0 YOU HAVE TO DETACH YOURSELF
h8dHMToYurY_13 0 THIS MUDRA YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE THIS MUDRA
h8dHMToYurY_14 0 SO PRACTICE THIS MUDRA AND FEEL THE DETACHMENT
gyuT7GyYraA_1 0 MY NAME IS CHRISTINE MARQUETTE AND I'M A REGISTERED DIETITIAN WITH THE AUSTIN REGIONAL CLINIC AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO BUY PHTHALATE-FREE PRODUCTS
gyuT7GyYraA_2 0 PHTHALATES ARE A CHEMICAL THAT ARE TYPICALLY FOUND IN PLASTICS THEY CAN BE USED TO INCREASE THEIR FLEXIBILITY
gyuT7GyYraA_3 0 BUT THEY'RE ALSO FOUND IN A VARIETY OF OTHER PRODUCTS
gyuT7GyYraA_4 0 PERSONAL CARE ITEMS FOR EXAMPLE THEY CAN FOUND IN NAIL POLISH DEODORANT HAIR SPRAY PERFUMES VARIOUS TYPES OF PAINTS
gyuT7GyYraA_5 0 THEY'RE ALSO FOUND IN PESTICIDES AND IN PLASTICS THINGS LIKE PVC PIPES PVC THAT'S ALSO USED IN FLOORING AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS
gyuT7GyYraA_6 0 THE REASON WHY THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASED INTEREST IN FINDING PRODUCTS THAT DON'T HAVE PHTHALATES IS BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN SOME RESEARCH SHOWING THAT THERE IS AN INCREASED RISK OF BIRTH DEFECTS LIVER CANCER KIDNEY PROBLEMS AND OTHER HORMONAL IMBALANCES IN LABORATORY ANIMALS
gyuT7GyYraA_7 0 SO FOR THIS REASON A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED WITH THEIR EXPOSURE TO PHTHALATES
gyuT7GyYraA_8 0 ANOTHER CAUSE OF CONCERN IS THAT THE CDC DID A RANDOM SAMPLE OF ADULT WOMEN OF CHILD BEARING AGE AND FOUND THAT A LOT OF THEM HAD I THINK IT WAS OVER SEVENTY PERCENT HAD MORE THAN THE RECOMMENDED LEVEL OF PHTHALATES CIRCULATING IN THEIR BLOODSTREAM
gyuT7GyYraA_9 0 BECAUSE THIS PARTICULAR CHEMICAL IS QUITE UBIQUITOUS ITS FOUND EVERYWHERE
gyuT7GyYraA_10 0 SO ONE OF THE WAYS THAT YOU CAN GO ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT YOUR PRODUCTS ARE PHTHALATE-FREE IS SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT THE INGREDIENTS FOR THAT PARTICULAR WORD
gyuT7GyYraA_11 0 THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT ESTERS IT MAY BE A MULTI-SYLLABLE WORD BUT ALWAYS LOOK FOR PHTHALATE AS THE ENDING
gyuT7GyYraA_12 0 THERE MAY ALSO BE SOME THAT ARE JUST USING STRAIGHT ABBREVIATIONS
gyuT7GyYraA_13 0 THE ABBREVIATIONS TO LOOK FOR WOULD BE DEHP
gyuT7GyYraA_14 0 THAT STANDS FOR DI2-ETHYLHEXYL PHTHALATE
gyuT7GyYraA_15 0 ANOTHER ABBREVIATION IS DIDP
gyuT7GyYraA_16 0 THAT STANDS FOR DI-ISODECYL PHTHALATE
gyuT7GyYraA_17 0 AND THEN DINP
gyuT7GyYraA_18 0 THAT STANDS FOR DI-ISONONYL PHTHALATE
gyuT7GyYraA_19 0 SO IF YOU SEE ANY OF THOSE ABBREVIATIONS YOU KNOW THAT THAT PARTICULAR PRODUCT STILL HAS PHTHALATES IN IT
gyuT7GyYraA_20 0 MANY MANUFACTURERS WHO MAKE NAIL POLISH AND HAIR SPRAY AND THOSE KIND OF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS ARE VERY HAPPY TO ADVERTISE THAT THEY HAVE PRODUCTS THAT ARE
g50rCJZrX0k_1 0 JOHN VANDEBROOKE MY NAME IS JOHN VANDEBROOKE AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I WANT YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT BEGINNING ENCAUSTIC PAINTING
g50rCJZrX0k_2 0 THE HOT TOOLS THAT I MENTIONED THAT YOU NEED TO USE THIS EUROPEAN STYLE METHOD OF ENCAUSTIC PAINTING WOULD START WITH THE MAIN TOOL WOULD BE AN IRON LIKE THIS TRAVEL IRON SIZE
g50rCJZrX0k_3 0 IT IS DESIGNED FOR ENCAUSTIC PAINTING
g50rCJZrX0k_4 0 YOU COULD TRY TO FIND A SMALL IRON AT HOME TO TRY THIS BUT YOU WOULDN'T WANT A STEAM IRON THAT HAS HOLES IN THE SURFACE AND YOU WOULDN'T WANT A TEFLON COATED IRON
g50rCJZrX0k_5 0 AND THE OTHER TOOL WOULD BE A STYLUS WHICH HAS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT POINTS THAT CAN BE PUT IN THE FRONT ALL OPERATING AT A LOW TEMPERATURE AROUND 200 DEGREES
g50rCJZrX0k_6 0 SO DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS LIKE A WOOD BURNING TOOL THAT WOULD BE MUCH TOO HOT TO WORK WITH WITH WAX AND ACTUALLY COULD CAUSE THE WAX TO CATCH ON FIRE
g50rCJZrX0k_7 0 THE THING ABOUT THIS TRAVEL IRON IS THAT IT CAN BE REASSEMBLED INTO A HOT PLATE SO YOU CAN WORK WITH HOT PAPER INSTEAD OF USING IT AS AN IRON
g50rCJZrX0k_8 0 AND THEN ANOTHER THING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO LOOK AT IS THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF WAXES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE
g50rCJZrX0k_9 0 THESE PARTICULAR WAXES COME IN THREE DIFFERENT SETS OF COLORS AND ALL OF THESE COMES FROM THE NETHERLANDS
g50rCJZrX0k_10 0 AND IF YOU'LL NOTICE THESE ARE QUITE SMALL SIZES OF THESE BLOCKS
g50rCJZrX0k_11 0 A TRADITIONAL ENCAUSTIC PAINTER NEEDS HUGE BLOCKS OF WAX PUT IN POTS AND MELT AND THEREFORE IT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THIS PROCESS
g50rCJZrX0k_12 0 WHEN YOU GET ALL THROUGH PAINTING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO PROTECT YOUR PAINTING WITH A SEALER OF SOME KIND AND THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY KINDS OF SEALERS YOU COULD USE
g50rCJZrX0k_13 0 ANOTHER TOOL THAT I USE IS A HOT AIR GUN TO BLOW THE WAX AROUND
g50rCJZrX0k_14 0 NOW THIS IS A REAL COMMERCIAL MODEL THAT I GOT FROM SEARS BUT I LIKE IT BECAUSE I CAN DIAL THE TEMPERATURE IN EXACTLY THE WAY I WANT IT AND ALSO CONTROL THE AIR FLOW
g50rCJZrX0k_15 0 WHEN I STARTED I HAD TO USE A HAIR DRYER WHICH WAS OKAY BUT IT'S A LOT OF AIR AND NOT ENOUGH HEAT AND THEN THERE'S A THING CALLED AN EMBOSSING GUN THAT SCRAPBOOKERS USE AND AGAIN THAT'S TOO MUCH HEAT AND NOT ENOUGH AIR YOU CAN WORK TWO TOGETHER BUT THAT GETS TO BE A LITTLE CUMBERSOME SO AT SOME POINT YOU MIGHT INVEST IN A HEAVIER DUTY TOOL LIKE THIS
g50rCJZrX0k_16 0 AND THAT PRETTY MUCH COVERS THE TOOLS
GGqBF3C0vak_1 0 IF YOU WANT TO TEACH YOUR DOG TO WORK ON A TREADMILL SO THEY CAN GET SOME EXERCISE AND YOU HAVE A SMALL AREA IN WHICH TO EXERCISE YOUR DOG OR UNPLEASANT WEATHER THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO DO THE EXERCISE INSIDE FIRST YOU WOULD WANT TO ACCLIMATE YOUR DOG TO THE APPARATUS
GGqBF3C0vak_2 0 YOU WANT YOUR DOG TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH STANDING ON THE TREADMILL AND BEING AROUND THE TREADMILL MAYBE HEARING THE SOUND OF IT RUNNING BEFORE YOUR DOG IS ACTUALLY STANDING ON THE TREADMILL WHEN IT STARTS TO MOVE
GGqBF3C0vak_3 0 SO YOU MIGHT BEGIN BY OKAY UP TEACHING YOUR DOG TO GET UP ON THE TREADMILL AND STANDING THERE AND THEN BEING ABLE TO GET BACK OFF OF THE TREADMILL GOOD GIRL BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY WORK UP TO THE POINT WHERE YOU TURN THE TREADMILL ON AND YOUR DOG BEGINS TO WALK
GGqBF3C0vak_4 0 THIS IS AN ACTIVITY THAT IS POTENTIALLY FEAR INDUCING FOR YOUR DOG SO YOU WANT TO WORK SLOWLY AND TRY NOT TO HAVE ANY ACCIDENTS WHERE YOUR DOG ACTUALLY IS THROWN FROM THE TREADMILL WHICH WOULD MAKE YOUR DOG MUCH MORE WARY ABOUT PUTTING FOOT ON IT AGAIN
GGqBF3C0vak_5 0 YOU WANT TO WORK VERY SLOWLY INITIALLY GETTING THEM ONTO THE TREADMILL THEN RUNNING IT VERY SLOWLY SO YOUR DOG UNDERSTANDS THEY HAVE TO WALK ALWAYS BEING EXTREME CAUTIOUS TO KEEP ALL FOUR FEET ON THE TREADMILL
GGqBF3C0vak_6 0 NOW REMEMBER THAT DOGS WILL WORK TYPICALLY WITHOUT QUITTING WHEN THEY'VE GOTTEN TOO TIRED SO YOU WANT TO BE VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE OF YOUR DOG'S HEALTH THEIR HEART HEALTH AND WHEN TO STOP HOW LONG THAT THEY CAN EXERCISE AND THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THING TO WORK WITH A PROFESSIONAL AND WITH YOUR VETERINARIAN
H4x2NwdisV0_2 0 THIS IS JON ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
H4x2NwdisV0_3 0 IN THIS VIDEO CLIP I WILL BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO CHANGE A FURNACE FILTGER
H4x2NwdisV0_4 0 BEFORE YOU MOVE YOUR FILTER YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE AND NOTE THE DIRECTION OF AIR FLOW
H4x2NwdisV0_5 0 IT SHOULD BE INDICATED BY AN ARROW ON THE FILTER
H4x2NwdisV0_6 0 YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE SURE AND REMEMBER THIS FOR INSTALLING YOUR NEW FILTER
H4x2NwdisV0_7 0 AFTER THAT YOU WANT TO INSPECT YOUR FURNACE FILTER
H4x2NwdisV0_8 0 NOW IT SHOULDN'T BE VERY DARK LIKE THIS ONE IS
H4x2NwdisV0_9 0 THIS IS ONE IS PRETTY DIRTY
H4x2NwdisV0_10 0 YOUR'S SHOULD HAVE A NICE CLEAN LOOK
H4x2NwdisV0_11 0 IF IT WAS ORIGINALLY WHITE AND IT STILL IS WHITE IT IS VERY GOOD
H4x2NwdisV0_12 0 AGAIN THIS FILTER IS PRETTY DIRTY
H4x2NwdisV0_13 0 BEFORE YOU GO OUT AND BUY A NEW FILTER YOU NEED TO MAKE NOTE OF THE SIZE OF THE FILTER THAT YOU HAVE
H4x2NwdisV0_14 0 YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO BUY ONE THE EXACT SAME SIZE
H4x2NwdisV0_15 0 I PURCHASED THIS NEW FILTER OF THE SAME SIZE
H4x2NwdisV0_16 0 IN ADDITION THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT VARIATIONS YOU CAN GET WITH FILTERS DEPENDING IF YOU WANT TO FILTER OUT ALLERGENS OR ANYTHING ELSE
H4x2NwdisV0_17 0 WHEN YOU INSTALL IT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AIR FLOW INDICATOR IS POINTED IN THE CORRECT DIRECTION AND INSTALL YOUR NEW FILTER JUST IN THE REVERSE AS YOU TOOK THE OLD ONE OUT
gYvA5mYV2wY_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS ZEPHYR CLARKE DOLBERG FROM MIAMI DOG TRAINING
gYvA5mYV2wY_2 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO CHOOSE A GERMAN SHEPHERD
gYvA5mYV2wY_3 0 NOW FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS A PURE BRED DOG GERMAN SHEPHERD AND THE MORE PURE THE LINES THE MORE THEY WANT TO DO THEIR JOB
gYvA5mYV2wY_4 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GERMAN SHEPHERD YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR NICE STRONG BONES YOU WANT TO SEE BOTH PARENTS IF YOU CAN YOU WANT TO LEARN AS MUCH ABOUT THE HEREDITY THAT YOU CAN FROM THE DOG THAT YOU HAVE
gYvA5mYV2wY_5 0 SO IN CHOOSING A GERMAN SHEPHERD YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU WANT A SMALLER DOG
gYvA5mYV2wY_6 0 MAYBE YOU WANT TO TRY TO FIND LINES THAT ARE SMALLER
gYvA5mYV2wY_7 0 SOME LINES ARE BIGGER
gYvA5mYV2wY_8 0 THIS IS A HUGE FEMALE GERMAN SHEPHERD
gYvA5mYV2wY_9 0 AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE SHE LIKES TO WORK
gYvA5mYV2wY_10 0 NOW THIS IS ANOTHER KIND OF SHEPHERD
gYvA5mYV2wY_11 0 THIS IS A MIXED BREED
gYvA5mYV2wY_12 0 YOU CAN SEE HE'S MOSTLY SHEPHERD BUT THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT
gYvA5mYV2wY_13 0 NOTICE THE SHORTER SNOUT THEN THE STANDARD GERMAN SHEPHERD
gYvA5mYV2wY_14 0 HE'S GOT STAND UP EARS BUT THEIR NOT KIND OF BATTY LIKE THE GERMAN SHEPHERDS
gYvA5mYV2wY_15 0 AND IF YOU NOTICE HE DOESN'T HAVE COME ON STONEY HE DOESN'T HAVE A BODY SLOPE LIKE A GERMAN SHEPHERD
gYvA5mYV2wY_16 0 HE'S BUILT HIS BACK IS MUCH MORE LEVEL HIS TAIL'S SHORTER AND HE'S A LITTLE SMALLER BONED
gYvA5mYV2wY_17 0 BUT HE'S GOT A HIGH BRED VIGOR LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
gYvA5mYV2wY_18 0 SO SOMETIMES IN MIXED BREED MAYBE WHAT YOU WANT
gYvA5mYV2wY_19 0 A LOT OF TIMES THE MIXED BREEDS CAN BE HARDIER AND TEND TO DO REALLY WELL
gYvA5mYV2wY_20 0 THEY'RE GREAT DOGS AND THERE IS NO REASON ANYBODY SHOULDN'T WANT A MIXED BREED GERMAN SHEPHERD JUST AS WELL
gYvA5mYV2wY_21 0 THIS IS ZEPHYR CLARKE-DOLBERG AND THIS HAS BEEN HOW TO CHOOSE A GERMAN SHEPHERD
GCgetSnQEoc_1 0 SO IF IT HAS JUST SNOWED OUT AND IT IS REALLY LIGHT SNOW IT IS GOING TO BE REALLY HARD TO STOP AND IF THE SNOW IS THIS DEEP AND IF YOU ARE LUCKY THAT HAPPENS OUT IN COLORADO BUT NOT HERE
GCgetSnQEoc_2 0 YOU'LL TRY TO STOP AND YOU'LL JUST ALL THE SNOW IS ON TOP OF YOUR BOARD AND YOU'LL JUST END UP TOPPLING OVER SO YOU HAVE GOT TO THINK OF HOW FAST YOU ARE GOING
GCgetSnQEoc_3 0 IF YOU WANT TO STOP AND POWDER YOU HAVE ALWAYS GOT TO KEEP YOUR NOSE UP LEAN BACK WHICH DEFINITELY HELPS IF YOU RIDE BOARDS BECAUSE THEY ARE BUILT WITH THEIR STANDS BACK A LITTLE BIT BUT KEEP YOUR NOSE UP AND JUST TRY TO THINK OF IT LIKE THAT IF YOU WILL AND THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO STOP
GCgetSnQEoc_4 0 BUT IF YOU JUST STOP IN POWDER YOU'RE JUST GOING TO YOU'LL PROBABLY HIT A TREE BECAUSE THAT HAPPENS A LOT BECAUSE TREES ARE AROUND
GCgetSnQEoc_5 0 IF YOU ARE GOING REALLY FAST YOU'RE GOING TO TOGGLE OVER AND FLY INTO A TREE
GCgetSnQEoc_6 0 IT HAS HAPPENED TO ME BUT JUST TRY TO THINK OF HOW FAST YOU'RE GOING AND YOU'LL GET IT FROM THERE

Ha_nhhKLQvs_10 0 TO ME IT'S JUST TO SEW IT ALL AT ONE TIME AND IT DOES PRETTY GOOD

Ha_nhhKLQvs_26 0 SO NOW YOU'LL PUT YOUR NAME ADDRESS PHONE NUMBER ALL THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE HERE BUT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT EVERYBODY KNOWING THAT INFORMATION
Ha_nhhKLQvs_27 0 BEING A STAMPER I AM I STAMPED THE OTHER SIDE OF MINE
Ha_nhhKLQvs_28 0 NOW IT MATCHES THE TAG
Ha_nhhKLQvs_29 0 FACE THAT INSIDE OUT AND THEN YOU'RE READY TO GO
Ha_nhhKLQvs_30 0 NOW THERE IS NO DOUBT WHO'S LUGGAGE TAG THIS IS
G4WcRgmOXI4_1 0 TRAVELING FROM PRAGUE TO BERLIN IS A REAL ADVENTURE
G4WcRgmOXI4_2 0 ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO ARE MAD ABOUT MUSIC AND WHO ARE MUSICIANS
G4WcRgmOXI4_3 0 SO BERLIN IS REALLY FAMOUS FOR MANY MANY THINGS
G4WcRgmOXI4_4 0 THE BEAUTIFUL PRETTY ARCHITECTURE OF IT AND THE VERY FAMOUS GERMAN WRITERS AND AUTHORS AND PAINTERS AND ALL THOSE ARTISTS YOU MIGHT KNOW ABOUT
G4WcRgmOXI4_5 0 AND OF COURSE THE BEST THING IS WHEN YOU ARRIVE THERE YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT YOU'RE ALREADY AT BRANDENBURG GATE THE FAMOUS BERLIN BRANDENBURG GATE
G4WcRgmOXI4_6 0 SO GO THERE AND JUST TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND SMELL HISTORY
G4WcRgmOXI4_7 0 IF YOU WANT TO IDENTIFY YOUR CAR IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL YOU KNOW BUT JUST IN CASE YOU BOOK YOUR TICKET IN ADVANCE
G4WcRgmOXI4_8 0 THEN EVERYTHING WILL BE ON YOUR TICKET IN A VERY DETAILED FORM AND YOU CAN EASILY FIND YOUR CAR NUMBER
G4WcRgmOXI4_9 0 BUT IN CASE YOU DON'T BOOK IN ADVANCE THEN YOU SHOULD GO TO A TRAIN ATTENDANT AND ASK THE TRAIN ATTENDANT WHERE TO GO AND WHAT TO DO
G4WcRgmOXI4_10 0 AND THEN THE TRAIN ATTENDANT WILL SHOW YOU YOUR CAR
G4WcRgmOXI4_11 0 AND OF COURSE THERE ARE CERTAIN NUMBERS ON YOUR TICKET THAT MIGHT BE NUMBERS ON YOUR TICKET
G4WcRgmOXI4_12 0 SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY ON THE TRAVEL A TRAIN TRAVEL FROM PRAGUE TO BERLIN IS NOT THAT NECESSARY
G4WcRgmOXI4_13 0 SO IN CASE YOU'D LIKE TO BUY A SECOND CLASS TICKET YOU CAN SAVE MONEY ON YOUR WAY TO BERLIN
G4WcRgmOXI4_14 0 THE LAST THING IS THAT YOU SHOULDN'T FORGET ABOUT GETTING TO THE INFORMATION CENTER BEFORE GETTING TO BERLIN STILL IN PRAGUE
G4WcRgmOXI4_15 0 SO IF YOU GO TO THE INFO CENTER YOU WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO PREPARE
G4WcRgmOXI4_16 0 YOU CAN CHECK THE TIME TABLE OUT THAT'S THE POINT
G4WcRgmOXI4_17 0 AND THESE INFORMATION OFFICES ARE MOSTLY OPEN BETWEEN THREE A.M AND ELEVEN FORTY-FIVE P.M BEFORE GOING FROM PRAGUE TO BERLIN GETTING TO THE PRAGUE STATION IT'S GOOD TO USE THE RED LINES THESE ARE METRO LINES
G4WcRgmOXI4_18 0 AND THERE ARE TWO MAIN STATIONS IN PRAGUE AND BOTH RAILWAY STATIONS ARE TO BE REACHED WITH THE HELP OF THIS RED LINE
G4WcRgmOXI4_19 0 DON'T FORGET ABOUT THIS
h9PawU0t-ys_1 0 OFF ROAD TRIATHLONS TYPICALLY HAVE A ROUGH WATER SWIM AND THAT'S ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF THE OFF ROAD TRIATHLON
h9PawU0t-ys_2 0 TO PREPARE FOR THAT THERE IS REALLY NOTHING YOU CAN DO OTHER THEN SWIM IN ROUGH WATER
h9PawU0t-ys_3 0 IF YOU HAVE A LOCAL TRIATHLON CLUB IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A LAKE WHEN YOU ARE AT THE BEACH PUT ON YOUR WET SUIT AND GET OUT THERE AND TO FEEL THAT FEELING OF THAT WATER HITTING YOU AND EITHER DIVING THROUGH THE WAVES AND BREAKING THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE OR JUST ROLLING WITH IT AND GET COMFORTABLE WITH IT
h9PawU0t-ys_4 0 THE MORE TIME YOU SPEND SWIMMING IN A WET SUIT UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS YOU'LL FEEL SAFER AND YOU'LL FEEL COMFORTABLE
h9PawU0t-ys_5 0 THE WET SUIT WILL GIVE YOU A LOT MORE COMFORT IN THAT SITUATION BECAUSE OF THE ADDED BUOYANCY
h9PawU0t-ys_6 0 SWIMMING IN A WET SUIT IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THEN SWIMMING WITHOUT ONE
h9PawU0t-ys_7 0 YOU'LL PROBABLY USE ONE TO TWO STROKES LESS PER LENGTH YOU'LL GLIDE MORE AND YOU'LL RIDE HIGHER IN THE WATER
h9PawU0t-ys_8 0 SO IF YOU CAN TAKE IT INTO THE POOL AND SWIM A BIT IN IT JUST TO GET ACCUSTOMED TO IT IT FEELS VERY DIFFERENT
h9PawU0t-ys_9 0 IT'S EFFICIENT AND THE POORER SWIMMING YOU ARE THE MORE YOU'LL GAIN TIME WITH THE WET SUIT
h9PawU0t-ys_10 0 IF YOU HAVE REALLY GOOD BODY POSITION ALREADY THE WET SUIT WON'T PICK UP A LOT OF TIME BUT MOST PEOPLE WILL SEE A THREE TO FIVE SECOND PER HUNDRED IMPROVEMENT
h9PawU0t-ys_11 0 AND THAT'S A REALLY NICE THING
h9PawU0t-ys_12 0 ANOTHER NICE THING OF COURSE IS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO WEAR WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO RUN AND BIKE IN UNDERNEATH THE WET SUIT AND THEN JUST PEEL IT OFF AND BE READY TO GO
h9PawU0t-ys_13 0 SO EVEN THOUGH YOU LOSE A BIT OF TIME TAKING THE WET SUIT OFF YOU GAIN IT BY HAVING THAT GEAR UNDERNEATH
h9PawU0t-ys_14 0 SOME OTHER SPECIFICS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OPEN WATER SWIMMING IS YOU NEED TO GET USED TO STARTING FAST
h9PawU0t-ys_15 0 IT'S REAL EASY TO GET LULLED INTO THE GROUP YOU ARE WITH SO YOU WANT TO GET OFF THE LINE QUICK AND YOU CAN PRACTICE THAT IN SWIMMING BY DOING SOME FAST FIFTIES RIGHT BEFORE YOU DO YOUR LONG SETS OR SOME THINGS LIKE THAT
h9PawU0t-ys_16 0 TO GET OUT AND THEN QUICKLY SETTLE DOWN INTO YOUR RHYTHM YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST KIND OF EASE INTO THE THING YOU GET INTO A SLOW GROUP
h9PawU0t-ys_17 0 IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO A LAKE TO SWIM WITH A LOCAL TRIATHLON CLUB OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND PRACTICE OPEN WATER SWIMMING THAT'S A GREAT THING TO DO YOU CAN PRACTICE DRAFTING OFF SOMEBODY WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SWIM RIGHT CLOSE BEHIND AND AGAIN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S JUST BEST TO EXPERIENCE BY DOING IT
h9PawU0t-ys_18 0 SOME OTHER THINGS THAT YOU CAN PRACTICE IN THE POOL IS SIDING AND IN OPEN WATER SWIM EVERY SIX TO EIGHT STROKES YOU NEED TO CHOP THE STROKE SHORT AND STICK YOUR HEAD UP
h9PawU0t-ys_19 0 AND STAYING ON COURSE IS A WHOLE OTHER ASPECT OF OPEN WATER SWIMMING
h9PawU0t-ys_20 0 SO TRY TO PICK SOMETHING ON THE SHORELINE NOT THE BUOY THAT YOU ARE SWIMMING FOR BUT A BOAT RAMP OR A HOME OR A LAMP POLE OR SOMETHING SO THAT IF YOU'VE GOT A SEA OF BRIGHT ORANGE CAPS IN FRONT OF YOU THAT YOU STILL KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SWIMMING FOR
h9PawU0t-ys_21 0 SO THOSE ARE SOME REAL KEY AND SPECIFIC THINGS FOR WHEN YOU TACKLE THAT OPEN WATER SWIM
guHNF8-ezUc_1 0 THE RULES OF THE GAME
guHNF8-ezUc_2 0 WELL THERE ARE MANY RULES OF THE GAME
guHNF8-ezUc_3 0 THERE IS A SCORING RULE THAT SAYS THAT MOST OF THE STANDARD GAMES ARE FIVE HUNDRED POINTS
guHNF8-ezUc_4 0 NOW THAT FIVE HUNDRED POINTS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE POINTS IN SPADES
guHNF8-ezUc_5 0 FIVE HUNDRED POINTS YOU EARN POINTS FOR YOUR HAND YOU EARN POINTS FOR YOUR BID
guHNF8-ezUc_6 0 NOW BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER IF WE TAKE A DECK OF CARDS AND WE SHUFFLE THEM AND THIS IS A DECK OF EIGHTY CARDS MAY I ADD WE'RE GOING TO DEAL
guHNF8-ezUc_7 0 NOW THESE MAY NOT COME OUT AS A PERFECT SHUFFLE BUT WE'LL CERTAINLY DO OUR BEST TO
guHNF8-ezUc_8 0 IF WE DEAL THESE ONE AT A TIME WE'LL BE FOREVER AND THREE SUNDAYS TRYING TO DEAL EVERY HAND OUT
guHNF8-ezUc_9 0 SO WHAT THEY DO AT TOURNAMENTS IS YOU'RE ALLOWED TO DEAL FOUR OR FIVE AT A TIME
guHNF8-ezUc_10 0 IT JUST SPEEDS UP THE PROCESS
guHNF8-ezUc_11 0 UNLESS YOU'RE LIKE ME AND YOU HAVE A HARD TIME COUNTING FOUR CARDS ON A DEAL
guHNF8-ezUc_12 0 BUT WE NEED TO LOOK AT ILLUSTRATIVE HANDS BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT WE'RE NOT REALLY GOING TO UNDERSTAND THE BASICS AND PRINCIPLES OF THE GAME
guHNF8-ezUc_13 0 WE HAVE FIVE CARDS HERE BUT I'M NOT GOING TO WORRY ABOUT THAT AT THE MOMENT
guHNF8-ezUc_14 0 UNLESS THERE'S LIFT ON ONE BUT THAT'S OKAY
guHNF8-ezUc_15 0 WHEN WE OPEN UP OUR HAND THREE SIX NINE TWELVE THIRTEEN TWENTY-ONE
guHNF8-ezUc_16 0 SO WE'LL ASSUME THAT THERE'S AN ODD CARD HERE WHICH IS FINE
guHNF8-ezUc_17 0 WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS IDENTIFY EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
guHNF8-ezUc_18 0 SO WE WANT TO TAKE OUR HAND AND WE WANT TO SORT IT ACCORDING TO THE RANK AND ORDER OF THE CARDS THAT WE HAVE AND YOU REALLY HAVE TO DO THIS FOR EACH SUIT
guHNF8-ezUc_19 0 THIS IS THE WAY THIS IS ALL THE SPADES THAT I HAVE OKAY
guHNF8-ezUc_20 0 YOU WILL NOT GET ANYWHERE IN PINOCHLE IF YOU DON'T SORT YOUR HAND PROPERLY
guHNF8-ezUc_21 0 YOU'VE GOT TWENTY CARDS SO IT WOULD BE AN ABSOLUTELY A VERY MISERABLE TIME TRYING TO TRACK WHAT YOU'VE GOT AND I PREFER TO ALTERNATE THE SUITS BECAUSE IT JUST MAKES LIFE EASIER
guHNF8-ezUc_22 0 I DON'T NEED TO SPREAD THIS OUT TOO MUCH BUT NOW WE HAVE A NINE IN HERE THAT'S WHY I OVERLOOKED THAT YOU CAN DO THAT IN YOUR OWN HOUSE
guHNF8-ezUc_23 0 OKAY THIS IS THEY WAY A SORTED PINOCHLE SORTED PINOCHLE HAND SHOULD LOOK OKAY
guHNF8-ezUc_24 0 THIS MAKES IT EASIER FOR YOU TO EVALUATE THE HAND OKAY
guHNF8-ezUc_25 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO THE MELDING TABLE AND WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO OTHER ASPECTS OF THE GAME BUT BEFORE YOU START BEFORE YOU EVALUATE YOUR HAND YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO SORT THE HAND OUT BY SUIT
guHNF8-ezUc_26 0 IF YOU LOOK HERE WE HAVE WHAT
guHNF8-ezUc_27 0 A SEVEN CARD SPADE SUIT AND SO FORTH SO ONCE YOU GET THAT DONE YOU CAN THEN GO TO THE NEXT SECTION OF THE LECTURE THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE MELDING TABLE
guHNF8-ezUc_28 0 SO THIS IS OUR FIRST STEP AND SORT THE HAND OUT AND THEN WE'LL GET INTO THE BIDDING PROCESS
GGn31ESH8Kg_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS BARRY PAYNE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GGn31ESH8Kg_2 0 IN THIS LAST UNIT ON THE FACE TO FACE SKILLS OF SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATORS WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE WAY INFORMATION IS HANDLED
GGn31ESH8Kg_3 0 TAKE A LOOK AT THE CHART
GGn31ESH8Kg_4 0 THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MODELS THAT I CAN RECOMMEND TO YOU
GGn31ESH8Kg_5 0 SKILLED PEOPLE ONE IN FIVE THINGS THAT THEY SAY IS A QUESTION
GGn31ESH8Kg_6 0 DUMB PEOPLE DON'T ASK QUESTIONS
GGn31ESH8Kg_7 0 SKILLED PEOPLE ASK QUESTIONS
GGn31ESH8Kg_8 0 LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT WHY
GGn31ESH8Kg_9 0 FIRST OF ALL IF YOU REMEMBER I TOLD YOU EARLIER THAT SKILLED PEOPLE GIVE VERY LITTLE FACT AND OPINION
GGn31ESH8Kg_10 0 THEY TALK ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS AND HOW THE OTHER SIDE IS IMPACTING THEM IN THE NEGOTIATION BUT THEY DON'T GIVE AWAY MANY FACTS OR OPINIONS
GGn31ESH8Kg_11 0 IN FACT THE MORE INFORMATION I HAVE ABOUT YOU THE BETTER OFF I AM
GGn31ESH8Kg_12 0 THE LESS INFORMATION YOU HAVE ABOUT ME THE BETTER OFF I AM
GGn31ESH8Kg_13 0 ASKING QUESTIONS MEANS THE INFORMATION IS FLOWING IN WHICH DIRECTION
GGn31ESH8Kg_14 0 IT'S FLOWING FROM YOU TO ME
GGn31ESH8Kg_15 0 SO IF I'M ASKING THE QUESTIONS I'M GETTING INFORMATION
GGn31ESH8Kg_16 0 IN NEGOTIATION INFORMATION IS POWER
GGn31ESH8Kg_17 0 THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER REASONS WHY QUESTIONS ARE SO USEFUL TO THE SKILLED NEGOTIATOR
GGn31ESH8Kg_18 0 QUESTIONS CAN GIVE YOU A BREATHING SPACE AND KEEP THE OTHER SIDE ACTIVE
GGn31ESH8Kg_19 0 THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU NEED TO PAUSE AND THINK WITHOUT TAKING A BREAK
GGn31ESH8Kg_20 0 QUESTIONS CAN HELP YOU DO THAT
GGn31ESH8Kg_21 0 QUESTIONS ALSO EXPOSE THINGS WHICH OTHERWISE WOULDN'T ARISE
GGn31ESH8Kg_22 0 LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
GGn31ESH8Kg_23 0 CAN YOU GIVE ME ANOTHER FIVE PERCENT SAYS THE NEGOTIATOR.
GGn31ESH8Kg_24 0 THE OTHER SIDE SAYS NO
GGn31ESH8Kg_25 0 CAN ANYONE GIVE ME ANOTHER FIVE PERCENT
GGn31ESH8Kg_26 0 WELL SAYS THE OTHER MANAGER IF ANYONE CAN MY DIRECTOR CAN
GGn31ESH8Kg_27 0 NEXT QUESTION WILL HE GIVE ME FIVE PERCENT
GGn31ESH8Kg_28 0 THE ANSWER YES
GGn31ESH8Kg_29 0 I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT I MEAN THAT WAS A WONDERFUL CONCESSION HE OBTAINED JUST BY ASKING THREE QUESTIONS
GGn31ESH8Kg_30 0 OK ANOTHER QUESTION
GGn31ESH8Kg_31 0 WHAT'S YOUR SUPPLY SITUATION AT THE MOMENT SAYS THE BUYER
GGn31ESH8Kg_32 0 IT'S FINE WE'VE GOT A SURPLUS IN THE WAREHOUSE RIGHT NOW
GGn31ESH8Kg_33 0 IS THAT USEFUL TO KNOW
GGn31ESH8Kg_34 0 OF COURSE IT'S USEFUL TO KNOW IF THEY'VE GOT A SURPLUS THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF CASH TIED UP IN THE WAREHOUSE SO THEY MIGHT MAKE CONCESSIONS TO MOVE IT
GGn31ESH8Kg_35 0 SO QUESTIONS CAN GET FACTS WHICH WILL HELP YOU AND IT CAN CAUSE THE OTHER SIDE TO GIVE THINGS AWAY WHICH CAN BE BENEFICIAL TO YOUR PARTY
gCqPbElqxwA_1 0 TODAY WE'RE HERE TO SHOW YOU THE HOW TO'S ON BMX
gCqPbElqxwA_2 0 THIS ONE'S CALL THE MANUAL
gCqPbElqxwA_3 0 NOW THE MANUAL IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE TRICKS IN BMX
gCqPbElqxwA_4 0 YOU WANT TO TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO LEARN BUT OVER TIME YOU'RE GOING TO START GETTING IT MORE AND MORE
gCqPbElqxwA_5 0 NOW THE BEST WAY TO LEARN IT TO ME IS TO GET ON YOUR BIKE EVERY TIME
gCqPbElqxwA_6 0 YOU PULL IT OUT OF YOUR GARAGE JUST TRY AND POP A WHEELIE
gCqPbElqxwA_7 0 BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MANUAL AND A WHEELIE IS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PEDDLE
gCqPbElqxwA_8 0 IT'S THE KEY FEATURE TOWARDS THE MANUAL
gCqPbElqxwA_9 0 IT'S WAY COOLER THAN WHEELING
gCqPbElqxwA_10 0 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE MADE FUN OF IF YOU CAN DO A REALLY LONG MANUAL
gCqPbElqxwA_11 0 YOU MAY GET MADE FUN OF IF YOU CAN DO A REALLY LONG WHEELIE
gCqPbElqxwA_12 0 SO THE BASIC ELEMENTS TO THE MANUAL IS THAT YOU COUNTER BALANCE YOUR BODY WITH THE FRONT END OF YOUR BIKE
gCqPbElqxwA_13 0 USING THE BACK WHEEL KIND OF LIKE A UNICYCLE OR SOMETHING
gCqPbElqxwA_14 0 SO YOU WANT TO MAKE A LITTLE V WITH YOUR BODY AND THE FRONT END OF YOUR BIKE AND JUST KIND OF BALANCE THEM OFF
gCqPbElqxwA_15 0 OVER TIME THIS MANUAL IS GOING TO COME AROUND BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
gCqPbElqxwA_16 0 THE VERY FIRST TIMES YOU TRY IT YOU DON'T WANT TO PULL BACK TOO MUCH BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO LOOP OUT
gCqPbElqxwA_17 0 AND YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO PULL UP ENOUGH SO YOU GET THE FRONT END UP A LITTLE BIT
gCqPbElqxwA_18 0 BUT THERE'S JUST LIKE THERE'S A CERTAIN SPOT YOU JUST GOT TO TEETER WITH IT
gCqPbElqxwA_19 0 KEEP PLAYING WITH IT A YEAR OF BIKE RIDING EVERY TIME YOU GET ON YOUR BIKE DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT
gCqPbElqxwA_20 0 JUST TRY AND BUST A MANUAL GO A LITTLE FASTER JUST BE READY
gCqPbElqxwA_21 0 BECAUSE IF YOU PULL UP TOO MUCH YOU'RE GOING TO LOOP BACKWARDS
gCqPbElqxwA_22 0 LET ME TELL YOU THERE'S SO MANY THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH BMX AND THE MANUAL
gCqPbElqxwA_23 0 LET ME SHOW YOU AGAIN
gCqPbElqxwA_24 0 JUST GOT TO GET SOME ROOM HERE DEFINITELY WANT TO GIVE YOURSELF SOME ROOM
gCqPbElqxwA_25 0 YOU WANT TO PICK UP A LITTLE BIT OF SPEED PULL UP THE FRONT END COUNTER BALANCE JUST LET IT GO
gCqPbElqxwA_26 0 RIDE IT OUT AS LONG AS YOU CAN THEY STILL HAVEN'T BROKEN THE RECORD WITH THE MANUAL
gCqPbElqxwA_27 0 I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT IS BUT JEEZ ANY BODY CAN DO IT
gCqPbElqxwA_28 0 JUST TAKES TIME
gCqPbElqxwA_29 0 AND REMEMBER NO PEDDLING EVEN IF YOU TAKE A LITTLE RATCHET CRANK THAT'S CHEATING
gCqPbElqxwA_30 0 WE DON'T LIKE THAT
gCqPbElqxwA_31 0 JUST KEEP IT NICE AND STEADY NO PEDDLING ALL PUMPING STRAIGHT DOWN THE STREET
gCqPbElqxwA_32 0 MANUAL YOUR WAY TO A NEW WAY OF BIKE RIDING
gqbRaYZtNKo_1 0 DURING THIS SERIES WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT IS THE USES OF THE SPINDLE GOUGE AND THE SKEW AND THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CUTS THAT YOU CAN GET WITH THESE TOOLS ON THE LATHE
gqbRaYZtNKo_2 0 YOU WILL BE USING THE SKEW TO SMOOTH THE WORK DOWN MAKE VEE CUTS CUT BEADS SQUARE OFF THE END OF THE STOCK
gqbRaYZtNKo_3 0 YOU WILL BE USING THE GOUGE TO CUT COVES THE DEPRESSIONS WITHIN THE WOOD AND CUT BEADS
gqbRaYZtNKo_4 0 WE WILL ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT THE VARIOUS PROBLEMS THAT YOU RUN INTO IN USING THESE TOOLS COMMON TECHNIQUE ERRORS THAT BEGINNERS MAKE AND TO MENTION TO YOU WHAT IT IS THAT YOU ARE DOING THAT IS CAUSING THIS SO IN YOUR PRACTICE YOU CAN GO BACK AND IMPROVE YOUR TECHNIQUE TO PRODUCE A MORE SMOOTHER AND HIGHER QUALITY WORK THAT REQUIRES LESS SANDING AND FINISHING
gk-utBn_u5s_1 0 OK LET'S CONTINUE NOW WE'RE GOING TO PRESS ON WITH THE REAR PERSON NOW
gk-utBn_u5s_2 0 WE'VE DEALT WITH THE FRONT PERSON QUITE A BIT
gk-utBn_u5s_3 0 LET'S GET THAT FAR THOUGH
gk-utBn_u5s_4 0 THERE'S ONE TWO I'M THREE FOUR HERE'S THAT TSUKI WITH THE BOUNCE HERE SHOMEN
gk-utBn_u5s_5 0 NOW WE'VE STRUCK SHOMEN AND JUST AS I DID OVER HERE THEY'RE GOING TO ATTACK WITH A TSUKI A STABBING STRIKE TO MY MID-SECTION
gk-utBn_u5s_6 0 I NEED TO GET OFF THE LINE AND PARRY THAT DOWN
gk-utBn_u5s_7 0 IT'S IDENTICAL TO THE MOTION WE DID HERE PREVIOUSLY
gk-utBn_u5s_8 0 SO I CAME TSUKI TO SHOMEN
gk-utBn_u5s_9 0 I'M ROLLING THIS I'M HERE AT MY CENTER TRYING TO KEEP THE MOTION VERY SMALL
gk-utBn_u5s_10 0 DON'T GET INTO A BATON TWIRLING CONTEST
gk-utBn_u5s_11 0 IT'S A SMALL MOTION YOU'RE DEFENDING YOUR LIFE
gk-utBn_u5s_12 0 SO I CAME HERE TO SHOMEN I WANT TO MOVE OFF THE LINE DROP THE TIP SO IT'S OUT OF THE WAY AND DROP IT ON TOP OF THE SWORD
gk-utBn_u5s_13 0 THE BLADE WILL BE RUNNING DIRECTLY AT MY CENTER DOWN THIS LINE RIGHT HERE FOLLOWING THE TRACK OF THE JO
gk-utBn_u5s_14 0 I'M OUT OF THE WAY ONE I'M MISSING THE STABBING MOTION TO BEGIN WITH
gk-utBn_u5s_15 0 AND TWO NOW I CAN TAP THE TOP OF THE BLADE AND DRIVE IT INTO THE GROUND
gk-utBn_u5s_16 0 WE JUST CAME SHOMEN UCHI
gk-utBn_u5s_17 0 OFF THE LINE AND PARRY THE BLADE DOWN
gk-utBn_u5s_18 0 AND HERE IN A MOMENT WE'LL CONTINUE OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PERSON TO THE REAR
G4RAZyip8ko_1 0 SO BECAUSE WATER PURIFICATION SYSTEMS ARE SO IMPORTANT THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT KINDS THAT YOU CAN USE
G4RAZyip8ko_2 0 THE EASIEST IS ACTUALLY BOILING WATER
G4RAZyip8ko_3 0 YOU CAN JUST BOIL THE WATER AND IT WILL KILL ALL THE BACTERIA AND THINGS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HARM YOU
G4RAZyip8ko_4 0 IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO BOIL WATER AND IT IS NOT ALWAYS PRACTICAL ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIDDY CAMP OVEN YOU CAN'T BOIL A WHOLE LOT OF WATER AT ONCE
G4RAZyip8ko_5 0 THERE IS ALSO TWO COMMON WAYS TO DO IT THAT ARE IODINE TABLETS OR BLEACH
G4RAZyip8ko_6 0 THE IODINE TABLETS COME IN A LITTLE BOTTLE WITH LIKE A LITTLE COTTON BALL ON TOP AND YOU JUST PUT ONE OF THE TABLETS IN THERE AND YOU WAIT FOR A HALF AN HOUR OR WHATEVER IT SAYS ON THE BOTTLE AND THEN THE WATER IS BASICALLY GOOD TO DRINK IT TAKES CARE OF ALL THE STUFF THAT'S IN THE WATER
G4RAZyip8ko_7 0 IODINE TABLETS TASTE OR THE IODINE WATER AFTER YOU MAKE IT IT TASTES KIND OF LIKE RUSTY PIPE WATER BASICALLY
G4RAZyip8ko_8 0 I GREW UP ON TEXAS WELL WATER SO I DON'T EVEN TASTE IT BUT IT BOTHERS A LOT OF PEOPLE SO THEY CAN USE THE BLEACH AND THE BLEACH TABLETS ACTUALLY MAKE YOUR WATER TASTE SUPER SUPER CHLORINATED WHICH I CAN'T STAND BUT IF YOU CAN'T STAND EITHER OF THOSE TASTES WHAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO IS JUST BRING GATORADE PACKETS AND THAT WILL ALSO HELP YOU REPLENISH THE SALT AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEED FOR THE DAY AND IT WILL MASK THE NASTY TASTES OF THE IODINE THAT IS ALSO PUMPING THROUGH FILTERS BUT IT IS NOT AS THOROUGH AND YOU REALLY SHOULD USE THE IODINE TABLETS OR THE BLEACH ON TOP OF PUMPING IT THROUGH A FILTER
GYT8VoWz17U_1 0 O'KAY IN THIS CLIP WE ARE GOING TO BE USING AN INFLATABLE BALL TO HELP STRENGTHEN THE LOW BACK
GYT8VoWz17U_2 0 IT IS ALMOST LIKE A LOW BACK STRENGTHENING EXERCISE SO IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO GET OUT TO AN EXERCISE FACILITY THAT HAS A LOW BACK MACHINE THIS IS A GOOD OPTION
GYT8VoWz17U_3 0 YOU ARE GOING TO PLACE YOUR BALL JUST A LITTLE BIT BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES O'KAY
GYT8VoWz17U_4 0 YOU CAN DO THIS ON ANY CHAIR OR BENCH AND WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO IS YOU ARE GOING TO PUSH BACK GENTLY AND THEN COME FORWARD
GYT8VoWz17U_5 0 O'KAY LET'S GET THE RIGHT SPOT
GYT8VoWz17U_6 0 YOU ARE GOING TO PUSH BACK IT IS A VERY SMALL MOVEMENT AND THEN COME FORWARD KEEPING YOUR BACK NICE AND STRAIGHT PUSH BACK GETTING THAT RESISTANCE OF THE BALL BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES AND THEN COME FORWARD
GYT8VoWz17U_7 0 THIS IS A VERY SMALL MOVEMENT BUT IT IS VERY EFFECTIVE
GYT8VoWz17U_8 0 O'KAY YOU ARE GOING TO PUSH BACK PRESSING AGAINST THE INFLATED BALL AND THEN RELAXING THE SHOULDERS AND BACK FORWARD
GYT8VoWz17U_9 0 YOU ARE GOING TO PRESS BACK AND KEEP YOUR HANDS FIRMLY ON YOUR THIGHS AND THEN RELAX THE BODY FORWARD
g524tYzDE0Y_1 0 HI I'M MATT CAIL AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A SCARECROW COSTUME
g524tYzDE0Y_2 0 THEN WE COME TO SOCKS
g524tYzDE0Y_3 0 NOW THERE ARE TWO LINES OF THINKING WHEN IT COMES TO SOCKS AND SCARECROWS
g524tYzDE0Y_4 0 ONE OF THEM IS THAT SOCKS SHOULD BE BRIGHTER COLORS
g524tYzDE0Y_5 0 RED AND WHITE STRIPES
g524tYzDE0Y_6 0 THAT SORT OF THING FOR A SCARECROW
g524tYzDE0Y_7 0 IT'S KIND OF ONE OF THE AREAS YOU CAN BE A LITTLE BRIGHT AND CHEERFUL ON THE SCARECROW BODY
g524tYzDE0Y_8 0 I HAVE NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD THAT
g524tYzDE0Y_9 0 AND I LIKE TO KIND OF GO A LITTLE MORE TRADITIONAL
g524tYzDE0Y_10 0 I MEAN SCARECROWS ARE OUTSIDE
g524tYzDE0Y_12 0 SO I ACTUALLY LIKE TO HAVE KIND OF THICKER MORE COTTONY SOCKS
g524tYzDE0Y_13 0 GENERALLY IN MORE SUBDUED SHADES
g524tYzDE0Y_14 0 SUCH AS HAVING THIS IN BLACK AND GRAYS OR ALSO BROWNS
g524tYzDE0Y_15 0 EVEN LIGHT BROWNS WOULD PROBABLY WORK
g524tYzDE0Y_16 0 THIS IS ALSO GREAT BECAUSE THE THICKER COTTON SOCKS WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO KIND OF STUFF MORE THINGS INTO THE SCARECROW LATER ON WHICH WE ARE GOING TO GET TOO
g524tYzDE0Y_17 0 WHERE AS THIN DRESS SOCK WE ARE NOT REALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO STUFF ANYTHING IN THERE
g524tYzDE0Y_18 0 IT ALSO COULD GET ITCHY IF YOU TRIED TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
g524tYzDE0Y_19 0 SO FOR SOCKS I GENERALLY RECOMMEND A GRAY AND BLACK SHADES TO HAVE THERE
g524tYzDE0Y_20 0 IN ADDITION SOME THINGS YOU CAN THINK OF YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE YOU ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO WANT TO HAVE SOCKS
g524tYzDE0Y_21 0 SOME SCARECROWS DON'T HAVE FEET AT ALL
g524tYzDE0Y_22 0 BUT OF COURSE YOU ARE A HUMAN YOU HAVE FEET
g524tYzDE0Y_23 0 YOU ARE GOING TO NEED SOME SOCKS
GBeNNE0i7cw_1 0 FROM TADASANA TAKE A WIDE LEG STANCE FOUR TO FIVE FEET APART AND THEN CHECK OUT YOUR SECOND TOES MAKE SURE THEY'RE PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER AND TO THE OUTER EDGES OF THE MAT THAT THEY'RE MAKING PARALLEL LINES THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE ANKLE AND THE CENTER OF THE HEEL
GBeNNE0i7cw_2 0 THEN TURN YOUR RIGHT FOOT OUT AND LINE UP THE RIGHT HEEL SO THAT IT BISECTS THE LEFT ARCH AND THEN TAKE A DEEP BEND IN YOUR RIGHT LEG
GBeNNE0i7cw_3 0 AS YOUR RIGHT LEG BENDS DEEPLY TAKE YOUR RIGHT FOREARM TO THE TOP OF YOUR RIGHT THIGH AND YOUR LEFT HAND TO YOUR HIP
GBeNNE0i7cw_4 0 RECEIVE YOUR BREATH AND ALLOW YOUR SKIN TO SOFTEN AND THEN AS YOU RECEIVE THE BREATH ENGAGE THE LEG MUSCLES SO THE LEGS ARE FIRM
GBeNNE0i7cw_5 0 DRAW ENERGY TO THE CORE OF THE PELVIS AND THEN FROM THE CORE OF THE PELVIS SCOOP THE TAILBONE DOWN AND EXTEND THROUGH THE LEGS
GBeNNE0i7cw_6 0 GOOD NOW STRETCH YOUR LEFT ARM OVER YOUR HEAD AND DRAW THE LEFT SHOULDER BACK DRAW THE RIGHT SHOULDER BACK AND OPEN UP THE POSE TURNING YOUR HEART TOWARD THE SKY
GBeNNE0i7cw_7 0 PUSHING INTO YOUR FEET INHALE RISE BACK UP TURN YOUR RIGHT FOOT IN TURN YOUR LEFT FOOT OUT TAKE A DEEP BEND IN YOUR LEFT LEG
GBeNNE0i7cw_8 0 AS THE LEFT LEG BENDS DEEPLY TAKE THE FOREARM TO THE THIGH THE RIGHT HAND TO THE HIP DEEPEN YOUR BREATH AND THEN SWEEP YOUR RIGHT ARM UP AND OVER YOUR HEAD
GBeNNE0i7cw_9 0 TURN YOUR HEART OPEN TOWARD THE SKY AND THEN INHALE LIFT ALL THE WAY BACK UP TURN THE LEFT FOOT IN TO COME BACK TO CENTER
G-ccBHPfCs8_1 0 HEY WELCOME EVERYBODY MY NAME IS LARS ERIK ROBINSON AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU GUYS HOW TO DRAW WITH PASTELS
G-ccBHPfCs8_2 0 MY PARTNERS HERE MY FRIENDS HERE AT THE STUDIOS WANTS ME TO DO SOME KIND OF SPACESHIP IN PASTELS SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO IS MORE OF A SPACESHIP SLASH PLANE HERE
G-ccBHPfCs8_3 0 SO AS YOU CAN SEE AS I'M APPLYING THE PASTEL IT'S A VERY CHALKY KIND OF MEDIUM AND IF YOU CAN CLOSE IN ON THIS WHILE I'M DOING IT YOU CAN SEE THE CHALK JUST COMING RIGHT OFF
G-ccBHPfCs8_4 0 AND THAT'S WHY IT'S VERY IMPERATIVE WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH THIS KIND OF WORK YOU PUT A FIXATIVE ON THIS KIND OF THING SO IT STAYS ON THE PAPER
G-ccBHPfCs8_5 0 SO WE'RE DOING THIS HERE SEE WE'RE GOING TO PUT SOME JETS PUT SOME JETS RIGHT THERE
G-ccBHPfCs8_6 0 WE'LL CHANGE THE COLOR
G-ccBHPfCs8_7 0 NOW THIS IS GREAT BECAUSE YOU CAN DO A SMUDGING TECHNIQUE ON THIS WHICH SOMETIMES OTHER ARTISTS SAY OH THAT'S CHEATING YOU'RE SHADING IT YOU'RE LOSING ALL THE TEXTURE
G-ccBHPfCs8_8 0 SO IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A CLEAN SLICK LOOK LIKE WE'RE DOING A SPACESHIP THAT'S OBVIOUSLY MADE OUT OF MEDAL SO WE'RE ALL RIGHT TO SMUDGE THAT IN
G-ccBHPfCs8_9 0 BUT WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO CREATE A MOVEMENT HERE
G-ccBHPfCs8_10 0 SO IF YOU KNOW WHERE THE MOVEMENT IS GOING TAKE YOUR DRY PART OF YOUR TOWEL AND JUST IT ADDS TO YOUR EFFECT IF YOU NOTICE THE STREAKS THERE
G-ccBHPfCs8_11 0 WE'LL TAKE THE YELLOW WHERE'S THE OUTLINE ON IT YOU'RE WONDERING
G-ccBHPfCs8_12 0 HERE COMES THE OUTLINE
G-ccBHPfCs8_13 0 YOU KNOW SOMETIMES I CAN OVERDO MY OUTLINE I THINK IT'S ALL MY CARICATURE DRAWINGS I'VE DONE OVER THE YEARS
G-ccBHPfCs8_14 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING ALL BLACK ALL THE TIME BUT BECAUSE OF THIS PURPOSE WE'RE TRYING TO SHOW YOU GUYS HOW TO DO SOMETHING QUICK AND IT'S A GREAT WAY OF DOING IT
G-ccBHPfCs8_15 0 YOU CAN EVEN TAKE A BRUSH TO FADE IT WITH YOU COULD TAKE THE SIDE OF THIS BRUSH AND IT BLENDS IT REALLY NICE
G-ccBHPfCs8_16 0 SO CHALK IS A WONDERFUL MEDIUM YOU MIGHT THINK IT'S VERY CHALKY BUT ONCE WE GET IN ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND IT BETTER YOU CAN ACTUALLY JUST TAKE YOUR FIXATIVE NOW IT'S A WORKABLE FIXATIVE AND CLEAR IT
G-ccBHPfCs8_17 0 AND YOU CAN WORK FROM THERE
G-ccBHPfCs8_18 0 SO WHEN YOU GET TO A STEP WHERE IT STARTS GETTING HARD TO PAINT SORRY THAT CHALK IN MY THROAT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S CHALK IN THIS
G-ccBHPfCs8_19 0 YOU PUT IT ON THERE YOU FIX IT THEN YOU CAN WORK ON IT AGAIN
G-ccBHPfCs8_20 0 SO HOPE YOU ENJOY THAT AND KEEP ON CHALKING AWAY
G-ccBHPfCs8_21 0 BE CAREFUL DON'T INHALE THOSE FUMES
G-ccBHPfCs8_22 0 THANK YOU SO MUCH
GiRwdx6Htlo_1 0 LET'S GO OVER THE INGREDIENTS THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO MAKE THIS DISH
GiRwdx6Htlo_2 0 WE ARE GOING TO BE NEEDING A PIECE OF CHICKEN AND I HAVE USED A THIN PIECE OF BREAST MEAT BUT THIGH MEAT WOULD ALSO BE VERY GOOD FOR THIS BECAUSE IT WOULD ADD A NICE RICH FLAVOR TO IT AND I HAVE CUT IT THIN SO THAT WE CAN BE ASSURED THAT ONCE IT IS BATTERED AND COOKED THAT IT WILL BE COOKED ALL THE WAY THROUGH
GiRwdx6Htlo_3 0 AND THAT IS WHY I DIDN'T USE THIGH ON THIS BECAUSE THAT IS A LITTLE BIT CHUNKIER AND WE WOULD HAVE TO COOK IT FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER
GiRwdx6Htlo_4 0 WE ARE GOING TO BE MINCING UP SOME GARLIC AND WE ARE ALSO GOING TO BE ADDING IN OUR JALAPENO
GiRwdx6Htlo_5 0 OUR JALAPENO IS GOING TO BE GOING IN WITH OUR CHICKEN
GiRwdx6Htlo_6 0 WE ARE GOING TO NEED A SCALLION AND WE ARE GOING TO NEED CILANTRO
GiRwdx6Htlo_7 0 WE'RE GOING TO NEED CILANTRO FOR TWO PARTS HERE THAT IS GOING TO BE GOING IN WITH OUR RICE AND THEN BECAUSE IT IS WITH OUR RICE WE ARE GOING TO CUT IT AGAIN SO WE CAN USE IT AS A GARNISH TO POUR OVER THE TOP
GiRwdx6Htlo_8 0 WE ARE GOING TO BE TAKING SOME SHITAKE MUSHROOMS AND WE ARE GOING TO BE CUTTING THEM INTO SMALL PIECES AND THEN WHEN WE DO THAT WE ARE GOING TO SOAK THEM AND THEY ARE GOING TO BECOME VERY PUNGENT BUT THAT WILL BE COUNTERACTIVE WHEN WE ADD IT IN WITH THE RICE AND OUR GINGER AND WITH A SEASONING RICE THAT IS GOING TO BE SOY SAUCE PRIMARILY
GiRwdx6Htlo_9 0 WE HAVE GOT A HALF A CUP OF RICE AND WE ARE GOING TO NEED ONE EGG WHICH WE ARE GOING TO MIX WITH CORN STARCH
GiRwdx6Htlo_10 0 WE HAVE GOT SOME BASE VEGETABLE BASE FOR OUR RICE WE ARE GOING TO NEED SOME OIL SOME GARLIC SOME RICE VINEGAR SALT AND PEPPER REGULAR WHITE VINEGAR AND SOME SOY SAUCE
gVj24uhcyZk_1 0 HI I'M HOLLY HEIDEMANN AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU TODAY HOW TO DO SOME LATERAL MOVEMENTS ON YOUR HORSE
gVj24uhcyZk_2 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO FIRST IS CALLED A SIDEPASS
gVj24uhcyZk_3 0 IT IS NOT A TRUE SIDEPASS LIKE YOU WOULD SEE YOU KNOW IN OTHER ELEMENTS OF HORSEMANSHIP
gVj24uhcyZk_4 0 FOR BARREL RACING WHAT WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS MOVE THEM AHEAD AND TO THE SIDE AT THE SAME TIME
gVj24uhcyZk_5 0 A TRUE SIDEPASS IS JUST MOVING RIGHT TO THE SIDE
gVj24uhcyZk_6 0 BUT FOR BARREL RACING COMING BETWEEN THAT FIRST AND THAT SECOND BARREL WE'VE GOT TO MOVE THEM OVER AND THIS IS THE MOVE WE USE TO DO IT
gVj24uhcyZk_7 0 SO I LIKE THEM TO MOVE A HEAD A LITTLE BIT WHILE THEY'RE MOVING TO THE SIDE
gVj24uhcyZk_8 0 IT'S NOT A TRUE SIDEPASS BUT ITS CLOSE
gVj24uhcyZk_9 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO I'M GOING TO BE SIDEPASSING TO THE RIGHT SO IF YOU'LL NOTICE I'M GOING TO LIFT UP ON MY LEFT REIN AND BARELY UNTIL I CAN SEE THAT HORSE'S LEFT EYE ON THE LEFT SIDE I JUST WANT TO BRING THAT NOSE AROUND
gVj24uhcyZk_10 0 THEN I'M GOING TO OPEN UP MY RIGHT REIN AND SO HE HAS A PLACE TO GO HE'S ALREADY WANTING TO DO IT AND I'M GOING TO SQUEEZE WITH MY LEFT LEG
gVj24uhcyZk_11 0 HORSES MOVE AWAY FROM PRESSURE SO WHEN I SQUEEZE WITH MY LEFT LEG HE'S GOING TO WANT TO MOVE TO THE RIGHT
gVj24uhcyZk_12 0 THAT MEANS I'M GOING TO HAVE TO OPEN UP MY RIGHT LEG SO THAT IT'S NOT AGAINST HIS SIDE SAYING UHN-UH
gVj24uhcyZk_13 0 WE WANT TO MAKE SURE HE HAS THAT WINDOW TO MOVE INTO
gVj24uhcyZk_14 0 SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THAT LIFT HIS LEFT SIDE USE THAT LEFT FOOT AND WE'RE GOING TO BE PUSHING HIM TO THE SIDE WHILE HE WALKS FORWARD
gVj24uhcyZk_15 0 WHAT I WANT OUT OF THIS HORSE I WANT HIM TO YIELD TO MY LEG AND GIVE ME THAT LATERAL MOVEMENT BECAUSE AS I GO BETWEEN THAT FIRST AND SECOND BARREL THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO CAUSE MY HORSE NOT TO DUCK OFF
gVj24uhcyZk_16 0 IF HE RESPECTS MY LEG I CAN MOVE HIM OVER AS FAR AS I NEED TO TO COMPLETE THAT TURN
hguPoqRhQ64_1 0 HI MY NAME IS DANIEL BALDWIN AND I'M THE GENERAL MANAGER OF KURT'S AUTO WRECKING IN AMERICAN FORK UTAH

gsM_QfT2rcQ_3 0 OKAY THIS IS A CORRECTIVE TRAINING COLLAR
gsM_QfT2rcQ_4 0 IT IS MADE OUT OF METAL OBVIOUSLY AND HAS A RING ON EACH END
gsM_QfT2rcQ_5 0 IF YOU DON'T PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THIS IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS JUST ONE WAY TO PUT IT AROUND THE DOG BUT THERE IS A RIGHT AND WRONG WAY
gsM_QfT2rcQ_6 0 FIRST YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO SLIDE THE CHAIN THROUGH ONE OF THE RINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT GOING TO FIT THIS WAY
gsM_QfT2rcQ_7 0 SAME SIZE PUT IT ON YOUR HAND HERE LET IT HANG DOWN
gsM_QfT2rcQ_8 0 THIS LOOKS LIKE A P IT HANDS DOWN ON THE LEFT SIDE THE LONG PART
gsM_QfT2rcQ_9 0 WHEN YOU TURN IT AROUND IT LOOKS LIKE A NUMBER NINE NOW
gsM_QfT2rcQ_10 0 STAYS ON THE RIGHT SIDE
gsM_QfT2rcQ_11 0 WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE DOGS HEAD LIKE A P IT IS GOING TO TIGHTEN AND LOOSEN INSTANTLY
gsM_QfT2rcQ_13 0 WHEN YOU PUT IT ON A DOG'S HOUSE LIKE A NUMBER NINE IT IS GOING TO TIGHTEN BUT IT IS NOT GOING TO LOOSEN
gsM_QfT2rcQ_14 0 YOU ARE GOING TO SAY PLEASE LOOSEN
gsM_QfT2rcQ_15 0 IT WON'T LOOSEN IT PINCHES THE DOG AND CONFUSES HIM
gHnSOjlj-o4_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS ERIC WHITE AND TODAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT FLASH FILLS
gHnSOjlj-o4_2 0 SEE OVER HERE I'VE GOT ADOBE FLASH FROM THE CREATOR SUITE THREE PROFESSIONAL VERSION AND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THESE FILLS SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS DRAW A SHAPE AND WE'LL DO THIS SQUARE AND THEN WE WILL GET OUT THE BUCKET TOOL AND COME OVER HERE AND CHOOSE A NICE COLOR FOR IT
gHnSOjlj-o4_3 0 LET'S TRY GREEN THERE WE GO
gHnSOjlj-o4_4 0 THAT'S THE WORST COLOR GREEN I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE
gHnSOjlj-o4_5 0 WE'VE GOT GREEN
gHnSOjlj-o4_6 0 LET'S SAY WE WANT TO DO A GRADIENT FILL AND CHANGE THE DIRECTION
gHnSOjlj-o4_7 0 LET'S CHANGE THE BLUE AND SLIDE IT OVER AND GET A LITTLE BIT MORE BLACK IN THERE LOOK AT THAT
gHnSOjlj-o4_8 0 THAT'S REAL NICE
gHnSOjlj-o4_9 0 LET'S SAY YOU WANTED TO FILL WITH A PICTURE SO WE ARE GOING TO IMPORT A PICTURE INTO THE LIBRARY THERE IT IS
gHnSOjlj-o4_10 0 NOW I'M GOING TO PULL THE PICTURE OUT HERE AND THEN I AM GOING TO TAKE THE EYE DROPPER TOOL AND THERE I HAVE GRABBED THE PICTURE AND NOW I'M GOING TO PASTE IT RIGHT IN HERE
gHnSOjlj-o4_11 0 NOW I GRAB THE PICTURE UP HERE SO YOU ARE JUST SEEING THE TOP PART LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN
gHnSOjlj-o4_12 0 EYE DROPPER OH I'M SORRY WE HAVE GOT TO BREAK IT FIRST SO WE BROKE IT EYE DROP IT AND FILL IT AND THERE YOU HAVE IT THAT'S HOW TO USE FILLS IN FLASH
gEMxnLl9bf0_1 0 HI A LOT OF PEOPLE CHOSE DIFFERENT TYPES OF METAL FRAMES LIKE THIS ONE RIGHT HERE IS A METAL FRAME
gEMxnLl9bf0_2 0 YOU CAN CHOOSE ANY METAL FRAME YOU WANT AS LONG AS THE BASE OF THE BED HAS A CENTER SUPPORT SYSTEM UNDERNEATH IT
gEMxnLl9bf0_3 0 THAT'S THE ONLY REQUIREMENT FOR YOUR MATTRESS THAT IT HAS A CENTER SUPPORT ON A QUEEN AND A KING SIZE MATTRESS
gEMxnLl9bf0_4 0 BUT THIS IS NOT GOING TO OFFER ANY EXTRA COMFORT OR IT'S NOT GOING TO HURT YOUR MATTRESS AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THE ADEQUATE SUPPORT UNDERNEATH IT
gEMxnLl9bf0_5 0 I'VE HEARD THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO LEAVE THE PLASTIC ON THEIR MATTRESS IT'S REALLY NOT A GOOD IDEA
gEMxnLl9bf0_6 0 THE MATTRESS IS DESIGNED TO WORK WITHOUT THE PLASTIC IT DOES KEEP YOUR BED CLEAN SOMETIMES BUT YOUR BED AND THE MATERIALS IN IT NEED TO BREATH
gEMxnLl9bf0_7 0 SO IT CAN CAUSE CONDENSATION TO GET INTO YOUR BEDS SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU TAKE THE PLASTIC OFF
gEMxnLl9bf0_8 0 HOWEVER THE MATTRESS INDUSTRY HAS COME UP WITH A NEW MATTRESS PAD THAT BREATHES BUT IT ALSO DOES NOT LET ANY LIQUID GO THROUGH TO THE MATTRESS AT ALL
gEMxnLl9bf0_9 0 IT ALSO PROTECTS THE BED FROM DUST MITES
gEMxnLl9bf0_10 0 AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
gEMxnLl9bf0_11 0 SO IT'S IT HAS ENOUGH ROOM IN IT SO THAT IT CAN BREATHE AND LET THE MATTRESS BREATHE UNDERNEATH IT BUT THEN AGAIN IT DOESN'T LET WATER THROUGH OR ANY LIQUID OR DUST MITES SO THIS OR EITHER YOUR BODY SWEAT OR ANY THING LIKE THAT
gEMxnLl9bf0_12 0 SO A GOOD MATTRESS PAD IS REALLY WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
gEMxnLl9bf0_13 0 YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR KEEPING THE PLASTIC ON IT
gMoqAzB3ODY_2 0 MY NAME IS KIP AND I AM HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gMoqAzB3ODY_3 0 TODAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BUILDING TROUBLESHOOTING AND REPAIRING YOUR OWN AUDIO CABLES MICROPHONE CABLES AND ETC
gMoqAzB3ODY_4 0 THE FIRST THING WE ARE GOING TO DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT THE TOOLS THAT YOU WILL NEED TO DO THIS WORK
gMoqAzB3ODY_5 0 YOU WILL NEED A SOLDERING IRON
gMoqAzB3ODY_6 0 IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DO LOTS AND LOTS OF YOUR OWN WORK YOU CAN GET ONE THAT DOES NOT HAVE THIS POWER BASE AND IT IS JUST A HANDLE LIKE THIS
gMoqAzB3ODY_7 0 YOU CAN GET THEM WITH VARIABLE HEAT CONTROL KNOB HERE OR WITHOUT BUT YOU WANT TO GET A DECENT QUALITY ONE THAT WILL DO THIS WORK
gMoqAzB3ODY_8 0 HAVING VARIABLE TEMPERATURE CONTROL IN THIS WORKSTATION MAKES ONE A NICE PLACE TO PUT YOUR SOLDERING IRON WHEN IT IS HOT AND TWO YOU CAN CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE VERY PRECISELY FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORK
gMoqAzB3ODY_9 0 FOR MAKING AUDIO CONNECTIONS IT IS NOT NEAR AS IMPORTANT TO HAVE VERY PRECISE CONTROL OVER HEAT AS IT WOULD BE IF YOU WERE WORKING ON CIRCUITS BOARDS WHERE OVERHEATING A COMPONENT CAN DAMAGE IT QUITE EASILY
gMoqAzB3ODY_10 0 YOU WILL NEED A MOISTENED SPONGE
gMoqAzB3ODY_11 0 THE MOISTENED SPONGE WE USE TO CLEAN THE TIP OF OUR SOLDERING IRON
gMoqAzB3ODY_12 0 YOU WILL NEED SOME WIRE CUTTERS YOU WILL RESIN CORDE SOLDER AND SOME FORM OF WIRE STRIPPERS
gMoqAzB3ODY_13 0 THIS HAS A CRIMPER AND EVERYTHING INVOLVED BUT THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD USE AS THE WIRE STRIPPER
gMoqAzB3ODY_14 0 IT IS NICE TO HAVE SOME WAY TO REMOVE THE SOLDER FROM THE OLD JOINT
gMoqAzB3ODY_15 0 THIS IS A SUCKING TYPE SOLDERING REMOVING PROCESS OR WE HAVE THIS BRAIDED TYPE
gMoqAzB3ODY_16 0 ANOTHER TOOL THAT I BUILT MYSELF WOULD BE THIS CLAMP WHEREAS YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A CLAMP LIKE THIS AND IT IS VERY SIMPLE CLAMP
gMoqAzB3ODY_17 0 I PUT A COUPLE OF PIECES OF WEATHER STRIPPING AND I PUT PIECES OF METAL AND SOME SPRINGS AND THIS IS THE FIRST ONE I BUILT
gMoqAzB3ODY_18 0 I HAVE A BETTER ONE THAT I KEEP IN MY CASE THAT HAS STIFFER SPRINGS
gMoqAzB3ODY_19 0 IT IS NICE TO BE ABLE TO HOLD YOUR CONNECTOR WHILE YOU WORK ON IT AND ONE SIZE FITS ALL THIS WAY
gMoqAzB3ODY_20 0 OTHER THAN THE WIRES AND THE CONNECTORS THESE ARE ALL THE TOOLS THAT YOU WILL NEED TO GET STARTED BUILDING YOUR OWN AUDIO CABLES AND REPAIRING THEM
G6OvjQrDwQc_1 0 THERE ARE QUITE A FEW MATERIALS NEEDED FOR THIS PROJECT BUT YOU'LL FIND THAT MOST OF THEM YOU PROBABLY HAVE IN YOUR HOUSE ALREADY
G6OvjQrDwQc_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO NEED PIPE CLEANERS
G6OvjQrDwQc_3 0 WE'RE ALSO GOING TO NEED NEWSPAPER AND NEWSPAPER STRIPS
G6OvjQrDwQc_4 0 WE'RE GOING TO USE A CHEESE CLOTH WHICH CAN BE FOUND AT YOUR HARDWARE STORE
G6OvjQrDwQc_5 0 SOMETIMES NOT SO MUCH YOUR ARTS SUPPLY STORE BUT A HARDWARE STORE IS THE BEST PLACE TO FIND THAT
G6OvjQrDwQc_6 0 WE'RE ALSO GOING TO NEED A BUCKET FOR MIXING YOUR PAPER MACHE
G6OvjQrDwQc_7 0 FOR PAPER MACHE I LIKE TO USE SALT FLOUR AND SOME WATER
G6OvjQrDwQc_8 0 FOR DECORATING OUR LIZARD WE'RE GOING TO USE ACRYLIC PAINT SOME TEMPERA GLITTER PAINT AND WE'LL ALSO BE USING SOME SEQUINS AND SOME GOOGLIE EYES
G6OvjQrDwQc_9 0 MOST OF THESE THINGS YOU CAN FIND EITHER IN YOUR HOUSE LIKE THE FLOUR THE SALT WATER NEWSPAPER
G6OvjQrDwQc_10 0 PIPE CLEANERS PAINTS SEQUINS AND THINGS LIKE THAT YOU CAN FIND AT YOUR ART SUPPLY STORE
G6OvjQrDwQc_11 0 YOU'LL ALSO WANT TO HAVE SOME WATER HANDY SO THAT YOU CAN WASH OUT YOUR BRUSHES SOME GLUE AND POSSIBLY SOME SCISSORS
hggwnRvbp4E_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS LUIS ESTRADA AND I'M A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER
hggwnRvbp4E_2 0 IN THIS VIDEO I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO SHOP ONLINE SECURELY
hggwnRvbp4E_3 0 THERE ARE MANY FEATURES THAT WEB BROWSERS HAVE TO INCREASE YOUR SECURITY FOR SHOPPING ONLINE
hggwnRvbp4E_4 0 FOR THIS EXAMPLE I WILL USE TWO FEATURES THAT INTERNET EXPLORER HAS
hggwnRvbp4E_5 0 INTERNET EXPLORER IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF MICROSOFT A COMPANY TO WHICH I HAVE NO AFFILIATION
hggwnRvbp4E_6 0 THE FIRST FEATURE IS THE PHISHING FILTER
hggwnRvbp4E_7 0 PHISHING IS A FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY WHEN SOMEONE TRIES TO GET SENSITIVE INFORMATION FROM YOU BY PRETENDING TO BE SOMEONE THEY'RE NOT
hggwnRvbp4E_8 0 THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT CRIMINALS TRY TO GET INCLUDE USER NAMES PASSWORDS CREDIT CARD BANK ACCOUNT OR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS
hggwnRvbp4E_9 0 ONE OF THE STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY IS TO ENABLE THE PHISHING FILTER BY CLICKING TOOLS ENABLE PHISHING FILTER
hggwnRvbp4E_10 0 WHAT YOUR WEB BROWSER WILL DO IS SET THE ADDRESS OF WEBSITES YOU VISIT AND COMPARE THEM AGAINST A LIST OF SITES KNOWN FOR STEALING USER INFORMATION VIA PHISHING ACTIVITIES
hggwnRvbp4E_11 0 IF THE WEBSITE YOU ARE VISITING IS INCLUDED IN THAT LIST INTERNET EXPLORER WILL DISPLAY A WARNING
hggwnRvbp4E_12 0 THE SECOND FEATURE THAT ALL WEB BROWSERS HAVE IS THE USE OF ENCRYPTED CONNECTIONS
hggwnRvbp4E_13 0 WHENEVER YOU VISIT A WEBSITE THAT INSTEAD OF USING THE HTTP COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL USES HTTPS
hggwnRvbp4E_14 0 THE INFORMATION THAT YOU SENT TO THAT WEBSITE IS PROTECTED BY ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM
hggwnRvbp4E_15 0 THAT WAY ONLY THAT WEBSITE IS ABLE TO READ YOUR INFORMATION
hggwnRvbp4E_16 0 TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT WHEN YOU SEND YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION FOR EXAMPLE THIS INFORMATION COULD TRAVEL ALL AROUND THE WORLD BEFORE IT REACHES ITS DESTINATION
hggwnRvbp4E_17 0 IF ALONG THE WAY THERE WERE SOME COMPUTER PROGRAM TO STEAL THIS INFORMATION YOU COULD BE AN EASY PREY IF YOUR DATA IS NOT ENCRYPTED BECAUSE IT WOULD TRAVEL AS PLAIN TEXT
hggwnRvbp4E_18 0 EVERY WEBSITE THAT IMPLEMENTS AN ENCRYPTED CONNECTION MUST ACQUIRE A SECURITY CERTIFICATE
hggwnRvbp4E_19 0 TO VALIDATE THE AUTHENTICITY OF THIS CERTIFICATE JUST CLICK ON THE LOCK AT THE RIGHT OF THE ADDRESS BAR THEN SELECT VIEW CERTIFICATES AND YOU WILL SEE THIS IS A VALID CERTIFICATE
hggwnRvbp4E_20 0 NEVER SEND CREDIT CARD INFORMATION THROUGH A WEBSITE THAT DOES NOT USE AN ENCRYPTED CONNECTION OR WHOSE CERTIFICATE APPEARS TO BE INVALID
hggwnRvbp4E_21 0 I'M LUIS ESTRADA AND I'VE JUST SHOWN YOU HOW TO USE YOUR WEB BROWSER
HINaX_z0mHU_1 0 HEY GUYS WHAT'S UP
HINaX_z0mHU_2 0 THIS IS JACOB FROM THE KATE BARN SKATEBOARD PARK IN HAMSTEAD NORTH CAROLINA
HINaX_z0mHU_3 0 TODAY WE ARE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO DO A MANUAL ON A SKATEBOARD
HINaX_z0mHU_4 0 A MANUAL ALSO CALLED A WHEELIE IS WHEN YOU BALANCE ON YOUR BACK TWO WHEELS ALONE PROVIDING EQUAL AMOUNT OF PRESSURE TO THE TAIL IN THE CENTER OF YOUR BOARD THEREFORE YOU DO NOT WANT TO SCRAPE YOUR TAIL OR LET YOUR FRONT WHEELS HIT
HINaX_z0mHU_5 0 MANUALS TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO GET USED TO
HINaX_z0mHU_6 0 YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN WHERE TO PLACE YOUR FEET ON THE BOARD AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN THE PROPER SPEED AND YOU NEED TO KNOW THE NICE FLAT SMOOTH SURFACE TO TRY IT ON
HINaX_z0mHU_7 0 HERE WE GO
HINaX_z0mHU_8 0 I'LL NOW DEMONSTRATE THE MANUAL
HINaX_z0mHU_9 0 WITH ONE STEADY PUSH AND THE PROPER FOOT PLACEMENT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO MANUAL
HINaX_z0mHU_10 0 ONCE YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH DOING A MANUAL THERE ARE SEVERAL VARIATIONS THAT YOU CAN DO
HINaX_z0mHU_11 0 YOU CAN OLLIE ON TO A SIDE WALK AND MANUAL YOU CAN DO A 180 INTO A MANUAL A KICK FLIP INTO A MANUAL OR START REALLY BASIC AND LEARN HOW TO DO A NOSE MANUAL
HINaX_z0mHU_12 0 I WILL NOW DEMONSTRATE A NOSE MANUAL
HINaX_z0mHU_13 0 ONCE AGAIN WE ARE GOING TO BALANCE THE WEIGHT ON THE NOSE THIS TIME JUST ENOUGH NOT TO SCRAPE THE NOSE OR TO LET THE BACK WHEELS TOUCH THE GROUND
HINaX_z0mHU_14 0 HERE IS A NOSE MANUAL
HINaX_z0mHU_15 0 THAT'S HOW YOU DO A MANUAL IN SKATEBOARDING
GAP9uRYfTLk_1 0 THE NEXT KNOT WE'RE GOING TO TIE IS THE LARKSHEAD
GAP9uRYfTLk_2 0 MANY OF US MIGHT KNOW THIS KNOT AS WELL
GAP9uRYfTLk_3 0 IT TENDS TO BE A FAIRLY NATURAL KNOT TO TIE WHEN WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE SOMETHING WORK
GAP9uRYfTLk_4 0 YOU START BY FOLDING THE ROPE IN HALF AND YOU CAN TAKE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO TIE IT AROUND
GAP9uRYfTLk_5 0 IT'S OFTEN TIED AROUND A HOOK OR A HOOP AND THEN YOU TAKE THE TWO ENDS OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE ROPE SLIDE THEM THROUGH THE LOOP AND GO LIKE SO
GAP9uRYfTLk_6 0 THE LARKSHEAD KNOT ISN'T ALWAYS THE MOST STABLE KNOT BUT A WAY YOU CAN MAKE IT MORE STABLE IS SIMPLY BY PASSING ONE END OF THE ROPE THROUGH IT AGAIN AND THIS KIND OF MAKES IT FIND UP A LITTLE BIT WHICH CAN ALSO BE MORE DIFFICULT TO UNTIE BUT IT'S A LOT MORE STABLE
GfQLBy4gfTM_1 0 NOW THAT WE GOT IT THIS FAR WE CAN GO BACK AND CLEAN IT UP ON THE INSIDE PUSHING DOWN ALL THE WHILE
GfQLBy4gfTM_2 0 YOU MIGHT THINK IT LOOKS LIKE A BOWL BUT I'M NOT DONE YET
GfQLBy4gfTM_3 0 KEEP ON PUSHING DOWN
GfQLBy4gfTM_4 0 IT'S ALL RIGHT
GfQLBy4gfTM_5 0 THERE WE GO
GfQLBy4gfTM_6 0 ALRIGHT I WANT TO CHECK IT
GfQLBy4gfTM_7 0 AT THIS POINT I LIKE TO TAKE MY POTTER'S KNIFE AND MAKE IT REAL DRY DOWN THERE TO SCRAPE OFF ALL THE GOO SCRAPE OFF ALL THE EXTRA CLAY
GfQLBy4gfTM_8 0 JUST DRY IT UP BECAUSE THE DRYER THIS CLAY IS THE BETTER OFF YOU'RE GOING TO BE WHEN IT COMES TO THIS NEXT MOVE WE'RE GOING TO DO WHERE I'M GOING TO MAKE A RIM AND IT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THIS THING MAKES IT THROUGH THE FIRING PROCESS WITHOUT WARPING AND ALL THE COMPRESSION THAT WE DID IS GOING TO MAKE SURE WE GET THROUGH THE FIRING PROCESS WITHOUT CRACKING
gVFBabbrWxM_1 0 ONE OF THE TRICKS THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO LEARN BEFORE DOING THE FAKIE OLLIE DISASTER IS YOU'LL NEED TO KNOW HOW IT FEELS TO HAVE YOUR BACK WHEELS ABOVE THE TRANSITION AND ABLE TO GET OUT FROM THIS POSITION
gVFBabbrWxM_2 0 IT'S EASY TO GET IN TO THIS POSITION BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS BY ROLLING BACKWARDS WITH TOO MUCH SPEED AND YOU END UP LOCKING OVER
gVFBabbrWxM_3 0 BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IS BE ABLE TO PUT WEIGHT ON THE FRONT OF YOUR BOARD OR YOUR NOSE AND ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PURPOSEFULLY PICK UP THE BACK WHEELS AND CLEAR THE COPING AND BE ABLE TO ROLL BACK DOWN THE TRANSITION AND HAVE CONTROL
gVFBabbrWxM_4 0 SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS ROLL BACKWARDS UP THE QUARTER PIPE OR MINI-RAMP THAT YOU'RE SKATING AND LET YOUR BACK WHEELS ROLL ON TOP
gVFBabbrWxM_5 0 AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE LOCKED IN THIS POSITION IT'S BEST TO LOCK BECAUSE THAT WAY YOU DON'T YOU'RE NOT TEETERING LOCK WITH YOUR WHEELS AGAINST THE COPING
gVFBabbrWxM_6 0 AND THEN PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR NOSE AND LET THE BACK WHEELS PICK UP PAST THE COPING AND CLEAR IT COMPLETELY AND THEN ROLL DOWN THE TRANSITION
gVFBabbrWxM_7 0 THIS LEARNING THIS MOTION WILL GET YOU SET UP SO THAT WHEN YOU DO A BIG OLLIE OR CRACK THE FAKIE DISASTER AND U LAND YOU'LL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'LL NEED TO DO WHEN YOU ROLL BACK IN AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE TRICKS YOU'LL NEED TO DO BEFORE DOING FAKIE OLLIE DISASTER
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_1 0 HI I'M LUCY SPAIN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE HERE TO TALK ABOUT CHEERLEADING JUMPS AND TUMBLING
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_2 0 ONE OF THE MOST BASIC TUMBLES WE CAN START WITH IS A CARTWHEEL
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_3 0 NOW A CARTWHEEL IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S A BASE FUNDAMENTAL TO BUILD ON AND GET YOUR CONFIDENCE SET FOR DOING ANY SORT OF TUMBLE AT ALL
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_4 0 IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOU KEEP YOUR ARMS AT A LOCKED POSITION AT ALL TIMES WHEN YOU'RE ON THE GROUND
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_5 0 ANOTHER VARIATION OF THE CARTWHEEL IS A ROUND OFF
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_6 0 NOW THE ROUND OFF IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE CARTWHEEL EXCEPT FOR WE HAVE A TORSO TURN AND INSTEAD OF OUR LEGS HITTING THE FLOOR ONE BY ONE OUR LEGS WILL HIT THE FLOOR TOGETHER
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_7 0 NOW WHEN STARTING A CARTWHEEL THE BEST WAY TO LEARN IS BY TAPING A LINE OF MASKING TAPE ACROSS THE FLOOR THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_8 0 ONCE YOU HAVE THAT MASKING TAPE SET YOU CAN PUT YOUR TOE ON THE LINE TO START
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_9 0 NOW THE FIRST THING THAT'S GOING TO HIT THE FLOOR IS GOING TO BE YOUR FIRST HAND
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_10 0 NOW IF YOU'RE RIGHT HANDED THAT'S GOING TO BE YOUR RIGHT HAND
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_11 0 IF YOU'RE LEFT HANDED YOU SIMPLY TAKE THE OTHER END OF THE LINE AND YOU'RE GOING TO GO WITH YOUR LEFT HAND
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_12 0 IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW TO DO BOTH SIDES BECAUSE YOU MAY BE ASKED TO COME FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_13 0 SO ONCE WE HAVE SET OURSELVES WE'RE GOING TO RAISE OUR RIGHT HAND OR LEFT HAND WHICHEVER IS GOING TO BE YOUR FIRST TO HIT THE FLOOR YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE IT LANDS ON THE TAPE ONE HAND TWO HAND FOOT FOOT
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_14 0 AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO FOR THE CARTWHEEL
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_15 0 NOW ONCE YOU GET YOUR BASIC MASTERED YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SPEED IT UP A LITTLE BIT SO YOU CAN GET SOME MOMENTUM BUILDING
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_16 0 NOW THE ROUND OFF IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE CARTWHEEL
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_17 0 YOU'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO START WITH THE SAME PREPARATION AND IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME MIDDLE FORM
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_18 0 THE ONLY THING IS ONCE WE'RE IN THE AIR AND WE HAVE BOTH FEET UP WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO MEET THEM TOGETHER AND DROP THEM TOGETHER SO THEY'RE TOUCHING WHEN YOU HIT THE GROUND
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_19 0 NOW THE ROUND OFF IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT TUMBLE IN CHEERLEADING BECAUSE THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO START ALL OF OUR RUNNING TUMBLING PASSAGES
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_20 0 NOW IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO PRACTICE YOUR ROUND OFF WITH SPEED AND POWER AND HEIGHT
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_21 0 SO USUALLY YOU WANT TO GET AS MUCH OF A RUNNING START AS POSSIBLE
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_22 0 YOU REALLY WANT TO GO AS FAST AS YOU CAN INTO THAT TUMBLE GET A LOT OF POWER GOING AND REALLY SNAP OUT OF IT AND FROM HERE AT THE END OF OUR ROUND OFF IS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO DO ALL OF OUR BACK FLIPS BACK HANDSPRINGS AND FULLS
HHwBA2f1lGs_1 0 IT IS IMPORTANT JUST LIKE IT WAS WITH THE PAPER MACHE TO LET OUR LIZARD DRY
HHwBA2f1lGs_2 0 LET THE PAINT DRY AND THE GLUE DRY
HHwBA2f1lGs_3 0 SINCE WE USED A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAINT
HHwBA2f1lGs_4 0 WE HAVE THE ACRYLIC WHICH DRIES PRETTY QUICKLY AND THEN THE TEMPRA GLITTER WHICH TAKES A LITTLE BIT LONGER SO I THINK IT IS BEST TO LEAVE IT IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA PROBABLY THE SAME PLACE WHERE YOU LEFT IT TO DO THE PAPER MACHE DRYING PROCESS
HHwBA2f1lGs_5 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HE IS ON A SURFACE THAT CAN BE PULLED UP EASILY
HHwBA2f1lGs_6 0 IF YOU PUT HIM ON A NEWSPAPER TO DRY WITH THIS KIND OF PAINT WITH THE ACRYLIC PAINT WHEN YOU LIFT HIM UP HE IS GOING TO HAVE PIECES OF THAT NEWSPAPER STUCK IT HIM AND IT IS ONLY GOING TO CREATE MORE OF A PROCESS FOR GOING BACK AND CLEANING UP AND REPAINTING AND PAINTING OVER
HHwBA2f1lGs_7 0 IF YOU NEED TO DO A COUPLE OF COATS OF PAINT ON YOUR LIZARD YOU CAN DO THAT LET IT DRY COME BACK AND THEN PAINT IT OVER AGAIN
HHwBA2f1lGs_8 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU'VE APPLIED A FACE ON YOUR LIZARD THAT THE GLUE IS DRY BEFORE HANGING HIM OR DISPLAYING HIM THOSE SEQUINS IN THE GOOGLEY EYE CAN TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO DRY
GNKJATaBTwI_1 0 OK SO NOW I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO GET GIGS
GNKJATaBTwI_2 0 WHEN YOU'RE FIRST STARTING FACE PAINTING THE BEST THING TO DO IS JUST GET YOUR NAME OUT THERE
GNKJATaBTwI_3 0 I'VE DONE ALL SORTS OF THINGS FROM ASKING RESTAURANT MANAGERS IF I CAN COME IN DURING A KID'S SPECIAL HOUR AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S TONS OF KIDS AND YOU CAN SET UP A BOOTH AND HAVE YOURSELF THERE
GNKJATaBTwI_4 0 SET UP SOME CARDS THAT YOU CAN GET FOR YOURSELF JUST WITH YOUR EMAIL AND NAME ON THEM OR PHONE NUMBER AND JUST START GETTING YOUR NAME OUT THERE
GNKJATaBTwI_5 0 DO THE KIDS AT THE RESTAURANTS
GNKJATaBTwI_6 0 THE PARENTS GET EXCITED
GNKJATaBTwI_7 0 THEY TIP YOU AND THINGS JUST KIND OF SNOWBALL EFFECT FROM THERE
GNKJATaBTwI_8 0 THAT'S HOW IT KIND OF WORKED FOR ME BUT ALSO THERE'S MILLIONS OF THINGS YOU CAN DO SUCH AS FESTIVALS BIRTHDAY PARTIES AND SLOWLY ONCE YOUR NAME DOES START LEAKING OUT THERE IT REALLY STARTS PICKING UP BUT TO GET YOUR NAME OUT THERE I SUGGEST YOU GET YOURSELF A WEBSITE IF YOU REALLY LIKE THE STUFF THAT YOU DO AND YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF PICTURES TO UPLOAD
GNKJATaBTwI_9 0 START UP ON IT

-ghc0pf6KO0_1 0 HI TOM CHOISNET ENROLLED AGENT AGAIN
-ghc0pf6KO0_2 0 I WANTED TO ADD A LITTLE MORE ON THE BUSINESS GIFT
-ghc0pf6KO0_3 0 WE TALKED ABOUT EMPLOYMENT ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS AND I WANTED TO BREAK OUT A SEPARATE SECTION BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO BE A LITTLE LOOP AS TO THE BUSINESS GIFT RULES
-ghc0pf6KO0_4 0 SO I MADE SOME NOTES HERE THAT I'M GOING TO REFER TO
-ghc0pf6KO0_5 0 EMPLOYMENT ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS HAVE TO DO WITH LENGTH OF SERVICE OR SAFETY AWARDS
-ghc0pf6KO0_6 0 THEY CANNOT DISCRIMINATE TO HIGHLY COMPENSATED- MUCH AS MANY OF THE PENSION RULES AND IT REQUIRES A MINIMUM OF FIVE YEARS SERVICE FOR THEM TO QUALIFY
-ghc0pf6KO0_7 0 AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT THE AVERAGE OF SUCH AWARDS CANNOT EXCEED FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS
-ghc0pf6KO0_8 0 SO IT'S JUST A LITTLE LOOPHOLE THAT CAN HELP GET AROUND THAT TWENTY-FIVE DOLLAR PER DONEE ON THE BUSINESS GIFT
-ghc0pf6KO0_9 0 SO I HOPE THAT'S HELPFUL AND TAKE A LITTLE LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER SEGMENTS WE HAVE
-ghc0pf6KO0_10 0 YOU'LL ENJOY THE CLIPS
GptTbkqR50E_1 0 OK THIS IS A GAME AND YOU CAN CALL IT DON'T SAY THAT OR YOU CAN CALL IT THE NECKLACE GAME THE BELL GAME BUT I LIKE TO CALL IT DON'T SAY THAT
GptTbkqR50E_2 0 IT'S A GREAT NAME FOR THE GAME AND EVERYBODY WHO COMES IN IS GOING TO GET SOME SORT OF A NECKLACE OR A PIN YOU CAN USE A LEI YOU CAN USE A STRAND OF BEADS ANOTHER GREAT WAY IS TO GIVE EVERYBODY A LITTLE NECKLACE WITH A BELL ON THE END ANYTHING LIKE THAT IS GOING TO WORK
GptTbkqR50E_3 0 YOU CAN MAKE LITTLE PINS TO PUT ON THEY'RE WEDDING DRESS PINS JUST ANYTHING YOU WANT THAT SOMEBODY CAN ACTUALLY WEAR AND THAT'S VISIBLE AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE ALL YOUR GUESTS A LIST OF WORDS THAT THEY CAN'T SAY
GptTbkqR50E_4 0 FOR INSTANCE THEY CAN'T SAY BRIDE THEY HAVE TO CALL THE BRIDE ONLY BY HER NAME THE CAN'T SAY GROOM THEY CAN ONLY SAY THE GROOM'S NAME AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS AS YOUR GUESTS HEAR OTHER GUESTS SAY THOSE WORDS THEY CAN'T SAY LIKE BRIDE OR GROOM THEY GET TO TAKE WHATEVER NECKLACE THEY'RE WEARING
GptTbkqR50E_5 0 NOW THIS CONTINUES ON THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BRIDAL SHOWER AND EVEN IF YOU LOSE YOUR NECKLACE YOU CAN CATCH OTHER PEOPLE SAYING IT AND TAKE ONE OF THEIRS
GptTbkqR50E_6 0 AT THE END OF THE BRIDAL SHOWER THE PERSON WHO HAS THE MOST NECKLACES OR PINS WHATEVER YOU'RE USING IS GOING TO BE THE WINNER OF THAT GAME AND THEY'RE GOING TO GET A PRIZE
GptTbkqR50E_7 0 AND IT'S REALLY FUNNY BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH PEOPLE SAYING BRIDE AND GROOM AND SAY OH WHY'D I DO THAT AND IT'S FUNNY EVERYBODY GETS TO LAUGH AND THEY GET TO STEAL NECKLACES FROM EACH OTHER
GptTbkqR50E_8 0 SO AGAIN IT GETS YOUR GUESTS INVOLVED IT GETS THEM MINGLING AND EVERYBODY'S GOING TO LAUGH AT HOW MANY TIMES THEY FORGET WHAT WORDS THEY CAN'T SAY
GptTbkqR50E_9 0 SO THAT'S A GREAT GAME TO GET EVERYONE INVOLVED AND IT'S THE DON'T SAY THAT GAME FOR YOUR BRIDAL SHOWER
H0jb2CW_CNI_1 0 THIS IS CHRISTOPHER LYMAN WITH EXPERTVILLAGE.COM AND THE NEXT THING WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS SOAP
H0jb2CW_CNI_2 0 WHAT I LIKE TO USE AND WHAT MOST PROFESSIONAL WINDOW WASHERS USE IS SOME FORM OF DISH SOAP
H0jb2CW_CNI_3 0 I LIKE LEMON JOY
H0jb2CW_CNI_4 0 THIS IS IN THE HIGHLY CONCENTRATED FORM
H0jb2CW_CNI_5 0 SO YOU WON'T NEED AS MUCH SOAP AS YOU WOULD USE TO WASH YOUR DISHES
H0jb2CW_CNI_6 0 IF YOU'VE GOT THIS BUCKET HALFWAY FULL A FEW DROPS IS MORE THAN ENOUGH
H0jb2CW_CNI_7 0 IF YOU USE TOO MUCH YOUR WINDOWS ARE GOING TO STREAK SO YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL ON HOW MUCH SOAP YOU USE
H0jb2CW_CNI_8 0 AND I'VE ALSO BEEN TOLD IF YOU USE ANTI-BACTERIAL SOAP IT WILL CAUSE YOUR WINDOWS TO STREAK SO AVOID ANTI-BACTERIAL SOAP
H0jb2CW_CNI_9 0 AND WE ARE GOING TO BE WASHING WINDOWS OUTSIDE TODAY
H0jb2CW_CNI_10 0 HERE IN UTAH IT IS TWENTY DEGREES OUTSIDE CURRENTLY SO WHAT I AM USING IS WINDSHIELD WASH DE-ICER AND DEPENDING ON HOW COLD IT IS YOU CAN MIX THIS WITH WATER BUT SOMETIMES I USE IT STRAIGHT SO THAT YOUR WATER DOESN'T FREEZE UP ON THE GLASS
H0jb2CW_CNI_11 0 I'VE ALSO HEARD OF PEOPLE USING STUFF THAT THEY PUT IN SEPTIC TANKS
H0jb2CW_CNI_12 0 THAT WORKS JUST AS WELL
GfRDA2uAIPw_1 0 SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE A BUSY INDIVIDUAL AND YOU WANT TO HAVE A HEALTHY DIET SO SCHEDULE YOUR HEALTH END
GfRDA2uAIPw_2 0 SO MANY TIMES PEOPLE SAY TO ME BRENDA I'M JUST SO BUSY I DIDN'T GET MY WORK OUT IN OR I'M SO BUSY THAT I DIDN'T GET TO THE GROCERY STORE AND I COULDN'T BUY ALL THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT I NEEDED FOR THE WEEK
GfRDA2uAIPw_3 0 SO MY SUGGESTION IS THAT YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR HEALTH AS A CLIENT AND IF YOU'RE A BUSY INDIVIDUAL YOU PROBABLY HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS A DAY PLANNER
GfRDA2uAIPw_4 0 OR YOU MIGHT HAVE A PALM PILOT OR SOME SORT OF PHONE THAT YOU'RE SCHEDULING ALL YOUR ACTIVITIES IN
GfRDA2uAIPw_5 0 WHETHER YOU HAVE ASSIGNMENTS TO TURN IN OR CLIENTS TO VISIT GO AHEAD AND SCHEDULE YOURSELF IN AT LEAST THIRTY MINUTES FOR LUNCH
GfRDA2uAIPw_6 0 GIVE YOURSELF SOME TIME TO EAT AND YOU ARE NOT SCARFING DOWN ANYTHING SCHEDULE YOUR SHOPPING TRIPS IN SCHEDULE YOUR WATER WHENEVER YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET ENOUGH WATER IN
GfRDA2uAIPw_7 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE SCHEDULING YOUR EXERCISE BECAUSE IF YOU ARE A BUSY INDIVIDUAL YOU NEED SOME SORT OF OUTLET AND IF YOU ARE EXERCISING MORE THAN LIKELY YOUR DIETS ARE GOING TO IMPROVE
GfRDA2uAIPw_8 0 SO DON'T FORGET TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SCHEDULE IN YOUR HEALTH AS A CLIENTS
hJD_vHdFwYs_2 0 I'M DR ADRIENNE MULLIGAN AND I AM THE OWNER OF CAMP VERDE VETERINARY CLINIC AND I AM HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM AND I AM HERE TO TALK ABOUT CAT GROOMING
hJD_vHdFwYs_3 0 OKAY ON THE SAME DAY YOU ARE DOING ALL YOUR GROOMING AND TAKING THE WHOLE DAY AND SPENDING IT ON YOUR KITTY SPA THE NEXT THING TO DEAL WITH IS GOOD DENTAL HYGIENE AND THIS IS A ENZYMATIC TOOTHPASTE FOR DOGS AND CATS
hJD_vHdFwYs_4 0 IT HAS A FLAVOR THIS ONE IS POULTRY FLAVORED
hJD_vHdFwYs_5 0 SOME ARE FISH FLAVORED DEPENDING ON WHAT YOUR CAT LIKES AND THIS IS JUST A LITTLE SAMPLE AND THIS IS MY FAVORITE THING
hJD_vHdFwYs_6 0 IT IS JUST A TOOTHBRUSH THAT GOES ON YOUR FINGER AND THEN YOU JUST PUT THIS TOOTHPASTE ON THERE AND THEN I AM HOLDING HER KIND OF IN MY ARMS AND JUST LIFTING HER UPPER LIP AND HER LOWER LIP
hJD_vHdFwYs_7 0 I KNOW AND I AM GETTING IN THERE AND SHE CAN LICK SOME OF IT BECAUSE SHE KIND OF LIKES IT
hJD_vHdFwYs_8 0 I'M JUST WORKING ON I KNOW THERE YOU GO
hJD_vHdFwYs_9 0 I KNOW YOU ARE OKAY
hJD_vHdFwYs_10 0 I'M NOT HURTING YOU
hJD_vHdFwYs_11 0 THERE YOU GO AND BASICALLY JUST REALLY WORKING ON THE OUTSIDES BECAUSE THE ENZYME IN IT IS GOING TO DO MOST OF THE WORK AND A LITTLE BIT OF BRUSHING YOU CAN GET IT IN THERE
hJD_vHdFwYs_12 0 IT'S JUST GOING TO BE THAT MUCH BETTER FOR THEM
hJD_vHdFwYs_13 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THE INSIDE TOO MUCH
hJD_vHdFwYs_14 0 MOST OF THEIR TARTAR BUILDS UP ON THE OUTSIDE OF THEIR TEETH AND IF YOU CAN GET THAT YOU ARE DOING PRETTY GOOD
hjCSXj24vt8_1 0 LET'S TALK ABOUT TRIMMING YOUR DOG'S NAILS
hjCSXj24vt8_2 0 BE VERY CAREFUL WITH TRIMMING NAILS
hjCSXj24vt8_3 0 NAILS ARE VERY TENDER THERE IS A QUICK WHICH BLEEDS IN THERE IF YOU GET TO FAR OR TOO CLOSE TO IT AND ALSO PETS AND DOGS CAN BITE IF THEY'RE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE OR FEEL PAIN
hjCSXj24vt8_4 0 SO JUST ALWAYS BE VERY CAREFUL
hjCSXj24vt8_5 0 THE NEXT STEP IS TO DETERMINE THE NAIL LENGTH AND SOME NAILS ARE BLACK SOME NAILS ARE CLEAR WHICH MAKES IT A LITTLE EASIER TO IDENTIFY THE QUICK OR THE RED PART INSIDE THE NAIL
hjCSXj24vt8_6 0 NEXT YOU WANT TO IDENTIFY THE NAIL THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TRIM AND PRESS IT OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT SO IT SEPARATES FROM THE OTHER NAILS AND YOU WANT TO VISUALLY IF YOU CAN SEE THE QUICK GO AWAY FROM IT ON THIS SIDE
hjCSXj24vt8_7 0 BE DELIBERATE AND QUICK USE SHARP AND FAIRLY NEW TRIMMERS IF YOU CAN AND THEN WATCH FOR ANY BLEEDING
hjCSXj24vt8_8 0 IF YOU DO SEE ANY BLEEDING USED STYPTIC POWDER WHICH YOU CAN GET AT ANY PET STORE AND YOU SHOULD ALWAYS KEEP ON HAND IF YOU'RE TRIMMING NAILS
GSV8PEAEDTE_1 0 IN THIS FINAL FIGURE WE ARE RESTING ON ALL THE EIGHTH NOTES
GSV8PEAEDTE_2 0 ONE AND TWO AND AND WE ARE PLAYING ON THE E'S AND THE UH'S
GSV8PEAEDTE_3 0 TRICKY LITTLE EXERCISE GO VERY SLOW AND COUNT OUT LOUD IT'S LIKE THIS
GSV8PEAEDTE_4 0 ONE E AND UH TWO E AND UH
GSV8PEAEDTE_5 0 IT IS LIKE AFTER NOTE LIKE WE DID WITH THE EIGHTH NOTES
GSV8PEAEDTE_6 0 ONE AND TWO AND THREE AND FOUR AND SAME THING ONE E AND UH TWO E AND UH
GSV8PEAEDTE_7 0 AGAIN IF YOU PLAYED IT FAST ONE E AND UH TWO E AND UH ONE E AND UH TWO E AND UH JUST GO SLOW ONE E AND UH TWO E AND UH
GSV8PEAEDTE_8 0 WITH THE METRONOME READY GO
GSV8PEAEDTE_9 0 ONE E AND UH TWO E AND UH ONE E AND UH TWO E AND UH ONE E AND UH TWO E AND UH ONE E AND UH TWO E AND UH ONE E AND UH TWO E AND UH ONE E AND UH TWO E AND UH ONE E AND UH TWO E AND UH ONE E AND UH TWO E AND UH ONE E AND UH TWO E AND UH ONE E AND UH TWO E AND UH
hAUeqalPhWI_1 0 HI I'M TIM GIPSON AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MEASURE YOUR WINDOW FOR CURTAINS
hAUeqalPhWI_2 0 NOW WHEN YOU'RE MEASURING FOR CURTAINS SOME OF IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF CURTAIN THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PUT UP
hAUeqalPhWI_3 0 NOW LET ME POINT OUT WITH THESE THESE ARE SILK SHEERS
hAUeqalPhWI_4 0 SO AS YOU LOOK DOWN HERE AT THE BOTTOM YOU CAN SEE THEY POOL A LITTLE BIT AT THE FLOOR
hAUeqalPhWI_5 0 SO YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AND THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'RE GOING TO FIND COMMON WITH SILK SHEERS IS THAT YOU WANT THEM TO POOL AT THE FLOOR LIKE THIS
hAUeqalPhWI_6 0 NOW YOUR REGULAR CURTAINS WILL STOP JUST SHORT OF THE FLOOR
hAUeqalPhWI_7 0 SO THAT'S SOMETHING YOU WANT TO CONSIDER ABOUT YOU GOT TO WHEN YOU THINK OF THE LENGTH OF YOUR CURTAINS AND THEN HOW THEY'RE GOING TO FLOW DOWN
hAUeqalPhWI_8 0 NOW IN THIS PARTICULAR HOME THESE HAVE NINE FOOT CEILINGS IN THIS HOME SO IT'S NOT QUITE AS CRITICAL WHERE YOU HANG YOUR OVERALL CURTAINS
hAUeqalPhWI_9 0 BUT IF YOU HAVE SHORTER CEILINGS SUCH AS AN EIGHT FOOT CEILING ONE THING THAT YOU CAN DO CURTAINS CAN HELP YOU ACTUALLY MAKE THE ROOM LOOK TALLER
hAUeqalPhWI_10 0 SO WHERE WE HAVE THESE PARTICULAR CURTAINS HUNG JUST A COUPLE OF INCHES ABOUT THREE INCHES OVER THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THE ROOM LOOK TALLER WE'D ACTUALLY COME UP TO A POINT THAT'S HALFWAY BETWEEN THE CROWN AND THE TOP OF THE WINDOW
hAUeqalPhWI_11 0 AND THEN THE OTHER THING YOU WANT TO CONSIDER IS HOW WIDE YOU WANT YOUR CURTAIN ROD
hAUeqalPhWI_12 0 NOW IF YOU WANT YOUR WINDOWS TO BE OPEN IF YOU'RE HANGING SOLID CURTAINS HERE AND YOU WANT YOUR WINDOWS TO BE OPEN THEN YOU'D WANT THIS CURTAIN ROD TO MAYBE BE EIGHT INCHES OR SO WIDER THAN THE ACTUAL WINDOW OPENING
hAUeqalPhWI_13 0 SO WITH THOSE THINGS IN MIND AND WE'LL JUST LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR ONE WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT A SHEER SO WE WOULD MEASURE THE LENGTH OF THE TO KNOW THE LENGTH OF OUR SHEERS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO SIMPLY MEASURE UP AND WE WANT THE CURTAIN ROD SITTING ABOUT A HALF AN INCH LOWER THAN WHAT THE ACTUAL LENGTH IS
hAUeqalPhWI_14 0 SO IN THIS CASE WHEN I MEASURE UP WE'VE GOT ABOUT EIGHTY-FOUR INCHES SO THE ACTUAL CURTAIN LENGTH WOULD BE ABOUT EIGHTY-FOUR AND A HALF SO THAT EXTRA HALF AN INCH IS GOING TO ALLOW US THAT CURTAIN
hAUeqalPhWI_15 0 AND THEN TO MEASURE THE WIDTH OF THE CURTAIN ROD IN THIS CASE SINCE THIS IS A SHEER WE WANT TO BE JUST A LITTLE BIT WIDER SO WE'LL MEASURE OUR OPENING AND YOU WANT TO GO INSIDE DIMENSIONS TO INSIDE DIMENSIONS WE GOT THIRTY-FIVE
hAUeqalPhWI_16 0 SO IN THIS CASE WE WANT OUR BRACKETS AND OUR ROD TO BE JUST A FEW INCHES LONGER THAN THAT OPENING
hAUeqalPhWI_17 0 SO I'M TIM GIPSON AND THAT IS HOW TO MEASURE FOR CURTAINS
GDUxtkCe5uA_1 0 CHRISTIE OWNES HI
GDUxtkCe5uA_2 0 MY NAME IS CHRISTIE AND I'M WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
GDUxtkCe5uA_3 0 AND I'M TEACHING YOU PROPER CARE OF FISH TODAY AND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FISH
GDUxtkCe5uA_4 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SECOND PROCESS OF CYCLING YOUR TANK OUT WHICH IS CALLED THE NITRITE CYCLE
GDUxtkCe5uA_5 0 THE AMMONIA IS GOING TO BE THE FIRST PART OF THE CYCLE
GDUxtkCe5uA_6 0 THE SECOND PART IS GOING TO BE THE NITRITE
GDUxtkCe5uA_7 0 IN ABOUT WEEK THREE TO FOUR AS THE AMMONIA LEVELS ARE COMING BACK DOWN THE NITRITE LEVEL IS GOING TO GO UP
GDUxtkCe5uA_8 0 THE NITRITE LEVEL WILL GO ALL THE WAY UP PEAK OUT AND DROP BACK DOWN
GDUxtkCe5uA_9 0 USUALLY IT TAKES ABOUT SIX WEEKS FOR THIS PROCESS
GDUxtkCe5uA_10 0 SOMETIMES IT CAN TAKE A LITTLE LONGER AND TAKE EIGHT WEEKS
GDUxtkCe5uA_11 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE TO YOU NOW IS HOW TO DO A NITRITE TEST
GDUxtkCe5uA_12 0 AS WE DID WITH THE AMMONIA TEST WE'RE GOING TO GET OUR TEST VIAL THAT HAS THE SAME LITTLE WHITE LINE ON IT
GDUxtkCe5uA_13 0 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE WATER OUT OF THE TANK AND PUT INTO THE TUBE JUST LIKE WE DID ON THE AMMONIA TEST
GDUxtkCe5uA_14 0 YOU CAN TELL THAT WE FILLED THE BOTTLE TO THE WHITE LINE WITH THE WATER
GDUxtkCe5uA_15 0 WE'LL SET THIS DOWN AND WE'LL GET THE NITRITE TEST BOX WHICH IS PINK
GDUxtkCe5uA_16 0 ON IT IT HAS ADD FIVE DROPS
GDUxtkCe5uA_17 0 WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'RE GOING TO REMOVE THE CAP OFF THE BOTTLE ADD FIVE DROPS PUT THE TOP BACK ON AND SHAKE THE VIAL TOWARD THE COLOR
GDUxtkCe5uA_18 0 THIS TEST PROCESS TAKES FIVE MINUTES BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S SHOWING A NICE PRETTY BLUE COLOR
GDUxtkCe5uA_19 0 IF THIS GOES FROM A NICE PRETTY BLUE COLOR TO A PURPLE COLOR THEN WE HAVE HIGH NITRITES IN THE TANK WHICH IS ALSO BAD FOR THE FISH AS WELL AS THE AMMONIA PROCESS
GDUxtkCe5uA_20 0 NITRITE LEVELS CAN ALSO BE CAUSED FROM TOO MUCH FISH FOOD AND TOO MANY FISH IN THE TANK AS WELL AS AMMONIA
GDUxtkCe5uA_21 0 IF YOU HAVE AMMONIA AND NITRITE IN A TANK BOTH AT THE SAME TIME THEN YOU NEED TO DO SOME MAJOR SURGERY ON YOUR TANK TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM AND FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS
GDUxtkCe5uA_22 0 'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T UNFORTUNATELY YOU CAN LOSE YOUR WHOLE TANK
GDUxtkCe5uA_23 0 SO IF YOU HAVE A FISH TANK MONITOR YOUR AMMONIA AND YOUR NITRITE AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK IF NOT ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS JUST TO KEEP CHECK ON EVERYTHING TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S HAPPY AND OKAY
H2q3JOMMNCQ_1 0 HI I AM JEN FROM CLAY CAFE AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'LL BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO TAKE YOU'RE CERAMIC PIECE FROM START TO FINISH
H2q3JOMMNCQ_2 0 ONCE A PIECE HAS BEEN PAINTED AND THE DESIGN IS COMPLETE THE NEXT THE PIECES GOING INTO THE PROCESSING STAGE
H2q3JOMMNCQ_3 0 TO START THE PROCESSING STAGE WE ENTER INTO THE CLEAR GLAZING
H2q3JOMMNCQ_4 0 THIS DOESN'T LOOK VERY CLEAR IT ACTUALLY HAS A PURPLISH TINT TO IT AND THE REASON THAT IS DONE IS THE MANUFACTURERS ACTUALLY ADD A FOOD COLOR MINERAL INTO THE GLAZE AND IT ACTS AS A VISUAL GUIDE TO THE GLAZERS WHO NEED TO COVER AN IDEA PIECE INSURING EVERYTHING IS NICE AND SEALED WATERTIGHT AND OF COURSE FOOD SAFE
H2q3JOMMNCQ_5 0 SO TO START THE GLAZING PROCESS WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE OUR GLAZE IS VERY WELL MIXED AND HAS THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY
H2q3JOMMNCQ_6 0 A GREAT PRODUCT THAT IS A LITTLE STRANGE BUT WORKS REALLY REALLY GREAT FOR MIXING YOUR GLAZE IS A TOILET BRUSH BELIEVE IT OR NOT
H2q3JOMMNCQ_7 0 TOILET BRUSHES ARE REALLY REALLY GREAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE ALL THESE BRISTLES AND IT WILL SCOOP UP ANY OF THE SLUDGE THAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOUR GLAZE SITS
H2q3JOMMNCQ_8 0 SO YOU JUST WANT TO GIVE IT A REALLY NICE GOOD STIR
H2q3JOMMNCQ_9 0 A COUPLE OF TIMES
H2q3JOMMNCQ_10 0 AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS REALLY NICELY MIXED AND YOU'RE READY TO START GLAZING
H2q3JOMMNCQ_11 0 SOME PEOPLE WILL DIP PIECES INTO A CLEAR GLAZE AND OTHER CHOOSE TO PAINT IT ON
H2q3JOMMNCQ_12 0 I REALLY LIKE THE NON-ABRASIVENESS OF DIPPING BECAUSE REALLY YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING THE PIECES A WHOLE LOT AND WHEN YOU ARE PAINTING YOUR CLEAR GLAZE ON WHAT CAN HAPPEN IS AS SOON AS THE PIECE GETS WET YOU REACTIVATE THE PAINT AND WHEN A PAINT IS REACTIVATED IT'S VERY EASY FOR YOU TO START MOVING IT WHEN YOU ARE BRUSHING IT ON
H2q3JOMMNCQ_13 0 SO TO START TO DIP YOUR PIECE WHICH IS WHAT I PREFER YOU'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE I'M DOING A SIMPLE TILE HERE AND I AM ACTUALLY ONLY GOING TO DIP ONE HALF FIRST AND THEN DIP THE OTHER HALF
H2q3JOMMNCQ_14 0 I'LL ALSO SHOW YOU THE SAME TECHNIQUE ON A BOWL AND THE WAY WE DO THAT
H2q3JOMMNCQ_15 0 WE ONLY DIP HALF A PIECE AT A TIME SO AS TO NOT DISTURB THE PAINT UNDERNEATH
H2q3JOMMNCQ_16 0 IF I AM PUTTING MY FINGERS ALL OVER THE WET GLAZES I CAN EASILY SMUDGE AND PUT MY FINGERPRINTS INTO THE PERSON'S GLAZE WHICH MOST CUSTOMERS DON'T WANT
H2q3JOMMNCQ_17 0 SO WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS I AM GOING TO TAKE THE PIECE AND DIP IT LIGHTLY AND GIVE IT A REALLY GOOD SHAKE
H2q3JOMMNCQ_18 0 SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO BLOW ON THE PIECE TO GET THE EXCESS PAINT OFF BUT I FIND SOMETIMES THAT CREATES SOME DRIP MARKS SO I TEND TO JUST SHAKE THE PIECE OFF
H2q3JOMMNCQ_19 0 AND THEN IT'S COVERED IN PURPLE AND I JUST LAY IT DOWN ON THIS DRYING GRID AND IT CAN JUST SIT THERE TO DRY UNTIL IT'S READY FOR IT'S NEXT DIP
H2q3JOMMNCQ_20 0 ALL OF THE EXCESS GLAZE NICELY DRIPS OFF ONTO THIS MAT AND WE JUST MAKE SURE THAT WE CLEAN IT PERIODICALLY SO THAT THE GLAZE DOESN'T BUILD UP AND START TO AFFECT THE BOTTOM OF THE PIECES
H2q3JOMMNCQ_21 0 NEXT I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO CLEAR GLAZE A BOWL
H2q3JOMMNCQ_22 0 BOWLS ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND IT'S EASIER TO SHOW YOU THE HALF AND HALF STEP
H2q3JOMMNCQ_23 0 SO ALL I'M GOING TO DO IS TO TAKE THE PIECE AND I'M GOING TO DUNK IT AND GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT OF A SWOOP PICK IT UP AND OF COURSE GIVE IT ANOTHER SHAKE
H2q3JOMMNCQ_24 0 YOU GIVE IT A REALLY REALLY GOOD SHAKE TO GET ALL THE EXCESS GLAZE OFF CAUSE YOU ONLY REALLY WANT A NICE THIN LAYER OF THE CLEAR GLAZE ONTO YOUR PIECE
H2q3JOMMNCQ_25 0 AND THEN YOU'RE PIECE WILL JUST SIT ON THE GLAZING RACK UNTIL IT'S READY TO BE CLEANED
G83C863C5Iw_1 0 ONE OTHER WAY I LIKE TO PREPARE BEFORE GOING INTO THE DARKROOM IS TO MAKE SURE THAT MY NEGATIVE IS NICE AND CLEAN
G83C863C5Iw_2 0 THIS IS A MEDIUM FORMAT NEGATIVE IN THIS NEGATIVE CARRIER HERE
G83C863C5Iw_3 0 AGAIN I JUST LIKE TO SET IT UP AND SORT OF LOOK AT IT
G83C863C5Iw_4 0 IF YOU SORT OF HOLD IT IN A CERTAIN WAY YOU CAN SEE IF THERE'S ANY KIND OF WATER MARKS OR DUST OR JUST SOMETHING THAT LOOKS KIND OF NASTY ON THERE
G83C863C5Iw_5 0 ONE ITEM I REALLY ENJOY CLEANING MY NEGATIVES WITH IS THIS ANTI-STATIC CLOTH
G83C863C5Iw_6 0 A LOT OF PHOTOGRAPHERS USED CANNED AIR
G83C863C5Iw_7 0 I'M NOT REALLY A BIG FAN OF CANNED AIR
G83C863C5Iw_8 0 IT SPRAYS A LOT OF MOISTURE OUT SOMETIMES AND I DON'T LIKE CANNED AIR IN CERTAIN DARKROOMS I WORK IN BECAUSE CANNED AIR WITH DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHERS OR DIGITAL CAMERAS IS A BIG NO-NO
G83C863C5Iw_9 0 YOU'LL RUIN YOUR CHIP IF YOU GET A LITTLE BIT OF MOISTURE ON THERE
G83C863C5Iw_10 0 SO THIS CLOTH IS A GREAT LITTLE ITEM
G83C863C5Iw_11 0 BEAUTIFUL IN ITS SIMPLICITY IN THAT YOU JUST HOLD IT AND YOU TAKE YOUR NEGATIVE AND YOU JUST WIPE IT DOWN
G83C863C5Iw_12 0 THEN YOU LOOK AT IT AS LONG AS IT LOOKS CLEAN YOU'RE GOOD TO START PRINTING
gEzFKa_8M1A_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS ORESTES GUADA FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
gEzFKa_8M1A_2 0 TODAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT PAINTBALL EQUIPMENT
gEzFKa_8M1A_3 0 THESE ARE MY SHOES
gEzFKa_8M1A_4 0 YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ALRIGHT THESE ARE GOLF SHOES THESE HAVE FOR THE TURF CAUSE WE DON'T PLAY ON GRASS NO MORE SO THEY WOULD THROW CARPET ON TOP OF CONCRETE
gEzFKa_8M1A_5 0 SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO GRAB THESE ARE GOLF SHOES ACTUALLY THESE ARE NOT PAINTBALL SHOES BUT YOU COULD REPLACE ALL THESE LITTLE SPIKES SO IN CASE THEY WORE OUT OR ANYTHING LIKE THEY WOULD FIT PERFECT
gEzFKa_8M1A_6 0 AND EVERY TIME YOU GOT TO SWITCH THOSE SPIKES SO YOU CAN'T SLIP
gEzFKa_8M1A_7 0 THAT IS THE NAME OF THE GAME IF YOU SLIP WHILE YOU ARE RUNNING TO A BUNKER IT IS NOT GOOD
gEzFKa_8M1A_8 0 YOU WOULD GET SHOT OFF BREAK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
gEzFKa_8M1A_9 0 MAKE SURE THAT THESE CLEATS THEY ARE REALLY NICE
gEzFKa_8M1A_10 0 I'M MISSING A COUPLE ACTUALLY
g9gX4Wq7-rU_1 0 IN THIS SECTION WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS SOME METHODS YOU CAN USE IN DEALING WITH TOUGH CUSTOMERS
g9gX4Wq7-rU_2 0 I'M PAMELA UNRUH ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
g9gX4Wq7-rU_3 0 AS WE TALK ABOUT REWARDING GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE A LOT OF COMPANIES ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE INCENTIVE OR REWARD PROGRAMS
g9gX4Wq7-rU_4 0 PERHAPS YOU WORK FOR A SMALLER BUSINESS OR PERHAPS YOU WORK FOR AN EMPLOYER WHO DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUCH INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE RIGHT NOW
g9gX4Wq7-rU_5 0 YOU ASK A CUSTOMER SERVICE PROVIDER CAN FEEL FREE TO ASK FOR SUCH A PROGRAM
g9gX4Wq7-rU_6 0 MAYBE IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT YOUR EMPLOYER HAS CONSIDERED IN THE PAST
g9gX4Wq7-rU_7 0 BUT HERE IS THE TRICK WHEN YOU APPROACH ANY EMPLOYER ABOUT ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT THEM TO PUT INTO PLACE RESEARCH THE COST
g9gX4Wq7-rU_8 0 NOW ANYTHING THAT COST VERY LITTLE OR IS FREE IS GOING TO BE MUCH MORE APPEALING TO YOUR EMPLOYER
g9gX4Wq7-rU_9 0 DON'T GO TO YOUR EMPLOYER AND SAY HEY HOW ABOUT THE PERSON WHO SOUNDS THE BEST ON THE PHONE GETS A CRUISE TO THE BAHAMAS
g9gX4Wq7-rU_10 0 NO ONE IS GOING TO GO FOR THAT YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC
g9gX4Wq7-rU_11 0 START SMALL THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU CAN ASK FOR THAT WILL COST YOUR EMPLOYER REALLY NEXT TO NOTHING
g9gX4Wq7-rU_12 0 GO TO YOUR EMPLOYER WITH SUGGESTIONS THAT PERHAPS YOU CAN HAVE AN EXTRA HOUR FOR LUNCH ONE DAY A WEEK
g9gX4Wq7-rU_13 0 MAYBE YOU CAN GET HALF A DAY OFF WITH PAY OR MAYBE YOU CAN GET AN EXTRA DAY THAT YOU CAN USE AS AN UNEXCUSED ABSENCE
g9gX4Wq7-rU_14 0 THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS LIKE THAT THAT EMPLOYERS WOULD BE WILLING TO GO ALONG WITH BUT THE KEY AGAIN YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON COST YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE ASPECT OF THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND JUST LET YOUR EMPLOYER KNOW WHY YOU THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL NOT ONLY TO YOU BUT TO THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE
gWkdfyqD35U_1 0 HELLO AND WELCOME TO EXPERT VILLAGE
gWkdfyqD35U_2 0 I'M PHILLIP TORIELLO FROM THE AVILA BAY ATHLETIC CLUB
gWkdfyqD35U_3 0 BREATHING DRILLS FOR FREESTYLE ARE REALLY QUITE IMPORTANT TO HELP MAXIMIZE YOUR V02 CAPACITY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO KEEP THAT HEAD DOWN AND FOCUSED
gWkdfyqD35U_4 0 WHEN YOU ARE ON LAND WE ARE BREATHING AS COMFORTABLY AS WE WISH TO
gWkdfyqD35U_5 0 HOWEVER IN FREESTYLE AND MOST IN PARTICULAR WITH FREESTYLE YOUR FACE IS IN THE WATER AND IT'S RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO AREN'T USED TO SWIMMING BUT THE MORE OFTEN YOU SWIM THE EASIER IT WILL BECOME AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO LOOSEN UP A LITTLE BIT AND ADAPT TO THE WATER ENVIRONMENT
gWkdfyqD35U_6 0 ONE VERY IMPORTANT DRILL THAT BEGINNER SWIMMERS CAN USE IS SIMPLY IN THEIR OWN BATH TUB OR IN A JACUZZI OR A SWIMMING POOL AND THAT'S SIMPLY PUTTING YOUR FACE IN THE WATER BLOWING YOUR BUBBLES OUT NICE AND SLOW AND TURNING YOUR FACE TO THE SIDE
gWkdfyqD35U_7 0 I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PARTICULAR DRILL TO HELP PEOPLE WHO AREN'T AS USED TO SWIMMING ACCLIMATE TO THE POOL ENVIRONMENT
gWkdfyqD35U_8 0 FOR THE MORE COMPETITIVE SWIMMER BREATHING DRILLS WOULD INCLUDE THE THREE FIVE SEVEN DRILL DURING WHICH YOU'LL UTILIZE THE POOL BUOY
gWkdfyqD35U_9 0 THE THREE FIVE SEVEN DRILL IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN USE IN A TWENTY FIVE YARD POOL OR EVEN A FIFTY METER POOL

Gx3EMuPBBzA_1 0 I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
Gx3EMuPBBzA_2 0 MY NAME IS JOHNNY AND I WORK HERE AT THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT
Gx3EMuPBBzA_3 0 I'LL BE SHOWING YOU WHAT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IN OUR SAVORY CREPE
Gx3EMuPBBzA_4 0 RIGHT HERE AS MY DAD HAS ALREADY SHOWN YOU ALL THE INGREDIENTS
Gx3EMuPBBzA_5 0 FOR BREAKFAST CREPE ALL WE NEED IS A PORTION OF CHEESE PORTION OF HAM AND ONE GOOD SCOOP FULL OF EGG
Gx3EMuPBBzA_6 0 SINCE THIS IS A SAVORY CREPE THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF MAKING IT FROM THE SWEET CREPES
Gx3EMuPBBzA_7 0 SWEET CREPES YOU JUST PUT THEM AND FOLD THEM ON AND GET PUT THEM OVER HERE
Gx3EMuPBBzA_8 0 SAVORY CREPES WE HAVE TO HAVE THE BATTER READY OVER HERE
Gx3EMuPBBzA_9 0 WE HAVE TO PUT EVERYTHING ON TOP OF THE BATTER WHILE IT'S STILL ON THE GRILL
Gx3EMuPBBzA_10 0 THEN WE FOLD IT ALL IN
Gx3EMuPBBzA_11 0 FOLD IT IN AND JUST STICK IT IN THE OVEN
GGddM69-f1c_2 0 MY NAME IS LESLIE MOSELLE AND I AM FROM TAMPA FLORIDA AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE THIS IS HOW TO DO LAUNDRY
GGddM69-f1c_3 0 DELICATE CLOTHES ARE PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO BE CAREFUL WITH WHEN DRYING
GGddM69-f1c_4 0 THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS FOR DRYING YOUR DELICATE CLOTHES
GGddM69-f1c_5 0 THE OPTION THAT I LIKE TO CHOOSE IS HANG DRY THEM
GGddM69-f1c_6 0 THIS MAY TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER BUT THIS IS GOING TO MAKE YOUR CLOTHES LOOK AS GOOD AS THEY CAN AND LAST A LOT LONGER
GGddM69-f1c_7 0 SO ONCE YOU'VE TAKEN YOUR TIME TO PUT THE RIGHT SETTING THE RIGHT DETERGENT AND THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE OF WATER FOR YOUR DELICATE CLOTHES AND ONCE THEY ARE OUT OF THE WASHER AND THE WASHER IS DONE YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE THEM DIRECTLY OUT AND HANG THEM
GGddM69-f1c_8 0 THIS WILL PROBABLY TAKE OVERNIGHT TO DRY DEPENDING ON HOW HEAVY THE MATERIAL IS BUT THIS WILL MAKE YOUR CLOTHES LOOK GREAT FOR A LONG TIME YOUR COLORS WON'T FADE MUCH FROM DRYING AND EVEN IF THEY ARE COTTON OR SILK YOU KNOW IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER RIGHT OUT OF THE WASHER YOU CAN JUST HANG THEM HERE OR HANG THEM IN A DOORWAY AND THIS GOES FOR BOTH LIGHTS AND DELICATE CLOTHES
GGddM69-f1c_9 0 AND WHATEVER KNITS AND SILKS YOU FEEL YOU DON'T WANT TO GET DAMAGED AS SOON AS THEY ARE OUT OF THE WASHER YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND HANG THEM UP AND LET THEM AIR DRY
GGddM69-f1c_10 0 NOW THE OTHER OPTION THAT YOU CAN HAVE FOR DRYING YOUR DELICATES IS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WAIT THAT LONG AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO LET THEM AIR DRY THERE IS FLUFF AIR ON YOUR DRYER CYCLE
GGddM69-f1c_11 0 NOW SOME DRYERS WILL SAY DELICATES ON THE DRYER ITSELF AND THAT WILL BE A SETTING AVAILABLE TO YOU
GGddM69-f1c_12 0 BUT ON THIS ONE YOU HAVE FLUFF AIR
GGddM69-f1c_13 0 THIS WILL PREVENT FROM HAVING A HIGH HEAT OR TOO MUCH HEAT APPLIED TO YOUR DELICATE CLOTHES
GGddM69-f1c_14 0 IT MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN A NORMAL DRYER CYCLE BUT THIS IS FASTER THAN AIR DRYING AND IT IS ALSO PROTECTS YOUR DELICATES FROM ANY DAMAGE
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_1 0 HI I'M BRYAN BILLHIMER AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO RE-STRING AND TUNE A GUITAR
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_2 0 NOW THAT WE'VE BOILED OUR STRINGS AND YOU WANT TO LET THEM SIT AND COOL FOR A FEW MINUTES
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_3 0 AFTER THAT WE'RE READY TO PUT OUR STRINGS ON
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_4 0 THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS REMEMBER HOW WE TOOK OUR BRIDGE OFF WHEN WE WERE CLEANING THE GUITAR WE WANT TO PUT THEM BRIDGE BACK ON
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_6 0 THE FIRST STRING YOU WANT TO PUT ON IT THE THICKEST STRING THAT'S YOUR LOW E STRING
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_7 0 YOU WANT MAKE SURE I'VE MADE THE MISTAKE OF PUTTING THE WRONG STRING IN THE WRONG SPOT AND THAT'S NOT GOOD SO MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT THE THICKEST STRING
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_8 0 A LOT OF STRINGS ARE COLOR COATED THESE HAPPEN TO NOT BE
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_9 0 WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE FIRST STRING ON WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE BALL END OF THE STRING WE'RE GOING TO PUT THAT RIGHT IN THIS SLOT ON THE TAIL PIECE
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_10 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S SNUG
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_11 0 THAT'S GOING TO COME OUT GO RIGHT OVER TOP OF THE SADDLE SEE HOW THERE S A LITTLE GROOVE IN THIS SADDLE
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_12 0 IT SITS IN THERE
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_13 0 NOW TO DO THE OTHER END YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT THE GUITAR UPRIGHT
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_14 0 WE HAVE IT LOCKED IN DOWN THERE NOW THERE S LITTLE HOLES IN THESE TUNING PEGS I LIKE TO HAVE TO HOLES FACING NINETY DEGREES TO THE NECK SO WE'RE GOING TO INSERT THE STRING THIS WAY
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_15 0 YOU WANT TO GIVE YOURSELF A LITTLE SLACK TOO
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_16 0 WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE STRING IN LIKE THAT WE'RE GOING TO PULL IT IN THIS WAY
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_17 0 I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE SOME SLACK IN THIS STRING SO THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH STRING TO WRAP AROUND
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_18 0 NOW THAT WE HAVE THAT IN WE ARE GOING TO WRAP THIS BACK AROUND YOU WANT TO PULL THAT NICE AND TIGHT UNDERNEATH AND PULL THAT TIGHT JUST LIKE THAT
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_19 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO PULL IT UP AND SEE HOW IT'S UNDERNEATH THE STRING WE BROUGHT IN AND NOW YOU WANT TO START TIGHTENING
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_20 0 YOU WANT TO TIGHTEN IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_21 0 MOVE THE STRING AND MAKE SURE IT'S IN THE RIGHT SLOT AND THE NUT YOU WANT IT IN THE FIRST SLOT
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_22 0 PULL THAT TIGHT AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP PULLING THIS TIGHT AS WE'RE WINDING
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_23 0 THEN YOU WIND IT UP AND CHECK IT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT JUST HAS TO BE TIGHT ENOUGH THAT EVERYTHING IS SECURE
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_24 0 SO NOW WE HAVE OUR FIRST STRING ON
hIc9x5jQhUE_1 0 AS WE AGE WE LOSE FLEXIBILITY
hIc9x5jQhUE_2 0 SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE FLEXIBILITY EXERCISES INTO YOUR ROUTINE ON A DAILY BASIS
hIc9x5jQhUE_3 0 EVER NOTICE HOW CHILDREN ARE VERY VERY FLEXIBLE
hIc9x5jQhUE_4 0 AND THEN AS YOU AGE YOU START TO LOSE THAT ABILITY TO REACH ALL THE WAY DOWN TO YOUR TOES LIKE YOU COULD WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG
hIc9x5jQhUE_5 0 IT'S IMPORTANT TO INCREASE FLEXIBILITY FOR MANY REASONS
hIc9x5jQhUE_6 0 IT HELPS BRING NUTRITION TO THE JOINTS AND IT HELPS PREVENT RISK OF INJURY DURING ACTIVITIES
hIc9x5jQhUE_7 0 TO INCREASE FLEXIBILITY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU STRETCH EVERYDAY MAJOR MUSCLE GROUPS THAT YOU STRENGTHEN
hIc9x5jQhUE_8 0 WHEN YOU SHOULD STRETCH
hIc9x5jQhUE_9 0 YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY STRETCH AFTER YOUR WORK OUT
hIc9x5jQhUE_10 0 STRETCHING BEFORE IS OKAY BUT IT'S REALLY NOT GOING TO HELP YOU TO REALLY INCREASE THE FLEXIBILITY AND GAIN THE FLEXIBILITY THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
hIc9x5jQhUE_11 0 SO STRETCH YOUR MAJOR MUSCLE GROUPS ACROSS THE CHEST THE SHOULDERS THE TRICEPS THE UPPER BACK THE LOWER BACK THE QUADS THE HAMSTRINGS THE GLUTS AND OF COURSE THE CALF MUSCLES
hIc9x5jQhUE_12 0 HOLDING YOUR STRETCHES FOR ABOUT TEN TO THIRTY SECONDS WILL BRING OPTIMAL FLEXIBILITY
hIc9x5jQhUE_13 0 IF YOU CAN HOLD THEM A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAT'S GREAT
hIc9x5jQhUE_14 0 GOING THROUGH RANGE OF MOTION AND THEN HOLDING THE STRETCH WILL ALSO HELP
hIc9x5jQhUE_15 0 THERE'S LOT OF SCHOOLS WHO'VE THOUGHT ABOUT OUT THERE ABOUT FLEXIBILITY BUT THERE IS ONE TRUE THOUGHT AND THAT IS TO MAKE SURE ONCE YOU'VE WORK OUT THAT YOU DO YOUR FLEXIBILITY EXERCISES
hIc9x5jQhUE_16 0 THIS IS ALICE MONSAERT ENCOURAGING YOU TO GET ACTIVE AND INCLUDE FLEXIBILITY EVERY SINGLE DAY
H5i6iFqGC8E_1 0 HI MY NAME IS CHRIS FROM AQUATIC CENTRAL HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND ON THE WEB AT AQUATIC HYPHEN CENTRAL DOT COM
H5i6iFqGC8E_2 0 AND I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU HOW NOT TO KILL YOUR FISH
H5i6iFqGC8E_3 0 AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE ARE MANY WAYS OF NOT KILLING YOUR FISH
H5i6iFqGC8E_4 0 DON'T FEED IT TO YOUR DOG DON'T TAKE IT OUT OF THE WATER
H5i6iFqGC8E_5 0 DON'T LET IT BE EATEN BY OTHER FISH
H5i6iFqGC8E_6 0 WELL MORE PRACTICAL METHOD OF NOT KILLING YOUR FISH ARE TO SIMPLY KEEPING YOUR WATER CLEAN
H5i6iFqGC8E_7 0 DOING FREQUENT WATER CHANGES SERVICING YOUR FILTER CHECKING YOUR WATER PARAMETERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE IN ORDER
H5i6iFqGC8E_8 0 REGULAR INSPECTIONS OF YOUR FISH TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE HEALTHY REGULAR FEEDING
H5i6iFqGC8E_9 0 AGAIN THE MOST IMPORTANT AND CRUCIAL FACTORS KEEPING CLEAN WATER
H5i6iFqGC8E_10 0 SOME FISH FOR EXAMPLE THIS CLOWN LOACHES CAN LIVE EASILY OVER FIFTY YEARS
H5i6iFqGC8E_11 0 THESE FISH IN HERE ARE APPROXIMATELY SEVEN TO EIGHT INCHES AND PROBABLY ABOUT TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS OLD AT THE MOMENT
H5i6iFqGC8E_12 0 AGAIN THIS IS HOW NOT TO KILL YOUR FISH
H5i6iFqGC8E_13 0 MY NAME IS CHRIS FROM AQUATIC CENTRAL HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND ON THE WEB AT AQUATIC HYPHEN CENTRAL DOT COM
gxS9dFUSd90_1 0 ON THIS SEGMENT WE ARE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW IT LOOKS FROM ANOTHER ANGLE SO I WANT YOU TO TAKE NOTE OF HOW GARY TURNS AND GETS THE RACKET READY STEPS INTO THE BALL AND HITS IT BACK TO ME AND THEN NOTICE HOW I OPEN THE FACE OF THE RACQUET AND LOFT IT BACK SO HE CAN HIT IT BACK AGAIN
gxS9dFUSd90_2 0 SO LET'S SEE HOW WE DO ON THIS
gxS9dFUSd90_3 0 THAT'S GOOD IT IS A NICE EASY PACE AND WE CAN KEEP IT IN PLAY
gxS9dFUSd90_4 0 IF YOU WANT TO UP THE PACE A LITTLE BIT LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO
gxS9dFUSd90_5 0 YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT TO HAVE YOUR RACQUET READY
gxS9dFUSd90_6 0 WATCH HOW GARY STEPS INTO THE BALL
gxS9dFUSd90_7 0 THIS ALSO PREPARES YOU ON MY END ON HOW TO HANDLE A LOT OF LOOSE BALLS
gxS9dFUSd90_8 0 WE ARE GOING TO DO THE BACKHAND VOLLEY AND GARY IS GOING TO HIT A BACKHAND DRIVE TO ME SO THIS IS A GOOD ANGLE TO SEE HOW GARY PREPARES THE RACQUET TURNS THE SHOULDER AND STEPS INTO THE BALL AND IT IS ALSO GOING TO BE GOOD TO WATCH HOW I KEEP MY RACQUET UP AND I VOLLEY THE BALL GENTLY BY JUST OPENING THE FACE AND PUTTING IT BACK ON THE WALL
gxS9dFUSd90_9 0 SO LOOK AT HOW GARY JUST TURNS AND SITS THE BALL PRETTY EFFORTLESSLY STRAIGHT AND I JUST KEEP THE RACQUET OPEN AND IT REALLY DOESN'T TAKE MUCH WORK TO GET THE BALL BACK SO I HAVE DEVELOPED MY DROPPED VOLLEY AND GARY DEVELOPS HIS DRIVE AND IT IS QUITE A WORK OUT TOO
gxS9dFUSd90_10 0 SO THIS DRILL IS VERY VALUABLE TO PERFECT YOUR BACKHAND VOLLEY DROP AND YOUR BACKHAND DRIVE AND YOUR FOREHAND DROP AND YOUR FOREHAND DRIVE SO WORK IT EVERY TIME YOU PRACTICE AND YOU'LL SEE GREAT RESULTS
HJyj0AmglBA_1 0 OKAY IF YOU EVER GET WAX WHERE YOU DON'T WANT IT UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S ONLY ONE QUICK WAY TO REMOVE IT
HJyj0AmglBA_2 0 THE SLOW WAY IS TO SEND THIS ENTIRE PIECE BACK THROUGH THE BISK KILN
HJyj0AmglBA_3 0 THE WAX WILL BURN COMPLETELY OFF AND YOU'LL HAVE A FRESH START
HJyj0AmglBA_4 0 BUT IF YOU WANT TO DO IT IN THE SAME DAY YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE A THIN METAL RIB
HJyj0AmglBA_5 0 YOU WANT TO HOLD THIS IN YOUR HAND SO THAT IT HAS A CURVED EDGE AND YOU WANT TO HOLD IT PRETTY TIGHTLY
HJyj0AmglBA_6 0 BUT YOU WANT TO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU START SCRAPING NOT TO PUSH IT INTO YOUR PALM BECAUSE YOU CAN CUT YOURSELF IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL
HJyj0AmglBA_7 0 SO YOU TAKE THIS CURVED EDGE AND YOU LITERALLY CUT SOME OF THE BISK WARE AWAY BECAUSE THIS WAX HAS PERMEATED THE TOP LAYER OF THIS BISK WARE BISK WARE
HJyj0AmglBA_8 0 SO THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT OFF
HJyj0AmglBA_9 0 IT SOUNDS HORRIBLE
HJyj0AmglBA_10 0 IT'S LIKE FINGERNAILS ON A CHALK BOARD BUT IT WORKS
HJyj0AmglBA_11 0 AND THEN ONCE YOU'VE GOTTEN ALL THE WAX WHICH YOU CAN USUALLY SEE THE WAX PRETTY WELL
HJyj0AmglBA_12 0 IT WILL USUALLY BE DARKER THAN THE REST OF YOUR BISK
HJyj0AmglBA_13 0 ONCE YOU'VE GOTTEN ALL THAT OFF YOU CAN JUST TAKE A LITTLE PIECE OF SAND PAPER AND SMOOTH OVER THE AREA WERE YOU'VE SCRAPED SO THAT YOU'RE NOT LEFT WITH LINES GOUGED THROUGH YOUR PIECE
h0bjJlC-XfQ_1 0 SO IF WE TAKE AND USE OUR IMAGINATIONS AND PRETEND THAT WE'VE GOT TEN DOLLARS IN EACH OF CONTAINERS
h0bjJlC-XfQ_2 0 ONE DROP OF SOAP REPRESENTING A DOLLAR BILL AND WE TRY TO EVEN THOSE OUT JUST TO TRY TO GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF SUDS REPRESENTING CLEANING POWER WE'LL GO ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN WE'LL GO THIRTY DOLLARS VERSUS TEN DOLLARS
h0bjJlC-XfQ_3 0 AGAIN I'M SIMPLY TRYING TO GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF SUDS IN EACH ONE OF THESE CONTAINERS REPRESENTING CLEANING POWER
h0bjJlC-XfQ_4 0 SO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF SOAP AND WE STILL DON'T GET AS GOOD SUDS AND NOTICE THE CLARITY OF THOSE TWO WATERS
h0bjJlC-XfQ_5 0 WHICH WATER WOULD YOU RATHER BATHE IN
h0bjJlC-XfQ_6 0 WHICH WATER WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE YOUR CHILDREN BATHE IN
h0bjJlC-XfQ_7 0 WHICH WATER WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE IN YOUR HOME
h0bjJlC-XfQ_8 0 THAT IS WHERE THAT RING IN YOUR BATHTUB COMES FROM
h0bjJlC-XfQ_9 0 THAT'S WHERE THAT SOAP SCUM BUILD UP COMES FROM
h0bjJlC-XfQ_10 0 THAT'S WHERE ALL OF THOSE PROBLEMS ARE
h0bjJlC-XfQ_11 0 THE SPOTS ON YOUR DISHES
h0bjJlC-XfQ_12 0 THE RING IN YOUR TOILET
h0bjJlC-XfQ_13 0 ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE COMING FROM YOUR QUALITY OF WATER OR ARE EFFECTED BY YOUR QUALITY OF WATER ANYWAY
Gmos790Ildg_1 0 ESSENTIALLY WE HAVE COMPLETED THE SHAVE
Gmos790Ildg_2 0 BUT THE SKIN IS SENSITIVE
Gmos790Ildg_3 0 LIKE I SAID WE WENT THROUGH SURGERY AND NOW YOU WANT TO DRY OFF
Gmos790Ildg_4 0 DRY OFF WITH TOWEL A NICE CLEAN TOWEL
Gmos790Ildg_5 0 AND THEN YOU WANT TO APPLY SOME MOISTURIZER TO THE ENTIRE AREA SOME TYPE OF LOTION THAT WILL SOOTHE THE SKIN BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE BIT IRRITABLE NOW
Gmos790Ildg_6 0 NOT BAD BECAUSE WE DIDN'T DO MUCH
Gmos790Ildg_7 0 BUT IF YOU LEAVE IT ALONE WHEN EVERYTHING DRIES YOU FEEL STIFF
Gmos790Ildg_8 0 YOU FEEL LIKE SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED
Gmos790Ildg_9 0 SO YOU PUT ON A LITTLE MOISTURIZER OVER THE WHOLE AREA
Gmos790Ildg_10 0 AND ONCE YOU DO THIS YOU FORGOT THAT YOU EVEN SHAVED BECAUSE NOW YOUR SKIN IS RELAXED AGAIN
Gmos790Ildg_11 0 IT GETS A LITTLE IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU GO THROUGH SURGERY YOUR BODY GETS A LITTLE TRAUMA
Gmos790Ildg_12 0 SO NOW YOU ARE PUTTING ON MOISTURIZER AND IT RELAXES IT AGAIN
Gmos790Ildg_13 0 THE SKIN ISN'T TIGHT
Gmos790Ildg_14 0 YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE ANYTHING PULLING
Gmos790Ildg_15 0 YOU FEEL GOOD
Gmos790Ildg_16 0 YOU SMELL GOOD
Gmos790Ildg_17 0 YOU LOOK GOOD
Gmos790Ildg_19 0 AND IT HELPS YOUR CONFIDENCE
Gmos790Ildg_20 0 YOU MIGHT GET THAT RAISE THAT PROMOTION YOU'VE BEEN EXPECTING BECAUSE YOU HAVE A NICE GOOD SHAVE AND YOU'RE CLEAN
Gmos790Ildg_21 0 IT'S A GOOD IMAGE
Gmos790Ildg_22 0 AND PEOPLE WANT TO SUPPORT YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE A GOOD IMAGE OUT THERE
Gmos790Ildg_23 0 AND THAT'S IT
hgFreSjB6_U_1 0 SO AT THIS POINT YOU WANT YOUR NICE WIRE TOOL AND THEN LIKE THAT AND MOVE IT OVER TO THE LEFT
hgFreSjB6_U_2 0 AND UNLIKE THE LITTLE THE LITTLE PROJECTS THAT YOU MAKE ON THE WHEEL IT'S BETTER TO TAKE THESE VASES AND REALLY JUST USE YOUR BAT AND DON'T DON'T TAKE THEM OFF OF THE BAT UNTIL THEY ARE GOOD AND DRY AND SET UP
hgFreSjB6_U_3 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS TRY TO TAKE THIS TO MY WORK TABLE HERE AND JUST BY PICKING IT UP I CAN TELL THAT IT'S GOT A GOOD SOLID SHAPE GOOD SOLID FORM IT'S NOT BOTTOM HEAVY IT'S NOT TOP HEAVY AND BASICALLY IT'S SCREAMING AT ME TO MAKE IT KIND OF SQUARE
hgFreSjB6_U_4 0 SO WE SHOULD TAKE THIS AND CLEAN UP A LITTLE BIT AND WE'RE GOING TO START ACCESSORIZING IT

ghRSBlBdC64_2 0 YOU WANT IT TO BE YOUR LIFE'S WORK
ghRSBlBdC64_3 0 THEN WE WILL ACTUALLY LOOK BACK AT THE BAGUA AND FIGURE OUT WHERE A CAREER IS AND WORK ON THAT AREA
ghRSBlBdC64_4 0 AND THIS ONE'S EASY
ghRSBlBdC64_5 0 WHEREVER THE DOOR IS IN TO THE SPACE THE ROOM THE APARTMENT THE HOUSE THAT'S WHERE CAREER IS USUALLY SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT WALL THAT THE DOOR IS IN
ghRSBlBdC64_6 0 AGAIN YOU COULD CAN PUT SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE CREATED THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO KEEP CREATING AND MAKE IT YOUR CAREER
ghRSBlBdC64_7 0 YOU COULD HANG THAT ON THE WALL YOU COULD HAVE IT ON A TABLE THERE
ghRSBlBdC64_8 0 YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO CREATE BUT YOU'VE NOT EVEN DONE IT YET
ghRSBlBdC64_9 0 MAYBE YOU WANT TO WRITE A BOOK BUT YOU'RE NOT A WRITER
ghRSBlBdC64_10 0 YOU COULD WRITE DOWN THE TITLE OF THE BOOK AND PUT IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND JUST YOU KNOW STICK IT UNDER SOMETHING THAT'S IN THAT AREA AND IT'S JUST THE ENERGY OF THAT AND THE INTENTION OF THAT WILL BE THERE FOR YOU
ghRSBlBdC64_11 0 FOR CAREERS SPECIFICALLY THE COLOR WOULD BE BLACK AND WE ALSO TALK ABOUT WATER IN THIS AREA AS WELL FOR FLOW
ghRSBlBdC64_12 0 SO YOU CAN USE MIRRORS YOU CAN USE PICTURES WITH WATER IN IT
ghRSBlBdC64_13 0 AND YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DOOR IS ACTUALLY WORKING WELL
ghRSBlBdC64_14 0 THE ACTUAL DOOR IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT
ghRSBlBdC64_15 0 DOES IT CLOSE ALL THE WAY
ghRSBlBdC64_16 0 IS IT A LITTLE BIT STUCK
ghRSBlBdC64_17 0 DOES THE DOORKNOB TURN

ghRSBlBdC64_22 0 AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL TAKE OFF AND YOUR CREATIVITY WILL BECOME YOUR CAREER
ghRSBlBdC64_23 0 SO ANOTHER ADJUSTMENT THAT YOU CAN MAKE ACTUALLY IN THE CAREER AREA TO GET SOME MOVEMENT AND STIMULATE A LITTLE BIT IS TO ACTUALLY HANGING A BELL OR A WIND CHIME ON YOUR DOOR KNOB OR SOMEWHERE ON YOUR DOOR
ghRSBlBdC64_24 0 AND THE MOVEMENT OF IT THE SOUND HOPEFULLY WILL GET THINGS FLOWING
ghRSBlBdC64_25 0 MAYBE YOU CAN GET THE PHONE RINGING
ghRSBlBdC64_26 0 SO I WOULD PLACE IT THERE AND ACTUALLY RINGING IT ON PURPOSE NINE TIMES A DAY
ghRSBlBdC64_27 0 AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE NINE TIMES IN A ROW
ghRSBlBdC64_28 0 IT'S ACTUALLY BETTER IF YOU SPREAD IT OUT THROUGH OUT THE DAY
ghRSBlBdC64_29 0 EVERY TIME YOU HAPPEN TO WALK BY IT YOU'LL JUST RING IT A LITTLE BIT
ghRSBlBdC64_30 0 AND THINK OF THE INTENTION OF WHAT YOU WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN IN THAT AREA OF YOUR CREATIVITY BECOMING YOUR LIFE'S WORK AND YOUR CAREER WHENEVER YOU DO IT
HBPZgWQRKmw_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'LL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE MOST COMMON PHOBIAS
HBPZgWQRKmw_2 0 AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THERE ARE TWO MAIN TYPES OF PHOBIAS SPECIFIC PHOBIAS AND SOCIAL PHOBIAS
HBPZgWQRKmw_3 0 SOME EXAMPLES OF SPECIFIC PHOBIAS ARE THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT SUCH AS FEAR OF FLYING FEAR OF WATER WHICH IS ALSO CALLED HYDROPHOBIA FEAR OF HEIGHTS FEAR OF INJECTIONS AND THE NUMBER ONE FEAR OF DENTISTS
HBPZgWQRKmw_4 0 A LOT OF THEM ARE GOING TO SPECIFIC TO EVERYDAY THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER IN EVERYDAY LIFE
HBPZgWQRKmw_5 0 AS FAR AS SOCIAL PHOBIAS GO THEY'RE GOING TO BE MORE THAN JUST YOUR USUAL SHYNESS IN PUBLIC PLACES THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE JUST THINGS WHERE YOU TRY AND AVOID SOCIAL EVENTS THEY'RE GOING TO BE THINGS THAT PROVOKE ACTUAL ANXIETY
HBPZgWQRKmw_6 0 SO MAYBE GOING TO A FUND-RAISER ISN'T GOING TO BE YOUR THING OR ACTUALLY MAYBE JUST SITTING AT WORK YOU KNOW IN A BOARDROOM WITH OTHER CO-WORKERS IS GOING TO PROVOKE THE ANXIETY
HBPZgWQRKmw_7 0 AND KIND OF ADDING INTO THAT YOU HAVE THE LAST PIECE WHICH IS ACTUALLY CALLED AGORAPHOBIA
HBPZgWQRKmw_8 0 AND THAT IS WHEN YOU HAVE A FEAR OR A PHOBIA OF OPEN SPACES AND THAT CAN CAUSE PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY IN SEVERE CASES BOARD THEMSELVES UP IN THEIR HOUSE AND NOT WANT TO LEAVE BECAUSE THE MORE OPEN THEY ARE THE MORE EXPOSED THEY FEEL
GYw0bMkyoQo_1 0 SO THE NEXT EXERCISE WILL BE THE SEATED CABLE ROW
GYw0bMkyoQo_2 0 THIS IS TO WORK YOUR BACK AND PLEASE FOLLOW THE BENCH PRESS WITH THE SEATED CABLE ROW
GYw0bMkyoQo_3 0 APPROACH THE MACHINE AND HAVE A SEAT
GYw0bMkyoQo_4 0 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A NARROWER GRIP OR A CLOSE GRIP TO START OFF WITH
GYw0bMkyoQo_5 0 GRIP THE HANDLE SLIDE BACK SO THAT YOUR LEGS ARE JUST ABOUT STRAIGHT WITH A SLIGHT BEND IN YOUR KNEES
GYw0bMkyoQo_6 0 YOU'RE GOING TO BE PULLING YOUR HANDS DOWN TOWARDS YOUR NAVEL JUST ABOVE YOUR BELLY BUTTON
GYw0bMkyoQo_7 0 KEEP THE ELBOWS TIGHT INTO YOUR BODY AS YOU PULL BACK AND ROW YOUR SHOULDERS ONTO YOUR BACK EACH TIME YOU CAN COMPLETE A REPETITION
GYw0bMkyoQo_8 0 BE SURE TO PRESS INTO YOUR FEET EACH TIME FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND PULL YOUR BELLY BUTTON IN TOWARDS YOUR SPINE
GYw0bMkyoQo_9 0 THIS WILL TIGHTEN UP YOUR ABDOMINALS AND GIVE YOU SUPPORT POSTURAL SUPPORT FOR THE EXERCISE
GYw0bMkyoQo_10 0 EXHALE AS YOU PULL THE CABLE BACK TOWARDS YOU INHALE AS YOUR ARMS LENGTHEN
GYw0bMkyoQo_11 0 KEEP YOUR POSTURE UPRIGHT KEEP YOUR SPINE VERTICAL
GYw0bMkyoQo_12 0 LET THE ARMS AND YOUR SHOULDERS DO THE MOTION
GYw0bMkyoQo_13 0 PUSH WITH YOUR LEGS AGAIN PULL THE BELLY BUTTON IN TIGHTEN UP YOUR ABDOMINALS AND PULL YOUR HANDS INTO YOUR STOMACH ELBOWS CLOSE BY YOUR SIDE SHRUG YOUR SHOULDERS ONTO YOUR BACK
GYw0bMkyoQo_14 0 GO FOR IT
HCEhbsQ8cDY_1 0 SO WE TALKED ABOUT HOW IN THIS GAME ONE TURN OR ONE VOYAGE SHIP CAPTAIN CREW VOYAGE IS THREE ROLLS
HCEhbsQ8cDY_2 0 SO IN THOSE THREE ROLLS THE VERY FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO HAVE IS A SIX
HCEhbsQ8cDY_3 0 IF YOU ROLL AND SAY IT COMES UP LIKE THAT WITH NO SIXES THEN YOU CAN'T USE ANYTHING ELSE IN THE ROLL
HCEhbsQ8cDY_4 0 YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SIX FIRST
HCEhbsQ8cDY_5 0 SO A SHIP A SIX COMES FIRST
HCEhbsQ8cDY_6 0 SO I HAVE TO ROLL AND GET A SIX BEFORE I CAN USE ANYTHING ELSE
HCEhbsQ8cDY_7 0 THERE'S A SIX THEN A FIVE COMES NEXT WHICH IS THE CAPTAIN
HCEhbsQ8cDY_8 0 THERE'S THE CAPTAIN AND THEN I CAN'T USE THE CARGO UNLESS I HAVE A FOUR WHICH IS THE CREW
HCEhbsQ8cDY_9 0 BUT REMEMBER IF I SAY ROLL THAT I COULDN'T GO OH THERE'S THE CAPTAIN AND THERE'S THE CREW
HCEhbsQ8cDY_10 0 AND I'LL GET THE SHIP ON THE NEXT ROLL DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT
HCEhbsQ8cDY_11 0 SHIP NUMBER SIX COMES FIRST
G6LG4wlD8gs_1 0 HELLO WELCOME MY NAME IS JULIO NUTT
G6LG4wlD8gs_2 0 I'M A MASTER INSTRUCTOR AT THE JIM MCLEAN GOLF SCHOOL IN MIAMI FLORIDA
G6LG4wlD8gs_3 0 IN THIS CLIP WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO FIX YOUR GOLF SWING
G6LG4wlD8gs_4 0 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE BEST WAY TO WORK THE SWING IS THROUGH DRILLS THROUGH PRACTICING THE DIFFERENT MOTIONS AND THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SWING
G6LG4wlD8gs_5 0 MANY AMATEURS JUST WANT TO JUMP IN AND THEY WANT TO GRAB THEIR FIVE IRON AND THEY WANT TO HIT FULL SHOTS WITH FIVE IRON MAN
G6LG4wlD8gs_6 0 THEY EXPECT THE SWING TO CHANGE WHILE THEY'RE HITTING FULL SWING
G6LG4wlD8gs_7 0 IT'S A LOT EASIER TO GRAB A WEDGE A NINE IRON AND JUST MAKE HALF SWING
G6LG4wlD8gs_8 0 HALF CONNECTED SWING IF YOUR WORKING SOMETHING IN YOUR TAKE AWAY IF YOUR WORKING SOMETHING IN YOUR RELEASE
G6LG4wlD8gs_9 0 OR JUST TAKE A CLUB IF YOUR WORKING SOMETHING AT THE TOP OF YOUR SWING AND JUST PRACTICE THE POSITION
G6LG4wlD8gs_10 0 IF YOUR WORKING SOMETHING MAYBE IN AN OPEN CLUB FADE YOU HAVE YOUR LEFT WRIST TO BEND AT THE TOP
G6LG4wlD8gs_11 0 GO THERE AND FEEL THE CORRECT POSITION
G6LG4wlD8gs_12 0 MANY TIMES YOU CAN ALSO CLOSE YOUR EYES AND JUST GET TO THE CORRECT POSITION AND JUST FEEL THE RIGHT POSITION
G6LG4wlD8gs_13 0 FEEL YOUR BODY PARTS WHERE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE AND WITH REPETITION YOUR MUSCLE MEMORY IS GOING TO REPEAT THE MOVE AND IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU MAKE A BETTER GOLF SWING
gC1kAU1Jsoc_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS HIU ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHOW HOW TO COOK GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE
gC1kAU1Jsoc_2 0 THE FIRST RECIPE I'M GOING TO SHOW IS HOW TO MAKE GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE FROM SCRATCH
gC1kAU1Jsoc_3 0 THEN WE WOULD TURN UP THE HEAT ON THE STOVE HALF A POT OF WATER AND LET IT BOIL
gC1kAU1Jsoc_4 0 THEN WE WOULD PUT A PINCH OF SALT SO THAT IT WOULD KEEP THE GREEN COLOR OF THE GREEN BEANS AND WE WOULD DROP THE GREEN BEANS IN THE HOT WATER AND LET IT BOIL FOR FOUR FIVE MINUTES
gC1kAU1Jsoc_5 0 YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THE GREEN BEANS DURING THOSE FOUR AND FIVE MINUTES
gC1kAU1Jsoc_6 0 ONCE THE GREEN BEANS ARE READY YOU JUST HAVE TO DRAIN THE GREEN BEANS INTO A STRAINER
gC1kAU1Jsoc_7 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUN THEM NECESSARILY IN RUNNING WATER
h0w8WiVr6UY_1 0 THE OTHER ESSENTIAL TOOL FOR BEAD MAKING IS A KILN
h0w8WiVr6UY_2 0 AND AS MENTIONED IN EARLIER SEGMENTS THE KILN PERFORMS TWO FUNCTIONS
h0w8WiVr6UY_3 0 IT ALLOWS THE BEAD TO COOL OFF VERY GENTLY SO AS TO AVOID THERMAL SHOCK WHICH WILL CAUSE CRACKING IN A BEAD
h0w8WiVr6UY_4 0 AND IT ALSO IMPORTANTLY PERFORMS THE FUNCTION OF ANNEALING THE BEAD ANNEALING IS THE PROCESS OF MAKING HAPPY GLASS MOLECULES
h0w8WiVr6UY_5 0 WHERE THE GLASS MOLECULES GET TO VIBRATE
h0w8WiVr6UY_6 0 ANNEALING DOESN'T CHANGE THE LOOK OF THE BEAD IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE SHAPE OF THE BEAD
h0w8WiVr6UY_7 0 BUT IT GETS THE TEMPERATURE HIGH ENOUGH IN THE CASE OF THE EFFETRE ITALIAN GLASS WE'RE USING NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT GETS THE GLASS HOT ENOUGH SO THAT THE MOLECULES IN THE BEAD FORM GET TO VIBRATE AND KIND OF MOVE A LITTLE BIT
h0w8WiVr6UY_8 0 SO THAT THEY CAN WORK OUT ANY STRESS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE
h0w8WiVr6UY_9 0 WHEN WE MAKE A BEAD WE'RE INTRODUCING LOTS OF FOCUSED HEAT INTO ONE PARTICULAR AND OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE THAT NOT BE SO LOCALIZED
h0w8WiVr6UY_10 0 BUT TO HAVE THE HEAT DISTRIBUTED EVENLY AND THERE ARE HOMOGENIZATION PROCESSES WE USE IN MAKING THE BREADS
h0w8WiVr6UY_11 0 WHERE WE DO A NICE KIND OF MARSHMALLOW TOASTING OF THE BEAD AFTER WE HAVE WORKED ON ONE DOT AREA OR ONE DESIGNING AREA
h0w8WiVr6UY_12 0 AND A LOT OF THIS WILL BECOME CLEAR AS WE GO THROUGH THE SEQUENCES OF THE ACTUAL BEAD MAKING STEPS
h0w8WiVr6UY_13 0 BUT IN ANY EVENT THE ANNEALING KILN IS A FURTHER HOMOGENIZING INFLUENCE ON THE GLASS AND HELPS ENSURE THAT THE GLASS BEAD THAT YOU MAKE ONCE IT COMES DOWN TO ROOM TEMPERATURE WILL NOT CRACK
h0w8WiVr6UY_14 0 THERE ARE SPECIAL KILNS MADE FOR THIS AND THEY ARE BEAD KILNS
h0w8WiVr6UY_15 0 A CERAMIC KILN CAN THEORETICALLY BE USED FOR MAKING A GLASS BEADS BUT YOU HAVE TO BE SUPER CAREFUL NOT TO INTRODUCE THE METAL ROD THAT YOU MAKE THE BEAD ON INTO ANY OF THE ELECTRIC ELEMENTS THAT ARE A PART OF THE KILN
h0w8WiVr6UY_16 0 BECAUSE IF YOU DO YOU STAND THE RISK OF ELECTROCUTING YOURSELF
h0w8WiVr6UY_17 0 SO A BEAD KILN WILL TYPICALLY HAVE A TOP CHAMBER WHERE THE ELECTRODES ARE DIRECT AND YOU NEVER WOULD TOUCH THAT WITH METAL DIRECTLY EXPOSED
h0w8WiVr6UY_18 0 BUT THERE'S A UNDERNEATH CHAMBER WHICH HAS USUALLY A MESH SEPARATION WHERE YOU PHYSICALLY CANNOT INTRODUCE THIS YOUR METAL MANDREL WHICH IS HOLDING YOUR BEAD TO AN ELECTRODE BY ACCIDENT
h0w8WiVr6UY_19 0 AND WE'LL GET YOU ANOTHER PICTURE OF THE BEAD KILN LATER ON YOU CAN SEE THE DOOR
h0w8WiVr6UY_20 0 BUT A BEAD KILN IS A GREAT TOOL AND THEY COST ANY WHERE FROM BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED DEGREES
h0w8WiVr6UY_21 0 SOME OF THEM HAVE DOLLARS EXCUSE ME SOME OF THEM HAVE CONTROLLERS WHICH AUTOMATICALLY ADJUST THE TEMPERATURE AND OTHERS JUST SIMPLY USE A VARIABLE SPEED SORT OF POTENTIOMETER DIAL AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING AT THE PYROMETER WHICH TELLS YOU WHAT TEMPERATURE YOU'RE AT
h0w8WiVr6UY_22 0 ON THE KILN I'M USING IT'S NOT FANCY WE HAVE NO PROGRAMMABLE COMPUTER IT DOESN'T KEEP IT AT A CERTAIN TEMPERATURE
h0w8WiVr6UY_23 0 I'M ALWAYS HAVING TO LOOK AT THE PYROMETER TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM MAINTAINING THE TEMPERATURE I WANT
h0w8WiVr6UY_24 0 IN THIS CASE RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT MY PYROMETER AND IT'S INDICATING IT'S HARD TO SEE OF COURSE BUT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT THAT'S ABOUT NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE SEVENTY-FIVE FAHRENHEIT
h0w8WiVr6UY_25 0 ONE THOUSAND IS STRAIGHT UP ON THAT MIDDLE SLASH
h0w8WiVr6UY_26 0 SO THAT'S THE PYROMETER AND THIS IS MY BEAD KILN AND AGAIN THESE ARE AVAILABLE FROM ANY OF THE GLASS SUPPLY HOUSES
h0w8WiVr6UY_27 0 WITH RESPECT TO THE KILN FUNCTION OF ANNEALING AND KEEPING THERMAL SHOCK AWAY THE PARTICULAR BEAD KILN I HAVE IN THIS INSTANCE ALSO SERVES A VERY VALUABLE SAFETY FUNCTION
h0w8WiVr6UY_28 0 BECAUSE THE BEAD WHEN IT GOES INTO THE KILN IT DOES NOT RISK GETTING INTO CONTACT WITH ELECTRODES THAT ARE LOCATED ABOVE BECAUSE THERE'S A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE UPPER CHAMBER AND THE BOTTOM CHAMBER
h0w8WiVr6UY_29 0 YOU'LL NOTICE THERE'S A MESH SCREEN SO YOU WOULD NEVER PUT A STEEL MANDREL INTO THIS TOP AREA BECAUSE IT CAN ELECTROCUTE YOU
h0w8WiVr6UY_30 0 BY TOUCHING THE MANDREL TO THE ELECTRODES YOU CAN GET A INJURING OR KILLING SHOCK
h0w8WiVr6UY_31 0 SO A BEAD KILN IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT AGAINST THIS AND HAS A SEPARATION SCREEN BETWEEN THE BEAD CHAMBER AND WHERE THE ELECTRODES ARE ACTUALLY LOCATED
GmSipqvuo3A_2 0 MY NAME IS NANCY ADLER AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY I'M GOING TO TELL YOU HOW TO OPERATE A CINEMA A MOVIE CINEMA
GmSipqvuo3A_3 0 WE ARE IN THE CONCESSION STAND
GmSipqvuo3A_4 0 THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE BUY POPCORN AND CANDY BEFORE THE SHOW
GmSipqvuo3A_5 0 WE HAVE TWO SIZES
GmSipqvuo3A_6 0 WE HAVE A SMALL BAG FOR THREE DOLLARS AND A LARGE BAG FOR FIVE DOLLARS AND WE ALSO HAVE SWEATSHIRTS THAT PEOPLE CAN BUY
GmSipqvuo3A_7 0 THEY MAKE GREAT SOUVENIRS OR CHRISTMAS GIFTS
GmSipqvuo3A_8 0 THEY SAY THE TINKER STREET ON THEM AND THEY'RE ONLY TWENTY DOLLARS
GmSipqvuo3A_9 0 THE CONCESSION STAND IS USUALLY VERY BUSY ESPECIALLY ON A SATURDAY NIGHT
GmSipqvuo3A_10 0 WE'RE LINKED ALSO TO THE TICKET BOOTH SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL YOU DON'T BUMP INTO THE CASHIER WHILE YOU'RE SELLING THE POPCORN
GrpCfdjXucE_2 0 I'M MICHAEL SETO
GrpCfdjXucE_3 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK MORE ABOUT MANAGING THE REFLECTIONS ON YOUR PIECE OF JEWELRY
GrpCfdjXucE_4 0 IN THE EARLIER CLIP WE TALKED ABOUT MANAGING THE REFLECTION FROM YOUR LIGHTS
GrpCfdjXucE_5 0 THE BEST WAY OF DOING THAT IS DEFUSING THEM EITHER IN A LIGHT TENT OR AS YOU SEE HERE WE'VE PUT SOME DIFFUSION MATERIAL ON TOP OF OUR LIGHTS SO THEY'RE NOT AS BRIGHT THEY'RE A LITTLE MORE EVEN
GrpCfdjXucE_6 0 THEN NEXT THING YOU WANT TO BE CONCERNED WITH AND LOOK AT IS WHAT OF THE SURROUNDINGS ARE BEING REFLECTED
GrpCfdjXucE_7 0 I CAN SEE PARTS OF THE ROOM HERE IN THE GLASS AS WELL AS ON THE STAINLESS STEEL OF THIS PARTICULAR WATCH
GrpCfdjXucE_8 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS BUILD OUR OWN LITTLE ENCLOSURE AROUND THIS TO MANAGE THE REFLECTIONS
GrpCfdjXucE_9 0 JUST TAKE AN A-CLAMP PUT IT ON A PIECE OF WHITE BOARD
GrpCfdjXucE_10 0 I'LL PUT THAT THERE TO MANAGE THE REFLECTIONS COMING OFF IN THE ROOM
GrpCfdjXucE_11 0 I'M NOT GOING TO USE THE GOLD REFLECTOR BECAUSE THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE APPROPRIATE FOR STAINLESS STEEL OR WHITE GOLD
GrpCfdjXucE_12 0 I'VE GOT SOME OTHER REFLECTORS HERE AGAIN SILVER ON ONE SIDE WHITE ON THE OTHER
GrpCfdjXucE_13 0 REALLY IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TRIAL AND ERROR HERE
GrpCfdjXucE_14 0 THE SILVER IS GOING TO BRING OUT THE COLOR OF THE METAL A LITTLE MORE INTENSELY
GrpCfdjXucE_15 0 IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE DEEPER AND DARKER
GrpCfdjXucE_16 0 IF YOU USE THE WHITE SIDE THE METAL IS GOING TO LOOK A LITTLE MORE GRAY AND A LITTLE MORE DEFUSED AS WELL
GrpCfdjXucE_17 0 SO IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF LOOK YOU'RE GOING FOR
GrpCfdjXucE_18 0 AFTER YOU'VE MANAGED ALL THE OTHER REFLECTIONS AND DEFUSE YOUR LIGHTS THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS HOW DO YOU MANAGE THE REFLECTION OF YOU AND THE CAMERA
GrpCfdjXucE_19 0 THAT OFTEN IS ONE OF THE MOST REVEALING REFLECTIONS WITHIN A PIECE OF REFLECTIVE JEWELRY
GrpCfdjXucE_20 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO MANAGE OUR OWN REFLECTION AND THAT OF THE CAMERA IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
GrpCfdjXucE_21 0 VERY SIMPLE A PIECE OF PAPER WITH A HOLE CUT INTO IT
GrpCfdjXucE_22 0 WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS JUST HOLD THAT OVER THE CAMERA WHEN YOU'RE SHOOTING AND YOU'RE BEHIND THAT AND IT'S REALLY ONLY GOING TO SHOW THE THE FRONT END OF THE LENS AND MINIMIZE ANY BLACK SPOTS ON THE REFLECTION
GrpCfdjXucE_23 0 SO AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE MANAGING THE REFLECTION ON YOUR JEWELRY YOU'RE GOING TO THINK ABOUT THE LIGHTS YOU'RE GOING TO THINK ABOUT THE SURROUNDINGS AND YOU'RE GOING TO THINK ABOUT MANAGING THE REFLECTION OF YOURSELF AND THE CAMERA
GdjjdhuOjeQ_1 0 DREW NOAH SO CONTINUING WITH THE PROJECT LIBRARY NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU ANOTHER USEFUL ITEM YOU CAN ADD AND WHAT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IS A LOCATION DESCRIPTION OR DETAILS
GdjjdhuOjeQ_2 0 OF COURSE TO ADD THIS IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME WAY
GdjjdhuOjeQ_3 0 CLICK THE ADD BUTTON I GET A LITTLE POP-UP
GdjjdhuOjeQ_4 0 CLICK LOCATION AND THEN YOU CAN WRITE NAME AND CHOOSE A FOLDER
GdjjdhuOjeQ_5 0 BUT JUST TO SHOW YOU I'M GOING TO PICK ONE THAT'S ALREADY ON THIS EXAMPLE
GdjjdhuOjeQ_6 0 AND THIS IS BASICALLY YOU TAKE A LOCATION IN YOUR SCRIPT AND THIS IS LIKE FROM A PRODUCTION STANDPOINT
GdjjdhuOjeQ_7 0 YOU PICK OUT WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO SHOOT THAT LOCATION
GdjjdhuOjeQ_8 0 AND THIS IS ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO SHOOT A PARTICULAR LOCATION IN THE SCRIPT AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE GOING FORWARD WITH THE PRODUCTION IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO ADD
GdjjdhuOjeQ_9 0 SO HERE'S THE LOCATION OLD FACTORY/EMERALD CITY
GdjjdhuOjeQ_10 0 AND THEN WE'VE GOT A DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL LOCATION
GdjjdhuOjeQ_11 0 IT'S AN OLD TOBACCO FACTORY
GdjjdhuOjeQ_12 0 AND THEN OVER HERE YOU CAN ADD SOME MEDIA
GdjjdhuOjeQ_13 0 THEY'VE GOT A PICTURE OF IT AND A MAP TO IT
GdjjdhuOjeQ_14 0 SO YOU GOT YOUR ADDRESS AND EVEN A LINK
GdjjdhuOjeQ_15 0 YOU CAN LINK TO THE MAP RIGHT HERE
GdjjdhuOjeQ_16 0 AND THEN BELOW THAT YOU HAVE THE SCOUTING AND SELECTION
GdjjdhuOjeQ_17 0 SO YOU'VE GOT SCOUTED FOR SCENES AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE SCENE THAT IS IN AND THEY'VE EVEN GOT THIS COOL LITTLE PICKLIST RIGHT HERE SO YOU CAN ADD ALL THE SCENES THAT THIS LOCATION IS AT
GdjjdhuOjeQ_18 0 ANY SCENES THAT ARE TAKEN STRAIGHT FROM YOUR SCREENPLAY YOU'VE WRITTEN IN CELTX
GdjjdhuOjeQ_19 0 AND THEN YOU'VE GOT SELECTED FOR SCENES
GdjjdhuOjeQ_20 0 SO YOU CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN SCOUTED FOR CERTAIN SCENES OR SELECTED FOR SCENES AND IT WORKS THE SAME WAY
GdjjdhuOjeQ_21 0 IT'S GOT A PICKLIST RIGHT HERE
GdjjdhuOjeQ_22 0 AGAIN I CAN MINIMIZE THIS IF I WANT
GdjjdhuOjeQ_23 0 THEN YOU'VE GOT THE CONTACT INFORMATION OF THE LOCATION PROBABLY VERY IMPORTANT TO FILL THIS OUT ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE COLLABORATING IN YOUR CELTX PROJECT MAYBE ONE PERSON GRABS HIS CONTACT INFORMATION AND PUTS IT RIGHT HERE AND THEN EVERYBODY COULD SEE IT
GdjjdhuOjeQ_24 0 AND THEN YOU'VE GOT SOME ACTUAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PHYSICAL LOCATION DATES AVAILABLE SQUARE FOOTAGE
GdjjdhuOjeQ_25 0 IS THERE AN ELEVATOR
GdjjdhuOjeQ_26 0 THE RENTAL COST VERY IMPORTANT
GdjjdhuOjeQ_27 0 POWER CAPABILITIES ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING LIGHT SOURCES NOISE ISSUES WASHROOM LOCATIONS PARKING INFORMATION AND JUST BASIC COMMENTS
GdjjdhuOjeQ_28 0 SO YOU CAN SEE MAYBE SOME THINGS THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT LIKE NOISE ISSUES
GdjjdhuOjeQ_29 0 THEY ALREADY GOT ALL THESE THINGS WRITTEN OUT FOR IF MAYBE YOU'RE NEW TO PRODUCTION YOU WOULDN'T THINK TO THINK ABOUT LIGHT SOURCES OR NOISE ISSUES OR PARKING INFORMATION
GdjjdhuOjeQ_30 0 AND CELTX HAS ALL THESE USEFUL THINGS KIND OF IN THESE LITTLE BOXES SO YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT AND YOU CAN FIGURE THIS OUT AND FILL THIS OUT
GdjjdhuOjeQ_31 0 AND IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCED IN PRODUCTION YOU KNOW THAT THESE ARE IMPORTANT AND THEY'RE JUST ALL RIGHT HERE IN A CONVENIENT LOCATION
GdjjdhuOjeQ_32 0 SO THAT'S HOW YOU ADD A IT'S CALLED A LOCATION PROFILE OR A DESCRIPTION OF A PHYSICAL LOCATION THAT IS A LOCATION IN YOUR SCREENPLAY
GdjjdhuOjeQ_33 0 SO THAT'S THE LOCATION PROFILE ITEM THAT YOU CAN ADD TO YOUR PROJECT LIBRARY
hImkZKnL3Zk_1 0 THE NEXT THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS SOME VALENTINES THAT YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR KID
hImkZKnL3Zk_2 0 THEY WILL NEED SOME SUPER VISION BECAUSE WE WILL BE DOING SOME HEAT EMBOSSING BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY'LL ENJOY DOING WITH YOU HELPING THEM
hImkZKnL3Zk_3 0 FOR KID'S VALENTINE'S I LIKE TO MAKE THESE CUTE 3X3 VALENTINES
hImkZKnL3Zk_4 0 THEY COME WITH THEIR OWN ENVELOPES
hImkZKnL3Zk_5 0 SOMETHING THAT KIDS REALLY LIKE TO DO IS EMBOSS AND STAMP ON THE BACK OF THEIR ENVELOPE SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO TOGETHER ALSO
hImkZKnL3Zk_6 0 THE FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO IS TAKE OUR 12X12 PIECE OF PAPER AND GO AHEAD AND CUT IT FOR THESE 3X3 CARDS
hImkZKnL3Zk_7 0 THE FIRST THING I'M GOING TO DO IS CUT IT AT SIX INCHES AND THEN GO AHEAD AND CUT THEM AT THREE
hImkZKnL3Zk_8 0 WHAT'S NICE ABOUT USING A 12X12 PIECE OF PAPER TO MAKE THESE CUTE LITTLE CARDS IS YOU CAN GET EIGHT CARDS OUT OF ONE PIECE OF PAPER
hImkZKnL3Zk_9 0 THAT IS REALLY A GOOD DEAL
hImkZKnL3Zk_10 0 MAKING CARDS WITH YOUR FAMILY IS NICE
hImkZKnL3Zk_11 0 YOU GET TO DO SOMETHING TOGETHER
hImkZKnL3Zk_12 0 IT'S A REALLY FUN ACTIVITY

hImkZKnL3Zk_14 0 I'VE GOT ALL MY CARDSTOCK CUT
hImkZKnL3Zk_15 0 THE NEXT THING I'M GOING TO DO IS JUST SCORE ALL OF THESE AT THREE INCHES FOLD THEM IN HALF AND YOU'RE READY TO GO AND MAKE YOUR DESIGNS ON THESE CUTE 3X3 CARDS
g7U59bTbBVs_1 0 THIS IS ROBERT STEWART WITH HILL13.COM
g7U59bTbBVs_2 0 WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT HERE TO YOU MAY LOOK LIKE A BUNCH OF PILES OF DIRT BUT THIS IS OUR NEWEST FEATURED FIELD THIS IS ARMAGEDDON
g7U59bTbBVs_3 0 WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT IS ABOUT 3/4 OF AN ACRE COVERED WITH HUGE PILES OF STONE AND EARTH AND MOUNDS
g7U59bTbBVs_4 0 DEEP INSIDE IT ARE TWO SLIT WWI TRENCHES THAT FACE ONE ANOTHER AT WHAT WE AFFECTIONATELY CALL THE KILL BOX
g7U59bTbBVs_5 0 MOST OF THE GAMES PLAYED HERE ARE PURE ELIMINATION AND AS WE FINISH BUILDING THIS FIELD IT IS GOING TO HAVE WRECKED VEHICLES AND OTHER BUILDING DEBRIS SO IT WILL LOOK LIKE A NUCLEAR WAR OCCURRED HERE
g7U59bTbBVs_6 0 THIS SO FAR IS THE ROUGHEST PLAYING FIELD THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT COME TO HILL THIRTEEN HAVE EVER SEEN AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE VERY PROUD OF IT
g7U59bTbBVs_7 0 THERE IS NO OTHER SPEED BALL COURSE OR MOGUL'S COURSE LIKE IT THAT WE CAN FIND ANYWHERE AND ONCE IT IS FINISHED IT WILL BE PROBABLY THE HARDEST COURSE IN CENTRAL TEXAS TO PLAY
g7U59bTbBVs_8 0 MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO PLAY HERE GET HEAD SHOT BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A LOT OF COVER
GD4d-f-mp9I_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS CRAIG MORRELL
GD4d-f-mp9I_2 0 I'M WITH LANDSCAPE RESTORATIONS IN MIAMI FLORIDA
GD4d-f-mp9I_3 0 WE'RE HERE AT PALM HAMMOCK ORCHID ESTATE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PLANTING AND FERTILIZING
GD4d-f-mp9I_4 0 THE TITLE OF THIS CLIP IS TO BUILD YOURSELF A DAM
GD4d-f-mp9I_5 0 NOW I'M NOT REFERRING TO THE HOOVER DAM OR THE GRAND COULEE A DAM AROUND YOUR PLANTS
GD4d-f-mp9I_6 0 THE IDEA ABOUT THIS IS TO KEEP THE WATER CENTERED ON THE PLANT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE WORKING ON A SLOPE LIKE THIS ONE
GD4d-f-mp9I_7 0 SO WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS RIGHT AFTER WE'VE PLANTED OUR PLANT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OURSELVES A LITTLE EARTHEN DAM A FEW INCHES DEEP SO THAT THE WATER THAT WE PUT IN HERE AT THE BASE OF THE PLANT STAYS HERE
GD4d-f-mp9I_8 0 IT'LL SOAK DOWN INTO THE ROOT BALL DEEP AND SLOW
GD4d-f-mp9I_9 0 THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY WITH PALMS AND LARGER TREES
GD4d-f-mp9I_10 0 YOU CAN BUILD A DAM THAT MIGHT BE FOUR OR FIVE FEET ACROSS AND FOOT TALL TO HOLD A SMALL LAKE OF WATER
GD4d-f-mp9I_11 0 SO ONCE WE GET THIS BUILT OUR WATER STAYS RIGHT WHERE WE WANT IT TO RIGHT HERE
GD4d-f-mp9I_12 0 SO ALL WE'RE GOING TO DO IS TAKE THE BACK FILL AND MAKE OURSELVES A LITTLE EARTHEN DAM
GndDItpzJOo_1 0 HOW TO MASTER THE OVER TECHNIQUE
GndDItpzJOo_2 0 LIKE ANYTHING WE DO IN OUR PERSONAL LIVES OR OUR DOG LIVES ROUTINE AND REPETITION COMMITMENT AND DEDICATION WILL PREVAIL
GndDItpzJOo_3 0 AS I'VE MENTIONED IN EARLIER SEGMENTS THINK ABOUT YOUR WALK WITH YOUR DOG AS BEING AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICE AGILITY
GndDItpzJOo_4 0 HERE YOU HAVE SEEN AN OVER OBSTACLE SO ON YOUR NEXT WALK WITH YOUR DOG CONSIDER THINGS IN YOUR LOCAL PARK WHETHER ITS A BENCH A FALLEN TREE LIMB OR ANYTHING SIT OR ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN USE FOR AN OVER COMMAND
GndDItpzJOo_5 0 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE SAME HEIGHT VARYING HEIGHT WILL BE GOOD SO YOUR DOG TRULY NEVER KNOWS WHAT TO EXPECT WITH THE NEXT OVER COMMAND
GndDItpzJOo_6 0 SO TO SUMMARIZE ROUTINE REPETITION COMMITMENT AND DEDICATION WILL ULTIMATELY TEACH YOUR DOG THE OVER COMMAND
GndDItpzJOo_7 0 THEREFORE WHEN YOU GET TO COMPETITION ANY WIDTH OR HEIGHT OF STICK WILL BE A LOT EASIER FOR YOUR DOG TO MASTER
HEQ9KoTGaM4_1 0 ALL RIGHT NOW HERE WE GO SYNCOPATION
HEQ9KoTGaM4_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING THE RIDE CYMBAL SYNCOPATION
HEQ9KoTGaM4_3 0 THIS IS GOING TO BE OUR DRIVING FORCE ON THE ON THIS GROOVE
HEQ9KoTGaM4_4 0 IT'S GOING TO BE BURNING
HEQ9KoTGaM4_5 0 WE'RE JUST GOING TO KEEP IT UP THERE
HEQ9KoTGaM4_6 0 IT'S GOING TO BE PLAYED ALL EIGHTH NOTES ONE AND TWO AND THREE AND FOUR AND
HEQ9KoTGaM4_7 0 ONE AND TWO AND THREE AND FOUR AND ONE AND TWO AND THREE AND FOUR AND
HEQ9KoTGaM4_8 0 THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE REALLY A LOT OF ACCENTS THERE
HEQ9KoTGaM4_9 0 IT'S JUST GOING TO KEEP GROOVING AWAY ON IT
HEQ9KoTGaM4_11 0 NO ACCENTS ON ANYTHING JUST STRAIGHT
HEQ9KoTGaM4_14 0 SO THAT'S GOING TO BE OUR DRIVER AND THE YOU KNOW AND THE ARM AND THE LEG OF THIS GROOVE
HEQ9KoTGaM4_16 0 IT'S GOING TO PUSH THIS GROOVE FORWARD AND WHATNOT AND IT'S GOING TO BE THE ONE THAT'S YOU KNOW KIND OF GET UP AND MAKE EVERYBODY DANCE
HEQ9KoTGaM4_18 0 SO THIS IS GOING TO BE THE SOUND OF IT
HEQ9KoTGaM4_19 0 AND I CAN MOVE THAT ANYWHERE
HEQ9KoTGaM4_20 0 I CAN MOVE THAT TO THE BODY OF THE CYMBAL OR YOU CAN KEEP IT ON THE BELL
HEQ9KoTGaM4_21 0 OR I CAN ALTERNATE
G5JmKsIULig_1 0 JUST A COUPLE MORE THINGS I THINK WILL BE IMPORTANT TO SHARE WITH YOU BEFORE WE GET STARTED
G5JmKsIULig_2 0 BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE FULLY PREPARED YOU KNOW THAT EVERYTHING HAS BEEN COVERED
G5JmKsIULig_3 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ALL OF THESE THINGS I'M SUGGESTING BUT THESE ARE PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING YOU WOULD NEED TO CONSIDER TO CLEAN A BATHROOM TO CLEAN A SHOWER AND A BATHTUB
G5JmKsIULig_4 0 CERTAINLY YOU WANT TO USE GLOVES OKAY
G5JmKsIULig_5 0 THESE ACTUALLY ARE LATEX FREE SOME PEOPLE ARE ALLERGIC TO LATEX SO THESE COME ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY IN A BOX
G5JmKsIULig_6 0 IT'S ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE DOLLARS YOU CAN GET THIS ANY PLACE YOU KNOW RITE-AID OR SIMILAR PLACES
G5JmKsIULig_7 0 THESE ARE DISPOSABLE OBVIOUSLY SO EVERY TIME YOU USE THESE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU THROW THESE OUT
G5JmKsIULig_8 0 DON'T KEEP THESE
G5JmKsIULig_9 0 WE HAVE ALSO THE LATEX GLOVES RIGHT HERE
G5JmKsIULig_10 0 WHICH I PREFER
G5JmKsIULig_11 0 SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO JUST THROW THEM OUT EVERY TIME

G5JmKsIULig_13 0 THEY COVER YOUR ARMS HIGHER I DON'T LIKE TO GET SPLASHES UP MY ARMS
G5JmKsIULig_14 0 AND THEY'RE ALSO GOT A NICE SOFT INSIDE THEY'RE VERY COMFORTABLE
G5JmKsIULig_15 0 BUT THEY'RE DURABLE YOU CAN USE THE TWENTY THIRTY TIMES OVER
G5JmKsIULig_16 0 AS LONG AS YOU DISINFECT THE OUTSIDE WHEN YOU'RE DONE BEFORE YOU PUT THEM BACK IN YOUR CARRIER OKAY
G5JmKsIULig_17 0 SO THERE'S YOUR OPTIONS FOR YOUR GLOVES
HFrHP8bZWCQ_1 0 NOW I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT YEARS THESE BALLOON TIRE BICYCLES WERE PRODUCED
HFrHP8bZWCQ_2 0 THE CURRENT THINKING IS SCHWINN CAME OUT WITH THE FIRST BALLOON TIRE BICYCLE IN 1934
HFrHP8bZWCQ_3 0 THEY CONTRACTED WITH A TIRE COMPANY WHO HAD A PRODUCT
HFrHP8bZWCQ_4 0 THE PRODUCT WAS A WIDER SOFTER TIRE AND SCHWINN HAD TO ORDER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THESE TIRES AND THEY HAD TO BUILD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THESE VINTAGE BICYCLES TO SATISFY THE DEMAND AND CREATE THESE BICYCLES
HFrHP8bZWCQ_5 0 THEY BUILT THE BICYCLES AND THEY WERE HUGELY POPULAR AND IT TOOK OFF FROM THERE
HFrHP8bZWCQ_6 0 SHORTLY AFTER COLUMBIA WHO ALSO BUILT WESTFIELD'S HUFFMAN WHO USED TO BUILD THE BRAND TODAY IS CALLED HUFFY COLSON MERCURY ALL THESE DIFFERENT BRANDS STARTED BUILDING THESE BALLOON TIRE BICYCLES AND THEY BECAME VERY POPULAR AND THEY CONTINUED ON
HFrHP8bZWCQ_7 0 THROUGH WORLD WAR II NOT MANY WERE PRODUCED
HFrHP8bZWCQ_8 0 IT'S ALWAYS VERY HARD TO FIND A BIKE MADE DURING WORLD WAR II BECAUSE MATERIALS WERE USED FOR OTHER THINGS AND THEY KIND OF TAILED OFF
HFrHP8bZWCQ_9 0 COMPANIES STOPPED MAKING THEM AND THEY MOVED TO WHAT'S CALLED THE MIDDLEWEIGHT BICYCLE GENERALLY AROUND 1953 OR SO
Gj2C93et0_c_1 0 HI I'M LISA GOLDSWORTHY WITH ACE CARPET AND UPHOLSTERY CARE IN DENVER COLORADO AND IN THIS SEGMENT I'M GOING TO DISCUSS THINGS TO AVOID WHEN YOU HAVE A SPILL ON YOUR CARPET
Gj2C93et0_c_2 0 SO THIS IS BASICALLY THE DON'TS NEVER DO ANY OF THESE PRACTICES THAT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU BUT UNFORTUNATELY I'VE BEEN GUILTY OF IT
Gj2C93et0_c_3 0 I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF THESE THINGS WHICH I'LL GO OVER WITH YOU WHEN WE GET TO THAT POINT
Gj2C93et0_c_4 0 SO IN THIS EXAMPLE I'M GOING TO USE A GLASS OF WINE RED WINE AS YOU CAN SEE
Gj2C93et0_c_5 0 ALRIGHT SO LET'S TAKE THIS WINE AND WE'RE GOING TO GO FOR THE DEADLY SPILL
Gj2C93et0_c_6 0 ALRIGHT YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT RED WINE SPILL WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE CARPET WHICH A SPILL WILL
Gj2C93et0_c_7 0 IT WILL GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE CARPET AND INTO THE CARPET PAD WHICH WE'LL DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT HERE LATER
Gj2C93et0_c_8 0 BUT LET'S TACKLE THE SPILL
Gj2C93et0_c_9 0 ALRIGHT SO YOU'RE PANICKED YOU'VE GOT THE RED WINE SPILL
Gj2C93et0_c_10 0 FIRST THING YOU DO YOU GRAB THE CLOSEST AVAILABLE TOWEL AND YOU START SCRUBBING OH MY GOSH I'VE GOT TO GET THE RED WINE OUT OF MY CARPET
Gj2C93et0_c_11 0 AND SCRUB YOU KNOW IT'S PUT MORE ELBOW GREASE INTO IT RIGHT ISN'T THAT WHAT OUR MOM ALWAYS TAUGHT US
Gj2C93et0_c_12 0 THAT'S WHAT I WAS ALWAYS USED TO DO SCRUB SCRUB SCRUB
Gj2C93et0_c_13 0 WELL THIS ISN'T WORKING AT ALL
Gj2C93et0_c_14 0 MAYBE IF I PUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ELBOW GREASE INTO IT IT WILL COME OUT SCRUB IT REALLY GOOD
Gj2C93et0_c_15 0 WELL NO THAT'S NOT GOOD
Gj2C93et0_c_16 0 THAT'S NOT GOOD
Gj2C93et0_c_17 0 AND I'M USING A BLACK TOWEL THAT'S NOT GOOD EITHER
Gj2C93et0_c_18 0 WELL I HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANY GOOD RESULTS AT ALL
Gj2C93et0_c_19 0 IN FACT IF YOU SEE THE AREA I SCRUBBED LOOKS A LITTLE FUZZY NOW
Gj2C93et0_c_20 0 I WONDER WHY THAT IS
Gj2C93et0_c_21 0 WELL SCRUBBING WILL DAMAGE YOUR CARPET FIBER AND THIS IS A BRAND NEW REMNANT OF CARPET AND JUST THAT SMALL AMOUNT OF SCRUBBING I DID ALREADY DAMAGED THIS CARPET TO THIS AMOUNT

GSdywZYtP3g_1 0 HI I'M AMELIA AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO REMOVE STATIC FROM THE HAIR
GSdywZYtP3g_2 0 WHAT CAUSES STATIC IS DRYNESS FROM THE ENVIRONMENT
GSdywZYtP3g_3 0 SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE USING A QUALITY CONDITIONER AT HOME OR EVEN A LEAVE IN CONDITIONER ON TOP OF THAT IF YOU'RE REALLY HAVING AN ISSUE WITH STATIC ON A REGULAR BASIS
GSdywZYtP3g_4 0 FINE HAIR DOES TEND TO ATTRACT IT MORE THAN COARSER HAIR
GSdywZYtP3g_6 0 I DON'T KNOW
GSdywZYtP3g_7 0 THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS
GSdywZYtP3g_8 0 SO WHEN YOU'VE GOT STATIC GOING ON YOU CAN TRY A LITTLE BIT OF WATER AND JUST SPRAY IT
GSdywZYtP3g_9 0 AND WHAT THAT WILL DO THAT'LL ADD THE MOISTURE BACK INTO THE HAIR AND COMB IT DOWN
GSdywZYtP3g_10 0 ANOTHER THING THAT WORKS WELL IS HAIR SPRAY
GSdywZYtP3g_11 0 AGAIN YOU JUST LIGHTLY SPRAY
GSdywZYtP3g_12 0 ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO BASICALLY ADD MOISTURE BACK INTO THE HAIR
GSdywZYtP3g_13 0 A DRYER SHEET WORKS WELL EVEN THOUGH I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THAT ACTUALLY IS A MYTH AND DOESN'T WORK THAT WELL
GSdywZYtP3g_14 0 BUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING TO WORK THE BEST IS YOUR WATER YOUR HAIRSPRAY
GSdywZYtP3g_15 0 YOU CAN ALSO WHEN YOUR BRUSH TENDS TO ATTRACT A LOT OF STATIC YOU CAN IN THE WINTER LIGHTLY SPRAY YOUR BRUSH WITH SOME HAIRSPRAY
GSdywZYtP3g_16 0 ANOTHER GOOD THING THAT WORKS REALLY WELL IS STATIC GUARD WHICH WE ALL KNOW FROM USING ON OUR SKIRTS WITH HOSE
GSdywZYtP3g_17 0 YOU JUST SPRAY A LITTLE BIT ON YOUR BRUSH OR A LITTLE BIT ON YOUR HAIR AND THAT'LL DEFINITELY GET RID OF THE STATIC
GSdywZYtP3g_18 0 SO JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU USE A CONDITIONER IN THE SHOWER AFTER YOU SHAMPOO SOMETHING LIGHT THAT DE-TANGLES AND IF IT'S REALLY BAD A LEAVE IN CONDITIONER BEFORE YOU STYLE AND THEN AGAIN YOU CAN TRY A STATIC GUARD HAIRSPRAY WATER
GSdywZYtP3g_19 0 JUST REMEMBER YOU NEED TO ADD MOISTURE BACK INTO THE ENVIRONMENT
GSdywZYtP3g_20 0 YOU CAN EVEN KEEP A HUMIDIFIER RUNNING AT ALL TIMES AND THAT WILL HELP TOO BECAUSE STATIC DOES TEND TO HAPPEN IN THE WINTER WHEN THINGS ARE A LOT DRYER
GSdywZYtP3g_21 0 SO BY USING THOSE ITEMS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET STATIC CONTROL
g96fjOVkQC4_1 0 LET'S TRY A FOLKLORIC MOVE CALLED THE HIP PULL
g96fjOVkQC4_2 0 WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE IS THE HIPS ARE GOING TO MOVE STRAIGHT BACK IN A HORIZONTAL FASHION AND BECAUSE THE HIP COMES BACK THE FOOT IS GOING TO RELEASE
g96fjOVkQC4_3 0 YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO TURN IT INTO A KICK
g96fjOVkQC4_4 0 YOU WANT THE FOOT TO COME NATURALLY OFF THE FLOOR
g96fjOVkQC4_5 0 LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FIRST AND I WILL BREAK IT DOWN
g96fjOVkQC4_6 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO PULL IT BACK AND PUT OUR WEIGHT FRONT
g96fjOVkQC4_7 0 PULL IT BACK FRONT
g96fjOVkQC4_8 0 PULL AND FRONT
g96fjOVkQC4_11 0 SO THIS IS THE MOVEMENT YOU WANT
g96fjOVkQC4_12 0 SO AS YOU COME BACK YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE BRINGING YOUR POPO BACK AND YOU WANT YOUR BACK SPINE AND EVEN LIKE YOU BECOME ONE MOVE ONE PIECE FROM YOUR SHOULDERS TO YOUR HIPS
g96fjOVkQC4_13 0 SO AS IF SOMEBODY HAS THEIR ARMS AROUND YOU OR ROPE AROUND YOUR HIPS AND THEY'RE GOING TO PULL YOU STRAIGHT BACK IN LIKE WOOH LIKE THAT
g96fjOVkQC4_14 0 SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR BACK FOOT NICE AND ANCHORED AND SO YOU'RE GOING TO PULL IT IN
g96fjOVkQC4_15 0 OR IMAGINE A PIECE OF ICE GOING DOWN THE FRONT OF YOUR SHIRT AND YOU'RE LIKE WOOH
g96fjOVkQC4_16 0 YOU DON'T WANT IT TO TOUCH YOUR SKIN AND GO OUT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SHIRT
g96fjOVkQC4_17 0 SO PULL AND PRESS PULL BACK AND PRESS
g96fjOVkQC4_18 0 NOW THE FOOT IS JUST GOING TO BE VERY RELAX YOU'RE NOT GOING TO REALLY TRY TO DO MUCH WITH IT AT ALL
g96fjOVkQC4_19 0 YOU WANT TO KEEP THE TOE KIND OF POINTED BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO PULL OUT EFFORT INTO IT AT ALL
g96fjOVkQC4_20 0 YOU WANT TO LOOK VERY NATURAL
g96fjOVkQC4_21 0 THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA WITH FOLKLORIC MOVE
g96fjOVkQC4_22 0 SO PRACTICE THAT IN THE MIRROR
g_outmX78pU_1 0 DOWNLOADING MUSIC IS A GREAT WAY TO GET MUSIC
g_outmX78pU_2 0 UNFORTUNATELY IT TAKES AWAY THE AMBIANCE OF GOING TO THE RECORD STORE THE CD STORE THUMBING THROUGH THE THINGS LOOKING IN THE CLOSE-OUT BIN

g_outmX78pU_5 0 WELL SINCE THE IPOD USES ITUNES AS THE PROXY AND PROTOCOL FOR LOADING AND UNLOADING THINGS IN AND OUT OF YOUR ITUNES ALL THAT FANCY WORDS MEANS THIS IS THAT IT HELPS YOU DECIDE WHAT GOES IN OR COMES OUT OF YOUR IPOD
g_outmX78pU_6 0 SO TO DOWNLOAD MUSIC YOU'VE GOT ONE OF TWO CHOICES
g_outmX78pU_7 0 YOU GO DIRECTLY TO THE ITUNES STORE LISTED UNDER STORE RIGHT HERE IN YOUR ITUNES INTERFACE CHOOSE OR SEARCH YOUR FAVORITE MUSIC PUT IN YOUR CREDIT CARD UNLESS THEY HAVE A FREE OFFERING WHICH THEY DO FROM TIME TO TIME OR YOUR GIFT CARD AND BOOYAH

g_outmX78pU_11 0 THAT'S HOW THEY GET CHA
g_outmX78pU_12 0 THEY MAKE IT EASY
g_outmX78pU_14 0 BETTER SERVICE THAT'S HOW THE ECONOMY WORKS

g_outmX78pU_26 0 I'M ROKOSZ YOUR DIGITAL LIFESTYLE EXPERT SAYING STREAM YA LATER
GHocQ-7zyOo_1 0 NOW WE ARE GOING TO DO A DIFFERENT SERVE WHICH IS THE WIDE SERVE SO MY GOAL IS TO HIT THE BALL SOMEWHERE ABOVE MY RACQUET TO NEAR THE RED LINE AND THE REASON BEING WHEN THE BALL HITS IN THAT AREA THE OPPONENT DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF A SHOT
GHocQ-7zyOo_2 0 HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THE BALL OFF THE WALL OR HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET IT BEFORE IT HITS THE WALL SO IF I HIT IT JUST RIGHT HE IS GOING TO HAVE A VERY VERY WEAK SHOT
GHocQ-7zyOo_3 0 I MOST LIKELY AM GOING TO USE Y SIDE ARM SERVE ON THIS ONE AND I JUST HIT IT AND THAT WASN'T AS GOOD AS I WOULD LIKE ALMOST PERFECT THERE WE GO
GHocQ-7zyOo_4 0 RIGHT LIKE THAT SO BY KEEPING THE BALL AT THAT PART OF THE WALL THEY CAN'T ATTACK ME VERY MUCH SO I'LL USE THE BIG BALL
GHocQ-7zyOo_5 0 SO BY HITTING THE BALL UP HERE MY OPPONENT IS FORCED TO TAKE THE BALL HIGH WITH HIS BACK HAND OR HE HAS TO TAKE THE RISK OF LETTING IT COME OFF THE BACK WALL OR DYING BACK HERE SO THIS IS A VERY VERY EFFECTIVE SHOT SO ONCE YOU HAVE MASTERED THE TECHNICAL SKILLS OF JUST HITTING THE BALL IN A DECENT MANNER YOU WANT TO START INCORPORATING HITTING IT TO SPOTS ON THE SIDE OF THE WALL TO MAKE YOUR SERVE THAT MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE
GMxkIK6Jrmo_1 0 NOW WE ARE GOING TO FOLD THIS POINT INTO THE CENTER BUT PARALLEL THE CREASE WILL BE PARALLEL TO THE CENTER LIKE THIS
GMxkIK6Jrmo_2 0 POINT TO THE CENTER THE CREASE IS PARALLEL TO THE CENTER CREASE

HjvIFzsKO-M_1 0 A MEDICAL SCIENTIST IS TYPICALLY A BIOLOGIST WHO IS STUDYING THE PROCESSES OF LIFE AND USUALLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND A DISEASE OR A CONDITION THAT COULD BE TRANSLATED INTO MEDICINE OR MEDICAL PRACTICE
HjvIFzsKO-M_2 0 SOMETIMES THERE'S DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF MEDICAL SCIENTISTS
HjvIFzsKO-M_3 0 I'M PERSONALLY PEOPLE WOULD CALL ME A PHYSICIAN SCIENTIST BECAUSE I BECAME A MEDICAL DOCTOR OR PHYSICIAN FIRST AND THEN ALSO DID SCIENTIFIC TRAINING
HjvIFzsKO-M_4 0 BUT THERE ARE ALSO PHD SCIENTISTS WHO BECOME BIOLOGISTS AND GET INTERESTED IN MEDICINE AND THEY DON'T DO PATIENT CARE AT ALL
HjvIFzsKO-M_5 0 IN FACT THERE ARE SOME VETERINARIANS OR EVEN DENTISTS WHO GO IN AND DO MEDICAL SCIENCE IN THEIR AREAS
HjvIFzsKO-M_6 0 MOST OF THE MONEY THAT COMES TO MEDICAL SCIENTISTS TO DO THE WORK COMES FROM THE GOVERNMENT OR FOUNDATIONS
HjvIFzsKO-M_7 0 SO THE INSTITUTION THAT HIRES YOU DOESN'T REALLY PAY YOU IN A WAY
HjvIFzsKO-M_8 0 YOU HAVE TO RAISE YOUR OWN SALARY
HjvIFzsKO-M_9 0 SO THE BIG PART OF WHAT WE DO IS WRITING GRANTS
HjvIFzsKO-M_10 0 WE HAVE COLLABORATORS ALL OVER THE WORLD
HjvIFzsKO-M_11 0 SO WHILE WE'RE SLEEPING OTHER PEOPLE IN EUROPE ARE WORKING
HjvIFzsKO-M_12 0 SO TYPICALLY I'LL HAVE A NUMBER OF EMAILS IN THE MORNING
HjvIFzsKO-M_13 0 THEN I WOULD GET HERE TO WORK AND ESSENTIALLY I'M A MANAGER OF SCIENTIFIC PERSONNEL NOW AS I RUN A LAB
HjvIFzsKO-M_14 0 SO THERE ARE BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY PEOPLE IN MY LAB
HjvIFzsKO-M_15 0 SO TYPICALLY I WOULD HAVE MEETINGS ALL DAY WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK
HjvIFzsKO-M_16 0 I'M JUST MORE OF A CHEERLEADER TRYING TO HELP THEM DO THEIR WORK
HjvIFzsKO-M_17 0 SO I WOULD HAVE A MEETING WITH A SMALL GROUP OF TWO OR THREE PEOPLE HERE AT THE TABLE GOING OVER DATA
HjvIFzsKO-M_18 0 THEN I MIGHT MEET WITH AN ADMINISTRATOR TO GO OVER BUDGETS AND THEN I MIGHT MEET WITH SOME TRAINEES ABOUT A COMMITTEE AND THEN MORE DATA
HjvIFzsKO-M_19 0 TYPICALLY IT'S MEETINGS FOR ME DURING THE DAY AND THEN I MIGHT DO A COUPLE OF HOURS ON THE COMPUTER WHILE I'M HERE GO HOME
HjvIFzsKO-M_20 0 I TYPICALLY GET HOME ABOUT SEVENISH HAVE DINNER WITH MY FAMILY AND THEN I MIGHT WORK FROM NINE UNTIL THREE IN THE MORNING ON MY LAPTOP IN BED OR ON THE SOFA OR SOMETHING
HjvIFzsKO-M_21 0 SO THERE'S A LOT OF TYPING WRITING COMMUNICATING WITH PEOPLE
HjvIFzsKO-M_22 0 WELL THERE'S DIFFERENT SORT OF VENUES THAT YOU CAN DO THIS TYPE OF WORK
HjvIFzsKO-M_23 0 I WORK IN AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER IN A UNIVERSITY A UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER SO MY JOB NOT ONLY INVOLVES RESEARCH BUT I ALSO DO A LOT OF TEACHING
HjvIFzsKO-M_25 0 I TEACH IN SMALL GROUP SETTINGS
HjvIFzsKO-M_26 0 I MENTOR A LOT OF SCIENTISTS IN MY LAB WHO ARE GETTING PHDS OR WHO ALREADY HAVE A PHD AND ARE GETTING A POSTDOCTORAL TRAINING AND THEN I'LL ALSO SEE PATIENTS
HjvIFzsKO-M_27 0 I'M A PEDIATRICIAN SO I'LL GO TO THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL AND SEE PATIENTS WITH INFECTIOUS DISEASES WHICH IS SOMEWHAT RELATED TO MY RESEARCH BUT BASICALLY IT'S ALMOST A SEPARATE JOB
HjvIFzsKO-M_28 0 SO THAT'S WHAT LIFE IS LIKE IN AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER
HjvIFzsKO-M_29 0 YOU COULD ALSO DO THIS TYPE OF WORK IN A COMPANY A FOR-PROFIT COMPANY IN WHICH I WOULDN'T BE SEEING PATIENTS OR TEACHING OR REALLY MENTORING
HjvIFzsKO-M_30 0 YOU'RE JUST THERE TO PUSH THE PROJECT THROUGH AS FAST AS YOU CAN AND THAT CAN HAVE IT'S ATTRACTIONS TOO
HjvIFzsKO-M_31 0 IT'S SIMPLER AND MORE DEFINED AND A LITTLE LESS CRAZY
HjvIFzsKO-M_32 0 BUT I LIKE THE BROADER MISSION OF RESEARCH EDUCATION AND PATIENT CARE
gZD8seYvhXA_1 0 HI I'M MARTI AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM I'M HERE TODAY TO SHOW YOU HOW TO USE AN IRON PATCH
gZD8seYvhXA_2 0 PATCHES HAVE BECOME POPULAR AGAIN
gZD8seYvhXA_3 0 THEY ARE WONDERFUL IF YOU HAVE A RIP IN YOUR JEANS OR PERHAPS A PART OF A JACKET
gZD8seYvhXA_4 0 THIS IS A PATCH THAT I PURCHASED AT A FABRIC STORE
gZD8seYvhXA_5 0 SOMETIMES YOUR CRAFT STORE AND SUPER DISCOUNT STORES WILL HAVE THEM AS WELL
gZD8seYvhXA_6 0 IT'S 100 %PERCENT COTTON BUT IT DOES HAVE A SPECIAL BACKING ON IT FOR IT TO ADHERE
gZD8seYvhXA_7 0 IT'S REAL SIMPLE TO USE
gZD8seYvhXA_8 0 YOU CAN ACTUALLY CUT IT TO FORM
gZD8seYvhXA_9 0 IF YOU LIKE TO YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE THE WHOLE THING
gZD8seYvhXA_10 0 YOU CAN ACTUALLY CUT PATTERNS MAYBE OUT OF A COOKIE CUTTER IF YOU WANTED THE STARS OR DIFFERENT SHAPES
gZD8seYvhXA_11 0 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT FOR THIS TO STICK YOU NEED TO HAVE A REALLY WARM SURFACE
gZD8seYvhXA_12 0 I'M USING A PIECE OF COTTON FABRIC HERE AND I'M GOING TO LAY MY IRON DOWN AND GIVE IT ABOUT TWENTY THIRTY SECONDS TILL IT'S WARM TO MY HAND AND I DON'T WANT TO PLACE MY HAND ON IT ANYMORE
GsKgVqt0Big_1 0 ALVIN DEDEAUX SO THAT STOP LOOKS LIKE THIS WITH YOUR ROD TIP
GsKgVqt0Big_2 0 AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE ROD IS LOADING UP
GsKgVqt0Big_3 0 I'M DOING MY POWER SNAP AND THEN I'D MAKE THAT ABRUPT STOP
GsKgVqt0Big_4 0 AND THE STOP IS ACTUALLY WHAT'S THROWING THE LINE OFF THE ROD TIP
GsKgVqt0Big_5 0 IF I DO IT AND I DON'T REALLY STOP I'M NOT REALLY PUTTING NEARLY AS MUCH POWER
GsKgVqt0Big_6 0 I'M DOING MY POWER SNAP WITH MY PAUSE AND EVERYTHING BUT IT'S REALLY THE STOP THAT THROWS THE LINE OFF THE ROD TIP
GsKgVqt0Big_7 0 AND THEN YOU JUST WANT TO PAUSE LONG ENOUGH FOR THAT LINE TO ALMOST COMPLETELY STRAIGHTEN OUT AND YOU START IT ALL OVER AGAIN
hEpfpWs11aI_1 0 HI THIS IS AARON HALE AT FITNESS FOR LIFE IN WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINE HERE TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF USING A TREADMILL
hEpfpWs11aI_2 0 THE BENEFITS OF USING A TREADMILL AS OPPOSE TO RUNNING AND WALKING OUTSIDE WHERE THE SURFACES THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE RUNNING ON ARE MUCH HARDER WITH ASPHALT AND CONCRETE
hEpfpWs11aI_3 0 TYPICALLY MOST MID TO UPPER GRADE TREADMILLS HAVE A CUSHIONING SYSTEM ON THE DECK THAT'S GOING TO HELP REDUCE THE IMPACT OF THE TREADMILL
hEpfpWs11aI_4 0 NUMBER TWO AND THIS IS A BIG ONE HERE WE'RE REALLY WITH THE BENEFITS OF THE TREADMILL WE'RE REALLY WORKING ON OUR CARDIOVASCULAR STRENGTH AND OUR OVERALL HEALTH
hEpfpWs11aI_5 0 SECONDLY IT'S A MUCH MORE UNLIKELY AND MUCH LOWER RISK OF INJURY USING A TREADMILL AS IT IS TO RUNNING OUTSIDE
hEpfpWs11aI_6 0 IN ADDITION TO THAT IT'S REALLY GOING TO HELP OUT OUR ENDURANCE
hEpfpWs11aI_7 0 OUR OVERALL HEALTH
hEpfpWs11aI_8 0 AND FOR ATHLETICS IN PARTICULAR YOU'RE REALLY YOU CAN REALLY USE A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF SPRINT TRAINING A LOT OF INTERVAL TRAINING ON A TREADMILL THAT TEND TO BE LIMITED TO AT TIMES OUTSIDE
hEpfpWs11aI_9 0 THERE ARE MANY OTHER MANY OTHER BENEFITS TO WORKING ON A TREADMILL BUT THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE HERE
hEpfpWs11aI_10 0 THIS HAS BEEN AARON AT FITNESS FOR LIFE IN WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA
hEpfpWs11aI_11 0 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
GpMoGDW3OPU_1 0 OK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BASIC SHOOTING MODES HERE AND NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO PORTRAIT MODE WITH THE 40D
GpMoGDW3OPU_2 0 TO SET THE CAMERA TO PORTRAIT MODE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS TAKE THIS MODE DIAL HERE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BACK SIDE OF THE CAMERA AND I'M JUST GOING TO SPIN IT FROM FULLY AUTOMATIC MODE TO PORTRAIT MODE
GpMoGDW3OPU_3 0 AND PORTRAIT MODE JUST HAS THIS LITTLE ICON OF A WOMAN'S FACE TO REPRESENT PORTRAITS
GpMoGDW3OPU_4 0 AND WHEN YOU'RE IN THIS MODE THE CAMERA WILL AUTOMATICALLY HELP TO COMPENSATE WITH APERTURE
GpMoGDW3OPU_5 0 IT WILL TRY TO GIVE YOU THE LARGEST APERTURE SETTING IN ORDER TO MAKE THE BACKGROUND BLUR OUT A LOT AND IT WILL HELP TO MAKE YOUR SUBJECT OR YOUR PORTRAIT INDIVIDUAL STAND OUT FROM THE BACKGROUND
GpMoGDW3OPU_6 0 WHEN YOU'RE TAKING PORTRAITS IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA TO MAKE THE BACKGROUND AS FAR AWAY FROM THE SUBJECT AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM STICK OUT FROM THE BACKGROUND
GpMoGDW3OPU_7 0 BUT THIS MODE WILL HELP TO SOFTEN THE SKIN TONES ON YOUR SUBJECT
GpMoGDW3OPU_8 0 AND IF YOU HAVE A TELEPHOTO LENS THAT WILL ALSO HELP TO BLUR THE BACKGROUND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

hGOhN59c5HU_5 0 HOWEVER I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT YOU HAVE NOT BOUGHT THESE AND TEACH YOU HOW TO DO THIS WITH THE MOST BASIC EQUIPMENT
hGOhN59c5HU_6 0 THE SIMPLEST WAY TO START A SIPHON IS TO FILL A RACKING CANE AND HOSE FILLED WITH WATER PINCH OFF THE END THEN DIP THE END OF THE RACKING CANE INTO YOUR BEER AND THEN OPEN UP THE OTHER END INTO THE VESSEL IN WHICH YOU WANT TO SIPHON YOUR BEER INTO
hGOhN59c5HU_7 0 TO DO THIS WE ARE GOING TO BE FILLING THE RACKING CANE OUT OF THE SINK WITH WATER AND THEN USING THIS TO START OUR SIPHON
hGOhN59c5HU_8 0 YOU WANT TO KEEP THE BOTTOM OF THE HOSE UNDERNEATH THE LEVEL OF THE BEER OR WATER THAT IS FLOWING IN
hGOhN59c5HU_9 0 AS YOU ARE RACKING FROM THE TOP YOU WANT TO KEEP THE END OF THE RACKING CANE UNDERNEATH THE TOP LEVEL BUT NOT DOWN IN ANY MUCK THAT MAY BE FORMING AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR FERMENTER
hGOhN59c5HU_10 0 YOU WILL KEEP THIS WORKING ITS WAY DOWN AS YOUR LEVELS OF WATER DROP
hGOhN59c5HU_11 0 AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH RACKING WE RECOMMEND PRACTICING WITH WATER AS I'M DOING NOW
hGOhN59c5HU_12 0 AFTER YOU ARE DONE RACKING PUT YOUR SANITIZED AIRLOCK AND STOPPER BACK ONTO YOUR CARBOY
hGOhN59c5HU_13 0 WHILE IT MAY BE TEMPTING TO START SIPHONING WITH YOUR OWN MOUTH DO NOT DO THIS CAUSE YOUR MOUTH IS FULL PLENTY OF MICROS IN YOUR MOUTH
gOWTeucGAts_1 0 NOW YOU MIGHT BE SAYING GEEZ I ONLY KNOW SEVEN SCRATCHES AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO SOUND GOOD AT IT AT FIRST BUT THE WAY YOU GET GOOD AT IT IS BY WOODSHEDDING THE SCRATCHES
gOWTeucGAts_2 0 NOW WHAT WOODSHEDDING IS IS YOU JUST TAKE ONE SCRATCH OR ONE COMBINATION OF SCRATCHES AND PRACTICE JUST THAT SCRATCH FOR A NUMBER OF MINUTES OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
gOWTeucGAts_3 0 SO IF YOU SEE A DRUMMER LEARNING A RUDIMENT OR A DRUM ROLL THE DRUMMER MIGHT GO AND PRACTICE A DRUM ROLL FOR FIVE SOLID MINUTES JUST THAT DRUM ROLL
gOWTeucGAts_4 0 SO YOU HAVE TO DO THE SAME THING HERE
gOWTeucGAts_5 0 YOU HAVE TO TAKE ONE SCRATCH AND WE'LL TAKE THE CHIRP SCRATCH AGAIN
gOWTeucGAts_6 0 AND IF YOU DON'T SOUND VERY GOOD AT IT AT FIRST BUT ONCE IT CLICKS ONCE YOU GET IT OH MAN I DID ONE RIGHT THEN YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK AND DO IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN VERY VERY SLOWLY
gOWTeucGAts_7 0 JUST PRACTICE THAT ONE SCRATCH AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU MIGHT EVEN WANT TO PRACTICE ONE PARTICULAR SCRATCH FOR THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF YOUR BREAK RECORD
gOWTeucGAts_8 0 THEN YOU'LL KNOW YOU'RE GETTING GOOD AT IT VERY FAST
h9L80BtdN2A_1 0 HI I'M BILL WITH ZOAR OUTDOOR ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM WE ARE HERE TODAY AT A CHAPEL LEDGES AT ASHFIELD MASSACHUSETTS AND IN THIS SERIES I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE BASICS OF MOVING ON ROCK
h9L80BtdN2A_2 0 STEMMING IS A TECHNIQUE THAT USES THE OPPOSITION OF FORCES ACROSS THE CORNER TO MAKE USE OF HAND AND FOOT HOLD THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE NOT HELP YOU
h9L80BtdN2A_3 0 SO BY PLACING MY FEET ACROSS THE CORNER AND USING MY HANDS TO STABILIZE ME I CAN STAND COMFORTABLE AND THEN MOVE UP BY OPPOSING MY LEFT FOOT WITH MY RIGHT HAND
h9L80BtdN2A_4 0 SO I CAN RELEASE MY RIGHT FOOT OPPOSING MY RIGHT FOOT WITH MY LEFT HAND SO I CAN MOVE MY LEFT FOOT AND UP I GO
h9L80BtdN2A_5 0 AGAIN YOU WANT TO AVOID STANDING UP TO STRAIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR STEMMING BECAUSE YOU WON'T HAVE ANY OPPOSITION AND YOU WOULD SLIP
h9L80BtdN2A_6 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR KEEPING YOUR HANDS LOW ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN PUSH NOT REACHING TO HIGH BECAUSE THAT WOULD AGAIN ELIMINATE YOUR OPPOSITION FORCES AND CAUSE YOU TO SLIP
h9L80BtdN2A_7 0 ONCE YOU GOT IT RIGHT IT IS REALLY STABLE YOU MIGHT EVEN GET A NO HANDS REST FOR A WHILE
gSg8EX84TYU_1 0 SO HOW DO YOU STRENGTHEN TEA'S FLAVOR
gSg8EX84TYU_2 0 I'M GOING TO USE BLACK TEA BECAUSE SO MANY OF YOU OUT THERE DRINK BLACK TEA
gSg8EX84TYU_3 0 SO A SIMPLE THIS IS ABOUT TEN TWELVE OUNCES OF TEA AND LIKE MY TEA STRONG BUT I'VE NEVER HAD THIS CUP OF TEA FOR EXAMPLE
gSg8EX84TYU_4 0 SO I CAN USE A GOOD AMOUNT FOR MY EIGHT TO TEN OUNCES BUT I WANT TO TRY IT STRONGER
gSg8EX84TYU_5 0 WITH BLACK TEA YOU SHOULD NOT LET IT BREW FOR TOO LONG WE'RE SO USED TO TEABAGS BECAUSE WITH TEABAGS YOU CAN LET IT SIT FOR AN HOUR TWO HOURS FOR THE WHOLE DAY AND YOU'LL GET A STRONG CUP BUT IT BASICALLY WILL TASTE THE SAME
gSg8EX84TYU_6 0 WITH LOOSE LEAF TEA IS VERY DIFFERENT
gSg8EX84TYU_7 0 YOU'LL NOTICE RIGHT AWAY WHEN I PUT IN THE BOILING WATER THAT THE COLOR WILL CHANGE IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME
gSg8EX84TYU_8 0 YOU CAN NOTICE A COLOR DIFFERENCE RIGHT AWAY THIS IS A LIGHTER BROWN THIS IS A DARKER BROWN INSTANTLY
gSg8EX84TYU_9 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT THREE TO FIVE MINUTES TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE THAT THIS ONE'S A LOT STRONGER THAN THIS ONE
gSg8EX84TYU_10 0 AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME A QUICK BREW WITH A LOT OF TEA LEAVES IS THE WAY TO GO
gSg8EX84TYU_11 0 SO IN ORDER FOR YOU TO MAKE STRONG TEA I DON'T RECOMMEND LEAVING IT FOR TOO LONG
gSg8EX84TYU_12 0 I ALWAYS RECOMMEND ADDING MORE TEA LEAVES AND USING IT OVER AND OVER FOR MORE TEA
gSg8EX84TYU_13 0 TO MAKE STRONGER HERBAL TEA YOU'RE WELCOME TO LEAVE IT FOR A LONG TIME BUT FOR GREEN TEA AND OOLONG USING MORE TEA LEAVES IS THE BEST WAY TO GO AND INCREASING THE TEMPERATURE JUST A LITTLE BIT WOULD BE THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_1 0 HI THIS IS AARON HALE AT FITNESS FOR LIFE HERE IN WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA HERE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO GAIN UPPER BODY STRENGTH
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_2 0 FIRST AND FOREMOST IF WE ARE TRYING TO GAIN UPPER BODY STRENGTH THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO IS GET ON A WORKOUT SCHEDULE THAT WE KNOW WE CAN ADHERE TO AND MAINTAIN A CONSISTENT WORKOUT WITH
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_3 0 IF WE CAN MAINTAIN A CONSISTENT WORKOUT THEN MORE LIKELY THE CHANCES ARE THAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE THE CHANGE IN OUR STRENGTH AND IN OUR ENDURANCE INCREASE IN OUR BODIES
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_4 0 SECOND IF WE CAN FIND A WORKOUT SCHEDULE THAT WE CAN ADHERE TO AND WE CAN STAY CONSISTENT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE UP THE WORKOUT
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_5 0 IF YOU ARE DOING THE SAME THING TIME AND TIME AGAIN EVENTUALLY THE BODY IS GOING TO STOP RESPONDING TO THOSE WORKOUTS
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_6 0 IF YOU ARE DOING A BENCH PRESS AND YOU CONTINUE TO DO THE BENCH PRESS ALL THE TIME YOU NEED TO CHANGE TO A DUMBBELL PRESS
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_7 0 MAYBE YOU NEED TO CHANGE IT TO AN INCLINE DUMBBELL PRESS EVEN SET UP A FLAT BENCH MAYBE EVEN DO SOMETHING OFF A SMITH MACHINE
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_8 0 THERE IS ALWAYS DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN TARGET THE SAME MUSCLES AND EVEN THE SAME SPOTS IN THOSE MUSCLE FIBERS DIFFERENTLY THAT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO SHOCK THE BODY SO THE BODY IS GOING TO RESPOND
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_9 0 NUMBER THREE AND JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE OTHERS WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR FORM IS CORRECT
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_10 0 THIS IS WHERE A PERSONAL TRAINER OR SOMEBODY WHO IS EDUCATED IN THE FIELD OF STRENGTH CONDITIONING REALLY IS GOING TO COME INTO PLAY BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR BIOMECHANICS AND YOUR FORM IS PROPER
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_11 0 IF YOUR FORM IS SLOPPY AND YOUR BIOMECHANICS ARE BAD YOUR BODY IS NOT GOING TO RESPOND THE WAY YOU WANT IT TO SO THOSE THREE THINGS AGAIN WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN AND ADHERE TO A SCHEDULE THAT IS GOING TO WORK FOR US AND WE CAN BENEFIT FROM SO CONSISTENCY BEING A BIG ONE
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_12 0 SECONDLY WE HAVE GOT TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE OUR WORKOUTS MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CHANGING THE WEIGHT WE ARE CHANGING THE WAY WE DO THOSE WORKOUTS AND LASTLY AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY MAKE SURE THAT OUR FORM IS PROPER
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_13 0 IF WE CAN MAINTAIN PROPER FORM AND WORK WITH SOMEBODY WHO IS A BIT EDUCATED IN THE FIELD CAN SHOW YOU HOW TO STAY FOCUSED YOU WILL SEE THE RESULTS THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_14 0 THAT'S BEEN AARON HALE HERE AT FITNESS FOR LIFE HERE IN WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA
HhgieT3w08k_1 0 PHIL COONROD HI
HhgieT3w08k_2 0 THIS IS PHIL COONROD ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
HhgieT3w08k_3 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO BEAT CALL OF DUTY FOUR MODERN WARFARE
HhgieT3w08k_4 0 CALL OF DUTY FOUR MODERN WARFARE IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF ACTIVISION A COMPANY IN WHICH I HAVE NO AFFILIATION
HhgieT3w08k_5 0 BUT IT'S JUST A COOL LEVEL
HhgieT3w08k_6 0 IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT
HhgieT3w08k_7 0 THERE'S NOT A LOT GAMES THAT HAVE A TWO-MAN SNIPER TEAM
HhgieT3w08k_8 0 WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO A COUPLE OF A REALLY HAIRY SITUATIONS IN THIS LEVEL
HhgieT3w08k_9 0 BUT YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE SURE YOU GET A ONE SHOT ONE KILL ON THIS FIRST WE KINDA HAVE WAY POINTS OR WHATEVER WITH CAPTAIN MCMILLAN HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH A FEW FEW LITTLE THINGS WITH TAKING DOWN SOME GUARD SOME GUARD POST AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT YOU'VE GOT YOU HAVE TO GET THE ONE SHOT ONE KILL TO BEGIN WITH HERE
HhgieT3w08k_10 0 OTHERWISE YOU'LL GET FOUND OUT THEN YOU'LL DIE
HhgieT3w08k_11 0 I DON'T THINK THERE'S A WAY YOU FIGHT OUT OF OUT OF THOSE SITUATIONS IF THEY'RE ON TO YOU
HhgieT3w08k_12 0 HE GIVES YOU THE OPTION HERE TO SHOOT THIS GUY OR TO LET HIM GO AND I TEND TO JUST LIKE TO LET THIS ONE GO
HhgieT3w08k_13 0 THE OTHER ONES I ALL KILL I USUALLY LET THIS ONE GO BECAUSE THIS HOUSE IS FULL OF GUYS AND IF THEY HIM GET SHOT OR YOU ANYTHING GOES WRONG THEY'RE ALL GOING TO COME OUT
HhgieT3w08k_14 0 SO I LIKE TO GO I LIKE TO JUST LET THIS ONE GO AND HE JUST WENT BACK INSIDE SO WE'RE GOING TO STAY ON CAPTAIN MCMILLAN'S [SOUNDS LIKE] SIX
HhgieT3w08k_15 0 YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT THROUGHOUT THIS LEVEL
HhgieT3w08k_16 0 JUST STAY WITH HIM WHEREVER HE GOES WHATEVER HE DOES
HhgieT3w08k_17 0 JUST DO WHATEVER HE DOES
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_1 0 HI I'M TIM GIPSON AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HANGING A PICTURE
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_2 0 NOW THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO LOOK AT WHEN YOU'RE HANGING YOUR PICTURE IS YOU WANT TO LOOK ON THE BACK SIDE AND SEE WHAT TYPE OF ATTACH POINT IT HAS
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_3 0 NOW THIS PARTICULAR PICTURE THAT I'M GOING TO HANG RIGHT NOW AS YOU CAN SEE HAS THIS CLASP AT THE TOP THAT'LL HANG ON A HOOK OR A NAIL OR A SCREW
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_4 0 AS YOU SEE ON THE BACK OF THIS PICTURE AND YOU'LL SEE THIS ON HEAVIER PICTURES OR HEAVIER MIRRORS YOU ACTUALLY SEE THIS WIRE THAT IS STRUNG FROM EACH SIDE
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_5 0 AND SO THIS IS DESIGNED TO HANG ON A ON A HOOK THAT GOES INTO THE WALL
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_6 0 NOW IF WE HAVE WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DETERMINE IS WE GOT TO DETERMINE OUR HANG POINT SO WE WANT TO DETERMINE HOW HIGH THAT WE WANT THIS ON THE WALL
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_7 0 SO WE'LL HOLD IT UP AND WE'LL SAY WELL WE WANT IT RIGHT THERE OKAY
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_8 0 NOW WE CAN HOLD THIS WITH ONE POINT
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_9 0 SOMETIMES WE GOTTA GET OUR SHOULDERS AND HANDS INVOLVED
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_10 0 AND THEN WE WANT TO TAKE OUR PENCIL AND WE CAN MARK THE TOP OF THE PICTURE
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_11 0 NOW WE DID MARK THE TOP OF THE PICTURE BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHERE WE WANT TO PUT THE HANGER
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_12 0 AND THERE ARE SEVERAL HANGERS THAT WE CAN USE THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT AT THIS POINT
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_13 0 SO WHERE WE HAVE THIS CLIP NOW IN THE WALL RIGHT HERE WE'VE ALREADY GOT PRE-INSTALLED THERE JUST HAPPENED TO BE A STUD RIGHT HERE WHERE THIS PICTURE IS GOING
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_14 0 SO IN THAT CASE YOU CAN JUST NAIL IN A BROADHEAD NAIL OR JUST A STANDARD COMMON NAIL AND THAT'LL HOLD THAT
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_15 0 IF YOU HAVE THE WIRE THEN YOU'LL WANT TO USE A HOOK LIKE THIS THAT JUST GOES INTO THE NAIL
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_16 0 IF YOU HAVE HEAVIER DEVICES YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A SCREW IN ANCHOR SUCH AS THIS OR JUST A STANDARD ANCHOR WHERE YOU WOULD DRAW A HOLE AND THEN YOU WOULD USE A SCREW AS YOUR ATTACH POINT
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_17 0 SO IT REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW HEAVY YOUR ITEM IS
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_18 0 SO WHEN WE'RE HANGIN THIS WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO MEASURE DOWN FROM THE TOP
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_19 0 IN THIS CASE IT'S THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH SO IT WOULD COME UP FROM THE LINE AT WHERE WE WANT IT WE WOULD MEASURE THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH DOWN AND THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD DRIVE OUR NAIL
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_20 0 SO ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE NAIL IN THERE IT'S JUST SIMPLY LOCATING IT AND MAKING SURE IT HANGS LEVEL
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_21 0 NOW IT'S A GOOD IDEA WHEN YOU'RE DOIN THIS TO HAVE A TORPEDO LEVEL WHICH IS A SHORT LITTLE LEVEL THAT YOU CAN PUT ON TOP TO HELP YOU MAKE SURE YOU CAN HANG THIS LEVEL
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_22 0 AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_23 0 I'M TIM GIPSON AND THAT'S HOW TO HANG A PICTURE
gBgxA_jCk0A_1 0 HI THIS IS JOSIAH OWEN WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE TALK ABOUT MAKING A COOKIE TREE
gBgxA_jCk0A_2 0 ALRIGHT NOW THIS IS MELTED COMPLETELY AND I WE HAVE OUR WAX PAPER READY
gBgxA_jCk0A_3 0 WE CAN GO AHEAD AND POUR THIS ON HERE AND SET THIS TO THE SIDE YOU WANT TO FLATTEN THIS OUT SO WHAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO IS TAKE THIS YOU CAN FOLD IT OVER THAT WAY YOU CAN MANIPULATE WHAT'S GOING ON AND PUSH THIS TO THE SIDE NOW WATCH OUT IT'S A BIT WARM YOU WOULD NOTICE IT FROM LOOKING AT IT BUT IT IS
gBgxA_jCk0A_4 0 SO YOU WANT TO SPREAD THIS OUT
gBgxA_jCk0A_5 0 YOU WANT ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH TO A HALF AND INCH THICK RIGHT IN BETWEEN THERE
gBgxA_jCk0A_6 0 SO I'M GOING TO FLATTEN THIS OUT EVEN THEN WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS GO AHEAD AND THROW THIS IN THE OVEN EXCUSE ME NOT THE OVEN THE REFRIGERATOR
gBgxA_jCk0A_7 0 PULL IT OFF AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IT'S ONE PIECE SO GO AHEAD AND PUT THIS BACK OVER AND LET IT SET UNTIL IT'S COOL ABOUT FIVE TO TEN MINUTES
GiguArk30IQ_1 0 LINE HAS PROBABLY BEEN AROUND AS LONG AS WE HAVE PICKED UP SOMETHING AND SCRATCHED A MARK WITH IT
GiguArk30IQ_2 0 SO IT'S THE FIRST THING THAT WE DO WHEN WE START TO DRAW WE DRAW AN OUTLINE YOU DRAW THE MOM WITH THE ROUND LINE AND SO ON SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DRAWING WE ALMOST ALWAYS KIND OF THINK OF LINE
GiguArk30IQ_3 0 BUT THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT LINE IS USED
GiguArk30IQ_4 0 THIS IS A PICASSO PAINTING AND THIS IS USING THE LINE AS A CONTOUR TO SHOW YOU WHAT THE SHAPE OF THE BODY IS SO THIS IS A CONTOUR LINE
GiguArk30IQ_5 0 AND HE'S DEPENDING ON THAT BECAUSE REALLY WITHOUT THE LINE THIS WOULD JUST BE A LOVELY GROUP OF COLORS SORT OF SMUSHED TOGETHER
GiguArk30IQ_6 0 IT'S THE LINE THAT SORT OF HELPS GIVE THIS AN ACTUAL SUBJECT
GiguArk30IQ_7 0 COMPARED TO THAT WE'VE GOT THIS USE OF LINE WHERE HE'S ACTUALLY USING A WHITE LINE ON BLACK INSTEAD OF BLACK ON WHITE AND THIS IS A VERY SORT OF FREE WHAT WE WOULD CALL IT A SORT OF A CALLIGRAPHIC LINE VERY CURVY AND VERY FREE
GiguArk30IQ_8 0 IT'S A LOT ABOUT THE GESTURE OF THE FIGURE ALSO
GiguArk30IQ_9 0 IT'S VERY SIMPLE THIS DRAWING IS ABOUT LINE AND IT'S ABOUT BLACK AND WHITE THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT
GiguArk30IQ_10 0 YOU EVEN HAVE LINEAR ELEMENTS SOMETIMES
GiguArk30IQ_11 0 THIS IS A SERIES OF SCULPTURES AND IT'S PLAYING WITH THE IDEA OF LINE REACTING WITH THE SPACE SO IT'S NOT A DRAWING OF A LINE ON A PIECE OF PAPER BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A DRAWING REALLY WITH STEEL IN SPACE
GiguArk30IQ_12 0 SO LINE IS NOT JUST THE MARK YOU MAKE WITH A PENCIL
GiguArk30IQ_13 0 THEY MADE THIS PICTURE USING THE EDGE OF THE RIBBON AS A LINE AND THEN THEY REPEATED THE LINE TO CREATE THE SHAPE
GiguArk30IQ_14 0 SO THAT'S NOT REALLY AN OUTLINE BUT THIS IS BASICALLY A DESIGN BASED ON USING LINE
GiguArk30IQ_15 0 LINE ALSO AND I HOPE YOU CAN SEE THIS CAN BE USED TO CROSS HATCH AND CREATE MOVEMENT SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND FORM INSTEAD OF USING VALUE TO UNDERSTAND FORM
GiguArk30IQ_16 0 THE MOVEMENT OF THE LINE KIND OF CREATES THE FORM SO THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL THE PETALS UNFOLDING IN THIS RENDITION OF A ROSE
gVKwgUxyCIo_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS BARRY PAYNE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gVKwgUxyCIo_2 0 YOU CAN USE TESTING UNDERSTANDING AS A MIRROR TO REFLECT BACK THE OTHER PARTY'S WORDS IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT
gVKwgUxyCIo_3 0 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
gVKwgUxyCIo_4 0 YOU CAN SAY LET ME ASK YOU ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU SEE NO MERIT WHATSOEVER IN WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING
gVKwgUxyCIo_5 0 THAT'S DIFFICULT TO ANSWER
gVKwgUxyCIo_6 0 IF THEY SAY OH YES I SEE ITS VALUE THEN YOU CAN SAY OH FINE I'M GLAD THAT IT'S VALUABLE TO YOU
gVKwgUxyCIo_7 0 IF YOU SAY NO IT'S A BIT BLUNT AND IT RISKS THEM CAUSING MORE CONFLICT THEN THEY MAY BE READY TO HAVE
gVKwgUxyCIo_8 0 SO TESTING UNDERSTANDING CAN BE QUITE SUCCESSFUL PARTICULARLY IN LOOKING AT THE WEAK PARTS OF THEIR POSITION
gVKwgUxyCIo_9 0 SO WHEN YOU SAY THIS YOU'RE SURE YOU MEAN THIS AS WELL
gVKwgUxyCIo_10 0 SUMMARIZING YOU CAN SUMMARIZE THE CONCESSIONS YOU'VE MADE
gVKwgUxyCIo_11 0 YOU CAN SUMMARIZE THE OPTIONS YOU'VE PUT FORWARD THAT THEY'VE REFUSED
gVKwgUxyCIo_12 0 YOU CAN SUMMARIZE THE ILLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT THEY'VE PUT FORWARD SO SUMMARIZING CAN BE QUITE USEFUL
gVKwgUxyCIo_13 0 THERE'S ONE REASON ABOVE EVERY OTHER THAT TESTING UNDERSTANDING IS USEFUL THE NEGOTIATION WAS BETWEEN PHILLIPS OF HOLLAND AND IBM
gVKwgUxyCIo_14 0 WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS THAT PHILLIPS HAD SAID TO ALL OF THEIR ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE WORLD STOP YOU'RE NOT BUYING ANY MORE IT EQUIPMENT OR OFFICE EQUIPMENT WE'RE GOING TO BUY IT CENTRALLY
gVKwgUxyCIo_15 0 SO OF COURSE IBM WASN'T VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT
gVKwgUxyCIo_16 0 THEY KNEW THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE A FEW PROBLEMS GETTING THE PRICE
gVKwgUxyCIo_17 0 THE MEETING WAS IN LONDON
gVKwgUxyCIo_18 0 WE'D PREVIOUSLY HAD A MEETING OVER IN HOLLAND
gVKwgUxyCIo_19 0 I THOUGHT WELL I THINK IT'S THERE I THINK EVERYTHING IS IN PLACE
gVKwgUxyCIo_20 0 THE GUY WHO WAS REPRESENTING IBM SAID JUST A MINUTE THERE'S ONE POINT I'M NOT CLEAR ABOUT
gVKwgUxyCIo_21 0 HE SAID ARE YOU SURE THAT YOUR OFFICE IN ROME WILL OPEN BY THE END OF DECEMBER
gVKwgUxyCIo_22 0 THEY SAID SURE IT'S OPENING IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS OR IT COULD BE FEBRUARY OR MARCH
gVKwgUxyCIo_23 0 HE SAID I NEED TO KNOW FOR SURE IS IT GOING TO BE OPENING BY THE END OF THIS YEAR OR NOT
gVKwgUxyCIo_24 0 THEY SAID WE CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT
gVKwgUxyCIo_25 0 SO HE SAID GENTLEMEN I'M AFRAID THAT I'LL HAVE TO REMOVE THOSE NUMBERS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT
gVKwgUxyCIo_26 0 WELL I THOUGHT HE'D BLOWN IT
gVKwgUxyCIo_27 0 A MINOR POINT LIKE THAT ON A MAJOR NEGOTIATION
gVKwgUxyCIo_28 0 I SENT THE RESEARCH PAPERS BACK TO SHEFFIELD WHERE MY RESEARCHER WAS DOING THE ANALYSIS
gVKwgUxyCIo_29 0 I RANG HER UP AND I SAID LINDA THE ONE THAT I WAS OBSERVING WAS THAT ONE OF THE SUCCESSFUL GROUP OR ONE OF THE AVERAGE
gVKwgUxyCIo_30 0 BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW IN CASE IT BIASED OUR OBSERVATIONS
gVKwgUxyCIo_31 0 SHE SAID YEAH SUCCESSFUL
gVKwgUxyCIo_32 0 I SAID WELL I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE DID
gVKwgUxyCIo_33 0 THEY'RE GOING TO COME BACK TOMORROW TO FINISH THIS NEGOTIATION
gVKwgUxyCIo_34 0 IT WASN'T UNTIL SOMETIME AFTERWARDS THAT I REALIZED MOST OF US WHEN WE NEGOTIATE WANT TO CLOSE THE DEAL
gVKwgUxyCIo_35 0 SKILLED NEGOTIATORS ARE MORE MOTIVATED ABOUT OPENING A RELATIONSHIP WHICH WILL ENDURE
gVKwgUxyCIo_36 0 HE SAW SOMETHING LOOSE IN THAT CONTRACT WHICH WOULD SERVE AS A HAZARD TO IMPLEMENTATION AND HE WASN'T PREPARED TO LEAVE IT THERE
gVKwgUxyCIo_37 0 THEY CAME BACK THE NEXT DAY AND WITHIN AN HOUR IT WAS ALL SOLVED
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_1 0 HI I'M FALLEN FROM WORKBLAST.COM AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO ANSWER SOME FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE A VIDEO RESUME
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_2 0 SO HOW SHOULD I DRESS FOR MY VIDEO RESUME
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_3 0 APPEARANCE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN A VIDEO RESUME
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_4 0 NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ONLY REALLY ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE CAN BENEFIT
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_5 0 IT DOES MEAN THAT A PROFESSIONAL PRESENCE IS REQUIRED
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_6 0 MAKE SURE YOU DRESS APPROPRIATE FOR THE JOB INDUSTRY THAT YOU'RE PURSUING
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_7 0 IF POSSIBLE DO SOME RESEARCH INTO THE INDUSTRY STANDARD PRACTICE IS IT A VERY PROFESSIONAL ATMOSPHERE IS A SUIT AND TIE REQUIRED
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_8 0 REMEMBER THE DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND EVEN DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATIONS HAVE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF PROFESSIONAL ATTIRE
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_9 0 ON THE EAST COAST FOR EXAMPLE SALES PROFESSIONALS ARE VERY FORMAL RARELY WILL YOU SEE ANYONE GO INTO A CALL WITHOUT A SUIT TIE AND JACKET EVEN IN THE DEAD OF SUMMER
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_10 0 ON THE CONTRARY ON THE WEST COAST MANY SALES PROFESSIONALS WEAR ATTIRE THAT MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLES A PROFESSIONAL GOLFER RATHER THAN A SALES REP KHAKI'S AND A POLO SHIRT ARE OFTEN CONSIDERED DRESSED UP
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_11 0 ALWAYS ERR ON THE SIDE OF TOO PROFESSIONAL IF YOU'RE UNCERTAIN
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_12 0 NO ONE WILL DISCOUNT YOU FOR LOOKING TOO NICE
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_13 0 IF YOU CREATE A VIDEO RESUME IN A JEANS AND T-SHIRT YOU'RE PROBABLY ONLY HURTING YOURSELF
gBEv-iksiNo_1 0 NOW LET'S INSERT THE MATCHES INTO THE PAPER TOWEL ROLLS
gBEv-iksiNo_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO INSERT THE MATCHES WITH THE WOODEN PART OF THE MATCH THE STICK PART INSIDE ALL THE WAY UNTIL THE TIP OF THE MATCH IS JUST STICKING OUT AND CAN'T GO IN ANYMORE
gBEv-iksiNo_3 0 YOU CAN SEE INSIDE THAT ONCE THE MATCH STICKS ARE THERE THEY'RE CREATING THAT TYPE OF OBSTACLE FOR WHEN THE RICE FLOWS DOWN IT'S GOING TO BE HITTING THOSE MATCH STICKS AND MAKE IT GO DOWN MUCH SLOWER AND THAT'S GOING TO CREATE THE SOUND OF THE RAIN
gBEv-iksiNo_4 0 SO THE REASON WHY WE'RE PUTTING THE STICKS IN WITH THE WOODEN SIDE IN FIRST IS ONE BECAUSE THE TIPS OF THE MATCHES GIVE A DECORATION TO THE STICK AND THE OTHER REASON IS BECAUSE THE TIP OF THE MATCH ALSO HELPS THE STICK FROM NOT GOING THROUGH ALL THE WAY TO THE END
gBEv-iksiNo_5 0 KIND OF GIVES IT A STOP WHERE IT'S ABLE TO JUST STICK UP FROM THE PAPER TOWEL ROLL AND NOT BE GET LOST INSIDE THE ROLL
gBEv-iksiNo_6 0 SO THOSE ARE THE REASONS WHY WE'RE PUTTING THE WOODEN PART IN FIRST
gBEv-iksiNo_7 0 NOW IF YOU WANTED TO YOU COULD USE COLORED MATCH STICKS MATCHES RATHER WHERE THE HEAD OF THE MATCH IS A DIFFERENT COLOR AND YOU CAN ALTERNATE THOSE COLORS
gBEv-iksiNo_8 0 WE'RE USING ONE COLOR WHICH IS RED WHICH IS USUALLY COMMONLY FOUND AMONG WOODEN MATCH STICKS BUT THEY DO HAVE DIFFERENT COLORS AND IF YOU CAN OBTAIN THEM YOU CAN REALLY MAKE A NICE DECORATION ON YOUR STICK USING THE ALTERNATING THE COLORS AND MAKING A DIFFERENT DESIGN WITH THEM
gBEv-iksiNo_9 0 BUT NOW WE CAN SEE SINCE WE MADE THE HOLES ALONG THE SEAM LINE WE CAN SEE NOW WHY IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MATCH UP THE ROLLS ALONG THE SEAM LINE BECAUSE WE WANTED TO HAVE A CONTINUATION OF THE MATCH STICKS GOING FORM THE TOP TO BOTTOM
gBEv-iksiNo_10 0 SO THAT'S WHY WE MATCHED IT UP SO IT LOOKS VERY SYMMETRICAL
gBEv-iksiNo_11 0 THE LONGER THE ROLL IS THE MORE MATCHES YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PUT IN AND THEN THEY'LL BE MORE OBSTACLES FOR THE RICE GOING DOWN
gBEv-iksiNo_12 0 AND AGAIN THOSE OBSTACLES THE RICE HITTING THE MATCH STICKS IS WHAT'S CREATING THE NOISE SO IT'LL GIVE IT MORE OF AN EFFECT WHEN YOU'RE USING THE LONGER ROLL AND YOU'RE ABLE TO INSERT MORE MATCH STICKS
gBEv-iksiNo_13 0 SO WE PUT THE MATCH STICKS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE END
gBEv-iksiNo_14 0 FOR THIS PROJECT WE'VE USED ABOUT A BOX AND A HALF OF MATCH STICKS
gBEv-iksiNo_15 0 AND IT'S GOOD TO HAVE AT LEAST TWO MATCH STICK MATCH BOXES ON HAND
gBEv-iksiNo_17 0 JUST IN CASE YOUR ROLLS ARE A LITTLE LONGER THAN THE ONE'S WE'VE USED
gBEv-iksiNo_18 0 AND WE SEE THIS IS HOW THE STICK LOOKS ONCE THE MATCH STICKS ARE PLACED INSIDE ALONG THE SEAM LINE AND WE SEE THAT THEY'RE SPACED EVENLY
gBEv-iksiNo_19 0 THEY GO ALONG THE SEEM FROM TOP TO BOTTOM SO IT HAS A NICE EVEN SYMMETRICAL LOOK TO IT
gBEv-iksiNo_20 0 AND NOW I'VE SHOWN YOU HOW TO PLACE THE MATCH STICKS INSIDE THE ROLLS
GSx_C8A3iWY_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS DR SUSAN JEWELL AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WAYS TO LIVE WITH MENOPAUSE
GSx_C8A3iWY_2 0 NOW IN THIS PARTICULAR CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANT HRT TREATMENT THERAPY THAT MOST WOMEN ARE PRESCRIBED BY THEIR PHYSICIANS WHEN THEY ENTER MENOPAUSAL STAGE IN THEIR LIVES
GSx_C8A3iWY_3 0 NOW WHAT'S HRT
GSx_C8A3iWY_4 0 LOOK AT THIS BOARD AND LET LET'S SEE WHAT THE DEFINITION OF HRT WELL HRT IS AN ACRONYM FOR HORMONAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY
GSx_C8A3iWY_5 0 NOW THIS IS A VERY POPULAR TREATMENT THAT DOCTORS PRESCRIBE
GSx_C8A3iWY_6 0 IT'S A PRESCRIBED PROGRAM TO TREAT HORMONAL IMBALANCE ASSOCIATED WITH MENOPAUSE
GSx_C8A3iWY_7 0 NOW THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT THINGS TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT HRT THERAPY
GSx_C8A3iWY_8 0 NOW YOU CAN GET HRT THERAPY TWO WAYS
GSx_C8A3iWY_9 0 YOU CAN GET WITH ONLY ESTROGEN IN THE THERAPY THAT'S ALL THAT MEANS THAT THEY'RE ONLY PRESCRIBE ESTROGEN FOR YOU FOR THE TREATMENT OR YOU CAN GET A COMBINATION OF HORMONES IN THE THERAPY WHICH IS ESTROGEN COMBINED WITH OTHER PARTICULAR HORMONES LIKE PROGESTERONE ESTREEN PROGESTIN AND TESTOSTERONE
GSx_C8A3iWY_10 0 THIS COMBINATION IS ACTUALLY MORE RECOMMENDED BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE GOING TO DECREASE YOUR LONG EXPOSURE OF ESTROGEN OR HIGHER EXPOSURE TO ESTROGEN IN THE BODY OR UNOPPOSED ESTROGEN BECAUSE UNOPPOSED ESTROGEN PUTS YOU AT HIGHER RISK TO DEVELOPING CERTAIN CANCERS LIKE ENDOMETRIAL CANCER
GSx_C8A3iWY_11 0 SO COMBINATION THERAPY IS USUALLY THE NUMBER ONE RECOMMENDATION FOR WOMEN ENTERING MENOPAUSE
GSx_C8A3iWY_12 0 NOW HRT IS GOOD BECAUSE IT HELPS THE WOMAN ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS OF MENOPAUSE AND THAT IS IT HELPS WITH MOOD SWINGS AND HOT FLASHES
GSx_C8A3iWY_13 0 IT ALSO HELPS WOMEN TO MAINTAIN SOME MEMORY BECAUSE MENOPAUSE WOMEN START TO LOSE MEMORY AND A THAT'S A ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS
GSx_C8A3iWY_14 0 SO HRT HELPS WITH THAT AND IT HELPS WITH ONE OF THE CONDITIONS THAT YOU ALSO FIND IS VAGINAL DRYNESS
GSx_C8A3iWY_15 0 THAT IS A VERY COMMON SYMPTOM THAT WOMEN EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY GO THROUGH MENOPAUSE
GSx_C8A3iWY_16 0 NOW WHAT IS THE HORMONAL REPLACEMENT SCHEDULE
GSx_C8A3iWY_17 0 WELL THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT SCHEDULES THAT THE DOCTOR CAN PUT YOU ON
GSx_C8A3iWY_18 0 AND THAT IS CALLED THE CYCLIC SCHEDULE OR THE CONTINUOUS SCHEDULE
GSx_C8A3iWY_19 0 NOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THAT IN ON A CYCLIC SCHEDULE YOU'LL BASICALLY TAKING ESTROGEN HORMONE TWENTY FIVE DAYS IN A MONTH AND THEN ON THE TWELFTH DAY THEY GOING TO ADD PROGESTERONE AND WITH THIS PARTICULAR TREATMENT SCHEDULE YOU'RE GOING TO THE WOMAN IS GOING TO EXPERIENCE A PERIOD OR BLEEDING LIKE A MONTHLY PERIOD A MENSTRUAL PERIOD
GSx_C8A3iWY_20 0 SO BUT THAT'S INDUCED YOU KNOW SYNTHETICALLY IT'S NOT NATURAL SO THE OTHER SCHEDULE IS THE CONTINUOUS SCHEDULE WHICH MEANS THAT YOU BASICALLY TAKING ESTROGEN EVERYDAY
GUQo3MA2MyE_1 0 NEXT WE'RE GOING TO START BASICALLY TO FLESH OUT OUR HERE
GUQo3MA2MyE_2 0 AND THAT'S WHEN WE'RE GOING TO START DRAWING SOMETHING LIKE THE SHOULDER REGION HERE
GUQo3MA2MyE_3 0 NOW BASICALLY PUTTING CLOTHES ON THE SKELETON WE'VE DRAWN IN HERE BECAUSE THAT'S YOU KNOW PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT IS
GUQo3MA2MyE_4 0 IT'S A LITTLE MORE THAN A SKELETON
GUQo3MA2MyE_5 0 THE NICE THING IS AND YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH FOLLOW ALONG HERE AND BE ABLE TO KIND OF SEE WHERE OUR MAIN DETAILS ARE GOING TO GO BECAUSE THESE ARE LIKE WONDERFUL GUIDES FOR US
GUQo3MA2MyE_6 0 I MEAN IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE EQUIDISTANT ON EACH SIDE OF THE LINES
GUQo3MA2MyE_7 0 THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG LESSONS YOU ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE AND LEARN
GUQo3MA2MyE_8 0 AND THEN YOU KNOW THIS IS A HERO
GUQo3MA2MyE_9 0 HEROES ARE ALL ABOUT COMMA SHAPES
GUQo3MA2MyE_10 0 WHAT DO I MEAN BY COMMA SHAPES
GUQo3MA2MyE_11 0 WHAT I MEAN IS THIS
GUQo3MA2MyE_12 0 SEE THIS RIGHT HERE
GUQo3MA2MyE_13 0 THIS IS A BULGING MUSCLE
GUQo3MA2MyE_14 0 IT'S A COMMA SHAPE
GUQo3MA2MyE_15 0 US NORMAL DUDES YEAH WE HAVE PRETTY MUCH A STRAIGHT LINE IF WE'RE LUCKY
GUQo3MA2MyE_16 0 OR YOU'RE BULGING OFF THE OTHER WAY ON A COMMA THAT'S NOT SO FLATTERING
GUQo3MA2MyE_17 0 SO IT'S ALL ABOUT LIKE DRAWING IN REALLY POWERFUL POSES
GUQo3MA2MyE_18 0 YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT SOMEBODY JUST HANGING AROUND SLACKING OFF
GUQo3MA2MyE_19 0 THESE ARE HEROES
GUQo3MA2MyE_20 0 THEY'RE OUT FIGHTING CRIME
GUQo3MA2MyE_22 0 SO WE CONTINUE TO BASICALLY COME IN HERE ON THE DETAILS AND WE'RE GOING TO FINISH BASICALLY OUTLINING OUR BODY
GUQo3MA2MyE_23 0 AND IT'S ACTUALLY AFTER THAT POINT WHERE WE'LL ADD IN THE DETAILS ADDITIONAL DETAILS LIKE ON THE COSTUME AND THE LIKE
GUQo3MA2MyE_24 0 NOW WE HAVE OUR BASIC DYNAMIC POSE
GUQo3MA2MyE_25 0 ALL THE FLESH AND BONES ARE ON THERE BUT YOU KNOW THIS GUY'S LOOKING A LITTLE BLANK
GUQo3MA2MyE_26 0 SO LET'S START DRAWING THE DETAILS NOW
GUQo3MA2MyE_27 0 AND THE IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IN THESE DETAILS ARE THEY SHOULD FOLLOW THE CONTOUR OF THE BODY
GUQo3MA2MyE_28 0 THAT'S ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO DO BECAUSE THIS IS NOT LIKE A FLAT OBJECT NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT LOOKS TO BE LINES HAVE TO EBB AND FLOW AND FOLLOW ALONG IN DIFFERENT AREAS
GUQo3MA2MyE_29 0 BECAUSE THIS IS YOU KNOW A LIVING BREATHING COMIC CREATION HERE
GUQo3MA2MyE_30 0 THIS IS NOT A STATIC INDIVIDUAL
GUQo3MA2MyE_31 0 THIS IS A REAL BREATHING PERSON
GUQo3MA2MyE_32 0 SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LINES ACCOUNT FOR THAT AS WE'RE DRAWING THINGS IN
GUQo3MA2MyE_33 0 ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS ON SPIDERMAN ONE OF THE MOST NERVE RACKING IS ALWAYS DRAWING IN THE EYES RIGHT
GUQo3MA2MyE_34 0 SPIDERMAN ALWAYS HAS THOSE CRAZY EYES AND IT'S SO EASY TO MESS UP ON
GUQo3MA2MyE_35 0 AND AS SOON AS YOU DO YOUR LIKE OH BOY YEAH THAT'S IT
GUQo3MA2MyE_36 0 SO I KIND OF LIKE TO DRAW THEM IN AS REALLY MUCH MORE STARK AT FIRST
GUQo3MA2MyE_37 0 THIS IS REALLY JUST KIND OF GIVING YOU AN IDEA OF HOW THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO GO
GUQo3MA2MyE_38 0 I RECOMMEND WITH YOUR PENCIL GO UP TRACING A VERY VERY LIGHT LINE OVER THINGS FOR THE TIME BEING
GUQo3MA2MyE_39 0 DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DARK YOU MIGHT BE COMING BACK IN HERE MAKING CORRECTIONS LATER ON
GUQo3MA2MyE_40 0 VERY FEW DRAWINGS ARE DRAWN IN PERFECTLY THE FIRST TIME
GUQo3MA2MyE_41 0 IF ANYBODY ELSE IS TELLING YOU DIFFERENT IS WELL THEY'RE JUST NOT BEING HONEST WITH YOU
GUQo3MA2MyE_42 0 LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT
GUQo3MA2MyE_43 0 SO IT'S BRINGING THESE LINES DOWN HERE BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO BE THE WEBBING PART OF SPIDERMAN'S COSTUME
GUQo3MA2MyE_44 0 SPIDERMAN HAS DIFFERENT PARTS OF HIS COSTUME
GUQo3MA2MyE_45 0 AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP THAT IN MIND
GUQo3MA2MyE_46 0 ACTUALLY IN SOME WAYS HE'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN SOME OTHER CHARACTERS YOU KNOW LIKE YOUR SUPERMANS AND YOUR BATMANS OF THE WORLD WELL RELATIVELY SIMPLE COLOR SCHEME WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR COSTUMES
GUQo3MA2MyE_47 0 SPIDERMAN SPIDERMAN'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED
GUQo3MA2MyE_48 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IN HERE IS MAKE SURE WE GET THE BASIC OUTLINES OF SPIDERMAN'S COSTUME LIKE HIS BOOT AREAS AND CENTRAL AREAS AND ONCE MORE HIS ARM
GUQo3MA2MyE_49 0 AND WE'RE THEN GOING TO BASICALLY ADD IN ALL THESE COBWEB LINES
GUQo3MA2MyE_50 0 NOW I'M DOING THIS QUITE FAST
GUQo3MA2MyE_51 0 BUT THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY TAKE A LOT OF TIME
GUQo3MA2MyE_52 0 BECAUSE TO DO THIS RIGHT TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND A LOT OF SLOW EFFORT
GUQo3MA2MyE_53 0 SO CONTINUE ON
GUQo3MA2MyE_54 0 ON THE DETAILS OF THE COSTUME AND YOU'LL BE READY FOR THE NEXT STEP
GrfKZGZZC0A_1 0 ARE YOU READY TO ADD SOME CENTRAL ARMS TO YOUR SHIMMY
GrfKZGZZC0A_2 0 MY NAME'S KAREN AND THIS IS JOHANNA
GrfKZGZZC0A_3 0 WE'RE WITH HIP EXPRESSIONS BELLY DANCE STUDIO IN SAINT PETERSBURG FLORIDA
GrfKZGZZC0A_4 0 LET'S ADD THE NICE ARM OUTLINE TO OUR SHIMMY
GrfKZGZZC0A_5 0 SO THE ARMS ARE GOING TO START UP ABOVE AND THEY'RE GOING TO KIND OF WAVE IN AND OUT SORT OF TO GET THE NICE OUTLINE OF YOUR FIGURE OKAY
GrfKZGZZC0A_6 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THEM NICE AND SOFT AND THEY'RE JUST GOING TO FLOAT DOWN AND WE'RE GOING TO USE SUNRISE ARMS TO COME UP SO WE CAN REPEAT IT AND DRILL IT GOOD
GrfKZGZZC0A_7 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OUR FEET SLIGHTLY APART AND LET'S GET OUR SHIMMY GOING
GrfKZGZZC0A_8 0 MAKE SURE YOU PRACTICE THE TWO MOVES SEPARATELY BEFORE YOU PUT EM TOGETHER SO THAT THEY'RE NICE AND CLEAN
GrfKZGZZC0A_9 0 ALL RIGHT SO SUNRISE ARMS UP AND LET THEM FLOAT DOWN AND OUTLINE YOUR BODY NICE AND SOFT AND UP KEEP THAT SHIMMY GOING NICE AND POWERFUL
GrfKZGZZC0A_10 0 THIS IS REALLY GOOD WHEN YOU HAVE DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS BLARING ON TOP OF EACH OTHER WHEN YOU HAVE A NICE DRUM BEAT AND MAYBE SOME FLUTES ON TOP OF THAT
GrfKZGZZC0A_11 0 MAKE SURE YOUR BELLY BUTTON STAYS PULLED IN KEEP THOSE HEELS DOWN ON THE FLOOR KEEP BREATHING AND KEEP THE ARMS NICE AND STEADY AND SOFT
GrfKZGZZC0A_12 0 PRACTICE THIS IN THE MIRROR AND YOU'LL HAVE SOME NICE SENSUAL ARMS ON TOP OF YOUR BELLY DANCE SHIMMY
GatF4XtkjXw_1 0 SO IF YOU ARE DOING HOME MECHANICING AND WORKING ON YOUR BIKE DEFINITELY A GOOD THING TO DO IS KEEP THE CHAIN CLEAN AND LUBED KEEP YOUR BIKE CLEAN AND CHECK ALL YOUR CRITICAL BOLTS AND BEYOND THAT IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE THAT BRING IT ON IN TO THE BIKE STORE AND GET A FULL TUNE UP ON IT
GatF4XtkjXw_2 0 THINGS LIKE TRUING THE WHEELS REDOING BAR TAPE AND REDOING CABLES ARE KIND OF SOMETHING THAT A BIKE STORE IS REALLY GOOD AT HAS THE NECESSARY TOOLS AND KNOW HOW TO DO THAT
GatF4XtkjXw_3 0 IF YOU ARE GETTING A TUNE UP FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR GETTING THE CABLES AND THE HOUSINGS REPLACED WILL GIVE YOU A LOT SMOOTHER OF A SHIFTING BIKE A LOT SMOOTHER OF A BRAKING BIKE AND IT WILL BE QUIET AND CORRECT IN EVERY REGARD SO IF IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME THIS HOUSING AND THIS CABLE IS PROBABLY TIME TO GET IT REPLACED AND IF YOU HAVEN'T REPLACED IT IN A WHILE ONCE YOU GET ON THE NEW CABLE AND HOUSING IT WILL LIKE A BRAND NEW BIKE AND YOU WILL BE READY FOR THE NEXT SEASON
GatF4XtkjXw_4 0 ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR BRAKE PADS AND PRETTY IMPORTANTLY TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR CHAIN THE BIKE SHOP MECHANICS WILL MEASURE YOUR CHAIN AND MAKE SURE THAT IT HASN'T STRETCHED ANY
GatF4XtkjXw_5 0 IF IT HAS STRETCHED REPLACE IT AND IF IT NEEDS ANYTHING ELSE REPLACE IT AND WE CAN DO THAT AT CONTENDER BICYCLES
gQzOnQTBV-I_1 0 THE T STEP IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE A T IF YOU DRAW A T IT'S GOING TO COME UP OUT BACK ON THE STEP AND DOWN
gQzOnQTBV-I_2 0 I'M GOING TO STEP UP WITH A BASIC ADD IN THAT STRADDLE DOWN STEP BACK UP WITH MY BASIC AND EXIT THE BENCH
gQzOnQTBV-I_3 0 UP STRADDLE DOWN AND UP AND EXIT THE BENCH
gQzOnQTBV-I_4 0 TO MAKE IT MORE INTENSE I CAN REALLY STEP TO THE FRONT
gQzOnQTBV-I_5 0 WE CALL IT LARGE T STRADDLE AND THEN WALK BACK
gQzOnQTBV-I_6 0 LEAD THAT WITH A LEFT FOOT
gQzOnQTBV-I_7 0 I WAS LEADING WITH THE RIGHT
gQzOnQTBV-I_8 0 A LITTLE T IS RIGHT HERE
gQzOnQTBV-I_9 0 GET COMFORTABLE WITH LITTLE T THEN YOU CAN EXPAND IT TO REALLY START TO MOVE
gQzOnQTBV-I_10 0 ANOTHER OPTION IS TO DO THAT LARGE T AND A COUPLE HOP BACKS TO THE END
gQzOnQTBV-I_11 0 ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT OR I CAN ADD A PROPULSION IN THAT STRADDLE
gQzOnQTBV-I_12 0 ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
gQzOnQTBV-I_13 0 NOTICE I'M DOING A JUMP PROPULSION WITH A SOFT LUNGE
gQzOnQTBV-I_14 0 ONE TWO THREE JUMP AND EXIT THE BENCH
gQzOnQTBV-I_15 0 IT IS OKAY TO JUMP UP ONTO THE BENCH BUT JUMPING DOWN ONTO THE FLOOR THAT'S A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH IMPACT ON THE KNEES AND ANKLES
gQzOnQTBV-I_16 0 SAVE THAT PROPULSION MOVE POWER MOVE FOR UP ON THE BENCH
gQzOnQTBV-I_17 0 THAT'S OUR T STEP FROM THE END OF OUR BENCH
h8egbBYDMHs_1 0 OUR NEXT LOW GLYCEMIC MEAL IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE RICE LENTILS AND GROUND TURKEY
h8egbBYDMHs_2 0 NOW RICE IS NOT LOW GLYCEMIC ON IT'S OWN IT'S ACTUALLY A HIGH GLYCEMIC ITEM BUT AS SOON AS YOU ADD IN SOME BEANS AND SOME PROTEIN THAT'S A GOOD CARB
h8egbBYDMHs_3 0 YOU CAN DO ANYTHING
h8egbBYDMHs_4 0 YOU CAN DO LENTILS
h8egbBYDMHs_5 0 YOU CAN DO BLACK BEANS
h8egbBYDMHs_6 0 YOU COULD DO LAGOONS KIDNEY BEANS YOU KNOW WHATEVER YOUR PREFERENCE IS REALLY
h8egbBYDMHs_7 0 THERE'S A LARGE VARIETY OF LOW GLYCEMIC FOODS
h8egbBYDMHs_8 0 NEXT WE'RE GOING TO DO THE GROUND TURKEY
h8egbBYDMHs_9 0 I ACTUALLY DO EXTRA LEAN GROUND TURKEY
h8egbBYDMHs_10 0 THERE'S 26 GRAMS OF PROTEIN AND IT'S ONLY FIVE GRAMS OF FAT SO IT'S REALLY GOOD
h8egbBYDMHs_11 0 YOU COULD DO A LOW FAT LOW GLYCEMIC MEAL
h8egbBYDMHs_12 0 THEN I ADD IN SOME KIND OF VEGETABLE
h8egbBYDMHs_13 0 TODAY WE ARE GOING TO DO CUCUMBER
h8egbBYDMHs_14 0 YOU CAN ADD IT ON THE SIDE
h8egbBYDMHs_15 0 I PREFER MY VEGETABLES RAW
h8egbBYDMHs_16 0 ANYTIME YOU COOK VEGETABLES OVER 110 DEGREES YOU ACTUALLY COOK OUT ALL THE NUTRIENTS
h8egbBYDMHs_17 0 SO ANYTIME YOU COOK IT PAST THAT YOUR VEGETABLES WOULD BE REALLY SOFT
h8egbBYDMHs_18 0 IF YOU DON'T COOK THEM ENOUGH THEN THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE HARD ANYWAY SO WHY NOT EAT THEM RAW
h8egbBYDMHs_19 0 WE HAVE SOME FRESH CUCUMBER THERE
h8egbBYDMHs_20 0 ALSO ANOTHER GOOD LITTLE TIP IF YOU WANT TO DO TACOS
h8egbBYDMHs_21 0 TACOS ARE GREAT WITH GROUND TURKEY
h8egbBYDMHs_22 0 GROUND TURKEY IS A GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO HAMBURGER MEAT
h8egbBYDMHs_23 0 HAMBURGER MEAT IS HIGH IN FAT
h8egbBYDMHs_24 0 GROUND TURKEY YOU CAN PUT IN SOME SAUCE THAT TASTES EXACTLY THE SAME NO DIFFERENCE
h8egbBYDMHs_25 0 THIS IS ALL JUST A REALLY GOOD MEAL REALLY HEALTHY AND LOW GLYCEMIC
H748Z8Xfhmc_1 0 WILDLIFE REHABILITATION IS JUST RECENTLY BECOMING A PROFESSION
H748Z8Xfhmc_2 0 I'M A THIRD GENERATION REHABILITATOR
H748Z8Xfhmc_3 0 MY GRANDMOTHER DID IT MY MOTHER DID IT
H748Z8Xfhmc_4 0 I GREW UP DOING IT
H748Z8Xfhmc_5 0 BUT FOR THOSE OF USE WHO WERE DOING IT ALL THESE YEARS IT WAS MORE LIKE A HOBBY
H748Z8Xfhmc_6 0 IT WAS JUST SOMETHING YOU DID YOU HAD A KNACK FOR AN AFFINITY FOR AND PEOPLE IN YOUR COUNTY KNEW IT AND BROUGHT YOU THE ANIMALS
H748Z8Xfhmc_7 0 BUT IT WASN'T ANYTHING THAT YOU EVER STUDIED OR ACTUALLY MADE A LIVING AT
H748Z8Xfhmc_8 0 BUT IT HAS PROGRESSED NOW THAT THERE IS RESEARCH BEHIND IT AND THERE IS SCIENCE BEHIND IT AND STUDIES BEHIND IT AND SO IT HAS GROWN TO NOW IT IS A PROFESSION
H748Z8Xfhmc_9 0 AND THERE ARE NOW NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE TRAINING AND CONTINUING EDUCATION FOR ALL OF US THAT ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING TO DO THIS AS A PROFESSION
H748Z8Xfhmc_10 0 THAT BEING SAID THERE STILL ARE NOT A LOT OF ACTUAL WILDLIFE REHABILITATION FACILITIES OUT THERE AT LEAST IN OUR AREA
H748Z8Xfhmc_11 0 WE'RE REALLY ABOUT THE ONLY ACTUAL FREE STANDING WILDLIFE REHABILITATION FACILITY IN OUR STATE
H748Z8Xfhmc_12 0 THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE CONNECTED WITH COLLEGES AND STATE PARKS AND THEY DO A LITTLE BIT OF WILDLIFE REHABILITATION BUT BY AND LARGE MOST OF THE WILDLIFE REHABILITATORS IN OUR STATE ARE ACTUALLY HOME-BASED REHABILITATORS
H748Z8Xfhmc_13 0 BECAUSE IN OUR STATE WE CANNOT CHARGE FOR ANYTHING WE DO
H748Z8Xfhmc_14 0 WE CAN'T EVEN CHARGE FOR OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT WE DO
H748Z8Xfhmc_15 0 AND THAT MAY VARY FROM STATE TO STATE
H748Z8Xfhmc_16 0 DIFFERENT STATES HAVE DIFFERENT GUIDELINES AND RULES AND REGULATIONS INVOLVING THEIR PERMITS FOR THEIR WILDLIFE REHABILITATION AND EDUCATION BUT IN OUR STATE WE CAN'T DO IT
H748Z8Xfhmc_17 0 SO WE SURVIVE STRICTLY ON DONATIONS
H748Z8Xfhmc_18 0 AND SO WE ARE THE LUCKY ONES BECAUSE WE'RE ACTUALLY AT A FACILITY SO EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T GET PAID MUCH WE DO GET PAID AND I WOULD SAY PROBABLY A FACILITY YOU'RE LOOKING AT PROBABLY AROUND TWENTY THOUSAND A YEAR
H748Z8Xfhmc_19 0 YOU KNOW IT MAY BE UP TO TWENTY-FIVE IF YOU'RE AT AN ACTUAL MANAGEMENT OF ANIMAL CARE
H748Z8Xfhmc_20 0 THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE A NONPROFIT GENERALLY AND YOU'RE JUST NOT THE MONEY'S JUST NOT GOING TO BE THERE
H748Z8Xfhmc_21 0 IT'S DEFINITELY A COMMITMENT
H748Z8Xfhmc_22 0 IT'S MORE OF A LIFESTYLE AND A PASSION THAN IT IS JUST A JOB
H748Z8Xfhmc_23 0 I MEAN NO ONE IS IN THIS FOR THE MONEY
H748Z8Xfhmc_25 0 AND THOSE THAT ARE DOING IT OUT OF THEIR HOMES BASICALLY ARE NOT GETTING PAID ANYTHING
H748Z8Xfhmc_26 0 THEY'RE DOING IT OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET A LOT OF THE TIMES
H6yWxGMshEo_1 0 HI MY NAME IS TIM COLE
H6yWxGMshEo_2 0 I'M WITH THE AUSTIN REPTILE SERVICE AND I'VE BEEN KEEPING REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS FOR OVER FORTY YEARS AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT TO FEED FROGS
H6yWxGMshEo_3 0 FROGS ARE CARNIVORES SO THEY'RE GOING TO PRETTY MUCH EAT ANY ANIMAL THAT'S SMALLER THAN THEY ARE
H6yWxGMshEo_4 0 SO SMALL FROGS OBVIOUSLY WOULD START OUT WITH SMALL INSECTS AND THEY WORK THEIR WAY UP
H6yWxGMshEo_5 0 A GOOD EXAMPLE IS THE AMERICAN BULLFROG
H6yWxGMshEo_6 0 BULLFROGS EVEN AS TADPOLES WILL EAT SIBLINGS AND AS THEY METAMORPHASIZE AND GET OUT ON LAND THEY PRETTY MUCH WILL EAT ANYTHING SMALL ENOUGH TO GET IN THEIR MOUTH
H6yWxGMshEo_7 0 IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR AN ADULT BULLFROG TO EAT SNAKES OR TURTLES OR BIRDS OR MICE
H6yWxGMshEo_8 0 MOST FROGS THAT WE KEEP IN CAPTIVITY FOR PETS ARE LIKE THE AFRICAN BULLFROGS THE HORNED FROGS WHITE'S TREE FROGS
H6yWxGMshEo_9 0 THEY ALL DO VERY WELL ON INSECTS AND SOME OF THEM ON SMALL RODENTS ESPECIALLY THE AFRICAN BULLFROG
HGJuM16kaK8_1 0 THE NEXT SILHOUETTE THAT YOU CAN USE TO BUILD UPON AND THIS ON IN DEFINITION A SHEATH
HGJuM16kaK8_2 0 THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE I MEAN YOU COULD DO A LOT OF VARIATIONS OF IT BUT A SHEATH IS LITERALLY SOMETHING THAT JUST LIGHTLY GOES OVER THE SHAPE
HGJuM16kaK8_3 0 IT SHEATHES THE BODY
HGJuM16kaK8_4 0 SO THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH VARIATION AS FAR AS IN MY MIND RIGHT NOW
HGJuM16kaK8_5 0 COME UP WITH SOMETHING WHO KNOWS
HGJuM16kaK8_6 0 BUT IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE A SHEATH DRESS IT NEEDS TO NOT BE TIGHT AND IT NEEDS TO JUST GRAZE LIKE IT GOES SOFTLY IN AT THE WAIST BUT IT DOES HAVE A WAIST
HGJuM16kaK8_7 0 IT'S NOT VOLUMINOUS BY ANY MEANS
HGJuM16kaK8_8 0 IT DOES HAVE A WAIST AND THEN IT GOES IT FALLS AND HITS SOFTLY AT THE HIPS AND THEN IT JUST ANGLES SLIGHTLY DOWN BUT IT'S NOT TIGHT
HGJuM16kaK8_9 0 IT'S DEFINITELY NOT ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE OUT OF SPANDEX
HGJuM16kaK8_10 0 THIS STYLE AS A SHEATH DRESS CAN BE BUILT UP TO BE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS EVEN THOUGH TO BE A SHEATH IT HAS TO RETAIN THIS BASIC SHAPE
HGJuM16kaK8_11 0 PUTS PRINTS IN SEASON AND DO DIFFERENT KINDS OF DARTS LIKE I SHOWED YOU
HGJuM16kaK8_12 0 DO WEIRDO SLEEVES WHO KNOWS
HGJuM16kaK8_13 0 MAKE IT WHATEVER LENGTH
HGJuM16kaK8_14 0 JUST BE CREATIVE
GHloD6zECsM_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS TOM BRINTZENHOFE
GHloD6zECsM_2 0 I'M A CERTIFIED MASTER MECHANIC FROM READING PENNSYLVANIA
GHloD6zECsM_3 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO DIAGNOSE A COOLING SYSTEM PROBLEM
GHloD6zECsM_4 0 MOST VEHICLES HAVE ONE PROBLEM OR ANOTHER WHEN IT COMES TO COOLING SYSTEM EITHER GENERATING TOO MUCH HEAT OVERHEATING NOT GENERATING ENOUGH HEAT AND RUNNIN COLD ALL THE TIME
GHloD6zECsM_5 0 MOST PROBLEMS YOU'LL FIND WHEN IT COMES TO THE COOLING SYSTEM IS EITHER DEAD SUMMER WHEN IT'S REAL HOT OUTSIDE THEY TEND TO OVERHEAT PROBLEMS IN THE WINTER OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE NO HEAT
GHloD6zECsM_6 0 THE FIRST THING I'LL TALK ABOUT REAL QUICK IS THE THERMOSTAT
GHloD6zECsM_7 0 A LOT OF MAJORITY OF THE HEATING AND COOLING PROBLEMS COME FROM THIS THERMOSTAT
GHloD6zECsM_8 0 IF IT EVER STICKS CLOSED THE VEHICLE WILL OVERHEAT
GHloD6zECsM_9 0 IF IT STICKS OPEN A LOT OF TIMES IT WON'T GENERATE ANY HEAT
GHloD6zECsM_10 0 AND THE THERMOSTAT SITS RIGHT BACK HERE UP BESIDE THIS HOUSING
GHloD6zECsM_11 0 THE OTHER PROBLEM YOU MIGHT MIGHT FIND IS A RADIATOR
GHloD6zECsM_12 0 IF A RADIATOR GETS SOMEWHAT BLOCKED FROM CORROSION PIECES OF RUST AND STUFF FROM INSIDE THE ENGINE GETS BLOCKED UP INSIDE HERE AGAIN IT WILL OVERHEAT
GHloD6zECsM_13 0 ANOTHER PROBLEM YOU MIGHT HAVE IS YOU WON'T HAVE ANY HEAT ON THE INSIDE
GHloD6zECsM_14 0 ENGINE'S RUNNIN A GOOD TEMPERATURE IT'S NOT OVERHEATING NOT RUNNING COLD AND AGAIN YOU HAVE NO HEAT ON THE INSIDE
GHloD6zECsM_15 0 THE FIRST THING TO DO IS AFTER IT'S BEEN STARTED AND WARMED UP TO A GOOD TEMPERATURE CHECK THESE TWO HOSES
GHloD6zECsM_16 0 YOU HAVE AN IN IN HOSE AND AN OUT HOSE TO YOUR HEATER CORE
GHloD6zECsM_17 0 ON THIS JEEP IT'S REAL SIMPLE THE NEXT ONE HERE ON THE TOP
GHloD6zECsM_18 0 PUT YOUR HANDS ON EM AS YOU'RE RUNNING
GHloD6zECsM_19 0 PLEASE KEEP YOUR HANDS AWAY FROM THE FRONT OF THE ENGINE
GHloD6zECsM_20 0 THAT TENDS TO HURT IF YOU GET YOUR HANDS CAUGHT IN THERE
GHloD6zECsM_21 0 BUT THESE TWO HOSES RIGHT HERE SHOULD BE RELATIVELY THE SAME TEMPERATURE GOIN IN GOIN OUT
GHloD6zECsM_22 0 ONE'S GOING TO BE EXTREMELY HOT SO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU TOUCH IT
GHloD6zECsM_23 0 THE OTHER ONE SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY WARMER NOT NOT TOO MUCH BUT SLIGHTLY WARMER
GHloD6zECsM_24 0 IF THEY'RE NOT CHANCES ARE YOU GOT A BLOCKED HEATER CORE
GHloD6zECsM_25 0 IF YOU GOT ONE HOT GOIN IN AND THE OTHER ONE COMIN OUT STILL COLD IT'S A BLOCKED HEATER CORE
GHloD6zECsM_26 0 A LOT OF TIMES YOU CAN FLUSH EM OUT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THE WHOLE DASH APART TO CHANGE IT
GHloD6zECsM_27 0 OTHER ISSUE YOU MIGHT HAVE IS IT'S OVERHEATING TOO MUCH
GHloD6zECsM_28 0 SOMETIMES YOU'LL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE WATER PUMP
GHloD6zECsM_29 0 THE FINS BREAK OFF INSIDE IT
GHloD6zECsM_30 0 UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE ONE TO SHOW YA'
GHloD6zECsM_31 0 AND FINS BREAK OFF THEY DON'T MOVE ENOUGH ANTIFREEZE INSIDE THE MOTOR TO COOL IT OFF SO AGAIN YOU HAVE AN OVERHEATING PROBLEM
GHloD6zECsM_32 0 THE COOLING PROBLEMS ON A ON A VEHICLE ARE RELATIVELY PRETTY EASY TO DIAGNOSE
GHloD6zECsM_33 0 YOU EITHER HAVE LIKE I SAID BEFORE EITHER IT OVERHEATS OR IT DOESN'T GENERATE ENOUGH HEAT
GHloD6zECsM_34 0 AND WHAT I'VE EXPLAINED TO YOU IN IN THIS SHORT CLIP IS IT'S REAL EASY TO DIAGNOSE
GHloD6zECsM_35 0 YOU JUST FOLLOW THEM FEW FEW SMALL STEPS AND IT'LL BE A WALK IN THE PARK FOR YA'
HAagj_I2R_0_1 0 HERE WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT A TRICK CALLED ONE UP TWO UP
HAagj_I2R_0_2 0 NOW THERE ARE ACTUALLY A LOT OF VARIATIONS ON ONE UP TWO UP I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE RIGHT HERE
HAagj_I2R_0_3 0 THIS IS OUR NORMAL THREE BALL PATTERN AND WE THROW ONE STRAIGHT UP THEN WE THROW THE OTHER TWO STRAIGHT UP
HAagj_I2R_0_4 0 THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED ONE UP TWO UP
HAagj_I2R_0_5 0 SEE IF WE CAN DO IT
HAagj_I2R_0_6 0 ONE UP TWO UP THEN WE GO BACK
HAagj_I2R_0_7 0 NOW WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING HERE IS WE'RE THROWING ONE OF THE BALLS UP WITH OUR ONE HAND AND WE'RE JUGGLING TWO IN ONE OF OUR HANDS LIKE THIS AND OUR OTHER HAND IS THROWING IN UNISON WITH EVERY OTHER THROW FROM THIS HAND
HAagj_I2R_0_8 0 SO MY LEFT HAND IS GOING TO THROW HALF AS OFTEN AS MY RIGHT HAND IN UNISON
HAagj_I2R_0_9 0 SO WE HAVE ONE BALL TWO ONE UP TWO UP
HAagj_I2R_0_10 0 JUST LIKE THAT
HAagj_I2R_0_11 0 THIS TRICK TAKES QUITE A BIT OF PRACTICE
HAagj_I2R_0_12 0 THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS TO CLEAN UP
HAagj_I2R_0_13 0 YOU NEED TO HAVE A VARY SOLID TWO IN ONE HAND TO BE ABLE TO DO MOST OF THESE
HAagj_I2R_0_14 0 NOW A FEW OF MY FAVORITE VARIATIONS ON THIS YOU CAN DO IT IN COLUMNS SO THAT THERE'S ONE UP TWO UP
HAagj_I2R_0_15 0 LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN
HAagj_I2R_0_16 0 YOU CAN THROW IT IN COLUMNS SO ONE UP TWO UP LIKE THIS
HAagj_I2R_0_17 0 YOU WANT TO PRACTICE WITH BOTH HANDS DOING THE TWO SO THAT YOU CAN BE PROFICIENT WITH BOTH YOUR LEFT HAND AND YOUR RIGHT
HAagj_I2R_0_18 0 YOU CAN ALSO JUST VARY IT
HAagj_I2R_0_19 0 SO IT WILL BE LIKE THIS WITH THE ONE UP CROSSING HANDS IN BETWEEN
HAagj_I2R_0_20 0 ONE OF MY FAVORITE TRICKS I CALL IT THE M BECAUSE THE ONE UP MAKE UP AN M OVER THE TWO UPS
HAagj_I2R_0_21 0 NOW THERE ARE A MILLION VARIATIONS WITH THIS TRICK
HAagj_I2R_0_22 0 AS MANY THINGS AS YOU CAN THINK OF YOU CAN PROBABLY DO IT
HAagj_I2R_0_23 0 SO JUST GO AND TRY IT AND MESS AROUND AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AND YOU WILL PROBABLY COME UP WITH SOMETHING COOL OF YOUR OWN
h-7UBQQ0_wo_1 0 FOR WHITEWATER KAYAKING THERE ARE FIVE ESSENTIAL PIECES OF EQUIPMENT YOU DON'T WANT TO GO WITHOUT THEM
h-7UBQQ0_wo_2 0 FIRST OF ALL YOU GOT YOUR PADDLE THEY IS THE PROPER SIZE AND FIT FOR YOU AND WHAT YOU ARE USING
h-7UBQQ0_wo_3 0 THAT IS WHAT I HAVE HERE
h-7UBQQ0_wo_4 0 NEXT IS YOUR BOAT OF COURSE THE KAYAK THAT FITS YOU AND THE TYPE OF RIVER THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE ON
h-7UBQQ0_wo_5 0 YOU ALSO NEED YOUR PFD WHICH IS YOUR PERSONAL FLOTATION DEVICE I HAVE ON HERE THAT FITS SNUGGLY AND IT IS COMFORTABLE
h-7UBQQ0_wo_6 0 THE YOUR SPRAY SKIRT WHICH YOU PUT ON THE COCKPIT RIM TO KEEP THE WATER OUT OF THE BOAT AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST OF COURSE YOUR HELMET
h-7UBQQ0_wo_7 0 YOUR HELMET IS VERY IMPORTANT IT PROTECTS YOUR HEAD FROM ANYTHING THAT MAY GET IN THE WAY IT COULD BE YOUR OWN PADDLE AND IT HAS TO FIT PROPERLY SO RIGHT UNDER THE CHIN
h-7UBQQ0_wo_8 0 YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT COVERS THE FRONT PART OF YOUR HEAD
h-7UBQQ0_wo_9 0 SO FIVE ESSENTIAL PIECES IS WHAT YOU NEED WHEN YOU GO KAYAKING WHEN YOU HAVE THESE FIVE PIECES YOU THEN FULL OUTFITTED
h-7UBQQ0_wo_10 0 THE OTHER THINGS YOU MAY THINK ABOUT IS PROPER CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR SO WE WOULD DISCUSS THOSE LATER
gODs-0lceYM_1 0 THIS IS A RUM PUNCH IT'S CALLED CANADIAN RUM PUNCH
gODs-0lceYM_2 0 I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND GIVE YOU THE BIG INGREDIENTS TO MAKE THE BIG PUNCH THAT I'LL MAKE IN A COCKTAIL GLASS SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
gODs-0lceYM_3 0 NORMALLY WE WOULD BRING WATER TO A BOIL THEN YOU WOULD LIKE TWO PARTS SUGAR
gODs-0lceYM_4 0 AND THEN YOU WOULD STIR THE SUGAR UNTIL IT'S DISSOLVE

hABHfo_Olb4_1 0 HI I'M TAMAL BHATTACHARYA SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
hABHfo_Olb4_2 0 THE WORD MURAL IS DERIVED FROM THE LATIN WORD MURALIS THE FRENCH MURUS MEANING OF THE WALL
hABHfo_Olb4_3 0 A MURAL IS NOT JUST ANY PAINTING BUT IMPOSES A THREE DIMENSIONAL QUALITY TO A WALL
hABHfo_Olb4_4 0 HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF A TYPICAL MURAL USING THREE DIMENSIONAL OBJECTS
hABHfo_Olb4_5 0 I AM USING BOWLS LIDS EGG POTS TERRACOTTA TILES WITH DESIGNS AND METAL FACES
hABHfo_Olb4_6 0 I LAY THE OBJECTS OUT ON THE FLOOR IN THE PATTERN I WANT TO PUT ON THE WALL
hABHfo_Olb4_7 0 OBJECTS CAN BE REARRANGED INTO DIFFERENT DESIGNS UNTIL I FIND THE ONE YOU LIKE
hABHfo_Olb4_8 0 ALWAYS BE CREATIVE WHEN DESIGNING YOUR MURAL
hABHfo_Olb4_9 0 KEEP IN MIND THE ENVIRONMENT AND ARCHITECTURE OF THE SPACE IN RELATION TO YOUR MURAL
GHIuUE9ZYFk_1 0 IN A SINGLE LEG STRETCH WE ARE CONNECTING BACK MUSCLES TO OUR ABDOMINAL MUSCLES BY CONNECTING WITH LEGS AND SHOULDERS AS WELL
GHIuUE9ZYFk_2 0 YOU LAY DOWN ON A SOFT MAT OR A CARPET AND BRING THAT RIGHT KNEE IN TOWARDS YOU AND PUT YOUR LEFT HAND RIGHT AROUND THAT RIGHT FOOT AND THEN LOOK UP TOWARDS YOUR FOOT AND BRING THAT LEFT KNEE IN NOW TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN AND SWITCH WHERE BOTH LEGS ARE TUCKED RIGHT IN TOWARDS YOU WITH THE LEFT KNEE AND THEN YOU ARE GOING TO EXHALE SWITCH AND YOU ARE GOING TO INHALE AND EXHALE SWITCH AND INHALE LENGTHEN OUT SO THE TOES GO OUT LONG AND EXHALE
GHIuUE9ZYFk_3 0 NOW IT IS EASIER SOMETIMES TO START OFF DOING THIS BY LIFTING THAT LEG UP INHALE AND EXHALE IT IS MORE CHALLENGING AS YOU BRING IT DOWN TOWARDS THE FLOOR
GHIuUE9ZYFk_4 0 BUT THE BACK STAYS IN THE FLOOR AND CONTROL IT INHALING AND EXHALING INHALING AND EXHALING RELEASE JUST LAY RIGHT DOWN
gyj39v1OG1A_1 0 I'M JOANNA JOSEPH FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
gyj39v1OG1A_2 0 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CALLIGRAPHY AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT JUST PLAYING WITH THE PEN AND SEEING THE THINGS THAT IT CAN DO AND THE MARKS YOU CAN MAKE
gyj39v1OG1A_3 0 AND IT'S KIND OF A GOOD IDEA TO LET YOUR EYES GO SOFT FOCUS AND PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
gyj39v1OG1A_4 0 FEEL THE CONTACT OF THE PEN WITH THE PAPER
gyj39v1OG1A_5 0 AND START TO SEE START TO SEE THE WHITE AND BLACK PATTERNS
gyj39v1OG1A_6 0 MY LOGO AS A PROFESSIONAL CALLIGRAPHER IS A ZEBRA AND THE REASON I CHOSE A ZEBRA IS BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP OF BLACK AND WHITE AND THE NEGATIVE SPACE
gyj39v1OG1A_7 0 IT'S AS IMPORTANT TO SEE THAT WHITE SHAPE THAT'S CARVED OUT BY THE BLACK MARKS AS IT IS TO SEE THE BLACK MARKS
gyj39v1OG1A_8 0 THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED COUNTERS OR THE NEGATIVE SPACE INSIDE THE LETTERS
gyj39v1OG1A_9 0 IT'S IMPORTANT TO START SEEING THEM AND SENSING THEM AS A REAL WEIGHT
gyj39v1OG1A_10 0 YOU WANT TO WORK ON SPACING
gyj39v1OG1A_11 0 PRETEND YOU'RE POURING A LITTLE LIKE A SHOT GLASS OF KOOL AID OR SOMETHING BETWEEN EACH LETTER AND YOU WANT IT TO BE THE SAME AMOUNT
gyj39v1OG1A_12 0 AND THEN WHEN IT IS YOUR SPACING IS RIGHT
gyj39v1OG1A_13 0 THIS ISN'T PERFECTLY SPACED
gyj39v1OG1A_14 0 I WOULD BE IF I CHOSE THIS I WOULD WORK ON IT SOME MORE TIGHTEN UP THAT EASY
gyj39v1OG1A_15 0 SAME THING HERE THIS IS A CHALLENGE RIGHT HERE BETWEEN THESE TWO LETTERS THAT'S JUST NATURALLY A BIG SPACE SO SOMEHOW I'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TIGHTEN THAT UP AND I COULD
hGH3pC6m6Tc_1 0 HI I'M EVAN FROM GREGG'S CYCLES AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO CHANGE A FLAT TIRE
hGH3pC6m6Tc_2 0 THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS UNDO THE VALVE STEM TAKE YOUR VALVE CAP OFF AND THEN IF THERE IS ANY REMAINING AIR IN THE TIRE GO AHEAD AND LET MOST OF THAT AIR OUT
hGH3pC6m6Tc_3 0 THEN WITH YOUR TIRE LEVER GO AROUND THE EDGE OF YOUR TIRE PULL THAT GUY OFF OF THERE AND PULL YOUR TUBE OUT AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOT REMOVE YOUR TIRE BUT TAKE YOUR TUBE OUT AND PUT SOME AIR IN YOUR TUBE AND THAT WILL ENABLE YOU TO GO AROUND THE TUBE AND YOU CAN KIND OF FEEL WITH YOUR HAND OR LISTEN WITH YOUR EAR AND SEE IF YOU CAN FEEL A SMALL PUNCTURE OR HEAR SOME AIR COMING OUT OR A SPOT WHERE IT MAY BE BULGING WHERE THERE MAY BE SOMETHING STUCK IN THE TUBE OR SEE IF YOU CAN FEEL ANYTHING SHARP OR SEE MAYBE ANY GLASS THAT MAY HAVE GONE THROUGH THE TIRE INTO THE TUBE
hGH3pC6m6Tc_4 0 SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING SOMETIMES IT IS JUST A MYSTERY HOLE AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT GOT THERE BUT IF YOU ARE ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING WHAT YOU CAN THEN DO IS USE YOUR VALVE STEM AS A REFERENCE SO YOU WOULD FIND YOUR RIM WHERE THE VALVE PULL IS AND THEN BASED ON WHERE THE HOLE IS IN RELATION TO THE VALVE STEM FIND THAT SAME SPOT IN YOUR TIRE SO YOU CAN GO ALONG YOUR TIRE AND MAYBE IF YOU SEE A PIECE OF GLASS OR A THORN OR A LITTLE BARB FROM A BLACKBERRY BUSH YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND PICK IT OUT
hGH3pC6m6Tc_5 0 IF YOU HAVE A SMALL SHARP OBJECT KIND OF PICK SOME OF THOSE THINGS OUT AND THEN INFLATE YOUR NEW TUBE WITH A LITTLE AIR AND THEN REINSTALL YOUR VALVE STEM FIRST AND GO AROUND HERE WITH THE TIRE
hGH3pC6m6Tc_6 0 ONCE YOUR TUBE IS IN THERE ALL THE WAY GO AHEAD AND THEN REINSTALL YOUR TIRE THE REST OF THE WAY MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING ONLY YOUR HANDS BECAUSE IF YOU DO TRY TO USE A SCREWDRIVER OR EVEN A TIRE LEVER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU CAN END UP PINCHING YOUR TUBE BETWEEN THE TIRE AND THE RIM WHICH IS THEN CALLED A PINCH FLAT
hGH3pC6m6Tc_7 0 IT MAY NOT ACTUALLY GO FLAT UNTIL YOU GET OUT ON THE ROAD AND IT ACTUALLY HAS SOME SERIOUS PRESSURE UNDER IT AND THEN YOU'LL END UP FIXING ANOTHER FLAT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THAT'S NO GOOD
hGH3pC6m6Tc_8 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOUR VALVE STEM IS NICE AND STRAIGHT IN THERE PUMP IT UP REPLACE YOUR VALVE CAP AND REINSTALL YOUR WHEEL
hGH3pC6m6Tc_9 0 THAT IS HOW YOU FIX A FLAT
HDhM6e_3KWQ_1 0 CLIMBING ROPE IS YOUR BASIC ATTACHMENT TO THE ROCK
HDhM6e_3KWQ_2 0 YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO MAKE SURE TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT WHEN YOU GET ONE
HDhM6e_3KWQ_3 0 I RECOMMEND BUYING A SOMEWHERE AROUND A TEN AND A HALF MILLIMETER ROPE IT'S GONNA BE YOUR BASIC ROPE
HDhM6e_3KWQ_4 0 THIS IS A DYNAMIC ROPE SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IF YOU FALL ON IT IT'S GONNA STRETCH TO ABSORB THE SHOCK FROM FALLING
HDhM6e_3KWQ_5 0 IT'S GOOD CAUSE OTHERWISE YOU COULD REALLY INJURE YOURSELF WITH A SUDDEN STOP
HDhM6e_3KWQ_6 0 SO YOUR BASIC KNOT IS GONNA BE THE FIGURE EIGHT
HDhM6e_3KWQ_7 0 THE WAY YOU START THAT THAT WAY I START THAT IS I MAKE A LITTLE LOOP LIKE THIS TWIST IT AROUND ONE MORE TIME AND THEN TAKE THE END THROUGH THE TOP OF THAT LOOP
HDhM6e_3KWQ_8 0 AND YOU'LL SEE WHEN YOU PULL THAT OUT IT MAKES A FIGURE EIGHT THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT A FIGURE EIGHT
HDhM6e_3KWQ_9 0 SO THEN NOW THAT THE KNOT'S SET UP YOU TAKE YOUR LOOSE END AND YOU'RE GOING TO THREAD IT THROUGH YOUR HARNESS THROUGH BOTH THE LEG LOOPS IN THE TOP
HDhM6e_3KWQ_10 0 SOME HARNESSES HAVE ONLY A TOP SO THAT'S FINE TOO
HDhM6e_3KWQ_11 0 IF YOU HAVE BOTH LEG LOOPS AND THIS YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GO THROUGH BOTH
HDhM6e_3KWQ_12 0 AND THEN WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO IS YOU'RE GONNA FOLLOW THE KNOT AROUND
HDhM6e_3KWQ_13 0 SO THAT MEANS YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THIS FOLLOWING THE ROPE IT GOES IN COMES BACK OUT OK CONTINUES TO FOLLOW IT
HDhM6e_3KWQ_14 0 YOU SEE HOW THAT S MATCHING UP THE WHOLE WAY AROUND
HDhM6e_3KWQ_15 0 COME BEHIND AGAIN AND THEN ONE MORE TIME THROUGH
HDhM6e_3KWQ_16 0 WITH THIS TIED THIS WAY THERE'S NO WAY THAT KNOT'S GONNA COME OUT
HDhM6e_3KWQ_17 0 WHAT YOU CAN DO IS WHAT'S CALLED DRESSING A KNOT TO MAKE IT LOOK PRETTY SO IT ALL FITS TOGETHER NICELY
HDhM6e_3KWQ_18 0 YOU'VE GOT TWO COMING IN TWO COMING OUT STILL LOOKS LIKE A FIGURE EIGHT EVERY WHERE
HDhM6e_3KWQ_19 0 THAT S WHAT YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR
HDhM6e_3KWQ_20 0 THERE'S ONE MORE WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR END YOU WANT ABOUT FIVE TO SEVEN INCHES HERE LEFT OVER
HDhM6e_3KWQ_21 0 WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS CALLED A SPORT BACK
HDhM6e_3KWQ_22 0 YOU'RE GOING TO SEE WHERE THESE TWO COME OVER THESE TWO LINES AND JUST TUCK IT BACK IN THERE
HDhM6e_3KWQ_23 0 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TIGHT IT JUST KEEPS IT OUT OF YOUR WAY AND MAKES IT EASIER TO UNTIE LATER
HDhM6e_3KWQ_24 0 YOU JUST PULL THIS OUT LATER
H_fDFWaPmZ8_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM MY NAME IS MICHAEL SOHASKI AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT BLUFFS
H_fDFWaPmZ8_2 0 WHAT IS A BLUFF
H_fDFWaPmZ8_3 0 A BLUFF IS A SIMPLE MISREPRESENTATION OF A HAND THAT YOU DO NOT POSSESS
H_fDFWaPmZ8_4 0 FOR INSTANCE YOU MAY REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE ACES WHEN INDEED YOU MAY ONLY HAVE A SEVEN-TWO OFF SUIT
H_fDFWaPmZ8_5 0 WITH A SEVEN-TWO OFF SUIT YOU HOPE TO TAKE DOWN THE POT OR WIN THE POT WITHOUT THE CARDS
H_fDFWaPmZ8_6 0 PERHAPS ONE OF THE BEST BLUFFERS OF THE CURRENT ERA IS GUS HANSEN
H_fDFWaPmZ8_7 0 HE LITERALLY WILL PLAY ANY TWO CARDS AND YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT CARDS HE HAS
H_fDFWaPmZ8_8 0 HE COULD HAVE EXCELLENT CARDS OR HE COULD BE PLAYING WITH THE TWO-SEVEN AND WILLING TO BET UNTIL YOU GIVE UP YOUR HAND
H_fDFWaPmZ8_9 0 THAT IS A BLUFF
H_fDFWaPmZ8_10 0 GETTING CAUGHT IN THE BLUFF IS THE DOWNSIDE OF BLUFFING
H_fDFWaPmZ8_11 0 FOR INSTANCE IN A BLUFF YOU COULD END UP COMMITTING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF YOUR CHIPS
H_fDFWaPmZ8_12 0 THE PERSON AGAINST WHOM YOU ARE PLAYING MAY HAVE A LEGITIMATE HAND AND YOU COULD END UP LOSING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF YOUR CHIPS
H_fDFWaPmZ8_13 0 BE VERY VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU BLUFF
gkyD3XAO78k_1 0 WHENEVER YOU PURCHASE FRESH FLOWERS YOU WANT TO ENJOY THEM AS LONG AS POSSIBLE SO USUALLY YOU GET A PACKAGE OF PRESERVATIVE SUCH AS THIS BUT THE BEST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS ADD THIS TO IT
gkyD3XAO78k_2 0 AND THERE'S OTHER THINGS YOU CAN ADD YOU CAN ADD A LITTLE BIT OF BLEACH YOU CAN ADD SEVEN UP OR LIKE A CITRIC ACID BIG SODA YOU KNOW THE CITRIC ACID IS WHAT HELPS TO REHYDRATE FLOWERS
gkyD3XAO78k_3 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THE CONTAINER THAT YOU HAVE THE FLOWERS IN IS FILLED WITH WATER EVERY DAY BECAUSE THE FLOWERS WILL DRINK WATER YOU KNOW THEY'LL DRINK A LITTLE BIT EACH DAY
gkyD3XAO78k_4 0 SO IF THE WATER LEVEL IN THE VASE DROPS BENEATH WHERE THE STEMS ARE THE STEMS ARE GOING TO SEAL UP
gkyD3XAO78k_5 0 SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IN THAT CASE IS TAKE THE STEM OUT OF THE VASE AND GIVE IT ANOTHER FRESH CUT SO THAT YOU'RE OPENING UP THE BASE OF THE STEM AGAIN AND IT'S DRINKING THE WATER O.K
gkyD3XAO78k_6 0 THE FLORAL PRESERVATIVE IS GOOD BECAUSE IT HELPS KEEP THE WATER CLEAN BUT AS LONG AS YOU'RE ADDING WATER AND DUMPING OUT THE DIRTY WATER
gkyD3XAO78k_7 0 THEN YOU KNOW THAT S THE BEST THING FOR THE FLOWERS
gkyD3XAO78k_8 0 THE BLEACH IS PRETTY GOOD BUT YOU KNOW TOO MUCH BLEACH WILL KIND OF DISCOLOR THE FLOWERS SO YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT
gkyD3XAO78k_9 0 AGAIN A LITTLE BIT OF THE PRESERVATIVE IS GOOD BUT NOT TOO MUCH
gkyD3XAO78k_10 0 AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A FRESH CUT AND FRESH WATER

ghvq3QnTvHs_7 0 ESPECIALLY KEEP AN EYE OUT TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY RUB OR WEAR MARK'S THERE TO THAT YOU WILL GIVE YOU AN IDEA THAT THE HARD PLASTIC AND NOT THE SOFT RUBBER IS MAKING CONTACT WITH THE BOTTOM

ghvq3QnTvHs_33 0 AND NOW YOUR CLEANER HAS GOT A NEW SET OF KICKS
hEJ0kxmN6kg_1 0 RULES OF THE TUG
hEJ0kxmN6kg_2 0 A LOT OF TIMES YOU WILL HEAR THAT TUG IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR A DOG BECAUSE IT WILL ENTICE THEM TO BITE AS HARD AS THEY CAN AND PULL SO IF YOU HAVE A NIPPING PROBLEM WITH A DOG OBVIOUSLY THIS MAY NOT BE THE TOY OR THE GAME OF CHOICE
hEJ0kxmN6kg_3 0 BUT IF THAT IS NOT THE CASE YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH TUG AS LONG AS YOU SET UP RULES
hEJ0kxmN6kg_4 0 FIRST IT IS GOING TO BE ONE ITEM THAT TUG PLAYS WITH AND THAT'S IT
hEJ0kxmN6kg_5 0 SO THIS IS IT IT IS NOT GOING TO BE ANOTHER TOY AND IT IS NOT GOING TO BE ANY OTHER TYPE OF ITEM
hEJ0kxmN6kg_6 0 YOU ARE THE ONE THAT BRINGS IT OUT AND INITIATES THE GAME AND YOU ARE THE ONE THAT ENDS THE GAME
hEJ0kxmN6kg_7 0 WHEN I'M PLAYING TUG I WILL PERIODICALLY HAVE MY DOG STOP AND AS SOON AS HE LETS GO I'LL HAVE HIM SIT LOOK UP AT ME AND THEN THAT STARTS THE GAME AGAIN
hEJ0kxmN6kg_8 0 THIS WILL KEEP THE DOG TO WHERE YOU ARE IN CONTROL WHERE IT IS NOT GETTING OUT OF HAND WHERE THE DOG IS JUMPING UP AND NIPPING OR BITING AND AGAIN GRABBING WITH HIS MOUTH AS HARD AS HE CAN
hEJ0kxmN6kg_9 0 SO IT IS A NICE WAY TO TRAIN YOUR DOG TO HAVE GOOD SKILLS TO CALM DOWN WHEN THE GAME STARTS AND WHEN IT STOPS

gs-RHtZ6hLM_1 0 I'M TOM SHEAN AND TODAY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO INSTALL A METAL ROOF
gs-RHtZ6hLM_2 0 THE SHAKE PANELS ARE TERMINATED BY BENDING OVER THE GABLE FASCIA AT APPROXIMATELY TWO INCHES
gs-RHtZ6hLM_3 0 PLACE THE SHAKE CAP OVER THE GABLE ALIGNING A PROFILE IN THE CAP WITH THE NOSE OF THE SHAKE TILE
gs-RHtZ6hLM_4 0 HOLD THE SHAKE CAP PLUME WITH THE FASCIA AND LEVEL WITH THE PLANE OF THE ROOF AND FASTEN DOWN TO THE TOP LEG INTO THE BATTENS
gs-RHtZ6hLM_5 0 SNIP THE TOP LEG OF THE CAP 3/4 OF AN INCH FLUSH WITH EACH FRONT DOWN TURN OF THE PANELS AND THEN THE LEG OF THE TRIM DOWN TIGHT TO THE TILE TO CLOSE THIS GAP
gs-RHtZ6hLM_6 0 IN HIGH WIND AREAS WE RECOMMEND THAT AN ADDITIONAL FASTENER BE PLACED THROUGH THE SIDE INTO THE FASCIA
gs-RHtZ6hLM_7 0 AT THE EAVE CUT THE END AND FOLD CLOSED
gs-RHtZ6hLM_8 0 FGW IS INSTALLED ALONG THE GABLE FASCIA OVER THE 1X2
gs-RHtZ6hLM_9 0 MEASURE FOR THE CUT PANEL ALLOWING FOR A 1/2 INCH OVERHANG AND A TWO TO TWO 1/2 INCH FOLD
gs-RHtZ6hLM_10 0 NOTCH THE PANEL AT THE OVERHANG MARKS REMOVING THE FRONT AND BACK UP STANCE
gs-RHtZ6hLM_11 0 PLACE THE PANEL IN THE SHAKE BREAK FLUSH WITH THE BACK EDGE AND MAKE THE TAPPER FOLD
gs-RHtZ6hLM_12 0 INSTALL AND FASTEN IN THE PANELS IN THE NORMAL FASHION
gs-RHtZ6hLM_13 0 AFTER FASTENING TAP THE CORNERS AND THE EDGES OF THE TAPERED FOLD SLIGHTLY TO ADJUST AND CLOSE THE GAPS
gs-RHtZ6hLM_14 0 EXPOSED CUTS SHOULD THEN BE SEALED WITH ACRYLIC AND GRANULES
gyHGz-COH-E_1 0 OKAY FOLKS IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DRAW A MOTORCYCLE
gyHGz-COH-E_2 0 NOW WHAT I SUGGEST YOU DO IS GET A GOOD PENCIL CAUSE A MOTORCYCLE IS A VERY COMPLICATED PIECE OF MACHINERY AND YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DEFINITELY SKETCH THE FIRST INITIAL DRAWING IN AS OPPOSE TO GOING OVER THE FINAL THING WITH A MARKER
gyHGz-COH-E_3 0 I WOULD SUGGEST SKETCHING IN THE DESIGN THAT YOU WANT TO FIRST AND THEN ONCE YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH YOUR DESIGN THEN YOU TAKE IT AND DO WHAT EVER YOU WANT TO
gyHGz-COH-E_4 0 SO WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL START HERE
gyHGz-COH-E_5 0 I'M GOING TO DRAW THE OUTER WHEEL FIRST OBVIOUSLY SINCE WE'RE USING PENCIL WE CAN ALWAYS COME IN AND MAKE THIS BIG OR LITTLE AS I WANT TO LATER AND THIS WILL BE TO THE ACTUAL BIKE ITSELF
gyHGz-COH-E_6 0 NOW I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE AGAIN FOR YOU CONNOISSEUR'S WHO KNOW THE EXACTLY THE NAMES FOR ALL THESE PARTS ARE
gyHGz-COH-E_7 0 I JUST GO OFF OF WHAT I SEE SO I AM NOT BY ANY MEANS A MECHANIC SO I CAN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT EACH PART IS AND WHAT IT'S FOR BUT I CAN DEFINITELY DRAW WHAT IT LOOKS SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
gyHGz-COH-E_8 0 I'M COMING UP HERE TO THE HANDLE OF THE BIKE THE HANDLES ARE IMPORTANT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE THESE STAND OUT
gyHGz-COH-E_9 0 THEY ALMOST I WOULD SAY THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE BIKE
gyHGz-COH-E_10 0 SO COME IN AND REALLY CLEARLY DEFINE THOSE HANDLES GIVE THEM THE LOOK THAT YOU WANT EXACTLY
gyHGz-COH-E_11 0 NEXT I WOULD COME DOWN START TO DRAW THE FRAME THAT THE BIKE REST ON AND WHERE THE ENGINE WOULD BE
gyHGz-COH-E_12 0 AGAIN I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE FOR NOT KNOWING THE EXACT TERM THE OTHER THING ABOUT THIS THE OTHER THING I NOTICE WHEN I WAS DRAWING DIFFERENT TYPES OF MOTORCYCLES IS YOU'RE CONSTANTLY ADJUSTING THESE
gyHGz-COH-E_13 0 IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT IT YOU'LL SEE OKAY I KIND OF WISH I'D MADE THAT A LITTLE BIT BIGGER OR A LITTLE BIT SMALLER AND I WISH I'D ADDED MORE DETAIL HERE AND LESS DETAIL THERE
gyHGz-COH-E_14 0 SO WHAT THIS ALLOWS IT'S KIND OF SKETCHING OBVIOUSLY IT ALLOWS YOU TO GO IN MAKE A ROUGH DESIGN NOT BE COMMITTED NECESSARILY TO ANY THING IN PARTICULAR AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO BACK AN ADJUST THINGS AS YOU NEED
gyHGz-COH-E_15 0 SO I'M GOING TO MOVE MY WAY OVER TO THE BACK OF THE BIKE NOW SO WE DRAW THE BACK WHEEL AGAIN WE'RE DRAWING IN PERSPECTIVE HERE SO THE BACK WHEEL WILL BE SMALLER THAN THE FRONT WHEEL AS YOU CAN SEE
gyHGz-COH-E_16 0 AND I'M GOING TO DRAW SORT OF THE BIG PIECES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT LIKE SAY THE EXHAUST PIPE WHICH WILL COME RIGHT ALONG THE BASE AND THEN COME UP AND OUT
gyHGz-COH-E_17 0 OVER THE BACK WHEEL GIVE IT A NICE LITTLE EFFECT A NICE LITTLE CLOUD BEHIND IT JUST LIKE THAT
gyHGz-COH-E_18 0 THEN WHAT WE'LL DO IS FOCUS ON THE BIKE ITSELF COME IN HERE REALLY START TO ADD THE DETAIL AND CLEARLY DEFINE THE LINES OF THE BIKE STARTING WITH THE WHEEL
gyHGz-COH-E_19 0 REALLY GIVE IT A SET WHEEL WITH SOME CLEAR CUT DEFINITION
gyHGz-COH-E_20 0 NOW THE OTHER THING ABOUT BIKES IS OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE WHO KNOW MOTORCYCLES AND WANT TO DRAW MOTORCYCLES HAVE A VERY VERY SPECIFIC LOOK IN MIND BECAUSE THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE THEIR FAVORITE TYPES OF BIKES SO THEY DON'T WANT SOME GUY COMING IN HERE HEY THAT'S MY DEFINITION OF A MOTORBIKE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO ADD YOUR OWN FLAVOR WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY I SAY DO IT MAKE IT YOUR OWN CUSTOM THIS IS YOUR OWN LITTLE CUSTOM SHOP
gyHGz-COH-E_21 0 MAKE THIS THING EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT IT TO BE
gyHGz-COH-E_22 0 ONE THING I WOULD SUGGEST DOING THOUGH UNLESS YOU'RE JUST AN ENGINE FANATIC THE ENGINE PORTION WHICH USUALLY REST UNDERNEATH THE SEAT MAKE IT AS VAGUE AND AMBIGUOUS AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT UNLESS YOU'RE TRYING TO DESIGN THE LOOK OF AN ENGINE IN WHICH CASE I SAY GO NUTS BUT UNLESS THAT'S YOUR OBJECTIVE DO NOT GO INTO MUCH DETAIL WITH THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL BE SO DISTRACTED BY WHAT IT IS THEY WON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO LOOK AT HONESTLY THEY'LL BE VERY VERY CONFUSED BY IT
gyHGz-COH-E_23 0 THE BIGGEST THING WHEN DRAWING MOTORCYCLES MAKE SURE TO DEFINE THE OVERALL SHAPE OF IT AND MAKE SURE PEOPLE ALSO UNDERSTAND YOUR DIMENSION'S
gyHGz-COH-E_24 0 AND ONE WAY YOU CAN HELP THEM WITH THAT IS ONCE YOU'RE DONE SAY THIS IS SORT OF A PRE- VISUAL SKETCH AND YOU'RE TRYING TO SHOW THEM ROUGHLY WHAT THE BIKE WILL LOOK LIKE ONCE IT'S IN MOTION AND ONCE IT HAS PEOPLE
gyHGz-COH-E_25 0 DRAW A OBVIOUSLY ONCE YOU HAVE TO BIKE LOOKING ROUGHLY THE WAY YOU WANT IT TO DRAW AN AMBIGUOUS SORT OF A STICK FIGURE PERSON TO SIT ON THE BIKE AND SHOW THESE PEOPLE ROUGHLY WHAT IT'LL LOOK LIKE TO HAVE A PERSON RIDING ON THE BIKE
gyHGz-COH-E_26 0 NOW OBVIOUSLY IF YOU WANTED TO HAVE A PERSON ON THE BIKE FROM THE GET GO THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE BUT SINCE WE WANTED TO SHOW WHAT A BIKE WOULD LOOK LIKE ADDING A AMBIGUOUS LOOKING TEMP FIGURE IS A GREAT WAY TO SHOW PEOPLE WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO DO
gyHGz-COH-E_27 0 OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN ADD AS MUCH DETAIL TO THIS FIGURE AS YOU LIKE BUT THIS ROUGHLY SHOWS HOW BIG THE BIKE IS SUPPOSE TO BE IN RELATION TO PEOPLE

hDQlQextd_c_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT LEARNING FRACTIONS
hDQlQextd_c_2 0 WELL LEARNING FRACTIONS IS LIKE ANYTHING ELSE IN MATHEMATICS YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE O.K
hDQlQextd_c_3 0 AND MOST PEOPLE ARE INTIMIDATED BY FRACTIONS BUT THEY'RE JUST NUMBERS
hDQlQextd_c_4 0 THEY'RE ALL NUMBERS THAT ARE LESS THAN ONE FOR EXAMPLE IF I WRITE THREE THREE OVER FIVE THIS FROM OUR LAST CLIP WE SAID WAS A PROPER FRACTION BECAUSE THE NUMERATOR IS SMALLER THAN THE DENOMINATOR
hDQlQextd_c_5 0 AND ALL PROPER FRACTIONS EVERY SINGLE FRACTION THAT YOU CAN THINK OF PROPER FRACTION FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE ONE THOUSAND OVER SEVEN THOUSAND SINCE THAT'S A PROPER FRACTION AGAIN WHAT'S A PROPER FRACTION
hDQlQextd_c_6 0 WHEN THE NUMBER ON TOP IS SMALLER THAN THE NUMBER ON THE BOTTOM
hDQlQextd_c_7 0 ALL PROPER FRACTIONS ARE ALWAYS LESS THAN ONE AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED FRACTIONS CAUSE THEIR PART OF A WHOLE O.K
hDQlQextd_c_8 0 THIS IS ONE THOUSAND PARTS OUT OF A TOTAL OF SEVEN THOUSAND PARTS JUST LIKE WHEN YOU WRITE ONE OUT OF FOUR IS ONE PART OUT OF FOUR PARTS
GnaTlkv9JCY_1 0 HI MY NAME IS MIKE SANDERS AND I'M GOING TO BE TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT BODY BOARD FOR YOU
GnaTlkv9JCY_2 0 WHAT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO WITH BODY BOARDS IS YOUR WEIGHT YOUR HEIGHT AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON THE WAVES.IF YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BE FLOUNDERING AROUND IN THE WHITE WATER ALL YOU REALLY NEED IS SOMETHING TO HOLD YOU UP AND KEEP YOU AFLOAT
GnaTlkv9JCY_3 0 NOW ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE OUT WHERE THE WAVES ARE BREAKING YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A LITTLE STURDIER BOTTOM OF A BOARD
GnaTlkv9JCY_4 0 YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT CAN HOLD IT'S RAIL AND KEEP YOU IN CONTROL OF THE WAVE
GnaTlkv9JCY_5 0 ONE THING THAT I'VE NOTICED ABOUT BODY BOARDS IS IF YOU GET A BAD ONE FROM A GARAGE SALE
GnaTlkv9JCY_6 0 THE TOP IS ALL WORN OFF AND IT MAY SEEM LIKE A GOOD DEAL FOR FIVE BUCKS THEN BUT YOU TAKE IT OUT A COUPLE OF TIMES AND THE RASH ON YOUR STOMACH WILL SAY OTHERWISE
GnaTlkv9JCY_7 0 YOU REALLY GOT TO BE CAREFUL
GnaTlkv9JCY_8 0 YOU DON'T WANT IT TOO SLICK BECAUSE YOU'LL BE SLIDING ALL OVER THE PLACE
GnaTlkv9JCY_9 0 SOME PEOPLE WAX THEM UP
GnaTlkv9JCY_10 0 I LIKE TO KEEP THEM CLEAN BUT YOU ALSO DON'T WANT IT TOO ROUGH BECAUSE THEN YOU GET RASHES WHEN YOU GO OUT JUST YOUR BODY SO REALLY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR FLOATABILITY
GnaTlkv9JCY_11 0 THESE BOOGIE BOARDS THAT THEY HAVE NOW ARE LIKE THEY'RE PRETTY NICE
GnaTlkv9JCY_12 0 THEY'RE PRETTY SMOOTH ON THE BOTTOM
GnaTlkv9JCY_13 0 THEY GET YOU SOME GOOD SPEED
GnaTlkv9JCY_14 0 THEY HAVE SOME NICE RAILS TO HOLD YOU INTO THE WAVE
GnaTlkv9JCY_15 0 THERE'S SOME OLD SPONGE ONES THAT DON'T REALLY DO MUCH FOR YOU IF YOU'RE JUST FLOUNDERING OUT THERE BUT USUALLY THE HARD BOTTOMS ARE THE GOOD CHOICE TO MAKE UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO BE DROPPING IN ON SOME TWENTY FOOT FACES
GnaTlkv9JCY_16 0 THEN YOU MIGHT NEED SOME LITTLE FINS BACK THERE BUT MOSTLY WITH A BODY BOARD YOU'RE DOING MOST OF THE CONTROL WITH YOUR FEET THAT ARE BEHIND YOU
GnaTlkv9JCY_17 0 HOPEFULLY YOU'VE GOT SOME SWIM FINS ON AND MORE OR LESS LEANING INTO THE RAILS IS HOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE TURNING SO WHEN YOU'RE CHOOSING IT YOU WANT TO FLOAT AND YOU WANT TO KEEP IT CONTROLLED AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN YOU'RE CHOOSING A BODY BOARD
HjAvbf8bz78_1 0 CHINESE FENG SHUI MASTERS AS WELL AS MEDITATION MASTERS OBSERVED THAT NOTHING IS STATIC IN THE UNIVERSE
HjAvbf8bz78_2 0 EVERYTHING IS MOVING AND CHANGING EVERYTHING IS ENERGY AND PROBABILITY PATTERNS

HjAvbf8bz78_8 0 CHINESE HOUR HAS TWO HOURS AND THEY ARE ALSO NAMED BY ZODIAC ELEMENTS
HjAvbf8bz78_9 0 LIKE THERE IS HOUR OF THE RAT HOUR OF THE RABBIT HOUR OF THE TIGER AND SO ON
HjAvbf8bz78_10 0 IF YOU KNOW YOUR IF YOU ARE IN A GOOD SUPPORTIVE CYCLE OR NOT IT WILL HELP YOU ACTUALLY TO DETERMINE IS IT GOOD IDEA TO MOVE ON TO GO AHEAD WITH THE PROJECT OR PERHAPS WAIT A LITTLE BIT TO MORE AUSPICIOUS TIME

Hex1F22DDBE_1 0 TINA STULL HI I'M TINA STULL AND I DRIVE THE TOP DRAGSTER FOR INTERSTATE BATTERIES
Hex1F22DDBE_2 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE BASICS OF RACING
Hex1F22DDBE_4 0 SO YOU'RE FINALLY READY TO GO DO YOUR FIRST QUALIFYING PASS
Hex1F22DDBE_5 0 ONCE YOU'RE ALL SUITED IN AND WE WENT THROUGH THAT ON ANOTHER SEGMENT YOU'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD WATCH THE OFFICIAL
Hex1F22DDBE_6 0 HE'LL HAVE YOU PULL UP AND YOU JUST WAIT YOUR TURN
Hex1F22DDBE_7 0 THERE'S USUALLY BE A CAR THAT'S ACTUALLY READY TO GO DOWN THE TRACK
Hex1F22DDBE_8 0 THERE WILL BE ONE SITTING IN THE WATER BOX WAITING FOR THEIR TURN AND THEN YOU'LL BE HELD BACK AT THE LINE
Hex1F22DDBE_9 0 IF YOU JUST WATCH THE OFFICIAL HE'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S YOUR TURN TO GO THROUGH THE WATER BOX
Hex1F22DDBE_10 0 NOW I'M TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT SUPER COMP TOP DRAGSTER AT THIS POINT BECAUSE THE BURN-OUT PROCEDURE IS VERY DIFFERENT FOR ALL DIFFERENT CARS
Hex1F22DDBE_11 0 FOR THE REST [SOUNDS LIKE] WILL WELL THROUGH THE WATER BOX AND COME JUST TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE ON THE OTHER SIDE WHERE OUR TIRES ARE STILL A BIT WET BUT WE'RE UP ON DRY PAVEMENT
Hex1F22DDBE_12 0 YOU'LL WATCH THE OFFICIAL AND HE'LL GIVE YOU THE COMMAND TO ROLL OR TO DO YOUR BURN-OUT
Hex1F22DDBE_13 0 AND FOR MY CAR WE HAVE A LIMITER SWITCH
Hex1F22DDBE_14 0 SO YOU HOLD THE LIMITER SWITCH DOWN
Hex1F22DDBE_15 0 YOU TRANSFER FROM THE BREAK ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE GAS AND IT'S USUALLY ABOUT I WOULD SAY A SECOND AND A HALF
Hex1F22DDBE_16 0 I JUST GO A THOUSAND ONE A THOUSAND TWO COME OFF OF THE THROTTLE
Hex1F22DDBE_17 0 YOU LET GO OF THE LIMITER SWITCH AND YOU LET IT ROLL OUT AND COME TO A STOP
Hex1F22DDBE_18 0 AT THAT POINT I PUT IT IN NEUTRAL AND LET GIVE IT A QUICK JAB TO THE THROTTLE JUST TO CLEAR THE ENGINE OUT THEN YOU'LL HOLD DOWN YOU HAVE TO DO A RELEASE
Hex1F22DDBE_19 0 ALL GEARS ARE DIFFERENT
Hex1F22DDBE_20 0 BUT MINE YOU'LL HAVE A LOCK-UP BUTTON
Hex1F22DDBE_21 0 YOU HIT THAT
Hex1F22DDBE_22 0 YOU PUT IT INTO REVERSE AND YOU BACK UP
Hex1F22DDBE_23 0 WHEN YOU'RE BACKING UP YOU'RE TRYING TO CENTER THE BACK WHEELS OF YOUR TIRE RIGHT THERE IN THE GROOVE AND AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT YOU WORRY ABOUT THE FRONT TIRES
Hex1F22DDBE_24 0 IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REAR END OF THE CAR IS WHERE YOU WANT IT AND NOT BE SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE FRONT END
Hex1F22DDBE_25 0 YOU CAN CORRECT REALLY QUICKLY THE FRONT END OF THE CAR BUT IT TAKES TEN FEET PULLING FORWARD TO CORRECT MORE THAN FOUR INCHES WITH YOUR BACK TIRES
Hex1F22DDBE_26 0 AT THAT POINT YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IT DOWN INTO LOW GEAR AND YOU'RE GOING TO START TO WALK YOUR WAY UP TO THE STAGING LIGHTS
Hex1F22DDBE_27 0 IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO REALLY STAGES FIRST BUT YOU NEED TO BEAT IN A TIMELY MANNER CAUSE THERE ARE TIMERS ON IT THAT IF YOU MAKE THE OTHER PERSON WAIT TOO LONG THEN YOU CAN GET TIMED OUT
Hex1F22DDBE_28 0 THEY SET THEIR TOP BULB YOU SET YOUR TOP BULB AND YOU'RE GOING TO SLOWLY INCH IN TO SETTING YOUR SECOND BULB
Hex1F22DDBE_29 0 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU STAGE AS SHALLOW AS YOU CAN
Hex1F22DDBE_30 0 IF YOU'RE REAL TOO FAR FORWARD YOU CAN RED LIGHT AND IT HAS AN EFFECT ON YOUR NOT ONLY YOUR REACTION TIME BUT ALSO ON YOUR ELAPSED TIME
Hex1F22DDBE_31 0 AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WHATEVER STYLE YOU DO SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO ROLL SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO BUMP BUT THAT YOU DO IT CONSISTENTLY
Hex1F22DDBE_32 0 SO ONCE YOU'VE BOTH BUMPED IN YOU'RE GOING TO PUT YOUR TRANSBRAKE BUTTON ON AND WHEN YOU SEE THOSE LIGHTS FLASH YOU LET GO AND GO FOR A RIDE
Hfz1T9VUUJY_1 0 BRYAN BILLHIMER IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT OUR FIRST SYMBOL HERE AND THAT IS A HALF BEND

Hfz1T9VUUJY_3 0 IT'S AN ARROW POINTING UP AND YOU'LL SEE A HALF SYMBOL THERE
Hfz1T9VUUJY_4 0 AND THEN BELOW HERE SEE IT SAYS BEND HALF STEP
Hfz1T9VUUJY_5 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE BENDING ON GUITAR YOU'RE NOT JUST BENDING TO ANY NOTE
Hfz1T9VUUJY_6 0 YOU'RE ALWAYS BENDING TO A SPECIFIC NOTE
Hfz1T9VUUJY_7 0 IN THIS CASE WHEN IT SAYS HALF WE'RE GOING TO BE BENDING UP A HALF STEP
Hfz1T9VUUJY_8 0 SO ON OUR TABLATURE WE SAW A 12TH FRET ON THE B STRING HALF BEND
Hfz1T9VUUJY_9 0 SO A HALF BEND MEANS YOU BEND A HALF STEP
Hfz1T9VUUJY_10 0 SO A HALF STEP ON GUITAR IS JUST UP ONE STEP ONE FRET
Hfz1T9VUUJY_11 0 SO THE 12TH FRET THE 13TH FRET IS A HALF STEP
Hfz1T9VUUJY_12 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO BEND OUR STRING UP SO THAT WHEN WE BEND THE NOTE IT SOUNDS LIKE THE 13TH FRET
Hfz1T9VUUJY_13 0 SO WE CAN CHECK THAT BY PLAYING THE 13TH FRET
Hfz1T9VUUJY_14 0 THAT'S A HALF BEND
Hfz1T9VUUJY_15 0 NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW I MIGHT USE THAT MAYBE IN A RIFF OR SOMETHING
Hfz1T9VUUJY_16 0 IF I WAS PLAYING LIKE A BLUES LICK I MIGHT GO
Hfz1T9VUUJY_18 0 SO NOW WE GOT THE HALF BEND DOWN
Hfz1T9VUUJY_19 0 IN THE NEXT CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A WHOLE STEP BEND

Hid5cVrg2NQ_10 0 GOOD THING YOU'LL HAVE A CORD FROM YOUR INTERCOM BOX WHICH IS USUALLY LOCATED ON THE WALL
Hid5cVrg2NQ_11 0 A SEPARATE INTERCOM BOX FROM THIS ONE ACTUALLY
Hid5cVrg2NQ_12 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR CORD FROM THAT YOU'LL WANT TO OBVIOUSLY THIS ONE HAS THREE PRONGS IN IT THERE'S AN INPUT HERE THAT HAS THREE HOLES IN IT
Hid5cVrg2NQ_13 0 ONCE AGAIN WE ALL LEARNED THAT THE SQUARE DOESN'T GO IN THE CIRCLE

g7SOoXG_hx8_1 0 IF YOU WANT TO LIVE A LONG AND HEALTHY LIFE ONE THING THAT WILL REALLY HELP YOU IS TO REDUCE STRESS
g7SOoXG_hx8_2 0 CHRONIC STRESS HAS BEEN FOUND IN NUMEROUS STUDIES TO CONTRIBUTE TO A WIDE RANGE OF ILLNESSES AND CONDITIONS INCLUDING ANXIETY DEPRESSION HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE INSOMNIA HEART IRREGULARITIES AND RECENTLY IT'S ALSO BEEN LINKED TO HEART ATTACKS AND HEART DISEASE
g7SOoXG_hx8_3 0 SO AND AND ACTUALLY IT PROBABLY EFFECTS IT CAN PROBABLY EFFECT A LOT OF OTHER DISEASES AND CONDITIONS AS WELL BUT STUDIES JUST HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO IT QUITE YET
g7SOoXG_hx8_4 0 BUT WHAT SCIENTISTS AND RESEARCHERS ARE PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT AT THIS POINT IS THAT CHRONIC STRESS JUST KIND OF HAS AN OVERALL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS
g7SOoXG_hx8_5 0 ONE THING THAT YOU CAN DO TO COMBAT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF STRESS IS TO LEARN BREATHING TECHNIQUES
g7SOoXG_hx8_6 0 THAT'S BEEN FOUND TO BE VERY HELPFUL FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE
g7SOoXG_hx8_7 0 BASICALLY IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE CHRONICALLY STRESSED OUT AND YOU'RE FEELING THAT STRESS LEVEL TO KIND OF YOU'LL TAKE THE CHRONIC STRESS A LOT OF TIMES WHAT IT DOES IS IT RAISES THAT FIGHT OR FLIGHT SYNDROME RESPONSE IN YOUR BODY
g7SOoXG_hx8_8 0 SO TO KIND OF TO KIND OF STOP THAT AND RESET YOUR BODY IS TO BREATHE SLOWLY BECAUSE THAT KIND OF TAKES YOUR BODY OUT OF THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT MODE WHICH IS TO BREATHE SHALLOW FREQUENT BREATHS
g7SOoXG_hx8_9 0 JUST BREATHE SLOWLY HOLD FOR FOUR SECONDS AND BREATHE SLOWLY OUT
g7SOoXG_hx8_10 0 IT'S INCREDIBLE IF YOU DO THAT SEVERAL TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY WHEN YOU START TO FEEL YOUR STRESS LEVEL RISING FOR A FEW MINUTES IT CAN ACTUALLY MAKE QUITE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON YOUR STRESS LEVEL
g7SOoXG_hx8_11 0 SO I'D RECOMMEND TRYING THAT IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE THAT PERSONALITY TYPE THAT'S CHRONICALLY STRESSED OUT
hiIHTYpRh8Y_1 0 OK THE SIXTY DEGREE WEDGE IS REALLY LOFTED AND ONE THING I FORGOT TO MENTION IN PREVIOUS SEGMENTS MAYBE IS THAT IF YOU OPEN THE FACE OF YOUR CLUB IT DOES INCREASE THE LOFT WHICH MEANS IT PUTS THE BALL HIGHER
hiIHTYpRh8Y_2 0 BUT A SIXTY DEGREE CLUB IS PRETTY MUCH THE MOST LOFTED CLUB THAT MOST PEOPLE MOST PLAYERS WILL USE
hiIHTYpRh8Y_3 0 AND SO EVEN WHEN YOU'RE AT A NEUTRAL STANCE A NEUTRAL CLUBFACE EVEN A CLOSED CLUBFACE IT GIVES YOU THE MOST LOFT
hiIHTYpRh8Y_4 0 SO IT GIVES YOU THE MOST OPTIONS IF YOU WANT TO GET A LOT OF LOFT ON THE BALL
hiIHTYpRh8Y_5 0 SO IT'S A GREAT WEAPON AND BECAUSE IT'S SO LOFTED THOUGH IT DOES TAKE A LOT OF PRACTICE TO GET IT TO WHERE YOU HAVE GOOD CONTROL WITH IT BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE COMING UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND YOU'RE LEARNING TO POP IT UP TO A GOOD TO THE RIGHT DISTANCE SO YOU GOT TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THE SIXTY DEGREE CLUB BUT IT'S A GREAT CLUB AND LET'S SEE HOW IT GOES HERE
hiIHTYpRh8Y_6 0 OK AND I NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH IT
hiIHTYpRh8Y_7 0 LET'S SEE HOW WE CAN DO ON THIS ONE
hiIHTYpRh8Y_8 0 NOW THAT'S NICE AND HIGH SO THAT'S VERY CONTROLLED
hiIHTYpRh8Y_9 0 SO THE SIXTY DEGREE WEDGE IS ANOTHER WAY OF LOFTING THE BALL HIGH SO WHEN IT LANDS IT STOPS
hiIHTYpRh8Y_10 0 SO IT'S LIKE THROWING A DART THEORETICALLY IF YOU CAN GET THAT BALL TO A NICE LOFT
hiIHTYpRh8Y_11 0 SO YOU GOT TO BE REAL LOOSE YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR FEET AND YOUR KNEES BENT AND JUST NICE AND RELAXED AND JUST GET UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND LET THE CLUB DO THE WORK AND YOU'LL HAVE GREAT SUCCESS
G78Rzk-pSIw_1 0 NOW I HAVE COMPLETED THE ENTIRE WAXING PROCESS TO THE EYEBROWS
G78Rzk-pSIw_2 0 I'VE SHAPED THEM I'VE CLEANED THEM UP TWEEZED THEM
G78Rzk-pSIw_3 0 A LOT OF TIMES THERE'S A REDNESS LEFT OVER AND IF SOMEONE NEEDS TO GO SOMEWHERE ESPECIALLY RIGHT AFTER YOU'VE WAXED I ALWAYS RECOMMEND A SMALL DAB OF CONCEALER
G78Rzk-pSIw_4 0 JUST PUT IT ON A COTTON AND JUST LIGHTLY GO OVER THE EYEBROWS
G78Rzk-pSIw_5 0 ALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY REACTIONS ANY BUMPS ANY EXCESSIVE REDNESS THAT LASTS MORE THAN FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES IF YOU'VE NOT WAXED YOUR EYEBROWS YOURSELF AND SOMEONE'S DONE IT FOR YOU THEN YOU PROBABLY NEED TO LET YOUR WAXER KNOW BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN MAYBE THE WAX WAS TOO HOT MAYBE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAX THAT THEY CAN USE
G78Rzk-pSIw_6 0 THAT TAKES ALL OF THE REDNESS AWAY GOT TOO MUCH ON THAT SIDE THERE WE GO PERFECT AND NOW MYRA'S EYEBROWS ARE WAXED AND SHE IS READY TO FACE THE WORLD THAT'S NICE AND CLEAN AND NOW YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR NEWLY FRESHLY CLEANED WAXED EYEBROWS
gOLkajVzsEc_1 0 HI I'M PATTI GERMAN AND I'M A LICENSED FAMILY THERAPIST HERE IN NEW YORK CITY
gOLkajVzsEc_2 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO HANDLE A CHEATING GIRLFRIEND
gOLkajVzsEc_3 0 THE FIRST PART IN UNDERSTANDING THAT YOUR GIRLFRIEND IS CHEATING ON YOU IS TO GET PROFESSIONAL HELP
gOLkajVzsEc_4 0 I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN HANDLE THIS ON YOUR OWN
gOLkajVzsEc_5 0 THERE ARE MANY MANY REASONS WHY A PERSON IS NOT STAYING LOYAL IN A RELATIONSHIP
gOLkajVzsEc_6 0 AND THE EXCITEMENT OF SOMEONE ELSE ENTERS INTO IT
gOLkajVzsEc_7 0 SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU SEEK COUNSELING MARRIAGE COUNSELING AT THIS POINT BECAUSE TO TO STOP THE THE PAIN AT THAT POINT A PROFESSIONAL PERSON CAN HELP UNDERSTAND HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE CHEATING
gOLkajVzsEc_8 0 WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE NOT STAYING LOYAL
gOLkajVzsEc_9 0 WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE BETRAY
gOLkajVzsEc_10 0 AND IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME BUT IT'S A TRUE INDICATION THAT A RELATIONSHIP HAS PROBLEMS
gOLkajVzsEc_11 0 SO TO CLARIFY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU GO TO A MARRIAGE COUNCILOR WHETHER YOU'RE MARRIED OR NOT TO HELP UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN A RELATIONSHIP
gOLkajVzsEc_12 0 MARRIAGE COUNCILORS WORK WITH RELATIONSHIPS WHETHER PEOPLE ARE MARRIED OR NOT
gOLkajVzsEc_13 0 THERE'S SOME INDICATION THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM IN THE RELATIONSHIP AND IF IT GOES FORWARD IT'S ONLY GOING TO REPEAT ITSELF AND TRICKLE DOWN IN MANY OTHER AREAS
gOLkajVzsEc_14 0 SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WHEN YOU DISCOVER YOUR GIRLFRIEND IS CHEATING THAT YOU SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP
gOLkajVzsEc_15 0 AGAIN THIS IS PATTI GERMAN IN NEW YORK CITY
GIdjUXyFdz4_1 0 THE NEXT ITEM WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS A STOPWATCH
GIdjUXyFdz4_2 0 NORMALLY THE TIMEKEEPER AT RINGSIDE IS GOING TO BE KEEPING TRACK OF THE TWO MINUTE ROUNDS AND THE MINUTE REST PERIOD IN BETWEEN BUT IF YOU HAVE A HEADS-UP YOURSELF ON APPROXIMATELY WHEN TEN SECONDS IS LEFT IN THE ROUND YOU CAN TRY TO GET YOUR BOXER A LITTLE BIT MORE EXCITED AND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABLE TO FINISH THAT ROUND IN A GOOD POSITIVE WAY
GIdjUXyFdz4_3 0 SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU HAVE YOUR ASSISTANT YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO DO BUT YOU HAVE YOUR ASSISTANT KEEP TRACK OF THE TIME AND WHEN HE REACHES A MINUTE AND FIFTY SECONDS HE CAN SAY TEN SECONDS AND THEN YOU TELL YOUR BOXER TEN SECONDS JOE TEN SECONDS
GIdjUXyFdz4_4 0 THAT ALLOWS THAT BOXER THOSE LAST TEN SECONDS
GIdjUXyFdz4_5 0 THAT'S THE LAST TEN SECONDS THAT THE JUDGES ARE GOING TO SEE
GIdjUXyFdz4_6 0 THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT TEN SECONDS
GIdjUXyFdz4_7 0 IF THAT BOXER KNOW THERE'S ONLY TEN SECONDS LEFT HE MIGHT GET THAT EXTRA LITTLE BIT OF WIND THAT HE NEEDED TO GO BACK OUT THERE AND THEN FINISH STRONG FINISH STRONG OK ALSO WHEN YOU'RE WORKING IN BETWEEN THE ROUNDS IN THE CORNER IF YOUR ASSISTANT CORNER MAN ALSO HAS A STOPWATCH HE CAN ALERT YOU WHEN THERE'S APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SECONDS LEFT TO THE ROUND TO THE IN BETWEEN THE ROUND
GIdjUXyFdz4_8 0 THAT WAY BY THE TIME YOU HEAR THE WORD SECONDS OUT AND YOU ONLY HAVE TEN SECONDS LEFT YOU'VE ALREADY HAD A HEAD START YOU'VE ALREADY PUT YOUR MOUTH PIECE INTO THE BOXER YOU'VE ALREADY GOT HIM READY TO GO
GIdjUXyFdz4_9 0 SO HAVING A GOOD STOPWATCH AND THEN AN ASSISTANT TO HELP YOU KEEP TRACK OF IT IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA
g6yF8fkGiOw_1 0 NEXT I AM GOING TO BE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THE DIFFERENT ANGLES THAT YOU CAN MOUNT YOUR SNOWBOARD WITH
g6yF8fkGiOw_2 0 FIRST YOU ARE GOING TO NEED TO FIND OUT WHICH WAY YOU RIDE AND YOU CAN DO THIS BY HAVING A FRIEND STAND BEHIND YOU AND PUSH ON YOUR SHOULDERS
g6yF8fkGiOw_3 0 WHICHEVER FOOT YOU STEP FORWARD WITH IS GOING TO BE YOUR FRONT FOOT
g6yF8fkGiOw_4 0 IN THIS CASE THIS BOARD IS GOING TO BE SET UP FOR SOMEBODY WHO RIDES REGULAR AND AGAIN YOU ARE GOING TO NEED TO DETERMINE YOUR STANCE BEFORE YOU CAN MOUNT THEM
g6yF8fkGiOw_5 0 THERE ARE A COUPLE OF WAYS TO MOUNT THE BINDINGS BUT THE STANDARD WAY TO DO IT IS WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE FORWARD POSITION SETTING THE BACK FOOT AT A POSITIVE THREE DEGREE ANGLE AND THE FRONT FOOT AT A POSITIVE FIFTEEN DEGREE ANGLE
g6yF8fkGiOw_6 0 THE OTHER DIFFERENT TYPES OF WAYS THAT YOU CAN DO IT IS WHAT IS KNOWN AS PIGEON FOOTED WHEN YOU ANGLE THE BINDINGS FACING IN TOWARDS EACH OTHER DUCK FOOTED WHEN YOU ANGLE THE BINDINGS AWAY FROM EACH OTHER FORWARD WHICH IS THE STANDARD WAY TO DO IT OR YOU CAN ALSO SET IT UP IN THE ALPINE OR RACING POSITION WHICH IS AN EXTREME FORM OF THE FORWARD POSITION WHERE YOU TAKE BOTH BINDINGS AND ALMOST WANT TO MOUNT THEM PARALLEL WITH THE BOARD AND ONCE YOU HAVE DETERMINED THE WAY YOU WANT TO RIDE JUST INSERT YOUR HARDWARE AND YOU ARE ALL SET
h7-N2D2lPm4_1 0 OKAY SO YOU HAVE FLAT-IRONED YOUR HAIR YOU'VE PUT ON A HEADBAND YOU'VE GOT THE SIMPLE MAKEUP YOU'VE GOT A NICE OUTFIT ON THAT'S TASTEFUL BUT STILL FUN
h7-N2D2lPm4_2 0 WHAT ARE THE LAST THINGS THAT YOU ADD TO IT
h7-N2D2lPm4_3 0 YOU WANT TO ADD SOME ACCESSORIES
h7-N2D2lPm4_4 0 THE FIRST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS SHOES
h7-N2D2lPm4_5 0 LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE EXTREME WITH YOUR SHOES WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING TOGETHER A PREPPY LOOK SO I'D SAY KEEP HEELS UNDER TWO AND A HALF THREE INCHES
h7-N2D2lPm4_6 0 THE SHOES SHOULD BE IN A NEUTRAL COLORS SIMILAR TO THE SANDALS THAT I'M WEARING RIGHT NOW
h7-N2D2lPm4_7 0 A NORMAL SMALL HEEL
h7-N2D2lPm4_8 0 ESPADRILLES ARE OKAY WEDGES ARE OKAY BUT IN GENERAL NO TOWERING HEELS NO GRUNGY SHOES EITHER
h7-N2D2lPm4_9 0 WHILE FLIP-FLOPS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE A STAPLE OF THE PREPPY WARDROBE THEY TEND TO BE NICE FLIP-FLOPS OR NICE VERSIONS OF FLATS LIKE THESE SANDALS THAT I'M SHOWING YOU RIGHT HERE
h7-N2D2lPm4_10 0 THESE ARE SOME NICE FLAT GRECIAN SANDALS AND THEY'RE IN A NEUTRAL THERE'S NOT MUCH OF A HEEL THEY'RE A VERY NICE LEATHER I MEAN THESE ARE ACTUALLY THESE ARE PRETTY WORN IN AND THEY STILL LOOK REALLY NICE
h7-N2D2lPm4_11 0 THESE WOULD GO GREAT WITH A SUMMER OUTFIT OF MAYBE POLO SHIRTS AND SHORTS
h7-N2D2lPm4_12 0 THE OTHER PIECE THAT YOU WANT TO ADD THAT'S VERY POPULAR ARE RIBBON BELTS OR GROSS GRAIN BELTS AND YOU COULD PUT THESE OVER ALMOST ANYTHING
h7-N2D2lPm4_13 0 I COULD BELT THE JACKET IF I WANTED TO ADD SOME COLOR IN IT
h7-N2D2lPm4_14 0 IT'S USUALLY IN A STRIPE MAYBE IN A POLKA DOT PATTERN OR A NAUTICAL THEME LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT
h7-N2D2lPm4_15 0 THESE BELTS ARE VERY POPULAR WITH A GENERAL PREPPY LOOK IN THE SUMMER
h7-N2D2lPm4_16 0 AND THE LAST THING WOULD BE BAGS
h7-N2D2lPm4_17 0 NOW SIMILAR TO THE JEWELRY WHEN I TALKED ABOUT SORT OF STATUS JEWELRY YOU'D LIKE MAYBE A SUMMER BAG IN A LIGHT COLOR THIS IS VERY SUBTLE IT HAS A LOGO BUT IT'S NOT AN OBVIOUS LOGO BECAUSE LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN DRESSING PREPPY YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TOO SHOWY
h7-N2D2lPm4_18 0 BUT I WOULD SAY THAT MOST OF THE TIME A BAG LIKE THIS IS A LOT MORE SIMILAR TO WHAT SOMEONE PREPPY MIGHT CARRY
h7-N2D2lPm4_19 0 THIS IS IN A DARK RED BUT YOU COULD HAVE IT IN A BROWN OR IN A TAN IT'S A NICE LEATHER IT'S A CROCODILE WHICH MEANS IT'S A GREAT RELIABLE LEATHER FOR A BAG
h7-N2D2lPm4_20 0 AND IT'S A CLASSIC CUT AND A CLASSIC SHAPE WHICH WOULD REALLY COMPLEMENT THE CLOTHES FOR A PREPPY STYLE

GP4dWDAZCV0_2 0 AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT HOW TO GET OFF A RING THAT'S STUCK ON YOUR FINGER
GP4dWDAZCV0_3 0 SO GET A RING STUCK ON THERE ALL NICE AND TIGHT
GP4dWDAZCV0_4 0 THE FIRST THING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS PUT YOUR HAND OVER YOUR HEAD OR AT LEAST OVER YOUR HEART
GP4dWDAZCV0_5 0 AND WHAT THIS DOES IS STARTS DRAINING THE BLOOD OUT OF YOUR ARM AND OUT OF YOUR HAND AND OUT OF THAT FINGER SO THAT IT'S A LITTLE LESS SWOLLEN
GP4dWDAZCV0_6 0 SO WHILE YOU GOT IT UP THERE THE NEXT THING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS TAKE A COLD COMPRESS AND WRAP IT AROUND YOUR FINGER
GP4dWDAZCV0_7 0 AND THIS WILL START TAKING THE SWELLING DOWN AND START TO GET THE BLOOD AND THE SWELLING AWAY FROM THAT FINGER
GP4dWDAZCV0_8 0 SO WE'RE KIND OF LETTING GRAVITY WORK FOR US HERE
GP4dWDAZCV0_9 0 AND AFTER YOU'VE HAD THAT UP FOR A LITTLE WHILE NEXT THING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS USE SOME KIND OF LUBRICANT
GP4dWDAZCV0_10 0 WHETHER IT'S SOAP VASELINE
GP4dWDAZCV0_11 0 YOU CAN EVEN USE CHAPSTICK IN A PINCH ANYTHING WITH LIKE A PETROLEUM JELLY OR SOME KIND OF LUBRICANT IN IT
GP4dWDAZCV0_12 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO USE DISH SOAP TODAY
GP4dWDAZCV0_13 0 JUST PUT A LITTLE OF THAT ON THERE AND JUST KIND OF WORK IT AROUND THE FINGER TRYING TO GET IT UNDER THE AREA WHERE THE RING IS STUCK
GP4dWDAZCV0_14 0 AND AGAIN LIKE WE USE THE HAND IN THE AIR AND KIND OF USED OUR BIOLOGY TO HELP US GET THAT RING LOOSE WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT AGAIN AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A STRING
GP4dWDAZCV0_15 0 YOU CAN USE ANY KIND OF STRING AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS WRAP IT AROUND YOUR FINGER RIGHT ABOVE WHERE THE RING IS STUCK
GP4dWDAZCV0_16 0 AND WHAT THIS IS GOING TO DO IS WORK LIKE A COMPRESS THAT'S GOING TO HELP TAKE THE SWELLING OUT OF THAT AREA
GP4dWDAZCV0_17 0 SO YOU DON'T WANT TO WRAP IT SO TIGHT THAT YOUR FINGER IS BLUE
GP4dWDAZCV0_18 0 JUST TIGHT ENOUGH SO IT STARTS TAKING OUT THE SWELLING
GP4dWDAZCV0_19 0 AND THIS IS A SIMILAR IDEA THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE USE LIKE IF THEY'RE DIABETICS OR HAVE SWELLING ISSUES WHERE THEY PUT COMPRESSES ON THEIR LEGS
GP4dWDAZCV0_20 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE IT ON THERE FOR JUST A BIT
GP4dWDAZCV0_21 0 AND TAKE THAT OFF AND THAT'LL TAKE DOWN THE SWELLING IN THE AREA JUST ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN GET THAT RING LOOSE
GP4dWDAZCV0_22 0 AND JUST A REMINDER ON THIS IS YOU DO HAVE A SWELLING CONDITION OR YOUR FINGER'S TURNING BLUE IT'S TIME TO BYPASS ALL OF THESE AND GO AHEAD AND GO TO THE DOCTOR OR GO TO A JEWELER THAT CAN CUT THE RING OFF YOUR HAND

Gu7TP21WqvM_1 0 TODAY WE'LL BEING TALKING ABOUT THE HI-HAT
Gu7TP21WqvM_2 0 THE HI-HAT CAN BE USED A LOT OF TIMES IT'S UNDERESTIMATED HOW MUCH IT CAN BE USED TO CHANGE THE FEEL OF THE SONG
Gu7TP21WqvM_3 0 THERE'S A LOT OF FOCUS ON PLAYING THE SNARE AND THE BASS DRUM IN CONJUNCTION WITH EACH OTHER
Gu7TP21WqvM_4 0 BUT REALLY THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN BE DONE WITH THE HI-HAT
Gu7TP21WqvM_5 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS LOOK A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS WE CAN DO WITH THE HI HAT FROM ACCENTING IT TO OPENING IT AND CLOSING IT TO PLAYING WITH BOTH HANDS ON IT
Gu7TP21WqvM_6 0 SO REALLY THE FOCUS OF THIS WILL BE ON THE HI-HAT
Gu7TP21WqvM_7 0 WE'RE GOING TO KIND OF SET OURSELVES UP WITH A BASS AND SNARE DRUM PATTERN AND REALLY SEE WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THAT HI-HAT
Gu7TP21WqvM_8 0 IDEALLY YOU WANT TO HAVE A WORKING HI-HAT STAND WITH A VARYING DEGREE OF OPENNESS TO REALLY LET YOU GET THE MOST OUT OF IT AND YOU ALSO WANT TO HAVE YOUR HI-HAT POSITIONED IN A COMFORTABLE WAY
Gu7TP21WqvM_9 0 THE WAY I HAVE IT ON MY DRUM SET BECAUSE I HAVE A DOUBLE PEDAL HERE IS I HAVE IT OFF A LITTLE BIT TO MY LEFT
Gu7TP21WqvM_10 0 IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL TO ME BECAUSE I'M AN OPEN HANDED DRUMMER I PLAY THIS WAY AND IT'S ALSO LOW ENOUGH FOR ME BECAUSE I PLAY OPEN HANDED IT'S JUST ABOUT THE HEIGHT OF THE SNARE
Gu7TP21WqvM_11 0 SOMEONE WHO PLAYS CROSSING OVER WOULD BE LIKELY TO HAVE THE HI-HAT HIGHER AND MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE FURTHER OVER TO THE LEFT
Gu7TP21WqvM_12 0 MAYBE NEAR WHERE MY RIDE CYMBAL IS
Gu7TP21WqvM_13 0 MAKE SURE TO HAVE HAVE THE HI-HAT AT A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN COMFORTABLY PLAY WITH BOTH HANDS ON IT AND GET THE SNARE WITH BOTH HANDS ALSO
hi4TMDAaGw8_1 0 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR THE ADHD ADULTS
hi4TMDAaGw8_2 0 I'LL START BY TALKING ABOUT PRESCRIPTION OPTIONS JUST BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST WELL KNOWN TO PEOPLE
hi4TMDAaGw8_3 0 IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR PEOPLE WITH MY GENERATION TO HAVE GROWN UP WITH A NUMBER OF CLASSMATES WHO WERE ON RIDDLIN
hi4TMDAaGw8_4 0 I HAPPEN TO COME FROM THE PART OF THE COUNTRY THAT HAD THE MOST KIDS ON RIDDLIN DURING THE EIGHTIES
hi4TMDAaGw8_5 0 AND IT WAS A SORT OF THING WHERE YOU COULD SEE FOR SOME KIDS HOW IT WAS EFFECTIVE
hi4TMDAaGw8_6 0 ESPECIALLY IF YOU SAW THEM BEFORE THEY EVER TOOK THE MEDICATION
hi4TMDAaGw8_7 0 AND THESE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO ADULTS AS WELL
hi4TMDAaGw8_8 0 AS I MENTIONED RIDDLIN WHICH IS GENERICALLY KNOWN AS METHYLPHENIDATE CAN BE A PRIME METHOD OF TREATMENT
hi4TMDAaGw8_9 0 CONCERTA WOULD BE ANOTHER LONG ACTING FORM OF METHYLPHENIDATE
hi4TMDAaGw8_10 0 AND IT'S A STIMULANT
hi4TMDAaGw8_11 0 IT CAUSES ACTIVITY TO INCREASE IN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX WHICH INSTEAD OF BEING STIMULATING AND DISTRACTING FOR SOMEBODY WITH ADHD WHICH ACTUALLY IS A CALMING AND FOCUSING THING
hi4TMDAaGw8_12 0 ADDERALL IS ANOTHER TREATMENT
hi4TMDAaGw8_13 0 AND THAT'S A COMBINATION OF AMPHETAMINE SALTS
hi4TMDAaGw8_14 0 ADDERALL IS ALMOST MORE WELL KNOWN AS A DRUG OF ABUSE
hi4TMDAaGw8_15 0 WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE IT CAN BE A PART OF AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR AN ADULT WITH ADHD
hi4TMDAaGw8_16 0 AND AGAIN IT'S ANOTHER STIMULANT WHICH INCREASES ACTIVITY IN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX
hi4TMDAaGw8_17 0 ADHD ADULTS MAY ALSO BENEFIT FROM CERTAIN ANTI DEPRESSANTS THAT CAUSE DIFFERENT ACTIVITY WITHIN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX IN TERMS OF DOPAMINE RE-UPTAKE
hi4TMDAaGw8_18 0 SO THERE'S MORE DOPAMINE THAT YOUR NEUROTRANSMITTERS ARE SOAKING IN
hi4TMDAaGw8_19 0 STRATTERA IS A NON STIMULANT OR NON TRADITIONAL STIMULANT OPTION
hi4TMDAaGw8_20 0 AND THAT INVOLVES INHIBITING RE-UPTAKE OF NOREPINEPHRINE WHICH IS FOUND IN TO BE HELPFUL IN ADULTS WITH ADHD
hi4TMDAaGw8_21 0 IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR AN ADHD ADULT WHO HAS DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY ISSUES TO HAVE THOSE COMORBIDITIES PROPERLY TREATED
hi4TMDAaGw8_22 0 SUBSTANCE ABUSE FALLS INTO THIS TOO
hi4TMDAaGw8_23 0 AND THAT'S WHY FOR SOME ADHD PATIENTS IT'S ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR DEPRESSION AND THEIR ANXIETY TO BE MANAGED
hi4TMDAaGw8_24 0 SO THEY CAN ELIMINATE THOSE FACTORS AS DISTRACTIONS IN TREATING THEIR ADHD
hi4TMDAaGw8_25 0 AND HAVE AN OVERALL BETTER FEELING ABOUT THEMSELVES IN THE LIFE THEY LEAD
hgZiIrxQPvk_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'LL LOOK AT A TECHNIQUE THAT WE CAN USE TO STIMULATE THE INTESTINES AND THE MOVEMENT OF DIGESTION AND STIMULATING THE COLON
hgZiIrxQPvk_2 0 SO IF YOU'VE HAD A LONG WINTER WITH NOT MUCH ACTIVITY AND MAYBE A HEAVY DIET THINGS CAN GET STAGNANT SO THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO KEEP THINGS MOVING
hgZiIrxQPvk_3 0 THIS WOULD BE COUNTER-INDICATED IF THINGS ARE MOVING TOO QUICKLY FOR YOUR DIGESTIVE TRACT BUT IF THINGS ARE NORMAL TO SLOW THEN YOU CAN USE THIS TECHNIQUE
hgZiIrxQPvk_4 0 BASICALLY YOU JUST NEED A YOGA BLOCK AND YOU'LL SIT ON ANY SURFACE ANY FIRM SURFACE A YOGA MAT HELPS
hgZiIrxQPvk_5 0 YOU'LL PLACE THE BLOCK ON ITS TALL END IN THE ABDOMEN EITHER JUST ABOVE THE PUBIC BONE OR JUST BELOW THE RIBS AND YOU CAN DO IT IN BOTH PLACES
hgZiIrxQPvk_6 0 WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL PUT THE EDGE OF THE BLOCK ON THE FLOOR AND WE'LL USE OUR BODY WEIGHT AND LAY ON THE BLOCK SUPPORTING YOURSELF WITH YOUR ARMS
hgZiIrxQPvk_7 0 YOU'LL FEEL SOME PRESSURE
hgZiIrxQPvk_8 0 YOU'LL JUST WANT TO BREATHE INTO THE BLOCK AND TAKE YOUR TIME TO RELAX INTO THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY LAYING OVER THE BLOCK
hgZiIrxQPvk_9 0 YOU CAN SEE I'VE GOT IT ON AN ANGLE
hgZiIrxQPvk_10 0 I CAN CONTROL THAT ANGLE BY MOVING MY WEIGHT FORWARD EVEN MORE FORWARD SO IT ANGLES THE OTHER DIRECTION
hgZiIrxQPvk_11 0 ULTIMATELY YOU JUST WANT TO LET THE HEAD RELAX AND LET THE BODY RELAX AND LET THE PRESSURE FEEL GOOD
hgZiIrxQPvk_12 0 THIS IS ALSO A GREAT WAY TO SOFTEN THE TISSUES OF THE ABDOMEN
hgZiIrxQPvk_13 0 WE HOLD A LOT OF TENSION IN ALL THE SOFT TISSUES OF THE ORGANS AND SO IF YOU HAVE HARDNESS OR STIFFNESS OR A FEELING OF CONGESTION IN THIS PART OF THE BODY THIS HELPS TO JUST SOFTEN THAT AREA WHETHER YOU NEED HELP WITH DIGESTION OR ELIMINATION OR YOU JUST NEED TO RELAX THERE
GF0eCUV3ACQ_1 0 ALRIGHT SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NOW IS WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A LITTLE A LITTLE PLATE TYPE OF THING FOR ALL THIS TO SIT ON LIKE A LIKE A LITTLE NESTING PLATE OR THESE LITTLE YOU CAN KEEP THEM ALL NICE IN A CHINA CABINET

GF0eCUV3ACQ_4 0 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE THAT IT WENT STRAIGHT THROUGH NOW WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS JUST TRICKY BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO WANT TO COME OFF OF THE BAT YOU WANT TO SLOWLY GATHER ALL THIS CLAY AND MEANWHILE PRESSING FIRMLY DOWN ON THE BAT LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN HEAR ME BUSTING THROUGH THOSE AIR BUBBLES SO I'M BASICALLY MAKING LIKE A RING RIGHT NOW
GF0eCUV3ACQ_5 0 I'M ALL THE WAY DOWN ON THE BAT AND I'M PINCHING PINCHING THROUGH THOSE AIR BUBBLES AND I'M DRAGGING THIS OUT BUT DRAG IT OUT SLOWLY BECAUSE NOW THAT WE'RE AT WHERE WE HAVE A HOLLOW THING HERE THESE HAVE A TENDENCY OF FALLING OFF OF THE BAT THERE

H4aaHtTUHsM_9 0 AND THE THINGS TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH PRESSURE YOU'RE GOING TO REMOVE THE RIDGES IN THE NAIL IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON THE SIZE OF THE RIDGE
H4aaHtTUHsM_10 0 SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD A LITTLE MORE PRESSURE CAUSE SHE HAS LIKE AN ARTIFICIAL NAIL RIGHT ON THE EDGE THERE SO I'M GOING TO JUST GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE PRESSURE AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL OVER IT JUST TO FEEL ONCE YOU DON'T FEEL ANY MORE BUMPS THEN YOU CAN START WITH YOUR BUFFER AND CONTINUE UNTIL YOU'VE GOT IT USED ALL THREE SIDES

GportE3FvMo_10 0 ANOTHER THING I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT IS THE TONGUE POSITION AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS GOING TO SOUND A LITTLE WEIRD BUT JUST TRY IT OUT
GportE3FvMo_11 0 SWALLOW AND KEEP THE TONGUE IN THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH KEEP YOUR MOUTH CLOSED JUST LIKE AS IF YOU WERE QUIET AT HOME YOU KNOW AT CHURCH OR SOMETHING JUST LISTENING SO I AM NOT GOING TO TALK THROUGHOUT THIS SO I CAN SHOW YOU THE PROPER FORM
GportE3FvMo_12 0 I AM GOING TO INHALE SO I INHALE DOWN AND EXHALE UP
GportE3FvMo_13 0 IF YOU NOTICE I AM NOT LETTING MY SHOULDERS DO THIS KEEP THE SHOULDERS DOWN CURL THE HEAD AND THEN YOU LIFT THEN YOU LOWER AND YOU UNCURL SO THAT IS THE PROPER TECHNIQUE FOR A ROLL UP
GportE3FvMo_14 0 AND THIS IS WORKING YOUR UPPER ABDOMINAL AREA WITH EVERYTHING ELSE THAT I HAVE SHOWN YOU FOR THE LOWER ABS AND THE MIDDLE ABS
GportE3FvMo_15 0 BEFORE YOU KNOW IT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE ABS OF STEEL
h9n26LeM0X4_2 0 MY NAME IS LESLIE MOSELLE AND I AM FROM TAMPA FLORIDA
h9n26LeM0X4_3 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE THIS IS HOW TO DO LAUNDRY
h9n26LeM0X4_4 0 THE NEXT LOAD WE HAVE IS OUR COLORED CLOTHES
h9n26LeM0X4_5 0 NOW WE WASHED THEM IN OUR COLD WATER AND NOW YOU WANT TO DRY THEM IN THE SAME SETTINGS OF YOUR WHITE CLOTHES
h9n26LeM0X4_6 0 THESE TWO LOADS REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY DIFFERENCES WHEN IT COMES TO DRYING
h9n26LeM0X4_7 0 YOU HAVE YUOUR TWO OPTIONS ONCE AGAIN
h9n26LeM0X4_8 0 YOUR AUTOMATIC DRYER ON LOW HEAT
h9n26LeM0X4_9 0 YOU COULD HAVE IT ON VERY DRY OR LESS DRY DEPENDING ON HOW WET THEY ARE WHEN THEY ARE COMING OUT OF THE WASHER AND WE HAVE THE TIMED DRY WITH HIGH HEAT AND YOU ARE GOING TO PUT AS MUCH TIME IN IT AS YOUR WANT
h9n26LeM0X4_10 0 IF YOU HAVE A LARGER LOAD YOU HAVE UP TO AN HOUR TO HAVE YOUR CLOTHES IN THERE
h9n26LeM0X4_11 0 IF YOU HAVE A SMALLER LOAD PUT IT TWENTY TO 25 MINUTES DEPENDING ON HOW LONG YOU THINK THAT IT IS GOING TO GET DRY
h9n26LeM0X4_12 0 NOW COLORED CLOTHES AS OPPOSED TO WHITE CLOTHES YOUR ONE CONCERN IS FADING SO YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE YOUR CLOTHES IN THE DRYER FOR TOO LONG
h9n26LeM0X4_13 0 YOU HAVE TAKEN ALL THAT CARE TO WASH THEM IN COLD WATER SO THAT THERE IS NOT BLEEDING
h9n26LeM0X4_14 0 YOU DON'T TO GO AHEAD AND NEGATE ALL OF THAT ATTENTION BY PUTTING IT INTO THE DRYER FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME WHICH IS GOING TO CAUSE YOUR CLOTHES TO FADE
h9n26LeM0X4_15 0 WHEN YOU ARE WASHING THEM OVER RAND OVER AGAIN THAT ALREADY IS ENOUGH DAMAGE TO YOUR CLOTHES
h9n26LeM0X4_16 0 YOU WANT TO JUST TAKE THAT TIME TO LOOK AT WHICH SETTING YOU THINK ARE GOOD FOR THE CLOTHES
h9n26LeM0X4_17 0 IF THEY ARE EVERY DAYS CLOTHES THAT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER TOO MUCH YOU CAN PUT IT ON THE TIMED DRYING BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT YOUR TIMER ON FOR AN HOUR IF IT IS A SMALL LOAD
h9n26LeM0X4_18 0 THIS IS NOT ONLY WASTING ENERGY BUT IT IS JUST GOING TO DO MORE DAMAGE TO YOUR COLORED CLOTHES
h9n26LeM0X4_19 0 SO THOSE ARE THE OPTIONS
h9n26LeM0X4_20 0 YOU CAN PUT IT ON AUTO DRY OR YOUR TIMER DRY BUT THE CHOICE IS UP TO YOU
h8yFlNScCIQ_1 0 HI SO YOU HAVE A SCREAMING TOOTHACHE
h8yFlNScCIQ_2 0 WELL I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ON HOW YOU CAN PREVENT A TOOTHACHE UNTIL YOU SEE YOUR GENERAL DENTIST
h8yFlNScCIQ_3 0 MY NAME'S MICHELLE AND I'M A DENTAL ASSISTANT WITH SOLUTIONZ
h8yFlNScCIQ_4 0 AND MAINLY A COUPLE OF REASONS AS FAR AS HOW TO PREVENT A TOOTHACHE UNTIL YOU CAN SEE YOUR GENERAL DENTIST IS YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND PURCHASE MAYBE SOME OVER-THE-COUNTER ORAL NUMBING MEDICINE AND SUCH AS ORAJEL
h8yFlNScCIQ_5 0 WHAT THAT WILL DO IS YOU JUST PLACE THE GEL ON YOUR GUMS AND ON THE TOOTH AREA WHERE YOU'RE HAVING THE ACHE FROM
h8yFlNScCIQ_6 0 THAT WILL NUMB THE IS THE AREA FOR A FEW MINUTES BOUT THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE MINUTES AND THEN THEN YOU WOULD WANT TO KEEP REAPPLYING THROUGHOUT THE DAY
h8yFlNScCIQ_7 0 YOU ALSO MIGHT WANT TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE SOME OVER-THE-COUNTER MEDICATION AS FAR AS LIKE TYLENOL ADVIL IBUPROFEN
h8yFlNScCIQ_8 0 ADVIL OR IBUPROFEN IS BEST BECAUSE IT HAS A ANTI-INFLAMMATORY IN IT WHICH WILL HELP WITH ANY INFLAMMATION THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE IN THAT AREA
h8yFlNScCIQ_9 0 BUT UNTIL YOU CAN SEE YOUR GENERAL DENTIST THOSE ARE THE THINGS YOU WANT TO DO BUT YOU DEFINITELY DO WANT TO GO SEE YOUR DENTIST AFTERWARDS SO THEREFORE HE WOULD BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF TOOTHACHE YOU'RE HAVING IF IT'S A GUM PROBLEM OR IF IT'S AN ACTUAL TOOTH PROBLEM AND HE WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF IT FROM THERE
h8yFlNScCIQ_10 0 ONCE AGAIN MY NAME'S MICHELLE AND I JUST EXPLAINED TO YOU ON HOW TO PREVENT A TOOTHACHE UNTIL YOU SEE YOUR GENERAL DENTIST
gPnoD1ZRhnE_1 0 SO THEN THE NEXT OPTION IS FOR PAPERS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IN A SPECIFIC COLOR THAT YOU ARE FLIPPING THROUGH MAGAZINES CAN'T FIND OR LOOKING IN A PAPER STORE AND CAN'T FIND IS TO PAINT THE PAPER YOURSELF
gPnoD1ZRhnE_2 0 THE BEST TYPES OF PAPERS TO USE FOR THESE ARE THE THICKER STOCK PAPERS AGAIN BECAUSE YOU ARE WORKING WITH A WET SURFACE
gPnoD1ZRhnE_3 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S THE TYPE OF PAPER THAT WON'T BUCKLE WON'T FALL APART ON YOU ESPECIALLY THIN PAPERS DRAWING PAPERS FROM A DRAWING PAD USUALLY ARE A LITTLE TOO THIN FOR DOING THIS TYPE OF PAINTING ON
gPnoD1ZRhnE_4 0 SO AS YOU AN SEE HERE I SORT OF HAVE CREATED A VARIETY OF COLORS FOR MYSELF
gPnoD1ZRhnE_5 0 I'VE ALSO DONE OTHER PAINTINGS THAT I DECIDED THAT I WASN'T TO FOUND OF AS A PAINTING AS A WHOLE ON PAPERS AND I'VE CUT OUT DIFFERENT PIECES OR RIPPED OUT DIFFERENT PIECES AND SHAPES SO THAT I CAN USE PAPERS THAT I'VE PAINTED ON MYSELF
gPnoD1ZRhnE_6 0 SO AGAIN YOU HAVE ALL TYPES OF OPTIONS WHEN YOU ARE WORKING WITH PAINTING YOUR OWN PAPER
gPnoD1ZRhnE_7 0 BUT THEN YOU HAVE THE CHOICE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE COLORS THAT YOU'D LIKE AND THE COLORS THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
g5g75qxynPg_1 0 ON THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT APPLYING WATER BASED STAIN TO A PIECE OF MATERIAL
g5g75qxynPg_2 0 IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I'VE USED THE SAME BASIC TECHNIQUE AS I SHOWED WITH THE STAIN EARLIER THE OVERLAPPING CIRCLES
g5g75qxynPg_3 0 BUT AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY SEE WITH THIS PRODUCT IT DOESN'T HAVE A TENDENCY TO RAISE THE GRAIN AS MUCH AS THE OIL BASED STAIN AND IN THE CASE I DIDN'T CONDITION THE WOOD AT ALL
g5g75qxynPg_4 0 SO I'M JUST GOING STRAIGHT ONTO THE WOOD WITH THE STAIN
g5g75qxynPg_5 0 AND YOU CAN POSSIBLY SEE THAT THE COLOR STAYS PRETTY CONSISTENT
g5g75qxynPg_6 0 IT'S JUST YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT WETTER WHICH MEANS YOU YOU HAVE TO USE MORE
g5g75qxynPg_7 0 GO BACK TO YOUR BOTTLE OF STAIN MORE OFTEN TO KEEP IT WET BECAUSE IT WILL SOAK IN VERY READILY TO THE MATERIAL
g5g75qxynPg_8 0 BUT AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S A PRETTY EVEN COAT OF COLOR
g5g75qxynPg_9 0 LET ME GET A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT AND AS COMPARED TO AN UNTREATED PIECE OF WOOD USING AN OIL BASE STAIN
g5g75qxynPg_10 0 SO THIS THIS IS PROBABLY A PRETTY GOOD CHOICE FOR YOU BEGINNERS
H7KZhobxLms_1 0 HI I'M NOE FOR EXPER VILLAGE
H7KZhobxLms_2 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO CUT UP SOME CHICKEN
H7KZhobxLms_3 0 WHAT I'M USING TODAY IS SOME CHICKEN BREAST I HAD IN MY FREEZER BUT YOU CAN USE ANY KIND OF CUT UP CHICKEN
H7KZhobxLms_4 0 YOU CAN USE THIGHS ARE GOOD OR YOU CAN EVEN USE A WHOLE CHICKEN AND THEN CUT IT UP
H7KZhobxLms_5 0 THE AMOUNT JUST DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH YOU'VE GOT
H7KZhobxLms_6 0 WHAT I'VE GOT HERE IS FIVE OR SIX CHICKEN BREASTS AND THAT'LL WORK WELL FOR THIS RECIPE
H7KZhobxLms_7 0 YOU CAN HAVE A FEW MORE THIGHS IF YOU'RE USING THIGHS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AS BIG
H7KZhobxLms_8 0 I'M JUST GOING TO TRIM A LITTLE BIT OF THE FAT JUST TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT HEALTHIER
H7KZhobxLms_9 0 I'M JUST GOING TO CUT THIS INTO SERVING SIZE PIECES LIKE THAT AND LIKE THAT
H7KZhobxLms_10 0 THIS ONE BREAST I JUST CUT INTO THREE PIECES THAT'S GREAT FOR GRILLING OR BROILING
H7KZhobxLms_11 0 I'M GOING TO RETURN THESE PIECES TO THIS SAME BOWL AND THIS IS A PYREX TYPE BOWL WITH A GLASS COVER WHICH IS GOOD FOR MARINATING IN THE FRIDGE
H7KZhobxLms_12 0 JUST PUT THESE ALL BACK IN THERE
H7KZhobxLms_13 0 THEN WE'RE GOING TO POUR OUR MARINADE ON THE TOP OF THIS
H7KZhobxLms_14 0 JUST RIGHT OVER THERE
H7KZhobxLms_15 0 I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS PIECE OF GINGER AND MAKE SURE IT'S IN THE LIQUID THERE
H7KZhobxLms_16 0 MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS AS COVERED AS YOU CAN
H7KZhobxLms_17 0 THEN WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE GLASS COVER ON THIS BOWL AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR THREE TO FOUR HOURS AT LEAST
H7KZhobxLms_18 0 YOU CAN MAKE IT THE NIGHT BEFORE YOU'RE GOING TO COOK IT
H7KZhobxLms_19 0 JUST LEAVE IT IN THE REFRIGERATOR AND HAVE IT FOR DINNER THAT NIGHT
gNrVDwKFfoM_1 0 SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO USE AN IMAGE AS A LINK INSTEAD OF TEXT
gNrVDwKFfoM_2 0 AND SO IN OUR FILE THAT WE JUST HAVE WE'VE GOT THE LINK RIGHT HERE
gNrVDwKFfoM_3 0 AND WE HAVE TEXT AS A LINK
gNrVDwKFfoM_4 0 BUT IF WE WANTED TO SWITCH THAT OUT AND HAVE IT NOT BE TEXT BUT RATHER BE AN IMAGE
gNrVDwKFfoM_5 0 I CREATED A LITTLE BUTTON FILE
gNrVDwKFfoM_6 0 WHICH IS CALLED THE BUTTON DOT GIF AND SO I'M GOING TO GO IN HERE AND ADD IMAGE IN PLACE OF THE TEXT THAT WE HAVE
gNrVDwKFfoM_7 0 SO WE STILL HAVE THE A HREF ALL OF THAT FOR THE LINK
gNrVDwKFfoM_8 0 BUT IN PLACE OF THE TEXT FOR THE LINK ITSELF WE'RE GOING TO GO IMAGE SOURCE EQUALS AND THEN A PARENTHESIS
gNrVDwKFfoM_9 0 AND IT'S CALLED BUTTON DOT GIF AND THEN ANOTHER PARENTHESIS AND BRACKET
gNrVDwKFfoM_10 0 AND SO NOW WE HAVE AN IMAGE FILE CONTAINED WITHIN THE LINK FILE ITSELF
gNrVDwKFfoM_11 0 SO WE'LL SAVE THIS GO OVER HERE DO A PREVIEW
gNrVDwKFfoM_12 0 NOW WE HAVE THIS GO BUTTON
gNrVDwKFfoM_13 0 AND YOU SEE IT'S NOT LINING UP
gNrVDwKFfoM_14 0 WE CAN FIX THAT LATER
gNrVDwKFfoM_15 0 AND IT HAS AN OUTLINE AROUND IT
gNrVDwKFfoM_16 0 WHICH WE ALSO PROBABLY DON'T WANT BUT IF YOU HIT GO
gNrVDwKFfoM_17 0 THERE IT TAKES YOU BACK TO EXPERT VILLAGE
g-FfY0j50sk_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS LIZBETH MULLER FROM LIZ'S HAIR DESIGN IN HOLLYWOOD FLORIDA AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO ROLL AND SET CURLY HAIR
g-FfY0j50sk_2 0 AS I'M GOING INTO MY NEXT SECTION I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE WAYS OF KNOWING IF IT'S NOT RIGHT OR TIGHT
g-FfY0j50sk_3 0 IF YOU GRAB THE HAIR YOU'RE AFRAID OF IT YOU SEE HOW SHE HAS A BEND THERE AND YOU JUST TURN AROUND AND YOU'RE SCARED OF THE HAIR
g-FfY0j50sk_4 0 YOU START ROLLING LIKE THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID AND YOU'RE WOBBLY
g-FfY0j50sk_5 0 YOU SEE HOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT WAVE IN THERE
g-FfY0j50sk_6 0 IT'S NOT GOING TO BE TIGHT
g-FfY0j50sk_7 0 IT'S GOING TO BE LOOSE
g-FfY0j50sk_8 0 WHEN YOU LET IT DOWN HER HAIR IS GOING TO BE FRIZZY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AS GOOD
g-FfY0j50sk_9 0 AGAIN MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE GRIPPING THE HAIR REALLY NICE AND TIGHT WITHOUT HURTING THE CLIENT OF COURSE
g-FfY0j50sk_10 0 GRIP IT TIGHT STRAIGHT DOWN
g-FfY0j50sk_11 0 YOU SEE HOW I WENT TO THE MIDDLE SECTION
g-FfY0j50sk_12 0 I'M SHOWING YOU THE MIDDLE CURL
g-FfY0j50sk_13 0 THIS ONE GOES THIS WAY
g-FfY0j50sk_14 0 GO STRAIGHT OUT
g-FfY0j50sk_15 0 IT DOESN'T GO UP ANYMORE
g-FfY0j50sk_16 0 I'M GOING UP LIKE THIS A LITTLE BIT BUT I'M STILL GOING TO END UP BEING REALLY CLOSE
g-FfY0j50sk_17 0 THAT'S REAL CLOSE
g-FfY0j50sk_18 0 YOU WANT THEM CLOSE LIKE THAT AND EVEN
g-FfY0j50sk_19 0 YOU SAW WHAT CAN HAPPEN IF YOU'RE NOT REALLY TIGHT AND IF YOU'RE TOO LOSE
g-FfY0j50sk_20 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE REALLY TIGHT
GI4J2qx7vzQ_1 0 THIS ARM POSITION WE CALL BUDDHA ARMS
GI4J2qx7vzQ_2 0 NOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHEN WE BELLY DANCE WE OFTEN WANT OUR HANDS AWAY FROM OUR BODY OPENING TO THE SPACE LETTING OUR AUDIENCE SEE OUR MOVES
GI4J2qx7vzQ_3 0 WE NEVER WANT OUR HANDS TO BE BLOCKING OUR OUR WHAT ARE BODY IS DOING
GI4J2qx7vzQ_4 0 BUT IN THIS POSITION WE ACTUALLY DO BRING THE HANDS IN FRONT OF THE BODY
GI4J2qx7vzQ_5 0 WE'RE GOING TO BRING THE PALMS TOGETHER ELBOWS OUT TO THE SIDES
GI4J2qx7vzQ_6 0 NOW IT'S IMPORTANT HERE NOT TO CLOSE IN DON'T CLOSE THE BODY IN KEEP THE ELBOWS LIFTED DON'T LET THE SHOULDERS COME UP KEEP THE SHOULDER BLADES DOWN
GI4J2qx7vzQ_7 0 AND THE PALMS PRESS IN THE FOREARM SHOULD BE PARALLEL WITH THE FLOOR
GI4J2qx7vzQ_8 0 NOW AS THE HANDS TOUCH DON'T CLOSE IN THE HANDS HERE
GI4J2qx7vzQ_10 0 YOU WANT TO KEEP THAT ENERGY PUSHING UP SO THE ENERGIES COMING UP FROM YOUR CENTER AND RISING UP
GI4J2qx7vzQ_11 0 SO THIS IS A GREAT POSITION TO USE WHEN YOU'RE JUST STARTING YOUR DANCE AS AN OPENING AND THEN MOVING INTO OTHER MOVEMENT
GI4J2qx7vzQ_12 0 YOU CAN ALSO CLOSE WITH THIS MOVEMENT
GI4J2qx7vzQ_13 0 IT'S A VERY NICE MEDITATIVE CLOSING
GI4J2qx7vzQ_14 0 YOU CAN ALSO DO A COUPLE MOVEMENTS HERE I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND ANY CHEST MOVEMENTS AGAIN BECAUSE YOU'RE BLOCKING YOUR BODY
GI4J2qx7vzQ_15 0 BUT FOR ANY HIP MOVEMENTS THAT IT DOES CREATE A NICE FRAME
H7urMitIlAE_1 0 AND YOU CAN SEE THE MORE THAT I MIX THIS THE DULLER IT'S GETTING
H7urMitIlAE_2 0 I MEAN IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS COMES FROM THAT WHICH IS SO MUCH BRIGHTER
H7urMitIlAE_3 0 BUT THAT'S THE THING YOU GOT TO REMEMBER
H7urMitIlAE_4 0 EVERY TIME YOU MIX TWO PIGMENTS TOGETHER YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE LOSE SOME PIGMENT STRENGTH
H7urMitIlAE_6 0 IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO BE AS BRIGHT A COLOR AS IT WAS
H7urMitIlAE_7 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO PUT THAT
H7urMitIlAE_9 0 IT'S LIKE IT'S GETTING A TERRIBLY DULL PINK
H7urMitIlAE_10 0 AND I AM GOING TO ADD IN LIKE COMING TO THE WHITE INSTEAD OF ADDING INTO THAT BECAUSE I DO THAT FOREVER IN A DAY AND JUST SEE IF I CAN GET A LIGHTER PINK
H7urMitIlAE_11 0 NOW OBVIOUSLY WITH THIS IT LOOKS LIKE WE COULD GET WE COULD GET LIGHTER EVEN THAN THAT
H7urMitIlAE_12 0 BUT THERE WE GO
H7urMitIlAE_13 0 SO YOU GOT THIS GRADATION OF PINKS
H7urMitIlAE_14 0 WE'RE GOING TO GO IN THE OTHER DIRECTION AND GET DARK
H7urMitIlAE_15 0 AND ALL YOU DO IS TAKE YOUR RED AND YOU START ADDING BLACK TO IT
H7urMitIlAE_16 0 AND BLACK CAN CHANGE THINGS REALLY REALLY FAST
H7urMitIlAE_17 0 AND IT DOES CERTAINLY DARKEN THE COLOR
H7urMitIlAE_18 0 I MEAN THE FIRST THING EVERYBODY DOES IS GO OH I GOT TO HAVE A DARK COLOR I'LL ADD BLACK
H7urMitIlAE_20 0 AGAIN ITS REALLY GOING TO AFFECT THE BRILLIANCE OF YOUR COLOR
H7urMitIlAE_21 0 DARK BLACK ESPECIALLY KIND OF DULLS COLORS
H7urMitIlAE_22 0 AFTER ALL IT'S USUALLY MADE FROM YOU KNOW A CARBON WHICH IS NOTHING MORE THAN A SOOT FROM YOUR CANDLE REALLY
H7urMitIlAE_23 0 AND SO IT'S LITERALLY YOU'RE DIRTYING YOUR PAINT
H7urMitIlAE_24 0 BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU GET DARKER AND DARKER AND DARKING AND HOW DARKER CAN YOU GET AND STILL SAY THAT IT'S RED
H7urMitIlAE_25 0 AND HERE'S THE LAST ONE I THINK
H7urMitIlAE_26 0 THIS IS DARK AS MUCH BLACK HAS I CAN GET IT AND STILL SAY THAT IT'S RED
HDTkpCbQrEw_1 0 WITH OUR YOUTH PROGRAMS THAT WE ACTUALLY OFFER WE ACTUALLY START IN KINDERGARTEN THROUGH COLLEGE
HDTkpCbQrEw_2 0 IN THE YOUNGER GRADES WE HAVE OUR THREE SCREEN ASSEMBLY SHOW THAT WE BRING IN TO THEIR SCHOOL AND THEIR ASSEMBLY HALL OR THEIR GYM SEVENTY FIVE FOOT WORTH OF SCREEN WHERE IT GIVES KIND OF AN IMAX EXPERIENCE
HDTkpCbQrEw_3 0 IT GOES THROUGH AND IT TALKS ABOUT THE ISSUES OR MAKING SMART CHOICES AS IT IMPACTS DEATHS AND UNDERAGE DRINKING AND ALL THOSE OTHER FACTORS AS WELL
HDTkpCbQrEw_4 0 WE'VE GOT A PROGRAM THAT'S CALLED PROTECTING YOU PROTECTING ME
HDTkpCbQrEw_5 0 THAT IS WHERE WE ACTUALLY TRAIN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO GO IN AND TO THEN THEY GO IN AND WORK WITH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS ABOUT SMART CHOICES WEARING THEIR HELMETS WEARING THEIR SEAT BELTS ALL KINDS OF OTHER FACTORS
HDTkpCbQrEw_6 0 IF THERE'S ANYTHING UP BEHIND THEIR HANDS IN A CAR VEHICLE PROJECTILES MAKE SURE THOSE THINGS ARE DOWN IN THE FLOORBOARD TO HELP MAKE THEM TO HAVE SMART CHOICES IN THE FUTURE AS WELL
HDTkpCbQrEw_7 0 ANOTHER ONE OF OUR PROGRAMS IS CALLED YOUTH IN ACTION
HDTkpCbQrEw_8 0 THAT'S A GREAT PROGRAM AND IT REALLY FOCUSES ON TEENAGERS FROM TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN SOMEWHERE IN THAT RANGE
HDTkpCbQrEw_9 0 AND WHAT THAT PROGRAM IS IS WE GO IN WE KIND OF START IT IN SCHOOLS OR A COMMUNITY SO MAYBE IT'S A CITY OF SCHOOLS SO IT'S NOT ONE SPECIFIC SCHOOL NECESSARILY
HDTkpCbQrEw_10 0 AND WHAT WE DO WITH THAT IS WE GO IN AND WE HAVE THE STUDENTS DO ALCOHOL FREE PROGRAMS
HDTkpCbQrEw_11 0 THEY GO IN AND THEY CAN HELP WITH THE PROM PROGRAMS AND DOING THE PLEDGE FORMS
HDTkpCbQrEw_12 0 THEY CAN ALSO WORK WITH ALCOHOL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THEIR OWN STATES TO WHERE THEY ACTUALLY ARE TRAINED TO GO IN AND DO THINGS LIKE ALCOHOL PURCHASE SURVEYS TO WHERE THEY'LL GO IN AND ACTUALLY GO TO A CONVENIENCE STORE AND TRY AND PURCHASE ALCOHOL AND THEN WE TRACK THOSE AND SAY LOOK THERE'S AN ISSUE HERE
HDTkpCbQrEw_13 0 THERE'S A PROBLEM HERE
HDTkpCbQrEw_14 0 SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS WE DO ARE SHOULDER TAPS TO WHERE WE'LL GO IN AND TRAIN THEM TO WHERE THEY'LL GO UP TO PEOPLE IN THE PARKING LOT OF MAYBE A GROCERY STORE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND TRY AND GET THEM TO PURCHASE ALCOHOL AS WELL
HDTkpCbQrEw_15 0 AND WE USE THAT AS A SURVEY AS WELL
HDTkpCbQrEw_16 0 SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT THEY DO WITH YOUTH IN ACTION IS STICKER SHOCK
HDTkpCbQrEw_17 0 SO WE'LL WORK WITH CONVENIENCE STORES AND OTHER SUPPLIERS TO WHERE WE'LL ACTUALLY PUT LITTLE STICKERS THAT SAYS JUST A LITTLE REMINDER SAYS DON'T PROVIDE ALCOHOL TO SOMEONE UNDER THE AGE OF 21
HDTkpCbQrEw_18 0 SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE PROGRAMS OUR PROM PROGRAM OUR HOMECOMING PROGRAMS ARE TITLED AS THINK PROGRAMS
HDTkpCbQrEw_19 0 WE'RE TRYING TO GET THEM TO THINK
HDTkpCbQrEw_20 0 WE'RE ACTUALLY EXPANDING INTO DOING A SPRING BREAK VERSION A GRADUATION VERSION
HDTkpCbQrEw_21 0 SOME OF THOSE KEY TIMES HOMECOMING SPRING BREAK ARE WHEN YOU'RE SEEING THE PEAKS OF DEATHS OF TEENAGERS
HDTkpCbQrEw_22 0 AND SO IF WE CAN GO IN AND MAKE AN IMPACT ON THEM AND MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON THEM IF WE JUST REACH ONE OF THEM THAT COULD GO UP AND HELP MAKE THAT DECISION WHEN THEY'RE SITTING THERE
HDTkpCbQrEw_23 0 THEY THINK ABOUT THE VICTIM'S STORY THAT THEY SAW ON ONE OF OUR PROGRAMS AND THEY THINK TWICE BEFORE GETTING BEHIND THE WHEEL WE'VE DONE OUR JOB AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH THAT
HDTkpCbQrEw_24 0 BOTH THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE FEW PROGRAMS WE'VE GOT
HDTkpCbQrEw_25 0 WE'VE GOT TONS AND TONS OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE DO
HDTkpCbQrEw_26 0 WE DO OUR TIE ONE ON FOR SAFETY PROGRAM THE RED RIBBON WEEK THAT WE DO TYPICALLY IS AROUND OCTOBER NOVEMBER AND WE'VE GOT A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM STUDENTS AS WELL
hbRsw9-dvpY_1 0 SO JUST AS BEFORE WHEN WE WERE LEARNING OCTAVES WE WERE LEARNING TO TUNE THE LOWER OCTAVE AND HIGHER OCTAVE AND EVEN AS YOU GO UP IN THE POSITIONS YOU CAN CONTINUE PRACTICING OCTAVES BUT WHAT IS BASICALLY CHANGING IS THAT AGAIN YOUR HAND IS JUST SHIFTING UPWARDS
hbRsw9-dvpY_2 0 SO YOU WILL FIND THAT YOUR FIRST AND FOURTH FINGER IN THE OCTAVE POSITION THEY ARE GOING TO BE THE SAME EXCEPT THAT YOUR WHOLE HAND IS JUST SHIFTED UP A WHOLE STEP SO FOR THE FIRST ONE WE ARE GOING TO LEARN THE B OCTAVE SO TO GET TO THE B SLIDE UP TO THE B FROM THE G STRING
hbRsw9-dvpY_3 0 YOU MIGHT HAVE TO ADJUST YOUR FOURTH FINGER JUST A LITTLE BIT DEPENDING ON HOW BIG YOUR HAND IS IF YOU HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A SMALLER HAND AGAIN YOU MIGHT HAVE TO FIND THAT YOU HAVE TO BRING YOUR ARM AROUND JUST SLIGHTLY TO HELP YOU REACH THE FOURTH FINGER BUT IF YOU HAVE MORE LONGER ARMS LIKE I DO IT WON'T BE REALLY NECESSARY FOR YOU TO BRING YOUR ARM AROUND LIKE THAT
hbRsw9-dvpY_4 0 IF YOU HAVE KIND OF A SMALLER HAND IT IS GOOD TO PRACTICE REACHING YOUR FOURTH FINGER AS WELL
HJY7r1E0hjU_1 0 HI I'M REBECCA GUENTHER WITH WWW.M5A1PHOTOGRAPHY.COM AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO BECOME A WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER
HJY7r1E0hjU_2 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO FOR THIS ONE IS YOU WANT TO GO OUT AND YOU WANT TO PULL TOGETHER A PORTFOLIO IDEALLY OF WEDDINGS
HJY7r1E0hjU_3 0 BUT IT'S ALSO OK IF MAYBE YOU STAGE THE WEDDINGS

HJY7r1E0hjU_6 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE THEM NOT FEEL TOO POSED IDEALLY BUT YOU ALSO WANT TO KNOW HOW TO GET AN ENTIRE GROUP OF PEOPLE TOGETHER AND HAVE THEM LOOK GOOD

HJY7r1E0hjU_9 0 HOPEFULLY THE WEDDING PLANNER WILL LIKE YOUR WORK ENOUGH THAT THEY WILL RECOMMEND YOU TO THE BRIDE AND THE GROOM
HJY7r1E0hjU_10 0 IT ALSO HELPS TO USE YOUR FRIENDS AS NETWORKING DURING THIS
HJY7r1E0hjU_11 0 SO IF YOU VOLUNTEER TO PHOTOGRAPH A WEDDING FOR FREE FOR ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT THEY'LL SHOW YOUR IMAGES TO THEIR FRIENDS AND THEN THEIR FRIENDS WILL USE YOU AND HIRE YOU ON
HJY7r1E0hjU_12 0 AND THAT'S HOW YOU BECOME A WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER
GrnggJJBZ4Y_1 0 OUR NEXT STEP IS TO ATTACH THE EYES
GrnggJJBZ4Y_2 0 HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT IS USING THE ADDITIONAL CLAY THAT WE HAD SET ASIDE
GrnggJJBZ4Y_3 0 AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO USE A VERY SMALL PIECE OF WIRE
GrnggJJBZ4Y_4 0 AND I'VE ALREADY CREATED THESE ALMOST LIKE EYELIDS FOR OUR FROG
GrnggJJBZ4Y_5 0 AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW IS GIVE HIM SOME ACTUAL EYES
GrnggJJBZ4Y_6 0 SO I'M GOING TO CUT THE WIRE REALLY CAREFULLY ABOUT THIS LENGTH
GrnggJJBZ4Y_7 0 IT DEPENDS ON HOW BIG THE BALL IS GOING TO BE THAT WE'RE USING FOR HIS EYE
GrnggJJBZ4Y_8 0 AND AS THIS CLAY STARTS TO DRY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT HAS ENOUGH MOISTURE AND NOT TOO MUCH
GrnggJJBZ4Y_9 0 BUT JUST ENOUGH
GrnggJJBZ4Y_10 0 AND WE'LL TRY OUT THE SIZE
GrnggJJBZ4Y_11 0 THIS SIZE MIGHT BE TOO BIG
GrnggJJBZ4Y_12 0 YEAH WE WANT TO TAKE IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT
GrnggJJBZ4Y_13 0 I'M GOING TO DIVIDE THAT JUST ABOUT IN HALF
GrnggJJBZ4Y_14 0 ROLL UP THAT BALL AGAIN
GrnggJJBZ4Y_15 0 AND WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING THE WIRE IN TO THE THICK PART
GrnggJJBZ4Y_16 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT DOWN INTO THE HEAD INSTEAD OF THROUGH THE BACK OF THE EYE
GrnggJJBZ4Y_17 0 AND YOU GO IN LIKE THIS
GrnggJJBZ4Y_18 0 AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS PIECE HERE AND PRESS IT ON
GrnggJJBZ4Y_19 0 THAT WAY OUR FROG EYE IS GOING TO STAY ON
GrnggJJBZ4Y_20 0 WE'RE GOING TO DO THE SAME THING WITH THE OTHER SIDE
gmKuw84O45g_1 0 YOU DON'T REALLY NEED INSULATION NOW
gmKuw84O45g_2 0 IT'S THE FALL IT'S NOT COLD IT'S NOT TOO HOT NOT A PROBLEM BUT IN THE WINTERTIME AND IN THE SUMMERTIME INSULATION IS A GREAT THING TO HAVE IN THE HOUSE
gmKuw84O45g_3 0 NOW I'M ROBERT MARKEY AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF INSULATION HOW TO BUY INSULATION FOR YOUR HOUSE
gmKuw84O45g_4 0 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF KINDS BUT BASICALLY YOUR CHOICES ARE IF YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IT IN YOURSELF I LIMIT IT TO THREE
gmKuw84O45g_5 0 THE FIRST THE OLD STYLE FIBERGLASS
gmKuw84O45g_6 0 THERE IT IS FIBERGLASS INSULATION
gmKuw84O45g_7 0 IT COMES IN A WIDTH AND IT COMES IN A DEPTH
gmKuw84O45g_8 0 THE WIDTH CAN BE 24 IF YOUR STUDS ARE 24 ON CENTER SIXTEEN IF THEY ARE SIXTEEN ON CENTER
gmKuw84O45g_9 0 THE DEPTH FOR YOUR WALLS USED TO BE TWO X FOUR SO IT'S THREE 1/2 INCH
gmKuw84O45g_10 0 IF THEY'RE NOW TWO X 6'S THEY ARE FIVE 1/2 INCHES
gmKuw84O45g_11 0 IF IT IS FOR A CEILING IT CAN BE UP TO I BELIEVE THEY HAVE TEN INCH FIBERGLASS NOW FOR YOUR CEILING
gmKuw84O45g_12 0 FIBERGLASS IS ITCHY WHEN YOU PUT IT IN
gmKuw84O45g_13 0 THE FOIL FACE RIGID IS A REALLY NICE ALTERNATIVE BECAUSE THE FOIL IS GOING TO REFLECT THE HEAT AND HERE'S YOUR INSULATION IN HERE
gmKuw84O45g_14 0 THIS COMES IN BASICALLY FOUR X EIGHT SHEETS AND WHEREVER YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IT BETWEEN THE STUDS OR IN THE CEILING YOU'RE GOING TO CUT IT TO WHATEVER WIDTH YOU NEED

G9GhnDfAvYE_1 0 SCOTT SOLLER HI MY NAME IS SCOTT SOLLER YOGA INSTRUCTOR HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
G9GhnDfAvYE_2 0 KUNDALINI YOGA IS THE YOGA OF AWARENESS AND WHAT WE DO IN THIS PRACTICE IS MAKE SURE TO TAKE A VERY MEDITATIVE APPROACH TO THE POSTURES AND RESTING BETWEEN THE POSES
G9GhnDfAvYE_3 0 SO IT'S THAT CULTIVATION OF AWARENESS THAT IS REALLY KEY TO OUR PRACTICE
G9GhnDfAvYE_4 0 SERPENT KUNDALINI IS SAID TO METAPHORICALLY RESIDE AT THE BASE OF THE SPINE COILED THREE AND A HALF TIMES AROUND THE ROOT CHAKRA
G9GhnDfAvYE_5 0 WHAT WE DO IS WE PROGRESSIVELY AWAKEN THAT SERPENT VERY GENTLY SO THAT IT RISES UP THROUGH THE CHAKRA SYSTEM PIERCING THE VEILS AND THE OBSCURATIONS TOWARD GREATER CONTEXTS AND ROLES AND MAKE SURE THAT IN THIS PRACTICE THAT YOU MODIFY THE POSES ACCORDINGLY THAT YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THE POSTURES

gig-b3-DKWY_3 0 SO WE WANT TO START THIS POSE JUST WITH YOUR FEET WIDER THAN YOUR HIPS
gig-b3-DKWY_4 0 WE'RE GOING TO PAUSE TO ANGLE YOUR TOES WIDE
gig-b3-DKWY_5 0 AND YOU'RE GOING TO DETERMINE JUST WHERE YOUR FEET IS STANDING
gig-b3-DKWY_6 0 WE'RE GOING TO LOOK FOR THE COMFORT OF YOUR BODY SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO RELEASE YOUR HIPS TOWARDS THE EARTH CREATING BALANCE IN BOTH FEET
gig-b3-DKWY_7 0 WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO INVITE THE PALMS TO YOUR HEART AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE EQUAL PRESSURE BETWEEN THE KNEES AND THE PALMS
gig-b3-DKWY_8 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON LENGTHENING THE SPINE LET THE SHOULDERS RELEASE DOWN FEEL THE SCAPULA FEELS THIS PHYSICAL MOVEMENT OF THE SCAPULA AS YOUR SHOULDER BLADES GLIDE DOWN THE SPINE

gxk4ThdlwB0_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO TELL YOU HOW TO HAVE YOUR DOG WAIT RATHER THAN COME TO YOU
gxk4ThdlwB0_2 0 SOMETIMES WHEN YOU HAVE A DOG ESPECIALLY A NEW ONE IN YOUR FAMILY HE MAY ASSOCIATE COMING TO YOU AS SOMETHING BAD HAPPENING TO HIM AND WHO HASN'T USED THAT WHEN THEY'RE MAD AT THEIR DOG OR WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO PUNISH THEM
gxk4ThdlwB0_3 0 SO WHAT WE MAY HAVE TO DO TO START THAT IS TEACH THE DOG TO JUST SIT AND WAIT UNTIL YOU GET TO THEM
gxk4ThdlwB0_4 0 SO IT'S GOING TO START WITH YOUR BASIC SIT AND THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR DOG WILL LEARN TO SIT AT A DISTANCE SO THIS IS AFTER YOU'VE PRACTICED THAT
gxk4ThdlwB0_5 0 THE FIRST THING YOU'RE GOING TO TEACH THE DOG AGAIN IS YOUR SIT
gxk4ThdlwB0_6 0 YOU'RE GOING TO DO YOUR DISTANCE SIT SO THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE FURTHER AWAY SIT THE DOG WILL STAY AND SIT WHEREVER HE IS
gxk4ThdlwB0_7 0 THEN YOU CAN COME TO THE DOG AND SAFELY GET THE DOG AND REWARD HIM
gxk4ThdlwB0_8 0 THE TRICK TO THIS WOULD BE TO LET HIM GO OFF AND PLAY AGAIN AFTERWARDS
gxk4ThdlwB0_9 0 IF YOU'RE ALWAYS HOOKING HIM UP TAKING HIM OFF TO LEAVE FOR THE DAY YOU'RE SIMPLY TEACHING THE DOG THAT IT'S NOT WORTH IT TO COME TO YOU OR TO WAIT FOR YOU
gxk4ThdlwB0_10 0 SO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE TREATING HIM FOR THOSE BEHAVIORS
GLGwxXx74u8_1 0 OKAY IN THIS SEGMENT WE HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF SERVES BUT WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER YOUR SERVES
GLGwxXx74u8_2 0 WELL THE MAIN POINT IN ALL OF YOUR SQUASH IS TO GET BACK TO THE TEE AREA RIGHT HERE SO WHEN I SERVE IF I SERVE AN OVER HEAD SERVE I WANT TO WATCH THE BALL AND I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE TEE
GLGwxXx74u8_3 0 IF I SERVE A LOB SERVE WHICH GIVES ME A LOT OF TIME I MOVE TO THE TEE SO ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT MOST PLAYERS HAVE IS WHEN THEY USE THEIR ARM AND SHOULDER TOO MUCH
GLGwxXx74u8_4 0 YOU SEE IF I USE MY ARM AND SHOULDER TOO MUCH IT FORCES ME OVER THIS WAY WHICH IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE DIRECTION THAT YOU SHOULDN'T WANT TO MOVE IT TO
GLGwxXx74u8_5 0 SO THE IDEA HERE IS TO USE YOUR HIP AND SHOULDER TURN SO IT FORCES YOU TO COME BACK TO THE TEE
GLGwxXx74u8_6 0 THE TEE IS WHERE YOU WANT TO BE
GLGwxXx74u8_7 0 WHEN YOU ARE AT THE TEE AND AT THE PROPER POSITION AT THE TEE YOU CAN COVER EVERY SHOT IN THE GAME OF SQUASH
GLGwxXx74u8_8 0 WATCH WHAT MY FEET DO AND I MOVE RIGHT OVER SO BEFORE THE BALL IS EVEN TO MY OPPONENT I AM BACK AT THE TEE
GLGwxXx74u8_9 0 WHETHER I SERVE BACKHANDED AND IF I SERVE A NICE SLOW BALL I CAN ALMOST WALK TO THE TEE AND IF I HIT IT A LITTLE HARDER I'VE GOT TO GET READY BUT GETTING TO THE TEE AFTER YOU HIT YOUR SERVE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU CAN DO
h3VsNk1fN94_1 0 HI I'M EMILY LAREW CONTINUING ON WITH OUR HIP HOP SERIES
h3VsNk1fN94_2 0 WE'RE ON THE SIXTH COUNT OF EIGHT COUNTS FIVE SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT AND WE HAVE A JUMP AND RUN

h3VsNk1fN94_13 0 REALLY TRAVEL BECAUSE THAT MAKES YOU LOOK BIGGER INSTEAD OF KEEPING EVERYTHING REALLY REALLY SMALL INSIDE YOUR BOX
h3VsNk1fN94_14 0 ONE MORE TIME
h3VsNk1fN94_15 0 THREE AND FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT
h3VsNk1fN94_17 0 THOSE WERE YOUR RUNS WITH YOUR POPS AND YOUR JUMPS
g5kjSrinDg0_1 0 YOU CAN GO YOU CAN GET A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR AMPLIFIER AND SOME TIMES YOU CAN GET A EIGHTY DOLLAR AMPLIFIER
g5kjSrinDg0_2 0 THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GETTING A NAME BRAND AND OFF-NAME BRAND
g5kjSrinDg0_3 0 FOR INSTANCE WE CAN GET AN AFTER MARKET AMPLIFIER LIKE THIS UNIT RIGHT HERE
g5kjSrinDg0_4 0 THIS UNIT RIGHT HERE IS AROUND 300 WATTS HOUR
g5kjSrinDg0_5 0 THIS SMALL AMPLIFIER RUN TWO WOOFERS THAT COULD BE TWELVE HUNDRED WATTS ALTOGETHER
g5kjSrinDg0_6 0 THEN AGAIN YOU CAN AN OFF-NAME BRAND AMPLIFIER THAT WE HAVE RIGHT HERE WHICH IT SAYS ON THE UNIT ACTUALLY IT SAYS THAT IT'S TWELVE HUNDRED WATTS
g5kjSrinDg0_7 0 BUT THAT'S NOT A NAME BRAND
g5kjSrinDg0_8 0 WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS IF YOU TRY TO RUN THE SAME TYPE OF WOOFERS YOU'LL BE RUNNING WITH THIS AMPLIFIER OR THAT AMPLIFIER THERE WILL BE A BIG DIFFERENCE VOLUME WISE SOUND WISE QUALITY WISE AND DISTORTION WISE
g5kjSrinDg0_9 0 SO YOU WANT TO CONSIDER DEPENDING ON WHAT KIND OF SPEAKERS YOU HAVE THAT'S THE TYPE OF AMPLIFIER YOU SHOULD BE GETTING
g5kjSrinDg0_10 0 YOU HAVE GOOD SPEAKERS GET A GOOD AMPLIFIER
g5kjSrinDg0_11 0 OTHERWISE YOU'LL BE WASTING YOUR MONEY
goKokG7A59I_1 0 SO OTHER STUFF YOU WILL NEED ARE GOGGLES
goKokG7A59I_2 0 GOGGLES COME IN TONS OF DIFFERENT STYLES NOW
goKokG7A59I_3 0 I'D SAY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING NOW IS WHAT LENS COLOR YOU CHOOSE AND IF YOU BUY A PAIR OF GOGGLES I WOULD SAY GET THREE DIFFERENT COLORS AT LEAST CLEAR IS THE BEST FOR NIGHT AND WHEN IT IS REALLY SNOWING HARD BECAUSE THERE IS NO LIGHT REALLY AT THOSE TIMES
goKokG7A59I_4 0 YOU CAN GET A MIRROR LENS
goKokG7A59I_5 0 I USUALLY GET ONE OF THOSE AND THAT IS FOR WHEN IT IS REALLY REALLY SUNNY OUT
goKokG7A59I_6 0 YOU ARE NOT SQUINTING YOUR EYES ALL DAY LIKE ME BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE MY GOGGLES RIGHT NOW AND YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO GET A MEDIUM LENS WHICH IS PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE AMBER OR ROSE AND THAT IS LIKE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE THERE FOR THOSE SUNNY DAYS WHERE YOU JUST WANT THE SUN TO STAY OUT OF YOUR EYES A LITTLE BIT AND NEXT I HAVE GOT SOME WAX HERE
goKokG7A59I_7 0 THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF WAX AND THIS IS A MELT ON WAX THAT YOU MELT ON YOUR BOARD WITH AN IRON BUT YOU CAN BUY RUB ON WAX AS WELL
goKokG7A59I_8 0 GLOVES ARE SOMETHING YOU ARE GOING TO NEED OBVIOUSLY
goKokG7A59I_9 0 THOSE AREN'T TOO TOO IMPORTANT
goKokG7A59I_10 0 YOU DON'T NEED TO GET SNOW BOARD SPECIFIC GLOVES BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND IT BECAUSE THEY DO LAST LONGER THAN REGULAR GLOVES AND THAT IS ABOUT IT
hA9iUP60YOQ_1 0 AND AT THIS POINT I'M JUST GOING TO DO THE SAME THING THAT I WAS DOING ON THE UPPER LIP ON THE LOWER LOWER LIP AREA AND ON THE CHIN TRYING TO REFINE IT A LITTLE BIT BETTER
hA9iUP60YOQ_2 0 ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE DEFINITION AS TO WHERE THOSE THINGS ARE
hA9iUP60YOQ_3 0 YOU CAN SEE NOW THAT IT'S KIND OF GENERIC AS WE'VE BEEN RUNNING HEAT
hA9iUP60YOQ_4 0 IT GETS PRETTY GENERIC AS TO WHAT THE SHAPE OF THAT LOWER LIP IS WE WANT TO REFINE THAT BY LEAVING THE UP THE LIP ITSELF ALONE AND CARVING TO THE LIP IN THAT AREA UNDER THE LIP
hA9iUP60YOQ_5 0 SO BY SHAVING HERE WE CAN ESTABLISH A HARD EDGE BETWEEN THOSE TWO SURFACES THAT WILL DEFINE THE SHAPE OF THE BOTTOM LIP
hA9iUP60YOQ_6 0 AND WE'RE CLEARLY GOING TO BE DONE BEFORE
hA9iUP60YOQ_7 0 NOW YOU NOTICE THAT WHAT WE'RE GOING WHAT WE'RE ULTIMATELY DOING IS WE'RE MAKING THAT CHIN THE BOTTOM PART OF THE CHIN STICK OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN WE MAY WANT TO BUT THAT'S O.K
hA9iUP60YOQ_8 0 WE'LL COME BACK IN AND REMOVE THE CHIN AS THE NEXT PART OF THIS
hA9iUP60YOQ_9 0 RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST CONCENTRATING ON GETTING THAT LOWER LIP DEFINED MORE CLEARLY
hA9iUP60YOQ_10 0 NOW YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT LOWER LIP IS MUCH MORE ACCURATE THAN IT WAS
hA9iUP60YOQ_11 0 AND THE EDGE OF THE LIP IS CLEARER
gyRlgBAT2Lc_1 0 NOW WE HAVE DETERMINED BY THE BY HAVING TAKING MEASUREMENTS BEFORE THAT THE THAT THE DEPTH OF THE NUT SLOTS ARE ARE ARE GOOD BECAUSE THE THE STRINGS ARE SITTING AT A DECENT HEIGHT ABOVE THE FRETS
gyRlgBAT2Lc_2 0 AND THAT WE HAVE NO BUZZES HERE ON THE FIRST FRET
gyRlgBAT2Lc_3 0 THAT MEASUREMENT JUST FOR YOUR OWN INTEREST IS AT ABOUT OH TWO HUNDREDTHS OF AN INCH ABOVE THIS FRET BOARD AND THAT NUMBER IS VARIABLE DEPENDING UPON THE HEIGHT OF THE FRETS THEMSELVES
gyRlgBAT2Lc_4 0 BUT IT WORKS ON THIS PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT IT'S A GOOD GOOD HEIGHT
gyRlgBAT2Lc_5 0 BUT WHAT WE DETERMINED WAS THAT THE THAT THE NUT ITSELF WAS TOO HIGH BECAUSE THE THE STRINGS ARE SITTING TOO DEEPLY INTO THAT NUT INTO THOSE NUT SLOTS AND THAT CAN CAUSE BINDING
gyRlgBAT2Lc_6 0 WHAT WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO DO IS HAVE THE NUT STRINGS SIT ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THE NUT SLOTS
gyRlgBAT2Lc_7 0 SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO TAKE DOWN SOME OF THE TOP OF THE NUT SO THAT THE STRINGS DON'T HAVE TO SIT SO TIGHTLY IN THOSE IN THOSE SLOTS
_hjL5FZ-3D8_1 0 NOW ONE REASON I LIKE USING TOY CAMERAS IS THAT I FEEL THAT IF I HAVE A PROFESSIONAL LARGE CAMERA AND I'M SHOOTING AN EVENT OR I'M GOING OUT DOING MY OWN PERSONAL WORK I THINK SOMETIMES SEEING THAT TYPE OF CAMERA IN YOUR FACE REALLY INTIMIDATES PEOPLE AND IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET A CANNED LOOK OR A LOOK WHERE SOMEONE IS REALLY TALKING TO YOU OR CONNECTING WITH YOU SOMETIMES THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT USING THIS LITTLE TINY CAMERA THAT SEEMS TO WORK ON A SOCIOLOGICAL LEVEL FOR ME AND IT'S SORT OF IMPORTANT AND THIS WAS A FRIEND WHO I WAS HAVING A HARD TIME PHOTOGRAPHING ONE DAY
_hjL5FZ-3D8_2 0 SHE WANTED SOME PICTURES FOR HER PARENTS AND SHE WANTED IT TO BE FUN BUT SHE WAS YOU KNOW SHE WAS NERVOUS AND ONCE I STARTED TAKING OUT THE TOY CAMERA SHE STARTS PLAYING AROUND
_hjL5FZ-3D8_3 0 SHE'S HAVING FUN
_hjL5FZ-3D8_4 0 AND I THINK THIS IMAGE IS JUST YOU KNOW NICE IMAGE
_hjL5FZ-3D8_5 0 WE'RE AT AN ABANDONED HOTEL AND ACTUALLY I THINK THE IMAGE WORKED WITH THE HOLGA RATHER WITH A PROFESSIONAL CAMERA
_hjL5FZ-3D8_6 0 THIS IS ANOTHER IMAGE THAT I WAS HAVING A HARD TIME PHOTOGRAPHING THIS WAS WITH SOME TWINS THAT I'D SEEN ON THE STREET AND YOU KNOW THEY REALLY WEREN'T BUYING MY STICK ABOUT TRUSTING ME AND I JUST WANTED TO PHOTOGRAPH THEM
_hjL5FZ-3D8_7 0 THEY THOUGHT I WAS AFTER SOMETHING BUT WHEN I TOOK OUT THE TOY CAMERA THEY STARTED LAUGHING AT IT AND I THINK THAT IMAGE JUST REALLY I GOT IT AND THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY I REALLY LIKE USING TOY CAMERAS
gRXyZt_fAJQ_1 0 HI MY NAME IS DR PAM NICHOLS
gRXyZt_fAJQ_2 0 I'M A VET AT THE ANIMAL CARE CENTER IN BOUNTIFUL UTAH
gRXyZt_fAJQ_3 0 JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT CARING FOR NEWBORN PUPPIES
gRXyZt_fAJQ_4 0 ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS AFTER YOUR DOG BEGINS TO DELIVER HER PUPPIES IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE PUPPIES STAY WARM AND STAY DRY
gRXyZt_fAJQ_5 0 AND SO MAKING SURE THAT THE BEDDING IS APPROPRIATE IS PROBABLY THE FIRST MOST IMPORTANT THING
gRXyZt_fAJQ_6 0 SO NO NEWSPAPER
gRXyZt_fAJQ_7 0 USE CLEAN TOWELS ABSORBENT TOWELS
gRXyZt_fAJQ_8 0 I FIND THAT EVEN SHEETS WILL GET TOO COLD WHEN THEY'RE WET
gRXyZt_fAJQ_9 0 SO ABSORBENT TOWELS IS A GOOD FIRST THING
gRXyZt_fAJQ_10 0 AND HAVE LOTS OF TOWELS AVAILABLE
gRXyZt_fAJQ_11 0 AND THEN AS THE PUPPIES ARE DELIVERED YOU CAN HELP THE MOM OUT EXCUSE ME BY DRYING THEM OFF AS YOU GO
gRXyZt_fAJQ_12 0 AFTER THE PUPPIES ARE BORN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR THE PUPPIES IS TO ENSURE THAT THEY GET ADEQUATE NUTRITION
gRXyZt_fAJQ_13 0 AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EACH PUPPY IS GETTING LATCHING ON TO THE MOM'S NIPPLE
gRXyZt_fAJQ_14 0 AND IF YOU CAN'T IF YOU'RE NOT SURE IF A PUPPY'S LATCHING ONTO THE MOM'S NIPPLE GO AHEAD AND PUT HIM ON
gRXyZt_fAJQ_15 0 POP THEIR LITTLE MOUTH OPEN USE YOUR FINGER TO POP THEIR MOUTH OPEN LIKE THAT AND STICK THEM ON A NIPPLE LET THEM SUCK AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE ACTUALLY SUCKLING
gRXyZt_fAJQ_16 0 ANOTHER THING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WITH NEWBORN PUPPIES IS GETTING ACCURATE WEIGHTS
gRXyZt_fAJQ_17 0 AND I LIKE FOR MY CLIENTS TO HAVE A LITTLE PAPER COLLAR THAT YOU PUT AROUND THE PUPPIES NECK WITH THEIR BIRTH WEIGHT ON IT AND THEN EVERY DAY AS YOU WEIGH THAT PUPPY YOU WRITE THE NEW WEIGHT ON THE COLLAR
gRXyZt_fAJQ_18 0 AS LONG AS THE PUPPIES ARE GOING UP IN WEIGHT THEN YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB
gRXyZt_fAJQ_19 0 IF THE PUPPIES ARE GOING DOWN IN WEIGHT YOU NEED TO SEE YOUR VETERINARIAN AND FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM MIGHT BE
gion2olf-gM_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS JINILEE REAVIS AND I'M A MESSAGE THERAPIST HERE AT VERONIKA'S COLOR AND SALON SPA AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gion2olf-gM_2 0 NOW ALSO WITH ARTHRITIS IF YOU HAVE THE PROBLEM WITH SWOLLEN UP IT IS FROM THE BACK UP FLUID THE FLUID IS BACKING UP IN THAT AREA IT IS NOT ABLE TO FLOW THROUGH PROPERLY AND ALSO IT IS THE LACK OF CIRCULATION
gion2olf-gM_3 0 SO MASSAGE THERAPY IS VERY VERY BENEFICIAL FOR THAT AND YOU JUST START WITH A LIGHT CIRCULAR MOVEMENT ALL AROUND THE FINGER AND THEN KNUCKLE AND THAT WOULD START GETTING THE BLOOD FLOW BACK
gion2olf-gM_4 0 YOU CAN DO LONG STRETCHES AS WELL
gion2olf-gM_5 0 I START WITH LIGHT PRESSURE FIRST TO JUST KIND OF GET THE CIRCULATION GET THE LIQUID BUILD UP MOVE DOWN AND ESPECIALLY WITH THIS WATER CAUSE YOU ARE MOVING TOXINS YOU ARE MOVING THE BUILD UP FLUID THAT CAUSE THE KNUCKLES THE SWOLLEN KNUCKLES AND GETTING THE CIRCULATION BACK
gion2olf-gM_6 0 SO BASICALLY ANY SITUATION THAT YOU HAVE MASSAGE THERAPY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WILL BE ABLE TO HELP YOU AND BENEFIT YOU TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON AND FEEL BETTER ABOUT YOURSELF AND WITH YOURSELF
gfEQrZdSmNA_1 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO LEARN ABOUT WEB SAFE COLORS BEFORE WE ADVANCE ANY FURTHER
gfEQrZdSmNA_2 0 AND THE THING WITH THE WEB SAFE COLORS IS THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN SET OF COLORS THAT ARE KIND OF GUARANTEED WITH ALL WEB BROWSERS
gfEQrZdSmNA_3 0 AND THESE ARE IN THE HEX DECIMAL SPECTRUM
gfEQrZdSmNA_4 0 AND SO WHEN YOU SEE THESE IT'LL BE A NUMBER SYMBOL FOLLOWED BY A SIX DIGIT CODE OF LETTERS AND NUMBERS MIXED TOGETHER
gfEQrZdSmNA_5 0 AND I THINK THE BEST WAY TO SHOW YOU THIS IS TO ACTUALLY GO INTO PHOTO SHOP BECAUSE THEY KIND OF HAVE A DISPLAY OF THESE COLORS THEMSELVES
gfEQrZdSmNA_6 0 AND SO IF I GO INTO MY COLOR PALLET AND I GO INTO MY COLOR LIBRARIES I CAN PICK A WEB COLOR I SHOULD BE ABLE TO PICK MAYBE NOT HERE LET'S GO OVER TO MY SWATCHES AND THEN HERE- HERE WE GO WEB SAFE COLORS
gfEQrZdSmNA_7 0 AND THEN IF WE LOOK DOWN HERE ARE ALL THE WEBSITE COLORS AND YOU CAN PICK THESE AND THEY'LL LOOK FAMILIAR BECAUSE THEY'RE USED ALL OVER THE PLACE
gfEQrZdSmNA_8 0 AND THEN WE CLICK HERE AND WE GO DOWN HERE AND THIS IS WHERE THEY TELL YOU WHERE THE ACTUAL CODE FOR THE NUMBER IS
gfEQrZdSmNA_9 0 AND A NUMBER CODE FOR A WEBSITE A HEXADECIMAL CODE WILL ALWAYS BE THE NUMBER SIGN FOLLOWED BY WHICHEVER LETTERS AND NUMBERS CREATE THAT COLOR
gfEQrZdSmNA_10 0 AND AS YOU MOVE IT AROUND YOU'LL SEE
gfEQrZdSmNA_11 0 AND IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE SIX DIGITS AND IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE NUMBERS AND- AND IT COULD BE ALL NUMBERS LIKE BLACK IS 0000 BUT WHITE ON THE OTHER HAND IS FFFFF F OR WHATEVER SIX F'S
gfEQrZdSmNA_12 0 SO THOSE ARE TWO REALLY EASY ONES THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS REMEMBER BLACK IS JUST 0'S AND WHITE IS JUST F'S
hC86qyizBoQ_1 0 MY NAME IS CHRISTINE MARQUETTE AND I'M A REGISTERED DIETITIAN WITH THE AUSTIN REGIONAL CLINIC AND I AM GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO LOSE WEIGHT ON THE APPLE CIDER VINEGAR DIET
hC86qyizBoQ_2 0 THIS IS ACTUALLY A MISNOMER
hC86qyizBoQ_3 0 IT IS NOT TRULY A DIET IN THE SENSE OF THE WORD
hC86qyizBoQ_4 0 MOST DIETS THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT OR READ ABOUT ARE VERY SPECIFIC MEAL PLANS THAT MAY INCLUDE MENUS SPECIFIC FOODS TO EAT
hC86qyizBoQ_5 0 WHAT THIS PREMISE IS ALL IT IS ASKING IS THAT YOU INCLUDE APPLE CIDER VINEGAR AT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR MEALS
hC86qyizBoQ_6 0 IT DOES NOT RESTRICT ANY FOODS IT DOESN'T RESTRICT ANY PORTION SIZES
hC86qyizBoQ_7 0 IT IS NOT ASKING YOU TO EAT ANY CERTAIN FOODS THE ONLY THING IT IS ASKING YOU TO DO IS ADD APPLE CIDER VINEGAR TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR MEALS
hC86qyizBoQ_8 0 THE PREMISE BEHIND IT IS THAT THE VINEGAR WILL ACTUALLY SPEED UP YOUR METABOLISM AND CAUSE YOU TO BURN OFF THE FOOD THAT YOU ARE EATING MUCH MORE RAPIDLY
hC86qyizBoQ_9 0 THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC DATA BEHIND THIS DIET
hC86qyizBoQ_10 0 THERE IS NO PROOF THAT THIS WILL ACTUALLY WORK
hC86qyizBoQ_11 0 THERE IS NO PROOF THAT IT WILL SPEED UP YOUR METABOLISM IN ANY WAY
hC86qyizBoQ_12 0 SO APPLE CIDER VINEGAR IN AND OF ITSELF IS NOT AN UNHEALTHY THING TO USE BUT IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT IS A MIRACLE WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENT
hC86qyizBoQ_13 0 IT IS NOT GOING TO CAUSE YOU TO LOSE A LOT OF WEIGHT
hC86qyizBoQ_14 0 IT CAN BE A HEALTHY ADDITION TO A MEAL FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A SALAD WITH A VINEGARETTE DRESSING AND THE VINEGARETTE PART OF IT IS APPLE CIDER VINEGAR
hC86qyizBoQ_15 0 IT IS PERFECTLY FINE TO USE THAT
hC86qyizBoQ_16 0 THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH APPLE CIDER VINEGAR BUT AGAIN IT IS NOT REALLY GOING TO MAKE YOU LOSE WEIGHT
hC86qyizBoQ_17 0 IT IS NOT GOING TO INCREASE YOUR METABOLISM
hC86qyizBoQ_18 0 SO THOSE ARE SOME THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND ABOUT THE APPLE CIDER VINEGAR DIET
gHpdEbTvkMY_1 0 WITH THIS CUMBIA STEP THIS SIDE STEP WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS STEP NOW AND ADD SOME VARIATIONS TO IT
gHpdEbTvkMY_2 0 HERE'S THE BASIC STEP
gHpdEbTvkMY_3 0 RIGHT TOGETHER RIGHT SLIDE LEFT TOGETHER LEFT SLIDE
gHpdEbTvkMY_4 0 THE FIRST VARIATION WE'RE GOING TO ADD ON TO THAT IS KIND OF A DOUBLE STEP
gHpdEbTvkMY_5 0 WE'RE GOING TO DO IT DOUBLE
gHpdEbTvkMY_6 0 TWICE INSTEAD OF ONCE
gHpdEbTvkMY_7 0 YOU'RE GOING TO GO ONE TWO THREE FOUR
gHpdEbTvkMY_8 0 LET ME DO THAT AGAIN
gHpdEbTvkMY_9 0 ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT
gHpdEbTvkMY_10 0 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A FULL EIGHT COUNT TO THE RIGHT AND A FULL EIGHT COUNT TO THE LEFT
gHpdEbTvkMY_12 0 IT GOES RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT SO IT'S THE DOUBLE
gHpdEbTvkMY_14 0 LET'S TAKE IT FROM A BASIC
gHpdEbTvkMY_15 0 YOU'RE GOING TO GO ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT
gHpdEbTvkMY_16 0 HERE'S THE DOUBLE
gHpdEbTvkMY_17 0 THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT
gHpdEbTvkMY_18 0 JUST TO BREAK IT DOWN ALL YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE STEPPING OUT DRAGGING THAT LEFT FOOT STEPPING AND DRAGGING
gHpdEbTvkMY_19 0 STEPPING DRAGGING IN
gHpdEbTvkMY_20 0 ON THE WAY BACK IT'S THE SAME THING STEPPING OUT AND DRAGGING
gHpdEbTvkMY_21 0 THAT IS THE DOUBLE STEP FOR CUMBIA
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_1 0 SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE DESIGNING STUFF YOU MIGHT THINK WOW IS THERE ROOM FOR INNOVATION HERE WHAT CAN I DO THAT'S DIFFERENT
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_2 0 IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT DON'T STRESS YOURSELF OUT TOO MUCH YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE INNOVATIVE ALL THE TIME
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_3 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE NEW THINGS JUST THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR AND IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE UNCREATIVE ONE DAY JUST DO WHAT I DO
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_4 0 I'LL TAKE A BASIC SILHOUETTE HERE I HAVE BOY BRIEFS BOY SHORTS
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_5 0 WHAT I DID WAS I DREW A DESIGN ON THEM AND THAT SYMBOLIZES DIFFERENT FABRICS THAT ARE COMBINED TO MAKE THAT
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_6 0 IT CAN BE YOUR COLLECTION CAN BE INTRINSICALLY YOU BY THE WAY YOU COMBINE FABRICS
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_7 0 IT CAN BE A SIMPLE SILHOUETTE BUT THE WAY YOU COMBINE THE FABRICS AND THE DRAWINGS AND THE GEOMETRIC LINES YOU MAKE ON THEM MAKES IT COMPLETELY YOUR OWN
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_8 0 THINK OF ABSTRACT ART THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING OF WHEN I DID THIS
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_9 0 I THOUGH UGH BOY SHORTS AGAIN
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_10 0 BUT I ADDED IN THE PANELS AND THEN A WAISTBAND AND IT CREATED SOMETHING THAT WAS COMPLETELY ME AND MY OWN
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_11 0 SO I DON'T REALLY THINK I NEED TO DRAW ANOTHER PAIR OF BOY SHORTS FOR YOU
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_12 0 BUT WE WILL JUST TO REVIEW IT
Hd1yfM-7KJ4_13 0 MAKE YOUR WAISTLINE DECIDE WHERE YOU WANT YOUR LEGS TO COME UP TO AND THEN LIKE I DID THE PANELS THEN I CREATED A WAISTBAND

GMW1RxM8NsA_2 0 MY NAME IS DARREN STORR AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I WANT TO SHOW YOU GUYS HOW TO RUN 800 METERS SUCCESSFULLY
GMW1RxM8NsA_3 0 AND LIKE I SAY THIS IS A STAGGERED RACE SO EACH RUNNER IS RUNNING BEHIND A PERSON AND THEY'RE RUNNING FOR A POSITION INTO THAT EVENT INTO THAT RACE
GMW1RxM8NsA_4 0 NORMALLY AROUND 600 METERS OR SO YOU WILL HAVE A RUNNER STARTING TO BREAK DOWN BECAUSE OF THAT LACTIC ACID I EXPLAINED AND THIS IS WHERE YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO RUN EFFICIENTLY AND SMART FOR 800-METER RUNNING
GMW1RxM8NsA_5 0 THE DIFFERENCE IS YOU HAVE TWO LAPS AND MOST RUNNERS LIKE I SAID THEY WOULD WANT TO RUN IN BETWEEN FIFTY AND 55 SECONDS EACH LAP
GMW1RxM8NsA_6 0 SO THIS IS MORE OF A TACTICS RACE BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE
gB4vedWyOa4_1 0 SO AFTER THAT DOUBLE JUMP WE NEED SOMETHING TO JUST KIND OF FILL IN THE RHYTHM THERE AND IT IS JUST A REAL FAST TEC TEC TEC TEC TEC SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO KIND OF SHUFFLE BACKWARDS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP OUR LEGS
gB4vedWyOa4_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO GO RIGHT LEFT AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE OF THOSE STRING PULLS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER SO THE RHYTHM IS JUST GOING TO GO ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE
gB4vedWyOa4_3 0 THERE'S A LITTLE PAUSE AND YOU STEP RIGHT LEFT AND A STRING PULL
gB4vedWyOa4_4 0 SO JUST REMEMBER AFTER THAT NINTH ONE YOU STEP LEFT AS A PREP STEP STEP BUT YOUR BIG STEPS ARE RIGHT AND LEFT AND THEN YOUR STRING PULL
gB4vedWyOa4_5 0 SO LET'S TRY THAT WITH THE DRUM
gB4vedWyOa4_6 0 WE'LL GIVE HIM A FOUR COUNT ON THE WAY IN AND WE'LL PRETEND THAT WE ALREADY DID THE DOUBLE JUMP AND THEN WE'LL SHUFFLE BACK AND ONE
gB4vedWyOa4_7 0 LET'S TRY THAT ONE MORE TIME WITH THE DRUMS
gB4vedWyOa4_8 0 GOOD SO YOU ARE JUST SHUFFLING YOUR ARMS ARE FOLLOWING YOUR FOOT MOTION JUST REMEMBER TO KIND OF SWIVEL YOUR HIPS ON THAT PART AND THEN A QUICK STRING PULL

GYZLMMECK5k_3 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE PROPER METHOD FOR BREAKING THE MECHANICAL WELD BETWEEN YOUR BALL JOINT AND YOUR SPINDLE
GYZLMMECK5k_4 0 THE WAY THIS IS DESIGNED AND I'LL SHOW YOU ON MY NEW BALL JOINT HERE IN A SECOND IS IT IS A CONCAVE HERE ON THIS SIDE AND A CONVEX ON THIS SIDE
GYZLMMECK5k_5 0 THEY ARE A TAPER REVERSE TAPER WHEN THEY SQUEEZE TOGETHER THEY ARE ACTUALLY DESIGNED TO HOLD TIGHT EVEN IF THE NUT BREAKS OFF
GYZLMMECK5k_6 0 HOW YOU BREAK THAT FITTING IS WITH THE TOOL HERE IT'S CALLED A PICKLE FORK
GYZLMMECK5k_7 0 YOUR GOING TO TAKE AND SLIP IT BETWEEN YOUR SPINDLE AND YOUR BALL JOINT AND HAMMER IT INTO POSITION

GYZLMMECK5k_10 0 AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S SKINNER AT THE TOP AND GETS FATTER AND FATTER AT THE BOTTOM
GYZLMMECK5k_11 0 AS THAT NUT TIGHTENS DOWN IT SQUEEZES THAT PROGRESSIVELY FATTER PORTION INTO A PROGRESSIVELY SMALLER HOLE WHICH GENERATES WHAT THEY CALL A MECHANICAL WELD
GYZLMMECK5k_12 0 I'M GOING TO TAKE MY PICKLE FORK AND SLIP IT BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM AND HAMMER IT INTO POSITION
GYZLMMECK5k_13 0 YOU'RE GOING TO HAMMER AWAY UNTIL THE WELD GIVES FREE
GYZLMMECK5k_14 0 IT MAY TAKE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF HAMMERING
GYZLMMECK5k_15 0 RIGHT THERE THE MECHANICAL WELD HAS BEEN BROKEN AS YOU CAN SEE OUR UPPER BALL JOINT IS NOW FREE AND WE'RE READY TO CONTINUE WITH THE REST OF THE DISASSEMBLING PROCEDURE
GYZLMMECK5k_16 0 THAT IS THE PROPER WAY TO SEAT YOUR PICKLE FORK AND BREAK THE MECHANICAL WELD BETWEEN THE SPINDLE AND THE BALL JOINT

GoaCw3u3g7k_5 0 NOW ACCORDING TO OUR DRAWING IT S GOING TO BE TEN INCHES LONG
GoaCw3u3g7k_6 0 SO WE'LL MAKE A MARK AT TEN INCHES WITH OUR TAPE MEASURE

hiZ6DKSaizA_1 0 IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING AN EXERCISE PROGRAM TO GET STRONGER ARMS I'VE GOT SOME GREAT TIPS FOR YOU
hiZ6DKSaizA_2 0 THIS IS ALICE MONSAERT AND THE FIRST EXERCISE WE ARE GOING TO DO IS A PUSH UP
hiZ6DKSaizA_3 0 A PUSH UP IS A GREAT EXERCISE BECAUSE IT NOT ONLY DEVELOPS ARM STRENGTH IN THE TRICEP PARTICULARLY THE TRICEP BUT ALSO THE CHEST AS WELL
hiZ6DKSaizA_4 0 WE CAN DO THEM IN A MODIFIED POSITION WHICH WOULD BE ON THE KNEES
hiZ6DKSaizA_5 0 THE HIPS ROLL FORWARD
hiZ6DKSaizA_6 0 THE SPINES STAYS IN NEUTRAL WHICH MEANS THE HEAD HAS TO STAY LIFTED
hiZ6DKSaizA_7 0 THE ELBOWS GO OUT TO THE SIDE AND YOU EXHALE AS YOU LIFT UP INHALE AS YOU GO DOWN EXHALE AS YOU LIFT UP
hiZ6DKSaizA_8 0 AVOID LEAVING THE GLUTS IN THE AIR OR SAGGING THROUGH THE LOW BACK
hiZ6DKSaizA_9 0 SO THAT IS ONE GREAT ARM EXERCISE TO INCORPORATE TO GET STRONGER ARMS
hiZ6DKSaizA_10 0 THE OTHERS ARE DONE WITH FREE WEIGHTS OR DUMB BELLS AND YOU CAN DO SIDE LATERAL RAISES SO STANDING WITH THE FEET HIP DISTANCE APART SOFTEN THE KNEES SHOULDERS BACK AND LIFT YOUR ARMS TO THE SIDE
hiZ6DKSaizA_11 0 YOU CAN ALSO DO THAT IN AN OVERHEAD PRESS AGAIN FOR THE SHOULDERS
hiZ6DKSaizA_12 0 YOU CAN CHANGE A RANGE OF MOTION TO GO TO THE SIDE AND YOU CAN ALSO INCORPORATE SOME BICEP CURLS AND TRICEP PRESSES
hiZ6DKSaizA_13 0 ALL OF THESE EXERCISES ARE GOING TO GET YOUR ARMS STRONGER BUT MY ADVICE IS SEEK THE ADVICE OF A PERSONAL TRAINER AND THEY CAN HELP DEVELOP A PROGRAM BASED ON YOUR INITIAL FITNESS LEVEL AND YOUR GOALS
hiZ6DKSaizA_14 0 THIS IS ALICE MONSAERT AND YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY
H5rPVr2yZ6M_1 0 OKAY IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO BE INSTALLING SEATBELT FASTENERS
H5rPVr2yZ6M_2 0 BASICALLY WHAT IT IS IS THEY'RE HELD IN WITH A TEN MILLIMETER BOLT WITH A SEVENTEEN MILLIMETER HEAD AND THEY HAVE A WASHER ON THEM A LOCK WASHER AND THEN A SPACER BUSHING
H5rPVr2yZ6M_3 0 THE SPACER BUSHING GOES ON BETWEEN THE ACTUAL BELT AND THE CAR ITSELF
H5rPVr2yZ6M_4 0 AND THAT ALLOWS THE SEATBELT TO MOVE ON THE FEMALE END THE FEMALE LATCH SIDE
H5rPVr2yZ6M_5 0 AND IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT YOU PUT THESE IN CORRECTLY AND TIGHTEN THEM DOWN CORRECTLY BECAUSE YOUR LIVES DEPEND ON THEM
H5rPVr2yZ6M_6 0 THEY NEED TO BE IN THERE AND FASTENED CORRECTLY
H5rPVr2yZ6M_7 0 SO THAT'S THE INSIDE ONE OR THE FEMALE LATCH
H5rPVr2yZ6M_8 0 THIS IS THE MALE PORTION HERE AND IT COMES UP AND CONNECT TO A RATCHET MECHANISM ONE HALF CONNECTS ON THE OUTSIDE
H5rPVr2yZ6M_9 0 IT SHOULD HAVE THE BOLT ITSELF A THICK SPACER A BIG FLAT METAL WASHER ANOTHER THREE INCH WIDE SPACER AND THEN THESE USUALLY HAVE A RETAINING CLIP ON THEM TO HOLD THEM ALL TOGETHER
H5rPVr2yZ6M_10 0 JUST START IT WITH YOUR FINGERS BY HAND
H5rPVr2yZ6M_11 0 MAKE SURE IT THREADS CORRECT
H5rPVr2yZ6M_12 0 AND I'M JUST GOING TO USE A DRIVER TO RUN THEM DOWN
H5rPVr2yZ6M_13 0 AND THEN I GOT A HALF INCH RATCHET TO TIGHTEN THEM
H5rPVr2yZ6M_14 0 OKAY GOOD AND TIGHT
H5rPVr2yZ6M_15 0 WE'VE GOT GOOD FREE MOVEMENT FOR THE SPACERS
H5rPVr2yZ6M_16 0 WE'LL JUST DO THE SAME THING ON THE INSIDE
H5rPVr2yZ6M_17 0 HOLD THE UNIT IN PLACE
H5rPVr2yZ6M_18 0 MAKE SURE IT'S SET UP CORRECTLY
H5rPVr2yZ6M_19 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR RELIEF BUTTON IS TO THE OUTSIDE
H5rPVr2yZ6M_20 0 ONCE AGAIN I'LL START WITH MY FINGER
H5rPVr2yZ6M_21 0 I'M JUST GOING TO RUN IT DOWN WITH THE GUN AND THEN TIGHTEN IT WITH A HALF INCH RATCHET
H5rPVr2yZ6M_22 0 NOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET AS MUCH MOVEMENT OUT OF THESE
H5rPVr2yZ6M_23 0 THEN SLIDE THE BOOT DOWN AND COVER UP THE BOLT ASSEMBLY
H5rPVr2yZ6M_24 0 AND THEN WE JUST MOVE TO THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR AND GET THE INSIDE ONE AND THE OUTSIDE ONE IN THE SAME PROCEDURE
H5rPVr2yZ6M_25 0 MAKE SURE YOU TIGHTEN THEM DOWN CORRECTLY
H5rPVr2yZ6M_26 0 ONCE YOU GET THE SEATBELT LATCHES IN AND YOU'RE CERTAIN THEY'RE DONE CORRECTLY AND YOU'VE GOT THEM TIGHT PLEASE WATCH OUR NEXT SEGMENT
H5rPVr2yZ6M_27 0 WE'LL COVER INSTALLING THE REAR SEAT
_Gkvdc7Yw4U_1 0 BRIAN MONTGOMERY OKAY
_Gkvdc7Yw4U_2 0 SO WE GOT THE TRACK IS DONE VOCALS BASS AND GUITAR AND HAVE SENT IT TO THE CD SO WE GOT A HARD COPY OF IT
_Gkvdc7Yw4U_3 0 AFTER THAT YOU WANT TO RECORD ANOTHER TRACK IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE YOU KINDA GO BACK THROUGH THE ORIGINAL PROCESS BUT THIS TIME WE DON'T RESET THE ZERO YET
_Gkvdc7Yw4U_4 0 WHAT I GENERALLY DO IS AGAIN FROM THERE JUST HIT PLAY FROM WHEREVER YOU CUT IT OFF AT THE END OF THE LAST TRACK GIVE IT A GOOD FIVE TO TEN SECONDS HIT STOP THEN WE CAN ZERO IT OUT AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE YOU'RE IN A DIFFERENT POINT IN THE TAPE BUT YOU CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND START RECORDING ANOTHER SONG

hG9RF62szyc_1 0 IN THIS VIDEO I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THROWING THE CRYSTAL STICK UNDERNEATH YOUR LEG
hG9RF62szyc_2 0 NOW THERE ARE REALLY TWO COMMON WAYS OF DOING THIS
hG9RF62szyc_3 0 THE FIRST WAY IS JUST USING THE NORMAL TICK TOCK AND PUSHING THE CRYSTAL STICK FROM YOUR FROM THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR LEG UNDER THREW THE CENTER
hG9RF62szyc_4 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE TICK TOCK GOING WE'RE GOING TO KICK OUR LEG UP PUSH THE CRYSTAL STICK UNDERNEATH AND BRING IT BACK OUT OVER THE TOP
hG9RF62szyc_5 0 IT'LL LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS
hG9RF62szyc_6 0 WATCH AGAIN JUST BRING IT OUT AND DO A TICK TOCK UNDERNEATH MY LEG AS I'M KICKING OVER THE TOP
hG9RF62szyc_7 0 THIS IS PRETTY EASY
hG9RF62szyc_8 0 IT SHOULDN'T TAKE YOU TOO LONG TO LEARN
hG9RF62szyc_9 0 YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT BOTH LEGS BOTH HANDS INTERCHANGEABLY
hG9RF62szyc_10 0 THE SECOND WAY IS A LITTLE BIT HARDER BUT LOOKS SIGNIFICANTLY COOLER
hG9RF62szyc_11 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE FULL SPIN WITH OUR RIGHT STICK LIKE THIS BUT AT THE END OF IT WE'RE GOING TO KICK OUR LEG OVER THE TOP AND THROW UP IN THE MIDDLE
hG9RF62szyc_12 0 SOMETHING LIKE THAT
hG9RF62szyc_13 0 SO IF YOU WATCH IT AGAIN I'M DOING A FULL SPIN WITH MY RIGHT CONTROL STICK KICKING MY RIGHT LEG OVER IT AT THE SAME TIME THEN I'M TOSSING IT UP THE MIDDLE AND CATCHING AGAIN
hG9RF62szyc_14 0 SOMETHING LIKE THAT
hG9RF62szyc_15 0 THE TIMING WILL TAKE A LITTLE BIT TO GET USED TO BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO KICK YOU LEG OVER RIGHT UP THAT'S A FAILURE
hG9RF62szyc_16 0 SEE IF WE CAN TRY THIS AGAIN
hG9RF62szyc_17 0 THE TIMING TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF GETTING USED TO BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO KICK YOUR LEG OVER THE STICK EXACTLY WHEN IT'S SPINNING LIKE THAT
hG9RF62szyc_18 0 AGAIN YOU CAN JUST PRACTICE FOR A LITTLE BIT
hG9RF62szyc_19 0 MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR SINGLE SPIN LIKE THIS DOWN PRETTY CLEAN AND JUST PRACTICE IT GET USED TO IT DO IT FROM BOTH SIDES AND THEN YOU CAN START ADDING IT TO YOUR REPERTOIRE OF TRICKS
GhpwZ2MiQxQ_1 0 LET'S NOW GO OVER THE SIXTEENTH NOTE RESTS
GhpwZ2MiQxQ_2 0 SO THE NOTATION VALUE LOOKS LIKE THIS
GhpwZ2MiQxQ_3 0 THERE IS JUST ONE MORE FLAG ON IT THAN THE EIGHTH NOTE ONE SO THERE IS TWO FLAGS ON THE SIXTEENTH NOTE RESTS
GhpwZ2MiQxQ_4 0 SO THE VALUE OF THAT IS HALF AS MUCH AS THE EIGHTH NOTE SO THIS IS WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE WITH THREE MORE SIXTEENTH NOTES AFTER THAT
GhpwZ2MiQxQ_5 0 SO IT WOULD BE REST E AND UH
GhpwZ2MiQxQ_6 0 NOW THE COUNTING OF SIXTEENTH NOTES ARE ONE E AND UH ONE E AND UH
GhpwZ2MiQxQ_7 0 SO I'M GOING TO JUST PLAY THAT LITTLE FIGURE AND REST ON THE ONE OF THE FIRST SIXTEENTH NOTES SO IT IS ONE TWO SO WE HAVE GOT CORD NOTES ON THE BASS SO IT IS ONE E AND UH ONE E AND UH TWO E AND UH THREE E AND UH FOUR E AND UH ONE E AND UH TWO E AND UH THREE E AND UH FOUR E AND UH
GhpwZ2MiQxQ_8 0 SO BASICALLY YOU ARE JUST DROPPING OUT THE FIRST QUARTER NOTE
GhpwZ2MiQxQ_9 0 IF YOU WANT TO THINK OF IT THIS WAY YOU'RE DROPPING OUT THE FIRST QUARTER NOTE AND THEN JUST ADDING E AND UH ON THE LAST THREE BEATS
GUGpTrCMn70_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M NICOLE AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT IGUANAS
GUGpTrCMn70_2 0 ONE PROBLEM IN FEMALE IGUANAS IN CAPTIVITY IS THAT THEY HAVE A TENDENCY TO BECOME EGG BOUND
GUGpTrCMn70_3 0 NOW A FEMALE IGUANA WILL OVULATE AND LAY EGGS WHETHER OR NOT A MALE IS AROUND
GUGpTrCMn70_4 0 EVEN IF THE EGGS ARE NOT FERTILE THEY WILL STILL LAY EGGS
GUGpTrCMn70_5 0 THE MAIN PROBLEM IN FEMALE IGUANAS WOULD BE THE EGG BOUND WHICH IS WHERE THEY CAN'T LAY THE EGGS
GUGpTrCMn70_6 0 USUALLY CAUSED BY AN IMPROPER HOUSING PROBLEM
GUGpTrCMn70_7 0 NOW FEMALE IGUANAS NEED TO HAVE A GOOD ARE TO LAY EGGS IF THEY NEED TO
GUGpTrCMn70_8 0 MAYBE A CAT PAN SIZED AREA
GUGpTrCMn70_9 0 EVEN A CAT PAN WILL WORK GREAT IF YOU JUST FILL IT WITH SOME SOIL OR VERMICULITE
GUGpTrCMn70_10 0 THIS WILL PROVIDE A WONDERFUL AREA FOR YOUR IGUANA TO LAY EGGS AND DEFINITELY RELIEVE HER FROM THE STRESS OF BEING EGG BOUND
GUGpTrCMn70_11 0 FEMALE IGUANAS THAT ARE NOT KEPT WITH A MALE DEFINITELY TEND TO BE MUCH MORE PRONE TO BEING EGG BOUND
GUGpTrCMn70_12 0 SOMETIMES MALE IGUANAS DO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR PROLAPSING PENISES
GUGpTrCMn70_13 0 THIS WILL APPEAR AS A LARGE PINK BLOB BASICALLY COMING OUT OF THE COLICOL AREA UNDERNEATH THE IGUANA
GUGpTrCMn70_14 0 THIS IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE TREATED BY A VETERINARIAN
GUGpTrCMn70_15 0 MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A VETERINARIAN LINED UP BECAUSE WHEN THIS DOES HAPPEN IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO THE IGUANA
GUGpTrCMn70_16 0 IF LEFT UNTREATED IT CAN CAUSE DEATH INFECTION VERY PAINFUL AND IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING YOU WOULD WANT TO THE VET IMMEDIATELY
GyujcYMIqV0_1 0 WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT ADVANCED FORWARD STROKE NOW FOR KAYAKING
GyujcYMIqV0_2 0 IN THE EARLIER LESSON IN BEGINNING FORWARD STROKE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT JUST USING YOUR ARMS PULLING AND PUSHING THE PADDLE WITH YOUR ARMS
GyujcYMIqV0_3 0 NOW IF YOU'RE KAYAKING YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO ROTATE YOUR BODY INSTEAD OF USING YOUR ARMS
GyujcYMIqV0_4 0 MY TORSO THE MUSCLES ARE A LOT LARGER AND STRONGER THAN IN MY ARMS SO I WANT TO USE MY TORSO MUSCLES THE CENTER CORE MUSCLES IN MY BODY TO PROPEL MY KAYAK DOWN THE RIVER
GyujcYMIqV0_5 0 SO FIRST THING IF I PUT THE KAYAK BLADE ON TOP OF MY HEAD AND I JUST ROTATE LIKE THIS SEE HOW I'M ACTUALLY USING MY STOMACH MUSCLES TO BRING THE BLADE BACK AND FORTH
GyujcYMIqV0_6 0 KIND OF LIKE THE ENERGIZER BUNNY YOU'RE JUST ROTATING LIKE THIS
GyujcYMIqV0_7 0 SO LET ME SHOW YOU ON THE GROUND WHAT THAT WILL DO
GyujcYMIqV0_8 0 SO I GO AHEAD AND SIT DOWN IN MY KAYAK LIKE I'M SITTING IN A BOAT AGAIN MY KNEES ARE SLIGHTLY BENT
GyujcYMIqV0_9 0 WHAT I WANT TO DO INSTEAD OF JUST PULLING AND PUSHING WITH MY ARMS WHEN I REACH FORWARD SEE HOW MY WHOLE BODY ROTATES FORWARD LIKE THIS
GyujcYMIqV0_10 0 I'M GOING TO PLANT THE KAYAK PADDLE IN THE WATER AND THEN I WANT TO ROTATE MY ENTIRE BODY BACK LIKE THIS
GyujcYMIqV0_11 0 I LIFT OUT AGAIN I PLANT FRONT BLADE IN THE WATER AND I M GOING TO ROTATE MY ENTIRE BODY BACK
GyujcYMIqV0_12 0 SEE HOW I'M USING MY STOMACH MUSCLES TO PADDLE RATHER THAN MY ARMS
GyujcYMIqV0_13 0 SO ONE OF THE WAYS YOU CAN DO THAT IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE TRICKS THE END OF THE PADDLE THAT'S IN THE WATER IS CALLED THE BUSINESS END OF THE PADDLE
GyujcYMIqV0_14 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO PLANT THAT END OF THE PADDLE IN THE WATER I'M GOING TO LOCK MY NECK AND MY HEAD ON MY SHOULDERS SO WHEN MY NECK MOVES TO WATCH THAT PADDLE BLADE MY WHOLE BODY'S GOING TO MOVE
GyujcYMIqV0_15 0 SO SEE HOW I'M LOCKED
GyujcYMIqV0_16 0 I ROTATE LIKE THIS
GyujcYMIqV0_17 0 SEE HOW I'M LOOKING BACK AT THAT PADDLE THE WHOLE TIME AND IT FORCES MY BODY TO ROTATE
GyujcYMIqV0_18 0 SAME THING HERE
GyujcYMIqV0_19 0 I'M GOING TO PLANT THE BUSINESS END OF THE PADDLE IN THE WATER I'M GOING TO ROTATE BACKWARDS AND WATCH THAT PADDLE BLADE
GyujcYMIqV0_20 0 AGAIN THAT FORCES MY BODY TO ROTATE WITH THE PADDLE
GyujcYMIqV0_21 0 AND THAT WAY I'M USING THE CORE MUSCLES IN MY BODY TO DO THE PADDLING
GyujcYMIqV0_22 0 THIS WAY IF I DO TWENTY MILES AND I GET DONE MY STOMACH MUSCLES SHOULD HURT BUT MY ARM MUSCLES WILL BE FINE
GyujcYMIqV0_23 0 OKAY FOR THE ADVANCED FORWARD STROKE WHAT I WANT TO DO IS ROTATE MY BODY
GyujcYMIqV0_24 0 SO FULL ROTATION AS YOU CAN TELL I'M WATCHING THE BLADE
GyujcYMIqV0_25 0 SEE HOW MY BODY IS ROTATING AND MAKING THE BOAT GO FORWARD
GyujcYMIqV0_26 0 LOOKING FORWARD MY WHOLE BODY'S ROTATING AND MY CORE MUSCLES ARE DOING THE STROKE AND GIVING THE BOAT POWER
hgG8AZSEUKk_1 0 THE POTATOES ARE CUT SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND WORK ON OUR FRESH HERBS
hgG8AZSEUKk_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE CUTTING ROSEMARY AND THYME
hgG8AZSEUKk_3 0 NOW THERE'S A COUPLE OF WAYS TO GET THIS THYME OFF
hgG8AZSEUKk_4 0 YOU CAN PULL DOWN LIKE THIS AND DISCARD THE STEMS OR IF YOU HAVE A VERY SHARP KNIFE YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND JUST DICE THE WHOLE THING AND IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE FRESH HERBS YOU CAN STILL JUST USE DRIED FOR THIS AND GO AHEAD AND DICE UP THE STEMS SO NO ONE CHEWS ON THEM AND AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO COOK THESE SO THEY WILL BREAK DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE
hgG8AZSEUKk_5 0 WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND CUT OUR ROSEMARY AND AGAIN YOU CAN PICK OFF THESE PARTS LIKE THAT
hgG8AZSEUKk_6 0 YOU CAN DICE THE WHOLE THING OR YOU CAN JUST STRIP DOWN LIKE THIS
hgG8AZSEUKk_7 0 WHEN YOU GET CLOSE TO THE TOP IT WILL BREAK OFF WHEN YOU TRY AND DO THAT
hgG8AZSEUKk_8 0 DISCARD THE STEM AND THEN WE WILL DICE THIS FINE JUST LIKE WE DID WITH THE THYME
Hg5daULcRZE_1 0 WHENEVER WE HAVE A COMPLETED HAIRSTYLE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO BRAIDING YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO WRAP THE HAIR ONCE YOU RE DONE AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP IT MORE THAN ONE DAY YOU NEED TO WRAP IT OVERNIGHT
Hg5daULcRZE_2 0 WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A SILK SCARF THAT IS WOVEN AND WE HAVE A COTTON SCARF THAT IS WOVEN
Hg5daULcRZE_3 0 THIS PARTICULAR STYLE OF SCARF IS REALLY LONG AND IT STRETCHES OUT QUITE A WAYS WHICH IS NEAT IF YOU WANT TO WRAP IT AROUND THE HEAD MULTIPLE TIMES IF YOU'VE GOT SOME SORT OF MOISTURIZER YOU'RE WORKING WITH TO REALLY SATURATE AND HOLD EVERYTHING IN
Hg5daULcRZE_4 0 I LIKE THE SILK BECAUSE IT'S SMOOTH AND IT WON'T CAUSE ANY FRICTION BETWEEN YOUR HAIR AND THE SCARF
Hg5daULcRZE_5 0 NOW WITH THE COTTON BLEND I LIKE COTTON ONES BECAUSE THEY REALLY HOLD STUFF IN THERE
Hg5daULcRZE_6 0 IT DOESN'T I MEAN PATTERNS AND DYES REALLY DON'T MATTER PRETTY MUCH ANY FABRIC IS SAFE AS LONG AS YOU WASH IT BEFORE YOU USE IT AND THE COTTON WITH THE WOVE IS VERY STRONG SO IT WILL LAST A VERY LONG TIME AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANY ABUSE IF YOU NEED TO ADD A BOBBY PIN OR ANY TYPE OF CLIP IN AROUND OR UNDERNEATH IT
Hg5daULcRZE_7 0 SO THAT'S WHY I LIKE THE COTTON ONES BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST REALLY PRETTY FAILSAFE
Hg5daULcRZE_8 0 YOU CAN USE THEM ALL THE TIME
Hg5daULcRZE_9 0 YOU CAN WRAP THEM AROUND THE HEAD BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE COTTON SCARF YOU REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE IT STAYS VERY TIGHT BECAUSE IF IT GETS TOO LOOSE IT WILL WORK AGAINST YOU AND JUST BE REALLY LOOSE AND RUBBING AGAINST YOUR BRAIDS CAUSING THEM TO FRIZZ UP AND COME APART A LOT FASTER

G68Be5D5BrA_1 0 HELLO I'M GREG KOENIG OWNER OF FITNESS FOR LIFE
G68Be5D5BrA_2 0 AND TODAY WE ARE HERE TO DISCUSS WEIGHT TRAINING FOR WOMAN
G68Be5D5BrA_3 0 ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS FOR WEIGHT TRAINING FOR WOMAN IS TO FIGHT DISEASES SUCH AS OSTEOPOROSIS AND OSTEOARTHRITIS WHICH ARE VERY COMMON IN WOMAN THE OLDER THEY GET THE MORE PRONE THEY ARE TO IT
G68Be5D5BrA_4 0 ONE OF THE MOVEMENTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO DEMONSTRATE TODAY IS A LARGER MOVEMENT COMPOUND MOVEMENT THAT INVOLVES A LOT OF JOINTS AND MUSCLES
G68Be5D5BrA_5 0 AND SARAH'S GOING TO DEMONSTRATE THE MOVEMENT NOW
G68Be5D5BrA_7 0 SARAH WE'RE GOING TO START OFF WITH A SOFT KNEE
G68Be5D5BrA_8 0 AND YOU'RE GOING TO SLOWLY EXHALE KEEPING YOUR HEAD BACK AND YOU'RE GOING TO BED PRIMARILY AT THE WAIST TAKING THE WEIGHT DOWN TOWARDS YOUR SHINS
G68Be5D5BrA_9 0 NICE AND SLOW PAUSE AND WE'LL CONTINUE ALL THE WAY UP AT THE TOP
G68Be5D5BrA_10 0 AND THEN WE'LL CLEAR THE HIPS AT THE TOP TO GIVE THE BACK THE LOWER BACK A BREAK
G68Be5D5BrA_11 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO PERFORM TWO MORE REPETITIONS
G68Be5D5BrA_12 0 SLOW PAUSE BACK UP
G68Be5D5BrA_13 0 TWO PARTS TO THE MOVEMENT
G68Be5D5BrA_14 0 THE CONCENTRIC IS ON THE WAY DOWN
G68Be5D5BrA_15 0 NICE AND CONTROLLED AND THE CONCENTRIC IS A LITTLE FASTER ON THE WAY UP PAUSE THERE
G68Be5D5BrA_17 0 PRIMARILY WORKING ALL THE MUSCLES AND THE JOINTS
G68Be5D5BrA_18 0 THAT'S A BIG MULTI JOINT MULTI MUSCLE MOVEMENT
G68Be5D5BrA_19 0 THIS IS GREG AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR DEMONSTRATION OF WEIGHT TRAINING FOR WOMAN
g6vQ_WYVSk0_1 0 OKAY TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT KEEPING YOUR GOATS HEALTHY IN REFERENCE TO INTESTINAL PARASITES
g6vQ_WYVSk0_2 0 NOW IT'S NOT A REAL PLEASANT TOPIC BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE IF YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP GOATS
g6vQ_WYVSk0_3 0 GOATS DO GET WORMS
g6vQ_WYVSk0_4 0 IN FACT THEY ALL HAVE THEM
g6vQ_WYVSk0_5 0 IT'S NOT A MATTER OF ELIMINATING THE WORMS SO MUCH AS IT IS TO MANAGE THE LOAD
g6vQ_WYVSk0_6 0 SOME PEOPLE DO THEIR OWN HOME FECAL TESTS WITH A MICROSCOPE AND EXAMINE THE FECES FOR WORM LARVA TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH HOW MUCH LOAD THEY HAVE
g6vQ_WYVSk0_7 0 HOWEVER IF YOU'RE AROUND YOUR GOATS AND IF YOU WATCH THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS YOU CAN GENERALLY TELL
g6vQ_WYVSk0_8 0 SOME OF THE SIGNS OF PARASITES ARE THAT THEY GET A WHITENING OF THE GUMS AND THE WHITES OF THE EYES AND THEY START TO LOOK ANEMIC AND THEY MIGHT ACT SICK
g6vQ_WYVSk0_9 0 YOU MIGHT SEE DIARRHEA OR OTHER SIGNS THAT THEY'RE JUST NOT QUITE RIGHT
g6vQ_WYVSk0_10 0 THE MAIN PREVENTION FOR WORMS IS TO ROTATE YOUR PASTURES BECAUSE THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE WORM IS SUCH THAT THE LARVA THEY COME OUT IN THE STOOL
g6vQ_WYVSk0_11 0 THE LARVA HATCH OUT THE EGGS HATCH OUT AND THEY GROW
g6vQ_WYVSk0_12 0 THEY CLIMB UP ONTO THE WEEDS AND GRASS AND THEN THE GOATS RE-INGEST THEM AND END UP GETTING INFECTED
g6vQ_WYVSk0_13 0 THERE'S SEVERAL WAYS IF YOU HAVE A SERIOUS WORM PROBLEM THAT YOU CAN TREAT THEM WITH WHETHER WITH INJECTABLE MEDICINE OR A PASTE THAT'S GIVEN TO THEM ORALLY
g6vQ_WYVSk0_14 0 AND YOU MIGHT CHOOSE A TIME TO DO THAT RIGHT BEFORE THEY GO ON PASTURE OR RIGHT AFTER THE FROST
g6vQ_WYVSk0_15 0 ALSO IF YOU'VE TREATED YOUR WORMS WITH WORM MEDICINE YOU CAN'T DRINK THE MILK OR EAT THE MEAT FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DAYS
g6vQ_WYVSk0_16 0 SO IT MIGHT BE WISE TO WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE DRIED OFF OR LATE IN PREGNANCY TO DO THE WORMING
GopxbPCg7fw_1 0 OKAY NOW I'VE BEEN CARVING ON THIS GUY FOR SEVERAL HOURS NOW AND YOU MAY ASK YOURSELF WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED OR WHEN OR IT MAY NOT COME OUT LIKE THIS
GopxbPCg7fw_2 0 PROBABLY NOT GOING TO COME OUT LIKE THIS THE THE FIRST TIME YOU DO IT OR THE SECOND OR THE THIRD
GopxbPCg7fw_3 0 IS IT IMPORTANT
GopxbPCg7fw_5 0 THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO PRACTICE AND TO JUST ENJOY THE PROCESS OF CREATING SOMETHING ON YOUR OWN
GopxbPCg7fw_6 0 IF IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING THAT PICASSO DREW NO ONE CAN CRITICIZE PICASSO'S DRAWINGS SAME THING WITH YOUR SCULPTURES
GopxbPCg7fw_7 0 YES SOME OF THEM ARE NOT GOING TO LOOK PERFECT IT'S O.K
GopxbPCg7fw_8 0 IT'S THE PROCESS THAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH IS REALLY TRAINING YOUR EYE HOW TO SEE AND YOUR HANDS HOW TO PLAY YOURSELF HOW TO HAVE FUN IF YOUR NOT HAVING FUN FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO
GopxbPCg7fw_9 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A GREAT ARTIST ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS ENJOY THE PROCESS OF BEING CREATIVE AND USE YOUR CREATIVITY IN A WAY THAT GIVE YOU SOME REWARDS AND IF YOU END UP SOMETHING THAT LOOKS GOOD WONDERFUL IF YOU END WITH SOMETHING THAT'S WONDERFUL YOU STILL LEARN SOMETHING YOU STILL HAD FUN YOU STILL GOT TO EXPRESS YOUR CREATIVITY AND YOU CAN ALWAYS DO ANOTHER ONE AND EVENTUALLY THEY'LL GET BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER
GopxbPCg7fw_10 0 AND SOMEDAY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO ONE OF THESE AND HAVE IT TURN OUT AS GOOD AS THIS EVEN THOUGH THIS IS STILL CRUDE I'LL SPEND ANOTHER SIX HOURS WORKING ON THIS BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO THE CLIENT
GopxbPCg7fw_11 0 SO ENJOY THE PROCESS
H8EsisYoi_0_1 0 OK ONCE YOU'VE CREATED A FOUNDATION OF GREENERY FOR YOUR TULIPS NEXT THING YOU WANT TO DO IS CUT YOUR TULIPS
H8EsisYoi_0_2 0 YOU CAN GET A SIMPLE BUNCH OF TULIPS LIKE THIS AT THE FLOWER SHOP
H8EsisYoi_0_3 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AGAIN IS REMOVE ANY LOWER FOLIAGE THAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE WATER AND CUT YOUR STEMS BEFORE YOU PUT THEM IN
H8EsisYoi_0_4 0 ONCE YOU CUT THE STEMS YOU IMMEDIATELY INSERT THEM IN THE VASE
H8EsisYoi_0_5 0 AGAIN REMOVE THE LEAVES CUT THE STEM BUT THEM IN THE VASE
H8EsisYoi_0_6 0 AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GO AROUND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR TULIPS AREN'T TOUCHING EACH OTHER
H8EsisYoi_0_7 0 AND YOU'RE GOING TO SLIP THEM THROUGH THE GREENERY LIKE THAT
H8EsisYoi_0_8 0 REMOVE ANY BROKEN LEAVES OR LEAVES THAT ARE DOWN IN THE WATER BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO DECREASE THE LIFE OF THE TULIPS
H8EsisYoi_0_9 0 SO AGAIN YOU'RE GOING TO CUT THEM ARRANGE THEM AND JUST GO AROUND
H8EsisYoi_0_10 0 AND JUST KEEP GOING AROUND LIKE THAT UNTIL YOU HAVE A PRETTY DISPLAY OF TULIPS
H8EsisYoi_0_11 0 TULIPS ARE YOU KNOW THEY LIKE COLD WATER SO YOU JUST WANT TO KEEP THEM HAPPY AND THEY'LL KEEP YOU HAPPY
H8EsisYoi_0_12 0 SO YOU JUST KEEP GOING LIKE THAT AGAIN KEEPING THEM OFF OF EACH OTHER
H8EsisYoi_0_13 0 AND THEN THAT'S IT
H8EsisYoi_0_15 0 THERE'S YOUR FINISHED PRODUCT
H8EsisYoi_0_16 0 AND JUST FINISH IT OFF HOWEVER YOU LIKE

GD5Z7PWW8tQ_1 0 THIS IS JULIO ANTA FROM ANTA'S FITNESS & SELF DEFENSE MIAMI FLORIDA BRINGING YOU SOME CLASSES ON CHILDREN'S FUNCTIONAL TRAINING ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GD5Z7PWW8tQ_2 0 ONE OF THE MOST FUNCTIONAL THINGS YOU CAN DO IS CLIMBING A ROPE
GD5Z7PWW8tQ_3 0 YOU CAN GET THIS ROPE CHEAP AT ANY TYPE OF HARDWARE STORE
GD5Z7PWW8tQ_4 0 MAKE KNOTS AND HAVE THE CHILD CLIMB IT
GD5Z7PWW8tQ_5 0 YOU CAN PUT IT IN YOUR BACKYARD
GD5Z7PWW8tQ_6 0 I'VE SEEN PEOPLE INSIDE OF THEIR HOME DOING THIS
GD5Z7PWW8tQ_7 0 I LEARNED TO CLIMB A ROPE IN THE MILITARY AS AN ADULT IN THE MARINE CORP BUT CHILDREN CAN LEARN SO QUICK
GD5Z7PWW8tQ_8 0 GO SHOW THEM HOW TO CLIMB A ROPE WITHOUT YOUR FEET FIRST
GD5Z7PWW8tQ_10 0 THIS IS THE HARDER WAY
GD5Z7PWW8tQ_11 0 HE'S NOT USING HIS LEGS TO CLIMB THE ROPE
GD5Z7PWW8tQ_12 0 OKAY COME DOWN
GD5Z7PWW8tQ_13 0 NOW I WANT YOU TO CLIMB THE ROPE QUICKLY USING THE KNOTS AND USING YOUR LEGS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DEMONSTRATE IT
GD5Z7PWW8tQ_15 0 HE'S GOING TO BE USING HIS LEGS AND HIS ARMS SIMULTANEOUSLY TO CLIMB THE ROPE
GD5Z7PWW8tQ_16 0 HE TOUCHES THE ROOF AND SLOWLY COMES DOWN
GD5Z7PWW8tQ_17 0 HE WAS USING HIS LEGS AND HIS ARMS AT THE SAME TIME
GMc6AUPAWjc_1 0 NOW WE HAVE THE EYELINER ON THE TOP
GMc6AUPAWjc_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT FROM THE RESIDUE OF THE BRUSH AND JUST GO ALONG THE BOTTOM JUST A TINY BIT TO GIVE A NICE EVEN FEEL
GMc6AUPAWjc_3 0 YOU WANT IT MORE SMOKEY RATHER THAN JUST A FINE LINE SO REALLY SMUDGE IT IN SO IT GIVES MORE OF A SMOKEY LOOK RATHER THAN A FINE EYELINER LOOK
GMc6AUPAWjc_4 0 THEN I WANT TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF A HIGHLIGHT IN THE CORNER OF THE EYE SO I'M GOING TO TAKE THE SAME COLOR THE SHIMMERY COLOR THAT I USED AS A BASE AND I'M GOING TO PUT THAT RIGHT IN THE CORNER OF HER EYE
GMc6AUPAWjc_5 0 LOOK UP FOR ME
GMc6AUPAWjc_6 0 THAT'S GOING TO GIVE A NICE SHIMMERY HIGHLIGHT TO THE INSIDE CORNER
GMc6AUPAWjc_7 0 IT KIND OF SPUNKS UP THE LOOK BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF A NATURAL MAKEUP LINE
GMc6AUPAWjc_8 0 SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED A LITTLE SOMETHING WITH A OOMPH TO MAKE THE LOOK A LITTLE MORE SPUNKY
GMc6AUPAWjc_9 0 YOU CAN ALSO TAKE THAT SHIMMERY COLOR AT THIS POINT SINCE THE EYES ARE ALMOST DONE AND TAKE IT A LITTLE BIT UNDER THE BROW JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE OF A SPARKLE
GMc6AUPAWjc_10 0 JUST RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE BROW
GMc6AUPAWjc_11 0 IT JUST GIVES A LITTLE BIT OF A SHIMMER ALSO UNDERNEATH THE BROW JUST TO FUNK UP THE LOOK A LITTLE BIT
GMc6AUPAWjc_13 0 WE'RE PRETTY MUCH DONE WITH SHADOWS SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON
g-VDa76uTYQ_1 0 HI I'M KARINA FRALEY FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LITTLE LEAGUE
g-VDa76uTYQ_2 0 ONCE YOU'VE ENROLLED YOUR CHILD AND HAVE DETERMINED WHERE YOUR CHILD IS GOING TO PLAY YOU REALLY NEED TO SIT YOUR CHILD DOWN AND EXPLAIN TO THEM THE HISTORY OF LITTLE LEAGUE AND THE MISSION STATEMENT THAT IT REALLY IS TO ENCOURAGE SPORTSMANSHIP AND A SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND TO CREATE REALLY GREAT AND POSITIVE MEMORIES
g-VDa76uTYQ_3 0 WHEN THEY GO OUT ON THAT FIELD THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO WEAR THEIR UNIFORM PROUDLY AND THEY'RE GOING TO WANT REALLY DO RIGHT BY THE HISTORY OF THE LITTLE LEAGUE
g-VDa76uTYQ_4 0 YOU WANT TO TEACH THEM THAT THEY'RE NOT TO CAUSE FIGHTS OR CALL NAMES OR MAKE FUN OF ANY OTHER PLAYER OR ANY OTHER TEAM
g-VDa76uTYQ_5 0 THEY HAVE TO BE GRACIOUS WINNERS AS WELL AS GRACIOUS LOSERS
g-VDa76uTYQ_6 0 LITTLE LEAGUE COULD BE A LOT OF FUN BUT AS EVERYTHING ELSE YOU HAVE TO TEACH YOUR CHILD JUST SOME BASIC GUIDELINES AND RULES SO THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN BECOME COMPETITIVE DOESN'T BECOME A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE FOR THEM
H0QQv5UrmNQ_2 0 IT IS TRUE THAT DOGS ARE DERIVATIVE FROM GRAY WOLVES AND ARE PACK ANIMALS
H0QQv5UrmNQ_3 0 IN MY OPINION DOGS NEED FOUR TO TEN PLAYMATES NOT FORTY
H0QQv5UrmNQ_4 0 OFTENTIMES CUSTOMERS CALL ME AND WILL TRY TO TALK TO ME FOR AN HOUR OF WHY THEY THINK EVERY DOG SHOULD BE TAKEN TO A DOG PARK
H0QQv5UrmNQ_5 0 I POLITELY LET THEM KNOW THAT FROM MY EXPERIENCE AND THE REASON I STARTED MY COMPANY WAS BECAUSE I WITNESSED TIME AND TIME AGAIN UNHEALTHY UNTRAINED DOGS IN DOG PARKS
H0QQv5UrmNQ_6 0 I ALSO FIND THAT FOR CLEANLINESS AND HEALTH DOG PARKS MORE TIMES THAN NOT ARE NOT KEPT UP TO A CLEANLINESS STANDARD THAT I UPHOLD WITH MY PETS
H0QQv5UrmNQ_7 0 EVEN IF YOUR DOG HAS HAD SHOTS AND IS HEALTHY THERE'S A CHANCE AT A DOG PARK THEY COULD PICK UP A DISEASE OR GET IN AN ALTERCATION WITH A DOG RESULTING IN A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE THAT COULD EFFECT THE TRAINING AND ALL THE TIME YOU'VE PUT INTO YOUR DOG
H0QQv5UrmNQ_8 0 SO MY OPINION IF YOU GO TO A DOG PARK BE VERY AWARE WHAT OTHER DOGS ARE THERE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE THERE AND KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THE DOG INTERACTION TO MAKE SURE IT'S A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE
H0QQv5UrmNQ_9 0 MY RECOMMENDATION LIKE I SAID IS HAVING FRIENDS AND FAMILY WITH JUST THREE TO FIVE DOGS THAT YOUR DOGS CAN HAVE PLAY DATES WITH WEEKLY TO STILL GET THEM PROPERLY SOCIALIZED
GGeWQ-jLUFc_1 0 IN THIS CLIP I'LL EXPLAIN WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO CONVERT YOUR OLD VHS TAPES TO DVD
GGeWQ-jLUFc_2 0 WELL FOR STARTERS OBVIOUSLY YOU'LL NEED YOUR OLD VHS TAPES
GGeWQ-jLUFc_3 0 I HAVE A BUNCH OF THEM TIED RIGHT HERE
GGeWQ-jLUFc_4 0 ALSO OBVIOUSLY YOU'LL ALSO NEED A BUNCH OF DVDS
GGeWQ-jLUFc_5 0 SO THAT'S HERE
GGeWQ-jLUFc_6 0 THEN THE OTHER OBVIOUS ONES NEEDS ARE THE VCR USED TO PLAY YOUR VHS TAPES AND YOUR COMPUTER USED TO CAPTURE THEM ALONG WITH THE RIGHT SOFTWARE
GGeWQ-jLUFc_7 0 IF YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY SOFTWARE EDITING SOFTWARE CAPTURING OR DVD AUTHORING SOFTWARE YOU CAN USUALLY GET SOME FOR FREE
GGeWQ-jLUFc_8 0 THERE'S SOME ONE SPECIFICALLY THAT IS BUNDLED WITH WINDOWS AND MACINTOSH SYSTEMS
GGeWQ-jLUFc_9 0 SO YOU CAN GET THOSE FOR EDITING AND FOR DVD AUTHORING
GGeWQ-jLUFc_10 0 YOU CAN DOWNLOAD TRIAL VERSIONS WHICH ARE USUALLY FULLY FUNCTIONAL TRIAL VERSIONS FOR THIRTY DAYS FROM THE WEBSITE
GGeWQ-jLUFc_11 0 SO YOU JUST HAVE TO SEARCH AROUND AND FIND ONE OF THOSE
GGeWQ-jLUFc_12 0 ALSO THEY ARE ALL PRETTY SIMILAR SO YOU CAN JUST KIND OF TAKE YOUR PICK AND CHOOSE ONE
GGeWQ-jLUFc_13 0 THEN YOU ARE ALSO GOING TO NEED A WAY TO CONVERT THE FOOTAGE FROM YOUR VCR TO YOUR COMPUTER AND DIGITIZE IT
GGeWQ-jLUFc_14 0 THERE'S TWO OPTIONS
GGeWQ-jLUFc_15 0 ONE INVOLVES USING A CAMCORDER AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE OF THOSE YOU MIGHT HAVE AN ANALOG CAPTURE CARD
GGeWQ-jLUFc_16 0 HOWEVER IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE CARD OR IF YOU DON'T HAVE EITHER OF THEM BUYING THE CARD IS PROBABLY THE CHEAPER OPTION
GGeWQ-jLUFc_17 0 YOU PROBABLY CAN PICK ONE UP FOR ABOUT TWENTY DOLLARS
GGeWQ-jLUFc_18 0 SO IT IS NOT TOO EXPENSIVE
GGeWQ-jLUFc_19 0 OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO BORROW A CAMCORDER FROM SOMEONE THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY ARE PRETTY COMMON NOW
GGeWQ-jLUFc_20 0 SO THOSE ARE THE BASIC THINGS THAT YOU'LL NEED
GGeWQ-jLUFc_21 0 OH AND THE CABLES OF COURSE WHICH SHOULD COME WITH THE CAMERA
GGeWQ-jLUFc_22 0 YOU JUST HAVE YOUR FIRE WIRE WHICH IS THIS LONG GUY RIGHT HERE
GGeWQ-jLUFc_23 0 THEN YOU HAVE YOUR COMPOSITE VIDEO AND AUDIO CABLES USED TO CONNECT THE VCR TO THE ANALOG CAPTURE CARD
GGeWQ-jLUFc_24 0 THAT IS WHAT YOU'LL NEED TO CONVERT YOUR FOOTAGE FROM VHS TO DVD
HcXTE9nwihA_1 0 THE NEXT THING THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS YOUR PROPER LIGHTING AND HEATING FOR A CRESTED GECKO
HcXTE9nwihA_2 0 CRESTED GECKOS ARE A TROPICAL SPECIES THEY DON'T NEED AS MUCH HEATING AS SAY A DESERT SPECIES DOES BUT A LITTLE BIT OF HEATING MIGHT STILL BE NECESSARY DEPENDING ON YOUR HOME
HcXTE9nwihA_3 0 YOU NEED TO KEEP THE GECKO ANYWHERE BETWEEN SEVENTY TWO TO SEVENTY-FIVE DEGREES TEMPERATURE
HcXTE9nwihA_4 0 YOU CAN GO A LITTLE BIT HIGHER BUT DON'T GO TOO MUCH MORE THAN EIGHTY-FIVE AT ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION
HcXTE9nwihA_5 0 OFTEN CASE A SIMPLE HEAT FIXTURE JUST LIKE THIS A LAMP WITH A CERAMIC TOP ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A CERAMIC TOP AND A TWENTY-FIVE OR A FIFTY WATT BULB USUALLY SEVENTY-FIVE TOPS WILL DO YOU AS FAR AS HEATING GOES
HcXTE9nwihA_6 0 AGAIN YOU'RE NOT GOING AND LOOKING FOR ANY SUPER HIGH TEMPERATURES YOU JUST WANT TO KEEP THE CAGE AT A CONSTANT SLIGHTLY WARM TEMPERATURE JUST ABOVE WHAT YOU PROBABLY KEEP YOUR HOUSE AT
HcXTE9nwihA_7 0 THE OTHER THING YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT ALSO IS THE UVB LIGHT
HcXTE9nwihA_8 0 UVB COMES FROM FLORESCENT FIXTURES EITHER A COMPACT OR THE GOOD OLD TUBE FIXTURE AND WHAT THAT DOES IS THE UVB GIVES THE ANIMAL UVB LIGHT WHICH HE NEEDS TO CREATE VITAMIN D THREE IN HIS BODY AND MOVE CALCIUM INTO THE BONE STRUCTURE
HcXTE9nwihA_9 0 IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THING TO HAVE ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG ANIMALS AS THEY'RE GROWING AND THEY NEED ALL THE CALCIUM THEY CAN GET
HcXTE9nwihA_10 0 THIS WILL PROBABLY IT'S NOT GOING TO PUT OFF A LOT OF HEAT BUT IF YOU'RE KEEPING YOUR HOUSE IN THE SEVENTY-TWO DEGREE AREA ALREADY ONE OF THESE IS PROBABLY ENOUGH TO KEEP YOUR CRESTED GECKO NICE AND HAPPY
HcXTE9nwihA_11 0 WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN A CRESTED GECKO'S CAGE IS NOT NECESSARILY HIGH HEATS BUT YOU DO WANT A HIGH HUMIDITY
HcXTE9nwihA_12 0 YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO KEEP THE HUMIDITY UP AND THE HEAT TO AROUND SEVENTY TO SEVENTY-FIVE DEGREES
GV8RcNRQUVI_1 0 HI THIS IS KAREN FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
GV8RcNRQUVI_2 0 NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A FROG POP UP CARD
GV8RcNRQUVI_3 0 FOR THIS YOU WOULD NEED A CARD STOCK OR JUST A HEAVY PAPER YOU CAN USE
GV8RcNRQUVI_4 0 A PAIR OF SCISSORS SOME ACCENTS PENS AND A LITTLE BIT OF DOUBLE STICK TAPE OR A DAB OF GLUE
GV8RcNRQUVI_5 0 THIS IS GOING TO BE A QUARTER FOLD CARD
GV8RcNRQUVI_6 0 SO WE WOULD START BY MATCHING OUR CORNERS EXACTLY AND YOU WANT TO HOLD THOSE CORNERS EXACTLY TOGETHER
GV8RcNRQUVI_7 0 HOLD THAT AND THEN CREASE THE CENTER
GV8RcNRQUVI_8 0 PUT THE CREASE IN THE CENTER AND THEN TURN IN AND REPEAT OVER TO THE SIDE
GV8RcNRQUVI_9 0 HOLD THE CORNERS TOGETHER HOLD FIRMLY AND THEN CREASE THE CARD LIKE THIS
GV8RcNRQUVI_10 0 NOW WE ARE GOING TO OPEN IT UP AND FOLD IT THE LONG WAY LIKE THAT
GV8RcNRQUVI_11 0 SO FIRST YOU CAN MAKE THE MOUTH OF THE FROG
GV8RcNRQUVI_12 0 WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A CUT ABOUT A INCH AND A HALF IN
GV8RcNRQUVI_13 0 YOU CAN MEASURE IF YOU LIKE OR YOU CAN JUST GUESS
GV8RcNRQUVI_14 0 IT IS NOT PARTICULARLY YOU BE EXACTLY A INCH AND A HALF
GV8RcNRQUVI_15 0 YOU CAN MAKE YOUR FROG ANY SIZE YOU WANT
GV8RcNRQUVI_16 0 THEN YOU ARE GOING TO FOLD BACK THE CORNER OPEN THAT OUT
GV8RcNRQUVI_18 0 FOLD OUT THE OTHER SIDE LIKE SO AND CREASE THAT WELL
GV8RcNRQUVI_19 0 SO NOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS
GV8RcNRQUVI_20 0 WE ARE GOING TO MAKE ONE MORE CUT THIS IS FOR THE EYE AND YOU WILL CUT ON TOP
GV8RcNRQUVI_22 0 YOU ARE GOING TO CUT IN ABOUT A HALF A INCH RIGHT FROM THE MIDDLE OF THAT FOLDED AREA HEADED IT TOWARDS THE CORNER OF THE FOLD
GV8RcNRQUVI_23 0 THEN YOU JUST SNIP LIKE THAT
GV8RcNRQUVI_24 0 THEN WE ARE GOING TO FOLD THAT BACK
GV8RcNRQUVI_25 0 JUST LIKE WE DID WITH THE OTHER ONE BUT IT IS A LOT SMALLER
GV8RcNRQUVI_26 0 THIS IS WHAT IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE
gmXwsuHe1Zo_2 0 MY NAME IS SCOTT AND I'M THE OWNER OF CLIMB ON
gmXwsuHe1Zo_3 0 INDOOR ROCK CLIMBING GYM IN WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA
gmXwsuHe1Zo_4 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS ROCK CLIMBING 101
gmXwsuHe1Zo_5 0 ROCK CLIMBING IS INHERENTLY DANGEROUS AND CAN CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH
gmXwsuHe1Zo_6 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO ROCK CLIMB THAT YOU GET THE PROPER INSTRUCTION FROM A QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL
gmXwsuHe1Zo_7 0 THE BEST WAY TO START ROCK CLIMBING 101 IS TO FIND YOUR LOCAL INDOOR ROCK CLIMBING GYM AND BEGIN THE PROCESS THERE
gmXwsuHe1Zo_8 0 LEARNING ROCK CLIMBING 101 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU LEARN ALL THE SAFETY ASPECTS OF CLIMBING
gmXwsuHe1Zo_9 0 HOW A HARNESS WORKS

GZl_mP67NsA_1 0 SO THE NEXT STEP AFTER YOU'VE TUNED WITH THE PIANO BEFORE YOU START PLAYING IS THAT YOU WANT TO FIND A GOOD POSITION IN FRONT OF THE PIANO
GZl_mP67NsA_2 0 SO IF YOU PRETEND THE PIANO IS RIGHT HERE AND SAY YOU HAVE THE ACCOMPANIST RIGHT HERE ALONG WITH THE PAGE-TURNER
GZl_mP67NsA_3 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN HAVE A SIGHT LINE WITH THE ACCOMPANIST
GZl_mP67NsA_4 0 IT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A SIGHT LINE WITH THE PAGE-TURNER BECAUSE REALLY ALL THEIR MAIN JOB IS IS JUST TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE TURNING THE PAGES SO THE PIANIST CAN KEEP PLAYING STRAIGHT THROUGH WITH YOU
GZl_mP67NsA_5 0 SO REALLY POSITIONING YOURSELF RIGHT AFTER YOU'VE TUNED FINDING A GOOD SPOT MAYBE RIGHT HERE SO THAT THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF AN ANGLE
GZl_mP67NsA_6 0 THERE SHOULD BE SOMEWHAT OF A LITTLE ANGLE BETWEEN YOU AND THE PIANIST
GZl_mP67NsA_7 0 SO YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE TO THEM THAT YOU'RE READY
GZl_mP67NsA_8 0 ONCE YOU'VE FOUND YOUR POSITION THEN YOU CAN SET UP YOUR VIOLIN AND GIVE THEM A SIGNAL
GZl_mP67NsA_9 0 AND DEPENDING ON WHAT PIECE YOU'RE PLAYING SOME PIECES THERE WILL BE A PIANO INTRO OR SOME PIECES YOU START PLAYING WITH THE PIANO
GZl_mP67NsA_10 0 IF THERE IS A PIANO INTRO ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS POSITION YOURSELF AND THEN JUST GIVE THEM THE SIGNAL THAT YOU'RE READY
GZl_mP67NsA_11 0 BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT PLAYING IN THE BEGINNING ALL THEY NEED IS A LITTLE SIGNAL TO LET THEM KNOW THAT YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN
HBaiiL17ai0_1 0 A QUESTION THAT OFTEN COMES UP REGARDING THE DIDGERIDOO IS AM I STUCK WITH THAT ONE NOTE THAT FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY
HBaiiL17ai0_2 0 THE ANSWER IS BASICALLY YES
HBaiiL17ai0_3 0 YOU PRETTY MUCH ARE
HBaiiL17ai0_4 0 THAT'S BASED ON THE LENGTH OF THIS TUBE
HBaiiL17ai0_5 0 THAT'S THE WAY THE INSTRUMENT FUNCTIONS
HBaiiL17ai0_6 0 WITH THAT SAID THERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU CAN DO TO KIND OF FORCE SOME OTHER NOTES OUT OF IT
HBaiiL17ai0_7 0 ON THIS PARTICULAR DIDGERIDOO WHICH IS BASICALLY A LOW E AS WE'VE HEARD BEFORE
HBaiiL17ai0_8 0 BY PUSHING THE AIR A LITTLE FASTER AND BY PUSHING MY LOWER LIP OUTWARD I CAN KIND OF FORCE IT UP ABOUT A HALF STEP
HBaiiL17ai0_9 0 THAT'S ONE WAY YOU CAN GET A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PITCH OUT OF IT
HBaiiL17ai0_10 0 TO A CERTAIN EXTENT YOU CAN ALSO FORCE THE NOTE DOWN
HBaiiL17ai0_11 0 IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE THE SAME RESIDENT QUALITY AS THAT FUNDAMENTAL THAT WE'VE HAD ALL ALONG BUT IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO START WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL ONE
HBaiiL17ai0_12 0 THEN BY PUSHING THE CORNERS OF MY MOUTH DOWN I CAN KIND OF GET A NOTE BELOW THAT BASIC FUNDAMENTAL
HBaiiL17ai0_13 0 THAT TENDS TO TAKE A LOT OF PRACTICE
HBaiiL17ai0_14 0 THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I LEARNED OVER THE YEARS PLAYING TRUMPET AND I WAS ABLE TO APPLY IT TO THIS
HBaiiL17ai0_15 0 YOU ALSO FIND THAT DIDGERIDOOS THE INDIVIDUAL INSTRUMENTS WILL VARY A LOT IN THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT
HBaiiL17ai0_16 0 THIS PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES BECAUSE I CAN PUSH IT BOTH UP AND DOWN TO A LARGE EXTENT
HBaiiL17ai0_17 0 IT WORKS PRETTY WELL
HBaiiL17ai0_18 0 SOME DIDGERIDOOS ARE VERY LOCKED IN
HBaiiL17ai0_19 0 THEY DON'T SEEM TO DO THAT AT ALL
HBaiiL17ai0_20 0 IF YOUR INSTRUMENT DOESN'T SEEM TO WANT TO DO THAT THAT'S OKAY BUT IT IS ONE WAY TO GET SOME OTHER NOTES OUT OF THE DIDGERIDOO AT LEAST THAT SLIGHT VARIATION ON JUST THAT ONE FUNDAMENTAL
HBaiiL17ai0_21 0 THAT'S SOME WAYS YOU CAN GET SOME SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PITCHES OUT OF AN INDIVIDUAL INSTRUMENT
HBaiiL17ai0_22 0 IF YOU REALLY NEED AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT KEY A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PITCH YOUR ONLY SOLUTION UNFORTUNATELY IS TO HAVE MULTIPLE DIDGERIDOOS OF DIFFERENT KEYS
HBaiiL17ai0_23 0 IT CAN BE A LITTLE DECEIVING
HBaiiL17ai0_24 0 IN GENERAL THE PITCH OF THE INSTRUMENT IS DETERMINED BY ITS LENGTH BUT THE PHYSICS AND THE GEOMETRY THING CAN BE A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT
HBaiiL17ai0_25 0 THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO KNOW IS TO TRY THE INSTRUMENT OUT AND SEE WHAT KEY IT'S IN
HBaiiL17ai0_26 0 IF YOU'RE SHOPPING FOR ONE ONLINE TYPICALLY ON WEBSITES I'VE SEEN THAT THEY'LL PUT THE KEY OF THAT INSTRUMENT SO YOU CAN AT LEAST KNOW AHEAD OF TIME WHAT IT IS
HBaiiL17ai0_27 0 TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THESE TWO DIDGERIDOOS WHICH SEEM TO BE ABOUT THE SAME LENGTH ACTUALLY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCIES
HBaiiL17ai0_28 0 THIS ONE IS ROUGHLY AN E AND THIS ONE IS CLOSER TO A LOW D YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN THAT JUST BY LOOKING SO IF YOU'RE SHOPPING FOR A DIDGERIDOO THAT NEEDS TO BE IN A SPECIFIC KEY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU GO AND PLAY IT AND TRY IT OUT AND KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT YOU'RE GETTING
hjzcMrlaP58_1 0 SERRATED KNIVES CAN BE SHARPENED
hjzcMrlaP58_2 0 MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO SHARPEN THESE CORRECTLY AND THE COMMON MISTAKE IS THAT THEY'LL SHARPEN THE BACKSIDE WHICH WILL BRING A BUR UP AND WILL MAKE IT SHARP TEMPORARILY BUT WHAT YOU'RE BASICALLY DOING IS WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT IS YOU'RE GRINDING OFF THE SERRATIONS AND MAKING YOUR KNIFE INTO A STRAIGHT EDGE KNIFE
hjzcMrlaP58_3 0 THE CORRECT WAY TO SHARPEN A SERRATED KNIFE IS TO GET SOME KIND OF ROUND SHARPENING INSTRUMENT I SUGGEST CERAMIC
hjzcMrlaP58_4 0 SOME PEOPLE WILL USE RAT TAIL FILES I SUGGEST CERAMIC AND WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS GO IN EACH LITTLE GROOVE SEPARATELY
hjzcMrlaP58_5 0 YOU'VE GOT TO SHARPEN EACH LITTLE GROOVE
hjzcMrlaP58_6 0 AGAIN IT'S SAFEST TO PULL IT AWAY
hjzcMrlaP58_7 0 YOU CAN SHARPEN LIKE THIS BUT IT'S SAFEST TO PULL IT AWAY FROM YOU
hjzcMrlaP58_8 0 IT'S TIME-CONSUMING BUT YOU NEED TO HAVE PATIENCE AND GO IN EACH LITTLE GROOVE SEPARATELY AND THEN ONCE YOU'VE GOT A BUT UP YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FEEL THE BUR ALONG THE BACKSIDE THEN JUST LIKE WITH A STRAIGHT EDGE KNIFE YOU GO BACK TO THE GOOD OLD LEATHER STRAP
hjzcMrlaP58_9 0 YOU STRAP THE BACKSIDE AND YOU STRAP THE SERRATIONS
hjzcMrlaP58_10 0 REMEMBER WHAT YOU DO TO ONE SIDE YOU DO TO THE OTHER AND THIS LEATHER STRAP WILL MAKE THIS SERRATED KNIFE WHERE IT WILL SHAVE HAIR JUST LIKE A STRAIGHT EDGE KNIFE
G8DHXsDsSVM_1 0 HI THIS IS VIC SOSIKIAN I'M WITH MARK MATTHEW FINE GENTLEMAN'S GROOMING CLUB IN STUDIO CITY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE

G8DHXsDsSVM_3 0 WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW TO PREPARE FOR THE SHAVE AND HOW TO SHAVE THE RIGHT WAY
G8DHXsDsSVM_4 0 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CONCLUDE THE SHAVE IN THE RIGHT WAY AS WELL TO BE SURE HTAT YOU HAVE NO PROBLEMS AFTER YOU ARE DONE SHAVING
G8DHXsDsSVM_5 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO TAKE A COLD TOWEL BASICALLY YOU CAN WET A TOWEL OR IF YOU DON'T HAVE A TOWEL YOU COULD JUST SPLASH COLD WATER ON YOUR FACE AFTER YOU ARE DONE SHAVING
G8DHXsDsSVM_6 0 WHAT THIS DOES IT CLOSES THE PORES THAT WE OPEN WITH THE HOT TOWEL OR THE HOT WATER
G8DHXsDsSVM_7 0 NEXT YOU WANT TO APPLY HIGH QUALITY AFTER SHAVE BALM
G8DHXsDsSVM_8 0 TO AVOID AFTER SHAVE AFTER YOU SHAVE BECAUSE THAT STING FUNCTION IS NOT NECESSARY AND IT IS KIND OF PAINFUL
G8DHXsDsSVM_9 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS GET SOME LIKE THAT NICE HIGH QUALITY AFTERSHAVE BALM IN YOUR HAND MASSAGE IT AND APPLY IT TO YOUR FACE EVERYWHERE YOU SHAVED
G8DHXsDsSVM_10 0 YOU CAN MASSAGE IT IN NICE AND SMOOTH ALL OVER MAKE SURE YOU GET EVERYTHING
G8DHXsDsSVM_11 0 ONCE YOU ARE DONE WITH THE AFTER SHAVE BALM APPLICATION IT SHOULD FEEL THAT YOUR SKIN IS A LITTLE DRY YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND USE MOISTURIZER AND APPLY IT JUST THE WAY YOUR DID YOUR AFTERSHAVE AND APPLY THE DIRECTION OF YOUR GROWTH OF THE HAIR TO MAKE SURE YOUR SKIN IS NOT DRY OR IRRITATED
H0L_cI18vQA_1 0 OKAY LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW WE OPEN THIS COCONUT SO WE CAN USE IT
H0L_cI18vQA_2 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO UNWRAP THIS LITTLE GUY HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO FIRST WE'RE GOING TO GET THE WATER OUT OF IT
H0L_cI18vQA_3 0 THERE'S SOME IN THERE
H0L_cI18vQA_4 0 SO THIS IS THE THIS LOOKS LIKE THE TOP BUT IT'S NOT
H0L_cI18vQA_5 0 THIS IS ACTUALLY HOW IT HANGS IS RIGHT LIKE THAT WHEN IT'S GROWING
H0L_cI18vQA_6 0 OF COURSE IT HAS ALL THE GREEN STUFF ON IT
H0L_cI18vQA_7 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO LOOK FOR A HOLE HERE THAT'S REAL EASY TO POUR THE WATER OUT BUT NOT ALWAYS EASY TO FIND
H0L_cI18vQA_8 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR KNIFE HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO START STABBING IN HERE AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND THAT THAT HOLE THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR
H0L_cI18vQA_9 0 AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE HARD TO FIND
H0L_cI18vQA_10 0 NOW I'M NOT REALLY PUSHING TOO HARD I'M JUST TRYING TO TO LOCATE IT
H0L_cI18vQA_11 0 AND AH THERE IT IS
H0L_cI18vQA_12 0 SEE THERE WE WENT THERE AND BOOM IN THE KNIFE WENT
H0L_cI18vQA_13 0 AND ONCE WE GET THERE WE'RE GOING TO JUST TURN THE KNIFE HOLD THE KNIFE AND TURN THE COCONUT LIKE SO AND OPEN UP A HOLE IN THERE
H0L_cI18vQA_14 0 SEE WE'RE IT'S OPENING UP THERE
H0L_cI18vQA_15 0 AND THAT'S HOW YOU YOU OPEN THE COCONUT TO GET THE FLUIDS OUT
GfqmQI9SAMM_1 0 HI I'M MIKE LOPEZ WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'LL BE DISCUSSING ARTIFACTS FROM MAGIC THE GATHERING
GfqmQI9SAMM_2 0 AND NOW I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT FARSIGHT MASK
GfqmQI9SAMM_3 0 FARSIGHT MASK IS A VERY IMPORTANT VERY POWERFUL CARD THAT CAN CHANGE THE STATE OF A GAME
GfqmQI9SAMM_4 0 IT IS AN UNCOMMON AS WE SEE FROM HERE
GfqmQI9SAMM_5 0 IT IS AN ARTIFACT WHICH MEANS IT GETS TO STAY IN PLAY UNTIL IT IS DESTROYED BY SOMETHING THAT DESTROYS ARTIFACTS
GfqmQI9SAMM_6 0 AND FARSIGHT MASK COSTS YOU FIVE COLORLESS TO PUT OUT
GfqmQI9SAMM_7 0 NOW WHAT FARSIGHT MASK DOES IS THAT WHENEVER A SOURCE AN OPPONENT CONTROLS DEALS DAMAGE TO YOU IF FARSIGHT MASK IS UNTAPPED YOU MAY DRAW A CARD
GfqmQI9SAMM_8 0 WHICH MEANS THAT WHENEVER ANY SOURCE OF YOUR OPPONENT'S CARDS WHICH CARDS ARE SOURCES DEALS DAMAGE TO YOU EVEN IF IT'S ONE DAMAGE OR IF IT'S THREE DAMAGE DOES NOT MATTER AS LONG AS IT'S A SOURCE
GfqmQI9SAMM_9 0 SO FOR EVERY RESOURCE THAT DEALS DAMAGE TO YOU YOU MAY DRAW A CARD
GfqmQI9SAMM_10 0 WHICH MEANS IF HE HAS THREE ONE/ONES THAT HIT YOU YOU MAY DRAW THREE CARDS
GfqmQI9SAMM_11 0 THIS IS ANOTHER CARD THAT ALLOWS YOU TO CYCLE THROUGH YOUR LIBRARY FASTER SO YOU CAN GET TO THE CARDS TO ALLOW YOU TO WIN THE GAME
g_EiHqgz-G8_1 0 NOW THAT WE KNOW HOW TO HOLD OUR PARTNER WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THE BASIC STEPS TOGETHER AS A COUPLE

g_EiHqgz-G8_6 0 THE GUY IS GOING TO START FORWARD AND LADIES OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO START BACK ON ONE
g_EiHqgz-G8_7 0 LADIES THE BIG THING HERE IS TO REMEMBER IS THAT THE GUY IS IN CHARGE
g_EiHqgz-G8_8 0 I KNOW IT SUCKS SOMETIMES BUT WE'VE GOT TO LET HIM HAVE THIS TURN TO BE IN CHARGE
g_EiHqgz-G8_9 0 HE'S GOING TO BE THE LEADER AND WE HAVE TO BE THE FOLLOWER
g_EiHqgz-G8_10 0 I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO BACK UNTIL YOU FEEL HIM PUSHING YOU

g_EiHqgz-G8_14 0 FIVE SIX SEVEN FORWARD TWO THREE BACK SIX SEVEN THIS IS ONE TWO THREE PAUSE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN PAUSE EIGHT ONE TWO THREE FIVE SIX SEVEN ONE MORE TIME FIVE SIX SEVEN
gomI_utk5YM_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT OPEN CHORDS AND IT IS THE FIRST LIKE BASIC CHORDS YOU LEARN WHEN LEARNING HOW TO PLAY GUITAR
gomI_utk5YM_2 0 OPEN CHORDS BASICALLY TALKS ABOUT FIRST POSITION CHORDS WHICH IS WITHIN THE FIRST THREE FRETS AND THEY ARE CALLED OPEN CHORDS BECAUSE YOU ARE UTILIZING OPEN STRINGS ON ALL OF THESE CHORDS
gomI_utk5YM_3 0 NOW OPEN STRINGS MEANS SIMPLY PLAYING THEM OPEN
gomI_utk5YM_4 0 SO YOU ARE NOT FRETTING THEM LIKE [STRUM GUITAR] YOU ARE PLAYING THEM OPEN WHICH MEANS SIMPLY THAT THEY ARE NOT FRETTED
gomI_utk5YM_5 0 THE FIRST CHORD I LIKE TO SHOW YOU IS THE G MAJOR CHORD
gomI_utk5YM_6 0 AND ESSENTIALLY THERE IS SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS TO MAKE THIS CHORD BUT THE PRIMARY WAY IS WHERE YOU PLACE YOUR FINGERS AND THE FINGERS ARE ONE THE INDEX TWO FOR THE MIDDLE THREE FOR THE RING FINGER AND FOUR FOR THE PINKIE
gomI_utk5YM_7 0 NOW ON THE G CHORD YOU ARE GOING TO START WITH YOUR SECOND FINGER ON THE THIRD FRET THE LOW E STRING WHICH IS NOTE G YOUR FIRST FINGER IS GOING TO BE ON THE SECOND FRET OR B AND THEN YOUR RING FINGER IS GOING TO BE ON THE HIGH E STRING G SINCE THESE ARE THE SAME NOTES
gomI_utk5YM_8 0 AND IF YOU STRUM ALL SIX STRINGS YOU'LL COME OUT WITH [STRUM GUITAR] AND THAT IS A G MAJOR CHORD
gomI_utk5YM_9 0 THERE IS A SIMPLER WAY TO MAKE THIS CHORD
gomI_utk5YM_10 0 YOU CAN SIMPLY TAKE YOUR OR ANY FINGER YOU WANT BUT PREFERABLY YOUR RING FINGER AND START WITH THE G HERE [STRUM GUITAR] TO MAKE A SIMPLER CHORD
gomI_utk5YM_11 0 OR YOU CAN MAKE THE SAME POSITION EXCEPT PUT YOUR RING FINGER ON THE B STRING ON THE THIRD FRET AND YOUR PINKIE ON THE THIRD FRET ON THE HIGH E STRING AND HAVE A SLIGHTLY FORCE SOUNDING CHORD
gomI_utk5YM_12 0 AND THAT IS YOUR G MAJOR CHORD
gs-L3zz_KDM_1 0 THE BID OF NIL
gs-L3zz_KDM_2 0 NIL IS THE STRONGEST WEAPON THAT YOU HAVE IN THE GAME OF SPADES
gs-L3zz_KDM_3 0 BY THE WAY THERE IS ANOTHER BID CALLED BLIND NIL OR DOUBLE NIL
gs-L3zz_KDM_4 0 DOUBLE NIL IS A BID DESIGNED PRIMARILY AND THAT'S NOT THIS HAND BUT DOUBLE NIL IS DESIGNED PRIMARILY TO HELP RESCUE A LOST GAME
gs-L3zz_KDM_5 0 IN OTHER WORDS YOU'RE LOSING BY TWO-HUNDRED POINTS AND YOU THROW OUT WHAT'S CALLED A BLIND NIL
gs-L3zz_KDM_6 0 BLIND NIL FORGET THIS HAND FOR THE MOMENT SUPPOSING THAT THIS WAS YOUR HAND WHEN YOU BID A BLIND NIL YOU'RE TELLING THE COMPUTER THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LOOK AT YOUR HAND BUT YOU HOPE YOU SURE DON'T HAVE THE ACE OF SPADES IN YOUR HAND
gs-L3zz_KDM_7 0 BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE THE ACE OF SPADES OR A BAD ACE IN YOUR HANDS YOU'RE GOING TO GET SAD INSTANTLY
gs-L3zz_KDM_8 0 IN OTHER WORDS YOU DON'T GET TO SEE YOUR CARDS BUT YOU MAKE THIS ATTEMPT TO TAKE TWO-HUNDRED POINTS AND IF YOU TURN YOUR HAND OVER AND YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS YOU SAY OH MY GOD I'M SET
gs-L3zz_KDM_9 0 I CAN NOT MAKE THIS NIL
gs-L3zz_KDM_10 0 SO I DON'T EVEN PLAY GAMES WITH BLIND NILS
gs-L3zz_KDM_11 0 WE DON'T ALLOW THEM IN THE TOURNAMENTS AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ONLINE DON'T LIKE TO USE THEM BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE A GAME STOLEN FROM THEM BECAUSE SOMEBODY GOT INCREDIBLY LUCKY
gs-L3zz_KDM_12 0 SO THE BLIND NIL BID IS A BIT OF DESPERATION
gs-L3zz_KDM_13 0 A STANDARD NIL WILL AWARD YOU WITH ONE-HUNDRED POINTS IF YOU SUCCESSFULLY MAKE THAT BID
gs-L3zz_KDM_14 0 NOW LET'S LOOK AT THIS HAND
gs-L3zz_KDM_15 0 YOU DO HAVE THE ACE OF CLUBS BUT YOU HAVE THREE SMALL ONES SO THE PROBABILITY OF YOUR MAKING THIS BID ARE PRETTY GOOD
gs-L3zz_KDM_16 0 PARTICULARLY SINCE YOU HAVE THE DEUCE AND THE FIVE AND THE EIGHT
gs-L3zz_KDM_17 0 I MEAN CHANCES ARE THE OPPONENTS THE ONLY WAY THAT THIS BID WOULD BE SET WITH THIS ACE IS THAT ONE OPPONENT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE KING QUEEN JACK TEN OR SOMETHING OF THAT ILK
gs-L3zz_KDM_18 0 YOUR PARTNER WOULD HAVE TO HAVE FOUR MIDDLE SPOTS AND HE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE ONE IN THE VOID AND JUST KEEPS PLOWING THOUGH THE ERASE
gs-L3zz_KDM_19 0 CHANCES ARE THAT YOUR PARTNER WILL BE TRUMPING THE FOURTH ROUND OF THIS SUIT
gs-L3zz_KDM_20 0 THIS HEART SET IS COMPLETELY SAFE
gs-L3zz_KDM_21 0 THE SINGLES AND DIAMOND IS GOOD
gs-L3zz_KDM_22 0 THE ONLY RISK FACTOR IN THIS NIL IS THIS KIND OF SPADES
gs-L3zz_KDM_23 0 THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TWO SMALLER SPADES WITH IT IS VERY ENCOURAGING BECAUSE EITHER YOUR PARTNER COULD HAVE THE JACK QUEEN KING OR ACE OF SPADES WHICH IS ABOUT EIGHTY-FIVE PERCENT PROBABILITY
gs-L3zz_KDM_24 0 THERE'S JUST SO MANY PROBABILITIES IN THE GAME
gs-L3zz_KDM_25 0 BY THE WAY THE HIGHER YOUR PARTNER BIDS THE MORE LIKELY THAT HE HAS THE TRUMP
gs-L3zz_KDM_26 0 IF YOUR PARTNER IS BIDDING SIX
gwv47JMxteQ_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS RUSSELL KOMPINSKI AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE WE ARE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO PURCHASE AND ASSEMBLE A SKATEBOARD
gwv47JMxteQ_2 0 AT TIMES YOU CAN BUY THE TRUCKS WITH THE WHEELS INTACT
gwv47JMxteQ_3 0 HOWEVER I'M TAKING OTHER WHEELS AND PLACING THEM ON THIS DECK
gwv47JMxteQ_4 0 THE FIRST THING WHEN ASSEMBLING WHEELS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TWO BEARINGS FOR ONE WHEEL
gwv47JMxteQ_5 0 A PACK OF BEARING WILL HAVE EIGHT BEARINGS TWO FOR EACH WHEEL CAUSE THERE'S FOUR WHEELS
gwv47JMxteQ_6 0 I'M PLACING THE BEARING IN THE WHEEL
gwv47JMxteQ_7 0 YOU'RE GOING TO PLACE THE PLATED SIDE WE'LL HEAR IT IT'S IN BLACK
gwv47JMxteQ_8 0 THE OTHER SIDE IS SILVER
gwv47JMxteQ_9 0 YOU'LL PUT THE SILVER SIDE INSIDE AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUSH DOWN
gwv47JMxteQ_10 0 WHAT I DO IS I USE MY DECK
gwv47JMxteQ_11 0 I SET IT UP AND THEN I PLACE IT RIGHT ON THE SHAFT AND PUSH DOWN TO GET IT ALL THE WAY ON
gwv47JMxteQ_12 0 THE SAME WITH THE OTHER SIDE
gwv47JMxteQ_13 0 ALL OF YOUR WHEELS ARE GENERALLY MADE OUT OF POLYURETHANE
gwv47JMxteQ_14 0 SO NOW THOSE ARE IN AND THEY ROLL
gwv47JMxteQ_15 0 THESE GENERALLY COME WITH LITTLE WASHERS AND YOU CAN JUST THROW THAT RIGHT ON THE BACK
gwv47JMxteQ_16 0 FOR THIS INSTANT IF YOU ARE PUTTING ON OLD WHEELS IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO CHANGE THEM AROUND SO THEY'RE THE FRONTS ARE GENERALLY FACED OUT YOU'RE JUST GOING TO WANT TO FLIP THEM BACKWARDS AND YOU CAN JUST PUT THEM ON THAT SO THEY'LL BE ALMOST LIKE NEW WHEELS
gwv47JMxteQ_17 0 IF YOU HAVE NEW WHEELS THEN IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER ALTHOUGH THE LOGO GENERALLY GOES OUT
Ggi8J6RKHUA_1 0 HI I'M MARK MIDDLEBROOK AND I'M HERE IN THE PAUL MARCUS WINES CELLAR AND IN THIS SEGMENT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SPARKLING WINE PRODUCTION METHODS BUT SPECIFICALLY THE TWO MAIN METHODS THAT ARE USED TO MAKE MOST OF THE SPARKLING WINES IN THE WORLD WHETHER THEY COME FROM CHAMPAGNE IN FRANCE OR ITALY OR SPAIN OR THE U.S OR ANYWHERE ELSE
Ggi8J6RKHUA_2 0 THIS GENERALLY SIMPLER AND LESS EXPENSIVE METHOD IS CALLED THE BULK PROCESS OR THE CHARMAT METHOD NAMED AFTER A FRENCH GUY WHO DEVELOPED IT MANY YEARS AGO
Ggi8J6RKHUA_3 0 AND THE IDEA IS YOU TAKE THE WINE AND YOU PUT IT INTO A LARGE VESSEL USUALLY STAINLESS STEEL THESE DAYS AND THEN YOU ESSENTIALLY INJECT CARBON DIOXIDE INTO IT AND THAT'S HOW THE BUBBLES GET THERE
Ggi8J6RKHUA_4 0 IT'S VERY EFFICIENT YOU KNOW ONCE YOU HAVE THE STEEL TANK THERE
Ggi8J6RKHUA_5 0 AS A RESULT YOU CAN MAKE A SPARKLING WINE THAT'S YOU KNOW RELATIVELY MODEST IN COST YOU KNOW TEN TO FIFTEEN TO TWENTY DOLLARS FOR GENERALLY A CHARMAT BULK METHOD WINE
Ggi8J6RKHUA_6 0 THE WINES TEND TO BE FRUITY A LITTLE BIT SIMPLER LARGER BUBBLES BUT PERFECTLY SATISFYING GREAT BRUNCH WINES GREAT FOR STARTING OFF AN EVERYDAY DINNER
Ggi8J6RKHUA_7 0 NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS STYLE OF SPARKLING WINE
Ggi8J6RKHUA_8 0 THE MORE INVOLVED AND CERTAINLY MORE EXPENSIVE PROCESS IN TERMS OF EFFORT IS CALLED IS TYPICALLY CALLED THE METHODE CHAMPENOISE THE CHAMPAGNE METHOD
Ggi8J6RKHUA_9 0 BECAUSE IT WAS PERHAPS NOT INVENTED IN CHAMPAGNE THERE'S A LOT OF ARGUMENT ABOUT THAT BUT IT CERTAINLY HAS REACHED ITS ACME THERE AND IT'S WHERE IT'S BEST KNOWN
Ggi8J6RKHUA_10 0 IT'S ALSO CALLED YOU'LL SEE ON LABELS METHODE TRADITIONNEL TRADITIONAL METHOD OR METHODE CLASSIQUE THE CLASSIC METHOD
Ggi8J6RKHUA_11 0 ALL SYNONYMS FOR THE SAME BASIC PROCESS
Ggi8J6RKHUA_12 0 SO AGAIN THEY START BY MAKING WINE MAKING PRETTY MUCH ORDINARY WINE AND THEN INSTEAD OF PUTTING IT INTO A BIG VESSEL AFTER THE FERMENTATION IS COMPLETE THEY ADD A LITTLE BIT OF YEAST AND A LITTLE BIT OF SUGAR AND THAT ACTIVATES WHAT IS CALLED A SECONDARY FERMENTATION IN THE BOTTLE
Ggi8J6RKHUA_13 0 THEY CAP IT OFF AND DO THIS ALL IN THE BOTTLE
Ggi8J6RKHUA_14 0 SO IT'S THE SECONDARY FERMENTATION IN THE BOTTLE THAT CREATES THE BUBBLES BECAUSE THERE'S NOWHERE FOR THE BUBBLING STUFF THAT THE YEAST CREATES BY EATING THE SUGAR
Ggi8J6RKHUA_15 0 THERE'S NOWHERE THAT THERE'S NOWHERE FOR THAT TO GO SO IT DISSOLVES INTO THE WINE AND CREATES THE BUBBLES THAT YOU SEE WHEN YOU DRINK IT
Ggi8J6RKHUA_16 0 CHAMPAGNE IS THE MOST FAMOUS METHODE CHAMPENOISE METHODE TRADITIONNEL WINE BUT MANY THERE ARE MANY OTHER GOOD EXAMPLES CAVA FROM SPAIN CERTAIN MANY SPARKLING WINES FROM THE UNITED STATES
Ggi8J6RKHUA_17 0 I'VE HAD A FEW GOOD ONES FROM TASMANIA AND EVEN IN ITALY IN FRANCIACORTA FOR EXAMPLE THEY MAKE NICE METHODE TRADITIONNEL WINES
Ggi8J6RKHUA_18 0 SO THIS TEND BE A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE AGAIN THERE'S A LOT MORE EFFORT INVOLVED TO MAKE THE WINE THIS WAY BUT YOU GET A BIT MORE ELEGANT WINE
Ggi8J6RKHUA_19 0 THESE ARE GOING GREAT EVERYDAY SPARKLERS THAT YOU CAN USE TO ENJOY SPARKLING WINE MORE OFTEN
gEA3qjf-3DM_1 0 AFTER YOU HAVE YOUR CLUB SINGLE THROW DOWN PRETTY CLEAN WHERE YOU CAN TAKE YOUR CLUB IN EACH HAND AND THROW IT TO THE OTHER WITHOUT REALLY WORRYING ABOUT IT WHEN IT JUST GOES WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO
gEA3qjf-3DM_2 0 YOU NEED TO PICK UP A SECOND CLUB START WORKING WITH TWO
gEA3qjf-3DM_3 0 WHEN YOU START JUGGLING WITH CLUBS YOU CAN'T FORGET EVERYTHING YOU'VE LEARNED WHEN YOU START JUGGLING WITH BALLS
gEA3qjf-3DM_4 0 ALL THE THROWS HAVE TO BE THE SAME HEIGHT THEY HAVE TO GO IN THE SAME RHYTHM SO IT SHOULD BE THROW THROW CATCH CATCH
gEA3qjf-3DM_5 0 YOU HAVE TO HOLD YOUR POSTURE PRETTY GOOD YOU NEED TO HAVE FEET SHOULDER WIDTH APART BENT ELBOWS STANDING HERE NATURALLY AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE THROWING FROM THE ELBOW SO THAT IT COMES ACROSS LIKE THIS
gEA3qjf-3DM_6 0 LET'S JUST JUMP RIGHT IN
gEA3qjf-3DM_7 0 YOU'RE GOING TO GRAB ONE CLUB IN EACH HAND AND START THROW THROW CATCH CATCH JUST LIKE YOU DID WHEN YOU LEARNED THREE BALLS YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN THIS WITH CLUBS
gEA3qjf-3DM_8 0 EACH THROW HAS TO GO ACROSS SINGLE SPIN AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S IN TIME SO THAT IT'S THROW THROW CATCH CATCH
gEA3qjf-3DM_9 0 I WANT YOU TO PRACTICE WITH BOTH HANDS MEANING YOU START WITH YOUR RIGHT HANDS AND THEN DO IT WITH YOUR LEFT FIRST
gEA3qjf-3DM_10 0 SO IT'S LEFT RIGHT CATCH CATCH RIGHT LEFT CATCH CATCH
gEA3qjf-3DM_11 0 I WANT YOU TO TRY AND KEEP THAT GOING AS FLUIDLY AS POSSIBLE RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT
gEA3qjf-3DM_12 0 YOU NEED TO PRACTICE THAT UNTIL YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT UNTIL ALL THE SPINS WORK OUT PRETTY WELL AND YOU NEED TO REALIZE THERE'S THAT GAP IN BETWEEN THE TWO CLUBS AND WHEN WE MOVE ON THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO ADD THE THIRD CLUB IN
gEA3qjf-3DM_13 0 SO SIT HERE PRACTICING RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT MAKE SURE YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR POSTURE THINK ABOUT YOUR THROWS THINK ABOUT THE SPIN A LOT OF THINGS TO KEEP TRACK OF I KNOW BUT PRACTICE ENOUGH AND YOU'LL GET IT CLEAN
gPPDoNCUEgM_1 0 SO I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TIME-MANNERED TECHNIQUE WHICH IS WHICH IS CALLED TRACING
gPPDoNCUEgM_2 0 AND THE WHOLE IDEA OF TRACING HAS TO DO WITH FIGURING OUT WHERE THINGS ARE GOING TO GO DECIDING HOW TO PUT THEM THERE PUTTING THEM IN THE RIGHT PLACE
gPPDoNCUEgM_3 0 SO IN THIS CASE WHAT I'M AFTER IS A P THAT I WANT TO PUT RIGHT HERE SO THAT I END UP WITH PLACING AND SPACING
gPPDoNCUEgM_4 0 SO JUST HAPPENS TO HAVE A P OVER HERE THAT I HAVE DESIGNED AND SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M JUST GOING TO TRACE OVER IT AND I CAN BE MAKING LITTLE ADJUSTMENTS ALONG THE WAY SAY I WANT TO CHANGE THAT SHAPE JUST A LITTLE TINY BIT
gPPDoNCUEgM_5 0 MAYBE I WANT TO MAKE THIS LONGER
gPPDoNCUEgM_6 0 IT'S JUST THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU RUN INTO TO DO IN A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT KIND OF WORK
gPPDoNCUEgM_7 0 AND GUESS WHO IS RUSHING THE JOB
gPPDoNCUEgM_8 0 IN REAL LIFE YOU GOT TO GO SLOWER THAN THIS
gPPDoNCUEgM_9 0 NOW LET'S SAY THAT I DECIDE THAT THAT'S JUST THE WAY I WANT IT
gPPDoNCUEgM_10 0 I WANT IT TO LOOK ABOUT LIKE THAT
gPPDoNCUEgM_12 0 SO I MAYBE WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE THAT
gPPDoNCUEgM_13 0 NO I WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE THAT
gPPDoNCUEgM_14 0 MAKE UP YOUR MIND
gPPDoNCUEgM_15 0 THINK ABOUT THIS
gPPDoNCUEgM_16 0 THINK ABOUT HOW THIS GOES AND THIS GOES
gPPDoNCUEgM_18 0 SO NOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO IF I WANT TO TRACE THIS I'VE GOT TO GET AND TRACE THE BACK
gxoXqMWJ8dY_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M ERIC WILLIAMS AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT READING MUSIC
gxoXqMWJ8dY_2 0 SO FOLLOWING UP WITH OUR DISCUSSION OF FLATS LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SHARPS
gxoXqMWJ8dY_3 0 IF WE MOVE TO THE NEXT MEASURE WE HAVE AN F AND WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE BASE CLEF AND THE BASE CLEF HAS THE DOT ABOVE AND BELOW F LINE SO THAT IS A DEAD GIVE A WAY IF YOU WANT TO TRY YOUR GOOD BOYS DOES FINE ALWAYS AND IT WILL ALSO BRING YOU TO F ANYWAY HERE'S F AND THE VERY NEXT NOTE IS F WITH A SHARP SYMBOL IN FRONT OF IT
gxoXqMWJ8dY_4 0 THAT MEANS TO RAISE THE F A HALF STEP HIGHER
gxoXqMWJ8dY_5 0 THEN THE VERY NOTE IS ALSO ON F BUT WE HAVE THAT NATURAL SIGN IN FRONT OF THE F SO I'LL BET BY NOW YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY THAT'S THERE BUT LET ME TELL YOU ANYWAY
gxoXqMWJ8dY_6 0 THIS F SHARP WOULD NORMALLY IMPACT THIS F AND MAKE IT A SHARP ALSO BECAUSE THAT IS THE RULES OF ACCIDENTAL
gxoXqMWJ8dY_7 0 ACCIDENTALS BY THE WAY IS THE NAME FOR ALL OF THESE THINGS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
gxoXqMWJ8dY_8 0 ACCIDENTALS INCORPORATE FLATS SYMBOLS SHARP SYMBOLS AND NATURAL SYMBOLS
gxoXqMWJ8dY_9 0 SO THE ACCIDENTAL ON THE F SHARP WOULD NORMALLY MAKE THIS AN F SHARP BUT SINCE IN THIS CASE WE DON'T WANT THIS TO BE SHARP WE HAVE TO USE THE NATURAL SIGN TO REDUCE THIS BACK TO REGULAR F WE HAVE F F SHARP AND F NATURAL
gxoXqMWJ8dY_10 0 AGAIN WHY WE DON'T HAVE A NATURAL SIGN IN FRONT OF THIS F IS BECAUSE IT IS UNDERSTOOD IT IS PLAIN F AND WE DON'T NEED TO PUT A NATURAL IN FRONT OF IT
gxoXqMWJ8dY_11 0 THAT WOULD JUST CONFUSE PEOPLE AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT
gxoXqMWJ8dY_12 0 SO WE'VE GOT F F SHARP AND F NATURAL BECAUSE ALL OF THIS IS ALREADY CONFUSING ENOUGH
gxoXqMWJ8dY_13 0 HOPEFULLY THIS MAKES MORE SENSE
gxoXqMWJ8dY_14 0 THIS EXPLAINS FLATS AND SHARPS AND NATURALS
gfZGAL2ZRDU_1 0 NOW AFTER WE'VE REMOVED EVERYTHING OF THE EXISTING DOORKNOB WE HAVE A CLEAN FRESH HOLE TO START WITH
gfZGAL2ZRDU_2 0 IT'S TIME TO INSTALL OUR NEW DOORKNOB
gfZGAL2ZRDU_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO START BY INSTALLING THE LATCH BOLT AND STRIKE PLATE WHICH IS USUALLY ATTACHED LIKE THIS
gfZGAL2ZRDU_4 0 AND AGAIN MAKE SURE THE SLOPE OF THE LATCH BOLT IS FACING THE DOOR JAMB
gfZGAL2ZRDU_5 0 AND YOU'LL FIRST JUST THREAD IN YOUR HARDWARE YOUR SCREWS BOLTS INTO THE HOLES
gfZGAL2ZRDU_6 0 THEN SET YOUR ELECTRIC DRILL TO TIGHTEN IF YOU HAVE ONE
gfZGAL2ZRDU_7 0 OR YOU COULD JUST BE USING YOUR NORMAL DRILL BUT THIS IS THE EASIER WAY TO DO IT
gfZGAL2ZRDU_8 0 AND QUICKLY GIVE THE GIVE IT A SHOT
gfZGAL2ZRDU_9 0 MAKE SURE IT'S IN NICE AND TIGHT
gfZGAL2ZRDU_10 0 AND AFTER YOU HAVE YOUR LATCH BOLT AND STRIKE PLATE SECURED YOU'RE READY TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STEP

H4HqbGU6S2M_3 0 SO FOR YOUR INTERVALS ONE THING YOU CAN DO ONE THING WE DO IN CROSS-COUNTRY PRACTICE IS MEASURE A SECTION OF TRAIL
H4HqbGU6S2M_4 0 AND IN ALL YOUR RUNNING YOU NEED TO BE A WATCH NERD AND RECORD YOUR TIMES FOR DIFFERENT INTERVALS
H4HqbGU6S2M_5 0 AND YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW YOUR MILE PACE AND THINGS AND BASE THINGS OFF THAT
H4HqbGU6S2M_6 0 BUT IF YOU CAN MARK OFF A SECTION OF TRAIL OR REEL IT OFF WHETHER IT'S 800 METERS OF A MILE AND DO YOUR REPEATS THERE
H4HqbGU6S2M_7 0 OR TAILOR THEM TO THE KIND OF THINGS THAT YOU'LL FACE IN YOUR OFF-ROAD TRIATHLON WHETHER IT'S LONG CLIMBS OR DIFFICULT ROOTED RUTTED SECTIONS
H4HqbGU6S2M_8 0 THOSE SORTS OF THINGS
H4HqbGU6S2M_9 0 SO MAKE IT SPECIFIC TO THE DEMANDS OF YOUR EVENT BY GETTING ON THE TRAIL
H4HqbGU6S2M_10 0 AND THERE'S A LOT OF EXCELLENT EVENTS THAT YOU CAN GET TO

HELXlVxEz9A_1 0 CLANCY ROSE ALL RIGHT
HELXlVxEz9A_2 0 SO IN THE NEXT STEP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS STEAMING THE MILK FOR YOUR DOUBLE VANILLA LATTE
HELXlVxEz9A_3 0 NOW I'LL POUR THE MILK INTO THE MILK STEAMING PITCHER HERE AND FOR I'M GOING TO BE USING A 14-OUNCE CUP
HELXlVxEz9A_4 0 SO WHEN I'M DOING THAT I'LL POUR THE COFFEE RIGHT UP TO THE RIDGE HERE IN THE PITCHER
HELXlVxEz9A_5 0 AND YOU'LL SEE HOW MUCH MILK IS IN THERE
HELXlVxEz9A_6 0 NOW I'M GOING TO STEAM THE MILK FOR THE DOUBLE VANILLA LATTE
HELXlVxEz9A_7 0 I'M GOING TO DO THIS IN THREE MOTIONS AND SO THE FIRST IS POSITIONING THE STEAMING PITCHER AT AN ANGLE
HELXlVxEz9A_8 0 SO THAT WHEN I TURN IT ON THE MILK STARTS SWIRLING AROUND IN THE INSIDE OF THE PITCHER
HELXlVxEz9A_9 0 I DO THAT UNTIL THE MILK REACHES ABOUT THE TEMPERATURE OF MY HAND
HELXlVxEz9A_10 0 THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED DEGREES AND THEN I'M GOING TO DROP IT DOWN AND DROP IT DOWN SO THAT THE TIP OF THE STEAM WAND IS JUST ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE MILK AND THAT'S GOING TO START INTRODUCING AIR INTO THE MILK AND IT'S CREATING FOAM
HELXlVxEz9A_11 0 YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HEAR THE DIFFERENCE THERE
HELXlVxEz9A_12 0 I'M GOING TO DO THAT FOR ABOUT FIVE OR SIX SECONDS FOR A LATTE THEN I'M GOING TO SUBMERGE THE STEAM WAND AGAIN INTO THE MILK AND GET IT SWIRLING AGAIN UNTIL AND KEEP IT SWIRLING UNTIL IT REACHES THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE
gWP6aOU-0wU_1 0 HI THIS IS RICH BUCCOLA HERE IN NEW YORK CITY AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE SOME GARLIC BREAD

GcIfvcCPE4U_1 0 WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT CANCER
GcIfvcCPE4U_2 0 CANCER AND PISCES ARE ALMOST WELL NOT THE SAME BUT THEY CARRY ALMOST THE SAME CHARACTERISTICS IN RELATIONSHIPS
GcIfvcCPE4U_3 0 CANCER PEOPLE ARE ALSO COMPATIBLE WITH ALL THE SIGNS
GcIfvcCPE4U_4 0 THERE ARE SOME SIGNS FOR EXAMPLE A LEO WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TOLERATE THE MOODINESS OF A CANCER FOR TOO LONG
GcIfvcCPE4U_5 0 CANCERS IF THEY FEEL REJECTED OR HURT WILL LOCK THEMSELVES AWAY INSIDE THE HOUSE FOR QUITE SOMETIME IN THE HOUSE BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THEY ARE COMFORTABLE
GcIfvcCPE4U_6 0 THINK ABOUT THE SHELL ON THE BACK OF THE CRAB
GcIfvcCPE4U_7 0 THAT DRIVES A LEO PERSON CRAZY BECAUSE A LEO IS OUT THERE
GcIfvcCPE4U_8 0 THEY ARE GREGARIOUS
GcIfvcCPE4U_9 0 THEY ARE OUT THERE
GcIfvcCPE4U_10 0 THEY ARE THERE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
GcIfvcCPE4U_11 0 THEY DON'T LINGER IN THE PAST
GcIfvcCPE4U_12 0 EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE SOME SINCE OF INSECURITY THEY DON'T RELY ON THEIR INSECURITIES
GcIfvcCPE4U_13 0 THEY DON'T LIKE FOR PEOPLE TO AFFECT THEM
GcIfvcCPE4U_14 0 THEY CHANGE THAT WITH THEIR BASIC SKILLS THEIR REGALITY
GcIfvcCPE4U_15 0 A CANCER AND A LEO CAN WORK WELL BECAUSE IF THE LEO PERSON BECOMES MORE COMPASSIONATE TO THE CANCER AND LEARNS TO PROTECT THOSE TRAITS WITHIN THE CANCER AND KNOWS THAT THERE WILL BE A WITHDRAWAL
GcIfvcCPE4U_16 0 FOR INSTANCE THEY ARE WITH THIS CANCER MATE AND SOMEONE INSULTS THE CANCER MATE WILL RETREAT AND THAT IS THAT
GcIfvcCPE4U_17 0 THIS WILL HAVE TO BE ACCEPTED AND IF THE LEO CAN ACCEPT IT THEN IT'S FINE
GcIfvcCPE4U_18 0 CANCERS ARE VERY SENSITIVE LOVERS
GcIfvcCPE4U_19 0 THEY LOVE THE HOME
GcIfvcCPE4U_20 0 THEY WILL HAVE THE COVERS THAT ARE SOFT AND FEEL NICE LIKE VELOUR OR YOU KNOW THAT NICE FABRIC
GcIfvcCPE4U_21 0 THEY WILL HAVE THE FLUFFY PILLOWS OR THAT FAVORITE PILLOW
GcIfvcCPE4U_22 0 THE HOME AND THE BEDROOM ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM
GcIfvcCPE4U_23 0 IT IS A VERY COZY AND WARM ENVIRONMENT
GcIfvcCPE4U_24 0 THEY ARE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE SO THEY ARE SENSITIVE TO THEIR COMPANIONS EMOTIONS AND THEIR NEEDS
GcIfvcCPE4U_25 0 THE CANCER WOULD GET ALONG WITH THE LEO BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY CARING PEOPLE AND WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE LEO
GcIfvcCPE4U_26 0 ITS JUST HOW THE LEO WOULD FEEL ABOUT THE CANCER
GcIfvcCPE4U_27 0 IN ALL ACTUALITY THE LEO JUST NEEDS TO LOOK AT THESE CHARACTERISTICS AND SAY OKAY I JUST NEED TO ACCEPT THAT I CANNOT CHANGE THAT IN THE CANCER PERSON
GcIfvcCPE4U_28 0 I JUST NEED TO LET ACCEPT THAT AND LET THEM DO WHAT COMES NATURALLY
GcIfvcCPE4U_29 0 FOR INSTANCE TO STAY AT HOME MORE TO LET THE HOME BECOME A HOME BASE AND LET EVERYTHING COME OUT FROM THE HOME
GcIfvcCPE4U_30 0 A HOME IS VERY IMPORTANT TO A CANCER
GcIfvcCPE4U_31 0 THERE LOVEMAKING TEND TO SHOW A LOT MORE CONSIDERATION A LOT MORE CARING A LOT MORE PASSION A LOT MORE NURTURING
GcIfvcCPE4U_32 0 SINCE THEY ARE SO SENSITIVE THEIR SENSES THEIR TONGUE THEIR HANDS THEY USE EVERYTHING ALL FIVE SENSES IN LOVEMAKING
GcIfvcCPE4U_33 0 THEY TEND TO GO LONGER ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE IN A NICE WARM ENVIRONMENT
GcIfvcCPE4U_34 0 IF YOU HAVE A CANCER LOVER I WOULD SUGGEST YOU MAKE IT A NICE HOME ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE CANCER TEND TO STICK AROUND AND USUALLY HAVE MORE LOVE MAKING
GcIfvcCPE4U_35 0 DON'T EXPECT A CANCER TO MAKE LOVE ON A ROOF TOP WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE COULD WATCH BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT BE IN A CANCER'S NATURE
GcIfvcCPE4U_36 0 HOWEVER IT WOULD BE IN A LEO'S NATURE

gjwN7jwh9q8_4 0 I NEED TO KNOW WHAT PARTS ARE THERE SO I CAN DISCUSS AND DECIDE WHICH ONES ARE MOST IMPORTANT IN THE FIT TO ME

glM_wMA8h9U_17 0 IT IS BASICALLY A LITTER BOX THAT IS FITTED INTO THE TOILET AND THE IDEA IS THAT YOU START WITH NO HOLE GET THE CAT USED TO SORT OF PERCHING ITS PAWS ON THE SEAT AND POOPING INTO THE LITTER BOX AND IT CAN SCRATCH AROUND AND STUFF AND THEN THE VERY FIRST STEP IS TO OPEN UP THAT HOLE A LITTLE BIT SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THE WATER COME THROUGH AND THAT IS WHERE THE REAL DECISIVE MOMENT COMES
glM_wMA8h9U_18 0 YOUR CAT MAY BE LIKE THERE IS NO WAY I'M USING THAT AND THEN YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND GO BACK TO USING THE LITTER BOX
glM_wMA8h9U_19 0 YOU MAY ALSO WANT TO KEEP YOUR EYE OUT WHENEVER YOU SEE THE CAT USING THAT
glM_wMA8h9U_20 0 YOU MAY WANT TO GIVE IT A TREAT GIVE IT COPIOUS PRAISE
glM_wMA8h9U_21 0 IT IS KIND OF LIKE POTTY TRAINING A CHILD
glM_wMA8h9U_22 0 SO YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THAT LITTLE HOLE
glM_wMA8h9U_23 0 YOU WANT TO BE SURE THAT YOU ARE USING A LITTER THAT IS FLUSHABLE BECAUSE YOU WILL GET LITTER THAT FALLS THROUGH INTO THE WATER AND YOU DON'T WANT IT TO CLOG UP YOUR PLUMBING
glM_wMA8h9U_24 0 SO YOU HAVE YOUR FLUSHABLE LITTER
glM_wMA8h9U_25 0 YOU HAVE YOUR BASIN AND THEN YOU HAVE YOUR LITTLE HOLE
glM_wMA8h9U_26 0 IF YOUR CAT IS COMFORTABLE WITH THAT LITTLE HOLE WHICH IS A BIG STOPPING POINT FOR A LOT OF CATS THEN YOU CAN START MAKING THE HOLE A LITTLE BIGGER A LITTLE BIGGER A LITTLE BIGGER AND BASICALLY THE IDEA IS AND YOU CAN USE A LITTLE PICK UP SOMETHING AT THE HARDWARE STORE TO LINE THE INSIDE OF THE HOLE SO THE LITTER DOESN'T FALL RIGHT THROUGH BUT AS IT GETS BIGGER AND BIGGER THE GOAL IS TO GET IT BIG ENOUGH SO THAT THERE IS JUST A LITTLE BIT OF LITTER ON THE OUTSIDE AND THEN THERE IS NO LITTER AT ALL
glM_wMA8h9U_27 0 THE CAT IS JUST PERCHED ON THE TOILET AND POOPING RIGHT INTO THE TOILET
HBMiHY81vnM_1 0 CLANCY ROSE HELLO I AM CLANCY ROSE FROM CAFFE MEDICI IN AUSTIN TEXAS AND I AM HERE TODAY WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT MAKING A DOUBLE SHOT LATTE
HBMiHY81vnM_2 0 FIRST I AM GOING TO GO OVER EVERYTHING THAT YOU ARE GOING TO NEED FOR THE PROCESS
HBMiHY81vnM_3 0 I LIKE TO HAVE ABOUT THREE OR FOUR CLEAN DRY TOWELS TO CLEAN UP THE SURFACE WHILE YOU ARE WHILE YOU ARE MAKING THE DRINK
HBMiHY81vnM_4 0 YOU GOT YOUR ESPRESSO GRINDER RIGHT HERE AND OF COURSE THE BEANS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO USE FOR THE ESPRESSO FOR THE DRINK
HBMiHY81vnM_5 0 THEN OF COURSE YOU HAVE YOUR HOME ESPRESSO MACHINE RIGHT HERE WHICH COMES WITH THE PORTER FILTER THE STEAM WAND
HBMiHY81vnM_6 0 I HAVE ANOTHER WET TOWEL UP HERE TO WIPE OFF THE STEAM WAND LATER
HBMiHY81vnM_7 0 I HAVE THE FOURTEEN OUNCE LATTE CUPS AND A TAMPER ESPRESSO TAMPER WHICH GOES INTO THE PREPARATION OF THE ESPRESSO
HBMiHY81vnM_8 0 A COUPLE MORE TOWELS OVER HERE THEN I HAVE A THERMOMETER TO CHECK THE TEMPERATURE OF THE MILK AFTER YOU STEAMED IT FOR THE LATTE
HBMiHY81vnM_9 0 WE HAVE A MILK STEAMING PITCHER 28 OUNCE MILK STEAMING PITCHER AND THEN YOUR MILK
heRDkIYxyDs_1 0 DID YOU KNOW THAT EVEN PROGRAMS MADE FOR WINDOWS 2000 WILL RUN ON VISTA
heRDkIYxyDs_2 0 HI I'M DAN AFONSO WITH AFONSO CONSULTING AND ENFOLD IT AND THIS IS HOW TO RUN OLD PROGRAMS IN VISTA
heRDkIYxyDs_3 0 NOW VISTA HANDLES A LOT OF THE COMPATIBILITY WORK BEHIND THE SCENES
heRDkIYxyDs_4 0 YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO SEE IT IT JUST KIND OF WORKS BUT THERE ARE GOING TO BE PROBLEMS WHEN THE PROGRAM NEEDS VERY SPECIFIC FEATURES WITH VERY SPECIFIC OPERATING SYSTEMS OR REQUIRED ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS
heRDkIYxyDs_5 0 A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THAT MOST VIDEO GAMES GENERALLY ASSUME THAT THEY HAVE FULL REIGN OF THE MACHINE AND GENERALLY THAT IS NOT ACTUALLY A BAD ASSUMPTION BUT IT IS ANNOYING ON VISTA BECAUSE VISTA INSTEAD OF SIMPLY ALLOWING THIS WILL TYPICALLY POP UP WARNINGS SO IN ORDER TO TRY IT OUT FIRST THING WE ARE GOING TO BRING UP SOMETHING
heRDkIYxyDs_6 0 I'M GOING TO JUST GRAB A GAME HERE AND IF YOU JUST WANT TO SEE THAT A GAME WASN'T WORKING OR ANY PROGRAM REALLY WASN'T WORKING BEFORE TRY IT OUT AND JUST RIGHT CLICK ON IT AND RUN IT AS ADMINISTRATOR AND OBVIOUSLY I AM ASSUMING YOU HAVE FULL CONTROL OF THE MACHINE AND THE ADMINISTRATOR PASSWORD
heRDkIYxyDs_7 0 WHEN YOU RUN IT LIKE THIS IT WILL GO IN AND RUN IT UNDER FULL PRIVILEGE MODE AND THAT FIXES THE ISSUE AND WHAT YOU NOW NEED TO DO IS TO RIGHT CLICK ON IT CLICK ON PROPERTIES GO OVER TO COMPATIBILITY AND CHECK OFF RUN THIS PROGRAM AS ADMINISTRATOR
heRDkIYxyDs_8 0 THIS WILL ALWAYS MAKE IT START UP BY DEFAULT AS AN ADMINISTRATOR
heRDkIYxyDs_9 0 AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS WHEN YOU DO IT IT WILL POP UP A WARNING EVERY TIME YOU TRY TO START THE APPLICATION
heRDkIYxyDs_10 0 ANOTHER OPTION YOU HAVE IS IF IT REQUIRES CERTAIN FEATURES BUGS OR QUIRKS OF A CERTAIN OPERATING SYSTEM THERE IS AN OPTION UNDER MOST OF THESE UNDER COMPATIBILITY TO RUN IT IN COMPATIBILITY MODE FOR WHATEVER APPLICATION YOU WANT
heRDkIYxyDs_11 0 YOU CAN EVEN GO BACK AS FAR AS NT4.0 AS YOUR COMPATIBILITY VERSION ALLOWING YOU TO GET SOME REALLY OLD CRANKY APPLICATIONS TO RUN UNDER VISTA
heRDkIYxyDs_12 0 I'M DAN AFONSO AND THIS HAS BEEN HOW TO RUN OLDER APPLICATIONS UNDER VISTA
GmtYoI1oI00_1 0 THIS IS THE SUZY
GmtYoI1oI00_2 0 IT BLOWS AIR ON THE GARMENTS
GmtYoI1oI00_3 0 I USE IT ON HEAVY SWEATERS SOME TYPE OF SWEATSHIRTS IT DEPENDS
GmtYoI1oI00_4 0 IF IT IS WOOL OR A SWEATSHIRT GARMENT THAT WON'T STRETCH WE CAN PUT IT ON THE SUZY
GmtYoI1oI00_5 0 NOW THIS IS ALSO USED FOR SUITS AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF JACKETS
GmtYoI1oI00_6 0 I PUT THIS ON SO IT STAYS THERE AND THEN I TURN ON THE SUZY AND SHE BLOWS AIR ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT AND THE ARMS COME OUT AND EVERYTHING
GmtYoI1oI00_7 0 THERE IS A CYCLE TO THAT AND IT WILL TURN DOWN AND THEN IT WILL TURN DOWN AND IT WILL SOFTEN OUT
GmtYoI1oI00_8 0 IT WILL BLOW STEAM THROUGH IT
GmtYoI1oI00_9 0 ON A WOOL OR A HEAVIER KNIT GARMENT COULD BE A SWEATSHIRT OR SOMETHING IF YOU WANTED YOU COLD YOU COULD PUT IT ON A SUZY
GmtYoI1oI00_10 0 THIS IS A SUZY SO NAMED IN DRY CLEANING I DON'T KNOW THE REASON WHY
GmtYoI1oI00_11 0 YOU THEN WOULD PUT THIS ON THIS JUST TO MAKE SURE IT IS HELD FIRMLY AND IT BLOWS STEAM
GmtYoI1oI00_12 0 I THINK THAT IS ENOUGH STEAM FOR NOW
gd86ZcveJQY_1 0 HEY WELCOME BACK
gd86ZcveJQY_2 0 THIS IS GLEN CORNISH WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
gd86ZcveJQY_3 0 WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT HOW TO MAKE YOUR VIDEOS LOOK PROFESSIONAL
gd86ZcveJQY_4 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT LIGHTING
gd86ZcveJQY_5 0 LET ME SAY SOMETHING ABOUT DIGITAL VIDEO IN GENERAL
gd86ZcveJQY_6 0 IT IS VERY VERY CRUCIAL THAT YOU PAY ATTENTION TO LIGHTING
gd86ZcveJQY_7 0 ESPECIALLY LOW LIGHT LEVELS
gd86ZcveJQY_8 0 THEY DON'T DO VERY WELL
gd86ZcveJQY_9 0 EVEN SOME OF THE THINGS YOU'VE SEEN IN THEATERS SOME OF THESE DIGITAL MOVIES ESPECIALLY STAR WARS WHICH WAS ONE OF THE FIRST DIGITAL MOVIES SHOT IN ALL DIGITAL FORMAT THEY STILL IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH LIGHTING
gd86ZcveJQY_10 0 I THINK I MENTIONED BEFORE WHEN YOU HAVE DARK LEVELS OF BLACK AND GRAYS IT MAKES THE CAMERA WORK HARDER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT'S SEEING
gd86ZcveJQY_11 0 KEEP A REALLY REALLY CLOSE LOOK AT YOUR LIGHTING AND YOUR EXPOSURE LEVELS
gd86ZcveJQY_12 0 THAT MEANS YES YOU'LL HAVE TO INVEST IN A LIGHTING KIT OF SOME SORTS IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY
gd86ZcveJQY_13 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY
gd86ZcveJQY_14 0 I HAVE TWO LIGHTS HERE I'VE HAD FOREVER
gd86ZcveJQY_15 0 IT ONLY COST ME A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS
gd86ZcveJQY_16 0 BASICALLY YOU CAN CHOOSE WHATEVER KIND OF LIGHTS YOU WANT
gd86ZcveJQY_17 0 THESE ARE THE MOST BASIC WITH WHAT THEY CALL BARN DOORS HERE AND THAT IS JUST SO THAT YOU CAN CONTROL SOME OF THE LIGHT IN CERTAIN AREAS
gd86ZcveJQY_18 0 OBVIOUSLY WIDER MEANS A WIDER BRIGHT LIGHT AND THEN YOU CAN NARROW IT DOWN
gd86ZcveJQY_19 0 THERE'S ALSO YOU HAVE THE UMBRELLA HERE
gd86ZcveJQY_20 0 THAT'S PERFECT FOR DIFFUSED LIGHTING
gd86ZcveJQY_21 0 OTHER WORDS IF YOU'RE SHOOTING SOMEBODY YOU NEVER POINT THE LIGHT DIRECTLY AT THEM
gd86ZcveJQY_22 0 YOU USUALLY POINT IT UP BUT IF YOU WANT SOFT SO IT'S NOT SO HARD THE SHADOWS AREN'T HARD YOU SHOULD AVOID SHADOWS ANYWAY BUT TO SOFTEN EVERYTHING YOU USE UMBRELLAS
gd86ZcveJQY_23 0 ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO DO WHEN YOU'RE SHOOTING INDOORS IS TO USE A SINGLE LIGHT IF IT'S SUPER BRIGHT AND JUST SIMPLY POINT IT BOUNCE THE LIGHT OFF THE CEILING
gd86ZcveJQY_24 0 THAT'S HOW I'M BEING TAPED RIGHT NOW
gd86ZcveJQY_25 0 IS A SINGLE LIGHT THAT IS POINTED UP AT THE CEILING AND THAT DIFFUSES THE LIGHT BECAUSE THE CEILING IS WHITE AND GIVES IT A NICE GLOW
gd86ZcveJQY_26 0 IF YOU CAN DO IT WITH ONE LIGHT GREAT BUT TWO LIGHTS IS BETTER AND REALLY NICE PROFESSIONAL QUALITY YOU USE THREE LIGHTS
gd86ZcveJQY_27 0 YOU USE ONE AS THE MAIN THE FILL AND SOMETIMES A SPOT
gd86ZcveJQY_28 0 BASICALLY THAT'S IT WITH LIGHTING BUT THERE'S ONE OTHER ISSUE
gd86ZcveJQY_29 0 IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD THESE THAT'S OK
gd86ZcveJQY_30 0 I WOULD STILL ADVISE YOU TO INVEST IN SOME KIND OF LIGHTING
gd86ZcveJQY_31 0 MAYBE YOU CAN BUY THE KIND OF LIGHT THAT SITS ON TOP OF YOUR CAMCORDER IN YOUR SHOE AND YOU CAN MOUNT IT THERE
gd86ZcveJQY_32 0 ALWAYS PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR LIGHTING
gd86ZcveJQY_33 0 YOU CAN BUY A LIGHT THAT GOES ON TOP OF YOUR CAMERA IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD LIGHTS LIKE THIS THAT FITS IN THE SHOE
gd86ZcveJQY_34 0 PAY ATTENTION TO THE LIGHTING CAUSE IT'S THE MOST CRUCIAL PART OF DIGITAL VIDEO
gd86ZcveJQY_35 0 NEXT LETS LOOK AT HOW ALL THIS WORKS WITH YOUR COMPUTER
HjPS59Erxgw_1 0 I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT VALUES OF THE ORNAMENTS THAT I HAVE
HjPS59Erxgw_2 0 LIKE I SAID BEFORE IF YOU GET A REFERENCE BOOK YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH THESE ORNAMENTS ARE WORTH THIS YEAR
HjPS59Erxgw_3 0 AND PRICES ARE GOING TO VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR
HjPS59Erxgw_4 0 SOME WILL INCREASE SOME WILL DECREASE
HjPS59Erxgw_5 0 BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY THESE ORNAMENTS ON A SECONDARY MARKET OR USED ON THE YEAR IT WASN'T PUT OUT IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO USE THIS AS A BASE WHEN YOU BUY YOUR ORNAMENTS
HjPS59Erxgw_6 0 IF YOU GO ON EBAY YOU CAN FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH IT'S WORTH AND YOU CAN COMPARE THAT TO WHAT PRICE THAT THEY'RE ASKING
HjPS59Erxgw_7 0 SOME OF THESE EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THE BEST INCREASE IN VALUE IS THE 1973 BETSY CLARK FIRST SERIES
HjPS59Erxgw_8 0 THAT SOLD FOR TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS NEW
HjPS59Erxgw_9 0 IT'S NOW WORTH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS
HjPS59Erxgw_10 0 THIS ONE WHICH IS THE VERY FIRST FROSTY FRIENDS ORNAMENT SOLD FOR SIX DOLLARS THE YEAR THAT IT WAS RELEASED
HjPS59Erxgw_11 0 IT IS NOW WORTH SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS AND THE FIRST THREE HOUSES OF THE NOSTALGIC SERIES THOSE THREE HOUSES TOGETHER ARE WORTH SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE DOLLARS
gDGrAAY42rE_1 0 YOU WILL PROBABLY FIND YOURSELF ENCOUNTERING SOME FRUSTRATION IN THIS PRACTICE
gDGrAAY42rE_2 0 THIS ISN'T GOING VERY WELL SORRY OKAY BUT THERE YOU GO THERE'S A PERFECT CIRCLE
gDGrAAY42rE_3 0 AND WITH THE USE OF THE DIVIDER OTHER THINGS CAN HAPPEN LIKE LETS SAY I WANT TO DO THIS SO NOW YOU KNOW WHERE YOU WANT TO GO WITH THAT AND YOU CAN MARK THAT
gDGrAAY42rE_4 0 ANYWAY A DIVIDER COMES IN HANDY WHEN YOU'RE FIGURING OUT HOW TO MAKE YOUR CIRCLES WHAT SIZE WHAT PROPORTION AND SO ON
gDGrAAY42rE_5 0 YOU SEE HOW I CLEANED THIS
gDGrAAY42rE_6 0 ANOTHER WAY TO CLEAN THINGS YOU CAN DO THIS WITH THE PENS AS WELL IS TO JUST TAKE A PIECE OF PAPER AND GO LIKE THIS OF COURSE I CAN OPEN THIS UP A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT THAT'S HOW YOU WOULD CLEAN THE INSIDE ALSO WITH THOSE SPEED BALL PENS
gDGrAAY42rE_7 0 AND ANOTHER THING I SHOULD MENTIONED AS I THINK ABOUT IT IS YOU SEE HOW THIS LITTLE JAR AND THIS IS ACTUALLY ALCOHOL SO I CAN USE THIS SOMETIMES TO CLEAN OFF MY PENS JUST HELPS MAYBE TO DO THIS ONCE IN A WHILE INSTEAD OF USING PLAIN OLD WATER
gDGrAAY42rE_8 0 AND I ALSO USE TISSUES FOR CLEANING THINGS LIKE THIS PEN RIGHT HERE DIP IT IN WATER OR ALCOHOL AND THEN I'LL USE A TISSUE TO CLEAN IT OFF
gDGrAAY42rE_9 0 SO YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU REALLY KEEP YOUR TOOLS CLEAN
HAjRnO19Pds_1 0 CHAD BASTIAN HI THIS IS CHAD BASTIAN WELCOME TO EXPERT VILLAGE
HAjRnO19Pds_2 0 WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE TRIKE BUGGY AND PPG TRIKING WITH PARAGLIDERS
HAjRnO19Pds_3 0 OKAY IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS A POWER ON LANDING
HAjRnO19Pds_4 0 SO THIS TIME WE POSITION OURSELVES WITHIN GLIDE OF THE LANDING FIELD MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE FURTHER AHEAD OF US SO WE HAVE ROOM TO ADD POWER
HAjRnO19Pds_5 0 COME OFF TO IDLE AND GLIDE DOWN FROM A HUNDRED FEET DOWN TO MAYBE TWENTY FEET AND THEN WE ADD THROTTLE AND START LEVELING IT OUT
HAjRnO19Pds_6 0 BY TEN FEET WE WANT TO LEVEL THE GLIDER A LEVEL THE TRIKE OUT AND JUST TAKE THE LAST TEN FEET USING THE THROTTLE
HAjRnO19Pds_8 0 KEEPING OUR BRAKES HIGH USING A THROTTLE TO SLOW OUR DESCENT RATE
HAjRnO19Pds_9 0 AND AS SOON AS OUR REAR WHEELS TOUCH THE GROUND YOU WANT TO LET OFF ON THE THROTTLE AND GO AHEAD AND KILL THE MOTOR AS WE BRING HANDS SLOWLY AND PROGRESSIVELY DOWN AND INTO THE LANDING
HAjRnO19Pds_10 0 THE OTHER THING WE CAN DO WITH A POWER LANDING IS AS SOON AS WE LAND WE MAY USE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BRAKE A LITTLE COMBINATION OF BRAKE AND THROTTLE
HAjRnO19Pds_11 0 AS SOON AS WE'RE ON THE GROUND WE CAN GO SHIFT OUR EYES FROM LOOKING AT THE HORIZON IN THE RUNWAY TO OUR MIRROR FOCUS ON TAXING ALONG WITH THAT WING
HAjRnO19Pds_12 0 IF IT'S BALANCED AND STABLE WE CAN GO RIGHT BACK INTO ANOTHER LAUNCH
HAjRnO19Pds_13 0 SO WE CAN DO THESE TOUCH AND GO PRACTICE RUNS A REALLY GOOD EXERCISE FOR THAT
HAjRnO19Pds_14 0 SO THE BEST LANDING IS REALLY A COMBINATION OF SOME POWER AND A LITTLE BIT OF FLAIR AND WE CAN HAVE OUR MOST PERFECT TOUCHDOWN LANDINGS IN THE TRIKE BUGGY
HAjRnO19Pds_15 0 MAKE IT REALLY FUN AND PLEASURABLE TO FLY
gynGfsfibXc_1 0 HOW DO YOU PERM EYELASHES

gynGfsfibXc_5 0 DO YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANT TO HAVE THEIR EYELASHES PERMED AND THE PROCESS IS VERY SIMILAR TO PERMING ONE'S HAIR
gynGfsfibXc_6 0 I DO HIGHLY RECOMMEND THOUGH THAT YOU GO TO A PROFESSIONAL SALON TO HAVE THIS DONE AS IT IS YOUR EYES AND YOUR EYES ARE VERY PRECIOUS TO US
gynGfsfibXc_7 0 NOW ONCE YOU GET AND FIND A SALON MEET WITH THAT PERSON INITIALLY THAT IS GOING TO BE DOING THE PROCEDURE OF PERMING YOUR EYELASHES
gynGfsfibXc_8 0 MAKE SURE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND THAT THEY HAVE THE PROPER CREDENTIALS AND ONCE YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH THAT HAVE THEM RUN A TEST TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT ALLERGIC TO THE SOLUTION BECAUSE THEY USE THE SAME SOLUTIONS IN PERMING YOUR EYELASHES AS THEY DO YOUR HAIR
gynGfsfibXc_9 0 SO ONCE YOU HAVE SET UP THAT APPOINTMENT AND YOU GET THERE AND YOU KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT BECAUSE THEY HAVE EXPLAINED THAT TO YOU PRIOR TO YOUR APPOINTMENT YOU WILL BE SETTING IN A CHAIR AND THEY WILL PREPARE THE EYE AND PROTECT THE EYE AREA
gynGfsfibXc_10 0 THEY WILL HAVE YOU CLOSE YOUR EYE AND THEY WILL LAY USUALLY SOME TYPE OF PAID UNDER THERE LIKE A COTTON PAD ON THE EYE BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO BE USING A PERMING SOLUTION ON YOUR EYELASHES
gynGfsfibXc_11 0 ONCE THEY GET YOUR EYELASH AND AREA PREPARED AND CLEAN HAVE YOUR WHOLE AREA COMPLETELY LEAN THEY WILL TAKE LITTLE ROLLERS LIKE THEY DO PERMING YOUR HAIR AND THEY WOULD ROLL THAT AROUND THE EYELASH APPLY THIS PERMING SOLUTION WAIT FIFTEEN MINUTES WASH IT OFF AND VUALA YOU HAVE YOUR PERMANENTLY EYELASHES PERMED

g_UQ1Ho2OcM_1 0 JASON SHERIDAN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS JASON SHERIDAN FROM THE SHERIDAN FENCING ACADEMY HERE IN NEW YORK CITY AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO DEMONSTRATE SOME INTERMEDIATE SABRE FENCING
g_UQ1Ho2OcM_2 0 ANOTHER OPTION FOR PROTECTING YOURSELF WITH YOUR LEGS IS A DOUBLE RETREAT
g_UQ1Ho2OcM_3 0 WE JUST WENT OVER JUMPING BACK WHICH IS EXCELLENT FOR PROTECTING OURSELVES IN VERY CLOSE DISTANCE AND VERY QUICKLY
g_UQ1Ho2OcM_4 0 BUT SOMETIMES WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT THE DISTANCE OF OUR OPPONENT'S ATTACK WILL BE OR WE JUST NEED MORE DISTANCE TO PROTECT OURSELVES IN THAT CASE WE USE TOO QUICK BUT SHORT RETREATS TO AVOID OUR OPPONENT'S ATTACK
g_UQ1Ho2OcM_6 0 DON'T START TOO CLOSE GIRLS
g_UQ1Ho2OcM_7 0 TOO QUICK BUT SHORT RETREATS
g_UQ1Ho2OcM_9 0 THEY CAN EVEN MAKE A SLIGHTLY LONGER LUNGE THIS TIME BECAUSE THE DEFENSIVE AREA IS LONGER
g_UQ1Ho2OcM_11 0 TOO QUICK BUT SHORT RETREATS
g_UQ1Ho2OcM_12 0 THE ADVANTAGE HERE IS THEY HAVE MORE AREA TO PROTECT THEMSELVES
g_UQ1Ho2OcM_13 0 THE DISADVANTAGE IS THAT WHEN THEY DECIDE TO MAKE THEIR OWN ATTACK THEY'RE GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT FARTHER SO EACH HAS AN ADVANTAGE AND A DISADVANTAGE
GCfSCb_zhu0_1 0 LASZLO HUVE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS LASZLO HUVE HERE IN NEW YORK CITY CAMP UNDEFEATED
GCfSCb_zhu0_2 0 TODAY WE'LL TRY TO BREAK A BOARD
GCfSCb_zhu0_3 0 OUR NEXT BREAK IS AN ADVANCED BREAK
GCfSCb_zhu0_4 0 USUALLY COLORED BELTS OR BLACK BELTS THEY'RE TRYING OUT THE SUSPENDED BOARD BREAK
GCfSCb_zhu0_5 0 THE MAIN IDEA THAT YOUR OPPONENT HOLDS THE BOARD IN THE AIR MIDAIR WITH TWO FINGERS
GCfSCb_zhu0_6 0 YOUR SPEED HAS TO GO THROUGH THE BOARD AND BREAK THE BOARD
GCfSCb_zhu0_7 0 IT'S NOT ABOUT POWER IT'S ABOUT TECHNIQUE
GCfSCb_zhu0_8 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BODY IS LINED UP PROPERLY
GCfSCb_zhu0_9 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR SHOULDER IS IN THE SAME LINE WITH THE MIDDLE OF THE BOARD THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO HIT
GCfSCb_zhu0_10 0 BECAUSE IN ADVANCED BREAK YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT INSTEAD OF PUSHING THE BOARD YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THE BOARD
GCfSCb_zhu0_11 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE HITTING IN THE MIDDLE MAKE SURE THAT THE GRAIN IS SUPPORTED IN THE RIGHT WAY
GCfSCb_zhu0_12 0 YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A SMOOTH CLEAN-CUT CONTACT
GCfSCb_zhu0_13 0 SO OUR BODY IS POSITIONED PROPERLY YOU'RE BREATHING OUT READY FOR THE BREAK GOING THROUGH
GCfSCb_zhu0_14 0 AND IF YOU RECAPTURE IT AGAIN IT'S ALL ABOUT SPEED GOING THROUGH THE BOARD BREAKING THE BOARD CLEAN HALFWAY THROUGH

GEv5ZCyDNrk_1 0 HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
GEv5ZCyDNrk_2 0 WHAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT NOW IS WHEN OUR DEFENSIVE GUY IS IN PURSUIT OF A TACKLE HE HAS TO COME UP AND CONTROL THIS OFFENSIVE LINEMAN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
GEv5ZCyDNrk_3 0 REMEMBER THE OFFENSE KNOWS WHERE THE PLAY IS GOING

GEv5ZCyDNrk_6 0 LET'S GO THAT FAR VIDEO DEMO
GEv5ZCyDNrk_7 0 HE HAS HIS HANDS EXTENDED
GEv5ZCyDNrk_8 0 NOW HE HAS TO KEEP HIS FEET WIDE
GEv5ZCyDNrk_9 0 YOU NEVER WANT THE DEFENSIVE GUYS BRING THEIR FEET TOGETHER
GEv5ZCyDNrk_10 0 IF THE OFFENSIVE GUY GETS A GOOD PUSH AND HE BRINGS HIS FEET TOGETHER HE'S GOING TO TRIP OVER HIMSELF AND HE'S GOING TO PUSH HIM OUT OF THE PLAY
GEv5ZCyDNrk_11 0 HE HAS TO TAKE A STEP AND THEN ANOTHER STEP
GEv5ZCyDNrk_12 0 I'LL SHOW YOU VIDEO DEMO
GEv5ZCyDNrk_13 0 HE HAS TO KEEP HIS FEET WIDE
GEv5ZCyDNrk_14 0 EVERY TIME HE TAKES A STEP HE HAS TO KEEP HIS FEET WIDE
GEv5ZCyDNrk_15 0 HE'S GOING TO TRY TO WALK HIMSELF AROUND IN PURSUIT OF THIS RUNNING BACK COMING ACROSS
GEv5ZCyDNrk_16 0 NOW THIS OFFENSIVE GUY IS ALSO GOING TO BE TRYING TO KEEP HIM OUT OF THE PLAY
GEv5ZCyDNrk_17 0 ONCE HE SHEDS THE TACKLE AND GETS WIDE THEN HE CAN START HIS PURSUIT OF THE RUNNING BACK
GEv5ZCyDNrk_18 0 THE MAIN THING IS TO KEEP YOUR FEET WIDE ENOUGH THAT YOU DON'T STEP ON YOUR OWN FEET OR TRIP OVER YOURSELF WHILE TRYING TO GET TO THE OUTSIDE OF THAT PLAY

gVxZfWqrog0_25 0 AND THE ROOK LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE CASTLE AND THE KNIGHT LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE HORSE
gVxZfWqrog0_26 0 THAT WOULD BE A STAUNTON
gVxZfWqrog0_27 0 BUT THEY'RE NOT AS FUN AS THE UNIQUE CHESS SETS
hg6SmPFyA-s_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS KAREN LOCASALE AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT GOURD ART
hg6SmPFyA-s_2 0 MAKING A SHADOWBOX GOURD SO THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO KNOW WHICH YOU ALREADY DO IS YOU'VE DECIDED YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS INTO A SHADOW BOX
hg6SmPFyA-s_3 0 SO WHEN YOU GO TO YOUR GOURD FARM THE ONE I GO TO IS NATURE'S FARM IN GILBERT YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR A PARTICULAR SHAPE AND SIZE OF GOURD
hg6SmPFyA-s_4 0 YOU DON'T WANT ONE OF THE ONES THAT'S TALL AND THIN THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK FOR YOU
hg6SmPFyA-s_5 0 SO YOU WANT SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THAN THIS ONE BUT YOU WANT THIS SHAPE BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING IS YOU'RE GOING TO BE CUTTING THIS AREA OUT TO ACTUALLY MAKE YOUR SHADOW BOX
hg6SmPFyA-s_6 0 AND AS FAR AS YOUR TOP YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT TALL AND SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU ENOUGH AREA HERE TO MAKE YOUR CUT AND STILL HAVE SOME PORTION OF YOUR GOURD HERE RATHER THAN HAVING IT COMPLETELY FLAT HERE AND YOU KNOW YOUR SHAPE IS NOT GOING TO LOOK RIGHT
hg6SmPFyA-s_7 0 SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW AND LOOK WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR SHAPE OF YOUR GOURD AT THE GOURD FARM
GI3mKlEwDr8_1 0 HELLO I'M SIFU MALLON WITH THE CLEARWATER KUNG FU CENTER
GI3mKlEwDr8_2 0 THIS IS MY ASSISTANT MELISSA AND THIS IS STANDING GRAPPLING
GI3mKlEwDr8_3 0 THE NEXT MOVE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING IS AN UPWARD HAND LOCK
GI3mKlEwDr8_4 0 SO THIS ONE IS AGAIN USING THE WRIST ACTION LIFTING THE HAND THIS WAY
GI3mKlEwDr8_5 0 SO THIS ONE WE'LL GO FROM A RIGHT HANDSHAKE LIKE THIS
GI3mKlEwDr8_7 0 SO THE HANDSHAKE IS JUST ONE WAY THAT WE GO AHEAD AND PRACTICE THE DRILL IT CAN BE DONE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS OKAY
GI3mKlEwDr8_8 0 IF YOU GET WRIST CONTROL HAND CONTROL
GI3mKlEwDr8_9 0 BUT WE'LL JUST GO FROM THE BASIC HAND LOCK
GI3mKlEwDr8_10 0 I'M GOING TO FLIP US AROUND THIS WAY SO YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE BIT THERE FOR ME
GI3mKlEwDr8_11 0 SO FROM THIS POSITION WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO USE THE WEDGE OF MY HAND AND I'M GOING TO HIT IT RIGHT INTO MELISSA'S WRIST BONE OKAY
GI3mKlEwDr8_12 0 RIGHT ON THE BEND OF IT
GI3mKlEwDr8_13 0 AS I DO THIS I'M GOING TO STEP IN WITH MY LEFT FOOT
GI3mKlEwDr8_14 0 I'M GOING TO CRADLE MY RIGHT ELBOW THROUGH MY BODY AND I'M GOING TO PULL THIS ARM BACK TOWARD MY SHOULDER
GI3mKlEwDr8_15 0 TWO THINGS HAPPEN HERE
GI3mKlEwDr8_16 0 ONE MY LEFT ARM COMES UNDERNEATH HER ELBOW LOCKING HER ELBOW INTO A STRAIGHTENING POSITION
GI3mKlEwDr8_18 0 SO THIS WAY I CAN GET HER TO COMPLY WITH WHAT I WANT
GI3mKlEwDr8_19 0 THE LOCK ITSELF IS NOT THE ELBOW BUT THE WRIST HERE
GI3mKlEwDr8_20 0 SO WHAT'S HAPPENING BASICALLY IS I'M TAKING THE HAND THEN I'M PUSHING THE HEEL OF MY HAND FORWARD AND PULLING THE FOUR FINGERS OF MY THUMB AND INDEX BACK THIS WAY OKAY AND LOCKING THE HAND
GI3mKlEwDr8_21 0 NOW WHAT HAPPENS USUALLY IF SOMEONE USUALLY MOVES WITH THIS SO AS I PERFORM THE MOVE JUST TAKE ONE STEP BACK MELISSA SO WHAT WE DO IS WE GO WITH THEM
GI3mKlEwDr8_23 0 ONE COMMON MISTAKE THAT PEOPLE DO AND THEY DO THIS IS IS THEY GO LIKE THIS AND WHEN THE PERSON GOES TO STEP BACK THEY GO LIKE THIS
GI3mKlEwDr8_25 0 SO THAT LEAVE THEM
GI3mKlEwDr8_26 0 WE WANT TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH THE PERSON
GI3mKlEwDr8_27 0 SO AS WE MOVE THEY MOVE
GI3mKlEwDr8_28 0 OKAY ONE LAST TIME WE GO NORMAL SPEED
GI3mKlEwDr8_29 0 BOOM AND THEN APPLY THE PRESSURE INWARD
GI3mKlEwDr8_30 0 THIS IS CALLED UPWARD HAND LOCK
_gXFdaJ6dR4_1 0 OK I'M TAKING AND RELEASING THE HALYARD FROM THE MAIN AND I'M GOING TO RUN IT TO THE BACK OF THE BOAT
_gXFdaJ6dR4_2 0 BACK TO THE BOAT
_gXFdaJ6dR4_3 0 I'LL SWITCH THIS TO YOU
_gXFdaJ6dR4_4 0 I'LL HAND YOU THIS ZIPPER ON THE SAIL COVER
_gXFdaJ6dR4_5 0 SO I'LL HAND THE HALYARD TO KELLY
_gXFdaJ6dR4_6 0 AND WE JUST CLIP IT ON TO THE VERY END
_gXFdaJ6dR4_7 0 AND THE REASON FOR DOING THIS IS TO HOLD THE HALYARD AWAY FROM THE MAST SO THAT IN WINDS YOU DON'T GET THAT SLAPPING OF THE HALYARD LINE ONTO THE MAST
_gXFdaJ6dR4_8 0 AND WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO LIVE ABOARD THEIR BOATS IN THIS MARINA AND IT'S PRETTY IRRITATING TO HEAR THAT SLAPPING OF THE LINE
_gXFdaJ6dR4_9 0 SO ALL THE LINES GET PULLED AWAY FROM THE MAST AS A COURTESY
gM0gs9Umw-Y_1 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO DO ANOTHER VARIATION OF THE SUPER FUN SUNSALUTE
gM0gs9Umw-Y_2 0 WHAT MAKES IT FUN IS CHALLENGING YOURSELF
gM0gs9Umw-Y_3 0 DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT
gM0gs9Umw-Y_4 0 THE MORE YOU FALL DOWN THE MORE I FALL DOWN THE MORE I TRUST MYSELF
gM0gs9Umw-Y_5 0 BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I FALL DOWN
gM0gs9Umw-Y_6 0 I GET UP
gM0gs9Umw-Y_7 0 AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF YOGA
gM0gs9Umw-Y_8 0 EXHALE ZERO INHALE ONE EXHALE TWO INHALE THREE HOLD FOUR LEFT LEG BACK PUT THE RIGHT SHOULDER UNDER THE RIGHT ARM TURN THE BACK HEEL DOWN FIND THE SKINNIEST PART OF YOUR WAIST LEFT ARM BEHIND WALK THE BACK FOOT TO THE FRONT LIFTING THE FRONT LEG AND EXTEND
gM0gs9Umw-Y_9 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO RETURN RIGHT TO POSITION FOUR
GsgXatk8ayI_1 0 KICKER IS AN ADDITIONAL COST THAT YOU CAN PAY IN ADDITIONAL TO THE NORMAL COST OF THE SPELL
GsgXatk8ayI_2 0 HERE WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF A CARD WITH KICKER AND THIS IS CALLED DRALNU'S PET
GsgXatk8ayI_3 0 NORMALLY IT COSTS ONE COLORLESS AND TWO BLUE BUT WITH THE KICKER COSTS OF TWO COLORLESS AND ONE BLACK THE TOTAL COST BECOMES SIX TWO BLUE ONE BLACK AND THREE COLORLESS
GsgXatk8ayI_4 0 THE ADDITIONAL KICKER COSTS IS THAT YOU DISCARD A CREATURE CARD FROM YOUR HAND
GsgXatk8ayI_5 0 NOW IT'S NORMALLY JUST A 2/2 FOR THREE BUT IF YOU PAY THE KICKER COSTS THEN IT ALSO GETS FLYING AND X ONE ONE COUNTERS WHERE X IS THE DISCARDED CREATURE CARD'S CONVERTED MANA COSTS
GsgXatk8ayI_6 0 SO IF YOU FOR INSTANCE DISCARDED A FROG MITE AND PAID SIX FOR THE CREATURE IT WOULD BE A 4/4 FLYING RATHER THAN JUST A 2/2
GsgXatk8ayI_7 0 THE KICKER COST MUST BE ANNOUNCED DURING THE PLAYING OF THE SPELL OR ABILITY WHEN YOU ANNOUNCE ADDITIONAL COSTS WHEN YOU CHOOSE YOUR MODE AND DECIDE WHAT X IS
gw4Kxu8tyjU_1 0 NOW WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE PEN TOOL
gw4Kxu8tyjU_2 0 WE JUST CREATED THIS SHAPE USING THE PEN TOOL
gw4Kxu8tyjU_3 0 WHAT I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU NOW IS THE ADDITIONAL PEN TOOLS
gw4Kxu8tyjU_4 0 REMEMBER HOW WE SPOKE ABOUT IF THERE'S A LITTLE BLACK ARROW IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER WHICH THERE IS ON THE PEN TOOL
gw4Kxu8tyjU_5 0 THERE ARE ADDITIONAL TOOLS IN THE DRAWER
gw4Kxu8tyjU_6 0 SO WE'VE GOT THE PEN TOOL UNDERNEATH THE PEN TOOL WE'VE GOT THE ADD ANCHOR POINT TOOL WHICH IS PRETTY SELF EXPLANATORY
gw4Kxu8tyjU_7 0 IF WE DECIDE WE WANT IT AHEAD AT THE POINT SIMPLY CLICK RIGHT THERE AND IF WE GET OUR SUB-SELECTION TOOL AND DRAG THAT OUT
gw4Kxu8tyjU_8 0 THE NEXT TOOL DOWN IS THE DELETE ANCHOR POINT TOOL AGAIN WE JUST WANT TO DELETE IT AND AWAY IT GOES
gw4Kxu8tyjU_9 0 AND OUR FINAL TOOL IN THE PEN DRAWER IS THE CONVERT ANCHOR POINT TOOL
gw4Kxu8tyjU_10 0 NOW THIS TOOL IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST MISUNDERSTOOD TOOLS AT LEAST WHEN I STARTED USING FLASH AND ILLUSTRATOR AND THEY BOTH WORK THE SAME
gw4Kxu8tyjU_11 0 IF YOU TAKE YOUR TOOL AND I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO ZOOM IN SO THAT WE CAN OOPS SO WE CAN SEE A LITTLE BETTER
gw4Kxu8tyjU_12 0 IF YOU TAKE YOUR TOOL AND CLICK AND DRAG YOU GET THESE NICE HANDLES
gw4Kxu8tyjU_13 0 WE'LL SOME PEOPLE YOU KNOW THEY THINK THAT THE WHOLE THING IS MESSED UP BECAUSE THEY'LL DRAG AND GET THESE WEIRD LOOKING SHAPES HIT UNDO
gw4Kxu8tyjU_14 0 BASICALLY IF YOU CLICK AND DRAG YOU HAVE TO DRAG OUT TO THE SIDE DEPENDING ON HOW FAR FROM THE ORIGINAL POINT THESE HANDLES ARE WILL DEPEND ON HOW WIDE YOUR ARCH IS GOING TO BE
gw4Kxu8tyjU_15 0 SO IF YOU JUST REMEMBER THAT SIMPLE POINT
gw4Kxu8tyjU_16 0 NOW IF YOU CROSS OVER YOU'RE GOING TO GET THIS GOING ON WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT IT'S BASICALLY A WAY TO ROUND OUT SOME OF THOSE CORNERS
gw4Kxu8tyjU_17 0 IF I DECIDE I WANT TO DO IT ON ALL OF THESE CORNERS MAKING SURE TO GO THE RIGHT WAY RATHER THAN TO YOU KNOW GOING THIS WAY
gw4Kxu8tyjU_18 0 SO MAKE SURE YOU GO THE RIGHT WAY HERE AND ANOTHER QUICK SHORTCUT IS IF YOU HOLD DOWN THE SPACE BAR YOU GET THIS HAND THAT ALLOWS YOU TO NAVIGATE WITHOUT HAVING TO SCROLL
gw4Kxu8tyjU_19 0 BUT NOW REAL QUICKLY I WAS ABLE TO TAKE THAT SHAPE THAT WAS VERY ANGULAR AND IF WE ZOOM OUT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THAT IT'S NOW COMPLETELY ORGANIC WITH ROUND CORNERS
gw4Kxu8tyjU_20 0 SO THATS THE SUITE OF PEN TOOLS FINISHING WITH THE CONVERT ANCHOR POINT TOOL
HcN-7Wgepko_1 0 HI THIS IS BILL MACPHERSON FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
HcN-7Wgepko_2 0 OKAY IN THESE SERIES OF CLIPS WE ARE GOING TO BE SHOWING THE NEW FEATURES IN ADOBE FLASH CS3
HcN-7Wgepko_3 0 IT USE TO BE OWNED BY MICROMEDIA AND BUT THEY WERE BOUGHT OUT BY ADOBE AND THEY ADDED TO THEIR CS SWEET OF PROGRAMS
HcN-7Wgepko_4 0 ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT THAT IS NOW YOU CAN IMPORT PHOTOSHOP DIRECTLY INTO FLASH
HcN-7Wgepko_5 0 SO THAT IS WHAT I'M GOING TO BE SHOWING YOU TODAY SOME OF THOSE FEATURES AND A FEW OTHER NEW FEATURES INSIDE FLASH ITSELF
HcN-7Wgepko_6 0 NOW WHAT I HAVE RIGHT HERE IS A PROJECT THAT I'M WORKING ON IT IS A COMPLETE FLASH WEBSITE DONE WITH PHOTOSHOP AND FLASH
HcN-7Wgepko_7 0 NOW THIS IS THE HOME PAGE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT RIGHT HERE AND WHAT I LIKE TO FIRST DISCUSS IS THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING EVERYTHING ORGANIZED
HcN-7Wgepko_8 0 NOW INSIDE PHOTOSHOP WE HAVE TONS OF LAYERS THAT I HAVE CREATED FOR THIS DOCUMENT
HcN-7Wgepko_9 0 EACH FOR ITS OWN LINK PAGE
HcN-7Wgepko_10 0 I LIKE TO START OFF WITH THE BACKGROUND FIRST WE WOULD TURN OFF THESE LAYERS
HcN-7Wgepko_11 0 NOW THE BACKGROUND IS ONLY TWO LAYERS AND THIS BLACK BACK THAT I HAVE IS THE ONLY LAYER THAT I WON'T IMPORT INTO FLASH
HcN-7Wgepko_12 0 WE JUST SET THE BACKGROUND TO BACK INSIDE FLASH AND THEN WE HAVE THIS PURPLE OUTWORK THAT I CREATED ON TOP SO THAT IS THE ONLY ONE THAT I WOULD BRING IT AND OF COURSE I NAMED IT BACKGROUND ART
HcN-7Wgepko_13 0 AND IT IS INSIDE A FOLDER
HcN-7Wgepko_14 0 IN THE NEXT CLIP WE WOULD TALK ABOUT CREATING A HEADER TO IMPORT INTO FLASH
HcN-7Wgepko_15 0 THIS IS BILL MACPHERSON FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
Gr_zhEQuXsU_1 0 THEN WE ALSO HAVE YOUR SNELLED HOOKS WHICH IS A STANDARD SNELLED HOOK
Gr_zhEQuXsU_2 0 IT'S ARCHED AND ALREADY PRE-TIED WITH A LOOP ON THE END
Gr_zhEQuXsU_3 0 YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THESE ARE COMMONLY SOLD IN PACKAGES SIX PACKS USUALLY
Gr_zhEQuXsU_4 0 THEY ARE VERY HELPFUL TO USE WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING MINNOWS AND OTHER DEVICES
Gr_zhEQuXsU_5 0 WE ALSO HAVE SPECIALTY TYPE SET-UPS WHERE WE HAVE HOOKS SWIVELS AND FLIES ATTACHED TO A LINE WITH AN EGG WEIGHT SINKER AN EGG DROP SINKER ON THE BOTTOM
Gr_zhEQuXsU_6 0 NOW THIS IS A LEAD SINKER AND SO ARE THESE ONES
Gr_zhEQuXsU_7 0 THE RULING IN SOME STATES IS ONE OUNCE OR LESS HAS TO BE THE TIN STEEL OR TUNGSTEN
Gr_zhEQuXsU_8 0 SO THERE ARE STATES THAT DO NOT ALLOW ANYTHING LESS THAN ONE OUNCE OR LESS IN LEAD
Gr_zhEQuXsU_9 0 THAT IS TO PREVENT WATER FOWL AND BIRDS FROM INGESTING THEM
Gr_zhEQuXsU_10 0 NOW WE ALSO HAVE HERE WHAT IS CALLED A FLASHER
Gr_zhEQuXsU_11 0 THIS IS USED ON A PERCH RIG
Gr_zhEQuXsU_12 0 IT ACTS AS BOTH A WEIGHT AND A MEANS OF GETTING ATTENTION BY FLASHING AT THE FISH
Gr_zhEQuXsU_13 0 WHAT FISH WILL SEE IS A REFLECTION OF LIGHT SO THAT THEY WILL BE ATTRACTED TO THAT LIGHT AND COME IN AS IF IT WERE MINNOWS SWIMMING
gkyXhfyq-zY_1 0 A RING HITCH IS JUST A REALLY SIMPLE LITTLE HITCH
gkyXhfyq-zY_2 0 YOU KNOW IF YOU TAKE A LOOP OF ROPE THAT YOU WANT TO ATTACH JUST ANY EVERYDAY OBJECTS WITH
gkyXhfyq-zY_3 0 IF YOU LOOK DOWN HERE I WOULD SHOW YOU
gkyXhfyq-zY_4 0 WE HAVE A LITTLE COPPER RING THAT I'M GOING TO USE HERE AND HERE IS MY LENGTH OF ROPE WITH A KNOT TIED IN IT
gkyXhfyq-zY_5 0 SO I HAVE A NICE LOOP GOING ON HERE
gkyXhfyq-zY_6 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS JUST TAKE IT TAKE MY INITIAL LOOP AND JUST RUN IT THROUGH THE RING
gkyXhfyq-zY_7 0 NOW YOU CAN JUST TAKE IT YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU PULL ENOUGH LENGTH HERE AND JUST WRAP IT OVER AND UNDER AND PULL IT TIGHT LIKE THIS
gkyXhfyq-zY_8 0 YOU SEE IT CREATES THIS ALMOST LIKE A BUTTERFLY LOOK TO IT HERE
gkyXhfyq-zY_9 0 LET'S DO THAT ONE MORE TIME
gkyXhfyq-zY_10 0 PULL IT OFF HERE IS OUR RING AND HERE IS OUR LOOP
gkyXhfyq-zY_11 0 I'M JUST GOING TO SHOVE IT THROUGH HERE AND JUST OPEN IT UP
gkyXhfyq-zY_12 0 YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH ROPE TO ACTUALLY SLIDE AROUND THE OBJECT THAT YOU GOING TO BE USING
gkyXhfyq-zY_13 0 JUST PULL IT YOU HAVE TO WORK IT A LITTLE BIT
gkyXhfyq-zY_14 0 YOU SEE IT TIGHTENS RIGHT ON UP AND IT WOULD HOLD SOMETHING AND YOU USE THIS FOR ANYTHING
gkyXhfyq-zY_15 0 IF YOU WANT TO ATTACH LIKE A LITTLE SOMETHING TO YOUR KEY RING OR WHATEVER THIS WOULD BE THE SIMPLEST EASIEST WAY TO DO THIS
gswFDWQ2owI_1 0 OUR NEXT NECK OPENING COLLAR STYLE IS A TAB COLLAR
gswFDWQ2owI_2 0 WHAT A TAB COLLAR IS IS NOT THE COLA A TAB COLLAR HAS TABS
gswFDWQ2owI_3 0 TABS AS I INDICATED RIGHT HERE ARE GOING TO BE ATTACHED TO THE COLLAR AND WHEN YOU FOLD THE COLLAR DOWN AND OVER THEN THEY'LL BE BUTTONED UP WITH BUTTONS THAT ARE ATTACH TO THE SHIRT
gswFDWQ2owI_4 0 A TAB IN SEWING LINGO DESIGN STYLE IS GOING TO BE SHAPE LIKE THIS
gswFDWQ2owI_5 0 THAT IS THE SHAPE OF A TAB AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE THE THE BUTTON HOLE AND THEN WHEN YOU ATTACH IT TO WHATEVER IT WOULD HAVE A BUTTON COME THROUGH IT
gswFDWQ2owI_6 0 BUT A TAB ON THE COLLAR IS ATTACH TO THE COLLAR AND THEN WE HAVE THE ATTACH
gswFDWQ2owI_7 0 USUALLY THERE'S GOING TO BE A BUTTON POCKET BUT THE TAB SHAPE IS WHAT THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT TO THIS IS
gswFDWQ2owI_8 0 IT CAN BE IF WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOPED LIKE THAT THEN IT WOULDN'T BE CALLED A TAB COLLAR
gswFDWQ2owI_9 0 THIS YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A TAB TO HAVE IT BE A TAB COLLAR
GUVtixB4b6s_1 0 SO EVEN THOUGH WE JUST TALKED ABOUT HOW THIS SPACE HAS A LOT OF CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF STORAGE THERE IS ACTUALLY A LOT OF POTENTIAL FOR ADDING STORAGE IN HERE
GUVtixB4b6s_2 0 THE GREATEST POTENTIAL PROBABLY COMES FROM THE REFRIGERATOR
GUVtixB4b6s_3 0 REFRIGERATORS SINCE THEY ARE MAGNETIC THERE ARE A LOT OF STORAGE OPTIONS FOR ACTUALLY PUTTING MAGNETS ON YOUR REFRIGERATOR THAT HOLD HERBS OR UTENSILS THAT KIND OF THING
GUVtixB4b6s_4 0 THE TOP OF THE REFRIGERATOR ALWAYS GOOD FOR STORAGE
GUVtixB4b6s_5 0 THERE ARE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT I'LL GET INTO LATER TO CREATE STORAGE USING THESE THESE SHELVES THINGIES AND THEN ALSO THE BIGGEST THING THAT'S WORKING OVER HERE FOR ME ANYWAY IS THE WINDOW
GUVtixB4b6s_6 0 SO I'VE GOT A LOT OF LIGHT OVER HERE AND ALSO THIS SPACE EVEN THOUGH IT IS A SMALL SPACE
GUVtixB4b6s_7 0 I CAN CHOOSE WHAT I PUT IN THERE SO THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS OF THINGS THAT I CAN PUT IN THERE

g-EpkBK3-q8_4 0 IN FACT I'VE HAD THIS ONE FOR PROBABLY FIFTEEN YEARS
g-EpkBK3-q8_5 0 YOU CAN SEE OCCASIONALLY I PUT A COAT OF PAINT ON IT JUST TO KEEP IT FRESH
g-EpkBK3-q8_6 0 BUT YOU CAN SIMPLY CHANGE THE BLADE WHICH IS EASILY AVAILABLE
g-EpkBK3-q8_7 0 IT TAKES ABOUT TWO SECONDS TO DO IT SO YOU CAN PUT A NEW BLADE IN WHEN THIS ONE GETS TOO DULL

g-EpkBK3-q8_9 0 YOU CAN PROBABLY CUT UP TO A THREE OR FOUR INCH LIMB OFF YOUR OAK TREE OR YOUR MAPLE BY USING A BOW SAW
g-EpkBK3-q8_10 0 IF YOU'RE WORKING ON CITRUS OR FRUITING TREES A BOW SAW IS A MUST BECAUSE FROM TIME TO TIME IF YOU'VE GOT DEAD WOOD YOU'VE GOT TO REMOVE IT AND THAT'S WHERE YOU NEED A HANDSAW LIKE THIS
g-EpkBK3-q8_11 0 AND THAT'S WHAT A BOW SAW IS IT'S A TYPE OF HANDSAW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE ON THOSE BIGGER BRANCHES

GcQeUIvMr_o_5 0 SO WE TAKE A LITTLE DROP OF FOOD COLORING FOOD COLORING IS VERY VERY CONCENTRATED EVEN WHEN YOU BUY SO IT IS GOOD TO DILUTE IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF WATER
GcQeUIvMr_o_6 0 I WANT TO MENTION COLORING IT CAN BE MORE PROFESSIONAL KIND OF CAUSE YOU CAN MIX DIFFERENT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT COLORS YOU CAN MAKE IT LIGHTER ON ONE SIDE DARKER ON THE OTHER SIDE WHICH GIVES IT A SHADY KIND OF LOOK
GcQeUIvMr_o_7 0 BUT IT IS SIMPLER TO USE A READY COLORED MARZIPAN
GcQeUIvMr_o_8 0 NOW I'M GOING TO USE THE GREEN FOOD COLORING JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU EITHER USE A DIFFERENT PAINT BRUSH OR WASH YOUR PAINT BRUSH VERY GOOD USE A DIFFERENT BOWL OR AGAIN WASH YOU BOWL REALLY GOOD OTHERWISE YOU ARE GOING TO GET A TOTALLY DIFFERENT COLOR FROM WHAT YOU WANTED

HBgZgpSzHBU_2 0 WHEN DEALING WITH A CLIENT FOR A HAIR PIECE
HBgZgpSzHBU_3 0 WHAT I USUALLY ASK THEM TO DO IS TO PICTURE THEMSELVES HOW THEY WANT TO LOOK

HBgZgpSzHBU_7 0 THE LESS HAIR YOU CAN PUT INTO A HAIR PIECE THE BETTER
HBgZgpSzHBU_8 0 USUALLY THE REASON WHY PEOPLE GET NOTICED WEARING A HAIRPIECE IS BECAUSE THEY ARE WHAT WE CALL IN ENGLAND A RUG
HBgZgpSzHBU_9 0 FAR TOO MUCH VOLUME TOO PERFECT A HAIR LINE
HBgZgpSzHBU_10 0 QUITE OFTEN PEOPLE WILL DESIGN A HAIR PIECE WITH A STRAIGHT LINE STRAIGHT ACROSS AND A PERFECT HAIR LINE
HBgZgpSzHBU_11 0 USUALLY IN ANY MAN EVEN AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD MAN THEY HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RECESSION AND THIS IS WHAT I ALWAYS BUILD INTO MY PIECES

G5z-B1wbnM0_10 0 IF YOU'RE A LIGHT SLEEPER AND IF IT RINGS OR BEEPS YOU'RE GOING TO BE UP IT'LL REALLY MESS UP YOUR SLEEP PATTERN
G5z-B1wbnM0_11 0 MAKE SURE YOU TRY TO TURN YOUR CELL PHONE ON VIBRATE SILENT OR EVEN OFF
G5z-B1wbnM0_12 0 ALSO ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS
G5z-B1wbnM0_13 0 ONCE YOUR BODY RELAXES AND YOU GET A GOOD NAP YOU MAY JUST SLEEP ALL NIGHT SO YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SET YOUR ALARM CLOCK
G5z-B1wbnM0_14 0 DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU DO BEFORE YOU GO TO WORK I SUGGEST THAT YOU GO AHEAD AND SET IT FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS BEFORE THE TIME THAT YOU NEED TO BE A WORK
G5z-B1wbnM0_15 0 ALLOW YOURSELF TIME TO GET TO WORK
G5z-B1wbnM0_16 0 ALLOW YOURSELF TIME TO EAT WHEN YOU GET UP AND ALLOW YOURSELF TIME TO MAYBE SHOWER OR DO WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU NEED TO DO BEFORE MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE AWAKE ALERT AND READY FOR THE NIGHT

GcXO91ifHJc_1 0 HRT CAN BE TAKEN IN MANY WAYS
GcXO91ifHJc_2 0 IT COMES IN MANY FORMS IN A PILL YOU CAN TAKE IT IN A PILL FORM THERE ARE CREAMS THERE ARE PATCHES
GcXO91ifHJc_3 0 SO IT'S UP TO YOU WHICH IS THE MOST CONVENIENT FOR YOU AND THE KIND OF PREFERRED METHOD TO TAKE HRT
GcXO91ifHJc_4 0 NOW AS I SAID THERE ARE BENEFITS FOR TAKING THIS TREATMENT OPTION AND THEN THERE ARE ALSO RISKS
GcXO91ifHJc_5 0 AND SOME OF THE RISKS IS THAT IF YOU'RE TAKING SPECIFICALLY A CONTINUOUS SCHEDULE THAT MEANS YOU ARE ALWAYS ON ESTROGEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE AT A RISK OF INCREASING THE RISK OF GETTING CERTAIN CANCERS LIKE ENDOMETRIAL CANCER BECAUSE YOU'RE UNDER THE CONDITION CALLED ANAPOST ESTROGEN EFFECT
GcXO91ifHJc_6 0 ANOTHER NATURAL HERBAL COMPOUNDS IF YOU TAKE THAT'S WHY WE ALWAYS RECOMMEND THAT YOU DON'T TAKE HERBAL COMPOUNDS OR REMEDIES UNTIL YOU CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR
GcXO91ifHJc_7 0 WHEN YOU GO THROUGH MENOPAUSE IS THAT CERTAIN COMPOUNDS LIKE GINSENG AND YAM HAS THIS ANAPOST ESTROGEN EFFECT IN IT
GcXO91ifHJc_8 0 SO YOU NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THAT AND ALWAYS CONSULT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU DO THAT
GcXO91ifHJc_9 0 SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY BE FAMILIAR WITH BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO TAKE HRT OR HORMONAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY
GcXO91ifHJc_10 0 WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GO AND SEE A DOCTOR YOU CAN TALK ABOUT IT IN DETAIL WITH HIM

HIZq2gXBsHU_1 0 HI MY NAME IS COLIN KILBANE AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A CLOUD IN A BOTTLE TODAY
HIZq2gXBsHU_2 0 NOW THE FIRST THING THAT YOU NEED IS A JUICE BOTTLE
HIZq2gXBsHU_3 0 NOW THIS JUICE BOTTLE NEEDS TO HAVE A NICE TIGHT-FITTING LID
HIZq2gXBsHU_4 0 THE SECOND THING YOU ARE GOING TO NEED IS A SMALL ATTACHMENT THAT ALLOWS YOU TO FILL UP SPORTS BALLS BEACH BALLS FROM A BIKE PUMP
HIZq2gXBsHU_5 0 NOW THE IMPORTANT PART IS THE ATTACHMENT FOR THE BICYCLE PUMP HERE
HIZq2gXBsHU_6 0 YOU CAN USE A METAL OR PLASTIC
HIZq2gXBsHU_7 0 I HAVE PLASTIC TODAY
HIZq2gXBsHU_8 0 YOU ARE GOING TO NEED A SET OF FIREPLACE MATCHES A BICYCLE PUMP AND YOU ARE GOING TO NEED A LITTLE BIT OF WATER
HIZq2gXBsHU_10 0 AND FINALLY MY FAVORITE HOT GLUE
HIZq2gXBsHU_11 0 NOW TAKE YOUR CAP NOW I'VE ALREADY DRILLED A HOLE IN HERE BUT YOU NEED TO JUST BE ABLE TO SLIDE THEE PUMP ATTACHMENT UP TO THROUGH THE CAP
HIZq2gXBsHU_12 0 NOW WE NEED TO SEAL THIS IN
HIZq2gXBsHU_13 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ON THE BOTTOM SIDE HERE WE'RE GOING TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF HOT GLUE ALL AROUND IT
HIZq2gXBsHU_14 0 THIS IS GOING TO PROVIDE US WITH AN AIR-TIGHT SEAL JUST RELATIVELY STRONG
HIZq2gXBsHU_15 0 WE'RE GOING TO WAIT FOR THIS TO COOL DOWN AND THEN WE'RE ALMOST READY TO GO
HIZq2gXBsHU_16 0 WHILE THAT FINISHES COOLING DOWN WE NEED TO CREATE A CLOUD IN A BOTTLE SO THE FIRST THING THAT WE NEED IS MOISTURE
HIZq2gXBsHU_17 0 THAT'S THE WATER
HIZq2gXBsHU_18 0 WE'RE GOING TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF WATER INSIDE THIS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO SHAKE IT AROUND
HIZq2gXBsHU_19 0 JUST WET THEE INSIDE OF THE BOTTLE RIGHT
HIZq2gXBsHU_20 0 POUR OUT ANY REMAINING LIQUID AND YOU CAN SEE WE'VE GOT WATER DROPLETS ON THEE INSIDE
HIZq2gXBsHU_21 0 THAT'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH FOR US
HIZq2gXBsHU_22 0 THE SECOND THING WE NEED IS SOMETHING FOR THE CLOUDS TO FORM ON
HIZq2gXBsHU_23 0 THIS MOISTURE IS GOING TO BE TURNED INTO OUR CLOUD
HIZq2gXBsHU_24 0 WE'RE GOING TO NEED SOMETHING TO SEED THE CLOUDS
HIZq2gXBsHU_25 0 NOW THESE MATCHES ARE QUITE LONG AND THERE'S A REASON YOU NEED THEM QUITE LONG
HIZq2gXBsHU_26 0 YOU WANT TO GET IT GOING CAUSE WHAT YOU WANT HERE IS NOT THE FLAME
HIZq2gXBsHU_27 0 YOU WANT THE SMOKE
HIZq2gXBsHU_28 0 THE SMOKE IS GOING TO SEED OUR CLOUD INSIDE THE BOTTLE
HIZq2gXBsHU_29 0 GRAB YOUR BOTTLE BLOW OUT THE MATCH
HIZq2gXBsHU_30 0 YOU GET A LITTLE BIT OF SMOKE THERE
HIZq2gXBsHU_31 0 PULL IT OUT
HIZq2gXBsHU_32 0 OUR CAP SHOULD BE REASONABLY COOL NOW AND READY TO ATTACH
HIZq2gXBsHU_33 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING MOLECULES OF AIR IN
HIZq2gXBsHU_34 0 TIGHTEN IT UP
HIZq2gXBsHU_35 0 AS WE PUMP MORE AND MORE MOLECULES OF AIR THESE MOLECULES COLLIDE WITH EACH OTHER AND THE TEMPERATURE RISES
HIZq2gXBsHU_36 0 NOW AS THE TEMPERATURE RISES WATER IS ABSORBED INTO THE AIR
HIZq2gXBsHU_38 0 AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S BULGING
HIZq2gXBsHU_39 0 DON'T USE A MECHANICAL AIR PUMP FOR THIS
HIZq2gXBsHU_40 0 YOU CAN BURST THE BOTTLE
HIZq2gXBsHU_41 0 NOW HERE'S THE TRICK
HIZq2gXBsHU_42 0 WE'VE PUMPED A LOT OF AIR IN THERE
HIZq2gXBsHU_43 0 THE AIR HAS INCREASED IN TEMPERATURE HAS ABSORBED THE WATER
HIZq2gXBsHU_44 0 NOW WE NEED TO RELEASE A LOT OF THAT PRESSURE VERY FAST
HIZq2gXBsHU_45 0 THAT'S WHY WE'RE USING A JUICE BOTTLE INSTEAD OF A POP BOTTLE CAUSE IT HAS A WIDE OPENING HERE
HIZq2gXBsHU_46 0 GET A GOOD POP HERE
HIZq2gXBsHU_47 0 THERE WE GO AND WE GET A CLOUD IN A BOTTLE
HIZq2gXBsHU_48 0 AND THAT IS HOW TO MAKE A CLOUD IN A BOTTLE
gV9Sp0tF_y8_1 0 WHY DO I NEED TRAINING
gV9Sp0tF_y8_2 0 I'VE TRAVELED A LOT AND I LOVE PEOPLE AND I LOVE TRAVEL
gV9Sp0tF_y8_3 0 AND THE COMPANIES GET LOTS OF RESUMES THAT SAY I LOVE PEOPLE AND I LOVE TRAVEL SO I WOULD BE A GREAT TOUR DIRECTOR AND THAT HELPS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT DONNA
gV9Sp0tF_y8_4 0 IF YOU YOU'VE BEEN TO AFRICA LET'S SAY ON VACATION AND I HAVEN'T BEEN TO AFRICA I CAN LEAD A TOUR TO AFRICA BETTER THAN YOU CAN BECAUSE I KNOW TOUR PROCEDURES I'M A TRAINED TOUR DIRECTOR I KNOW TOUR PROCEDURES AND THAT'S HOW I AM HIRED THE COMPANIES CAN SEND ME ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND THEY KNOW I KNOW TOUR PROCEDURES
gV9Sp0tF_y8_5 0 AND I KNOW THE RIGHT QUESTIONS TO ASK I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THE AIRPORTS THE HOTELS THE MOTOR COACHES THE INBOUND TOUR OPERATORS THE LOCAL GUIDES
gV9Sp0tF_y8_6 0 I KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THAT AND HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO HOW TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY MY TOUR MEMBERS HOW TO HANDLE CHALLENGES IN THOSE PLACES TOO AND BELIEVE ME I'VE HAD A LOT OF CHALLENGES IN PLACES LIKE THAT
gV9Sp0tF_y8_7 0 SO YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW TO LEAD THE TOUR IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT
gV9Sp0tF_y8_8 0 WHEN I TRAIN MY TOUR TOUR MEMBERS OR WHEN I TRAIN MY STUDENTS THEY CAN GO TO PUT ON THEIR RESUME THEY CAN TELL THE TOUR OPERATORS I KNOW PROCEDURES FOR INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC TOURS I KNOW SAFETY AND PROCEDURES FOR HOTELS AND FOR AIRLINES I KNOW TOUR BRIEFINGS
gV9Sp0tF_y8_9 0 THEY WILL OFTEN ASK YOU WHAT DO YOU COVER IN YOUR BRIEFINGS AND IF IT'S SOMEBODY THAT IS NOT EXPERIENCED THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO COVER IN THE BRIEFINGS YOU KNOW THEY'LL SAY OKAY HERE'S A CHALLENGE WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IF THIS HAPPENS
gV9Sp0tF_y8_10 0 AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TOURS ARE RUN WITH INBOUND TOUR OPERATORS OUTBOUND TOUR OPERATORS RECEPTORS SERVICES DMC'S YOU DON'T KNOW HOW ALL THAT'S RUN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM TRYING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION CORRECTLY BECAUSE WE ARE NOT A HOST
gV9Sp0tF_y8_11 0 YOU NEED TO KNOW DOCUMENTATION YOU NEED TO KNOW THE LEGALITIES YOU NEED TO KNOW WHO THE EMPLOYERS ARE WHO ARE THE MAJOR EMPLOYERS WHAT DO THEY LOOK FOR WHAT ARE THEY MARKETED TO THERE'S SOME MARKETS YOU'D BE GREAT IN THERE'S SOME MARKETS YOU WOULDN'T EVEN WANT TO WORK IN
gV9Sp0tF_y8_12 0 WHEN I DO MY TRAINING I SHARE ALL OF THE NAMES I HAVE COMPANIES THAT HAVE CONTACTED ME LOOKING FOR PROFESSIONALLY TRAINED TOUR DIRECTORS WHICH I POST IN MY ONLINE CLASS SO WHEN THEY GO TO THE TOUR OPERATORS THEY CAN SAY I'M A PROFESSIONALLY TRAINED TOUR DIRECTOR THIS IS WHAT I KNOW THEY CAN LIST OUT THEIR SKILLS AND IMMEDIATELY THEY HAVE THE ATTENTION OF THE TOUR COMPANY AS COMPARED TO SOMEBODY AND NOT ANYTHING PERSONAL YOU'D PROBABLY MAKE A GREAT TOUR DIRECTOR BUT THAT SAYS I LOVE PEOPLE AND I LOVE TRAVEL
gV9Sp0tF_y8_13 0 THEY GET THOUSANDS OF RESUMES THAT SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO STAND OUT AND YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
GhfY1UC0ihw_1 0 SO WHEN COLORING GREY HAIR SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO ARE MAKE SURE YOU WEAR YOUR GLOVES
GhfY1UC0ihw_2 0 THAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU PAY ATTENTION TO
GhfY1UC0ihw_3 0 MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A WIDE TOOTH COMB
GhfY1UC0ihw_4 0 BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO USE THAT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS
GhfY1UC0ihw_5 0 MAKE SURE YOU'VE PUT CONDITIONER OR VASELINE AROUND THE HAIRLINE SO THE HAIR COLOR DOES NOT GRAB THE SKIN
GhfY1UC0ihw_6 0 IF YOU NOTICE MYRA HAS NO STAINS ON HER SKIN WHATSOEVER
GhfY1UC0ihw_7 0 BECAUSE I COVERED HER AND PROTECTED HER SKIN FROM THE HAIR COLOR
GhfY1UC0ihw_8 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SECTION WITH THE FOUR SECTIONS SO YOU'RE WORKING WITH A SMALL SECTION AT A TIME
GhfY1UC0ihw_9 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GO THROUGH AND APPLY YOUR COLOR IN HALF INCH SECTIONS ALL THE WAY THROUGH
GhfY1UC0ihw_10 0 SECTION BY SECTION WORK YOUR WAY AROUND
GhfY1UC0ihw_11 0 YOU WANT TO DOUBLE CHECK YOUR WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'VE NOT MISSED ANY SPOTS
GhfY1UC0ihw_12 0 BECAUSE THAT WILL SHOW UP LATER ON
GhfY1UC0ihw_13 0 YOU'LL SEE YOUR GREY WILL SHINE THOUGH
GhfY1UC0ihw_14 0 THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE COLOR START TO CHANGE AND PROCESS
GhfY1UC0ihw_15 0 MAKE SURE YOU'VE READ YOUR DIRECTIONS THOROUGHLY
GhfY1UC0ihw_16 0 YOU ALWAYS WANT TO FINISH WITH A CONDITIONER
GhfY1UC0ihw_17 0 WIDE TOOTH COMB THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS
GhfY1UC0ihw_18 0 AND THEN YOUR GREY HAIR COVERAGE HAIR COLOR COVERAGE SHOULD TURN OUT SUCCESSFUL
GhfY1UC0ihw_19 0 AND THAT'S HOW YOU GO THROUGH THE PROCESS
gNRVAI30QrA_1 0 HI THIS IS GARY ZYER FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
gNRVAI30QrA_2 0 LET'S NOW TAKE A LOOK AT THE ACTUAL PLAY OF THE GAME
gNRVAI30QrA_3 0 A NORMAL TURN CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS THE DRAW AND THE DISCARD
gNRVAI30QrA_4 0 THE PLAYER WHOSE TURN IT IS STARTS BY DRAWING OR TAKING ONE CARD FROM EITHER THE TOP OF THE STOCK PILE OR THE TOP CARD ON THE DISCARD PILE AND ADDING IT TO HIS HAND
gNRVAI30QrA_5 0 THE DISCARD PILE IS FACE UP SO YOU SEE IN ADVANCE WHAT YOU'RE GETTING
gNRVAI30QrA_6 0 THE STOCK PILE IS FACE DOWN
gNRVAI30QrA_7 0 SO IF YOU CHOOSE TO DRAW FROM THE STOCK PILE YOU DON'T SEE THE CARD UNTIL AFTER YOU HAVE COMMITTED YOURSELF TO TAKE IT
gNRVAI30QrA_8 0 IF YOU DRAW FROM THE STOCK YOU ADD THE CARD TO YOUR HAND WITHOUT SHOWING IT TO THE OTHER PLAYERS
gNRVAI30QrA_9 0 IN THIS CASE WE'RE PLAYING WITH AN OPEN HAND
gNRVAI30QrA_10 0 TO COMPLETE YOUR TURN ONE CARD MUST BE DISCARDED FROM YOUR HAND AND PLACED ON TOP OF THE DISCARD PILE FACE UP
gNRVAI30QrA_11 0 IF YOU STARTED YOUR TURN BY TAKING THE TOP CARD IN THE DISCARD PILE YOU MUST DISCARD A DIFFERENT CARD FROM YOUR HAND
gNRVAI30QrA_12 0 TAKING THE TOP DISCARD AND PUTTING THE SAME CARD BACK IS NOT PERMITTED
gNRVAI30QrA_13 0 SO BE SURE THAT ONCE YOU TAKE THE CARD FROM THE DISCARD PILE THAT YOU REALLY DO NEED IT BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER TURN TO LAY IT BACK DOWN IN THE DISCARD PILE IF YOU DON'T
gNRVAI30QrA_14 0 IN MY CASE I DREW THE NINE OF SPADES FROM THE STOCK PILE
gNRVAI30QrA_15 0 NOW I'M HOLDING ELEVEN CARDS IN MY HAND
gNRVAI30QrA_16 0 I NEED TO GET RID OF ONE
gNRVAI30QrA_17 0 SO I CAN EITHER TAKE THE NINE OF SPADES THAT I JUST PICKED IF IT DOESN'T HELP MY HAND AT ALL AND I CAN TAKE THAT ONE AND PUT IT INTO THE DISCARD PILE
gNRVAI30QrA_18 0 OR IF I DECIDE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP THE NINE OF SPADES I WOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE ANOTHER CARD FROM MY HAND AND PLACE THAT CARD INTO THE DISCARD PILE
gNRVAI30QrA_19 0 BUT WE CAN ONLY BE HOLDING ON TO TEN CARDS AT ONE TIME
gNRVAI30QrA_20 0 SO THAT FINISHES THE SECOND PART OF THE TURN THE DISCARD
gNRVAI30QrA_21 0 AND NOW PLAY GOES OVER TO THE OPPONENT

-Hhlzk2X_Ck_5 0 SO I'M GOING TO CHOOSE THIS FIRST COLOR
-Hhlzk2X_Ck_6 0 YOU SEE I ALWAYS USE A SPATULA AND I ALWAYS USE THAT SO I DON'T PUT MY SPONGE IN THE FOUNDATION
-Hhlzk2X_Ck_7 0 THAT WAY THE FOUNDATION WON'T GET CONTAMINATED

h8alXw0uBc8_1 0 NOW WE'RE READY TO DECORATE OUR STRIPS BEFORE WE PLACE THEM ONTO THE WINDMILL
h8alXw0uBc8_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE DECORATING THE STRIPS WITH MATCHSTICKS
h8alXw0uBc8_3 0 THEY'RE NOT REAL MATCHES OF COURSE BUT THEY'RE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AND IT'S THE STICK PART OF THE MATCHES AND THEY'VE BEEN COLORED
h8alXw0uBc8_4 0 USUALLY WHEN YOU BUY THEM IN A BIG PACKAGE YOU HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT COLORS
h8alXw0uBc8_5 0 THE WAY WE DO THIS IS WE TAKE THE ENTIRE FACE OF THE STRIP AND COVER IT WITH GLUE
h8alXw0uBc8_6 0 DEPENDING ON WHICH AGE OF KIDS AND HOW YOU WANT TO WORK THE PROJECT YOU CAN USE A PAINT BRUSH OR YOU CAN HAVE THEM SMEAR THE GLUE WITH THEIR FINGER
h8alXw0uBc8_7 0 AND ONCE THAT'S COVERED THE WHOLE SURFACE OF THE STRIP WE'RE GOING TO LAY THE MATCHSTICKS RIGHT ON TOP
h8alXw0uBc8_8 0 NOW THE MATCHSTICKS DON'T NEED TO BE TRIMMED EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT BE THE EXACT SAME SIZE BUT IF THE MEASUREMENTS THAT WE GAVE WHEN CUTTING THE STRIPS SHOULD BE A NICE FIT FOR THE MATCHSTICKS
h8alXw0uBc8_9 0 AND YOU CAN JUST LAY THEM IN ANY COLOR PATTERN THAT YOU WANT
h8alXw0uBc8_10 0 OF COURSE THERE'S NO SET WAY TO DECORATE THESE STRIPS THAT ARE GOING TO BE THE ARMS OF THE WINDMILL BUT I THINK YOU'LL AGREE THAT ONCE YOU SEE THE FINISHED PROJECT THAT THEY MATCHSTICKS WAS A REALLY NICE COLORFUL CREATIVE WAY TO DECORATE THE WINDMILL
h8alXw0uBc8_11 0 IT GIVES IT A REALLY NICE NICE LOOK AND IT'S A LOT OF FUN FOR KIDS
h8alXw0uBc8_12 0 IT'S AN EASY WAY FOR THEM TO USE THEIR CREATIVE TALENTS TO PICK COLORS AND DECORATE THE ARMS OF THE WINDMILL AND THEY ALWAYS LIKE WORKING WITH GLUE
h8alXw0uBc8_13 0 IT'S ALSO NICE TO USE THE MATCHSTICKS BECAUSE IN THE END WHEN THEY'RE ALL SITTING ON TOP OF THE CORRUGATED STRIPS WE CAN PUT THEM NICE AND STRAIGHT AND EVEN ON THE EDGES
h8alXw0uBc8_14 0 THEY'RE USUALLY PRETTY EVEN SIZED THE WAY THAT WE BUY THEM
h8alXw0uBc8_15 0 SO ALSO THAT GIVES A NICE CLEAN CUT LOOK TO OUR WINDMILL INSTEAD OF USING ANY OTHER TYPES OF DECORATIONS THAT MIGHT LOOK VERY HODGE PODGE
h8alXw0uBc8_16 0 THIS GIVES IT A NICE CLEAN SYMMETRICAL LOOK WHEN WE PUT ALL THE MATCHSTICKS IN PLACE AND MAKE THEM NICE AND EVEN SITTING ON THE CORRUGATED BOX
h8alXw0uBc8_17 0 SO IT'S ALSO AN ADDED LOOK SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE CHOOSING A WAY TO DECORATE THE STRIPS OF YOUR WINDMILL
h8alXw0uBc8_18 0 WE CAN SEE THAT ONCE WE'RE FINISHED THE MATCHSTICKS GIVES US A NICE REAL COLORFUL EFFECT AND WILL LOOK REALLY NICE ON OUR WINDMILL

GoH5ZPL4-0s_1 0 ANOTHER GAME THAT WE LIKE TO PLAY IS CALLED ANACONDA
GoH5ZPL4-0s_2 0 ANACONDA IS A SEVEN CARD GAME
GoH5ZPL4-0s_3 0 IT'S SIMILAR TO SEVEN STUD EXCEPT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CARDS SHOWING
GoH5ZPL4-0s_4 0 ALL CARDS ARE FACE DOWN
GoH5ZPL4-0s_5 0 ANACONDA IS ALSO A SPLIT POT GAME WHERE THE HIGH HAND OR BEST FIVE CARD HAND WILL WIN HALF THE POT AND THE BEST LOW HAND WILL WIN HALF THE POT AS WELL
GoH5ZPL4-0s_6 0 LET'S SEE HOW ANACONDA IS DEALT OUT
GoH5ZPL4-0s_7 0 FIRST THE DEALER WILL DEAL SEVEN CARDS FACE DOWN TO EACH PLAYER
GoH5ZPL4-0s_8 0 ONCE THE SEVEN CARDS ARE DEALT OUT A BETTING REALM WILL FOLLOW
GoH5ZPL4-0s_9 0 AFTER THE BETTING ROUND THE PLAYERS WILL LOOK AT THEIR HANDS AND DECIDE WHICH THREE CARDS THAT THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO GET RID OF
GoH5ZPL4-0s_10 0 THIS IS BASED ON WHETHER OR NOT THEIR HAND IS GOING TO GO FOR A LOW HAND OR A HIGH HAND
GoH5ZPL4-0s_11 0 IN THIS CASE THIS PERSON WOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP THREE CARDS AND ACTUALLY BREAK UP A FLUSH THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE
GoH5ZPL4-0s_12 0 EACH PLAYER WOULD PICK THREE CARDS
GoH5ZPL4-0s_13 0 PASS THEM TO THE LEFT
GoH5ZPL4-0s_14 0 THOSE THREE CARDS ARE PICKED UP BY EACH PLAYER AND ANOTHER BETTING ROUND WILL START
GoH5ZPL4-0s_15 0 ONCE THAT BETTING ROUND IS OVER THEN EACH PLAYER WILL LOOK AT THEIR HAND AND SEE WHICH TWO CARDS THEY WANT TO PASS
GoH5ZPL4-0s_16 0 THEY WILL THEN PASS TWO CARDS
GoH5ZPL4-0s_17 0 THIS PERSON GOT LUCKY AND MADE THEIR FLUSH AGAIN
GoH5ZPL4-0s_18 0 HE'S GOING TO GET RID OF THESE TWO

gX4a7rRzd9k_2 0 WHEN THE BEANS HAVE BEEN BOILING FOR A WHILE AND THE BEANS HAVE OPENED UP A BIT WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE AS MUCH WATER OR AS MUCH LIQUID TO MAKE YOUR RICE
gX4a7rRzd9k_3 0 THE AMOUNT OF LIQUID THAT YOU USE FOR YOUR RICE TO DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH RICE YOU'RE COOKING
gX4a7rRzd9k_4 0 IF THE COOKING TAKES UP TWO CUPS OF RICE THEN YOU WANT TO USE TWO CUPS OF LIQUID YOU DON'T WANT TO USE WATER YOU WANT TO USE ONLY THE DARK LIQUID
gX4a7rRzd9k_5 0 SEE HOW DARK THAT IS
gX4a7rRzd9k_6 0 YOU WANT THAT YOU WANT THAT TO BE NICE AND DARK YOUR RICE SO YOU WANT TWO CUPS OF LIQUID

gwkRV2cjFj4_9 0 SO IT'S VERY EASY
gwkRV2cjFj4_10 0 AGAIN IT'S EMPHASIZING HOW NUMBERS CAN MAKE SHAPES HOW DOTS HELP DIFFERENT OBJECTS BUT IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS CAN MAKE SHAPES AND BASICALLY IT'S FUN

GaD-KlI54ic_2 0 I WOULD USE A CHEAP BRUSH NOTHING NOT A VERY GOOD BRUSH AND YOU CAN START PUSHING THIS AROUND SORT OF LIKE AN INK WASH OR A OR A ANY OTHER FLUID MEDIUM
GaD-KlI54ic_3 0 YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU GET A LOT DARKER WITH THAT THAN YOU CAN GET WITH A STRAIGHT PENCIL LEAD AND YOU CAN ALSO PLAY AROUND WITH THIS LET ME PUT JUST A LITTLE BIT IN HERE
GaD-KlI54ic_4 0 WE'RE JUST GOING TO PLAY AROUND WITH JUST MOVING IT AROUND WITH A BRUSH AND A LITTLE BIT OF ALCOHOL
GaD-KlI54ic_5 0 THIS WON'T WORK SO WELL THIS WON'T WORK WITH WATER
GaD-KlI54ic_6 0 WATER WON'T WORK WITH THIS
GaD-KlI54ic_7 0 YOU REALLY NEED THE ALCOHOL TO SCATTER THE PIGMENT AND THEN WHEN YOUR FINISHED AND EVERYTHING IS DRY
GaD-KlI54ic_8 0 YOU REALLY DO NEED TO TREAT THIS WITH A FIXATIVE A SPRAY FIXATIVE
GaD-KlI54ic_9 0 ALSO THE OTHER THING TO KNOW ABOUT THIS IS THAT YOU CAN NOT ERASE THIS
GaD-KlI54ic_10 0 YOU CAN ERASE THAT AS LONG AS IT'S KEPT DRY
GaD-KlI54ic_11 0 YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ERASE THAT
GaD-KlI54ic_12 0 ONCE YOU'VE SORT OF MIXED IT WITH THE ALCOHOL YOU HAVE LOST YOUR ABILITY TO ERASE
GaD-KlI54ic_13 0 SO YOU HAVE TO KIND OF GO WITH THE FLOW BUT THIS IS GREAT WAY TO START BRINGING FLUIDITY INTO GRAPHITE
GaD-KlI54ic_14 0 IT IS ALSO A WONDERFUL WAY JUST TO GET BEAUTIFUL GRAPHITE WASHES

H82J12zeruU_5 0 THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST DANGEROUS AREA OF THE GAME THAT WE'VE COME ACROSS SO FAR TO HAVE SO MANY BRUTES IN SUCH A SMALL SPACE
H82J12zeruU_6 0 AND YOU'LL SEE THAT AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME THE ENEMIES REALLY START USING THE EQUIPMENT MORE THAN THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST

hCpEtQ0sfJY_1 0 SHIATSU ORIGINATING FROM JAPAN HAS BEEN USED FOR CENTURIES TO TREAT THE ENERGY SYSTEM OF THE BODY FOR HEALTH AND WELLNESS
hCpEtQ0sfJY_2 0 HI MY NAME IS CHRISTINA BJERGO
hCpEtQ0sfJY_3 0 I'M A SHIATSU A JAPANESE MASSAGE PRACTITIONER
hCpEtQ0sfJY_4 0 I'M GOING TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SHIATSU FOR MIGRAINES TO HELP WITH MIGRAINE HEADACHES
hCpEtQ0sfJY_5 0 THE FIRST POINT WE'LL USE TALK ABOUT IN THE WEB BETWEEN THE THUMB AND THE FIRST FINGER IS LARGE INTESTINE FOUR
hCpEtQ0sfJY_6 0 THIS IS A GREAT POINT FOR TREATING OVERALL FOR THE WHOLE HEAD SO NO MATTER WHERE THE PAIN IS ORIGINATING JUST GIVING IT SOME LIGHT OR DEEP MASSAGE CAN BE VERY HELPFUL
hCpEtQ0sfJY_7 0 AND IF THERE ARE POINT AREAS THAT PARTICULARLY FEEL TENDER THAT'S USUALLY A GOOD SIGN YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT LOCATION
hCpEtQ0sfJY_8 0 DOING THE MASSAGE ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS IS A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME TO START AND YOU CAN DO BOTH HANDS
hCpEtQ0sfJY_9 0 THEN FOLLOW IT UP WITH THIS OVER THE WHOLE HEAD
hCpEtQ0sfJY_10 0 WE GO TO THE HEAD AND TREAT SOME LOCATIONS
hCpEtQ0sfJY_11 0 ABOVE THE EYEBROWS GO ABOUT HALF AN INCH THERE'S A LITTLE GROOVE
hCpEtQ0sfJY_12 0 FOR THIS IS PARTICULARLY HELPFUL FOR HEADACHES THAT ARE IN THE FRONTAL AREA AND ALSO THE SIDES
hCpEtQ0sfJY_13 0 SO I LIKE TO DO IS LITTLE CIRCLES IN THIS LOCATION AND JUST CLOSE MY EYES AND RELAX AND WITH THE PRESSURE JUST FEEL THE MUSCLES UNDERNEATH RELAXING FREEING UP CLEARING OF ANY PAIN
hCpEtQ0sfJY_14 0 ANOTHER GREAT ACUPUNCTURE POINT IS THE SIDE OF THE TEMPLES JUST BEHIND THE BONE HERE AROUND THE ORBIT OF THE EYE
hCpEtQ0sfJY_15 0 THIS ONE I DO MORE OF A FLAT SURFACE PRESSURE
hCpEtQ0sfJY_16 0 SOME PEOPLE MIGHT PREFER DEEPER BUT JUST OVERALL KIND OF JUST PRESSURE AND BIGGER CIRCLES AGAIN CLOSING THE EYES AND IF A DARK ROOM IS HELPFUL THAT CAN ALSO BE BENEFICIAL
hCpEtQ0sfJY_17 0 RELAXING THE MUSCLES YOU CAN ALSO USE THE BREATH
hCpEtQ0sfJY_18 0 LET OUT ANY TENSION IN THE HEAD
hCpEtQ0sfJY_19 0 THEN THERE ARE SOME POINTS PARTICULARLY IF THE MIGRAINE IS GOING TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD ABOVE THE EAR
hCpEtQ0sfJY_20 0 GO ABOUT AN INCH ABOVE THE EAR APPLYING PRESSURE HERE PARTICULARLY IF IT FEELS GOOD TO APPLY PRESSURE AND MOVING AROUND THE EAR
hCpEtQ0sfJY_21 0 THIS HELPS GET SOME OF THE MIGRAINE HEADACHES THAT ALSO ARE IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD OR THE OXIPUT
hCpEtQ0sfJY_22 0 AND THAT'S IT TODAY FROM ACUPRESSURE POINTS THAT YOU CAN USE BEFORE AND ALSO DURING MIGRAINE HEADACHES TO HELP
HE7qWZZ4sPw_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS DR SUSAN JEWELL
HE7qWZZ4sPw_2 0 IN THIS CLIP WE WOULD ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SIGNS AND THE SYMPTOMS OF A PERSON WHO MIGHT BE EXPERIENCING THIS PARTICULAR CONDITION CALLED THE MALE MENOPAUSE OR ANDROPAUSE
HE7qWZZ4sPw_3 0 NOW WHAT WOULD THEY COME IN COMPLAINING ABOUT
HE7qWZZ4sPw_4 0 WELL MOST PATIENTS ONE %PERCENT OF THE MALE THAT COME IN WITH THE SO CALL MALE MENOPAUSE/ANDROPAUSE WHICH SAY THEY COMPLAIN OF SEXUAL DESIRE
HE7qWZZ4sPw_5 0 OTHER SCIENTIFIC SYMPTOMS THEY COME IN SAY THERE BREAST ARE SWOLLEN OR IT IS VERY TENDER TO TOUCH
HE7qWZZ4sPw_6 0 THIS PROBLEM DOES NOT GO AWAY IT IS THERE ALL THE TIME
HE7qWZZ4sPw_7 0 THEY ALSO SAY THAT THEY HAVE IT IS VERY SIMILAR TO FEMALES WHO GO INTO MENOPAUSE OR ARE IN MENOPAUSE THAT THEY HAVE A PERIODS OF HOT FLASHES AND SWEATING WHICH ARE EPISODES
HE7qWZZ4sPw_8 0 ALSO ON TOP OF THAT THEY WOULD COMPLAIN OF THIS LACK OF ENERGY AND JUST DO FEEL THAT THEY WANT TO DO ANYTHING
HE7qWZZ4sPw_9 0 THEY LOSE THE PASSION FOR LIFE
HE7qWZZ4sPw_10 0 YOU NOW GRADUAL IT IS A GRADUAL SIGN SO ABOUT ONE %PERCENT OF THE MEN WOULD SHOW THIS
HE7qWZZ4sPw_11 0 IT IS KIND OF RELATED TO THE CONDITION THAT YOU WOULD FIND IN ANDROPAUSE OR MALE MENOPAUSE
gJR9CuXLjIw_1 0 HI WERE TALKING ON COPPER FOILING TODAY AND WERE GOING TO BE MAKING A SUN CATCHER LATER BUT I WOULD LIKE TO LET YOU KNOW THERE'S A DIFFERENT AESTHETIC FEEL AND LOOK THAT YOU CAN HAVE FOR EACH OF YOUR PROJECTS AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS YOUR PATINA
gJR9CuXLjIw_2 0 THERE IS A PATINA THAT CAN BE USED ON YOUR SAUDER YOUR LEAD AND ALSO YOUR ZINC AND THERE'S DIFFERENT COLORS THAT ARE AVAILABLE
gJR9CuXLjIw_3 0 THERE'S A BLACK A BROWN A GREEN
gJR9CuXLjIw_4 0 WERE GOING TO BE USING THE BLACK
gJR9CuXLjIw_5 0 WHAT THE PATINA DOES IS ITS TAKES YOUR SILVER SAUDER COLOR THAT YOU HAVE AND IT WILL TURN IT TO A NICE BLACK COLOR LIKE IN THIS
gJR9CuXLjIw_6 0 FOR INSTANCE AND THE WAY THAT THIS PROCESS WORKS IS FIRST OF ALL YOU WOULD TAKE A LITTLE STEEL WOOL OR SCOURING PAD AND YOU WOULD SCRAPE OVER YOUR SAUDERED PART LIKE THAT JUST TO GET ROUGHED UP A LITTLE BIT ENOUGH FOR YOU TO APPLY YOUR PATINA AND THEN YOU WOULD TAKE YOUR PATINA POUR YOURSELF JUST A LITTLE BIT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO NEED MUCH
gJR9CuXLjIw_7 0 YOU CAN ALWAYS POUR OUT MORE AS YOU NEED AND YOU HAVE THIS LITTLE PIECE OF A SPONGE
gJR9CuXLjIw_8 0 TAKE YOUR SPONGE AND YOU ACTUALLY APPLY IT ONTO YOUR PANEL
gJR9CuXLjIw_9 0 NOW I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT ON THIS PIECE BECAUSE IT'S SOMEONE ELSE'S PIECE THAT THEIR WORKING ON BUT IT WOULD TURN THIS BLACK AND AS YOU GO AHEAD A PLACE YOUR PATINA UPON YOUR SAUDER YOU WOULD ALSO HAVE A DRYER AVAILABLE WHICH YOU WOULD HEAT UP THE PATINA ON YOUR SAUDER OR YOUR ZINC OR YOUR LEAD WHICHEVER YOU'RE USING IT ON
gJR9CuXLjIw_10 0 WHICHEVER PROJECT THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON AND WHAT IT INQUIRES AND IT WILL TURN IT TO THE COLOR OF PATINA THAT YOU HAVE SELECTED WHETHER IT BE BLACK BROWN OR GREEN
GPj4NmEDoHE_1 0 TYPES OF THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH A PUPPY AS FAR AS GETTING THEM COMPLETELY HOUSE TRAINED
GPj4NmEDoHE_2 0 IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY AND SO YOU'VE GOT TO USE PATIENCE AND KIND OF STICK IN THERE
GPj4NmEDoHE_3 0 IT COULD TAKE QUITE SOME TIME AND BE REALISTIC ABOUT IT
GPj4NmEDoHE_4 0 THESE GUYS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE REALLY YOUNG CAN NOT LEARN HOUSE TRAINING OVER NIGHT
GPj4NmEDoHE_5 0 IT CAN TAKE DAYS TO WEEKS SOMETIMES FOR THESE GUYS TO FIGURE IT OUT
GPj4NmEDoHE_6 0 THE FIRST THING USUALLY THAT'S EASY TO DO WHEN YOU TRY TO HOUSE TRAIN A PUPPY IS GET THEM TO RECOGNIZE WHAT THEY CAN GO ON IN THE HOUSEHOLD LIKE EVERYDAY NEWSPAPER WORKS VERY WELL
GPj4NmEDoHE_7 0 THEY ALSO SELL PEE PEE PADS AT PET STORES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
GPj4NmEDoHE_8 0 SO BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE REALLY YOUNG THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE GOING TO IMMEDIATELY START GOING OUTSIDE AND SO IF THEY ARE GOING INSIDE GET THEM TO TRY TO GO ON A NEWSPAPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
GPj4NmEDoHE_9 0 IF THEY DEFECATE TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT AND PUT IT ON NEWSPAPER OR GET A LITTLE BIT OF URINE AND PUT ON THERE IF YOU CAN SOAK A LITTLE URINE OFF OF THE NEWSPAPER AND THEN THEY'LL GET THAT SCENT AND START FIGURING IT OUT
GPj4NmEDoHE_10 0 THE FIRST OTHER THING SECOND OTHER THING YOU NEED TO DO THEN IS START GETTING THEM TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUTSIDE IS WHERE THEY NEED TO GO
GPj4NmEDoHE_11 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO USE NEWSPAPER FOR VERY LONG BECAUSE IT CONFUSES THEM AND MAKES THEM THINK OH IT'S OKAY TO GO INSIDE
GPj4NmEDoHE_12 0 YOU CAN START MOVING THE PAPER OUTSIDE OR ONE EASY THING TO DO IS ALWAYS TAKE A LITTLE TREAT WITH YOU OUTSIDE AND THEN JUST PLAY WITH THEM OUT THERE WHEN THEY DO GO YOU WANT TO PRAISE THEM AND YOU WANT TO TREAT THEM IMMEDIATELY RIGHT WHEN THEY GO BECAUSE YOU WANT TO ASSOCIATE THAT WITH SOMETHING REALLY POSITIVE
GPj4NmEDoHE_13 0 IF THEY GO ON THE INSIDE OF THE HOUSE YOU CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING EXCEPT IF YOU'RE CATCHING THEM RIGHT THERE JUST LET THEM KNOW NO AND LET THEM KNOW THAT'S A NEGATIVE THING TO DO
GPj4NmEDoHE_14 0 AND SO IT TAKES A WHILE BUT KEEP IN THERE AND USE POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT ESPECIALLY OUTSIDE AND THEY WILL LEARN

hCUQvwxzLww_1 0 SO HOW DO YOU MAKE TEA WITH A CAST IRON TEA POT ALSO KNOWN AS A TETSUBIN
hCUQvwxzLww_2 0 THESE ARE ORIGINALLY JAPANESE
hCUQvwxzLww_3 0 THEY HOLD TEA VERY HOT FOR QUITE A WHILE
hCUQvwxzLww_4 0 IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO TAKE TIME DRINKING THEIR TEAM AND YOU LIKE YOUR TEA TO REMAIN HOT THROUGHOUT THAT TIME CAST IRON IS THE BEST CHOICE
hCUQvwxzLww_5 0 IT COMES IN MANY SIZES COLORS AND SUCH
hCUQvwxzLww_6 0 THE CAST IRON STARTED OFF BEING A TEA KETTLE
hCUQvwxzLww_7 0 WHAT THEY DO IS THEY PUT IT OVER A STOVE TOP AND BOIL WATER WITH IT
hCUQvwxzLww_8 0 BUT THROUGH TIME IT CHANGES IN COLORS IT ALSO CHANGES IN SIZES TO SOMETHING THAT IS MORE INDIVIDUAL AND NOW IT MADE ITS WAY TO THE TEA TABLE WHERE YOU'RE USING IT TO SERVE TEA
hCUQvwxzLww_9 0 USING A CAST IRON TEA POT IS THE SAME WAY YOU USE ANY OTHER TEA POT
hCUQvwxzLww_10 0 THERE IS A TEA FILTER INSIDE YOU PUT IT IN AND THEN YOU PUT IN YOUR TEA LEAVES
hCUQvwxzLww_11 0 YOU TAKE A TEA SCOOPER PUT IN THE AMOUNT OF TEA THAT YOU LIKE TO MAKE AND THEN YOU PUT HOT WATER INTO YOUR TEA POT LIKE SO AND YOU LET IT SIT INSIDE THE TEA POT FOR THREE TO FIVE MINUTES AND AFTER IT IS READY YOU POUR IT INTO A TEA CUP AND THEN YOU ARE READY TO GO
hCUQvwxzLww_12 0 AFTER YOU ARE DONE WITH YOUR TEA YOU SIMPLY PUT THE TEA BASKET BACK IN AND THEN POUR MORE HOT WATER AND MAKE THE TEA LEAVES AGAIN AND YOU GET A SECOND POT
H9diw26ilbs_1 0 STRETCHING OUT THE ABDOMINAL IS REALLY IMPORTANT AFTER YOU'VE WORKED THEM AND IT HELPS TO RELIEVE ANY KIND OF BUILDUP OF LACTIC ACIDS SO THAT YOU WON'T BE AS SORE THE NEXT DAY
H9diw26ilbs_2 0 A REALLY GOOD ABDOMINAL STRETCH IS TO BRING YOUR ARMS OVER YOUR HEAD GO AHEAD AND POINT YOUR FEET STRETCH YOUR ARMS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AND STRETCH YOUR FEET
H9diw26ilbs_3 0 AND THEN YOU CAN FLEX YOUR FEET PUSHING THE HEELS OUT AND AGAIN STRETCHING YOUR ARMS
H9diw26ilbs_4 0 THERE'S ALSO WHAT'S CALLED AN X STRETCH WHERE YOU BRING YOUR ARMS OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT OVER SHOULDER POSITION AND YOUR FEET IS GOING TO BE OUT A LITTLE BIT WIDER TO THEN YOU'RE GOING TO STRETCH WITH THE RIGHT HAND AND THE LEFT LEG BRINGING THAT IN EXHALE STRETCH WITH THE RIGHT LEG LEFT HAND BRING THAT IN ONE MORE TIME STRETCH WITH THE OPPOSITES AND BRING IT IN AND STRETCH WITH THE OPPOSITES AND BRING IT IN LEGS COME TOGETHER ARMS COME TOGETHER ONE MORE ABDOMINAL STRETCH REACH AS FAR AS YOU CAN AND BRING THE ARMS IN AND DOWN
H9diw26ilbs_5 0 WHEN YOU'RE DOING STRETCHES YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER THE SHOULDERS REACH UP OR ANY KIND OF POSTURAL WHERE YOUR HEAD IS OTHER THAN TO MAKE SURE IT'S STILL SUPPORTED SO THAT IT'S NOT IN AN EXTENDED POSITION
HbPH54fD5y8_1 0 HI I'M DANNY PAGE AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
HbPH54fD5y8_2 0 IN THIS SERIES I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO DRAW A BASIC CARTOON CHARACTERS
HbPH54fD5y8_3 0 ALRIGHT SO STARTING OUT THE BLANK PAGE
HbPH54fD5y8_4 0 WHEN THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING DOWN ON PAPER AND THERE'S NOTHING BUT YOUR IDEAS IN YOUR HEAD AND YOU'RE STARING AT THE PAGE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT TO MAKE YOUR IDEAS A REALITY OR MAYBE YOU JUST FEEL LIKE GOOFING AROUND AND JUST SKETCHING AND SEEING WHAT IDEAS FLOW FROM THE TIP OF YOUR PEN ON TO THE PAGE
HbPH54fD5y8_5 0 SO IN THIS INSTANCE THOUGH THE FIRST THING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS CHOOSE A TYPE OF PEN THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE SKETCHING WITH
HbPH54fD5y8_6 0 IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO BE USING THE FINE TIPPED SHARPIE WHICH IS GOOD FOR THESE TYPES OF DEMONSTRATIONS CAUSE YOU CAN REALLY SEE THE INK PRETTY WELL BUT I WILL TELL YOU THOUGH IF YOU'RE USING A SKETCH PAD THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF PRECIOUS DRAWINGS ON IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA TO USE SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT LESS POWERFUL BECAUSE THIS WILL BLEED LIKE CRAZY THROUGH THE PAGES
HbPH54fD5y8_7 0 SO EITHER MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A SAFETY PAGE BLOCKING THE CURRENT PAGE YOU'RE DRAWING ON FROM THE OTHER PAGES OR USE A PEN THAT'S NOT QUITE AS CRAZY POWERFUL
HbPH54fD5y8_8 0 THIS IS THE ONE I'LL BE USING FOR THE DEMONSTRATION
HbPH54fD5y8_9 0 HOWEVER MOST FOLKS WHEN THEIR SKETCHING EARLY IDEAS OUT PREFER TO GO WITH SOMETHING A LITTLE LESS PERMANENT LIKE A PENCIL WITH AN ERASER
HbPH54fD5y8_10 0 THE ERASER CAN OBVIOUSLY HELP YOU CHANGE LITTLE MISTAKES THAT YOU'RE BOUND TO MAKE AS YOU'RE CRAFTING YOUR IDEA AND THEN SOME FOLKS MORE PROFESSIONAL FOLKS WHO ARE LITTLE LESS AFRAID OF MAKING MISTAKES GO FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE FINE TIP
HbPH54fD5y8_11 0 THIS IS ALSO A SHARPIE BUT THE TIP IS MUCH MORE FINE AND YOU CAN GET IN THERE AND REALLY MAKE SOME A LIT BIT MORE INTRICATE DETAILS
HbPH54fD5y8_12 0 SOMETHING A LITTLE LESS BROAD AND THESE ARE MORE FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A WHILE AND CAN SKETCH AND THE IDEAS FLOW FREELY
HbPH54fD5y8_13 0 SO THIS ONE IS A LITTLE LESS SAFE BUT A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAILED
HbPH54fD5y8_14 0 BUT FOR THESE PURPOSES I'M GOING TO GO WITH THIS ONE THE BROAD SHARPIE AND THIS ONE'S KIND OF COOL TOO
HbPH54fD5y8_16 0 YOU DON'T SEE THOSE TOO OFTEN
HbPH54fD5y8_17 0 YOU CAN PICK THEM UP AT ANY LOCAL TARGET OR WAL-MART
HbPH54fD5y8_18 0 ALRIGHT SO HERE WE GO
HdDPAe23QK8_1 0 ANOTHER THING THAT SOMETIMES WORKS WITH DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR STUDENTS IS TO PUT THEM IN GROUPS
HdDPAe23QK8_2 0 HAVE STUDENTS WORK IN GROUPS AND IF YOU HAVE A CLUSTER OF STUDENTS WHO TEND TO BE DISRUPTIVE YOU DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT THEM WORKING TOGETHER OR MAYBE YOU DEFINITELY DO AND I'LL TELL YOU THE TWO REASONS WHY
HdDPAe23QK8_3 0 IF YOU SPLIT THEM UP AND YOU'VE ASSIGNED GROUPS AROUND THE CLASSROOM AND YOU'VE SPLIT THE DISRUPTIVE STUDENTS UP
HdDPAe23QK8_4 0 THOSE STUDENTS HAVE TO HAVE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY IN THEIR NEW GROUP
HdDPAe23QK8_5 0 THE NEW GROUP MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT THEIR LITTLE BUDDIES IN THE CLASS WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO PARTICIPATE
HdDPAe23QK8_6 0 ENCOURAGE THEM NOT TO BE DISRUPTIVE
HdDPAe23QK8_7 0 ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO GOOD WORK BECAUSE THAT'S THE STANDARD OF THE GROUP OR YOU CAN TAKE A DIFFERENT TACTIC AND YOU CAN LET ALL THE DISRUPTIVE STUDENTS WORK TOGETHER AND IF THERE'S A TIME LIMIT ON THE ACTIVITY NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN THEY WON'T MAKE IT SO EVERY OTHER GROUP GETS AN A BECAUSE THEY WERE DOING THEIR WORK AND THE DISRUPTIVE GROUP GETS A D BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T PREPARED AND SO THAT IS ALWAYS AN OPTION IS TO PLACE THEM INTO GROUPS
gs4LfF3KspA_1 0 MY NAME IS BRANDON SARKIN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gs4LfF3KspA_2 0 TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE TURKEY SOUP OUT OF LEFTOVER HOLIDAY TURKEYS

gs4LfF3KspA_6 0 IT'S GOING TO LOOK A LOT MORE BARE
gs4LfF3KspA_7 0 YOU CAN SEE HOW SOME OF THE MEAT IS STILL HANGING ON THERE
gs4LfF3KspA_8 0 YOU CAN JUST GRAB IT WITH THESE TONGS JUST LIKE THAT
gs4LfF3KspA_9 0 THIS SHOULD JUST FALL RIGHT OFF WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT IT TO DO
gs4LfF3KspA_10 0 GRAB THAT LITTLE PIECE GRAB THAT THERE'S A LITTLE PIECE OF SKIN THERE GRAB THAT
gs4LfF3KspA_11 0 THAT'S PRETTY CLEAN LOOKING COMPARED TO HOW IT WENT IN
gs4LfF3KspA_12 0 LET'S ALSO GRAB THAT PIECE
gs4LfF3KspA_13 0 THERE'S THE WISHBONE
gs4LfF3KspA_14 0 YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO WATCH OUT BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL YOU WILL END UP WITH A BONE OR TWO IN HERE
gs4LfF3KspA_15 0 SOME OF THE RIB BONES WILL PROBABLY FALL OUT ON THEIR OWN
gs4LfF3KspA_16 0 JUST BE AWARE OF THAT WHEN YOU GO TO SERVE IT
gs4LfF3KspA_17 0 BEFORE SERVING GO THROUGH IT VERY CAREFULLY TO PULL ALL THE BONES OUT IF THERE ARE ANY IN THERE
gs4LfF3KspA_18 0 THAT LOOKS LIKE THE BACK WHICH IT IS
gs4LfF3KspA_19 0 THERE WAS A GOOD PIECE OF MEAT STUCK TO THAT SO I'LL PUT THAT BACK IN THERE
gs4LfF3KspA_20 0 I PROBABLY DON'T WANT THIS BIG PIECE OF SKIN IN THERE
gs4LfF3KspA_21 0 IT HAS SERVED ITS PURPOSE
gs4LfF3KspA_22 0 USUALLY YOU CAN JUST SHAKE THE PIECE OF BONE AND ANY OF THE MEAT THAT'S ON THERE JUST FALLS RIGHT OFF JUST LIKE THAT
gs4LfF3KspA_23 0 OBVIOUSLY THIS IS VERY VERY HOT SO YOU WANT TO BE CAREFUL THAT YOU DON'T BURN YOURSELF WHEN YOU DO THIS
gs4LfF3KspA_24 0 HERE'S THE LARGE PART OF THE CARCASS THAT'S STILL IN HERE
gs4LfF3KspA_25 0 WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GRAB THIS WHOLE THING AND I CAN PULL IT OUT AND PICK THE MEAT OFF OF THERE AND ADD IT BACK IN LATER AS I SEE FIT
gs4LfF3KspA_26 0 THERE'S ANOTHER BONE THAT'S ACTUALLY THE NECK
gs4LfF3KspA_27 0 WE'RE GOING TO PULL THE WHOLE NECK OUT BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO EAT THAT
gs4LfF3KspA_28 0 IT'S JUST IN THERE FOR FLAVORING
gs4LfF3KspA_29 0 ALTHOUGH IF YOU WANT TO EAT IT FEEL FREE TO LEAVE IT IN THERE
gs4LfF3KspA_30 0 THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THIS STEP
gs4LfF3KspA_31 0 THERE YOU HAVE THAT
Gtm13n0R0O4_1 0 WHEN THEY ARE IN THE BATH TUB OR YOU'RE TAKING A BATH THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS TO CONSIDER
Gtm13n0R0O4_2 0 FIRST OF ALL IS WATER TEMPERATURE
Gtm13n0R0O4_3 0 THE HOTTER THE WATER THE MORE LIKELY THERE'S GOING TO BE A REACTION WITH YOUR ECZEMA
Gtm13n0R0O4_4 0 IT CAN CAUSE VERY BAD ITCHINESS ON YOUR SKIN RED IN YOUR SKIN
Gtm13n0R0O4_5 0 THE HEAT GETS TRAPPED IN YOUR BODY FROM THE HOT WATER AND IT CAN SPARK A FLARE UP
Gtm13n0R0O4_6 0 SO WHAT YOU YOUR BEST BET IS TO USE A LUKEWARM BATH AND NOT STAY IN IT TOO LONG
Gtm13n0R0O4_7 0 DOCTORS RECOMMEND FIVE TEN MINUTES FOR A BATH
Gtm13n0R0O4_8 0 WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH SENSITIVE SKIN ESPECIALLY IF YOU DO HAVE AN ECZEMA FLARE UP YOU DON'T WANT TO USE ANYTHING TO RUB AGAINST THE SKIN
Gtm13n0R0O4_9 0 SO USING A WASH CLOTH IS NOT A GOOD IDEA
Gtm13n0R0O4_10 0 INSTEAD JUST PUT THE CLEANSER ON YOUR HAND AND USE THAT TO WIPE OVER YOUR BODY OR TO CLEANSE YOURSELF
Gtm13n0R0O4_11 0 THAT WAY YOU WON'T HAVE ANY REACTION OR ANY KIND OF ABRASION ON THE SKIN BECAUSE WHAT THE ECZEMA DOES ONCE YOU START SCRATCHING IT YOU'RE CREATING LITTLE ABRASIONS IN YOUR SKIN SCRATCHES THAT MAKE YOUR SKIN EVEN ITCHIER WHICH MAKES YOU WANT TO SCRATCH IT MORE
Gtm13n0R0O4_12 0 AND WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE SCRATCHES AND YOU KEEP ITCHING IT IT WON'T HEAL AND IT USUALLY WILL LEAD TO SOME KIND OF AN INFECTION
GaX_zYNUVTQ_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS PAUL ANDERSON FROM THE ABC CIRCUS HERE IN HOLLYWOOD FLORIDA AND WE'RE GOING TO DO HOW TO BE A CLOWN

gY2MSxD4-s4_1 0 OKAY IN THE LAST SEGMENT WE LEARNED THAT USING ENGLISH DOES NOT HELP US CONTROL THE DIRECTION THAT A CUE BALL COMES OFF OF AN OBJECT BALL AT AN ANGLE
gY2MSxD4-s4_2 0 THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO SET UP THE SAME SHOT SAME WAY AND WE'RE GOING TO HIT IT WITH ENGLISH AS WE DID THE LAST THREE TIMES
gY2MSxD4-s4_3 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO HIT IT ONE TIME WITHOUT ANY ENGLISH
gY2MSxD4-s4_4 0 BUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR THIS TIME IS WHAT ANGLE DOES THE CUE BALL COME OFF OF THE CUSHION
gY2MSxD4-s4_5 0 AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE CLUE
gY2MSxD4-s4_6 0 THIS IS WHERE ENGLISH IS USED
gY2MSxD4-s4_7 0 YOU USE ENGLISH TO CONTROL THE ANGLES THAT A BALL COMES OFF OF A CUSHION NOT THE ANGLES THAT IT COMES OFF OF ANOTHER BALL
gY2MSxD4-s4_8 0 SO LET'S GO BACK TO THIS SHOT ONCE AGAIN HIT IT WITH NO ENGLISH AND WE'RE GOING TO HIT IT JUST LIKE THAT GOES OVER TO OUR SPOT AND WE SEE THAT IT GIVES US AN ANGLE THAT COMES OFF ROUGHLY THE SAME AS THE ANGLE THAT IT WENT IN
gY2MSxD4-s4_9 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS SHOT AND WE'RE GOING TO USE LEFT HAND ENGLISH AND IT SHOULD COME RIGHT OVER PRETTY MUCH TO THAT SAME PIECE OF CHALK
gY2MSxD4-s4_10 0 BUT WATCH WHAT ANGLE IT COMES OFF AT THIS TIME
gY2MSxD4-s4_11 0 COMES OFF WAY OVER HERE
gY2MSxD4-s4_12 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO USE THAT SAME SETUP GOING TO USE LEFT HAND ENGLISH THIS TIME
gY2MSxD4-s4_13 0 I MEAN RIGHT HAND ENGLISH I'M SORRY
gY2MSxD4-s4_14 0 NOW CAME OFF STRAIGHTER
gY2MSxD4-s4_15 0 SO HERE WE HAD IT COME OFF THIS WAY WITH NO ENGLISH THIS WAY WITH RIGHT HAND ENGLISH AND THIS WAY WITH LEFT HAND ENGLISH
gY2MSxD4-s4_16 0 SO WE'RE CHANGING THE ANGLE THAT IT COMES OFF OF A CUSHION AND WE'RE DOING THAT FOR POSITIONING PURPOSES
h5jC24uGHyo_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUTFITTING YOUR RAFT LET'S LOOK AT HOW THIS RAFT'S OUTFITTED HERE
h5jC24uGHyo_2 0 THE CHICKEN LINES THAT RUN ALONG THE OUTSIDE OF THE RAFT IF YOU ARE ON THE WAY OUT OF THE BOAT FOR ANY REASON YOU CAN GRAB HOLD OF THIS AND THAT KEEPS YOU CLOSE TO THE RAFT AND HOPEFULLY YOUR CREW CAN PULL YOU BACK IN
h5jC24uGHyo_3 0 ALSO IF YOU'RE RAFTING AND YOU'RE SITTING INSIDE THE RAFT IF YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE YOU CAN HOLD ON THE OUTSIDE AND HOLD ON THE INSIDE TOO AND THAT WAY YOU HAVE A PRETTY SECURE SPOT IN THE BOAT
h5jC24uGHyo_4 0 THESE WE HAVE INSIDE THE PORTS SO YOU CAN HOLD ON WHEN YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE WATER AND HAVE THEM UPFRONT TOO
h5jC24uGHyo_5 0 USED TO HAVE A BOW LINE OR STERN LINE WE TEND TO HAVE MOST OF OUR BOATS OUTFITTED WITH A STERN LINE WHICH IS RIGHT ON THE BACK OF THE BOAT HERE
h5jC24uGHyo_6 0 THIS IS TUCKED UP ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOAT OUT OF THE WAY SO THAT THERE ARE LESS ENTRAPMENT POSSIBILITIES
h5jC24uGHyo_7 0 THE STERN LINE IS USUALLY ABOUT THE LENGTH OF THE BOAT AND IT'S USED TO TIE THE RAFT UP WHENEVER YOU STOP
h5jC24uGHyo_8 0 AND THEN YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR OARS PUT IT BACK AWAY SO IT'S OUT OF THE WAY SO YOU'RE NOT DRAGGING THE LINE
h5jC24uGHyo_9 0 YOU CAN DAISY CHAIN THE ROPE SO THAT IT'S OUT OF YOUR WAY AND THERE'S LESS
H5AZWktsnYs_1 0 NOW I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU A CLASSIC
H5AZWktsnYs_2 0 THIS IS CALLED POLE LASHING
H5AZWktsnYs_3 0 ITS A GREAT WAY IF YOU WANT TO BIND TOGETHER A BUNCH OF STICKS OR AN ITEM METAL ITEMS TOOLS OR WHATEVER
H5AZWktsnYs_4 0 AS YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THE TABLE I'M GOING TO USE MY LASHING TO BIND TOGETHER HERE A COUPLE OF MY ARTIST TOOLS HERE A COUPLE OF PAINT BRUSHES A PENCIL AND A MARKER
H5AZWktsnYs_5 0 THERE THEY GO TRYING TO GET AWAY SO I NEED TO LASH THEM BEFORE THEY RUN OFF MY TABLE
H5AZWktsnYs_6 0 SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO TAKE MY LENGTH OF ROPE THAT I HAVE HERE
H5AZWktsnYs_7 0 I'M GOING TO BRING IT UNDER MY ITEMS
H5AZWktsnYs_8 0 AND THEN AROUND OVER LIKE SO
H5AZWktsnYs_9 0 AND I'M GOING TO PULL OUT A LITTLE MORE LENGTH
H5AZWktsnYs_10 0 THERE WE GO
H5AZWktsnYs_11 0 AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO TAKE IT AND I'M GOING TO PULL A BITE UNDERNEATH THE REST OF MY WORKING END
H5AZWktsnYs_12 0 AND WE'LL PULL IT OVER AND THROUGH LIKE THIS
H5AZWktsnYs_13 0 AND AS YOU CAN SEE THIS CREATES ALMOST AN S SHAPE AROUND THIS
H5AZWktsnYs_14 0 AS I PULL THIS TIGHT THIS WILL BIND THESE
H5AZWktsnYs_15 0 NOW THIS REALLY ISN'T ENOUGH TO BIND THEM TOGETHER
H5AZWktsnYs_16 0 SO TO FINISH THIS OUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TIE A REGULAR HALF NOT INTO IT
H5AZWktsnYs_17 0 LETS PUSH THIS TOGETHER TO MAKE IT LOOK A LITTLE BETTER
H5AZWktsnYs_18 0 AND WE TIE A LITTLE HALF KNOT INTO IT
H5AZWktsnYs_19 0 AND WE'LL FINISH THIS OFF BY TYING A REEF KNOT INTO IT
H5AZWktsnYs_20 0 AND THERE WE GO
H5AZWktsnYs_21 0 A NICE SIMPLE POLE LASHING
ge8vT9DsruU_1 0 HI CHRIS COBB FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
ge8vT9DsruU_2 0 IT'S BEEN A COUPLE HOURS
ge8vT9DsruU_5 0 SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK
ge8vT9DsruU_6 0 SO WE ARE ON OUR FINAL BREAK DOWN SHEET
ge8vT9DsruU_7 0 TAKE A LOOK TO SEE HOW MANY BREAK DOWN SHEETS IT TAKES
ge8vT9DsruU_8 0 ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN SHEETS FOR ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN SCENES
ge8vT9DsruU_9 0 NOW I DON'T ALWAYS BREAK DOWN A SHEET PER SCENE BUT I DID THIS TIME TO SHOW THE MOST STRAIGHT FORWARD WAY TO DO IT
ge8vT9DsruU_10 0 ALL THE INFORMATION WE EXPECT IS THERE
ge8vT9DsruU_11 0 INTERIOR SPACE NEEDLE NIGHT FOUR EIGHTHS OF A PAGE SYNOPSIS AND A LOT OF CAST MEMBERS
ge8vT9DsruU_12 0 SO THE NEXT STEP FOR US IS TO GO TO THE STRIP BOARD OR PRODUCTION BOARDS AS YOU'LL HERE ME CALL IT
ge8vT9DsruU_13 0 WE KNOW HOW TO DO THAT
ge8vT9DsruU_14 0 WE'LL GO UP TO SCHEDULE AND SELECT STRIP BOARD
ge8vT9DsruU_15 0 HOWEVER THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO GO ABOUT IT AND LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT THAT IS
ge8vT9DsruU_16 0 SEE THIS SCREEN COLOR REMEMBER WHAT THAT STANDS FOR
ge8vT9DsruU_17 0 STANDS FOR INTERIOR NIGHT
ge8vT9DsruU_18 0 REMEMBER WHEN WE DESIGNED OUR STRIP COLORS WE CREATED THEM HERE INTERIOR NIGHT AND THERE IT IS THAT GREEN
ge8vT9DsruU_19 0 IF THIS WAS A EXTERIOR NIGHT THIS IT WOULD BE BLUE
ge8vT9DsruU_20 0 LET ME SHOW YOU
ge8vT9DsruU_21 0 YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY NOTICED THIS AS YOU WE'RE BREAKING DOWN THE SCRIPT BUT JUST GO THROUGH IT JUST TO EMPHASIZE THE POINT
ge8vT9DsruU_22 0 THERE IT IS BLUE AND IF I SELECT IE IT WOULD BE GRAY AND TBD FOR INSTANCE IS THAT FUCHSIA COLOR WHICH SHOWS
ge8vT9DsruU_25 0 SO LET'S GO BACK UP
ge8vT9DsruU_27 0 SO THIS COLOR REPRESENTS THE COLOR OF THE STRIP BUT NOT ONLY THAT IT REPRESENTS THE STRIP ITSELF
ge8vT9DsruU_28 0 SO GO AHEAD AND CLICK IT
ge8vT9DsruU_30 0 THERE WE ARE

gUW-e1Z0qVY_1 0 HI I'M TIM GIPSON AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO GREEN CLEAN YOUR DRAINS
gUW-e1Z0qVY_2 0 NOW IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO MAINTAIN YOUR DRAINS BUT YOU DON'T ALWAYS WANT TO USE HARSH CHEMICALS SO THERE ARE SOME GOOD OLD GRANDMA RECIPES THAT YOU CAN USE
gUW-e1Z0qVY_3 0 JUST WITH HOUSEHOLD ITEMS THAT YOU HAVE AROUND
gUW-e1Z0qVY_4 0 SO IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE'RE GOING TO BE USING BAKING SODA SALT AND CLEAR VINEGAR
gUW-e1Z0qVY_5 0 AND THEN ALSO BOILING WATER
gUW-e1Z0qVY_6 0 AND YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO WHETHER YOU HAVE A CLOG OR WHETHER YOU JUST WANT TO DO THIS PERIODICALLY
gUW-e1Z0qVY_7 0 SAY ONCE A MONTH OR ONCE EVERY TWO MONTHS
gUW-e1Z0qVY_8 0 FIRST THING WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO MAKE UP MIX UP SOME BAKING SODA WITH JUST A LITTLE BIT OF WATER AND WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS WHERE IT IS FAIRLY THICK WHERE IT'S JUST ENOUGH TO POUR
gUW-e1Z0qVY_9 0 AND THEN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS BAKING SODA MIXTURE AND WE'RE GOING TO POUR IT DOWN THE SINK AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THAT UP WITH A CUP OF THE VINEGAR AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO LET THAT SET FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES CAUSE YOU WANT TO GET DOWN IN THERE AND YOU WANT TO WORK IN THOSE PIPES
gUW-e1Z0qVY_10 0 BUT THE VINEGAR AND THE BAKING SODA IT WOULD ACTUALLY CREATE A FOAMING ACTION WHICH WE'LL GET DOWN THERE AND ACTUALLY GET OUT AROUND AND CLEAR UP THAT GUNK THAT ACTUALLY COATS THE INSIDE OF THE PIPE
gUW-e1Z0qVY_11 0 OKAY SO ONCE WE LET THAT SIT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A CUP OF SALT AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT INTO A POT OF WATER WE'RE GOING TO BOIL THIS SO WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A POT OF BOILING BRINE
gUW-e1Z0qVY_12 0 SO ONCE THIS IS SET FOR TEN MINUTES THEN WE'LL SIMPLY POUR THE BOILING WATER DOWN AND THEN AFTER WE'VE DONE ALL THAT THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO JUST RUN THE HOT TAP WATER AND RUN THIS FOR ABOUT THREE TO FIVE MINUTES JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE HAD TIME TO CLEAR EVERYTHING OUT
gUW-e1Z0qVY_13 0 AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT
gUW-e1Z0qVY_14 0 SO I'M TIM GIPSON AND THOSE ARE SOME TIPS ON HOW TO GREEN CLEAN YOUR DRAINS
H17KsbZ3IvQ_1 0 HI THIS IS RICHARD BUCCOLA IN NEW YORK CITY AND TODAY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE MUSHROOM FRITTERS
H17KsbZ3IvQ_2 0 I'M JUST REMOVING THEM WITH MY TONGS
H17KsbZ3IvQ_3 0 JUST DRIPPING OUT THE OIL PUTTING THEM ON A PAPER TOWEL TO GET ALL THE EXCESS GREASE
H17KsbZ3IvQ_4 0 THEN I WOULD DO ANOTHER BATCH
H17KsbZ3IvQ_5 0 YOU SEE THAT I HAVE ANOTHER BATCH GOING I'M JUST PUTTING THEM ON MY PAPER TOWEL LETTING THEM COOL AND LETTING THAT OIL DRAIN
H17KsbZ3IvQ_6 0 KEEP DOING ALL OF YOUR FRITTERS
H17KsbZ3IvQ_7 0 WE ARE BACK
H17KsbZ3IvQ_8 0 GRACIE ALWAYS KNOWS WHEN THERE IS FOOD AROUND SHE IS BARKING UP A STORM
H17KsbZ3IvQ_9 0 BUT WE ARE BACK WE ARE LETTING OUR FRITTERS COOL AND WE ARE JUST GOING TO MAKE OUR HERVE CHEESE DIP
H17KsbZ3IvQ_10 0 I'M JUST GOING TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF SALT ON OUR FRITTERS
H17KsbZ3IvQ_11 0 I'M GOING TO GRAB SOME FRESH GROUND PEPPER
H17KsbZ3IvQ_12 0 GO A COUPLE OF TIMES AROUND THERE AND THAT IS ABOUT IT WE ARE GOING TO LET THEM SIT
H17KsbZ3IvQ_13 0 YOU HAVE TO REALIZE SOMETIMES THE BATTER IS VERY BLAND SO YOU WANT TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF SALT AND PEPPER AND JUST LET THEM SIT AND COOL
H17KsbZ3IvQ_14 0 LET'S MAKE OUR HERVE CHEESE DIP NOW
grspb1X5oRI_1 0 HI THIS IS GINNY WITH SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL CRAFTS ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
grspb1X5oRI_2 0 ONE OF THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN DECORATE YOUR RAIN STICK IS TO USE CRAFT PAPER
grspb1X5oRI_3 0 IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE LINES THAT ARE LEFT BEHIND FROM THE PAPER TOWEL OR FROM WHATEVER TUBE YOU'RE USING BUT YOU WANT TO KEEP IT TO THE NATURAL COLOR CRAFT PAPER IS A GREAT CHOICE
grspb1X5oRI_4 0 YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF OPTIONS
grspb1X5oRI_5 0 YOU COULD COVER YOUR TUBE WITH CRAFT A PAPER FIRST AND THEN PAINT AND DECORATE ON THE CRAFT PAPER
grspb1X5oRI_6 0 OR YOU CAN DECORATE THE CRAFT PAPER BEFORE YOU PUT IT ON THE TUBE
grspb1X5oRI_7 0 THAT'S WHAT I WOULD RATHER DO
grspb1X5oRI_8 0 SO YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR CRAFT PAPER
grspb1X5oRI_9 0 PUT YOUR TUBE IN IT
grspb1X5oRI_10 0 ROLL IT OUT SO THAT IT COMES TO THE EDGE AND THEN GIVE YOURSELF JUST A LITTLE BIT BEYOND THE EDGE SO THAT YOU HAVE AN OVERLAP
grspb1X5oRI_12 0 AND THEN SO THAT YOUR EDGES WILL BE NICE AND STRAIGHT ROLL IT OUT A LITTLE MORE
grspb1X5oRI_13 0 FOLD IT AT THE MARK
grspb1X5oRI_14 0 KEEPING YOUR EDGE STRAIGHT MAKE A NICE CREASE
grspb1X5oRI_15 0 RECAP YOUR PEN SO IT DOESN'T RUN OUT OF INK OR DRY UP
grspb1X5oRI_16 0 AND CUT YOUR CRAFT PAPER
grspb1X5oRI_17 0 ONCE YOUR PAPER IS CUT THAT WAY THEN YOU WANT TO CUT IT THE LENGTH THAT YOU WANT FOR YOUR TUBE
grspb1X5oRI_18 0 IF YOU HAVE BOTH ENDS OF YOUR TUBE SECURED YOU WANT YOUR CRAFT PAPER PROBABLY TO GO ALL THE WAY TO BOTH ENDS
grspb1X5oRI_19 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE SAME THING
grspb1X5oRI_20 0 YOU'RE GOING TO MARK SLIGHTLY ON THE INSIDE TO SLIGHTLY ON INSIDE OF YOUR TUBE SO THAT IT DOESN'T OVERLAP
grspb1X5oRI_21 0 FOLD IT AND CUT IT
grspb1X5oRI_22 0 AND NOW YOU'RE READY TO DECORATE
grspb1X5oRI_23 0 AS I SAID THERE ARE ONE OF TWO WAYS YOU CAN DO THIS
grspb1X5oRI_24 0 YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND GLUE IT ONTO YOUR TUBE BEFORE YOU DECORATE IT AND DECORATE IT ONCE YOU'RE ON YOUR TUBE
grspb1X5oRI_25 0 OR YOU CAN LAY IT FLAT AND TAKE YOUR PAINTS AND MAKE YOUR DESIGNS ON YOUR CRAFT PAPER BEFORE YOU PUT IT ON YOUR TUBE
grspb1X5oRI_26 0 FOR ME THAT SEEMS TO BE A SIMPLER WAY TO DO IT BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT TO WORK ON YOUR TUBE
grspb1X5oRI_27 0 THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO
grspb1X5oRI_28 0 YOU CAN USE CRAYONS
grspb1X5oRI_29 0 YOU CAN USE PAINTS
grspb1X5oRI_30 0 YOU CAN USE MARKERS
grspb1X5oRI_31 0 AND YOU COULD SIMPLY JUST MAKE LINES OR DESIGNS
grspb1X5oRI_32 0 WHATEVER YOU WOULD LIKE
grspb1X5oRI_33 0 YOU MIGHT EVEN TAKE A SPONGE AND PUT IT IN YOUR PAINT AND MAKE SPONGE DESIGNS
grspb1X5oRI_34 0 WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED YOU WANT TO COVER YOUR TUBE WITH CRAFT GLUE
grspb1X5oRI_35 0 WRAP YOUR CRAFT PAPER AROUND IT
grspb1X5oRI_36 0 USE A COUPLE OF THOSE RUBBER BANDS TO SECURE IT
grspb1X5oRI_37 0 AND WAIT UNTIL IT'S DRY
grspb1X5oRI_38 0 IF YOU'VE PAINTED IT AND YOUR RUBBER BANDS WOULD INTERFERE JUST PUT ON SOME PAPER CLIPS
gMLscPBaw2M_1 0 ABDOMINAL CRUNCH ON THE BALL
gMLscPBaw2M_2 0 NOW WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH CRUNCHES BUT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A TECHNIQUE THAT IS GOING TO KEEP YOUR NECK FROM INJURY FROM HURTING AND IT IS ALSO GOING TO HELP STRENGTHEN YOUR NECK AS YOU ARE DOING THE AB EXERCISES
gMLscPBaw2M_3 0 BECAUSE WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS THAT THEY HAVE PROBABLY AN IMBALANCE BECAUSE THEIR NECKS ARE WEAKER THAN THEIR ABS ARE AND BECAUSE THAT IS WHY THE NECK HURTS WHEN THEY ARE DOING THE ABDOMINAL CRUNCHES
gMLscPBaw2M_4 0 SO WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO IS WHEN YOU ARE HAVING A BALL YOUR SIZE MAKING SURE THAT THE THIGHS ARE PARALLEL TO THE FLOOR YOU'RE GOING TO ROLL INTO IT UNTIL THE HEAD IS PARALLEL TO THE FLOOR SO YOU HAVE THAT SUPPORT IT IS LIKE A PILLOW UNDER YOU
gMLscPBaw2M_5 0 KEEP YOUR FEET HIP WIDTH APART AND YOUR HEELS ARE UNDERNEATH YOUR KNEES SO YOU ARE NOT OUT HERE AND YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP YOUR HIPS UP
gMLscPBaw2M_6 0 YOU LOOK LIKE A TABLE TOP
gMLscPBaw2M_7 0 NOW THE PROPER WAY TO DO AN ABDOMINAL CRUNCH IS NOT LIFTING THE HEAD BUT ROLLING THE HEAD
gMLscPBaw2M_8 0 SO AS I EXHALE I AM GOING TO BRING THE CHIN INTO THE CHEST AND THEN LIFT
gMLscPBaw2M_9 0 I AM GOING TO KEEP THE TONGUE IN THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH TO ACTIVATE THE FLEXORS AND THE EXTENSORS OF THE NECK
gMLscPBaw2M_10 0 SO I'M GOING TO BE QUIET SO I CAN KEEP THE TONGUE IN THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH
gMLscPBaw2M_11 0 SO IF YOU NOTICE I AM INHALING DOWN AND YOU CAN HEAR MY EXHALATION AS I COME UP
gMLscPBaw2M_12 0 I AM GOING TO KEEP EYE CONTACT WITH THE BELLY BUTTON
gMLscPBaw2M_13 0 I LOWER MY SHOULDERS FIRST AND THEN I UNROLL MY HEAD
gMLscPBaw2M_14 0 THIS YOU ARE GOING TO DO UNTIL YOUR NECK STARTS TO FATIGUE NOT WHEN THEY FATIGUE BUT JUST BEFORE IT FATIGUES AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO CATCH UP THE STRENGTH OF THE NECK WITH THE ABDOMINAL STRENGTH
gMLscPBaw2M_15 0 SO DO ENOUGH FOR THE NECK UNTIL THE NECK FATIGUES AND THEN BEFORE YOU KNOW IT YOU ARE GOING TO BE CATCHING UP WITH THE ABS AND I'LL SHOW YOU AN ADVANCED VERSION IN ANOTHER CLIP SO I'LL SEE YOU SOON
hDUZuuFBH44_1 0 MY NAME IS SCOTT
hDUZuuFBH44_2 0 AND I'M THE OWNER OF CLIMB ON INDOOR ROCK CLIMBING GYM IN WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA
hDUZuuFBH44_3 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS HOW TO USE ROCK CLIMBING GEAR

hDUZuuFBH44_5 0 WHETHER IT BE IN YOUR INDOOR GYM OR OUTSIDE
hDUZuuFBH44_6 0 ONE VERY IMPORTANT FACT OF THAT IS THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET PROPER INSTRUCTION ON THE USE OF ANY OF THIS GEAR BEFORE YOU EVER GO OUT AND USE IT
hDUZuuFBH44_7 0 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE USE IS A ROPE FOR CLIMBING
hDUZuuFBH44_9 0 DIFFERENT PIECES OF GEAR LIKE WEDGES OR KNOTS

hDUZuuFBH44_12 0 HEXES FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF SAFETY
hDUZuuFBH44_13 0 AGAIN YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET PROPER INSTRUCTION ON THE USE OF ALL OF THIS GEAR
hDUZuuFBH44_14 0 CAMS AND CAMMING UNITS
hDUZuuFBH44_15 0 AGAIN THIS HAS BEEN HOW TO USE ROCK CLIMBING GEAR
hDUZuuFBH44_16 0 AND YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET PROPER INSTRUCTION FROM YOUR LOCAL INDOOR CLIMBING GYM
hJ3MV9e29DA_1 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF LAMINATE FIRST
hJ3MV9e29DA_2 0 THE FIRST ONE I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS THE FROSTED LUSTER
hJ3MV9e29DA_3 0 I'M HOPING THAT THEY CAN CATCH THIS ON CAMERA
hJ3MV9e29DA_4 0 IT HAS A VERY CRYSTALY SHIN TO IT IT'S A VERY UNIQUE LOOK FOR PHOTOGRAPHS FOR PEOPLE PICTURES OR JUST SIMPLE PICTURES SUCH AS THIS
hJ3MV9e29DA_5 0 SOMETHING YOU REALLY WANT TO PULL DETAIL ON
hJ3MV9e29DA_6 0 IT'S A UV PROTECTION SO YOU CAN HANG IT IN THE SUN AND IT'S GOING TO STAY THIS COLOR PINK AND THIS COLOR PINK SO MANY YEARS TO COME
hJ3MV9e29DA_7 0 WITH OTHER PRODUCTS YOU WON'T HAVE THAT SUCCESS
GEnXMNkJVOU_1 0 HI I'M AMELIA
GEnXMNkJVOU_2 0 I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO MAKE YOUR HAIR LOOK FULLER
GEnXMNkJVOU_3 0 WHEN TRYING TO MAKE YOUR HAIR LOOK FULLER WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS VOLUME THROUGH THE TOP
GEnXMNkJVOU_4 0 YOU DON'T EVEN REALLY NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT BOTTOM LAYER
GEnXMNkJVOU_5 0 ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO ADD QUICK VOLUME IS JUST TO THROW SOME CURLS IN THERE
GEnXMNkJVOU_6 0 YOU CAN DO THIS WITH A CURLING IRON FLAT IRON HOT ROLLERS IT DOESN'T MATTER
GEnXMNkJVOU_7 0 BUT YOU JUST THROW SOME IN
GEnXMNkJVOU_8 0 AND IT CAN BE REAL RANDOM
GEnXMNkJVOU_9 0 AND THEN THESE BOTTOM LAYERS YOU CAN JUST FLIP OUT A LITTLE BIT
GEnXMNkJVOU_10 0 WHEN YOUR HAIR IS ALL ONE LENGTH IT TENDS TO LOOK MORE FLAT
GEnXMNkJVOU_11 0 SO I DO RECOMMEND GETTING SOME SORT OF LAYERING
GEnXMNkJVOU_12 0 SPRAY A LITTLE BIT OF HAIRSPRAY
GEnXMNkJVOU_13 0 A LITTLE TEASING THERE AT THE SCALP
GEnXMNkJVOU_14 0 USE YOUR FINGERS
GEnXMNkJVOU_15 0 AND AS YOU CAN SEE THIS SIDE COMPARED TO THIS SIDE THIS SIDE LOOKS A LOT FULLER
GEnXMNkJVOU_16 0 AND REALLY ALL WE DID WAS JUST ADD SOME CURLS TO THE TOP
GEnXMNkJVOU_17 0 ALSO TO KEEP IT ALL DAY YOU WANT TO ALWAYS SPRAY UNDERNEATH WITH THE HAIRSPRAY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU NEED THAT HOLD
GEnXMNkJVOU_18 0 YOU DON'T NEED IT UP TOP
GEnXMNkJVOU_19 0 WHEN YOU SPRAY ON TOP THAT HAIRSPRAY WEIGHS THAT HAIR DOWN
GEnXMNkJVOU_20 0 SPRAY IT UNDERNEATH
GEnXMNkJVOU_21 0 AND I LIKE AN AEROSOL SPRAY BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIGHTER OF A MIST
GEnXMNkJVOU_22 0 SO THAT'S HOW YOU CAN GET YOUR HAIR TO LOOK FULLER
Gdb4bt99e9s_1 0 IN THIS SECTION I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT GAME NUMBER FIVE
Gdb4bt99e9s_2 0 IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO GAME NUMBER FOUR BUT IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT NOW
Gdb4bt99e9s_3 0 INSTEAD OF THEM JUST HOLDING THEIR BREATH UNDER WATER AND THEM HOLDING ONTO THE WALL NOW YOU JUST TELL THEM SUPERMAN STYLE
Gdb4bt99e9s_4 0 SO WE ALL WHAT SUPERMAN IS I'LL SHOW YOU HERE IN A BIT
Gdb4bt99e9s_5 0 YOU JUST HAVE YOUR HANDS OUT LIKE AN AIRPLANE OR OUT IN FRONT OF YOU AND YOUR LEGS STRAIGHT OUT
Gdb4bt99e9s_6 0 YOU MAY WANT TO HELP THEM WITH SUPPORT WITH THIS ONE DEFINITELY A LITTLE BIT
Gdb4bt99e9s_7 0 OR IF THEY CAN FLOAT THAT'D BE GREAT
Gdb4bt99e9s_8 0 BUT IF YOU NEED TO JUST KIND OF HOLD THEM BY THE WAIST AND TELL THEM TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND SHOW THEM THEIR SUPERMAN GLIDE LIKE SUPERMAN FLYING OR WHAT NOT
Gdb4bt99e9s_9 0 SEE HOW LONG THEY CAN DO IT FOR
Gdb4bt99e9s_10 0 HAVE THEM DO IT A COUPLE OF TIMES
Gdb4bt99e9s_11 0 IF THERE'S OTHER KIDS AROUND HAVE THEM ALL DO IT
Gdb4bt99e9s_12 0 IF YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER TO SUPPORT THEM AROUND THE WAIST SO THAT THEY DON'T GET UNDERNEATH THE WATER FOR TOO LONG OR GET WATER IN THEIR NOSE
Gdb4bt99e9s_13 0 ALWAYS REMIND THEM TO BLOW A LITTLE BIT OF AIR OUTSIDE OF THEIR NOSE
Gdb4bt99e9s_14 0 SO THAT'S GAME NUMBER FIVE
Gdb4bt99e9s_15 0 AS THEY ARE IN THE SUPERMAN POSITION IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER OR ANYBODY GRAB THEM BY THE WAIST AND YOU CAN JUST SWIRL THEM AROUND THE WATER AND JUST TAKE THEM ALL AROUND
Gdb4bt99e9s_16 0 SO THE PERSON WHO'S BEING CARRIED PRETENDS LIKE THEIR SUPERMAN AND THEY'LL LITERALLY JUST GLIDING THROUGH THE WATER FLYING THROUGH THE WATER
Gdb4bt99e9s_17 0 THAT'S THE SUPERMAN GAME
Gu3iEBjHyKY_2 0 MY NAME IS GRADY JOHNSON AND I'M A PROFESSIONAL PAINTER
Gu3iEBjHyKY_3 0 AND TODAY I'M REPRESENTING EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
Gu3iEBjHyKY_4 0 OKAY NOW WE'RE READY TO GET STARTED PAINTING AND PREPPING
Gu3iEBjHyKY_5 0 WHEN WE'RE PREPPING THE WALLS AND WE'RE GETTING EVERYTHING DONE WE WANT TO GO AHEAD AND DROP OFF THIS AREA WELL
Gu3iEBjHyKY_6 0 SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND GET THIS AREA STARTED
Gu3iEBjHyKY_7 0 I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND LAY OUT MY DROP CLOTHS
Gu3iEBjHyKY_8 0 THIS ONE'S A RUNNER AND THE THING ABOUT RUNNERS IS THAT THEY'RE WIDE ENOUGH BUT THEY'RE KIND OF THIN
Gu3iEBjHyKY_9 0 MY DROPS ARE ALL DIFFERENT THAT WAY
Gu3iEBjHyKY_10 0 SO I TAKE THESE FOR EXTERIOR AND DOUBLE THEM UP
Gu3iEBjHyKY_11 0 REMEMBER THESE EXTERIOR DROPS ARE MUCH HEAVIER AND THICKER AND WE DON'T WANT THEM TO SOAK THROUGH
Gu3iEBjHyKY_12 0 SO JUST GO AHEAD AND GET THAT
Gu3iEBjHyKY_13 0 IT'S FOLDED IN HALF AND THROW IT ON OUT
Gu3iEBjHyKY_15 0 NOW WE WANT TO GO AHEAD AND EVEN IT OUT NOW
Gu3iEBjHyKY_16 0 PULL THIS UP NEXT TO THE WALL
Gu3iEBjHyKY_17 0 IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IT DOESN'T FLIP UP LIKE THIS
Gu3iEBjHyKY_18 0 BECAUSE THEN IT GETS ON THE BACKSIDE AND YOU'VE GOT PROBLEMS
Gu3iEBjHyKY_19 0 SO MAKE SURE THAT'S EVEN ON THE WALL
Gu3iEBjHyKY_20 0 IF IT ROLLS UP LIKE THAT YOU WANT TO FLIP IT BACK
Gu3iEBjHyKY_21 0 THAT LOOKS GOOD
Gu3iEBjHyKY_22 0 SO WE WANT TO GRAB THE OTHER ONE
Gu3iEBjHyKY_23 0 NOW THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF DROP
Gu3iEBjHyKY_24 0 IT'S A WIDER KIND OF DROP BECAUSE IT'S A NINE BY TWELVE
Gu3iEBjHyKY_25 0 SO I ALWAYS FOLD THESE UP IN HALF THE OTHER WAY
Gu3iEBjHyKY_26 0 SEE YOU CAN SEE THAT HERE THAT I JUST FOLDED THAT IN HALF THE OTHER WAY
Gu3iEBjHyKY_27 0 NOW I HAVE MY DOUBLE THICKNESS AND I CAN GET THE LENGTH I WANT
Gu3iEBjHyKY_28 0 WE'RE GOING TO DO THE SAME THING AGAIN
Gu3iEBjHyKY_29 0 JUST THROW IT OUT AND PULL IT ALL THE WAY DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE WALL
Gu3iEBjHyKY_31 0 THAT'S REALLY LOOKING GOOD
Gu3iEBjHyKY_32 0 SO NOW I KNOW THAT EVERYTHING IS COMPLETELY DROPPED OFF
Gu3iEBjHyKY_33 0 SO WHETHER I'M SPACKLING CAULKING SCRAPING NO MATTER WHAT WHATEVER FALLS FROM UP TOP INCLUDING REAL THICK PAINT DROPS IT'S NOT GOING TO BLEED THROUGH
Gu3iEBjHyKY_34 0 THIS IS HOW WE DROP OF THE AREA TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK WHEN WE'RE PAINTING THE EXTERIOR OF OUR HOUSE

g6LoVNXvSe4_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS ZEPHYR CLARKE-DOLBERG FROM MIAMI DOG TRAINING
g6LoVNXvSe4_2 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO HOUSE TRAIN YOUR DOG
g6LoVNXvSe4_3 0 PREFERABLY FOR ME THE BEST ANSWER IS THE CRATE
g6LoVNXvSe4_4 0 BECAUSE DOGS ARE NATURALLY DEN ANIMALS AS WELL AS THEY ARE PACK ANIMALS
g6LoVNXvSe4_5 0 SO HAVING A NICE CLOSED IN SPACE MAKES THEM FEEL SECURE
g6LoVNXvSe4_6 0 AND AS PUPPIES THE BEST WAY TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT IS TO CONFINE THEM TO A SMALLER SPACE
g6LoVNXvSe4_7 0 NOW THE CRATES SERVES FOR A FEW PURPOSES ONE IS THAT IT STOPS THEM FROM MOVING AROUND QUITE AS MUCH WHICH STOPS THE METABOLISM FROM MAKING THEM HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM QUITE SO FREQUENTLY
g6LoVNXvSe4_8 0 SO BY PUTTING THEM IN THE CRATE AND LIMITING THEIR MOVEMENT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THAT
g6LoVNXvSe4_9 0 ALSO IS A SECURE ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM AS WELL AS DOGS DON'T LIKE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM WHERE THEY SLEEP AND EAT
g6LoVNXvSe4_10 0 COME ON ROCKO INTO YOUR HOUSE
g6LoVNXvSe4_11 0 IN YOUR HOUSE ROCKO COME ON
g6LoVNXvSe4_12 0 AND IF THEY RESIST LET THEM KNOW WHO'S BOSS BY CONTINUING AND WINNING THAT BATTLE
g6LoVNXvSe4_13 0 THIS IS ZEPHYR CLARKE-DOLBERG AND THIS HAS BEEN HOW TO HOUSE TRAIN YOUR DOG
H1g6x7nnAw8_1 0 HI I'M MAGICIAN PAUL WEATHERBEE AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A LITTLE STUNT WITH A SPOON
H1g6x7nnAw8_2 0 A NORMAL SPOON AS ANYONE CAN SEE
H1g6x7nnAw8_3 0 WATCH IF YOU TAKE THE SPOON YOU CAN BEND IT JUST LIKE THAT AND GIVE IT A RUB AND IT'S TOTALLY UNHARMED
H1g6x7nnAw8_4 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS ONE
H1g6x7nnAw8_5 0 WHEN YOU HOLD THE SPOON HOLD IT JUST LIKE THIS BUT YOU'RE NOT REALLY BENDING THE SPOON
H1g6x7nnAw8_6 0 YOU'RE OPENING UP YOUR RIGHT HAND JUST A LITTLE BIT AND MOVING YOUR RIGHT HAND THE BACK OF THE SPOON COMES RIGHT OUT OF YOUR HAND JUST LIKE THAT
H1g6x7nnAw8_7 0 THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FROM THE SIDE SO YOU CAN SEE IT COMING OUT BUT FROM THE FRONT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE ACTUALLY BENDING THE SPOON
H1g6x7nnAw8_8 0 THIS IS A GREAT LITTLE STUNT TO DO AT RESTAURANTS OR AT FORMAL PARTIES
H1g6x7nnAw8_9 0 EVERYBODY LOVES IT AND CAN HAVE FUN WITH IT
H1g6x7nnAw8_10 0 ONE MORE TIME THE BENDING SPOON
H1g6x7nnAw8_11 0 AND THAT'S THE BENDING SPOON
H1g6x7nnAw8_12 0 UNTIL NEXT TIME KEEP THE MAGIC IN YOUR LIFE
gOKWZg_vSfE_1 0 IN THIS EXAMPLE WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS KIND OF A SLOW WAH EFFECT OVER JUST A COUPLE OF MINOR CHORDS A MINOR AND B MINOR ON THE FIFTH AND SEVENTH FRETS RESPECTIVELY
gOKWZg_vSfE_2 0 AND I'M JUST GOING TO BASICALLY PLAY A SIMPLE BEAT
gOKWZg_vSfE_3 0 AND JUST OBSERVE MY FOOT IN THE SMALLER SCREEN WHAT I'M DOING TO CAPTURE THAT TYPE OF EFFECT THAT YOU CAN IMPLEMENT IN YOUR OWN PLAYING AND ALSO MAKE YOUR OWN VARIATIONS OF
gOKWZg_vSfE_4 0 AND WITH THE DRUMS IT'LL SOUND LIKE THIS
gOKWZg_vSfE_5 0 AND WHAT I'M DOING THERE IS JUST KEEPING A STEADY STRUM AND GRADUALLY BRINGING MY FOOT UP
gOKWZg_vSfE_6 0 AND YOU'LL KNOW BY YOUR EAR IF IT'S IN TIME WITH THE BEAT AND ALSO TO YOUR OWN TASTE OF HOW YOU WANT TO MANIPULATE THE WAH EFFECT
gOKWZg_vSfE_7 0 SO WHAT I'M DOING THERE IS JUST SIMPLY THEN BRINGING IT BACK DOWN FOR THE NEXT CHORD TO START THE NEXT SWEEP
gOKWZg_vSfE_8 0 AND SO WHAT YOU'RE HAVING THERE IS JUST WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS KEEP IN TIME WITH THE DRUMS AND YOU'LL KNOW BY LISTENING TO THE DRUMS HOW TO MANIPULATE YOUR PEDAL TO KEEP IN TIME WITH THE DRUMS
G68fqREbhzY_1 0 SO NOW WE HAVE COMPLETED OUR MUGS AND AS YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE HANDLED NICELY
G68fqREbhzY_2 0 I WOULD LIKE TO REVIEW A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO PREPARE THESE TO GO INTO THE BISQUE FIRE
G68fqREbhzY_3 0 FIRST OF ALL THESE POTS ARE STILL SOMEWHAT SOFT SO THIS IS THE LAST TIME THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO ANY TOOLING OR MARK THE CLAY OR ANY KIND OF DESIGN THAT INVOLVES GOUGING THE CLAY OR SCRAPING THE CLAY YOU WANT TO DO IT NOW WHILE IT IS STILL IN THIS STAGE
G68fqREbhzY_4 0 AND I'LL JUST FLIP IT OVER AND SIMPLY WRITE MY NAME IN THE BOTTOM
G68fqREbhzY_5 0 SO YOU CAN SEE HOW THE CLAY IS STILL ABLE TO BE WORKED AND THE DATE
G68fqREbhzY_6 0 OKAY SO WHILE IT IS IN THIS STAGE ANY CLEANING OF THE CLAY THAT YOU WANT TO DO YOU CAN TAKE A SPONGE AND ROUND IT OUT TAKE OFF ANY LITTLE BITS OF SLURRY CLEAN UP YOUR HANDLES THINGS LIKE THAT
G68fqREbhzY_7 0 WHEN THE CLAY IS READY TO GO IN THE KILN IT IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE THIS
G68fqREbhzY_8 0 AND AS YOU CAN SEE IF I TRY SCRATCHING IT NOW IT IS SIMPLY DUSTING AND MAKES SORT OF A NASTY LITTLE LINE SO WHEN IT IS LIKE THIS IT IS READY TO GO INTO THE KILN AND BE BISQUE FIRED WHICH IS THE FIRST STAGE OF THE FIRING PROCESS
G68fqREbhzY_9 0 THE NEXT WILL BE GLAZING
G68fqREbhzY_10 0 YOU WANT THE MUG TO DRY OUT AT A SIMILAR RATE AS THE HANDLE
G68fqREbhzY_11 0 IF THE MUG DRIES OUT TOO QUICKLY OR THE HANDLE DRIES OUT TOO QUICKLY THEN THE HANDLE WILL POP OFF EVEN THOUGH WE SLIPPED AND SCORED AND STUCK IT DOWN
G68fqREbhzY_12 0 SO IF YOU ARE IN A VERY DRY CLIMATE YOU MIGHT WANT TO SPRAY DOWN THE MUG OR SPRAY DOWN THE INDIVIDUAL SECTIONS IF THEY ARE DRYING OUT TOO MUCH
G68fqREbhzY_13 0 IF IT IS REALLY DRY YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE SOME WET PAPER TOWELS AND COVER THESE AND COVER THEM WITH PLASTIC
G68fqREbhzY_14 0 HOWEVER WE ARE IN EUGENE AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE SO THESE ARE PRETTY MUCH READY TO GO ON TO MY DRYING SHELVES AND TURN IN TO THIS
G68fqREbhzY_15 0 OKAY WELL I HOPE YOU HAVE ENJOYED BEING WITH ME IN MY STUDIO AND LEARNING HOW TO THROW MUGS
G68fqREbhzY_16 0 JOIN US AGAIN HERE ON EXPERT VILLAGE AND LEARN HOW TO THROW A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CERAMIC WARE
gtPwb4hPYe4_1 0 HI SO IN THIS SERIES WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT YOGA FOR STRENGTHENING THE UPPER BODY
gtPwb4hPYe4_2 0 AND THERE ARE A FEW CERTAIN THINGS THAT PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT A LOT WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT TRYING TO BUILD UP STRENGTH IN THEIR UPPER BODY ESPECIALLY FOR US GIRLS
gtPwb4hPYe4_3 0 NUMBER ONE STRENGTHENING THE UPPER BODY IS NOT JUST ABOUT STRENGTHENING YOUR ARMS
gtPwb4hPYe4_4 0 ITS ABOUT THE WHOLE PACKAGE WHICH INCLUDES YOUR PECKS AND IT INCLUDES YOUR TRAPEZIUS MUSCLES IT INCLUDES YOUR LATISSIMUS DORSI WHICH ARE ACROSS YOUR SHOULDER BLADES
gtPwb4hPYe4_5 0 IT INCLUDES A LOT MORE THAN JUST USING YOUR ARMS
gtPwb4hPYe4_6 0 SO INTEGRATION IS KEY
gtPwb4hPYe4_7 0 YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO IN THESE POSES THINK ABOUT NOT JUST HOLDING YOURSELF WITH YOUR ARMS OR PUSHING WITH YOUR ARMS BUT USING YOUR CORE PULLING THAT STRENGTH UP FROM YOUR CORE AND SENDING IT OUT THROUGH YOUR MUSCLES USING YOUR BACK
gtPwb4hPYe4_8 0 USING ALL OF THAT POWER THAT YOU HAVE IN THOSE LATS WHICH ARE BIG STRONG MUSCLES
gtPwb4hPYe4_9 0 AND YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO THINK ABOUT SENDING THAT ENERGY OUT THROUGH YOUR ARMS AS WE STRENGTHEN AS WE PUSH AND AS WE RELEASE
gtPwb4hPYe4_10 0 THE OTHER THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS THAT THERE ARE PUSHING MUSCLES AND THERE ARE PULLING MUSCLES
gtPwb4hPYe4_11 0 SO IN THESE POSTURES WE'RE GOING TO WORK A LOT WITH SUPPORTING OUR OWN BODY WEIGHT
gtPwb4hPYe4_12 0 WHICH IS GOING TO MEAN THAT WE'RE WORKING ON OUR PUSHING MUSCLES
gtPwb4hPYe4_13 0 RIGHT FOR SUPPORT PUSH UP
gtPwb4hPYe4_14 0 WE'LL DO THOSE SORTS OF THINGS
gtPwb4hPYe4_15 0 IT IS GOOD TO HAVE BALANCE WHICH MEANS THAT YOU ALSO SHOULD FIND ANOTHER KIND OF PRACTICE FOR STRENGTHENING YOUR PULLING MUSCLES
gtPwb4hPYe4_16 0 SUCH AS GOING TO THE GYM HANGING ON SOMETHING GETTING A CROSS BAR GETTING ONE OF THOSE CHIN UP BARS TO PUT ACROSS YOUR DOOR
gtPwb4hPYe4_17 0 HANG ON IT AND SEE IF YOU CAN DO THOSE PULL UPS
gtPwb4hPYe4_18 0 THERE ARE THINGS LIKE THAT
gtPwb4hPYe4_19 0 JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN YOU PRACTICE YOU WANT A TOTAL PRACTICE AND NOT JUST YOUR PUSHING MUSCLES AND YOUR PULLING MUSCLES
gtPwb4hPYe4_20 0 THE OTHER IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THE UPPER BODY ENCOMPASSES THE FOURTH CHAKRA WHICH IS THE HEART CHAKRA
gtPwb4hPYe4_21 0 AND IN YOGA THIS IS QUITE A BEAUTIFUL THING
gtPwb4hPYe4_22 0 THE FOURTH CHAKRA IS THE CHAKRA THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR HEART AND GIVING AND RECEIVING
gtPwb4hPYe4_23 0 IN YOGA THEY SAY THAT IF YOUR UPPER BODY IS STRONG YOU CAN GIVE AND YOU CAN RECEIVE HUGE BLESSINGS
gtPwb4hPYe4_24 0 SO KEEP THAT IN MIND AND WHEN YOU'RE STRENGTHENING YOUR WHOLE UPPER BODY AND MAKE THIS A JOYFUL PRACTICE AND NOT JUST AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT ONE ESPECIALLY AGAIN FOR THE GIRLS
gtPwb4hPYe4_25 0 ALRIGHT HERE WE GO.
GGpxbEu84iM_2 0 FOR EXPERT VILLAGE I'M EJ JOHN ERICKSON AND WE'RE CONTINUING OUR TALK ABOUT THE BARITONE SAXOPHONE
GGpxbEu84iM_3 0 SO TO THIS POINT YOU'VE STUDIED UP YOU'RE PLAYING YOUR EMBOUCHURES GREAT
GGpxbEu84iM_4 0 YOU'VE GOTTEN ALL YOUR SCALES DOWN AND YOU RE READY TO START GIGGING
GGpxbEu84iM_5 0 SO ONE OF THE THINGS NOW IS THAT WE HAVE TO GET IT OFF THE STAND IN THIS CASE THIS IS A PRETTY TYPICAL SAXOPHONE NECK STRAP
GGpxbEu84iM_6 0 IT'S GREAT FOR A TENOR ALTO OTHERS BUT IT'S REALLY NOT GOOD FOR BARI IF YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF NECK OR BACK PROBLEMS
GGpxbEu84iM_7 0 SO YOU CAN USE THESE BUT WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR WONDERFUL BARI WAS THIS WONDERFUL JUMBLY MESS OF HARNESS NECK STRAP
GGpxbEu84iM_8 0 AND SO LET'S KIND OF UNPEEL IT HERE AND GET OURSELVES TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE GOT
GGpxbEu84iM_9 0 SO JUST LIKE A REGULAR NECK STRAP YOU'VE GOT A NICE HOOK THAT COMES DOWN THE FRONT THESE WILL COME OVER THE SHOULDER AND THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'LL COME AROUND THE BACK
GGpxbEu84iM_10 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO PUT THIS ON JUST LIKE A REGULAR NECK STRAP
GGpxbEu84iM_11 0 SO TECHNICALLY WE COULD KIND OF USE IT LIKE A REGULAR NECK STRAP EXCEPT WE REACH AROUND BACK AND THERE'S TWO LITTLE HOOKS ON THE SIDE
GGpxbEu84iM_12 0 ONE HERE AND ONE HERE AND THESE LOOK REALLY GREAT WHEN YOU'RE NOT WEARING A SHIRT AT ALL
GGpxbEu84iM_14 0 SO NOW IT COMES OFF THE STAND
GGpxbEu84iM_15 0 WE'LL FIND OUR LITTLE NECK STRAP HOOK HERE AND WE'LL STRAP IT IN AND WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT WE'RE READY TO GO FOR OUR SHOULDER STRAP
GGpxbEu84iM_16 0 SO THIS CAN BE ADJUSTED JUST LIKE OUR NORMAL ONE
GGpxbEu84iM_17 0 PULL THIS LITTLE HINGE UP TO MAKE IT SO THAT IT'S MORE COMFORTABLE
GGpxbEu84iM_18 0 REALLY YOU'LL WANT IT TO REST RIGHT IN YOUR MOUTH WHICH IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE DOING
GGpxbEu84iM_19 0 SO NOW YOU'RE READY FOR YOUR FIRST GIG
GGpxbEu84iM_20 0 BUT LET'S GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF NOTES A COUPLE OF TECHNIQUES THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY ON THE BARI SAX
GGpxbEu84iM_21 0 ONE OF THE THINGS I'M GOING TO MENTION TO YOU WHICH WE DIDN'T REALLY TOUCH ON IS AFTER YOU PRACTICE AND THEN YOU'VE PRACTICED SOME MORE AND YOU PRACTICE THE FOURTH ELEMENT OF LEARNING HOW TO PLAY THE BARI IS LISTEN
GGpxbEu84iM_22 0 AND GET OUT THERE AND LISTEN TO AS MANY SAXOPHONE LISTEN TO TOWER OF POWER LISTEN TO BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS LISTEN TO JERRY MULLIGAN YOU'VE JUST TO GO OUT AND FIND THESE PLAYERS AND LISTEN TO THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE
GGpxbEu84iM_23 0 THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO COPY AND DO WHAT THEY DO
GGpxbEu84iM_24 0 SO HERE'S A COUPLE OF LITTLE TECHNIQUES THAT I'VE HEARD OVER THE YEARS THAT YOU'LL BE DOING AS WELL
GGpxbEu84iM_25 0 ONE IS JUST THE SLUR STOP AND ACTUALLY HEARD IT EXPLAINED
GGpxbEu84iM_26 0 BUT I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PLAY IT AND THEN I'LL TELL YOU HOW IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME FROM DOC KUPKA FROM TOWER OF POWER
GGpxbEu84iM_27 0 SO HE PLAYS A LITTLE LIKE THIS SOMETIMES NOT I CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING LIKE HIM BUT I'LL TRY
GGpxbEu84iM_28 0 SO LET'S TRY IT
GGpxbEu84iM_29 0 SO THAT WAS USING OUR APPENDED TIME SCALE BUT THE SLUR TO OR TIGHT STOP AND YOU ALMOST DON'T EVEN HEAR THE SECOND NOTE
GGpxbEu84iM_30 0 WHEN I WAS TALKING TO A FRIEND ABOUT IT THEY WERE SAYING THAT HIS TECHNIQUE IS TO USE A VERY LIGHT REED AND YOU THINK HE'S BARKING LIKE BLOWING INCREDIBLY LOUD THE WAY HE GETS THAT HUGE SOUND
GGpxbEu84iM_31 0 IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE THE OPPOSITE
GGpxbEu84iM_32 0 HE'S PLAYING REALLY REALLY LIGHT ON A VERY THIN REED PLAYING REALLY TIGHT AND THEY JUST MIKE HIM REALLY LOUD AND THAT'S HOW HE GETS THAT BIG POWER PUNCH SO TIGHT
GGpxbEu84iM_33 0 SO SECRET IT'S COUNTERINTUITIVE WHAT YOU THINK YOU'D PLAY BUT THAT'S IT
GGpxbEu84iM_34 0 SO DAH HOP AND STOP
GGpxbEu84iM_35 0 YOU ALMOST DON'T EVEN PLAY THAT SECOND NOTE
GGpxbEu84iM_36 0 ANYWAY DAH DOP SO GET OUT THERE BARK AWAY HAVE SOME FUN
HeuVtGhSJeU_1 0 FOR THE FIRST SPEED OF THE MIXER IS STIR OR NUMBER ONE
HeuVtGhSJeU_2 0 THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS THE SPEED IN WHICH YOU WANT TO INCORPORATE MOST OF YOUR INGREDIENTS EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT PLANNING ON STAYING ON SUCH A LOW SPEED
HeuVtGhSJeU_3 0 YOUR PRIMARY BEATERS THAT YOU'LL BE USING FOR THE STIR SPEED WOULD BE YOUR DOUGH HOOK PARTICULARLY WHEN MAKING BREAD AND ALSO YOUR PADDLE
HeuVtGhSJeU_4 0 YOUR FLAT PADDLE IS GOING TO BE GREAT FOR MIXING ALL SORTS OF THINGS EVEN IF YOU HAVE IT ON STIR THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT YOU CAN USE YOUR FLAT BEATER OR THE FLAT PADDLE FOR
HeuVtGhSJeU_5 0 THE BIG ONE WOULD BE MASH POTATOES YOU'RE MAKING MASH POTATOES INSTEAD OF MASHING THEM UP
HeuVtGhSJeU_6 0 IF YOU WANT TO INCORPORATE ALL THE INGREDIENTS NICE AND THOROUGHLY AND ALSO GET THOSE POTATOES NICE AND FLUFFY YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO USE THE FLAT PADDLE AND A SLOW SPEED
HeuVtGhSJeU_7 0 AT THIS SPEED THE POTATOES WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DEVELOP ANY GLUTTON AND SO YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE NICE LIGHT FLUFFY POTATOES
HeuVtGhSJeU_8 0 YOU'LL ALSO USE THE STIR SPEED ANYTIME YOU ARE INCORPORATING INGREDIENTS INTO A DOUGH OR BATTER THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE YOU DON'T WANT TO START OFF REALLY FAST AND HAVE THE INGREDIENTS FLY BACK OUT OF THE BOWL
HeuVtGhSJeU_9 0 STIR IS A GREAT WAY TO SLOWLY INCORPORATE YOUR INGREDIENTS INTO YOUR BATTER
gM5vQc3fywI_1 0 THE WATER GOES RIGHT STRAIGHT ON DOWN THROUGH AND THAT IS ESSENTIAL WHEN YOU'VE GOT LIKE A SET OF DRY SEEDS
gM5vQc3fywI_2 0 THAT SEED IS DRIED OUT SO THAT IT DOESN'T TRY TO GERMINATE IN THE PACKAGE
gM5vQc3fywI_3 0 ANY MOISTURE IN THE PACKAGE WILL CAUSE IT TO GERMINATE PREMATURELY OR EVEN SPOIL
gM5vQc3fywI_4 0 SO THEY ARE DRY JUST LIKE DRY AS A POWDER HOUSE YOU MIGHT SAY BECAUSE THE MOISTURE IS A BAD THING FOR A SEED UNTIL YOU GET READY TO GERMINATE IT
gM5vQc3fywI_5 0 ONCE YOU GET IT IN CONTACT WITH THE SOIL AND IF YOU HAVE GOOD SOIL TO SEED CONTACT AND YOU PUT MOISTURE ON IT THE SEED SHOULD GERMINATE UNDER THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE CONDITION SHOULD GERMINATE AND FORM A NEW PLANT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE IT A LITTLE BIT UNDER THE GROUND
gM5vQc3fywI_6 0 ORDINARILY WHEN YOU PLANT SEEDS THE RULE OF THUMB IS TO PLANT THE SEED THREE TIMES THE THICKNESS OF THE SEED
gM5vQc3fywI_7 0 SO IF YOU HAD A SEED THAT WAS AS BIG AS MY THUMB YOU WOULD WANT TO PLANT IT ABOUT THAT DEEP
gM5vQc3fywI_8 0 YOU'LL PUT THAT MUCH DIRT ON IT FROM MY FINGER OVER YOU WOULD WANT TO PUT A LOT OF DIRT OVER IT
gM5vQc3fywI_9 0 THESE TOMATO SEEDS BEING AS TINY AS THEY WERE YOU JUST BARELY PUT THEM UNDER THE SOIL
gmWD2rw_Qvw_1 0 HELLO THIS IS RICK KENNEDY FOR EXPERT VILLAGE

gmWD2rw_Qvw_9 0 AND THAT'S ALSO PART OF THE FLASH
gmWD2rw_Qvw_10 0 SO NOW WE SELECT OUR FILE AND AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE THE SERVICE SIDE AND THE KK COUTURE FORWARDER
GV3LWLakDLk_1 0 A GREAT WAY TO LEARN HOW TO DO FRONTSIDE NOSEBLUNT SLIDES IS FIRST TO PREPARE YOURSELF FOR THE POPPING OUT PART
GV3LWLakDLk_2 0 SINCE THIS TRICK CONSISTS OF TWO SEPARATE PARTS BASICALLY GETTING IN AND SLIDING AND THEN POPPING OUT AND ROLLING AWAY
GV3LWLakDLk_3 0 YOU CAN SET YOURSELF UP IN THE POSITION AND PRACTICE POPPING OUT AND ROLLING AWAY
GV3LWLakDLk_4 0 THIS IS THE HARDEST PART OF THE NOSEBLUNT SLIDE
GV3LWLakDLk_5 0 SO IF YOU LEARN SEPARATELY HOW TO PUT THIS TOGETHER WHEN YOU DO GET INTO GOOD FRONTSIDE NOSEBLUNT SLIDE YOU'LL BE BETTER PREPARED WHEN IT COMES TIME TO POP OUT AND ROLL AWAY
GV3LWLakDLk_6 0 SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS JUST SET UP ON WHATEVER LEDGE YOU WANT TO END UP POPPING OUT ON BY PUTTING YOUR FOOT ON THE TIP OF THE NOSE AND YOUR BACK FOOT SOMEWHERE BEHIND THE TRUCKS
GV3LWLakDLk_7 0 NOW IMAGINE THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABOUT WHEN YOUR SPEED RUNS OUT AND YOU'VE REACHED THE END OF YOUR NOSEBLUNT SLIDE
GV3LWLakDLk_8 0 SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS JUST PRACTICE POPPING OUT JUST REPEAT THE MOTION AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO TEST IT OUT
GV3LWLakDLk_9 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO PUT YOUR FOOT ON THE TIP OF THE NOSE AND POP IT OUT SO IT CLEARS IT
GV3LWLakDLk_10 0 NOW THE MORE YOU TRY THIS THE MORE BETTER PREPARED YOU'LL BE WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF YOUR NOSEBLUNT SLIDE
GV3LWLakDLk_11 0 SO REMEMBER YOU CAN TEST IT ANYWAY THAT YOU WANT
GV3LWLakDLk_12 0 JUST GET UP THERE PUT YOUR BOARD THERE AND KEEP PRACTICING POPPING OUT
GV3LWLakDLk_13 0 AND THIS WILL HELP YOU LEARN HOW TO GET OUT OF A FRONTSIDE NOSEBLUNT SLIDE
GQXKm3M9-Cs_1 0 HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS BECOMING THE BEST DEFENSIVE PLAYER YOU CAN INCLUDES BECOMING A GOOD FUNDAMENTAL DEFENSIVE PLAYER AND A GOOD DEFENSIVE TEAMMATE AS WELL
GQXKm3M9-Cs_2 0 AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE RIGHT NOW IS A SITUATION WHERE THIS GUY IS GUARDING THE MAN ON THE WING
GQXKm3M9-Cs_3 0 THIS GUY RIGHT NOW HAS THE BALL SO HE HAS TO COMMIT TO HIM AND HE HAS TO GUARD HIM FULLY BUT AS QUICKLY AS THE BALL MOVES FROM THERE GO AHEAD AND MOVE IT TO THE TOP OF THE KEY
GQXKm3M9-Cs_4 0 NOW HIS JOB HAS TO BE IN HELP SIDE
GQXKm3M9-Cs_5 0 HE CAN'T BE SLOW AND COMING OFF THIS GUY AND JUST EASILY COME IN HERE AND HELP
GQXKm3M9-Cs_6 0 BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THIS GUY IS GOING TO CATCH THE BALL AND HE'S GOING TO DRIVE PAST HIS MAN
GQXKm3M9-Cs_7 0 HE'S GOT TO BE HERE AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING OVER AND HELPING TO STOP THAT MIDDLE OF THE DRIVE
GQXKm3M9-Cs_8 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE OUT HERE GUARDING YOUR MAN AND YOU GO ON HELP SIDE AGAIN YOU NEED TO STAY LOW DROP STEP AND KEEP THOSE GOOD WIDE STANCES UP OR SPRINT TO A PARTICULAR POINT TO TRY TO GET OVER AND STOP THIS GUY
GQXKm3M9-Cs_9 0 NOW AS HE'S COMING IN ON THE DRIVE WHAT THIS GUY NEEDS TO DO SO MANY TIMES WE SEE OUR DEFENDERS COME IN AND THEY'LL GET HERE AND AS THIS GUY'S DRIVING BY THEY WANT TO OPEN UP AND TRY TO SWAT HIM FROM BEHIND
GQXKm3M9-Cs_10 0 DON'T DO THAT
GQXKm3M9-Cs_11 0 IF HE TAKES ONE MORE ADDITIONAL STEP AND GETS OVER IN FRONT OF THIS GUY EITHER ONE HE'S GOING TO STOP HIM AND MAKE HIM PULL UP AND SHOOT A JUMP SHOT OR IF HE KEEPS GOING HE'S GOING TO GET HIT AND TAKE A CHARGE ON THE CALL
GQXKm3M9-Cs_12 0 EITHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS ARE GOOD FOR OUR TEAM
GQXKm3M9-Cs_13 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU AT FULL SPEED HERE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE WHEN HE COMES OVER ON HELP SIDE TO STOP THE DRIVE
GQXKm3M9-Cs_15 0 GOOD HELP HIM OVER
GQXKm3M9-Cs_17 0 SO YOU CAN SEE THAT HE CAUSED HIM TO PULL UP AND SHOOT A JUMP SHOT MAYBE EVEN GET A CHARGE BECAUSE HE WAS THERE HE WAS SET ON THE POSITION HANDS STRAIGHT UP AND THIS GUY WENT INTO HIM
GQXKm3M9-Cs_18 0 SO YOU'RE EITHER GOING TO GET A CHARGE CALL OR YOU'RE GOING TO GET HIM TO PULL UP
GQXKm3M9-Cs_19 0 AND THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO GET OVER AND STOP THE MIDDLE DRIVE
HCKYA56xZo4_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR GLOVES AND YOUR HATS
HCKYA56xZo4_2 0 THESE LITTLE THINGS WILL MAKE A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE AND A VERY CRITICAL DIFFERENCE STAYING COMFORTABLE IN SUB ZERO WEATHERS
HCKYA56xZo4_3 0 JUST LIKE WITH THE SILK CLOTHING YOU START WITH A SILK LINER AND WORK YOUR WAY UP
HCKYA56xZo4_4 0 AND YOU DO THIS BOTH WITH YOUR HEAD COVERING AND ON YOUR GLOVES
HCKYA56xZo4_5 0 YOU START WITH A SILK LINER AND THEN GO OVER WITH POLYPROPYLENE LINER
HCKYA56xZo4_6 0 AND THEN ON TOP OF THE PROPYLENE LINER I PREFER TO WEAR A GLOMMIT WHICH IS A GLOVE-MITTEN COMBINATION
HCKYA56xZo4_7 0 THIS IS A WOOL GLOMMIT AND BY WORKING IT THIS WAY I NOW HAVE MY FINGERS FREE TO ADJUST THINGS
HCKYA56xZo4_8 0 TO PULL THE TRIGGER TO SHOOT TO GET THINGS OUT OF MY GEAR WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE MY GLOVES OFF AND GET MY WHOLE HAND CHILLED IN THAT MANNER
HCKYA56xZo4_9 0 AND THEN ALSO FOR FOUL WEATHER PURPOSES YOU CAN GET A LEATHER SHELL TO PUT OVER TOP OF THE MITTEN THAT WILL ALSO STILL HAVE A LITTLE CREASE IN IT WHERE YOU CAN GET YOUR FINGER OUT TO WORK THE TRIGGER
HCKYA56xZo4_10 0 OKAY THE OTHER CONSIDERATION AND THIS IS WHERE MOST OF YOUR HEAT LOSS WILL COME FROM IS AROUND YOUR NECK AND FROM YOUR HEAD
HCKYA56xZo4_11 0 SO YOUR HEAD COVERING AND AROUND YOUR NECK BECOME VERY VERY CRITICAL TO MAINTAIN YOUR BODY HEAT IN SUB ZERO TEMPERATURES
HCKYA56xZo4_12 0 A NICE SILK SCARF WRAPPED AROUND YOUR NECK WILL INCREASE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WHILE YOU'RE ON STAND BY A GOOD FIFTEEN TO TWENTY DEGREES
HCKYA56xZo4_13 0 THIS KEEPS THE HEAT FROM TOO MUCH HEAT FORM ESCAPING AROUND YOUR NECK AND YOUR OPEN COLLAR AREA AND THIS ALSO WORKS AS A REGULATOR SO YOU CAN REGULATE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE
HCKYA56xZo4_14 0 WHEN YOU START GETTING TOO WARM YOU CAN OPEN THE SCARF OR TAKE IT OFF AND THEN PUT THE SCARF BACK ON
HCKYA56xZo4_15 0 OKAY THE SAME THING WITH USING A SILK FACE MASK FIRST AND THEN FOLLOWED BY WOOL AND ON TOP OF THE WOOL YOU CAN PUT A WEATHER COVER
HCKYA56xZo4_16 0 THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE THAT WEAR GLASSES REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM
HCKYA56xZo4_17 0 BECAUSE NOW ALL MY MOISTURE ALL THAT'S COMING EVAPORATING OUT OF MY BODY ESCAPES AROUND MY GLASSES
HCKYA56xZo4_18 0 SO KEEPING GLASSES THAWED OUT IN THESE TEMPERATURES IS HARD TO DO
HCKYA56xZo4_19 0 SO TRY TO WEAR PLASTIC LENSES OR GO TO TWO PAIR OF GLASSES AND YOU TAKE ONE PAIR OFF
HCKYA56xZo4_20 0 YOU STICK THEM IN YOUR POCKETS SO THEY WARM UP AND THEN YOU'RE CONSTANTLY SWITCHING GLASSES
HCKYA56xZo4_21 0 SO IF YOU'RE HANDICAP LIKE I AM WHERE YOU HAVE TO WEAR GLASSES ALL THE TIME THIS BECOMES A LITTLE BIT OF A HASSLE
h7nobJX6cyc_1 0 TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FORKS SPOONS AND KNIVES THE SERVING UTENSILS AND WHAT YOU CAN USE AT YOUR PARTY TO LIVEN IT UP AND ADD COLOR
h7nobJX6cyc_2 0 WE HAVE FORKS SPOONS AND KNIVES IN EVERY COLOR ALONG WITH WHITE AND CLEAR
h7nobJX6cyc_3 0 THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN DISPLAY THEM AND I'LL SHOW YOU A WAY THAT I PERSONALLY REALLY LIKE

h7nobJX6cyc_5 0 I'VE PUT SOME CUTE LITTLE BRIDAL CONFETTI IN HERE
h7nobJX6cyc_6 0 THERE'S LITTLE RINGS ON IT AND HEARTS
h7nobJX6cyc_7 0 JUST PUT IT IN THE BOTTOM KIND OF AND SPREAD IT AROUND
h7nobJX6cyc_8 0 THEN I TOOK I'M GOING TO TAKE SOME KNIVES HOWEVER MANY YOU NEED

G6ObYwZN4tg_2 0 HOW YOU DOING

G6ObYwZN4tg_6 0 NOW I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT HOW THE FULCRUM ACTUALLY AFFECTS THE DIVING BOARD
G6ObYwZN4tg_7 0 THE BOARD IS GOING TO BEND IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHERE YOU HAVE THE FULCRUM
G6ObYwZN4tg_8 0 SO IF I MOVE THE FULCRUM ALL THE WAY UP WHAT I'M DOING IS ACTUALLY SHORTENING THE DISTANCE TO THE END OF THE BOARD
G6ObYwZN4tg_9 0 IF YOU'VE EVER TRIED TO PUSH DOWN ON SOMETHING IF YOU'VE HAD A HEAVY WEIGHT THE SHORTER DISTANCE YOU HAVE BETWEEN YOURSELF AND THAT WEIGHT THE HARDER IT IS TO PUSH DOWN
G6ObYwZN4tg_10 0 BUT IF YOU'VE GOT A FULCRUM IN THE MIDDLE AND YOUR DISTANCE IS WIDER IT'S A LOT EASIER TO PUSH OR BEND OR MOVE THAT OBJECT
G6ObYwZN4tg_11 0 SO WHEN I'VE GOT THE FULCRUM ALL THE WAY UP THE BOARD IS A LITTLE STIFFER
G6ObYwZN4tg_12 0 IT DOESN'T BEND AS MUCH
G6ObYwZN4tg_13 0 OKAY IF I MOVE THE FULCRUM ALL THE WAY BACK I'M LENGTHENING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE END OF THE BOARD AND MY FULCRUM
G6ObYwZN4tg_14 0 THAT'S GOING TO MEAN THE BOARD WILL BEND FARTHER
G6ObYwZN4tg_15 0 NOW A COUPLE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT
G6ObYwZN4tg_16 0 WHEN A BOARD BENDS FARTHER IT TAKES LONGER TO GO UP AND DOWN
G6ObYwZN4tg_17 0 IF IT'S CLOSER UP IT TAKES A SHORTER TIME
gggVQzrow34_1 0 HI MY NAME IS ATHENA REICH AND I'M A SINGER SONGWRITER AND MUSIC COACH HERE IN NEW YORK CITY

gggVQzrow34_14 0 THIS HAS BEEN ATHENA REICH FOR THE PARTS OF A KEYBOARD IN NEW YORK CITY
gPe3-yN0Cr8_1 0 WE ARE GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE BLACK AND THE GOLD ACCENTS BLACK WITH GOLD ACCENTS
gPe3-yN0Cr8_2 0 THEY COME IN A RAY OF OF SIZES AND DIFFERENT SHAPES AND STYLES
gPe3-yN0Cr8_3 0 THEY ARE GOING TO BE MORE FOR UP TYPE PICTURES
gPe3-yN0Cr8_4 0 SOMETHING IN A FANCIER SETTING SOMETHING YOU MIGHT FIND IN THE BANK OR AT THE MUSEUM EVEN
gPe3-yN0Cr8_5 0 THIS IS ONE THAT I USE TO USE IN THE MUSEUM QUIET REGULARLY IT JUST MADE THINGS LOOK MORE PREDOMINANT AND MORE UP TYPE THOUGHT
gPe3-yN0Cr8_6 0 YOU HAVE THE SIMPLER THOUGHTS YOU HAVE THE DOCUMENT TYPE THOUGHTS RIGHT HERE THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT SIZES
gPe3-yN0Cr8_7 0 I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE USE THEIR DOCUMENTS IN THESE THOUGHTS
gPe3-yN0Cr8_8 0 YOU CAN MIX AND MATCH THESE TOGETHER OR PUT THEM TOGETHER WITH SOMETHING ELSE AND MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT BIGGER A LITTLE LITTLER
gPe3-yN0Cr8_9 0 NOT SO FANCY NOT AS FANCY JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE FANCIER AND YET YOU HAVE YOUR SCULPTED AREAS OUT HERE AND YOU HAVE LITTLE ACCENT OF GOLD THERE
gPe3-yN0Cr8_10 0 JUST KIND OF HOW WE DID WITH THE FELIX
gPe3-yN0Cr8_11 0 SOME GOLD COME THAT WAY TO GIVE IT THAT LOOK YOU MIGHT FIND THIS AROUND A ORIGIN PIECE OR EGYPTIAN TYPE PIECE THAT TENDS TO GO REALLY WELL WITH THOSE THINGS
gPe3-yN0Cr8_12 0 THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE RUSTED IT HAS SOME GOLD IN IT
gPe3-yN0Cr8_13 0 IT IS GREAT FOR LIKE MAYBE THE HOUSE THE GRANDMA LIVED IN WHEN SHE WAS A KID
gPe3-yN0Cr8_14 0 THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR THAT OR THE OLD BARN THAT THEY ARE FIXING TO DESTROY AND THE PICTURE YOU CAPTURED FOR LATER DAYS DOWN THE ROAD
gPe3-yN0Cr8_15 0 IT IS A FAUX LOOK IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN AGED AND THEN THEY TOOK AND MADE THE FRAME AND PRODUCT OUT OF IT
gPe3-yN0Cr8_16 0 THEY ACTUALLY MADE IT LOOK OLD PURPOSELY
G4mh7TUKhh4_1 0 NOW THE FIRST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS PREVENTING CONVERSATIONAL PROBLEMS
G4mh7TUKhh4_2 0 WE'VE GOT LOTS OF DIFFERENT PHASES WE COULD TALK ABOUT
G4mh7TUKhh4_3 0 WE COULD TALK ABOUT ONCE WE'VE ALREADY SAID THE STUPID THING AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO FIX IT BUT BEFORE WE EVEN GET THAT FAR I WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT PREVENTING SAYING THE WRONG THING OR UPSETTING SOMEONE BEFORE YOU EVER DO IT
G4mh7TUKhh4_4 0 AND A LOT OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH IS KNOWING WHO YOU'RE SPEAKING TO AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO FEEL ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS
G4mh7TUKhh4_5 0 IF YOU EVEN ANTICIPATE THAT YOUR LISTENERS MIGHT BE OFFENDED BY WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY MIGHT TAKE IT THE WRONG WAY MIGHT FIND IT INAPPROPRIATE THEN WHAT YOU WANT TO USE AS A SPEAKER AND I'M NOT EVEN TALKING IN THE SENSE OF A SPEAKER I'M TALKING AS THE COMMUNICATOR IS A DISCLAIMER
G4mh7TUKhh4_6 0 AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISCLAIMER BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS USE A DISCLAIMER TO PREVENT CONVERSATIONAL PROBLEMS
gF00QsgoylI_1 0 ALRIGHT SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR FLASH CARD INSTALLED IN YOUR CAMERA YOU'VE GOT YOUR BATTERY AND NOW YOU NEED TO TAKE SOME PICTURES
gF00QsgoylI_2 0 BEFORE YOU DO THAT YOU NEED TO PUT YOUR LENS ON YOUR CAMERA
gF00QsgoylI_3 0 SO WITH THE 40D YOU HAVE A CAP OVER THE BODY OF THE CAMERA PROTECTING THE SENSOR AND THE SHUTTER FROM ANY LIGHT OR DUST
gF00QsgoylI_4 0 YOU SHOULD KEEP THIS CAP ON THE CAMERA ANYTIME THERE'S NOT A LENS ON THE CAMERA TO PROTECT IT FROM GETTING DUST IN THERE OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT MIGHT DAMAGE YOUR SENSOR OR LENS OR MIRROR
gF00QsgoylI_5 0 SO TO TAKE THIS THING OFF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS THERE'S A BUTTON ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CAMERA IF YOU'RE FACING THE BACK OF THE CAMERA
gF00QsgoylI_6 0 IT'S GOING TO BE ON THE LEFT SIDE
gF00QsgoylI_7 0 AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS PRESS THAT DOWN AND THEN TWIST THE CAP OFF
gF00QsgoylI_8 0 IT SHOULD JUST COME RIGHT OFF
gF00QsgoylI_9 0 AND WHAT I'VE GOT HERE IS A CANON 35MM 1.4 APERTURE FIXED FOCAL LENGTH L LENS
gF00QsgoylI_10 0 ANY CANON EFS LENS THERE IS A WHITE DOT ON THE BODY OF THE CANON WHERE THOSE LENSES WILL NEED TO LINE UP
gF00QsgoylI_11 0 BUT ANY CANON EFS ANY CANON LENS THAT IS NOT AN EFS LENS WILL HAVE A RED DOT INSTEAD
gF00QsgoylI_12 0 IN THIS CASE I HAVE AN L LENS WHICH HAS A RED DOT ON THE LENS AND THERE'S A RED DOT ON THE BODY
gF00QsgoylI_13 0 AND THOSE TWO DOTS SHOULD LINE UP WHEN YOU PUT THE LENS ON THE BODY AND THEN YOU CAN TWIST THE LENS ON
gF00QsgoylI_14 0 IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO BE TWISTING IT TWISTING THE CAMERA ON THE LENS ONTO THE CAMERA CLOCKWISE
gF00QsgoylI_15 0 SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS LINE UP THOSE TWO RED DOTS AND THEN TWIST THE LENS UNTIL IT STOPS
gF00QsgoylI_16 0 AND YOU DON'T NEED TO PRESS HARD IT SHOULD SLIDE IN THERE PRETTY EASILY
gF00QsgoylI_17 0 ONCE THE LENS STOPS IT'S LOCKED IN THERE AND YOU CAN'T TWIST IT ANY WAY
gF00QsgoylI_18 0 IT'S JUST IT'S THERE
gF00QsgoylI_19 0 IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THE LENS OFF AGAIN WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO IS PRESS THAT LENS LOCK RELEASE OVER HERE ON THE ON THIS SIDE OF THE CAMERA
gF00QsgoylI_20 0 AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS PRESS THAT DOWN AND THEN JUST TWIST THE LENS OFF COUNTER-CLOCKWISE
gF00QsgoylI_21 0 IT SHOULD COME OFF PRETTY EASILY
gF00QsgoylI_22 0 BUT LIKE I SAID YOU DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THAT EXPOSED FOR VERY LONG SO EITHER KEEP A CAP ON THE BODY OR A LENS ON THE BODY
gF00QsgoylI_23 0 A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO KEEP THEIR LENSES STORED IN A CASE TO PROTECT THEM INSTEAD OF LEAVING THEM ON THEIR CAMERA BODY BECAUSE THEY'RE EXPENSIVE
GJAGGMJR-b4_2 0 THIS IS KEVIN FOR EXPERT VILLAGE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO AVOID RAZOR BURNS AND CUTS
GJAGGMJR-b4_3 0 A BIG CHOICE IS WHAT RAZOR TO USE
GJAGGMJR-b4_4 0 STARTING WITH DO YOU WANT AN ELECTRIC RAZOR OR A WET RAZOR
GJAGGMJR-b4_5 0 IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH RAZOR BURN IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN I REALLY RECOMMEND GOING WITH THE WET RAZOR
GJAGGMJR-b4_6 0 WITH THE WET RAZOR IT'S EASY TO CONTROL THE DIRECTION ONCE THE RAZOR CONTACTS THE SKIN
GJAGGMJR-b4_7 0 ALSO WITH THE WET RAZOR YOU CAN BETTER CONTROL THE PRESSURE OF THE RAZOR HITTING THE SKIN
GJAGGMJR-b4_8 0 IF YOU WANT TO GET AN ELECTRIC RAZOR AT LEAST GET A MODERN ONE THAT YOU CAN USE SHAVING CREAM WITH
GJAGGMJR-b4_9 0 REALLY I RECOMMEND WET RAZORS FOR BETTER CONTROL
GJAGGMJR-b4_10 0 THERE ARE CHOICES
GJAGGMJR-b4_11 0 EVERYTHING FROM ONE BLADE TO FOUR BLADES ON A SINGLE HEAD
GJAGGMJR-b4_12 0 THERE ARE DISPOSABLE RAZORS AND THERE ARE RAZORS WITH REPLACEABLE CARTRIDGES
GJAGGMJR-b4_13 0 I FEEL THAT THE DISPOSABLE RAZORS ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE BEST CHOICE BECAUSE THEY CAN TAKE A VERY ROUGH ANGLE AGAINST THE FACE
GJAGGMJR-b4_14 0 IT'S TOO EASY TO SHAVE TOO DEEPLY AND IRRITATE THE SKIN
GJAGGMJR-b4_15 0 ON THE OTHER HAND THE HEADS WITH THREE OR FOUR BLADES THAT'S A LOT OF RAZOR CONTACT AGAINST THE SKIN SO THAT CAN CAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS TOO
GJAGGMJR-b4_16 0 IT'S A WELL DESIGNED RAZOR WITH MAYBE TWO BLADES AND A MOISTURIZING STRIP
GJAGGMJR-b4_17 0 IT GIVES A SMOOTH SHAVE YET IT HELPS TO PROTECT TO THE SKIN
GJAGGMJR-b4_18 0 IT MAKES IT EASIER NOT TO SHAVE TOO DEEPLY
GJAGGMJR-b4_19 0 TRY DIFFERENT RAZORS
GJAGGMJR-b4_20 0 SEE WHICH ONE GIVES YOU THE MOST GENERAL SHAVE
gvrY5rE0ZbA_1 0 HI I'M KAREN FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
gvrY5rE0ZbA_2 0 NOW LET'S WHIP SOME CREAM FOR DECORATING OUR LEMON MOUSSE
gvrY5rE0ZbA_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE USING A CUP OF WHIPPING CREAM AND JUST POUR THAT IN THERE
gvrY5rE0ZbA_4 0 NOW IF YOU'RE USING A NONDAIRY WHIPPING CREAM IT'S ALREADY SWEETENED
gvrY5rE0ZbA_5 0 IF YOU'RE USING A WHIPPING CREAM OR A HEAVY CREAM THAT ISN'T SWEETENED YOU MAY WANT TO ADD A LITTLE BIT OF CONFECTION OR SUGAR JUST TO SWEETEN IT A BIT
gvrY5rE0ZbA_6 0 WE'LL WHIP THAT UNTIL IT'S NICE AND IT HAS STIFF PEAKS
gvrY5rE0ZbA_7 0 OKAY OUR WHIPPING CREAM IS DONE
gvrY5rE0ZbA_8 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO PLACE THIS WHIPPING CREAM INTO A PASTRY BAG FITTED WITH A WIDE STAR TIP
gvrY5rE0ZbA_9 0 NOW EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED IN CAKE DECORATING IT'S WELL WORTH IT TO GET A BIG PASTRY BAG AND SOME NICE WIDE TIPS FOR DECORATING WITH WHIPPED CREAM BECAUSE IT'S SO EASY
gvrY5rE0ZbA_10 0 I'M GOING TO USE THE WIDEST TIP AND YOU JUST PUT THE TIP INTO THE PASTRY BAG AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S IN THERE NICE AND TIGHT
gvrY5rE0ZbA_11 0 FOLD DOWN THE TOP OF THE PASTRY BAG AND YOU USE YOUR HAND UNDERNEATH LIKE THIS TO HOLD THE BAG AND THEN YOU CAN JUST FILL IT
gvrY5rE0ZbA_12 0 SCOOP THE WHIPPING CREAM RIGHT INTO THERE TO FILL IT
gvrY5rE0ZbA_13 0 FILL IT UP AND PUSH THE WHIPPING CREAM DOWN INTO THE TIP TO FILL THE BAG NICELY AND WE'LL SET THAT ASIDE
gvrY5rE0ZbA_14 0 THEN JUST UNFOLD IT AND GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT OF A SCOOT TO GET THE CREAM ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO THE TIP
gvrY5rE0ZbA_15 0 NOW GATHER UP THE EXTRA BAG AND IN YOUR HAND LIKE THIS WITH YOUR THUMB AND YOUR FINGER HOLDING THE PASTRY BAG AND YOUR PALM IS GOING TO DO THE SQUEEZING YOU TWIST THE BAG SO THIS YOUR THUMB AND YOUR FINGER ARE HOLDING THE EXCESS BAG AND YOU'RE TWISTING LIKE THIS TO PUT SOME PRESSURE ON THE CONTENT
gvrY5rE0ZbA_16 0 THEN AS YOU DECORATE YOU'RE GOING TO SQUEEZE YOUR HAND BETWEEN YOUR FINGERS AND YOUR PALM AND THAT'S HOW YOU SQUEEZE IT
gvrY5rE0ZbA_17 0 YOU'RE GOING TO GUIDE WITH YOUR OTHER HAND AND YOU CAN MAKE SIMPLE ROSETTES OR YOU CAN MAKE LITTLE EIGHTS AND WE'RE GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY AROUND OUR LEMON MOUSSE WITH SOMETHING PRETTY
Gyna2-jM9kg_1 0 ALRIGHT ONCE YOU CAN CONFIDENTLY DO A THREE UP FLASH WITH A CLAP ONE TIME THROUGH AND YOU CAN DO IT STARTING FROM EITHER HAND IT'S TIME FOR THE NEXT STEP
Gyna2-jM9kg_2 0 AND THE NEXT STEP IS TO DO CONTINUOUS ONES OK AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS A THREE UP FLASH STARTING WITH SAY YOUR LEFT HAND WITH A CLAP THEY ALL COME DOWN OR THEY COME DOWN ONE AT A TIME
Gyna2-jM9kg_3 0 YOU IMMEDIATELY THROW THEM RIGHT BACK UP AND DO A THREE UP FLASH BUT STARTING WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND CLAP AND SO FORTH AND IT GOES BACK AND FORTH
Gyna2-jM9kg_4 0 AND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IS THIS LIKE THAT OK AND YOU'RE JUST GOING BACK AND FORTH AND IT I BELIEVE THAT THAT PATTERN'S A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT THAN JUGGLING FIVE BUT IF YOU CAN DO THAT IT MAKES JUGGLING FIVE ALL THE EASIER
Gyna2-jM9kg_5 0 AND IT REALLY HONES IN YOU GETTING BOTH SIDES EVEN SO THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO LEARN TO DO IS DO THE CONTINUOUS THREE UP FLASHES WITH A CLAP BACK AND FORTH
GZwewfRheIs_1 0 HI MY NAME IS RACHEL YOUENS AND I'M A FREELANCE FASHION JOURNALIST AND THE OWNER OF AUSTIN STYLE WATCH.COM STREET FASHION SITE AND WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS HOW TO GET A WINE STAIN OUT OF LIGHT COLORED MATERIAL
GZwewfRheIs_2 0 NOW IF YOU'RE MESSY LIKE ME YOU SPILL RED WINE A LOT
GZwewfRheIs_3 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF RED WINE ON THIS WHITE SHIRT
GZwewfRheIs_5 0 THAT'S A LITTLE MORE THAN I WANTED TO GET BUT HEY IT HAPPENS
GZwewfRheIs_6 0 ANYHOW SO ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO GET RED WINE OUT IS OXICLEAN AND THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE IT THE PEROXIDE IN IT BREAKS DOWN THE STAIN AND BASICALLY ONE OF THE MAIN INGREDIENTS IN OXICLEAN IS A SOLID FORM OF PEROXIDE
GZwewfRheIs_7 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS MAKE A COMBINATION OF JUST YOUR GENERAL HOUSEHOLD PEROXIDE AND DISH WASHING LIQUID
GZwewfRheIs_8 0 AND AS I UNDERSTAND DAWN IS THE BEST KIND TO USE BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE USING PALMOLIVE TODAY
GZwewfRheIs_9 0 SO THE PEROXIDE WILL HELP BREAK DOWN THAT ORGANIC STAIN
GZwewfRheIs_10 0 WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PUT IT IN THERE AND LET IT SOAK FOR A LITTLE WHILE
GZwewfRheIs_11 0 AND IF YOU DO THIS WITH OXICLEAN YOU CAN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SEE THE STAIN GO AWAY
GZwewfRheIs_12 0 SO WE'LL SEE IF THAT HAPPENS FOR US TODAY
GZwewfRheIs_13 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND LET THAT SOAK AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S ALREADY STARTING TO COME OUT
GZwewfRheIs_14 0 RUB THE FABRIC TOGETHER AND IF YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AFTER THIS AND RUN IT IN A REGULAR WASH THE PEROXIDE WILL START TO BREAK DOWN THOSE ORGANIC STAINS AND IN ADDITION TO WINE ANY OTHER STAINS THAT ARE ORGANIC LIKE BLOOD OR OTHER PROTEIN BASED STAINS
GZwewfRheIs_15 0 PEROXIDE AND A LITTLE DISH SOAP WILL GET IT RIGHT OUT
GZwewfRheIs_16 0 THAT'S HOW TO GET WINE OUT OF WHITE CLOTHING
HEibb83JnGQ_1 0 SO LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW TO MARK YOUR LINE FOR THE DEPTH THAT YOU WANT TO FISH AT
HEibb83JnGQ_2 0 AND THIS IS USED WHEN YOU'RE USING TIP-UPS
HEibb83JnGQ_3 0 SO WE'VE SOUNDED OUR HOLE
HEibb83JnGQ_4 0 THE SOUNDER IS ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT NOW SO WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW DEEP IT IS
HEibb83JnGQ_5 0 SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO I'M GOING TO HOLD THAT LINE IN MY FINGER
HEibb83JnGQ_6 0 AND TYPICALLY WHEN YOU'RE ICE FISHING MOST PEOPLE FISH TWO THREE FOUR FEET OFF THE BOTTOM
HEibb83JnGQ_7 0 SO WE'VE GOT THAT
HEibb83JnGQ_8 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO ESTIMATE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FEET
HEibb83JnGQ_9 0 I'M GOING TO HOLD THAT
HEibb83JnGQ_10 0 I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO HOLD IT IN MY MOUTH BECAUSE IT'S EASIER
HEibb83JnGQ_11 0 AND THEN I'M GOING TO BRING UP MY LINE SET THAT ASIDE FOR NOW
HEibb83JnGQ_12 0 AND THIS IS THE DEPTH THAT I WANT TO FISH AT
HEibb83JnGQ_13 0 THIS IS WHERE I WANT THE LINE TO BE ON MY REEL
HEibb83JnGQ_14 0 SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THAT
HEibb83JnGQ_15 0 ONE YOU CAN TIE A VERY SIMPLE SLIP KNOT AND JUST REEL YOUR LINE UP TO THAT POINT
HEibb83JnGQ_16 0 HOWEVER WHEN A FISH TAKES IT OFTEN THAT KNOT COMES OUT
HEibb83JnGQ_17 0 SO THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT
HEibb83JnGQ_18 0 AND THAT ENTAILS JUST HAVING A SMALL BOBBER ON YOUR LINE THAT YOU PUT AT THE POINT WHERE YOU WANT TO FISH AT
HEibb83JnGQ_19 0 AND THEN THE OTHER OPTION SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY THREAD A BUTTON ONTO THEIR LINE
HEibb83JnGQ_20 0 THAT WORKS VERY WELL
HEibb83JnGQ_21 0 WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS JUST TO SIMPLY TIE THE SLIP KNOT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AND THEN JUST INSERT A MATCH STICK INTO IT
HEibb83JnGQ_22 0 AND TIGHTEN THAT KNOT DOWN
HEibb83JnGQ_23 0 AGAIN THAT'S WHERE YOU REEL YOUR LINE UP TO
HEibb83JnGQ_24 0 WHEN YOU CATCH A FISH AND YOU WANT TO RE-BAIT AND FISH SOME MORE YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT DEPTH YOU WERE FISHING AT AND WHERE YOU WANT TO SET THAT LINE OUT AGAIN
HEibb83JnGQ_25 0 WHEN YOU'RE DONE FOR THE DAY SLIP OUT THE MATCH STICK THROW IT AWAY TAKE OUT YOUR SLIP KNOT AND YOU'RE READY TO FISH THE NEXT TIME

gHCihKGrM5Q_10 0 YOU FOLLOW THE MERIDIAN LINES
gHCihKGrM5Q_11 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO USE LIKE A KIND OF A POKING KNEADING MOTION DOWN THE LINE OF THE FOOT AS WELL AS I LIKE TO KIND OF MOVE THE ENTIRE THE FOOT WORKING THE MERIDIANS AS WELL
gHCihKGrM5Q_12 0 AND AS I WORK MY WAY DOWN THE FOOT NEAR THE WAIST I'LL COME AT A SIDEWAYS MOTION AND THEN AS I WORK DOWN TOWARDS THE INTESTINES OR THE HEEL I'LL TAKE MY FIST AND KNUCKLE AND APPLY FIRM PRESSURE WITH ROTATING MOTION WHICH REALLY STIMULATES THE NEURAL IMPULSE AND FEELS PRETTY GOOD
gHCihKGrM5Q_13 0 AS I WORK HERE TRACY'S FOOT I GET SOME RESISTANCE IN HER ADRENALS WHICH LET'S ME KNOW EITHER THAT SHE'S NOT EXERCISING ENOUGH OR SHE'S EXERCISING TOO MUCH

guQb5VRZGrI_1 0 HI MY NAME IS WINDY AND THIS IS HOW TO PLAY SKIP-BO
guQb5VRZGrI_2 0 SKIP-BO IS A TWO TO SIX PERSON GAME THAT IS SORT OF LIKE A COMPETITIVE SOLITAIRE
guQb5VRZGrI_3 0 EVERYONE IS DEALT OUT THIRTY CARDS FROM THEIR DECK
guQb5VRZGrI_4 0 IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN FOUR PEOPLE YOU ONLY DEAL OUT TWENTY
guQb5VRZGrI_5 0 AFTER IT'S BEEN DEALT OUT YOU PUT THE REMAINDER OF THE DECK IN BETWEEN THE PLAYERS AND THAT'S THE DRAW
guQb5VRZGrI_6 0 I'VE PLACED EMPTY CARDS HERE TO SHOW YOU WHERE THE CARD PLAYING SLOTS WOULD BE BUT WHEN YOU PLAY THE GAME YOU WON'T BE PUTTING EMPTY CARDS OUT
guQb5VRZGrI_7 0 FIRST YOU DRAW FIVE CARDS FROM THE DECK
guQb5VRZGrI_8 0 THE THIRTY CARDS THAT WERE DEALT TO YOU ARE YOUR STOCKPILE
guQb5VRZGrI_9 0 THE GOAL OF THE GAME IS TO GET RID OF YOUR STOCKPILE BEFORE ANYONE ELSE SO WHEN YOU START YOUR TURN YOU TURN OVER THE FIRST CARD ON YOUR STOCKPILE
guQb5VRZGrI_10 0 THIS IS A SIX
guQb5VRZGrI_11 0 SKIP-BO HAS NUMBERED CARDS FROM ONE TO TWELVE AND SPECIAL SKIP-BO CARDS WHICH ARE WILD CARDS
guQb5VRZGrI_12 0 THERE WILL BE FOUR SLOTS IN BETWEEN THE TWO PLAYERS THAT ARE FOR STOCKPILING
guQb5VRZGrI_13 0 YOU CAN ONLY START A SLOT IF IT'S WITH A NUMBER ONE OR A SKIP-BO
guQb5VRZGrI_14 0 WHEN YOU PLAY THE SKIP-BO YOU ANNOUNCE WHAT NUMBER YOU WISH IT TO BE AND THEN PLAY AS THOUGH YOU HAD PLAYED THAT NUMBER SO THIS IS A SIX I SAY
guQb5VRZGrI_15 0 SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN AND SO FORTH UP UNTIL TWELVE
guQb5VRZGrI_16 0 ONCE YOU'VE REACHED TWELVE EITHER FROM STARTING WITH A NATURAL ONE OR WITH A SKIP-BO THEN THE CARD PILE IS TAKEN AWAY AND THERE'S A NEW SLOT OPEN TO START A NEW STOCKPILE
guQb5VRZGrI_17 0 IF YOU RUN OUT OF DRAW CARDS YOU CAN JUST SHUFFLE IN THE COMPLETED STOCKPILE OF CARDS AND KEEP DRAWING SO YOU MAY PLAY AS LONG AS YOU CAN PLAY ON ONE OF THESE FOUR PILES A SEQUENTIAL NUMBER
guQb5VRZGrI_18 0 YOU CAN PLAY EITHER OUT OF YOUR HAND OR OFF THE TOP OF YOUR STOCKPILE OR OFF YOUR DISCARD PILES IF YOU HAVE CARDS THAT YOU CAN PLAY
guQb5VRZGrI_19 0 IF YOU RUN OUT OF CARDS AND YOU MANAGE TO DO SUCCESSFUL STOCKPILES WITH THEM AND YOUR LAST TURN YOU ALREADY PLAYED ONE YOU CAN DRAW
guQb5VRZGrI_20 0 YOU CAN KEEP DRAWING UNTIL YOU CAN NO LONGER PLACE A CARD THEN YOUR TURN IS DONE
guQb5VRZGrI_21 0 AT THE END OF YOUR TURN YOU MUST DISCARD ONE CARD IN YOUR HAND
guQb5VRZGrI_22 0 IT GOES INTO ONE OF FOUR SLOTS ON YOUR DISCARD TABLE
guQb5VRZGrI_23 0 ORIGINALLY YOU START WITH NO CARDS SO YOU CAN HAVE UP TO FOUR OPEN AND AFTER THE FOURTH ONE YOU START PLACING YOUR DISCARDS ON TOP OF OTHER CARDS BUT THE ONLY CARDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR PLAY ARE THE ONES WHOSE FACE IS UP SO YOU CONTINUE IN THIS MANNER AND ANYONE CAN PLAY ONTO THE CENTER STOCKPILE CARDS AND YOU PLAY UP UNTIL TWELVE AND THEN YOU REMOVE IT AND YOU KEEP GOING UNTIL SOMEONE HAS RUN OUT OF THEIR STOCKPILE SO EVEN THOUGH YOU WANT TO USE YOUR DISCARD PILES REALLY THE STRATEGY IS TO GET RID OF YOUR STOCKPILE CARD THE MOST
guQb5VRZGrI_24 0 YOU'RE AIMING TO GET THE STOCKPILES IN THE MIDDLE TO A POINT WHERE YOU COULD USE YOUR STOCKPILE
guQb5VRZGrI_26 0 YOU CONTINUE UNTIL YOU'VE RUN OUT OF CARDS AND THEN YOU WIN AND THAT'S HOW YOU PLAY SKIP-BO
-gzSiPpBWL0_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO INSTALL THE TRAILER HITCH ONTO THE VEHICLE
-gzSiPpBWL0_2 0 YOU'RE GOING TO NEED YOUR BOLTS AND THE MOUNTING AND YOUR INSTRUCTIONS SO YOU CAN BE ABLE TO DO THIS PROPERLY
-gzSiPpBWL0_3 0 ONE THING I HAVEN'T MENTIONED IS YOU'LL PROBABLY NEED SOME LOCTITE
-gzSiPpBWL0_4 0 THIS IS SOMETHING YOU PROBABLY WON'T EVER TAKE OFF YOUR VEHICLE SO YOU'LL NEED SOME LOCTITE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT STAYS ON TIGHT AND THE BOLTS DON'T LOOSEN UP WHILE YOU'RE TOWING SOMETHING BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE REALLY BAD
-gzSiPpBWL0_5 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO INSTALL THIS TRAILER HITCH
-gzSiPpBWL0_6 0 WE'RE GOING TO LIFT IT UP AGAINST THE FRAME AND WE'LL PUT THE BOLTS IN PLACE
-gzSiPpBWL0_7 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET THEM TIGHT IMMEDIATELY ALL YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IS PUT THEM IN PLACE TO HOLD IT UP THERE
-gzSiPpBWL0_8 0 THAT'LL BE THE FIRST PART IN GETTING IT MOUNTED UP
-gzSiPpBWL0_9 0 I WANT TO PUT IT UP ON THE VEHICLE AND WHEN I LIFT IT UP IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO LIFT BECAUSE IT'S HEAVY
-gzSiPpBWL0_10 0 I'M FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE A LIFT HERE WHERE I HAVE THE VEHICLE UP IN THE AIR
-gzSiPpBWL0_11 0 IF YOU'RE AT HOME YOU MAY NOT HAVE A LIFT SO YOU MAY HAVE TO LAY ON THE GROUND AND PUT THIS UP UNDER THE VEHICLE WHILE YOU'RE LAYING ON YOUR BACK
-gzSiPpBWL0_12 0 WHICH IS NOT SUCH A BAD THING WHEN YOU'RE HAVING TO LIFT SOMETHING REALLY HEAVY
-gzSiPpBWL0_13 0 THERE YOU GO
GbASTlFeBD0_1 0 NOW THE NEXT THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO CUT AND INSTALL THIS DISCHARGE TUBE THAT COMES FROM THE FILL VALVE
GbASTlFeBD0_2 0 IT ATTACHES TO THIS PORT ON THE SIDE OF THE FILL VALVE AND GOES INTO THE OVERFLOW TUBE
GbASTlFeBD0_3 0 SO WE'LL FIGURE OUT HOW LONG WE NEED TO CUT THIS WE WANT TO GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA SLACK AND THEN WE'LL MARK IT WITH OUR FINGER
GbASTlFeBD0_4 0 TAKE A RAZOR KNIFE AND CUT IT TO LENGTH
GbASTlFeBD0_5 0 AND WE HAVE A PIN OR A CLIP THAT WE PUT ON THE SIDE ON THE TANK I'M SORRY ON THE SIDE OF THE FILL TUBE OR THE OVERFLOW TUBE
GbASTlFeBD0_6 0 INSTALL THE DISCHARGE HOSE IN THE PORT ON THE SIDE OF THE FILL TUBE BY PRESSING
GbASTlFeBD0_7 0 YOU HAVE TO WIGGLE IT A LITTLE BIT TO GET IT IN SEAT IT PROPERLY AND MAKE SURE IT'S IN FIRM ATTACH IT TO THE CLIP SO THAT IT'S SECURE
GbASTlFeBD0_8 0 NOW THE FUNCTION OF THIS IS WHEN YOU FLUSH THE TOILET WATER GOES DOWN THE OVERFLOW TUBE WHICH IN TURN GOES INTO THE TOILET
GbASTlFeBD0_9 0 ONCE THE TOILET FLUSHES AND A RUSH OF WATER GOES DOWN INTO THE TOILET IT SUCKS ALL THAT WATER THROUGH LIKE A VACUUM BASICALLY AND WHAT THIS FUNCTION DOES IS THAT IT HELPS TO FILL THE TOILET UP TO A REASONABLE LEVEL

H9f6TvAa5sk_2 0 WELL I DON'T KNOW WE HAVE A PROBLEM IN PERU ABOUT IT
H9f6TvAa5sk_3 0 FOR SOME REASON THERE MOST OF THE BATHROOMS ARE DIRTY NOT VERY ACCESSIBLE AND THE TOILET PAPER IS SO ROUGH
H9f6TvAa5sk_4 0 PLUS YOU DON'T EVER FLUSH THE TOILET PAPER IN THE TOILET
H9f6TvAa5sk_5 0 THERE IS A BASKET NEAR YOU WHERE YOU HAVE TO JUST DUMP THE PAPER
H9f6TvAa5sk_6 0 AND IF YOU GO TO AN OPEN TOILET I MEAN OPEN RESTROOM YOU'RE GOING TO FIND A GIGANTIC ONE OF THOSE LIKE INDUSTRIAL SIZE OF BUCKETS OF BARRELS FULL OF WATER SO YOU GRAB A BUCKET AND DUMP THE WATER AFTER YOU USE THE RESTROOM

HdTHup4E8gM_2 0 THIS IS DAVID JACKEL ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT CAUSES A COLD
HdTHup4E8gM_3 0 THERE ARE MANY MANY VIRUSES THAT CAUSE THE SYMPTOMS THAT WE CALL THE COMMON COLD WHICH IS WHY IT'S SO HARD TO FIGHT THE COLD
HdTHup4E8gM_4 0 BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT VIRUSES IT'S SO HARD TO COME UP WITH A VACCINE
HdTHup4E8gM_5 0 SO WHAT CAUSES US TO CATCH THIS VIRUS
HdTHup4E8gM_6 0 TWO THINGS WEAKEN IMMUNE SYSTEM AND EXPOSURE TO THE GERMS
HdTHup4E8gM_7 0 YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM CAN BE COMPROMISED BY VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING STRESS WHEN YOU'RE SO WORKED UP THAT YOUR BODY CAN'T PERFORMANCE NORMAL FUNCTIONS
HdTHup4E8gM_8 0 HAVING A LACK OF EXERCISE HAVING A POOR DIET WHICH IS WHY THESE ARE SO IMPORTANT AND ALSO ALLERGIC DISEASES
HdTHup4E8gM_9 0 TO ACTUALLY CATCH A COLD VIRUS THOUGH YOU HAVE TO BE EXPOSED TO IT WHICH MEANS IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THROUGH CLOSE CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE THE VIRUS IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THROUGH NOT VERY SANITARY CONDITIONS WHERE YOU ARE TOUCHING THINGS THAT HAVE GERMS ON THEM STUFF LIKE THAT
HdTHup4E8gM_10 0 SO THE TWO MAJOR FACTORS THAT ARE GOING TO CAUSE YOU TO HAVE A COLD ARE HAVING A WEAK IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THEN WITH THAT WEAK IMMUNE SYSTEM BEING EXPOSED TO GERMS
HdTHup4E8gM_11 0 SO IN ORDER TO PREVENT A COLD WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS BOAST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM AND REDUCE YOUR EXPOSURE TO GERMS

Gtjz2W4Omo4_1 0 OK OUR NEXT STEP NOW THAT WE'VE GOT OUR BOX PARTS PRETTY MUCH MADE AND PUT TOGETHER IS TO CHECK THE BOX FOR SQUARE AND WE'LL JUST USE OUR OUR FRAMING SQUARE HERE
Gtjz2W4Omo4_2 0 LAY IT UP AGAINST THE SIDE AROUND THE CORNER AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT THAT'S PRETTY GOOD
Gtjz2W4Omo4_3 0 IF THE BOX IS NOT SQUARE FOR INSTANCE IF IT'S LIKE THAT A LITTLE BIT LET'S SAY OUR BOX KIND OF LOOKED LIKE THAT
Gtjz2W4Omo4_4 0 IT WASN'T PARTICULARLY SQUARE
Gtjz2W4Omo4_5 0 YOU JUST WANT TO TAKE IT AND PUT IT ON ONE CORNER AND GIVE IT A WHACK
Gtjz2W4Omo4_6 0 PUT IT ON THE OTHER CORNER AND GIVE IT A WHACK AND MAKE SURE YOU GET IT SQUARE BEFORE YOU PUT ANY GLUE ON IT
Gtjz2W4Omo4_7 0 SEE WE'RE STILL A LITTLE BIT OUT OF SQUARE HERE OK THAT LOOKS GOOD
Gtjz2W4Omo4_8 0 THE NEXT STEP WILL BE TO ASSEMBLE THIS BOX SO WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT ALL OF OUR JOINTS
Gtjz2W4Omo4_9 0 THESE JOINTS LOOK PRETTY GOOD
Gtjz2W4Omo4_10 0 YOU CAN SEE JUST A TINY LITTLE BIT OF SPACE THERE BUT WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT RAISING THIS BLADE A LITTLE BIT
Gtjz2W4Omo4_11 0 SO WHEN YOU DO THAT WHEN YOU RAISE THE BLADE A LITTLE BIT MAKE SOME TEST CUTS TO MAKE SURE THESE JOINTS ARE ARE COMPLETELY SEATED DOWN HERE AT THE BOTTOM AND COMPLETELY SEATED HERE
Gtjz2W4Omo4_12 0 AND WHAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO ELIMINATE IS WHAT WE HAVE HERE WHICH WE GOT ON OUR FIRST TEST CUTS WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT OF UNEVENNESS
Gtjz2W4Omo4_13 0 A DON'T GO NUTS OVER IT BECAUSE PINE IS KIND OF CANTANKEROUS WOOD ANYWAY AND IT'LL BEND AND WARP DEPENDING ON THE WEATHER
Gtjz2W4Omo4_14 0 A WHEN YOU START MAKING THESE OUT OF REAL FINE HARDWOOD A YOU'LL SEE THAT THEY ARE THEY COME OUT A LOT MORE EXACT BUT THESE CAN BE JUST SANDED OFF REAL NICE AND A THEY'LL LOOK BEAUTIFUL
Gtjz2W4Omo4_15 0 SO BEFORE I GLUE THIS TOGETHER I'M JUST GOING TO HOLD IT TOGETHER WITH CLAMPS RIGHT NOW AND WE'LL DEMONSTRATE CUTTING OUT A RABBIT AROUND THE BOTTOM TO PUT THE BOTTOM IN THE BOX
Gtjz2W4Omo4_16 0 AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THAT WITH OUR LITTLE SMALL ROUTER AND I'M GOING TO GET THAT SET UP WITH A RABBITING BIT
Gtjz2W4Omo4_17 0 HANG ON BE RIGHT BACK
G5CdB_VcPwc_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS BARBARA CORADIN WITH ENERGY FITNESS IN NEW YORK CITY AND TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO TRAIN FOR A MARATHON
G5CdB_VcPwc_2 0 AGAIN OUR NEXT ABDOMINAL EXERCISE IS ALSO A EXERCISE I'M SORRY IT IS ALSO GOING TO BE A COMPOUND MOVEMENT
G5CdB_VcPwc_3 0 SO BASICALLY WE ARE GOING TO LAY FLAT ON OUR BACKS ONCE AGAIN OUR HANDS ARE BEHIND OUR HEAD ELBOWS ARE BACK SHIN IS UP
G5CdB_VcPwc_4 0 THE LEGS ARE GOING TO COME UP IN A NINETY DEGREES FEET TOGETHER WE ARE GOING TO CROSS THEM AND WE ARE GOING TO BRING THE CHEST UP AT THE SAME TIME BRINGING THE KNEES TO THE CHEST
G5CdB_VcPwc_5 0 SO WE CRUNCH AND RELEASE BREATH ON THE EXTENSION AND EXHALING AND INHALING
G5CdB_VcPwc_6 0 SO WE EXHALE AND INHALE
G5CdB_VcPwc_7 0 TO IF YOU ARE FEELING PAIN ON YOUR NECK YOU ARE DOING THE EXERCISE INCORRECTLY YOU SHOULD BE FEELING EVERYTHING IN THE ABDOMINALS AND WE WANT THINK ABS CHORD RELEASE
G5CdB_VcPwc_8 0 SO WE SQUEEZE THE GLUTES COME UP THE SHOULDERS COME OFF THE MAT LIPS ARE FACING THE CEILING
G5CdB_VcPwc_9 0 SO WE SQUEEZE AND RELEASE ELBOWS ARE BACK SQUEEZE AND DOWN SQUEEZE AND BACK DOWN HOLD IT HOLD IT AND RELEASE AND SQUEEZE YOU WOULD TYPICALLY DO FOUR SETS OF EIGHT
H1HAMTFXwqI_1 0 NEXT WE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT ANY PARTICULAR PROBLEMS THE CAT HAS AND SOME WAYS THAT WE COULD ADJUST THIS KITTY CAT'S BEHAVIOR SO THERE AREN'T PROBLEMS INVOLVED AT HOME
H1HAMTFXwqI_2 0 AS FAR AS CATS ARE CONCERNED THEY HAVE A TENDENCY TO BE DESTRUCTIVE AT THIS AGE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SHARPEN THEIR CLAWS AND EVERYTHING
H1HAMTFXwqI_3 0 AND SO THERE ARE SEVERAL APPROACHES THAT YOU CAN TAKE TO THAT
H1HAMTFXwqI_4 0 IS THIS CAT GOING TO BE AN INDOOR CAT
H1HAMTFXwqI_6 0 OK THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER TOPIC BUT CATS THAT STAY INSIDE LIVES TWICE AS LONG AS CATS THAT ARE OUTSIDE
H1HAMTFXwqI_7 0 CATS THAT ARE OUTSIDE CAN GET INTO ALL KINDS OF TROUBLE WITH COYOTES AND DOGS AND CARS AND A LOT OF TRAUMA OUTSIDE
H1HAMTFXwqI_8 0 BUT CATS THAT STAY INSIDE DON'T GET A LOT OF DISEASES
H1HAMTFXwqI_9 0 THEY ALSO DON'T GET A LOT OF TRAUMA SO I'M GLAD YOU'VE DECIDED TO DO THAT
H1HAMTFXwqI_10 0 SOMETIMES IT'S HARD WITH CATS THAT ARE INSIDE BECAUSE THEY CAN BE DESTRUCTIVE
H1HAMTFXwqI_11 0 AND SO I WANTED TO INTRODUCE YOU TO A FEW PRODUCTS THAT SOMETIMES REALLY CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT
H1HAMTFXwqI_12 0 WHEN THESE CATS START TO DO SOME CLAWING BEHAVIOR WITH INAPPROPRIATE OBJECTS IN THE HOUSE ONE THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME PLACE WHERE THEY CAN CLAW
H1HAMTFXwqI_13 0 AND SO IF YOU CATCH THEM CLAWING WHERE THEY ARE NOT WANTED YOU CAN EITHER TAKE SOME COINS AND PUT THEM IN A CAN AND JUST SHAKE IT AND THE CAT WILL STOP DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING
H1HAMTFXwqI_14 0 SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE A SQUIRT GUN AND SO WHAT YOU DO IS THE CAT SHOULD LEARN THAT NO MEANS STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND CHECK IN WITH WHOMEVER SAID NO
H1HAMTFXwqI_15 0 AND SO MY PHILOSOPHY IS FOR THE SCRATCHING BEHAVIOR IS THAT IT'S A REALLY REALLY GOOD IDEA TO TRY AND TRAIN THE CAT PROPERLY
H1HAMTFXwqI_16 0 AND SO IF YOU TRAIN YOUR CAT OUT OF IT THAT'S THE BEST WAY
H1HAMTFXwqI_17 0 IF YOUR CAT IS ONE OF THOSE CAT'S THAT'S JUST SO WILD AND YOU CAN NOT CONVERT HIM AND HE IS RUINING YOUR HOUSE THERE IS SOME MAYBE ONE OR TWO PERCENT OF CATS THAT WILL ACTUALLY RUIN YOUR HOUSE THEN I AM NOT AGAINST DE-CLAWING IF IT'S DONE RIGHT
H1HAMTFXwqI_18 0 DE CLAWING IS REALLY THOUGHT POORLY OF IN THE CAT WORLD BUT I THINK IT'S A LOT LESS TRAUMATIC TO LOSE THEIR CLAWS THEN TO BE THROWN OUTSIDE BECAUSE THEY'RE DESTRUCTIVE
H1HAMTFXwqI_19 0 SO IF HE GETS TO THE POINT WHERE YOU REALLY WANT TO THROW YOUR CAT OUTSIDE BECAUSE HE IS WRECKING YOUR HOUSE I'D RATHER HAVE HIM DE-CLAWED AND KEEP HIM FROM WRECKING YOUR HOUSE AND KEEP HIM INSIDE WHERE IT IS SAFE
hagDdYZ-fcQ_1 0 THE NEXT THING I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS TRACKS

gJ5PQCRPsXY_1 0 PLAYING THE CRASH SYMBOL IS VERY SIMILAR TO PLAYING THE RIDE SYMBOL EXCEPT LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE FIRST DRUM LESSON
gJ5PQCRPsXY_2 0 IT'S NOT REALLY USED AS A TIME KEEPER IT'S USED MOSTLY FOR ACCENTS AND YOU KNOW AT THE END OF BIG FILLS OR THE START OF A SONG OR YOU'LL HEAR AS YOU LISTEN TO MORE AND MORE MUSIC
gJ5PQCRPsXY_3 0 SO YOU CAN HIT IT WITH THE TIP OF THE STICK THE HEAD OF THE STICK
gJ5PQCRPsXY_4 0 IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS WITH THE WHOLE KIT
gJ5PQCRPsXY_5 0 AND YOU CAN GET A CLEAR STICK DEFINITION WITH THAT BUT WHEN YOU WANT TO CRASH I LIKE TO USE THE SHOULDER OF THE STICK
gJ5PQCRPsXY_6 0 CAUSE YOU ARE GETTING A MORE WASH SOUND AND MORE IN YOUR FACE HIT AND LIKE THE RIDE SYMBOL IT ALSO HAS A BELL I LIKE TO HIT WITH THE SHOULDER OF THE STICK BUT YOU CAN ALSO USE THE TIP OF IT
gJ5PQCRPsXY_7 0 AND YOU CAN HIT IT IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN HIT IT ON THE SIDE THAT PINGY SOUND YOU CAN MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A HORROR MOVIE
gJ5PQCRPsXY_8 0 IT'S KIND OF WEIRD RIGHT
gJ5PQCRPsXY_9 0 THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF YOU CAN DO THAT'S MESS AROUND SEE WHAT YOU COME UP WITH
gYrtN5415Vc_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM I'M JIM KOCH AND TODAY WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT GAINING ACCESS TO YOUR HOUSE OR GARAGE WHEN YOU HAVE LOCKED YOUR KEYS IN IT
gYrtN5415Vc_2 0 THESE ARE SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT ARE COMMONLY USED IN LOCKSMITHING
gYrtN5415Vc_3 0 SOME OF YOUR OLD SCHOOL PICKS POCKET PICK
gYrtN5415Vc_4 0 THESE ARE SOME OF THE NEWER STYLE PICKS
gYrtN5415Vc_5 0 THIS IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE WHICH IS CALLED A PICK GUN
gYrtN5415Vc_6 0 A PICK GUN WORKS BY USING AN IMPACT BY SLAMMING THE PINS UP
gYrtN5415Vc_7 0 BASICALLY YOU INSERT IT IN A LOCK AND GET A LITTLE SQUEEZE CAN'T HARDLY SEE THE MOVEMENT BUT IT DOES DO THE TRICK
gYrtN5415Vc_8 0 THEN YOU'VE GOT YOUR ASSORTMENT OF TENSION WRENCHES AND YOUR PLUG SPINNER
gYrtN5415Vc_9 0 YOU WILL SEE HERE SOME OF THE LOCK PICKS ARE COLOR CODED
gYrtN5415Vc_10 0 THE COLOR CODING IS KIND OF NICE BECAUSE IT LET'S YOU REMEMBER WHICH TIP IS WHICH BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T MEAN A WHOLE LOT AS YOU CAN SEE THE NEWER ONES ARE NOT COLOR CODED
gYrtN5415Vc_11 0 THIS PICK HERE IS MY FAVORITE AND IT IS BECAUSE IT FOLDS UP IN THE SIDE OF MY POCKET
gYrtN5415Vc_12 0 AT ANY GIVEN TIME OF DAY OR NIGHT YOU CAN FIND ONE OF THESE TOOLS IN MY POCKET
gYrtN5415Vc_13 0 THESE ARE SOME OF THE TENSION WRENCHES WE USE
gYrtN5415Vc_14 0 THE TENSION ON A LOCK IS VERY CRITICAL PART OF PICKING IT AND DEPENDING ON THE STYLE OF LOCK THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENT STYLES OF TENSION WRENCHES SOME ARE DOUBLE SIDED SOME ARE SINGLE SIDED SOME OF THEM HAVE A TWO PRONG SYSTEM AND IT JUST DEPENDS ON THE STYLE OF THE LOCK TO WHICH SIZE OF TENSION WRENCH WE WOULD USE
hj0r7FKbr5E_1 0 WHEN IT COMES TO SHOWING MOVEMENT THINK OF THE SHOULDERS THE ELBOWS AND THE WRIST THE HIPS EVERYTHING AS SWIVEL POINTS
hj0r7FKbr5E_2 0 AND THESE ARE THE AREAS OF THE BODY THAT SWING FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND GO UP AND DOWN
hj0r7FKbr5E_3 0 AS A RESULT YOU'LL FIND THAT THERE'S AN ARC THAT'S CREATED WHEN YOU WANT TO SHOW MOTION
hj0r7FKbr5E_4 0 I MEAN DON'T YOU DON'T DRAW THESE ARROWS ON HERE EVERY TIME
hj0r7FKbr5E_5 0 BUT THIS CAN SHOW LIKE WHEN YOU'RE FLIPPING THROUGH AND ANIMATED THING THESE ARROWS BASICALLY SHOW THE MOTION AND THE MOVEMENT THAT THE BODY'S GOING THROUGH AT THE SWIVEL POINTS
hj0r7FKbr5E_6 0 IF YOU KEEP THE POSITIONS OF THE ARM SIMPLE THEN THESE ARMS I ONLY DREW HALF OF THEM THEY CAN GO THEY'RE RIGHT DOWN BY THE SIDES HIT MID-THIGH BUT THEY CAN BE BROUGHT UP AND IT ALL GOES ALONG THE ARC
hj0r7FKbr5E_7 0 THE THE BODY MOVES THE KNEES ARE SWIVELING THAT WAY HIPS THAT WAY
hj0r7FKbr5E_8 0 ARMS IF THEY'RE RAISED THEY'RE GOING TO SWIVEL THE SAME
hj0r7FKbr5E_9 0 IT'S VERY VERY METHODICAL
hj0r7FKbr5E_10 0 THEY WILL GENERALLY BE AT MID-THIGH WHEN YOU DRAW THEM
hj0r7FKbr5E_11 0 YOU WANT TO KEEP THEM THERE FOR THE MOST PART
hj0r7FKbr5E_12 0 ANYTHING CONVOLUTED JUST DETRACTS FROM THE OVERALL FRAME OF REFERENCE OF YOUR DESIGN
H3ebjzrFzmU_1 0 WE'VE GOT A NICE HOT PAN ALMOST SMOKING
H3ebjzrFzmU_2 0 I'M GOING TO PUT SOME OIL
H3ebjzrFzmU_3 0 I'M JUST USING VEGETABLE OIL BUT I WANT THIS NICE AND HOT
H3ebjzrFzmU_4 0 I'LL TURN IT DOWN TO ABOUT A MEDIUM-HIGH HEAT
H3ebjzrFzmU_5 0 THE OIL IS JUST SORT OF DANCING ACROSS THE PAN WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANT FOR THIS TO SEAR BEAUTIFULLY
H3ebjzrFzmU_6 0 THAT'S THE NOISE YOU WANT TO HEAR
H3ebjzrFzmU_7 0 DON'T TOUCH IT YOU'RE GOING TO LET THAT GET A NICE CARAMELIZATION
H3ebjzrFzmU_8 0 I ACTUALLY CAN TELL WHEN IT'S TIME TO TURN AS I START TO HEAR THE SIZZLE GO DOWN A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THERE'S A TRANSFERENCE
H3ebjzrFzmU_9 0 YOU'VE TAKEN SOMETHING THAT'S COLD AND PUT IT INTO SOMETHING THAT'S HOT THE SIZZLE GETS REALLY EXCITED BUT AS THE MEAT STARTS TO CARAMELIZE AND BECOME THE SAME TEMPERATURE THE SIZZLE EASES OUT SO I CAN HEAR IT SLOWING DOWN A LITTLE BIT
H3ebjzrFzmU_10 0 I'M GOING TO TAKE A TINY LITTLE PEEK UNDERNEATH
H3ebjzrFzmU_11 0 OH YEAH IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL
H3ebjzrFzmU_12 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO FOR THE BACKSIDE AND AGAIN YOU CAN HEAR THAT SIZZLE IS REALLY HIGH AND AS IT STARTS TO WIND ITSELF DOWN I'LL KNOW THAT IT'S TIME TO TURN IT SO THAT I'VE GOT IT NICE AND CARAMELIZED ON ALL SIDES
H3ebjzrFzmU_13 0 THE TRICK WITH THIS AND THE CARAMELIZATION IS THAT ONCE I PUT IT INTO THE MARINADE THE MARINADE IS GOING TO COME AND DRINK INTO THAT CARAMELIZATION
H3ebjzrFzmU_14 0 THEN I PUT THE GLAZE OVER IT AND THEY'RE ALL GOING TO MARRY TOGETHER TO MAKE A WONDERFUL FLAVOR THROUGHOUT THIS ROAST
H3ebjzrFzmU_15 0 IT'S STARTING TO SIZZLE DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND I'LL GIVE IT ANOTHER LITTLE FLIP
H3ebjzrFzmU_16 0 IT'S REALLY GOOD TO HAVE A PAIR OF KITCHEN TONGS
H3ebjzrFzmU_17 0 THESE ARE MY BEST FRIEND
H3ebjzrFzmU_18 0 WE CHEFS ARE KNOWN FOR PUTTING OUR FINGERS IN HOT THINGS
H3ebjzrFzmU_19 0 I DON'T RECOMMEND IT TO YOU AT HOME BUT WE TEND TO DO IT
H3ebjzrFzmU_20 0 WE'VE BEEN KNOWN TO PICK UP MEAT AND TURN IT OVER IN A QUICK MOMENT OR TWO
H3ebjzrFzmU_21 0 THESE ARE REALLY GOOD THEY'LL SAVE YOUR FINGERS

hAZCtguzKCE_4 0 THIS IS A PHOTO OR A POSTER WITH A WHITE BACK A WHITE FOAM CORE BACK
hAZCtguzKCE_5 0 THIS IS A POSTER WITH THE BLACK FOAM CORE
hAZCtguzKCE_6 0 WHEN YOU ACTUALLY BUY THIS IT WILL COST MORE IF YOU GET IT IN A SMALLER SHEET
hAZCtguzKCE_7 0 THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS GOING TO A PAPER SUPPLY PLACE AND GETTING A NICE BIG SHEET
hAZCtguzKCE_8 0 THIS IS ONLY A HALF OF SHEET BUT NORMALLY YOU CAN GET THIS IN A FOUR FT X EIGHT FT SHEET OF FOAM CORE AND COSTS LESS THAN FIFTEEN DOLLARS GENERALLY FOR A SHEET LIKE THIS AT A PAPER SUPPLY PLACE
hAZCtguzKCE_9 0 IT'LL GET YOU PLENTY OF POSTERS
hAZCtguzKCE_10 0 IT'S DEFINITELY THE MOST ECONOMICAL WAY TO DO IT
hAZCtguzKCE_11 0 SOME ART SUPPLIES WILL HAVE THESE IN SMALLER PIECES BUT THEY WILL COST YOU A LOT MORE
Gtcd0XngMRc_1 0 MIKE LOPEZ HI
Gtcd0XngMRc_2 0 I'M MIKE LOPEZ WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING THE BLACK COLOR FROM MAGIC THE GATHERING
Gtcd0XngMRc_3 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS MARSH FLITTER
Gtcd0XngMRc_4 0 MARSH FLITTER IS A VERY POWERFUL CARD IS OUT OF THE LORWYN BLOCK IS AN UNCOMMON IT IS A CREATURE FAERIE ROGUE
Gtcd0XngMRc_5 0 NOW ONCE AGAIN THE LORWYN SET IS TRYING TO SPECIFICALLY BUILD UP THE CREATURE TYPES OF FAERIES AND MERFOLK AND COSTS YOU THREE AND A BLACK TO PLAY
Gtcd0XngMRc_6 0 THREE AND A BLACK TO PLAY AND YOU'RE PLAYING A 1/1
Gtcd0XngMRc_7 0 NOW ONCE AGAIN YOU'RE PAYING FOUR IN CONVERTED MANA COST FOR A 1/1 MEANS THERE'S GOING TO BE AT LEAST ONE REALLY COOL ABILITY OR A FEW REALLY COOL ABILITIES
Gtcd0XngMRc_8 0 NOW IN THIS CASE THIS CREATURE HAS FLYING MEANS IT CAN ONLY BE BLOCKED BY CREATURES WITH FLYING AND/OR REACH AND IT ALSO HAS WHEN MARSH FLITTER COMES INTO THE PLAY PUT TWO 1/1 BLACK GOBLIN ROGUE CREATURE TOKENS INTO PLAY
Gtcd0XngMRc_9 0 SO WHEN YOU PLAY HIM YOU'RE GETTING TWO EXTRA 1/1 CREATURES WHICH MEANS THAT BASICALLY GETTING THEIR EQUIVALENT OF A 3/3 WHICH MAKES THEM EVEN MANA PRODUCTION AND NOW YOU ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO GET A FREE ABILITY AS LONG AS FLYING IS ALSO A FREE ABILITY BUT YOU'RE GOING TO GET AN EXTRA FREE ABILITY AND THIS ABILITY IS SACRIFICING GOBLIN
Gtcd0XngMRc_10 0 MARSH FLITTER BECOMES A 3/3 UNTIL END OF TURN
Gtcd0XngMRc_11 0 SO NOW YOU CAN SACRIFICE A GOBLIN THAT CAME INTO PLAY TO MAKE HIM A 3/3 DURING ANY TURN YOU CHOOSE
Gtcd0XngMRc_12 0 IT'S A VERY POWERFUL CARD

HgZReSHdveQ_1 0 LET'S TALK NOW ABOUT HOW TO STORE YOUR HOOKS ON YOUR TIP-UP WHEN EITHER YOU'RE HOME OR YOU'RE ON THE ICE AND YOUR TIP-UP IS NOT IN USE
HgZReSHdveQ_2 0 YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE LINE DANGLING
HgZReSHdveQ_3 0 EVERYTHING IS GOING TO GET TANGLED
HgZReSHdveQ_4 0 ALL YOUR TIP-UPS WILL BE TANGLED TOGETHER WITH ALL OF YOUR OTHER EQUIPMENT
HgZReSHdveQ_5 0 THE OTHER THING YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS ACTUALLY PUT YOUR HOOK INTO YOUR LINE TO HOLD IT BECAUSE ALL YOU'RE DOING IS CREATING A WEAK SPOT ON YOUR LINE
HgZReSHdveQ_6 0 I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE AND OFTEN TIMES ALMOST COMPLETELY WENT THROUGH MY ICE FISHING LINE
HgZReSHdveQ_7 0 IT'S HARD TO GET THE HOOK OUT AND AGAIN IT CREATES A WEAK SPOT WHERE IF YOU DO GET A BIG FISH THAT'S GOING TO BE THE SPOT WHERE YOUR LINE BREAKS
HgZReSHdveQ_8 0 AS AN ALTERNATIVE YOU CAN SIMPLY PUT THE HOOK INTO THE WOODEN END OF THE TIP-UP
HgZReSHdveQ_9 0 NOW THAT'S A GOOD PLACE TO HOLD IT BUT WHAT THAT WILL DO OVER TIME IS DULL YOUR HOOK AND YOU ALWAYS WANT YOUR HOOKS AS SHARP AS POSSIBLE TO INCREASE YOUR HOOK UP RATES
HgZReSHdveQ_10 0 THERE'S A COUPLE OTHER METHODS
HgZReSHdveQ_11 0 YOU CAN PURCHASE STRAPS LIKE THIS THROUGH SOME SPECIALTY COMPANIES
HgZReSHdveQ_12 0 THE HOOK SIMPLY GOES IN THERE'S VELCRO YOU WIND IT AWAY FROM YOU AND THERE
HgZReSHdveQ_13 0 YOUR HOOK IS CONTAINED
HgZReSHdveQ_14 0 IT'S NOT EXPOSED SO IT'S NOT GOING TO CATCH ON ANYTHING
HgZReSHdveQ_15 0 YOUR LINE ISN'T GOING TO COME OUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET TANGLES
HgZReSHdveQ_16 0 NOW A CHEAPER AND EASIER METHOD IS SIMPLY TO USE A RUBBER BAND
HgZReSHdveQ_17 0 THE HOOK GOES AROUND THE RUBBER BAND
HgZReSHdveQ_18 0 YOU TWIST IT ONCE OR TWICE HOLD IT STEADY BRING IT BACK A COUPLE TIMES SIMPLY TWIST IT BRING IT OVER THE LINE AND YOUR HOOK IS SECURED
HgZReSHdveQ_19 0 IT'S NOT GOING TO TANGLE IT'S NOT GOING TO DAMAGE YOUR EQUIPMENT AND IT'S NOT GOING TO DAMAGE THE HOOK
gowPswqnQdQ_1 0 LADY J HERE AND WE ARE MOLDING CHOCOLATE

Gcex1u2Zc4k_1 0 HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED HOW TO CHEAT AT DICE
Gcex1u2Zc4k_2 0 MY NAME IS DEAN HALE AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF WAYS YOU CAN DO THAT
Gcex1u2Zc4k_3 0 THE FIRST AND EASIEST WAY IS JUST TO BUY A PAIR OF TRICK DICE FROM A LOCAL CRAFT STORE
Gcex1u2Zc4k_4 0 THE BEST PLACE IS PROBABLY A MAGIC STORE BECAUSE THEY USUALLY CARRY TRICK DICE WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY ROLL THE DICE AND END UP ROLLING SEVENS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT
Gcex1u2Zc4k_5 0 A COUPLE OF OTHER WAYS YOU CAN DO THAT IS YOU CAN ACTUALLY DRILL IN TO THE PIPS ON THE DICE USING A DRILL
Gcex1u2Zc4k_6 0 DON'T HOLD THE DICE IN YOUR HAND PUT IT IN A VISE
Gcex1u2Zc4k_7 0 DRILL DOWN AND YOU COULD ACTUALLY ADD SOME LEAD WEIGHTS INTO THE DICE SO IT WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO LAND ON THAT SIDE
Gcex1u2Zc4k_8 0 ANOTHER THING YOU COULD DO IS YOU COULD ACTUALLY TAKE THE DICE PUT IT IN AN OVEN FIND THE OPTIMUM TEMPERATURE TO DO SO AND THE DICE WILL ACTUALLY MELT AND SOME OF THE MATERIAL WILL ACTUALLY POOL UP ON THE BOTTOM THUS MAKING THAT SIDE OF THE DIE HEAVIER
Gcex1u2Zc4k_9 0 AGAIN GIVING IT MORE OF A PROBABILITY TO LAND ON THAT SIDE
Gcex1u2Zc4k_10 0 ANOTHER THING YOU CAN DO IS YOU CAN LEARN AND THIS IS ACTUALLY TECHNICALLY NOT ILLEGAL AT THE CASINOS IS YOU CAN LEARN HOW TO HOLD THE DICE IN A CERTAIN WAY SO THAT WHEN YOU ROLL AND YOU FLICK IT IN A CERTAIN FASHION IT WILL COME UP THE NUMBER YOU WANT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT
Gcex1u2Zc4k_11 0 THIS TAKES HOURS AND HOURS OF PRACTICE
Gcex1u2Zc4k_12 0 ALTHOUGH NOT TECHNICALLY ILLEGAL IF A CASINO CATCHES YOU DOING IT THEY WILL ASK YOU TO STEP AWAY FROM THE TABLE HOPEFULLY WITH LOTS OF MONEY
Gcex1u2Zc4k_13 0 MY NAME IS DEAN HALE AND I JUST TAUGHT YOU HOW TO CHEAT AT DICE
HEMswVRdMwI_1 0 HI I'M STEPHANIE BARNETT HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE

HEMswVRdMwI_3 0 NOW I WANT YOU TO TAKE YOUR ONION
HEMswVRdMwI_4 0 YOU ARE GOING TO CUT OFF THE TOP YOU ARE GOING TO CUT OFF THE BOTTOM AND YOU ARE GOING TO CUT IT IN HALF
HEMswVRdMwI_5 0 THEN YOU ARE GOING TO JUST PEEL THE SKIN OR MAYBE EVEN A FIRST LAYER OF THE ONION BECAUSE SOMETIMES ITS GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A SKIN AND A BROWN ON THERE
HEMswVRdMwI_6 0 THEN YOU ARE GOING TO SLICE DOWN
HEMswVRdMwI_7 0 SO YOU'VE GOT THE ONION ALL TOGETHER AND THEN YOU ARE GOING TO SLICE IT THIS WAY
HEMswVRdMwI_8 0 TRIM THE ONIONS IT IS EASIER TO SLICE
HEMswVRdMwI_9 0 NOW THAT IS A PRETTY COARSE CHOP
HEMswVRdMwI_10 0 I WANT IT A LITTLE BIT FINER FOR MY SOUP SO I AM GOING TO GO BACK WITH MY KNIFE
HEMswVRdMwI_11 0 I AM GOING TO KEEP THE TIP OF MY KNIFE ON THE TABLE AND I AM GOING TO LIFT UP GOING TO PUSH THE ONION TOGETHER AND DO THE SAME THING
HEMswVRdMwI_12 0 YOU WANT TO KEEP CHOPPING IT UNTIL YOU GET THE SIZE THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AND YOU WANT IT TO BE ALL UNIFORMED
HEMswVRdMwI_13 0 AND SEE THERE WAS SORT OF A PIECE OF PAPERY OUTSIDE THAT GOT IN THERE LET'S GET THAT OUT
HEMswVRdMwI_14 0 NOBODY LIKES THAT IN THEIR SOUP
HEMswVRdMwI_15 0 THEY'LL TASTE IT AND GO WHAT'S THAT AND THAT'S IT
gb0k8a2dHVo_1 0 WHEN CHOOSING A GLAZE FOR YOUR FINAL PIECE OF CERAMICS THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER
gb0k8a2dHVo_2 0 ONE OF THE THINGS ARE HOW YOUR COLORS ARE GOING TO INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER
gb0k8a2dHVo_3 0 FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU CHOOSE A GLAZE FOR INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR HOW THEY LOOK ONCE THEY'RE FINAL
gb0k8a2dHVo_4 0 SO WHEN YOU HAVE A LIDDED PIECE AND YOU OPEN IT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THESE TWO COLORS GO WELL TOGETHER
gb0k8a2dHVo_5 0 SO WHAT I DO IN MY STUDIO IS I'LL USUALLY MARK ON THE SURFACE OF THE GLAZES THAT I LIKE
gb0k8a2dHVo_6 0 I ALSO TRY TO STAY ORGANIZED AND PUT THEM IN ORDER
gb0k8a2dHVo_7 0 BUT I LIKE A LOT OF EARTH TONES AND BLUES
gb0k8a2dHVo_8 0 I DO A LOT OF OCEAN INSPIRED ARTWORK SO A LOT OF MY COLORS COME FROM NATURE AND THE OCEANS AND THE WATERS AND SO THAT'S HOW I'VE DECIDED ON THESE
gb0k8a2dHVo_9 0 I'VE GOT MIDNIGHT SKY DESERT WHICH IS JUST LIKE IT SAYS A DESERT COLOR
gb0k8a2dHVo_10 0 THEY'RE USUALLY PRETTY TRUE TO THE COLOR
gb0k8a2dHVo_11 0 WHEAT FIELD IT'S LIKE A LIGHT BEIGE WHICH IS CLOSE TO THE OTHER ONE AND THE TEAL BLUE
gb0k8a2dHVo_12 0 SO THESE ARE MY FAVORITE CHOICES
gb0k8a2dHVo_13 0 TESTERS IN YOUR STUDIO AGAIN ARE REALLY KEY
gb0k8a2dHVo_14 0 SO I WOULD REFERENCE PIECES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN GLAZED WITH THESE COLORS TO HELP ME DECIDE AS WELL
Gno-3QAxbt8_1 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE A BASIC SWIRL
Gno-3QAxbt8_2 0 TO MAKE A BASIC SWIRL YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE PLIABLE OF A WIRE
Gno-3QAxbt8_3 0 YOU'RE GOING TO GRAB YOUR WIRE AT THE END AND START MAKING THAT SAME CURVING MOTION THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING
Gno-3QAxbt8_4 0 EACH TIME YOU CURVE IT AROUND YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO KIND OF MASH DOWN THE WIRE A BIT
Gno-3QAxbt8_5 0 IF YOU DON'T HAVE FLAT BASED PLIERS THEN YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO USE YOUR FLAT WIRES
Gno-3QAxbt8_6 0 YOU MAY HAVE TO SWITCH HANDS A BIT
Gno-3QAxbt8_7 0 WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS AS YOU'RE TURNING IT AROUND
Gno-3QAxbt8_8 0 I'LL JUST USE MY FLAT PLIERS FOR THIS
Gno-3QAxbt8_9 0 AS YOU'RE TURNING IT AROUND YOU'RE GOING TO USE YOUR THUMB AS A GUIDE
Gno-3QAxbt8_10 0 YOU'RE JUST GOING TO KEEP TURNING AND TURNING AND MUSHING DOWN AS YOU'RE TURNING
Gno-3QAxbt8_11 0 DEPENDING ON THE QUALITY OF THE WIRE OR THE DELICACY OF THE WIRE IS HOW HARD YOU'RE GOING TO PUSH
Gno-3QAxbt8_12 0 THE MORE DELICATE THE WIRE THE LESS HARD YOU WANT TO PUSH BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH MARKS ON YOUR SWIRL
Gno-3QAxbt8_13 0 JUST KEEP GOING AROUND
Gno-3QAxbt8_14 0 YOU CAN MAKE THIS WHIRL AS BIG OR AS SMALL AS YOU WANT TO
Gno-3QAxbt8_15 0 YOU CAN MAKE IT AS TIGHT OR AS LOOSE AS YOU WOULD LIKE
Gno-3QAxbt8_16 0 HERE WE HAVE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT STYLES OF SWIRLS
Gno-3QAxbt8_17 0 THIS A VERY LOOSE ONE OBVIOUSLY AND IT CAN BE USED AS A HOOK
Gno-3QAxbt8_18 0 THEN WE HAVE SOME TIGHTER ONES
Gno-3QAxbt8_19 0 THIS CAN BE USED AS A HOOK OR A PENDANT HOLDER
Gno-3QAxbt8_20 0 THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE THE BASIC SWIRL
-ghr7KEgAa8_1 0 WHAT WE WANT TO DO NOW IS ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT COMPONENTS OF A QUALITY BOAT
-ghr7KEgAa8_2 0 SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A QUALITY BOAT IS THE THICKNESS OF THE UPHOLSTERY
-ghr7KEgAa8_3 0 THE THICKER THE UPHOLSTERY IS AND THE MORE YOU CAN FEEL IT AND PULL ON IT AND IT GOES RIGHT BACK TO NORMAL NEW USE IS GOING TO SHOW YOU YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BETTER QUALITY PRODUCT
-ghr7KEgAa8_4 0 IF YOU LOOK AT THE DASH AND THE GAUGES SOME OF THE GAUGES ON BOATS ARE QUALITY AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE GLASS GAUGES STAINLESS STEEL BEZELS
-ghr7KEgAa8_5 0 IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ALL PLASTIC
-ghr7KEgAa8_6 0 YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE NICE ILLUMINATED ROCKER SWITCHES WHICH WILL ACTUALLY SHOW YOU WHEN THE PRODUCT'S ON OR OFF
-ghr7KEgAa8_7 0 ANOTHER NICE FEATURE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IN THE QUALITY BOATS NOWADAYS IS THE SNAP OUT CARPET
-ghr7KEgAa8_8 0 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SNAP OUT CARPET YOU WANT TO FEEL THE THICKNESS OF IT
-ghr7KEgAa8_9 0 WE USE FORTY OUNCE BERBER CARPET
-ghr7KEgAa8_10 0 A LOT OF THE INDUSTRY ONLY USES TWENTY-EIGHT OUNCE
-ghr7KEgAa8_11 0 WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THICKER STUFF LIKE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR TRIPLE STITCH BACKING ON THE VINYL
-ghr7KEgAa8_12 0 THESE ARE LITTLE SIGNS AND UH THINGS YOU'RE GOING TO NOTICE ON A LESS EXPENSIVE OR A LESS QUALITY BOAT THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND OUT THERE
ggJJk3ZBPVk_1 0 DEALING WITH THE FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF TRAVELING IS INEVITABLE
ggJJk3ZBPVk_2 0 I SUGGEST CALLING ALL OF YOUR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BEFORE YOU HIT THE ROAD

ggJJk3ZBPVk_15 0 IF YOU'RE IN THE MARKET YOUR BARGAINING AND HAGGLING WITH SOMEBODY YOU CAN JUST SHOW THEM THE NUMBER AND SAVE EVERYONE A LOT OF CONFUSION
ggJJk3ZBPVk_17 0 THAT'S EVERYONE'S FAVORITE TRAVEL ACCESSORY
ggJJk3ZBPVk_18 0 YOU CAN WEAR THEM ON YOUR WAIST AROUND YOUR NECK AROUND YOUR LEG
ggJJk3ZBPVk_19 0 WHEREVER YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR VALUABLES
ggJJk3ZBPVk_20 0 ALSO I THINK THAT EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE HAVE A LITTLE PHOTO OF YOURSELF READY TO GO BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU MAY NEED A VISA GET VISA MADE OR TO A PARTICULAR ENTRANCE SOMEWHERE
ggJJk3ZBPVk_21 0 LIKE ANCHOR WHAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR PHOTO ON YOUR PASS OR THE PARIS METRO
ggJJk3ZBPVk_22 0 JUST BE PREPARED
ggJJk3ZBPVk_23 0 ALSO IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN COLLEGE OR STILL FALL INTO THE STUDENT REALM ALWAYS GOOD TO BRING YOUR COLLEGE ID OR INTERNATIONAL STUDENT CARD
ggJJk3ZBPVk_24 0 YOU CAN GET DISCOUNTS MUSEUMS AND PARKS AND PLACES LIKE THAT

ggJJk3ZBPVk_30 0 YOUR PASSPORT KEEP THAT ON YOU AT ALL TIMES AND HAVE COPIES OF IT EVERYWHERE
ggJJk3ZBPVk_31 0 A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU CHECK INTO A HOTEL YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM YOUR PASSPORT
ggJJk3ZBPVk_32 0 I LIKE TO GIVE THEM A COPY OF IT IF THEY'LL TAKE THAT
ggJJk3ZBPVk_33 0 ALSO I FIND HAVING THE GOOD OLD AMERICAN DOLLAR ON YOU NEVER HURTS BECAUSE YOU GET IN A PICKLE IT SEEMS TO WORK
ggJJk3ZBPVk_34 0 I JUST GOT BACK FROM SOUTHEAST ASIA AND IT HELPED TO HAVE A LOT OF SMALL BILLS BECAUSE VERY CONVENIENTLY A LOT OF TAXI DRIVERS OR VENDORS THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE CHANGE FOR YOU
ggJJk3ZBPVk_35 0 JUST BE PREPARED AND EVERYTHING SHOULD BE FINE
_G7tWX0egAU_1 0 SO BEFORE YOU GO ANYWHERE ON THE RIVER WITH A CANOE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A FEW ESSENTIAL ITEMS WITH YOU
_G7tWX0egAU_2 0 THE FIRST AND MOST ESSENTIAL ITEM OF ALL IS YOUR PFD YOUR PERSONAL FLOTATION DEVICE
_G7tWX0egAU_3 0 THIS IS A UH LIFE JACKET SOMETHING THAT YOU WEAR AS A VEST YOU WANT TO GET ONE THAT'S COMFORTABLE THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOU IF YOU IF YOU FALL OUR OF YOUR BOAT OR YOU GO SWIMMING AND VIRTUALLY ALL OF THESE ARE COAST GUARD APPROVED SO THAT THE U.S COAST GUARD APPROVES THE VEST BASED ON THEIR DESIGN BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF FLOTATION THAT THEY HAVE IN THEM AND YOU'LL SEE THAT IN THE INSIDE OF THE BACK OF EVERY VEST THERE'S A COAST GUARD APPROVED INSIGNIA AND THAT WILL TELL YOU WHAT TYPE IT IS
_G7tWX0egAU_4 0 THESE ARE TYPE THREE UM OR TYPE 3.5 AND TYPE THREE OR TYPE 3.5 ARE THE KIND YOU WANT TO USE FOR WHITEWATER CANOEING GENERALLY
_G7tWX0egAU_5 0 THE OTHER BENEFIT OF THE VEST IS THAT THEY PROTECT YOUR BACK AND YOUR SPINE FROM AN IMPACT IF YOU GO SWIMMING AND THEY ALSO GIVE YOU SOME WARMTH SO IF IT'S COLD OUT WEARING YOUR LIFE VEST ACTUALLY CAN KEEP YOU WARMER BECAUSE THEY HAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF INSULATION IN THEM
_G7tWX0egAU_6 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR LIFE VEST FITS PROPERLY AND ONE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO WHEN YOU PUT IT ON CINCH DOWN ALL THE STRAPS THIS HAPPENS TO BE A RESCUE VEST SO I HAVE A QUICK RELEASE TOW HARNESS ON IT AS WELL WHICH I CINCHED DOWN AND THEN HAVE EITHER YOURSELF OR A FRIEND LIFT YOU UP BY THE SHOULDERS AND IF YOU COME WITH THE VEST THAT'S GOOD THAT MEANS THAT IT'S ON NICE AND SNUGGLY IF YOU DON'T IF THE VEST COME UP AND STARTS TO RIDE UP TO YOUR EARS OR RIDES UP IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE IT'S ON TOO LOOSELY AND YOU WANT TO TIGHTEN IT UP BECAUSE IF YOU GO FOR A SWIM YOU WANT TO BE IN THE VEST YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE VEST COMING OFF YOU AND YOU HAVE TO EITHER PULL IT BACK ON OR LOSE IT
_G7tWX0egAU_7 0 THE OTHER MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF SAFETY GEAR FOR WHITEWATER CANOEING IS A HELMET AND IF YOU HAVE A GOOD HELMET THAT FITS YOUR HEAD WELL AND IT'LL STAY ON WELL IT'LL PROTECT YOUR HEAD FROM THOSE OCCASIONAL BUMPS ON ROCKS WHEN YOU FLIP OUT OF YOUR BOAT OR EVEN FROM YOUR T-GRIP IF IT HAPPENS TO ERRANTLY HIT YOU IN THE HEAD WHICH THEY DO OCCASIONALLY DO
_G7tWX0egAU_8 0 THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF HELMETS UM THIS ONE'S FOR PEOPLE WITH A MORE ROUND HEAD UM THIS ONE GIVES YOU A LITTLE MORE PROTECTION IT HAS SOME EAR FLAPS AND IS PRETTY TOUGH
_G7tWX0egAU_9 0 BUT DEPENDING ON WHERE WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GO AND WHAT YOUR WHAT KIND OF NEEDS YOU HAVE YOU CAN CHOOSE A DIFFERENT KIND OF HELMET BUT MAKE SURE IT FITS WELL AND MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU'RE ON WHITEWATER YOU DO HAVE THE HELMET WITH YOU
Gj09MW3k2uE_1 0 HI MY NAME IS BOB LINDE AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THE NEXT MOVE IN THE TWENTY FOUR YANG STYLE TAI CHI SET
Gj09MW3k2uE_2 0 I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN PRACTICING TAI CHI FOR ABOUT THIRTEEN YEARS NOW
Gj09MW3k2uE_3 0 SO WE JUST SAW THE CREEP LOW LIKE SNAKE AND THE GOLDEN ROOSTER STANDS ON ONE LEG
Gj09MW3k2uE_4 0 WE'RE PRETTY MUCH GOING TO DO THAT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AS WHAT WE DID BEFORE
Gj09MW3k2uE_5 0 SO WE FINISHED OFF WITH GOLDEN ROOSTER SO OUR RIGHT KNEE IS UP AND OUR LEFT HAND IS DOWN
Gj09MW3k2uE_6 0 PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THIS MOVEMENT IS ACTUALLY WHAT WE CALL A LITTLE STUTTER STEP WHERE WE DO TO GET OURSELVES READY FOR THE NEXT MOVE
Gj09MW3k2uE_7 0 WE ARE GOING TO GO DOWN TO CREEP LOW LIKE SNAKE AGAIN SO WE GO FROM HERE WE ARE GOING TO TOUCH THE FOOT DOWN AND PIVOT OUR LEFT FOOT
Gj09MW3k2uE_8 0 WE NOW HAVE OUR SINGLE WHIP WE CAN STEP OUT AND DROP THE RIGHT HAND LIKE WE DID BEFORE
Gj09MW3k2uE_9 0 THE WEIGHT SHIFTS BACK AND NOW WE HAVE OUR CREEP LOW LIKE SNAKE
Gj09MW3k2uE_10 0 SO LET ME SHOW YOU THAT ONE MORE TIME
Gj09MW3k2uE_11 0 AND I'M GOING TO DO IT FACING THE CAMERA THIS TIME
Gj09MW3k2uE_12 0 SO WE START WITH OUR LEFT HAND DOWN OUR RIGHT KNEE UP AND WE ARE BASICALLY GOING TO HAVE OUR NICE LITTLE STUTTER STEP NOW AS WE PIVOT OUR LEFT FOOT
Gj09MW3k2uE_13 0 WE CAN GET DOWN TO OUR SINGLE WHIP WE SLIDE OUR FOOT OUT THE HAND SCOOPS DOWN THE WEIGHT SHIFTS BACK AND WE'VE GOT CREEP LOW LIKE SNAKE
Gj09MW3k2uE_14 0 SO REMEMBER TO FIND A GOOD TAI CHI INSTRUCTOR IN YOUR AREA TO TEACH YOU ONE OF THE MANY TAI CHI FORMS AND ENJOY PLAYING TAI CHI
hJG1GZ5HBso_1 0 OKAY SO LET'S SAY WE'VE DONE THE CORNERS A COUPLE OF TIMES
hJG1GZ5HBso_2 0 NOTHING BETTER THAN KNOWING THAT YOU DON'T HAVE COBWEBS UP IN THE CORNERS OF YOUR BATHROOMS OR IN ANY ROOM FOR THAT MATTER
hJG1GZ5HBso_3 0 BUT NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THE LIGHTS CAUSE WHEN I WAS UP THERE I SAW THERE WAS A LOT OF DUST
hJG1GZ5HBso_4 0 SO WHAT I WILL DO IS TURN THE LIGHTS OFF BECAUSE YOU DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT TO BE CLEANING LIGHTS THAT ARE HOT
hJG1GZ5HBso_5 0 NOW THIS IS WHERE I WOULD CHANGE THE BULB IF ONE OF THEM HAD GONE AND THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS CARRY THAT EXTRA BULB IN MY CARRIER
hJG1GZ5HBso_6 0 SO UP HERE YOU CAN'T OBVIOUSLY DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO SEE BUT THERE'S COBWEBS RIGHT HERE
hJG1GZ5HBso_7 0 I CAN SEE A COUPLE OF COBWEBS STRINGING FROM LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT BULB
hJG1GZ5HBso_8 0 SO I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE MY CLOTH
hJG1GZ5HBso_9 0 I'M NOT GOING TO GO NEAR THE OUTLET CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO RISK GETTING THAT WET WHERE THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTION IS AT ALL SO I'M JUST GOING ALONG THE TOP AND THERE'S A LOT
hJG1GZ5HBso_10 0 CAN YOU SEE THAT
hJG1GZ5HBso_11 0 THERE'S A LOT OF BUILDUP THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE YOU IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T SEE AND SO YOU DON'T CLEAN IT RIGHT
hJG1GZ5HBso_12 0 YOU SEE ONLY THIS KIND OF CLEANING IS CLEANING THAT YOU DON'T SEE BUT IT IT IT CERTAINLY BUILDS UP
hJG1GZ5HBso_13 0 SO I'M JUST GOING TO GO OVER EACH OF THE LIGHT BULB HOLDERS AND GET OFF ALL THAT DUST OKAY
gKpYu50LLps_1 0 WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT BLOOD PRESSURE IS
gKpYu50LLps_2 0 BLOOD PRESSURE IS DIVIDED INTO SYSTOLIC PRESSURE AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURE AND THOSE PRESSURES REPRESENT DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE CARDIAC CYCLE
gKpYu50LLps_3 0 WHEN YOU GET YOUR RECORDING YOU MAY GET 120/80
gKpYu50LLps_4 0 THAT TOP NUMBER IS YOUR SYSTOLIC PRESSURE AND THE BOTTOM NUMBER IS YOUR DIASTOLIC PRESSURE AND WHAT THOSE PRESSURES REPRESENT IS A PRESSURE WITHIN THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM
gKpYu50LLps_5 0 THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM WHICH IS THE AORTA AND THIS IS A REPRESENTATION OF THE PRESSURE IN THE AORTA WHEN YOU TAKE SOMEONE'S BLOOD PRESSURE
gKpYu50LLps_6 0 SO THE SYSTOLIC PRESSURE IS THE PRESSURE WITHIN THE AORTA JUST AFTER THAT HEART CONTRACTS
gKpYu50LLps_7 0 THIS AORTA IS FILLED UP WITH HIGHER AMOUNTS OF PRESSURE
gKpYu50LLps_8 0 SO IT'S THE PRESSURE WITHIN THE AORTA OR THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM MORE SO THE BRACHIAL ARTERY AFTER THAT HEART CONTRACTS
gKpYu50LLps_9 0 THE DIASTOLIC PRESSURE IS THE PRESSURE WITHIN THAT ARTERIAL SYSTEM JUST AFTER THE HEART RELAXES SO WE HAVE CONSTANT CONTRACTION RIGHT HERE IN THIS VENTRICLE SHOOTS BLOOD UP THROUGH THE AORTA AND THEN IT RELAXES
gKpYu50LLps_10 0 THE PRESSURE DECREASES SO THAT'S WHY THE DIASTOLIC IS A LITTLE BIT LOWER
gKpYu50LLps_11 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE AN ACTUAL PATIENT EXAMPLE AND SEE HOW THESE PRESSURES RELATE TO SOMEONE'S ACTUAL READING
gRVy0hUDTgI_2 0 I'M MIKE BECKS I'M WITH LEADERBOARD TOURNAMENT SYSTEMS OF ORLANDO AND WE'RE HERE AT BEAUTIFUL METROWEST GOLF COURSE IN ORLANDO ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE

goWKrbjr5po_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE PRIOR AND AFTERCARE FOR LIPOSUCTION
goWKrbjr5po_2 0 AFTER THE TOPOGRAPHIC MARKING AND THE SURGERY HAS BEEN COMPLETED WHICH TYPICALLY WILL TAKE ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO THREE HOURS
goWKrbjr5po_3 0 THE PATIENT IS SENT HOME IN A COMPRESSION GARMENT AND A COMPRESSION GARMENT IS DESIGNED FOR SEVERAL FACTORS
goWKrbjr5po_4 0 ONE TO MAKE THE PATIENT MORE COMFORTABLE
goWKrbjr5po_5 0 TWO TO DECREASE SWELLING AND THREE TO HELP SHAPE THE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN CONTOURED
goWKrbjr5po_6 0 AND A COMPRESSION GARMENT IS REALLY A GIRDLE SIMPLY A GIRDLE WITH A STRETCHY ELASTIC MATERIAL THAT HAS ZIPPERS AND CLIPS AND ALLOWS THE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN TREATED TO REMAIN UNDER SOME DEGREE OF COMPRESSION TO HELP AS STATED WITH SHAPING AND DECREASING SWELLING
goWKrbjr5po_7 0 PATIENTS WILL WEAR THEIR GARMENTS FOR APPROXIMATELY THREE TO SIX WEEKS AFTER SURGERY
goWKrbjr5po_8 0 OF COURSE REMOVING THEM TO SHOWER AND THEN THERE ARE LIGHTER GARMENTS THAT ARE MORE COMFORTABLE THAT THEY WILL GET INTO AFTER THEY HAVE THEIR OFFICE VISITS
goWKrbjr5po_9 0 THE TYPICAL OFFICE VISITS WILL BE FIRST AT ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE DAYS TO CHECK ON THE PATIENT AND SEE HOW THEY'RE DOING
goWKrbjr5po_10 0 WE DO ENCOURAGE PATIENTS TO SHOWER AT ABOUT TWO TO THREE DAYS
goWKrbjr5po_11 0 REMOVE THE GARMENT AND THEN WASH IT AND REAPPLY THE GARMENT OR A NEW GARMENT
gIhaIooc0nc_1 0 IN THIS CLIP FOR TEACHING HIP-HOP DANCE TO KIDS WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT ILLUSION STYLES
gIhaIooc0nc_2 0 IN ILLUSION STYLES YOU HAVE WAVING AND YOU HAVE GLIDING
gIhaIooc0nc_3 0 THIS STUFF IS REALLY FUN FOR KIDS BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE YOUR BODY IS DOING SOMETHING THAT YOUR BODY IS NOT REALLY DOING

gIhaIooc0nc_13 0 WRIST ELBOW SHOULDER SHOULDER ELBOW WRIST RELEASE
gIhaIooc0nc_14 0 NOW THIS TURNS INTO A WAVE
gIhaIooc0nc_15 0 LET'S TRY A WAVE
gIhaIooc0nc_16 0 FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT
Glpve00xIb8_1 0 IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN PURCHASING A CRUISER OR THAT'S KIND OF YOUR THING WE HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT STYLES OF HELMETS TO CHOOSE FROM AND I JUST KIND OF WANTED TO GO OVER EACH OF THEM REALLY QUICKLY FOR YOU
Glpve00xIb8_2 0 THIS ONE IS A HALF HELMET AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S ONLY HALF OF IT
Glpve00xIb8_3 0 IT IS NOT SNELL APPROVED AND IT ONLY COVERS THE TOP PART OF YOUR HEAD
Glpve00xIb8_4 0 THIS IS A THREE QUARTER HELMET IT ONLY GOES DOWN PARTIALLY AND THE VISOR IS DIFFERENT AND YOU HAVE MORE OPEN AREA IN YOUR FACE
Glpve00xIb8_5 0 THIS IS WHAT'S CALLED A MODULAR HELMET OR A FLIP FACE HELMET AND AS YOU CAN SEE THE WHOLE FRONT OF THE HELMET COMES OFF
Glpve00xIb8_6 0 THIS IS YOUR STANDARD FULL FACE HELMET IT IS SNELL APPROVED IT IS A COMPOSITE BLEND IT HAS A WONDERFUL VENTILATION SYSTEM IT IS VERY LIGHT IN WEIGHT AS YOU CAN SEE IT COVERS THE WHOLE HEAD
Glpve00xIb8_7 0 THESE THREE ARE NOT SNELL APPROVED WHICH MEANS CRASH TEST RATED AND THIS ONE IS SNELL APPROVED SO THAT IS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO CONSIDER WHEN PURCHASING A HELMET
Glpve00xIb8_8 0 THESE ALL DO NOT COVER THE WHOLE CIRCUMFERENCE OF YOUR FACE SO ALWAYS CONSIDER THAT YOU CANNOT PICK WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO HIT YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU FALL
Glpve00xIb8_9 0 BUT BETTER SOME KIND OF PROTECTION THAN NONE
Glpve00xIb8_10 0 MOSTLY WITH CRUISER HELMETS IT'S A COSMETIC THING AND A PERSONAL PREFERENCE THING BUT PLEASE ALWAYS CONSIDER YOUR SAFETY FIRST WHEN PURCHASING A HELMET
gGHQfBSI0kg_1 0 SO NOW THAT WE HAVE THE MICROPHONE HOOKED UP I'LL DISCUSS THE DIFFERENT EFFECTS THAT YOU CAN PUT ONTO THE UKULELE
gGHQfBSI0kg_2 0 NOW I'M GOING TO START HERE WITH AN ON BOARD EFFECT THAT EXISTS IN THIS AMPLIFIER HERE CALLED A REVERB
gGHQfBSI0kg_3 0 AN ON BOARD EFFECT MEANS IT'S BUILT INTO THE PREAMP OF THE AMPLIFIER SO YOU DON'T NEED A PEDAL
gGHQfBSI0kg_4 0 YOU JUST NEED TO PLUG INTO THE AMP HERE
gGHQfBSI0kg_5 0 NOW REVERB GIVES IT KIND OF A DRY SOUND OR RATHER NO REVERB IS A DRY SOUND SO CHECK THIS OUT
gGHQfBSI0kg_6 0 THERE'S NO ECHO THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD CALL DRY
gGHQfBSI0kg_7 0 NOW IF WE PUT REVERB ON HERE YOU'LL NOTICE THERE'S SOME ECHO IT'S ALMOST LIKE PLAYING IN A BIG HALL OR AN EMPTY ROOM
gGHQfBSI0kg_8 0 NOW THIS ALLOWS ME TO ADJUST THE PARAMETERS OF IT
gGHQfBSI0kg_9 0 I CAN HAVE A WHOLE LOT SO IT SOUNDS LIKE A VERY LARGE ROOM OR LESS TO MAKE IT A SMALLER ROOM
gGHQfBSI0kg_10 0 THERE'S ALSO DIFFERENT TYPES OF REVERB ON HERE THAT EMULATE DIFFERENT SIZE ROOMS
gjW60lZ4-xA_1 0 GINA KENNEDY MARICHYASANA IS ANOTHER GREAT SPINAL TWIST WHICH MASSAGES YOUR DIGESTIVE ORGANS AND HELPS WITH ELIMINATION
gjW60lZ4-xA_2 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FAITH HELP DEMONSTRATE THE SPINAL TWIST POSE
gjW60lZ4-xA_4 0 SO SHE'S GOING TO TAKE HER LEFT FOOT AND CROSS IT OVER HER RIGHT KNEE THEN SHE'S GOING TO PRESS HER LEFT BIG TOE MOUND RIGHT DOWN INTO THE EARTH AND PRESS HER LEFT HIP DOWN
gjW60lZ4-xA_5 0 NOW FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GET BOTH HIPS DOWN EVENLY ON THE GROUND AND FOR THAT REASON THEY MIGHT NEED TO EXTEND THIS LEG OUT AND FLEX THROUGH YOUR FOOT AND PULL THE TOES BACK
gjW60lZ4-xA_7 0 SO WHATEVER POSITION EITHER WITH THE LEG EXTENDED SO THAT BOTH HIPS CAN BE DOWN OR WITH THE HEEL BACK TOWARDS YOUR OPPOSITE HIP WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU
gjW60lZ4-xA_9 0 WE'RE GOING TO PLACE THIS BLOCK RIGHT BEHIND FAITH'S SPINE
gjW60lZ4-xA_11 0 SO SHE'S GOING TO INHALE AND LENGTHEN AND AS SHE EXHALES SHE'S GOING TO ROTATE TOWARDS HER KNEE GOOD AND THEN PRESS HER HAND INTO THE BLOCK
gjW60lZ4-xA_13 0 EXTENDING HER TAILBONE RIGHT DOWN INTO THE EARTH AND THEN LENGTHENING UP TO THE CROWN OF THE HEAD INHALING IN AND THEN AS SHE EXHALES SHE ROTATES INTO THAT LENGTH JUST A LITTLE BIT DEEPER
GYCkCk9cPlQ_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS JEFF FIFFIE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'LL BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO PERFORM BASIC FUEL MAINTENANCE ON YOUR CAR
GYCkCk9cPlQ_2 0 THE PURPOSE OF YOUR FUEL FILTER IS TO CLEAN YOUR FUEL BEFORE IT REACHING YOUR ENGINE
GYCkCk9cPlQ_3 0 THERE ARE TWO BASIC TYPES OF FUEL FILTERS
GYCkCk9cPlQ_4 0 THERE ARE IN THE TANK FUEL FILTERS AND THERE ARE IN THE LINE FUEL FILTERS
GYCkCk9cPlQ_5 0 THE IN THE TANK FUEL FILTERS REQUIRES NO MAINTENANCE IT'S SELF CLEANING
GYCkCk9cPlQ_6 0 IT IS MADE UP OF WOVEN PLASTIC AND REQUIRES NO CLEANING OR NO MAINTENANCE
GYCkCk9cPlQ_7 0 THE IN THE LINE FILTERS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE SATURATED WITH CONTAMINANTS
GYCkCk9cPlQ_8 0 ON AN AVERAGE OF 15,000 MILES IT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED
GYCkCk9cPlQ_9 0 THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF IN THE LINE FUEL FILTER
GYCkCk9cPlQ_10 0 AROUND THAT TIME IT BECOMES FILLED WITH CONTAMINANTS AND CAN NO LONGER BE USED TO FILTER THE FUEL
GYCkCk9cPlQ_11 0 A DIRTY FUEL FILTER CAN LOWER YOUR OUTPUT POWER OUTPUT AND CAUSE HESITATION AND HARD STARTING
GYCkCk9cPlQ_12 0 ALSO DIRTY AND CONTAMINANT FUEL CAN EASILY CLOG YOUR INJECTORS AND YOUR FUEL RAIL
g9dv4TRFIxI_1 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE GOTH HAIRSTYLE
g9dv4TRFIxI_2 0 NOW THERE'S A REALLY WIDE RANGE OF HAIRSTYLES THAT EXIST WITHIN GOTH
g9dv4TRFIxI_3 0 SOME PEOPLE GO FOR MOHAWKS SOME PEOPLE GO FOR RINGLETS TO COMPLETE SORT OF THE VICTORIAN DOLL LOOK BUT IN GENERAL THE HAIR IS MESSY
g9dv4TRFIxI_4 0 IT'S NOT PERFECTLY COIFFED AT ALL AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE BIG HAIR
g9dv4TRFIxI_5 0 A LOT OF VOLUME A LOT OF STANDING OUT
g9dv4TRFIxI_6 0 AND IT TO THE POINT WHERE IT SHOULD ALMOST LOOK FAKE
g9dv4TRFIxI_7 0 VERY POPULAR IS FOR IT TO BE KIND OF SORT OF COVERING PEOPLES EYES
g9dv4TRFIxI_8 0 YOU CAN SEE WITH MY BANGS IT'S LONG AND THEY'RE COMING INTO THE EYES
g9dv4TRFIxI_9 0 ANY HAIRSTYLE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO USE A LOT OF PRODUCT
g9dv4TRFIxI_10 0 I WOULD RECOMMEND USING A MOUSSE PUTTING IT INTO THE HAIR WHEN IT'S WET AND TEASING THE HAIR OUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FOR WHATEVER STYLE YOU CHOOSE
g9dv4TRFIxI_11 0 AND YOU NEED TO USE A HAIRSPRAY AFTER THAT IN ORDER TO HOLD IT IN PLACE
g9dv4TRFIxI_12 0 AND THE HAIRSTYLE'S REALLY A CENTERPIECE OF THE GOTH LOOK
g9dv4TRFIxI_13 0 IN ADDITION TO HAIRSTYLE THE HAIR COLOR SHOULD BE VERY VERY DARK
g9dv4TRFIxI_14 0 BLACK IS FAVORED BUT PEOPLE ALSO USE A MANIC PANIC DYE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO HAVE A BRIGHT BLUE STREAK OR A BRIGHT RED STREAK
g9dv4TRFIxI_15 0 AND THOSE COLORS SHOULD CONTRAST AGAINST THE DARK THE SAME WAY THAT THE MAKE-UP FOR GOTH CONTRASTS AGAINST THE LIGHT SKIN
g9dv4TRFIxI_16 0 IN SOME RESPECTS GOTH WHILE KEEPING IT AS A DARK OVERTONE IS REALLY ABOUT CONTRAST BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT COLORS
Gv5roKhJFRU_1 0 THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON A ALTERNATE TURN TO THE RIGHT
Gv5roKhJFRU_2 0 AGAIN IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME BASIC FOOT MOVEMENT IN TERMS OF THE RHYTHM THAT YOUR FEET ARE MOVING IN BUT IT'S GOING TO BE TO THE RIGHT THIS TIME AND WE'RE GOING TO BE PICKING UP OUR RIGHT FOOT AS SOON AS WE PUT IT DOWN ALMOST
Gv5roKhJFRU_3 0 SO WE'LL START WITH THE FEET SAME KIND OF MOVEMENTS LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT
Gv5roKhJFRU_4 0 YOU MIGHT FEEL COMFORTABLE IF YOU CAN SEE MY LEFT FOOT IT'S KIND OF SLIGHTLY PICKING UP THERE ON THE TURN
Gv5roKhJFRU_5 0 AFTER THAT RIGHT FOOT PICKS UP OR IT CAN SWIVEL
Gv5roKhJFRU_6 0 RIGHT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT
Gv5roKhJFRU_7 0 AND AGAIN WE'RE NOT GOING TO USUALLY DO IT SO MANY TIMES IN A ROW BECAUSE YOU WILL GET DIZZY
Gv5roKhJFRU_8 0 SO IF YOU WANT TO STOP AND START THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE TOO
Gv5roKhJFRU_9 0 YOU WOULD PROBABLY IN A SOLO YOU WOULD PROBABLY ONLY BE DOING THIS MAYBE ONE TIME
Gv5roKhJFRU_10 0 SO WE'LL PUT THE ARMS WITH IT AGAIN IT'S THE SAME ARMS
Gv5roKhJFRU_11 0 OR WOMAN IF YOUR SKIRTS ARE GETTING IN THE WAY IF YOU GOT BAGGY SKIRTS LIKE I DO IT'S TOTALLY OKAY TO JUST HOLD ONTO THEM WHILE YOU TURN KIND OF KEEP THEM IN PLACE SO THAT THEY DON'T GET ALL TWISTED AROUND YOUR LEGS
Gv5roKhJFRU_12 0 SO JUST PRACTICE THAT A FEW TIMES
Gv5roKhJFRU_13 0 IT'S NOT QUITE AS COMMON AS THE FIRST TWO BUT IT DOES HAPPEN IT'S A NICE ALTERNATIVE TO THE BASIC TURN ONCE AGAIN
gpNqYWUWWPY_1 0 ALRIGHT IN THIS SCENE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FOUR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF HERBS
gpNqYWUWWPY_2 0 NOW HERE AGAIN WE HAVE THE HOT AND THE WET AND THE DRY AND HERBS ALL FIT INTO THESE CATEGORIES JUST AS YOUR PROBLEMS OR IMBALANCES DO
gpNqYWUWWPY_3 0 WE HAVE BITTERS WHICH ARE WET AND HOT

gpNqYWUWWPY_6 0 AND WE HAVE ASTRINGENTS WHICH ARE COLD AND DRY
gpNqYWUWWPY_7 0 AND WHEN YOU LEARN THAT ALL HERBS WILL FIT INTO ONE OR MORE OF THESE CATEGORIES IT MAKES IT EASIER FOR YOU TO CHOOSE AN HERB FOR YOURSELF
gpNqYWUWWPY_8 0 IF YOU GO BACK AND YOU TAKE YOUR AILMENT SAY YOU HAVE FEVER WHICH IS HOT AND DRY THEN YOU'RE GOING TO WANT AN HERB THAT GOES DIRECTLY ACROSS OR OPPOSITE FROM IT
gpNqYWUWWPY_9 0 YOU WANT SOMETHING WET AND COLD AND THESE ARE THE HERBS THAT DO THAT
gpNqYWUWWPY_10 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH EACH OF THESE HERBS SECTIONS ONE AT A TIME AND DO SOME DEMONSTRATIONS THAT SHOW YOU HOW EACH OF THESE WORK
gW4g_ZrIBj0_1 0 HEY EVERYBODY MY NAME IS MATT AND I'M SPEAKING TO YOU ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gW4g_ZrIBj0_2 0 ALRIGHT ANOTHER COOL THING ABOUT MORPHEUS IS HOW EASY IT IS TO DOWNLOAD POD CAST THROUGH IT

gW4g_ZrIBj0_13 0 ANOTHER COOL THING ABOUT MORPHEUS THAT IT LET'S YOU CREATE YOUR OWN POD CAST VERY EASILY BUT THAT IS GOING TO BE ON THE OF THIS TUTORIAL I WOULD LET YOU FIGURE THAT OUT FOR YOUR SELF IF YOU ARE INTERESTED
gdNA1ppz2Wc_1 0 HI CHRISSY LYONS WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
gdNA1ppz2Wc_2 0 HERE WE ARE IN THE NEXT SEGMENT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH THE INGREDIENTS
gdNA1ppz2Wc_3 0 FIRST AND FOREMOST YOU GOT TO GET EVERYTHING GOING
gdNA1ppz2Wc_4 0 I USUALLY START WITH CLEANING UP THE CHICKEN
gdNA1ppz2Wc_5 0 IN THE SOUP I USUALLY USE A STOCKPOT WHICH I'VE GOT ON THE STOVE ALREADY
gdNA1ppz2Wc_6 0 GETTING THE WATER HEATED UP A LITTLE BIT
gdNA1ppz2Wc_7 0 AND I FIGURE THREE CHICKEN BREASTS WILL DO IF YOU USE ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE POT FULL
gdNA1ppz2Wc_8 0 WHEN I'M CLEANING THE CHICKEN I USUALLY HAVE THE WATER RUNNING A LITTLE BIT AND RUN IT UNDER THE WATER
gdNA1ppz2Wc_9 0 AND I TRY TO GET ANY EXCESS BITS ON THE INSIDES OF THE BONES
gdNA1ppz2Wc_10 0 WHEN YOU'RE MAKING THE SOUP I USUALLY USE BONELESS NO SKINLESS BUT WITH BONES
gdNA1ppz2Wc_11 0 YOU WANT THE BONES IN THE CHICKEN BREAST BECAUSE IT GIVES THE CHICKEN MORE FLAVOR
gdNA1ppz2Wc_12 0 YET YOU DON'T WANT THE EXCESS SKIN BECAUSE ALL IT DOES IS ADD EXTRA FAT AND GREASE AND WILL REQUIRE MORE SKIMMING
gdNA1ppz2Wc_13 0 WHICH WE'LL GET TO IN A LITTLE BIT
gdNA1ppz2Wc_14 0 HERE'S A TRICK THAT I DO AROUND THE KITCHEN AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU DO BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
gdNA1ppz2Wc_15 0 IF YOU HAVE SCISSORS THAT YOU USE IN THE KITCHEN KEEP THEM JUST FOR YOUR FOOD AND IT MAKES LIFE SO MUCH EASIER TO SNIP OFF ANY LITTLE BITS
gdNA1ppz2Wc_16 0 THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD PIECE
gdNA1ppz2Wc_17 0 DOESN'T REQUIRE TOO MUCH TRIMMING
gdNA1ppz2Wc_18 0 I'LL GET JUST RID OF SOME OF THESE TENDONS AND LITTLE BITS OF EXCESS AND SET IT BACK ON THE CUTTING BOARD
gdNA1ppz2Wc_19 0 AND GET THE NEXT ONE
gdNA1ppz2Wc_20 0 SEE THESE ARE PRETTY GOOD
gdNA1ppz2Wc_21 0 SEE THE BONES IN THERE
gdNA1ppz2Wc_22 0 THERE'S THE MAIN BREAST BONE
gdNA1ppz2Wc_23 0 THEY'RE REALLY PRETTY GOOD
gdNA1ppz2Wc_24 0 DON'T NEED TOO MUCH
gdNA1ppz2Wc_25 0 AND YOUR LITTLE BITS OF LIKE THIS LITTLE BONE JUST PULL THAT OFF CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT THAT GOING INTO THE SOUP
gdNA1ppz2Wc_26 0 THEY'RE REALLY IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE
gdNA1ppz2Wc_27 0 THERE'S THE SECOND ONE
gdNA1ppz2Wc_28 0 PUT THAT OVER THERE
gdNA1ppz2Wc_29 0 NOW THIS ONE'S GOT A LITTLE BIT MORE
gdNA1ppz2Wc_30 0 SEE HOW YOU JUST TAKE THE SCISSORS ALONG
gdNA1ppz2Wc_31 0 AND IF YOU GET SOME OF THE SKIN DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT OR THE MEAT
gdNA1ppz2Wc_32 0 YOU'RE JUST GETTING RID OF THAT EXCESS FAT CAUSE YOU REALLY DON'T NEED IT
gdNA1ppz2Wc_33 0 AND IT MAKES THE SOUP CLEAR
gdNA1ppz2Wc_34 0 AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE TREND TODAY
gdNA1ppz2Wc_37 0 SO THERE WE'VE GOT THE THREE BREASTS READY TO GO
gdNA1ppz2Wc_38 0 ALWAYS REMEMBER TOO WHEN YOU'RE COOKING WITH CHICKEN AS YOU KNOW SALMONELLA SEEMS TO BE A MAIN CONCERN
gdNA1ppz2Wc_39 0 SO YOU'RE ALWAYS WANTING TO WASH YOUR HANDS AND KEEP THINGS CLEAN
gdNA1ppz2Wc_40 0 NEXT THING I'M GOING TO DO IS PUT THE CHICKEN IN A COLANDER AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT SOME BOILING WATER OVER THAT
gdNA1ppz2Wc_41 0 WE'LL KEEP GOING WITH THE CLEANING OF THE REST OF THE VEGETABLES AND WHATNOT
gdNA1ppz2Wc_42 0 SEE YOU IN A MINUTE
G-khg0WPi8E_1 0 THIS IS A SPECIAL
G-khg0WPi8E_2 0 YOU CALL IT BACON-CHEDDAR BAGEL WHERE WE PUT CHEDDAR BACON ON TOP AND CRUSHED BACON INSIDE AND CRUSHED CHEDDAR INSIDE
G-khg0WPi8E_3 0 WE HAVE AN ONION BAGEL HERE
G-khg0WPi8E_4 0 WE HAVE A PLAIN BAGEL HERE
G-khg0WPi8E_5 0 WE MAKE BLUEBERRY
G-khg0WPi8E_6 0 WE CAN MAKE PRETTY MUCH ANY KIND OF BAGEL YOU WANT
G-khg0WPi8E_7 0 NOW YOU GOT TO BEAR IN MIND WHAT BAGELS WERE
G-khg0WPi8E_8 0 BAGELS USED TO BE THE FOOD THAT PEOPLE CARRIED WITH THEM IN LONG DISTANCES
G-khg0WPi8E_9 0 THEREFORE THE METHOD OF BAKING IT WAS THAT YOU WOULD MIX THE DOUGH LIKE A REGULAR BREAD DOUGH THEN IT WOULD LET IT PARTIALLY RISE
G-khg0WPi8E_10 0 AS IT PARTIALLY ROSE YOU WOULD THROW IT IN A BIG BUCKET OF BOILING WATER TO KILL THE YEAST SO IT'LL STOP RISING
G-khg0WPi8E_11 0 THEREFORE IT WILL KIND OF SLOW DOWN ITS FERMENTATION AND THEN YOU WOULD BAKE IT AT THAT STAGE
G-khg0WPi8E_12 0 THEREFORE BAGELS USED TO BE HEAVY DOUGH AND THAT WAS IT WAS BOILED PARTIALLY BECAUSE YOU WANTED THAT BREAD TO LAST FOR LONG TIME
G-khg0WPi8E_13 0 IT DOESN'T GO BAD ON YOU
G-khg0WPi8E_14 0 WELL NOWADAYS WE CREATE WHAT WE CALL A NO-BOIL BAGEL CALIFORNIA STYLE
G-khg0WPi8E_15 0 WHICH OUR BAGELS ARE VERY SOFT
G-khg0WPi8E_16 0 WE SEE NO NEED FOR THAT HARD-BOILED BREAD ANY LONGER BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS BAGEL AND JOURNEY A THOUSAND MILES THROUGH THE DESERT OR THROUGH THE WILDERNESS AND WE WANT IT TO REMAIN NICE AND EDIBLE
G-khg0WPi8E_17 0 SO WE CREATED A SOFT BAGEL
G-khg0WPi8E_18 0 WE TAKE THE WE DON'T USE THE HIGH GLUTEN FOR IT WE USE THE BREAD FLOUR FOR IT
G-khg0WPi8E_19 0 AND YOU COULD THROW ANYTHING YOU WANT IN THERE
G-khg0WPi8E_20 0 YOU COULD THROW BACON AS WE DID HERE
G-khg0WPi8E_21 0 YOU COULD DO DRIED ONIONS
G-khg0WPi8E_22 0 YOU COULD DO CRUSHED BLUEBERRIES
G-khg0WPi8E_23 0 YOU COULD PRETTY MUCH DO ANYTHING
G-khg0WPi8E_24 0 YOU COULD TAKE THIS AND ADD FIFTY %PERCENT WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR TO IT AND HAVE A REALLY NICE WHOLE WHEAT BAGEL WITH WALNUTS OR RAISINS IN IT
G-khg0WPi8E_25 0 AND ADD A LITTLE HONEY TO GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE TASTE
G-khg0WPi8E_26 0 AND OF COURSE HONEY DOES WONDERS FOR THE BREAD BECAUSE HONEY IS CALLED INVERT SUGAR
G-khg0WPi8E_27 0 IT RETAINS MOISTURE
G-khg0WPi8E_28 0 SO IF YOU THROW HONEY IN IT IT ACTS AS A PRESERVATIVE AND MAKES IT LAST MUCH LONGER AND KEEPS IT EXTREMELY MOIST
guxhBx7T9DQ_1 0 I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT YU-GI-OH TODAY AND THIS IS DIFFERENT DIMENSION WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
guxhBx7T9DQ_2 0 WE'LL START OFF WITH SKILL DRAIN
guxhBx7T9DQ_3 0 SKILL DRAIN IS A TRAP CARD THAT WHEN ACTIVATED NEGATES THE EFFECTS OF ALL EFFECT MONSTERS
guxhBx7T9DQ_4 0 LAYMAN'S TERMS THIS MEANS THAT YOUR EFFECT MONSTERS WHO RUN YOUR DIFFERENT DIMENSION DECK ARE INEFFECTIVE -THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING THEY JUST KIND OF STALL
guxhBx7T9DQ_5 0 WITH THIS THING ON FIELD YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO PLAY MUCH AND WHATEVER IS ON THE FIELD YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE
guxhBx7T9DQ_6 0 ANYTHING THAT REMOVES MONSTERS LIKE KIKO OR BANSHER THEIR EFFECTS NO LONGER APPLY
guxhBx7T9DQ_7 0 THINGS LIKE HELIOS -NO LONGER EFFECTIVE
guxhBx7T9DQ_8 0 HE'S A ZERO ZERO MONSTER THAT WILL TOTALLY GET WASTED
guxhBx7T9DQ_9 0 YOU CAN BYPASS THIS BY OF COURSE BY RUNNING A DIMENSION FISSURE OR MACRO COSMOS BUT YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THOSE OUT AND EVEN THEN YOUR MONSTERS LIKE D.D
guxhBx7T9DQ_10 0 SURVIVOR WHO COME BACK WHEN REMOVED FROM PLAY NO LONGER WORK
guxhBx7T9DQ_11 0 WE ALSO HAVE PHOENIX WING WIND BLAST
guxhBx7T9DQ_12 0 A PROPER TIMING OF PHOENIX WING WIND BLAST WILL PUT ONE OF YOUR KEY COMPONENTS BACK TO THE TOP OF YOUR DECK
guxhBx7T9DQ_13 0 IF YOU ONLY HAVE DIMENSION FISSURE OUT AND YOU'RE RELYING ON THAT TO KEEP THINGS REMOVED HE RETURNS IT TO THE TOP OF YOUR DECK AND CONTINUES HIS PLAY
guxhBx7T9DQ_14 0 THIS NOT ONLY SETS YOU BACK A TURN BECAUSE YOU'RE DRAWING INTO YOUR DIFFERENT DIMENSIONAL FISSURE BUT NOW YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE
guxhBx7T9DQ_15 0 SO IF YOU HAD NO CARDS IN HAND YOU'RE JUST DRAWING DIMENSION FISSURE AND REPLAYING IT AND HE COULD POSSIBLY DO THE SAME THING
guxhBx7T9DQ_16 0 WE THEN HAVE RAIZA RECENTLY LIMITED TO ONE IN MOST DECKS BECAUSE OF HIS STRENGTH
guxhBx7T9DQ_17 0 HE LIKE PHOENIX WING WIND BLAST IS A MOD RETURNS ONE CARD TO THE TOP OF AN OPPONENT'S DECK
guxhBx7T9DQ_18 0 THEY DECIDED THAT HAVING THREE OF THESE GUYS AND POSSIBLY THREE PHOENIX WING WIND BLASTS WAS TOO GOOD SO THEY LIMITED IT TO ONE
guxhBx7T9DQ_19 0 HE SEES PLAY IN MOST MONARCH DECKS AND HE'S OCCASIONALLY THE ONE OF AS A SURPRISE IN OTHER DECKS
guxhBx7T9DQ_20 0 HE RETURNS ANY PIECE TO THE TOP OF YOUR DECK AND THEN HITS YOU
gebHimd0myU_1 0 I'M TRAVIS STEGLICH WITH STEGLICH FARM SUPPLY AND I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gebHimd0myU_2 0 WE ARE GROWING ACORNS INTO OAK TREES
gebHimd0myU_3 0 ALL WE ARE GOING TO DO NOW IS WATER THE ONES THAT WE HAVE PUT INTO THE SOIL HALF WAY IN AND HALF WAY OUT THE WAY THAT MOTHER NATURE WOULD PLANT
gebHimd0myU_4 0 I AM ALSO WATERING MY LITTLE ALLIGATOR JAW PLANT THAT WAS THERE
gebHimd0myU_5 0 BUT WE HAVE THE LIVE OAKS THE SPANISH OAKS AND THE BURR OAKS THE ONES THAT SANK THE ONES THAT FLOATED AND WE ARE GOING TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT SINKING ACORNS GUARANTEES A 100 PERCENT GERMINATION

g-Y3Vf-FZHg_2 0 MAYBE I LIKE TO SAY JUST ABOUT SOMETHING VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SINGLE MALT WHISKEY AND A BLENDED WHISKEY
g-Y3Vf-FZHg_3 0 BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S OFTEN CONFUSES PEOPLE AND INDEED PEOPLE OFTEN CONSIDER A BLENDED WHISKEY TO BE INFERIOR TO A SINGLE MALT WHISKEY
g-Y3Vf-FZHg_4 0 AND OF COURSE LIKE SOMETIMES BE THE CASE DEPENDING ON THE BLEND AT SELF THE DISTINCT DIFFERENCE BEING OF COURSE A SINGLE MALT IS BLENDED FROM ONE SOURCE OF BARLEY AND A BLENDED WHISKEY ARE COMING FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MALT WHISKEYS THEMSELVES
g-Y3Vf-FZHg_5 0 INDEED THE FAMOUS GROUSE AS A BLEND BETWEEN THE VERY FAMOUS MACALLEN ARRANGE OF WHISKEYS AND HIGHLAND PARK AND THEREFORE A BLENDED WHISKEY HAS TO BE CONSIDERED TO BE A VERY SUPERIOR BLENDED WHISKEY
g-Y3Vf-FZHg_6 0 THE FAMOUS GROUSE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A SUPERIOR BLENDED WHISKEY IT COMES FROM THE GREAT WHISKEYS MACALLEN FROM THE HIGHLAND REGION AND ALSO THE HIGHLAND PARK THE WHISKEY FROM THE ISLES THESE ARE TWO SUPERIOR SINGLE MALT WHISKEYS THAT HELP MAKE UP THE FAMOUS GROUSE SCOTLAND'S MOST FAMOUS BLENDED WHISKEY

gUNEuATFk_Q_13 0 EXHALE ON THE WAY OUT
gUNEuATFk_Q_14 0 EIGHT NINE TEN

GlzGBHkMXWI_1 0 MY NAME IS RICHARD GOMS WE'RE IN MURRAY UTAH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BASIC CAR CARE
GlzGBHkMXWI_2 0 I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW ROTORS WORK ON A CAR
GlzGBHkMXWI_3 0 ROTORS USUALLY APPEAR ON THE FRONT OF A CAR AND ARE USED FOR BRAKING
GlzGBHkMXWI_4 0 NEWER CARS DO HAVE ROTORS IN THE BACK
GlzGBHkMXWI_5 0 THE ROTOR APPEARS ON THE WHEEL AND IT TURNS AS YOU'RE GOING DOWN THE ROAD THEN WHEN YOU PRESS ON THE BRAKES HYDRAULIC FLUID IS PUSHED THROUGH THIS LINE INTO THE CALIPER
GlzGBHkMXWI_6 0 THE CALIPER THEN PUTS PRESSURE ON BRAKES PADS SUCH AS THIS THIS IS A BRAKE PAD AND THAT PRESSURE THEN PUSHES ON THE ROTOR AND APPLIES STOPPING POWER TO THAT ROTOR
GlzGBHkMXWI_7 0 ON MANY OF THE BRAKE PADS THERE'S USUALLY A LITTLE FEELER GAGE AND THAT FEELER GAGE WHEN THE BRAKES GET TOO LOW WILL START DRAGGING ON THE ROTOR AND WHEN YOU HEAR THAT LITTLE NOISE AND IT STARTS WHEN YOU START BACKING UP IT'LL MAKE A NOISE AND WHEN YOU START HEARING THAT NOISE YOU'LL KNOW THAT THE BRAKES NEED TO BE REPLACED
h5XbO0N36WU_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET WITH A COMPLETE PACKAGE WHEN YOU PURCHASE A KITE
h5XbO0N36WU_2 0 THERE'S A SERIOUS ADVANTAGE TO BUYING A KITE FROM A PROPER RETAILER
h5XbO0N36WU_3 0 YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GETTING A YOU KNOW A BRAND NEW KITE THAT'S GOT A WARRANTY AND IT'S TOTALLY GOOD UP TO WORKING SPEED AND ORDER
h5XbO0N36WU_4 0 AND YOU'RE GETTING IT WITH ALL THE ESSENTIALS AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU'LL NEED FOR THAT KITE SUCH AS A PUMP A BAR LINES AND THE ACTUAL KITE ITSELF WITH BRIDLES IF IT HAS THEM DEPENDING ON THE STYLE
h5XbO0N36WU_5 0 OLDER KITES ARE GOOD DEFINITELY GOOD TO LEARN ON
h5XbO0N36WU_6 0 BUT YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE GETTING A QUALITY PRODUCT
h5XbO0N36WU_7 0 THIS KITE HAS YOUR LIFE IN ITS HANDS
h5XbO0N36WU_8 0 SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE SOMETHING SOLID YOU KNOW YOU COULD DEFINITELY FIND YOURSELF IN A KITEMARE SITUATION
h5XbO0N36WU_9 0 SO KITEMARE NIGHTMARES DO THE MATH IT'S PRETTY SELF-EXPLANATORY
h5XbO0N36WU_10 0 IF YOU HAVE KITE OR A PUMP RIGHT HERE SOMETIMES IT'LL COME WITH A PRESSURE GAUGE
h5XbO0N36WU_11 0 YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE IN A SALTY SANDY SCENARIO WHEN YOU'RE USING THIS KITE OR THIS PUMP SO THE GAUGE IF PROBABLY ONLY GOING TO WORK FOR THE FIRST DOZEN TIMES YOU TAKE THAT KITE OUT
h5XbO0N36WU_12 0 SO YOU WANT TO GET A GOOD SOLID FEEL ON HOW MUCH PRESSURE YOU WANT TO PUT INTO THAT KITE
h5XbO0N36WU_13 0 A FIRMER KITE IS ALWAYS BETTER
h5XbO0N36WU_14 0 YOU KNOW YOU WANT A RIGID STRUCTURE TO THE PROFILE OF THAT KITE SO IT FLIES APPROPRIATELY
h5XbO0N36WU_15 0 IF YOU DON'T PUT ENOUGH AIR INTO IT YOU KNOW YOUR KITE IS GOING TO FLY ERRATICALLY AND NOT THE WAY YOU WANT
h5XbO0N36WU_16 0 IF YOU FIND A PUMP THAT YOU KNOW HAS GOTTEN TOO MUCH SAND IN IT OR BASICALLY DOESN'T WORK THE SAME WAY IT WAS ANY SORT OF GENERAL LUBRICANT BASICALLY JUST COAT THE ENTIRE SHAFT
h5XbO0N36WU_17 0 AND YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF TIMES JUST WORKING IT IN AND OUT AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'VE GOT A PERFECT KITE PERFECT PUMP BACK TO BRAND NEW
h5XbO0N36WU_18 0 SO EVERY TIME YOU ARE USING YOUR GEAR GENERAL MAINTENANCE YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY AN EVERY TIME NECESSITY
h5XbO0N36WU_19 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE ALL OF YOUR STUFF IS POSITIVELY PROPER WORKING AND YOU KNOW JUST AS GOOD AS NEW
h5XbO0N36WU_20 0 SO THAT'S THAT
G_Cg1ldU2kg_1 0 THE NEXT AREA THAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS TRYING TO KEEP YOUR SHOULDERS ABOVE YOUR KNEES
G_Cg1ldU2kg_2 0 THE BASIC STANCE IN BOXING AS CHAD WILL DEMONSTRATE HERE IS TO ACTUALLY HAVE YOUR HEELS SHOULDER WIDTH APART
G_Cg1ldU2kg_3 0 AND FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT OF COURSE IS GOING TO VARY
G_Cg1ldU2kg_4 0 CHAD HAS GOT ABOUT AN EIGHTEEN INCH SHOULDER WIDTH SO HIS HEELS SHOULD BE ABOUT EIGHTEEN INCHES APART AND TWENTY-FOUR INCHES BETWEEN THERE SOMEWHERE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_5 0 NOW AS HE'S ADVANCING HE WANTS TO KEEP HIS SHOULDER JUST ABOVE THE KNEE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_6 0 THAT'S THE PROPER WAY OF DOING IT
G_Cg1ldU2kg_7 0 AND VICE VERSA
G_Cg1ldU2kg_8 0 GOING BACKWARDS WE DON'T WANT TO LEAN TOO FAR BACK
G_Cg1ldU2kg_9 0 WE WANT TO STILL KEEP THE SHOULDER ABOVE THE KNEE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_10 0 NOW SHOWING THE WRONG WAY IS IF HE MOVES HIS SHOULDER PAST HIS KNEE HE'S YOU CAN SEE HE'S WAY OUTSTRETCHED OKAY AND THAT PUTS THAT BACK FOOT UP OFF THE GROUND
G_Cg1ldU2kg_11 0 WHAT THAT'S GOING TO DO IS IT'S GOING TO HELP HIM TO TOPPLE OVER POSSIBLY
G_Cg1ldU2kg_12 0 SO HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HEEL GOES WITH THE SHOULDER
G_Cg1ldU2kg_13 0 KEEP THE SHOULDER ABOVE THE KNEES BASICALLY
G_Cg1ldU2kg_14 0 AND YOUR HEEL IS GOING TO BE BELOW YOUR KNEE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_15 0 SO ONCE YOU'VE GOT YOUR SHOULDER ABOVE YOUR KNEE THEN YOU SHOULD BE FINE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_16 0 ALSO GOING BACKWARDS YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_17 0 IF HIS SHOULDER IS PASSED HIS KNEE IN THE BACK HE'S TOO FAR BACK AND THAT'S ALSO A DANGEROUS SITUATION
G_Cg1ldU2kg_18 0 IF WE'RE MOVING TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT WE SHOULD ALSO TRY TO KEEP THAT SHOULDER ABOVE THE KNEE AT ALL TIMES SO THAT WE'RE NOT LEANING TOO FAR OFF TO ONE SIDE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_19 0 ONCE YOU START LEANING TOO FAR FORWARD TOO FAR BACK OR TOO FAR TO ONE SIDE YOU'RE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO GETTING KNOCKED OVER WHEN YOU DO GET PUNCHED
G_Cg1ldU2kg_20 0 SHOULDERS ABOVE KNEES

GusDlU89Zbo_2 0 SO WITH A BICEP CURL YOUR GOAL IS TO WORK THE TWO-HEADED MUSCLE IN THE FRONT PART OF THE ARM
GusDlU89Zbo_3 0 YOU WANT TO START WITH YOUR FEET SHOULDER WIDTH HIP WIDTH APART YOU WANT YOUR ELBOWS IN TO THE SIDE WITH A NICE NEUTRAL WRIST CHOOSING A WEIGHT THAT'S GOING TO FATIGUE THAT MUSCLE IN TEN FIFTEEN REPS THREE SETS

gs6EQ0LKx_w_8 0 THIS MEANS ANY KIND OF DIRT WHICH IS ON YOUR EQUIPMENT
gs6EQ0LKx_w_9 0 SANITIZATION ON THE OTHER HAND IS TRYING TO KILL THE MICROBES THAT EXIST ON YOUR EQUIPMENT
gs6EQ0LKx_w_10 0 THIS REQUIRES A FURTHER LEVEL OF CLEANLINESS AS IT GOES BEYOND CLEANING AND INTO THE KILLING STAGE
gs6EQ0LKx_w_11 0 STERILIZATION IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR BREWING AS THIS INVOLVES KILLING EVERY MICROBE WHICH IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BUT IF YOU MAINTAIN A SANITARY ENVIRONMENT THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BEST THING THING THAT YOU COULD DO FOR YOUR BEER

-Hbfy0dOoos_6 0 VERY IMPORTANT THAT WAY PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING AT IT ON A WEBSITE OR IN A CATALOG CAN GET A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE ON THEM
-Hbfy0dOoos_7 0 SO THE KEY TO THAT IS YOU'RE MAKING SURE THE BOTTOM AREA IS GOING TO HANG OR DRAPE THE WAY IT PROBABLY WOULD WHEN A PERSON IS WEARING IT
-Hbfy0dOoos_8 0 YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO STYLE IT IN THAT MANNER
-Hbfy0dOoos_9 0 ALSO WITH THIS PIECE OF JEWELRY IN PARTICULAR YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PENDANTS ON IT SO THERE'S MORE OF AN AREA THAT YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON WITH YOUR CAMERA THEN JUST SAY IF THERE WAS ONE PENDANT OR IF THEY WERE ALL SORT OF BUNCHED TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF THE NECKLACE ITSELF
-Hbfy0dOoos_10 0 WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS JUST KIND OF STRETCH IT OUT HERE A LITTLE BIT AND THEN JUST FORM A LITTLE BIT OF A ALMOST A HEART SHAPE

-Hbfy0dOoos_12 0 SOMETIMES IF THE JEWELRY ITSELF IS VERY COMPLEX OR THE PIECES ARE TOUGH TO DISTINGUISH YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET IT SET UP EXACTLY RIGHT
-Hbfy0dOoos_13 0 SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A STYLIST OR EVEN THE DESIGNER THERE TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE SHOWING THE JEWELRY THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE WORN

gKqjbqwlZAc_2 0 IN ORDER TO REALLY FOR THE OPTIMUM STYLE OF PLAYING IS TO KEEP YOUR BODY ERECT LIKE THIS WHERE YOU'RE SIMPLY STRAIGHTFORWARD YOU'RE NOT SLOUCHING BECAUSE WHEN YOU SLOUCH YOU INHIBIT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO PLAY THE INSTRUMENT AS OPPOSED IF YOU'RE STANDING YOU CAN MANIPULATE YOUR INSTRUMENT MUCH BETTER

gKqjbqwlZAc_6 0 YOU DON'T WANT YOUR HANDS FLAT YOU WANT THEM ARCHED OVER WHETHER YOU'RE PLAYING A SCALE OR IF YOU'RE PLAYING A CHORD YOU WANT A CERTAIN LITTLE ARCH AND WITH YOUR PICKING HAND YOU SIMPLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO STRUM DOWN OR IF YOU'RE PICKING YOU WANT YOUR HAND VERY RELAXED YOUR ARM RESTED OVER LIKE OVER THIS OR EVEN IF THERE'S NOT A CONTOUR HERE EVEN IF IT'S A STRAIGHT YOU WANT YOUR HAND REACHING OVER THAT WHERE YOUR ATTACK IS OVER THE PICKUPS
gKqjbqwlZAc_7 0 THAT WAY YOU CAN RELAX AND THUS PLAY YOUR INSTRUMENT MUCH EASIER

G5drYWg1u1M_6 0 IF YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR INJURY IT'S ADVISABLE THAT YOU DEFINITELY FOLLOW THE PLAN THAT YOUR DOCTOR HAS OR YOUR PHYSICAL THERAPIST HAS
G5drYWg1u1M_7 0 REMEMBER YOUR DOCTOR ALWAYS SUPERSEDES EVERYTHING ELSE
G5drYWg1u1M_8 0 AND WHILE DOING THESE EXERCISES YOU DO HAPPEN TO FEEL PAIN JUST MAKE SURE YOU STOP
G5drYWg1u1M_9 0 ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOUR BODY AND WHENEVER YOUR BODY IS TALKING TO YOU WHETHER IT IS TELLING YOU PAIN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ALWAYS REMEMBER TO FOLLOW WHAT YOUR BODY SAYS
G5drYWg1u1M_10 0 SO WITH THAT BEING SAID STAY TUNED AND I'LL SHOW YOU ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXERCISES THAT ARE GOING TO STRENGTHEN YOUR ENTIRE BODY AND SUPPORT THE MUSCLES AROUND YOUR KNEE
GSFBHm2CAqc_1 0 HI I'M THE STAR GODDESS AND HERE'S A TIP FOR ENDING A RELATIONSHIP WITH A SCORPIO
GSFBHm2CAqc_2 0 THE TRUTH BE TOLD BE TOLD THE ONLY WAY REALLY TO END A RELATIONSHIP WITH A SCORPIO IS TO DIE BECAUSE SCORPIO TRULY FEELS THE PHRASE THAT IF YOU LOVE SOMETHING SET IT FREE
GSFBHm2CAqc_3 0 IF IT COMES BACK IT WAS MEANT TO BE
GSFBHm2CAqc_4 0 IF IT DOESN'T TRACK IT DOWN AND KILL IT DEAD
GSFBHm2CAqc_5 0 WHEN A SCORPIO SAYS I LOVE YOU THEY MEAN FOR THIS LIFETIME THE ONE AFTER THAT AND THE ONE AFTER THAT
GSFBHm2CAqc_6 0 SCORPIO HAS LITTLE OR NO ABILITY TO DETACH FROM SOMETHING THAT IT'S ATTRACTED TO
GSFBHm2CAqc_7 0 SO IF YOU TRULY WANT TO GET RID OF A SCORPIO THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO MANIFEST BEHAVIOR THAT THEY DON'T LIKE SO THE SCORPIO CHOOSES TO NOT WANT YOU ANYMORE
GSFBHm2CAqc_8 0 THE BEST THING TO DO TO GET RID OF A SCORPIO IS TO HAVE SEX WITH HER BEST FRIEND AND THEN THEY'LL BE DONE FOREVER
GSFBHm2CAqc_9 0 BUT EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY BE GONE IT DOES NOT RECLUDE THEM FROM SHOWING UP ON YOUR DOORSTEP AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING SKULKING AROUND YOUR BUSHES TO SEE IF YOU ARE STILL WITH THAT GUY
GSFBHm2CAqc_10 0 AND EVEN IF YOU ARE MARRIED TO THE SCORPIO AND THEY DIE THEIR FEELING IS JUST CAUSE I'M DEAD DOESN'T MEAN I'M NOT STILL MARRIED TO YOU
GSFBHm2CAqc_11 0 THAT'S HOW YOU END A RELATIONSHIP WITH A SCORPIO
GSFBHm2CAqc_12 0 I'M JANET SCIALES THE STAR GODDESS AND THAT'S BETTER LIVING THROUGH ASTROLOGY
gS8GzCQVGH8_1 0 YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT IN TIME ALL OF US ARE GOING TO INCUR SOME TYPE OF MEDICAL PROBLEM OR MINOR INJURY
gS8GzCQVGH8_2 0 I AM CAPTAIN JOE BRUNI
gS8GzCQVGH8_3 0 AND WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS HOW TO TREAT A STUBBED TOE
gS8GzCQVGH8_4 0 STUBBED TOE CAN BE A PRETTY PAINFUL EXPERIENCE
gS8GzCQVGH8_5 0 THE FIRST STEP IS TO EVALUATE TO SEE IF THERE'S ACTUALLY BEEN A WOUND CREATED AFTER THE TOE HAS BEEN DAMAGED OR STUBBED
gS8GzCQVGH8_6 0 IF THERE'S BEEN A WOUND CLEAN THE WOUND OUT TO REMOVE ANY DIRT OR DEBRIS THAT MAY HAVE GOTTEN INTO THE WOUND TO PREVENT SECONDARY FORMS OF INFECTION FROM OCCURRING
gS8GzCQVGH8_7 0 SOME TYPE OF SOAP AND WATER OR ANTISEPTIC SOLUTION FOR FIRST AID CAN BE USED TO CLEAN THE WOUND AREA
gS8GzCQVGH8_8 0 THEN ICE CAN BE APPLIED TO REDUCE SWELLING AND PAIN
gS8GzCQVGH8_9 0 ICE SHOULD BE APPLIED IN TWENTY MINUTE INCREMENTS OF TWENTY MINUTES ON AND TWENTY MINUTES OFF TO AVOID HAVING SOME TYPE OF COLD INJURY FROM THE ICE PACK ITSELF OCCUR
gS8GzCQVGH8_10 0 AFTER THE APPLICATION OF ICE THE TOW COULD BE SPLINTED OR TAPED TO THE TOE NEXT TO IT TO REDUCE MOBILITY AND KEEP THAT TOE FROM FLEXING OR BENDING
gS8GzCQVGH8_11 0 OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS REST AND AVOID USING THAT TOE UNTIL THE HEALING PROCESS TAKES PLACE AND HAS OCCURRED
gS8GzCQVGH8_12 0 I'M CAPTAIN JOE BRUNI
gS8GzCQVGH8_13 0 STAY SAFE AND WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME

GXg0Ea2z130_1 0 NOW WE'RE MOVING ONTO BRONZER
GXg0Ea2z130_2 0 CARMEN ELECTRA IS ALWAYS NICE AND TAN AND BRONZE
GXg0Ea2z130_3 0 IF YOU'RE NOT NATURALLY THAT WAY YOU WANT TO USE A LITTLE BRONZER
GXg0Ea2z130_4 0 I LOVE THIS BRUSH
GXg0Ea2z130_5 0 IF YOU WATCH ANY OF MY VIDEOS YOU WILL BE SEEING ME WITH THIS BRUSH
GXg0Ea2z130_6 0 IT'S GREAT FOR BLUSH BRONZER POWDER
GXg0Ea2z130_7 0 IT'S JUST A GREAT MAC BRUSH
GXg0Ea2z130_8 0 IT'S NATURAL HAIR
GXg0Ea2z130_10 0 IT'S KIND OF EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH IT BECAUSE IT'LL LAST YOU FOREVER
GXg0Ea2z130_11 0 I'M USING A NICE KIND OF SHIMMERY NEUTRAL BRONZER
GXg0Ea2z130_12 0 I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS ON THE FACE WHERE THE SUN WILL NATURALLY HIT
GXg0Ea2z130_13 0 THE BRIDGES OF THE NOSE THE FOREHEAD THE CHIN AND THEN THE CHEEKBONES
GXg0Ea2z130_14 0 THAT'S WHERE YOUR BRONZER SHOULD GO
GXg0Ea2z130_15 0 YOU CAN BE A LITTLE HEAVY HANDED WITH THE BRONZER BECAUSE YOU REALLY DO WANT TO LOOK SUN KISSED AND YOU WANT TO LOOK LIKE YOU SOME MAKEUP ON
GXg0Ea2z130_16 0 YOU CAN'T AVOID IT WHEN YOU'RE USING ALL THIS MAKEUP
GXg0Ea2z130_17 0 YOU WANT TO JUST BUFF IT INTO THE SKIN
GXg0Ea2z130_18 0 JUST USE A LITTLE AT A TIME UNTIL YOU GET YOUR DESIRED LOOK
GXg0Ea2z130_19 0 LIZZIE'S A LITTLE MORE PALE SKINNED SO I'M JUST GOING TO KIND OF PILE IT ON AND TAKE IT DOWN THE NECK AND THE CHEST

GXg0Ea2z130_21 0 JUST GIVES A NICE HEALTHY GLOW TO THE SKIN
gJGhRrSaPlQ_1 0 SO IN ORDER TO BID BEYOND THE SIXTY LEVEL YOU NEED TO HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF MELD TO SUPPORT YOU BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU STOPPED AT SIXTY AND YOU ONLY HAD TWENTY MELD YOU HAVE TO TAKE FORTY COUNTERS SO THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP AND HERE'S A SCORE SHEET AND I'LL JUST SHOW YOU WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
gJGhRrSaPlQ_2 0 IF YOUR SIDE HAS BID SIXTY RIGHT AND YOU HAVE THIRTY-FIVE MELD YOU NEED TWENTY-FIVE COUNTERS TO MAKE THAT BID
gJGhRrSaPlQ_3 0 YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO GET TWENTY-FIVE
gJGhRrSaPlQ_4 0 IF YOU DON'T HAVE TWENTY-FIVE COUNTERS YOU WILL NOT MAKE YOUR BID SO KEEP IN MIND THE STRONGER THE MELD YOU HAVE IN YOUR HAND THE MORE ROOM YOU HAVE FOR BIDDING
gJGhRrSaPlQ_5 0 FOR EXAMPLE IF WE HAD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MELD WE HAD A DOUBLE RUN IN A SUIT THAT'S A POWERFUL HAND NOW WE HAVE LOTS OF ROOM BECAUSE ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS MAKE OUR TWENTY MELD THAT'S THE BASIC REQUIREMENT WE SAVE OUR TWENTY MELD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY POINTS IS GOING TO PICK UP AN AWFUL LOT OF ROOM FOR ERROR IS WE FALL SHORT ON COUNTERS THAT IS THAT IF WE DON'T HAVE MORE THAN IF WE HAVE THE MINIMUM COUNTERS THAT'S FINE
gJGhRrSaPlQ_6 0 WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE TWENTY AND THAT'S THE KEY NUMBER SO AGAIN MELD BIDDING AND COUNTERS VERY IMPORTANT AND YOU SHOULD REMEMBER THOSE COMBINATIONS
GVLVEmMFvNE_1 0 DR JOE NEELY AND I PRACTICE WITH THE BARTON OAKS DENTAL GROUP
GVLVEmMFvNE_2 0 I'M GOING TO DISCUSS DENTAL PROCEDURES WHICH IS A VERY BROAD CATEGORY
GVLVEmMFvNE_3 0 A DENTAL PROCEDURE CAN BE ANYTHING AS SIMPLE AS A CLEANING WHICH IS REMOVING THE HARD DEPOSITS THAT YOU CAN'T GET OFF YOURSELF OFF YOUR TEETH
GVLVEmMFvNE_4 0 OR REMOVING SOFT DEPOSITS THAT ARE IN AREAS THAT ARE SO FAR UP INTO THE GUM YOU PHYSICALLY CAN'T GET TO THEM
GVLVEmMFvNE_5 0 TO SCALING ROOT PLANING WHICH IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR IN NATURE TO CLEANING
GVLVEmMFvNE_6 0 EXCEPT IT REQUIRES ANESTHESIA BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE ATTACHMENT OF THE GUM TO THE TOOTH IN ORDER TO GET BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE HARD TARTAR TO REMOVE IT
GVLVEmMFvNE_7 0 YOU HAVE A DENTAL PROCEDURE OF A SEALANT WHICH IS SIMPLY CLEANING OUT THE GROOVES OF THE TOOTH
GVLVEmMFvNE_8 0 THE UNDECAYED GROOVES OF THE TOOTH
GVLVEmMFvNE_9 0 ASSURING YOURSELF THAT THERE IS NO DECAY AND THEN ETCHING THE TOOTH CREATING SOME KIND OF ACID EDGE TO THE TOOTH THEN APPLYING A PLASTIC COATING THAT FITS IN THE GROOVES OF THE TEETH TO PROTECT IT AGAINST DECAY
GVLVEmMFvNE_10 0 YOU HAVE A FILLING WHICH IS SIMPLY GOING IN AND PHYSICALLY REMOVING ANY INFECTED PART OF THE TOOTH ENAMEL
GVLVEmMFvNE_11 0 THE BACTERIA LIVE OFF OF PLAQUE WHICH IS A COMBINATION OF BACTERIA AND FOOD SOURCE AND THE GELATINOUS MASS THAT STICKS TO THE TOOTH
GVLVEmMFvNE_12 0 ONCE THE BY PRODUCT IS ACID ONCE THE ACID EATS THROUGH THE HARD OUTER SHELL OF THE TOOTH IT CAN THE BACTERIA CAN NOW LIVE OFF OF THE INTERNAL PORTION OF THE TOOTH
GVLVEmMFvNE_13 0 AND IN ORDER TO KEEP IT FROM DESTROYING THE TOOTH YOU HAVE TO GO IN AND PHYSICALLY CUT THAT PART OUT
GVLVEmMFvNE_14 0 AND THEN THAT PART OF THE TOOTH THAT'S BEEN REMOVED IS RESTORED WITH A FILLING
GVLVEmMFvNE_15 0 AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS TYPES OF FILLING MATERIALS
GVLVEmMFvNE_16 0 WHEN THE DEFECT BECOMES LARGE ENOUGH THAT STRUCTURALLY YOU CAN'T THE TOOTH CAN'T SUPPORT A FILLING ANY LONGER
GVLVEmMFvNE_17 0 THEN THE OPPOSITE IS DONE
GVLVEmMFvNE_18 0 MORE OF THE PERIMETER OF THE TOOTH IS REMOVED AND THEN A CROWN IS DONE OVER THE TOOTH
GVLVEmMFvNE_19 0 A CROWN BRINGS STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FROM THE OUTSIDE TO THE TOOTH WHEREAS A FILLING REQUIRES A TOOTH TO PROVIDE THE STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FOR THE FILLING
GVLVEmMFvNE_20 0 NOW CROWNS CAN BE A COMBINATION OF METAL AND PORCELAIN TO GAIN THE COMBINATION OF STRENGTH FROM THE METAL AND THE AESTHETICS OF PORCELAIN
GVLVEmMFvNE_21 0 IT CAN BE ALL PORCELAIN FOR GREATER AESTHETICS OR IT CAN BE ALL METAL IN AREAS WHERE NOTHING ELSE IS SAVED
GVLVEmMFvNE_22 0 YOU ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY PROCEDURE WOULD BE A VENEER WHICH IS NOTHING MORE THAN JUST PART A THING PART OF A CROWN
GVLVEmMFvNE_23 0 IT'S EXACTLY LIKE A PORCELAIN CROWN IN FACT IN TODAY'S WORLD WHERE VENEER STOPS AND A CROWN STARTS IS A VERY VERY GRAY AREA
GVLVEmMFvNE_24 0 BECAUSE IT'S ALL A MATTER OF PERCENTAGES
GVLVEmMFvNE_25 0 OTHER PROCEDURES WOULD BE ROOT CANALS WHICH IS THE REMOVAL OF THE CONTENTS OF A TOOTH
GVLVEmMFvNE_26 0 EXTRACTION WHICH WOULD BE THE REMOVAL OF A TOOTH
GVLVEmMFvNE_27 0 BIOPSY WHICH WOULD BE THE REMOVAL OF TISSUE TO BE STUDIED UNDER A MICROSCOPE
GVLVEmMFvNE_28 0 AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON
gH-FfNW0BDM_2 0 MY NAME IS TERRY NEVEN
gH-FfNW0BDM_3 0 I AM THE ADMINISTRATOR OF CALIFORNIA HOME EDUCATORS AND PRINCIPAL OF SUNLAND CHRISTIAN SCHOOL
gH-FfNW0BDM_4 0 IN THIS CLIP WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS HOME SCHOOLING RIGHT FOR ME
gH-FfNW0BDM_5 0 MAYBE YOU HAVE BEGAN TO LOOK INTO HOME SCHOOLING AND HAVE FIGURED IT OUT HOW IT WORKS AND WHERE IT BEGINS
gH-FfNW0BDM_6 0 IS IT RIGHT FOR ME
gH-FfNW0BDM_7 0 SHOULD MY FAMILY HOME SCHOOL
gH-FfNW0BDM_8 0 THERE ARE A FEW POINTS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER AS YOU APPROACH THIS QUESTION
gH-FfNW0BDM_9 0 FIRST OFF THE NEEDS OF YOUR CHILD
gH-FfNW0BDM_10 0 IS YOUR CHILD IN A POSITION IN LIFE WHERE HOME SCHOOL WILL BENEFIT THEM
gH-FfNW0BDM_11 0 IS YOUR FAMILY IN A POSITION WHERE YOU CAN HOME SCHOOL THEM
gH-FfNW0BDM_12 0 FINANCES MAY BE AN ISSUE
gH-FfNW0BDM_13 0 WE ALSO WANT TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT WHEN YOU BEGIN THIS PROCESS TO STAY COMMITTED TO IT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME REALIZING THERE WILL BE WONDERFUL DAYS THERE WILL BE DAYS OF BLESSING AND THERE WILL BE DAYS OF CHALLENGES
gH-FfNW0BDM_14 0 JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE TEACHING YOUR CHILD AT HOME DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE GOING TO WANT TO LEARN
gH-FfNW0BDM_15 0 YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR THAT
gH-FfNW0BDM_16 0 THE BENEFITS OF HOME SCHOOLING WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT AND WILL TALK ABOUT ARE THINGS TO BE CONSIDERED
gH-FfNW0BDM_17 0 WHY IS HOME SCHOOLING RIGHT FOR ME
gH-FfNW0BDM_18 0 WILL IT HELP OUR FAMILY PULL TOGETHER
gH-FfNW0BDM_19 0 WILL IT HELP US IN OUR PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIP
gH-FfNW0BDM_20 0 AS YOU CONSIDER THESE YOU CAN COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT ALL FACTORS BEING CORRECT HOME SCHOOLING CAN WORK FOR JUST ABOUT ANY STUDENT AND ANY FAMILY
h2dZglgVX3I_1 0 NOW THERE ARE VARIOUS METHODS OF DELIVERY ONCE YOU HAVE THE MEDICATION IN THERE AGAIN DEPENDING ON THE AGE OF THE PERSON
h2dZglgVX3I_2 0 FOR MYSELF AS I WAS MENTIONING MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH THE NEBULIZER WAS WHEN MY SON WAS ABOUT NINE MONTHS OLD AND HE PROBABLY WOULD NOT OF TOLERATED THE MASK BEING ON HIS FACE
h2dZglgVX3I_3 0 MOST KIDS THAT AGE ARE GOING TO TRY TO TEAR UP THE MASK AND MAKES FOR A FAIRLY UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE ALL THE WAY AROUND
h2dZglgVX3I_4 0 BUT FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE A LITTLE BIT OLDER OR ADULTS ONE WAY OF DELIVERING THE MEDICATION I'LL SHOW YOU RIGHT HERE IS TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY AGAIN THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
h2dZglgVX3I_5 0 PUTTING THIS TOGETHER LIKE THIS YOU'VE GOT THE TUBE HERE AND THIS IS THE PIECE YOU WANT TO TURN IT LIKE SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY PUT IN THEIR MOUTH
h2dZglgVX3I_6 0 THEN ONCE YOU HAVE THAT ASSEMBLED AGAIN YOU'RE GOING TO KIND OF PUSH AND TWIST A LITTLE BIT AND THEN THE PERSON WOULD ACTUALLY HOLD IT AND PUT THIS IN THEIR MOUTH AND BE ABLE TO BREATHE THE MEDICATION IN THAT WAY SO THAT'S ONE WAY
h2dZglgVX3I_7 0 AND THEN THE OTHER METHOD OF YOU KNOW FOR A CHILD OBVIOUSLY THIS IS FOR A CHILD'S USE IT'S GOT THE DINOSAUR ON IT AND MY KIDS DID APPRECIATE THAT THE MASK FORM
h2dZglgVX3I_8 0 ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS DIRECTLY PUT THE MASK RIGHT ONTO HERE AND THEN OF COURSE THIS WOULD GO AROUND THE CHILD'S HEAD AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO JUST GO AHEAD AND BREATHE IN IT
h2dZglgVX3I_9 0 AS THIS ALLOWS FOR SOME AIRFLOW OUT THE TUBE HERE THIS ALSO ALLOWS FOR SOME ESCAPING OF AIR AND MIST THROUGH THE HOLES RIGHT HERE
h2dZglgVX3I_10 0 SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE KIND OF A SUFFOCATING TYPE OF EXPERIENCE
gxwT5v4wbfQ_1 0 HI MY NAME'S JOE
gxwT5v4wbfQ_2 0 I'M IN BREAK TIME BILLIARDS IN WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA
gxwT5v4wbfQ_3 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO SHOOT OVER AN OBJECT BALL
gxwT5v4wbfQ_4 0 OCCASIONALLY WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING YOU GET LEFT A SHOT WHERE THE CUE BALL IS CLOSE TO ANOTHER BALL OR YOU PLAYED POSITION AND YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED IT VERY WELL AND YOU'VE GOT TO SHOOT OVER A BALL
gxwT5v4wbfQ_5 0 NOW WHAT MAKES IT SO DIFFICULT IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE TO ELEVATE THE END OF YOUR CUE STICK IF YOU DO NOT HIT DEAD CENTER ON THE BALL WHATEVER ENGLISHES THAT YOU WILL ACCIDENTALLY PUT ON THE CUE BALL WILL MAGNIFY BECAUSE IT'LL BE A SLIGHT MASSE SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HIT THE CENTER OF THE BALL OR IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON USING ENGLISH TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALLOW FOR IT
gxwT5v4wbfQ_6 0 YOU HAVE TO MAKE A BRIDGE THAT'S UP ON YOUR FINGERTIPS SO THAT YOU'LL BE OVER THE BALL
gxwT5v4wbfQ_7 0 YOUR CUE STICK WILL BE ELEVATED IN THE BACK WHICH YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WILL MASSE A BALL IF YOU PUT ANY ENGLISH ON IT
gxwT5v4wbfQ_8 0 SO NOW YOU TAKE YOUR STROKES AND YOU JUST SHOOT OVER THE BALL AND YOU MAKE THE BALL IN IN THE POCKET
gxwT5v4wbfQ_9 0 AND THAT'S HOW YOU SHOOT OVER A BALL
GQx37S2WQtc_1 0 WELL IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE READY TO GO
GQx37S2WQtc_2 0 WE GOT OUR VEHICLE ON THE TRAILER WE HAVE IT SECURED AT ALL FOUR CORNERS
GQx37S2WQtc_3 0 WE'VE PUT THE RAMPS IN THE TRAILER PUT THE PIN BACK IN SO THE RAMPS STAY IN THE TRAILER
GQx37S2WQtc_4 0 WE GOT OUR BATTERY PACK PUT AWAY
GQx37S2WQtc_5 0 WE HAVE OUR CONTROL FOR OUR WINCH PUT AWAY
GQx37S2WQtc_6 0 WE'RE READY TO GO
GQx37S2WQtc_7 0 MAKE SURE RELEASE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE ON THE PICK UP BEFORE YOU LEAVE
GQx37S2WQtc_8 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE GLOBE GOING AND ALLOW SOME EXTRA TIME TO TURN TO STOP TO ACCELERATE AND ALL THOSE THINGS
GQx37S2WQtc_9 0 KEEP IN MIND OTHER PEOPLE AROUND YOU MAY HAVE NEVER PULLED A TRAILER
GQx37S2WQtc_10 0 IT'S A LITTLE UNFAMILIAR FOR THEM ALSO
GQx37S2WQtc_11 0 JUST BE SAFE OUT THERE AND HAUL YOUR CAR HOME
gNceU5yH6Xc_1 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT NOW IS PROGRAM CHANGING
gNceU5yH6Xc_2 0 PROGRAM CHANGING IS BASICALLY CHANGING THE SOUND THEY CALL SOUNDS PROGRAMS
gNceU5yH6Xc_3 0 WHEN YOU'RE CHANGING PROGRAMS YOU NEED TO KNOW THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF THE SOUND
gNceU5yH6Xc_4 0 EACH MACHINE HAS DIFFERENT NUMBERS THAT THEY LABEL THEIR SOUNDS AS
gNceU5yH6Xc_5 0 SO THE FIRST STEP IS FINDING OUT WHICH NUMBERS YOU'RE GOING TO CHANGE
gNceU5yH6Xc_6 0 SO IF YOU HAVE ONE SOUND THAT'S A STRING YOU GOT TO FIND OUT WHAT NUMBER THAT IS
gNceU5yH6Xc_7 0 AND THEN IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE IT TO A GUITAR FOR THE SECOND MEASURE YOU NEED TO FIND OUT THAT NUMBER AS WELL
gNceU5yH6Xc_8 0 AND THEN ONCE YOU DO THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY ASSIGN CERTAIN MEASURES WHERE THIS PROGRAM CHANGES TO THIS PROGRAM AND THIS CHANGES BACK TO THIS PROGRAM
gNceU5yH6Xc_9 0 YOU CAN DO THAT ALL WITHIN PRO-TOOLS AUTOMATION SO THAT IT AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHES THE SOUND
gNceU5yH6Xc_10 0 YOU CAN DO THIS TO ANY SOUND AND TO EVERY SINGLE TRACK IF YOU WANTED TO
gNceU5yH6Xc_11 0 AND YOU CAN CHANGE THIS TO ANY MACHINE AS WELL
gNceU5yH6Xc_12 0 YOU CAN CHANGE IT FROM THE MPC DRUMS AND ALL THE SUDDEN JUST SWITCH TO LOOP WITHIN THE TRITON DRUMS
gNceU5yH6Xc_13 0 AND THIS WILL HELP A LOT AS FAR AS CREATING DIFFERENT FEELS AND GIVING YOU WHOLE NEW SOUNDS TO YOUR TRACK
gNceU5yH6Xc_14 0 NOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR TRACK WITHIN PRO-TOOL YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR MIDI TRACK IS ON PROGRAM CHANGE
gNceU5yH6Xc_15 0 AND WITHIN PROGRAM CHANGE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SET UP THE DIFFERENT CHANGES
hbcq9y-4upM_1 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT DOWN TO THE FLOOR
hbcq9y-4upM_2 0 YOU KNOW YOU CAN GET SO MUCH BENEFIT IN YOGA AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO STAND UP
hbcq9y-4upM_3 0 THAT'S ANOTHER TIME SO FOR NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU VERY VERY POWERFUL WAY FOR STRENGTHENING ABDOMINALS BUTTOCKS EVERYTHING STRETCHING EVERYTHING STRENGTHENING EVERYTHING AND GOING TO THE FLOOR AT THE SAME TIME AND THEN COMING UP
hbcq9y-4upM_4 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO START HERE SHOULDERS UP BACK DOWN RAISE ARMS UP OPEN KNEES TOES UP CHIN TO THE CHEST
hbcq9y-4upM_5 0 PLEASE REMEMBER EVERY TIME YOUR CHIN COMES TO YOUR CHEST YOU ARE STRENGTHENING THOSE ABDOMINALS SO CHIN TO THE CHEST SQUEEZE THOSE ABS NOW AS YOU ROLL DOWN THE LEGS STRAIGHTEN THE TOES POINT ROLLING ONE VERTEBRAE AT A TIME DOWN YOU GET SOME NICE ADJUSTMENTS DOING THIS
hbcq9y-4upM_6 0 OH YEAH I JUST FELT ONE OKAY ARMS STRETCH ALL THE WAY BACK THIS IS SUCH A GOOD STRETCH STRETCH STRETCH STRETCH STRETCH STRETCH OKAY WE'LL COME UP ONCE AND THEN WE'LL GO BACK DOWN AGAIN
hbcq9y-4upM_7 0 I WANT YOU TO ROUND THOSE ARMS COMING UP HEAD UP CHIN TO THE CHEST KNEES TOES UP ROLL UP STRETCH FORWARD COME UP AND YOU CAN DO AS MANY OF THESE AS YOU LIKE COMING BACK DOWN YOU CAN DO TWENTY YOU CAN DO FIFTY IF YOU WANT OR YOU CAN JUST RELAX WHEN YOU GET TO THE FLOOR AND MOVE ON
hbcq9y-4upM_8 0 SO VERY GOOD
Gj1vLHzky9c_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT I'M GOING TO BE SHOWING A POSSIBLE APPLICATION OF USING FLYING DIAGONAL FORM OF SOMEBODY KIND OF CHARGING AT YOU FROM BEHIND
Gj1vLHzky9c_2 0 SO IN THE TAI CHI FORM WE'RE HERE WE STEP OUT DIAGONALLY COME AROUND AND OPEN UP
Gj1vLHzky9c_3 0 SO IF RAY IS COMING AT ME FROM BEHIND I STEP INTO HIM ALREADY
Gj1vLHzky9c_4 0 AND IF YOU NOTICE I STEPPED BEHIND HIM
Gj1vLHzky9c_5 0 SO I'M AT A FORTY-FIVE DEGREE ANGLE
Gj1vLHzky9c_6 0 BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT I DON'T HAVE SPACE BETWEEN US
Gj1vLHzky9c_7 0 I'M TIGHT IN HERE
Gj1vLHzky9c_8 0 NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS FINISH THE MOVEMENT AND HE GOES FLYING
Gj1vLHzky9c_9 0 SO IF HE COMES AT ME WE'LL DO THIS SLOWLY SO YOU CAN REALLY SEE THIS IS I STEP BEHIND AND HE'LL GO FLYING
Gj1vLHzky9c_10 0 THIS ONE WE TRY NOT TO DO TOO REAL TOO FAST BECAUSE IT REALLY WILL TORQUE THE PERSON'S BACK IN A VERY REAL WAY
Gj1vLHzky9c_11 0 I HAD A TEACHER PUT ME OUT OF COMMISSION FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS ONE TIME WITH THIS MOVEMENT
Gj1vLHzky9c_12 0 SO AS HE STEPS IN I STEP BEHIND
Gj1vLHzky9c_13 0 I DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS
Gj1vLHzky9c_14 0 IT'S NOT A CONCERN BECAUSE IF I'M PUSHING THIS WAY AND THIS IS PUSHING THAT WAY WHAT'S HE GOING TO WORRY ABOUT
Gj1vLHzky9c_15 0 IF I BREAK HIM IN THE MIDDLE HOW MUCH POWER IS THIS GOING TO HAVE LEFT TO IT
Gj1vLHzky9c_16 0 SO THIS IS THE IDEA FLYING DIAGONAL FORM
Gj1vLHzky9c_17 0 ONE GOES ONE WAY ONE GOES THE OTHER WAY
H0JD_OtYloQ_1 0 THERE ARE MANY OPTIONS FOR LITTER BOXES FOR KITTENS
H0JD_OtYloQ_2 0 AS THE KITTENS ARE QUITE YOUNG AND JUST LEARNING TO USE A LITTER BOX I RECOMMEND THESE SORT OF FLAT TRAY LITTER BOXES
H0JD_OtYloQ_3 0 SIMILAR TO THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT MEAT COMES IN IN THE GROCERY STORE
H0JD_OtYloQ_4 0 AND YOU CAN PUT A SMALL AMOUNT OF LITTER MAYBE A LITTLE MORE THAN THIS AND THAT WAY THE KITTENS CAN JUST GET IN THERE AND THEY CAN LEARN TO FEEL THE TEXTURE OF IT SCRATCH AROUND BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY HAVE TO JUMP AND CLIMB IN
H0JD_OtYloQ_5 0 WHERE THEY'RE YOUNG AND THEY'RE NOT THAT WELL COORDINATED YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S EASY FOR THEM TO GET IN AND OUT OF THEIR LITTER BOX
H0JD_OtYloQ_6 0 SEE IF THIS LITTLE GIRL WILL GO OUT FOR US
H0JD_OtYloQ_7 0 WELL WE'RE GOING TO TRADE TO THIS ONE
H0JD_OtYloQ_8 0 THIS IS ALSO A LITTLE BIT OLDER KITTEN WOULD DO BETTER WITH THIS TYPE OF A LITTER BOX
H0JD_OtYloQ_9 0 IT'S A LITTLE BIT HIGHER SIDED SO THAT THEY DON'T KICK LITTER AROUND
H0JD_OtYloQ_10 0 PROBABLY A FIVE OF SIX WEEK OLD KITTEN WILL LIKE THAT
H0JD_OtYloQ_11 0 LAUGHTER YOU SEE THIS KITTEN DOESN'T LIKE IT VERY MUCH
H0JD_OtYloQ_12 0 AND THEN AS THEY GET OLDER AND THEY'RE ABLE TO JUMP IN AND OUT THEY CAN USE A FULL SIDED LITTER BOX
H0JD_OtYloQ_13 0 KITTENS TEND TO PLAY A LOT IN THEIR LITTER SO YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT TOO MUCH LITTER IN THE BOX KEEP IT KIND OF THIN
H0JD_OtYloQ_14 0 AND THE HIGH SIDES WILL KEEP THEM FROM KICKING THE LITTER ALL AROUND
H0JD_OtYloQ_15 0 BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THIS BOX IS AS BIG AS THIS KITTEN SO IT WOULDN'T BE APPROPRIATE FOR THIS AGE OF A KITTY
gZd3FS1k6E4_1 0 NEXT WE ARE GOING TO SLICE OUR SWEET POTATO
gZd3FS1k6E4_2 0 FOR THE SWEET POTATO BECAUSE IT HAS SORT OF A DIRTY OUTSIDE WE ARE GOING TO PEEL THAT
gZd3FS1k6E4_3 0 THERE IS NOTHING IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SPECIAL PRETTY COLOR ON THE OUTSIDE SO WE WANT TO PEEL OFF THAT OUTER SKIN BEFORE WE SLICE
gZd3FS1k6E4_4 0 OKAY ONCE IT IS PEEL AGAIN YOU WANT TO FIND A SPOT TO FLATTEN THE BOTTOM WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO BE LAYING IT DOWN
gZd3FS1k6E4_5 0 YOU CAN CUT THE SWEET POTATO THIS WAY IT IS A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT AND GET A LONG PETAL
gZd3FS1k6E4_6 0 OR YOU CAN CUT IT THIS WAY AGAIN AND GET SMALLER ROUND PETALS
gZd3FS1k6E4_7 0 SWEET POTATO CAN BE A LOT DRIER AND MORE BRITTLE
gZd3FS1k6E4_8 0 IT DEPENDS ON THE SWEET POTATO
gZd3FS1k6E4_9 0 YOU MAY HAVE TO CUT EXTRA PETALS
gZd3FS1k6E4_10 0 YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT THIS IS A LOT STIFFER THAN OUR RADISH AND OUR PURPLE TOP TURNIP WERE
gZd3FS1k6E4_11 0 SO YOU WANT TO CUT SLICE IT AS THINLY AS POSSIBLE
gZd3FS1k6E4_12 0 AND YOU CAN SLICE THIS IN A FOOD PROCESSOR
gZd3FS1k6E4_13 0 YOU CAN USE A MANDOLIN OR SOME OTHER SLICING ATTACHMENT
hFJLCCFmEPs_1 0 SO WHENEVER I'M DONE TONING FOR THE DAY YOU KNOW ONE OF THE HARDEST PARTS ABOUT DOING THIS STUFF ON YOUR OWN NOT IN A CLASSROOM AROUND OTHER PEOPLE IS THAT I CAN KIND OF DO WHATEVER I WANT
hFJLCCFmEPs_2 0 AND SO IT'S REALLY EASY FOR ME TO JUST NOT WANT TO CLEAN UP
hFJLCCFmEPs_3 0 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S A REALLY BAD HABIT TO GET INTO AND IT REALLY WON'T GET YOU ANYWHERE
hFJLCCFmEPs_4 0 SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO DISPOSE OF MY BLEACH AND MY SEPIA AND I'M JUST GOING TO GO GET SOME BROWN JUGS
hFJLCCFmEPs_5 0 BECAUSE I'M GOING TO USE THESE AGAIN I ONLY PRINTED A TONED A COUPLE PRINTS WITH YOU GUYS TODAY
hFJLCCFmEPs_6 0 SO I'M GOING TO DISPOSE OF THEM
hFJLCCFmEPs_7 0 I'M NEVER JUST GOING TO DUMP THEM ON THE GRASS OKAY
hFJLCCFmEPs_8 0 THAT'S THE ONE THING YOU DON'T EVER WANT TO DO NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE
hFJLCCFmEPs_9 0 AND THE OTHER THING IF YOU HAVE KIDS OR ANYBODY DO NOT JUST WALK AWAY FROM THESE
hFJLCCFmEPs_10 0 NO MATTER HOW TEMPTING IT MAY BE
hFJLCCFmEPs_11 0 YOU REALLY NEVER KNOW WHO MAY JUST COME OUT OF CURIOSITY TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE UP TO AND ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY BAD SITUATION ON YOUR HANDS IN NO TIME
hFJLCCFmEPs_12 0 THIS STUFF IS POISONOUS
hFJLCCFmEPs_13 0 SO AGAIN I'M JUST GOING TO PUT THESE BACK INTO TWO BROWN JUGS SEAL THEM UP AND USE THEM AGAIN THE NEXT TIME I PRINT
hFJLCCFmEPs_14 0 THE COFFEE YOU CAN JUST THROW AWAY
Hdxe01nmLRI_1 0 I'VE HIT IT WITH MY TEE SHOT BUT I'M ON AN UPHILL LIE OR THE BALLS ABOVE MY FEET
Hdxe01nmLRI_2 0 SO ON MY NEXT SHOT THIS WILL PRODUCE A HOOK
Hdxe01nmLRI_3 0 NOW I'M GOING TO BE USING A MID-IRON HERE
Hdxe01nmLRI_4 0 THE LOWER THE LOFT THE MORE SIDE SPIN YOU GET
Hdxe01nmLRI_5 0 SO NOW THIS BALL'S GOING TO HOOK MORE THAN MY SAND WEDGE OR PITCHING WEDGE WILL
Hdxe01nmLRI_6 0 SO I HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT
Hdxe01nmLRI_7 0 SO I HAVE A LONGER SHOT
Hdxe01nmLRI_8 0 I HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HOOK
Hdxe01nmLRI_9 0 THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO PRACTICE THESE SHOTS BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO KNOW HOW MUCH A BALL HOOKS WHEN YOU SWING ON THE PRACTICE RANGE BEFORE YOU HAVE TO DO IT ON THE GOLF COURSE
Hdxe01nmLRI_10 0 BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T ACCOUNT FOR IT PROPERLY YOU COULD END UP IN THE ROUGH OR THE TREES OR WHO KNOWS WHERE
Hdxe01nmLRI_11 0 SO THE BALL'S ABOVE MY FEET
Hdxe01nmLRI_12 0 I'M GOING TO STEP INTO I'M GOING TO LINE UP AT MY TARGET AND THEN I'M GOING TO AIM TO THE RIGHT A LITTLE BIT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HOOK
Hdxe01nmLRI_13 0 BECAUSE THE BALL'S ABOVE MY FEET IF I DON'T ACCOUNT FOR THE CONTOUR OF THE SLOPE HERE I CAN SWING RIGHT INTO IT
Hdxe01nmLRI_14 0 PLUS NOW THAT I'M USING A LONGER IRON I HAVE TO ALSO ACCOUNT FOR THAT
Hdxe01nmLRI_15 0 SO IT TAKES A BIT OF PRACTICE TO GET THIS SHOT
Hdxe01nmLRI_16 0 SO YOU WANT TO LINE UP YOU WANT TO GET A NICE STANCE AIM A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF YOUR TARGET AND THEN TAKE A NICE EASY SWING
Hdxe01nmLRI_17 0 BECAUSE WITH THE HOOK YOU'RE GOING TO GET MORE DISTANCE
Hdxe01nmLRI_18 0 SO THAT'S HOW YOU PLAY THE LONGER IRON WHEN THE BALL IS ABOVE YOUR FEET
gn_A32VBRDo_1 0 AND SO WE'RE GOING TO WORK UP THE ARM TO THE BICEP AREA HERE AND HERE WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS JUST SOME NICE GENTLE MASSAGING ON THE TRICEPS THE BACK OF THE ARM
gn_A32VBRDo_2 0 WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT NOTICE I'M SUPPORTING THE ARM I'M NOT JUST LAYING IT DANGLE
gn_A32VBRDo_3 0 HERE I LET THE ARM REST ON THE TABLE AND WORK THE FRONT SIDE OF IT OR THE BICEP
gn_A32VBRDo_4 0 THEN AGAIN WORK YOUR WAY UP AND HERE AT THE SHOULDER YOU'RE JUST GOING TO DO SOME NICE GENTLE MASSAGING KIND OF LIKE A ROCKING MOTION LIKE YOU WOULD A YOUNG CHILD WHERE YOU'RE JUST KIND OF ROCKING THEM TO SLEEP
gn_A32VBRDo_5 0 THIS IS A VERY COMFORTING AND LOVING TOUCH RIGHT HERE WHERE YOU'RE JUST LETTING THE PERSON KNOW THAT ONE YOU CARE AND TWO IT'S OKAY TO RELAX
gn_A32VBRDo_6 0 SO YOU JUST CONTINUE TO WORK YOUR WAY UP THE SHOULDER A LITTLE TOWARDS THE NECK
gn_A32VBRDo_7 0 TRY AND GET TO THE BACK OF THE SHOULDER A LITTLE BIT AS WELL AND THEN WORK YOUR WAY BACK DOWN AND THEN FINISH AT THE HAND A NICE GENTLE MASSAGE TOUCH ON THE HAND
gn_A32VBRDo_8 0 THAT'S IT AND THEN IN THE NEXT SEGMENT WE'LL BE WORKING ON THE HEAD NECK AND SHOULDER AREA
HiR0oU833p4_1 0 ALRIGHT SO HERE WE HAVE THE BOARD LAMINATED AND WE'RE JUST OUT IN THE SUN TODAY'S NOT THE MOST SUNNY DAY BUT LIKE I SAID IT COULD BE RAINING OUT HERE AND THIS RESIN WOULD STILL DRY BECAUSE ALL YOU NEED IS UV LIGHT
HiR0oU833p4_2 0 SO WHAT I USUALLY DO IS USE MY FINGER
HiR0oU833p4_4 0 SEE THE LITTLE WAXY SURFACE THAT YOU PUT OVER THE TOP
HiR0oU833p4_6 0 WE FLIP IT OVER
HiR0oU833p4_7 0 WE DID THE NOSE AS WELL ON THE TOP OF THE DECK AND WE'LL JUST WAIT AND GIVE THAT A COUPLE MINUTES OUT HERE AND THAT WILL CURE AS WELL AND THERE IT IS
HiR0oU833p4_8 0 SO JUST LIKE THAT INSTEAD OF SITTING AROUND FOR YOU KNOW AN HOUR OR LIKE AN HOUR AND A HALF LIKE BEFORE NOW WE HAVE A CURE TIME OF ABOUT TWO MINUTES JUST TO BE ABLE TO PUT THAT SANDING COAT ON
HiR0oU833p4_9 0 THAT SANDING COAT WILL WANT TO BE OUT HERE A LITTLE LONGER BUT YOU KNOW THERE IT IS WE SPEED IT UP COME OVER HERE AND WE'LL PUT SOME HOT COAT RESIN ON THERE
HaJFbA_27Sw_1 0 HI I'M MATT CAIL AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A SCARECROW COSTUME
HaJFbA_27Sw_2 0 SCARECROWS MAY BE INANIMATE BUT THEY ARE ALSO HARD WORKERS
HaJFbA_27Sw_3 0 THEY ARE OUT THERE IN THE FIELDS AND ALL DAY LONG KEEPING THE CROWS AND OTHER BIRDS AWAY FROM THE CROP
HaJFbA_27Sw_4 0 BECAUSE OF THAT BLUE JEANS ARE GREAT FOR SCARECROW OUTFITS
HaJFbA_27Sw_5 0 AND OFTEN TIMES YOU MAY OWN A PAIR
HaJFbA_27Sw_6 0 ALTHOUGH IT MAY NOT BE QUITE RAGGEDY ENOUGH FOR OUR PURPOSES
HaJFbA_27Sw_7 0 YOU WANT A NICE OLDER WORN PAIR OF BLUE JEANS
HaJFbA_27Sw_8 0 I MEAN NOTHING SAYS BASIC HARD WORK ETHIC AND PUTTING IN YOUR EIGHT HOURS A DAY THAN BLUE JEANS DOES
HaJFbA_27Sw_9 0 IS THE BOTTOMS TROUSERS OF THE WORKERS AND SCARECROWS LOOK REALLY GREAT WITH BLUE JEANS
HaJFbA_27Sw_10 0 SO THIS IS NOT QUITE A MUST HAVE BUT IT'S CLOSE
HaJFbA_27Sw_11 0 IT'S VERY VERY CLOSE
HaJFbA_27Sw_12 0 SO DEFINITELY CONSIDER STRONGLY GETTING BLUE JEANS
HaJFbA_27Sw_13 0 AS A CLOSE RUNNER UP GRAY BOTTOMS ALSO WORK REALLY WELL
HaJFbA_27Sw_14 0 AS LONG AS THESE ARE NOT ANY TYPE OF DESIGNER JEANS OR YOUR KHAKI VARIOUS BRANDS
HaJFbA_27Sw_15 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE AND KIND OF HAVE MORE OF A DENIM QUALITY TO IT
HaJFbA_27Sw_16 0 SO GRAY JEANS ARE OKAY TOO
HaJFbA_27Sw_17 0 BUT DEFINITELY MY TOP PICK FOR SCARECROW BOTTOMS ARE GOOD OLD BLUE JEANS
GxlpJPyyGyk_1 0 ALRIGHT THE DRINK WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE IS CALLED A PINK FIX

h7r5fgguvbQ_5 0 WHEN YOU HIT JUST ABOVE THE KNEE YOU WILL SHOW A VERY NICE LONG LEAN LEG NO MATTER WHAT YOUR BODY TYPE IS
h7r5fgguvbQ_6 0 ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE TO JUST GO AHEAD AND SHOW YOUR LEG IS TO WEAR THESE TYPE OF SHORTS THAT ALSO HIT JUST ABOVE THE KNEE AND THEY ARE FORM FITTING FROM THE TOP ALL THE WAY TO THE KNEE AND YOU CAN SEE THE REST OF THE LEG
h7r5fgguvbQ_7 0 ANOTHER NICE WAY TO ACCENTUATE LEGS AS WE ALL KNOW LADIES IS TO WEAR THESE TYPES OF HEELS

g57_-ikjRZM_5 0 ONCE IT'S DONE I LIKE TO ADD SOME FRESH CORIANDER TO IT
g57_-ikjRZM_6 0 FRESHNESS IS GOOD
g57_-ikjRZM_7 0 ADD SOME GARM MASALA POWDER
g57_-ikjRZM_8 0 WE DID ADD SOME WHILE FRYING BUT IF YOU ADD SOME MORE LATER IT JUST MAKES IT MORE FLAVORFUL
g57_-ikjRZM_9 0 THE CURRY IS VERY LESS
g57_-ikjRZM_10 0 WE ATE QUITE A BIT OF IT
g57_-ikjRZM_11 0 WE WERE HUNGRY BUT WE HAVE ENOUGH
g57_-ikjRZM_12 0 WE MIX THIS UP AND MY VEGETABLE CURRY IS ALL READY
g57_-ikjRZM_13 0 THIS IS THE BASIS OF HOW YOU MAKE INDIAN VEGETABLE CURRY
g57_-ikjRZM_14 0 THE VEGETABLE COULD BE ANYTHING
g57_-ikjRZM_15 0 YOU CAN EVEN MAKE IT INTO LIQUID FORM
g57_-ikjRZM_16 0 YOU CAN TAKE POTATOES AND PEAS AND JUST ADD MORE WATER SO IT'S LIKE A GRAVY
g57_-ikjRZM_17 0 YOU HAVE A GRAVY INSTEAD OF LIKE DRY VEGETABLE
g57_-ikjRZM_18 0 IT'S ABOUT THE BASIS

g57_-ikjRZM_37 0 THIS IS MONA FROM EXPERT VILLAGE
GykPz9zF12I_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS ADRIAN ARCEO AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BEING A CLEAR COMMUNICATOR
GykPz9zF12I_2 0 NOW ONE OF THE KEY TRAITS THAT ALL GOOD FIRST AND THIRD BASE COACHES HAVE IS THAT THEY'RE VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND THEY'RE VERY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THEY SAY
GykPz9zF12I_3 0 SO LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE YOU'VE GOT A GUY ON FIRST BASE AND YOU TELL HIM FREEZE ON A LINE
GykPz9zF12I_4 0 NOW WHAT THAT MEANS TO YOU IS YOU DON'T WANT HIM TO RUN WHEN THERE'S A LINE DRIVE HIT
GykPz9zF12I_5 0 AND SAY YOU SAY THAT TO HIM AGAIN AND HE DOES THE SAME THING AND THEN YOU GET ON HIM THAT'S REALLY GOING TO CONFUSE HIM AND KIND OF RUIN HIS CONFIDENCE CAUSE HE'S GOING TO THINK HE'S NOT UNDERSTANDING YOU WELL
GykPz9zF12I_6 0 ALSO YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT AS A CLEAR COMMUNICATOR YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CONSISTENT WITH YOUR SIGNS
GykPz9zF12I_7 0 YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO CHANGE THINGS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO WORK OUT VERY WELL
GykPz9zF12I_8 0 ESPECIALLY IF THE GUY HAS TO THINK AND THEN THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME OF HIS TIME AND BOOM HE'S OUT OF THE GAME
GykPz9zF12I_9 0 NOW IT ALSO GOES WITH YOUR HAND SIGNS IF YOU THROW UP THIS FOR TWO OUTS AND THEN ON THE VERY NEXT PLAY YOU DO THIS TO MEAN TWO STRIKES RIGHT AWAY YOU'VE GOT THEM CONFUSED AGAIN
GykPz9zF12I_10 0 SO REMEMBER THAT BEING A CLEAR COMMUNICATOR IS VERY IMPORTANT TO BEING A BASE COACH
hexoviyRLIM_1 0 CHRISTOPHER HOWELL HI
hexoviyRLIM_2 0 MY NAME IS CHRISTOPHER HOWELL
hexoviyRLIM_3 0 I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
hexoviyRLIM_4 0 I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE ON HOW TO USE A PELLET A.K.A
hexoviyRLIM_5 0 BB GUN ON HOW TO USE IT AND MAINTAIN IT
hexoviyRLIM_6 0 NOW WHEN I EVER USE A WEAPON IN GENERAL I ALWAYS LIKE TO KEEP TWO HANDS ON IT YOU KNOW EVEN WHEN I'M CARRYING IT AROUND
hexoviyRLIM_7 0 SOMETIMES I KEEP ONE HAND ON IT BUT YOU NEVER PUT YOUR FINGER ON THE TRIGGER NEVER EVER UNLESS YOU INTEND ON USING IT
hexoviyRLIM_8 0 SO YOU KIND OF LEAVE YOUR FINGER TO THE SIDE LEAVE YOUR FINGERS HERE CAUSE IF YOUR FINGER IS EVER ON THE TRIGGER YOU ALWAYS HAVE THAT POSSIBILITY THAT THE SAFETY MIGHT NOT BE ON OR EVEN IF IT IS ON IT MIGHT NOT BE WORKING RIGHT AND YOU COULD SHOOT SOMEBODY
hexoviyRLIM_9 0 POTENTIALLY IT COULD BE BY MISTAKE IT COULD BE SOMETHING JAMMED IN THE BARREL YOU JUST DON'T KNOW
hexoviyRLIM_10 0 SO NEVER PUT YOUR FINGER ON THE TRIGGER UNLESS YOU INTEND ON USING YOUR WEAPON
hexoviyRLIM_11 0 THIS IS CHRISTOPHER HOWELL WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE JUST COVERED ON HOW TO USE A BB GUN/PELLET GUN AND HOW TO MAINTAIN IT
gkXgkcGjUwk_1 0 WE ACTUALLY FINISH THE SALUTE IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE STARTED
gkXgkcGjUwk_2 0 YOU ARE JUST COMING BACK THE SAME THAT YOU FINISH ANY SENSE SALUTE
gkXgkcGjUwk_3 0 SO YOU COULD COME BACK REALLY STRONG OR YOU CAN COME BACK REALLY SOFT
gkXgkcGjUwk_4 0 HOWEVER HARD YOU WORKED IN THAT SUN SALUTE
gkXgkcGjUwk_5 0 HOW MANY THINGS YOU PUT IN IS GOING TO REALLY YOU KNOW SAY HOW YOU ARE GOING TO COME BACK
gkXgkcGjUwk_6 0 SO THE LAST POSITION WE DID WAS DOWN DOG
gkXgkcGjUwk_7 0 SO I AM GOING TO LET HER COME BACK AS IF SHE WAS REALLY REALLY HAD WORKED HARD AND SHE NEEDED TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK
gkXgkcGjUwk_8 0 SO WHAT SHE WOULD DO IS FOR DOWN DOG
gkXgkcGjUwk_9 0 SHE WOULD COME TO HER KNEES
gkXgkcGjUwk_10 0 STEP THE RIGHT FOOT ALL THE WAY BETWEEN THE HANDS
gkXgkcGjUwk_11 0 IF WE WOULD HAD BEEN WORKING ON THE RIGHT SIDE THAT WOULD BE AN INHALE
gkXgkcGjUwk_12 0 STEPPING THE LEFT FOOT FORWARD AN EXHALE
gkXgkcGjUwk_13 0 SHE WOULD COME BACK ALL THE WAY UP TO STANDING
gkXgkcGjUwk_14 0 INHALE AND EXHALE BACK TO ZERO
gkXgkcGjUwk_15 0 NOW IF YOU WERE STILL AT THE BEGINNING AND STILL FEELING REALLY STRONG YOU WOULD COME BACK REALLY STRONG
gp-qfDyFWKM_1 0 HI THIS IS AARON HALE AT FITNESS FOR LIFE HERE IN WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA HERE TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CALORIES THAT WE BURN ON A TREADMILL
gp-qfDyFWKM_2 0 MOST TREADMILLS HAVE A LITTLE DISPLAY THAT KIND OF GIVES YOU INFORMATION OF HOW MANY CALORIES THAT WE BURN OVER THE COURSE OF A WORKOUT ALSO HOW MANY CALORIES WE ARE BURNING PER MINUTE
gp-qfDyFWKM_3 0 THAT NUMBER IS GOING TO CHANGE GIVEN THE VALUE OF INTENSITY THAT THE WORKOUT IS
gp-qfDyFWKM_4 0 OBVIOUSLY IF WE ARE JUST GOING TO BE DOING SOME WALKING THE CALORIES THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE BURNING ESPECIALLY PER MINUTE CAN BE LESS THAN WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING IF WE WERE GOING TO BE RUNNING FOR A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME
gp-qfDyFWKM_5 0 WE CAN CHANGE EVEN THAT NUMBER BY THE INCLINE THAT WE USE WITH THE TREADMILL RAISE THE INCLINE UP TURN THE SPEED CONTROL UP
gp-qfDyFWKM_6 0 WE ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO BE BURNING MORE HIGH CALORIES AT A VERY HIGH RATE THEN IF WE WERE TO DROP IT DOWN TO ZERO INCLINE AND JUST HAVE IT AT A VERY SLOW PACE
gp-qfDyFWKM_7 0 YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE BURNING MANY CALORIES PER MINUTE BUT HEY IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING
gp-qfDyFWKM_8 0 THIS IS AARON AT FITNESS FOR LIFE HERE IN WILMINGTON TALKING ABOUT HOW TO BURN CALORIES ON A TREADMILL
gyM46ZenVQ4_1 0 OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO IN TO THE MOST IMPORTANT SHOT IN THE GAME AND THAT'S THE BREAK
gyM46ZenVQ4_2 0 I SAY IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHOEVER HAS THE BREAK ACTUALLY HAS CONTROL OF THE TABLE AT THAT POINT IN TIME
gyM46ZenVQ4_3 0 SO NOW IT STANDS TO REASON WHATEVER THEY DO WITH THE BREAK BE IT GOOD OR BAD THAT'S ON THEIR SHOULDERS
gyM46ZenVQ4_4 0 BUT WHAT THEY WANT IS SOMETHING GOOD TO HAPPEN
gyM46ZenVQ4_5 0 SO THE OBJECTIVE ON THE BREAK IS TO OF COURSE POCKET AT LEAST ONE BALL WHICH IS THEN GOING TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY AT THE TABLE AND TRY TO POCKET MORE BALLS
gyM46ZenVQ4_6 0 HOWEVER IF YOU DON'T BREAK PROPERLY AND SAY YOU SCRATCH ON THE BREAK OR YOU DON'T POCKET A BALL ALL YOU'RE DOING AT THAT POINT IS JUST TURNING CONTROL OVER THE TABLE TO YOUR OPPONENT
gyM46ZenVQ4_7 0 AND IF YOU BROKE THEM UP REALLY GOOD BUT YOU DIDN'T POCKET A BALL AND YOU TURN CONTROL OF THE TABLE OVER TO YOUR OPPONENT ALL YOU'VE DONE IS OPEN EVERYTHING UP SO THAT YOUR OPPONENT HAS AN EASY ROAD TO RUN OUT AND BEAT YOU OFF OR YOUR OWN BREAK
gyM46ZenVQ4_8 0 SO WE WANT TO LOOK REAL QUICK
gyM46ZenVQ4_9 0 WHAT MAKES A GOOD BREAK
gyM46ZenVQ4_10 0 WE WANT A CONTROL BREAK
gyM46ZenVQ4_11 0 AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT A LOT OF BEGINNING PLAYERS DO THAT REALLY IS NOT PROPER IS PUTTING THE CUE BALL TOO FAR BACK WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TOO MUCH DISTANCE TO TRAVEL FROM THAT POINT UP TO THERE
gyM46ZenVQ4_12 0 SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS PUT IT UP TO THE NEAREST LEGAL LIMIT THAT YOU CAN WHICH IS RIGHT UP ON THAT HEAD STREAM AS SO
gyM46ZenVQ4_13 0 AND THEN YOU WANT TO PUT IT SOMEWHERE AROUND THE CENTER OF THE TABLE AND YOU WANT TO MAYBE STAND WITH A LITTLE MORE UPRIGHT STANCE
gyM46ZenVQ4_14 0 BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO IS GET AS MUCH SPEED AND FOLLOW THROUGH ON THIS SHOT AS POSSIBLE
gyM46ZenVQ4_15 0 NOW WE'RE BACK TO THE LEVEL CUE RULE FOR SURE
gyM46ZenVQ4_16 0 BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS BALL COMING UP OFF THE TABLE AND WE WANT IT TO GO STRAIGHT DOWN HERE
gyM46ZenVQ4_17 0 WE DON'T WANT TO USE ANY ENGLISH TO SQUIRT THE CUE BALL OFF ONE SIDE OF THE OTHER
gyM46ZenVQ4_18 0 WE WANT TO CONTACT THAT BALL FULL AND WE WANT TO HIT IT AS FAST AS WE CAN
gyM46ZenVQ4_19 0 SO WE'RE BACK TO A VERY LONG FOLLOW THROUGH AND AS FAST A HIT AS WE CAN MAKE IT
gyM46ZenVQ4_20 0 THERE WE GO
G5OJcRrohBw_1 0 ALRIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO A LITTLE WARRIOR STUFF
G5OJcRrohBw_2 0 A LITTLE WARRIOR ACTION
G5OJcRrohBw_3 0 THIS IS WARRIOR ONE
G5OJcRrohBw_4 0 WARRIOR POSES ARE AMAZING FOR OPENING YOU UP THROUGH THE HIPS AND FOR BUILDING CONFIDENCE POISE STRENGTH AND GRACE
G5OJcRrohBw_5 0 THEY'RE POWERFUL BEAUTIFUL POSES
G5OJcRrohBw_6 0 SO WARRIOR ONE WE'RE JUST GOING TO STEP INTO IT
G5OJcRrohBw_7 0 ALL I'M GOING TO DO HERE IS I'M PLACING MY LEFT FOOT IN FRONT AND ITS POINTING FORWARD
G5OJcRrohBw_8 0 MY LEFT FOOT I MEAN MY RIGHT FOOT I'M GOING TO STEP IT BACK CHECKING THIS MID-LINE RIGHT
G5OJcRrohBw_9 0 I SHOULD BE FORTH POSITION
G5OJcRrohBw_10 0 STEP IT RIGHT BACK

GRvDiV_lFsU_9 0 THE HEIGHT OF THE SET IS JUDGED BY HOW TALL THE KING IS
GRvDiV_lFsU_10 0 THE KING SHOULD FIT TWO SQUARES WHEN YOU LAY HIM DOWN OR A ROOK ONE SQUARE WHEN YOU LAY HIM DOWN
GRvDiV_lFsU_11 0 AND THEN YOU KNOW WHEN THE RIGHT PROPORTION OF CHESS BOARD TO CHESS SET
GRvDiV_lFsU_12 0 ALTHOUGH DON'T CONSIDER THE CLASS CAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S ELONGATED AND STYLIZED DON'T COUNT THAT AS PART OF THE HEIGHT
GRvDiV_lFsU_13 0 THE SET HERE IS EBONY
GRvDiV_lFsU_14 0 EBONY IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE WOOD YOU CAN GET
GRvDiV_lFsU_15 0 IT'S THE ONLY WOOD THAT IS A NATURAL BLACK COLOR

GRvDiV_lFsU_23 0 IT'S A NATURAL BLOND COLOR

GRvDiV_lFsU_28 0 THE WEIGHT IS IN THE WOOD BUT IT'S ALSO THEY ALSO PUT LEAD IN HERE SOMETIMES OR A METAL TO WEIGH IT DOWN TO MAKE A NICE HEAVY SOUND
GRvDiV_lFsU_29 0 AND THEN PAD THE BOTTOM OF IT SO WHEN YOU PLACE THE PIECE ON THE BOARD IT WILL TOTTER BUT IT WILL STAY IN THE SQUARE THAT YOU AIMED IT FOR
GRvDiV_lFsU_30 0 WHICH IS JUST KIND OF A NICE AESTHETIC THING IT'S NOT VITAL TO THE GAME
GRvDiV_lFsU_31 0 BUT IT'S NICE TO HAVE
GRvDiV_lFsU_32 0 OTHER THE OTHER OPTION FOR CHESS SETS IS ROSE WOOD WHICH IS ANOTHER EXPENSIVE WOOD

GRvDiV_lFsU_42 0 SEE IF I CAN FIND A DIFFERENT KNIGHT HERE
GRvDiV_lFsU_43 0 IN GENERAL MOST MANUFACTURERS OF CHESS SETS HAVE A SET LOOK FOR THEIR KNIGHT
GRvDiV_lFsU_44 0 LIKE A SIGNATURE LOOK FOR HOW THEY CARVE THE TEETH AND THE EYES
GRvDiV_lFsU_45 0 SOMETIMES THEY ARE VERY INTRICATE AND DETAILED AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE STYLIZED
GRvDiV_lFsU_47 0 BUT THEY ARE STILL A GOOD CHESS SET IT'S JUST HOW THEY MANUFACTURED IT
GRvDiV_lFsU_48 0 HOW THEY DECIDED HOW THEY WANTED IT TO LOOK

hhAazpDGZ-c_1 0 DAVID A CLEMEN HI I'M DAVID CLEMEN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO PAINT A PIECE OF GLASS INSIDE OF A FRAME
hhAazpDGZ-c_2 0 OKAY SO I'VE DECIDED TO GO WITH A TREE AND I'M GOING TO PUT THE SUN IN THERE AS WELL
hhAazpDGZ-c_3 0 NOW WHEN YOU'RE PAINTING ON GLASS YOU HAVE TO KIND OF THINK IN REVERSE BECAUSE WHATEVER COLOR YOU PUT ON FIRST THAT'S GOING TO BE SEEN FIRST
hhAazpDGZ-c_4 0 AND SO YOU KINDA BUILD AND YOU ALSO HAVE TO KIND OF DRAW IN REVERSE
hhAazpDGZ-c_5 0 SO LIKE YOU CAN SEE HERE I HAD TO PUT THE BLACK DOWN FIRST AND THEN I PUT THE COLORS BACKWARDS AND VICE VERSA
hhAazpDGZ-c_6 0 YOU KNOW I CAN PUT THE BROWN HERE BUT THAT'S THE ONE THAT YOU SEE FIRST AND THEN THE BACKGROUND OF THAT I PUT THIS KIND OF MUSTARD COLOR HERE
hhAazpDGZ-c_7 0 SO YOU JUST KINDA HAVE TO THINK IN TERMS OF THE LAYERS GOING BACKWARDS VERSUS WHEN YOU PAINT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
hhAazpDGZ-c_8 0 YOU JUST KINDA PAINT AS YOU GO
hhAazpDGZ-c_9 0 SO I'M GOING TO START WITH AND WHEN YOU PAINT WITH ACRYLIC ON GLASS YOU DON'T WANT TO USE ANY WATER ON THE PAINT BECAUSE IT TENDS TO STREAK IF YOU PUT WATER ON IT AND THAT'S NOT GONNA IT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO HELP YOUR PAINTING AT ALL
hhAazpDGZ-c_10 0 SO I'M GOING TO TAKE A STIFF BRUSH AND I'M JUST GOING TO USE A LITTLE BIT OF BLACK HERE CAUSE I WANT THE OUTLINE OF THE TREE TO BE BLACK SINCE THE FRAME IS BLACK AND THE BORDER IS WHITE
hhAazpDGZ-c_11 0 SO I'M JUST GOING TO COME INTO THIS SPACE THAT I MARKED OUT AND I'M JUST GOING TO DO A REALLY SIMPLE TREE
hhAazpDGZ-c_12 0 AND YOU HAVE TO GET YOU HAVE TO TOUCH YOUR PAINT UP PRETTY OFTEN BECAUSE IF IT GETS THIN ON HERE IT'LL STREAK AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THROUGH
hhAazpDGZ-c_13 0 SO YOU KINDA HAVE TO REAPPLY MORE OFTEN THAN WHEN YOU'RE PAINTING
hhAazpDGZ-c_14 0 BUT IT'S A SMOOTH SURFACE AND IT FLOWS ON THERE QUITE NICELY
hhAazpDGZ-c_15 0 AND I ACTUALLY NEED MORE PAINT
hhAazpDGZ-c_16 0 AND WE'LL CONTINUE THIS IN THE NEXT SEGMENT
hBP9dx2202c_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE ARE GOING TO DRILL OUR PILOT HOLE IN THE CENTER OF THE BOWL WHICH IS GOING TO GIVE US THE DEPTH THAT WE WANT TO GO TO SO THAT WE DON'T CUT RIGHT THROUGH THE BOTTOM
hBP9dx2202c_2 0 SO IN ORDER TO GET THE PROPER DEPTH WE WANT TO MEASURE THE DIAMETER OF THE BOWL AND FOR THIS I'VE GOT A TAPE MEASURE AND IT IS ABOUT A NINE AND 1/2 INCH DEPTH OUR OUTSIDE DIAMETER AND THEN WE WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT OUR DEPTH IS AND FOR THAT WE USE A RULER ON THE VERY BACK OF THE BOWL AND THEN PUT A TAPE MEASURE FLAT UP AGAINST IT AND THAT TELLS US WE HAVE ROUGHLY ABOUT TWO AND 3/4 OF DEPTH
hBP9dx2202c_3 0 NOW WHEN YOU ARE TURNING A ROUGH BOWL OUT OF GREEN WOOD WE KNOW THAT THE BOWL IS GOING TO WARP OUT OF SHAPE WHEN IT DRIES AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO LEAVE SOME WALL THICKNESS SO THAT THERE IS ENOUGH WOOD LEFT WHEN IT IS DRY TO TURN A SECOND TIME
hBP9dx2202c_4 0 AND THE GENERAL RULE IS YOU WANT TO LEAVE TEN %PERCENT WALL THICKNESS PER OUTSIDE DIAMETER OF THE BOWL
hBP9dx2202c_5 0 SO A TEN INCH WALL OR A TEN INCH DIAMETER BOWL YOU WOULD WANT TO LEAVE ABOUT A ONE INCH WALL THICKNESS
hBP9dx2202c_6 0 NOW THERE IS IT IS NOT REALLY HARD AND FAST BUT THAT IS THE GENERAL RULE THAT YOU CAN LIVE BY

hK5gvYN1XyY_17 0 SO JUST PUT A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME AND TASTE IT UNTIL IT IS THE RIGHT TASTE THAT YOU WANT IT TO BE
hK5gvYN1XyY_18 0 SO GO AHEAD AND GRAB YOUR PEPPER AND JUST PUT A LITTLE BIT IN THERE NOT TOO MUCH WE DON'T WANT THIS TO OVERWHELM THE TASTE AND THEN DO THE SAME THING WITH THE SALT
hK5gvYN1XyY_19 0 YOU JUST WANT TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF THE SALT IN THERE AND ONCE AGAIN THIS IS JUST FOR SEASONING

HH5T1nwtw1I_1 0 I'M BEAU TIMKEN MASTER SAKE SOMMELIER AND IN THIS SEGMENT ON JUNMAI SAKE I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT SOME DIFFERENT NAMESNOT BREWS SPECIFICALLY BUT DIFFERENT SORT OF SUBSETS OR SUBCATEGORIES TO THE CATEGORY OF JUNMAI SAKE
HH5T1nwtw1I_2 0 NOW OF ALL THE FERMENTED BEVERAGES SAKE HAS THE NATURALLY HIGHEST OCCURRING ALCOHOL CONTENT
HH5T1nwtw1I_3 0 THE YEAST WILL ACTUALLY LET THE BREW GO UP TO ABOUT EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY %PERCENT ALCOHOL NATURALLY
HH5T1nwtw1I_4 0 TYPICALLY DON'T THINK SUPER BOOZY
HH5T1nwtw1I_5 0 THEY WILL BRING THAT LEVEL DOWN BACK TO BY ADDING WATER TO ABOUT FIFTEEN %PERCENT
HH5T1nwtw1I_6 0 WHERE BEER YEASTS DIES AT ABOUT 8-1/2 %PERCENT WHERE WINE YEASTS KICK AT ABOUT THIRTEEN FOURTEEN %PERCENT THE YEAST OF SAKE WILL ALLOW IT TO GO UP TO ABOUT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY %PERCENT
HH5T1nwtw1I_7 0 NOW BREWERS SOMETIMES WILL RELEASE THE SAKE IN THAT FORM
HH5T1nwtw1I_8 0 IT'S CALLED GINJO UNDILUTED SAKE
HH5T1nwtw1I_9 0 THEY DON'T DILUTE IT
HH5T1nwtw1I_10 0 NOW YOU'LL SEE A JUNMAI A JUNMAI GINJO
HH5T1nwtw1I_11 0 GIVE IT A TRY SOME TIME BIGGER FULL-BODY REALLY RANGY LONG DEEP LEGS GOOD BREW
HH5T1nwtw1I_12 0 THERE'S ANOTHER SUBCATEGORY CALLED A YAHAMAHAI OR THE KIMOTO
HH5T1nwtw1I_13 0 THESE ARE THE TWO TRADITIONAL METHODS WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO NOT ADD LACTIC ACID IN THE MIX BUT ALLOWING KIND OF WILD GAMY YEAST TO KIND OF PROPAGATE AND GIVE IT THE DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT MORE FULL-BODIED EARTHIER SOME PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE KIND OF MORE MEATY FLAVOR
HH5T1nwtw1I_14 0 NOW DON'T THINK THAT SAKE'S MADE JUST BY USING RAFTER YEASTS
HH5T1nwtw1I_15 0 NO THEY'LL ADD A DIFFERENT YEAST TO GET UP TO THOSE ALCOHOL CONTENT LEVELS
HH5T1nwtw1I_16 0 BUT TRADITIONAL YAHAMAHAI AND TRADITIONAL KIMOTO METHOD WHICH IS A POLE RAM METHOD WHERE THEY USED TO LITERALLY BEAT PULVERIZE IN A TUB USING LONG PADDLES THIS RICE STEAMED RICE TO TRY TO PROMOTE LACTIC ACID WHICH THEY DIDN'T KNOW REALLY KIND OF OCCURRED BY ITSELF IN ANY CASE
HH5T1nwtw1I_17 0 AND THEN EVENTUALLY THEY WENT TO A METHOD WHERE YOU JUST ADD LACTIC ACID
HH5T1nwtw1I_18 0 BUT THESE ARE TWO ROMANTIC STYLES THAT THEY STILL MAKE THEM THAT WAY
HH5T1nwtw1I_19 0 WHY WOULD THEY GO THROUGH THE EFFORT
HH5T1nwtw1I_20 0 BECAUSE THE END RESULT IS SUPERB IT MAKES A DIFFERENT STYLE DIFFERENT FLAVOR BREW ALTOGETHER
HH5T1nwtw1I_21 0 AND IF YOU'VE NEVER TRIED ONE I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND TRYING EITHER A KIMOTO OR A YAHAMAHAI STYLE SAKE AND AGAIN YOU'LL NOTICE A DIFFERENCE IN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT REGARDS

H_DbUmviqck_1 0 ALRIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE ADLIB TRACKS
H_DbUmviqck_2 0 WHEN YOU RECORD YOU SHOULD PROBABLY RECORD AT LEAST TWO TO THREE ADLIB TRACKS UNDERNEATH YOUR VERSES
H_DbUmviqck_3 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU HAVE YOUR VERSE MIX
H_DbUmviqck_4 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS THEN BEGIN TO PAN
H_DbUmviqck_5 0 IF YOU HAVE TWO ADLIB TRACKS YOU CAN BEGIN TO PAN ONE TO THE LEFT ONE TO THE RIGHT
H_DbUmviqck_6 0 IF YOU THREE IT'S BEST TO LISTEN TO ALL THREE OF THEM AND FIND OUT THE BEST TWO
H_DbUmviqck_7 0 MUTE ONE AND JUST USE TWO OF THEM AND YOU WANT TO PAN THAT TO THE LEFT AND TO THE RIGHT
H_DbUmviqck_8 0 WHAT THAT DOES IT GIVES YOUR VOCALS A REAL REAL GOOD FULL SOUND ON YOUR VERSES WHEN YOU SAY CERTAIN WORDS
H_DbUmviqck_9 0 SO YOU MAY THE ADLIB TRACKS USUALLY YOU SHOULD JUST BE HYPING UP CERTAIN WORDS OR SAYING REPEATING CERTAIN WORDS
H_DbUmviqck_10 0 IT GIVES IT A REAL GOOD FULL SOUND AND THEN YOU WHEN YOU PAN IT TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT IT REALLY EMPHASIZES THE WORDS THAT YOU'RE SAYING
H_DbUmviqck_11 0 SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS MIX YOUR ADLIB TRACKS AFTER YOU'RE DONE MIXING YOUR VERSE
H_DbUmviqck_12 0 AFTER YOU ADD YOUR COMPRESSION IN IT
H_DbUmviqck_13 0 TAKE YOUR ADLIBS TRACKS
H_DbUmviqck_14 0 I ALWAYS SAY START OFF LOW
H_DbUmviqck_15 0 START THEM OFF LOW AND BEGIN TO JUST TURN IT UP
H_DbUmviqck_16 0 CONTINUE TO JUST TURN THEM ADLIB TRACKS UP LITTLE BY LITTLE UNTIL YOU GET THE SOUND THAT YOU WANT
H_DbUmviqck_17 0 ONCE YOU GET THE ADLIBS RIGHT WHERE YOU WANT THEM TO BE THEN EVERYTHING IS GOOD
H_DbUmviqck_18 0 THEN YOU BEGIN TO TURN THE BEAT BACK ON
H_DbUmviqck_19 0 LIKE I SAID BEFORE WHEN YOU'RE MIXING YOUR VOCALS YOU WANT TO HAVE THE BEAT MUTED
H_DbUmviqck_20 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE NO MUSIC PLAYING
H_DbUmviqck_21 0 YOU MIX YOUR VOCALS
H_DbUmviqck_22 0 YOU MIX YOUR ADLIB TRACK WITH YOUR VOCALS
H_DbUmviqck_23 0 GET INTO A NICE CRISP SOUND THAT YOU LIKE AND THEN YOU TURN YOUR BEAT BACK ON THEN YOU KIND OF MIX THEM ALL TOGETHER
H_DbUmviqck_24 0 KIND OF JUST TAKE THOSE THREE LITTLE TRACKS THAT YOU MIXED TOGETHER AND TURN THEM ALL UP AT THE SAME TIME AND YOU'LL HAVE A REAL GOOD MIX WITH YOUR ADLIBS YOUR VOCALS AND THE REST OF THE BEAT
hhGh_JV4bT8_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO START TAKING A LOOK AT HOW TO COLLECT AND USE NATURALLY OCCURRING CLAY
hhGh_JV4bT8_2 0 THAT'S CLAY THAT COMES STRAIGHT OUT OF THE GROUND
hhGh_JV4bT8_3 0 NOW UP TO THIS POINT WE'VE LOOKED AT HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN CLAY BODY BASED ON HIGHLY PROCESSED INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS BUT BECAUSE CLAY IS A NATURALLY OCCURRING SUBSTANCE AND IT EXISTS RIGHT IN THE GROUND WE CAN DIG IT OUT OF THE GROUND AND USE IT AS IS
hhGh_JV4bT8_4 0 NOW REMEMBER THAT IT'S A SEDIMENTARY MATERIAL SO STREAM BEDS AND LAKE BEDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHERE THE MATERIAL COLLECTS WHEN THE EROSION OCCURS ARE GOOD PLACES TO START LOOKING
hhGh_JV4bT8_5 0 DEPENDING ON WHAT PART OF THE COUNTRY YOU'RE IN YOU MAY HAVE TONS OF CLAY ALL AROUND YOU AND MAYBE RIGHT UNDER YOUR GRASS IN YOUR FRONT YARD JUST UNDER THE TOPSOIL OR YOU MAY HAVE TO DIG A LITTLE DEEPER OR YOU MAY NOT HAVE ANY AT ALL BUT SUFFICED TO SAY THAT STREAM BEDS AND LAKE BEDS ARE GOOD PLACES TO START LOOKING WHICH IS WHY I'VE IDENTIFIED THIS AREA HERE BECAUSE THIS STREAM CUT HAS LESS TOPSOIL IN IT ALREADY IT'S GOT THE BANK IS KIND OF CUT SO I CAN START DIGGING RIGHT HERE AND SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND
hhGh_JV4bT8_6 0 OK I FOUND SOME CLAY
hhGh_JV4bT8_7 0 I DIDN'T HAVE TO DIG TOO DEEP
hhGh_JV4bT8_8 0 AS YOU CAN SEE HOPEFULLY YOU CAN SEE THIS IT LOOKS LIKE STRATA LIKE LAYERS
hhGh_JV4bT8_9 0 IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN A PICTURE OF THE GRAND CANYON FOR INSTANCE THEN YOU KNOW WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE
hhGh_JV4bT8_10 0 THE SEDIMENTARY MATERIAL THAT COLLECTED OVER TIME AND THAT'S JUST WHAT THIS IS SO
hhGh_JV4bT8_11 0 BUT IT'S GOT A DIFFERENT COLORATION TO IT AND IT'S GOT THAT STICKY PLASTIC KIND OF FEEL THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR OUT OF A CLAY BODY SO
hhGh_JV4bT8_12 0 THERE'S A LOT OF ORGANIC MATTER HERE
hhGh_JV4bT8_13 0 LEAVES AND TWIGS AND I HAD TO CUT THROUGH A BUNCH OF ROOTS AND THINGS TO GET DOWN IN HERE SO
hhGh_JV4bT8_14 0 I'M GOING TO TRY AND AVOID AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE GETTING THAT EXTRANEOUS CRAP INTO THE CLAY SO I HAVE LESS TO CLEAN OUT BUT IT'S KIND OF INEVITABLE AND THEN AFTER I DIG SOME OF THIS OUT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO CLEAN OUT THAT EXTRANEOUS MATERIAL AND PREPARE IT FOR TESTING AND USE IN YOUR CERAMIC WORK
g4ELdKhdOWQ_1 0 NOW LET'S TAKE OUR FOLKLORIC EGYPTIAN WALK ADD THE HOP TO IT AND THEN TRAVEL FORWARD AND BACK
g4ELdKhdOWQ_2 0 WE MIGHT THROW IN A LITTLE ARM VARIATION AS WELL
g4ELdKhdOWQ_3 0 LET'S START WITH OUR BASIC
g4ELdKhdOWQ_4 0 STEP AND HIP STEP AND HIP
g4ELdKhdOWQ_5 0 WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUR ARMS UP HERE IN A HIGH IBIS ARM
g4ELdKhdOWQ_6 0 STEP AND HIP
g4ELdKhdOWQ_7 0 WE'RE NOW WE'RE BOUNCING STEP AND HIP LITTLE JUMP SIDE
g4ELdKhdOWQ_8 0 JUST LITTLE FASTER IT'S HARD TO DO IT SLOW
g4ELdKhdOWQ_9 0 STEP LIFT STEP HIP STEP HIP STEP HIP
g4ELdKhdOWQ_11 0 AND LET'S TAKE IT STEP TOUCH STEP TOUCH
g4ELdKhdOWQ_12 0 SO YOU'RE KIND OF JUMPING FROM ONE STEP TO THE NEXT
g4ELdKhdOWQ_13 0 BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE BOUNCING DURING YOUR HIP LIFT
g4ELdKhdOWQ_14 0 YOU WANT TO BOUNCE AND THEN STAY IN PLACE
g4ELdKhdOWQ_15 0 STEP HIP STEP HIP STEP HIP
g4ELdKhdOWQ_16 0 SO A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT IS OKAY BUT YOU DON'T WANT A WHOLE LOT OF EXTRA MOVEMENT
g4ELdKhdOWQ_18 0 SO LET'S CHANGE THE ARMS
g4ELdKhdOWQ_19 0 LET'S DO A SAIIDI ARM BY YOUR HEAD AND THEN SWITCH
g4ELdKhdOWQ_20 0 FORWARD STEP STEP
g4ELdKhdOWQ_22 0 STEP HIP STEP HIP
g4ELdKhdOWQ_23 0 KEEP THE ELBOW BACK
g4ELdKhdOWQ_24 0 KEEP THE ARM RELAXED
g4ELdKhdOWQ_25 0 SO AGAIN WHEN THE HIP GOES UP EVERYTHING'S STATIONARY
g4ELdKhdOWQ_26 0 YOUR ARMS OUT AND THEN IN PLACE AND YOUR NICE AND LOW
g4ELdKhdOWQ_27 0 SO JUST THE HIP MOVEMENT SHOWS
gKDwtAmDGl8_1 0 IF YOU WANT TO LIVE A LONG HEALTHY LIFE THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT ARE KIND OF WORKING AGAINST US FROM A SOCIETAL PERSPECTIVE
gKDwtAmDGl8_2 0 AND ONE OF THOSE IS THAT SOCIETY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES HAS BEEN SUPERSIZED IN PROPORTIONS AND IT HAPPENED SLOWLY AND OVER TIME SO IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY THINK ABOUT ON A DAILY BASIS
gKDwtAmDGl8_3 0 BUT IF YOU WENT BACK THIRTY YEARS AGO AND TOOK AN IDENTICAL RECIPE AND COMPARED IT WITH THE RECIPE TODAY TODAY IT WOULD SAY THAT IT SERVED LESS PEOPLE BUT IT IS THE SAME RECIPE AND THE SAME AMOUNT OF FOOD AND THAT IS BECAUSE OVERALL WE'VE INCREASED OUR PORTIONS
gKDwtAmDGl8_4 0 IF YOU LOOK AT THE OBESITY EPIDEMIC IN THE US AND THE KIND OF HEALTH CONCERNS THAT OBESITY BRINGS ALONG WITH IT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT QUITE A SERIOUS ISSUE AND THERE ARE A FEW SIMPLE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO KIND OF TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR OWN PORTION CONTROL
gKDwtAmDGl8_5 0 FIRST OF ALL DON'T RELY ON PACKAGING LABELS AND COOK BOOKS TO TELL YOU WHAT A PORTION IS
gKDwtAmDGl8_6 0 YOU KNOW YOUR OWN BODY AND YOU CAN DECIDE FOR YOURSELF WHAT A GOOD PORTION IS AND FOR THE MOST PART IT IS A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN THE RESTAURANTS AND THE COOK BOOKS SAY THAT IT IS
gKDwtAmDGl8_7 0 IF YOU'RE A SMALLER PERSON THEN YOU MIGHT NEED A SMALLER PORTION TO GO ALONG WITH YOUR SIZE
gKDwtAmDGl8_8 0 IF YOU ARE EATING OUT FOR EXAMPLE I WOULD RECOMMEND HALVING THE PLATE THAT IS BROUGHT TO YOU AND SAVING THE OTHER HALF FOR ANOTHER MEAL
gKDwtAmDGl8_9 0 A LOT OF TIMES THE PORTIONS THAT YOU GET ARE RIDICULOUS AND THEY'RE MUCH TOO BIG FOR A SINGLE MEAL BUT UNFORTUNATELY AMERICANS HAVE GOTTEN IN THE HABIT OF THINKING THAT IF THEY SAY THAT IS A SERVING THAT MUST BE A SERVING SO I'M GOING TO EAT IT ALL
gKDwtAmDGl8_10 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO EAT IT ALL JUST BECAUSE IT IS BROUGHT TO YOU
gEufIL3Czzk_1 0 OKAY NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON A BIT OF A DIFFERENT TECHNIQUE AND THIS IS A LOT MORE INVOLVED ESPECIALLY WITH THE PERSON YOU'RE WORKING ON
gEufIL3Czzk_2 0 YOU'RE GOING TO ELEVATE THEIR HEAD AND YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE WHICHEVER HAND WE'LL USE THE LEFT FOR RIGHT NOW
gEufIL3Czzk_3 0 AND WE'RE GOING BACK ALONG THOSE ORIGINAL LINES
gEufIL3Czzk_4 0 NOW AS YOU CAN SEE FROM ERIC'S FACE THAT DIDN'T FEEL TOO GOOD
gEufIL3Czzk_5 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OUT WHERE THE SOURCE OF THE TROUBLE IS YOU'RE GOING TO ASK IS THE PAIN GOING UP OR DOWN
gEufIL3Czzk_8 0 NOW YOU'RE GOING TO MANIPULATE THE HEAD IN SUCH A WAY YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE YOUR THUMB WHERE IT IS AND ELEVATE THE HEAD SLIGHTLY
gEufIL3Czzk_9 0 UP DOWN OR BETTER
gEufIL3Czzk_10 0 A LITTLE BIT DOWN
gEufIL3Czzk_11 0 A LITTLE DOWN OKAY
gEufIL3Czzk_12 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY HUNT FOR THE BEST POSITION
gEufIL3Czzk_13 0 SO IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO MOVE HIS HEAD TO THE RIGHT
gEufIL3Czzk_14 0 WORSE BETTER ABOUT THE SAME
gEufIL3Czzk_15 0 A LITTLE BETTER
gEufIL3Czzk_16 0 OKAY SO WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK
gEufIL3Czzk_17 0 MOVE IT FURTHER OUT
gEufIL3Czzk_18 0 THAT'S NOT TOO BAD
gEufIL3Czzk_19 0 OKAY A LITTLE FURTHER UP
gEufIL3Czzk_20 0 NOW RELAX ALL OF YOUR WEIGHT IN MY HANDS
gEufIL3Czzk_21 0 I'LL HOLD YOUR HEAD UP
gEufIL3Czzk_22 0 IT'S ABOUT THE SAME AS THE LAST ONE
gEufIL3Czzk_23 0 OKAY GO A LITTLE BIT FORWARD
gEufIL3Czzk_24 0 THAT'S JUST PERFECT
gEufIL3Czzk_25 0 OKAY PERFECT WE LEAVE OUR HAND RIGHT THERE
gEufIL3Czzk_26 0 WE EXTEND KEY INTO THAT AREA AND WE MAKE SURE WE FOCUS WELL
gEufIL3Czzk_27 0 MAKE SURE THE PERSON IS RELAXING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
gEufIL3Czzk_28 0 AND AS THEY DO YOU LET THEM RELAX AND ONCE YOU FEEL TENSION LIGHTEN UP UNDERNEATH YOU GOING TO LET THAT PERSON RELAX AND YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE THEIR HEAD BACK INTO POSITION AND YOU'RE GOING TO MAINTAIN THAT SAME PRESSURE IN THAT SAME SPOT AS YOU HOLD THAT HEAD UP
_H3cEyCU1FM_1 0 HELLO I AM MARK SIEBEL OWNER AND LEAD TRAINER OF DOGGIE STEPS DOG TRAINING
_H3cEyCU1FM_2 0 IN THIS NEXT SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT AGILITY AND THE TUNNEL OBSTACLE
_H3cEyCU1FM_3 0 THE ORIGIN AND THEORY OF THE TUNNEL IS AN EXERCISE WHICH REQUIRES THE DOG TO GO THROUGH A CONFINED SPACE
_H3cEyCU1FM_4 0 TUNNELS ON AVERAGE ARE ANYWHERE BETWEEN TEN TO THIRTY FEET LONG AND TWO FEET WIDE
_H3cEyCU1FM_5 0 YOU CAN SEE THE TUNNEL BEHIND ME
_H3cEyCU1FM_6 0 FOR MOST DOGS AT FIRST IT IS A VERY CONSTRICTIVE EXERCISE OBSTACLE BUT WITH PRACTICE ROUTINE AND REPETITION THE DOG WILL MASTER THIS EXERCISE
_H3cEyCU1FM_7 0 AS FAR AS LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY THE TUNNEL WILL RATE A MORE DIFFICULT EXERCISE BASED ON THE CONSTRICTIVE NATURE OF THE DOG HAVING TO GO THROUGH A CONFINED SPACE
_H3cEyCU1FM_8 0 THE GOAL OF THE TUNNEL WILL BE TO HAVE YOUR DOG BE BALANCED WITH SPEED AND MOVEMENT TO GET THROUGH THE TUNNEL AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
_H3cEyCU1FM_9 0 IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO LINE THE DOG UP FROM THE PREVIOUS AND POST OBSTACLES TO ENSURE THEY HAVE A CLEAR RUN THROUGH
gZvUB6APsx0_1 0 HI THIS IS LIZ MULLER FROM LIZ'S HAIR DESIGN IN HOLLYWOOD FLORIDA
gZvUB6APsx0_2 0 IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO WRAP ETHNIC HAIR
gZvUB6APsx0_3 0 SO OF COURSE MIA WHEN SHE GETS HOME I WANT HER TO WRAP THIS HAIR BUT BEFORE SHE LEAVES SOMETIMES I WRAP IT
gZvUB6APsx0_4 0 AND LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE WRAPPING HAIR OKAY THE DIRECTION THAT THE HAIR IN WHICH YOU DO
gZvUB6APsx0_5 0 YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE THE HAIR BREAK IT UP IN HALF LIKE HALF THIS WAY HALF THE OTHER WAY
gZvUB6APsx0_7 0 YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND PUSH THIS BACK A LITTLE BIT
gZvUB6APsx0_8 0 AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PROCEED TO GO AROUND LIKE THIS HALF THE HEAD FROM THE EAR TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEAD THIS WAY
gZvUB6APsx0_10 0 NOW FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT YOU KNOW STEADY AND HAVE FEAR OF JUST LOSING ALL THE HAIR YOU CAN CLIP IT RIGHT BY THE EAR RIGHT HERE
gZvUB6APsx0_12 0 THEN YOU TAKE THE OTHER PART OF THE HAIR BY HOLDING YOUR HAND HERE OKAY AND IF YOU WERE AT HOME YOU'D HOLD IT HERE AND YOU'D TRY TO GET IT AROUND THIS IS REALLY DIFFICULT BUT YOU TRY YOUR BEST
gZvUB6APsx0_13 0 BUT IF BEAUTICIAN'S DOING IT SHE CAN JUST GO AROUND THE HAIR LIKE THIS HOLDING IT HERE ALSO BRINGING IT AROUND AND JUST IT'S VERY SOFT YOU KNOW AFTER IT GETS DONE SO YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE YOUR TIME TAKE YOUR TIME
gZvUB6APsx0_14 0 SOMETIMES I HAVE TO GO AHEAD AND REDO IT AGAIN OKAY AND IT DRIVES ME NUTS CAUSE IT'S DROPPING
gZvUB6APsx0_15 0 BUT IF THE HAIR IS NICE AND SOFT YOU JUST YOU KNOW PLAY WITH IT TAKE YOUR TIME DON'T GET STRESSED OUT
gZvUB6APsx0_16 0 IF YOU'RE AT HOME JUST AGAIN TRY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
gZvUB6APsx0_17 0 YOU JUST WANT TO CONTINUE TO WRAP THE HAIR LIKE THIS AND YOU PUT ANOTHER CLIP HERE OKAY AND YOU SMOOTH IT OUT BY USING A FLAT BRUSH
gZvUB6APsx0_18 0 YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE A FLAT BRUSH AND SMOOTH IT OUT LIKE THIS AND THEN YOU HAVE TO JUST SMOOTH OUT THE ENDS AND THEN PUT THE HAIRNET AROUND IT AND YOU'RE DONE
H7kbHukjb60_1 0 SO YOU CAN'T TAKE CARE OF YOUR FISH ANYMORE YOU NEED TO LEAVE YOU'RE MOVING OUT OF TOWN DON'T TAKE YOUR FISH DOWN TO THE NEAREST RIVER OR CREEK
H7kbHukjb60_2 0 YOU MAY THINK YOU'RE DOING THE FISH A FAVOR GIVING THEM A NICE BIG HOME BUT IN REALITY YOU COULD ACTUALLY BE HURTING THE ECO SYSTEM OF THAT AREA
H7kbHukjb60_3 0 I'M BRUCE WITH AQUATEK TROPICAL IN AUSTIN TEXAS
H7kbHukjb60_4 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR FISH WHEN YOU CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THEM ANYMORE
H7kbHukjb60_5 0 THE BEST THING TO DO IF YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND THAT KEEPS FISH ASK THEM IF THEY CAN TAKE THEM
H7kbHukjb60_6 0 IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS WHO ARE KEEPING FISH TAKE THEM BACK TO THE STORE WHERE YOU GOT THEM FROM
H7kbHukjb60_7 0 CHANCES ARE THEY WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE THEM OFF YOUR HANDS AND MAY ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A LITTLE MONEY BACK
H7kbHukjb60_8 0 PROBABLY NOT AS MUCH AS YOU SPENT ON THEM BUT EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS
H7kbHukjb60_9 0 THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO IS JUST DUMPING YOUR FISH IN THE NEAREST CREEK
H7kbHukjb60_10 0 ALL THAT REALLY ACCOMPLISHES IS INTRODUCING A SPECIES TO THAT RIVER SYSTEM THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE
H7kbHukjb60_11 0 MAYBE IT WILL DIE TEMPERATURE WON'T BE RIGHT WATER CONDITIONS WON'T BE RIGHT BUT MAYBE IT WILL LIVE MAYBE IT WILL THRIVE MAYBE IT WILL BECOME THE SNAKE HEADS OF MARYLAND
H7kbHukjb60_12 0 YOU HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR THESE KIND OF THINGS
H7kbHukjb60_13 0 SO THAT'S THE PROPER WAY TO RE-HOME YOUR FISH
H7kbHukjb60_14 0 UNTIL NEXT TIME I'M BRUCE WITH AQUATEK
HhlWUEbHBUk_1 0 THE DRINK WE ARE ABOUT TO MAKE IS CALLED A BICARDI VOLCANO
HhlWUEbHBUk_2 0 THE FIRST THING WE'LL DO IS PUT SOME ICE IN A GLASS HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO DO BELIEVE IT OR NOT A HALF A GLASS OF 151
HhlWUEbHBUk_3 0 SO FILL THAT UP AND THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH 151 TO REALLY SET OFF A VOLCANO AND WE'LL MIX IN HALF A GLASS OF COLA AND LET'S GO AHEAD AND MIX THIS UP HERE AND ALSO DO THE JUICE OF HALF OF A LIME SO IF YOU JUST GRAB A FEW LIME WEDGES AND SQUEEZE THOSE IN
HhlWUEbHBUk_4 0 JUST GO AHEAD AND THROW THE WHOLE WEDGE IN THERE
HhlWUEbHBUk_5 0 THERE WE GO AND MIX THAT UP AND THE LAST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS GO AHEAD AND POUR THIS IN A GLASS AND WE ARE GOING TO FLAT SOME EVERCLEAR ON TOP WHICH IS GOING TO BE AT LEAST 151 PROOF AND CAN GO ALL THE WAY UP TO 180 PROOF SO IF YOU FLOAT THAT ON TOP A FULL SHOT AND WHAT IS GREAT ABOUT THIS IS IF YOU WANT YOU CAN LIGHT THAT ON FIRE AND THEN FIND SOME WAY OF DRINKING IT
HhlWUEbHBUk_6 0 THAT'S A BICARDI VOLCANO BOTTOMS UP
GwCV7S-_LQY_1 0 IN THIS STEP WE WILL BE PUTTING THE BINDING ON
GwCV7S-_LQY_2 0 HOWEVER THE FIRST STEP IN THE BINDING PROCESS WOULD BE TO EVEN UP THE EDGES OF YOUR QUILT
GwCV7S-_LQY_3 0 SO WITH A ROTARY CUTTER AND YOUR CUTTING MAT AND YOUR RULER YOU WOULD EVEN ALL THE EDGES OF THE QUILT
GwCV7S-_LQY_4 0 THE NEXT STEP IN THE PROCESS WOULD BE ACTUALLY MEASURING YOUR QUILT SO YOU GET THE CORRECT LENGTH OF THE BINDING
GwCV7S-_LQY_5 0 NOW DEPENDING ON HOW YOUR SEW MAY DEPEND ON THE SIZE OF THE QUILT
GwCV7S-_LQY_6 0 IN THE CASE OF OUR LITTLE FOUR PATCH THAT WE DID HERE ITS THIRTEEN X 25
GwCV7S-_LQY_7 0 THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO FIGURE THE LENGTH OF YOUR BINDING
GwCV7S-_LQY_8 0 NOW THE WIDTH OF THE QUILT AND THE LENGTH OF THE QUILT IF THEY ARE THE SAME IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH SIDE THAT YOU PICK
GwCV7S-_LQY_9 0 BUT IN THE CASE OF MY SMALL PIECE I HAVE HERE I HAVE ONE SIDE THAT IS THIRTEEN INCHES AND ONE SIDE THAT IS 25 INCHES
GwCV7S-_LQY_10 0 SO WE WILL CUT TWO PIECES OF BINDING THAT ARE 25 INCHES LONG BY FIVE INCHES WIDE
GwCV7S-_LQY_11 0 AND THEN TWO PIECES BINDING THAT ARE FIFTEEN INCHES LONG BY FIVE INCHES WIDE
GwCV7S-_LQY_12 0 THE REASON THAT THEY WOULD BE FIFTEEN INCHES IS BECAUSE WE NEED TO EXTEND AN EXTRA TWO INCHES ON EITHER SIDE TO CONNECT WITH THE CROSSWISE BINDING
GwCV7S-_LQY_13 0 ONCE YOU'VE CUT THE BINDING AND THE FILLER YOU ACTUALLY NEED THE SAME SIZE FILLER AS YOU RE BINDING JUST PLACE THAT ON THE INSIDE AND PRESS IT
GwCV7S-_LQY_14 0 AND NOW YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO FOLD YOUR BINDING IN HALF
GwCV7S-_LQY_15 0 AND WE ARE GOING TO PRESS IT SO WE HAVE A NICE EVEN PIECE OF BINDING ALL THE WAY ALONG HERE
hjqEo6E6H4w_1 0 OKAY INTERVIEWING BROKERS
hjqEo6E6H4w_2 0 EVERYBODY IS GONNA WANT YOU
hjqEo6E6H4w_3 0 EVERYBODY WANTS YOU
hjqEo6E6H4w_4 0 IT'S A NUMBERS GAME
hjqEo6E6H4w_5 0 THERE MIGHT BE FORTY PEOPLE THAT HAVE TAKEN A CLASS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THE INSTRUCTORS MIGHT SAY TO YA AND AGAIN I'M NOT HERE TO DISCOURAGE I'M HERE TO INSPIRE BECAUSE I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT
hjqEo6E6H4w_6 0 BUT ONE OF THOSE THINGS THOSE INSTRUCTORS MIGHT HAVE SAID TO YOU IS OUT OF ABOUT THIRTY OF YA OUT THERE RIGHT NOW THERE MIGHT BE THREE THAT END UP BEING GREAT REALTORS
hjqEo6E6H4w_7 0 WELL THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE
hjqEo6E6H4w_8 0 BUT YOU KNOW THE KEY IS SELECTING THAT BROKER IS HUGE
hjqEo6E6H4w_9 0 IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO FIND THE RIGHT BROKER
hjqEo6E6H4w_10 0 SO WHY DON'T YOU DO THIS WHY DON'T YOU START THINKIN ABOUT THE THE SUCCESSFUL REALTORS THAT YOU'VE SEEN THE NAMES ON SIGNS MAYBE THE PERSON THAT HELPED YOU BUY THEIR HOME MAYBE THE TOP BROKERS MAYBE NOT
hjqEo6E6H4w_11 0 I MEAN THERE MIGHT BE A BROKER NAMED KAREN JACKSON PROPERTIES AND THERE SHE IS JACKSON PROPERTIES
hjqEo6E6H4w_12 0 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A HUGE BROKER
hjqEo6E6H4w_13 0 WHAT THE THE BROKER THAT I CHOSE I CHOSE BASED ON A NUMBER OF REASONS AND IT'S VERY INTERESTING
hjqEo6E6H4w_14 0 I DID MY DUE DILIGENCE I'M A RESEARCHER BY NATURE
hjqEo6E6H4w_15 0 AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY I CHOSE THE BROKER I CHOOSE
G6iHQkic6Ug_1 0 HERE IS A DRESS THAT I'M WEARING IT'S SLIGHTLY BELOW ABOVE MY KNEE
G6iHQkic6Ug_2 0 AND IT GOES VERY WELL WITH THESE BOOTS WITH THE KNEE HIGHS BOOTS
G6iHQkic6Ug_3 0 WHICH CAN BE FLIPPED OR CAN BE WORN UP
G6iHQkic6Ug_4 0 IF I WANT TO SHOW MORE OF MY LEGS AND OF COURSE I'LL GO WITH THESE BOOTS I'LL BRING THEM DOWN JUST LIKE THAT
G6iHQkic6Ug_5 0 IF I'M NOT SHY ABOUT MY TALL LEGS THIS IS HOW I WOULD WEAR IT
G6iHQkic6Ug_6 0 HOWEVER I COULD HAVE A VARIATION AND OF COURSE NOT BEING SHY ABOUT MY LEGS I CAN WEAR IT UP
G6iHQkic6Ug_7 0 JUST TO ADD SOME STYLE TO IT
G6iHQkic6Ug_8 0 ALSO THIS DRESS IS A VERY WELL FIT WITH THESE PARTICULAR SHOES OR WITH THIS TYPE OF SHOES OR ANY KIND OF SHOES WHICH HAVE A LITTLE HEEL
G6iHQkic6Ug_9 0 SO YOU CAN'T GO WRONG IF YOU WEAR A SHORTER DRESS AS A TALL WOMAN WITH SHOES THAT HAVE A LITTLE HEEL
gIU-VuKqGgA_1 0 A BIG PART ABOUT PLAYING THE DIDGERIDOO IS YOUR BREATHING TECHNIQUE IT'S A HUGE PART OF THAT
gIU-VuKqGgA_2 0 THERE'S A FEW BREATHING EXERCISES THAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU BEFORE YOU REALLY EVEN BEGIN TO PLAY BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO KIND OF PUT YOU IN THE RIGHT PATH FOR DOING IT
gIU-VuKqGgA_3 0 THERE'S A VERY SPECIALIZED TECHNIQUE WITH THE DIDGERIDOO CALLED CIRCULAR BREATHING WHICH WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT LATER
gIU-VuKqGgA_4 0 IT'S ONE OF THE MORE ADVANCED TECHNIQUES BUT THESE ARE SOME VERY SIMPLE ONES THAT YOU CAN DO JUST TO GET STARTED
gIU-VuKqGgA_5 0 THE EXERCISE IS THIS
gIU-VuKqGgA_6 0 WE'RE GOING TO DO A PATTERN WHERE YOU BREATHE IN FOR FIVE COUNTS AND BREATHE OUT FOR FIVE COUNTS VERY SLOWLY
gIU-VuKqGgA_7 0 VERY IMPORTANTLY YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO BREATHE IN THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND OUT THROUGH YOUR MOUTH LIKE THIS
gIU-VuKqGgA_8 0 IN THROUGH THE NOSE OUT THROUGH THE MOUTH
gIU-VuKqGgA_9 0 IT'S GOOD TO DO THAT ABOUT TEN OR TWELVE TIMES BEFORE YOU EVEN BEGIN TO PLAY
gIU-VuKqGgA_10 0 I STILL DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD WAY TO WARM UP AND KIND OF GET FOCUSED AND GET INTO THE RIGHT MODE FOR PLAYING
gIU-VuKqGgA_11 0 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU COULD DO WHICH WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE AMOUNT OF AIR THAT YOU CAN FIT INTO YOUR LUNGS IS TO THINK OF TERM OF FILLING FROM THE BOTTOM UP
gIU-VuKqGgA_12 0 THAT'S THE WAY THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO GET THE BIGGEST BREATH OF AIR INTO YOUR LUNGS
gIU-VuKqGgA_13 0 IF YOU TAKE A BREATH FROM UP HERE IN YOUR CHEST LIKE THAT YOUR SHOULDERS TEND TO RISE UP AND IT'S NOT REALLY GREAT FOR YOUR TECHNIQUE AND IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THE BEST WAY TO GET THE LARGE BREATH
gIU-VuKqGgA_14 0 IF YOU THINK FROM FILLING FROM THE BOTTOM UP YOU SHOULD EVEN FEEL YOUR STOMACH MOVING OUT
gIU-VuKqGgA_15 0 JUST LIKE FILLING UP A GLASS OF WATER
gIU-VuKqGgA_16 0 BREATHING IN THROUGH THE NOSE AND OUT THROUGH THE MOUTH
gIU-VuKqGgA_17 0 AGAIN DO THAT ABOUT TEN OR TWELVE TIMES TO WARM-UP
gIU-VuKqGgA_18 0 IF YOU FIND YOURSELF GETTING KIND OF LIGHTHEADED OR DIZZY JUST STOP FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND GO BACK AND TRY IT AGAIN
gIU-VuKqGgA_19 0 THE IDEA IS THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE ANYTHING FORCED ABOUT YOUR BREATHING
gIU-VuKqGgA_20 0 IT SHOULD FEEL VERY RELAXED LIKE YOGA BREATHING
gIU-VuKqGgA_21 0 IF YOU'RE GETTING LIGHTHEADED YOU'RE PROBABLY JUST BREATHING TOO HEAVILY TRYING TO FORCE TOO MUCH AIR IN AND OUT
gIU-VuKqGgA_22 0 TRY THAT TEN OR TWELVE TIMES AND YOU'VE GO YOURSELF PERFECTLY SETUP TO ACTUALLY PLAY THE INSTRUMENT
gwNyAwAKyOs_1 0 I LOVE THE BALL YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN THESE IN THE GYMS ALL OVER THE PLACE
gwNyAwAKyOs_2 0 THIS IS A PRETTY SMALL ONE THAT WORKS FOR ME AND I FOUND THE PERFECT SPOT TO GIVE YOU A CREATIVE SUGGESTION FOR A PLANK AND BASICALLY SOMEWHAT OF A PUSH-UP COMBINATION
gwNyAwAKyOs_3 0 I'M GOING TO TAKE THE BALL AND I'M GOING TO PUT IT RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE
gwNyAwAKyOs_4 0 I'M GOING TO LINE UP MY WRISTS HERE MY ELBOW AND MY SHOULDERS
gwNyAwAKyOs_5 0 THIS IS PRETTY SIMPLE AND IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER THIS IS PROBABLY ENOUGH FOR YOU
gwNyAwAKyOs_6 0 I'M GOING TO LOWER MY BACK INTO THIS KEEP MY ABS IN TIGHT
gwNyAwAKyOs_7 0 NOW LET'S MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE CHALLENGING
gwNyAwAKyOs_8 0 I'M GOING TO TAKE MY LEGS I'M GOING TO TAKE THEM AND EXTEND THEM OUT I'M GOING TO LOWER MY BODY INTO THIS NOW WATCH WHAT I JUST DID
gwNyAwAKyOs_9 0 WHOOPS ELBOWS IN I HAD MY ELBOWS OUT A LITTLE BIT
gwNyAwAKyOs_10 0 BRING MY ELBOWS IN AND IF I ROLL IT UP A LITTLE WOW MY STOMACH IS REALLY WORKING A LOT HARDER AND BRING IT BACK DOWN
gwNyAwAKyOs_11 0 WATCH FOR YOUR WRISTS MAKE SURE THEY ARE NOT HURTING YOU BUT BOY IS THAT TOUGH
gwNyAwAKyOs_12 0 GOOD COMBINATION LOVE THAT ONE
gwNyAwAKyOs_13 0 DEFINITELY ADD THAT ONE IN
GC7KP61ReoQ_1 0 ABOUT THIS TIME NOW THAT YOUR CHILD IS LEARNING SOME WORDS LEARNING HOW TO SOUND OUT AND CREATE THEIR OWN WORDS YOU CAN BEGIN TO HAVE THEM DO A DAILY WRITING SAMPLE
GC7KP61ReoQ_2 0 AND IT'S NICE TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER AND SO WE CALL THAT A DAILY JOURNAL ALTHOUGH IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A JOURNAL IN THE SENSE OF HOW YOU MIGHT THINK A DIARY OR KEEPING PERSONAL THOUGHTS
GC7KP61ReoQ_3 0 THERE COULD BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT THEY WRITE ABOUT EVERY DAY
GC7KP61ReoQ_4 0 SOME DAYS I LIKE TO CALL THEM FREE WRITES YOU CAN SAY WRITE ABOUT ANYTHING YOU WANT
GC7KP61ReoQ_5 0 OTHER DAYS TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE BIT OF AN IDEA YOU CAN GIVE THEM A SENTENCE STARTER SUCH AS ONE DAY I AND TELL THEM TO FINISH THAT YOU CAN EVEN WRITE IT ON THEIR PAGE ONE DAY I AND THEN TELL THEM TO FINISH
GC7KP61ReoQ_6 0 OR YOU COULD SAY I FOUND A DOG WHO BE CREATIVE OR YOU COULD SAY WE JUST WENT ON A TRIP YESTERDAY TELL ME ABOUT THE TRIP IN YOUR DAILY JOURNAL TODAY
GC7KP61ReoQ_7 0 AND IT'S THEIR TIME TO REALLY START LEARNING CREATIVE WRITING EXPRESSING THEMSELVES
GC7KP61ReoQ_8 0 WHAT I DO IS I TAKE YOU COULD DO THIS YOU COULD USE A NOTEBOOK BUT BASICALLY WHAT I DO IS THE TOP THIRD OF THE PAGE I BOX OFF HAVE THEM DRAW A SQUARE OR RECTANGLE AND USE THAT TO DRAW A PICTURE
GC7KP61ReoQ_9 0 THEY DON'T GET TO DRAW THE PICTURE UNTIL THEY FINISH WRITING THAT'S KIND OF THE RULE IT'S LIKE OF A REWARD AT THE END
GC7KP61ReoQ_10 0 HAVE THEM ALWAYS START OUT BY PUTTING THEIR NAME AND DATE
GC7KP61ReoQ_11 0 BY THIS TIME YOU SHOULD BE TEACHING THEM HOW TO WRITE THE DATE
GC7KP61ReoQ_12 0 YOU CAN TAKE THE TWELVE MONTHS AND PUT THEM ON FLASH CARDS AND THEY CAN MEMORIZE THEM THEY CAN'T SPELL THEM PERFECTLY THEY CAN TAKE OUT THE FLASH CARD AND COPY BUT TEACH THEM TO WRITE THE DATE AND THEN DOWN HERE THEY WRITE THEIR STORY AND IF YOU WANT THEM TO HAVE GOOD HANDWRITING WHICH I DO
GC7KP61ReoQ_13 0 I WOULD EITHER TAKE MY COMPUTER AND MAKE A SHEET WITH A BOX ALREADY MADE AND SOME HANDWRITING AND THEN TAKE A BUNCH OF THOSE SHEETS AND STAPLE THEM TOGETHER AND CALL THAT YOUR JOURNAL MAKE A COVER OR YOU COULD TAKE YOUR HANDWRITING PAPER MINE IS SHAPED KIND OF FUNNY BUT I MANAGE TO MAKE IT WORK PICTURE THERE NAME DATE AND THEN THEY HAVE THREE LINES TO WRITE AND THAT IS HOW WE DO OUR DAILY JOURNAL

GAFIPghxWbM_15 0 NOW AGAIN LET'S DO IT SLOW
GAFIPghxWbM_16 0 STEP AND TOUCH STEP AND TOUCH TWO MORE STEP AND TOUCH AND STEP AND TOUCH
GAFIPghxWbM_17 0 NOW FOR OUR HANDS WE'RE GOING TO DO UP AND DOWN UP DOWN UP DOWN AND LAST ONE
GAFIPghxWbM_18 0 TOGETHER IT'S GOING TO BE ONE TWO STEP AND TOUCH
GAFIPghxWbM_19 0 GREAT AND TOUCH LAST ONE TOGETHER
GAFIPghxWbM_20 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT A LITTLE BIT FASTER NOW
GAFIPghxWbM_22 0 ONE AND TWO MORE
GAFIPghxWbM_24 0 NOW YOU'RE READY TO LEARN THE NEXT STEP
G4v22kM4QnA_1 0 TINA STULL HI
G4v22kM4QnA_2 0 I'M TINA STULL AND I DRIVE THE TOP DRAGSTER FOR INTERSTATE BATTERIES
G4v22kM4QnA_3 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS ON BEING MENTALLY PREPARED FOR A RUN
G4v22kM4QnA_4 0 ONE THING THAT I KNOW THAT A LOT OF DRIVERS DON'T DO IS WHEN THEY GET ALL TENSED UP AND THEY BELTED DOWN IN THOSE PRESSURE THEY DON'T BREATH
G4v22kM4QnA_5 0 SO I WOULD GO THROUGH KIND OF JUST A SOME DEEP BREATHING AS I'M SETTLING IN AND JUST TRYING TO THINK ABOUT MY LANE
G4v22kM4QnA_6 0 ONCE YOU DO THAT YOU HAVE ALL YOU CAN DO IS LET YOURSELF PERFORM
G4v22kM4QnA_7 0 THERE'S SO MUCH ANXIETY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING WRONG
G4v22kM4QnA_8 0 IF YOU'VE GONE OVER AND OVER IN YOUR HEAD WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO ALL THE WAY FROM YOUR BURNOUT TO YOUR STAGING YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN DO IT RIGHT IF YOU'VE DONE IT BEFORE AND YOU JUST REMEMBER AT THAT POINT THAT IF YOU LET YOURSELF DO IT THAT YOU'LL DO THE RIGHT THING
G4v22kM4QnA_9 0 AND TAKE THAT PRESSURE OFF OF YOU THATWHAT IF I DO THE WRONG THING
G4v22kM4QnA_10 0 AND THEN YOU RELY ON WHAT YOU'VE PRACTICED
G4v22kM4QnA_11 0 AND YOU JUST GO OUT THERE AND DO IT
G4v22kM4QnA_12 0 IT'S ALWAYS AMAZING TO ME HOW WE CAN DO SOMETHING RIGHT TIME AFTER TIME AND YET WE ALWAYS GO BACK TO THAT ONE TIME THAT MAYBE WE SCREWED UP
G4v22kM4QnA_13 0 SO WE NEED TO TAKE THOSE AND FLUSH THEM AWAY GET THEM OUT OF OUR HEAD AND REALIZE THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING
G4v22kM4QnA_14 0 BY THAT POINT YOU'RE UP THERE YOU'RE STAGING YOU'RE IN YOUR LANE YOU KNOW YOUR STRATEGY AND NOW YOU JUST GOT TO GO DELIVER WHAT YOU AND YOUR CREW CHIEF HAVE ALREADY DECIDED
glY9q7Mq3Uo_1 0 WHEN I FIRST STARTED THIS BUSINESS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE DIFFICULT ARE GETTING CLIENTELE AND HOW TO GO ABOUT DOING THAT AND YOUR MARKETING STRATEGIES
glY9q7Mq3Uo_2 0 YOU GO THROUGH A WHOLE BUSINESS PLAN IN YOUR HEAD AND YOU WRITE THINGS DOWN AND YOU HAVE A GREAT BUSINESS PLAN IN MIND AND HOW DO YOU TAKE IT FROM BEING ON PAPER TO ACTUALLY OPENING THE BUSINESS AND STARTING TO WORK
glY9q7Mq3Uo_3 0 THOSE WERE SOME THINGS THAT WERE REALLY TOUGH
glY9q7Mq3Uo_4 0 I'M REALLY GREAT AT PUTTING THINGS ON PAPER AND I'M REALLY GOOD AT TALKING TO PEOPLE BUT ACTUALLY GETTING OUT THERE AND ASKING FOR BUSINESS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY HARD FOR ME TO DO
glY9q7Mq3Uo_5 0 SO I FOUND THAT IT WAS REALLY GREAT USING A FREE CLASSIFIED ADVERTISING AND I JUST PUT ADS ON THERE AND I JUST DECIDED YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS SOMETHING I WANT TO DO
glY9q7Mq3Uo_6 0 I WANT TO MAKE SOME EXTRA MONEY
glY9q7Mq3Uo_7 0 I WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO DURING THE DAY BUT I STILL WANT TO BE ABLE TO BE WITH MY KIDS AND MY FAMILY SO IT WAS SOMETHING WHERE I JUST I KNEW THAT I HAD TO TAKE IT FROM PAPER TO ACTUALLY SOME SORT OF ACTION AND IT'S SOMETHING YOU JUST HAVE TO JUMP IN AND DO AND REALLY FINDING SOME FREE ADVERTISING IS I THINK WAS THE BEST THING THAT I COULD HAVE DONE WAS PUTTING JUST A FREE AD ON THERE AND GETTING THE RESPONSE THAT YOU GET BECAUSE SOMETIMES MAYBE YOU WON'T GET A RESPONSE BUT THAT'S OK THAT'S JUST ANOTHER HURDLE THAT YOU TACKLE AT THE TIME BUT THE RESPONSE WAS GREAT AND YOU HAVE TO PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE AND REALLY GO INTO DOING WHAT YOU WANT TO DO FULL HEARTEDLY AND GIVING IT YOUR ALL AND JUST TAKING A RISK
glY9q7Mq3Uo_8 0 SO SOME TIPS ON BEING A GOOD MAID WOULD BE JUST PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO DETAIL TO THE SMALL THINGS THAT PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT WIPING DOWN
glY9q7Mq3Uo_9 0 FINGERPRINTS ON THE FRIDGE WIPING DOWN THE LIGHT SWITCHES
glY9q7Mq3Uo_10 0 SOMETHING THAT I DO IS LEAVE A LITTLE NOTE OF THANK YOU AND A MINT OR SOMETHING
glY9q7Mq3Uo_11 0 SOMETHING THAT SETS YOU APART FROM THE REST OF THE INDUSTRY
glY9q7Mq3Uo_12 0 COME UP WITH THAT LITTLE PERSONAL TOUCH AND GO FROM THERE
glY9q7Mq3Uo_13 0 SOME THINGS TO MAKE SURE YOU STAY AWAY FROM WOULD BE TAKING ANYTHING THAT IS NOT YOURS
glY9q7Mq3Uo_14 0 MAKING SURE THAT YOU DON'T DAMAGE SOMETHING AND IF YOU DO BECAUSE ACCIDENTS DO HAPPEN
glY9q7Mq3Uo_15 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOU COME CLEAN ABOUT IT AND LET THEM KNOW THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED AND NOT TRY AND COVER THINGS LIKE THAT UP SO THOSE ARE SOME TIPS
glY9q7Mq3Uo_16 0 JUST FINDING YOUR WAY YOUR PERSONAL TOUCH AND GOING FOR IT
GCPe2Za7JV8_1 0 NOW I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH AN OLD BUTTON FLY
GCPe2Za7JV8_2 0 I'M GOING TO MAKE A LACING UP PORTION FOR OUR PLAY MAT
GCPe2Za7JV8_3 0 AND SO AND YOU CAN USE THE BUTTONS FOR JUST A TOUCHY FEELY SECTION
GCPe2Za7JV8_4 0 SO WE'LL CUT THE BUTTONS AWAY FROM THE BUTTON FLY
GCPe2Za7JV8_5 0 AND FOR THIS ONE I'M GOING TO TRIM JUST TRIM UP THE EDGE AND WE'LL JUST SEW THAT DOWN TO THE MAT
GCPe2Za7JV8_6 0 AND IT'S JUST KIND OF A FUN THING TO TOUCH AND FEEL
GCPe2Za7JV8_7 0 AND THEN WITH THE BUTTONHOLE PORTION I'VE GOT TWO YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TWO BUTTON FLY THINGS AND I'M GOING TO JUST TRIM THESE UP SO THAT I HAVE THE BUTTON HOLES ON EITHER SIDE
GCPe2Za7JV8_8 0 AND WE'LL USE A LACE TO SO THAT THE CHILD CAN PRACTICE HIS LACING UP
GCPe2Za7JV8_9 0 SO TO PREPARE THIS THE BUTTON FLIES WERE BOTH HEADED IN THIS DIRECTION SO I REALLY WANT THEM TO FACE EACH OTHER SO THAT THE LACING IS MORE EASY AND I HAVE FOUR BUTTON HOLES HERE BUT I HAVE FIVE HERE
GCPe2Za7JV8_10 0 SO I'M GOING TO CUT OFF THIS BOTTOM BUTTONHOLE
GCPe2Za7JV8_11 0 AND WE'LL DISCARD THAT
GCPe2Za7JV8_12 0 AND I'VE CUT IT OPEN SLIGHT HERE SO THAT I CAN OPEN UP THE FLAP UP AND EXPOSE THE BUTTONHOLES
GCPe2Za7JV8_13 0 SO WE'LL PIN THAT DOWN IN THAT POSITION
GCPe2Za7JV8_14 0 AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE I'M GOING TO REMOVE THIS FLAP IS UNDERNEATH
GCPe2Za7JV8_15 0 AGAIN I'VE CUT IT OFF AT THE TOP HERE
GCPe2Za7JV8_16 0 I'M GOING TO REMOVE THIS BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE DOWN AT THE BOTTOM AND YOU DON'T WANT IT TO GET IN THE WAY OF THE CHILD WHILE THEY'RE DOING THEIR LACING
GCPe2Za7JV8_17 0 SO WE'LL JUST CUT THAT OFF AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN AND WE'LL PIN THIS DOWN AND WE'LL JUST BE TOP STITCHING THAT ALSO
GCPe2Za7JV8_18 0 AND I'LL PIN THIS IN PLACE WITH THE FLAP OPEN
GCPe2Za7JV8_20 0 YOU'LL WANT TO PUT A COUPLE PINS IN THERE TO HOLD IT IN PLACE FOR YOUR TOP STITCHING
GCPe2Za7JV8_21 0 AND THEN YOU CAN GET A NICE COLORFUL LACE
GCPe2Za7JV8_22 0 I'VE GOT A NICE COLORFUL LACE
GCPe2Za7JV8_23 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT HAS THE LITTLE HARD ENDS ON IT
GCPe2Za7JV8_24 0 MAKES IT A LOT EASY FOR THOSE LITTLE FINGERS TO GET THE LACE THROUGH THE HOLES AND THEN THE CHILD CAN LACE UP THROUGH ALL THESE NICE BUTTONHOLES
GtpTV01T2iY_1 0 FROM MOUNTAIN POSE FOLD FORWARD INTO THE FORWARD BEND THEN STEP YOUR RIGHT LEG BACK BEHIND YOU ABOUT THREE TO THREE AND A HALF FEET
GtpTV01T2iY_2 0 MAKE SURE YOUR HEELS ARE LINING UP WITH EACH OTHER SO THE HEELS ARE IN LINE IN THIS POSE
GtpTV01T2iY_3 0 THE BACK TOES WILL TURN AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE TOWARD THE RIGHT SO THEY ARE NOT AS OPEN AS IN SOME OF OUR OTHER STANDING POSES LIKE THAT BUT THEY ARE TURNED IN QUITE A BIT MORE DEEPLY
GtpTV01T2iY_4 0 THEN YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE A DEEP BEND IN YOUR FRONT LEG AND BRING YOUR HIPS MORE SQUARE IN LINE WITH EACH OTHER
GtpTV01T2iY_5 0 TO DO THIS YOU CAN FOLD FORWARD AND MOVE YOUR BACK THIGH BACK TOWARD THE WALL BEHIND YOU AS THE BACK THIGH MOVES BACK YOU WILL GET MORE SPACE TO BRING THE HIP AROUND THEN KEEPING THE DEEP BEND IN YOUR FRONT LEG INHALE AND LIFT THE SPINE LONG AND SWEEP THE ARMS TOWARD THE SKY
GtpTV01T2iY_6 0 THIS IS VIRABHADRASANA ONE WARRIOR ONE
GtpTV01T2iY_7 0 EXHALE AND FOLD AND FROM INHALE STEP FORWARD AND FROM UTTANASANA YOU CAN TAKE THE SECOND SIDE
gnL24bqNJqE_1 0 HI MY NAME IS JIM DEYOUNG
gnL24bqNJqE_2 0 I'M HERE WITH FAT CATS FAMILY BOWLING CENTER IN SALT LAKE CITY UTAH
gnL24bqNJqE_3 0 YOU CAN SEE US ON THE WEB FATCATSFUN.COM
gnL24bqNJqE_4 0 I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
gnL24bqNJqE_5 0 RIGHT NOW WE ARE GOING TO GO OVER SOME STRETCHES AND SOME EXERCISES TO GET YOU READY AND WARMED UP FOR BOWLING
gnL24bqNJqE_6 0 THE FIRST THING I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS I LIKE TO GET MY SHOULDERS LOOSE
gnL24bqNJqE_7 0 SO SOMETIMES IF YOU HOLD ANYTHING SOMETIMES A BOWLING BALL THE BALL THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE
gnL24bqNJqE_8 0 YOU CAN JUST SWING IT BACK AND FORWARD WARM UP YOUR ARM A LITTLE BIT
gnL24bqNJqE_9 0 WHAT THIS WILL DO IS IT WILL GET YOUR SHOULDER GOING SO YOU DON'T WIND UP TEARING ANYTHING OR RIPPING ANYTHING
gnL24bqNJqE_10 0 SO AFTER A LITTLE BIT OF THIS I'LL SWITCH OFF AND I'LL GO TO A FULL CIRCLE WITH MY BOWLING BALL
gnL24bqNJqE_11 0 BASICALLY THIS A GOOD EXERCISE FOR YOUR ROTATOR CUFF AND FOR YOUR JOINT
gnL24bqNJqE_12 0 ALRIGHT AND AFTER THAT I LIKE TO SWITCH OVER TO A GOOD ARM STRETCH
gnL24bqNJqE_13 0 GRAB YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK
gnL24bqNJqE_14 0 STRETCH DOWN AND PULL UP
gnL24bqNJqE_15 0 WHAT THAT WILL DO IS STRETCH YOUR BICEPS A LITTLE BIT
gnL24bqNJqE_16 0 ADD A LITTLE MORE TENSION TO YOUR ARMS SO IT WILL STRETCH OUT THOSE MUSCLES SO YOU DON'T TEAR ANYTHING OR RIP ANYTHING
gnL24bqNJqE_17 0 ALRIGHT AND AFTER I DO THAT I JUST LIKE TO GET USED TO THE APPROACH REALLY QUICK WITH MY BOWLING SHOES
gnL24bqNJqE_18 0 I'M WEARING A PAIR OF DEXTER SST5'S
gnL24bqNJqE_19 0 SO WHAT I WILL DO IS I'LL JUST LINE UP ANYWHERE AND THEN I WILL TEST THE APPROACH
gnL24bqNJqE_20 0 THAT GIVES ME A GOOD IDEA ON HOW SLICK THE APPROACHES ARE
gnL24bqNJqE_21 0 IF I NEED TO CHANGE PADS ON THE BOTTOM OF MY SHOE OR IF I NEED TO GRAB A BRUSH AND TAKE OFF SOME OF THE TOP SURFACE ON THE PADS
gnL24bqNJqE_22 0 SO I AM GOING TO DO IT AGAIN JUST TO GET USED TO IT
gnL24bqNJqE_23 0 SO BASICALLY NOW YOU'RE READY TO PRACTICE AND THROW A BALL
GUFNUpQ8KrE_1 0 OK THE NEXT STEP IS THE FIRE BOARD
GUFNUpQ8KrE_2 0 YOU CAN SEE THE LENGTH OF THIS FIRE BOARD I HAVE A FEW HOLES ALREADY BURNED
GUFNUpQ8KrE_4 0 SEE THE THICKNESS
GUFNUpQ8KrE_5 0 IT SIMILAR TO THE CUT IN THE HAND HELD BUT A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND NOT AS THICK
GUFNUpQ8KrE_6 0 CUT IT OFF THE SYCAMORE
GUFNUpQ8KrE_7 0 AND THE FIRST STEP IS YOU WANT TO BURN OK
GUFNUpQ8KrE_8 0 YOU WANT TO BURN THE NOTCH
GUFNUpQ8KrE_9 0 OK HERE'S MY FIRE BOARD SIMILAR TO THE HAND HELD NOT AS THICK AND THIS IS A LONGER AND NOT AS THICK
GUFNUpQ8KrE_10 0 YOU CAN SEE
GUFNUpQ8KrE_11 0 YOU CAN MAKE IT AS LONG AS YOU WANT BUT IT HAS TO BE COMFORTABLE FOR YOUR FOOT
GUFNUpQ8KrE_12 0 NOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH THE FIRE BOARD IS TO TAKE THE SPINDLE THE ONE THAT I JUST CUT
GUFNUpQ8KrE_13 0 IT NEEDS TO BE BURNED INTO THE FIRE BOARD
GUFNUpQ8KrE_14 0 YOU NEED TO CREATE A LITTLE NOTCH OK WITH YOUR KNIFE
GUFNUpQ8KrE_15 0 A VERY SIMPLE WAY TO CREATE A NOTCH AND IT NEEDS TO BE BURNED IN
GUFNUpQ8KrE_16 0 VERY IMPORTANT TO BE BURNED IN AND ONCE IT'S BURNED IN WHERE THIS BECOMES WHERE THIS BECOMES ROUNDED YOU STOP
GUFNUpQ8KrE_18 0 ONCE THIS BECOMES ROUNDED LIKE THIS YOU STOP
GUFNUpQ8KrE_19 0 BECAUSE THE NEXT STEP WHICH I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IN A MINUTE IS CUTTING THE NOTCH
GiSBTBfnZUY_1 0 AS I MENTIONED THE PROJECT HAS INTRODUCED TO WOOD TURNING
GiSBTBfnZUY_2 0 THIS HAD PROBABLY HAD SOME OF THE MOST IMPACT ON BEGINNING TURNERS
GiSBTBfnZUY_3 0 GETTING STARTED IN THE CRAFT HAS BEEN TURNING PENS
GiSBTBfnZUY_4 0 AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THIS
GiSBTBfnZUY_5 0 FOR ONE THING IT'S FAIRLY EASY TO GET INTO PEN TURNING WITHOUT SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY
GiSBTBfnZUY_6 0 PENS ARE SMALL SO THEY CAN BE DONE ON A MINI LAY LIKE THIS
GiSBTBfnZUY_7 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET A FULL SIZED LAYS
GiSBTBfnZUY_8 0 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPANIES THAT PRODUCE MONOLAYS LIKE THIS THAT USUALLY RETAIL IN THE THREE HUNDRED RANGE
GiSBTBfnZUY_9 0 AND THEY'RE EXCELLENT LAYS AND YOU CAN DO A LOT OF WORK ON THEM
GiSBTBfnZUY_10 0 AS FAR AS THE PINS GO THEY OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY TO FAIRLY QUICKLY MAKE A FINISHED PROJECT PRODUCT THAT IS USEFUL THAT PEOPLE ENJOY AND THAT IS FUN TO MAKE
GiSBTBfnZUY_11 0 ANOTHER NICE THING ABOUT THEM IS YOU GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH SOME REALLY REMARKABLE MATERIALS
GiSBTBfnZUY_12 0 WHETHER THAT THE REALLY SPECTACULAR WOODS LIKE THIS BURROW THAT HAS BEEN PARTIALLY DYED
GiSBTBfnZUY_13 0 THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLASTICS THAT ARE AVAILABLE
GiSBTBfnZUY_14 0 GOOD HARD WOODS BOTH EXOTIC AND HARD WOODS
GiSBTBfnZUY_15 0 YOU CAN LAMINATE WOODS UP LIKE THIS TO MAKE BLANKS OUT OF
GiSBTBfnZUY_16 0 AND EVEN ANTLER
GiSBTBfnZUY_17 0 MAKES A VERY NICE PEN
GiSBTBfnZUY_18 0 AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER MATERIALS THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING PENS OUT OF
GiSBTBfnZUY_19 0 AND SO IT'S A GOOD WAY TO GET INTO TURNING AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO WOOD TURNING BY TURNING PENS
HcMF3dG1AHg_2 0 THIS IS RAINER WICKEL AND I AM HERE WITH EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
HcMF3dG1AHg_3 0 WELL WE ARE ON TO OUR NEXT STEP IN MAKING WIENER SCHNITZEL AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE GOING TO BE GOING OVER THE INGREDIENTS THAT WE USE TO COMPLETE OUR DISH
HcMF3dG1AHg_4 0 OF COURSE WE NEED PORK CHOPS AND WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF NICE THICK ONES RIGHT HERE WHICH WE ARE GOING TO CUT UP
HcMF3dG1AHg_5 0 WE ALSO NEED FLOUR FOR DIPPING WE NEED BREAD CRUMBS AND WE NEED TWO EGGS
HcMF3dG1AHg_6 0 NOW WE ARE GOING TO PUT THESE SEPARATELY IN THREE DIFFERENT BOWLS AND WE ARE GOING TO DIP THE SCHNITZEL IN THEM AND WE ARE GOING TO FRY THEM
HcMF3dG1AHg_7 0 THE BREAD CRUMBS BEING THE LAST THING THAT WE DIP THEM IN
HcMF3dG1AHg_8 0 OF COURSE I ALSO LIKE TO USE GROUND PEPPER AND SEA SALT WHICH IS A PERSONAL PREFERENCE OF MINE
HcMF3dG1AHg_9 0 NOW THE PEPPER AND THE SALT WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE PUTTING INTO THE FLOUR MIXTURE BECAUSE THAT IS GOING TO BIND WITH THE SCHNITZEL AND THAT IS GOING TO GIVE IT A REALLY FLAVOR
HcMF3dG1AHg_10 0 I AM GOING TO BE COOKING THE SCHNITZEL TODAY IN OLIVE OIL
HcMF3dG1AHg_11 0 NOW USUALLY WHEN COOKING SCHNITZELS YOU CAN EITHER COOK THEM IN OIL OR USUALLY THEY COOK THEM IN BUTTER TOO BUT I AM CHOOSING OLIVE OIL TODAY BECAUSE IT IS A LOT HEALTHIER
HcMF3dG1AHg_12 0 IF YOU COOK THEM IN BUTTER IT IS GOING TO BE AN EXTREMELY FATTY MEAL
HcMF3dG1AHg_13 0 BUT THIS ALSO GIVES IT A LOT BETTER FLAVOR AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING WITH TODAY
HcMF3dG1AHg_14 0 LASTLY WE HAVE A LEMON
HcMF3dG1AHg_15 0 OKAY THE LEMON IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO USE AT THE END WHEN WE SERVE THE SCHNITZEL
HcMF3dG1AHg_16 0 YOU ALWAYS PUT A SLICE OF LEMON ON TOP OF IT BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE SERVING THE SCHNITZEL YOU TAKE THAT LEMON AND SQUEEZE THE LEMON JUICE ALL OVER THE SCHNITZEL AND IT GIVES IT THAT ADDITIONAL TANGY FLAVOR AND THESE ARE BASICALLY ALL THE INGREDIENTS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE A WIENER SCHNITZEL
hahHzzWNo0w_1 0 SARAH HAUER HI
hahHzzWNo0w_2 0 I'M SARAH HAUER
hahHzzWNo0w_3 0 SIG HAUER AND I'M SIG HAUER AND WE'RE PROFESSIONAL PRACTITIONERS OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE
hahHzzWNo0w_4 0 SARAH HAUER WE'RE HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
hahHzzWNo0w_5 0 SIG HAUER AND WELCOME TO OUR VIDEO
hahHzzWNo0w_6 0 PAIN IS THAT AREA WE'RE PROBABLY BEST KNOWN FOR
hahHzzWNo0w_7 0 TYPICALLY THE MAJORITY OF OUR PATIENTS COME FIRST BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT SOME COMPLAINT ABOUT A PARTICULAR PAIN
hahHzzWNo0w_8 0 OF COURSE AS WE LEARN ABOUT THE PATIENT AND THE PATIENT ACTUALLY LEARNS A FEW THINGS ABOUT THEMSELVES THEY FIND THAT OTHER THINGS START TO GET BETTER AS WE TREAT THEM ABOUT PAIN
hahHzzWNo0w_9 0 BUT CERTAIN CONDITIONS IN PAIN THAT WE HAVE DONE VERY WELL WITH AND THERE ARE MORE THAN WHAT I'M GOING TO MENTION OF COURSE BUT THINGS LIKE MIGRAINE HEADACHES LOW BACK PAIN NECK PAIN JUST ABOUT ANY KIND OF HEADACHE SARAH HAUER ARTHRITIS
hahHzzWNo0w_10 0 SIG HAUER ARTHRITIS TMJ
hahHzzWNo0w_11 0 IF IT HURTS WE CAN PROBABLY HELP WITH IT
hahHzzWNo0w_12 0 TYPICALLY WE SEE FOR EXAMPLE WITH LOW BACK PAIN I SEE PEOPLE RESPOND IN ANYWHERE FROM ONE TWO ABOUT EIGHT TREATMENTS THAT THEY START TO RESPOND VERY WELL AND SHOW SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT
hahHzzWNo0w_13 0 ONE PARTICULAR CASE I CAN THINK OF WAS A GENTLEMAN ABOUT 65 YEARS OLD A RETIRED SCHOOL TEACHER HIS BACK HAD GONE OUT
hahHzzWNo0w_14 0 HE'S VERY ACTIVE EXERCISED A LOT DID A LOT OF STRETCHING SO HE IS SURPRISED THAT HIS BACK WENT OUT
hahHzzWNo0w_15 0 IT TOOK ONE TREATMENT
hahHzzWNo0w_16 0 AND QUITE HONESTLY IT USUALLY TAKES A FEW TREATMENTS BUT THIS GENTLEMAN BECAUSE HE DOES TAKE SUCH GOOD CARE OF HIMSELF HE IS VERY PHYSICALLY FIT ONE TREATMENT HE RESPONDED VERY WELL AND THE BACK PAIN WENT AWAY AND DID NOT REOCCUR AFTER THAT
GQefb82rktc_1 0 ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS THAT I'VE FOUND WITH WATER COLOR
GQefb82rktc_2 0 MY DEGREE IS IN DRAWING AND I'M VERY GOOD AT DRAWING BUT IT ALSO TAKES ME A LOT OF TIME
GQefb82rktc_3 0 AND THE MORE TIME IT TAKES TO PAINT A PAINTING THE LESS INCOME BASICALLY
GQefb82rktc_4 0 SO THE REASON I USE A PROJECTOR AND PROJECT THE IMAGE IS TO GET A LOT OF DETAIL IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME SO I CAN FOCUS ON THE PAINTING
GQefb82rktc_5 0 AND AS YOU'LL SEE ON THIS PIECE HERE WHICH I'VE ALREADY LAID OUT THERE'S A NUMBER OF VERY INTRICATE DETAILS ON THIS THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME AN EXTRAORDINARILY LONG TIME TO ACTUALLY PAINT
GQefb82rktc_6 0 SO AS AN EXAMPLE THE BRIDLE ON THIS HORSE
GQefb82rktc_7 0 THIS YOUNG LADIES MOTHER ACTUALLY MADE IT BY HAND
GQefb82rktc_8 0 THIS IS BEAD WORK
GQefb82rktc_9 0 AND ALL OF THE LEATHER WORK AND STUFF
GQefb82rktc_10 0 PEOPLE KNOW WHEN THAT'S INCORRECT IF YOU DO THAT THEY KNOW IF ANYTHINGS OUT OF PLACE WITH THE ANIMAL
GQefb82rktc_11 0 ANYTHING LIKE THAT
GQefb82rktc_12 0 SO BY PROJECTING YOUR IMAGE AND GETTING ALL THE TIGHT DETAIL GETTING THE EYES PERFECT GETTING THE PERSPECTIVE PERFECT
GQefb82rktc_13 0 THAT TAKES SOME OF THE WEIGHT OFF OF GETTING THE DRAWING RIGHT
GQefb82rktc_14 0 YOU CAN FOCUS MORE ON THE PAINTING
GQefb82rktc_15 0 YOU CAN EXPERIMENT MORE WITH TECHNIQUES AND YOU CAN CREATE MORE PAINTINGS THAN YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO OTHERWISE
-GSIhHwFs04_1 0 WILLIE AND GINA ARE GOING TO HELP ME DEMONSTRATE A REALLY FUN POSE CALLED HEAVEN AND EARTH
-GSIhHwFs04_2 0 IN THIS PARTICULAR POSE WILLIE IS GOING TO BE THE HEAVEN AND GINA IS GOING TO GET TO BE THE EARTH BECAUSE WE WANTED TO SHOW YOU THAT IT IS NOT ALWAYS THE LARGER OR HEAVIER MALE PARTNER THAT IS ON THE BOTTOM TAKING THE WEIGHT
-GSIhHwFs04_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE GINA COME ON TO THE GROUND YES SHE'S GOING TO BRING HER KNEES FORWARD AND SHE IS GOING TO COME INTO A MODIFIED CHILD'S POSE TAKING HER FINGERS IN SO HER ELBOWS CAN BE OUT TO THE SIDE
-GSIhHwFs04_4 0 WILLIE IS GOING TO COME FORWARD WITH A PLANK POSE WITH HIS WRISTS RIGHT NEXT TO GINA'S HIPS AND THAT HAS TO BE ADJUSTED TO HOW TALL YOU ARE OF COURSE
-GSIhHwFs04_5 0 WILLIE IS GOING TO LOWER DOWN GENTLY AND PLACE HIS HANDS ON GINA'S KNEES AND CUP HER KNEES GOOD
-GSIhHwFs04_6 0 GINA IS GOING TO TAKE A BIG INHALE IN AND THEN AS SHE EXHALES SHE IS GOING TO PRESS HER HANDS RIGHT DOWN INTO THE EARTH AND LIFT WILLIE UP GOOD
-GSIhHwFs04_7 0 WILLIE IS LENGTHENING THROUGH HIS LEGS AND PRESSING OUT THROUGH HIS TOES GINA REPRESENTING THE CONNECTION TO EARTH AND WILLIE REPRESENTING THE CONNECTION TO HEAVEN
-GSIhHwFs04_8 0 GOOD WILLIE NOW YOU WANT TO GENTLY LOWER DOWN GENTLY GENTLY GENTLY VERY SLOWLY BRING THE WEIGHT ON TO YOUR TOES AND THEN PRESS OFF OF GINA AND BACK
-GSIhHwFs04_9 0 GREAT JOB GUYS
H-JhEXmhK2U_1 0 OKAY WE'VE ALREADY PUT OUR STRIP OF DECORATOR PAPER ON AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO EMBOSS THE FLOWER ONE OF THESE BEAUTIFUL CHIPBOARD FLOWERS
H-JhEXmhK2U_2 0 I'M USING A LITTLE BIT OF CRAFT INK AND I'M USING AN ONLY ORANGE COLOR
H-JhEXmhK2U_3 0 I WANT THIS FLOWER TO REALLY POP OFF THE PAGE
H-JhEXmhK2U_4 0 SO THE FIRST THING I'M GOING TO DO AS YOU CAN SEE I'M JUST DABBING MY CRAFT INK AND THE REASON WE'RE USING THE CRAFT INK IS BECAUSE IT'S A THICKER INK AND IT WORKS VERY WELL WITH EMBOSSING
H-JhEXmhK2U_5 0 SO GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT A GOOD COAT AND ONCE IT'S COVERED
H-JhEXmhK2U_6 0 THESE ARE THE STAMPING SPOTS YOU'LL NOTICE THESE ARE A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN THE REGULAR INK SIZE PADS
H-JhEXmhK2U_7 0 I LIKE THESE FOR DOING THESE KIND OF PROJECTS BUT THEY ALSO COME IN THE LARGER STANDARD SIZE STAMPING PAD
H-JhEXmhK2U_8 0 SO ONCE I'VE GOT MY INK ALL OVER IT I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PUT IT IN MY TRAY AND I'M GOING TO POUR JUST A LITTLE BIT OF MY EMBOSSING POWDER ALL OVER IT AND AGAIN BY A LITTLE BIT I MEAN COVER IT
H-JhEXmhK2U_9 0 GIVE IT A LITTLE SHAKE SO WE CAN FIND IT AGAIN TAP IT OFF AND THEN I LIKE TO DUMP MY POWDER BACK IN AND I LIKE TO CLOSE IT UP BECAUSE IF I START WITH MY HEAT EMBOSSING TOOL SOMETIMES IT FLIES EVERYWHERE
H-JhEXmhK2U_10 0 SO THE NEXT THING I'M GOING TO DO IS JUST TAKE MY HEAT EMBOSSING TOOL AND START HEAT EMBOSSING IT
H-JhEXmhK2U_11 0 YOU'LL SEE THE COLOR START TO POP HERE IN JUST A SECOND
H-JhEXmhK2U_12 0 YOU WANT TO HOLD IT ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO THREE INCHES AWAY AND THERE'S THE COLOR STARTING TO GO
H-JhEXmhK2U_13 0 THEN ONCE IT STARTS I'M JUST GOING TO GRADUALLY MOVE IT AROUND UNTIL THE WHOLE FLOWER IS NICE AND SHINY AND BRIGHT
H-JhEXmhK2U_14 0 HEAT EMBOSSING IS A GREAT THING TO DO WITH ANY KIND OF CHIPBOARD
H-JhEXmhK2U_15 0 YOU CAN SEE THE COLOR REALLY COMING OUT
H-JhEXmhK2U_16 0 THIS FLOWER IS GOING TO MAKE A GREAT ACCENT ON MY MOTHER'S DAY BOARD HERE
H-JhEXmhK2U_17 0 AND THERE YOU HAVE IT A BEAUTIFUL FLOWER BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE MORE STEP TO MAKE IT EVEN BETTER
gqwDE8NtLoA_1 0 EMIL LAMPRECHT NOW THIS NEXT TRICK IS ANOTHER THAT'S GOOD TO UNDERSTAND THROUGH SIDE SWAPS
gqwDE8NtLoA_2 0 THE NOTATION IS 6616161
gqwDE8NtLoA_3 0 BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS FOR A SHORT TIME MAINTAINING THREE ON EACH HAND BUT CONSTANTLY SWITCHING BACK AND FORTH TO EACH HAND
gqwDE8NtLoA_4 0 I'LL DO IT ONE SIDE OF PATTERN FOR YOU TO SEE
gqwDE8NtLoA_5 0 AND SO ON
gqwDE8NtLoA_6 0 NOW THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS TRICK IS THAT IT TRANSITIONS VERY WELL INTO OTHER SIDE SWAPS
gqwDE8NtLoA_7 0 BECAUSE IT'S SIXES INSTEAD OF SEVENS OR FOURS IT HAS A NICE DIFFERENT LOOK THAN IF YOU WERE DOING A 7441 OR A 7401 OR A 741 WHICH ARE BOTH SIDE SWAPS I'LL GO OVER IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS
gqwDE8NtLoA_8 0 THE THINGS YOU WANT TO PRACTICE IN THIS MIGHT BE THREE BALLS ON ONE HAND SO YOU CAN GET USED TO THE HEIGHT AND TIMING REQUIRED TO THROW THE SIXES
gqwDE8NtLoA_9 0 THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT AND I DON'T SUGGEST THAT YOU PRACTICE IT TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE READY TO JUGGLE SIX BALLS BEFORE TRYING THIS TRICK BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO FLASH THREE BALLS ON ONE HAND TO REALLY DO THIS
gKnp9YoayJY_1 0 HI I'M MELINA AND WELCOME TO EXPERT VILLAGE
gKnp9YoayJY_2 0 TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A BEAUTIFUL NECKLACE OUT OF POLYMER CLAY
gKnp9YoayJY_3 0 IN THIS NEXT STEP WE ARE GOING TO ADD CLOSURE TO OUR NECKLACE
gKnp9YoayJY_4 0 BEFORE ADDING ANY CLOSURE YOU NEED CRIMPED BEADS
gKnp9YoayJY_5 0 CRIMPED BEADS ARE THE BEST INVENTION IN THE WORLD IN MY OPTION
gKnp9YoayJY_6 0 IT IS A GREAT WAY TO SEAL OFF ANY NECKLACE TO PREVENT THE CLOSURE FROM LOOSENING TO HOLD EVERYTHING INTO PLACE AND THEY ARE REALLY EASY TO APPLY
gKnp9YoayJY_7 0 ANYBODY CAN DO IT ALL YOU NEED IS A PAIR OF NEEDLE NOSE PLIERS
gKnp9YoayJY_8 0 THIS IS OUR CRIMP BEAD HERE IS OUR WIRE
gKnp9YoayJY_9 0 OUR WIRE IS GOING TO COME OUT THIS SIDE AND WE ARE GOING TO ATTACH THE WIRE TO A CLOSURE
gKnp9YoayJY_10 0 THE OTHER END OF THE WIRE IS GOING TO COME BACK INSIDE OF THE CRIMP BEAD
gKnp9YoayJY_11 0 THE CRIMP BEAD AS A LITTLE SLICE RIGHT HERE IT IS ACTUALLY A CYLINDER AND YOU CAN SEE WHERE IT WAY SLICED TOGETHER
gKnp9YoayJY_12 0 WE ARE GOING TO TAKE OUR NEEDLE NOSE PLIERS AND WE ARE GOING TO SQUEEZE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CRIMP BEAD SO THAT IT FOLDS IN HALF LIKE THIS
gKnp9YoayJY_13 0 YOU HAVE YOUR WIRE COMING OUT HERE AND THE CLOSURE RIGHT HERE
gKnp9YoayJY_14 0 ONCE THIS IS CLOSE YOU SQUEEZE IT TIGHT SO IT BECOMES FLAT AND THAT WAY IT HOLDS THE WIRE INTO PLACE
gdWQo8B51hY_1 0 THE DRINK WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE IS CALLED PJOLTER BAY
gdWQo8B51hY_2 0 LET'S GO AHEAD AND PUT SOME ICE IN A GLASS AND MEASURE OUT ONE OUNCE OF APRICOT BRANDY
gdWQo8B51hY_3 0 LET'S SEE IF WE CAN JUST SQUIRT THAT OUT OF THERE
gdWQo8B51hY_4 0 I THINK IT'S TIME FOR A NEW POUR SPOUT ON THAT ONE HUH
gdWQo8B51hY_5 0 NOW LET'S ADD ONE OUNCE OF GIN AND LET'S GO AHEAD AND ADD SOME GRENADINE THERE WE GO
gdWQo8B51hY_6 0 ADD ABOUT HALF AN OUNCE OF GRENADINE AND WE'LL FINISH IT UP WITH SOME FANTA
gdWQo8B51hY_7 0 IF YOU WANT YOU CAN USE AN ORANGE LEMON FANTA MIX OR ANY SODA IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE FANTA
gdWQo8B51hY_8 0 NOW LET'S JUST MIX THAT BACK AND FORTH COUPLE OF TIMES YOU DON'T WANT TO SHAKE IT WITH THE CARBONATION IN THE SODA YOU'LL HAVE PJOLTER BAY ALL OVER EVERYTHING
gdWQo8B51hY_9 0 NOW LET'S GO AHEAD AND POUR THAT IN AND ADD A STRAW ALRIGHT BOTTOMS UP
gT5Su9TcfGI_1 0 BID WHIST WITH KITTY AND JOKERS
gT5Su9TcfGI_2 0 THE RULES OF BID WHIST OF COURSE GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL GAME OF WHIST THAT WAS CREATED IN THE LATE SIXTEEN HUNDREDS EARLY SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS AND WRITTEN EXTENSIVELY BY EDMOND HOYLE JAMES CLAY AND OTHERS
gT5Su9TcfGI_3 0 JAMES CLAY WAS A CARD GAME WRITER FROM THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS AND HE WROTE A COMPLETE TETRIS ON BID WHIST AND WHIST IN GENERAL ABOUT EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR
gT5Su9TcfGI_4 0 UP UNTIL ABOUT NINETEEN TWENTY THE GAME OF WHIST THAT WAS PLAYED WAS PRETTY STANDARD
gT5Su9TcfGI_5 0 THE DETERMINATION OF TRUMP FOR EXAMPLE WAS NOT BY BIDDING BUT WAS BY THE BOTTOM CARD
gT5Su9TcfGI_6 0 SO IF THE HAND IS DEALT OUT AND SAY OKAY THAT'S TRUMP
gT5Su9TcfGI_7 0 WELL WHAT WAS VERY FRUSTRATING IS YOU PICK UP A BEAUTIFUL HAND THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS
gT5Su9TcfGI_8 0 I MEAN YOU MAY NOT TWELVE HEARTS
gT5Su9TcfGI_9 0 LET'S JUST SAY YOU HAD A NICE KILLER HEART SUIT FOR EXAMPLE AND SOME SIDE ACES
gT5Su9TcfGI_10 0 BUT THE DECK SAYS THAT'S TRUMP
gT5Su9TcfGI_11 0 WHERE'S THE SKILL
gT5Su9TcfGI_12 0 I MEAN YOU JUST GET COMPLETELY ROOKED OUT OF A GREAT HAND LIKE THAT
gT5Su9TcfGI_13 0 SO THEY DECIDED TO HAVE BIDDING
gT5Su9TcfGI_14 0 WHAT CAME OUT OF THAT WAS THE AFORE MENTIONED STRAIGHT WHIST
gT5Su9TcfGI_15 0 NOW ABOUT NINETEEN TWENTY OR SO A GROUP OF PLAYERS PRIMARILY IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY DECIDED TO INNOVATE THE GAME A LITTLE BIT AND ADD ON THE FACT THAT WE COULD MAKE THIS GAME WE COULD JAZZ THIS UP A LITTLE BIT
gT5Su9TcfGI_16 0 MAKE THIS A LOT MORE FUN MAKE THIS A LOT MORE COMPETITIVE
gT5Su9TcfGI_17 0 SO THEN THEY ADDED JOKERS
gT5Su9TcfGI_18 0 JOKERS WERE ALWAYS AROUND IN THE DECK AND JOKER IS A TERM WE TALKED ABOUT IN EUCHRE JUKER JOKER AND SO FORTH AND WAS ADDED TO THE DECK BY BICYCLE CARDS
gT5Su9TcfGI_19 0 A U.S PLAYING CARD COMPANY ABOUT EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
gT5Su9TcfGI_20 0 IF YOU LOOK AT A TYPICAL DECK OF CARDS YOU'LL SEE THERE IS A BIG JOKER AND A LITTLE JOKER
gT5Su9TcfGI_21 0 NOW SOME OF THE CUSTOM SPADES DECKS THAT BICYCLE MAKES HAPPEN TO HAVE NICE BIG THINGS THAT SAY BIG JOKER LITTLE JOKER BUT THESE WILL DO FINE
gT5Su9TcfGI_22 0 YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS ONE ON THE BICYCLE IS BIGGER THAN THIS ONE
gT5Su9TcfGI_23 0 THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCE THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BID WHIST AND STRAIGHT WHIST IS THE FACT THAT A YOU HAVE JOKERS THAT ARE TRUMP
gT5Su9TcfGI_24 0 THE BIG JOKER IS BIGGER THAN THE ACE OF SPADES AND THE LITTLE JOKER
gT5Su9TcfGI_25 0 THE LITTLE JOKER SUPERSEDES OR BIGGER THAN THE ACE OF SPADES BIGGER THAN THE ACE OF TRUMPS
gT5Su9TcfGI_26 0 SO IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT A TRUMP SUIT THAT WAS UPTOWN WE WOULD SEE THAT HERE'S THE RANKING
gT5Su9TcfGI_27 0 BIG JOKER LITTLE JOKER ACE KING QUEEN AND SO FORTH
gT5Su9TcfGI_28 0 THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO ARE THE FACT THAT YOU A JOKER AND A KITTY
gT5Su9TcfGI_29 0 A LOT OF HISTORY THAT CERTAINLY GOES BACK TO THE NINETEEN TWENTIES THIRTIES FORTIES FIFTIES AND IS PLAYED HUGE BID WHIST COMMUNITY
gT5Su9TcfGI_30 0 BID WHIST MEANING WITH KITTY AND JOKERS AND SO FORTH
gT5Su9TcfGI_31 0 ANOTHER ASPECT IS THAT IT IS THE SAME COMMUNITY OF AFRICAN AMERICAN PLAYERS WHO ALSO CREATED THE GAME OF SPADES
gT5Su9TcfGI_32 0 SO YOU HAD BID WHIST WITH KITTY AND JOKERS AND SPADES
gT5Su9TcfGI_33 0 VERY POPULAR IN THE LATE THIRTIES THROUGH OUT SECOND WORLD WAR AND THEN FROM THERE IT WENT TO THE COLLEGES AND OTHER PLACES
gT5Su9TcfGI_34 0 PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS HAD A GREAT TIME WITH THE GAME
gT5Su9TcfGI_35 0 GREAT RICH HISTORY
GbfVUIaWAew_1 0 THE FIRST THING YOU'RE GOING TO DO IN THE ACRYLIC APPLICATION IS TO JUST GO AHEAD WET YOUR BRUSH MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONOMER ON THERE
GbfVUIaWAew_2 0 IF YOU NEED TO JUST WIPE IT OFF
GbfVUIaWAew_3 0 MAKE SURE THERE'S NOTHING STUCK OR LEFT OVER FROM BEFORE
GbfVUIaWAew_4 0 THERE IS JUST TAKE YOUR PAPER TOWEL AND WIPE IT OFF A LITTLE
GbfVUIaWAew_5 0 YOU'RE GOING TO GET A SCOOP OR A BALL OF ACRYLIC POWDER OUT AND APPLY TO THE NAIL
GbfVUIaWAew_6 0 IF YOUR NAIL HAS ENOUGH MONOMER IT WILL WET THE POWDER IF IT DOESN'T YOU'LL NEED TO WIPE THAT ONE OFF AND START AGAIN
GbfVUIaWAew_7 0 JUST WANT TO PUT IT IN THE CENTER OF THE NAIL
GbfVUIaWAew_8 0 KIND OF PAT IT DOWN TOWARDS THE SIDES
GbfVUIaWAew_9 0 PUSH IT BACK TOWARDS THE TOP AND THEN PULL IT DOWN OFF OF THE NAIL ITSELF
GbfVUIaWAew_10 0 IF YOU HAVE EXTRA JUST KIND OF WIPE IT OFF
GbfVUIaWAew_11 0 YOU WANT TO GO AROUND THE CUTICLE WITH YOUR BRUSH JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A ONE SIXTEENTH OF AN INCH GAP SO THAT THE ACRYLIC IS NOT TOUCHING THE CUTICLE ITSELF
GbfVUIaWAew_12 0 IF YOU NEED TO GET A LITTLE MORE LIQUID AND POWDER
GbfVUIaWAew_13 0 PUT IT THE VERY TIP
GbfVUIaWAew_14 0 AND SMOOTH IT BACK
GbfVUIaWAew_15 0 AND WE'RE STARTING WITH THE RIGHT PINKIE NAIL
GbfVUIaWAew_16 0 NOW ONCE YOU'VE GOT YOUR ACRYLIC APPLIED LOOK AT IT FROM THE SIDE YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT FROM THE BOTTOM
GbfVUIaWAew_17 0 MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT ON THE CUTICLE
GbfVUIaWAew_18 0 MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A NICE C CURVE ON THE TOP AND IF YOU NEED TO APPLY A LITTLE MORE ANYWHERE YOU SEE FIT
GbfVUIaWAew_19 0 AND JUST KIND OF BLEND IT IN WITH THE REST
GbfVUIaWAew_20 0 AND THAT IS HOW YOU APPLY THE ACRYLIC TO THE RIGHT PINKIE NAIL
GbfVUIaWAew_21 0 AGAIN IF YOUR ACRYLIC IS TOO WET IT WILL RUN AND DRIP AND YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF AND START OVER
GLj7QwlHIKI_1 0 THE NEXT WE'RE GOING TO TIE IS THE ALBRIGHT KNOT
GLj7QwlHIKI_2 0 THIS KNOT IS USED FOR TYING TOGETHER LIKE FISHING LINES AND WHAT NOT OF A DIFFERENT DIAMETER
GLj7QwlHIKI_3 0 TO START YOU TAKE THE LARGER LINE AND CREATE A LOOP AND THEN YOU TAKE THE SMALLER LINE AND RUN IT THROUGH THIS WAY AWAY FROM THIS END OF THE LOOP
GLj7QwlHIKI_4 0 AND YOU SIMPLY TAKE IT UP AND BEGIN WRAPPING IT AROUND
GLj7QwlHIKI_5 0 YOU'LL WANT TO DO THIS SEVERAL TIMES LIKE EIGHT OR NINE
GLj7QwlHIKI_6 0 BUT SINCE THIS ROPE IS BIGGER THAN WHAT YOU'D ACTUALLY USE IT'S NOT FOR I'M JUST GOING TO DO IT A FEW TIMES SO YOU GET THE IDEA
GLj7QwlHIKI_7 0 I'M JUST WRAPPING IT AROUND THE WHOLE THING
GLj7QwlHIKI_8 0 KEEP THIS ROPE ON THIS SIDE
GLj7QwlHIKI_9 0 TO FINISH IT OFF YOU GO TO THE TOP YOU NOTICE HOW THESE ARE COMING OVER THIS WAY SIMILAR TO THE WAY THAT THE SQUARE KNOW WOULD
GLj7QwlHIKI_10 0 AND YOU JUST PULL IT DOWN AND TIGHTEN IT UP
GLj7QwlHIKI_11 0 AND THAT'S THE ALBRIGHT KNOT
ggc7CX2OZ6Q_1 0 GARY HAS A PRETTY GOOD SERVE RETURN DOWN THE WALL SO I'M GOING TO TRY TO FOX HIM HERE AND HIT A LOB SERVE
ggc7CX2OZ6Q_2 0 BECAUSE WHEN THE BALL COMES OFF A LOB IT'S GOING TO BE VERY STEEP SO HE'S NOT ABLE TO HIT IT AS POWERFULLY OR AS ACCURATELY IF I EXECUTE MY LOB SERVE WELL
ggc7CX2OZ6Q_3 0 SO SINCE I'M ON MY FOREHAND SIDE THIS IS THE BEST SIDE I HAVE TO HIT A LOB SERVE AND THE BACKHAND IS GENERALLY EACH PLAYER'S WEAKEST SHOT
ggc7CX2OZ6Q_4 0 SO I'M GOING TO GIVE GARY A GOOD LOB SERVE I HOPE AND SEE WHAT HE CAN DO WITH THEM
ggc7CX2OZ6Q_5 0 OKAY THAT'S PRETTY GOOD
ggc7CX2OZ6Q_6 0 THAT'S PRETTY GOOD
ggc7CX2OZ6Q_7 0 SO I'VE GOT TO GET A BETTER RETURN I'VE GOT TO GET A BETTER SERVE THAN THAT
ggc7CX2OZ6Q_8 0 NOW THAT ONE THAT ONE'S PRETTY TOUGH
ggc7CX2OZ6Q_9 0 SO THAT ONE FORCED A REASONABLY LOOSE RETURN WHICH IS WHAT I WANT
ggc7CX2OZ6Q_10 0 NOW THAT SERVE WAS NO GOOD BUT ITS RETURN WAS PRETTY TOUGH
ggc7CX2OZ6Q_11 0 OKAY SO YOU CAN SEE THE LOB SERVE TAKES A LOT OF PRACTICE
ggc7CX2OZ6Q_12 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE AN UP AND COMING SQUASH PLAYER A LOT OF THE OLDER GUYS HAVE THESE GREAT LOB SERVES AND THEY CAN FRUSTRATE THE UP AND COMING PLAYER
ggc7CX2OZ6Q_13 0 SO WORK ON YOUR LOB SERVE RETURN WITH A PRACTICE PARTNER SO YOU'LL GET TO WORK ON YOUR SERVE AND THE RETURN AND IT WILL REALLY HELP YOU IN THE LONG RUN
GGM9IPA8lzM_1 0 YOUR EDGES AND CORNERS YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR DOING THIS THE SAME
GGM9IPA8lzM_2 0 PUSH YOUR MUD IN TO EACH SO IT FULLS UP BEHIND IT
GGM9IPA8lzM_3 0 IF YOU GOT A LITTLE CRACK IN THERE YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO FILL THAT UP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
GGM9IPA8lzM_4 0 IT HELPS TO JOIN THE TWO PIECES OF DRYWALL TOGETHER
GGM9IPA8lzM_5 0 PRETTY MUCH GO OVER IT LIKE YOU DID ON THE EDGE
GGM9IPA8lzM_6 0 FILLING IN THE CRACK AND PUSHING YOUR MUD IN THERE
GGM9IPA8lzM_7 0 IF YOUR IN EXPERIENCED WITH THIS IT IS KIND OF HARD TO GET THIS SMOOTH AT FIRST BUT IF YOU KEEP WORKING WITH IT PRETTY SOON YOU WILL GET TO THE POINT WHERE IT WILL COME OUT REALLY SMOOTH
GGM9IPA8lzM_8 0 I KIND OF LIKE TO DO ON MY CORNERS ONE SIDE AT A TIME IF I AM USING FORTY MINUTE AND IF I CAN DO IT BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE USE CORNER TROWELS AND I DO SOMETIMES BUT A LOT TIMES I DON'T SIMPLE BECAUSE IT TAKES A LOT OF TIMES FOR ME TO STOP AND GRAB THE CORNER BEAD AND START USING IT AND ALL THAT
GGM9IPA8lzM_9 0 IT IS FASTER FOR ME TO GO BY HAND
GGM9IPA8lzM_10 0 IF I DO ONE SIDE AND I LET IT SET I CAN KNOCK OFF THE BUMPS ON THE OTHER SIDE AND I DON'T GET THAT GROOVE THAT YOU WILL GET IF YOU PUT A COAT ON THIS SIDE RIGHT NOW
GGM9IPA8lzM_11 0 IF YOU WERE TO PUT A COAT ON THIS SIDE AT THE SAME TIME THEN THE POINT OF YOUR KNIFE WOULD PRESS IN THERE ON THE EDGE AND IT WOULD MAKE A GROOVE THERE ALONG THE SIDE AND SOMETIMES MESSES UP YOUR A LITTLE BIT
GGM9IPA8lzM_12 0 SO WHEN I GET A CHANCE I WILL JUST DO ONE SIDE AND THEN I'LL COME BACK AFTER THIS SIDE HARDENS AND THEN DO THE OTHER SIDE LATER
GGM9IPA8lzM_13 0 EITHER WAY THOUGH IF YOU ARE CAREFUL AND YOU WANT TO BOTH SIDES AT THE SAME TIME YOU CAN STILL DO IT
hFFfvt-3xc4_1 0 YUU ASAKURA HI
hFFfvt-3xc4_2 0 MY NAME IS YUU ASAKURA AND YOU'RE WATCHING EXPERT VILLAGE
hFFfvt-3xc4_3 0 I'M TEACHING YOU PRACTICAL JAPANESE WHICH YOU CAN START USING TODAY
hFFfvt-3xc4_4 0 I MOVED OUT HERE SEVEN YEARS AGO FROM OSAKA JAPAN
hFFfvt-3xc4_5 0 I STUDIED LINGUISTICS WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE AND I'VE BEEN TUTORING FROM STUDENTS TO ADULTS WHO ARE TRAVELLING TO JAPAN AND I'VE BEEN WORKING AS A TRANSLATOR
hFFfvt-3xc4_6 0 AND I HOPE YOU LEARN SOME JAPANESE AND START USING IT
hFFfvt-3xc4_7 0 AND IN THE PREVIOUS SHOW WE LEARNED HOW TO GREET IN JAPANESE AND ALSO WE LEARNED SOME VERY USEFUL SENTENCES WHICH YOU CAN USE IN JAPAN
hFFfvt-3xc4_8 0 AND IN THIS SHOW I WANT YOU TO LEARN HOW TO DESCRIBE ABOUT YOU AND ABOUT THE PERSON AND ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS
hFFfvt-3xc4_9 0 I HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS SHOW AND LET'S START
gdhBPLzGw5Q_1 0 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KEEPING ORNAMENTAL FISH SINCE THE TIME OF THE ROMANS
gdhBPLzGw5Q_2 0 HI I'M BRUCE WITH AQUATEK TROPICAL IN AUSTIN TEXAS AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING THE BASICS OF FISH KEEPING
gdhBPLzGw5Q_3 0 OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED AN AQUARIUM SUITABLE STAND COVER AND LIGHT BUT YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF FISH YOU LIKE AND PICK AN AQUARIUM THAT WILL BE ABLE TO HOLD THEIR ADULT SIZE
gdhBPLzGw5Q_4 0 WHERE TO PUT THE AQUARIUM
gdhBPLzGw5Q_5 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT IT IN A HIGH TRAFFIC AREA THAT WILL STARTLE THE FISH ALL THE TIME OR WILL RECEIVE DIRECT SUNLIGHT WHICH IS WILL JUST RESULT IN UNDESIRABLE ALGAE GROWTH
gdhBPLzGw5Q_6 0 WHAT KIND OF FILTER WILL WORK BEST FOR YOUR FISH WHETHER A SIMPLE WATERFALL TYPE HANG ON THE BACK FILTER WILL WORK OR WHETHER YOU NEED THE EXTRA BIOLOGICAL CAPACITY OF A WET DRY FILTER
gdhBPLzGw5Q_7 0 YOU SHOULD ALSO FACTOR IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME YOU HAVE TO DEVOTE TO YOUR HOBBY AND DON'T GET IN OVER YOUR HEAD
gdhBPLzGw5Q_8 0 IF YOU ONLY HAVE TEN MINUTES A DAY TO INTERACT WITH YOUR PETS DON'T BUT A ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY GALLON REEF TANK
gdhBPLzGw5Q_9 0 KEEP IT SIMPLE AND HAVE FUN
gdhBPLzGw5Q_10 0 WELL THAT'S THE BASICS OF FISH KEEPING AND UNTIL NEXT TIME I'M BRUCE WITH AQUATEK IN AUSTIN
g_sUCNtQYGE_1 0 THE NEXT POINT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS STOMACH 36 OR THREE MILE RUN
g_sUCNtQYGE_2 0 IT'S JUST BELOW THE POINT WE JUST DID AND IT'S GOING TO BE AGAIN IN A MUSCLE BELLY JUST BELOW THE KNEE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE BONE
g_sUCNtQYGE_3 0 YOU'RE GOING TO RUN YOUR FINGERS DOWN FIND THAT HOLLOW SPACE
g_sUCNtQYGE_4 0 IT'S A LITTLE MORE CENTRAL ON THE LEG THAN THE ONE WE JUST DID
g_sUCNtQYGE_5 0 YOU'RE GOING TO HOLD THAT IN A STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN POSITION
g_sUCNtQYGE_6 0 AND THIS IS A GOOD ONE FOR TONIFYING THE CHI
g_sUCNtQYGE_7 0 SO ACTUALLY STRENGTHENING THAT ENERGY THAT LIFE FORCE THAT MOVES AROUND THE BODY AND MAKES MOTION EASY THAT KEEPS THE JOINT FLUID AND THAT SORT OF THING
g_sUCNtQYGE_8 0 THIS IS GOING TO BE AGAIN A STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN WOULD BE BEST
g_sUCNtQYGE_9 0 IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT JUST MASSAGING UP AND DOWN THROUGH THIS AREA WITH THE TIPS OF YOUR FINGER WILL CATCH BOTH OF THOSE POINTS AT THE SAME TIME
g_sUCNtQYGE_10 0 AGAIN YOU WANT TO DO BOTH SIDES BECAUSE QUITE OFTEN BOTH LEGS WILL BE AFFECTED IF THEY'RE HAVING TO FAVOR ONE LEG AS THEY'RE MOVING AROUND
g_sUCNtQYGE_11 0 SO YOU DO THE UP AND DOWN MORE OF A DOWNWARD MOTION JUST TO GET THAT ENERGY MOVING GET THE BODY MOVING
H9xycKoSgHM_1 0 HI I'M MATT CAIL AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M HERE TODAY TO SHOW YOU HOW TO THROW A HALLOWEEN PARTY FOR TEENAGERS
H9xycKoSgHM_2 0 WITH YOUR DAY SELECTED NOW YOU HAVE TO GET THE WORD OUT PEOPLE HAVE TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE HAVING A PARTY TO HAVE TO KNOW ALL THE DETAILS WHEN WHERE WELL THEY DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO KNOW HOW AND WHY
H9xycKoSgHM_3 0 BUT ALL THE REST THEY NEED TO KNOW AND THAT MEANS YOU NEED TO GET INVITATIONS OUT PRONTO
H9xycKoSgHM_4 0 THERE ARE A COUPLE OF WAYS YOU CAN DO THIS FIRST OFF YOU CAN SEND TRADITIONAL MAILED INVITATIONS OR DISADVANTAGES WITH THIS IS THAT YOU HAVE TO MAIL THEM OUT AND TAKES TIME
H9xycKoSgHM_5 0 IT TAKES LONGER FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK AND OPEN THEM AND RESPOND TO THEM AND IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO SEND INVITATIONS OUT REALLY EARLY OTHERWISE IT'S GOING TO BE TOO LATE PEOPLE WILL MAKE PLANS YOU'RE MORE THAN LIKELY GOING TO BE FACING COMPETITION
H9xycKoSgHM_6 0 IF YOU'RE TRYING TO HOLD A HALLOWEEN PARTY AND YOUR CLASS GETS THE WORD OUT EARLY EARLY OCTOBER THREE FOUR WEEKS IN ADVANCE FOR A HALLOWEEN PARTY THAT'S TARGETED TO TEENS IS THE BEST WAY TO GO
H9xycKoSgHM_7 0 ANY EARLIER THAN THAT IT'LL FOLLOW ANY SOCIAL RADAR THAT ANY LATER THAN THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH COMPETITION PEOPLES COUNTERS ARE ALREADY FILLED UP
H9xycKoSgHM_8 0 THE OTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO PAPER INVITATIONS IS USING WEBSITES THERE'S LOTS OF WEBSITES OUT THERE WHERE YOU CAN ALSO SEND INVITATIONS
H9xycKoSgHM_9 0 LIVING IN AN ELECTRONIC WORLD NOW WE CAN CERTAINLY SEND OUT INVITATIONS THIS WAY AND YOUR RESPONSE WILL BE QUICKER REMINDERS WILL BE EASIER AND IN GENERAL FOR THE YOUNGER GENERATION THEY'RE GOING TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE PROBABLY WITH THAT THAN A CARD
g5xecnY9uOo_1 0 HI THIS IS DEPUTY CHIEF HENRY WATSON WITH THE NEW BERN FIRE AND RESCUE IN NEW BERN NORTH CAROLINA
g5xecnY9uOo_2 0 IN THIS SESSION WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE THREE MAJOR TYPES OF FIRE EXTINGUISHERS AND THEIR ADVANTAGES
g5xecnY9uOo_3 0 THE FIRST TYPE OF FIRE EXTINGUISHER IS A WATER BASED FIRE EXTINGUISHER
g5xecnY9uOo_4 0 THE WATER BASED FIRE EXTINGUISHER CAN BE EASILY IDENTIFIED BY THE SILVER CAN THAT IT COMES IN
g5xecnY9uOo_5 0 SOME OF ITS ADVANTAGES ARE THAT IT ABSORBS LARGE AMOUNTS OF HEAT AND THE WATER IS READILY PLENTIFUL
g5xecnY9uOo_6 0 DRY CHEMICAL FIRE EXTINGUISHERS OR MULTIPURPOSE FIRE EXTINGUISHERS HAS A WORKING RANGE OF TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN FEET
g5xecnY9uOo_7 0 THE POWDER INSIDE THE EXTINGUISHER HAS A CONSISTENCY OF BAKING FLOUR SOME OF ITS ADVANTAGES IS THAT IT IS AN INERT MATERIAL AND CAN BE USED ON ELECTRICAL FIRES
g5xecnY9uOo_8 0 THE THIRD TYPE OF FIRE EXTINGUISHER IS A C02 FIRE EXTINGUISHER OR CARBON DIOXIDE
g5xecnY9uOo_9 0 SOME OF ITS ADVANTAGES ARE THAT IT HAS A HIGH EXPANSION RATIO AND THAT IT IS NON-CONDUCTIVE
g5xecnY9uOo_10 0 AND THESE ARE THE THREE MAJOR TYPES OF FIRE EXTINGUISHERS

gLMqBz685L4_1 0 HI MY NAME IS CHRIS FROM AQUATIC CENTRAL HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND ON THE WEB AT AQUATIC-CENTRAL.COM AND I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU HOW TO BUY KOI FISH FOR YOUR POND
gLMqBz685L4_2 0 NUMBER ONE IS MAKE SURE THAT YOUR POND IS SUITABLE FOR KOI AND YOUR WATER IS READY THAT IS IT'S CYCLED AND YOU'RE READY TO PLACE KOI INTO YOUR POND
gLMqBz685L4_3 0 THE NEXT THING IS FIND A SOURCE FOR YOUR KOI
gLMqBz685L4_4 0 WHEN YOU'VE FOUND A PLACE THAT HAS KOI GO AND INSPECT THE KOI
gLMqBz685L4_5 0 MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE HEALTHY
gLMqBz685L4_6 0 LOOK FOR SIGNS OF SICKNESS
gLMqBz685L4_7 0 LOOK FOR NORMAL SWIMMING AND BREATHING PATTERNS
gLMqBz685L4_8 0 LOOK FOR VIBRANT COLOR AND FINNAGE
gLMqBz685L4_9 0 WHAT TEMPERATURE ARE THEY BEING KEPT UNDER
gLMqBz685L4_10 0 IS SALT CURRENTLY BEING ADDED TO THE WATER
gLMqBz685L4_11 0 WHAT'S THE PH
gLMqBz685L4_12 0 KOI DEFINITELY PREFER A PH A LITTLE BIT HIGHER A LITTLE BIT ALKALINE APPROXIMATELY 7.2 7.4
gLMqBz685L4_13 0 THEY LIKE THE ADDITION OF A LITTLE BIT OF AQUARIUM SALT THAT IS NON-IODIZED SALT
gLMqBz685L4_14 0 GENERALLY MOST KOI SOLD IN STORES ARE GENERIC KOI
gLMqBz685L4_15 0 IF YOU ARE CURIOUS YOU MIGHT INQUIRE WHERE THEY COME FROM AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE HEALTHY OR FROM A REPUTABLE SOURCE
gLMqBz685L4_16 0 KOI DO REQUIRE SUFFICIENT FILTRATION AND OFTENTIMES KOI ARE KEPT OUTDOOR IN PONDS
gLMqBz685L4_17 0 HOWEVER THEY DO STILL REQUIRE A HEATED ENVIRONMENT APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT
gLMqBz685L4_18 0 WHEN THE TEMPERATURE DROPS BELOW THAT THEIR METABOLISM SLOWS DOWN AND THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM DROPS SO BE SURE TO KEEP A HEATED ENVIRONMENT FOR YOUR KOI
gLMqBz685L4_19 0 THOSE ADVANCED HOBBYISTS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR THE MORE EXPENSIVE KOI FISH
gLMqBz685L4_20 0 KOI FISH ARE QUITE POPULAR IN SOME CULTURES AND CAN FETCH EASILY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A BEGINNER KOI
gLMqBz685L4_21 0 THAT'S WHEN YOU START GETTING A SPECIFIC KOHAKU AND TANCHOED SPECIES
gLMqBz685L4_22 0 KOI ARE GENERALLY VIEWED FROM TOP DOWN AND THEY EACH HAVE A DISTINCT PATTERN WHICH WILL DISTINGUISH THEM
gLMqBz685L4_23 0 BE SURE BEFORE GETTING READY TO MAKE SUCH A PURCHASE TO REALLY DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE GETTING A TOP QUALITY KOI AND THIS IS HOW TO BUY A KOI FOR YOUR KOI FISH POND

H2XcsKUozc0_2 0 IN ORDER TO DO THAT THOUGH YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO SET SOME GOALS
H2XcsKUozc0_3 0 HI I'M JANI ROBERTS I'M A NATIONALLY CERTIFIED PERSONAL TRAINER AND ALSO A GRADUATE OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF NUTRITION
H2XcsKUozc0_4 0 AND I'M GOING TO SHARE SOME IDEAS WITH YOU AND MAKE SOME SUGGESTIONS AS TO HOW YOU CAN SET SOME WEIGHT LOSS GOALS THAT WILL WORK FOR YOU
H2XcsKUozc0_5 0 FIRST OF ALL YOU NEED A TIME FRAME
H2XcsKUozc0_6 0 AND THIS OF COURSE IS GOING TO BE BASED ON HOW MUCH WEIGHT IT IS THAT YOU NEED TO LOSE
H2XcsKUozc0_7 0 LET'S SAY YOU NEED TO LOSE FORTY POUNDS AND LETS BE REALISTIC LETS DO IT OVER FOUR MONTHS
H2XcsKUozc0_8 0 LET'S DO THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL SO YOU NEVER HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN AND YOU CAN KEEP THE WEIGHT OFF
H2XcsKUozc0_10 0 SO FIRST THIRTY DAYS OUR GOAL IS GOING TO BE BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTEEN POUNDS
H2XcsKUozc0_11 0 THOSE FIRST POUNDS ARE ALWAYS THE EASIEST TO LOSE
H2XcsKUozc0_12 0 AS WE GET CLOSER TO OUR GOAL WEIGHT IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CHALLENGING SO YOU'LL SEE THE GOAL REDUCE ACTUALLY AS THE PLAN MOVES FORWARD
H2XcsKUozc0_13 0 BY THE END OF SIXTY DAYS WE'VE LOST AN ADDITIONAL TEN TO TWELVE BY NINETY DAYS WE'VE LOST AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT TO TEN AND THEN BY THE TIME YOU'VE HIT THAT GOAL IN FOUR MONTHS YOU'LL BE UP TO YOUR GOAL WEIGHT AND YOU'LL HAVE LOST THE BALANCE OF POUNDS THAT YOU NEED TO LOSE

HEXxfkdN5kc_2 0 WELCOME TO EXPERT VILLAGE
HEXxfkdN5kc_3 0 MY NAME IS WAYNE PETERSEN AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE IMPORTANT BIRD AREAS PROGRAM FOR THE MASSACHUSETTS AUDUBON SOCIETY
HEXxfkdN5kc_4 0 TODAY WE'RE HERE AT THE DANIEL WEBSTER WILDLIFE SANCTUARY IN MARSHFIELD
HEXxfkdN5kc_5 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT BIRDING BY EAR
HEXxfkdN5kc_6 0 IN ADDITION TO SONGS AND CALL NOTES WHICH ARE VOCAL RENDITIONS VARIOUS BIRD SPECIES ALSO MAKE MECHANICAL SOUNDS
HEXxfkdN5kc_7 0 SOUNDS THAT ACTUALLY DON'T INVOLVE ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL VOCALIZATION
HEXxfkdN5kc_8 0 THE DRUMMING OF A WOODPECKER ON A HOLLOW SNAG FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE OF THING
HEXxfkdN5kc_9 0 BUT THERE ARE OTHERS
HEXxfkdN5kc_10 0 FOR INSTANCE VARIOUS BIRDS ESPECIALLY SHORE BIRDS OFTEN GIVE DISPLAYS IN THE AIR WHERE THE SOUND PASSING THROUGH VARIOUS PARTS OF EITHER THEIR WINGS OR THEIR TAILS CAN PRODUCE PECULIAR SOUNDS
HEXxfkdN5kc_11 0 THE AMERICAN WOODCOCK FOR EXAMPLE IS A BIRD THAT WHEN IT TAKES OFF IT HAS THIS SORT OF SOFT TWITTERING SOUND WHICH IS ACTUALLY MADE BY AIR PASSING THROUGH THE OUTER FLIGHT FEATHERS
HEXxfkdN5kc_12 0 SIMILARLY THE WILSON SNIPE WHEN IT'S DISPLAYING SPREADS ITS TAIL IN FLIGHT AND BASICALLY DOES A BRIEF FREE FALL WHICH CREATES THIS VERY PECULIAR WINNOWING SOUND
HEXxfkdN5kc_13 0 SOME OF THE GAME BIRDS SOME OF THE CHICKEN LIKE BIRDS WILL OFTEN DISPLAY AND THEY'LL TAP THEIR FEET ON THE GROUND IN ADDITION TO MAKING VARIOUS GESTURES WITH THEIR WINGS THAT ARE INTERESTING IN THIS REGARD
HEXxfkdN5kc_14 0 SO THERE ARE LOTS OF SOUNDS OTHER THAN STRICT VOCALIZATIONS THAT CAN BE USED FOR SOME OF THE SAME FUNCTIONS THAT WE FIND IN TERMS OF TRUE SONGS AND CALLS
HGhu4WH0NNg_2 0 THIS IS JON ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE

HGhu4WH0NNg_6 0 TO SET OUR BEVEL WE NEED TO TAKE AN ALLEN WRENCH AND LOOSEN THIS ALLEN HEAD SCREW IN THE BOTTOM
HGhu4WH0NNg_7 0 NOW THAT WE HAVE LOOSENED THAT SCREW WE CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOK AT OUR BEVEL GAGE AND WE CAN TILT OUR SHOE TO ANY ANGLE THAT WE WANT BETWEEN ZERO AND 45 DEGREES GOING EITHER WAY
HGhu4WH0NNg_8 0 ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR DESIRED ANGLE SET YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TIGHTEN THAT ALLEN HEAD SCREW

GgAh7XwkAlo_1 0 IN THIS CLIP I WILL BE EXPLAINING HOW TO CAPTURE VIDEO FROM THE VCR THROUGH A CAMCORDER AND INTO YOUR COMPUTER
GgAh7XwkAlo_2 0 SO NOW WE ARE GOING TO TAKE FOOTAGE FROM YOUR VCR AND INPUT IT INTO YOUR CAMCORDER
GgAh7XwkAlo_3 0 NEXT THE CAMCORDER WILL SEND IT TO YOUR COMPUTER
GgAh7XwkAlo_4 0 THE CABLE THAT YOU'LL NEED FIRST IS A FIRE WIRE CABLE WHICH IS STANDARD FOR CAPTURING FOOTAGE FROM YOUR CAMCORDER
GgAh7XwkAlo_5 0 SO YOU SHOULD ALREADY HAVE THAT
GgAh7XwkAlo_6 0 YOU'LL PLUG THAT INTO THE FIRE WIRE CARD IN YOUR COMPUTER
GgAh7XwkAlo_7 0 ONE END OF THE PLUG GOES INTO THE COMPUTER AND THE OTHER ONE OBVIOUSLY GOES INTO THE VCR
GgAh7XwkAlo_8 0 THEN YOU WILL NEED THE CABLE THAT CAME WITH YOUR CAMCORDER WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE ALREADY USED TO PLAY FOOTAGE FROM YOUR CAMCORDER ON YOUR TV
GgAh7XwkAlo_9 0 HOWEVER IT IS ALSO USED TO PUT FOOTAGE BACK INTO YOUR CAMERA
GgAh7XwkAlo_10 0 IN THIS CASE PUT IT INTO YOUR CAMERA WHICH WILL THEN SEND IT RIGHT BACK OUT
GgAh7XwkAlo_11 0 WE'LL PUT THAT RIGHT INTO THE CAMERA AND THEN PLUG THE VIDEO WHICH IS THE YELLOW COMPOSITE INTO THE VCR VIDEO OUT
GgAh7XwkAlo_12 0 THEN WE'LL PUT THE PLUG INTO AUDIO OUT
GgAh7XwkAlo_13 0 THIS VCR ONLY HAS ONE AUDIO OUT INSTEAD OF TWO SO WE'LL JUST PLUG ONE OF THEM IN
GgAh7XwkAlo_14 0 THE WHITE PLUG GOES INTO THE AUDIO OUT
GgAh7XwkAlo_15 0 NOW THE VIDEO AND AUDIO ARE BEING SENT TO THE CAMERA DIGITIZED AND BACK OUT INTO THE COMPUTER
GgAh7XwkAlo_16 0 ONE THING TO REMEMBER WHEN USING THE CAMCORDER IS TO DIGITIZE YOUR FOOTAGE FROM THE VCR
GgAh7XwkAlo_17 0 ALSO CHECK THE VIEWING SCREEN IN ORDER TO SEE THAT YOU CAN SEE YOUR FOOTAGE
GgAh7XwkAlo_18 0 IF YOU CAN'T SEE IT THAT MOST LIKELY MEANS THAT IT IS NOT COMING THROUGH YOUR CAMCORDER
GgAh7XwkAlo_19 0 YOU MAY HAVE THE VIDEO INPUTS SET TO OUTPUTS OR THE HEADPHONE JACK
GgAh7XwkAlo_20 0 SO YOU SHOULD CHECK YOUR CAMERA MANUAL TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHY IT IS NOT WORKING AND SOLVE THAT PROBLEM
GgAh7XwkAlo_21 0 THEN YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND CAPTURE
GiRzN2I8XeQ_1 0 SUPTA PADANGUSTHASANA III OR C ONCE AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO USE THE STRAPS TO MAKE THIS POSE JUST A LITTLE MORE AVAILABLE AND JUST BE ABLE TO GET HER TO GO A LITTLE DEEPER INTO HER POSE

hBp4Y-rDlvk_11 0 IT'LL TAKE ABOUT THREE MAYBE FOUR MINUTES
hBp4Y-rDlvk_12 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO COOK TUNA SUPER WELL DONE
hBp4Y-rDlvk_13 0 IT CAN BE A LITTLE PINK IN THE CENTER
hBp4Y-rDlvk_15 0 THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT
hBp4Y-rDlvk_16 0 WE WILL COOK IT PROBABLY JUST ABOUT WELL
hBp4Y-rDlvk_17 0 WE DON'T WANT TO GO ANY FURTHER PAST THAT OTHERWISE THE TUNA WILL TEND TO DRY OUT
hBp4Y-rDlvk_18 0 SO OUR TUNA'S WORKING
hBp4Y-rDlvk_19 0 OUR GARLIC IS BROWNING
hBp4Y-rDlvk_20 0 THE PAN'S NICE AND HOT
hBp4Y-rDlvk_21 0 NOW WHEN YOU COOK THE CUCUMBER SPAGHETTI YOU JUST PRETTY MUCH WANT TO FLASH IT IN THE PAN
hBp4Y-rDlvk_22 0 IF YOU COOK IT TOO LONG IT'LL BE TOO LIMP IT'LL LOSE ITS COLOR
hBp4Y-rDlvk_23 0 SO THERE WE GO
hBp4Y-rDlvk_24 0 I'M GOING TO ADD A LITTLE MORE BUTTER
hBp4Y-rDlvk_25 0 NOW NORMALLY I WOULD SAY ADJUST THE SEASONINGS WITH SALT AND PEPPER
hBp4Y-rDlvk_26 0 WITH THIS I'M NOT GOING TO
hBp4Y-rDlvk_27 0 WE'RE JUST GOING TO LEAVE IT WITH THE BUTTER AND GARLIC
hBp4Y-rDlvk_28 0 THERE'S PLENTY OF FLAVOR BETWEEN THE TUNA AND THE SAUCE
hBp4Y-rDlvk_29 0 YOU DON'T NEED TO ADD ANYTHING ELSE
hBp4Y-rDlvk_30 0 SO I'M GOING TO CRANK UP THE HEAT HERE JUST TO FLASH THIS
hBp4Y-rDlvk_31 0 BY THE TIME THIS IS DONE THE TUNA WILL BE DONE AND WE'LL BE READY FOR PLATING
hBp4Y-rDlvk_33 0 IT'S HOT THAT'S GOOD
hBp4Y-rDlvk_35 0 SO THIS IS READY
hBp4Y-rDlvk_36 0 DON'T WANT TO COOK IT ANYMORE THAN THAT
hBp4Y-rDlvk_37 0 I'M GOING TO CUT THE HEAT OFF
hBp4Y-rDlvk_38 0 NOW THE TUNA I WOULD SAY WOULD BE CLOSE
hBp4Y-rDlvk_39 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS TAKE A PEEK INSIDE
hBp4Y-rDlvk_41 0 WE'LL TAKE A LOOK
hBp4Y-rDlvk_43 0 AND IF YOU HAVE TO DO THIS JUST CUT IN AN AREA WHERE YOU'LL BE ADDING THE SAUCE
hBp4Y-rDlvk_44 0 IT'S STILL PINK INSIDE SO WE'LL LET IT ROLL FOR ABOUT ANOTHER MINUTE OR TWO
hBp4Y-rDlvk_45 0 REMEMBER IF YOU HAVE TO LOOK INSIDE TO CHECK FOR DONENESS DO IT WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO ADD THE SAUCE
hBp4Y-rDlvk_46 0 THAT WAY YOU CAN COVER IT UP AND NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW
gfV3V8AK42A_1 0 HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
gfV3V8AK42A_2 0 ONE OF THE FUN THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH LINEBACKERS IS CALLED TO STUNT OR TO BLITZ
gfV3V8AK42A_3 0 THAT MEANS WE'LL TAKE OUR LINEBACKERS AND PUT THEM ON AN ALL OUT RUN THROUGH THE LINE TO TRY TO STOP THE PLAY IN THE BACKFIELD WITH THE RUNNING BACK OR TO TRY TO GET TO A QUARTERBACK
gfV3V8AK42A_4 0 YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR DECISION
gfV3V8AK42A_5 0 WHEN YOU CALL BLITZ YOU'RE SELLING THIS GUY OUT
gfV3V8AK42A_6 0 HE NO LONGER HAS HIS GAP RESPONSIBILITIES
gfV3V8AK42A_7 0 HE NO LONGER HAS TO READ THE PLAY AND REACT TO THE PLAY
gfV3V8AK42A_8 0 HE HAS ONE JOB
gfV3V8AK42A_9 0 THAT JOB IS TO GO AS HARD AS HE POSSIBLY CAN THROUGH THE GAP AND TRY TO GET TO THAT QUARTERBACK AND MAKE A STOP IN THE BACKFIELD
gfV3V8AK42A_10 0 THE FIRST THING WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE STUNT
gfV3V8AK42A_11 0 THE STUNT IS SHOWING WHEN YOU HAVE A DEFENSIVE LINEMAN DOWN IN HIS STANCE YOU'RE GOING TO BRING YOUR LINEBACKERS UP AND SHOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BLITZ
gfV3V8AK42A_12 0 THEY'RE GOING TO COME UP REAL QUICK
gfV3V8AK42A_13 0 SOMETIMES YOU CAN STUNT AND DROP THEM BACK
gfV3V8AK42A_14 0 SOMETIMES YOU STUNT THEM AND THEN BLITZ THEM
gfV3V8AK42A_15 0 THE FIRST THING WE'LL SHOW IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO STUNT UP INTO THE HOLES VIDEO DEMO
gfV3V8AK42A_16 0 THEY'RE GOING TO STUNT UP THEY'RE GOING TO BE READY AND THEN THEY CAN RETURN BACK
gfV3V8AK42A_17 0 THE NEXT THING IS CALLED A STUNT INTO A BLITZ VIDEO DEMO
gfV3V8AK42A_18 0 THAT'S A STUNT TO A BLITZ
gfV3V8AK42A_19 0 THE LAST THING WE HAVE IS THE ALL OUT BLITZ
gfV3V8AK42A_20 0 THAT MEANS THE LINEBACKERS MAKE THE DECISION TO GO ALL OUT THROUGH VIDEO DEMO
gfV3V8AK42A_21 0 THEY ARE GOING AS HARD AS THEY CAN TO GET INTO THE BACKFIELD
gfV3V8AK42A_22 0 MOST OF THE TIME YOU WILL NOT BLITZ BOTH LINEBACKERS
gfV3V8AK42A_23 0 YOU'LL EITHER BLITZ UP THE MIDDLE OR YOU'LL BLITZ FROM THE RIGHT OR YOU'LL BLITZ FROM THE LEFT
gfV3V8AK42A_24 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO WASTE ALL THOSE GUYS IF THEY DON'T GET TO THE QUARTERBACK
gfV3V8AK42A_25 0 THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL A STUNT AND A BLITZ
GdGc3UJzHlo_1 0 TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO BAIT FISH
GdGc3UJzHlo_2 0 O K THIS IS GOING TO BE OUR VICTIM FOR TODAY OUR VOLUNTEER WE DIDN'T WANT TO USE A LIVE ONE TODAY
GdGc3UJzHlo_3 0 O.K BASICALLY THERE ARE A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN HOOK A BAIT FISH
GdGc3UJzHlo_4 0 THE MOST POPULAR WAY IS THROUGH THE DORSAL FIN RIGHT BEHIND THE DORSAL FIN WHICH IS THIS IS THE DORSAL FIN RIGHT HERE
GdGc3UJzHlo_5 0 AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR HOOK AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IT RIGHT BEHIND THE DORSAL FIN
GdGc3UJzHlo_6 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TOO HIGH ON THE BACK BONE BECAUSE IF DO YOU'RE GOING TO PARALYZE THE FISH AND IT'S JUST GOING TO BE STATIONARY
GdGc3UJzHlo_7 0 SO YOU'RE JUST GOING TO FEED IT THROUGH COME RIGHT UP AND THAT'S HOW YOU RIG A BAIT FISH
GdGc3UJzHlo_8 0 AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO WHICH IS NOT VERY POPULAR YOU HOOK IT THROUGH THE LIPS IN THE FRONT
GdGc3UJzHlo_9 0 YOU COME UP ON THE BOTTOM AND COME RIGHT OUT THE TOP
gVGhYe0wUYI_1 0 THE FRONTSIDE NOSEBLUNT SLIDE
gVGhYe0wUYI_2 0 THE FRONTSIDE NOSEBLUNT SLIDE IS WHEN YOU OLLIE OVER A LEDGE ROLLING UP TO IT IN A FRONTSIDE POSITION AND LAND ONLY ON YOUR NOSE AND YOUR TWO FRONT WHEELS SLIDE ACROSS THE TOP AND THEN POP OUT STRAIGHT AND ROLL AWAY
gVGhYe0wUYI_3 0 WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS SET UP IN THE OLLIE POSITION WITH YOUR FEET READY TO CREEP UP IN THE NOSE POSITION IN THE AIR SO THAT YOU CAN LAND IN THE NOSEBLUNT SLIDE
gVGhYe0wUYI_4 0 AFTER YOU'VE OLLIED OVER THE BEGINNING OF THE LEDGE YOU WANT TO GO OVER THE TOP LAND ON TOP OF THE LEDGE PUTTING ALL THE PRESSURE RIGHT HERE AND HANGING YOUR NOSE JUST OVER THE TIP OF THE LEDGE ITSELF
gVGhYe0wUYI_5 0 SLIDING ON YOUR TWO FRONT WHEELS KEEPING YOUR WEIGHT ON THE FRONT OF THE BOARD AND THEN AS SOON AS YOUR SLIDE IS DONE AND YOUR SPEED'S GONE YOU WANT TO POP YOUR BOARD OUT KIND OF LIKE A NOLLIE
gVGhYe0wUYI_6 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DRAG YOUR FOOT UP PUT PRESSURE ON THE NOSE POP OUT AND MAKE SURE YOUR WHEELS CLEAR THE TOP OF THE OBSTACLE
gVGhYe0wUYI_7 0 LAND AND ROLL AWAY STRAIGHT
gVGhYe0wUYI_8 0 THE NOSEBLUNT SLIDE IS A GREAT VARIATION TO LEARN BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE ONLY TRICKS WHERE YOU'RE ACTUALLY ON TOP OF SOMETHING AND SLIDING ACROSS IT WITH YOUR ENTIRE BOARD ON THE TOP
gVGhYe0wUYI_9 0 SOME TIMES YOU CAN PICTURE THE NOSEBLUNT SLIDE AS BEING A NOSE SLIDE LIKE THIS BUT ON ANOTHER PLANE ON THE VERTICAL PLANE AND SLIDING YOUR NOSESLIDE OR THE NOSEBLUNT SLIDE AS IT'S CALLED WHEN YOU DO IT THAT WAY AND POPPING IT OUT
gVGhYe0wUYI_10 0 AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO A FRONTSIDE NOSEBLUNT SLIDE
GWnPJ-kSeJQ_1 0 HI I'M CANDI CANE CANNCEL WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
GWnPJ-kSeJQ_2 0 WE ALREADY DONE A BUTTONHOLE BY THE MACHINE NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO ATTACH A BUTTON WITH THE MACHINE
GWnPJ-kSeJQ_3 0 SO THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS SWITCH OUT YOUR BUTTONHOLE FOOT FOR YOUR BUTTON FOOT
GWnPJ-kSeJQ_4 0 THIS IS A SMALL BUTTON FOOT THAT COMES WITH MOST MACHINES AND FROM MY EXPERIENCE WITH TEACHING AND SEWING NONE OF MY STUDENTS HAD ANY IDEA WHAT THIS IS
GWnPJ-kSeJQ_5 0 SO IF YOU DO HAVE A LITTLE FOOT THAT COMES WITH YOUR MACHINE THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS WELL THAT'S WHAT IT IS FOR
GWnPJ-kSeJQ_6 0 IS TO ACTUALLY ATTACH BUTTONS TO YOUR GARMENT
GWnPJ-kSeJQ_7 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEW THEM BY HAND
GWnPJ-kSeJQ_8 0 SO YOU JUST WANT TO SWITCH OUT YOUR FOOT PUT IN YOUR BUTTONHOLE FOOT WITH THE OPENING FACING THE FRONT
GWnPJ-kSeJQ_9 0 YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR BUTTON AND WHAT I FIND THAT IS REALLY EASY TRICK THAT WORKS ESPECIALLY WITH INEXPENSIVE BUTTONS
GWnPJ-kSeJQ_10 0 IS TO ACTUALLY TAPE YOU BUTTON ON THIS WAY IT DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE WHEN YOU STITCH IT
GWnPJ-kSeJQ_11 0 JUST PUT A SMALL PIECE OF SCOTCH TAPE DOWN IN THE POSITION AND YOU TAKE IT TO THE MACHINE JUST LINE IT UP RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE FOOT
GWnPJ-kSeJQ_12 0 YOU ARE GOING TO PUT IT ON THE SECOND STEP OF YOUR BUTTONHOLE THE SECOND OR THE FOURTH STEP WHICH IS THE SAME OF YOUR FOURTH STEP BUTTONHOLE
GWnPJ-kSeJQ_13 0 JUST MANUALLY YOU WANT TO LINE UP THE HOLE BECAUSE WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS YOU ARE BASICALLY STITCHING INTO THE LITTLE HOLES
GWnPJ-kSeJQ_14 0 YOU ARE GOING TO BE STITCHING BACK AND FORTH
hBIGDm-BdbI_1 0 SO HE IS NOW GOING TO BE DEMONSTRATING A SORT OF A SWING TO THE SIDE
hBIGDm-BdbI_2 0 THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER ABOUT THIS IS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE ATTACKING THE GROIN MUSCLE WITH THIS SWING A LITTLE
hBIGDm-BdbI_3 0 SO IT IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WHEN YOU FIRST START THIS KIND OF STRETCHING THAT YOU ARE VERY CAREFUL WITH IT
hBIGDm-BdbI_4 0 BECAUSE IF YOUR GROIN MUSCLES AREN'T USED TO IT YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T STRAIN THEM AT ALL
hBIGDm-BdbI_5 0 SO HE IS GOING TO PUT HIS HAND OUT TO BE A TARGET FOR HIS KICK
hBIGDm-BdbI_6 0 AND HE IS JUST GOING TO SWING HIS LEG UP STRAIGHT
hBIGDm-BdbI_7 0 HE IS GOING TO START OFF EASY AT FIRST
hBIGDm-BdbI_8 0 HE IS GOING TO BRING IT UP TAP AND COME BACK DOWN AGAIN
hBIGDm-BdbI_9 0 IT IS IMPORTANT TO START WITH YOUR GOAL TO BE LOW AND THEN KIND OF WORK YOUR WAY HIGHER AND HIGHER DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN DO
hBIGDm-BdbI_10 0 SO GO AHEAD KEEP GOING
hBIGDm-BdbI_11 0 AND AS WE DID FOR OUR FRONT KICKS YOU WOULD DO ABOUT A SET OF FIFTEEN
hBIGDm-BdbI_12 0 AND YOU ARE ASKING A WEAKER MUSCLE GROUP THE MUSCLES ON THE SIDES TO LIFT THE LEG IN A MORE DIFFICULT POSITION
hBIGDm-BdbI_13 0 SO WE ARE GOING TO ABBREVIATE THIS A LITTLE BIT
hBIGDm-BdbI_14 0 GOING TO GO OTHER SIDE
hBIGDm-BdbI_15 0 SO WE ARE ASSUMING HE DID FIFTEEN
hBIGDm-BdbI_17 0 AND JUST SWINGING THE LEG UP
hBIGDm-BdbI_18 0 AND AGAIN THESE ARE THIS IS SLIGHTLY MORE NATURAL WAY TO EMPLOY THE MUSCLES LIKE YOU WOULD REALLY EMPLOY THEM FOR DOING REAL SIDE KICKS IN THE STREET
hBIGDm-BdbI_19 0 ME PERSONALLY I USUALLY TRY TO DO THREE SETS OF THESE
hBIGDm-BdbI_20 0 SOMETIMES IF I NEED TO I'LL SWITCH BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE FRONT KICKS AND SIDEKICKS
hBIGDm-BdbI_21 0 SOMETIMES I WILL STICK WITH ONE FOR AWHILE
hBIGDm-BdbI_22 0 THE NEXT ONE HE IS GOING TO DO GOING AHEAD AND TURN SIDEWAYS IS HE HAS TO STRETCH OUT THE QUADS AND MUSCLES ON THE FRONT OF THE LEGS
hBIGDm-BdbI_23 0 SO WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO IS HE IS GOING TO STEP HIS RIGHT FOOT FORWARD AND THEN HE IS GOING TO SWING HIS LEG BACK TRYING TO KICK HIMSELF IN THE REAR END WITH HIS HEEL
hBIGDm-BdbI_25 0 WHEN HE DOES HE IS GOING TO ARCH HIS BACK A LITTLE BIT AS HE DOES THIS SWING
hBIGDm-BdbI_26 0 HE IS TRYING TO GET A GOOD STRETCH OUT OF THIS LEG SWING
hBIGDm-BdbI_27 0 EACH TIME TRYING TO GET THE KNEE FAR BEHIND THE HIP
hBIGDm-BdbI_31 0 SWING IT BACK KICK THE FOOT UP
hBIGDm-BdbI_33 0 NOTICE THE WHOLE TIME HE IS RELAXED
hBIGDm-BdbI_34 0 SO IF YOU ARE DOING THIS IN THE MORNING IT IS NOT TOO DIFFICULT TO DO IF YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT TIRE YOUR MUSCLES ARE A LITTLE BIT TIGHT
hBIGDm-BdbI_35 0 AND AGAIN IF YOU CHOOSE TO TRY TO DO THESE AND MIX THEM UP FRONT KICK SIDE KICK SORT OF BACK SWING RIGHT HERE YOU CAN DO THAT IF YOU LIKE TO MIX IT UP A LITTLE BIT
hBIGDm-BdbI_36 0 ME PERSONALLY A LOT OF TIMES I WILL KEEP IT ALL TOGETHER
hBIGDm-BdbI_37 0 AND WHEN YOU HAVE BLENDED ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER THEN IT TENDS TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WARM UP BECAUSE YOU ARE TAKING THIS LIMB AND YOU ARE SWINGING IT ALL OVER THE PLACE
GE93o9JEgAs_2 0 I'M LILLIAN WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THE SUPPLIES THAT YOU'LL NEED TO DO A DO IT YOURSELF PEDICURE
GE93o9JEgAs_3 0 FIRST YOU WOULD NEED A TOWEL TO PUT UNDERNEATH THE BASIN THAT YOU WOULD BE SOAKING YOUR FEET IN
GE93o9JEgAs_4 0 THAT IS JUST TO PROTECT THE FLOOR
GE93o9JEgAs_5 0 YOU ARE GOING TO NEED A NAIL FILER AND EMERY BOARD A NAIL BUFF A HEEL PUMICE STONE OR A HEEL SCRAPER EITHER ONE WOULD DO
GE93o9JEgAs_6 0 DON'T NEED BOTH
GE93o9JEgAs_7 0 A CUTICLES PUSHER I HAVE THREE TYPES RIGHT HERE NAIL CLIPPERS CUTICLES CLIPPERS YOU WOULD ALSO NEED YOUR POLISHES THE SHADE THAT YOU DESIRE THE BASE COAT AND YOUR TOP COAT
GE93o9JEgAs_8 0 IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO A FRENCH PEDICURE I WOULD EXPLAIN THAT AS WE GO ALONG YOU ARE GOING TO NEED A NAIL BRUSH AND YOUR GOING TO NEED YOUR DECALS AND A TWEEZER AND THAT TWO I WILL EXPLAIN AS WE GO ALONG
GE93o9JEgAs_9 0 IF YOU HAVE OLD POLISH ON YOUR GOING TO NEED POLISH NAIL POLISH REMOVER SOME COTTON CUTICLES SOFTENER AND A GOOD IDEA IS TO USE EPSOM SALT THAT SOFTENS THE DRY SKIN AS YOU SOAK
GE93o9JEgAs_10 0 THIS IS FOR THE SOAK
GE93o9JEgAs_11 0 AND THOSE ARE THE SUPPLIES THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO GET STARTED
g77gf-Uy_-s_1 0 HI EVERYBODY I'M JOHN GRADEN FROM THE MARTIAL ARTS TEACHER'S ASSOCIATION AND JOHNGRADEN.COM
g77gf-Uy_-s_2 0 THIS IS THE BACK LEG SIDE KICK
g77gf-Uy_-s_3 0 I LOVE TO KICK
g77gf-Uy_-s_4 0 TWO WAYS TO DO IT
g77gf-Uy_-s_5 0 ONE FORM TRADITIONAL WHERE WE ARE GOING TO LOCK IT OUT SHOW THE LINES DEMONSTRATE OUR TECHNIQUE THAT'S WHAT TRADITIONAL KARATE IS
g77gf-Uy_-s_6 0 IT IS A DEMONSTRATION OF ANCIENT TECHNIQUES
g77gf-Uy_-s_7 0 WE DO THEM AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE TO HONOR THE ARTS AND I LOVE THAT
g77gf-Uy_-s_8 0 THE OTHER WAY TO THROW IT IS MORE PRACTICAL AND A FIGHTING SCENARIO WHERE WE ARE NOT GOING TO HOLD IT OUT AND WE ARE GOING TO FIRE IT AND RECOVER SO HERE IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
g77gf-Uy_-s_9 0 WHEN I THROW A BACK LEG SIDE KICK I'M GOING TO COME RIGHT AT YOU WITH IT SO GET READY
g77gf-Uy_-s_10 0 I AM GOING TO BRING THE KNEE RIGHT UNDER MY BODY AND ONCE IT COMES ACROSS THIS FOOT HAS TO PIVOT HARD AND FAR
g77gf-Uy_-s_11 0 IDEALLY IT IS GOING TO GO 180
g77gf-Uy_-s_12 0 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
g77gf-Uy_-s_13 0 TOES ARE POINTED FORWARD NOW THE HEEL FACES YOU AND THAT IS A 180 PIVOT IT GOES ALL THE WAY AROUND
g77gf-Uy_-s_14 0 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A 180 160 OR 170 IS FINE BUT SHOOT FOR A 180
g77gf-Uy_-s_15 0 SO WHAT I AM DOING NOW IS I AM GOING TO BRING THE KNEE ACROSS MY BODY AND THEN THRUST IT STRAIGHT INTO YOU WITH THE BACK LEG SIDE KICK
g77gf-Uy_-s_16 0 I AM HITTING WITH THE HEEL MOST BEGINNERS RATHER THAN BRINGING IT ACROSS AND KICKING STRAIGHT OUT THEY WILL NOT GET IT ACROSS AIM THE SHIN AND END UP DOING A SLOPPY ROUNDHOUSE KICK
g77gf-Uy_-s_17 0 YOU KNOW BETTER THAN TO DO THAT SO I'M GOING TO BRING THE KNEE ACROSS THRUST IT OUT AND THEN BRING IT RIGHT BACK TO ME
g77gf-Uy_-s_18 0 STRAIGHT OUT AND STRAIGHT BACK
g77gf-Uy_-s_20 0 SHOULDERS ARE RELAXED THE SHOULDER IS GOING TO COME ALL THE WAY THROUGH BACK LEG SIDE KICK
g77gf-Uy_-s_21 0 AS THIS LEG IS COMING THROUGH I WANT TO TAKE THIS FOREARM AND LEAD WITH IT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET HIT IN THE STOMACH WITH HIS SIDE KICK ON THE WAY IN
g77gf-Uy_-s_22 0 SEE THIS IS A BIG MOVE THAT CAN BE A REALLY WIDE OPEN TARGET
g77gf-Uy_-s_23 0 SO AS I AM DOING THIS TECHNIQUE I AM PROTECTING AGAINST A POTENTIAL COUNTER ATTACK BY KEEPING MY ELBOW IN THE CENTER SO I AM HERE STRAIGHT THROUGH BACK LEG SIDE KICK
g77gf-Uy_-s_24 0 GREAT TECHNIQUE STRIKE WITH THE HEEL AND THAT'S THE BACK LEG SIDE KICK
g77gf-Uy_-s_25 0 I'M JOHN GRADEN
HK7a25sxpbw_1 0 OK NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO STEEP TEA USING A DIFFUSING BALL
HK7a25sxpbw_2 0 AND I MEAN THIS ISN'T A BALL BUT TRADITIONALLY THIS TYPE OF APPARATUS WAS IN A ROUND SHAPE
HK7a25sxpbw_3 0 SO BASICALLY THIS IS A GREAT TOOL IF YOU'RE JUST GOING TO MAKE ONE CUP OF TEA FOR YOURSELF
HK7a25sxpbw_4 0 AND IT'S BASICALLY THIS MESH LITTLE HOPPER THAT THE TEA GOES IN AND THEN THE LID SCREWS ON LIKE THAT AND THEN IT'S GOT THIS GREAT LITTLE CHAIN SO YOU CAN HANG IT INTO THE CUP AND WRAP THE CHAIN AROUND THE HANDLE SO YOU'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO PULL IT OUT WITH WHEN YOU'RE DONE
HK7a25sxpbw_5 0 SO FOR THIS I'M JUST GOING TO USE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SOME GREEN TEA AND I'M GOING TO MEASURE OUT MY ONE TEASPOON OF GREEN TEA SINCE WE'RE ONLY MAKING ONE CUP AND I'M GOING TO PUT IT IN THE HOPPER EXCUSE ME
HK7a25sxpbw_6 0 SO THERE'S MY TEA INSIDE AND THEN I'LL SCREW IT ON AND IT MAY LOOK LIKE THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF TEA AND A LOT OF EMPTY SPACE IN HERE AND THAT'S OK BECAUSE WHAT LOOSE TEA NEEDS IS SPACE TO REALLY EXPAND AS THEY TAKE ON WATER
HK7a25sxpbw_7 0 AND SO THAT'S WHAT THAT CREATES THAT TEA IN A BAG DOESN'T REALLY OFFER IS THAT EXTRA SPACE FOR IT TO MOVE AROUND
HK7a25sxpbw_8 0 SO YOU SCREW THE LID ON
HK7a25sxpbw_9 0 SINCE WE'RE DOING GREEN TEA WE'VE GOT WATER THAT'S SUB-BOILING IT'S JUST A LITTLE LESS THAN BOILING
HK7a25sxpbw_10 0 I BROUGHT IT TO A BOIL AND THEN LET IT COOL DOWN A LITTLE BIT
HK7a25sxpbw_11 0 SO I'LL FILL UP ONE CUP WORTH OF WATER IN MY MUG AND THEN SUBMERGE THE DIFFUSING BALL INSIDE THE CUP
HK7a25sxpbw_12 0 AND AGAIN MOST OF THESE HAVE A LITTLE HOOK RIGHT HERE SO THAT YOU CAN WRAP THE CHAIN AROUND THE HANDLE AND THEN HOOK IT ONTO ITSELF SO YOUR CHAIN DOESN'T FALL INTO YOUR CUP
HK7a25sxpbw_13 0 SO SINCE IT'S GREEN TEA WE'RE GOING TO LET IT SIT FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES AND WHEN WE'RE FINISHED PULL OUT THE BALL GIVE IT A FEW SECONDS TO DRAIN
HK7a25sxpbw_14 0 I CAN OPEN IT DISCARD MY USED TEA LEAVES AND THEN RINSE IT OUT AND ENJOY MY CUP OF TEA
_HGmlDEpq_g_1 0 HI MY NAME IS LAUREN WITH MAKEUP BY DODGE AND TODAY WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO MAKE YOUR FACE LOOK THINNER USING MAKEUP
_HGmlDEpq_g_2 0 I AM SURE A LOT OF YOU LADIES WANT TO KNOW HOW TO DO THIS AND IT IS VERY EASY
_HGmlDEpq_g_3 0 SO FIRST YOU NEED TO FIND CONTOURING MAKEUP
_HGmlDEpq_g_4 0 CONTOURING MAKEUP SOME WOULD CALL IT BRONZER
_HGmlDEpq_g_5 0 I PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE BRONZER BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT NO ONE REALLY HAS RED OR ORANGE TONES IN THEIR SKIN UNLESS THEY HAVE A DARKER COMPLEXION BUT A LIGHT LIGHT LIGHT ALMOST PIGMENTLESSLY OF THESE HAVE LITTLE BIT MORE BROWN
_HGmlDEpq_g_6 0 SO I'LL TAKE THIS COLOR WHICH IS A LITTLE BROWN AND I AM GOING TO SWEEP IT UNDERNEATH THE CHEEKBONES AND ON THE RIM OF THE FACE BY THE HAIRLINE AND BRING IT OUT TOWARDS THE CENTER OF THE FACE
_HGmlDEpq_g_7 0 THIS CONTOURING MAKEUP THIS POWDER SHOULD ONLY BE PUT ON WHEN YOU POWDER YOUR FACE ALREADY OR ELSE IT IS GOING TO BE BLOTCHY FROM THE FOUNDATION AND IT IS JUST GOING TO LOOK ALL A MESS
_HGmlDEpq_g_8 0 THE POINT OF THIS IS LIKE I SAID BEFORE IT IS GOING TO MAKE YOUR EYE THINK THAT IT IS RECESSING THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY EXIST AS CLOSE TO THE SURFACE AS IT REALLY DOES AND IF YOU PUT A LITTLE HIGHLIGHT IN THE CENTER OF THE FACE THAT WILL BRING THE CENTER OUT AND THE EDGES BACK SO YOUR FACE WILL THUS LOOK A LITTLE THINNER THAN IT REALLY IS
gcj62_Y5fHA_1 0 OK OUR NEXT SHOT ON OUR THREE MOST BASIC CUE BALL POSITIONS SHOTS IS THE STOP SHOT
gcj62_Y5fHA_2 0 AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF AN ACTION DO WE NEED TO HAVE ON THE CUE BALL ON CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT BALL IN ORDER TO GET IT TO STOP
gcj62_Y5fHA_3 0 AND I'M JUST GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO BE LOOKING FOR ON EVERY STOP SHOT REGARDLESS OF DISTANCE IS YOU WANT TO BE TRYING TO CATCH THE CUE BALL IN IT'S SLIDE
gcj62_Y5fHA_4 0 IN OTHER WORDS THAT'S THE ACTION THAT WE REALLY WANT ON THE CUE BALL IS NO ACTION AT ALL
gcj62_Y5fHA_5 0 WE DON'T WANT IT TO HAVE ANY EXCESS FORWARD ROLL WE DON'T WANT IT TO HAVE ANY EXCESS BACKSPIN OR SIDE SPIN OR ANYTHING ELSE
gcj62_Y5fHA_6 0 WHAT WE WANT IT TO DO IS SLIDE INTO THAT BALL
gcj62_Y5fHA_7 0 BECAUSE IF IT SLIDES STRAIGHT IN TO THE OBJECT BALL WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THE CUE BALL IS GOING TO IMPART ALL OF IT'S ENERGY TO THE OBJECT BALL SENDING THE OBJECT BALL ON ITS WAY AND THE CUE BALL IS GOING TO LOSE EVERYTHING IT'S GOT GOING FOR IT AND IT'S GOING TO STOP DEAD STILL
gcj62_Y5fHA_8 0 SO FROM THIS POSITION RIGHT HERE IN ORDER TO SLIDE THIS BALL FROM THERE TO THERE IT SHOULD BE A SIMPLE MATTER OF HITTING IT RIGHT AT THE CENTER
gcj62_Y5fHA_9 0 BECAUSE WHEN YOU HIT IT AT THE CENTER THAT'S WHEN IT'S GOING TO SLIDE
gcj62_Y5fHA_10 0 AND ON A FAST CLOTH LIKE THIS IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE HIT RIGHT IN THE CENTER AND SLIDE ALL THE WAY OVER TO THAT BALL AND STOP
gcj62_Y5fHA_11 0 THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR
gcj62_Y5fHA_12 0 SLIDING ACTION FOR A STOP SHOT
gpc-T2dm5Tk_1 0 BECAUSE WE HAVE A LAYER OF GLUE AND SOME STICKINESS ON THE BACKSIDE OF THIS BUTTERFLY MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN CONTINUOUSLY PICK IT UP OFF THE SURFACE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT CREATING A BOND WITH YOUR TABLE OR THE TABLE CLOTH
gpc-T2dm5Tk_2 0 SO I KEEP MAKING SURE THAT I CAN PICK IT UP IT'S DRYING AS WE WORK THROUGH THE REST OF THE PROJECT AND WE'RE JUST ABOUT READY TO ATTACH THE PIPE CLEANER BODY
gpc-T2dm5Tk_3 0 THERE ARE SOME OTHER THINGS YOU COULD MAKE THE BODY OUT OF
gpc-T2dm5Tk_4 0 IF YOU HAVE TIN FOIL AND YOU DON'T HAVE A PIPE CLEANER YOU COULD DO THAT AND BASICALLY YOU JUST WANT TO CREATE THE SAME SHAPE
gpc-T2dm5Tk_5 0 WHAT WE'LL DO NOW IS ATTACH IT WITH A STAPLER AND YOU COULD ATTACH THE TIN FOIL WITH A STAPLER AS WELL
gpc-T2dm5Tk_6 0 WHAT WE'LL DO NOW IS BRING IT IN AND WE WANT TO CATCH IT RIGHT HERE BETWEEN THE HEAD AND THE BODY WITH A STAPLE
gpc-T2dm5Tk_7 0 SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO GO IN LIKE THIS AND WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STAPLE IS GOING TO CATCH ON THE CONSTRUCTION PAPER AND NOT THE TISSUE PAPER
gpc-T2dm5Tk_8 0 SO THERE'S THE FIRST PART OF OUR ATTACHMENT
gpc-T2dm5Tk_9 0 AND THEN MAKING SURE THAT THE BUTTERFLY IS FLAT AND THE BODY IS FLAT AND IT HOPEFULLY COMES RIGHT TO THE EDGE OF THE CONSTRUCTION PAPER WE'RE GOING TO BRING THE STAPLER IN AGAIN AND GO IN AT AN ANGLE AND ATTACH IT THERE
gpc-T2dm5Tk_10 0 THIS GIVES US THE ATTACHED BODY ON TO THE WINGS
GMZ10eQZCPA_1 0 STEWART HI WE'RE BACK AND WE ARE GOING TO DO CHRISTOPHER'S ALOHA HONEY HAWAIIAN DELIGHT
GMZ10eQZCPA_2 0 ALRIGHT LET'S DO IT
GMZ10eQZCPA_3 0 WATT OK WHAT IT IS IS YOU WANT TO TAKE A PAPAYA AND YOU WANT TO CUT IT IN HALF AND YOU WANT TO REMOVE THE SEEDS
GMZ10eQZCPA_4 0 WE'VE ALREADY MADE A CONCOCTION OF THAT AND YOU WANT TO BLEND UP THE PAPAYA PART WITHOUT THE SEEDS AND WITHOUT THE PEEL
GMZ10eQZCPA_5 0 SO AFTER YOU REMOVE THE SEEDS YOU'RE GOING TO BLEND THE PAPAYA AND WE'VE ALREADY BLENDED IT UP
GMZ10eQZCPA_6 0 YOU'RE GOING TO ADD HONEY AND A LITTLE BIT OF GREEN TEA TO IT
GMZ10eQZCPA_7 0 WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS MIX THAT ALL UP AND APPLY IT ON TO THE SKIN
GMZ10eQZCPA_8 0 THE PAPAYA HAS LOTS OF ENZYMES IN IT
GMZ10eQZCPA_9 0 STEWART ABOUT HOW MUCH OF THE HONEY
GMZ10eQZCPA_10 0 WATT YOU CAN PUT IN LET'S SAY ABOUT THREE TABLESPOONS OR MORE
GMZ10eQZCPA_13 0 YOU JUST WANT TO BLEND THAT UP OR JUST MIX IT UP
GMZ10eQZCPA_14 0 YOU CAN EVEN ADD A LITTLE BIT OF GREEN TEA IF YOU LIKE
GMZ10eQZCPA_15 0 MAKES IT A REALLY NICE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY BUT ALSO AN EXFOLIATING MASK
GMZ10eQZCPA_16 0 THE PAPAYA HAS NATURAL EXFOLIATING ENZYMES THAT HELP TO REMOVE THE DEAD MATTER FROM THE SKIN AND LEAVES THE SKIN WITH A REALLY NICE GLOW AND IT HELPS OTHER PRODUCTS TO PENETRATE MORE EFFECTIVELY HELPS WITH FINE LINES AND WRINKLES
GMZ10eQZCPA_17 0 THE PAPAYA ENZYMES ARE GREAT
GMZ10eQZCPA_18 0 IT LEAVES THE SKIN RADIANT AND GLOWING AND REALLY MAKES THE SKIN SOFT AND NOTICEABLE
GMZ10eQZCPA_19 0 STEWART OK SO WHEN WE COME BACK WE ARE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO APPLY THIS THE CORRECT WAY
h7NdXDJfE1k_1 0 I'M GOING TO DISCUSS WITH YOU THE PROS AND CONS TO WEARING COLORED CONTACTS
h7NdXDJfE1k_2 0 OBVIOUSLY THE PRO IS I'M CHANGING MY EYE COLOR I'M CHANGING MY APPEARANCE I'M DOING SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT YOU KNOW SOMETHING YOU MAY CONSIDER TO BE FASHIONABLE
h7NdXDJfE1k_3 0 THE OTHER PRO IS SOME PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME SEEING THE CONTACT LENS WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING IT IN OR IF IT DROPS THEY CAN'T SEE IT
h7NdXDJfE1k_4 0 IF YOUR PRESCRIPTION'S BAD ENOUGH MAYBE THE CLEAR CONTACT LENSES DON'T CUT IT SO THE COLOR ACTUALLY HELPS YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE THE CONTACT LENS IS IN RELATION TO YOUR EYE IT MAY BE EASIER TO PUT IN
h7NdXDJfE1k_5 0 THE CONS PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT THIS BUT LIKE I SAID BEFORE THE SIZE CAN BE LIMITING
h7NdXDJfE1k_6 0 THE MAJOR DISTRIBUTOR OF COLORED CONTACT LENSES IN THE WORLD ONLY HAS ONE SIZE OF CONTACT LENS AND IT'S LARGE
h7NdXDJfE1k_7 0 IT'S MEANT TO TAKE YOUR YOU KNOW COVER YOUR WHOLE EYE
h7NdXDJfE1k_8 0 SO THERE COULD BE SOME UNNECESSARY MOVEMENT IT MAY NOT FEEL VERY GOOD AND YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO LIVE WITH THAT SO THEY CAN HAVE COLORED CONTACTS
h7NdXDJfE1k_9 0 THE OTHER THING IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T FEEL RIGHT REALIZE IS IF DOESN'T FIT PROPERLY THE CONTACT LENS MOVES AROUND WHICH HENCE BRINGS THE COLOR INTO YOUR LINE OF SIGHT SO YOU'RE NOT SEEING AS CLEARLY AS YOU WOULD WITH A CLEAR CONTACT LENS
h7NdXDJfE1k_10 0 OR MAYBE IF YOU DIDN'T NEED A PRESCRIPTION WITHOUT ANY CONTACT LENS AT ALL
h7NdXDJfE1k_11 0 IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT PURCHASING COLORED CONTACT LENSES
G7NXP_mBptg_1 0 WELCOME TO MY STUDIO
G7NXP_mBptg_2 0 I'M LARS ROBINSON
G7NXP_mBptg_3 0 I'M AN ILLUSTRATOR
G7NXP_mBptg_4 0 TODAY WE ARE GOING TO DEMONSTRATE HOW TO DRAW A TREE AND ACTUALLY PEOPLE MIGHT THINK OH THAT MIGHT BE VERY EASY BUT THERE IS DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN YOU DRAW A TREE
G7NXP_mBptg_5 0 IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO OVERDO DRAWING A TREE WITH ALL THE LITTLE LEAVES ON IT BUT THAT'S WHERE IT COMES IN HANDY HAVING CHARCOAL AND A PIECE OF PENCIL LED AND BLOCKING THOSE SHAPES
G7NXP_mBptg_6 0 THINK OF WHERE THE LIGHT IS HITTING IT AND BLOCK IN THE SHAPES
G7NXP_mBptg_7 0 HOW TO DRAW A TREE O'KAY YOU THINK THEN YOU COME DOWN FROM THERE AND YOU HAVE THE TREE PART OF IT COMING DOWN HERE ON ONE SIDE AND THE LIGHT IS COMING FROM THIS SIDE
G7NXP_mBptg_8 0 ALWAYS THINK ABOUT LIGHTING THINK ABOUT WHERE THE LIGHT IS HITTING IT
G7NXP_mBptg_9 0 SO ON THIS ONE IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE COMING FROM THIS SIDE AND WE CAN CREATE THAT AND YOU THINK OH THE TREE TRUNK IS ALWAYS DARK BUT THAT IS NOT ALWAYS TRUE THERE IS HIGHLIGHTS TO THAT TOO
G7NXP_mBptg_10 0 THEN WHEN IT COMES UP TO THE MAIN PART HERE YOU KNOW THAT IT STARTS BREAKING APART FROM THE TOP OF IT AND THERE IS ARMS COMING OUT OF IT
G7NXP_mBptg_11 0 I DID THIS WIZARD OF OZ THEME PARK AND THEY WERE COMING UP WITH DIFFERENT IDEAS FOR WIZARD OF OZ AND I DID THE TWO DOORS OPENING UP AND I HAD THESE REALLY WILD TREES WITH IT A LOT OF MOVEMENT IN IT AND THAT IS REALLY FUN BECAUSE YOU CAN FIND A LOT OF MOVEMENT IN TREES
G7NXP_mBptg_12 0 YOU CAN HAVE FUN WITH IT
G7NXP_mBptg_13 0 YOU CAN DO ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES BUT THEN AT THE END OF IT YOU GET JUST A FEW OF THE LEAVES COMING IN HERE
G7NXP_mBptg_14 0 YOU CAN OVERDO IT
G7NXP_mBptg_15 0 WE CAN UNDERDO IT
G7NXP_mBptg_16 0 AT THE END OF IT THERE IS ROOTS SOMETIMES COMING OUT HERE AND THERE IS ROOTS BEHIND IT WHICH SHOWS PERSPECTIVE TOO BECAUSE IT GOES BEHIND IT AND THEN IT GOES IN FRONT OF IT
G7NXP_mBptg_17 0 BUT THERE YOU GO THERE IS ANOTHER TREE IN THE BACK SIMPLIFIED AND ANOTHER ONE AND BUSHES
G7NXP_mBptg_18 0 SEE HOW TO DRAW A TREE
G7NXP_mBptg_19 0 THANK YOU GUYS
G7NXP_mBptg_20 0 HOPE THAT HELPS YOU GUYS UNDERSTAND HOW TO DRAW A TREE AND THE BASIC PRINCIPLES BEHIND THAT
G7NXP_mBptg_21 0 HAVE A GREAT DAY
G-ZJkhmmGWE_1 0 SO WE DON'T WANT TO GET WAX ON LOTS OF THE PARTS ON THIS GUITAR
G-ZJkhmmGWE_2 0 THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE REALLY CAN'T MAKE EXCEPTIONS FOR LIKE THE ELECTRONICS
G-ZJkhmmGWE_3 0 WE HAVE TO BE ESPECIALLY CAREFUL ABOUT THEM WHEN WE GO ABOUT THE PROCESS
G-ZJkhmmGWE_4 0 HOWEVER THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE CAN TAKE OFF AND PUT BACK ON RELATIVELY EASY THAT WE WOULDN'T MIND DOING AT OUR HOME AND IT'S WELL WORTH PROTECTING THE WOOD OF THE GUITAR TO PUT IN THE TIME TO TAKE THESE PARTS OFF
G-ZJkhmmGWE_5 0 AND IT'S WELL WORTH IT FOR THE PARTS TO KEEP THEM WORKING PROPERLY TO TAKE THEM OFF AND NOT TO GET THEM INVOLVED IN THE WAXING AND POLISHING PROCESS
G-ZJkhmmGWE_6 0 SO THE PARTS ON THIS GUITAR THAT WE CAN TAKE OFF ARE THE BRIDGE THE STRINGS THE STRING HOLDER WHICH ALL FULL BODY ACOUSTIC GUITARS THAT ARE ELECTRIC HAVE A STRING HOLDER ON THEM
G-ZJkhmmGWE_7 0 WE CAN TAKE OFF OUR STRAP HOLDERS AND ALSO WE CAN TAKE OFF OUR TUNERS AFTER WE TAKE OFF OUR STRINGS
G-ZJkhmmGWE_8 0 AND WE CAN DO THIS JUST WITH A SCREWDRIVER
G-ZJkhmmGWE_9 0 ALL THIS CAN BE DONE WITH A SCREWDRIVER AND WITH A PAIR OF NEEDLE NOSE PLIERS
GS9T1hVI0co_1 0 ANOTHER GAME INCREASING IN POPULARITY TODAY IS CALLED SEVEN CARD STUD
GS9T1hVI0co_2 0 SEVEN-CARD STUD IS EACH PLAYER IS DEALT SEVEN CARDS
GS9T1hVI0co_3 0 THREE OF THE CARDS WILL BE FACE DOWN CALLED THEIR HOLE CARDS
GS9T1hVI0co_4 0 AND FOUR CARDS WILL BE DEALT FACE UP FOR ALL THE PLAYERS AT THE TABLE TO SEE
GS9T1hVI0co_5 0 LET'S SEE HOW THIS GAME IS DEALT OUT
GS9T1hVI0co_6 0 FIRST THE DEALER DEALS TWO DOWN CARDS TO EACH PLAYER
GS9T1hVI0co_7 0 ONCE THE DEALER HAS DEALT TWO DOWN CARDS TO EACH PLAYER HE WILL THEN DEAL ONE CARD FACE UP IN FRONT OF EACH PLAYER AND THE FIRST BETTING ROUND FOLLOWS THIS
GS9T1hVI0co_8 0 ON THE FIRST BETTING ROUND THE LOW CARD THAT IS SHOWING WILL ACTUALLY START THE BETTING
GS9T1hVI0co_9 0 SO IN THIS CASE THE SEVEN OF SPADES THEY WILL START THE BETTING
GS9T1hVI0co_10 0 ONCE THE BETTING IS OVER THE DEALER WILL THEN GIVE EACH PLAYER ANOTHER CARD FACE UP CALLED FOURTH STREET
GS9T1hVI0co_11 0 AFTER THIS DEAL NOW THE BETTING STARTS WITH THE PLAYER WITH THE HIGHEST CARD SHOWING
GS9T1hVI0co_12 0 IN THIS BETTING ROUND THE PLAYER WITH THE KING WOULD START THE BETTING ROUND
GS9T1hVI0co_13 0 THE NEXT CARD TO COME TO EACH PLAYER IS CALLED FIFTH STREET
GS9T1hVI0co_14 0 AGAIN THE PLAYER STARTS THE BETTING WITH THE HIGHEST CARD SHOWING THIS BEING THE KING
GS9T1hVI0co_15 0 THE NEXT CARD TO EACH PLAYER IS CALLED SIXTH STREET AND THIS WILL ALSO BE THE LAST CARD FACE UP TO EACH PLAYER
GS9T1hVI0co_16 0 IN THIS INSTANCE THE PAIR OF TENS WOULD START THE BETTING
GS9T1hVI0co_17 0 AT THE END OF THIS BETTING ROUND THE PLAYER WILL DEAL THE LAST CARD TO EACH PLAYER THIS CARD BEING DEALT FACE DOWN OFTEN REFERRED TO AS DOWN AND DIRTY
GS9T1hVI0co_18 0 AFTER THE CARDS HAVE BEEN DEALT OUT THERE'LL BE ONE FINAL BETTING ROUND AND EACH PLAYER WILL LOOK AT THEIR HAND AND USE THEIR BEST FIVE CARDS OF SEVEN TO MAKE THEIR BEST FIVE CARD HAND
GS9T1hVI0co_19 0 AND THIS IS HOW SEVEN STUDS ARE PLAYED OUT
GBMkrBfzPko_1 0 I'M GUESSING IT'S GOING TO BE A WOOL BLEND BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T SEE
GBMkrBfzPko_2 0 THERE'S NOTHING THERE
GBMkrBfzPko_3 0 YEAH THERE'S NOTHING THERE SO WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH WOOL BLEND
GBMkrBfzPko_4 0 ON MY MAN'S SUIT WE'RE GOING TO SET OUR IRON TO STEAM AND WE ARE NOT NOT NOT NOT GOING TO USE ANY STARCH OR SIZING OR ANY OF THAT KIND OF STUFF BECAUSE THAT WOULD RUIN THE SUIT
GBMkrBfzPko_5 0 SO IT'S JUST GOING TO BE STEAM APPLIED TO THE SUIT
GBMkrBfzPko_6 0 A LOT OF PEOPLE TRY TO MAKE IT CRISP BY USING STARCH AND SIZING AND WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT
GBMkrBfzPko_7 0 NORMALLY SUITS ARE SENT TO THE DRY CLEANERS AND THEY HAVE BIG PRESSES THAT THEY PUT THE SUITS IN TO PRESS THEM
GBMkrBfzPko_8 0 YOU CAN DO TOUCH-UPS AT HOME JUST TO MAKE IT LOOK BETTER
GBMkrBfzPko_9 0 IF YOUR FOR INSTANCE IF YOUR RIDING IN A CAR FOR A LONG TIME YOU MIGHT HAVE WRINKLES IN THE BACK OF THE SUIT
GBMkrBfzPko_10 0 THE CROTCH AREA OF COURSE IS GOING TO GET WRINKLED FROM SITTING BUT NORMALLY YOU DON'T PRESS SUITS AT HOME BUT YOU CAN DO TOUCH-UPS
GBMkrBfzPko_11 0 THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO ATTEMPT TO DO TODAY
hH-bIIEYcsE_1 0 HI I'M REBECCA GUENTHER AT WWW.M5A1PHOTOGRAPHY.COM AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOME PORTRAIT STUDIO LIGHTING TECHNIQUES
hH-bIIEYcsE_2 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IN PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHY WHEN YOU'RE IN THE STUDIO IS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF LIGHTS REALLY IF YOU WANT TO DO IT RIGHT
hH-bIIEYcsE_3 0 YOU WANT TO HAVE A MAIN LIGHT JUST TO ONE SIDE OF THE MODELS FACE THEN YOU WANT TO EITHER HAVE A SECOND LIGHT OR A BIG WHITE BOUNCE CARD TO BOUNCE THE LIGHT BACK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MODELS FACE
hH-bIIEYcsE_4 0 THEN YOU WANT TO HAVE WHATS CALLED A HAIR LIGHT THAT WILL BE AIMED AT THE BACK OF THE MODELS HEAD SO THAT THEIR HAIR STANDS OUT FROM THE BACKGROUND AND SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THE DEPTH OF THEIR HEAD ACTUALLY
hH-bIIEYcsE_5 0 AND OF COURSE YOU WANT TO HAVE ONE OR TWO LIGHTS ON THE BACKGROUND SO THAT THE MODEL STANDS OUT FROM THE BACKGROUND AND IS DEFINED AGAINST THE BACKGROUND AND YOU CAN DO SOMETHING INTERESTING AS WELL YOU CAN PUT A GEL ON THAT TO MAKE IT A DIFFERENT COLOR OR YOU CAN PUT A TEXTURED FABRIC UP ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING AND GIVE THE EFFECT THAT YOU WANT TO GIVE
hH-bIIEYcsE_6 0 AND THOSE ARE SOME PORTRAIT STUDIO LIGHTING TECHNIQUES
gDJZQybnkmg_1 0 HI THIS IS BRUCE LESSELS FROM ZOAR OUTDOOR ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM TALKING ABOUT LOW IMPACT CAMPING METHODS
gDJZQybnkmg_2 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE CAMPING IN AN AREA THAT GETS USED A LOT YOU WANT TO TRY TO RESTRICT YOUR CAMPING ACTIVITY TO THE AREAS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DESIGNATED AS CAMPSITES
gDJZQybnkmg_3 0 IN THIS CASE YOU HAVE THE CAMPSITE THAT'S DESIGNATED AS SITE FIVE YOU HAVE KIND OF NICE CLEARLY LAID OUT AREA THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR CAMPING AND YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR CAMPING ACTIVITIES RIGHT WITHIN THIS AREA AND NOT GO OUTSIDE THEM
gDJZQybnkmg_4 0 THE IDEA IS TO LIMIT THE IMPACT TO CERTAIN AREAS AND NOT ALLOW THE IMPACTS TO GET TOO FAR OUT BEYOND THOSE AND THEREFORE START TO REALLY RUIN THE AREA AROUND IT
gDJZQybnkmg_5 0 AGAIN OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO USE THIS SITE OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO ENJOY THE SAME EXPERIENCE YOU GOT TO ENJOY AND SO IN MORE HEAVILY USED AREAS TRY TO FIND AREAS THAT ARE ALREADY IMPACTED AND THAT ARE ALREADY USED FOR CAMPING AND TRY TO CAMP IN THOSE AREAS RESPECTFULLY AND USE THEM IN A GOOD WAY AND HOPEFULLY WHEN YOU COME BACK THEY'LL BE AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO USE THE NEXT TIME
gNpN9jn6lAA_1 0 HI I'M KERRI AT ZEBRA IN BERKELEY AND I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT NOSE PIERCING AND THE HEALING PROCESS
gNpN9jn6lAA_2 0 WHEN YOU GET YOUR NOSE PIERCED INITIALLY THE PAIN IS PRETTY MINIMAL IT KIND OF ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE POPPING A ZIT
gNpN9jn6lAA_3 0 THAT FIRST DAY YOU CAN NOTICE A TINY BIT OF BLEEDING AND A LITTLE BIT OF INFLAMMATION
gNpN9jn6lAA_4 0 THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED
gNpN9jn6lAA_5 0 DURING THE FIRST TWO WEEKS YOUR NOSE IS GOING TO SWELL UP SLIGHTLY ON THE INSIDE NO ONE'S GOING TO NOTICE
gNpN9jn6lAA_6 0 ONCE THAT SWELLING GOES DOWN YOUR JEWELRY MIGHT MOVE AROUND A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE IT'S NOW LOOSER DUE TO MORE SPACE
gNpN9jn6lAA_7 0 AT THAT POINT YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO WANT TO GO SEE YOUR PIERCER AND HAVE IT ADJUSTED SO IT FITS A LOT MORE TIGHTLY
gNpN9jn6lAA_8 0 IF YOUR JEWELRY MOVES AROUND TOO MUCH FOR THE REST OF THE HEALING PROCESS IT COULD CAUSE IRRITATION AND THAT COULD RESULT IN AN INFECTION
gNpN9jn6lAA_9 0 SO IF YOU GO IN AND HAVE IT ADJUSTED YOU CAN AVOID ALL OF THAT
gNpN9jn6lAA_10 0 FOR THE NEXT FOUR TO SIX WEEKS YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO CONTINUE WITH A REGULAR AFTERCARE PROCESS WHICH CONSISTS OF CLEANING BOTH WITH AN ANTIBACTERIAL SOLUTION
gNpN9jn6lAA_12 0 AND ALSO SOAKING WITH SALT WATER
gNpN9jn6lAA_13 0 I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT SOAKING WITH SALT WATER IS TO THE HEALING PROCESS AND KEEPING YOUR NOSE NICE AND HEALTHY
gNpN9jn6lAA_14 0 NOSE PIERCINGS HAVE A VERY HARD TIME HEALING BECAUSE OF THEIR CARTILAGE AND SO IF YOU'RE NOTICING A LITTLE BIT OF REDNESS OR TENDERNESS OR TENDERNESS OR UNCOMFORTABLENESS IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY NORMAL
gNpN9jn6lAA_15 0 ALL IN ALL IT'S AN EASY PROCESS AND COMPARED TO OTHER THINGS IN LIFE BUT WITH A NOSE PIERCING YOU SHOULD EXPECT THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO LOOK PERFECT UNTIL IT'S DONE HEALING
g4TswJ84cyE_1 0 ALRIGHT FOLKS IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO WRITE A DOCUMENTARY
g4TswJ84cyE_2 0 WRITING A SCRIPT FOR A DOCUMENTARY IS NOT LIKE WRITING A SCRIPT FOR A FEATURE FILM OBVIOUSLY
g4TswJ84cyE_3 0 THERE ISN'T THE SAME SORT OF NARRATIVE THREAD THE STORY LINE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
g4TswJ84cyE_4 0 INSTEAD WHAT YOU HAVE IS THE IDEA AND THE WAY THAT YOU WANT TO PRESENT WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU ARE DOCUMENTING WHETHER IT BE AN INDIVIDUAL OR AN EVENT THAT HAPPENED AT ONE PARTICULAR POINT OR ANOTHER OR AN ISSUE
g4TswJ84cyE_5 0 SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO IS FIRST OF ALL OUTLINE HOW YOU WANT TO DO THIS SO SIT DOWN IN FRONT OF YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN BLANK PAGE AND HAMMER OUT EXACTLY WHERE YOU WANT THAT YOU'RE PRESENTATION TO GO WHAT YOU WANT TO COVER HOW YOU WANT TO COVER IT AND ULTIMATELY WHAT MESSAGE YOU WANT TO LEAVE WITH THE AUDIENCE SO DO THIS FIRST
g4TswJ84cyE_6 0 SECOND OF ALL MOST DOCUMENTARIES TODAY HAVE SOME DEGREE OF NARRATION OR SOMEONE THAT BASICALLY GUIDES AN AUDIENCE THROUGH THE PRESENTATION OR A HOST WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE SOMEONE WHO'S ACTUALLY ON CAMERA GUIDING PEOPLE THROUGH AND A LOT OF TIMES IT'LL BE BOTH
g4TswJ84cyE_7 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO OBVIOUSLY HAVE CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SCRIPTED WORK FOR THIS PERSON SO THE NEXT STEP WOULD THEN BE TO WRITE THIS PORTION OF THE DOCUMENTARY AND YOU WRITE THAT THE SAME WAY YOU WOULD A SCRIPT
g4TswJ84cyE_8 0 YOU HAVE- BASICALLY YOU WRITE OUT EACH AND EVERY BIT OF NARRATION AND THE CHUNK OF THE MOVIE THAT THAT PART APPLIES TO YOU JUST DESCRIBING DURING THIS SCENE WHAT WOULD BE HAPPENING OR DURING THAT CHUNK- WHAT CHUNK OF THE MOVIE WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHAT IT IS YOU'RE PRESENTING WHETHER IT BE GRAPHICS OLD ARCHIVE FOOTAGE FOOTAGE THAT YOU SHOT YOURSELF
g4TswJ84cyE_9 0 BASICALLY GET IT ALL WRITTEN DOWN AND THEN WRITE THE NARRATION AS YOU SEE FIT
g4TswJ84cyE_10 0 A LOT OF TIMES THIS PART OF THE PRODUCTION WOULD BE DONE ACTUALLY YOU'VE COLLECTED ALL OF YOUR FOOTAGE
g4TswJ84cyE_11 0 MOST OF THE TIME WHEN YOU'RE PRODUCING A DOCUMENTARY YOU'VE ALREADY GOTTEN A BUNCH OF FOOTAGE SHOT SO AS YOU'RE WRITING THE NARRATION YOU SORT OF HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF THE STORY THAT YOU'RE ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE PRESENTING TO YOUR AUDIENCE
g4TswJ84cyE_12 0 SO AFTER YOU'VE COMPILED THE FOOTAGE AND YOU'VE STARTED TO MAKE A ROUGH CUT OF THE DOCUMENTARY THIS CAN BE WHEN YOU GO AND WRITE THIS PORTION THE NARRATION THE STUFF THAT'S SUPPOSED TO ACCOMPANY THE FOOTAGE THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE
g4TswJ84cyE_13 0 SO SORT OF KNOWING THE CUT THAT YOU HAVE DOWN ALREADY WRITE OUT BASICALLY WHAT WE WILL BE SEEING IN THAT SECTION OF THE MOVIE AND THEN WRITE OUT THE CORRESPONDING NARRATION
g4TswJ84cyE_14 0 THIS IS REALLY THE BEST WAY TO WRITE A DOCUMENTARY
h29nl1fI4qw_1 0 IN THIS CLIP THE STAIRS ARE PROBABLY THE HARDEST THING WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT ALL DAY AND IT IS A PRETTY BIG DROP
h29nl1fI4qw_2 0 SO YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION HOW FAST YOU ARE GOING YOUR TIMING WHEN YOU POP THE TRICK TIME YOU ARE IN THE AIR AND THEN YOUR CATCH AND THEN HOW YOU LAND
h29nl1fI4qw_3 0 SO THERE IS A LOT MORE VARIABLES IN THE STAIRS ALONE THAN PROBABLY THE HIP OR THE JUMP OVER THERE AND THIS IS WHERE IT STARTS TO GET DIFFICULT RIGHT HERE I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY
h29nl1fI4qw_4 0 CAUSE I MEAN THE HIP AND YOU HAVE GOT STAIRS AT ALL THE SKATE PARKS TOO BUT JUST REAL LIFE THINGS LIKE IF YOU SKATE THE STAIRS ON THE STREETS THERE IS MORE CONCRETE BUT IT IS KIND OF A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT SO THERE IS NOTHING TOO MUCH TO WORRY ABOUT
GoZxF1Soz3o_1 0 HI MY NAME IS CHRIS LATHAM AND WE'RE HERE TODAY AT EMI MUSIC PUBLISHING'S NASHVILLE RECORDING STUDIO ON MUSIC ROW WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
GoZxF1Soz3o_2 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BUDGET PLANNING JUST A LITTLE BIT
GoZxF1Soz3o_3 0 THE MUSICIANS THAT WORK HERE ARE ALL PART OF THE MUSICIANS UNION AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT SCALES OF PAY THAT THE MUSICIANS WORK UNDER
GoZxF1Soz3o_4 0 THERE'S THE DEMO SCALE WHICH IS ROUGHLY $190 PER MUSICIAN FOR A THREE HOUR SESSION
GoZxF1Soz3o_5 0 BUT WITH A DEMO SCALE THAT DOESN'T PERMIT YOU TO GO OUT AND SELL YOUR FINISHED PROJECT
GoZxF1Soz3o_6 0 SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE SELLING THIS IN YOUR COMMUNITY YOU'RE GOING TO BE SELLING IT FROM STAGE WHEN YOU PLAY PLACES YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT THE LIMITED PRESSING SCALE WHICH IS JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN SCALE PER PERSON
GoZxF1Soz3o_7 0 THE LIMITED PRESSING SCALE ALLOWS YOU TO SELL UP TO TEN THOUSAND COPIES BEFORE YOU HAVE TO UPGRADE TO MASTER SCALE
GoZxF1Soz3o_8 0 TEN THOUSAND IS QUITE A FEW COPIES TO SELL FROM STAGE OR OUT OF THE TRUNK OF YOUR CAR
GoZxF1Soz3o_9 0 ONE OTHER SCALE THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER IS THE LOW BUDGET SCALE WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO SELL UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF COPIES BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE LOW BUDGET APPROVAL BEFORE YOUR SESSION SO YOU HAVE TO SUBMIT A BUDGET TO THE MUSICIANS UNION FORTY-EIGHT HOURS BEFORE YOUR SCHEDULED SESSION IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THIS
GoZxF1Soz3o_10 0 IT'S NOT MUCH MORE THAN LIMITED PRESSING OR DEMO SCALE BUT THAT WAY YOU CAN GO OUT AND SELL AS MANY COPIES AS YOU WANT OF YOUR PROJECT
GoZxF1Soz3o_11 0 IF YOU'D LIKE TO FIND OUT MORE INFORMATION OR THE EXACT NUMBERS OF PAY SCALE CHECK MY WEBSITE STUDIOGORILLA.COM AND I'LL HAVE LINKS TO THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF MUSICIANS WEBSITE SO THAT YOU CAN GET A LITTLE FURTHER RESEARCH ON YOUR OWN
GqpLExoQ8iU_1 0 HI THE DRINK WE ARE ABOUT TO MAKE IS CALLED CAPTAIN PEPPER
GqpLExoQ8iU_2 0 PRETTY SIMPLE DRINK HERE WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO OUR ICE IN A GLASS AND MEASURE OUT ONE SHOT OF CAPTAIN MORGAN HENCE THE CAPTAIN IN CAPTAIN PEPPER
GqpLExoQ8iU_3 0 THERE WE GO
GqpLExoQ8iU_4 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO FILL IT THE REST OF THE WAY WITH GOOD OLD DOCTOR PEPPER
GqpLExoQ8iU_5 0 SO WE'VE GOT OUR CAPTAIN AND WE'VE GOT OUR PEPPER
GqpLExoQ8iU_6 0 WE'RE NOT GOING TO USE ACTUAL PEPPER FOR THIS IT'S DOCTOR PEPPER
GqpLExoQ8iU_7 0 AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE MIX IT UP REAL WELL
GqpLExoQ8iU_8 0 SO IF YOU'RE A BIG CAPTAIN AND COKE FAN IT'S USUALLY WHAT YOU ORDER AT THE BAR OR WHAT YOU SIP AT HOME YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY OUT THE CAPTAIN PEPPERS FOR A LITTLE BIT OF SOMETHING DIFFERENT
GqpLExoQ8iU_9 0 YOU STILL GOT YOUR COLA IT'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO HAVE A DIFFERENT FLAVOR BUT IT DEFINITELY WILL SPICE IT UP A LITTLE BIT AND BREAK UP THE MONOTONY OF YOUR CAPTAIN AND COKES ALL THE TIME
GqpLExoQ8iU_10 0 LET'S GET OUR GLASS AND GIVE IT A POUR AND THERE WE GO
GqpLExoQ8iU_11 0 STRAW AND BOTTOMS UP
HbkUVUcdzeg_1 0 THE NITROUS MACHINE IS BASICALLY ALMOST A CANNISTER DEVICE THAT HOLDS OXYGEN AND THE GAS OF WHAT WE KNOW AS NITROUS OXIDE
HbkUVUcdzeg_2 0 AGAIN NITROUS OXIDE IS A GAS THAT WE KNOW THAT WHEN BREATHED IN THROUGH YOUR NOSE THAT OVER A COUPLE MINUTES OF EXPOSURE TIME IT WILL ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A FEELING OF WELLNESS AND EUPHORIA
HbkUVUcdzeg_3 0 CERTAINLY THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUMENTS THAT WE USE ARE WHAT WE CALL HAND INSTRUMENTS
HbkUVUcdzeg_4 0 HAND INSTRUMENTS ARE BASICALLY DIFFERENT METAL INSTRUMENTS OF DIFFERENT SHAPES AND DIFFERENT POINTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT THAT WE USE FOR A BROAD AMOUNT OF PROCEDURES
HbkUVUcdzeg_5 0 IT CAN BE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS DOING AN EXAM OR FIXING A FILLING OR MAYBE DOING A CLEANING AND IT CAN BE AS BROAD AS DOING AN EXTRACTION OR DOING A ROOT CANAL
HbkUVUcdzeg_6 0 THOSE THINGS WE BASICALLY USE ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF HAND INSTRUMENTS SO THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT HAND INSTRUMENTS THAT WE UTILIZE
HbkUVUcdzeg_7 0 CERTAINLY WHAT THE DENTIST IS MOST NOTORIOUS FOR IS THE HAND DRILL WHICH IS AN OBJECT THAT WE USE TYPICALLY TO REMOVE CAVITIES SOMETIMES REMOVAL OF FILLINGS OR TO DO COSMETIC PREPARATIONS ON TEETH OR EVEN THINGS LIKE REMOVING BONE AROUND TEETH
HbkUVUcdzeg_8 0 SOME OF THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS THAT WE USE ARE WE USE A LOT OF X-RAY DEVICES TO CAPTURE DIFFERENT IMAGES OF THE GUM AND THE BONE AND THE SUPPORTING TEETH
HbkUVUcdzeg_9 0 WE CAN USE OUR X-RAYS TO LOOK AT THE SINUSES AND ALL KINDS OF ABNORMALITIES IN THE GUMS AND THE BONE
HbkUVUcdzeg_10 0 OTHER THINGS THAT WE CAN OFTEN USE ARE WE USE LOTS OF DIFFERENT IMPRESSION MATERIALS AND A LOT OF THE THINGS IN DENTISTRY WE DO WE REQUIRE SOME SORT OF MOLD OF THE PATIENT'S MOUTH SO THERE ARE VARIOUS MATERIALS DEPENDING ON WHAT SORT OF PROCESSES YOU ARE MAKING OF THE PATIENT
HbkUVUcdzeg_11 0 WE USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT IMPRESSION MATERIALS
HbkUVUcdzeg_12 0 AS FAR AS THE PAIN RELIEVERS GO THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT WE CAN PRESENT TO A PATIENT WHO AGAIN HAS PROBLEMS DEALING WITH THE ANXIETY OR MORE OR LESS THE PAIN
HbkUVUcdzeg_13 0 ONE VERSION IS WHAT WE CALL SEDATION AND SEDATION IS KIND OF A GENERIC TERM FOR DESCRIBING A WAY TO BASICALLY CALM THE PATIENT DOWN AND IT CAN BE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS GIVING THEM SOME LAUGHING GAS ALSO KNOWN AS NITROUS OXIDE WHICH CAN KIND OF HELP RELIEVE THE NERVES OF THE PATIENT
HbkUVUcdzeg_14 0 IT ALSO HELPS WITH PAIN CONTROL AS WELL
HbkUVUcdzeg_15 0 THAT IS KIND OF THE SIMPLEST FORM
HbkUVUcdzeg_16 0 THERE IS OTHER FORMS SUCH AS ORAL SEDATION WHICH WOULD INVOLVE TAKING A PILL BEFORE THE APPOINTMENT AND THAT KIND OF HELPS CREATE KIND OF HELPS RELIEVE SOME OF THAT ANXIETY AND CAN CERTAINLY HELP WITH PAIN AS WELL
HbkUVUcdzeg_17 0 THE OTHER FORMS OF SEDATION THAT WE COULD OFFER TO A PATIENT WOULD BE IV SEDATION WHERE AN IV IS ACTUALLY STARTED IN YOUR ARM AND MEDICATIONS ARE ACTUALLY PUSHED THROUGH YOUR IV AND THAT ACTUALLY HELPS PUT YOU TO SLEEP
HbkUVUcdzeg_18 0 IT KIND OF HELPS CREATE AMNESIA HELPS WITH PAIN CONTROL AND MAKES IT A VERY COMFORTABLE EXPERIENCE FOR THE PATIENT
HbkUVUcdzeg_19 0 THEN THERE IS ALSO WHICH IS THE BROADEST ONE WHICH IS CALLED GENERAL ANESTHESIA WHICH TYPICALLY ISN'T SEEN IN THE DENTAL ENVIRONMENT UNLESS IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN ORAL SURGEON
HbkUVUcdzeg_20 0 THAT IS WHERE ANOTHER TYPE OF MASK KIND OF LIKE THE LAUGHING GAS IS PUT ON THE PATIENT AND THEY ARE BASICALLY PUT COMPLETELY UNDER TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WILL NOT HEAR ANYTHING AND THEY CANNOT HEAR ANYTHING
HbkUVUcdzeg_21 0 IT IS A LITTLE MORE EXTREME AND NOT VERY COMMON IN THE DENTAL SCENARIO BUT IT IS AVAILABLE
gqcqN86jHhQ_1 0 THE SERVER STARTS THE POINT AND YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TWO CHANCES TO PUT THE BALL INSIDE THE SMALL SQUARE ACROSS YOU INSIDE THE SERVICE LINE
gqcqN86jHhQ_2 0 YOU HAVE TWO SERVES
gqcqN86jHhQ_3 0 SO YOU WANT TO HAVE TWO BALLS IN YOUR HAND
gqcqN86jHhQ_4 0 TRY NOT TO HAVE THEM ON THE FLOOR BECAUSE IF THEY'RE ON THE FLOOR AND YOU START YOUR POINT AND THEN ON YOUR WAY YOU MIGHT STEP ON THEM AND HURT YOURSELF
gqcqN86jHhQ_5 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE THEM ON THE BACK BECAUSE THE SERVE IS SOMETHING WITH A LOT OF RHYTHM
gqcqN86jHhQ_6 0 SO YOU WANT TO HAVE IF YOU MISS THE FIRST ONE THE FIRST ONE IS GOING TO GIVE YOU LOTS OF CLUES OF WHAT YOU'VE MISSED
gqcqN86jHhQ_7 0 SO YOU WANT TO DO THE SECOND RIGHT AWAY

gqcqN86jHhQ_11 0 LOOK AT MY WRIST
gqcqN86jHhQ_12 0 MY WRIST IS LOOKING UP AND THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR MY TOSS
gqcqN86jHhQ_13 0 THE TOSS IS THE HARDEST AND THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE SERVE AND BASICALLY WHAT YOU DO ON THE TOSS YOU ARE THROWING THE BALL RIGHT WHERE YOU NEED IT TO BE IN ORDER TO HIT THE SHOT
gqcqN86jHhQ_14 0 WHEN YOU DO THE TOSS YOU SHIFT THE WEIGHT FROM YOUR RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR BODY TO YOUR LEFT SIDE OF YOUR BODY AND YOU JUST BRING YOUR ARM UP
gqcqN86jHhQ_15 0 RIGHT ABOUT WHEN YOU ARE ABOUT THIS DISTANCE YOU RELEASE THE BALL SO THE BALL GOES
gqcqN86jHhQ_16 0 LET'S DO ONE EXAMPLE
gqcqN86jHhQ_17 0 WRIST UP BRING THE BALL UP AND ABOUT HERE I WILL RELEASE THE BALL
gqcqN86jHhQ_18 0 LET'S DO THE WHOLE THING AS WE WOULD NORMALLY DO IT
gqcqN86jHhQ_19 0 WRIST UP TOSS IT AND I KNOW I DID IT GOOD
gqcqN86jHhQ_20 0 IF I'M MORE OR LESS ABLE TO GET IT ON MY HAND
gqcqN86jHhQ_21 0 LET'S DO IT AGAIN
gqcqN86jHhQ_23 0 ACTUALLY YOU WANT TO START HERE AND GET THE BALL UP AND THAT'S HOW THE TOSS IS DONE

GUfZ2KzUmBQ_26 0 WHEN A DOG LIKE YOU HAVE THEIR BEST INTEREST IN MIND THEY TEND TO WORK WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT BETTER
GUfZ2KzUmBQ_27 0 TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TO ALWAYS REMAIN THE DOMINANT ALFA DOG
GUfZ2KzUmBQ_28 0 WHETHER YOU'RE A MALE OR A FEMALE WHETHER THE DOG IS MALE OR FEMALE

gQd3MWSR9Bk_2 0 AGAIN WHEN I FIRST STARTED TALKING ABOUT BECOMING A REALTOR WE'RE ALL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AS PEOPLE
gQd3MWSR9Bk_3 0 WHEN I FIRST STARTED SEEING ALL THOSE SIGNS OUT THERE WITH MY BROKER I THOUGHT UH THEY'VE GOT TOO MANY AGENTS
gQd3MWSR9Bk_4 0 AND THAT WILL BE THE MIND SET THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL HAVE WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT BECOMING REALTORS
gQd3MWSR9Bk_5 0 GOSH EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND A CORNER THERE'S ANOTHER SIGN

gQd3MWSR9Bk_9 0 THERE'S A REASON FOR THE SEASON
gQd3MWSR9Bk_10 0 MAYBE THERE'S A REASON THIS BROKER HAS SO MANY AGENTS
gQd3MWSR9Bk_11 0 LET ME TELL YOU WHY I CHOSE THE BROKER THAT I DID I LOVE THE EDUCATION
gQd3MWSR9Bk_12 0 THAT'S WHAT WORKS FOR ME I'M A GIRL ABOUT EDUCATING LIKE I SAID I'M A RESEARCHER GIVE ME MORE FEED MY BRAIN CAN I PICK YOUR BRAIN

ga1ENQpm660_2 0 SORRY IT DIDN'T COME OUT TOO PERFECTLY
ga1ENQpm660_3 0 HERE'S OUR C LET'S LOOK UP HERE
ga1ENQpm660_4 0 A SLIGHTLY BETTER FORM
ga1ENQpm660_5 0 AGAIN THE C WITH THE SKIN AND BONES AND THE C DOWN HERE IS JUST THE SKELETAL IDEA BUT WHAT I WANT YOU TO NOTICE IS THAT THERE IS IN ALL OF THESE LETTERS WHAT WE CALL A DUCTUS OR A LINING SEQUENCE
ga1ENQpm660_6 0 SO IT'S THE ORDER IN WHICH YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR STROKES
ga1ENQpm660_7 0 IN THE A IT'S ONE TWO THREE
ga1ENQpm660_8 0 IN THE B IT'S ONE TWO THREE AND IN THE C IT'S A NICE ROUNDED ROUNDED FEELING TO THIS LETTER AND WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO ABOUT HERE YOU'RE GOING TO GO A LITTLE BIT STRAIGHTER COME BACK UP TO HERE AND COME AROUND AND GO A LITTLE BIT STRAIGHTER
ga1ENQpm660_9 0 WHAT DO I MEAN BY STRAIGHTER
ga1ENQpm660_10 0 IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE CALL IT A STRAIGHT CURVE
ga1ENQpm660_11 0 IT'S INSTEAD OF STAYING ROUNDED AS YOU WOULD WITH THE O
ga1ENQpm660_12 0 SO HERE IS ONE OF THE FIRST SECRETS THAT I'M GOING TO REVEAL TO YOU
ga1ENQpm660_13 0 THERE'S A NATURAL PRINCIPLE THAT'S AT WORK WITH THE C IF WE CLOSE THIS C UP TOO MUCH IT'S GOING TO BE READ AS AN O
ga1ENQpm660_14 0 SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
gyh0IEd0MxI_1 0 HAMMER CURLS ARE THE SISTER TO THE BICEP CURL WHERE WE WOULD HAVE EVERYTHING LINED UP SUPPINE TO YOUR BODY
gyh0IEd0MxI_2 0 WHAT YOU WILL DO IS TURN SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR THUMB TO THE SIDE MID LINE OF THE BODY JUST LIKE IF YOU WERE HOLDING ON TO A GOLF CLUB
gyh0IEd0MxI_3 0 BRINGING THE ELBOWS SLIGHTLY IN FRONT OF THE BODY SO OUR FOCUS IS GOING TO BE MORE FOREARM
gyh0IEd0MxI_4 0 IT ATTACHES INTO THAT BICEP THAT TWO HEADED MUSCLE BUT WE ARE REALLY GOING TO FOCUS ON MORE OF THE FOREARM WITH THIS AND CONTRACT AND RELEASE
gyh0IEd0MxI_5 0 NOW WITH VARIABLE TUBING RESISTANCE I'VE GOT RESISTANCE THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MOVEMENT COMING UP WITH MY CURL AND RELEASING COMING UP BOOM THERE IS PEAK CONTRACTION THERE IS REALLY NO NEED TO GO ANY FURTHER THAN THAT
gyh0IEd0MxI_6 0 I AM INVOLVING A LITTLE BIT OF THE BICEP AS WELL BUT AGAIN MORE FOREARM WITH THIS
gyh0IEd0MxI_7 0 FIST ELBOW SHOULDER IN LINE WORKING UNILATERAL
gyh0IEd0MxI_8 0 THE FURTHER AWAY I TAKE MY FOOT FROM THE BAND THE LESS RESISTANCE I'LL HAVE WORKING TEN TO FIFTEEN REPS THREE SETS ON EACH SIDE
GnRztm2H_qc_1 0 HI I'M LIZ HOOD ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND I'M TALKING TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO GIVE YOUR BABY A BATH AND IN THIS SEGMENT I'M GOING TO GO OVER SAFETY TIPS TO MAKE SURE YOUR BABY IS ABSOLUTELY SAFE AT ALL TIMES WHILE YOU ARE GIVING HIM A BATH HE OR SHE
GnRztm2H_qc_2 0 NOW ONE THING THAT I RECENTLY GOT IS THIS LITTLE FAUCET COVER IT INFLATES IT GOES OVER THE FAUCET AND THIS IS WHERE THE WATER COMES OUT
GnRztm2H_qc_3 0 IT JUST KIND OF KEEPS THAT FROM BEING ABLE TO BUMP THEIR HEAD ON THE FAUCET
GnRztm2H_qc_4 0 THERE IS SOME KIND OF SHARP METAL EDGES ON IT AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN HE IS A OLDER TODDLER THAT HE WON'T HIT HIS HEAD AGAINST IT
GnRztm2H_qc_5 0 BABIES YOU KNOW THEY CAN'T REALLY REACH OUT THAT FAR SO THIS WOULDN'T REALLY BE PROBLEM UNTIL THEY ARE TODDLER
GnRztm2H_qc_6 0 BUT YOU KNOW I FIGURE AND THIS IS KIND OF MY PHILOSOPHY ON ALL CHILD PROOFING IS THAT IF YOU CAN PAY FIVE DOLLARS FOR SOMETHING MAYBE IT IS MARKETING JUST TO GET YOU TO BUY MORE STUFF
GnRztm2H_qc_7 0 BUT I PERSONALLY THINK IF YOU CAN BUY SOMETHING FOR FIVE DOLLARS THAT IT KEEPS YOUR BABY FROM HITTING THEIR HEAD ON SOMETHING OR GETTING STITCHES AND THAT TO ME IS MONEY VERY WELL SPENT
GnRztm2H_qc_8 0 ONE THING THAT I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH IS THAT YOU NEED TO NEVER LEAVE THEM ALONE IN THE TUB
GnRztm2H_qc_9 0 THAT IS JUST YOU KNOW THERE IS NO ONE AROUND IT DO NOT LEAVE THEM ALONE IN THE TUB
GnRztm2H_qc_10 0 YOU CAN'T GO ANSWER THE PHONE ANSWER THE DOOR GO GET MORE SUPPLIES ANYTHING LIKE THAT
GnRztm2H_qc_11 0 EVEN IF THEY ARE IN A LITTLE BABY TUB OR WHATEVER
GnRztm2H_qc_12 0 CAUSE ONCE THEY START ROLLING OVER THEY CAN JUST FLIP OVER FLIP OUT OF IT AND THERE HAS BEEN CASES WHERE BABIES HAVE DROWNED IN LESS THEN THREE INCHES OF WATER
GnRztm2H_qc_13 0 SO IT DOES NOT MATTER HOW LITTLE WATER YOU HAVE IN THERE JUST MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT YOU NEVER LEAVE THEM ALONE IN THE WATER CAUSE THAT WOULD BE BAD
GnRztm2H_qc_14 0 ANOTHER THING IS THAT YOU NEED TO LOWER YOUR WATER TEMPERATURE FROM YOUR WATER HEATER DOWN TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DEGREES CELSIUS
GnRztm2H_qc_15 0 NOW I PERSONALLY HAVE A VERY OLD SCHOOL WATER HEATER THAT JUST HAVE KNOBS ENTITLED A B AND C WITH A BEING THE ONE OVER HOT AND THEN C IS HOTTEST
GnRztm2H_qc_16 0 SO I JUST HAVE MY SET ON A BUT NOT EVERYBODY HAS WATER HEATERS LIKE I DO
GnRztm2H_qc_17 0 SO IF YOURS IS MORE WATER YOU CAN ACTUALLY SET IT ON DIFFERENT DEGREES SO SET IT AT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DEGREES CELSIUS OR LESS
GnRztm2H_qc_18 0 THIS IS SO IF YOU JUST NEED TO POUR A LITTLE BIT MORE HOT WATER INTO THE BATH WHILE THE BABY IS IN IT JUST TO KIND OF WARM THEM UP YOU WANT TO KEEP THEM MORE COMFORTABLE YOU CAN DO THAT WITHOUT WORRY OF THE WATER BEING SO HOT THAT IT MIGHT SCOLD
GnRztm2H_qc_19 0 ALSO WHEN THEY GET A LITTLE BIT OLDER AND THEY START TO GETTING UP THERE AND TRYING TO WASH THEIR HANDS OR GET THEIR OWN WATER THEY WON'T ACTUALLY SCOLD THEIR SELVES ON WATER THAT IS TOO HOT
GnRztm2H_qc_20 0 ANOTHER THING THAT I LIKE TO DO IS I LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND FILL THE BATH BEFORE HE GETS IN IT THAT WAY I CAN MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT IT IS NOT TOO HOT
GnRztm2H_qc_21 0 SINCE I HAVE THE WATER HEATER SET CORRECTLY I KNOW THAT IT WON'T SCOLD HIM IF IT IS TOO HOT BUT YOU KNOW I JUST DON'T WANT HIM TO GET BURNED JUST EVEN A LITTLE BIT
GnRztm2H_qc_22 0 SO IT IS GOOD TO GO AHEAD AND SET HIM IN THE BATHTUB IN THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE BEFORE YOU SIT YOUR BABY IN THERE
GnRztm2H_qc_23 0 SO IF YOU ABY BY THESE SAFETY TIPS EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A GOOD TIME AND BABY WOULD ENJOY IT
hjCfkxlbOTs_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'LL BE SPEAKING ABOUT THE REGIONS WHERE RUM IS DISTILLED
hjCfkxlbOTs_2 0 THE EPICENTER OF RUM PRODUCTION IS IN THE CARIBBEAN NAMELY BARBADOS THEY ARE KNOWN FOR A LIGHT-BODIED RUM WHICH IS SINGLE DISTILLED IN A COLUMN STILL
hjCfkxlbOTs_3 0 ALSO CUBA IS KNOWN FOR ITS LIGHT-BODIED RUM
hjCfkxlbOTs_4 0 WHEREAS THE DOMINICA REPUBLIC AND HAITI ARE BETTER KNOWN FOR THEIR FULL-BODIED RUMS THOSE ARE DOUBLE DISTILLED IN HOT STILLS
hjCfkxlbOTs_5 0 THERE ARE ALSO AREAS SUCH AS JAMAICA WHICH PRODUCE A RICH AROMATIC RUM THAT IS DISTILLED IN A POT STILL AND PUERTO RICO WHERE LIGHT DRY RUMS ARE PRODUCED
hjCfkxlbOTs_6 0 AND PUERTO RICO SOMETHING TO NOTE THE LIGHT RUMS ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO BE DISTILLED FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR AND FOR THE DARK RUMS THOSE ARE REQUIRED TO BE DISTILLED FOR THREE YEARS
hjCfkxlbOTs_7 0 THERE IS ALSO A BIT OF RUM PRODUCTION IN OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS SOUTH AMERICA USA CANADA EUROPE AND AUSTRALIA ALTHOUGH NOT AS PREVALENT AS THE CARIBBEAN
hbPIMlVBFgM_1 0 HI I'M KAREN FOR EXPERT VILLAGE NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE CHOCOLATE ROSES THAT WE'RE GOING TO DECORATE OUR CAKE WITH
hbPIMlVBFgM_2 0 I'VE TAKEN OUR CHOCOLATE PASTE OUT OF THE REFRIGERATOR AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S GOTTEN VERY HARD AND FIRM
hbPIMlVBFgM_3 0 WE CAN YOU USE THIS TO MOLD WITH IT IS VERY TEMPERATURE SENSITIVE SO YOU HAVE TRY NOT TO HANDLE IT TO MUCH AND YOU HAVE TO PUT IT BACK INTO THE REFRIGERATOR FROM TIME TO TIME AS YOUR WORKING WITH IT IF YOU FIND THAT IT BECOMES TO SOFT
hbPIMlVBFgM_4 0 TO DO THE ROSE WE'LL START WITH A SMALL PIECE ABOUT A SIZE OF A MARBLE
hbPIMlVBFgM_5 0 AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO PINCH THAT INTO A SORT OF LONG POINTED SHAPE LIKE THIS AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S ALREADY MELTING IN MY HAND
hbPIMlVBFgM_6 0 AND WE'LL PUT THAT TO THE SIDE I'M WORKING ON A PIECE OF BAKING PAPER WHICH IS NON STICK BAKING PAPER

hbPIMlVBFgM_9 0 YOU SORT OF HAVE THIS SIZE SHAPE AND YOU CAN SMOOTH THAT OUT WITH A KNIFE
hbPIMlVBFgM_10 0 NOW YOUR GOING TO LIFT THAT UP SEE IT'S VERY SOFT AND WERE GOING TO TAKE OUR CENTER AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO WRAP THAT PEDAL AROUND THE CENTER AND REMOVE A BIT AT THE END AND WE'LL PUT THAT TO THE SIDE
hbPIMlVBFgM_11 0 LET THAT SIT WHILE WE'RE DOING OUR NEXT PIECE
gd_8AKjRsJo_1 0 ALRIGHT THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO MORE IN DEPTH WHEN YOU'RE GO TO HIT A JUMP YOU DON'T WANT TO GO AFTER JUMP
gd_8AKjRsJo_2 0 WHEN YOU GO AFTER JUMP YOU DON'T WANT TO ME LEANING FORWARD TOO MUCH AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LEANING BACK TOO MUCH YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY WITH THE ANGLE OF THE JUMP
gd_8AKjRsJo_3 0 THEN ONCE YOU GET IN THE AIR YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR KNEES BENT KEEP YOUR ARMS OUT SO THAT YOU CAN KEEP YOUR BALANCE WHEN YOU'RE IN THE AIR
gd_8AKjRsJo_4 0 AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU RIGHT HERE A LITTLE BIT THAT ICY AWFUL JUMP

gd_8AKjRsJo_6 0 MAYBE I CAN DO SOMETHING ELSE OF THIS
gd_8AKjRsJo_7 0 SO KEEP YOUR ARMS OUT LIKE I DID IT HELPS WITH SPINNING IF YOU GET INTO THAT
gd_8AKjRsJo_8 0 AND YOUR APPROACH IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
gd_8AKjRsJo_9 0 THAT PROBABLY SETS HOW YOU WILL BE IN THE AIR AND HOW YOU WILL BE WHEN YOU LAND
GDMxgIOHHVs_1 0 NOW THAT THE BRONZER IS ON WE WANT TO DO A LITTLE BLUSH
GDMxgIOHHVs_2 0 THE BLUSH I'M GOING TO USE IS GOING TO ACT AS ALSO A FACE HIGHLIGHTER

GdUdYxe9vtk_2 0 WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT WITH SPACKLE AND CAULKING
GdUdYxe9vtk_3 0 FIRST I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU THE SPACKLING
GdUdYxe9vtk_4 0 I HAVE SELECTED A LIGHTWEIGHT SPACKLE AND A SMALL PUTTY KNIFE AND THERE ARE SMALL AREAS SO THIS IS GOING TO BE JUST THE THING

GdUdYxe9vtk_18 0 GET ENOUGH IN THERE MORE THAN YOU NEED AND THEN FINISH IT BY WIPING IT RIGHT OFF

hADcB9vMpuQ_1 0 HELLO THIS IS MARK BOWERS FROM BOWER'S PHOTOGRAPHY IN AMERICAN FORK AT BOWER'S PHOTOGRAPHY.COM AND IN THIS SECTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIGHTING FOR MACRO PHOTOGRAPHY
hADcB9vMpuQ_2 0 THE KEY FOR MACRO PHOTOGRAPHY IS THAT IT REQUIRES MORE LIGHT THAN NORMAL
hADcB9vMpuQ_3 0 AS THE LENS ZOOMS UP ON ON SOMETHING THAT'S SMALLER IT REQUIRES MORE LIGHT TO GET A DECENT PHOTOGRAPH OF IT
hADcB9vMpuQ_4 0 LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING I JUST DID LAST YEAR
hADcB9vMpuQ_5 0 IT'S A WEED THAT I FOUND OUT BEHIND FOUND BEHIND MY HOUSE
hADcB9vMpuQ_6 0 PUT THE CAMERA ON A TRIPOD AND PHOTOGRAPHED THIS
hADcB9vMpuQ_7 0 IT'S THE TYPE OF WEED THAT AS YOU BLOW ON IT THE LITTLE SEEDS BLOW OFF IN THE DISTANCE
hADcB9vMpuQ_8 0 BUT WHAT I USED TO GET THE SHOT WAS A SET OF CLOSE UP FILTERS
hADcB9vMpuQ_9 0 AND NOW CLOSE UP FILTERS ARE ARE FILTERS THAT YOU SET THAT YOU SCREW ON THE FRONT OF YOUR CAMERA LENS AND THEY BRING OBJECTS CLOSER
hADcB9vMpuQ_10 0 MANY TIMES YOUR LENS JUST CANNOT FOCUS CLOSE ENOUGH TO GET A GOOD MACRO SHOT
hADcB9vMpuQ_11 0 AND THIS IS JUST AN EASY WAY TO DO THIS
hADcB9vMpuQ_12 0 IF YOU'RE IN THE STUDIO AND YOU'RE LIGHTING THIS MACRO PHOTOGRAPHY YOU HAVE TO BRING THE LIGHTS IN CLOSER AND ADD MORE LIGHT TO GET A GOOD PHOTOGRAPHS OF SMALL OBJECTS

H8uv_Jh7Xw0_1 0 EMIL LAMPRECHT NOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SHOWER PATTERN VARIATIONS YOU CAN MAKE
H8uv_Jh7Xw0_2 0 I'VE SHOWN YOU THE STACK MULTIPLEX BUT YOU CAN ALSO MAKE A STACK-LIKE EFFECT WITH THE HEIGHT OF YOUR THROWS
H8uv_Jh7Xw0_3 0 THIS IS AN EXAMPLE
H8uv_Jh7Xw0_4 0 ONCE YOU GET INTO YOUR PATTERN YOU CAN THROW THEM HIGH ENOUGH AND A SPLIT DIFFERENCE ENOUGH THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A SMALL SHOWER PATTERN OF THREE GOING ON UNDER YOUR FOUR
H8uv_Jh7Xw0_5 0 YOU CAN GO TO AN EVEN MORE EXTREME DIFFERENCE BY THROWING ONE VERY HIGH A MEDIUM HEIGHT AND THEN A LOW HEIGHT WITH A VERY SMALL EXCHANGE AT THE BOTTOM
H8uv_Jh7Xw0_6 0 YOU END UP WITH THIS GREAT KIND OF ONE-SIDE STACK COMING DOWN WHICH STILL MAINTAINS WITHIN THE SHOWER PATTERN BECAUSE YOU'RE VAMPING AND THROWING FROM ONE HAND
H8uv_Jh7Xw0_7 0 THAT'S A SHOWER VARIATION
H8uv_Jh7Xw0_8 0 OTHER THINGS YOU CAN DO IS MIX PATTERNS LIKE THAT WITH YOUR MULTIPLEXES TO CREATE A VERY INTERESTING VISUAL EFFECT
H8uv_Jh7Xw0_9 0 AND DON'T FORGET THAT SWITCHING SIDES CAN ADD EVEN MORE DYNAMIC TO THE TRICK
heTSXqiQ8Yg_1 0 NOW WE ARE GOING TO PUT LINE ON A CONVENTIONAL REEL
heTSXqiQ8Yg_2 0 IT IS NOT THAT BIG A TASK
heTSXqiQ8Yg_3 0 YOU JUST HAVE TO LEARN TO TIE A KNOT SO THAT IT IS SNUG TO THE SPOOL
heTSXqiQ8Yg_4 0 YOU DON'T WANT A LOOSE LINE AT THE BOTTOM OTHERWISE THE WHOLE SPOOL IS GOING TO BE LOOSE WHEN YOU GET THROUGH WITH IT SO THIS KNOT BASICALLY IS WHAT I CALL A NAIL KNOT
heTSXqiQ8Yg_5 0 TAKE THE LINE YOU PINCH IT AND YOU LEAVE A LITTLE BIT OF LOOP HERE AND IT MAKES A GOOD FISHING KNOT TOO AND WE ARE GOING TO PUT THE SHORT END ON THE TOP AND LEAVE A LITTLE BIT OFF FOR THE NAIL HERE AND I AM GOING TO WRAP IT AROUND THREE TIMES THAT'S THREE AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO PINCH
heTSXqiQ8Yg_6 0 WE ARE KEEPING THE LOOPS IN FORMATION BY PINCHING MY OTHER HAND NOW AND I AM GOING TO TAKE THIS TAB END OR THE SHORT END AND WE WILL GO FROM THE OUTSIDE IN AND WE ARE GOING TO RUN THAT THING THROUGH THE LOOP AND KIND OF GET THAT LOOP THE SAME SIZE AS THE OTHER LOOPS AND JUST KIND OF PULL EVERYTHING RIGHT ON DOWN JUST LIKE THAT
heTSXqiQ8Yg_7 0 THIS IS GOING TO SLIDE KEEP IN MIND NOW THIS KNOT IS GOING TO BE WRAPPED AROUND THE SPOOL BEFORE YOU TIE IT AND IT IS GOING TO SLIDE DOWN THE ARMOR OF THE SPOOL AND TIGHTEN UP
heTSXqiQ8Yg_8 0 AND THEN AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME YOU ARE GOING TO BE READY TO PUT THE LINE ON THE SPOOL PROBABLY BY HAVING SOMEBODY HOLD THIS SPOOL SO YOU HAVE ADEQUATE TENSION WHEN YOU ARE PUTTING THE LINE ON THE CONVENTIONAL REEL
gPUEg2NbtBw_1 0 I KNOW I'VE SAID MANY MANY TIMES THAT THIS IS MY FAVORITE TECHNIQUE AGAIN THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE TECHNIQUES
gPUEg2NbtBw_2 0 THE ONE WE JUST DID WAS KOKYU NAGE WITH TENKAN NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT WITH IRIMI
gPUEg2NbtBw_3 0 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU CUT THE ELBOW DOWN WITH THIS
gPUEg2NbtBw_4 0 THIS IS VERY HEDITOSHI-LIKE BECAUSE AS THEY COME HERE I'VE GOT TO GET HIM TURNING AWAY FROM ME AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT LIKE THIS
gPUEg2NbtBw_5 0 IT JUST WON'T WORK
gPUEg2NbtBw_6 0 YOU HAVE TO HAVE FULL COMMITMENT TO THIS WHICH IS WHY I CALL THIS IRIMI KOKYU NAGE IRIMI
gPUEg2NbtBw_7 0 CUTTING WHAM JUST LIKE THIS
gPUEg2NbtBw_8 0 AS THE BODY TURNS TO FALL AWAY FROM ME I JUST FOLLOW IT UP STEPPING THROUGH
gPUEg2NbtBw_9 0 NOW I CAN TURN INTO KOKYU NAGE TENKAN AND COME BACK TO KOKYU NAGE IRIMI
gPUEg2NbtBw_10 0 SEVERAL DIFFERENT HAND POSITIONS YOU CAN DO ON THIS ONE ALSO
gPUEg2NbtBw_11 0 FROM HERE YOU CAN CUT HERE AND GO LIKE THIS
gPUEg2NbtBw_12 0 YOU CAN CUT UNDERNEATH THE ARM
gPUEg2NbtBw_13 0 ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE TO DO IS GO TO THE FACE
gPUEg2NbtBw_14 0 SO FROM HERE AND IT CAN BE A STRIKE IF YOU WANT BAM OR IT CAN JUST BE GUIDING IT THROUGH
gPUEg2NbtBw_15 0 YOU'LL SEE HOW I USE THESE TWO IN CONJUNCTION IRIMI AND TENKAN
glefpO6HQDg_1 0 USING SELF MADE BOOKS
glefpO6HQDg_2 0 YOU CAN START OUT FROM THE BEGINNING TEACHING A CHILD THE CORRECT WAY TO HANDLE A BOOK WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT YOUR REAL BOOKS THAT YOU PAID FOR TO LAST MUCH LONGER DOWN THE ROAD
glefpO6HQDg_3 0 TELL THEM THAT THE SEAM OR THE COVER ALWAYS GOES TO THE LEFT AND YOU CAN TEACH THEM THEIR LEFT AND RIGHT HANDS AT THE SAME TIME SO THAT THEY DON'T TAKE THE BOOK AND START IT FROM THE BACK WHICH IS VERY NATURAL AND THEY WOULD EVEN PUT IT UPSIDE DOWN IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FACT THAT THE PICTURE WOULD BE UPSIDE DOWN
glefpO6HQDg_4 0 SO TEACH THEM HOW TO HOLD A BOOK TEACH THEM TO ALWAYS READY THE TITLE AND THE AUTHOR AND THE ILLUSTRATOR
glefpO6HQDg_5 0 SOMETIMES I WOULD PUT WRITTEN BY ME OR BY MY NAME AND THEN ILLUSTRATED BY ME AND ILLUSTRATED IS A HARD WORD THEY'LL JUST SAY THAT'S ILLUSTRATED JUST SAY ILLUSTRATED
glefpO6HQDg_6 0 SO THEY READ THE TITLE THEY READ WHO IT'S BY THEY READ THE ILLUSTRATOR
glefpO6HQDg_7 0 THEN THEY OPEN THE FIRST PAGE AND YOU CAN TEACH THEM ABOUT DEDICATION PAGES AND COPYRIGHT AND ALL THAT STUFF DOWN THE ROAD
glefpO6HQDg_8 0 BUT OUR BOOKS START HERE AND THEY START READING
glefpO6HQDg_9 0 TEACH THEM NEVER TO FOLD A BOOK BACKWARDS LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT BREAKS THE BINDING
glefpO6HQDg_10 0 TEACH THEM ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN THINK OF TO TREAT BOOKS CORRECTLY
glefpO6HQDg_11 0 BOOKS ARE VERY IMPORTANT BOOKS ARE TO BE TREASURED TEACH THEM TO LOVE BOOKS FROM THE BEGINNING
glefpO6HQDg_12 0 AND THEY START READING
glefpO6HQDg_13 0 TRACKING TEACH THEM TO TAKE THEIR FINGER PUT IT UNDERNEATH EACH WORD AS THEY READ IT THAT WILL HELP FOR A LONG TIME
glefpO6HQDg_14 0 IT'S KIND OF LIKE TRAINING WHEELS THEY DON'T DO IT FOREVER BUT IT HELPS IN THE BEGINNING
glefpO6HQDg_15 0 A CAT SAT
glefpO6HQDg_16 0 AND THEY WILL SAY A C-A-T CAT AND IF THEY COULDN'T GET IT YOU WILL HAVE THEM COVER ALL BUT THE FIRST WORD AND YOU TREAT THIS WORD AS INDIVIDUAL TELL THEM NOT TO LOOK AT ANYTHING ELSE UNTIL THEY'VE MASTERED THAT WORD
glefpO6HQDg_17 0 WHEN THEY GET IT HAVE THEM START OVER AND READ FROM THE BEGINNING A CAT SAT
glefpO6HQDg_18 0 ONCE THEY WORK THAT OUT HAVE THEM READ THE WHOLE THING
glefpO6HQDg_19 0 A CAT SAT
glefpO6HQDg_20 0 TADA LOOK AT THE PICTURE
glefpO6HQDg_21 0 AS I'M MAKING THESE BOOKS I TRY NOT TO MAKE THE PICTURE TOO OBVIOUS THAT THEY CAN JUST GUESS BY LOOKING AT THE PICTURES
glefpO6HQDg_22 0 SOMETIMES I'LL PUT MORE THINGS IN THE PICTURE LIKE ANOTHER DOG OR A RAT OR SOMETHING SO THAT THEY CAN'T AUTOMATICALLY GUESS WHAT IT IS
glefpO6HQDg_23 0 THE PICTURE IS THE DELIGHT AFTER THEY FINISH READING THE CORRECT SENTENCE TO TELL THEM YES I READ IT CORRECTLY AND LOOK AT THAT COOL LITTLE CAT THAT MOMMY OR DADDY OR SOMETHING DREW
glefpO6HQDg_24 0 THAT LOOKS VERY FUNNY MAYBE I COULD DO A BETTER JOB IN A YEAR BUT IN ANY CASE THAT'S HOW IT WORKS AND THERE WE HAVE USING SELF MADE BOOKS
glefpO6HQDg_25 0 AGAIN ONCE AGAIN KEEP THEM ON A SHELF KEEP THEM IN THE SAME PLACE ALL THE TIME TEACH YOUR CHILDREN TO TREASURE BOOKS
gnbL9dpsksA_1 0 HI THIS IS MARY WITH EXPERTVILLAGE.COM AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE GERIATRIC DOG THE OLDER DOG
gnbL9dpsksA_2 0 HOW OLD IS THAT YOU ASK
gnbL9dpsksA_3 0 WELL SOME OF IT DEPENDS ON THE BREED BUT MOSTLY IF YOU'VE GOT A DOG WHO'S SEVEN YEARS OF AGE IN HUMAN TERMS OR OLDER YOU'VE GOT A GERIATRIC DOG
gnbL9dpsksA_4 0 THIS LITTLE ONE RIGHT HERE IS THIRTEEN SO SHE'S DEFINITELY A GERIATRIC DOG
gnbL9dpsksA_5 0 ONE OF THE BIG THINGS YOU CAN DO FOR A GERIATRIC DOG IS TO WORK THEIR CHEST AREA
gnbL9dpsksA_6 0 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU DO IS PULL THEIR FORELEGS APART LIKE THIS AND THAT HELPS TO STIMULATE THE WHOLE LUNG AND THE CHEST AREA
gnbL9dpsksA_7 0 THEN YOU'RE GOING TO DO RUBBING MOTIONS
gnbL9dpsksA_8 0 YOU'RE GOING TO RUB IN A CIRCULAR LIGHT GENTLE EASY CLOCKWISE MOTION
gnbL9dpsksA_9 0 PLEASE MAKE SURE IT'S CLOCKWISE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM WORKS AND YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO GO AGAINST THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM OR YOU MIGHT END UP WITH A LOT OF PROBLEMS

gMGV-baI3O0_2 0 IF YOU WANT TO CREATE YOUR OWN VIDEO RESUME YOU CAN AND DO IT AT NO COST
gMGV-baI3O0_3 0 IF YOU HAVE A WEB CAM CAMCORDER OR DIGITAL CAMERA WITH MOVIE MODE YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN VIDEO RESUME

gMGV-baI3O0_5 0 IF YOU WANT A PROFESSIONAL TO FILM YOUR VIDEO RESUME THEN VISIT FILMMYRESUME.COM AND SEE A LIST OF LOCAL VIDEOGRAPHERS
G_bLKrk709I_1 0 SO FOR A SMALLER BREED DOG I WOULD FILL THE SYRINGE TO FOR 1/2 TABLESPOON
G_bLKrk709I_2 0 YOU WOULD OPEN THE DOGS MOUTH OPEN TOWARDS THE CHEEK AND INSERT IT IN AND THEN YOU CAN GIVE THEM THE COUGH SYRUP
G_bLKrk709I_3 0 PROBABLY TALK TO YOUR VETERINARIAN ABOUT HOW FREQUENTLY YOU SHOULD GIVE THE COUGH SYRYUP AND MOST VETERINARIAN'S DO RECOMMEND GIVING COUGH SYRUP FOR SEVERE COUGHING
G_bLKrk709I_4 0 IF YOUR DOG IS CONTINUING TO COUGH AND IS GETTING LETHARGIC THEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO PUT THE DOG ON ANTIBIOTICS
G_bLKrk709I_5 0 AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOUR VET IS GOING TO DETERMINE BUT IT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO PUT YOUR DOGS ON COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T BECOME MORE SERIOUS INFECTION
G_bLKrk709I_6 0 IF YHOU FIND THAT YOUR DOG IS VERY LETHARGIC AND BREATHING VERY SHALLOWLY THEN YOU WANT TO BRING THEM TO THE VETERINARIAN SPECIALIST
G_bLKrk709I_7 0 THEY ARE PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE LUNG X-RAYS AND TEST WITH OXYGEN LEVELS
G_bLKrk709I_8 0 IF THE DOG IS TRYING TO AVOID COUGHING WHEN COUGHING BECOMES VERY UNCOMFORTABLE THE DOG CAN START TO AVOID COUGHING BY TAKING SHALLOW BREATHS AND THE MORE SHALLOW BREATH THEY TAKE THE LESS OXYGEN IS COMING IN AND IT WILL ACTUALLY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF BLOOD OXYGEN IN THEIR BODY
G_bLKrk709I_9 0 SO IF THE CASE BECOMES VERY EXTREME THE DOG MIGHT NEED SOME MEDICAL ATTENTION
G_bLKrk709I_10 0 THEY MIGHT NEED TO HAVE OXYGEN PLACED INTER NASALLY
G_bLKrk709I_11 0 THEY MIGHT NEED TO BE ON IV-FLUIDS
G_bLKrk709I_12 0 A KENNEL COUGH CAN BE SOMETHING THAT IS FAIRLY MILD AND DOGS GET OVER IN A DAY OR TWO AND IT CAN BE SOMETHING THAT WILL CAUSE YOUR DOG TO WIND UP IN THE HOSPITAL FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND WE JUST TALKED ABOUT A COUPLE OF THINGS TO DO TO HELP CARE FOR THEM
h4eS2jw8DA8_1 0 MY NAME IS KATE JAMES I'M A COMPOUNDING PHARMACIST IN EUGENE OREGON AT BROADWAY APOTHECARY
h4eS2jw8DA8_2 0 AND NOW I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS AND SOME OF THE NOT SO WONDERFUL THINGS AS FAR AS BEING A PHARMACIST GOES
h4eS2jw8DA8_3 0 GREAT THINGS ARE YOU GET TO WORK WITH PEOPLE
h4eS2jw8DA8_4 0 ONE OF THE BAD THINGS IS YOU GET TO WORK WITH PEOPLE
h4eS2jw8DA8_5 0 THAT CAN BE A PLUS AND A MINUS
h4eS2jw8DA8_6 0 SOME A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WE DEAL WITH THEY'RE SICK THEY DON'T FEEL WELL THEY'RE NOT VERY HAPPY ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR PRESCRIPTIONS AS FAR AS INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENT RATES GOES
h4eS2jw8DA8_7 0 SO THAT CAN BE A DIFFICULT THING BUT IT'S ALSO A WONDERFUL THING BECAUSE YOU GET TO BUILD A RELATIONSHIP WITH PEOPLE
h4eS2jw8DA8_8 0 ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITY PHARMACY WHETHER YOU'RE IN A CHAIN OR INDEPENDENT OR THAT TYPE OF SETTING
h4eS2jw8DA8_9 0 YOU REALLY GET TO KNOW PEOPLE AND HELP THEM AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THEIR MEDICINE OVER TIME
h4eS2jw8DA8_10 0 AND THAT'S A REALLY NEAT FEELING
h4eS2jw8DA8_11 0 YOU REALLY BECOME A PART OF THE COMMUNITY AS THEIR PHARMACIST
h4eS2jw8DA8_12 0 ANOTHER GREAT THING ABOUT BEING A PHARMACIST IS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO SET THEIR SCHEDULES FAIRLY NICELY
h4eS2jw8DA8_13 0 THERE'S A LOT OF PART TIME WORK AVAILABLE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE APPRECIATE THAT
h4eS2jw8DA8_14 0 THEY ARE ABLE TO REALLY PURSUE THEIR INTERESTS AND ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE OF WORK AND THE PHARMACY CAREER ALLOWS FOR THAT QUITE NICELY
h4eS2jw8DA8_15 0 OTHER CONS I WOULD SAY INSURANCE IS A CON
h4eS2jw8DA8_16 0 THAT'S NOT A WONDERFUL THING TO DEAL WITH
h4eS2jw8DA8_17 0 IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE ALWAYS STRUGGLING AND IT'S AN UPHILL BATTLE TO TRY AND GET PEOPLE WHAT THEY NEED AND THAT CAN KIND OF DRAG YOU DOWN SOME DAYS
h4eS2jw8DA8_18 0 AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS WORK LOAD
h4eS2jw8DA8_19 0 THAT WOULD BE A CON
h4eS2jw8DA8_20 0 IT TURNS OUT THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY WITH THE BABY BOOMERS COMING ON ARE NEEDING MEDICATIONS
h4eS2jw8DA8_21 0 AND SO YOU CAN HAVE A VERY BUSY VERY JAM PACKED DAY
h4eS2jw8DA8_22 0 SOMETIMES BREAKS AND LUNCHES JUST DON'T HAPPEN AND YOU LEARN TO DEAL WITH THAT
h4eS2jw8DA8_23 0 BUT OVERALL IT'S VERY REWARDING BECAUSE YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT YOU'RE HELPING SOMEBODY OR EDUCATING SOMEBODY AND YOU'RE ENABLING SOMEBODY TO HAVE A NICE HEALTHY LIFE
gZQQqykotQE_1 0 HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
gZQQqykotQE_2 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS SOMETIMES WE ARE GOING TO HAVE OUR CORNERBACKS PLAYING IN A SITUATION WE CALL BUMP AND RUN COVERAGE
gZQQqykotQE_3 0 IT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE
gZQQqykotQE_4 0 THE CORNERBACK IS GOING TO COME UP AND HE IS GOING TO BUMP AND THEN WHEN THIS GUY RUNS HE IS GOING TO STAY WITH HIM
gZQQqykotQE_5 0 THAT IS WHERE WE GET BUMP AND RUN COVERAGE FROM
gZQQqykotQE_6 0 NOW THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS THAT YOU CAN DO BUMP AND RUN COVERAGE
gZQQqykotQE_7 0 ONE WAY IS IF YOU HAVE A CORNERBACK LIKE THIS ONE THAT IS BIG AND STRONG AND CAN KEEP THIS GUY FROM GETTING IN THE PLAY THEN WE CAN PLAY BUMP AND RUN COVERAGE
gZQQqykotQE_8 0 IF YOU HAVE GOT AN UNDERSIZED CORNERBACK THEN YOU CAN'T USE BUMP AND RUN COVERAGE BECAUSE HE IS GOING TO GET ABUSED
gZQQqykotQE_9 0 SO THIS GUY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO COME UP HE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A GOOD CHECK AT THE INITIAL LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND WHAT HE IS TRYING TO DO IS TO PREVENT THIS GUY FROM GETTING INTO ANY KIND OF PATTERN
gZQQqykotQE_10 0 ALSO ONE THING THAT THIS WORKS GREAT WITH IS IN SHORT YARDAGE SITUATIONS
gZQQqykotQE_11 0 IT ALSO WORKS GOOD IF WE HAVE A LINEBACKER ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT IS BLITZING AND WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE GETTING TO THE QUARTERBACK QUICKLY
gZQQqykotQE_12 0 ALL WE WANT TO DO IS HOLD THIS GUY UP SO THAT THE QUARTERBACK CANNOT MAKE A PASS
gZQQqykotQE_13 0 SO IT IS GOING TO LOOK A LITTLE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
gZQQqykotQE_15 0 HE IS GOING TO CHECK HIM AND HE IS GOING TO STAY WITH HIM
gZQQqykotQE_16 0 NOW REMEMBER ONCE YOU GET PAST FIVE YARDS YOU CAN NO LONGER MAKE CONTACT WITH THAT GUY YOU HAVE JUST GOT TO RUN WITH HIM
gZQQqykotQE_17 0 BUT THE MAIN THING WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS TO KEEP HIM FROM GETTING OFF THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND TO SLOW THE PLAY DOWN SO THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET TO THE OTHER TEAM'S QUARTERBACK
GmXc6qvdMG8_1 0 HEY MY NAME IS ADDISON FROM CAPTAIN BILL'S AND I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO OVERHAND SERVE A VOLLEYBALL
GmXc6qvdMG8_2 0 IN ORDER TO OVERHAND SERVE A VOLLEYBALL THERE ARE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT MECHANICS THAT YOU NEED TO USE
GmXc6qvdMG8_3 0 FIRST THINGS FIRST YOU WANT TO ALWAYS KEEP YOUR HAND OPEN
GmXc6qvdMG8_4 0 WHEN YOU KEEP YOUR HAND OPEN YOU HAVE MORE SURFACE AREA ON THE BALL WHICH CAN HELP YOU TO GUIDE THE BALL TO WHERE YOU WANT IT TO GO ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE COURT
GmXc6qvdMG8_5 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE SERVING THE BALL YOU WANT YOUR HAND OUT IN FRONT OF YOU AND YOU WANT TO TOSS THE BALL UP IN FRONT OF YOU SO YOU HAVE TOP STEP AND HIT IT WITH YOUR HAND
GmXc6qvdMG8_6 0 WHEN YOU CONTACT THE BALL YOU WANT TO HIT IT ALMOST TO THE HEEL OF YOUR PALM AND IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR HAND
GmXc6qvdMG8_7 0 SO WHEN YOU TOSS THE BALL YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR ELBOW BACK AND WHEN YOU HIT YOU LEAD WITH YOUR ELBOW
GmXc6qvdMG8_8 0 SO YOU NEVER LEAD WITH YOUR HAND YOU WANT TO ALWAYS LEAD WITH YOUR ELBOW IT WILL HELP YOU TO GET THE BALL STRAIGHT OVER THE NET TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE SERVE
GmXc6qvdMG8_9 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE SERVING THE BALL TAKE THE BALL IN FRONT OF YOU TOSS IT IN FRONT OF YOU TAKE YOUR HAND BACK LEAD WITH YOUR ELBOW KEEP YOUR HAND OPEN AND SERVE THE BALL OVER THE NET
GmXc6qvdMG8_10 0 AND THAT IS HOW YOU OVERHAND SERVE A VOLLEYBALL
gX2rgOAw-N8_1 0 NOW YOU CAN TAKE THIS A LITTLE BIT DEEPER BY TAKING THAT LEFT FOOT IN AND TAKE THAT LEFT HAND AROUND THAT LEFT FOOT NOTE THE SHOULDER GO RIGHT BACK TOUCH THE FLOOR WITH THE RIGHT HAND LOOKING UP BREATH IN DEEP TO YOUR NOSE AND EXHALE
gX2rgOAw-N8_2 0 NOW RELEASE THAT GUIDE THE FLOOR RIGHT AWAY FROM YOU COME ALL THE WAY BACK UP
gX2rgOAw-N8_3 0 AND TAKE IT TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE WHERE THE LEFT FOOT GOES OUT OFF THE SIDES OF THE MAT TAKE THAT KNEE RIGHT DOWN INTO THE MAT
gX2rgOAw-N8_4 0 TAKE THE HANDS TO THE SIDES OF THE MAT EDGE THE RIGHT HEEL RIGHT BACK BRING YOUR HIP RIGHT BACK TO THE CENTER SO YOU'RE NOT LEANING OVER TOWARDS THE LEFT
gX2rgOAw-N8_5 0 BRING YOUR ARMS DOWN SUPPORT YOUR HEAD UPON YOUR FISTS YOUR HANDS ARE FLAT ON THE MAT
gX2rgOAw-N8_6 0 YOU CAN HOLD THIS UP TO LIKE THIRTY SECONDS IF YOU WISH TO JUST BREATH IN DEEP INTO YOUR NOSE AND EXHALE
gX2rgOAw-N8_7 0 ANOTHER DEEP BREATH IN LET THE BODY RELAX WITH THE BREATH EXHALE
gX2rgOAw-N8_8 0 NOW YOU CAN GUIDE THE FLOOR AWAY FROM YOU TAKE YOUR FINGERTIPS OFF THE SIDES OF THE MAT SHOULDERS GO BACK CHEST GOES FORWARD CHIN GOES UP
gX2rgOAw-N8_9 0 BREATHE IN DEEP TO YOUR NOSE AND EXHALE
gX2rgOAw-N8_10 0 ANOTHER DEEP BREATH IN EXHALE
gX2rgOAw-N8_11 0 NOW YOU CAN TAKE THIS ONE STEP FURTHER WITH THE RIGHT FOOT COMES IN RIGHT HAND TO THE RIGHT FOOT LEFT HAND TOUCHING THE FLOOR LET THE SHOULDERS GO BACK AND THE CHIN GO UP
gX2rgOAw-N8_12 0 BREATH IN DEEP TO YOUR NOSE AND EXHALE
gX2rgOAw-N8_13 0 HOLDING EACH ONE FOR THIRTY SECONDS IF YOU WISH
gX2rgOAw-N8_14 0 RELEASE THAT TOUCH THE FLOOR GUIDE THE FLOOR AWAY FROM YOU KNEES OUT TO THE SIDES OF THE MAT SIT BACK TOWARDS YOUR HEELS BRING YOUR HEAD RIGHT DOWN UPON YOUR FIST YOUR HANDS ALL FLAT IN THE MAT
gX2rgOAw-N8_15 0 JUST RELAX JUST BREATHE TO YOUR NOSE AND THEN GUIDE THE FLOOR AWAY FROM YOU AND COME UP
GDjA87z-pJE_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN BY EXTENDING YOUR LEFT LEG GROUNDING BOTH SIT BONES SO THAT WE FIND EQUAL THAT WE'RE LIFTING THE SPINE
GDjA87z-pJE_3 0 AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND STEP THE LEFT FOOT AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT AS CLOSE TO YOUR BOTTOM AS IS AVAILABLE TO YOU
GDjA87z-pJE_4 0 WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THE HEEL IN LINE WITH THE KNEE IN LINE WITH YOUR HIP
GDjA87z-pJE_5 0 AND THE INHALE THIS TIME IS GOING TO EXTEND THE LEFT ARM AND ON THE EXHALE WE'RE GOING TO OPEN TO THE LEFT TWISTING THE SPINE YOU CAN INVITE YOUR RIGHT HAND INTO THE RIGHT FOOT LENGTHENING THE SPINE TWISTING FROM BELOW THE RIGHT SHOULDER BLADE
GDjA87z-pJE_6 0 SHOULDERS ARE COMING DOWN CREATE LENGTH BETWEEN YOUR SHOULDERS AND YOUR EARS
GDjA87z-pJE_7 0 AGAIN BEING ABLE TO BREATHE AND RELAX IN YOUR POSES IS WHAT'S GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO DEEPEN YOUR POSES SO THAT OVER TIME YOU FEEL THE RELAXATION EFFECT OF YOGA
h8aK4gz4fM0_1 0 MY NAME IS OWEN ROTH AND IN THIS CLIP I'LL BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO PLACE THE CAMERA FOR A VIDEO INTERVIEW IF YOU HAVE NO CAMERAMAN
h8aK4gz4fM0_2 0 SO I AM HERE IN MY INDOOR LOCATION WHICH I'M GOING TO BE FILMING AND MY CAMERA AND A TRIPOD AND SINCE I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE OUTSIDE OF MY INTERVIEWEE WHO ISN'T HERE BUT THEY WILL BE AND I'M GOING TO PUT THEM OVER HERE AND THEY'LL BE SITTING IN THIS CHAIR
h8aK4gz4fM0_3 0 SO WE HAVE THIS BACKGROUND HERE CLOSE THE DOOR AND SINCE I HAVE A TRIPOD I'M GOING TO HAVE THE CAMERA ON THE TRIPOD
h8aK4gz4fM0_4 0 SO I DON'T HAVE TO HANDLE IT I'M JUST GOING TO PRESS THE RECORD BUTTON AND JUST LEAVE IT IN THE RIGHT FRAMING AND LET THEM TALK
h8aK4gz4fM0_5 0 AND I'M GOING TO SIT JUST TO THE SIDE OF THE CAMERA SO THEY'RE NOT LOOKING DIRECTLY AT THE CAMERA BECAUSE THAT KIND OF LEAVES A REALLY AWKWARD FEEL TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE VIEWING THE VIDEO WHEN THE PERSON GETTING INTERVIEWED IS LOOKING DIRECTLY AT THEM
h8aK4gz4fM0_6 0 SO YOU WANT THEIR EYE-LINE TO GO A LITTLE BIT TO THE SIDE SO YOU'LL WANT TO SIT A LITTLE BIT TO THE SIDE OF THEM SO THEY CAN LOOK OFF
h8aK4gz4fM0_7 0 AND IF YOU HAVE A MONITOR YOU CAN KIND OF PLAY WITH THIS
h8aK4gz4fM0_8 0 AND I'LL TURN THIS CAMERA ON AND SIT IN MYSELF SO YOU CAN GET AN IDEA
h8aK4gz4fM0_9 0 SO I FLIP THIS AND THEN SIT DOWN RIGHT HERE
h8aK4gz4fM0_10 0 SO IF I'M LOOKING AT THE CAMERA AND THIS IS WHERE I'M PLACING IF I WAS THE PERSON GETTING INTERVIEWED AND THEN WHEN I'M INTERVIEWING THE PERSON I'LL BE SITTING JUST OFF TO THE RIGHT OF THE CAMERA SO THE PERSON GETTING INTERVIEWED WOULD BE LOOKING AT ME AT THIS DIRECTION
h8aK4gz4fM0_11 0 AND AS YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE NOT LOOKING DIRECTLY AT THE CAMERA AND IT ISN'T AWKWARD SO THAT'S HOW I USUALLY DO MY INTERVIEWS WHEN I DON'T HAVE A CAMERAMAN
gFo6C1pT_ns_1 0 WHEN YOU'RE SETTING OUT TO CREATE YOUR CHARACTER AND CONCEPT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT NOT ONLY APPEALS TO YOURSELF BUT WILL APPEAL TO A WIDE VARIETY OF PEOPLE

HiUKaMTXjj8_2 0 WHAT ARE HIGHLIGHTS
HiUKaMTXjj8_3 0 IT'S FUNNY THAT YOU ASKED BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW
HiUKaMTXjj8_4 0 THEY THINK THAT ANYTHING IS A HIGHLIGHT ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR NATURAL HAIR COLOR
HiUKaMTXjj8_5 0 WHICH I GUESS IT'S TRUE BASICALLY WHAT A HIGHLIGHT IS IS ANYTHING THAT IS LIGHTER THAN YOUR NATURAL HAIR COLOR
HiUKaMTXjj8_6 0 SO ANYTHING THAT IS GOING TO GO THROUGH THE HAIR THAT IS GOING TO ADD A HIGHLIGHT WHAT A HIGHLIGHT DOES A HIGHLIGHT BRINGS OUT
HiUKaMTXjj8_7 0 SO IT ACTUALLY BRINGS OUT A TEXTURE SO AS YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN SEE THE MOVEMENT IN HER HAIR BECAUSE OF HER HIGHLIGHTS
HiUKaMTXjj8_8 0 WHEN GETTING HIGHLIGHTS YOU DO WANT TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION YOUR HAIR TEXTURE AND YOUR HAIR MOVEMENT
HiUKaMTXjj8_9 0 IF YOU HAVE CURLY HAIR THEN YOUR HIGHLIGHTS ARE GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT CHUNKIER A LITTLE BIT MORE CORK SCREW LIKE
HiUKaMTXjj8_10 0 IF YOU HAVE STRAIGHT HAIR WITH A LOT OF TEXTURE AND MOVEMENT THEN YOU CAN GET A LITTLE BIT CRAZIER WITH THE HIGHLIGHTS

GoIZ49XEZvw_1 0 HI I'M AMY MCCAULEY AND WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS HOW MUCH CARDIO IS ACTUALLY TOO MUCH CARDIO
GoIZ49XEZvw_2 0 YOU HAVE GOT A COUPLE O THINGS TO THINK ABOUT
GoIZ49XEZvw_3 0 IF YOUR GOAL IS TO GAIN MUSCLE AND MASS YOU ARE ONLY GOING TO WANT TO DO CARDIO ABOUT ONE TIME WEEK BECAUSE IF YOU DO TOO MUCH CARDIO IT COULD ACTUALLY TEAR DOWN THE MUSCLE AND MAKE THE MUSCLE GROUP SMALLER SO IF YOUR GOAL IS TO BUILD MASS YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO DO MORE WEIGHT TRAINING THAN YOU ARE CARDIOVASCULAR TRAINING
GoIZ49XEZvw_4 0 CARDIOVASCULAR TRAINING IS STILL NECESSARY BECAUSE YOU STILL NEED TO KEEP THAT HEART RATE UP AND YOUR CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM IN GOOD SHAPE SO TRY THAT ABOUT ONE DAY A WEEK MAYBE TWO DAYS A WEEK
GoIZ49XEZvw_5 0 IF YOUR GOAL IS TO GET LEAN THAT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORY TRY TO DO ABOUT FIVE TO SIX DAYS A WEEK ABOUT THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES SESSIONS AND YOU WANT TO TRY TO PUSH YOURSELF BETWEEN THE 75 AND EIGHTY PERCENTILE OF YOUR MAXIMUM HEART RATE SO A GOOD THING TO DO IS TO HECK THE HEART RATE ON THE MONITORS THAT ARE ON THE EQUIPMENT THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR LOCAL GYM
GoIZ49XEZvw_6 0 IF YOU WANT TO JUST GAIN MUSCLE AND NOT BULK UP BUT JUST GAIN MUSCLE YOU WOULD TRY TO DO ABOUT THREE THIRTY MINUTE SESSIONS THREE DAYS A WEEK SO A COUPLE THINGS TO THINK ABOUT
GoIZ49XEZvw_7 0 MASS BUILDING IS ONE DAY TO TWO DAYS A WEEK ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES MAXIMUM
GoIZ49XEZvw_8 0 IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET LEAN YOU NEED TO DO FIVE TO SIX DAYS A WEEK AND THAT IS BETWEEN THIRTY AND SIXTY MINUTES AND TO JUST GAIN OVERALL MUSCLE IS ABOUT THREE SESSIONS OF ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES A WEEK
GoIZ49XEZvw_9 0 THAT IS HOW YOU CAN DECIDE IF YOU ARE HAVING TOO MUCH CARDIO
_Hfz7EGLMP0_1 0 CHAIR POSE IT'S A WAY TO START USING THE LOWER BODY AND JUST LIKE IN ANY MOVEMENT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO YOU'RE GOING TO BE ACTIVATING THAT CENTER OF GRAVITY OR YOUR CORE STRENGTH
_Hfz7EGLMP0_2 0 SO THAT'S FIRST AND AFTER YOU'VE WORKED FROM HEAD NECK TO SHOULDERS YOU'RE READY TO START INCORPORATING SOME OF THAT LOWER BODY ON THE OTHER HALF OF THAT CENTER OF GRAVITY
_Hfz7EGLMP0_3 0 SO JUST LIKE YOU'RE SITTING IN A CHAIR KNEE IN LINE WITH THE ANKLE BEHIND THE TOES AT ALL TIMES JUST LIKE IN ANY LOWER BODY MOVEMENT
_Hfz7EGLMP0_4 0 SO YOU'VE GOT TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE KNEE JOINT
_Hfz7EGLMP0_5 0 YOU'RE GOING TO USE THAT A LOT
_Hfz7EGLMP0_6 0 AGAIN JUST PRACTICE SIMPLY BY HAVING YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR KNEES RESTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR HIPS AND PRESSING BACK LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO SIT IN THE CHAIR MAKING SURE YOU'RE AWARE KNEE BEHIND THE TOE AND IN LINE WITH THE ANKLE
_Hfz7EGLMP0_7 0 AGAIN THINK OF ACTIVE RANGE OF MOTION
_Hfz7EGLMP0_8 0 YOU'RE GOING TO FIND A POINT WHERE YOU STOP AND THAT'S ACTIVE RANGE OF MOTION BOOM RIGHT THERE
_Hfz7EGLMP0_9 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO FORCE IT ANY FURTHER THAN THAT
_Hfz7EGLMP0_10 0 LET'S JUST TRY CHAIR POSE WITHOUT ARMS JUST LET THEM RELAX BY YOUR SIDE
_Hfz7EGLMP0_13 0 AND YOUR FEET ARE GROUNDED AND YOU'VE GOT TO PUSH YOUR WEIGHT IN THE HEEL IN ORDER TO KEEP THAT KNEE BEHIND THE TOE
_Hfz7EGLMP0_14 0 UPPER BODY NICE AND STRAIGHT
_Hfz7EGLMP0_17 0 NOW IF WE DO THIS FROM LATERAL SIDE AND IF YOU'RE FEELING GOOD AND WARMED AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR BALANCE YOU CAN ADD IN THE ARMS
_Hfz7EGLMP0_19 0 AND EACH TIME YOU GET WARM WITH THIS YOU'RE GOING TO INCREASE YOUR RANGE OF MOTION AND GO DOWN A LITTLE FURTHER
_Hfz7EGLMP0_20 0 BUT ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU SIT BACK
_Hfz7EGLMP0_21 0 REACH FOR THAT CHAIR FIRST
_Hfz7EGLMP0_23 0 INHALE ON EXTENSION
_Hfz7EGLMP0_25 0 AND BY ABOUT THE FOURTH TIME YOU SHOULD FEEL A LOT MORE RANGE OF MOTION TOWARDS THAT CHAIR AND JUST KEEP AIMING FOR THE CHAIR
_Hfz7EGLMP0_27 0 YOU CAN DO ABOUT TEN TO TWELVE MAYBE FIFTEEN REPS AND THAT SHOULD GET THE LOWER BODY INCORPORATED INTO YOUR WARM-UP FUNCTIONALLY
gUhShIU58n8_1 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO START WITH ANOTHER BASIC MOVE ANOTHER WAITING MOVE

gUhShIU58n8_4 0 YOU CAN MIX AND MATCH HOWEVER YOU LIKE LATER ON ONCE YOU LEARN THE STEPS
gUhShIU58n8_5 0 THIS ONE'S SORT OF A HIP-HOPPING MOVE SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE WANT TO HAVE OUR LEFT AND OUR RIGHT HIPS CHANGING SIDES AND FACING THE FRONT

gUhShIU58n8_7 0 YOU WANT TO POP YOUR HIP OUT RIGHT HIP LEFT HIP RIGHT HIP
gUhShIU58n8_8 0 THE TRICK IS TO ALWAYS KEEP YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR RIGHT FOOT SO YOU'RE LEFT KNEE'S GOING TO BE THE ONE THAT'S BENDING THE WHOLE TIME
gUhShIU58n8_9 0 SO I'M HAVING MY WEIGHT ON THE BACK ON THE FRONT BACK FRONT BACK YOU'RE RIGHT LEG KIND OF STAYS STRAIGHT THERE
gUhShIU58n8_10 0 KEEP YOUR ARMS RELAXED THEY JUST KIND OF FLY UP OVER YOUR HEAD AND WHEREVER THEY LAND THERE'S FINE
gUhShIU58n8_11 0 SO WE CAN TRY THAT WITH THE DRUM RHYTHM A LITTLE BIT
gUhShIU58n8_13 0 SO JUST SIDE TO SIDE
gUhShIU58n8_14 0 AS YOU TURN SIDE TO SIDE YOU KIND OF WANT TO FACE THAT WAY A LITTLE BIT
gUhShIU58n8_15 0 AND IT'S A REALLY RELAXED MOVE
gUhShIU58n8_16 0 AND THAT'S GOOD
gVYYoX-QKHY_1 0 HI IT'S LAUREL AGAIN AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO ANOTHER TYPE OF PLATFORM SHOE
gVYYoX-QKHY_2 0 THIS ONE THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS THE OPEN-TOE CUTOUT PLATFORM AND THIS SPACE HERE THE WHITE IS ACTUALLY A CUTOUT THAT IF YOU WERE TO LOOK THROUGH IT YOU'D SEE WHATEVER IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT
gVYYoX-QKHY_3 0 IT'S CLEAR AND OPEN
gVYYoX-QKHY_4 0 THE ONLY STRUCTURE IS COMING FROM THIS PURPLISH BLUE PART THAT I HAVE DRAWN THAT'S THE FRAME AND THIS IS A HOLE BASICALLY
gVYYoX-QKHY_5 0 NOW IT'S TIME TO START DRAWING YOUR OPEN-TOE CUTOUT PLATFORM SHOE AND THE FIRST STEP IN THAT IS TO DECIDE HOW BIG AND HOW TALL YOU WANT THE ACTUAL PLATFORM PART TO BE
gVYYoX-QKHY_6 0 AND START OUT WITH THE BOTTOM PART OF IT SINCE THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF IT BEING A PLATFORM IS THAT IT HAS A PLATFORM
gVYYoX-QKHY_7 0 SO LET'S MAKE THIS ONE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER
gVYYoX-QKHY_8 0 WE'LL JUST EXAGGERATE IT HUGELY AND LIKE YOU SEE THERE I MADE A MISTAKE THAT'S OKAY
gVYYoX-QKHY_9 0 YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH TWENTY GAZILLION PAPER TRACING PIECES IN ORDER TO GET ONE PERFECT DESIGN AND I'M JUST TRYING TO SHOW YOU IT IN ONE GO WHICH IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE
gVYYoX-QKHY_10 0 THEN I HAVE A PEEP TOE HERE AND THEN AROUND THE HEEL
gVYYoX-QKHY_11 0 AND THEN YOU WOULD FIX IT AND MAKE IT A NICER LOOKING MORE FINISHED VERSION OF THE SAME THING
G5F-bwIsbFI_1 0 MY NAME'S RYAN PARKER WITH PARKER HOME RENOVATIONS IN NEW BRAUNFELS TEXAS AND TODAY I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO INSTALL A BASEBOARD
G5F-bwIsbFI_2 0 THIS IS YOUR TYPICAL PIECE OF BASEBOARD RIGHT HERE
G5F-bwIsbFI_3 0 AND BASICALLY WHAT YOU WOULD NEED TO DO IS YOU NEED TO MEASURE THE WALL AREA THAT YOU NEED YOUR BASEBOARD
G5F-bwIsbFI_4 0 IF YOU'RE PUTTING BASEBOARD IN AN ENTIRE HOUSE YOU'LL MEASURE THE WALL AREA FROM CORNER TO DOOR AND OR CORNER TO CORNER AND YOU'LL ADD UP ALL YOUR WALL AREA AND THEN YOU'LL WANT TO ADD TEN PERCENT FOR THE WASTE
G5F-bwIsbFI_5 0 NOW WHAT YOU'LL DO ONCE YOU GET YOUR BASEBOARD IN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PIECES ARE STRAIGHT AND NOT WARPED AND YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO BE SWOLLEN CROOKED ANYTHING LIKE THAT
G5F-bwIsbFI_6 0 YOU WANT THEM TO BE AS STRAIGHT AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY GET THEM
G5F-bwIsbFI_7 0 TYPICALLY YOU CAN GET PRE-PRIMED PIECES LIKE THIS OR YOU CAN GET THE BARE WOOD PIECES
G5F-bwIsbFI_8 0 I PREFER TO USE PRE-PRIMED JUST BECAUSE IT SAVES YOU A STEP WHEN YOU'RE READY TO PAINT
G5F-bwIsbFI_9 0 SO THE FIRST THING YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO MEASURE THE WALL THAT YOU WANT YOUR BASEBOARD ON
G5F-bwIsbFI_10 0 YOU SHOULD ALREADY HAVE YOUR CASING AROUND ALL THE DOORS AND ALL THE WINDOWS AND WHAT YOU'LL DO IS YOU'LL MEASURE FROM THE CORNER OF THE ROOM TO THE OTHER CORNER OR FROM THE CORNER TO THE CASING ON THE DOOR
G5F-bwIsbFI_11 0 AND ONCE YOU GET THAT MEASUREMENT YOU'LL WANT TO MEASURE IT ON YOUR PIECE OF BASEBOARD LIKE THIS AND THEN YOU'LL PUT A MARK
G5F-bwIsbFI_12 0 YOU'LL WANT TO CUT THAT PIECE AT THAT MARK AND THE PIECE IF IT'S AGAINST A PIECE OF CASING IT WOULD BE A SQUARE CUT
G5F-bwIsbFI_13 0 JUST A STRAIGHT CUT STRAIGHT ACROSS AND IT WOULD BUTT RIGHT UP TO THE CASING
G5F-bwIsbFI_14 0 BUT IF YOU'RE ON AN INSIDE CORNER YOU'LL HAVE TO MITER THE EDGE OF IT LIKE THIS
G5F-bwIsbFI_15 0 YOU'LL HAVE TO ANGLE A MITER IN THAT WAY THE OTHER PIECE CAN BE MITERED AND MATCH UP IN THAT CORNER
G5F-bwIsbFI_16 0 IF IT'S ON AN OUTSIDE CORNER YOU'LL HAVE TO MITER IT OUT LIKE THIS
G5F-bwIsbFI_17 0 THAT WAY AS IT COMES AROUND THE WALL WHEN YOU MITER THE OTHER ONE AT THAT SAME FORTY-FIVE DEGREE ANGLE THEY'LL MEET UP HERE AND GIVE YOU A NICE EDGE
G5F-bwIsbFI_18 0 ONCE YOU PUT YOUR BASEBOARD UP YOU CAN PROBABLY NAIL IT
G5F-bwIsbFI_19 0 YOU'LL WANT TO USE AN EIGHTEEN GAGE NAIL SIXTEEN GAGE NAIL SOMETHING THAT'S FAIRLY SMALL
G5F-bwIsbFI_20 0 THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE A BIG HOLE IN YOUR BASEBOARD
G5F-bwIsbFI_21 0 ALSO YOU NEED TO KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO PUT SHOE MOLDING ON YOU ATTACH THE SHOE MOLDING TO THE BASEBOARD NOT TO THE FLOOR
G5F-bwIsbFI_22 0 MY NAME'S RYAN PARKER PARKER HOME RENOVATIONS AND YOU CAN CONTACT ME AT PARKERHOMERENOVATIONS.COM
HGblCWBdQeA_1 0 IN THIS CLIP THERE'S JUST GENERAL THINGS THAT COULD POSE A PROBLEM TO YOU WHILE YOU'RE OUT THERE PADDLING
HGblCWBdQeA_2 0 FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES YOU'RE GOING TO GET UP PADDLING YOU'RE GOING TO FIND YOURSELF ACTUALLY DINGING THE SIDE OF THE BOARD WITH THE PADDLE
HGblCWBdQeA_3 0 IT'S VERY EASY FOR THIS PADDLE TO RUB AGAINST THE GUNNELS OF THE BOARD I GUESS YOU WOULD CALL IT IN BOATSMEN'S TERM
HGblCWBdQeA_4 0 BUT RATHER THAN DOING THAT THE FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES MAKE SURE YOU DO AN EXTRA WIDE PADDLE TO GET INTO THE GROOVE OF IT
HGblCWBdQeA_5 0 YOU CAN SEE WE ACTUALLY DO A LOT OF STAND UP PADDLE TOURS AND SORT OF GUIDED EXECUTIVE TRIPS AND A LOT OF THE GUYS ARE TAKING THESE PADDLES OUT AND THEY'RE RUBBING THEM RIGHT UP AGAINST THE GUNNELS SO YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A LITTLE MORE WEAR AND TEAR THAN THERE SHOULD BE THERE
HGblCWBdQeA_6 0 SO JUST GENERALLY SPEAKING TO WATCH OUT FOR YOUR EQUIPMENT AND OTHER PEOPLE'S ESPECIALLY
HGblCWBdQeA_7 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOU LIKE HAVE AN EXTRA WIDE PADDLE AND YOU'RE REALLY JUST TAKING BABY STEPS UP TO THE FINAL PROGRESSION
gNXh0ajoI1A_1 0 SO WHAT TO EAT BEFORE RUNNING A MARATHON
gNXh0ajoI1A_2 0 THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE OUT THERE FOR 26.2 MILES AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE PROPER NUTRITION FOR RUNNING SUCH A LONG DISTANCE
gNXh0ajoI1A_3 0 SO THERE'S A PROCESS THAT'S CALLED CARBO-LOADING AND A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE MARATHON YOU REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON EATING MOSTLY FOODS THAT ARE HIGH IN CARBOHYDRATES
gNXh0ajoI1A_4 0 SO THE CARBOHYDRATES TURN INTO WHAT IS CALLED GLUCOSE
gNXh0ajoI1A_5 0 GLUCOSE IS A KIND OF SUGAR THAT GIVES YOU THE ENERGY THAT YOU WILL NEED TO HELP SUSTAIN YOU OVER A 26 MILE RACE
gNXh0ajoI1A_6 0 BUT IN ADDITION TO SAY CARBO-LOADING SAY TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE THE ACTUAL MARATHON YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE GETTING ENOUGH LIQUIDS IN THAT YOU'RE HYDRATING WELL
gNXh0ajoI1A_7 0 SO IF YOU'RE RUNNING A MARATHON WHERE YOU KNOW THAT WEATHER'S GOING TO BE VERY VERY HOT IT'S GOING TO BE VERY VERY HUMID YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE WELL HYDRATED NOT ONLY WITH WATER BUT ALSO SOME KIND OF ELECTROLYTE DRINK
gNXh0ajoI1A_8 0 AND THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF ENERGY DRINKS THAT ARE ON THE MARKET TODAY
gNXh0ajoI1A_9 0 AND EVEN DURING THE MARATHON AT THE VOLUNTEER AID STATIONS ALONG THE COURSE THERE ARE VOLUNTEERS OUT THERE WHO ARE GIVING THE RUNNERS THESE TYPES OF ELECTROLYTE DRINKS WHICH HELP GET THEM THROUGH THE MARATHON
gNXh0ajoI1A_10 0 SO THE MORNING OF YOUR MARATHON YOU'RE EXCITED YOU'RE READY TO GO YOU'RE READY TO RUN BUT YOU'RE WONDERING SHOULD YOU EAT SOMETHING
gNXh0ajoI1A_11 0 SO IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT I'VE CARBOHYDRATED WITH RICH CARBOHYDRATES OF PASTA POTATOES TWO DAYS BEFORE AND THE MORNING OF THE MARATHON I USUALLY EAT MAYBE LIKE A POWER BAR A BANANA OR BAGEL GET IN SOME MORE LIQUIDS
gNXh0ajoI1A_12 0 I DON'T NORMALLY EAT LIKE A LARGE BREAKFAST BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO PERSONALLY BENEFIT ME BUT FOR SOME OTHER RUNNERS THEY MAY FEEL THEY HAVE TO EAT A BREAKFAST WITH FOOD FOOD WITH A BIT MORE SUBSTANCE MAYBE AN OATMEAL BREAKFAST OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
gNXh0ajoI1A_13 0 BUT I FIND FROM MY EXPERIENCE THAT MAYBE A BANANA OR POWER BAR ALONG WITH SOME EXTRA WATER OR ELECTROLYTE DRINKS TEND TO GET ME READY FOR FOR MY MARATHON DISTANCE
gNXh0ajoI1A_14 0 AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON WHO THE INDIVIDUAL IS IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH YOU EAT THE MORNING OF THE MARATHON
gz4XJ835ymg_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE THIS IS DAN KELLY WITH KELLER WILLIAMS REALTY HERE IN MIAMI SHORES FLORIDA
gz4XJ835ymg_2 0 I'M WITH THE KELLY WHITE TEAM AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TELL YOU HOW TO BUY A HOUSE
gz4XJ835ymg_3 0 OKAY WHEN YOU START YOUR SEARCH FOR YOUR HOME YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF THESE SIGNS IN THE FRONT YARD THAT SAY FOR SALE BY OWNER
gz4XJ835ymg_4 0 NOW AS A REALTOR THAT MAKES ME GO AHH
gz4XJ835ymg_5 0 BUT THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT THEM
gz4XJ835ymg_6 0 FOR SALE BY OWNER SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET A DEAL BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE SELLERS ACTUALLY UNDER PRICE THEIR HOMES SO SOME OF THE THINGS TO LOOK FOR WITH THE FOR SALE BY OWNER IS GO AHEAD AND CALL MAKE AN APPOINTMENT
gz4XJ835ymg_7 0 USUALLY BRING SOMEONE WITH YOU FOR THE APPOINTMENT JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE
gz4XJ835ymg_8 0 IF YOU GET DOWN TO THE NEGOTIATION AND CONTRACTS ALWAYS HIRE A REAL ESTATE LAWYER
gz4XJ835ymg_9 0 IT'S GOING TO COST YOU AROUND $500 BUT TRUST ME THAT IS GOING TO BE $500 WELL SPENT
gz4XJ835ymg_10 0 HE'LL GUIDE YOU THROUGH ALL THE PITFALLS OF THE CONTRACT TO MAKE SURE HE'S PROTECTING YOUR SIDE
gz4XJ835ymg_11 0 ALSO WHEN YOU PUT A DEPOSIT NEVER GIVE THE DEPOSIT DIRECTLY TO THE OWNER
gz4XJ835ymg_12 0 MAKE SURE THAT'S HELD IN ESCROW AT THE TITLE COMPANY OR WITH THE LAWYER
GP8PBhO7sHY_1 0 HOW MANY TIMES A DAY DO YOU THINK TO STRETCH YOUR TOES
GP8PBhO7sHY_3 0 I'M CINDY MASTRY
GP8PBhO7sHY_4 0 WE SPEND A LOT OF TIMES STRETCHING ALL THE OTHER PARTS OF THE BODIES BUT WE FORGET ABOUT OUR FEET
GP8PBhO7sHY_5 0 AND OUR FEET ARE THE VERY FOUNDATION THE VERY GROUNDING TO THE EARTH
GP8PBhO7sHY_6 0 WHAT HAPPENS IS BLOOD GETS PULLED DOWN INTO OUR FEET AND TOES AND IT GETS STUCK THERE AND IT GETS STAGNANT
GP8PBhO7sHY_7 0 SO A REALLY GOOD WAY TO STRETCH YOUR TOES AND FLUSH ALL THE STAGNANT BLOOD OUT OF YOUR TOES IS TO USE HERO POSE BUT TO SIT ON YOUR TOES
GP8PBhO7sHY_8 0 SO I'M GOING TO COME OVER UNDER MY KNEES AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO SPREAD MY TOES AS WIDE AS I CAN AND JUST SIT BACK ON MY HEELS ADDING A LITTLE PRESSURE
GP8PBhO7sHY_9 0 IF YOU'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE THIS IS GOING TO FEEL PRETTY INTENSE
GP8PBhO7sHY_10 0 SO YOU MIGHT NEED TO JUST START OUT WITH JUST A FEW SECONDS AND THEN THE NEXT DAY DO A FEW MORE SECONDS
GP8PBhO7sHY_11 0 BUT WHAT THIS IS DOING YOU'RE SPREADING YOUR TOES GETTING THOSE MUSCLES TO START BEING ACTIVATED AGAIN BECAUSE THEY LOSE THEIR THEIR ABILITY TO MOVE WHEN WE CRAMMED THEM INTO SHOES AND FLUSHING ALL THAT STAGNANT BLOOD OUT OF THE TOES THAT PUSHES IT RIGHT BACK UP INTO YOUR LEGS
GP8PBhO7sHY_12 0 SO THIS IS A REALLY GREAT WAY TO STRETCH YOUR TOES WHILE YOU'RE IN HERO POSE
hG8kZXxcNRk_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO START TALKING NOW ABOUT CASE STYLES
hG8kZXxcNRk_2 0 YOU'VE SEEN MANY OF THOSE STYLES AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE COMPANIES AND THE HISTORY OF THE CONNECTICUT CLOCK INDUSTRY
hG8kZXxcNRk_3 0 NOW LET'S FOCUS ON THE CASE STYLES NOW SO THAT YOU KNOW BETTER OF WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE LOOKING FOR ANTIQUE CLOCKS
hG8kZXxcNRk_4 0 WE'LL START WITH STEEPLE CLOCKS
hG8kZXxcNRk_5 0 THIS IS LIKE THE BANJO CLOCK
hG8kZXxcNRk_6 0 STEEPLE CLOCK NAME CAME LATER ON THEY WEREN'T ORIGINALLY CALLED THAT
hG8kZXxcNRk_7 0 THE DESIGNERS OF THEM THE EARLY SELLER'S OF THEM CALLED THEM SHARP GOTHICS
hG8kZXxcNRk_8 0 THERE WAS A RESURGENCE OF INTERESTED INTEREST IN GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE GOTHIC DESIGN AT THE TIME
hG8kZXxcNRk_9 0 SO THIS IS A GOTHIC STYLE PERHAPS REMINDS YOU OF A CHURCH OR A CATHEDRAL SO THE NAME STEEPLE CLOCK PERHAPS ARRIVED FAIRLY SOON AFTERWARDS
hG8kZXxcNRk_10 0 BUT IT'S AN ICONIC AMERICAN STYLE OF CLOCK AND THE CONSTRUCTION WAS PRETTY SIMILAR
hG8kZXxcNRk_11 0 THE THING TO NOTICE IS THE THE EARLIEST ONES HAD CONICAL CONICAL FINIALS
hG8kZXxcNRk_12 0 THESE ARE CALLED FINIALS AND THE EARLIEST ONES ARE JUST THESE TURNED CONES
hG8kZXxcNRk_13 0 LATER ON THEY BEGAN BEING LATHED TURNED LIKE THIS THE MORE COMPLICATED DESIGN
hG8kZXxcNRk_14 0 SO IF YOU'RE TRYING TO QUICKLY DATE A STEEPLE CLOCK YOU HAVE MIGHT HAVE A SENSE SOON THAT IT'S AN EARLIER ONE IF IT HAS CONICAL FINIALS RATHER THAN TURNED
hG8kZXxcNRk_15 0 VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEM HAVE ARE VENEERED AND THESE CURVES AND OFTEN WITH MAHOGANY OR ROSEWOOD USUALLY ON A PINE BASE
hG8kZXxcNRk_16 0 OFTEN IT HAS THESE STEEPLE CLOCKS HAVE VENEER PROBLEMS
hG8kZXxcNRk_17 0 YOU CAN SEE IN A CASE LIKE THIS WHERE ON AN EDGE IT'S PRETTY EASY FOR YOUR DUST CLOTH TO CATCH AN EDGE OF VENEER IF IT'S STARTING TO LIFT AND POP OFF
hG8kZXxcNRk_18 0 AND THEN YOU HAVE A PRETTY GOOD PROJECT FOR A GOOD WOOD WORKER TO DO CURVED VENEER REPLACEMENT AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS
hG8kZXxcNRk_19 0 SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR FOR STEEPLE CLOCKS YOU WANT TO SEE ONES THAT DON'T HAVE A LOT OF VENEER PROBLEMS
hG8kZXxcNRk_20 0 YOU CAN SEE UP TOP HERE TOO WE HAVE ANOTHER PLACE WHERE THE VENEER HAS COME UP
hG8kZXxcNRk_21 0 BUT WHEN THE VENEER IS THERE AND THEY'RE SHINED UP THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL CLOCKS BECAUSE OF THE MATCHING GRAIN AND THE QUALITY OF THE WOOD VENEER TO BEGIN WITH
hG8kZXxcNRk_22 0 OCCASIONALLY YOU SEE WHERE SOMEONE'S CHEATED THE VENEER HAS STARTED TO COME OFF
hG8kZXxcNRk_23 0 THEY JUST TAKE THE REST OF THE VENEER OFF STAIN UP THE CASE AND YOU HAVE BASICALLY A PINE STEEPLE CLOCK WHICH MAY LOOK PRETTY BUT DEFINITELY IS NOT DESIRABLE
gpwcPkXIo4c_1 0 DEPENDING ON YOUR MICROWAVE IT MIGHT TAKE LONGER THIS LOOKS GOOD YOU CAN SEE THE CARAMEL IS ALL BROKEN DOWN THE CREAM IS ON TOP LETS MIX IT AND IT WILL FEEL A LITTLE TOUGH AT FIRST AGAIN THIS IS VERY HOT SO YOU WANT TO START OFF MIXING SLOW IF YOU GO IN THERE AND WHIP CRAZY YOU MIGHT SCOLD YOURSELF WITH SOME HOT CREAM
gpwcPkXIo4c_2 0 JUST TAKE IT EASY MIX IT AROUND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH THE CARAMEL WE'RE GOING TO INCORPORATE 2/3 OF THIS WITH THREE CUPS OF THE CHEESECAKE FILING
gpwcPkXIo4c_3 0 AND WE WILL MARBLE IT INTO THE CHEESECAKE PHASE WE'LL RESERVE 1/3 OF THE CARAMEL MIX FOR ACTUALLY TOPPING THE CAKE AND WE'LL BE DOING THAT A LITTLE LATER
gpwcPkXIo4c_4 0 OKAY THE CARAMEL IS LOOKING GOOD IT'S NOT TO RUNNY IT'S ABOUT A MEDIUM CONSISTENCY HERE LIKE A MEDIUM SAUCE YOU DON'T WANT IT ANY THINNER IF IT'S THICKER IT WILL LUMP UP IN THE CHEESECAKE BETTER
gpwcPkXIo4c_5 0 SO WE HAVE THIS WE HAVE IT OFF THE SIDES OFF THE BOTTOM EVERY THING'S MIXED NICELY

HajaLr2bVj0_12 0 NOTICE AS WE MOVE THAT WE ARE MAINTAINING GOOD FOOTWORK THAT AT ALL TIMES OUR LEGS ARE UNDERNEATH US AND WE'RE GOING PRETTY DIAGONAL AND PERPENDICULAR AND IN STRAIGHT LINES BUT AS YOU DO THE DRILL IN CLASS YOU ARE MOVING YOU'RE PROBING THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO START ANY CLASS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT IS BLACK BELT OR WHITE BELT BECAUSE YOU WANT YOUR STUDENTS TO REALLY GET THEIR LEGS WARMED UP GETTING THEIR MINDS SET GETTING THAT SENSE OF DISTANCE AND ALIGNMENT SO THAT IT BECOMES INSTINCTIVE TO THEM

hHmiHmjY74g_1 0 ONE OF THE THINGS YOU WANT TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY OUT THERE HIKING ESPECIALLY ON A DAY HIKE OR A MULTI-DAY HIKE IS THE CARE OF YOUR FEET
hHmiHmjY74g_2 0 THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO CONSIDER IS WHAT TYPE OF SOCK YOU'RE GOING TO WEAR
hHmiHmjY74g_3 0 SOCKS ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE MOST OFTEN NEGLECTED
hHmiHmjY74g_4 0 THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOCKS THAT WE RECOMMEND AT BILL JACKSON'S ONE OF WHICH IS A SYNTHETIC SOCK THE OTHER BEING A WOOL SOCK
hHmiHmjY74g_5 0 WOOL GETS A BAD RAP
hHmiHmjY74g_6 0 MOST PEOPLE THINK WOOL IS ONLY TO KEEP YOUR FOOT WARM BUT IF YOU CONSIDER THE FACT THAT MOST MEN'S TROPICAL WEIGHT BUSINESS SUITS ARE MADE OUT OF WOOL YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WOOL IS ACTUALLY A COOLING AND A WARMING FABRIC
hHmiHmjY74g_7 0 THE NICE THING ABOUT WOOL IS THAT IT IS A NATURALLY AN ANTIBACTERIAL
hHmiHmjY74g_8 0 IN OTHER WORDS BACTERIA WILL NOT GROW IN A WOOL SOCK AND SO IF YOU'RE OUT FOR MORE THAN ONE DAY YOU CAN WEAR YOUR WOOL SOCKS OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITHIN REASON OF COURSE
hHmiHmjY74g_9 0 SO IT REALLY HELPS YOUR FOOT STAY DRY AND THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
hHmiHmjY74g_10 0 SYNTHETIC SOCKS WHICH WE HAVE HERE THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT SYNTHETIC FIBERS
hHmiHmjY74g_11 0 THE ONE THAT WE ARE DEMONSTRATING HERE TODAY IS MADE WITH COOLMAX
hHmiHmjY74g_12 0 COOLMAX IS ACTUALLY A CROSS-SHAPED POLYESTER FIBER
hHmiHmjY74g_13 0 THE CROSS-SHAPE CHANNELS THE PERSPIRATION FROM YOUR FOOT RIGHT OUT OF THE SOCK AND INTO THE OUTER LAYER OF YOUR SHOE
hHmiHmjY74g_14 0 IF YOU'RE WEARING A WORKOUT SHOE THEN THAT TAKES ALL THAT AWAY AND HELPS YOUR FOOT STAY DRY AND COMFORTABLE AND PREVENTS BLISTERS
gx6YmcpPRXw_1 0 HI MY NAME IS CHARLES CHALLY AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU HOW TO PLAY KLONDIKE SOLITAIRE
gx6YmcpPRXw_2 0 THIS IS THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF SOLITAIRE AND ANYBODY WHO'S PLAYED SOLITAIRE ON THEIR MICROSOFT COMPUTER HAS PROBABLY KNOWN THIS ONE
gx6YmcpPRXw_3 0 ANYWAY YOU START OFF WITH A REGULAR DECK OF CARDS WHICH USUALLY YOU SHUFFLE
gx6YmcpPRXw_4 0 PLACE ONE CARD FACE UP AND THEN SIX CARDS FACE DOWN
gx6YmcpPRXw_5 0 FACE UP AND THEN THE REST FACE DOWN
gx6YmcpPRXw_6 0 SO FACE DOWN
gx6YmcpPRXw_7 0 SO ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS THE MOST COMMON WAY THAT PEOPLE PLAY IS TO TAKE THREE CARDS AT A TIME AND FLIP THEM OVER
gx6YmcpPRXw_8 0 NOW THE POINT IS TO GET ALL THE CARDS UP AT THE TOP BUT IN ORDER TO GET THEM AT THE TOP YOU NEED TO HAVE AN ACE
gx6YmcpPRXw_9 0 OTHER THEN THAT THE ONLY OTHER RULE IS THAT YOU CAN STACK CARDS IF IT IS THE OPPOSITE SUITE
gx6YmcpPRXw_10 0 OR THE OPPOSITE COLOR
gx6YmcpPRXw_11 0 SO FOR EXAMPLE BLACK JACK ON RED QUEEN
gx6YmcpPRXw_12 0 THEN YOU CAN FLIP UP THE CARD UNDERNEATH
gx6YmcpPRXw_13 0 I'VE GOT A CHOICE HERE BETWEEN TWO TENS
gx6YmcpPRXw_14 0 I LIKE TO TAKE THE PILE THAT HAS THE FEWEST NUMBER OF CARDS BECAUSE IT GIVES ME SOME MORE FLEXIBILITY LATER ON
gx6YmcpPRXw_15 0 BUT THAT AGAIN IS A PERSONAL CHOICE
gx6YmcpPRXw_16 0 YOU JUST KEEP FLIPPING
gx6YmcpPRXw_17 0 USUALLY YOU ARE ALLOWED TO GO THROUGH THIS DECK AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT TO
gx6YmcpPRXw_18 0 HOWEVER ORIGINALLY WHEN THIS GAME WAS PLAYED FOR MONEY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE ONLY THREE CHANCES TO GO THROUGH THE DECK
gx6YmcpPRXw_19 0 THE IDEA WAS THAT YOU PAID FIFTY TWO DOLLARS FOR THE DECK AND FOR EVERY CARD YOU GOT UP YOU GOT FIVE DOLLARS BACK
gx6YmcpPRXw_20 0 PEOPLE USUALLY DIDN'T GET THEIR MONEY BACK
gx6YmcpPRXw_21 0 THIS IS GOING TO BE A SHORT GAME
gx6YmcpPRXw_22 0 ANYWAY WIN OR LOSE THAT'S HOW YOU PLAY SOLITAIRE
GcI3vChH4Ow_1 0 AMANDA CLAIRE SO I'M DONE WITH ALL MY REALLY FINE BRUSH WORK AND I KINDA WANT TO GET AWAY FROM THIS BRUSH AS QUICK AS I CAN BECAUSE IT TAKES FOREVER TO GET COVERAGE WITH IT
GcI3vChH4Ow_2 0 BUT I GOT ALL MY DETAILS DONE
GcI3vChH4Ow_3 0 AND BEFORE I MOVE ON TO MY NEXT BRUSH I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO CLEAN MY BRUSH OUT WITH WATER BECAUSE THE KIND OF GLUE WE'RE USING LIKE MOD PODGE OR ANY SIMILAR GLUE THAT'S WATER BASED BUT WHEN IT'S DRIED IT BASICALLY TURNS INTO KIND OF LIKE A PLASTIC AND IT WON'T DISSOLVE AGAIN
GcI3vChH4Ow_4 0 SO IF YOU DON'T CLEAN YOUR BRUSHES AND YOU JUST KINDA SET IT ASIDE AND IF IT DRIES ON THERE THEN YOU COULD BASICALLY THROW THAT BRUSH AWAY BECAUSE IT'S NOT COMING OUT
GcI3vChH4Ow_6 0 SO I'VE GOT MY BRUSH SO NOW I'M GOING TO SWITCH TO MY MEDIUM BRUSH AND JUST SAME THING
GcI3vChH4Ow_7 0 I MEAN IT'S KIND OF YOU KNOW IT'S A DRY BRISTLE BRUSH
GcI3vChH4Ow_8 0 I'M GOING TO KIND OF JUST I'M JUST KIND OF MASSAGING THE HEAD OF THE BRUSH HERE TO JUST IF THERE'S ANY LOOSE BRISTLES KIND OF PULL THEM OUT
GcI3vChH4Ow_9 0 AND I'M JUST GOING TO NOW KEEP GOING WITH THE GLUE
GcI3vChH4Ow_10 0 AGAIN NOT PUTTING IT ON TOO THICK BUT NOW THAT I'VE KINDA GOT THE FINE DETAILS JUST KIND OF START FILLING IN BETWEEN THEM AND JUST TRY AND GET AS MUCH COVERAGE AS I CAN WHILE NOT MESSING UP THE DETAIL I'VE ALREADY DONE
GcI3vChH4Ow_11 0 SO I'LL WORK AT THE MEDIUM BRUSH FOR A WHILE KIND OF FINISH OUT THESE AREAS HERE MAYBE MAKE TRACE IT ONE TIME
GcI3vChH4Ow_12 0 YOU JUST KINDA GET A LITTLE BIT FURTHER AWAY FROM THE IMAGE
GcI3vChH4Ow_13 0 AND THE LAST THING I'LL DO ONCE I DO THAT IS MOVE TO A LARGE BRUSH AND FILL IN ALL THIS BIG AREA THERE
GuPfrbCfXvk_1 0 NOW THAT I HAVE MY CHORDS LAID DOWN OVER IT
GuPfrbCfXvk_2 0 IT SOUNDS GOOD JUST THE WAY IT IS BUT I AM GOING TO QUANTIZES IT JUST TO GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT OF A TIGHTER FEEL
GuPfrbCfXvk_3 0 SO WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS HIGH LIGHT I AM TO UNARM MY RECORDED TRACK
GuPfrbCfXvk_4 0 RIGHT AND I AM GOING TO HIGH LIGHT THE TRACK I JUST RECORDED THE PIANO
GuPfrbCfXvk_5 0 WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS CAPTURE THE SELECTION AND ANALYZE IT
GuPfrbCfXvk_6 0 ONCE I HAVE IT WERE I WANT TO CUT IT I AM GOING TO CUT IT BEFORE EACH CORD THAT S THE FIRST CORD SECOND THIRD FORTH AND I AM GOING TO SEPARATE IT
GuPfrbCfXvk_7 0 THE NEXT THING THAT I AM GOING TO DO IS CONFORM IT
GuPfrbCfXvk_8 0 CAPTURE THE SELECTION AGAIN AND CONFORM IT
GuPfrbCfXvk_9 0 I T SEAMS LIKE A COUPLE OF THEM ARE A LITTLE BUT OFF SO WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS I AM JUST GOING TO USE MY GRID AND JUST MOVE IT MANUALLY TO WHERE IT SHOULD BE
GuPfrbCfXvk_10 0 AND CONFORM IT ONE MORE TIME
GuPfrbCfXvk_11 0 SO NOW WHEN I PLAY IT SHOULD BE ON POINT
geNdFCdRmdc_1 0 NOW IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT I CALL MY FINGER SLIDING
geNdFCdRmdc_2 0 AND IT'S A REALLY REALLY SIMPLE IDEA AND IT'S VERY BASIC AND IT'S BASED OFF THE IDEA OF MODULATING OR CHANGING KEY
geNdFCdRmdc_3 0 NOW AS YOU'RE PLAYING ALONG YOU MIGHT DO A LITTLE FEEL OR SOMETHING ON THE KEY THAT YOU REALLY LIKE KEYBOARD THAT YOU LIKED OR THE ORGAN AND LIKE OH MAN HOW DO I- I WANT TO PLAY IT ON ANOTHER KEY

geNdFCdRmdc_5 0 WELL IF YOU'RE USE TO PLAYING ON ONE KEY WELL HOW CAN I DO THIS ONE THING THAT I FOUND
geNdFCdRmdc_6 0 YOU CAN ONE NOTE AT A TIME CHANGE IT UP TO THE VERY NEXT KEY
geNdFCdRmdc_7 0 LETS SAY THAT I WERE ON AN E FLAT LETS SAY I WERE ON E FLAT OR IN OTHER WORDS E FLAT IS BASED OFF OF FINDING E WE KNOW WHERE D IS NOW WHERE THE DOG FACE IS D IN ALPHABETICAL IS RIGHT AFTER E I'M SORRY E COMES RIGHT AFTER D SO HERE WE ARE AND I'M GOING TO GO TO E FLAT
geNdFCdRmdc_8 0 FLAT IS THE VERY HALF STEP BELOW IT
geNdFCdRmdc_9 0 SO LETS SAY WE'RE AT E FLAT AND I FIND THIS SOMETHING LIKE THAT LIKE THAT OH WELL THAT SOUNDS GOOD THERE I WANT TO DO IT IN THE NEXT KEY
geNdFCdRmdc_10 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR TIME YOU'RE PLAYING BY EAR HERE YOU'RE BEING CREATIVE WITH IT YOU'RE FINDING YOUR OWN WAY WITHOUT READING THE MUSIC OR ANYTHING
geNdFCdRmdc_11 0 YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE EACH NOTE ONE BY ONE I WANT TO GO FROM E FLAT TO E
H2UbBPFSinc_1 0 HI IT'S COACH RUDY HERE I'VE WON A COUPLE OF CHAMPIONSHIPS AS A PLAYER AND A COACH

H2UbBPFSinc_3 0 ONCE IN A WHILE WE WANT TO HAVE SOME FUN AT PRACTICE
H2UbBPFSinc_4 0 ALRIGHT HERE'S A DRILL YOU CAN RUN
H2UbBPFSinc_5 0 IT'S CALLED THE ULTIMATE FAST BREAK DRILL OR SOME PEOPLE CALL IT THE TWELVE MAN FAST BREAK DRILL BECAUSE IT'S CONTINUOUS IT GOES ON FOREVER AND THERE'S PEOPLE IN THE COURT
H2UbBPFSinc_6 0 LET ME WALK YOU THROUGH HOW IT WORKS
H2UbBPFSinc_7 0 ALRIGHT THESE THREE GUYS BRING THE BALL DOWN AS SOON AS THEY BRING THE BALL DOWN THE FIRST TWO GUYS OFF THE SIDE LINE COME IN AND ESTABLISH THEIR DEFENSIVE POSITION
H2UbBPFSinc_8 0 THESE GUYS ATTACK THESE TWO GUYS ALRIGHT
H2UbBPFSinc_9 0 THESE GUYS EITHER MAKE THE SHOT OR THEY MISS THE SHOT
H2UbBPFSinc_10 0 THEY MISS THE SHOT THESE TWO GUYS ARE FLYING OUT GOING THE OTHER WAY AND THE FIRST GUY ON THIS SIDE COMES IN TO JOIN THEM
H2UbBPFSinc_11 0 SO NOW IT'S THE THREE GUYS FROM THE OTHER END AGAINST THESE TWO GUYS
H2UbBPFSinc_13 0 WHEN THAT HAPPENS THESE TWO GUYS COME IN AND ESTABLISH THEIR DEFENSIVE POSITIONS
H2UbBPFSinc_14 0 THESE THREE GUYS ATTACK EITHER MAKE THE SHOT OR MISS THE SHOT
H2UbBPFSinc_15 0 IF THEY MAKE THE SHOT SO THEN THESE TWO DEFENSIVE PLAYERS COME DOWN TO PLAY OFFENSE AND THE VERY NEXT GUY IN LINE COMES DOWN TO JOIN THEM TO PLAY THREE ON TWO AGAINST THESE GUYS
H2UbBPFSinc_17 0 AS SOON AS THESE GUYS GO OUT THIS GUY JOINS THEM SO THEN IT'S THREE ON TWO THESE GUYS GET THE BALL THEY BRING IT DOWN AND THEN IT'S THREE ON TWO IT GOES BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH
H2UbBPFSinc_18 0 IT GOES ON FOR HOURS IT'S A GREAT DRILL YOU DEVELOP A LOT OF BALL HANDLING SKILLS
H2UbBPFSinc_19 0 WORK ON A LOT OF LAY UPS SOME GOOD DEFENSIVE STUFF I CERTAINLY RECOMMEND THE ULTIMATE FAST BREAK DRILL IF YOU ARE JUST STARTING TO DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR TEAM OR IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE SEASON AND YOU NEED SOME ENERGY
H2UbBPFSinc_20 0 IT'S A GOOD DRILL LEARN IT RUN IT
h3NueTMOkoI_2 0 MY NAME'S REBBECA HERRICK
h3NueTMOkoI_3 0 I'M HERE AT EVERYTHING PEACEFUL IN WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA TO SHOW YOU THE SUPPLIES OF HOT STONE MASSAGE
h3NueTMOkoI_4 0 THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT YOU DEFINITELY NEED
h3NueTMOkoI_5 0 FIRST OF ALL YOU NEED A WARMER
h3NueTMOkoI_6 0 AN OVEN ROASTER OR THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT VARIATIONS YOU CAN USE FOR THAT
h3NueTMOkoI_7 0 BASICALLY THE POINT OF THIS IS TO HEAT THE WATER TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT
h3NueTMOkoI_8 0 THE NEXT THING YOU NEED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE STONES IS A LIGHT COLORED TOWEL FOR THE BASE
h3NueTMOkoI_9 0 SO FIRST YOU PUT THE TOWEL IN
h3NueTMOkoI_10 0 AND THEN YOU WOULD PLACE YOUR STONES IN
h3NueTMOkoI_11 0 YOU CAN USE STONES OF VARIOUS SIZES SHAPES
h3NueTMOkoI_12 0 BASALT THESE BLACK STONES HERE
h3NueTMOkoI_13 0 VOLCANIC STONE FROM HAWAII ARE OFTEN USED BECAUSE OF THEIR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE TEMPERATURE AND HOLD THE HEAT
h3NueTMOkoI_14 0 AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT VERY POROUS SO THEY HAVE A GOOD SLIDE TO THEM
h3NueTMOkoI_15 0 YOU WILL ALWAYS WANT TO HAVE A SLOTTED SPOON AVAILABLE TO TAKE THE STONES OUT OF THE WATER WITH
h3NueTMOkoI_16 0 BECAUSE THE WATER IS HOT YOU DON'T WANT TO REACH IN THERE WITH YOUR HANDS
h3NueTMOkoI_17 0 AND YOU'LL ALSO PROBABLY WANT TO HAVE A COOL BOWL OF COOL WATER NEXT TO IT JUST IN CASE YOU WANT TO COOL THE STONES OFF MORE RAPIDLY
h3NueTMOkoI_18 0 YOU MIGHT ALSO WANT TO HAVE A COOL TOWEL ON HAND IN CASE YOU WANT TO COOL YOUR CLIENTS SKIN OFF
h3NueTMOkoI_19 0 AND THAT WOULD BE THE SUPPLIES YOU NEED FOR HOT STONE MASSAGE
gOGKEq4Gvt4_1 0 LAUREN FARRAHER MY NAME IS LAUREN AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT CURLY HAIR UPDOS THAT YOU CAN DO AT HOME
gOGKEq4Gvt4_2 0 WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING A CURLY STYLE ESPECIALLY IF YOUR HAIR IS STRAIGHT OR EVEN HAS A BIT OF A CURL WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON WHEN YOU'RE BLOWING YOUR HAIR OUT IS YOUR ACTUAL VOLUME OF YOUR HAIR
gOGKEq4Gvt4_3 0 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO FOCUS SO MUCH ABOUT GETTING YOUR ENDS STRAIGHT AND SMOOTH BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO BE GOING OVER IT WITH A CURLING IRON
gOGKEq4Gvt4_4 0 CURLING IRONS CAN ALMOST ACT AS A FLAT IRON WITH THE HEAT THAT IS GOING DOWN ON THE HAIR
gOGKEq4Gvt4_5 0 IF YOU GRAB A SECTION WHAT I SUGGEST YOU DO IS YOU UTILIZE THE FACT THAT IT IS A THERMAL INSTRUMENT
gOGKEq4Gvt4_6 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO BRING IT UP TO THE BASE OF THE HEAD BRING IT DOWN
gOGKEq4Gvt4_7 0 NOW THIS DUCK CLIP YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GO WITH THE GRAIN
gOGKEq4Gvt4_8 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO TURN WITH IT IN ORDER FOR IT TO GO DOWN
gOGKEq4Gvt4_9 0 THEN YOU'RE GOING TO ROLL IT UP
gOGKEq4Gvt4_10 0 THE HEAT OF THIS IS AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO GIVE YOU A BIT OF SMOOTHNESS
gOGKEq4Gvt4_11 0 EVEN WITH NO PRODUCT SHE'S STILL GETTING THE SMOOTHNESS
gOGKEq4Gvt4_12 0 NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE TEND TO GO THE OPPOSITE WAY AND THIS IS WHERE THEIR DOWNFALL IS
gOGKEq4Gvt4_13 0 THEY'RE PUTTING THE DUCK CLIP ON TOP AND THEN THEY'RE ROLLING AGAINST IT SO THE HAIR IS LIKE THAT
gOGKEq4Gvt4_14 0 WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET THEN IS A CRANK IN THE HAIR AND A LOT OF PEOPLE GO WRONG BY PUTTING THAT CRANK IN
gOGKEq4Gvt4_15 0 YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR CURL NATURAL SMOOTH
GSTw7LOhuhI_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO DO OUR BEST NOW TO PUT ALL OF THESE EFFORTS TOGETHER AND CREATE THE TEAM THAT CAN GO IN AND DO IT VERY QUICKLY
GSTw7LOhuhI_2 0 NOW GIVEN THAT THE COWS ARE A LITTLE BIT CLOSE TO THE HOLE THEY GIVE YOU PERMISSION I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS TIME TO DO WHAT WE CALL KIND OF PUSH THEM BACK
GSTw7LOhuhI_3 0 BECAUSE IF WE START OUT WITH THE COWS ALREADY THINKING ABOUT CUTTING ACROSS WE'RE GOING BE AT A GREAT DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY WILL THINK AND THEN THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE
GSTw7LOhuhI_4 0 SO WE'LL START OVER NOW AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO PUT TOGETHER THE KIND OF TEAMWORK THAT WOULD BRING US TO A VERY QUICK FINISH AND BE WITHIN THAT SIXTY SECONDS
GSTw7LOhuhI_5 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SAY FLAGS UP AND MY NUMBER IS ZERO
GSTw7LOhuhI_7 0 RED ON THE WALL
GSTw7LOhuhI_8 0 LET THREE WATCH THREE
GSTw7LOhuhI_9 0 THAT'S OK THAT'S THE PLACE WE WOULD STOP AND TALK ABOUT HOW THE ONE IN FRONT OF THE THREE FOR US RIGHT NOW WOULD'VE BEEN A FINE WAY TO PLAY IT
GSTw7LOhuhI_10 0 BUT WHEN THAT THREE GOT THROUGH THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT INGOING BUST
GSTw7LOhuhI_11 0 WE'RE GOING TO PUSH THEM BACK ACROSS AND WE'LL START OVER AGAIN AND HOPE THAT WE GET A GOOD ROUND
GUE6zOwZogY_1 0 ONE OF THE JUMP ROPES I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS THE GENERAL PLASTIC WE CALL THEM PLASTIC TYPE NYLON JUMP ROPE
GUE6zOwZogY_2 0 MOST OF THEM ARE EQUIPPED WITH A BALL BEARING TYPE SWIVEL AT THE VERY END SO THAT MAKES THEM A LITTLE BIT FASTER AND THE JUMP ROPE ITSELF DOESN'T GET BALLED UP INSIDE THE HANDLE
GUE6zOwZogY_3 0 THESE ARE ALSO ADJUSTABLE IF YOU DECIDE THAT A NINE FOOT ONE IS TOO LONG FOR YOUR AVERAGE BOXER MOST OF YOUR BOXERS
GUE6zOwZogY_4 0 YOU CAN ACTUALLY SHORTEN IT BY PASSING THE JUMP ROPE BACK THROUGH IT THROUGH THE HANDLE ITSELF AND THERE'S USUALLY A NET OR A WIRE COUPLING ON THERE THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY CUT AND THEN REATTACH SO YOU'LL GET A LITTLE BIT SHORTER JUMP ROPE
GUE6zOwZogY_5 0 ONCE YOU SHORTER A JUMP ROPE THAT'S AS SHORT AS IT'S GOING TO BE AND THERE'S NO WAY OF LENGTHENING THEM
GUE6zOwZogY_6 0 THE PLASTIC JUMP ROPE SOMETIMES IS A LITTLE BIT FAST FOR YOUR BEGINNERS
GUE6zOwZogY_7 0 YOU'LL SEE IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE BEGINNERS SOMETIMES THEY'LL COME IN AND THE JUMP ROPE WILL BE SO FAST THAT BY THE TIME THEY JUMP THEY'VE ALREADY PASSED IT BACK AROUND AGAIN AND THEY'RE HITTING THEMSELVES IN THE ANKLES THE SECOND TIME AROUND BEFORE THEY GET A CHANCE TO JUMP AGAIN
GUE6zOwZogY_8 0 SO KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR BEGINNERS AND TELL THEM RIGHT AWAY IF THE JUMP ROPE IS A LITTLE BIT FAST FOR THEM WE'LL GO WITH A LITTLE BIT SLOWER ROPE AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN JUST A MOMENT
goDO1vpM1ts_1 0 CHRIS MURPHY HI
goDO1vpM1ts_2 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE THIS IS CHRIS MURPHY
goDO1vpM1ts_3 0 I'M HERE AT THE NEW YORK COMEDY CLUB IN NEW YORK CITY
goDO1vpM1ts_4 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO HAVE A CAREER IN COMEDY
goDO1vpM1ts_6 0 THIS IS THE COMEDY CLASS VERY IMPORTANT
goDO1vpM1ts_7 0 I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES PEOPLE MAKE UNNECESSARY MISTAKES BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T GOT A GOOD COACH TO TEACH THEM SOMETHING
goDO1vpM1ts_8 0 NOW HAVING SAID THIS YOU CAN'T TEACH SOMEONE TO BE FUNNY
goDO1vpM1ts_9 0 THAT HAS TO BE BORN
goDO1vpM1ts_10 0 I BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE TO BE BORN WITH A FUNNY BONE BUT YOU CAN TEACH SOMEONE HOW TO MAKE THIS INTO A CRAFT
goDO1vpM1ts_12 0 NOW IN THE BEGINNING MANY COMICS MAKE A LOT OF MISTAKES ON AND OFF STAGE THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE MADE IF THEY HAD AN EXPERIENCED PERSON COACHING THEM THROUGH TELLING THEM HEY DON'T DO THAT
goDO1vpM1ts_14 0 MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND SO IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A GUY KINDA NOT JUDGE THEM BUT JUST TELL THEM EXACTLY STEP BY STEP HOW THEY CAN GET WORK AND MAKE THEIR ACT BETTER
goDO1vpM1ts_15 0 SO A COMEDY CLASS CAN BE VERY VALUABLE
goDO1vpM1ts_16 0 MOST IMPORTANT AFTER THE CLASS DO OPEN MICS IMMEDIATELY
goDO1vpM1ts_17 0 DO NOT LOSE MOMENTUM AFTER THE CLASS
GFyzZd2T2J4_1 0 HI I'M TINA STULL AND I DRIVE THE TOP DRAGSTER FOR INTERSTATE BATTERIES
GFyzZd2T2J4_2 0 ON BEHALF OF THE EXPERT VILLAGE I'M HERE TO HELP YOU WALK THROUGH THE PROCESS OF FILLING OUT THE FORM SO THAT YOU CAN COMPETE IN THE NHRA
GFyzZd2T2J4_3 0 WHEN IT COMES TIME TO REGISTER FOR THE EVENT HERE I'M CLICKING ON IT BUT IT TELLS ME THAT I'M NOT OPEN TO REGISTER AT THIS TIME I HAVE FOURTEEN DAYS BUT IF YOU CLICK ON IT ANYWAY IT WILL BRING UP THIS SCHEDULE

hD1odl4mEq4_1 0 SO WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT DIGITAL THERMOMETERS
hD1odl4mEq4_2 0 A DIGITAL THERMOMETER IS GOING TO COST YOU A BIT MORE HOWEVER THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT DIGITAL THERMOMETERS IS BASICALLY WHAT IT IS THIS IS GOING TO GO ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE AQUARIUM AND THEN IT'S GOT THESE PROBES THAT YOU RUN INTO THE AQUARIUM
hD1odl4mEq4_3 0 NOW THESE PROBES AREN'T SELF-ADHESIVE
hD1odl4mEq4_4 0 THEY HAVE LITTLE SUCTION CUPS SO YOU CAN MOVE THEM AROUND AND YOU CAN ADJUST WHERE YOU'RE JUDGING YOUR TEMPERATURE FROM
hD1odl4mEq4_5 0 YOU GET A LITTLE BIT MORE VERSATILITY OUT OF THEM
hD1odl4mEq4_6 0 PLUS THE DIGITAL THERMOMETERS KEEP A RECORD GENERALLY OF THE HIGHEST TEMPERATURE AND LOWEST TEMPERATURE YOU'RE REACHING YOUR AQUARIUM
hD1odl4mEq4_7 0 SO BY HITTING A MEMORY BUTTON YOU CAN GET AN IDEA EVEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT AT HOME OF WHERE YOUR TEMPERATURES ARE WHILE YOU'RE AWAY
hD1odl4mEq4_8 0 THAT WAY YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GETTING SOMETHING THAT'S ALARMINGLY LOW OR ALARMINGLY HIGH YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO ADJUST YOUR HEATING ON YOUR AQUARIUM
hD1odl4mEq4_9 0 NOW WHEN WE'RE PLACING OUR THERMOMETERS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE DIAL ONE AGAIN FOR JUST A SECOND
hD1odl4mEq4_10 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS LIKE I SAID GENERALLY I RECOMMEND HAVING TWO IN AN AQUARIUM
hD1odl4mEq4_11 0 SO WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS YOU WOULD TAKE ONE AND YOU WOULD PUT IT TOWARDS THE TOP IN THE BACK OF THE AQUARIUM ON THE INSIDE TOWARDS THE TOP UNDERNEATH THE HEAT LAMP
hD1odl4mEq4_12 0 AND THEN THE OTHER ONE YOU WOULD TAKE AND YOU WOULD PUT TOWARDS THE BOTTOM ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
hD1odl4mEq4_13 0 NOW THAT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU A HEAT GRADIENT OF THE AQUARIUM
hD1odl4mEq4_14 0 IT'S GOING TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT THE LOWEST TEMPERATURE IS AND THE HIGHEST TEMPERATURE
hD1odl4mEq4_15 0 THAT WAY YOU KNOW THAT YOUR WHOLE TANK IS WELL WITHIN THE LIMITS OF WHAT YOU NEED TO BE
hD1odl4mEq4_16 0 FOR A SAND BOA WE'RE LOOKING SOMEWHERE AROUND 110 DEGREES ONE SIDE AND 85 DEGREES ON THE OTHER
GFVxu_GWJZA_1 0 MIKE LOPEZ HI
GFVxu_GWJZA_2 0 I'M MIKE LOPEZ WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING THE BLACK COLOR FROM MAGIC THE GATHERING
GFVxu_GWJZA_3 0 AND HERE WE HAVE PLAGUE WIND
GFVxu_GWJZA_4 0 PLAGUE WIND IS ANOTHER POWERFUL RESET CARD BUT IT'S A ONE-SIDED RESET CARD WHICH MAKES IT ALL THAT MORE POWERFUL
GFVxu_GWJZA_5 0 IT'S A SORCERY CARD OUT OF THE BASIC SET
GFVxu_GWJZA_6 0 THIS CARD HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE THE ONSLAUGHT BLOCK
GFVxu_GWJZA_7 0 IT IS A RARE OUT OF THE BASIC SET WHICH IS NOW ON ITS 10TH EDITION AS ICON INDICATES HERE
GFVxu_GWJZA_8 0 PLAGUE WIND COST YOU SEVEN AND TWO BLACK PLAGUE WIND COST YOU NINE TO PLAY WHICH MEANS YOU CAN PLAY THIS CARD ON TURN NINE OR IF YOU HAVE MANY CAPABILITIES YOU CAN PLAY THIS CARD A LITTLE SOONER BUT WHAT THIS CARD DOES IT DESTROYS ALL CREATURES YOU DON'T CONTROL
GFVxu_GWJZA_9 0 THEY CAN'T BE REGENERATED
GFVxu_GWJZA_10 0 ONCE AGAIN YOU DESTROY ALL CREATURES YOU DON'T CONTROL SO EVERY PLAYER EVEN IN THE MULTIPLAYER GAME WILL LOSE ALL THEIR CREATURES
GFVxu_GWJZA_11 0 ONCE AGAIN TO ALL THOSE CREATURE DECK SET CREATURES GET BENEFITS FROM OTHER CREATURES THIS TOTALLY ANNIHILATES THEIR DECK BECAUSE THEIR CREATURES ARE NOT IN PLAY TO GET THE OTHER CREATURES BENEFITS AND BASICALLY THEY HAVE TO START OVER WITH BUILDING THEIR ARMY WHICH ALLOWS YOU TIME TO BREAK OUT YOUR SPELLS AND/OR ATTACK WITH YOUR CREATURES THAT ARE STILL IN PLAY
GvxXn_w3j5U_1 0 GPM STANDS FOR GALLONS PER MINUTE
GvxXn_w3j5U_2 0 AND THAT DETERMINES HOW MUCH WATER COMES OUT YOUR SHOWER WHEN YOU'RE TAKING A SHOWER
GvxXn_w3j5U_3 0 YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT A LOW FLOW SHOWER HEAD
GvxXn_w3j5U_4 0 LOW FLOW SHOWER HEAD COME IN TWO DIFFERENT KINDS
GvxXn_w3j5U_5 0 WE HAVE ONE THAT'S AERATING AND ONE THAT IS NOT AERATING
GvxXn_w3j5U_6 0 THE AERATING ONE WE'LL TALK ABOUT AND NON AERATING ONE WE'LL ALSO TALK ABOUT
GvxXn_w3j5U_7 0 SHOWER USES COUNT FOR ALMOST 25 %PERCENT OF AMERICA WATER USAGE BY INDIVIDUAL
GvxXn_w3j5U_8 0 MANY SHOWER HEAD FIXTURE MADE PRIOR TO 1992 LACK ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND THEY ALSO ALLOW WATER FLOW UP TO FIVE GALLONS PER MINUTE
GvxXn_w3j5U_9 0 WHICH IS NINETEEN LITERS PER MINUTE
GvxXn_w3j5U_10 0 BETTER REGULATIONS MANDATE THAT NEW SHOWER HEAD FLOW RATE CANNOT EXCEED MORE THAN 2.5 GALLONS PER MINUTE
GvxXn_w3j5U_11 0 A WATER PRESSURE OF EIGHTY POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH
GvxXn_w3j5U_12 0 HI THIS DAVID FOSTER ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GvxXn_w3j5U_13 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF BASICALLY TAKING THE SHOWER HEAD OFF
GlyZjKn2fI8_1 0 7.FOR WOMEN'S SELF DEFENSE AND PERSONAL PROTECTION ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT WE WANT TO SHOW YOU ARE WRIST ESCAPES OR ESCAPES FROM GRABS
GlyZjKn2fI8_2 0 THE FIRST THING WE'LL DO IS A WRIST GRAB
GlyZjKn2fI8_3 0 IN THIS SITUATION RIGHT HERE THERESA IS GRABBING ME STRAIGHT ACROSS
GlyZjKn2fI8_4 0 AND THIS PRINCIPLE WORKS FOR PRETTY MUCH ANY GRAB
GlyZjKn2fI8_5 0 NOW UNDERSTAND THE WE ARE WORKING JUST ESCAPES RIGHT NOW
GlyZjKn2fI8_6 0 ULTIMATELY IF YOU WERE TO REALLY BEGIN TO STUDY PERSONAL PROTECTION AND SELF DEFENSE WE'D HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ELSE AS WELL
GlyZjKn2fI8_7 0 THEY ARE NOT GOING TO
GlyZjKn2fI8_8 0 I'M NOT GOING TO BREAK MY HAND LOOSE AND THEIR GOING TO GO HEY GREAT JOB
GlyZjKn2fI8_9 0 THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO ATTACK
GlyZjKn2fI8_10 0 HOWEVER LET'S FOCUS ON JUST GETTING LOOSE FIRST
GlyZjKn2fI8_11 0 WHEN THERESA GRABS ME I HAVE TWO PRIMARY POINTS OF CONTROL I HAVE FOUR FINGERS HERE AND I HAVE ONE THUMB
GlyZjKn2fI8_12 0 IT'S MUCH EASIER FOR ME JUST TO GO OUT OVER THE THUMB
GlyZjKn2fI8_13 0 I'M NOT GOING TO PHYSICALLY FORCE MYSELF OUT IN THE EVEN THAT MY ATTACKER IS REALLY STRONG
GlyZjKn2fI8_14 0 I WANT TO USE MY ENTIRE BODY AND ROLL OUT OVER THE THUMB
GlyZjKn2fI8_15 0 USING MY ENTIRE BODY I BREAK FREE
GlyZjKn2fI8_16 0 NOW LET'S DO THAT AGAIN
GlyZjKn2fI8_17 0 THIS TIME I'LL GRAB THERESA
GlyZjKn2fI8_18 0 I'M GOING TO COME IN AND GRAB HER REALLY HARD AND SHE'LL GIVE A WRIST ESCAPE FOR US
GlyZjKn2fI8_19 0 LET'S DO THAT ONE MORE TIME
GlyZjKn2fI8_21 0 SO A GOOD TECHNIQUE TO UNDERSTAND IN WOMEN'S SELF DEFENSE AND PERSONAL PROTECTION IS A GOOD WRIST ESCAPE
hjGEcEr8DP4_1 0 HI THIS IS MIKE LOPEZ FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'LL BE DISCUSSING THE RED MAGIC COLOR
hjGEcEr8DP4_2 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER STUN
hjGEcEr8DP4_3 0 STUN IS ANOTHER GREAT CARD RED
hjGEcEr8DP4_4 0 IT'S CHEAP IT'S QUICK IT'S FAST
hjGEcEr8DP4_5 0 IT'S AN INSTANT YOU CAN PLAY IT AT ANY TIME
hjGEcEr8DP4_6 0 IT'S ONE AND A RED
hjGEcEr8DP4_7 0 FOR ONE AND A RED TARGET CREATURE CAN'T BLOCK THIS TURN
hjGEcEr8DP4_8 0 MEANS YOU TARGET A CREATURE YOUR OPPONENT CONTROLS AND YOU CAN DO THIS BEFORE THE BLOCKING IS INITIATED YOU CAN DO IT BEFORE COMBAT IS INITIATED
hjGEcEr8DP4_9 0 YOU CAN SAY THAT PARTICULAR CREATURE CANNOT BLOCK THIS TURN AND IT CAN'T BLOCK DURING THIS TURN
hjGEcEr8DP4_10 0 YOU ALSO GET TO DRAW A CARD
hjGEcEr8DP4_11 0 WHICH IS VERY POWERFUL BECAUSE YOU JUST PLAYED A CARD FROM YOUR HAND AND YOU GET A FREE CARD BECAUSE REMEMBER YOU CAN ONLY DRAW A CARD ONCE A TURN
hjGEcEr8DP4_12 0 ONCE AGAIN THIS IS GREAT GIVES YOU A CARD PREVENTS A PERSON FROM BLOCKING
hjGEcEr8DP4_13 0 ALLOWS YOUR ATTACKERS TO GET THROUGH
hjGEcEr8DP4_14 0 VERY POWERFUL VERY CHEAP
hjGEcEr8DP4_15 0 COMMON TWENTY-FIVE CENTS NEED FOUR OF THEM
GhYx9UVbXvc_1 0 ALRIGHT SO WHENEVER WE ARE DOING ANY EXERCISE WHERE WE REALLY WANT TO SLIM DOWN OR TRIM DOWN THE FAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS FOCUS ON CARDIO AS WELL
GhYx9UVbXvc_2 0 SO IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS AB WORKOUT I LIKE TO ADD MORE CARDIOVASCULAR TYPE THINGS
GhYx9UVbXvc_3 0 PLYOMETRICS ARE GREAT WHICH MEANS ADDING A JUMP TO ANY EXERCISE
GhYx9UVbXvc_4 0 SO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO NOW IS SQUAT JUMPS AND THIS IS REALLY GOOD BECAUSE IT REALLY HELPS THE LEGS
GhYx9UVbXvc_5 0 AND ALSO YOUR CORE
GhYx9UVbXvc_6 0 WHEN YOU ARE HOLDING A GOOD SQUAT YOUR CORE IS REALLY HOLDING YOUR BODY INTO POSITION CORRECTLY
GhYx9UVbXvc_7 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO ADD THIS EXERCISE WHICH GREAT FOR TONING THE LEGS THE BUTT AND ALSO THE CORE
GhYx9UVbXvc_8 0 MAKING IT STRONGER AND IT'S GOING TO GIVE US A CARDIO BURST
GhYx9UVbXvc_9 0 SO A SQUAT JUMP LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
GhYx9UVbXvc_10 0 FEET ARE ABOUT SHOULDER LENGTH APART AND WE ARE GOING TO SQUAT DOWN
GhYx9UVbXvc_11 0 MAKE SURE THE KNEES ARE NOT EXTENDING THE TOES SO WE ARE SQUATTING AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO JUMP
GhYx9UVbXvc_12 0 THEN WE COME BACK DOWN INTO A SQUAT AND JUMP
GhYx9UVbXvc_14 0 REMEMBER TO BREATH
GhYx9UVbXvc_15 0 AND IT LOOKS LIKE THAT
GhYx9UVbXvc_16 0 NOW WHEN I DO SQUAT JUMPS I LIKE DO SETS OF 25 AND WHEN YOU DO 25 OF THESE YOU'LL REALLY START FEELING IT AND THAT CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM IS REALLY WORKING AND PUMPING REALLY GOOD
_gXgil2GR2k_1 0 OKAY THE DRINK THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE IS CALLED A BANDERAS
_gXgil2GR2k_2 0 AND TRADITIONALLY THIS IS MADE AS THREE SHOTS AND EACH SHOT IS GOING TO RESEMBLE THE COLORS OF THE MEXICAN FLAG WHICH ARE RED WHITE AND GREEN
_gXgil2GR2k_3 0 NOW IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A WHITE TEQUILA BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A WHITE TEQUILA YOU CAN USE ANY TEQUILA THAT YOU HAVE IN THIS CASE WE'VE GOT GOLD TEQUILA
_gXgil2GR2k_4 0 SO INSTEAD OF MAKING IT LOOK LIKE THREE SHOTS THAT DON'T RESEMBLE THE COLORS OF THE MEXICAN FLAG WE'RE JUST GOING TO MAKE IT AS A COCKTAIL
_gXgil2GR2k_5 0 SO THERE'S ONE SHOT OF TEQUILA AND WE'LL DO ABOUT A 1/2 A SHOT OF LEMON JUICE AND FOLLOW IT UP WITH A SHOT OF TOMATO JUICE THERE WE GO
_gXgil2GR2k_6 0 AND WE'LL MIX THIS UP REAL GOOD
_gXgil2GR2k_7 0 AND BANDERAS IS SPANISH FOR FLAG SO OBVIOUSLY I GUESS YOU JUST GOT A LITTLE SPANISH LESSON THERE
_gXgil2GR2k_8 0 LETS SET UP A GLASS AND POUR IT IN GIVE IT A STRAW AND BOTTOMS UP
Gzw1Wi4-S9s_1 0 THERE'S A MISUNDERSTANDING THAT ART IS ABOUT HAVING GOOD HAND EYE COORDINATION
Gzw1Wi4-S9s_2 0 PART OF IT IS BEING ABLE TO MAKE YOUR HAND DO WHAT YOU WANT IT TO DO BUT THE BIGGEST PART OF BEING ABLE TO DRAW IS BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE PUT ON YOUR PAPER AND THEN LOOK AT THE THING YOU'RE DRAWING AT AND BEING ABLE TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE
Gzw1Wi4-S9s_3 0 BEING ABLE TO SEE IF YOU'RE DRAWING A FACE AND YOU DREW IT TOO WIDE OR TOO NARROW BECAUSE IT'S CHARACTERISTICS LIKE THAT THAT SAY FOR INSTANCE ON FACES MAKES PEOPLE LOOK LIKE WHO THEY LOOK LIKE IF THEY HAVE A BIG FOREHEAD OR THEY HAVE A SMALL NOSE THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT AND IN ORDER TO BE AN ARTIST WHO IS GOOD AT DRAWING THINGS ACCURATELY YOU HAVE TO TRAIN YOUR EYE SO THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT THINGS AND BE ABLE TO TELL IMMEDIATELY WHAT IS WRONG BETWEEN YOUR DRAWING AND THE THING THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DRAW AND THEN YOU'RE ABLE TO CORRECT IT
Gzw1Wi4-S9s_4 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON SOME EXERCISES THAT ARE GOING TO HELP TRAIN YOUR EYE TO DO THAT
GiuxZk5Zo5Y_1 0 WHAT I THINK OF PEER TUTORING
GiuxZk5Zo5Y_2 0 PEER TUTORING IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST THINGS YOU CAN DO AS A STUDENT TO GET YOUR OWN UNDERSTANDING OF THE THE MATERIAL DOWN PAT
GiuxZk5Zo5Y_3 0 THAT IS DEFINITELY DOUBTLESS AN EXCELLENT TOOL TO BE USED AS A STUDENT
GiuxZk5Zo5Y_4 0 WHAT YOU GOTTA DO IS TEACH YOUR NEIGHBOR IN CLASS HOW THE EXCITED ELECTRON STATES WORK WHATEVER AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF IT CAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO ASK YOU QUESTIONS OH WELL WHAT ABOUT WHEN THIS HAPPENS
GiuxZk5Zo5Y_5 0 YOU NEED TO BE LIKE OKAY WELL I'M NOT QUITE SURE
GiuxZk5Zo5Y_6 0 LET'S GO TO THE BOOK FOR THE ANSWER OR WHATEVER
GiuxZk5Zo5Y_7 0 THE THERE THAT IS A REALLY GOOD WAY TO TEST YOUR THE THOROUGHNESS OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND THE THE DETAIL OF THE PICTURE YOU'VE PAINTED YOURSELF
GiuxZk5Zo5Y_8 0 SO YEAH THAT'S THAT'S PEER TUTORING
GiuxZk5Zo5Y_9 0 IT'S AN EXTREMELY USEFUL TOOL AS A STUDENT TO BE ABLE TO TELL OTHER PEOPLE HOW SOMETHING WORKS
GiuxZk5Zo5Y_10 0 THAT MEANS THAT MEANS PRETTY MUCH YOU ARE THEN THE TEACHER
GiuxZk5Zo5Y_11 0 THAT TO ME IS PEER TUTORING
GSlGfbV2T7Q_2 0 I'M LEAH FROM REFUEL SPA AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GSlGfbV2T7Q_3 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MOISTURE APPLICATION

GSlGfbV2T7Q_15 0 I'M JUST GOING TO SPOT TREAT RIGHT UNDER THE EYES HERE AND DOT AND BLEND OUT
GSlGfbV2T7Q_16 0 YOU CAN SEE IT HAS THAT NICE REFLETIVE QUALITY TO IT

GSlGfbV2T7Q_19 0 JUST KIND OF SMOOTH IT OUT FOR YOUR CLIENT
GSlGfbV2T7Q_20 0 THEN FROM THERE YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN YOUR APPLICATION
GSlGfbV2T7Q_21 0 WATCH OUR NEXT SEGMENT ON MINERAL COSMETICS
gheC2weNHoU_1 0 HI THIS IS NICKI WITH BABY SIGNS ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gheC2weNHoU_2 0 AND IN THIS CLIP WE'LL TALK ABOUT USING BABY SIGNS IN A BILINGUAL SETTING
gheC2weNHoU_3 0 IN MANY FAMILIES THERE IS A BILINGUAL SITUATION WHERE ONE PARENT MIGHT SPEAK A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE THAN THE OTHER PARENT OR THERE MIGHT BE OTHER CAREGIVERS GRANDPARENTS CHILD CARE CENTERS WHERE THE CHILD HEARS MORE THAN ONE LANGUAGE
gheC2weNHoU_4 0 USING BABY SIGNS IS ABSOLUTELY INVALUABLE IN THAT SITUATION BECAUSE THE SIGN IS THE SAME NO MATTER WHAT LANGUAGE YOU SAY THE WORD IN
gheC2weNHoU_5 0 SO IF I WOULD SHOW YOU THE SIGN FOR MILK WHICH IS JUST LIKE THIS SQUEEZING YOUR FIST IN AND OUT
gheC2weNHoU_6 0 THE SIGN IS THE SAME WHETHER YOU SAY MILK OR FOR INSTANCE LECHE
gheC2weNHoU_7 0 SO THE BABY MAKES THAT CONNECTION THEY LEARN TO ASSOCIATE THE SIGN WITH THE WORD IN BOTH LANGUAGES AND IT HELPS THEM BRIDGE THAT GAP BETWEEN THE TWO DIFFERENT LANGUAGES
gheC2weNHoU_8 0 IT HELPS THEM LEARN IT MORE QUICKLY
gheC2weNHoU_9 0 FREQUENTLY CHILDREN WHO HEAR DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SOMETIMES THEY DON'T LEARN EACH LANGUAGE AS QUICKLY BUT USING THE BABY SIGN WILL DEFINITELY BRIDGE THAT GAP AND IT WILL HELP THEM SPEED UP THE UNDERSTANDING

gUYnOMpsfrs_1 0 HI IN THIS SESSION WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT A SONG CALLED BEAUMONT RAG AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ELEMENTS OF RAGTIME MUSIC
gUYnOMpsfrs_2 0 RAGTIME MUSIC IS BLUES BASED AND IT'S KIND OF GETTING AT SOME OF THE TENDENCIES THAT KIND OF EVOLVED INTO JAZZ
gUYnOMpsfrs_3 0 THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO ENCOUNTER ARE DOMINANT CHORDS RHYTHM CHANGES WHICH IS A GROUP OF CHORDS MOVING TOGETHER THAT WE'VE KIND OF CATEGORIZED AS RHYTHM CHANGES AND THE CONCEPT OF WHAT YOU CALL TURNAROUND WHICH IS IN BLUES THERE'S USUALLY A TURNAROUND AND IF YOU LISTEN TO BLUES MUSIC YOU'LL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
gUYnOMpsfrs_4 0 BUT YOU'LL HAVE KIND OF A THOSE KIND OF SOUNDS THAT ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF RAGTIME OR EARLY SWING
gUYnOMpsfrs_5 0 MELODICALLY WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT CHROMATICISM AND THINGS THAT ARE A LITTLE MORE DISSONANT AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE OF A MAJOR SCALE BUT THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN LEARNING HOW TO PLAY THIS STYLE OF MUSIC

Hc-eMUP4N1c_9 0 WATER DRINKS WITH ELECTROLYTES I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND TOO MANY SPORTS DRINKS

HfNZDZc4eCI_2 0 MY NAME IS BILL KOSMAS
HfNZDZc4eCI_3 0 I'M THE OWNER OF GREENHOUSE EFFECT AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM I WILL BE TRYING TODAY TO SHOW YOU AN EASY WAY OF MAKING A BATTER FOR CREPES
HfNZDZc4eCI_4 0 AFTER THE BATTER HAS COOLED OFF WE WILL TAKE IT AND SLOWLY POUR IT INSIDE THE BATTER SO THAT IT'LL ALL MIX REAL GOOD TO A POINT THAT IT COMES OUT REAL NICE AND SMOOTH
HfNZDZc4eCI_5 0 THE BUTTER IS INSIDE THEN WE TAKE IT AND LET IT RUN UNTIL EVERYTHING IS MIXED UP COMPLETELY
HfNZDZc4eCI_6 0 WHEN EVERYTHING IS MIXED UP WE'LL TAKE A BUCKET
HfNZDZc4eCI_7 0 IT DEPENDS IF YOU DO IT FROM HOME YOU CAN GET A SMALL PAN
HfNZDZc4eCI_8 0 I DO IT IN LARGE AMOUNTS SO I NEED A BIGGER PAN
HfNZDZc4eCI_9 0 IT'S ABOUT TWO GALLONS THAT I MAKE EVERY BATCH AND I NEED TO
HfNZDZc4eCI_10 0 YOU HAVE TO TAKE A SCREEN ALMOST SIMILAR TO THIS AND PLACE IT HERE SO THAT WAY YOU CAN STRAIN THE BATTER
HfNZDZc4eCI_11 0 FLOUR USUALLY DOES NOT DISSOLVE COMPLETELY SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT AND RUN IT THROUGH THE SCREEN BECAUSE YOU NEED THE BATTER TO FLOW
HfNZDZc4eCI_12 0 IF THE BATTER DOESN'T FLOW THEN THE CRUST DOES NOT COME OUT RIGHT
H5vPVyDO1Yo_1 0 WHEN WE MAKE A CROWN WHICH LOOKS NATURAL THE SUBSTRUCTURE CAN BE BASICALLY NON METAL WHICH IS THIS IS BASICALLY PLASTIC THAT WE USE A SPECIAL TYPE OF PLASTIC THAT'S VERY HARD WITH THE PORCELAIN COVERING IT SO IT MAKES IT LOOKS VERY NATURAL
H5vPVyDO1Yo_2 0 OR THIS IS NOT PLASTIC BUT WITH HIGH NOBLE METAL OR WHITE GOLD OR YELLOW GOLD
H5vPVyDO1Yo_3 0 ANY OTHER MATERIAL THAT IS NON GOLD THAT FORM THE SUBSTRUCTURE WITH THE PORCELAIN COVERING IT IS HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED
H5vPVyDO1Yo_4 0 MAINLY BECAUSE THE NONMETAL OR BASE METAL IS GOING TO CAUSE CORROSION
H5vPVyDO1Yo_5 0 AND THAT CORROSION WILL LEAD TO IRRITATION OF TISSUE AND SOMETIME TO THE FAILURE OF THE IMPLANT
H5vPVyDO1Yo_6 0 THIS IS WHERE THERE IS A BIG PRICE DIFFERENCE ESPECIALLY WITH THE PRICE OF GOLD TODAY
H5vPVyDO1Yo_7 0 IT'S VERY HIGH
H5vPVyDO1Yo_8 0 DO YOU DEVIATE AWAY FROM THERE
H5vPVyDO1Yo_10 0 PURE AND SIMPLE YOU JUST CANNOT
H5vPVyDO1Yo_11 0 YOU STILL GOT TO USE THE PRODUCT BECAUSE WE KNOW GOLD IS VERY ADAPTABLE IN THE MOUTH AND THE BODY IS VERY FORGIVING WITH THE GOLD
H5vPVyDO1Yo_12 0 WITH ANY OTHER TYPE OF METAL IT IS NOT
H5vPVyDO1Yo_13 0 IT WILL CREATE CORROSION IRRITATION TO THE TISSUE
H5vPVyDO1Yo_14 0 SOMETIMES EVEN AN ALLERGIC RESPONSE IT WILL CAUSE FAILURES
H5vPVyDO1Yo_15 0 AND THAT'S WHY YOU WANT THE SUBSTRUCTURE TO BE BASICALLY A NONMETAL OR HIGH NOBLE METAL AND THEN THE PORCELAIN GOES OVER THE METAL
H5vPVyDO1Yo_16 0 PORCELAIN ALSO COMES IN VARIOUS TYPE DIFFERENT GRADE CHEAP GRADE EXPENSIVE GRADE
H5vPVyDO1Yo_17 0 YOU WANT THE TYPE THAT BASICALLY OF THE HIGH GRADE SO THAT IT DOESN'T CHIP OR BREAK VERY EASILY
H5vPVyDO1Yo_18 0 ONE OF THE TYPES THAT'S VERY POPULAR ON THE MARKET IS CALLED FINESSE PORCELAIN
H5vPVyDO1Yo_19 0 THAT CAN BE USED IN THE FRONT OR IN THE BACK
H5vPVyDO1Yo_20 0 THEY'RE VERY STRONG AND IT HAS SOME SPRING TO IT BELIEVE IT OR NOT
H5vPVyDO1Yo_21 0 AND SO THE FRACTURE RATE IS VERY VERY LOW

-GEpzX2s858_1 0 EVERY GIRL HAS HER FAVORITE BRAND
-GEpzX2s858_2 0 AS A HAIRSTYLIST MY FAVORITE BRAND IS DEFINITELY HOT TOOLS
-GEpzX2s858_3 0 I'M LAURA GIBSON HAIR AND BEAUTY EXPERT AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU WHY HOT TOOLS IS THE RIGHT CURLING IRON FOR YOU
-GEpzX2s858_4 0 FIRST OF ALL LET'S START OFF WITH THE BASICS
-GEpzX2s858_5 0 IT HAS CERAMIC BARREL IT'S PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT YOU WANT WHEN CHOOSING A CURLING IRON BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO SAVE YOUR HAIR IT'S NOT GOING TO BURN IT IT'S GOING TO SEAL IT IT'S GOING TO HAVE NICE SHINE RATHER THAN A NORMAL METAL BARREL WHICH IS JUST GOING TO PULL YOUR HAIR GIVE YOU SPLIT ENDS AND IT'S JUST UGLY I DON'T EVEN WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT IT'S JUST UGLY

G9iDjvQL_mQ_1 0 OK THE NEXT CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SCORING YOUR POINTS OR YOUR BALLS TO MOVE FORWARD TO SINK EVENTUALLY THE EIGHT BALL AND WIN THE GAME
G9iDjvQL_mQ_2 0 ALRIGHT SCORING OCCURS WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR BALLS WHETHER THEY'RE EITHER STRIPES OR SOLIDS
G9iDjvQL_mQ_3 0 WE KNOW THAT IF YOU MAKE A LEGAL SHOT YOU GET TO SCORE AGAIN AND CONTINUE TO KEEP PLAYING SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A SCENARIO WHERE I'M STRIPES AND THERE'S TWO BALLS AND I'M STILL SHOOTING I COULD SO SOMETHING WHERE I CALL THE TWELVE BALL IN THE CORNER AND TRY TO STOP THE Q BALL HERE BECAUSE AGAIN AS YOU LEARN POOL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN POSITIONING AND AGAIN THIS IS A DIFFERENT VIDEO WE'RE JUST LEARNING ABOUT THE STRATEGY OF THE GAME AND TRYING TO WIN THE GAME BUT I WOULD TRY TO MAKE THE TWELVE THE TEN AND NOW ALL MY BALLS ARE DONE
G9iDjvQL_mQ_4 0 NOW I'M IN CONTINGENT TO WINNING THE GAME
G9iDjvQL_mQ_5 0 AGAIN SCORING THE BALLS IS WHEN YOU LEGALLY POCKET ALL OF YOUR BALLS WHETHER THEY BE THE STRIPES OR THE SOLIDS
G9iDjvQL_mQ_6 0 DON'T GET SCORING CONFUSED WITH POINTS
G9iDjvQL_mQ_7 0 SCORING JUST MEANS THAT YOU HAVE ALL THE SEVEN BALLS IN THE STRIPES OR ALL THE SEVEN BALLS IN THE SOLIDS
G9iDjvQL_mQ_8 0 SO THIS MIGHT BE A SCENARIO WHERE I HAVE TWO BALLS LEFT AND THE EIGHT
G9iDjvQL_mQ_9 0 I'M TRYING TO GET THAT EIGHT BALL BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU WIN YOU HAVE TO MAKE LEGAL SHOTS
G9iDjvQL_mQ_10 0 LET ME JUST SHOW YOU THE LEGAL SHOTS I WOULD MAKE HERE ON THE TWELVE AND ON THE TEN BALL OF THE STRIPES
G9iDjvQL_mQ_11 0 I WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE BALL IN THE CORNER POCKETWHICH I WOULD MAKE AND THEN I WOULD PUT MYSELF IN A POSITION YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TRY TO PLAY POSITION IT'S ANOTHER VIDEO TAPE FOLKS BUT I PUT MYSELF IN SUCH A POSITION NOW THAT I COULD PLAY THE TEN BALL IN THIS CORNER AND MAKE MY Q BALL COME OUT FOR A GOOD POSITIONING SHOT FOR THE EIGHT BALL AND WINNING THE GAME
G9iDjvQL_mQ_12 0 SO I WOULD SAY TEN BALL IN THE CORNER AND YOU SEE THE Q BALL COMES OUT TO A POSITION ON THE TABLE WHERE I HAVE A NICE SHOT AN ANGLE SHOT FOR THE EIGHT BALL IN THE CORNER
G9iDjvQL_mQ_13 0 THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WHEN POCKETING YOUR BALLS LEGALLY AND SCORING ALL OF YOUR BALLS FIRST BEFORE YOUR OPPONENT DOES AND GIVING YOU A GOOD EXECUTION SHOT FOR WINNING THE GAME AND SHOOTING THE EIGHT BALL IN CLEAN
G5I3Jru9zAw_1 0 HI I'M HOLLY HEIDEMANN AND TODAY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE EQUIPMENT INVOLVED WITH BARREL RACING
G5I3Jru9zAw_2 0 THE NUMBER ONE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT I HAVE ALL THE CHILDREN AND YOUNG RIDERS PUT ON IS A HELMET
G5I3Jru9zAw_3 0 MANY PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT HELMETS BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT I WON'T MENTION NAMES BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT HAVE SUFFERED FALLS AND HAD SOME REALLY SERIOUS INJURIES BECAUSE OF FALLING FROM A HORSE
G5I3Jru9zAw_4 0 A BEGINNER RIDER OR A RIDER THAT'S INEXPERIENCED OR A YOUNG RIDER SHOULD DEFINITELY WEAR A HELMET
G5I3Jru9zAw_5 0 AS YOU ADVANCE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE NOT TO WEAR THEM THAT IS A CHOICE THAT'S UP TO YOU BUT I LIKE ALL YOUNG RIDERS AND ALL INEXPERIENCED RIDERS TO MAKE SURE THEY WEAR A HELMET
G5I3Jru9zAw_6 0 A HELMET DOES NOT PROTECT YOU FROM EVERYTHING YOU STILL HAVE TO USE REALLY GOOD COMMON SENSE
G5I3Jru9zAw_7 0 THE ONE THING YOU WANT TO WATCH IS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FOOTING IN THE ARENA IS VERY GOOD THAT'S A SAFETY FEATURE
G5I3Jru9zAw_8 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN CARE OF THE GROUND
G5I3Jru9zAw_9 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE YOU KNOW WHERE THE GATE IS IF YOUR HORSE IS A FREE RUNNER THAT YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO STOP ONCE YOU GET OUT THE GATE
G5I3Jru9zAw_10 0 THERE ARE MANY SAFETY FEATURES INVOLVED IT ALL STARTS WITH THE HELMET
G5I3Jru9zAw_11 0 I RIDE WITH SPURS
G5I3Jru9zAw_12 0 THIS IS A PRETTY HEAVY SET OF SPURS
G5I3Jru9zAw_13 0 YOU CAN HAVE ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF SPURS
G5I3Jru9zAw_14 0 SPURS A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE ARE TOO AGGRESSIVE AND EVEN ABUSIVE TO A HORSE
G5I3Jru9zAw_15 0 SPURS ARE ONLY ABUSIVE IF THE RIDER USES THEM THAT WAY
G5I3Jru9zAw_16 0 I LIKE TO USE SPURS AS AN EXTENSION OF MY LEG
G5I3Jru9zAw_17 0 I'M VERY CAREFUL NOT TO GOUGE A HORSE
G5I3Jru9zAw_18 0 IT'S A TOUCH AND ALL IT IS IS TO MAKE THINGS VERY LIGHT FOR YOUR HORSE
G5I3Jru9zAw_19 0 YOU'RE NOT KICKING THE AIR OUT OF THEM YOU'RE JUST USING THAT AS AN EXTENSION SO THEY CAN FEEL ALL OF YOUR CUES
G5I3Jru9zAw_20 0 THIS IS A CAVISION
G5I3Jru9zAw_21 0 THIS HAS BECOME ONE OF MY MOST FAVORITE PIECES OF EQUIPMENT
G5I3Jru9zAw_22 0 THE REASON WHY IS IT HOLDS THE HORSE'S MOUTH CLOSED
G5I3Jru9zAw_23 0 IF YOU'VE EVER NOTICED WHEN YOU PULL ON YOUR HORSE AND THEY GO TO OPEN THEIR MOUTH YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY KIND OF CONTROL OUT OF THAT
G5I3Jru9zAw_24 0 THIS CREATES THEM NOT BEING ABLE TO DO THAT
G5I3Jru9zAw_25 0 SO MOST OF MY HORSES WHEN I'M DOING MY HORSEMANSHIP WHICH WE'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT I LIKE TO USE SOME KIND OF A RING SNAFFLE OR A D-RING SNAFFLE MEANING IT'S VERY CLOSE TO THE HORSE'S SIDES OF THEIR MOUTH WHERE THE CONTACT COMES WITH THE REINS
G5I3Jru9zAw_26 0 AND THEN THE MOUTHPIECE IS EITHER A TWO OR SOMETIMES A THREE PIECE MOUTHPIECE
G5I3Jru9zAw_27 0 THE OTHER THING I TALKED ABOUT WITH BAILEY WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HIS CONFIRMATION IS THAT HE HAS A VERY SHORT NECK
G5I3Jru9zAw_28 0 BECAUSE HE HAS A SHORT NECK HE HAS A TENDENCY TO ELEVATE HIS HEAD IN HIS TURNS
G5I3Jru9zAw_29 0 NOT TO THE POINT WHERE HE WOULD BE A RUNAWAY OR A PROBLEM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT IT JUST DOESN'T GET ME QUITE AS SNAPPY OF A TURN AS I WOULD LIKE AND SO THIS IS A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT CALLED AN OVER THE POLL TIE DOWN
G5I3Jru9zAw_30 0 AGAIN I'M A BIG FAN FOR HORSES THAT HAVE SHORT NECKS THIS REALLY HELPS THEM
G5I3Jru9zAw_31 0 I DON'T THEM IN THIS ALL THE TIME I ONLY RUN THEM IN IT
G5I3Jru9zAw_32 0 THE REASON WHY IS IT GOES OVER THEIR HEAD BEHIND THEIR EARS AND OVER THEIR EYES
G5I3Jru9zAw_33 0 AND WHAT THAT DOES IS WHEN THEY ELEVATE THEIR HEAD IT PUTS PRESSURE ON IT AND BRINGS IT BACK DOWN
G5I3Jru9zAw_34 0 A HORSE THAT GETS USED TO THIS KNOWS IT'S THERE AND BAILEY WILL JUST KIND OF RUN AND KEEP HIS HEAD A LITTLE LOWER
G5I3Jru9zAw_35 0 HE RUNS MUCH MORE COMFORTABLY THAT WAY
G5I3Jru9zAw_36 0 IF YOU WERE TO WORK A HORSE IN THAT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT ALL THE TIME IT COULD MAKE THEM SORE OVER TIME AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT
G5I3Jru9zAw_37 0 SO I AS SOON AS THEY KNOW IT'S THERE I GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT OFF WHEN I'M WORKING THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THEN JUST GO BACK TO USING IT WHEN I RUN THEM
G5I3Jru9zAw_38 0 AS FAR AS REINS GO I LIKE LEATHER REINS
G5I3Jru9zAw_39 0 ONE REASON THAT THEY'RE NICE IS THAT THEY FEEL REALLY GOOD IN YOUR HANDS
G5I3Jru9zAw_40 0 THE OTHER THING I LIKE ABOUT THEM I LIKE THESE BRAIDED ONES BECAUSE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF FRICTION THERE LIKE WHEN YOU PULL THE REINS THROUGH YOUR HAND IT DOESN'T PULL THROUGH
G5I3Jru9zAw_41 0 IT'S A NICE NICE SET OF REINS
G5I3Jru9zAw_42 0 I LIKE MY REINS FAIRLY SHORT
G5I3Jru9zAw_43 0 WHEN YOU RUN YOU'LL NOTICE THAT WHEN I GO TO WORK MY HORSE IN A FEW MINUTES
G5I3Jru9zAw_44 0 IF YOUR REINS ARE NOT SHORT WHEN YOU GO TO TAKE THAT TURN AROUND THE BARREL WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE TO MUCH FLAPPAGE ON THE OUTSIDE AND THEY CAN JUST KIND OF FADE AWAY FROM IT
G5I3Jru9zAw_45 0 SO IF YOU'RE HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THAT SHORTEN UP YOUR REINS
G5I3Jru9zAw_46 0 THIS IS THE OTHER PIECE OF EQUIPMENT I USE ON MY HORSE
G5I3Jru9zAw_47 0 THESE ARE CALLED OVERREACH BOOTS
G5I3Jru9zAw_48 0 THEY'RE A LITTLE DIRTY BECAUSE I JUST RAN THIS WEEKEND IN THEM BUT YOU'LL NOTICE THESE HAVE A LITTLE BULB IN THE BACK THAT JUST KEEPS THOSE FROM TURNING AROUND
G5I3Jru9zAw_49 0 IT'S VERY UNCOMFORTABLE THE HORSE'S LEG WOULD BE LIKE THIS SAY THIS WAS TO TURN AROUND AND THEY'D BE TRYING TO RUN WITH THAT AGAINST THEM
G5I3Jru9zAw_50 0 IT'S REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE
G5I3Jru9zAw_51 0 SO MAKE SURE YOU GET A KIND THAT HAVE A BULB IN IT LIKE THIS TO TRY AND KEEP THEM FROM TURNING IT
G5I3Jru9zAw_52 0 IT WON'T WORK A HUNDRED PERCENT BUT IT WILL HELP
gxPOvjOIsUM_1 0 HI IM KELLY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE IM GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME TIPS AND TECHNIQUES THAT I USE WHEN CONCEALING DARK CIRCLES UNDER THE EYES
gxPOvjOIsUM_2 0 SOME PEOPLE WILL USE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF COLOR CORRECTIVE CONCEALERS WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO COVER MORE SERIOUS DISCOLORATIONS AROUND THE EYE AREA
gxPOvjOIsUM_3 0 SO YOU CAN USE MOST OF THE TIME YOU'LL GET ALOT OF SHADOW RIGHT HERE IN THE INNER PART OF THE EYE WHICH WILL BE MORE OF A PURPLEISH COLOR SO YOU WOULD WANNA USE A YELLOW CONCEALER TO HELP YOU NEUTRALIZE WITH THAT
gxPOvjOIsUM_4 0 YOU ALSO MAY HAVE A PERSON WHO USE A LITTLE MORE RED OR A LITTLE MORE SWELLING UNDER THE EYE SO THAT IT USUALLY WOULD BE UNDER THE LASH LINE THE LOWER LASH LINE SO YOU WOULD WANNA USE A GREEN BASE THERE
gxPOvjOIsUM_5 0 SOMETIMES YOU WILL SEE PEOPLE WITH VEINS OR BLOOD VESSELS THAT ARE REALLY CLOSE TO THE SURFACE MORE OF A BLUISH TINGE AND THAT WOULD USUALLY BE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN THE EYE SOCKET SO YOU MAY WANNA USE A PINK CONCEALER THERE TO HELP COVER THAT UP A LITTLE BIT
gxPOvjOIsUM_6 0 OR IF YOU HAVE ALOT OF BLUE IN THE CORNER OF THE EYE YOU MAY WANNA USE A PINK THERE THAT WILL REALLY HELP TO BRIGHTEN UP THE EYE AS WELL
gxPOvjOIsUM_7 0 SO YOU CAN DEFINITELY INCORPORATE DIFFERENT COLORS OF COLOR CORRECTING CONCEALER INTO YOUR UNDER EYE AREA INTO YOUR COVERING REGIMEN TO GIVE YOU BETTER COVERAGE AND JUST TO DETERMINE WHAT KIND OF DISCOLORATION YOU HAVE IN WHICH AREA AND PUT THAT PROPER CONCEALER THERE BEFORE YOU PUT A CONCEALER THAT MATCHES YOUR SKIN TONE ALL OVER THE ENTIRE EYE
gxPOvjOIsUM_8 0 SO THATS WHERE YOU WOULD WANT TO APPLY COLOR CORRECTIVE CONCEALER
g9At9nuk4ek_1 0 THIS IS CALLED A DOLMAN SLEEVE
g9At9nuk4ek_2 0 AND HERE WE HAVE THE DASH LINES REPRESENTING THE ACTUAL ARM UNDERNEATH THE FABRIC
g9At9nuk4ek_3 0 AND WHEN WE GO TO DRAW IN OUR SLEEVE THERE'S DIFFERENT
g9At9nuk4ek_4 0 DOLMAN CAN BE ANYTHING FROM A LITTLE BIT LOOSE ON YOUR ARM TO FLOWY LOOSE
g9At9nuk4ek_5 0 IT'S A DIFFERENT GRADES OF DOLMAN
g9At9nuk4ek_6 0 DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS IN LOOSENESS
g9At9nuk4ek_7 0 THIS ONE WE HAVE A ALMOST FITTED TYPE SLEEVE IN THE BACK
g9At9nuk4ek_8 0 NOTICE THAT WITH THE DOLMAN SLEEVE WE VEER OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE ELBOW EVEN THOUGH THE ELBOW IS CROOKED
g9At9nuk4ek_9 0 THAT'S TO SHOW THAT WE'RE ADDING MORE FABRIC TO IT
g9At9nuk4ek_10 0 ITS A LOOSER VERSION OF A FITTED SLEEVE
g9At9nuk4ek_11 0 ALLOWING FOR MORE RANGE OF MOTION AND JUST MORE FABRIC OVERALL
g9At9nuk4ek_12 0 AND WE HAVE THE WRIST LINE AT THE NATURAL WRIST LINE
g9At9nuk4ek_13 0 IF YOU WANT TO GO FURTHER GO FURTHER
g9At9nuk4ek_14 0 BUT TYPICALLY DOLMAN MEANS KIND OF LIKE A PORK CHOP SLEEVE
g9At9nuk4ek_15 0 WHERE ITS GOING TO BE BLOUSIER AT THE BICEP GOING DOWN TO A FITTED WRIST LINE
g9At9nuk4ek_16 0 SO YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE IT TOO BELLED OUT AT THE WRIST LINE BECAUSE IT CEASES TO BECOME A DOLMAN SLEEVE
g9At9nuk4ek_17 0 SO JUST REMEMBER
g9At9nuk4ek_18 0 EASY WAY TO REMEMBER IS BLOUSEY AT THE TOP
g9At9nuk4ek_19 0 FITTED AT THE BOTTOM
gNX56yonyo4_1 0 MICHAEL PLUNKETT HELLO
gNX56yonyo4_2 0 THIS IS MICHAEL PLUNKETT ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gNX56yonyo4_3 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR D MINOR SHAPE
gNX56yonyo4_4 0 AGAIN REALLY SIMILAR TO OUR D MAJOR SHAPE WE REMEMBER THAT
gNX56yonyo4_5 0 IN ORDER TO MAKE A CHORD MINOR WE TAKE OUR THIRD SCALE DEGREE WHICH WAS BEFORE AN F SHARP AND WE MAKE IT FLAT
gNX56yonyo4_6 0 WE BRING IT DOWN TO A FLAT THREE
gNX56yonyo4_7 0 IN THIS CASE IT WAS BRINGING OUR F SHARP DOWN TO AN F NATURAL
gNX56yonyo4_8 0 SO EVERYTHING ELSE STAYS THE SAME
gNX56yonyo4_9 0 WE'VE GOT OUR D A D AND THEN WE JUST HAVE THAT F NOW WE'RE ON THE FIRST FRET OF THAT STRING INSTEAD OF THE SECOND FRET
gNX56yonyo4_10 0 AGAIN LOOKING AT OUR SCALE DEGREES WE'VE GOT ONE THAT WAS OUR D FIVE OUR A WE HAD ANOTHER D DOWN HERE AND THEN NOW WE'VE GOT OUT FLAT THREE THERE
gNX56yonyo4_11 0 IN ORDER TO PLAY IT IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT
gNX56yonyo4_12 0 INSTEAD OF USING OUR FIRST FINGER TO PLAY THAT A AS WE DID BEFORE ON THE MAJOR WE'RE GOING TO USE OUR SECOND FINGER IN THIS WAY WE CAN GET OUT FIRST FINGER BACK TO EASILY HIT THAT F NATURAL OR JUST THE F ON THE FIRST FRET
gNX56yonyo4_13 0 THAT'S OUR F THERE
gNX56yonyo4_14 0 PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER WE'VE GOT THE D A D AND THE F NATURAL THERE AT THE END
-hANPiHEiXA_1 0 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SHORT TERM BENEFITS OF GETTING THINGS ADJUSTED AND OF COURSE IF SOMEONE IS IN PAIN THEIR IMMEDIATE DESIRE IS TO GET OUT OF PAIN SO USUALLY THE FIRST AND THE MOST QUICKLY RELIEVED SITUATION WITH CHIROPRACTIC CARE IS PAIN
-hANPiHEiXA_2 0 PATIENTS THAT COME IN PAIN USUALLY PRETTY QUICKLY EVEN SOMETIMES AFTER THEIR FIRST PAIN HAVE A REDUCTION IN THEIR PAIN LEVELS
-hANPiHEiXA_3 0 ADDITIONALLY IN THE SHORT TERM WE ARE LOOKING FOR RESPONSES THAT ARE IMPROVED MOBILITY THEY HAVE HAD A LACK OF CERTAIN RANGES OF MOTION AND WE GET THAT STUFF SQUARED AWAY THEY HAVE BETTER FLEXIBILITY AND SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY ARE FEELING LIGHTER ON THEIR FEET
-hANPiHEiXA_4 0 IF THEY ARE HAVING TROUBLE COMPLETING THEIR NORMAL DAILY ACTIVITIES VIA THEIR HOME THEIR WORK WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE WE START TO SEE A RETURN TO MORE NORMAL FUNCTION SO THAT DAILY ACTIVITY IS NOT SO MUCH OF A CHORE AND THERE IS NO LIMITATIONS TO DOING THOSE THINGS
-hANPiHEiXA_5 0 THEY MAY BE SLEEPING BETTER IF THEY HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THOSE KINDS OF THINGS
-hANPiHEiXA_6 0 OVERALL SHORT TERM RELIEF IS BASICALLY WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT AND SO WHETHER IT IS PAIN OR FUNCTION WISE WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THINGS RETURN BACK TO A NORMAL STATE
HCaiIjW5KBk_1 0 WE ARE AT A SOLID STAIN ON A DECK
HCaiIjW5KBk_2 0 WE ARE GOING TO BE USING A BEHR PRODUCT WHICH IS RATED ABOUT NUMBER ONE AND THIS IS A SOLID STAIN TO MATCH THE DECK AND COVER UP EVERYTHING
HCaiIjW5KBk_3 0 IT WILL COVER UP IMPERFECTIONS AND JUST MAKE IT LOOK A LOT BETTER THAN TRYING TO GET IT BACK TO THE SEMI-COLOR ON IT
HCaiIjW5KBk_4 0 LIKE I SAID THIS IS A BEHR PRODUCT AND THIS IS A NEW THING THEY HAD COME OUT WHICH IS TEN YEARS ON DECKS AND 25 YEARS ON SIDING BECAUSE YOUR DECKING TAKES SUCH ABUSE FROM WALKING ON AND THE ELEMENTS AND THE SUN AND EVERYTHING TEN YEARS IS REALLY GREAT ON THIS PRODUCT AND ALSO IT IS VERY VERY THICK
HCaiIjW5KBk_5 0 I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE AS THICK AS THIS
HCaiIjW5KBk_6 0 SO IT SHOULD COVER REALLY WELL
HCaiIjW5KBk_7 0 IT SHOULD GET INTO ALL THE CRACKS IN THE WOOD BECAUSE I SPRAY IT AND PAD IT OUT AND JUST WORK IT DOWN INTO THE WOOD TO GET THE BEST FINISH POSSIBLE
HCaiIjW5KBk_8 0 THIS IS JUST A SMALL MAGNUM SEVEN AIRLESS SPRAYER
HCaiIjW5KBk_9 0 THAT IS WHAT THEY ALL USE NOWADAYS IS AIRLESS SPRAYERS SO YOU DON'T HAVE ALL KINDS OF AIR BLOWING STUFF ALL OVER THE HOUSE
HCaiIjW5KBk_10 0 AN AIRLESS SPRAYER PUMPS THE PAINT THROUGH YOUR ORIFICE AND MAKES IT OUT INTO YOUR PINE SPRAY FINISH AND YOU HAVE YOUR ADJUSTMENT ON HERE TO ADJUST YOUR PRESSURE
HCaiIjW5KBk_11 0 I ADJUST THE PRESSURE WAY DOWN TO PUT IT ON A DECK BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO THIS YOUR NOZZLE OR YOUR TIP IS ONLY GOING TO BE ABOUT SIX TO TEN INCHES OFF YOUR DECK AND YOU SPRAY IT BACK AND FORTH AND PUT YOUR PRODUCT WHEN YOU NEED IT AND THEN MY HELP COMES ALONG AND YOU PAD IT DOWN INTO THE DECK AND IT MAKES A GREAT FINISH
HbAyUeyxH7A_1 0 AMANDA CLAIRE SO BELIEVE IT OR NOT CIRCUIT BENDING IS PRETTY EASY
HbAyUeyxH7A_2 0 AND I THINK THE REASON A LOT PEOPLE DON'T DO IT IS WELL MAYBE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THINK THAT IT'S A KIND OF WEIRD THING TO DO
HbAyUeyxH7A_3 0 SO YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST A QUESTION OF TASTE
HbAyUeyxH7A_4 0 BUT IT'S REALLY EASY AND YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW A LOT ABOUT ELECTRONICS I MEAN EXCEPT FOR JUST FOR THE VERY BASICS OF CONDUCTING ELECTRICITY BETWEEN TWO PARTS THAT ARE MADE OUT OF METAL
HbAyUeyxH7A_5 0 I MEAN THAT'S REALLY KIND OF ALL YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THESE ARE LOW-VOLTAGE DEVICES
HbAyUeyxH7A_6 0 THERE IS NO RISK OF ELECTRIC SHOCK
HbAyUeyxH7A_7 0 YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY EASY TO GET IN THERE AND MESS AROUND WITH THE CIRCUIT BOARD
HbAyUeyxH7A_8 0 IF YOU GET THINGS LIKE THESE AT A THRIFT STORE THEY'RE REALLY INEXPENSIVE SO YOU'RE NOT RISKING YOU KNOW DAMAGING SOMETHING IRREVERSIBLY OR IRREPLACEABLY
HbAyUeyxH7A_9 0 AND YOU KNOW AS LONG AS YOU CAN LEARN HOW TO USE A SOLDERING IRON SAFELY AND YOU KNOW YOU LEARN HOW TO SOLDER CORRECTLY I THINK ANYONE CAN DO IT
HbAyUeyxH7A_10 0 SO I GUESS MY POINT IS IS DON'T BE SCARED OFF OR DON'T BE DETERRED FROM MAYBE TRYING TO GET INTO THIS BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ELECTRONICS
HbAyUeyxH7A_11 0 BECAUSE CIRCUIT BENDING IS VERY MUCH OF A KIND OF AN EXPLORATORY ACTIVITY WHERE YOU KINDA MAKE IT UP AS YOU GO ALONG AND IT'S PRETTY EASY TO GET GOOD RESULTS WITHOUT A WHOLE LOT OF WORK OR WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING A WHOLE ABOUT ELECTRONICS BEFORE YOU BEGIN
GZ7JnCMxujE_1 0 NOW LET'S CONSIDER THE B MAJOR VOICING 2ND INVERSION THE NOTES IN B MAJOR ARE B THE ROOT D SHARP THE 3RD F SHARP THE 5TH
GZ7JnCMxujE_2 0 SO FOR THE 2ND INVERSION WE BEGIN WITH THE 5TH OF THE CORD WHICH IS F SHARP AND WE'LL DO SO ON THE 11TH FRET OF THE 3RD STRING THAT GIVES US THE 5TH F SHARP AND THEN WE ADD B THE ROOT OF THE CORD ON THE 11TH FRET OF THE 2ND STRING AND THEN WE ADD D SHARP THE 3RD OF THE CORD ON THE 10TH FRET OF THE 1ST STRING SO THERE WE HAVE B MAJOR 2ND INVERSION ON THE 3RD STRING THIS CORD CANNOT BE PLAYED ONE OCTAVE HIGHER BECAUSE WE'RE ON THE 11TH FRET AND TO DO SO WE WOULD NEED TO MOVE UP TO THE 23RD FRET WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT ON THIS PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT BUT THIS WILL SUFFICE FOR NOW
hiHMqHo__pI_2 0 THIS TIME WE ARE IN A SUBARU STI AT PRESENT A WRXSTI
hiHMqHo__pI_3 0 THIS CAR HAS A LOT MORE POWER THAN THE AUDI TT I WAS JUST IN BUT IT IS A FOUR WHEEL DRIVE SO YOU CAN STEER RIGOROUSLY WITH IT AND YOU CAN BE VERY HARD ON THE THROTTLE AND THE CAR WILL JUST NEED TO SORT EVERYTHING OUT FOR YOU
hiHMqHo__pI_4 0 SO IT'S A GREAT CAR TO LEARN THE BALANCE OF DRIFTING WITH
hiHMqHo__pI_5 0 I LIKE THIS MORE THAN THE LANCER IT JUST FEELS BETTER TO ME
hiHMqHo__pI_6 0 OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT DIFFER SO THAT IS ONCE AGAIN PERSONAL PREFERENCE WHICH IS THE GREAT THING ABOUT DRIFTING BECAUSE A LOT OF IT IS A PERSONAL STYLE THAT COMES INTO IT
hiHMqHo__pI_7 0 SO BECAUSE THIS CAR HAS MORE POWER YOU ARE GOING TO BE COMING INTO CORNERS A LOT FASTER THAN YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN AN AUDI TT BUT SINCE IT IS FOUR WHEEL YOU CAN BE VERY RIGOROUS WITH YOUR STEERING AND VERY VIOLENT WITH YOUR INPUTS AND STILL HAVE THE CAR SLIDE VERY SMOOTHLY
hiHMqHo__pI_8 0 YOU WILL NOTICE I STILL USE THE E BRIGG TO KIND OF KICK THE BACK END OUT IF I FIND MYSELF UNDER STEERING A LITTLE BIT THROUGH THE CORNER AND THAT JUST HELPS PROLONG THE DRIFT IN THESE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE CARS AND IT IS PRETTY MUCH A TECHNIQUE I USE IN MOST ALL FOUR WHEEL DRIVE CARS THAT I DRIFT JUST AS A LITTLE SAFETY DEVICE
hiHMqHo__pI_9 0 SO YOU CAN JUST MASH ON THE THROTTLE IN THESE CARS AND THESE CARS WILL JUST HOOK UP AND GO THROUGH THE CORNER
hiHMqHo__pI_10 0 SO DON'T BE AFRAID TO BE HEAVY FOOTED IN THESE KIND OF CARS BECAUSE THE CARS DRIVE TRAIN WILL KIND OF GIVE YOU ENOUGH GRIP AND GET YOU THROUGH THE CORNER SO LET'S ATTACK THIS LONG SWEEPER RIGHT HERE
hiHMqHo__pI_11 0 WATCH YOUR ENTRY SPEED AS YOU GO IN AND YOU JUST WANT TO BE NICE AND SMOOTH WITH YOUR STEERING ON THOSE LONG AND SMOOTH CORNERS BUT ON THESE SHORT FAST CORNERS YOU CAN BE VERY VIOLENT AND JUST GET THE CAR SIDEWAYS
hiHMqHo__pI_12 0 THEY WILL JUST HOOK UP AND DRIFT BEAUTIFULLY
hiHMqHo__pI_13 0 SO LIKE OTHER FOUR WHEEL DRIVE CARS THIS IS A GREAT CAR TO THROW AROUND AND JUST STAND ON THE GAS AND ACTUALLY STANDING ON THE GAS WILL STABILIZE THE CAR AS YOU GO THROUGH
hiHMqHo__pI_14 0 SO USE A LOT OF FEINT MOTION AND JUST NOT WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THROTTLING BUT JUST STAND ON IT AND PUT THESE CARS THROUGH THE CORNER NICE AND SMOOTHLY
hiHMqHo__pI_15 0 SO YOUR STEERING INPUT IS GOING TO BE A LOT MORE VIOLENT IN THESE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE CARS THAN IT WILL BE IN AN FR CAR OR AN MR CAR SIMPLY BECAUSE THE CAR IS MORE STABLE AND IT WILL JUST GRIP AND KIND OF DRIFT YOU AROUND THE CORNER LIKE SO
hiHMqHo__pI_16 0 AND YOU CAN BE VERY VIOLENT AND GET REALLY SIDEWAYS AND THE CAR WILL STILL BE FAIRLY RECOVERABLE SO YOU CAN GET REALLY SIDEWAYS IN THESE CARS AND STILL BE ABLE TO CATCH THE DRIFT AS LONG AS YOU STAND ON THE GAS
hiHMqHo__pI_17 0 SO LET'S SAY I WERE TO NOT STAND ON THE GAS THAT WOULD ACTUALLY KILL THE DRIFT IN THESE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE CARS AND LET'S TRY AND DEMONSTRATE THAT
hiHMqHo__pI_18 0 SEE NOT STANDING ON THE GAS WILL JUST KILL THE DRIFT AND YOU'LL JUST END UP WITH TOO MUCH DRIFT
hiHMqHo__pI_19 0 SO YOU CAN GO KAMIKAZE IN THESE CARS JUST GO AHEAD AND GO ALL OUT AND USE A LOT OF FEINT MOTION AND A LOT OF THROTTLE AND YOU WILL FIND OUT THAT THESE CARS WILL SLIDE AROUND CORNERS JUST AS LONG AS YOU GIVE IT THE RIGHT MOTION
hiHMqHo__pI_20 0 SO IT IS ALL ABOUT WEIGHT SHIFTING JUST LIKE THE OTHER CARS BUT UNLIKE THE OTHER CARS YOU CAN JUST STAND ON THE GAS AND THE CAR WILL JUST KIND OF GLIDE THROUGH THE CORNERS
GFNRh1gDJnY_1 0 OKAY SO I THINK NOW THAT WE'VE GOT IT MARKED WE GOT THE BUTTONS OFF WE'RE READY TO START TAKING THESE SLEEVES APART
GFNRh1gDJnY_2 0 AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT IT'S NO BIG DEAL IT'S REAL SIMPLE TO DO
GFNRh1gDJnY_3 0 SO I THINK I TOLD YOU I WAS GOING TO DO THE PLACKET FIRST
GFNRh1gDJnY_4 0 BUT NOW THAT I LOOK AT IT I THINK I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE THE LINING OFF FIRST
GFNRh1gDJnY_5 0 SO JUST FOLD IT UP LIKE THIS MAYBE LIKE THREE INCHES UP
GFNRh1gDJnY_6 0 AND LIKE I SAID I'M GOING TO USE MY RAZOR BLADE YOU CAN USE YOUR SEAM RIPPER
GFNRh1gDJnY_7 0 AND RIGHT HERE WHERE THE PLACKET MEETS THE LINING THERE'S LIKE ONE TWO THREE PIECES OF FABRIC ALL CONJOINED RIGHT HERE JUST KIND OF PULL IT ALL APART
GFNRh1gDJnY_8 0 AND I'M GOING TO GO AND BREAK THE THREAD THAT'S ATTACHING THE LINING TO THE TOP PART OF THE PLACKET JUST RIGHT THERE UNDERNEATH
GFNRh1gDJnY_9 0 SO NOW THAT I HAVE IT STARTED I CAN JUST HOLD IT PULL IT AWAY AND JUST BREAK THE THREADS ALL THE WAY AROUND
GFNRh1gDJnY_10 0 YOU CAN SEE WHY USING A RAZOR BLADE IS SO EASY IT JUST POPS THE THREAD INSTEAD OF YOU SAWING AT THE THREAD TRYING TO GET IT APART
GFNRh1gDJnY_12 0 OH AND USUALLY IT'S SEWN A LOT RIGHT HERE RIGHT AROUND THIS SEAM BUT YOU JUST BREAK THOSE THREADS
GFNRh1gDJnY_13 0 HERE WE GO
GFNRh1gDJnY_14 0 AND FLIP IT AROUND AND FINISH THIS LAST LITTLE BIT THEN WE'LL HAVE THAT LINING OFF
GFNRh1gDJnY_15 0 AND I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO NEXT IS I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO TAKE THIS APART THEN WE'LL START WORKING ON TAKING THE PLACKET APART ITSELF
GFNRh1gDJnY_16 0 SO WE'LL DO THAT NEXT

_g52En9GhQo_10 0 THEY WON'T REALLY MATTER IF YOU PUT THE EYES WITH THE BAGS LIKE THAT
_g52En9GhQo_11 0 IN FACT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE HIM LOOK STUNNED OR LIKE YOU KNOW JUST LIKE HE'S LIKE INSOMNIA HAS TAKEN OVER
_g52En9GhQo_12 0 YOU CAN DRAW NO LIDS AT ALL AND HE'LL STILL LOOK EXHAUSTED
_g52En9GhQo_13 0 DRAW THE PUPILS SLIGHTLY HANGING UNDER THE EYES THERE
_g52En9GhQo_14 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE REST OF HIS FACE TO JUST KIND OF JUST SHOW WE'LL THAT THE THING ABOUT TIRED PEOPLE
_g52En9GhQo_15 0 THEY MAKE THEIR EYEBROWS LOOK KIND OF JAGGED LIKE THAT
_g52En9GhQo_16 0 COME IN HERE AND DRAW HIS NOSE AND THEN MAYBE DRAW HIS MOUTH KIND OF HANGING LOW

_g52En9GhQo_18 0 DRAW HIS FACE ALL SLACK
_g52En9GhQo_19 0 COME IN HERE AND DRAW HIS EARS

G7CROWWKnsc_1 0 I WANT TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THINGS THAT I'M GOING TO ADVICE YOU NOT TO DO OKAY
G7CROWWKnsc_2 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO STUDY CALLIGRAPHY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD NOT DO IS COMPETE WITH TYPE
G7CROWWKnsc_3 0 IN OTHER WORDS YOU DON'T WANT TO END UP WITH LETTERS THAT LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE TYPE THAT YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST USE TYPE
G7CROWWKnsc_4 0 YOU WANT YOUR LETTERS TO LOOK LIKE THEY'RE ALIVE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT TYPE JUST CAN'T DO
G7CROWWKnsc_5 0 IT'S GOT TO COME OUT OF YOUR HAND SO IT'S GOING TO BE POSSIBLY SLIGHTLY IMPERFECT
G7CROWWKnsc_6 0 BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO LOOK LIKE A CONSCIOUSNESS PUT IT DOWN THERE
G7CROWWKnsc_7 0 YOU ALSO NEED TO KNOW YOURSELF WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW WHEN YOU'RE STARTING TO LOSE CONCENTRATION SO YOU SHOULD STOP BEFORE YOU LOSE CONCENTRATION
G7CROWWKnsc_8 0 THERE'S ANOTHER KIND OF STOP THAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHICH I THINK IS LIKE SERIOUSLY IMPORTANT OKAY
G7CROWWKnsc_9 0 I KNOW THERE ARE CYBERTRONS OUT THERE WHO HAVE THIS TENDENCY TO THINK IN TERMS OF OH THAT'S INTERESTING HOW CAN I DO THAT ON THE COMPUTER
G7CROWWKnsc_10 0 THIS IS NOT ABOUT HOW YOU CAN DO THIS ON THE COMPUTER
G7CROWWKnsc_11 0 THIS IS GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
G7CROWWKnsc_12 0 IF YOU START IF YOU START THINKING THAT WAY YOU GOT TO PICK UP THE PEN AND DO IT OKAY
G7CROWWKnsc_13 0 IF YOU KEEP THINKING IN TERMS OF HOW CAN I DO THIS ON THE COMPUTER
G7CROWWKnsc_14 0 TO MY MIND IT'S A LOT LIKE YOU PUT A DVD AND THAT YOU WANT TO WATCH AND THEN YOU FAST FORWARD TO THE END OKAY
G7CROWWKnsc_15 0 YOU'VE JUST LOST EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN THAT GIVES IT VALUE AND GIVES IT MEANING
G7CROWWKnsc_16 0 SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING
G7CROWWKnsc_17 0 DON'T FALL INTO WHAT THE BUDDHIST CALL END-SEEKING
G7CROWWKnsc_18 0 AND THEN THE LAST THING IS I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT YOU TRY TO DO CALLIGRAPHY WHILE LISTENING TO MUSIC
G7CROWWKnsc_19 0 IT MAY WORK FOR YOU BUT IT DOESN'T FOR ME
G7CROWWKnsc_20 0 A MINDFULNESS SPELL HOWEVER WORKS GREAT AND YOU CAN GET ONE OF THOSE ON THE INTERNET
gxh3WUQVdy8_1 0 HI I'M MARK EMILEY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gxh3WUQVdy8_2 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE ARE GOING TO GO OVER THE RECIPE THAT WE ARE GOING TO USE FOR OUR BREW SESSION TODAY
gxh3WUQVdy8_3 0 FOR ALL OF MY RECIPES I WILL BE USING LIQUID MALT EXTRACT INSTEAD OF DRY MALT EXTRACT
gxh3WUQVdy8_4 0 IF YOU'D LIKE TO USE DRY MALT EXTRACT YOU CAN USE TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT LESS
gxh3WUQVdy8_5 0 I WILL ALSO BE USING WHOLE HOPS INSTEAD OF PELLET HOPS
gxh3WUQVdy8_6 0 IF YOU'D LIKE TO USE PELLET HOPS YOU CAN ALSO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF HOPS YOU ARE USING BY TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT
gxh3WUQVdy8_7 0 FINALLY ALL OF OUR BOILS WILL BE GOING FOR SIXTY MINUTES
gxh3WUQVdy8_8 0 BEFORE I GIVE YOU THE RECIPE TAKE A SECOND GO GRAB A PIECE OF PAPER AND A PENCIL AND GET READY TO WRITE DOWN THE INGREDIENT FOR THE AMOUNT THAT YOU ARE GOING TO NEED
gxh3WUQVdy8_9 0 FOR OUR CREAM ALE RECIPE WE ARE GOING TO GO WITH NICE AND A LIGHT OF A BEER THAT WE CAN GET
gxh3WUQVdy8_10 0 TO DO THIS WE ARE GOING TO USE SEVEN POUNDS OF PILSNER MALT EXTRACT OR IF YOU CAN NOT GET THAT USE THE LIGHTEST MALT EXTRACT THAT YOU CAN THAT IS LIQUID MALT EXTRACT
gxh3WUQVdy8_11 0 THEN FOR SPECIALTY GRAINS WE ARE GOING TO ADD IN ONE POUND OF FLAKE MAIZE OR CORN TO GIVE IT THAT FERMETABLES
gxh3WUQVdy8_12 0 KEEP IT RELATIVELY CLEAN JUST TO HAVE A HINT OF CORN TO IT AND TO HELP COVERT THAT WE ARE GOING TO ADD IN A HALF POUND OF PILASTER MALT
gxh3WUQVdy8_13 0 I'M TALKING ABOUT THE GRAINS HERE NOT THE MALT EXTRACT
gxh3WUQVdy8_14 0 FOR HOPS WE ARE GOING TO ADD IN 1.25 OUNCES OF CRYSTAL HOPS AT 3.6 PERCENT ALPHA ACID FOR SIXTY MINUTES
gxh3WUQVdy8_15 0 THEN RIGHT AS WE TURN OFF THE BOIL WE ARE GOING TO ADD IN ANOTHER HALF OUNCE OF CRYSTAL TO GIVE IT THAT NICE KIND OF NOBLISH HYPE AROMA
gxh3WUQVdy8_16 0 WITH FIFTEEN MINUTES LEFT IN THE BOIL WE ARE GOING TO ADD IN A HALF A TEASPOON OF IRISH MOSS ALPHA PROTEIN COAGULATION
gxh3WUQVdy8_17 0 FOR OUR YEAST I RECOMMEND THIS FERMENTATIONS
gxh3WUQVdy8_18 0 WE ARE GOING TO USE FERMENTATION ALLSOPP 05 TO PROVIDE A NICE CLEAN PROFILE
GRo-h1ydCo4_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM MY NAME IS STAN AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT COMMUNITY THEATER AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT YOUR PROPS AND COSTUMES AND HOW TO STORE THEM AND YOU MAKEUP AS WELL
GRo-h1ydCo4_2 0 THE BIG PROBLEM WITH PROPS MAKEUP AND COSTUMES IS KEEPING THEM ORGANIZED KEEPING AN INVENTORY OF THEM AND STORING THEM
GRo-h1ydCo4_3 0 ESPECIALLY THE COSTUMES AND THE PROPS GET TO BE QUITE A STORAGE PROBLEM
GRo-h1ydCo4_4 0 ONE THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TRY TO BORROW THINGS THAT YOU CAN RETURN OR BUY CHEAP THINGS FROM THRIFT SHOPS AND REDONATE THEM TO THRIFT SHOPS SO THAT YOU DON'T BUILD UP A HUGE INVENTORY OF THINGS
GRo-h1ydCo4_5 0 EVERY PLAY HAS SOME COSTUMES AND PROPS THAT ARE PRETTY STANDARD BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME UNIQUE THING THAT YOU'LL PROBABLY WON'T NEED AGAIN FOR YEARS
GRo-h1ydCo4_6 0 WHY TAKE UP SPACE TRYING TO STORE THEM
GRo-h1ydCo4_7 0 IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY IN CHARGE OF EACH OF THOSE FUNCTIONS THEY CAN BE IN CHARGE OF KEEPING THESE THINGS ORGANIZED IN INVENTORY AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
GRo-h1ydCo4_8 0 SOMETIMES YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF GOING OUT AND BUYING A PROP AND YOU'LL FIND OUT YOU ALREADY HAD IT IN STORAGE BUT NOBODY REALIZED IT WAS THERE
GRo-h1ydCo4_9 0 HAVING A LIST OF THOSE OR HAVING THEM ON A COMPUTER DATABASE IS REALLY A HANDY THING IF YOU CAN GET ORGANIZED ENOUGH TO DO THAT
GRo-h1ydCo4_10 0 WE FIND THESE PLASTIC DRAW CABINETS TO BE VERY HANDY FOR STORING THINGS
GRo-h1ydCo4_11 0 PARTICULARLY MAKEUP AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT REALLY SHOULDN'T BE LEFT OUT WHERE IT CAN GET DUSTY AND THAT SORT OF THING
GRo-h1ydCo4_12 0 THESE ORGANIZING THINGS THAT YOU CAN GET AT ANY DISCOUNT STORE ARE VERY HANDY WAYS OF STORING THINGS
GRo-h1ydCo4_13 0 COSTUMES TYPICALLY WE HAVE HANGING UP ON RACKS AND COVERED WITH PLASTIC TO KEEP THE DUST OFF OF THEM BUT WE DON'T STORE ANY COSTUMES HERE
GRo-h1ydCo4_14 0 WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO AT VERDE VALLEY THEATER WAS WORKOUT A COOPERATIVE ARRANGEMENT WITH ONE OF THE LOCAL SCHOOLS THAT HAS A DRAMA DEPARTMENT
GRo-h1ydCo4_15 0 THEY STORE ALL OF OUR COSTUMES AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO US WHENEVER WE NEED THEM OR WANT TO USE THEM AND THE SCHOOL ALSO HAS THE USE
GRo-h1ydCo4_16 0 THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE THEY GET MORE USE THAT WAY
GRo-h1ydCo4_17 0 WE DON'T HAVE TO STORE THEM AND THAT'S A BIG BENEFIT TO US
GRo-h1ydCo4_18 0 LIKE MOST THEATERS WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF STORAGE SPACE
GRo-h1ydCo4_19 0 EVEN WITH THE NEW THEATER BUILDING THAT'S BEING DONATED TO US WE STILL WON'T HAVE ENOUGH STORAGE SPACE TO KEEP A LARGE INVENTORY OF COSTUMES
GRo-h1ydCo4_20 0 IF YOU CAN WORKOUT A COOPERATIVE ARRANGEMENT WITH ANOTHER ORGANIZATION THAT HAS STORAGE SPACE THAT'S A REAL BENEFIT FOR YOU
Gmr0ojPiEXo_1 0 CLANCY ROSE ALRIGHTY AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE MACHINE AND EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR THE MACHINE TO BE READY TO PREPARE ESPRESSO
Gmr0ojPiEXo_2 0 ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS IS WELL TURN YOUR MACHINE ON AND LET IT WARM UP AND LET IT GET UP TO THE TEMPERATURE OPERATING TEMPERATURE
Gmr0ojPiEXo_3 0 ONE OF THE NEXT THINGS THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT EASY STEP TO MISS IS FILLING UP THE WATER TANK WHICH ON THIS MACHINE IS UNDER THIS UNDER THIS PLATE RIGHT HERE IN THE BACK OF THE MACHINE
Gmr0ojPiEXo_4 0 A LOT OF MACHINES THAT DO NOT HAVE AN AUTOMATIC SHUT OFF WHERE IT SHUTS OFF IF THE WATER TANK IS EMPTY IF IT DOES NOT HAVE THAT FEATURE WHICH THIS ONE DOES THEN IT CAN MESS UP THE ESPRESSO MACHINE A WHOLE LOT IF YOU ARE TRYING TO BREW COFFEE AND THAT IS EMPTY
Gmr0ojPiEXo_5 0 YOU HAVE YOUR ESPRESSO MACHINE ALL WARMED UP
Gmr0ojPiEXo_6 0 YOU CAN MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS FLOWING RIGHT OUT OF THE STEAM WAND BY JUST KIND OF PURGING THAT INTO A TOWEL
Gmr0ojPiEXo_7 0 YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO BE CAREFUL AND WRAP THE TOWEL AROUND IT LIKE I JUST DID SO YOU DO NOT BURN YOURSELF MAYBE FLOW A LITTLE WATER THROUGH THE PORTER FILTER IN THE GROUP HEAD
Gmr0ojPiEXo_8 0 THAT IS ALSO GOING TO WARM UP THE PORTER FILTER
Gmr0ojPiEXo_9 0 AND YOU ARE READY TO GO
GddcwkKELd4_1 0 HI THIS IS JOHN MICHAELS WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
GddcwkKELd4_2 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT BUYING A NEW CAR
GddcwkKELd4_3 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT CREDIT WORTHINESS
GddcwkKELd4_4 0 LISTEN IF YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE BEST CREDIT IN THE WORLD ITS OK DON'T BE AFRAID THINKING THAT YOU CAN'T BUY A NEW CAR
GddcwkKELd4_5 0 THERE ARE MANY MANY CAR MANUFACTURERS OUT THERE THAT ARE A LOT MORE LENIENT THAN YOU MIGHT THING
GddcwkKELd4_6 0 FOR EXAMPLE FORD MOTOR CREDIT IS ONE OF THE MOST LENIENT FINANCING COMPANIES AVAILABLE TODAY
GddcwkKELd4_7 0 SO EVEN IF YOU HAVE A LOW CREDIT SCORE THEY CAN STILL FINANCE YOU A NEW CAR
GddcwkKELd4_8 0 SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER THAN OTHER MANUFACTURERS
GddcwkKELd4_9 0 SO DO YOUR HOMEWORK WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCING AND WHEN IT COMES TO LEASING AND WHEN IT COMES TO JUST THE OVERALL CREDIT WORTHINESS OF WHAT YOU THINK YOU CAN BUY CAUSE YOU MAY BE DRIVING IN A CAR AS OPPOSED TO NOT DRIVING IN A CAR IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE RIGHT PRODUCT LINE
GddcwkKELd4_10 0 SO REMEMBER SOME PRODUCT LINES WILL ALLOW YOU TO FINANCE A CAR AND ACTUALLY ACHIEVE A LOAN FOR YOU THAN OTHERS
GddcwkKELd4_11 0 JUST GO OUT AND FIND THE ONE THAT SUITS YOUR CREDIT NEEDS AND COMPATIBILITY
gbYt1ZlN5Xw_1 0 ALRIGHT TODAY WE'RE GOING TO FURTHER SHOW YOU HOW TO MULCH IN YOUR LETTUCE
gbYt1ZlN5Xw_2 0 NOW HERE'S A MATURE LETTUCE BED THAT I'VE THINNED OUT
gbYt1ZlN5Xw_3 0 AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE HAVE INDIVIDUAL PLANTS AND PULL OUT SOME THESE WEEDS WE ALWAYS HAVE WEEDS
gbYt1ZlN5Xw_4 0 NEVER LACKING IN WEEDS
gbYt1ZlN5Xw_5 0 AND WHAT I DID IS WE HAVE A LOT OF PINE TREES AROUND HERE SO WE'VE RAKED UP THE PINE NEEDLES
gbYt1ZlN5Xw_6 0 PINE NEEDLES MAKE A GREAT MULCH THEY TAKE A LONG TIME TO BREAK DOWN BUT WHEN THEY DO BREAK DOWN THEY PUT LOTS OF NUTRIENTS IN THE GROUND
gbYt1ZlN5Xw_7 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO THIS MULCH HELPS KEEP THE WEEDS DOWN AS THE SEASON GOES ALONG
gbYt1ZlN5Xw_8 0 SO WE TAKE THE MULCH AND WE PUT IT IN AND AROUND THE LETTUCE PLANTS
gbYt1ZlN5Xw_9 0 THIS KEEPS THE GROUND NICE AND MOIST IN DRY TIMES KEEPS THE WEEDS DOWN SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO WORK SO HARD IN KEEPING THE GARDEN GOOD AND FRESH PROTECTED
gbYt1ZlN5Xw_10 0 ONCE YOU MULCH IT IN THEN WE WILL WANT TO COVER IT BACK UP TO KEEP THE RABBITS AND BUNNIES OUT OF COURSE
gbYt1ZlN5Xw_11 0 AND THERE WE GO
H6WIfzbz2SU_1 0 IN THIS SERIES I'LL BE DISCUSSING THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARDS IN MAGIC THE GATHERING
H6WIfzbz2SU_2 0 CARDS ALL FALL UNDER TWO CATEGORIES LAND OR SPELLS
H6WIfzbz2SU_3 0 ANYTHING THAT'S NOT A LAND IS AT SOME POINT A SPELL EVEN IF IT BECOMES SOMETHING ELSE AFTERWARD
H6WIfzbz2SU_4 0 THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARDS ARE LAND CREATURE ARTIFACT ENCHANTMENT SORCERY INSTANT TRIBAL AND PLAINS WALKER
H6WIfzbz2SU_5 0 CARDS CAN ALSO HAVE SUBTYPES AND SUPER TYPES
H6WIfzbz2SU_6 0 SUBTYPES COME AFTER THE TYPE SUPER TYPES COME BEFORE THE TYPE
H6WIfzbz2SU_7 0 EVERY CARD HAS AT LEAST ONE TYPE AND MANY CARDS HAVE MORE THAN ONE SUCH AS ARTIFACT CREATURES AND TRIBAL CARDS
H6WIfzbz2SU_8 0 THE WAY THAT IT'S ORGANIZED IS THAT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE PICTURE AND THE TEXT BOX IS WHAT'S CALLED THE TYPE LINE
H6WIfzbz2SU_9 0 THIS SAYS BASIC LAND FOREST AND IS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST CARDS IN TERMS OF TYPE
H6WIfzbz2SU_10 0 ALSO IN THE TYPE LINE IS THE EXPANSION SET THAT INDICATES ITS RARITY
gGGPUNrOZsk_1 0 HERE WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE TWO EXAMPLES OF TWO DIFFERENT TYPES THAT INTERSECT
gGGPUNrOZsk_2 0 THERE ARE MANY CREATURES IN THE GAME WHICH ARE BOTH ARTIFACTS AND CREATURES
gGGPUNrOZsk_3 0 THIS REPRESENTS THE IDEA OF ROBOTS AND OTHER WAR MACHINES AND SIEGE ENGINES
gGGPUNrOZsk_4 0 THIS IS THE EXTRUDER AND THIS IS A GOBLIN WAR WAGON
gGGPUNrOZsk_5 0 THEY BOTH SAY ARTIFACT CREATURE ON THEIR TYPE AND THEY BOTH HAVE POWER AND TOUGHNESS IN THE LOWER RIGHT HAND CORNER
gGGPUNrOZsk_6 0 THAT MEANS THAT THESE CARDS CAN BE AFFECTED EITHER BY THINGS THAT AFFECT ARTIFACTS DESTROY TARGET ARTIFACT OR ENCHANTMENT SUCH AS DISENCHANT
gGGPUNrOZsk_7 0 OR SOMETHING THAT SAYS TARGET CREATURE GETS MINUS THREE MINUS THREE UNTIL END OF TURN
gGGPUNrOZsk_8 0 EITHER ICKER SLICK OR DISENCHANT COULD KILL EITHER OF THESE CARDS BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH ARTIFACTS FOR DISENCHANT AND THEY BOTH HAVE THREE TOUGHNESS FOR ICKER SLICK
gGGPUNrOZsk_9 0 THESE CARDS HAVE ADVANTAGES IN THAT THEY'RE COLORLESS AND CAN BE PLAYED IN ANY DECK FOR THE COST OF FOUR MANNA EACH IN ANY COLOR
gGGPUNrOZsk_10 0 BUT THEY ALSO HAVE DISADVANTAGES OF BEING SUSCEPTIBLE TO A WIDER RANGE OF CARDS
gIp8qya-Zos_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO HAVE YOUR DOG SIT AND WAIT
gIp8qya-Zos_2 0 THIS IS A GREAT EXERCISE TO USE AT DOORWAYS TO ENSURE THE DOG IS NOT DARTING OUTSIDE
gIp8qya-Zos_3 0 IT ALSO IS NICE TO KEEP THEM POLITE WHEN COMPANY COMES TO THE DOOR OR ANY TIME THAT YOU JUST NEED TO STEP AWAY AND YOU WANT THE DOG TO REMAIN BEHIND
gIp8qya-Zos_4 0 WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE SIT POSITION SIT SEE IF SHE'LL DO IT ON COMMAND
gIp8qya-Zos_5 0 AGAIN THIS IS THE PLACEMENT
gIp8qya-Zos_7 0 WHEN I DIP THIS HAND COMMAND IT'S JUST LIKE HAVING A STOP TO THE DOG'S NOSE
gIp8qya-Zos_8 0 THEN I'M GOING TO STEP OFF ON MY RIGHT FOOT RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE DOG STEPPING AWAY AND THEN RETURNING TO THE DOG
gIp8qya-Zos_9 0 THAT'S THE WHOLE COMMAND
gIp8qya-Zos_10 0 ONCE I WALK SHE CAN GET UP
gIp8qya-Zos_11 0 SHE DID GET UP A LITTLE EARLY SO I'M GOING TO PLACE HER BACK INTO THE SIT
gIp8qya-Zos_12 0 WAIT STEPPING IN FRONT STEPPING BACK AND THEN SHE CAN GO FORWARD
gIp8qya-Zos_13 0 IT'S A GREAT WAY TO ENSURE THAT YOUR DOG IS NOT TRIPPING YOU AT THE DOOR OR THAT THEY ARE STAYING SAFE IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY MAY NOT BE COMFORTABLE
gIp8qya-Zos_14 0 SO PRACTICE THAT WHENEVER YOU GO OUT THE DOORWAY
gT35PHYO7rE_1 0 HEY MY NAME IS ADDISON FROM CAPTAIN BILLS AND I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO RUN BASIC VOLLEYBALL DRILLS
gT35PHYO7rE_2 0 THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT DRILLS YOU CAN USE TO PLAY OR TO PRACTICE VOLLEYBALL
gT35PHYO7rE_3 0 THERE ARE SERVING DRILLS PASSING DRILLS HITTING DRILLS AND SETTING DRILLS
gT35PHYO7rE_4 0 FIRST ONE SERVING DRILLS
gT35PHYO7rE_5 0 PROBABLY THE MOST KEY THING IN SERVING IS REPETITION OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO YOU CAN GET YOUR SERVE CONSISTENT
gT35PHYO7rE_6 0 SO WHEN SERVING WHAT YOU WANT TO IS YOU WANT TO HAVE A BASKET OF BALLS TAKE THE BALL OUT IN FRONT OF YOU TOSS IT UP IN FRONT OF YOU HIGH ENOUGH SO YOU HAVE TIME TO GET TO IT AND HIT IT WITH YOUR HAND
gT35PHYO7rE_7 0 YOUR HAND WANTS TO BE OPEN NEEDS TO BE OPEN AND YOU WANT TO HIT IT WITH THE PALM OF YOUR HAND
gT35PHYO7rE_8 0 SO WHEN YOU HIT IT TOSS THE BALL IN FRONT OF YOU TAKE YOUR ARM BACK LEAD WITH YOUR ELBOW AND HIT WITH YOUR HAND OPEN AND OUT IN FRONT OF YOU
gT35PHYO7rE_9 0 PASSING DRILLS YOU WOULD NEED A TOSSER AND A PASSER AND A TARGET
gT35PHYO7rE_10 0 SO THE TOSSER WOULD TOSS THE BALL TO THE PASSER THE PASSER WANTS TO GET BEHIND THE BALL FACE THEIR TARGET USE THEIR KNEES GET THEIR BUTT DOWN
gT35PHYO7rE_11 0 USE YOUR PLATFORM PUT YOUR ARMS ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER FOLD THEM TOGETHER TO BUILD YOUR PLATFORM
gT35PHYO7rE_12 0 WHEN PASSING THE BALL YOU WANT TO HIT IT BETWEEN YOUR WRISTS AND YOUR ELBOW
gT35PHYO7rE_13 0 WHEN PASSING THE TOSSER IS GOING TO PASS IT TO THE TOSS IT TO THE PASSER AND THEN THE PASSER WILL USE THEIR LEGS TO KEEP THEIR BUTT DOWN FACE THEIR TARGET TO TRY TO GET INTO THE TARGET
gT35PHYO7rE_14 0 REPETITION IS ALSO VERY EFFECTIVE IN PASSING DRILLS BECAUSE PASSING IS THE BACKBONE OF VOLLEYBALL
gT35PHYO7rE_15 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE VERY A VERY CONSISTENT PASSER AND YOU WILL SUCCEED IN VOLLEYBALL
gT35PHYO7rE_16 0 HITTING DRILLS YOU HAVE A SETTER WHO WILL SET THE BALL TO THE HITTER
gT35PHYO7rE_17 0 NOW HITTING WHEN YOU ARE HITTING YOU WANT TO TAKE A TWO STEP APPROACH
gT35PHYO7rE_18 0 SO WHEN YOU DEPENDING ON WHAT IF YOU ARE LEFT HANDED OR RIGHT HANDED YOU ARE GOING TO STEP WITH THE OPPOSITE FOOT
gT35PHYO7rE_19 0 SO I'M RIGHT HANDED SO I'M GOING TO STEP FIRST WITH MY RIGHT FOOT SO I TAKE A TWO STEP APPROACH RIGHT LEFT BEND DOWN PUT MY HANDS BEHIND ME PALMS FACING UP AND THEN ONCE I'M DOWN BRING MY HANDS UP TO BRING ME UP HIGHER ABOVE THE GROUND AND THEN I'M GOING TO DROP MY ELBOW LEAD WITH MY LEFT ARM AND SWING THROUGH THE BALL
gT35PHYO7rE_20 0 SO THE SETTER IS GOING TO SET YOU THE BALL YOU TAKE YOUR APPROACH JUMP UP AND HIT IT OVER THE NET
gT35PHYO7rE_21 0 THE NEXT DRILL IS SETTING DRILLS
gT35PHYO7rE_22 0 SETTING YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU USE ALL FIVE OF YOUR FINGERS YOU WANT YOUR FINGERS TO BE VERY VERY RELAXED
gT35PHYO7rE_23 0 SO WHEN YOU ARE SETTING THE BALL YOU WANT TO TAKE THE BALL AND SHAPE YOUR HANDS IN THE SHAPE OF A BALL
gT35PHYO7rE_24 0 SO WHEN YOU ARE SETTING THE BALL TAKE THE BALL ABOVE YOUR HEAD WHERE IF YOU MISS THE BALL IT WILL HIT YOU IN YOUR FOREHEAD
gT35PHYO7rE_25 0 SO YOU TAKE THE BALL AND SET AND IT CAN NOT STAY IN YOUR HANDS VERY LONG SO YOU WANT TO GET IT OUT ALMOST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
gT35PHYO7rE_26 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR HANDS TOUCH THE BALL AT THE EXACT SAME TIME
gT35PHYO7rE_27 0 IF THEY DO NOT TOUCH AT THE EXACT SAME TIME THAT IS AN ILLEGAL HIT CALLED A DOUBLE HIT
gT35PHYO7rE_28 0 SO IF MY HANDS DON'T HIT THE BALL AT THE EXACT SAME TIME IT'S AN ILLEGAL HIT
gT35PHYO7rE_29 0 SO A SETTING DRILLS YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A TOSSER WHO WILL TOSS YOU THE BALL AND YOU GET UNDER IT YOU USE YOUR LEGS FACE YOUR TARGET AND YOU WANT TO PUSH THE BALL OUT WITH YOUR NOT ONLY YOUR WRISTS BUT YOUR LEGS ALSO AND FACE YOUR TARGET AND TRY TO GET IT IN THE TARGET
gT35PHYO7rE_30 0 ALL OF THESE DRILLS ARE NEED TO HAVE REPETITION
gT35PHYO7rE_31 0 EACH DRILL YOU NEED TO WORK ON DAILY TO BE CONSISTENT AND TO SUCCEED IN VOLLEYBALL
gT35PHYO7rE_32 0 AND THAT IS HOW YOU RUN BASIC VOLLEYBALL DRILLS
hcNnmqL5xUY_1 0 LORIN PARKER AND I'M TALKING ABOUT CIRCUIT BENDING
hcNnmqL5xUY_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE CIRCUIT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON
hcNnmqL5xUY_3 0 AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THE EXCITING PART FOR ME WHICH IS ACTUALLY TAKING THIS CIRCUIT THAT MAKES SOUNDS AND MAKING A TACTILE INTERFACE
hcNnmqL5xUY_4 0 HERE I HAVE A KNOB WHICH IS CALLED IN ELECTRONICS LAND THE POTENTIOMETER
hcNnmqL5xUY_5 0 YOU CAN BUY THESE ONLINE FROM ELECTRONIC SUPPLIERS OR FROM YOUR LOCAL ELECTRONICS NERDWARE STORE
hcNnmqL5xUY_6 0 AND BASICALLY IT'S JUST A KNOB
hcNnmqL5xUY_7 0 YOU CAN EVEN TAKE THESE OUT OF ALL THE ELECTRONICS THAT HAVE KNOBS ON THEM
hcNnmqL5xUY_8 0 THIS ONE IS A TWO MEGAOHM
hcNnmqL5xUY_9 0 YOU CAN SEE HERE YOU'RE PROBABLY IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE EVEN FOR ME HERE BUT IT SAYS TWO MEG
hcNnmqL5xUY_10 0 AND THIS IS WHERE I RECOMMEND STARTING WITH THESE
hcNnmqL5xUY_11 0 ALL ELECTRONICS ON THE INTERNET HAS TWO MEG POTS AS WE CALL THEM FOR VERY LITTLE MONEY
hcNnmqL5xUY_12 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I FOUND THIS NEAT POINT WHEN I WAS TOUCHING EARLIER WHERE THE RESISTIVITY OF MY FINGER WAS CREATING A LITTLE BIT OF A PITCH BEND IN THIS CIRCUIT
hcNnmqL5xUY_13 0 AND SO NOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NOW THAT I'VE HOOKED THESE WIRES UP I'M GOING TO TRY ALLIGATOR CLIPPING THESE WIRES FROM THOSE POINTS FROM THE BEND POINT RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT HERE
hcNnmqL5xUY_14 0 AND THEN I CONNECT THEM UP TO TWO POINTS ON THIS POTENTIOMETER
hcNnmqL5xUY_15 0 AND A POTENTIOMETER HAS SOME WIRES ON IT
hcNnmqL5xUY_16 0 I'M NOT GOING TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW
hcNnmqL5xUY_17 0 I AM JUST ALLIGATOR CLIPPING AND YOU REALLY ONLY NEED TWO POINTS ON THE POTENTIOMETER
hcNnmqL5xUY_18 0 IF I CLIPPED IT TO THIS SIDE AND TO THE MIDDLE THEN THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WOULD BE THAT I WOULD TURN IT THE OTHER WAY THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO GET THE DESIRED EFFECT
hcNnmqL5xUY_19 0 SO YOU JUST CLIP IT TO ONE POINT ON THIS SIDE AND ONE ON THE MIDDLE AND LET'S FIRE IT UP
hcNnmqL5xUY_20 0 SO NOW IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING NORMALLY BUT I'M GOING TO TURN THIS CONTROL AND WE GET SO THAT ONE'S A GOOD ONE
hcNnmqL5xUY_21 0 THEN THE OTHER ONE THAT I FOUND I'M GOING TO DISCONNECT THESE ALLIGATOR CLIPS WAS THAT GLITCH POINT AND THESE ARE REALLY EXCITING
hcNnmqL5xUY_22 0 AND I FOUND THAT THIS ONE'S PROBABLY THE BEST BUT ALL I HAVE TO DO IS TOUCH THESE WIRES NOW
hcNnmqL5xUY_23 0 AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IS MY BODY BECOMES A PART OF THE CIRCUIT OR I TOUCH THEM TOGETHER AND IT CHANGES THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THERE
hcNnmqL5xUY_24 0 SO I'VE CREATED A KNOB CONTROL AND A BODY CONTACT THAT I CAN TOUCH AND NOW I HAVE A WAY OF ACTUALLY PLAYING THIS ELECTRONIC MUSICAL INSTRUMENT
h8k0XzYoF_s_2 0 MY NAME IS MATT
h8k0XzYoF_s_3 0 I'M SPEAKING TO YOU ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
h8k0XzYoF_s_4 0 WE KIND OF BRIEFLY TOUCHED ON LETTERING EARLIER

h8k0XzYoF_s_7 0 YOU CAN ADD SOME COOL ACTION WORDS LIKE YOU MIGHT SEE IN A BATMAN COMIC OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
h8k0XzYoF_s_8 0 I'M GOING TO RESIZE THAT
h8k0XzYoF_s_9 0 IN ORDER TO DO THIS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HOLD DOWN THE SHIFT BUTTON WHEN YOU CLICK AND DRAG ONE OF THESE LITTLE BLUE DOTS
h8k0XzYoF_s_10 0 I'LL SHOW YOU HERE
h8k0XzYoF_s_11 0 IF YOU JUST CLICK ON ONE WITHOUT HOLDING DOWN SHIFT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DISTORT YOUR LETTERS THERE
h8k0XzYoF_s_12 0 YOU CAN CREATE SOME PRETTY COOL EFFECTS LIKE THIS
h8k0XzYoF_s_13 0 IF YOU WANT TO RESIZE THE ENTIRE THING YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HOLD DOWN SHIFT

Ge7uaPsauLI_1 0 OKAY SO WE'RE MAKING A BOTTLE NECK VASE
Ge7uaPsauLI_2 0 AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO NOW IS SECURE THE PIECE OF CLAY THAT WE'VE WEDGED ONTO THE BAT
Ge7uaPsauLI_3 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO JUST KIND OF SET IT DOWN ON THE WHEEL AND LOOK TO SEE HOW CENTERED IT IS MAYBE EVEN TURN THE WHEEL
Ge7uaPsauLI_4 0 SO I'M GOING TO PUT MY HANDS ON EITHER SIDE OF IT THEY'RE ON MY KNEES
Ge7uaPsauLI_5 0 AND I'M JUST GOING TO LIFT UP MY ARM AND SMACK IT DOWN ON THE WHEEL
Ge7uaPsauLI_6 0 THERE WE GO
Ge7uaPsauLI_7 0 NOW IT'S NICE AND SECURE
Ge7uaPsauLI_8 0 NOW I'M READY TO START CENTERING
Ge7uaPsauLI_9 0 I'M GOING TO GET THE CLAY NICE AND WET SO THAT IT DOESN'T SO THAT THERE'S NOT FRICTION WITH MY HANDS
Ge7uaPsauLI_10 0 AND I'M GOING TO PUSH THE CLAY DOWN ONTO THE WHEEL
Ge7uaPsauLI_11 0 AND I LIKE TO DO THIS FIRST JUST TO MAKE SURE WE'RE SECURE
Ge7uaPsauLI_12 0 ONCE AGAIN YOU DON'T WANT THAT CLAY FLYING OFF THE WHEEL
Ge7uaPsauLI_13 0 NOW THE PROCESS OF CENTERING IS A PROCESS OF DRAWING THE CLAY UP BETWEEN YOUR HANDS AND THEN PUSHING IT BACK DOWN
Ge7uaPsauLI_14 0 AND THIS CENTERS THE ENTIRE LUMP OF CLAY
Ge7uaPsauLI_15 0 AS YOU CAN SEE WE ALMOST HAVE IT RIGHT THERE
Ge7uaPsauLI_16 0 HOWEVER EVEN IF YOU GET THE PIECE OF CLAY ON CENTER STRAIGHT AWAY YOU WANT TO DO THIS A FEW TIMES SO THAT THE ENTIRE LUMP OF CLAY IS CENTERED
Ge7uaPsauLI_17 0 THIS PUTS THE CLAY IN A GOOD POSITION TO BE THROWN
Ge7uaPsauLI_18 0 ONCE AGAIN WE'RE NOT PULLING THE CLAY UP ON THE OUTSIDE OF THIS FORM WE'RE ACTUALLY SQUEEZING IT UP INTO ITSELF
Ge7uaPsauLI_19 0 I'M GOING TO DO IT ONCE MORE JUST SO YOU CAN SEE HOW I'M DOING THIS
Ge7uaPsauLI_20 0 I USE THIS PART OF MY HAND HERE TO PUSH IT ONTO CENTER
Ge7uaPsauLI_21 0 I USE THIS PART OF MY HAND HERE TO PUSH THE CLAY DOWN
Ge7uaPsauLI_22 0 I USE BOTH OF THESE HANDS HERE TO SQUEEZE UP THE CLAY LIKE THAT
Ge7uaPsauLI_23 0 AND THEN I USE THIS PART TO PUSH DOWN THIS PART TO KEEP IT ON CENTER
Ge7uaPsauLI_24 0 NOW I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE MY RIB TOOL AND GET RID OF A LITTLE BIT OF THE EXCESS ON THERE
Ge7uaPsauLI_25 0 AND WE HAVE NOW CENTERED THIS PIECE OF CLAY AND WE ARE READY NOW TO MOVE ON TO OPENING THE CLAY AND PREPARING IT TO BE THROWN
Ge7uaPsauLI_26 0 AND WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT NEXT
GqgEYkquDAk_1 0 NOW THAT WE KNOW HOW TO SPIN OUR POI FORWARD AND BACKWARD LET'S TRY A FUN LITTLE TRICK THAT LETS YOU SWITCH FROM GOING FORWARDS TO BACKWARDS
GqgEYkquDAk_2 0 THIS IS JUST A SIMPLE TECHNIQUE THAT IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS A STALL AND IT IS ESSENTIALLY JUST STOPPING YOUR POI IN MID AIR WHEN YOU REACH THE FARTHEST POINT AWAY FROM YOU AND REVERSING THEIR DIRECTION
GqgEYkquDAk_3 0 LEARNING THIS TECHNIQUE ALSO HELPS YOU TO HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER YOUR POI
GqgEYkquDAk_4 0 REMEMBER IT IS YOU THAT IS CONTROLLING THE POI NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND
GqgEYkquDAk_5 0 AN ADVANCED VERSION OF THIS MOVE IS TO JUST STALL ONE POI KEEPING THE OTHER ONE GOING THE WAY THAT IT WAS AND THEN YOU HAVE YOUR POI MOVING IN TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
GqgEYkquDAk_6 0 THIS IS AN INSTANCE WHERE KEEPING YOUR BRAIN OUT OF IT IS ACTUALLY EASIER THAN IF YOU TRY AND THINK ABOUT IT TOO HARD
giDT_BvSfsA_1 0 HI THIS IS TODD SHAWN TEI CHIEF INSTRUCTOR OF CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF MARTIAL ARTS LOCATED IN BURBANK CALIFORNIA AT KUNGFUWINGCHUNG.COM
giDT_BvSfsA_2 0 TODAY WE ARE GOING TO COVER WOMENS SELF DEFENSE
giDT_BvSfsA_3 0 WE ARE GOING TO START OFF WITH THE HEADLOCK
giDT_BvSfsA_4 0 SOMEONE GRABS YOU IN A HEADLOCK GRAB THE ARM DROP DOWN ELBOWS KICK STRIKE
giDT_BvSfsA_5 0 NOW WE ARE GOING TO SLOW IT DOWN
giDT_BvSfsA_6 0 FIRST THING GRAB THE ARMS SECOND YOU DROP YOUR WEIGHT INTO A HORSE STANCE WHICH FORCES THE PERSON DOWN THEN YOU GO INTO SOME STRIKES ELBOWS KICK THE KNEE TURN BRING THE KNEE UP TO THE ELBOW AND STRIKE BEHIND THE KNEE
giDT_BvSfsA_9 0 THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS YOU GRAB THE ARM WITH BOTH OF YOUR ARMS AND YOU DROP YOUR WEIGHT DOWN INTO THE HORSE STANCE RIGHT AWAY IT FORCES THE PERSON DOWN AND THAT IS A HARD POSITION FOR THEM TO MAINTAIN THEIR HOLD
giDT_BvSfsA_10 0 THEN YOU GO INTO SOME STRIKES BUT YOU STILL LEAVE ONE HAND HOLDING THE ARM
giDT_BvSfsA_11 0 STRIKING WITH ELBOWS TURNING YOUR HIPS INTO THE STRIKES
giDT_BvSfsA_12 0 THEN YOU STRIKE LIKE A DONKEY KICK INTO THE KNEE AND THEN BRING OUT THE ARM BREAK THE ELBOW WITH THE KNEE AND STRIKE TO THE KNEECAP OR BEHIND THE KNEE
giDT_BvSfsA_13 0 THAT IS HOW YOU GET OUT OF A HEADLOCK
hi92yBCeRyM_1 0 HI IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO TALK ABOUT A NAIL DELAY AND WHAT A NAIL DELAY IS IS WHEN YOU'RE SPINNING THE FRISBEE ON YOUR NAIL
hi92yBCeRyM_2 0 NOW WHAT PEOPLE THINK IS YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HOLD YOUR FINGER IN ONE SPOT A LOT LIKE WHEN YOU'RE SPINNING A BASKETBALL BUT THE ACTUAL TRUTH IS IS YOU HAVE TO KEEP ADJUSTING YOUR NAIL AND TRYING TO ALWAYS FIND THE CENTER
hi92yBCeRyM_3 0 SO WHAT ALSO WITH A NAIL DELAY YOU NEED TO PUT A LOT OF SPIN ON YOUR FRISBEE
hi92yBCeRyM_4 0 IF YOU DON'T PUT A LOT OF SPIN ON YOUR FRISBEE IT'S GOING TO BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO DO A NAIL DELAY AND YOU WANT YOUR FRISBEE TO COME DOWN NICE AND FLAT
hi92yBCeRyM_5 0 SO TO DO THE SET FOR THE FOR THE NAIL DELAY YOU WANT TO PUT SOME SPIN ON IT AND KEEP THAT NAIL RIGHT IN THE CENTER FOLLOWING THE CENTER AT ALL TIMES
hi92yBCeRyM_6 0 IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS DOING IT ON ONE NAIL YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY TWO NAILS OR YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY WHAT WE CALL THE CLAW USE ALL OF YOUR FINGERNAILS SO ALL OF YOUR NAILS ARE IN CONTACT WITH THE BOTTOM OF THE FRISBEE
hi92yBCeRyM_7 0 AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY BALANCE IT THERE WITHOUT IT SPINNING BUT IF YOU COULD PUT SOME SPIN ON IT AND HAVE THAT CLAW DELAY AND THEN YOU CAN GO TO TWO FINGERS AND THEN ONE FINGER AND YOU'LL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GET CONTROL WHICH WILL OPEN UP THE DOOR TO MANY MANY MANY MORE TRICKS
GlULfF3Z-r4_1 0 OKAY NOW ONCE YOU'VE FINISHED YOUR ACUPRESSURE POINTS YOU'VE DONE YOUR MASSAGE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU NOT JUST LEAP UP AND RUN OFF AND HAVE THE DOG COME CHASING AFTER YOU OR YOU THROW THE DOG OUT IN THE YARD OR HAVE HIM PLAY WITH THE KIDS
GlULfF3Z-r4_2 0 THIS IS A TIME WHEN IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO BE QUIET TO SIT QUIETLY LIE QUIETLY
GlULfF3Z-r4_3 0 IT'S A NICE TIME TO BOND WITH YOUR ANIMAL JUST SITTING THERE ENJOYING HIS COMPANY
GlULfF3Z-r4_4 0 YOU CAN PET HIM BUT YOU REALLY WANT TO KEEP HIM QUIET AS POSSIBLE AND LET THOSE BONES AND MUSCLES JUST RELAX AFTER HAVING BEEN SMOOTHED AND EASED
GlULfF3Z-r4_5 0 LET THAT ENERGY MOVE AND LET THE ANIMAL RECOVER FROM THE SESSION
GlULfF3Z-r4_6 0 FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO'VE BEEN THROUGH MASSAGE YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO JUST LIE STILL FOR A WHILE AFTER THAT MASSAGE
GlULfF3Z-r4_7 0 NOT TO LEAP OFF THE TABLE AND THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH YOUR DOG
GlULfF3Z-r4_8 0 SPEND THAT QUALITY TIME LET HIM RELAX
GlULfF3Z-r4_9 0 QUITE OFTEN IT'S BEST TO DO THIS IN THE EVENING TOWARD THE END OF YOUR DAY
GlULfF3Z-r4_10 0 IT'S NOT A BAD THING TO DO JUST BEFORE BEDTIME
GlULfF3Z-r4_11 0 I JUST LET HIM GO TO SLEEP AFTERWARD AND THEN HE WILL BE COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE AND HE'LL GET GREAT BENEFIT FROM WHAT YOU'VE DONE
gxR80UtVN7k_1 0 OKAY LETS MAKE SOME FLOWERS
gxR80UtVN7k_2 0 WE ARE GOING TO START WITH A WOODEN SKEWER
gxR80UtVN7k_3 0 AND WE ARE GOING TO CHOOSE A RATHER LARGE CARROT AND KIND OF TWIST THE SKEWER IN TO THE CENTER OF THE CARROT
gxR80UtVN7k_4 0 PLACE IT AROUND THERE ABOUT TWO TO THREE INCHES DOWN
gxR80UtVN7k_5 0 NOW WE WANT TO CHOOSE OUR PETALS
gxR80UtVN7k_6 0 I AM GOING TO USE SOME OF THIS NICE GIANT RADISH
gxR80UtVN7k_7 0 AND IF YOU CHOOSE YOU CAN CHOOSE LIKE FIVE PETALS FOR A BASIC FLOWER
gxR80UtVN7k_8 0 ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE
gxR80UtVN7k_9 0 AND IF THEY ARE GRADUATING IN SIZE WHICH THE USUALLY DO BECAUSE OF THE ROUNDNESS OF THE VEGETABLE YOU WILL HAVE BIGGER ONES AND SMALLER ONES
gxR80UtVN7k_10 0 YOU WANT TO PUT THEM IN ORDER FROM LARGER TO SMALLER
gxR80UtVN7k_11 0 AND THEN THESE ARE NICELY SHAPED SO WE DON'T NEED TO SHAPE THESE AT ALL
gxR80UtVN7k_12 0 AND ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS PUT A LITTLE SLICE ABOUT AN INCH OR 1/2 INCH DEPENDING UPON THE PETAL AND HOW IT WORKS
gxR80UtVN7k_13 0 YOU WILL PLAY WITH IT AND YOU WILL SEE
gxR80UtVN7k_14 0 PUT ABOUT AN INCH SLICE IN TO THE PETAL LIKE THIS FOR EACH FLOWER PETAL
gxR80UtVN7k_15 0 ONE LITTLE SLICE
gxR80UtVN7k_16 0 AND THE STARTING WITH THE LARGEST PETAL YOU WANT TO TAKE THE TWO FLAPS ON EITHER SIDE OF THAT SLICE AND FOLD IT OVER LIKE THIS
gxR80UtVN7k_17 0 IT GIVES THE PETAL OOPS IT GIVES THE PETAL A ROUNDNESS
gxR80UtVN7k_18 0 AND THEN YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR SKEWER THROUGH THE CENTER OF THOSE TWO OVERLAPPING FLAPS
gxR80UtVN7k_19 0 AND IF YOU TWIST IT IT HELPS PREVENT THE PETAL FROM CRACKING AND BREAKING
gxR80UtVN7k_20 0 NOW IT ISN'T UNUSUAL FOR THE VEGETABLE BECAUSE IT IS FIRM TO CRACK OR BREAK
gxR80UtVN7k_21 0 AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL HAVE TO JUST THROW ONE OUT AND GRAB A NEW ONE
gxR80UtVN7k_22 0 NOW YOU KEEP GOING LIKE THIS SO MAKE THIS LITTLE CUP THAT LOOKS LIKE A PETAL
gxR80UtVN7k_23 0 AND THIS ONE AGAIN YOU ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE CENTER TWIST THAT SKEWER
gxR80UtVN7k_24 0 IT ALMOST SCREWS IT IN THERE A LITTLE LIKE A DRILL
gxR80UtVN7k_25 0 AND PLACE THIS ONE OPPOSITE THE FIRST
gxR80UtVN7k_26 0 NOW CONTINUE WITH THE NEXT PETAL FOLDING IT OVER AND COMING THROUGH WITH THE SKEWER
gxR80UtVN7k_27 0 I WILL SHOW YOU ON THIS SIDE
gxR80UtVN7k_28 0 COMING THROUGH THE CENTER OF THOSE TWO FLAPS
gxR80UtVN7k_29 0 NOW PLACE THIS ONE IN BETWEEN THE TWO THAT ARE FACING EACH OTHER
gxR80UtVN7k_30 0 AND OUR FOURTH ONE AGAIN THROUGH THE CENTER AND PUSH THAT DOWN
gxR80UtVN7k_31 0 YOU SEE IT IS STARTING TO LOOK LIKE A ROSE
gxR80UtVN7k_32 0 AN THE LAST ONE YOU MAY WANT TO REALLY ROLL UP TIGHT
gxR80UtVN7k_33 0 YOU CAN EVEN REMOVE A LITTLE BIT OF VEGETABLE THERE SO THAT YOU CAN PULL THIS TIGHT
gxR80UtVN7k_34 0 IT MAKES IT MUCH MORE CUP AND THAT IS NICE TO PUT FOR THE MIDDLE
gxR80UtVN7k_36 0 NOW AT THIS POINT IF YOU WANT TO PUSH THE FLOWER UP SO YOU DON'T HAVE SO MUCH SKEWER YOU CAN GRASP THE SKEWER TIGHTLY AND JUST PUSH IT UP
gxR80UtVN7k_37 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T PUSH THE WHOLE FLOWER OFF THE SKEWER
gxR80UtVN7k_38 0 AND YOU WANT TO FINISH UP WITH A CARROT IN THE CENTER
gJqQrAkp6o4_2 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT PAIN AND AILMENTS IN A DOG
gJqQrAkp6o4_3 0 WHEN YOU'RE DOING DOG MASSAGE EVERY DOG IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW FROM SPEAKING WITH YOUR VET WHERE YOUR DOG'S PAIN AND AILMENTS ARE
gJqQrAkp6o4_4 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO STOP START AT THE TOP OF THE BODY AND GO THROUGH TO THE BACK OF THE BODY AND SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF MANEUVERS THAT YOU CAN DO
gJqQrAkp6o4_5 0 NOW A LOT OF DOGS MAY GET PAIN IN THEIR UPPER SHOULDERS AND WHAT YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS GET THE CIRCULATION MOVING THROUGH THEIR SHOULDERS
gJqQrAkp6o4_6 0 I ALWAYS LIKE TO MASSAGE UPWARDS SO YOU'RE MOVING THE CIRCULATION UP TOWARDS THE HEART
gJqQrAkp6o4_7 0 YOU CAN MASSAGE AROUND THE ELBOWS IF THEY'RE HAVING ELBOW DYSPLASIA
gJqQrAkp6o4_8 0 AND AGAIN EVEN ON THE LIMBS MASSAGING ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH GETTING THE CIRCULATION TO THE HEART MOVING THE ENDORPHINS TO HELP THEM FEEL BETTER
gJqQrAkp6o4_9 0 IF THEY'RE HAVING PAIN THROUGHOUT THEIR BACK AGAIN YOU JUST WANT TO DO NICE LIGHT MOVEMENTS MAYBE A COUPLE OF CIRCLES AROUND THE SPINE
gJqQrAkp6o4_10 0 AND AGAIN I ALWAYS GO IN AN UPWARD MOTION TOWARDS THE HEART
gJqQrAkp6o4_11 0 AS YOU MOVE TOWARDS THE REAR OF THE ANIMAL A LOT OF DOGS ESPECIALLY AS THEY GET OLDER OR HAVE HIP DYSPLASIA GET A LOT OF PAIN INTO THE HIPS
gJqQrAkp6o4_12 0 SO AGAIN NICE MOTIONS CIRCULAR MOTIONS AND UP THROUGH THE LEGS AND ALL THE WAY UP TO THE HEART
GjlPwFc7kpI_1 0 RYAN LARSON NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A VISUAL LOOK AT THE SCALE
GjlPwFc7kpI_2 0 SO IF WE START BY FIRST LOOKING AT THE TAB YOU HAVE OUR FOUR STRINGS HERE RIGHT
GjlPwFc7kpI_3 0 THERE'S YOUR TOP STRING DOWN TO YOUR LOW STRING AND THEN WE STARTED ON ZERO TWO FOUR ZERO TWO FOUR ONE TWO FOUR ONE TWO FOUR RIGHT
GjlPwFc7kpI_4 0 SO WE STARTED RIGHT HERE BOTTOM STRING ZERO TWO FOUR ZERO TWO FOUR ONE TWO THEN IF YOU KEEP GOING UP THE SCALE YOU GOT FOUR ONE TWO FOUR
GjlPwFc7kpI_5 0 AND YOU NOTICE BELOW I PUT THE NAMES OF THE ACTUAL NOTES IN THE SCALE SO YOU CAN SEE THEM BELOW AND YOU'LL NOTICE I PUT A SQUARE AROUND THE ROOT E AND E AND THEN OUR 5TH WHICH IS B WHICH IS RIGHT HERE ON THE 3RD STRING 2ND FRET
GjlPwFc7kpI_6 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO WALK UP NOW THEN WE'RE GOING TO SAY THE ACTUAL NAMES OF THE NOTES
GjlPwFc7kpI_7 0 E F SHARP G SHARP B C SHARP D SHARP E E D SHARP C SHARP B A G SHARP F SHARP E AND IF WE START FROM THE HIGH E AND KEEP GOING UP WE HAVE E F SHARP G SHARP A B
GjlPwFc7kpI_8 0 SO WE HAVE NOW IF WE NUMBER EACH ON THESE NOTES WE HAVE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE
GjlPwFc7kpI_9 0 SO WE JUST GO UP TO SEVEN RIGHT
GjlPwFc7kpI_10 0 IT'S A SEVEN-NOTE SCALE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN AND WE START AGAIN ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE
GjlPwFc7kpI_11 0 SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH AND EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW TO UTILIZE THE DIFFERENT NOTES OUT OF EACH DEGREE THAT WE SEE COMING OUT OF THE BASS
HejANctY6Jw_2 0 THANKS FOR RECLICKING ON EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
HejANctY6Jw_3 0 I'M ONCE AGAIN HOWARD LEFSTEIN AND HERE WE ARE BACK IN MALIBU CALIFORNIA TALKING ABOUT HAZARDS IN SURFING WAVE SIZE AND POTENTIAL STUFF THAN CAN KILL YOU BESIDES THE SHARKS
HejANctY6Jw_4 0 WE WON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT SHARKS
HejANctY6Jw_5 0 JUST KEEP WATCHING SHARK WEEK AND YOU'LL BE GOOD TO GO ON YOUR SHARKS
HejANctY6Jw_6 0 A WAVE CAN BE ANYWHERE FROM ANKLE HIGH TO EIGHTY FEET WHICH HAS BEEN RIDDEN SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD
HejANctY6Jw_7 0 TODAY WE'RE ONLY GOING TO GET ABOUT ANKLE HIGH TO ABOUT CHEST HIGH WHICH IS MAYBE TWO THREE FEET
HejANctY6Jw_8 0 YOU CAN DESCRIBE A WAVE FROM BEING ANKLE TO HEAD HIGH AS WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS MAYBE ONE FOUR FOOT
HejANctY6Jw_9 0 BUT IF YOU'RE IN HAWAII OR SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD THEY'RE GOING TO DESCRIBE IT FROM THE BACK OF THE WAVE WHICH IS MEASURABLE SURF
HejANctY6Jw_10 0 IF YOU'RE IN HAWAII AND THEY SAY TWO FOUR FOOT YOU'RE LOOKING ABOUT A FOUR EIGHT FOOT FACE FROM THE FRONT
HejANctY6Jw_11 0 IF YOU'RE IN THE OCEAN AND YOU SEE A BIG SURF AND YOU SEE IT FROM THE BEACH AND IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S HEAD IT'S RUNNING ABOUT HEAD HIGH THERE
HejANctY6Jw_12 0 IF IT LOOKS OVER THEIR HEAD IT COULD BE DOUBLED OVER HEAD SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY TO DESCRIBE IT
HejANctY6Jw_13 0 HAZARDS AT THE BEACH CAN BE RIP CURRENTS
HejANctY6Jw_14 0 A RIP CURRENT USUALLY HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF WATER COMING TOWARDS THE BEACH AND THERE'S NOWHERE TO FLOOD BACK BECAUSE THE WAVES KEEP COMING
HejANctY6Jw_15 0 ONCE AGAIN THE WATER GOING BACK INTO THE OCEAN IS GOING TO CREATE A LITTLE RIVER THAT IS FLOWING ALONG THE SIDE OF THE WAVE WHICH IS THE SIDE OF THE SANDBAR
HejANctY6Jw_16 0 IF YOU GET STUCK IN A RIP CURRENT THE BEST THING I CAN DO IS YELL FOR HELP WHICH IS HELP OR JUST SIT THERE AND DRIFT OUT OF THE RIP CURRENT AND THEN TRY TO SWIM TO THE BEACH
HejANctY6Jw_17 0 IF YOU'RE REALLY DESPERATE AND WANT TO GET OUT OF IT RIGHT A WAY THE BEST THING IS SWIM PARALLEL TO THE BEACH WAVING YOUR ARMS AND YELLING
HejANctY6Jw_18 0 THE NEXT HAZARD COULD BE SEALS PORPOISES SHARKS WHALES OTHER KINDS OF FISH WHICH ARE GOING TO ENCOUNTER
HejANctY6Jw_19 0 IF ONE HAPPENS JUST PULL UP YOUR FEET AND JUST LET IT GO BY
HejANctY6Jw_20 0 IF YOU GET REALLY SPOOKED GO INSIDE AND DON'T PADDLE BACK OUT
HejANctY6Jw_21 0 IF YOU STEP ON SOME ROCKS YOU COULD CUT YOUR FEET SO ONCE AGAIN BOOTIES REALLY HELP
HejANctY6Jw_22 0 ANOTHER THING TO KNOW IS ALWAYS HAVE ASK SOMEONE BEFORE YOU GO SURFING IF YOU'VE NEVER SURFED THERE AND THEY WILL HELP EXPLAIN THE TECHNIQUE IN GETTING IN AND OUT OF THE SURF
HejANctY6Jw_23 0 ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO GET IN AND ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO GET OUT
HejANctY6Jw_24 0 THERE'S TWO RULES IN SURFING
HejANctY6Jw_25 0 NUMBER ONE IS NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON THE OCEAN AND NUMBER TWO ALWAYS RIDE A WAVE IN
HejANctY6Jw_26 0 AGAIN I'M HOWARD LEFSTEIN ON EXPERTVILLAGE.COM

HjOL9Vl9wGU_5 0 YOU CAN GET THEM FOR A CHILD YOU CAN GET THEM FOR ADULT WHICH IS THE ONE YOU SEE HERE OR YOU CAN GET THEM FOR PROFESSIONAL USE
HjOL9Vl9wGU_6 0 NOW THE CHILD ONES ARE A LOT SMALLER THAN THIS ONE RIGHT HERE
HjOL9Vl9wGU_7 0 THEY ARE MADE OUT OF MOSTLY PLASTIC AND THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE BREAKABLE BUT FOR THE MONEY IT'S WORTH IT
HjOL9Vl9wGU_8 0 THE NEXT ONE IS THE ADULT STILT

HjOL9Vl9wGU_10 0 THIS ONE I'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE IN DEPTH IN JUST A MINUTE
HjOL9Vl9wGU_11 0 BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY A PROFESSIONAL STILT THESE ARE ONES THAT YOU WOULD SEE AT SUPER BOWL HALFTIME SHOW-TYPE THINGS WHERE THESE GUYS ARE DOING BACK FLIPS OR JUMPING UP AND DOWN WALLS DOING CRAZY STUFF
HjOL9Vl9wGU_12 0 THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE ADVANCED THOUGH OKAY
HjOL9Vl9wGU_13 0 THE NEXT THING IS A DRYWALL STILT
HjOL9Vl9wGU_14 0 NOW DRYWALL STILT IS THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT STILT OKAY
HjOL9Vl9wGU_15 0 IT COMES WITH IT HAS A FLAT PART FOR YOUR FOOT IT'S GOT THE STRAP AROUND YOUR LEG IT GOES DOWN WITH TWO PEGS USUALLY TO ANOTHER FLAT FOOT OKAY
HjOL9Vl9wGU_16 0 THESE ARE BASICALLY JUST AN EXTENSION OF YOUR OWN LEG OKAY
HjOL9Vl9wGU_17 0 ONCE YOU'RE UP ON THESE YOU ARE VERY STABLE YOU CAN WALK AROUND FINE IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL USING THOSE STILTS
HjOL9Vl9wGU_18 0 PRETTY MUCH ANYBODY CAN USE THOSE STILTS
HjOL9Vl9wGU_19 0 THEY'RE USUALLY MADE OUT OF WOOD OR ALUMINUM
HjOL9Vl9wGU_20 0 NOW THE NEXT STILT IS CALLED THE PEG STILT OKAY
HjOL9Vl9wGU_21 0 THESE RANGE IN ALL DIFFERENT SIZES JUST LIKE THE DRYWALL STILTS BUT THEY ARE JUST A ONE PEG WHICH IS USUALLY MADE OUT OF WOOD
HjOL9Vl9wGU_22 0 IT COMES UP IT HAS A PLATFORM FOR YOUR FOOT STAND AND THEN IT STRAPS AROUND YOUR LEG AND IT IS MUCH LIKE THIS WHERE IT'S GOT ONE SMALL PEG AT THE BOTTOM SO IT'S VERY HARD TO STAND STILL ON THEM OKAY

HbCcyacx4io_6 0 OR SOME WILL HAVE A SIMPLE BASIC RIM LIKE THIS BUT THEY WILL HAVE CHAINED NETS LIKE WE HAVE HERE
HbCcyacx4io_7 0 NOW ALSO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PLAYING BALL THE BRACE LOTS OF TIMES YOU'LL SEE A POLE LIKE THIS WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING OUTDOORS OR YOU'LL SEE AN ACTUAL COMBINATION OF THINGS BRACING THE BACKBOARD UP IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT INDOORS
HbCcyacx4io_8 0 YOU WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THOUGH THAT THE NETS REALLY DO HAVE A PURPOSE SO IF YOU'RE SETTING UP YOUR OWN BASKETBALL HOOP AT HOME YOU WANT TO DEFINITELY PUT A NET UP IT PREVENTS THE BALL FROM GOING OUT OF BOUNDS AND YOU HAVING TO CHASE IT DOWN ALL OVER THE PLACE
HbCcyacx4io_9 0 SO HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GOAL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NET AND ITS PURPOSE

GR9xo2MY36E_1 0 SO NOW YOU'VE GOT TO SET YOUR POINTER BEFORE YOU THROW YOUR BOWL
GR9xo2MY36E_2 0 I'VE GOT A LITTLE DRY ERASE BOARD RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THAT I ALWAYS KEEP IN FRONT OF MY WHEEL THAT TELLS ME THE BASIC WEIGHTS AND SIZES OF SOME OF MY SIMPLE ITEMS LIKE THIS IS A SALAD BOWL
GR9xo2MY36E_3 0 AND THAT BOARD TELLS ME THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE NINE INCHES WIDE AND TWO AND A HALF INCHES TALL
GR9xo2MY36E_4 0 SO THE FIRST THING I DO FOR SETTING MY POINTER IS I TAKE A WET SPONGE AGAINST MY BAT AND I MAKE A PERFECT CIRCLE
GR9xo2MY36E_5 0 AND THEN I TAKE HALF OF MY SPLASH PAN AWAY SO THAT I CAN MEASURE THAT CIRCLE FLAT ON THE BOARD
GR9xo2MY36E_6 0 I WANT IT TO GO STRAIGHT THROUGH THE CENTER SO THAT I'M SURE I'M GETTING THE FULLEST DIAMETER
GR9xo2MY36E_7 0 NOW THAT'S JUST OVER SEVEN INCHES SO I'M GOING TO WANT THAT TO BE WIDER THAN THAT
GR9xo2MY36E_8 0 AND YOU JUST KEEP DOING THIS PART OF THE PROCESS UNTIL THAT CIRCLE IS THE SIZE THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
GR9xo2MY36E_9 0 AND I JUST REALIZED THAT THAT IS FOR A LARGE SALAD PLATE LARGE SALAD BOWL AND I'M TRYING TO DO A SMALL ONE HERE
GR9xo2MY36E_10 0 SO I NEED SEVEN INCHES
GR9xo2MY36E_11 0 AND THE WAY YOU CAN FIX IT IF YOU'VE GOT TOO MUCH OF A WET SPACE IS JUST PUT A LITTLE BIT OF CLAY FROM YOUR DRIP PAN
GR9xo2MY36E_12 0 MAKE YOURSELF ANOTHER CIRCLE
GR9xo2MY36E_13 0 AND THAT ONE IS RIGHT AT SEVEN INCHES
GR9xo2MY36E_14 0 SO NOW I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO ADJUST THE HEIGHT OF YOUR POINTER
GnMYs5Jj2BI_1 0 WHEN YOU'RE WORKING AND LIVING WITH ADHD AGAIN WHETHER YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE BENEFIT OF MEDICATION OR WITHOUT
GnMYs5Jj2BI_2 0 ONE OF THOSE HARMFUL PARTS OF HAVING ADHD IS WE TEND TO GET DOWN ON OURSELVES.WE'RE NATURALLY SORT OF IMPULSIVE IMPATIENT PEOPLE
GnMYs5Jj2BI_3 0 AND IT'S HURTFUL TO BE IMPATIENT WITH YOURSELF
GnMYs5Jj2BI_4 0 YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE WITH THIS DISORDER AND LEARN TO THE LIVE LIFE THAT YOU WANT TO LIVE AS BEST AS POSSIBLE

GnMYs5Jj2BI_6 0 IT'S NEGATIVE SELF TALK IS ONE OF THE MOST DAMAGING THINGS A PERSON CAN DO
GnMYs5Jj2BI_7 0 THERE'S ENOUGH IN THIS WORLD TO PUT A PERSON DOWN AND TO MAKE A PERSON FEEL INADEQUATE WITHOUT YOUR OWN INTERNAL DIALOG ADDING TO THAT
GnMYs5Jj2BI_8 0 SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THIS IS A DISORDER THAT DOESN'T HAVE A CURE
GnMYs5Jj2BI_9 0 IT HAS A NUMBER OF TREATMENT STYLES
GnMYs5Jj2BI_10 0 SOME THAT INVOLVE MEDICATION AND THE CHOICE YOU'RE MAKING WHICH IS TO GO WITHOUT MEDICATION
GnMYs5Jj2BI_11 0 IT TAKES TIME FOR ANY SORT OF TREATMENT TO WORK
GnMYs5Jj2BI_12 0 IT TAKES PRACTICE
GnMYs5Jj2BI_13 0 AND FOR A LOT OF US WITH ADULT ADHD WE HAVEN'T HAD OUR WHOLE LIVES TO LEARN HOW TO LIVE WITH THIS DISORDER
GnMYs5Jj2BI_14 0 WE DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD THIS DISORDER UNTIL RECENTLY
GnMYs5Jj2BI_15 0 SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE NICE TO YOURSELF
GnMYs5Jj2BI_16 0 BE PATIENT WITH YOURSELF
GnMYs5Jj2BI_17 0 AND REMEMBER THAT YOU'RE UNIQUE AND SPECIAL PERSON NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE OR ANYTHING AROUND YOU TELLS YOU

GLacDJBrFfs_1 0 HI I'M MIKE LOPEZ WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'LL BE DISCUSSING ARTIFACTS FROM MAGIC THE GATHERING AND NOW I'M GOING TO DISCUSS ARCBOUND LANCER
GLacDJBrFfs_2 0 ARCBOUND LANCER IS AN ARTIFACT CREATURE THAT IS AN UNCOMMON IT COSTS YOU SEVEN TO PUT IT IN PLAY
GLacDJBrFfs_3 0 IT IS A ZERO/ZERO CREATURE WHICH MEANS THAT IT IS GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT GIVES IT COUNTERS
GLacDJBrFfs_4 0 IN THIS INSTANCE IT HAS A MODULAR OF FOUR WHICH MEANS THAT IT COMES INTO PLAY WITH FOUR PLUS ONE PLUS ONE COUNTERS ON IT AND WHICH MEANS THAT WHEN THIS CREATURE GOES TO THE GRAVEYARD YOU CAN TAKE ALL FOUR OF THE PLUS ONE PLUS ONE COUNTERS THAT ARE ON ARCBOUND LANCER AND MOVE THEM TO OR DIVIDE THEM UP AND MOVE THEM AMONGST TARGET ARTIFACT CREATURES
GLacDJBrFfs_5 0 ONCE AGAIN MODULAR IS A SPECIFIC THING THAT ONLY OCCURS WITH ARTIFACT CREATURES AND IN ADDITION TO GETTING A FOUR/FOUR WITH THE SPECIAL MODULAR FOR SEVEN THIS CREATURE ALSO HAS FIRST STRIKE WHICH MEANS IT DEALS ITS COMBAT DAMAGE FIRST AND WILL KILL OFF ANY CREATURE THAT IS A FOUR/FOUR AND CAN ALSO KILL OFF AN EIGHT/EIGHT BECAUSE IT WILL DEAL ITS COMBAT DAMAGE FIRST
GLacDJBrFfs_6 0 THEN YOU CAN MOVE THE MODULAR TO ANOTHER BLOCKER IN THE SAME INSTANCE WHEN THIS CREATURE GOES TO THE GRAVEYARD TO KILL OFF THE LARGER FOE

gCFVjO5LiBE_19 0 BUT PREFERABLY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE IT CHLORINE FILTERED USING A BRITA FILTER
gvrq6Nw-8S8_1 0 HI I'M TRISTAN MCCAULEY FROM LUCKY SEVEN TATOO AND I'M HERE JUST TO GIVE YOU A FEW FACTS ABOUT BODY PIERCING JEWELRY
gvrq6Nw-8S8_2 0 THE FIRST THING WE HAVE IS A BELLY JEWEL AND IT IS THE MOST COMMON THING USED IN A BELLY BUTTON PIERCING NOW
gvrq6Nw-8S8_3 0 IT USED TO BE THE CAPTIVE BEAD RING BUT SINCE THEY DISCOVERED THAT IT DOESN'T MOVE FROM SIDE TO SIDE AS MUCH AND THERE IS NOT AS MUCH IRRITATION
gvrq6Nw-8S8_4 0 THE SECOND THING WE HAVE IS THE TONGUE BARBELL
gvrq6Nw-8S8_5 0 IT IS JUST A SHORT BARBELL WITH TWO BEADS ON THE END
gvrq6Nw-8S8_6 0 THEY SCREW ON AND SCREW OFF
gvrq6Nw-8S8_7 0 ANOTHER THING YOU HAVE IS THE NOSE SCREW AND THIS JUST TURNS IN AND SHOOTS UP
gvrq6Nw-8S8_8 0 IT GOES STRAIGHT IN LOOKS NICE AND SITS FLUSH WITH THE SKIN
gvrq6Nw-8S8_9 0 ANOTHER ONE YOU HAVE IS THE HORSESHOE BARBELL
gvrq6Nw-8S8_10 0 IT IS SIMILAR TO THE CURVED BARBELL BUT IT JUST HAS MORE OF AN ARC TO IT
gvrq6Nw-8S8_11 0 THE BALLS SCREW ON AND OFF MUCH LIKE THE OTHER TWO
gvrq6Nw-8S8_12 0 THE NEXT THING YOU HAVE IS THE LABRAY POST
gvrq6Nw-8S8_13 0 THIS IS JUST A FLAT BACK STUD WITH A BALL THAT SCREWS ON AND OFF
gvrq6Nw-8S8_14 0 YOU CAN USE IT FOR LABRAYS REGULAR LIP PIERCINGS AND SOME PEOPLE USE THEM FOR TRAYS AS WELL
gvrq6Nw-8S8_15 0 THE NEXT IS A CURVED BARBELL WHICH IS SIMILAR TO YOUR BELLY JEWEL IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE JEWEL ON THE END OF IT AND IT IS NOT AS BIG AT THE BOTTOM AND THE BALLS ARE THE SAME SIZE AND BOTH SCREW ON AND SCREW OFF
gvrq6Nw-8S8_16 0 NEXT IS THE CAPTIVE BEAD AND THE CAPTIVE BEAD IS A SMALL HOOP WITH THE BALL SUSPENDED SIX DAYS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND THE BALL POPS RIGHT OUT AND SHOULD POP RIGHT BACK IN LIKE THIS
gvrq6Nw-8S8_17 0 THEN YOU HAVE THE GAGES
gvrq6Nw-8S8_18 0 YOU HAVE A COUPLE DIFFERENT OPTIONS WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT PLUGS FOR THE STRETCHED EARS
gvrq6Nw-8S8_19 0 YOU HAVE THE STONE PLUGS AND YOU ALSO HAVE WOODEN
gvrq6Nw-8S8_20 0 YOU HAVE METAL AND YOU HAVE BONE OR ORGANIC
gvrq6Nw-8S8_21 0 A LOT OF PEOPLE USE THE ORGANIC THE WOOD THE BONE AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THE STONE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A REACTION TO THE METAL AS MUCH
gvrq6Nw-8S8_22 0 SOME PEOPLE GO WITH THE METAL JUST FOR THE LOOK IT'S SHINIER AND SOME PEOPLE THINK IT LOOKS BETTER
gvrq6Nw-8S8_23 0 A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN USE IN YOUR EAR OR ANY KIND OF PIERCING
gvrq6Nw-8S8_24 0 YOU CAN USE SURGICAL STAINLESS STEEL
gvrq6Nw-8S8_25 0 IT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO USE VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE REACTIONS TO IT
gvrq6Nw-8S8_26 0 ANOTHER ONE IS TITANIUM FOR PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE REACTIONS TO THE STAINLESS STEEL THE TITANIUM IS BETTER FOR THEM
gvrq6Nw-8S8_27 0 ANOTHER ONE IS NIOBIUM WHICH IS ANOTHER METAL THAT IS REALLY GOOD FOR PIERCINGS
gvrq6Nw-8S8_28 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE 418 KARAT GOLD
gvrq6Nw-8S8_29 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO USE ANYTHING OF A LESSER QUALITY THAN THAT AND YOU CAN USE WHITE OR YELLOW GOLD
gvrq6Nw-8S8_30 0 THEY BOTH WORK WELL
gvrq6Nw-8S8_31 0 ANOTHER ONE THAT PEOPLE HAVE JUST STARTED USING RECENTLY IS A SPECIAL PLASTIC CALLED TYGON
gvrq6Nw-8S8_32 0 WHAT TYGON IS IT IS FOR PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE SENSITIVE TO METALS
gvrq6Nw-8S8_33 0 A LOT OF PEOPLE USE IT IF THEY HAVE A REACTION TO THE NICKEL IN THE STAINLESS STEEL OR THEY JUST CAN'T TAKE THE TITANIUM OR THE GOLD SO TO USE THE TYGON YOU JUST SCREW THE LITTLE BALLS ON THE ENDS OF IT
gvrq6Nw-8S8_34 0 THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE FACTS ABOUT BODY PIERCING JEWELRY
GArBBcQ7bts_2 0 I'M EMILY LAREW AND IF YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING OUR PREVIOUS CLIP WE LANDED OUR LAST CLIP ON SEVEN
GArBBcQ7bts_3 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE ON IN OUR ADVANCED STEP COMBINATION WITH EIGHT ONE THROUGH FOUR
GArBBcQ7bts_5 0 SO WE JUST SAT INTO IT ON SEVEN UP HERE ON SEVEN HOLD EIGHT
GArBBcQ7bts_6 0 FROM THERE ON EIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO STOP YOUR LEFT FOOT FORWARD
GArBBcQ7bts_8 0 YOU HAVE HALF SHUFFLE STEP
GArBBcQ7bts_10 0 HALF SHUFFLE STEP
GArBBcQ7bts_12 0 YOU'RE GOING TO PENCIL TURN SO I WANT YOU TO PUSH YOUR ARMS DOWN
GArBBcQ7bts_13 0 SO WE GO EIGHT ONE AND TWO YOU'RE GOING TO TURN PENCIL TURN THREE
GArBBcQ7bts_14 0 SO AGAIN YOU'RE WAY ON THE BALLS OF YOUR FEET HANDS TABLETOP TOE RIGHT OUT IN FRONT OF YOU AND WHEN YOU'RE DOING A PENCIL TURN WITH NO NERVE TAPS YOU WANT TO JUST BARELY OFF THE FLOOR OKAY
GArBBcQ7bts_15 0 DON'T KEEP IT HIGH AT LIKE A FORTY-FIVE DEGREE ANGLE
GArBBcQ7bts_16 0 KEEP IT JUST A COUPLE INCHES OFF THE FLOOR
GArBBcQ7bts_17 0 SO FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT ONE AND TWO THREE YOU'RE GOING TO SIT DOWN WITH YOUR FOOT TOGETHER AND BEND YOUR KNEES IN THE SAME POSITION LIKE YOU'RE CUTE AS A CUCUMBER
GArBBcQ7bts_19 0 FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT ONE AND TWO THREE FOUR
hblyhyq9OoI_1 0 JOEL SIEGEL ALL RIGHT
hblyhyq9OoI_2 0 SO HERE WE GO WITH OUR NEXT BEAT
hblyhyq9OoI_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO DO THE DOWNBEAT OF ONE
hblyhyq9OoI_4 0 WE'RE GOING TO PLAY THE UPBEAT OF THREE AND DOWNBEAT OF FOUR ALL RIGHT
hblyhyq9OoI_5 0 THIS IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE WITH THE KICK AND THE SNARE
hblyhyq9OoI_7 0 KIND OF SIMILAR TO THE BEAT THAT WE DID EARLIER WHEN WE COVERED JUST LIKE THE JUST WITHOUT THE DOWNBEAT OF FOUR
hblyhyq9OoI_8 0 THAT'S LIKE KINDA CLASSIC ROCK SOUND
hblyhyq9OoI_9 0 THIS WILL KINDA GIVE YOU WITH THE FOUR ADDED IN IT KINDA GIVES YOU IT'S ALMOST LIKE I MEAN AT THIS TEMPO IT'S LIKE A DIRGE ALMOST KIND OF SOMEWHAT MARTIAL TO ME AT LEAST
hblyhyq9OoI_10 0 SO WHAT'S GOING TO BE LINING UP WE HAVE OUR DOWNBEAT OF ONE HI-HAT AND KICK WE HAVE OUR UPBEAT OF THREE HI-HAT AND KICK AND THEN OUR DOWNBEAT OF FOUR WE HAVE HI-HAT KICK AND SNARE
hblyhyq9OoI_12 0 SO TAKE A LOOK IN THIS NEXT CLIP AND TAKE A LISTEN AT THE BEAT
hblyhyq9OoI_13 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE YEAH WE'LL BE AT EIGHTY BPM AND WE'LL PLAY IT TOGETHER AS WELL
gXG1KvqSE7w_1 0 LET'S SEE HOW TO MAKE A PHONE CALL TO GREECE WHERE ONE CAN SEE A FEW OF THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD AND WHERE ONE CAN MEET THE SPIRITS OF ARISTOTLE
gXG1KvqSE7w_2 0 THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT GREECE THAT THE CONNECTIONS THERE ARE OFTEN VERY POOR
gXG1KvqSE7w_3 0 SO IF YOU ARE NOT THROUGH YOU JUST HAVE TO TRY TRY TRY
gXG1KvqSE7w_4 0 PLEASE DON'T GIVE IT UP
gXG1KvqSE7w_5 0 YOU'RE GOING TO BE ONE DAY CONNECTED
gXG1KvqSE7w_6 0 FIRST OF ALL LET'S SEE HOW TO DETERMINE WHAT TIME IT IS IN GREECE
gXG1KvqSE7w_7 0 GREECE IS TWO HOURS AHEAD OF GREENWICH MEAN TIME WHICH MEANS THAT IT IS SEVEN HOURS LATER IN GREECE THAN IT IS ON THE EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES
gXG1KvqSE7w_8 0 AND IN GREECE IT IS TEN HOURS LATER THAN IT IS ON THE WEST COAST
gXG1KvqSE7w_9 0 SO DIAL 011 AGAIN AS THE INTERNATIONAL ACCESS CODE
gXG1KvqSE7w_10 0 THE NUMBER THIRTY WILL COME WHICH YOU HAVE TO DIAL WHICH IS THE COUNTRY CODE OF GREECE
gXG1KvqSE7w_11 0 AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST REMOVE THE ZERO FROM THE CITY CODE
gXG1KvqSE7w_12 0 NOW I WILL TELL YOU A FEW CITY CODES
gXG1KvqSE7w_13 0 01 IS FOR ATHENS 061 IS FOR PATRAS 0661 IS FOR CORFU 04 AND 21 IS FOR THESSALY AND 031 IS FOR THESSALONIKI
gXG1KvqSE7w_14 0 LAST BUT NOT LEAST DIAL THE REMAINING NUMBERS
gt0Y5ZSZ7Cs_1 0 SOME OF THE THINGS THAT SCIENCE HAS BEEN SHOWING US LATELY IS THAT THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN OUR EMOTIONAL HEALTH AND OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH
gt0Y5ZSZ7Cs_2 0 FOR EXAMPLE THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO RECENTLY COUNTED A STUDY THAT SHOWED THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE LONELY TEND TO HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF THE FIRE-FLIGHT OR FIGHT CHEMICALS THAT WE PRODUCE WHEN WE'RE UNDER STRESS AND IT'S KIND OF A CHRONIC THING AND OVER TIME THEY'VE FOUND THAT CAN CAUSE INFLAMMATION IN THE BODY AND CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A WHOLE RANGE OF HEALTH DISORDERS
gt0Y5ZSZ7Cs_3 0 SO IT'S INTERESTING THAT SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS LONELINESS CAN HAVE ACTUALLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON YOUR HEALTH
gt0Y5ZSZ7Cs_4 0 SO THE IDEA HERE IS THAT IT PROBABLY IS A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE GOOD FRIENDS TO HAVE COMPANIONSHIP AND THEY'VE ALSO DONE RECENT STUDIES THAT SHOWED IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE HUMAN COMPANIONSHIP NECESSARILY THERE'S ALSO BEEN VERY POSITIVE HEALTH BENEFITS OF HAVING A PET FOR EXAMPLE
gt0Y5ZSZ7Cs_5 0 BUT THE IDEA IS THAT HAVING COMPANIONSHIP AND FRIENDSHIP IN A PERSON'S LIFE IS IMPORTANT FOR CONTRIBUTING TO OVERALL HEALTH OF YOUR PHYSICAL BODY
H9eXrX31IJk_1 0 SO WE'VE CONSTRUCTED ALL OF THE PARTS OF THE TURTLE OUT OF NEWSPAPER AND NOW WE'RE READY TO WRAP IT IN THE TIN FOIL
H9eXrX31IJk_2 0 I USE THE HEAVY DUTY TIN FOIL THAT WAY IT DOESN'T RIP THROUGH THE PROCESS
H9eXrX31IJk_3 0 HERE IS MY SHEET OF TIN FOIL I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO TRIM IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT
H9eXrX31IJk_4 0 BUT I'M CHOOSING TO USE THE FLAT SIDE AS THE BOTTOM BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO BE THE INTERIOR OF THE TURTLE
H9eXrX31IJk_5 0 THIS WILL BE THE TOP OF THE SHELL BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE MORE ROUNDED
H9eXrX31IJk_6 0 SO I'M GOING TO CUT DOWN THIS FOIL A LITTLE BIT AND WE'RE BASICALLY GOING TO BRING IT ALL INTO THE CENTER SIMILAR TO HOW WE DID THE ORIGINAL INSIDE NEWSPAPER SIDE OF THE SHELL
H9eXrX31IJk_7 0 SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO BRING THAT IN
H9eXrX31IJk_8 0 YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH SIDE OF THE FOIL YOU WANT TO USE BUT I LIKE TO USE THIS SIDE BECAUSE IT HOLDS PAINT A LITTLE BIT BETTER
H9eXrX31IJk_9 0 WE'RE GOING TO BRING THIS IN KEEPING OUR HAND ON THE INSIDE OF THE FOIL PUSHING DOWN BECAUSE WE WANT A LITTLE FLATTER SURFACE FOR THE INSIDE THE UNDERSIDE OF THE TOP PART OF THE SHELL
H9eXrX31IJk_10 0 THEN WE CAN TURN IT OVER
H9eXrX31IJk_11 0 IF WE PRESS IT DOWN IT GIVES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE ROUNDED AFFECT ON THE TOP AND A FLATTER INSIDE WHICH WILL GO AGAINST THE UNDER BODY AND ALSO KEEP THE LIMBS HEAD AND TAIL ALL IN PLACE
GKGjqxwFx3o_2 0 LET'S GO OVER A TIME SIGNATURE WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER FOUR FOURTHS
GKGjqxwFx3o_3 0 NOW THIS IS WHAT A TIME SIGNATURE LOOKS LIKE
GKGjqxwFx3o_4 0 RIGHT HERE FOUR FOURTH
GKGjqxwFx3o_5 0 NOW YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHAT IS FOUR FOURTH MEAN
GKGjqxwFx3o_6 0 WELL FOUR FOURTH MEANS THERE'S THE TOP FOUR THAT NUMBER
GKGjqxwFx3o_7 0 THAT MEANS THERE'S FOUR BEATS IN A MEASURE
GKGjqxwFx3o_8 0 SO YOU HAVE THESE QUARTER NOTES
GKGjqxwFx3o_9 0 ONE TWO THREE FOUR AND THE BOTTOM FOUR IS THE QUARTER NOTE GETS THE BEAT HENCE FOUR BEATS IN THAT MEASURE
GKGjqxwFx3o_10 0 SO THE QUARTER NOTE GETS THAT ONE BEAT
GKGjqxwFx3o_11 0 SO YOU GOT ONE TWO THREE FOUR
GKGjqxwFx3o_12 0 SO FOUR BEATS IN A MEASURE
GKGjqxwFx3o_14 0 AND SO AS YOU GET ON TO OTHER NOTES WHICH WE'LL DEAL WITH LATER ON LIKE EIGHTH NOTES SIXTEENTH NOTES THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT VALUES TIME VALUES
GKGjqxwFx3o_15 0 BUT SO IF THIS IS THE QUARTER NOTE ONE TWO THREE FOUR AND I WANT TO PLAY QUARTER NOTES ON THE SNARE IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME
GlzfDsDCdIs_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER ALL THE DIFFERENT STYLES OF BOARDS YOU CAN USE FOR KITE SURFING
GlzfDsDCdIs_2 0 KITE SURFING AGAIN IS ONE OF THE MOST VERSATILE SPORTS IN THE ENTIRE WATER SPORTS INDUSTRY
GlzfDsDCdIs_3 0 YOU CAN TAKE ASPECTS FROM MANY DIFFERENT SPORTS LIKE WINDSURFING WAKEBOARDING OR EVEN JUST SURFING
GlzfDsDCdIs_4 0 AND BASICALLY APPLY THEM DIRECTLY TO KITE SURFING
GlzfDsDCdIs_5 0 YOU'RE JUST GOING TO DO THE SAME THING THAT YOU WOULD WITH THAT BOARD IN THE OTHER SPORT BUT NOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE GETTING PULLED BY A KITE RATHER THAN THE OTHER OBJECT
GlzfDsDCdIs_6 0 THE DIFFERENT GENRES OF KITEBOARDING FOR INSTANCE ARE FREE RIDE KITE SURFING WHERE YOU'RE ACTUALLY USING LIKE A SURFBOARD
GlzfDsDCdIs_7 0 HERE IS SOMETHING STRAPLESS
GlzfDsDCdIs_8 0 OR YOU KNOW YOU COULD DO WAKE STYLE RIDING WHERE YOU'RE TRYING DO TO HIGH TECHNICAL MANEUVERS THAT ARE BASICALLY YOU KNOW THE SAME AS YOU WOULD DO IN WAKEBOARDING BUT YOU'RE DOING WITH A KITE
GlzfDsDCdIs_9 0 THERE'S A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT YOU CAN USE HERE
GlzfDsDCdIs_10 0 WE CAN USE SANDAL STRAP BINDINGS LIKE THIS WHICH IS REALLY GOOD FOR KITE SURFING BECAUSE IN THE EVENT THAT YOU GET WHAT WE CALL TEABAGGED WHICH IS WHERE THE KITE ACTUALLY PICKS YOU UP AND DUNKS YOU THESE SANDAL STRAP BINDINGS ALLOW YOU TO REALLY EJECT FROM THE BOARD FAST TO PROTECT YOUR KNEES
GlzfDsDCdIs_11 0 BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE GETTING DRAGGED THROUGH THE WATER WITH YOU KNOW SOME WAKEBOARDING STYLE BINDING ATTACHED TO YOUR LEG AND CAUSING YOUR KNEES TO BLOW OUT
GlzfDsDCdIs_12 0 SO DIFFERENT STYLES OF BOARD
GlzfDsDCdIs_13 0 EVERYTHING IS PERSONAL PREFERENCE
GlzfDsDCdIs_14 0 DON'T LET SOMEBODY TELL YOU YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD BE USING
GlzfDsDCdIs_15 0 DECIDE FOR YOURSELF
GlzfDsDCdIs_16 0 BOARDS LIKE THIS RIGHT HERE FOR INSTANCE HAVE A LOT OF FLEX TO IT
GlzfDsDCdIs_17 0 YOU KNOW YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT THERE IN THIS BOARD
GlzfDsDCdIs_18 0 IT'S GOING TO BE A REALLY SOFT RIDE
GlzfDsDCdIs_19 0 IT'S GOT SMALL FINS AND IT'S GOOD FOR GENERAL ALL AROUND FREE STYLE OR JUST GOING OUT TO FREE RIDE GET BIG AIR RIDE BACK AND FORTH
GlzfDsDCdIs_20 0 THEN YOU HAVE LIGHT WIND SPECIFIC BOARDS
GlzfDsDCdIs_21 0 OR IF YOU'RE A BIGGER GUY YOU NEED A LITTLE BIGGER BOARD THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE DISPLACEMENT WITH A BOARD LIKE THIS
GlzfDsDCdIs_22 0 YOU CAN SEE THE GENERAL SURFACE AREA ESPECIALLY THE WIDTH
GlzfDsDCdIs_23 0 IT'S A LOT LARGER

gBT_ktNuc-4_1 0 HI IT'S DOW HERE DOWN AT THE FIREHOUSE DETAIL CENTER
gBT_ktNuc-4_2 0 TODAY WE'RE DETAILING THE EXTERIOR OF A CAR AND TEACHING YOU HOW TO DO IT LIKE A PRO
gBT_ktNuc-4_3 0 THERE IS NOTHING THAT LOOKS BETTER ON A CAR THAN BRIGHT SHINY CHROME
gBT_ktNuc-4_4 0 IT'S THE BLING BLING THAT WE PAY SO MUCH FOR
gBT_ktNuc-4_5 0 IN ORDER TO BRING IT BACK TO LIFE AND MAKE IT HAVE A DEEP LUSTER AND BRIGHT SHINE THERE'S SEVERAL PRODUCTS WE CAN USE
gBT_ktNuc-4_6 0 WE HAVE A METAL POLISH HERE THAT WE USE TO PUT ON CHROME PARTICULARLY CHROME THAT MAYBE IS A LITTLE BIT OXIDIZED MAYBE IT'S GOT SOME DIRT ON IT
gBT_ktNuc-4_7 0 THIS ACTUALLY HAS A SMALL ABRASIVE IN IT
gBT_ktNuc-4_8 0 WE'RE GOING TO GO IN AND JUST KIND OF MAKE THE CHROME SPARKLE AND SHINE
gBT_ktNuc-4_9 0 AFTER WE WORK IT IN WE BRING IT UP TO A BRIGHT SHINE WITH A MICROFIBER TOWEL AND IT JUST LOOKS EXCEPTIONAL
gBT_ktNuc-4_10 0 OF COURSE A WHEEL LIKE THIS IS GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME AND WORK THAT'S OUR JOB TO MAKE IT LOOK GREAT
gBT_ktNuc-4_11 0 IF YOU DON'T HAVE METAL POLISH AROUND A GOOD WAX WILL ALSO USUALLY DO A REALLY GOOD JOB OF BRINGING CHROME BACK TO FINISH
gBT_ktNuc-4_12 0 I LIKE TO USE WAX ON CHROME BUMPERS ON WHEELS PARTICULARLY IN A HARSH ENVIRONMENT HERE LIKE WE'RE IN UTAH THERE'S A LOT OF SALT AND ROAD GRIME THAT HAS A TENDENCY TO ATTACK AND WORK ON THE CHROME SO IT ACTUALLY LEAVES A PROTECTIVE COAT AND FINISH ON THE CHROME
gBT_ktNuc-4_13 0 NOT ONLY DOES IT SHINE IT UP BRIGHT BUT IT LEAVES IT WITH AN EXTRA PROTECTION LAYER SO THAT IT DOESN'T DESTROY AND EAT THROUGH THE CHROME
gBT_ktNuc-4_14 0 SALT OF COURSE CAN BE VERY ABRASIVE
gBT_ktNuc-4_15 0 IF YOU REALLY WANT THE CAR TO LOOK GREAT YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE CHROME
gBT_ktNuc-4_16 0 MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CLEAN MAKE SURE THAT YOU'VE POLISHED IT UP
gBT_ktNuc-4_17 0 MY FAVORITE THING TO POLISH CHROME WITH
gBT_ktNuc-4_19 0 WHETHER IT'S THE TRIM ON THE SIDE OF THE CAR OR EVEN THE LETTERS YOU KNOW YOU CAN REALLY MAKE CHROME LOOK GREAT
gBT_ktNuc-4_20 0 THAT'S THE ICING ON THE CAKE IT MAKES THE CUSTOMERS DELIGHTED
gdohkzoMYXU_1 0 OKAY SO NOW I'VE COMPLETED MY SPRAY I WANT TO DO MY CLEANUP IMMEDIATELY THAT'S MY NEXT STEP
gdohkzoMYXU_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO START BY TURNING THE COMPRESSOR OFF
gdohkzoMYXU_3 0 IF YOU HAVE YOUR CAN YOU KNOW THE AEROSOL CAN AND THERE'S STILL SOME PRODUCT LEFT IN IT YOU NEED TO CLEAN THAT RIGHT AWAY
gdohkzoMYXU_4 0 IF THAT NOZZLE GETS CLOGGED YOU HAVE TO THROW THE REST OF IT AWAY
gdohkzoMYXU_5 0 SAME WORKS FOR THE SPRAYER WE HAVE TO CLEAN THIS RIGHT AWAY
gdohkzoMYXU_6 0 AND JUST WATER ALL YOU DO IS JUST CLEAN IT WITH WATER WARM WATER WORKS WELL
gdohkzoMYXU_7 0 IF YOU'VE ACTUALLY SPRAYED YOURSELF DON'T GET YOUR HANDS WET SO I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU HOW TO DO THAT BUT DON'T GET YOUR HANDS WET
gdohkzoMYXU_8 0 SO I CAN'T IMAGINE DOING THIS YOURSELF
gdohkzoMYXU_9 0 YOU NEED SOMEONE TO HELP YOU WITH THAT CLEANUP A PERSON TO GET WET AND A PERSON TO NOT GET WET
gdohkzoMYXU_10 0 SO I HAVE ACTUALLY RINSED EVERYTHING OFF TURNED MY COMPRESSOR OFF AND IF YOU HAVE WORKED WITH THE CAN YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CLEAN THAT AS WELL SPRAY IT OFF UNDER WATER AND CLEAN THE NOZZLE OUT REALLY WELL ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE SOME LEFT OVER AND YOU DON'T WANT TO THROW IT AWAY

grhjcXNayy0_1 0 HI I'M ANN MYRICK AND TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PLACE LIVING ROOM FURNITURE
grhjcXNayy0_2 0 THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS YOU'D THINK ABOUT BUT I AM NOT A RULE PERSON
grhjcXNayy0_3 0 I REALLY LIKE TO I'M A DECORATOR AND I REALLY LIKE TO BREAK THE RULES AND JUST CREATE SOMETHING DIFFERENT
grhjcXNayy0_4 0 THINK OUT OF THE BOX AND NOT HAVE JUST YOUR NORMAL LIVING ROOM
grhjcXNayy0_5 0 THIS IS A VERY SMALL SPACE AND THE WAY THE REASON WHY WE CREATED IT THIS WAY IS IT GIVES YOU A GOOD ONE THING YOU ALWAYS WANT TO THINK ABOUT IN PLACING YOUR FURNITURE IS CONVERSATION AREA
grhjcXNayy0_6 0 SO I CAN HAVE THREE PEOPLE SITTING ON THE COUCH AND THEN TWO PEOPLE CAN BE HERE
grhjcXNayy0_7 0 WHAT I LIKE TO DO A LOT OF TIMES IF THERE IS ANOTHER AREA RIGHT OUTSIDE THIS ROOM WHERE I CAN PUT ANOTHER CHAIR
grhjcXNayy0_8 0 THERE'S A LITTLE ANTIQUE CHAIR THAT I CAN BRING IN SO I CAN CREATE A LITTLE BIT MORE SEATING AREA
grhjcXNayy0_9 0 ON YOUR WHEN YOU WORK WITH PLACEMENT I ALWAYS TRY TO WORK WITH EACH CHAIR HAVING A PLACE TO PUT A CUP OF COFFEE
grhjcXNayy0_10 0 IF THE PERSON IS SITTING HERE THEY CAN PUT THEIR COFFEE HERE
grhjcXNayy0_11 0 THE PERSON SITTING HERE CAN PUT THEIR COFFEE HERE OR HERE
grhjcXNayy0_12 0 SO EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM WILL HAVE A PLACE TO PUT A PLATE PUT A CUP OF COFFEE IF THEY'RE DRINKING ANYTHING
grhjcXNayy0_13 0 YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT LIGHTS
grhjcXNayy0_14 0 YOU WANT LIGHTS THAT ARE WELL YOU REALLY WANT A VARIETY OF LIGHTS
grhjcXNayy0_15 0 I HAVE TWO IDENTICAL LIGHTS ON EACH TABLE THAT GIVE ME A HEIGHT WITH A BRIGHT LAMP TO BRING IN LIGHT
grhjcXNayy0_16 0 I DON'T HAVE AN OVERHEAD SO I HAVE TWO LARGER LAMPS ON THE TABLES
grhjcXNayy0_17 0 AND THEN THIS IS MORE OF A MOOD LIGHT WITH A BLACK SHADE
grhjcXNayy0_18 0 YOU DON'T GET A LOT OF LIGHT OUT OF IT
grhjcXNayy0_19 0 IT REALLY CREATES MOOD AND GIVES YOU A NICE LITTLE LIGHT UNDER THE BLACK SHADE
grhjcXNayy0_20 0 IN PLACING THINGS ON YOUR COFFEE TABLE YOU WANT TO BE SURE IF SOMEBODY IS SITTING HERE YOU DON'T WANT TO BLOCK THEIR VISION AND SO YOU WANT TO PUT SOMETHING ON YOUR TABLE THAT'S KIND OF LOW
grhjcXNayy0_21 0 SO THOSE ARE THINGS TO THINK ABOUT IN PLACING YOUR FURNITURE
grhjcXNayy0_22 0 YOU DON'T WANT IT IN A SMALL SPACE YOU WANT TO BE CAREFUL
grhjcXNayy0_23 0 I THINK PEOPLE HAVE A TENDENCY TO PUT TOO MUCH FURNITURE IN A ROOM
grhjcXNayy0_24 0 SO YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT DO I HAVE TOO MUCH FURNITURE IN HERE
grhjcXNayy0_25 0 SO WORK WITH THAT BUT JUST PLAY WITH IT AND HAVE FUN
grhjcXNayy0_26 0 ADD TO IT TAKE IT AWAY AND AT SOME POINT YOU'LL GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU'LL REALLY LIKE IT

gqRVGJCFbaY_30 0 THANKS FOR JOINING
g-K8B4jQyjo_1 0 HI MY NAME IS LAUREN AND TODAY I'M HERE TO DISCUSS HOW TO GROW YOUR HAIR FASTER
g-K8B4jQyjo_2 0 ONE THING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR GROWING YOUR HAIR FASTER IS YOUR DAILY DIET AND YOUR VITAMIN REGIMEN
g-K8B4jQyjo_3 0 VITAMINS WILL HELP YOUR HAIR GROW
g-K8B4jQyjo_4 0 BIOTIN IS ACTUALLY VERY GREAT FOR ENHANCING YOUR HAIR GROWTH AND HAVING YOUR HAIR GROW FASTER
g-K8B4jQyjo_5 0 B VITAMINS ARE ALSO VERY GREAT IN HAVING YOUR HAIR GROW FASTER
g-K8B4jQyjo_6 0 THEY'RE ESSENTIAL TO HAIR GROWTH
g-K8B4jQyjo_7 0 YOU CAN FIND B VITAMINS WITHIN WHOLE GRAINS WHEAT EGG YOLKS MOST MEATS
g-K8B4jQyjo_8 0 YOU CAN ALSO TAKE VITAMINS THAT ARE SPECIALLY FORMULATED IN ORDER FOR YOUR HAIR AND NAILS TO GROW
g-K8B4jQyjo_9 0 MOST OF THOSE VITAMINS ARE FILLED WITH YOUR BIOTIN YOUR B VITAMINS AND OTHER VITAMINS SUCH AS VITAMIN E WHICH HELPS STIMULATE THE HAIR FOLLICLE
g-K8B4jQyjo_10 0 ANY STIMULATION THAT YOU CAN GET TO YOUR SCALP WILL ACTUALLY HELP BRING MORE BLOOD TO YOUR SCALP
g-K8B4jQyjo_11 0 ANOTHER GOOD THING FOR THIS IS SCALP MASSAGES
g-K8B4jQyjo_12 0 IF YOU WERE TO GET A SCALP MASSAGE WHICH IS USUALLY THE MOST NEGLECTED PART OF PEOPLE I THINK NOBODY REALLY MASSAGES THEIR SCALP
g-K8B4jQyjo_13 0 IF YOU MASSAGE YOUR SCALP YOU WILL THEN INCREASE THE BLOOD FLOW TO YOUR SCALP WHICH WILL THEN FEED YOUR PAPILLA THROUGH BLOOD
g-K8B4jQyjo_14 0 THE PAPILLA IS THE BASE OF YOUR HAIR FOLLICLE AND AS YOUR BLOOD PASSES THROUGH IT GRABS ALL THE NUTRIENTS IT NEEDS IN ORDER TO GROW YOUR HAIR
g-K8B4jQyjo_15 0 HEALTHY HAIR IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO HAVE YOUR HAIR GROW FASTER
g-K8B4jQyjo_16 0 USING VITAMINS AND SUPPLEMENTS AND HAVING A WELL ROUNDED DIET WILL HELP YOUR HAIR GROW FASTER HEALTHIER AND REMAIN WITH THE LUSTER THAT IT SHOULD HAVE AND THAT IS HOW TO HELP YOUR HAIR GROW FASTER
GOFFH6-NGkA_1 0 NOW THAT YOU GOT YOUR CLAY ROLLING YOU WANT TO START BRING IT IN ON IT'S SELF
GOFFH6-NGkA_4 0 THIS NEEDS TO GO UP SO THAT NEEDS TO GO DOWN AND NOW YOU HAVE A NICE BALL OF CLAY AND THAT SHOULD HAVE NO AIR BUBBLES IN IT AND THIS IS HOW YOU CHECK IT AND THIS IS HOW YOU GET BETTER AT WEDGING TOO
GOFFH6-NGkA_5 0 NOW BECAUSE NOW THAT I DO THAT I AM GOING TO HAVE TO REWEDGE ALL THAT
GOFFH6-NGkA_6 0 IT'S NOT A PROBLEM
GOFFH6-NGkA_7 0 OK YOU CAN SEE VERY CONSISTENT
GOFFH6-NGkA_8 0 THERE IS NO FOLDS
GOFFH6-NGkA_9 0 THAT'S THE TOP
GOFFH6-NGkA_10 0 THERE IS NO FOLDS
GOFFH6-NGkA_11 0 THERE'S NO AIR BUBBLES
GOFFH6-NGkA_12 0 TAKE A LITTLE GANDER AT IT AND YOU CAN SEE THE THAT THERE IS SOME INCONSISTENCY'S RIGHT THERE BUT THAT WILL BE FINE JUST TAKE IT GO LIKE THAT AND TAKE THAT AND WERE GOING TO JUST WEDGE IT UP OUT IT ON THE WHEEL
HJnVnbbzTjw_1 0 OKAY AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET HER OUT OF THE WAY EVEN IF THEY TAKE IT FINE
HJnVnbbzTjw_2 0 NOW THE ONLY THREAT CARD TO YOUR HAND IS THE THREE OF HEARTS
HJnVnbbzTjw_3 0 SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO NOW IS CATCH THE ACE OF DIAMONDS CATCH THE KING OF SPADES PLAY THE THREE OF HEARTS AND SAY THAT'S IT
HJnVnbbzTjw_5 0 AND LET THE OTHERS FIGHT
HJnVnbbzTjw_6 0 BECAUSE THE ONLY CARDS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE LEFT ARE THOSE TWO AND THIS ONE AND THIS ONE
HJnVnbbzTjw_7 0 SO BY THE TIME YOU'RE ON LEAD ALL YOU HAVE IS THOSE CARDS
HJnVnbbzTjw_8 0 YOU HAVE UNLOADED THE CLUB SUIT
HJnVnbbzTjw_9 0 YOU HAVE UNLOADED THE DIAMOND TOPS TOP
HJnVnbbzTjw_10 0 YOU'VE UNLOADED THE SPADE TOP
HJnVnbbzTjw_11 0 NOW ISN'T THAT JUST A WONDERFUL HAND TO BE ON LEAD WITH LAST TWO
HJnVnbbzTjw_12 0 AND YOU JUST PUSH THAT OUT AND EVEN IF THE DEUCE IS WITH ALL THE OTHER HEARTS
HJnVnbbzTjw_13 0 YOU'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO GET OFF LEAD WITH THIS
HJnVnbbzTjw_14 0 AND LET THE OTHERS FIGHT OVER THOSE FAT THIRTY POINTS BECAUSE NEGATIVE POINT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THEM
HJnVnbbzTjw_15 0 DO NOT CALL LAST TWO WITH HANDS THAT HAVE LOTS OF MIDDLE CARDS BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO GET ABSOLUTELY SMOKED IN THEM ABSOLUTELY SMOKED
HJnVnbbzTjw_16 0 HERE'S A HAND FOR EXAMPLE
HJnVnbbzTjw_17 0 IT'S KIND OF OUR STOCK TRADE HAND
HJnVnbbzTjw_18 0 WOULD YOU CALL LAST TWO WITH THAT HAND
HJnVnbbzTjw_21 0 HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ESCAPE THE LEAD
HJnVnbbzTjw_22 0 THERE'S JUST NO WAY TO GET OFF THAT HAND
HJnVnbbzTjw_23 0 YOU'VE GOT THE QUEEN OF HEARTS TEN OF HEARTS
HJnVnbbzTjw_24 0 I DON'T KNOW YOU START THAT OUT THEY'RE GOING TO THROW YOU BACK IN
HJnVnbbzTjw_25 0 YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BOTTOMS
HJnVnbbzTjw_26 0 YOU DON'T THINK THE FIVE OF SPADES IS GOING TO DO THE JOB DO YOU
HJnVnbbzTjw_27 0 YOU ARE GUARANTEED TO SOAK IN THIRTY POINTS IN THAT HAND FOR LAST TWO IT'S AN AWFUL HAND
HJnVnbbzTjw_28 0 IT'S AN AWFUL HAND FOR HEARTS
HJnVnbbzTjw_29 0 IT'S AN AWFUL HAND FOR NULLOWS
HJnVnbbzTjw_30 0 IT'S JUST BASICALLY AN AWFUL HAND
HJnVnbbzTjw_31 0 AND YOU DON'T GET A MULLIGAN IN THIS GAME
HJnVnbbzTjw_32 0 SO AGAIN LAST TWO YOU MUST HAVE THE DEUCES OR CARDS TO GET OFF LEAD TOWARD THE END OF THE HAND
HJnVnbbzTjw_33 0 THAT'S THE IDEA
HJnVnbbzTjw_34 0 YOU DON'T WANT LAST TWO

h4yPvfISDyA_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW OUR EMOTIONS AFFECT OUR DIET AND OUR HEALTH
h4yPvfISDyA_2 0 AND SO ALL THOUGH THIS IS A HUGE CATEGORY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW IT AFFECTS THE THINGS THAT WE EAT
h4yPvfISDyA_3 0 SO IN CHINESE MEDICINE WE LOOK AT THE FIVE ELEMENTS OR THE FIVE MAIN ORGANS
h4yPvfISDyA_4 0 THE HEART THE SPLEEN THE LUNG THE KIDNEY AND THE LIVER
h4yPvfISDyA_5 0 THEN EACH ONE OF THOSE ORGANS WE ACTUALLY RELATE AN EMOTION WITH
h4yPvfISDyA_6 0 SO WITH THE SPLEEN WHICH WE NOW IS ALL ABOUT OUR DIGESTION
h4yPvfISDyA_7 0 WE ASSOCIATE WORRY
h4yPvfISDyA_8 0 WITH THE LIVER ONE OF THE ORGANS THAT REALLY HAS A HUGE EFFECT ON OUR EMOTIONS THE BIG STUFF WE LOOK AT IS STRESS
h4yPvfISDyA_9 0 IN MIXED WITH THAT WE SEE DEPRESSION IRRITABILITY ANGER AND SO FORTH
h4yPvfISDyA_10 0 SO WHAT I TELL PEOPLE WHEN YOU'RE DIETING SO OFTEN WE WORRY ABOUT THE FOODS THAT WE EAT THAT WE HAD A SMALL SQUARE OF CHOCOLATE AND ALL THE SUDDEN WE HAVE ALL THIS GUILT AND WE WORRY ABOUT HOW ITS GOING TO AFFECT US
h4yPvfISDyA_11 0 THAT EMOTION OF WORRY WILL AFFECT THE WAY OUR SPLEEN FUNCTIONS
h4yPvfISDyA_12 0 WE SAY IT KNOTS OUR STOMACH UP SO THAT THE DIGESTION CAN'T AFFORD TO EXTRACT THAT ENERGY THAT CHI FROM IT
h4yPvfISDyA_13 0 IN THE SAY WAY THAT IF WE STRESS AND WE HAVE STRESS AT WORK STRESS IN OUR LIFE THAT WE'LL FIND THAT THERE'S AN INTERACTION BETWEEN BOTH THE LIVER AND THE SPLEEN THAT WILL CAUSE OUR DIGESTION AGAIN NOT TO BE GOOD
h4yPvfISDyA_14 0 AND SO WE KNOW THAT WE CAN BE SO STRESSED THAT WE ACTUALLY GET NAUSEOUS SOMETIMES
h4yPvfISDyA_15 0 WE FEEL OUR STOMACH KNOTTING UP
h4yPvfISDyA_16 0 SO IT S IMPORTANT THAT WHEN WE EAT WE ENJOY THE FOOD WE TRY TO CREATE A RESTFUL ENVIRONMENT AND THAT WE DON'T HAVE GUILT OVER THE FEW GUILTY PLEASURES THAT WE HAVE LIKE A SMALL PIECE OF CHOCOLATE OR A COOKIE
h4yPvfISDyA_17 0 WE JUST CAN'T DO IT CONSTANTLY AND ITS ALL ABOUT PORTION SIDE
h4yPvfISDyA_18 0 SO A SMALL PIECE OF CHOCOLATE NOT THE WHOLE CHOCOLATE BAR

hjEWPk9Ej_M_2 0 I ONLY NEED A HALF OF AN ONION AND I'M GOING TO USE THE OTHER HALF FOR THE NEXT APPETIZER WHICH IS THE STUFFED MUSHROOMS
hjEWPk9Ej_M_3 0 WHAT I DO WITH THIS ONION AFTER WE TAKE THIS PEEL OFF OF IT THE ONION SKIN IS WE WANT TO SLICE IT VERY THINLY
hjEWPk9Ej_M_4 0 THIS IS GOING TO GO INTO OUR QUESADILLA AS PART OF THE FILLING BECAUSE AS I SAID I THINK THAT RED ONION PARTICULARLY GOES REALLY WELL WITH BARBEQUE SAUCE
hjEWPk9Ej_M_5 0 SO WE WANT TO SLICE IT VERY THINLY BECAUSE IT'S GOING IN RAW AND WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE TOO OVERPOWERING AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO CHEW IT AS PART OF THE FILLING FOR OUR QUESADILLA
hjEWPk9Ej_M_6 0 SO WE WANT TO DO IT VERY THINLY
hjEWPk9Ej_M_7 0 SO I CUT IT IN HALF AND I'M ALMOST AS CLOSELY AS I CAN SHAVING THE ONION
hjEWPk9Ej_M_8 0 IT'S ALMOST LIKE A SHAVED RED ONION REALLY REALLY THIN
hjEWPk9Ej_M_9 0 THIS ALONG WITH THE TWO KINDS OF CHEESE AND THE CHICKEN AND THE BARBEQUE SAUCE ARE GOING TO MAKE UP THE FILLING
hjEWPk9Ej_M_10 0 WHEN WE COME BACK WE ARE GOING TO ASSEMBLE AND GRILL OUR QUESADILLAS
ggOK7FgqROs_1 0 SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT ARISE WITH BEING A MUSIC PRODUCER AND THERE ARE SOME MANY ACTUALLY ARE OBVIOUSLY TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD OF WHICH CAN BE ANYTHING FROM ONE MACHINE NOT TALKING TO ANOTHER MACHINE FOR WHO KNOWS WHY OR EGO DIFFICULTIES WITH ARTISTS WITH OTHER PRODUCERS
ggOK7FgqROs_2 0 SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT GO INTO MAKING A SESSION RUN SMOOTHLY
ggOK7FgqROs_3 0 NOW OTHER DIFFICULTIES THAT ARISE ARE A BUDGET AND HOW YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR ALL THIS STUFF FOR ALL THIS EQUIPMENT
ggOK7FgqROs_4 0 YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE OUT A LOAN OR YOU'RE GOING TO BORROW MONEY FROM YOUR RELATIVES HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FIRST GET EVERYTHING GOING
ggOK7FgqROs_5 0 SOME OTHER DIFFICULTIES IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY IS THE FACT THAT A LOT OF MUSIC UNFORTUNATELY ISN'T SUCCESSFUL
ggOK7FgqROs_6 0 A LOT OF ARTISTS ARE OUT THERE AND THEY'RE TRYING BUT MAYBE THEY'RE NOT MARKETED RIGHT OR MAYBE THE MANAGEMENT ISN'T RIGHT OR MAYBE THEY'RE NOT ON TOUR OR MAYBE THEIR MUSIC ISN'T THAT GOOD
ggOK7FgqROs_7 0 SO AS A PRODUCER YOU REALLY NEED TO PICK AND CHOOSE WHO YOU WORK WITH AND A LOT OF TIMES THERE'S NO WAY TO REALLY TELL WHAT'S GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL WHAT'S NOT GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO IT'S SORT OF A GAMBLE ON EACH PROJECT WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO GET PAID IF IT'S GOING TO BE A SUCCESS
ggOK7FgqROs_8 0 THAT'S WHY A LOT OF PRODUCERS JUST WANT TO GET PAID UP FRONT AND DON'T EVEN WANT TO DEAL WITH THE STUFF ON THE BACK END
ggOK7FgqROs_9 0 SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT
ggOK7FgqROs_10 0 ANOTHER HARD THING TO DEAL WITH THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED MYSELF A LOT IS ALL THE LONG HOURS
ggOK7FgqROs_11 0 NOW IF YOU'RE A MUSIC PRODUCER YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE A BUDGET TO HIRE AN ENGINEER TO HIRE SOMEBODY ELSE TO CLEAN UP THE TRACK TO ARRANGE IT SO YOU HAVE TO DO ALL THESE THINGS
ggOK7FgqROs_12 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE SPENDING ON ONE TRACK POSSIBLY THIRTY HOURS
gh0vsBwlJcQ_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT A FAMILY MEMBER CAN DO TO HELP A PERSON WHO'S SUFFERING FROM OCD
gh0vsBwlJcQ_2 0 ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO KNOW AS A FAMILY MEMBER IS WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP
gh0vsBwlJcQ_3 0 ONE OF THE ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION IS GET INFORMED
gh0vsBwlJcQ_4 0 LEARN WHAT OCD IS LEARN WHAT SOME OF THE THINGS ARE THAT YOU CAN DO
gh0vsBwlJcQ_5 0 KIND OF INFORM YOURSELF AS TO WHAT KIND OF TREATMENT YOUR FAMILY MEMBER IS RECEIVING
gh0vsBwlJcQ_6 0 NOW IF THEY ARE NOT EVEN RECEIVING TREATMENT THEN ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO IS HELP THEM FIGURE OUT IF TREATMENT IS NECESSARY AND IF THEY HAVE OCD THEN THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS YES THEY DO NEED TREATMENT
gh0vsBwlJcQ_7 0 IF THEY'RE OPEN ENOUGH TO HAVE YOU GO WITH THEM TO THE DOCTOR IT'S HELPFUL BECAUSE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THAT PERSON
gh0vsBwlJcQ_8 0 YOU KNOW THEM YOU LOVE THEM YOU MAY BE ABLE TO TELL THEM WHAT ARE SOME OF THINGS THAT YOU'VE NOTICE TRIGGER SOME OF THEIR BEHAVIORS
gh0vsBwlJcQ_9 0 YOU MIGHT HAVE A BETTER ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE A PARENT YOU MIGHT HAVE A BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR MEDICAL BACKGROUND ANY KIND OF MAJOR EVENTS
gh0vsBwlJcQ_10 0 AGAIN OCD CAN BE CAUSED BY A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENTAL
gh0vsBwlJcQ_11 0 ESPECIALLY IF IT'S AN ENVIRONMENTAL TRIGGER YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO NOTICE A LOT MORE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND AROUND THEM
gh0vsBwlJcQ_12 0 AGAIN IT'S NOT CAUSED BY A SPECIFIC TRAUMATIC EVENT LIKE PTSD IS BUT BY OTHER FACTORS
gh0vsBwlJcQ_13 0 AS A FAMILY MEMBER YOU MIGHT NEED SOME SUPPORT AS WELL
gh0vsBwlJcQ_14 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE HELPFUL BUT NOT TO THE POINT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL OR BECOMING OVERBEARING BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT OCD IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL LOSES EVERY SENSE OF CONTROL THAT THEY HAVE OR THEY HAD VERY LITTLE CONTROL
gh0vsBwlJcQ_15 0 SO ACTUALLY IF YOU TAKE OVER AND YOU TRY AND TAKE CONTROL FROM THEM YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY WORSEN THEIR SYMPTOMS
gh0vsBwlJcQ_16 0 SO BE THERE BE LOVING BE SUPPORTIVE GET INFORMED AND LISTEN TO THEM
gh0vsBwlJcQ_17 0 THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO REALLY HELP A PERSON WHO YOU LOVE OR CARE ABOUT THAT HAS OCD
gVWwiZSuIK0_1 0 ANDRE BOULAY SO THE NEXT TRICK WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON IS CALLED A BRAIN TWISTER OFF STRING MOUNT
gVWwiZSuIK0_2 0 IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A TRICK
gVWwiZSuIK0_3 0 IT'S JUST A MOUNT REALLY
gVWwiZSuIK0_4 0 IT'S A WAY TO GET END TO DOING TRICKS
gVWwiZSuIK0_5 0 WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING WITH IT IS YOU'RE THROWING THE YOYO DOWN WHICH SEEMS REALLY WEIRD CAUSE YOU'RE LIKE WELL IT'S JUST GOING TO COME RIGHT OFF THE STRING
gVWwiZSuIK0_6 0 WHAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO IS YOU'RE THROWING IT DOWN AND AS IT'S COMING DOWN YOU PINCH THE STRING AND PULL YOUR THROW HAND UNDERNEATH THE YOYO
gVWwiZSuIK0_7 0 SO LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
gVWwiZSuIK0_8 0 YOU THROW AND YOU'LL NOTICE HOW MY HAND QUICKLY JUST CAME RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE YOYO
gVWwiZSuIK0_9 0 YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO WATCH THIS A FEW TIMES TO GET THE FEEL FOR IT
gVWwiZSuIK0_10 0 SO ONE MORE TIME I START FROM HERE I THROW DOWN
gVWwiZSuIK0_11 0 AS IT'S COMING DOWN I BRING MY HAND RIGHT UNDERNEATH IT AND IT LANDS ACTUALLY ON THE STRING AND IT'S ACTUALLY SPINNING BACKWARDS
gVWwiZSuIK0_12 0 SO YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO BIND THE OPPOSITE WAY TO GET BACK TO YOUR HAND
gVWwiZSuIK0_13 0 LET ME BREAK IT DOWN A REAL QUICK AND SHOW YOU WHAT'S HAPPENING
gVWwiZSuIK0_14 0 AS THE YOYO'S COMING DOWN AS I THROW IT I'M PINCHING HERE AND I'M QUICKLY BRINGING MY THROW HAND WHICH IS THIS HAND HERE RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE YOYO
gVWwiZSuIK0_15 0 SO AS THE YOYO FALLS JUST BEFORE IT FALLS IT HITS ON TO THAT STRING AND I LAND THE YOYO LIKE SO
gVWwiZSuIK0_16 0 SO ONE MORE TIME YOU THROW YOYO'S IN YOUR HAND LIKE THAT
gVWwiZSuIK0_17 0 IT COMES OFF
gVWwiZSuIK0_18 0 YOU GRAB THE STRING OVER HERE AND PINCH AND BRING YOUR HAND UNDERNEATH IT REAL QUICK
gVWwiZSuIK0_19 0 SO YOU PINCH WITH YOUR NON-THROW HAND BRING COME DOWN UNDER WITH YOUR THROW HAND
gVWwiZSuIK0_20 0 THAT'S A BRAIN TWISTER OFF STRING MOUNT
gVWwiZSuIK0_21 0 PRACTICE THAT AND YOU'LL BE GOOD TO GO
gjgHQhJvbHo_1 0 SO NOW WE'RE ON WHAT THEY CALL THE INTEROSY OK
gjgHQhJvbHo_2 0 I THINK IT'S CALLED THE INTEROSSEI
gjgHQhJvbHo_3 0 INTEROSSEI OK AND SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT MEANS LIKE INTERIOR OK AND SO THAT THESE MUSCLES INSIDE OF THE TOES
gjgHQhJvbHo_4 0 IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHAT SEPARATES THE TOES TOGETHER
gjgHQhJvbHo_5 0 BECAUSE REALLY IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY MUSCLES OR ANYTHING THERE THE TOES WOULD KIND OF JUST BE ALL LOOSE AND EVERYTHING IN THERE
gjgHQhJvbHo_6 0 SO THE INTEROSSEI IS ALL IN BETWEEN THE TOES OK ALL IN THERE ALL BETWEEN EVERY TOE THERE'S INTEROSSEI OK YOU HAVE A DORSAL WHICH IS LIKE DORSAL FLEXION AND PLANTAR FLEXION
gjgHQhJvbHo_7 0 SO YOU HAVE ONE ON THE TOP THAT ALLOWS YOU TO POINT YOUR TOES DOWN
gjgHQhJvbHo_8 0 AND YOU HAVE ONE ON THE TOP THAT ALLOWS YOU TO KIND OF BRING TOGETHER AND POINT THEM UP OK DORSI PLANTAR
gjgHQhJvbHo_9 0 THEY CALL THAT FLEXION WHEN YOU MOVE IT SORT OF LIKE A FOOT YOU KNOW FLEXIBILITY FLEXION AND INTEROSSEI ONCE AGAIN IS IN BETWEEN OK
gjgHQhJvbHo_10 0 SO THAT'S ANOTHER MUSCLE THAT IS VERY PROFOUND IN THE FOOT
G7w2dIsKnnI_1 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO POT A PLANT
G7w2dIsKnnI_2 0 BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT I'D LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHEN TO POT A PLANT

G7w2dIsKnnI_7 0 IT'S IN A HANGING BASKET TYPE OF CONTAINER WHEN THERE'S NO REASON FOR IT TO BE HUNG UP
G7w2dIsKnnI_8 0 IT NEEDS TO JUST BE IN A REGULAR CONTAINER

HJ2rO9eSkmQ_6 0 YOU CAN DROP THAT ONE ROPE DOWN TAKE ONE ROPE AND DO THE SAME THING
HJ2rO9eSkmQ_7 0 SO YOU COULD DO TWO HANDS WITH ONE ROPE
HJ2rO9eSkmQ_8 0 SO NOW YOU'RE STILL GETTING THE EFFECT OF THE EXERCISE WITHOUT TAKING QUITE SO MUCH WEIGHT

gGBTIFyk-Cc_3 0 IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT FROM THE HUMP
gGBTIFyk-Cc_4 0 THAT'S LIKE THE SMALLEST AMOUNT OF CLAY AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO CUT DOWN THE SMALLEST AMOUNT OF CLAY TO MAKE IT EVEN SMALLER

H0jzFiEhqsE_3 0 NOW WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN TYPE A AND THAT'S GOING TO OPEN UP THESE LITTLE WINDOWS
H0jzFiEhqsE_4 0 NOW WHEN YOU OPEN THAT UP THE FIRST THING THAT POPS UP IS THE VOLUME
H0jzFiEhqsE_5 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WE'RE GOING GO TO READ
H0jzFiEhqsE_6 0 AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO IS DO IS WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE CERTAIN THINGS WITHIN HERE
H0jzFiEhqsE_7 0 MAYBE JUST CHANGE ADD A ZERO THERE ADD A ZERO THERE BRING IT DOWN
H0jzFiEhqsE_8 0 GET ANOTHER ZERO BRING IT BACK UP TO RIGHT HERE TO WHERE THE LOOP STARTS BACK UP AGAIN
H0jzFiEhqsE_9 0 AND LISTEN TO OUR TRACK
H0jzFiEhqsE_11 0 SO YOU SEE THAT WE JUST DREW IN A VOLUME CHANGE AND AS THE SONG PLAYS ONCE IT GETS TO THAT POINT IT'S GOING TO START FADING DOWN AND THEN ONCE IT GOES BACK TO THE NEXT LOOP IT GOES RIGHT BACK UP TO ZERO
gqe84LTCmiw_1 0 SO ON THE TOP OF THE TUNERS ON THE GUITARS YOU CAN SEE HERE THERE'S A TUNER COVER

gqe84LTCmiw_6 0 AND YOU LINE IT UP BY JUST LOOKING MAKING SURE THAT IT'S NOT TOO BIG
gqe84LTCmiw_7 0 BECAUSE IF IT'S BIGGER THAN THAT HOLE THEN IT'S REALLY JUST GOING TO BE LOOSE AND IT'S GOING TO FALL OUT
gqe84LTCmiw_8 0 BUT IF IT'S JUST ABOUT THE EXACT SAME SIZE A LITTLE BIT SMALLER IT'S GOING TO FIT REALLY SNUG IN THERE

gyVqLn_aC1g_2 0 STARTING OFF WITH A 7/16THS NUT DRIVER
gyVqLn_aC1g_3 0 ALL THE TROPHIES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE INCORPORATED USING A QUARTER TWENTY ROD AND A 7/16THS X NUT
gyVqLn_aC1g_4 0 SO EVERYTHING IS PUT TOGETHER USING THESE TOOLS AND ALL OF THE TOOLS ARE JOINED TOGETHER WITH THIS ROD AND THEY'RE TIGHTENED UP USING THIS NUT
gyVqLn_aC1g_5 0 THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT PARTS INVOLVED BUT THEY'RE BASICALLY ALL PUT TOGETHER IN THE SAME FASHION
gyVqLn_aC1g_6 0 AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A TOP AND A COLUMN AND A BOTTOM
gyVqLn_aC1g_7 0 AND THEY'RE ALL PUT TOGETHER USING A ROD THAT RUNS DOWN THE CENTER OF THE TROPHY
gyVqLn_aC1g_8 0 IT'S BASICALLY COMBINED OF DIFFERENT PARTS
gyVqLn_aC1g_9 0 WE'LL USE A SCREWDRIVER CARTON KNIFE A PAIR OF PLIERS AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE NEED IS A RULER BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO KNOW HOW LONG THE DIFFERENT PARTS ARE BECAUSE WE'LL MAKE THE TROPHIES IN DIFFERENT SIZES

GPt8Z18WZnw_20 0 I'VE GOT SOME JEANS HERE
GPt8Z18WZnw_21 0 WHEN YOU TAKE THEM OUT OF THE DRYER THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE INSIDE OUT BECAUSE YOU WASH THEM INSIDE OUT TO RETAIN THE COLOR SO YOU'LL TURN THOSE RIGHT SIDE IN OR RIGHT SIDE OUT
GPt8Z18WZnw_22 0 WITH JEANS BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE CREASES YOU KNOW JUST ONE SOLID CREASE IN YOUR JEAN
GPt8Z18WZnw_23 0 THE BEST THING TO DO IS TAKE THE BOTTOM

GPt8Z18WZnw_25 0 TAKE THE TOP
GPt8Z18WZnw_26 0 FOLD IT OVER THAT AND THEN YOU WON'T HAVE A SOLID CREASE ANYMORE

GPt8Z18WZnw_32 0 ANOTHER WAY OF FOLDING T-SHIRTS IS CALLED THE JAPANESE WAY OF FOLDING T-SHIRTS
GPt8Z18WZnw_33 0 WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS SPREAD OUT YOUR T-SHIRT ON A TABLE AND YOU'RE GOING TO DRAW AN IMAGINARY LINE BETWEEN THE SLEEVE AND THE NECK OF YOUR SHIRT
GPt8Z18WZnw_34 0 YOU WANT TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT
GPt8Z18WZnw_35 0 DRAW AN IMAGINARY LINE DOWN THERE
GPt8Z18WZnw_36 0 YOU'RE GOING TO GRAB THE MIDDLE OF YOUR SHIRT HERE THE MIDDLE OF THE SHIRT THERE
GPt8Z18WZnw_37 0 THEN YOU'RE GOING TO WITH YOUR LEFT HAND GRAB AT THE SAME LINE THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE SHIRT SO NOT THE CORNER OF THE SHIRT BUT FOLLOWING THAT LINE THEN YOU LIFT IT UP AND ROTATE YOUR HANDS OUT
GPt8Z18WZnw_38 0 LAY IT DOWN ON THE COUNTER

gkca_lcbdS4_9 0 SO THAT WHOLE STACK OF BRICKS RIGHT THERE IS THE DOOR AND THAT TAKES QUIET A WHILE
HDsCNrtgSrk_1 0 HI THIS IS JON AND IN THIS CLIP I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT USING SHARP BLADES
HDsCNrtgSrk_2 0 BEFORE YOU PERFORM ANY CUTTING TASK YOU ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BLADE ON YOUR PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IS SHARP AND IN PROPER WORKING CONDITION
HDsCNrtgSrk_3 0 IF THE BLADE IS DULL THE WOODWORKER IS GOING TO HAVE TO WORK HARDER TO MAKE THE CUT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PUSH THAT BOARD IN JUST A LITTLE BIT HARDER AND THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT THE BLADE WILL BIND THE PIECE OF WOOD WILL KICK BACK OR POTENTIALLY THE BLADE WILL EVEN BREAK LIKE ON THIS THIN BLADE ON THIS SCROLL SAW
HDsCNrtgSrk_4 0 ADDITIONALLY IF YOU HAVE A SHARP BLADE YOU'RE GOING TO PRODUCE A MUCH CLEANER FASTER BETTER LOOKING CUT
HDsCNrtgSrk_5 0 NOW THIS ALSO GOES FOR SANDPAPER YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR SANDPAPER ON YOUR SANDING MACHINE HAS A GOOD STRONG GRIT ON IT
HDsCNrtgSrk_6 0 IF IT'S WORN DOWN TOO MUCH IT WILL JUST POLISH AND BUFF AND POTENTIALLY BURN THE PROJECT THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON
HDsCNrtgSrk_7 0 NOW EVEN WITH LATHE-TYPE TOOLS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BLADES ON THOSE ARE SHARP AS WELL
HDsCNrtgSrk_8 0 AS YOU'RE WORKING ON THE LATHE IF YOU DO HAVE A DULL BLADE AGAIN IT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU A BAD CUT BUT ALSO THERE'S MORE OF A CHANCE OF IT GETTING CAUGHT ON THE WOOD AND KICKING THAT BACK AT YOU
HDsCNrtgSrk_9 0 NOW EVEN TOOLS AS SIMPLE AS A CHISEL IF THE BLADE IS DULL IT WILL CAUSE YOU TO WORK A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO MAKE THAT CUT AND IT MIGHT POTENTIALLY SLIP AND COULD CAUSE YOU INJURY
GoV9Ng9VBIM_1 0 JOHN VANDEBROOKE THIS IS JOHN VANDEBROOKE AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I AM INVITING YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR SERIES OF INTERMEDIATE STAGES OF ENCAUSTIC PAINTING
GoV9Ng9VBIM_2 0 I HAVE A FAVORITE PHRASE THAT GETS ME GOING IN ALL KINDS OF DIRECTION
GoV9Ng9VBIM_3 0 IT GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF AND THEN I WONDER WHERE THAT LITTLE THOUGHT TAKES ME AND IN THIS CASE IT GOT ME THINKING ABOUT HOW COULD I MULTIPLY THE TOOLS THAT I HAVE TO MAKE MANY MORE TOOLS OUT OF THE ONE TOOL
GoV9Ng9VBIM_4 0 AND WHAT GOT ME THINKING WAS WHAT IF I TOOK A PIECE OF COPPER FOIL THAT YOU CAN GET AT A CRAFT STORE
GoV9Ng9VBIM_5 0 IT COMES IN DIFFERENT THICKNESSES USUALLY IN A ROLL IN A TUBE AND YOU'D UNROLL IT LAY IT OUT AND I TOOK THE IRON AND I LAID IT DOWN ON TOP OF THE COPPER AND I TRACED AROUND IT WITH A PENCIL AND THIS IS SO THIN THAT YOU CAN CUT IT WITH A PAIR OF SCISSORS
GoV9Ng9VBIM_6 0 SO AFTER I CUT IT I MADE SURE I LEFT LITTLE TABS AROUND THE PATTERN SO THAT WHEN I PUT THE IRON ON HERE I COULD THEN JUST SNAP IT RIGHT ON TO THE IRON
GoV9Ng9VBIM_7 0 WHAT WAS CLEVER ABOUT THIS IS THAT THIS COPPER IS SO SOFT YOU CAN SCOUR THE COPPER WITH A TOOL
GoV9Ng9VBIM_8 0 IT'S CALLED EMBOSSING
GoV9Ng9VBIM_9 0 SO YOU CAN EMBOSS PATTERNS ONTO THE PLATE AND THEY WILL SHOW UP ON THE OTHER SIDE SO THAT WHEN YOU'RE USING THE IRON WITH THE WAX AND YOU'RE LAYING DOWN AND PICKING IT UP YOU'RE GETTING THIS LITTLE PATTERN TRANSFERRED ONTO THE WAX
GoV9Ng9VBIM_10 0 NOW A HANDY LITTLE THING IS THIS THAT I THINK I SAID BEFORE THAT THIS LITTLE PEN POINT IF YOU DROP IT YOU'LL MESS UP THE POINT AND IT'LL BEND LIKE THIS ONE HAPPENS TO BE BENT
GoV9Ng9VBIM_11 0 AND INSTEAD OF THROWING IT AWAY I TOOK SOME OF THESE LITTLE PIECES OF COPPER SLIPPED IT INTO THE LITTLE BENT PIECE OF THE PEN POINT AND MADE A LITTLE FOOT THAT I COULD ALSO USE WITH THE WAX
GoV9Ng9VBIM_12 0 JUST ANOTHER WAY TO MULTIPLY YOUR TOOLS

GiY2ljNGj4Y_1 0 WE'VE GOT A REALLY STICKY SUBJECT TODAY
GiY2ljNGj4Y_2 0 HI I'M JOE CUENCO WITH FAMILY RESOURCES AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH A CLINGY BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND
GiY2ljNGj4Y_3 0 WELL JUST HOW DO YOU COPE WITH A CLINGY GIRLFRIEND OR BOYFRIEND
GiY2ljNGj4Y_4 0 WELL COMMUNICATION IS REALLY THE FIRST KEY
GiY2ljNGj4Y_5 0 YOU'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT WHY IS THIS BEHAVIOR HAPPENING
GiY2ljNGj4Y_6 0 HAVE YOU DEFINED YOUR ROLES
GiY2ljNGj4Y_7 0 THE INTERACTION TIME THAT YOU WANT TO SPEND TOGETHER OR JUST THE QUALITY OF THE TIME YOU WANT TO SPEND TOGETHER BECAUSE THAT REALLY MAY BE SOME KEY AREAS OF FRICTION OR A REAL IMBALANCE OR MISUNDERSTANDING
GiY2ljNGj4Y_8 0 PERHAPS IT'S YOU
GiY2ljNGj4Y_9 0 ARE YOU GIVING HER THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF ATTENTION
GiY2ljNGj4Y_10 0 OR IS HE GIVING HER THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF ATTENTION
GiY2ljNGj4Y_11 0 IS SHE OR HE FEELING INADEQUATE
GiY2ljNGj4Y_12 0 OR NOT BEING INVOLVED IN YOUR LIFE SO THERE'S REALLY A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EMOTIONAL NEEDINESS VERSUS AFFECTION AND SO SOME PEOPLE BECOME CLINGY BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T GET ENOUGH TOUCH AND THAT'S REAL IMPORTANT
GiY2ljNGj4Y_13 0 AFFECTION IS A REAL KEY BUT IT DOESN'T FILL SOME OF THESE FUNDAMENTAL VOIDS THAT A PERSON MAY BE HAVING IN THEIR BACKGROUND SO YOU REALLY NEED TO SET THE PARAMETERS FOR YOUR RELATIONSHIP
GiY2ljNGj4Y_14 0 HOW MUCH TIME IS GOOD
GiY2ljNGj4Y_15 0 YOU REALLY NEED TO HAVE A DIALOG ON HOW YOU WANT THE RELATIONSHIP TO PROGRESS AND HOW MUCH TIME IS APPROPRIATE TO BE SPENDING WITH ONE ANOTHER AND THE TIME THAT YOU NEED APART BECAUSE EVERYBODY NEEDS TIME APART
GiY2ljNGj4Y_16 0 YOU NEED TIME TOGETHER BECAUSE IF YOU SPEND TOO MUCH TIME TOGETHER THEN YOU MIGHT BE OUT OF BALANCE
GiY2ljNGj4Y_17 0 IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU COME TOGETHER ON THE SPACE THAT YOU NEED THE SPACE THAT YOU NEED TOGETHER AND THEN MAXIMIZE THAT TIME TOGETHER SO IF YOU COME TO AGREEMENT ON COMMUNICATION
GiY2ljNGj4Y_18 0 DEFINE YOUR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND COME TO AGREEMENT AND KEEP THAT
GiY2ljNGj4Y_19 0 YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO HAVE THE ISSUES OF CLINGINESS OR STICKINESS FROM YOUR BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND AND BE MUCH HAPPIER AT THE END OF THE DAY
GiY2ljNGj4Y_20 0 I'M JOE CUENCO FAMILY RESOURCES RELATIONSHIPS FOR LIFE

h5Qwr8w5eQI_1 0 HI MY NAME IS LAUREN AND TODAY I AM HERE TO DISCUSS CAN YOU HIGHLIGHT HAIR DURING PREGNANCY
h5Qwr8w5eQI_2 0 CONSIDERING THAT HIGHLIGHTING IS NOT TOUCHING THE ROOT OF YOUR HAIR AND WILL NOT GO INTO YOUR BLOODSTREAM SO THE CHEMICALS CAN BE QUITE SAFE THAT WAY THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY GOING AND HITTING YOUR ROOT
h5Qwr8w5eQI_3 0 WHEN YOU GET YOUR HAIR HIGHLIGHTED YOU ARE GOING UP TO AND CLOSE TO THE ROOT HOWEVER YOU ARE NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO BE HITTING THE SKIN SO THEREFORE NONE OF IT WILL BE GOING IN WITHIN YOUR BLOOD STREAM SO HIGHLIGHTING CAN ULTIMATELY BE VERY SAFE FOR YOU WHILE YOU ARE PREGNANT
h5Qwr8w5eQI_4 0 I DO HOWEVER RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONSULT A DOCTOR AND MAKE SURE THAT IT GOES ALONG WITH YOUR PLAN
h5Qwr8w5eQI_5 0 ALSO THE FIRST THREE MONTHS IN THE FIRST TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY IS THE MOST CRUCIAL TIME OF PREGNANCY SO YOU CAN WAIT FOR THOSE THREE MONTHS AND NOT GET IT DONE SO THAT WAY YOU ARE NOT EVEN SURROUNDED BY THE CHEMICALS BY BEING WITHIN THE SUN YOU MAY BE BETTER OFF
h5Qwr8w5eQI_6 0 I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR AND THAT YOU DO HAVE HIS PERMISSION IN ORDER TO GET YOUR HAIR HIGHLIGHTED BUT AS FOR HIGHLIGHTING IT SHOULD BE PERFECTLY SAFE IN ORDER TO GET YOUR HAIR HIGHLIGHTED DURING PREGNANCY

gV7AHckkyhM_8 0 IT IS TIED IN SORT OF AN IMITATION OF HOW AMERICANS THOUGHT THAT MAYBE A TRIBAL WOMAN IN AFRICA WOULD WEAR IT
gV7AHckkyhM_9 0 THE TREND FOR ETHNIC STUFF WASN'T REALLY THAT GENUINE BUT IT WAS MORE OF THE IDEA THAT BEYOND AMERICA THERE WERE STYLES THAT WERE TRUER AND MORE REAL
gV7AHckkyhM_10 0 SOMETIMES PEOPLE WOULD COVER-UP ALL OF THEIR HAIR WITH A HAIR-WRAP LIKE THIS
gV7AHckkyhM_11 0 THE OTHER TWO BIG TRENDS FOR HAIRSTYLES IN THE 70'S WAS THE LONG STRAIGHT HAIR OF THE HIPPIES WORN COMPLETELY NATURAL WITH HIPPIE CLOTHING
gV7AHckkyhM_12 0 NO ADORNMENT NO PRODUCTS REALLY NOT ANYTHING IN IT
gV7AHckkyhM_13 0 OF COURSE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE NATURALLY STRAIGHT LONG HAIR WOULD IRON IT TO GET IT TO LOOK THAT WAY
gV7AHckkyhM_14 0 THE LAST REALLY POPULAR LOOK IN THE 70'S WHICH IS REALLY FUN IS THE FARRAH FAWCETT FLIP
gV7AHckkyhM_15 0 SHE WAS AN ACTRESS ON CHARLIE'S ANGELS
gV7AHckkyhM_16 0 THIS STYLE INVOLVED FLIPPING OUT THE FRONT OF YOUR HAIR
gV7AHckkyhM_17 0 IT WAS REALLY NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR NORMAL PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE BUT PEOPLE TRIED
gV7AHckkyhM_18 0 THEY WOULD SLEEP WITH SOUP CANS AROUND THEIR HEAD WITH THEIR HAIR TURNED OUT THAT WAY
gV7AHckkyhM_19 0 THEY MIGHT USE A CURLING IRON
gV7AHckkyhM_20 0 THEY MIGHT GO TO A HAIRSTYLIST AND SLEEP STANDING UP IN ORDER TO HAVE IT TO HAVE THIS PERFECT FLIPPED OUT HAIR
gV7AHckkyhM_21 0 FRANKLY NO ONE'S HAIR REALLY NATURALLY FALLS THAT WAY AND SO THE TREND HAS DIED OUT REALLY FAST

gol0NYiXzLc_1 0 HI MY NAME IS VERDIANA AND WE ARE WITH EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
gol0NYiXzLc_2 0 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO CLEAN YOUR WIG
gol0NYiXzLc_3 0 SO WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED CLEANING IT THOROUGHLY WITH WATER
gol0NYiXzLc_4 0 NOW THAT IT IS NICE AND CLEAN YOU WANT IT TO LET IT AIR DRY
gol0NYiXzLc_5 0 MAKE SURE YOU DON'T PUT IT BY YOUR HEATER OR ANYWHERE CLOSE TO YOUR ANIMALS OR YOUR PETS CAUSE IT WOULD BE WET AND DROOPY AND THEY MIGHT WANT TO PLAY WITH IT
gol0NYiXzLc_6 0 SO JUST LET IT AIR DRY COMPLETELY SO IT WOULD GO BACK TO ITS NATURAL STYLE
gol0NYiXzLc_7 0 YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T PLAY TOO MUCH WITH IT WHILE IT IS WET CAUSE IT IS VERY DELICATE WHEN IT IS WET
gol0NYiXzLc_8 0 IT IS PROBABLY THE MOST DELICATE THAT IT WOULD BE
gol0NYiXzLc_9 0 IT IS MORE SENSITIVE THE STRANDS TEND TO FALL OUT MORE IF YOU PULL ON IT TOO HARD
gol0NYiXzLc_10 0 SO JUST LET IT AIR DRY BEFORE YOU PLAY WITH IT OR DO ANYTHING WITH IT
gol0NYiXzLc_11 0 LIKE I SAID KEEP IT IN A SAFE PLACE AWAY FROM THE HEAT
gol0NYiXzLc_12 0 YOUR ANIMALS MAKE SURE THAT IT AIR DRIES COMPLETELY

-g-RbIaKjTo_1 0 SO TO GET TO THE BACK CORNER AND TO REITERATE EVERYTHING WE JUST TALKED ABOUT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT RIGHT FOOT LEFT FOOT RIGHT FOOT AND THAT PUTS YOU IN A GOOD POSITION OR IF YOU GO WITH THE THREE STEP YOU ARE GOING TO GO LEFT RIGHT LEFT
-g-RbIaKjTo_2 0 NOW ON THE FOREHAND SIDE YOU CAN GO LEFT BIG AND RIGHT AND YOU CAN COVER A HUGE AMOUNT OF COURT AND YOU USUALLY DO THAT WHEN YOU ARE UNDER SOME TYPE OF PRESSURE AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE IN THE STRONGEST POSITION SO YOU CAN SEE IF YOU ARE HERE YOU'RE IN KIND OF A RELATIVELY WEAK POSITION AND YOU CAN TURN IT AROUND AND IT WILL BE A GOOD SHOT BUT GETTING TO THE CORNER IN A MORE UPRIGHT POSITION IS BETTER
-g-RbIaKjTo_3 0 ALSO YOU CAN SIDE STEP AND WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS JUST FOCUS ON THIS AT HOME AND HAVE AN AREA OF YOUR HOUSE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO USE A COURT JUST DO THE FOUR STEP THREE STEP AND THE TWO STEP AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT YOU CAN START COVERING THIS AREA VERY EFFICIENTLY AND THAT IS THE KEY TO A GOOD GAME SO WORK YOUR STEPS BREAK THE GAME DOWN INTO THESE LITTLE BITE SIZE CHUNKS AND YOU WILL SEE YOUR MOVEMENT SKILLS REALLY IMPROVE
GSu1jmclxQ8_1 0 OUR NEXT CLIP IS GOING TO BE STABILIZATION CRUNCHES WITH THE MEDICINE BALL
GSu1jmclxQ8_2 0 OF COURSE YOU WANT TO GET DOWN NICE AND GENTLY ON THE MAT AND FOLD DOWN NICE AND SLOW AND YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE YOUR MEDICINE BALL AND YOU ARE GOING TO PLACE IT BETWEEN THE THIGHS AND YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP YOUR FEET AT NINETY DEGREES
GSu1jmclxQ8_3 0 NOW IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HOLDING ON TO THIS BALL YOU CAN ALWAYS TRY TO CROSS YOUR ANKLES BUT I RECOMMEND TRYING TO JUST POSITION YOUR FEET TO HOLD THE MEDICINE BALL
GSu1jmclxQ8_4 0 TAKE YOUR HANDS OVER HEAD AND WE ARE GOING TO REACH UP AND CRUNCH NICE AND SLOW
GSu1jmclxQ8_5 0 ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS EXERCISE IS YOU ARE ACTUALLY CAUSING YOUR INNER THIGHS TO CONTRACT AGAINST THE MEDICINE BALL WHICH IS GOING TO ADD AN EXTRA CHALLENGE AND YOU ARE GOING TO FEEL IT A LITTLE BIT DEEPER IN YOUR ABDOMINALS
GSu1jmclxQ8_6 0 I COULD DO THIS ALL DAY
GSu1jmclxQ8_7 0 YOU ARE ALSO HELPING TO STRENGTHEN YOUR LOWER BACK BY PRESSING IT DOWN FIRMLY ON TO THE MAT
GSu1jmclxQ8_8 0 NOW IF YOU WANTED TO ADD AN EXTRA CHALLENGE YOU COULD ACTUALLY REACH OVER TO THE SIDE COME DOWN TO THE CENTER YOU COULD CROSS AND COME BACK TO CENTER AND JUST STEP IT UP JUST A LITTLE BIT
hH6Ve6SuyWI_1 0 HI THIS IS DAVID JACKEL ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND I'M HEAR TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT CONVERTING MIDI FILES AND AUDIO FILES IN GARAGEBAND
hH6Ve6SuyWI_2 0 NOW THE REASON WHY YOU WANT TO TAKE A MIDI FILE AND CONVERT IT TO A AUDIO FILE IS THAT IT'S LESS OF A DRAIN TO YOUR COMPUTER
hH6Ve6SuyWI_3 0 BECAUSE MIDI FILES ARE COMPLETELY SOFTWARE INSTRUMENTS THERE MUCH MORE COMPLEX THEY EAT UP MEMORY AND THEY SLOW DOWN A SONG
hH6Ve6SuyWI_4 0 WHEN YOU SETTLE ON HOW YOU WANT THE MIDI FILE TO BE CONVERT IT TO AN AUDIO FILE TO MAKE IT LESS OF A DRAIN ON YOUR COMPUTER
hH6Ve6SuyWI_5 0 SO LET'S SAY I WANT TO ADD JUST ANOTHER LOOP BUT I DON'T WANT IT TO BE AS A MIDI FILE WHAT I DO IS I GO INTO GARAGEBAND SELECT PREFERENCES GO INTO LOOPS UP HERE AND WHERE IT SAYS ADDING LOOPS TO TIMELINE
hH6Ve6SuyWI_6 0 I SELECT CONVERT TO REAL INSTRUMENT NOW LET'S TRY IT OUT SO THERE'S THIS LOOP THAT I WANT TO USE PLAYING SO I CLICK IT I DRAG IT OVER HERE AND NOW AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S BLUE NOT GREEN
hH6Ve6SuyWI_7 0 GREEN MEANS MIDI BLUE MEANS REAL AUDIO AND THAT WAY AS I CONTINUE TO ADD LOOPS I CAN DO SO IN THE WAY THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO SLOW DOWN MY COMPUTER AND MAKE IT FREEZE
hH6Ve6SuyWI_8 0 SO ONCE YOU SETTLE ON HOW YOU WANT YOUR MIDI PART TO GO USE THIS TECHNIQUE TO MAKE THINGS EASIER ON YOUR COMPUTER
GNQFRoOBU6o_1 0 TO CALCULATE YOUR BODY MASS INDEX YOU WANT TO FIGURE OUT YOUR WEIGHT IN KILOGRAMS
GNQFRoOBU6o_2 0 YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT AND DIVIDE IT BY YOUR HEIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT YOUR HEIGHT IN METERS
GNQFRoOBU6o_3 0 THAT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU YOUR BMI
GNQFRoOBU6o_4 0 SO A VERY SAFE RANGE FOR BMI IS ANYTHING BETWEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT
GNQFRoOBU6o_5 0 ANYTHING BELOW NINETEEN IS CONSIDERED UNDERWEIGHT
GNQFRoOBU6o_6 0 ANYTHING ABOVE TWENTY-FIVE IS CONSIDERED OVER WEIGHT ALSO GOING INTO THE LATTER END OF OBESITY
GNQFRoOBU6o_7 0 IF USING THAT EQUATION IS WAY TOO COMPLICATED FOR YOU YOU CAN GO TO VARIOUS WEBSITES ON THE INTERNET YOU'RE GOING TO PRESS IN BMI THEY'RE GOING TO COME UP WITH A CALCULATOR AND THEY'RE GOING TO HELP YOU GET THROUGH IT
GNQFRoOBU6o_8 0 YOU'RE JUST GOING TO PUNCH IN YOUR HEIGHT AND YOUR WEIGHT AND THEY'LL FIGURE IT OUT FOR YOU AUTOMATICALLY
GNQFRoOBU6o_9 0 SO BASICALLY YOUR BODY MASS INDEX IS FIGURED UP FROM YOUR HEIGHT AND YOUR WEIGHT AND HOW MUCH OF THAT IS BODY FAT
Hi_JTPFkX9c_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE INITIAL RECOVERY AND AFTER CARE FOR MY BREAST AUGMENTATION SURGERY
Hi_JTPFkX9c_2 0 TYPICALLY A PATIENT WILL RETURN TO THE OFFICE WITHIN TWO OR THREE DAYS FOR AN INITIAL EXAMINATION TO ENSURE THAT ALL IS WELL THAT THE IMPLANTS ARE IN GOOD POSITION THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY EXCESSIVE BLEEDING OR SWELLING AND THAT THE PATIENT IS COMFORTABLE
Hi_JTPFkX9c_3 0 AT THAT TIME WE DISCUSS THE SPECIFICS OF EXACTLY WHAT WAS DECIDED AT SURGERY BECAUSE SOMETIMES THERE ARE SOME CHANGES AT THE LAST MINUTE IN TERMS OF THE SIZE
Hi_JTPFkX9c_4 0 BUT THERE REALLY SHOULD NOT BE ANY SURPRISES FOR THE PATIENT
Hi_JTPFkX9c_5 0 BUT AT THAT TIME YOU WE LET THE PATIENT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT SIZE THEY HAVE AND GIVE THEM AN INFORMATION CARD SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE THAT FOR THEIR RECORDS FOR THE FUTURE SO THAT IF THERE IS ANY PROBLEM THEY CAN ALWAYS REFER BACK TO WHAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR BREASTS
Hi_JTPFkX9c_6 0 AND THEN THE PATIENT IS INSTRUCTED TO START SHOWERING AND BEING AS ACTIVE AS POSSIBLE
Hi_JTPFkX9c_7 0 AND THEN GENERALLY WE START THE PATIENT ON A MASSAGE ROUTINE WHERE THE IMPLANTS ARE MOVED AND MOBILIZED A BIT TO HELP THEM TO ACCOMMODATE TO THE SPACE THAT'S BEEN CREATED BENEATH THE MUSCLE
Hi_JTPFkX9c_8 0 AT THAT POINT THE PATIENT IS GENERALLY OFF PAIN MEDICINE AND COMPLETING A SHORT COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS AND STARTING TO GET BACK TO THEIR NORMAL ROUTINE
Hi_JTPFkX9c_9 0 THEY HAVE A POST SURGICAL BRA WHICH IS A SOFT SPORTS TYPE BRA AND WE HAVE THE PATIENT WEAR THAT PRETTY MUCH FULL TIME FOR THE FIRST WEEK OR SO AND THEN GRADUALLY TO WEAN OFF OF THAT AND THEN INTO A NORMAL BRA SHORTLY THEREAFTER
h_7qhS_fSus_2 0 THIS IS DAVE FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE ARE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE ALBONDIGAS SOUP
h_7qhS_fSus_3 0 OKAY OUR NEXT INGREDIENT FOR OUR ALBONDIGAS SOUP IS CARROTS
h_7qhS_fSus_4 0 I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO CUT THIS UP
h_7qhS_fSus_5 0 OKAY NOW I AM GOING TO GO AHEAD AND LEAVE THE SKIN ON THIS CARROT
h_7qhS_fSus_6 0 IT HAS A LOT OF NUTRIENTS AND I THINK A LOT OF FLAVOR TO IT
h_7qhS_fSus_7 0 IF YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND PEEL THAT YOU CAN
h_7qhS_fSus_8 0 BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TAKE OFF THE ROOT END HERE
h_7qhS_fSus_9 0 KIND OF JUST SET THAT TO THE SIDE
h_7qhS_fSus_10 0 NOW YOU CAN CUT THESE INTO COINS
h_7qhS_fSus_11 0 THIS IS A PRETTY THICK CARROT HERE SO AS I SAID BEFORE I WANT TO KEEP THIS SORT OF UNIFORMED
h_7qhS_fSus_12 0 SO I LIKE TO SPLIT THESE IN HALF AND AGAIN WE ARE JUST USING ONE NOW BUT YOU COULD USE MORE IF THAT IS WHAT YOU REALLY LIKE IN SOUP
h_7qhS_fSus_13 0 SO NOW YOU'VE GOT A FLAT SURFACE ONCE AGAIN AND THEN I MAKE THESE INTO HALF COINS AND YOU CAN MAKE THEM AS THICK AS YOU LIKE
h_7qhS_fSus_14 0 AGAIN I JUST MAKE THESE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS ANYTHING ELSE
h_7qhS_fSus_15 0 YOU SEE YOU ARE GOING TO GET LITTLE COINS LIKE THAT LITTLE HALF COINS
h_7qhS_fSus_16 0 THESE ARE GOING TO ADD SOME GREAT FLAVOR TO YOUR SOUP
GV-8NsvgUuE_1 0 ARE YOU A MASSAGE THERAPIST AND YOU ARE CURIOUS ABOUT HOW YOU ARE GOING TO CHOOSE YOUR MASSAGE TABLE
GV-8NsvgUuE_2 0 WHAT ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU THINK ABOUT
GV-8NsvgUuE_3 0 WELL I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THREE GOOD TIPS TODAY
GV-8NsvgUuE_4 0 I'M SUNDAE WITH NATURAL SUNDAE
GV-8NsvgUuE_5 0 NOW LIKE I JUST SAID THERE ARE SO MANY CHOICES AND SO MANY OPTIONS THESE DAYS FOR BUYING YOUR MASSAGE TABLE BUT THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT ONES ARE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR TABLE IS THE RIGHT SIZE AND TWENTY EIGHT INCHES IN WIDTH TO THIRTY TWO INCHES ARE THE RECOMMENDED WIDTH FOR A MASSAGE TABLE
GV-8NsvgUuE_6 0 IF IT'S TOO NARROW YOUR CLIENT IS GOING TO FALL OFF AND THAT'S NOT GOOD
GV-8NsvgUuE_7 0 AND IF IT'S TOO WIDE YOUR THERAPIST IS GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME WORKING AROUND IT AND END UP PROBABLY INJURING HER BACK SO TWENTY EIGHT TO THIRTY TWO INCHES IS USUALLY THE RECOMMENDED WIDTH FOR A MASSAGE TABLE
GV-8NsvgUuE_8 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT BOLSTER WHICH IS THE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT SUPPORTS YOUR LOWER BACK
GV-8NsvgUuE_9 0 NOW BOLSTERS COME IN MANY SHAPES AND MANY SIZES AND MANY KINDS OF PADDING
GV-8NsvgUuE_10 0 YOU WANT TO REALLY TEST YOUR BOLSTER OUT MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T JUST COME WITH THE A LITTLE BOLSTER THAT IS JUST FREE WITH THE TABLE
GV-8NsvgUuE_11 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S A QUALITY BOLSTER AND NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT THE MANUFACTURER ARE JUST THROWING IN WITH YOUR TABLE
GV-8NsvgUuE_12 0 MAKE SURE IT'S NICE MAKE SURE YOU LIKE YOUR BOLSTER BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO GET A LOT OF USE OUT OF IT AND IT'S IMPORTANT
GV-8NsvgUuE_13 0 AND THE THIRD PIECE OF EQUIPMENT TO REMEMBER ON YOUR TABLE IS YOUR LOCKING MECHANISM ON YOUR FACE CRADLE
GV-8NsvgUuE_14 0 FIRST THING YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR CRADLE IS GOING TO SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF YOUR HEAD
GV-8NsvgUuE_15 0 YOU WANT A REALLY STABLE LOCKING MECHANISM
GV-8NsvgUuE_16 0 YOU ALSO WANT IT TO BE VERY PADDED
GV-8NsvgUuE_17 0 SO GET FAMILIAR WITH THESE THINGS BEFORE YOU PUT YOUR MONEY ON THE TABLE AND BUY IT CAUSE USUALLY YOU CAN'T TAKE THEM BACK
GV-8NsvgUuE_18 0 SO LOCKING MECHANISM VERY VERY IMPORTANT
GV-8NsvgUuE_19 0 IF YOUR LOCKING MECHANISM GOES OUT THAT'S BAD NEWS
GV-8NsvgUuE_20 0 YOU CAN HURT YOUR CLIENT'S NECK AND THAT'S NEVER GOOD
GV-8NsvgUuE_21 0 SOMETHING CAN RESULT FROM THAT THAT YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK ABOUT SO GOOD STURDY NECK REST
GV-8NsvgUuE_22 0 AND THEN ALSO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT I DIDN'T EVEN WASN'T REALLY AWARE ABOUT UNTIL I BOUGHT MY TABLE THE OWNER OF THE SHOP SUGGESTED THAT I GET A CARRYING CASE WHICH I NEVER EVEN HEARD OF BEFORE
GV-8NsvgUuE_23 0 I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY CAME WITH THEM
GV-8NsvgUuE_24 0 BUT A CARRYING CASE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS BECAUSE THAT CASE IS GOING TO KEEP YOUR ABILITY TO MAKE A LIVING
GV-8NsvgUuE_25 0 IT'S GOING TO INCREASE IT FOR YOU
GV-8NsvgUuE_26 0 IT'S GOING TO KEEP YOUR TABLE NICE AND PROTECTED AND CLEAN
GV-8NsvgUuE_27 0 IF YOUR TABLE IS NOT PROTECTED AND CLEAN NOBODY IS GOING TO WANT TO GET ON IT AND IT'S GOING TO GET TORN UP AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER ONE
GV-8NsvgUuE_28 0 AND THEY ARE PRETTY EXPENSIVE SO IT'S A GREAT WAY TO KEEP YOUR TABLE PROTECTED AND KEEP YOUR MEANS OF MAKING A LIVING PROTECTED
GV-8NsvgUuE_29 0 SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW THINGS TO THINK ABOUT WHEN BUYING YOUR MASSAGE TABLE
GV-8NsvgUuE_30 0 THE WIDTH IS IMPORTANT THE BOLSTER IS VERY IMPORTANT THE LOCKING MECHANISM ON YOUR NECK SUPPORT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND YOU DEFINITELY NEED A CASE
GV-8NsvgUuE_31 0 IT WILL BE SO MUCH EASIER TO CARRY IT AROUND AS WELL
GV-8NsvgUuE_32 0 SO THAT'S WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO ME I HOPE IT HELPED YOU OUT TODAY
GV-8NsvgUuE_33 0 I'M SUNDAE WITH NATURAL SUNDAE
GW8JDE6u7FI_1 0 I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IMPROV IS NOT
GW8JDE6u7FI_2 0 I ALREADY MENTIONED THAT WHAT IMPROV IS IS STUFF MADE UP ONE THE SPOT OFTEN INSPIRED BY AUDIENCE SUGGESTION
GW8JDE6u7FI_3 0 PEOPLE GET A LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT IMPROV IS
GW8JDE6u7FI_4 0 LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IMPROV IS NOT
GW8JDE6u7FI_5 0 IMPROV IS NOT STAND-UP COMEDY
GW8JDE6u7FI_6 0 IT'S NOT SOMEONE IN FRONT OF A MICROPHONE TELLING JOKES THAT'S STAND-UP COMEDY
GW8JDE6u7FI_7 0 IMPROV IS NOT SKETCH COMEDY
GW8JDE6u7FI_8 0 THAT'S WHEN SOMEONE WROTE AN IDEA FOR A SCENE THEY MEMORIZED THE LINES AND THEY ACT IT OUT ON STAGE
GW8JDE6u7FI_9 0 EVEN THOUGH SOME MOMENTS MIGHT BE A LITTLE IMPROMPTU THAT'S SKETCH COMEDY LIKE WHAT YOU MIGHT SEE ON SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE
GW8JDE6u7FI_10 0 IMPROV COMEDY IS WHEN THERE'S NO SCRIPT AT ALL
GW8JDE6u7FI_11 0 IT'S COMPLETELY MADE UP ON THE SPOT OFTEN INSPIRED BY AUDIENCE SUGGESTIONS
GW8JDE6u7FI_12 0 IMPROV COMEDY IS NOT IMPROV JAZZ ALTHOUGH THAT IS IMPROV THAT'S NOT WHAT IMPROV COMEDY IS
GW8JDE6u7FI_13 0 SO TO CLARIFY IMPROV IS NOT STAND-UP IMPROV IS NOT SKETCH COMEDY IMPROV IS NOT JAZZ MUSIC
GW8JDE6u7FI_14 0 IMPROV COMEDY IS IMPROV COMEDY
Gje0P7J9pSw_1 0 HI I'M ALLISON AND I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO CAST ON
Gje0P7J9pSw_2 0 THERE ARE MANY TECHNIQUES BUT TODAY I'LL SHOW YOU THE BASIC VERSATILE TECHNIQUE OF THE LONG TAIL CAST ON
Gje0P7J9pSw_3 0 FOR THE LONG TAIL CAST ON TAKE YOUR YARN AND GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF LENGTH TO THE SHORT END PLACE THAT OVER YOUR THUMB AND THEN THE OTHER END ATTACH TO THE BALL OVER YOUR POINTER FINGER
Gje0P7J9pSw_4 0 CURL THE LOWER FINGERS AROUND THE YARN TO HOLD IT IN YOUR PALM
Gje0P7J9pSw_5 0 PLACE THE NEEDLE THROUGH THE TRIANGLE AND THEN FOLLOW UP THE THUMB THROUGH THE LOOP DOWN THE POINTER FINGER AND DOWN THROUGH THE LOOP ON THE THUMB
Gje0P7J9pSw_6 0 USE THE THUMB TO TIGHTEN UP WITHOUT LETTING GO OF YOUR YARN AND YOU'VE CAST ON YOUR FIRST TWO STITCHES
Gje0P7J9pSw_7 0 FROM NOW ON EACH TIME THAT YOU REPEAT THIS PROCEDURE YOU WILL ADD ONE STITCH
Gje0P7J9pSw_8 0 SO UP THROUGH THUMB DOWN THE POINTER FINGER THROUGH THE LOOP ON THE THUMB
Gje0P7J9pSw_9 0 LET GO OF THE THUMB TIGHTEN THE YARN THROUGH THE NEEDLE AND YOU'VE NOW CAST ON YOUR THIRD STITCH
HI2jdTWU4yM_1 0 NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THE GRADIENT TOOL
HI2jdTWU4yM_2 0 IF WE LOOK AT OUR SCREEN HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT I HAVE THIS SUNFLOWER THAT I HAVE ROUGHLY CUT OUT OF ITS BACKGROUND
HI2jdTWU4yM_3 0 AND I WANT TO ADD A GRADIENT BACKGROUND SO I'VE CHOSEN A COUPLE OF BLUE COLORS HERE BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE MY GRADIENT'S GOING TO PULL FROM
HI2jdTWU4yM_4 0 AND I COME UP HERE AND I TOUCH ON THIS AND THIS IS MY GRADIENT TOOL WITH THE SHORTCUT G WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO PULL A LINE HERE
HI2jdTWU4yM_5 0 AND AS YOU CAN SEE I'VE GOT MY SET TO SET TO DO A GRADIENT LINE
HI2jdTWU4yM_6 0 WELL LET'S DO A FULL GRADIENT BACKGROUND COLOR SO I'LL GRAB THAT ONE
HI2jdTWU4yM_7 0 LET'S GO FROM LOW TO HIGH HERE LIKE SO
HI2jdTWU4yM_8 0 AND AS YOU CAN SEE THE GRADIENT WENT FROM THE LIGHT COLOR TO THE DARK COLOR
HI2jdTWU4yM_9 0 AND IF WE ACTUALLY DO IT TO THE SIDE LIKE THIS YOU'LL SEE IT WILL ACTUALLY CONFORM TO HOWEVER WE PULL IT
HI2jdTWU4yM_10 0 THE STARTING POINT'S GOING TO BE THE FOREGROUND COLOR OR THE BACKGROUND COLOR NOT THE FOREGROUND COLOR AND THE ENDING POINT'S GOING TO BE THE BACKGROUND COLOR
HI2jdTWU4yM_11 0 SO YOU CAN JUST SIT HERE AND PULL IT AROUND HOWEVER YOU WANT TO AND JUST CHOOSE WHICHEVER COLORS YOU WANT WHERE AND YOU KNOW PLAY AROUND WITH IT AND HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH IT

Gf_Ir4Sp994_3 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO DO A TAIL TAP ON A SKATEBOARD
Gf_Ir4Sp994_4 0 BEFORE YOU CAN DO A TAIL TAP THERE'S A COUPLE OF TRICKS THAT YOU MUST KNOW
Gf_Ir4Sp994_5 0 DROPPING IN BEING THE FIRST WHICH ACTUALLY EMULATES A TAIL TAP WHEN YOU DROP IN AND BEING ABLE TO RIDE BACKWARDS ON YOUR SKATEBOARD AT A CONSTANT SPEED TO GET BACK UP TO THE COPING WHERE YOU ORIGINALLY DROPPED IN FROM
Gf_Ir4Sp994_6 0 TO DO A TAIL TAP IT'S MUCH LIKE A DROP IN
Gf_Ir4Sp994_7 0 YOU WANT TO COME UP BACKWARDS RIGHT BEFORE YOU GET TO THE BAR YOU WANT TO PUT ALL OF YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR BACK FOOT SLAMMING THE TAIL INTO THE PLATFORM YOUR WHEELS AND TRUCKS INTO THE COPING GIVING YOU THIS LOCKED IN POSITION AND IT SHOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WHEN YOU DO IT PROPERLY
Gf_Ir4Sp994_8 0 YOU'LL KNOW YOU'VE DONE ONE RIGHT WHEN YOU HEAR A NICE CRISP SOUND WHEN YOU LOCK YOUR TAIL OF YOUR BOARD AND YOUR WHEELS AND TRUCKS IN
Gf_Ir4Sp994_9 0 SO NOW I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE A TAIL TAP
Gf_Ir4Sp994_10 0 THAT'S HOW YOU DO A TAIL TAP ON A SKATEBOARD

Gk6i4jMLGEA_2 0 LET'S CONTINUE NOW WITH OUR SESSIONS ON HOW TO USE A TWO TRACK REEL TO REEL TAPE RECORDER
Gk6i4jMLGEA_3 0 ON THIS SESSION WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WE'VE GOT A SONG ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE REEL TO REEL ON THIS TWO TRACK REEL TO REEL AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FLIP THINGS OVER SO THAT WE CAN HEAR IT
Gk6i4jMLGEA_4 0 SO THE FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO I ALWAYS TURN THE DECK OFF BECAUSE IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME AND HEAT IS ONE OF THE MAJOR KILLERS OF ELECTRONICS SO I TEND TO TURN THE DECK OFF
Gk6i4jMLGEA_5 0 NEXT THING I DO IS I LOOSEN UP THE TAPE
Gk6i4jMLGEA_6 0 AS YOU NOTICE IT'S GETTING LOOSE
Gk6i4jMLGEA_7 0 DON'T TOUCH THE TAPE
Gk6i4jMLGEA_8 0 DON'T TOUCH IT DON'T PUT YOUR FINGERPRINTS ON THERE THAT WILL RUIN THE TAPE
Gk6i4jMLGEA_9 0 NEXT THING I DO IS I LOOSEN THE REELS SO THAT I CAN GET THE REELS OFF
Gk6i4jMLGEA_10 0 AND THAT'S THE NEXT THING I DO I THEN REMOVE THE REELS CAREFULLY SO AS TO NOT TOUCH THE TAPE

Gk6i4jMLGEA_12 0 LINE THEM UP THERE WITH THE HUB THERE YOU GO THAT ONE'S IN
Gk6i4jMLGEA_13 0 THIS ONE'S NOW IN OVER HERE AND THEN DO THE REVERSE BY JUST POPPING THEM IN MAKING SURE THEY LOCK IN PLACE AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT THE TAPES ARE NOW IN A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN LOCK THEM BACK DOWN
Gk6i4jMLGEA_14 0 SO I LOCK THEM BACK DOWN I DON'T FORGET TO DO THAT WHICH IS THE NEXT STEP

g69NkOcU8GE_1 0 HI MY NAME IS MICHAEL QUEBEC AND TODAY'S SUBJECT IS HOW TO STRETCH AFTER A RUN
g69NkOcU8GE_2 0 AFTER A RUN YOU ARE PRETTY WARM AND SO THE RISK OF INJURY FOR STRETCHING ISN'T QUITE AS MUCH BUT IT'S ALWAYS STILL A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE IT SLOW AND EASY
g69NkOcU8GE_3 0 WORKING THE WAY FROM THE BOTTOMS UP IN WHICH CASE I'LL START WITH THE CALVES
g69NkOcU8GE_4 0 I'LL HAVE MY BACK STRAIGHT I'LL HAVE THE BACK HEEL FLAT
g69NkOcU8GE_5 0 I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND LUNGE FORWARD WITH MY CHEST STRETCHING OUT THAT CALF
g69NkOcU8GE_6 0 SWITCHING THAT TO THE OTHER SIDE IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO HOLD THESE STRETCHES FIFTEEN SECONDS OR MORE
g69NkOcU8GE_7 0 NOW I'M GOING TO STRETCH MY HAMSTRINGS AND MY GLUTES ALL AT ONCE
g69NkOcU8GE_8 0 FEET WIDE TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN LIFTING UP BREATHING OUT REACHING FORWARD
g69NkOcU8GE_9 0 YOU'LL NOTICE I'M HOLDING IT I'M NOT BOUNCING
g69NkOcU8GE_10 0 FROM THERE LIFTING UP GRAB THAT ANKLE ONE SIDE HOLD THAT FOR FIFTEEN SECONDS
g69NkOcU8GE_11 0 TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN LIFTING UP
g69NkOcU8GE_12 0 THAT ANKLE FIFTEEN SECONDS
g69NkOcU8GE_13 0 SO I'VE STRETCHED OUT MY LEGS THOUGH YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IT BUT YOU ARE WORKING YOUR OTHER BODY PARTS SOMETIMES WHILE YOU ARE RUNNING
g69NkOcU8GE_14 0 IF YOU'VE PUMPED YOUR ARMS YOU MIGHT GET A LITTLE STIFF IN YOUR UPPER BODY AS WELL
g69NkOcU8GE_15 0 PLUS RUNNING IS A HIGH IMPACT ENDEAVOR SO IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO STRETCH YOUR UPPER BODY
g69NkOcU8GE_16 0 I'M JUST GOING TO REACH UP CLASPING THE HANDS TILTING TO ONE SIDE STRETCHING OUT MY LATS THE OTHER SIDE
g69NkOcU8GE_17 0 ROUNDING OUT THE UPPER BACK KEEPING THE LOWER BACK STRAIGHT COLLAPSING THE CHEST IN HEAD INTO MY ARMS AND I ALSO STRETCH OUT MY UPPER BODY AS WELL
g69NkOcU8GE_18 0 HOWEVER THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS TO STRETCH WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING ARE OF COURSE YOUR LOWER BODY YOUR LEGS
g69NkOcU8GE_19 0 SO ONCE AGAIN TO REITERATE CALVES HAMSTRINGS AND GLUTES
g69NkOcU8GE_20 0 HOLDING THEM STEADY FIFTEEN SECONDS EACH SIDE
g69NkOcU8GE_21 0 AND THAT IS HOW TO STRETCH AFTER A RUN
_hBhpZc21Wo_1 0 SO FOR YOUR NEXT DOUBLE STOP WE'RE LOOKING AT THE F AND C SO FOR SECOND POSITION YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE STARTING IN SECOND ON YOUR D STRING ON YOUR F SO YOU CAN SLIDE UP TO F AND THE C IS RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE F SO THIS IS GIVING YOU A CHANCE TO LEARN TO PLAY DOUBLE STOP WHERE YOUR FIRST FINGER IS GOING PRACTICE HOLDING DOWN TWO STRINGS AT ONCE ON THE FINGER PAD
_hBhpZc21Wo_2 0 AND YOU'LL FIND THAT YOU REALLY DON'T NEED TO DO ANYTHING EXTRA WITH YOUR FIRST FINGER REALLY ALL YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE ALLOWING MORE ROOM ON YOUR FINGER PAD FOR THE SECOND STRING
_hBhpZc21Wo_3 0 SO AS OPPOSED TO JUST PLAYING THE ONE ALONE BY ITSELF WHERE THE STRING IS AND RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF THE FINGER PAD NOW YOU'RE ALLOWING BOTH STRINGS TO BE PLAYED ALL AT ONCE
gRBVu1n0xHA_1 0 COMPUHOST COMPUTERIZED KARAOKE HOSTING SOLUTION IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF ENVISIONS SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS AND I AM IN NO WAY AFFILIATED WITH ENVISIONS SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS
gRBVu1n0xHA_2 0 OK IN THIS NEXT CLIP I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE KARAOKE PLAYER PORTION OF THE COMPUHOST SYSTEM

gRBVu1n0xHA_6 0 THE SONG WILL START YOU DON'T YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE TROUBLE OF FINDING THE SONG
gRBVu1n0xHA_7 0 ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ACTUALLY JUST PUSH STOP AND YOU COULD RESTART THE SONG AGAIN
gRBVu1n0xHA_8 0 GREAT LITTLE FEATURE
gRBVu1n0xHA_9 0 ALSO YOU HAVE THE KARAOKE PLAYER HERE
gRBVu1n0xHA_10 0 IF YOU HAVE A GREAT VIDEO CARD YOU WILL ACTUALLY SEE THE WORDS COMING UP IN THIS MONITOR THIS LITTLE MONITOR WHICH IS GREAT IF YOU'RE IN A DJ BOOTH OR YOU'RE IN A YOU KNOW PART OF THE VENUE WHERE YOU CAN'T SEE THE OUTGOING WORDS
gRBVu1n0xHA_11 0 AND ALSO LETS YOU KNOW THE WORDS OF THE SONGS SO IF YOU HAVE TO HELP SOMEONE SING WHO'S A YOU KNOW A BEGINNER
gRBVu1n0xHA_12 0 IT'S JUST A NICE FEATURE TO HAVE
gRBVu1n0xHA_13 0 OVER HERE YOU HAVE YOUR VOLUME CONTROL WHICH YOU CAN GO HIGHER AND LOWER
gRBVu1n0xHA_14 0 AND NEXT TO IT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE YOUR LCD LIGHT READOUT TO LET YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE REDLINING AND YOU'RE GOING TOO STRONG YOU WANT TO BRING IT DOWN
gRBVu1n0xHA_15 0 YOU ALWAYS WANT TO STAY WITHIN THE GREEN TO YELLOW AREA
gRBVu1n0xHA_16 0 IF YOU'RE REDLINING IT AND THERE'S A RED LIGHT COMING ON YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG AND YOU SHOULD LOW DOWN YOU KNOW LOW YOUR GAINS OR YOU KNOW DEFINITELY LOWER YOUR VOLUME
gRBVu1n0xHA_17 0 YOU HAVE YOUR KEY CHANGES AND YOUR TEMPO CHANGES WHICH IS A GREAT FEATURE IF THE SINGER KNOWS THAT THEY WANT TO SING A SONG A LOWER KEY YOU COULD DO IT
gRBVu1n0xHA_18 0 EACH TIME YOU CLICK ON THE KEY CHAIN UH KEY CHANGE IT'S DONE IN HALF STEPS SO TWO HALF STEPS WOULD BE ONE FULL OCTAVE YOU WOULD BE BRINGING IT UP OR DOWN
gRBVu1n0xHA_19 0 WHAT'S ALSO GREAT IS THIS KEY CHANGE AND THIS TEMPO CHANGE WILL ALWAYS BE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER WHAT YOUR SONG OR WHAT SONG YOUR SINGER HAS SUNG
gRBVu1n0xHA_20 0 AND SO WHEN THEY COME BACK AND THEY SAY CAN I SING THAT SONG
gRBVu1n0xHA_21 0 AND THEY SAY CAN YOU LOWER THE KEY
gRBVu1n0xHA_22 0 IT ALREADY REMEMBERS IT
gRBVu1n0xHA_23 0 AND PEOPLE LOVE THAT
gRBVu1n0xHA_24 0 IT'S A GREAT WAY TO ACTUALLY BREAK THE ICE WITH SOME OF YOUR NEW SINGERS WHEN THEY COME BACK
gRBVu1n0xHA_25 0 AND IT'S A WAY FOR YOU TO REMEMBER THEM AND REMEMBER THAT THEY'RE YOU KNOW IF YOU SEE THAT THE KEYS DOWN YOU COULD SAY HEY I GOT THAT ALREADY

hjEG_awXpPk_1 0 AN IMPORTANT GENERAL POINT FOR ANY BACK AND REAR LEG PROBLEMS IS BLADDER 23
hjEG_awXpPk_2 0 IT'S FOUND ALONG THE SPINE
hjEG_awXpPk_3 0 WHAT YOU DO IS SEARCH FOR YOUR LAST RIB AND WHERE YOU CAN FEEL THAT LAST RIB
hjEG_awXpPk_5 0 FIND THE SPINE AND YOU'LL FEEL POINTS STICKING UP AND THEN HOLLOWS
hjEG_awXpPk_6 0 COUNT TO THE SECOND HOLLOW AND COCO IS GOING TO LIE DOWN FOR THIS ONE BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF HER FAVORITES
hjEG_awXpPk_7 0 NOW YOU DON'T WANT TO GO INTO THE HOLLOW
hjEG_awXpPk_8 0 YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO GO ON EITHER SIDE OF IT AND AS YOU RUN YOUR FINGERS UP AND DOWN ON EITHER SIDE YOU'LL FEEL THEM SORT OF SINK INTO THIS VALLEY
hjEG_awXpPk_9 0 STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN PRESSURE ON BOTH SIDES
hjEG_awXpPk_10 0 YOU CAN USE ONE HAND WITH TWO FINGERS LIKE I'M DOING OR YOU CAN USE ONE FINGER FROM EACH HAND TO DO THE SAME
hjEG_awXpPk_11 0 YOU PUT THAT PRESSURE THERE JUST A STEADY PRESSURE OR YOU CAN DO A ROCKING MOTION JUST BACK AND FORTH AND BACK AND FORTH AND THAT'S ONE THAT SHE OBJECTS TO AND THIS WILL HAPPEN SOMETIMES WITH YOUR ANIMAL THAT THEY WILL OBJECT TO A POINT
hjEG_awXpPk_12 0 THAT'S TELLING YOU THAT IT'S A LITTLE TOO UNCOMFORTABLE SO WHAT YOU THEN WANT TO DO IS MOVE TO ANOTHER POINT AND GO ON FROM THERE
gA4aIveuy8M_1 0 OKAY WE'RE DOING A DECK ASSESSMENT EVALUATION
gA4aIveuy8M_2 0 THIS DECK IS PROBABLY TWENTY-YEARS OLD A LOT OF THE BOARDS ARE REALLY QUITE WELL UP AGAINST THE HOUSE BUT AS YOU GET OUT FARTHER WAY FROM THE HOUSE YOU GET MORE WEATHER MORE SUN AND IT JUST DESTROYS THE BOARDS
gA4aIveuy8M_3 0 WE HAVE SOME TWELVE FOOTERS HERE THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUT THE NAILS THANK GOD IT JUST HAS NAILS WE CAN POP OUT THE NAILS AND REPLACE SOME OF THE TWELVE FOOTERS HERE THAT ARE REALLY BAD
gA4aIveuy8M_4 0 WHEN YOU COME UP TO THE JOINTS A LOT OF TIME THE JOINTS FOR THE BOARDS ARE SPONGY AND BAD ON THE ENDS OF THEM
gA4aIveuy8M_5 0 SO WHAT I DO IS I'LL TAKE THEM AND CHOP OUT FROM ONE SECTION TO ANOTHER JOINT AND JUST REPLACE THAT WHERE THE JOINT OF THE BOARDS MEET AND IN THE END WHERE THEY GET SPONGY AND ROT OUT
gA4aIveuy8M_6 0 THE PERSON HERE DOES NOT LIKE THESE BIG UGLY KNOTS AND WE WERE GOING TO CHOP THEM OFF HERE BUT ON SECOND THOUGHT WE CAN CHOP THE SIX BY SIX OFF HERE AND WE RE GOING TO RUN THE RAILING STRAIGHT ACROSS THE TOPS OF THESE AND WERE GOING TO REPLACE ALL THE RAILING BECAUSE ALL THE RAILING IS JUST ALL SHOT
gA4aIveuy8M_7 0 ONCE WE GET THESE CHOPPED OFF WE CAN RUN OUR TOPS TWO BY SIX RAIL ALL THE WAY ALONG MAKE IT ALL NICE AND STRAIGHT NICE AND EVEN
gA4aIveuy8M_8 0 OKAY THIS IS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DECK AND AGAIN WE HAVE SPONGY ROTTED TWO BY SIX REDWOODS HERE AND A LOT OF TIMES YOU CAN JUST CUT OUT A FOUR FOOT SECTION AND REPLACE WHERE IT'S BAD AND OF COURSE SCREW THAT DOWN
gA4aIveuy8M_9 0 THEY'VE REPLACED A COUPLE BOARDS IN HERE WHICH JUST LOOK REALLY TERRIBLE THOSE HAVE TO COME UP AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO REPLACE ANYTHING THAT IS BAD IN THE DECK SO THAT WE BRING IT BACK UP TO WHAT IT SHOULD BE

gA4aIveuy8M_12 0 SO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS TO RUN AN I-BOLT OVER HERE INTO THE HOUSE AND THE SOLE PLATE COME ALONG AND JUST PULL THIS POST HERE OVER LEVEL SO THAT OUR RAILING HAS A STRAIGHT SHOT AND LOOKS WELL HERE
gA4aIveuy8M_13 0 THIS DECK IS TWENTY YEARS OLD IT HAS HAD A SOLID STAIN ON IT MANY TIMES WE'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE COLOR WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THIS BLACK WE'RE GOING TO REPLACE THE BOARDS THAT NEED TO BE REPLACED WHEN WE DO THAT WE'LL HAVE NEW WOOD
gA4aIveuy8M_14 0 I'M GOING TO TAKE AND RUN MY PRESSURE WASHER AND CLEAN IT UP ALL REAL GOOD AND GET OFF ALL THE DIRT AND LOSE DEBRIS AND THAN I'M GOING TO TAKE AND SPRAY AND PAT ON TWO COATS OF A SOLID STAIN
gA4aIveuy8M_15 0 I DO THAT BECAUSE WITH ANY BARE WOOD YOU CAN'T JUST PUT ON ONE COAT AND EXPECT IT TO HOLD UP
gA4aIveuy8M_16 0 YOU NEED TO PUT ON AT LEAST TWO COATS ON ANY BARE WOOD
GG_idnZ8v_k_1 0 OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO STRETCH AND CONTRACT A LITTLE BIT MORE MY STOMACH AND MY LEGS AND CONTINUING STRETCHING

GyHRezfBrWo_1 0 ALRIGHTY NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO V-NECKS AND THE V-NECK LOOKS LIKE THIS UPON COMPLETION WITH VARIATIONS AS YOU SO CHOOSE AND IN ORDER TO DRAW IT WE'RE GOING TO DO A BASIC V AND SINCE WE'RE STILL UP HERE AT THE SHOULDERS WE CAN ANGLE IT BACK A LITTLE TO GIVE SOME 3D GIVE SOME DIMENSION AND THEN IT CAN BE THIS IS JUST A MINIMAL MODEST V-NECK LIKE YOU'D HAVE IN A SWEATER SAY
GyHRezfBrWo_2 0 OR MY FAVORITE THING I LIKE TO EXAGGERATE EVERYTHING SO I'M GOING TO GO LIKE THIS AND WHO'S TO SAY THERE'S A SHIRT UNDERNEATH OR THERE'S NOT
GyHRezfBrWo_3 0 WHO'S TO SAY IT'S A DRESS OR IT'S NOT
GyHRezfBrWo_4 0 IT COULD BE TIGHT
GyHRezfBrWo_5 0 IT COULD BE A SWEATER
GyHRezfBrWo_6 0 IT COULD BE POLYESTER
GyHRezfBrWo_7 0 IT COULD BE SWEATSHIRT MATERIAL AND THEN THIS IS WHERE THE FUN PART COMES IN BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT THAT AND YOU LOOK AT THAT YOU DRAW YOU'VE DRAWN THAT DEEP V AND YOU'RE LIKE OH MY GOD I WANT TO DRAW AN ARM
GyHRezfBrWo_8 0 OH MY GOD I KNOW WHAT THIS IS GOING TO BE AND THEN IT JUST FLOWS AND ERUPTS AND CREATES AND YOU GO FROM HAVING BLAH DE BLAH V-NECK TO SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE SO PROUD OF AND THAT'S SO AWESOME YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY WAIT TO MAKE AND WEAR
gybFB6ULTlo_1 0 SO NOW THAT WE HAVE THE NEW LENGTH MARKED WE HAVE OUR CUFFS MARKED WHERE WE WANT IT
gybFB6ULTlo_2 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MARK WHERE WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE HEM
gybFB6ULTlo_3 0 AND AS YOU CAN SEE ON THIS ONE IT'S BEEN SURGED TO BIND THE SEAM BUT WE DON'T WANT TO USE OUR SURGER TODAY
gybFB6ULTlo_4 0 AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE THIS WILL BE REALLY GOOD FOR YOU CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE THAT
gybFB6ULTlo_5 0 AND THIS HEM IS TURNED UNDER ONE INCH AND I THINK I'LL MAKE MINE A LITTLE BIT LONGER MAYBE ONE AND A FOURTH BECAUSE INSTEAD OF THIS I WANT TO HAVE TO TURN UNDER THAT HEM JUST LIKE THIS
gybFB6ULTlo_6 0 SO I WANT A LITTLE EXTRA ROOM TO TURN UNDER
gybFB6ULTlo_7 0 SO I'M GOING TO DO ONE AND A QUARTER AFTER THE BOTTOM MARK FOR THE CUFF
gybFB6ULTlo_8 0 SO LET ME JUST GO AROUND AND MARK THAT
gybFB6ULTlo_9 0 WE'LL JUST KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE THE VERY BOTTOM THAT WE TURN UNDER
gybFB6ULTlo_10 0 AND I'M GOING TO MARK THIS ONE BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE EXACTLY WHERE THAT ONE'S AT
gybFB6ULTlo_11 0 REMEMBER WE DO IT ALL THE WAY AROUND ONE LEG AT A TIME
gybFB6ULTlo_12 0 HERE WE GO
gybFB6ULTlo_13 0 THEN WE MARK THIS ONE ALSO
gybFB6ULTlo_14 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO INSTEAD OF USING THE BLIND STITCH OR THE INVISIBLE HEM AS THEY CALL IT ALSO THIS REMEMBER WHEN WE TURN IT UNDER AND YOU COULDN'T SEE THAT
gybFB6ULTlo_15 0 WELL THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE A TOP STITCH BUT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE IT'LL BE HIDDEN BY THE CUFF AND LIKE YOU WON'T EVEN SEE IT IN THERE
gybFB6ULTlo_16 0 IT'S PRETTY STANDARD TO DO THAT WHEN PEOPLE DO ALTERATIONS
gybFB6ULTlo_17 0 SO I'M STILL MARKING IT ONE AND A FOURTH INCH UP FROM THE BOTTOM CUFF MARK
gybFB6ULTlo_18 0 I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER
gybFB6ULTlo_19 0 ONE MORE LEG TO GO
gybFB6ULTlo_20 0 AND AFTER THIS WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND JUST CUT THE EXCESS FABRIC OFF AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THAT IN THE NEXT CLIP
HG2CWTX6w8U_1 0 OKAY WE'VE DONE SMALL OF THE BACK AND UNDER THE ARM AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO GET INTO WHAT WE CONSIDER THE ANKLE HOLSTER
HG2CWTX6w8U_2 0 NORMALLY YOU USE A VERY SMALL CALIBER 22 OR 32 OR 25 OR 38 THIS HAPPENS TO BE A 38 SUB NOSE WHICH IS A SMALLER REVOLVER AND IS SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT ON AN ADULT SIZE MAN'S ANKLE PROBABLY UNDETECTED DEPENDING ON WHAT TYPE OF PANTS OR SHOES THEY ARE WEARING
HG2CWTX6w8U_3 0 IF YOU ARE WEARING COURT ROOM ATTIRE OR BUSINESS SUIT OF SOME SORT AND THE PANTS FIT LOOSELY YOU COULD ACTUALLY ATTACH THIS TO THE INSIDE OF YOUR ANKLE AND PUT YOUR PANTS OVER IT AND YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW
HG2CWTX6w8U_4 0 ONE OF THE DRAW BACKS IS IF YOU HAD TO RUN OR YOU KNOW BE PHYSICAL YOU'VE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT IT BUMPING AROUND
HG2CWTX6w8U_5 0 HOW IS IT SECURED
HG2CWTX6w8U_6 0 IS IT BY SNAP IS IT BY VELCRO
HG2CWTX6w8U_7 0 YOU GET TO RUNNING AROUND OR BEING PHYSICAL YOU MAY TAKE THE CHANCE OF LOSING IT BY WHICH FOR A CONCEALABLE WEAPON GREAT PLACE TO KEEP A SECOND WEAPON
HG2CWTX6w8U_8 0 I WOULD PREFER THIS OVER THE UNDER THE ARM DEFINITELY OVER THE SMALL OF THE BACK
HG2CWTX6w8U_9 0 I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND ANKLE HOLSTER TO CARRY BECAUSE IT IS UNDETECTED AGAIN
HG2CWTX6w8U_10 0 MOST PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT THAT
HG2CWTX6w8U_11 0 IF FOR SOME REASON YOUR MAIN WEAPON OR PRIMARY WEAPON GOES DOWN YOU GO TO THE ANKLE HOLSTER AND YOU CAN ACCESS IT EASILY
HG2CWTX6w8U_12 0 IT IS EASILY TO CONCEAL
HG2CWTX6w8U_13 0 THAT WOULD BE THE ANKLE HOLSTER
hfN1ax3s4ck_1 0 HI MY NAME IS TERI AND IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO MINIMIZE YOUR PORES
hfN1ax3s4ck_2 0 NOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE WHY SOME PARTS OF OUR FACE HAVE LARGER PORES ON THEM THAN OTHERS
hfN1ax3s4ck_3 0 NOW SOMETIMES IT'S HEREDITARY SOMETIMES IF WE HAD EXCESS ACNE WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER THAT CAN CAUSE LARGER PORES IN CERTAIN AREAS
hfN1ax3s4ck_4 0 BUT OFTEN FOR MOST OF US IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE EXTRA DIRT OR OIL IN THOSE AREAS AND THAT'S WHERE IT TENDS TO COLLECT USUALLY IN AROUND THE NOSE AREA OR THE FOREHEAD AND SOMETIMES THE JAW LINE AND CHIN AREA
hfN1ax3s4ck_5 0 THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE LARGER PORES
hfN1ax3s4ck_6 0 THERE'S LITERALLY HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET THAT WILL HELP WITH PORE MINIMIZING
hfN1ax3s4ck_7 0 NOW SOME OF THEM RANGE FROM VERY INEXPENSIVE TO QUITE EXPENSIVE
hfN1ax3s4ck_8 0 I'M GOING TO GO OVER A COUPLE OF OPTIONS WITH YOU
hfN1ax3s4ck_9 0 NOW OF COURSE THIS IS A STANDARD THING YOU SHOULD BE USING EVERY DAY
hfN1ax3s4ck_10 0 IT'S A TONER
hfN1ax3s4ck_11 0 NOW YOU CAN GET IT WITH ALCOHOL OR ALCOHOL-FREE
hfN1ax3s4ck_12 0 IF YOU HAVE QUITE DRY SKIN STAY AWAY FROM AN ALCOHOL BASED PRODUCT USE AN ALCOHOL-FREE TONER
hfN1ax3s4ck_13 0 THEN WE ALSO HAVE THE PORE MINIMIZING DAILY FACIAL WASH AND THAT COMES IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT BRANDS AND PRODUCTS
hfN1ax3s4ck_14 0 USUALLY THAT HAS SOME SORT OF SCRUB IN IT AND THAT JUST CLEANS OUT THOSE PORES TO TRY TO GET THEM TO SHRINK DOWN GET THE OIL AND DIRT OUT
hfN1ax3s4ck_15 0 WE ALSO HAVE PORE STRIPS MINIMIZING STRIPS
hfN1ax3s4ck_16 0 THOSE COME WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT BRANDS CARRY THOSE
hfN1ax3s4ck_17 0 THEY USUALLY FIT AROUND YOUR NOSE OR FOREHEAD AREA
hfN1ax3s4ck_18 0 WHEN YOU PEEL THEM OFF IT TAKES THE DIRT THAT'S BEEN IN THOSE PORES
hfN1ax3s4ck_19 0 PULLS EM RIGHT OUT
hfN1ax3s4ck_20 0 AND THEN YOU COULD ALSO INVEST IN A CHEAP OR EXPENSIVE IF YOU CHOOSE MICRO-DERMABRASION KIT AT HOME
hfN1ax3s4ck_21 0 THOSE ARE ALL THE RAGE THESE DAYS AND THEY REALLY DO WORK
hfN1ax3s4ck_22 0 USE THEM ONCE A WEEK AND YOU WILL SEE A RESULT WITHIN FOUR TO SIX WEEKS OF MINIMIZING OF YOUR PORES
hfN1ax3s4ck_23 0 NOW IF YOU WANT TO USE A PRODUCT JUST STRAIGHT FROM THE KITCHEN DON'T WANT TO SPEND ANY MONEY EGG WHITES
hfN1ax3s4ck_24 0 YOU WHIP UP YOUR EGG WHITES FROM AN EGG JUST PUT IT ON YOUR FACE LIKE A MASK
hfN1ax3s4ck_25 0 LET IT SIT AND DRY WASH IT OFF
hfN1ax3s4ck_26 0 YOU DO THAT ONCE A WEEK YOU SHOULD NOTICE AN IMPROVEMENT IN YOUR PORES AS WELL
gK6GyK71SgM_1 0 ONCE AGAIN MY NAME IS RITCHIE GREER FROM EXPERT VILLAGE AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SHOOTING A BASKETBALL
gK6GyK71SgM_2 0 I KNOW THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SHOOTING BUT LET'S DO A REFRESH COURSE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO PUT THE BALL IN THE BASKET
gK6GyK71SgM_3 0 I'M RIGHT HANDED SO I'M GOING TO PLACE MY HAND BEHIND THE BALL AS SUCH INTO THE GROOVE
gK6GyK71SgM_5 0 LEFT HAND GOES HERE TO HOLD THE BASKETBALL
gK6GyK71SgM_6 0 WHAT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THOUGH IS SHOOTING ISN'T JUST ABOUT YOUR ARMS WRIST AND FINGERS
gK6GyK71SgM_7 0 IT STARTS DOWN TO YOUR FEET AND TRAVELS ALL THE WAY UP YOUR KNEES UP TO GET THAT ONE MOTION AND YOU FALL THROUGH
gK6GyK71SgM_8 0 MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT FADING AWAY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
gK6GyK71SgM_9 0 I GUARANTY YOU YOUR SHOOTING PERCENTAGE WOULD GO THROUGH THE ROOF ONCE YOU USE THESE SIMPLE RULES
gK6GyK71SgM_10 0 UNDER CONTROL MOTION FROM YOUR FEET ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH HERE THROUGH YOUR ELBOW THROUGH YOUR HANDS AND FOLLOW THROUGH OFF THESE FINGERTIPS
gK6GyK71SgM_11 0 NOW THAT YOU'VE GOT A REFRESH COURSE ON THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO MORE ADVANCED TECHNIQUES
gEtTXn_UJQg_1 0 HI I'M CHRIS FAIRCLOTH ARTISTIC DIRECTOR AND C-OWNER OF SALON TEEZ
gEtTXn_UJQg_2 0 FOR EXPERT VILLAGE THIS IS HOW TO TRIM WOMEN'S HAIR
gEtTXn_UJQg_3 0 WE'LL BE USING A HORIZONTAL TYPE OF SECTIONING FOR THIS
gEtTXn_UJQg_4 0 JUST FROM THE TOP OF THE EAR OR ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE EAR I'LL CREATE A STRAIGHT JUST COMING STRAIGHT ACROSS AND THIS GIVES US OUR HORIZONTAL SECTION
gEtTXn_UJQg_5 0 NOTICE MY FINGER ANGLE IS MORE IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION
gEtTXn_UJQg_6 0 IT MIRRORS THE SECTION THAT I JUST TOOK
gEtTXn_UJQg_7 0 AND NOW I'LL BE USING A PALM TO PALM CUTTING METHOD
gEtTXn_UJQg_8 0 THE REASON I WANT TO DO THIS IS IT KEEPS MY THUMB JUST SLIGHTLY IN THE THUMB HOLE AND IT ALLOWS ME NOT TO BEND MY WRIST SO THAT MY WRIST BECOMES UNSTABLE OR MY THUMB FITS ALL THE WAY INTO THE THUMB HOLE CREATING MORE OF A QUACKY MOTION
gEtTXn_UJQg_9 0 SO BY CUTTING PALM TO PALM I'M ABLE JUST TO CUT THE BLADE THAT I NEED TO USE
gEtTXn_UJQg_10 0 CUTTING PALM TO PALM MY CUTTING BLADE IS ACTUALLY ON TOP USING VERY LITTLE TENSION AND JUST SLIGHTLY TRIMMING THE HAIR OFF
gEtTXn_UJQg_11 0 NOW WE'VE GOT A NICE CLEAN BLUNT LINE
gEtTXn_UJQg_12 0 MOVE OVER TO THE NEXT SECTION AND MIRROR THE LINE THAT I CREATED ON THE RIGHT SIDE FOR THE LEFT SIDE
gEtTXn_UJQg_13 0 IT'S IMPORTANT THAT MY BODY POSITION IS IN FRONT OF THE HAIR THAT I'M ACTUALLY CUTTING
gEtTXn_UJQg_14 0 STANDING TO THE LEFT OR STANDING TO THE RIGHT MIGHT ACTUALLY INCREASE MY FINGER ANGLE OR GIVE ME MORE OF A SHORT TO LONG OR A LONG TO SHORT TYPE OF EFFECT
gEtTXn_UJQg_15 0 I DON'T NEED TO TAKE THAT WHOLE PIECE SO WHAT I'LL DO IS ACTUALLY SUBSECTION THAT SECTION SO THAT I CAN SEE WHERE MY GUIDE IS AND LINE THAT UP
gEtTXn_UJQg_16 0 MY GUIDE WILL ACTUALLY SLIP JUST SLIGHTLY THROUGH MY FINGERS AND I'LL BE ABLE TO CUT THE HAIR ON THE LEFT SIDE
gEtTXn_UJQg_17 0 SINCE I'M RIGHT HANDED AND I WORK RIGHT TO LEFT I'LL GO BACK TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND CREATE ANOTHER HORIZONTAL LINE SUB SECTIONING MY RIGHT BACK SECTION
gEtTXn_UJQg_18 0 IF YOU'RE A LEFT HANDER YOU MAY WANT TO START ON THE LEFT SIDE AS IT'S PROBABLY EASIER TO WORK LEFT TO RIGHT FOR YOU GUYS
gEtTXn_UJQg_19 0 PLACE MY COMB IN THE SIDE OF THE HEAD OR THE SIDE BACK OF THE HEAD AND SEE WHERE THE COMB STARTS TO COME OFF OF THE HEAD FOR ME
gEtTXn_UJQg_20 0 THERE I'LL VISUALLY SEE WHERE I NEED TO CREATE MY NEXT SECTION AND JUST SLIGHTLY PLACE MY COMB IN AND BRING THAT OVER SO THAT I CREATE MY HORIZONTAL LINE HERE AS WELL
gEtTXn_UJQg_21 0 I CAN LIFT THE HAIR UP AND SEE THAT MY GUIDE OF THE PREVIOUSLY CUT HAIR IS RIGHT UNDERNEATH THAT
gEtTXn_UJQg_22 0 I WANT TO HAVE THAT JUST SLIP SLIGHTLY INTO MY FINGERS AND NOW CUTTING PALM TO PALM AGAIN CUT THE HAIR THAT HANGS DOWN
gEtTXn_UJQg_23 0 BECAUSE THE TOP SECTION IS JUST A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN THE TWO SECTIONS THAT WE HAD IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD I CAN JUST COMPLETELY DROP THIS SECTION DOWN AND COMB THE HAIR IN ITS NATURAL FALL
gEtTXn_UJQg_24 0 THIS HAIR WON'T NECESSARILY COME ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK SO JUST COMB IT IN ITS NATURAL FALL
gEtTXn_UJQg_25 0 THIS WAY IT PREVENTS ANY SHORT TO LONG OR LONG TO SHORT
gEtTXn_UJQg_26 0 AGAIN I SEE WHERE MY GUIDE IS I SIMPLY LET THAT SLIP BETWEEN MY FINGERS AND THAT WOULD TOTALLY CUT THE BACK AND JUST TRIM IT WHERE WE HAVE A NICE HARD EDGE OR NICE HARD PERIMETER LINE BLUNT LINE FOR THE BACK OF THE HEAD
GzfISwvInt8_1 0 PIMPLES ARE CAUSED BY BLOCKAGES IN YOUR PORES WHICH SHOW UP AS SWOLLEN BUMPS
GzfISwvInt8_2 0 I'M JACKIE SILVER FROM AGING BACKWARDS WITH HOW TO AVOID PIMPLES
GzfISwvInt8_3 0 MOST PEOPLE GET A PIMPLE NOW AND THEN BUT RECURRING OR MULTIPLE PIMPLES ARE TERMED ACNE
GzfISwvInt8_4 0 FOR SEVERE OR PAINFUL PIMPLES ALWAYS CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR
GzfISwvInt8_5 0 THERE ARE WAYS TO AVOID GETTING PIMPLES AND KEEPING YOUR FACE EXFOLIATED IS YOUR FIRST DEFENSE
GzfISwvInt8_6 0 PIMPLES FORM WHEN DEAD SKIN CELLS ATTEMPT TO SLOUGH OFF BUT THEY CAN'T BECAUSE THEY'RE BLOCKED FROM THE PORES
GzfISwvInt8_7 0 THESE BLOCKAGES ARE COMMONLY CAUSED BY OVERPRODUCTION OF OIL BY THE SEBACEOUS GLANDS WHICH NORMALLY WORK TO KEEP THE SKIN HEALTHY
GzfISwvInt8_8 0 DIRT AND INFECTION IN THE PORE CAN LEAD TO BLOCKAGE
GzfISwvInt8_9 0 TO AVOID GETTING PIMPLES GENTLY EXFOLIATE THE SKIN WITH A PRODUCT SPECIFICALLY FORMULATED FOR OILY OR COMBINATION SKIN
GzfISwvInt8_10 0 USING A MUD MASK ONCE A WEEK CAN ALSO HELP KEEP THE SKIN CLEAN
GzfISwvInt8_11 0 AVOIDING STRESS IS ANOTHER EFFECTIVE WAY TO AVOID PIMPLES AND ALSO AVOID TOUCHING YOUR FACE TOO OFTEN ESPECIALLY IF YOUR HANDS ARE DIRTY
GzfISwvInt8_12 0 FOR WOMEN WASHING YOUR MAKEUP BRUSHES AND SPONGES FREQUENTLY WILL HELP MINIMIZE DIRT AND BACTERIA THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO PIMPLES
GzfISwvInt8_13 0 REMEMBER TO AVOID PIMPLES KEEP YOUR FACE CLEAN AND REMEMBER TO EXFOLIATE GENTLY
GzfISwvInt8_14 0 USE PRODUCTS FORMULATED FOR OILY OR COMBINATION SKIN AND TRY TO AVOID TOUCHING YOUR FACE TOO OFTEN
GzfISwvInt8_15 0 I'M JACKIE SILVER WITH HOW TO AVOID PIMPLES
GQ-555yyNsM_1 0 HI I'M DOUG
GQ-555yyNsM_2 0 I WORK WITH TWENTY GREAT GUYS IN ST LOUIS AT DOUG JENKINS CUSTOM HOT RODS AND WE'RE GONNA DO SOME WORK FOR YOU TODAY ON EXPERT VILLAGE
GQ-555yyNsM_3 0 NOW WE'RE GONNA REPAIR A BROKEN BOLT IN A 63 CADILLAC WATER PASSAGE BYPASS TO THE HOUSING
GQ-555yyNsM_4 0 THE 63 CADILLAC IS ESPECIALLY NOTORIOUS FOR LEAKS ON THAT FITTING RIGHT THERE IN THE CENTER WHERE IT PLUGS INTO THE ENGINE
GQ-555yyNsM_5 0 BUT THIS ONE WE NEED TO REPLACE THE THERMOSTAT
GQ-555yyNsM_6 0 AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE NEED TO GET THE THERMOSTAT HOUSING OFF
GQ-555yyNsM_7 0 THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS WHEN PULLING THAT HOUSING OFF THE BOLT BROKE
GQ-555yyNsM_8 0 SO WE'RE GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO REMOVE THAT BROKEN BOLT THAT'S DOWN IN THE HOLE AND WE'RE GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO CAREFULLY REMOVE THE OTHER BOLT IN AN ATTEMPT NOT TO BREAK IT OFF
GQ-555yyNsM_9 0 YOU'LL HAVE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES AS YOU WORK ON OLD CARS TO DEAL WITH BROKEN BOLTS ESPECIALLY IN WATER PASSAGES WHERE THEY CORRODE IN THERE
h6JQJCzdpRs_1 0 THE NEXT THING WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS IS THE HEATING FOR YOUR SAND BOA
h6JQJCzdpRs_2 0 SAND BOAS ARE REPTILES
h6JQJCzdpRs_3 0 ALL REPTILES DO NEED HEAT TO SOME DEGREE OR ANOTHER
h6JQJCzdpRs_4 0 AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAT OUR SAND BOA IS WITH A HEAT PAD AND SOME HEAT LAMPS
h6JQJCzdpRs_5 0 NOW THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DO IT AS WELL LIKE RADIANT HEAT PANELS OR HEAT TAPE HEAT CORD THINGS LIKE THAT
h6JQJCzdpRs_6 0 BUT THEY'RE NOT AS READILY AVAILABLE IN THE PET INDUSTRY AND SO MAYBE HARDER FOR YOU TO GET YOUR HANDS ON
h6JQJCzdpRs_7 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HEAT LAMPS
h6JQJCzdpRs_8 0 NOW IN ORDER TO DO THIS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IS YOU'RE GOING TO NEED ONE HEAT LAMP
h6JQJCzdpRs_10 0 AND THAT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT HAS A CERAMIC TOP ON IT
h6JQJCzdpRs_12 0 IT NEEDS TO BE CERAMIC NOT PLASTIC
h6JQJCzdpRs_13 0 PLASTIC WILL MELT AND CAUSE A FIRE HAZARD
h6JQJCzdpRs_14 0 ALSO YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LAMP IS RATED FOR THE AMOUNT OF WATTAGE YOU'RE GOING TO USE
h6JQJCzdpRs_15 0 AS YOU CAN SEE THIS ONE IS RATED FOR 150 WATTS WHICH SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE CARE OF IS IN A FIFTEEN GALLON TANK
h6JQJCzdpRs_16 0 WE'LL GET TO TEMPERATURES IN A SECOND AND WHAT TEMPERATURES WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO BUT 150 WATTS SHOULD TAKE CARE OF YOU FOR THE MOST PART
h6JQJCzdpRs_17 0 NOW THIS LAMP IS GOING TO GO ON ONE SIDE OF YOUR AQUARIUM JUST LIKE YOU SEE THERE
h6JQJCzdpRs_19 0 FOR THAT LAMP TO WORK YOU NEED A HEAT BULB
h6JQJCzdpRs_20 0 NOW I RECOMMEND THE RED HEAT BULBS BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE THIS ON TWENTY-FOUR SEVEN
h6JQJCzdpRs_21 0 YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO TURN THIS OFF
h6JQJCzdpRs_22 0 THIS IS ALSO A SPOT BULB WHICH MEANS IT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU A TIGHT BEAM OF HEAT GOING STRAIGHT DOWN FROM THE BULB OK
h6JQJCzdpRs_23 0 YOU WILL GET RADIANT HEAT OUT OF IT BUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO IS CREATE A HOT SPOT FOR YOU OK IN THE SIDE OF YOUR AQUARIUM
h6JQJCzdpRs_24 0 SO THIS IS GOING TO GO INSIDE YOUR LAMP RIGHT AND IT'S GOING TO CREATE A HOT SPOT RIGHT BELOW IT
h6JQJCzdpRs_25 0 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF YOUR AQUARIUM YOU'RE GOING TO USE A HEAT PAD
h6JQJCzdpRs_26 0 NOW A HEAT PAD IS GOING TO BE AN ADHESIVE IT'S SELF-ADHESIVE STRIP OK JUST LIKE THIS
h6JQJCzdpRs_27 0 YOU PULL OFF THE PLASTIC BACKING
h6JQJCzdpRs_28 0 THIS GOES UNDERNEATH THE AQUARIUM ON THE OUTSIDE
h6JQJCzdpRs_29 0 IT DOES NOT GO INSIDE THE AQUARIUM
h6JQJCzdpRs_30 0 IT ALSO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK COMES WITH THESE LITTLE RUBBER FEET
h6JQJCzdpRs_31 0 THESE FEET NEED TO BE PLACED ON THE AQUARIUM
h6JQJCzdpRs_32 0 AND WE'LL GET TO THAT IN JUST A SECOND
gsit1xgHHWE_2 0 I'M MICHAEL LAMENDOLA WITH EXPERTVILLAGE.COM AND WE ARE HERE AT FANTASIA BILLIARDS IN BURBANK CALIFORNIA AND TODAY I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PLAY SOME POOL

gsit1xgHHWE_7 0 THERE'S A STRAIGHT END SHOT THERE'S THE BANK SHOT THERE'S THE KICK SHOT THERE'S THE COMBINATION SHOT THERE'S A SHOT OFF ONE BALL THERE'S A SNOOKER SHOT THERE'S A SAFETY SHOT AND THEN THERE'S A SCRATCH SHOT
gsit1xgHHWE_8 0 YOU ARE NOT GOING TO LIKE THAT ONE SO MUCH BUT IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN EVENTUALLY

gsit1xgHHWE_10 0 SO GRAB YOUR POOL CUE
gsit1xgHHWE_11 0 LET'S PLAY SOME POOL
Hiri9RuDjec_1 0 BEN ANDERSON HI
Hiri9RuDjec_2 0 I'M BEN ANDERSON WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT IN LIVE KEYBOARD SETTING
Hiri9RuDjec_3 0 A LOT OF KEYBOARDISTS A LOT OF MUSICIANS TEND TO FEEL WHEN THEY'RE PLAYING IN A LIVE BAND THAT THEY NEED TO BE PLAYING ALL THE TIME AND THAT REALLY REALLY ISN'T ALWAYS THE CASE
Hiri9RuDjec_4 0 IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WHAT'S APPROPRIATE IN THIS SITUATION OF THE SONG AND THAT'S DETERMINED [CUT 00 26 00 31] WHEN I PLAY KEYBOARDS THAT I DON'T PLAY ON STAGE WHILE THE OTHER MUSICIANS ARE PLAYING AND THAT'S BECAUSE BY PLAYING KEYBOARD I'M NOT REALLY ADDING ANYTHING EXTRA TO THE SONG AND TO THE SOUND OF THE PIECE AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT
Hiri9RuDjec_5 0 IT'S NOT TO SAY THE KEYBOARD ISN'T IMPORTANT AND KEYBOARD SHOULDN'T BE PLAYED BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO DETERMINE WHEN KEYBOARD IS APPROPRIATE AND WHEN IT'S NOT
Hiri9RuDjec_6 0 FOR EXAMPLE DURING ONE SONG OF MY BANDS THERE'S A MOMENT WHERE THE SONG GETS KINDA QUIET AND REALLY KIND OF RHYTHMIC AND IT'S HARD FOR ME TO FIT ALONG WITH THAT WITH THE REST OF THE INSTRUMENTS DURING THE SONG JUST BECAUSE OF THE STYLE OF THE SONG SO I CUT OUT AND I DON'T PLAY AND IT'S ONLY FOR A FEW MEASURES AND IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER TO ME
Hiri9RuDjec_7 0 IT GIVES ME A MOMENT TO SIT AND THINK AND REMEMBER WHAT I HAVE TO DO LATER ON IN THE SONG
Hiri9RuDjec_8 0 SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK OF WHAT IS REALLY NECESSARY TO THAT SONG
Hiri9RuDjec_9 0 JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN PLAY AND YOU CAN PLAY ANYTHING DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO PLAY ALL THE TIME
Hiri9RuDjec_10 0 AGAIN IT'S ALL ABOUT EMPHASIZING AND SUPPORTING THE SONG AND SUPPORTING THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY THERE
Hiri9RuDjec_11 0 WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THE SONG
Hiri9RuDjec_12 0 IT'S NOT IMPORTANT AS WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING AND WHAT YOU'RE NECESSARILY CONTRIBUTING TO IT
Hiri9RuDjec_13 0 IT'S ALL ABOUT ADDING EVERYTHING INTO TO FIT IN AND TO MAKE A PERFECT SONG
Hiri9RuDjec_14 0 THERE ARE OTHER MOMENTS WHEN YOU MIGHT BE PLAYING ALONG WITH THE BAND AND FOR SOME REASON IT DOESN'T REALLY SOUND RIGHT OR IT MIGHT SOUND CLUTTERED IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE THERE'S TOO MUCH GOING ON AND THAT'S ANOTHER WAY TO SHOW THAT MAYBE YOU PLAYING THERE REALLY ISN'T APPROPRIATE WITH THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS
Hiri9RuDjec_15 0 IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WHAT EVERY OTHER INSTRUMENT IS DOING BY ITSELF COMPARED TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING AS WELL
GSTkDCgtqdQ_1 0 OKAY NOW LETS TALK ABOUT WHAT TO DO IF YOUR SEED DON'T COME UP OR EQUALLY AS COMMON IF TOO MANY SEED COME UP
GSTkDCgtqdQ_2 0 COMMON PROBLEM PEOPLE GET OVER ENTHUSIASTIC THEY PLANT TOO MANY SEED
GSTkDCgtqdQ_3 0 AND ALSO ANOTHER COMMON PROBLEM PEOPLE GET EITHER OVER ANXIOUS OR NERVOUS AND THEY THINK THEIR SEED IS DEAD AND HASN'T COME UP IS NOT GOING TO GERMINATE
GSTkDCgtqdQ_4 0 WELL OFTEN TIMES ESPECIALLY IN THE COOL NIGHTS OF EARLY SPRING IF YOUR SEED IS OUT HERE THE GERMINATION WILL BE SLIGHTLY RETARDED SO YOU NEED TO GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE TIME
GSTkDCgtqdQ_5 0 IF IN DOUBT YOU CAN APPLY SOME HEAT TO THE BOTTOMS OF THE POTS BUT IN GENERAL THESE COLD HEARTY CROPS WILL GERMINATE JUST FINE IN MARCH EVEN IN NEW ENGLAND
GSTkDCgtqdQ_6 0 SO LET'S TALK ABOUT TOO MANY
GSTkDCgtqdQ_7 0 HERE WE SEE A POT OF ARUGULA
GSTkDCgtqdQ_8 0 A LITTLE FROST DAMAGE BUT THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF LIVING ARUGULA IN THERE
GSTkDCgtqdQ_9 0 I'M AN EX-ARUGULA HATER NOW CONVERTED
GSTkDCgtqdQ_10 0 THE WAY TO LEARN TO LIKE ARUGULA IS TO EAT IT IN THE WINTER
GSTkDCgtqdQ_11 0 IT'S MUCH TASTIER SWEET AND DELICIOUS AND NOT SO PEPPERY
GSTkDCgtqdQ_12 0 SO HERE WE HAVE MAYBE A HUNDRED OR MORE PLANTS
GSTkDCgtqdQ_13 0 WE DON'T WANT TO WASTE THEM THERE'S NOT ENOUGH SPACE IN THERE FOR THEM ALL TO DEVELOP SO YOU CAN SEE THIS IS PRACTICALLY ROOT BOUND
GSTkDCgtqdQ_14 0 WE CAN EASILY SUB-DIVIDE THE CLUMPS AND TAKE THIS AND TURN IT INTO ONE CLUMP
HbkcT1XzmAk_1 0 MY NAME IS ANTHONY MADDALONI AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO START A SMALL BUSINESS IN PHOTOGRAPHY
HbkcT1XzmAk_2 0 NOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A SMALL BUSINESS IN PHOTOGRAPHY YOU PROBABLY THINK ABOUT WELL I CAN BECOME AN EVENT PHOTOGRAPHER OR I CAN TAKE IMAGES OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BECOME MODELS OR I CAN TAKE IMAGES OF PEOPLE AND THEIR PETS
HbkcT1XzmAk_3 0 SO THERE'S ALL TYPES OF WAYS THAT YOU COULD START A SMALL BUSINESS IN PHOTOGRAPHY
HbkcT1XzmAk_4 0 THE ONE THING THAT YOU ALSO WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS OF STARTING A SMALL BUSINESS
HbkcT1XzmAk_5 0 DO YOU WANT TO GO DOWN AND GET BASICALLY A SMALL BUSINESS LICENSE FOR YOUR TAX PURPOSES
HbkcT1XzmAk_6 0 YOU REALLY WANT TO AT FIRST THINK ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT BECAUSE IF YOUR SMALL BUSINESS TAKES OFF AND YOU'RE NOT REALLY A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS YOU MIGHT RUN INTO SOME LEGAL PROBLEMS DOWN THE ROAD
HbkcT1XzmAk_7 0 SO THAT'S ONE INSTANCE YOU MIGHT SORT OF THINK ABOUT HOW TO START A SMALL BUSINESS
HbkcT1XzmAk_8 0 THE OTHER IS RESEARCH
HbkcT1XzmAk_9 0 DO SOME RESEARCH INTO OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES IN YOUR AREA
HbkcT1XzmAk_10 0 NOW THEY CAN BE PHOTOGRAPHY BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE
HbkcT1XzmAk_11 0 THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT SMALL BUSINESSES WORK AND FOR ME ONE THING THAT I LIKE TO LOOK AT ARE SMALL RESTAURANTS MOM AND POP SHOPS
HbkcT1XzmAk_12 0 HOW DID THEY START UP
HbkcT1XzmAk_13 0 HOW MUCH MONEY DID THEY NEED
HbkcT1XzmAk_14 0 WHAT KIND OF INSURANCE DO THEY NEED
HbkcT1XzmAk_15 0 WHAT KIND OF STAFF DID THEY HAVE
HbkcT1XzmAk_16 0 HOW DEDICATED AND HOW ORGANIZED WHERE THEY WHEN THEY STARTED
HbkcT1XzmAk_17 0 AND THERE'S REALLY THERE'S A PRETTY BIG DIFFERENCE IN STARTING LET'S SAY A DINER AND STARTING A PHOTOGRAPHY BUSINESS BUT WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT IT THERE'S REALLY NOT THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE
HbkcT1XzmAk_18 0 IT'S A LOT OF ADVERTISING A LOT OF WORD OF MOUTH A LOT OF REALLY PROFESSIONALISM AND JUST WHAT GOES ON WITH YOUR INTERACTION WITH YOUR CLIENTS
HbkcT1XzmAk_19 0 AND SO AND IT'S ALSO INCREDIBLY HARD
HbkcT1XzmAk_20 0 MOST RESTAURANTS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EXACT PERCENTAGE IS BUT THEY FAIL
HbkcT1XzmAk_21 0 THEY DON'T REALLY IT'S A TOUGH BUSINESS AND SO IS PHOTOGRAPHY
HbkcT1XzmAk_22 0 IT LOOKS FUN AND WOW I'M GOING TO GET PAID FOR DOING SOMETHING THAT I LOVE TO DO FOR FUN
HbkcT1XzmAk_23 0 AND WHEN YOU REALLY GET INTO THE BUSINESS ASPECT OF IT IT'S NOT REALLY FUN
HbkcT1XzmAk_24 0 IT'S A LOT OF WORK WHICH FOR SOME PEOPLE IS FUN
HbkcT1XzmAk_25 0 FOR ME WORK IS FUN
HbkcT1XzmAk_26 0 BUT IT'S REALLY THE BASIC FOUNDATIONS OF HOW TO START ANY SMALL BUSINESS
HbkcT1XzmAk_27 0 THERE ARE GREAT BOOKS AT LIBRARIES ON HOW TO REALLY I THINK THERE'S EVEN A HOW TO START A SMALL BUSINESS BOOK
HbkcT1XzmAk_28 0 AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT THESE WHERE FAIRLY USELESS TO ME BUT WHEN I LOOKED AT THEM THEY WERE REALLY IMPORTANT
HbkcT1XzmAk_29 0 AND AGAIN IT WAS RESEARCH AND TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE THAT STARTED SMALL BUSINESSES
HbkcT1XzmAk_30 0 NOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO REALLY WANT TO TALK TO THE PHOTOGRAPHER THAT YOU MIGHT BE COMPETING WITH BECAUSE HE'S NOT OR SHE'S NOT REALLY GOING TO TELL YOU YEAH DO IT
HbkcT1XzmAk_31 0 THAT WOULD BE GREAT
HbkcT1XzmAk_32 0 EVEN THOUGH COMPETITION IS PRETTY GOOD SOMETIMES FOR CERTAIN I THINK PHOTOGRAPHY I THINK COMPETITION IN PHOTOGRAPHY IS AN AWESOME THING
HbkcT1XzmAk_33 0 BUT ANYWAY YOU WANT TO LOOK AT OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES IN YOUR AREA AND HOW THEY STARTED
HbkcT1XzmAk_34 0 AND THEN THAT'S HOW I WOULD START A SMALL BUSINESS IN PHOTOGRAPHY
hiqk6x1HnHU_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO TALK A FEW TIMES A FEW MORE TIMES ABOUT THE WILLARD FAMILY AND MENTION VARIOUS NAMES AND WHAT THEY DID
hiqk6x1HnHU_2 0 EARLY ON HOWEVER THEY WERE OUT THERE IN THE COUNTRY
hiqk6x1HnHU_3 0 THEY WEREN'T MAKING TOO MANY CLOCKS FOR RICH PEOPLE IN THE CITIES
hiqk6x1HnHU_4 0 SO A BIG A BIG INCENTIVE FOR THEM WAS TO TRY TO MAKE CLOCKS THAT WERE INEXPENSIVE
hiqk6x1HnHU_5 0 THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THAT RICH TO OWN
hiqk6x1HnHU_6 0 THEY WERE AN INVENTIVE FAMILY
hiqk6x1HnHU_7 0 THE OUT THERE IN THE COUNTRY NOT NOT UNDER THE THE PRESSURES OF CITY LIFE AND THEY COULD THINK ABOUT HOW THEY COULD DO AN INEXPENSIVE CLOCK
hiqk6x1HnHU_8 0 THIS IS CALLED THE GRAFTON TIMEPIECE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY WERE WORKING UP THERE AT THEIR HOMESTEAD WHOSE PICTURE YOU SAW
hiqk6x1HnHU_9 0 GRAFTON TIMEPIECE THESE ARE RARE AND EXPENSIVE
hiqk6x1HnHU_10 0 AGAIN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND THESE AT A FLEA MARKET
hiqk6x1HnHU_11 0 AND IF ONE COMES UP FOR SALE IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE MANY MANY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
hiqk6x1HnHU_12 0 BUT YOU SHOULD AT LEAST KNOW WHAT IT IS AND KNOW TO APPRECIATE IT WHEN YOU SEE ONE SOMEWHERE
hiqk6x1HnHU_13 0 THE ONE THING YOU MAY NOTICE IS THE FORM
hiqk6x1HnHU_14 0 IF YOU LOOK FROM HERE ON UP YOU BASICALLY HAVE A BRACKET CLOCK
hiqk6x1HnHU_15 0 SO THEY THEY WERE WORKING FROM THAT MODEL OF A BRACKET CLOCK
hiqk6x1HnHU_16 0 BUT MAIN SPRINGS WERE EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT TO MANUFACTURE
hiqk6x1HnHU_17 0 SO THEY WERE STILL DEALING WITH WEIGHT DRIVEN CLOCKS OF WEIGHT HANGING UNDERNEATH THE CLOCK WHICH POWERS IT
hiqk6x1HnHU_18 0 SO THEY NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING UNDERNEATH BOTH AS A DECORATIVE FEATURE AND TO ENCLOSE THE WEIGHT INSIDE SO IT WASN'T OUT SWINGING IN THE AIR
hiqk6x1HnHU_19 0 THIS IS AGAIN AS I TALKED ABOUT YOU CAN TELL IMMEDIATELY THIS IS A SINGLE WINDER
hiqk6x1HnHU_20 0 SO THIS IS A TIME PIECE AND THEY'RE SOMETIMES CALLED GRAFTON TIMEPIECES
hiqk6x1HnHU_21 0 BUT THEN YOU'LL SAY WAIT A MINUTE BOB YOU TOLD ME YOUR TIMEPIECE DOESN'T STRIKE AND I SEE A HAMMER AND BELL UP THERE
hiqk6x1HnHU_22 0 THE WAY THESE WORKED WAS SORT OF A PART WAY TO BE A STRIKING CLOCK BUT WITHOUT ALL THE EXTRA EXPENSE
hiqk6x1HnHU_23 0 THIS THEY HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A PASSING STRIKE WITH THE OUT WHEN THE MINUTE HAND PASS THE HOUR IT WOULD JUST LIFT THE HAMMER UP AND LET IT FALL ON THE BELL ONE TIME
hiqk6x1HnHU_24 0 SO YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TIME IT WAS BUT YOU KNEW THAT ANOTHER HOUR OF YOUR LIFE HAD JUST PASSED BY
grp-q-hxxeQ_2 0 THIS JOHN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
grp-q-hxxeQ_3 0 IN THIS VIDEO CLIP I WILL SHOW YOU PART ONE OF FIXING A LEAKY SILLCOCK
grp-q-hxxeQ_4 0 A SILLCOCK IS A TECHNICAL NAME FOR YOUR FAUCET OUTSIDE
grp-q-hxxeQ_5 0 SO ANYTIME YOU WANT TO GO TO A HARDWARE STORE LOOKING FOR PARTS IF YOU REFER TO IT AS A SILLCOCK THEY WILL BE MORE FULLY ABLE TO DIRECT YOU WHERE THOSE PARTS ARE
grp-q-hxxeQ_6 0 NOW IN MOST HOUSES THERE IS A SILLCOCK LOCATED IN THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND ONE LOCATED IN THE REAR AS WELL
grp-q-hxxeQ_7 0 NOW INSIDE THESE SILLCOCKS THERE'S JUST A FEW DIFFERENT WORKINGS
grp-q-hxxeQ_8 0 THE MAIN ONE WHEN I PULL THIS THING APART IS THERE WILL BE A LONG BAR IN THE CENTER OF IT AND THERE WILL BE A WASHER AND THIS IS REALLY WHAT WE ARE GOING TO WANT TO LOOK FOR
HIRQLSfYWEg_1 0 YOU SEE ONE OF THE MOST BASIC AND IMPORTANT POINTS IN MAKING A TALK IS TO COMMUNICATE
HIRQLSfYWEg_2 0 AND IF YOU BE QUIET IN YOUR TALK IF YOU CLAP UP WITH YOUR VOICE IF YOU'RE REALLY REALLY TOO SHY SO THAT YOU CAN'T SPEAK OUT EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE LEANING OVER AND WONDERING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
HIRQLSfYWEg_3 0 AND IT'S JUST AS BAD AS THAT CONSTRUCTION GUY HAMMERING ON HIS HAMMER AND INTERFERING WITH EVERY WORD THAT YOU HAVE TO SAY
HIRQLSfYWEg_4 0 SO ONCE AGAIN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR AUDIENCE IS INTERESTED IN WHAT WE'RE SAYING SO WE WANT TO SPEAK OUT LOUDER
HIRQLSfYWEg_5 0 IS THAT BETTER
HIRQLSfYWEg_8 0 YEAH WE AGREE GOOD GOOD SHOW GREAT GREAT
_Gy2B1z9lJk_1 0 WE'VE JUST TALKED ABOUT PADDLING ON EDGE IN A CIRCLE BUT WHEN YOU GO DOWN THE RIVER YOU DON'T ALWAYS GO IN ONE DIRECTION
_Gy2B1z9lJk_2 0 SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SWITCH DIRECTIONS THE OTHER WAY SO YOU CAN CIRCLE IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
_Gy2B1z9lJk_3 0 IT'S CALLED SWITCHING EDGES IT'S REALLY ALL ABOUT TIMING AND LOOKING WHERE YOU WANT TO GO
_Gy2B1z9lJk_4 0 SO I'M GOING TO PADDLE AWAY FROM YOU AND I'M GOING TO DO A FIGURE EIGHT
_Gy2B1z9lJk_5 0 IN THE CENTER OF THE FIGURE EIGHT I'M GOING TO SWITCH MY EDGE
_Gy2B1z9lJk_6 0 SO TAKE A LOOK BACK UP A LITTLE BIT
_Gy2B1z9lJk_7 0 I'M GOING TO COME ON BACK TO YOU AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS
_Gy2B1z9lJk_8 0 SO THE KEY TO SWITCHING EDGES IS DOING SOME SORT OF CORRECTIVE STROKE TO ACTUALLY TURN THE BOAT
_Gy2B1z9lJk_9 0 IN THIS CASE I'M DOING A FORWARD SWEEP
_Gy2B1z9lJk_10 0 I THEN LOOK WHERE I WANT TO GO AND SWITCH MY EDGES
_Gy2B1z9lJk_11 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU DO THAT CORRECTIVE STROKE FIRST BEFORE YOU SWITCH EDGES
_Gy2B1z9lJk_12 0 IF YOU DON'T IT COULD BE A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT FOR YOU YOU'LL STILL CURVE IN THAT SAME EDGE
_Gy2B1z9lJk_13 0 SO LET ME SHOW YOU STEP BY STEP WHAT I'M DOING AND I'LL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU
_Gy2B1z9lJk_14 0 HERE WE GO
_Gy2B1z9lJk_15 0 SO WHAT I DO IS START WITH THE FORWARD SWEEP I LOOK AND SWITCH AND THEN THE KEY THING IS PADDLE FORWARD SO KEEP THAT MOMENTUM INTO THE TURN
_Gy2B1z9lJk_16 0 SO PRACTICE SOME FIGURE 8'S ON THE POND TO GET GOOD AT IT OR YOU CAN HAVE YOUR FRIENDS DO A HUMAN SLALOM PRACTICE IN AND OUT OF THEM
_Gy2B1z9lJk_17 0 PERFECT PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT
Hch_k64nR2k_1 0 NOW WE HAVE OUR BUTTERFLY LOOKING PRETTY GOOD NOW WE ARE GOING TO WORK A LITTLE BIT HERE ON THE TAIL SECTION THE ABDOMEN AS IT WHERE
Hch_k64nR2k_2 0 FLIP IT OVER TO DO THIS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS PUT SOME CREASES AND FOLDS IN HERE
Hch_k64nR2k_3 0 GIVE IT THE APPEARANCE OF A BUTTERFLY ABDOMEN CREASE IT ALL UP HERE
Hch_k64nR2k_4 0 GIVE IT THAT REAL ORGANIC LOOK CAUSE WE DON'T WANT OUR PAPER TO LOOK ALL STIFF
Hch_k64nR2k_5 0 WE WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE A REAL BUTTERFLY
Hch_k64nR2k_6 0 HERE WE GO THAT SHOULD DO
Hch_k64nR2k_7 0 TAKE A LITTLE CHOPSTICK TO IT SO THE CREASES HOLD
Hch_k64nR2k_8 0 THERE WE GO NOW OUR CREASES ARE A LITTLE BIT BETTER
Hch_k64nR2k_9 0 PULL THIS JUST A LITTLE BIT MAKING IT LOOK THERE WE GO
Hch_k64nR2k_10 0 THERE WE GO WE HAVE THE TAIL FINISH
g50VFgOEKos_1 0 YOU KNOW I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SWIMMING POOL
g50VFgOEKos_2 0 I ABSOLUTELY HATE THE MANAGER OF THAT SWIMMING POOL
g50VFgOEKos_3 0 AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY BECAUSE IN MY MIND THIS MAN BELONGS TO THE ABSOLUTE DIRT OF THE EARTH
g50VFgOEKos_4 0 HE'S A SNAIL
g50VFgOEKos_5 0 HE'S A WORM
g50VFgOEKos_6 0 AND ONCE MORE WE SHOULDN'T BE SPENDING ONE MORE DIME ON ANYTHING ON THAT SWIMMING POOL UNTIL WE PROTECT OUR CHILDREN
g50VFgOEKos_7 0 NOW THAT'S MY PERSONAL OPINION
g50VFgOEKos_8 0 IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THAT I THINK YOU'D BETTER TAKE A SECOND CONSIDERATION ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT'S REALLY SERIOUS
g50VFgOEKos_9 0 IT'S VERY VERY SERIOUS
g50VFgOEKos_10 0 HOW DOES THAT COME ACROSS IN A TALK
g50VFgOEKos_11 0 YEAH MAYBE PRETTY STRONG BUT MAYBE TOO STRONG
g50VFgOEKos_12 0 WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE IT'S NEVER GOOD TO BE SO CONVINCING THAT WE COME ACROSS WITH STRONG POWERFUL EMOTIONS OF ANGER AND DISGUST ESPECIALLY
g50VFgOEKos_13 0 NOW OF COURSE YOU CAN BE POWERFUL AND YOU CAN BE CONVINCING ABOUT SOMETHING
g50VFgOEKos_14 0 YOU CAN HAVE VERY VERY STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT SOMETHING BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ANGRY
g50VFgOEKos_15 0 VERY VERY IMPORTANT A GOOD TALK ALWAYS CONVEYS A CERTAIN SENSE OF REASON BEHIND IT
g50VFgOEKos_16 0 REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IS COMMUNICATING
g50VFgOEKos_17 0 WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU WHEN SOMEBODY YELLS AT YOU
g50VFgOEKos_18 0 WELL I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO ME
g50VFgOEKos_19 0 THE VERY FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS TO ME IS I REACT IN A NEGATIVE FASHION
g50VFgOEKos_20 0 WHAT WAS THAT YOU WERE SAYING
g50VFgOEKos_21 0 DON'T TALK TO ME THAT WAY
g50VFgOEKos_22 0 THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE FEELING INSIDE
g50VFgOEKos_23 0 YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO THE MESSAGE
g50VFgOEKos_24 0 YOU'RE REACTING TO THE EMOTION
g50VFgOEKos_25 0 VERY VERY IMPORTANT
GUPTKqn6eWs_1 0 HI I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO A CHEST PRESS AS YOU ARE DOING A BRIDGE
GUPTKqn6eWs_2 0 WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE BODY ROLL IT OUT UNTIL YOU GET INTO A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR ANKLES YOUR KNEES AND YOUR HIPS ARE IN A STRAIGHT LINE
GUPTKqn6eWs_3 0 YOU ARE GOING TO BRING YOUR FREE WEIGHTS UP
GUPTKqn6eWs_4 0 YOUR FREE WEIGHTS STARTING WEIGHT IS FIVE TO EIGHT POUNDS YOU CAN GO UP HEAVIER IF YOU NEED TO
GUPTKqn6eWs_5 0 WE ARE GOING TO PULL THE ELBOWS OPEN AS YOU PRESS UP YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT NOT LOCKING THE ELBOWS KEEP THE JOINTS SLIGHTLY BENT
GUPTKqn6eWs_6 0 AS YOU COME DOWN YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ELBOWS DO NOT COMPLETELY OPEN SO WE WANT TO KEEP THEM ALMOST IN LINE WITH THE SHOULDERS KEEP THE BRIDGE UP
GUPTKqn6eWs_7 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR BOTTOM DOESN'T DROP PUTTING PRESSURE ON YOUR LOWER BACK
GUPTKqn6eWs_8 0 KEEP THE GLUTS ENGAGED THE HIPS IN LINE WITH THE KNEES AND WE ARE JUST SLOWLY PRESSING UP AND DOWN
GUPTKqn6eWs_9 0 FORM IS REALLY IMPORTANT ON THIS ONE SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR HEAD AND YOUR SHOULDERS ARE ON THE BALL
GUPTKqn6eWs_10 0 WE DON'T WANT TO BE UP HERE WHERE YOUR LOWER BACK IS ON THE BALL AS YOU ARE PUSHING UP BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO BE PUTTING A LOT OF RESTRAINT IN YOUR NECK SO AS YOU ARE SETTING UP KEEP YOUR FREE WEIGHTS DOWN BY YOUR SIDE AND YOU ARE GOING TO COME FROM A SEATED POSITION TO ROLL YOURSELF ALL THE WAY DOWN UNTIL YOU FEEL YOUR HEAD AND YOUR SHOULDERS TOUCH THE BALL
GUPTKqn6eWs_11 0 WE ARE GOING TO REPEAT BETWEEN EIGHT AND FIFTEEN REPS YOU ARE EXHALING AS YOU PUSH UP AND INHALE AS YOU LOWER DOWN SO THINGS TO REALLY THINK ABOUT IS TO KEEP YOUR WRIST STRAIGHT TRY NOT TO LET THEM COCK TRY NOT TO LET YOUR ELBOWS DROP DOWN BELOW THE SHOULDERS KEEP THEM IN LINE WITH THE SHOULDERS AS YOU PUSH UP
GUPTKqn6eWs_12 0 YOUR BACK NEEDS TO BE REALLY STABLE KEEP THE ABS LOCKED IN EXHALE AND INHALE
GUPTKqn6eWs_13 0 SO A COUPLE OF KEY POINTERS TO REMEMBER IS YOU'VE GOT YOUR NINETY DEGREE ANGLES WITH YOUR LOWER BODY YOUR SHOULDERS AND YOUR HEAD NEED TO STAY ON THE BALL
GUPTKqn6eWs_14 0 KEEP THAT NINETY DEGREE ANGLE WITH YOUR SHOULDERS ELBOWS AND WRISTS
GUPTKqn6eWs_15 0 YOU CAN ALSO OPEN THIS UP INTO A FLY AND DO YOUR FLY WORK FOR WORKING ALL THOSE MUSCLES ACROSS YOUR CHEST KEEP THOSE ABS ENGAGED AND YOU'LL BE READY TO GO
GUPTKqn6eWs_16 0 SO THAT IS HOW YOU DO YOUR CHEST PRESS IN A BRIDGE POSITION
gxWY84AE9Qw_1 0 HI I'M MARK SULLIVAN FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
gxWY84AE9Qw_2 0 TODAY WE ARE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO INSTALL A CEILING FAN IN YOUR HOME
gxWY84AE9Qw_3 0 ALSO WHERE THE LIGHT MOUNTING KIT MOUNTS ON TO THE BOTTOM HOUSING THERE IS A NUT AND A WASHER THAT YOU NEED TO PUT ON THERE AND TIGHTEN THAT UP
gxWY84AE9Qw_4 0 THAT IS JUST TO SECURE YOUR LIGHT HOUSING KIT
gxWY84AE9Qw_5 0 NOW WE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TIGHTEN THAT UP WITH SOME PLIERS
gxWY84AE9Qw_7 0 THIS IS JUST A BALLAST AND HERE IS YOUR TWO WIRES
gxWY84AE9Qw_8 0 NOW WE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND HOOK THESE UP
gxWY84AE9Qw_9 0 THE BLACK TO THE BLUE WIRE NUTS AGAIN PLACED ON
gxWY84AE9Qw_10 0 SCREW THE WIRE NUTS ON WHILE YOU ARE HOLDING THE WIRES TIGHTLY
gxWY84AE9Qw_11 0 THEN WHITE TO THE WHITE
gxWY84AE9Qw_12 0 SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS FINE
gxWY84AE9Qw_13 0 NOW THAT WE HAVE THAT PUT TOGETHER WE WOULD GENTLY TUCK THESE WIRES OUT OF THE WAY AND PUSH THE WIRE INTO THE HOUSING GENTLY
gxWY84AE9Qw_14 0 DON'T DISCONNECT ANYTHING
gxWY84AE9Qw_15 0 THEN WHEN IT ALL LOOKS GOOD STUDY IT AND SEE IF THERE IS ANY WIRES TOUCHING ANYTHING
gxWY84AE9Qw_16 0 IF YOU THINK IF ANYTHING IS GOING TO RUB OFF OR THAT ALL LOOKS PRETTY GOOD RIGHT THERE
gxWY84AE9Qw_17 0 SO NOW WE ARE GOING TO HOOK UP THIS CONNECTOR
gxWY84AE9Qw_18 0 WE WOULD PUT THE TWO SCREWS IN THREE SCREWS AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE OUR LIGHT KIT ATTACHED TO THE HOUSING AND HOOKED ON TO THE CEILING FAN
hdrDeZAi-7U_1 0 ANOTHER OPENING THAT YOU CAN USE IS ONE THAT CLASSICALLY YOU WOULD FIND ON A LEATHER MOTORCYCLE JACKET
hdrDeZAi-7U_2 0 IT'S CALLED THE BIKER
hdrDeZAi-7U_3 0 THIS ONE THAT I HAVE DRAWN IS A DOUBLE BREASTED WITH SNAPS
hdrDeZAi-7U_4 0 WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THERE'S SNAP I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE SILVER BUT I'M PUTTING THEM IN GREEN
hdrDeZAi-7U_5 0 THE COLLAR SNAPS DOWNS AND IT'S HELD DOWN BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO RIDE ON A MOTORCYCLE THERE'S GOING TO BE WIND AND YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR COLLAR FLAPPING
hdrDeZAi-7U_6 0 I GUESS THAT'S WHERE THAT COMES IN THAT NOW IS MORE OF A DESIGN STYLE AS OPPOSED TO A UTILITY FEATURE
hdrDeZAi-7U_7 0 THE BIKER PART THE DOUBLE BREASTED BIKER PART OF IT IN ORDER TO HAVE IT BE LABELED THIS THERE'S A ZIPPER
hdrDeZAi-7U_8 0 THAT LIKE YOU HAVE A CLASSIC TRENCH COAT THAT FOLDS OVER AND HOLDS ITSELF TOGETHER ON THE SIDE NOT IN THE CENTER
hdrDeZAi-7U_9 0 WITH A BIKER JACKET YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A ZIPPER THAT DOES THE SAME THING AS THE BUTTONS DO ON YOUR TRENCH COAT AND IT'S GOING TO BE RIGHT THERE
hG33EmJ7X-w_2 0 I'M KAY AND WE ARE FILMING FOR EXPERTVILLAGE.COM HERE AT CARTER'S APPLIANCE IN FONTANA CALIFORNIA
hG33EmJ7X-w_3 0 HERE ARE SOME OF THE STORAGE COMPARTMENTS IN A REFRIGERATOR FIRST OF ALL YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE FREEZER
hG33EmJ7X-w_4 0 GENERALLY IN THE FREEZER YOUR HAVE SHELVES OR BINS
hG33EmJ7X-w_5 0 SOME WILL BE REMOVABLE SOME WILL BE STATIONARY
hG33EmJ7X-w_6 0 ON OCCASION YOU WILL HAVE AN ICE MAKER IN PLACE AS WELL
hG33EmJ7X-w_7 0 ON THIS PARTICULAR MODEL THE ICE MAKER IS COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT AND IS NOT LOCATED IN THE FREEZER COMPARTMENT
hG33EmJ7X-w_8 0 SECOND THING YOU WILL NEED TO KNOW IS THE AREA OF THE STORAGE OF YOUR FRESH FOOD SECTION
hG33EmJ7X-w_9 0 THIS IS WHERE YOUR PRODUCE AND MILK IS GOING TO BE STORED
hG33EmJ7X-w_10 0 ON THIS PARTICULAR MODEL IT HAS WHAT WE CALL A BEVERAGE CHILLER WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO STORE MILK JUICE OR OTHER ITEMS THAT YOU LIKE AT A LOWER TEMPERATURE THAN WHAT IS IN THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE OF THE FRESH FOOD SECTION BECAUSE THERE IS AN ACCESS PORT FOR THE CHILLER
hG33EmJ7X-w_11 0 YOU ALSO HAVE A DELI DRAWER IN THIS MODEL WHICH ALLOWS OR ACCOMMODATES LARGE BULKY ITEMS FOR CHILLING
HeBySQSIl5k_1 0 IN THIS SERES WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO JUGGLE THREE BALLS
HeBySQSIl5k_2 0 WE STARTED WITH JUST A SINGLE BALL
HeBySQSIl5k_3 0 LEARNING THE TIMING AND THE HEIGHT PATTERN THAT WE NEED TO MAKE
HeBySQSIl5k_4 0 TO THROW A THREE BALL PATTERN
HeBySQSIl5k_5 0 SO IN THIS THE THROWS GO FROM YOUR HAND TO CORNER OF A BOX
HeBySQSIl5k_6 0 IMMEDIATELY OVER YOUR OTHER HAND
HeBySQSIl5k_7 0 YOU CATCH ON THE OUTSIDE BRING IT BACK TO THE BOX AND AGAIN
HeBySQSIl5k_8 0 THEN WE ADDED THE SECOND BALL AND TRIED THE SAME THING
HeBySQSIl5k_9 0 IN THIS THE PATTERN IS THROW THROW CATCH CATCH
HeBySQSIl5k_10 0 YOUR WANT TO TRY AND KEEP IT RIGHT ON RHYTHM
HeBySQSIl5k_11 0 THROW THROW CATCH CATCH
HeBySQSIl5k_12 0 WE PRACTICED DOING THIS BOTH WAYS AND CLEANING THIS UP A LOT
HeBySQSIl5k_13 0 WE ADD THE THIRD BALL AND THE PATTERN HERE WILL JUST BE SOLID THROWS
HeBySQSIl5k_14 0 IT SHOULD BE THROW THROW THROW THROW
HeBySQSIl5k_15 0 THEY SHOULD TRY AND REALLY BE CLOSE TO THE SAME RHYTHM
HeBySQSIl5k_16 0 SO THAT YOU MAKE THROWS ON BEAT EVERY TIME
HeBySQSIl5k_17 0 THROW THROW THROW THROW AND THIS IS OUR THREE BALL CASCADE PATTERN
HeBySQSIl5k_18 0 SO IN THE FIRST TRICKS WE WENT OVER
HeBySQSIl5k_19 0 IT'S OVER THE TOP
HeBySQSIl5k_20 0 LIKE THIS TAKING ONE THROW FROM THE OUTSIDE AND THROWING IT OVER
HeBySQSIl5k_21 0 DOING THAT WITH BOTH HANDS
HeBySQSIl5k_22 0 GOING INTO WHAT'S CALLED JUGGLERS TENNIS
HeBySQSIl5k_23 0 LIKE THIS WHERE ONE BALL IS CONTINUOUSLY CROSSING OVER THE TOP OF THE OTHERS
HeBySQSIl5k_24 0 WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE REVERSE CASCADE
HeBySQSIl5k_25 0 WHERE EVERY BALL IS CROSSING OVER THE BALL IN FRONT OF IT
HeBySQSIl5k_26 0 WE ALSO WENT OVER MILL'S MESS
HeBySQSIl5k_27 0 WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS JUGGLING TRICKS AND ONE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE TRY TO LEARN EARLY
HeBySQSIl5k_28 0 WHICH LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
HeBySQSIl5k_29 0 NEXT WE'LL BE MOVING ON TO SOME MORE ADVANCED BALL TRICKS
GyadXiKJfLU_1 0 OKAY NOW THIS METHOD OF DOING A KNOB WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO FIRST IS TAKE OUR SCORING TOOL GET IT WET AND SCORE UP THE CENTER WHERE YOUR KNOB IS GOING TO GO
GyadXiKJfLU_2 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S NICE AND GOOPY BECAUSE THIS LID HAS ALREADY REACHED THE LEATHER HARD STAGE
GyadXiKJfLU_3 0 BUT WE'RE GOING TO THROW A FRESH CLAY KNOB ONTO IT
GyadXiKJfLU_4 0 I JUST PINCHED A SMALL AMOUNT OF CLAY OFF OF MY CLAY AND ROLLED IT INTO A BALL AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE TO MAKE THE KNOB
GyadXiKJfLU_5 0 SO THAT'S WHY WE LEFT A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA THICKNESS HERE ON THIS LID
GyadXiKJfLU_6 0 BECAUSE WE'RE THROWING DIRECTLY DOWN ONTO IT
GyadXiKJfLU_7 0 YOU'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING SOME PRESSURE ON THERE
GyadXiKJfLU_8 0 YOU DO HAVE TO SCORE IT UP AND GET IT PRETTY WET
GyadXiKJfLU_9 0 AND IF IT'S TOO THIN YOU'RE JUST GOING TO PUSH STRAIGHT THROUGH THERE AND THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT
GyadXiKJfLU_10 0 SO YOU ALSO WANT TO SCORE YOUR CLAY BALL REALLY WELL
GyadXiKJfLU_11 0 THIS CONNECTION NEEDS TO BE VERY SECURE
GyadXiKJfLU_12 0 IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME TO DRY
GyadXiKJfLU_13 0 TO GET TO THE SAME DRYNESS
GyadXiKJfLU_14 0 YOU JUST WANT TO PUS THAT DIRECTLY ON THERE AND SQUEEZE IT
GyadXiKJfLU_15 0 NOW BEFORE YOU ADD ANY WATER YOU JUST WANT TO PUSH DOWN AND SQUEEZE TOWARDS THE CENTER OF THIS KNOB SO THAT IT'S ON THERE
GyadXiKJfLU_16 0 AND ONCE YOU'VE GOT THAT CLAY SECURELY IN PLACE YOU'RE READY TO DO THE ACTUAL THROWING OF THE KNOB WHICH IS WHAT WE'LL DO NEXT
H_1n5YzvejY_1 0 HI I'M DAN MCLELLEN WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
H_1n5YzvejY_2 0 NOW WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO DRESS UP THE DUCK TO MAKE IT JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE PRESENTABLE MAKE IT A LITTLE FUN
H_1n5YzvejY_3 0 WERE GOING TO ADD A FACE IN AND A HEART ON TO THE DUCK AND IT WILL GIVE IT JUST A LOT MORE LIFE
H_1n5YzvejY_4 0 I'M GOING TO START OFF BY USING A BLUE SHARPIE HERE TO DRAW A COUPLE OF LITTLE EYES ON
H_1n5YzvejY_5 0 I'M GOING TO DO SOME SIMPLE BASIC CIRCLES HERE AND THEN I'M GOING TO PULL OUT MY BLACK SHARPIE AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS ACTUALLY GIVE THE PUPILS IN THE EYES AND THAT GIVES A LITTLE MORE REALITY TO IT
H_1n5YzvejY_6 0 SO I'M GIVE A LITTLE BLACK CIRCLES INSIDE THE BLUE CIRCLES DRAW ON SOME EYEBROWS AND SOME EYELASHES AND A COUPLE LITTLE MARKS ON THE BEAK THERE AND THAT CREATES THE FACE OF THE DUCK RIGHT THERE
H_1n5YzvejY_7 0 BUT I'M NOT GOING TO STOP HERE PERHAPS I'M GIVING THIS TO A LITTLE GIRL AND I HAVE FOUND THAT IF YOU JUST ADD A SIMPLE HEART TO ALMOST ANY CREATION YOU DRESS IT UP A LOT
H_1n5YzvejY_8 0 SO ONCE AGAIN I'M GOING TO BLOW UP A HEART I'M GOING TO USE A PINK BALLOON THIS TIME ONCE AGAIN I'M NOT BLOWING IT UP ALL THE WAY I'M LEAVING A LITTLE BIT OF AIR THERE I'M GOING TO LET A LITTLE BIT OF AIR OUT OF THE TOP THERE SO THAT I CAN TIE IT GIVE ME SOME AREA TO WORK WITH
H_1n5YzvejY_9 0 FOLD THE BALLOON IN THIRDS AND DO MY BEAR HUG TAKE A HALF INCH ON BOTH ENDS OF THE BALLOON HERE AND CONNECT THEM FLIP IT UP HOLD THE BALLOON AT TEN AND TWO PUT MY HANDS IN REVERSE DIRECTION FOLD DOWN SQUEEZE AND I'VE GOT A HEART
H_1n5YzvejY_10 0 AND NOW I'M GOING TO TAKE THE TAIL AND I'M GOING TO CONNECT IT INTO THE SEGMENT WHERE THE TWO HALF INCHES CONNECT IN THE HEART AND NOW THE DUCK IS CONNECTED TO THE HEART AND IT JUST LOOKS OH SO MUCH MORE CUTE
H_1n5YzvejY_11 0 WELL THAT'S IT THAT'S A COMPLEX DUCK INSIDE A HEART
GL4hOJF6WSQ_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS KAREN LOCASALE AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT CRAFTING WITH GOURDS
GL4hOJF6WSQ_2 0 PUTTING YOUR DESIGNS ON THE GOURD THIS IS THE FUN PART
GL4hOJF6WSQ_3 0 YOU GET TO DECIDE WHAT IT IS YOU WANT YOUR GOURD TO HAVE ON IT AND GET CREATIVE
GL4hOJF6WSQ_4 0 LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN DO FOR THIS
GL4hOJF6WSQ_5 0 RUBBER STAMPS WORK WELL YOU CAN ACTUALLY STAMP ON TO PAPER AND THEN FROM THERE WE CAN TRANSFER IT ON TO THE GOURD USING CARBON PAPER
GL4hOJF6WSQ_6 0 YOU CAN GET LOTS OF DIFFERENT DESIGN PATTERNS FROM DIFFERENT BOOKS
GL4hOJF6WSQ_7 0 THIS IS A SCROLL SAW PATTERN BOOK THAT HAS LOTS OF GOOD PATTERNS IN IT
GL4hOJF6WSQ_8 0 YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR FAIRLY SIMPLE PATTERNS TO START OUT WITH
GL4hOJF6WSQ_9 0 YOU CAN ALWAYS GO BACK IN AND ADD THE DETAILS
GL4hOJF6WSQ_10 0 THERE'S LOTS OF BOOKS OUT ON THE MARKET IT'S DEPENDING ON I LIKE TO DO SOUTHWEST SO I HAVE LOTS OF SOUTHWEST AND INDIAN DESIGN BOOKS BUT THERE'S ALSO CELTIC AND YOU KNOW ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS CHECK OUT YOUR BOOK STORE OR LIBRARY E-BAY FOR DIFFERENT DESIGN BOOKS
gFWvrtf209A_1 0 HARMONIE KRIEGER SO LIKE I WAS TALKING ABOUT WITH THE BATH & BODY WORKS AND THE BODY CREAM AND THE LOTION THIS IS THE BODY SPRAY
gFWvrtf209A_2 0 THIS IS ALSO PEAR BLOSSOM CAUSE IT'S MY FAVORITE FLAVOR AND THIS IS SO GREAT BECAUSE THIS I TAKE EVERYWHERE WITH ME
gFWvrtf209A_3 0 SO NOT ONLY CAN YOU SPRAY YOUR BODY YOU CAN SPRAY THE ROOM YOU CAN SPRAY YOUR CAR YOU CAN SPRAY ANYTHING YOU WANT
gFWvrtf209A_4 0 THIS ALSO COMES IN A LITTLE TRAVEL SIZE SO YOU CAN PUT IT IN YOUR PURSE
gFWvrtf209A_5 0 NOW IF YOU DON'T CARRY PERFUME ON YOU WHICH I RECOMMEND TO CARRY A LITTLE TUBE IN YOUR PURSE YOU CAN ALWAYS CARRY A LITTLE BODY SPLASH BECAUSE IT'S A VERY NATURAL SCENT
gFWvrtf209A_6 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE GOING INTO A MEETING OR YOU'RE GOING INTO YOUR OFFICE YOU CAN ALWAYS SPRITZ YOURSELF REALLY QUICKLY WITH A BODY SPRAY
gFWvrtf209A_7 0 SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE CREAMS AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE PERFUME GET THE BODY SPLASH
gFWvrtf209A_8 0 THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE THING I RECOMMEND AS FAR AS PRODUCTS ON THE GO FOR THE WOMAN THAT'S VERY BUSY AND ONLY HAS TIME FOR ONE SPRITZ
gFWvrtf209A_9 0 SO THIS IS A GREAT FRESHEN-UPPER
gFWvrtf209A_10 0 OKAY WHEN YOU GO INTO THE BATHROOM AT HOTELS YOU ALWAYS SEE THOSE LITTLE SPRAYS AND YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO USE SOMEBODY ELSE'S SPRAY
gFWvrtf209A_11 0 SO ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A LITTLE TRAVEL SIZE OF THE PEAR BLOSSOM
gFWvrtf209A_12 0 NOW THE GREAT THING ABOUT BATH & BODY WORKS IS THEY COME IN THREES SO YOU CAN GET AS MANY FLAVORS AS YOU WANT AND SMELL AS MANY SCENTS AS YOU WANT UNTIL YOU FIND THE SCENT THAT'S GOOD FOR YOU
G_u8rvAVSCk_1 0 MY NAME IS SCOTT MCKAY AND TODAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO GET PAINTBALL PAINT OFF OF YOUR VEHICLE
G_u8rvAVSCk_2 0 HOPEFULLY IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU SHOT IT ON PURPOSE BUT MORE LIKELY IT'S BEEN VANDALIZED AND THIS HAPPENED
G_u8rvAVSCk_3 0 HOPEFULLY THOSE OF YOU OUT THERE THAT DO OWN PAINTBALL MARKERS DON'T RUN AROUND ON THE STREETS SHOOTING OTHER PEOPLE'S CARS CAUSE THAT WILL LAND YOU IN JAIL
G_u8rvAVSCk_4 0 AND GIVE A BAD NAME TO THE HOBBY
G_u8rvAVSCk_5 0 WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS TWO KINDS OF PAINT
G_u8rvAVSCk_6 0 THIS IS YOUR MORE GENERIC PAINT IT'S USUALLY A VEGETABLE BASE OIL
G_u8rvAVSCk_7 0 THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A HIGHER END PAINT THAT'S USUALLY A WATER BASED A LOT THICKER THE EASE OF GETTING IT OFF IS GOING TO REALLY DEPEND ON HOW LONG IT'S BEEN ON THERE
G_u8rvAVSCk_8 0 I'VE GOT SOME SIMPLE TOOLS HERE TODAY PALMOLIVE WARM WATER A TERRY CLOTH TOWEL AND A MISTER CLEAN MAGIC ERASER
G_u8rvAVSCk_9 0 THOSE SHOULD GET OUT JUST ABOUT ANYTHING OFF
G_u8rvAVSCk_10 0 WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT LATER
G_u8rvAVSCk_11 0 SOME OTHER STUFF THAT YOU CAN DO
G_u8rvAVSCk_12 0 FIRST THING OBVIOUSLY TO PICK THE HEAVY STUFF OFF
G_u8rvAVSCk_13 0 GET IT AS CLEAN AS YOU CAN
G_u8rvAVSCk_14 0 MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO KEEP YOUR SPONGE OR MAGIC ERASER CLEAN THE WHOLE TIME YOU ARE DOING IT SO AS NOT TO SPREAD IT INTO BIGGER AREAS
G_u8rvAVSCk_15 0 SOME OF THOSE ONES THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO GET OFF YOU MIGHT EVEN TRY GOING TO A CAR WASH AND USING THE HIGH PRESSURE GUN ON
G_u8rvAVSCk_16 0 YOU MIGHT KIND OF GET INTO IT A LITTLE BIT HEAVIER
G_u8rvAVSCk_17 0 WIPE IT ALL DOWN MAKE SURE THERE'S NO RESIDUAL OIL AROUND
G_u8rvAVSCk_18 0 TAKE YOUR TERRY CLOTH TOWEL WIPE IT CLEAN
G_u8rvAVSCk_19 0 THIS WORKS GREAT LIKE I SAID PLUS IF YOU PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD USE WD FORTY IT'S A PETROLEUM BASE IT WILL USUALLY CLEAN UP AND I'VE ALSO BEEN TOLD IT WILL CLEAN UP IF YOUR CAR GETS HIT WITH SPRAY PAINT
G_u8rvAVSCk_20 0 IT WILL CLEAN THE PAINT OFF THE CAR IF YOU CATCH IT FAIRLY SOON
G_u8rvAVSCk_21 0 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
HE3V48KjQKg_1 0 HERE AGAIN WE HAVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHAT I'VE DONE WHEN I JUST LET MY HAND DRAW FREE
HE3V48KjQKg_2 0 WHEN I SHUT MY EYES AND DESIGNED
HE3V48KjQKg_3 0 IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU THAT THE DESIGNING POSSIBILITIES FOR SWIM SUITS ARE ENDLESS
HE3V48KjQKg_4 0 THESE LINES ARE NOTHING LIKE ANY OF THE OTHER ONES I'VE SHOWN YOU BUT THEY'RE NOTHING LIKE ANYTHING I'LL CREATE NEXT
HE3V48KjQKg_5 0 JUST SIT DOWN I BEG OF YOU TO SIT DOWN
HE3V48KjQKg_6 0 GIVE YOURSELF AN HOUR BLOCK AN HOUR OF TIME FIRST
HE3V48KjQKg_7 0 NOT MUCH MORE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HOW MUCH YOU DO JUST BLOCK AN HOUR OF TIME SIT DOWN AND CHALLENGE YOURSELF TO CREATE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF STYLES BASED OFF OF ONE SILHOUETTE
HE3V48KjQKg_8 0 DO THE EASIEST THING STARTING OUT IS THE ONE PIECE BATHING SUIT
HE3V48KjQKg_9 0 SEE HOW MANY DIFFERENT IDEAS YOU CAN CREATE FREE FLOWING JUST LET IT GO
HE3V48KjQKg_10 0 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT AND YOU WILL COME UP WITH THE MOST AMAZING THINGS WHEN YOU JUST LET YOURSELF GO
HE3V48KjQKg_11 0 THIS ONE OBVIOUSLY I'M PROBABLY NOT GOING TO REPRODUCE UPSIDE DOWN AS WELL BUT YOU GET THE POINT
HE3V48KjQKg_12 0 IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU REPRODUCE THIS EXACT SAME THING IT'S ALL BASED ON WHAT YOU FEEL AT THE MOMENT AND WHERE YOU WANT THE LINES TO GO ON THE BODY
HE3V48KjQKg_13 0 SO I'M JUST GOING TO STOP RIGHT THERE AND LET YOU TAKE IT FROM THERE
Gr4RVfcIAfY_1 0 HI I'M MARK EMILEY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
Gr4RVfcIAfY_2 0 IN THIS NEXT SEGMENT WE'LL BE DISCUSSING SOME OF SANITIZERS YOU CAN USE TO START TO KILL THE MICROBES ON YOUR EQUIPMENT
Gr4RVfcIAfY_3 0 NEXT I'M GOING TO COVER TWO NON RINSE SANITIZERS AND CLEANSERS
Gr4RVfcIAfY_4 0 FIRST WE HAVE ONE STEP WHICH WILL HELP BREAK UP BIO MATTER AND ALSO SANITIZE WERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO RINSE AND YOU CAN USE THAT AT THE RATE OF ONE TABLESPOON PER GALLON
Gr4RVfcIAfY_5 0 YOU ALSO FIVE STAR WHICH YOU CAN USE AT A RATE OF ONE OZ PER FIVE GALLONS AND THIS WILL HELP SANITIZE YOUR EQUIPMENT
Gr4RVfcIAfY_6 0 FINALLY WE HAVE IODA FOUR YOU CAN USE THIS AT A RATE OF ONE TABLESPOON FOR FIVE GALLONS
Gr4RVfcIAfY_7 0 IT IS A VERY EFFECTIVE AND CHEAP SANITIZER
Gr4RVfcIAfY_8 0 AT THIS POINT IN THE BREWING PROCESS YOU NEED TO CLEAN ALL OF YOUR EQUIPMENT BUT IN PARTICULAR YOU NEED TO SANITIZE WHICH IS THE EXTRA LENGTH OF CLEANING YOUR PRIMARY FERMENTER AND IF YOU'VE ACTUALLY GONE WITH THE GLASS CARBROID YOU NEED TO SANITIZE YOUR FILTER AS WELL YOUR AIR LOCK YOUR RUBBER STOPPERS AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT WILL BE TOUCHING THE BEER AFTER IT HAS GONE COLD
Gr4RVfcIAfY_9 0 LATER IN THE BREWING PROCESS YOU'LL NEED TO SANITIZE ALL YOUR RACKING EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS YOUR BOTTLES YOUR BOTTLING BUCKET AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT WILL BE TOUCHING THE BEER AFTER ITS COLD
Gr4RVfcIAfY_10 0 WHAT EVER YOU CHOOSE FOR YOUR CLEANSER AND SANITIZER I RECOMMEND FILLING A BUCKET WITH IT SO YOU CAN DIP ALL OF YOUR EQUIPMENT IN THERE AS NEEDED
GgI-2wEMSE8_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO USE AT THIS STYLE I LIKE TO USE A VARIETY OF PAPERS BUT TO START OUT ONE OF THE EASIEST AND BEST WAYS TO WORK IS ON A PAPER THAT HAS A GRID ALREADY
GgI-2wEMSE8_3 0 BECAUSE WE FIT THE LETTERS IN BETWEEN GUIDELINES THE GRID ALREADY ESTABLISHES PARALLEL LINES SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THE MARKS WITHOUT HAVING TO MEASURE
GgI-2wEMSE8_4 0 NOW FOR ME THAT'S A BIG PLUS AND I HOPE IT WILL BE A BIG PLUS FOR YOU
GgI-2wEMSE8_5 0 I THINK GRID PAPER ENABLES YOU TO SET UP YOUR SHEET FOR WRITING IN A WAY THAT IS VERY QUICK AND EFFICIENT AND FOR THAT REASON I THINK YOU PRACTICE MORE
GgI-2wEMSE8_6 0 SO I RECOMMEND THE PLAIN THE GRIDDED PAPER ALTHOUGH YOU CAN USE PLAIN PAPER TOO
GgI-2wEMSE8_7 0 PLAIN PAPER NECESSITATES MEASUREMENTS SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE FITTING YOUR LETTERS INTO GRID WHICH WE'LL DISCUSS SHORTLY YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MARK BOTH SIDES OF THE PAGE AND THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT BECAUSE THIS WON'T LINE UP
GgI-2wEMSE8_8 0 BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU THE IDEA AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO CONNECT THE DOTS WHICH WE'RE DOING IN A SORT OF HAP HAZARD FASHION AND ESTABLISH GRID THAT WAY
ghh5IYcGAlY_1 0 MY NAME IS ABBY JONES AND I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PROCESS OF MOVING INTO A NEW APARTMENT
ghh5IYcGAlY_2 0 AND RIGHT NOW I'M IN THE KITCHEN AND I AM TALKING ABOUT HOW TO ORGANIZE YOUR KITCHEN IN AN EFFICIENT AND FUNCTIONAL WAY
ghh5IYcGAlY_3 0 AND I'M SPECIFICALLY IN MY PANTRY AND TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE GOOD TO PUT IN A PANTRY AND WHERE TO PUT THEM IN THE PANTRY
ghh5IYcGAlY_4 0 SO SOMETHING THAT I HAVE A LOT OF ARE DISHTOWELS AND NAPKINS AND DISHRAGS AND LINENS FOR KITCHEN USE
ghh5IYcGAlY_5 0 SO I DON'T I ONLY HAVE TWO DRAWERS IN MY KITCHEN OUTSIDE IN THE KITCHEN AND THERE ARE NO DRAWERS IN THE PANTRY THERE ARE ONLY THESE SHELVES
ghh5IYcGAlY_6 0 SO I'VE CHOSEN TO PUT MY DISH TOWELS IN THESE BASKETS MY LINENS
ghh5IYcGAlY_7 0 IN THEN THIS BASKET I'M PUTTING NAPKINS EXTRA NAPKINS AND DISH TOWELS
ghh5IYcGAlY_8 0 SO THESE BASKETS KEEP THEM CONTAINED THEY KEEP THEM CLEAN BECAUSE I CAN TAKE THESE LINERS OUT AND WASH THEM TOO
ghh5IYcGAlY_9 0 AND THEY'RE EASILY ACCESSIBLE
ghh5IYcGAlY_10 0 SO THE OTHER THING THAT I'M DOING WITH MY NAPKINS IS I HAVE THIS KIND OF WOODEN TROUGH
ghh5IYcGAlY_11 0 SO THESE ARE THE NAPKINS THAT I USE THE MOST OFTEN THAT I LIKE USING MORE THAN THE EXTRA ONES THAT I HAVE IN THE BASKET
ghh5IYcGAlY_12 0 AND I'M KEEPING THESE OUT ACTUALLY IN THE KITCHEN FOR DECORATIVE PURPOSES AND ALSO JUST BECAUSE I USE THEM A LOT
ghh5IYcGAlY_13 0 AND THEN I ALSO OVER HERE HAVE MY TABLE CLOTHS WHICH I DON'T USE ALL THAT MUCH AND A COUPLE OF EXTRA POT HOLDERS THAT I'M NOT USING SO I'M KEEPING THOSE NEARBY MY LINENS AS WELL
GAzwixKTOBc_1 0 MIKE LAIS HI I'M MIKE LAIS
GAzwixKTOBc_2 0 AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE THIS IS PLAYING PIANO 7TH CHORDS
GAzwixKTOBc_3 0 SO NOW WE HAVE THE DOMINANT CHORD
GAzwixKTOBc_4 0 LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER INVERSIONS OF IT THAT WE CAN DO
GAzwixKTOBc_5 0 FOR EXAMPLE THE FIRST INVERSION WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HERE IS WHERE WE SPELL OUT FROM THE 3RD OF THE CHORD AS OPPOSED TO THE ROOT OF THE CHORD
GAzwixKTOBc_6 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO GO HERE
GAzwixKTOBc_7 0 WE'LL TAKE OUR C DOMINANT SEVEN AGAIN WHICH IS ONE THREE FIVE FLAT SEVEN AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THE FIRST INVERSION OF THIS WHICH WE'RE BASICALLY STARTING OFF ON THE ROOT AND JUST TAKING OR WE'RE STARTING OFF ON THE THIRD TAKING THE ROOT BRINGING THAT UP TO THE OCTAVE
GAzwixKTOBc_9 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO GO THE FIRST INVERSION IS SPELLED THREE FIVE FLAT SEVEN ONE
GAzwixKTOBc_10 0 JUST LIKE THAT
GAzwixKTOBc_11 0 THAT'S GOING TO BE YOUR FIRST INVERSION OF A DOMINANT 7TH CHORD
glxFg9g3sAI_1 0 ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS YOU WANT TO DO ONCE YOUR CHILD STARTS LEARNING THE ALPHABET AND THE LETTER SOUNDS IS MAKE A WORD NOTEBOOK AND THIS IS GOING TO BE THE CRUCIAL CENTER OF THEIR EDUCATION FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS POSSIBLY
glxFg9g3sAI_2 0 NOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO ALL OF THEIR HOME SCHOOLING IN ONE NOTEBOOK OR ONE FOR READING AND WRITING AND ONE FOR MATH
glxFg9g3sAI_3 0 IN THE OLDEN DAYS THAT'S ALL STUDENTS REALLY HAD WAS ONE NOTEBOOK AND A PENCIL AND A BLACK BOARD AND THEY LEARNED OFTEN MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN CHILDREN LEARN TODAY BUT IF YOU WANT TO WORK WITH THE FOLDERS AND WORKSHEETS IT'S AS ADVANCED AS COMPLEX AS YOU WANT TO MAKE IT OR AS SIMPLE AS YOU WANT TO MAKE IT
glxFg9g3sAI_4 0 THEY WILL LEARN BECAUSE IT IS ONE ON ONE AND YOU ARE THE TEACHER
glxFg9g3sAI_5 0 BUT A WORD NOTEBOOK IS A GREAT PLACE TO START AFTER THEY LEARN THE ALPHABET AND LETTER SOUNDS
glxFg9g3sAI_6 0 WHAT WE DO BASICALLY IS EACH PAGE HAS A DIFFERENT TYPE OF WORD
glxFg9g3sAI_7 0 NOW IN THE BEGINNING WE'RE ONLY GOING TO DO SIMPLE SOUNDING OUT WORDS CONSONANT VOWEL CONSONANT WITH VERY NATURAL SHORT VOWELS LIKE CAT AND CAN AND PIN AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO WE WILL START OUT AND FILL THE PAGES WITH THESE
glxFg9g3sAI_8 0 WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS I LIKE TO SWITCH UP THE DIFFERENT VOWELS DON'T ALWAYS DO LETTERS WITH A IN THE MIDDLE FOR TOO LONG AND FOR PAGES AND PAGES IN THE BEGINNING WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE DOING THESE SIMPLE WORDS BUT THEN WHEN WE GET EACH TIME WE LEARN A NEW RULE WE'LL PUT THE RULE AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE AND THEN FILL THAT PAGE WITH WORDS THAT FOLLOW THAT RULE AND THAT'S HOW WE WILL KEEP OUR WORD NOTEBOOK
h5AupnBwicM_1 0 HI TODAY WE ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT PINK LUSTER AND WHAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE SHELVES IN MY SHOP AT SHEA ANTIQUES WE HAVE PINK LUSTER IN A COUPLE OF SHELVES THAT WE ARE GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY
h5AupnBwicM_2 0 SO ONE THING THAT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT FIRST WHEN YOU ARE COLLECTING THIS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AND YOU SAY NINETEEN CENTURY
h5AupnBwicM_3 0 WHAT I MEAN BY NINETEEN CENTURY IS THE 1800S AND PEOPLE USUALLY GET CONFUSED THAT YOU NEED TO REMEMBER THAT WHEN TALK ABOUT EIGHTEEN CENTURY YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT WHERE MADE IN 1700S
h5AupnBwicM_4 0 SO IN REFERENCE IS LIKE WE ARE IN THE 21ST CENTURY SO WE KNOW WE ARE IN 2007
h5AupnBwicM_5 0 SO JUST REMEMBER YOU GO BACK A 100 YEARS WHEN YOU ARE TALKING IN CENTURIES
h5AupnBwicM_6 0 SO NOW THAT WE GOT THAT CLEARED UP WE ARE TALKING TODAY ABOUT NINETEEN CENTURY PINK LUSTER

GLSEPbGzL5U_2 0 MY NAME IS SHERYL WITH EXPERTVILLAGE.COM AND TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MOUNTING A POSTER OR A PHOTO OF ANY SIZE
GLSEPbGzL5U_3 0 AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE FIRST DOING THIS IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO JUST USE A SMALL PHOTO
GLSEPbGzL5U_4 0 THE ONE I'M USING IS ABOUT A 5X7 INCH PHOTO
GLSEPbGzL5U_5 0 YOU CAN EVEN PRACTICE WITH A LITTLE 4X6 INCH JUST TO GET THE HANG OF THIS
GLSEPbGzL5U_6 0 WE HAD TWO PIECES OF BROWN PAPER
GLSEPbGzL5U_7 0 ONE IS OUTSIDE I SPRAYED GLUE ON THE BACKSIDE OF THIS PIECE OF PAPER
GLSEPbGzL5U_8 0 IT NOW HAS GLUE ON IT
GLSEPbGzL5U_9 0 THAT PIECE OF PAPER THE ONE THAT IS OUTSIDE NEEDS TO BE THROWN AWAY
GLSEPbGzL5U_10 0 I HAVE JUST ROLLED THIS ONE
GLSEPbGzL5U_11 0 IT HAS NO GLUE ON IT AND I HAVE JUST ROLLED IT OUT
GLSEPbGzL5U_12 0 YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE THIS PIECE OF PAPER AGAIN
GLSEPbGzL5U_13 0 IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY GLUE ON IT
GLSEPbGzL5U_14 0 THE OTHER THING ABOUT THIS IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MATCHING THIS UP PERFECTLY
GLSEPbGzL5U_15 0 YOU JUST NEED TO GET IT ON THE FOAM CORE AND IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO MATCH UP BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND CUT IT LATER ON
GC3uGpmvBS0_1 0 HI THIS IS YOLANDA VANVEEN FROM VANVEEN BULBS
GC3uGpmvBS0_2 0 AND NEXT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO GROW CACTUS
GC3uGpmvBS0_3 0 CACTUS OR CACTI IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE PLANT GROW NATURALLY IN THE DESERT
GC3uGpmvBS0_4 0 THEY'RE FOUND ALL OVER THE PLANET BUT USUALLY IN AREAS WITH VERY LITTLE RAINFALL
GC3uGpmvBS0_5 0 WELL IF YOU LIVE IN THE NORTHWEST LIKE I DO
GC3uGpmvBS0_6 0 WE CAN STILL GROW THEM WITHOUT LIVING IN THE DESERT
GC3uGpmvBS0_7 0 THEY DO REALLY WELL IN OUR CLIMATE AS WELL
GC3uGpmvBS0_8 0 SO THE TRICK WITH CACTI IS TO MAKE SURE TO ONLY PUT THEM OUTSIDE OVER THE SUMMER
GC3uGpmvBS0_9 0 IF YOU LIVE IN A COLD CLIMATE
GC3uGpmvBS0_10 0 AND MAKE SURE AND GROW THEM INSIDE IN THE WINTER
GC3uGpmvBS0_11 0 IF YOU GET BELOW MAYBE FIFTY DEGREES AT NIGHT
GC3uGpmvBS0_12 0 BECAUSE THEY REALLY DON'T WANT TO FREEZE
GC3uGpmvBS0_13 0 IF THEY FREEZE YOU WILL LOSE THEM
GC3uGpmvBS0_14 0 SO THEY'RE VERY EASY TO GROW
GC3uGpmvBS0_15 0 I JUST PUT THEM OUT ON MY DECK
GC3uGpmvBS0_16 0 AND THEY LOVE THE HOT SUN AND THEY LIKE TO DRY OUT IN BETWEEN
GC3uGpmvBS0_17 0 AND SO WHENEVER THE NIGHTS GET BELOW FIFTY I BRING THEM BACK INSIDE
GC3uGpmvBS0_18 0 AND THEY SEEM TO DO REALLY WELL THAT WAY
GC3uGpmvBS0_19 0 SO THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN GROW THEM
GC3uGpmvBS0_20 0 THE KEY WITH CACTUS IS TO NOT WATER THEM TOO MUCH
GC3uGpmvBS0_21 0 AND THIS IS JUST ONE IN A LITTLE BOWL
GC3uGpmvBS0_22 0 AND IT SEEMS TO REALLY LIKE IT
GC3uGpmvBS0_23 0 IT GETS LOTS OF MOISTURE THAT STAYS IN THERE
GC3uGpmvBS0_24 0 AND IT LOOKS NEAT THERE TOO
GC3uGpmvBS0_25 0 SO THERE'S LOT OF DIFFERENT CREATIVE WAYS THAT YOU CAN GROW THEM
GC3uGpmvBS0_26 0 AND I WATER THIS MAYBE ONCE A MONTH
GC3uGpmvBS0_27 0 VERY VERY LITTLE DO I WATER IT
GC3uGpmvBS0_28 0 THIS SMALL CACTUS I REALLY LIKE
GC3uGpmvBS0_29 0 IT'S A KIND OF EUPHORBIA WHICH ISN'T CONSIDERED A TRUE CACTUS
GC3uGpmvBS0_30 0 BUT IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL AND IT'LL JUST KEEP GROWING AND GROWING
GC3uGpmvBS0_31 0 AND I STARTED WITH A LITTLE ONE LIKE THIS ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO
GC3uGpmvBS0_32 0 AND THE LITTLE ONE NOW HAS TO BE TRANSPLANTED
GC3uGpmvBS0_33 0 BECAUSE IT'S GOT THIS BIG
GC3uGpmvBS0_34 0 I JUST LOVE
GC3uGpmvBS0_35 0 IT'S JUST GROWN AND GROWN AND GROWN
GC3uGpmvBS0_36 0 AND AS YOU CAN SEE I'M USING GLOVES WHEN I PLAY WITH THEM
GC3uGpmvBS0_37 0 BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY SHARP
GC3uGpmvBS0_38 0 AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW HARD IT IS TO GET THE LITTLE CACTUS LITTLE PRICKS BACK OUT OF YOUR SKIN
GC3uGpmvBS0_39 0 BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HARD
GC3uGpmvBS0_40 0 AND THEY COME IN ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES
GC3uGpmvBS0_41 0 AND THIS PARTICULAR CACTUS I LIKE TOO
GC3uGpmvBS0_42 0 IT'S VERY SHARP
GC3uGpmvBS0_43 0 SO YOU'VE GOT TO BE SO CAREFUL
GC3uGpmvBS0_44 0 AND I OVER WATERED IT SO THE THE MOTHER PLANT ACTUALLY STARTED DYING ON ME
GC3uGpmvBS0_45 0 IT JUST TURNED TO MUSH
GC3uGpmvBS0_46 0 SO I JUST BROKE OF THE TOP PARTS OF THE CACTUS
GC3uGpmvBS0_47 0 THAT STILL LOOKED GOOD
GC3uGpmvBS0_48 0 AND I PUT THEM BACK DOWN IN THE DIRT
GC3uGpmvBS0_49 0 AND THEY'RE NOW THEY'RE LIVING
GC3uGpmvBS0_50 0 EVEN WHEN YOU THINK YOU KILLED THEM
GC3uGpmvBS0_51 0 HALF THE TIME YOU CAN STILL TAKE PARTS THAT ARE STILL ALIVE
GC3uGpmvBS0_52 0 AND PUT THEM BACK DOWN INTO DIRT
GC3uGpmvBS0_53 0 AND THEY'LL GROW AGAIN
GC3uGpmvBS0_54 0 THAT'S WHY I LOVE THEM SO MUCH
GC3uGpmvBS0_55 0 SO I FOUND TOO IF THEY GET TOO BIG OR THEY START FALLING OVER
GC3uGpmvBS0_56 0 YOU CAN GIVE THEM A LITTLE BIT OF A HAIRCUT TOO
GC3uGpmvBS0_57 0 AND THESE ARE SO SHARP YOU'VE GOT BE SO CAREFUL
GC3uGpmvBS0_58 0 BUT LIKE ON THIS ONE WHEN YOU BREAK IT
GC3uGpmvBS0_59 0 IT ACTUALLY MAKES KIND OF A
GC3uGpmvBS0_60 0 IT GETS REALLY GOOEY LIKE ELMER'S GLUE
GC3uGpmvBS0_61 0 SO THE REAL DANGER THAT YOU HAVE WITH CACTUS IS WATERING THEM TOO MUCH
GC3uGpmvBS0_62 0 SO WHEN IN DOUBT DON'T WATER
GC3uGpmvBS0_63 0 THAT'S BEEN MY RULE OF THUMB
GC3uGpmvBS0_64 0 AND I ONLY WATER THEM MAYBE ONCE A MONTH IF THAT
GC3uGpmvBS0_65 0 THEN IN THE WINTER TIME MAYBE ONLY ONCE EVERY TWO MONTHS
GC3uGpmvBS0_66 0 AND I KIND OF LOOK AT THEM OR PUT MY FINGER INTO THE DIRT
GC3uGpmvBS0_67 0 AND YOU CAN KIND OF SEE IF THEY'RE WET ENOUGH OR NOT
GC3uGpmvBS0_68 0 YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO BE REALLY WET
GC3uGpmvBS0_69 0 YOU WANT THEM TO BE A LITTLE BIT ON THE DRY SIDE
GC3uGpmvBS0_70 0 SO THAT THEY'LL DO REALLY WELL
GC3uGpmvBS0_71 0 AND EVEN IF THEY DO DIE I TRY NOT TO TAKE IT PERSONALLY
GC3uGpmvBS0_72 0 BECAUSE YOU CAN ALWAYS GET A NEW START OFF OF ANOTHER ONE
GC3uGpmvBS0_73 0 AND THEY'RE SO EASY TO GROW
gedN9seQewQ_1 0 HI MY NAME IS ASHLEY LUDMAN FROM SEASIDE YOGA HERE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PILATES MATS
gedN9seQewQ_2 0 SO PILATES IF YOU ARE PRACTICING A MAT FORM OF PILATES YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL MAT
gedN9seQewQ_3 0 BECAUSE MANY OF THE EXERCISES YOU'LL BE ON THE MAT LYING DOWN SUCH AS AS THIS
gedN9seQewQ_4 0 AND IF YOU'RE ON YOUR BACK AND YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CUSHION SOME OF THE EXERCISES MIGHT BE A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR YOU
gedN9seQewQ_5 0 SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT MATS THAT WILL HELP YOU HOLD YOUR VARIOUS ALIGNMENTS AND EVEN WORK WITH AN ARTICULATED ACTIONS SO YOU'RE MOVING YOUR SPINE BONE BY BONE UPWARD TO WHERE YOU HAVE SOME CUSHION UNDERNEATH YOU
gedN9seQewQ_6 0 DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH CUSHION YOU NEED IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON YOUR COMFORT LEVEL
gedN9seQewQ_7 0 SO IF YOU'RE A LITTLE LESS PADDED YOURSELF YOU MAY WANT TO GO WITH A MAT THAT HAS A LITTLE GREATER CUSHION
gedN9seQewQ_8 0 OR DOUBLE UP A COUPLE OF TRADITIONAL YOGA MATS OR OR THREE EVEN TO GIVE YOU THAT THAT GREATER CUSHION
gedN9seQewQ_9 0 AND BECAUSE IN PILATES MAT WORK YOU'LL ALSO BE DOING SOME POSTURES WHERE YOU'LL BE ON YOUR HANDS AND FEET IN VARIOUS WAYS YOU WILL WANT TO HAVE SOME TRACTION SO YOU'LL GO SLIDING ALL OVER THE FLOOR
gedN9seQewQ_10 0 SO THOSE ARE MY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PILATES MATS AND JUST HOPE THAT YOU FIND ONE THAT YOU ENJOY
hbdvde0dTG0_1 0 HI I'M GAIL HOFFMAN FROM LIVINGSTON BEACH FLORIDA AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I AM GOING TO MAKE FOR YOU BAKED ALASKA
hbdvde0dTG0_2 0 OKAY SO OUR BAKED ALASKA
hbdvde0dTG0_3 0 WE ARE READY TO PUT OUR MERINGUE ON OUR BAKED ALASKA BASE
hbdvde0dTG0_4 0 I AM GOING TO START BY COATING THE ICE CREAM AND CAKE WITH THE MERINGUE
hbdvde0dTG0_5 0 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU BRING THE MERINGUE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE PAPER BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T IT IS GOING TO SLIDE AROUND THE TOP OF YOUR CAKE AND THAT WILL NOT BE GOOD
hbdvde0dTG0_6 0 YOU HAVE TO WORK KIND OF QUICKLY BECAUSE THE ICE CREAM KEEPS MELTING IT MELTS FAST ESPECIALLY UNDER HOT LIGHTS
hbdvde0dTG0_7 0 SO IF YOU WORK KIND OF QUICKLY BUT MAKE SURE YOU COAT IT COMPLETELY
hbdvde0dTG0_8 0 MAKE SURE YOU IN CASE THE ENTIRE THING BECAUSE IT IS CREATING A SORT OF INSULATION FOR THE ICE CREAM
hbdvde0dTG0_9 0 WHEN IT IS COMPLETELY COVERED YOU ARE GOING TO PUT IT BACK IN THE FREEZER
hbdvde0dTG0_10 0 YOU CAN PUT IN THE FREEZER FOR UP TO DAY AND THEN PUT IN THE OVEN RIGHT BEFORE YOU SERVE IT
hbdvde0dTG0_11 0 I AM GOING TO PUT IN AT LEAST FOR TWO HOURS TO GET IT NICE AND CHILLED
GtOH4JSl2Ic_1 0 HI MY NAME IS KEVIN AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO USE A BELT SANDER ON SOLID WOOD
GtOH4JSl2Ic_2 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO USE A BELT SANDER ON THIS PIECE OF OAK HERE AND WITH THIS SET UP WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THIS AS A NICE FLAT SURFACE AND TAKE THE REST OF THIS ROUGH DOWN TO WHERE IT'S SMOOTH LIKE THE REST OF THIS
GtOH4JSl2Ic_3 0 IF FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO A JOINER OR PLANER YOU COULD USE A BELT SANDER TO KEEP IT LEVEL AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THAT
GtOH4JSl2Ic_4 0 WITH THIS SETUP YOU WANT TO BE SURE TO HAVE A GUARD CLAMP BEHIND A STOP-CLAMP BEHIND THIS BOARD SO THAT WHEN THE BELT SANDER'S ON HERE IT DOESN'T JUST FLY OFF BECAUSE A BELT SANDER'S A VERY POWERFUL TOOL AND WILL THROW THIS PIECE AROUND BUT WE'VE GOT THIS STOP HERE AND THAT'S GOING TO KEEP THIS IN PLACE AS WELL AS LET THE BELT SANDER GO COMPLETELY AND COVER THE WHOLE AREA OF THE PIECE OF WOOD HERE
GtOH4JSl2Ic_5 0 IF WE WERE ACTUALLY CLAMPED TO THE PIECE IT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SAND THAT
GtOH4JSl2Ic_6 0 SO THIS ALLOWS US COMPLETE FREEDOM OF THE SURFACE OF THE WORK PIECE AND KEEPS IT FROM MOVING
GtOH4JSl2Ic_7 0 AS ALWAYS WHENEVER YOU OPERATE THE BELT SANDER YOU WANT TO BE SURE TO USE A DUST MASK AND HEARING PROTECTION
GtOH4JSl2Ic_8 0 SO WHEN WE START SANDING THIS PIECE WITH THE BELT SANDER YOU WANT TO KEEP THE BELT SANDER MOVING AT ALL TIMES
GtOH4JSl2Ic_9 0 IT IS A VERY POWERFUL MACHINE AND SO YOU WANT TO KEEP IT MOVING NEVER RESTING IN ONE AREA BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE A DIP IF YOU JUST LET IT SIT IN ONE AREA SO WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON JUST KEEPING IT MOVING WITH THE GRAIN AND THEN WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL TAKE IT OFF WE'LL GET A FLAT SURFACE AND WE'LL CHECK IT AND SEE WHAT AREAS WE NEED TO TAKE MORE OFF OF
GtOH4JSl2Ic_10 0 WE CAN MAKE A MARK WITH A PENCIL OR CHALK OR SOMETHING TO SHOW US WHERE WE NEED TO TAKE OFF MORE BUT INITIALLY WE'RE JUST GOING TO GET STARTED AND START FLATTENING THIS AND THEN WE'LL RE-EVALUATE UNTIL WE GET IT COMPLETELY FLAT
GtOH4JSl2Ic_11 0 ONCE WE'VE DONE SOME INITIAL BELT SANDING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GET A NICE GOOD FLAT STRAIGHT EDGE AND YOU'LL GO ALONG AND YOU'LL GET A READING
GtOH4JSl2Ic_12 0 TAKE A LOOK AND SEE WHAT IT'S TELLING YOU
GtOH4JSl2Ic_13 0 IT WILL BE HITTING THE HIGH POINTS AND SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO GO ALONG AND WHEREVER THE HIGH POINTS ARE IS TO COLOR THOSE IN AND THAT WAY YOU'LL KNOW WHERE YOU NEED TO TAKE OFF MORE
GtOH4JSl2Ic_14 0 AND SO BASICALLY WHAT'S BEING TOLD TO US HERE IS THAT WE WANT TO TAKE OFF MORE OFF OF ALL THE AREAS THAT WE'VE GOTTEN THIS SMOOTH SURFACE AND WHERE IT'S ROUGH WE NEED TO WAIT UNTIL WE TAKE THIS DOWN TO GET TO THE SAME LEVEL AS THAT
GtOH4JSl2Ic_15 0 AND THEN AS WE KEEP GOING IT'S GOING TO EVENTUALLY LEVEL ITSELF OUT
GtOH4JSl2Ic_16 0 SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY TO TELL IS YOU'LL SEE THESE ROUGH SPOTS AND YOU'LL KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE OFF MORE BUT FIRST YOU'VE GOT TO BRING THIS DOWN TO GET TO THE SAME LEVEL AS THAT AND THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO SMOOTH OUT ALL AS ONE SMOOTH SURFACE
Gxep5Y6JuHo_1 0 OUR RIDER IN TRAINING HAS STILL HER SNAFFLE IN HER SPLIT REINS AS WE WOULD GO TO COMPETITION WE'D PROBABLY PUT A MORE PERFORMANCE BIT AND OUR BARREL REINS ON TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN HOLD OUR REINS SNUGLY WITH A SHORT REIN WITH ONE HAND ON THE REINS HER RIGHT HAND SINCE SHE'S USING THE LEFT HAND FOR THE FLAG RETRIEVAL
Gxep5Y6JuHo_2 0 SHE'S GOING TO GO AROUND THE BARREL SHE'S GOING TO DO THIS AT THE JOG SO THAT SHE CAN BE SURE THAT SHE GIVES HER HORSE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICE WITH HIS MOST FOCUSED QUIET OPPORTUNITY
Gxep5Y6JuHo_3 0 NOW WE'LL PICK UP THE PACE AND SEE IF OUR RIDER CAN ALSO THEN PUT THAT COORDINATED EFFORT HER SHORT REIN RIGHT HAND ON THE REIN LEFT HAND READY TO SNAG THAT FLAG AND BRING IT ON HOME WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SPEED
Gxep5Y6JuHo_4 0 THE HORSE THAT'S WILLING TO STAY CLOSE TO THE BARREL THAT WAS VERY GOOD HELPS HER OUT
Gxep5Y6JuHo_5 0 SHE'S GOT HER A GOOD POSITION SHE'S STRONG IN HER SEAT SHE'S READY TO TRY TO USE THAT DART LIKE STICK IT
Gxep5Y6JuHo_7 0 THAT WAS A GOOD ROUND
Gxep5Y6JuHo_8 0 SO YOU CAN SEE WITH PRACTICE THIS RIDER CAN CONTINUE TO INCREASE HER SPEED AS HER ACCURACY STAYED CORRECT
Gxep5Y6JuHo_9 0 WE'D SEE THIS RIDER GO ON TO BECOME A VERY COMPETENT FLAG RACER AS SHE HAS PRACTICED AND SHOWN US GOOD SKILL TODAY
H0D7qlUWxcg_1 0 OKAY IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP GOING UP THE MUSICAL ALPHABET AND THE NEXT CHORD WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IS B MAJOR
H0D7qlUWxcg_2 0 NOW I SHOWED YOU THIS EARLIER
H0D7qlUWxcg_3 0 I'M SHOWING THIS IN A DIFFERENT POSITION
H0D7qlUWxcg_4 0 AS FAR AS THE BARRE CHORDS WE'RE GOING TO DO THE SAME POSITION AS WE DID IN THE PREVIOUS WITH A AND A SHARP FIRST FINGER SEVENTH FRET WHICH IS B THIRD FINGER NINTH FRET FOURTH FINGER ALSO NINTH FRET AND THEN YOUR MIDDLE FINGER OF COURSE IS ON THE EIGHTH FRET
H0D7qlUWxcg_5 0 WHEN YOU PLAY THIS CHORD IT WILL GO LIKE THIS NOW THE OTHER WAY TO PLAY THAT YOU COULD START FROM THE A STRING LIKE I SHOWED EARLIER WITH YOUR FIRST FINGER ON THE SECOND FRET ON THE A STRING WHICH IS B AS WELL AND WITH YOUR PINKIE ON THE D G AND B STRINGS AND GO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THAT HIGH B HERE LIKE YOU DO ON THIS ONE
H0D7qlUWxcg_6 0 BUT THAT'S TWO DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN DO BARRE CHORDS THE SAME CHORD
GDXX9hTxUB0_1 0 THIS COCKTAIL IS CALLED THE BULL RIDER
GDXX9hTxUB0_2 0 THIS COCKTAIL WAS INVENTED AT THE COUNTRY CONNECTION IN FORT WAYNE INDIANA
GDXX9hTxUB0_3 0 GO AHEAD AND ADD YOUR ICE TO YOUR GLASS TO START OUT WITH
GDXX9hTxUB0_4 0 WE'RE GOING TO DO AN OUNCE OF COCONUT RUM
GDXX9hTxUB0_6 0 WE'RE GOING TO DO AN OUNCE OF COFFEE LIQUEUR
GDXX9hTxUB0_7 0 WE'RE GOING TO DO HALF AN OUNCE OF CREME DE BANANA IN THAT GOES

GDXX9hTxUB0_11 0 JAGERMEISTER SOME BAD NIGHTS AT THE JAGERMEISTER
GDXX9hTxUB0_12 0 YOU'RE GOING TO FILL THE REST UP WITH SOME HALF AND HALF
GDXX9hTxUB0_13 0 SEE THAT LOOKS ABOUT RIGHT TO ME
GDXX9hTxUB0_15 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO MIX
GDXX9hTxUB0_16 0 THIS IS WHAT YOUR BULL RIDER IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE WITH ALL OF THOSE INGREDIENTS
GDXX9hTxUB0_17 0 SORT OF LOOKS LIKE CHOCOLATE MILK
GDXX9hTxUB0_18 0 IN ALL HONESTY GO AHEAD AND ADD A COCKTAIL STRAW AND YOU'RE GOOD TO GO
G5qDZI1tHbc_1 0 ALRIGHT NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ADVANCED CLAM SHELL
G5qDZI1tHbc_2 0 IT'S THE BASICS OF THE ORIGINAL ADDING THE ARM
G5qDZI1tHbc_3 0 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THINK OF YOUR BODY AS BEING ON A SEE SAW OR A TEETER TOTTER
G5qDZI1tHbc_4 0 REMEMBER IF YOU'VE GOT A BIG KID ON IT YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO ADJUST THE FULCRUM AT THE BOTTOM YOU HAVE TO ADJUST IT SO YOU DON'T FLY OFF
G5qDZI1tHbc_5 0 KEEPING THAT IN MIND ADJUSTING THE SHOULDER SO THE SHOULDER GOES BEYOND THE WEIGHT OF THE LEG
G5qDZI1tHbc_6 0 HAND IS DOWN TO SUPPORT YOU
G5qDZI1tHbc_7 0 YOU ARE ROLLING THE RIBS OPEN YOU ARE STILL ENGAGED ALRIGHT
G5qDZI1tHbc_8 0 AND THE BUTTOCK GOES SLIGHTLY FORWARD JUST DON'T WANT TO HANG FORWARD WITH YOUR CHEST THE CHEST IS OPEN
G5qDZI1tHbc_9 0 NOW THE HAND IS GOING TO OPEN THIS IS VERY MUCH LIKE A CLAM SHELL OPENING AND SHUTTING OR KIND OF LIKE A BUTTERFLY
G5qDZI1tHbc_10 0 SO FROM THIS POSITION SHUT AND OPEN SHUT AND OPEN
G5qDZI1tHbc_11 0 ALRIGHT MAKE SURE YOU ARE STAYING ENGAGED AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY HOLD THIS FOR QUITE A WHILE ONCE YOU'VE LEARNED HOW TO DO EVERYTHING IN THE CENTER
G5qDZI1tHbc_12 0 LOTS OF STUFF TO DO WITH YOUR CLAM SHELL
G5qDZI1tHbc_13 0 MAKE SURE YOU'RE BREATHING STAY ENGAGED THE SPINE IS NOW LONGER OVER THE CENTER OF YOUR LEG
G5qDZI1tHbc_14 0 USE YOUR BACK USE YOUR BREATH USE YOUR RIBS
G5qDZI1tHbc_15 0 AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO YOUR ADVANCED MODIFICATION FOR YOUR CLAM SHELL
hcfCa5uY_eE_1 0 SO NOW IT'S TIME TO GIVE OUR FISH A FACE
hcfCa5uY_eE_2 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO APPLY SOME EYES BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS ACTUALLY BACK IT UP WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SEQUINS TO MAKE THE EYES A LITTLE BIT MORE DRAMATIC SO WE'LL CHOOSE SOME LARGER SEQUINS
hcfCa5uY_eE_3 0 THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE THE SAME COLOR
hcfCa5uY_eE_4 0 WE'LL DO SOME GREENS
hcfCa5uY_eE_5 0 WE'RE GOING TO PUT A DOT OF GLUE WE'RE GOING TO FIND A PLACE ON THE FISH THAT CAN ACTUALLY HOLD THE GLUE AND HOLD THE EYES
hcfCa5uY_eE_6 0 I'M GOING TO PUT THIS IN PLACE LIKE THIS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A GOOGLY EYE PUT IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THAT WAY SEQUINS JUST MAKES A LITTLE BIT MORE REFLECTION AND FLAIR TO THE EYE
hcfCa5uY_eE_7 0 AND WE'LL DO THE SAME THING TO THE OTHER SIDE
hcfCa5uY_eE_8 0 ADDING A LITTLE BIT OF GLUE THE GREEN SEQUINS AND A LARGE GOOGLY EYE
hcfCa5uY_eE_9 0 THAT GLUE'S GOING TO DRY CLEAR SO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF WE GET IT ON ANY OTHER PART OF OUR FISH
hcfCa5uY_eE_10 0 TRY TO LINE THEM UP A LITTLE BIT BUT REALLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR A PLACE THAT'S A SMOOTH SURFACE TO GLUE THEM ON TO
hcfCa5uY_eE_11 0 IF THEY DON'T STICK ORIGINALLY WITH THE GLUE YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE A SMALL PIECE OF MASKING TAPE OR SCOTCH TAPE TO HOLD THEM DOWN AND THAT SHOULD HOLD THEM IN PLACE UNTIL THEY'RE DRY
HDeJa9QSwKI_1 0 JOEL SIEGEL ALRIGHT SO WE'LL DO ANOTHER ITERATION OF OUR THREE HI-HAT LIFTS HERE IN THE BAR
HDeJa9QSwKI_2 0 WE'LL GO AHEAD AND DO BEATS ONE THREE AND FOUR OKAY
HDeJa9QSwKI_3 0 THIS IS THE UPBEATS OF BEATS ONE THREE AND FOUR OKAY
HDeJa9QSwKI_4 0 THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS AS FAR AS WHERE THE HI-HAT IS COMING DOWN
HDeJa9QSwKI_5 0 I'LL GIVE A TASTE OF IT
HDeJa9QSwKI_6 0 THIS IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE
HDeJa9QSwKI_8 0 SO YOU COME IN WE HAVE THE UPBEAT TO ONE SO YOU'RE COMING DOWN ON TWO UPBEAT TO THREE SO YOU'RE COMING DOWN ON FOUR AND UPBEAT TO FOUR SO YOU'RE COMING DOWN ON ONE
HDeJa9QSwKI_9 0 SO LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT WHAT MY HANDS AND WHAT MY LEFT FOOT IS DOING FOR THAT PATTERN
H5lTdKpDw8I_1 0 OK MY BIG DOME SCRAPER HERE IS GOING TO BE REALLY THE TOOL I WANT FOR GOING IN HERE
H5lTdKpDw8I_2 0 BUT I WANT TO READJUST THIS TOOL REST
H5lTdKpDw8I_3 0 ON THE BOWL GOUGER IT DIDN'T MATTER SO MUCH THAT I READJUSTED BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME I WAS RUBBING OVER HERE AND I COULDN'T GET MUCH ADVANTAGE BY READJUSTING IT
H5lTdKpDw8I_4 0 BUT ON MY BOWL SCRAPER I'M GOING TO COME IN AND I'M GOING TO ADJUST IT
H5lTdKpDw8I_5 0 AGAIN MAKE SURE EVERY THING IS CLEAR
H5lTdKpDw8I_7 0 NOW THIS TOOL THE SCRAPER WORKS VERY WELL ON FLAT GRAIN DOWN IN THIS AREA WHERE THE GRAIN IS ALL THE SAME BUT IF I COME OVER IN TO THE SIDE GRAIN HERE OVER HERE I'VE GOT VERY LONG GRAIN AND HERE I'VE GOT IN GRAIN SHORT GRAIN
H5lTdKpDw8I_8 0 IN OTHER WORDS I'VE GOT HARD SOFT AND THAT CAUSES HAVOC WITH THE SCRAPER
H5lTdKpDw8I_9 0 YOU WILL GET A LOT MORE TEAR OUT AND EVEN CATCHING ON SOFT GRAINS
H5lTdKpDw8I_10 0 SO YOU WANT VERY CONSISTENT GRAINS
H5lTdKpDw8I_11 0 SO WITH MY SCRAPER I'M GOING TO GO FROM HERE TO ABOUT THERE AS FAR AS BLENDING THEM TOGETHER
H5lTdKpDw8I_12 0 MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS CLEAR AGAIN
H5lTdKpDw8I_13 0 ALWAYS START AT THE CENTER AND WORK OUT
H5lTdKpDw8I_14 0 I WANT TO TOUCH IT WHERE IT'S GOING THE SLOWEST AND THEN WORK IT OUT
H5lTdKpDw8I_15 0 ALSO NOTICE MY HAND IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO PULL THAT RIGHT ALONG THE TOOL REST
H5lTdKpDw8I_16 0 WORKING IN THE CENTER
H5lTdKpDw8I_17 0 THAT'S THE FARTHEST UP THE SIDE I DARE COME
H5lTdKpDw8I_18 0 SO I HAD TO DO A GOOD JOB WITH MY GOUGE HERE
H5lTdKpDw8I_19 0 I'VE BLENDED IT TOGETHER WITH MY BIG SCRAPER HERE
H5lTdKpDw8I_20 0 I WANT YOU TO TAKE A LOOK BACK HERE AND I WANT YOU TO NOTICE SOMETHING
H5lTdKpDw8I_21 0 THE SCRAPER IS WORKING AT A LITTLE BIT OF A ANGLE
H5lTdKpDw8I_22 0 WHEN OUR BOWL GOUGES WERE TURNING WE WERE LIKE THIS
H5lTdKpDw8I_23 0 IF WE DO THAT WITH THE SCRAPER WE ARE GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE
H5lTdKpDw8I_24 0 WE WANT THE HANDLE TO BE A LITTLE BIT POINTED DOWN SO IF IT CATCHES THIS EDGE WILL FALL FREE OF THE WOOD
H5lTdKpDw8I_25 0 IF IT'S LIKE THIS IT'S GOING TO DIG IN AND THEN FALL FREE SO I'M GOING TO KEEP IT WITH THE HANDLE UP
H5lTdKpDw8I_26 0 NOW THERE'S THE STEERING END UP A LITTLE BIT AND THAT'S WHERE I GET THE CONTROL
H5lTdKpDw8I_27 0 YOU ALSO SEE MY HANDS NICE AND BRACED ON HERE SO I CAN MOVE THEN AND THEN A NICE LIGHT TOUCH
H5lTdKpDw8I_28 0 THE SCRAPERS I'M USING JUST FOR A NICE LIGHT FINISHING CUT IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOWL
H5lTdKpDw8I_29 0 I'M THINK WE'RE READY TO GO AHEAD AND SAND
giPBW37u4QA_1 0 TODAY FOR KIDS SAFETY I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS THE IDEA OF BEING GRABBED FROM BEHIND WE'LL CALL THAT A BEAR HUG
giPBW37u4QA_2 0 IN THE UNFORESEEN INCIDENT THAT SOMEBODY CATCHES YOU BY SURPRISE AND THEY GRAB YOU FROM BEHIND SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO IS I USE THE WORD EXPLOSION
giPBW37u4QA_3 0 YOU USE YOUR ENTIRE BODY AND YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE YOUR BOTTOM OUT TO THE BACK
giPBW37u4QA_4 0 YOU ARE GOING TO USE YOUR ARMS AS A TOOL TO SLOWLY NOT SLOWLY BUT SLIGHTLY LOOSEN THEIR GRIP GIVING YOU JUST ENOUGH OPPORTUNITY TO ESCAPE SO AS YOU DO THIS THEY ARE GOING TO GRAB YOU FROM BEHIND AND YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE OUR REAR AND YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO THEIR STOMACH AREA AND ONE WAY TO REMEMBER THAT IS TO REMEMBER BUTT TO THE GUT SO YOU TAKE YOUR BOTTOM TO THEIR STOMACH AND YOUR ELBOWS ARE GOING TO TURN ELBOWS OUT THUMBS GOING DOWN AND IT LOOKS LIKE I CALL IT AN EXPLOSION BECAUSE YOU ARE USING YOUR WHOLE BODY JUST LIKE THAT
giPBW37u4QA_5 0 SO IF YOU ARE GETTING GRABBED FROM BEHIND THEN YOU ARE GOING TO DO THE EXPLOSION AND THEN USE YOUR HANDS AND PUSH MY ARMS UP DUCK UNDERNEATH AND ESCAPE AND THAT IS GOING TO BE A HELPFUL TOOL FOR YOU IN ORDER TO GET OUT OF THE BEAR HUG
giPBW37u4QA_6 0 SO LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN BOTTOM TO THEIR STOMACH THERE YOU GO OUT UNDERNEATH AND THEN YOU ESCAPE AND THAT'S AN ESCAPE FROM A BEAR HUG
HfjHHuqF7-s_1 0 OKAY NOW WE'VE COVERED WHAT IS RAW FOOD
HfjHHuqF7-s_2 0 SO LET'S COVER WHAT IS LIVING FOOD
HfjHHuqF7-s_3 0 I BRIEFLY WENT OVER THE FACT THAT IF THIS BROCCOLI WAS PICKED JUST PICKED THIS WOULD BE LIVING FOOD
HfjHHuqF7-s_4 0 BECAUSE IT WOULD STILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FACT THAT IT WAS STILL ATTACHED TO THE PLANT
HfjHHuqF7-s_5 0 THIS LIVING FOOD IS STAYS ALIVE FOR AT LEAST TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS
HfjHHuqF7-s_6 0 THEN AFTER THAT IT BECOMES RAW FOOD
HfjHHuqF7-s_7 0 HERE'S SOME OF OUR BEST SOURCES OF LIVING FOOD IS FRESH GREENS THAT ARE PICKED
HfjHHuqF7-s_8 0 THESE GREENS ARE FRESH AS LONG AS IT'S TWENTY FOUR TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS
HfjHHuqF7-s_9 0 AFTER THAT IT BECOMES RAW FOOD
HfjHHuqF7-s_10 0 ANOTHER GREAT SOURCE OF LIVE FOOD IS WHAT WOULD BE GROWING IN HERE THESE ARE CLOVER SPROUTS
HfjHHuqF7-s_11 0 THEY HAVEN'T QUITE SPROUTED YET THEY'VE SOAKED
HfjHHuqF7-s_12 0 WHEN THEY SPROUT THEY'LL BECOME NICE LITTLE SPROUTS AND WILL BE GREAT FOR WHAT WE CALL A LIVE FOOD
HfjHHuqF7-s_13 0 ANOTHER SOURCE FOR LIVE FOOD WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHICH IS A CRACKER WHICH HAS BEEN ALL THE SEEDS THAT WENT INTO THIS CRACKER WERE SOAKED
HfjHHuqF7-s_14 0 THEY WERE SOAKED FOR THE DESIGNATED TIME SO THAT THEY WOULD COME TO THE POINT OF SPROUT
HfjHHuqF7-s_15 0 THEN AT THAT POINT THEY WOULD MAY BE MADE INTO THE CRACKER AND THEREFORE THAT WOULD BE CALLED A LIVE RAW CRACKER
HhaguaPrhMY_1 0 HI I'M KAREN FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
HhaguaPrhMY_2 0 NOW I WOULD SHOW YOU HOW TO FOLD A QUEEN FLAT SHEET
HhaguaPrhMY_3 0 START BY FINDING THE TOP EDGE OF THE SHEET AND JUST RUN YOUR HANDS ALONG THAT SO IT IS ALL CLEAR
HhaguaPrhMY_4 0 THEN FOLD IT IN HALF RUN YOUR HAND ALONG THE EDGE TO THE NEXT CORNER AND WE WOULD FOLD THAT IN HALF
HhaguaPrhMY_5 0 OKAY WHEN YOU HAVE THE HALF YOU HAVE THE TOP CORNER AND THE BOTTOM CORNER YOU HOLD THEM BOTH TOGETHER AND FOLLOW THEM ALONG THE EDGE
HhaguaPrhMY_6 0 NOW IT IS GOOD TO TAKE YOUR OTHER HAND AND HOLD THE PART THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY LINED UP TOGETHER AND CONTINUE TO LINE UP THE SHEETS RUNNING YOUR HANDS ALONG BOTH THE TOP EDGE AND THE BOTTOM EDGE TOGETHER
HhaguaPrhMY_7 0 AS YOU CAN SEE I SHAKE IT FREQUENTLY JUST TO GET THE MATERIAL TO FALL TOGETHER
HhaguaPrhMY_8 0 NOW WE ARE GOING TO FOLD IT AGAIN YOU CAN DROP THAT IN FRONT OF YOU YOU ARE GOING TO FOLD IT AGAIN IN HALF PUTTING ALL FOUR CORNERS TOGETHER ONE TWO THREE FOUR CORNERS TOGETHER
HhaguaPrhMY_9 0 YOU WANT THE TOP EDGE TO BE OUTSIDE OKAY AND THEN JUST SHAKE THAT OUT UNTIL IT IS FLAT ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM
HhaguaPrhMY_10 0 NOW YOU MAY WANT TO FOLLOW YOUR HAND DOWN THE EDGE OF THE SHEET AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS FLAT DOWN THAT WAY
HhaguaPrhMY_11 0 THEN FOLLOW THE EDGE OF THE SHEET HERE AND OFTEN IT GETS A LITTLE BULKY ON THE BOTTOM SO YOU ARE SORT OF PULL THAT DOWN UNTIL IT IS FLAT
HhaguaPrhMY_12 0 SO NOW WE FOLDED OUR QUEEN SHEET IN QUARTERS NEXT WE ARE GOING TO FOLD IT IN HALF AGAIN ON THE SIDE EDGE

HCt8RHVZ3AI_2 0 THIS IS JOHN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
HCt8RHVZ3AI_3 0 IN THIS VIDEO CLIP I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO CHECK YOUR BRAKE FLUID LEVEL
HCt8RHVZ3AI_4 0 YOU WANT TO CHECK YOUR BRAKE FLUID LEVEL WHEN YOU CHECK ALL THE OTHER FLUIDS IN YOUR CAR WHICH SHOULD BE ABOUT ONCE A MONTH
HCt8RHVZ3AI_5 0 SOME CARS ARE EQUIPPED WITH A DASHBOARD LIGHT THAT TELLS YOU WHEN YOU ARE LOW ON BRAKE FLUID
HCt8RHVZ3AI_6 0 A LOW LEVEL OF BRAKE FLUID MAY INDICATE THAT YOU HAVE A LEAK IN YOUR BRAKING SYSTEM WHICH REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE
HCt8RHVZ3AI_7 0 THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DO IS OPEN YOUR HOOD AND LOCATE THE BRAKE MASTER CYLINDER
HCt8RHVZ3AI_8 0 TYPICALLY THIS IS LOCATED TOWARDS THE BACK OF THE CAR AND KIND OF A CENTRALIZED LOCATION OF THE ENGINE
HCt8RHVZ3AI_9 0 OUR IS LOCATED RIGHT HERE
HCt8RHVZ3AI_10 0 NEXT YOU WANT TO CLEAN OFF THE TOP OF THE MASTER CYLINDER WITH A RAG TO PREVENT ANY DIRT OR ROAD DEBRIS FROM ENTERING IT WHEN OPEN
HCt8RHVZ3AI_11 0 WHEN YOU OPEN THE CAP YOU WILL SEE FULL AND LOW LEVEL INDICATORS INSIDE OF THE RESERVOIR
G9Aw0VbIbdU_1 0 HI MY NAME IS FLOYD KUNZ
G9Aw0VbIbdU_2 0 I AM TALKING TO YOU FROM THE ACOUSTIC MUSICIAN IN SANDY UTAH TODAY AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AMPLIFIERS FOR ACOUSTIC ELECTRIC GUITARS
G9Aw0VbIbdU_3 0 ALRIGHT WHAT I HAVE HERE IS A COUPLE OF WHAT THEY CALL PRACTICE AMPS
G9Aw0VbIbdU_4 0 I HAVE AN ACOUSTIC AMP HERE AND I HAVE AN ELECTRIC AMP DOWN HERE
G9Aw0VbIbdU_5 0 THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ACOUSTIC AMPLIFIER AND AN ELECTRIC AMPLIFIER IS THE VOICING OF THE SPEAKER
G9Aw0VbIbdU_6 0 AN ELECTRIC AMPLIFIER HAS A TIGHTER A TIGHTER MID RANGE WHERE AN ACOUSTIC SPEAKER IS MORE LIKE SOMETHING YOU HAVE AT HOME STEREO BECAUSE IT HAS TO COVER A BROAD SPECTRUM OF FREQUENCIES
G9Aw0VbIbdU_7 0 WHICH AN ACOUSTIC GUITAR HAS
G9Aw0VbIbdU_8 0 ONE THING THAT USUALLY ALWAYS COMES WITH AN ACOUSTIC AMP IS WHAT THEY CALL AN XLR INPUT OR A MICROPHONE INPUT
G9Aw0VbIbdU_9 0 SO A LOT OF ACOUSTIC AMPS CAN BE A DUAL PURPOSE FOR ACOUSTIC ELECTRIC INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS BEING ABLE TO RUN A MICROPHONE THROUGH IT
HGS3cQfZ0Bs_1 0 NEXT AFTER WE'VE PREPPED OUR CONTAINER WE'RE GOING TO SELECT OUR GREENERY
HGS3cQfZ0Bs_2 0 SO I'VE GOT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FOLIAGES IN MY URN AND WE'RE GOING TO SELECT THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO LOOK THE BEST
HGS3cQfZ0Bs_3 0 IN THE URN THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF SPACE TO FILL TO COVER UP THE FLORAL FOAM SO WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO USE SOME LEAVES THAT ARE LARGER
HGS3cQfZ0Bs_4 0 NOT QUITE AS LARGE AS THE TEA LEAVES BECAUSE THIS JUST REALLY WOULDN'T FIT
HGS3cQfZ0Bs_5 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO TODAY WE'RE GOING TO SELECT THE LEMON LEAF WHICH SHOULD FILL IN NICELY
HGS3cQfZ0Bs_6 0 AND WE'LL ALSO USE SOME SEEDED EUCALYPTUS WHICH SHOULD ALSO BE A NICE ACCENT GREENERY
HGS3cQfZ0Bs_7 0 AND THEN WE'LL ALSO USE A LITTLE BIT OF PITTOSPORUM WHICH WILL FILL IN SOME OF THE HOLES AND ALSO ADD A NICE RICH COLOR WHICH ALSO ADDS DEPTH TO THE DESIGN
HGS3cQfZ0Bs_8 0 SO THIS IS HOW YOU SELECT YOUR FOLIAGE
GVskGmzBC7U_1 0 ALRIGHT TO DO THE BEGINNER AB ROLLER WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS WE ARE GOING TO TAKE OUR AB ROLLER WE ARE GOING TO POSITION OUR HANDS ON IT LIKE SO LIKE I SAID MINE IS A WHEEL
GVskGmzBC7U_2 0 MY HANDS COME ON BOTH SIDES
GVskGmzBC7U_3 0 OUR FEET OR OUR KNEES ARE ABOUT HIP WIDTH APART AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO TO BEGIN IS YOU ARE ONLY GOING TO DO ABOUT EIGHT TO TEN REPS FOR A BEGINNER
GVskGmzBC7U_4 0 YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GO OUT THAT FAR SO JUST COME OUT A LITTLE WAYS
GVskGmzBC7U_5 0 AND THEN BRING IT BACK IN
GVskGmzBC7U_6 0 JUST A LITTLE WAYS
GVskGmzBC7U_7 0 MAYBE EVEN THAT'S TOO FAR JUST COME OUT A COUPLE OF FEET
GVskGmzBC7U_8 0 AND ROLL IT BACK IN
GVskGmzBC7U_9 0 A COUPLE OF FEET AND ROLL IT BACK IN
GVskGmzBC7U_10 0 JUST LIKE THAT
GVskGmzBC7U_11 0 AND YOU WANT TO DO EIGHT TO TEN REPS
GVskGmzBC7U_12 0 THIS IS JUST TO GET YOU STARTED THIS IS A BEGINNER AB ROLLER EXERCISE
GVskGmzBC7U_13 0 YOU WANT TO PULL THAT BELLY BUTTON INTO THE SPINE MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING YOUR ABS AND NOT YOUR ARMS
GVskGmzBC7U_14 0 USE YOUR ABS
GVskGmzBC7U_15 0 JUST LIKE THIS
GVskGmzBC7U_16 0 AND AGAIN YOU WANT TO DO ABOUT EIGHT TO TEN OF THEM I THINK I GOT ABOUT TWO MORE TO GO HERE
GVskGmzBC7U_17 0 AND THAT IS HOW YOU DO AB ROLLER EXERCISES FOR THE BEGINNER
gPhNB-q7X6Q_1 0 ALRIGHT NOW IT'S TIME TO LEARN HOW TO ACTUALLY JUGGLE FIVE BALLS
gPhNB-q7X6Q_2 0 SO YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON YOUR THREE UP FLASHES WITH THE CLAP AND YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THREE UP FLASHES WITH THE FAKE THROWS AND YOU'VE GOTTEN IT DOWN TO WHERE YOU CAN THROW ALL FIVE AND ALL THE THROWS ARE EASILY MADE CATCHES ASSUMING THAT THEY DON'T BOUNCE OF YOUR HANDS BUT THEY ARE CATCHABLE CATCHES
gPhNB-q7X6Q_3 0 THE NEXT STEP IS TO THROW UP FIVE AND CATCH ALL FIVE
gPhNB-q7X6Q_4 0 SO JUST LIKE WE DID ON THE FLOOR I'M GOING TO START WITH THREE WHITE ONES IN ONE HAND AND TWO RED ONES IN THE OTHER BUT I'M GOING TO CATCH THEM ALL AND I'M GOING TO CATCH AND WHEN I END UP I WILL HAVE THE WHITE ONES IN THIS HAND AND THE RED ONES IN THE OTHER HAND
gPhNB-q7X6Q_5 0 SO THESE WILL ALL SWITCH HANDS AND IT LOOKS LIKE THIS
gPhNB-q7X6Q_6 0 JUST LIKE THAT
gPhNB-q7X6Q_8 0 THEN ONCE YOU'VE GOT THAT YOU CAN ADD ONE MORE THROW AND SO ON UNTIL YOU CAN KEEP IT GOING JUST LIKE YOUR THREE BALL PATTERN
HEtGHdBq2w0_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT UMBRELLAS
HEtGHdBq2w0_2 0 UMBRELLAS ARE PROBABLY THE MOST COMMON LIGHT MODIFIER THEY'RE ACTUALLY REALLY EASY TO USE
HEtGHdBq2w0_3 0 THEY STOW NICE AND EASILY AND YOU JUST POP THEM OPEN
HEtGHdBq2w0_4 0 THIS IS ACTUALLY A RELATIVELY SMALL ONE BUT THEY'RE EASY
HEtGHdBq2w0_5 0 THEY'RE USUALLY JUST ON THIS ONE JUST SLIPS NICE AND EASILY ONTO THE UMBRELLA HOLDER
HEtGHdBq2w0_6 0 UMBRELLAS THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT VARIETIES THEY COME IN ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES
HEtGHdBq2w0_7 0 THIS ONE'S ACTUALLY A RELATIVELY LARGE
HEtGHdBq2w0_8 0 THIS IS ACTUALLY NICE BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE BIT SOFTER THAN A ACTS A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE A SOFT BOX THAN A SMALLER ONE
HEtGHdBq2w0_9 0 IT ALSO COVERS A NICE WIDER AREA
HEtGHdBq2w0_10 0 LIKE THIS ONE'S ACTUALLY RELATIVELY SMALL
HEtGHdBq2w0_11 0 THIS ONE'S GOOD FOR TRAVELING
HEtGHdBq2w0_12 0 IT WORKS WELL BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARSHER THAN SOME OF THE OTHER LIGHTS
HEtGHdBq2w0_13 0 THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF NOW THEY'RE COMING OUT WITH ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF KIND OF LIKE A CROSS BETWEEN AN UMBRELLA AND A SOFT BOX
HEtGHdBq2w0_14 0 THIS IS A SOFT LIGHTER PHOTEK THESE ARE GETTING PRETTY POPULAR
HEtGHdBq2w0_15 0 IT SOFTENS UP IT'S AN UMBRELLA BUT IT SOFTENS UP THE LIGHT A LITTLE BIT MORE BY THROWING THE DIFFUSION ON THE TOP
HEtGHdBq2w0_16 0 THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY ONE I LIKE A LITTLE BETTER IT'S A LARSON PHOTO SQUARE
HEtGHdBq2w0_17 0 I THINK THEY ALSO MAKE THEM IN ROUND ONES TOO
HEtGHdBq2w0_18 0 BASICALLY IT ASSEMBLES LIKE AN UMBRELLA YOU CAN SEE ON THE INSIDE AND THEN YOU CAN PUT IT ON YOUR UMBRELLA HOLDER AND THEN YOU CAN PULL THE PULL IT UP AND OVER
HEtGHdBq2w0_19 0 USUALLY YOU POINT THE LIGHT INTO THE REFLECTIVE SIDE AND IT ACTUALLY WORKS AS A REALLY NICE SOFT BOX
HEtGHdBq2w0_20 0 THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH
HEtGHdBq2w0_21 0 THEY DON'T WORK SO WELL THEY WORK THEY DON'T WORK SO WELL WITH THESE KINDS OF LIGHTS BECAUSE YOU ADJUST THEM ON THE SIDE
HEtGHdBq2w0_22 0 OTHER UMBRELLA THAT IS REALLY POPULAR IS A YOU CAN GET A SHOOT-THROUGH UMBRELLA AND THESE ARE NICE
HEtGHdBq2w0_23 0 THESE ACTUALLY SOFTEN UP THE LIGHT A LITTLE BIT MORE
HEtGHdBq2w0_24 0 YOU CAN KIND OF SHOOT DIRECTLY INTO SOMETHING
HEtGHdBq2w0_25 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE THEM TO BOUNCE LIGHT
HEtGHdBq2w0_26 0 NOT QUITE AS EFFICIENT AS THE AS A STANDARD WITH THE BLACK ON THE BACK BUT THEY WORK REALLY GOOD
gJf2P07j2ts_1 0 BEFORE WE BEGIN TURNING I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SAFETY
gJf2P07j2ts_2 0 WOOD TURNING CAN BE DANGEROUS IF YOU DON'T OBSERVE THE PROPER SAFETY
gJf2P07j2ts_3 0 MAKE SURE BEFORE YOU USE ANY EQUIPMENT IN THE SHOP THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE MANUALS THAT ACCOMPANY THEM
gJf2P07j2ts_4 0 WHEN I TURN I ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT I WEAR A FACE SHIELD SAFETY GLASSES
gJf2P07j2ts_5 0 I WEAR A GLOVE ON MY LEFT HAND BUT THE FINGERS ARE CUT OFF SO THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT COULD GET CAUGHT IN THE PIECE WHILE IT IS TURNING
gJf2P07j2ts_6 0 I ALSO DON'T WEAR ANY LOOSE CLOTHING
gJf2P07j2ts_7 0 I DON'T WEAR ANY JEWELRY THAT IS GOING TO HANG AROUND MY NECK OR MY WRIST BECAUSE THAT COULD GET CAUGHT IN THE PIECE OF MACHINERY OR IN THE PIECE ITSELF AND I CAN BE INJURED
gJf2P07j2ts_8 0 IF I AM ALSO WORKING WITH WET WOOD I AM ALWAYS WEARING A SMOCK WITH A HIGH COLLAR
gJf2P07j2ts_9 0 WET WOOD WILL SPRAY WATER EVEN DRY WOOD CAN HAVE CHIPS THAT GO DOWN THE BACK OF MY NECK
gJf2P07j2ts_10 0 I DON'T LIKE CHIPS DOWN THE BACK OF MY NECK BECAUSE IT GETS INTO MY CLOTHING AND IT FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE
gJf2P07j2ts_11 0 MOST IMPORTANT NEVER TRY TO WORK IF YOU ARE TIRED NEVER TRY TO TURN IF YOU HAVE CONSUMED ALCOHOL OR HAVE TAKEN ANY DRUGS
gJf2P07j2ts_12 0 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU OBSERVE THESE SAFETY MEASURES
gsU5HQneuEo_1 0 BESIDES YOUR STONE AND YOUR STEEL THERE ARE OTHER PRODUCTS OUT ON THE MARKET
gsU5HQneuEo_2 0 THERE ARE TRI-STONES THAT COME WITH THREE DIFFERENT STONES WITH THREE GRADES OF ABRASIVES
gsU5HQneuEo_3 0 A NEWER TECHNOLOGY IS DIAMOND STONE
gsU5HQneuEo_4 0 THIS IS ACTUALLY A PIECE OF FORM PLASTIC THAT HAS DIAMOND IN A METAL MESH ON TOP
gsU5HQneuEo_5 0 THESE ARE GREAT
gsU5HQneuEo_6 0 THEY ACTUALLY WORK FASTER THAN A CONVENTIONAL STONE BUT THEY COST TWICE AS MUCH NOT QUITE AS COST EFFECTIVE
gsU5HQneuEo_7 0 ANOTHER REALLY GOOD PRODUCT OUT ON THE MARKET IS CALLED THE LANSKY SYSTEM
gsU5HQneuEo_8 0 THERE ARE DIFFERENT VARIATIONS ON THIS SYSTEM
gsU5HQneuEo_9 0 WITH THIS YOU ACTUALLY CLAMP THE KNIFE IN THIS LITTLE JIG AND THIS JIG HOLDS THE KNIFE AT THE SAME ANGLE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT CONCENTRATING ON THE ANGLE
gsU5HQneuEo_10 0 IT'S GOT THE ATTACHMENTS IT'S GOT THE ANGLES ALREADY IN IT
gsU5HQneuEo_11 0 WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS SET AT A TWENTY SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND STICK IT IN AT TWENTY DEGREES
gsU5HQneuEo_12 0 BASICALLY YOU CAN JUST RUB IT IN CIRCLES RIGHT DOWN THAT EDGE
gsU5HQneuEo_13 0 WHATEVER YOU DO TO ONE SIDE YOU NEED TO DO TO THE OTHER
gsU5HQneuEo_14 0 THIS WILL GET IT SHARP BUT AFTER YOU USE THIS SYSTEM AGAIN YOU NEED TO GO TO THE LEATHER STROP AND FINISH OFF STROPPING IT
gsU5HQneuEo_15 0 YOU WANT TO AVOID ANY KIND OF APPARATUS THAT YOU DRAG YOUR KNIFE THROUGH
gsU5HQneuEo_16 0 THIS WILL PUT A REALLY BLUNT EDGE ON IT AND MOST OF THESE THINGS ARE CARBIDE
gsU5HQneuEo_17 0 THEY END UP TAKING OFF METAL AT A REALLY BLUNT ANGLE
gsU5HQneuEo_18 0 YOU WILL GET A BURR UP THERE THAT YOU CAN USE LIKE A SAW BUT IT TAKES OFF TOO MUCH METAL AND APPLIES THE WRONG ANGLE
gsU5HQneuEo_19 0 SO YOU WANT TO AVOID ANYTHING THAT YOU HAVE TO DRAG YOUR KNIFE THROUGH OR YOU DRAG DOWN THE EDGE
gvbQLdPva8g_2 0 THE LAST ONE OUT OF THE ELBOW STRIKES IS THE DOWN ELBOW STRIKE THIS IS IDEALLY IF A PERSON IS ALREADY ON THE GROUND WHERE YOU HAVE EASY ACCESS O.K
gvbQLdPva8g_3 0 SO WE HAVE A PERSON DOWN ON THE GROUND I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE FIRST JUST THE MOVEMENT YOU'RE GOING TO START WITH THE STAGGERED STANCE BOTH HANDS ARE UP NOW TO GENERATE POWER FOR THAT FOR THE STRIKE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THE HAND STRIKING IS GOING TO MAKE A CIRCLE THAT'S GOING TO CLOSE AND YOU'RE GOING TO DROP THAT BODY WEIGHT STRAIGHT DOWN ON YOUR TARGET
gvbQLdPva8g_4 0 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OTHER ELBOW STRIKES AN NOW IS WE'RE STRIKING THE PART BEHIND YOUR ELBOW TOWARD YOUR TRICEP AREA THAT'S THE THE PART OF YOUR ELBOW THAT'S GOING TO HIT YOUR TARGET RIGHT NOW
gvbQLdPva8g_5 0 SO START RIGHT HERE AS WE MOVE IN TOWARD THAT OPPONENT MALE A CIRCLE TIGHTEN THAT WRIST UP AND STRIKE I WANT TO DROP MY WHOLE BODY WEIGHT DOWN OVER THAT PERSON
gvbQLdPva8g_7 0 ONE MORE TIME SLOW I'M GOING TO STEP IN MAKE A FULL CIRCLE AND CLOSE THAT HAND AND DROP MY BODY DOWN
gvbQLdPva8g_8 0 NOW I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE WE HAVE A TARGET HERE O.K
gvbQLdPva8g_9 0 SOMEBODY'S ALREADY ON THEIR KNEES O.K
gvbQLdPva8g_10 0 I CAN BE IN THE FRONT OF HIM AND I CAN DO THE SAME THING IDEALLY I WANT TO HOLD ONTO MY TARGET TO CONTROL HIM
gvbQLdPva8g_12 0 I'M GOING TO STEP IN I'M GOING TO STRIKE DOWN TO THE NOSE STRAIGHT IN DROP MY BODY WEIGHT
gvbQLdPva8g_13 0 IT ALSO WORKS IF YOU HAVE A PERSON YOU'RE BEHIND HIM YOU WANT TO HAVE A NICE TIGHT GRIP OF THAT HEAD YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO PULL THE NECK BACK AND THE HEAD BACK SO WHEN YOU HIT YOU HIT OVER THE NOSE THE RIDGE OF THE NOSE
gvbQLdPva8g_14 0 SO ONE MORE TIME AND DROP THAT ELBOW STRAIGHT DOWN OVER THE PERSON O.K
gvbQLdPva8g_15 0 SO THAT'S OUR DOWN ELBOW STRIKE
gvbQLdPva8g_16 0 NEXT WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON SOME SLIPPING AND DODGING PUNCHES
gLfQVd0NHg0_1 0 HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT VENEERS ARE
gLfQVd0NHg0_2 0 WELL MY NAME IS MICHELLE AND I'M A DENTAL ASSISTANT WITH SOLUTIONZ AND I'M HERE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THE TRUE MEANING OF VENEERS
gLfQVd0NHg0_3 0 BASICALLY VENEERS IS ANOTHER FORM OF A CROWN BUT IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BECAUSE A CROWN COVERS THE FULL BODY OF THE TOOTH
gLfQVd0NHg0_4 0 AND WITH VENEERS IT ONLY COVERS THE FACIAL SURFACE OF YOUR TOOTH
gLfQVd0NHg0_5 0 SO WHAT I MEAN BY FACIAL SURFACE I JUST MEAN THE FRONT PART OF YOUR TOOTH
gLfQVd0NHg0_6 0 AND BASICALLY IT'S AN EASY PROCEDURE TO HAVE DONE
gLfQVd0NHg0_7 0 YOU WOULD NEED TO SEE YOUR GENERAL DENTIST TO DETERMINE IF YOU WOULD BE A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR A VENEERS NOT EVERYBODY OR NOT EVERY TOOTH IS A CANDIDATE FOR VENEERS
gLfQVd0NHg0_8 0 SO BASICALLY WHAT THEY DO IS THEY GO IN WITH THE DRILL THEY KIND OF JUST SHAVE DOWN THE FRONT PART OF YOUR TOOTH
gLfQVd0NHg0_9 0 A LITTLE BIT ON THE BACK PART OF YOUR TOOTH ALSO AND BETWEEN YOUR TEETH
gLfQVd0NHg0_10 0 THEY TAKE AN IMPRESSION AFTER THE PREPARATION IS DONE
gLfQVd0NHg0_11 0 THEY SEND THAT OFF TO A DENTAL LAB TECHNICIAN AND THEN THEY COME BACK WITH BASICALLY A VENEER
gLfQVd0NHg0_12 0 IT LOOKS IT'S A PORCELAIN BASED MATERIAL
gLfQVd0NHg0_13 0 IT'S ALL PORCELAIN
gLfQVd0NHg0_14 0 AND THEY JUST CEMENT IT ON THE FRONT PART OF YOUR TOOTH
gLfQVd0NHg0_15 0 VENEERS ARE A GREAT TREATMENT OPTION FOR IF YOU WANT THAT INSTANT BRACES INSTANT WHITENING BECAUSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY PICK THE SHADE OF THE TEETH
gLfQVd0NHg0_16 0 THE SHAPE OF THEM ALSO
gLfQVd0NHg0_17 0 SO YOU CAN KIND OF PICK THE COLOR AND THE SHAPE
gLfQVd0NHg0_18 0 IF YOU WANT THEM LONG IF YOU WANT THEM SHORT OR BOXY
gLfQVd0NHg0_19 0 WHATEVER BASICALLY AESTHETICALLY LOOKS PLEASING TO YOU
gLfQVd0NHg0_20 0 SO ONCE AGAIN MY NAME IS MICHELLE AND I'M A DENTAL ASSISTANT WITH SOLUTIONZ AND I JUST EXPLAINED TO YOU THE DEFINITION OF VENEERS
gdiPM3Nueik_1 0 JOEL SIEGEL ALRIGHT

gdiPM3Nueik_9 0 I LIKE MINE RIGHT ABOUT THERE ALRIGHT
gdiPM3Nueik_10 0 SO WE'VE GOT THE DOWNBEAT OF TWO
gdiPM3Nueik_11 0 WE'VE ALSO GOT THE DOWNBEAT OF TWO IN THIS MUTED CYMBAL OVER HERE AND THEN WE'VE GOT THE UPBEAT OF TWO IN THE CYMBALS SINCE WE'RE KEEPING THOSE STRAIGHT EIGHTHS ONE-AND TWO-AND
gdiPM3Nueik_12 0 AND THEN THE LAST THING WE HAVE THAT'S KIND OF IN THE PARENTHESIS AND THE BRACKETS OF BEAT TWO WE HAVE A SIXTEENTH NOTE AT THE VERY END OF BEAT TWO THE LAST SIXTEENTH NOTE
gdiPM3Nueik_13 0 SO WE COUNT SIXTEENTH NOTES ONE-E OR IN THIS CASE TWO-E-AND-A SO WE HAVE TWO-E-AND-A IN THE KICK OKAY
gdiPM3Nueik_14 0 SO TWO SORRY
gdiPM3Nueik_17 0 AND THE AND THIS SIXTEENTH NOTE WE'LL TALK ABOUT IN THE NEXT CLIP IS NOT A STRAIGHT SIXTEENTH NOTE IT'S A SWUNG SIXTEENTH NOTE
gdiPM3Nueik_18 0 SO TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEXT CLIP TO GET AN IDEA OF A CERTAIN FLAVOR THAT'S GOING TO COLOR THIS WHOLE ENTIRE BEAT AND ALL THE RHYTHMS THAT YOU'RE PLAYING

HaHUG4K5v5c_9 0 AND IT DOESN'T HURT THE CAT
HaHUG4K5v5c_10 0 THEY MIGHT NOT LIKE IT
HaHUG4K5v5c_11 0 KITTIES DON'T LIKE ANYTHING THEY ARE NOT IN CONTROL OF
HaHUG4K5v5c_12 0 AND YOU GO OVER
HaHUG4K5v5c_13 0 YOU CAN SEE A DIFFERENCE ALREADY
HaHUG4K5v5c_14 0 THE COAT IS STARTING TO I KNOW

GRa3kKp83EM_1 0 HI I'M ANN MYRICK AND TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DESIGN AN CONTEMPORARY LIVING ROOM
GRa3kKp83EM_2 0 THIS IS A SMALL LIVING ROOM AND I ALREADY HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF THE BONES KIND OF STARTING OUT QUASI-CONTEMPORARY WITH THE RUSIRITE CHAIRS WHICH ARE CONTEMPORARY AND A FEW OTHER PIECES
GRa3kKp83EM_3 0 I'M ECLECTIC SO I REALLY LIKE HAVING IF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A CONTEMPORARY ROOM MAYBE THROWING IN ONE OR TWO THINGS THAT MAY BE AREN'T TOTALLY 100 %PERCENT CONTEMPORARY JUST TO KIND OF ADD A LITTLE BIT OF ENERGY AND ADD A LITTLE BIT OF SURPRISE BUT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS HOW YOU HOW I WOULD MAKE THIS ROOM MORE CONTEMPORARY VERY QUICKLY
GRa3kKp83EM_4 0 CONTEMPORARY LOOK IS MORE VERY MINIMAL
GRa3kKp83EM_5 0 A LOT OF TIMES YOU TAKE YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THINGS SO LIKE IN THIS SITUATION I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS BOWL DOWN AND I'M GOING TO MOVE MY LAMP OVER AND I'M GOING TO TAKE ALL THESE LITTLE SMALL PIECES AWAY
GRa3kKp83EM_6 0 ON THIS TABLE I'M GOING TO TAKE THE SMALL ACCESSORIES AWAY
GRa3kKp83EM_7 0 NOW I MIGHT ADD TO IT AT SOME POINT BUT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS JUST CREATE A REAL CREATE A STRAIGHT LINE AND CREATE JUST A MINIMAL VERY CLEAN VERY PLAIN LOOK
GRa3kKp83EM_8 0 WITH THE COFFEE TABLE IS REALLY FINE IF FOR 100 %PERCENT CONTEMPORARY PERSON YOU JUST TAKE AWAY OR ADD TO TO WHAT YOUR TASTE IS
GRa3kKp83EM_9 0 THE CHEST WOULD NOT BE NECESSARILY CONTEMPORARY SO YOU COULD TAKE AWAY OR YOU CAN REALLY JUST LEAVE THEM JUST FOR A LITTLE ADDED SURPRISE JUST HAVE THEM JUST STARK WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE WOOD
GRa3kKp83EM_10 0 I WOULD TAKE AWAY ALL THE ADDED PILLOWS
GRa3kKp83EM_11 0 OVER HERE I HAVE TWO FRAMES THAT ARE MORE HAVE AN ARCHITECTURAL FEEL TO THEM AND A TRAY
GRa3kKp83EM_12 0 YOU COULD I WOULD PROBABLY KEEP THIS TABLE BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T LIKE TABLES THAT HAVE THE EXACT AMOUNT OF THINGS ON EACH ONE OF THEM
GRa3kKp83EM_13 0 THIS ONE IS VERY MINIMAL
GRa3kKp83EM_14 0 THIS ONE HAS A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT I WOULD KEEP IT LIKE THAT JUST TO ADD TO IT
GRa3kKp83EM_15 0 THIS IS ANN MYRICK AND THAT IS HOW TO DESIGN A CONTEMPORARY LIVING ROOM
H0z1emB8Wr4_1 0 SO OUR NEXT STRETCH IS GOING TO BE CALLED SIDE TO SIDE
H0z1emB8Wr4_2 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR FEET ARE EVENLY ON THE SIDES OF YOUR MATS AND YOUR WEIGHT IS DISTRIBUTED EVENLY
H0z1emB8Wr4_3 0 YOU'RE GOING TO REACH YOUR ARMS STRAIGHT UP TOWARDS THE CEILING
H0z1emB8Wr4_4 0 SO MAKE SURE WHEN YOU REACH YOUR ARMS UP YOU WANT TO KEEP THOSE SHOULDERS DOWN SO PRESSING THEM DOWN YOUR BACK
H0z1emB8Wr4_5 0 PULL THE NAVEL INTO TOWARD THE SPINE
H0z1emB8Wr4_6 0 YOU'RE GOING TO REACH UP AND OVER ON THE LATERAL SIDE
H0z1emB8Wr4_7 0 SO REACH UP AND OVER TOWARDS YOUR RIGHT SIDE
H0z1emB8Wr4_8 0 AS YOU CAN SEE ALEX IS KEEPING HIS HIPS HERE
H0z1emB8Wr4_9 0 YOU WANT TO KEEP THEM RIGHT THERE
H0z1emB8Wr4_10 0 REACH UP AND OVER
H0z1emB8Wr4_11 0 REACH LONG AS YOU COME UP AND EXHALE ON THE LEFT SIDE
H0z1emB8Wr4_12 0 SO REACH LONG AND LEAN LIKE MISS CARRIE OVER HERE
H0z1emB8Wr4_14 0 AND STRETCH ALL THE WAY UP
H0z1emB8Wr4_15 0 SO YOU'RE STILL USING YOUR OBLIQUE S HERE KEEPING THAT NAVEL SCOOPED IN THOSE RIBS ARE CLOSED IN
H0z1emB8Wr4_16 0 HE'LL REACH UP OVER AND OVER STRETCH LONG AND THEN EXHALE LIFT
H0z1emB8Wr4_17 0 AGAIN AND LEFT SIDE
H0z1emB8Wr4_18 0 UP AND OVER AND BACK TO CENTER
H0z1emB8Wr4_19 0 FROM HERE YOU'RE GOING TO FACE YOUR LEGS
H0z1emB8Wr4_20 0 YOU'RE GOING TO FACE TOWARDS THE RIGHT SIDE
H0z1emB8Wr4_21 0 YOU'RE GOING TO TWIST THAT WAISTLINE
H0z1emB8Wr4_22 0 REACH UP AND OVER AND FORWARD
H0z1emB8Wr4_23 0 AND THEN EXHALE RIGHT BACK UP
H0z1emB8Wr4_24 0 SO YOU WANT TO GET THAT FLAT BACK THAT NAVEL SCOOPED IN AGAIN REACH UP AND OVER AND RIGHT SIDE
H0z1emB8Wr4_25 0 AND EXHALE LIFT BACK THROUGH CENTER TWIST TOWARDS YOUR LEFT SIDE AND REACH UP AND OVER
H0z1emB8Wr4_26 0 SO YOU WANT TO REACH THE FINGERTIPS AS LONG AS POSSIBLE KEEPING THE SHOULDERS AWAY FROM THE EARS NAVEL SCOOPS IN TO LIFT YOU RIGHT BACK UP

H0z1emB8Wr4_28 0 THAT WAS STRETCH SIDE TO SIDE
H0z1emB8Wr4_29 0 OUR NEXT STRETCH WILL BE THE RUNNER'S STRETCH
GIrFdm3jclI_1 0 WHILE OUR NOODLES ARE COOKING WE CAN GO AHEAD AND START PREPARING OUR INGREDIENTS FOR THE SAUCE
GIrFdm3jclI_2 0 SO FIRST WE'RE GOING TO POUR OUR MILK
GIrFdm3jclI_3 0 AGAIN YOU CAN USE TWO %PERCENT OR WHOLE MILK GET SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 1/2 CUP OR 3/4 OF CUP OF MILK
GIrFdm3jclI_4 0 THEN YOU ARE GOING TO NEED TO MEASURE OUR BUTTER BUTTER IF YOU DON'T KNOW HAS TABLESPOONS MARKED ON THE SIDE SO WE'RE GOING TO USE TWO TABLESPOONS OF BUTTER
GIrFdm3jclI_5 0 I TOOK MY SERRATED KNIFE AND FOUND TWO TABLESPOONS AND CUT IT THEN OUR CHEESE
GIrFdm3jclI_6 0 THIS IS AN EIGHT OZ BLOCK OF CHEESE THAT I SET ON THE PLATE THAT I'LL LATER USE TO SERVE THE MACA-RAMONS AND CHEESE
GIrFdm3jclI_7 0 I THINK WE'RE GOING TO USE ABOUT HALF OF THAT TODAY SO THAT WILL BE FOUR OZ OF CHEESE
GIrFdm3jclI_8 0 THIS IS MOZZARELLA THAT I SHOWED YOU EARLIER
GIrFdm3jclI_9 0 WE DECIDED TO USE MOZZARELLA TODAY INSTEAD OF THE HAVARTI OR THE MUNSTER AND WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO IS ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR HALF OF EIGHT OZ BLOCK OF CHEESE I'M JUST GOING TO CUBE IT
GIrFdm3jclI_10 0 I'M GOING TO SLICE IT INTO LITTLE CUBES
GIrFdm3jclI_11 0 THIS WILL INCREASE THE SURFACE AREA OF THE CHEESE AND MAKE IT MELT FASTER
GIrFdm3jclI_12 0 SO THE SMALLER YOU CUT YOUR CHEESE THE QUICKER IT'S GOING TO MELT AND THE SOONER YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR MACA-RAMON AND CHEESE
gT2qb1ZOH1g_1 0 NOW AS I LOOK AT THIS I'M NOTICING THAT I'M MISSING THE GAP BETWEEN HERE AND THE EDGE OF OUR VASE
gT2qb1ZOH1g_2 0 AND THERE'S SOME OF THE WALL SHOWING THROUGH UNDERNEATH THIS TRAPEZOID SHAPE THAT REPRESENTS OUR GREENERY
gT2qb1ZOH1g_3 0 SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND USE MY YELLOW TO BRING IN SOME OF THOSE COLORS
gT2qb1ZOH1g_4 0 THIS IS THE TOP OF OUR VASE
gT2qb1ZOH1g_5 0 SO I'LL USE MY YELLOW TO BRING THAT IN
gT2qb1ZOH1g_6 0 AND THE REASON I'M USING YELLOW IS I WANT TO CREATE SOME CONTRAST SO THAT WHEN I PUT THE GREENERY IN HERE
gT2qb1ZOH1g_7 0 IF I USE A GREEN BACK HERE THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH CONTRAST
gT2qb1ZOH1g_8 0 SO I'M GOING TO USE THE LIGHTER COLOR YELLOW AS A WAY OF BRINGING SOME OF THAT SHAPE IN
gT2qb1ZOH1g_9 0 AND THEN I'M GOING TO REFINE THE EDGE OF THIS WITH THE SAME YELLOW AND THE EDGE OF THAT POT OR THE VASE WITH THE SAME YELLOW UNTIL IT COMES DOWN AND HITS THE BACK OF OUR KITTY CAT
gT2qb1ZOH1g_10 0 AND I'M GOING TO DO THE SAME THING OVER HERE AND TRY AND START TO REFORM AND RESHAPE THE EDGE OF OUR POT IN THE FOREGROUND
gT2qb1ZOH1g_11 0 AND THEN WE HAVE A LEAF THAT'S IN THE WAY
gT2qb1ZOH1g_12 0 AND NOW WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THESE OBJECTS START TO SEPARATE AND HAVE SOME FORM AND SHAPE CREATING THE OUTSIDE SHAPE
gT2qb1ZOH1g_13 0 AND LET'S GO AHEAD AND ADD THAT IN THERE
gT2qb1ZOH1g_14 0 BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO A CLEAR AREA THAT I CAN SEE QUITE CLEARLY
gqelBghTY4M_1 0 THIS IS EILEEN DEY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND IN THIS SEGMENT WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT THE MERIDIAN CHANNELS ARE WITHIN THE HUMAN BODY
gqelBghTY4M_2 0 MERIDIAN CHANNELS ARE PATHWAYS JUST LIKE ARTERIES AND VEINS
gqelBghTY4M_3 0 THEY SUPPLY BLOOD AND ALLOW IT TO CIRCULATE ALL THROUGH OUR ORGANS AND OUR SYSTEMS
gqelBghTY4M_4 0 MERIDIANS SUPPLY CHI OR KEY WHICH IS SOURCE OR ENERGY THAT GLOWS AND NOURISHES OUR BODY MIND AND SOUL
gqelBghTY4M_5 0 CHINESE MEDICINE PRACTITIONERS ACCESS MERIDIANS THROUGH ACUPRESSURE AND ACUPUNCTURE
gqelBghTY4M_6 0 WAYS OF TAPPING IN AND HELPING REMOVE BLOCKAGES THAT GET STUCK ALONG THESE PATHWAYS LIKE HIGHWAYS THAT TRAVERSE THE WHOLE LENGTH OF OUR BEING FROM OUR HEAD TO OUR TOE
gqelBghTY4M_7 0 IN THIS NEXT SEGMENT WE WILL TALK ABOUT ACUPRESSURE AND ACUPUNCTURE

gM7VwBR7vjE_1 0 OK NOW SOMETIMES WHAT HAPPENS IS YOUR GOING TO GET AN ALGAE BUILD UP ON THE SIDE OF YOUR TANKS
gM7VwBR7vjE_2 0 NOW THE FISH DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT THEY COULD CARE LESS
gM7VwBR7vjE_3 0 THEY PROBABLY EVEN LIKE IT
gM7VwBR7vjE_4 0 BUT WE HAVE THE FISHES SO THAT WE CAN ENJOY THEM
gM7VwBR7vjE_5 0 SO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEE THEM LITTLE FISHES AND SO WE WANT TO GET THE ALGAE OFF
gM7VwBR7vjE_6 0 IF YOUR SNAILS AND PLECOSTOMUS ARE NOT DOING THE JOB FULLY
gM7VwBR7vjE_7 0 IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO INVEST IN ONE OF THESE MAGNET ALGAE SCRUBBERS
gM7VwBR7vjE_8 0 THEY'RE KIND OF PRICEY

gM7VwBR7vjE_11 0 IT'LL PICK UP THAT ALGAE VERY EASILY AND IT'LL STICK TO THE SURFACE OF THE ALGAE SCRAPER
gM7VwBR7vjE_12 0 YOU GOING TO GET A LOT OF ALGAE GUNK AND SO ON ON THIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT
gM7VwBR7vjE_13 0 FOR THE CORNERS IT MIGHT BE WORTHWHILE TO GET AN ALGAE SCRUBBER FOR THE CORNERS CAUSE THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT BETTER ABOUT GETTING IN THE CORNERS
gM7VwBR7vjE_14 0 THE REASON WE MIGHT NOT WANT TO USE THIS ONE ON THE SIDES IS YOU MIGHT HAVE PLANTS HERE THAT ARE GOING TO BE DISTURBED IF YOU USE THIS BIGGER TOOL
gM7VwBR7vjE_15 0 BUT FOR THE CORNERS WE LIKE TO SEE YOU GET IN WITH THIS AND THIS ALSO IS FAIRLY EASY TO USE TOO AND CAN GET THE JOB DONE AS WELL
HeWsukelbVg_1 0 JOHN SEXTON HI I'M JOHN SEXTON ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
HeWsukelbVg_2 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE LEARNING HOW TO PLAY PORTAL A GAME BY VALVE SOFTWARE A COMPANY WITH WHICH I HAVE NO AFFILIATION
HeWsukelbVg_3 0 SO NOW WE SEE THAT WE'VE GOT A MOVING ELEVATOR PUZZLE HERE AND A DANGEROUS FLOOR
HeWsukelbVg_4 0 SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS USE THE PORTALS QUICKLY IN SUCCESSION TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE
HeWsukelbVg_5 0 SO WE CAN PUT AN ENTRANCE ANYWHERE
HeWsukelbVg_6 0 WE'LL PUT ONE RIGHT HERE AND THEN WE'LL PUT OUR FIRST EXIT PORTAL RIGHT HERE
HeWsukelbVg_7 0 NOW WE CAN WATCH AND SEE WHEN AN ELEVATOR'S COMING SO WE KNOW WHEN IT'S SAFE
HeWsukelbVg_8 0 WE CAN HURRY UP AND GET ON THAT ELEVATOR AND MAKE OURSELVES A NEW ENTRANCE
HeWsukelbVg_9 0 WE CAN JUMP ONTO THAT ONE AND QUICKLY SHOOT ANOTHER EXIT PORTAL PUT AN EXIT RIGHT THERE AND NOW WE CAN PUT OUR ENTRANCE ANYWHERE AND POP OUT AND NOW WE'RE SAFE FROM THE DANGERS OF THAT PART
HeWsukelbVg_10 0 SO WE CAN SEE HERE THAT WE'VE GOT OUR POWER BALL DISPENSER AN ELEVATOR A DOOR THAT'S BLOCKING A POWER BALL RECEPTACLE AND ANOTHER ELEVATOR OVER HERE
HeWsukelbVg_11 0 SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GET ON THIS ONE AND IT'LL TAKE US UP TO THE FIRST BUTTON WHICH OPENS THE FIRST OF THE DOORS
HeWsukelbVg_12 0 WE CAN SEE ACROSS THE WAY THAT THERE'S ANOTHER BUTTON THAT OPENS THE SECOND DOOR
HeWsukelbVg_13 0 SO WE WANT TO GET OUR PORTALS SET UP SO THAT WE CAN OPEN BOTH OF THEM QUICKLY
guCbqRafvKE_1 0 JOHN SEXTON HALO THREE IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF BUNGIE SOFTWARE A COMPANY WITH WHICH I HAVE NO AFFILIATION
guCbqRafvKE_2 0 NOW THIS AREA IS BLOCKADED SO I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE MY CHOPPER THROUGH BUT I CAN STILL USE THE MACHINE GUNS TO TAKE OUT AS MANY COVENANT AS POSSIBLE BEFORE I MOVE FORWARD
guCbqRafvKE_3 0 THERE'S A BUNCH OF BRUTES AND SEVERAL OF THEM HAVE JET PACKS SO THIS WOULDN'T BE AN EASY FIGHT ON FOOT BUT THE CHOPPER MACHINE GUN IS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO TAKE THEM OUT QUICKLY AND IT DOESN'T RUN OUT OF AMMUNITION
guCbqRafvKE_4 0 SO AS LONG AS I CAN STAY ON MY CHOPPER I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THESE GUYS OUT PRETTY EASILY
guCbqRafvKE_5 0 HERE WE ARE
guCbqRafvKE_6 0 I'M NOW SEEING THE REAL BLOCKADE HERE

guCbqRafvKE_9 0 AGAIN I WANT TO TRY TO USE THE CHOPPER'S MACHINE GUNS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
guCbqRafvKE_10 0 THERE'S A MOUNTED GUN OFF IN THE DISTANCE THERE BUT WE JUST TOOK THAT OUT
guCbqRafvKE_11 0 WE WANT TO TRY TO LURE OUT THE BRUTES INDIVIDUALLY AS MUCH AS WE CAN BECAUSE THEY GET MUCH MORE POWERFUL WHEN THEY'RE WORKING IN A GROUP
guCbqRafvKE_12 0 SO IF WE CAN SINGLE THEM OUT AND TAKE THEM OUT ONE AT A TIME THAT'S MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE THAN DIVIDING YOUR FIRE BETWEEN A GROUP OF THEM
gv-1VdViimc_1 0 SO I'M GOING TO START BY TAKING WHAT I DECIDE AS THE UNDER LAYER WHICH ARE THE PIECES THAT ARE UNDERNEATH ALL OF THE OTHER PIECES MORE AND BEGIN BY LAYING THOSE OUT THE SAME WAY THAT I LAID OUT THE FIRST PIECES THAT I WORKED ON
gv-1VdViimc_2 0 SOMETIMES YOU CAN USE YOUR BRUSH TO LIFT THE PIECE UP AS WELL IF YOU ARE TRYING TO WORK QUICKLY AND YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO KEEP CHANGING YOUR TOOLS BY PUTTING ONE DOWN AND LIFTING UP YOUR EXACTO KNIFE
gv-1VdViimc_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO JUST TAKE THIS NOW AND LAY IT OUT FROM EDGE TO EDGE
gv-1VdViimc_4 0 I'M GOING TO USE MY FINGERS INITIALLY
gv-1VdViimc_5 0 THAT'S WHY YOU ALWAYS WANT A CLEAN RAG NEARBY TO WIPE YOUR FINGERS OFF AFTERWARDS SO THAT YOU ARE NOT GETTING GLUE ON ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE TOUCHED
gv-1VdViimc_6 0 THEN I'M GOING TO LAY OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ADHESIVE THERE AND I'M GOING TO GO ON TO MY NEXT PIECE THAT I CONSIDERED AN UNDER LAYER LAY IT OUT ON TO THE PLEXIGLAS ROLL IT OVER TO ONE SIDE ROLL IT OVER TO THE OTHER AND AGAIN LAY IT OUT ON TO THE SURFACE OF MY COLLAGING MATERIAL

HeuaDZ6gvMM_4 0 THIS ONE IS MY PFD DESIGNED FOR MY SIZE THIS IS A STYLE THAT YOU PUT ON OVER YOUR HEAD SO IT IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THEN THE OTHERS
HeuaDZ6gvMM_5 0 IT IS ALSO A RESCUE PFD SO IT HAS SPECIAL ACCESSORIES TO HELP IF YOU HAVE TO DO A RESCUE WHEN YOU ARE ON THE RIVER
HeuaDZ6gvMM_6 0 ONE THING ABOUT PFDS AND LET ME PUT THE ONE THAT IS TO BIG ON SO YOU CAN SEE THE PROBLEMS IF YOU HAVE A ILL FITTING PFD
HeuaDZ6gvMM_7 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE WHEN YOU PUT A PFD ON THAT IT FITS YOU AND IF SOMEBODY PULLS IT PULLS YOU INTO A RAFT OR A CANOE THAT IT DOESN'T COME SLIDING UP OVER YOUR HEAD
HeuaDZ6gvMM_8 0 YOU CAN SEE HOW LOOSE THIS IS ON ME IF SOMEBODY TRIED TO PULL ME IN I WOULD BASICALLY THE PFD WOULD COME RIGHT OFF SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE NICE AND SNUG AND MAKE SURE THAT IT FITS SMOOTHLY
HeuaDZ6gvMM_9 0 IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE A NICE FITTING PFD I THINK I SHOULD GET A BETTER SIZE THEN THIS ONE
GJFwVmnM5kY_1 0 KNEELING SIDE CRUNCH WITH BALL WITH FITNESS BALL SUPPORT
GJFwVmnM5kY_2 0 IT'S A MOUTHFUL I KNOW BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO REMEMBER THE NAME ALL YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THE EXERCISE
GJFwVmnM5kY_3 0 I'M HERE TO REMIND YOU OF THE NAME IF I CAN SAY IT AGAIN YOU YOU OWE ME MONEY
GJFwVmnM5kY_4 0 ANYWAY IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE POSITIONING OF THE BALL I RECOMMEND THAT YOU WATCH THE CLIP WITH THE POSITIONING SO YOU LEARN HOW TO GET THE BALL CORRECTLY
GJFwVmnM5kY_5 0 I'M JUST GOING TO GO VERY QUICKLY THROUGH IT
GJFwVmnM5kY_6 0 I'M GOING TO WEDGE AND I'M GOING TO PUSH PUSH WITH MY OUTSIDE LEG AND THERE I AM IN POSITION
GJFwVmnM5kY_7 0 NOW THIS LEG HAS TWO OPTIONS IF YOU'RE STARTING TO DO THIS EXERCISE JUST KEEP IT RIGHT HERE
GJFwVmnM5kY_8 0 IT CAN EVENTUALLY GO EXTENDED THAT'S A LITTLE MORE CHALLENGING SO WE'LL KEEP IT HERE FOR NOW
GJFwVmnM5kY_9 0 YOUR HAND CAN GO ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR
GJFwVmnM5kY_10 0 IF YOU'RE STARTING WITH THIS EXERCISES I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS IS THE WAY YOU START
GJFwVmnM5kY_11 0 IF YOU'RE NOT REACHING THE FLOOR THAT MEANS THE BALL IS TOO BIG FOR YOU SO ADJUST THE SIZE ACCORDINGLY OR YOU CAN DO IT RIGHT HERE
GJFwVmnM5kY_12 0 NOW ALSO THERE'S GOING TO BE A TENDENCY FOR THE SHOULDER TO COLLAPSE SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SHOULDER IS PULLED BACK THAT THE CHEST IS OPEN THE HEAD IS GOING TO BE ALIGNED WITH THE REST OF THE SPINE
GJFwVmnM5kY_13 0 SO IF YOU NOTICE AS I'M TALKING TO YOU I'M NOT TRYING TO LOOK AT YOU LIKE THIS I'M STAYING THIS WAY CAUSE THIS IS THE WAY THAT I CAN MAINTAIN THE SPINAL POSITIONING CORRECTLY
GJFwVmnM5kY_14 0 SO NOW MY HANDS GOING TO BE BY MY SIDE AND AS I I TAKE AN INHALE AND AS I EXHALE I'M GOING TO LIFT
GJFwVmnM5kY_15 0 NOW IF YOU NOTICE I'M LIFTING A LITTLE BIT OFF THE FLOOR RIGHT HERE
GJFwVmnM5kY_16 0 SO THAT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU LIMITED MOTION BUT THAT'S OK TO START
GJFwVmnM5kY_17 0 IF YOU'RE RIGHT HERE YOU CAN GO A LITTLE FURTHER
GJFwVmnM5kY_18 0 BUT I'M GOING TO CAUTION YOU NOT TO PUSH IT'S NOT A PUSH WITH THE ARM
GJFwVmnM5kY_19 0 THIS IS BASICALLY JUST TO SUPPORT YOU A LITTLE BIT
GJFwVmnM5kY_20 0 IF YOU NOTICE IT'S VERY LIGHT I'M DOING THE CRUNCH FROM THE SIDE
GJFwVmnM5kY_21 0 AND THE MORE CHALLENGING POSITION YOU'RE GOING TO SLIDE THE HAND DOWN THE THIGH AND COME ON IN WITH AN INHALE AND EXHALE
GJFwVmnM5kY_22 0 THE BALL SHOULD STAY PRETTY STEADY
GJFwVmnM5kY_23 0 SOMETIMES YOU MAY NEED A LITTLE PADDING ON THE KNEE OR THE RIGHT MAT SO YOUR KNEE IS NOT DIGGING INTO THE FLOOR
GJFwVmnM5kY_24 0 THAT'S QUITE PAINFUL AND IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN
GJFwVmnM5kY_25 0 MAKE SURE YOU DO TO BOTH SIDES
GJFwVmnM5kY_26 0 YOU WILL FIND THAT SOMETIMES THERE'S AN AN AN UNBALANCE AND ONE SIDE WILL BE FRIENDLIER THAN THE OTHER
GJFwVmnM5kY_27 0 DON'T WORRY THAT'S NORMAL JUST KEEP TRYING AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT YOU'LL HAVE A BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL STRONG CORE
GJFwVmnM5kY_28 0 SEE YOU SOON
GQ5iTrh_Klk_1 0 OK NOW WE'RE BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL BOARD TO LOOK AT THE WIDTH OF THE BOARD
GQ5iTrh_Klk_2 0 NOW THIS IS A 1X12 BOARD BUT OF COURSE IT'S NOT TWELVE INCHES WIDE IT'S ELEVEN AND 3/8 INCHES WIDE
GQ5iTrh_Klk_3 0 WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO CUT THIS BOARD DOWN TO ELEVEN INCHES SO THAT ALL OF THESE BOARDS ARE THE SAME WIDTH
GQ5iTrh_Klk_4 0 WE'RE MAKING A NUMBER OF BOOK CASES TODAY SO THEY ALL HAVE TO BE THE SAME WIDTH
GQ5iTrh_Klk_5 0 SO AFTER THIS HAS BEEN CUT TO LENGTH AT THE HOME STORE I BRING THE BOARDS HOME AND ON MY TABLE SAW I RIP THEM TO ELEVEN INCHES WIDE
GQ5iTrh_Klk_6 0 YOU WANT TO DO THAT WITH ALL OF YOUR CUT PIECES AT ONCE
GQ5iTrh_Klk_7 0 CUT THEM ALL TO ELEVEN INCHES WIDE
GQ5iTrh_Klk_8 0 THESE SHELFS ARE 25 1/2 INCHES WIDE BECAUSE 3/4'S OF AN INCH THE THICKNESS PLUS 25 1/2 INCHES PLUS ANOTHER 3/4'S ON THIS END ADDS UP TO 27 INCHES
GQ5iTrh_Klk_9 0 SO WHATEVER THE WIDTH OF YOUR BOOK CASE IS GOING TO FINALLY BE THE SHELVES ARE ALWAYS AN INCH AND A HALF LESS THAN THE TOTAL WIDTH OF THE BOOKCASE
GQ5iTrh_Klk_10 0 SO I'VE GOT THIS ALL RIPPED OUT NOW AND IT'S CUT TO THE RIGHT LENGTH IT'S RIPPED TO THE RIGHT WIDTH
GQ5iTrh_Klk_11 0 I'VE ALREADY SANDED IT A LITTLE BIT GET THE DIRT OFF AND EVERYTHING AND MAKE IT A NICE CLEAN BOARD AND NOW WE'RE READY TO START MEASURING FOR SHELVES AND MEASURING FOR PLACES THAT WE ARE GOING TO PUT SCREW HOLES

hF5zFRAgI5A_8 0 I DID DO A CHART ONE TIME WITH SEVEN HUNDRED NAMES ON IT AND IT TOOK ME THE ENTIRE SUMMER AND OF COURSE I WASN'T GATHERING THE INFORMATION
hF5zFRAgI5A_9 0 BUT YOU'LL NOTICE ONE THING MY COUSIN BETTY IS A BIRD WATCHER SO I WOUND UP PAINTING LITTLE BIRDS ALL AROUND AND BECAUSE THE HERITAGE ON BOTH SIDES WAS FROM ITALIAN FROM ITALY I PUT A MAP OF ITALY ON THERE
hF5zFRAgI5A_10 0 BUT YOU KNOW IT ALL STARTS OUT WITH A BASIC FORMAT AND THEN I ADDED SOME GOLD AND LOTS OF DECORATION AND I ALSO LEFT A LOT OF ROOM DOWN HERE FOR ADDING NAMES
hF5zFRAgI5A_11 0 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEST THING OF ALL IS THAT ONCE YOU HAVE ONCE I HAD THE ORIGINAL DONE THEN I HAD COPIES MADE THAT WERE SMALL ENOUGH SO THAT THOSE COPIES COULD THEN BE PUT ON A PLAIN OLD KODAK COPIER MACHINE SO THAT EVERYONE WHO CAME TO THIS CELEBRATION THIS EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION GOT TO TAKE AWAY A COPY OF THE CHART
hF5zFRAgI5A_12 0 SO THE CHART WAS A SURPRISE IT WAS IN A FRAME BUT EVERYBODY GOT TO TAKE AWAY A COPY
hF5zFRAgI5A_13 0 SO THERE'S OTHER WAYS THAT YOU CAN PLAY WITH THE IDEA OF GENEALOGY CHARTS AND THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THEM WHERE I WAS HIRED TO DO HERE'S A GRANDFATHER TURNING SEVENTY AND THE IDEA WAS TO MAKE A TREE AND THEN TO PUT ALL THE GRANDCHILDREN'S NAMES ON THE TREE
hF5zFRAgI5A_14 0 ANOTHER SWEET JOB FOR ME TO DO NAMES CAUSE I LOVE TO DO NAMES
hF5zFRAgI5A_15 0 SO GENEALOGY CHARTS ARE AN IDEA
gHvH9lKbkiY_1 0 THIS IS EILEEN DEY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND IN THIS SEGMENT WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE IDEA OF YIN-YANG
gHvH9lKbkiY_2 0 SO IT IS SYMBOLIC OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF DAOISM
gHvH9lKbkiY_3 0 IT IS REPRESENTED BY TWO HALVES OF A WHOLE
gHvH9lKbkiY_4 0 THE DARK IS THE FEMININE AND THE LIGHT IS HE MASCULINE
gHvH9lKbkiY_5 0 THE DARK IS RECEPTIVE AND THE LIGHT IS THE OUTPUT
gHvH9lKbkiY_6 0 EACH PIECE HAS MASCULINE AND FEMININE EMBEDDED IN IT
gHvH9lKbkiY_7 0 EACH PIECE REPRESENTS THE POLARITY OF OUR EXISTENCE AND YET DAOISM ALSO UNDERSTANDS THAT THE LINE BETWEEN THE TWO THE LINE BETWEEN THE MALE AND THE FEMALE IS THE LINE OF TRANSCENDENCE
gHvH9lKbkiY_8 0 IN THE MIDDLE SO TO SPEAK THERE ARE NO DIFFERENCE THERE ARE NO BARRIERS THERE IS THE WHOLE
gHvH9lKbkiY_9 0 IN THIS NEXT SEGMENT WE WILL TALK ABOUT AN INTRODUCTION TO CONFUCIUS
Gd6fxHXZAeY_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS DAVID BROWN AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO PREVENT CHAFING AND CHAFING IS A TERRIBLE THING
Gd6fxHXZAeY_2 0 NOBODY WANTS CHAFING AND THERE'S VERY EASY WAYS TO PREVENT IT
Gd6fxHXZAeY_3 0 FIRST OF ALL YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT YOUR CLOTHING
Gd6fxHXZAeY_4 0 WHETHER IT'S YOUR RUNNING SHORTS YOUR RUNNING SHIRT YOUR TOP YOUR BRA
Gd6fxHXZAeY_5 0 WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO WEAR AND GO OUT ON A RUN WITH MAKE SURE THAT YOU'VE TRIED IT BEFORE
Gd6fxHXZAeY_6 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOU LOOK FOR ANY RUB POINTS EXPOSED SEAMS
Gd6fxHXZAeY_7 0 ANYWHERE THAT'S ON THE ACTUAL CLOTHING ITEM THAT YOU CAN PREDICT WOULD BE A CHAFE POINT
Gd6fxHXZAeY_8 0 WHERE ARE MOST CHAFE POINTS
Gd6fxHXZAeY_9 0 WELL TYPICALLY THEY'RE UNDER YOUR ARMPITS BETWEEN YOUR LEGS WHERE YOUR THIGHS RUB TOGETHER NEAR YOUR FEET
Gd6fxHXZAeY_10 0 ANY KIND OF CHAFE POINT WHERE THE CLOTHING DOESN'T FIT EXACTLY RIGHT SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING
Gd6fxHXZAeY_11 0 MAKE SURE YOU BUY CLOTHING THAT FITS YOUR BODY STYLE THAT FITS YOUR ACTIVITY LEVEL
Gd6fxHXZAeY_12 0 NOW THE NEXT THING IS NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF ACTIVITY YOU'RE DOING IF YOU'RE DOING IT FOR A LONG TIME AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE WET AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE WET FROM SWEATING A LOT
Gd6fxHXZAeY_13 0 IT'S VERY NATURAL
Gd6fxHXZAeY_14 0 CHAFING COULD OCCUR IF YOU DON'T PUT SOME SORT OF LAYER ON AND WHAT I MEAN BY LAYER IS SOME SORT OF PETROLEUM JELLY
Gd6fxHXZAeY_15 0 THERE'S A THING CALLED BODY GLIDE AND ANY OTHER KIND OF A SLIPPERY OILY SUBSTANCE THAT YOU CAN PUT ON A CHAFE POINT SO TYPICALLY PUTTING A LITTLE BIT OF VASELINE OR PETROLEUM JELLY UNDERNEATH YOUR ARM PITS ON YOUR INNER THIGHS PERHAPS ON YOUR TOES OR AROUND YOUR NECK ARE GOOD POINTS TO PREVENT CHAFING
Gd6fxHXZAeY_16 0 NOW THE LAST THING IS YOU WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT KIND OF ACTIVITY YOU'RE DOING
Gd6fxHXZAeY_17 0 IF YOU'RE DOING RUNNING PERHAPS YOU WANT TO WEAR SOMETHING LIKE A RUNNING TIGHT OR PERHAPS SPANDEX SHORTS
Gd6fxHXZAeY_18 0 THESE WILL ALSO PREVENT CONTACT POINTS OF YOUR SKIN BETWEEN YOUR THIGHS
Gd6fxHXZAeY_19 0 IF YOU'RE CYCLING YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD PAIR OF CYCLING SHORTS THAT FIT YOU WELL THAT HAVE A GOOD WHAT WE CALL A SHAMMY PAD OR A PAD THAT PROTECTS YOUR UNDERCARRIAGE FROM THE SADDLE
Gd6fxHXZAeY_20 0 NOW WITH THESE GOOD CLOTHING YOU MAY ALSO WANT TO ADD IN SOME PETROLEUM JELLY ON THOSE RUB POINTS BUT THE COMBINATION OF THOSE APPROPRIATE CLOTHING NOT ONLY FOR YOUR BODY STYLE BUT THE APPROPRIATE CLOTHING FOR YOUR SPORTING EVENT AND USING SOME SORT OF LAYER SUCH AS PETROLEUM JELLY OR BODY GLIDE WILL HELP PREVENT CHAFING IN YOUR NEXT EVENT
hgq5Ft1qOu8_1 0 DURING THIS SESSION WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE BODY THAT WE HAVE JUST SEPARATED AND MOUNT IT ON THE LATHE
hgq5Ft1qOu8_2 0 ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS TO DO IS GET A BLOCK OF WOOD MOUNTED INTO THE LATHE
hgq5Ft1qOu8_3 0 YOU WANT TO BRING THIS BLOCK TO ROUND AND CUT TWO SHOULDERS ON IT
hgq5Ft1qOu8_4 0 THE SMALLER SHOULDER IS TO BE ONE AND 1/16 OF AN INCH TO FIT INTO THE BORED HOLE AND THE SECOND ONE JUST SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN ONE AND 5/8 OF AN INCH JUST TO GIVE YOURSELF SOME CLEARANCE
hgq5Ft1qOu8_5 0 WHEN YOU PUT THE TWO TOGETHER YOU SHOULD ALMOST BE ABLE TO HAVE THE PIECE SIT BY ITSELF ON THE ONE AND 1/16 INCH HOLE BRING UP YOUR TAIL STOCK WITH A CONE CENTER AND THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO SQUARE THINGS UP
hgq5Ft1qOu8_6 0 WHAT I'LL ALSO DO AT THIS POINT BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT SAW MARKS AND OTHER MARKS FROM THE PARTING TOOL I'LL SQUARE UP THE TOP END OF THE BODY
hgq5Ft1qOu8_7 0 ONE OF THE CHECKS YOU WANT TO DO WITH THIS IS LAY YOUR TOOL AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE BODY AND WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
hgq5Ft1qOu8_8 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY LIGHT OR SLIGHT DEPRESSION UNDERNEATH
hgq5Ft1qOu8_9 0 YOU WANT TO SEE THAT IT'S EITHER FLAT OR CONCAVE
hgq5Ft1qOu8_10 0 THAT WAY WHEN YOU PUT THE TOP ON YOU WILL GET A NICE TIGHT EVEN FIT
H9VekekALAc_1 0 HI I'M AMELIA AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'LL BE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THE LAWS OF HAIR COLOR
H9VekekALAc_2 0 DEPOSIT-ONLY COLOR DOES EXACTLY THAT
H9VekekALAc_3 0 IT ONLY DEPOSITS COLOR ON THE HAIR SHAFT
H9VekekALAc_4 0 IN OTHER WORDS IT WILL LAY A COAT COLOR JUST ON THE HAIR SHAFT
H9VekekALAc_5 0 SO IT'S REALLY KIND OF A STAIN
H9VekekALAc_6 0 THESE ARE YOUR GLAZES OR YOUR TONERS
H9VekekALAc_7 0 THESE ARE GREAT FOR IF YOU'VE GOT SOME BLONDE HIGHLIGHTS AND YOU'RE JUST WANTING TO TONE THEM DOWN THEY'VE GOTTEN TOO LIGHT OVER THE SUMMER
H9VekekALAc_8 0 YOU COULD GO IN WITH A DEPOSIT-ONLY AND JUST APPLY IT
H9VekekALAc_9 0 AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT TURNING STRANGE COLORS TURNING GREEN OR PURPLE OR PINK UNLESS YOU'VE GOT OVER POROUS ENDS
H9VekekALAc_10 0 SO YOU KNOW WITH DEPOSIT-ONLYS YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH THEM
H9VekekALAc_11 0 THEY'RE GREAT FOR TRYING ON COLOR
H9VekekALAc_12 0 LET'S SAY YOU WANT TO BE A RED HEAD FOR A FEW MONTHS YOU CAN DEPOSIT-ONLY YOUR COLOR JUST USE A DEPOSIT-ONLY RED AND IT WILL FADE OFF
H9VekekALAc_13 0 YOU DON'T GET THAT LINE OF DEMARKATION JUST LIKE A SEMI-PERMANENT
H9VekekALAc_14 0 HOWEVER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DEPOSIT-ONLY AND A SEMI-PERMANENT IS THAT A SEMI-PERMANENT MAY BLEND GREY WHERE AS THE DEPOSIT-ONLY IS NOT REALLY GOING TO BLEND GREY
H9VekekALAc_15 0 A DEPOSIT-ONLY WILL ALSO WORK WELL AS FAR AS MAINTAINING YOUR COLOR
H9VekekALAc_16 0 SO LET'S SAY YOU USE PERMANENT COLOR AND YOU WANT TO KICK UP THE INTENSITY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WITH RED HEADS OR IF YOU'RE A BLONDE WHO TENDS TO PULL GOLD OR WARM OR THAT BRASSIE COLOR THAT A LOT OF WOMEN SEE THEN YOU CAN GO TO THE STORE AND YOU CAN GET SOME OF THE DEPOSIT-ONLY GLAZES AND JUST APPLY THOSE
H9VekekALAc_17 0 USUALLY THEY'RE SHAMPOOED IN AND IT TAKES ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES TO APPLY LAST TWO OR THREE SHAMPOOS GAND THEY'RE GREAT GREAT FOR TONING GREAT FOR GLAZING AND GREAT FOR ADDING SHINE TO YOUR HAIR
GhHSnucJRrs_2 0 THE NEXT FUN STEP IS TO MAKE THE CENTER SHAFT FOR OUR LAMP
GhHSnucJRrs_3 0 WE'VE ALREADY GLUED UP THE PIECES FOR THE BASE AND WHILE THEY'RE DRYING WE'RE GOING TO CUT THE LUMBER TO MAKE THE TALL PIECE THAT GOES IN THE MIDDLE
GhHSnucJRrs_4 0 I FOUND A COUPLE OF PIECES HERE I REALLY LIKE AND THEY HAVE GREAT WEATHERING ON THEM AND THEY'RE REALLY APPEALING LOOKING
GhHSnucJRrs_5 0 SO I'M GOING TO USE THESE FOR THE LAMP THAT WE'RE MAKING TODAY
GhHSnucJRrs_6 0 THE FIRST THING THAT I'M GOING TO DO IS SQUARE OFF THE EDGES
GhHSnucJRrs_7 0 SO I'M GOING TO TAKE BOTH AND LAY THEM DOWN HERE ON THE TABLE SAW AND PUSH THEM RIGHT CLOSE UP NEXT TO THE FENCE
GhHSnucJRrs_8 0 AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THESE ARE PUSHED FIRMLY AGAINST THE FENCE
GhHSnucJRrs_9 0 REMEMBER THIS WOOD IS NOT STRAIGHT SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S AS STRAIGHT AS POSSIBLE WHEN YOU DO THIS CUT
GhHSnucJRrs_10 0 AND WE'LL HOLD THEM FIRMLY DOWN AND TRIM THE EDGE
GhHSnucJRrs_11 0 ALRIGHT STILL HOLDING BOTH PIECES TOGETHER WE'VE SELECTED OUR LENGTH FOR THIS PIECE TO BE EIGHTEEN INCHES
GhHSnucJRrs_12 0 AND I'VE ALREADY SET THE SAW UP WITH A SPOT DOWN HERE THAT'S EIGHTEEN INCHES FROM THIS SIDE OF THE BLADE
GhHSnucJRrs_13 0 I PUSH THE PIECES UP GET THEM AS SQUARE AGAINST THE FENCE AS I CAN
GhHSnucJRrs_14 0 AND I CUT THEM TO LENGTH
GhHSnucJRrs_15 0 THESE ARE THE PROPER LENGTH
GhHSnucJRrs_16 0 NOW THESE ARE TWO OTHER PIECES THAT I'VE ALREADY CUT THAT MAKE THE CENTER PART OF THIS SHAFT
GhHSnucJRrs_17 0 AND THEY'RE GOING TO GO ON HERE PRETTY MUCH LIKE THIS
GhHSnucJRrs_18 0 AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO NAIL THIS PIECE ON TOP
GhHSnucJRrs_19 0 SO BEFORE YOU CUT THESE THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS I WANT TO GO OVER ABOUT CUTTING THIS WOOD ON A TABLE SAW
GhHSnucJRrs_20 0 AND I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THAT IN A MINUTE
GAbc4MyyZyo_1 0 HI THIS IS ROBERT STEWART WITH HILL13.COM
GAbc4MyyZyo_2 0 NOW WHEN IT COMES TO MAINTENANCE THE VERY FIRST STEP IS USUALLY THE EASIEST STEP AND THAT IS THE BARREL
GAbc4MyyZyo_3 0 DEPENDING ON THE MAKE AND MODEL MOST BARRELS TODAY ARE THREADED BUT SOME BARRELS MAY ALSO BE ENCLOSED IN SOME SORT OF SHROUDING
GAbc4MyyZyo_4 0 OTHER BARRELS REQUIRE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT TEARDOWN SUCH AS THE FLATLINE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT MOUNTED IN EXACTLY THE SAME FASHION
GAbc4MyyZyo_5 0 BUT MOST OF THE TIME TURNING COUNTER-CLOCKWISE IS ALL IT WILL TAKE TO BRING THE BARREL OFF OF THE PAINTBALL GUN
GAbc4MyyZyo_6 0 NOW INSIDE YOU WILL SEE THAT THIS THIS IS A DIRTY GUN
GAbc4MyyZyo_7 0 THERE'S BEEN SOME PAINT BLOWN OUT THE LAST TIME IN THIS ONE THAT'S MIXED INTO THE OIL
GAbc4MyyZyo_8 0 ON ALMOST ALL PAINTBALL GUNS YOU'LL ALSO SEE THAT THEY HAVE AN O-RING HERE
GAbc4MyyZyo_9 0 YOU WANT TO CHECK THAT O-RING AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S IN GOOD SHAPE
GAbc4MyyZyo_10 0 IF IT LOOKS CRACKED OR DENTED OR HAS SOME SORT OF DINGS IN IT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO PULL THAT AND REPLACE IT
GAbc4MyyZyo_11 0 THE OTHER THING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO ESPECIALLY SUCH AS WITH THIS BARREL WHERE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN PAINT A BALL HAS BROKEN IN IT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU BRING ALL THAT DEBRIS OUT
GAbc4MyyZyo_12 0 NOW AT THIS POINT IF I WERE JUST GOING TO RUN BACK ON THE FIELD THIS BARREL IS GOOD TO GO AND THAT'S ALL YOU'D NEED TO DO
GAbc4MyyZyo_13 0 BUT IF I'M GOING TO SET IT UP AND CLEAN IT THEN I WANT TO ACTUALLY TAKE THIS AND WITH WARM SOAPY WATER PREFERABLY WITH THE O-RING OFF WASH THIS AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE PORTS ALONG THE BARREL SURFACE ARE CLEAN AND CLEAR OF PAINT DEBRIS
GAbc4MyyZyo_14 0 ONCE THAT IS COMPLETELY DRY WE'LL BE PUTTING THE O-RING BACK ON AND THEN IT'S READY TO ATTACH TO THE GUN WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED WITH YOUR MAINTENANCE
gkSGCbdgE7U_1 0 HI I'M BILL WITH ZOAR OUTDOOR HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM

gkSGCbdgE7U_7 0 A BACKPACK TO CARRY IT ALL IN A GUIDEBOOK IS HANDY TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE DOING AND WATER IS GOOD TO HAVE A LONG AND I ALWAYS LIKE TO HAVE A LEAST A FEW BAND-AIDS IN A BAG SO THOSE LITTLE SCRAPES AND THINGS AND BRUISES CAN BE TAKEN CARE OF WITHOUT TOO MUCH TROUBLE AT THE CLIFF
gkSGCbdgE7U_8 0 SO ALL THIS IS A LOT OF EQUIPMENT YOU DON'T NEED IT ALL TO GET STARTED BUT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU KNEW WHAT IT WAS AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DO NEED TO GET STARTED
GjoS1JCILBg_1 0 HI MY NAME IS ASHLEY LUDMAN FROM SEASIDE YOGA HERE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF PILATES
GjoS1JCILBg_2 0 PILATES IS AN EXERCISE PROGRAM THAT WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOP BY JOSEPH PILATES WITH THE CONCEPTS OF BREATHING CENTERING CONTROLLED MOVEMENT FLOWING FROM ONE POSTURE OR ONE EXERCISE TO THE NEXT
GjoS1JCILBg_3 0 THE BENEFITS OF PILATES ARE THEY RUN THE GAMUT
GjoS1JCILBg_4 0 I'VE EXPERIENCED BENEFITS OF MY OWN BODY OF INCREASE STRENGTH INCREASE POSTURE INCREASE AWARENESS OF HOW MY BODY MOVES AND ITS ABILITIES
GjoS1JCILBg_5 0 AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT PILATES WORK CREATES AN INCREASE STRENGTH THROUGH ECCENTRIC MUSCLE CONTRACTION WHICH MEANS THE MUSCLES ARE AT THEIR LONGEST FORM
GjoS1JCILBg_6 0 YOU'LL FIND THAT YOUR BODY WILL ACTUALLY CHANGE SHAPE
GjoS1JCILBg_7 0 YOU'LL FIND THAT YOUR MUSCLES WILL BECOME A LITTLE BIT LONGER
GjoS1JCILBg_8 0 YOUR BONE DENSITY IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN WILL ACTUALLY IMPROVE BECAUSE THIS IS CONSIDERED A WEIGHT BEARING EXERCISE
GjoS1JCILBg_9 0 I ALSO WORKED WITH MANY CLIENTS AND STUDENTS WHO FIND THAT BECAUSE OF THIS INCREASE STRENGTH AND THIS INCREASE FEELING OF WELL-BEING THERE CONFIDENCE IMPROVES THEIR DIGESTION IMPROVES THEIR INTERNAL ORGAN FUNCTIONS ALSO IMPROVE BECAUSE OF THIS ABILITY TO HOLD THEMSELVES OUT IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS THEIR POSTURE AND THEIR INCREASED ORGAN CAPACITY
GjoS1JCILBg_10 0 SO THAT'S ARE JUST SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF PILATES AND I HOPE YOU FIND MORE FOR YOURSELF
HhWkohEcvlI_1 0 AUSTIN MCBRIDE HI I'M AUSTIN MCBRIDE HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
HhWkohEcvlI_2 0 TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO BOUNCE A GOLF BALL ON THE FLAT SURFACE OF A GOLF CLUB
HhWkohEcvlI_3 0 THIS WAS A TRICK POPULARIZED BY A 1999 NIKE TELEVISION COMMERCIAL WITH TIGER WOODS WHERE HE WAS BOUNCING IT OVER AND OVER POPS IT UP AND CRACKS INTO THE DRIVING RANGE
HhWkohEcvlI_4 0 THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN LEARNING THAT LITTLE TRICK
HhWkohEcvlI_5 0 SO PUT THE BALL ON THE GROUND ROLL IT UP TO THE CLUB PUSH IT ONTO THE CLUB AND IN ONE SWIFT MOTION WE'RE GOING TO LIFT AND THEN LOWER THE CLUB
HhWkohEcvlI_6 0 SO JUST LIFTING THE BALL UP IN THE AIR POPPING IT UP AND IT PRETTY MUCH ALLOWS US TO BE BOUNCING IT AFTER THAT
HhWkohEcvlI_7 0 SO I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW THAT ONE MORE TIME
HhWkohEcvlI_8 0 JUST POPPING IT IN THE AIR JUST LIKE THAT
HhWkohEcvlI_9 0 ONCE THE BALL IS IN THE AIR WE'RE GOING TO REPEAT THAT MOTION OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND JUST POPPING IT UP AND WATCHING IT AS IT COMES DOWN
HhWkohEcvlI_10 0 IT WILL DEFINITELY REACT DIFFERENTLY AS IT'S HITTING DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CLUB RIGHT IN THE CENTER SPOT OR A SWEET SPOT
HhWkohEcvlI_11 0 IT WILL POP WAY UP IN THE AIR AND AS IT HITS OTHER PARTS OF THE CLUB IT MIGHT NOT BOUNCE UP AS HIGH BUT YOU CAN DEFINITELY GAIN A FEEL OF HOW HIGH IT'S GOING TO BE BOUNCING AND KIND OF WHAT DIRECTION IT'S GOING TO BE GOING BY WHERE IT HITS ON THE FACE OF THE CLUB
GnVjTbHu21Q_1 0 A LAT PULL OR HORIZONTAL ADDUCTION IS GOOD FOR WORKING THAT INTO THAT V SHAPE A BIG MUSCLE THAT SPANS OUT THROUGH THE BACK ATTACHES AROUND INTO THE FRONT OF THE SHOULDER
GnVjTbHu21Q_2 0 YOU WANT TO LINE UP YOUR WRIST ELBOW AND SHOULDER SO YOU NO NEED TO REALLY COME OUT HERE WIDE BECAUSE JOINTS ARE GOING TO DICTATE THAT THAT MUSCLE BEND SHUTS OFF
GnVjTbHu21Q_3 0 SO IF YOU LINE UP YOUR JOINTS YOU'RE GOING TO GET FULL ENGAGEMENT AND RECRUITMENT OF THE LATS
GnVjTbHu21Q_4 0 COME DOWN HERE WITH YOUR KNEES ALIGN WITH THE HIPS FEET HIP WIDTH APART AND YOU WANT TO THINK OF BRINGING YOUR SHOULDER BLADES TOGETHER AND A SLIGHT LIFT IN THE CHEST BEFORE YOU EVEN INITIATE THE MOVEMENT
GnVjTbHu21Q_5 0 AND BIG INHALE EXHALE AND JUST PULLING THE BAR DOWN BOOM RIGHT THERE IS A GOOD STOPPING POINT
GnVjTbHu21Q_6 0 ANY FURTHER THAN THAT I'M NOT REALLY USING LATS AND YOU'RE LETTING THE LOWER BACK COME IN TO PLAY AND RELEASE
GnVjTbHu21Q_7 0 SO INHALE AND WE CONTRACT DOWN JUST TO THAT CHEST BONE AND RELEASE WITH A SLIGHT BEND IN THE ELBOW
GnVjTbHu21Q_8 0 SO YOU'RE KEEPING THAT MUSCLE ON A CONSTANT CONTRACTION BY KEEPING A SLIGHT BEND IN THE ELBOW AND BRINGING IT JUST TO THE CHEST AND NO LOWER CAUSE AFTER THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SHUT THE LATS OFF
GnVjTbHu21Q_9 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU WORK IN A GOOD TEN TO FIFTEEN REP RANGE ONE TO THREE SETS
hhjISQhs4NY_1 0 HI THIS IS YOLANDA VANVEEN FROM VANVEENBULBS.COM
hhjISQhs4NY_2 0 NEXT WE ARE GOING TO WANT TO LEARN ALL ABOUT HOW TO GROW HOSTAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHADE PLANTS
hhjISQhs4NY_3 0 HOSTAS ARE A BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL SHADE PLANT BECAUSE THEY'LL GROW SO BEAUTIFULLY IN THE SHADE
hhjISQhs4NY_4 0 MY TRICK IS THEY CAN'T HANDLE TOO MUCH SHADE EITHER SO IF YOU HAVE AN AREA WHERE WEEDS WON'T GROW AND THERE IS ONLY MOSS AND PINE NEEDLES DON'T EVEN TRY TO GROW HOSTA
hhjISQhs4NY_5 0 BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF A SHADY AREA WHERE WEEDS ARE COMING UP OR BULBS ARE COMING UP OR YOU HAVE ANY OTHER FERNS GROWING THEN HOSTAS WILL GROW REALLY WELL THERE AND THEY'RE JUST EASY TO GROW
hhjISQhs4NY_6 0 THEY ARE JUST A ROOT WITH A LOT OF LEAVES AND THEY MULTIPLY QUICKLY SO HOSTAS ARE REALLY EASY TO GROW
hhjISQhs4NY_7 0 BASICALLY THEY COME AS A ROOT WITH PART OF A STEM AND WHEN YOU DIVIDE THEM OUT THAT IS ALL YOU NEED IS PART OF A ROOT WITH THE STEM AND SO YOU JUST PLANT IT ABOUT THREE INCHES DEEP SO THE STEM IS BARELY OUT OF THE GROUND
hhjISQhs4NY_8 0 PUT IT IN A SHADY SPOT AND IT WILL DO REALLY WELL
hhjISQhs4NY_9 0 GIVE IT LOTS OF WATER TO START
hhjISQhs4NY_10 0 THEY REALLY WANT TO DRINK SOME WATER
hhjISQhs4NY_11 0 THEY DON'T WANT TO DRY OUT TO THE BONE BECAUSE IF IT IS JUST REALLY REALLY DRY SOMETIMES YOU'LL LOSE THEM BUT I HAVE HAD SOME OF THEM JUST DIE BACK BECAUSE YOU HAVE QUIT WATERING THEM AND IT IS MAYBE TOO MUCH SUN AND THEN WHEN IT RAINS IN THE FALL THEY COME RIGHT BACK UP
hhjISQhs4NY_12 0 SO WITH THAT SAID THEY ARE AN EASY PLANT YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH GROW THEM ANYWHERE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST
hhjISQhs4NY_13 0 I HAVE PUT THEM IN THE HOT SUN AND THEY HAVE THRIVED THERE AS WELL BECAUSE THEY WERE NEAR RHODODENDRON AND GOT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SHADE
hhjISQhs4NY_14 0 SO TEST THEM OUT YOU CAN GROW THEM ALMOST ANYWHERE
hhjISQhs4NY_15 0 GOOD COMPOSTED SOIL OR GOOD POTTING SOIL IS THE BEST MIX FOR THEM
hhjISQhs4NY_16 0 THEY LOVE RAISED BEDS BUT THEY'LL DO GREAT UNDERNEATH TREES
hhjISQhs4NY_17 0 ONE THING I'VE KNOWN ABOUT THE HOSTAS TOO BECAUSE THEY ARE USUALLY IN THE SHADE IS IN THE SUMMER TIME WHEN MY TREES ARE REALLY FULL OF LEAVES I HAVE TO WATER THEM PRETTY WELL BUT IN THE WINTER TIME WHEN THEY LOSE THEIR LEAVES THEY PRETTY MUCH GET WATERED ON THEIR OWN SO THERE IS KIND OF TIMES IN THE SPRING AND THE FALL WHERE YOU DO HAVE TO WATCH EVEN IF IT IS RAINING OUTSIDE THAT YOU DO GIVE THEM SOME WATER BECAUSE THEY WILL STILL DRY OUT IF THEY ARE GETTING ANY WATER AND YOU'LL LOSE THEM EVEN IN THE SPRING OR THE FALL
hhjISQhs4NY_18 0 ONCE THEY ARE ESTABLISHED YOU'LL NEVER LOSE THEM AND YOU'LL HAVE THEM FOR YEARS AND YEARS
gmAQ34kpTsQ_1 0 WHAT I CAN SHOW YOU NEXT IS HOW TO TRANSPOSE DIFFERENT MIDI DATA YOU MIGHT HAVE RECORDED
gmAQ34kpTsQ_2 0 RIGHT NOW ON MY SCREEN I HAVE A PIANO PART THAT I'VE ALREADY RECORDED
gmAQ34kpTsQ_3 0 NOW WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO TAKE THIS PIANO PART AND KIND OF MAYBE TRANSPOSE IT DOWN ONE OR BRING IT UP TWO STEP OR WHATEVER
gmAQ34kpTsQ_4 0 SO WHAT I CAN DO IS I GO INTO MY MIDI SELECTION AT THE VERY TOP AND MAKE SURE I CHOOSE MY TRANSPOSE
gmAQ34kpTsQ_5 0 ONCE MY TRANSPOSE IS SELECTED AND MY SELECTION AND MY DATA IS HIGHLIGHTED I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRANSPOSE IT BY AS MANY SEMI-TONES OR BY THE NOTES I WANT
gmAQ34kpTsQ_6 0 SO WHAT I CAN DO IS MAYBE I'LL BRING IT UP FIVE
gmAQ34kpTsQ_7 0 SO I'LL APPLY IT AND I'LL PRESS PLAY
gmAQ34kpTsQ_8 0 SO IT'S PRETTY EASY TO BE ABLE TO TRANSPOSE IT FROM WHERE IT ORIGINALLY WAS
gmAQ34kpTsQ_9 0 WHAT I CAN ALSO DO IS DO IT BY THE NOTES
gmAQ34kpTsQ_10 0 SO IF I HAVE A CERTAIN NOTE I CAN BRING IT DOWN TO A CERTAIN NOTE DO DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT
GRiR2nV8a0M_1 0 SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET READY TO DO THE FINGER STICK THAT ACTUALLY IS GOING TO PRODUCE THE SAMPLE WE'LL BE COLLECTING
GRiR2nV8a0M_2 0 THIS SEEMS TO BE THE MOST INTIMIDATING PART OF SOME HOME TESTING KITS FOR PEOPLE
GRiR2nV8a0M_3 0 IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HIV IF THAT'S YOUR IMPETUS FOR TAKING THE TEST
GRiR2nV8a0M_4 0 BUT SOMETHING ABOUT TAKING A TINY NEEDLE AND JABBING IT INTO THE SIDE OF YOUR FINGER TO DRAW BLOOD REALLY IS OFF PUTTING TO PEOPLE
GRiR2nV8a0M_5 0 SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE ON HOW TO MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER ON YOURSELF
GRiR2nV8a0M_6 0 SOME OF THE SAME ADVICE YOU'LL FIND IN THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE TESTING KIT
GRiR2nV8a0M_7 0 AND AGAIN I RECOMMEND YOU READ THROUGH THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE TEST KIT THOROUGHLY BEFORE YOU ATTEMPT TO COLLECT A SAMPLE
GRiR2nV8a0M_8 0 THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO WHEN SELECTING IS TO PICK YOUR OFF HAND OF COURSE
GRiR2nV8a0M_9 0 YOU'LL NEED YOUR DOMINANT HAND TO USE THE LANCET AND THE EQUIPMENT TO COLLECT THE BLOOD
GRiR2nV8a0M_10 0 AND THE DRAW AREA WE'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON IS ON EITHER YOUR MIDDLE OR RING FINGER TO THE SIDES OF THE PAD OF THE FINGER
GRiR2nV8a0M_11 0 YOU COULD USE YOUR FIRST FINGER BUT IT'S GENERALLY THE MOST CALLOUSED OF ALL YOUR FINGERS
GRiR2nV8a0M_12 0 AND CALLOUSES AREN'T PLACES WHERE BLOOD FLOWS
GRiR2nV8a0M_13 0 SO THERE'S NO POINT IN POKING A CALLOUS AND TRYING TO DRAW BLOOD
GRiR2nV8a0M_14 0 ONCE YOU'VE SELECTED YOUR SITE YOU SHOULD GO WASH AND DRY YOUR HANDS THOROUGHLY
GRiR2nV8a0M_15 0 NOT ONLY DOES THIS ENSURE THAT BOTH THE HANDS YOU'LL BE USING ARE CLEAN THE ACTION OF WASHING YOUR HANDS IN THE WARM WATER WILL STIMULATE THE BLOOD FLOW TO YOUR HANDS PRODUCING A BETTER SAMPLE
GRiR2nV8a0M_16 0 ONCE YOU'VE DECIDED WHERE YOU WANT TO STICK GO AHEAD AND GET YOUR SAMPLE CARD OPEN AND HAVE THAT READY TO DROP THE BLOOD ON
GRiR2nV8a0M_17 0 OPEN UP THE ALCOHOL PREP AND WIPE THE AREA YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING THE LANCET ON
GRiR2nV8a0M_18 0 AND TAKE A DEEP BREATH
GRiR2nV8a0M_19 0 GET THE LANCET READY TO GO AND JUST POP YOURSELF
GRiR2nV8a0M_20 0 IT'S REALLY REALLY SIMPLE
GRiR2nV8a0M_21 0 IT'S NOT AT ALL SCARY
GRiR2nV8a0M_22 0 YOU'VE PROBABLY HAD IT DONE AT YOUR DOCTORS OFFICE MORE TIMES THAN YOU CAN REMEMBER
h72HD8ocVEM_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT USING COLOR IN ARCHITECTURAL PHOTOGRAPHY
h72HD8ocVEM_2 0 NOW DOWN HERE IN MIAMI THERE ARE MANY BUILDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN USED WITH A GREAT AMOUNT OF COLOR
h72HD8ocVEM_3 0 AND THIS IS THE ATLANTIS CONDOMINIUM YOU MAY HAVE SEEN IT ON THE FRONT CREDITS OF MIAMI VICE BACK IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES
h72HD8ocVEM_4 0 AND IT'S DESIGNED BY WORLD CLASS ARCHITECTS ARCHITECT TONICA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
h72HD8ocVEM_5 0 AND THEY ARE VERY WELL KNOWN FOR THEIR AMAZING USE OF COLOR IN THEIR BUILDINGS
h72HD8ocVEM_6 0 SO LOOK HERE WE'VE GOT AN AMAZING COBALT BLUE SKY BRIGHT RED BALCONY YELLOW WALL AND A BLUE JACUZZI WITH THE GREEN IN THE BACKGROUND
h72HD8ocVEM_7 0 ALL THESE BRIGHT PRIMARY COLORS MAKE FOR A VERY INTERESTING COMPOSITION
h72HD8ocVEM_8 0 AND YOU CAN USE COLOR TO ANIMATE YOUR PHOTOGRAPHS TO A REMARKABLE DEGREE
h72HD8ocVEM_9 0 WHILST AT THE SAME TIME REMEMBERING THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT NOT IN ARCHITECTURAL PHOTOGRAPHY TO KEEP YOUR LINES STRAIGHT WITH THE SIDES OF THE PICTURE BECAUSE THAT IS THE WAY THE ARCHITECT INTENDED IT TO SEE
h72HD8ocVEM_10 0 DON'T LEAN BACK DON'T LEAN FORWARD
h72HD8ocVEM_11 0 PUT YOUR CAMERA ON A TRIPOD AND SHOOT STRAIGHT AS YOU CAN
h72HD8ocVEM_12 0 IF AT ANY TIME YOU CAN USE A TILT SHIFT LENS LIKE THIS THE TWENTY FOUR MILLIMETER THAT'S GOING TO HELP A LOT WITH YOUR ARCHITECTURAL PHOTOGRAPHY
h72HD8ocVEM_13 0 THE OTHER WAY OF DOING IT IS USING PHOTOSHOP
h72HD8ocVEM_14 0 BUT THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO GO
G6_EhinHPow_1 0 HI I'M KAREN FOR EXPERT VILLAGE NOW WE'LL BE MAKING TRADITIONAL MATZAH BALLS THESE ARE THE INGREDIENTS WE'LL BE USING
G6_EhinHPow_2 0 NOW WE'LL PUT TOGETHER THE WET INGREDIENTS FOR OUR MATZAH BALLS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE MAKING MATZAH BALLS CAME OUT MORE LIKE ROCKS THAN THOSE FLUFFY MATZAH BALLS YOU FINE IN THE DELICATESSEN
G6_EhinHPow_3 0 BUT I LEARNED SOME TRICKS OVER THE YEARS TO MAKE SOME NICE FLUFFY ONES OF MY OWN THE TRICK IS INCORPORATE AIR INTO THE WET INGREDIENTS THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS USING A BLENDER OR A REGULAR BLENDER OR A HAND BLENDER
G6_EhinHPow_4 0 LET'S DO IT FIRST WE'RE GOING TO CRACK OUR EGGS INTO A SEPARATE CONTAINER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY SHELLS LIKE THAT THAT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD
G6_EhinHPow_5 0 AND THEN PUT THAT RIGHT INTO THE BLENDER THAT'S FOUR EGGS NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD A 1/4 CUP OF WATER OUR 1/4 CUP OF OIL THE TRADITIONAL OIL TO USE WOULD BE SHMALTS SHMALTS IS A RENDER CHICKEN FAT IT'S NOT SO HEALTHY SO I LIKE TO USE A MIXTURE OF OLIVE OIL AND CANOLA OIL IT'S TWO TABLESPOONS OF OLIVE OIL AND TWO TABLESPOONS OF CANOLA OIL
G6_EhinHPow_6 0 I JUST ADDED A PINCH OF WHITE PEPPER AND TWO TEASPOONS OF SALT NOW I'M GOING TO BLEND THAT UP UNTIL IT'S LIGHT AND AIRY
HGPmRBqHS0k_1 0 THE NEXT STEP IN MAKING A CORSAGE IS TO COME UP WITH THE TOOLS THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO MAKE THE CORSAGE
HGPmRBqHS0k_2 0 THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO COME UP WITH IS A WRISTLET
HGPmRBqHS0k_3 0 THEY COME IN DIFFERENT SIZES SHAPES KINDS AND COLORS
HGPmRBqHS0k_4 0 THIS ONE HAPPENS TO BE ONE THAT IS MADE OUT OF PEARL AND ELASTIC
HGPmRBqHS0k_5 0 BECAUSE WE ARE DOING SOMETHING FOR A YOUNG GIRL HER ARM IS THINNER SO THIS WOULD BE ABLE TO TUCK ON HER BETTER
HGPmRBqHS0k_6 0 THEY ALSO HAVE THEM WHERE THERE IS VELCRO AROUND THE ENDS SO THAT YOU COULD PUT THEM ON THE WRIST OR UP ON THE ARM AS WELL
HGPmRBqHS0k_7 0 YOU ARE GOING TO NEED WIRE CUTTERS TO CUT THE FLOWERS THEMSELVES
HGPmRBqHS0k_8 0 YOU COULD EITHER USE THIS TYPE HERE OR A NEEDLE NOSE
HGPmRBqHS0k_9 0 YOU WILL ALSO NEED TO HAVE SOME SCISSORS SO THAT YOU CAN CUT THE RIBBON THAT YOU ARE GOING TO PUT INT HE CORSAGE AND YOU ARE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE A OLD TOOTHBRUSH OR SOMETHING TO TAKE THOSE GLUE STRINGS OFF
HGPmRBqHS0k_10 0 THE OTHER THING YOU WOULD NEED AND IS VERY IMPORTANT IS THE FLORAL TAPE WHICH IS A TAPE THAT YOU CAN BUY AT ANY CRAFT STORE AND ALL IT WORKS IS JUST GIVING IT A LITTLE TUG AND IT HOLDS ALL YOUR CONSTRUCTION AND YOUR FLOWERS TOGETHER AS YOU ARE WORKING WITH IT
HGPmRBqHS0k_11 0 SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS COME UP WITH THESE TOOLS AS WELL AS A WRISTLET FOR YOUR CORSAGE AND YOU ARE SET AND READY TO GO
hivena9srJE_1 0 HI EVERYBODY I'M JOHN GRADEN FROM THE MARTIAL ARTS TEACHER'S ASSOCIATION AND TODAY'S LESSON IS REALLY IMPORTANT
hivena9srJE_2 0 THIS IS CALLED PENETRATING FOOTWORK
hivena9srJE_3 0 WHAT DO I MEAN BY PENETRATING FOOTWORK
hivena9srJE_4 0 LET'S TAKE A LOOK
hivena9srJE_5 0 JOINING ME FROM PRO STAR MIXED MARTIAL ARTS IS MR JOE BRIGNOLI
hivena9srJE_6 0 WE KNOW THAT WE WANT TO CONTROL THE SET POINT
hivena9srJE_7 0 THE SET POINT IS THAT POSITION TO WHERE I'M JUST OUT OF DISTANCE BUT I CAN STEP IN AND FIRE ON HIM AND HE CAN STEP IN AND FIRE ON ME
hivena9srJE_8 0 WE WANT TO CONTROL THE SET POINT SO IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE IN ATTACKING HERE WE HAVE TO HAVE A PENETRATING FOOTWORK SO FOR EVERY ATTACKING TECHNIQUE YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS THE FOOTWORK
hivena9srJE_9 0 HOW DO I ATTACK WITH THIS EFFICIENTLY
hivena9srJE_10 0 FOR INSTANCE IF IT IS THE FRONT HAND JAB IT WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE FOR ME TO MOVE THIS FOOT AND THEN STEP IN AND JAB BECAUSE AS SOON AS THIS FOOT MOVES HE SENSES THE ATTACK
hivena9srJE_11 0 HE IS JUST GOING TO MOVE AWAY OR HE IS GOING TO MEET ME HALF WAY AND FIRE SO A SMARTER PENETRATING FOOTWORK WOULD BE THE STEP DRAG WHERE I TAKE THIS FOOT POINT THE TOES RIGHT DOWN THE CENTER OF HIM PUSH HARD OFF THIS BACK LEG BANG AND STEP RIGHT IN THERE AND EXPLODE ACROSS THAT LINE AND PENETRATE HIS DEFENSIVE PERIMETER PENETRATE HIS DEFENSE
hivena9srJE_12 0 SO I WANT TO KNOW ON EVERY TECHNIQUE AND PRACTICE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN POW THAT INITIAL MOVEMENT IF THERE IS GOING TO BE A KICK WHAT IS THE PENETRATING FOOTWORK
hivena9srJE_13 0 SO I'M ALWAYS FOCUSED ON PENETRATING FOOTWORK
hivena9srJE_14 0 THANK YOU MR BRIGNOLI
hivena9srJE_15 0 PENETRATING FOOTWORK IS ALSO KNOWN AS THE INITIAL MOTION AND THE INITIAL MOVE ON ANY ATTACK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
hivena9srJE_16 0 I'M JOHN GRADEN
hivena9srJE_17 0 FOR MORE INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT ME AT JOHNGRADEN.COM
hcqybw2ISH4_1 0 ALRIGHT SO WE WENT OVER SOME REALLY BASIC BASIC BASIC THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT SAFETY BEFORE YOU START PRACTICING STAGE COMBAT
hcqybw2ISH4_2 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO SAFETY BETWEEN THE IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO BE THE ATTACKER AND SHAUN MY ASSISTANT HERE HE'S GOING TO BE THE ATTACKEE
hcqybw2ISH4_3 0 NOW TWO BASIC THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE YOU START TO DO ANY KIND OF PUNCHING OR SLAPPING MOVE ARE ESTABLISHING DISTANCE AND ESTABLISHING EYE CONTACT BETWEEN THE PERSON YOU'RE ACTING WITH
hcqybw2ISH4_4 0 SO IF I WAS GOING TO GO UP AND I WANTED TO SLAP SHAUN IN THE FACE WHICH WE'LL BE LEARNING IN JUST A SECOND AFTER WE LEARN NAPS IS I WANT TO ESTABLISH A SAFE DISTANCE BETWEEN ME AND SHAUN
hcqybw2ISH4_5 0 SO WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP LIKE IF I WAS GOING TO WALK UP TO SHAUN AND BE LIKE HEY I'M GOING TO SLAP YOU IN THE FACE SHAUN
hcqybw2ISH4_6 0 I WOULD GO UP AND I WOULD PUT MY HANDS ON HIS SHOULDERS JUST LIKE THAT TO ESTABLISH A SAFE DISTANCE
hcqybw2ISH4_7 0 THAT WAY I'M NOT TOO CLOSE OR I'M NOT TOO FAR AWAY SO THAT IT DOESN'T LOOK REAL
hcqybw2ISH4_8 0 THE NEXT THING YOU'RE GOING TO DO AFTER YOU'VE ESTABLISHED A SAFE DISTANCE IS YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE EYE CONTACT
hcqybw2ISH4_9 0 THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S THE CUE BETWEEN YOU AND THE OTHER ACTOR THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH
hcqybw2ISH4_10 0 IT'S THE CUE TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO AND AGAIN YOU GUYS SHOULD BOTH KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU'RE GOING TO DO
hcqybw2ISH4_11 0 NEVER DO THIS NOT KNOWING IT'S GOING TO BE VERY UNSAFE AND SOMEONE'S GOING TO GET HURT
hcqybw2ISH4_12 0 SO THOSE ARE THE TWO BASIC THINGS TO KNOW OF THE ESTABLISHING DISTANCE AND THE CUE BETWEEN THE TWO ACTORS THAT LET YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE READY TO START PUNCHING AND SLAPPING
gNmCeE_tT48_1 0 THERE IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GAMES
gNmCeE_tT48_2 0 HENCE ONE GAME IS A VARIATION THE MOST POPULAR FORM OF THE GAME THAT IS PLAYED TODAY AND WE'LL BE COMING TO THAT IN THE NEXT SESSION IS CALLED BID WHIST WITH KIDDIE
gNmCeE_tT48_3 0 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRAIGHT WHIST AND BID WHIST IS THAT IN STRAIGHT WHIST THERE ARE NO JOKERS YOU DO NOT USE JOKERS IN STRAIGHT WHIST
gNmCeE_tT48_4 0 NUMBER TWO WE DO NOT HAVE A KIDDIE
gNmCeE_tT48_5 0 A KIDDIE VERY SIMILAR TO EUCHRE IS LIKE A DISCARD PILE
gNmCeE_tT48_6 0 FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WERE DEALING OUT THE CARDS LET'S JUST DEAL THEM OUT REAL QUICK THERE WOULD BE A POINT IN TIME THAT YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE FOUR CARDS IN THE KIDDIE PLUS THE JOKERS THAT'S THE KIDDIE
gNmCeE_tT48_7 0 STRAIGHT WHIST WE DEAL OUT ALL THE CARDS
gNmCeE_tT48_8 0 EVERYBODY STARTS OUT WITH THIRTEEN CARDS
gNmCeE_tT48_9 0 SO THAT IS THE BASIC DIFFERENCE
gNmCeE_tT48_10 0 OTHERWISE THE TERMS UPTOWN AND DOWNTOWN WILL COME INTO THE PLAY
gNmCeE_tT48_11 0 THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GAMES STRAIGHT WHIST ALL CARDS ARE DEALT ALL CARDS ARE IN PLAY IN BID WHIST KIDDIE WHIST SIX CARDS INCLUDING THE JOKERS ARE IN A KIDDIE SO YOU HAVE A MUCH MORE LIVELY AND COMPETITIVE AUCTION
gx9PCtLxGSs_1 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO PICK OUT AND PLANT A FRESH EGGPLANT
gx9PCtLxGSs_2 0 WHEN YOU'RE PICKING OUT A FOUR PACK LIKE THIS YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S ONE IN EACH LITTLE FOUR PACK
gx9PCtLxGSs_3 0 MAKE SURE IT LOOKS PRETTY DECENT LIKE THIS GREEN ONE HERE
gx9PCtLxGSs_4 0 DON'T PICK ANYTHING THAT MAY HAVE LIKE A DISEASE ON IT OR MAYBE LIKE A LITTLE BAD SPOT LIKE THAT ON IT
gx9PCtLxGSs_5 0 TRY AND STAY AWAY FROM THAT
gx9PCtLxGSs_6 0 THAT'S NOT TOO BAD BUT YOU JUST WANT TO STAY AWAY FROM ANYTHING LIKE THAT
gx9PCtLxGSs_7 0 TAKE A LOOK AT THE TAG
gx9PCtLxGSs_8 0 THEY ALL SAY HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR THEM TO MATURE AND WHETHER TO PLANT THEM IN FULL SUN
gx9PCtLxGSs_9 0 THIS PARTICULAR ONE YOU NEED TO PLANT IN FULL SUN AND IT TAKES ABOUT EIGHTY DAYS TO MATURE
gx9PCtLxGSs_10 0 SO YOU WANT TO GIVE YOURSELF ENOUGH TIME TO LET THOSE MATURE
gx9PCtLxGSs_11 0 PLANT THEM A LITTLE BIT EARLY IN THE SEASON BECAUSE IT TAKES EIGHTY DAYS
gx9PCtLxGSs_12 0 TAKE A LOOK AT THE SPACING SO THEY HAVE ENOUGH ROOM TO GROW
gx9PCtLxGSs_13 0 THIS ONE SAYS ABOUT THIRTY TO THIRTY SIX INCHES APART
gx9PCtLxGSs_14 0 SO YOU WANT TO PLANT THEM ABOUT TWO TO THREE FEET APART IN FULL SUN
gx9PCtLxGSs_15 0 YOU WANT TO NOT PLANT THEM IN ANY KIND OF BAD SOIL
gx9PCtLxGSs_16 0 YOU WANT TO USE SOME KIND OF GARDEN SOIL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
gx9PCtLxGSs_17 0 AT THIS GARDEN CENTER WE RECOMMEND YOU USE OUR MIRACLE-GRO GARDEN SOIL
gx9PCtLxGSs_18 0 IT'S GOT FERTILIZER RIGHT IN IT
gx9PCtLxGSs_19 0 IT'S GOOD BLACK DIRT
GY_XmNhupPo_1 0 KNOWING HOW TO CHANGE A TIRE IS A PRETTY USEFUL TRICK AND TIP WHEN IT COMES TO BEING A MOUNTAIN BIKER BECAUSE CHANGING TIRE FOR PREFERENCE IS THE SAME FOR CHANGING TIRES WHEN YOU GET A FLAT
GY_XmNhupPo_2 0 SO IT ALWAYS GOOD TO BE PREPARE AND KNOW HOW TO DO THIS
GY_XmNhupPo_3 0 WITH THIS SPECIFIC TIRE AND WHEEL COMBINATION WE SEE WE HAVE WHAT IS CALLED A PRESS VALVE IT IS A THINNER VALVE THEN WHAT YOU WOULD FIND IN A CAR AND INSTEAD OF HAVING A VALVE CAP TO HAVE IT CLOSE THERE IS A LITTLE THREADED NUT WHICH AS YOU CAN SEE THE VALVE IS CLOSE I PUSH DOWN ON IT NO AIR COMES OUT
GY_XmNhupPo_4 0 NOW I OPEN THE VALVE AND I PUSH DOWN ON IT AIR COMES OUT SO I'M GOING TO LET ALL THE AIR OUT
GY_XmNhupPo_5 0 IT TAKES WHILE SOMETIMES IT HELPS IF I PUSH DOWN ON THE TIRE A LET THE AIR COME OUT A LITTLE QUICKER
GY_XmNhupPo_6 0 YOU CAN HEAR IT COMING OUT IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE PRETTY GOOD

H0o-9qGWkz0_9 0 IN THE BEGINNING YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO LOW AS A STARTING POSITION AS YOU INCREASE THIS EXERCISE YOU WANT TO BEGIN STARTING MAYBE ABOUT ONE TO TWO MINUTES HOLDING AND YOU WANT TO WORK YOUR WAY UP ANYWHERE TO FIVE TO TEN MINUTES
H0o-9qGWkz0_10 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR BREATHING IS DONE NATURALLY AND RELAXED AND THIS IS CALLED EMBRACE THE MOON CHI GONG

gXMK4dZaXD8_1 0 HI I'M JESSICA CAIN WITH EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
gXMK4dZaXD8_2 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO CREATE FUN CHRISTMAS PARTY GAMES WITH THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY TO USE WRAP YOUR PRESENTS AND GET READY FOR CHRISTMAS
gXMK4dZaXD8_3 0 SO ONCE YOU ARE AT YOUR CHRISTMAS PARTY THE RULES OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT GAMES ARE TO HAVE A NUMBER
gXMK4dZaXD8_4 0 SAY YOU HAVE TWENTY GUEST YOU WOULD WANT TO NUMBER ONE TWENTY ON A PIECE OF PAPER
gXMK4dZaXD8_5 0 CUT THEM UP INDIVIDUALLY AND LET EVERYONE DRAW A NUMBER OUT OF A FUN
gXMK4dZaXD8_6 0 A LITTLE HAT THAT IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING THEY CAN DRAW RIGHT OUT OF THE HAT
gXMK4dZaXD8_7 0 YOU WANT TO KEEP IT AS CHRISTMAS AS YOU CAN
gXMK4dZaXD8_8 0 SO ONCE EVERYONE HAS A NUMBER THEN THE PERSON WHO DRAWS NUMBER ONE WOULD GO UP THE CHRISTMAS PILE WITH ALL THE GIFTS
gXMK4dZaXD8_9 0 EVERYONE WOULD PUT ALL OF THEIR GIFT IN ONE SPOT AND NUMBER WOULD GO UP AND CHOOSE A GIFT HE AND SHE WOULD THEN OPEN IT IMMEDIATELY
gXMK4dZaXD8_10 0 SO THEN EVERYONE IN THE CIRCLE SEES WHAT NUMBER ONE HAS
gXMK4dZaXD8_11 0 AT THE POINT NUMBER TWO HAS THE OPTION TO TAKE NUMBER GIFTS OR GO BACK TO THE PILE AND OPEN A NEW ONE
HCOSJmjHxe4_1 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BEARINGS
HCOSJmjHxe4_2 0 BEARINGS ARE WHAT GO INSIDE THE WHEELS AND SIT ON THE AXLE OF TRUCKS TO KEEP YOUR BOARD SPINNING
HCOSJmjHxe4_3 0 BEARINGS RANGE FROM PRICES
HCOSJmjHxe4_4 0 I MEAN ACTIVE WE HAVE BEARINGS THAT ARE AS CHEAP AS TEN DOLLARS AND AS EXPENSIVE AS FIFTY DOLLARS
HCOSJmjHxe4_5 0 THERE'S A SYSTEM THAT BEARINGS RUN ON
HCOSJmjHxe4_6 0 THERE'S THE ABEC SYSTEM A SWISS SYSTEM OR A CERAMIC SYSTEM
HCOSJmjHxe4_7 0 AND HERE WE HAVE ABEC THREE NINJA BEARINGS
HCOSJmjHxe4_8 0 THESE ARE GOOD BEARINGS BUT AS THEY GET AS THE NUMBER GETS HIGHER
HCOSJmjHxe4_9 0 THE BEARINGS SHOULD BE FASTER AND SMOOTHER
HCOSJmjHxe4_10 0 THESE ARE ACTIVE SPINNERS
HCOSJmjHxe4_11 0 THEY ARE ABEC FIVE BEARING
HCOSJmjHxe4_12 0 THESE ARE FKD ABEC SEVEN
HCOSJmjHxe4_13 0 AND THESE ARE ENDORSED BY PAUL REGIS
HCOSJmjHxe4_14 0 AND HE'S AN ACTIVE TEAM RIDER
HCOSJmjHxe4_15 0 AND THESE ARE CHOCOLATE SWISS BEARINGS
HCOSJmjHxe4_16 0 THESE RUN ON A SWISS PRECISION AND NORMALLY THE SMOOTHEST AND THE FASTEST BEARINGS ON THE MARKET
HCOSJmjHxe4_17 0 OUR MOST POPULAR BEARINGS WOULD BE THE BONES RED
HCOSJmjHxe4_18 0 I ACTUALLY SKATE THE BONES RED
HCOSJmjHxe4_19 0 THEY'RE PRETTY DURABLE THEY'RE EASY TO CLEAN AND STUFF
HCOSJmjHxe4_20 0 AND FAST AND SMOOTH
HCOSJmjHxe4_21 0 AND EVERYONE SEEMS TO LIKE THEM
h8ZC9z944cU_1 0 THE CUTTER'S THROWN WITH TWO SEAMS
h8ZC9z944cU_2 0 IT'S MUCH THE SAME AS A TWO SEAM FASTBALL
h8ZC9z944cU_3 0 THE CUTTER IS ACCOMPLISHED BY EITHER CUTTING THE BALL TO THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT
h8ZC9z944cU_4 0 IF YOU WANT TO CUT THE BALL TO THE RIGHT AND YOU'RE A RIGHT HANDED PITCHER YOU WOULD CUT THE BALL IN HALF AND POSITION BOTH FINGERS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BALL
h8ZC9z944cU_5 0 IF YOU WANTED TO CUT THE BALL TO THE LEFT IN A CUTTER FASTBALL YOU'D POSITION YOUR FINGERS ON THE LEFT HALF OF THE BALL TO CREATE SPIN AND MOVEMENT THAT WOULD MAKE THE BALL BASICALLY CURVE TO THE RIGHT
Gk6n0ogrvbc_1 0 SO I'VE JUST CUT THIS TUBE THIS METAL TUBE ON MY BAND SAW
Gk6n0ogrvbc_2 0 THAT'S MAINLY BECAUSE I CAN'T FIND MY LITTLE PIPE CUTTER
Gk6n0ogrvbc_3 0 I BOUGHT THIS BRASS TUBE AND THE PIPE CUTTER AT A MODEL SHOP A MODEL BUILDING SHOP VERY HANDY RESOURCE FOR PUPPET MAKERS
Gk6n0ogrvbc_4 0 I CAN'T FIND THE PIPE CUTTER
Gk6n0ogrvbc_5 0 IT'S SOMEWHERE IN THE SHOP
Gk6n0ogrvbc_6 0 SO I USED THE BAND SAW
Gk6n0ogrvbc_7 0 BUT THEN I HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL TO SAND THIS IS A SANDING BLOCK FOAM SANDING BLOCK THE ENDS OF THOSE TUBES
Gk6n0ogrvbc_8 0 BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY'LL CUT RIGHT THROUGH THE DACRON
Gk6n0ogrvbc_9 0 SO I SAND AND THEY'RE SHARP
Gk6n0ogrvbc_10 0 SO THEY WOULD HURT THE PUPPETEER
Gk6n0ogrvbc_11 0 SO I SAND THE ENDS AND THEN I'LL ALSO USE EITHER A CIRCULAR A TINY CIRCULAR FILE WHICH I ALSO CAN'T FIND
Gk6n0ogrvbc_12 0 I HOPE YOUR SHOP IS MORE ORGANIZED THAN MINE
Gk6n0ogrvbc_13 0 OR A LITTLE TEENY ROLLED UP PIECE OF SANDPAPER
Gk6n0ogrvbc_14 0 WHICH I STICK INTO THE END OF THE TUBE
Gk6n0ogrvbc_15 0 AND I ROLL IT AROUND
Gk6n0ogrvbc_16 0 AND WHAT THAT DOES IS TAKE OFF ANY BURRS THAT REMAIN ON THE INSIDE OF THE TUBE
hC6eZ1a4Fj4_1 0 SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER THE LAST SIX BARRES OF OUR PIECE
hC6eZ1a4Fj4_2 0 MAKE SURE YOU WROTE EVERYTHING DOWN THE CHORD CHANGES AND THE ANALYSIS AT HOME BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE GOING THROUGH AND WALKING THE WHOLE PIECE
hC6eZ1a4Fj4_3 0 WE HAVE OUR FLAT TWO MINOR AND OUR FLAT SIX MINOR AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO UTILIZE THAT SAME SCALE PATTERN OUR MINOR PATTERN AND MOVE IT THROUGH THE ROOT
hC6eZ1a4Fj4_4 0 AND THEN WE HAVE OUR FIVE-SEVEN
hC6eZ1a4Fj4_5 0 AND OUR FIVE SEVEN-CHORD COMES OUT OF OUR MAJOR RIGHT SO IF WE HAVE B C D E F WE JUST USE THE ONE MAJOR SCALE THAT WE ALREADY LEARNED OFF OF B AND WE CAN JUST START ON THE FIFTH DEGREE AND WE'LL HAVE OUR F SEVENTH SCALE
hC6eZ1a4Fj4_6 0 SO WE START HERE
hC6eZ1a4Fj4_7 0 SO HERE'S OUR FLAT TWO RIGHT
hC6eZ1a4Fj4_8 0 FLAT TWO TO FLAT SIX
hC6eZ1a4Fj4_9 0 SO WE GOT FLAT TWO FLAT SIX TO FIVE
hC6eZ1a4Fj4_10 0 AND THAT'S GOING TO LEAD INTO OUR ONE CHORD WHICH BRINGS US RIGHT AT THE TOP AGAIN
hC6eZ1a4Fj4_11 0 SO WE HAVE FLAT TWO FLAT SIX FIVE WHICH BRINGS US RIGHT BACK TO OUR ONE CHORD AND RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE TUNE
h7EHvskA68w_1 0 SO I'M SITTING IN THE DOMAIN OF THE UTILITY MAN THE DUGOUT
h7EHvskA68w_2 0 THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE UTILITY MAN IS NOT IMPORTANT IT JUST MEANS HE'S NOT ON THE FIELD AT ALL TIMES
h7EHvskA68w_3 0 THE UTILITY MAN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE HE IS A GENERAL BACKUP TO JUST ABOUT EVERYONE ON THE FIELD
h7EHvskA68w_4 0 THE UTILITY MAN WHILE HE MAY NOT SPECIALIZE IN ANY SPECIFIC POSITION HE HAS TO BE GOOD AT A VARIETY OF POSITIONS
h7EHvskA68w_5 0 A GOOD UTILITY MAN LIKE WILSON BEDEMONT FOR THE NY YANKEES IS ABLE TO FILL IN AT THIRD BASE HE'S ABLE TO FILL IN AT SHORTSTOP SECOND BASE SOMETIMES SPELL THE FIRST BASEMAN
h7EHvskA68w_6 0 HE CAN A LITTLE BIT IN THE OUTFIELD DOES JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING EXCEPT PITCH AND CATCH
h7EHvskA68w_7 0 THOSE ARE SOME VERY SPECIALIZED POSITIONS AND GENERALLY UTILITY MEN DO NOT PLAY THEM
h7EHvskA68w_8 0 HOWEVER THE UTILITY MAN HAS TO BE READY TO COME INTO THE GAME AT ANY TIME IF THERE'S AN INJURY IF THERE'S A DEFENSIVE REPLACEMENT NECESSARY
h7EHvskA68w_9 0 ANY NUMBER OF SITUATIONS COULD RESULT IN A UTILITY MAN BEING CALLED ON AT ANY TIME IN THE GAME
h7EHvskA68w_10 0 GENERALLY WHAT A UTILITY MAN IS USED FOR IS TO BE PUT IN THE LATER INNINGS OF THE GAME AFTER A PINCH HITTER IS BEING USED
h7EHvskA68w_11 0 PERHAPS YOUR BEST PINCH HITTER IS ACTUALLY AN OUTFIELDER BUT YOU'RE GOING TO PINCH-HIT HIM FOR YOUR SECOND BASEMAN BECAUSE YOU NEED THE OFFENSE TO SCORE A RUN LATE IN THE GAME
h7EHvskA68w_12 0 SO THE UTILITY MAN WILL GO IN AND REPLACE THAT PINCH HITTER ON THE FIELD
h7EHvskA68w_13 0 YOU REALLY DON'T WANT A LEFT FIELDER PLAYING SECOND BASE
h7EHvskA68w_14 0 UTILITY MAN HAS A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES
h7EHvskA68w_15 0 HE HAS TO BE ABLE TO PLAY ANY NUMBER OF POSITIONS AT ANY GIVEN TIME
h7EHvskA68w_16 0 HE ALWAYS HAS TO BE READY TO GO AND HE'S VERY VERY ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF A GOOD TEAM
h7EHvskA68w_17 0 IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR SUCCESSFUL BASEBALL TEAMS THEY ALL HAVE ONE COMMON THREAD

GXsIprO6UWY_1 0 NOW WHAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS BASICALLY HOW TO JUST GO ABOUT MAKING A BEAT
GXsIprO6UWY_2 0 I'M BASICALLY GOING TO MAKE A BEAT AND TRY TO USE AS MANY SHORTCUTS AS POSSIBLE AND TO TRY TO REALLY GET YOU GOING BY USING PRESETS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
GXsIprO6UWY_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE ULTRA BEAT
GXsIprO6UWY_4 0 THE ULTRA BEAT IS A DRUM MACHINE WITHIN LOGIC EIGHT
GXsIprO6UWY_5 0 WE'RE GOING TO FIRST START OFF OUR SESSION BY GOING TO THE COMPOSE WINDOW AFTER WE CREATE A NEW ONE BY GOING TO FILE AND NEW
GXsIprO6UWY_6 0 WE'RE GOING TO GO TO COMPOSE AND WE'RE GOING TO PICK A HIP HOP TEMPLATE
GXsIprO6UWY_7 0 ONCE THIS IS OPEN THIS IS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO CREATE EVERYTHING
GXsIprO6UWY_8 0 WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY GO TO OUR TRACK SAVE OUR TRACK AND WE'RE GOING TO SAVE OUR TRACK AND JUST CREATE THE TRACK USING THE ULTRA BEAT
GXsIprO6UWY_9 0 WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP MAYBE LIKE ULTRA BEAT DRUMS AND LOOK IN OUR LIBRARY AND JUST KIND OF SEE WHAT KIND OF KITS THERE ARE AND REALLY JUST MESS AROUND WITH THEM BY CHANGING THE DIFFERENT KICKS USING THE GRID AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ULTRA BEAT AND USING PATTERN MODE BY TRIGGERING EACH PATTERN ONE AT A TIME AND RECORDING THAT DATA
Gg3A7jsrQyM_1 0 BEFORE WE MOVE ON WE WANT TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT LEAD AND FOLLOW
Gg3A7jsrQyM_2 0 AGAIN THE MAN IS IN CHARGE
Gg3A7jsrQyM_3 0 HE'S THE ONE WHO'S GOING TO BE LEADING EVERYTHING
Gg3A7jsrQyM_4 0 LADIES IT'S OUR JOB TO FOLLOW
Gg3A7jsrQyM_5 0 IN ORDER TO DO THAT EFFECTIVELY WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT ARM TENSION
Gg3A7jsrQyM_6 0 IF YOU HAVE LOOSEY GOOSEY ARMS WE CALL THEM SPAGHETTI ARMS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO FEEL WHAT THE GUYS WANTS YOU TO DO
Gg3A7jsrQyM_7 0 WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU AN EXERCISE THAT WILL HELP YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO GIVE THE RIGHT ARM TENSION
Gg3A7jsrQyM_8 0 BOTH OF YOU STAND FEET SHOULDER WIDTH APART
Gg3A7jsrQyM_9 0 THE PISTOL GRIP THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER GUYS YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE TWO PISTOL GRIPS
Gg3A7jsrQyM_10 0 LADIES YOU'RE GOING TO REST OF YOUR HANDS ON TOP
Gg3A7jsrQyM_11 0 WE WANT TO BE WITH BOTH OF OUR ELBOWS NEXT TO OUR BODY MEANING THEY'RE NOT OUT IN FRONT AND THEY'RE NOT BEHIND
Gg3A7jsrQyM_12 0 THAT'S THE CORRECT DISTANCE
Gg3A7jsrQyM_13 0 WHEN BOTH OF OUR ELBOWS ARE NEXT TO OUR BODY THEY CREATE A RIGHT ANGLE HERE LIKE AN L AND OUR HANDS CAN TOUCH
Gg3A7jsrQyM_14 0 THAT'S THE PERFECT DISTANCE
Gg3A7jsrQyM_15 0 WE DON'T WANT TO BE OUR HERE OR IN LIKE THIS
Gg3A7jsrQyM_16 0 THIS IS THE CORRECT DISTANCE
Gg3A7jsrQyM_17 0 THE RULES ARE NUMBER ONE YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR ELBOWS NEXT TO YOUR BODY
Gg3A7jsrQyM_18 0 THEY CAN'T COME IN FRONT
Gg3A7jsrQyM_19 0 THEY CAN'T GO BEHIND
Gg3A7jsrQyM_20 0 RULE NUMBER TWO NO THUMBS
Gg3A7jsrQyM_21 0 GUYS DON'T SQUEEZE THE GIRLS HANDS WITH YOUR THUMBS
Gg3A7jsrQyM_22 0 JUST REST THEM
Gg3A7jsrQyM_23 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS BOTH JUST PRESS IN TOWARD EACH OTHER TOGETHER LIKE THIS PUSHING AND PULLING
Gg3A7jsrQyM_24 0 NOTICE WE'RE NOT DOING THIS AND THAT
Gg3A7jsrQyM_25 0 WE'RE KEEPING OUR ARMS STILL
Gg3A7jsrQyM_26 0 WE'RE JUST LEANING INTO EACH OTHER AND PULLING AWAY
Gg3A7jsrQyM_27 0 THIS ESTABLISHES THE PROPER ARM TENSION
Gg3A7jsrQyM_28 0 HERE'S THE RULE
Gg3A7jsrQyM_29 0 GIRLS WHEN THE GUY PUSHES YOU PUSH BACK
Gg3A7jsrQyM_30 0 WHEN HE PULLS YOU PULL AWAY
Gg3A7jsrQyM_31 0 THAT'S THE FOUNDATION OF LEAD AND FOLLOW
Gg3A7jsrQyM_32 0 IF YOU JUST REACT TO WHAT HE'S DOING YOU'LL BE FINE

G6fiygpxY-0_33 0 RUBBER WHEELS THEY WON'T DO THAT
G6fiygpxY-0_34 0 ALRIGHT THERE WE GO WITH THE MUSTY LITE RIDER
gqRtM-jF3ZM_1 0 HI I'M KAREN FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
gqRtM-jF3ZM_2 0 NOW WE'LL PREPARE SOME DECORATIONS TO COMPLEMENT OUR LEMON MOUSSE
gqRtM-jF3ZM_3 0 MINT LEAVES ARE A NICE COMPLEMENT TO A LEMON MOUSSE
gqRtM-jF3ZM_4 0 I'M ALSO GOING TO PREPARE SOME LITTLE PURPLE FLOWERS OUT OF SUGAR PASTE OR A FONDANT
gqRtM-jF3ZM_5 0 SO I'LL GIVE YOU A QUICK LESSON ON HOW TO USE THE FONDANT
gqRtM-jF3ZM_6 0 THE FONDANT YOU CAN BUY IN ANY PLACE THAT SELLS CAKE DECORATING SUPPLIES AND IT COMES LIKE THIS IT LOOKS LIKE A DOUGH IT LOOKS AN AWFUL LIKE A MARZIPAN BUT IT'S SUGAR PASTE
gqRtM-jF3ZM_7 0 SO WHEN YOU GET IT IT'S KIND OF CRUMBLY AND IT SOFT BUT IT'S STILL A LITTLE CRUMBLY AND HARD AND YOU WANT TO SOFTEN IT
gqRtM-jF3ZM_8 0 SO FIRST YOU TAKE A LITTLE MARGARINE OR SHORTENING AND YOU GREASE YOUR HANDS AND THEN YOU KNEED THE FONDANT UNTIL IT'S VERY SMOOTH AND JUST ROLL IT AND FOLD IT BETWEEN YOUR HANDS UNTIL IT FEELS VERY SMOOTH
gqRtM-jF3ZM_9 0 NOW WHEN YOU GET TO A SMOOTH CONSISTENCY WE'LL ADD A LITTLE BIT OF FOOD COLORING AND THE BEST FOOD COLORING TO USE IS THE PASTE TYPE
gqRtM-jF3ZM_10 0 SO I'LL SHOW YOU THAT
gqRtM-jF3ZM_11 0 OKAY NOW THAT'S PRETTY SMOOTH NOW A LOT NICER THAN IT WAS
gqRtM-jF3ZM_12 0 TAKE A TOOTHPICK AND JUST DIP THE TOOTHPICK INTO YOUR FOOD COLORING
gqRtM-jF3ZM_13 0 I'M USING THE PURPLE AND JUST RUB THAT ONTO THE SUGAR PASTE JUST LIKE THAT
gqRtM-jF3ZM_14 0 THEN CONTINUING TO KNEED IT FOLDING IT INTO ITSELF AND THEN ROLLING AND FOLDING UNTIL THE COLOR IS UNIFORM
gLA2ZS6uNEQ_1 0 HI I'M EMILY LAREW
gLA2ZS6uNEQ_2 0 AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW TO DO SYNCOPATED PULL BACKS LANDING ON YOUR HEELS INSTEAD OF THE BALLS OF YOUR FEET
gLA2ZS6uNEQ_3 0 SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS I WANT YOU START AGAIN AT THE BAR LIFTING THE BALLS OF YOUR FEET
gLA2ZS6uNEQ_4 0 WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO START ON OUR HEELS TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE CHEAP MOTION BUT YOU'RE GOING TO END ON YOUR HEELS
gLA2ZS6uNEQ_6 0 SO YOU STILL HAVE BRUSH BRUSH
gLA2ZS6uNEQ_7 0 YOU'RE GOING TO LAND THEN INSTEAD OF THE BALLS OF YOUR FEET YOUR HEELS
gLA2ZS6uNEQ_9 0 SO THERE'S A LITTLE WEIGHT TRANSFER THAT YOU'VE GOT TO GET USED TO
gLA2ZS6uNEQ_10 0 AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO POSITION YOUR BODY FRONT AND BACK A LITTLE BIT IN BETWEEN
gLA2ZS6uNEQ_12 0 SO YOU'VE GOT TO ROLL WITH IT
gLA2ZS6uNEQ_13 0 SO WE'VE GOT BRUSH BRUSH HEEL HEEL
gLA2ZS6uNEQ_14 0 SO PULL BACK
gLA2ZS6uNEQ_17 0 SO MAKE SURE AGAIN THAT YOU GET THE BRUSH BRUSH HEEL HEEL
gLA2ZS6uNEQ_18 0 AND IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT TRICKIER BECAUSE YOUR ANKLE WORK IS SO SMALL HERE
gLA2ZS6uNEQ_19 0 BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST GOING WITH YOUR FEET BOM-BOM
gLA2ZS6uNEQ_20 0 YOU'VE GOT TO LAND RIGHT HERE
gLA2ZS6uNEQ_21 0 SO YOUR BRUSH IS ACTUALLY SMALLER AS WELL
gLA2ZS6uNEQ_22 0 SO KEEP IT MORE OF A TAP THAN A PULL BACK
gLA2ZS6uNEQ_24 0 SO YOU'VE GOT START HERE PULL BACK USE YOUR PLIEE AND PICK IT UP
gLA2ZS6uNEQ_28 0 AND THOSE ARE YOUR PICKUPS WITH HEELS
GfHucOeFuzE_2 0 I'M MICHAEL SETO AND IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE PROPER SETTINGS TO USE ON YOUR DIGITAL SLR FOR JEWELRY PHOTOGRAPHY
GfHucOeFuzE_3 0 SO WE'VE GOT HERE A NIKON D200
GfHucOeFuzE_4 0 WHEN YOU'RE SHOOTING JEWELRY THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS YOU NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT WITH YOUR CAMERA SETTINGS
GfHucOeFuzE_5 0 NUMBER ONE IS YOUR FILM SPEED OR ISO
GfHucOeFuzE_6 0 YOU WANT TO BE AS LOW AS POSSIBLE IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO USE ISO ONE HUNDRED
GfHucOeFuzE_7 0 THAT GIVES YOU THE MOST DETAIL AND THE LEAST NOISE
GfHucOeFuzE_8 0 SINCE YOU'RE SHOOTING IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT YOU CAN ADJUST THE LIGHT IT ALLOWS YOU TO GO TO A LOWER ISO
GfHucOeFuzE_9 0 THE SECOND THING YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS YOUR APERTURE
GfHucOeFuzE_10 0 THAT'S GOING TO CONTROL HOW MUCH DEPTH OF FIELD OR HOW MUCH OF YOUR PIECE OF JEWELRY IS IN FOCUS
GfHucOeFuzE_11 0 YOU WILL TEND TO WANT TO GO WITH A SMALLER APERTURE WHICH GIVES YOU MORE DEPTH OF FIELD SO SOMETHING SAY THIRTEEN OR SIXTEEN YOU MAY EVEN WANT TO GO UP TOWARDS TWENTY-TWO ALTHOUGH I DON'T LIKE GOING THAT HIGH BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU'LL GET SOME THE LIGHT DEFRACTS A LITTLE BIT AND IT MAKES THE PICTURE A LITTLE FUZZIER
GfHucOeFuzE_12 0 SO YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT YOUR ISO YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT YOUR SHUTTER SPEED AS WELL YOU WANT TO SHOOT MANUAL
GfHucOeFuzE_13 0 DON'T USE THE PROGRAM MODE
GfHucOeFuzE_14 0 SHOOT ON MANUAL AND YOU'LL HAVE TO WORK OUT THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR WHAT YOUR THE PROPER SHUTTER SPEED IS
GfHucOeFuzE_15 0 SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR SHUTTER SPEED YOUR APERTURE YOU WANT IT HIGHER YOUR FILM SPEED YOU WANT IT LOWER AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KEY SETTINGS ON YOUR DIGITAL SLR FOR JEWELRY PHOTOGRAPHY
hbtksI9ewLk_2 0 ANOTHER KICK DRILL THAT I DEVELOPED AT THE SAME TIME THAT I DEVELOPED THE CORNER POCKET KICK DRILL WAS THE SIDE POCKET KICK DRILL
hbtksI9ewLk_3 0 SAME SETUP PRETTY MUCH
hbtksI9ewLk_4 0 YOUR CUE BALL STARTS IN THE SAME PLACE
hbtksI9ewLk_5 0 IT'S WHAT'S CALLED THE FOOT SPOT OF THE TABLE
hbtksI9ewLk_6 0 IN OTHER WORDS THE CENTER OF THE TABLE THIS WAY AND THE SECOND DIAMOND UP
hbtksI9ewLk_7 0 YOUR OBJECT BALL STARTS RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF THE TABLE
hbtksI9ewLk_8 0 YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO KICK THE BALL IN EITHER ONE OF THESE TWO POCKETS FROM THAT SETUP
hbtksI9ewLk_9 0 THAT'S WHERE WE WANT TO START
hbtksI9ewLk_10 0 SO WE'RE BACK TO IDENTIFYING OUR ANGLE INTO THE CUSHION AND OUT ONCE AGAIN TO HIT THIS BALL
hbtksI9ewLk_11 0 SO WE WOULD IDENTIFY THAT AS A SPOT RIGHT ABOUT THERE
hbtksI9ewLk_12 0 NOW YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED
hbtksI9ewLk_13 0 IT WENT LONG
hbtksI9ewLk_14 0 I HIT IT TOO THIN AND IT WENT BEYOND THE POCKET
hbtksI9ewLk_15 0 BUT THIS IS REALLY GOOD PRACTICE RIGHT HERE BECAUSE NOW WE'RE GOING TO KICK AT THE BALL
hbtksI9ewLk_16 0 AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE TRYING TO CONTROL THE SPEED TO COME BACK AND JUST GENTLY NURSE IT UP IN FRONT OF THE POCKET SO THAT WE GET IT INTO EASY SCORING POSITION SO THAT WE CAN GO BACK AND FORTH ONCE AGAIN
hbtksI9ewLk_17 0 SO WE'RE REALLY GETTING A LOT OF BENEFIT OUT OF THIS DRILL
hbtksI9ewLk_18 0 SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK
hbtksI9ewLk_19 0 NEXT STROKE WOULD BE LIKE SUCH
hbtksI9ewLk_20 0 NOW IT'S IN PRETTY GOOD SCORING POSITION DEPENDING UPON HOW WELL I CAN KICK
hbtksI9ewLk_21 0 SO MY OBJECTIVE NOW IS TO COME OVER HERE WITH THE ANGLE THAT I NEED TO THEN KICK THE BALL INTO THIS POCKET
hbtksI9ewLk_22 0 AND OF COURSE I MISSED
hbtksI9ewLk_23 0 I ADDED A STROKE
hbtksI9ewLk_24 0 BUT I KEEP COUNTING STROKES UNTIL I POCKET IT IN EITHER ONE OF THESE POCKETS
hbtksI9ewLk_25 0 AND AGAIN I WANT TO WRITE DOWN THAT SCORE KEEP A LOG SO THAT I CAN ADD THEM ALL UP AND THEN KEEP AN AVERAGE
hbtksI9ewLk_26 0 AND DAY-TO-DAY I WANT MY AVERAGE TO COME DOWN TO THE VERY LOWEST POINT
hbtksI9ewLk_27 0 THAT'S WHEN I'LL KNOW THAT I'M BECOMING BETTER AT KICKING AT BALLS
GRkwQcHdRd4_1 0 MICHAEL PLUNKETT HELLO
GRkwQcHdRd4_2 0 THIS IS MICHAEL PLUNKETT ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GRkwQcHdRd4_3 0 WE'RE NOW GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR NEW TERM FOR GUITAR IT IS CALLED TREMOLO
GRkwQcHdRd4_4 0 AND YOU COULD SEE IT MARKED ON OUR GUITAR TABLATURE SCORE LIKE THIS TREM
GRkwQcHdRd4_6 0 WHAT IT BASICALLY MEANS IS THAT WE WANT TO CREATE A SOUND FROM A GUITAR THAT MIGHT MIMIC A VOICE OR A VIOLIN
GRkwQcHdRd4_7 0 IT'S A SUSTAINING SOUND ONE THAT DOESN'T STOP WHERE IT'S NORMALLY WHEN WE PLUCK A GUITAR
GRkwQcHdRd4_8 0 IT'S A SHORT TIME THAT DIES OFF
GRkwQcHdRd4_9 0 SO WE ACHIEVE THAT BY GETTING THIS KIND OF ROLL FIRST IN THE FINGER-PICKING STYLE WITH OUR FINGERS WHERE WE TAKE OUR RING MIDDLE AND INDEX AND REPEAT THEM ON A STRING
GRkwQcHdRd4_10 0 WE COULD ALTERNATE OUR THUMB ON A DIFFERENT STRING IF WE WANTED AND WOULD COME OUT LIKE THIS
GRkwQcHdRd4_11 0 SO YOU CAN HEAR IT KIND OF BRINGS A MORE SUSTAINED SOUND
GRkwQcHdRd4_12 0 NOW WE CAN ALSO DO THIS ON AN ELECTRIC GUITAR OR ANY TYPE OF GUITAR WHERE YOU'D BE USING A PICK
GRkwQcHdRd4_13 0 IN THIS CASE WE COULD BE PLAYING THE SAME STRINGS
GRkwQcHdRd4_14 0 BASICALLY IT'S JUST A MATTER OF MOVING THE PICK BACK AND FORTH VERY QUICKLY SO WE WOULD DO IT IT'S REALLY A WRIST MOTION THAT WE USE
GRkwQcHdRd4_15 0 SO IT CAN BE DONE BOTH WAYS BUT THE TERM TREMOLO MEANS A SHORT FAST REPEATING NOTE TO CREATE THAT SUSTAINED SOUND
GBb7UcYQizc_1 0 NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS INVOLVING YOUR DRIBBLING SKILLS INTO MAKING TRICKS
GBb7UcYQizc_2 0 BASICALLY WHAT I WANT TO TELL YOU FIRST ABOUT DOING TRICKS IS THE KEY IS YOU HAVE TO BE LOOSE YOU HAVE TO BE VERY RELAXED AND YOU HAVE TO BE ON YOUR TOES
GBb7UcYQizc_3 0 SO YOU CAN MAKE QUICK MOVES AND QUICK DECISIONS
GBb7UcYQizc_4 0 SO EVERYTHING I TAUGHT YOU IS USING COMBINATION TO MAKE TRICKS YOU GOT CUTS YOU HAVE THE ROLL OVER AND ALSO THERE IS A BASIC TRICK OF THE STEP OVER
GBb7UcYQizc_5 0 WHICH IS SHOWING WHAT THAT IS IT'S A FAKE JUST A FAKE TO ONE SIDE SO THEY THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GO THAT WAY BUT THE BALL IS JUST GOING TO KEEP GOING THE SAME WAY AND YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT
gMJe2MJJP7E_1 0 THIS IS KIND OF TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WEAPON IS COMING AT YOU WHETHER IT'S A KNIFE A JO LIKE THE FIVE FOOT STAFF OR A SWORD OR IF IT'S AN EMPTY HANDED ATTACK WHETHER IT'S A GRAB OR A STRIKE ANY TECHNIQUE THAT WE'VE GOT IN AIKIDO CAN BE APPLIED TO WHATEVER SITUATION
gMJe2MJJP7E_2 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK AND DO THE SAME TECHNIQUE BUT REAPPLY TO A JO
gMJe2MJJP7E_3 0 LAST TIME WE DID SOKUMEN IRIMINAGE WITH THE KNIFE TAKEAWAY THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE BASIC JODORI OR JO TAKEAWAY
gMJe2MJJP7E_4 0 SO AGAIN SOKUMEN IRIMINAGE
gMJe2MJJP7E_5 0 DANIEL IS JUST GOING TO COME IN WITH THE SKI
gMJe2MJJP7E_6 0 AS HE DOES OBVIOUSLY I NEED TO GET OFF LINE
gMJe2MJJP7E_7 0 I WANT TO TAP KEEPING ONE START WITH MY HANDS AS FAR APART THEN PUT ONE ON HIS HAND GET IN AS DEEP AS YOU CAN AND THEN I WANT TO SLIDE IN AND GET MY OTHER HAND OVER THE TOP
gMJe2MJJP7E_8 0 FACE THE SAME DIRECTION BRING THIS UP AND STRETCH BOTH MY ARMS OUT
gMJe2MJJP7E_9 0 SO IF DANIEL TSUKIS ON THIS SIDE I WANT TO ENTER SEE IF I CAN GET IN AS DEEP AS I CAN KEEP THIS OVER THE TOP RAISE UP STRETCH THE ARMS
gMJe2MJJP7E_10 0 IT'S REALLY THE HIPS TURNING AT THE VERY END THAT DOES IT
gMJe2MJJP7E_11 0 TRADITIONALLY WE WOULD AGAIN PLACE THE JO ON THE GROUND AND THEN WALK THROUGH OR WALK AWAY
gMJe2MJJP7E_12 0 SO FOR A TEST NICE AND CLEAN
gMJe2MJJP7E_13 0 NEXT WOULD BE AN UDA
gMJe2MJJP7E_14 0 SO THAT ONE WAS VERY DIRECT OKAY
gMJe2MJJP7E_15 0 MAYBE WE COME IN AND WE CAN'T PUSH TENKAN CUT DOWN THEN RE-ENTER
gMJe2MJJP7E_16 0 SO AS HE COMES IN GET TO THE OUTSIDE MAYBE I CAN'T GO THIS WAY TUCK AND TWIST WHEN YOU FIND SPACE AGAIN STRETCH
gMJe2MJJP7E_17 0 AGAIN IF HE'S DOING A REGULAR PUNCH TECHNIQUE WOULD LOOK VERY SIMILAR NICE AND EASY AND THROUGH OKAY
gMJe2MJJP7E_18 0 IT'S THE EXACT SAME TECHNIQUE EVEN WITH THE SKI
gMJe2MJJP7E_19 0 SAME THING WE'RE GOING TO GET OFF LINE TURN AND CUT
gUcfQLvQxMU_1 0 OH HI WELCOME
gUcfQLvQxMU_2 0 MY NAME IS SYLVIA RUSSELL AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO CUT A LITTLE BOYS HAIRCUT
gUcfQLvQxMU_3 0 NOW IF YOU'VE BEEN WANTING TO DO THIS YOURSELF AT HOME LET ME GET YOU STARTED
gUcfQLvQxMU_4 0 MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A WELL-RESTED LITTLE BOY
gUcfQLvQxMU_5 0 DON'T TRY TO CUT HIS HAIR AFTER FILLING HIM UP WITH SWEETS
gUcfQLvQxMU_6 0 MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A CLEAN CAPE OR TOWEL AND HAVE SOME CLIPPERS OR SCISSORS BY YOUR SIDE
gUcfQLvQxMU_7 0 NOW REMEMBER MAKE HIM FEEL COMFORTABLE AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET THE JOB DONE A WHOLE LOT EASIER
gUcfQLvQxMU_8 0 WE DON'T WANT HIM WIGGLING AND MOVING BECAUSE HE'S EATEN A LOT OF CANDY
gUcfQLvQxMU_9 0 REMEMBER THIS IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO AT HOME ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE AT A YOUNG AGE AND THEY DON'T NEED A WHOLE LOT OF UPKEEP
gUcfQLvQxMU_10 0 CUTTING YOUR LITTLE BOY'S HAIR COULD BE VERY EASY AND SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE AT HOME
gUcfQLvQxMU_11 0 REMEMBER IF YOU NEED SOME HELP ASK A PROFESSIONAL
gUcfQLvQxMU_12 0 TAKE HIM TO A BARBER AND SEE WHAT YOUR FRIENDS ARE DOING TO CUT THEIR LITTLE BOYS HAIR
gUcfQLvQxMU_13 0 MY NAME IS SYLVIA RUSSELL AND THIS IS HOW YOU CAN CUT YOUR LITTLE BOYS HAIR
gjwbeDWblOY_1 0 HI MY NAME IS VALERIE WITH EXPERTVILLAGE.COM WE ARE TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO THINGS WITH TWINS FROM CONCEPTION TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS
gjwbeDWblOY_2 0 IN THIS NEXT SEGMENT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO SAVE MONEY
gjwbeDWblOY_3 0 THERE IS OF COURSE TONS OF WAYS THAT YOU COULD SAVE MONEY WITH TWINS
gjwbeDWblOY_4 0 ONE OF THE WAYS I WOULD RECOMMEND IS BUYING DIAPERS IN BULK AT COSTCO OR SAM'S CLUB
gjwbeDWblOY_5 0 THEY ARE DEFINITELY A LOT CHEAPER THAT WAY
gjwbeDWblOY_6 0 ANOTHER WAY TO SAVE MONEY IS CLOTH DIAPERS WE DID THAT FOR A WHILE AND YOU JUST WASH THEM AT HOME OR HIRE A DIAPER SERVICES
gjwbeDWblOY_7 0 I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST FOR THE DIAPER SERVICE BUT YOU DO SAVE MONEY IF YOU DO IT AT HOME YOURSELF
gjwbeDWblOY_8 0 ANOTHER WAY IS TO MAKE YOUR OWN BABY FOOD
gjwbeDWblOY_9 0 WE DID THAT AND VACUUM SEALED IT IN A FOOD SAVER
gjwbeDWblOY_10 0 WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS YOU WOULD COOK DINNER
gjwbeDWblOY_11 0 ONCE THEY START EATING SOLID FOOD YOU KNOW LIKE PUREE IT IN SOME SORT OF BLENDER OR FOOD PROCESSOR AND WHAT I DID IS JUST MADE LITTLE VACUUM SEAL BAGS ABOUT SERVING SIZE FOR THE BABIES AND PACKAGED THEM AND DATED THEM THAT WAY YOU JUST MAKE A LITTLE EXTRA
g4hiewirHvw_1 0 SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SPEEDBOAT COMPARED TO OTHER STYLES OF BOATS ARE FOR INSTANCE WE SELL PONTOON BOATS ALSO
g4hiewirHvw_2 0 OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE LOOKING FOR A PONTOON BOAT IS GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT STYLE OF CUSTOMER THAN SOMEONE LOOKING FOR A SPEEDBOAT
g4hiewirHvw_3 0 A SPEEDBOAT'S MORE DESIGNED FOR SPEED COMFORT RIDE FIFTY TO SIXTY MILE AN HOUR PLUS SPEEDS WHERE OUR PONTOONS ARE GOING TO BE MORE FOR LOUNGING LIKE YOU'RE LOUNGING ON YOUR COUCH WATCHING TV AT HOME GOING FIFTEEN TO TWENTY-FIVE MILES AN HOUR
g4hiewirHvw_4 0 SO THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THE DIFFERENCES OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND BOATS OUT THERE THAT COMPARE TO SPEEDBOATS
g4hiewirHvw_5 0 THE LOOKS IS A BIG THING
g4hiewirHvw_6 0 A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS SPORTY LOOKS FAST
g4hiewirHvw_7 0 I MEAN JUST LIKE A GUY BUYING A PORSCHE OR A CORVETTE
g4hiewirHvw_8 0 HE WANTS TO BUY IT BECAUSE IT LOOKS AND WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS THAT WAY YOU KNOW IT GOES FAST AND YOU KNOW IT HAS SPEED BEHIND IT
g4hiewirHvw_9 0 SAME THING GOES WITH A SPEEDBOAT
g4hiewirHvw_10 0 WHEN SOMEONE PURCHASES A SPEEDBOAT THEY WANT TO KNOW THAT THAT BOAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO PUT SOME SPEED BEHIND IT
g4hiewirHvw_11 0 WHICH IS FIFTY PLUS MILES AN HOUR ON THE WATER WHICH IS RATHER FAST COMPARED TO A KAYAK OR A PONTOON OR A TUGBOAT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT DESIGNED FOR SPEED

H-BCSLY7XSo_1 0 HI I'M BETTY INGHAM AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE WE COULDN'T REPLACE THE WHITE SIDING BECAUSE IT WAS JUST TO EXPENSIVE SO WE PATCH IT
H-BCSLY7XSo_2 0 THERE'S CLABBER UNDERNEATH IT BUT IT WAS SO ROTTEN THAT THEY HAD ALREADY PUT THIS SIDING UP YEARS AGO WE PATCH IT WE EVEN PAINTED PART OF IT AT THE TOP
H-BCSLY7XSo_3 0 WHICH YOU CAN PAINT SIDING WE DIDN'T REALIZE BUT ANYWAY THE PORCH WAS RESTORED THERE WAS A CONCRETE FLOOR TO IT THAT WAS ALL THAT WAS THERE
H-BCSLY7XSo_4 0 WE MADE THE WE GOT THE SPINDLES WE RESTORED THE DOOR UPSTAIRS IS THE ORIGINAL DOOR AND WE PAINTED ALL THE LITTLE ORNATE FIXTURES THE COLORS THAT WE WERE VICTORIAN COLORS
H-BCSLY7XSo_5 0 AND THE F WERE ALL REPLACED TALL AND NOT VERY FAR APART BECAUSE OF CHILDREN FALLING OVER THE TOP AND GETTING THERE HEADS IN BETWEEN
Go2INfZ8Mtk_1 0 SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE AVEDA COLOR HAS COME A LONG WAY WITH GRAY COVERAGE
Go2INfZ8Mtk_2 0 THE WAY GRAY COVERAGE USED TO WORK WITH AVEDA IS THAT YOU HAD PURE TONES THAT YOU MIX WITH THE NATURAL SHADES
Go2INfZ8Mtk_3 0 I'M NOT GOING TO GET TOO TECHNICAL
Go2INfZ8Mtk_4 0 BASICALLY WHAT YOU HAVE IS A PURE TONE WHICH IS NN WHICH COVERS THE GRAY
Go2INfZ8Mtk_5 0 YOU HAVE YOUR YO WHICH WAS COVERING IT BEFORE
Go2INfZ8Mtk_6 0 AVEDA HAS REALLY MOVED INTO GRAY COVERAGE AND IS REALLY TAKING THAT MARKET OVER
Go2INfZ8Mtk_7 0 IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE BEFORE
Go2INfZ8Mtk_8 0 WHAT IS GREAT ABOUT AVEDA COVERAGE VERSUS LET'S SAY A CONSUMER GOING TO A STORE AND BUYING A BOXED COLOR IS YOU REALLY GET PERSONALIZATION
Go2INfZ8Mtk_9 0 WE CAN MATCH IDENTICALLY YOUR HAIR WITH THE PURE TONES WHICH IS REALLY GREAT
Go2INfZ8Mtk_10 0 COLOR WISE IT IS HEALTHIER
Go2INfZ8Mtk_11 0 IT IS 97 %PERCENT NATURALLY DRY SO YOU ARE NOT HAVING ANY KIND OF PETRO-CHEMICALS IN THE HAIR COLOR ABSORB INTO THE SCALP
Go2INfZ8Mtk_12 0 ALSO IF YOUR GRAY CHANGES BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT CHANGES WITH HORMONES IT CAN START LIKE A GRAY ALMOST A SLATE GRAY AND MOVE INTO A WHITE OR YELLOW GRAY
Go2INfZ8Mtk_13 0 WITH THE AVEDA PURE TONES LET'S SAY IF IT MOVED INTO A YELLOW TONE WE COULD USE A VIOLET TONE AND MAKE IT MORE OF A NATURAL LOOKING COLOR
Go2INfZ8Mtk_14 0 THAT'S WHAT IS REALLY GREAT ABOUT THE AVEDA COLOR VERSUS A CONSUMER COLOR
Go2INfZ8Mtk_15 0 IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY AND YOU ARE GOING TO GET YOUR TEETH CLEANED
Go2INfZ8Mtk_16 0 YOU WOULD GO TO A DENTIST TO DO THAT
Go2INfZ8Mtk_17 0 IT'S THE SAME WAY WITH GRAY COVERAGE
Go2INfZ8Mtk_18 0 IF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE IT DONE HAVE IT PROFESSIONALLY DONE BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST WAY TO GO
Go2INfZ8Mtk_19 0 THEN WE ALSO HAVE VOLUME-WISE BASICALLY IT GETS INTO CHEMISTRY OF WHAT WE MIX WITH COLOR
Go2INfZ8Mtk_20 0 WHAT THE TWENTY VOLUME DOES IS IT ALLOWS ME TO OPEN THE CUTICLE FOR THE FIRST FIFTEEN MINUTES TO DEPOSIT THE COLOR AND IT ALLOWS THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR THE LIFT PROCESS
Go2INfZ8Mtk_21 0 IT IS A REALLY GREAT COMBINATION OF COLOR TO USE FOR CONSUMER VERSUS GOING TO THE STORE AND GETTING IT OVER THE COUNTER

G4qh2s464gw_1 0 NEIL HUBBARD SO A BAGPIPE HAS FOUR SEPARATE REEDS IN IT
G4qh2s464gw_2 0 YOU'VE GOT THE CHANTER REED WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY LIKE AN OBOE REED IT'S A DOUBLE-CANE REED AND IT FITS IN TO THE TOP OF THE CHANTER HERE
G4qh2s464gw_3 0 BY ITSELF IT MAKES THAT LOVELY NOISE AND THE CHANTER IT MAKES THIS MUCH LOUDER NOISE
G4qh2s464gw_4 0 ARE YOU READY FOR THIS
G4qh2s464gw_5 0 DID MY FACE GETS ALL RED
G4qh2s464gw_7 0 THE DRONE REEDS USED TO BE MADE OUT OF CANE AND THIS IS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE
G4qh2s464gw_8 0 THEY HAVE A SPILT TONGUE HERE AND BY ITSELF IT SOUNDS LIKE A DUCK
G4qh2s464gw_9 0 THESE DAYS DRONE REEDS ARE NOT MADE OUT OF CANE
G4qh2s464gw_10 0 MOST COMMONLY THEY ARE MADE UP OF PLASTIC OR COMPOSITE MATERIALS
G4qh2s464gw_11 0 WHAT THIS DOES IS IT ALLOWS THE MANMADE MANUFACTURED PRODUCT TO BE EXACTLY THE SAME SO YOU'VE GOT PRECISELY MATCHING DRONE REEDS
G4qh2s464gw_12 0 THEY ALSO ARE MUCH EASIER TO KEEP IN TUNE AND THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO PROBLEMS FROM MOISTURE
G4qh2s464gw_13 0 THE PIECES OF THE PIPE ARE FITTED TOGETHER WITH JOINTS THAT ARE WRAPPED WITH A WAXED STRING CALLED HEMP AND THAT WAY IT SORT OF KEEPS A TIGHT JOINT THERE
G4qh2s464gw_14 0 THE BAG ITSELF THESE DAYS THEY HAVE A ZIPPER ON THEM SOME OF THEM WHICH ALLOWS ME TO OPEN IT UP AND GIVES ME EASIER ACCESS TO A MOISTURE CONTROL SYSTEM IN HERE WHICH CONTAIN A BOX FULL OF MOISTURE ABSORBING MATERIAL AND A TUBE THAT CATCHES MOISTURE
G4qh2s464gw_15 0 SO THAT'S THE BASIC CONSTRUCTION OF THE BAGPIPE AND THE SEPARATE PIECES OF IT
h5MXDqLMVSQ_1 0 NOW LETS TALK ABOUT HOW TO MIX OUR FACIAL CLEANSER
h5MXDqLMVSQ_2 0 YOU WANT TO START WITH A CLEAN BOWL A SET OF MEASURING SPOONS AND A BLENDER
h5MXDqLMVSQ_3 0 MEASURE OUT SOME OF YOUR ROLLED OATS AND MIX THEM IN TO A POWDER IN THE BLENDER LIKE I HAVE HERE
h5MXDqLMVSQ_4 0 ADD ONE TABLESPOON OF YOUR OAT FLOUR IN TO YOUR BOWL AND THEN ADD A TABLESPOON OF MILK
h5MXDqLMVSQ_5 0 THIS CAN EITHER BE REGULAR MILK OR SOY MILK
h5MXDqLMVSQ_6 0 ADD THAT TO YOUR BOWL
h5MXDqLMVSQ_7 0 THEN ADD A TEASPOON OF HONEY
h5MXDqLMVSQ_8 0 NOW YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND MIX THIS UP IN YOUR BLENDER OR WITH A SMALL BATCH LIKE THIS I LIKE TO JUST GO AHEAD AND MIX IT IN THE BOWL
h5MXDqLMVSQ_9 0 JUST MIX THAT UP UNTIL YOU HAVE A CONSISTENCY THAT YOU ARE HAPPY WITH
h5MXDqLMVSQ_10 0 IF YOU NEED TO MAKE THIS THICKER JUST GO AHEAD AND ADD SOME MORE OATMEAL
h5MXDqLMVSQ_11 0 BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO ADD TOO MUCH OATMEAL OR YOU COULD END UP DRYING YOUR SKIN OUT
h5MXDqLMVSQ_12 0 THAT LOOKS LIKE A GOOD CONSISTENCY SO LETS JUST GO AHEAD AND APPLY IT
GNkOpmre2AU_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M LIZBETH MULLER AND TODAY I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO MAKE SOME CUBAN STYLE PICADILLO
GNkOpmre2AU_2 0 TOMATO SAUCE IS THE NEXT INGREDIENT AND I'LL BE PLACING A FULL CAN OF TOMATO SAUCE
GNkOpmre2AU_3 0 I HAVE PEOPLE WHO USE THE CHUNKY SAUCE WITH PIECES OF TOMATO
GNkOpmre2AU_4 0 MEXICANS ACTUALLY USE THAT KIND OF STYLE
GNkOpmre2AU_5 0 SOMETIMES THEY USE A LITTLE CHUNKIER TYPE OF PICADILO
GNkOpmre2AU_6 0 YOU CAN DO THAT ALSO
GNkOpmre2AU_7 0 THERE'S NO PERFECT WAY OF DOING PICADILLO
GNkOpmre2AU_8 0 THIS IS MY WAY AND I USE THE CAN TOMATO SAUCE RIGHT HERE
GNkOpmre2AU_9 0 MY NEXT INGREDIENT IS GOING TO BE THE EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL
GNkOpmre2AU_10 0 I'M GOING TO PUT A LITTLE BIT IN THERE BECAUSE THE PORK AND THE MEAT ALREADY HAVE GREASE THAT'S GOING TO SUBSTITUTE AND IS GOING TO MAKE SOME MORE GREASE IN THERE
GNkOpmre2AU_11 0 I DON'T WANT A LOT OF GREASE
GNkOpmre2AU_12 0 I JUST WANT A LITTLE BIT OF THE EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL
h28KDkYXolE_1 0 HERE IS ANOTHER GREAT CLASSIC KNOT
h28KDkYXolE_2 0 THIS IS A SQUARE KNOT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE REEF KNOT
h28KDkYXolE_3 0 IF YOU LOOK DOWN HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT I'VE GOT TWO LINES THAT I'M GOING TO BE USING HERE
h28KDkYXolE_4 0 I GOT MY RED AND MY BLUE AND WHAT I'M GOING TO IS I'M GOING TO TAKE MY BLUE LINE AND I'M GOING TO WRAP IT UNDER LIKE SO
h28KDkYXolE_5 0 CREATING A BITE HERE THAT IS GOING TO ENCASE MY LINE MY RED LINE WITHIN IT
h28KDkYXolE_6 0 AND I'M GOING TO TAKE MY RED LINE AND I'M GOING TO BRING IT OVER I'M GOING TO BRING IT UNDER BOTH OF THESE LINES LIKE SO
h28KDkYXolE_7 0 THERE WE GO AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS AND LOOP THIS BACK
h28KDkYXolE_8 0 PULL OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE LENGTH HERE LETS KEEP THIS PART RIGHT UP HERE AND THIS DOWN
h28KDkYXolE_9 0 LOOP THIS BACK OVER LIKE SO
h28KDkYXolE_10 0 NOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS LINE HERE AND ITS GOING TO COME OVER BOTH OF THESE AND THEN BACK THROUGH
h28KDkYXolE_11 0 AS YOU CAN SEE I'VE CREATED LIKE A LITTLE CROSS HERE
h28KDkYXolE_13 0 AND IT KIND OF WEAVED IN TOGETHER WITH ONE ANOTHER
h28KDkYXolE_14 0 AND AS YOU PULL THESE YOU'LL SEE IT WILL COME TOGETHER RATHER NICELY
h28KDkYXolE_15 0 THIS IS YOUR REEF SLASH SQUARE KNOT
h28KDkYXolE_16 0 NOW WHAT'S REALLY GREAT ABOUT THIS KNOT IS YOU CAN TAKE THIS EVEN FURTHER IF YOU'RE SO INCLINED
h28KDkYXolE_17 0 AND YOU CAN TAKE IT WRAP THIS ROPE OVER THAT ONE
h28KDkYXolE_18 0 THIS ROPE OVER THOSE TWO MY LINE BACK OVER THESE TWO
h28KDkYXolE_19 0 AND BRING THIS ONE BACK THROUGH HERE AND CREATE ANOTHER SQUARE KNOT UP ON TOP OF THIS
h28KDkYXolE_20 0 NOW THIS HAS GONE PAST WHAT THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN USED FOR
h28KDkYXolE_21 0 THE SQUARE KNOT RIGHT HERE WOULD HAVE BEEN USED INITIALLY SAY IF YOU HAD A BATH ROBE AND SAY IF YOU JUST HAD YOUR LINES COMING AROUND YOUR WAIST THEN YOU WOULD JUST TIE YOUR SQUARE KNOT
h28KDkYXolE_22 0 BUT IF YOU'RE DOING THIS RIGHT HERE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO END UP DOING IS YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WEAVING THIS INTO A LINE
h28KDkYXolE_23 0 AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS LINE RIGHT HERE WAS WEAVED STARTING WITH OUR SQUARE KNOT
h28KDkYXolE_24 0 AND JUST WEAVED ALL THE WAY DOWN CREATING THIS NICE THICK ROPE THAT WE HAVE HERE
h28KDkYXolE_25 0 NOW THIS ONE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF PRACTICAL PURPOSES BEING THIS BIG BUT IF YOU DO IT ON A SMALLER LINE THIS IS A NICE GREAT WEAVING HERE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN TRUST AND PUT A LOT OF WEIGHT ON
GLOlsQlTENo_1 0 OKAY IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO DO THE E MAJOR BARRE CHORD WHICH AT THE TWELFTH FRET WHICH ALSO REPRESENTS THE FIRST OCTAVE IS E ON THE TWELFTH FRET
GLOlsQlTENo_2 0 SO YOU HAVE THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BY OCTAVE IS YOU START OPEN E AND THEN OF COURSE THIS WOULD MAKE E THE FOURTEENTH FRET FOR YOUR THIRD AND FOURTH FINGERS ON THE A AND D STRINGS
GLOlsQlTENo_3 0 YOUR SECOND FINGER ON THE THIRTEENTH FRET AND BARRING THE B AND E STRINGS AT THE TWELFTH FRET
GLOlsQlTENo_4 0 SO IT WILL SOUND LIKE THIS WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS POSITIONED PROPERLY THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD SOUND
GLOlsQlTENo_5 0 NOW IF YOU WANT TO PLAY IT DOWN HERE WHICH MOST PEOPLE DO YOU CAN PLAY IT HERE AT THE SEVENTH FRET AND BARRING THE D G AND B STRINGS ON THE NINTH FRET WHICH IS FAR MORE COMMON AND MUCH EASIER TO PLAY
GLOlsQlTENo_6 0 BUT IF YOU WANT THE EXTRA COOL LITTLE TONALITY THERE WITH THE HIGH E YOU CAN GO AND THAT'S YOUR E MAJOR BARRE CHORD
gdAqVJyS09M_1 0 HI I'M CHRIS BRYCE FROM SUPERSERVICE.COM
gdAqVJyS09M_2 0 TODAY I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO OPEN RAR FILES THAT'S R-A-R FILES
gdAqVJyS09M_3 0 FILES WITH THE EXTENSION OF RAR ARE COMPRESSED FILES THAT ARE NORMALLY CREATED ON LINUX SYSTEMS
gdAqVJyS09M_4 0 IN ORDER TO OPEN THOSE FILES YOU'LL NEED AN UNCOMPRESSION SOFTWARE SIMILAR TO THE ZIP PROGRAMS THAT YOU'LL FIND ON THE INTERNET
gdAqVJyS09M_5 0 WINDOWS INHERENTLY HAS THE ABILITY TO OPEN ZIP FILES BUT IT CAN'T PROCESS THE RAR FILES
gdAqVJyS09M_6 0 IN ORDER TO OPEN RAR YOU'LL NEED A PROGRAM SIMILAR TO 7-ZIP
gdAqVJyS09M_7 0 7-ZIP IS A FREE PROGRAM YOU CAN GET OFF THE INTERNET THAT ALLOWS YOU TO OPEN THOSE PROGRAMS
gdAqVJyS09M_8 0 THERE'S ALSO SHAREWARE VERSIONS OF IT AVAILABLE
gdAqVJyS09M_9 0 ONCE YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU HAVE A SOFTWARE ON YOUR COMPUTER LIKE 7-ZIP THAT CAN OPEN THE RAR FILES THERE'S AN OPTION TO EXECUTE THE PROGRAM AS PART OF YOUR EXPLORER SHELL SO THAT IN OPENING MY COMPUTER OR WINDOWS EXPLORER YOU'LL BE ABLE TO JUST RIGHT CLICK ON THE FILE AND UNZIP IT FROM THERE OR UN-RAR IT FROM THERE
gdAqVJyS09M_10 0 ALSO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY ON SOME OF THE PROGRAMS TO CREATE A RAR FILE AND THIS CAN BE ADVANTAGEOUS IF YOU NEED TO OPEN THE RAR FILE ADAPT A FILE IN THERE RE-RARR IT AND THEN SEND IT OFF TO SOMEONE ELSE
gdAqVJyS09M_11 0 THAT'S HOW YOU OPEN A RAR FILE
GAEsHM0yYTg_2 0 THIS IS JOHN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GAEsHM0yYTg_3 0 IN THIS VIDEO CLIP I WILL BE TAKING YOU THROUGH STEP THREE IN OUR PROCEDURE FOR BLEEDING YOUR BRAKES
GAEsHM0yYTg_4 0 THE NEXT STEPS REQUIRE TWO PEOPLE
GAEsHM0yYTg_5 0 WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS I AM GOING TO TELL THE PERSON INSIDE THE CAR TO STEP ON THE BRAKE PEDAL
GAEsHM0yYTg_6 0 AS THEY DO THAT I AM GOING TO LOOSEN UP THE BLEEDER SCREW AND FLUID IS GOING TO COME OUT AND THEN I AM GOING TO TIGHTEN IT UP BEFORE THE PERSON IN THE CAR LETS OFF THE BRAKE PEDAL
GAEsHM0yYTg_7 0 IF WE DON'T DO IT IN THIS SEQUENCE THEN AIR COULD FEASIBLY GET INTO THE BRAKE LINES
GAEsHM0yYTg_8 0 PUSH IT LET OFF PUSH IT LET OFF YOU MAY NEED TO DO THIS THREE OR FOUR TIMES BEFORE YOU GET A STEADY STREAM OF BRAKE FLUID TO COME OUT
h0Ed5hjhfgg_1 0 ALRIGHT WE ARE BACK WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE ARE GOING TO TUNE OUR GUITAR
h0Ed5hjhfgg_2 0 BECAUSE IF IT IS NOT IN TUNE IT IS GOING TO SOUND HORRIBLE NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOU ARE
h0Ed5hjhfgg_3 0 OKAY IT IS VERY IMPORTANT I JUST WENT TO A CONCERT LAST NIGHT AND EVERYBODY TUNED IT WAS WEIRD BEFORE THEY PLAYED
h0Ed5hjhfgg_4 0 SO YOU HAVE SIX STRINGS ON YOUR GUITAR AND I LIKE TO USE THIS LITTLE GUIDE AT THE END OF MY GUITAR IT IS CALLED A ELECTRONIC TUNER
h0Ed5hjhfgg_5 0 YOU CAN USE A ELECTRONIC TUNER YOU CAN USE A TUNING FORK SOMETHING THAT THEY USE BACK IN THE OLD DAYS JUST BANGING ON YOUR KNEES WITH A PIECE OF METAL
h0Ed5hjhfgg_6 0 IT GIVES YOU A PITCH BUT I'M GOING TO USE THIS TO CHECK MY TUNING
h0Ed5hjhfgg_7 0 THE FIRST STRING THE BIGGEST STRING IS CALLED THE E STRINGS SO I HAVE ALREADY TUNED SO THAT MAKES IT A LITTLE EASY
h0Ed5hjhfgg_8 0 THE NEXT STRING IS A A STRING
h0Ed5hjhfgg_9 0 THE THIRD STRING IS THE D STRING
h0Ed5hjhfgg_10 0 THE FORTH IS THE G STRINGS
h0Ed5hjhfgg_11 0 THE FIFTH IS THE B STRINGS AND THE SIXTH IS ANOTHER E STRINGS WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME PITCH AS THIS JUST HIGHER BUT YOU CAN TELL IT SOUNDS THE SAME
h0Ed5hjhfgg_12 0 YOU CAN ALSO TUNE THE GUITAR TO ITSELF IF YOU CAN GET THE FIRST STRING AND TUNE WITH SOMETHING ELSE
h0Ed5hjhfgg_13 0 THIS WOULD TEACH YOU A LOT ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE GUITAR
h0Ed5hjhfgg_14 0 IF I PLAY THE FIRST STRING ON THE FIFTH FRET ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE IT SHOULD SOUND THE SAME AS THE NEXT STRING OPEN
h0Ed5hjhfgg_15 0 AND IT DOES AND THE SAME FOR THE NEXT PAIR OF STRINGS AND FOR THE NEXT PAIR
h0Ed5hjhfgg_16 0 THE NEXT PAIR IS OLD BALL IT IS THE FORTH FRET AND THE NEXT STRING OPEN AND THEY SHOULD SOUND THE SAME
h0Ed5hjhfgg_17 0 THE LAST ONE IS BACK TO THE OLD DEAL FIFTH FRET
h0Ed5hjhfgg_18 0 SO ONCE AGAIN PLAYING GUITAR THAT'S IT
h0Ed5hjhfgg_19 0 REAL BRIEFLY I WOULD COVER HARMONICS DUE TO THE PHYSICS OF THE GUITAR IF YOU TOUCH THE STRING WE WOULD COVER THIS LATER IT PRODUCES A CHARMING SOUND
h0Ed5hjhfgg_20 0 SO IF I TOUCH THE FIRST STRING ON THE FIFTH FRET AND THE NEXT ONE THE SEVEN IT SHOULD SOUND THE SAME THAT IS ANOTHER WAY TO TUNE AND SO FAR
h0Ed5hjhfgg_21 0 THAT IS TUNING SO THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT WE WANT TO SOUND GOOD SO TO TUNE UP YOUR GUITARS I WOULD GIVE YOU A FEW MINUTES AND THEN WE WOULD COME BACK AND WE WOULD TALK ABOUT THE MUSIC ALPHABET
GmZ1X1PsgDE_1 0 HEY GUYS IN TODAY'S TOPIC WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW A DJ MIXER WORKS
GmZ1X1PsgDE_2 0 LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS
GmZ1X1PsgDE_3 0 IN YOUR BASIC DJ MIXER YOU USUALLY GOT TWO CHANNELS LEFT AND RIGHT
GmZ1X1PsgDE_4 0 AND THOSE ARE REALLY BASICALLY YOUR LEFT AND RIGHT SOURCES IN THIS CASE TWO TURNTABLES
GmZ1X1PsgDE_5 0 AND THEN YOU'VE A SELECTOR SWITCH FOR YOUR CUE OR FOR YOUR HEADPHONES
GmZ1X1PsgDE_6 0 THAT'S GOING TO CUE YOUR HEADPHONES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
GmZ1X1PsgDE_7 0 AND BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS ALL THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AS YOU'RE DJING IS THE DJ IS BASICALLY ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE CROWD AND BASICALLY IN THE HEADPHONES CUING UP THE NEXT SONG BEFORE HE ACTUALLY BRINGS IT IN AND TURNS THE VOLUME UP FOR THE CROWD TO HEAR
GmZ1X1PsgDE_8 0 LET'S GET FAMILIAR WITH THE PARTS OF A DJ MIXER
GmZ1X1PsgDE_9 0 IN ANY DJ MIXER YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A GAIN WHICH IS TO SAY THE VOLUME COMING INTO THE MIXER FROM THE TURNTABLES
GmZ1X1PsgDE_10 0 YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE A SECTION OF EQUALIZER LOW FREQUENCY MID-FREQUENCY AND HIGH FREQUENCY
GmZ1X1PsgDE_11 0 AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A VOLUME FADER WHICH CONTROLS THE VOLUME THAT GOES OUT TO THE HOUSE AND THE HOUSE IS BASICALLY WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS LISTENING TO
GmZ1X1PsgDE_12 0 IS ALSO ON MOST DJ MIXERS GOT A BASIC CROSS-FADER WHICH FADES BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE LEFT SOUND SOURCE AND THE RIGHT SOUND SOURCE
GmZ1X1PsgDE_13 0 AND YOU'VE GOT A MASTER VOLUME AND THAT MASTER VOLUME IS YOUR VOLUME FOR THE HOUSE
GmZ1X1PsgDE_14 0 THAT'S A BASIC DJ MIXER
GWrZrpPaQkc_1 0 HELLO I'M CHIEF MALLON WITH THE CLEARWATER KUNG FU CENTER
GWrZrpPaQkc_2 0 THIS IS MY ASSISTANT MELISSA AND THIS IS KUNG FU FOR HEALTH
GWrZrpPaQkc_3 0 WE'RE WORKING KUNG FU COMBINATIONS TODAY

GWrZrpPaQkc_6 0 WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN THIS ONE WITH OUR PALM BLOCK SO YOU'RE GOING TO BRING YOUR LEFT HAND OUT PALM BLOCK
GWrZrpPaQkc_7 0 NOW HERE YOU'RE GOING TO BRING YOUR RIGHT HAND FORWARD YOUR RIGHT HAND IS GOING TO LIFT AND IT'S GOING TO COME FORWARD AND IT'S GOING TO PUNCH YOUR LEFT PALM

gFq-hog96so_1 0 AMANDA CLAIRE ALL RIGHT
gFq-hog96so_2 0 SO THERE'S REALLY ONLY TWO SAFETY CONCERNS WHEN YOU'RE CIRCUIT BENDING AND THE FIRST I'VE ALREADY MENTION WHICH IS YOU NEVER NEVER WANT TO CIRCUIT BEND SOMETHING THAT PLUGS INTO THE WALL UNLESS YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT ELECTRONICS AND YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND VOLTAGE AND THE RISKS AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AC AND DC AND YOU KNOW ABOUT CAPACITORS AND WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO
gFq-hog96so_3 0 SO CIRCUIT BENDING THINGS THAT ARE BATTERY POWERED LOW VOLTAGE IS VERY VERY SAFE
gFq-hog96so_4 0 JUST DON'T EVER DO ANYTHING THAT PLUGS INTO A WALL UNTIL YOU REALLY FEEL THAT YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT ELECTRONICS AND THAT YOU ARE KIND OF COMFORTABLE WITH GOING DOWN THAT ROAD BUT I PERSONALLY WOULDN'T DO IT
gFq-hog96so_5 0 WHEN YOU ARE CIRCUIT BENDING SOMETHING THAT'S LOW VOLTAGE YOU WON'T GET A SHOCK I DON'T KNOW MAYBE SOMETHINGS THAT RUN OFF OF A LOT BATTERIES AND MAYBE HAVE SOME BIG CAPACITORS IN THEM YOU MIGHT GET A LITTLE TINGLE OR SOMETHING BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN SHOCKED BY ANYTHING AND IT KIND OF MAKES SENSE BECAUSE I MEAN THEY JUST RUN ON SUCH LOW VOLTAGE THERE'S JUST LITTLE AA BATTERIES IN THEM AND SO
gFq-hog96so_6 0 AND MOST OF THEM DON'T HAVE LARGE CAPACITORS IN THEM SO YOU'RE REALLY NOT GOING TO GET SHOCKED
gFq-hog96so_7 0 THE ONLY REAL RISK THAT THERE IS IN WORKING WITH CIRCUIT BOARDS FROM AN ELECTRONICS POINT OF VIEW IS SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT A BEND OR TRY SOMETHING OUT THAT MIGHT FRY SOMETHING IN THE CIRCUIT BOARD LIKE YOU MIGHT FRY A CAPACITOR OR MAYBE IF YOU SEND LIKE A LOT OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE BOARD TOO CLOSE TO THE POWER SOURCE OR TOO CLOSE TO CAPACITORS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
gFq-hog96so_8 0 SOMETIMES YOU CAN BAKE THAT CIRCUIT BOARD BUT AT LEAST YOU CAME OUT OF IT UNSCATHED RIGHT
gFq-hog96so_9 0 SO THAT'S THOSE ARE THE ONLY RISKS FORM KIND OF THE ELECTRICAL POINT OF VIEW BASICALLY NONE IF YOUR STAYING WITH BATTERY POWERED DEVICES
gFq-hog96so_10 0 AND THEN WE'RE NEXT GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE RISKS FROM THE SOLDERING IRON WHICH IS KIND OF AN IMPORTANT THING TO THINK ABOUT

H9lraNCDddE_3 0 AS YOU CAN SEE THE HOLES IN THE CAGE ARE LARGE ENOUGH THAT A CAT CAN STICK HIS FOOT THROUGH AND RUSTY HERE IS DEMONSTRATING HIS INTEREST THAT HE HAS IN HIS NEW CAGE
H9lraNCDddE_4 0 SO THIS A GREAT WAY TO INTRODUCE A NEW CAT TO THE NEW ANIMAL IS TO START WITH THE CAGE
H9lraNCDddE_5 0 I HAVE THE BUNNY OUT IN A CARRIER SO IT CAN'T BE STARTLED BY THE CAT AND THE CAT CAN HAVE TIME TO SNIFF AROUND AND LOOK AT THE CAGE AND GET USED TO IT
H9lraNCDddE_6 0 NOW IF YOUR CAT IS VERY INTERESTED IN THIS BUNNY CAGE HIS PROBABLY GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTED IN THE BUNNY

HeCm6zVvb34_1 0 MY RIDER HAS MADE FREQUENT ATTEMPTS TO TRY TO CATCH HER HORSE
HeCm6zVvb34_2 0 EACH TIME SHE WALKS UP TO THE HORSE THE HORSE WANTS TO MOVE RIGHT AWAY AND IN FACT GET RATHER FRISKY
HeCm6zVvb34_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO SHOW WHAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO TO CATCH THAT HORSE THAT'S BECOME JUST A LITTLE BIT DISOBEDIENT
HeCm6zVvb34_4 0 MY RIDER WOULD MAKE A BIG WIDE CIRCLE ANYTIME THAT SHE THOUGHT THE HORSE WAS GOING TO START UP AND GET ACTIVE AGAIN
HeCm6zVvb34_5 0 RIGHT NOW THE HORSE HAS ITS HEAD TURNED TO HER

h67Jrl0mgHw_1 0 SO HOW TO BECOME A NURSE
h67Jrl0mgHw_2 0 WELL THERE ARE REALLY SEVERAL THINGS YOU WANT TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION FIRST
h67Jrl0mgHw_3 0 ONE WHAT LEVEL OF NURSING YOU WANT TO DO
h67Jrl0mgHw_4 0 THERE ARE VARIOUS LEVELS OF NURSING
h67Jrl0mgHw_5 0 THERE'S THE LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSE OR AN LVN
h67Jrl0mgHw_6 0 THERE'S THE REGISTERED NURSE AND THEN YOU HAVE ADVANCED PRACTICE NURSING WHICH WOULD INCLUDE NURSE PRACTITIONERS NURSE ANESTHETISTS AND CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES
h67Jrl0mgHw_7 0 IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT AN LVN PROGRAM TO BECOME A LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSE REALLY THAT'S A TECHNICAL PROGRAM
h67Jrl0mgHw_8 0 THEY'RE OFFERED THROUGH A NUMBER OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND IT'S TYPICALLY A YEAR TO MAYBE EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF STUDY AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE YOU GET YOUR LVN CERTIFICATE AND YOU CAN BECOME A A CERTIFIED LVN WHICH WOULD THEN ENABLE YOU TO WORK
h67Jrl0mgHw_9 0 IT'S LIKE SIMILAR TO A NURSE YOU'RE NURSING LICENSE
h67Jrl0mgHw_10 0 THE NEXT LEVEL WOULD BE A REGISTERED NURSE
h67Jrl0mgHw_11 0 NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN ORDER TO BECOME A REGISTERED NURSE
h67Jrl0mgHw_12 0 YOU CAN GO TO AN ASSOCIATE PROGRAM IN NURSING AND ALMOST EVERY JUNIOR COLLEGE OFFERS A NURSING PROGRAM
h67Jrl0mgHw_13 0 IT'S A TWO YEAR COURSE OF STUDY
h67Jrl0mgHw_14 0 PART OF THE TIME IS IS DEDICATED TO LEARNING THE SCIENCE OF HEALTH CARE AND THEN PART OF IT IS LEARNED TO IS DEDICATED TO THE PRACTICAL ASPECTS AND AFTER THE TWO YEAR PROGRAM YOU CAN BECOME A REGISTERED NURSE
h67Jrl0mgHw_15 0 AND THAT THAT IS A STATE FUNCTION IT'S A LICENSING FUNCTION AND THAT ALLOWS YOU TO THEN WORK AS A NURSE
h67Jrl0mgHw_16 0 NOW FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT IS PERFECT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN A CAREER OF NURS IN NURSING
h67Jrl0mgHw_17 0 IF YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR NURSING CAREER TO THE NEXT LEVEL HOWEVER YOU WOULD WANT TO AT A MINIMUM HAVE A BACHELORS IN NURSING
h67Jrl0mgHw_18 0 AND FOR THAT YOU'D HAVE TO ATTEND A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY AND MAJOR IN NURSING AND THAT IS A FOUR YEAR COURSE OF STUDY
h67Jrl0mgHw_19 0 WHEN YOU COMPLETE YOUR BSN AS IT'S CALLED OR BACHELORS OF SCIENCE AND NURSING THEN YOU CAN SIT FOR THE SAME STATE LICENSING EXAM AS YOU AS WOULD ANY OTHER RN AND THEN YOU ARE CERTIFIED TO WORK AS A NURSE EXCEPT YOU ALSO HAVE THE BACHELORS DEGREE BEHIND YOU
h67Jrl0mgHw_20 0 AND THAT CAN REALLY OPEN DOORS PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN NURSE MANAGEMENT OR IF YOU WANT TO WORK AT A REALLY HIGH IN A REALLY HIGH TECH FIELD SUCH AS SURGICAL NURSING OR SOME OTHER SUB-SPECIALTY IN IN NURSING
h67Jrl0mgHw_21 0 THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF NURSE IS THE NURSE PRACTITIONER OR ADVANCED PRACTICE NURSE WHICH ALSO INCLUDES CERTIFIED NURSE ANESTHETISTS AND CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES
h67Jrl0mgHw_22 0 AND FOR THAT IT ALSO REQUIRES A MASTERS DEGREE IN ADDITION TO YOUR NURSING COURSE OF STUDY SO FOR THAT PROGRAM YOU WOULD DO A FOUR YEAR BACHELORS DEGREE PROGRAM IN NURSING AND THEN GO ON TO YOUR MASTERS WORK IN WHATEVER FIELD YOU WANTED TO SPECIALIZE IN AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS WORK IN A WIDE VARIETY OF FIELDS AND ESSENTIALLY FUNCTION AS INDEPENDENT MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS
h67Jrl0mgHw_23 0 THEY HAVE TO BE SUPERVISED BY A PHYSICIAN BUT THEY SEE PATIENTS INDIVIDUALLY THEY MAKE DIAGNOSES THEY PRESCRIBE MEDICINES
h67Jrl0mgHw_24 0 THEY DO A LOT OF THE SAME FUNCTIONALITY AS WOULD AN MD
G-ZeZ-O0joU_2 0 I'M LUCY SPAIN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE HERE TO TALK ABOUT CHEERLEADING JUMPS AND TUMBLING
G-ZeZ-O0joU_3 0 ONE OF THE MOST FUN ASPECTS OF CHEERLEADING IS THE INCORPORATION OF TUMBLING
G-ZeZ-O0joU_4 0 TUMBLING IS BASICALLY A FORM OF GYMNASTICS THAT THE GYMNASTS ARE DEMONSTRATING WHEN THEY DO THEIR FLOOR ROUTINES
G-ZeZ-O0joU_5 0 AS A CHEERLEADER IT'S IMPORTANT TO DEFINITELY HAVE SOME GYMNASTICS BACKGROUND IN YOUR TRAINING
G-ZeZ-O0joU_6 0 YOU CAN TAKE A CLASS IN YOUR COMMUNITY OR IF ONE IS OFFERED IN YOUR SCHOOL TO START OUT AND LEARN THE BASICS OF TUMBLING
G-ZeZ-O0joU_7 0 WHEN AND WHY DO WE USE TUMBLING IN CHEERLEADING
G-ZeZ-O0joU_8 0 TUMBLING IS A GREAT THING TO USE IN CHEERLEADING BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT NOT EVERYONE CAN DO
G-ZeZ-O0joU_9 0 IT USUALLY GETS THE CROWD PRETTY EXCITED
G-ZeZ-O0joU_10 0 THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT TUMBLES
G-ZeZ-O0joU_11 0 WE CAN INCORPORATE THEM INTO A CHEER
G-ZeZ-O0joU_12 0 WE CAN DO THEM DURING HALFTIMES AND TIMEOUTS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE USE TUMBLING TO SHOW OFF OUR SKILLS WHEN WE'RE DOING TUMBLING PASSAGES IN COMPETITION
G-ZeZ-O0joU_13 0 NO MATTER WHAT YOUR LEVEL OF TUMBLING IS AS BASIC A SOMERSAULT ALL THE WAY UP TO BACK FULLS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU INCORPORATE SOME TUMBLING INTO YOUR CHEERLEADING
Gy_c1fVrBQ4_1 0 HI I'M TOM CHOISNET ENROLLED AGENT THIS SECTION IS ABOUT CLUB DUES
Gy_c1fVrBQ4_2 0 AN EFFORT WAS MADE TO ELIMINATE CLUB DUES FROM BEING DEDUCTIBLE AT ALL AND THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF BACKLASH TO THE IRS ABOUT THAT
Gy_c1fVrBQ4_3 0 SO THEY HAVE COME UP WITH AN INTERESTING CONCLUSION CLUB DUES ARE NOT DEDUCTIBLE BY DEFINITION FOR SOCIAL ATHLETIC SPORTING AIRLINE AND HOTEL TYPE OF CLUBS BUT PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING KIWANIS AND ROTARY AND THOSE SORT OF ORGANIZATIONS
Gy_c1fVrBQ4_4 0 IF THE PRINCIPLE PURPOSE IS NOT FOR ENTERTAINMENT SO IT IS KIND OF AMBIGUOUS I THINK THAT THE REAL DIRECTION IS TO NOT ALLOW DEDUCTIONS FOR THINGS LIKE COUNTRY CLUBS AND YACHT CLUBS THINGS THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY PURELY ENTERTAINMENT
Gy_c1fVrBQ4_5 0 SO THAT IS THE LATEST WORD ON CLUB DUES
Gy_c1fVrBQ4_6 0 THANK YOU FOR WATCHING TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF MY OTHER SEGMENTS THANK YOU
GRjKa1aih8s_1 0 HI THIS IS MIKE LOPEZ WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'LL BE DISCUSSING THE RED MAGIC COLOR
GRjKa1aih8s_2 0 AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS THE CARD CALLED TARFIRE
GRjKa1aih8s_3 0 IT COSTS A RED WHICH ONCE AGAIN IS A CHEAP INSTANT BURN WHICH YOU WILL SEE A LOT IN THE RED DECK
GRjKa1aih8s_4 0 WE HAVE IT IS A COMMON TWENTY TWENTY-FIVE CENTS
GRjKa1aih8s_5 0 HERE WE HAVE DEAL TWO DAMAGE TO TARGET CREATURE OR PLAYER
GRjKa1aih8s_6 0 WHICH IS EXACTLY LIKE SHOCK AND BOLT AND SOME OF THE OTHER CARDS THAT YOU WILL SEE THAT ARE INSTANT DAMAGE
GRjKa1aih8s_7 0 NOW HERE'S WHERE IT DIFFERS
GRjKa1aih8s_8 0 FIRST THE NAME'S DIFFERENT SO YOU CAN PUT FOUR MORE IN YOUR DECK
GRjKa1aih8s_9 0 SO YOU COULD HAVE FOUR SHOCKS AND FOUR TARFIRES AND IN ESSENCE HAVE EIGHT INSTANT TWO DAMAGE HITTERS
GRjKa1aih8s_10 0 ALSO A NEW THING THAT HAS JUST COME OUT IS THAT THERE ARE NOW MULTIPLE NAMES ON THE CARDS
GRjKa1aih8s_11 0 THIS IS FROM THE LORWYN
GRjKa1aih8s_12 0 IT IS A TRIBAL INSTANT
GRjKa1aih8s_13 0 WHICH MEANS IT'S A TRIBAL INSTANT WHICH MEANS IT COUNTS AS A GOBLIN SPELL
GRjKa1aih8s_14 0 THEY HAVE THESE FOR ELVES ZOMBIES KITHKINS FOR ALL CREATURE TYPES
GRjKa1aih8s_15 0 THE REASON THAT THIS IS A LOT OF CREATURES SAY ON THEM THAT ANY TIME YOU OR AN OPPONENT PLAYS A SPELL OF A CERTAIN TYPE I.E
GRjKa1aih8s_16 0 GOBLIN MEANS GOBLIN CREATURE OR NOW GOBLIN INSTANT TRIBAL INSTANT THEN CERTAIN EFFECTS TAKE PLACE
GRjKa1aih8s_17 0 THAT'S WHY THIS CARD IS DIFFERENT AND WAS PUT INTO THE GAME

GkGNX7NtFX8_1 0 IN THIS SET OF VIDEOS WE'RE GOING TO EXPLORE STANDING SERIES POSES
GkGNX7NtFX8_2 0 THE BEST PLACE TO START FINDING MISALIGNMENTS IN YOUR BODY IS IN YOUR STANDING POSES

gUwTEZNfzHM_1 0 NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU TO CHOOSE YOUR AUTOMATION
gUwTEZNfzHM_2 0 WHEN GOING ONTO YOUR SCREEN YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT IN YOUR RANGE WINDOW PRESSING A WILL OPEN THE ACTUAL AUTOMATION VIEW
gUwTEZNfzHM_3 0 NOW JUST BECAUSE THE AUTOMATION VIEW IS ON DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY READING ANY TYPE OF AUTOMATION
gUwTEZNfzHM_4 0 WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO FIRST IS ACTUALLY TURN YOUR AUTOMATION TO READ TOUCH OR LATCH
gUwTEZNfzHM_5 0 NOW I EXPLAINED READ TOUCH LATCH AND WRITE SO WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS JUST BASICALLY PICK ONE OF THESE THAT YOU WANT TO DO
gUwTEZNfzHM_6 0 IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY RECORDING THE DATA LIKE WRITE WHEN YOU PLAY IT IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO LIKE YOU CAN ACTUALLY ADJUST IT WHILE IT'S PLAYING
gUwTEZNfzHM_7 0 NOW IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY READ IT YOU HAVE TO TURN IT TO READ
gUwTEZNfzHM_8 0 SO THIS BASICALLY IS GOING TO ACCEPT ANY TYPE OF DATA THAT YOU HAVE AND IT'S GOING TO LET IT PLAY BACK FOR YOU
gUwTEZNfzHM_9 0 SO IF YOU RECORD SOME TYPE OF VOLUME CHANGE THE READ IS GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO ACTUALLY HAVE THE VOLUME CHANGE OCCUR IN YOUR TRACK
GWYzrZwfq_M_2 0 THE DRINK WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE IS CALLED ABSOLUTELY SCREWED UP
GWYzrZwfq_M_3 0 AND PROBABLY HAS THAT NAME BECAUSE IT'S GOT A DECENT AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL IN IT
GWYzrZwfq_M_4 0 SO LET'S PUT SOME ICE IN A GLASS AND ON OUR HAND AND THE BAR AND THE FLOOR
GWYzrZwfq_M_5 0 AND DO ONE SHOT OF ABSOLUTE CITRON
GWYzrZwfq_M_6 0 OBVIOUSLY I'M A LITTLE BIT SCREWED UP MYSELF MAYBE I'VE HAD ONE OF THESE DRINKS YOU'LL NEVER KNOW
GWYzrZwfq_M_7 0 ONE SHOT OF TRIPLE SEC
GWYzrZwfq_M_8 0 AND ONE SHOT OF ORANGE JUICE
GWYzrZwfq_M_9 0 WE'LL GO AHEAD AND MEASURE IT OUT
GWYzrZwfq_M_11 0 AND WE'LL MIX THESE INGREDIENTS TOGETHER VIGOROUSLY

gG-6J8YPvig_1 0 OKAY TURNING THE BODY WHICH MEANS THIS
gG-6J8YPvig_2 0 SO YOU SEE HOW MY SHOULDER POINTS AT THE CAMERA
gG-6J8YPvig_3 0 THAT'S CALLED A BODY TURN SO NOW I'VE GOT MY BODY COILED AND WHEN I UNCOIL IT GENERATES A LOT OF POWER TO HIT THE GOLF BALL
gG-6J8YPvig_4 0 SO WHATEVER SPORT YOU PLAY WHETHER IT'S BASEBALL THROWING A FOOTBALL
gG-6J8YPvig_5 0 YOU SEE HOW THE BODY TURNS JUST TO THROW A BALL
gG-6J8YPvig_6 0 WHETHER YOU PLAY TENNIS YOU HAVE TO TURN THE BODY
gG-6J8YPvig_7 0 SO TURNING IS REALLY A KEY SKILL SO YOU WANT TO GET A GOOD HIP SHOULDER TURN BECAUSE THESE ARE THE BIG STRONG MUSCLES OF THE BODY NOT THE HANDS AND ARMS
gG-6J8YPvig_8 0 THE HANDS AND ARMS EVEN IF YOU'RE A BODY BUILDER THEY'RE RELATIVELY WEAK COMPARED TO THE TORSO AND THE LEGS
gG-6J8YPvig_9 0 SO I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT ONE WAY OF JUST KIND OF GETTING USE TO THE TURN IS TO TAKE YOUR DRIVER AND JUST KIND OF PUT IT LIKE THIS AND TURN
gG-6J8YPvig_10 0 OKAY SO THIS IS ABOUT HOW YOU SHOULD BE TURNED WHEN YOU HIT THE BALL
gG-6J8YPvig_11 0 SO THE HIP SHOULDER TURN IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GOING TO HIT THE BALL STRAIGHT TRUE AND FAR
gG-6J8YPvig_12 0 SO ONE OF THE BEST WAYS WE'VE COVERED THIS BEFORE BUT ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DEVELOP THIS TURN IS TO DO THE DRILL WITH YOUR FEET TOGETHER
gG-6J8YPvig_13 0 SO I WANT YOU TO FOCUS ON THAT AND IF YOU FOCUS ON THAT A LOT AND YOU'RE AWARE THAT YOU WANT TO GET THIS SHOULDER TURNING SO YOUR BACK IS FACING THE TARGET THEN YOU'LL START ON THE PATH TOWARD REALLY GETTING A GOOD CONSISTENT TURN AND YOUR DISTANCE YOUR POWER AND YOUR CONSISTENCY WILL IMPROVE DRAMATICALLY
HePfkV3d6X4_1 0 ALRIGHT THIS SERIES IS ABOUT JUGGLING CLUBS THREE CLUBS TO BE SPECIFIC
HePfkV3d6X4_2 0 I JUST WANTED TO TALK A SECOND ABOUT JUGGLING CLUBS
HePfkV3d6X4_3 0 WELL THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A JUGGLING CLUB IT'S NOT A BOWLING PIN MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER THEM TO BE SURPRISINGLY LIGHT
HePfkV3d6X4_4 0 I DON'T KNOW MOST PEOPLE I GUESS EXPECT THEM TO BE HEAVIER
HePfkV3d6X4_5 0 THEY'RE USUALLY MADE OF PLASTIC AND ALTHOUGH YOU CAN GET SOME OLD ONES THAT ARE MADE OUT OF WOOD THEY ARE MADE TO SPIN IN THE AIR
HePfkV3d6X4_6 0 YOU CAN HARDLY HELP THROW ONE OF THESE IN THE AIR WITHOUT IT NATURALLY SPINNING SO WHEN ATTEMPTING TO DO THESE TRICKS OR WHEN ATTEMPTING TO DO THAT KEEP THAT IN MIND
HePfkV3d6X4_7 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO PHYSICALLY SPIN IT WHEN YOU THROW IT IT PRETTY MUCH AUTOMATICALLY DOES IT
HePfkV3d6X4_8 0 AS FAR AS FLIGHT PATHS EVERYTHING IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO THREE BALL JUGGLING EXCEPT YOU HAVE THE ADDED COMPLEXITY OF THE CLUB SPINNING AND YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH THE RIGHT END
HePfkV3d6X4_9 0 SOME TRICKS DO INCLUDE CATCHING THE WRONG END BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO TOUCH ANY OF THOSE SO HERE WE GO HOW TO JUGGLE THREE CLUBS
g_Mprck4OsU_1 0 SO WE WOULD NOW START TO APPROACH GETTING ON
g_Mprck4OsU_2 0 AS I SLOWLY GO UP THE MOUNTING BLOCK REMEMBER TO KEEP A HOLD OF THE REINS
g_Mprck4OsU_3 0 SHE SEEMS VERY COMFORTABLE WITH ME
g_Mprck4OsU_4 0 WE ARE GOING TO KEEP THE REINS NOW IN THE LEFT HAND
g_Mprck4OsU_5 0 IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU KEEP THEM TIGHT
g_Mprck4OsU_6 0 YOU DO NOT WANT TO GET ON WITH THEM THIS LOOSE BECAUSE AS YOU ARE IN MID AIR IT WOULD BE VERY EASY FOR THEM TO TAKE OFF AND YOU CAN GET INTO SERIES TROUBLE
g_Mprck4OsU_7 0 SO SHORT SHORT REIN HOLDING WITH THE LEFT HAND
g_Mprck4OsU_8 0 THE RIGHT HAND IS GOING TO BE ON THE SADDLE THIS HAND IS GOING TO HELP YOU TO PUSH YOURSELF UP AND OVER
g_Mprck4OsU_9 0 YOUR LEFT FOOT IS GOING TO BE IN THE STIRRUP AND YOUR RIGHT LEG IS GOING TO COME OVER ONTO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HORSE
g_Mprck4OsU_10 0 IF AT THIS STAGE YOUR HORSE STARTS TO DANCE AROUND OR BE NERVOUS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU TAKE NOTE AND FIND SOMEONE TO ASSIST YOU
hAISKfe8_nM_2 0 THIS IS JOHN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
hAISKfe8_nM_3 0 IN THIS VIDEO CLIP I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT CHOOSING DRYWALL
hAISKfe8_nM_4 0 THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT CHOICES WHEN YOU CHOOSE DRYWALL
hAISKfe8_nM_5 0 THE DRYWALL THAT I HAVE CHOSEN FOR THIS PROJECT IS 5/8'S OF AN INCH THICK
hAISKfe8_nM_6 0 THEY ALSO SELL HALF INCH THICK AND 3/8'S INCH THICK DRYWALL
hAISKfe8_nM_7 0 THE REASON I CHOSE THE THICKER DRYWALL IS BECAUSE IT IS FOR A GARAGE WALL SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A CAR DOOR OPEN INTO THE DRYWALL
hAISKfe8_nM_8 0 WITH A THICKER DRYWALL IT IS LESS LIKELY TO PUT A HOLE THROUGH THE DRYWALL AND MORE LIKELY JUST TO PUT A DENT
hAISKfe8_nM_9 0 I HAVE ALSO CHOSEN A FIRE RESISTANT DRYWALL
hAISKfe8_nM_10 0 WHEN IT COMES TO FIRE YOU WANT ALL THE PROTECTION THAT YOU CAN HAVE
hAISKfe8_nM_11 0 IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE DRY WALLING IN A BATHROOM YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO USE A MOLD AND MILDEW RESISTANT DRYWALL
hAISKfe8_nM_12 0 IN ADDITION THERE ARE MANY OTHER TYPES OF DRYWALL FOR DIFFERENT AREAS THAT YOU ARE DRY WALLING
hAISKfe8_nM_13 0 LASTLY I'VE CHOSEN AN EIGHT FOOT SHEET OF DRYWALL BECAUSE MY WALLS ARE UNDER EIGHT FEET TALL
hAISKfe8_nM_14 0 IT WOULDN'T BE VERY SMART TO BUY A TWELVE FOOT SECTION AND JUST HAVE TO CUT OFF FOUR FEET OF IT
gdtbeY84CPM_1 0 I'M JUDY FRANCK FOR EXPERTVILLAGE
gdtbeY84CPM_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING SOME NAIL ART TODAY
gdtbeY84CPM_3 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO HEAD AND DO OUR PALM TREES
gdtbeY84CPM_4 0 WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS I LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT I'VE GOT THE SMALLEST BRUSH I'VE GOT
gdtbeY84CPM_5 0 I'D LIKE EVEN SMALLER THAN THAT SOMETIMES FOR WHAT I'M DOING
gdtbeY84CPM_6 0 I GO A HEAD GET MY PAINT BRUSH WET GET MY BLACK I DO LIKE THE BLACK TO DO A PALM TREE JUST BECAUSE IT REALLY HAS A NICE CONTRAST WITH THE OTHER COLORS THAT I'M DOING
gdtbeY84CPM_7 0 SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE YOUR PAINT BRUSH STAYS IN A NICE POINT
gdtbeY84CPM_8 0 IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TELL WITH BLACK BECAUSE YOUR PAINT BRUSH BEING BLACK IT IS HARDER TO TELL HOW MUCH PAINT YOU'VE GOT ON THERE
gdtbeY84CPM_9 0 YOU MAY HAVE TO GO TRIAL AND ERROR
gdtbeY84CPM_10 0 THIS IS THE POINT WHERE YOU NEED TO ALSO BE SURE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY WATER FALLING OUT OF THE SHAFT OF YOUR BRUSH
gdtbeY84CPM_11 0 TAKE YOU PAINT AND ROLL IT A LITTLE BIT ON THE EDGE OF YOUR TOWEL WHATEVER YOU'RE USING TO DAB WITH AND GIVE YOUR WATER A CHANCE TO FALL OUT
gdtbeY84CPM_12 0 IF THERE IS WATER IN THERE THIS IS WHEN IT WILL FALL OUT WHEN YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING DETAILED
gdtbeY84CPM_13 0 SO GO A HEAD AND START WITH A STRAIGHT LINE TO DO YOUR PALM TREES
gdtbeY84CPM_14 0 THEN WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS START PUTTING YOUR BRANCHES ON HERE PALMS FERNS WHATEVER THEY'RE CALLED JUST GET THAT GOING
gdtbeY84CPM_15 0 JUST A NICE LITTLE SWEEPING MOTION
gdtbeY84CPM_16 0 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE WHAT I'M DOING HERE PROBABLY BLOCKING YOU FROM SEEING THIS
gdtbeY84CPM_17 0 YOU JUST WANT TO KEEP YOUR BRANCHES REAL THIN IF YOU CAN AND TRY REALLY CAREFULLY NOT TO MAKE IT A BIG BLOB BECAUSE IF YOU DO TOO MUCH PAINT ON THERE YOU'RE GOING NOT HAVE VERY MUCH DETAIL
gdtbeY84CPM_18 0 OUR SURFER GUY IS GOING TO BE ON THIS THUMB
gdtbeY84CPM_19 0 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE BUT I'M ROLLING MY BRUSH AROUND IN THE PAINT TOO TO TRY AND GET A NICE POINT ON IT BECAUSE MY SURFER GUY IS GOING TO HAVE SPIKEY HAIR
g7fTzX2zqHs_1 0 THIS IS MAYLEE AND UNFORTUNATELY MAYLEE IS AN EXAMPLE OF A CAT WHO DOES NOT GROOM HERSELF VERY WELL SO SHE WILL HAVE A COMPLETE VETERINARY CHECK UP TO FIND OUT IF THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG THAT MAY KEEP HER FROM GROOMING PROPERLY
g7fTzX2zqHs_2 0 ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE WOULD LOOK AT IS TO CHECK HER TEETH TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY DAMAGED OR INFECTED TEETH THAT MIGHT BE CAUSING HER TO NOT WANT TO USE HER MOUTH TO GROOM
g7fTzX2zqHs_3 0 WE WOULD ALSO WANT TO CHECK HER FEET AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO INJURIES TO HER TOES THAT MAY CAUSE HER TO NOT WANT TO USE HER FEET TO GROOM PROPERLY
g7fTzX2zqHs_4 0 AS YOU CAN SEE BACK HERE MAYLEE'S FUR IS ALL CLUMPED AND MATTED TOGETHER
g7fTzX2zqHs_5 0 IN A NORMAL CAT LIKE IN OUR PREVIOUS SEGMENT WITH T.J HIS COAT WAS NICE AND SOFT AND SMOOTH ALL AROUND AND MAYLEE HAS ALL THESE LITTLE MATS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN OFF AND ATTENDED TO AND LATER ON IN THIS SERIES WE'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THESE MATS SO MAYLEE IS PROBABLY SHE IS ALSO A LITTLE THIN SO SHE MAY NOT BE GROOMING JUST BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN SICK IN THE PAST
ggkZhlitHTk_1 0 HI MY NAME IS SUE CONRAD AND I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE HOW TO DO A PULL UP
ggkZhlitHTk_2 0 A PULL UP IS A GOOD UPPER BODY WORKOUT
ggkZhlitHTk_3 0 IT REQUIRES A LOT OF UPPER BODY STRENGTH THAT MANY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE SO I WILL ALSO BE SHOWING SOME MODIFICATIONS TO THIS EXERCISE FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE A LITTLE BIT UPPER BODILY CHALLENGED
ggkZhlitHTk_4 0 THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT GRIPS AS WELL I MEAN YOU CAN DO AN OVERHAND GRIP UNDERHAND GRIP AND A WIDE GRIP DEPENDING ON WHAT APPARATUS YOU'RE USING FOR YOUR PULL UP
ggkZhlitHTk_5 0 I'M GOING TO START WITH AN UNDERHAND GRIP AND IF YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT SHORTER YOU MAY NEED SOME ASSISTANCE GETTING UP
ggkZhlitHTk_6 0 SO YOU CAN USE A CHAIR OR WHATEVER'S AVAILABLE
ggkZhlitHTk_7 0 START UP AND THEN PULL YOUR BODY DOWN
ggkZhlitHTk_8 0 WHEN YOU'RE DOING YOUR PULL UPS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KEEP YOUR BACK NICE AND STRAIGHT SHOULDERS RELAXED AND YOU WANT TO TRY YOUR BEST NOT TO SWING
ggkZhlitHTk_9 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO USE MOMENTUM BRINGING YOU UP TO THE BAR SO IF YOU NEED SOME EXTRA ASSISTANCE YOU CAN HAVE SOMEONE HOLD YOUR FEET AND HELP SLIGHTLY PUSH YOU UP AND ELEVATE YOU OR YOU COULD HAVE A CHAIR UNDERNEATH LIKE HALFWAY DOWN SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE GROUND FOR YOUR PULL UP POSITION
ggkZhlitHTk_10 0 SO THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN HAVE YOUR GRIP
ggkZhlitHTk_11 0 YOU CAN HAVE UNDERHAND OVERHAND WIDE GRIP CLOSE GRIP AND WITH SOME PULL UP BARS YOU CAN EVEN HOLD YOUR HANDS AT THE SIDES
ggkZhlitHTk_12 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO WORK YOUR UPPER BODY MUSCLES AT DIFFERENT ANGLES AND BENEFIT INCREASING YOUR UPPER BODY STRENGTH

hG_QKd-y7ps_3 0 IN THIS VIDEO CLIP I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT MAINTAINING SAFE TOOL CONTROL
hG_QKd-y7ps_4 0 BEFORE YOU GET STARTED YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR WORK PIECE IS FREE OF ANY NAILS OR SCREWS OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF METAL OBJECTS
hG_QKd-y7ps_5 0 RUNNING THE TOOL INTO THEM COULD CAUSE THE TOOL TO JUMP OR IT COULD SHOOT OUT SOME SPARKS WHICH COULD IGNITE ANY COMBUSTIBLES OR DUST IN THE AIR SO YOU REALLY WANT TO BE CAREFUL BEFORE YOU GET STARTED
hG_QKd-y7ps_6 0 YOU NEVER WANT TO HOLD YOUR WORK PIECE WITH ONE HAND AND OPERATE THE TOOL WITH THE OTHER HAND
hG_QKd-y7ps_7 0 INSTEAD YOU ALWAYS WANT TO CLAMP THE MATERIAL DOWN AND USE BOTH HANDS ON THE TOOL
hG_QKd-y7ps_8 0 LASTLY YOU NEVER WANT TO CUT WHEN THERE IS A HARD SURFACE BEHIND YOUR WORK PIECE BECAUSE YOU NEED THAT ROOM FOR THE BIT WHEN IT PROTRUDES THROUGH THE BACK SIDE OF IT
G_RBc1T9Ji4_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS LIZBETH MULLER FROM LIZ'S HAIR DESIGN IN HOLLYWOOD FLORIDA AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO CUT CURLY HAIR

g6rXYY0_dy0_1 0 ALRIGHT SO NOW WE'VE LEARNED THE LIFT UP WITH OUR SECOND HAND LET'S LEARN HOW TO DROP THE HOOP DOWN WITH THE SECOND HAND
g6rXYY0_dy0_2 0 ROTATE THE HOOP FROM THE RIGHT HAND TO THE LEFT OR FIRST TO SECOND HAND
g6rXYY0_dy0_3 0 AS THE HOOP IS SPINNING NOTICE WHEN THE PRESSES AGAINST THE PALM OF YOUR HAND
g6rXYY0_dy0_4 0 WHEN THE HOOP PRESSES AGAINST THE PALM OF YOUR HAND THAT'S WHEN YOU CAN SLOWLY OR QUICKLY DROP THE HOOP DOWN TO YOUR WAIST
g6rXYY0_dy0_5 0 YOU'RE GOING TO DROP IT DOWN RIGHT BEHIND YOUR LEFT HIP THAT'S WHERE IT'S GOING TO CONNECT FIRST
g6rXYY0_dy0_6 0 SO ONCE AGAIN UP IN YOUR LEFT HAND OR SECOND HAND AS THE HOOP SPINS FEEL THE HOOP PRESSING INTO THE PALM OF YOUR HAND

HK7491w4XC8_1 0 IN THIS NEXT CLIP WE'RE GOING TO BE LEARNING HOW TO HOLD THE KAMAS
HK7491w4XC8_2 0 OKAY IF YOU HAVE KARMAS LIKE MINE THE EXTREME KAMAS AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PADDING IN THE MIDDLE
HK7491w4XC8_3 0 FIRST OF ALL MAKE SURE THEY'RE WEIGHTED OKAY
HK7491w4XC8_4 0 SO THESE ONES ARE WEIGHTED
HK7491w4XC8_5 0 IF YOU GOT SOME THAT WON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TYPE OF WEIGHT THEY'LL BE TOO HEAVY OR TOO LIGHT
HK7491w4XC8_6 0 YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME WITH ABOUT A MEDIUM WEIGHT JUST ONLY REALLY A FEW OUNCES
HK7491w4XC8_7 0 BUT SOMETIMES HEAVIER JUST DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU LIKE
HK7491w4XC8_8 0 YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRY THEM OUT
HK7491w4XC8_9 0 OKAY SO MORE TRADITIONAL KAMAS THEY'LL HOLD THEM DOWN HERE AT THE BOTTOM LIKE THIS
HK7491w4XC8_10 0 AND THEY USE REALLY TO USE THIS WEIGHT UP HERE THE BLADE WILL BE HEAVY FOR STRIKING
HK7491w4XC8_13 0 THAT'S WHERE YOU WANT TO HOLD IT
HK7491w4XC8_14 0 BUT THESE ONES WE'RE GOING TO DO FAST SPINS AND STRIKES
HK7491w4XC8_15 0 YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO HOLD IT RIGHT HERE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
HK7491w4XC8_16 0 RIGHT WHERE THAT GRIP IS
HK7491w4XC8_17 0 WE'RE GOING TO HOLD IT RIGHT ABOVE THE TOP
HK7491w4XC8_18 0 OKAY IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GRIP YOU DON'T WANT TO HOLD IT AT THE VERY TOP OR THE MIDDLE
HK7491w4XC8_19 0 YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR HAND RIGHT WHERE THE MIDDLE IS AND YOU'RE GOING TO USE MOSTLY USE YOUR TWO FINGERS FOR PINCHING WHEN YOU DO SPINS AND STRIKES
HK7491w4XC8_20 0 SO ALWAYS RIGHT THERE
HK7491w4XC8_21 0 YOU'RE GOING TO DO DIFFERENT TYPES OF SPINS
HK7491w4XC8_22 0 YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE YOUR HAND UP AND DOWN THE KAMAS
HK7491w4XC8_23 0 SO ALWAYS CHECK AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE HOLDING THE RIGHT POSITION
HK7491w4XC8_24 0 AND YOU WANT BOTH HANDS EXACTLY THE SAME WHEN YOU'RE DOING YOUR KAMAS
HK7491w4XC8_25 0 SO HOLDING IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE HOLDING IT IN THE CORRECT POSITIONING SO IT WILL BE WEIGHTED SO YOU CAN DO THE PROPER SPINS AND THE PROPER CHOPS FOR YOUR EXTREME KAMA FORM
g6Nk9SdgLWc_1 0 YOU KNOW AS IMPORTANT AS DEFENSE IS YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE OPTIONS YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE JUST ONE
g6Nk9SdgLWc_2 0 ONE IMPORTANT DEFENSE THAT YOU CAN USE IS THE ONE THREE ONE
g6Nk9SdgLWc_3 0 HI I'M TRAVIS AND THIS IS A ONE THREE ONE DEFENSE
g6Nk9SdgLWc_4 0 WHEN YOU'RE SETTING UP A ONE THREE ONE FIRST OF ALL YOU WANT TO SET IT UP WHERE YOUR POINT GUARD IS AT THE TOP OF THE KEY AROUND THIS AREA
g6Nk9SdgLWc_5 0 NOW DEPENDING ON HOW DEPENDING ON THE OFFENSE THAT THEY'RE PLAYING AND HOW EFFECTIVE THAT OFFENSE IS THAT WILL DETERMINE HOW FAR YOUR POINT GUARD WILL GO OUT
g6Nk9SdgLWc_6 0 NOW IF THE TEAM THAT'S NOT REALLY SHOOTING A LOT OF JUMP SHOTS AND THEY'RE NOT REALLY HITTING A LOT OF JUMP SHOTS AND THEY'RE REALLY PENETRATING THE PAINT YOU MIGHT WANT TO PACK IT IN A LITTLE BIT
g6Nk9SdgLWc_7 0 YOUR POINT GUARD MIGHT WANT TO COME DOWN AND BE INSIDE HERE
g6Nk9SdgLWc_8 0 ONCE YOU GET BUT THAT'S THAT POINT GUARDS AREA THIS IS ALL OF HIS AREA HIS OR HER AREA
g6Nk9SdgLWc_9 0 THEY'LL PLAY ANYTHING UP HERE THIS IS THEIR SPOT
g6Nk9SdgLWc_10 0 THEN YOU'LL HAVE THE THREE WHICH IS YOUR SECOND DEFENSE YOUR THREE IN THE MIDDLE
g6Nk9SdgLWc_11 0 SO YOU'LL HAVE THE POINT GUARD UP TOP YOU'LL HAVE A FORWARD RIGHT HERE A CENTER WILL BE A LITTLE FURTHER BACK BUT WHAT YOU'LL HAVE IS YOU'LL HAVE A SMALL FORWARD HERE YOU'LL HAVE THE SHOOTING GUARD ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SUPPORT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEFENSE
g6Nk9SdgLWc_12 0 SO YOU'LL HAVE A SMALL FORWARD POWER FORWARD ALONG THE MIDDLE AND YOU'LL HAVE THE SHOOTING GUARD ON THE OTHER SIDE
g6Nk9SdgLWc_13 0 NOW YOU MAY OR MAY NOT WANT THE OUTSIDE PLAYERS THE FORWARD AND THE SHOOTING GUARD TO MOVE UP A LITTLE BIT THAT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU WANT TO RUN IT
g6Nk9SdgLWc_14 0 BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE PREMISE AND EACH OF THOSE WILL HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GETTING ANYTHING THAT COMES IN THAT PAINT
g6Nk9SdgLWc_15 0 THE FORWARD ACTUALLY SMALL FORWARD WILL HAVE THIS RESPONSIBILITY OUT HERE ANYTHING BEYOND THAT POINT GUARDS REACH IS ON THIS SIDE OF THE COURT WILL BE THAT SMALL FORWARDS RESPONSIBILITY
g6Nk9SdgLWc_16 0 ON THE OTHER SIDE SAME THING WITH THE SHOOTING GUARD ANYTHING OVER THERE PAST THE POINT GUARD WILL BE THAT SHOOTING GUARDS RESPONSIBILITY
g6Nk9SdgLWc_17 0 NOW IF IT GETS PAST THIS SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE THEN BACK HERE YOU'LL HAVE THE CENTER WHICH IS AGAIN THE CENTER WILL BE THE ONE THAT HOLDS THE PAINT DOWN AND IS IN THE MIDDLE ANYTHING THAT GETS PAST THAT LINE OF DEFENSE IS HIS OR HER RESPONSIBILITY
g6Nk9SdgLWc_18 0 THERE YOU HAVE IT A ONE THREE ONE DEFENSE
_GtKZbzWBig_1 0 ALICE MONSAERT THIS EXERCISE IS GOING TO TARGET THE PECTORALIS MAJOR THE LATS THE DELTOIDS AS WELL AS THE STABILITY OF HOLDING YOURSELF INTO THAT BRIDGE POSITION
_GtKZbzWBig_2 0 SO HOLD ON TO THE BALL AS YOU SLOWLY WALK YOURSELF OUT
_GtKZbzWBig_3 0 AGAIN IN THIS POSITION YOU WANT TO LET GET YOUR HEAD RESTING ON THE BALL AND NOT LET YOUR HIPS SAG SO YOU'RE GOING TO USE THE GLUTES TO CONTRACT TO LIFT THE HIPS AND HAVE YOUR HEAD IN LINE WITH YOUR SPINE
_GtKZbzWBig_4 0 I'M GOING TO TAKE THE WEIGHTS NOW AND LIFT
_GtKZbzWBig_5 0 WE'RE GOING OVER THE HEAD AND PULLING BACK OVER THE CHEST
_GtKZbzWBig_6 0 SO I'M EXTENDING OVER THE HEAD AND IN THIS ACTION HERE IS WHEN THE LATS ARE GOING TO KICK IN WHICH ARE THE LARGE MUSCLES OF THE BACK AND ALSO THE PECTORALIS MAJOR
_GtKZbzWBig_7 0 SO I'M EXPANDING THE CHEST
_GtKZbzWBig_8 0 WHAT I DON'T WANT TO HAPPEN IS LETTING THE RIBCAGE POP UP
_GtKZbzWBig_9 0 SO THINK ABOUT TUCKING THAT RIBCAGE DOWN SQUEEZING UP WITH THE GLUTES AND THE HAMSTRINGS FINDING YOURSELF STABLE ON THE BALL EXTENDING THE ARMS OVER
_GtKZbzWBig_10 0 AND HERE YOU CAN ALSO CHANGE THAT SO THAT YOU COULD ADD A TRICEPS PRESS OR A COMBINATION OF TRICEPS WITH THAT OVERHEAD PRESS TARGETING SEVERAL MUSCLE GROUPS
_GtKZbzWBig_11 0 THE TRICEPS OBVIOUSLY THIS INCORPORATES THE BACK OF THE ARM
_GtKZbzWBig_12 0 TO GET OUT OF THIS BRING THE WEIGHTS DOWN DROP THE HIPS LIFT THE HEAD AND WALK YOURSELF BACK UP ON THE BALL

gljUBiQSXec_7 0 THESE TWO CARDS MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED OR IT MIGHT BE A DARK WORLD DEALINGS OR IT MIGHT BE LIGHTNING VORTEX
gljUBiQSXec_8 0 THE GOOD THING ABOUT POT OF AVARICE IS THAT YOU DRAW TWO CARDS SO IF YOU DRAW POT OF AVARICE AND YOU HAD NO CARDS BEFORE YOU'LL STILL BE DRAWING ONE MORE CARD THAT YOU CAN THEN USE TO USE LIGHTNING VORTEX
gljUBiQSXec_9 0 OR YOU COULD DRAW DARK WORLD DEALINGS
gljUBiQSXec_10 0 YOU'LL HAVE TWO CARDS TO USE WITH IT
gljUBiQSXec_11 0 YOU WON'T HAVE TO PRAY OR HOPE OR WISH FOR A DARK WORLD MONSTER OFF THE TOP OF YOUR DECK

GxoOLDW0Ndg_2 0 THE WEAVE INCORPORATES CROSSING AND SPINNING IN A WHOLE NEW WAY THAT INITIALLY MAY SEEM VERY HARD BUT IF YOU HAVE THESE BASIC THINGS DOWN IT WILL MAKE THE NEXT LESSON MUCH EASIER
GxoOLDW0Ndg_3 0 SO DON'T BE AFRAID TO SPEND SOME TIME LEARNING THESE FUNDAMENTALS BEFORE YOU GO ON AND REMEMBER IT DOES TAKE SOME TIME TO DEVELOP THESE SKILLS
GxoOLDW0Ndg_4 0 DON'T BE DISCOURAGED IF IN THE FIVE OR TEN MINUTES THAT YOU ARE WATCHING THIS YOU CAN'T DO SOME OF THESE THINGS AS WELL AS ME
GxoOLDW0Ndg_5 0 TAKE THE TIME TO PRACTICE EACH DAY AND IF YOU HIT YOURSELF AND IF YOU DROP YOUR POI IF YOU FEEL LIKE A TOTAL KLUTZ IT IS O'KAY
GxoOLDW0Ndg_6 0 IT IS ALL PART OF THE FUN AND IT'S ALL PART OF JUST LEARNING AND HUMBLING YOURSELF TO LEARN A NEW SKILL

GsOFfngdAkA_6 0 WE HAVE MERIDIANS INSIDE OF OUR BODY THAT IF THE QI DOESN'T FLOW PROPERLY THROUGHOUT THE BODY THAT IS WHERE THE BELIEF THAT SICKNESS AND ILL HEALTH SETS IN
GsOFfngdAkA_7 0 SO BY DOING QIGONG WE LEARN TO MOVE THE BODY ALONG WITH MOVING THE ENERGY INSIDE OF US SO THAT WE CAN UNBLOCK THOSE AREAS THAT TEND TO ARE SLOW IN QI OR END UP BEING BLOCKED BY THE FLOW OF ENERGY
GsOFfngdAkA_8 0 AND ONCE THAT ENERGY IS BLOCKED THEN THE SICKNESS IS BELIEVED TO SET IN
GsOFfngdAkA_9 0 SO BY DOING MOVEMENTS WITH OUR BREATHING AND OUR CONNECTION OF THE MIND BODY AND OUR SPIRIT WE CAN GAIN MUCH BETTER HEALTH BECAUSE AS WE KNOW IN TODAY'S SOCIETY A LOT OF US ARE UNDER A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STRESS
GsOFfngdAkA_10 0 AND STRESS IS A MAJOR FACTOR IN ILLNESS
GsOFfngdAkA_11 0 IT HAS BEEN PROVEN MANY TIMES OVER THAT STRESS CAN CAUSE MAN MANY SICKNESSES
GsOFfngdAkA_12 0 AND BY DOING QIGONG WE CAN ALLEVIATE STRESS AND CURE SOME OF THE AILMENTS THAT WE FACE OUT THERE
GsOFfngdAkA_13 0 HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE DIABETES QIGONG HAS EVEN BEEN KNOWN TO EVEN HELP WITH THE REMISSION OF CANCER

GMbQA-37MoY_2 0 I'M CAROL ANN WITH STUDIO GROUP X AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO A FRONT RAISE USING THE BARBELL
GMbQA-37MoY_3 0 SO ONE THING YOU NEED TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT YOUR SHOULDERS ARE VERY TINY MUSCLES SO YOU DON'T WANT TO OVERLOAD YOUR BAR BECAUSE YOU WANT TO WORK TO WHERE YOU CAN GET IT A FATIGUE ANYWHERE BETWEEN TEN TO FIFTEEN REPS BUT WITHOUT STRAINING YOUR BACK
GMbQA-37MoY_4 0 SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS COME INTO A T STAND OR YOU CAN COME INTO HIP-WIDTH APART
GMbQA-37MoY_5 0 KEEP YOUR SPINE IN NEUTRAL POSITION BY ENGAGING YOUR ABDOMINAL MUSCLES
GMbQA-37MoY_6 0 NOW YOU'RE GOING TO GRADUALLY AND GENTLY LIFT THE BAR UP IN FRONT OF YOU BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO GO ABOVE SHOULDER HEIGHT
GMbQA-37MoY_7 0 JUST COME TO YOUR SHOULDERS AND LOWER DOWN
GMbQA-37MoY_8 0 EXHALE AS YOU LIFT INHALE AS YOU LOWER DOWN
GMbQA-37MoY_9 0 NOW IF YOU'RE SWINGING YOUR BODY YOU'VE GOT TOO MUCH WEIGHT
GMbQA-37MoY_10 0 YOU WANT TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN CONTROL HERE
GMbQA-37MoY_11 0 YOU CAN GO UP FOR A COUNT OF TWO DOWN FOR A COUNT OF TWO
GMbQA-37MoY_12 0 YOU CAN GO SUPER SLOW FOR A COUNT OF FOUR SUPER SLOW DOWN FOR A COUNT OF FOUR
GMbQA-37MoY_13 0 YOU CAN GO UP QUICK ON ONE DOWN SLOW ON THREE OR YOU CAN GO UP SLOW ON A COUNT OF THREE AND DOWN QUICK ON ONE AND THEN YOU CAN DO SINGLES
GMbQA-37MoY_14 0 NOW WHEN YOU'RE DOING SINGLES YOU HAVE A TENDENCY TO KIND OF ROCK THE BODY SO YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT
GMbQA-37MoY_15 0 YOU WANT TO KEEP IT NICE AND SMOOTH AND IN CONTROL
GMbQA-37MoY_16 0 NOW IF YOU'RE USING ALL THOSE VARIED RHYTHMS YOU CAN ESSENTIALLY DO THAT FOR FOUR MINUTES OR IF YOU LIKE TO COUNT YOU CAN DO THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT THAT IT TAKES FOR YOU TO DO TEN TO FIFTEEN REPS THREE SETS
GMbQA-37MoY_17 0 AND THAT'S YOUR FRONT RAISE USING THE BARBELL
GMbQA-37MoY_18 0 I'M CAROL ANN WITH STUDIO GROUP X
GMbQA-37MoY_19 0 ALL RIGHT THOSE ANTERIOR DELTS YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK GOOD
gpmDwh1reuo_1 0 ALLYN CHRISTOPHER BEFORE WE CAN START PUTTING NEW PARTS IN WE'VE GOTTA TAKE THE OLD PARTS OUT AND START TO BREAK THEM DOWN
gpmDwh1reuo_2 0 SO THIS IS KIND OF A SEQUENCE YOU CAN USE TO GO THROUGH TO STRIP THE OLD GUY DOWN AND BEGIN BRINGING HER BACK UP
gpmDwh1reuo_3 0 FIRST THING FLOAT HEAD
gpmDwh1reuo_4 0 NOW YOU WANT TO GENTLY UNSCREW IT A LITTLE BIT OF PULL PRESSURE AS YOU DO THAT ALL RIGHT BECAUSE THIS PIECE RIGHT OVER HERE ON THE MAST YOU DON'T WANT TO BREAK ALL RIGHT
gpmDwh1reuo_5 0 IF YOU DO THEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CUTTING AND EPOXYING
gpmDwh1reuo_6 0 THEY DO MAKE A REPLACEMENT PIECE BUT GOSH THIS IS A THAT'S SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN
gpmDwh1reuo_7 0 SO IF YOU JUST GENTLE AND YOU'RE PULLING IT OUT THERE IT GOES
gpmDwh1reuo_8 0 NOW A LOT OF TIMES YEAH YOU CAN HEAR WATER INSIDE OF THIS
gpmDwh1reuo_9 0 YOU CAN'T SQUEEZE AND GET IT OUT I DON'T KNOW HOW IT GETS IN THERE BUT ONE OF THE WAYS TO KILL THIS IS TO HAVE IT FULL OF WATER AND SINCE THEY'RE TO COUNTERACT THE WEIGHT OF THE CLEANER HAVING IT FULL OF WATER IS NOT A GREAT BALLAST IDEA
gpmDwh1reuo_10 0 SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO GET RID OF IT
gpmDwh1reuo_11 0 AND IN THIS CASE HERE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE TAIL OFF
gpmDwh1reuo_12 0 SWEEP TAIL ACTUALLY DOES A LOT OF WORK FOR THE CLEANER BUT IT'S BROKEN
gpmDwh1reuo_13 0 SO NOW NORMALLY I'D BE TELLING YOU HOW TO TAKE OFF THE ATTACHMENT CLAMP HERE SINCE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BROKEN AND MISSING WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT
gpmDwh1reuo_14 0 AGAIN DON'T BREAK THE NIPPLE THAT IT'S ATTACHED TO JUST EASE HER OFF
gpmDwh1reuo_15 0 I'M GOING TO PUT THIS ASIDE SO I'LL SHOW YOU WHY IT'S BROKEN LATER
gpmDwh1reuo_16 0 AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GET A LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO THE CLEANER
GP26EIR1bas_1 0 NOW ONE NEAT LITTLE TRICK THAT I USE SOMETIMES ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M PRINTING WITH A FIBER BASED PAPER ARE THE TIMES IN WHICH I DEVELOP MY PRINT AT
GP26EIR1bas_2 0 NOW THERE ARE DIFFERENT TIMES FOR RC PAPER AND FOR FIBER PAPER
GP26EIR1bas_3 0 THAT'S ONE WAY THAT THE FIBER BASED PAPER IS A LITTLE BIT SLOWER TO WORK WITH
GP26EIR1bas_4 0 BUT I SORT OF LIKE IT BECAUSE I CAN DEVELOP MY FIBER BASED PAPER ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO FIVE MINUTES
GP26EIR1bas_5 0 AND THEREFORE I CAN SORT OF MANIPULATE THE WAY THAT PRINT LOOKS
GP26EIR1bas_6 0 I CAN MANIPULATE IT MUCH EASIER THAN I CAN MANIPULATE MY RC PRINT
GP26EIR1bas_7 0 AND ANOTHER THING THAT I CAN DO WITH THE FIBER BASED PAPER IS I CAN USE TWO DEVELOPERS
GP26EIR1bas_8 0 I CAN USE A DECTOL AND A SELECTOL
GP26EIR1bas_9 0 THE DECTOL'S ARE A COLD CONTRASTY DEVELOPER AND THE SELECTOL'S A VERY WARM DEVELOPER
GP26EIR1bas_10 0 SO IN A WAY I'M GETTING THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS USING THOSE TWO DIFFERENT DEVELOPERS
GP26EIR1bas_11 0 NOW IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE TO USE TWO DIFFERENT DEVELOPERS BUT SOMETIMES PRICE IS DEFINITELY WORTH WHAT YOUR FINAL OUTCOME OF YOUR PRINT IS

HbN4HirlD3k_1 0 HI MY NAME IS ELLA SELTZER FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
HbN4HirlD3k_2 0 NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO ADD THE LOBSTER CLASP ONTO THE END OF YOUR BRACELET
HbN4HirlD3k_3 0 ONCE AGAIN YOU'RE GOING TO ADD A CRIMP TUBE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRACELET CUTTING OFF THE EXCESS CHAIN
HbN4HirlD3k_4 0 AND THEN ADDING IN A JUMP RING AND THEN YOU SLIP THE LOBSTER CLASP ONTO THE JUMP RING AND CLOSE IT WITH YOUR TWO PAIRS OF PLIERS
HbN4HirlD3k_5 0 I JUST WANT TO ADD AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF ADVICE CONCERNING LENGTHS OF BRACELETS AND NOT MAKING A BRACELET TOO BIG OR TOO SMALL
HbN4HirlD3k_6 0 YOU HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THE IN THIS SPECIFIC EXAMPLE AND MANY OTHER THINGS YOU MIGHT MAKE THE CLASP PLUS THE JUMP RING PLUS THE OTHER JUMP RING ADD TWO AND A HALF CENTIMETERS ONTO YOUR BRACELET
HbN4HirlD3k_7 0 SO IF YOU ARE WORKING ON YOUR BRACELET AND YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS IT GOING TO BE TOO BIG
HbN4HirlD3k_8 0 IS IT GOING TO BE TOO SMALL
HbN4HirlD3k_9 0 YOU WANT IT TO GO AROUND YOUR WRIST AND KNOW THAT WHEN YOU ADD TWO AND A HALF CENTIMETERS ONTO IT IT'S STILL GOING TO BE A GOOD SIZE IT'S NOT GOING TO TOO BIG AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE TOO SMALL
HbN4HirlD3k_10 0 IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF TRIAL AND ERROR
HbN4HirlD3k_11 0 ONCE YOU HAVE OR UNLESS YOU HAVE A BRACELET THAT ALREADY FITS YOU PERFECTLY AND YOU CAN MEASURE IT UP AGAINST THAT BRACELET
HbN4HirlD3k_12 0 BUT EVERYBODY HAS A DIFFERENT WRIST SIZE AND SO THEREFORE I CAN'T GIVE ANY SPECIFIC EXACT GUIDELINES AS TO WHAT LENGTH THE BRACELET SHOULD BE
hAVCtWOLuDQ_2 0 SO TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO BUILD A BUNRAKU A JAPANESE BUNRAKU PUPPET STYLE WRIST CONTROL
hAVCtWOLuDQ_3 0 WHAT THIS CONTRAPTION ALLOWS A PUPPETEER TO DO WHEN INSERTED INTO A PUPPET
hAVCtWOLuDQ_4 0 AND I'M GOING TO USE RUFUS HERE RUFUS IS A MARIONETTE BUT HE CAN HELP OUT FOR OUR PURPOSES IS CONTROL THE UP DOWN MOVEMENT OF THE HAND
hAVCtWOLuDQ_5 0 THE WAY THE CONTROL WORKS IS THE FIRST PART OF THE ROD REPRESENTS THE FOREARM OF THE PUPPET
hAVCtWOLuDQ_6 0 AND THEN THIS LITTLE DOOHICKEY IS JUST STANDING IN FOR A HAND
hAVCtWOLuDQ_7 0 THE PUPPETEER GRASPS THE GRIP ROTATES THE TOGGLE AND IT MOVES THE HAND WITH THIS PIECE OF BUNGEE CORD MARKING THE ELBOW OF THE PUPPET
hAVCtWOLuDQ_8 0 BUNRAKU IS A THREE HUNDRED OR MORE YEAR OLD JAPANESE PUPPET TRADITION
hAVCtWOLuDQ_9 0 INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL TWO TO EVEN FIVE FOOT TALL PUPPETS ARE MANIPULATED BY TWO ONE TWO OR THREE PERFORMERS DRESSED IN BLACK AND VISIBLE OVERTLY ON THE STAGE
hAVCtWOLuDQ_10 0 FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT BUNRAKU THAT'S B-U-N-R-A-K-U PUPPETRY YOU CAN LOOK AT THE PUPPETEERS OF AMERICA HOMEPAGE
hIIw2GHVA1o_1 0 ALL RIGHT GOOD FATS BAD FATS WHAT'S THE SKINNY ON FATS
hIIw2GHVA1o_2 0 WELL IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN SOME PEOPLE MAY THINK BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT
hIIw2GHVA1o_3 0 YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME FATS THAT WE NEED JUST LIKE VITAMINS EVERY DAY
hIIw2GHVA1o_4 0 THOSE ARE CALLED ESSENTIAL FATS AND ONE IS LINOLEIC ACID
hIIw2GHVA1o_5 0 THE OTHER ONE IS CALLED LINOLENIC ACID
hIIw2GHVA1o_6 0 LINOLEIC BELONGS TO A FAMILY CALLED OMEGA SIX
hIIw2GHVA1o_7 0 LINOLENIC BELONGS TO A FAMILY CALLED OMEGA-3
hIIw2GHVA1o_8 0 MOST PEOPLE GET A PRETTY FAIR AMOUNT OF THE OMEGA-6
hIIw2GHVA1o_9 0 IT'S THE OMEGA-3 THESE DAYS THAT NUTRITIONISTS ARE RECOMMENDING FOR GOOD HEART HEALTH
hIIw2GHVA1o_10 0 THAT'S THE ONE THAT SEEMS TO BE LACKING IN THE DIET
hIIw2GHVA1o_11 0 SO WHAT DO WHY DO WE NEED FATS
hIIw2GHVA1o_12 0 WELL WE NEED FATS FOR HORMONE PRODUCTION IN THE BODY FATS CUSHION THE ORGANS THE BRAIN IS SIXTY PERCENT FAT IT'S PRIMARILY THE OMEGA-3 FATS SO WE NEED IT FOR GOOD HEART HEALTH
hIIw2GHVA1o_13 0 SOME PEOPLE FEEL THAT THE THE PROBLEMS WE'RE HAVING THESE DAYS WITH HEART DISEASE AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING THE OMEGA-3'S THAT WE NEED SO AS A RESULT OUR BRAINS ARE LITERALLY DRYING UP FROM TOO MUCH OF THE BAD FATS NOT ENOUGH OF THE GOOD OMEGA-3 FATS
hIIw2GHVA1o_14 0 INFLAMMATION IS OUT OF CONTROL OUR BLOOD IS TOO THICK
hIIw2GHVA1o_15 0 SO THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THESE GOOD FATS AND I WANT YOU TO GET SOME HEALTHY FATS WITH EACH MEAL
hIIw2GHVA1o_16 0 FATS COME FROM SEEDS AND NUTS THOSE WOULD BE THE VEGETARIAN SOURCES GOOD OILS LIKE OLIVE OIL ALSO FATTY MEATS WHICH WE SHOULD TRY AND HOLD DOWN THE DIET
hIIw2GHVA1o_17 0 THOSE HARD FATS YOU KNOW WE MAKE CHOLESTEROL FROM THAT SO IF WE WANT TO KEEP OUR CHOLESTEROL DOWN YOU KNOW WE NEED TO GO WITH THE LOW FAT PROTEINS IN THE DIET LEAN PROTEIN AND EMPHASIZE THE LIQUID FATS THE ESSENTIAL FATS
hIIw2GHVA1o_18 0 THE ESSENTIAL FATS WE CAN GET FROM SEEDS AND NUTS AND FISH WOULD BE GOOD SOURCES AND OLIVE OIL OF COURSE
hIIw2GHVA1o_19 0 OLIVE OIL IS PAR PRIMARILY WHAT WE CALL OMEGA-9 WHICH IS NOT AN ESSENTIAL FAT BUT NEVERTHELESS IT'S A HEALTHY FAT AND THIS CAN EVEN BE USED FOR LIGHT SAUT ING
hIIw2GHVA1o_20 0 THE FLAX OIL IS NOT TO BE USED FOR COOKING
hIIw2GHVA1o_21 0 YOU ADD IT TO YOUR FOODS AT THE TABLE AND FLAX IS THE OMEGA-3 FAT
hIIw2GHVA1o_22 0 IT'S IMPORTANT FOR HEART HEALTH AND BRAIN HEALTH
hIIw2GHVA1o_23 0 YOU CAN EVEN GET EGGS THAT ARE OMEGA-3 ENRICHED AND WHAT THEY DO IS THEY FEED THE CHICKENS THE FLAX SEED MEAL SO THE EGGS ARE HIGHER IN THOSE HEART HEALTHY OMEGA-3 FATS
hIIw2GHVA1o_24 0 IT'S OKAY TO USE SOME BUTTER IN YOUR COOKING MODEST AMOUNTS OF BUTTER
hIIw2GHVA1o_25 0 IT'S ALL A QUESTION OF BALANCE
hIIw2GHVA1o_26 0 EVEN COCONUT OIL WHICH IS A SATURATED FAT BUT IT IS A HEALTHY OIL HEALTHY FAT AND THIS HELPS US TO MAKE MORE OF THE HEALTHY CHOLESTEROL THE HDL'S
hIIw2GHVA1o_27 0 REMEMBER WE WANT A HIGHER PROPORTION OF THOSE HDL THE HEALTHY CHOLESTEROL
hIIw2GHVA1o_28 0 SO THE BAD FATS THAT WE NEED TO AVOID WE CAN'T REALLY RECOMMEND FRYING FOR HEALTH ALTHOUGH AS I SAY SOME LIGHT SAUT ING ON OCCASION IS FINE
hIIw2GHVA1o_29 0 WE CERTAINLY WANT TO AVOID THE FATTY MEATS BACON SAUSAGE HAM THOSE TYPE OF THINGS CERTAINLY DEEP FRIED FOODS
hIIw2GHVA1o_30 0 AND AS I SAY GET A LITTLE HEALTHY FATS WITH EACH MEAL
hIIw2GHVA1o_31 0 COULD BE SOME OLIVES OR SOME OLIVE OIL OR A FEW NUTS A HANDFUL OF NUTS AND DO LIKE THE MEDITERRANEAN'S DO INSTEAD OF PUTTING BUTTER ON YOUR BREAD HAVE A LITTLE DISH OF OLIVE OIL WITH MAYBE SOME GARLIC AND HERBS IN THERE
hIIw2GHVA1o_32 0 DIP YOUR BREAD OR YOUR VEGETABLES IN THE OLIVE OIL
hIIw2GHVA1o_33 0 AND USE SOME SALAD HEALTHY MAKE YOUR OWN SALAD DRESSING
hIIw2GHVA1o_34 0 THAT'S ANOTHER WAY TO GET FATS WITH EACH MEAL
HH78mglJcnw_1 0 HI THIS IS PHILLIP TORIELLO AND THIS IS HOW TO SWIM BACKSTROKE
HH78mglJcnw_2 0 BACKSTROKE IS BASICALLY THE UPSIDE DOWN VERSION OF YOUR FREESTYLE STROKE
HH78mglJcnw_3 0 THE ONLY DIFFERENCE OR THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE IS THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED TO BREATH AS OFTEN AND AS REGULAR AS YOU LIKE SO IT MAKES IT ALMOST MORE COMFORTABLE FOR SWIMMERS
HH78mglJcnw_4 0 THE FIRST THING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS LEARN HOW TO FLOAT ON YOUR BACK BY SIMPLY PLACING YOUR HEAD BACK YOUR CHIN UP IN THE AIR PUTTING YOUR BELLY BUTTON UP AND JUST LETTING YOUR BODY FLOAT NATURALLY
HH78mglJcnw_5 0 TAKE BREATHS IN NICE AND EASY
HH78mglJcnw_6 0 A TENDENCY THAT PEOPLE HAVE IS THAT THEY STOP BREATHING
HH78mglJcnw_7 0 BASICALLY THEY JUST FILL THEMSELVES UP AFRAID TO ALLOW ANY WATER IN THEIR MOUTHS OR IN THEIR NOSE
HH78mglJcnw_8 0 BUT PLEASE KEEP ON BREATHING WHENEVER YOU'RE FLOATING ON YOUR BACK
HH78mglJcnw_9 0 THE NEXT PHASE IS JUST INCORPORATING YOUR STRAIGHT LEG POINTED TOE KICK
HH78mglJcnw_10 0 YOU'RE JUST GOING TO KEEP YOUR HIPS UP ON TOP OF THE WATER WITH YOUR PELVIC BONE UP AT THE TOP AND THEN YOU'RE JUST GOING TO KICK WITH THAT NICE SMALL FAST STRAIGHT LEG POINTED TOE KICK
HH78mglJcnw_11 0 ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR KICK DOWN YOU FLOAT AND YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THE WATER YOU CAN INCORPORATE THE PULL OR THE STROKE MOTION OF THE BACK STROKE WHICH IS BASICALLY GOING TO BE A THUMBS OUT TWISTING YOUR HAND PINKIE IN BENDING THAT ELBOW BY CATCHING THE WATER UNDERWATER AND PUSHING IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH
HH78mglJcnw_12 0 SO AGAIN THAT'S GOING TO BE A THUMBS OUT OF THE WATER PINKIE INTO THE WATER BEND THAT ELBOW UNDER CATCHING AND PUSHING ALL THE WAY THROUGH DOWN TO YOUR HIPS
HH78mglJcnw_13 0 AND IT'S GOING TO BE ONE HAND AT A TIME
HH78mglJcnw_14 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO MOVE BOTH HANDS AT THE SAME TIME
HH78mglJcnw_15 0 IT'S GOING TO BE ONE HAND AT A TIME
HH78mglJcnw_16 0 SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF THIS
HH78mglJcnw_17 0 ONE ARM PUSHES AS THE OTHER ONE'S COMING BACK DOWN YOUR HIPS THE OTHER ONE STARTS THE STROKE AND THEN YOU CAN PICK UP THE SPEED AS FAST OR AS SLOW AS YOU LIKE
HH78mglJcnw_18 0 WHATEVER IS MOST COMFORTABLE
HH78mglJcnw_19 0 TO LEARN MORE ABOUT BACK STROKE PLEASE CONTACT YOUR LOCAL SWIMMING EXPERT
geTjn_E00gk_1 0 WE'RE OFTEN ASKED WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER AN IV SEDATION PROCEDURE HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND IF YOU NOTICE ANY MAJOR CHANGES IN TERMS OF REDNESS OR SWELLING OR ITCHING CERTAINLY GO BACK TO YOUR DENTIST AND LET THEM REEVALUATE THE AREA
geTjn_E00gk_2 0 ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE DISCUSS IN TERMS OF AFTER IV SEDATION IS THE FACT THAT YOU RECEIVE AMNESIA
geTjn_E00gk_3 0 AMNESIA MEANING THE ABILITY TO NOT REMEMBER THINGS
geTjn_E00gk_4 0 THIS IS ACTUALLY A DESIRABLE THING AND THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE IV SEDATION IS TO BASICALLY CREATE YOU A RELAXED STATE AND THAT YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING
geTjn_E00gk_5 0 IT'S BECAUSE OF NOT REMEMBERING ANYTHING THAT WE TYPICALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO NOT OBVIOUSLY AFTER THE PROCEDURE NOT TO OPERATE ANY HEAVY MACHINERY DO NOT DRIVE AND CERTAINLY DO NOT MAKE ANY LEGAL DECISIONS WITHIN THE FIRST TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
geTjn_E00gk_6 0 WE FIND THAT WITH IV SEDATION ALTHOUGH IT PUTS YOU IN A RELAX STATE IT CAN TYPICALLY LAST ANYWHERE FROM FOUR TO EIGHT HOURS EVEN AFTER THE PROCEDURE HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED
geTjn_E00gk_7 0 THIS IS ALSO THE REASON WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT AN ESCORT NEEDS TO COME WITH YOU AND LEAVE WITH YOU AFTER THE PROCEDURE
geTjn_E00gk_8 0 AS FAR AS COMPLICATIONS WE VERY RARELY SEE ANY SORT OF COMPLICATIONS IT'S TYPICALLY A VERY RELAXED STATE THAT YOU'RE PUT IN AND WE DON'T TYPICALLY SEE AN COMPLICATIONS OTHER THAN MAYBE SOME LOCAL IRRITATION TO THE AREA WHERE WE STARTED THE IV
hFbspZHar5M_1 0 WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT HOW TO PREPARE YOUR PLATFORM STATEMENT FOR A PAGEANT
hFbspZHar5M_2 0 POINT THREE SHOULD STATE INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF AND WHY YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE QUALIFIED TO CARRY OUT THE TASKS OF DOING YOUR SPECIFIC PLATFORM
hFbspZHar5M_3 0 HOW YOU EXHIBIT LEADERSHIP SKILLS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE YOUR PLATFORM A SUCCESSFUL ONE
hFbspZHar5M_4 0 AND THE NEXT THING THAT WE'RE GOING TO COVER IS INCORPORATING YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE INTO YOUR PLATFORM
hFbspZHar5M_5 0 I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO BE ABLE TO RELATE TO YOUR PLATFORM
hFbspZHar5M_6 0 IN EVERY PARAGRAPH OF YOUR PLATFORM STATEMENT IT IS IMPORTANT TO STATE HOW YOU HAVE PERSONALLY BEEN AFFECTED BY SOMETHING RELATED TO YOUR PLATFORM
hFbspZHar5M_7 0 WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW TO PREPARE YOUR PLATFORM STATEMENT FOR A PAGEANT I HOPE THAT THIS HELPS YOU PREPARE BETTER FOR YOUR OVERALL PREPARATION
GEJatQ4-hbg_1 0 HI MY NAME IS LAUREN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GEJatQ4-hbg_2 0 I'M HERE TO DISCUSS SHORT CURLY LOCKS WITH YOU
GEJatQ4-hbg_3 0 MANY WOMEN HAVE MULTIPLE PRODUCTS IN THEIR BATHROOM AND THEY USE THEM NOT KNOWING WHAT EXACTLY WHICH PRODUCTS TO USE
GEJatQ4-hbg_4 0 FOR SOMEBODY LIKE HEATHER WITH FINE HAIR YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO USE LIGHT WHOLE PRODUCTS BEGINNING IN ORDER TO GET YOUR HAIR TO STAY AND STAY THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY
GEJatQ4-hbg_5 0 I RECOMMEND USING A MOUSSE IN ORDER TO CREATE VOLUME AS YOU BLOW YOUR HAIR OUT
GEJatQ4-hbg_6 0 MOUSSES ARE LIGHT WEIGHT
GEJatQ4-hbg_7 0 IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT IT ON A SCALE OF PRODUCTS MOUSSES WOULD BE YOUR LIGHTEST HOLD AND THEN THERE WOULD COME CREAMS AND YOUR GELS WHICH ARE YOUR HEAVIEST HOLD

hDLI9Lb6IO0_4 0 SO ONE THING THAT WE CAN DO TO GET RID OF THEM INSTEAD OF RUSHING THEM WITH A BLOCK BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MANY OF THEM WE CAN PLACE A PORTAL UNDER THE DIFFERENT TURRETS AND LET THEM FALL THROUGH OR WE CAN PLACE ONE BEHIND AND WALK UP AND GRAB IT LIKE WE'VE BEEN DOING
hDLI9Lb6IO0_5 0 AND THE TURRETS COME THROUGH THE PORTALS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER OBJECT SO YOU CAN REACH IN AND GRAB ONE AND THEN PULL IT AND TAKE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE
hDLI9Lb6IO0_6 0 WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF MORE TO DEAL WITH HERE
hDLI9Lb6IO0_7 0 SO WE CAN MAYBE PLACE A PORTAL ABOVE THAT ONE AND DROP A BLOCK ON IT IF WE CAN AIM THAT
hDLI9Lb6IO0_8 0 GO AHEAD AND KNOCK THAT ONE DOWN AND THAT CLEARS THIS ROOM FROM TURRETS
hDLI9Lb6IO0_9 0 WE CAN PICK UP THE BOX PUT IT ON THE PRESSURE PLATE AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOT QUITE THE EXIT YET
hDLI9Lb6IO0_10 0 WE'VE GOT A COUPLE MORE TURRETS TO DEAL WITH BUT THERE'S THIS WIRE MESH HERE THAT I CAN'T WALK THROUGH

Gz6C_yBND34_14 0 WE WANT TO REALLY FILL THIS IN WITH SOME DARK UP HERE
Gz6C_yBND34_15 0 GENERALLY LOWER LIDS UNLESS YOU'RE WORKING ON A WOMAN'S EYE WHOSE WEARING A LOT OF EYELINER ARE GOING TO BE A LOT LESS PROMINENT THAT THE UPPER EYELID
Gz6C_yBND34_16 0 VERY IMPORTANT FOR GETTING A REAL IMPRESSION OF REALISM IN AN EYE IS GET THAT UPPER LID
Gz6C_yBND34_17 0 YOU ALSO PROBABLY WANT A BIT OF LOWER LID
Gz6C_yBND34_18 0 SOMETHING THAT OFTEN PEOPLE ASK ME NOT TO DRAW WHEN I'M DOING CARICATURES OR PORTRAITS OH DON'T GET THE BAGS UNDER MY EYES

Gz6C_yBND34_25 0 GET SHADING FROM THE EYELID
Gz6C_yBND34_26 0 SHADING ONTO THE ACTUAL EYEBALL
Gz6C_yBND34_27 0 NOW HERE WE CAN GO IN WITH THE HARDER NOT QUITE AS DARK START GETTING THE IRIS
Gz6C_yBND34_28 0 YOU ALMOST NEVER UNLESS SOMEONE IS SHOCKED AND REALLY HAS THEIR EYES WIDE OPEN YOU ALMOST NEVER SEE THE ENTIRETY OF THE IRIS
Gz6C_yBND34_29 0 YOU USUALLY SEE UNLESS THEY'RE LOOKING TO A DRAMATIC DIRECTION YOU DO SEE THE ENTIRETY OF THE PUPIL
Gz6C_yBND34_30 0 THAT CAME OUT ACTUALLY DARKER SO
Gz6C_yBND34_31 0 GOOD WAY TO DO AN IRIS IS TO RAY WITH STROKES THAT START OUT HEAVY AND LIGHTEN WITH YOUR STROKE TOWARDS THE INSIDE
Gz6C_yBND34_32 0 THEY ARE DARKEST ON THE OUTSIDE
Gz6C_yBND34_33 0 AND YOU NOTICE I LEFT A GAP HERE
Gz6C_yBND34_34 0 WHAT THIS IS OF COURSE IS YOUR HIGHLIGHT YOUR SHINE FROM YOUR LIGHT SOURCE

gc3A2sAPZXc_2 0 FIRST WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ALL THE BASIC STITCHES THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TO MAKE ANY BASIC PATTERN AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SOME SPECIFIC THINGS AND SOME SPECIFIC PATTERNS THAT YOU MAY HAVE SEEN FROM YOUR GRANDMOTHER FROM YOUR AUNT OR JUST FROM ANY KIND OF ANTIQUE SHOP FOR DOILIES OR FOR BLANKETS OR FOR AFGHANS ANYTHING YOU MAY HAVE SEEN BEFORE
gc3A2sAPZXc_3 0 BEFORE WE GET INTO CROCHETING WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO USE
gc3A2sAPZXc_4 0 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS A PAIR OF SCISSORS
gc3A2sAPZXc_5 0 EVERY TIME YOU GET DONE WITH ANY TYPE OF KNOT OR LOOP OR STITCH OR CHAIN OR ROW YOU ARE GOING TO NEED TO GET SOME SCISSORS TO CUT TO GET TO THE NEXT LEVEL
gc3A2sAPZXc_6 0 THEN YOU HAVE YOUR NEEDLES NEEDLES COME IN DIFFERENT SIZES AND DIFFERENT COLORS OF COURSE THAT IS HOW THEY TELL YOU WHAT SIZE THEY ARE
gc3A2sAPZXc_7 0 THIS IS MY PREFERRED SIZE AND PLUS I JUST LIKE IT BECAUSE IT IS BLUE
gc3A2sAPZXc_8 0 AS YOU SEE IT HAS GOT THE LITTLE HOOK HERE AND THAT IS WHAT YOU GRAB YOUR YARN WITH
gc3A2sAPZXc_9 0 IT IS FLATTENED OUT RIGHT HERE AND THAT IS WHAT I LIKE TO USE FOR MY GRIP SO I CAN BACK UP AND REALLY TELL WHERE I AM AT WITH MY NEEDLE
gc3A2sAPZXc_10 0 THEN WE HAVE THESE DIFFERENT COLORS AND SIZES OF YARN
gc3A2sAPZXc_11 0 WHEN YOU READ A PACKAGE OF YARN THIS ONE SAYS WORSTED WEIGHT FOUR PLY
gc3A2sAPZXc_12 0 THIS ONE IS A BIT HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER ONES THAT I HAVE
gc3A2sAPZXc_13 0 THIS ONE IS WORSTED MEDIUM
gc3A2sAPZXc_14 0 WHEN WE GET TO THIS PATTERN YOU WILL SEE THAT THEY ALL NEED TO BE THE SAME WEIGHT TO KEEP A CONSISTENT PATTERN AND FLOW GOING SO THESE TWO ARE THE SAME
gc3A2sAPZXc_15 0 HERE WE HAVE A SOFT YARN THAT IS ALSO A WORSTED MEDIUM BUT BECAUSE IT IS SOFTER IT BENDS A BIT DIFFERENTLY SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHENEVER YOU START A PATTERN THAT YOU BUY ENOUGH YARN TO COMPLETE YOUR ENTIRE PROJECT BECAUSE THESE COME IN DIFFERENT WEIGHTS AND DIFFERENT SOFTNESS
GvUbZJ6ZBBA_1 0 HI THIS IS RICHARD GOMS WE'RE HERE IN SALT LAKE CITY UTAH
GvUbZJ6ZBBA_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO FIND SOMEONE'S CELL PHONE PROVIDER
GvUbZJ6ZBBA_3 0 THERE'S ONE SITE THAT YOU CAN DO THAT AT AND THAT'S CALLED FONEFINDER.NET
GvUbZJ6ZBBA_4 0 IT STARTS WITH AN F-O-N-E FINDER.NET

GvUbZJ6ZBBA_8 0 AND PRESS SEARCH
GvUbZJ6ZBBA_9 0 IT WILL THEN BRING UP THE PERSON'S INFORMATION AND THE CELL PHONE PROVIDER THAT THAT PERSON HAS
GvUbZJ6ZBBA_10 0 ANOTHER OPTION YOU MIGHT HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE'S CELL PHONE PROVIDER WOULD BE TO LOOK ON YOUR CELL PHONE BILL
GvUbZJ6ZBBA_11 0 IF IT'S SOMEONE THAT YOU TALK TO QUITE OFTEN IF IT SHOWS THAT YOU'RE BEING CHARGED FOR THAT THEN THAT PERSON IS NOT ON YOUR CELL PHONE PROVIDER
GvUbZJ6ZBBA_12 0 IF IT'S FREE THEN THAT PERSON IS ON THE SAME CELL PHONE PROVIDER THAT YOU ARE ON
gsLrfE_R_0M_1 0 I'M DJ POYE PROFESSIONAL JEWELER AND GEMOLOGIST AND I AM HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gsLrfE_R_0M_2 0 ALL RIGHT THE NEXT STAGE WILL BE PUNCHING AND ALSO DRILLING
gsLrfE_R_0M_3 0 AS WE KNOW THAT THESE SPACES IN HERE HAVE TO BE TAKEN OUT TO GIVE THE THREE DIMENSIONAL LOOK TO IT
gsLrfE_R_0M_4 0 SO WE PUNCH SO WE CAN HAVE THE DRILL START IN A PLACE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO DRILL WITH NO FOCAL POINT OR NO FIRST POINT
gsLrfE_R_0M_5 0 WHAT I TRY TO DO IS I TRY TO JUST I'LL JUST PUNCH A SMALL HOLE

gHxnI1B51rI_1 0 STEVE ANTHONY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS STEVE ANTHONY
gHxnI1B51rI_2 0 I'M HERE IN NEW YORK CITY
gHxnI1B51rI_3 0 TODAY I'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME BEGINNING GUITAR PICKING TECHNIQUES
gHxnI1B51rI_4 0 TUNING PART TWO WE TALKED ABOUT THE HARMONIC TUNING FIFTH FRET TAP SEVENTH FRET TAP ADJUST
gHxnI1B51rI_5 0 THERE'S ONE EXCEPTION TO THAT RULE ON YOUR GUITAR IS THAT YOUR SECOND HIGHEST STRING WHICH IS THE B STRING
gHxnI1B51rI_6 0 IT DOESN'T WORK IF YOU FRET THE PRIOR STRING AT THE FIFTH FRET
gHxnI1B51rI_7 0 YOU HAVE TO DROP DOWN TO THE FOURTH FRET
gHxnI1B51rI_8 0 YOU CAN'T REALLY DO THAT HARMONICALLY
gHxnI1B51rI_9 0 IF YOU DO THAT IT DOESN'T WORK
gHxnI1B51rI_10 0 SO THAT'S FOURTH FRET TO BE IN TUNE
gHxnI1B51rI_11 0 AND YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN ON THE TWO TOP STRINGS THOUGH IT'S A LITTLE TRICKIER
gHxnI1B51rI_12 0 I'M A LITTLE HIGH ON THAT ONE
gHxnI1B51rI_13 0 THEY'RE COMING TO GET ME
Gbtwax_kED8_1 0 HI MY NAME IS ASHLEY LUDMAN FROM SEASIDE YOGA HERE TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION HOW DO I REDUCE MUSCLE PAIN WHEN I'M PRACTICING PILATES
Gbtwax_kED8_2 0 WELL FIRST OF ALL MUSCLE PAIN AND CRAMPING SPECIFICALLY CAN TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE OVERWORKING A MUSCLE
Gbtwax_kED8_3 0 ONE OF THE CONCEPTS OF PILATES IS PRECISE MOVEMENT INCORPORATING SPECIFIC MUSCLE CONTROL IN SPECIFIC WAYS SO THAT THE EFFICIENCY AND THE FLUIDITY OF YOUR MOVEMENT IS PRESENT DURING THE EXERCISES
Gbtwax_kED8_4 0 SO I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE ONE EXERCISE WHICH IS DONE FACE DOWN
Gbtwax_kED8_5 0 SO AS YOU LIE FACE DOWN AND COME UP TO YOUR FOREARMS AND EXTEND YOUR LEGS AND INSTEAD OF POINTING YOUR TOES HARD AND POINTING FROM YOUR TOES WHAT YOU MAY FIND THAT THAT PROMOTES MUSCLE CRAMPING
Gbtwax_kED8_6 0 SOFTEN AND SPREAD YOUR TOES AND PRESS THE TOPS OF YOUR FEET TO THE FLOOR
Gbtwax_kED8_7 0 INSTEAD OF KICKING YOUR HIP FROM YOUR HEEL YOU'LL ACTUALLY ENGAGE YOUR GLUTE AND YOUR HAMSTRING AT THE TOP OF THE HAMSTRING
Gbtwax_kED8_8 0 KEEP THE FOOT SOFT
Gbtwax_kED8_9 0 SO NOTICE HOW I'M NOT HARD POINTING AT THE FOOT BUT THERE'S SOME SPREAD IN BETWEEN THE TOES
Gbtwax_kED8_10 0 SO I ENGAGE MY HAMSTRING AND GLUTE TO CREATE THE ACTION INSTEAD OF ENGAGING THE THE FOOT MUSCLES IN THE TOES AND THEN I'LL DO THE SAME THING ON THE OTHER SIDE SOFTEN AND SPREAD THE TOES CREATE LENGTH THROUGH THE ANKLE AND THEN ENGAGE FROM THE GLUTE AND THE HAMSTRING
Gbtwax_kED8_11 0 SO YOU'LL DO THAT A FEW TIMES
Gbtwax_kED8_12 0 THIS IS THIS IS ONE OF THE EXERCISES THAT WILL GET MOST PEOPLE IF THEY'RE OVERWORKING THEIR FEET
Gbtwax_kED8_13 0 IN PILATES YOU WANT TO WORK FROM YOUR CORE AND IF YOU'RE WORKING TOO HARD FROM THE EXTERNAL PERIPHERAL MUSCLES YOU'LL FEEL THAT
Gbtwax_kED8_14 0 YOU'LL FEEL IT THROUGH CRAMPS
Gbtwax_kED8_15 0 WHEN YOU NOTICE A CRAMP TAKE A BREAK PAUSE SOFTEN THAT MUSCLE RECONNECT WITH YOUR CORE AND THAT SHOULD TAKE CARE OF IT
Gbtwax_kED8_16 0 SO THAT IS HOW YOU ELIMINATE MUSCLE CRAMPS OR MUSCLE FATIGUE THROUGH THE PRACTICE OF PILATES
GItM5QLjQ54_1 0 WHEN YOUR CREEKING IN A HIGH CLASS CREEKS CLASS4 CLASS FIVE CREEKS THE WATER TENDS TO MOVE PRETTY QUICKLY SO IF YOU SWIM OUT OF YOUR BOAT YOU CAN HAVE THE UNFORTUNATE SITUATION OF HAVING CHASE AFTER YOUR BOAT
GItM5QLjQ54_2 0 AND GETTING OUT OF THE WATER CAN BE PROBLEMATIC IF THERE'S A LOT OF WATER IN IT SO THIS IS WHY WE USE FLOTATION BAGS
GItM5QLjQ54_3 0 FLOTATION BAGS WHEN THERE FILLED UP COMPLETELY AND THERE INSIDE THE BOAT THEY DISPLAYS THE WATER FROM THE BOAT SO THEY ALWAYS HAVE SOME SORT OF THE BOAT OR SOME PART OF THE BOAT LIFTING UP TOWARDS THE SURFACE SO YOU CAN PULL ON IT TOWARDS THE SHORE
GItM5QLjQ54_4 0 THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE FLOTATION BAGS IF YOUR ON A MULTI DAY TRIP AND IF YOUR OUT IN THE BACK COUNTRY FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND YOUR HAVE A LOT GEAR THAT YOU TAKE WITH YOU YOU CAN ALSO USE DRY BAGS FILLED WITH GEAR AS LONG AS THERE WATER PROOF SO IT DISPLAYS THAT WATER

gESIBQI5JOc_20 0 THIS IS HENG QUAN BEGINNING XING YI
g_cCqfIxhWE_1 0 ALRIGHT EVERY LACROSSE GAME STARTS WITH A DRAW
g_cCqfIxhWE_2 0 YOU ALSO DO A DRAW AFTER SOMEONE SCORED A POINT TO RESUME THE GAME AND YOU DO IT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE HALF TOO
g_cCqfIxhWE_3 0 SO BASICALLY WHAT IT IS IS IT'S TWO PLAYERS WHO TURN THEIR STICKS WITH THE BACKS TOWARDS EACH OTHER WITH THE BALL IN THE MIDDLE AND YOU HAVE BOTH HANDS ON THE STICK AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GET UP UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND FLING THE BALL ABOVE YOUR HEADS AND THEN ALL THE TEAMMATES KIND OF MOVE IN TO TRY TO GET THE BALL AND GRAB POSSESSION
g_cCqfIxhWE_4 0 AND SO TO WIN A DRAW YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE STURDY THAT YOUR LEGS ARE PLANTED FIRMLY AND YOU WANT TO HAVE A GOOD GRIP ON YOUR STICK AND THE WAY YOU WIN IT IS GET UNDERNEATH THE BALL REALLY QUICK AND HIT UP
g_cCqfIxhWE_5 0 SO YOU WANT TO BE THE FIRST TO GET UNDER AND HIT UP AND YOU WANT IT TO GO HOPEFULLY EITHER TOWARDS A TEAMMATE AND YOU ALSO WANT TO BE READY THAT IF YOU CAN TO SNAG IT

hFHaLD13c2Q_3 0 WE'VE GOT THE CENTIPEDE IN THERE
hFHaLD13c2Q_4 0 AS YOU CAN SEE HE'S AWFULLY TIRED AND PROBABLY MORE THAN A LITTLE BIT STRESSED OUT FROM OUR HANDLING OF HIM TODAY SO HE'S JUST KIND OF CHILLING RIGHT NOW
hFHaLD13c2Q_5 0 BEFORE WE CLOSE FOR TODAY THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT JUST VERY VERY QUICKLY
hFHaLD13c2Q_6 0 AS I MENTIONED BEFORE DEHYDRATION IS VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY A REAL RISK WITH CENTIPEDES
hFHaLD13c2Q_7 0 SO YOU DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SUBSTRATE IS STAYING NICE AND HUMID AND MOIST INSIDE THE ENCLOSURE AND A GOOD RULE FOR THAT GENERALLY WHAT I FIND IS THAT IF I CAN SEE A LITTLE BIT OF HUMIDITY OR MOISTURE GATHERING ON THE AREA OF THE ENCLOSURE THAT IS NOT SUBSTRATE I'M PROBABLY PRETTY SAFE
hFHaLD13c2Q_8 0 ALSO A GOOD COLOR INDICATION OF THE SOIL IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA TO KNOW WHAT THE COLOR OF THE SOIL IS WHEN IT'S DRIED OUT
hFHaLD13c2Q_9 0 BUT PROBABLY ON A EVERY WEEK TO WEEK AND A HALF BASIS YOU PROBABLY WANT TO GIVE IT A GOOD MISTING DOWN WITH YOUR AGED WATER
hFHaLD13c2Q_10 0 AGAIN I DO LIKE TO USE AGED WATER AS OPPOSED TO STRAIGHT TAP WATER AND I DON'T LIKE TO USE ANY KIND OF LIKE DECHLORINATING AGENT LIKE IN MY WATER FROM A FISH SUPPLY STORE OR A PET SUPPLY STORE BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE KIND OF CHEMICALS ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME SORT OF REACTION TO YOUR CENTIPEDE AND YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE THAT RISK
hFHaLD13c2Q_11 0 SO BE CAREFUL ABOUT KEEPING HIM HYDRATED KEEP HIM WARM TOO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE HIM INTO HIS ROOM HERE IN JUST A SECOND AND YOU WILL HAVE A HAPPY AND HEALTHY CENTIPEDE FOR A VERY LONG TIME
hFHaLD13c2Q_12 0 THEY'RE A PLEASURE TO WATCH AND I ENJOY THEM IMMENSELY ON DAY-TO-DAY BASIS

G_wh07AIlfU_6 0 GIVE IT A LITTLE WIGGLE MAKE SURE ITS SEATED FLUSH
G_wh07AIlfU_7 0 IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO SPIN IT JUST A LITTLE BIT TO HELP WORK THAT GREASE AROUND WHERE IT SHOULD BE
G_wh07AIlfU_8 0 ONCE YOU HAVE IT SEATED IN PLACE YOU TAKE YOUR GREASE SEAL
G_wh07AIlfU_9 0 THIS IS IT

G_wh07AIlfU_13 0 ONCE IT BOTTOMS OUT YOU'LL HEAR THE DISTINCTIVE SOUND OF SOLID MEDAL
G_wh07AIlfU_14 0 YOU CAN HEAR HOW THE SOUND CHANGED THAT MEANS THE SEAL IS PROPERLY SEATED AND READY FOR RE-INSTALLATION
H347ELByMzk_1 0 HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
H347ELByMzk_2 0 WHAT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON NOW IS WHEN RUNNING A REVERSE PLAY WHAT OUR QUARTERBACK IS GOING TO DO
H347ELByMzk_3 0 OUR QUARTERBACK RUNS JUST LIKE HE WOULD IN A NORMAL HAND OFF PLAY EXCEPT ONCE HE HANDS THE BALL OFF HE HAS TO ALSO TURN AND RUN TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FIELD SO HE CAN GO DOWN FIELD AND BECOME A BLOCKER AS WELL
H347ELByMzk_4 0 ONCE HE TAKES THE SNAP HE'LL TURN AND DO WHAT WE CALL SEEDING THE BALL
H347ELByMzk_5 0 HE'S GOING TO SEED THE BALL AND IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE A FAKE TO THE FULLBACK
H347ELByMzk_6 0 THEN HE'LL STEP THROUGH AND HAND IT OFF TO THE TAILBACK VIDEO DEMO
H347ELByMzk_7 0 SO HE FAKES TO THE FIRST GUY THROUGH HANDS IT OFF TO THE SECOND GUY THROUGH
H347ELByMzk_8 0 NOW THE QUARTERBACK WILL TURN AND RUN TO THIS SIDE OF THE FIELD AND TRY TO HELP OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLAY
H347ELByMzk_9 0 SO THE QUARTERBACK'S JOB IS JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ON THE REVERSE WHERE HE'LL FAKE THE PLAY CARRY OUT THE HAND OFF OF THE PLAY AND THEN HE'LL TRY TO GET INTO THE ACTION OF THE PLAY AND GET THE CHANCE TO THROW A BLOCK
gNwuPW0akBQ_1 0 FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS PICK THE RIGHT TYPE OF CLEANSER TO GO TO THE RIGHT TYPE OF SURROUND
gNwuPW0akBQ_2 0 YOUR SURROUND AROUND THE BATHTUB MAYBE TILE MAYBE GRANITE IT MAY BE CONCRETE OR IT COULD BE JUST NORMAL FIBERGLASS FROM THE BATHTUB
gNwuPW0akBQ_3 0 SO YOU WANT TO BE SURE WHATEVER YOU ARE WORKING WITH YOU PICK OUT THE CORRECT PRODUCT
gNwuPW0akBQ_4 0 I AM JUST I REALLY LIKE WHEN I WORK ON SURROUND I LIKE USING A LIQUID A CLEAR LIQUID INSTEAD OF PASTE BECAUSE IT'S JUST EASIER TO WASH AWAY
gNwuPW0akBQ_5 0 SO I WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS JUST TAKE A 409 OR A FANTASTIC PRODUCT AND I AM JUST GOING TO REALLY SPRAY
gNwuPW0akBQ_6 0 YOU WANT TO SPRAY IT THERE'S A LOT OF LITTLE LEDGES AND CRACKS RIGHT HERE THAT COLLECT A LOT OF DIRT SO I'M GOING TO SPRAY AND THEN I'M GOING TO TAKE MY SPONGE AND JUST GO AROUND AND GIVE IT A REALLY GOOD SOAPING
gNwuPW0akBQ_7 0 NOW YOU WHEN YOU DO THIS YOU MIGHT WANT TO WELL YOU WILL WANT TO START OFF ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF GIRLS WHO YOU HAVE YOU END UP HAVING A LOT OF HAIR IN YOUR BATHTUB
gNwuPW0akBQ_8 0 YOU'LL WANT TO TAKE ALL THE HAIR WITH A PAPER TOWEL JUST GET ALL THE HAIR AWAY FIRST BEFORE YOU START RINSING AND IT GOES INTO THE DRAIN AND CLOGS
gNwuPW0akBQ_9 0 SO FIRST CLEAN THE HAIR OFF AND THEN START SOAPING UP
gNwuPW0akBQ_10 0 AND THEN YOU WANT TO WORK WITH YOUR HANDLES AND YOUR FAUCET AND IF YOU NEED THOSE HARD TO GET AREAS YOU CAN ALSO USE JUST AN OLD TOOTHBRUSH SOFT
gNwuPW0akBQ_11 0 AND GO AROUND ALSO YOU WANT TO REMEMBER IF YOU HAVE THINGS ON YOUR BATHTUB LIKE SOAPS AND PLANTS AND THINGS
gNwuPW0akBQ_12 0 YOU WANT TO TAKE EVERYTHING OFF AND YOU PROBABLY SHOULD DO THIS BEFORE YOU BEGIN
gNwuPW0akBQ_13 0 BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES THE RESIDUE FROM THE BOTTLES WILL DRIP DOWN
gNwuPW0akBQ_14 0 SOMETIMES THEY'LL MILDEW IF THEY'VE BEEN SITTING FOR A LONG TIME
gNwuPW0akBQ_15 0 SO ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT THEN WITH A HAND SQUIRT OR WITH A BUCKET YOU ARE JUST GOING TO GO BACK AND REALLY WASH WELL
gNwuPW0akBQ_16 0 AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO RINSE SEVERAL TIMES TO BE SURE THAT YOU GET THE SOAP OFF
gNwuPW0akBQ_17 0 THIS IS ANN MYRICK AND THAT IS HOW YOU CLEAN AROUND YOUR BATHTUB THE SURROUND AND THE LEDGES
H-0T3I_6nC4_1 0 OKAY SO WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT INGREDIENT WHICH IS THE PROTEIN PART OF THE MEAL IT IS SOME FIRM TOFU WHICH I'M GOING TO OPEN UP WITH MY SCISSORS
H-0T3I_6nC4_2 0 IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO USE FIRM TOFU I THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY EXTRA FIRM WHICH IS EVEN BETTER CAUSE IF YOU USE SOMETHING THAT IS LESS FIRM IT IS JUST GOING TO BREAK UP ONCE YOUR SOUP COMES TO A BOIL
H-0T3I_6nC4_3 0 SO AND ACTUALLY THE SOON TOBU PART OF THE SOON TOBU JI GAE THIS IS THE KEY INGREDIENT THAT GIVES US IT'S NAME
H-0T3I_6nC4_4 0 SO I'M GOING TO PUT THAT BLOCK DOWN AND CHOP IT INTO SOME QUARTER INCH PIECES
H-0T3I_6nC4_5 0 NOW IT IS UP TO YOU HOW THICK YOU WANT TO DO IT BUT I WILL LIKE TO CUT THEM TO BITE SIZE PIECES
H-0T3I_6nC4_6 0 I HAVE SEEN TOFU THAT IS REALLY LARGE SLABS LIKE SAY THIS SIZE IN JI GAE BUT I THINK IT IS MORE FLAVORFUL WHEN YOU MAKE THEM SMALLER
H-0T3I_6nC4_8 0 TOFU IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF JI GAE EVEN IF THEY PUT THEY MAKE A JI GAE THAT HAS FISH IN IT BUT PUT CHUNKS OF FISH ON USUALLY KIND OF A OILY FISH LIKE MACRO THEY WOULD STILL BE TOFU IN THE STEW
H-0T3I_6nC4_9 0 SO I TAKE THE TOFU AND ADD IT TO THE POT THIS WOULD BE OUR PROTEIN
H-0T3I_6nC4_10 0 FOR YOU VEGETARIANS OUT THERE THIS IS A GREAT DISH FOR YOU
GnI9g-H3gLU_1 0 HI I'M THE STAR GODDESS AND HERE ARE SOME KEYS FOR DATING A PISCES FEMALE
GnI9g-H3gLU_2 0 THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT PISCES IS THEY ARE RULED BY THE PLANET NEPTUNE
GnI9g-H3gLU_3 0 THEIR GLYPH IS OR THEIR SYMBOL IS A FISH
GnI9g-H3gLU_4 0 TWO FISH WITH THEIR TAILS TIED TOGETHER SWIMMING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
GnI9g-H3gLU_5 0 PISCES FACE THE CONSTANT CONFLICT BETWEEN WHAT THEY THINK THEY SHOULD DO AND WHAT THEY FEEL YOU SHOULD DO
GnI9g-H3gLU_6 0 AND THOSE ARE ALWAYS AT ODDS SO THEY TRY AND GET BOTH OF THEIR NEEDS MET AND END UP DOING NOTHING
GnI9g-H3gLU_7 0 THE HARDEST THING ABOUT DATING A PISCES IS WHEN YOU SHOW UP MAKING SURE SHE'S NOT CRYING SHE'S NOT WEEPING AND SHE'S READY TO ACTUALLY GO OUT OF THE HOUSE
GnI9g-H3gLU_8 0 PISCES ARE THEY WOULD LIKE TO HELP PEOPLE OUT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITIES IF YOU WANT TO DRAG ONE OUT OF THEIR HOUSE
GnI9g-H3gLU_9 0 MAKE SURE YOU TAKE HIM TO SOMETHING LIKE A CHARITY BENEFIT OR SOMETHING FOR HELPING JERRY'S KIDS BUT THE KEY TO GETTING A PISCES TO GO OUT ON A DATE AND TO HAVE A GOOD TIME IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S SOME REDEEMING SOCIAL VALUE INSIDE OF THE DATE
GnI9g-H3gLU_10 0 IF THAT FAILS AND THE BEST THING TO DO IS GRAB A BOTTLE OF WINE A LOAF OF BREAD A HANDFUL OF DRUGS AND FIND A NICE COUCH IN A NICE QUIET ROOM TO VEG ON
GnI9g-H3gLU_11 0 SO THAT'S THE KEY TO DATING A PISCES THAT'S BETTER LIVING WITH YOUR ASTROLOGY
GnI9g-H3gLU_12 0 I'M JANET SCIALES THE STAR GODDESS
gDXMhFMxEhc_1 0 AS YOU'RE LEARNING HOW TO SPIN POI IT MIGHT NOT BE OBVIOUS AT FIRST BUT THE AWARENESS OF THE UPSWING AND THE DOWNSWING OF THE POI ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN MANIPULATING THEM TO MOVE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
gDXMhFMxEhc_2 0 IF YOU'RE HAVING A HARD TIME TURNING JUST THINK ABOUT EXAGGERATING THE DOWNSWING AND THE UPSWING UNTIL YOU GET AN INTUITIVE FEEL FOR IT
gDXMhFMxEhc_3 0 IF I'M GOING TO BE TURNING WITH MY POI SPINNING FORWARD DOWN AND THEN WITH THEM SPINNING BACKWARDS UP
gDXMhFMxEhc_4 0 IT'S ACTUALLY HELPFUL TO HAVE YOUR WHOLE BODY GET INTO THE DOWN AND THE UP TO GET THE FEELING OF WHEN THE TIMING IS FOR THE POI TO MOVE
gDXMhFMxEhc_6 0 LET YOUR BODY LEAD YOU AS YOU FEEL THE WEIGHT GOING DOWN AND UP AND EVENTUALLY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TURN IN A FULL CIRCLE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS
gDXMhFMxEhc_7 0 WHILE YOU MAY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT A LOT AT FIRST AFTER SOME PRACTICE IT WILL JUST BECOME NATURAL
gUMJ93lBku0_1 0 HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS USING YOUR PROPER DRIBBLING MECHANICS AND ALSO SOME DRIBBLE MOVES
gUMJ93lBku0_2 0 ONE DRIBBLE THAT YOU CAN USE EFFECTIVELY IS CALLED A PULL BACK DRIBBLE
gUMJ93lBku0_3 0 AND THE WAY THAT YOU USE THIS DRIBBLE IS IF YOU'RE DRIBBLING DOWN THE FLOOR AND YOUR DEFENDER IS CLOSING TIGHT ON YOU AND YOU DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE TO CONTINUE FORWARD WHAT YOU CAN DO IS YOU CAN PULL THE BALL BACK AND GET AWAY FROM YOUR DEFENDER
gUMJ93lBku0_4 0 SO AS YOU'RE GOING TO SEE FROM THESE GUYS THEY'RE GOING TO BE DRIBBLING HARD INTO THE DEFENDER AND ONCE THEY FEEL LIKE THAT THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE DRIBBLE ANYMORE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IS THEY'RE GOING TO DRIBBLE IN AND THEY'RE GOING TO PULL THE BALL BACK
gUMJ93lBku0_5 0 YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP YOUR HAND ON TOP OF IT YOU'RE GOING TO PULL THE BALL BACK
gUMJ93lBku0_6 0 WHEN YOU DO YOU DRIBBLE YOU KEEP THE BALL IN CLOSE TO YOU AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEAL YOUR DEFENDER AWAY AND KEEP YOUR SHIELD UP
gUMJ93lBku0_7 0 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP THAT SHIELD UP AS YOU'RE PULLING THE BALL BACK BECAUSE IF NOT YOU PULL THE BALL BACK AND YOU LEAVE YOURSELF OPEN AND EXPOSED THE DEFENDER ALL HE HAS TO DO IS STEP THROUGH TAKE THAT BALL AND HE'S GOING TO GO DOWN ON THE OTHER END AND SCORE IT
gUMJ93lBku0_8 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE AT FULL SPEED HERE WITH THIS GUY DRIBBLING INTO THE DEFENDER PULLING IT BACK AND THEN EXPLODING ON PAST THE DEFENDER
gUMJ93lBku0_9 0 HERE WE GO
gUMJ93lBku0_11 0 PULL IT BACK KEEP YOUR SHIELD OUT
gUMJ93lBku0_12 0 NOW HE'S GOING TO EXPLODE ON THROUGH HIM
gUMJ93lBku0_13 0 ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD
gUMJ93lBku0_14 0 SO YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT IF YOU'RE DRIBBLING INTO TRAFFIC YOU HAVE TO JUST KEEP GOING
gUMJ93lBku0_15 0 SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER TO DRIBBLE IT OUT LET THAT DEFENDER RELAX AND THEN YOU CAN GO ON THROUGH
gUMJ93lBku0_16 0 AND THAT'S CALLED USING THE PULL BACK DRIBBLE
H4Z3713bQj8_1 0 OK IT'S BEEN TWENTY FOUR HOURS SO WE'RE GOING TO SEE HOW OUR PORK BUTT DID OVERNIGHT

H4Z3713bQj8_7 0 IT SHOULD JUST BREAK APART LIKE THIS
H4Z3713bQj8_8 0 THE FIRST THING WE DID SINCE WE HAVE A BONE IN ANY KIND OF MEAT WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE THAT BONE RIGHT OUT
H4Z3713bQj8_9 0 IT SHOULD SLIDE RIGHT OUT
H4Z3713bQj8_10 0 THERE'S NO REMOVING THE FAT CAP ON THIS KIND OF MEAT IT'S JUST GOING TO FALL RIGHT A PART LIKE THAT
H4Z3713bQj8_11 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THIS CARAMEL COLOR HERE AGAIN THIS IS JUST FROM THE FAT CARAMELIZING THE IN MEAT
H4Z3713bQj8_12 0 THAT'S WHY WE WRAP IT IN THE FOIL BECAUSE WE WANT IT TO PULL APART
H4Z3713bQj8_13 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR ARM AND WE'RE GOING TO GET READY TO PULL IT
H4Z3713bQj8_14 0 WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE JUST CHUNKS OF MEAT LIKE THAT AND PULL IT
H4Z3713bQj8_15 0 IT'S REALLY HOT COMING OUT OF THE OVEN SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO DOUBLE GLOVE SO YOU DON'T BURN YOUR HANDS
g6HtDo9L5xk_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS ANGELA SPANO AND I'M GOING TO BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO MAKE NUT DOUGH TODAY FROM MY NEW BOOK NOT JUST DESSERTS
g6HtDo9L5xk_2 0 WE HAVE FINISHED SPREADING THE RASPBERRY PRESERVES EVENLY ON THE BOTTOM NOT TOO THICK JUST RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THE LITTLE MINIATURE TORTE OR THE INDIVIDUAL TORTE
g6HtDo9L5xk_3 0 I'M GOING TO PUT SOME APPLE RAISIN MIXTURE IN THERE
g6HtDo9L5xk_4 0 MAKE SURE THAT I GET A RIGHT BALANCE OF APPLES AND RAISINS NOT TOO MUCH OF ONE OR THE OTHER
g6HtDo9L5xk_5 0 I'M GOING TO PUT A LITTLE BIT MORE THIS IS SUCH AN AMAZING TORTE WHEN IT'S BAKING IN THE OVEN
g6HtDo9L5xk_6 0 THEN CINNAMON AND APPLES ARE JUST MOUTH WATERING
g6HtDo9L5xk_7 0 SEE IT'S GOOD TO MAKE THE WALL A LITTLE BIT HIGHER IN THE SMALL TORTE BECAUSE I KIND OF WANT IT TO BE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER BECAUSE OF HOW SMALL IT IS
g6HtDo9L5xk_8 0 SO I PUT THE FRUIT ALMOST TO THE TOP OF THE WALL
g6HtDo9L5xk_9 0 THERE WE GO PUT A LITTLE BIT MORE RAISINS THERE I LOVE RAISINS SO I PUT A LITTLE BIT EXTRA
gigW20f1Pec_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT A FEW MISTAKES THAT BEGINNING CONDUCTORS MIGHT MAKE
gigW20f1Pec_2 0 SO THE FIRST IS KEEPING THE ARM OUT
gigW20f1Pec_3 0 YOU'LL WANT TO KEEP BOTH ARMS OUT YOU DON'T WANT THEM BACK HERE AND YOU KNOW YOU YOU WANT THEM VISIBLE AND UP
gigW20f1Pec_4 0 AND SO YOU YOU WANT THEM OUT HERE SO THAT THE WHOLE ORCHESTRA CAN SEE THEM AND YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S NO GOING BACK HERE IT GETS REALLY CONFUSING AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO FOLLOW A CONDUCTOR THAT THAT IS CONDUCTING BACK HERE
gigW20f1Pec_5 0 AND SOME CONDUCTORS WILL DO IT BUT IT'S IT'S NOT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A GOOD PRACTICE TO GET INTO
gigW20f1Pec_6 0 SECOND THING IS A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU RE YOU'RE BEATING TIME YOU DON'T WANT YOUR ELBOW TO GET IN THE WAY
gigW20f1Pec_7 0 AND A LOT OF TIMES BEGINNING CONDUCTORS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU START GETTING KIND OF SLOPPY WITH WITH YOUR PATTERN YOUR ELBOW IF YOU NOTICE IS AND MY ELBOW IS ACTUALLY MOVING AND TELLING THE ORCHESTRA A DIFFERENT TIME THAN THE TIP OF MY BATON
gigW20f1Pec_8 0 SO IT IT'S ALMOST LIKE A WAVE EFFECT AND IT'S VERY CONFUSING BECAUSE THE CELLOS AND THE BASSES AND THIS SIDE MIGHT GET ONE YOU KNOW ONE THING AND THEY THINK MY ELBOW IS YOU KNOW THEY'RE FOLLOWING MY ELBOW ALMOST BECAUSE FROM YOU KNOW FROM THAT ANGLE IT LOOKS CONFUSING TO THE ORCHESTRA
gigW20f1Pec_9 0 AND THEN THE REST OF THE YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT CAN'T SEE MY ELBOW ARE FOLLOWING THE TIP OF THE BATON SO IT GIVES THEM ALMOST LIKE A AN ECHO EFFECT
gigW20f1Pec_10 0 THEY'RE NOT SEEING THE SAME TIME
gigW20f1Pec_11 0 THE NEXT THING IS YOU YOU ALWAYS WANT TO KEEP YOUR YOUR HANDS IN A A FORMAL GRACEFUL SORT OF POSITION
gigW20f1Pec_12 0 YOU NEVER WANT SPREAD FINGERS LIKE THAT
gigW20f1Pec_13 0 YOU ALWAYS WANT LIKE THE TWO FINGERS THE BEST IS THE YOU KNOW TWO FINGERS TOGETHER AND YOU CAN PHRASE LIKE THAT
gigW20f1Pec_14 0 YOU CAN DO CRESCENDOS WITH WITH YOUR HAND CUPPED LIKE THAT AND CUPPED DOWN FOR A DECRESCENDO
gigW20f1Pec_15 0 THE NEXT THING IS POSTURE
gigW20f1Pec_16 0 YOU ALWAYS WANT GOOD POSTURE AND YOU DON'T YOU DON'T YOU DON'T EVER WANT TO SLOUCH YOU NEVER WANT TO YOU KNOW SIT STAND LIKE THAT
gigW20f1Pec_17 0 THE ORCHESTRA IS GOING TO PLAY LIKE YOU TELL THEM TO PLAY
gigW20f1Pec_18 0 AND IT S NOT ONLY ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY AND HOW YOUR HANDS LOOK
gigW20f1Pec_19 0 IT S ABOUT IF YOUR CONFIDENT UP THERE AND ESPECIALLY YOUNGER LESS EXPERIENCED ORCHESTRAS WILL WILL SEE A CONDUCTOR THAT ISN'T AS EXPERIENCED OR CONFIDENT AND THEY WILL PICK UP ON THAT EITHER SUBCONSCIOUSLY OR CONSCIOUSLY AND THEY WILL PLAY ACCORDINGLY
gigW20f1Pec_20 0 SO YOU NEVER YOU NEVER WANT TO SLOUCH OR DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT
gigW20f1Pec_21 0 FACIAL EXPRESSION IS IMPORTANT IF YOU'RE YOU KNOW PLAYING A PIECE OR THERE'S A SECTION THAT'S YOU KNOW SOMBER MORE SAD DON'T YOU KNOW DON'T BE SMILING DON'T BE GOOFY UP ON THE PODIUM
gigW20f1Pec_22 0 YOU KNOW REFLECT THE MUSIC IN YOUR FACE AND JUST YOU KNOW DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T FIT THE MUSIC
gigW20f1Pec_23 0 BECAUSE THEY ARE WATCHING YOUR FACE AND THEY ARE LOOKING FOR WHAT YOU ARE FEELING IN THE MUSIC
HHTiIp9hYhA_2 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT INTERMEDIATE ONE-HANDED CATCHES
HHTiIp9hYhA_3 0 WHAT I LIKE TO DO TO PRACTICES CATCHES FIRST OF ALL TO CATCH WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND AND YOUR LEFT HAND IS TAKE THE FRISBEE AND CATCH IT LIKE THIS WITH YOUR LEFT HAND TOSS IT WITH YOUR LEFT HAND AND CATCH IT WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND
HHTiIp9hYhA_4 0 LEFT HAND RIGHT HAND
HHTiIp9hYhA_5 0 NOW WHEN YOU'RE FIRST STARTING TO CATCH A FRISBEE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO KIND OF PAY ATTENTION TO THE SPIN
HHTiIp9hYhA_6 0 WHEN THE FRISBEE COMES IN YOU DON'T WANT TO CLOSE YOUR HAND TOO EARLY AND YOU DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOUR HAND OPEN TOO LONG BECAUSE THE FRISBEE CAN THEN COME IN HIT YOUR HAND AND SPIN OUT
HHTiIp9hYhA_7 0 SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE TIMING AND THE HAND-EYE COORDINATION TO SQUEEZE IT AT THAT PERFECT MOMENT
HHTiIp9hYhA_8 0 NOW IF THE FRISBEE IS UP HIGH FOR THE ONE-HANDED CATCH YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR THUMB UNDERNEATH
HHTiIp9hYhA_9 0 AND THEN THE FRISBEE IS LOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR THUMB ON THE TOP LIKE THIS
HHTiIp9hYhA_10 0 NOW AGAIN YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE FIRST STARTING TO CATCH FRISBEES BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IT'S SPINNING IF IT HAS A LOT OF SPIN AND IT HITS YOUR PALM IT'S GOING TO SPIN RIGHT OUT
HHTiIp9hYhA_11 0 AND IF THE FRISBEE COMES IN AND YOU CLOSE YOUR HAND TOO EARLY IT'LL HIT YOUR HANDS AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO CATCH IT
HHTiIp9hYhA_12 0 SO PRACTICE THESE ON YOUR OWN THEY'RE REAL EASY TO DO AND YOU SHOULD HAVE A LOT OF SUCCESS

HeBgFmC7egw_9 0 YOU'RE GOING TO TOSS UP AND CLAP UP AND CLAP UP AND CLAP
HeBgFmC7egw_10 0 THE REASON YOU WANT TO CLAP IS BECAUSE YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW HIGH TO TOSS THE BALL UP TO GIVE YOU ENOUGH TIME TO CATCH IT
HeBgFmC7egw_11 0 UP AND CLAP UP AND CLAP
HeBgFmC7egw_12 0 WHEN YOU GET IT ONE HAND THEN TRY THE ONE HANDED ARK ONCE AGAIN
HeBgFmC7egw_13 0 SO INSTEAD OF UP AND CLAP YOU'RE GOING TO GO UP CLAP TOUCH IT WITH THE OTHER HAND UP CLAP TOUCH IT WITH THE OTHER HAND AND ALSO TOSS IT BACK WITH THE OTHER HAND AS WELL

GzykffdDnmE_1 0 HI MY NAME IS NATE MCCULLOUGH ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GzykffdDnmE_2 0 IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CORRECT PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZED VEHICLE
GzykffdDnmE_3 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE TOOLS REQUIRED AND THE PARTS NECESSARY TO REPLACE YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZED VEHICLE
GzykffdDnmE_4 0 WHAT I HAVE HERE IN MY LAP IS MY FOUR WAY
GzykffdDnmE_5 0 IT'S USED FOR BREAKING LOSE THE LUG NUTS ON YOUR TIRE
GzykffdDnmE_6 0 WHAT I HAVE HERE IS MY JACK STAND
GzykffdDnmE_7 0 IT'S A SAFETY DEVICE
GzykffdDnmE_8 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING A LITTLE BIT OF HORSING AROUND ON THE VEHICLE SO WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A STABLE SURFACE FOR IT TO SIT ON
GzykffdDnmE_9 0 THAT'S WHAT WE GOT THE JACK STAND FOR
GzykffdDnmE_10 0 UP IN FRONT IN THESE SMALL PACKAGES WE HAVE OUR LOWER BALL JOINTS WITH THE RETAINING NUTS AND HARDWARE INSIDE
GzykffdDnmE_11 0 WE GOT ONE MORE FOR THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE
GzykffdDnmE_12 0 WE HAVE THE UPPER CONTROL ARM BALL JOINT ASSEMBLY
GzykffdDnmE_13 0 AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S QUITE THE DEVICE
GzykffdDnmE_14 0 LIKE I SAID IT'S AN UPPER CONTROL ARM BALL JOINT ASSEMBLY
GzykffdDnmE_15 0 THIS HERE IS THE JOINT ITSELF
GzykffdDnmE_16 0 THIS IS THE CONTROL ARM AND THESE ARE THE CONTROL ARM BUSHINGS
GzykffdDnmE_17 0 THE OTHER SIDE IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL WITH A FEW MINOR DIFFERENCES
GzykffdDnmE_18 0 AS YOU CAN SEE THIS HAS AN R ON IT
GzykffdDnmE_19 0 THAT'S GOING TO INDICATE THAT IT'S THE RIGHT OR PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE
GzykffdDnmE_20 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO GET THESE MIXED UP
GzykffdDnmE_21 0 THAT WILL THROW YOUR ALIGNMENT OFF DRASTICALLY
GzykffdDnmE_22 0 IT IS POSSIBLE TO INSTALL THE WRONG ONE ON THE WRONG SIDE
GzykffdDnmE_23 0 FROM THERE I HAVE MY STANDARD AND METRIC SOCKET SET ALONG WITH A COUPLE OTHER EXTRAS I HAVE ADDED IN IN THE EMPTY SPACE
GzykffdDnmE_24 0 I HAVE MY BALL JOINT PICKLE FORK
GzykffdDnmE_25 0 IT ALSO WORKS ON TIE ROD ENDS AND MY HEAVY DUTY HYDRAULIC FLOOR JACK
GzykffdDnmE_26 0 OF COURSE A BALL JOINT PRESS WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE TO CHANGE THIS GUY
GzykffdDnmE_27 0 AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A PARTICULAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LOWER BALL JOINT AND THE UPPER BALL JOINT CONTROL ARM ASSEMBLY
GzykffdDnmE_28 0 THE CONTROL ARM ASSEMBLY HAS THE BALL JOINT ALREADY PRESSED IN IT
GzykffdDnmE_29 0 RIGHT THERE SO YOU CAN SEE THE COMPARISON
GzykffdDnmE_30 0 IT'S ALREADY PRESSED IN ASSEMBLED FROM THE FACTORY AND YOU PURCHASE IT AS ONE PIECE
GzykffdDnmE_31 0 THAT MAKES IT SO THE BALL JOINT ON THE UPPER SIDE WILL BOLT IN THROUGH YOUR CONTROL ARM BUSHING HOLES
GzykffdDnmE_32 0 THIS ONE HAS NO MOUNTING BOLTS
GzykffdDnmE_33 0 SO YOU CAN SEE ITS SPLINED HERE
GzykffdDnmE_34 0 YOU CAN SEE THE RIBS AND TEETH ON HERE
GzykffdDnmE_35 0 WHAT THAT IS GOING TO DO IS SQUEEZE INTO THE LOWER CONTROL ARM OF YOUR VEHICLE
GzykffdDnmE_36 0 IN ORDER TO DO THAT ON A FULL SIZED VEHICLE YOUR GOING TO WANT TO GET A BALL JOINT PRESS
GzykffdDnmE_37 0 IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO PURCHASE ONE
GzykffdDnmE_38 0 YOU CAN GO TO YOUR LOCAL PARTS STORE AND RENT ONE
GzykffdDnmE_39 0 THEY'LL ACTUALLY GIVE IT TO YOU FOR FREE FOR THE COST OF IT
GzykffdDnmE_40 0 WHEN YOU RETURN IT BACK IN GOOD SHAPE THEY'LL GIVE YOU YOUR MONEY BACK
GpZGJtZoO0Q_1 0 SO BEFORE YOU PERFORM IT'S GOOD TO DO SOME STRETCHING EXERCISES
GpZGJtZoO0Q_2 0 I USUALLY DO SOME ARM EXERCISES JUST LOOSENING UP YOUR ARM AND ALSO LOOSENING UP YOUR HANDS AS WELL
GpZGJtZoO0Q_3 0 DOING SOME OF THE EXERCISES I LEARNED IN THE VERY BEGINNING RELEASING YOUR FINGERS BRINGING THEM UP AGAIN
GpZGJtZoO0Q_4 0 THE OTHER THING YOU CAN DO IS GET A BALL ANY TYPE OF LITTLE LIKE RUBBER BALL AND JUST KIND OF HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND AND JUST KIND OF PRACTICE CURLING EXERCISES
GpZGJtZoO0Q_5 0 THIS LOOSENS YOUR WRIST UP AS WELL
GpZGJtZoO0Q_6 0 ANOTHER THING I DO IS ACTUALLY RUN MY HANDS UNDER WARM WATER
GpZGJtZoO0Q_7 0 IT'LL GIVE YOUR HANDS THE FEELING THAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY WARMED UP FOR ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO
GpZGJtZoO0Q_8 0 IT KIND OF LOOSENS EVERYTHING IT LOOSENS YOUR MUSCLES
GpZGJtZoO0Q_9 0 YOU CAN ALSO DO THE SAME THING WITH YOUR BOW ARM
GpZGJtZoO0Q_10 0 JUST DOING SOME STRETCHES AND ALSO LOOSENING YOUR HAND AS WELL
g7Re-BG7XnY_2 0 I'M ANNA-MARIE I'M A CANADIAN OLYMPIC ROWER
g7Re-BG7XnY_3 0 I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
g7Re-BG7XnY_4 0 WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF WARMING UP COOLING DOWN AND STRETCHING
g7Re-BG7XnY_5 0 BEFORE AND AFTER EVERY WORKOUT THAT YOU DO THERE SHOULD ALWAYS BE A SHOT WARM UP JUST ENOUGH TO GET YOU SWEATING JUST A LITTLE BIT
g7Re-BG7XnY_6 0 IF YOU'RE SWEATING IT MEANS YOUR MUSCLES ARE NICE AND LOOSE AND WARMED UP AND READY TO BEGIN THE WORKOUT
g7Re-BG7XnY_7 0 IF YOU ONLY HAVE A CHANCE TO STRETCH ONCE I WOULD RECOMMEND STRETCHING AT THE END OF THE WORKOUT BUT IF YOU HAVE THE TIME AFTER YOUR WARM-UP AND YOUR MUSCLES ARE LOOSE STRETCH BEFORE YOUR WORKOUT AS WELL
g7Re-BG7XnY_8 0 WARM-UP FOR ABOUT FIVE TEN MINUTES UNTIL YOU GET A LIGHT SWEAT GOING STRETCHING ALL THE MAJOR MUSCLE GROUPS YOU'RE GOING TO USE COMPLETE YOUR WORKOUT AND MAKE SURE YOU DO A LITTLE BIT OF A COOL-DOWN TO ALLOW THE HEART RATE TO COME BACK DOWN
g7Re-BG7XnY_9 0 SOME OF THE MAIN MUSCLES YOU'LL BE USING IN ROWING ARE YOUR QUAD MUSCLES IN THE FRONT OF YOUR LEGS YOUR HAMSTRINGS IN THE BACK OF YOUR LEGS YOU'RE GOING TO USE YOUR HIP FLEXORS THAT CROSS OVER THE HIP JOINTS YOUR GLUTE MUSCLES IN YOUR BUTTOCKS YOUR LOWER BACK YOUR LATS AND ARMS
g7Re-BG7XnY_10 0 SO REALLY IN ROWING IT'S IMPORTANT TO STRETCH EVERYTHING
g7Re-BG7XnY_11 0 YOU CAN DO A QUAD STRETCH FOR THE FRONT OF YOUR LEGS
g7Re-BG7XnY_12 0 YOU CAN DO A HAMSTRING STRETCH FOR THE BACK OF YOUR LEGS LYING ON YOUR BACK AND BRINGING YOUR LEG OVER YOU HEAD
g7Re-BG7XnY_13 0 YOU CAN STRETCH OUT YOUR LOWER BACK BY TWISTING TO THE SIDE OR TUCKING YOUR KNEES UP TO YOUR CHEST
g7Re-BG7XnY_14 0 YOU CAN STRETCH OUT YOUR HIP FLEXORS IN THE FRONT OF YOUR HIPS BY KNEELING ON ONE KNEE AND PUSHING YOUR HIPS FORWARD STRETCHING OUT YOUR BACK MUSCLES BY SITTING RIGHT BACK ON YOUR HEELS AND REACHING ACROSS YOUR BODY
g7Re-BG7XnY_15 0 OTHER MUSCLES THAT MAY GET TIGHT ARE YOUR FOREARMS IF YOU'RE GRIPPING TOO MUCH
g7Re-BG7XnY_16 0 YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE ROWING NICE AND RELAXED BUT IF YOUR FOREARMS DO GET TIGHT JUST FLIP YOUR HANDS OVER AND PRESS YOUR PALMS OVER
g7Re-BG7XnY_17 0 REMEMBER TO STAY NICE AND LOOSE BY STRETCHING AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE FULLY WARMED UP AND FULLY COOLED DOWN AT THE END OF YOUR WORKOUT
_HcmOGUXmKk_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS LIZABETH MULLER AND TODAY WE ARE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE SPANISH OMELET
_HcmOGUXmKk_2 0 THE FIRST THING I M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO CUT MY POTATO
_HcmOGUXmKk_3 0 I ONLY NEED 1/2 OF ONE
_HcmOGUXmKk_4 0 PEEL MY POTATO AND I'M GOING TO DICE IT IN PIECES
_HcmOGUXmKk_5 0 NOW LIKE I SAID IN SPAIN THEY ACTUALLY FRY THE POTATO
_HcmOGUXmKk_6 0 I'M GOING TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF A HEALTHIER VERSION OF THIS
_HcmOGUXmKk_7 0 I'M GOING TO BOIL MY POTATO FIRST NOT COMPLETELY COOKED
_HcmOGUXmKk_8 0 I'M GOING TO JUST BOIL IT A LITTLE BIT OKAY AND THEN I'M GOING TO FRY IT IN LATER WITH MY STUFF LIKE A SOFRITO
_HcmOGUXmKk_9 0 SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE THIS HERE AND SHOW YOU HOW I DICE IT UP
_HcmOGUXmKk_10 0 I WANT IT DICED LIKE IN SQUARE PIECES OKAY AND PIECES ABOUT LIKE THIS SIZE
_HcmOGUXmKk_11 0 IF YOU WANT THEM A LITTLE BIT SMALLER YOU CAN DO THEM SMALLER THEY WOULD COOK FASTER
_HcmOGUXmKk_12 0 BUT ABOUT A 1/2 OF A POTATO WOULD DO FOR FOUR EGGS OKAY
_HcmOGUXmKk_13 0 THE MAIN THING IS TO HAVE A POTATOES LOTS OF POTATOES BECAUSE THAT IS THE BASIC THING THAT THEY USE POTATOES
G86v1M4mmXc_1 0 SINGLE LEG CIRCLES WITH THE LEFT LEG
G86v1M4mmXc_2 0 TAKE THE STRAP AROUND THE BALL OF THE FOOT AND LAY RIGHT DOWN
G86v1M4mmXc_3 0 PLACE BOTH HANDS ON THE STRAP INITIALLY AND TAKE THE RIGHT FOOT FIRMLY ON THE FLOOR
G86v1M4mmXc_4 0 YOU TAKE THE HANDS UP THE STRAP AND THEN MAKE A CIRCLE
G86v1M4mmXc_5 0 AS THE FOOT MAKES THAT CIRCLE YOU WANT TO ISOLATE THE MOVEMENT AND YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR BACK ON THE FLOOR BY THE RIGHT FOOT STAYING FLAT ON THE FLOOR
G86v1M4mmXc_6 0 YOU CAN MOVE THE HAND DOWN YOU CAN TAKE YOUR RIGHT ARM OUT ON THE FLOOR
G86v1M4mmXc_7 0 YOU CAN MAKE A WIDER CIRCLE WHERE WE'RE USING THE STRAP AND CONTROLLING THE MOVEMENT JUST TO HIP TO THE FOOT
G86v1M4mmXc_8 0 THE SINGLE LEG CIRCLES WORK WITH THE LEFT HIP BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO WORK CONNECTING WITH THE LOW BACK AND YOUR ABDOMINAL MUSCLE
G86v1M4mmXc_9 0 BREATHING DEEP THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND EXHALE
G86v1M4mmXc_10 0 AND YOU ALWAYS COMPENSATE BY REVERSING THE DIRECTION OF THAT CIRCLE
G86v1M4mmXc_11 0 INHALING AND EXHALING
G86v1M4mmXc_12 0 KEEPING THE SHOULDER RELAXED YOUR HAND'S JUST HOLDING ONTO THAT STRAP
G86v1M4mmXc_13 0 JUST INHALING AND EXHALING AND THEN RELEASE
G86v1M4mmXc_14 0 BRING THAT IN
GpFelEBDJ_g_1 0 HI I'M TIM GIPSON AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO SELECT CARPET FOR YOUR ROOM
GpFelEBDJ_g_2 0 NOW WHEN YOU'RE SELECTING CARPET IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT TYPE OF ROOM
GpFelEBDJ_g_3 0 NOW IN THIS PARTICULAR ROOM WE'VE GOT WALL-TO-WALL CARPET AND THEN WE'VE ALSO GOT AN ACCENT RUG THAT'S BEEN PUT IN HERE
GpFelEBDJ_g_4 0 EVEN IN AREAS THAT YOU HAVE HARDWOOD FLOORS OR EVEN TILE YOU MAY SELECT SOME AREA RUGS THAT BRING SOME ELEMENTS OF WARMTH AND DESIGN INTO THE ROOM BUT ALSO PRODECK PROTECT YOUR MAIN CARPET IN HIGH TRAFFIC OR HIGH WEAR AREAS
GpFelEBDJ_g_5 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT SELECTING YOUR CARPET FOR YOUR ROOM A BASIC CONSIDERATION IS HOW MUCH TRAFFIC ARE YOU GOING TO GET IN AND THAT MAY DEPEND ON THE TYPE OF CARPET THAT YOU GO WITH
GpFelEBDJ_g_6 0 AND ALSO IF YOU'RE RECARPETING A ROOM YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP IN MIND AS FAR AS THE STYLE AND THE TYPE OF CARPET THAT YOU USE IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO ADD A RESALE VALUE TO YOUR HOME
GpFelEBDJ_g_7 0 THERE ARE VERY TEMPORARY CONTEMPORARY CARPETS AND THERE ARE VERY TRADITIONAL CARPETS AND SO IF YOU GO TO EXTREMES OF DESIGN OR STYLE THEN YOU MAY LIMIT YOUR PROSPECTS AS FAR AS WHEN YOU GET INTO THE RESALE VALUE
GpFelEBDJ_g_8 0 SO TYPICALLY ON YOUR WALL-TO-WALL YOU MAY WANT TO PICK CARPETS THAT ARE MORE NEUTRAL AND SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN ADD AREA CARPETS THAT CAN BE ACCENTED SO THAT THEY WILL MAINTAIN THE VALUABLE AND THE RESELL ABILITY OF YOUR OF YOUR HOME
GpFelEBDJ_g_9 0 NOW IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE PARTICULARLY HIGH TRAFFIC AREAS THEN YOU MAY WANT TO CON CONSIDER CARPETS SUCH AS A BERBER THAT TEND TO BE MORE WEAR RESISTANT OR IF YOU GO WITH SOME KIND OF A WALL-TO-WALL CARPET THAT HAS A SHAG YOU MAY WANT TO GO WITH A REALLY LOW PILE
GpFelEBDJ_g_10 0 THE LOWER THE PILE THEN TYPICALLY THE MORE WEAR RESISTANT THOSE CARPETS WILL BE
GpFelEBDJ_g_11 0 SO I'M TIM GIPSON AND THAT'S SOME TIPS ON HOW TO CHOOSE CARPET FOR YOUR ROOM

GS5bzvBC8z4_1 0 HEY EVERYBODY DON GOLDEN BACK WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE ARE GOING TO EMBARK ON THE TABLE LEG REPAIR HERE FOR THAT BEAUTIFUL DESK THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
GS5bzvBC8z4_2 0 BEFORE WE CAN PUT THIS BACK ON WE HAVE GOT SOME WORK TO DO
GS5bzvBC8z4_3 0 NOW WE ARE GOING TO DRILL OUT THE HOLE WHICH HOLDS THE SCREW
GS5bzvBC8z4_4 0 NOW THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROJECT
GS5bzvBC8z4_5 0 IF YOU DON'T GET THIS HOLE PERFECTLY STRAIGHT OR AS STRAIGHT AS YOU CAN YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A LEG THAT IS A LITTLE COCK EYED AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT SO THERE IS A COUPLE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO INSURE THAT
GS5bzvBC8z4_6 0 NUMBER ONE HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE GOT A NICE DRILL THAT HAS A LEVEL ON IT
GS5bzvBC8z4_7 0 THIS IS GOING TO HELP THIS HAS A SIDE LEVEL AS WELL AS A TOP LEVEL A CIRCULAR LEVEL THAT SHOWS YOU DEAD ON CENTER AS FAR AS WHEN YOU ARE DRILLING DOWN INTO SOMETHING
GS5bzvBC8z4_8 0 SO WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS I AM GOING TO TAKE OUR LEG AND MY TRUSTY LITTLE WORK BENCH HERE AND WE CAN MOUNT THIS RIGHT DOWN INSIDE AND TIGHTEN UP THE SUPPORTS TO HOLD THIS IN PLACE AND WHAT I WILL DO ONCE I HAVE GOT THAT DONE IS CHECK IT FOR LEVEL
GS5bzvBC8z4_9 0 I HAVE GOT A LITTLE HAND HELD LEVEL HERE AND LET'S JUST GO DOWN UNDERNEATH AND HOLD IT UP AGAINST HERE AND SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT
GS5bzvBC8z4_10 0 YOU CAN SEE OUR LITTLE BUBBLE HERE AND I'M GOING TO PULL IT A LITTLE THAT WAY
GS5bzvBC8z4_11 0 O'KAY THAT IS PRETTY LEVEL
GS5bzvBC8z4_12 0 I THINK WE ARE GOOD TO GO TIGHTEN IT UP AND WHEN I COME BACK I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT BITS YOU ARE GOING TO USE AND HOW TO DRILL THIS THING JUST RIGHT
GP7mCgkwC-4_2 0 I'M GARY FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
GP7mCgkwC-4_3 0 NOW ONCE WE HAVE OUR DATA LET'S SEE HOW TO WORK WITH IT
GP7mCgkwC-4_4 0 THERE IS A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT WE NEED TO BE SURE OF BEFORE WE PUT OUR DATA INTO THE LETTER
GP7mCgkwC-4_5 0 FIRST WE SEE THAT WE HAVE ALL OF OUR FIELDS HERE
GP7mCgkwC-4_6 0 THOSE FIELDS HAVE TO BE MATCHED UP WITH THE FIELDS INSIDE THE MICROSOFT WORD PROGRAM
GP7mCgkwC-4_7 0 IN OTHER WORDS WHEN I CREATED MY DATABASE I CREATED CONTACT LAST NAME BUT THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY WHAT THE MICROSOFT WORD WILL RECOGNIZE IT AS
GP7mCgkwC-4_8 0 SO ONE THING WE HAVE TO DO WHEN WE WORK WITH OUR DATABASE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE OUR FIELDS ARE MATCHED UP AND ALL OF OUR FIELDS THAT HAVE CHECK MARKS ARE THOSE ARE THE ONES FROM OUR DATABASE THAT ARE GOING TO BE PUT INTO OUR LETTER
GP7mCgkwC-4_9 0 NOW WE MIGHT HAVE A DATABASE AND WE MIGHT SAY WELL THIS GUY DOESN'T NEED A LETTER OR HE GOT A LETTER LAST WEEK SO HERE YOU CAN PICK AND CHOOSE PEOPLE FROM YOUR DATABASE ARE GOING TO RECEIVE THE DOCUMENT THE MAIL MERGE THAT YOU ARE CREATING
GP7mCgkwC-4_10 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO PICK EVERYTHING
GP7mCgkwC-4_11 0 YOU CAN PICK AND CHOOSE AND THESE ARE THE FIELDS THAT ARE GOING TO TO INTO LETTER NOTE
GP7mCgkwC-4_12 0 SEE HERE THE CHECK NOTES NEXT TO BLANK FIELDS
GP7mCgkwC-4_13 0 WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS WHEN THE INFORMATION WHEN WE CLICK ON THE END WHEN WE PUT THE INFORMATION INTO OUR LETTER THESE FIELDS ARE GOING TO BE BLANK BECAUSE THERE IS NO INFORMATION THERE AND SO ALL OF THESE FIELDS THAT WE SEE HERE ARE GOING TO CREATE BLANK PAGES FROM OUR DOCUMENT
GP7mCgkwC-4_14 0 THE DOCUMENT WILL BE THERE BUT THE FIELDS WILL BE EMPTY
GP7mCgkwC-4_15 0 SO INSTEAD OF TAKING THOSE BLANK CHECK MARKS OUT OF THOSE FIELDS THE EASIEST THING TO DO BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE A FEW NAMES THAT WE WANT TO USE IS TO CLEAR ALL AND EVERYTHING WILL BE EMPTY AND IT WILL BE MUCH EASIER TO CHECK THE ONES THAT WE WANT INSTEAD OF GOING ALL THE WAY DOWN THE LIST AND UNCHECKING EVERYTHING
GP7mCgkwC-4_16 0 SO THIS IS THE FIRST THING WE ARE GOING TO DO WITH OUR DATABASE IS SELECT OUR RECIPIENTS AND THAT WILL HELP US SAVE SOME TIME LATER ON WHEN WE GO AHEAD AND PRINT OUR LETTERS
GP7mCgkwC-4_17 0 SO YOU SEE HERE THAT OUR DATABASE IS SELECTED THAT'S THE NAME OF OUR FILE AND WE ARE READY FOR OUR NEXT STEP
h9mVtl8sRBc_1 0 HI I'M JASON WITH RED RUM STUDIOS
h9mVtl8sRBc_2 0 WE'RE TO THE POINT WHERE WE WANT TO CUT FOR THE PATCH
h9mVtl8sRBc_3 0 NOW WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT THE SEAMS IN THE PATCH
h9mVtl8sRBc_4 0 IT'S HARD TO PAINT ON IT'S NOT GOING TO BE COMFORTABLE TO SIT ON
h9mVtl8sRBc_5 0 BUT THIS THIS RIGHT HERE AND THIS ALONG HERE THESE HEMS ARE EXTREMELY VALUABLE
h9mVtl8sRBc_6 0 THEY COME IN REALLY HANDY SO YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST SIT AND CHOP THEM UP AND RIP THEM APART
h9mVtl8sRBc_7 0 I LIKE TO CUT WHEN I CUT MY STUFF I LIKE TO CUT AND LEAVE THE HEMS IN PLACE
h9mVtl8sRBc_8 0 SO JUST CUT UP THE SIDE AND THEN CUT TOOK MY RAZOR BLADE CAUSE IT WON'T FIT ALL THE WAY ACROSS
h9mVtl8sRBc_9 0 CUT YOUR PATCH OUT
h9mVtl8sRBc_10 0 AND TRY NOT TO UNDO ANY OF THE THREADS ON THESE
h9mVtl8sRBc_11 0 I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE THAT FOR WHEN WE'RE MAKING THE PANTS LATER ON
h9mVtl8sRBc_12 0 SO STARTED TO GET OUR MATERIAL OUT
h9mVtl8sRBc_13 0 JUST CUT ALONG ABOUT THE SIZE YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO WANT
h9mVtl8sRBc_14 0 OKAY I GOT MATERIAL FOR MY PATCH
h9mVtl8sRBc_15 0 WE'LL GO FROM THERE
HbPQ89ZcC68_1 0 SO IN THIS SECTION WE'RE JUST GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TAIL WHEELIE AND A NOSE WHEELIE
HbPQ89ZcC68_2 0 BASICALLY A NOSE WHEELIE IS THE SAME CONCEPT AS A TAIL WHEELIE YOU'RE JUST SWITCH
HbPQ89ZcC68_3 0 YOU JUST HAVE ALL YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR NOSE INSTEAD OF YOUR TAIL AND YOU'RE GOING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SWITCHED
HbPQ89ZcC68_4 0 I'M A GOOFY-FOOTER SO IF I DID A TAIL WHEELIE MY WEIGHT WOULD CENTER OVER MY BACK FOOT BEING MY LEFT FOOT LIKE SO
HbPQ89ZcC68_5 0 AND IF I WANTED TO CHANGE UP AND DO A NOSE WHEELIE I'D SIMPLY RIDE DOWN SWITCHED
HbPQ89ZcC68_6 0 DO THE SAME STEPS AND PUT ALL MY WEIGHT ON MY NOSE LIKE SO
HbPQ89ZcC68_7 0 AND THAT'S BASICALLY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NOSE WHEELIE AND A TAIL WHEELIE
HbPQ89ZcC68_8 0 IF YOU LEARN HOW TO DO THEM BOTH WAYS THAT'S BETTER THAN IF YOU CAN ONLY DO THE ONE WAY
HbPQ89ZcC68_9 0 IT'S BETTER TO BE A STRONG RIDER BOTH DIRECTIONS THAN AN AVERAGE RIDER ONE DIRECTION
HbPQ89ZcC68_10 0 SO IF YOU I'M GOOFY FOOTED BUT IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE A REGULAR FOOTED IT'S THE SAME CONCEPT
HbPQ89ZcC68_11 0 A TAIL WHEELIE ALL OF YOUR WEIGHT WOULD BE FOCUSED ON YOUR RIGHT LEG LIKE SO
HbPQ89ZcC68_12 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOUR LEFT FOOT IS FORWARD
HbPQ89ZcC68_13 0 THAT IS A REGULAR TAIL BLOCK I MEAN TAIL WHEELIE
HbPQ89ZcC68_14 0 IF YOU WANTED TO DO A NOSE WHEELIE JUST SWITCH IT UP AND PUT ALL OF YOUR WEIGHT OVER YOUR LEFT FOOT AND RAISE YOUR RIGHT FOOT
HbPQ89ZcC68_15 0 AND THAT WOULD BE A TAIL WHEELIE
HbPQ89ZcC68_16 0 THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE ON YOUR NOSE OR YOUR TAIL
HbPQ89ZcC68_17 0 WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOOFY OR REGULAR
HbPQ89ZcC68_18 0 GET OUT THERE AND HAVE FUN WITH IT
guciDu9QD2M_1 0 BIRDS IN THE WILD PICK OUT FRUITS AND BERRIES AND NUTS AND SO FORTH
guciDu9QD2M_2 0 THEY ALSO EAT THESE THINGS IN THE CAGED PET LIFE
guciDu9QD2M_3 0 BUT YOU NEED TO REMEMBER THAT IN THE WILD THEY KNOW WHAT ONES TO EAT AND WHAT ONES NOT TO EAT
guciDu9QD2M_4 0 IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY GET FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
guciDu9QD2M_5 0 IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY GET THE PROPER PROTEIN DIET AND THE PROPER VITAMINS AND MINERALS THAT THEY NEED
guciDu9QD2M_6 0 THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT BIRDS CANNOT HAVE
guciDu9QD2M_7 0 AND THESE ARE CHOCOLATE AND CHOCOLATE IS VERY TOXIC TO BIRDS
guciDu9QD2M_8 0 AVOCADOS EVEN THOUGH IT'S IN THE FRUIT VEGETABLE LINE BIRDS CAN NOT TOLERATE AVOCADOS
guciDu9QD2M_9 0 THEY CANNOT HAVE ALCOHOL
guciDu9QD2M_10 0 YOU WILL FIND THAT SOME PEOPLE WILL PUT A DROP OF ALCOHOL IN A BIRDS BEAK IF THEY WANT TO SELL IT
guciDu9QD2M_11 0 THEY DO THAT TO GET THE BIRD TO CALM DOWN AND BE NICE
guciDu9QD2M_12 0 AND THEN YOU GET THE BIRD HOME THE ALCOHOL WEARS OFF AND THEY HAVE A VIOLENT HANGOVER AND YOU WILL BE BITTEN
guciDu9QD2M_13 0 THEY DO NEED RHUBARB PLUMS AND ANYTHING THAT HAS A LOT OF SALT IN IT
guciDu9QD2M_14 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE FEEDING YOUR BIRD MAKE SURE THAT THE NUTRITION THAT YOU'RE GIVING YOUR BIRD IS WHAT THE BIRD NEEDS
guciDu9QD2M_15 0 AND EVEN THOUGH YOU WILL HEAR PEOPLE SAY OH I GAVE MY BIRD SOME CHOCOLATE OR I GAVE MY BIRD SOME OF THIS OR THATIT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY HAVE NOT HARMED THAT BIRD
guciDu9QD2M_16 0 THEY DO NOT NEED CHOCOLATE THEY DO NOT NEED CAFFEINE
guciDu9QD2M_17 0 THEY DO NOT NEED AVOCADOS ESPECIALLY
guciDu9QD2M_18 0 SO BE PARTICULARLY CAUTIONS OF YOUR BIRDS DIET
gZXj3t75ZGQ_1 0 HI THIS IS JON ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE IN THIS VIDEO CLIP WE WILL MAKING CLEATS
gZXj3t75ZGQ_2 0 CLEATS ARE SMALL PIECES OF WOOD THAT WE NAIL ON TO OUR CABINETRY THAT WILL BE ON THE INSIDE WHERE NO ONE CAN SEE IT
gZXj3t75ZGQ_3 0 THIS WILL AIDE WHEN WE PUT OUR TOP ON WILL BE ABLE TO NAIL OUR TOP DOWN
gZXj3t75ZGQ_4 0 THE CLEATS THAT I WILL MAKING OUR 3/4 X 3/4 NOW IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT OUR PLYWOOD SHEETS THAT WE CUT OUT PIECES OUT WE HAVE SOME SCRAP LEFT THAT WE WILL BE USING THESE CLEATS OUT OF
gZXj3t75ZGQ_5 0 SINCE MY PLYWOOD IS ALREADY 3/4 THICK ALL I NEED TO DO IS SET MY TABLE SAW TO 3/4 AND I WILL HAVE A PIECE THAT IS 3/4 X 3/4
gZXj3t75ZGQ_6 0 I DIDN'T MAKE AN EXACT NUMBER OF CLEATS I JUST USED UP MY BOARD AND MADE A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM
hgxmXEs2EfM_1 0 SO NOW WE'RE DRAWING IN THE GAME OF JOHNSON AND FOR THIS SEGMENT AND THE REST OF THE HOW TO DEAL SEGMENTS WE'RE GOING TO PLAY THE HAND LOW SO IT'S THE DRAW PHASE
hgxmXEs2EfM_2 0 THE FIRST PLAYER TO THE LEFT OF THE DEALER SAYS I WANT THIS MANY CARDS AND THE DEALER GIVES THAT PLAYER THAT NUMBER OF CARDS SO HE SAYS THREE CARDS
hgxmXEs2EfM_3 0 ONE TWO THREE
hgxmXEs2EfM_4 0 NOW LET'S LOOK AT YOUR HAND
hgxmXEs2EfM_5 0 YOUR HAND IS ACTUALLY A PAT SEVEN-LOW SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DRAW
hgxmXEs2EfM_6 0 YOU'RE GOING TO PUT OUT ZERO CARDS AND YOU'RE GOING TO SAY STAND PAT
hgxmXEs2EfM_7 0 TO YOUR LEFT AND DON'T BE SURPRISED WHEN YOU DO THAT IF EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE GOES OOOH
hgxmXEs2EfM_8 0 TO YOUR LEFT THE PLAYER WANTS TWO CARDS AND I AM TAKING TWO CARDS
hgxmXEs2EfM_9 0 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
hgxmXEs2EfM_10 0 THAT IS FOR THE NEXT SEGMENT
G_q2GdcAglE_1 0 IN THIS VIDEO I AM GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT A CLUB BALANCE
G_q2GdcAglE_2 0 NOW THIS IS A MEDIUM TO HARD CLUB TRICK
G_q2GdcAglE_3 0 REALLY YOU CAN INCORPORATE IT INTO A BALL PATTERN BUT YOU CAN BALANCE ANYTHING YOU WANT
G_q2GdcAglE_4 0 JUGGLERS DO IT AS LIKE TRADITIONALLY JUGGLERS WILL DO IT IN A PATTERN
G_q2GdcAglE_5 0 THEY'LL BALANCE A JUGGLING CLUB ON THEIR CHIN
G_q2GdcAglE_6 0 A LOT OF JUGGLERS DO SKITS WHERE THEY'LL BALANCE LIKE A TABLE A CHAIR LIKE A LADDER ON THEIR CHIN
G_q2GdcAglE_7 0 ALL THIS CRAZY STUFF
G_q2GdcAglE_8 0 REALLY BALANCING SOMETHING ON YOUR CHIN DOES NOT TAKE AS LONG AS YOU MIGHT THINK
G_q2GdcAglE_9 0 TO LEARN HOW TO DO IT WELL FIRST OFF I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
G_q2GdcAglE_10 0 THIS IS A CHIN BALANCE
G_q2GdcAglE_11 0 YOU CAN SEE I'M CONSTANTLY ADJUSTING MYSELF SO THAT I KEEP THE CLUB BALANCED STRAIGHT ON MY FACE
G_q2GdcAglE_12 0 IT'S ALSO PRETTY COMMON TO DO ONE ON THE NOSE LIKE THAT OR THE FOREHEAD LIKE THAT
G_q2GdcAglE_13 0 NOW TO LEARN HOW TO DO THIS WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO IS FIND SOMETHING LONGER THAN THE STANDARD JUGGLING CLUB
G_q2GdcAglE_14 0 THE LONGER IT IS THE SLOWER IT FALLS DOWN AND THE MORE TIME YOU HAVE TO RESPOND
G_q2GdcAglE_15 0 ANOTHER HELPFUL THING IS IF THERE'S MORE WEIGHT CONCENTRATED ON THE FAR END
G_q2GdcAglE_16 0 A LOT OF PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO BALANCE WITH A BROOM
G_q2GdcAglE_17 0 LIKE A BROOM HEAD ON THE FAR END IT'S TALL IT'S HEAVY ON THE FAR END
G_q2GdcAglE_18 0 IT'LL FALL DOWN REALLY SLOW
G_q2GdcAglE_19 0 SO YOU CAN JUST LIKE RUN OVER UNDERNEATH IT AND PICK IT BACK UP
G_q2GdcAglE_20 0 A GOOD WAY TO LEARN HOW TO DO IT WITH JUGGLING CLUBS SPECIFICALLY IS PUT A BEAN BAG ON THE TOP OF THE CLUB
G_q2GdcAglE_21 0 WHAT THIS WILL DO THIS WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO FOCUS ON WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE TIP OF THE CLUB AND IT WILL SLOW THE FALL DOWN A LITTLE BIT
G_q2GdcAglE_22 0 SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS PUT A BALL ON THE TOP OF THE CLUB LOOK AT THAT BALL
G_q2GdcAglE_23 0 LOOK AT THE FURTHEST POINT YOU CAN POSSIBLY SEE AND TRY AND GET THAT BALANCE AS CLEAN AS YOU CAN
G_q2GdcAglE_24 0 THEN WE CAN WORK THIS INTO THE PATTERN AND DO SOME PRETTY AWESOME THINGS WITH IT
gBxfuKjRCc8_1 0 PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT AFFINITIES OR DIFFERENT GIFTS AND I JUST REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS MY GIFT AND IT'S WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE DOING
gBxfuKjRCc8_2 0 I HAD THE JOB OPPORTUNITY CAME ABOUT NINE YEARS AGO A LITTLE OVER NINE YEARS AGO
gBxfuKjRCc8_3 0 JUST BEING RAISED IN THE MIDDLE OF IT I DID THAT BUT AGAIN IT WASN'T EVER AN OPTION THAT IT WAS A JOB
gBxfuKjRCc8_4 0 IT WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU DID SO THEN WHENEVER I WENT TO SCHOOL AND I GOT MY DEGREE IN PHYSICAL THERAPY AND WAS DOING THAT WITH HUMANS BUT YET STILL WORKING IN THE ANIMAL WORLD ANIMAL CARE WORLD VOLUNTEERING IN THAT AND THAT'S HOW THIS EVOLVED
gBxfuKjRCc8_5 0 IT JUST LED TO IT
gBxfuKjRCc8_6 0 I DON'T REALLY RECALL EVER REALLY WANTING TO BE ANYTHING
gBxfuKjRCc8_7 0 INITIALLY WHEN I WENT TO COLLEGE I STUDIED ACTING
gBxfuKjRCc8_8 0 I DID A LOT OF ACTING IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE AND EVEN AFTER COLLEGE SO I GUESS AT SOME POINT I WANTED TO BE AN ACTRESS
gBxfuKjRCc8_9 0 I WANTED TO BE A BALLERINA BUT I NEVER REALLY HAD A BURNING PASSION OR KNEW THAT THIS WAS IT AND I NEVER WAS REALLY PRESSED BY MY FAMILY TO SAY YOU HAVE TO BE THIS
gBxfuKjRCc8_10 0 I JUST KIND OF ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WHATEVER I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WOULD HAPPEN
GW_3gR4MCZg_1 0 ALRIGHT THE DRINK WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE IS CALLED AJS BUBBLING BREW
GW_3gR4MCZg_2 0 FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS ADD SOME ICE TO A GLASS
GW_3gR4MCZg_3 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO DO A HALF A SHOT OF ONE FIFTY ONE
GW_3gR4MCZg_4 0 NOW THIS DRINK YOU WOULD USUALLY LIGHT ON FIRE
GW_3gR4MCZg_5 0 AND THE ONE FIFTY ONE CAN'T HELP THAT
GW_3gR4MCZg_6 0 UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO FIRE CODES IN THIS PARTICULAR BAR WE CANNOT DO THAT
GW_3gR4MCZg_7 0 SO THE NEXT THING WE'RE GOING TO ADD IS A HALF A SHOT OF TEQUILA I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET BUT KEEP WATCHING
GW_3gR4MCZg_8 0 IT'S STILL GOING TO TASTE THE SAME
GW_3gR4MCZg_9 0 HALF A SHOT OF SOUTHERN COMFORT AND A HALF A SHOT OF PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS
GW_3gR4MCZg_10 0 O.K NOW WE'RE GOING TO MIX THESE INGREDIENTS TOGETHER AND LET'S GRAB A GLASS AND POUR THESE IN
GW_3gR4MCZg_11 0 AND THE LAST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS GRAB SOME BREW OPEN IT UP AND TOP IT OFF
GW_3gR4MCZg_12 0 GIVE IT THAT BUBBLING BREW
GW_3gR4MCZg_13 0 THERE YOU GO A STRAW AND ENJOY
hBBid5RhYJk_1 0 THE NEXT STEP IN HELPING YOUR PET COPE WITH ARTHRITIS IN HIS SHOULDERS IS TO ACTUALLY MASSAGE BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES RIGHT UP AND DOWN THROUGH THIS AREA
hBBid5RhYJk_2 0 AND THE REASON FOR THIS IS WHEN ONE LEG IS INJURED WHEN THERE'S ARTHRITIS IN ONE SHOULDER THE OTHER LEG CARRIES MOST OF THE WEIGHT DOES EXTRA WORK
hBBid5RhYJk_3 0 THE BODY TENDS TO GET OUT OF PHYSICAL BALANCE SO THE DOG WILL STAND SLIGHTLY CROOKED PUTTING THE WEIGHT ON ONE LEG RATHER THAN THE OTHER
hBBid5RhYJk_4 0 BY MASSAGING THIS AREA IN BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES IT HELPS EASE SOME OF THE TENSION AS THE MUSCLES CAUSE THE MUSCLES TIGHTEN UP TO COMPENSATE SO YOU'RE WANTING TO MASSAGE THROUGH THERE AND THAT WILL EASE THAT TENSION AND HELP THE TWO LEGS TO BE MORE BALANCED TO HELP THE DOG STAND MORE EVENLY
hBBid5RhYJk_5 0 AND THAT WILL PUT LESS PRESSURE ON THE GOOD LEG AND ALLOW THEM TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE
hBBid5RhYJk_6 0 SO THAT'S ONE OF YOUR MOST IMPORTANT MASSAGE POINTS WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH A SHOULDER INJURY AND THIS HELPS KEEP THESE TWO SHOULDERS AT THE SAME HEIGHT
hBBid5RhYJk_7 0 WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN A DOG WHO HAS A PROBLEM IS ONE SHOULDER BONE WILL ACTUALLY SIT HIGHER THAN THE OTHER SO IF YOU FEEL IT YOU'LL FEEL ONE HIGHER THAN THE OTHER AND THAT'S WHEN THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT
gh_9utCgIrk_1 0 OK WE JUST TALKED ABOUT BEING PREPARED AND BY BEING PREPARED IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU RELAX AND IT'S ALSO GOING TO HELP THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE INTERVIEWING RELAX BY KNOWING THAT YOU'RE PREPARED
gh_9utCgIrk_2 0 BUT THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT AND IT'S CALLED NONVERBAL QUES
gh_9utCgIrk_3 0 WHAT NONVERBAL QUES ARE ARE SIGNS THAT YOU NEED TO WATCH FOR AS YOU'RE CONDUCTING THE INTERVIEW
gh_9utCgIrk_4 0 FOR EXAMPLE IF SOMEBODY DOES THIS THEY RAISE THEIR HAND IT MIGHT MEAN WAIT I'M NOT FINISHED OR IF THEY PUT THEIR HAND TOGETHER IT MIGHT MEAN I'M FINISHED AND THIS IS REAL IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO UTILIZE YOUR TIME
gh_9utCgIrk_5 0 YOU MAY NOT HAVE A LOT OF TIME WITH THIS PERSON AND YOU REALLY NEED TO UTILIZE THIS TIME TO GET ALL THE INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED
gh_9utCgIrk_6 0 SO YOU NEVER WANT THE PERSON TO FEEL LIKE THEY'VE BEEN CUT OFF AND YOU DON'T WANT LONG SILENCES EITHER
gh_9utCgIrk_7 0 SO BY HAVING THOSE QUESTIONS PREPARED AND LOOKING FOR THESE NONVERBAL QUES I'M FINISHED I'M NOT FINISHED CAN WE MOVE ON THEN YOU'LL CONDUCT A BETTER INTERVIEW
gjxaVVnqMQg_2 0 MY NAME IS HAROLD HALL FT LAUDERDALE ARCHERS IN FT LAUDERDALE FLORIDA AND TODAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT THAT YOU WOULD USE FOR ARCHERY
gjxaVVnqMQg_3 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME YOU
gjxaVVnqMQg_4 0 OKAY ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT TOOL THAT YOU NEED WELL ITS KIND OF HARD FOR A INDIVIDUAL TO BUY A TOOL LIKE THIS BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT WE USE WHEN WE USE WHEN WE REPAIR PEOPLE'S BOWS IT IS WHAT IS CALLED A BOW PRESS
gjxaVVnqMQg_5 0 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BOWS THAT COULD BE PUT IN THIS ANYWHERE FROM A SHORT BOW TO A LONG BOW
gjxaVVnqMQg_6 0 WITH THE STYLE OF BOWS NOW DAYS YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHAT TYPE OF PRESSURE YOU USE
gjxaVVnqMQg_7 0 SO IT HAS A SHELF ON IT YOU COULD PUT YOUR STUFF ON IT AND IT CRANKS DOWN BEND YOUR LIMBS SO THAT YOU CAN EITHER REMOVE YOUR STRING OR YOU KNOW REPLACE THAT TO MAYBE PUT IN A PEEP SITE TO TING SOMETHING ON YOUR STRING WHATEVER YOU NEED
gjxaVVnqMQg_8 0 SO YOU KNOW THAT IS ONE OF THE ASPECTS AND THE TOOLS THAT YOU MAY WANT
gGoFM4Q8n5E_1 0 ALONG WITH THE MOHAWK THE MOST KNOW SYMBOL OF PUNK FASHION HAS TO BE DOC MARTIN BOOTS OR DOC MARTIN STYLE BOOTS
gGoFM4Q8n5E_2 0 AND I'VE ACTUALLY GOT SOME HERE TO SHOW YOU
gGoFM4Q8n5E_3 0 FIRST OF ALL THEY SHOULD BE LEATHER AND THEY SHOULD HAVE A THICK SOLE
gGoFM4Q8n5E_4 0 THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A HEEL THEY CAN BE FLAT BOOTS BUT USUALLY THEY'RE THE STYLE OF MOTORCYCLE BOOTS
gGoFM4Q8n5E_5 0 SOMETIMES OR BOOTS THAT HAVE A STEEL TOE IN THE FRONT AND THE IDEA ONCE AGAIN WAS TO CONTRAST WITH THE FASHION OF THE TIME IN THE 70S AND THE 80S WHEN YOU KNOW PUNK WAS REALLY GETTING GOING WHICH NO ONE WOULD HAVE WORN ANYTHING LIKE THIS
gGoFM4Q8n5E_6 0 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOFT SHOES AND SOFT FABRICS
gGoFM4Q8n5E_7 0 DOC MARTINS ARE SORT OF KNOW TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PUNK SCENE BUT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY INTO CONSUMERS A LOT OF PUNKS WILL GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO WEAR SHOES THAT AREN'T A BRAND THAT PEOPLE KNOW BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT GETTING A CERTAIN BRAND IT'S ABOUT A CERTAIN STYLE
gGoFM4Q8n5E_8 0 THE OTHER REALLY POPULAR SHOE IS THE CHUCK TAYLOR
gGoFM4Q8n5E_9 0 I'M ACTUALLY WEARING THEM RIGHT NOW WITH SKINNIER JEANS WHICH ARE ALSO A STYLE
gGoFM4Q8n5E_10 0 I CAN SHOW YOU THEM RIGHT HERE
gGoFM4Q8n5E_11 0 THEY ARE NEAR THE STUFF I USED TO DO MY HAIR
gGoFM4Q8n5E_12 0 YOU KNOW AND CHUCK TAYLOR'S ARE REALLY REALLY POPULAR EVEN TODAY
gGoFM4Q8n5E_13 0 LOW-TOPS OR HIGH-TOPS DOESN'T MATTER
gGoFM4Q8n5E_14 0 IT WAS ACTUALLY FIRST POPULARIZED BY THE PUNK MOVEMENT AND THESE ARE BECAUSE THESE WERE REALLY BASIC CHEAP SNEAKERS THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T WEAR IN THE 70S AND 80S
gGoFM4Q8n5E_15 0 IT WAS IT WAS SORT OF THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR IN SNEAKERS AND IT WAS ONCE AGAIN TO SHOW HOW ANTI-CONSUMERIST PUNKS WERE
GI_l7c94yJY_2 0 THIS IS ALFRED ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GI_l7c94yJY_3 0 ALL RIGHT WHICH SHOULD YOU USE
GI_l7c94yJY_4 0 CASH CREDIT OR DEBIT
GI_l7c94yJY_5 0 ONE OF THE EASIEST WAYS TO KEEP TRACK OF YOUR SPENDING IS TO HAVE A CHECKING ACCOUNT
GI_l7c94yJY_6 0 THAT WAY WHEN YOU PAY FOR PURCHASES WITH CHECKS OR YOUR ATM OR DEBIT CARD YOU ALREADY HAVE A RECORD OF THEM
GI_l7c94yJY_7 0 THEN YOU NEED TO ONLY TRACK A FEW EXPENSES THAT YOU PAID FOR IN CASH
GI_l7c94yJY_8 0 WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HAVING A CHECKING ACCOUNT YOU MIGHT ASK
GI_l7c94yJY_9 0 IT IS SAFE
GI_l7c94yJY_10 0 IT IS MUCH SAFER TO WRITE A CHECK THAN TO CARRY CASH
GI_l7c94yJY_11 0 IF FOR EXAMPLE YOU LOOSE YOUR CHECKBOOK YOU CAN TELL THE BANK TO CANCEL YOUR CHECKS AND NO ONE ELSE CAN SPEND YOUR MONEY
GI_l7c94yJY_12 0 IT IS CONVENIENT
GI_l7c94yJY_13 0 CHECKING ACCOUNTS ARE ALSO CONVENIENT FOR PAYING BILLS
GI_l7c94yJY_14 0 PAYING BY CHECK IS MUCH EASIER AND CHEAPER THAN BUYING A MONEY ORDER AND YOU WILL HAVE PROOF THAT YOU PAID YOUR BILLS
GI_l7c94yJY_15 0 IN ADDITION TO WIRING CHECKS TO MAKE PURCHASES YOU CAN USE AN ATM DEBIT CARD AT ANY BANK MACHINE GROCERY STORE OR DRUGSTORE TO MAKE A PURCHASE
GI_l7c94yJY_16 0 SOME BANKS OFFER ON-LINE BANKING WHICH ALLOW YOU TO CHECK HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE IN YOUR ACCOUNT AND PAY BILLS ON LINE
GI_l7c94yJY_17 0 CREDIT CARDS CAN BE A GREAT TOOL WHEN USED PROPERLY
GI_l7c94yJY_18 0 MONTHLY STATEMENTS MAKE IT PRETTY EASY TO TRACK YOUR EXPENSES
GI_l7c94yJY_19 0 IT IS A BAD IDEA TO GET A CREDIT CARD OR LOAN WITHOUT HAVING A BUDGET OR SAVINGS ACCOUNT
GI_l7c94yJY_20 0 IF YOU LIKE THE CONCEPT OF A CREDIT CARD WITHOUT THE INTEREST THEN A DEBIT CARD IS A VERY GOOD OPTION
GI_l7c94yJY_21 0 WHEN IT COMES TO CASH IT IS HARD TO SPEND WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE
GI_l7c94yJY_22 0 AS WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE ENVELOPE SYSTEM SO YOU DO TEND TO SAVE MORE MONEY
GI_l7c94yJY_23 0 THE DOWNSIDE OF USING CASH IS THAT IT TAKES A LOT MORE DISCIPLINE TO KEEP TRACK OF YOUR CASH PURPOSES
H_c2dPdbRV8_1 0 HI I'M KARINA FRALEY FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE ARE MAKING HALLOWEEN THEMED PLACE MATS
H_c2dPdbRV8_2 0 SO WE HAVE MOVED ON TO OUR PUMPKIN PLACE MAT
H_c2dPdbRV8_3 0 I USE MY SEWING MACHINE FOR THIS ONE
H_c2dPdbRV8_4 0 IF YOU HAVE A SEWING MACHINE IT WILL BE VERY QUICK AND VERY EASY
H_c2dPdbRV8_5 0 IT'S A FUN LITTLE PROJECT
H_c2dPdbRV8_6 0 IF YOU'RE A NOVICE THIS IS A GREAT FIRST TIME PROJECT
H_c2dPdbRV8_7 0 YOU'LL BE VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE RESULTS
H_c2dPdbRV8_8 0 YOU'LL BE VERY PROUD OF YOURSELF AND YOUR FRIENDS WILL BE VERY IMPRESSED
H_c2dPdbRV8_9 0 SO BASICALLY WE'VE CUT OUR FABRIC AND WE'VE PUT THE RIGHT SIDES TOGETHER
H_c2dPdbRV8_10 0 THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FABRIC IS OBVIOUSLY THE FRONT
H_c2dPdbRV8_11 0 THE WRONG SIDE IS THE BACK
H_c2dPdbRV8_12 0 YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THE RIGHT SIDES OF BOTH FABRICS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE TOGETHER LIKE THAT
H_c2dPdbRV8_13 0 NOW WE ARE GOING TO SEW AROUND THE PERIMETER
H_c2dPdbRV8_14 0 YOU'VE WENT AHEAD AND PINNED THEM TOGETHER SO THAT THEY DON'T SLIDE AROUND
H_c2dPdbRV8_15 0 AND WE'RE BASICALLY JUST GOING TO SEW ALL AROUND THE EDGES
H_c2dPdbRV8_16 0 YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU LEAVE OPEN JUST ENOUGH OF AN OPENING SO THAT YOU CAN TURN YOUR PLACE MAT RIGHT SIDE OUT
H_c2dPdbRV8_17 0 BECAUSE WE ARE SEWING IT INSIDE OUT
H_c2dPdbRV8_18 0 YOU JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU MATCH WHATEVER THREAD COLOR YOU WANT TO USE
H_c2dPdbRV8_19 0 IF YOU WANT TO USE A CONTRASTING THREAD THAT'S FINE
H_c2dPdbRV8_20 0 BUT IF YOU WANT TO KEEP IT SORT OF MATCHING YOU CAN DO A NEUTRAL COLOR IN CASE ANY OF THE THREAD SHOWS
H_c2dPdbRV8_21 0 BUT AGAIN THIS IS GOING TO BE INSIDE OUT SO BECAUSE I'M USING A VERY LIGHT COLOR FOR THE BACKING A BLACK THREAD MIGHT SHOW
H_c2dPdbRV8_22 0 IF YOU'RE USING A BLACK FABRIC FOR THE BACK IT REALLY ALMOST DOESN'T MATTER WHAT COLOR THREAD YOU USE
H_c2dPdbRV8_23 0 I'M JUST GOING TO TURN ON MY MACHINE AND I HAVE FIRED UP MY IRON BECAUSE I'M GOING TO USE IT IN A MINUTE
H_c2dPdbRV8_24 0 SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO AHEAD AND GET YOUR IRON HEATED UP
H_c2dPdbRV8_25 0 I'M JUST GOING TO USE A I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO USE THIS EXACT STITCH FOR THIS
H_c2dPdbRV8_26 0 PUT THE FOOT DOWN
_HamZ9OFp-4_1 0 MIKE LOPEZ HI
_HamZ9OFp-4_2 0 I'M MIKE LOPEZ WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING THE BLACK COLOR FROM MAGIC THE GATHERING
_HamZ9OFp-4_3 0 AND NOW I'M GOING TO DISCUSS DEATHMARK DEATHMARK IS A POWERFUL CARD POWERFUL SORCERY OUT OF THE BLACK COLOR FROM THE COLDSNAP EXPANSION
_HamZ9OFp-4_4 0 IT COSTS YOU EIGHT BLACK TO PLAY AND WHAT THIS DOES IS THAT IT DESTROYS TARGET GREEN OR WHITE CREATURE
_HamZ9OFp-4_5 0 NOW ONCE AGAIN THIS DESTRUCTION IS A DESTRUCTIVE EFFECT IT'S NOT DAMAGE SO IT CANNOT BE PREVENTED AND THAT CREATURE CANNOT BE REGENERATED BECAUSE IT SAYS DESTROY AND YOU DESTROY TARGET GREEN OR WHITE CREATURE
_HamZ9OFp-4_6 0 THIS IS CREATURE SPECIFIC FOR COLOR WHICH MEANS YOU WOULD PUT THIS IN YOUR SIDEBOARD TO YOUR MAIN DECK AND IF YOU RUN ACROSS SOMEONE WHO IS RUNNING HEAVY GREEN OR WHITE CREATURES THEN YOU WOULD PLACE THIS CARD IN THERE AND BASICALLY YOU'RE GETTING A FREE TEAR BECAUSE TEAR COST YOU ONE AND A BLACK AND THIS ONLY COST YOU A BLACK TO DESTROY TARGET GREEN OR WHITE CREATURE
_HamZ9OFp-4_7 0 VERY CHEAP VERY POWERFUL CARD
h14plF-Ndks_1 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO SOME LATERAL RAISES WITH OUR EXERCISE TUBING
h14plF-Ndks_2 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO START OFF BY JUST STEPPING AWAY
h14plF-Ndks_3 0 OH YEAH I'M GETTING A WORKOUT TODAY ON THIS LITTLE STAIRMASTER
h14plF-Ndks_4 0 AND NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR TUBING PUT IT IN OUR HANDS WANT TO RELAX OUR SHOULDERS BELLYBUTTON'S INTO THE SPINE MY POSTURE IS GOOD
h14plF-Ndks_5 0 REMEMBER ALWAYS HAVE GOOD POSTURE
h14plF-Ndks_6 0 AND THEN YOU WANT TO TAKE THOSE ARMS AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME ON UP
h14plF-Ndks_7 0 WORKING ON THAT LATERAL RAISE
h14plF-Ndks_8 0 I CAN FEEL IT IN MY DELTOIDS
h14plF-Ndks_10 0 WE'RE WORKING OUR DELTS JUST LIKE WE DID BEFORE ONLY WE DID THEM IN THE FRONT
h14plF-Ndks_11 0 WE'RE DOING THEM TO THE SIDE BRING THEM ON UP
h14plF-Ndks_12 0 SLIGHT BEND YOU WANT TO HAVE A SLIGHT BEND IN THOSE ELBOWS
h14plF-Ndks_13 0 AND IF YOU WANT YOU CAN BRING ONE UP AND THEN ALTERNATE
h14plF-Ndks_14 0 AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE GOING FOR
h14plF-Ndks_15 0 SOMETIMES IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT MORE COORDINATION TO DO ONE AT A TIME
h14plF-Ndks_16 0 IT TAKES A LITTLE MORE WIND A LITTLE MORE CARDIO TO DO TWO AT A TIME
h14plF-Ndks_17 0 IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE GOING FOR
h14plF-Ndks_18 0 BUT WHAT A GREAT WORKOUT YOU CAN GET ON A LITTLE STAIRMASTER LIKE THIS
h14plF-Ndks_19 0 JUST A FEW MORE AND I'LL BE AS BUFF AS ONE OF THOSE GLADIATORS
h14plF-Ndks_21 0 REMEMBER KEEP THOSE ELBOWS SOFT SLIGHT BEND IN THEM
h14plF-Ndks_22 0 AND THERE WE GO
h14plF-Ndks_23 0 THAT'S HOW YOU DO THE LATERAL RAISE ON THE STAIRMASTER
GvEe09hFKp4_1 0 HI I'M RISHABH JAIN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE IN THE CLIP I WILL TELL YOU HOW TO SET A DIAMOND IN A JEWELRY
GvEe09hFKp4_2 0 THERE ARE DIFFERENT KIND OF SETTINGS BEFORE WE TAKE CARE BEFORE WE SET A DIAMOND IN A JEWELRY
GvEe09hFKp4_3 0 I'LL EXPLAIN A FEW OF THEM WHICH ARE MOST IMPORTANT AND ARE COMMONLY USED
GvEe09hFKp4_4 0 HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE FIRST IS GEMSTONE SETTING
GvEe09hFKp4_5 0 IN THIS SETTING A DIAMOND IS SET WITH A LITTLE METAL AROUND IT WITH NO GAPS
GvEe09hFKp4_6 0 THE SECOND SETTING IS POCKET SETTING IN THIS SETTING THE DIAMONDS ARE SET ONE AFTER ANOTHER WITH PRONGS FOR EACH DIAMOND
GvEe09hFKp4_7 0 THIRD IS PRONG SETTING
GvEe09hFKp4_8 0 IN THIS SETTING THE DIAMOND HAS GOT PRONGS ON THE SIDES OF IT
GvEe09hFKp4_9 0 NEXT IS CHANNEL SETTING IN THIS SETTING THIS SETTING IS BASICALLY DONE IN LONGER DIAMONDS THOSE ARE RECTANGULAR DIAMONDS
GvEe09hFKp4_10 0 THAN GOES INVISIBLE SETTING IN THIS SETTING THE METAL IS ONLY ON THE OUTER DIAMONDS AND THE INNER DIAMONDS ARE ON THE SUPPORT OF THE OUTER DIAMONDS
GvEe09hFKp4_11 0 THAN COMES THE TENSION SETTING
GvEe09hFKp4_12 0 IN THIS SETTING THERES NO METAL LIKE WE HAD IN PRONG
GvEe09hFKp4_13 0 ITS ONLY THE GROVES ON THE SIDES OF THE METAL IN WHICH THE DIAMOND IS BEING SET
GvEe09hFKp4_14 0 AND THE LAST SETTING IS CLUSTER SETTING IN THIS SETTING THERE IS ONE DIAMOND IN THE CENTER AND THE REST ARE AROUND IT
GvEe09hFKp4_15 0 SO THESE ARE A FEW SETTING OF WHAT WE DO BASICALLY IN JEWELRY NOW I SHOW YOU A SAMPLE A JEWELRY SAMPLE
GvEe09hFKp4_16 0 IN WHICH I SHOW YOU TWO OF THE SETTING ONE IS PROPER SETTING AND ONE IS STRONG SETTING
GvEe09hFKp4_17 0 NOW IN THIS PIECE YOU CAN SEE THE DIAMONDS ON THESE SIDES THESE ARE STRONG SETTINGS AND YOU CAN SEE THIS WHITE LINE OF DIAMONDS COMING OUT THIS IS PROPER SETTING
GvEe09hFKp4_18 0 SETTING A DIAMOND IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF JEWELRY
GvEe09hFKp4_19 0 IF IT IS SET UP PROPERLY WITH GOOD MAKE THE JEWELRY WILL GIVE YOU GOOD SHINE AND LUSTRE
GvEe09hFKp4_20 0 HOPE THIS WILL HELP YOU FIND A GOOD JEWELRY
GkZV7uVZcIc_1 0 SO NOW WE HAVE ANOTHER PUPPY HERE AND ACTUALLY THIS PUPPY IF YOU LOOK AT HIM YOU MAY NOT EVEN IMAGINE THAT HE IS A PUPPY RIGHT AWAY BUT JUST LIKE BABIES HUMAN BABIES THEY GROW AND THEY CHANGE CONSIDERABLY AND WE STARTED OFF WITH A TWELVE DAY OLD PUPPY THEN WE LOOKED AT AN EIGHT WEEK OLD PUPPY AND NOW WE HAVE A MUCH OLDER PUPPY
GkZV7uVZcIc_2 0 YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS ONE IS NOT ACTING AS MUCH OF A PUPPY AND DEFINITELY HAS MORE FEATURES OF AN ADULT BUT WE KNOW IT IS A PUPPY BY AGAIN THE TEETH
GkZV7uVZcIc_3 0 THE TEETH ARE A CLUE FOR AGE IN A PUPPY
GkZV7uVZcIc_4 0 YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE TEETH AND THAT WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD SENSE OF HOW OLD THE DOG IS
GkZV7uVZcIc_5 0 SO WITH THIS DOG HERE IF I LOOK AT HIS TEETH YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THAT THE INSIDES OF ALL OF THE TEETH HAVE COME IN AND THESE ARE ADULT TEETH
GkZV7uVZcIc_6 0 YOU CAN TELL THAT THEY'RE ADULT TEETH BECAUSE THEY ARE MUCH WIDER AND HEAVIER AND THICKER THAN PUPPY TEETH
GkZV7uVZcIc_7 0 PUPPY TEETH ARE VERY NARROW AND SMALLER AND THESE ARE WIDER BUT I CAN SEE IN THE BACK HERE THAT THOSE MOLARS ARE NOT COMPLETELY IN YET THEY'RE STILL COMING IN AND STILL PUSHING THROUGH
GkZV7uVZcIc_8 0 A DOG GETS ALL OF ITS TEETH AT ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS OF AGE SO THIS DOG SINCE NOT ALL OF ITS TEETH ARE COMPLETELY IN THIS DOG IS JUST A LITTLE BIT UNDER SEVEN MONTHS OF AGE SO THAT GIVES US A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT THE AGE RANGE OF THIS DOG IS SO ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS OF AGE
GK_e19QGtoI_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING NOW ABOUT THE WARMING UP
GK_e19QGtoI_2 0 WARMING UP IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF TENNIS
GK_e19QGtoI_3 0 BESIDES THAT YOU NEED TO WARM UP YOUR BODY TENNIS IS A VERY HIGH IMPACT SPORT TO THE POINT THAT IT'S HARD ON YOUR KNEES HARD ON YOUR ELBOWS
GK_e19QGtoI_4 0 SO IF YOU START COOL AND YOU START IMPACTING YOUR MUSCLES IT'S GOING TO BE BAD FOR YOU
GK_e19QGtoI_5 0 YOU WANT TO START SLOW WARMING UP YOUR BODY WARMING EVERYTHING UP TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T RUN INTO ANY INJURIES
GK_e19QGtoI_6 0 ANOTHER ADVANTAGE OF WARMING UP IS THAT PUTS YOU ON A MENTAL MOVIE PUTS YOU ON THE COMPETITION MENTAL GAME
GK_e19QGtoI_7 0 ALRIGHT I'M GOING TO BE WORKING I NEED TO WARM UP
GK_e19QGtoI_8 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE PLAYING A MATCH TRY TO COME TO THE TENNIS COURT AND WARM UP THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE AT LEAST FIFTEEN MINUTES SO YOU HAVE GOOD TEN MINUTES TO WARM UP YOUR BODY BEFORE YOU START WITH A MATCH
GK_e19QGtoI_9 0 BECAUSE NORMALLY ON A TENNIS MATCH YOU ONLY HAVE FIVE MINUTES WARM UP
HhmSwhYznOE_1 0 THIS EXERCISE IS CALLED THE SIDE PLANK AND THIS IS A GREAT EXERCISE THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED FROM YOGA SO WE ARE GOING TO INCORPORATE THE CORE AND WE ARE GOING TO WORK ON BALANCE STABILITY STRENGTH ALL THAT GREAT STUFF TO MAKE US NICE AND TALL IN OUR POSTURE AND YOU WANT TO COME TO THE STAIRS AND JUST PLACE YOUR HAND ON ONE OF THE STEPS AND KIND OF WALK YOUR FEET OUT AND YOU WANT TO LIFT THROUGH YOUR TORSO HERE EXTEND YOUR TOP ARM UP TOWARDS THE CEILING AND JUST HOLD THIS POSITION AND YOU CAN HOLD THIS POSITION FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS TO A MINUTE
HhmSwhYznOE_2 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR HAND IS DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH YOUR SHOULDER
HhmSwhYznOE_3 0 IF YOU HAVE ANY WRIST ISSUES OR SHOULDER ISSUES THEN THIS MAY BOTHER YOU SO YOU JUST WANT TO KIND OF RELEASE OUT OF THAT
HhmSwhYznOE_4 0 IF YOU NEED TO MODIFY JUST LOWER DOWN ONE KNEE AND SIDE PLANK HERE
HhmSwhYznOE_5 0 YOU CAN PERFORM THIS POSE FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS TO A MINUTE AND THEN SIMPLY SWITCH SIDES AND THAT IS YOUR SIDE PLANK AND WORK THAT CORE
GCz6XNWe8k4_1 0 HI I'M DR GARRETT SMITH FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
GCz6XNWe8k4_2 0 THIS EXERCISE THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER NOW IS CALLED SIDE LUNGES
GCz6XNWe8k4_3 0 ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT LUNGES IS THAT THEY CAN BE PRETTY MUCH DONE IN ANY DIRECTION YOU WANT
GCz6XNWe8k4_4 0 THE MAJOR ONES BEING FRONT REAR AND SIDE
GCz6XNWe8k4_5 0 IMPORTANT THINGS ON SIDE LUNGES IS THE FEET STAY STRAIGHT AHEAD
GCz6XNWe8k4_6 0 WE DON'T WANT TO BE TURNING OUR FEET OUT TO STEP OUT
GCz6XNWe8k4_7 0 THE POINT IS TO KEEP THEM STRAIGHT AHEAD WHEN WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE
GCz6XNWe8k4_8 0 THE OTHER THING IS THAT IN ALL OF OUR EXERCISES IS THAT THE KNEE STAYS OVER THE TOES OF THE LEAD LEG
GCz6XNWe8k4_9 0 THE LEAD LEG IS GOING TO BE THE ONE I'M GOING TO STEP WITH IN THIS IT'S GOING TO BE THE RIGHT
GCz6XNWe8k4_10 0 HERE'S WHAT ONE LOOKS LIKE
GCz6XNWe8k4_11 0 I'M GOING TO GO OUT AND STAY IN THE BOTTOM POSITION
GCz6XNWe8k4_12 0 THE KNEE STAYS OUT OVER THE FEET FEET ARE RELATIVELY STRAIGHT AHEAD BACK LEG IS STRAIGHT AND THEN WE PUSH BACK UP TO THE MIDDLE POSITION
GCz6XNWe8k4_13 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THAT ONE BECAUSE I WAS DEMONSTRATING SOMETHING THERE I BENT MY BACK A LITTLE BIT I WANT TO SHOW YOU ONE REALLY CORRECT
GCz6XNWe8k4_14 0 FEET STEPS OUT BACK STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN
GCz6XNWe8k4_15 0 I DON'T WANT YOU GOING DOWN WHERE YOUR BACK BENDS LIKE THIS
GCz6XNWe8k4_16 0 I WANT YOU TO KEEP A NICE NEUTRAL SPINE AND THEN STEP BACK
GCz6XNWe8k4_17 0 YOU CAN ALTERNATE SIDES OR YOU CAN DO ALL ON ONE SIDE LIKE I'M DOING NOW
GCz6XNWe8k4_18 0 SAME THINGS AS ANY OTHER LUNGE IT'S JUST WE'RE STEPPING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION USING OUR ARMS FOR BALANCE
GCz6XNWe8k4_19 0 TOUGHER TO ADD WEIGHTS TO THIS ONE
GCz6XNWe8k4_20 0 CAN BE DONE
GCz6XNWe8k4_21 0 BARBELL ACROSS THE BACK
GCz6XNWe8k4_22 0 DUMBBELLS DON'T REALLY WORK TOO WELL BECAUSE OUR LEGS GET IN THE WAY
GCz6XNWe8k4_23 0 OTHER THING FOR THOSE OF YOU INTERESTED IN IT SIDE LUNGES WORK THE ADDUCTOR'S THE INNER THIGH MUSCLES A LOT
GCz6XNWe8k4_24 0 THEY'RE GREAT AT STRENGTHENING THOSE INNER THIGH MUSCLES
GCz6XNWe8k4_25 0 IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN STRENGTHENING THOSE THEY CAN BE A GREAT ADDITION TO YOUR REGIMENT
GCz6XNWe8k4_26 0 THAT'S SIDE LUNGES
GbkJk6a3eRE_1 0 SO NOW I'VE MEASURED OUT ALL THE INGREDIENTS AND COLORANTS FOR A 15,000 GRAM BATCH OF GLAZE
GbkJk6a3eRE_2 0 I HAD THE WATER IN THERE ALREADY SO I ADDED THE INGREDIENTS TO THE WATER AND THEY'VE ALL SETTLED DOWN INTO THE WATER
GbkJk6a3eRE_3 0 YOU WANT TO LET THAT HAPPEN BEFORE YOU START DRILL MIXING
GbkJk6a3eRE_4 0 AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A DRILL MIXER
GbkJk6a3eRE_5 0 JUST A REGULAR DRILL AND THEN YOU CAN BUY THIS IS MADE FOR DRYWALL
GbkJk6a3eRE_6 0 THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE MADE SPECIFICALLY FOR MIXING GLAZES THAT DON'T DRAW AIR IN
GbkJk6a3eRE_7 0 THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE SO I JUST WENT TO MY HARDWARE STORE AND BOUGHT A DRYWALL DRILL MIXER
GbkJk6a3eRE_8 0 AND THEN YOU JUST WANT TO PUT THAT RIGHT DOWN INTO THE MIDDLE OF YOUR MIXTURE
GbkJk6a3eRE_9 0 AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MIX FOR A LITTLE WHILE UNTIL YOU SEE THAT IT'S A PRETTY WELL MIXED MIXTURE
GbkJk6a3eRE_10 0 SO THAT'S PRETTY GOOD
GbkJk6a3eRE_11 0 THE NEXT STEP IS GOING TO BE ACTUALLY SIEVING THIS THROUGH A NICE SCREEN TO GET IT REALLY EVEN TO MAKE SURE THE PARTICLES ARE ALL SMALL AND THEN WE CAN START TESTING WITH THIS GLAZE

gJnmt6P5x2A_1 0 ALRIGHT NOW WE ARE DOING SOME OF MY CLASSES FAVORITE THINGS
gJnmt6P5x2A_2 0 THEY LOVE THESE
gJnmt6P5x2A_3 0 THEY ACTUALLY HATE THESE WHICH IS WHY I LOVE THEM
gJnmt6P5x2A_4 0 MAKE SURE YOU ARE ENGAGED
gJnmt6P5x2A_5 0 YOU ARE GOING TO DO A ROTATION THROUGH THE LEGS AND YOU ARE GOING TO ROTATE THE HECK OUT OF IT
gJnmt6P5x2A_6 0 YOU ARE GOING TO BRING THE HEEL UP AND BACK DOWN AND I SHOW YOU WITH MY ARM BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE SOMETIMES IN OUR HEADS
gJnmt6P5x2A_7 0 THIS IS HOW IT LOOKS WHEN YOU ARE DOING IT THE WAY I WANT YOU TO DO IT
gJnmt6P5x2A_8 0 LYING OUT LEGS EXTENDED INHALE BIG EXHALE STAY ENGAGED
gJnmt6P5x2A_9 0 FLEX FEET HAND IN FRONT FOR SUPPORT
gJnmt6P5x2A_10 0 NOW YOUR HEEL IS GOING TO LEAD THE MOVEMENT WHETHER IT IS UP OR DOWN IT STARTS WITH THE ROTATION HEEL LEAD
gJnmt6P5x2A_11 0 YOU ARE GOING TO TURN THE TOE DOWN TO LEAD THE HEEL UP AND IT DOESN'T GO HIGH
gJnmt6P5x2A_12 0 HEEL LEADS UP AND WHEN IT GETS TO THE UP POSITION YOU ARE GOING TO ROTATE IT AND THE HEEL COMES BACK DOWN
gJnmt6P5x2A_13 0 THE HIGHER THE LEG GOES THE MORE YOU NEED TO FIGHT TO KEEP THE MOUSE HOUSE OFF THE FLOOR
gJnmt6P5x2A_14 0 IF I BRING IT UP TOO HIGH THE MOUSE HOUSE GOES DOWN I'M NOT ENGAGED
gJnmt6P5x2A_15 0 IF IT'S EASY IT'S NOT DONE RIGHT SO STAY ENGAGED ROTATE HEEL UP SWITCH HEEL DOWN AND AGAIN HEEL UP HEEL DOWN
gJnmt6P5x2A_16 0 MAKE SURE YOU ARE BREATHING AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO YOUR HEEL LEADS
GtpJEzI7NeE_1 0 HOW MUCH DO YOU CHARGE PEOPLE FOR YOUR TIME
GtpJEzI7NeE_2 0 IT'S REAL EASY TO FIGURE SOMETHING LIKE THAT OUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A CD A TEE-SHIRT THAT YOU'VE MADE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A FIXED COST AND YOU WORKED ON IT AND YOU DESIGNED IT
GtpJEzI7NeE_3 0 YOU WOULD NORMALLY PAY A DESIGNER FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT EASIER BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING WELL IN GENERAL I WANT TO DOUBLE THE PRICE OF MY COSTS RIGHT
GtpJEzI7NeE_4 0 BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING WHERE I JUST SHOW UP AND I'M TALKING TO YOU FOR A WHILE HOW DO I DECIDE
GtpJEzI7NeE_5 0 HOW MUCH DO I CHARGE SOMEONE FOR THAT
GtpJEzI7NeE_6 0 WELL IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THAT TO LOOK AT HOW MUCH AM I PLANNING ON MAKING IN A YEAR
GtpJEzI7NeE_7 0 WHAT ARE MY NEEDS FOR ACTUALLY SURVIVING
GtpJEzI7NeE_8 0 HOW MANY SHOWS AM I PLANNING ON DOING IN A YEAR
GtpJEzI7NeE_9 0 IF I SAY FOR INSTANCE OKAY I'M PLANNING ON PERFORMING 100 SHOWS IN A YEAR
GtpJEzI7NeE_10 0 WELL IF I WANTED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DECENT MONEY I'M GOING TO HAVE TO AT LEAST SET A PRICE OF SOMEWHERE AROUND $500
GtpJEzI7NeE_11 0 LET'S MULTIPLY THAT OUT $500 TIMES 100 SHOWS THAT'S $50 000 IN A YEAR
GtpJEzI7NeE_12 0 SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD RIGHT
GtpJEzI7NeE_13 0 THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT YOU'RE NOT ALWAYS GOING TO GET YOUR $500 FOR THE SHOW YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE 100 SHOWS AND THEN ALSO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE LOTS OF EXPENSES THAT COME IN THERE
GtpJEzI7NeE_14 0 IF YOU'RE ONLY BRINGING IN $50 000 AND YOUR EXPENSES ARE $20 000 SUDDENLY YOU'RE NOT MAKING $50 000 YOU'RE MAKING $30 000
GtpJEzI7NeE_15 0 SO YOU NEED TO DECIDE HEY WHAT IS IT WORTH WHAT DO I NEED TO MAKE

GtpJEzI7NeE_17 0 YOU NEED TO VALUE YOURSELF AND VALUE YOUR TIME
GtpJEzI7NeE_18 0 WHEN PEOPLE SAY HOW MUCH SHOULD I PAY YOU
GtpJEzI7NeE_19 0 THEN WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE READY FOR THEM IS WHAT I USUALLY GET IS $800 FOR A SHOW
GtpJEzI7NeE_20 0 I CAN GO AS LOW AS $500 BUT I NEED TO AT LEAST MAKE THAT MUCH AND PEOPLE NORMALLY PAY ME $800
GtpJEzI7NeE_21 0 DO PEOPLE NORMALLY PAY YOU
GtpJEzI7NeE_22 0 I DON'T KNOW
GtpJEzI7NeE_23 0 BUT YOU TELL THEM THAT THAT'S YOUR NORMAL PRICE AND THEN IF THEY AT LEAST PAY YOUR $500 PRICE YOU'RE OKAY

H4pKtD-UmGM_10 0 LIKE I SAID YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO BEAT THE HECK OUT OF IT THAT YOU'RE TAKING CHUNKS OF WOOD OUT JUST WANT TO SLAP
H4pKtD-UmGM_11 0 AGAIN YOU COULD DO THIS WITH KEYS A SET OF KEYS OR EVEN JUST PUTTING SOME SCREWS IN A SOCK BUT THIS IS AN OLD TRICK THAT MY UNCLE TAUGHT ME MANY YEARS AGO WHEN YOU WERE TRYING TO MAKE THINGS LOOK ANTIQUE
H4pKtD-UmGM_12 0 YOU ALWAYS WANT TO DO BY THE AREAS WHERE THE DOOR HANDLES ARE YOU WANT TO REALLY GET THEM WORKED ON
H4pKtD-UmGM_13 0 I'LL SHOW YOU LATER WHAT I MEAN AS I GET THE DOORS ON

H764PyicDGo_1 0 IN THIS SERIES WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT SOME MORE ADVANCED CLUB JUGGLING TRICKS
H764PyicDGo_2 0 NOW CLUB JUGGLING TRICKS ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM BALL JUGGLING TRICKS
H764PyicDGo_3 0 AGAIN LIKE THREE BALLS THERE ARE A MILLION THREE CLUB TRICKS AND A MILLION VARIATIONS ON EACH INDIVIDUAL TRICK
H764PyicDGo_4 0 YOU DON'T NEED TO LEARN THEM ALL AND YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE YOUR OWN SPIN ON EACH INDIVIDUAL TRICK
H764PyicDGo_5 0 YOU DO IT YOUR OWN WAY
H764PyicDGo_6 0 JUGGLING IS A VERY MALLEABLE PERFORMANCE AND SPORT ACTIVITY
H764PyicDGo_7 0 ONE THING YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE IS YOU DON'T GET DISCOURAGED WITH SOME OF THESE TRICKS
H764PyicDGo_8 0 SOME OF THEM WILL NOT WORK AT FIRST
H764PyicDGo_9 0 SOME OF THEM WILL NOT WORK FOR MONTHS BUT THEN IF YOU PRACTICE THEM ENOUGH THEY WILL WORK
H764PyicDGo_10 0 ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS PUT SOME TIME INTO IT PUT SOME EFFORT INTO IT AND LEARN HOW TO DO EACH INDIVIDUAL TRICK PART BY PART
H764PyicDGo_11 0 THINK ABOUT BREAKING IT DOWN
H764PyicDGo_12 0 THINK ABOUT THE TECHNIQUE OF YOUR THROWS AND MAKE SURE YOU KEEP YOUR POSTURE THE SAME
H764PyicDGo_13 0 SO YOU WANT TO HAVE SHOULDER WIDTH APART WITH YOUR FEET STRAIGHT BACK ARMS AT NINETY DEGREES YOU WANT TO KEEP EVERYTHING GOOD
H764PyicDGo_14 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO LET YOUR THROWS EVOLVE INTO BAD THROWS AND JUST PRACTICE EACH TRICK PART BY PART AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PULL IT TOGETHER
gCqmjWeqtY4_1 0 OKAY IN THIS NEXT CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE ACTUAL DOOR HANDLE AND HOW TO PROTECT THAT AND HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S PAINTED CORRECTLY SO THAT THE DOOR LOOKS GOOD
gCqmjWeqtY4_2 0 BECAUSE THAT'S THE END QUALITY
gCqmjWeqtY4_3 0 YOU REALLY WANT THIS DOOR TO LOOK GOOD AND THE DOOR HANDLE IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT GETS THE MOST USE
gCqmjWeqtY4_4 0 WHETHER YOU HAVE KIDS OR A BUNCH OF PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF THIS DOOR IT'S GOING TO SEE ITS ABUSE AND THE PAINT AROUND IT WILL SEE ITS ABUSE
gCqmjWeqtY4_5 0 YOU CAN USE YOUR SCREWDRIVER AND ACTUALLY TAKE THE DOOR HANDLE OFF IF YOU KNOW HOW
gCqmjWeqtY4_6 0 IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW A DOOR HANDLE WORKS I DON'T RECOMMEND IT BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE THIS GREAT TAPE CALLED PAINTER'S TAPE AND YOU SIMPLY WRAP IT AROUND THERE AND PROTECT THE HANDLE
gCqmjWeqtY4_7 0 NOW WHAT I DO RECOMMEND IS BECAUSE THIS IS THE GARAGE THIS HOMEOWNER HAS AN ACTUAL CHAIN LOCK ON THEIR DOOR
gCqmjWeqtY4_8 0 WHEN THE DOOR TRIM WAS PAINTED IT WAS ACTUALLY TAKEN OFF
gCqmjWeqtY4_9 0 SO WHAT I DO SUGGEST IS THAT WITH THIS THERE'S FOUR SCREWS USE YOUR PHILLIP'S HEAD SCREWDRIVER AND SIMPLY REMOVE THAT FROM THE DOOR
gCqmjWeqtY4_11 0 JUST MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FILL UP THE HOLES WITH THE PAINT
gCqmjWeqtY4_12 0 MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE THOSE HOLES THERE SO THAT IT'S EASY TO PUT BACK ONCE THE DOOR IS DRY
gCqmjWeqtY4_13 0 WE'LL JUST TAKE THIS OFF AND WE'LL BE READY TO START PRIMING
gCqmjWeqtY4_14 0 ANOTHER GOOD TIP FOR YOU IS ONCE YOU GET ALL THIS OFF AND YOU HAVE YOUR SCREWS AND YOUR HARDWARE IS GET YOU A LITTLE CUP AND PUT EVERYTHING IN THERE
gCqmjWeqtY4_15 0 THAT WAY YOU'RE SURE NOT TO LOSE ANY OF THAT HARDWARE AND IT GOES RIGHT BACK UP WHEN YOU'RE READY

GaEz7YxBy0Y_1 0 ONCE YOU HAVE DISMOUNTED IT IS IMPORTANT TO RUN YOUR STIRRUPS BACK UP
GaEz7YxBy0Y_2 0 WITH YOUR STIRRUPS DOWN THEY CAN EASILY BE CAUGHT AND ANYTHING YOU ARE WALKING BY
GaEz7YxBy0Y_3 0 BY RUNNING THEM UP YOU ARE ENSURING THAT THEY STAY CLOSE TO THE SADDLE AND NOT GET CAUGHT IN ANYTHING
GaEz7YxBy0Y_4 0 SO TO RUN THE STIRRUPS UP I'M ONCE AGAIN GOING TO PUT MY LEFT ARM THROUGH THE REIN
GaEz7YxBy0Y_5 0 I'M GOING TO RUN THE STIRRUP BACK STRAP OF THE STIRRUP LEATHER AND YOU ARE GOING TO RUN BOTH STRAPS THROUGH THE MIDDLE

GaEz7YxBy0Y_7 0 SO ARMS THROUGH THE REINS LIFT THE STIRRUPS IRON ALL THE WAY UP THE BACK STIRRUP LEATHER AND INSERT THE ENTIRE STIRRUP LEATHER THROUGH THE MIDDLE
GaEz7YxBy0Y_8 0 IF YOU LIKE TO KEEP YOUR STIRRUP LEATHER EXTREMELY NEAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY WRAP THE STIRRUP LEATHER TWICE AROUND
GaEz7YxBy0Y_9 0 STICK THE EXTRA PART OF THE STIRRUP LEATHER THROUGH THE MIDDLE AND TUCK IT BACK INTO ITS KEEPER

H2qIbbLJG9M_1 0 HEY GUYS WHAT'S UP
H2qIbbLJG9M_2 0 THIS IS JACOB AT THE SKATEBOARDING SKATEBOARD PARK IN HEMPSTEAD NORTH CAROLINA
H2qIbbLJG9M_3 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO DO A FIVE ZERO GRINDING ON A SKATEBOARD
H2qIbbLJG9M_4 0 WHEN DOING A FIVE ZERO GRIND THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO DO FIRST
H2qIbbLJG9M_5 0 I WOULD RECOMMEND KNOWING HOW TO DROP IN AND ALSO KNOWING HOW TO DO AN AXLE STALL
H2qIbbLJG9M_6 0 LEARNING HOW TO DO A MANUAL WILL HELP SOME TOO WITH YOUR BALANCE
H2qIbbLJG9M_7 0 WHEN APPROACHING THE RAMP YOU WANT TO HAVE A GOOD ANGLE WITH YOUR SKATEBOARD THE MAJORITY OF YOUR WEIGHT SHOULD BE ON YOUR BACK FOOT
H2qIbbLJG9M_8 0 AS YOU APPROACH THE RAMP LIFT UP ON YOUR FRONT WHEELS CLEARING THE COPING UNTIL YOU HEAR THE CLICK OF YOUR BACK TRUCKS ON THE COPING
H2qIbbLJG9M_9 0 YOU THEN STAY BALANCED ON YOUR BACK FOOT WITH ALL OF YOUR WEIGHT GRINDING ON ONE TRUCK
H2qIbbLJG9M_10 0 WHEN YOU REACH THE END OF YOUR GRIND AND YOU'VE LOST THE MAJORITY OF YOUR MOMENTUM YOU THEN WANT TO TURN THE NOSE OF THE BOARD BACK INTO THE RAMP ROLLING YOUR WHEELS OVER THE COPING ENSURING THAT YOU DO NOT HANG UP AND ROLL IN COMPLETING THE FIVE ZERO GRIND
H2qIbbLJG9M_11 0 I'LL NOW DEMONSTRATE HOW TO DO A FIVE ZERO GRIND
H2qIbbLJG9M_12 0 THAT'S HOW YOU DO A FIVE ZERO GRIND ON A SKATEBOARD
HbhV3Pw0ZkA_1 0 HI I'M HARVEY WOODYATT OWNER OF PERFECT TAN HERE IN OREM UTAH
HbhV3Pw0ZkA_2 0 WE'RE A FULL SERVICE TANNING SALON
HbhV3Pw0ZkA_3 0 WE HAVE OVER TWENTY TANNING BEDS AS WELL AS A STATE OF THE ART SPRAY-ON SYSTEM LIKE I'M STANDING NEXT TO HERE
HbhV3Pw0ZkA_4 0 PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ME YOU KNOW CAN I GET TAN IF IT'S CLOUDY OUTSIDE AND THE ANSWER IS YES
HbhV3Pw0ZkA_5 0 THE UV RAYS CAN DEFINITELY PENETRATE THE SUN
HbhV3Pw0ZkA_6 0 SOMETIMES YOU GET THAT SECURITY FEELING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY BECAUSE IT'S CLOUDY OUTSIDE AND THEN PEOPLE DON'T USE SUNBLOCK
HbhV3Pw0ZkA_7 0 SO YOU HAVE TO GOT REMEMBER IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S CLOUDY OR IF IT'S SUNNY ALWAYS USE OUTSIDE GOOD SPF HIGH SUNBLOCK OR SUNSCREEN AND WHEN YOU'RE DOING ANYTHING OUTSIDE
HbhV3Pw0ZkA_8 0 AND WHEN YOU'RE TANNING INDOORS IN A TANNING SALON LIKE OURS YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE WEATHER BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME TEMPERATURE IN THE TANNING SALON
HbhV3Pw0ZkA_9 0 IT'S A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN A SECURE TANNING ROOM WE'RE GOING TO SET THE TIME FOR NO MORE THAN TWENTY MINUTES OR WHATEVER THE BED IS RECOMMENDED AT AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET A NICE EVEN TAN WITHOUT ANY KIND OF OVEREXPOSURE
HbhV3Pw0ZkA_10 0 BUT OUTSIDE YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET BECAUSE EVERYBODY TENDS TO LOSE TRACK OF THE TIME OR HOW LONG THEY'VE BEEN OUT THERE AND THEN PEOPLE GET SUN BURNT AND OVEREXPOSED
GQCo8slgt-0_1 0 ALRIGHT YOU ALWAYS WANT TO PREFACE A CRITICISM WITH A KIND WORD
GQCo8slgt-0_2 0 AND SOMETIMES I EVEN SANDWICH THEM KIND WORD CRITICISM KIND WORD
GQCo8slgt-0_3 0 BUT IF YOU CAN FIND SOMETHING POSITIVE TO OFFSET THE CRITICISM THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THING
GQCo8slgt-0_4 0 I LIKE THE WAY THE VOICE WAS CARRYING ACROSS THE ROOM THAT WAS WONDERFUL
GQCo8slgt-0_5 0 WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE WAS THE WORD CHOICE
GQCo8slgt-0_6 0 ALRIGHT IF YOU CAN FIND THE POSITIVE AND OFFSET THE NEGATIVE THAT'S SO MUCH BETTER
GQCo8slgt-0_7 0 IN FACT FIND SOMETHING POSITIVE
GQCo8slgt-0_8 0 I LOVE YOUR SHIRT I LOVE THE WAY YOU'RE DRESSED I LOVE YOUR APPEARANCE
GQCo8slgt-0_9 0 BUT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT YOUR SPEECH OR WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT YOUR STYLE STRUCTURE IN YOUR WRITING OR WHATEVER IT IS
GQCo8slgt-0_10 0 FIND THE POSITIVE
HgIyAofDJm8_2 0 MY NAME IS LAUREN AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M HERE TO DISCUSS SHORT STRAIGHT HAIRSTYLES
HgIyAofDJm8_3 0 THE FIRST THING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS THE ACTUAL TOOLS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE WHEN BLOWING OUT YOUR HAIR
HgIyAofDJm8_4 0 OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED YOUR EVER TRUSTY BLOW DRYER
HgIyAofDJm8_5 0 THAT IS A GIVEN
HgIyAofDJm8_6 0 THEN YOU'RE GOING TO DECIDE WHAT BRUSH YOU WANT TO USE
HgIyAofDJm8_7 0 BRUSHES COME IN ALL DIFFERENT DIAMETERS AND SHAPES
HgIyAofDJm8_8 0 YOU CAN GET YOUR TRIANGULAR SHAPE AND ALSO YOUR ROUNDED
HgIyAofDJm8_9 0 IN ORDER TO GET YOUR HAIR STRAIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO CHOOSE A BRUSH THAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU
HgIyAofDJm8_10 0 WITH HEATHER'S HAIR SOMETHING LIKE THIS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE WAY TOO BIG BECAUSE HER HAIR IS SHORTER AND NOT LONG ENOUGH TO REALLY MANIPULATE
HgIyAofDJm8_11 0 WITH LONGER HAIR THIS COULD ACTUALLY WORKOUT NICELY
HgIyAofDJm8_12 0 HEATHER ALSO HAS A LOT OF LIGHTERS IN HER HAIR
HgIyAofDJm8_13 0 THERE ARE DIFFERENT PIECES SO IF YOU PULL HER HAIR OUT EACH PIECE HAS A BIT OF A DIFFERENT LENGTH
HgIyAofDJm8_14 0 THIS BOTTOM SECTION WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH HER GENERAL LENGTH IS THE LONGEST OF HER HAIR
HgIyAofDJm8_15 0 I WOULD SUGGEST USING A DIAMETER ABOUT THIS SIZE IN ORDER TO GO THROUGH THE HAIR IN THE BOTTOM
HgIyAofDJm8_16 0 IT WILL GIVE YOU A NICE FLIP UNDER OR A NICE FLIP OUT
HgIyAofDJm8_17 0 PLUS IT WILL BE EASY FOR YOU TO USE
HgIyAofDJm8_18 0 DUE TO HER LAYERS SHE WILL NEED TO USE A DIFFERENT SIZE A SMALLER SIZE DIAMETER ON THE TOP
HgIyAofDJm8_19 0 OTHERWISE IT JUST WON'T DO THE JOB AS WELL
HgIyAofDJm8_20 0 SHE'S GOING TO WANT TO CHOOSE SOMETHING THAT SHE'LL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GET TO ROLL HER HAIR WITH
HgIyAofDJm8_21 0 AT LEAST ONE AND A HALF TIMES
HgIyAofDJm8_22 0 SOMETHING THAT WILL WORK ON YOUR HAIR AND WILL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO TRANSFORM YOUR CURL
HgIyAofDJm8_23 0 IF YOUR BRUSH IS TOO BIG YOU WILL NOT GET THE CURL ON YOUR ENDS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
HbebO-Y6Cl8_1 0 ALRIGHT SO ONE OF THE WAYS TO GET INTO THE TORSO HOOPING IS TO LIFT UP TO THE NECK AND THEN DROP THE SHOULDERS IN
HbebO-Y6Cl8_2 0 FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS LIFT UP TO THE NECK
HbebO-Y6Cl8_3 0 AND HOOPING AROUND THE NECK CAN BE SOMEWHAT UNCOMFORTABLE SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE TO REALLY RELAX THE NECK AREA
HbebO-Y6Cl8_4 0 AND IF IT DOES START TO HURT LIFT IT BACK UP IN THE LASSO
HbebO-Y6Cl8_5 0 SO ONCE AGAIN DO THE LIFT UP INTO THE AIR
HbebO-Y6Cl8_6 0 NOW WHEN THE HOOP CROSSES INTO YOUR PALM YOU'RE GOING TO VERY GENTLY LAY THE HOOP DOWN ON YOUR LEFT SHOULDER HOOPING AROUND THE NECK
HbebO-Y6Cl8_7 0 IF THAT GETS UNCOMFORTABLE TAKE YOUR RIGHT HAND PLACE IT IN FRONT OF YOUR NECK AND LIFT IT BACK UP
HbebO-Y6Cl8_8 0 OKAY SO ONCE AGAIN UP HERE IN LASSO WHEN THE HOOP HITS THE PALM OF MY HAND I'M GOING TO BRING IT DOWN ONTO MY NECK SWINGING THE HOOP AROUND THE NECK
HbebO-Y6Cl8_9 0 IF IT GETS UNCOMFORTABLE I CAN TAKE THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT HAND AND LIFT THE HOOP UP
HbebO-Y6Cl8_10 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO DROP OUR SHOULDERS IN
HbebO-Y6Cl8_11 0 SO FROM UP HERE I'M GOING TO DROP THE HOOP DOWN TO MY NECK
HbebO-Y6Cl8_12 0 NOW JUST LIKE YOU WERE WHEN YOU WERE PUTTING YOUR HANDS IN THE HOOP YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK FOR THAT OPENING TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HOOP
HbebO-Y6Cl8_13 0 WHEN YOU SEE THAT OPENING I'M GOING TO LIFT MY LEFT SHOULDER UP AND IN LIKE THIS
HbebO-Y6Cl8_14 0 MY RIGHT SHOULDER WILL IMMEDIATELY DROP IN AS WELL
HbebO-Y6Cl8_15 0 TO GET IT BACK ON THE NECK DROP YOUR SHOULDERS DOWN
HbebO-Y6Cl8_16 0 ONCE AGAIN LEFT RIGHT AND THERE YOU ARE HOOPING ON THE TORSO
HbebO-Y6Cl8_17 0 TORSO HOOPING IS CHALLENGING
HbebO-Y6Cl8_18 0 SO MAKE SURE YOU'RE SHOWING THAT SKIN CONNECTING WITH THE HOOP
HbebO-Y6Cl8_19 0 ONCE YOU GET IT DOWN ONTO THE TORSO DON'T BE AFRAID TO TURN A BIT TO KEEP THAT HOOP GOING
HbebO-Y6Cl8_20 0 YOU CAN KIND OF BEND YOUR KNEES BRING IT BACK TO THE NECK LEFT RIGHT INTO THE TORSO
HbebO-Y6Cl8_21 0 NOTICE MY HANDS ARE CONNECTED TO THE THIGHS
GIe5C5GIxf0_1 0 ALRIGHT CONTINUING WITH LEARNING HOW TO JUGGLE SIDE SWAPS
GIe5C5GIxf0_2 0 WHEN YOU SEE A PATTERN A SIDE SWAP PATTERN THAT YOU CAN FOLLOW IT WILL JUST BE A STRING OF NUMBERS
GIe5C5GIxf0_3 0 NOW WHEN YOU JUGGLE A THREE BALL PATTERN THAT'S JUST THREE THREE THREE CONTINUING
GIe5C5GIxf0_4 0 SO EACH THROW IS A THREE BALL HEIGHT AND THEY JUST CROSS LIKE THIS
GIe5C5GIxf0_5 0 NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF COOLER PATTERNS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SIDE SWAP IS TO FIGURE OUT THE COOLER PATTERNS
GIe5C5GIxf0_6 0 WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT YOU NEED ALL OF THE THROW HEIGHTS TO AVERAGE OUT TO THE NUMBER OF BALLS YOU HAVE
GIe5C5GIxf0_7 0 SO WHEN I HAVE A THREE BALLS ALL THE THROWS WILL AVERAGE OUT TO THREE
GIe5C5GIxf0_8 0 SO IF I'M THROWING A THREE BALL PATTERN EACH THROW IS A THREE OF COURSE THE AVERAGE IS THREE
GIe5C5GIxf0_9 0 SOME OF THE OTHER COMMON PATTERNS ARE 441 WHICH SUMS UP TO NINE DIVIDED BY THREE THROWS IS AGAIN THREE
GIe5C5GIxf0_10 0 441 LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
GIe5C5GIxf0_11 0 THIS IS A VERY COMMON PATTERN PEOPLE LIKE IT A LOT
GIe5C5GIxf0_12 0 PEOPLE USE IT A LOT FOR DIFFERENT THREE BALL PATTERNS
GIe5C5GIxf0_13 0 WHEN YOU THROW A 441 WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO THINK ABOUT ARE TWO THROW GOING STRAIGHT UP THEN A HAND OFF
GIe5C5GIxf0_14 0 SO IF YOU START FROM A DEAD STILL TWO BALLS IN YOUR RIGHT HANDS IT WOULD BE THROW THROW HAND OFF
GIe5C5GIxf0_15 0 JUST LIKE THAT
GIe5C5GIxf0_16 0 THROW THROW PASS
GIe5C5GIxf0_17 0 YOU NEED TO LEARN THIS WITH BOTH HANDS JUST THAT AND MAKE SURE YOU PRACTICE THAT UNTIL BOTH THE VERTICAL THROWS ARE CLEAN
GIe5C5GIxf0_18 0 THEN YOU CAN INCORPORATE IT JUST LIKE THAT
HI77uab2CxQ_1 0 ALRIGHT THE DRINK WE ARE ABOUT TO MAKE IS CALLED THE CASA NOBLE MARGARITA
HI77uab2CxQ_2 0 THE FIRST THING WE'LL DO IS PUT SOME ICE IN A GLASS HERE AND WE ARE GOING TO MEASURE OUT ONE SHOT OF CASA NOBLE TEQUILA
HI77uab2CxQ_3 0 REPASADO IS THE IDEAL TEQUILA YOU WANT TO USE BUT THE FACT IS IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER AS FAR AS TASTE GOES
HI77uab2CxQ_4 0 WHICH ONE YOU USE BUT JUST SINCE THE NAME IS CASA NOBLE MARGARITA OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT TO TRY TO USE THAT IF YOU WANT TO BE AUTHENTIC
HI77uab2CxQ_5 0 SO ONE SHOT AND WE'LL ALSO DO A HALF OF A SHOT OF GRAN MARNIER THERE WE GO AND A HALF OF A SHOT OF LIME JUICE
HI77uab2CxQ_6 0 THERE WE GO
HI77uab2CxQ_7 0 FINALLY WE ARE GOING TO ADD SOME SOUR MIX OR MARGARITA MIX AND LET'S MIX THIS UP HERE
HI77uab2CxQ_8 0 JUST GO BACK AND FORTH YOU DON'T NEED TO SHAKE IT THERE WE GO
HI77uab2CxQ_9 0 GET A GLASS OBVIOUSLY IF YOU HAVE A MARGARITA GLASS YOU CAN SALT THE RIM YOU CAN DO THAT OR YOU CAN JUST SERVE IT UP IN ANY KIND OF GLASS YOU HAVE AVAILABLE
HI77uab2CxQ_10 0 THERE'S THAT GIVE IT A STRAW AND GARNISH WITH A LIME IF YOU'D LIKE
G5lqG2VO4jI_1 0 I'M JUDY FRANCK FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING SOME NAIL ART TODAY
G5lqG2VO4jI_2 0 OK NOW THE HARDEST PART IS PICKING YOUR COLORS
G5lqG2VO4jI_3 0 IT'S REALLY UP TO YOU IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
G5lqG2VO4jI_4 0 YOU CAN'T REALLY MAKE A MISTAKE
G5lqG2VO4jI_5 0 YOU JUST WANT TO GET LOTS OF LAYERS BUT WHEN I THINK OF A SUNSET WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY WHICH IS A SUNSET BEACH SCENE I LIKE TO HAVE A VARIETY OF COLORS SO IT LOOKS LIKE A SUN GOING DOWN
G5lqG2VO4jI_6 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO START OFF PICKING COLORS THAT LOOK LIKE THE SUN IS SETTING
G5lqG2VO4jI_7 0 SO WHAT I'LL DO I'LL TAKE A LITTLE PAINT A LITTLE PINK PAINT AND I'M JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND GET THAT GOING REAL QUICKLY UP AND AROUND HER CUTICLES IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER THAT IT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT GETS UP THERE CLOSE TO THE CUTICLE AND STARTS THE LAYERING PROCESS
G5lqG2VO4jI_8 0 NOW THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS I'M GETTING SOME OF THOSE LITTLE BLOBBIES IN MY PAINT THAT HAPPENS ONCE IN A WHILE I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT CLEAN YOUR BRUSH AND START OVER GRAB ANOTHER LITTLE SPECK OF PAINT AND WE'LL KEEP GOING
G5lqG2VO4jI_9 0 AND IF YOU SEE ANY LITTLE BLOBS YOU CAN GET THEM OUT RIGHT AWAY WITH YOUR BRUSH JUST KEEP MOVING IT AROUND WITH YOUR BRUSH UNTIL YOU GET IT OUT
G5lqG2VO4jI_10 0 SOMETIMES THERE'S A LITTLE PIECE OF HARDENED PIGMENT IN THE PAINT BOTTLE ITSELF THAT COMES OUT IT MIGHT JUST BE THAT THE PAINT'S OLD
G5lqG2VO4jI_11 0 IT'S HARD TO TELL
G5lqG2VO4jI_12 0 I DIDN'T SEE TOO MUCH OF THIS BEFORE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE I'VE BEEN GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF THAT LATELY
G5lqG2VO4jI_13 0 I JUST KNOCK THEM OFF AND BRUSH IT OFF ON MY PAPER TOWEL
G5lqG2VO4jI_14 0 IT'S NOT A PROBLEM AND JUST KEEP GOING
G5lqG2VO4jI_15 0 THE ONLY TIME THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM IS IF YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING REAL DETAILED SAY A FACE OR SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT THOSE LITTLE BLOBS TO END UP ON THERE THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE HARD TO GET OFF WITH THAT KIND OF DETAIL
G5lqG2VO4jI_16 0 SO WE'VE GOT OUR BASE COAT DOWN AND NOW YOU START THINKING OF DIFFERENT COLORS THAT YOU CAN LAYER UP WITH
G5lqG2VO4jI_17 0 SO I'M MIXING A LITTLE BIT OF THIS RED AND YELLOW TOGETHER TO TRY TO GET SOME SUNSET COLORS
G5lqG2VO4jI_18 0 AND I'M JUST GOING TO START SLAPPING IT ON THERE JUST REAL QUICKLY
G5lqG2VO4jI_19 0 AND IF HER FINGERS ARE A LITTLE STIFF YOU JUST MOVE THEM AND IT WILL GET THEM LOOSENED UP AGAIN
G5lqG2VO4jI_20 0 BUT IF YOU PICTURE A SUNSET YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KEEP GOING DOWN WITH YOUR COLORS SO IT LOOKS MORE AUTHENTIC BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING THESE OUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE ALL THOSE LITTLE DETAILS LIKE THE PINK BEHIND IT THERE'S NO STRIPES
G5lqG2VO4jI_21 0 IT'S GOING TO HAVE CLOUDS IN FRONT OF IT
G5lqG2VO4jI_22 0 WE ALWAYS PUT LAYERS OF THINGS SO THAT'S GOING TO HELP COVER SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW
h8IETmtfjO0_1 0 AFTER YOUR CHILD HAS BEEN MASTERING BLENDS FOR A WHILE MAYBE A COUPLE OF WEEKS MAYBE A LITTLE MORE WHATEVER YOU THINK AND THAT YOU'VE MADE THEM SOME NICE BOOKS AND WORKSHEETS USING BLENDS AND END BLENDS TWO IN THE BEGINNING TWO IN THE END WE'RE GOING TO START HAVING DOUBLE BLENDS AND TRIPLE BLENDS
h8IETmtfjO0_2 0 NOW DOUBLE BLENDS ARE WHEN YOU HAVE A BLEND IN THE BEGINNING AND THE END TWO CONSONANTS TWO CONSONANTS AND JUST ONE VOWEL IN THE MIDDLE
h8IETmtfjO0_3 0 SO AN EXAMPLE AND WE'LL MAKE A SEPARATE PAGE FOR THEM
h8IETmtfjO0_4 0 AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE BLAND STING FLING PLEND NOTICE I THREW IN THERE WHAT IS THAT
h8IETmtfjO0_5 0 A NONSENSE WORD IT'S NOT A REAL WORD BUT IT WILL HELP THEM PRACTICE THE PHONICS AND THE SOUNDING OUT SKILLS AND IT'S GOOD
h8IETmtfjO0_6 0 IF THEY SOUND IT OUT CORRECTLY AND DON'T TRY TO GUESS THAT IT IS A REAL WORD THEN YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE REALLY ISOLATING THEIR SKILLS
h8IETmtfjO0_7 0 SPEND AND YOU CAN COME UP WITH AS MANY MORE AS YOU CAN THINK OF
h8IETmtfjO0_8 0 AND TRIPLE BLENDS
h8IETmtfjO0_9 0 NOW DON'T JUMP RIGHT TO TRIPLE BLENDS MASTER DOUBLE BLENDS FOR A FEW DAYS OR WEEKS WHATEVER YOU THINK UNTIL YOU THINK THEY'RE READY AND THEY'RE JUST TIRED OF BLENDS
h8IETmtfjO0_10 0 TRIPLE BLENDS ARE THREE IN THE BEGINNING
h8IETmtfjO0_11 0 STR SPL SKL SPR AND HAVE THEM JUST SAY THOSE AND TRY NOT TO PUT THE VOWEL ON THE END LIKE I DID
h8IETmtfjO0_12 0 STR SPL SKL SPR IT'S KIND OF HARD
h8IETmtfjO0_13 0 AND THEN YOU CAN START STRAP SOUNDING THOSE OUT SPLAT STRIP SKLOT NOTICE THAT IS A NONSENSE WORD
h8IETmtfjO0_14 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO CIRCLE IT I JUST DID FOR FUN AND SPRUNG
h8IETmtfjO0_15 0 NOW LOOK AT THIS I HAVE THREE IN THE BEGINNING TWO ON THE END
h8IETmtfjO0_16 0 THAT'S FIVE LETTERS THAT MAKE UP A BLEND YOU CAN START ADDING MORE AND MORE AT THIS POINT BECAUSE YOUR CHILD WILL BE VERY GOOD AT IT
h8IETmtfjO0_17 0 STRAND IS ANOTHER ONE AND KEEP GOING LIKE THAT AS MANY AS YOU CAN THINK OF

g8bWKxCobxY_1 0 ALRIGHT NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO WITH YOUR VOICE
g8bWKxCobxY_2 0 THE FIRST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE VOICES OF THE CHARACTERS
g8bWKxCobxY_3 0 NOW YOUR PIECE MAY HAVE ONE OR TWO CHARACTERS IT MAY HAVE FIFTEEN CHARACTERS
g8bWKxCobxY_4 0 DON'T FOCUS ON CREATING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT VOICES AND ACCENTS FOR YOUR CHARACTERS
g8bWKxCobxY_5 0 THAT'S NOT NECESSARY
g8bWKxCobxY_6 0 WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR FIRST OF ALL IS SIMPLY VOLUME CAN WE HEAR YOU
g8bWKxCobxY_7 0 AND ARTICULATION CAN WE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
g8bWKxCobxY_8 0 BUT THEN WHAT ARE THE SUBTLE DIFFERENCES THAT YOU CAN ASSIGN TO EACH OF YOUR CHARACTER VOICES SO THAT WE THE AUDIENCE CAN TELL THEM APART
g8bWKxCobxY_9 0 PERHAPS ONE OF THEM TALKS IN A LOWER VOICE MAYBE ONE OF THEM TALKS A LITTLE FASTER
g8bWKxCobxY_10 0 DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT DEVELOPING THESE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT CHARACTERS BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THE NARRATION VOICE THAT'S GOING TO SAY SAID JIMSAID SALLY SAID ERNEST DEFIANTLY SO THE AUDIENCE WILL ALWAYS KNOW WHO SAID IT BECAUSE OF THE NARRATOR BUT IT HELPS TO HAVE SLIGHT DISTINCTIONS SLIGHT VOCAL CHANGES AMONG YOUR CHARACTERS
g8bWKxCobxY_11 0 NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NARRATOR
Gr-7Y16Eqm8_1 0 ALRIGHT SO HERE WE ARE WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR THE RESIN TO CURE
Gr-7Y16Eqm8_2 0 AND LIKE I SAID THIS UV-RESIN THIS IS ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES LATER AND YOU CAN ALREADY SEE THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN PUT A NAIL MARK IN THERE WHICH MEANS THAT THE RESIN IS DOING EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD BE DOING WHICH IS JUST CURING AND THE UV WILL ACCELERATE THAT PROCESS
Gr-7Y16Eqm8_3 0 RESIN'S A FUNNY MATERIAL IT ALWAYS CURES FOREVER SO IT NEVER STOPS CURING
Gr-7Y16Eqm8_4 0 AND WHAT WE'RE DOING REALLY WITH THE HOT COAT IS SEALING IN THOSE FUMES
Gr-7Y16Eqm8_5 0 SO REALLY OLD SURFBOARDS THEY GET BRITTLE IN TIME AND THE REASON WHY THEY GET BRITTLE IS BECAUSE THAT FIBERGLASS AND RESIN CONTINUES TO CURE
Gr-7Y16Eqm8_6 0 SO THIS IS ONE OF THE REAL GOOD CHANGES THAT'S OCCURRED IN THE FIBERGLASS AND RESIN FIELD ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT THEY'RE CLEANING A LOT OF THE PRODUCTS UP AND THEY'RE NOT THAT HARMFUL
g6IPyRwPX20_1 0 HI I'M JABARI PRIDE AND YOU ARE BACK TO EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
g6IPyRwPX20_2 0 WE JUST DID PLOWS AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO DO THE HURDLE STRETCH
g6IPyRwPX20_3 0 OKAY THE HURDLE STRETCH IS REALLY GOOD FOR YOUR HAMSTRINGS AND IF YOU DO IT ANOTHER VARIATION OF THAT THAT IS GOOD FOR YOUR LOWER BACK AS WELL
g6IPyRwPX20_4 0 SO THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS REMEMBER NINETY DEGREES NINETY DEGREE
g6IPyRwPX20_5 0 SO YOU WANT A NINETY DEGREE AT YOUR ANKLE ON YOUR LEFT FOOT TO START STRETCHING SO WE CAN START STRETCHING OUR LEFT HAMSTRING
g6IPyRwPX20_6 0 YOU BRING YOUR RIGHT LEG BACK YOU WANT ANOTHER NINETY DEGREE ANGLE RIGHT HERE BETWEEN YOUR TWO THIGHS
g6IPyRwPX20_7 0 YOU WANT TO COME BACK AND BRING ANOTHER 3RD NINETY DEGREE
g6IPyRwPX20_8 0 SO YOU HAVE YOUR ONE YOUR TWO YOUR 3RD NINETY DEGREE ANGLE IS GOING TO BE ON YOUR OPPOSITE LEG AND THEN YOUR 4TH NINETY IS GOING TO BE ON YOUR OTHER ANKLE
g6IPyRwPX20_9 0 NOW IF YOU HAVE REALLY REALLY BAD FLEXIBILITY AND YOU CAN NOT GET ALL FOUR 90S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS BRING YOUR LEG THAT IS BACK
g6IPyRwPX20_10 0 BRING THAT ANKLE UP TOWARDS YOUR BUTT THAT IS GOING TO TAKE SOME OF THE STRESS OFF THE KNEE
g6IPyRwPX20_11 0 THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO ACTUALLY LEAN FORWARD AND REACH FOR YOUR TOE WITH YOUR HAND THAT IS ON THE SAME SIDE
g6IPyRwPX20_12 0 SO AS YOU ARE REACHING FORWARD YOU ARE GOING TO FEEL THAT STRETCH IN YOUR HAMSTRING
g6IPyRwPX20_13 0 NOW WHEN YOU ARE DOING THE STRETCH YOU DON'T WANT TO BOUNCE YOUR SELF YOU KNOW FORWARD CAUSE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS IT IS REALLY GOING TO UP YOUR CHANCES OF PULLING YOUR HAMSTRING AND YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT
g6IPyRwPX20_14 0 SO YOU JUST START UP STRAIGHT NICE AND TALL AND JUST START REACHING
g6IPyRwPX20_15 0 UNTIL IT HURTS OR UNTIL IT IS AT A LEVEL OF THAT YOU CAN WITHSTAND
g6IPyRwPX20_16 0 ONCE TO YOU GET TO THAT POINT YOU'LL STOP AND YOU HOLD IT FOR THIRTY SECONDS EASE OFF OF IT AND GO BACK AGAIN AND STRETCH UNTIL YOU GET TO THAT POINT WHERE YOU CAN WITHSTAND THE PAIN THAT IS IN YOUR HAMSTRING AS YOU ARE STRETCHING IT
g6IPyRwPX20_17 0 THAT IS A HURDLE STRETCH
h1rlwq9Itwc_1 0 THE MARINE ORGANISM WE ARE GOING TO IDENTIFY NOW IS THE CLEANING GOBY
h1rlwq9Itwc_2 0 ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CLEANING FISH ONE WILL FIND ON A CORAL REEF IN THE CARIBBEAN IS THE CLEANING GOBY
h1rlwq9Itwc_3 0 BUT THE GLEANING GOBY HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED IN THE WATERS AROUND FLORIDA
h1rlwq9Itwc_4 0 IT IS A SMALL FISH ONLY ABOUT AN INCH TO AN INCH AND THREE QUARTERS IN LENGTH
h1rlwq9Itwc_5 0 IT IS A LONG CIGAR SHAPE FISH
h1rlwq9Itwc_6 0 SO ITS MAXIMUM BIRTH IS NO MORE THAN A QUARTER OF AN INCH IN MOST SPECIMENS
h1rlwq9Itwc_7 0 CLEANING GOBIES ARE HARD TO DIFFERENTIATE FROM A SIMILARLY COLORED AND SIMILARLY SIZED SHARK NOSE GOBY
h1rlwq9Itwc_8 0 BOTH FISH HAVE A BRIGHT YELLOW V ON THEIR NOSE ALTHOUGH THE SHARK NOSE CAN HAVE A WHITE V
h1rlwq9Itwc_9 0 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THAT THE CLEANING GOBY'S YELLOW V FADES IN TO A PALE STRIPE AS IT PROGRESSES TOWARDS THE TAIL
h1rlwq9Itwc_10 0 WHEREAS THE SHARK NOSE HAS THE V CONTINUE TO THE TAIL EITHER AS A CONTINUATION OF THE YELLOW COLOR OR AS A BRIGHT BLUE STRIPE
h1rlwq9Itwc_11 0 A SHARK NOSE GOBY WITH A WHITE V ON ITS NOSE WILL HAVE THE WHITE COLOR CONTINUE AS A WHITE STRIPE TO THE TAIL
h1rlwq9Itwc_12 0 THE REST OF THE CLEANING GOBY IS BLACK OVER MOST OF ITS BODY ALTHOUGH THE BELLY IS LIGHT COLORED WHITE OR WHITISH BLUE
h1rlwq9Itwc_13 0 CLEANING GOBIES ARE USUALLY FOUND RESTING ON THE TOP OF CORAL HEADS AND USUALLY IN SMALL GROUPS
h1rlwq9Itwc_14 0 THESES CONGREGATIONS OF CLEANING GOBIES FORM THE CLEANING STATIONS THAT ARE VISITED BY OTHER LARGER FISH
h1rlwq9Itwc_15 0 WHEN A LARGER FISH APPROACHES IT WILL HOVER OVER THE CLEANING STATION AND THE CLEANING GOBIES GO TO WORK BY WORKING THEIR WAY ACROSS THE VISITOR'S BODY EATING THE ACTIVE PARASITES THAT ACCUMULATE ON THE BODY OF THESE FISHES
h1rlwq9Itwc_16 0 THESE ACTIVE PARASITES PROBABLY MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF THE CLEANING GOBIES DIET
h1rlwq9Itwc_17 0 ONE THING I LIKE TO DO WHEN I FIND ONE OF THE CLEANING GOBY CLEANING STATIONS IS TO SLOWLY EXTEND MY HAND TO THE AREA JUST ABOVE THE LIVING CORAL WHERE THE CLEANING GOBIES RESIDE AND HOLD IT STATIONERY FOR A MINUTE OR SO
h1rlwq9Itwc_18 0 MOST OF THE TIME THE CLEANING GOBIES WILL SWIM TO MY HAND AND START TO SWIM OVER IT CLEANING AWAY DEAD SKIN AND ANY OTHER THINGS THEY FIND THAT THEY THINK SHOULDN'T BE THERE
h1rlwq9Itwc_19 0 IT IS A FUNNY FEELING WHEN THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY ARE SO SMALL AND LIKE IT KIND OF TICKLES AS THEY MOVE ACROSS YOUR HAND BETWEEN YOUR FINGERS AND STOP TO TUCK AT SOME LITTLE BIT OF LOOSE SKIN
h1rlwq9Itwc_20 0 CLEANING GOBIES ARE A MONOGAMOUS FISH MEANING THEY MATE WITH THE SAME FISH REGULARLY
h1rlwq9Itwc_21 0 EGGS ARE LAID ON THE SUB STRAIGHT USUALLY ON A LEDGE AND THE MALE GENERALLY GUARDS THE EGG MASS
h1rlwq9Itwc_22 0 EGGS HATCHED IN A FEW DAYS AND THE FRY DRIFT WITH THE CURRENT UNTIL THEY ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO TAKE UP RESIDENCE ON THEIR OWN CORAL HEAD
h1rlwq9Itwc_23 0 I HAVE SEEN SOME CLEANING STATIONS WITH SIX OR EIGHT CLEANING GOBIES ON IT OF VARIOUS SIZES AND I OFTEN WONDERED IF IT WAS A FAMILY BUSINESS
h1rlwq9Itwc_24 0 I'LL NEVER KNOW FOR CERTAIN
h1rlwq9Itwc_25 0 THAT'S THE CLEANING GOBY
h1OOkM0fNHI_1 0 HI MY NAME IS CHELL GARCIA-TRIAS AND I'M A MODERN DANCE INSTRUCTOR IN AUSTIN TEXAS
h1OOkM0fNHI_2 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A WAY TO STRETCH OUT THE SIDES OF YOUR NECK THE WAY WE WOULD DO IT IN MODERN DANCE
h1OOkM0fNHI_3 0 SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO FIRST I'M GOING TO PLANT MY FEET IN THE GROUND AND THEN I'M GOING TO REACH MY SHOULDERS DOWN I'M GOING TO REACH OUT WITH MY HAND I'M GOING TO REACH DOWN WITH MY RIGHT HAND AND OUT
h1OOkM0fNHI_4 0 ALL THE WAY UP DROPPING MY SHOULDER UNTIL I GET TO MY EAR AND THEN I'M GOING TO GENTLY REST MY HEAD ON MY SHOULDER THERE AND JUST GIVE A LITTLE TUG ON MY EAR TOWARDS THE GROUND
h1OOkM0fNHI_5 0 AND THEN WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS REACH OUT WITH THAT OPPOSITE ARM AT AN ANGLE
h1OOkM0fNHI_6 0 YOU'LL FEEL WHEN YOU START TO REACH OUT AT AN ANGLE THAT YOU'RE REALLY INTENSIFYING THE STRETCH IN THIS PART OF YOUR NECK RIGHT HERE
h1OOkM0fNHI_7 0 WHILE I'M HERE I'M GOING TO TAKE SOME DEEP BREATHS AND JUST RELAX TRYING TO RELEASE THE MUSCLES IN MY NECK
h1OOkM0fNHI_8 0 I'M NOT TRYING TO PULL THEM APART I'M JUST TRYING TO RELEASE THEM
h1OOkM0fNHI_9 0 AND WHEN I'M DONE WITH THAT SIDE I'LL STAY THERE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES BUT WHEN I'M DONE I'LL LET GO RELEASE MY HEAD UP MY ARM OUT AND AROUND COMING BACK DOWN
h1OOkM0fNHI_10 0 AND THEN I'LL REACH UP AND AROUND WITH MY OTHER ARM TO MY OTHER EAR TO DROPPING MY HEAD
h1OOkM0fNHI_11 0 I'M USING THE WEIGHT OF MY ARM TO PULL MY HEAD DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND I'M GOING TO REACH OUT AT AN ANGLE WITH THAT OTHER ARM
h1OOkM0fNHI_12 0 AND I FEEL THAT DEEP INTENSE STRETCH IN MY NECK AGAIN
h1OOkM0fNHI_13 0 IT'S A GREAT WAY TO RELEASE ANY KIND OF TENSION YOU MIGHT BE FEELING IN YOUR NECK
h1OOkM0fNHI_14 0 TAKE SOME DEEP BREATHS AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE YOU'LL RELEASE THE RIGHT ARM RELEASE THE LEFT ARM RELEASE THE HEAD AND JUST RELAX AND YOU SHOULD FEEL LIKE YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT TALLER
h1OOkM0fNHI_15 0 IT'S A GREAT WAY TO STRETCH OUT YOUR NECK AND THE SIDES OF YOUR NECK IN MODERN DANCE
_G_5p3C9Qk4_1 0 HI I'M THIS IS JOHN STEWART AND THIS IS HOW TO PUT OUT A FIRE FOR WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH IT
_G_5p3C9Qk4_2 0 ONCE YOU'VE BUILT YOUR FIRE BURN IT AND LET IT DO IT'S THING YOU NEED TO PUT IT OUT PROPERLY
_G_5p3C9Qk4_3 0 YOU CAN'T JUST POUR A BUNCH OF WATER ON IT AND EXPECT IT TO BE OUT
_G_5p3C9Qk4_4 0 YOU DO NEED TO HAVE WATER BY THIS IS VERY EASY WAY TO PUT IT OUT
_G_5p3C9Qk4_5 0 JUST HAVE SOME WATER NEARBY POUR A LITTLE BIT ON TAKE A RAKE OR A SHOVEL AND STIR THE COALS AROUND IN THE WATER MAKE IT REAL REAL SOUPY
_G_5p3C9Qk4_6 0 THIS IS SO THAT YOU UNCOVER COALS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN STUCK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FIRE
_G_5p3C9Qk4_7 0 YOU WANT TO STIR IT UP PUT A LITTLE MORE WATER ON IT AND YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE AND RUN YOUR HAND ACROSS THE TOP OF THE FIRE TO MAKE SURE ALL THE COALS HAVE COOLED OFF
_G_5p3C9Qk4_8 0 ANOTHER WAY OF DOING THIS IS BY TAKING AND HAVING YOUR NATURAL PIT DUG OUT
_G_5p3C9Qk4_9 0 YOU CAN TAKE PUT SOME WATER IN IT AND THEN BURY YOUR COALS ONCE THEY'VE COOLED OFF
_G_5p3C9Qk4_10 0 BURYING THEM ALSO HELPS WITH THE LEAVE NOT TRACE YOU BURY YOUR COALS WHERE THERE IS NOT A VISUAL AREA FROM WHERE YOU'VE BURNT SOMETHING
_G_5p3C9Qk4_11 0 THIS IS REALLY GOOD FOR LEAVE NO TRACE SO THAT OTHERS THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT IS JUST LEFT ALONE
_G_5p3C9Qk4_12 0 BUT THE EASIEST WAY TO PUT YOUR FIRE OUT IS TO HAVE SOME WATER
_G_5p3C9Qk4_13 0 IF YOU DO HAVE A FIRE ESCAPE POUR AS MUCH WATER HAVE AS MUCH NEARBY TO WHERE YOU CAN PUT THE FIRE OUT VERY EASILY
_G_5p3C9Qk4_14 0 THIS IS WAYS TO PUT OUT YOUR FIRE
Gq5QF28o7TQ_1 0 NOW LET'S PRACTICE WITH THAT E-FLAT A LITTLE BIT
Gq5QF28o7TQ_2 0 PLAYING THE SAME TYPE OF PATTERN THAT WE PLAYED BEFORE
Gq5QF28o7TQ_3 0 THE ROOT THE FIFTH THE OCTAVE THE FIFTH AND THE ROOT AGAIN
Gq5QF28o7TQ_4 0 WE'LL PLAY THESE TWO WAYS
Gq5QF28o7TQ_5 0 WE'LL START ON THE D STRING THEN GO TO THE G STRING FOR B-FLAT AND JUMP UP FOR THAT E-FLAT WITH YOUR SECOND FINGER
Gq5QF28o7TQ_6 0 YOU CAN ALSO PLAY IT STARTING WITH YOUR LOW E-FLAT HERE
Gq5QF28o7TQ_7 0 NOW JUMP UP ON THE D STRING AND YOU'RE GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY UP AND FIND THAT B-FLAT NOTE
Gq5QF28o7TQ_8 0 THEN JUST GO OVER ONE FOR YOUR HIGH E-FLAT
Gq5QF28o7TQ_9 0 YOU COULD ALSO FIND E-FLAT ON YOUR A STRING BY COUNTING UP A B C D THERE'S YOUR E-FLAT
Gq5QF28o7TQ_10 0 AND IF YOU KEEP YOUR HAND IN THAT SHAPE YOU'LL NOTICE IF YOU REMEMBER OUR EARLIER LESSON ON RELATIVE NOTES AND PATTERNS FOR FINDING THE FIFTH IN OCTAVE
Gq5QF28o7TQ_11 0 YOU HAVE E-FLAT B-FLAT HIGH E-FLAT
Gq5QF28o7TQ_12 0 GOING OVER TO THE E STRING YOU HAVE B-FLAT F AND HIGH B-FLAT
Gq5QF28o7TQ_13 0 SO THERE'S SOME TARGET POSITIONS
Gq5QF28o7TQ_14 0 YOU SEE THOSE HIGHER NOTES ARE JUST PAST WHERE YOUR THUMB IS GOING TO HIT THE BODY IF YOU HAVE A BASS LIKE THIS
Gq5QF28o7TQ_15 0 WITH YOUR BASS IT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER OR LOWER POSITION DEPENDING ON HOW IT'S SET UP
gGFIyFhfqgA_1 0 NEXT WHAT WERE GONNA DO IS DO A LITTLE TOP SEWING ON THE TOP OF THE COIN PURSE SO THIS IS WHAT WAS DONE BEFORE I DONE MADE LITTLE OPENING SEWN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LINING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ZIPPER
gGFIyFhfqgA_2 0 I'M JUST GONNA WIPE IT OUT WHICH MEANS BRING IT ALL THE RIGHT SIDE OUT
gGFIyFhfqgA_3 0 THIS IS WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IS MAKE THESE TOP SEAMS AND ON THE TOP AND INSTEAD OF GOING ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE TOP OF OUR OPENING I'M JUST GONNA TACK IT JUST LIKE I DID ON THE INSIDE
gGFIyFhfqgA_4 0 LET ME DO THAT RIGHT QUICK
gGFIyFhfqgA_5 0 SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS PULL THIS APART YOU DON'T WANT TO PATCH THE LINING IN THERE AND SEW IT ALL TOGETHER YOU WANT TO OPEN THAT UP
gGFIyFhfqgA_6 0 HAVE THE LINING PULLED OUT ON ONE SIDE AND THE FABRIC IS A LITTLE AWAY FROM THE ZIPPER SO JUST MOVE IT OVER RIGHT TO THE EDGE
gGFIyFhfqgA_7 0 RIGHT TO THE EDGE OF WHERE THE ZIPPER IS
gGFIyFhfqgA_8 0 AND RUN A NICE CLEAN TOP SEAM ALL THE WAY ACROSS THIS
gGFIyFhfqgA_9 0 BACK TACK ALSO YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BACK TACK ALL YOUR SEAMS
gGFIyFhfqgA_10 0 IF YOU DON'T YOUR JUST GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK AND RESET THE LITTLE AREA
gGFIyFhfqgA_11 0 WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO BACK AND DO THINGS
gGFIyFhfqgA_12 0 THATS ONE SIDE I'M GONNA GO BACK AND DO THE OTHER SIDE
gGFIyFhfqgA_13 0 AND THIS SIDE IS THE ONE WITH THE HOLE
gGFIyFhfqgA_14 0 SO WHEN YOUR SEWING MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHICH SIDES THE HOLE CAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT IF YOU SEW THAT ONE CLOSED
gGFIyFhfqgA_15 0 AND I'M JUST GONNA MOVE IT OVER JUST LIKE I DID THE OTHER ONE
gGFIyFhfqgA_16 0 MAKE SURE THE LININGS OUT
gGFIyFhfqgA_18 0 NOW I'M JUST GONNA GO
gGFIyFhfqgA_19 0 I'M GONNA FEEL WERE I STOP
gGFIyFhfqgA_20 0 BACK TACK THE THREADS
gGFIyFhfqgA_21 0 I'M GONNA GO TO THE OTHER SIDE I'M GONNA BE SEWING ON THE OTHER SIDE AND I THINK YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT
gGFIyFhfqgA_22 0 NOW THIS IS WHERE MY SEAM STOPS RIGHT THERE
gGFIyFhfqgA_23 0 MOVE MY FABRIC OVER ONE LITTLE TOP STITCH RIGHT HERE
gGFIyFhfqgA_24 0 SINCE WERE DONE THAT NOW WERE GOING TO BE READY TO PUT THE ZIPPER HERE
gGFIyFhfqgA_25 0 I THINK YOU CAN DO THAT NEXT
gdpzjepU4AM_1 0 NOW INSERT BYPASS BASICALLY ALLOWS YOU TO BYPASS ANY INSERT BY CLICKING THIS EDIT BYPASS BUTTON
gdpzjepU4AM_2 0 THIS BASICALLY ALLOWS YOU TO CLICK ON ANY TYPE OF EFFECT WHATEVER AND ALLOWS YOU TO BYPASS JUST WITH A CLICK OF THAT BUTTON
gdpzjepU4AM_3 0 WHEN I LOOK AT RIGHT HERE I COULD LOOK AT MY MY COMPRESSOR AT THE TOP AS I PRESS THE BUTTON YOU CAN SEE THAT THE BYPASS TURNS ON AND OFF
gdpzjepU4AM_4 0 SO NOT ONLY CAN I AFFECT THE DIFFERENT PARAMETERS WITHIN THE PLUG-IN I CAN ALSO BYPASS ANY PLUG-IN FROM MY BOARD JUST FROM THERE YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING
gdpzjepU4AM_5 0 I COULD ALSO TAKE DIFFERENT I COULD ADD PLUG-INS REMOVE PLUG-INS AND SIDE CHAIN DIFFERENT PLUG-INS DEPENDING ON WHERE I'M AT
gdpzjepU4AM_6 0 WHEN DOING THESE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TO PRESS THIS EDIT BYPASS BUTTON BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE
gdpzjepU4AM_7 0 IF YOU WANT TO AFFECT THE DIFFERENT PARAMETERS AND CHANGE THE DIFFERENT SETTINGS WITHIN THE PLUG-IN YOU JUST HAVE TO CLICK ON THE PLUG-IN BUTTON WITHIN THIS CONTROL PANEL BUT WHEN YOU WANT TO BYPASS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HIT THE EDIT BYPASS BUTTON FIRST
glvh6JlK7hc_1 0 OKAY YOU'VE CLEANED YOUR RECORD YOU'VE DRIED YOUR RECORD YOUR RECORD'S DOING GOOD YOU'VE GOT TO PUT IT AWAY NOW
glvh6JlK7hc_2 0 BUT YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE NOT ONLY THAT YOU DON'T DAMAGE YOUR RECORD WHILE YOU'RE PUTTING IT AWAY BUT YOU'RE PUTTING IT SOMEWHERE WHERE IT'S GOING TO STAY CLEAN
glvh6JlK7hc_3 0 SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR SLEEVE THERE COULD HAVE BEEN DIRT THAT WAS ON YOUR RECORD IN THE FIRST PLACE I WOULD SAY TURN IT SO THAT YOU'VE GOT THE OPENING AND IT'S PROBABLY STILL ON THIS INSIDE SLEEVE
glvh6JlK7hc_4 0 SO IF YOU DECIDE TO STILL USE THIS SLEEVE YOU THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAN YOU MIGHT WANT TO BLOW IT OUT
glvh6JlK7hc_5 0 BUT I CAN SEE IN THERE IT'S NOT THAT CLEAN
glvh6JlK7hc_6 0 SO I'M GOING TO PUT THE RECORD DOWN FOR A MOMENT ON THIS TURNTABLE I KNOW THE SLIP MATS ARE CLEAN PULL THIS OUT I'M GOING TO GET A BRAND NEW ONE
glvh6JlK7hc_7 0 I ALWAYS KEEP NEW SLEEVES ON HAND
glvh6JlK7hc_8 0 SO I FIND MY OPENING PICK UP MY RECORD SLIDE IT INTO MY SLEEVE I HAVE NEVER TOUCHED THE INSIDE OF THE RECORD AND THEN SLIDE THE SLEEVE INSIDE OF THE COVER
glvh6JlK7hc_9 0 I'M GOING TO SLIDE IT IN SO THAT THE RECORD CANNOT FALL OUT AND HAS NO CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE
glvh6JlK7hc_10 0 I'M GOING TO SLIDE IT IN SIDEWAYS AND I'LL GET INTO WHY I'M DOING THAT IN THE NEXT SEGMENT
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_1 0 NEXT TRICK I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU TODAY IS CALLED THE WRIST WHIP
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_2 0 THIS IS A COOL TRICK IT'S ACTUALLY SIMILAR TO PLASTIC WHIP
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_3 0 IF YOU DIDN'T LEARN PLASTIC WHIP ALL READY IT'S THE ONE WHERE IT COMES OVER YOUR THUMB
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_4 0 GO TAKE A LOOK AT THE VIDEO
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_5 0 LEARN THE MOTION OF THAT BECAUSE IT MIGHT HELP YOU OUT
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_6 0 WRIST WHIP IS SIMILAR MOTION EXCEPT IT'S DONE SIDEWAYS IT'S DONE FROM BREAK AWAY IT LOOKS LIKE THAT
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_7 0 WHAT'S COOL WITH THIS TRICK IS YOU CAN ACTUALLY MODIFY IT BY SWINGING THE STRING AROUND MORE AND THEN WHIPPING THE YOYO LIKE THAT
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_8 0 LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE SO THIS IS ONE
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_9 0 YOU CAN GO AROUND TWICE AND HIT IT
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_10 0 AND WE'LL SEE IF I CAN DO THIS
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_11 0 SOMETIMES WITH A LITTLE PRACTICE YOU CAN HIT THREE AROUND LIKE THAT
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_12 0 THAT'S A TRIPLE WRIST WHIP
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_13 0 IT'S A GREAT TRICK ON STAGE IT LOOKS REALLY FLASHY REALLY IMPRESSIVE IF YOU JUST HIT IT AND GO INTO ANOTHER TRICK
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_14 0 SO LET ME TEACH YOU THE BASICS
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_15 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS THROW A STRONG BREAK AWAY AS I MENTIONED
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_16 0 LET THE YOYO SWING DOWN TO THE BOTTOM LIKE THAT
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_17 0 YOU TAKE YOUR THROW HAND AND HOLD IT STRAIGHT OUT LIKE SO
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_18 0 WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO PUSH IT TO THE RIGHT AND YOU'LL NOTICE YOU POP THE YOYO UP AND PUSH IT TO THE RIGHT IN THE SAME MOTION
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_19 0 IT'S KIND OF LIKE HOW WE DID THE SIDE WINDER
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_20 0 IT COMES OVER AND THE STRING AS IT DOES THIS IT'S GOING TO WHIP AROUND THE SIDE OF YOUR WRIST
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_21 0 IT'S GOING TO SHOOT UNDERNEATH YOUR WRIST AND IT COMES IN AND CONNECTS WITH THE YOYO GAP AND YOU'LL CATCH IT LIKE SO
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_22 0 LET ME SHOW YOU AGAIN WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_23 0 SO LET'S HOLD IT LIKE THAT YOU WHIP IT UNDERNEATH AND INTO THE YOYO GAP JUST LIKE SO
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_24 0 ONE MORE TIME
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_25 0 IT LOOKS LIKE THAT
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_26 0 ONE OF THE KEY THINGS TO THINK ABOUT IS YOU WANT TO TRY AND LINE UP THE STRING WITH THE EDGE OF YOUR WRIST KIND OF
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_27 0 THAT'S GOING TO HELP WHEN YOU COME TOWARDS THE YOYO
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_28 0 YOU'LL LINE THAT UP WITH YOUR WRIST LINE UP THE STRING AND THEN LINE UP THE YOYO GAP INTO THAT
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_29 0 THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HELP YOU HOOK THE YOYO INTO IT
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_30 0 TO GET OUT OF IT ONCE YOU'RE IN IT BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF A WEIRD MOUNT
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_31 0 YOU ACTUALLY JUST TAKE YOUR THROW HAND POINTER I MEAN YOU'RE NON THROW HAND POINTER PUSH IT INTO THE STRING AND POP OUT OF IT
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_32 0 IT WILL COME RIGHT OUT
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_33 0 YOU WANT POP OUT THE BACK SIDE OF IT
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_34 0 ONCE AGAIN IT LOOKS LIKE LET ME DO IT FROM THIS ANGLE FOR YOU
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_35 0 IT LOOKS LIKE THIS
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_36 0 SO WE WRIST WHIP IT PUSH YOUR FINGER IN AND YOU POP BACK OUT JUST LIKE SO
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_37 0 THAT'S A BASIC WRIST WHIP TO DO WHAT I WAS DOING BEFORE WITH MORE VARIATIONS YOU CAN JUST WHIP AROUND AND THEN HOOK IN WITH YOUR WRIST
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_38 0 YOU CAN DO IT ABOUT AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT JUST PRACTICE IT
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_39 0 TWO IS USUALLY A GOOD ONE TO START WITH
hiXbEZ1Ikc0_40 0 PRACTICE IT DO IT AND IMPRESS PEOPLE

GyKi1E8tHdM_4 0 THIS IS A VICE-GRIP STYLE OF WRENCH THAT ACTUALLY LOCKS ON THE NUT THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON SO YOU CAN USE THE OTHER HAND TO LOOSEN OR TIGHTEN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOLT
GyKi1E8tHdM_5 0 THERE'S THIS LOCK-CHANNEL TYPE WRENCH THIS IS VERY USEFUL FOR PLUMBING OR AUTOMOTIVE AND GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE LEVERAGE ON SMALLER BOLTS AND NUTS AND SO FORTH

GyKi1E8tHdM_7 0 THIS IS A FAIRLY STANDARD WRENCH THAT YOU CAN USE AROUND THE HOUSE
GyKi1E8tHdM_8 0 IT'S ESPECIALLY GOOD FOR ELECTRICAL BECAUSE OF THE TYPE OF NOSE IT HAS
GyKi1E8tHdM_9 0 IT'S GOOD FOR TWISTING WIRES OR PULLING WIRES THROUGH THE WALL AND SO FORTH
GyKi1E8tHdM_10 0 THIS IS A FAIRLY STANDARD WRENCH

hC351ByQDII_1 0 FOR THE OFF-ROAD TRIATHLON YOU CAN STILL DO A PORTION OF YOUR TRAINING ON YOUR ROAD BIKE
hC351ByQDII_2 0 EASY DAYS TECHNIQUE DAYS WHERE WE EMPHASIZE SPIN AND YOU SHOULD RIDE BETWEEN EIGHTY AND 100 RPM'S
hC351ByQDII_3 0 NINETY IS IDEAL
hC351ByQDII_4 0 MOST TRIATHLETES ARE IN THE BAD HABIT OF PUSHING TOO BIG OF A GEAR AND IT'S NOT EFFICIENT
hC351ByQDII_5 0 IT OVERLY TAXES YOUR MUSCLES AND DOESN'T PUT ENOUGH ONUS ON YOUR CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM
hC351ByQDII_6 0 SO TRY TO WORK ON THOSE EASY DAY ON A SMOOTH PEDAL STROKE SITTING REAL SQUARE IN THE SADDLE AND PEDALING NICE CIRCLES
hC351ByQDII_7 0 EQUAL PRESSURE ON THE PEDALS ALL THE WAY AROUND
hC351ByQDII_8 0 FOR YOUR LONG DAYS THOSE ARE GREAT ONES TO DO ON A MOUNTAIN BIKE BECAUSE THOSE ARE DAYS THAT YOU CAN GET OUT AND HAVE FUN EXPLORE SOME TRAILS AND WORK ON YOUR HANDLING ABILITIES
hC351ByQDII_9 0 AND THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO PROVE YOUR HANDLING ABILITIES THAN TO JUST CHALLENGE YOURSELF BY FINDING DIFFICULT TECHNICAL TRAILS
hC351ByQDII_10 0 IF YOU CAN SPEND SOME TIME WITH OTHER RIDERS WHO ARE SKILLED IN OFF-ROAD RIDING AND PICK UP TIPS FROM THEM THAT'LL HELP AS WELL
hC351ByQDII_11 0 BUT ONE THING THAT YOU DO WHEN YOU RIDE OFF-ROAD IS YOU HAVE TO SHIFT YOUR WEIGHT AROUND A LOT TO MAINTAIN TRACTION
hC351ByQDII_12 0 AND SO IF YOU CAN FIND A CHALLENGING TRAIL AND ACTUALLY TIME YOURSELF ON IT AND DO REPEATS ON THAT TRAIL AND TRY TO CLEAN UP YOUR TURNING CLEAN UP YOUR SHIFTING OF YOUR WEIGHT WHERE YOU SHIFT ON THE SHIFT GEARS AND THOSE THINGS
hC351ByQDII_13 0 THAT'LL HELP YOU IMPROVE
hC351ByQDII_14 0 BUT LONG DAYS CAN BE DONE ON THE MOUNTAIN BIKE
hC351ByQDII_15 0 IN A BASE PERIOD WE DO MORE EXTENSIVE ENDURANCE WHICH CAN BE DONE ON A ROAD BIKE AS WELL YOU DON'T GET THE SKILL DEVELOPMENT PIECE
hC351ByQDII_16 0 LONG RIDES AT A LOW INTENSITY WHICH AS YOU GET CLOSER TO THE SEASON THAT INTENSITY SHOULD COME UP AND THE DURATION OF THE RIDE SHOULD COME DOWN
hC351ByQDII_17 0 INTERVAL DAYS FOR AN OFF-ROAD TRIATHLON SHOULD BE DONE ON YOUR MOUNTAIN BIKE
hC351ByQDII_18 0 AND THOSE SHOULD BE SPECIFIC TO THE KIND OF CHALLENGES YOU'LL FACE WHEN YOU RACE THIS
hC351ByQDII_19 0 SO IF THE COURSES YOU FACE WILL BE VERY TECHNICAL RIDE THE TECHNICAL TRAILS
hC351ByQDII_20 0 IF THEY'LL HAVE LOTS OF SHORT STEEP CLIMBS FIND A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN DO SHORT STEEP CLIMBS
hC351ByQDII_21 0 AND IF IT'S EXTENDED CLIMBS SAME SORT OF A THING
hC351ByQDII_22 0 DO INTERVALS ESPECIALLY CLIMBING INTERVALS FOR THE OFF-ROAD TRIATHLON THAT REPLICATE WHAT YOU'LL FACE IN YOUR RACE

hdUwm9SRFb4_1 0 MY NAME IS SHAWN CONNELLY AND I LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA AND I'M SPONSORED AND I ALSO RUN A SKATEBOARD PROGRAM FOR KIDS CALLED THE SF SKATE CLUB
hdUwm9SRFb4_2 0 NOW WHAT I'M HERE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU IS HOW TO DO THE FAKIE OLLIE
hdUwm9SRFb4_3 0 NOW YOU SHOULDN'T TRY FAKIE OLLIES UNTIL YOU'VE GOT CLEAN OLLIES ROLLING FORWARD AND ONCE YOU'VE GOT THOSE DOWN AND YOU'RE ABLE TO POP THEM NICE AND CLEANLY AND DO THEM ROLLING PRETTY FAST
hdUwm9SRFb4_4 0 YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO TAKE THEM ROLLING BACKWARDS AND DO THE EXACT SAME THING AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS SET UP IN A VERY SIMILAR FOOT POSITION AS YOU WOULD ROLLING FORWARD FOR THE FAKIE OLLIE
hdUwm9SRFb4_5 0 ONLY NOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COMPENSATE FOR TRAVELING BACKWARDS AND LEAN A LITTLE FURTHER TOWARDS YOUR FORWARD DIRECTION TO GET YOU NICE AND EVEN WHILE ROLLING BACKWARDS
hdUwm9SRFb4_6 0 NOW YOU WANT TO SPEND SOME TIME ROLLING BACKWARDS AND GETTING COMFORTABLE IN THIS POSITION BECAUSE SINCE YOU DON'T ROLL BACKWARDS VERY OFTEN IT CAN SOMETIMES CATCH YOU OFF GUARD IF YOU HIT SOMETHING TO ROLL AND FALL DIRECTLY IN THE DIRECTION YOU'RE HEADED SO YOU'RE ROLLING BACKWARDS AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR FEET IN THE OLLIE POSITION
hdUwm9SRFb4_7 0 NICE TOE ON THE TIP OF THE TAIL FOOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOARD READY TO DRAG IT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE NOSE
hdUwm9SRFb4_8 0 YOU POP IT AND YOU TRAVEL AND LEAN A LITTLE MORE FORWARD AND THEN YOU LAND NICE AND CLEAN AND ROLL AWAY FAKIE AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO A FAKIE OLLIE
hdUwm9SRFb4_9 0 MY NAME IS SHAWN CONNOLLY AND I LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA AND I RUN A SKATEBOARD PROGRAM CALLED SF SKATE CLUB AND YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE AT SFSKATECLUB.COM
Gpsbz0QQifw_2 0 THIS IS JON ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
Gpsbz0QQifw_3 0 IN THIS VIDEO CLIP I WILL BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO USE YOUR SAWHORSES
Gpsbz0QQifw_4 0 YOU WANT TO POSITION YOUR SAWHORSES SO THAT THE MATERIAL YOU ARE CUTTING HANGS OFF A LITTLE BIT ON EACH SIDE
Gpsbz0QQifw_5 0 YOU WANT THE CUT END OF YOUR MATERIAL TO DROP OFF OF ONE SIDE SO THAT WHEN YOU RUN THE SAW DOWN HERE IT WILL FALL OFF THE SIDE ON TO THE GROUND
Gpsbz0QQifw_6 0 WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS BE CUTTING YOUR MATERIAL IN THE MIDDLE OF BOTH OF YOUR SAWHORSES BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET ALMOST THE WAY THROUGH THE END IS JUST GOING TO BREAK AND FALL IN THE CENTER AND YOU COULD POTENTIALLY GET INJURED
Gpsbz0QQifw_7 0 ANOTHER NICE THING ABOUT SAWHORSES IS BECAUSE THERE ARE LOTS OF LEDGES ON THE DIFFERENT BOARDS YOU CAN EASILY CLAMP YOUR WORK PIECE TO THE SAWHORSE TO HELP SECURE IT
Gpsbz0QQifw_8 0 ANOTHER TIP THAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP SECURE MATERIAL IS TO TAKE A SCREW AND PUT IT THROUGH YOUR MATERIAL INTO YOUR SAWHORSE
Gpsbz0QQifw_9 0 SINCE YOUR SAWHORSE IS MADE OF WOOD YOU CAN EASILY SCREW THAT IN AND SECURE IT

hCUWDJv8A_U_9 0 IF YOU LIKE THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH THAT WORKS WELL
hCUWDJv8A_U_10 0 IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM I'M IN LOVE WITH THAT PERSON BUT I DON'T LIKE THEM THAT DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL
hCUWDJv8A_U_11 0 IT HAS TO BE BOTH
hCUWDJv8A_U_12 0 AND THE KEY TO THAT IS SINCERITY
hCUWDJv8A_U_13 0 SO THE ANSWER TO THIS IS MAKE IT SIMPLE BE SINCERE IN EVERY AREA INCLUDING THE SMALL AREAS SO THEN PEOPLE TRUST YOU
hCUWDJv8A_U_14 0 BASICALLY IT'S BASED ON TRUST

Gg6FWda0LqU_3 0 INDIAN COOKING IS KNOW FOR IT'S DISTINGUISHED USE OF HERBS AND SPICES
Gg6FWda0LqU_4 0 IN FACT THE BRITISH LEARNED FROM US
Gg6FWda0LqU_5 0 THEY WERE JUST EATING MASHED POTATOES WITH SALT AND PEPPER
Gg6FWda0LqU_6 0 WE ARE HERE TODAY TO MAKE A STUFFED POTATO TORTILLA WHICH IS BASICALLY A WHOLE WHEAT BREAD STUFFED WITH POTATOES
Gg6FWda0LqU_7 0 THE TORTILLA IS THE STAPLE DIET FOR NORTH INDIANS
Gg6FWda0LqU_8 0 THE SECOND DISH IS GOING TO BE A PAKORA
Gg6FWda0LqU_9 0 IT'S VEGETABLES DIPPED IN A BATTER AND DEEP FRIED
Gg6FWda0LqU_10 0 THE THIRD DISH IS INDIAN CURRY
Gg6FWda0LqU_11 0 EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT CURRY IS BUT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT IS THE BASE OF A CURRY
Gg6FWda0LqU_12 0 I'M AN EXPERT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN COOKING FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS
Gg6FWda0LqU_13 0 I WAS MARRIED FOR EIGHT YEARS AND I COOKED FOR TWENTY PEOPLE A DAY BREAKFAST LUNCH AND DINNER
Gg6FWda0LqU_14 0 INDIAN FOOD IS GOOD FOR YOU
Gg6FWda0LqU_15 0 BASICALLY YOU START FROM SCRATCH SO THE VEGETABLES ARE FRESH
Gg6FWda0LqU_16 0 THE ONIONS THE GINGER THE GARLIC
Gg6FWda0LqU_17 0 EVERYTHING IS SO FRESH
Gg6FWda0LqU_18 0 NOTHING IS PROCESSED
Gg6FWda0LqU_19 0 THE ADDITION OF HERBS AND SPICES MAKES IT SO FLAVORFUL SO YOUR PALLET IS SATISFIED SO YOU EAT LESS
Gg6FWda0LqU_20 0 YOU CAN EAT A LOT AND NOT PUT ON WEIGHT
Gg6FWda0LqU_21 0 I DID WANT TO SHOW MY EXPERIENCE
Gg6FWda0LqU_22 0 I WAS COOKING FOR EIGHT YEARS FOR TWENTY PEOPLE IN JOINED FAMILY IN A LITTLE KITCHEN
Gg6FWda0LqU_23 0 I HAD TO COVER MY HEAD
Gg6FWda0LqU_24 0 MY MOTHER-IN-LAW AND FATHER-IN-LAW LIVED WITH ME AND COOK
Gg6FWda0LqU_25 0 YOU KNOW INDIA IS WARM
Gg6FWda0LqU_26 0 WHEN YOU SAY HOT
Gg6FWda0LqU_27 0 IT'S LIKE 110 115 DEGREES AND WE HAD TO COVER OUR HEAD AND COOK BUT THE FOOD WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT
Gg6FWda0LqU_28 0 I'M SURE EVERYBODY ENJOYED IT
Gg6FWda0LqU_29 0 ALRIGHT LET'S GO AHEAD AND START OUT WITH THE INDIAN CURRY
h3ZeKbQqquI_1 0 SO THE NEXT THING WE'RE GOING TO BUILD IS I'M GOING TO BUILD A CONE
h3ZeKbQqquI_2 0 SO WHAT I'VE DONE HERE IS DUG A HOLE AND PLACED A BUNCH OF LOOSE SAND IN IT AND I FILLED A FEW BUCKETS OF WATER UP CAME UP AND SATURATED THE SAND SO I HAVE GOOD WORKING SAND RIGHT NEXT TO THE SITE WHERE I'M BUILDING MY SANDCASTLE
h3ZeKbQqquI_3 0 TO BEGIN WITH OUR FOUNDATION I'M GOING TO BUILD STARTING WITH THE INSIDE OUT
h3ZeKbQqquI_4 0 WE'LL USE SCOOPS OF THE SAND WE JUST GOT READY
h3ZeKbQqquI_5 0 HERE IS WHERE I'M GOING TO USE THE TECHNIQUE OF HAND FORMING
h3ZeKbQqquI_6 0 I'M GOING TO BUILD A CONE AND USING YOUR HAND FORMING TECHNIQUE KEEPING THE BASE WIDER THAN THE TOP
h3ZeKbQqquI_7 0 ONCE YOU BUILD YOUR BASE YOU CAN BEGIN TO ADD ON THE TOP OF IT BY USING JUST HAND FORMING PACKING PILES OF SAND ON THE SIDES
h3ZeKbQqquI_8 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO REMEMBER TO KEEP POURING WATER ON IT BECAUSE THE WETTER IT IS THE MORE COMPACT THE SAND WILL BE AND IT WILL STICK TOGETHER AND MAKE IT EASIER TO BUILD
h3ZeKbQqquI_9 0 SO HERE WE HAVE OUR FOUNDATION THAT WE STARTED WITH
h3ZeKbQqquI_10 0 I BEGAN BUILDING FROM THE CENTER POINT OF MY AREA AND I'VE DESIGNED MY CONE SHAPE THAT IS GOING TO BE THE CENTRAL PART OF THE SANDCASTLE
h5DqUbgoCrQ_1 0 TOM SMITH HI
h5DqUbgoCrQ_2 0 MY NAME IS TOM
h5DqUbgoCrQ_3 0 THIS IS FOR EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
h5DqUbgoCrQ_4 0 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO PLAY KEYBOARDS IN A BAND IN A WORSHIP TEAM AT A CHURCH
h5DqUbgoCrQ_5 0 WE'VE GOT DIFFERENT SOUNDS
h5DqUbgoCrQ_6 0 WE'VE TALKED ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN PLAY DURING A CHORUS
h5DqUbgoCrQ_7 0 I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TRYING TO ADD SPARKLE OR A LITTLE BIT OF COLOR
h5DqUbgoCrQ_8 0 AND THERE'S SOME BASIC MUSICAL WAYS TO DO THAT BUT SOMETIMES IN A BAND SETTING WE FORGET ABOUT THAT
h5DqUbgoCrQ_9 0 WE'RE JUST TRYING TO PUSH OUR OWN VOLUME UP SO THAT WE CAN BE HEARD
h5DqUbgoCrQ_10 0 ONE OF THE WAYS IS TO LOOK AT THE OVERALL DYNAMICS OF THE SOUND
h5DqUbgoCrQ_11 0 I CAN'T EMPHASIZE IT ENOUGH YOU GOT TO BE LISTENING TO WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS DOING BUT MAYBE YOU PULL BACK IN VOLUME
h5DqUbgoCrQ_12 0 SO FOR INSTANCE IF I'M PLAYING A PASSAGE I'LL JUST SIT ON MY VOLUME WHETHER IT'S A PEDAL OR A SWITCH AND PLAY WITH THE VOLUME
h5DqUbgoCrQ_13 0 THE SECOND THING YOU CAN DO IF FOR INSTANCE DURING A CHORUS IF THE CHORUS BUILDS A BIT AND THE WORDS BUILD A BIT I'LL BUMP UP THE VOLUME A BIT
h5DqUbgoCrQ_14 0 MAYBE I'LL PLAY MORE NOTES
h5DqUbgoCrQ_15 0 AS YOU'RE BUILDING YOU CAN ADD MORE NOTES
h5DqUbgoCrQ_16 0 SPEED IS ANOTHER THING TOO
h5DqUbgoCrQ_17 0 I MAY BE PLAYING JUST AN OPEN FIFTH BUT THEN ON THE CHORUS I WANT TO ADD A LITTLE BIT OF COLOR AND SPARKLE AND BUILD IT A BIT SO I'LL ADD A LITTLE VOLUME AND I'LL GO TO ARPEGGIO
h5DqUbgoCrQ_18 0 SO I MAY BE PLAYING THE VERSE LIKE THIS
h5DqUbgoCrQ_19 0 AND THEN WHEN I HIT THE CHORUS I MIGHT JUMP UP WHICH IS ANOTHER TECHNIQUE IS WHERE YOU ARE ON THE KEYBOARD
h5DqUbgoCrQ_20 0 SO DEPENDING ON WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE PLAYING I MIGHT JUMP AN OCTAVE BUMP THE VOLUME AND IN THE CHORUS START PLAYING ARPEGGIOS
h5DqUbgoCrQ_21 0 SO JUST BY DOING SOME OF THOSE TECHNIQUES ALL BASIC TECHNIQUES BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THEM AND APPLY THEM IT CAN REALLY HELP COLOR AND GET YOU TO FIT IN IN THAT TEAM

hIXdmmCQnzc_2 0 WEST COAST TRACKS ARE YOU KNOW A LOT SOME THINGS ARE SIMILAR TO THE EAST COAST TRACKS AND THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT
hIXdmmCQnzc_3 0 THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO WHEN YOU'RE MAKING A WEST COAST TRACK YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR BREAK BEATS
hIXdmmCQnzc_4 0 A LOT OF WEST COAST TRACKS DON'T USE THAT
hIXdmmCQnzc_5 0 BUT IF YOU WANT TO USE THAT IN YOUR WEST COAST TRACKS GO RIGHT AHEAD
hIXdmmCQnzc_6 0 BUT THE FIRST THING I WOULD SUGGEST YOU DO IS START WITH THE TEMPO
hIXdmmCQnzc_7 0 THE TEMPOS ARE GOING TO BE ABOUT THE SAME FOR EAST COAST TRACK
hIXdmmCQnzc_8 0 YOU COULD PROBABLY DO IT AROUND NINETY AND YOU KNOW YOU COULD MAYBE DO IT A LITTLE BIT FASTER
hIXdmmCQnzc_9 0 I WOULDN'T GO ABOVE A HUNDRED AND TEN ON THE TEMPO
hIXdmmCQnzc_10 0 BUT JUST FROM SOMEWHERE BETWEEN NINETY A HUNDRED AND TEN
hIXdmmCQnzc_11 0 I LIKE TO KEEP IT BETWEEN NINETY AND A HUNDRED
hIXdmmCQnzc_12 0 I STARTED OFF MAKING EAST COAST TRACKS
hIXdmmCQnzc_13 0 BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE CAME TO ME WANTING WEST COAST TRACKS SO I HAD THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND SO I HAD TO MAKE THE WEST COAST TRACKS
hIXdmmCQnzc_14 0 SO I KIND OF KEEP MY WEST COAST TRACKS ABOUT IN THE SAME TEMPO AS MY EAST COAST TRACKS
hIXdmmCQnzc_15 0 I JUST DO DIFFERENT THINGS TO CHANGE IT UP
hIXdmmCQnzc_16 0 SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU LET YOU LISTEN TO A TEMPO THAT I SET FOR A WEST COAST TRACK

GvwwpFh_d2w_1 0 NOW WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MEDICATIONS SPECIFICALLY FOR OUR CANINE PATIENTS OR DOGS
GvwwpFh_d2w_2 0 THERE ARE A LOT OF MEDICATIONS WE USE IN DOGS
GvwwpFh_d2w_3 0 A LOT OF THOSE MEDICATIONS WE ACTUALLY CANNOT USE IN CATS AND SO THERE ARE SOME CANINE SPECIFIC MEDICATIONS
GvwwpFh_d2w_4 0 WE USE A LOT OF DRUGS FOR THEIR EYES
GvwwpFh_d2w_5 0 DOGS SEEM TO GET A LOT OF INJURIES TO THEIR EYES AND WE USE A LOT OF OPTHALMOLOGIC DRUGS SUCH AS TOPICAL DROPS THAT WE CAN PUT IN THEIR EYES FOR ULCERS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE
GvwwpFh_d2w_6 0 WE ALSO IN OUR CANINE PATIENTS USE A LOT OF GASTROINTESTINAL MEDICATIONS
GvwwpFh_d2w_7 0 THEY TEND TO EAT A LOT OF THINGS THAT THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO EAT AND GET A LOT OF STOMACH UPSETS AND A LOT OF DIARRHEA
GvwwpFh_d2w_8 0 WE HAVE SOME REALLY EXTRAORDINARY MEDICATIONS THESE DAYS FOR OUR CANINE PATIENTS AS FAR AS PREVENTING VOMITING AND CONTROLLING DIARRHEA AND GI STATES LIKE THAT
GvwwpFh_d2w_9 0 WE ALSO SPECIFICALLY IN THE CANINE USE A LOT OF CARDIAC DRUGS
GvwwpFh_d2w_10 0 THERE ARE SOME NEW CARDIAC MEDICATIONS TO TREAT HEART FAILURE TO TREAT HEART DISEASES OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES AND THEY ARE WORKING VERY WELL AND WE'RE CONTROLLING A LOT OF OUR CANINE'S HEART DISEASES IN THIS MANNER
GvwwpFh_d2w_11 0 WE ALSO OF COURSE IN DOGS TREAT A LOT OF INFECTIONS BITE WOUNDS TOE NAIL INFECTIONS ALL SORTS OF THINGS WITH ANTIBIOTICS
GvwwpFh_d2w_12 0 ANTIBIOTICS ARE A VERY COMMON WAY OF DEALING WITH LOTS OF INFECTIONS AND THEY CAN COME IN AN INJECTABLE FORM VERSUS A TABLET FORM AND IN SOME SITUATIONS THESE TABLETS ARE ACTUALLY CHEWABLES AND THEY ARE FLAVORED FOR OUR CANINE PATIENTS SO THEY WILL ACTUALLY EAT THEM EASIER
GvwwpFh_d2w_13 0 WE ALSO IN OUR CANINE PATIENTS USE A LT OF ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES FOR ARTHRITIS AND PAIN

GvwwpFh_d2w_18 0 YOU CAN'T USE THESE IN CATS BUT YOU CAN IN DOGS
GvwwpFh_d2w_19 0 ANOTHER CLASS THAT WE USE A LOT UNFORTUNATELY IS DOGS HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ALLERGIES TO OUR ENVIRONMENT WHETHER THAT IS DUST OR POLLEN OR FOOD
GvwwpFh_d2w_20 0 WE USE A LOT OF ANTIHISTAMINES A LOT OF DIFFERENT ANTIHISTAMINES ARE IN TABLET FORM AND WE ARE COMMONLY USING A LOT OF OVER-THE-COUNTER MEDICATIONS THESE DAYS TOO ANTIHISTAMINES AND THAT SORT OF THING TO TREAT ALLERGIES

gcaXuKF6Bgk_8 0 JUST KEEP PLAYING WITH IT HAVE FUN AND DON'T LET IT IF YOU START HAVING PROBLEMS WITH IT IT CLOGS UP TAKE A MOMENT PULL THE NEEDLE OUT CLEAN IT DUMP YOUR PAINT OUT AND JUST GIVE IT JUST A LIGHT CLEANING
gcaXuKF6Bgk_9 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY TAKE IT APART AND WIPE EVERYTHING DOWN BUT JUST GET THE CLOG OUT OF THE END OF THE TIP
gcaXuKF6Bgk_10 0 AND SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT WANT TO JUST TAKE YOUR FINGER AND JUST PULL THE PAINT BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT WILL DRY AROUND THE END OF THE NEEDLE

goUfZl6Zy9w_5 0 BE CAREFUL WITH THIS ONE IT HAS NO MIXERS IN IT IT IS JUST LIQUOR
goUfZl6Zy9w_6 0 MAKE SURE YOU SHAKE IT UP NICE AND COLD AND YOUR ONLY PSEUDO MIXER IS GOING TO BE THAT ICE TO WATER IT DOWN
goUfZl6Zy9w_7 0 THIS IS WHAT IT IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE NICE YELLOW COLOR FOR YOU THERE AND YOUR EARTHQUAKE #1 IS VERY SIMPLE
goUfZl6Zy9w_8 0 NOW BECAUSE IT IS EQUAL AMOUNTS OF GIN WHISKEY AND PERNOD YOU CAN UP THE OUNCES TO A FULL OUNCE AND MAYBE MAKE TWO AND MAKE YOURSELF A BIGGER MARTINI
goUfZl6Zy9w_9 0 YOU COULD UP THE OUNCES TO TWO OUNCES AND YOU GET IT AND GO ON AND ON AND ON UNTIL YOU MAKE A WHOLE PITCHER
goUfZl6Zy9w_10 0 THERE YOU GO CHEERS
G-MxE0UV-fY_1 0 WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE ON WITH THE REST OF OUR VEGETABLES
G-MxE0UV-fY_2 0 WE WILL TAKE A RING OF OUR WHITE ONION AND REMOVE THE OUTER LAYER OF SKIN AND WE'LL CUT RIGHT ACROSS DICING OUR ONION AND WE'LL PULL OUT TWO CLOVES OF GARLIC AND WE'LL CUT OFF THE BROWN STEM ENDS
G-MxE0UV-fY_3 0 WE'LL MINCE THESE AND THEN WE'LL GO BACK TO OUR BURNER AND TURN THIS BACK UP TO EIGHT AND WE'LL HEAT A TABLESPOON OF OIL
GEJgqfNAbdg_1 0 OK THIS ASSIGN THIS NEXT STRETCH IS JUST A FORWARD FOLD OR A FORWARD BEND
GEJgqfNAbdg_2 0 SO FROM THE POSITION WE LEFT OFF AND SITTING NICE AND TALL KEEPING BOTH HIP BONES ON THE FLOOR WE'RE JUST GOING TO EXHALE AND REACH FORWARD REACHING FORWARD TOWARDS THE WALL IN FRONT OF YOU RATHER THAN STRAIGHT DOWN AND WITH YOU EXHALATION DROPPING DOWN FARTHER
GEJgqfNAbdg_3 0 DROPPING THE CHEST OVER THE KNEES AND THE HEAD TOWARD THE SHIN
GEJgqfNAbdg_4 0 EVERY INHALATION YOU LIFT EVERY EXHALATION DROPPING LOWER AND DEEPER INTO THE STRETCH
GEJgqfNAbdg_5 0 INHALE LIFT AND EXHALE DROPPING A LITTLE DEEPER INTO THE STRETCH
GEJgqfNAbdg_6 0 IF YOU HAVE A STRAP OR A BELT YOU CAN USE THAT OR IT YOU CAN REACH YOUR FEET YOU CAN ALSO USE YOUR BICEPS TO PULL IN TO LENGTHEN AND DEEPEN THE STRETCH
GEJgqfNAbdg_7 0 SO JUST HOLDING HERE WITH DEEP BREATHS IN EXHALE RELEASING IT OUT AND THEN YOU WANT TO THOSE A SECOND OR THIRD TIME SO YOU KIND OF JUST ROLL IT UP AND THEN EXHALE AND TAKE IT DOWN AGAIN
hbJfSyJKBEA_1 0 THE FIRST THING THAT WE HAVE TO DO IS STRESS INTEREST AND RELEVANCE AND BASICALLY WHEN I TALK ABOUT INTEREST AND RELEVANCE I'M TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT YOUR AUDIENCE
hbJfSyJKBEA_2 0 YOU HAVE TO ANALYZE YOUR AUDIENCE
hbJfSyJKBEA_3 0 YOU HAVE TO KNOWS WHAT THEIR MAKEUP IS ARE THEY MEN ARE THEY WOMEN ARE THEY OLD ARE THEY YOUNG ARE THEY INTO SPORTS NOT INTO SPORTS ARE THEY RELIGIOUS NOT RELIGIOUS WHATEVER IT IS AND THEN WHAT IN YOUR SPEECH IS GOING TO BE RELEVANT TO THEM WHAT CAN THEY RELATE TO
hbJfSyJKBEA_4 0 THOSE ARE THE THINGS IN YOUR SPEECH THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GIVE EXTRA EMPHASIS OR EXTRA STRESS TO
hbJfSyJKBEA_5 0 NOW YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY PICKED YOUR TOPIC BECAUSE YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT IT AND YOU'VE PICKED YOUR TOPIC BECAUSE YOUR AUDIENCE WILL LIKE IT
hbJfSyJKBEA_6 0 BUT WHAT ARE THE THINGS WITHIN YOUR SPEECH THAT YOU CAN REALLY HIT FOR THE AUDIENCE TO RELATE TO
hbJfSyJKBEA_7 0 IF THEY RELATE TO YOU OR TO SOMETHING IN YOUR SPEECH IT WILL BE MEMORABLE FOR THEM
gZJmZ5Dxljw_1 0 DO EVER PLAY SPADES
gZJmZ5Dxljw_2 0 WOULD YOU LIKE TO PUT ON YOUR OWN TOURNAMENT
gZJmZ5Dxljw_3 0 HI MY NAME IS DEAN HALE AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME INFORMATION TODAY ABOUT HOW TO PUT ON YOUR OWN SPADES TOURNAMENT
gZJmZ5Dxljw_4 0 A SPADES TOURNAMENT WOULD NORMALLY HAVE THIRTY-TWO PLAYERS
gZJmZ5Dxljw_5 0 SO WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS HAVE REGISTRATION
gZJmZ5Dxljw_6 0 PICK A REGISTRATION FEE TEN TWENTY TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS PER PLAYER AND WHEN YOU COME IN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE TEAM CAPTAIN DRAW A NUMBER FROM ONE THROUGH SIXTEEN OUT OF A HAT
gZJmZ5Dxljw_7 0 THAT WOULD BE THE TEAM THAT THEY ARE ON
gZJmZ5Dxljw_8 0 WHEN YOU HAVE THE TWO PLAYERS ON THE SAME TEAM YOU SIT THEM AT OTHER TABLES
gZJmZ5Dxljw_9 0 YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SIXTEEN TABLES SET UP AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS HAVE FOUR ROUNDS OF PLAY THAT ARE GOING TO CONSIST OF THIRTY MINUTE ROUNDS
gZJmZ5Dxljw_10 0 EACH ROUND YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY TO A POINT TOTAL OF TWO-HUNDRED FIFTY
gZJmZ5Dxljw_11 0 IF IN THIRTY MINUTES THE TWO-HUNDRED FIFTY POINT TOTAL HAS NOT BEEN REACHED THE TEAM WITH THE HIGHEST SCORE IS GOING TO WIN THAT ROUND
gZJmZ5Dxljw_12 0 NOW WITH SIXTEEN TEAMS YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY FOUR ROUNDS SO YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY DOWN TIL YOU HAVE THE FINAL TWO TEAMS
gZJmZ5Dxljw_13 0 THE TEAM THAT WINS IN THE FINAL ROUND OF THE THIRTY MINUTES IS DECLARED THE CHAMPION
gZJmZ5Dxljw_14 0 THE BASIC RULES OF SPADES ARE GOING TO BE THE SAME AS ANY OTHER SPADES GAME EXCEPT YOU'RE PLAYING WITH A TIME LIMIT ROUNDS AND YOU'RE PLAYING TO TWO-HUNDRED FIFTY POINTS PER ROUND WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN USUAL SO MAKE SURE YOU ADJUST YOUR GAME ACCORDINGLY AND KNOW THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE A HIGH POINT TOTAL VERY QUICKLY
gZJmZ5Dxljw_15 0 MY NAME'S DEAN HALE AND THAT'S THE BASICS FOR PUTTING ON A SPADES TOURNAMENT
G8oDEk3rixY_1 0 ALSO WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH AN OLDER OR GERIATRIC DOG YOU WANT TO WATCH INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YOUR OLDER DOG AND YOUNG DOGS OR PUPPIES
G8oDEk3rixY_2 0 HERE WE'VE GOT RAVEN WHO IS JUST AN OLDER PUPPY
G8oDEk3rixY_3 0 SHE'S ABOUT A YEAR OLD SHE'S QUITE PLAYFUL STILL
G8oDEk3rixY_4 0 AND WE'VE GOT HANNAH WHO'S ABOUT TWELVE YEAR ROTTY AND WHO'S NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN PLAYING
G8oDEk3rixY_5 0 IF SHE GETS KNOCKED DOWN SHE COULD GET HURT BUT RAVEN MIGHT NOT ACTUALLY HAVE THE SENSE AT THIS AGE TO KNOW THAT SHE'S CAN'T PLAY WITH HANNAH THE WAY THAT SHE PLAYS WITH HER OTHER BUDDIES
G8oDEk3rixY_6 0 SO WHEN WE GOT A YOUNGER DOG OR A PUPPY AND WE'VE GOT A GERIATRIC DOG WE NEED TO GIVE THE GERIATRIC DOG LOTS OF SPACE
G8oDEk3rixY_7 0 WE NEED TO GIVE THEM A PLACE IN THE HOUSE WHERE THEY CAN GET AWAY FROM THE YOUNGER DOGS
G8oDEk3rixY_8 0 WE'RE DEALING WITH RAVEN HERE IS A LITTLE BIG OLDER PUPPY BUT IF WE HAD A VERY VERY SMALL PUPPY THEY HAVE EVEN LESS SENSE AND MORE PLAY DRIVE IN MANY WAYS AND WE WOULD HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT GIVING OUR OLDER GERIATRIC DOG A SAFE QUIET PLACE TO INTERACT WITH WHEN THEY'RE INSIDE AS WELL AS WHEN THEY'RE OUTSIDE
G8oDEk3rixY_9 0 NOT ONLY COULD THE GERIATRIC DOG GET HURT BUT THE PUPPY COULD ACTUALLY GET HURT AS WELL IF THE GERIATRIC DOG THE OLDER DOG DECIDED THAT THEY HAD ENOUGH OF THE MESSING AROUND AND WAS GETTING HARASSED THEY COULD ACTUALLY TURN ON
G8oDEk3rixY_10 0 IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE IN THAT CASE BUT IT WOULDN'T BE AN EXPERIENCE THAT WE WANT THE PUPPY TO HAVE
G8oDEk3rixY_11 0 SO JUST BE AWARE THAT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN A PUPPY AND AN OLDER DOG NEEDS TO MODERATED NEEDS TO MONITORED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE YOUNGER DOG IS NOT HARASSING THE OLDER DOG
G8oDEk3rixY_12 0 AND IF THE OLDER DOG HAS GOT A PLACE THAT THEY CAN RETREAT TO FOR SOME PEACE AND QUIET
GFQvc95oiY8_1 0 HI THERE I'M TRACY GOODWIN AND I'M THE RED SWEATER LADY
GFQvc95oiY8_2 0 AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO ACHIEVE CONVERSATIONAL STYLE WHEN GIVING SPEECHES
GFQvc95oiY8_3 0 AND WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS THERE'S SO MUCH ANXIETY WHEN YOU'RE GIVING SPEECHES ANYWAY BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT WE WANT TO DO AS A SPEECH GIVER OR A PRESENTER IS COME ACROSS LIKE WE'RE TALKING TO THE AUDIENCE NOT AT THE AUDIENCE
GFQvc95oiY8_4 0 SPEECHES EVEN IF THEY'RE DONE IN A FORMAL SETTING SHOULD NOT HAVE A FORMAL QUALITY TO THEM
GFQvc95oiY8_5 0 THEY SHOULD BE VERY INTERPERSONAL
GFQvc95oiY8_6 0 THAT'S THE WAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOUR AUDIENCE TO RELATE TO YOU WHICH MEANS YOUR AUDIENCE IS GOING TO UNDERSTAND YOU SUPPORT YOU REMEMBER THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKED ABOUT
GFQvc95oiY8_7 0 AND ACHIEVING A CONVERSATIONAL STYLE CAN BE A LITTLE TRICKY BUT TODAY I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME GREAT TIPS TO HELP YOU WORK IN THAT DIRECTION SO YOU CAN BECOME A PHENOMENAL EXPERT PUBLIC SPEAKER
gbVcRC-jysQ_1 0 NOW WE ARE GOING TO FINISH FOLDING THE BOTTOM OF THE ROSE
gbVcRC-jysQ_2 0 AS YOU CAN SEE HERE WE STARTED WITH A FOLD HERE THAT WAS GOING TO CREASE IT OVER HERE
gbVcRC-jysQ_3 0 WE ARE GOING TO WORK THIS UP JUST A LITTLE BIT SO THE WHITE IS NOT SHOWING NEAR AS MUCH
gbVcRC-jysQ_4 0 THERE WE GO WE WANT THIS TO LOOK VERY PRETTY
gbVcRC-jysQ_5 0 THEN TAKE THIS SIDE AND FOLD IT OVER LIKE SO AND TAKE THIS AND FOLD IT OVER LIKE SO
gbVcRC-jysQ_6 0 NOW AS YOU CAN SEE WE ARE CREATING THE FOLD BASE ON THE INSIDE HERE
gbVcRC-jysQ_7 0 NOW WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TAKE THIS AND JUST FLIP IT IN HERE IT IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT HARD TO DO
gbVcRC-jysQ_8 0 A LITTLE BIT TRICKY
gbVcRC-jysQ_9 0 SO WE HAVE OUR HANDY DANDY CHOPSTICK FOR AND ROLL IT IN THERE
gbVcRC-jysQ_10 0 I'M GOING TO HAVE TO PULL IT OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT THEN SINK IT
gbVcRC-jysQ_11 0 IT IS JUST GOING TO FOLD LIKE A BOX FOLD HERE A LOCKING BOX FOLD HERE
gbVcRC-jysQ_12 0 WORKING ALL THOSE IN TOGETHER
gbVcRC-jysQ_13 0 WE HAVE TO WORK WITH IT AND MAYBE CREASE IT JUST A LITTLE BIT TO GET THIS TO HOLD
gk0EUikQ7tU_1 0 HI TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COPPER FOILING AND WE'RE OVER AT OUR LIGHT TABLE
gk0EUikQ7tU_2 0 I WANT TO TALK TO YOU SPECIFICALLY RIGHT NOW ABOUT YOUR PATTERN
gk0EUikQ7tU_3 0 THERE'S GOING TO BE SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF PATTERNS THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM
gk0EUikQ7tU_4 0 YOU CAN EVEN MAKE YOUR OWN AFTER YOU KNOW HOW TO ALLOW FOR DIFFERENT SEAM ALLOWANCES WITHIN YOUR PATTERN
gk0EUikQ7tU_5 0 I'VE CHOSEN A BUTTERFLY
gk0EUikQ7tU_6 0 WHEN YOU CHOOSE YOUR PATTERN YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE COPY
gk0EUikQ7tU_7 0 GENERALLY YOU WANT TWO COPIES ONE TO USE ON YOUR LIGHT TABLE OR FOR YOUR PATTERN AND THE OTHER ONE TO USE ON YOUR ASSEMBLY BOARD
gk0EUikQ7tU_8 0 THERE ARE TWO WAYS THAT YOU CAN USE YOUR PATTERN TO BENEFIT YOU IN YOUR GLASS CONSTRUCTION
gk0EUikQ7tU_9 0 YOU CAN EITHER LAY YOUR PIECE OF GLASS ON TOP OF YOUR PATTERN THEREBY YOU'RE ABLE TO EITHER OUTLINE AND CUT YOUR PIECE LATER OR YOU CAN JUST CUT IT WITH YOUR TOOL
gk0EUikQ7tU_10 0 THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER WAY ANOTHER PROCESS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LIGHT TABLE
gk0EUikQ7tU_11 0 YOU CAN CUT YOUR PATTERN OUT
gk0EUikQ7tU_12 0 NOW WHEN YOU'RE CUTTING YOUR PATTERN OUT IF IT'S A FOILING PROJECT YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO BE ALL THAT WORRIED ABOUT HAVING SPACING IN BETWEEN YOUR PIECES BUT YOU DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU STAY AS CLOSE ON THE LINE AS POSSIBLE ON THE INSIDE LINE OF EACH PIECE
gk0EUikQ7tU_13 0 SO THERE ARE ALSO PATTERN SHEERS THAT WILL THAT WILL CUT OUT SOME OF THAT LINE FOR YOU BUT STAY AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU GO TO START PUTTING THESE PIECES TOGETHER AND SOLDERING THEM TOGETHER
gk0EUikQ7tU_14 0 YOU DON'T WANT BIG GAPS IN YOUR GLASS
GT_x0WokfBI_1 0 HI THIS IS RICH BUCCOLA HERE IN NEW YORK CITY AND TODAY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE WASABI MASHED POTATOES

GT_x0WokfBI_8 0 I'M GOING TO ADD A TOTAL OF ABOUT A HALF A CUP TO THREE QUARTERS OF A CUP OF HALF-N-HALF
GT_x0WokfBI_9 0 I'M GOING TO START WITH JUST A LITTLE BIT AND I'M GOING TO START USING MY MIXER AND SLOWLY TRY TO GET THIS STARTING TO GET THIS MIXED
GT_x0WokfBI_10 0 I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE IT A LITTLE SPLASH OF THE HEAVY CREAM
GT_x0WokfBI_11 0 I'M ONLY GOING TO PUT MY MIXER ON ONE
GRbJN7Lodu4_1 0 HI MY NAME IS SYLVIA RUSSELL AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO KEEP YOUR HAIR HEALTHY DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS
GRbJN7Lodu4_2 0 SO I'M ON THE BACK OF THE SET AND I'M GETTING MY CLIENT READY FOR HER NEXT SHOOT
GRbJN7Lodu4_3 0 SO WHAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER IS THAT DURING THE SUMMER HAIR CAN BECOME EXPOSED TO A LOT OF SUN
GRbJN7Lodu4_4 0 SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE USE A PROTECTANT ON THE HAIR
GRbJN7Lodu4_5 0 SOME TYPE OF SILK SOME TYPE OF PALMATE SOMETHING THAT IS SPECIFICALLY MADE TO PROTECT THE HAIR DURING STYLING AND SHAMPOOING AND CONDITIONING
GRbJN7Lodu4_6 0 WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALWAYS USE A REALLY GOOD MOISTURIZING SHAMPOO
GRbJN7Lodu4_7 0 THE HAIR WILL BEGIN TO LACK MOISTURE DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS BECAUSE OF THE DRY HEAT AND THE SUN
GRbJN7Lodu4_8 0 SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE REPLENISHING THE HAIR WITH A GOOD CONDITIONER
GRbJN7Lodu4_9 0 REMEMBER TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T USE A LOT OF HEAT ON THE HAIR
GRbJN7Lodu4_10 0 BECAUSE HEAT CAN ALSO DEHYDRATE MAKE YOUR HAIR DRY AND BRITTLE
GRbJN7Lodu4_11 0 SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE STAY AWAY FROM A LOT OF HEAT THAT WE USE A MOISTURIZING CONDITIONER AND THAT WE USE SOME TYPE OF PROTECTANT ON YOUR HAIR THROUGH OUT THE SUMMER MONTHS
GRbJN7Lodu4_12 0 MY NAME IS SYLVIA RUSSELL AND THIS IS HOW TO KEEP YOUR HAIR PROTECTED THROUGH THE SUMMER MONTHS
GWuaQ1FKt1E_1 0 THIS IS AN IMPROV WARM UP CALLED EXAGGERATION CIRCLE
GWuaQ1FKt1E_2 0 THIS IS A GOOD WARM UP TO WORK ON TAKING SOMETHING SMALL AND HEIGHTENING IT
GWuaQ1FKt1E_3 0 BEING ABLE TO REALLY GO BIGGER AND EXPLORE MORE ABOUT ONE SIMPLE IDEA
GWuaQ1FKt1E_4 0 IT'S ALSO GOOD FOR GETTING PEOPLE PHYSICALLY WARMED UP BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO BE MOVING BY THE END OF THIS EXERCISE
GWuaQ1FKt1E_5 0 IT'S ALSO A GOOD WARM UP FOR GETTING PEOPLE TO BE OBSERVANT AND AWARE OF WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING
GWuaQ1FKt1E_6 0 SO HOW IT WORKS IS YOU GET IN A CIRCLE AND YOU START WITH SOME REALLY SMALL MOVEMENTS
GWuaQ1FKt1E_7 0 SO MAYBE I JUST GO LIKE THIS COUGH AND THE NEXT PERSON IN LINE IS GOING TO SLIGHTLY EXAGGERATE THAT MOVEMENT
GWuaQ1FKt1E_8 0 COUGH AND THEN THE NEXT PERSON IS GOING TO EXAGGERATE THAT MOVEMENT COUGH
GWuaQ1FKt1E_9 0 O.K AND IT'S GOING TO GO ON SO ON AND SO FORTH SO BY THE TIME IT GOES ALL THE WAY AROUND THE CIRCLE AND BACK TO ME IT'S GOING HUGE COUGH
GWuaQ1FKt1E_10 0 YOU KNOW AND YOU'VE GOT THIS HUGE EXAGGERATION FROM THIS TINY LITTLE LITTLE OFFER AND IT'S REALLY FUN TO SEE IT SLOWLY BUILD AND MORPH AND BECOME SOMETHING TOTALLY WILD FROM SOMETHING VERY SMALL
GWuaQ1FKt1E_11 0 SO YOU COULD DO SEVERAL ROUNDS OF THAT WHERE DIFFERENT PEOPLE ARE INITIATING SOMETHING VERY LITTLE AND LETTING IT GROW AND CHANGE
GWuaQ1FKt1E_12 0 ANOTHER THING YOU COULD DO IS YOU COULD START WITH SOMETHING REALLY BIG AND LET IT GET SMALLER AND SMALLER AND GO IN THE REVERSE DIRECTION
GWuaQ1FKt1E_13 0 BUT IT'S A SIMPLE GAME ABOUT OBSERVATION AWARENESS AND HEIGHTENING
GWuaQ1FKt1E_14 0 HOW BIG CAN YOU GO WITH A SIMPLE IDEA
GWuaQ1FKt1E_15 0 AND YEAH IT'S JUST CALLED EXAGGERATION CIRCLE
GaK5NlF8CHY_1 0 OK NOW THAT WE HAVE THE HEAD STITCHED AROUND IN THE SHOULDERS WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PUT IN OUR ARMS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE READY AND STUFFED
GaK5NlF8CHY_2 0 AND YOU CAN JUST LEAVE THE RAW EDGES OUT
GaK5NlF8CHY_3 0 JUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO SEW TOO CLOSE TO THEM BECAUSE THEY WILL OTHERWISE YOU WILL HAVE ARMS COME LOOSE
GaK5NlF8CHY_5 0 IF YOU PUT THUMBS ON YOURS WHICH THIS ONE I DIDN'T IF YOU PUT THUMBS ON YOURS BE SURE TO MAKE SURE YOUR THUMBS ARE FACING WHICH WAY YOU WANT
GaK5NlF8CHY_6 0 THEY CAN ACTUALLY EITHER GO UP OR DOWN DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU WANT THEM TO LOOK LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO SIT OR LOOK LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO GET PICKED UP
GaK5NlF8CHY_7 0 GO AHEAD AND PUT THEM IN THERE
GaK5NlF8CHY_8 0 CLOSE IT UP AND PIN IT IN PLACE
GaK5NlF8CHY_9 0 AND WE'LL DO THE SAME THING ON THE OTHER SIDE
GaK5NlF8CHY_10 0 ARMS ARE ROLLING
GaK5NlF8CHY_11 0 AND MAKE SURE THE HAIR IS OUT OF THE WAY
GaK5NlF8CHY_12 0 MAKE SURE THEY ARE ALL THE WAY OUT SO YOU GET NO ARMS COMING OUT
GaK5NlF8CHY_14 0 AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PUT IT UNDER YOUR SEWING MACHINE
GaK5NlF8CHY_15 0 AND LINE UP THE PANTIES SO THAT THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE ABOUT LINED UP WHERE THEY NEED TO BE
GaK5NlF8CHY_16 0 MAKE SURE THAT ARM IS UP WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE
GaK5NlF8CHY_17 0 AND GO TO TOWN
GaK5NlF8CHY_18 0 AT THIS POINT YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND STITCH THE REST OF THE WAY DOWN THE SIDE
GaK5NlF8CHY_19 0 AND THEN YOU WILL DO THE OTHER THING ON OR THE SAME THING ON THE OTHER SIDE
GaK5NlF8CHY_20 0 AND THEN ONCE YOU HAVE THEM BOTH IN YOU TURN IT INSIDE OUT
GaK5NlF8CHY_21 0 I HAVE LIKE THIS
GaK5NlF8CHY_22 0 AND BOTH SIDES SEWED ALL THE WAY DOWN
gupfjA4s7Q4_1 0 MIKE ROSENGART OKAY GUYS SO WE'RE GOING TO COME FROM THE SQUATS AND WE'RE GOING TO COME AND WORK ON SOME PUSH UPS AND WE'VE GOT SOME VARIATIONS FOR THE PUSH UPS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE WARM UP
gupfjA4s7Q4_2 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO HERE JONESY'S GOING TO DO SOME MEDICINE BALL PUSH UPS WHILE RYAN IS GOING TO DO SOME PUSH UPS USING THE KETTLEBELLS JUST TO HELP THE RANGE OF MOTION IN HIS CHEST
gupfjA4s7Q4_3 0 SO GO AHEAD GUYS LET'S GET STARTED
gupfjA4s7Q4_5 0 AGAIN LOOKING TO MAINTAIN THAT FLAT BACK AS YOU'RE WORKING SO YOU GET VERY MUCH CORE ACTIVATION
gupfjA4s7Q4_6 0 WHAT JONESY'S DOING HERE IS THAT HE'S PUSHING THE BALL BACK AND FORTH
gupfjA4s7Q4_7 0 IT HELPS WITH COORDINATION AND MOTOR SKILLS OF THE UPPER BODY AND ALSO HELPS YOU WORK TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO CONTROL YOUR BALANCE IN SPACE AND MOVING DYNAMIC BALANCE
gupfjA4s7Q4_8 0 RYAN'S DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB WITH THE KETTLEBELLS
gupfjA4s7Q4_9 0 THE KETTLEBELLS ARE HARD TO DO PUSH UPS ON BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY UNSTABLE
gupfjA4s7Q4_10 0 THE ROUND BASE CAN REALLY TIP A LOT
gupfjA4s7Q4_11 0 SO HE'S MAKING IT LOOK VERY EASY BUT THEY ARE REALLY HARD
gupfjA4s7Q4_12 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WE'RE GOING TO DO FIFTEEN TO TWENTY OF THESE ALRIGHT
gupfjA4s7Q4_13 0 DEPENDING ON HOW YOU FEEL
gupfjA4s7Q4_14 0 IF YOU FEEL YOU COULD DO TWENTY GO FOR THE TWENTY IF NOT JUST GO FOR THE FIFTEEN AND WE'LL TAKE IT FROM THERE
gupfjA4s7Q4_15 0 REMEMBER YOU WANNA ALWAYS PACE YOURSELF AND SEE HOW YOU FEEL
gupfjA4s7Q4_17 0 AND ALSO IF YOU DON'T HAVE KETTLEBELLS AT HOME YOU ALWAYS COULD TAKE THE DUMBBELLS AND DO THE PUSH UPS ON TOP OF THE DUMBBELLS AND THAT WILL HELP
gupfjA4s7Q4_18 0 THAT WILL HELP THE RANGE OF MOTION OKAY
gupfjA4s7Q4_19 0 SO AFTER THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO ON TO OUR NEXT EXERCISE BUT AGAIN GRAB A SIP OF WATER AND WATCH THE NEXT CLIP
GldiOJgn2T4_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE THIS IS PAUL ANDERSON FROM HOLLYWOOD FLORIDA IN THE ABC CIRCUS
GldiOJgn2T4_2 0 TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU ABOUT CLOWN MAKEUP
GldiOJgn2T4_3 0 SO HARLEQUIN KEEP IT REALLY SIMPLE
GldiOJgn2T4_4 0 BUT YOU NOTICE PURPLE IS NEARLY THE SKIN COLOR NOT TO MUCH DIFFERENT AND IT IS NOT THAT EXCITING
GldiOJgn2T4_5 0 SO I WANT TO ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE
GldiOJgn2T4_6 0 WHITE ALWAYS SETS IT OFF
GldiOJgn2T4_7 0 A LITTLE BIT OF WHITE AROUND MY MOUTH THERE JUST TO SET THAT OFF SO THERE IS MY MOUTH THE PERFECT ARROWS TO MY MOUTH
GldiOJgn2T4_8 0 THEN MAYBE OR UNDERLINE A LIP THERE WE GO
GldiOJgn2T4_9 0 PERHAPS OUTLINE ONE OF THE DIAMOND SHAPES
GldiOJgn2T4_10 0 NOW THESE ARE JUST ROUGH TO GET A IDEA I'M GOING TO CLEAN IT UP IN A FEW MOMENTS SO YOU CAN SEE THE ACTUAL IDEA
GldiOJgn2T4_11 0 BUT YOU SEE THE DIAMOND WITH THE WHITE OUTLINE SHOWS UP A WHOLE LOT MORE WITH THE DIAMOND WITHOUT THE OUTLINE
GldiOJgn2T4_12 0 IT IS ALL ABOUT PUTTING EMPHASIS
GldiOJgn2T4_13 0 PUTTING EMPHASIS ON THE EYES ON THE MOUTH AND BRIGHTEN THE PART OF THE FACE THAT STICK OUT LIKE MY CHEEKS DO
Gwo0VjQbf-0_1 0 NOW THAT WE'VE COMPLETED OUR FIRST ROW
Gwo0VjQbf-0_2 0 AND REMEMBER YOU CAN MAKE THIS SCARF AS WIDE OR AS NARROW AS YOU LIKE
Gwo0VjQbf-0_3 0 NOW THAT WE'VE COMPLETED OUR FIRST ROW WE'RE GOING TO START OUR NEXT ROW SO YOU'RE JUST GOING TO FLIP YOUR PIECE OVER AS WE WORK UP
Gwo0VjQbf-0_4 0 JUST MAKE SURE YOU KEEP A GOOD HOLD ON YOUR YARN AND TO SET THE TONE FOR OR NEXT ROW WE'RE GOING TO CHAIN UP TWO
Gwo0VjQbf-0_5 0 SO THAT'S ONE CHAIN AND THERE'S TWO
Gwo0VjQbf-0_6 0 AND THEN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS REMEMBER TO KEEP OUR OUTSIDES LINED UP STRAIGHT WE HAVE TO DO TWO RIGHT AWAY
Gwo0VjQbf-0_7 0 AND SINCE THERE'S A HOLE RIGHT HERE THIS IS WHERE MY TWO ARE GOING TO GO
Gwo0VjQbf-0_8 0 SO I'M GOING TO WRAP MY YARN AROUND AND JUST GO RIGHT UNDERNEATH THAT WHOLE PIECE RIGHT THERE
Gwo0VjQbf-0_9 0 AND I'VE GOT MY THREE NOW I'LL PULL IT THROUGH THE FIRST TWO AND PULL TO THE SECOND TWO
Gwo0VjQbf-0_10 0 NOW YOU SEE THESE TWO ARE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER BUT AGAIN IT'S JUST TO KEEP OUR OUTSIDES LINED UP
Gwo0VjQbf-0_11 0 AND THEN WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO SKIP OVER THIS ONE SO I'M GOING TO CHAIN ONE AND THEN I'M GOING TO GO RIGHT INTO THIS NEXT HOLE
Gwo0VjQbf-0_12 0 SO I'LL WRAP MY YARN AROUND GO RIGHT UNDERNEATH IT PULL MY YARN THROUGH
Gwo0VjQbf-0_13 0 I'VE GOT MY THREE LOOPS ON MY NEEDLE AND I'M GOING TO PULL MY YARN THROUGH THESE TWO THEN PULL MY YARN THROUGH THESE LAST TWO
Gwo0VjQbf-0_14 0 AND THAT'S HOW WE START OUR SECOND ROW
Gwo0VjQbf-0_15 0 WE SEE WE'VE GOT OUR ALTERNATING HOLES AND CHAINS
Gwo0VjQbf-0_16 0 AND WE'VE GOT OUR LAST TWO PIECES OUTSIDE TO KEEP A NICE CONSISTENT AND STRAIGHT EDGE
gM5hgcDtE_I_1 0 ONE OTHER THING WHEN YOU TALKING ABOUT THE HALF COURT LINE IT COMES ACROSS RIGHT ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE COURT
gM5hgcDtE_I_2 0 WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A HALF COURT LINE YOU WANT TO ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND THAT ONCE YOU CROSS AS A TEAM ANYONE ON THE OFFENSE ONCE YOU CROSS BACK ACROSS THAT LINE ONCE YOU CROSS THAT LINE YOU CAN NOT CROSS BACK
gM5hgcDtE_I_3 0 THAT IS CALLED BACK COURT VIOLATION
gM5hgcDtE_I_4 0 NOW WHEN YOU ARE FIRST TAKING THE BALL OUT YOU WANT TO YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO CROSS THE HALF COURT LINE BEFORE EIGHT TO TEN SECONDS
gM5hgcDtE_I_5 0 IT USED TO BE TEN SECONDS IN MY DAY WHEN I PLAYED BUT I HAVE SEEN WHERE THEY HAVE COUNTED EIGHT SO YOU WANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND WHENEVER YOU ARE PLAYING BALL THAT YOU GOT TO CROSS THAT HALF COURT LINE AND YOU CAN NEVER CAN NEVER PASS IT BACK ACROSS THAT LINE ONCE YOU HAVE CROSSED OVER INTO THE OFFENSE THE FRONT COURT
gM5hgcDtE_I_6 0 THAT IS JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED TO KEEP IN MIND WHENEVER YOU ARE PLAYING RIGHT AROUND THAT HALF COURT LINE
gM5hgcDtE_I_7 0 KEEPING IN MIND THAT YOU GUYS WILL ALWAYS ALWAYS BE WITHIN THE REGULATIONS IF YOU KEEP THESE RULES EACH OF THESE RULES I AM TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW IN MIND WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING BASKETBALL
GsuJmmXU5Qc_1 0 NOW WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS WHAT VACCINATIONS CATS NEED
GsuJmmXU5Qc_2 0 EVERY STATE REQUIRES DIFFERENT VACCINATIONS AND RABIES VACCINATIONS AT DIFFERENT INTERVALS SO CHECK WITH YOUR STATE AS FAR AS RABIES VACCINATION IS CONCERNED
GsuJmmXU5Qc_3 0 A VACCINATION IS PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS DOING IS BUILDING IMMUNITY OF THE CAT'S BODY TOWARD VIRAL INFECTIONS
GsuJmmXU5Qc_4 0 THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF VACCINATIONS THAT WE USE ESPECIALLY FOR OUTDOOR CATS
GsuJmmXU5Qc_5 0 THE FIRST WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT IS RABIES VACCINATION AND RABIES VACCINATION IS TO PREVENT THE VIRAL INFECTION FROM RABIES THAT IS GENERALLY SEEN IN THE WILD CAT POPULATION AND THE WILD LIFE POPULATION SUCH AS RACCOONS AND SKUNKS BATS THINGS LIKE THAT
GsuJmmXU5Qc_6 0 RABIES VACCINATION DOES VARY FROM STATE TO STATE AS FAR AS HOW OFTEN THEY HAVE TO RECEIVE THAT
GsuJmmXU5Qc_7 0 THESE VACCINATIONS ARE GIVEN UNDER THE SKIN GENERALLY ONCE A YEAR AND ARE VERY EFFECTIVE AT PREVENTING RABIES
GsuJmmXU5Qc_8 0 ANOTHER VACCINATION THAT WE GIVE TO CATS DEPENDING ON THEIR AGE AND IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE INDOOR/OUTDOOR IS DISTEMPER WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY AN EASY TERM OF UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS IN CATS
GsuJmmXU5Qc_9 0 THIS IS WHAT PREVENTS THAT
GsuJmmXU5Qc_10 0 THIS IS RHINOTRACHEITIS CASEY AND PANLEUKOPENIA
GsuJmmXU5Qc_11 0 THOSE ARE THREE DIFFERENT VIRUSES THAT CATS GET AND CAN GET THAT CAN BE DEVASTATING TO THEM SO THIS IS A GREAT PREVENTION TO KEEP YOUR CATS HEALTHY AND TO RENT THOSE DISEASES
GsuJmmXU5Qc_12 0 THE THIRD ONE THAT WE VERY COMMONLY GIVE ESPECIALLY TO OUTDOOR CATS IS THE FELINE LEUKEMIA VACCINE
GsuJmmXU5Qc_13 0 FELINE LEUKEMIA IS A VIRUS THAT CAN BE CONTRACTED THROUGH BITE WOUNDS FIGHTS AND SEXUAL BEHAVIOR
GsuJmmXU5Qc_14 0 ESSENTIALLY THIS TYPE OF VIRUS IS ONE OF THOSE THAT CAN BE DEADLY IF THEY CONTRACT IT
GsuJmmXU5Qc_15 0 THEY CAN CONTRACT IT AND HAVE IT FOR A WHILE AND THEY CAN GIVE THIS TO OTHER CATS AND THEN EVENTUALLY THEY CAN SUCCUMB TO THE DISEASE
GsuJmmXU5Qc_16 0 RABIES VACCINATION IS TO PREVENT RABIES WHICH AGAIN IS SEEN IN THE WILDLIFE POPULATION MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND THAT IS A FATAL DISEASE BUT IT CAN BE VERY VERY WELL PREVENTED
GsuJmmXU5Qc_17 0 ALL THESE VACCINES ARE GENERALLY DRAWN UP AND ARE LIQUID FORM AND ARE GIVEN UNDER THE SKIN DEPENDING ON HOW OFTEN THAT CAN BE ONCE A YEAR TO EVERY THREE YEARS
GsuJmmXU5Qc_18 0 ALSO WHEN THEY ARE KITTENS THEY HAVE TO BE BOOSTED GENERALLY ONE VACCINE FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER ONE TWO TO THREE WEEKS LATER AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED BY A THIRD ONE DEPENDING ON WHICH VACCINE IS USED
gQJlTBo6E6s_2 0 MY NAME IS NATURAL AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE TO DISCUSS HOW TO SURVIVE IN PRISON
gQJlTBo6E6s_3 0 SO FORWARD MOVING BEING PROGRESSIVE WITH YOUR LIFE
gQJlTBo6E6s_4 0 THEY DO OFFER GED CLASSES AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET YOUR GED
gQJlTBo6E6s_5 0 THEY OFFER COLLEGE COURSES IN MANY OF THE PRISON INSTITUTIONS AND THERE ARE CERTAIN QUALIFICATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN GET INTO THOSE PROGRAMS
gQJlTBo6E6s_6 0 IF YOU DON'T MEET THOSE QUALIFICATIONS THERE IS PLENTY OF EDUCATION OUTSIDE OF THAT
gQJlTBo6E6s_7 0 I KNOW THAT WHEN I WAS INCARCERATED I WAS ABLE TO TAKE AN AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE COURSE
gQJlTBo6E6s_8 0 I TOOK A CROCHETING CLASS
gQJlTBo6E6s_9 0 I ALSO TOOK A SMOKING SESSION CLASS AND A BREATHING AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUE CLASS
gQJlTBo6E6s_10 0 YOU GET CERTIFICATES FOR ALL OF THESE CLASSES
gQJlTBo6E6s_11 0 IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE AN INDIVIDUAL THAT IS TRYING TO BE PAROLED OR LOOKING FOR SOME SORT OF CONDITIONAL RELEASE ALL OF THESE THINGS CAN BENEFIT YOU
gQJlTBo6E6s_12 0 THEY SHOW THAT THE SYSTEM ITSELF THAT YOU ARE BASICALLY TRYING TO MAKE A CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD AND NOT CONTINUE IN THE LIFESTYLE THAT MAY HAVE LANDED YOU IN PRISON TO BEGIN WITH
gQJlTBo6E6s_13 0 BUT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM THERE IS IMPERATIVE TO BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF
gQJlTBo6E6s_14 0 IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SURVIVE GENERALLY SURVIVE THE PRISON EXPERIENCE YOU CAN CONTINUE TO EDUCATE YOURSELF
gQJlTBo6E6s_15 0 I THINK THAT THAT IS VERY NECESSARY
g7L0oqiclpY_1 0 ALRIGHT SO IT'S NOT GOING TO COMPLETELY FOLLOW AROUND AS IF IT WERE GOING COMPLETELY ALONG WITH THE CIRCULAR DIAGRAM SO I THINK YOU CAN SEE MY POINT BEST IN THIS LITTLE DIAGRAM
g7L0oqiclpY_2 0 AND ALSO YOU WANT TO BE SURE THAT THIS ENDS UP IN A PLACE THAT MAKES SENSE THIS ONE BEING A SMALLER CIRCLE IF YOU IMAGINE DOT DOT DOT DOT DOT DOT AND IT ENDS UP HERE NOT WAY OUT HERE BUT THERE AND THIS ONE IS GOING TO END UP OUT A LITTLE FURTHER THAN THAT
g7L0oqiclpY_3 0 ALRIGHT SO THIS IS A SLIGHTLY NICELY BETTER DRAWN S
g7L0oqiclpY_4 0 WHAT DO WE HAVE FOR S
g7L0oqiclpY_5 0 OOH OKAY SLOW DOWN OKAY
g7L0oqiclpY_6 0 THERE'S NO WAY TO GET A BEAUTIFUL LETTER ONTO THE PAGE ESPECIALLY IN THE BEGINNING IF YOU DON'T GO SLOWLY
g7L0oqiclpY_7 0 SENSUAL THERE IS A SENSUAL NATURE TO CALLIGRAPHY THE SAME AS THERE IS A SENSUAL NATURE TO DANCE
g7L0oqiclpY_8 0 YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THEY CALL CALLIGRAPHY THE DANCE OF THE PEN
g7L0oqiclpY_9 0 IF IT WERE NOT SENSUAL IT WOULD NOT BE WORKING OR THE SHAPES OF THE LETTERS AND THE WAY YOU FORM THE LETTERS WOULD NOT BE WORKING WITH THE WAY WE ARE DESIGNED AS PEOPLE AS HUMAN BEINGS SO YES IT HAS A SENSUAL NATURE YES IT TAKES SKILL AND THE STUDYING OF THE SKILL HAS TO COME FIRST
g7L0oqiclpY_10 0 FIRST YOU GET THE SKILL AND THEN YOU GET THE CREATIVITY
g7L0oqiclpY_11 0 SPACING OF COURSE IS A HUGE HUGE THING
g7L0oqiclpY_12 0 WE'VE TALKED ABOUT NEGATIVE SPACE NEGATIVE SPACE AND POSITIVE NEGATIVE SPACE
g7L0oqiclpY_13 0 SO YOUR SPACING IS VERY IMPORTANT
g7L0oqiclpY_14 0 AND WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT SPACING AS TIME GOES ON
g7L0oqiclpY_15 0 BUT RIGHT NOW LETS STICK WITH THE IDEAS OF THE MODELS GETTING OUR BASIC STUFF DOWN
GREqGUpzceA_1 0 HI MY NAME IS CHRIS LATHAM AND WE'RE HERE TODAY AT EMI MUSIC PUBLISHING'S NASHVILLE RECORDING STUDIO ON MUSIC ROW WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
GREqGUpzceA_2 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE YOUR VOCAL PERFORMANCE

GREqGUpzceA_9 0 I CAN FIX TUNING I CAN FIX TIMING
GREqGUpzceA_10 0 I CAN'T FIX EMOTION I CAN'T FIX TONE SO YOU NEED TO SHOW UP KNOWING THE SONG WELL ENOUGH TO WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ THE LYRICS WHERE YOU CAN FEEL IT WHERE YOU CAN EMOTE AND GIVE A PERFORMANCE THAT'S GOING TO BE MOVING TO YOU AND EVERYBODY ELSE THAT WILL HEAR IT
GREqGUpzceA_11 0 GENERALLY THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO DO THIS IS YOU'RE GOING TO SING THREE TO FIVE VOCAL PASSES MEANING A PERFORMANCE OF THE WHOLE SONG
GREqGUpzceA_12 0 ON THE FIRST PASS WE'LL GO THROUGH AND FIX A FEW THINGS THAT OBVIOUSLY NEED FIXING JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THE SONG AND GET A GREAT PERFORMANCE THEN WE'LL SAVE THAT ONE
GREqGUpzceA_13 0 WE'LL GET ANOTHER PASS OF THE WHOLE SONG YOU SINGING IT THROUGH THEN MAYBE ONE TO TWO MORE PASSES BEYOND THAT
GREqGUpzceA_14 0 THAT WAY WE HAVE SOME OPTIONS
GREqGUpzceA_15 0 AND THEN WE'LL COMP OR COMPILE THE VOCAL MEANING WE'RE GOING TO TAKE LINES THE BEST LINES FROM EACH PASS THAT WE'VE SAVED AND PUT TOGETHER A REALLY SOLID VOCAL PERFORMANCE FROM BEGINNING TO END

gpOq4ilCxqo_1 0 HI I'M TIM COLE AT AUSTIN REPTILE SERVICE AND I'VE BEEN KEEPING REPTILES AMPHIBIANS FOR OVER FORTY YEARS AND WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT TURTLE DIETS
gpOq4ilCxqo_2 0 MOST OF YOUR TORTOISES AND BOX TURTLES ARE HERBIVORES AND THEY WILL FEED ON DIFFERENT SALAD MIXES
gpOq4ilCxqo_3 0 SO WE HAVE A VARIETY OF LEAFY GREENS
gpOq4ilCxqo_4 0 WE'VE GOT KALE AND CARROTS AND ROMAINE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF SPINACH A LITTLE BIT OF CABBAGE NOT TOO MUCH
gpOq4ilCxqo_5 0 THESE ARE FOR TORTOISES
gpOq4ilCxqo_6 0 AND ANOTHER THING THAT A LOT OF THE TORTOISES ARE GOING TO EAT ARE DIFFERENT GRASSES
gpOq4ilCxqo_7 0 NOW OF COURSE HAVING NATIVE GRASSES OUTSIDE IS THE BEST WAY TO FEED THEM BUT YOU HAVE TO DO A BACK UP TO DO A BACKUP SOURCE IN THE HOUSE THIS BERMUDA GRASS WORKS OUT VERY WELL FOR TORTOISES
gpOq4ilCxqo_8 0 AND THEN FOR OUR WATER TURTLES SOME OF THEM WILL EAT FISH BUT A LOT OF THEM WILL EAT TURTLE PELLETS
gpOq4ilCxqo_9 0 THIS IS ONE OF THE BRANDS CALLED REPTOMIN
gpOq4ilCxqo_10 0 THERE'S ANOTHER BRAND CALLED MISSOURI THAT WORKS VERY GOOD
gpOq4ilCxqo_11 0 MISSOURI MAKES AQUATIC FOODS THEY MAKE TORTOISE FOODS AND THE MISSOURI BRANDS ARE VERY GOOD FOODS FOR TURTLES
gpOq4ilCxqo_12 0 A LOT OF YOUR LAND TURTLES LIKE YOUR BOX TURTLES WILL EAT EARTHWORMS AND CRICKETS
gpOq4ilCxqo_13 0 SO YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM A VARIETY
gpOq4ilCxqo_14 0 DO A LOT OF RESEARCH ON WHAT YOUR TURTLES EAT AND GIVE THEM VARIETY DON'T JUST STICK WITH ONE THING
gpOq4ilCxqo_15 0 BUT FEEDING TURTLES CAN BE WORK
gzlkFlmvqqo_1 0 OKAY NOW THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IT IS THE MAKE OR BREAK
gzlkFlmvqqo_2 0 YOU TAKE ALL THESE STUFF THAT YOU HAVE SHOVED ON TOP OF YOUR RICE AND THEN YOU WANT TO USE THE SUSHI ROLLER TO LIFT IT UP AND COLLAPSE IT ONTO ITSELF
gzlkFlmvqqo_3 0 SO I'M USING MY FINGERS HERE KEEPING THE SUSHI ROLLER NICE AND DRY AND CLEAN
gzlkFlmvqqo_4 0 I'M USING MY FINGERS HERE AND I'M GOING TO TURN THIS WAY TO ENCLOSE ALL THE STUFF IN THE RICE BRING IT AROUND AND SEAL IT
gzlkFlmvqqo_5 0 NOW WHEN YOU ARE IN THE SUSHI ROLLER YOU CAN REALLY SQUEEZE IT HARD AND ALL THE GLUTEN AND THE OILS SHOULD BE SPILLING OUT PUTTING A NICE SEAL FOR OUR ROLL
gzlkFlmvqqo_6 0 THAT IS GOOD WE HAD A LITTLE BREAK BUT THAT IS OKAY AND THAT IS OUR ROLL
gzlkFlmvqqo_7 0 NOW IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A GIANT PLATE OF THESE WHICH I RECOMMEND YOU DO IF YOU ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS TROUBLE FIVE OR SIX OF THESE AND THEN I DEMONSTRATE HOW TO CUT THEM UP
gsjYWGJxIGQ_1 0 HI MY NAME IS JESSICA MEICZINGER WITH SIMPLY DIVINE EVENTS AND TODAY I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO INCORPORATE YOUR ESCORT CARDS AND PLACE CARDS INTO YOUR GARDEN THEMED WEDDING
gsjYWGJxIGQ_2 0 FIRST OF ALL WE CAN IF YOU WANT SOMETHING EDIBLE YOU CAN ALWAYS HAVE YOUR YOU KNOW COOKIES MADE IN THE SHAPES OF FLOWERS OR JUST A SIMPLE COOKIE WITH THE BRIDE AND GROOM'S MONOGRAM ON THAT AND ATTACH A LITTLE TAG WITH THE GUESTS NAME AND TABLE ASSIGNMENT AND JUST PLACE THOSE EITHER AT THE PLACE SETTING OR ON YOUR ESCORT CARD TABLE
gsjYWGJxIGQ_3 0 ANOTHER IDEA IS TO JUST FIND IF YOU'RE MORE INTO THE SHABBY CHIC LOOK YOU CAN GO WITH DIFFERENT TRAYS OR CAKE STANDS
gsjYWGJxIGQ_4 0 SILVER TRAYS ARE NICE AND YOU CAN LINE THEM WITH FLOWERS FLOWER BUDS FLOWER PETALS AND JUST DO YOUR TRADITIONAL TENT CARDS
gsjYWGJxIGQ_5 0 YOU CAN ADORN THE TENT CARDS THE ESCORT CARDS WITH A LITTLE PRESSED FLOWER IF YOU WANT TO DRESS IT UP A LITTLE BIT
gsjYWGJxIGQ_6 0 THOSE ARE JUST SOME FUN OPTIONS
gsjYWGJxIGQ_7 0 YOU CAN ALSO JUST HAVE THE CARDS ON THE TABLE AND LINE EACH ROW WITH ROSE PETALS WHICH IS A NICE TOUCH AS WELL
gsjYWGJxIGQ_8 0 ANOTHER CUTE IDEA IS TAKE YOUR SEED PACKET AND ATTACH A LITTLE CARD WITH THE GUEST'S NAME AND TABLE ASSIGNMENT ON THAT AND YOU CAN USE THOSE AT THE PLACE SETTING AS PLACE CARDS OR AGAIN ON LIKE A FAVOR TABLE YOU CAN SET THEM IN BASKETS OR NICE LITTLE TRAYS
gsjYWGJxIGQ_9 0 ANOTHER IDEA ONE OF MY FAVORITES IS TO GET THE MINIATURE WATERING CANS AND FILL THEM WITH GOODIES WHETHER IT BE SOME CANDIES OR SOME DRIED FRUITS OR SOMETHING AND YOU CAN USE THOSE
gsjYWGJxIGQ_10 0 IT'S A NICE LITTLE KEEPSAKE FAVOR AS WELL AS YOUR ESCORT CARD
gsjYWGJxIGQ_11 0 IF YOU'RE DOING POTTED PLANTS OR LIKE AS YOUR CENTERPIECES YOU CAN DO MINIATURE POTTED PLANTS IN TERRA COTTA POTS AND WRITE THE GUEST'S NAME AND TABLE ASSIGNMENT ON THOSE AS WELL
gsjYWGJxIGQ_12 0 SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME IDEAS ON HOW TO INCORPORATE YOUR GARDEN THEME INTO YOUR ESCORT CARD OR PLACE CARDS
h0G7LTshPus_1 0 THE WASP MODULE HAS ITS OWN FILTER
h0G7LTshPus_2 0 THE FILTER IS USUALLY LIKE IT IS LIKE A LOT OF THE OTHER USUAL FILTERS
h0G7LTshPus_3 0 EXCEPT THAT IT ACTUALLY HAS MORE POSSIBLE PARAMETERS FOR THE FILTER TYPE
h0G7LTshPus_4 0 THE THREE BASIC FILTER TYPES AS WE DISCUSSED IN THE EFFECTS IN PREVIOUS SERIES ARE LP BP AND HP
h0G7LTshPus_5 0 LP STANDS FOR LOW PASS
h0G7LTshPus_6 0 BP STANDS FOR BAND PASS
h0G7LTshPus_7 0 AND HP STANDS FOR HIGH PASS
h0G7LTshPus_8 0 NOW YOU SEE THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY THREE OTHER KINDS HERE
h0G7LTshPus_9 0 WE HAVE DBL NOTCH LP NOTCH AND LP FAT
h0G7LTshPus_10 0 FAT DOES NOT ACTUALLY STAND FOR ANYTHING
h0G7LTshPus_11 0 IT LITERALLY JUST MEANS FAT
h0G7LTshPus_12 0 BECAUSE IT REALLY FATTENS THE SOUND
h0G7LTshPus_13 0 LIKE IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAVE WHEN YOU HAVE FAT ON IT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE IT IS ACTUALLY BEING STRETCHED OUT
h0G7LTshPus_15 0 GIVING IT MORE AMPLITUDE
h0G7LTshPus_16 0 MAKING IT SOUND LOUDER BUT ALSO CHANGING THE CHARACTER OF THE SOUND ITSELF
h0G7LTshPus_17 0 NOTCH IS LIKE AN INVERSE BAND PASS
h0G7LTshPus_18 0 AND DBL NOTCH IS LIKE A NOTCH COMBINING L PASS AND B BAND PASS
h0G7LTshPus_19 0 LIKE EVERY OTHER FILTER IS CONTROLLED BY THE CUTOFF AND RESONANCE IT ALSO HAS A LITTLE LIGHT HERE YOU CAN CHECK TO LINK THE CUTOFF AND RESONANCE
h0G7LTshPus_20 0 SO THAT WHEN YOU MOVE IT THE RESONANCE MOVES WITH THE CUTOFF
h0G7LTshPus_21 0 GIVING YOU A DECENT FREQUENCY EVERY TIME YOU MOVE IT
h0G7LTshPus_22 0 IT ALSO HAS ENVELOPE WHICH TELLS YOU HOW MUCH THIS ENVELOPE IS AFFECTING THE FILTER
h0G7LTshPus_23 0 THAT IS THE BASIC FILTER OF THE WASP
h0G7LTshPus_24 0 IT IS PRETTY EASY TO GET YOUR HEAD AROUND
h0G7LTshPus_25 0 IT IS REALLY USEFUL FOR MAKING MORE AMBIENT SOUNDS WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR CUTOFF ALL THE WAY OFF
h0G7LTshPus_26 0 OR ALL THE WAY UP DEPENDING ON IF YOU HAVE LOW PASS OR HIGH PASS
h0G7LTshPus_27 0 AND YOU CAN AGAIN USE IT TO CREATE REAL UNIQUE AND INDIVIDUAL NOISES
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_1 0 YOU WANT TO REST
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_2 0 YOU WANT TO TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_3 0 NO NOT YET
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_4 0 NO WE NEED TO DO THE CALF
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_5 0 THAT'S THE END OF IT OKAY
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_6 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO WORK A LITTLE BIT WITH THIS MY CALF WHAT I'M TRYING TO HAVE ALL THE TIME IS MY CALF MOVING UP AND DOWN YEAH BRINGING ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND BRING IT HIGH AS YOU CAN
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_7 0 SO MY BODY I'M GOING TO KEEP IT FORWARD YEAH BE CAREFUL WITH MY LOW BACK WITH MY STOMACH DON'T BEND IT OR DON'T PULL OUT
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_8 0 YES TRY TO KEEP IT IN
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_9 0 AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS JUST TRY TO BRING MY HEELS HIGH AS YOU CAN
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_10 0 NOW THIS IS ONE PART THAT YOU CAN USE IT AND YOU JUST BRING IT UP AND DOWN YEAH
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_11 0 IF NOT DO THE SAME THING YEAH AND DO IT MORE SIDE BE CAREFUL
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_12 0 ALWAYS BE CAREFUL
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_13 0 REMEMBER SAFETY FIRST
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_14 0 YEAH THIS IS ONE SIDE THAT YOU CAN USE
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_16 0 NOW IF YOU KNOW THIS EXERCISE AND YOU HAVE DONE IT BEFORE YEAH IS ONE ALL THE WAY UP AND DO IT ALL THE WAY DOWN
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_17 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO BRING MY BODY ALL THE WAY DOWN WATCH YES AND WITH MY HEELS ALL THE WAY AS HIGH AS YOU CAN
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_18 0 AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS YOU HAVE TO BRING IT DOWN AND UP
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_20 0 DOWN AND UP
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_21 0 SO WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE IS YOU'RE BRINGING ALL THE WEIGHT OF YOUR BODY AND YOU'RE CARRYING IT UP AND DOWN
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_23 0 THAT GOES IN SPECIFIC AND IT'S STRENGTHEN OF YOUR INSIDE AND YOUR ALL TIE OF YOUR CALF
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_24 0 YEAH THERE'S NO WAY
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_25 0 REMEMBER FOUR SETS OF TEN REPS THAT WILL BE THE BEST
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_26 0 AND THEN STRETCH IT UP
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_28 0 THIS ONE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE MUSCLE YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THEM ANOTHER QUICK AS POSSIBLE TO GET IT LESS REST
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_30 0 SO BRING IT DOWN AND WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE MORE TIME
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_31 0 UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN ALL THE WEIGHT IT GOES STRAIGHT TO YOUR KNEES TOO OKAY
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_32 0 SO BRINGING ALL YOUR WEIGHT
HJ4S2dQ4IbI_34 0 NOW IN THE NEXT CLIP I WILL SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT THE RESISTANT FEET EXERCISE
Hai5VmQsXhU_1 0 I'M JK DOOLEY I'M A PROFESSIONAL ARTIST AND WE'RE TALKING TODAY ABOUT GICLEE REPRODUCTIONS
Hai5VmQsXhU_2 0 AND NOW WE'RE TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CANVAS AND PRINTING ON CANVAS
Hai5VmQsXhU_3 0 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'LL RUN INTO WHEN YOU PRINT ON CANVAS IS THE PIECE THAT YOU RECEIVE WILL NOT BE A FINISHED PIECE UNLIKE PAPER THAT YOU PRETTY MUCH CAN PUT IN A LITTLE ENVELOPE AND SELL
Hai5VmQsXhU_4 0 A CANVAS PIECE TYPICALLY IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE STRETCHED AND THAT'S ANOTHER STEP THAT'S INVOLVED AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE LATER
Hai5VmQsXhU_5 0 BUT WHAT IT INVOLVES WHAT IT BASICALLY MEANS IS YOU TAKE A PIECE OF CANVAS LIKE THIS AND THROUGH A PROCESS THAT REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT OF WORK YOU END UP WITH A PRODUCT LIKE THIS WHERE IT'S BASICALLY WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENED IS THE CANVAS IS WRAPPED AROUND SOME PIECES OF WOOD STRETCHER BARS AND SECURED IN THE BACK
Hai5VmQsXhU_6 0 AND IT BASICALLY IS READY TO HANG AT THAT POINT OR BE FRAMED
Hai5VmQsXhU_7 0 SO THAT'S WHAT STRETCHING MEANS AND IT'S A LITTLE INVOLVED IT'S NOT A DIFFICULT PROCESS AND IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING YOU CAN DO YOURSELF OR YOU CAN PAY SOMEONE TO DO FOR YOU
Hai5VmQsXhU_8 0 SO THAT'S WHAT STRETCHING CANVAS MEANS
gRndDi4ebtA_1 0 MY NAME IS JILL WEISS AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO BUY A SOFTBALL BAT
gRndDi4ebtA_2 0 FIRST THING IS IS YOU WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU ARE MOST LIKELY GOING TO SPEND BETWEEN FIFTY DOLLARS AND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
gRndDi4ebtA_3 0 JUST KIND OF DEPENDS ON HOW SERIOUS YOU ARE
gRndDi4ebtA_4 0 YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF ATHLETE YOUR YOUR CHILD OR OR IS IS GOING FOR
gRndDi4ebtA_5 0 MAIN THING IS IS THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOU KNOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF BATS
gRndDi4ebtA_6 0 YOU CAN DO THE MORE BOTTLED BOTTLED BAT IS WHAT THEY KIND OF CALL IT OR MORE OF AN END-LOADED BAT
gRndDi4ebtA_7 0 AS FAR AS AN END-LOADED BAT GOES YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF JUST EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS
gRndDi4ebtA_8 0 THE MOST OF THE POWER IS IN THE END OF THE BAT
gRndDi4ebtA_9 0 A BOTTLE BAT IT HAS A LARGER SWEET SPOT BUT IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T PRODUCE AS MUCH POWER AS AN END LOADED BAT
gRndDi4ebtA_10 0 FOR A YOUNGER ATHLETE THE WAY TO TEST IT AS FAR AS SIZE GOES AND WEIGHT IS YOU WANT TO HAVE EM HOLD IT WITH THEIR THEIR BOTTOM THEIR DOMINANT HAND MAYBE CHOKE UP ABOUT AN INCH AND THEY AND AND THEN HOLD IT OUT AND THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIRMLY GRIP IT AND AND HOLD IT WITHOUT YOU KNOW WITHOUT IT SHAKING
gRndDi4ebtA_11 0 IF IT'S TOO HEAVY FOR THE ATHLETE YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY CAN'T HOLD IT THEY CAN'T BALANCE IT
gRndDi4ebtA_12 0 SO THAT'S ONE WAY TO BE ABLE TO TELL IF IF THE WEIGHT OF THE BAT IS TOO HEAVY OR YOU KNOW IF IT FITS
gRndDi4ebtA_13 0 AS FAR AS SIZE GOES YOU KNOW IT RANGES ANYWHERE FROM THE LENGTH BEING REAL YOUNG TWENTY-SEVEN TWENTY-EIGHT INCHES TO ALL THE WAY TO THIRTY FOUR
gRndDi4ebtA_14 0 OBVIOUSLY TALLER TALLER GIRLS USUALLY USE THE LONGER BATS
gRndDi4ebtA_15 0 SLAPPERS IF YOU'RE YOU KNOW ON THE LEFT SIDE OR OR IF YOU'RE TRYING TO REACH THAT OUTSIDE PITCH YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO USE THIS A LONGER BAT A THIRTY-THREE INCH OR EVEN A THIRTY-FOUR INCH
gRndDi4ebtA_16 0 THERE'S DIFFERENT BRANDS
gRndDi4ebtA_17 0 THE MAIN THING YOU WOULD WANT TO DO IS JUST ASKING COACHES ASKING DIFFERENT YOU KNOW SALES REPS ON ON THE DIFFERENT BRANDS
gRndDi4ebtA_18 0 SO THAT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU KNOW GOING GOING ABOUT BUYING A BAT
gRndDi4ebtA_19 0 MY NAME IS JILL WEISS AND THAT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BUYING A BAT
gJaSUi21rrI_1 0 HI THIS IS JON AND IN THIS CLIP WE WILL BE INSTALLING THE CLOSERS
gJaSUi21rrI_2 0 NOW FOR OUR TOP CLOSER WE'RE GOING TO WANT IT INSTALLED ABOUT A QUARTER INCH IN FROM OUR DOOR FRAME
gJaSUi21rrI_3 0 NOW YOU WANT TO INSTALL YOUR DOOR BRACKETS ABOUT ONE INCH DOWN FROM THE TOP OF YOUR DOOR
gJaSUi21rrI_4 0 THE NEXT THING YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS DRY-FIT YOUR COMPONENTS IN PLACE FOR WHERE THEY SHOULD GO AND THEN MAKE A COUPLE OF MARKS WITH A MARKER TO TELL YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO DRILL FOR YOUR SCREWS
gJaSUi21rrI_5 0 ONCE YOU GET YOUR TOP CLOSER INSTALLED PROPERLY YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TEST IT AND START ON THE BOTTOM ONE
gJaSUi21rrI_6 0 NOW WHEN INSTALLING THE BOTTOM CLOSER IT WILL BE INSTALLED WITH THE SAME MEASUREMENTS AND IN THE SAME PROCEDURES AS OUR TOP CLOSER
gJaSUi21rrI_7 0 AND LASTLY WE JUST AGAIN WANT TO TEST OUR DOOR TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR HINGES ARE WORKING PROPERLY
gJaSUi21rrI_8 0 IT'S ALRIGHT IF IT DOESN'T FULLY CLOSE AT THIS POINT BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO ADJUST THE TENSIONING IN A LITTLE BIT
GPN8BxTQeBw_1 0 IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO DISCUSS XLR CABLES
GPN8BxTQeBw_2 0 XLR CABLES PRIMARILY ARE USED FOR MICROPHONES
GPN8BxTQeBw_3 0 BUT THEY COULD BE IMPORTANT AS A GUITAR PLAYER IF YOU'RE PLAYING AN ACOUSTIC GIG AND YOU WOULD NEED TO AMPLIFY YOUR GUITAR IF IT DIDN'T HAVE A PLUG ON IT
GPN8BxTQeBw_4 0 NOW IT LOOKS SIMILAR TO AN INSTRUMENT CABLE IN IT'S CONSTRUCTION HOWEVER THE PLUGS ARE DIFFERENT
GPN8BxTQeBw_5 0 THE THING YOU'LL SEE HERE THERE'S THREE PRONGS ON ONE END
GPN8BxTQeBw_6 0 THIS WOULD BE THE MALE END
GPN8BxTQeBw_7 0 AND THE FEMALE END YOU'LL SEE THAT'S WHERE THERE'S HOLES INSTEAD OF PLUGS
GPN8BxTQeBw_8 0 NOW THIS CABLE DIFFERS FROM AN INSTRUMENT CABLE IN THAT IT DOES MATTER WHICH END YOU USE
GPN8BxTQeBw_9 0 FOR EXAMPLE IF I TAKE A MICROPHONE HERE YOU'LL NOTICE THAT A MICROPHONE HAS THE THREE PLUGS ON IT
GPN8BxTQeBw_10 0 YOU WOULD NEED TO USE THE FEMALE END TO PLUG INTO THE MIC AND THEN THE MALE END WOULD GO INTO THE AMPLIFIER

g_LPgfiX7Ik_1 0 OKAY FOLKS IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE A LIVING AS AN ARTIST
g_LPgfiX7Ik_2 0 UNLIKE SOME PROFESSIONS THERE ARE LITERALLY DOZENS AND DOZENS OF WAYS THAT YOU CAN MAKE A LIVING AS AN ARTIST
g_LPgfiX7Ik_3 0 IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO SKETCH DRAW PAINT DESIGN YOU HAVE MANY MANY OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU
g_LPgfiX7Ik_4 0 ONE AROUND YOU COULD GO INTO IS GRAPHIC DESIGN
g_LPgfiX7Ik_5 0 THESE DAYS A LOT OF THAT'S DONE ON COMPUTER NOT AS MUCH FREEHAND ANYMORE BUT USING COMPUTERS HAS REALLY OPENED UP AN ARTIST'S WORLD IN GIVING US YET ANOTHER TOOL WITH WHICH TO CREATE AND SO A LOT OF PEOPLE LEAN IN THAT DIRECTION
g_LPgfiX7Ik_6 0 IF YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY INCLINED AND DON'T LIKE TO GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY QUITE AS MUCH THAT MIGHT BE A REALLY GOOD OPTION FOR YOU
g_LPgfiX7Ik_7 0 THERE'S A LOT OF CREATIVITY AND A LOT OF VERSATILITY IN THAT THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY OF JOBS FOR DESIGNERS
g_LPgfiX7Ik_8 0 ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE A LIVING AS AN ARTIST WOULD BE TO BECOME A GRAPHIC NOVEL ARTIST OR AN ANIMATOR MAYBE
g_LPgfiX7Ik_9 0 THESE ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT FROM GRAPHIC DESIGN OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO HAVE A BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF DIMENSIONS SHAPES IN TERMS OF THE HUMAN FORM AND ALSO MOVEMENT THAT'S THE KEY AS WELL TO CREATE PANELS IN A COMIC STRIP OR ESPECIALLY TO CREATE ANIMATION AND TO BE A HAND DRAWN ANIMATOR WHICH IT IS KIND OF A RARE BREED THESE DAYS BUT TO BE EITHER ONE YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN FORM HOW THE BODY MOVES AND TO BE ABLE TO DRAW WITHIN THOSE PARAMETERS
g_LPgfiX7Ik_10 0 THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY TO BE MADE IN THIS FIELD CAUSE IT'S VERY THERE AREN'T TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD AT THIS PARTICULAR SKILL SO IF YOU FIND YOURSELF REALLY PASSIONATE FEELING PASSIONATE ABOUT DRAWING THESE TYPES OF IMAGES THEN ABSOLUTELY GO FOR THAT THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO BUILD UP YOUR PORTFOLIO AND THEN TO SUBMIT IT TO DIFFERENT EITHER AGENCIES OR ACTUAL PUBLISHERS OR ANIMATING HOUSES THEMSELVES
g_LPgfiX7Ik_11 0 GET YOUR FOOT IN THE DOOR AND WORK YOUR WAY UP FROM THERE
g_LPgfiX7Ik_12 0 ANOTHER WAY AND IN MY MIND THIS WOULD BE JUST ABOUT EVERY ARTIST'S DREAM IS TO MOVE TO SOME PLACE LIKE NEW YORK PARIS ITALY SOME YEAH EXOTIC FOREIGN LOCATION ANYWHERE LIKE THAT OPEN UP YOUR LITTLE ART GALLERY YOUR VERY OWN LITTLE ART GALLERY AND JUST PAINT
g_LPgfiX7Ik_13 0 DESIGN DRAW WHATEVER FROM YOUR OWN STUDIO AND THEN YOU KNOW HAVE PEOPLE YOU KNOW WALKING OFF THE STREET AND TO APPRECIATE YOUR WORK YOU KNOW HAVE IT DISPLAYED IN GALLERIES ACROSS THE WORLD AND YOU KNOW LIVE THE GOOD LIFE BASICALLY
g_LPgfiX7Ik_14 0 NOW THIS IS YOUR DREAM AND ASPIRATION AND IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE THE SKILL AND THE PASSION GO FOR IT I THINK THAT'S THE MOST NOBLE WAY IN MY MIND TO MAKE A LIVING AS AN ARTIST
g_LPgfiX7Ik_15 0 TO DO IT LITERALLY ON YOUR OWN LIVING OFF YOUR WORK YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOUR OWN BOSS YOU MAKE YOUR OWN HOURS IT REALLY DOESN'T GET MUCH BETTER THAN THAT
g_LPgfiX7Ik_16 0 IF YOU BECOME A SUCCESS AT IT THEN THE SKY IS THE LIMIT
g_LPgfiX7Ik_17 0 YOU OFFICIALLY ARRIVED
g_LPgfiX7Ik_18 0 AND THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE WAYS TO MAKE A LIVING AS AN ARTIST
HDMSeQVMHE8_1 0 SO IN THIS CLIP I'LL BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO START WITH YOUR ALIGNMENT BY FOCUSING ON YOUR POSTURE AND STARTING WITH A NICE SEATED MEDITATION IN YOUR CHAIR THAT WILL BEGIN YOUR PRACTICE FOR THOSE WHO ARE SENIORS OR WHO HAVE LIMITED RANGE OF MOBILITY DUE TO INJURY OR LESS FLEXIBILITY
HDMSeQVMHE8_2 0 SO SITTING IN YOUR CHAIR MAKE SURE IT'S BRACED UP AGAINST THE WALL AND IT'S ON YOUR STICKY MAT SO IT'S NOT GOING TO SLIDE ANYWHERE
HDMSeQVMHE8_3 0 AND THEN AS YOU SIT SEE IF YOU CAN NOT LET YOUR BACK REST ALL THE WAY AGAINST THE BACKREST BUT SEE IF YOU CAN SIT UP NICE AND TALL
HDMSeQVMHE8_4 0 YOU CAN EVEN HOLD ONTO THE SIDES OF THE CHAIR
HDMSeQVMHE8_5 0 AND THEN NOTICE MY TAILBONE
HDMSeQVMHE8_6 0 I CAN KEEP AN ARCH IN MY BACK OR I CAN TUCK MY TAILBONE AND LET IT DROP A LITTLE BIT
HDMSeQVMHE8_7 0 SO SEE IF YOU CAN LET THE TAILBONE DROP REACH THROUGH THE CROWN OF THE HEAD ROLL THE SHOULDERS OPEN AND BACK AND THE FEET PRESS INTO THE FLOOR
HDMSeQVMHE8_8 0 AND THEN GO AHEAD AND SEE IF YOU CAN RELAX THE HANDS ON THE THIGHS
HDMSeQVMHE8_9 0 IF IT FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE TO HOLD ONTO THE EDGES OF THE CHAIR THAT'S FINE OR YOU CAN RELAX THE HANDS ON THE THIGHS AND CLOSE THE EYES AND JUST PICTURE STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY AND JUST ROLL THE SHOULDERS OPEN REACH THROUGH THE CROWN OF THE HEAD AND REMEMBER YOUR THREE-PART BREATH FROM THE BELLY THROUGH THE RIBS UP TO THE TOPS OF THE LUNGS
HDMSeQVMHE8_10 0 AND GO AHEAD AND PICK WHAT'S CALLED A SANKALPA OR AN INTENTION FOR YOUR PRACTICE MAYBE IT'S JUST A FOCUS ON YOUR BREATH OR PERHAPS IT'S JUST TO ENJOY YOURSELF FOR THE TIME THAT YOU HAVE ON THE MAT AND BREATHE INTO THAT INTENTION
HDMSeQVMHE8_11 0 ONCE YOU FEEL CENTERED YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN YOUR PRACTICE FOR YOGA TODAY
GEkftZ-wKHE_1 0 HI I'M LES WHITLEY
GEkftZ-wKHE_2 0 TODAY I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SQUAT
GEkftZ-wKHE_3 0 THE SQUAT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST OVERALL EFFECTIVE EXERCISES IN TRAINING LET ALONE TO IMPROVE MUSCULATURE OF THE LOWER BODY
GEkftZ-wKHE_4 0 WHEN DONE CORRECTLY TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF YOUR KNEES AS WELL AS THE LOWER BACK
GEkftZ-wKHE_5 0 THE SQUAT SHOULD ALWAYS BE INITIATED BY HAVING A GOOD STANCE GOOD RANGE OF MOTION GOOD FLEXIBILITY WHILE BEING UNDER CONTROL
GEkftZ-wKHE_6 0 A BODY WEIGHT SQUAT AGAIN HEELS AT OR SLIGHTLY WIDER THAN SHOULDERS WIDTH
GEkftZ-wKHE_7 0 MOVING THE HIPS BACK FIRST TO INITIATE THE MOVEMENT
GEkftZ-wKHE_8 0 KEEPING THE CHEST AND BODY IN A GOOD UPRIGHT POSITION
GEkftZ-wKHE_9 0 ARMS FOR BALANCE CAN BE OUT IN FRONT CROSSED OVER OR AT HIP LEVEL
GEkftZ-wKHE_10 0 LOWERING THE BODY AGAIN DOWN THROUGH A FULL RANGE OF MOTION AS COMFORTABLE
GEkftZ-wKHE_11 0 GRADUALLY LOWER YOURSELF AS FLEXIBILITY IMPROVES
GEkftZ-wKHE_12 0 AS YOU MOVE TO THE SQUAT RACK STARTING OFF WITH A GOOD EVEN HAND POSITION ON THE BAR
GEkftZ-wKHE_13 0 ADDRESSING THE BAR BENEATH
GEkftZ-wKHE_14 0 THE BAR IN GOOD PROPER POSITION ACROSS THE UPPER BACK AND LOWER PART OF THE SHOULDER
GEkftZ-wKHE_15 0 LIFTING THE BAR UP UNDER GOOD CONTROL STEPPING OUT GOOD FOOT STANCE MAKING SURE THE KNEES TRAVEL IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE TOES
GEkftZ-wKHE_16 0 HIP MOVE BACK AWAY FROM MIDLINE TO INITIATE THE MOTION
GEkftZ-wKHE_17 0 BENDING AT THE KNEES LOWERING YOURSELF DOWN UNDER GOOD CONTROL
GEkftZ-wKHE_19 0 WHILE LOWERING IN THE BOTTOM PHASE MAINTAINING A GOOD FLAT BACK IF NOT A SLIGHT ARCH IN THE SMALL OF THE BACK FOR PROTECTION
GEkftZ-wKHE_20 0 WHAT YOU DON'T WANT IS A ROUNDED POSITION FOR THE SPINE TO GET OUT OF SO THAT YOU RUN THE RISK OF INJURING THE LOWER BACK
GEkftZ-wKHE_21 0 THE KNEES AS I MENTIONED SHOULD FOLLOW THE SAME DIRECTION OF THE TOES
GEkftZ-wKHE_22 0 KNEES SHOULD NOT BUCKLE IN IF THE TOES ARE POINTED OUT
GEkftZ-wKHE_23 0 IF TOES ARE STRAIGHT AHEAD SAME THING KNEES SHOULD NOT DEVIATE FROM THE SAME LINE AS THE TOES DIRECTION
GEkftZ-wKHE_24 0 USE THESE EXERCISES TO DEVELOP GOOD POWERFUL STRONG LOWER BODY
GEkftZ-wKHE_25 0 BUT DO IT SAFELY BY FOLLOWING THOSE TECHNIQUES
gHik_54lD7s_1 0 HELLO I'M SIFU MALLON WITH THE CLEARWATER KUNG FU CENTER
gHik_54lD7s_2 0 THIS IS MY ASSISTANT MELISSA AND THIS IS KUNG FU FOR HEALTH
gHik_54lD7s_3 0 THE FOOTWORK THAT WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH IS CALLED OUR FIGHTING STANCE
gHik_54lD7s_4 0 THIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF ALL THE DIFFERENT FOOTWORK EXERCISES THAT YOU'LL SEE
gHik_54lD7s_5 0 TO START WITH YOUR FEET
gHik_54lD7s_6 0 OKAY YOU CAN PLACE BOTH YOUR FEET TOGETHER
gHik_54lD7s_7 0 YOU'RE GOING TO TURN YOUR RIGHT FOOT OUT FORTY-FIVE DEGREES
gHik_54lD7s_8 0 YOU'RE GOING TO STEP FORWARD WITH YOUR LEFT FOOT ABOUT THE WIDTH OF YOUR SHOULDERS OR OUTSIDE WIDTH OF YOUR SHOULDERS
gHik_54lD7s_9 0 OKAY NOW YOU'LL NOTICE THAT BOTH FEET ARE POINTING IN THE SAME GENERAL DIRECTION
gHik_54lD7s_10 0 SO IF I TAKE TWO LINES POINTING FROM MY TOES THEY'LL BOTH FOLLOW OUT THIS WAY
gHik_54lD7s_11 0 A LOT OF TIMES YOU'LL SEE PEOPLE MAKE THE MISTAKE OF GOING THROUGH THE POSITION WITH THEIR REAR FOOT TURNED BACK OR THEIR REAR FOOT TURNED THIS WAY
gHik_54lD7s_12 0 THIS DOESN'T GIVE YOU A VERY MOBILE STANCE
gHik_54lD7s_13 0 SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH FEET ARE TURNED IN THE SAME DIRECTION
gHik_54lD7s_14 0 WE ALSO WANT TO PLACE THE WEIGHT ON THE BALLS OF YOUR FEET
gHik_54lD7s_15 0 YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO GO LIFTING YOUR HEELS UP LIKE THIS BUT YOU WANT TO FEEL THE PRESSURE OKAY ON THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT
gHik_54lD7s_16 0 THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS TO ROCK BACK AND FORTH SO THAT YOU CAN FEEL WHERE YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY IS
gHik_54lD7s_17 0 OKAY AND YOU FEEL THE PRESSURE ON THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT
gHik_54lD7s_18 0 THE HANDS ARE IN WHAT'S CALLED A SPLIT GUARD POSITION
gHik_54lD7s_19 0 MELISSA'S GOING TO TAKE HER LEFT HAND OKAY AND LIFT IT UP THIS WAY
gHik_54lD7s_20 0 SHE'S GOING TO BRING HER RIGHT HAND CROSSING THE LOWER BODY THIS WAY
gHik_54lD7s_21 0 HER SHOULDERS STAY RELAXED
gHik_54lD7s_22 0 THE UPPER ARM WILL BE USED MAINLY FOR BLOCKING HIGH TECHNIQUES
gHik_54lD7s_23 0 THE LOWER ARM WILL BE MAINLY BLOCKING FOR LOWER TECHNIQUES
gHik_54lD7s_24 0 FOR STRONG VERY STRONG BODY TECHNIQUES BOTH HANDS WOULD COME TOGETHER
gHik_54lD7s_25 0 THIS IS CALLED OUR FIGHTING STANCE
gHik_54lD7s_26 0 I'LL PERFORM IT ON A STRAIGHT ANGLE SO YOU CAN SEE IT FROM THE FORWARD POSITION HERE
gHik_54lD7s_27 0 OKAY AND THEN YOU WILL REPEAT THE SAME THING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
gHik_54lD7s_28 0 THIS IS FIGHTING STANCE KUNG FU FOR HEALTH
h1sovGXZDqQ_1 0 HI I'M DR KANE WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND ALSO THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK HOW TO BECOME A PROFESSIONAL BACHELOR
h1sovGXZDqQ_2 0 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROTECTING YOUR ASSETS IN A BREAKUP WHICH INEVITABLY WILL OCCUR UNLESS YOU MARRY THE WOMAN
h1sovGXZDqQ_3 0 WELL ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS A PROFESSIONAL BACHELOR MUST LEARN IS HOW TO CONTROL HIS OR HER EMOTIONS
h1sovGXZDqQ_4 0 LET ME TELL YOU THIS IS NOT AN EASY CHAPTER
h1sovGXZDqQ_5 0 IF YOU HAVE GROWN UP LOVING SENSING BEAUTY AND JUST HAVING VERVE FOR LIFE YOU ESSENTIALLY ARE AN EMOTIONAL PERSON
h1sovGXZDqQ_6 0 HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES TO DATING AND BECOMING A PROFESSIONAL BACHELOR YOU NEED TO BE CALLOUS COOL COLLECTED CALM AND PROFESSIONAL
h1sovGXZDqQ_7 0 THAT MEANS YOUR EMOTIONS CANNOT TAKE THE BEST OF YOU
h1sovGXZDqQ_8 0 SO WHEN YOU DECIDE TO BREAK UP WITH SOMEONE YOU DO IT IN STYLE YOU DO IT QUICKLY BUT YOU EMOTIONALLY NEED TO BE COLD AND TO THE POINT
h1sovGXZDqQ_9 0 YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING A SERVICE FOR YOUR MATE BECAUSE IF YOU SHOW ANY SIGNS OF WEAKNESS THEY WILL POUNCE ON YOU AND TRY TO RE-DATE YOU OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE
h1sovGXZDqQ_10 0 SO AGAIN CONTROLLING YOUR EMOTIONS IS ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS IN DISTINGUISHING A PROFESSIONAL BACHELOR FROM A SLOPPY BACHELOR
Ha-QrxCjDk0_1 0 OK WHAT I'VE GO SO FAR IS ELEVEN COLUMNS AROUND
Ha-QrxCjDk0_2 0 TWELVE IS A GOOD NUMBER FOR YOUR BASE RING
Ha-QrxCjDk0_3 0 AND THEN GO UNDER ONE MORE TIME
Ha-QrxCjDk0_4 0 GOT TO DO THOSE FIRST TWO
Ha-QrxCjDk0_5 0 AND DO THE SECOND TWO
Ha-QrxCjDk0_6 0 IT'S JUST A BASIC DOUBLE CROCHET
Ha-QrxCjDk0_7 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO CONNECT THE SAME WAY THAT A GRANNY SQUARE DOES
Ha-QrxCjDk0_8 0 WE WANT TO COUNT UP ONE TWO THREE
Ha-QrxCjDk0_9 0 AND YOU TAKE IT RIGHT THERE
Ha-QrxCjDk0_10 0 NOW WHEN YOU DO THIS WHEN YOU PULL IT THROUGH TO CONNECT YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR CIRCLE IS PRETTY FLAT
Ha-QrxCjDk0_11 0 YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE BOWING OUT TOO MUCH
Ha-QrxCjDk0_12 0 IF IT DOES THAT MEANS YOU MAY HAVE TOO MANY COLUMNS
Ha-QrxCjDk0_13 0 TWELVE SHOULD BE A GOOD NUMBER
Ha-QrxCjDk0_14 0 IF YOU'VE GOT A HEAVIER YARN AND IT'S STICKING OUT TOO MUCH TAKE IT DOWN
Ha-QrxCjDk0_15 0 JUST GO AHEAD AND TAKE A FEW OUT
Ha-QrxCjDk0_16 0 JUST WORK YOUR WAY DOWN
Ha-QrxCjDk0_17 0 TRY TO STAY IN EITHER MULTIPLES OF THREE OR TWO BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE PATTERN WORKS AS WE EXPAND ON OUR CIRCLE
Ha-QrxCjDk0_18 0 BUT IF THIS IS TOO HEAVY IF IT'S BULKING UP OR IF IT'S WRINKLING UP LIKE THAT YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE A COUPLE OF COLUMNS OUT NOW BEFORE WE GET TOO FAR IN OUR PATTERN
Ha-QrxCjDk0_19 0 AND THEN IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF YOUR TIME
Ha-QrxCjDk0_20 0 BUT TWELVE FOR THIS MEDIUM WEIGHT YARN IS A GOOD NUMBER FOR OUR BASE CIRCLE SO IT CAN CONTINUE
GdlXzDmgnSM_1 0 VINCENT JAMAL HI I'M VINCENT ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GdlXzDmgnSM_2 0 NOW WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANYBODY AROUND AND CHRIS IS OVER HERE AND BRIAN'S JUST DOING HIS WORKOUT WHAT BRIAN CAN DO AND I JUST CALL IT THE LONELY BOY WORKOUT IS JUST THROW THE BALL UP TO YOURSELF AND WORK ON CATCHING JUST WORK ON YOUR CATCHING TECHNIQUE
GdlXzDmgnSM_3 0 THROW THE BALL UP
GdlXzDmgnSM_4 0 WORK ON YOUR CATCHING TECHNIQUE
GdlXzDmgnSM_5 0 NOW AS BRIAN GETS MORE COMFORTABLE HE CAN THROW THE BALL UP EMULATE A RUNNING AND THEN BREAK DOWN AND CATCH THE BALL
GdlXzDmgnSM_6 0 AND THIS WILL BE THE TRUEST THING THAT HE CAN DO FOR HIMSELF IS TO KEEP HIS ARMS PUMPING JUST LIKE HE WOULD DURING RUNNING A ROUTE AND GET THE BALL RIGHT INTO HIS WINDOW
GdlXzDmgnSM_7 0 GET YOUR WINDOW OVER AND YOU CAN THROW IT IN DIFFERENT AREAS AND GET YOUR WINDOW
GdlXzDmgnSM_8 0 NOW AS YOU GET A LITTLE BIT MORE SOPHISTICATED WITH IT YOU AGGRESSIVELY CATCH THE BALL OUT OF THE AIR
GdlXzDmgnSM_9 0 SO YOU WANT TO ATTACK THE BALL WHICH IS WHAT YOU WOULD DO DURING A PASSING PATTERN YOU WANT TO ATTACK THE BALL AND GET IT INTO YOUR POSSESSION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
GdlXzDmgnSM_10 0 ONCE AGAIN ATTACK AND GET IT INTO YOUR POSSESSION
GdlXzDmgnSM_11 0 NOW I'VE DONE SOME OTHER ONES WHERE YOU CAN SPIN AROUND AND CATCH THE BALL AND THESE ARE FOR DOWN DEEP PATTERNS WHERE YOU'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING BACK OVER YOUR SHOULDER AND IT'S THE TRUEST WAY TO DISORIENT YOURSELF AND LOCATE THE BALL AT THE SAME TIME
GdlXzDmgnSM_12 0 BRIAN GO AHEAD AND TRY IT OUT
GdlXzDmgnSM_13 0 AND HE CREATES HIS WINDOW PUMPS THE ARMS AND THE SPIN
GdlXzDmgnSM_14 0 AND BRIAN CAN DO THIS A HUNDRED TIMES A DAY AND HIS HAND WILL IMPROVE HIS VISION FOR THE BALL AND HIS ABILITY TO LOCATE
HguhKS5ke_s_1 0 THIS PAIR OF UNDERWEAR IS VERY VERY ATHLETIC
HguhKS5ke_s_2 0 I WAS THINKING ABOUT MOVEMENT RANGE OF MOTION AND COMFORT AND NO WEDGIES AND SO THEREFORE IT LED ME TO DO MY FABRICS THAT I USED FOR THE COLLECTION WERE ALL UNDERWEAR FABRICS LYCRA KNITS SPANDEX THAT STAYED LIKE THE NO RISING UP KIND OF FABRICS
HguhKS5ke_s_3 0 AND THESE I USED TO DESIGN DETAIL TO MAKE THEM A LITTLE BIT APPEALING BUT THEY ARE BASICALLY FOR FUNCTIONALITY AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH FUNCTIONALITY FUNCTIONALITY IS NECESSARY
HguhKS5ke_s_4 0 YOU CAN'T ALWAYS BE THE AVANT GARDE DESIGNER BECAUSE EVEN THEN IF YOU'RE ALWAYS THAT PERSON THAT DOES THINGS A LITTLE BIT OFF THAT LITTLE BIT OF OFF IS GOING TO BECOME MUNDANE AFTER A WHILE
HguhKS5ke_s_5 0 IT'S GOING TO CROSS OVER TO THAT LEVEL WHERE ALL YOUR CRAZY STUFF CEASES TO BE CRAZY
HguhKS5ke_s_6 0 IT'S EXPECTED AND WHO LIKES TO DO THE EXPECTED
HguhKS5ke_s_7 0 IF YOU'RE ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING CRAZY AND WHACKED OUT AND WEIRD PEOPLE ARE GOING TO EXPECT THAT SO YOU KNOW WHAT ONE SEASON HIT THEM WITH FUNCTIONALITY
HguhKS5ke_s_8 0 DO SOMETHING COMPLETELY BASIC STARK AND FUNCTIONAL
HguhKS5ke_s_9 0 THESE ARE BOY SHORTS
HguhKS5ke_s_10 0 THEY HAVE A STRAIGHT ACROSS WAISTBAND TO LIMIT RIDING UP MOVING DOWN
HguhKS5ke_s_11 0 THEN THE LEG HOLES ARE STRAIGHT ACROSS TOO BECAUSE I WANTED IT
HguhKS5ke_s_12 0 EASILY THESE ARE A TUBE TOP AND BOTTOM
GVhjE4kRn-4_1 0 IN THIS EXAMPLE WHAT I'M GOING TO SHOW IS A KIND OF A FINGER STYLE EXCEPT I'M GOING TO BE USING A PICK SO IT'S ACTUALLY A HYBRID KIND OF PICKING IS WHAT THEY CALL WHERE I'M USING PICK AND FINGERS
GVhjE4kRn-4_2 0 AND A WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS PLAY E MAJOR PASSAGE FINGER PICKED AND YOUR HYBRID PICKED RATHER OVER A BASIC DRUM BEAT
GVhjE4kRn-4_3 0 SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO HERE IS START WITH E ON THE D STRING ON THE SECOND FRET ON THE D STRING AND USING MY PINKY ON THE FOURTH FRET OF THE G OR I'M SORRY ON THE HIGH E STRING WHICH IS G# AND PLAYING THE A THE B AND THE G OPEN
GVhjE4kRn-4_4 0 SO I'M GOING TO BE GOING OR ACTUALLY JUST THE B STRING SO
GVhjE4kRn-4_5 0 THEN SLIDING UP TO FOUR AND FIVE ON THE D AND THE E STRINGS AND THEN THE FIFTH AND SEVENTH FRET ON THE D AND E STRINGS BACK TO THE FOUR AND FIVE AND THEN BACK TO SECOND AND FOURTH ON THE YOU KNOW WHICH IS THE E CHORDS
GVhjE4kRn-4_6 0 THE ROOT NOTE SO SO PLAYED OVER A BASIC DRUM BEAT IT'LL SOUND LIKE THIS
GVhjE4kRn-4_7 0 SO WHAT I'M DOING THERE AGAIN IS JUST DOING A SIMPLE FINGER STYLE PATTERN OVER BASIC DRUM BEAT AND COULD SOUND VERY GOOD FOR A SONG YOU MIGHT WRITE IN THE ROCK STYLE
gGSns9nz4-I_1 0 IN THIS TAPE WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO BECOME A US MARSHAL
gGSns9nz4-I_2 0 A US MARSHAL IS KIND OF LIKE A BAILIFF EXCEPT THAT IS NOT THE TERM THAT THEY USE
gGSns9nz4-I_3 0 THEY ARE FEDERAL POLICE OFFICERS AND CERTIFIED
gGSns9nz4-I_4 0 THEY CARRY FIREARMS
gGSns9nz4-I_5 0 THEY CAN MAKE ARRESTS BUT MOST OF THE TIME WHAT YOU SEE FROM THE US MARSHAL AGENTS OFFICERS ARE THEY'RE IN FEDERAL COURT THAT IS WHAT THEY SPECIALIZE IN
gGSns9nz4-I_6 0 WHAT THEY DO IS THEY GUARD PRISONERS THAT HAVE BEEN HOUSED ARRESTED OR JAILED BECAUSE OF FEDERAL OFFENSES
gGSns9nz4-I_7 0 YOU HAVE TO HAVE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS YOU HAVE TO BE A CERTAIN AGE THEY DO REQUIRE COLLEGE AND/OR SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERIENCE
gGSns9nz4-I_8 0 AGAIN YOU MUST APPLY ON LINE THE INTERNET IS YOUR BEST MARKETING TOOL
gGSns9nz4-I_9 0 YOU MUST REMOVE THE INFORMATION FROM THE INTERNET REVIEW THE APPLICATION AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU MEET THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS
gGSns9nz4-I_10 0 AND AGAIN I CAN'T STRESS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR YOU TO BE HONEST ON THE APPLICATION BECAUSE ON THE APPLICATION THE CHANCES ARE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO SEE SOME OF THE INFORMATION AGAIN ON A POLYGRAPH AND ONCE YOU HAVE SUBMITTED THE APPLICATION THEY WILL GET BACK WITH YOU
gGSns9nz4-I_11 0 IT WILL PROBABLY BE BETWEEN SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR AT WHICH TIME THEY WILL GIVE YOU OTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL PHYSICAL EYE AND A POLYGRAPH EXAM TO SEE IF YOU QUALIFY
h7CsRlZyI38_1 0 HI I'M LEAH ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE SOME QUICK AND EASY TURKISH DISHES
h7CsRlZyI38_2 0 SO OUR FIRST DISH TODAY IS A TURKISH PASTA
h7CsRlZyI38_3 0 IT'S A MAIN DISH THAT WE CAN SERVE WITH WHATEVER KIND OF SIDE DISHES WE WANT
h7CsRlZyI38_4 0 THIS IS KIND OF A TURKISH VERSION OF A MACARONI AND CHEESE
h7CsRlZyI38_5 0 SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND TALK ABOUT THE INGREDIENTS
h7CsRlZyI38_6 0 THE FIRST THING WE HAVE IS A CUP OF MILK AND WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO WARM IT UP BEFORE WE USE IT
h7CsRlZyI38_7 0 WE HAVE PARSLEY WE HAVE PASTA
h7CsRlZyI38_8 0 TODAY I HAVE A SORT OF SPIRAL NOODLE BUT YOU CAN USE WHATEVER KIND YOU WANT
h7CsRlZyI38_9 0 WE HAVE FOUR EGGS FOUR TABLESPOONS OF BUTTER
h7CsRlZyI38_10 0 TO SEASON IT UP WE HAVE NUTMEG WHITE PEPPER SINCE THIS IS A WHITE SAUCE AND SEA SALT
h7CsRlZyI38_11 0 WE HAVE FLOUR TO THICKEN UP THE SAUCE AND THEN THE CHEESES WE ARE GOING TO USE ARE MOZARELLA AND FETA CHEESE
h7CsRlZyI38_12 0 SO THE FIRST THING THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO FOR OUR TURKISH PASTA IS GO AHEAD AND BOIL THE NOODLES
h7CsRlZyI38_13 0 NOW WE'LL START OUT BY SALTING THE WATER
h7CsRlZyI38_14 0 THIS IS GOING TO HELP FLAVOR THE PASTA LATER
h7CsRlZyI38_15 0 JUST PUT A SMALL PALMFULL AND GIVE IT A QUICK MIX
h7CsRlZyI38_16 0 THAT SEA SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THERE REAL EASILY
h7CsRlZyI38_17 0 AND WE'LL GO AHEAD AND DROP IN ABOUT A CUP OR SO OF OUR SPIRAL NOODLES
h7CsRlZyI38_18 0 AGAIN IF YOU HAVE PENNE OR BOWTIE WHATEVER KIND OF NOODLE YOU HAVE IN YOUR PANTRY IS JUST FINE
h7CsRlZyI38_19 0 GO AHEAD AND MIX IT UP AND WE WILL COOK IT FOR ABOUT ELEVEN MINUTES AND THAT WILL COOK IT TO AL DENTE
gzHP25oI84E_1 0 HI I'M STAN DEFREITAS MR GREEN THUMB
gzHP25oI84E_2 0 THIS IS COMMON BASIL AND WE HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF BASILS BUT THIS ONE LIKE MOST OF THE BASILS NEEDS A GOOD DEAL OF MOISTURE
gzHP25oI84E_3 0 I LIKE TO BREAK OFF LITTLE SPRIGS SOMETIMES
gzHP25oI84E_4 0 AND USE IT IN COOKING
gzHP25oI84E_5 0 YOU CAN USE IT AROUND CHICKEN DISHES
gzHP25oI84E_6 0 BUT I ALSO JUST BREAK OFF LITTLE SECTIONS SOMETIMES JUST FOR TEAS
gzHP25oI84E_7 0 YOU'RE HAVING SOME ICED TEA OR HOT TEA AND YOU WANT TO ADD SOME FLAVOR TO IT BREAK OFF A LITTLE SECTION OF LEAF AND IT MAKES A NICE PICK-ME-UP FOR YOUR TEA AS WELL
gzHP25oI84E_8 0 BUT YOU CAN USE IT OF COURSE IN MANY DIFFERENT DISHES
gzHP25oI84E_9 0 IT DOES REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF PEAT MOSS AND ORGANIC MATERIAL FOR IT TO DO IT'S BEST
gzHP25oI84E_10 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOU WATER IT ON A REGULAR BASIS
gzHP25oI84E_11 0 THIS MEANS THE SIZE OF THE CONTAINER AND THIS CLAY POT MAY BE EVERY SECOND OR THIRD DAY
gzHP25oI84E_12 0 DON'T LET IT GET TOO DRY OR IT TENDS TO GO TO SEED
gzHP25oI84E_13 0 IT WILL FLOWER AND THEN THE PLANT SOMETIMES STARTS TO SHUT DOWN
gzHP25oI84E_14 0 OFTEN WITH HERBS YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP PICKING OFF THAT NEW GROWTH AND THE MORE YOU PICK THE MORE THE LATERAL BUDS WILL SPREAD YOU'LL GET A MUCH BUSHIER PLANT AND YOU'LL GET A PLANT THAT WILL LAST A LOT LONGER
gzHP25oI84E_15 0 BY DOING THAT OF COURSE YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD PLANT FOR YOUR BACKYARD GARDENING
gzHP25oI84E_16 0 FOR ON GARDENING I'M STAN DEFREITAS MR GREEN THUMB
H8U2Ylj0cys_1 0 HI I AM KATALIN THE CREATOR OF CREATIVE ENGLISH IN HUNGRY
H8U2Ylj0cys_2 0 WE ARE HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
H8U2Ylj0cys_3 0 WE ARE GOING TO SHOW YOU A FEW TASTY SNACKS
H8U2Ylj0cys_4 0 I THINK CHILDREN SHOULD START EATING HEALTHY FOODS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE
H8U2Ylj0cys_5 0 SO I WOULD RECOMMEND TO GIVE THEM HEALTHY FOODS STRAIGHT AFTER BREAST FEEDING OR BOTTLE FEEDING
H8U2Ylj0cys_6 0 SO EVEN THEIR FIRST FOOD SHOULD BE SOMETHING NATURAL
H8U2Ylj0cys_7 0 YOU CAN START WITH FRUIT AND LATER ON YOU CAN ADD SOME MORE FLAVOR THAT THEY CAN ENJOY THE FOOD
H8U2Ylj0cys_8 0 AND LATER ONE YOU CAN MAKE COOKIES WITH THEM OR EVEN HAVE THE FRUIT STICKS OR VEGETABLE PIECES AND DIFFERENT DIPS OR COLD MEAL
H8U2Ylj0cys_9 0 IF YOU PLANT THIS IDEA AT HOME THAT MAKING FOOD TOGETHER CAN BE FUN AND THEY GET TO TASTE THESE NATURAL TASTES THEY WON'T LIKE THE ARTIFICIALLY SWEETENED OR REFINED OR THOSE FOODS THAT FULL WITH REFINED SUGAR BECAUSE IT WILL BE TOO MUCH FOR THEIR BODIES
H8U2Ylj0cys_10 0 LOTS OF CHILDREN EAT SCHOOL DINNER AT SCHOOL BUT LOTS OF THEM TAKE PACKED LUNCH WITH THEM
H8U2Ylj0cys_11 0 IF YOU GIVE THEM PACKED LUNCH YOU ORGANIZE THEIR FOOD INPUT
H8U2Ylj0cys_12 0 IN TO THEIR LUNCH BOX YOU CAN PUT SOME HEALTHY HEALTHY SNACKS OR EVEN SOMETIMES YOU CAN MAKE SOME SURPRISES FOR THEM THAT THEY WILL ENJOY EATING
H8U2Ylj0cys_13 0 AND VERY OFTEN THEY WILL SHARE IT WITH THEIR CLASSMATES WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THERE IS NO SUGAR IN THAT SNACK WHICH IS QUITE NICE
-HAXO8VSI_M_2 0 YOU NEED TOOLS
-HAXO8VSI_M_3 0 SO THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF TOOLS
-HAXO8VSI_M_4 0 I LIKE TO BUY THE METAL ONES BECAUSE THEY LAST LONGER
-HAXO8VSI_M_5 0 THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ONES THAT I HAVE
-HAXO8VSI_M_6 0 AND THIS ONE YOU USE TO START SCRAPING AWAY
-HAXO8VSI_M_7 0 THERE'S TWO SIDES TO IT
-HAXO8VSI_M_8 0 ONE HAS THE GROOVES IN IT AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE IS FLAT
-HAXO8VSI_M_9 0 I DON'T KNOW WHETHER AND A LOT OF TIMES AS I START FORMING THE CLAY ON THE ARMATURE I HAVE TO KEEP TAKING IT AWAY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO SHAPE IT UNTIL YOU GET THE SHAPE THAT YOU WANT
-HAXO8VSI_M_10 0 AND THEN THERE'S DIFFERENT TEXTURES
-HAXO8VSI_M_11 0 I LIKE TO USE THE CROSS SECTIONS A LOT OF TIMES BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO TO TURN IT INTO BRONZE AND YOU DO THE PATINA ON IT IT'S GOING TO PICK UP VARIOUS COLORS WHICH IS IMPORTANT
-HAXO8VSI_M_12 0 BUT ALSO ONE OF MY MAIN TOOLS ARE MY FINGERS
-HAXO8VSI_M_13 0 BECAUSE I LOVE TO USE MY FINGERS
-HAXO8VSI_M_14 0 AND THEN AFTER I CREATE THE PIECE LIKE DOWN HERE YOU'LL NOTICE THAT I USE LIKE AN ORGANIC TYPE FEELING WHERE I USE MY THUMBS
-HAXO8VSI_M_15 0 OH YOU CAN'T SEE THAT
-HAXO8VSI_M_16 0 MY THUMBS I USE MY THUMBS A LOT ON THE BASES OF MY SCULPTURE
-HAXO8VSI_M_17 0 AND I LOVE TO PULL THE CLAY THIS WAY
-HAXO8VSI_M_18 0 IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE EFFECT THAT I WANT
-HAXO8VSI_M_19 0 BUT WE GO FROM KNIVES I USE A BIG KNIFE TO HELP ME CUT THE CLAY AND THEN IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE TEXTURE THAT I WANT
-HAXO8VSI_M_20 0 SOME OF THE TOOLS GET VERY INTRICATE BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES YOU HAVE TO GET INTO LITTLE TEENY AREAS
-HAXO8VSI_M_21 0 AND THIS LOOK AT HOW SMALL THAT TOOL IS
-HAXO8VSI_M_22 0 AND THEN THE FINEST ONE OF ALL IS THE LITTLE TOOL THAT YOU USE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY SIGN THE SCULPTURE
-HAXO8VSI_M_23 0 SO I HAVE THIS LITTLE PEN
-HAXO8VSI_M_24 0 IT'S NOT REALLY A PEN
-HAXO8VSI_M_25 0 IT'S GOT A LITTLE ROUND THING ON THE END OF IT
-HAXO8VSI_M_26 0 I USE THAT TO SIGN MY SCULPTURES WITH
-HAXO8VSI_M_27 0 AND THERE'S ALL KINDS OF SHAPES AND SIZES
-HAXO8VSI_M_28 0 THE DENTIST GAVE ME THESE
-HAXO8VSI_M_29 0 THE TOOLS COME IN ALL DIFFERENT SIZES AND SHAPES
-HAXO8VSI_M_30 0 THIS IS LIKE A FLAT ONE WHERE YOU CAN FLATTEN THE CLAY OUT
-HAXO8VSI_M_31 0 AND THEN A LOT OF THESE HAVE THE TEXTURE THING ON ONE SIDE AND NOT ON THE OTHER SIDE
-HAXO8VSI_M_32 0 AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW TO USE THESE BECAUSE ACTUALLY IT TAKES TIME TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THEM
-HAXO8VSI_M_33 0 BUT SOME ARTISTS USE DIFFERENT THINGS
-HAXO8VSI_M_34 0 THEY MAKES THEIR OWN TOOLS
-HAXO8VSI_M_35 0 OH HERE'S ANOTHER INTERESTING TOOL
-HAXO8VSI_M_36 0 SEE THAT HAS A PRETTY BIG GROOVE THAT IT CREATES
-HAXO8VSI_M_37 0 IF YOU WANT A DIFFERENT TYPE OF GROOVE YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE A FORK OR A BUTTER KNIFE OR THE DENTAL TOOLS
-HAXO8VSI_M_38 0 I HAVE ALL THESE DENTAL TOOLS THAT WE USE
-HAXO8VSI_M_39 0 THIS ONE I USE A LOT BECAUSE ALL THIS BASICALLY DOES IS MOVES THE CLAY IN SMALLER PORTIONS AWAY FROM THE SCULPTURE
gQKVs3gYILQ_1 0 THE NEXT THING I'M GOING TO GO OVER IS JUST DIFFERENT PARTS OF EXPLORING GARAGE BAND
gQKVs3gYILQ_2 0 THERE'S A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT LITTLE POP UP MENUS AND DIFFERENT T HINGS YOU CAN OPEN UP TO TWEAK OUT SOUNDS AND ADJUST DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TRACK
gQKVs3gYILQ_3 0 YOU CAN ALSO DO DIFFERENT THINGS SUCH AS FAR AS ZOOMING TO TRY TO QUANTIZE THINGS A CERTAIN WAY AS WELL AS TRY TO EDIT IT IN WAY WHERE YOUR TRACKS WOULD BE MORE BY DRAWING IN DATA OR BRINGING IN SAMPLES WHATEVER
gQKVs3gYILQ_4 0 ALSO I'M GOING TO GO OVER THE ALPHA LOOPS AND HOW THOSE WORK AND HOW YOU'RE ABLE TO BRING THOSE IN AND COMBINE THOSE WITH YOUR SONG
gQKVs3gYILQ_5 0 SO YOU FILL IN YOUR SONGS AND ADD MORE OF A LIVE AUDIO FEEL TO THEM
gQKVs3gYILQ_6 0 I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF SOFTWARE INSTRUMENTS THAT YOU COULD USE WITHIN GARAGE BAND
gQKVs3gYILQ_7 0 THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF DIFFERENT PACKS YOU CAN USE
gQKVs3gYILQ_8 0 IN THIS THING I CAN ALSO EXPLAIN TO YOU ABOUT DIFFERENT JAM PACKS AND DIFFERENT UPGRADES THAT YOU CAN ADD TO YOUR GARAGE BAND TO HELP YOU KNOW FILL UP YOUR SOUND LIBRARIES AND YOUR AUDIO FILES
gQKVs3gYILQ_9 0 SOMETIMES YOU GET SOMETHING LIKE LOGIC EIGHT THAT COMES WITH A BUNCH OF EXTRA GARAGE BAND THINGS THAT HELP FILL IT UP SO YOU CAN COME UP WITH EVEN MORE SOUNDS
GtUdgY3_vvI_1 0 THIS IS PEGGY CHARLTON FOR EXPERT VILLAGE ON HOW TO MAKE GREAT YEAST ROLLS
GtUdgY3_vvI_2 0 THEN I'M GOING TO PUT THIS IN THE REFRIGERATOR AND I'M GOING TO COVER IT OR PUT FOIL ON IT JUST WITH A CLOTH
GtUdgY3_vvI_3 0 I WILL BE LEAVING IT IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR AT LEAST TWO HOURS
GtUdgY3_vvI_4 0 IT'S OKAY IF YOU LEAVE IT LONGER THAN THAT IT'S NOT A PROBLEM I FOUND OVER THE YEARS CAUSE I MADE THIS SO MANY TIMES
GtUdgY3_vvI_5 0 ONE TIME I HAD TO LEAVE IT ALL NIGHT AND IT WAS OKAY BUT IT'S BEST TO JUST TO LEAVE IT A FEW HOURS IF YOU ARE SCHEDULED
GtUdgY3_vvI_6 0 SO YOU PUT IT IN THE REFRIGERATOR LEAVE IT THERE
HaqOVTah7bE_1 0 HI MY NAME IS OTIS ST CLAIR AND TODAY I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WEIGHT TRAINING FOR INCREASED SPEED
HaqOVTah7bE_2 0 WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TWO MAIN EXERCISES THAT WE CAN DO USING WEIGHTS TO INCREASE OUR SPEED TO BUILD POWER IN OUR LEGS AND GET FASTER
HaqOVTah7bE_3 0 FIRST THING WE ARE GOING TO DO IS WE ARE GOING TO DO ONE LEG STEPS USING A BAR BELL AND WEIGHTS
HaqOVTah7bE_4 0 WHAT WE DO IS PLACE THE BAR ON OUR BACK FIND A BOX OR STAIRS TO USE AND WE MAKE AN EXPLOSIVE MOVE UP USING OUR LEG THAT IS PLANTED ON THE BOX LIKE SO COME BACK DOWN AND SWITCH LEGS
HaqOVTah7bE_5 0 AGAIN THIS EXERCISE DEVELOPS POWER EXPLOSIVENESS IN OUR LOWER BODY OUR THIGHS OUR GLUTS AND OUR LOWER CALVES
HaqOVTah7bE_6 0 THE NEXT EXERCISE WE ARE GOING TO DO IS THE SLED PULL SO IF YOU WILL FOLLOW ME OVER HERE WE ARE GOING TO USE WEIGHT TO PULL THE SLED TO HELP INCREASE OUR POWER AND OUR STRENGTH
HaqOVTah7bE_7 0 WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A SLED WITH WEIGHT THAT IS ON IT ATTACHED TO A HARNESS
HaqOVTah7bE_8 0 WHAT WE'LL DO IS PLACE OURSELVES IN OUR HARNESS BUCKLE OUR SEAT BELTS BECAUSE THAT'S THE LAW AND NOW WE'LL GO FOR A RIDE
HaqOVTah7bE_9 0 AGAIN THIS IS GOING TO DEVELOP POWER AND EXPLOSIVENESS BY PULLING WEIGHT BEHIND US
HaqOVTah7bE_10 0 THAT'S A LOT OF WEIGHT
HaqOVTah7bE_11 0 BUT AGAIN THE TWO EXERCISES WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY WERE THE STEP UPS ONE LEG AND OUR SLED PULL
HaqOVTah7bE_12 0 DOING THOSE TWO EXERCISES WILL HELP INCREASE YOUR SPEED AND YOUR POWER AND IT WILL DEFINITELY MAKE YOU RUN FASTER
HaqOVTah7bE_13 0 MY NAME IS OTIS HAVE A GOOD DAY
HIK53Hm2DpI_1 0 LET'S DECONSTRUCT A HAND THAT HAS ALL LOW CARDS BUT CAN STILL WIN THE HIGH
HIK53Hm2DpI_2 0 AS A MATTER A FACT IF YOU HAVE ALL LOW CARDS YOU CAN STILL WIN THE HIGH
HIK53Hm2DpI_3 0 YOU CAN STILL GET HELP FROM THE BOARD IT'S ACTUALLY BETTER OFTEN TO HAVE ALL LOW CARDS CAUSE YOU CAN TAKE THE HIGH
HIK53Hm2DpI_4 0 IF YOU HAVE ALL HIGH CARDS YOU CAN BE EXCLUDED FROM THE LOW SO HAVING ALL HIGH AND LOW CARDS IS ALL KIND OF A WASH
HIK53Hm2DpI_5 0 HERE WE GOT THREE AND DEUCES AND THREE DEUCES SUITED DOUBLE SUITED
HIK53Hm2DpI_6 0 EITHER WAY IT'S A HAND WORTH SEEING IN A FLOP WITH USUALLY IN OMAHA HIGH LOW YOU WANT TO GO WITH THE FLOP WITH AN ACE IN YOUR HAND A ACE OR A TWO OR ACE THREE FOUR AND OR A FIVE
HIK53Hm2DpI_7 0 BUT IF YOU GO WITH THREES AND TWO IF AN ACE COMES ON THE BOARD YOU ARE ACTUALLY IN THE DRIVER SEAT TO TAKE THE NUT LOW
HIK53Hm2DpI_8 0 YOU ARE SUDDENLY IN BETTER SHAPE THAN SOMEONE WHO HOLDS ACE TWO
HIK53Hm2DpI_9 0 IN ADDITION YOU CAN WIN THE HIGH IF YOU CATCH A THREE OR TWO THREE'S OR IF YOU CATCH A COUPLE OF TWO'S
HIK53Hm2DpI_10 0 NOW IF THE FLOP COMES AND YOU MAKE A SET LET'S SAY THREE TWOS BE CAUTIOUS BECAUSE IN ALL TYPES OF OMAHA REGULAR OMAHA HIGH LOW
HIK53Hm2DpI_11 0 IF YOU CATCH A SET OR A LOW SET YOU ARE VERY LIKELY UP AGAINST A BETTER SET ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE PLAYING AT A TABLE OF EIGHT OR NINE PLAYERS
HIK53Hm2DpI_12 0 SO DEFINITELY SEE A FLOP WITH THREES AND TWO BUT DON'T PLAY THEM LIKE THEY ARE THE STONE NUTS
Gl5UYe25Bmg_1 0 I'M DR JOE NEELY AND I PRACTICE WITH THE BARTON OAKS DENTAL GROUP
Gl5UYe25Bmg_2 0 I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE TYPES OF PARTIAL DENTURES AND WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE
Gl5UYe25Bmg_3 0 YOU CAN HAVE AN ACRYLIC OR PLASTIC SUPPORTED PARTIAL DENTURE
Gl5UYe25Bmg_4 0 OFTEN CALLED A FLIPPER
Gl5UYe25Bmg_5 0 AND THEY'RE CONSISTED OF PLASTIC AND THEY'RE SOMEWHAT GUM COLORED
Gl5UYe25Bmg_6 0 AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE TEETH THAT ARE IN THEM
Gl5UYe25Bmg_7 0 THE LITTLE SCALLOPS OR THE AREAS THAT REST AGAINST THE TEETH FOR SUPPORT
Gl5UYe25Bmg_8 0 YOU HAVE A MORE TRADITIONAL PARTIAL DENTURE THAT HAS A METAL FRAMEWORK
Gl5UYe25Bmg_9 0 AND HAS ARMS THAT HOLD THE PARTIAL IN PLACE
Gl5UYe25Bmg_10 0 WITH A LITTLE RECEDES AND THEN THE REPLACEMENT TEETH
Gl5UYe25Bmg_11 0 WHERE THERE AREN'T REPLACEMENT TEETH ON BOTH SIDES
Gl5UYe25Bmg_12 0 THEY OFTEN HAVE PLASTIC SKIRT AROUND THE DENTURE
Gl5UYe25Bmg_13 0 YOU ALSO WOULD HAVE THE OPTION OF HAVING A PARTIAL THAT'S IMPLANT SUPPORTING
Gl5UYe25Bmg_14 0 THE SUPPORT FOR THE PARTIAL WOULD BE IN THE BONE
Gl5UYe25Bmg_15 0 AND INSIDE YOUR DENTURE
Gl5UYe25Bmg_16 0 AND PARTIAL OR COMPLETE
Gl5UYe25Bmg_17 0 AND THAT WOULD SNAP DOWN
HbQDnZ3-X3I_1 0 ANOTHER PASS THAT YOU WANT TO KEEP IN YOUR REPERTOIRE IS THE OVERHEAD PASS
HbQDnZ3-X3I_2 0 THE OVERHEAD PASS IS EFFECTIVE DURING THE GAME WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF SPACE BETWEEN YOU AND THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PASS IT TO AND YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO GET IT THERE WITH SOME ZIP SO THAT THE DEFENSE DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO GET IN BETWEEN AND TRY TO STEAL THE BALL
HbQDnZ3-X3I_3 0 THE IMPORTANT THING WITH THE OVERHEAD PASS IS YOU WANT TO IT'S EXACTLY LIKE THE PASS IS CALLED YOU WANT TO COME OVER THE HEAD
HbQDnZ3-X3I_4 0 SO YOU COME OVER THE HEAD AND WHEN YOU PASS IT JUST AS ANY OTHER PASS YOU WANT TO STEP INTO THE PASS
HbQDnZ3-X3I_5 0 SO WHEN YOU COME YOU WANT TO COME OVER THE HEAD COME DOWN STEP INTO THE PASS AND YOU SEE HOW MY HANDS ARE FACING MY MAN
HbQDnZ3-X3I_6 0 SO WHEN YOU PASS YOUR HANDS NEED TO FACE YOUR MAN WHEN YOU'RE COMPLETE WITH THE PASS
HbQDnZ3-X3I_7 0 THAT'S CALLED FOLLOW THROUGH
HbQDnZ3-X3I_8 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE CATCHING ALSO JUST LIKE THE OTHER PASSES YOU WANT TO STEP INTO YOUR CATCH
HbQDnZ3-X3I_9 0 SO CATCHES IT AND IMMEDIATELY IF I SEE ANOTHER MAN THAT I WANT TO PASS IT TO I HIT HIM WITH THE OVERHEAD PASS STEPPING INTO THE THROW
HbQDnZ3-X3I_10 0 JUST SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU CAN KEEP KIND OF KEEP IN YOUR REPERTOIRE WHENEVER YOU'RE LOOKING AT A MAN THAT'S QUITE A DISTANCE FROM YOU AND YOU WANT TO PASS IT TO HIM WITHOUT THE DEFENSE COMING IN AND TRYING TO STEAL IT
HbQDnZ3-X3I_11 0 SO KEEP THAT IN MIND WHENEVER YOU'RE PLAYING BALL THE OVERHEAD PASS IS REALLY EFFECTIVE
_gpcnKxs_RI_2 0 I'M KATIE AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PLAY THE HORN WHILE STANDING
_gpcnKxs_RI_3 0 NOW FOR MANY PEOPLE ITS UNNATURAL TO TRY TO PLAY A HORN WHILE STANDING BECAUSE FROM A EARLY AGE HORN PLAYERS ARE ALWAYS THOUGHT TO KEEP THERE BELL ON THERE THIGH WHEN THE ARE SITTING DOWN
_gpcnKxs_RI_4 0 BUT FOR RECITALS YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAND TO HAVE GREATER STAGE PRESENCE OR IN SOME PIECES OF MUSIC THERE WOULD ACTUALLY BE DIRECTION CALLED HORNS UP
_gpcnKxs_RI_5 0 WHICH YOU HAVE LIFT THE BELL UP OFF OF YOUR THIGH SO LET ME JUST SHOW YOU HOW THIS IS DONE
_gpcnKxs_RI_6 0 I WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO IT STANDING
_gpcnKxs_RI_7 0 FIRST OF ALL YOU WILL SEE I GOT THIS MODIFICATION FOR MY HORN AND YOU COULD GET ALSO
_gpcnKxs_RI_8 0 IT IS BASICALLY A SMALL SHELF TO GIVE ADDED SUPPORT WITH THE LEFT HAND BUT EVEN WITHOUT THIS YOU COULD CAN PLAY STANDING UP AND THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE THE WAY THAT YOU HAVE YOUR HAND ON THE BELL
_gpcnKxs_RI_9 0 NORMALLY WHEN YOU ARE SITTING DOWN YOU HAVE IT ALMOST DIRECTLY AGAINST THE SIDE MAYBE SLIGHTLY DOWN
_gpcnKxs_RI_10 0 WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO WHEN YOU ARE STANDING IS GO AHEAD AND LIFT IT SO IT IS UP ON TOP
_gpcnKxs_RI_11 0 NOW ALL OF SUDDEN YOUR BELL IS RESTING ON SOMETHING IT IS RESTING ON THE BACK OF YOUR HAND
_gpcnKxs_RI_12 0 ONCE YOU DO THAT IT IS JUST AS SIMPLE AS ALWAYS YOU HAVE YOUR ELBOW OUT YOU COULD FEEL FREE TO MOVE AROUND AND BE EXPRESSIVE AS YOU PLAY TO SOME EXTENT AND YOU WILL FIND MUCH THE SAME AS HORN PLAYING
GQIFum4B_n8_1 0 HI MY NAME IS LANIE MCCORMICK I'M A FINE ART PHOTOGRAPHER IN AUSTIN TEXAS
GQIFum4B_n8_2 0 I'M HERE TO SHOW YOU HOW TO SET UP A DARK ROOM ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GQIFum4B_n8_3 0 WHEN CHOOSING AN ENLARGER IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT YOUR NEEDS
GQIFum4B_n8_4 0 WHEN YOUR PRINTING COLOR OR IN BLACK AND WHITE
GQIFum4B_n8_5 0 ALSO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT SIZE PRINTS YOU LIKE TO MAKE EIGHT X TEN OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRINT SOMETHING LARGER LIKE A SIXTEEN X TWENTY
GQIFum4B_n8_6 0 IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTICE YOUR LENS WILL YOU BE USING 35MM NEGATIVES IF YOU ARE YOU NEED A 50MM LENS
GQIFum4B_n8_7 0 IF YOU ARE PRINTING MEDIUM FORMATS SAY A SIX X SIX NEGATIVE YOU'RE GOING TO WANT A 8MM LENS
GQIFum4B_n8_8 0 IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR LENSES ARE REALLY NICE WORKS GREAT AND IT'S THE RIGHT SIZE
GQIFum4B_n8_9 0 FROM THERE YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT AN EASEL AN EASEL IS GOING TO HOLD YOUR PAPER SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD BE A FIVE X SEVEN OR SAY EVEN SMALLER LIKE A POSTCARD SIZE PRINT
G63nAhglHSw_1 0 HI I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF COLLARS
G63nAhglHSw_2 0 WE CAN FIND MANY DIFFERENT KINDS IN THE STORE AND IT CAN BE A BIG PROBLEM OF WHAT MIGHT WORK BEST FOR YOUR DOG
G63nAhglHSw_3 0 THIS IS CALLED THE MARTINGALE COLLAR AND THIS ONE HAS A CHAIN ON IT SO THAT THE DOG MAY REACT TO THE SOUND
G63nAhglHSw_4 0 BUT ONLY CLOSES TO A CERTAIN DEGREE WITHOUT GETTING ANY TIGHTER ON THE DOG
G63nAhglHSw_5 0 IT ALSO WORKS VERY WELL WITH ANY TYPE OF DOG LIKE COLLIER GREYHOUND WHO MAY SLIDE BACKWARDS AND GET OUT OF THEIR COLLAR CAUSE IT WILL TIGHTEN AND BECOME A BECOME A TIGHTER ON THE DOG WHERE THEY CAN'T ESCAPE
G63nAhglHSw_6 0 SO THIS ONE IS GOOD FOR THAT TYPE OF SITUATION
G63nAhglHSw_7 0 IF YOU HAVE A PINCHER COLLAR AND THIS MAY LOOK MEDIEVAL BUT IT CAN BE A GOOD TOOL FOR YOUR DOG IF YOU FIND WITH THIS FOR DOING LOTS AND LOTS OF CORRECTIONS
G63nAhglHSw_8 0 IF THAT'S THE CASE YOU MAY NEED TO GO TO MORE WHAT WE CALL A VERSO TYPE COLLAR WHICH IS THIS
G63nAhglHSw_9 0 THESE COLLARS ALONE DON'T TRAIN YOUR DOG YOU SHOULD RECEIVE INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTION FROM A TRAINER IN YOUR AREA TO ENSURE THAT YOU'RE USING IT CORRECTLY
G63nAhglHSw_10 0 COUNT HOW MANY TIMES YOU'RE GIVEN CORRECTIONS TO YOUR DOG AND THAT MAY INDICATE A CHANGE IN TOOLS
H8ZvwLX7-kM_1 0 HI I'M STEPHANIE BARNETT
H8ZvwLX7-kM_2 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M HERE TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE THIS GORGEOUS CHRISTMAS TABLE FOR YOUR CHRISTMAS DINNER
H8ZvwLX7-kM_3 0 AS A GOOD HOST OR HOSTESS IT'S REALLY GREAT TO HAVE LITTLE GIFTS AND LITTLE SURPRISES ON THE TABLE FOR YOUR GUESTS
H8ZvwLX7-kM_4 0 AT CHRISTMAS ONE REALLY GREAT THING IS A CHRISTMAS CRACKER
H8ZvwLX7-kM_5 0 THESE ARE FILLED WITH A LITTLE PAPER HAT A JOKE A LITTLE TOY OR SOMETHING SPECIAL AND YOU JUST TAKE THEM WITH YOUR NEIGHBOR AND YOU EACH HOLD IT IN AND PULL
H8ZvwLX7-kM_6 0 THEY MAKE A LOUD POPPING NOISE AND ALL THE GIFTS COME TUMBLING OUT AND EVERYONE COULD WEAR THEIR PAPER HATS AND IT'S VERY FUN
H8ZvwLX7-kM_7 0 SO I LIKE TO PUT A LITTLE CHRISTMAS CRACKER AT THE TOP OF EVERYONES PLACE SETTINGS
H8ZvwLX7-kM_8 0 YOU ALSO MIGHT WANT TO HAVE LITTLE BAGS OF COOKIES OR CANDIES OR EVEN A LITTLE SPECIAL GIFT AT EVERYONE'S PLACE JUST TO MAKE THEM FEEL VERY SPECIAL FOR THE HOLIDAYS
H8ZvwLX7-kM_9 0 YOU CAN EVEN COORDINATE YOUR WRAPPING PAPER TO MATCH YOUR TABLE AS I HAD DONE HERE
h8Zj6qHmTj8_1 0 THIS IS AN IMPROV GAME CALLED GROUP COUNT
h8Zj6qHmTj8_2 0 THIS IS A GAME THAT IS A REALLY GOOD AT WORKING WITH FOCUS AND GROUP MIND
h8Zj6qHmTj8_3 0 IT'S NOT SO MUCH A FUN CRAZY WILD GAME AS IT IS REALLY A GAME ABOUT CONNECTION PACING AND GROUP MIND
h8Zj6qHmTj8_4 0 SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU GET EVERYBODY IN THE GROUP IN A CIRCLE KIND OF CLOSE LIKE SHOULDER TO SHOULDER
h8Zj6qHmTj8_5 0 AND THEN I HAVE EVERYBODY KIND OF SOFTEN THERE EYE FOCUS
h8Zj6qHmTj8_6 0 MAYBE THEY WANT TO CLOSE THEIR EYES MAYBE THEY JUST WANT TO LOOK DOWN AT PEOPLES SHOES MAYBE THEY JUST WANT TO HAVE A SOFT FOCUS WITH THEIR EYES
h8Zj6qHmTj8_7 0 AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IS THEY'RE GOING TO BE COUNTING UP FROM ONE
h8Zj6qHmTj8_8 0 AND THEY'RE GOING TO SEE HOW HIGH THEY CAN COUNT ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SO ON AND SO FORTH SEE WHAT NUMBER THEY CAN REACH AS A GROUP
h8Zj6qHmTj8_9 0 NOW THE RULES ARE NO ONE PERSON CAN SAY TWO NUMBERS IN A ROW
h8Zj6qHmTj8_10 0 SO IF I SAY ONE SOMEONE ELSE IN THE GROUP HAS TO SAY TWO
h8Zj6qHmTj8_11 0 ALSO YOU CAN'T CREATE ANY PATTERNS SO WE CAN'T JUST GO AROUND IN A CIRCLE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
h8Zj6qHmTj8_12 0 IT HAS TO BE ORGANIC ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX IT HAS TO BE DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND NO NO SPECIFIC PATTERN
h8Zj6qHmTj8_13 0 AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS NO TWO PEOPLE CAN TALK AT THE SAME TIME
h8Zj6qHmTj8_14 0 IF TWO PEOPLE TALK AT THE SAME TIME SAY THE SAME NUMBER AT THE SAME TIME OR EVEN START TO SAY THE SAME NUMBER AT THE SAME TIME YOU BEGIN BACK AT ONE
h8Zj6qHmTj8_15 0 SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT THAT GROUP MIND OF KNOWING WHEN IS IT YOUR TURN TO GO AND REALLY FEELING THAT INSTINCT AND GOING ON IT AND KNOWING WHEN IT'S TIME TO HANG BACK AND LET OTHER PEOPLE PARTICIPATE
h8Zj6qHmTj8_16 0 SO YOU GET EVERYBODY IN THE GROUP TAKE A NICE BREATH AND YOU BEGIN COUNTING ONE TWO THREE
h8Zj6qHmTj8_17 0 SO IF YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE SAY THREE START BACK AT ONE TWO THREE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH
h8Zj6qHmTj8_18 0 AND THEN USUALLY TRY AND SEE HOW HIGH YOU CAN GO
h8Zj6qHmTj8_19 0 SOME GROUPS AT THE BEGINNING THEY MIGHT JUST GET TO A FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN GROUPS THAT ARE REALLY GOOD THAT HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR A LONG TIME GET TO OVER 100
h8Zj6qHmTj8_20 0 IT'S A GOOD MEASURE OF HOW IN-SINK YOUR GROUP IS HOW HIGH YOU CAN GET WITH THIS GAME
h8Zj6qHmTj8_21 0 NOW THIS GAME CAN BE A LITTLE FRUSTRATING AT TIMES I WANT TO WARN YOU ABOUT THAT
h8Zj6qHmTj8_22 0 IF YOU SENSE THE GROUP GETTING FRUSTRATED OR OR UPSET OR TIRED TAKE A TIME OUT
h8Zj6qHmTj8_23 0 LET THE IT'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO DEBRIEF AND SEE WHAT'S COMING UP WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE GROUP WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE MAKE IT DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE GROUPS GOING TO MESS UP A LOT ON STAGE AND WE NEED TO PRACTICE HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT
h8Zj6qHmTj8_24 0 SO THAT'S A IT'S A GOOD EXERCISE FOR GROUP MIND FOR GROUP FOCUS TO GET PEOPLE SETTLED DOWN CONNECTED AND REALLY LISTENING TO THE GROUP AND IT'S CALLED GROUP COUNT
GpkmlwtEoTk_1 0 JOHN VANDEBROOKE THIS IS JOHN VANDEBROOKE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GpkmlwtEoTk_2 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ADVANCED ENCAUSTIC PAINTING
GpkmlwtEoTk_3 0 OKAY JUST TAKE A LOOK AT WORKING ON A PANCAKE GRIDDLE AGAIN
GpkmlwtEoTk_4 0 HERE'S TWO IMAGES THAT WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT
GpkmlwtEoTk_5 0 ON BOTH OF THEM YOU'LL NOTICE THE BACKGROUND HAS BEEN SOFTENED BY USING KLEENEX TO DAB THE WAX WHEN IT WAS ON THE PANCAKE GRIDDLE
GpkmlwtEoTk_6 0 NOW ON ONE OF THESE ON THE RIGHT IT IS DRAWN A LOT WITH THE WAX DIRECTLY IN BLOCK FORM ON THE PAPER ITSELF
GpkmlwtEoTk_7 0 ON THE OTHER PAINTING A LOT OF THAT OF WHAT I CALL IRIS IS THOSE FLOWERS WERE DONE WITH THE IRON INSTEAD OF I TOOK IT OFF THE GRIDDLE AND THEN WORKED WITH AN IRON TO CREATE THOSE FLOWERS
GpkmlwtEoTk_8 0 BUT LET'S JUST TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THAT WAX BEHAVES ON THE GRIDDLE
GpkmlwtEoTk_9 0 WHEN THE PAPER IS HOT ON A GRIDDLE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TOUCH THAT WAX BLOCK YOU SEE AND YOU CAN DIRECTLY PAINT WITH THE WAX
GpkmlwtEoTk_10 0 AND AGAIN AS I SAID ON SOME OF THOSE PAINTINGS WE SOFTEN THE BACKGROUND BY DABBING IT WITH KLEENEX
GpkmlwtEoTk_11 0 I'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO GET EFFECTS BY TAKING SOME OF THE WAX PUTTING IT RIGHT ON THE GRIDDLE OVER HERE
GpkmlwtEoTk_12 0 MAYBE STICKING SOMETHING LIKE AN OLD RUBBERY ERASER IN IT LIKE THAT AND USING THAT TO DRAW WITH
GpkmlwtEoTk_13 0 ANOTHER THING THAT YOU CAN USE ARE THESE SOFT THEY'RE SOLD IN CRAFT STORES TO ACTUALLY MAKE RUBBER STAMPS OUT OF THEM BY HEATING A METAL OBJECT AND PUSHING IT ON THERE UNTIL IT FORMS AN IMAGE
GpkmlwtEoTk_14 0 BUT I'VE USED THEM AGAIN PUTTING SOME WAX LET'S SAY ON THE GRIDDLE DABBING THAT IN THAT CREATING PATTERNS LIKE THAT
GpkmlwtEoTk_15 0 I ALSO LOVE CORKS
GpkmlwtEoTk_16 0 CORKS ARE GREAT THING TO AFTER YOU'VE DRANK THE WINE TAKE THE CORK AND MAKE SOME IMAGES
GpkmlwtEoTk_17 0 AND YOU CAN CARVE WITH THE KNIFE IN THE CORK CREATE DIFFERENT EFFECTS
GpkmlwtEoTk_18 0 SO THIS JUST OPENS UP A WHOLE WORLD OF POSSIBILITIES
GpkmlwtEoTk_19 0 ANOTHER THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TAKE YOUR WAX AND TAKE SOMETHING LIKE A CARD AND JUST CREATE IMAGES BY MOVING A CARD ON THE SURFACE
hfWwL63RtJo_1 0 HI I'M HEATH HEINE WITH CLEARVIEW WINDSHIELD REPAIR HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
hfWwL63RtJo_2 0 IN THIS CLIP YOU ARE GOING TO SEE HOW TO REPAIR A CLAMSHELL BREAK IN YOUR WINDSHIELD
hfWwL63RtJo_3 0 OKAY NOW WE ARE GOING TO DO A REPAIR ON A CLAMSHELL
hfWwL63RtJo_4 0 A CLAMSHELL IS JUST LIKE THE REVERSE OF A CLAMSHELL BUT IT IS IN THE GLASS THIS WAY LIKE A CLAM WOULD LEAVE IN THE SAND
hfWwL63RtJo_5 0 SO NOW THAT IS KNOCKED OUT OF THE GLASS
hfWwL63RtJo_6 0 MOST CASES THE CLAMSHELL DOESN'T EFFECT THE WINDSHIELD AS FAR AS CRACKING OUT OR ANYTHING BUT IT IS UNSIGHTLY
hfWwL63RtJo_7 0 IT IS A DIP IN THE GLASS AND IT CAN MESS UP YOUR WIPER BLADES
hfWwL63RtJo_8 0 SO WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS ONE INSTEAD OF DRILLING DIRECTLY IN YOU WANT TO COLOR IN THE CLAMSHELL PART
hfWwL63RtJo_9 0 SO YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE YOUR DRILL EVER SO EASY COLORING THAT IN
hfWwL63RtJo_10 0 NOW THAT YOU HAVE ROUGHED UP ALL THE GLASS ON THAT SURFACE YOU WILL TAKE SOME JUST REGULAR RESIN DAB THIS ON TAKE SOME PIT RESIN APPLY YOUR PATCH AND MAKE SURE YOU ARE GETTING OUT ALL OF THE AIR BUBBLES SO MOSTLY TH PIT RESIN IS JUST SITTING THERE ON THE GLASS
hfWwL63RtJo_11 0 AFTER THIS CURES YOU WILL SCRAPE THIS OFF WITH YOUR RAZOR BLADE AND NOW YOU HAVE A SMOOTH SURFACE ACROSS THE GLASS
hfWwL63RtJo_12 0 JUST WIPE IT DOWN AND POLISH OUT AND YOU WILL BE DONE
gtSU_L5xhzM_1 0 THIS IS KYLE WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT SOME TIPS FOR SONY ACID PRO
gtSU_L5xhzM_2 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THE EXTREME
gtSU_L5xhzM_3 0 SO YOU GRAB IT RIGHT CLICK IT PULL IT OVER
gtSU_L5xhzM_4 0 I'M GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY UP TO 200 WHICH IS THE LIMIT HERE JUST SO THAT YOU COULD FEEL THE DIFFERENCE HERE WHEN YOU SEE THE EXTREME ON THE BEATS PER MINUTE
gtSU_L5xhzM_5 0 A LITTLE BIT NON REALISTIC BUT ANYWAY
gtSU_L5xhzM_6 0 NOW LET'S GO TO THE OTHER EXTREME WHEN YOU GO DOWN TO SEVENTY BEATS PER MINUTE
gtSU_L5xhzM_7 0 NOTICE HOW THE NOISE IS A LITTLE BIT DISTORTED
gtSU_L5xhzM_8 0 NOW TYPICALLY I WOULDN'T GO MORE THAN TEN BEATS PER MINUTE BEYOND WHAT THE ACTUAL CLIP IS JUST BECAUSE IT STARTS TO DISTORT THE ACTUAL SOUND AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT
gtSU_L5xhzM_9 0 WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DOUBLE CLICK THIS HERE IF YOU WANT TO JUST PUT IN YOUR EXACT MEASURE THERE YOU GO 120
gtSU_L5xhzM_10 0 WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO THAT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP IT ON THAT RIGHT NOW
GFttwLutLSY_1 0 HI I'M TIM GIPSON I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW REFRIGERATORS WORK
GFttwLutLSY_2 0 NOW REFRIGERATORS WORK MUCH LIKE AN AIR CONDITIONER ONLY AN AIR CONDITIONER THAT JUST COOLS THE INSIDE OF THE REFRIGERATOR
GFttwLutLSY_3 0 NOW WHAT IT HAS IS IT HAS A CONDENSER MOTOR IN THE BASE OF THE REFRIGERATOR AND IT WILL BE IN THE BACK HERE
GFttwLutLSY_4 0 AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT TAKES A REFRIGERANT AND IT CIRCULATES IT OVER THROUGH SOME EVAPORATOR COILS SO THAT THE HEAT IS RELEASED AND AS THE HEAT IS RELEASED THE REFRIGERANT GETS VERY COLD AND YOU'LL HAVE A FAN SO YOU'LL HEAR YOUR REFRIGERATOR AND ACTUALLY YOU'LL HEAR IT RUNNING AND THERE'S TWO THINGS DOING
GFttwLutLSY_5 0 THERE IS A FAN THAT'S DRAWING SOME AIR IN AND THEN THERE'S ALSO A COMPRESSOR THAT'S TAKING THAT REFRIGERANT AND AS IT GOES THROUGH THE SYSTEM IT'S COMPRESSING IT BACK SO THAT AS IT COMES BACK AND EXPANDS AGAIN IT RELEASES IT'S HEAT BECOMES VERY COLD AND IT CAN ACTUALLY CIRCULATE THROUGH THE REFRIGERATOR AND MAKE THE REFRIGERATOR COLD
GFttwLutLSY_6 0 AND THAT AIR CIRCULATES FROM THE FRONT HERE CIRCULATES THROUGH AND OUT THE BACK AND THEN INSIDE THE REFRIGERATOR AND PARTICULARLY TODAY YOU HAVE A LOT OF ELECTRONIC CONTROLS WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SET THE EXACT TEMPERATURES AND THEN AS THE AIR BLOWS OVER THE COILS AND GETS VERY COLD THEN IT IS BLOWN INTO THE REFRIGERATOR BOX AND KEEPS ACTUALLY COLD AIR CIRCULATING IN HERE TO WHATEVER TEMPERATURE YOU NEED FOR YOUR REFRIGERATOR OR FOR YOUR FREEZER
GFttwLutLSY_7 0 SO I'M TIM GIPSON AND THAT'S HOW A REFRIGERATOR WORKS
h2zYAVKm5zM_1 0 HI I AM STAN DEFREITAS MR GREEN THUMB
h2zYAVKm5zM_2 0 ONE OF THE FAVORITE PLANTS THAT WE HAVE AS AN HERB IS THAT OF DILL
h2zYAVKm5zM_3 0 AND WE ALL LOVE DILL PICKLES BUT YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THAT YOU CAN EASILY GROW DILL IN YOUR OWN BACK YARD GARDEN
h2zYAVKm5zM_4 0 IT'S A PLANT THAT ACTUALLY GETS TO BE FAIRLY LARGE
h2zYAVKm5zM_5 0 NOW YOU'LL NORMALLY BUY IT AS A FAIRLY SMALL PLANT TO START OFF AS AS A LITTLE SEEDLING OR YOU CAN ACTUALLY START IT FROM SEED
h2zYAVKm5zM_6 0 IT WILL USUALLY START IN PROBABLY ABOUT IN TWO TO THREE WEEKS
h2zYAVKm5zM_7 0 YOU CAN PUT IT IN A PEAT PEARL LIKE COMBINATION
h2zYAVKm5zM_8 0 REMEMBER THAT DILL LIKES A GOOD AMOUNT OF LIGHT
h2zYAVKm5zM_9 0 SO DON'T PUT IT IN THE SHADIEST SPOT OF YOUR YARD OR GARDEN
h2zYAVKm5zM_10 0 ALSO MAKE SURE IT HAS A GOOD SOURCE OF WATER
h2zYAVKm5zM_11 0 NOW THE DILL CAN BE USED IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS
h2zYAVKm5zM_12 0 WE THINK OF DILL PICKLES BUT ALSO YOU COULD CUT FRESH DILL AND USE IT WITH POTATOES AND MANY OTHER DISHES AS WELL
h2zYAVKm5zM_13 0 SOMETIMES FISH SOMETIMES PORK ALSO
h2zYAVKm5zM_14 0 WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DILL MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE IT IN AN AREA WHERE YOU CAN KEEP IT MOIST
h2zYAVKm5zM_15 0 MAKE SURE IT GETS ABOUT SIX HOURS OF BRIGHT SUN A DAY

g6DYg1m3XQs_1 0 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE HEAD NOD
g6DYg1m3XQs_2 0 MANY INSTRUCTORS WILL SAY INHALE NOD YOUR HEADAND EVERYONE IN THE CLASS GOES
g6DYg1m3XQs_3 0 AND WHAT'S HAPPENING WHEN YOU LOWER YOUR HEAD IN THIS WAY IS THAT YOU'RE LENGTHENING THE MUSCLES IN YOUR NECK RATHER THAN AND TEACHING YOUR HEAD HOW TO FALL FORWARD RATHER THAN INCREASING THE LENGTH IN YOUR SPINE
g6DYg1m3XQs_4 0 SO IN PILATES WHAT WE DO IS CALLED A CHIN TUCK
g6DYg1m3XQs_5 0 AND YOU SIMPLY TUCK YOUR CHIN IN
g6DYg1m3XQs_6 0 AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL THE SPACE INCREASE BETWEEN THE VERTEBRAE IN YOUR NECK
g6DYg1m3XQs_7 0 IT'S ALMOST LIKE GIVING YOURSELF A COUPLE OF CHINS
g6DYg1m3XQs_8 0 SO YOUR CHIN DOES COME DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND KIND OF DOUBLES HERE
g6DYg1m3XQs_9 0 AND WHEN YOU GO DOWN YOU HOLD THAT POSITION SO THE MUSCLES ARE LEARNING TO SUPPORT THE HEAD IN THE PROPER POSTURE FOR EVEN STANDING AND SITTING IN THE OFFICE
g6DYg1m3XQs_10 0 THE NEXT THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE PROPER HEAD ALIGNMENT WHEN YOU'RE LAYING DOWN ON THE MAT
g6DYg1m3XQs_11 0 BEFORE I LAY DOWN I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOME PROPS THAT ARE ALWAYS HELPFUL TO HAVE AROUND
giZtPi9nATQ_1 0 JOEL SIEGEL ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE GOING TO START OUT WITH THE BASS DRUM
giZtPi9nATQ_2 0 WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE PLAYING ONE QUARTER NOTE AND FOR THIS FIRST ONE WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT ON BEAT ONE
giZtPi9nATQ_4 0 SO THIS IS SIMILAR TO THAT BEAT THAT WE WERE DOING EARLIER BUT INSTEAD OF BEATS ONE AND THREE OR ONE TWO THREE AND FOUR IT'S JUST GOING TO BE ON BEAT ONE
giZtPi9nATQ_5 0 AND AS I'M PLAYING WITH BEAT ONE ON THE KICK BEATS TWO AND FOUR ON THE SNARE AND 8TH NOTES ON THE HI-HAT I WANT YOU TO BE THINKING TRY AND CONCEPTUALIZE WHERE THINGS ARE LINING UP WHICH LIMBS ARE GOING TO BE LINING UP WITH EACH OTHER AND ON WHICH BEAT ALL RIGHT
giZtPi9nATQ_6 0 SO HERE'S WE'RE GOING TO SPEED IT TAKE THE TEMPO UP JUST A LITTLE BIT FROM WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING
giZtPi9nATQ_7 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE AT EIGHTY FOR ALL THESE BEATS ALL RIGHT
giZtPi9nATQ_8 0 SO HERE'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE
giZtPi9nATQ_9 0 AND REMEMBER TRY AND CONCEPTUALIZE WHERE EVERYTHING IS LINING UP
giZtPi9nATQ_10 0 ALL RIGHT SO THAT WAS ENOUGH TIME HOPEFULLY FOR YOU TO KINDA GET A FEEL OF AT LEAST A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE LINING UP
giZtPi9nATQ_11 0 JUST LIKE BEFORE YOU HAVE THE TWO AND FOUR ON YOUR TWO HANDS ONE AND TWO AND THREE AND FOUR AND AND THEN WITH THE KICK YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE THAT ONE ASPECT LINING UP AND IT'S GOING TO BE WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND AND YOUR RIGHT FOOT AND THAT'S ONE AND TWO AND THREE AND FOUR AND ONE
giZtPi9nATQ_12 0 THAT'S WHERE YOU SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT AS FAR AS YOUR LIMBS LINING UP
g4eLLh5A8g4_1 0 HI I'M JAMES DIX FROM SALT LAKE CITY UTAH
g4eLLh5A8g4_2 0 I'M THE OWNER AND FOUNDER OF REPTILE RESCUE SERVICE
g4eLLh5A8g4_3 0 WE'RE DISCUSSING WHAT TO FEED A TURTLE
g4eLLh5A8g4_4 0 THIS WILL BE ON DEPENDING UPON WHAT SPECIES YOU HAVE
g4eLLh5A8g4_5 0 SO I'LL GIVE YOU A COUPLE EXAMPLES REAL QUICK
g4eLLh5A8g4_6 0 IF YOU HAVE A DESERT SPECIES USUALLY THEY'LL WIND UP EATING PRICKLY PEAR FRUIT FROM A CACTUS BEAVER TAIL CACTUS
g4eLLh5A8g4_7 0 THEY DO LIKE A MIXTURE OF GREENS
g4eLLh5A8g4_9 0 LETTUCE DOES NOT HAVE ANY NUTRITIONAL VALUE FOR TURTLES OR IGUANAS
g4eLLh5A8g4_10 0 A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT DOES
g4eLLh5A8g4_11 0 YOU CANNOT JUST GIVE EM LETTUCE
g4eLLh5A8g4_12 0 YOU NEED TO GIVE EM SHREDDED SQUASH CARROTS ZUCCHINI CROOK-NECK SQUASH DANDELIONS MIXED GREENS THEY LOVE ALL THIS
g4eLLh5A8g4_13 0 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
g4eLLh5A8g4_14 0 AND YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO GIVE EM CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTS WITH D3 ON IT
g4eLLh5A8g4_15 0 IF IT'S AN AQUATIC TURTLE A LOT OF THEM EAT EARTHWORMS
g4eLLh5A8g4_16 0 THEY EAT GOLD FISH IN THE WATER
g4eLLh5A8g4_17 0 THEY'LL EAT PINKIE MICE PINKIE RATS
g4eLLh5A8g4_18 0 THEY COULD BE FROZEN DEAD
g4eLLh5A8g4_19 0 JUST PUT EM IN THE WATER AND THEY'LL EAT IT
g4eLLh5A8g4_20 0 AND THEY WILL EAT ALSO CANNED DOG FOOD BUT GIVE IT TO THEM VERY IN SMALL AMOUNTS
GKT4O5DLkZI_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS DUANE CARTER AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT BAND CONDUCTING
GKT4O5DLkZI_2 0 REGARDLESS OF THE PERSON WHO STANDS IN FRONT OF THE CONCERT BAND OR ORCHESTRA THE STAGE BAND OR CHOIR WAVING HIS OR HER ARMS THIS IS THE CONDUCTOR
GKT4O5DLkZI_3 0 THE CONDUCTOR'S MAIN JOB IS TO INTERPRET THE MUSIC AND TO HELP THE ENSEMBLE REALIZE THESE IDEAS FOR PERFORMANCE
GKT4O5DLkZI_4 0 THOUGH THERE ARE MANY PROCESSES INVOLVED TO REACH THIS FINAL OUTCOME THERE ARE TWO ASPECTS OF THIS JOB THAT ARE RECOGNIZABLE TO MOST OF US
GKT4O5DLkZI_5 0 AND THAT IS KEEPING TIME AND SHAPING THE MUSIC
GKT4O5DLkZI_6 0 THESE TWO ASPECTS WILL BE THE CENTRAL FOCUS OF THESE VIDEOS
GKT4O5DLkZI_7 0 IN THIS SERIES OF VIDEOS YOU WILL LEARN THE BASICS OF CONDUCTING
GKT4O5DLkZI_8 0 I WILL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HISTORY
GKT4O5DLkZI_9 0 BRIEFLY DISCUSS THE TWO MAIN STYLES OF CONDUCTING
GKT4O5DLkZI_10 0 AND I WILL DEMONSTRATE THE CONDUCTING PATTERNS AND TECHNIQUES NEEDED TO BE A CONDUCTOR
hfryrDUbkho_1 0 HI THIS IS BRUCE LESSELS FROM ZOAR OUTDOOR FOR EXPERTVILLAGE.COM TALKING ABOUT CAMPING
hfryrDUbkho_2 0 SO DEPENDING ON HOW FAR AWAY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WALK TO GET TO YOUR CAMPSITE OR HOW MUCH SUPPORT YOU HAVE GETTING TO YOUR CAMPSITE IF YOU HAVE A VEHICLE NEARBY OR A CANOE NEARBY YOU MAY CHOOSE LIGHT WEIGHT COOK GEAR OR YOU MAY CHOOSE TO BRING MORE EXTRAVAGANT COOK GEAR AND EAT A LITTLE BETTER
hfryrDUbkho_3 0 THINGS SUCH AS POTS THAT ARE EITHER ALUMINUM OR AGAIN IF YOU'RE NOT TOO FAR FROM YOUR CAR OR FROM YOUR BOAT STEEL CAN WORK FINE TOO OR YOU MIGHT BRING YOUR COFFEE PRESS TO MAKE WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND VARIOUS KINDS OF COOK STOVES AND OTHER COOKING GEAR
hfryrDUbkho_4 0 SO THERE ARE VARIOUS DIFFERENT TYPES OF COOK SETS YOU CAN GET FOR CAMPING
hfryrDUbkho_5 0 YOU CAN GET POTS THAT NEST IN WITH EACH OTHER AND A LOT OF THESE HAVE SORT OF INTERVAL POT GRIPS THAT ARE GOING TO KEEP THE POT GRIP COOL WHILE THE POT IS OVER THE FIRE
hfryrDUbkho_6 0 YOU CAN ALSO GET PANS THAT HAVE SEPARATE POT GRIPS AND THIS KIND OF POT GRIP IS COMMON THAT JUST ALLOWS YOU TO LATCH ONTO ANY PAN AND PICK IT UP WITHOUT BURNING YOUR HANDS
hfryrDUbkho_7 0 YOUR MEALS ARE ONLY LIMITED BY YOUR IMAGINATION AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE ALMOST ANYTHING YOU CAN MAKE AT HOME WHEN YOU'RE OUT CAMPING
gYEu3I1MDeo_1 0 DOWN HERE WHAT I HAVE FOR YOU I'VE GOT THERE'S FUR UP HERE ON THE WOOD
gYEu3I1MDeo_2 0 I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU CAN QUITE SEE IT BUT THIS IS CAUSED FROM THE POWER WASHING
gYEu3I1MDeo_3 0 THE POWER WASHING RIPS THIS FUR UP ON THE WOOD AND LEAVES IT SITTING THERE
gYEu3I1MDeo_4 0 IF YOU STAIN IT IN THIS STATE YOU ARE GOING TO GET ALL THAT FUR AREA THERE AND AS THAT WEATHERS OFF YOU'LL GET BLOTCHINESS IN YOUR STAIN AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT
gYEu3I1MDeo_5 0 SO ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS JUST TAKE A QUICK SAND BRICK TAKE IT UP AND DOWN AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET THE WHOLE SURFACE AREA AND THAT IS REALLY ALL YOU NEED TO DO
gYEu3I1MDeo_6 0 YOU CAN DO THAT SPINDLE TO SPINDLE JUST KEEP MOVING AND DO THAT ALL THE WAY AROUND
gYEu3I1MDeo_7 0 NOW THE POWER SANDER TAKES OFF QUITE A BIT MORE AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THAT IN JUST A SECOND
gYEu3I1MDeo_8 0 BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET ALL YOUR SPINDLES ON THE SIDES AND GET YOUR UNDERNEATH SUPPORT BOARDS AND THE ENTIRE HANDRAIL TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE GOT EVERYTHING READY TO GO
hC6U6AD-gGs_1 0 HI I'M STAN DEFREITAS MR GREEN THUMB FOR ON GARDENING
hC6U6AD-gGs_2 0 YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BASIC TO GARDENING IS SAND
hC6U6AD-gGs_3 0 AND SAND OF COURSE WELL IT'S GREAT AND THAT IT'S RELATIVELY STERILE IT'S EASY TO USE AS A POTTING MIX
hC6U6AD-gGs_4 0 MOST OF YOUR SOILS WILL HAVE A CERTAIN CONSISTENCY OF SAND IN IT
hC6U6AD-gGs_5 0 AND THIS OF COURSE IS WHAT YOU WANT TO GET A GOOD BUILDER SAND OR THIS SAND I HAPPEN TO BUY AT A LOCAL NURSERY
hC6U6AD-gGs_6 0 NOW YOU CAN USE WASH BUILDER SAND IF YOU WISH IT'LL WORK FINE
hC6U6AD-gGs_7 0 THERE'S NOT MUCH IN SAND BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH WRONG WITH IT NORMALLY EITHER
hC6U6AD-gGs_8 0 AND WE TALKED ABOUT PROBLEMS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BACTERIA NEMATODES WEED SEEDS THAT OFTEN GET IN SOME OF YOUR BACKYARD SOIL
hC6U6AD-gGs_9 0 IF YOU GET A GOOD WASH BUILDER SAND YOU GOT SOMETHING RELATIVELY STERILE TO START OFF WITH
hC6U6AD-gGs_10 0 REMEMBER THAT THE SAND LETS GOOD AIR MOVEMENT AND IT LETS WATER MOVE THROUGH YOUR SOIL PRETTY WELL AND THAT'S IMPORTANT
hC6U6AD-gGs_11 0 IF YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD DRAINAGE YOUR PLANT WILL PROBABLY DIE
hC6U6AD-gGs_12 0 ALSO OF COURSE INVERSELY IF IT GETS TO DRY IT CAN DIE AS WELL
hC6U6AD-gGs_13 0 SAND IS ONE CONSISTENT PART OF HAVING A GOOD SOIL
hC6U6AD-gGs_14 0 REMEMBER TO PICK UP A GOOD STERILE SOIL AT YOUR LOCAL NURSERY
hC6U6AD-gGs_15 0 FOR ON GARDENING I'M STAN DEFREITAS MR GREEN THUMB
gSiLajKc2Ys_1 0 ALICE MONSAERT THIS STABILITY BALL EXERCISE IS GOING TO TARGET THE OBLIQUES WHICH RUN ON THE SIDE OF THE WAIST
gSiLajKc2Ys_2 0 SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING DOWN TO TRIM DOWN YOUR WAISTLINE THEN THIS IS ONE EXERCISE THAT YOU'D WANT TO INCORPORATE INTO YOUR TRAINING PROGRAM
gSiLajKc2Ys_3 0 I'LL TAKE A KNEELING POSITION AND BEGIN TO PULL THE BALL INTO MY HIP AND PLACE THE HIP ON TOP OF THE BALL THEN LEAN OVER AND I'M JUST PLACED MY HAND AT THE SIDE AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS REDUCE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN MY RIBCAGE AND MY HIP
gSiLajKc2Ys_4 0 SO I'M LIFTING TO THE SIDE
gSiLajKc2Ys_5 0 I'VE GOT GRAVITY COMING DOWN ON THE MUSCLE GROUP AND I'M TRYING TO LIFT MY UPPER BODY AGAINST THE GRAVITY TO CONTRACT THAT MUSCLE
gSiLajKc2Ys_6 0 THIS WOULD BE A LEVEL ONE EXERCISE
gSiLajKc2Ys_7 0 THE ONE THING YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS TRY NOT TO LEAD THE MOVEMENT WITH THE HEAD BUT KEEP THE HEAD IN LINE WITH THE SPINE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN
gSiLajKc2Ys_8 0 TO ADVANCE THE EXERCISE I COME UP ON TO BOTH LEGS SO I'VE ADDED THE BALANCE CHALLENGE PLACE THE HAND BY THE EAR AND AGAIN THE MOVEMENT IS INITIATED FROM THE OBLIQUE MUSCLES ON THE SIDE LIFTING UP
gSiLajKc2Ys_9 0 AND IF I CAN DROP OVER THE BALL EVEN MORE THEN I'M GETTING MORE RANGE OF MOTION AND MORE INTENSITY ON THAT MUSCLE GROUP
gSiLajKc2Ys_10 0 AGAIN A LATERAL SIDE FLEXION TARGET THE OBLIQUES
gPy68q2W3tA_1 0 OKAY ON THIS CLIP WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT GOBOS
gPy68q2W3tA_2 0 GOBOS ARE JUST ABOUT ANY OBJECT THAT YOU CAN USE TO GO BETWEEN A LIGHT AND SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT THE LIGHT TO SHINE ON
gPy68q2W3tA_3 0 THE TERM GOBO ACTUALLY MEANS GO BETWEEN IT'S JUST A SHORT VERSION THAT SOMEBODY IN HOLLYWOOD CAME UP WITH YEARS AGO
gPy68q2W3tA_4 0 SO IF WE'RE PHOTOGRAPHING OUR BEAUTIFUL MODEL HERE AND WE DON'T WANT THIS LIGHT HITTING THIS LENS WHICH CAUSES FLARE AND ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS WE JUST BRING THIS IN THIS ONE'S REALLY KIND OF HANDY ACTUALLY MEANT FOR STUDIO USE AND WE JUST MAKE SURE THAT IS DOESN'T SHOW IN THE VIEWFINDER AND THEN IT BLOCKS THE LIGHT FROM THIS FROM HITTING THE CAMERA
gPy68q2W3tA_5 0 IT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE LIGHT HITTING OUR SUBJECT IT JUST GOES IN BETWEEN THE LIGHT AND THE CAMERA
gPy68q2W3tA_6 0 ALRIGHT WITH THE GOBOS THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY PHOTOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT THAT YOU CAN BUY AND SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON A LOT OF TIMES YOU DON'T REQUIRE SOMETHING OF THIS KIND OF SOPHISTICATION THAT GIVES YOU THIS KIND OF CONTROL TO WHERE YOU CAN BEND IT AT ANY ANGLE AND MOVE IT UP AND DOWN
gPy68q2W3tA_7 0 YOU CAN ACTUALLY JUST COME UP WITH A SHEET OF FOAM CORE USE YOUR A-CLAMP CLAMP IT TO A LIGHT STAND AND YOU STILL HAVE YOUR UP AND DOWN CONTROLS JUST BY TIGHTENING AND LOOSENING THE COLLAR ON THE BACK SIDE AND YOU CAN MOVE THAT RIGHT IN BETWEEN THE LIGHT AND YOUR CAMERA
gPy68q2W3tA_8 0 THE SAME TYPE OF THING A LOT LESS EXPENSE
hI-IRsEQw7E_1 0 HI I'M DEBRAH DEMIRZA
hI-IRsEQw7E_2 0 AND I'M AT DELUXE A RESALE CLOTHING BOUTIQUE IN EUGENE OREGON
hI-IRsEQw7E_3 0 AND TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO REPAIR A HEM
hI-IRsEQw7E_4 0 THIS ONE'S ACTUALLY COME ALL THE WAY OUT
hI-IRsEQw7E_5 0 THE NICE THING ABOUT THIS ONE IS IT ALREADY HAS THE SEAM BINDING AROUND IT TO KEEP THE RAW EDGES FROM FRAYING
hI-IRsEQw7E_6 0 AND WHAT I USUALLY DO IS I START ON THE INSIDE SEAM OF THE PANT LEG SO IT DOESN'T SHOW THAT MUCH
hI-IRsEQw7E_7 0 I AM GOING TO USE A CONTRASTING THREAD JUST SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT I'M DOING HERE
hI-IRsEQw7E_8 0 AND I NEVER START MY SEWING WITH A KNOT I ALWAYS START IT WITH THREE LITTLE LOOPS
hI-IRsEQw7E_9 0 AND I DO IT ON THE PART THAT'S NOT GOING TO SHOW ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PANT
hI-IRsEQw7E_10 0 SO I JUST DO THREE LITTLE LOOPS
hI-IRsEQw7E_11 0 FIRST ONE YOU JUST TAKE A FEW LITTLE THREADS UP AND YOU CAN LEAVE A LITTLE BIT HANGING OFF THE END BECAUSE YOU'LL EVENTUALLY CUT THOSE OFF ANYWAY
hI-IRsEQw7E_12 0 AND THEN THE SECOND LOOP YOU DON'T BRING RIGHT THREW THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST LOOP YOU JUST DO IT CLOSE BY
hI-IRsEQw7E_13 0 OTHERWISE IT WILL PULL YOUR THREAD ALL THE WAY OUT AGAIN
hI-IRsEQw7E_14 0 YOU WANT TO PULL TAUGHT BUT NOT SO TIGHT THAT IT'S GOING TO PULL YOUR THREAD THREW
hI-IRsEQw7E_15 0 I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND CLIP THIS
hI-IRsEQw7E_16 0 AND THEN YOUR THIRD LOOP YOU CAN PUT BACK THREW THE FIRST ONE
hI-IRsEQw7E_17 0 THAT'S GOING TO TOTALLY LOCK IN YOUR THREAD SO IT'S NOT GOING TO GO ANYWHERE
hI-IRsEQw7E_18 0 AND THEN WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IF IT ALREADY HAS THE PRESSING MARK THERE YOU'RE JUST GOING TO START BY GOING THREW A LITTLE TINY BIT OF THE PANTS
hI-IRsEQw7E_19 0 JUST A FEW LITTLE THREADS AND THEN GO UNDERNEATH THE EDGE OF THAT SEAM BINDING ON THE TURNED UP EDGE
hI-IRsEQw7E_20 0 AND THEN JUST CATCH A FEW LITTLE THREADS KIND OF NEAR THAT ON THE PANTS
hI-IRsEQw7E_21 0 AND THEN GO UNDERNEATH THE SEAM BINDING AND CATCH THE TIP OF THE SEAM BINDING
hI-IRsEQw7E_22 0 AND I'M SHOWING YOU OF COURSE YOU'D USE MATCHING THREAD SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE ALL THIS
hI-IRsEQw7E_23 0 AGAIN A FEW LITTLE THREADS
hI-IRsEQw7E_24 0 AND YOU WANT TO USE JUST A FEW LITTLE THREADS FROM YOUR PANTS SO IT DOESN'T SHOW ON THE OTHER SIDE
hI-IRsEQw7E_25 0 AND YOU CAN DO THIS AS CLOSE AS YOU WANT DEPENDING ON THE FABRIC
hI-IRsEQw7E_26 0 SOME FABRIC WILL MOVE SHIFT SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO IT CLOSER
hI-IRsEQw7E_27 0 OTHER FABRIC WON'T BUDGE SO YOU CAN DO IT FURTHER APART
hI-IRsEQw7E_28 0 BUT THE IDEA IS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET A NEAT LINE ON YOUR FABRIC THAT DOESN'T SHOW THROUGH
hI-IRsEQw7E_29 0 SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT FORM THE OTHER SIDE YOU'RE NOT SEEING ANY OF THE STITCHING
hI-IRsEQw7E_30 0 IT'S PRETTY MUCH INVISIBLE
hI-IRsEQw7E_31 0 AND THEN WHEN I END IT I DO THE SAME THREE LITTLE LOOPS
hI-IRsEQw7E_32 0 YOU CAN EITHER DO IT ON THAT SURFACE OR JUST ROLL BACK THE EDGE AND DO YOUR THREE LITTLE LOOPS SO IT DOESN'T SHOW ON YOUR TURNED UP HEM
hI-IRsEQw7E_33 0 AND THEN YOU CAN CLIP YOUR THREAD WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED AND THAT'S HOW YOU MEND A HEM
GZp_u9KvnbA_1 0 ANOTHER THING YOU CAN ADD TO YOUR PHOTO TRANSFER HEADLINES
GZp_u9KvnbA_2 0 NOW HEADLINES ARE DIFFERENT THAN PICTURES WELL I MEAN PICTURES MAY HAVE TEXT AS PART OF THEM BUT I MEAN THIS IS JUST THE WORDS THE WORDS HERE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART AND THEY'RE SOMETHING SPECIAL TO KEEP IN MIND
GZp_u9KvnbA_3 0 NOW IF YOU WANT TO COLLAGE THESE ON THAT'S JUST FINE THEY'LL LOOK JUST LIKE THIS BUT YOU KNOW WITH THIS TYPE OF CONTRAST WE MAY WANT TO PHOTO TRANSFER THESE GUYS ON
GZp_u9KvnbA_4 0 SO YOU KNOW IF THAT WERE THE CASE YOU KNOW YOU'D CUT THIS GUY OUT AND YOU'D AGAIN USING YOUR MEDIA AND STICK IT DOWN MAYBE ABOVE HERE'S THE PROBLEM
GZp_u9KvnbA_5 0 WHEN YOU TRANSFER THIS DOWN IT'LL BECOME THE MIRROR IMAGE
GZp_u9KvnbA_6 0 YOU WON'T BE BUT IT'LL BASICALLY BE NONSENSE READING SO IF YOU WANTED TO ADD A HEADLINE YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE EXTRA STEP OF GETTING A MIRROR IMAGE OF IT SO THAT BASICALLY THIS IS GOING TO READ YOU KNOW NOPUOC ZIB TRA RORROH IF YOU WERE TO BASICALLY PUT IT BACKWARDS SO THAT WHENEVER YOU BASICALLY THEN DO PASTE IT DOWN THEN IT WILL READ THE CORRECT IT'LL BE THE MIRROR IMAGE AND THEN WILL READ HORROR ART.BIZ COUPON SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE NOT TO FORGET THAT IT IS VERY EASY
GZp_u9KvnbA_7 0 BECAUSE IN A PICTURE YOU'LL NOTICE THIS IS THE MIRROR IMAGE BUT YOU KNOW WELL SO WHAT YOU KNOW HIS THIS SIDE OF HIS FACE IS NOW OVER HERE NOT A BIG DEAL
GZp_u9KvnbA_8 0 IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE ABLE TO USE TEXT AND WORDING THAT BECOMES A VERY BIG DEAL SO MAKE SURE AND WATCH OUT FOR THAT IN CASE YOU WANT TO TRANSFER ANY WORDS ONTO YOUR PIECE OF WOOD
gOzREqyWAnA_1 0 HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
gOzREqyWAnA_2 0 WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW IS THE PROPER EXECUTION OF THE PITCH AND THE SWEEP PLAY USING THE RUNNING BACKS
gOzREqyWAnA_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SWEEP FIRST
gOzREqyWAnA_4 0 WHEN OUR QUARTERBACK TAKES THE SNAP HE'S GOING TO TURN AND FAKE TO THE FULLBACK
gOzREqyWAnA_5 0 THAT WILL ALLOW THE DEFENSE TO CREEP UP AND ADJUST AND THEN THE FULLBACK WILL GO THROUGH AND HELP BLOCK
gOzREqyWAnA_6 0 THEN THE QUARTERBACK WILL STEP OUT
gOzREqyWAnA_7 0 THIS IS A LONG HAND OFF
gOzREqyWAnA_8 0 THIS IS NOT A SHORT HAND OFF
gOzREqyWAnA_9 0 WE WANT TO HAND OFF BECAUSE HE'S HEADING TO THE OUTSIDE NOT OFF TACKLE NOT TO THE SIX HOLE BUT HE'S GOING TO THE EIGHT HOLE OUTSIDE AND TRY TO TURN IT UP FIELD AFTER HE TAKES THE HAND OFF
gOzREqyWAnA_10 0 THAT'S THE JOB OF THE RUNNING BACK AND THE QUARTERBACK EXCHANGE WHILE DOING THE SWEEP PLAY
gOzREqyWAnA_11 0 THE SWEEP IS THE HAND OFF PORTION OF THE PLAY
gOzREqyWAnA_12 0 THE PITCH WE'LL GET TO A LITTLE LATER
gOzREqyWAnA_13 0 THE SWEEP PLAY WE WANT TO HAND IT OFF AND GET OUR GUY TO THE OUTSIDE AS QUICKLY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN
g4Fw3WNZGwk_1 0 I'D LIKE TO TALK NOW ABOUT GPS
g4Fw3WNZGwk_2 0 THESE SYSTEMS ARE NOT FOOL PROOF
g4Fw3WNZGwk_3 0 YOU DO NEED TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING
g4Fw3WNZGwk_4 0 BUT THE NICE THING ABOUT THEM IS THEY DO A LITTLE BIT OF THE MATH FOR YOU
g4Fw3WNZGwk_5 0 THE MATH AND COMPASS STUFF YOU KIND OF HAVE TO FIGURE THINGS OUT
g4Fw3WNZGwk_6 0 BUT ON HERE BECAUSE IT'S USING SATELLITES TO FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU ARE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THE TROUBLE OF MAKING SURE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE ON THE MAP
g4Fw3WNZGwk_7 0 SOME UNITS WILL HAVE A MAP IN IT LIKE THIS ONE
g4Fw3WNZGwk_8 0 THIS ONE'S LOADED UP WITH A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP WHICH IS HANDY FOR HIKING
g4Fw3WNZGwk_9 0 IT HAS INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO ELEVATION TRAILS EVEN TOWNS AND ROADS
g4Fw3WNZGwk_10 0 AGAIN NICE THING IT'S GOING TO TELL YOU WHERE YOU ARE
g4Fw3WNZGwk_11 0 IT HAS OTHER FEATURES HERE
g4Fw3WNZGwk_12 0 YOU HAVE A BUTTON HERE THAT SAYS MARK
g4Fw3WNZGwk_13 0 THAT ALLOWS YOU TO MARK A WAY POINT INTO THE UNIT
g4Fw3WNZGwk_14 0 THAT MIGHT BE YOUR CAMPSITE
g4Fw3WNZGwk_15 0 YOU MARK IT AND IF YOU HAVE TO WALK AWAY AND COME BACK IT ALLOWS YOU TO DO THAT BY CLICKING THE FIND BUTTON AND RECALLING THAT WAY POINT
g4Fw3WNZGwk_16 0 MAPS ARE OFTEN NOT PRELOADED ONTO THE UNITS AND SO THERE'S SOFTWARE PACKAGES AND THIS MODEL EVEN ACCEPTS MICRO SD CARDS THAT ARE PRELOADED WITH MAPS
g4Fw3WNZGwk_17 0 THEY COME IN DIFFERENT SIZES
g4Fw3WNZGwk_18 0 THIS ONE OF COURSE BEING A LITTLE BIT LIGHTER AND A LITTLE BIT MORE PREFERABLE TO A BACKPACKER
g4Fw3WNZGwk_19 0 IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS GIVE YOUR LOCAL OUTFITTER A HOLLER
HAbWP5g7REE_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM MY NAME IS ALLISON AT WESTERN ART GLASS

ggbxWDFleYc_9 0 YOU CANNOT DRIBBLE WITH TWO HANDS
ggbxWDFleYc_10 0 THAT'S GOING TO BE CALLED FOR A DOUBLE DRIBBLE
ggbxWDFleYc_11 0 SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DRIBBLE LIKE THIS

hEsXvKt-_aA_1 0 THIS IS JOHN WITH EXPERT VILLAGE TELLING YOU ABOUT LOGOS
hEsXvKt-_aA_2 0 I BASICALLY FLATTEN THE TEXTURE TO THE FONT TO MAKE A FLAT IMAGE
hEsXvKt-_aA_3 0 SO THEREFORE I COULDN'T REALLY CHANGE THE LETTERS ANYMORE AND THEN I CREATED A DROP SHADOW RIGHT HERE YOU SEE SO THAT WAY I CAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE DEPTH
hEsXvKt-_aA_4 0 JUST VERY SIMPLE IT WASN'T A WHOLE LOT I DIDN'T EVEN MAKE ANY DEPTH ON THE ACTUAL ROCK
hEsXvKt-_aA_5 0 THE ROCK IS FLAT I JUST ADDED A DROP SHADOW AND THEN ON THE STONE CARVINGS HERE I CREATED ANOTHER TWIST
hEsXvKt-_aA_6 0 SO I PUT I BELIEVE ON THIS ONE IT WAS JUST SPHERE OF DISTORTION AND I JUST SPHERIZED IT BECAUSE NOW IT'S JUST A PHOTOGRAPH INSIDE OF TEXT AND I JUST DID A SPHERE AND I JUST CREATED A SLIGHT CURVATURE AND THIS GIVES IT A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE TEXTURE
hEsXvKt-_aA_7 0 NOW ON THE BOTTOM HERE I CHOSE A DIFFERENT COLOR THE COLOR ACTUALLY KIND OF MATCHES WITH THE LEAVES IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SO IT DOESN'T BLEND TOO MUCH SO THAT WAY IT WAS AT LEAST SIMILAR AND THEN WE TOOK RED A CONTRASTING RED FOR THE BOTTOM AND COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
hEsXvKt-_aA_8 0 NOW IF YOU ACTUALLY NOTICE USUALLY YOU WANT TO STICK WITH SOME SORT OF CONSISTENCY ON YOUR FONTS BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR LOGO THEY WANTED SOMETHING THAT WAS THE FOCUS WAS ON THE MAIN ONE HERE
hEsXvKt-_aA_9 0 SO THESE FONTS WEREN'T AS IMPORTANT IN FACT THEY WANTED THIS ONE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

GF3Spd4wC4Q_7 0 YOU'LL BE ON THE MICROPHONE SINGING A SCRATCH VOCAL WHICH JUST GIVES THEM A POINT OF REFERENCE TO WHERE THE MELODY FALLS RHYTHMICALLY AND ALSO WHAT PART OF THE SONG THAT THEY'RE IN
GF3Spd4wC4Q_8 0 AND WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING YOUR VOCAL RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER
GF3Spd4wC4Q_9 0 BUT THAT JUST GIVES THEM A REFERENCE TO LISTEN TO TO KNOW WHERE TO PLAY
GF3Spd4wC4Q_10 0 SO GENERALLY TWO OR THREE TAKES THEY'LL GET SOMETHING THAT FEELS GREAT
GF3Spd4wC4Q_11 0 THE MUSICIANS WILL TAKE A FEW EXTRA MINUTES TO MAKE FIXES TO LITTLE PLACES THAT THEY'VE BLOWN AND WE'LL GET JUST THE RIGHT PERFORMANCE ON EACH SONG
GF3Spd4wC4Q_12 0 GENERALLY THAT TAKES ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY-FIVE MINUTES TO AN HOUR PER SONG TO GET IT JUST LIKE WE LIKE IT BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SONG AND THAT'LL WRAP UP YOUR TRACKING SESSION
G9TsRa-TaX4_1 0 HI THIS IS LINDSAY COLBUS FROM LINDSAY COLBUS ACCESSORIES AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO CHOOSE A HANDBAG

G9TsRa-TaX4_4 0 IT HAS THIS GIANT PADLOCK WHICH IS VERY COOL BUT IN THIS CASE IT DOESN'T COMPLEMENT THE OUTFIT NICELY
G9TsRa-TaX4_5 0 IT DOES HAVE SLIVER SO YOU MIGHT BE THINKING OH IT HAS SILVER HARDWARE MATCHES THE HARDWARE IN THE SHOES THAT MAY BE TRUE BUT THE OVERALL BULKINESS OF THE BAG THE SIZE OF THE BAG THE FACT THAT IT IS BLUE AND I'M WEARING BLACK AND PINK IT JUST IT OFF SETS THE OUTFIT IN A BAD WAY
G9TsRa-TaX4_6 0 YOU WANT THE FOCUS TO BE ON YOU YOUR SHOES YOUR JEWELERY YOUR ACCESSORIES YOUR BAG THEY ARE ALL THERE TO COMPLEMENT WHAT YOU ARE WEARING

-H4uPLWWfBo_14 0 THE HAIR LINE COMES RIGHT DOWN TO ALMOST ACROSS

gDviMlsLdxE_6 0 SO WHAT'S GOING TO BE HAPPENING HERE WE'RE STILL DOING JUST IN REGARDS TO WHAT I JUST SAY ON THAT LAST CLIP WE'RE GOING TO BE CONTINUING WITH THE EIGHTH NOTE DURATION OF THE LIFT
gDviMlsLdxE_7 0 SO YOUR LEFT FOOT IS GOING TO BE COMING DOWN ON THE UPBEAT OKAY
gDviMlsLdxE_8 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO DO OPEN ON THE DOWNBEAT OF ONE AND TWO WHICH MEANS WE'RE GOING TO BE CLOSING THE HIGH HAT ON THE UPBEAT OF ONE AND THE UPBEAT OF TWO
gDviMlsLdxE_10 0 SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IN RELATIONSHIP TO WHAT OUR OTHER DRUMS ARE DOING
gDviMlsLdxE_11 0 THE KICK DRUM AND THE HIGH HAT WITH THE FOOT ARE GOING TO SOUND LIKE THIS
gDviMlsLdxE_13 0 I SAID THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO SOUND LIKE IT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO SOUND LIKE CAUSE YOU HAVE THAT OPEN THING BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING
gDviMlsLdxE_14 0 OKAY THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE PHYSICALLY DOING

hiY_wZXp7tI_1 0 WE ALL LOVE OUR BEAUTIFUL GREEN LAWNS
hiY_wZXp7tI_2 0 AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE FIND THERE'S WEEDS POPPING UP EVERYWHERE AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
hiY_wZXp7tI_3 0 WE RUN DOWN TO THE STORE AND GET ALL TYPES OF CHEMICALS THAT WILL KILL THE BROAD LEAVES
hiY_wZXp7tI_4 0 BUT WHAT WE DON'T REALIZE IS ALL THOSE CHEMICALS ARE KILLING EVERYTHING ELSE TOO
hiY_wZXp7tI_5 0 AND THEY'RE REALLY BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
hiY_wZXp7tI_6 0 THEY GET INTO THE WATERWAYS AND THEY'RE DOING LOTS OF DAMAGE TO THE FISH
hiY_wZXp7tI_7 0 SO WHAT ARE SOME ALTERNATIVES TO GETTING RID OF THE WEEDS IN OUR GARDEN
hiY_wZXp7tI_8 0 FIRST OF ALL THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR LAWN IS TO GIVE IT MORE GRASS SEED IN THE SPRING AND THE FALL
hiY_wZXp7tI_9 0 SO THE EASIEST WAY TO GET RID OF WEEDS IN YOUR LAWN ARE TO STOP THEM FROM SHOWING UP AT ALL IS TO JUST TAKE THE LITTLE AREAS IN YOUR YARD WHERE THERE ARE SOME WEEDS OR BLANK SPOTS AND EVERY SPRING IN THE LATE SPRING ABOUT APRIL WHEN THE NIGHTS ARE GETTING A LITTLE WARMER JUST ADD A BUNCH OF COMPOST OR POTTING SOIL ON TOP OF YOUR WEEDS AND JUST GRASS SEED IT
hiY_wZXp7tI_10 0 JUST PUT LOTS OF GRASS SEED GRASS SEED THAT WILL COME BACK EVERY YEAR ON TOP OF THE DIRT
hiY_wZXp7tI_11 0 AND YOU'LL FIND THE GRASS WILL JUST FILL IN ABOVE THE WEEDS AND THE WEEDS WILL NOT BE THERE
hiY_wZXp7tI_12 0 I'VE DONE THIS EVERY SPRING AND EVERY FALL AND I FOUND THAT MOST OF THE WEEDS IN MY LAWN ARE GONE WITH LITTLE TO NO TROUBLE AT ALL
H6jkFOINe-0_1 0 I'M A UNION VOICE OVER ACTOR
H6jkFOINe-0_2 0 I'VE NEVER BEEN A NON-UNION VOICE OVER ACTOR
H6jkFOINe-0_3 0 I WAS ALREADY IN SAG AND AFTRA WHEN I STARTED DOING VOICE OVERS SO I'VE NEVER DONE NON-UNION WORK
H6jkFOINe-0_4 0 THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DO NON-UNION WORK AND YOU'RE EITHER UNION OR YOU'RE NOT UNION SO I CAN'T SPEAK TOO MUCH TO NON-UNION OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT UNION WORK
H6jkFOINe-0_5 0 WITH UNION WORK WHAT YOU DO IS YOU GET HEALTH AND PENSION BENEFITS AND YOU GET GUARANTEED AMOUNTS FOR THE RUN OF A SHOW OR YOU GET RESIDUALS OR YOU GET A BUY OUT BUT THOSE RATES ARE SET AND THEY'RE STANDARD AND THE REASON WHY WE HAVE THAT IS TO SAFEGUARD US AGAINST NOT BEING EXPLOITED I GUESS
H6jkFOINe-0_6 0 THE OTHER THING ABOUT DOING UNION WORK IS THAT UNION WORK CAN BE RECOGNIZED AS PART OF YOUR OVERALL WORK TO GET BENEFITS LIKE RETIRING BENEFIT RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
H6jkFOINe-0_7 0 I'VE BEEN IN THE UNION FOR A LONG TIME SO I'VE BEEN A UNION MEMBER FOR A LONG TIME SO I ONLY DO UNION WORK
hJ422fFGjuQ_1 0 HI MY NAME IS JERIMAE YODER ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE HEY GUYS AFTER YOU DONE SOME BOOKING AND YOU AGREED VERBALLY WITH THE VENUE THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE YOU IN ON SPECIFIC DATE YOUR GOING TO WANT TO SEND THEM AN APPEARANCE AGREEMENT AND A TOUR RIDER
hJ422fFGjuQ_2 0 THE APPEARANCE AGREEMENT MERELY STATES THAT YES WE'RE GOING TO SHOW UP AT YOUR VENUE AS SUCH AND SUCH TIME AT SUCH AND SUCH DATE AND WE'RE GOING TO PLAY FOR SO LONG FOR X AMOUNT OF MONEY
hJ422fFGjuQ_3 0 THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT THAT OUTLINES AND ALSO IF THEY DECIDE TO CANCEL WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OR WITHIN A MONTH WHATEVER THE TERMS TO THAT TO THOSE STIPULATIONS IF YOU SHOW UP AT A SHOW AND THEY DECIDED TO CANCEL THE SHOW BUT THEY DIDN'T LET YOU KNOW THEY STILL OWE YOU MONEY WITH THE CONTRACT THAT THEY SIGNED
hJ422fFGjuQ_4 0 THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET THE MONEY THAT YOU DESERVE EVEN IF THEY DO SOMETHING THATS A LITTLE SQUIRRELLY
hJ422fFGjuQ_5 0 A TOUR RIDER BASICALLY SAYING THAT HEY THIS IS KIND OF WHAT WE LIKE TO HAVE WHEN WE GET THERE WE WANT TO HAVE A MEAL YOU WANT TO HAVE A PLACE TO STAY THINGS LIKE THAT
hJ422fFGjuQ_6 0 BEFORE YOU GET ON THE ROAD SO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR APPEARANCE AGREEMENT TOUR RIDER BEFORE YOU GO TO THOSE EITHER TO YOUR PROMOTER OR TOUR MANAGER
h_6BBJuiz6k_1 0 HI I'M JIM FROM ZOAR OUTDOOR ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
h_6BBJuiz6k_2 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT FISHING GEAR AND ESPECIALLY FLY FISHING
h_6BBJuiz6k_3 0 A SECOND MAJOR COMPONENT OF FLY FISHING IS THE FLY REEL
h_6BBJuiz6k_4 0 AS YOU CAN SEE HERE WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT SIZES OF FLY REEL RANGING FROM SMALL LITTLE TINY TROUT ROT REELS ALL THE WAY UP TO LARGE SALTWATER FLY REELS
h_6BBJuiz6k_5 0 YOU'LL NOTE THAT ON EACH OF THESE REELS SOMEWHERE I MADE A NOTATION OF WHAT THE BACKING IS 300 YARDS OF FORTY POUNDS TESTâTHAT'S THREE FOOTBALL FIELDSâAND A TRIANGLE TAPER EIGHT WEIGHT INTERMEDIATE
h_6BBJuiz6k_6 0 THIS IS A SALTWATER REEL FOR STRIPE BASS FALSE ALBACORE AND IT'S NOT THE SORT OF THING THAT THE BEGINNING ANGLER WOULD BE USING BUT THIS IS THE RANGE OF HOW HIGH IT WOULD GO
h_6BBJuiz6k_7 0 ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM IS A TINY LITTLE REEL WHICH ISN'T MARKED BUT THIS IS AN OLD ORVIS CFO REEL AND THIS HAS GOT A ONE WEIGHT LINE ON IT AND ABOUT THIRTY YARDS OF BACKING
h_6BBJuiz6k_8 0 SO ON A RANGE FROM ONE WEIGHT TO TEN WEIGHT OVER HERE YOU HAVE QUIET A RANGE OF CHOICES
h_6BBJuiz6k_9 0 WHAT I RECOMMEND IS A SINGLE ACTION REEL IN THE CASE OF EACH OF THESE REELS IT'S A SINGLE ACTION WHICH MEANS THAT FOR EVERY REVOLUTION OF THE SPOOL YOU BRING IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF LINE SO THAT ONE TURN LIKE THIS WILL BRING IN ABOUT NINE INCHES OF FLY LINE
GBTnE4HwuxE_1 0 NOW THAT THE FACE AND EYES ARE DONE THE LAST THING WE HAVE TO DO IS LIPS
GBTnE4HwuxE_2 0 THIS IS ALREADY A REALLY CUTE FLIRTY CALIFORNIA LOOK
GBTnE4HwuxE_3 0 WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO A SHEER GLOSSY PINK LIP COLOR ON THE LIPS
GBTnE4HwuxE_4 0 IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY SHEER AND NATURAL
GBTnE4HwuxE_5 0 CAMERON DIAZ NORMALLY HAS A VERY NEUTRAL SHADE ON HER LIPS
GBTnE4HwuxE_6 0 ONCE IN A WHILE YOU'LL SEE HER IN A RED BUT BECAUSE SHE HAS BIG LIPS NORMALLY SHE JUST PLAYS UP THE EYES AND DOES A REALLY NEUTRAL KIND OF GLOSSY PINK OR NUDE LIP
GBTnE4HwuxE_7 0 THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
GBTnE4HwuxE_8 0 LIZZIE HAS NICE BIG LIPS SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO A NICE PINK GLOSS
GBTnE4HwuxE_9 0 YOU CAN MIX YOUR GLOSSES TOGETHER TO CREATE THE COLOR GLOSS THAT YOU WANT
GBTnE4HwuxE_10 0 I JUST HAPPEN TO FIND A REALLY COOL CUTE PINK
GBTnE4HwuxE_11 0 OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE MADE MY OWN GLOSS BY MIXING A CLEAR WITH A PINK OR A LIGHT PINK AND DARK PINK
GBTnE4HwuxE_12 0 YOU REALLY JUST CAN'T MESS THIS UP
GBTnE4HwuxE_13 0 JUST MAKE SURE THE COLOR IS NEUTRAL ENOUGH THAT IT DOESN'T OVER POWER THE EYES BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE EYES
GBTnE4HwuxE_14 0 JUST MAKE SURE IT'S ON THE LIPS EVENLY
GBTnE4HwuxE_15 0 YOU CAN USE A LIP LINER IF YOU WANT
GBTnE4HwuxE_16 0 JUST MAKE SURE IT'S REALLY NEUTRAL AND A SIMILAR SHADE
GBTnE4HwuxE_17 0 IF YOU DON'T HAVE BIG LIPS AND YOU WANT TO DRAW ON SOME LIPS WITH A NEUTRAL LIP LINER DO THAT AND THEN PUT THE LIP GLOSS RIGHT ON TOP OF IT
GBTnE4HwuxE_18 0 THERE WE GO
GBTnE4HwuxE_19 0 THERE'S OUR PINK GLOSS
HcPG7m_ZxVU_1 0 HI BILL LYONS HERE FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR QUICK THAI CURRY
HcPG7m_ZxVU_2 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FLAVOR OF QUICK THAI CURRY
HcPG7m_ZxVU_3 0 AND FLAVORING IS WHAT CURRY IS ALL ABOUT
HcPG7m_ZxVU_4 0 THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF CURRIES
HcPG7m_ZxVU_5 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT JUST A FEW THAT I HAVE ON HAND HERE
HcPG7m_ZxVU_6 0 WE HAVE A GREEN CURRY A RED CURRY
HcPG7m_ZxVU_7 0 THIS IS A PENANG CURRY WHICH YOU WOULD USE WITH LIKE A NOODLE TYPE PRODUCT
HcPG7m_ZxVU_8 0 THIS IS ANOTHER TYPE OF RED CURRY
HcPG7m_ZxVU_9 0 THERE'S ALSO YELLOW CURRIES
HcPG7m_ZxVU_10 0 THERE ARE HOT CURRIES MILD CURRIES
HcPG7m_ZxVU_11 0 YOU COULD ALSO INSTEAD OF USING THESE INGREDIENTS IF YOU CHOOSE YOU COULD USE CUMIN CORIANDER RED PEPPER AND A LITTLE BIT OF CAYENNE TO MAKE YOUR OWN CURRY
HcPG7m_ZxVU_12 0 CURRY IS KIND OF A FAMILY OF FLAVORS
HcPG7m_ZxVU_13 0 IT'S A MIX OF SPICES THAT ARE USED IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD TO SEASON NOT ONLY MEATS BUT ALSO VEGETABLES AND TOFU
HcPG7m_ZxVU_14 0 CURRY IS CAN RANGE FROM VERY MILD TO A VERY SUBTLE FLAVOR ALL THE WAY UP TO THE KIND THAT YOU JUST WANT TO GRAB A GLASS OF ICE WATER THEN IT'S FIERY HOT
HcPG7m_ZxVU_15 0 AND IT'S A MATTER OF PERSONAL PREFERENCE
HcPG7m_ZxVU_16 0 MOST OF US ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE MORE SUBTLE CURRIES THE SOFTER CURRIES THAT DON'T HAVE A LOT OF PEPPER PRODUCTS IN THEM
HcPG7m_ZxVU_17 0 ANY OF THESE CURRIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE HERE OUT OF YOUR ORIENTAL MARKETS OR YOUR GENERAL GROCERY STORES TEND TO BE THE MEDIUM TO THE MILDER CURRIES
HcPG7m_ZxVU_18 0 THE ORIENTAL MARKETS AND THE SPECIALTY STORES TEND TO HAVE THE HOTTER CURRIES OR YOU CAN TAKE ANY ONE OF THESE AND IF YOU WANT TO KICK IT UP WITH A LITTLE BIT OF HOT SAUCE OR A SHIRAISHI SAUCE WHICH IS A CHINESE OR A KOREAN TYPE HOT SAUCE
HcPG7m_ZxVU_20 0 BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THAT
HcPG7m_ZxVU_21 0 BUT TODAY WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS MORE ON THE SOFTER MORE GENTLE SAUCES ALONG WITH OUR COCONUT BASE
HcPG7m_ZxVU_22 0 IN A MINUTE WE'LL BE BACK AND WE'LL START TALKING ABOUT THE VEGETABLES THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE USING IN OUR CURRY TODAY
GHYrASBqbOg_1 0 AMANDA CLAIRE ONE THING YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO WHEN YOU MAKE A CIRCUIT BENDING PROJECT IS BE ABLE TO PLUG IT TO AMPLIFIER
GHYrASBqbOg_2 0 SO I'VE GOT A 1/4-INCH GUITAR CABLE PLUG INTO THIS ONE BECAUSE I INSTALLED A JACK INTO IT AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT JACKS NEXT
GHYrASBqbOg_3 0 BUT I CAN MAKE THIS AS LOUD AS I WANT NOW
GHYrASBqbOg_4 0 I DON'T HAVE IT TOO LOUD RIGHT NOW BUT YOU CAN GET A LOT MORE AMPLIFICATION IF YOU JUST RUN IT THROUGH A SIMPLE AUDIO JACK AND OUT THROUGH YOUR GUITAR AMPLIFIER OR YOUR STEREO OR YOUR RECORDING STUDIO YOUR MIXING BOARD OR WHATEVER IT IS
GHYrASBqbOg_5 0 SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT JACKS A LITTLE BIT
GHYrASBqbOg_6 0 THERE'S HERE JUST A FEW DIFFERENT KINDS OF JACKS HERE
GHYrASBqbOg_7 0 BASICALLY YOU'VE GOT 1/4-INCH JACKS LIKE THESE ARE 1/4-INCH JACKS THAT'S A DIAMETER OF THE PLUG THAT GOES INTO THEM
GHYrASBqbOg_8 0 AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THE 1/8-INCH JACKS WHICH IS LIKE KIND OF A MINI JACK LIKE A MINIATURE HEADPHONE JACKS THAT'S WHAT THESE ARE
GHYrASBqbOg_9 0 AND THEN THERE IS ANOTHER SIZE JUST IS LIKE A BANANA PLUG JACK WHICH IS KIND OF A LITTLE BIT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT SMALLER I MIGHT BE WRONG ON THAT BUT THE MAIN SIZES ARE GOING TO BE EITHER 1/4-INCH OR 1/8-INCH SIZE JACKS
GHYrASBqbOg_10 0 AND EVEN AMONG THOSE JACKS THERE ARE DIFFERENCES LIKE IF YOU LOOK HERE THIS IS A MONO JACK
GHYrASBqbOg_11 0 SO THIS IS LIKE WHAT'S USED IN YOUR GUITAR RIGHT
GHYrASBqbOg_12 0 IT HAS BASICALLY ONE CONTACT THAT IT MAKES WITH THAT PLUG
GHYrASBqbOg_13 0 ACTUALLY I'LL SHOW YOU RIGHT HERE
GHYrASBqbOg_14 0 THIS HOW IT KIND OF GOES IN
GHYrASBqbOg_15 0 IF WE KIND OF PLUG IT IN THERE YOU CAN SEE THAT CONTACT GOES IN RIGHT THERE
GHYrASBqbOg_16 0 SO THAT'S A MONO JACK
GHYrASBqbOg_17 0 BUT IF YOU THINGS LIKE STEREO HEADPHONES YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE A STEREO JACK AND THIS HAS GOT TWO CONTACTS ON IT AND THIS ISN'T THE STEREO PLUG
GHYrASBqbOg_18 0 IT ONLY HAS THE ONE KIND OF CONTACT
GHYrASBqbOg_19 0 BUT IT WERE STEREO PLUG IT WOULD HAVE ONE CONTACT HERE AND ONE CONTACT SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THEN SO YOU CAN KIND OF GET THOSE TWO SIGNALS TO THAT ONE PLUG BUT THIS IS ONLY A MONO PLUG
GHYrASBqbOg_20 0 SO MONO JACKS STEREO JACKS IT KIND OF DOESN'T MATTER WHICH ONE YOU USE FOR CIRCUIT BENDING FOR THE MOST PART YOU'RE GOING TO BE MAKING MONO INSTRUMENTS IN YOUR CIRCUIT BEND
GHYrASBqbOg_21 0 I MEAN I GUESS YOU COULD RIG IT UP TO BE STEREO AND THEN MINI JACKS ARE BASICALLY THE SAME THING THEY'RE JUST SMALLER
GHYrASBqbOg_22 0 AND THEN LATER ON THE SERIES WE'LL SHOW HOW TO INSTALL A JACK SO THAT YOU CAN SEND AN AUDIO SIGNAL OUT OF YOUR PROJECT AND INTO AN AMPLIFIER OR OTHER KIND SOUND BOARD
gbvJRSW0RPc_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT OF HOW TO CURE YOUR SLICE AND HIT A HOOK WE'RE GOING TO CONCERN OURSELVES WITH THE CLUB HEAD
gbvJRSW0RPc_2 0 BECAUSE IT'S THE CLUB HEAD THAT HITS THE BALL AND THE BALL KNOWS ALL AND THE ONLY THING THE BALL KNOWS IS IMPACT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THERE BUT IF YOU COULD WATCH THE CLUB HEAD AT HOME IN PRACTICE SWINGS IN YOUR BACKYARD
gbvJRSW0RPc_3 0 I'M WATCHING THE CLUB HEAD AND I KNOW WHAT I WANT THAT CLUB HEAD TO DO
gbvJRSW0RPc_4 0 BECAUSE IF THERE WAS A GLOBE DOWN HERE ON THE GROUND AND I WANTED TO SPIN THAT GLOBE IF I TOOK THAT CLUB HEAD AND I'M JUST WATCHING THE CLUB HEAD IF I BROUGHT THAT CLUB HEAD INSIDE AND SWUNG THAT CLUB HEAD OUT AND BEFORE I GOT TO THAT GLOBE I RELEASED OR TURNED IT OVER OR FLIPPED IT OVER
gbvJRSW0RPc_5 0 INSIDE OUT OVER
gbvJRSW0RPc_6 0 LOOK AT THAT GLOBE LOOK AT THAT
gbvJRSW0RPc_7 0 THAT IS GOING TO SPIN THAT GLOBE
gbvJRSW0RPc_8 0 SO AS A DRILL WATCH THE CLUB HEAD
gbvJRSW0RPc_9 0 YOU COULD EVEN DRAW A LINE ON THE GROUND
gbvJRSW0RPc_10 0 YOU COULD DRAW A LINE ON THE GROUND THAT ISN'T STRAIGHT BUT OUT TO THE RIGHT
gbvJRSW0RPc_11 0 YOU COULD EVEN PUT A SHAFT THERE
gbvJRSW0RPc_12 0 PUT ONE STRAIGHT AND PUT ONE OUT TO THE RIGHT AND SWING OUT TO THE RIGHT INSIDE OUT AND TURN IT OVER
gbvJRSW0RPc_13 0 WATCH THAT CLUB HEAD
gbvJRSW0RPc_14 0 INSIDE OUT AND TURN IT OVER
gbvJRSW0RPc_15 0 DO IT SLOWLY
gbvJRSW0RPc_16 0 DO IT OFTEN AND YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN THE FUNDAMENTAL MOVES TO HIT A HOOK
GVU1bHfi6lE_1 0 SO LET US DEAL WITH THE BACKGROUND A LITTLE BIT MORE
GVU1bHfi6lE_2 0 WE HAVE GOT THAT SHADOW
GVU1bHfi6lE_3 0 I DO NOT LIKE THAT SHADOW
GVU1bHfi6lE_4 0 OR AT LEAST CERTAINLY NOT THAT STRONG
GVU1bHfi6lE_5 0 I COULD SOFTEN IT BY DIFFUSING THIS WITH A DIFFUSION PANEL
GVU1bHfi6lE_6 0 BUT THAT TAKES AWAY THE MAGIC TO A DEGREE
GVU1bHfi6lE_7 0 I AM GOING TO TRY AND GET RID OF THAT THAT SHADOW IN ANOTHER WAY
GVU1bHfi6lE_8 0 PART OF IT IS OUT OF MY FRAME IN THE CAMERA
GVU1bHfi6lE_9 0 BUT I THINK THAT I CAN GET RID OF IT BY ADDING SOME LIGHT BACK IN THERE
GVU1bHfi6lE_10 0 WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN WE TURN THIS LIGHT BACK ON IS IT IS GOING TO MAKE THAT SHADOW LESS NOTICEABLE
GVU1bHfi6lE_11 0 SO WE ARE GOING TO ADD ANOTHER LIGHT
GVU1bHfi6lE_12 0 LET US ADD ANOTHER LIGHT JUST TO DEAL WITH THE BACKGROUND
GVU1bHfi6lE_13 0 SO IT WOULD BE A BACKGROUND LIGHT
GVU1bHfi6lE_14 0 SO I HAVE GOT ANOTHER LAMP HERE
GVU1bHfi6lE_15 0 AND I AM GOING TO PUSH PULL IT OVER INTO THIS POSITION HERE WHERE THE SHADOW IS THE STRONGEST
GVU1bHfi6lE_16 0 AND LET US DIRECT IT AT THAT SHADOW AND BRING IT UP
GVU1bHfi6lE_17 0 NOTICE THAT THE SHADOW IS DISAPPEARING AS THIS LIGHT COMES ON AND IS DIRECTED AT THAT SHADOW LOCATION
GVU1bHfi6lE_18 0 IT IS A LITTLE HARD TO SEE WHETHER IT IS ENOUGH AND THAT WILL DEPEND UPON THE EXPOSURE I PUT IN THE CAMERA
GVU1bHfi6lE_19 0 BUT THAT HAS AS FAR AS THE CAMERA IS CONCERNED THAT MAIN DARK SHADOW IS NOW INVISIBLE
GB_EmtzO-Yc_1 0 I'M NANCY FRENSLEY I'M THE TRAINING MANAGER AT THE BERKELEY EAST BAY HUMAN SOCIETY IN BERKELEY CALIFORNIA
GB_EmtzO-Yc_2 0 AND APPARENTLY THE QUESTION OF THE DAY IS HOW TO RESCUE A MALTESE DOG
GB_EmtzO-Yc_3 0 WELL MALTESE ARE SMALL WHITE TOY DOGS
GB_EmtzO-Yc_4 0 THE BREED MALTESE JUST THEY'RE VERY CUTE THEY'RE VERY CUDDLY
GB_EmtzO-Yc_5 0 THEY HAVE A LOT OF GROOMING NEEDS
GB_EmtzO-Yc_6 0 THEY HAVE VERY VERY LONG WHITE HAIR AND THEY'RE THE DOGS YOU'LL SEE VERY OFTEN THAT YOU KNOW HAVE A BARRETTE UP THERE AT THE TOP OF THEIR HEAD TO KEEP THEIR HAIR OFF THEIR EYES
GB_EmtzO-Yc_7 0 AND THEY'RE VERY SWEET DOGS
GB_EmtzO-Yc_8 0 MOST OF THE TIME THEY'RE RESCUED BY BREED ORGANIZATIONS
GB_EmtzO-Yc_9 0 MALTESE BREED CLUBS WHO HAVE PUT TOGETHER A RESCUE EFFORT THEY GET THEM OUT OF HUMANE SOCIETY SHELTERS AND MUNICIPAL FACILITIES AND PUT THEM IN TO FOSTER HOMES
GB_EmtzO-Yc_10 0 SO RESCUING MALTESE IS ACTUALLY PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS ADOPTING ONE
GB_EmtzO-Yc_11 0 SO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO RESCUE A MALTESE LOOK THEM UP ON LINE
GB_EmtzO-Yc_12 0 LOOK UP MALTESE RESCUE ORGANIZATIONS APPLY TO ADOPT AND ADOPT ONE
GB_EmtzO-Yc_13 0 AND EVERY TIME YOU ADOPT A MALTESE FROM A BREED ORGANIZATION THAT LEAVES ROOM FOR THEM GO GET ANOTHER ONE OUT OF A POUND OR A SHELTER
GILL9ysqWPQ_1 0 ALRIGHT NOW WE'VE TAKEN SOME TITANIUM WHITE CERULEAN BLUE AND SOME OF OUR MEDIA
GILL9ysqWPQ_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO START MIXING THESE GUYS BECAUSE THE SKY'S GOING TO BE A VERY THIN LAYER BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE A VERY PALE LAYER
GILL9ysqWPQ_3 0 SO TAKE YOUR PALETTE KNIFE AND GRAB SOME BLUE PUT IT DOWN HERE
GILL9ysqWPQ_4 0 GRAB A REALLY NICE THICK CHUNK OF WHITE
GILL9ysqWPQ_5 0 WHAT YOU BASICALLY WANT TO DO IS KEEP MIXING IT UNTIL YOU GET A VERY PALE BLUE
GILL9ysqWPQ_6 0 IMAGINE A SEA OF WHITE WITH A DROP OF BLUE IN IT
GILL9ysqWPQ_7 0 THEN ONCE YOU GET THIS VERY PALE BLUE TAKE SOME OF OUR MEDIA AND MIX IT IN TO FURTHER THIN IT OUT AND MAKE IT VERY EASY TO SPREAD ON THE CANVAS
GILL9ysqWPQ_8 0 AND THIS PIGMENT HERE IS GOING TO BE THE BEGINNING OF OUR SKY
GILL9ysqWPQ_9 0 SO TAKE YOUR BIGGEST FLAT HEAD BRUSH AND APPLY A LOT OF THIS LIGHT BLUE TO IT
GILL9ysqWPQ_10 0 THEN IT'S UP ONTO THE CANVAS
GILL9ysqWPQ_11 0 APPLY IN A SIDE MOTION WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SQUIGGLE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PIGMENT IS MAKING GOOD CONTACT WITH THE CANVAS
GILL9ysqWPQ_12 0 NOW RELATED TO THE CHARCOAL SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL TREAT THE CANVAS OR EVEN SPRAY SEAL IT BETWEEN THE CHARCOAL LAYER
GILL9ysqWPQ_13 0 ACTUALLY I DON'T PREFER DOING THAT BECAUSE I LIKE SOME OF THE EXTRA GRAY PIGMENT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET IN HERE
GILL9ysqWPQ_14 0 SO I JUST USE THE CHARCOAL AS ANOTHER MEDIA AND JUST GO WITH IT
GILL9ysqWPQ_15 0 YOU'RE GOING TO SPREAD THIS BLUE LAYER ALL THROUGHOUT THE SKY AREA USING A SIDE TO SIDE MOTION AND MAKING SURE YOU GET PLENTY OF PIGMENT
GILL9ysqWPQ_16 0 WE WANT THAT LAYER TO BE FAINT BUT DEFINITELY PRESENT
GILL9ysqWPQ_17 0 THAT IS EXCEPT UP IN THIS REGION WHICH WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE EMPTY TO DO A LITTLE MORE OF A CLOUD EFFECT
GILL9ysqWPQ_18 0 BUT YOU'LL FILL IN THIS SIDE AND YOU'LL ALSO FILL IN THIS SIDE ENTIRELY WITH THE SKY BLUE ONCE YOU'RE DONE
GJnyiJZpwFc_1 0 IN THIS EXERCISE WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS IN ON THE HAMSTRING THE BACK PART OF THE THIGH BICEP OF THE LEG
GJnyiJZpwFc_2 0 AND YOUR PARTNER WANTS TO YOU WANT YOUR PARTNER TO FLEX THEIR FOOT AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUT YOUR HAND ON THE MEATY PART OF THE CALF MUSCLE AS THEY FLEX UP AND USE RIGHT THERE THAT POINT OF ATTACHMENT IN THE HAMSTRING AND RELEASE
GJnyiJZpwFc_3 0 NOW YOU CAN ALSO IF YOUR PARTNER HAS SHOES ON PUT YOUR HAND ON THE HEEL RESIST UP JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT PUSHING THE ANKLE JOINT OUT OF LINE AND RELEASE DOWN
GJnyiJZpwFc_4 0 SO EITHER ON THE MEATY PART OF THE CALF AND COMING UP AND APPLYING RESISTANCE SO THEY ARE ACTIVATING THAT BACK PART OF THEIR THIGH AND RELEASE OR HERE ON THE HEEL COMING UP
GJnyiJZpwFc_5 0 HAMSTRING CURL IN A PRONE POSITION WORKING EIGHT TO TEN REPS FOR BEGINNERS TEN TO TWELVE AND UP ONE TO THREE SETS
h6wWikNqgoM_1 0 HERE WE HAVE WHAT IS CALLED A BOTTLE NECK OPENING
h6wWikNqgoM_2 0 A BOTTLE NECK IS NOT WHEN THE LINE BUILDS UP
h6wWikNqgoM_3 0 THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
h6wWikNqgoM_4 0 A BOTTLE NECK OPENING THINK OF LIKE A TWENTY OUNCE COKE AND THE CAP OF IT HAS LITTLE RIDGES LITTLE LINES IN IT
h6wWikNqgoM_5 0 THAT'S KIND OF WHAT THIS IS LOOKING LIKE TO GIVE YOU AN EVERYDAY INTERPRETATION OF IT
h6wWikNqgoM_6 0 BUT IT IS SIMILAR TO LIKE A SHIRT WITH THE RIBBED KNIT COLOR EXCEPT THAT IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT NAME I GUESS THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY
h6wWikNqgoM_7 0 BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER
h6wWikNqgoM_8 0 IT'S GOING TO NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE OUT OF KNITS AND THE STAND OF IT IS ALMOST LIKE LIKE AROUND A MOCK NECK HEIGHT
h6wWikNqgoM_9 0 IT'S ALL GOING TO BE ONE WELL IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ONE PIECE THIS IS ONE PIECE AND THEN THIS IS ANOTHER PIECE AND THEY'RE ATTACHED HERE
h6wWikNqgoM_10 0 BUT IT'S GOING TO HUG AT THE NECK PRETTY TIGHTLY AND THEN APPARENTLY WELL NOT APPARENTLY IT'LL MOST LIKELY HAVE SOME SORT OF INDENTIONS AND IT'LL BE SOME INDICATION THAT IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF FABRIC
GyUoVVz0nEY_1 0 HERE I HAVE A PAIR OF FLARED LEG PANTS THESE ARE DESIGNED AS JEANS BUT THE POINT OF HAVING FLARE LEGGED PANTS IS THAT IS MAKES YOUR LEGS LOOK THINNER
GyUoVVz0nEY_2 0 THAT'S ONE TRICK TO MINIMIZE BIGGER LEGS IS TO HAVE THEM SKINNY ALONG THE LEG AND THEN FLARE OUT AT THE BOTTOM
GyUoVVz0nEY_3 0 IT'LL MAKE THE OVERALL LOOK ELONGATED AND OBVIOUSLY WITH THESE KIND OF DRAWINGS THAT'S NOT NECESSARY BUT WITH A DRAWING LIKE THIS AND WITH A FASHION MODEL IT JUST SERVES TO REINFORCE THAT WHOLE POINT EVEN MORE SO AND ALMOST LIKE A CHARACTER OF A PERSON
GyUoVVz0nEY_4 0 WHICH IS WHAT THEY REALLY ARE BUT IF YOU MAKE YOUR DRAWING EXTRA SKINNY AS A OPPOSED TO SKINNY DRAWING THEN IT JUST DRIVES HOME YOU'RE WHOLE IDEA TO WHOEVER YOUR VIEWER IS TO WHOEVER YOU'RE SELLING YOUR COLLECTION TO TO PEOPLE WHO BUYING YOUR COLLECTION
GyUoVVz0nEY_5 0 NORMALLY WOMAN WANT TO LOOK THINNER IF YOU SHOW THEM THIS THEY'RE GOING TO BE LIKE OH
GyUoVVz0nEY_6 0 THOSE JEANS I WANT THEM THEY MAKE MY LEGS LOOK LONG MAKE MY LEGS LOOK THIN
GyUoVVz0nEY_7 0 YOU'RE MIND GOES AH BUY IT AND THEN CHA-CHING MONEY FOR YOU THE DESIGNER

GcPO8Y74cdA_1 0 HI THIS IS BRUCE LESSELS FROM ZOAR OUTDOOR ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
GcPO8Y74cdA_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MAKING A CAMPFIRE AND TAKING DOWN A CAMPFIRE AND CAMPFIRE SAFETY
GcPO8Y74cdA_3 0 WE'LL TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF SOIL AND IDEALLY YOU'RE DIGGING DOWN BELOW THE ORGANIC SOIL DOWN TO THE NON-ORGANIC SOIL AND YOU CAN KIND OF THROW THAT ON THE FIRE AND SMOOTHER IT
GcPO8Y74cdA_4 0 THE PROBLEM WITH USING SOIL TO PUT OUT A FIRE IS IT CAN INSULATE THE FIRE AND THE FIRE CAN KEEP BURNING UNDERNEATH THE SOIL AND SO YOU HAVEN'T REALLY PUT IT OUT AND IT MAY COME BACK IF YOU JUST USE THE SOIL ALTHOUGH IT IS A QUICK METHOD OF EXTINGUISHING THE FLAME
GcPO8Y74cdA_5 0 SO EVEN WHILE I'M DOING THAT I'M GOING TO SPREAD THE COALS AROUND A LITTLE BIT TRYING TO REALLY KEEP SEARCHING FOR THE STUFF THAT'S STILL HOT STILL BURNING AND I SPREAD IT AROUND AS MUCH AS I CAN KEEPING IT WITHIN THE PIT THE WHOLE TIME
GcPO8Y74cdA_6 0 ONCE THAT HAS DONE ITS JOB I'M GOING TO TAKE SOME WATER AND REALLY KIND OF FINELY EXTINGUISH THE FIRE MAKE SURE IT'S REALLY OUT AND I'M GOING TO POUR THE WATER SLOWLY
GcPO8Y74cdA_7 0 KIND OF STEP BACK WHEN YOU DO THIS BECAUSE USUALLY CREATES SOME STEAM AND ONCE AGAIN I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR ANYTHING THAT'S STILL BURNING ANYTHING THAT'S STILL SMOKING OR STEAMING
GcPO8Y74cdA_8 0 I'M GOING TO MIX IT AROUND TRY TO MAKE SURE I GET ALL THOSE EMBERS DON'T LEAVE ANYTHING AT ALL TO START ANOTHER FIRE WITHOUT ME KNOWING ABOUT IT
h9OYqrhfW98_1 0 VINCENT JAMAL I'M VINCENT ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
h9OYqrhfW98_2 0 NOW WE'VE GONE OVER THE CRACK WHICH IS A GREAT BLOCK
h9OYqrhfW98_3 0 NOW WHAT HE'S GOT ON HIS HANDS NOW IS HE'S GOT POSSIBLY A RUN OR A PLAY THAT'S GOING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD OR COMING UP THE MIDDLE SO HE'S GOING TO IGNORE ME AS THE QUARTERBACK
h9OYqrhfW98_4 0 HE'S STILL GOING TO USE HIS TECHNIQUE GETTING OFF THE BALL AND EVERYTHING BUT HE'S GOING TO DRAW A LINE STRAIGHT TO THAT FREE SAFETY WHICH IS CALLED STALK BLOCKING
h9OYqrhfW98_5 0 HE'S GOING TO TIME IT JUST SO WHEN HE'S MAKING HIS REACTION HE'S GOING TO HINDER BLOCK DO WHATEVER HE'S GOT TO DO WITHIN THE LEGAL PARAMETERS OF THE GAME TO KEEP HIM FROM COMING DOWN AND MAKING A PLAY ANY CLOSER THAN HE POSSIBLY NEEDS TO
h9OYqrhfW98_6 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO WALK THROUGH THIS
h9OYqrhfW98_7 0 SO THE BALL SNAPS SET GO HE'S GOING TO USE A SWIM DO EVERYTHING THAT HE NORMALLY DOES IT'S GOING TO LOOK JUST LIKE A ROUTE
h9OYqrhfW98_8 0 I MAY BE SITTING HERE AND HE COMES DOWNFIELD AND GETS IN FRONT OF CHRIS
h9OYqrhfW98_9 0 NOW CHRIS IS GOING TO BE WATCHING THE PLAY
h9OYqrhfW98_10 0 HE'S NOT GOING TO SEE BRYAN COMING THIS IS WHY IT'S A STALK BLOCK
h9OYqrhfW98_11 0 YOU'RE STALKING YOUR PREY
h9OYqrhfW98_12 0 SO LET'S RUN THROUGH THAT ONCE AGAIN AND IT'S A VERY FAST ROUTE
h9OYqrhfW98_13 0 IT'S JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER ROUTE
h9OYqrhfW98_14 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO RUN IT IN A LITTLE BIT FASTER TIME
h9OYqrhfW98_15 0 CHRIS IS GOING TO BE WATCHING WHAT'S GOING ON
h9OYqrhfW98_16 0 HE'S NOT PAYING ATTENTION BECAUSE HE THINKS THAT I'VE GOT THIS GUY
h9OYqrhfW98_17 0 SO SET GO SWIM HE'S GONE AND THERE YOU'VE GOT YOUR STALK BLOCK
h9OYqrhfW98_18 0 AND WHAT THIS ALLOWS TO HAPPEN IS IN A LOT OF CASES WHEN IT'S A RUN BALL HE'S GOING TO BLOW THIS MAN OUT AND THE RUNNING BACK SHOULD HAVE THE SMARTS TO GO OFF OF HIS BUTT
h9OYqrhfW98_19 0 WHEN HE SEES HIS BUTT HE GOES THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION BECAUSE THAT'S THE FLOW OF THE BLOCK
GbDXWdTmpZw_1 0 HI MY NAME IS CHRIS LATHAM AND WE'RE HERE TO DAY AT EMI MUSIC PUBLISHING'S NASHVILLE RECORDING STUDIO ON MUSIC ROW WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
GbDXWdTmpZw_2 0 ONE OF THE REASONS YOU WANT TO COME TO NASHVILLE TO RECORD YOUR DEMO OR YOUR PROJECT IS WE'VE GOT GREAT MUSICIANS HERE WHO WORK TOGETHER ALL THE TIME
GbDXWdTmpZw_3 0 THEY CAN PLAY OFF OF EACH OTHER WITHOUT EVEN SPEAKING WHAT THE PLAYING IS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO USED TO WORKING WITH EACH OTHER
GbDXWdTmpZw_4 0 NOW GRANTED THERE'S SOME COSTS INVOLVED
GbDXWdTmpZw_5 0 GENERALLY ON A SONG DEMO OR AN ARTIST DEMO YOU CAN EXPECT TO SPEND ANYWHERE BETWEEN SIX HUNDRED FIFTY AND TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER SONG TO GET IT DONE BUT YOU'RE GOING TO WALK AWAY WITH A PROJECT THAT YOU'LL BE PROUD TO PLAY FOR ANYBODY ANYBODY AT ANY OF THE RECORD LABELS BE PROUD TO SELL IT IN YOUR HOMETOWN OR PUT IT ON YOUR MYSPACE PAGE
GbDXWdTmpZw_6 0 YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A PRODUCT THAT'S GREAT AND WORTHY OF BEING PLAYED FOR PEOPLE
hjvqiK4Fbc4_1 0 THE MAJOR THING I KEEP COMING BACK TO OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN I AM TALKING ABOUT DISTRIBUTING THE WEIGHT IS SORT OF THINK ON THE ATTACK POSITION WHICH IS JUST LIKE IN SKIING WHERE LIKE PARALLEL SHOULDERS SQUARE OFF TO THE HILL WHAT YOU ARE GOING FOR CHROMATICALLY
hjvqiK4Fbc4_2 0 THE BIG THING YOU ARE GOING FOR CHROMATICALLY IN WEIGH DISTRIBUTION WISE ON A MOUNTAIN BIKE IS HAVING WEIGHT EVENLY DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN YOUR TWO WHEELS AND DOING THAT IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS YOU TO CONTROL WHAT YOU ARE DOING
hjvqiK4Fbc4_3 0 SO IT IS HARD TO DEMONSTRATE JUST SITTING HERE WHAT I AM DOING JUST LIKE EVEN IN MY GENERAL POSITION
hjvqiK4Fbc4_4 0 NOW MY WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION IS ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT ON THE REAR WHEEL SITTING HERE FORTY PERCENT ON THE FRONT WHEEL
hjvqiK4Fbc4_5 0 THAT IS PRETTY GOOD
hjvqiK4Fbc4_6 0 I CAN DROP MY CHEST A LITTLE BIT MORE TO PUT MORE WEIGHT ON THAT FRONT WHEEL WHICH IS IMPORTANT ANY TIME YOU WANT TO SLOW DOWN BECAUSE MOST OF YOUR BRAKING IS COMING FROM YOUR FRONT BRAKE AND IT IS IMPORTANT ANY TIME YOU JUST NEED TO BE MORE STABLE
hjvqiK4Fbc4_7 0 AS I CLIP IN YOU KNOW YOU CAN EVEN JUST BALANCE IT
hjvqiK4Fbc4_8 0 SO WHEN I AM UP HERE LIKE THIS A GUST OF WIND TRIES TO BLOW ME OVER THAT IS GOING TO BLOW ME OVER A LOT BETTER IF I AM LOW SQUAT AND AGGRESSIVE
hjvqiK4Fbc4_9 0 SO REALLY GETTING LOW AND STAYING LOW AND TRYING TO FORCE YOUR BODY WEIGHT DOWN TO THE WHEELS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN MAKES A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE IN HOW STABLE YOU RIDE AND HOW SUCCESSFUL YOU ARE WHEN YOU ARE TRYING
hjvqiK4Fbc4_10 0 SO THE COROLLARY TO THIS SORT OF ATTACK POSITION IS MIND SET WHICH IS ABOUT COMMITTING TO THINGS THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO
hjvqiK4Fbc4_11 0 SO IF YOU ARE COMMITTED IN YOUR BODY LANGUAGE AND POSTURE IT HELPS YOU STAY COMMITTED MENTALLY TO WHAT YOU ARE DOING
gx7_l732h7s_1 0 THE NEXT TYPE OF BOARD WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT IS A FREESTYLE BOARD
gx7_l732h7s_2 0 A FREESTYLE BOARD IS OFTEN CONFUSED WITH A FREE RIDE BOARD BUT LET ME TELL YOU THAT THE TWO BOARDS COULDN'T DIFFER ANY MORE
gx7_l732h7s_3 0 THEY DO BOTH HAVE A NOSE AND TAIL TO THEM BUT WITH A FREESTYLE BOARD IT IS USUALLY A TWIN TIPPED BOARD MEANING THAT NO MATTER WHAT WAY YOU RIDE IT IT IS GOING TO RIDE THE SAME
gx7_l732h7s_4 0 A FREESTYLE BOARD IS A LOT MORE FLEXIBLE SO IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO PERFORM TRICKS ON IT AND YOU GENERALLY RIDE IT WITH A LOT WIDER STANCE THAN ON A FREE RIDE BOARD
gx7_l732h7s_5 0 TO WIDEN YOUR STANCE FIND THE PRE-MARKED FACTORY HOLES AND GO AS FAR AWAY FROM THEM AS YOU CAN TOWARDS EITHER END OF THE BOARD
gx7_l732h7s_6 0 ONCE YOU HAVE FOUND THESE HOLES TAKE YOUR BINDING PLATES LINE THEM UP CORRESPONDING TO THE ANGLES THAT YOU RIDE PLACE THEM OVER THE HOLES INSERT SCREWS INTO THE BINDINGS AND TIGHTEN THEM
gx7_l732h7s_7 0 ONCE TIGHTENED TAKE YOUR BOOT LOOSEN UP YOUR STRAPS AND YOU ARE GOOD TO GO
G47Mib5m0Aw_2 0 I'M KARL JAMES OWNER OF CREOLESOUL CATERING IN ROUND ROCK TEXAS ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M HERE TO SHOW YOU CRAW FISH ETOUFFEE
G47Mib5m0Aw_3 0 OKAY OUR SAUCE HAVE BEEN SIMMERING NOW FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT HAS THICKEN UP QUIET A BIT
G47Mib5m0Aw_4 0 IT IS NOT REAL THICK BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT IT IS MORE LIKE A SAUCE RATHER THEN RUNNY OR THICK AS A GRAVY
G47Mib5m0Aw_5 0 BUT AT THIS POINT WE ARE GOING TO ADD OUR SPECIAL INGREDIENT FIRST OF ALL WE ARE GOING TO ADD THAT CRAB MEAT THAT WE HAVE AND YOU CAN BY LUMP CRAB OR YOU CAN GET A COUPLE OF CANS OF CRAB MEAT AND THAT WOULD WORK BECAUSE WE JUST WANT THIS TO SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE ETOUFFEE
G47Mib5m0Aw_6 0 NOW WE HAVE THE CRABS IN WE ARE GOING TO ADD OUR SHRIMP FIRST BEFORE THE CRAW FISH BECAUSE THE SHRIMP IS GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER BECAUSE THE CRAW FISH ARE PRECOOKED ALREADY
G47Mib5m0Aw_7 0 SO WE ARE GOING TO ADD THE SHRIMP IN FIRST AND MIX THAT AROUND
G47Mib5m0Aw_8 0 OKAY NOW THAT WE HAVE OUR SHRIMP IN WE ARE GOING TO REACH OVER HERE AND GRAB OUR CRAW FISH
G47Mib5m0Aw_9 0 I HAVE OUR CRAW FISH HERE AND I'M GOING TO ADD THIS IN AND THAT IS THE SEASONED CRAW FISH WITH THE FAT AND EVERYTHING A LOT OF FLAVOR SO LETS MIX THE CRAW FISH UP IN THERE
G47Mib5m0Aw_10 0 NOW THAT WE HAVE THIS IN GO AHEAD AND MIX IT UP GOOD AND MIX IT UP WE ARE THEN GOING TO PUT OUR TOP BACK ON AND LET IT SIMMER FOR ANOTHER TEN MINUTES
G47Mib5m0Aw_11 0 IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT THAT LONG ALL WE WANT FOR THOSE SHRIMP AND CRAW FISH TO HEAT THROUGH WITH THIS
G47Mib5m0Aw_12 0 SO WE ARE GOING TO COVER IT BACK UP AND GIVE IT ABOUT TEN MORE MINUTES AND SEE WHAT WE GOT
gj3v4r6Lb-U_1 0 IN THIS CLIP I M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PROPERLY UNLOAD YOUR FIREARM YOUR GLOCK 31 PISTOL
gj3v4r6Lb-U_2 0 IF YOU NOTICE WHEN YOU APPROACH THIS FIREARM YOU SEE THAT THE ACTION IS CLOSED AND YOU DON'T KNOW IF IT'S LOADED OR NOT
gj3v4r6Lb-U_3 0 FOR THAT MATTER THERE IS NO ACTUAL HAMMER TO SEE IF IT'S COCKED OR NOT
gj3v4r6Lb-U_4 0 SO WHEN YOU APPROACH THIS FIREARM YOU'RE GOING TO ALWAYS APPROACH IT WITH THE MINDSET THAT IT'S LOADED
gj3v4r6Lb-U_5 0 THE WAY THAT YOU WOULD OPEN AND CLEAR AND UNLOAD THIS GLOCK 31 WOULD BE YOU WOULD FIRST AND FOREMOST
gj3v4r6Lb-U_6 0 YOU WOULD PICK UP THE FIREARM WITHOUT TOUCHING THE TRIGGER KEEPING YOUR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER AT ALL TIMES
gj3v4r6Lb-U_7 0 SECONDLY YOU WILL TAKE THE FIREARM AND PUSH IN ON THE MAGAZINE RELEASE RIGHT HERE TAKING THE MAGAZINE OUT OF THE FIREARM
gj3v4r6Lb-U_8 0 THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT THAT WHEN YOU DO OPEN THE SLIDE AND IF THE SLIDE GOES BACK FORWARD NO ROUNDS WILL COME OUT OF THE MAGAZINE AND GO INTO THE FIREARM CHAMBER
gj3v4r6Lb-U_9 0 AT THAT POINT WHAT YOU WILL DO IS YOU WILL TAKE THE SLIDE AND PULL THE SLIDE BACK
gj3v4r6Lb-U_10 0 DID YOU NOTICE THAT
gj3v4r6Lb-U_11 0 WHEN I PULL THE SLIDE BACK IT DON'T LOCK BACK SO YOU WANT TO PUSH UP ON THIS SLIDE STOP RIGHT ON THE SIDE SO WHEN I PULL THE SLIDE BACK PUSH UP ON THE SLIDE STOP
gj3v4r6Lb-U_12 0 IT LOCKS THE SLIDE BACK IN THE OPEN POSITION
gj3v4r6Lb-U_13 0 AT THAT POINT IF YOU LOOK CLOSER HERE YOU ALSO GO TO THAT STEP AND MAKE A VISUAL AND PHYSICAL INSPECTION OF THE CHAMBER MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S NO ROUNDS IN THE CHAMBER
gj3v4r6Lb-U_14 0 THAT IS THE WAY THAT YOU UNLOAD YOUR GLOCK 31 PISTOL
hfGc42uMJxk_1 0 HI THIS IS ROD ZERVAKOS ISSA CERTIFIED PERSONAL TRAINER ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE

hfGc42uMJxk_3 0 WE'VE DONE OUR CHEST BACK ARMS AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON OUR TRICEPS
hfGc42uMJxk_4 0 THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS A PUSH DOWN WITH THE BAR AND NOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO WORK ON IS ACTUALLY A CLOSED GRIP BENCH PRESS SO THE BENCH NATURALLY IS WIDE GRIP YOU PUSH UP YOU USE YOUR PEC MUSCLES TO BRING YOUR ARMS FORWARD AND WE ARE GOING TO CLOSE THAT GRIP AND CONCENTRATE ON PUSHING WITH OUR TRICEPS
hfGc42uMJxk_5 0 THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS LEAN BACK USE A WEIGHT THAT IS RESPONSIBLE THAT YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH

hfGc42uMJxk_7 0 AGAIN IF YOU ARE DOING THESE PROPERLY YOU ARE GOING TO FEEL A LOT OF STRETCH IN THE ELBOWS OR TRICEPS RATHER NOT SO MUCH IN THE CHEST
hfGc42uMJxk_8 0 YOU ARE ALWAYS GOING TO FEEL A BIT THERE BECAUSE THIS IS A CHEST EXERCISE BUT THIS IS A GREAT ONE FOR ISOLATING THE TRICEPS ON THE BENCH PRESS
GU96yOfHcd4_1 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO FINISH OFF SHERRY'S LOOK WITH A LIP GLOSS
GU96yOfHcd4_2 0 SO WE'RE JUST ABOUT FINISHED WITH SHERRY'S LOOK BUT YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING'S PRETTY SYMMETRICAL WE'VE GOT OUR BLUSH WE'VE GOT ALL OF OUR EYE PRODUCTS WE ALSO HAVE THAT LIP STAIN ON THERE SO NOW WE'RE JUST GOING TO FINISH UP WITH THAT LIP GLOSS AND HER LOOK IS COMPLETE SO I AM GOING TO USE A LIP BRUSH FOR THIS
GU96yOfHcd4_3 0 WITH MOST GLOSSES THE BRUSH COMES WITH THE GLOSS SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT TOO MUCH
GU96yOfHcd4_4 0 BUT I LIKE TO USE A BRUSH BECAUSE IT GIVES A REALLY REALLY POLISHED LOOK SO I'M GOING TO START RIGHT FROM THE MIDDLE OF HER LIP AND YOU CAN SEE THIS IS A REALLY REALLY BRIGHT PINK BUT ONCE AGAIN THIS ACTUALLY BLENDING IN WITH HER CHEEK COLOR

GU96yOfHcd4_7 0 THAT IS SO PRETTY ON YOU OH MY GOSH
GU96yOfHcd4_8 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE A LIP PRIMER IF YOU WANT TO ESPECIALLY FOR USING SUCH VIBRANT COLORS
GU96yOfHcd4_9 0 SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE A TENDENCY TO BLEED OR FOR THEIR LIPS OR THEIR COLOR TO BLEED SO YOU CAN USE A PRIMER FIRST AND BASICALLY THAT'S JUST GOING TO HELP TO CREATE A BARRIER SO YOUR LIP PRODUCTS ARE NOT GOING TO MOVE THROUGH OUT THE DAY
GU96yOfHcd4_10 0 BUT I USED THIS STAIN ON SHERRY AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH GOING TO DO THE TRICK
GU96yOfHcd4_11 0 GO AHEAD AND JUST PRESS FOR ME REALLY QUICKLY THERE YOU GO
GU96yOfHcd4_12 0 ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A GLOSS OR A LIP COLOR ON TOO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE NOT TO RUB YOUR LIPS TOGETHER
GU96yOfHcd4_13 0 AND THAT'S A REALLY COMMON THING FOR PEOPLE TO DO AND I USED TO DO THAT TOO BUT A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU DO THAT IT PUSHES THE LIP COLOR OUT AND YOU END UP HAVING TO APPLY IT MANY MORE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY SO TRY TO JUST GET USED TO PRESSING TOGETHER GO AHEAD AND PRESS AGAIN AND IT'S GOING TO HELP TO BLEND ALL THAT COLOR TOGETHER BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO MOVE YOUR GLOSS

gDpytEBQPGQ_1 0 LET'S TALK ABOUT TREATING A CAT WITH MATTED FUR
gDpytEBQPGQ_2 0 LONG HAIRED CATS VERY EASILY MAT THEIR FUR ESPECIALLY AROUND THE REAR LEGS UNDER THE TAIL ON THE BELLY
gDpytEBQPGQ_3 0 A LOT OF THESE CATS CANNOT GET TO THEIR HAIR FULLY AND GROOM THEMSELVES AND PREVENT MATS AND SO YOU MAY HAVE TO HELP YOUR LONG HAIRED CAT PREVENT OR TREAT THOSE MATS AS IN GETTING RID OF THEM
gDpytEBQPGQ_4 0 PREVENTION IS THE KEY SO WORK WITH A GROOMER OR YOUR VETERINARY CLINIC TO KEEP THESE CATS TRIMMED AND BRUSHED OUT
gDpytEBQPGQ_5 0 THEY CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT
gDpytEBQPGQ_6 0 SOME CATS WITH MATS ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE SEDATED BECAUSE IT HURTS AND YOU NEVER WANT TO ATTEMPT GETTING MATS OUT WITH SCISSORS AT HOME
gDpytEBQPGQ_7 0 THAT ALWAYS TURNS INTO PROBLEMS BECAUSE MATS ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE SKIN
gDpytEBQPGQ_8 0 THEIR SKIN IS VERY THIN AND CUTTING THAT SKIN IS VERY VERY EASILY DONE AND SO THERE ARE SOME COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS SUCH AS MAT STRIPPERS THAT YOU CAN USE TO GRAB THESE MATS AND GENTLY PULL THEM OUT
gDpytEBQPGQ_9 0 THAT USUALLY DOESN'T DAMAGE THE SKIN SO TALK TO YOUR VETERINARY CLINIC OR YOUR GROOMER ABOUT THAT
gDpytEBQPGQ_10 0 THESE CAN WORK QUITE WELL

gN3-q5r8n-I_3 0 LIVING EARTH MASSAGE TABLES ARE FOUND IN SOME OF THE HIGHEST-END SPAS IN THE WORLD
gN3-q5r8n-I_4 0 THEY'RE THOUGHT OF TO BE AS KIND OF THE ROLLS ROYCE OF MASSAGE EQUIPMENT
gN3-q5r8n-I_5 0 THEY PARTNER WITH MANY DIFFERENT COMPANIES TO BRING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO THEIR TABLES
gN3-q5r8n-I_6 0 FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE PARTNERED WITH AN A SOUND THERAPY COMPANY TO INCORPORATE SOUND WAVE THERAPY INTO THEIR TABLES
gN3-q5r8n-I_7 0 SO THAT YOU CAN USE THAT DURING YOUR TREATMENTS
gN3-q5r8n-I_8 0 THEY HAVE BEAUTIFUL BUILT BEAUTIFULLY BUILT DESIGNS REALLY LOOKING LUXURIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL IN YOUR SPA

GF_NGKAZ6Uw_1 0 HI I'M JOE CUENCO WITH FAMILY RESOURCES
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_2 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HEALING RELATIONSHIPS
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_3 0 SPECIFICALLY HOW DO WE GET OUR SPOUSE TO TRUST YOU AGAIN
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_4 0 WELL WHAT IS AT THE HEART OF GETTING OUR SPOUSE TO TRUST US AGAIN
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_5 0 WELL AT FIRST WE REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS AT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE TRUST ISSUE
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_6 0 IS IT SOME BEHAVIOR
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_7 0 WAS IT A BREACH OF TRUST SUCH AS HAVING AN AFFAIR OR IS IT LYING OR SOMETHING ELSE
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_8 0 OR IS YOUR SPOUSE HIDING SOMETHING
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_9 0 YOU KNOW THAT THAT YOU'RE PICKING UP ON
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_10 0 SO REALISTICALLY WHAT IS AT THE ROOT OF BEHAVIOR
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_11 0 IS IT UNSATISFYING SEX OR THE PHYSICAL ISSUES OR ARE THERE OTHER THINGS GOING ON THAT'S CREATING SOMEWHAT OF A BREACH OF TRUST OR THIS BREACH OF BEHAVIOR
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_12 0 THE FIRST THING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS FULL COMMUNICATION FOLD AND HONEST DIALOGUE NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_13 0 THERE HAS TO BE A FULL ACCOUNTING OF THESE BEHAVIORS
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_14 0 IF YOU'RE SPOUSE IS COMING CLEAN AND SAYING I DID HAVE AN AFFAIR OR I DID LIE ABOUT THE SITUATION I'M SORRY THEN THERE'S AN OPTION FOR YOU TO MOVE ON THE RELATIONSHIP
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_15 0 BUT IF SOMEBODY WHO IS OFFENDED THE OTHER PARTY IN THE RELATIONSHIP THAT PERSON HAS TO ASK FOR FORGIVENESS
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_16 0 THAT PERSON HAS TO AGREE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE BEHAVIORS WON'T BE ENGAGE IN AGAIN
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_17 0 AND THEY'RE MAYBE OTHER PATTERNS HERE EXCESSIVE DRINKING DRUGS OR SOME OTHER ADDICTIONS THAT NEED TO NEED TO BE DEALT WITH THAT'LL HELP THAT TRUST TO BE TO BE BUILD UP UPON AGAIN
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_18 0 SO TRUST IS A ACCORDING TO SUCCESSFUL COUPLES IS A PARAMOUNT ISSUE IN THE RELATIONSHIP
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_19 0 AS A MATTER OF FACT TRUST IS THE FIRST GATE
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_20 0 FRIENDSHIP RESPECT AND ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS ARE REALLY SEQUENTIAL TO TRUST
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_21 0 AND SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE TRUST IN RELATIONSHIP IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ANYTHING ELSE TO FOLLOW IN A STRONG LONG TERM MANNER
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_22 0 WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT SOME PEOPLE JUST WILL NOT CHANGE BEHAVIORS OR THE SOWING GRAIN IS GOING TO BE TOUGH FOR THEM TO CHANGE
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_23 0 AND YOU MAY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE ONGOING OR MAKE A DECISION THAT THIS RELATIONSHIP IS NOT FOR YOU
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_24 0 THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS THERE FAMILY RESOURCES OFFERS WORKSHOPS THERE'S MARRIAGE EDUCATION THERE'S COUNSELING TO HELP FOLKS WORK THROUGH TRUST ISSUES AND HOW TO RECOVER FROM SITUATION THAT CAUSE THE PROBLEM
GF_NGKAZ6Uw_25 0 AND THAT'S HOW WE GET OUR SPOUSE TO TRUST US AGAIN

gt8UTJAB9Tc_7 0 IF IT'S A FRIENDLY GAME OR THE COACHES COME UP WITH SOME TYPE OF AGREEMENT THEY DON'T MIND HOW MANY SUBSTITUTIONS THERE ARE THEN THE RULES CAN BE BENT A LITTLE BIT TO WHERE YOU CAN DO AS MANY SUBSTITUTION AS YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO

GiFlffXVkvw_21 0 IT'S A MATTER OF YOUR DOG GOING FROM ONE DIRECTION YOU'RE TAKING FIRST HAND AND SWITCHING HIS PATH SO THAT HE LEARNS TO GO AND FOLLOW THE NEXT ARM
GiFlffXVkvw_22 0 IT'S JUST HERE TO HERE YOU'RE CHANGING YOUR FOOT WORK AND YOUR HAND POSITION

gosCYV0wqAE_2 0 I'M PETE BELLESSIS AND I'M AN ART TEACHER AND TODAY I REPRESENT EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
gosCYV0wqAE_3 0 TODAY WE ARE GOING TO BE DRAWING AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DRAW
gosCYV0wqAE_4 0 LIKE ANY WRITER USUALLY WILL CHOOSE SOMETHING HE OR SHE WANTS TO WRITE ABOUT WE NEED TO BE THE SAME WAY WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DRAW
gosCYV0wqAE_5 0 IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE ARE PASSIONATE OR EXCITED ABOUT BECAUSE IF NOT WE ARE GOING TO LOSE INTEREST QUICKLY AND ABANDON OUR ATTEMPTS TO DRAWING SOMETHING
gosCYV0wqAE_6 0 IF I GO BACK IN MY MEMORY FAR BACK AND THINK OF SOME THE EARLIEST THINGS I STARTED DRAWING I THINK OF ANIMALS
gosCYV0wqAE_7 0 I THINK OF FAMILY PETS AND I ALSO THINK OF AUTOMOBILES BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN THEM
gosCYV0wqAE_8 0 SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO DRAW AND THEN WE NEED TO CONSIDER WHERE WE ARE GOING TO BE DRAWING AND WHERE WE ARE GOING TO SET UP
gosCYV0wqAE_9 0 FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WERE DOING A LANDSCAPE DRAWING WHICH WE ARE NOT TODAY YOU WOULD WANT TO BE OUTSIDE AND THE SAME GOES FOR NATURAL TYPE DRAWINGS IN THE FIELD IF YOU WILL WITH WILD ANIMALS OR MAYBE THE DOMESTIC CAT THAT JUST FROM THE RIGHT PROSPECTIVE KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A WILD TIGER
gosCYV0wqAE_10 0 ANOTHER LITTLE TRICK IS MAYBE WORK FROM A PHOTOGRAPH OR PHOTOGRAPHS
gosCYV0wqAE_11 0 THE SAME CAN BE APPLIED TO BOTH FIGURE STUDIES HUMANS IF YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE CONVENIENT MODEL LIKE YOUR MOM AROUND OR A SIBLING OR AUTOMOBILES SOMETHING THAT I HAVE ALSO DRAWN SINCE I WAS LITTLE
gosCYV0wqAE_12 0 YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO HAVE ECSTATIC EXAMPLE ON YOUR DRIVEWAY OR PARKED ON THE STREET
gosCYV0wqAE_13 0 A LOT OF THIS STUFF CAN COME FROM YOU GUESSED IT RIGHT UP HERE
gosCYV0wqAE_14 0 BUT IT IS IMPORTANT AGAIN TO REMEMBER THAT YOU SHOULD DRAW SOMETHING THAT INTERESTS YOU AND THAT COULD COME FROM YOUR TRAVELS COME FROM JUST DAY IN AND DAY OUT ACTIVITIES DRIVING IN TOWN LOOKING UP AT ARCHITECTURE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAYS AND NOTICING OTHER CARS
gosCYV0wqAE_15 0 SO FIND YOUR SUBJECT LAY OUT YOUR AREA AND LET'S GET READY TO BEGIN
HbMwPncW-S0_1 0 SO THE NEXT EXERCISE IN THE SERIES TO REALLY GET THE CORE STRONGER AND THE LOWER BACK IS CALLED THE SUPERMAN OR I LIKE TO CALL IT THE SUPER PERSON JUST TO BE PC WHAT ABOUT WOMEN YOU KNOW
HbMwPncW-S0_2 0 SO ANYWAY THE SUPER PERSON IS DONE WHY YOU'RE LYING ON YOUR STOMACH AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO LIFT YOUR HANDS AND YOU'RE LIFT YOUR LEGS AND YOU'LL FEEL IT ALL ALONG YOUR BACK BUT YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO ENGAGE THE CORE WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS
HbMwPncW-S0_3 0 WHEN YOU'RE ENGAGING THE CORE YOU'RE REALLY CONTROLLING THE MUSCLES AND YOU RE CONTRACTING AND YOU'RE REALLY WORKING THIS SET OF MUSCLES TO GET IT STRONGER
HbMwPncW-S0_4 0 SO I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE HOW WE DO THIS
HbMwPncW-S0_5 0 LIE ON YOUR MAT HANDS IN FRONT OF YOU LEGS BEHIND YOU KEEP YOUR LEGS ABOUT HIP WIDTH APART AND SO STARTING POSITION IS HERE AND WE LIFT UP HOLD IT AND LOWER LIFT UP HOLD AND LOWER
HbMwPncW-S0_6 0 YOU WANT TO HOLD IT ABOUT THREE TO FIVE SECONDS OR MORE IN THE UP POSITION AND LOWER
HbMwPncW-S0_7 0 AND YOU'RE REALLY CONTRACTING YOUR WHOLE BODY

HbMwPncW-S0_10 0 IT'S A GOOD ALL OVER BODY TONING AND STRENGTHENING EXERCISE
gsNEiNEnHV4_1 0 CLANCY ROSE SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO YOUR ESPRESSO GRINDERS THAT YOU USE TO GRIND YOUR BEANS
gsNEiNEnHV4_2 0 RIGHT HERE I HAVE ONE EXAMPLE OF A HOME ESPRESSO GRINDER AND HOW IT WORKS IS YOU HAVE YOUR HOPPER HERE WHERE YOU THROW YOUR BEANS INTO
gsNEiNEnHV4_3 0 IT DROPS DOWN INTO THE AREA WHERE IT'S ACTUALLY GROUND
gsNEiNEnHV4_4 0 IT SPITS IT OUT INTO THE DOSING CHAMBER HERE
gsNEiNEnHV4_5 0 ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE DOSING CHAMBER I HAVE A LEVER TO PULL THE COFFEE OUT OF THE DOSING CHAMBER
gsNEiNEnHV4_6 0 WE HAVE A REST HERE TO LATER ON WE'LL BE RESTING THE PORTA FILTER THERE TO DOSE COFFEE INTO THE PORTA FILTER BASKET
gsNEiNEnHV4_7 0 AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OVER HERE AS WELL I HAVE A SWITCH TO TURN ON THE ESPRESSO GRINDER
gsNEiNEnHV4_8 0 ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS THAT AFFECTS ESPRESSO SHOTS IS THE COARSENESS OF THE GRIND AND THAT AFFECTS THE TIME OF THE SHOTS ON THIS ESPRESSO GRINDER AS MARKED HERE ON THE GRINDER
gsNEiNEnHV4_9 0 YOU TURN THIS LITTLE METAL COLLAR COUNTERCLOCKWISE TO GRIND THE COFFEE MORE FINE AND CLOCKWISE TO GRIND IT MORE COARSE
gsNEiNEnHV4_10 0 WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE IS THE FINER THE COFFEE IS GROUND THE MORE RESISTANCE THAT IT'S CREATING FOR THE WATER WHEN IT PASSES THROUGH DURING THE EXTRACTION PROCESS OF THE ESPRESSO SHOTS
gsNEiNEnHV4_11 0 IF YOUR COFFEE IS GROUND COARSER THEN THE LESS RESISTANCE THE WATER HAS THE FASTER THE ESPRESSO SHOTS ARE GOING TO TAKE AND THE LESS TIME THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE TO PULL THE SHOT
gsNEiNEnHV4_12 0 THE FINER THE COFFEE IS THE LONGER THE WATER IS GOING TO TAKE TO PASS THROUGH THE COFFEE BEFORE THE ESPRESSO SHOT
gsNEiNEnHV4_13 0 SO IF YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT I GUESS A SMALLER HOME GRINDER LIKE THIS ONE HERE BASICALLY ALL YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS FILL UP THAT WITH THE ESPRESSO BEANS AND PUT THE TOP ON IT AND BEGIN GRINDING THE BEANS
gsNEiNEnHV4_14 0 THE ONLY WAY TO CONTROL COFFEE COARSENESS THE GRIND COARSENESS ON A GRINDER LIKE THIS IS BY TIME OF THE GRIND
gsNEiNEnHV4_15 0 SO BASICALLY ESPRESSO GRINDS ARE JUST A WHOLE LOT FINER THAN YOUR DRIP COFFEE AND ONE GUIDELINE TO GO BY IS MAYBE GRINDING ABOUT TWENTY SECONDS WITH A GRINDER LIKE THIS
gsNEiNEnHV4_16 0 YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GRIND A LITTLE WAYS LONGER THAN HOME DRIP COFFEE TO MAKE A COFFEE A LITTLE BIT FINER

G7zu6UH0QoM_1 0 CLANCY ROSE THE NEXT THING THAT I'M TALKING IS YOUR ESPRESSO GRINDERS
G7zu6UH0QoM_2 0 AND SO LIKE IF WE HAVE A HOME ESPRESSO GRINDER LIKE THIS ONE HERE YOU HAVE YOUR HOPPER WHERE THE COFFEE GOES INTO AND IT FEEDS INTO WHERE THE COFFEE IS GROUND SPITS IT INTO THE DOSING CHAMBER
G7zu6UH0QoM_3 0 IN THE RIGHT HAND SIDE WE HAVE THE LEVER THAT CONTROLS THE DOSING CHAMBER AND THE SWITCH TO TURN IT ON
G7zu6UH0QoM_4 0 YOU HAVE A REST DOWN HERE TO REST THE PORTAFILTER ON WHILE YOU'RE DOSING THE COFFEE INTO THE PORTAFILTER
G7zu6UH0QoM_5 0 ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT GOES INTO THE ESPRESSO PREPARATION PROCESS IS THE COARSENESS OF THE GRINDS THAT YOU'RE USING FOR THE ESPRESSO SHOTS
G7zu6UH0QoM_6 0 ON A GRINDER LIKE THIS HOW YOU CONTROL THAT IS AS IT'S MARKED HERE ON THE GRINDER COUNTER-CLOCKWISE GRINDS THE COFFEE FINER AND CLOCKWISE GRINDS THE COFFEE COARSER
G7zu6UH0QoM_7 0 WHEN YOU'RE GRINDING THE COFFEE FINER IT'S CREATING MORE RESISTANCE FOR THE WATER WHEN IT'S PASSING THROUGH AND EXTRACTING THE COFFEE FOR THE SHOT OF ESPRESSO
G7zu6UH0QoM_8 0 IF YOU'RE CREATING MORE RESISTANCE THEN THE SHOT IS GOING TO PULL SLOWER OR TAKE LONGER TO PULL AND THE COARSE OF THE COFFEE IS THEN THE LESS RESISTANCE THAT THE WATER HAS AND THE QUICKER THE SHOTS YOU ARE GOING TO PULL
G7zu6UH0QoM_9 0 IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THE SMALLER HOME BLADE GRINDERS THAT YOU'RE USING TO GRIND YOUR COFFEE FOR YOUR ESPRESSO THEN ALL YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS PUT THE COFFEE IN THERE LIKE NORMAL AND WHEN YOU HIT THE BUTTON TO START GRINDING THE COFFEE THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU HAVE TO CONTROL HOW FINE YOU'RE GRINDING YOUR COFFEE IS BY THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT YOU GRIND THE COFFEE
G7zu6UH0QoM_10 0 FOR ESPRESSO ONE GUIDELINE TO GO BY IS IT'S TWENTY SECONDS OR MORE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP THE GRINDER ON TO GRIND THE COFFEE
G7zu6UH0QoM_11 0 IT'S GOING TO BE CONSIDERABLY FINER THAN A NORMAL CUP OF COFFEE
GIkXnMUo4wQ_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS KAREN LOCASALE AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT CRAFTING WITH GOURDS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_2 0 COLORING YOUR GOURDS OK THERE'S LOT'S OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO COLOR YOUR GOURDS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_3 0 AND SOME OF THE THINGS YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT FIRST IS WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO PAINT THE INSIDE OF YOUR DESIGN FIRST OR WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE OUTSIDE OF THE GOURD OR HOW MUCH IS GONNA BE THE NATURAL GOURD IS SHOWING
GIkXnMUo4wQ_4 0 BUT SOME OF THE THINGS YOU CAN USE TO DO THIS THIS PARTICULAR GOURD HAS BEEN THE GOURD ITSELF IS STAINED WITH LEATHER DYES THE COLOR IN HERE THAT YOU SEE HAS BEEN DONE WITH ACRYLIC JUST YOUR BASIC ACRYLIC PAINTS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_5 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE WOOD STAINS WOODS STAINS WORK VERY WELL FOR DOING AN OVERALL GOURD
GIkXnMUo4wQ_6 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE SHOE POLISH WORKS VERY WELL TO GET A NICE SHINE AND SOME COLORING ON IT
GIkXnMUo4wQ_7 0 FOR YOUR DESIGNS AND SOME OF THE FINER WORK YOU CAN USE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A PERMANENT MAGIC MARKER
GIkXnMUo4wQ_8 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE WHAT THEY HAVE OUT ON THE MARKET NOW THEY'RE CALLED PAINT PENS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_9 0 PAINT PENTS WORK REALLY WELL
GIkXnMUo4wQ_10 0 THERE'S ALSO THE DYES THAT YOU USE FOR RUBBER STAMPING THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT DYES OUT THERE FOR THAT THAT WORK
GIkXnMUo4wQ_11 0 THERE'S ALSO FABRIC DYES THEY DON'T WORK REAL WELL BUT YOU CAN AGAIN EXPERIMENT WITH ANY OF THESE
GIkXnMUo4wQ_12 0 THE BEST THING TO DO IF YOU GO TO LIKE A GOURD FARM TO BUY YOUR GOURDS THEY ALMOST ALWAYS WILL GIVE YOU THE BROKEN AND BITS AND PIECES OF THE GOURD
GIkXnMUo4wQ_13 0 THOSE ARE ALWAYS GOOD TO PICK UP BECAUSE YOU CAN USE THOSE AS YOUR PRACTICE PIECES TO SEE HOW YOUR COLORING IS GOING TO LOOK HOW THE DYE IS GOING TO WORK WITH YOUR ACRYLICS AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO INTERACT
GIkXnMUo4wQ_14 0 AND AGAIN YOUR SHADING AND IS IT GOING TO BE THE COLOR THAT YOU WANT IS IT TOO DARK IS IT TOO LIGHT
GIkXnMUo4wQ_15 0 SOMETHING ELSE TO KEEP IN MIND WITH YOUR LEATHER DYES THE LEATHER DYES WILL FADE OVER TIME
GIkXnMUo4wQ_16 0 THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO TRY TO PREVENT THAT ONE BEING DO YOUR ACRYLIC SEALANT ONCE YOUR PROJECT IS DONE
GIkXnMUo4wQ_17 0 BUT THEY STILL EVEN WITH THAT THE LEATHER DYES WILL TEND TO FADE OVER TIME
GIkXnMUo4wQ_18 0 THE WOOD STAINS LAST A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND THEY'VE GOT A PRODUCT OUT THERE NOW CALLED A GOURD INK DYE THAT IS MORE COLOR FAST
GIkXnMUo4wQ_19 0 SO YOU CAN AGAIN GO VERY VERY SIMPLE WITH YOUR JUST BASIC ACRYLIC PAINTS AND MAGIC MARKERS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_20 0 LEATHER DYES THESE COME ABOUT FOUR FOUR-FIFTY A BOTTLE LOT OF DIFFERENT COLORS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_21 0 WOOD STAINS YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE LAYING AROUND THE HOUSE SHOW POLISH YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE LYING AROUND THE HOUSE SO LOTS OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO ACTUALLY GETTING SOME COLOR ON YOUR GOURD
HBbFaTK359U_1 0 EDIT SMOOTHING IS A PROCESS WHERE AFTER YOU HAVE QUANTIZE SOMETHING THERE MIGHT BE LITTLE GAPS IN BETWEEN THE AUDIO FILES AND LITTLE SPACES BETWEEN YOUR REGIONS
HBbFaTK359U_2 0 SO WHAT EDIT SMOOTHING DOES IT APPLIES CROSS PHASE IN BETWEEN EACH OF THOSE JUST TO ALLOW FOR SMOOTH TRANSITIONS AND JUST A BETTER SOUND ALL TOGETHER
HBbFaTK359U_3 0 SO WITH THE EDIT SMOOTHING AS LONG AS I CONFORMED TO MY REGIONS AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS QUANTIZED THE WAY I WANT IT NOW I CAN CHOOSE EDIT SMOOTHING AND I CAN FILL THE GAPS OR I CAN FILL THE GAPS WITH CROSS PHASE
HBbFaTK359U_4 0 SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO FILL THE GAPS WITH CROSS PHASE AND MOVE THEM AT FIVE MILO-SECONDS AND THEN SMOOTH IT
HBbFaTK359U_5 0 WHAT THIS DOES IS GOING TO REALLY SMOOTH MY WHOLE TRACK UP SO THAT ALL THE GAPS ARE SEAMLESS AND THERE'S NO REAL TYPE OF BREAKS OR ANY TYPE OF LIKE PAUSES WITHIN THE TRACK
HBbFaTK359U_6 0 YOU GO TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU DO THIS AS WELL LIKE THAT THE GAPS- THE GAPS SOME OF THEM MIGHT NOT SOUND EXACTLY THE WAY YOU WANT IT
HBbFaTK359U_7 0 SO WHEN YOU DO IT YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU LISTEN TO IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S RIGHT AND IT SOUND THE WAY THAT YOU WANT IT
gNEk8QqEOY0_1 0 I'M LES WHITLEY
gNEk8QqEOY0_2 0 HERE TODAY TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TONING THE INNER THIGHS
gNEk8QqEOY0_3 0 THE FIRST THING I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS IS SPECIFICALLY ISOLATING ASPECTS OR ANGLES OF THE MUSCLE ESPECIALLY THE LOWER BODY
gNEk8QqEOY0_4 0 TO TONE THE INNER THIGH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MUSCLE THAT'S TYPICALLY NOT MUCH BIGGER THAN THE SIZE OF BIG AROUND OF MY FINGER
gNEk8QqEOY0_5 0 THE MUSCLE OF THE INNER THIGHS ARE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING THE LEG INTO THE MIDLINE OF THE BODY OR ADDUCTION THINK OF ADDING TO THE INSIDE
gNEk8QqEOY0_6 0 SO TYPICALLY YOU MAY SEE SOMEONE LYING ON THEIR SIDE DOING INSIDE LEG RAISES OR MACHINE TO TRAIN THAT MUSCLE
gNEk8QqEOY0_7 0 AGAIN THAT MUSCLE BEING WHAT IT IS IS VERY SMALL
gNEk8QqEOY0_8 0 SO TO OVER TRAIN OR TRAIN IT TO MAKE IT STRONG WON'T TAKE A LOT OF EFFORT
gNEk8QqEOY0_9 0 OVERALL TYPICALLY THE RESPONSE OF TONING THIGHS IS TO GIVE THEM MORE MUSCULAR APPEARANCE REMOVING THE BODY FAT
gNEk8QqEOY0_10 0 THAT REQUIRES PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO BURN CALORIES OR EXPEND CALORIES AS WELL AS MODIFYING THE DIETARY INTAKE
gNEk8QqEOY0_11 0 ONE EXERCISE FOR TRAINING THE OVERALL MUSCULATURE OF THE LEGS NOT ONLY THE INNER THIGH BUT OUTER THIGH FRONT OF THE THIGH BACK OF THE THIGH AS WELL AS THE HIPS IS THE SQUAT
gNEk8QqEOY0_12 0 THE BASIC SQUAT WILL BEGIN BY ADDRESSING THE BAR HANDS EVEN STEPPING UNDERNEATH BALANCING THE WEIGHT ACROSS THE UPPER PART OF THE BACK LOWER PART OF THE SHOULDERS
gNEk8QqEOY0_13 0 FEET CAN BE ARRANGED IN A VARIETY OF POSITIONS
gNEk8QqEOY0_14 0 TOES POINTED OUT WILL SLIGHTLY EMPHASIZE MORE THE INNER ASPECT OF THE THIGH
gNEk8QqEOY0_15 0 THIS COMMONLY REFERRED TO IN DANCING IS A PLIE SQUAT
gNEk8QqEOY0_16 0 KNEES WILL FOLLOW THE SAME DIRECTION OF THE TOES AS YOU LOWER YOURSELF DOWN UNDER GOOD CONTROL
gNEk8QqEOY0_17 0 TRYING TO MAINTAIN A UPRIGHT SPINE POSITION
gNEk8QqEOY0_18 0 TOES POINTED STRAIGHT AHEAD WILL WORK MORE OUTER ASPECTS OF THE THIGHS BUT EMPHASIZING SPECIFICALLY THE INNER
gNEk8QqEOY0_19 0 WORKING ON RANGE OF MOTION TOES POINTED SLIGHTLY OUT KNEES FOLLOWING SAME DIRECTION
gNEk8QqEOY0_20 0 GOOD CONTROL MOTION
gNEk8QqEOY0_21 0 ALL THE WAY UP ALL THE WAY DOWN
gNEk8QqEOY0_22 0 ALWAYS RACK THE BAR UNDER CONTROL
gNEk8QqEOY0_23 0 WE TRAIN THE LEG AS A WHOLE NOT EMPHASIZING ANY ONE PARTICULAR PART BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING FOR BALANCE OVERALL SHAPE AS WELL AS MUSCULARITY OF THE LEG WHILE HAVING A NICE LEAN LOOK AS WELL
GFasV9Lpgv0_1 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IN THE PORCELAIN PAINTING ANOTHER TOOL THAT WE USE CALLED THE WIPE OUT TOOL
GFasV9Lpgv0_2 0 AND YOU HAVE HARDER WIPE OUT TOOLS LIKE THIS AND YOU HAVE SOFTER ONES LIKE THIS
GFasV9Lpgv0_3 0 YOU HAVE A LITTLE MORE CONTROL WITH THE HARD ONES BUT ALL OF THEM HAVE THEIR USE
GFasV9Lpgv0_4 0 THIS ONE HAS THE WEDGED POINT VERY VERY SOFT
GFasV9Lpgv0_5 0 THIS ONE HAS THE HARDER SHARP POINT
GFasV9Lpgv0_6 0 AND THIS ONE AND THIS ONE ARE VERY SIMILAR EXCEPT THE BLUE IS MUCH FIRMER THAN THIS ONE
GFasV9Lpgv0_7 0 SO YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THE DIFFERENCE THERE
GFasV9Lpgv0_8 0 AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE SOME THAT ARE LIKE A FOAM RUBBER
GFasV9Lpgv0_9 0 AND YOU CAN DO A DIFFERENT TECHNIQUE WITH THAT
GFasV9Lpgv0_10 0 SO I'LL SHOW YOU QUICKLY HOW WE USE THE WIPE OUT TOOLS
GFasV9Lpgv0_11 0 FOR INSTANCE ON THIS TO SHAPE FLOWER PETALS OR LEAVES AND YOU CAN ALSO MAKE DESIGNS LIKE THIS
GFasV9Lpgv0_12 0 AND THEN YOU COME BACK WITH YOUR BRUSH AND YOU START AT THAT AND YOU CAN WIPE OUT LIKE THAT
GFasV9Lpgv0_13 0 IT CAN GIVE YOU A NICE CLEAR EDGE TO START WITH
GFasV9Lpgv0_14 0 THE THING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT PORCELAIN PAINTING IS IT IS SIMILAR TO WATERCOLOR PAINTING
GFasV9Lpgv0_15 0 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE HIGHLIGHTS THAT YOU WANT IN BEFORE YOU FIRE BECAUSE YOU CANNOT GET THEM BACK
GFasV9Lpgv0_16 0 SO GENERALLY ON THE FIRST FIRE YOU CONCENTRATE ON GETTING THE SHAPE OF YOUR PAINTING IN AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO HAVE ALL THE HIGHLIGHTS WHERE YOU WANT THEM AND THE LIGHTNESS THAT YOU WANT THEM BECAUSE YOU CANNOT GO BACK AND ADD PAINT ON TOP TO LIGHTEN THEM LIKE YOU DO WITH OIL PAINT OR ACRYLIC PAINT
GFasV9Lpgv0_17 0 SO IT'S JUST ALMOST REVERSED FROM ANY TYPE OF OIL PAINTING YOU MAY HAVE EVER DONE
GFasV9Lpgv0_18 0 AND THAT'S WHAT YOU USE THE WIPE OUT TOOLS AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO BLEND THIS
GFasV9Lpgv0_19 0 AND THE SYNTHETIC BRUSH IS TO CREATE THESE
GFasV9Lpgv0_20 0 SO THAT GIVES YOU AN EXAMPLE
GFasV9Lpgv0_21 0 ANOTHER THING THAT WE CAN USE AS A WIPE OUT TOOL IS SILK
GFasV9Lpgv0_22 0 THIS LOOKS REALLY BAD BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF PAINT ON IT BUT IT STILL WORKS GREAT
GFasV9Lpgv0_23 0 AND YOU CAN USE IT WRAPPED AROUND YOUR FINGER FOR A REAL SHARP WIPE OUT LIKE THIS
GFasV9Lpgv0_24 0 WE ALSO USE THE POLY-FIL
GFasV9Lpgv0_25 0 THIS IS WHAT'S USED IN PILLOWS YOU JUST GET IT IN ANY SEWING SHOP OR CRAFT SHOPS
GFasV9Lpgv0_26 0 YOU WRAP IT IN THE SILK LIKE THIS AND YOU CAN USE IT TO CLEAN AROUND YOUR PAINTING
GFasV9Lpgv0_27 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE IT FOR WIPE OUTS TO CREATE THINGS THAT YOU WANT IN A DIFFERENT MANNER
GFasV9Lpgv0_28 0 SO IT'S ANOTHER VERY GOOD TOOL
GFasV9Lpgv0_29 0 AND USUALLY WHEN WE ARE FINISHED WITH A PAINTING WE WILL GO AROUND AND CLEAN UP ALL THE EXCESS PAINT AROUND IT BECAUSE IF THE PAINT'S THERE IT'S GOING TO BE FIRED IN THE GLAZE
GFasV9Lpgv0_30 0 AND SO THAT IS SOME OF THE WIPE OUT TOOLS THAT WE USE
gJK0LpbTbEE_1 0 MY NAME IS ANTHONY MADDALONI AND I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT NIGHTTIME PHOTOGRAPHY LIGHTING EFFECTS
gJK0LpbTbEE_2 0 NOW NIGHTTIME PHOTOGRAPHY CAN BE VERY INTERESTING WITH THE SKYLINES AND THE CITIES AND ONE THING THAT I USED TO LIKE TO DO IS THAT I WOULD GO OVER AND I'D GET ON TOP OF A HIGH BUILDING AND I'D BE PHOTOGRAPHING A CERTAIN CITY
gJK0LpbTbEE_3 0 AND ONE THING ABOUT NIGHTTIME PHOTOGRAPHY IS IT'S LOW LIGHT SO THE SHUTTER SPEED THAT I WAS USING MIGHT BE VERY SLOW
gJK0LpbTbEE_4 0 SO A STRING OF CARS MOVING ALONG SIDE THE HIGHWAY CAN ACTUALLY LOOK JUST LIKE ONE BIG BLUR OF LIGHT COMING ALONG
gJK0LpbTbEE_5 0 NOW THAT'S ONE EFFECT OF NIGHTTIME PHOTOGRAPHY THAT YOU CAN UTILIZE TO YOUR ADVANTAGE TO MAKE AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING PICTURE
gJK0LpbTbEE_6 0 BY LEAVING THE SHUTTER OPEN IN ANY KIND OF MOVING LIGHT IS REALLY JUST GOING TO CAPTURE ONTO YOUR IMAGE LIKE IN A CERTAIN WAY
gJK0LpbTbEE_7 0 NEON OFTEN DOES THAT TOO
gJK0LpbTbEE_8 0 WHEN I PHOTOGRAPH SOMETIMES IN BARS OR IN RESTAURANTS IF I'M PHOTOGRAPHING YOU'LL ACTUALLY SEE THE BLUR OF THE NEON BEHIND MY SUBJECTS
gJK0LpbTbEE_9 0 AND I ALWAYS LIKE TO USE THAT EFFECT ALSO
gJK0LpbTbEE_10 0 ONE THING ABOUT NIGHTTIME PHOTOGRAPHY TOO THAT I ALWAYS THINK IS A REALLY FUN THING TO PLAY WITH SOMETIMES IS TO TURN THE LIGHTS OFF IN A ROOM AND EAVE YOUR SHUTTER OPEN ON YOUR CAMERA
gJK0LpbTbEE_11 0 AND YOU CAN MAYBE HAVE A FRIEND OR WHOEVER YOU'RE TAKING PICTURES OF ACTUALLY TRACE THE OUTLINE OF THEMSELVES WITH A SMALL PEN LIGHT
gJK0LpbTbEE_12 0 AND THEN IF YOU CLOSE THE SHUTTER YOU'LL ACTUALLY SEE THE IMAGE OF THAT PERSON ON YOUR CAMERA
gJK0LpbTbEE_13 0 THAT'S A REALLY FUN TRICK TO PLAY WITH DIGITAL CAMERAS WITH KIDS
gJK0LpbTbEE_14 0 I LIKE TO EXPLAIN PHOTOGRAPHY LIKE THAT TO PEOPLE SOMETIMES
gJK0LpbTbEE_15 0 AND THOSE ARE SOME INTERESTING NIGHTTIME EFFECTS THAT YOU CAN USE WITH PHOTOGRAPHY
GkoeDMrq0Kw_1 0 OK NOW I NEED WHITE FOR THE REST OF THE EYE
GkoeDMrq0Kw_2 0 SO TO CLEAN THE BRUSH I STICK THE BRUSH NOT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM JUST STICK IT IN THERE
GkoeDMrq0Kw_3 0 DON'T SWIRL IT AROUND AND WIPE OFF THE PAINT ONTO YOUR PAPER TOWEL
GkoeDMrq0Kw_4 0 THAT WAY YOUR SOLVENT WON'T GET DIRTY
GkoeDMrq0Kw_5 0 AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO REPLACE IT AS OFTEN
GkoeDMrq0Kw_6 0 IT STILL WILL GET DIRTY IT JUST WILL TAKE A LOT LONGER TO GET THERE THOUGH
GkoeDMrq0Kw_7 0 OK NOW SO I'M GOING TO GO INTO THE DIRECT WHITE
GkoeDMrq0Kw_8 0 YOU NOTICE THAT WHEN I PUT THE COLOR PICKED UP COLOR I JUST PICKED UP COLOR OFF OF PART OF THE WHITE NOT ALL OF IT
GkoeDMrq0Kw_9 0 SO I LEFT A LOT OF WHAT I CALL VIRGIN WHITE
GkoeDMrq0Kw_10 0 UNTOUCHED BY ANY OTHER COLORS
GkoeDMrq0Kw_11 0 AND I'M GOING TO PUT THE WHITE IN
GkoeDMrq0Kw_12 0 YOU SAY WELL THERE'S ALREADY WHITE CANVAS THERE
GkoeDMrq0Kw_13 0 YES BUT WE NEED SOME GRADATION IN THERE AS WELL TOO
GkoeDMrq0Kw_14 0 BECAUSE IT ISN'T ALL PERFECTLY WHITE
GkoeDMrq0Kw_15 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO PUT JUST A TOUCH OF BLACK IN THERE
haXRGGCMkcg_1 0 HI THIS IS MIKE LOPEZ WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
haXRGGCMkcg_2 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING MAGIC THE GATHERING THE CARD GAME
haXRGGCMkcg_3 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER STARTING A GAME
haXRGGCMkcg_4 0 AFTER YOU GET YOUR DECK WHICH YOU CAN BUY A STARTER DECK AT ANY HOBBY STORE THAT SELLS MAGIC THE GATHERING CARDS
haXRGGCMkcg_5 0 GRAB YOURSELF A DECK OR TWO GRAB A FRIEND AND HERE'S HOW YOU START
haXRGGCMkcg_6 0 YOU SHUFFLE THE CARDS WHICH YOU CAN SHUFFLE IN ANY NUMBER OF WAYS BUT THE MOST COMMON WAY IS JUST TO SHUFFLE LIKE YOU WERE DOING PLAYING CARDS
haXRGGCMkcg_7 0 SET THE DECK DOWN AND THEN YOU DRAW SEVEN CARDS FROM THE TOP AS YOU WOULD IN SAY GIN RUMMY
haXRGGCMkcg_8 0 FROM HERE AFTER YOU HAVE YOUR CARDS YOU CUT TO SEE WHO GOES FIRST
haXRGGCMkcg_9 0 THE CUT FOR THE NUMBER IS A CONVERTED MANA COST
haXRGGCMkcg_10 0 NOW SEE I HAVE A LAND
haXRGGCMkcg_11 0 NOW SAY YOUR OPPONENT CUTS AND HE HAS LAND ALSO
haXRGGCMkcg_12 0 THEN YOU WOULD CUT AGAIN
haXRGGCMkcg_13 0 I HAVE TWO
haXRGGCMkcg_14 0 NOW SAY YOUR OPPONENT CUTS AND HE HAS A LAND OR HE HAS A CONVERTED MANA COST LESS THAN TWO
haXRGGCMkcg_15 0 THEN IT WILL BE YOUR TURN TO GO FIRST
haXRGGCMkcg_16 0 HOWEVER AS WE CAN SEE HERE I HAVE SEVEN CARDS BUT NO LANDS
haXRGGCMkcg_17 0 IN THIS CASE YOU CAN TAKE A MULLIGAN SHUFFLE WHICH MEANS YOU PUT THE CARDS BACK IN THE DECK RESHUFFLE THE DECK
haXRGGCMkcg_18 0 HOWEVER YOU WANT SOME PEOPLE DO IT THIS WAY
haXRGGCMkcg_19 0 SOME PEOPLE DO THE OLD CLASSIC STYLE
haXRGGCMkcg_20 0 A LOT OF PLAYERS THAT COLLECT CARDS WON'T DO THE OLD CLASSIC STYLE BECAUSE IT BENDS THE CARDS BUT FOR TODAY WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO IT THIS WAY
haXRGGCMkcg_21 0 NOW AFTER TAKING A MULLIGAN SHUFFLE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DRAW SEVEN CARDS
haXRGGCMkcg_22 0 YOU ARE NOW ONLY ALLOWED TO DRAW SIX
haXRGGCMkcg_23 0 NOW THAT WE HAVE SIX CARDS AND THERE'S A MANA
haXRGGCMkcg_24 0 ONCE AGAIN IF YOU DO NOT HAVE MANA BY THIS POINT YOU CAN MULLIGAN AS MANY TIMES UNTIL YOU GET MANA

gropJQ374ZM_1 0 HI MY NAME IS TIM AMBROSUIS
gropJQ374ZM_2 0 I AM A PROFESSIONAL GUITAR TECHNICIAN FOR EXPERTVILLAGE.COM AND I AM GOING TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THE PROPER CARE OF YOUR TUBES FOR YOU TUBE AMPLIFIER
gropJQ374ZM_3 0 FIRST YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTING THEM THAT YOU DO NOT RATTLE IT TOO MUCH ALL OF THE TUBES ARE GOING TO HAVE LITTLE FILAMENTS IN THEM AND THE MORE THAT THEY ARE RATTLED THE MORE WEAR IS GOING TO GO ON THEM
gropJQ374ZM_4 0 THE NEXT THING IS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS PROPERLY VENTILATED AFTER YOU HAVE YOUR AMPLIFIER ON FOR A LITTLE WHILE THE TUBES ARE GOING TO HEAT UP REALLY HOT
gropJQ374ZM_5 0 SO YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS ALWAYS A FREE FLOW OF AIR AND THE OTHER THING IS-IS THAT THESE TUBES WILL WEAR OUT
gropJQ374ZM_6 0 THE HOTTER THAT YOU RUN THEM WHICH MEANS THE LOUDER THAT YOU TURN UP IS GOING TO BE CAUSING THEM TO LOSE LIFE FASTER
gropJQ374ZM_7 0 SO YOU ARE GOING TO PROBABLY WANT TO CHANGE THEM IF YOU ARE PLAYING WITH IT REGULARLY ABOUT ONCE A YEAR IS WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO START TO RUN OUT OR START TO NOT SOUND AS GOOD AS THEY USED TO SOUND
gropJQ374ZM_8 0 SO IF YOU WERE USING IT EVERYDAY OR AT LEAST A COUPLE DAYS A WEEK AFTER ABOUT A YEAR YOU ARE PROBABLY GOING TO WANT TO REPLACE ALL OF YOUR TUBES
G7BPZ29QF_k_1 0 HI I AM TERI LYNNE AND I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
G7BPZ29QF_k_2 0 AND IN THIS SEGMENT WE ARE GOING TO DO A GAME CALLED THROW THE STORY
G7BPZ29QF_k_3 0 NOW THIS IS A GREAT GAME TO PLAY AFTER YOU'VE OPENED ALL YOUR GIFTS ON CHRISTMAS DAY YOU'VE HAD A BIG MEAL AND YOU PRETTY FULL AND YOU DON'T WANT TO DO ANY RUNNING AROUND AND MAYBE YOU WANT THE KIDS TO CALM DOWN A BIT SO YOU CAN GET THE WHOLE FAMILY AROUND IN A CIRCLE AND DO A NICE CALM GAME
G7BPZ29QF_k_4 0 IT BRINGS BACK FOCUS AND ATTENTION TO A GROUP
G7BPZ29QF_k_5 0 IT IS A GREAT IMPROVISATION GAME YOU ARE MAKING STUFF UP ON THE SPOT
G7BPZ29QF_k_6 0 YOU NEED A MINIMUM OF TWO PEOPLE FOR THIS GAME BUT THERE IS NO MAXIMUM YOU CAN PLAY THIS WITH A LARGE GROUP OR A BIG FAMILY IF YOU HAVE ONE
G7BPZ29QF_k_7 0 DAVID IS GOING TO PLAY THIS GAME WITH ME
G7BPZ29QF_k_8 0 WE ARE GOING TO DO A 2-PERSON VERSION
G7BPZ29QF_k_9 0 BUT ALL THAT REALLY HAPPENS IS WHEN A PERSON STARTS TELLING A STORY AND ANYTIME THAT THEY FEEL THEY WANT TO STOP THEY ARE JUST GOING TO POINT AT SOMEONE ELSE IN THE GROUP AND THEY ARE GOING TO PICKUP WHERE THE OTHER PERSON LEFT OFF
G7BPZ29QF_k_10 0 YOU CAN SAY AS MUCH OR LITTLE AS YOU WANT TO ADD TO THE STORY
G7BPZ29QF_k_11 0 AND IF YOU REALLY CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING YOU ARE ALLOWED TO SAY PASS AND THEN THEY JUST GO TO SOMEONE ELSE IN THE CIRCLE
G7BPZ29QF_k_12 0 ARE YOU READY
G7BPZ29QF_k_13 0 ONCE A LITTLE BABY FISH AND HIS PAPA WERE SWIMMING ALONG THE REEF WHEN A CURRENT CAME BY AND THE LITTLE BABY FISH GOT SWEPT AWAY SEPARATED FROM PAPA FISH
G7BPZ29QF_k_14 0 AND THE LITTLE BABY FISH WAS SWIMMING AND SWIMMING AS HARD AS HE COULD TO TRY TO GET BACK TO PAPA BUT HE JUST KEPT GETTING FURTHER AND FURTHER AND FURTHER
G7BPZ29QF_k_15 0 SOON IT WOUND UP AT A VERY DANGEROUS PART OF THE REEF CALLED SHARKS ALLEY
G7BPZ29QF_k_16 0 AND THERE ALL KINDS OF VERY DANGEROUS FISH LIKE THE GREAT WHITE SHARK WAS SWIMMING AROUND
G7BPZ29QF_k_17 0 AND ALL OF A SUDDEN ONE OF THOSE GREAT WHITE SHARKS THAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT CAME AROUND THE SIDE OF A SHIPWRECK AND SPOTTED THE LITTLE BABY FISH AND IT WAS VERY HUNGRY
G7BPZ29QF_k_18 0 AND JUST AS IT WAS ABOUT THE CLAMP ITS MASSIVE JAWS AROUND THE HAPLESS FISH THEN IT GOT A TOOTHACHE
G7BPZ29QF_k_19 0 AND SO IT COULDN'T BITE OR CHEW AND IT JUST SCREAMED OUT IN PAIN BUT THE LITTLE FISH SAID OH I TOOK DENTISTRY SCHOOL I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU BIG FISH BIG SHARK
G7BPZ29QF_k_20 0 SO HE PULLED OUT OF HIS BACK POCKET A LITTLE GAUZE AND WRAPPED IT AROUND THE BIG SHARK'S HEAD AND THE TWO WENT OFF IN THE SUNSET AS FRIENDS FOREVERMORE
G7BPZ29QF_k_22 0 AND THAT'S HOW YOU PLAY THROW THE STORY
HJm6Y22QHBs_2 0 MY NAME'S ELIZABETH AND I AM SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS HOW TO FEED YOUR SUGAR GLIDER
HJm6Y22QHBs_3 0 AS I'VE SAID IN OTHER CLIPS YOU WANT TO KIND OF KEEP THE RATIO TO FIFTY TO SEVENTY PERCENT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND ALSO YOU WANT TO HAVE A PROTEIN SOURCE WHICH EITHER INSECTS SOME SORT OF GLIDER PELLET OR COMMERCIAL DOG OR CAT FOOD OR YOU CAN ALSO USE I PERSONALLY USE A ZOO LION FOOD IT'S USED BY THE CHICAGO ZOO IT'S CALLED ZOOPREEN FELINE DIET
HJm6Y22QHBs_4 0 AND I'LL SHOW YOU EACH NIGHT THEY GET A PREPARED MIX SO THEY'LL GET SOME MEALWORMS AND SOMETIMES THEY'LL GET CRICKETS
HJm6Y22QHBs_5 0 TONIGHT THE MEALWORMS ARE ON THE MENU
HJm6Y22QHBs_6 0 THEY WILL ALSO GET ABOUT AN ICE CUBE THIS WOULD BE FOR TWO SUGAR GLIDERS AN ICE CUBES WORTH OF A PRE-CHOPPED UP FRUIT AND VEGETABLE MIXTURE FROM FRESH PRODUCE
HJm6Y22QHBs_7 0 AND THEN I WILL GIVE THIS TO THEM ABOUT TWO OR THREE HOURS BEFORE THEY WILL WAKE UP AND LET IT DEFROST IN THE DISH
HJm6Y22QHBs_8 0 THEY WILL ALSO GET SOMETHING THAT I JUST CALL A GLIDER NECTAR AND WHAT IS IN HERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF OATMEAL A TOUCH OF HONEY
HJm6Y22QHBs_9 0 IT'S GOT ACACIA GUM WHICH IS A NATURAL FOOD FROM THESE GUYS THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF YOGURT IN IT AND A FEW OTHER SUPPLEMENTS
HJm6Y22QHBs_10 0 YOU CAN LOOK UP THESE RECIPES ONLINE FOR A GLIDER NECTAR OR A BML MIXTURE SO THEY GET THIS AS WELL
HJm6Y22QHBs_11 0 AND THEN LASTLY THEY GET A BLOCK OF PROTEIN AND THIS IS THAT ZOOPREEN FELINE DIET THAT I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT
HJm6Y22QHBs_12 0 BUT YOUR OTHER SOURCES AGAIN COULD BE A PELLETED DIET OF SOME SORT FOR THESE GUYS OR MONKEY BISCUITS
HJm6Y22QHBs_13 0 I JUST LIKE THIS FOOD BECAUSE IT HAPPENS TO BE VERY HIGH IN CALCIUM
HJm6Y22QHBs_14 0 THE THINGS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO ADD TO THIS DIET ARE I DON'T LIKE SEPARATING THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES FOR THESE ANIMALS BECAUSE THEY WILL JUST PICK OUT LIKE A LITTLE KID THEIR FAVORITE FOODS
HJm6Y22QHBs_15 0 IF YOU PUT ALL OF THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES TOGETHER IN ONE BIG MASHED BLOCK LIKE THIS THEY WILL EAT BOTH THEIR GREENS AND THEIR BERRIES TOGETHER AND THEY WON'T PICK AND CHOOSE WHAT'S HEALTHY AND WHAT'S NOT
HJm6Y22QHBs_16 0 THAT'S FOR YOU TO DECIDE NOT FOR THEM

GY4xUx9YR60_3 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ONE OF OUR HANDLES

GY4xUx9YR60_19 0 WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT NEXT
gJBKLgcmnbo_1 0 ALRIGHT THE NEXT THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE GOLF SHAFT
gJBKLgcmnbo_2 0 WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT HERE IS YOUR BASIC GRAPH-EYE SHAFT
gJBKLgcmnbo_3 0 YOU WILL FIND A LOT OF THESE IN YOUR WOODS HYBRIDS IS HOW WE WOULD DESCRIBE THIS
gJBKLgcmnbo_4 0 HERE IS YOUR STEEL SHAFT
gJBKLgcmnbo_5 0 YOUR MOST STANDARD IRON WILL HAVE A STEEL SHAFT
gJBKLgcmnbo_6 0 THE ONLY TIME I WOULD RECOMMEND PUTTING A GRAPH-EYE SHAFT IN YOUR IRON WOULD BE FOR YOUR HIGH HANDICAP PLAYERS OR YOUR JUNIOR PLAYERS
gJBKLgcmnbo_7 0 THE WOMEN AND THE SENIORS
gJBKLgcmnbo_8 0 THIS BEING YOU WANT TO MAKE THE CLUB AS LIGHT AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM
gJBKLgcmnbo_9 0 SO YOU WANT TO CREATE AS MUCH CLUB HEAD SPEED FOR THOSE HIGH HANDICAP PLAYERS WHO HAVE TROUBLE GETTING THE BALL UP IN THE AIR
gJBKLgcmnbo_10 0 YOU SHOULD KNOW THE FASTER THE CLUBBING SPEED THE EASIER IT IS TO GET THAT BALL UP IN THE AIR
gJBKLgcmnbo_11 0 AND BASICALLY THE REASON BEHIND THAT IS YOU ARE PUTTING SPIN ON THE GOLF BALL
gJBKLgcmnbo_12 0 SO THE STEEL SHAFT AND THE IRONS THEY COME IN DIFFERENT STIFFNESS
gJBKLgcmnbo_13 0 YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE RIGHT HERE THIS IS CALLED A PROJECT X RIFLE SHAFT
gJBKLgcmnbo_14 0 IT'S A 6.5 AND BASICALLY THAT'S EXTRA STIFF
gJBKLgcmnbo_15 0 THESE GO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO 5.0 5.5 AND SIX
gJBKLgcmnbo_16 0 AND BASICALLY THAT'S JUST THE DIFFERENCE IN THE STIFFNESS IN THE SHAFT
gJBKLgcmnbo_17 0 YOUR AVERAGE GOLFER IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE MORE LIKE A 5.0 AND THIS IS JUST MEASUREMENTS IN THE RIFLE SHAFT SERIES
gJBKLgcmnbo_18 0 LIKE WE MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE GRAPH-EYE SHAFT THEY HAVE THE WEIGHT OF THE SHAFT RIGHT HERE
gJBKLgcmnbo_19 0 THAT'S AN 85 GRAM SHAFT EXTRA STIFF
gJBKLgcmnbo_20 0 SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES
gJBKLgcmnbo_21 0 NOW WITH A GRAPH-EYE SHAFT THE LIGHTER THE SHAFT IT'S PROBABLY FOR THE SLOWER SPEED
gJBKLgcmnbo_22 0 THIS IS JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO CREATE A FASTER SPIN SPEED
gJBKLgcmnbo_23 0 PUT LIGHT SHAFT IN YOUR HAND AND YOU WILL CREATE THAT FASTER SPIN SPEED
gJBKLgcmnbo_24 0 THE BIGGER AND STRONGER PLAYERS YOU WANT A HEAVIER SHAFT IN YOUR GOLF CLUB
gJBKLgcmnbo_25 0 AND THOSE ARE JUST BASIC IDEAS AND THINGS YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IN THE GOLF SHAFT
gJBKLgcmnbo_26 0 THE MAIN THING WITH THE SHAFT LIKE I SAID IS GOING TO BE THE STIFFNESS IN THE WEIGHT
gJBKLgcmnbo_27 0 THE HEAVIER THE GOLF SHAFT THE STIFFER THE SHAFT IS GOING TO BE
gJBKLgcmnbo_28 0 AND THAT'S KIND OF ONE THING YOU WANT TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR
gJBKLgcmnbo_29 0 THE NEXT THING WE ARE GOING TO GO INTO IS THE LENGTH OF THE CLUB
gJBKLgcmnbo_30 0 ANYWHERE FROM YOUR WEDGES TO YOUR DRIVERS AND WHICH LENGTH IS RIGHT FOR YOU
HIGLdGs52XQ_1 0 HELLO WELCOME BACK
HIGLdGs52XQ_2 0 THE NEXT THING WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS AMBULATORY VS NON-AMBULATORY CARE OF THE ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS OR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ILL
HIGLdGs52XQ_3 0 MANY CLIENTS ARE EITHER BED RIDDEN OR IN A WHEELCHAIR AND THEY CAN'T GET TO MASSAGE TABLES SUCH AS THIS
HIGLdGs52XQ_4 0 SO FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH THEM WHERE THEY'RE AT
HIGLdGs52XQ_5 0 IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS IN A WHEELCHAIR WE'LL MASSAGE THEIR ARMS MASSAGE THEIR LEGS MASSAGE THEIR NECKS WHILE THEY'RE IN THE CHAIR
HIGLdGs52XQ_6 0 FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE BED RIDDEN AND OFTEN TIMES THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN'T EASILY GET UP FOR WHATEVER REASON
HIGLdGs52XQ_7 0 WHETHER IT'S THEIR BED IN THEIR HOUSE OR A HOSPITAL BED WE'LL WORK WITH THEM IN THE BED
HIGLdGs52XQ_8 0 SO YOU MIGHT HAVE TO SIT NEXT TO THEM ON THEIR BED YOU MIGHT HAVE TO KNEEL NEXT TO THEM YOU MIGHT BE ON THE FLOOR NEXT TO THE INDIVIDUAL WORKING ON THEM AND JUST KNOW THAT FOR WHATEVER AMOUNT OF TIME YOU HAVE TO BE CONSCIENTIOUS OF YOUR OWN BODY
HIGLdGs52XQ_9 0 SO YOU DON'T WANT TO INJURE YOUR KNEES OR YOUR BACK BENDING OVER TRYING TO ASSIST THIS INDIVIDUAL
HIGLdGs52XQ_10 0 NOW WITH THE AMBULATORY OR NON-AMBULATORY CARE IT CAN BE AS SHORT AS TEN MINUTES IT CAN BE AS LONG AS AN HOUR
HIGLdGs52XQ_11 0 GENERALLY THEY'RE ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY MINUTES TO 45 MINUTES LONG SESSIONS
HIGLdGs52XQ_12 0 ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT AND IT TENDS TO BE OVER STIMULATION FOR THE INDIVIDUAL
HIGLdGs52XQ_13 0 WITH AMBULATORY CARE THE INDIVIDUAL IS ABLE TO WALK UP TO A MASSAGE TABLE SUCH AS THIS AND LAY THEMSELVES ON THE TABLE
HIGLdGs52XQ_14 0 NOW FOR ME I HAD TO ACTUALLY LOWER THE TABLE I TEND TO WORK WITH A HIGHER TABLE SINCE I'M TALL
HIGLdGs52XQ_15 0 YOU'RE BETTER LOWERING THE TABLE SO YOUR CLIENTS CAN SAFELY GET ONTO THE TABLE WITHOUT HAVING TO USE A STOOL AND POSSIBLY INJURING THEMSELVES
G-D1VVcSptE_1 0 NOW THAT YOU ARE UP ON YOUR UNICYCLE WE HAVE DONE ALL OUR ROCKS WE HAVE GOTTEN PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH IT ALL
G-D1VVcSptE_2 0 I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU WEIGHT DISPLACEMENT
G-D1VVcSptE_3 0 IF YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THIS THE WAY I HAVE BEEN TELLING YOU YOU PROBABLY ARE ALREADY GETTING FAMILIAR WITH WHERE YOUR WEIGHT IS SUPPOSE TO GO
G-D1VVcSptE_4 0 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GET IT JUST RIGHT BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO FIND THAT SWEET SPOT
G-D1VVcSptE_5 0 THE SWEET SPOT IS WHERE YOU FIND THAT EXACT SPOT WHERE YOU ARE BALANCING YOU ARE NOT LEANING TO FAR FORWARD OR TO FAR BACK OR FROM SIDE TO SIDE
G-D1VVcSptE_6 0 FOR WEIGHT DISPLACEMENT YOU SHOULD LEAN BACK JUST A LITTLE BIT
G-D1VVcSptE_7 0 TWO REASONS ONE YOU CAN BALANCE YOUR WEIGHT IF YOUR CHEST IS OVER YOUR FEET
G-D1VVcSptE_8 0 THIS DIFFERS IN PEOPLE BUT FOR THE MOST PART EVERYONE AGREES
G-D1VVcSptE_9 0 TWO IF YOU ARE LEANING BACK AND YOU FALL YOU WANT TO FALL BACKWARDS
Hc8Y6Y_EMjk_1 0 HI I AM DOCTOR TERRANELLA AND WE WANT TO DEMONSTRATE SOME OF THE CHANGES IN BLOOD PRESSURE THAT OCCUR WITH ACTIVITY
Hc8Y6Y_EMjk_2 0 SO WE TOOK BOB'S BLOOD PRESSURE EARLIER IT WAS AROUND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY OVER EIGHTY AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO HAVE HIM EXERCISE AND TAKE HIS BLOOD PRESSURE AGAIN AND SEE HOW THOSE CHANGES OCCUR
Hc8Y6Y_EMjk_3 0 THEN IN THE NEXT SEGMENT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT OF THE PHYSIOLOGY BEHIND HOW THAT BLOOD PRESSURE IS CHANGING
Hc8Y6Y_EMjk_4 0 SO WE JUST TOOK BOB TO HIS TARGET HEART RATE AND WE SAW THAT HE DID SOME EXERCISE AND NOW WE WANT TO DEMONSTRATE SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN HIS BLOOD PRESSURE NOW THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT
Hc8Y6Y_EMjk_6 0 GOOD JUST RELAX THAT ARM
Hc8Y6Y_EMjk_7 0 OKAY SO HIS BLOOD PRESSURE THERE WAS NOW ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY OVER EIGHTY
Hc8Y6Y_EMjk_8 0 SO WE CAN SEE THAT IT IS A LITTLE BIT ELEVATED WITH THE ACTIVITY THAT WE JUST DID AND NOW WE WANT TO DEMONSTRATE USING SOME COMMON HOUSE HOLD ITEMS
Hc8Y6Y_EMjk_9 0 HOW THOSE AFFECTS ARE ACTUALLY TAKING PLACE IN THE BODY
gsz6IiyQkD0_1 0 SO WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO START TO GO INTO THE DARKROOM AND ACTUALLY MAKE OUR CONTACT SHEETS
gsz6IiyQkD0_2 0 THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS JUST A LITTLE BIT OF PREPARATION
gsz6IiyQkD0_3 0 A VERY IMPORTANT ITEM THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED IS GLASS AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO START OUT WITH A NICE CLEAN PIECE OF GLASS
gsz6IiyQkD0_4 0 THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN PRINTING WITH A CONTACT PRINTER OR PIECE OF GLASS THAT HAS SCRATCHES AND DIRT ALL OVER IT
gsz6IiyQkD0_5 0 SO I LIKE TO USUALLY JUST TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF GLASS CLEANER
gsz6IiyQkD0_6 0 AND AGAIN PREPARATION FOR THIS TYPE OF STUFF GOES A LONG WAY
gsz6IiyQkD0_7 0 THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN STARTING IN THE DARKROOM AND REALIZING YOU DON'T HAVE WHAT YOU NEED TO MAKE SOME WORK
gsz6IiyQkD0_8 0 SO I JUST LOOK YOU KNOW YOU JUST WANT TO BASICALLY MAKE IT NICE AND CLEAN
gsz6IiyQkD0_9 0 NO DUST ON IT
gsz6IiyQkD0_11 0 SO THESE ARE MY NEGATIVES THAT WE DEVELOPED AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY MAKE A PRINT A CONTACT SHEET FROM THEM WHICH IS GOING TO LOOK SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THIS
gsz6IiyQkD0_12 0 THEN WE'RE GOING TO READ OFF THE CONTACT SHEET AND DECIDE WHAT IMAGE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A PRINT FROM
H0xSLFBsrCA_1 0 OKAY IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE COVERING REMOVING THE DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT AND REAR INNER DOOR INSERTS
H0xSLFBsrCA_2 0 AND HERE'S WHERE THINGS GET A LITTLE BIT TRICKY AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE WE PAY ATTENTION TO DETAIL AT THIS POINT
H0xSLFBsrCA_3 0 AS WE TAKE THE PARTS OFF WE WANT TO LAY THEM OUT SO THEY STAY IN THE SAME FORMAT BECAUSE THERE'S A CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER THEY OVERLAP OTHER PLASTIC PARTS AND IF WE KEEP THEM IN THAT ORDER THE REASSEMBLY PHASE WILL BE A LOT LESS CONFUSING A LOT LESS CHANCE WE END UP WITH SOME OVERLAPPING LABOR I.E
H0xSLFBsrCA_4 0 WE PUT SOMETHING ON OUT OF ORDER AND WE HAVE TO REMOVE IT BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE WENT ON UNDERNEATH IT
H0xSLFBsrCA_5 0 SO FIRST THING YOU DO IS REMOVE THE THREE SCREWS THAT HOLD DOWN THE INSERT
H0xSLFBsrCA_6 0 IF YOU'LL LOOK AT THE INSERT ON BOTH ENDS YOU'LL SEE HOW IT OVERLAPS THE TWO PLASTIC PARTS ON EITHER SIDE
H0xSLFBsrCA_7 0 SO THAT'S THE FIRST STEP THAT HAS TO BE DONE BEFORE THESE OTHER PLASTIC PARTS CAN BE REMOVED
H0xSLFBsrCA_8 0 AND SCREWS WILL GO RIGHT INTO THE LITTLE PLASTIC INSERT THERE
H0xSLFBsrCA_9 0 JUST WANT TO REMOVE ALL THREE SCREWS
H0xSLFBsrCA_10 0 THIS OVER HERE ISN'T FREELY BACKING OUT SO IT'S BEEN STRIPPED
H0xSLFBsrCA_11 0 SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS BY LIFTING UP ON IT AS I DRILL I GET SOME LIFTING MOTION AND IT HELPS PULL THAT SCREW OUT OF THE STRIPPED INSERT
H0xSLFBsrCA_12 0 NOW IF I MARK OR NOTE THAT I CAN GO BACK AND PUT A LARGER SCREW IN OR REPLACE THE WORN OUT INSERT THAT'S IN THE BODY
H0xSLFBsrCA_13 0 AND I JUST SNAP THE PIECE OUT WANT TO KEEP THE SCREWS TOGETHER
H0xSLFBsrCA_14 0 LAY THAT ASIDE AND WE'LL JUST MOVE TO THE FRONT DOOR AND GET THAT ACCESS PANEL NEXT OR THE INSERT NEXT
H0xSLFBsrCA_15 0 NOW IN THE FRONT WE HAVE THE EXACT SAME SITUATION THREE SCREWS THAT HOLD IT DOWN IT'S A LITTLE BIT LARGER AND YOU CAN SEE HOW IT OVERLAPS THE PIECE IN FRONT OF IT THE KICK PANEL AND IT OVERLAPS THE BACK PIECE WHERE THE BEING THE DOOR PILLAR
H0xSLFBsrCA_16 0 WE'LL REMOVE THOSE SCREWS
H0xSLFBsrCA_17 0 NOW THESE TEND TO ACCUMULATE A LOT OF DUST AND DIRT AND YOU MIGHT GET DIRT BUILT UP IN THE SCREWS WHERE YOU CAN'T INSERT THE PHILLIPS
H0xSLFBsrCA_18 0 WITH A PICK OR SOME COMPRESSED AIR OR THAT LITTLE FINE SCREWDRIVER CAN CLEAN THOSE GROOVES OUT AND MAKE IT EASIER TO GET A GRIP ON THE SCREWS IF YOU NEED TO
H0xSLFBsrCA_19 0 NOW WE HAVE THAT REMOVED WE'LL JUST GO AHEAD AND PLOP THAT OFF AND WE'LL SET THESE ASIDE BUT WE'RE GOING TO AS WE TAKE OFF THE OTHER PIECES WE'LL LAY THEM BACK IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER JUST AS WE TOOK THEM OFF THE VEHICLE SO IT'LL MAKE REASSEMBLY THAT MUCH EASIER
H0xSLFBsrCA_20 0 SO WATCH OUR NEXT SEGMENT WE'LL COVER ACTUALLY REMOVING THE PIECES AND WE'LL JUST LAY THEM OUT IN THE SAME ORDER WE TOOK THEM OFF SO WE GET EVERYTHING IN GOOD CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER
H58qnPui2hI_1 0 NOW SOMETHING ELSE YOU WANT TO BE AWARE OF IN ALL KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS BUT ESPECIALLY ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS MARRIAGES WHEN IT COMES TO PERCEPTION CHECKING DON'T BE A MIND READER
H58qnPui2hI_2 0 THAT'S WHAT WE TEND TO DO
H58qnPui2hI_3 0 WE TEND TO TRY TO READ THE OTHER PERSON'S MIND AND PERCEIVE WHAT THEY'RE FEELING WHAT THEY'RE THINKING WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE RELATIONSHIP AND YOU WANT TO AVOID THAT
H58qnPui2hI_4 0 LET'S SAY MY HUSBAND AND I ARE WATCHING TELEVISION AND I'M TRYING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH HIM AND HE'S NOT REALLY SAYING ANYTHING TO ME
H58qnPui2hI_5 0 SO I PERCEIVE THAT HE'S MAD AT ME
H58qnPui2hI_6 0 WELL I CAN GO WITH THAT PERCEPTION THAT HE'S MAD SO THEN I'LL JUST BE MAD
H58qnPui2hI_7 0 A COUNTER ACTION FOLLOWS
H58qnPui2hI_8 0 OR I CAN NOT MIND READ
H58qnPui2hI_9 0 I CAN DIRECTLY SAY ARE YOU MAD AT ME
H58qnPui2hI_10 0 OR I MIGHT BE MORE INDIRECT WOULD YOU RATHER WATCH TV RIGHT NOW
H58qnPui2hI_11 0 OR I MIGHT SAY ARE YOU MAD AT ME OR ARE YOU MAD AT THE KIDS
H58qnPui2hI_12 0 SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS NOT GO AND RUN OFF ON A TANGENT WITH THAT INITIAL PERCEPTION WITHOUT ASKING THE OTHER PERSON POINT BLANK IF THAT PERCEPTION IS TRUE
gUqgX-M-MDE_1 0 HI MY NAME IS DON SNYDER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL SKEET SHOOTING ASSOCIATION ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
gUqgX-M-MDE_2 0 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT NOW IS MOUNTING A SHOTGUN GETTING THE SHOTGUN IN THE POSITION WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE END OF THE GUN AND ALSO SEE THE TARGET
gUqgX-M-MDE_3 0 THAT'S THE PRIMARY THING WE WANT TO LOOK AT IS THE TARGET AND YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO SEE ABOVE THE SHOTGUN TO DO THAT
gUqgX-M-MDE_4 0 NOW IN ORDER TO MOUNT THE SHOTGUN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO BRING THE SHOTGUN TO YOUR FACE THE STOCK
gUqgX-M-MDE_5 0 AND THIS IS THE STOCK IN THE COMB OF THE SHOTGUN AND KIND OF WHAT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IS BRING THAT TO YOUR SHOULDER AND FACE SIMULTANEOUSLY
gUqgX-M-MDE_6 0 BRING THE SHOTGUN THE STOCK THE COMB TO THE FACE SIMULTANEOUSLY
gUqgX-M-MDE_7 0 WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS YOU DON'T WANT TO BRING THE SHOTGUN HERE AND THEN BRING YOUR HEAD DOWN LIKE SO
gUqgX-M-MDE_8 0 YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR HEAD AND EYES PERFECTLY ERECT AND BRING THE SHOTGUN TO THE FACE
gUqgX-M-MDE_9 0 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE FOUND THAT HAS BEEN VERY VERY HELPFUL PARTICULARLY FOR BEGINNING SHOOTERS IS IF THEY'LL BRING THE SHOTGUN TO THEIR SHOULDER BRING IT TO THE SHOULDER WHERE IT'S COMFORTABLE AND THEN ACTUALLY MOVE THE SHOTGUN OVER TO THE FACE AND THEN YOU CAN CHECK DOWN THE BARREL TO MAKE SURE THAT THE EYES ARE ALIGNED PROPERLY OVER THE SHOTGUN
gUqgX-M-MDE_10 0 AGAIN IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO GET YOUR EYES IN LINE WITH THE SHOTGUN OVER ABOVE SO YOU CAN LOOK AT THE TARGET
Ge6HAp6N1-w_1 0 I'VE PINNED THIS CUFF ALL THE WAY AROUND THE EDGE TO KNOW THAT'S WHERE WANT I WANT TO MAKE THE BOTTOM HEM
Ge6HAp6N1-w_2 0 SO I ALREADY TURNED THIS UNDER A QUARTER OF AN INCH TO BIND THE SEAM AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NOW IS RUN A SEAM ALL THE WAY AROUND JUST RIGHT ON TOP OF IT TO CLOSE IT
Ge6HAp6N1-w_3 0 AND THE IDEA IS WHEN I DO THAT WHEN I TURN THIS OVER THIS CUFF OVER THAT HEM IS SAFELY TUCKED AWAY AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE THAT
Ge6HAp6N1-w_4 0 AND ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS JUST PUT YOUR FABRIC UNDER THERE AND THIS IS A GOOD TIME ALSO AGAIN TO MAKE SURE YOUR SEAMS ALL LINE UP
Ge6HAp6N1-w_5 0 JUST PUT IT RIGHT ON TOP OF WHERE YOU SEWED BEFORE BACKSTITCH OF COURSE
Ge6HAp6N1-w_6 0 YOU DON'T WANT THAT COMING APART AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME WIDTH THAT I HEMMED IT UNDER AS THE PANT LEGS
Ge6HAp6N1-w_7 0 I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT NOT FITTING
Ge6HAp6N1-w_8 0 SO LET'S GO ALL THE WAY AROUND
Ge6HAp6N1-w_9 0 SO HERE WE ARE AT ANOTHER SEAM
Ge6HAp6N1-w_10 0 AND YOU CAN LOOK AT IT AGAIN TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS SEAM MATCHES THIS SEAM AND LINES RIGHT UP
Ge6HAp6N1-w_11 0 DO A BACK TACK OF COURSE
Ge6HAp6N1-w_12 0 AND IF THOSE PINS RUN AWAY YOU CAN JUST TAKE THEM OUT

Ge6HAp6N1-w_15 0 I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND RUN A SEAM ALONG THE OTHER LEG
Ge6HAp6N1-w_16 0 THAT WILL BE REALLY SIMPLE
Ge6HAp6N1-w_17 0 AND IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHICH SEAM YOU START ON BECAUSE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE THIS WHEN THESE PANTS ARE FINISHED ANYWAYS
Ge6HAp6N1-w_18 0 SO YOU JUST LINE IT UP NICE AND STRAIGHT
Ge6HAp6N1-w_19 0 DO A LITTLE BACK TACK
Ge6HAp6N1-w_20 0 I CAN GO A LITTLE BIT FASTER ON THIS ONE BECAUSE I KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO DO IT
Ge6HAp6N1-w_21 0 LET'S GO ALL THE WAY AROUND
Ge6HAp6N1-w_22 0 THERE WE GO
Ge6HAp6N1-w_23 0 AND ANOTHER BACK TACK AND MAKE SURE THAT THE SEAMS MATCH UP AT THE AT THE SIDE SEAMS AGAIN
Ge6HAp6N1-w_24 0 I'M ALMOST FINISHED WITH THIS
Ge6HAp6N1-w_25 0 FEEL FREE TO TAKE THESE PINS OUT TOO IF THEY'RE IN THE WAY
Ge6HAp6N1-w_26 0 CAUSE SOME OF THESE ARE IN THE WAY SOME AREN'T
Ge6HAp6N1-w_27 0 I'LL JUST LIKE I'LL TAKE IT OUT IF IT IS
Ge6HAp6N1-w_28 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO RUN OVER A PIN AND BREAK OUR NEEDLE

gPn8obkZyPI_1 0 HI THIS IS MELODY AGAIN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE WE ARE FINISHING UP A DESIGN THAT WE STARTED UP A FEW MINUTES AGO
gPn8obkZyPI_2 0 THIS IS OUR STRING ART PROJECT THERE ARE SOME MANY CHOOSES YOU CAN DO ANYTHING THAT YOU LIKE I'M JUST DOING A VERY SIMPLE PATTERN WHERE I'M GOING ONE STEP UP AT A TIME AND THEN ONE STEP UP AT A TIME
gPn8obkZyPI_3 0 JUST A VERY VERY SIMPLE PATTERN
gPn8obkZyPI_4 0 ALRIGHT THERE IS WHERE I THINK I WANT MY TO FINISH AND NORMALLY WHAT I WOULD DO IS TIE THESE OFF AT THE END HERE AND THAT WOULD BE FINISH
gPn8obkZyPI_5 0 I WOULD TIE THIS OFF BREAK THIS OFF BUT I THINK WHAT I MIGHT DO IS KEEP IT SO I CAN TAKE IT APART
gPn8obkZyPI_6 0 IN OUR NEXT SEGMENT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MIX TWO DIFFERENT COLORS OF STRING ON THE SAME DESIGN AND SHOW YOU WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE
G-MWr1mTTuo_1 0 NEXT TRICK WE ARE GOING TO DO TODAY IS ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVORITES
G-MWr1mTTuo_2 0 I KNOW I GOT A LOT OF FAVORITES BUT THIS ONES COOL
G-MWr1mTTuo_3 0 IT'S CALLED THE IRON WHIP
G-MWr1mTTuo_4 0 YOU'RE ACTUALLY TAKING YOUR STRING WITH YOUR HAND AND WHIPPING THE OTHER ONE IT MIDAIR
G-MWr1mTTuo_5 0 IT LOOKS LIKE THIS
G-MWr1mTTuo_6 0 IT'S A COOL TRICK
G-MWr1mTTuo_7 0 YOU WHIP THE STRING AROUND THERE LIKE SO
G-MWr1mTTuo_8 0 YOU CAN DO IT FAST
G-MWr1mTTuo_9 0 IF YOU DO IT A LITTLE FASTER SOMETIMES IT'S A LITTLE HARDER TO CATCH
G-MWr1mTTuo_10 0 YOU CAN ALSO PINCH THE STRING AND DO IT A LITTLE BIT SLOWER
G-MWr1mTTuo_11 0 SEE IT A LITTLE BIT SLOWER IN MOTION
G-MWr1mTTuo_12 0 I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU THE GENERAL MOVES FIRST AND THEN YOU CAN DECIDE HOW YOU WANT TO DO IT
G-MWr1mTTuo_13 0 TO DO THE IRON WHIP YOU START WITH A TRAPEZE LIKE SO
G-MWr1mTTuo_14 0 YOU TAKE YOUR THROW HAND BRING IT INTO THE STRING JUST LIKE SO
G-MWr1mTTuo_15 0 I'LL SHOW YOU FROM HERE AGAIN
G-MWr1mTTuo_16 0 MAKE THAT LOOP OPEN YOU TAKE YOUR THROW HAND AND YOU GRAB THE STRING LIKE SO
G-MWr1mTTuo_17 0 YOU RE ACTUALLY GOING TO POP THE YO-YO OUT OF THE STRING ON THE INSIDE IT'S THE SIDE CLOSEST TO YOUR BODY
G-MWr1mTTuo_18 0 POPS UP LIKE SO AND NOW YOU'VE GOT THIS LOOP OF STRING THAT YOU GRABBED
G-MWr1mTTuo_19 0 THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT YOU USE TO WHIP THE YO-YO ONTO THE STRING
G-MWr1mTTuo_20 0 SO LET ME SHOW YOU AGAIN
G-MWr1mTTuo_21 0 IT LOOKS LIKE THIS YOU GRAB THE STRING YOU POP IT UP AND THEN IN ONE MOTION YOU'RE GOING TO WHIP AROUND THE YO-YO IN MIDAIR
G-MWr1mTTuo_22 0 THIS TAKES A LOT OF PRACTICE
G-MWr1mTTuo_23 0 ONE THING THAT'S GOOD TO PRACTICE IS GRAB IT WITH YOUR HAND AND JUST PRACTICE WHIPPING
G-MWr1mTTuo_24 0 YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BE WHIPPING THE YO-YO
G-MWr1mTTuo_25 0 JUST PRACTICE GETTING THAT LOOP BIG PRACTICE WHIPPING AND THEN ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO POP THE YO-YO UP AND WHIP IT ONTO THE STRING
G-MWr1mTTuo_26 0 ANOTHER THING TO PRACTICE WHEN YOU WHIP YOU WANT YOU HAND TO LOOK LIKE THIS
G-MWr1mTTuo_27 0 YOU WANT THE STRING AROUND YOUR POINTER FINGER AND YOU PINKIE LIKE SO
G-MWr1mTTuo_28 0 YOU AIM WITH YOUR THUMB AND POINTER FINGER
G-MWr1mTTuo_29 0 WHEN YOU WHIP IT IF YOU AIM TOWARDS THE CENTER OF THE GAP YOU ARE MOST LIKELY GOING TO HIT THE YO-YO
G-MWr1mTTuo_30 0 SO LIKE THIS
G-MWr1mTTuo_31 0 CAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THE LOOP WILL COME DOWN
G-MWr1mTTuo_32 0 THE LOOP COMES DOWN AND IF YOUR AIMING WITH YOUR POINTER AND THUMB IT'S GOING TO SHOOT ACROSS AND HIT THE YO-YO LIKE SO
G-MWr1mTTuo_33 0 SO LET ME SHOW YOU ONE MORE TIME IN REAL SPEED
G-MWr1mTTuo_34 0 LOOKS LIKE THAT JUST LIKE THAT
G-MWr1mTTuo_35 0 THAT'S IRON WHIP
G-MWr1mTTuo_36 0 IT'S A COOL TRICK WORTH PRACTICING

GqfeRfKxozI_2 0 OFTEN TIMES WHEN YOU'RE FRAMING A PICTURE AND YOU ARE GOING TO ENCOUNTER IS YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR TIME AND CHECK DIFFERENT OPTIONS
GqfeRfKxozI_3 0 THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT COLORS OF BLACK AND AS YOU PUT THEM DOWN ON IT YOU WILL LOOK AND SEE WHAT YOU LIKE BETTER THAT'S TOO SHINY
GqfeRfKxozI_4 0 THAT MATTE FINISH IS KIND OF NICE
GqfeRfKxozI_5 0 IT BRINGS OUT SOME COLOR SOME OF THE FACES SO I'M GOING TO SET IT OVER HERE THIS COLOR HERE THAT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR IT THERE'S TOO MUCH BROWN IN IT THERE IS NO BROWN IN THE PICTURE
GqfeRfKxozI_6 0 WE CAN GO BACK TO THAT GRAY THOUGHT AGAIN THAT'S TO GREEN THIS ONE WILL ACTUALLY WORK THIS ONE IS THE ONLY COLOR THAT ACTUALLY YOU CAN PUT ON THIS PICTURE
GqfeRfKxozI_7 0 BUT AS I PUT IT DOWN THERE THE PICTURE KIND OF FADES AWAY A LITTLE BIT COMPARED TO PUTTING THIS BLACK ONE ON IT IT STARTED TO BRING THE BLACKS BACK UP
GqfeRfKxozI_8 0 THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A MATTE IT JUST ENHANCED IT'S NOT TO HINDER IT
GqfeRfKxozI_9 0 IT'S TO GIVE IT A LITTLE POP TO HELP PULL OUT THE OTHER COLORS IN THERE THAT NEED TO BE
h59xVS-BEIg_1 0 HI THIS IS JON AND IN THIS CLIP I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT CLOTHING
h59xVS-BEIg_2 0 YOU ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE WEARING SOMEWHAT TIGHT FITTING CLOTHING
h59xVS-BEIg_3 0 IF YOU HAVE TOO LOOSE OF CLOTHING YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET CAUGHT IN ONE OF THE MACHINES
h59xVS-BEIg_4 0 HERE YOU'LL SEE MY SHIRT IS FAIRLY TIGHT MY JEANS FIT ME GOOD THEY'RE NOT TOO BAGGY
h59xVS-BEIg_5 0 IF SAY YOU HAD A LOOSE SLEEVE IT COULD EASILY GET CAUGHT INTO ANY ONE OF A NUMBER OF MACHINES THAT HAS A ROTATING BLADE OR OTHER ROTATING PARTS
h59xVS-BEIg_6 0 NEXT YOU'LL SEE THAT MY SHOES COMPLETELY COVER MY FEET
h59xVS-BEIg_7 0 I DO NOT HAVE SANDALS ON OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF OPEN-TOED SHOES
h59xVS-BEIg_8 0 WHEN WORKING IN YOUR SHOP YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE COVERING YOUR FEET SO THAT YOU DON'T DROP ANYTHING ON IT AND INJURE YOURSELF
h59xVS-BEIg_9 0 ADDITIONALLY YOU'LL NOTICE THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY WATCHES OR MAYBE A DANGLY NECKLACE ON
h59xVS-BEIg_10 0 IF YOU DO WEAR THOSE MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE THEM BEFORE WORKING IN YOUR WOOD SHOP
h59xVS-BEIg_11 0 NOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE STAINING OR FINISHING YOU MAY WANT TO WEAR SOME TYPE OF A SHOP COAT TO HELP PROTECT YOUR CLOTHES UNDERNEATH
h59xVS-BEIg_12 0 HOWEVER SINCE THE SHOP COAT IS A LITTLE BIT BAGGY YOU'LL WANT TO MAKE SURE AND REMOVE THAT BEFORE YOU WORK ON ANY EQUIPMENT
gbmk2SqTtDI_1 0 NATHAN MCCULLOUGH HI MY NAME IS NATE MCCULLOUGH ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gbmk2SqTtDI_2 0 IN THESE CLIPS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE TIPS AND TRICKS IN ORDER TO PROPERLY WINTERIZE YOUR VEHICLE
gbmk2SqTtDI_3 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT YOUR VEHICLE'S WIPER BLADES AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SUMMERTIME BLADE AND A WINTER BLADE
gbmk2SqTtDI_4 0 WHAT I HAVE HERE DISPLAYED ON THE HOOD IS A TYPICAL SUMMERTIME BLADE
gbmk2SqTtDI_5 0 AND WHAT I HAVE RIGHT BEHIND IT IS YOUR TYPICAL WINTERTIME BLADE
gbmk2SqTtDI_6 0 AS YOU CAN SEE THE WINTERTIME BLADE HAS A RUBBER SHEATH OVER ALL OF THE MOVING COMPONENTS INSIDE OF THE WIPER
gbmk2SqTtDI_7 0 THESE PIECES THAT THE SHEATH IS COVERING ARE EXAMPLED HERE
gbmk2SqTtDI_8 0 THESE ARE SPRINGS BUILT INSIDE OF IT TO ACTUALLY HUG THE WIPER BLADE TIGHT TO YOUR WINDSHIELD
gbmk2SqTtDI_9 0 IF YOU NOTICE ON THE WINTERTIME YOU'RE DRIVING ALONG AND TRY AND USE YOUR WIPER BLADES THEY WON'T TOUCH ALL OF THE WINDSHIELD ITSELF
gbmk2SqTtDI_10 0 IT'LL ACTUALLY LEAVE STREAKS AND PORTIONS OF IT THAT ARE UNCLEANED
gbmk2SqTtDI_11 0 WHAT THAT IS FROM IS FROM ICE DEBRIS SNOW THINGS OF THAT NATURE GETTING INSIDE OF THE SPRINGS AND KEEPING THEM FROM CONTACTING YOUR WINDSHIELD
gbmk2SqTtDI_12 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THE SPRING ACTION HERE RIGHT THERE
gbmk2SqTtDI_13 0 WHAT THE RUBBER SHEATH DOES IS KEEP THOSE FORMED PARTICLES FROM AFFECTING THE WAY THE MECHANICS OF THE WIPER BLADE HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO OPERATE
gbmk2SqTtDI_14 0 IT'S A GOOD IDEA IF YOU DO A LOT OF DRIVING IN THE WINTERTIME OR LIVING IN ONE OF THE NORTHERN STATES TO GO AHEAD AND CHANGE OUT YOUR WIPER BLADES
gbmk2SqTtDI_15 0 NOW YOUR SUMMER BLADE MIGHT NOT BE WORN OUT
gbmk2SqTtDI_16 0 IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO JUST DISCONNECT YOUR SUMMERTIME BLADE PUT IT IN THE TRUNK OR IN YOUR GARAGE SOMEWHERE AND SAVE IT FOR LATER ON WHEN THE SUMMER ROLLS AROUND
gbmk2SqTtDI_17 0 BUY A SET OF THESE BUY A SET OF THESE
gbmk2SqTtDI_18 0 THAT IS THE WAY THAT YOU'LL OPTIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE FROM YOUR WIPER BLADES AND IT'LL KEEP YOU SEEING GOOD THROUGHOUT THE WINTER

ggyQaBY9Mq8_1 0 JOHN VANDEBROOKE THIS IS JOHN VANDEBROOKE AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I AM INVITING YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR SERIES OF INTERMEDIATE STAGES OF ENCAUSTIC PAINTING
ggyQaBY9Mq8_2 0 NOW WE TALKED ABOUT RUBBER STAMPS BUT ANOTHER METHOD OF USING WAX TO COVER AN IMAGE IS WITH PHOTOGRAPHY
ggyQaBY9Mq8_3 0 A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE INTO PHOTOGRAPHY SO TO MIX WAX REALLY IS EXCITING FOR THEM
ggyQaBY9Mq8_4 0 HOW I STARTED WAS WITH A LITTLE IMAGE OF A MAN THAT WAS PERFORMING OVER IN VICTORIA ON THE STREET TOOK HIS IMAGE HOME AND BECAUSE I'M IN A GALLERY WHERE WE HAVE TO HANG NEW WORK EVERY MONTH THIS IDEA CAME TO ME ABOUT USING PHOTOGRAPHY
ggyQaBY9Mq8_5 0 SO HERE I TOOK HIS IMAGE I WENT TO A PRINT SHOP I HAD THEM PRINT IT ON A PIECE OF SHINY CARD STACK AND THEN I JUST BEGAN TO WAX ON TOP OF THE SURFACE
ggyQaBY9Mq8_6 0 I DIDN'T PUT CLEAR WAX DOWN FIRST JUST LIKE WITH RUBBER STAMPS BUT I GOT THIS IMAGE WHICH WAS THE FIRST ONE I TRIED AND IT BECAME VERY POPULAR
ggyQaBY9Mq8_7 0 AND ONCE YOU START SELLING SOMETHING YOU GO HEY THIS IS A GOOD IDEA
ggyQaBY9Mq8_8 0 I THINK I'LL DO SOME MORESO ANOTHER METHOD THAT I DID WAS TO TAKE A PICTURE OF A STATUE IN A GARDEN AND THEN I COVERED THAT WITH CLEAR WAX AND IN THIS CASE I PUT DOWN SOME TISSUE PAPER AND THEN I SHOWED THE THREADS OF THE TISSUE PAPER THROUGH THE WAX AND COLORED ON TOP OF THAT SURFACE TO CREATE THIS EFFECT AND IT HAS AN INTERESTING TRANSITION FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH TO THE WAX COATING
ggyQaBY9Mq8_9 0 HERE WAS ANOTHER STATUE IN A GARDEN THAT I TOOK AND THEN DID SOME WAX ON TOP
ggyQaBY9Mq8_10 0 YOU SEE THE PHOTOGRAPH ENDS RIGHT HERE AND THEN THE WAX CREATES THIS INTERESTING ILLUSION
ggyQaBY9Mq8_11 0 NOW ONE TIME IN THE GALLERY EVERYBODY WAS GOING TO DO LIFE DRAWINGS AND I THOUGHT WHAT IN THE WORLD CAN I DO
ggyQaBY9Mq8_12 0 SO I WENT AND DID SOME LIFE DRAWING CLASSES TO SEE WHAT I COULD COME UP WITH AND I TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE MODELS AND IN THIS CASE HERE I STARTED WITH THIS ONE ACTUALLY
ggyQaBY9Mq8_13 0 I TOOK THE WOMAN AND I PRINTED THE IMAGE NOT ON PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPER BUT ON SILK
ggyQaBY9Mq8_14 0 I USED SILK TRANSFER PAPER TO USE FOR THE PHOTOGRAPH CUT OUT THE SILK TOOK ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPH OF SOME FLOWERS CUT THOSE OUT AND CREATED A DRESS FOR HER HERE TOOK ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPH OF A STATUE OF A FACE AND OBSCURED IT WITH THE WAX AND PUT THE WHOLE THING ON TOP OF AN ABSTRACT DESIGN THAT I DID ON FOUR SMALL LITTLE CARDS CREATING THIS IMAGE I CALL THE RADIANT DANCER
ggyQaBY9Mq8_15 0 I KINDA LIKED THE WAY THAT TURNED OUT
ggyQaBY9Mq8_16 0 IN THIS CASE I TOOK THE MAN AND I HAD HIM PRINTED ON SILK AND I WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT TO DO WITH HIM AND I HAD SOME WAX ON A CARD THAT WAS LAYING ON THE TABLE AND WHEN I DRAPED THIS PIECE OF SILK ON TOP OF IT I COULD SEE THROUGH TO THE WAX AND JUST BY HEATING THE TOP OF THE SURFACE THE WAX CAME THROUGH AND I CALLED HIM TATTOO
HcVIsTllkuY_1 0 ALL RIGHT NOW THIS IS THE MOMENT YOU'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR
HcVIsTllkuY_2 0 YES WE ARE GOING TO DO NOW THE FULL BOSSA NOVA
HcVIsTllkuY_3 0 SO WHAT THAT ENTAILS IS THE REPEATING OSTINATO PATTERN ON THE BASS DRUM ONE TWO AND THREE FOUR AND ONE TWO AND THREE FOUR

HfmHJdiAtXk_5 0 IT IS NOT GOING TO LOOK THE BEST BUT SINCE THIS UNIT IS GOING TO BE PAINTED ANYWAYS IT WOULD DO JUST FINE
HfmHJdiAtXk_6 0 NOW IF YOU ARE BUILDING A UNIT LIKE THIS YOU CAN LEAVE THE EDGE BARE LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN PAINT IT HOWEVER IT JUST WON'T LOOK AS GOOD AS IF YOU WHERE TO PUT A PIECE OF TRIM AND THERE AND PAINTED THE TRIM

GbK52_V1kEk_2 0 AND I AM JUST GOING TO KIND OF DOING A STITCHING THOSE LITTLE LOOPS AROUND THERE JUST LIKE THIS
GbK52_V1kEk_3 0 KIND OF LIKE DOING A SPIRAL AROUND IT
GbK52_V1kEk_4 0 THAT'S ALL IT IS
GbK52_V1kEk_5 0 YOU KNOW KIND OF KEEP FOLLOWING IT ON THE INSIDE WITH YOUR FINGER AND LIKE I SAID THIS IS PROBABLY CLOSE TO THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF THE PROJECT BECAUSE YOU ARE KIND OF SEWING A LITTLE POCKET TO THE FRONT BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY GET INSIDE OF IT TO DO SO
GbK52_V1kEk_6 0 SO BUT ANYWAY I AM GOING TO KEEP DOING THIS WHIPPING STITCH AROUND
GbK52_V1kEk_7 0 I'M KIND OF IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CHIN NOW
GbK52_V1kEk_8 0 YOU CAN SORT OF STOP HALF WAY TO SORT OF SEE HOW THINGS ARE AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE STILL SQUARE AND THAT YOU ARE ON TRACK
GbK52_V1kEk_9 0 I MEAN THAT YOU HAVE NOT SEWN THE FACE TO TOO MUCH OF THE HEAD
GbK52_V1kEk_10 0 IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD
GbK52_V1kEk_11 0 YOU KNOW THE NICE THING ABOUT THIS STUFF IS BECAUSE IT IS YOU KNOW A STRETCHY KIND OF KNIT SOCK YOU CAN STRETCH IT OUT A LITTLE BIT
GbK52_V1kEk_12 0 SO IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S OVER TO ONE SIDE A LITTLE MORE JUST KIND OF START PULLING IT WHILE YOU ARE SEWING AND JUST STRETCH IT A LITTLE BIT
GbK52_V1kEk_13 0 SO ACTUALLY THAT'S WHAT I AM GOING TO DO

g-C8KxKMpEQ_1 0 IN THIS STEP I WANT TO TALK TO YOU AND SHEENA OBVIOUSLY HOW TO AND HOW TO SELECT YOUR CONCEALER
g-C8KxKMpEQ_2 0 NOW IN YOUR EXAMPLE YOU SAID YOUR SKIN TENDS TO BE A LITTLE DRIER AT THE MOMENT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF REDNESS AND SMALL BLEMISH HERE AND THERE
g-C8KxKMpEQ_3 0 I REALLY THINK THAT YOU PERSONALLY WOULD BENEFIT FROM A CONCEALER THAT HAS A NICE CREAM CONSISTENCY BUT BUT ALSO STAY PUT
g-C8KxKMpEQ_4 0 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE CONCEALER REALLY CONCEALS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO
g-C8KxKMpEQ_5 0 AND YOU ALSO DON'T WANT IT TO BLEND OFF OR SMUDGE OFF AFTER JUST A FEW MINUTES
g-C8KxKMpEQ_6 0 SINCE YOU'RE SPENDING MONEY ON A PRODUCT IT SHOULD REALLY WORK
g-C8KxKMpEQ_7 0 THERE A GOOD TRICK IS IF THE CONCEALER REALLY COVERS UP IS TO IF YOU ARE IN THE STORE AND YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO TEST YOUR PRODUCT IS TO CHECK ON THE BACK OF YOUR HAND AND TRY TO COVER UP YOU KNOW ANY BLUE VEINS THAT YOU SEE THERE USUALLY A LITTLE MORE VISIBLE ON FAIR-SKIN PEOPLE
g-C8KxKMpEQ_8 0 SO LET'S SEE I WOULD PROBABLY GO WITH SOMETHING A LITTLE YELLOW BASE I'M KIND OF IN BETWEEN THERE
g-C8KxKMpEQ_9 0 SO MAYBE THE FIRST TWO SHADES LIGHTER TOO LIKE A MEDIUM LIGHT
g-C8KxKMpEQ_10 0 AND THEN IF YOU MANAGE TO KIND OF COVER UP THE VEIN THAT'S USUALLY YOUR SHADE
g-C8KxKMpEQ_11 0 YOUR CONCEALER SHOULD ALWAYS BE SLIGHTLY LIGHTER THAN YOUR FOUNDATION

gN-l5r5ol3g_1 0 THIS IS THE TIME OF ROMANTICISM AS FAR AS THE ART HISTORICAL PERIOD IS CONCERNED

gN-l5r5ol3g_3 0 GOYA IS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS ROMANTIC ARTISTS BECAUSE BY LOOKING AT THE PAINTING YOU CAN SEE FIGHT YOU CAN SEE WAR YOU CAN SEE BLOOD YOU CAN SEE DEATH
gN-l5r5ol3g_4 0 SO THERE IS NOTHING ROMANTIC ABOUT IT
gN-l5r5ol3g_5 0 BUT IF I SAY THAT THE IDEA OF NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE SO THE POLITICAL IDEA OF NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE ITSELF COMES FROM THE FRENCH REVOLUTION
gN-l5r5ol3g_6 0 AND AFTER THE FRENCH REVOLUTION IT REVOLUTIONIZED THE WAY WITH WHICH PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THEIR NATIONAL IDENTITY AND THE VERY FACT THAT THEY CAN START THINKING ABOUT NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE IS A ROMANTIC IDEA
gN-l5r5ol3g_7 0 AND THAT SUCH A DEPICTION OF INDEPENDENCE IS ALSO ROMANTIC

GYcOjfR0fZU_2 0 NO REASON TO PANIC
GYcOjfR0fZU_3 0 THIS IS A FREQUENT THING THAT HAPPENS AND IT REALLY HAS TO DO WITH NATURAL CAUSES
GYcOjfR0fZU_4 0 WHAT FREQUENTLY CAUSES CLOUDY WATER IS OR CHEMICAL IMBALANCES IS THAT NATURALLY OCCUR
GYcOjfR0fZU_5 0 REMEMBER WE TALKED ABOUT THAT IMBALANCE OF BACTERIA THE NEGATIVE BAD KIND OF BACTERIA OVERCOMING THE BENEFICIAL BACTERIA THAT TAKES A WHILE TO BUILD UP IN A NATURALLY OCCURRING SYSTEM SUCH THAT IT'LL CAUSE CLOUDY WATER
GYcOjfR0fZU_6 0 THE OTHER THING THAT CAN HAPPEN IS YOU CAN INADVERTENTLY OVERFEED FISH AND THE WATER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE ON AND NATURALLY PURIFY IT AS IT WILL LATER ON WHEN THE AQUARIUM'S ESTABLISHED
GYcOjfR0fZU_7 0 IT'LL CAUSE A BLOOM AND CLOUDINESS
GYcOjfR0fZU_8 0 THE OTHER THING THAT CAN HAPPEN IS IF YOU HAVE TOO MUCH LIGHT TOO MUCH PHOTOSYNTHESIS TOO MUCH BIOLOGY GOING ON HERE AND IT CAUSES ALGAE TO BLOOM AND YOU CAN GET AN EFFECT LIKE THIS
GYcOjfR0fZU_9 0 NOT TO PANIC THERE ARE SOLUTIONS TO EVERY AQUARIUM SITUATION THAT COMES UP

gjL2cB-ShEE_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS GEORGE ENGLE WITH MR FIX-IT HANDYMAN IN MIAMI FLORIA AND TODAY I AM GOING TO BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO SET UP AND USE AND PERFORM DIFFERENT CUTS WITH A PORTABLE TABLE SAW
gjL2cB-ShEE_2 0 OKAY HERE WE HAVE A TABLE SAW THAT BELIEVE IT OR NOT THEY CALL IT A TABLE SAW
gjL2cB-ShEE_3 0 IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT IS STRICTLY FOR DOING RIP CUTS
gjL2cB-ShEE_4 0 YOU CAN DO MANY MANY DIFFERENT THINGS WITH THIS
gjL2cB-ShEE_5 0 THIS PARTICULAR MODEL HAS AN EXTENDABLE TABLE
gjL2cB-ShEE_6 0 IN CASE YOU ARE MAKING LARGER CUTS YOU CAN COME ALL THE WAY OUT SAY 25 1/2 INCH RIP CUTS AS LONG AS THE BOARD COMES EIGHT TEN TWELVE FEET LONG
gjL2cB-ShEE_7 0 THAT'S WHEN YOU ARE MAKING LONG CUTS
gjL2cB-ShEE_8 0 WHEN YOU ARE MAKING DETAILED CUTS ONE OF THE FEATURES I LIKE ABOUT THIS SAW IS SAY YOU NEEDED TO BE JUST A LITTLE BIT BEYOND SAY NINE INCHES OR SAY A LITTLE BIT BEYOND A CERTAIN MEASUREMENT
gjL2cB-ShEE_9 0 THIS LITTLE WHEEL HERE WHEN YOU GET IT AND FOLD IT UP AGAINST HERE YOU ARE ADJUSTING THE MEASUREMENT WITH THE WHEEL
gjL2cB-ShEE_10 0 SO IT IS NOT JUST GRAB THIS AND MOVE IT
gjL2cB-ShEE_11 0 YOU HAVE THE CONTROL OF BEING VERY PRECISE WITH THE WHEEL HERE
GE_u537I4Y4_1 0 SO YOU'VE FOUND A ENGLISH THREE SPEED AND YOU WANT TO KNOW IT IT'S VALUABLE OR NOT
GE_u537I4Y4_2 0 OR YOUR CONSIDERING BUYING ONE FROM SOMEBODY AT A YARD SALE AND YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME IDEAS WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT WORTH THE MONEY
GE_u537I4Y4_3 0 FIRST OF ALL HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S A ENGLISH THREE SPEED
GE_u537I4Y4_4 0 WELL GENERALLY THEIR GOING TO HAVE A DECAL ALONG THE TOP THAT SAYS MADE IN ENGLAND AND ANOTHER THING IS THEIR GOING TO HAVE A THREE SPEED THUMB SHIFTER AND WHAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN VALUE IN THESE TWO BIKES
GE_u537I4Y4_5 0 THIS MAYBE SAY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR BIKE AND THIS PROBABLY AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY
GE_u537I4Y4_6 0 MAYBE MUCH MORE
GE_u537I4Y4_7 0 CONSERVATIVELY A THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR BIKE
GE_u537I4Y4_8 0 ONE THING THIS IS MALE BIKE THAT'S A FEMALE STYLE
GE_u537I4Y4_9 0 THERE ARE A LOT MORE OF THESE AROUND THEN THERE ARE OF THESE
GE_u537I4Y4_10 0 THIS HAS A LEATHER SADDLE A LEATHER BROOKS MAKES IT MUCH MORE VALUABLE
GE_u537I4Y4_11 0 IT HAS THE ROD BRAKES AND THESE TIRES THESE WHEELS ARE TWENTY EIGHT INCHES AND A NORMAL BIKE A NORMAL ENGLISH BIKE AND OTHERS ARE GOING TO BE AROUND TWENTY SIX INCHES FOR A ADULT BIKE BUT THIS HAS TWENTY EIGHT INCH RIMS
GE_u537I4Y4_12 0 WHICH MAKE IT A VERY DESIRABLE BIKE
GE_u537I4Y4_13 0 ANOTHER THING IS FRAME SIZE
GE_u537I4Y4_14 0 THIS IS A VERY VERY LARGE FRAME AND IN GENERAL THE LARGER THE FRAME ON THE BIKE THE MORE VALUABLE THE BIKE IS
GE_u537I4Y4_15 0 IT MIGHT NOT BE A RIDER FOR MANY PEOPLE BUT FOR A COLLECTIBLE THE BIGGER THE FRAME THE BETTER IT IS
gCYhLKkdZbk_1 0 TODAY WERE GOING TO CHANGING THE FLUID IN OUR FOUR WHEEL DRIVE TRANSFER CASE
gCYhLKkdZbk_2 0 IN THIS STEP I AM GOING TO DEMONSTRATE THE PROPER JACKING PROCEDURE FOR GETTING THE FRONT END OF OUR TRUCK UP SO WE CAN FIT UNDERNEATH TO CHANGE OUR TRANSFER CASE FLUID
gCYhLKkdZbk_3 0 NOW WHAT WERE AIMING FOR THE FRONT AXLE ON THIS VEHICLE
gCYhLKkdZbk_4 0 THE FRONT AXLE IS GOING TO BE A LARGE PIECE OF METAL AND I AM GOING TO SLIP MY FLOOR JACK RIGHT UNDER THE CENTER OF IT
gCYhLKkdZbk_5 0 LET ME GO AHEAD AND SNUG IT DOWN AND BEGAN JACKING IT UP
gCYhLKkdZbk_7 0 YOUR GOING TO WANT TO TAKE IT UP A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT SO YOU CAN FIT UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE AND BE ABLE TO DO ALL THE MANIPULATIONS THAT YOUR GOING TO HAVE TO
gCYhLKkdZbk_8 0 SO WERE GOING TO TAKE IT UP A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT AND SET IT ON OUR JACK STANDS
gCYhLKkdZbk_9 0 THAT SHOULD BE HIGH ENOUGH
gCYhLKkdZbk_10 0 ALRIGHT I AM GOING TO TAKE AND SLIP MY JACK STANDS UNDER THE INNER LIP ON THE CONTROL ARM
gCYhLKkdZbk_12 0 RIGHT THERE YOU CAN GET A REALLY GOOD LOOK AT THIS ONE ON THIS SIDE
gCYhLKkdZbk_13 0 AND I CAN SHOW YOU WHERE WERE SHOOTING FOR
gCYhLKkdZbk_14 0 RIGHT HERE IS YOUR LOWER CONTROL ARM AND IT BEARS MOST OF THE WEIGHT FOR THE SUSPENSION ITS MADE OF A HEAVY GAGE STAMPED METAL AND ITS STURDY ENOUGH TO HOLD THE VEHICLE UP
gCYhLKkdZbk_15 0 THERE S A CUT OUT IN YOUR JACK STAND CUP AND WERE GOING TO SLIP THAT LIP RIGHT ON TO THE CUT OUT
gCYhLKkdZbk_16 0 I AM GOING TO GO AHEAD AND ADJUST THIS ONE UP AS WELL
gCYhLKkdZbk_18 0 ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR JACK STANDS SET YOU CAN VERY SLOWLY RELEASE THE PRESSURE ON YOUR FLOOR JACK
gCYhLKkdZbk_19 0 RIGHT THERE AND WERE GOING TO LET OUT JACK COLLAPSE ALL THE WAY AND ROLL IT OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE
gCYhLKkdZbk_20 0 THAT IS THE PROPER SERVICE PROCEDURE FOR JACKING UP YOUR VEHICLE
gCYhLKkdZbk_21 0 PLACING YOUR JACK STANDS AND SETTLING THE VEHICLE DOWN ON TO THOSE STANDS
gupPatBYC4I_1 0 NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PAINT THE STYROFOAM BALL MEANING THAT THE STYROFOAM BALL IS GOING TO BE SITTING AT PRETTY MUCH IT'S GOING TO BE THE CENTER OF THE WINDMILL WHERE ALL THE ARMS ARE GOING TO BE HANGING
gupPatBYC4I_2 0 IT'S GOING TO BE WHAT IS WHAT THE EYE IS GOING TO CATCH FIRST WHEN LOOKING AT THE WINDMILL
gupPatBYC4I_3 0 SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE PAINTING IT WE'RE GOING TO USE- FOR OUR WINDMILL WE'LL GIVE IT A NICE PURPLE COLOR AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REAL NEED TO DECORATE IT IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT COLORS OR ANY WILD WAY BUT YOU WANT TO USE A COLOR SCHEME THAT IT SHOULD FIT IN WITH THE REGULAR BODY OF THE MILK CARTON WHICH IS GOING TO BE THE BODY OF THE WINDMILL
gupPatBYC4I_4 0 SO IT'S ALSO EASY TO PAINT IT WHILE IT'S ON THE STICK BECAUSE A BALL IS HARD TO GRIP WHILE PAINTING IT SO THIS WAY IT GIVES US A WAY TO HOLD ONTO THE BALL AND GET ALL SIDES UNDERNEATH AND ON TOP ALL AROUND THE BALL VERY EASILY WHILE IT'S ON THE STICK
gupPatBYC4I_5 0 IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE STICK GETS PAINT ON IT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE INSERTED INTO THE MILK CARTON
gupPatBYC4I_6 0 THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOING TO BE SEEN FROM THE OUTSIDE IS BASICALLY THE BALL ITSELF
gupPatBYC4I_7 0 ON THE TOP PART THERE'S GOING TO BE A BEAD PLACED ON IT SO THAT IT THE BALL WILL SIT SECURELY AND WON'T FALL OFF THE STICK
gupPatBYC4I_8 0 ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AS WELL THERE WILL BE A BEAD ANY PART OF THE STICK RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE BALL IS GOING TO BE INSIDE AGAINST THE MILK CARTOON SO YOU REALLY WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING THE STICK DIRTY WHILE YOU'RE PAINTING IT
gupPatBYC4I_9 0 ONCE IT'S ALL COVERED WE CAN LET IT SIT AND WE CAN GET IT READY FOR PUTTING INSIDE THE MILK CARTOON

GLYG4SXr8TI_3 0 SIG HAUER AND I'M SIG HAUER AND WE'RE PROFESSIONAL PRACTITIONERS OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE
GLYG4SXr8TI_4 0 SARAH HAUER WE'RE HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GLYG4SXr8TI_5 0 SIG HAUER AND WELCOME TO OUR VIDEO
GLYG4SXr8TI_6 0 WE'LL ALSO TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF THE HERBS LIKE SWEET HERBS
GLYG4SXr8TI_7 0 GOU QI BERRIES FOR EXAMPLE IS A SWEET HERB
GLYG4SXr8TI_8 0 A SOUR HERB FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE GUA LOU THE TRICHOSANTHES
GLYG4SXr8TI_9 0 THERE ARE OTHER CATEGORIES LIKE BITTER HUANG LIAN IS A VERY BITTER HERB
GLYG4SXr8TI_10 0 SO THE FLAVOR OF THE HERB IS VERY IMPORTANT AS WELL AND ONE HERB DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE JUST ONE FLAVOR
GLYG4SXr8TI_11 0 SOMETIMES AN HERB CAN HAVE FIVE DIFFERENT FLAVORS
GLYG4SXr8TI_12 0 AND A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT I'LL PULL ONE OFF THE SHELF HERE FOR YOU IS WU WEI ZU WHICH LITERALLY MEANS FIVE-FLAVORED SEED AND IT HAS THE FIVE MAJOR FLAVORS THAT WE TALK ABOUT IN CHINESE HERBS
GLYG4SXr8TI_13 0 SO THE FIVE FLAVORS IS SWEET SALTY SOUR BITTER AND PUNGENT
GLYG4SXr8TI_14 0 AND THERE'S ALSO A SIXTH FLAVOR WHICH IS NEUTRAL BLAND BUT THAT'S NOT CONSIDERED PART OF THIS
GLYG4SXr8TI_15 0 BUT AGAIN THIS IS CALLED SARAH HAUER YOU KEEP MOVING YOUR HAND

gv4KYhu18OM_4 0 FIRST WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS HAVE YOUR FEET SHOULDER WIDTH APART
gv4KYhu18OM_5 0 AND KNEES SLIGHTLY BENT SHOULDERS RELAXED
gv4KYhu18OM_6 0 AND I WANT YOU TO GOING AHEAD AND LOOK UP TOWARDS THE SKY
gv4KYhu18OM_7 0 LENGTHEN AND STRETCH
gv4KYhu18OM_8 0 YOU CAN HOLD THIS POSITION FOR ABOUT FIVE TO TEN SECONDS
gv4KYhu18OM_9 0 COME BACK TO YOUR CENTER POSITION
gv4KYhu18OM_10 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND STRETCH THE LEFT SIDE
gv4KYhu18OM_11 0 JUST WANT TO EXTEND THE NECK SLIGHTLY WITHOUT TWEAKING
gv4KYhu18OM_12 0 KEEPING THE SHOULDERS DOWN AND RELAXED
gv4KYhu18OM_13 0 FIRST YOU'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS POSITION FOR FIVE TO TEN SECONDS
gv4KYhu18OM_14 0 MAKE SURE YOU'RE BREATHING DEEP BREATHS IN AND OUT
gv4KYhu18OM_15 0 YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE IT BACK TO CENTER
gv4KYhu18OM_16 0 AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR CHIN DOWN TO YOUR CHEST
gv4KYhu18OM_17 0 TURN TOTALLY RELAX THE SHOULDERS
gv4KYhu18OM_18 0 MAKE SURE YOU'RE TAKING NICE SLOW BREATHS IN AND OUT
gv4KYhu18OM_19 0 YOU CAN HOLD THIS POSITION FIVE TO TEN SECONDS
gv4KYhu18OM_21 0 NOW BRING YOUR POSITION BACK TO CENTER
gv4KYhu18OM_22 0 TURN TO THE RIGHT
gv4KYhu18OM_23 0 NOW LOOK YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT PAST YOUR SHOULDER
gv4KYhu18OM_24 0 JUST HAVING A NICE GENTLE STRETCH
gv4KYhu18OM_25 0 FOCUS ON BREATHING
gv4KYhu18OM_26 0 RELAXING YOUR SHOULDERS AND UPPER BACK
gv4KYhu18OM_27 0 HOLD IT ABOUT FIVE TO TEN SECONDS
gv4KYhu18OM_29 0 BRING IT BACK TO CENTER
gv4KYhu18OM_30 0 AGAIN THIS IS HOW YOU STRETCH YOUR NECK
glmpBO0gR14_1 0 I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE SEE THESE LONG NECKLACES AND GO I CAN'T WEAR THAT
glmpBO0gR14_2 0 WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH THAT
glmpBO0gR14_3 0 THESE ARE REALLY TERRIFIC BECAUSE THEY'RE LIGHTWEIGHT AND THEY LOOK VERY DRAMATIC AND THEY GIVE YOU QUITE A FLAIR
glmpBO0gR14_4 0 SO HERE AGAIN WE'RE BACK TO OUR VERY BASIC BLACK
glmpBO0gR14_5 0 AGAIN IF YOU DON'T LIKE WEARING SCARVES A GREAT OPTION WOULD THEN BE TO DOUBLE OVER THE LOOPED NECKLACE
glmpBO0gR14_6 0 THAT SORT OF FILLS IN BREAKS UP SOME OF THE BLACK
glmpBO0gR14_7 0 AND THEN YOU COULD ADD A PAIR OF GOLD HOOP EARRINGS
glmpBO0gR14_8 0 OR YOU COULD ADD SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT SIMPLER
glmpBO0gR14_9 0 JUST A LITTLE BLACK AND GOLD DROP
glmpBO0gR14_10 0 OR EVEN JUST A SIMPLE BLACK
glmpBO0gR14_11 0 AGAIN YOU CAN SOMETHING WITH A LITTLE MORE DRAMATIC FLAIR
glmpBO0gR14_12 0 YOU COULD PUT THE GOLD BRACELET
glmpBO0gR14_13 0 OR IF YOU WANT TO KEEP SOMETHING SIMPLER WITH THE BANGLE BRACELET
glmpBO0gR14_14 0 SEE AGAIN THAT ALL WORKS TOGETHER
glmpBO0gR14_15 0 NOW PEARLS ARE ALSO A GREAT WAY TO GO AND I LOVE PEARLS
glmpBO0gR14_16 0 AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO LOOK LIKE OLD AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL OLD-FASHIONED IN THEM
glmpBO0gR14_17 0 A LOT OF PEARLS ARE LONG VERY VERY LONG
glmpBO0gR14_18 0 AND THAT CAN BE A LITTLE HARD TO WEAR SOMETIMES
glmpBO0gR14_19 0 ESPECIALLY FOR WORK AND BUSINESS
glmpBO0gR14_20 0 THEY KNOCK AROUND A BIT TOO MUCH AT THE DESK
glmpBO0gR14_21 0 SO YOU CAN JUST EASILY DOUBLE THEM OVER
glmpBO0gR14_22 0 NOW HERE'S ANOTHER LITTLE TRICK NOT TO FORGET
glmpBO0gR14_23 0 DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO STOP THERE WITH JUST A PEARL NECKLACE
glmpBO0gR14_24 0 YOU STILL COULD ADD IN A SCARF
glmpBO0gR14_25 0 THAT'S STILL ARTFULLY TIED AND I'M JUST DOING THIS VERY QUICK THIS STILL WOULD WORK FOR YOU
glmpBO0gR14_26 0 AND JUST KEEP A LITTLE BIT MORE INTEREST GOING AROUND YOUR FACE
glmpBO0gR14_27 0 AND AGAIN IF YOU WERE IN A SIMPLE OUTFIT THAT SORT OF JUST KIND OF GIVES THAT SIMPLE OUTFIT A BIT OF PIZZAZZ TO ADD THAT EXTRA SCARF IN THERE
glmpBO0gR14_29 0 A PEARL EARRING AND YOU'RE READY TO GO
glmpBO0gR14_30 0 THAT WOULD TAKE YOU TO A LUNCHEON THAT WOULD TAKE A LOVELY BUSINESS MEETING
glmpBO0gR14_31 0 IT COULD EVEN TAKE YOU INTO A DINNER MEETING
glmpBO0gR14_32 0 SO THAT'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT YOU COULD DO WITH THE ACCESSORIES
glmpBO0gR14_33 0 SO KEEP AGAIN IN MIND THAT YOU WANT TO BUILD YOUR ACCESSORY CAPSULE THE SAME WAY YOU DID YOUR CLOTHING WITH KEEPING THREE ELEMENTS GOING ON
GMb3xV0OizA_1 0 GRACE FRAGA WE ALREADY HAVE CUT OUR LITTLE PATCHES TWO PATCHES
GMb3xV0OizA_2 0 AND NOW IT'S TIME TO DESIGN THE T-SHIRT
GMb3xV0OizA_3 0 SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TIPS YOU GIVE US TO DESIGN THE T-SHIRT
GMb3xV0OizA_4 0 CHANTELLE TIBBS WHEN I DESIGN THE ORIGINAL REDISTRIBUTE THERE'S A STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY LOOK AT YOUR CLOTHES THEY LOOK AT YOU ANYTHING THAT'S WRITTEN THEY LOOK RIGHT HERE
GMb3xV0OizA_5 0 SO I ALWAYS TRY TO KEEP MY WORDS UP HERE
GMb3xV0OizA_6 0 AND NOW SOME FOLKS HAVE THEIR WORDS LOWER BUT THIS IS THE EYELINE
GMb3xV0OizA_7 0 IF YOU WANT SOMETHING YOU REALLY WANTED TO BE SAID THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO PUT IT
GMb3xV0OizA_8 0 YOU CAN ALSO PUT IT ON YOUR BACK OF YOUR SHIRT THAT'S THE SAME THING IT'S THE EYELINE
GMb3xV0OizA_9 0 AND IT'S UP IN LIKE THE TOP OF THE CHEST AREA
GMb3xV0OizA_10 0 SO THAT'S WHERE I DECIDED TO PUT THE REDISTRIBUTE BUT REMEMBER YOU'RE THE ARTIST YOU CAN PUT IT ANYWHERE YOU WANT
GMb3xV0OizA_11 0 SO I'M GOING TO PLACE THIS RIGHT HERE ON THE UPPER LEFT CORNER OF THE SHIRT EYELINE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE THE WORD REDISTRIBUTE
GMb3xV0OizA_12 0 NOW REDISTRIBUTE HAS A LOT OF MEANING TO ME SO REDISTRIBUTE IS KINDA OF I GUESS IT'S KIND OF SOCIALIST BUT IT'S IN THE SENSE OF JUST LIKE YOU HAVE LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING AND YOU'RE NOT USING IT THAT YOU SHOULD REDISTRIBUTE IT
GMb3xV0OizA_13 0 EVERY YEAR GRACE FRAGA LIKE BREASTS
GMb3xV0OizA_14 0 CHANTELLE TIBBS YEAH IF YOU GRACE FRAGA THERE YOU GO
GMb3xV0OizA_15 0 CHANTELLE TIBBS IF YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF BREASTS AND SOMEBODY NEEDS AND A BUTT YOU CAN JUST DONATE SOME OF THAT SOME BUTT
GMb3xV0OizA_16 0 GRACE FRAGA YOU CAN JUST DO IT AND THAT'S THE MESSAGE
GMb3xV0OizA_17 0 THAT'S VERY GENEROUS
GMb3xV0OizA_18 0 CHANTELLE TIBBS THAT'S RIGHT YEAH
GMb3xV0OizA_19 0 BUT AND PRETTY MUCH WE HAVE A PROJECT CALLED REDISTRIBUTE EVERY YEAR AND LAST YEAR IT WAS MY FRIEND'S PLACE
GMb3xV0OizA_20 0 THIS YEAR IT'S THE YOUTH ALLIANCE ON THE HATE
GMb3xV0OizA_21 0 AND PRETTY MUCH WHAT I DO IS I DONATE
GMb3xV0OizA_22 0 I TAKE SHIRTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE AT LIKE THE GOODWILL OR SHIRTS THAT YOU WOULD TAKE TO THE GOODWILL OR SHIRTS YOU DON'T WANT ANYMORE AND I REDESIGN THEM
GMb3xV0OizA_23 0 I COVER UP THINGS AND I FIX THE SHIRT AND I MAKE AND I GIVE THEM AWAY
GMb3xV0OizA_24 0 SO THAT'S AN EVERY YEAR PROJECT FOR US AND I CALL IT PROJECT REDISTRIBUTE
GMb3xV0OizA_25 0 SO WE HAVE A SHIRT THAT SAYS GRACE FRAGA NICE
GMb3xV0OizA_26 0 CHANTELLE TIBBS REDISTRIBUTE
GMb3xV0OizA_27 0 NOW I'M GOING TO PUT THIS EYE
GMb3xV0OizA_28 0 AND THIS IS DESIGN IS BASED OFF OF A IT'S LIKE A FLAME OR GRACE FRAGA YEAH

Gvo_YK6zbu0_2 0 I'M MATT CAIL AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A CAT COSTUME FOR THIS HALLOWEEN
Gvo_YK6zbu0_3 0 LET'S TAKE UP OUR CAT COSTUME FROM BOTTOM TO TOP
Gvo_YK6zbu0_4 0 WE'RE GOING TO START OFF WITH THE FEET
Gvo_YK6zbu0_5 0 FOR THE FEET YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TWO ITEMS
Gvo_YK6zbu0_6 0 FIRST OFF YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOME BLACK SOCKS SOME GOOD OLD BASIC BLACK SOCKS
Gvo_YK6zbu0_7 0 THAT'S GOING TO GET IT DONE FOR YOU
Gvo_YK6zbu0_8 0 YOU CAN GET THESE BLACK SOCKS IN MOST CONVENIENT STORES
Gvo_YK6zbu0_9 0 OUR OVERALL COSTUME IS GOING TO BE BLACK
Gvo_YK6zbu0_10 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE A BLACK CAT ON HALLOWEEN SO DEFINITELY GET YOURSELF SOME BLACK SOCKS
Gvo_YK6zbu0_11 0 YOU MAY OWN SOME ALREADY
Gvo_YK6zbu0_12 0 THEY'RE CERTAINLY MUCH MORE COMMON THAN THEY USED TO BE
Gvo_YK6zbu0_13 0 AS LONG AS THEY'RE NOT THE REALLY FORMAL SOCKS WHICH TEND TO FALL DOWN OFF YOUR ANKLES WITHIN THE FIRST FIVE SECONDS OF PUTTING THEM ON
Gvo_YK6zbu0_14 0 IT'S GOING TO GREAT
Gvo_YK6zbu0_15 0 YOU'RE GOING TO WANT SOME SOCKS THAT ARE GOING TO BE STAYING UP SO YOU DON'T WANT THE SOCKS THAT END RIGHT ON YOUR ANKLE EITHER
Gvo_YK6zbu0_16 0 DEFINITELY UP TO YOUR MID CALF BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE COVERING UP ANY FLESH COLORED PARTS OF OUR BODY SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO PUT MAKEUP OVER EVERYTHING
Gvo_YK6zbu0_17 0 IN ADDITION SHOES
Gvo_YK6zbu0_18 0 ANY TYPE OF GENERAL BLACK SHOES WILL DO
Gvo_YK6zbu0_19 0 IF YOU EXPECT TO BE IN A LOT OF SLIPPERY SURFACES I DON'T RECOMMEND HAVING A REALLY FLAT BOTTOM
Gvo_YK6zbu0_20 0 SLICK BOTTOM SHOES ARE GOING TO BE SLIPPING ALL NIGHT LONG
Gvo_YK6zbu0_21 0 YOU CAN ALSO OF COURSE THE MORE INDUSTRIAL TYPE OF SHOES LIKE THE TOUGHER TYPE OF SHOES
Gvo_YK6zbu0_22 0 KEEP IN MIND IF YOU'RE GOING FOR MORE OF CAT LIKE LOOK LOOKING LIKE A FELINE
Gvo_YK6zbu0_23 0 FELINES ARE LITTLE MORE PETITE A LITTLE MORE GRACEFUL A LITTLE QUITE LESS CLUNKY SO TO SPEAK
Gvo_YK6zbu0_24 0 DEFINITELY KEEP THAT IN MIND WITH YOUR SHOE CHOICE
he951qDdm2Y_1 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE MOMENT IN A HAND WHEN YOU REALIZE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN THIS HAND OF BARONESS
he951qDdm2Y_2 0 THE SITUATION IS THAT THE STOCKPILE IS THIN
he951qDdm2Y_3 0 REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS THICK WELL NOW IT'S THIN BECAUSE THE CARDS HAVE EITHER BEEN MOVED TO THE TABLEAU OR THEY HAVE BEEN MOVED OFF THE TABLEAU INTO THE FOUNDATION
he951qDdm2Y_4 0 THE STOCKPILE IS THIN THE TABLEAU HAS A GOOD NUMBER OF CARDS ON IT
he951qDdm2Y_5 0 AND WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT CARDS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE A COMBINATION THAT ADDS UP TO THIRTEEN ARE LOCKED
he951qDdm2Y_6 0 AND HOW DOES A CARD BECOME LOCKED
he951qDdm2Y_7 0 WELL IT'S LIKE THIS
he951qDdm2Y_8 0 IF YOU LOOK OVER HERE WHERE THIS QUEEN IS THE QUEEN NEEDS AN ACE
he951qDdm2Y_9 0 THE ACE NEEDS A QUEEN
he951qDdm2Y_10 0 BUT YOU CAN ONLY PLAY THE TOP CARD OF EACH PILE
he951qDdm2Y_11 0 SO THE FACT THAT THESE TWO ACES ARE BURIED BENEATH THIS QUEEN MEANS THAT THEY CAN'T BE PLAYED
he951qDdm2Y_12 0 AND I'M HOPING THAT ANOTHER ACE COMES OUT
he951qDdm2Y_13 0 BUT THERE ARE ONLY TWO OTHER ACES LEFT RIGHT
he951qDdm2Y_14 0 THIS HAPPENED AGAIN WITH JACKS AND TWOS CARDS ARE LOCKED UP
he951qDdm2Y_15 0 SO WHEN YOU SEE CARDS LOCKED UP LIKE THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO HOPE FOR A LOW SCORE AND YOU'RE LIKELY NOT GOING TO WIN
HFOuxMS0nL4_1 0 NOW THAT WE'VE LAYERED OUR SEA SALT AND EPSOM SALT WE'VE GOT THE PINK COLOR THAT'S THE ROSE SCENTED AND THE WHITE WHICH IS THE VANILLA SCENTED WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUR LID ON OUR JAR AND WE'RE GOING TO SPRUCE IT UP WITH SOME CURLING RIBBON
HFOuxMS0nL4_2 0 I'VE GOT SOME WHITE HERE AND I'VE GOT SOME RED AND I'M JUST GOING TO TIE THIS RIGHT HERE IN A BOW
HFOuxMS0nL4_3 0 BETTER MOVE MY OIL OUT OF THE WAY OR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A ROSE AND VANILLA EXPLOSION IN HERE
HFOuxMS0nL4_4 0 THERE WE GO
HFOuxMS0nL4_5 0 TIE THIS BOW JUST LIKE THIS AND BECAUSE IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY WE CAN'T JUST HAVE WHITE WE ALSO HAVE GOT TO GET SOME RED IN THERE AND THIS IS A GREAT GIFT
HFOuxMS0nL4_6 0 IT IS INEXPENSIVE IT'S EASY TO MAKE IT'S FUN IT SMELLS GREAT AND BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING FOR A FRIEND THAT EXPRESSES THAT YOU WANT THEM TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES THEY KNOW THAT YOU CARE ABOUT THEM AND THERE REALLY IS NO BETTER GIFT THAN THAT
HFOuxMS0nL4_7 0 O.K NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR AND WE'RE SIMPLY GOING TO CURL THE ENDS OF OUR RIBBON
HFOuxMS0nL4_8 0 MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE FESTIVE JUST LIKE THAT
HAjdqjbepjc_1 0 NOW SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO OR SHOULD DO IN A LARGE CLASSROOM IS ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION
HAjdqjbepjc_2 0 WELL HOW DO YOU ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION
HAjdqjbepjc_3 0 THAT'S SOMETIMES DIFFICULT
HAjdqjbepjc_4 0 THE FIRST THING THAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS CREATE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT BY CREATING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT IS MAKE STUDENTS FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT WHAT THEY HAVE TO ADD TO A DISCUSSION WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY IN CLASS MATTERS AND THAT IT'S NOT JUST STUPID OR THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE MADE FUN OF OR THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE CALLED DOWN FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION FOR THE COMMENTS THAT THEY MAKE
HAjdqjbepjc_5 0 ANOTHER THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO PRACTICE ENTHUSIASM
HAjdqjbepjc_6 0 IF YOU ARE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT YOUR SUBJECT THEN YOUR STUDENTS WILL GET ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT AND THEY WILL WANT TO PARTICIPATE MORE
HAjdqjbepjc_7 0 YOU CAN ALSO PLAN PARTICIPATION ACTIVITIES
HAjdqjbepjc_8 0 OK ON FRIDAY WE'RE ALL GOING TO GO AROUND THE ROOM AND WE'RE GOING TO TELL WHATEVER IT IS WE'RE GOING TO TELL SO THAT THE STUDENTS HAVE TIME TO PLAN BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE PARTICIPATING
HAjdqjbepjc_9 0 YOU CAN CALL ON STUDENTS RATHER THAN WAITING FOR THEM TO VOLUNTEER
HAjdqjbepjc_10 0 IF YOU'RE NOT REALLY HAVING ANY PARTICIPATION IN YOUR CLASSROOM THIS IS ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU WANT TO LEARN THEIR NAMES
HAjdqjbepjc_11 0 CALL ON THEM NOT CALL THEM OUT BUT CALL ON THEM TO SEE WHAT THEY HAVE TO ADD TO THE CONVERSATION
HAjdqjbepjc_12 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE A QUESTION BOX WHERE STUDENTS COULD RIGHT DOWN QUESTIONS WRITE DOWN THOUGHTS AND THEN YOU COULD READ THEM ALOUD IN FRONT OF THE CLASS AND THAT COULD ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION
HAjdqjbepjc_13 0 YOU COULD READ ANONYMOUSLY WORKS SUBMITTED BY A STUDENT AND THAT CAN SOMETIMES GENERATE PARTICIPATION IN THE CLASSROOM BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE ON WITH THIS INCREASING SENSE OF COMMUNITY THAT YOU ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION IN YOUR CLASS REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE
gji7EfzB92Y_1 0 OKAY LET'S START BY MARKING OFF WHERE WE WANT TO PLACE OUR BEADS
gji7EfzB92Y_2 0 I WANT TO PLACE MY BEADS AT ONE INCH INTERVALS ALONG THE EDGE AND I'M GOING TO JUST TAKE PINS
gji7EfzB92Y_3 0 I'M NOT GOING TO MARK THE CORNER THAT'S THE BEGINNING AND WE KNOW WHERE THAT IS AND JUST TAKE PINS
gji7EfzB92Y_4 0 PUT YOUR RULER ALONG THE EDGE OF THE FABRIC AND JUST STICK IN THE PINS GENTLY JUST A LITTLE BIT JUST ENOUGH TO MARK THE PLACE ONE IN ONE INCH INTERVALS AND GO ALL THE WAY DOWN
gji7EfzB92Y_5 0 NOW YOU CAN MAKE YOUR BEADS CLOSER
gji7EfzB92Y_6 0 IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU LIKE TO DO BUT FOR THIS PROJECT ONE INCH IS GOOD AND GO ALL THE WAY DOWN ONE EDGE THERE
gji7EfzB92Y_7 0 NOW YOU CAN ALSO MARK YOUR WORK WITH A FABRIC PIN THAT IS WASHABLE BUT I PREFER TO USE THE PINS BECAUSE THEN I DON'T HAVE TO WASH THE PROJECT AFTER
gji7EfzB92Y_8 0 NOW AS YOU CAN SEE MY NAPKIN ISN'T EXACTLY GIVING ME AN INCH TO THE END SO I AM GOING TO JUST NOT DO AN INCH BUT JUST KIND OF EYE EACH ONE A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PRECISE UNTIL IT LOOKS NICE
gji7EfzB92Y_9 0 I'LL MOVE THIS ONE A LITTLE BIT OVER
gji7EfzB92Y_10 0 YOU CAN ALSO MEASURE THE PROJECT AND DO SOME SIMPLE DIVISIONS
gji7EfzB92Y_11 0 FIND OUT WHAT THE EXACT INTERVALS SHOULD BE BUT FOR THIS PROJECT JUST EYING IT IS GOING TO WORK OKAY
HjvJlOmFebE_1 0 HI I'M NANCY FRENSLEY WITH THE BERKELY EAST BAY HUMANE SOCIETY I'M THE TRAINING MANGER
HjvJlOmFebE_2 0 AND THIS IS MY FRIEND LOLLY WHO IS MY DOG SHE'S AN AUSTRALIAN SHEPARD AND SHE'S GOING TO HELP ME TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE AMERICAN PIT BULL TERRIER
HjvJlOmFebE_3 0 SHE HAS A LOT OF FRIENDS WHO ARE AMERICAN PIT BULL TERRIERS AND THEY HAVE BECOME ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR BREEDS SIMPLY BY DEFAULT THAT WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY
HjvJlOmFebE_4 0 AND PART OF THAT IS THAT THEY HAVE A VERY SAD HERITAGE HAVING COME FROM THE FIGHTING BIDS AND BEEN BRED AND BRED AND BRED AND BRED UNTIL THEY'RE SO MANY OF THEM THAT IF YOU GO INTO A MUNICIPAL SHELTER IN A CITY YOU'LL SEE MOSTLY AMERICAN PIT BULL TERRIERS
HjvJlOmFebE_5 0 THEY MAKE REALLY GREAT PETS WITH A COUPLE OF CAUTIONS
HjvJlOmFebE_6 0 YOU COULDN'T ASK FOR A DOG THAT WOULD BE BETTER WITH PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE BETTER WITH YOU WITH YOUR FAMILY BUT THEY HAVE TO BE SOCIALIZED FROM A VERY EARLY AGE AND FROM A VERY EARLY AGE SOCIALIZED WITH OTHER DOGS
HjvJlOmFebE_7 0 YOUR AMERICAN PIT BULL TERRIER MIGHT NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR HERITAGE BE ABLE TO READ THE SIGNALS OF OTHER DOGS OR KNOW WHEN TO STOP AND THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE PLAYING WITH OTHER DOGS WHEN THEY ARE INCLINED TO GET INTO TROUBLE
HjvJlOmFebE_8 0 SO YOUR AMERICAN PIT BULL TERRIER WILL NEED ALL THE STANDARD THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF A DOG VETERINARY CARE THEY NEED GOOD COAT CARE THEY NEED A GOOD DIET THE NEED ENOUGH EXERCISE TO REALLY WEAR THEM OUT A BIT AND THEY NEED GOOD MENTAL EXERCISE TO KEEP THEM INSIDE THEMSELVES SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE THEY GET EXCITED REALLY FAST AND COULD GO OUT OF CONTROL REALLY FAST
HjvJlOmFebE_9 0 BUT IF YOU START FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WITH YOUR AMERICAN PIT BULL TERRIER PUTTING BOUNDARIES ON THEM LETTING THEM KNOW HOW FAR THEY CAN GO STOPPING THEM WHEN YOU'RE READY TO STOP THEM AND ALWAYS REWARDING THEM FOR THE GOOD THINGS THAT THEY DO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT LIFE WITH YOUR AMERICAN PIT BULL TERRIER
gm9xAQEhc44_1 0 COACH RUDY HERE
gm9xAQEhc44_2 0 I'VE WON CHAMPIONSHIPS BOTH AS A COACH AND A PLAYER
gm9xAQEhc44_3 0 DEFENSE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS
gm9xAQEhc44_4 0 DEFENSE EQUALS REBOUNDING REBOUNDING EQUALS BOXING OUT
gm9xAQEhc44_5 0 BOXING OUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF COURAGE TO BOX OUT
gm9xAQEhc44_6 0 WHOEVER SAID BASKETBALL WASN'T A CONTACT SPORT HAS NEVER PLAYED THE GAME
gm9xAQEhc44_7 0 IN ORDER TO BOX OUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO UP AGAINST GUYS THAT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THAN YOU MAY BE A LITTLE BIT STRONGER BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO GET THE JOB DONE
gm9xAQEhc44_8 0 THE KEY IS USING YOUR HIPS
gm9xAQEhc44_9 0 ESTABLISHING A LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY
gm9xAQEhc44_10 0 YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO PUSH ON PEOPLE OR GET YOUR ARMS UP
gm9xAQEhc44_11 0 YOU KEEP YOUR ARMS RIGHT AT SHOULDER LEVEL RIGHT AND YOU ESTABLISH A WIDE BASE
gm9xAQEhc44_12 0 PEOPLE START PUSHING ON YOU USE YOUR HIPS TO ESTABLISH LEVERAGE AND PUSH BACK ON THEM
gm9xAQEhc44_13 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH SPACE IN BETWEEN YOURSELF AND THE RIM SO WHEN THE BALL COMES OFF YOU CAN REBOUND IT EASILY
gm9xAQEhc44_14 0 A LOT OF YOUNG GUYS MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BOXING OUT TOO CLOSE TO THE RIM
gm9xAQEhc44_15 0 BALL COMES OUT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEY DON'T GET THE FOUL CALLED BECAUSE THE PLAYER THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO BOX OUT IS EASILY ABLE TO GET THE REBOUND
gm9xAQEhc44_16 0 SO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT TOO CLOSE TO THE RIM AT LEAST TWO FEET AWAY AS YOU'RE BOXING OUT
gm9xAQEhc44_17 0 LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY WITH THE HIPS ESTABLISH THE BASE WITH THE ARMS
gm9xAQEhc44_18 0 YOU'RE NOT THROWING ELBOWS BUT YOU'VE GOT THEM OUT THERE
gm9xAQEhc44_19 0 BALL COMES OFF THE RIM IT'S POSITION FIRST CONTACT FIRST YOU'RE MAKING SURE YOU FEEL THE OTHER GUY FIRST AND THEN YOU GO FOR THE BALL
gm9xAQEhc44_20 0 IF YOU BOX OUT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE FEELING CONTACT FIRST BEFORE YOU GO FOR THE BALL
gm9xAQEhc44_21 0 IF YOU JUST GO FOR THE BALL WITHOUT ESTABLISHING CONTACT A REALLY SMART PLAYER LIKE MYSELF WILL SLIDE IN FRONT OF YOU AND BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THE POSITION
gm9xAQEhc44_23 0 WIDE BASE ARMS OUT ESTABLISH CONTACT LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY BALL COMES OFF YOU'RE AT LEAST TWO FEET AWAY FROM THE RIM ESTABLISH CONTACT FIRST THEN AGGRESSIVELY GET THE BASKETBALL
gm9xAQEhc44_24 0 IF YOU CAN BOX OUT IF YOU CAN REBOUND YOU CAN PLAY ON ANY TEAM
gm9xAQEhc44_25 0 I PROMISE YOU THAT

GlSrORY5Kak_1 0 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS ASTROLOGICAL PROFILES ASTROLOGICAL COMPATIBILITY CHARTS- EVERYBODY USES THEM
GlSrORY5Kak_2 0 THIS IS DR PAUL AUTHOR OF BOOMER GIRLS A BOOMER WOMEN'S GUIDE TO MEN AND DATING
GlSrORY5Kak_3 0 HOW DO YOU DETERMINE THE COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE
GlSrORY5Kak_4 0 MORE IMPORTANTLY YOU AND THE OTHER PERSON
GlSrORY5Kak_5 0 NUMBER ONE DO NOT LISTEN TO YOUR FRIENDS
GlSrORY5Kak_7 0 LITTLE STORY ABOUT THAT I'VE HAD WOMEN CALL WHO HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEIR GIRLFRIENDS REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THE GUY THAT THEY WERE WITH AND GUESS WHAT
GlSrORY5Kak_8 0 AFTER SHE STOPPED GOING WITH HIM THE GIRLFRIEND PICKED UP ON THE GUY
GlSrORY5Kak_9 0 SO DON'T ASK YOUR FRIENDS
GlSrORY5Kak_10 0 THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT HOW COMPATIBLE YOU ARE WITH ANOTHER PERSON BE YOU MALE OR FEMALE
GlSrORY5Kak_11 0 AND THAT'S THIS TRUST YOUR GUT FEELING
GlSrORY5Kak_12 0 TRUST THAT SIXTH SENSE
GlSrORY5Kak_13 0 ONLY YOU KNOW IF THE CHEMISTRY IS THERE
GlSrORY5Kak_14 0 YOU CAN USE EVERY PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE IN THE BOOK
GlSrORY5Kak_15 0 YOU CAN USE EVERY ASTROLOGICAL TEST
GlSrORY5Kak_16 0 YOU CAN USE EVERY SIGN THAT YOU WANT
GlSrORY5Kak_17 0 BUT THE FINAL ANSWER IS YOU
GlSrORY5Kak_18 0 HOW DO I FEEL ABOUT THIS PERSON
GlSrORY5Kak_19 0 AND YOU MIGHT ADD SOMETHING TO THAT HOW DOES THAT PERSON FEEL ABOUT ME
GlSrORY5Kak_20 0 ULTIMATELY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE THAT COMMUNICATION THAT CONVERSATION
GlSrORY5Kak_21 0 AND YOU CAN FEEL IT
GlSrORY5Kak_22 0 AND THAT'S THE BEST GUIDE
GlSrORY5Kak_23 0 TRYING TO DO IT THROUGH SOME OTHER SOURCE ANALYZING IT PUTTING IT THROUGH THE COMPUTER- IT DOESN'T WORK
GlSrORY5Kak_24 0 YOU HAVE TO MEET SOMEBODY FIRST OF COURSE
GlSrORY5Kak_25 0 BUT THE IMPORTANT IDEA IS HOW DO YOU FEEL AND HOW DO THEY FEEL
GlSrORY5Kak_26 0 IT'S FAIRLY SIMPLE
GlSrORY5Kak_27 0 THIS IS DR PAUL
GlSrORY5Kak_28 0 MAY YOUR FANTASIES OF TODAY BE YOUR REALITIES OF TOMORROW
hAPx94Mt964_1 0 ALRIGHT WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER OUTSIDE OF THE BODY SELF DEFENSE TECHNIQUES
hAPx94Mt964_2 0 THE REASON WE'RE SAYING OUTSIDE OF THE BODY WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT A SPECIFIC STRIKE
hAPx94Mt964_3 0 IT'S ACTUALLY THE POSITION YOU'RE GOING TO BE GOING INTO
hAPx94Mt964_4 0 SO WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT ROLE A DIFFERENT MINDSET WHEN WE'RE DOING SELF DEFENSE TECHNIQUES
hAPx94Mt964_5 0 WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT POSITIONS THEN WE ARE ABOUT THE STRIKES
hAPx94Mt964_6 0 SO FIRST OFF BEFORE WE EVEN STARTED WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT SAFETY AGAIN
hAPx94Mt964_7 0 PRACTICE ALL THESE TECHNIQUES NICE AND SLOW
hAPx94Mt964_8 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE GETTING SOMEBODY THAT IS A CONFIDENT TRAINING PARTNER THAT IS NOT GOING TO FREAK OUT ON YOU THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE FLINCHING EVERY TIME YOU THROW A STRIKE
hAPx94Mt964_9 0 YOU WANT SOMEONE THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU
hAPx94Mt964_10 0 IF YOU'RE AT A MARTIAL ARTS STUDIO OR IF YOU'RE JUST AT YOUR HOUSE IF YOU HAVE ANY FRIENDS TRY TO GO WITH EACH FRIEND AND TRY TO SEE WHO IS GOING TO BE THE BEST FIT FOR YOU
hAPx94Mt964_11 0 AND LIKEWISE FOR YOURSELF YOU WANT TO BE THE BEST TRAINING PARTNER POSSIBLE
hAPx94Mt964_12 0 SO THAT WAY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR TECHNIQUE
hAPx94Mt964_13 0 AND ALSO IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO IS WILLING TO GO THE EXTRA MILE WITH YOU YOU'LL ALSO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT NEW TECHNIQUES ON YOUR OWN
hAPx94Mt964_14 0 SO AGAIN SAFETY IS KEY

-GCHRcGT-44_7 0 YOU CAN MAKE A POINT TO POINT ROUTE AS A DAY OR A FEW DAYS
-GCHRcGT-44_8 0 THE OTHER OPTION IS YOU CAN DO A LOOP WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE ONE VEHICLE
-GCHRcGT-44_9 0 YOU LEAVE IT AT THE START AND YOU ARE GOING TO END UP RIGHT BACK THERE AT THE END

gdc_2uxB7_U_1 0 OKAY WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR HOLE IN YOUR POPSICLE YOU CAN THREAD IT WITH THE CORD
gdc_2uxB7_U_2 0 AND DO ABOUT A DOUBLED ARM'S LENGTH OF CORD
gdc_2uxB7_U_3 0 IF YOU MAKE IT TOO LONG IT'S VERY HARD TO WORK WITH
gdc_2uxB7_U_4 0 SO IT'S BETTER TO JUST DO A ABOUT A DOUBLES DOUBLE AN ARM'S LENGTH
gdc_2uxB7_U_5 0 AND THEN AND THEN YOU CAN JUST KEEP TYING ON NEW PIECES AS YOU GO
gdc_2uxB7_U_7 0 SO WHAT WE WILL DO IS WE WANT TO START FROM UNDERNEATH AND PUT THE POPSICLE STICK UNDER ONE OF THE BRAID PIECES AND PULL IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND TIE A KNOT

Ge0m7365dXk_1 0 HI I'M HUNTER FROM THE AUSTIN AQUA-DOME
Ge0m7365dXk_2 0 KEEPING YOUR AQUARIUM CLEAN IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF OWNING A FISH TANK
Ge0m7365dXk_3 0 THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS FOR DOING THIS ARE A SIPHON HOSE AND A BUCKET
Ge0m7365dXk_4 0 TO CLEAN THE AQUARIUM PUT THE END OF THE HOSE IN THE BUCKET DIP THE BELL OF THE SIPHON INTO THE WATER AND LIFT IT OUT LET THE WATER DRAIN DOWN AND DROP IT BACK IN THIS WILL START THE SIPHON
Ge0m7365dXk_5 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS GO ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK SUCKING DEBRIS OUT OF THE GRAVEL
Ge0m7365dXk_6 0 THE SIPHON IS ONLY STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL THE DIRT UP OUT OF THE GRAVEL LEAVING THE GRAVEL IN PLACE
Ge0m7365dXk_7 0 THE GOAL IS TO GO OVER THE ENTIRE BOTTOM OF THE TANK BEFORE THE WATER LEVEL DRAINS MORE THAN A THIRD TO A HALF WAY
Ge0m7365dXk_8 0 AFTER THAT YOU WANT TO DECHLORINATE THE TANK AND FILL IT BACK UP WITH FRESH WATER
Ge0m7365dXk_9 0 THE OTHER IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER WHEN DOING AQUARIUM MAINTENANCE IS TO EITHER RINSE OR REPLACE THE FILTER PADS IN YOUR MECHANICAL FILTER
H2CpqoUhiIw_1 0 NOW I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO INSTALL OUR LINING INTO OUR RECYCLED JEAN BAG
H2CpqoUhiIw_2 0 FIRST OPEN THE ZIPPER LIKE THIS
H2CpqoUhiIw_3 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT THAT LINING RIGHT INSIDE
H2CpqoUhiIw_5 0 NOW WE'LL START AT THE SIDE SEAMS
H2CpqoUhiIw_6 0 AND JUST KIND OF WE HAVE TWO INCHES HERE
H2CpqoUhiIw_7 0 WE'RE JUST GOING TO PLACE THAT SIDE ZIPPER ON THE SIDE SEAM
H2CpqoUhiIw_8 0 AND KIND OF HOLD IT IN PLACE AND THEN PIN IT ON THE OUTSIDE
H2CpqoUhiIw_9 0 I AM GOING TO BE SEWING MY LINING
H2CpqoUhiIw_10 0 YOU WANT TO FIRST CHOSE YOUR LINE OF WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO SEW THE LINING IN
H2CpqoUhiIw_11 0 I'M GOING TO SEW IT RIGHT ALONG THE UNDERNEATH THE EDGE OF THE WAISTBAND HERE
H2CpqoUhiIw_12 0 I'M GOING TO SEW RIGHT HERE
H2CpqoUhiIw_13 0 BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SEW UP OUR LITTLE POCKET ON THE OUTSIDE
H2CpqoUhiIw_14 0 SO MY SEAM LINE IS GOING TO BE RIGHT ALONG THE EDGE HERE
H2CpqoUhiIw_15 0 SO YOU WANT TO PIN THE SIDE
H2CpqoUhiIw_16 0 NOW I ALSO HAVE THE ZIPPER THE THICKNESS OF THE ZIPPER THAT I NEED TO SEW THROUGH
H2CpqoUhiIw_17 0 AND THE THICKNESS OF THE SIDE SEAM
H2CpqoUhiIw_18 0 SO I'VE JUST MOVED THE ZIPPER PART OVER A LITTLE SO I'M NOT I DON'T HAVE THE ZIPPER THICKNESS AND THE SIDE SEAM THICKNESS TO SEW OVER ALL AT ONCE
H2CpqoUhiIw_19 0 ITS JUST SLIGHTLY MOVED OVER SO THAT I CAN SEW OVER BOTH OF THOSE THICKNESSES
H2CpqoUhiIw_20 0 SO WHEN YOU GET THIS SIDE IN NOW SEE YOU HAVE ABOUT A TWO INCH OVERHANG THERE
H2CpqoUhiIw_21 0 NOW WE'LL DO THE SAME ON THIS SIDE SEAM
H2CpqoUhiIw_22 0 AND WE'LL PIN THAT FIND YOUR SEWING LINE RIGHT THERE IN THE CENTER
H2CpqoUhiIw_23 0 AND THEN PIN THAT SIDE IN
H2CpqoUhiIw_24 0 ALL RIGHT SO NOW WE HAVE THOSE
H2CpqoUhiIw_25 0 NOW YOU JUST WANT TO TAKE YOUR HAND AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU WANT TO HAVE ABOUT A TWO INCH SPACE HERE FROM THE ZIPPER TO THE EDGE
H2CpqoUhiIw_26 0 TO WHERE YOU'RE SEWING IT
H2CpqoUhiIw_27 0 AND JUST KIND OF PUT YOUR FINGERS IN THERE ABOUT TWO INCHES AND THEN ON THEN HOLD THAT LIKE THAT
H2CpqoUhiIw_28 0 AND PUT A PIN RIGHT ON YOUR SEWING LINE
H2CpqoUhiIw_29 0 AND MOVE DOWN AND DO THE SAME THING
H2CpqoUhiIw_30 0 AND JUST PIN THIS LINING IN ALL THE WAY AROUND THE SAME WAY
HFdsk3MZcnk_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS ORESTES GUADA FROM EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE GAME OF PAINTBALL
HFdsk3MZcnk_2 0 THE RULES ON THE GAME HOW IT'S PLAYED IS THEY DIVIDE IT THEY WILL DIVIDE IT AND IT'LL BE ELIMINATION
HFdsk3MZcnk_3 0 YOU WOULD HAVE TO SHOOT EVERYBODY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TEAM
HFdsk3MZcnk_4 0 IF YOU ELIMINATE EVERYBODY THE OTHER TEAM WINS IF YOU DON'T IT'LL BE TIED UP OR TIME WILL RUN OUT
HFdsk3MZcnk_5 0 THERE'S ALWAYS TIME BECAUSE THEN GAMES TAKE TOO LONG
HFdsk3MZcnk_6 0 THERE IS PROFESSIONAL PAINTBALL IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY CAUSE NOW THEY HAVE FLAGS
HFdsk3MZcnk_7 0 IT'S SEVEN ON SEVEN YOU SHOOT EVERYBODY AND THEN YOU GOT TO GRAB THEIR FLAG AND PUT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN THERE'S RECREATIONAL PAINTBALL WHICH IS JUST LIKE FAMILIES COMING OUT HERE SHOOTING EACH UP THEY CAN PLAY CAPTURE THE FLAG AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT IT'S MAINLY ELIMINATION
-gwTchCnaQg_1 0 ALRIGHT THE FIRST MOVEMENT WE LIKE TO DO IN OUR STANDING SERIES I LIKE TO CALL APPLE PICKING

-gwTchCnaQg_3 0 WE'LL DO A BIG INHALE THROUGH THE RIBS EXHALE RIBS GO DOWN
-gwTchCnaQg_4 0 AND YOU ARE GOING TO EXTEND ONE ARM HERE I'M DOING MY RIGHT ARM AND THE RIBS ARE GOING TO EXPAND AND LIFT THROUGH THE RIGHT SIDE AS IF I HAVE AN APPLE IN A TREE AND I'M REACHING TO PICK IT
-gwTchCnaQg_5 0 I EXPAND A LITTLE MORE AND I START PUSHING OFF WITH THE LEFT FOOT AS I START PUSHING OFF WITH THE LEFT FOOT I'M GOING TO REACH A LITTLE FURTHER

H1-j6LC90bg_1 0 SO EACH DIE EACH ONE OF THE DICE IN THE GAME OF TRAIN IS SIX-SIDED AND THERE ARE SIX DICE
H1-j6LC90bg_2 0 NOW I'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW EACH ONE EACH SIDE HAS A PARTICULAR PART OF A TRAIN ON IT
H1-j6LC90bg_3 0 EACH SIDE OF THE DICE HAS A PARTICULAR NUMBER ON IT TOO A CORRESPONDING NUMBER
H1-j6LC90bg_4 0 AND THESE ARE POINTS VALUES
H1-j6LC90bg_5 0 THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS GAME IS THAT NUMBERS SIX AND FIVE DO NOT ACTUALLY SCORE POINTS
H1-j6LC90bg_6 0 BUT THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN NUMBERS TO EXPLAIN WHERE THEY GO IN THE SEQUENCE
H1-j6LC90bg_7 0 SIX IS THE ENGINE THE HEAD OF THE TRAIN
H1-j6LC90bg_8 0 FIVE IS THE COAL TENDER WHICH ALWAYS GOES WITH AN ENGINE
H1-j6LC90bg_9 0 AND THEN FOUR IS ONE OF THE CARGO CARS AND THIS IS WORTH POINTS
H1-j6LC90bg_10 0 YOU NOTE THAT ONCE THE COLORS GETS INVOLVED INSTEAD OF BLACK AND WHITE DICE WE HAVE COLORS
H1-j6LC90bg_11 0 IF IT'S GOT A COLOR ON THE SIDE THEN IT SCORES POINTS
H1-j6LC90bg_12 0 SO THERE'S FOUR POINTS
H1-j6LC90bg_13 0 THERE IS THREE TWO AND THEN THE CABOOSE IS WORTH ONE
H1-j6LC90bg_14 0 THE CABOOSE IS KIND OF NEAT BECAUSE IT ALSO IF YOU ARE ABLE TO PUT A CABOOSE ON YOUR TRAIN YOU DOUBLE YOUR SCORE
H1-j6LC90bg_15 0 SO THOSE ARE THE POINTS VALUES FOR THE TRAIN DICE

gk_Axbx0HIU_6 0 YOU CAN SUPPORT THESE BY TAKING SHOE LACES SPARE TWINE THERE'S VINES YOU CAN TAKE AND TIE EACH OF THESE INDIVIDUALLY
gk_Axbx0HIU_7 0 YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THE ONES GOING FROM THE GROUND TO THE SUPPORT BEAM ONCE YOU GOT THOSE YOU GOING TO WANT TO TRY AND CROSS HATCH SOME AND PUT SOME OTHERS RUNNING THE OPPOSITE WAY AND THIS WILL GIVE YOUR SHELTER SOME MORE SUPPORT FOR LAYING COVER THE ON IT TO WHERE IT SUPPORTS IT BETTER AND IT'S A MUCH STRONGER STURDIER SHELTER
gk_Axbx0HIU_8 0 AND THIS IS HOW TO SELECT AND PLACE THIS PORCH SIX FOR BUILDING A LEAN TO SHELTER
H4onp2hk--k_1 0 HI I'M MELODY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
H4onp2hk--k_2 0 I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SUPPLIES THE THINGS YOU'D NEED TO HAVE OR WANT TO AT LEAST HAVE TO TRY AND START DRAWING IN PASTEL
H4onp2hk--k_3 0 ALL RIGHT THERE ARE THE DIFFERENT KINDS THAT WE HAVE DESCRIBED THROUGHOUT SEVERAL OF OUR SEGMENTS
H4onp2hk--k_4 0 THERE ARE THE BLOCK STYLE THAT ARE MORE LIKE CHALK THIS IS THE SAME THING ONLY ANOTHER VERSION WITH ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS COLORS
H4onp2hk--k_5 0 THERE IS THE OIL BASED PASTEL WHICH IS A LOT OF FUN AND IT BLENDS EITHER WITH Q-TIPS OR ACTUALLY I'VE TRIED IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PAINT REMOVER LACQUER THINNER AND ITS AN INTERESTING PROCESS BUT I THINK JUST TO KEEP THE SMELLS DOWN AND JUST TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN JUST TRY BLENDING IT FIRST WITH THE PROFESSIONAL Q-TIP OR THE NUBS THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER AND I'LL EXPLAIN THOSE TO YOU IN JUST A MINUTE
H4onp2hk--k_6 0 WE ALSO HAVE THE PASTELS THAT ACTUALLY COME IN A PENCIL FORM YOU SHARPEN THESE WITH A REAL PENCIL SHARPENER A FAT ONE FOR ART PENCILS BECAUSE AS YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT FATTER THAN REGULAR PENCILS AND THIS IS THE CLEANEST WAY TO GO
H4onp2hk--k_7 0 I THINK SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE FOLLOWED US THROUGH OUR SEGMENTS TO SEE JUST HOW DIRTY MY FINGERS DID GET WITH THESE BUT I SURE DID HAVE A LOT OF FUN DOING IT
H4onp2hk--k_8 0 NOW THESE YOU CAN BUY THESE AT MOST CRAFT AND ART SUPPLY STORES AND BASICALLY ITS TIGHTLY WOUND VERY VERY DENSE PAPER AND AS THEY GET OLD THEY DO GET A LITTLE BIT ROUNDER AND YOU CAN PEEL THEM AND PULL THE PAPER OFF AND THEN TEAR IT AND THEN IT WILL BE SHARPER AGAIN
H4onp2hk--k_9 0 THEY'RE NOT VERY EXPENSIVE AND THEY'RE EASY TO USE
H4onp2hk--k_10 0 FOR COMPOSITION YOU'LL PROBABLY WANT A RULER POSSIBLY A COMPASS AND IN OUR NEXT SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE KINDS OF PAPER THAT YOU WOULD USE FOR THIS TYPE OF PROJECT
GRbQNAIOI80_1 0 THE NEXT THING THAT WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH IS THE INTONATION ON THIS PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT
GRbQNAIOI80_2 0 AND WE WILL HAVE TO USE OUR CHROMATIC TUNER
GRbQNAIOI80_3 0 OR YOU CAN USE A STROBE TUNER OF SOME KIND IN ORDER TO GET AN ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF WHETHER OR NOT THE PITCH OF AN OPEN STRING AND THE PITCH AT THE TWELFTH HARMONIC AT THE OCTAVE IS THE SAME
GRbQNAIOI80_4 0 AND WHETHER THAT PITCH SHIFTS WHEN WE PRESS THE STRING DOWN AND STRETCH IT
GRbQNAIOI80_5 0 SO THAT'S WHAT INTONATION'S ALL ABOUT
GRbQNAIOI80_6 0 AND THE WAY TO ADJUST THAT INTONATION IS WE MAY HAVE TO ADJUST THE CROWN OF THE SADDLE
GRbQNAIOI80_7 0 WE MIGHT HAVE TO ADJUST THE ANGLE OF THE SADDLE
GRbQNAIOI80_8 0 OR IF YOU LOOK ON THIS INSTRUMENT YOU CAN SEE THEY HAVE BUILT IN SOME INTONATION BY EVEN SHIFTING WHERE THE CROWN OF THAT SADDLE EXISTS ON THE E STRING
GRbQNAIOI80_9 0 IT'S ON THIS END AND ON THE B STRING IT'S ON THIS END
GRbQNAIOI80_10 0 SO IT'S ADJUSTING THE DISTANCE OR THE LENGTH OF THE STRING WITH SADDLE ADJUSTMENTS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PITCH OF THOSE THREE THINGS OPEN STRING OCTAVE HARMONIC AND PLAYED NOTE ARE ALL EXACTLY THE SAME
g8ujePz4CCg_1 0 NOW WHAT'S NEXT IS THE PEAK LED
g8ujePz4CCg_2 0 THE PEAK LED BASICALLY WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO PEAK IN YOUR SONG BASICALLY WHAT'S CLIPPING AND WHAT'S OVER THE THRESHOLD OF ZERO
g8ujePz4CCg_3 0 NOW WHEN USING THE CONTROL 24 YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT THERE'S METERS AT THE VERY TOP
g8ujePz4CCg_4 0 WHAT HAPPENS IS THERE'S A RED METER AT THE VERY TOP AND WHENEVER THIS GETS HIT IT STAYS ON
g8ujePz4CCg_5 0 YOU CAN ALSO CLEAR IT BY PRESSING THIS CLEAR PEAK SPOT BUTTON ON THE LEFT SIDE
g8ujePz4CCg_6 0 NOW WHEN YOU HAVE THIS BUTTON RIGHT HERE WHEN YOU CLEAR IT IT'S GOING TO GET RID OF IT
g8ujePz4CCg_7 0 AS SOON AS IT PEAKS UP AGAIN IT'S GOING TO SHOW THAT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING THIS IS DISTORTING SO DON'T YOU DON'T REALLY WANT ANYTHING TO DISTORT
g8ujePz4CCg_8 0 IT ALSO WILL SHOW YOU RIGHT HERE WITHIN YOUR INPUT AND YOUR MICS SO WHEN YOU'RE RECORDING SOMETHING AND YOU CHOOSE TO TURN ON YOUR MIC RIGHT
g8ujePz4CCg_9 0 BY HITTING THE SOURCE BUTTON YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T PEAK ON THE WAY IN AND THAT IT'S NOT PEAKING AFTER AS WELL
g8ujePz4CCg_10 0 SO WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PEAK DOESN'T GO ON AND THAT THESE NEVER REACH RED
g8e9FZQWkMM_1 0 WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR OUR VEGETABLE STOCK TO HEAT UP WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TURN UP OUR BACK BURNER TO ABOUT EIGHT
g8e9FZQWkMM_2 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO POUR A TABLESPOON OF OIL IN OUR LARGE POT SO WE'LL MOVE OUR OIL AROUND SO THAT IT COVERS ALL OF THE BOTTOM OF OUR POT
g8e9FZQWkMM_3 0 WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR THAT TO HEAT WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK TO OUR VEGETABLE STOCK
g8e9FZQWkMM_4 0 THERE ARE STILL BITS I CAN SEE THEM FLOATING AROUND IN THERE AND WE WANT TO BREAK THOSE UP AS MUCH AS WE CAN
g8e9FZQWkMM_5 0 ALRIGHT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR 1/2 CUP OF RICE AND WE'RE GOING TO DUMP IT DOWN HERE IN THE BOTTOM OF OUR PAN
g8e9FZQWkMM_6 0 WE'RE GOING TO JUST SMOOTH IT AROUND SO THERE'S EQUAL ALL OVER THE BOTTOM
g8e9FZQWkMM_7 0 AND ONCE OUR VEGETABLE STOCK IS HOT WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MEASURE OUT ONE CUP WE'RE GOING TO POUR IT IN WITH OUR RICE
g8e9FZQWkMM_8 0 WHEN THIS COMES TO A BOIL WE'RE GOING TO PUT ON OUR TOP AND REDUCE OUR HEAT DOWN TO FOUR AND LET IT COOK UNTIL THE VEGETABLE STOCK HAS JUST ABOUT ALL EVAPORATED
H0-wO7ShPGw_1 0 HEY BOBBY LAREW HERE I AM YOUR EXPERT ON DIVING WE HAVE KICKED OUT OF OUR DIVE WE ARE ABOUT TO ENTER THE WATER WHAT DO WE DO TO MAKE SURE WE DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF SPLASH GOING ON
H0-wO7ShPGw_2 0 WHAT DO WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HITTING VERTICAL
H0-wO7ShPGw_3 0 WHAT DO YOU DO TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A GOOD BODY LINE
H0-wO7ShPGw_4 0 IF YOU ARE A COMPETITIVE DIVER WHAT DO YOU GOT TO DO TO MAKE SURE YOU GET THE HIGHEST SCORE POSSIBLE
H0-wO7ShPGw_5 0 OKAY SO HOW DO WE ENTER THE WATER
H0-wO7ShPGw_6 0 THAT IS WHAT I AM GOING TO TEACH YOU RIGHT NOW I AM GOING TO GET BACK DOWN ON THE GROUND FOR YOU
H0-wO7ShPGw_7 0 WE HAVE KICKED OUT OF OUR DIVE WHEN YOU ARE ENTERING THE WATER FEET SHOULD BE POINTED AS FAR DOWN AS POSSIBLE ALMOST AS IF YOU ARE TRYING TO CURL YOUR TOES UNDERNEATH ALRIGHT KNEES ARE TOGETHER AND LOCKED OUT STRAIGHT OKAY
H0-wO7ShPGw_8 0 THERE SHOULD BE NO VISIBLE ARCH IN YOUR BODY OKAY WHAT I AM DOING RIGHT NOW IS ARCHING THERE SHOULD BE NO VISIBLE ARCH IN YOUR BODY WHEN YOU ARE ENTERING THE WATER
H0-wO7ShPGw_9 0 THE TRICK TO DO THAT IS TO THINK ABOUT TAKING YOUR BELLY BUTTON AND TRYING TO SUCK IT THROUGH YOUR BODY TO YOUR BACK
H0-wO7ShPGw_10 0 THAT WILL HELP KEEP YOUR BACK STRAIGHT
H0-wO7ShPGw_11 0 ANOTHER THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO TAKE YOUR HIPS AND ROLL THEM UP A LITTLE BIT OKAY UPPER BODY ARMS EXTENDED OVER YOUR HEAD HANDS TOGETHER EYES LOOKING AT THE HAND
H0-wO7ShPGw_12 0 THIS IS THE PROPER WAY TO ENTER THE WATER
Gkjo_HGLNs4_1 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BANK SHOTS
Gkjo_HGLNs4_2 0 BANK SHOTS ARE NOT ONLY PRETTY BUT THEY'RE EFFECTIVE AND THEY'RE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE SHOT WHEN YOU USE THEM PROPERLY THAN JUST SHOOTING THE BALL AT THE RIM
Gkjo_HGLNs4_3 0 AND THAT'S WHY THEY PUT THE WHITE LINES UP THERE
Gkjo_HGLNs4_4 0 TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO AIM AT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_5 0 THEY'RE NOT UP THERE BY ACCIDENT THEY'RE UP THERE FOR A REASON
Gkjo_HGLNs4_6 0 IT'S ALMOST IF YOU LIKEN IT TO POOL IT'S ALL TRAJECTORY AND GEOMETRY
Gkjo_HGLNs4_7 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO UNDERSTAND ANY OF THAT YOU JUST HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU'RE IN A CERTAIN POSITION AND YOU PUT THE BALL UP THERE OFF OF THE GLASS IT'S GOING TO COME IN AND BOUNCE INTO THE RIM
Gkjo_HGLNs4_8 0 THAT'S THE BENEFIT OF USING A BACKBOARD SHOT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_9 0 YOU CAN USE IT FROM ALMOST ANYWHERE ON THE FLOOR
Gkjo_HGLNs4_10 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IF YOU'RE OUTSIDE OF THE LANE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE LANE WHEN YOU'RE UP MORE TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE KEY YOU DON'T WANT TO USE THE BACKBOARD SHOT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_11 0 THOSE ARE CALLED BANK SHOTS OFF OF THE FRONT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_12 0 YOU JUST DON'T REALLY WANT TO USE THAT THAT'S NOT AS EFFECTIVE
Gkjo_HGLNs4_13 0 IT'S REALLY MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN YOU'RE USING IT ON THE SIDE OF THE COURT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_14 0 AND JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA AND THIS TAKES PRACTICE
Gkjo_HGLNs4_15 0 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COME OUT HERE AND MAYBE I'LL MISS MY FIRST ONE BUT YOU'VE GOT TO JUST KEEP PRACTICING AND PRACTICING TO REALLY GET AN IDEA OF WHERE YOU WANT TO HIT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_16 0 SEE AND I MISSED MY SHOT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_17 0 SO YOU KEEP PRACTICING YOU CAN START IN CLOSER AND USE THAT BACKBOARD
Gkjo_HGLNs4_18 0 AND THAT'S A GOOD STRATEGY TO SHOOT TWENTY FIFTY 100 200 SHOTS FROM THIS SIDE USING THE BACKBOARD UNTIL YOU GET USED TO IT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_19 0 KEEP SHOOTING AND USING THAT BACKBOARD AND THEN STEP BACK ONE MORE STEP AND SHOOT AND YOU'LL GET USED TO IT AND YOU'LL BE AN EXPERT WITH A GREAT LOOKING SHOT IN NO TIME
G83jhoKfrvo_2 0 MY NAME IS JAN CUNI
G83jhoKfrvo_3 0 I'M A PROFESSIONAL HAIRSTYLIST AND HAIR COLORIST

G83jhoKfrvo_6 0 BEFORE YOU ADD COLOR
G83jhoKfrvo_7 0 YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TO GO GET A COLOR OR HIGHLIGHT DONE DO NOT WASH YOUR HAIR BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE NATURAL MOIST IN YOUR HAIR AND THAT IS GOOD BECAUSE IT'S HELPING YOUR HAIR GET PROTECTED FROM THE CHEMICALS
G6RqcJ7rSKY_1 0 WITH CALF RAISES WE WANT TO WORK THE LOWER PART BELOW THE KNEE INTO THE ACHILLES THAT POINT OF ATTACHMENT TO THE HEEL
G6RqcJ7rSKY_2 0 WITH YOUR WEIGHTS YOUR FREE WEIGHTS HANGING RIGHT DOWN BY YOUR SIDE OR AN OPTION WOULD BE TO PLACE THEM ON THE MIDI PART OF THE SHOULDER RESTING LIGHTLY ON TOP
G6RqcJ7rSKY_3 0 YOU WANT TO SLIGHT BENDING THE KNEES FEET HIP WIDTH APART AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP TO THAT BALL OF YOUR FOOT WITHOUT LETTING GRAVITY PULL YOU FORWARD

G6RqcJ7rSKY_5 0 CONTRACT AND RELEASE THE CALVES SLOW BALLISTIC MOVEMENT WE CAN DO ON A QUICK AND HOLD AND RELEASE WITH A PULSE OR YOU CAN JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE CONTRACTING RELEASE
G6RqcJ7rSKY_6 0 AGAIN MAKING SURE YOU STAY BACK BEHIND THE TOES YOU WANT THE WORK LOAD TO BE IN THE CALVES GASTRONEMIUS NOT IN THE TOES AND RELEASE
G6RqcJ7rSKY_7 0 WORKING TEN TO FIFTEEN REPS ONE TO THREE SETS
h5-xMqT_n24_1 0 HI I'M LISA GOLDSWORTHY WITH ACE CARPET AND UPHOLSTERY CARE AND IN THIS SEGMENT I'M GOING TO DISCUSS THE POTTED PLANTS SPILL
h5-xMqT_n24_2 0 THE BEST THING TO DO WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS TO VACUUM IT AND WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND WOULD BE TO TAKE THE THE UPHOLSTERY CLEANING PART OF OF THAT
h5-xMqT_n24_3 0 AND THE REASON WHY I HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING THE UPHOLSTERY TOOL OF A VACUUM VERSUS THE BEATER BRUSH IS THAT WE WANT TO TACKLE WE WANT TO EXTRACT THE LOOSE SOIL
h5-xMqT_n24_4 0 AND OUR BEATER BAR ON THE VACUUM MAY MAY ACTUALLY EMBED THE SOIL FURTHER BECAUSE IT'S DOING ITS JOB
h5-xMqT_n24_5 0 IT'S TRYING TO LOOSEN DIRT BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I'M USING A LITTLE BIT OF A DAMP SOIL BECAUSE OFTENTIMES WHEN WE'RE POTTING OUR PLANTS YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE HAVE A LITTLE WATER IN THERE TOO
h5-xMqT_n24_6 0 SO WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE MUD
h5-xMqT_n24_7 0 WE WANT TO EXTRACT THE LOOSE SOIL SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND DO STEP NUMBER ONE VACUUM
h5-xMqT_n24_8 0 NOW IN THAT VACUUMING PROCESS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT I WAS TAKING THE CUP AND JUST PLACING IT ON THE SURFACE VERSUS SCRUBBING NEVER SCRUB
h5-xMqT_n24_9 0 SO JUST LET IT SIT THERE
h5-xMqT_n24_10 0 GET AS MUCH LOOSE SOIL UP AS YOU CAN ON THAT SAMPLE
gEiZVZqjGOk_1 0 HI I'M AMELIA AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT HIGHLIGHTING AT HOME
gEiZVZqjGOk_2 0 SO LET'S SAY YOU GET A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH BLONDE IN ONE SPOT
gEiZVZqjGOk_3 0 WHAT DO YOU DO
gEiZVZqjGOk_4 0 WELL THE EASIEST WAY TO FIX IT WOULD BE TO GO BACK TO THE STORE AND GET A SEMI-PERMANENT OR DEPOSIT-ONLY COLOR A SHADE OR TWO DARKER THAN THE BLONDE YOU'VE GOT IN THERE NOW
gEiZVZqjGOk_5 0 I WOULD TRY AND STICK WITH A MEDIUM GOLDEN SHADE BECAUSE IF YOU DO TOO ASH IT MAY COME UP GREEN IF YOU DO TOO WARM IT MAY COME UP A LITTLE BRASSIE
gEiZVZqjGOk_6 0 SO JUST LIKE A NICE NEUTRAL OR BEIGE SLIGHT GOLD THAT'S ABOUT AS WARM AS I WOULD GET
gEiZVZqjGOk_7 0 I WOULD MIX IT UP AND I WOULD ACTUALLY HAND APPLY
gEiZVZqjGOk_8 0 I WOULDN'T PULL IT THROUGH THE CAP OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
gEiZVZqjGOk_9 0 I WOULD TAKE MY MASCARA WAND OR MY FINGER OR A BRUSH AND I WOULD JUST FIGURE OUT WHERE I DIDN'T WANT THE HIGHLIGHTS TO BE ANYMORE AND I WOULD APPLY THE COLOR THERE
gEiZVZqjGOk_10 0 LET IT PROCESS AND THEN SHAMPOO IT OUT AND NOW YOU'LL HAVE IMMEDIATELY ADDED SOME LOWLIGHTS
gQqJ18e0Uc0_1 0 HI THIS IS MIKE LOPEZ WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
gQqJ18e0Uc0_2 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING MAGIC THE GATHERING THE CARD GAME

gQqJ18e0Uc0_7 0 ON MOST OF THESE CARDS IT WILL TELL YOU WHAT THESE ABILITIES MEAN
gQqJ18e0Uc0_8 0 WHICH IS JUST USUALLY OFF OF THE BASIC BLOCK BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE EXPANSION CARDS THEY AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THESE CARDS ABILITIES MEAN
gQqJ18e0Uc0_9 0 DOWN HERE WE HAVE A QUOTE FROM THE BOOK AND STORYLINE OF MAGIC THE GATHERING
gQqJ18e0Uc0_10 0 AND OVER WE HAVE SINCE THIS IS A CREATURE CARD A SMALL BLOCK THAT HAS NUMBERS IN IT
gQqJ18e0Uc0_11 0 THE RIGHT HAND NUMBER IS THE CREATURE'S TOUGHNESS
gQqJ18e0Uc0_12 0 THIS TOUGHNESS IS A FOUR WHICH MEANS HE CAN SUSTAIN UP TO FOUR DAMAGE BEFORE DYING
gQqJ18e0Uc0_13 0 YOU COUNT DAMAGE DOWN SO IF FOUR ARE DEALT TO HIM THEN HE WOULD DIE
gQqJ18e0Uc0_14 0 IF THREE OR LESS WERE DEALT TO HIM HE WOULD LIVE
gQqJ18e0Uc0_15 0 NOW ON THE OTHER SIDE WE HAVE HIS STRENGTH OR POWER DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU WANT TO CALL IT
gQqJ18e0Uc0_16 0 IT'S ALSO A FOUR WHICH MEANS HE DEALS FOUR DAMAGE TO THE PERSON HE ATTACKS OR A CREATURE THAT BLOCKS HIM
gQqJ18e0Uc0_17 0 DOWN HERE IN THE BOTTOM LEFT HAND CORNER
gQqJ18e0Uc0_18 0 YOU WILL USUALLY SEE A LITTLE ARTIST'S BRUSH AND A PERSON'S NAME
gQqJ18e0Uc0_19 0 THIS IS THE ARTIST THAT PAINTED THE PICTURE THAT IS ON THE CARD
gQqJ18e0Uc0_20 0 THIS ARTIST CHANGES BETWEEN VARIOUS SETS AND EVEN CHANGES IN-BETWEEN SETS
gQqJ18e0Uc0_21 0 YOU WILL ALSO SEE THE COPYRIGHT INFORMATION FROM WIZARDS OF THE COAST FOR THE MAGIC AND THE EXPANSION THAT YOU ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING
gQqJ18e0Uc0_22 0 AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE COPYRIGHT INFORMATION AND THE WIZARDS OF THE COAST INC YOU WILL FIND A COUPLE MORE NUMBERS
gQqJ18e0Uc0_23 0 THE FIRST NUMBER THAT YOU COME ACROSS FROM RIGHT TO LEFT IS THE CARD STAPLE NUMBER
gQqJ18e0Uc0_24 0 AFTER THE SLASH IS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CARDS IN THIS BLOCK OR EXPANSION BLOCK
gQqJ18e0Uc0_25 0 SO AS YOU CAN SEE THIS CARD IS 39 OUT OF 383
h2VKacwXr_w_1 0 HELLO WELCOME MY NAME IS JULIO NUTT AND I'M A MASTER INSTRUCTOR OF THE JIM MCCLEAN GOLF SCHOOL IN MIAMI FLORIDA
h2VKacwXr_w_2 0 IN THIS CLIP I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT BAG
h2VKacwXr_w_3 0 THIS IS A GREAT TOOL FOR GOLFERS TO DEVELOP THE GOOD HABIT OF A CORRECT AND A GOOD IMPACT POSITION
h2VKacwXr_w_4 0 MANY TIMES WE SEE AMATEURS JUST HITTING UP ON THE BALL AND HITTING WHERE THE CLUB FACE IS AHEAD OF THE HANDS AND THE WEIGHT REMAINS INTO YOUR BACK LEG YOUR RIGHT LEG FOR RIGHT HANDED PLAYERS
h2VKacwXr_w_5 0 THIS IMPACT BAG IS REALLY GOING TO TEACH YOU THE HABIT OF COMING TO THE CORRECT IMPACT POSITION AND IF YOU NOTICE HERE MY WEIGHT IS WAILING TO MY LEFT SIDE THE CLUB FACE IS BEHIND MY HANDS SO MY HANDS ARE HEAD AND IN THIS POSITION I AM ABLE TO HIT DOWN ON THE BALL
h2VKacwXr_w_6 0 AS YOU REPEAT THIS EXERCISE AND COME HERE YOUR MUSCLE MEMORY IS GOING TO START DEVELOPING THE HABIT OF HITTING DOWN AND KEEPING THE HANDS AHEAD OF THE CLUB AND IS GOING TO HELP YOU GET A MUCH BETTER CONTACT WITH THE GOLF BALL
h2VKacwXr_w_7 0 THIS IS JULIO NUTT AT THE JIM MCCLEAN GOLF SCHOOL
hg0PYALmd64_1 0 OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON DRAWING THE SIX IRON
hg0PYALmd64_2 0 SO A DRAW ONCE AGAIN IS TAKING THE BALL FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
hg0PYALmd64_3 0 IT'S A WAY OF AVOIDING A LOT OF TROUBLES IN YOUR WAY AND ALSO GETTING THE BALL IF THE GREEN IS HEAVILY BUNKERED AND THE PIN'S ON THE LEFT SIDE THIS IS A WAY OF TRACKING THE BALL TOWARD THE PIN
hg0PYALmd64_4 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NOW THAT WE'RE GETTING INTO LONGER IRONS AND THEY'RE NOT QUITE AS LOFTED YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GENERATE MORE SIDE SPIN ON IT
hg0PYALmd64_5 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE NORMAL UNDER SPIN OF STRIKING A BALL BUT WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE THE FACE LIKE THIS TO CREATE SOME SIDE SPIN SO THE BALL WILL SPIN AND GO TO THE LEFT
hg0PYALmd64_6 0 SO IT'S GOING TO GET EASIER AND EASIER TO HOOK THE BALL
hg0PYALmd64_7 0 SO WE WANT TO WE WANT IT TO BE A DRAW NOT A HOOK SO WE CAN CONTROL IT
hg0PYALmd64_8 0 SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS THIS IS HOW YOU LINE UP FOR THE NORMAL STRAIGHT BALL
hg0PYALmd64_9 0 AND I'M GOING TO AIM MORE TO THE LEFT
hg0PYALmd64_10 0 SO I ROTATE A LITTLE OVER AND THEN I CLOSE THE CLUB FACE AND THEN I SWING NORMAL
hg0PYALmd64_11 0 NOW REMEMBER YOU'RE GOING TO HIT A LITTLE EXTRA DISTANCE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU DRAW THE BALL
hg0PYALmd64_12 0 SO ACCOUNT FOR THAT IN YOUR CLUB SELECTION
hg0PYALmd64_13 0 BUT THIS IS THE SIX IRON NOW LET'S SEE HOW THIS GOES
hg0PYALmd64_14 0 OKAY NOT TOO BAD
hg0PYALmd64_15 0 SO THE DRAW KEPT ME OUT OF A LOT OF TROUBLE
hg0PYALmd64_16 0 SO THE IDEA HERE IS WHEN YOU PRACTICE THIS SHOT A LOT YOU'LL REALLY AFTER A WHILE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET TO WHERE YOU CAN HIT IT VERY ACCURATELY AND YOU'LL SAVE YOURSELF THAT OCCASIONAL BLOW UP BAD HOLE OR YOU'LL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO SCORE A BETTER SCORE BECAUSE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO USE THIS NEW WEAPON IN YOUR ARSENAL
hbWcBFxRsjI_2 0 RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT A REASONS MIXER AND ACTUALLY REASON HAS TWO MIXERS BUT I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW YOU THE LARGER 14-CHANNEL MIXER AND SOME OF THE PARAMETERS THAT YOU'LL FIND ON THIS MIXER O.K
hbWcBFxRsjI_3 0 RIGHT NOW YOU'RE SEEING THE LARGER 14-CHANNEL MIXER THAT YOU'LL FIND IN REASON
hbWcBFxRsjI_5 0 EACH CHANNEL IS DESIGNATED WITH A NUMBER O.K
hbWcBFxRsjI_6 0 AND YOU'LL FIND THE NUMBER RIGHT IN THIS AREA O.K
hbWcBFxRsjI_7 0 AND EACH CHANNEL IS NUMBERED AND IT GOES ALL THE WAY UP TO FOURTEEN
hbWcBFxRsjI_9 0 YOU'LL ALSO FIND THAT EACH CHANNEL IS SPLIT INTO THREE DIFFERENT PARTS O.K
hbWcBFxRsjI_10 0 AND I'LL EXPLAIN THESE THREE DIFFERENT PARTS IN JUST A MOMENT
hbWcBFxRsjI_11 0 YOU ALSO HAVE YOUR MASTER CHANNEL WHICH ALSO HAS YOUR MASTER FADER WHICH YOU'LL BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE VOLUME OF THE WHOLE MIX OF YOUR SONG OR PROJECT
hbWcBFxRsjI_13 0 ALSO UP HERE YOU'LL HAVE YOUR MAIN AUXILIARY INPUTS HERE O.K
hbWcBFxRsjI_14 0 AND IN THE NEXT PARTS I'LL JUST EXPLAIN EACH PART OF A CHANNEL AND WHAT THEY DO
gb3dLfgPH0I_1 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO ERASE THIS LINE THEN YOU WANT TO THINK IN TERMS OF NOT PRESSING DOWN TOO HARD
gb3dLfgPH0I_2 0 NOW OKAY I ADMIT IT
gb3dLfgPH0I_3 0 I DO USE RULERS SOMETIMES
gb3dLfgPH0I_4 0 BUT RULERS COME INTO PLAY WHEN YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT THE SIZE OF SOMETHING
gb3dLfgPH0I_5 0 THEY'RE NOT GOING TO COME INTO PLAY WHEN YOU'RE THINKING IN TERMS OF LETTER SIZES OR HOW LONG A WORD IS GOING TO BE BECAUSE THAT'S TAKING YOU WAY INTO THE DIGITAL SIDE OF YOUR BRAIN AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THERE
gb3dLfgPH0I_6 0 OKAY SO LET'S SAY THAT I HAVE A PIECE THAT NEEDS TO BE LET'S SAY TEN INCHES
gb3dLfgPH0I_7 0 AND I KNOW THAT I WANT TO LEAVE A MARGIN OF AN INCH
gb3dLfgPH0I_8 0 SO I'LL LEAVE A MARGIN OF AN INCH ON EITHER SIDE
gb3dLfgPH0I_9 0 AND THAT'S HOW WIDE I KNOW MY PIECE IS GOING TO BE
gb3dLfgPH0I_10 0 AND THEN WHAT I NEED IS A TRIANGLE
gb3dLfgPH0I_11 0 AND I HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT TRIANGLES BUT HERE'S YOUR BASIC TRIANGLE
gb3dLfgPH0I_12 0 AND THIS IS WHAT GIVES ME MY NINETY DEGREE ANGLE
gb3dLfgPH0I_13 0 SO I'M HOLDING THIS GUY VERY VERY FIRMLY
gb3dLfgPH0I_14 0 THE PAPER'S ATTACHED AND NOW THIS GUY CAN SLIDE ALONG HERE LIKE THIS
gb3dLfgPH0I_15 0 AGAIN PENCIL STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN
gb3dLfgPH0I_16 0 AND NOW I'VE JUST DONE WHAT I NEED TO FOR MY SPACING
gb3dLfgPH0I_17 0 SO THERE THERE ARE ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF TRIANGLES
gb3dLfgPH0I_18 0 BUT BASICALLY THEY ALL HAVE A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE FOR YOU TO WORK WITH
gb3dLfgPH0I_19 0 SOME OF THEM ARE JUST BIGGER IN CASE YOU NEED A BIGGER ONE
gb3dLfgPH0I_20 0 AND OH THE RULER BY THE WAY A GOOD RULER IS A STEEL RULER WITH A CORK BACK
gb3dLfgPH0I_21 0 KEEPS IT FROM SLIDING
gb3dLfgPH0I_22 0 AND IT'S ALSO UP A LITTLE BIT FROM THE PAPER SO THAT IF YOU'RE LINING WITH INK YOU'RE NOT GOING TO RUN THE RISK OF SMUDGING QUITE AS READILY
H7_sFXsBoC0_1 0 IT'S TIME WE DO A SAMPLE HAND AND MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT IT WITH RESPECT TO BARONESS SO IT ALL STARTS WITH A SHUFFLED DECK WHICH WILL BECOME YOUR STOCKPILE AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUT OUT FIVE CARDS
H7_sFXsBoC0_2 0 THESE ARE YOUR FIVE STACKS OR PILES AND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR COMBINATIONS THAT ADD UP TO THIRTEEN
H7_sFXsBoC0_3 0 AT THIS TIME I HAVE NONE SO NOTHING THAT EQUALS THIRTEEN HERE SO I'M GOING TO DEAL OUT FIVE MORE CARDS AND LOOK FOR THIRTEEN'S AND LOOK AT THAT
H7_sFXsBoC0_4 0 THERE'S A JACK PLUS A TWO THAT'S IN PLAY SO THAT GOES OFF TO THE FOUNDATION
H7_sFXsBoC0_5 0 NOW THIS NINE NEEDS A FOUR NOTHING
H7_sFXsBoC0_6 0 SEVEN NEEDS A SIX NOTHING BUT THIS THREE ADDS TO THIS TEN AND GETS MOVED OFF TO THE FOUNDATION AND NOW I CAN CHOOSE ONE OF THESE CARDS TO PULL DOWN TO HERE AND REPLACE THE EMPTY SPOT THAT THE TEN LEFT
H7_sFXsBoC0_7 0 I'M GOING TO CHOOSE THE NINE SO THAT I'LL HAVE THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF OPTIONS AND WE'LL PICK UP WITH THIS HAND IN THE NEXT SEGMENT
gXP6waUe4UM_1 0 BEN GRAHAM THE TRAINERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING THE TEAM HEALTHY
gXP6waUe4UM_2 0 THEY MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE MAINTAINING A PROPER DIET MAINTAINING PROPER STRETCHING AND CALISTHENIC REGIMENS MAKING SURE THEY'RE DOING THEIR WORKOUTS WHEN THEY'RE NOT ON THE FIELD MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE HITTING THE GYM RIGHT DOING THE RIGHT TYPES OF EXERCISES AT THE RIGHT TIMES
gXP6waUe4UM_3 0 TRAINERS ALSO DEAL WITH INJURIES
gXP6waUe4UM_4 0 IF YOU HAVE A PULLED HAMSTRING OR IF YOU'RE NURSING A GIMPY KNEE THE TRAINER IS GOING TO HELP YOU WORK THROUGH THAT
gXP6waUe4UM_5 0 ALSO THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT AFTER THE GAME THE PITCHERS GET THE PROPER HEAT AND THE PROPER ICE ON THEIR ARMS MAKE SURE THEY KEEP WARM AND KEEP STRETCHED OUT
gXP6waUe4UM_6 0 THEY'RE JUST RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL PLAYER STAYS HEALTHY THROUGHOUT THE SEASON

H8A17iNq9i4_1 0 HI THIS IS RACHAEL RICHARDSON WITH NUTROLUTION IN SOUTH BEACH MIAMI FLORIDA
H8A17iNq9i4_2 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO LOOK YOUNGER MORE FASHIONABLE HEALTHIER AND LOSE WEIGHT
H8A17iNq9i4_3 0 I THINK THIS IS A REALLY GREAT TOPIC BECAUSE IT GOES THROUGH MY MIND EVERY NOW AND THEN AND I'M SURE IT GOES THROUGH ALL OF YOUR AS WELL IS WANTING TO LOOK BETTER
H8A17iNq9i4_4 0 A LOT OF TIMES WE THINK THAT GOING OUT TO THE MALL AND BUYING THE NEW TRENDS AND CLOTHES OR THE NEWEST JEWELRY OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE IS GOING TO HELP US TO LOOK BETTER WHEN IN FACT IF YOU TAKE THOSE FEW HOURS AWAY FROM SHOPPING AND SAVE YOURSELF ALL THE MONEY AND GET OUT AND DO SOME EXERCISE AND DO SOME HEALTHY COOKING THAT'S ACTUALLY THE BEST WAY TO LOOK MORE FASHIONABLE HEALTHIER YOUNGER AND BETTER
H8A17iNq9i4_5 0 SO FOCUSING ON GETTING HEALTHIER FOODS AND THAT MEANS BASICALLY REDUCING YOUR PROCESSED FOODS LOOKING AT GETTING A DIET THAT IS RICH IN VEGETABLES RICH IN HEALTHY FATS WHICH IS GOING TO HELP YOUR SKIN MAINTAINING A GOOD HEALTHY MICRO-SYSTEM IN YOUR INTESTINES TO HELP AGAIN WITH YOUR SKIN AND NOURISHING YOUR LIVER AND ALL THE OTHER PARTS OF YOUR BODY

g4sQb4Wpdp0_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO DEFINE POSITIVE CASH FLOW
g4sQb4Wpdp0_2 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU AN EXAMPLE OF BOTH POSITIVE CASH FLOW AND NEGATIVE CASH FLOW
g4sQb4Wpdp0_3 0 ON THE LEFT SIDE WE'LL HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF POSITIVE CASH FLOW ON THE RIGHT SIDE WE'LL HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF NEGATIVE CASH FLOW
g4sQb4Wpdp0_4 0 AT THE TOP WE HAVE CASH IN MINUS CASH OUT AND THAT GIVES US OUR TOTAL CASH FLOW
g4sQb4Wpdp0_5 0 IN A POSITIVE CASH FLOW SITUATION WE WOULD GET CASH IN OF A 1000 DOLLARS AND CASH WOULD GO OUT FOR 500 DOLLARS LEAVING US WITH 500 DOLLARS OF CASH EXTRA SO WE MADE MORE CASH DURING THIS PERIOD THAN WHAT WE SPENT THAT'S POSITIVE CASH FLOW
g4sQb4Wpdp0_6 0 ON THE SECOND EXAMPLE WE ONLY GOT CASH IN OF 200 DOLLARS YET WE HAD TO PAY OUT 500 DOLLARS AND THEREFORE WE HAD NEGATIVE CASH FLOW OF 300 DOLLARS
g4sQb4Wpdp0_7 0 THIS SIMPLY MEANS THAT DURING THAT PERIOD WE GOT IN LESS CASH THAN WE HAD TO PAY OUT
g4sQb4Wpdp0_8 0 AND THAT'S HOW YOU DEFINE CASH FLOW
H5fL0TZnUKU_1 0 THE NEXT TYPE OF TRAIL WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT IS THE BUNNY TRAIL
H5fL0TZnUKU_2 0 THIS IS GENERALLY WHERE LEARNERS FIRST START OFF WHERE LESSONS TAKE PLACE AND WHERE PEOPLE WHO HAVE JUST COME OUT OF LESSONS OR DON'T WANT TO MOVE ON TO A REAL TRAIL YET GO
H5fL0TZnUKU_3 0 YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE USING A CHAIR LIFT MOST OF THEM USE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE AN ESCALATOR AND THINK OF IT AS A MOVING SIDEWALK AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE THAT AND A LITTLE BIT OF A ROPE TOW THEN YOU JUST STAND UP AND HOLD ON TO A RING AND PULL YOURSELF UP
H5fL0TZnUKU_4 0 AS YOU MOVE BEYOND THE BUNNY SLOPE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO START TACKLING THE CHAIR LIFT BUT RIGHT NOW ON THE BUNNY SLOPE YOU ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT
H5fL0TZnUKU_5 0 THE BUNNY SLOPE IN TRADITION IS USUALLY THE SHORTEST AND LEAST STEEP TRAIL OUT OF ALL OF THEM COMPLETELY FLAT
H5fL0TZnUKU_6 0 IT IS JUST SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU GAIN YOUR BALANCE ON THE BOARD OR SKIS
H5fL0TZnUKU_7 0 THEY DON'T WANT TO YOU KNOW THROW YOU TO THE WOLVES AND HAVE YOU ON SOME KIND OF TERRAIN THAT YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOURSELF ON AND BASICALLY IT IS JUST THERE TO HELP YOU GAIN CONFIDENCE ON THE BOARD
G9zy_sHRqe4_1 0 ATHENA REICH IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHERE TO FIND THE BROADWAY AUDITIONS
G9zy_sHRqe4_2 0 THE MOST COMMON PLACE TO LOOK IS EITHER BACKSTAGE OR ACTORSEQUITY.ORG OR ACTORS ACCESS
G9zy_sHRqe4_3 0 BACKSTAGE IS A MAGAZINE BUT IT'S ALSO A NEWSPAPER BUT IT'S ALSO ON THE INTERNET
G9zy_sHRqe4_4 0 SO YOU CAN JOIN A SUBSCRIPTION AND ACCESS EVERYTHING ONLINE
G9zy_sHRqe4_5 0 ACTORSEQUITY.ORG I LIKE TO USE BECAUSE IT HAS ALL ONLY THE UNION AUDITIONS AND ALL THE BROADWAY SHOWS ARE UNION AUDITIONS
G9zy_sHRqe4_6 0 SO IT KIND OF ELIMINATES THE NON-UNION THINGS THE TOURS THE TV THINGS THE WEB TV EPISODES
G9zy_sHRqe4_7 0 ACTORS ACCESS IS ANOTHER GREAT WAY TO FIND AUDITIONS ALTHOUGH IF YOU'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT BROADWAY ACTORSEQUITY.ORG AND BACKSTAGE ARE REALLY THE BEST WAY TO GO
G9zy_sHRqe4_8 0 YOU'RE GOING TO FIND A BREAKDOWN WHICH ON ACTORSEQUITY.ORG WHICH IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE THIS AND THIS IS A PRINTOUT FROM THE WEBSITE
G9zy_sHRqe4_9 0 IT SAYS THE NAME OF THE SHOW WHERE TO GO WHAT TO PREPARE WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR THE DATES THAT THE REHEARSAL START EVERYTHING LIKE THAT
G9zy_sHRqe4_10 0 SO IF YOU WANT TO AUDITION FOR BROADWAY GO TO ACTORSEQUITY.ORG OR BACKSTAGE.COM MAYBE ACTORS ACCESS TOO
h5RN8s9lM1I_1 0 HI THIS IS BRUCE LESSELS FROM ZOAR OUTDOOR ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
h5RN8s9lM1I_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MAKING A CAMPFIRE AND TAKING DOWN A CAMPFIRE AND CAMPFIRE SAFETY
h5RN8s9lM1I_3 0 SO ONCE YOU HAVE A GOOD CAMPFIRE GOING THE NEXT THING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS SETUP SOME COMFORTABLE SEATING AROUND IT SO THAT YOU CAN ENJOY IT FOR THE EVENING
h5RN8s9lM1I_4 0 ONE OF THE FIRST RULES ABOUT SETTING UP CAMPFIRE SEATING IS YOU WANT TO SETUP YOUR SEATING ON THE UP WIND SIDE OF THE FIRE SO PEOPLE AREN'T HAVING TO BREATHE THE SMOKE FROM THE FIRE THAT'S BEING BLOWN DOWN WIND
h5RN8s9lM1I_5 0 OF COURSE WIND IS INEVITABLY CHANGING ALL THE TIME SO THE SMOKE MAY MOVE AND MAY AFFECT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SEATING ARRANGEMENT AT DIFFERENT TIMES BUT THERE'S GENERALLY A MORE DOWN WIND DIRECTION AND THAT'S A GOOD PLACE NOT TO SETUP ANY CAMPFIRE SEATING
h5RN8s9lM1I_6 0 THERE ARE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO CREATE SEATING FOR A CAMPFIRE IF YOU HAVE SOME OLD LOGS YOU CAN FIND IN THE WOODS OR SOME WOOD TO SIT ON THAT CAN BE NICE AND COMFORTABLE AND CAN PROVIDE A BENCH FOR A FEW PEOPLE TO SIT ON
h5RN8s9lM1I_7 0 COOLER IF YOU'RE CAR CAMPING OR CANOE CAMPING AND YOU HAVE A COOLER FOR YOUR FOOD
h5RN8s9lM1I_8 0 THESE COMFORTABLE CAMP CHAIRS ARE A GREAT IDEA IF YOU HAVE ROOM TO CARRY THEM IN A CAR AGAIN OR IN A CANOE AND IF YOU HAVE LESS ROOM IN YOUR BACKPACK OR SOMETHING ONE OF THESE CRAZY CREEK TYPE CHAIRS CAN BE A GOOD OPTION AS WELL
h5RN8s9lM1I_9 0 BUT EITHER WAY MAKE SURE YOU SETUP YOUR SEATING FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE CAMPFIRE SO THAT PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO BE GETTING SPARKS IN THEIR FACES OR ON THEIR CLOTHES A LOT AND SO THAT PEOPLE CAN ENJOY THE WARMTH BUT NOT BE IN TOO MUCH OF DANGER FROM THE FIRE ITSELF
gfy00nD_Nnk_1 0 SO DO YOU NEED HELP ON CHOOSING AN ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH

gfy00nD_Nnk_4 0 THERE'S AS YOU PROBABLY HAVE ALREADY KNOWN IF YOU HAVE GONE OUT THERE TO SHOP FOR ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSHES YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF TOOTHBRUSHES
gfy00nD_Nnk_5 0 ONE THE ONE TOOTHBRUSH THAT WE HAVE HERE IS THE SONICARE TOOTHBRUSH WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THIS TOOTHBRUSH IS THAT THE BRISTLES ON IT ARE REALLY REALLY SOFT
gfy00nD_Nnk_6 0 IT'S A VIBRATION TOOTHBRUSH SO IT JUST MAINLY IT WHENEVER YOU TURN IT ON IT JUST VIBRATES BACK AND FORTH WHICH YOU CAN VERY EVEN TELL THAT IT'S VIBRATING
gfy00nD_Nnk_7 0 AND THEN ALSO TWO IT'S A CHARGEABLE TOOTHBRUSH SO YOU CAN PUT IT ON A CHARGER YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE BATTERIES TO ADD IT TO USE IT JUST CHARGE IT OVERNIGHT
gfy00nD_Nnk_8 0 WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THIS IS BECAUSE THERE'S ACTUALLY IF YOU TAKE A LOOK ON THE BACK HERE IT HAS AN UP AND DOWN THIS IS THE ON BUTTON BUT IT HAS AN UP AND DOWN ARROW BUTTON AND IT'S WHERE YOU CAN SET A TIMER ON YOUR TOOTHBRUSH SO THEREFORE YOU JUST PRESS THE BUTTON IT TURNS ON AND IT AUTOMATICALLY STARTS TO COUNT HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN BRUSHING YOUR TEETH
gfy00nD_Nnk_9 0 SO THIS IS GREAT FOR KIDS AND ADULTS TO HELP YOU BRUSH YOUR TEETH VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO MAKE SURE YOU GET THEM REALLY GOOD AND CLEAN
gfy00nD_Nnk_10 0 THE OTHER TYPE OF TOOTHBRUSH THAT I HAVE IS AN ORAL B TOOTHBRUSH
gfy00nD_Nnk_11 0 BASICALLY THIS IS A PRETTY SIMPLE ONE IT IS A BATTERY OPERATED TOOTHBRUSH AND THEN WHAT THIS ONE DOES IS BASICALLY YOU JUST TURN IT ON AND THE BRISTLES ON IT THIS ALSO A VIBRATION TOOTHBRUSH BUT THE BRISTLES ON IT GO BACK AND FORTH SO IT HELPS KIND OF REALLY MAKE SURE IT'S YOU KNOW DISTURBING THE DEBRIS THAT SETTLE ON YOUR TEETH AND IT'S REALLY FLUSHING OUT THE AREA
gfy00nD_Nnk_12 0 SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS OUT THERE
gfy00nD_Nnk_13 0 SO BASICALLY I WOULD DOUBLE MAKE SURE CHECK WITH YOUR GENERAL DENTIST THEREFORE HE CAN YOU KNOW MAKES GIVE YOU A GOOD RECOMMENDATION FOR THE TYPE OF TOOTHBRUSH THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
gfy00nD_Nnk_14 0 AND ONCE AGAIN MY NAME IS MICHELLE AND I'M A DENTAL ASSISTANT WITH SOLUTIONZ AND I JUST EXPLAINED TO YOU ON HOW YOU CAN CHOOSE THE ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH
Hc6L8tas3XI_1 0 AND SOMETHING THAT I ALSO FAILED TO GO OVER WAS CELL PADDING
Hc6L8tas3XI_2 0 AND I KIND OF TOUCHED ON THIS IN THE LAST ONE BUT CELL PADDING IS LIKE CELL SPACING BUT IN REVERSE
Hc6L8tas3XI_3 0 IN CELL PADDING IT'S THE SPACE BETWEEN YOUR TEXT AND THE WORDS
Hc6L8tas3XI_4 0 AND SO RIGHT NOW THIS TABLE IF YOU LOOK THE WORDS DON'T BUMP ALL THE WAY UP AGAINST THE LEFT HAND SIDE
Hc6L8tas3XI_5 0 NOW CELL PADDING IS TURNED TO FIVE
Hc6L8tas3XI_6 0 IF I WERE TO TAKE THAT DOWN TO ZERO SAVE IT AND REFRESH THIS LOOK ALL MY TEXT IS BUMPED RIGHT UP AGAINST IT
Hc6L8tas3XI_7 0 NOW I COULD TAKE IT UP YOU KNOW YOU CAN GO AS HIGH AS YOU WANT I'M GOING TO TAKE IT UP TO TWENTY JUST TO SHOW YOU HOW CELL PADDING
Hc6L8tas3XI_8 0 AND THIS WILL WORK VERTICALLY AS WELL AS HORIZONTALLY
Hc6L8tas3XI_9 0 SO I REFRESH THIS
Hc6L8tas3XI_10 0 SAY WE HAD MORE CONTENT THAN THE WORD CONTENT
Hc6L8tas3XI_11 0 LET'S ADD A LOT MORE TEXT
Hc6L8tas3XI_12 0 KEEP ADDING TEXT
Hc6L8tas3XI_13 0 SO THERE'S MORE CONTENT THAT WOULD FIT IN HERE
Hc6L8tas3XI_14 0 SO WE'LL SAVE THAT
Hc6L8tas3XI_16 0 IT'S BUMPED IT UP A LITTLE BIT BUT IT'S KEEPING IT AWAY FROM THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM AS WELL AS THE SIDES
G5OsWl7JwAo_1 0 OK WE ARE JUST ABOUT FINISHED OUR ENTRIES
G5OsWl7JwAo_2 0 I'M BOBBY LAREW
G5OsWl7JwAo_3 0 THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS JUST MAKE YOU AWARE OF THINGS THEY CALL ILLEGAL ENTRIES OR ENTRIES THAT WILL REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF POINTS A JUDGE CAN GIVE YOU
G5OsWl7JwAo_4 0 THINGS THAT ARE REALLY JUST GOING TO MAKE YOUR ENTRY NOT GOOD AT ALL OK
G5OsWl7JwAo_5 0 THE FIRST THING IS THIS IF YOU'RE DOING A HEAD FIRST ENTRY THAT MEANS YOU'RE HANDS NEED TO HIT THE WATER FIRST OK
G5OsWl7JwAo_6 0 SO IF YOU'RE DOING A HEAD FIRST ENTRY AND YOUR FEET TOUCH THE WATER
G5OsWl7JwAo_7 0 LET'S SAY YOU'RE DOING A FLIP AND YOU JUST HAPPEN TO SKIM THE WATER WITH YOUR FEET IT'S GOING TO BE CONSIDERED FAIL BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IT HEAD FIRST
G5OsWl7JwAo_8 0 IF YOU'RE DOING A FEET FIRST ENTRY YOUR HANDS CAN'T TOUCH THE WATER FIRST
G5OsWl7JwAo_9 0 ALSO ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THE ARMS IN A HEAD FIRST ENTRY IS THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABOVE THE SHOULDERS OK
G5OsWl7JwAo_10 0 IF YOU DO ANY TYPE OF ENTRY AND IT'S HEAD FIRST AND YOUR ARMS ARE BELOW YOUR SHOULDER LINE THEY'RE GOING TO DEDUCT POINTS
G5OsWl7JwAo_11 0 AND DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS IT COULD BE A LOT IT COULD BE A LITTLE
G5OsWl7JwAo_12 0 NOW SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT JUDGES ARE GOING TO LOOK FOR IN YOUR ENTRIES IS TWISTING
G5OsWl7JwAo_13 0 A LOT OF TIMES WHEN I COACH MY STUDENTS I'LL SAY YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF TWIST IN THERE
G5OsWl7JwAo_14 0 YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF TWIST BECAUSE YOU'RE EITHER MOVING YOUR HIPS THIS WAY OR PULLING TOO HARD WITH ONE OF YOUR SHOULDERS OK
G5OsWl7JwAo_15 0 IF IN THE TWIST AND A HEAD FIRST ENTRY YOU TWIST MORE THAN WHAT THEY CONSIDER NINETY DEGREES IF I'M DOING A HEAD FIRST ENTRY AND I SHOULD BE LANDING THIS WAY BUT I HAPPEN TO TWIST MY BODY MORE THAN NINETY DEGREES OK THEN THEY'RE GOING TO CONSIDER THAT A FAIL DIVE
G5OsWl7JwAo_16 0 SO JUST A COUPLE THINGS OF YOU NEED TO REMEMBER MAKE SURE IN A HEAD FIRST ENTRY YOUR SHOULDERS OR YOUR HANDS ARE ABOVE YOUR SHOULDER MAKE SURE YOUR HANDS TOUCH FIRST AND FEET FIRST MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FEET TOUCH FIRST AND DON'T TWIST YOUR BODY
G5OsWl7JwAo_17 0 THAT'S JUST SOME OF THE THINGS YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF

hExqOxPMcuI_11 0 AND I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND HAVE THIS STOP RIGHT HERE
hExqOxPMcuI_12 0 BEFORE WE GET THIS BRAID GOING WE WANT TO JUST RUBBER BAND THIS PART TO KEEP IT OUT OF THE WAY

gcdxWo6XTtk_1 0 SO NOW THAT YOU'VE GOT YOUR BASE AND YOUR LID ALL FINISHED WITH THE KNOB YOU CAN CUT THIS RIGHT OFF THE BAT WITH YOUR WIRE TOOL BY PRESSING IT AGAINST THE BAT AND PULLING IT UNDERNEATH AND THEN TILT THAT PIECE RIGHT OFF THE BAT
gcdxWo6XTtk_2 0 NOW YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF HOLES FOR AIR FLOW FOR THE GARLIC
gcdxWo6XTtk_3 0 ONE REALLY EASY WAY OF DOING IT IS TO USE THESE HOLE PUNCH TOOLS
gcdxWo6XTtk_4 0 THEY'RE BASICALLY PIPES CUT AT AN ANGLE
gcdxWo6XTtk_5 0 IT GIVES YOU PERFECTLY ROUND HOLES BUT IT HAS A NICE SHARP POINT FOR CUTTING
gcdxWo6XTtk_6 0 NOW IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE LINED UP WITH THE CENTER OF YOUR KNOB BECAUSE YOU CAN TURN THE LID TO MATCH YOUR CUTOUT
gcdxWo6XTtk_7 0 SO I'M GOING TO START BY PUNCHING A LARGE HOLE
gcdxWo6XTtk_8 0 I'M PUSHING IN WITH THE POINTED AREA AND GENTLY TWISTING SO THAT I DON'T HAVE TO PUSH HAVE TOO MUCH PRESSURE GOING INWARDS AND ONCE I'VE GOT THE LARGE HOLE CUT I CAN MAKE LITTLE MARKS AT SYMMETRICAL LOCATIONS FOR THE MID-GRADE SIZE AND FINALLY WITH THE SMALLEST SIZE
gcdxWo6XTtk_9 0 I FIND IT HELPFUL TO MAKE THE MARKS BEFORE YOU CUT THE HOLES
gcdxWo6XTtk_10 0 IT MAKES IT A LITTLE EASIER TO SEE EXACTLY WHERE IT IS
gcdxWo6XTtk_11 0 IF YOU CUT THE HOLE FIRST AND THEN TRY TO MATCH IT IT CAN BE A LITTLE TRICKIER THAN IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD
gcdxWo6XTtk_12 0 SO NOW WE'VE GOT A NICE LITTLE SET OF HOLES TO GIVE SOME AIR FLOW FOR THAT GARLIC AND THIS PIECE IS FINISHED

GJB6ohGT2W4_2 0 NOW IN THIS CLIP WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT DIET AND NUTRITION AND EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T KNOW THE CAUSE OF RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT YOU CAN CHANGE IN YOUR DIET AND IN YOUR LIFESTYLE THAT WILL HELP TO DECREASE THE FREQUENCY AND ALSO THE DURATION FOR RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME
GJB6ohGT2W4_3 0 NOW OF COURSE DEFICIENCY IN IRON AND FOLATE PARTICULARLY HAS STRONG CORRELATION FOR PEOPLE WITH THIS PARTICULAR SYNDROME
GJB6ohGT2W4_4 0 IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR DIET THERE ARE CERTAIN VEGETABLES AND FRUITS YOU CAN CHOOSE THAT CAN HELP INCREASE THAT INTAKE BESIDES TAKING SUPPLEMENTS AND BRUSSEL SPROUTS BESIDES HAVING ANTI-CANCER PROPERTIES ALSO HAVE A LOT OF FOLATE IN THE GREENERY AND IN THE IRON AS WELL BUT YOU GET THE MINERALS IN THE BRUSSEL SPROUTS AND BROCCOLI AS WELL
GJB6ohGT2W4_5 0 A LOT OF THE GREEN VEGETABLES HAVE A LOT OF FOLATE IN THEM
GJB6ohGT2W4_6 0 GREEN PEPPERS AS WELL ARE A GOOD WAY
GJB6ohGT2W4_7 0 THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE EXAMPLES
GJB6ohGT2W4_8 0 WE HAVE LOTS OF GREEN LEAFY SPINACH AND LETTUCE THAT YOU CAN ADD TO YOUR SALADS AND TO YOUR FOOD
GJB6ohGT2W4_9 0 ALL OF THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT IN MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE AN ADEQUATE DAILY RECOMMENDED AMOUNT OF THESE MINERALS IN YOUR DIET AND THAT WILL IN TURN HELP YOU TO DEAL WITH THE SYNDROME OF RESTLESS LEG CONDITION AND TO DECREASE THE DURATION OF THE SYMPTOM
gi4YIIE9Dc0_1 0 WHEN FINDING A LASER SURGEON YOU KNOW THERE'S A MILLION DIFFERENT TYPES OF LASER REMOVAL
gi4YIIE9Dc0_2 0 THERE'S A MILLION DIFFERENT ACTUAL LASERS AND THERE'S SO MANY VARIABLES IN REMOVING TATTOOS THAT I FEEL IT IS PRETTY SERIOUS UNDERTAKING
gi4YIIE9Dc0_3 0 I PERSONALLY HAVE HAD HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF LASER SURGERY AS HAS MY WIFE BECAUSE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I GOT A BUNCH OF CRAPPY TATTOOS THAT I THAT WEREN'T DONE BY SKILLED PRACTITIONERS
gi4YIIE9Dc0_4 0 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT IT'S SOME KIND OF LICENSED AWESOME DERMATOLOGIST TYPE DOCTOR OR LASER SURGEON AND THAT THEY CAN SHOW YOU JUST LIKE AN ARTIST A PORTFOLIO OF WORK THAT THEY HAVE LASERED OFF AND STUFF THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY DONE
gi4YIIE9Dc0_5 0 ANY GOOD LASER SURGEON IS GOING TO HAVE THAT
gi4YIIE9Dc0_6 0 A LOT OF THEM WILL HAVE IT ON THEIR WEBSITE
gi4YIIE9Dc0_7 0 WE HAVE SEVERAL HERE IN ATLANTA THAT ARE VERY GOOD
gi4YIIE9Dc0_8 0 AND THAT'S THE OTHER THING YOUR LOCAL TATTOO STUDIO WILL PROBABLY ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE PLUGGED IN AND REAL AWESOME BE ABLE TO TURN YOU ON TO THEIR GUY

H2gBLuMDU4g_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SOURCE OF OUR PHYSICAL MOVEMENT
H2gBLuMDU4g_2 0 IN TAI CHI THERE'S A MISTAKEN IDEA THAT WE DON'T USE ANY STRENGTH AT ALL
H2gBLuMDU4g_3 0 WHAT WE DON'T USE IS BRUTE FORCE BUT WE DO DEVELOP STRENGTH AND THIS IS DONE THROUGH PROPER ALIGNMENT AND BY KNOWING THE SOURCE OF ALL YOUR PHYSICAL MOVEMENT
H2gBLuMDU4g_4 0 THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE SOURCE OF OUR INTERNAL MOVEMENT WHICH WE WILL SAVE FOR ANOTHER DAY
H2gBLuMDU4g_5 0 SO AS I START IN A BACK STANCE I HAVE TO THINK WHERE AM I GOING TO START MOVING FROM A PHYSICAL WAY
H2gBLuMDU4g_6 0 SO I PUT MY MIND INTO THE BOTTOM OF MY BACK FOOT OR INTO MY WEIGHTED FOOT THIS IS THE SOURCE OF ALL THE TIME OF HOW WE MOVE AND WHERE WE BEGIN OUR MOVEMENT IT COMES FROM THE GROUND UPWARD
H2gBLuMDU4g_7 0 SO AS I COME FORWARD I PUSH WITH MY BACK FOOT BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN I LIFT MY FOOT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO LOSE MY CONNECTION TO MY SOURCE
H2gBLuMDU4g_8 0 SO AS I PUSH FORWARD I'M STILL PUSHING DOWN STILL PUSHING DOWN STILL PUSHING DOWN
H2gBLuMDU4g_9 0 NOW MY WEIGHT IS IN MY FRONT LEG BUT I'M STILL CONNECTED TO THE SOURCE OF MY MOVEMENT
H2gBLuMDU4g_10 0 NOW IF I DECIDE TO GO BACK AGAIN THIS LEG WILL THEN BE THE SOURCE OF MY MOVEMENT
H2gBLuMDU4g_11 0 SO I PUSH PUSH PUSH PUSH PUSH WITH THAT FOOT THEN I CAN PICK THAT FOOT UP STEP OUT IF I WANT
H2gBLuMDU4g_12 0 THEN ONCE AGAIN HERE IS THE SOURCE OF MY MOVEMENT PUSH PUSH PUSH ALWAYS KEEPING CONNECTED TO THE SOURCE AND KNOWING OUR SOURCE
G7xxsR_-mPI_1 0 HI I'M KATE I'M HERE WITH ZOAR OUTDOOR ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HIKING TODAY
G7xxsR_-mPI_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS DAY PACKS RIGHT NOW
G7xxsR_-mPI_3 0 WHEN YOU'RE GOING OUT FOR YOUR HIKE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH STUFF YOU WANT TO BRING HOW COLD IT IS HOW WARM IT IS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND THE APPROPRIATE PACK
G7xxsR_-mPI_4 0 IT CAN BE A SMALL BACKPACK IT CAN BE A HIP PACK OR IT CAN BE A BIGGER DAY PACK
G7xxsR_-mPI_5 0 I LIKE TO USE MY DAY PACK THIS GIVES ME A COUPLE OPTIONS
G7xxsR_-mPI_6 0 I PACK IT UP WITH ALL MY WARM GEAR MY FOOD WHATEVER I HAVE PLENTY OF SPOTS TO ATTACH STUFF IF I NEED TO
G7xxsR_-mPI_7 0 THIS BACKPACK HAS A NICE VENTILATED BACK AREA SO IF IT GETS WARM IT ALLOWS THE AIR TO COME UP BEHIND MY BACK AND COOL ME DOWN
G7xxsR_-mPI_8 0 NO MATTER HOW OR WHAT BACKPACK YOU FIT THE FIRST THING YOU DO TO PUT IT ON IS YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THE HIP BELT ON FIRST AND TIGHTEN IT DOWN THEN YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY WITH YOUR SHOULDER STRAPS AND GET IT NICE AND COMFORTABLE
G7xxsR_-mPI_9 0 YOU WANT MOST OF THE WEIGHT TO BE ON YOUR HIPS EVEN IF IT IS JUST A BACKPACK LIKE THIS
G7xxsR_-mPI_10 0 THE WAY IT SHOULD BE ON THE BOTTOM AND ONCE YOU ADJUST THE HIP BELT YOU'LL FEEL IT ON YOUR HIPS AND IT SHOULD MAKE FOR A PRETTY COMFORTABLE BAG
G7xxsR_-mPI_11 0 IF YOU HAVE JUST THE HIP PACK YOU CAN'T ADJUST YOUR SHOULDER STRAPS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ALL YOUR WEIGHT RIGHT HERE IT'S GOING TO PROBABLY GO ON YOUR BACK AND THIS WILL BE PRETTY COMFORTABLE ALSO
G7xxsR_-mPI_12 0 THESE ARE GOOD FOR IF IT'S WARM OUT IF YOU ONLY NEED A LITTLE BIT OF FOOD YOU'RE DOING A FIVE HOUR HIKE AND YOU PRETTY MUCH WANT TO RUN THESE ARE REALLY GOOD
G7xxsR_-mPI_13 0 BIGGER BACKPACKS DON'T ALLOW FOR GOOD RUNNING ON THE TRAIL BUT DO ALLOW YOU TO HAVE ALL YOUR NICE WARM CLOTHES IN IT AND THIS IS A GREAT OPTION FOR DAY HIKES IF YOU'RE JUST HAVING LUNCH OUT ON THE TRAIL ANYTHING ELSE LIKE THAT
g7jP4WcOVz0_1 0 IN RESTORATIVE YOGA THERE'S MANY BENEFITS
g7jP4WcOVz0_2 0 NOT ONLY WE COULD DISTRESS AND CENTER YOURSELF MORE AND BE ABLE TO FACE YOUR DAY YOU SLEEP BETTER AND THINGS LIKE THAT
g7jP4WcOVz0_3 0 A GREAT WAY TO FIND A RELAXATION IS THINK OF SEVERAL PARTS OF YOUR BODY
g7jP4WcOVz0_4 0 FOR EXAMPLE TO RELAX YOUR JAW AND THESE ARE THINGS TO THINK ABOUT AS WE GO TO THE SERIOUS POSTURES LATER ON
g7jP4WcOVz0_5 0 RELAX THE JAW JUST SWALLOW A FEW TIMES AND LET THE JAW HANG OPEN
g7jP4WcOVz0_6 0 AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU START TO RELAX YOUR CHEEKS WILL FEEL HOLLOW ALLOW THEM TO FEEL HOLLOW JAW'S SLIGHTLY OPEN
g7jP4WcOVz0_7 0 FOCUS ON THE BREATH AND JUST LET YOURSELF MELT INTO THE FLOOR
g7jP4WcOVz0_8 0 AND THESE ARE GOOD INDICATORS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU ARE TENSION-WISE
g7jP4WcOVz0_9 0 YOU WANT YOUR HANDS TO RELAX SO YOU DON'T WANT TO KEEP THEM OUT TOO FAR YOU WANT TO HAVE THEM JUST NICE AND RELAX ON THE FLOOR AS YOU LAY DOWN IN THESE POSTURES THAT I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU
g7jP4WcOVz0_10 0 AND WHEN YOU CLOSE THE EYES LET THE EYELIDS BE HEAVY LET THE BOTTOM LID MEET THE UPPER LID AND LET THE EYES ROLL BACK IN THE HEAD AND FIND THAT NICE PEACEFUL TRANQUIL FEELING OF BEING RELAX
g7jP4WcOVz0_11 0 MANY PEOPLE ARE CONCERN I CAN'T RELAX I CAN'T RELAX
g7jP4WcOVz0_12 0 IF YOU FOCUS ON TRYING TO FIND RELAXATION YOU WILL BE FRUSTRATED
g7jP4WcOVz0_13 0 BUT IF YOU FOCUS ON CONCENTRATING ON INDIVIDUAL BODY PARTS IT WILL HELP AS A WHOLE BODY RELAXATION
G4TtivugIJA_1 0 YOU TYPICALLY NEED AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE AND THEN A PROFESSIONAL DEGREE EITHER AN MD WHICH TAKES FOUR YEARS OR A PHD WHICH TYPICALLY TAKES ABOUT FIVE YEARS
G4TtivugIJA_2 0 THEN IF YOU GO THE MD PHYSICIAN ROUTE YOU NEED A RESIDENCY OF THREE TO SEVEN YEARS AND THEN AT LEAST ONE FELLOWSHIP AND MAYBE AN ADDITIONAL POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP
G4TtivugIJA_3 0 SO YOU'RE REALLY GETTING NEAR FORTY YEARS OF AGE BEFORE YOU GET YOUR FIRST JOB
G4TtivugIJA_4 0 SO IT'S YOU KNOW ABOUT TWENTY YEARS OF TRAINING AFTER COLLEGE IT CAN BE BEFORE YOU'RE QUALIFIED
G4TtivugIJA_5 0 NOW ALONG THE WAY WHILE YOU'RE TRAINING YOU'RE DOING A LOT OF THE WORK
G4TtivugIJA_6 0 SO IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT WORKING
G4TtivugIJA_7 0 YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING WORK AS PART OF TRAINING
G4TtivugIJA_8 0 BUT REALLY IN TERMS OF HAVING A STABLE JOB WHERE YOU HAVE A TITLE THAT DOESN'T END AFTER ONE TO TWO YEARS IT'S ABOUT TWENTY YEARS TO GET THERE
G4TtivugIJA_9 0 SO IT'S A LONG ROAD BUT IT'S FUN ALONG THE WAY OR CAN BE FUN
G4TtivugIJA_10 0 TYPICALLY IF YOU WANT TO RUN A LAB YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A DOCTORAL DEGREE AND A NUMBER OF YEARS OF POSTDOCTORAL WORK
G4TtivugIJA_11 0 WE ALSO HAVE STAFF MEMBERS THAT WORK IN MY LAB MANY OF WHOM JUST HAVE A BA OR BS AND THEN WORK AS TECHNICIANS
G4TtivugIJA_12 0 AND THAT CAN BE VERY FULFILLING BECAUSE RIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE YOU CAN GO INTO A LAB AND WORK AND WE TRAIN YOU ON THE JOB
G4TtivugIJA_13 0 AND THEN THERE IS SORT OF AN INTERMEDIATE LEVEL WHICH THE WOMAN WHO IS MY LAB MANAGER AND RUNS MY LAB IS A VERY CAPABLE PERSON WHO IS A PROFESSIONAL SCIENTIST
G4TtivugIJA_14 0 SHE GOT A MASTER'S AND THAT GAVE HER MORE EXPERIENCE IN HOW TO DO SCIENCE
G4TtivugIJA_15 0 SO SHE ACTUALLY MANAGES OUR LAB
G4TtivugIJA_16 0 SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF MASTER'S LEVEL PEOPLE TOO
G4TtivugIJA_17 0 SO YOU CAN DO IT WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE
G4TtivugIJA_18 0 YOU'RE BETTER OFF WITH A MASTER'S DEGREE
G4TtivugIJA_19 0 IF YOU WANT TO RUN A GROUP YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE A DOCTORAL DEGREE PLUS POSTDOCTORAL WORK
G4TtivugIJA_20 0 I THINK ONE OF THE CENTRAL PERSONAL QUALITIES THAT'S VERY HELPFUL IS TO BE ABLE TO MULTI-TASK
G4TtivugIJA_21 0 SO IN ONE DAY I MIGHT BE IN THE CLINIC IN THE MORNING SEEING A VERY COMPLICATED INFECTIOUS DISEASE CASE AND THEN I'M ACTUALLY TRAINING PHYSICIANS IN TRAINING
G4TtivugIJA_22 0 SO I'M ACTUALLY FLIPPING INTO A TEACHING MODE
G4TtivugIJA_23 0 SO I'M DEALING WITH A PATIENT AND THEN FIVE MINUTES LATER I'M TEACHING AND MEANWHILE MY EMAIL DEVICE IS GOING OFF AND I'M CORRESPONDING WITH ADMINISTRATIVE PEOPLE ABOUT MONEY AND WITH MY SCIENTIST PEOPLE ABOUT DATA AND I'M FLIPPING IN AND OUT OF THOSE JOBS
G4TtivugIJA_24 0 SO I THINK MULTI-TASKING BEING ABLE TO FLIP IN AND OUT OF DIFFERENT WORLDS IS VERY HELPFUL
G4TtivugIJA_25 0 I THINK PATIENCE TOO
G4TtivugIJA_26 0 SOME OF THE RESEARCH WE DO WE'LL DO EXPERIMENTS FOR THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AND NOTHING WILL WORK
G4TtivugIJA_27 0 THERE'S NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT AND YET WE KNOW THE PROJECT IS GOOD AND IT'S IMPORTANT AND WE HAVE TO SEE IT THROUGH
G4TtivugIJA_28 0 SO IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS A RESOLUTION OR A GRATIFICATION WITHIN A DAY OR SOMETHING THIS ISN'T A GOOD CAREER FOR YOU
G4TtivugIJA_29 0 YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE PATIENT
G4TtivugIJA_30 0 I'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR INSTANCE A VACCINE FOR PNEUMONIA FOR CHILDREN SINCE I STARTED IN SCIENCE AND I STARTED IN 1990
G4TtivugIJA_31 0 SO NOW IT'S 2008 SO I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE VACCINE FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS AND IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE
G4TtivugIJA_32 0 SO I HAVE A DREAM THAT ONE DAY I WILL SEE THIS COME TO FRUITION BUT IT MAY BE A THIRTY YEAR PROCESS OR MORE OR I MAY NEVER SEE IT AND I JUST HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT
hfnK2tC7AI8_1 0 I'M JOHN GRADEN FROM THE MARTIAL ARTS TEACHER'S ASSOCIATION
hfnK2tC7AI8_2 0 FAKING IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF ALL FIGHTER'S ARSENAL
hfnK2tC7AI8_3 0 A FAKE IS AN INDIRECT ATTACK AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE EASIEST OF ALL TECHNIQUE FAKES
hfnK2tC7AI8_4 0 THIS IS CALLED THE FRONT SHOULDER FAKE
hfnK2tC7AI8_5 0 IN ORDER FOR A FAKE TO BE EFFECTIVE LET'S JUST START WITH THE RULE
hfnK2tC7AI8_6 0 WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF A FAKE TO GAIN TIME AND TO GAIN DISTANCE
hfnK2tC7AI8_7 0 I GAIN TIME BY GETTING MY OPPONENT TO HESITATE FOR JUST A SECOND MAKING HIM THINK I'M GOING TO FIRE ON HIM SO THAT BUYS ME TIME
hfnK2tC7AI8_8 0 NUMBER TWO I GAIN DISTANCE BY CLOSING AT LEAST HALF THE DISTANCE TO MY OPPONENT SO WE ARE GAINING TIME AND DISTANCE
hfnK2tC7AI8_9 0 SO WE DO THAT WITH THE FRONT SHOULDER FAKE
hfnK2tC7AI8_10 0 FOR A FRONT SHOULDER FAKE NOTICE WE ARE GOING TO FAKE SOMETHING LIKE A JAB
hfnK2tC7AI8_11 0 A FRONT SHOULDER FAKE IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE THREE THINGS MUST BE THERE
hfnK2tC7AI8_12 0 ONE THE WEAPON MUST BEGIN TRAVELING TO THE TARGET
hfnK2tC7AI8_13 0 TYPICALLY ABOUT HALF WAY IS GOOD
hfnK2tC7AI8_14 0 IN OTHER WORDS THAT IS NOT GOING TO DO IT THAT'S GOING TO
hfnK2tC7AI8_15 0 I HAVE GOT TO GET THAT IN THEIR FACE I REALLY WANT THEM TO SEE THAT
hfnK2tC7AI8_16 0 TWO I MUST CONVEY POWER SO I DON'T JUST DO THAT WITH THE ARM BUT I COMBINE THAT BY TURNING THE SHOULDER AND STEPPING HALF WAY IN
hfnK2tC7AI8_17 0 SO NOW THEY GET A SENSE OF ATTACK THEY GET A SENSE OF A WEAPON AND THEY GET A SENSE OF WHAT TARGET IS BEING THREATENED SO THIS MAKES THE TECHNIQUE VERY EFFECTIVE
hfnK2tC7AI8_18 0 THIS MAKES THE TECHNIQUE THE FAKE BELIEVABLE
hfnK2tC7AI8_19 0 THE THIRD ELEMENT IS YOU HAVE GOT TO KIND OF SOMETIMES EXAGGERATE THE INTENSION SO IN OTHER WORDS THIS WON'T WORK AS WELL WATCH
hfnK2tC7AI8_20 0 ONE OR TWO
hfnK2tC7AI8_21 0 NUMBER TWO I KIND OF SOLD THE FAKE BY THINKING I'M GOING TO STEP IN AND WHACK THEM
hfnK2tC7AI8_22 0 SO A GOOD SHOULDER FAKE FRONT SHOULDER FAKE HAND GOES HALF WAY OUT SHOULDER SNAPS I STEP IN AND I'M LOOKING LIKE I AM GOING TO TRY AND KILL THEM
hfnK2tC7AI8_23 0 SOMETIMES I WILL EXHALE REAL HARD JUST SO THAT AUDITORILLY THEY ALWAYS GET THE MESSAGE HERE I COME BUT I'M ALWAYS STEPPING HALF WAY IN
hfnK2tC7AI8_24 0 THEY MAY MOVE THEY MAY FIRE BACK ON ME BUT SINCE I HAVE NOT OVER COMMITTED I'M IN GOOD POSITION
hfnK2tC7AI8_25 0 THAT'S THE FRONT SHOULDER FAKE
hfnK2tC7AI8_26 0 I'M JOHN GRADEN
hfnK2tC7AI8_27 0 FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT ME AT JOHNGRADEN.COM
gVg5bHNCZCQ_1 0 VICTORIA GUTAVAS WE'RE GOING TO BE PREPARING THE FISH HERE AND GETTING IT READY FOR OUR DISH IN THIS PARTICULAR SEGMENT
gVg5bHNCZCQ_2 0 SO WHAT I'VE DONE IS AND LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FISH ITSELF
gVg5bHNCZCQ_3 0 NOW WHEN I WAS GROWING UP GRANDMA USED TO MAKE THIS PARTICULAR DISH WITH HALIBUT
gVg5bHNCZCQ_4 0 IT'S ALSO BEEN MADE WITH COD
gVg5bHNCZCQ_5 0 BUT THE FISH I'M USING TODAY IS TILAPIA AND THE REASON I LIKE TILAPIA ARE FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS ACTUALLY
gVg5bHNCZCQ_6 0 NUMBER ONE IT'S READILY AVAILABLE AND THE TILAPIA CAN ACTUALLY BE PURCHASED AND IT'S VERY ECONOMICAL AS WELL MUCH MORE SO THAN A COD FISH OR A HALIBUT FISH
gVg5bHNCZCQ_7 0 NOW THESE PARTICULAR PIECES OF TILAPIA HAPPENED TO BE GIANT SIZE
gVg5bHNCZCQ_8 0 WHEN THEY CAME THEY WERE ACTUALLY IN A WHOLE FILLET THAT WAS QUITE LARGE
gVg5bHNCZCQ_9 0 SO WHAT I HAVE GONE AHEAD AND DONE ONCE I GOT IT OUT OF THE PACKAGING YOU WANT TO REFRIGERATE YOU FISH PRIOR TO USING IT
gVg5bHNCZCQ_10 0 SO ONCE IT'S IN THE REFRIGERATOR OR ONCE YOU'RE READY TO USE IT GET IT OUT OF THE REFRIGERATOR RINSE IT OFF WITH SOME COLD WATER PUT IT IN A COLANDER LIKE I HAVE HERE
gVg5bHNCZCQ_12 0 IT'LL ACTUALLY KIND OF AIR-DRY FOR YOU TO BE READY TO USE
gVg5bHNCZCQ_13 0 SO WHAT I THEN DO IS I JUST TAKE A COUPLE OF THE PIECES AT A TIME PUT IT INTO THE DISH
gVg5bHNCZCQ_14 0 AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS LIGHTLY SALT AND PEPPER THE FILLETS BECAUSE AS EVERYTHING IS ACTUALLY COOKING TOGETHER YOU WANT YOUR EVERY INGREDIENT TO MIX VERY NICELY AND BRING PUTTING A LITTLE BIT OF SALT ON THIS FISH AND IT'S A MILD SWEET FISH AND THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY I LIKE USING TILAPIA
gVg5bHNCZCQ_15 0 FOR PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE WHOEVER YOU'RE MAKING THIS FOR WHETHER IT'D BE FOR YOURSELF OR FOR FAMILY OR FRIENDS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT PEOPLE BEING LOVING FISH OR WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE BIG FISH EATERS BECAUSE THE TASTE IS VERY VERY MILD ON THE TILAPIA
gVg5bHNCZCQ_16 0 SO LIKE I'M DOING JUST GO AHEAD AND SALT THE FISH LIGHTLY ON BOTH SIDES AND THEN GO TO THE PEPPER AND THIS IS FINE GROUND PEPPER
gVg5bHNCZCQ_17 0 WHEN I USE A PEPPER MILL AND IF YOU HAVE A PEPPER MILL YOURSELF ON THE COARSELY GROUND PEPPER YOU CAN USE A LITTLE LESS
gVg5bHNCZCQ_18 0 AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND PUT SALT AND PEPPER BOTH SIDES OF THE FISH
gVg5bHNCZCQ_19 0 AND BY NOW THE FISH IS MOIST ENOUGH TO WHERE IT'S ACTUALLY HOLDING THE SALT AND PEPPER ON IT BUT NOT DRIPPING WET
gVg5bHNCZCQ_20 0 SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS KIND OF HAVE IT A LITTLE BIT WET BUT NOT DRIPPING
gVg5bHNCZCQ_21 0 AND SO THE FISH NOW IS READY FOR PRESENTATION AND ACTUALLY PLACING INTO THE DISH
gVg5bHNCZCQ_22 0 SO OUR NEXT STEP IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE PREPARING THE POTATOES AND THE ONIONS
gCiyrgVaqR4_1 0 HOW TO MAKE MUSIC ON YOUR COMPUTER
gCiyrgVaqR4_2 0 PART OF ME SAYS HOPEFULLY YOU'RE NOT MAKING MUSIC ON YOUR COMPUTER
gCiyrgVaqR4_3 0 HOPEFULLY YOU'RE RECORDING IT TO YOUR COMPUTER
gCiyrgVaqR4_4 0 HOPEFULLY YOU'RE CAPTURING A A GOOD REPRESENTATION A GOOD PERFORMANCE AND PUTTING THAT INTO YOUR COMPUTER TO MIX TO EDIT SOMETIMES TO TUNE VOCALS SWITCH SOME TIMINGS UP MAYBE EVEN TO SEQUENCE A SONG
gCiyrgVaqR4_5 0 CAPTURE THE MUSIC IN YOU WANT TO HAVE A REALLY DIRECT SIGNAL
gCiyrgVaqR4_6 0 YOU WANT IT TO SOUND GOOD COMING IN
gCiyrgVaqR4_7 0 YOU WANT TO HAVE AS STRAIGHT AND DIRECT A SIGNAL AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE OR DIGITALLY POSSIBLE
gCiyrgVaqR4_8 0 YOU WANT TO CAPTURE THE BEST PERFORMANCE IN THERE
gCiyrgVaqR4_9 0 IF YOU HAVE TO RECREATE THE PERFORMANCE IN THERE IN WITHIN THE COMPUTER YOU'RE DOIN TOO MUCH WITH IT
gCiyrgVaqR4_10 0 IT'S A GREAT PLATFORM FOR EDITING A GREAT PLATFORM FOR TUNING VOCALS
gCiyrgVaqR4_11 0 IT'S A GREAT PLATFORM FOR WELL INSTEAD OF LUGGING A THOUSAND POUND TAPE MACHINE AROUND IT'S REALLY PORTABLE
gCiyrgVaqR4_12 0 IN CERTAIN WAYS IT'S BETTER THAN TAPE
gCiyrgVaqR4_13 0 NOT TO SAY THAT I DON'T LIKE TAPE IS TAPE IS ANY AUDIO ENGINEER'S GOD BUT THE DIGITAL FORUM DIGITAL REALM IS BECOMING MUCH MORE PROFICIENT A LOT CLEANER A LOT YOU KNOW THE FREQUENCY RANGE IS CHANGING SO THAT WE HAVE HIGHER RESOLUTIONS JUST LIKE YOU HAVE HD CAMERAS YOU HAVE HD MUSIC
gCiyrgVaqR4_14 0 UNFORTUNATELY MP3'S DUMBED THAT DOWN A LITTLE BIT
gCiyrgVaqR4_15 0 EVEN CD'S DUMB IT DOWN BUT WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF SAMPLING AND TAKING NINETY SIX THOUSAND PICTURES PER SECOND AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT SO THAT YOU REALLY HAVE A PRISTINE AND HONEST REPRESENTATION OF WHAT WAS REALLY THERE
gCiyrgVaqR4_16 0 TAPE ON THE OTHER HAND USUALLY COLORS IT BUT IN A VERY PLEASING WAY ADDS A NOISE FLOOR JUST A LITTLE HISS THAT KIND OF SETS THE EAR AS TO WHAT VOLUME TO EXPECT
gCiyrgVaqR4_17 0 THERE'S A CERTAIN DEPTH THAT YOU CAN GET WITH TAPE THAT IS JUST INHERENT IN IT
gCiyrgVaqR4_18 0 LET ME JUST GO ONE STEP FURTHER
gCiyrgVaqR4_19 0 IN USING TAPE AND A COMPUTER TOGETHER BECAUSE I THINK YOU GET THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS THIS WAY TIME CODE WILL SYNC UP YOUR TAPE WITH YOUR PRO TOOLS AND THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPERT AND YOU MIGHT HAVE TO BOOK A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR AN HOUR ROOM TO DO IT BUT IF YOU RECORD YOUR DRUMS AND BASS TO TAPE SYNC THAT UP AND THEN PLAY YOUR GUITARS DO YOUR VOCALS DIGITALLY YOU REALLY DO HAVE THE MARRIAGE OF GETTING THE THE CERTAIN LOW END REPRESENTATION THAT TAPE GIVES AND THE WARMTH AND THE DEPTH THAT IT GIVES TO THAT RANGE AND STILL HAVING THE EASE OF EDITING AND AND TUNING AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS EASE OF OPERATION AND THE QUICKNESS THAT RECORDING IN THE DIGITAL REALM GIVES YOU
gCiyrgVaqR4_20 0 MARRY THOSE TWO TOGETHER AND I THINK YOU REALLY DO HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU'RE JUST WORKIN ON A COMPUTER MIXING IN THE BOX IS WHAT THEY CALL IT JUST MAKE SURE YOU GET YOUR GOOD SOUNDS FIRST
gCiyrgVaqR4_21 0 DON'T PUT ANY TRASH INTO YOUR COMPUTER BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GET TRASH OUT AND WHILE YOU CAN CHANGE SOUNDS WITHIN THE COMPUTER YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO TOO MUCH FURTHER OR TOO MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT YOU'VE RECORDED IN THERE THE FIRST TIME
gCiyrgVaqR4_22 0 REALLY YOU DON'T WANT TO DO TOO MUCH WORK IN THERE
gCiyrgVaqR4_23 0 YOU WANT TO JUST GET YOUR SOUNDS LEVELED GET A GOOD MIX OF ON THINGS MAKE SURE YOUR IMAGING IS GOOD PANNING THINGS LEFT AND RIGHT
gCiyrgVaqR4_24 0 THEN GIVE EVERYTHING A SEPARATE LITTLE SPACE IN THERE
gCiyrgVaqR4_25 0 MAKE SURE YOUR VOCALS ARE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE AND THINGS AREN'T MOVIN AROUND UNLESS YOU MAKE THEM MOVE AROUND OR WANT THEM TO
gCiyrgVaqR4_26 0 THERE'S A LOT OF POWER TO BE HAD WHEN MAKING MUSIC IN THE COMPUTER A LOT OF AUTOMATION THINGS
gCiyrgVaqR4_27 0 HAVING SWEEPS AND SOUND EFFECTS MOVE ACROSS YOUR STEREO IMAGE HAVING THINGS MOVE UP AND DOWN EVEN AND IT'S ALL INCLUSIVE IT'S ALL IN ONE BOX
HimMjk-1rg4_1 0 IF YOU FEED YOU DOG RAW MEAT YOU MIGHT NEED TO START ACTUALLY WEIGHING THE FOOD YOU'RE GIVING THEM
HimMjk-1rg4_2 0 THESE ARE CHICKEN NECKS
HimMjk-1rg4_3 0 IF THE DOG WAS YOUNGER AND ACTIVE YOU MIGHT JUST THROW A BUNCH OF CHICKEN NECKS IN AND BE MONITORING THE DOGS WEIGHT AS YOU GO ALONG
HimMjk-1rg4_4 0 IF THEY GET OLDER YOU MIGHT NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE PRECISE ABOUT HOW MUCH IN FACT YOUR DOG IS EATING
HimMjk-1rg4_5 0 SO GETTING YOURSELF A SCALE SO YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY HOW MUCH YOU'RE FEEDING YOUR DOG
HimMjk-1rg4_6 0 IF IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU'RE FEEDING A CERTAIN AMOUNT AND YOUR DOG CONTINUES TO BE HEAVY OR IN FACT GAIN WEIGHT THEN YOU WOULD ACTUALLY JUST FEED LESS PER MEAL UNTIL YOU HIT UPON AN AMOUNT THAT YOU WANT TO FEED
HimMjk-1rg4_7 0 ANOTHER THING THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT WITH DIET IS SUPPLEMENTS ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A LARGE BREED DOG
HimMjk-1rg4_8 0 YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE A JOINT HEALTH SUPPLEMENT
HimMjk-1rg4_9 0 YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD SOMETHING
HimMjk-1rg4_10 0 THESE ARE TABLETS CHEWABLE TABLETS
HimMjk-1rg4_11 0 YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD SOMETHING TO THEIR DIET
HimMjk-1rg4_12 0 YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD DIGESTIVE ENZYMES
HimMjk-1rg4_13 0 CERTAINLY YOGURT WITH WHOLE CULTURES ARE VERY GOOD BUT IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH INDEPENDENT DOG
HimMjk-1rg4_14 0 CERTAINLY A SMALL BREED DOG A MINIATURE BREED DOG IS NOT GOING TO NEED JOINT HEALTH SUPPLEMENTS AS MUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE HANNAH THE ROTTWEILER THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TODAY IS GOING TO NEED THAT
HimMjk-1rg4_16 0 IT ALL REALLY IS GOING TO DEPEND ON THE DOG AND YOU WANT TO WORK WITH YOUR VET AND YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR DOG TO KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR DOG TO BE EATING
GHv8lv8relg_1 0 LET'S DISCUSS HOW TO TREAT A DOG WITH DIARRHEA
GHv8lv8relg_2 0 DIARRHEA IS VERY COMMON IN DOGS
GHv8lv8relg_3 0 DOGS LOVE TO CHEW ON THINGS AND EAT THINGS OFF THE FLOOR AND GET INTO ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT CAUSE DIARRHEA
GHv8lv8relg_4 0 DIARRHEA CAN BE BENIGN AND RESOLVABLE BUT YET AT THE SAME TIME IT CAN LEAD TO OTHER THINGS ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S VOMITING
GHv8lv8relg_5 0 ALWAYS CHECK WITH YOUR VETERINARY OFFICE FIRST TO FIND OUT WHAT THE DIAGNOSIS IS AND HOW BEST TO TREAT DIARRHEA IN A DOG
GHv8lv8relg_6 0 THERE ARE MEDICATIONS THAT CAN BE USED TO SLOW DOWN THE GI SYSTEM
GHv8lv8relg_7 0 ANTIBIOTICS ARE COMMONLY USED AS WELL TO TREAT BACTERIAL OVERGROWTH THAT CAN CAUSE DIARRHEA
GHv8lv8relg_8 0 ALSO DIET PLAYS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN DEALING WITH DIARRHEA AS WELL
GHv8lv8relg_9 0 IN SOME INSTANCES IF THERE'S NAUSEA AND LOTS OF DIARRHEA WE MAY NOT FEED THAT PET FOR TWELVE HOURS OR SO TO LET THE STOMACH REST AND LET THE GI SYSTEM KIND OF COOL DOWN A LITTLE BIT SO IT CAN RESOLVE THE DIARRHEA ITSELF
GHv8lv8relg_10 0 SO THERE ARE MULTIPLE TYPES OF DIARRHEAS
GHv8lv8relg_11 0 PARASITES CAN CAUSE IT DIET CHANGE PEOPLE FOOD STRESS LOTS OF DIFFERENT REASONS CAN DO THAT
GHv8lv8relg_12 0 SO THE FIRST THING TO DO IS FIND OUT WHAT THAT DIAGNOSIS IS AND HAVE YOUR VETERINARY OFFICE HELP YOU FROM THERE
h_8Tw2-93JY_1 0 HI MY NAME IS MICHAEL QUEBEC AND TODAYS SUBJECT IS HOW TO ACHIEVE A SIX PACK
h_8Tw2-93JY_2 0 THERE IS A VARIETY OF EXERCISES THAT YOU CAN DO TO INCREASE MUSCULATURE AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO COMBINE THAT WITH YOUR EATING HABITS MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO LOWER YOUR BODY FAT PERCENTAGE SO THAT WHATEVER MUSCULATURE YOU DO GAIN ACTUALLY SHOES
h_8Tw2-93JY_3 0 WITH THAT IN MIND I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE SOME MEDICINE BALL EXERCISES AND OF COURSE AS YOU GET STRONGER YOU INCREASE RESISTANCE BY GETTING A BIGGER HEAVIER MEDICINE BALL
h_8Tw2-93JY_4 0 THE CONCEPT HERE IS TO HIT THE TOP THE BOTTOM AND THE SIDES OR OBLIQUES OF YOUR ABS IN YOUR EXERCISES AS WELL AS DOING MULTI MUSCLE EXERCISES
h_8Tw2-93JY_5 0 KEEP IN MIND THAT THE EXERCISES I'M DEMONSTRATING ARE JUST FOUR THERE IS A VARIETY OF OTHERS THAT WORK JUST AS WELL
h_8Tw2-93JY_6 0 I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE SOME CRUNCHES WITH THE MEDICINE BALL
h_8Tw2-93JY_7 0 AND I'M GOING TO PULSE UP FOR THREE THIS IS GOING TO ATTACK THE TOP AND THE FRONT OF MY ABS
h_8Tw2-93JY_8 0 HOLDING THE BALL RIGHT AT MY CHEST I TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN
h_8Tw2-93JY_9 0 AND THEN I PULSE UP FOR THREE ONE TWO AND THEN THREE
h_8Tw2-93JY_10 0 AND THEN I LET MYSELF DOWN
h_8Tw2-93JY_11 0 ONE TWO THREE AND THEN DOWN
h_8Tw2-93JY_12 0 SO THAT'S THE FIRST ONE AND YOU WANT TO DO THOSE FOR IF YOU ARE JUST STARTING OUT ABOUT TWELVE
h_8Tw2-93JY_13 0 ONE SET OF TWELVE
h_8Tw2-93JY_14 0 IF YOU ARE AN ADVANCED EXERCISER TWO SETS OF TWELVE AND THEN LATER ON TWO SETS OF TWENTY AND THEN YOU INCREASE THE REPS AND THEN INCREASE THE WEIGHT AS YOU MOVE ON
h_8Tw2-93JY_15 0 SO TO REITERATE FOR THE TOP OF THE ABS THIS IS PULSING ONE TWO THREE AND THEN DOWN
h_8Tw2-93JY_16 0 ONE TWO THREE AND THEN DOWN
h_8Tw2-93JY_17 0 MAKING SURE THAT YOU DON'T STRAIN YOUR NECK
h_8Tw2-93JY_18 0 ALRIGHT SO WE HANDLED THE TOP LET'S HANDLE THE BOTTOM HALF I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND HOLD THE BALL RIGHT BEHIND ME EXTENDING MY ARMS AWAY FROM ME
h_8Tw2-93JY_19 0 I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND EXTEND MY LEGS OUT POINTING MY TOES
h_8Tw2-93JY_20 0 I'M GOING TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN AND THEN I BREATH OUT GOING AS LOW AS I CAN STRAINING MY STOMACH THE BOTTOM OF MY STOMACH WITHOUT STRAINING MY LOWER BACK AND THEN I COME UP
h_8Tw2-93JY_21 0 IF YOU ARE NEW TO EXERCISE ONE SET OF TWELVE IF YOU ARE AN ADVANCED EXERCISER TWO SETS OF TWENTY FIVE TWO SETS OF TWENTY WHATEVER YOU FEEL YOU CAN HANDLE
h_8Tw2-93JY_22 0 OBVIOUSLY AT THIS POINT THE BALL IS JUST A BRACE SO YOU DON'T NEED TO NECESSARILY INCREASE THE WEIGHT OF THE BALL BUT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF REPS ALRIGHT THE OBLIQUES
h_8Tw2-93JY_23 0 I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND FACE FACE YOU LIKE THIS
h_8Tw2-93JY_24 0 CHEST IS UP PROUD CHEST KNEES ARE BENT
h_8Tw2-93JY_25 0 AND I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND LIFT OF THE HEELS OFF THE FLOOR I'M GOING TO KEEP MY STOMACH HELD IN TIGHT AND I'M GOING TO TWIST FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
h_8Tw2-93JY_26 0 EACH SIDE COUNTS FOR HALF SO THIS IS ONE ONE TWO TWO THREE THREE FOUR FOUR
h_8Tw2-93JY_27 0 IF YOU ARE NEW TO EXERCISE ONCE AGAIN ONE SET OF TWELVE WILL DO
h_8Tw2-93JY_28 0 IF YOU ARE AN ADVANCED EXERCISER YOU WANT TO INCREASE THE REPS
gdI_u0ZOSp0_1 0 HI MY NAME IS DAVE ANDREWS
gdI_u0ZOSp0_2 0 TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO USE STICKY KEYS IN WINDOWS
gdI_u0ZOSp0_3 0 LET'S GO TO THE COMPUTER
gdI_u0ZOSp0_4 0 STICKY KEYS IS A FUNCTION THAT WAS ADDED BY MICROSOFT FOR ACCESSIBILITY
gdI_u0ZOSp0_5 0 SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE CTRL ALT AND DELETE KEYS ON YOUR COMPUTER OR THE ALT AND F4 KEY OR JUST ANY COMBINATION OF KEYS
gdI_u0ZOSp0_6 0 IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT FOR SOME PEOPLE
gdI_u0ZOSp0_7 0 ONE WAY TO TURN THE STICKY KEYS ON IS TO PRESS THE SHIFT KEY FIVE TIMES
gdI_u0ZOSp0_8 0 IT WILL THEN POP UP A STICKY KEYS MESSAGE THAT SAYS DO YOU WANT TO TURN ON STICKY KEYS
gdI_u0ZOSp0_9 0 WE'RE GOING TO SAY YES
gdI_u0ZOSp0_10 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU ONE EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU MIGHT NEED TO USE IT FOR
gdI_u0ZOSp0_11 0 I'M GOING TO OPEN UP THE COMPUTER WINDOW AND TO CLOSE A WINDOW YOU CAN HOLD DOWN THE ALT KEY AND PRESS F4 BUT SINCE WE HAVE STICKY KEYS TURNED ON I CAN SIMPLY PRESS THE ALT KEY NOT HOLD IT DOWN AND THEN PRESS F4 BUTTON
gdI_u0ZOSp0_12 0 THAT ACTS AS THOUGH I WAS HOLDING DOWN THE ALT KEY WHEN I PRESSED F4
gdI_u0ZOSp0_13 0 TO TURN STICKY KEYS OFF JUST PRESS THE SHIFT KEY FIVE TIMES AGAIN AND IT'S OFF
gdI_u0ZOSp0_14 0 MY NAME IS DAVE ANDREWS AND I'VE JUST SHOWED YOU HOW TO USE STICKY KEYS IN WINDOWS

GYC323nF-1A_4 0 AND YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO HOLD THOSE BECAUSE FOAM IS A PRETTY STIFF SURFACE AND YOU DON'T WANT THOSE TO COME APART SO JUST REMEMBER TO PINCH THOSE AND HOLD THEM THERE FOR ABOUT TEN SECONDS YOU DON'T WANT TO GET TO IMPATIENT WITH THESE OR THEY WILL COME APART
GYC323nF-1A_5 0 AND IF YOU HAVE ANY EXCESS GLUE THAT COMES OUT YOU CAN JUST WIPE THAT AWAY AND NOW YOU HAVE THE FIRST HALF OF YOUR COOKIE AND YOU WANT TO HAVE A GOOD OPENING IN THERE BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE YOUR PLACE CARD IS GOING TO GO
GrSGwmMdamM_1 0 SO RANDI COME IN TO MY BATHROOM
GrSGwmMdamM_2 0 AND WHAT I WANT RANDI TO DO IS TO GO THROUGH SOME ITEMS HERE AND EDUCATE US INTO THE INGREDIENTS AND READING THE LABELS
GrSGwmMdamM_3 0 SO WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE
GrSGwmMdamM_4 0 THE FIRST THING THAT I SEE IS LIPSTICK
GrSGwmMdamM_5 0 DID YOU KNOW THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN WOMAN WILL END UP SWALLOWING TEN POUNDS OF PETROLEUM BYPRODUCT FROM WEARING LIPSTICK ON A DAILY BASIS
GrSGwmMdamM_6 0 THAT IS BECAUSE MOST LIPSTICKS ARE MADE WITH PETROLEUM BYPRODUCTS
GrSGwmMdamM_7 0 SO READ THE LABELS BY LIPSTICKS THAT ARE MADE WITHOUT PETROLEUM BYPRODUCTS
GrSGwmMdamM_8 0 WHAT'S SO BAD ABOUT PETROLEUM
GrSGwmMdamM_9 0 WELL IT COMES FROM A HIGHLY TOXIC SUBSTANCE PETROLEUM AND WHEN YOU INGEST IT INTO YOUR BODY EVEN IN TRACE AMOUNTS OBVIOUSLY TEN POUNDS IS A LOT BUT THAT'S THROUGH TRACE AMOUNTS
GrSGwmMdamM_10 0 IT'S THROUGH LICKING YOUR LIPS WITH YOUR LIPSTICK ON DAILY
GrSGwmMdamM_11 0 WHAT ABOUT LIKE THIS THIS HAS PETROLEUM IN IT
GrSGwmMdamM_12 0 YEA I WOULD NEVER USE THIS EVER NO
GrSGwmMdamM_14 0 SO HERE WE HAVE A BASIC MOISTURIZING CREAM HAND CREAM HERE'S THE LIST OF INGREDIENTS
GrSGwmMdamM_15 0 YOU START READING DOWN AND YOU SEE ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CAUSES OF CONTACT DERMATITIS WHICH IS SWELLING RASH BREAK OUTS
GrSGwmMdamM_16 0 IT'S THE NUMBER ONE DERMATOLOGICAL PROBLEM IS ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO THIS INGREDIENT DIAZOLIDINYL UREA AND IT'S IN 99 PERCENT OF ALL PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS
GrSGwmMdamM_17 0 SO EVEN IF WE CAN'T PRONOUNCE IT WE CAN CERTAINLY LEARN HOW TO WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THE RULE IS IS THAT IF YOU CAN'T PRONOUNCE IT YOU SHOULDN'T BE HAVING IT IN YOUR BODY
GrSGwmMdamM_18 0 IT'S LIKE THE THINGS THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY IF YOU HAD OUR SKIN CARE PRODUCTS THAT WE USE YOU COULD ACTUALLY EAT BECAUSE THEY'RE SO PURE
GrSGwmMdamM_19 0 AND THAT'S SORT OF THE LITMUS TEST IF YOU CAN'T PRONOUNCE IT AND YOU CAN'T EAT IT WHY WOULD YOU PUT IT IN YOUR BODY OR ON YOUR BODY
GrSGwmMdamM_21 0 WHY WOULD YOU LET IT GO INTO YOUR SKIN
GrSGwmMdamM_22 0 THE NEXT THING THAT WE SEE IS COMMON BABY POWDER
GrSGwmMdamM_23 0 THE KEY INGREDIENT TO THIS IS TALC IT'S A FILLER IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
GrSGwmMdamM_24 0 IT JUST CLOGS THE POURS AND CAUSES DIRT AND DEBRIS TO STAY LOCKED INTO THE SKIN AND IT'S WHY A LOT OF BABIES HAVE RASHES
GrSGwmMdamM_25 0 BUT THEN YOU START PUTTING THE TALC ON THEM AND IT INCREASES THE RASH
GrSGwmMdamM_26 0 SO YOU START INTO THIS VICIOUS
GrSGwmMdamM_27 0 YOUR SKIN CAN'T BREATH
GrSGwmMdamM_28 0 YOUR SKIN CAN'T BREATH AND YOU START INTO A VICIOUS CYCLE
hdNqibUubIU_1 0 THE NEXT THING WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS THE SUBSTRATE FOR YOUR AQUARIUM SUBSTRATE IS JUST A FANCY WAY OF SAYING BEDDING
hdNqibUubIU_2 0 IT'S AN AQUARIUM BUT IT STILL HAS BEDDING ON THE BOTTOM OF IT AND WHAT WE'LL BE USING FOR THAT IS SOME GRAVEL ESSENTIALLY
hdNqibUubIU_3 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE BUYING YOUR GRAVEL FROM A PET STORE OR MAKE SURE THAT IT IS PET SAFE
hdNqibUubIU_4 0 NOT ALL GRAVEL IS CREATED EQUAL
hdNqibUubIU_5 0 SOME OF IT CAN LEAK THINGS IN TO YOUR WATER AND CAN CREATE PROBLEMS
hdNqibUubIU_6 0 ALSO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE BUYING A VERY LARGE GRAVEL
hdNqibUubIU_7 0 THIS PARTICULAR ON IS CALLED A RIVER CREEK PEBBLE
hdNqibUubIU_8 0 IT'S LARGER THAN WHAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY SEE IN A FISH AQUARIUM
hdNqibUubIU_9 0 THE REASON THAT IS IS BECAUSE TURTLES DO HAVE A TENDENCY SOME TIMES TO LIKE TO TRY TO EAT GRAVEL
hdNqibUubIU_10 0 SO YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM AS BIG OF A PIECE AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WE ELIMINATE THAT PROBLEM
hdNqibUubIU_11 0 YOU'RE GOING TO NEED ABOUT FIVE GALLONS OF GRAVEL PER FIVE GALLONS OF TANK
hdNqibUubIU_12 0 SO IF YOU HAVE A FORTY GALLON TANK YOU'RE GOING TO NEED FORTY POUNDS OF GRAVEL
hdNqibUubIU_13 0 THIS IS A 25 POUND BAG SO WE'RE GOING TO PROBABLY NEED TWO BAGS AND WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE BIT LEFT OVER
hdNqibUubIU_14 0 YOU'LL TAKE THAT AND YOU'LL SPREAD IT IN THE BOTTOM
hdNqibUubIU_15 0 YOU WANT ABOUT AN INCH OR SO OF GRAVEL ON THE BOTTOM
hdNqibUubIU_16 0 MAKE SURE IT'S ALL COVERED NICE AND EVEN
hdNqibUubIU_17 0 NOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO PUT AND ROCKS OR THINGS LIKE THAT IN HERE FOR HIM TO GET UP ON YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU PUT THOSE IN FIRST AND PUT THE GRAVEL AROUND THEM
hdNqibUubIU_18 0 THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE LARGE ROCK STRUCTURES SITTING ON GRAVEL THAT COULD POSSIBLY MOVE AND CAUSE YOUR ROCK STRUCTURE TO FALL OVER AND BREAK THE GLASS OF THE AQUARIUM BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE TO BUY A WHOLE NEW AQUARIUM AND YOU HAVE A MESS TO CLEAN UP AS WELL
hdNqibUubIU_19 0 SO THAT IS THE TYPE OF GRAVEL YOU'RE GOING TO USE AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PART HERE
goM_ABXkC9s_1 0 SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR FIRST FOUR MEASURES AND YOU WANT TO WRITE THIS DOWN AT HOME
goM_ABXkC9s_2 0 AGAIN IF YOU DON'T HAVE MANUSCRIPT PAPER YOU CAN JUST WRITE BAR LINES ON A BLANK PIECE OF PAPER LIKE SO WRITE D FLAT MINOR AND E MINOR
goM_ABXkC9s_3 0 AND YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE TUNE LAND DO THAT SO YOU CAN THROUGH AND REFERENCE BACK
goM_ABXkC9s_4 0 WE START RIGHT HERE ON OUR D FLAT MINOR RIGHT AND ON OUR D FLAT SCALE THAT'S ONE RIGHT D FLAT
goM_ABXkC9s_5 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO WRITE THAT DOWN AND INDICATE IT WITH A LOWER CASE ROMAN NUMERAL BECAUSE IT'S MINOR
goM_ABXkC9s_6 0 MAJOR SCALES GET UPPERCASE ROMAN NUMERALS
goM_ABXkC9s_7 0 THEN WE HAVE E SO WE HAVE D FLAT E RIGHT D FLAT E F G BUT WE SHOULD BE GOING D FLAT E FLAT F G FLAT
goM_ABXkC9s_8 0 SO WE HAVE AN E SO THAT IS A TWO SHARP TWO MINOR
goM_ABXkC9s_9 0 RIGHT BECAUSE INSTEAD OF E FLAT WE HAVE E SO THAT'S OUR SHARP TWO MINOR AND THOSE ARE OUR FIRST TWO CHORDS OUR ONE TO OUR SHARP TWO
goM_ABXkC9s_10 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO FIND THEM
goM_ABXkC9s_11 0 SO IF THIS IS OUR D FLAT RIGHT HERE RIGHT
goM_ABXkC9s_12 0 SO WE HAVE ONE MINOR AND I'M JUST PLAYING A LATIN BASS SO WE CAN JUST KIND OF STICK ON THAT ONE AND THAT IS JUST GOING UP A STRING AND UP TWO FRETS TO THE FIFTH
goM_ABXkC9s_13 0 AND THEN THE OTHER FIFTH IS ON THE SAME FRET A STRING BELOW
goM_ABXkC9s_14 0 SO WE HAVE ONE TWO HERE'S OUR SHARP TWO RIGHT IF WE HAVE ONE TWO OUR SHARP TWO IS RIGHT THERE
goM_ABXkC9s_15 0 SO ONE TO SHARP TWO ONE TO SHARP TWO
goM_ABXkC9s_16 0 SO MAKE SURE YOU GET THAT UNDER YOUR FINGERS AND MAKE SURE YOU REALLY GET WHERE THAT ONE AND THAT SHARP TWO ARE SO WHEN WE GO THROUGH AND APPLY OUR SCALES AND WALK THROUGH THESE CHORDS YOU CAN JUST FOLLOW RIGHT IN TO THAT
h749Xa_kMH4_1 0 HELLO LET'S TALK ABOUT WATER COLOR PAPERS
h749Xa_kMH4_2 0 YOU WONDER HOW MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAPER THERE CAN BE
h749Xa_kMH4_3 0 IT'S JUST WATER COLOR ON PAPER RIGHT
h749Xa_kMH4_4 0 WELL NOT EXACTLY
h749Xa_kMH4_5 0 AND LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAPER THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO WATER COLOR ARTIST
h749Xa_kMH4_6 0 FIRST OF ALL MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO USE 140 POUND PAPER OFTEN BY A FOREIGN MAKER
h749Xa_kMH4_7 0 THIS IS 140 POUND ARCHES PAPER A-R-C-H-E-S WHICH THE FRENCH WOULD SAY ARCH
h749Xa_kMH4_8 0 AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS IS A FULL SHEET THAT HAS DECKLED EDGES
h749Xa_kMH4_9 0 WHEN WE WORK IN FULL SHEET THIS IS THE SIZE THAT THEY WOULD REFER TO THEIR ALSO DOUBLE ELEPHANTS
h749Xa_kMH4_10 0 AND I'LL SHOW YOU SOME SMALLER SIZES
h749Xa_kMH4_11 0 THIS IS A HALF SHEET IN A MUCH HEAVIER PAPER
h749Xa_kMH4_12 0 THESE ARE BOTH COLD PRESSED PAPERS
h749Xa_kMH4_13 0 140 OF THESE A REAM OF THESE WILL WEIGH 140 POUNDS BUT A REAM OF THESE WILL WEIGH 300 POUNDS AND YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE PAPER
h749Xa_kMH4_14 0 THERE'S ANOTHER KIND OF PAPER CALLED HOT PRESS AS VERSES THIS COLD PRESS PAPER THAT I'VE SHOWN YOU
h749Xa_kMH4_15 0 AND YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH SMOOTHER THE SURFACE OF THAT PAPER IS
h749Xa_kMH4_16 0 IT'S ALMOST GLASSY AND THE PAINT SITS ON IT DIFFERENTLY
h749Xa_kMH4_17 0 IT DOESN'T ABSORB
h749Xa_kMH4_18 0 YOU COULD POUR A HALF A GALLON OF WATER PRACTICALLY ON A 300 POUND PAPER
h749Xa_kMH4_19 0 ON THIS IT WOULD TEND TO SIT MUCH MORE AND BE LESS ABSORBENT
h749Xa_kMH4_20 0 THERE ARE TABLETS OF PAPER
h749Xa_kMH4_21 0 SOME TABLETS HAVE ONLY NINETY POUND WEIGHT PAPER
h749Xa_kMH4_22 0 AND NINETY POUND ESPECIALLY NEEDS TO BE STRETCHED BECAUSE AFTER YOU'VE GOTTEN IT ALL WET IT WILL BE VERY WAVY AND YOU WON'T END UP WITH A SMOOTH SURFACE
h749Xa_kMH4_23 0 SO YOU'LL NEED TO TAPE OR PIN THE EDGES OF NINETY POUND PAPER
h749Xa_kMH4_24 0 THERE ARE THIS IS AN INDIAN PAPER
h749Xa_kMH4_25 0 AND YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN THAT
h749Xa_kMH4_26 0 THIS IS ALSO A HANDMADE PAPER
h749Xa_kMH4_27 0 BOTH ARCHES AND FABRIANO WHICH IS AN ITALIAN MAKER HAVE BEEN MAKING PAPERS LIKE THIS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS
h749Xa_kMH4_28 0 AND FABRIANO HAS JUST A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TEXTURE TO IT THAN ARCHES
h749Xa_kMH4_29 0 BUT IF THE PAPER DOESN'T LOOK GOOD FROM THE FRONT YOU CAN TURN IT OVER AND USE THE BACK
h749Xa_kMH4_30 0 IT'S REALLY NOT TERRIBLY DIFFERENT
h749Xa_kMH4_31 0 YOU CAN ALSO CUT THESE WITH SCISSORS CERTAINLY OR YOU CAN JOSTLE THEM AND USE THEM FOR ACRYLICS OR OIL OR SOMETHING ELSE
h749Xa_kMH4_32 0 YOU CAN BUY WATER COLOR PAPER IN BLOCKS
h749Xa_kMH4_33 0 AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT ANOTHER TIME
h749Xa_kMH4_34 0 BUT THE BLOCKS ARE GLUED ON FOUR SIDES AND REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF TOO MANY RIDGES AS YOU'RE PAINTING AND GETTING YOUR PAPER REALLY WET
h749Xa_kMH4_35 0 THIS IS AGAIN AN ARCHES PAPER COLD PRESS
h749Xa_kMH4_36 0 THIS IS FINE GRAIN AS OPPOSED TO A KIND OF PAPER YOU CAN BUY WHICH IS TERMED ROUGH
h749Xa_kMH4_37 0 AND YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SURFACE QUALITY OF THE PAPER AND ROUGH
h749Xa_kMH4_38 0 I HOPE THAT THIS HAS GIVE YOU SOME IDEA OF THE VARIATIONS OF COMMONLY USED WATER COLOR PAPERS AND IT CERTAINLY WILL EFFECT HOW YOU PAINT AND AND WHERE YOU CAN TAKE THESE PAPERS WHETHER IT'S OUTDOORS OR IN
h749Xa_kMH4_39 0 I HOPE THAT'S HELPED YOU MAKE SOME SELECTION
h749Xa_kMH4_40 0 MY NAME IS EILEEN PESTORIUS THANKS UNTIL NEXT TIME
gNQ8T42zsuw_1 0 LET'S TRAVEL WITH OUR EGYPTIAN WALK WITH OUR SAIIDI ARMS BUT LET'S ADD A LITTLE VARIATION TO THEM

gNQ8T42zsuw_8 0 THE LEFT HIP COMES UP
gNQ8T42zsuw_9 0 STEP AND LIFT
gNQ8T42zsuw_11 0 MAKE SURE THE KNEES ARE BENT
gNQ8T42zsuw_12 0 THE HIP IS LIFTING DIRECTLY UP INTO THE RIB CAGE
gNQ8T42zsuw_14 0 STEP AND LIFT
gNQ8T42zsuw_15 0 PUT PRESSURE ON THAT TOE
gNQ8T42zsuw_16 0 DON'T LET THAT TOE JUST KIND OF FLY AROUND
gNQ8T42zsuw_17 0 YOU WANT PRESSURE ON THE BALL OF THE FOOT
gNQ8T42zsuw_19 0 STEP AND LIFT
gNQ8T42zsuw_20 0 LET'S TAKE IT TRAVELING STEPPING RIGHT FOOT

gNQ8T42zsuw_26 0 TAKE IT BACK
gNQ8T42zsuw_42 0 SEE YOU CAN TAKE IT A LITTLE FASTER BUT MAKE SURE YOU HAVE NICE CLEAN ISOLATIONS BEFORE YOU GET IT TOO FAST AND TOO SLOPPY
GB2lr7yvg-E_1 0 LET'S TALK NOW ABOUT A NECESSITY WHILE YOU'RE ICE FISHING AND USING MINNOWS OR SHINERS FOR BAIT ON YOUR TIP UPS AND THAT'S ACTUALLY GETTING THEM OUT OF THE BAIT BUCKET
GB2lr7yvg-E_2 0 THESE BAIT BUCKETS YOU FILL THEM ABOUT HALF FULL THREE QUARTERS WITH WATER
GB2lr7yvg-E_3 0 THE MINNOWS GO IN THEM
GB2lr7yvg-E_4 0 THEY HAVE A POP TOP
GB2lr7yvg-E_5 0 AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET THE MINNOWS OUT
GB2lr7yvg-E_6 0 YOU COULD USE THE SCOOP IF YOU HAVE YOUR MINNOWS IN A FIVE GALLON BUCKET SAY BUT FOR THIS MY SCOOP'S JUST TOO BIG TO GET IN THERE
GB2lr7yvg-E_7 0 WHAT I HAVE IS SIMPLY A SMALL PLASTIC SCOOP
GB2lr7yvg-E_8 0 IT'S DESIGNED TO GET MINNOWS OUT OF BAIT BUCKETS
GB2lr7yvg-E_9 0 THEY ALSO MAKE ONES THAT ARE MADE OF MORE OF A MESH NETTING MATERIAL
GB2lr7yvg-E_10 0 I FOUND THAT THOSE ARE NOT GOOD TO USE BECAUSE THEY FREEZE UP VERY EASILY
GB2lr7yvg-E_11 0 THEY'LL FREEZE TO THE SIDES OF YOUR BAIT BUCKET TO THE TOP AND THEN WHEN YOU TRY TO REMOVE THEM ALL THAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS YOUR NETTING RIPS AND YOU HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER ONE
GB2lr7yvg-E_12 0 THESE PLASTIC SCOOPS ARE ONLY A COUPLE BUCKS
GB2lr7yvg-E_14 0 IF THEY ICE UP YOU CAN SIMPLY GENTLY TAP THEM
GB2lr7yvg-E_15 0 SEE IF I CAN GET A MINNOW IN HERE
GB2lr7yvg-E_16 0 SCOOPS A MINNOW

gdENWgq54iI_1 0 OH HAVE YOU EVER REALLY FELT REALLY TIGHT AND YOU JUST CAN'T BEND OVER AND TOUCH YOUR TOES OR YOU JUST FEEL LIKE OH I JUST NEED A GOOD STRETCH
gdENWgq54iI_2 0 HI EVERYONE I'M CAROL ANN WITH STUDIO GROUP X AND I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO BECOME FLEXIBLE
gdENWgq54iI_3 0 NOW FIRST OF ALL FLEXIBILITY IS VERY IMPORTANT
gdENWgq54iI_4 0 IT HELPS TO PREVENT INJURY
gdENWgq54iI_5 0 IT KEEPS YOU NICE AND SUPPLE AND TONED SO WE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON FLEXIBILITY
gdENWgq54iI_6 0 SOMETIMES WE FORGET ABOUT IT AND WE DO OUR CARDIO EXERCISING AND OUR WEIGHT TRAINING AND WE JUST KIND OF DITCH THE STRETCHING AT THE END BUT FLEXIBILITY IS HUGELY IMPORTANT NUMBER ONE
gdENWgq54iI_7 0 NOW YOU CAN BECOME FLEXIBLE BY DOING SOME TRADITIONAL STRETCHING FOR EXAMPLE LIKE A TRICEPS STRETCH
gdENWgq54iI_8 0 YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BRING YOUR HAND DOWN BEHIND YOUR HEAD AND JUST STRETCH OUT THE TRICEPS AND THAT'S GREAT TO DO
gdENWgq54iI_9 0 YOU CAN DO YOUR TRADITIONAL STRETCHING AFTER EVERY WORKOUT THAT YOU DO BUT IF YOU DO STRADISH TRADITIONAL STRETCHING YOU WANT TO REMEMBER THAT YOU'RE STRETCHING EVERY MAJOR MUSCLE IN YOUR BODY SO YOUR SHOULDERS YOUR BICEPS YOUR TRICEPS YOUR ABS YOUR BACK YOUR QUADS YOUR HAMSTRINGS
gdENWgq54iI_10 0 YOU WANT TO HIT ALL THOSE MAJOR MUSCLES
gdENWgq54iI_11 0 NOW WHEN YOU'RE STRETCHING YOU WANT TO HOLD YOUR STRETCH TO THE POINT OF MILD DISCOMFORT
gdENWgq54iI_12 0 PAIN IS NOT GOOD NO PAIN BUT MILD DISCOMFORT IS GOOD
gdENWgq54iI_13 0 AND YOU WANT TO HOLD THOSE STRETCHES FOR AT LEAST THIRTY SECONDS SO THAT IT GIVES YOUR TIE YOUR BODY TIME TO REALLY LENGTHEN
gdENWgq54iI_14 0 AND THEN ANOTHER GREAT WAY TO GET FLEXIBLE AND LIMBER IS CHECK OUT A YOGA CLASS
gdENWgq54iI_15 0 YOU'RE GOING TO REALLY FOCUS ON YOUR BREATHING AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET NICE AND LONG AND LEAN IN A YOGA CLASS AND THEN THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GOING TO BECOME FLEXIBLE
gdENWgq54iI_16 0 NOW REMEMBER STRETCH THROUGHOUT THE DAY

gdENWgq54iI_18 0 WHEN YOU'RE SITTING AT YOUR DESK JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND JUST GO THROUGH YOUR BODY THIRTY SECONDS EACH AND YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY
gdENWgq54iI_19 0 I'M CAROL ANN WITH STUDIO GROUP X AND LET'S STRETCH EVERYBODY
gWa4CfhEvN8_1 0 ALRIGHT NOW IT'S TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHEN TO TAKE THE WINE WHEN IS IT READY TO PUT IN THE BOTTLES AND POSSIBLY EVEN TAKE A TASTE AND SEE IF IT'S READY
gWa4CfhEvN8_2 0 SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN THE WINE IS WHEN YOU START A BOTTLE OF WINE THERE'S GOING TO BE A BUBBLING EFFECT
gWa4CfhEvN8_3 0 AND THIS WINE'S BEEN WORKING FOR AWHILE BUT THIS BOTTLE OF WINE STILL HAS BUBBLES THAT ARE BUBBLING UP CONSTANTLY
gWa4CfhEvN8_4 0 AND IT'S A VISUAL THING YOU CAN SEE THEM
gWa4CfhEvN8_5 0 WHEN YOU FIRST START UP A WINE IT'S BUBBLING REALLY FAST SO YOU WILL YOU WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR BECAUSE WHEN IT STOPS BUBBLING AND IT'S CLEAR AS YOU CAN SEE WITH THIS WINE HERE
gWa4CfhEvN8_6 0 YOU CAN SEE LIGHT GOING THROUGH IT AND VERY CLEAR
gWa4CfhEvN8_7 0 IF YOU HOLD UP THIS WINE HERE YOU CAN SEE IT'S STILL CLOUDY AND IT'S NOT READY YET
gWa4CfhEvN8_8 0 AND IN THIS PARTICULAR WINE HERE THERE WASN'T THERE WAS MORE YEAST THAN THERE WAS SUGAR AND THE YEAST PLAYED OUT THE SUGAR
gWa4CfhEvN8_9 0 IF IT WAS STILL BUBBLING AND WAS REAL SWEET WINE THEN YOU PUT TOO MUCH SUGAR IN IT AND IT PLAYED OUT THE YEAST
gWa4CfhEvN8_10 0 SO YOU'VE GOT TO THERE'S A FINE LINE BETWEEN YEAST AND SUGAR SO THAT YOU DON'T PLAY ONE OUT BEFORE THE WINE'S READY
gWa4CfhEvN8_11 0 SO IN THIS CASE RIGHT HERE WITH THIS BLUEBERRY PEACH WINE IT'S CLEAR IT'S NOT BUBBLING ANYMORE SO IT'S READY TO TAKE AND BOTTLE
gnHbeZIq5nU_1 0 ALVIN DEDEAUX OKAY
gnHbeZIq5nU_2 0 WE'RE SHOOTING OUR LINE OUT NOW AND THEN WHAT YOU MIGHT NOTICE IS THAT WE HAVE TO RETRIEVE THE LINE SOMEHOW
gnHbeZIq5nU_3 0 THAT'S CALLED STRIPING THE LINE
gnHbeZIq5nU_4 0 IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH TAKING YOUR CLOTHES OFF
gnHbeZIq5nU_5 0 STRIPING IT JUST MEANS PULLING THE LINE BACK IN AND THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GOING TO RETRIEVE MOST OF THE TIME WHEN YOU'RE FLY FISHING
gnHbeZIq5nU_6 0 THE REEL WILL NOT COME INTO PLAY A LOT OF THE TIME UNLESS YOU HOOK A REALLY BIG FISH AND IT PULLS ALL YOUR SLACK OUT THAT YOU HAVE TRAPPED HERE UNDER YOUR FINGER AND THEN HE'LL GET ON THE REEL
gnHbeZIq5nU_7 0 MOST OF THE TIME WHEN WE'RE FLY-FISHING WE'RE GOING TO DO MOST OF OUR RETRIEVING LIKE THIS BY STRIPING THE LINE WHETHER WE'RE STRIPING THE LINE TO RETRIEVE THE FLY OR TO PICK UP SLACK
gnHbeZIq5nU_8 0 OR IF WE HOOK A FISH MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IF YOU'VE GOT SOME SLACK HERE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS CLAMP DOWN THERE AND STRIP THE LINE TO RETRIEVE IT
gnHbeZIq5nU_9 0 YOU CAN STRIP LINE AND RETRIEVE MUCH FASTER THAN YOU CAN BY REELING
gnHbeZIq5nU_10 0 I CAN PULL IN THREE OR FOUR FEET OF LINE PRETTY QUICKLY THIS WAY WHEREAS BY IF I WAS TRYING TO REEL IT IN WITH THE REEL I'D HAVE TO DO SEVERAL CRANKS TO GET THAT LINE IN
gnHbeZIq5nU_11 0 SO STRIPING THE LINE IS VERY IMPORTANT
gnHbeZIq5nU_12 0 SO WHETHER YOU'RE CASTING OR YOU JUST WANT TO PULL YOUR LINE BACK IN AFTER YOU SHOT IT OUT TO MAKE THE NEXT CAST OR WHETHER YOU'VE ACTUALLY HOOKED THE FISH AND YOU WANT TO TRY TO RETRIEVE THAT LINE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN THIS IS WHAT WE CALL STRIPING LINE RIGHT HERE

GrNLTXAatQ4_2 0 ONE THING TO CONSIDER IS WHETHER YOU WANT MORE OF A STATION STYLE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE LAID BACK OR IF YOU WANT TO DO THE TRADITIONAL PLATED DINNER
GrNLTXAatQ4_3 0 I LIKE TO INCORPORATE THE STATIONS INTO THE ASIAN THEMED RECEPTION BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF FUN THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH ACTION STATIONS
GrNLTXAatQ4_4 0 FOR INSTANCE YOU CAN HAVE DIFFERENT STATIONS THROUGHOUT THE ROOM AND YOU CAN SET THEM UP WITH THE GUESTS SEATED AROUND THEM OR YOU CAN DO YOUR TRADITIONAL GUEST TABLES
GrNLTXAatQ4_5 0 ONE STATION THAT I LIKE THE MOST IS THE NOODLE LOUNGE WHICH YOU KNOW YOU HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF NOODLES AND THE CHEF MIXES DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS IN THOSE TO MAKE UP YOUR OWN NOODLE CONCOCTION
GrNLTXAatQ4_6 0 ANOTHER FUN STATION IS A SUSHI BAR
GrNLTXAatQ4_7 0 YOU CAN HAVE ACTUALLY BRING IN A SUSHI ROLLER AND HAVE THEM ROLLING SUSHI AS YOUR GUESTS ARE EATING AND GOING THROUGH THE BUFFET
GrNLTXAatQ4_8 0 ANOTHER OPTION IS THAT YOU CAN DO THE MOO SHU DUCK STATION AND WHICH IS FUN AND JUST SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT IS NOT USUALLY OFFERED AT WEDDING RECEPTIONS
GrNLTXAatQ4_9 0 THERE IS ALSO IF YOU WANTED TO DO A PLATED DINNER YOU COULD START OFF YOUR APPETIZER OF COURSE WITH SPRING ROLLS OR DO YOUR JUST SUSHI PRESENTATION AND SERVE IT FAMILY STYLE AND THEN YOU CAN OFFER SOME DIFFERENT SAUCES TO ACCOMPANY THAT
GrNLTXAatQ4_10 0 AND FOR YOUR ENTREE YOU CAN CARRY THAT THEME AS WELL
GrNLTXAatQ4_11 0 SO THERE ARE JUST SOME IDEAS ON HOW TO CHOOSE AND WHAT TO CHOOSE FOR YOUR ASIAN INSPIRED RECEPTION MENU
-GA4WVLHI20_1 0 ALRIGHT NOW WE'RE READY TO START WITH THE BODY OF OUR LADYBUG THAT WE HAVE HERE
-GA4WVLHI20_2 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR PIECE OF BLACK FELT AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO WANT TO FOLD IT IN HALF MEET YOUR ENDS UP
-GA4WVLHI20_3 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR PEN OR PENCIL AND YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DRAW A CIRCLE ABOUT THE SIZE OF YOUR PALM FOR THE BODY OF YOUR BEAN BAG FOR YOUR LADYBUG
-GA4WVLHI20_4 0 AND YOU WANT TO PRESS DOWN HARD ENOUGH WHERE YOU CAN SEE THAT BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO SEE YOUR PEN-WRITING ON THE BLACK FELT
-GA4WVLHI20_5 0 ONCE YOU'VE MADE THAT CIRCLE AT THE TOP YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A SMALLER HALF-CIRCLE AND THAT IS GOING TO BE THE HEAD OF YOUR LADYBUG
-GA4WVLHI20_6 0 NOW OFF TO THE SIDE HERE YOU WANT TO DRAW TWO NICKEL-SIZE CIRCLES AS WELL
-GA4WVLHI20_7 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE USING THOSE LATER FOR THE SPOTS ON OUR LADYBUG
-GA4WVLHI20_8 0 SO ONCE YOU HAVE THOSE DRAWN YOU CAN START TO CUT THOSE OUT
-GA4WVLHI20_9 0 AND IT'S GOING TO CREATE BOTH A TOP AND A BOTTOM FOR THE BODY OF YOUR LADYBUG
-GA4WVLHI20_10 0 MAKE SURE NOT TO CUT HIS HEAD OFF
-GA4WVLHI20_11 0 WANT TO GET THAT HALF-CIRCLE-SIZE UP THERE
-GA4WVLHI20_12 0 AND WE OPEN IT UP IT'S GOING TO BE CONNECTED
-GA4WVLHI20_13 0 NOW YOU HAVE THE BODY OF YOUR LADYBUG
gzHnaTpBgv4_1 0 SOME OF THE COMMON MISTAKES THAT PEOPLE MAKE WHILE THEY'RE LEARNING HOW TO FAKIE HEEL FLIP ARE USUALLY JUST BEING COMFORTABLE ROLLING IN THE FAKIE POSITION
gzHnaTpBgv4_2 0 YOU DON'T SPEND AS MUCH TIME ROLLING FAKIE AS YOU DO ROLLING FORWARD SO IT REQUIRES A LITTLE MORE THOUGHT TO BE PREPARED TO ROLL FAKIE
gzHnaTpBgv4_3 0 ONE OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE USUALLY HAVE IS THEY DON'T PUT ENOUGH WEIGHT OVER THE FRONT OF THE BOARD
gzHnaTpBgv4_4 0 WHAT THIS DOES IS IT REPLACES THE MOMENTUM THAT YOU FEEL WHEN YOU'RE HEADED TOWARDS THE TAIL
gzHnaTpBgv4_5 0 WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS LEAN WHILE YOU DO THE FAKIE OLLIE LEAN FORWARD TO COMPENSATE AND BALANCE OUT THE TRICK
gzHnaTpBgv4_6 0 WHAT PEOPLE USUALLY DON'T DO IS WHILE THEY'RE ROLLING BACKWARDS THEY TEND TO LEAN BACK THIS WAY ONCE THEY'VE OLLIED AND HEEL FLIP AND KEEP GOING IN THIS POSITION
gzHnaTpBgv4_7 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO TO FIX THAT IS YOU WANT TO SET UP IN YOUR HEEL FLIP POSITION HIT THE TAIL AND THEN REPLACE THE WEIGHT ON THE FRONT SIDE OF IT SO THAT YOUR WEIGHT IS BALANCED EVENLY AND IT ENDS UP FLIPPING STRAIGHT AND YOU'RE ABLE TO ROLL AWAY
gzHnaTpBgv4_8 0 ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT YOU MAY HAVE LEARNING FAKIE HEEL FLIPS IS THAT IT JUST DOESN'T FLIP ENOUGH
gzHnaTpBgv4_9 0 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO THEN IS POSSIBLY ADJUST YOUR FOOT PLACEMENT BY HANGING YOUR TOE A LITTLE MORE OFF THE BOARD
gzHnaTpBgv4_10 0 THIS IS A VERY COMMON MISTAKE
gzHnaTpBgv4_11 0 WHAT YOU'LL WANT TO DO IS JUST TEST WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU AT THE SPEED THAT YOU'RE ROLLING
gzHnaTpBgv4_12 0 HAVE YOUR BACK FOOT ON THE BACK CORNER YOUR FOOT OVER HERE THAT'S HOW YOU BALANCE THE HEEL FLIP AND THE OLLIE AND THEN REMEMBER TO LEAN FORWARD SO THAT YOU DON'T LEAN TOO FAR BACK AND KICK AND DON'T HAVE IT LAND UNDERNEATH YOU AND THAT'LL HELP YOU LEARN HOW TO HEEL FLIP FAKIE
ggx79z62v60_1 0 HI THIS IS JOHN STEWART AND THIS IS HOW TO STAKE OUT A TENT ONCE YOU'VE SET IT UP
ggx79z62v60_2 0 THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES OF STAKES AND THEY ALL COME PLAY KEY ROLES WHEN SETTING UP TENTS IN DIFFERENT AREAS
ggx79z62v60_3 0 FIRST ONE I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS JUST NORMAL OLD CAMPING OUT IN THE WOODS
ggx79z62v60_4 0 MOST OF THE TIME YOU'VE GOING TO HAVE A MOIST GROUND
ggx79z62v60_5 0 THIS IS WHEN YOU CAN TAKE AND USE A REAL LIGHT-WEIGHT STAKE A METAL ONE A REAL LIGHT-WEIGHT PLASTIC
ggx79z62v60_6 0 SOMETHING THAT'S JUST GOING TO GET IN THE GROUND AND HOLD YOUR TENT DOWN IN CASE THERE'S STRONG WINDS OR RAIN ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR RAIN FLOWING
ggx79z62v60_7 0 IF YOU'RE OUT IN A SANDY AREA OR A SNOWY AREA THEY HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A SNOW STAKE OR A SAND STAKE
ggx79z62v60_8 0 WHAT THESE ARE ARE THESE ARE POUCHES THAT YOU FILL UP WITH SNOW OR SAND AND THEN YOU JUST PULL THEM TIGHT AND CLIP THEM ONTO THE TENT TO WHERE IT HOLDS AND IT WEIGHS DOWN YOUR TENT
ggx79z62v60_9 0 OTHER THINGS THAT WORK IN SNOW AND SAND ARE BIGGER STAKES MOST OF THE TIME THEY COME IN A T-SHAPED TO WHERE THEY GO IN AND THEY'VE GOT A BIG BLADE THAT KEEPS THEM FROM PULLING AGAINST THE TENT
ggx79z62v60_10 0 THESE WORK REALLY WELL ONCE YOU GET INTO THE LIKE TWELVE TO FOURTEEN INCH SIZE STAKES
ggx79z62v60_11 0 SO THAT'S SOME OF THE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF STAKES THAT YOU CAN USE
ggx79z62v60_12 0 YOU CAN EASILY REPAIR YOUR STAKES BY DUCT TAPING THEM OR YOU CAN GO IN AND JUST FIND A HARD WOOD SHARPEN ONE END OF IT AND USE THAT AS A STAKE THAT'S AN EASIER REPLACEMENT
ggx79z62v60_13 0 WHEN YOU DO STAKE OUT YOUR TENT YOU WANT TO PUT THEM IN AT A FORTY-FIVE DEGREE ANGLE INTO THE GROUND AND DON'T BEAT THEM ALL THE WAY INTO THE GROUND IT'S A PAIN IN THE BUTT TO THEN GET THEM OUT
ggx79z62v60_14 0 AND THIS IS HOW TO STAKE OUT YOUR TENT WHEN SETTING UP YOUR TENT
HB1swYQEHB8_2 0 FOLKS IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE MUSIC VIDEOS
HB1swYQEHB8_3 0 ALRIGHT SO FIRST OF ALL YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO CONSULT WITH A BAND
HB1swYQEHB8_4 0 FIND OUT YOU KNOW WHAT TYPE OF VIDEO THEY WANT TO SEE COME TOGETHER HERE
HB1swYQEHB8_5 0 YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE IDEAS PREPARED WHEN YOU SIT DOWN WITH THEM
HB1swYQEHB8_6 0 HAVING LISTENED TO THE SONG IF THEY WANT TO SHOOT A VIDEO TOO
HB1swYQEHB8_7 0 MAKE SURE YOU COME TO THE TABLE WITH AT LEAST TWO OR THREE IDEAS ON THE VIDEO CONCEPT
HB1swYQEHB8_8 0 WHETHER IT WOULD BE THE VISUAL STYLE OR MAYBE A STORY THAT YOU WANT TO TIE IN WITH
HB1swYQEHB8_9 0 COME TO THE TABLE WITH THEM AND ALSO MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE THEY'RE COLLABORATING IN THE STORY TELLING PROCESS
HB1swYQEHB8_10 0 THEY MIGHT HAVE AN IDEA ALREADY LAID OUT
HB1swYQEHB8_11 0 SO WORK WITH THEM COLLABORATE FIND A VISUAL INTERPRETATION OF THE SONG
HB1swYQEHB8_12 0 THAT EVERYONE'S HAPPY WITH
HB1swYQEHB8_13 0 AFTER THAT GET EVERY ALL THE PREPRODUCTION WORK DONE
HB1swYQEHB8_14 0 AND SET A DATE TO SHOOT
HB1swYQEHB8_15 0 WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY SHOOTING A MUSIC VIDEO YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GET A LOT OF COVERAGE OF THE BAND PLAYING
HB1swYQEHB8_16 0 IF THE VIDEO HAS A PERFORMANCE BIT TO IT
HB1swYQEHB8_17 0 WHERE THE BAD YOU KNOW IS IN THE SHOTS YOU KNOW PLAYING THE SONGS
HB1swYQEHB8_18 0 SINGING WHATEVER YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET A LOT OF COVERAGE OF THIS
HB1swYQEHB8_19 0 BECAUSE THIS WILL BE THE STUFF THAT YOU ALL WILL GO BACK TO AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN
HB1swYQEHB8_20 0 WE'RE ASSUMING THAT THIS VIDEO HAS SOME OTHER COMPONENT TO IT AS WELL
HB1swYQEHB8_21 0 LIKE MAYBE A STORY LINE THAT YOU CUT BACK TO
HB1swYQEHB8_22 0 IT ACTUALLY HAS A NARRATIVE THREAD TOO
HB1swYQEHB8_23 0 SO CALLING BACK TO THE BAND IS YOUR SAFETY NET
HB1swYQEHB8_24 0 GET A LOT OF REALLY GREAT SHOTS THAT THE BAND FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT ANGLES
HB1swYQEHB8_25 0 COVER THEM WELL
HB1swYQEHB8_26 0 THE NEXT STEP IF YOU'RE SHOOTING A STORY PORTION OF THE VIDEO
HB1swYQEHB8_27 0 THE THING THAT'S GREAT ABOUT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY DIALOG IS NOT GOING TO BE A FACTOR
HB1swYQEHB8_28 0 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE WORRIED ABOUT RECORDING ANY SOUND ON THE LOCATION
HB1swYQEHB8_29 0 SO REALLY FEEL FREE TO EXPLORE THE VISUAL LANDSCAPE HERE
HB1swYQEHB8_30 0 BECAUSE IT'S ALL OF INDIVIDUALS ESSENTIALLY
HB1swYQEHB8_31 0 A MUSIC VIDEO IS BASICALLY A SILENT FILM
HB1swYQEHB8_32 0 BECAUSE THE SONG IS THE DRIVING FORCE OF IT
HB1swYQEHB8_33 0 AND OBVIOUSLY CREATES THE ENERGY
HB1swYQEHB8_34 0 BUT THE ACTORS THEMSELVES IN THE VIDEO REALLY WON'T HAVE ANY TALKING TO DO
HB1swYQEHB8_35 0 SO MAKE SURE THAT THE STORY MOVES THAT IT FEELS YOU KNOW THERE'S A CERTAIN LEVEL OF EXCITEMENT TO IT
HB1swYQEHB8_36 0 THAT THERE'S A YOU CAN HOOK THEM EARLY ON WITH A CONCEPT
HB1swYQEHB8_37 0 AND YEAH GET A LOT OF COVERAGE IN THIS AS WELL
HB1swYQEHB8_38 0 BASICALLY FEEL FREE TO EXPLORE AND GET CREATIVE VISUALLY
HB1swYQEHB8_39 0 BECAUSE A MUSIC VIDEO IS ESSENTIALLY A VISUAL CALLING CARD FOR A BAND
HB1swYQEHB8_40 0 THEN AS YOU'RE EDITING IT TOGETHER
HB1swYQEHB8_41 0 MAKE SURE THAT THE MOVEMENT OF THE VIDEO
HB1swYQEHB8_42 0 AND PARTICULARLY THE CUTS MATCH THE RHYTHM OF THE SONG ITSELF
HB1swYQEHB8_43 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE CUTS ALL SPREAD
HB1swYQEHB8_44 0 IT CAN FEEL OUT OF SYNC WITH THE RHYTHM AND THE TEMPO OF THE SONG
HB1swYQEHB8_45 0 ONCE THAT'S ALL DONE JUST SUBMIT TO THE BAND FOR FINAL APPROVAL
HB1swYQEHB8_46 0 AND HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE JUST MADE YOURSELF A TOP NOTCH SUCCESSFUL MUSIC VIDEO
h04oX5qhBCY_1 0 SERGEANT NELSON YES
h04oX5qhBCY_2 0 IF THERE IS ANY TIPS I CAN GIVE YOU IS IN YOUR CAREER AS BEING A POLICE OFFICER GET TO WHERE YOU GET USED TO LISTENING TO PEOPLE CAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO DO A LOT OF LISTENING
h04oX5qhBCY_3 0 LISTENING TO THEM AND BE UNDERSTANDING WITH THAT
h04oX5qhBCY_4 0 THERE IS GOING TO BE TIMES YOU SIT AND LISTEN QUITE A BIT AND NOT TALK MUCH AT ALL SO HAVING BEEN ABLE TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE AND IS A GREAT GREAT TOOL
h04oX5qhBCY_5 0 AND ALSO AS FAR AS TRYING TO REASON WITH PEOPLE CAUSE YOU WANT TO YOU'RE GOING TO MEET WITH PEOPLE AND IF YOU CAN TALK TO PEOPLE AND CALM THEM DOWN YOU CAN BE PRETTY SUCCESSFUL IN YOUR CAREER
h04oX5qhBCY_6 0 SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME WHEN I FIRST BECOME AN OFFICER I WAS I GUESS KIND OF SHY YOU WOULD SAY BUT THROUGH THE DIFFERENT JOBS I'VE DONE COMMUNITY SPEAKING WAS PRETTY TERRIBLE
h04oX5qhBCY_7 0 I WAS SCARED TO DEATH OF THAT
h04oX5qhBCY_8 0 NOW IT'S NOT THE FAVORITE MOST FAVORITE THING TO DO BUT I FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT
h04oX5qhBCY_9 0 AND WITH THAT YOU CAN YOU DON'T STRESS OUT AS MUCH AND IT MAKES YOUR JOB A LOT EASIER
h04oX5qhBCY_10 0 AND SO IF YOU ARE GOOD AT COMMUNITY SPEAKING NOT AFRAID OF IT YOU'LL DO WELL WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT
h04oX5qhBCY_11 0 IF IT'S SOMETHING YOU ARE SCARED OF MAYBE TAKE A CLASS ON SPEAKING OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE AND JUST GETTING UP AND DOING IT
h04oX5qhBCY_12 0 SAME WITH IF YOU ARE A PROFESSIONAL WELDER THE MORE YOU WELD THE BETTER YOU GET THE MORE COMFORTABLE YOU GET WITH IT
h04oX5qhBCY_13 0 IT'S KIND OF ROUGH AT FIRST BUT YOU JUST JUMP IN AND YOU GO AND IT'S FUN AND ENJOY IT
h04oX5qhBCY_14 0 SOME OF THE ANOTHER TIP IS THE PHYSICAL FITNESS PART OF IT
h04oX5qhBCY_15 0 AS AN OFFICER YOU NEED TO BE PHYSICALLY FIT
h04oX5qhBCY_16 0 SO IF YOU GO AND GET THING ABOUT GETTING IN THE ACADEMY START RUNNING START WHETHER IT'S LIFTING OR PUSH UPS SIT UPS JUST GET INTO SHAPE BECAUSE OUR MAIN GOAL IS TO IS THAT OFFICERS GO HOME AND IF YOU ARE IN SHAPE THAT'S A BETTER RISK THAT YOU ARE GOING TO GO HOME OR A BETTER CHANCE THAT YOU'RE GOING HOME AND NOT HAVE TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL OR THINGS LIKE THAT
h04oX5qhBCY_17 0 SO STAYING INTO SHAPE IS A HUGE THING
h04oX5qhBCY_18 0 AND YOU ARE GOING IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF GETTING HURT OR WHATEVER IT IS ON THAT YOU CAN GET HURT RIDING YOUR BIKE
h04oX5qhBCY_19 0 IT'S PROBABLY NO DIFFERENT IT'S A LITTLE HIGHER RISK BUT YOU HAVE YOUR PRECAUTIONS YOU HAVE YOUR BULLET PROOF VEST AND THINGS LIKE THAT
h04oX5qhBCY_20 0 BUT IT'S NO WORSE THEN WE ARE TRAINED AT WHAT WE DO AND IT'S NO WORSE THEN OTHER PROFESSIONS
h04oX5qhBCY_21 0 YOU CAN GET HURT IN SO IF THAT IS A BIG ISSUE DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT IF YOU GET TRAINED IN THE THINGS AND EVERYBODY IS THERE TO BACK EVERYBODY UP AND HOPEFULLY YOU NEVER GET HURT BUT YOU CAN GET HURT IN ANY PROFESSION
g9bQ72e7ZMo_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO VENTURE INTO WHAT I WOULD CALL MY PERFORMANCE BITS
g9bQ72e7ZMo_2 0 I WOULD KEEP A BIT SIMILAR TO THIS HANGING UP IN MY TACK ROOM READY FOR WHAT I CALL THE DRESS REHEARSAL
g9bQ72e7ZMo_3 0 IF I HAVE A PERFORMANCE HORSE AND WE'RE GETTING READY TO COMPETE AT A HIGH LEVEL IT'S QUITE LIKELY THAT I'M GOING TO START TO SWITCH THAT HORSE INTO WHAT'S CONSIDERED YOUR TRADITIONAL KIND OF PORT STYLE LEVERAGE BIT
g9bQ72e7ZMo_4 0 THE PORT IS THIS RAISED AREA
g9bQ72e7ZMo_5 0 THIS ONE'S RATHER HIGH SOMEWHAT ASSERTIVE
g9bQ72e7ZMo_6 0 YOU MIGHT CONSIDER THIS A VERY STRONG BIT
g9bQ72e7ZMo_7 0 WE HAVE SAYINGS THAT EVEN THE RIGHT BIT IN THE WRONG HANDS CAN BE A PROBLEM TO THE HORSE
g9bQ72e7ZMo_8 0 THIS COULD BE CONSIDERED PERHAPS THE WRONG BIT IF IT WERE IN THE WRONG HANDS
g9bQ72e7ZMo_9 0 BUT IN THE CORRECT HANDS A RIDER WHO'S VERY ACCOMPLISHED TRAINED IN THE PRESENTATION OF A GOOD PERFORMANCE HORSE THIS IS THE KIND OF BIT THAT WILL BRING YOU TO THE DRESS REHEARSAL THAT WILL ULTIMATELY TAKE YOU TO THE STAGE
g9bQ72e7ZMo_10 0 I USE THIS WHEN I'M TRAINING A HORSE TRYING TO CONVERT FROM THE SNAFFLES AND THE SHANK SNAFFLES TO MOVE ON TO WHAT WE WOULD ALSO USE THEN WHEN WE GET TO THAT MORE HIGHLY POLISHED FANCY SILVER SORT OF BIT THAT WE WOULD USE THAT HAS THE SAME MECHANISM AS MY TRAINING BIT
g9bQ72e7ZMo_11 0 BUT I RESERVE THIS POLISH IT UP KEEP IT TO THE SIDE FOR WHEN WE GO TO THE SHOWS
g9bQ72e7ZMo_12 0 A BIT LIKE THIS MIGHT BE SEEN IN ALL KINDS OF DISCIPLINES PARTICULARLY ON HORSES THAT ARE OVER FIVE YEARS OLD
g9bQ72e7ZMo_13 0 UNDER FIVE YEARS OLD WE CONSIDER THEM JUNIOR HORSES AND THEY CAN PERFORM AT ALL LEVELS TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE IN THEIR SNAFFLE BITS TYPICALLY YOUR LOOSE RING D RINGS
g9bQ72e7ZMo_14 0 BUT ONCE THEY GET TO BE OF THE SENIOR OR AGED HORSES THEY MUST SHOW AND PERFORM IN A CURB OR LEVERAGE BIT
g9bQ72e7ZMo_15 0 SO WE TYPICALLY GO TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT CREATES A VERY ASSERTIVE EASY TO PERFORM PUTTING THEM IN THAT COLLECTED WHAT WE CALL HOOKED IN THE BRIDLE APPEARANCE
g9bQ72e7ZMo_16 0 I WOULDN'T WANT TO USE THIS IN TRAINING
g9bQ72e7ZMo_17 0 IT WOULD TAKE AWAY THE SENSITIVITY OVER TIME
g9bQ72e7ZMo_18 0 BUT IN USED IN A PERFORMANCE HORSE THIS IS GOING TO PUT ENOUGH PRESSURE TO THE ROOF OF THEIR MOUTH THAT WITH VERY LITTLE HAND MOVEMENT THIS BIT IS GOING TO PUT THEM RIGHT WHERE I NEED THEM WITHOUT ANY HAND MOVEMENT ON MY PART
HeEjPFgJ5rc_2 0 I'M KAREN FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
HeEjPFgJ5rc_3 0 TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A SIMPLE STUFFED ANIMAL
HeEjPFgJ5rc_4 0 THIS IS A GREAT BEGINNER'S PROJECT
HeEjPFgJ5rc_5 0 THESE DOGGIES WERE ACTUALLY MADE BY CHILDREN SEVEN YEARS AND ELEVEN YEARS OLD
HeEjPFgJ5rc_6 0 IT'S A GREAT PROJECT IT CAN BE MADE COMPLETELY BY HAND
HeEjPFgJ5rc_7 0 IT HAS ONLY THREE SIMPLE PIECES IN THE PATTERN AND IT'S MADE WITH THIS NICE FLEECY FABRIC THAT YOU A LOT IN FABRIC STORES AND IT DOESN'T HAVE HEAVY FUR SO IT'S VERY EASY TO WORK WITH
HeEjPFgJ5rc_8 0 IT'S VERY EASY TO SEW FOR CHILDREN
HeEjPFgJ5rc_9 0 THE OTHER THINGS WE'LL BE USING IS A NUMBER EIGHT IN EMBROIDERY THREAD OR A THREAD FOR DOING CROCHET TWO COLORS OF EMBROIDERY FLOSS
HeEjPFgJ5rc_10 0 BLACK TO DO THE NOSE AND RED TO DO THE LITTLE TONGUE
HeEjPFgJ5rc_11 0 YOU ONLY NEED A LITTLE BIT
HeEjPFgJ5rc_12 0 SOME NEEDLES THAT HAVE A FAIRLY BIG HOLE
HeEjPFgJ5rc_13 0 EMBROIDERY NEEDLES ARE GOOD TO ACCOMMODATE THE LARGER THREADS
HeEjPFgJ5rc_14 0 SOME PINS ARE GREAT FOR HOLDING THINGS IN PLACE
HeEjPFgJ5rc_15 0 A NEEDLE THREADER IS GOOD TO HAVE BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARY AND MAYBE SOME BUTTONS IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS
HeEjPFgJ5rc_16 0 MAKE A LITTLE DOGGY TAG OR USE BUTTONS FOR THE EYES
HeEjPFgJ5rc_17 0 YOU CAN MAKE IT WITHOUT THE BUTTONS BY JUST EMBROIDERING THE EYES
HeEjPFgJ5rc_18 0 YOU SHOULD HAVE A GOOD SHARP PAIR OF SCISSORS AND IT'S NICE TO HAVE A SMALL PAIR OF SCISSORS FOR DOING LITTLE TRIMMING THREADS AND SMALL THINGS
HeEjPFgJ5rc_19 0 THEN OF COURSE YOU NEED THE STUFFING
HeEjPFgJ5rc_20 0 THIS IS POLYFIBER FILL 100 %PERCENT POLYESTER AND YOU CAN FIND THAT IN CRAFT STORES OR FABRIC STORES
HeEjPFgJ5rc_21 0 I THINK THAT'S EVERYTHING
HeEjPFgJ5rc_22 0 NOW LET'S GET STARTED
g4SDvkEgjRQ_1 0 OKAY IT'S BEEN ABOUT THREE MINUTES SO WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PULL OUR COCONUT OUT
g4SDvkEgjRQ_2 0 IT'S GOING TO BE A NICE BROWN COLOR AND WE'LL SET THAT ASIDE
g4SDvkEgjRQ_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR VEGETABLE STOCK AND WE MIGHT NEED THAT FOR LATER SO WE'RE GOING TO REMOVE THAT
g4SDvkEgjRQ_4 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO CUT OFF ABOUT A TABLESPOON OF BUTTER AND JUST GENTLY MELT THAT
g4SDvkEgjRQ_5 0 I'M GOING TO FINISH CUTTING THE DILL
g4SDvkEgjRQ_6 0 WE KIND OF WANT TO GO OVER THAT BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES YOU GET A LOT OF STEMS WHERE THERE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THERE ARE ANY
g4SDvkEgjRQ_7 0 ALRIGHT WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK TO OUR CUCUMBERS AND WE'RE GOING TO DRAIN OUT THE LIQUID
g4SDvkEgjRQ_8 0 WE'RE GOING TO SPRINKLE THIS OUR DILL OUR SCALLIONS OUR ONION AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT ABOUT A HALF A TEASPOON OF WHITE PEPPER OVER THE TOP
g4SDvkEgjRQ_9 0 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR PARTIALLY MELTED BUTTER AND WE'LL GIVE IT A QUICK STIR
g4SDvkEgjRQ_10 0 IF THE BUTTER'S NOT MELTED ALL THE WAY WE'RE ABOUT TO BAKE THIS SO THAT WILL BE FINE
g4SDvkEgjRQ_11 0 WE'RE REALLY JUST STIRRING THIS UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DILL AND THE WHITE PEPPER ARE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED AND THAT OUR CUCUMBERS ARE ALL CUT
g4SDvkEgjRQ_12 0 AND THEN WE'LL PUT THIS IN THE OVEN AND WE'LL BAKE IT FOR ABOUT TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES
gTeJmkN3tPY_1 0 HI I'M HERE TO SHOW YOU HOW TO LOCATE AND CHECK YOUR OIL ON YOUR MOTORCYCLE
gTeJmkN3tPY_2 0 ON EACH MOTORCYCLE YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO REFERENCE YOUR MANUAL FAR AS WHERE YOUR OIL INSPECTION WINDOW OR DIPSTICK IS LOCATED
gTeJmkN3tPY_3 0 AND OF COURSE THE QUANTITY AND WHAT PARTICULAR TYPE OF OIL YOUR BIKE REQUIRES
gTeJmkN3tPY_4 0 ON THIS MOTORCYCLE BEING A HONDA SHADOW IT DOES HAVE A DIPSTICK RIGHT HERE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE MOTORCYCLE
gTeJmkN3tPY_5 0 AND BEFORE I CHECK THIS BIKE AND IT'S A GOOD IDEA WITH ANY BIKE IS YOU WANT TO START THE BIKE WARM IT UP SHUT IT OFF LET IT SIT FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES
gTeJmkN3tPY_6 0 AND I'M GOING TO GET THIS MOTORCYCLE COMPLETELY UPRIGHT SO YOU CAN HAVE A FRIEND SIT ON THE MOTORCYCLE OR IF YOU HAVE A MOTORCYCLE STAND THAT WILL KEEP THE BIKE UPRIGHT THAT WILL ALWAYS GIVE YOU A MORE ACCURATE READING
gTeJmkN3tPY_7 0 SIMPLY GOING TO REMOVE THE DIPSTICK GOING TO TAKE A RAG AND I'M GOING TO WIPE IT AND I DO NOT HAVE TO THREAD THE DIPSTICK BACK INTO THIS ENGINE CASE
gTeJmkN3tPY_8 0 I JUST HAVE TO LET IT SIT ON TOP
gTeJmkN3tPY_9 0 I'M GOING TO REMOVE IT I'M GOING TO REFERENCE MY MARKS AND NOTE THAT I HAVE OIL IN BETWEEN THE MARKS AND KNOW THAT WE'RE GOOD TO GO AND I'M GOING TO PUT IT BACK IN
gTeJmkN3tPY_10 0 THREAD IT IN HAND TIGHT
gTeJmkN3tPY_11 0 BUT AGAIN EACH MOTORCYCLE BEING DIFFERENT SOME HAVE SIGHT WINDOW SOME HAVE A DIPSTICK SOME HAVE A DRAIN AND MEASURE
gTeJmkN3tPY_12 0 YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO REFERENCE YOUR MANUAL AND VERIFY THAT YOU'RE DOING IT CORRECTLY
G6BlRfRrNt8_1 0 OKAY THIS IS CALLED THE ALLEY RALLY SO WE'RE GOING TO USE THE DOUBLES ALLEY AS OUR PRACTICE ZONE
G6BlRfRrNt8_2 0 SO I'M JUST GOING TO HIT THE BALL SOFTLY TO DARREN AND HE'S GOING TO HIT IT SOFTLY BACK TO ME
G6BlRfRrNt8_3 0 SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST GOING TO FOCUS ON KEEPING IT IN PLAY IN BETWEEN THE TWO LINES OF THE DOUBLES ALLEY
G6BlRfRrNt8_4 0 THIS WILL TEACH YOU HOW TO KEEP THE BALL IN PLAY AND TO HIT YOUR TARGETS
G6BlRfRrNt8_5 0 SO YOU SEE WE HAVE A VERY SMALL RELATIVELY SMALL TARGET AND WE KEEP IT IN PLAY
G6BlRfRrNt8_6 0 YOU CAN HIT BOTH SIDES TO DARREN IF YOU WANT TO HIT A COUPLE FOREHANDS FEEL FREE
G6BlRfRrNt8_7 0 YOU CAN INCREASE THE PACE OF THIS SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST GOING TO GET IN A NICE RHYTHM
G6BlRfRrNt8_8 0 THIS IS JUST UNDER SPIN NOTHING TOO FANCY
G6BlRfRrNt8_9 0 SEE DARREN SAVED IT THERE WITH A VOLLEY OF MY LONG SHOT
G6BlRfRrNt8_10 0 SO THAT'S THE ALLEY RALLY
G6BlRfRrNt8_11 0 NOW WE CAN START BACKING UP AND WE CAN HIT BIGGER SHOTS
G6BlRfRrNt8_12 0 OKAY SO THIS IS A REALLY GOOD DRILL
G6BlRfRrNt8_13 0 IN THE NEXT SEGMENT I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE A LITTLE MORE TOP SPIN
Hf4Qu0LuUTY_1 0 OK SO NOW WE HAVE OUR SCARECROW COMPLETELY PUT TOGETHER AND THESE ARE REALLY GREAT IN THE FALL LIKE I SAID AROUND HALLOWEEN
Hf4Qu0LuUTY_2 0 YOU CAN PUT THEM IN A CHAIR OR PUT THEM ON THE FRONT PORCH
Hf4Qu0LuUTY_3 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT WITHOUT IT FALLING ALL APART
Hf4Qu0LuUTY_4 0 YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GRAB THE BASE OF THE BODY AND THE PANTS TOGETHER AS WELL AS THE BACK OF THE NECK OF YOUR SCARECROW AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO PUT HIM IN YOUR CHAIR LET HIM SLIDE DOWN AND IF YOU HAVE HIM STUFFED PROPERLY HE'S JUST GOING TO STAND UP ON HIS OWN AND YOU HAVE YOUR HEAD PINNED ON SECURELY THAT'S GOING TO STAND UP AS WELL
Hf4Qu0LuUTY_5 0 THE LEGS ARE NICE AND FULL YOU CAN LET THEM HANG OR YOU CAN CROSS THE LEGS AND LET THAT SIT THERE
Hf4Qu0LuUTY_6 0 THAT'S ANOTHER FEATURE YOU CAN DO TO THEM
Hf4Qu0LuUTY_7 0 ONCE YOU HAVE HIM IN YOUR CHAIR YOU CAN START TO ACCESSORIZE HIM ALSO GIVE HIM A ONCE OVER MAKE SURE YOU DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING
Hf4Qu0LuUTY_8 0 IF YOU NEED TO ADD SOME MORE HAY TO HIM YOU CAN DO THAT AS WELL
Hf4Qu0LuUTY_9 0 IF YOUR SCARECROW IS STUFFED AND PUT TOGETHER CORRECTLY HE'S JUST GOING TO SIT UP ON HIS OWN AND THAT'S GOING TO BE GREAT FOR OUTSIDE FOR THE FALL SEASON
gj7Pd8TywT0_1 0 LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT JAPAN KNOCKOFFS IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT
gj7Pd8TywT0_2 0 KNOCKOFFS OF A KNOCKOFF ANYWAY SOME OF THE KNOCKOFFS LOOK REAL JAPANISH AND ONES THAT ARE REAL COMMON RIGHT NOW THAT YOU SEE EVERYWHERE DON'T BUY THEM
gj7Pd8TywT0_3 0 I LEARNED THIS ONE THE HARD WAY
gj7Pd8TywT0_4 0 NOW SINCE YOU'RE AN EXPERT ON JAPAN NOW IF YOU SAW THIS EXPERT VILLAGE WOULDN'T YOU SAY THIS IS A WONDERFUL PIECE OF JAPAN COLLECTIBLE
gj7Pd8TywT0_5 0 WOULD YOU SAY IT IS
gj7Pd8TywT0_8 0 THIS WOULD BE THIS HAS THAT BRAZIL LOOK
gj7Pd8TywT0_9 0 I COULD NAME THIS IN A SPLIT SECOND
gj7Pd8TywT0_10 0 I KNOW THE BRAZIL LOOK IT'S GOT A WAY HIGHER SHEEN IT'S MADE RIGHT NOW AND OF COURSE IT SAYS MADE IN BRAZIL WHAT A GREAT TIP-OFF
gj7Pd8TywT0_11 0 SO THESE ARE BRAND NEW THEY LOOK LIKE JAPANESE COLLECTIBLES WHEN YOU'RE STARTING OUT IN ANTIQUING YOU BUY THEM BECAUSE YOU THINK THEY ARE BUT THEY'RE NOT
gj7Pd8TywT0_12 0 HERE'S ANOTHER ONE
gj7Pd8TywT0_13 0 THIS LOOKS LIKE A JAPAN BUT IT'S A BRAZIL
gj7Pd8TywT0_14 0 SO YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO BUY THESE BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEM NOW AND THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH WORTHLESS
gj7Pd8TywT0_15 0 YOU'LL SEE THEM IN ANTIQUE MALLS PEOPLE TRYING TO SELL THEM LIKE HERE FOR TWENTY BUCKS
gj7Pd8TywT0_17 0 I WOULDN'T YOU COULDN'T PAY ME TO TAKE THIS UNLESS I HAD A FRIEND WHO HAD A SOFT SPOT FOR A PIGEON IN A BUCKET OR A BASKET

HJDfL7Og9Rc_1 0 HI I'M GARY FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AS WE SAW BEFORE THERE ARE SO MANY FUNCTIONS IN EXCEL THAT WE REALLY COULD USE A GOOD EXPLANATION OF WHAT ALL THESE FUNCTIONS DO AND EVEN SOME OF THE COMMON ONES WE MIGHT NEED SOME HELP IN UNDERSTANDING HOW THEY WORK AND WHEN WE GO AND CLICK ON THE FUNCTION KEY NEXT TO THE FORMULA BAR WE SEE A WHOLE LONG LIST OF OUR FORMULAS
HJDfL7Og9Rc_2 0 I HAVE A SMALLER LIST HERE BECAUSE IT IS SET TO SHOW ONLY THOSE RECENTLY USED BUT IF I GO AHEAD AND CLICK ON THE âALL FORMULAS' I SEE THAT THERE IS A VERY VERY LONG LIST AND IF I EVER NEED HELP IN FINDING OUT HOW THAT PARTICULAR FORMULA WORKS
HJDfL7Og9Rc_3 0 SAY AVERAGES I WOULD GO AND CLICK ON âAVERAGE' AND IT GIVES ME A SMALL EXPLANATION HERE IT'S SAYS âRETURNS THE AVERAGE WHICH IS TRANSLATED AS ARITHMETIC MEAN OF ITS ARGUMENTS WHICH CAN BE NUMBERS OR NAMES ARRAYS OR REFERENCES THAT CONTAIN NUMBERS AND SO ON
HJDfL7Og9Rc_4 0 SO IF WE NEED HELP AND ACTUALLY WANT TO SEE SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW THIS FORMULA WORKS WE CLICK ON THE HELP KEY AND WE HAVE OUR MICROSOFT EXCEL HELP WINDOW OPEN UP AND WE SEE OUR TITLE IS AVERAGE
HJDfL7Og9Rc_5 0 THAT IS OUR FORMULA THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR AND IT GIVES A MUCH MORE DETAILED EXPLANATION AND IF WE SCROLL DOWN A LITTLE BIT WE ACTUALLY SEE THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO USE THE FORMULA SO WE KNOW HOW TO WHICH SYNTAX TO PUT IN TO USE THIS FORMULA
HJDfL7Og9Rc_6 0 IN THIS CASE WE WOULD PUT EQUAL AVERAGE WHICH IS THE NAME OF THE FORMULA WE ARE LOOKING FOR TELLING TELLING EXCEL TO TAKE THE AVERAGE OF THE NUMBERS THAT APPEAR BETWEEN THESE CELLS BECAUSE WE HAVE A2 AND WE HAVE A COLON IN-BETWEEN AND THAT MEANS THROUGH A6
HJDfL7Og9Rc_7 0 THAT SERIES OF CELLS THAT GROUP OF CELLS WE WOULD BE TAKING THE AVERAGE OF ALL THE VALUES IN THAT CELL
HJDfL7Og9Rc_8 0 SO HERE IS A NICE WAY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO IN A IN EXPLAINING HOW TO USE EXCEL IT WOULDN'T BE COMPLETE IF I DIDN'T SHOW YOU HOW TO REALLY GET THIS HELP MENU BECAUSE WE ARE ALWAYS EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH EXCEL ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR HELP BECAUSE THEY FORGET HOW TO USE EACH INDIVIDUAL FORMULA WITHIN EXCEL
HJDfL7Og9Rc_9 0 SO IT IS ALWAYS IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO KNOW THAT BY A CLICK OF A BUTTON YOU CAN GET A NICE EXPLANATION AND SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW TO USE EACH TYPE OF FORMULA LISTED IN EXCEL
gFcAXCuhr_0_1 0 WE WANT TO ENJOY OUR XYLOPHONE AFTER IT'S MADE AND BECAUSE WE WANT TO ENJOY IT AND NOT HAVE IT HURT US WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF A FEW ROUGH EDGES
gFcAXCuhr_0_2 0 NOW THOSE ROUGH EDGES ARE JUST WHAT I MEAN
gFcAXCuhr_0_3 0 WHEN YOU CUT THE PIPE WITH THE PIPE CUTTER IT LEAVES A VERY SHARP EDGE AROUND THE TOP OF THE PIPE
gFcAXCuhr_0_4 0 CAN WE GET IN AND SEE THAT CLOSELY
gFcAXCuhr_0_5 0 WE CAN SEE THAT IT'S VERY SHARP ALMOST LIKE A KNIFE KIND OF LIKE A DULL KNIFE BLADE
gFcAXCuhr_0_6 0 IT'S STILL SHARP ENOUGH TO CUT US IF IT CAUGHT US AT THE RIGHT ANGLE
gFcAXCuhr_0_7 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE IS A SMALL METAL FILE AND THIS METAL FILE IS GOING TO HELP US SMOOTH OUT THOSE EDGES SO THAT IF WE HAVE ANY CHILDREN AROUND OR EVEN FOR OUR OWN SAFETY WE DON'T GET ANY CUT FINGERS FROM OUR XYLOPHONE
gFcAXCuhr_0_8 0 THAT WAY WE CAN ENJOY IT AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THE SAFETY ISSUES
gFcAXCuhr_0_9 0 SO WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE THE SHARP EDGE AND WE RUN THIS AT AN ANGLE AROUND THE WHOLE PIPE
gFcAXCuhr_0_10 0 AND WE DO THAT WITH QUITE A BIT OF OOMPH OR FORCE UNTIL WE CAN FEEL THAT THOSE EDGES ARE GONE
gFcAXCuhr_0_11 0 WE STILL HAVE A FEW EDGES
gFcAXCuhr_0_12 0 I CAN STILL FEEL THEM
gFcAXCuhr_0_13 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO KEEP GOING AT IT
gFcAXCuhr_0_14 0 AGAIN IT'S GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES
gFcAXCuhr_0_15 0 BUT IF YOU GO AT IT GOOD AND STEADY YOU CAN GET IT DONE QUICK
gFcAXCuhr_0_16 0 YEAH WE'VE TAKEN CARE OF THEM
gFcAXCuhr_0_17 0 SO NOW WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A DANGER TO PEOPLE WHO ARE PLAYING OUR XYLOPHONE SHOULD THEY SLIDE THEIR FINGER ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE
hHQe7R18FNs_1 0 IN THIS VIDEO WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MAKING A MULTIPLEX THROW WITH CLUBS
hHQe7R18FNs_2 0 NOW IF YOU REMEMBER FROM BALL JUGGLING A MULTIPLEX IS WHEN YOU THROW MORE THAN ONE BALL AT ONCE OR IN OUR CASE MORE THAN ONE CLUB AT ONCE
hHQe7R18FNs_3 0 WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE DOING TWO CLUB MULTIPLEXES
hHQe7R18FNs_4 0 FIRST OFF I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT A MULTIPLEX LOOKS LIKE WITH TWO CLUBS
hHQe7R18FNs_5 0 WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE IS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ONE CLUB DO A DOUBLE SPIN AND ONE CLUB DO A SINGLE SPIN SOMETHING LIKE ALMOST LIKE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT
hHQe7R18FNs_6 0 SO IF YOU NOTICE THE GREEN CLUB WHICH IS STACKED ON TOP OF MY HAND LIKE THIS THAT WILL GO RIGHT BACK TO MY RIGHT HAND
hHQe7R18FNs_7 0 THE ORANGE CLUB WHICH IS STACKED LIKE THIS THAT IS THE ONE THAT WILL SPIN TWICE
hHQe7R18FNs_8 0 NOW WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
hHQe7R18FNs_9 0 I WANT YOU TO TAKE YOUR NORMAL CLUB PATTERN YOUR CLUB HOLD HERE FOR TWO CLUBS AND PULL THE LOWER ONE OUT AS FAR AS YOU CAN AND PULL THE UPPER ONE BACK AS FAR AS YOU CAN
hHQe7R18FNs_10 0 WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS I WANT YOU TO GET AS MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LEVERAGE AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN SO WHEN YOU MAKE THAT THROW YOU GET THAT SPLIT IN THE HEIGHTS JUST LIKE THAT
hHQe7R18FNs_11 0 IT'S A MULTIPLEX WITH CLUBS
-gnyjvw2ABo_2 0 I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT SAFETY EQUIPMENT WHEN IN THE MARKET TO BUY A MOTORCYCLE
-gnyjvw2ABo_3 0 AND OUTSIDE OF YOUR HELMET YOU'RE JACKET IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF YOU SAFETY EQUIPMENT
-gnyjvw2ABo_4 0 AND HERE AT WOODS WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT STYLES OF JACKETS
-gnyjvw2ABo_5 0 WE HAVE OUR REGULAR LEATHERS AND OUR PERFORATED LEATHERS WE HAVE OUR TEXTILES WE HAVE EVERYTHING FROM BLUE JEAN TO A COMPOSITE BLEND MESH TEXTILE JACKET
-gnyjvw2ABo_6 0 THEY COME IN VERY MANY DIFFERENT SIZES AND COLORS
-gnyjvw2ABo_7 0 OUR JACKETS ALWAYS CARRY THE BODY ARMOR IN THEM FOR YOUR PERSONAL SAFETY
-gnyjvw2ABo_8 0 WE HAVE OUR SHOULDER ARMOR OUR ELBOW ARMOR AND OUR BACK PLATE
-gnyjvw2ABo_9 0 MOST OF THEM ARE A PERSONAL FIT
-gnyjvw2ABo_10 0 THEY'RE ALL VERY WONDERFUL JACKETS BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF BUYING A JACKET IS LOVING IT OWNING IT AND WEARING IT
GiTiHPq8avg_1 0 ONE OF THE FUNNY THINGS THAT I REMEMBER IS WHEN I WAS WORKING AT A NEWSPAPER IN KENTUCKY
GiTiHPq8avg_2 0 I HAD MADE A PREDICTION IN THE FRIDAY NEWSPAPER THAT THIS PARTICULAR SCHOOL THAT I COVERED AT THAT TIME WAS GOING TO LOSE THE NEXT DAY ON SATURDAY
GiTiHPq8avg_3 0 AND THEY WERE PLAYING A TEAM THAT REALLY WAS BETTER THAN THEM AND HAD WON SOME NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS AND THE GAME WAS EVEN ON THE ROAD FOR THE SCHOOL I WAS COVERING
GiTiHPq8avg_4 0 SO YOU KNOW EVERY FRIDAY I MAKE MY PREDICTION IN THE PAPER AND I SAID THAT I THOUGHT THIS TEAM I COVERED WAS GOING TO GET BEAT
GiTiHPq8avg_5 0 SO THE TEAM I COVERED ENDS UP WINNING THE GAME AND I COME OUT ON MY COLUMN IN MONDAY'S PAPER SAYING I GUESS I HAVE TO EAT CROW BECAUSE I WAS WRONG AND I ADMIT IT
GiTiHPq8avg_6 0 I GO TO THE COACHES PRESS LUNCHEON ON TUESDAY AND HE COMES OUT WITH A PLASTIC CROW LAYING ON A PLATE WITH A FORK AND KNIFE FOR ME AND HE'S GOT IT COVERED WITH A NAPKIN AND HE PULLS THE NAPKIN OFF AND SAYS I'D LIKE TO PRESENT THIS TO BRETT
GiTiHPq8avg_7 0 AND HE KIND OF DID THIS IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY AND HE HANDS ME THIS CROW PLASTIC CROW LAYING ON A PLATE LIKE IT WAS TIME FOR ME TO EAT CROW
GiTiHPq8avg_8 0 I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT
GiTiHPq8avg_9 0 I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY
GiTiHPq8avg_10 0 I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH IT
GiTiHPq8avg_11 0 IT WAS GOOD THAT HE HAD A SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT THE FACT I HADN'T PICKED HIS TEAM TO WIN
GiTiHPq8avg_12 0 SO THAT WAS ONE THAT I STILL REMEMBER AND SOME OF MY FRIENDS ACTUALLY STILL TALK ABOUT
GiTiHPq8avg_13 0 THAT WAS A GOOD MOMENT
GiTiHPq8avg_14 0 ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY LIKE MOST ABOUT BEING A SPORTS WRITER IS THAT IT'S A DAILY CHALLENGE FOR ME WORKING HERE IN NASHVILLE TENNESSEE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO READ WHAT I WRITE
GiTiHPq8avg_15 0 SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE THAT COMES WITH THAT
GiTiHPq8avg_16 0 BUT I ALSO LOVE THE CHALLENGE OF IT BECAUSE I LIKE THE FACT THAT I NEED TO PRODUCE SOMETHING THAT IS FACTUALLY CORRECT AND INTERESTING ENOUGH FOR THESE PEOPLE TO WANT TO PICK UP AND READ NOT ONLY TOMORROW BUT THE NEXT DAY AND THE NEXT DAY AND THE NEXT DAY
GiTiHPq8avg_17 0 SO EACH DAY IT'S KIND OF A CHALLENGE TO CRAFT SOMETHING TO PUT IT TOGETHER AND MAKE IT INTERESTING
GiTiHPq8avg_18 0 AND SOMETIMES IT'S A LITTLE DAUNTING WHEN IT'S ELEVEN O'CLOCK AND YOU'VE GOT THIRTY MORE MINUTES TO FINISH YOUR DEADLINE TO MAKE YOUR DEADLINE BUT I ALSO REALLY LIKE THE CHALLENGE OF THAT
h_GGjLJtddg_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WITH THE IDEA OF DOUBLE HAND PUSH HANDS WITH A PARTNER
h_GGjLJtddg_2 0 SO WE COME BACK HERE AGAIN CONTINUING WITH OUR DOUBLE HAND PUSH HANDS
h_GGjLJtddg_3 0 NOW WHAT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU DO PUSH HANDS IS TO NOT COLLAPSE YOUR BODY
h_GGjLJtddg_4 0 BECAUSE REMEMBER IN SOME OF THE OTHER SEQUENCES I HAD TALKED ABOUT NOT CRUSHING THE EGG
h_GGjLJtddg_5 0 SO WE WANT TO HAVE A SENSE LIKE THERE IS A BALLOON INSIDE HERE
h_GGjLJtddg_6 0 SO KEEPING A VERY GOOD STRUCTURE NOT ALLOWING THAT STRUCTURE TO RELEASE
h_GGjLJtddg_7 0 NOW I HAVE A CHOICE AS HE COMES INTO MY CENTER I CAN ALLOW MY STRUCTURE TO RELEASE OR I CAN KEEP THIS TIGHT BUT THAT'S ALSO A PROBLEM
h_GGjLJtddg_8 0 SO WHAT I NEED TO DO IS AS HE ADDS PRESSURE IN IS I KEEP THE BALLOON BUT I SIT AND TURN
h_GGjLJtddg_9 0 NOW I CAN COME IN AN PUSH IN ON HIM
h_GGjLJtddg_10 0 HE KEEPS HIS STRUCTURE IF HE STAYS TIGHT AND DOESN'T TURN AND KEEPS HIS STRUCTURE AND DOESN'T TURN THEN I'M GOING TO PUSH HIM OVER
h_GGjLJtddg_11 0 IF HE COLLAPSES HIS STRUCTURE I'M GOING TO PUSH HIM OVER
h_GGjLJtddg_12 0 BUT IF HE KEEPS HIS STRUCTURE THEN SIT AND TURNS HE CAN NEUTRALIZE AND DEFLECT
h_GGjLJtddg_13 0 SO I'M NICE AND OPEN HE PUSHES IN I SIT DOWN AND TURN AND THEN I'M IN THE ADVANTAGE POSITION
h351h1Blzhk_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS JOE SPANO
h351h1Blzhk_2 0 OKAY IN THE SERVE ONCE THE STUDENT IS COMFORTABLE WITH THE TAKE BACK TO THE BACK SCRATCH WHERE THEY CAN TOSS IT IN TWO STEPS AND HIT DEPENDING ON THE ABILITY OF THE STUDENTS AND HOW COMFORTABLE THEY ARE WITH THIS STROKE HOW MANY LESSONS AND HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES
h351h1Blzhk_3 0 WE THEN WANT TO TRY AND PUT THE WHOLE TOSS OF THE BALL AS YOU ARE TAKING IT BACK
h351h1Blzhk_4 0 WHAT I LIKE TO SAY TO THE STUDENTS IS THINK OF A BASE OF A TRIANGLE AND YOU WANT TO GET THE BALL RIGHT OVER YOUR HEAD TO THE A PASS
h351h1Blzhk_5 0 SO YOU ARE TOSSING THE BALL JUST AS YOU ARE TAKING YOUR RACKET BACK BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO COME TO THE BACK SCRATCH
h351h1Blzhk_6 0 SO IT IS THIS WAY UP DOWN TOSS AND HIT WITH A BIG FOLLOW THROUGH
h351h1Blzhk_7 0 THE EMPHASES IS NOT TO STOP THIS MOTION TO THE BACK SCRATCH NO MATTER WHERE THE TOSS IS OR LET IT GO UP HIT IT AND FOLLOW THROUGH
HFbz10GyFs4_1 0 THIS FALLS INTO THE CATEGORY OF MORE ON BIDDING
HFbz10GyFs4_2 0 YOU UNDERSTAND THE GAME NOW YOU UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLES YOU UNDERSTAND THE SCORING YOU UNDERSTAND RENEGES AND FOLLOWING SUIT AND MAYBE YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A SHOT AT IT ON THE COMPUTER AND THE COMPUTER DEALS YOU THIS HAND
HFbz10GyFs4_3 0 MAYBE YOU'RE PLAYING WITH FRIENDS AND YOU GET A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THIS HAND
HFbz10GyFs4_4 0 LET'S EVALUATE THIS HAND
HFbz10GyFs4_5 0 WE HAVE A TYPICAL FOUR FOUR THREE FOUR THREE
HFbz10GyFs4_7 0 TWO AND FOUR IS SIX AND THREE IS NINE AND THREE IS TWELVE
HFbz10GyFs4_8 0 OF COURSE I MISSED ONE NOW LET'S LOOK AT THIS HAND
HFbz10GyFs4_9 0 ANYWAY WE HAVE A TYPICAL FIVE THREE THREE TWO HAND WHICH IS THE SECOND MOST PROBABLE DISTRIBUTION THAT YOU'LL PICK UP
HFbz10GyFs4_10 0 FIVE THREE THREE TWO FROM FOUR DIFFERENT SUITS
HFbz10GyFs4_11 0 ACE KING OF HEARTS LOOK GOOD FOR TWO TRICKS ACE KING OF CLUBS FOR TWO TRICKS AND THE ACE OF SPADES IS DEFINITELY ONE TRICK
HFbz10GyFs4_12 0 NOW THE PUREST WILL SAY WELL YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO BID FIVE BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMEONE IS TRUMPING THE THIRD ROUND OF HEARTS
HFbz10GyFs4_13 0 SO IF YOU'RE A CONSERVATIVE PLAYER AND YOU WANT TO ERE ON THE SIDE OF BEING SAFE YOU COULD BID FOUR ON THIS AND PRETTY MUCH TAKE THAT TO THE BANK
HFbz10GyFs4_14 0 IF YOU'RE AN ACCURATE OR AGGRESSIVE PLAYER YOU WOULD SAY FIVE BUT THE RISK IS IF YOU DO GET A BAD BREAK IN ONE OF THESE SUITS THEN YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE A TRICK THAT YOU WERE COUNTING ON SO I WOULD SAY FOR THE NEWER PLAYER OR EVEN FOR THE EXPERIENCED PLAYER AS FAR AS BEING SAFE A FOUR BID IS COMFORTABLE
HFbz10GyFs4_15 0 MEANING THAT IF YOU MAKE THAT BID YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE FORTY POINTS
HFbz10GyFs4_16 0 NOW SAY YOUR PARTNER BIDS THREE AND YOU'VE ERRED SLIGHTLY AND HE'S BIDDING PRETTY ACCURATELY THEN YOU'VE PRETTY MUCH GOT THAT COVERED
HFbz10GyFs4_17 0 AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE BIDDING YOUR HAND BID THE TRICKS THAT YOU EXPECT TO TAKE
HFbz10GyFs4_18 0 ACES ARE USUALLY WINNERS ACES AND KINGS TOGETHER ARE WINNERS
HFbz10GyFs4_19 0 SUPPOSING THAT WE HAD THIS CLUB SUIT LOOKING SOMETHING LIKE THIS
HFbz10GyFs4_20 0 WOULD YOU BID THAT KING OF CLUBS
HFbz10GyFs4_21 0 IT'S A LITTLE RISKY IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHERE THE ACE IS
HFbz10GyFs4_22 0 IF THE ACE OF CLUBS IS OVER HERE THEN THE KING IS GOING TO GET SWALLOWED UP
HFbz10GyFs4_23 0 IF THE ACE OF CLUBS IS IN YOU PARTNER'S HAND THIS IS THE KEY CARD HERE THEN YOUR KING WILL WALK THROUGH
HFbz10GyFs4_24 0 IF THE ACE OF CLUBS IS HERE WELL THAT'S O.K
HFbz10GyFs4_25 0 TOO BECAUSE IF THE LEAD COMES THROUGH HERE YOU'LL GET YOUR KING IN
H8T-YrBHEOM_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS PAT LOUIS
H8T-YrBHEOM_2 0 HERE IN MIAMI I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU TODAY HOW TO SET UP A DRUM KIT
H8T-YrBHEOM_3 0 THESE ARE THE TWO CYMBALS THAT PUT TOGETHER YOUR HIGH HAT
H8T-YrBHEOM_4 0 ONE IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER THAT'S THE ONE YOU WANT ON THE BOTTOM
H8T-YrBHEOM_5 0 SO THAT WILL REST ON THAT LITTLE PED THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE OTHER ONE HAS A LITTLE OPENING THAT GOES OVER THIS LITTLE ROD
H8T-YrBHEOM_6 0 THAT SLIPS ONTO THE ROD AND THEN IT WILL ADJUST TO THE LEVEL THAT IS BEST TO GET THAT OPEN AND CLOSE SOUND THAT YOU ALWAYS WANT
H8T-YrBHEOM_7 0 ONCE IT'S ON THERE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE NOT TOUCHING AGAINST THAT RATTLE SO YOU WANT IT TO BE ABOVE JUST HIGH ENOUGH SO WHEN YOU PUT IT DOWN IT'S A NICE TYPE SOUND
H8T-YrBHEOM_8 0 WHEN YOU RELEASE IT GOES AWAY FROM THE BOTTOM ONE AND IT DOESN'T RATTLE YOU WON'T HEAR ANY OF THAT
H8T-YrBHEOM_9 0 FOR MY TASTE THIS SHOULD BE A LITTLE LOWER WHICH I WILL ADJUST A LITTLE LATER ON
H8T-YrBHEOM_10 0 SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO BE UP HERE PLAYING THE DRUMS HERE INSTEAD THEY HAVE IT UP IN A CLOSER FILL AREA WHEN THEY GO TO THE TOM TOM'S
GJ3-x0V-pR8_1 0 AND LOOK AT THIS WHEN YOU TAKE IT OUT YOU KNOW THESE FOLDED ARMS SUDDENLY BECOME A TEXTURE
GJ3-x0V-pR8_2 0 THEY'RE KIND OF A TEXTURE OF REPEATED FORMS THAT YOU SEE AND IT KIND CREATES A KIND OF RHYTHM AND YOU IF YOU EVEN PUT IT THAT WAY YOU KNOW YOU START TO PLAY WITH TEXTURE
GJ3-x0V-pR8_3 0 SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HELPS YOU SORT OF GAIN OR INCREASE YOUR SORT OF VISUAL PERCEPTION IS TO ACTUALLY GO THROUGH MAGAZINES AND LOOK FOR AS MANY TEXTURES AS YOU CAN FIND
GJ3-x0V-pR8_4 0 THE PROBLEM BEING THEN OF COURSE TO PUT THEM TOGETHER WELL AND AGAIN THIS SERVES AS A NOT BAD EXAMPLE OF PUTTING THEM TOGETHER WELL
GJ3-x0V-pR8_5 0 THIS PERSON REALLY KIND OF YOU KNOW NOTICE THERE'S NO RED IN HERE AND NO ORANGE NO BRIGHT COLORS AND THAT KIND OF HOLDS IT TOGETHER
GJ3-x0V-pR8_6 0 WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY ITEMS HAPPENING YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T HAVE TOO MANY THINGS GOING ON
GJ3-x0V-pR8_7 0 SO WITH A COLLAGE YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO GET EXCITED ABOUT TEXTURE BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT TO FIND WAYS TO UNIFY IT
GJ3-x0V-pR8_8 0 MAYBE IT'S THE TYPE OF TEXTURE SIMILAR OR THE COLORS OF EVERYTHING ARE SIMILAR
GJ3-x0V-pR8_9 0 CERTAINLY THE SHAPES THAT YOU CUT THEM INTO ARE ALSO SIMILAR
GJ3-x0V-pR8_10 0 THIS ONE HAS THINGS THAT ARE ALL KIND OF THE SAME SIZE SO YOU KNOW COLLAGE IS HARD TO WORK WITH IN A WAY BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY CHOICES AND IT'S HARD TO WHITTLE IT DOWN
GJ3-x0V-pR8_11 0 BUT ON THE OTHER HAND AGAIN ITS PIECES OF PAPER THAT YOU CAN MOVE AROUND ANY WAY THAT YOU WANT TO
GJ3-x0V-pR8_12 0 YOU CAN USE FABRIC YOU KNOW
GJ3-x0V-pR8_13 0 I MEAN A QUILT IN A KIND OF WAY IS ALMOST A COLLAGE BECAUSE YOU'RE MOVING AROUND THESE VARIOUS PIECES AND PUTTING THEM INTO A DESIGN WITH EACH OTHER

GBrHWmc7YSE_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT LOOSENING THE SHOULDERS AND ARMS
GBrHWmc7YSE_2 0 THERE'S SO MUCH TENSION WE HOLD IN OUR SHOULDERS AND ARMS
GBrHWmc7YSE_3 0 SO A COUPLE OF THE WAYS WE CAN DO THAT IS WE BEGIN WITH OUR ARMS LOOSELY BY THE SIDE
GBrHWmc7YSE_4 0 WE LIFT OUR HEELS LET THE ARMS COME UP THE HEELS COME DOWN AND JUST LET IT COME FROM THE SHOULDER ELBOW WRIST
GBrHWmc7YSE_5 0 IT'S VERY LOOSE IT'S LIKE TRYING TO GET WATER OFF OF YOUR ARMS
GBrHWmc7YSE_6 0 YOU DO THAT A NUMBER OF TIMES THEN YOU BRING YOUR ARMS BEHIND AND DO THE SAME THING
GBrHWmc7YSE_7 0 YOU BRING THEM UP AND DOWN LIFTING AND DROPPING THE HEEL
GBrHWmc7YSE_8 0 I CAUTION YOU IF YOU HAVE A BAD BACK NOT TO DO THAT WITH YOUR HEELS JUST DO IT FEET FLAT ON THE GROUND
GBrHWmc7YSE_9 0 THEN YOU CAN DO ALTERNATING
GBrHWmc7YSE_10 0 ONE ARM SWINGS OTHER ARMS SWINGS
GBrHWmc7YSE_11 0 AND IF YOU NOTICE I'M RISING AND LOWERING MY BODY
GBrHWmc7YSE_12 0 NOW MY FIVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER SHOWED ME THIS ONE EXERCISE
GBrHWmc7YSE_13 0 MY FIVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER JADE HAS FOUND OUT TO BE EXCELLENT FOR THE SHOULDER
GBrHWmc7YSE_14 0 WE BRING THE HANDS CLAP IN FRONT BRING THEM BACK AROUND AND CLAP IN THE BACK
GBrHWmc7YSE_15 0 SO YOU CLAP FRONT AND BACK FRONT AND BACK AND I FOUND THIS TO BE AN EXCELLENT EXERCISE FOR LOOSENING THE SHOULDER AND GIVING YOU FULL RANGE OF MOTION
GBrHWmc7YSE_16 0 ANOTHER ONE IS THAT WE CAN SHIFT OUT WEIGHT LET OUR ARMS SWING LIKE A DRUM
GBrHWmc7YSE_17 0 OUR ARMS TAP OUR BODY THE WAIST AND THE KIDNEYS
GBrHWmc7YSE_18 0 JUST TOTALLY LET YOUR ARMS LOOSELY SWING
GhhEHNWnwzA_1 0 SO NEXT WE ARE GOING TO DO A VARIATION ON THAT NAARI GORONG STEP
GhhEHNWnwzA_2 0 THAT WAS KIND OF THE SIMPLIFIED VERSION
GhhEHNWnwzA_3 0 ONCE YOU KIND OF GET COMFORTABLE WITH THAT HOP TO YOUR LEFT FOOT WE ARE GOING TO WORK ON A DOUBLE HOP TO THE LEFT FOOT
GhhEHNWnwzA_4 0 IT IS JUST A SIMPLE IDEA OF SHIFTING YOUR WEIGHT AND FIGURING OUT WHEN TO SHIFT YOUR WEIGHT
GhhEHNWnwzA_5 0 IT IS THE SAME BASIC MOVE SO WE'RE GOING TO GO RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT LEFT
GhhEHNWnwzA_6 0 WE'LL JUST DO THAT A FEW TIMES TO GET THAT INTO YOUR FEET JUST GET COMFORTABLE WITH THE DOUBLE HOP ON TO YOUR LEFT FOOT AND THE MORE YOU CAN KIND OF GRAB AT YOUR CLOTHES THAT IS MORE AESTHETICALLY PLEASING I HAVE SEEN BECAUSE A LOT OF THE TIMES THE CLOTHES THAT YOU ARE WEARING THIS KIND OF DANCE THEY'RE GOING TO BE BAGGY THEY'RE GOING TO STICK OUT LIKE THIS AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE GRAB THEIR CLOTHES DIFFERENT WAYS
GhhEHNWnwzA_7 0 SOMETIMES THEY'LL GRAB THEM UP HERE SO YOU CAN KIND OF FIGURE OUT ONCE YOU GET COMFORTABLE WITH THE STEP WHAT YOU'RE THE MOST COMFORTABLE WITH KIND OF MOVING AND GRABBING AT YOUR CLOTHES
GhhEHNWnwzA_8 0 SO WE'LL JUST QUICKLY DO THAT WITH THE DRUM RHYTHM AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO ANOTHER VARIATION
GhhEHNWnwzA_9 0 AND THAT'S VARIATION NUMBER ONE

HHzimWOGCwo_3 0 NOW YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DROP YOUR ACOUSTIC GUITAR TO A DROP D TUNING
HHzimWOGCwo_4 0 THAT IS THE D OR THE LOW E STRING SHOULD BE AN OCTAVE LOWER THAN THIS D STRING HERE
HHzimWOGCwo_5 0 EVERYTHING ELSE IS BASICALLY THE SAME OKAY

HFhSrWam2MM_8 0 NEXT WE HAVE OUR PRIMER AND WE HAVE AN ACRYLIC LATEX PRIMER AS OPPOSED TO AN OIL PRIMER BECAUSE IT DRIES VERY FAST AND IT'S FLEXIBLE
HFhSrWam2MM_9 0 SO IT'S NOT GOING TO SHOW AS MUCH CRACKS AND IT'S VERY GOOD FOR ADHESION AND SEALING UP ANY TYPE OF SURFACES WE'RE GOING TO BE REPAIRING
HFhSrWam2MM_10 0 SUCH AS GREASY SURFACES OR DUSTY CHALKY SURFACES AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PAINT STICKS ONTO THOSE SURFACES
HFhSrWam2MM_11 0 AND THERE'S A LOT OF GREASY SURFACES IN KITCHENS SO THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD AS AN IN BETWEEN COAT
HFhSrWam2MM_12 0 FINALLY WE HAVE THE PAINT
HFhSrWam2MM_13 0 WE'VE SELECTED FOR THIS PROJECT A PEARL FINISH WHICH IS RELATIVELY SHINY AND IT'S GOING TO BE GOING ON THE TRIM AND THE WALLS
HFhSrWam2MM_14 0 O.K SO NOW THAT I'VE SHOWN YOU ALL THE TOOLS AND MATERIALS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED LET'S START SETTING UP THIS KITCHEN
gudUt9vxL2M_1 0 ANOTHER VARIATION OF THE SPIKES OR MAGGOTS IF WE HAVE TO CALL THEM THAT IS CALLED A MOUSIE
gudUt9vxL2M_2 0 NOW IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS WHY THEY CALL THEM MOUSIES
gudUt9vxL2M_3 0 YOU CAN SEE HERE THEY EACH HAVE TAILS TO THEM
gudUt9vxL2M_4 0 YOU CAN SEE THEM WIGGLING AROUND HERE A LITTLE BIT AND THEY MOVE THOSE TAILS
gudUt9vxL2M_5 0 THAT CAN BE VERY ATTRACTIVE TO A FEEDING PERCH OR SMELT
gudUt9vxL2M_6 0 SO THESE ARE CALLED MOUSIES AND FOR OBVIOUS REASONS
gudUt9vxL2M_7 0 WE LIKE TO PUT THESE MOUSIES ON THE HOOK IN THE SAME WAY WE PUT THE SPIKES ON THE HOOK
gudUt9vxL2M_8 0 BUT WE WANT TO LINE IT UP SO THAT THESE TAILS WILL REALLY WIGGLE AND ACT AS AN ATTRACTANT
gudUt9vxL2M_9 0 SO LET'S TAKE A MOUSIE DON'T WORRY HE WON'T SQUEAK AND PUT HIM ON THE HOOK SO THAT THE TAIL IS STICKING OUT
gudUt9vxL2M_10 0 LOOK AT THAT TAIL MOVE
gudUt9vxL2M_11 0 WE WANT TO PUT A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT MOUSIES ON HERE SO THAT WE CAN GET PLENTY OF ACTION
gudUt9vxL2M_12 0 THERE WE GO WE HAVE TWO MOUSIES WE CAN EVEN ADD A THIRD
gudUt9vxL2M_13 0 AND NOW WE'VE GOT A LITTLE MOUSIE HOUSEY
gudUt9vxL2M_14 0 IT'S ALL READY TO GO LOTS OF ACTION LOTS OF SCENT SOMETHING THAT THE PERCH ARE REALLY GOING TO FIGHT FOR
G8if_nq_RxE_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT PLAYING THE ADVANTAGE
G8if_nq_RxE_2 0 NOW FOULS DO OCCUR IN A SOCCER GAME BUT NOT ALWAYS ARE THOSE FOULS BLOWN BY THE OFFICIAL
G8if_nq_RxE_3 0 REASON BEING IS SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT HAVE THE BALL AND ANOTHER TEAM MIGHT FOUL YOU BUT YOU MIGHT STILL MAINTAIN POSSESSION OF THE BALL OR A TEAMMATE MIGHT POSSESS THE BALL AND GIVE YOURSELF A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SCORE A GOAL
G8if_nq_RxE_4 0 IN THIS SITUATION THE OFFICIAL WILL CALL OUT PLAY ON WHICH MEANS THAT I SEE THE FOUL BUT I AM GOING TO LET YOU CONTINUE TO PLAY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE IN THIS SITUATION AND HAVE A POSSIBILITY OF SCORING
G8if_nq_RxE_5 0 NOW SAY THAT THE PLAY IS GOING ON AND THERE IS A FOUL AND YOU TOUCH THE BALL BUT DO NOT GET GOOD POSSESSION AND THEN THE OTHER TEAM GETS IT INITIALLY THE OFFICIAL MIGHT NOT STOP BECAUSE HE THINKS YOU HAVE AN ADVANTAGE
G8if_nq_RxE_6 0 BUT ONCE YOU LOSE THAT ADVANTAGE HE CAN THEN BLOW THE WHISTLE AND CALL THE FOUL THAT PREVIOUSLY OCCURRED
G8if_nq_RxE_7 0 ONE THING ALSO ABOUT ADVANTAGE IS THAT WHEN THE REFEREE GIVES IT HE CAN ALSO STILL HAND OUT A CARD FOR THE FOUL SO EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY HAVE BLATANTLY TAKEN SOMEONE OUT AND THEY STILL MAINTAINED POSSESSION IF THEY DON'T CALL IT RIGHT AWAY THE REFEREE CAN STILL AWARD THE CARD TOO
Hhz96IOA8U8_1 0 HI MY NAME IS JULIA TRIGILA IN SCOTTSDALE ARIZONA ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE
Hhz96IOA8U8_2 0 BEFORE I GET STARTED WITH MY DEMONSTRATION I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THE SIZES THAT I HAVE USED ON KIM'S EYE
Hhz96IOA8U8_3 0 DOWN HERE AT THE END WE HAVE CREATED A FLARE LOOK
Hhz96IOA8U8_4 0 THAT IS A 25 MM IN THICKNESS AND FOURTEEN MM IN LENGTH AND WE HAVE DONE THAT FROM HERE TO HERE
Hhz96IOA8U8_5 0 AND THEN I START WEAVING IN TWELVE MM AROUND THIS AREA IN WITH THE 14S
Hhz96IOA8U8_6 0 AND START DOING 12S ALL THE WAY THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE LID
Hhz96IOA8U8_7 0 ONCE WE GET TO THE INNER CORNERS WHERE WE DON'T NEED THEM AS LONG ANYMORE I START WEAVING IN 10S WITH THE 12S
Hhz96IOA8U8_8 0 AND THEN I START GOING WITH THE 10S TOWARD THE INNER CORNER AND THEN I MIGHT USE A FEW 8S TOWARDS THE VERY INNER INNER CORNER
Hhz96IOA8U8_9 0 SO THAT WAY NONE OF THE LONG ONES ARE HITTING THE INSIDE OF THE NOSE
Hhz96IOA8U8_10 0 SO THIS IS THE LOOK THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED FOR KIM THAT WORKS BEST FOR HER EYE
Hhz96IOA8U8_11 0 SHE WANTED THE FLARE LOOK AND THAT'S WHAT SHE GOT
Hhz96IOA8U8_12 0 AND SHE IS ALSO ABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS LOOK BECAUSE SHE HAS A NICE HIGH ARCH OVER HERE AND SHE IS ABLE TO STILL HAVE SPACE IN BETWEEN HER LASHES AND HER BROW
Hhz96IOA8U8_13 0 SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO PULL OFF THIS LOOK BECAUSE IF THEY PUT A FOURTEEN ON IT MIGHT BE TOUCHING THEIR EYEBROW AND THAT'S WAY TOO DRAMATIC FOR SOME PEOPLE
Hhz96IOA8U8_14 0 I DO HAVE DIFFERENT LENGTHS TO ACHIEVE THE LOOK THAT YOU ARE GOING FOR AND I ALSO HAVE DIFFERENT THICKNESSES IF YOU DON'T WANT SOMETHING AS THICK AND DRAMATIC
Hhz96IOA8U8_15 0 I AM ALSO ABLE TO TAKE SIX MM WHICH ARE SMALLER THAN THE ONES IN HERE AND DO YOUR BOTTOM LASH AS WELL
Hhz96IOA8U8_16 0 WHAT ARE EYELASH EXTENSIONS
Hhz96IOA8U8_17 0 EYELASH EXTENSIONS IS A REVOLUTIONARY WAY TO EXTEND THE LENGTH AND THICKNESS OF YOUR EYELASHES
Hhz96IOA8U8_18 0 THE LASHES ARE SYNTHETIC AND TAPERED FROM THICK TO THIN TO RESEMBLE A REAL EYELASH
Hhz96IOA8U8_19 0 IT IS APPLIED ON A HAIR BY HAIR BASIS TO YOUR OWN LASHES FOR A COMPLETELY NATURAL LOOK
Hhz96IOA8U8_20 0 THIS PROCESS LEAVES YOUR EYELASHES LONGER THICKER FULLER AND MORE GORGEOUS
Hhz96IOA8U8_21 0 YOU CAN NOW THROW OUT YOUR MASCARA AND LOOK FORWARD TO WAKING UP IN THE MORNING WITH BEAUTIFUL LASHES TO GO

gWDB8K2PzsM_7 0 SO YOU HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF WINNING
gWDB8K2PzsM_8 0 YOUR ODDS ARE DEFINITELY WITH YOU
gWDB8K2PzsM_9 0 LIKE SAID EARLIER IN A COUPLE OF THE VIDEOS BEFORE THE CASINO TAKES OUT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OUT OF THE POT

gWDB8K2PzsM_11 0 USUALLY WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING AGAINST THE HOUSE THE HOUSE DOES HAVE THE ADVANTAGE IT'S A REALLY GOOD GAME ESPECIALLY WITH THE POPULARITY OF TEXAS HOLD EM
gWDB8K2PzsM_12 0 SEVEN CARD STUD IS KIND OF LOW KEY
gWDB8K2PzsM_13 0 A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN'T PLAYING SEVEN CARD STUD SO THE WAITING LISTS ARE VERY LIMITED
gWDB8K2PzsM_14 0 YOU'RE USUALLY NOT GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT
gWDB8K2PzsM_15 0 YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET RIGHT IN SIT DOWN AND PLAY AS LONG AS YOU LIKE
gWDB8K2PzsM_16 0 SEVEN CARD STUD IS A LOT OF FUN
gWDB8K2PzsM_17 0 IT'S A LOT OF CHASING TRYING TO GET THAT MADE HAND DOWN TO THE LAST CARD
gWDB8K2PzsM_18 0 IT'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT
gWDB8K2PzsM_19 0 A LOT OF MONEY TO BE MADE TOO
gWDB8K2PzsM_20 0 WHERE AS IN HOLD EM YOU ONLY GET A COUPLE CHANCES TO BET BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY FIVE CARD PUT OUT
gWDB8K2PzsM_21 0 SEVEN CARD STUD GIVES YOU MORE CHANCES TO BET SO THERE'S MORE MONEY TO BE MADE
gWDB8K2PzsM_22 0 YOU GET SEVEN CHANCES AND YOU JUST KEEP BETTING AND BETTING
gWDB8K2PzsM_23 0 IT'S A GOOD FUN WAY TO HAVE SOME FUN

gWDB8K2PzsM_28 0 ALL IN ALL SEVEN CARD STUD IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES SO I WILL SEE YOU AT THE TABLES
gWDB8K2PzsM_29 0 THANK YOU FOR WATCHING

H7zZS-TQhc4_22 0 WE WANT TO HAVE A LITTLE BEND IN THE ELBOW SO THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE HAND IS HITTING FORWARD
H7zZS-TQhc4_23 0 THIS IS HOW WE'RE PERFORMING THE HAMMER STRIKE
H7zZS-TQhc4_24 0 THE LEGS ARE IN OUR BOW STANCE HIPS ARE FORWARD

gcPQJt638OU_1 0 HI I'M SUFI BRADSHAW WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
gcPQJt638OU_2 0 I'M NOW GOING TO GO OVER THE BACK
gcPQJt638OU_3 0 IT'S JUST ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS OF THE BODY BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY MUSCLES
gcPQJt638OU_4 0 IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO START OUT WITH A NICE CLEAN DRAPE TO JUST FOLD THE SHEET OVER ITSELF A COUPLE OF TIMES UNTIL IT GETS TO THIS RIGHT IN THIS AREA
gcPQJt638OU_5 0 RIGHT BEFORE THE GLUTES OR THE BACK ENDS
gcPQJt638OU_6 0 IT'S ALSO GOOD TO KEEP YOUR OIL CLOSE TO YOU SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DISCONNECT FROM THE BODY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
gcPQJt638OU_7 0 I AM A FAN OF PUTTING OIL HERE ON MY FOREARM
gcPQJt638OU_8 0 I'M DOING THIS BECAUSE I'M GOING TO APPLY A STROKE CALLED IRONING WHICH IS BASICALLY A DEEPER TISSUE STROKE
gcPQJt638OU_9 0 WHAT THAT DOES IS IT PENETRATES THE MUSCLES AT A FASTER RATE THAN JUST DOING AN EFFLORAGE OR SOMETHING SUPERFICIAL
gcPQJt638OU_10 0 I'M GOING TO START OUT WITH PLACING MY FOREARM ON MY CLIENTS BACK HERE UP AROUND THE NECK AREA
gcPQJt638OU_11 0 I'M GOING TO REMEMBER TO SINK INTO MY LEGS AND USE MY LEGS AS THE GUIDE
gcPQJt638OU_12 0 JUST FOLLOW THAT MUSCLE ERECTOR SPINAE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE GLUTES AND THEN PULL UP
gcPQJt638OU_13 0 AND I'M GOING TO DO THAT REPEAT THAT A COUPLE TIMES
gcPQJt638OU_14 0 WHAT THIS DOES IS JUST WAKES THE MUSCLES UP AND TELLS THE MUSCLES THAT THEY ARE CONNECTED
gcPQJt638OU_15 0 THE ENTIRE BACK MUSCLES ARE CONNECTED ON A SHEET
gcPQJt638OU_16 0 THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING CALLED THE INNER SKIN WHICH IS YOUR FASCIA WHICH CONNECTS ALL OF YOUR MUSCLES TOGETHER
gcPQJt638OU_17 0 SO WHAT THIS STROKE IS REALLY GOOD FOR IS LOOSENING UP YOUR FASCIA WHICH IS THE INNER SKIN THAT HOLDS THE MUSCLES IN LIKE A CORD TYPE OF THING
gcPQJt638OU_18 0 AND YOU CAN GO DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE BACK WITH IT
gcPQJt638OU_19 0 I'M GOING TO MOVE OVER AND DO THIS SIDE AS WELL
gcPQJt638OU_20 0 THERE'S OIL HERE ON MY FOREARM
gcPQJt638OU_21 0 STAND MY LEGS AND GLIDE
gcPQJt638OU_22 0 MASSAGES ARE SO BENEFICIAL
gcPQJt638OU_23 0 I LIKE GETTING MY MASSAGES IN THE MORNING TO START THE DAY
gcPQJt638OU_24 0 SO THAT WAY MY BODIES PREPARED MY MIND IS PREPARED AND I'M PREPARED
gcPQJt638OU_25 0 AND THEN THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER DEEP TISSUE STROKE CALLED FISTS WHICH YOU JUST TAKE YOUR TWO FISTS AND YOU GLIDE DOWN THE MUSCLE THIS WAY USING YOUR HIP TO PUSH YOU NOT YOUR HANDS
gcPQJt638OU_26 0 IT S VERY SIMILAR TO THE IRONING EARLIER ACCEPT THEIR FISTS SO THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE SHALLOW
gcPQJt638OU_27 0 AND THEN LASTLY I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING CALLED WRINGING WHICH IS JUST TAKING THE BACK CROSSING THE HAND OVER ITSELF
gcPQJt638OU_28 0 AND A LOT OF THIS IS COMING FROM THE PELVIS
gcPQJt638OU_29 0 AND YOU CAN ALSO APPLY ANY OF THESE STROKES TO ANY PART
gcPQJt638OU_30 0 YOU CAN TAKE THE IRONING LIKE WE DID EARLIER AND YOU CAN PUSH IT ON THE SHOULDER BLADE MUSCLES WHICH IS A LOT OF A STRESSFUL PART BECAUSE SO MUCH OF OUR DAY IS SITTING UP OR IN THE CAR OR BY THE COMPUTER
gcPQJt638OU_31 0 THESE MUSCLES HERE WHICH ARE CONNECTED TO THE CLAVICLE THEY GET EXTREMELY TIGHT
gcPQJt638OU_32 0 SO IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO PUSH THOSE THINGS OUT
gcPQJt638OU_33 0 AND YOU CAN ALSO APPLY FISTS TO THOSE MUSCLES AS WELL AS ANY OF THE OTHER STROKES WE LEARNED SUCH AS STRIPPING
gcPQJt638OU_34 0 YOU CAN DO COMBO STROKES
gcPQJt638OU_35 0 IT'S ALL UP TO YOU AS A MASSAGE THERAPIST
gcPQJt638OU_36 0 SO THIS IS THE BACK AND THIS IS THE LAST PART
gcPQJt638OU_37 0 I'M GOING TO END THIS SESSION BY COVERING UP THE BODY
gcPQJt638OU_38 0 AND THEN MUCH LIKE WE STARTED I'M GOING TO JUST ADD DEPULPMENT HERE TO SORT OF JUST SAY GOODBYE
gcPQJt638OU_39 0 THIS IS A PARTING BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN A UNIT
gcPQJt638OU_40 0 IT'S A VERY VERY SPIRITUAL THING
gcPQJt638OU_41 0 DOWN THE ENTIRE BODY TAKE THE HANDS UP INTO THE HAIR MASSAGE THE HEAD JUST A LITTLE BIT
gcPQJt638OU_42 0 INTRODUCE YOURSELF TO EVERY PART
gcPQJt638OU_43 0 AND THEN SEPARATE
GuYZuooiVUM_1 0 I'M KELLI I'M AN AESTHETICIAN AND MAKE UP ARTIST AT ULTA SALON AND COSMETICS
GuYZuooiVUM_2 0 AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME TIPS ON HOW YOU CAN GET RID OF DARK CIRCLES UNDER THE EYE NATURALLY
GuYZuooiVUM_3 0 ONE OF THE EASIEST THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO TREAT YOUR EYE WITH A COOL CUCUMBER IT'S GOING TO BASICALLY HELP HEAL ANY INFLAMMATION PUFFINESS AND IT'S GOING TO HAVE BRIGHTENING EFFECTS TO THE EYE AREA
GuYZuooiVUM_4 0 ANOTHER THING YOU CAN USE IS CHAMOMILE TEA BREW SOME CHAMOMILE TEA BAGS LET THEM COOL SET THEM ON THE EYE
GuYZuooiVUM_5 0 THEY HELP TO BASICALLY CALM THE EYE TOO AND HAVE SOME BRIGHTENING BENEFITS AS WELL
GuYZuooiVUM_6 0 YOU CAN ALSO DO SOME LYMPHATIC DRAINAGE AROUND THE EYES SO IF YOU JUST TAKE YOUR RING FINGER AND YOU CAN USE ANY TYPE OF EYE CREAM JUST SO YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SOMETHING FOR SLIP
GuYZuooiVUM_7 0 SO YOU DON'T EVERY WANT TO PULL AT THE EYE
GuYZuooiVUM_8 0 SO YOU JUST TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF EYE CREAM AND YOU JUST KIND OF MASSAGE THE EYE WITH YOUR RING FINGER IN A CLOCKWISE MOTION
GuYZuooiVUM_9 0 DO A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE POINT A LOT OF DARK CIRCLES CAN BE CAUSED FROM EITHER SINUS CONGESTION OR JUST BECAUSE THE SKIN IS SO THIN THERE A LOT OF BLOOD LAYING VERY CLOSE TO THE SURFACE
GuYZuooiVUM_10 0 SO JUST MASSAGING THIS AREA HELPS TO DRAIN ANY CONGESTION IT ALSO HELPS TO STIMULATE BLOOD FLOW
GuYZuooiVUM_11 0 SO THAT CAN HELP YOU LIGHTEN DARK CIRCLES AS WELL
GuYZuooiVUM_12 0 SO THOSE ARE SOME TIPS ON THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO NATURALLY DIMINISH THE LOOK OF DARK CIRCLES AROUND THE EYE
GncdILTVo-o_2 0 ON ONE THE PREVIOUS SEGMENTS I TAUGHT SOMETHING CALLED THE HINDU SHUFFLE
GncdILTVo-o_3 0 I WANT TO GIVE YOU A QUICK REVIEW OF IT NOW BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY GOOD SHUFFLE TO USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE STRIPPER DECK
GncdILTVo-o_4 0 BASICALLY YOU HOLD THE CARDS
GncdILTVo-o_5 0 I'M HOLDING THEM IN MY MIDDLE FINGER AND THUMB
GncdILTVo-o_6 0 WE'RE GOING TO PEEL OFF SMALL SECTIONS OF CARDS AND DROP THEM LIKE THIS
GncdILTVo-o_7 0 THAT'S THE HINDU SHUFFLE
GncdILTVo-o_8 0 AT REGULAR SPEED IT LOOKS LIKE THIS
GncdILTVo-o_9 0 I'LL SHOW YOU FROM THIS SIDE
GncdILTVo-o_10 0 NOW THE REASON THIS IS GOOD WITH A STRIPPER DECK IS THAT THERE'LL BE TIMES WHEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO STRIP THE CARD RIGHT OUT AND PUT IT ON TOP OF THE DECK BECAUSE IT'S BEEN REVERSED
GncdILTVo-o_11 0 THAT'S A BASIC REVIEW OF THE HINDU SHUFFLE
GncdILTVo-o_12 0 LATER ON I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW YOU APPLY THAT TO THE STRIPPER OR TAPERED DECK TO SOME TRICKS WITH IT
goTZFLlnBII_1 0 OK TO CENTER THIS MUG ON THE WHEEL WHAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED IS A PIN TOOL
goTZFLlnBII_2 0 WHAT WE DO IS TURN THE WHEEL ON AND SIMPLY PUT THE PIN TOOL ONTO THE MUG
goTZFLlnBII_3 0 YOU CAN SEE WE'RE GOING QUITE SLOWLY HERE
goTZFLlnBII_4 0 HOLD THE PIN TOOL STEADY
goTZFLlnBII_5 0 SIMPLY LET IT GO ACROSS THE SIDE OF THE MUG
goTZFLlnBII_6 0 NOW YOU CAN SEE WHAT I'VE DONE HERE IS I'VE CREATED TWO POINTS WITH THIS LINE
goTZFLlnBII_7 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS LOCATE THOSE TWO POINTS LIKE THIS WITH MY FINGERS AND I'M GOING TO PUSH THE POT SLIGHTLY IN THAT DIRECTION AND THEN I'M GOING TO CHECK IT AGAIN
goTZFLlnBII_8 0 AS YOU CAN SEE NOW THE LINE IS PRETTY MUCH CONSISTENTLY GOING ALL THE WAY AROUND THE POT
goTZFLlnBII_9 0 SO NOW IT'S CENTERED
goTZFLlnBII_10 0 THE NEXT THING TO DO IS SIMPLY SECURE THE MUG TO THE WHEEL
goTZFLlnBII_11 0 YOU'RE GOING TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF MOISTURE THERE
goTZFLlnBII_12 0 TAKE OUT SOME CLAY AND SIMPLY STICK THE MUG DOWN AROUND THE EDGES
goTZFLlnBII_13 0 THIS IS ALSO IMPORTANT REASON WHY WE WANT THIS TOP LIP WET SO THIS WETTER CLAY DOESN'T STICK TO THE MUG
goTZFLlnBII_14 0 WE'RE JUST GOING TO PUT IT IN THREE SPOTS AROUND THE MUG LIKE SO
goTZFLlnBII_15 0 NOTICE HOW I'M STICKING THE CLAY TO THE BAT AND NOT THE POT
goTZFLlnBII_16 0 I'M SIMPLY CREATING A SECURE SPOT FOR THIS TO SIT
goTZFLlnBII_18 0 SO NEXT I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO TRIM A FOOT ON THE BASE OF YOUR MUG
goTZFLlnBII_19 0 WE'LL BE DOING THAT IN THE NEXT SECTION OF THIS LESSON
H0irdM-yLKM_1 0 IN THIS EXAMPLE I'M GOING TO DO ANOTHER RIFF IN A AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS LIKE A LITTLE MINOR PULL OFF WITH THE RIFF AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE ANOTHER KIND OF PULL OFF HAMMER ON IDEA THAT YOU CAN USE IN BETWEEN CHORDS
H0irdM-yLKM_2 0 AND WITH THE DRUMS IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS
H0irdM-yLKM_3 0 SO WITH THAT I'M ACTUALLY USING NOTES OUT OF THE D-MINOR SCALE
H0irdM-yLKM_4 0 AND IF YOU NOTICED I PLAYED A D-MINOR CHORD ADDED WITH THE A5
H0irdM-yLKM_5 0 SO OR YOU COULD ACTUALLY PLAY A-MINOR
H0irdM-yLKM_6 0 AGAIN IT'S AN ACCEPTATION YOU COULD MAKE BECAUSE THIS NOTE IS A-SHARP NORMALLY I MAKE IT WITH THE KEY OF A BUT IN THE KEY OF D-MINOR THIS
H0irdM-yLKM_7 0 SO YOU KNOW IT KIND OF GIVES IT A NICE MINOR FLAVOR THAT YOU CAN PLAY WITH AN A BASED RIFF OUT OF ANOTHER KEY
H0irdM-yLKM_8 0 SO TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER IDEA THEORETICALLY WHAT YOU CAN DO MUSIC THEORY-WISE IS
H0irdM-yLKM_9 0 SO IT HAS A NICE MINOR SOUND SO IT GIVES A NICE DARK TONALITY FOR YOUR RIFF
HHpJy70ro1I_1 0 I SPENT A LOT OF TIME PICKING OUT MY FISH
HHpJy70ro1I_2 0 EXACTLY THE ONE I LIKED AND PERSONALITY WISE SO I WANT HIM TO LIVE LONG
HHpJy70ro1I_3 0 MY NAME IS MICHAEL AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE YOUR GOLDFISH LIVE LONGER
HHpJy70ro1I_4 0 ONE THING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THE QUALITY OF YOUR WATER SO WHENEVER YOU SET UP YOUR WATER TANK YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE USING A PRODUCT THAT'S GOING TO REMOVE THE CHLORINES CHLORAMINES AND AMMONIAS OUT OF YOUR TANK SO WATER QUALITY IS VERY IMPORTANT
HHpJy70ro1I_5 0 WE WANT TO FEED HIM A GOOD FISH FOOD ONE THAT'S RICH IN SEAFOOD PROTEINS LOW IN ASH AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP HIS TANK CLEANED ON A REGULAR BASIS
HHpJy70ro1I_6 0 WHEN YOU DO CLEAN HIS TANK IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON HIM HOW MUCH YOU'RE FEEDING HIM HOW DIRTY HIS BOWL GETS SO IT COULD BE EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS THAT YOU CHANGE HIS WATER OUT
HHpJy70ro1I_7 0 IT COULD BE ONCE A WEEK
HHpJy70ro1I_8 0 AGAIN IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON THE FISH HIMSELF BUT IF YOU TAKE YOUR TANK AND YOU POUR ALL OF HIS CONTENTS INTO ANOTHER BOWL WITH HIM IN IT
HHpJy70ro1I_9 0 YOU CAN THEN TAKE OUT YOUR PLANTS AND YOUR GRAVEL CLEAN THOSE OUT
HHpJy70ro1I_10 0 TAKE YOUR BOWL ITSELF MAKE SURE YOU WASH THAT OUT
HHpJy70ro1I_11 0 DON'T EVER USE SOAP IN IT
HHpJy70ro1I_12 0 REGULAR WATER CLEANING IT OUT RINSING IT REALLY WELL SHOULD BE ALL THAT YOU NEED
HHpJy70ro1I_13 0 SET YOUR TANK BACK UP AGAIN
HHpJy70ro1I_14 0 MAKE SURE YOU USE THE PROPER CHEMICALS IN IT
HHpJy70ro1I_15 0 LET THE WATER ACCLIMATE
HHpJy70ro1I_16 0 LET THE BOWL SIT FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS AND YOU'VE GOT HIM OVER IN YOUR OTHER WATER
HHpJy70ro1I_17 0 USE YOUR NET ONCE THAT TIME HAS BEEN REACHED AND GET HIM OUT OF HIS OLD WATER AND PUT HIM INTO HIS NEW WATER AND FEED HIM
HHpJy70ro1I_18 0 WHEN YOU DO FEED HIM YOU WANT TO FEED HIM ONLY AS MUCH THAT HE'S GOING TO EAT IN JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTE PERIOD AND WE'RE GOING TO LIMIT THAT TO JUST A COUPLE OF TIMES A DAY
HHpJy70ro1I_19 0 LIKE I SAID I REALLY LIKE MY GOLDFISH
HHpJy70ro1I_20 0 IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO PICK OUT EXACTLY THE ONE THAT WAS RIGHT FOR ME SO I WANT HIM TO LIVE QUITE AWHILE
HHpJy70ro1I_21 0 MY NAME IS MICHAEL AND KEEP YOUR GOLDFISH SAFE AND HAPPY AND GIVE THEM A LONG LIFE
GciJgxt_sK8_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO TRY FIRST TO PULL THEIR EXISTING DUCT WORK
GciJgxt_sK8_2 0 I'VE CHECKED WITH ALL THE MECHANICALS IT LOOKS LIKE THIS AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM CAN CARRY THE LOAD OF THIS EXTRA SQUARE FOOTAGE
GciJgxt_sK8_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO TRY THAT FIRST IF WE NEED TO THEN SUPPLEMENT THERE'S SOME GREAT NEW SYSTEMS OUT THAT WE CAN GET INTO IF WE CROSS THAT BRIDGE
GciJgxt_sK8_4 0 WHERE THEY ARE STANDING UNITS THAT WILL HEAT AND AIR THIS ROOM BEAUTIFULLY THAT ARE EASY TO USE TO VENT
GciJgxt_sK8_5 0 THERE ARE EUROPEAN SYSTEMS THAT ARE TERRIFIC AS WELL AND AFFORDABLE
GciJgxt_sK8_6 0 WE'RE GOING TO FIRST TRY TO USE THEIR EXISTING DUCT WORK AND SEE IF THAT DOES AN EFFICIENT JOB
GciJgxt_sK8_7 0 WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS
GciJgxt_sK8_8 0 THE FIRST THING WE'LL BE DOING IS TAKING THIS PLYWOOD OFF THESE WALLS INSULATING FRAMING THEN WE'RE GOING TO RUN OUR NEW ELECTRICAL WE'RE GOING TO RUN PLUGS HERE HERE A ONE TEN AND A TWO TWENTY
GciJgxt_sK8_9 0 YOU NEED THOSE TWO DIFFERENT POWER SOURCES FOR THE WASHER AND DRYER
GciJgxt_sK8_10 0 I HIRED A LICENSED ELECTRICIAN TO DO THESE THINGS I DON'T ATTEMPT ANY OF THAT MYSELF

hjQ3X2PrKWg_1 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO APPLY THE MASCARA
hjQ3X2PrKWg_2 0 BUT BEFORE I WANT TO APPLY MASCARA I WANT TO CURL HER EYELASHES
hjQ3X2PrKWg_3 0 SO I'M GOING TO MOVE IN
hjQ3X2PrKWg_4 0 SO JUST CURL YOUR EYELASHES BY GETTING AS CLOSE TO THE LID AS POSSIBLE AND SQUEEZING
hjQ3X2PrKWg_5 0 AND THEN OPENING IT UP AND THEN YOU'RE CURLED
hjQ3X2PrKWg_6 0 YOU WANT TO CURL YOUR EYELASHES BEFORE APPLY MASCARA BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO REALLY OPEN UP YOUR EYES
hjQ3X2PrKWg_7 0 AND LOOK DOWN
hjQ3X2PrKWg_8 0 SO I'M STARTING AT THE BASE OF HER LASHES AND THEN WORKING MY WAY UP TO THE ENDS

hjQ3X2PrKWg_12 0 BECAUSE YOU WANT JUST A REALLY LIGHT APPLICATION
hjQ3X2PrKWg_13 0 OK AND THAT'S HOW YOU APPLY THE MASCARA
HFDQWoH0Ucw_1 0 O.K GUYS NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO IN TO OUR FIRST STRETCH
HFDQWoH0Ucw_2 0 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO STRETCH BEFORE YOU DO THIS STUFF EVEN THOUGH IT IS MORE UPPER BODY YOU CAN STILL THROW SOME THINGS OUT OF WHACK
HFDQWoH0Ucw_3 0 SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO FIRST IS YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR BO YOU WANT TO SPLIT IT IN TO THIRDS
HFDQWoH0Ucw_4 0 YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR HAND OUT THIS WAY
HFDQWoH0Ucw_5 0 YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR LEFT HAND FACING YOU YOUR RIGHT HAND IS GOING TO BE FACING AWAY
HFDQWoH0Ucw_6 0 AND YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUSH OUT TO THE SIDE LIKE THIS AND THEN DROP YOUR HAND TO THE INSIDE SO YOU HAVE THIS TWIST MOTION
HFDQWoH0Ucw_7 0 AND I'LL DO THAT FROM THE SIDE SO YOU CAN SEE THAT
HFDQWoH0Ucw_8 0 SO YOU'RE HOLDING HERE YOU PUSH OUT OFF TO ONE SIDE AND YOU'RE GOING TO DROP IN THIS WAY
HFDQWoH0Ucw_9 0 AND WHAT THAT'S GOING TO DO IS THAT'S GOING TO STRETCH ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE TOP OF THIS MUSCLE HERE
HFDQWoH0Ucw_10 0 THIS IS YOUR BIG TORQUE MUSCLE AND WHEN YOU START GOING IN TO FIGURE EIGHTS AND WRIST ROLLS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE WORKING
HFDQWoH0Ucw_11 0 SO YOU'RE JUST GOING TO COME HERE DROP IT IN FRONT AND TWIST OVER
HFDQWoH0Ucw_12 0 YOU WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE GETTING IN TO THESE BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL PUSH TOO HARD TOO FAST AND YOU START FEELING PAINS AROUND YOUR JOINTS IN THE ELBOW AND THE WRIST
HFDQWoH0Ucw_13 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T FEEL THAT
HFDQWoH0Ucw_14 0 IF IT FEELS LIKE ITS COMING TOO HARD AND ITS HURTING YOU JUST WANT TO SHORTEN IT UP A LITTLE BIT
HFDQWoH0Ucw_15 0 COME HERE OR GO TO A DIFFERENT STRETCH
HFDQWoH0Ucw_16 0 SO THAT'S WHERE IT IS RIGHT THERE
gHdm6TMzeJU_1 0 IF A PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH GUM DISEASE THERE'S A MULTITUDE OF WAYS TO TREAT THIS GUM DISEASE
gHdm6TMzeJU_2 0 THE MOST TYPICAL ONE THAT A DENTIST WILL PRESCRIBE ARE WHAT'S CALLED SCALING AND ROOT PLANING ALSO KNOWN AS DEEP CLEANINGS
gHdm6TMzeJU_3 0 THE PURPOSE OF THE DEEP CLEANINGS ARE TO BASICALLY REMOVE ALL DEBRIS AND BUILDUP THAT OCCURS ABOVE AND BELOW THE GUM LINE AND THE TEETH
gHdm6TMzeJU_4 0 WE KNOW THAT THAT IS ULTIMATELY THE PROBLEM WHICH WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO TO TO THE GUM DISEASE SUCH AS GINGIVITIS BONE LOSS TEETH BEING LOST AND LOOSE
gHdm6TMzeJU_5 0 AND IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN WE DO THESE DEEP CLEANINGS THAT WE GO IN THERE AND REMOVE ALL OF THE IRRITATING FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS GUM DISEASE
gHdm6TMzeJU_6 0 SO IN THIS MODEL WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF THIS TOOTH THAT ACTUALLY HAS GUM DISEASE AND WE CHARACTERIZE GUM DISEASE BY A COUPLE THINGS
gHdm6TMzeJU_7 0 ONE IS THAT WE HAVE LOTS OF BUILDUP DOWN RIGHT HERE AROUND THE GUM LINE
gHdm6TMzeJU_8 0 SECONDLY THE TISSUE IS VERY RED INFLAMED AND TENDER AND ALSO BLEEDS A LITTLE BIT MORE FREQUENTLY THAN NORMAL
gHdm6TMzeJU_9 0 WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WHEN WE DO OUR DEEP CLEANINGS IS WE'RE REMOVING ALL OF THESE THIS BUILDUP AROUND THE TEETH
gHdm6TMzeJU_10 0 SO IN A TYPICAL APPOINTMENT THE PATIENT WILL COME IN THE DENTIST WILL NUMB THE PATIENT UP TO MAKE THEM COMFORTABLE
gHdm6TMzeJU_11 0 AND TYPICALLY THE HYGIENIST WILL BE THE ONE THAT PERFORMS THE DEEP CLEANINGS
gHdm6TMzeJU_12 0 IN A DEEP CLEANING WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE TAKING SEVERAL DIFFERENT CLEANING INSTRUMENTS AND PLACING IT ACROSS THE TOOTH WHERE THE BUILDUP IS AND REMOVING THE BUILDUP
gHdm6TMzeJU_13 0 SO HERE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THIS BUILDUP BUT AS WE TAKE OUR INSTRUMENT THROUGH HERE WE ARE GOING TO GENTLY PULL SOME OF THIS MATERIAL OFF THE TOOTH JUST LIKE SO AND KIND OF AS IN THE LIGHT SCRAPING MOTION WE'RE REMOVING ALL OF THIS BUILDUP AROUND THE TEETH
gHdm6TMzeJU_14 0 BY REMOVING THE BUILDUP THAT WILL HELP CURE THE GUM DISEASE AND GET THE TISSUE INTO A MORE STABLE AND COMFORTABLE CONDITION LIKE SO
gHdm6TMzeJU_15 0 ONCE THE DEEP CLEANINGS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED WE WILL BASICALLY BRING THE PATIENT BACK ROUGHLY ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE WEEKS LATER AFTER THE TREATMENT HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND WE WILL REEVALUATE THE GUMS
gHdm6TMzeJU_16 0 THE THINGS THAT WE LOOK AT ARE THE TISSUE COLOR IS IS THE TISSUE NICE AND PINK OR IS IT STILL RED
gHdm6TMzeJU_17 0 IS IT NICE AND TIGHT OR IS IT INFLAMED AND SWOLLEN
gHdm6TMzeJU_18 0 AND HOW MUCH BLEEDING DO WE HAVE
gHdm6TMzeJU_19 0 HAS THE BLEEDING DECREASED SINCE WE INITIALLY EVALUATED IT
gHdm6TMzeJU_20 0 PROVIDED ALL THOSE THINGS HAVE IMPROVED AND RESPONDED THEN THAT IS THE FIRST STEPS IN TREATING THE GUM DISEASE
gHdm6TMzeJU_21 0 ONCE WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT WE HAVE THAT IN A STABLE CONDITION THE NEXT STEP IS TO GET THE PATIENT IN A MORE FREQUENT RECALL INTERVAL WHERE THEY'RE GETTING MORE FREQUENT CLEANINGS
gHdm6TMzeJU_22 0 THIS CAN BE AS AS MUCH AS EVERY THREE MONTHS TO AS LITTLE AS EVERY SIX MONTHS AND IT DEPENDS FROM PATIENT TO PATIENT BASED ON HOW MUCH TREATMENT WE THINK WILL BE NECESSARY
GiuaUeZM1fo_2 0 THIS IS A TYPICAL CAMERA TRIPOD AND NORMALLY THEY'RE UNDER FIFTY DOLLARS
GiuaUeZM1fo_3 0 AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN EVEN GET THEM UNDER THIRTY DOLLARS
GiuaUeZM1fo_4 0 NOW THEY HAVE EASY TO DO RELEASE SO THAT YOU COULD LOCK THEM DOWN AT ANY LENGTH
GiuaUeZM1fo_5 0 IN THE PAST THEY'VE HAD SORT OF SCREW MECHANISMS HERE WHICH WERE NOT QUICK AND WERE NOT THAT EASY
GiuaUeZM1fo_6 0 BUT NOW THEY HAVE BETTER ONES
GiuaUeZM1fo_7 0 AND THESE ARE GENERALLY MADE OUT OF ALUMINUM
GiuaUeZM1fo_8 0 AND DEPENDING ON WHAT GRADE AND HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO SPEND YOU MAY GET THICKER ALUMINUM WHICH MAKES IT HEAVIER
GiuaUeZM1fo_9 0 THESE HAVE ROTATING CUPS ON BALL JOINTS
GiuaUeZM1fo_10 0 SOME OF THEM HAVE LITTLE SPIKES THAT WILL UNSCREW THROUGH THE FOOT
GiuaUeZM1fo_11 0 THIS ONE DOESN'T HAVE THAT
GiuaUeZM1fo_12 0 SO THAT IF YOU NEED TO BE ON CARPET YOU WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SLIDING OR MOVING ANY
GiuaUeZM1fo_13 0 THIS ONE HAS GOT A NOT A FLUID HEAD BUT IT TRIES TO HAVE A FLUID HEAD
GiuaUeZM1fo_14 0 AND WITH JUST A STILL CAMERA UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO BE SHOOTING MOVIES THEN YOU REALLY DON'T NEED A FLUID HEAD
hG5cyaHJcLA_1 0 DAVID GREEN HI
hG5cyaHJcLA_2 0 MY NAME IS DAVID GREEN WITH EXPERTVILLAGE.COM AND I WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PRICING OUT OUR JOB
hG5cyaHJcLA_3 0 AS FAR AS FOR OUR COMPANY WE PRIMARILY PRICE BY THE ROOM
hG5cyaHJcLA_4 0 THERE ARE VARIATIONS OF THAT WHERE WE HAVE IF A ROOM IS SMALLER THAN A CERTAIN SIZE WE WILL CONSIDER IT A HALF-ROOM OR IF IT'S LARGER THAN A CERTAIN SIZE WE WILL CONSIDERATE IT AS MORE THAN ONE ROOM AND THEN WE DO ROOM SPECIALS
hG5cyaHJcLA_5 0 WHAT'S IDEAL ABOUT THIS IS YOU CAN PRICE OUT MOST JOBS OVER THE PHONE WITHOUT HAVING TO GO OUT AND GIVE AN ESTIMATE
hG5cyaHJcLA_6 0 THE OTHER OPTION OF COURSE THAT A LOT OF COMPANIES DO IS SQUARE FOOTAGE PRICING WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY MEASURING EVERYTHING
hG5cyaHJcLA_7 0 AS FAR AS WITH THIS ROOM IT'S A FAIRLY LARGE BEDROOM BUT OF COURSE WE JUST WOULD JUST PRICE THIS AS ONE ROOM
hG5cyaHJcLA_8 0 WE THEN PRICE HALLWAYS BY THE LINEAR FOOT TO WHERE WE MEASURE THE LENGTH AND TIMES THAT BY OUR RATE
hG5cyaHJcLA_9 0 STAIRS WE PRICE PER STEP
hG5cyaHJcLA_10 0 SO FOR US THE ONLY TIMES WE'RE REALLY MEASURING WE'LL COME IN WITH A MEASURING STICK THAT ROLLS ALONG THE CARPET
hG5cyaHJcLA_11 0 WE WILL USE THAT TO DETERMINE IF A ROOM IS SMALLER THAN A NORMAL ROOM OR LARGER THAN A NORMAL ROOM OR LIKE I SAID THE LENGTH OF HALLWAYS
hG5cyaHJcLA_12 0 AND THEN WE HAVE A PER-ROOM PRICE FOR OUR PRODUCTS LIKE SANITIZER OR CARPET PROTECTOR
hG5cyaHJcLA_13 0 AND THERE'S QUITE A FEW SERVICES THAT YOU CAN GET INTO AS YOU PROVIDE A QUALITY SERVICE IN A THOROUGH SERVICE OR WHEN YOU REALLY GET INTO ALL OF THE THINGS THAT CUSTOMERS MIGHT BE IN NEED OF TO FIX CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OR SPECIAL CLEANING NEEDS
hG5cyaHJcLA_14 0 AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO IMPLEMENT A PRICE GUIDANCE
hG5cyaHJcLA_15 0 WITH US BETWEEN ALL THESE SERVICES BETWEEN CARPETS AND UPHOLSTERY WE'VE GOT TWO PAGES OF PRICES THEN WE GET INTO ABOUT A HALF PAGE OF TILE CLEANING HALF PAGE OF AIR DUCT CLEANING AND ABOUT A PAGE OF WINDOW ABOUT A PAGE AND A HALF BETWEEN WINDOW AND BLIND CLEANING
hG5cyaHJcLA_16 0 AND WHAT YOU ULTIMATELY HAVE TO DO IS FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS BEST FOR YOUR MARKET AS WELL AS WHAT WORKS BEST FOR YOU CAUSE PRETTY MUCH IN ANY MARKET THEY'RE GOING TO PROBABLY PRICE THINGS OUT BOTH WAYS DEPENDING ON THE COMPANY
h1ohswSdVZs_1 0 WHAT I'LL BE PERFORMING HERE IS THE OVERHEAD TRICEPS DUMBBELL EXTENSION
h1ohswSdVZs_2 0 PRETTY MUCH IT'S CALLED THE OVERHEAD BECAUSE YOU'RE BRINGING IT OVER YOUR HEAD
h1ohswSdVZs_3 0 FLEX THE TRICEPS ON TOP
h1ohswSdVZs_4 0 WHEN YOU BRING IT DOWN YOU'RE STRETCHING IT OUT
h1ohswSdVZs_5 0 SO YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU CONTROL IT
h1ohswSdVZs_6 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO EXTEND IT WITH YOUR ARM STRAIGHT OUT YOU WANT TO STILL KEEP IT A LITTLE BENT
h1ohswSdVZs_7 0 CONTROL IT COMING DOWN GIVE IT A GOOD SQUEEZE A GOOD STRETCH
h1ohswSdVZs_8 0 BRING IT OUT GIVE IT A GOOD FLEX ON TOP
h1ohswSdVZs_9 0 CONTINUE THIS ABOUT EIGHT REPETITIONS ABOUT EIGHT TO TEN AND ABOUT THREE SETS
h1ohswSdVZs_10 0 THEN YOU WANT TO CHANGE IT SWITCH ARMS DO THE SAME MOTION
h1ohswSdVZs_11 0 NOW IF YOUR ARMS ARE GETTING TIRED AND YOU NEED SOME SUPPORT YOU CAN USE THE OTHER HAND TO KIND OF HOLD YOUR ARMS STRAIGHT AND CONTINUE TO THAT MOTION FLEXING THE TRICEPS AND STRETCHING IT OUT
h1ohswSdVZs_12 0 AND THAT'S THE OVERHEAD TRICEPS EXTENSION

GlEkuiwlE20_1 0 FOR PREPARATION WHEN YOU'RE CONDUCTING AN ORCHESTRA THE CONDUCTOR NEEDS TO BE FAIRLY COMPETENT AT CERTAIN SKILLS
GlEkuiwlE20_2 0 SO THESE ARE THINGS HE MIGHT WANT TO BRUSH UP ON
GlEkuiwlE20_3 0 THE CONDUCTOR NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO DO THE FOLLOWING YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO READ A FULL SCORE
GlEkuiwlE20_4 0 A FULL SCORE HAS ALL THE PARTS OF THE ENSEMBLE IF IT'S A STRING ORCHESTRA IT HAS THE VIOLIN VIOLA CELLO'S DOUBLE BASE AND IF IT'S A SYMPHONIC ORCHESTRA IT WILL HAVE ALL THE STRINGS THE WOOD WINDS AND THE BRASS AND PERCUSSION
GlEkuiwlE20_5 0 THE CONDUCTOR ALSO HAS TO KIND OF HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE CAPABILITIES OF THE INSTRUMENTS

GlEkuiwlE20_7 0 RHYTHM AND ACCURACIES AS WELL
GlEkuiwlE20_8 0 THEY NEED TO AFFECTIVELY BLEND THE ENSEMBLE IN RESPECT WITH THE MUSIC AND THEY NEED TO USE CLEAR CONDUCTING GESTURES

gE1nShlv6mo_6 0 THIS IS ACTUALLY A PROFESSIONAL ONE
gE1nShlv6mo_7 0 CREATES A LOT OF STEAM
gE1nShlv6mo_8 0 ALL I HAD TO DO WAS PUT WATER IN THE RECEPTACLE AND TURN IT ON AND LOOK AT THIS STEAM IT'S GREAT
gE1nShlv6mo_9 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS JUST TAKE THE STEAMER AND GO RIGHT DOWN HOW SIMPLE IS THAT
gE1nShlv6mo_10 0 RIGHT DOWN THE SHIRT LOOK IT HOW QUICKLY IT GETS OUT THOSE LINES
gE1nShlv6mo_11 0 LOOK AT THAT
gE1nShlv6mo_12 0 NOW SOMETIME I DO THIS AGAINST A FLAT WALL SO IT'S A FLAT SURFACE OR YOU CAN USE THE EDGE ITSELF LIKE THAT TO MAKE A FLAT LINE
gE1nShlv6mo_13 0 LOOK AT HOW QUICKLY THOSE LINES COME OUT
gE1nShlv6mo_14 0 REMEMBER IT'S VERY HOT SO KEEP THE STEAM AWAY FROM YOUR FACE AND YOUR FINGERS
gE1nShlv6mo_15 0 SOMETIMES I PUT THIS UP AGAINST A FLAT SURFACE OR I USE THE EDGE HERE TO MAKE A FLAT SURFACE
gE1nShlv6mo_16 0 GREAT STEAM GOING
gE1nShlv6mo_17 0 IT'S REALLY SIMPLE
gE1nShlv6mo_18 0 JUST QUICK GOING DOWN

gE1nShlv6mo_23 0 THIS IS A TRAVEL VERSION OF THIS STEAMER
gE1nShlv6mo_24 0 IT'S OF COURSE NOT AS POWERFUL
gE1nShlv6mo_25 0 IT'S REALLY LIGHT WEIGHT EASY TO PACK IT DOESN'T TAKE UP MUCH ROOM AT ALL
gE1nShlv6mo_26 0 IT'LL HELP YOU GET THOSE WRINKLES OUT BECAUSE YOU KNOW EVERY TIME YOU PACK YOU GET WRINKLES

Ga5NKgjslZo_1 0 JASON SHERIDAN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS JASON SHERIDAN FROM THE SHERIDAN FENCING ACADEMY HERE IN NEW YORK CITY AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO DEMONSTRATE SOME INTERMEDIATE SABRE FENCING
Ga5NKgjslZo_2 0 SABRE IS ONE OF THREE WEAPONS FENCED IN THE OLYMPICS
Ga5NKgjslZo_3 0 IT COMES FROM CAVALRY WEAPONS PEOPLE ON HORSES POINTING OUT THEIR SWORDS AND CHARGE AND LATER DEVELOPED INTO A DUELING WEAPON ESPECIALLY IN EASTERN EUROPE
Ga5NKgjslZo_4 0 THE SABRE IS WELL THIS IS A SABRE
Ga5NKgjslZo_5 0 IT IS A CUTTING WEAPON
Ga5NKgjslZo_6 0 YOU USE THE EDGE OF THE WEAPON OR THE TIP TO SCORE A POINT
Ga5NKgjslZo_7 0 THE TARGET AREA IS FROM THE WAIST UP INCLUDING THE HEAD AND TO SCORE AS I SAID YOU MAKE CUTS TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF YOUR OPPONENT'S TARGET OKAY
Ga5NKgjslZo_8 0 AS YOU SEE THERE'S A GUARD THAT IS CURLED WHICH CAN PROTECT YOUR HAND AND HELP YOU PARRING HELP YOU BLOCK YOUR OPPONENT'S ATTACKS
Ga5NKgjslZo_10 0 UNLIKE THE MOVIES WHERE THE FENCING IS MOSTLY SWORD PLAY REAL FENCING IS ABOUT THE WAY YOU MOVE YOUR FEET WHICH WE'LL SEE IN A MOMENT
GCcBxa4jyGU_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON BOTH THE CORE AND TWISTING
GCcBxa4jyGU_2 0 IT'S CALLED THE SIMPLE SPINAL TWIST
GCcBxa4jyGU_3 0 IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS IT SOUNDS
GCcBxa4jyGU_4 0 SO HERE'S AMY SHE'S LAYING DOWN HER ARMS ARE OUT TO A T
GCcBxa4jyGU_5 0 SHE'S LAYING ON HER BACK WITH HER KNEES BENT
GCcBxa4jyGU_6 0 SHE'S GOING TO INHALE DRAW BOTH KNEES IN TOWARDS HER HEART AND THEN AS SHE EXHALES SHE IS GOING TO REACH BOTH KNEES SIMULTANEOUSLY OVER TOWARDS HER RIGHT HAND
GCcBxa4jyGU_7 0 THEN ON AN INHALE SHE'S GOING TO REACH BOTH KNEES BACK UP AND THEN EXHALE SHE'S GOING TO REACH THE KNEES OUT TO HER OTHER SIDE
GCcBxa4jyGU_8 0 HER LEFT HAND
GCcBxa4jyGU_9 0 BE MINDFUL TO KEEP THE OTHER SHOULDER OPPOSITE SHOULDER DOWN
GCcBxa4jyGU_10 0 INHALE LIFT UP EXHALE ONCE MORE OVER
GCcBxa4jyGU_11 0 IT'S A GREAT ABDOMINAL TWIST
GCcBxa4jyGU_12 0 INHALE ONCE MORE
GCcBxa4jyGU_13 0 COME BACK TO CENTER
GCcBxa4jyGU_14 0 LAST TIME REACHING THE KNEE TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE
GCcBxa4jyGU_15 0 INHALE COME BACK TO CENTER EXHALE RELEASE YOUR FEET BACK ON TO THE GROUND
HATpkbud9m8_2 0 MY NAME IS AUSTIN SHEPARD HERE WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
HATpkbud9m8_3 0 TODAY I AM GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT GROOMING YOUR PLANT
HATpkbud9m8_4 0 YOU KNOW IF YOU JUST HAVE A PLANT TAKE CARE OF IT AND WATER IT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT IS ALWAYS GOING TO LOOK THE BEST THAT IT CAN
HATpkbud9m8_5 0 YOU ARE GOING TO NEED TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT INTO
HATpkbud9m8_6 0 SO WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO GROOM A PLANT HERE ARE SOME TOOLS THAT YOU WILL NEED A PAIR OF SCISSORS SOME SORT OF CLOTH TO MAYBE WIPE OFF THE DIRT OF A PLANT IF THERE IS A LOT OF DIRT CAKED ON AND A LITTLE FEATHER DUSTER BECAUSE SOMETIMES IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF PLANTS AND THEY ARE INDOORS AND ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE IN A PUBLIC PLACE THEY ARE GOING TO GET A LOT OF DUST ALL OVER THEM
HATpkbud9m8_7 0 SO ALL YOU NEED TO DO SOMETIMES MAYBE ONCE A WEEK DUST IT OFF
HATpkbud9m8_8 0 IT IS REAL EASY IT DOESN'T TAKE ANY THOUGHT WHATSOEVER PUT AWAY YOUR DUSTER TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT YOUR PLANT
HATpkbud9m8_9 0 IT LOOKS A LOT SHINIER NOW AND I'VE NOTICED A COUPLE OF YELLOW LEAVES
HATpkbud9m8_10 0 SO THIS IS A PRETTY SMALL PLANT TO BE DOING THIS ON
HATpkbud9m8_11 0 YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO CHOOSE A MUCH LARGER PLANT WITH A LARGER LEAF LET'S SAY THIS ONE AND YOU ARE GOING TO CUT OFF THE YELLOWING TIPS BUT YOU ARE GOING TO CUT THEM OFF IN A WAY THAT KEEPS THE PLANT LEAF SHAPED
HATpkbud9m8_12 0 SO YOU ARE GOING TO CUT A LITTLE BIT OFF OF THIS SIDE AND A LITTLE BIT OFF OF THIS SIDE
HATpkbud9m8_13 0 LOOK AT THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THE PLANT IS BRAND NEW AND THRIVING
HATpkbud9m8_14 0 IT DOESN'T HURT THE PLANT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HELP THE PLANT BUT IT HELPS YOUR PIECE OF MIND
HATpkbud9m8_15 0 WE ARE LOOKING AT A PLANT THAT DOESN'T HAVE YELLOWING LEAVES
GyXb5y1Cuas_1 0 I'M JASON SHOEMAKER AT SLUG FEST PRINTMAKING WORKSHOP
GyXb5y1Cuas_2 0 I'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SETTING UP THE PRESS FOR INTAGLIO PRINTMAKING
GyXb5y1Cuas_3 0 IN INTAGLIO WE RELY ON WOOL FELT BLANKETS TO TRANSFER THE ENERGY FROM THE DRUM TO OUR PRINTING MATRIX
GyXb5y1Cuas_4 0 THERE'S THREE FELTS
GyXb5y1Cuas_5 0 THIS IS YOUR STARCH CATCHER AND THIS IS GOING TO TAKE ANY OF THE EXTRA MOISTURE FROM THE PAPER AS IT'S ACTUALLY PRINTED AND IT'S ON BOTTOM
GyXb5y1Cuas_6 0 THE SECOND IS YOUR PRESSURE FELT AND THIS ACTUALLY IS A BIT THICKER THAN THE OTHER ONES AND IT'S GOING TO ALLOW THAT PAPER TO BE MOLDED DOWN INTO THE MATRIX AND PULL OUT THE INK
GyXb5y1Cuas_7 0 AND THE LAST FELT IS YOUR PUSHER FELT AND THIS ONE ACTUALLY GOES UP AGAINST THE DRUM IS GOING TO TAKE THE BEATING FROM THE DRUM
GyXb5y1Cuas_8 0 IT'S NOT A REAL BEATING BUT
GyXb5y1Cuas_9 0 IT'S WOVEN SO IT'S A LITTLE STURDIER THAN THE OTHER FELTS
GyXb5y1Cuas_10 0 AND WHEN SETTING UP THE FELTS YOU WANT TO STAGGER THEM LIKE SO
GyXb5y1Cuas_11 0 IF YOU HAD THEM ALL SQUARE ON TOP EACH OTHER IT WOULD HIT THAT IT WOULD HIT THE DRUM AND IT WOULDN'T GO UNDER THERE IT WOULD JUST KEEP PUSHING THE FELTS BACK
GyXb5y1Cuas_12 0 ONE THING I LIKE TO DO WHEN PRINTING IS KEEP THE FELTS LOCKED INTO THE UNDER THE DRUM
GyXb5y1Cuas_13 0 THIS DOES A COUPLE THINGS
GyXb5y1Cuas_14 0 WE GOT OUR FELTS STAGGERED BUFF THEM UP TO THE DRUM AND RUN THEM THROUGH JUST A LITTLE JUST SO THEY'RE HANGING IN THERE AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO COME BACK OUT
GyXb5y1Cuas_15 0 WHAT THIS DOES IT LOCKS THEM IN THERE AND IT KEEPS THEM FROM PUSHING BACK ON YOUR PRINT
GyXb5y1Cuas_16 0 ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR PRINT ON THERE AND YOUR PAPER IF THESE WEREN'T LOCKED IN THERE THE WHOLE THING WOULD MOVE AND YOUR REGISTRATION AND YOUR PAPER WOULD BE THROWN OUT OF SKEW
GyXb5y1Cuas_17 0 NOW THAT THAT'S SET UP WE GOT OUR FELTS LOCKED IN THERE JUST PULL THEM OVER THE DRUM AND YOU'RE READY TO DO SOME PRINTING
HAeg9nVrfz0_1 0 ALL RIGHT WE JUST COVERED IKKYO NOW WE'LL DO NIKKYO
HAeg9nVrfz0_2 0 AS HE GRABS SAME MOTION
HAeg9nVrfz0_3 0 NOW WE CAN DO NIKKYO TO THE TOP HAND OR THE BOTTOM HAND
HAeg9nVrfz0_4 0 IT'S UP TO YOU
HAeg9nVrfz0_5 0 LET'S SHOW THE TOP HAND
HAeg9nVrfz0_6 0 HERE RAISE THIS HAND UP
HAeg9nVrfz0_7 0 HE WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP YOU FROM LIFTING THIS HAND UP PLUS YOU'RE IN MOTION SO THAT'S PROBABLY A MOOT POINT
HAeg9nVrfz0_8 0 HERE TOUCH THE HANDS THE WRIST GOES DOWN RIGHT INTO THE PIN
HAeg9nVrfz0_10 0 ONE TWO THREE
HAeg9nVrfz0_11 0 NOW THE BOTTOM HAND
HAeg9nVrfz0_13 0 SO YOU ALWAYS HAVE AN OPTION
HAeg9nVrfz0_14 0 REMEMBER AVOID THE ATTACK CONTROL THE SITUATION MAKE YOUR CHOICE CHOOSE YOUR OPTION
HAeg9nVrfz0_15 0 THAT'S MY CHOICE THAT'S WHAT I GO WITH
HAeg9nVrfz0_16 0 NOW IN MOTION
gjduiJhT2o4_1 0 AGAIN I WANT TO GO OVER A FEW THINGS AS FAR AS SEATING ARRANGEMENTS IN THE CANOE
gjduiJhT2o4_2 0 YOU ALWAYS WANT TO PUT YOUR PARTICIPANT OR THE LEAST EXPERIENCED CANOER IN THE VERY FRONT OF THE CANOE
gjduiJhT2o4_3 0 THE PERSON IN THE FRONT OF THE CANOE ACTS AS THE MOTOR
gjduiJhT2o4_4 0 NEXT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PARTICIPANT WITH THE DISABILITY SIT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CANOE AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE AT A LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY LIKE PAUL IS
gjduiJhT2o4_5 0 AND EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE SEEN EXAMPLES OF OUR ADAPTIVE PADDLE WHEEL OUR ADAPTIVE GRIPS JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE'S IN THE CANOE DOESN'T MEAN THEY ALSO HAVE TO BE PADDLING
gjduiJhT2o4_6 0 A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE JUST ENJOY THE EXPERIENCE OF GLIDING OVER THE WATER LOOKING AT THE SCENERY
gjduiJhT2o4_7 0 AND SO IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO ENGAGE YOUR PARTICIPANTS WITH A PADDLE BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS NECESSARY AS LONG AS YOU HAVE YOUR MOTOR IN THE FRONT AND THEN ALSO I'M OUT OF THIS GROUP I'M THE MOST EXPERIENCED PADDLER SO I'M GOING TO BE IN THE BACK AND WHEN I PADDLE I'M USING THE DIFFERENT STROKES WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AS FAR AS THE FORWARD STROKE THE BACKWARD STROKE THE J STROKE AND I'M ALSO MAYBE JUST LEAVING MY PADDLE BACK IN THE WATER AND PULLING IT IN AND OUT LIKE THIS IN THE WATER TO HELP STEER THE CANOE
gjduiJhT2o4_8 0 AND SO ALWAYS THINK ABOUT YOUR SEATING ARRANGEMENTS BEFORE YOU GO CANOEING
gjduiJhT2o4_9 0 ONE OTHER ISSUE WE COME ACROSS WHEN DOING ADAPTABLE AND ACCESSIBLE CANOEING IS SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME PARTICIPANTS THAT ARE OVERWEIGHT
gjduiJhT2o4_10 0 AND SO YOU WANT TO ADJUST THEIR WEIGHT IN THE CANOE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ALSO
gjduiJhT2o4_11 0 SO INSTEAD OF HAVING PAUL BACK HERE WITH ME SOMETIMES WHAT WE MIGHT DO IS WE'LL READJUST THIS SEAT AND PUT IT RIGHT BEHIND BRELYND AND INSTEAD OF FACING FORWARD PAUL WOULD THEN BE FACING ME
gjduiJhT2o4_12 0 THAT WAY I CAN GIVE VERBAL COMMANDS TO PAUL AS FAR AS IF HE HAS TO SHIFT HIS WEIGHT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND IT'S ALSO AN EASIER WAY TO TALK BACK AND FORTH WITH SOMEONE WHILE YOU'RE CANOEING BECAUSE YOU CAN BE FACE TO FACE
gjduiJhT2o4_13 0 SO JUST TAKE THOSE THINGS IN CONSIDERATION AS WELL WHEN YOU'RE DOING CANEOING
H70RZcxlhLM_2 0 I'M JENNIFER KIMBALL AND ONE BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO ORGANIZE AND MAINTAIN YOUR BOOK COLLECTION
H70RZcxlhLM_3 0 IF YOUR COLLECTION OF BOOKS HAS LOTS OF DIFFERENT SUBJECT AREAS
H70RZcxlhLM_4 0 MAYBE YOU HAVE A LARGER COLLECTION OF NON-FICTION THAN FICTION THEN ONE WAY WHICH MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO ORGANIZE YOUR BOOKS IS BY SUBJECT MANNER
H70RZcxlhLM_5 0 WITHIN SUBJECT MANNER YOU CAN ALSO ALPHABETIZE
H70RZcxlhLM_6 0 BY DIVIDING OUR BOOKS UP BY THIS TYPE OF GENRE IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE EASIER TO FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
H70RZcxlhLM_7 0 FOR INSTANCE SAY YOU WERE A MATH MAJOR IN COLLEGE AND YOU HAVE ALL OF YOUR MATH BOOKS STILL BECAUSE THEY'RE RELEVANT
H70RZcxlhLM_8 0 YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THOSE SEPARATE FROM SAY SOME OF YOUR FICTION OR IF YOU HAVE SOME ART BOOKS
H70RZcxlhLM_9 0 THIS WAY YOU'RE KEEPING DIFFERENT TYPES OF BOOKS SEPARATE FROM ONE ANOTHER SO THEY THEY'RE EASIER TO FIND
H70RZcxlhLM_10 0 THIS ALSO WORKS WELL IF YOU HAVE A LARGER SUBJECT AND THEN YOU HAVE SUB-GENRES WITHIN THAT SUBJECT
H70RZcxlhLM_11 0 IF YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF HISTORY BOOKS BUT THEN YOU HAVE DIVIDED BY EITHER WAR OR BY A DIFFERENT COUNTRY
H70RZcxlhLM_12 0 THERE ARE VARIOUS DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU CAN DIVIDE THINGS UP BY SUBJECT MANNER WHICH IS GOING TO MAKE THE MOST SENSE TO YOU
g7vqJY33u8I_2 0 MY NAME IS NANCY ADLER ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE

g7vqJY33u8I_10 0 THE AUDITORIUM SEATS A 160 PEOPLE
g7vqJY33u8I_11 0 MY FAVORITE NIGHTS ARE THE NIGHTS WHEN EVERY SEAT IS FULL AND WE HAVE TO TURN PEOPLE AWAY BUT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN TOO OFTEN
g7vqJY33u8I_12 0 USUALLY WE HAVE HALF TO THREE-QUARTERS FULL SO THAT'S A GOOD NIGHT

GQ1RQefuOao_1 0 DREW NOAH SO NOW I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FINAL EDITOR IN CELTX
GQ1RQefuOao_2 0 AND OF COURSE EVERYTHING I'VE SHOWED YOU SO FAR LIKE THE SCREENPLAY STAGE PLAY THE AUDIO-VIDEO SCRIPT AND THE AUDIO PLAY SCRIPT ARE VERY SPECIFIC FORMATTING IN THIS DROP DOWN MENU RIGHT
GQ1RQefuOao_3 0 EVERY THING HAS GOT TO BE IN THE CORRECT FORMATTING
GQ1RQefuOao_4 0 AND OF COURSE FOR A CORRECTLY FORMATTED SCREENPLAY THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT
GQ1RQefuOao_5 0 SO THAT'S GREAT THAT CELTX DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S JUST BASICALLY A FREE SCREENWRITING SOFTWARE
GQ1RQefuOao_6 0 BUT YOU ALSO MAYBE JUST NEED TO WRITE SOME REGULAR TEXT SO THEY DO OFFER A TEXT EDITOR JUST A PLAIN TEXT EDITOR
GQ1RQefuOao_7 0 AND YOU SEE ITS RIGHT HERE UNDER THE SELECT ITEM OPTION AND I'VE ALREADY GOT ONE OPEN FROM THEIR OWN EXAMPLE
GQ1RQefuOao_8 0 AND IT'S JUST ANY KIND OF PLAIN OLD TEXT YOU NEED TO DO THIS IS WHAT THIS WILL BE GOOD FOR
GQ1RQefuOao_9 0 IN THIS EXAMPLE THEY'RE USING IT AS A STORY OUTLINE AND YOU CAN SEE THEY'VE ALSO EVEN GOT THE NOVEL JUST RIGHT IN THERE
GQ1RQefuOao_10 0 WE SHOULD GO BACK TO STORY OUTLINE
GQ1RQefuOao_11 0 THE TEXT EDITOR OPTIONS ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT SO I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU THOSE
GQ1RQefuOao_12 0 OF COURSE YOU NO LONGER HAVE YOUR SCENE NAVIGATOR DOWN HERE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO SCENES
GQ1RQefuOao_13 0 THERE'S JUST PLAIN TEXT AND YOU NO LONGER HAVE YOUR TABS DOWN HERE FOR ALL THOSE OPTIONS BECAUSE IT'S JUST PLAIN TEXT
GQ1RQefuOao_14 0 BUT YOU DO HAVE SOME MORE OPTIONS IN YOUR TOOLBAR
GQ1RQefuOao_15 0 THERE'S A LOT MORE FONTS INCREASING THE FONT SIZE RIGHT HERE FONT COLOR AND SIMILAR TO THE JUST REGULAR STUFF UNDO AND REDO CUT SAY COPY AND PASTE
GQ1RQefuOao_16 0 AND THEN YOU HAVE A FIND AND REPLACE AND A CHECK SPELLING AND ANOTHER ZOOM OPTION
GQ1RQefuOao_17 0 AND THEN YOU HAVE THE STANDARD BOLD ITALIC UNDERLINE AND THEN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAT THE OTHER EDITORS IS THE STRIKETHROUGH
GQ1RQefuOao_18 0 BUT YOU'VE STILL GOT YOUR ALL CAPS AND LOWERCASE
GQ1RQefuOao_19 0 YOU CAN FINALLY JUSTIFY HOWEVER YOU WANT
GQ1RQefuOao_20 0 YOU CAN ALSO MAKE BULLETS OR A NUMBERED LIST AND THEN THERE'S SOME INDENT OPTIONS
GQ1RQefuOao_21 0 SO THIS IS GREAT FOR JUST ANY KIND OF LONG DOCUMENT NOTES ABOUT YOUR PROJECT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE
GQ1RQefuOao_22 0 AND LIKE I SAID IT'S A GOOD PLACE FOR SOMETHING LIKE A STORY OUTLINE OR MAYBE A SYNOPSIS OF THE PLOT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
GQ1RQefuOao_23 0 SO THAT IS THE TEXT EDITOR IN CELTX
GIsAEvpCRRM_1 0 ONE QUESTION I GET ASKED WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KIDS IN CHIROPRACTIC IS
GIsAEvpCRRM_2 0 WHY DOES A CHILD NEED TO GET CHIROPRACTIC CARE
GIsAEvpCRRM_3 0 THEY DON'T HURT OR THEY DON'T HAVE PROBLEMS
GIsAEvpCRRM_4 0 THEY DON'T HAVE LOW BACK PAIN THEY DON'T HAVE NECK PAIN
GIsAEvpCRRM_5 0 SO WHY DOES A CHILD NEED CHIROPRACTIC CARE
GIsAEvpCRRM_6 0 WELL IF WE LOOK BACK TO THE BIRTHING PROCESS
GIsAEvpCRRM_7 0 WE KNOW THAT A BABY COMES FOR BEING IN A WARM ENVIRONMENT FOR NINE MONTHS
GIsAEvpCRRM_8 0 ALL OF A SUDDEN HAS TO GET FORCED THROUGH A LITTLE OPENING THAT IT REALLY DOESN'T FIT THROUGH
GIsAEvpCRRM_9 0 AS THE HEAD STARTS TO COME OUT THE DOCTOR NOW CAN GRAB A HOLD OF THE HEAD
GIsAEvpCRRM_10 0 AND STUDIES HAVE ACTUALLY SHOWN THAT THE DOCTORS PULL WITH ABOUT A FORCE OF ABOUT NINETY POUNDS OF PRESSURE
GIsAEvpCRRM_11 0 NOW THAT'S NOTHING TO FAULT THE DOCTORS
GIsAEvpCRRM_12 0 BUT THAT'S JUST WHAT'S HAPPENING
GIsAEvpCRRM_13 0 THAT'S HOW THEY HELP AND ASSIST THE BIRTHING PROCESS
GIsAEvpCRRM_14 0 NOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I'M NOT SURE I'D WANT MY CHILD'S HEAD TO BE PULLED
GIsAEvpCRRM_15 0 WITH NINETY POUNDS OF PRESSURE WITH A CHILD THAT CANNOT HOLD THEIR HEAD UP YET
GIsAEvpCRRM_16 0 OR CANNOT MOVE AROUND LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO DOWN THE ROAD
GIsAEvpCRRM_17 0 SO ONE WAY THAT THEIR SPINAL COLUMN BECOMES CAN BECOME MISALIGNED IS THROUGH THE BIRTHING PROCESS ITSELF
GIsAEvpCRRM_18 0 JUST GOING THROUGH THE SMALL OPENING
GIsAEvpCRRM_19 0 AND THEN AS A DOCTOR ASSISTS THE BABY AS IT COMES OUT INTO THE WORLD
gCu2IQp9OaA_2 0 THIS IS JON ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gCu2IQp9OaA_3 0 IN THIS VIDEO CLIP I WILL BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO FIND PLANS FOR SAWHORSES
gCu2IQp9OaA_4 0 WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR IS SIMPLE WOODWORKING PLANS
gCu2IQp9OaA_5 0 I LIKE TO TURN TO THE INTERNET AND I WILL TYPE IN SAWHORSE PLANS AND THIS WILL BRING UP DIFFERENT SAWHORSE PLANS WEBSITES
gCu2IQp9OaA_6 0 IF I CLICK ON THE FIRST ONE IT SHOULD BRING UP A PLAN FOR A SAWHORSE HERE AND IF I SCROLL DOWN IT GIVES ME MY LENGTHS AND MY MEASUREMENTS IN ADDITION TO MY DIRECTIONS
gCu2IQp9OaA_7 0 IF I KEEP GOING THROUGH SOME OTHER PLANS I WILL COME ACROSS SOME WEBSITES THAT HAVE THE PLANS BUT YOU HAVE TO EITHER PAY OR BECOME A MEMBER
gCu2IQp9OaA_8 0 I TYPICALLY DON'T LOOK AT THESE UNLESS THERE IS A PLAN THAT I REALLY LIKE
gCu2IQp9OaA_9 0 ONE WEBSITE THAT I RECOMMEND IS ABOUT.COM
gCu2IQp9OaA_10 0 THEY HAVE A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATIONAL RESOURCES AND I CAME ACROSS THIS SET OF ULTIMATE WOOD SAWHORSES
gCu2IQp9OaA_11 0 ONCE YOU FIND THE WEBSITE YOU WILL COME UP WITH THE DESIGNS AND IF YOU SCROLL DOWN IT WILL GIVE YOU A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF IT AS WELL AS ALL THE DIRECTIONS
gCu2IQp9OaA_12 0 NOW OUR COMPLETED SAWHORSES ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE TWO SEPARATE SAWHORSES THAT STACK ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND I THINK THIS IS A REAL UNIQUE DESIGN BECAUSE WHEN USING SAWHORSES YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE TWO AND TO BE ABKLE TO STACK THEM TO BE ABLE TO SAVE SPACE
GC4r5mnCpgc_1 0 HI I'M HARVEY WHITEY OWNER OF PERFECT TAN HERE IN OREM UTAH WE HAVE A FULL SERVICE TANNING CENTER WITH ALL TANNING BEDS AND A SPRAY ON SYSTEM
GC4r5mnCpgc_2 0 I OFTEN GET ASKED YOU KNOW BY EATING CARROTS CAN YOU GET A TAN BY EATING A LOT OF CARROTS
GC4r5mnCpgc_3 0 AND OF COURSE THE ANSWER IS PROBABLY YES
GC4r5mnCpgc_4 0 IF YOU EAT ENOUGH CARROTS IT COULD TURN YOUR SKIN ORANGE IN FACT EVEN YEARS AGO THEY HAD CARROT PILLS THAT THE FDA TOOK THEM OFF OUT OF PRODUCTION
GC4r5mnCpgc_5 0 BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE GOT KIND OF AN ORANGEY TINT TO THEM
GC4r5mnCpgc_6 0 DOES IT HELP YOU WITH YOUR TAN PROBABLY NOT
GC4r5mnCpgc_7 0 YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU'LL HAVE TO EXPERIMENT YOURSELF
GC4r5mnCpgc_8 0 CARROTS ARE GOOD FOR YOU OF COURSE YOU COULD EAT THEM
GC4r5mnCpgc_9 0 BUT I DON'T THINK YOU WANT AN ORANGEY TAN
GC4r5mnCpgc_10 0 THE BEST WAY TO GET A TAN WITHOUT TANNING IN A TANNING BED WOULD BE TO USE A SPRAY ON SYSTEM OR A SELF TANNER BOTTLE THAT YOU COULD BUY ON YOUR OWN AND APPLY YOURSELF
GC4r5mnCpgc_11 0 THE QUICKEST WAY THOUGH IS USING AN INDOOR SPRAY TAN SYSTEM THAT'S FULLY AUTOMATED
GC4r5mnCpgc_12 0 YOU CAN GET A FULL TAN BODY TAN IN LESS THEN A MINUTE AND THAT WILL USUALLY LAST YOU ANYWHERE UP TO A WEEK
GC4r5mnCpgc_13 0 AND SO THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GET A TAN WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT EATING TOO MANY CARROTS
_h8wYNwAT0w_1 0 HI MY NAME IS DAN SCHMIDT FROM THE CHINESE MARTIAL ARTS CENTER AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE SHOWING YOU THE PROPER LEAN AWAY SIDE KICK
_h8wYNwAT0w_2 0 OKAY STARTING FROM THE FIGHTING POSITION OKAY THERE'S TWO WAY TO DO IT
_h8wYNwAT0w_3 0 YOU CAN EITHER TAKE A SMALL STEP BACK OR YOU CAN JUST LEAN AWAY
_h8wYNwAT0w_5 0 AS YOU LEAN AWAY YOU WANT TO TURN VERY SLIGHTLY KEEPING THE HEAD IN A STRAIGHT LINE WITH YOUR FRONT SHOULDER
_h8wYNwAT0w_6 0 YOU WANT TO PICK UP THE FRONT LEG THIS WAY KICK STRAIGHT OUT AND THEN STRAIGHT BACK DOWN
_h8wYNwAT0w_7 0 OKAY WITH THE STEP IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME WAY
_h8wYNwAT0w_8 0 JUST STEP AND TURN A LITTLE PICK UP THE KNEE AND KICK STRAIGHT OUT STRAIGHT IN THEN DOWN
_h8wYNwAT0w_9 0 SO AGAIN YOU STEP UP KICK AND DOWN
_h8wYNwAT0w_10 0 OKAY FROM THIS ANGLE
_h8wYNwAT0w_11 0 SO HE LEANS AWAY OKAY SEE THE SHOULDERS STRAIGHT LINE GOING THIS WAY TO COMPLETE 45 DEGREE ANGLE FROM HIS FRONT FOOT PICKS UP THE LEG KICK STRAIGHT OUT STRAIGHT IN AND DOWN
_h8wYNwAT0w_12 0 OKAY THIS KICK IS GOOD AGAINST SOMEONE THAT'S EITHER MORE POWERFUL OR A LOT BIGGER THAN YOU
_h8wYNwAT0w_13 0 OKAY SO IF SOMEONE COMES WITH PUNCHES TO THE FACE AND THEY'RE MORE POWERFUL OKAY IT'S EASY SO YOU JUST LEAN BACK PICK UP THE FOOT YOU KICK STRAIGHT IN
_h8wYNwAT0w_15 0 OR IF YOU WANT TO USE IT IT'S LIKE A FAKE TACTIC

gCjS8NrpTyM_3 0 SO WHAT I'M GOING TO START OUT FIRST IS HOW TO KIND OF CREATE A NICE RETRO EYE
gCjS8NrpTyM_4 0 ONE THING THAT I THINK JUST MAKES A GREAT DYNAMIC LOOK TO CREATE A RETRO LOOK IS THE FALSE EYELASHES
gCjS8NrpTyM_5 0 NOW THESE YOU CAN FIND PRETTY AFFORDABLE
gCjS8NrpTyM_6 0 I FOUND THESE ON ELF.COM E-L-F DOT COM AND THEY'RE KNOWN TO MAKE ONE DOLLAR MAKEUP

gCjS8NrpTyM_13 0 NOW NEXT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW YOU CAN KIND OF CREATE A NICE BASIC EYE
gCjS8NrpTyM_14 0 NOW I'M NO COSMETOLOGIST HOWEVER I THINK I CAN GIVE YOU A FEW NICE TIPS ON HOW TO CREATE A NICE LOOK FOR YOUR EYE
gCjS8NrpTyM_15 0 TODAY I JUST STARTED OUT WITH A BASIC FOUNDATION ON MY MAKEUP
gCjS8NrpTyM_16 0 I JUST HAVE ON MY FOUNDATION AND SOME MASCARA AND JUST A LITTLE BIT ON MY BROWS
gCjS8NrpTyM_17 0 IF I'M MAY SUGGEST A WHITE OR A PEARLY LIGHT SHADE OF EYE SHADOW START USING THAT ON YOUR BROW JUST TO KIND OF CREATE SOME DEFINITION
gCjS8NrpTyM_18 0 YOU CAN KIND OF BRING IT DOWN
gCjS8NrpTyM_19 0 BUT I THINK IT LOOKS REALLY NICE WHEN YOU JUST KIND OF BLEND IT INTO YOUR BROW ARCH RIGHT HERE TO KIND OF CREATE SOME NICE LIGHT AND DEFINITION
gCjS8NrpTyM_20 0 I'M GOING TO APPLY THIS NEXT TO THE CENTER PART OF MY EYE UP INTO THE BROW THERE
gCjS8NrpTyM_21 0 JUST KIND OF SWEEP IT OFF TO THE SIDE
gCjS8NrpTyM_22 0 YOU KNOW NOT TOO MUCH IT'S KIND OF NICE KIND OF SUBTLE
gCjS8NrpTyM_23 0 IT KIND OF CREATES A NICE FOUNDATION AND BASE
gCjS8NrpTyM_24 0 THE NEXT STEP DEPENDING ON HOW COMFORTABLE YOU ARE WITH WEARING MAKEUP WHETHER YOU WEAR A LOT OR A LITTLE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS IT'S NOT FOR EVERYBODY BUT I LIKE TO CREATE A LITTLE BIT OF A SMOKY OLD HOLLYWOOD KIND OF A FILM STAR LOOK WITH A LITTLE BIT OF A CHARCOAL EYE SHADOW
gCjS8NrpTyM_25 0 THIS ONE HERE I'M USING SOME URBAN DECAY
gCjS8NrpTyM_26 0 THIS ONE IS THEIR OIL SLICK
gCjS8NrpTyM_27 0 IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A METALLIC SMOKY BLACK
gCjS8NrpTyM_28 0 YOU DON'T NEED A LOT
gCjS8NrpTyM_29 0 THE BLACK GOES A LONG WAY
gCjS8NrpTyM_30 0 SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS BRUSH IT RIGHT THROUGH THE CREASE AND BRING IT OUT A LITTLE BIT TO KIND OF CREATE A DRAMATIC LOOK
gCjS8NrpTyM_31 0 SO WE START HERE
gCjS8NrpTyM_32 0 THE CHARCOAL COLORS ARE VERY PIGMENTED
gCjS8NrpTyM_33 0 SO YOU HAVE TO KIND OF HAVE A GOOD MAKEUP HAND AND KIND OF BLEND WITH IT KIND OF WORK WITH IT
gCjS8NrpTyM_34 0 THEN CREATE THAT SMOKY LOOK WITH YOUR BRUSH AND YOUR FINGER
gCjS8NrpTyM_35 0 JUST KIND OF PLAY IT OUT LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN SEE I'M KIND OF BRINGING THE CREASE OUT HERE TO KIND OF JUST A LITTLE YOU DON'T NEED A LOT JUST A LITTLE AND IT CREATES SOME NICE DEPTH FOR YOUR EYES ESPECIALLY FOR SOME EVENING WEAR
gCjS8NrpTyM_36 0 IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THIS AND I'LL APPLY IT TO THE SECOND EYE HERE
gCjS8NrpTyM_37 0 AGAIN A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY
gCjS8NrpTyM_38 0 DON'T BE AFRAID TO USE YOUR FINGER TO KIND OF BLEND IT IN THERE
gCjS8NrpTyM_39 0 BRING IT OUT TO YOUR EYE
gCjS8NrpTyM_40 0 KIND OF CREATE SOME NICE DEPTH
gCjS8NrpTyM_41 0 MAKE YOUR EYES LOOK GOOD
gCjS8NrpTyM_42 0 I'M DOING THIS REAL FAST SO HOPEFULLY IT LOOKS ALRIGHT
Gz_i5gyj6Ck_1 0 IN THE THIRD INSTALLMENT OF THE ALLEY-OOP DUNKS WE HAVE THE DUNK FROM THE TOP OF THE KEY OR THE ALLEY-OOP DUNK FROM THE TOP OF THE KEY I'M SORRY
Gz_i5gyj6Ck_2 0 AND THAT INVOLVES A GUARD GENERALLY DRIBBLING AROUND THE TOP OF THE KEY AREA
Gz_i5gyj6Ck_3 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO PASS IT TO THE RIM TO ANOTHER PLAYER STREAKING TOWARDS THE BASKET
Gz_i5gyj6Ck_4 0 IT'S GOING TO BE A HIGH LOFTING PASS TOWARDS THE EDGE OF THE RIM
Gz_i5gyj6Ck_5 0 AND THERE'S GENERALLY A LOOK OR SOME KIND OF SIGNAL THAT TWO PLAYERS USE IN ORDER TO KNOW WHEN THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
Gz_i5gyj6Ck_6 0 SO YOU CAN OFTEN TIMES SET IT UP AS A SHOT THAT'S MISSED OR JUST A LOB
Gz_i5gyj6Ck_7 0 AND BUT YOU WANT TO LOB IT UP AND GIVE THE PLAYER ENOUGH TIME TO CATCH THE BALL AND DELIVER INTO THE BASKET WITH VORACITY
Gz_i5gyj6Ck_8 0 ONE VARIATION ON THE ALLEY-OOP IS THAT NOT ALL ALLEY-OOPS HAVE TO BE DUNKS
Gz_i5gyj6Ck_9 0 THEY CAN BE EASY LAY INS SO BUT YOU USE TO DEMONSTRATE YOU USE AND DEMONSTRATE THE EXACT SAME PRINCIPALS OF THE ALLEY-OOP DUNK IN AN ALLEY-OOP LAYUP
Gz_i5gyj6Ck_10 0 THIS IS OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS IN BASKETBALL TO EXECUTE HAVING TO DO WITH THE TIMING AND THE POSITION OF THE BASKETBALL WITH THE TWO PLAYERS
Gz_i5gyj6Ck_11 0 AND THAT'S HOW YOU DEMONSTRATE THE TOP OF THE KEY PASS ENTRY PASS FOR THE ALLEY-OOP
g9oJ4jVZcL8_1 0 THEN I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A PICTURE FRAME
g9oJ4jVZcL8_2 0 ITS A GREAT PROJECT BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT USES
g9oJ4jVZcL8_3 0 IT COULD JUST BE A GREAT ARTS AND CRAFTS PROJECT FOR ANYBODY OR IT COULD MADE AS A GIFT FOR A FAMILY MEMBER FOR A GRANDPARENT TO PUT A PICTURE OF A CHILD INSIDE
g9oJ4jVZcL8_4 0 AND I'VE DONE THIS PROJECT A LOT WITH KIDS BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY OR FATHER'S DAY AND THEY ALSO LIKE TO GIVE IT TO THEIR PARENTS AS A GIFT
g9oJ4jVZcL8_5 0 SO THERE'S A LOT OF USES FOR THIS PROJECT
g9oJ4jVZcL8_6 0 ITS A LOT OF FUN AND LET ME SHOW YOU THE SUPPLIES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO MAKE A PICTURE FRAME
g9oJ4jVZcL8_7 0 WE'RE GOING TO NEED A SHEET OF PLASTIC
g9oJ4jVZcL8_8 0 IT S A VERY CLEAR PIECE OF PLASTIC AND THIS IS GOING TO GO OVER THE PICTURE TO PROTECT IT
g9oJ4jVZcL8_9 0 WE'RE GOING TO BE MAKING OUR FRAME FROM TWO PIECES OF CARDBOARD AND THE REASON WHY WE NEED TWO PIECES IS ONE IS GOING TO BE THE ACTUAL FRAME
g9oJ4jVZcL8_10 0 WE'RE GOING TO CUT AROUND IT AND MAKE A SHAPE AND THE SECOND PIECE IS GOING TO BE THE BACKING
g9oJ4jVZcL8_11 0 WE'RE ALSO GOING TO NEED A RULER AND A SCISSORS
g9oJ4jVZcL8_12 0 I'M ALSO GOING TO BE USING A PENCIL AND SOME PAINTBRUSHES AND I HAVE A FEW MARKERS ON HAND TO HELP ME WITH THE DECORATIONS
g9oJ4jVZcL8_13 0 I'M GOING TO NEED AND EXACTO KNIFE AND THAT'S GOING TO HELP ME MAKE SOME HOLES INTO THE CARDBOARD AND ALSO TO HELP ME CUT IT
g9oJ4jVZcL8_14 0 AND I'LL NEED SOME MASKING TAPE
g9oJ4jVZcL8_15 0 I'LL NEED SOME PAINT AND GLUE
g9oJ4jVZcL8_16 0 I'M GOING TO BE USING SOME STRING TO PUT ON THE BACK OF THE PICTURE FRAME TO HANG IT
g9oJ4jVZcL8_17 0 I'M GOING TO NEED SOME WHITE THICK BASE PAINT
g9oJ4jVZcL8_18 0 THIS IS A TYPE OF PAINT THAT GOES OVER AND PUTS A LATER ON TOP OF THE PICTURE FRAME
g9oJ4jVZcL8_19 0 THE REASON THAT I NEED IT IS BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE PUTTING SOME GOLD METAL FASTENERS INTO THE CARDBOARD TO HELP ME FASTEN THE BACK OF THE PICTURE FRAME AND THEN I'M GOING TO COVER IT WITH MASKING TAPE
g9oJ4jVZcL8_20 0 I'M GOING TO COVER THE FASTENERS WITH MASKING TAPE AND I DON'T WANT THEM TO SHOW THROUGH WHEN DECORATING THE PICTURE FRAME
g9oJ4jVZcL8_21 0 SO I'M GOING TO APPLY THIS BASE PAINT OVER IT OVER THE MASKING TAPE AND THAT WILL HELP ME PLACE A NICE EVEN COAT OF COLORED PAINT ALONG THE PICTURE FRAME
g9oJ4jVZcL8_22 0 I'M GOING TO BE USING A LOT OF BEADS FOR MY DECORATIONS OF THE PICTURE FRAME
g9oJ4jVZcL8_23 0 I HAVE SEEN THIS PROJECT DONE WITH EITHER SMALL STONES DIFFERENT COLORED STONES OR TILES OR EVEN SEASHELLS CAN MAKE A REALLY NICE DECORATION FOR THIS PICTURE FRAME
g9oJ4jVZcL8_24 0 BUT I'LL BE USING BEADS TODAY
g9oJ4jVZcL8_25 0 SO NOW WE SEE THE SUPPLIES THAT WE NEED FOR OUR PICTURE FRAME
gAtzv8eaLKs_1 0 ALRIGHT THE DRINK WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE IS THE CATALINA MARGARITA
gAtzv8eaLKs_2 0 START OFF WITH SOME ICE HERE AND OF COURSE ONE SHOT OF TEQUILA STAPLE INGREDIENT TO ANY MARGARITA FOLLOW THAT UP WITH A 1/2 A SHOT OF PEACH SCHNAPPS THERE WE GO AND ALSO A 1/2 SHOT OF BLUE CAROUSEL IT'S GOING TO GIVE US A NICE BLUE PRETTY COLOR
gAtzv8eaLKs_3 0 AND LAST WE'LL DO ABOUT FOUR OUNCES OF SOUR MIX THERE WE GO
gAtzv8eaLKs_4 0 AND WE'LL JUST MIX THIS BACK AND FORTH GET IT ALL BLENDED TOGETHER FOR A CATALINA MARGARITA
gAtzv8eaLKs_5 0 THIS SHOULD HAVE A NICE LITTLE PEACH- THE PEACH AND BLUE CAROUSEL SHOULD KIND OF TONE DOWN THE SWEETNESS OF THE DRINK AND ACTUALLY MAKE IT REALLY GOOD
gAtzv8eaLKs_6 0 FEEL FREE TO RIM YOUR GLASS WITH SUGAR IF YOU'D LIKE AND LETS POUR THIS IN THERE WE GO AND GIVE IT A STRAW AND THERE YOU GO BOTTOMS UP
H6dfERIIgRY_1 0 PARIVRTTA PARSVAKONASANA REVOLVED SIDE ANGLE
H6dfERIIgRY_2 0 I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY VIEWED THIS POSE IN THE FIRST SERIES
H6dfERIIgRY_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN OURSELVES THIS TODAY WE'RE GOING TO USE A CHAIR FOR THIS POSE
H6dfERIIgRY_4 0 SHE'S GOING TO BE SUPPORTED COMPLETELY COMPLETELY WITH THE CHAIR SO THAT SHE CAN STAY IN THIS POSE FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME
H6dfERIIgRY_5 0 SHE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO CREATE LENGTH IN HER SPINE AND THEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE CHAIR AS SHE INHALES TO LENGTHEN AND SHE'S GOING TO TWIST TOWARDS THE BACK OF HER CHAIR SHE'S GOING TO GET THE SUPPORT OF THE CHAIR TO ENCOURAGE THAT TWIST
H6dfERIIgRY_6 0 LOOK AT THE LENGTH IN HER SPINE
H6dfERIIgRY_7 0 SHE'S STILL REVOLVING FROM BELOW THE SHOULDER BLADE SO THAT AS SHE PRESENTS THIS POSE ON THE FLOOR HERE'S YOUR POSE SHE'S STILL TWISTING FROM BELOW THE SHOULDER BLADE
H6dfERIIgRY_8 0 BUT ALL THE WORK IN THE LEGS IS BEING SUPPORTED BY THE CHAIR SO SHE CAN RE-LENGTHEN THE SPINE
H6dfERIIgRY_9 0 THE LONGER THAT SHE MAINTAINS THE POSE SHE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEEPEN THAT TWIST AS THE MUSCLES BEGIN TO SETTLE IN AND RELAX AND THEN PRESENT THE POSE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
H6SUFXtByFk_1 0 SO FIRST WE'RE GOING TO ATTACH OUR LOW E STRING
H6SUFXtByFk_2 0 OUR LOW E STRING IS THE THICKEST STRING ON THE GUITAR
H6SUFXtByFk_3 0 THIS ONE'S A PRETTY THICK ONE FOR AN ELECTRIC GUITAR
H6SUFXtByFk_4 0 AND WE'RE GOING TO JUST STRING IT THROUGH HERE THROUGH THE STRING HOLDER AT THE TOP
H6SUFXtByFk_5 0 THERE'S SOME HOLES HERE
H6SUFXtByFk_6 0 WE CAN GET A CLOSE LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO EXACTLY
H6SUFXtByFk_7 0 WE'RE GOING TO THREAD IT THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE BACK IT'S GOING TO COME OUT THE FRONT AND WE'RE GOING TO PULL IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH
H6SUFXtByFk_8 0 WE'RE GOING TO PLACE IT DOWN ON TOP OF THE BRIDGE AS SO FIT IT INTO PLACE THROUGH THE BRIDGE AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT IN TO OUR HOLE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE FRET BOARD CLOSEST TO THE INSERTION ON THE BRIDGE
H6SUFXtByFk_9 0 THEN WE'RE GOING TO TWIST IT SO THE TUNER IS MOVING COUNTERCLOCKWISE BECAUSE WE NEED THE STRING TO BE ON THE INSIDE OF THE TUNER
H6SUFXtByFk_10 0 WE WANT IT TO BE ON THE INSIDE OF THE NECK HERE SO THAT'S HOW WE HAVE TO DO IT
H6SUFXtByFk_11 0 NOW WE NEED TO GET THE RIGHT TUNER ON OUR STRING SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO IS WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER TO THE PIANO HERE WE'RE GOING TO PLAY A LOW E I'M GOING TO PUT THE VOLUME PEDAL ON SO WE CAN ALL GIVE IT A GOOD LISTEN
H6SUFXtByFk_12 0 WE HEAR THAT TUNE
H6SUFXtByFk_13 0 WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR STRING GET TO THAT SAME PITCH
H6SUFXtByFk_14 0 WE GOT IT
GfDpVYpQdDk_1 0 SOMEONE IS HARASSING YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND YOU ARE CONCERNED THAT IT'S ESCALATING
GfDpVYpQdDk_2 0 WHAT DO YOU DO
GfDpVYpQdDk_3 0 DO YOU GET A RESTRAINING ORDER
GfDpVYpQdDk_4 0 HELLO I'M ROBERT TODD AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION HOW DO I GET A RESTRAINING ORDER
GfDpVYpQdDk_5 0 WELL THE FIRST THING IN CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS NATURE IS CALL THE POLICE IF YOU FEEL THAT EITHER YOU OR YOUR FAMILY'S SAFETY IS IN JEOPARDY
GfDpVYpQdDk_6 0 YOU CAN WORRY ABOUT THE PAPERWORK LATER
GfDpVYpQdDk_7 0 BUT IF AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE POINT THAT YOU ACTUALLY NEED A RESTRAINING ORDER MANY MANY TIMES INDIVIDUALS IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT CAN ASSIST YOU OR DIRECT YOU TO WHERE YOU NEED TO GO TO FILE FOR A RESTRAINING ORDER
GfDpVYpQdDk_8 0 AND IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN YOU CAN GO TO YOUR LOCAL COURT'S OFFICE AND ASK THE CLERK FOR THE PAPERWORK AND THEY WILL ASSIST YOU IN COMPLETING IT
GfDpVYpQdDk_9 0 NOW IT VARIES FROM STATE TO STATE BUT GENERALLY IN MOST STATES THERE'S NOT EVEN A FILING FEE FOR FILING A RESTRAINING ORDER
GfDpVYpQdDk_10 0 BUT REMEMBER YOU AND YOUR FAMILY'S PERSONAL SAFETY COMES FIRST SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES ARE NOTIFIED OF THIS HARASSING SITUATION AND WORRY ABOUT THE PAPERWORK LATER
GfDpVYpQdDk_11 0 I'M ROBERT TODD AND THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
gOTKzd6Fwl0_1 0 THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF AN A MINOR PENTATONIC LICK
gOTKzd6Fwl0_2 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO SHOW IS ON THE B AND THE E STRINGS
gOTKzd6Fwl0_3 0 ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT'S GOING TO SOUND LIKE IS THIS DEMO
gOTKzd6Fwl0_4 0 WHAT I'M DOING HERE IS SIMPLY BENDING UP ON THE HIGH E STRING ON THE 10TH FRET AND USING ABOUT A HALF BEND NOT A FULL THAT WOULD BE A FULL BEND
gOTKzd6Fwl0_5 0 A HALF BEND IS LIKE DEMO
gOTKzd6Fwl0_6 0 THAT NOTE THERE WHICH GIVES A NICE LITTLE OFF TONALITY
gOTKzd6Fwl0_7 0 WHAT I'M DOING IS GOING DEMO AND ENDING ON THE A NOTE ON THE B STRING TENTH FRET AND GIVING IT A NICE LITTLE ROCK
gOTKzd6Fwl0_8 0 I CAN DO THAT WITH MY THIRD FINGER JUST LIKE DOING THIS BUT INSTEAD I'M GOING TO BE DOING IT WITH MY RING FINGER OR THIRD FINGER
gOTKzd6Fwl0_9 0 ESSENTIALLY WHAT I'M DOING HERE IS DEMO AND I'M DIGGING INTO THE STRING WITH MY PICK AS WELL TO GIVE IT A NICE EFFECT
gOTKzd6Fwl0_10 0 SO UP TO SPEED IT WOULD SOUND LIKE THIS DEMO
gfLM3tHE2Ag_1 0 THIS IS THE RELAXATION THERAPY FOR THE LOWER AND INNER THIGH MUSCLES
gfLM3tHE2Ag_2 0 AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE LEG FLAT ON THE TABLE

ggYiexBx6OY_2 0 I'M KAREN FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
ggYiexBx6OY_3 0 NOW I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE THIS CUTE DANCING GIRLS SPINNING PAPER TOP
ggYiexBx6OY_4 0 IT'S REALLY CUTE
ggYiexBx6OY_5 0 IT LOOKS LIKE A BUNCH OF GIRLS IN A CIRCLE SINGING HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU
ggYiexBx6OY_6 0 SO WHAT YOU'LL NEED FOR THIS IS A SIX INCH SQUARE OF PAPER AND THEN ANOTHER SMALLER PIECE
ggYiexBx6OY_7 0 MAYBE A TWO INCH SQUARE TO MAKE THE LITTLE CAKE IN THE MIDDLE
ggYiexBx6OY_8 0 AND THIS IS ALMOST LIKE MAKING A SNOWFLAKE
ggYiexBx6OY_9 0 WE'RE GOING TO DO A SIX FOLDED SNOWFLAKE
ggYiexBx6OY_10 0 SO START BY FOLDING YOUR PAPER IN HALF AND CREASING IT DOWN THE CENTER
ggYiexBx6OY_11 0 AND THEN YOU WANT TO FOLD IT IN THIRDS
ggYiexBx6OY_12 0 WHICH IS A LITTLE TRICKY TO GET THEM EVEN
ggYiexBx6OY_13 0 AND I'M GOING TO FOLD ONE SECTION IN THE FRONT AND ONE IN THE BACK
ggYiexBx6OY_14 0 SO IT'S A REGULAR SNOWFLAKE FOLD
ggYiexBx6OY_15 0 AND YOU FOLD IT LIKE THAT
ggYiexBx6OY_16 0 THEN YOU'RE GOING TO TRIM THE BOTTOM IN A CIRCLE LIKE THAT A LITTLE BIT OF A CURVE
ggYiexBx6OY_17 0 AND JUST CHECK TO MAKE SURE IT'S EVEN SO THAT WHEN YOU OPEN IT UP YOU HAVE A LITTLE CIRCLE AND THAT'S THE THREE FOLDS LIKE THAT
ggYiexBx6OY_18 0 KIND OF IN A ZIG ZAG
ggYiexBx6OY_20 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO CUT SOME LITTLE GIRLS
ggYiexBx6OY_21 0 SO YOU NEED TO YOU'RE GOING TO DO A HALF OF A LITTLE GIRL
ggYiexBx6OY_22 0 YOU CAN EITHER TRACE IT OUT OR YOU CAN JUST CUT IT LIKE THIS
ggYiexBx6OY_23 0 MAKE THE HEAD AND THEN THE STRAIGHT LINE FOR THE ARM AND COME BACK TO THE EDGE AND THEN MAKE A LITTLE CURVE FOR A SKIRT AND COME BACK DOWN
ggYiexBx6OY_24 0 AND RIGHT HERE YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE A LITTLE STRAIGHT CUT LIKE THAT
ggYiexBx6OY_25 0 SO THAT'S WHAT THE CUT LOOKS LIKE
ggYiexBx6OY_26 0 THEN YOU'RE GOING TO REPEAT THAT ON THE OTHER SIDE LIKE SO

ggYiexBx6OY_36 0 IT HAS TO BE A LITTLE BIT POINTED IN THE MIDDLE
gkYaBjdyHCs_1 0 NOW I WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DECORATE THE BIG BEAD WITH SOME SPECIAL COLORS
gkYaBjdyHCs_2 0 I'M GOING TO BE USING A GOLD METALLIC MARKER
gkYaBjdyHCs_3 0 THE REASON WHY WE WANT TO DECORATE THIS SO THAT IT STANDS OUT A LITTLE MORE IS BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE THE LOWEST HANGING BEAD ON THE STRING AND IT'S GOING TO BE THE MOST VISIBLE BEAD
gkYaBjdyHCs_4 0 SO BEING THAT IT'S BIGGER AND THAT IT'S HANGING LOWER PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT IT IT WILL CATCH THE EYE FIRST
gkYaBjdyHCs_5 0 WE WANT TO MAKE IT STAND OUT A LITTLE MORE AND MAKE IT LOOK A LITTLE MORE SPECIAL
gkYaBjdyHCs_6 0 THAT IS WHY I CHOSE TO USE THE METALLIC PAINT
gkYaBjdyHCs_7 0 IT'S A LITTLE BIT BRIGHTER AND THIS CAN BE DONE AFTER THE BEAD HAS BEEN TIED TO THE STRING
gkYaBjdyHCs_8 0 THERE IS REALLY NO PROBLEM OF GETTING THE HANDS DIRTY AND THEN ONCE THIS IS DONE WE CAN GO AHEAD AND ADD THE OTHER BEADS TO THE STRING AND COMPLETE THE STRING OF BEADS FOR THE INSIDE OF THE BELL
gax9bzjY14k_2 0 I'M MARCHELLE WITH ELEMENTS UNIVERSITY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gax9bzjY14k_3 0 SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT INCLUDE THE FIVE STEP CONSULTATION
gax9bzjY14k_4 0 WE TALKED ABOUT GREETING ASKING ANALYZING
gax9bzjY14k_5 0 BASICALLY ASSESSING THE NEEDS OF YOUR CLIENT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THEM THE BEST SERVICE POSSIBLE
gax9bzjY14k_6 0 WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE CLIENT TICKET
gax9bzjY14k_7 0 FILLING OUT THAT INFORMATION IS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP GOOD RECORDS OF WHAT WAS DONE TO YOUR CLIENT SO YOU CAN HELP THEM OUT WHEN THEY COME BACK IN FOR THE COLOR OR WHATEVER IT WAS THAT YOU DID
gax9bzjY14k_8 0 WE ALSO TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT GIFT CERTIFICATES
gax9bzjY14k_9 0 WE TALKED ABOUT SHOWING THEM THE PRODUCTS THAT WERE USED ON THEM
gax9bzjY14k_10 0 IF YOU TAKE EVERYTHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY AND UTILIZE THAT YOU WILL BE AMAZED AT THE RESULTS
gax9bzjY14k_11 0 EVERYTHING COMBINED MAKES UP OUR CES SYSTEM
gax9bzjY14k_12 0 THAT'S THE CLIENT EXPERIENCE SYSTEM AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT HERE AT ELEMENTS UNIVERSITY THAT ALL STUDENTS KNOW HOW TO DO IT AND DO IT WELL
gax9bzjY14k_13 0 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND CHECKING OUT ALL THE OTHER VIDEOS IN THIS CATEGORY
hbXO3sxEvFQ_1 0 CLANCY ROSE ALRIGHT SO THE NEXT THING WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS THE HOME ESPRESSO MACHINE
hbXO3sxEvFQ_2 0 AND OF COURSE WITH THAT WE HAVE YOUR PORTER FILTER AGAIN THIS IS THE GROUP HEAD
hbXO3sxEvFQ_3 0 YOU HAVE THE STEAM WAND OVER HERE
hbXO3sxEvFQ_4 0 THE FIRST THING THAT YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS TO PLUG IT IN AND TURN IT ON
hbXO3sxEvFQ_5 0 AND AFTER YOU TURN IT ON YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL ALL THE PARTS OF THE ESPRESSO MACHINE AND THE WATER IN THE WATER TANK IS HEATED UP TO THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE
hbXO3sxEvFQ_6 0 AND YOU CAN HEAT UP LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE PORTER FILTER A LITTLE BIT FASTER BY FLOWING A LITTLE BIT OF WATER THROUGH THE PORTER FILTER AND THAT WILL GET IT UP TO THE SAME TEMPERATURE AS THE GROUP HEAD
hbXO3sxEvFQ_7 0 YOU CAN ALSO FLUSH WATER THROUGH THE STEAM WAND AND HEAT THAT UP WRAP A TOWEL AROUND IT SO YOU DO NOT BURN YOURSELF ON THAT STEAM WHEN IT COMES OUT
hbXO3sxEvFQ_8 0 THE WATER TEMPERATURE IS ANOTHER SUPER IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT GOES INTO BREWING ESPRESSO
hbXO3sxEvFQ_9 0 THE TEMPERATURE THAT YOU THAT IS PREFERABLE TO KEEP YOUR WATER AT IS TO RIGHT AT 200 DEGREES
hbXO3sxEvFQ_10 0 THE WAY THAT I WILL TEST THAT RIGHT NOW IS BY TURNING ON THE GROUP HEAD AND LET WATER FLOW THROUGH HERE I WILL TAKE MY THERMOMETER
hbXO3sxEvFQ_11 0 SO YOU ARE GOING TO WANT A THERMOMETER THAT GOES UP TO 200 OR AT LEAST LIKE 220 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT OR SO
hbXO3sxEvFQ_12 0 AFTER I TURN IT ON THE WATER WILL START COMING OUT AND I WILL STICK IT IN THIS HOLE RIGHT HERE AND WHATEVER TEMPERATURE IT STARTS TO STABILIZE AT IS WHERE THE WATER IN THE MACHINE IS GOING TO BE AND I WANT THAT AT ABOUT 200 DEGREES
hbXO3sxEvFQ_13 0 ALRIGHT SO THIS MACHINE DOES HEAT UP THE WATER TO RIGHT ABOUT 200 DEGREES AND IT IS STABILIZING RIGHT THERE SO THAT IS GOOD AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE I WANT IT
hbXO3sxEvFQ_14 0 FOR YOUR INDIVIDUAL HOME MACHINE YOU HAVE TO REFER TO YOUR HOME TO YOUR OWNER'S MANUAL TO SEE HOW TO ADJUST THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER IN THE MACHINE OR ALSO TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THAT TEMPERATURE STAYING STABLE
Gq5mCJmXdco_1 0 HERE I WILL BE DISCUSSING THE DUMBEK
Gq5mCJmXdco_2 0 NOW THIS INSTRUMENT HAS MANY DIFFERENT NAMES LIKE DARBUKA BEING ANOTHER ONE OF THEM
Gq5mCJmXdco_3 0 BUT ESSENTIALLY THE CONSTRUCTION IS THE SAME
Gq5mCJmXdco_4 0 IT IS A MIDDLE EASTERN DRUM VERY COMMON IN ETHIOPIA IN EGYPT
Gq5mCJmXdco_5 0 BUT THE UPPER EDGE CHANGES SO IN SOME OF LIKE EASTERN EUROPE COUNTRIES OR IN TURKEY FOR EXAMPLE THE RIM WILL BE METAL
Gq5mCJmXdco_6 0 RATHER THAN THE EGYPTIAN VERSION OF THIS WHICH WILL HAVE A CURVED EDGE
Gq5mCJmXdco_7 0 CREATING A DIFFERENT SOUND AS YOU APPROACH THE EDGE OF THE SKIN OF THE INSTRUMENT
Gq5mCJmXdco_8 0 THE SKIN IS WHAT CALLED TIGHT ACROSS HERE
Gq5mCJmXdco_9 0 OFTEN MADE WITH ANIMAL SKIN ESPECIALLY BEFORE THEY HAD SYNTHETIC SKINS HERE
Gq5mCJmXdco_10 0 THIS CASE IS METAL
Gq5mCJmXdco_11 0 SOMETIMES IT WILL BE CERAMIC OR CLAY EVEN
Gq5mCJmXdco_12 0 NOW THE BOTTOM IS HOLLOW AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS NOT ONLY LET THE SOUND COME OUT OF THE INSTRUMENT BUT AS YOU STRIKE THE INSTRUMENT IF YOU INSERT YOUR HAND INTO THE BOTTOM YOU CHANGE THE TONE OF THE DRUM
Gq5mCJmXdco_13 0 [PLAY DRUM] YOU NOTICE THAT IT GETS LOWER WHEN I BRING THE HAND IN THERE CHANGING THE FREQUENCY OF THE SOUND COMING OUT
Gq5mCJmXdco_14 0 NOW THE NAME DUMBEK ESSENTIALLY COMES FROM THE TWO SOUNDS THAT YOU CAN GET FROM THE INSTRUMENT
Gq5mCJmXdco_15 0 'DUM WHICH IS WHEN YOU HIT IN THE CENTER OF THE INSTRUMENT HERE KIND OF A LOW SOUND
Gq5mCJmXdco_16 0 AND TEK OR BEK IN THIS CASE WHEN YOU ARE HITTING THE EDGE OF THE RIM EDGE OF THE SKIN YOU ARE GETTING THAT VERY CRISP SOUND
GaHNvEqJyF4_1 0 WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A SAFE DRIVING DISTANCE BETWEEN OTHER AUTOMOBILES AND IN INCLEMENT WEATHER YOU WANT TO STAY AT LEAST TWO VEHICLES OR VEHICLE AND HALF BEHIND THE OTHER CAR AHEAD OF YOU
GaHNvEqJyF4_2 0 IN THE EVENT THAT HE DOES SOMETHING IRRATIONAL YOU WILL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO STOP

gzXKGlJfYYc_2 0 AN OLLIE IN SNOWBOARDING IS PRETTY MUCH JUST HAVING BOARD CONTROL
gzXKGlJfYYc_3 0 AFTER YOU'VE TAKEN A FEW RUNS DOWN THE MOUNTAIN TAKEN SOME CARVES AND YOU KNOW YOUR EDGES
gzXKGlJfYYc_4 0 YOU'RE GETTING THE FEEL FOR YOUR SNOWBOARD
gzXKGlJfYYc_5 0 YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO WANT TO POP
gzXKGlJfYYc_6 0 YOU WANT TO GET UP OFF THOSE LITTLE BUMPS AND GET OVER THINGS AND JUMP ON THE BOXES AND STUFF
gzXKGlJfYYc_7 0 THAT FIRST STEP OF TAKING THOSE TO THE NEXT LEVEL IS AN OLLIE
gzXKGlJfYYc_8 0 AN OLLIE IS PRETTY MUCH WHERE YOUR WEIGHT IS JUST ON YOUR BACK FOOT
gzXKGlJfYYc_9 0 YOU CAN START OFF ON FLAT GROUND
gzXKGlJfYYc_10 0 JUST LIKE THIS
gzXKGlJfYYc_11 0 YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR BACK FOOT HOP AND THAT'S IT
gzXKGlJfYYc_12 0 IT'S LIKE SWHSSSS
gzXKGlJfYYc_13 0 YOU COULD DO THIS ON FLAT GROUND HUNDREDS OF TIMES
gzXKGlJfYYc_14 0 IT JUST GETS YOU BETTER AND BETTER AT YOUR BOARD CONTROL
gzXKGlJfYYc_15 0 NEXT STEP YOU WANT TO TAKE IT UP THE MOUNTAIN AND TRY IT GOING DOWN A LITTLE SLOPE
gzXKGlJfYYc_16 0 ONCE YOU'RE ON THE SLOPE YOU'RE GOING DOWNHILL ALREADY SO IT'S EASY TO POP ONTO YOUR TAIL AND JUST LIFT THAT FRONT FOOT UP AND GET IT A LITTLE FLAT BASED
gzXKGlJfYYc_17 0 BACK DOWN TO THE GROUND

gsVqK3PaMRk_1 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M CAROLINE AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT WITCHCRAFT
gsVqK3PaMRk_2 0 ANOTHER WITCH OF OUR TIME WHO EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT OR HAS HEARD ABOUT IN EITHER A GOOD WAY OR A BAD WAY IS LORIE CABOT
gsVqK3PaMRk_3 0 SHE IS OUT OF SALEM MASSACHUSETTS
gsVqK3PaMRk_4 0 SHE IS A PROPRIETOR OF HER OWN STORE IT'S CALLED THE CAT THE CROW AND THE CROWN
gsVqK3PaMRk_5 0 AND THAT I BELIEVE IS ON PICKERING WHARF IN SALEM
gsVqK3PaMRk_6 0 SHE'S AN EXTREMELY VISIBLE WOMAN SHE IS AN APPROACHABLE WOMAN
gsVqK3PaMRk_7 0 SHE'S A KNOWLEDGABLE WOMAN SHE HAS BEEN DOING WITCHCRAFT FOR SHE'S PROBABLY IN HER SEVENTIES NOW SO SHE'S BEEN DOING IT FOR A GOOD FIFTY OR MORE YEARS
gsVqK3PaMRk_8 0 AND EVERY OCTOBER THEY CELEBRATE THE WHOLE MONTH OF OCTOBER IN SALEM REMEMBERING THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PASSED AND CELEBRATING SAMHAIN WHICH IS OUR NEW YEAR
gsVqK3PaMRk_9 0 OR ALSO KNOWN AS SAM HAIN OR HALLOWEEN
gsVqK3PaMRk_10 0 LORIE IS HIGH PRIESTESS OF HER OWN TRADITION
gsVqK3PaMRk_11 0 AND WE'LL BE GETTING A LITTLE MORE INTO TRADITIONS LATER
HbVG129GEag_1 0 NOW I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT TO DO IF YOU'RE IN A PINCH AND YOU NEED TO SUBSTITUTE ONE ALCOHOL FOR ANOTHER
HbVG129GEag_2 0 SAY YOU'RE WORKING IN A BAR AND YOU RUN OUT OF VODKA AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT OF VODKA THAT NIGHT
HbVG129GEag_3 0 IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO GET IT AND YOU KNOW YOU REALLY NEED IT TO MAKE THE DRINKS ONE THING ONE ALCOHOL YOU CAN SUBSTITUTE WOULD BEGIN
HbVG129GEag_4 0 IT'S NOT EXACTLY THE SAME BUT IT DOES HAVE SIMILAR TENDENCIES AND A LOT OF THE DRINKS THAT YOU MAKE WITH VODKA YOU CAN ALSO MAKE WITH GIN AND VICE VERSA
HbVG129GEag_5 0 SOME DRINKS YOU PROBABLY WOULD WANT TO JUST AVOID MAKING THOUGH IS IF YOU IF SOMEONE ASKS FOR A GIN MARTINI YOU MIGHT JUST WANT TO LET THEM KNOW WE DON'T HAVE GIN BUT I CAN MAKE YOU A VODKA MARTINI ONLY BECAUSE THEY'LL NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE IN A DRINK LIKE THAT
HbVG129GEag_6 0 BUT IF IT'S A MIXED DRINK MOST LIKELY THESE TWO ARE PRETTY EXCHANGEABLE
HbVG129GEag_7 0 IT WON'T TASTE EXACTLY ALIKE BUT IT'LL BE ENOUGH THE DRINK WILL STILL TASTE GOOD
HbVG129GEag_8 0 THE NEXT TWO WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS TEQUILA AND RUM
HbVG129GEag_9 0 THESE TWO ARE THE SAME THING
HbVG129GEag_10 0 IF YOU RUN OUT OF EITHER TEQUILA OR RUM IN MAJORITY OF DRINKS YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SUBSTITUTE ONE FOR THE OTHER
HbVG129GEag_11 0 THESE BOTH BOTH OF THESE ARE TEND TO BE USED IN MORE OF TROPICAL DRINKS OR CARIBBEAN TYPE DRINKS AND AGAIN IF IT'S MIXED WITH A SEVERAL OTHER INGREDIENTS YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO NOTICE THE TASTE THAT MUCH
HbVG129GEag_12 0 IT MIGHT TASTE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT MORE THAN NOT IT'LL TASTE OKAY
HbVG129GEag_13 0 THE NEXT TWO I HAVE MENTIONED IT BEFORE BUT I'M JUST GOING TO SAY IT AGAIN IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCES AND THAT YOU CAN USE THINGS LIKE TRIPLE SEC AND BLUE CURACAO THEY'RE THE SAME
HbVG129GEag_14 0 ALSO COINTREAU IS THE SAME AND GRAND MARNIER
HbVG129GEag_15 0 THE OTHER TWO ARE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER SCALE AND THESE ARE A LITTLE BIT LOWER SCALE BUT YOU CAN SO THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT CHEAPER SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HURT YOUR WALLET TOO MUCH YOU CAN ALWAYS GET SOME OF THESE
HbVG129GEag_16 0 AGAIN RAZZMATAZZ SLOE GIN AND CHAMBORD YOU CAN ALL EXCHANGE FOR EACH OTHER IF YOU NEED TO IN A PINCH
HbVG129GEag_17 0 AND NOW I JUST WANTED TO MENTION REAL QUICK THESE ARE TWO THINGS YOU REALLY NEVER CAN EXCHANGE AND SOME PEOPLE TEND TO THINK YOU CAN
HbVG129GEag_18 0 TONIC WATER AND CLUB SODA TASTE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT SO YOU JUST WANT TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO DO THAT
HbVG129GEag_19 0 TONIC WATER DOESN'T HAVE ANY CALORIES
HbVG129GEag_20 0 SODA WATER ON THE OTHER HAND HAS SALT IN IT SO IT TASTES A LITTLE BIT SALTY AND IT DOES HAVE CALORIES
HbVG129GEag_21 0 AND THE LAST THING YOU DON'T WANT TO EXCHANGE IS SCOTCH WITH ANY OTHER WHISKEY
HbVG129GEag_22 0 YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW YOUR DIFFERENCE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE BECAUSE SCOTCH CAN'T BE EXCHANGED WITH ANY OTHER WHISKEY
HbVG129GEag_23 0 IT'S GOT A VERY DISTINCT FLAVOR
HbVG129GEag_24 0 AND THESE ARE ALCOHOL SUBSTITUTIONS

hAZ1s7unT5g_1 0 HI MY NAME IS REBECCA AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO BECOME A FASHION DESIGNER
hAZ1s7unT5g_2 0 THERE ARE TWO ROUTES TO DOING IT
hAZ1s7unT5g_3 0 THE FIRST ONE QUITE OBVIOUSLY IS TO STUDY FASHION DESIGN IN A SCHOOL THAT HAS THAT AS A DISCIPLINE
hAZ1s7unT5g_4 0 THE OTHER WAY WORKS FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TOO
hAZ1s7unT5g_5 0 IT'S TO JUST START
hAZ1s7unT5g_6 0 ONE WAY IS TO JUST GET ANY JOB IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY
hAZ1s7unT5g_7 0 YOU COULD BE MANAGING THE SAMPLE ROOM FOR A FASHION HOUSE OR EVEN A SMALLER BRAND
hAZ1s7unT5g_8 0 OR YOU COULD BE AN ASSISTANT TO A DESIGNER SO WHILE YOU MIGHT NOT BE DOING FASHION STUFF YOU WILL BE LEARNING ALL ABOUT THE FASHION INDUSTRY
hAZ1s7unT5g_9 0 THE OTHER WAY IS TO JUST START YOUR OWN COMPANY
hAZ1s7unT5g_10 0 YES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BUT IF YOU FOCUS ON VERY VERY LIMITED ITEMS IN THE BEGINNING MAYBE FIVE OR LESS AND JUST MAKE THAT WORK YOU CAN GROW A COMPANY FROM THERE
hAZ1s7unT5g_11 0 ANOTHER THING TO DO TO GET EXPERIENCE WHETHER YOU'RE ENTERING THE FIELD JUST OUT OF STUDYING OR WHETHER YOU WANT TO ADVANCE FROM SOMETHING LIKE A DESIGN ASSISTANT INTO A MORE RESPONSIBLE AND CREATIVE POSITION IS TO DO PROJECTS COMPANIES
hAZ1s7unT5g_12 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ON FULL TIME
hAZ1s7unT5g_13 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PAID
hAZ1s7unT5g_14 0 YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND COMPANIES THAT ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU AND PROJECTS YOU LIKE TO DO IN ORDER TO RAISE YOUR EXPERIENCE LEVEL
hAZ1s7unT5g_15 0 ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING IN BECOMING A FASHION DESIGNER IS TO ALWAYS BE DEVELOPING AND IMPROVING YOUR SKILL LEVEL
hAZ1s7unT5g_16 0 THAT MEANS KNOWING ALL THE LATEST PROGRAMS ON THE COMPUTER AS WELL AS HAVING THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL TO DO THE SEWING AND THE PATTERN MAKING EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE DOING THAT IN THE WORK FORCE
hAZ1s7unT5g_17 0 SO THOSE ARE A FEW THINGS TO THINK ABOUT WHEN CHOOSING A CAREER IN FASHION DESIGN
hGAW-Jk8I2k_1 0 HI I'M DR GARRETT SMITH FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL EXERCISES FOR THE LOWER BODY THE AIR SQUAT'
hGAW-Jk8I2k_2 0 SOME PEOPLE KNOW IT AS THE BODY WEIGHT SQUAT BECAUSE IT'S JUST YOUR BODY WEIGHT
hGAW-Jk8I2k_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO START FROM THE GROUND UP ON FORM TIPS
hGAW-Jk8I2k_4 0 THE AIR SQUAT I'LL SHOW YOU ONE FIRST

hGAW-Jk8I2k_6 0 SO I'LL GO DOWN TO THE BOTTOM POSITION AND SHOW YOU SOME THINGS THERE
hGAW-Jk8I2k_7 0 I'M GOING TO START FROM THE GROUND UP AGAIN LIKE I SAID
hGAW-Jk8I2k_9 0 YOUR WEIGHT IS ON THE HEELS IN THIS EXERCISE
hGAW-Jk8I2k_10 0 IMPORTANT THING IS HOW WIDE APART ARE YOUR LEGS
hGAW-Jk8I2k_11 0 BASICALLY SHOULDER WIDTH IS A GREAT WIDTH
hGAW-Jk8I2k_12 0 IF YOU NEED TO GO A LITTLE WIDER OR A LITTLE NARROWER THAT'S OKAY TOO
hGAW-Jk8I2k_13 0 TOES ARE TURNED SLIGHTLY OUT
hGAW-Jk8I2k_14 0 THEY'RE STRAIGHT AHEAD AND THEY'RE NOT WAY TURNED OUT LIKE A BALLERINA
hGAW-Jk8I2k_15 0 GOT FEET DONE NOW KNEES
hGAW-Jk8I2k_16 0 KNEES FOR MOST PEOPLE YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE PUSHING YOUR KNEES OUT
hGAW-Jk8I2k_17 0 YOU WANT YOUR KNEES TO STAY OVER YOUR FEET
hGAW-Jk8I2k_18 0 THEY'RE GOING TO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE PUSHED OUT
hGAW-Jk8I2k_20 0 THE DEPTH ON SQUATS ON AIR SQUATS'
hGAW-Jk8I2k_21 0 YOU WANT THE TOP OF YOUR HIP CREASE TO BE BELOW THE TOP OF YOUR KNEE OR AT LEAST LEVEL WITH IT
hGAW-Jk8I2k_22 0 WHEN YOU'RE IN THIS POSITION THIS IS ABOUT AS DEEP AS I NEED TO GO
hGAW-Jk8I2k_24 0 I'M GOING TO TURN SIDEWAYS SO YOU CAN SEE THIS
hGAW-Jk8I2k_26 0 YOU WANT YOUR LOWER BACK IN THE BOTTOM POSITION TO HAVE THE NICE LUMBAR CURVE TO IT
hGAW-Jk8I2k_27 0 WHAT WE CALL A NEUTRAL SPINE
hGAW-Jk8I2k_28 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THIS
hGAW-Jk8I2k_29 0 IF YOU SEE YOUR HIPS TUCKED UNDER AND THE LUMBAR CURVE FLIPPING THE OTHER DIRECTION YOU'VE GONE TO FAR AND YOU LIKELY HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY ISSUES
hGAW-Jk8I2k_30 0 LUMBAR CURVE NEEDS TO BE MAINTAINED
hGAW-Jk8I2k_31 0 I'M GOING TO GO DOWN AND SHOW YOU THE NEXT PART THE THORACIC SPINE
hGAW-Jk8I2k_32 0 WHEN WE GO DOWN TO THE BOTTOM WE WANT THIS PART OF OUR SPINE THE RIB CAGE PART OF OUR SPINE THE THORACIC SPINE TO BE AS STRAIGHT UP AS POSSIBLE
hGAW-Jk8I2k_34 0 ARMS ARE OUT IN FRONT FOR BALANCE
hGAW-Jk8I2k_35 0 YOU CAN AS A TEACHING TOOL KEEP THEM HIGHER AND THIS WILL ALSO HELP YOU TO KEEP YOUR LUMBAR CURVE
hGAW-Jk8I2k_36 0 'AIR SQUATS FROM THE SIDE WILL LOOK LIKE THIS
hGAW-Jk8I2k_37 0 AS YOU START GOING FASTER YOU CAN START USING THE ARMS IN KIND OF A PUMPING MANNER TO HELP GIVE YOU A LITTLE EXTRA PUSH
hGAW-Jk8I2k_38 0 'AIR SQUATS ARE THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL EXERCISE FOR THE LOWER BODY
hGAW-Jk8I2k_39 0 INCREDIBLE TOOL AND YOU CAN DO THEM THERE'S PEOPLE OUT THERE DOING MORE THAN ONE OF THOSE A SECOND
hGAW-Jk8I2k_40 0 YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THEM IN YOUR ROUTINE
gxnEq3a7zso_1 0 NOW LET'S SAY WE WANTED TO FIND FONT FOR JUST THIS SPECIFIC SECTION
gxnEq3a7zso_2 0 NOW WE CAN DO THAT REALLY EASILY AND WE CAN CHANGE THE COLOR AND THE SIZE TO
gxnEq3a7zso_3 0 AND TO DO IT WE DO IT LIKE THIS SO LET'S PICK SAY THE FIRST PARAGRAPH HERE
gxnEq3a7zso_4 0 WE WOULD JUST GO IN HERE AND DO FONT FACE = YOU KNOW LET'S DO COURIER COMMA OOPS FORGOT THE EQUALS COURIER COMMA COURIER NEW AND END THAT
gxnEq3a7zso_5 0 AND THEN WITHIN THIS FONT FACE BRACKET WE CAN ALSO CHANGE THE COLOR TO LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND HIT SAVE
gxnEq3a7zso_6 0 WE CAN CHANGE THE SIZE IT'S ALL THE SAME
gxnEq3a7zso_7 0 LET'S SEE NOW THIS TEXT HAS BECOME BURGUNDY AND IT'S GONE FROM BEING A NICE HELVETICA TO A COURIER NEW
gxnEq3a7zso_8 0 BUT YOU NOTICE RIGHT HERE THAT I HAD MEANT FOR IT TO BE JUST ONE PARAGRAPH AND IT ENDED UP BEING TWO
gxnEq3a7zso_9 0 THAT'S BECAUSE I FORGOT TO CLOSE OUT MY FONT BRACKET AT THE END OF THIS PARAGRAPH
gxnEq3a7zso_10 0 AND SO IT JUST KEPT GOING UNTIL THE PREVIOUS ONE HAD BEEN CLOSED OUT
gxnEq3a7zso_11 0 SO TO FIX THAT IF WE WERE TO FIX IT I WOULD GO UP HERE AND CLOSE IT OFF RIGHT HERE HIT SAVE AND REFRESH
gxnEq3a7zso_12 0 AND NOW IT'S JUST THE PARAGRAPH THAT I HAD WANTED
gOit1Rfov7I_1 0 THIS EXERCISE I'M GOING TO PERFORM IS FOR THE QUADS WHICH IS THE FRONT PART OF YOUR LEG AND ALSO THE HAMSTRINGS WHICH IS THE BACK PART OF YOUR LEGS AND ALSO WORKS OUT YOUR GLUTES
gOit1Rfov7I_2 0 NOW THE STANCE YOU SHOULD BE IN IS YOUR FEET SHOULD BE SHOULDER WIDTH APART

gOit1Rfov7I_4 0 I LIKE USUALLY PUTTING THE HANDS IN THE FRONT
gOit1Rfov7I_5 0 SLOWLY COME DOWN
gOit1Rfov7I_6 0 PUSH OFF THE HEEL
gOit1Rfov7I_7 0 COME BACK UP SQUEEZING YOUR QUADS AND YOUR HAMSTRINGS AND CONTINUE THE SAME MOTION FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY REPS
gOit1Rfov7I_8 0 SINCE YOU ARE NOT DOING IT WITH ANY TYPE OF WEIGHT DUMBBELL OR BARBELL YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO KEEP IT HIGH REPS SINCE IT'S SO LOW ON WEIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST DOING YOUR BODY WEIGHT SO CONTINUE THIS MOTION AGAIN FOR ABOUT TWENTY REPS OF THREE TO FOUR SETS AND THAT'S THE FREESTANDING SQUAT

GSI205wpQsw_8 0 THEN WIPE THE RAZOR ON A TOWEL
GSI205wpQsw_9 0 THEN RINSE THE BLADE UNDER HOT WATER AGAIN BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HEAT IT UP BEFORE IT TOUCHES YOUR SKIN
GSI205wpQsw_10 0 A HOT BLADE IS GOING TO CUT THE HAIR MUCH EASIER THAN A COLD BLADE WILL
GSI205wpQsw_11 0 ANOTHER REASON IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF BACTERIA THAT BUILDS UP ALONG THE EDGE OF THE RAZOR
GSI205wpQsw_12 0 IF YOU CUT YOURSELF WITH THE RAZOR THAT BACTERIA CAN GET IN THE CUT AND CAUSE SOME REDNESS AND SWELLING
GSI205wpQsw_13 0 IF YOU CONTINUALLY WASH OUT THE BLADE THEN YOU'RE WASHING OUT SOME OF THAT BACTERIA
GSI205wpQsw_14 0 YOU SOMETIMES SEE PEOPLE FILL UP A SKIN WITH HOT WATER AND THEY SWISH THEIR RAZOR IN THERE TO CLEAN OUT THE BLADE
GSI205wpQsw_15 0 THE PROBLEM IS THAT'S DIRTY WATER
GSI205wpQsw_16 0 YOU'RE NOT REALLY CLEANING YOUR BLADE
GSI205wpQsw_17 0 PLUS THAT WATER IS NOT GOING TO STAY HOT FOR VERY LONG
GSI205wpQsw_18 0 USE HOT WATER FROM THE FAUCET
GSI205wpQsw_19 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE IT RUNNING ALL THE TIME
GSI205wpQsw_20 0 JUST LEAVE IT ENOUGH SO THAT THE WATER STAYS HOT
HfMtsNEfXOU_1 0 HI THIS IS JON AND IN THIS CLIP WE WILL BE ATTACHING THE HANDLE
HfMtsNEfXOU_2 0 TO ATTACH THE HANDLE WE WANT TO MAKE IT VERY SECURE SO WHEN YOU LIFT UP IT DOESN'T PULL OUT
HfMtsNEfXOU_3 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO PUT A COUPLE OF SCREWS IN EACH SIDE THAT ARE GOING TO BE AN ANGLE GOING DOWNWARD INTO OUR HANDLE
HfMtsNEfXOU_4 0 ADDITIONALLY WE ARE GOING TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF GLUE ON IT JUST TO GIVE IT THAT ADDED HOLDING POWER
HfMtsNEfXOU_5 0 FIRST I'M JUST GOING TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF GLUE ALONG THE INSIDE OF THE EDGES AND I'M GOING TO SLIP MY HANDLE INTO PLACE
HfMtsNEfXOU_6 0 NEXT I'M JUST GOING TO BE DRILLING A PILOT HOLE THROUGH MY SIDE INTO MY HANDLE
HfMtsNEfXOU_7 0 AND AFTER THAT I'M JUST GOING TO INSTALL MY SCREW
HfMtsNEfXOU_8 0 AND ANOTHER SCREW ON THE OTHER SIDE SHOULD DO IT
HfMtsNEfXOU_9 0 NOW DEPENDING ON THE LOOK YOU'RE GOING FOR YOU CAN ALSO COUNTERSINK THESE SCREWS AND EVEN PUT A PLUG OR A BUTTON ON WHERE THAT HOLE WOULD BE
HfMtsNEfXOU_10 0 AND ONCE YOU'VE INSTALLED THAT HANDLE YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT A TEST MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T SHAKE AROUND OR IT'S NOT LOOSE

h1ogj1cUvDw_5 0 THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GOING TO CORRECT THIS
h1ogj1cUvDw_6 0 IF YOUR BALL IS GOING TOO MUCH TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE COURT THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE HITTING IT PROBABLY TOO MUCH IN FRONT OF YOU

GcAximxvi1Y_12 0 THERE'S NO LOOK TO THIS OTHER THAN PUT IT ON
GcAximxvi1Y_13 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOUR SKIN IS COMPLETELY BLENDED AND COVERED IN A LIGHT TO MEDIUM FOUNDATION
GcAximxvi1Y_14 0 UNLESS YOU NEED A FULL COVERAGE FOUNDATION IT'S NOT NECESSARY
GcAximxvi1Y_15 0 MAKE SURE YOU COVER ALL YOUR BLEMISHES
GcAximxvi1Y_16 0 YOU JUST WANT A REALLY SMOOTH PALLET
GcAximxvi1Y_17 0 YOU WANT TO PAINT IT ON SO THAT YOUR SKIN IS COMPLETELY SMOOTH AND CLEAR LIKE A WHITE PIECE OF PAPER BEFORE A PAINTER STARTS PAINTING

h4jjNhftxuE_1 0 MATT GRAHAM NOW YOU'VE CHANGED THE STRINGS ON YOUR GUITAR BUT YOU'VE GOT THE OLD STRINGS THAT YOU TOOK OFF AS WELL AS THESE CLIPPINGS THAT YOU'VE JUST REMOVED FROM THE HEADSTOCK
h4jjNhftxuE_2 0 I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DISPOSING OF THESE PROPERLY
h4jjNhftxuE_3 0 WITH BOTH YOU CAN START WITH THE OLD STRINGS YOU CAN WIND THEM IN A JUST A LOOSE BUNDLE LIKE THIS
h4jjNhftxuE_4 0 AND I HAVE AN OLD PRACTICE GUITAR AT HOME
h4jjNhftxuE_5 0 IT'S KIND OF MY SECOND-STRING GUITAR AND SOMETIMES I'LL IF THESE SETS HAVE A LITTLE LIFE IN THEM I'LL JUST PUT THEM ON THAT GUITAR
h4jjNhftxuE_6 0 SOMETIMES IT'S KIND OF AN OLD-FOLK LEGEND THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY BOIL YOUR STRINGS IN VINEGAR AND WATER AND IT REMOVES A LOT OF THE OILS AND THE DIRT THAT GETS IN BETWEEN THE GROOVES OF THE STRINGS AND CAUSED THEM TO LOSE THEIR LIFE
h4jjNhftxuE_7 0 IT WILL FRESHEN UP THE SOUND OF THESE OLD STRINGS A LITTLE BIT TO DO THAT BUT YEAH GENERALLY UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO SLAP THEM ON AN OLD PRACTICE GUITAR YOU CAN JUST GET RID OF THEM
h4jjNhftxuE_8 0 AND THE WAY I WOULD DO THAT IS YOU WIND YOUR OLD STRINGS AND THEN YOU WOULD TAKE YOUR CLIPPINGS AND VERY CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MANY SHARP ENDS YOU JUST KINDA WRAP THEM INTO A LOOSE BUNDLE AS WELL
h4jjNhftxuE_9 0 IT'S JUST GOING TO MAKE THEM MORE COMPACT
h4jjNhftxuE_10 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO THROW THESE INTO LIKE A PLASTIC GARBAGE BAG OR A PAPER WASTE BASKET BECAUSE THEY MIGHT POKE OUT OF THE TRASH BAG AND CUT SOMEBODY OR POKE SOMEBODY ON THE LEG OR THE ARM
h4jjNhftxuE_11 0 AND SO I LIKE TO TAKE THEM ALL MY BUNDLED STRINGS THAT I'M GOING TO THROW OUT AND JUST PUT THEM BACK INTO THE BOX THAT THE NEW STRINGS CAME FROM AND THAT WILL KEEP THOSE SHARP ENDS FROM POKING OUT AND GETTING IN YOUR BODY
h4jjNhftxuE_12 0 AND THEN I'LL THROW THEM AWAY AND ENJOY THE SOUND OF MY NEW STRINGS
GZwEFMwqoeA_1 0 TINA STULL HI
GZwEFMwqoeA_2 0 I'M TINA STULL AND I DRIVE THE TOP DRAGSTER FOR INTERSTATE BATTERIES
GZwEFMwqoeA_3 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SPONSORSHIP IN THE WORLD OF RACING
GZwEFMwqoeA_4 0 ALONG WITH THE EXTRA EVENTS THAT THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITIES IS THAT IT ALSO INCREASES THE DAYS THAT YOU MIGHT BE AWAY FROM HOME OR AWAY FROM WORK
GZwEFMwqoeA_5 0 AND USUALLY A SPONSOR WILL PART OF IT IS THAT YOU MIGHT DO SOME APPEARANCES OR YOU MIGHT DO SOME OF THEIR PRINT ADS OR WHATEVER
GZwEFMwqoeA_6 0 AND THAT YOU IF YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON WHO LIKES THAT AND LIKES TALKING TO PEOPLE THEN THAT'S A BONUS BUT IF YOU'RE REALLY SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO GO THAT DIRECTION YOU JUST WANT TO GO RACE GETTING YOURSELF IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE OBLIGATED TO DO THAT MIGHT BE A BAD THING
GZwEFMwqoeA_7 0 THE SPONSORS ARE LOOKING AT YOU LIKE A MOVING BILLBOARD AND ALSO THEY'RE LOOKING AT YOU AS WHAT DO THEY THINK OF YOU AS A PERSON
GZwEFMwqoeA_8 0 AND WHEN YOU GO TO A SPONSORSHIP DON'T FORGET THAT THEY'RE BUYING YOU AS A PERSON AND WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT AS WELL AS HOW WELL YOU PERFORM AT THE TRACK
GZwEFMwqoeA_9 0 AND SO WHEN YOU'RE DOING YOUR SPONSORSHIP LET YOUR PERSONALITY SHOW IN THAT PACKET THAT YOU SEND SO THAT THEY CAN DISCOVER A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AND GET TO LIKE YOU AS A PERSON
GZwEFMwqoeA_10 0 AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE BEST WAY TO PULL IN SPONSORSHIPS AT LEAST IN MY CASE
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_2 0 I WANT TO SORT OF TALK TO YOU ABOUT ANOTHER CARD PRINCIPLE AND THE SVENGALI DECK
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_3 0 IN SOME OF THESE OTHER SEGMENTS HERE ON EXPERT VILLAGE I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT CARD FORCING
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_4 0 ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO USE A SVENGALI DECK IS TO FORCE CARDS
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_5 0 I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO LEARN SOME METHODS OF FORCING CARDS THAT USE A REGULAR DECK
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_6 0 SOME DAY YOU'LL HAVE TO PERFORM FOR SOMEBODY AND YOU WON'T HAVE THIS THING IN YOUR POCKET
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_7 0 KNOWING HOW TO FORCE CARDS IS HANDY BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE THE SAME SELECTED CARD BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE DECK WORKS ANY TRICK THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THAT USES A FORCED CARD IN ANY OF THE OTHER SEGMENTS YOU CAN USE THIS FOR
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_8 0 THIS IS ANOTHER METHOD OF FORCING NO MATTE HOW THEY HAVE THE CARD SELECTED
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_9 0 YOU CAN EVEN DO THIS
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_10 0 YOU CAN PUT THE DECK RIGHT ON THE TABLE TELL THEM OKAY JUST CUT THE DECK AND WE'LL USE THE CARD THAT YOU CUT TO AS OUR SELECTED CARD
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_11 0 ANY OF THOSE METHODS THAT YOU CAN USE FOR HAVING A CARD SELECTED FROM A SVENGALI DECK WILL ALSO FUNCTION AS A FORCE
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_12 0 IF YOU GO BACK AND WATCH SOME OF THE FORCING TRICKS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_13 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF OTHER APPLICATIONS HERE AS WELL
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_14 0 THEY WILL CERTAINLY FIT THE BILL BECAUSE THIS ABSOLUTELY A PERFECT WAY TO FORCE A CARD
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_15 0 PRACTICE WITH THIS PRACTICE YOUR OTHER CARD FORCES AS WELL AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME MORE TRICKS
hK2vsJ-fbeY_1 0 JOEL SIEGEL NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT AGAIN THE SECRET WEAPON OF THE RODS
hK2vsJ-fbeY_2 0 SAY YOU'RE IN A KIND OF AN OPEN PASSAGE IN THE MUSIC AND YOU'RE KIND OF MAYBE IT'S A FREE CHORUS
hK2vsJ-fbeY_3 0 YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD UP TO THE CHORUS OR BUILD UP TO THE BRIDGE WHATEVER IT IS
hK2vsJ-fbeY_4 0 IT'S BEEN PRETTY MELLOW BUT YOU CAN THE MUSIC IS INTENSIFYING
hK2vsJ-fbeY_5 0 SO FROM THE TIPS OF THE RODS YOU CAN GO TO THE BUTTS
hK2vsJ-fbeY_6 0 AND YOU CAN DO ANYTHING WITH THESE YOU CAN GO ON THE SWEET SPOT OF THE RIDE YOU CAN DO THE CRASH YOU CAN DO THE DOME
hK2vsJ-fbeY_7 0 EXPERIMENT WITH ALL THESE SOUNDS BUT WHAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THE ABILITY TO GET A NICE WASH AS IF YOU'RE USING MALLETS
hK2vsJ-fbeY_8 0 YOU GET A NICE WASH WITHOUT ALL THE ATTACK AS IF AS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE USING STICKS
hK2vsJ-fbeY_9 0 THAT'S ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT PLAYING WITH THE RODS
hK2vsJ-fbeY_10 0 YOU CAN DO THE SAME THING USING THIS PART AND PLAYING AGAINST THE EDGE OF THE CYMBAL WHICH TO USE IS UP TO YOU
g9vVIho3X78_1 0 OKAY SO THE POLAROID MACHINE I'M USING TODAY IS ACTUALLY IS A COPY SYSTEM
g9vVIho3X78_2 0 IT'S MADE BOTH BY POLAROID AND BY COPY SYSTEM
g9vVIho3X78_3 0 NOW THIS PARTICULAR MACHINE AND THERE ARE QUITE A FEW OF THEM THAT ARE OUT ON THE MARKET AND SOME ARE DIFFERENT
g9vVIho3X78_4 0 I LIKE THIS MACHINE BECAUSE IT LETS ME COPY FLAT ART WHICH GOES RIGHT HERE AS OPPOSED TO OTHER POLAROID TRANSFER MACHINE WHICH MAKES IMAGES FROM SLIDES
g9vVIho3X78_5 0 SLIDES I LOVE SLIDES
g9vVIho3X78_6 0 SLIDE PHOTOGRAPHY IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TONALLY CORRECT PHOTOGRAPHY YOU COULD GET OUT THERE BUT IT'S EXPENSIVE AND IT'S HARD TO DO FOR AMATEURS TO GET A NICELY EXPOSED SLIDE
g9vVIho3X78_7 0 SO WHAT COPY SYSTEM CAME UP WITH WAS A WAY FOR ANYBODY AS LONG AS THEY HAD A FOUR BY SIX FLAT IMAGE EVEN SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT'VE PRINTED OFF OF YOUR COMPUTER THAT YOU COULD STILL MAKE POLAROID TRANSFERS WITH
g9vVIho3X78_8 0 SO THIS IS AN IMAGE
g9vVIho3X78_9 0 ALL I HAVE TO DO IS PUT IT DOWN ON THE SCREEN HERE COVER IT UP AND START TESTING TO SEE HOW MY IMAGE IS GOING TO LOOK
g9vVIho3X78_10 0 I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN HOW TO SET AN IMAGE UP NEXT
gweXLTNbtRk_1 0 AT THIS POINT WE'VE INSTALLED FOUR QUARTS OF OIL
gweXLTNbtRk_2 0 AFTER CHECKING THE OIL LEVEL IT IS JUST OVER THE LOWER HOLE ON THE DIPSTICK WHICH WE HAD SHOWED YOU EARLIER
gweXLTNbtRk_3 0 SO IT HAS ENOUGH OIL IN IT AT THIS TIME BUT ONCE THE OIL FILTER FILLS UP THAT OIL LEVEL IS GOING TO DROP A LITTLE BIT
gweXLTNbtRk_4 0 SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS GO AHEAD AND REMOVE THE TAPE SINCE WE KNOW THERE IS OIL IN THE ENGINE AGAIN AND WE ARE GOING TO START THE VEHICLE AND LET IT RUN MAYBE TWENTY OR THIRTY SECONDS IS ENOUGH TIME AND ALLOW THE OIL FILTER TO FILL UP COMPLETELY WITH OIL
gweXLTNbtRk_5 0 THEN WE ARE GOING TO SHUT THE CAR BACK OFF AND GO UNDER THE HOOD TO CHECK THE OIL LEVEL AGAIN AND WE WILL JUST TOP IT OFF AND MAKE SURE THAT THE OIL IS AT THE CORRECT LEVEL
gweXLTNbtRk_6 0 WE ARE GOING TO START THE ENGINE AND LET IT RUN FOR ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY SECONDS
GdnMMOufRjY_1 0 SO FOR BIG PIGEON WE'RE LIFTING UP ALL THE WAY
GdnMMOufRjY_2 0 THE LAST LITTLE BIT OF LIFTING UP
GdnMMOufRjY_4 0 YOU DROP THE TAIL DOWN
GdnMMOufRjY_5 0 THAT'S A LOT OF JUICE FOR THE HIPS
GdnMMOufRjY_6 0 AND YOU CAN TAKE THE HEEL A LITTLE CLOSER
GdnMMOufRjY_7 0 IT LEAVES A LITTLE BIT OF STRETCH
GdnMMOufRjY_8 0 BUT YOU CAN TAKE THE BACK FOOT IN NICE AND CLOSE
GdnMMOufRjY_9 0 SEE WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY HIPS HERE
GdnMMOufRjY_10 0 AT LEAST I'M YOU KNOW I'M DOING MY BEST
GdnMMOufRjY_11 0 TO BRING THE FRONT OF THAT HIP OVER AND DOWN
GdnMMOufRjY_12 0 SO AT FIRST YOU MAYBE A LITTLE BIT HERE
GdnMMOufRjY_13 0 BUT BRING IT OVER
GdnMMOufRjY_14 0 REAL OVER IT
GdnMMOufRjY_15 0 AND THEN YOU CAN TOUCH YOUR TOE TO YOUR KIDNEY
GdnMMOufRjY_17 0 THIS IS A NICE VARIATION IN THIS SORT OF
GdnMMOufRjY_19 0 TAKE A BREATHER
GdnMMOufRjY_21 0 TOE IN THE ELBOW CROOK OF THE ELBOW UP AND OVER
GdnMMOufRjY_22 0 LITTLE SPACE TURN FORWARD TURN FORWARD
GdnMMOufRjY_24 0 LOTS OF BREATH
GdnMMOufRjY_25 0 THEN IS THE EKA PADA RAJAKAPOTASANA
GdnMMOufRjY_26 0 AGAIN I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO USE THE HAND
GdnMMOufRjY_27 0 THE HAND MAKE AN L SHAPE
GdnMMOufRjY_28 0 COMES THE OUTSIDE EDGE OF THE FOOT
GdnMMOufRjY_29 0 GOT TO GET A GOOD GRIP I THINK ON THE BONES OF THE FOOT
GdnMMOufRjY_30 0 IF YOU HOLD THE TOE
GdnMMOufRjY_31 0 WELL EVERY TIME I'VE HELD THE TOE
GdnMMOufRjY_32 0 IT JUST SLIPS OUT
GdnMMOufRjY_33 0 TAKE IT NICE AND LOW
GdnMMOufRjY_34 0 GOT TO SLIP MYSELF UNDER THIS ARM
GdnMMOufRjY_35 0 MOVE MY SPINE AROUND
GdnMMOufRjY_36 0 HERE WE GO
GdnMMOufRjY_37 0 I GO UNDER THE ARM
GdnMMOufRjY_38 0 A LITTLE SHIFT OF THE HIPS
GdnMMOufRjY_39 0 A LITTLE MOVEMENT THERE OF THE PELVIS
GdnMMOufRjY_40 0 GETTING THE SHOULDER IN LINE WITH THE HIP
GdnMMOufRjY_41 0 HIP IN LINE WITH THE BACK KNEE
GdnMMOufRjY_42 0 SO AS SYMMETRICAL AS I CAN MAKE IT
GdnMMOufRjY_43 0 AND THEN I CAN PULL IN
GdnMMOufRjY_44 0 I CAN PULL OUT
HgwMHei93cA_1 0 THE THIRD ESCAPE IS A TECHNICAL ESCAPE IN A JUDO COMPETITION
HgwMHei93cA_2 0 JUDO COMPETITION IF YOU TANGLE UP THE LEGS YOU HAVE FIVE SECONDS TO HAVE YOUR OPPONENT ESCAPE OR THE REFEREE'S GOING TO GO AHEAD AND LIFT YOU GUYS BACK UP INTO THE GROUND
HgwMHei93cA_4 0 SO FIRST MY LEFT LEG IS GOING TO GO ACROSS AND GRAB AND TRAP ONE OF THE LEGS AND THEN MY RIGHT KNEE IS JUST GOING TO SCOOT UNDERNEATH POP OUT AND I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND JUST CROSS MY LEGS JUST LIKE THIS AND I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND WAIT FOR THE REFEREE TO LIFT US BACK UP
HgwMHei93cA_5 0 FOR THE TIME BEING SARI WOULD BE TRY TO ESCAPE FROM THIS
HgwMHei93cA_6 0 THIS IS VERY HARD TO DO
HgwMHei93cA_7 0 SO THIS IS THE EASIEST WAY TO ESCAPE IN SITUATION LIKE THIS
HgwMHei93cA_8 0 AND THAT'S GOING TO PUSH IT TOWARDS ME WHILE MY RIGHT LEG BENDS DOWN TO HER KNEE AND KNEE'S THROW HER AND THEN MY OTHER FOOT CONNECTS WITH MY LEFT FOOT
HgwMHei93cA_9 0 AND THERE I GO TRAP HER LEG AND SHE HAS FIVE SECONDS TO ESCAPE
HgwMHei93cA_10 0 IF SHE CANNOT GET OUT IN FIVE SECONDS WE MOVE BACK UP
HgwMHei93cA_11 0 SO PRETTY MUCH THE FIRST TWO ESCAPES WERE GOOD IN THE REAL LIFE SITUATION
HgwMHei93cA_12 0 IF YOU WANT TO GET ON TOP OF YOUR OPPONENT AND CONTINUE THE FIGHT OR FINISH THE FIGHT THOSE MOVES SO PERFECT
HgwMHei93cA_13 0 THIS ESCAPE IS MORE JUST FOR TECHNICALITY IN THE TOURNAMENT
HgwMHei93cA_14 0 I WOULDN'T REALLY SUGGEST THIS IN A REAL LIFE SITUATION
HgwMHei93cA_15 0 HOWEVER IT'S BETTER TO HAVE A LEG TANGLED UP IN THE REAL LIFE SITUATION

_gwRhmUQcpk_1 0 HI MY NAME IS LAUREN AND TODAY I'M HERE TO DISCUSS HOW A CURLING WORKS
_gwRhmUQcpk_2 0 WITHIN YOUR CURLING IRON THERE ARE TWO PIECES OF METAL WHICH ARE POOR CONDUCTORS OF HEAT
_gwRhmUQcpk_3 0 AS THE RESISTANCE BUILDS SO DOES THE TEMPERATURE AND THE TEMPERATURE IS VERY EVEN AND THE INCREASE IS STEADILY
_gwRhmUQcpk_4 0 YOU CAN ADJUST YOUR TEMPERATURE THROUGH YOUR TEMPERATURE GAUGE ON YOUR CURLING IRON
_gwRhmUQcpk_5 0 FINER HAIR YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO USE MORE OF A BIT OF A LOWER TEMPERATURE
_gwRhmUQcpk_6 0 COARSER HAIR YOU CAN USE A HIGHER TEMPERATURE
_gwRhmUQcpk_7 0 YOUR HAIR CAN HANDLE IT A BIT BETTER
_gwRhmUQcpk_8 0 AS YOU GO THROUGH YOUR HAIR YOU'RE GOING TO PICK IT UP
_gwRhmUQcpk_9 0 THE REASON WHY THIS WORKS AND THE REASON WHY IT CHANGES IS THE HEAT ACTUALLY ALTERS THE HYDROGEN BONDS IN YOUR HAIR
_gwRhmUQcpk_10 0 THE HYDROGEN BONDS WILL HELP YOU TO TEMPORARILY CHANGE THE HAIR TEXTURE OF YOUR HAIR AND IT CREATE FROM STRAIGHT HAIR A NICE WAVE
_gwRhmUQcpk_11 0 THERE ARE THREE BONDS THAT YOUR HAIR IS COMPRISED OF AND THAT IS THE HYDROGEN BOND THE SALT BOND AND THE DISULFIDE BOND
_gwRhmUQcpk_12 0 YOUR DISULFIDE BOND IS WHAT ACTUALLY PREDICTS YOUR HAIR TEXTURE
_gwRhmUQcpk_13 0 THE HYDROGEN BOND IS A TEMPORARY WAY IN ORDER TO BREAK THAT BOND DOWN AND CURL YOUR HAIR IF YOUR HAIR IS VERY STRAIGHT
_gwRhmUQcpk_14 0 IT WILL HELP TO KIND OF GIVE YOU VERSATILITY WITHIN YOUR STYLE AND GO FROM CURLY TO STRAIGHT AND BACK AGAIN AND THAT IS HOW CURLING IRONS WORK
GoYK3crrslw_2 0 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS BARRY BERGMAN AND TODAY I AM HERE TO GIVE YOU TIPS ON THE MUSIC INDUSTRY
GoYK3crrslw_3 0 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU STICK TO YOUR GUNS WHEN MAKING YOUR MUSIC
GoYK3crrslw_4 0 THE LABELS WILL TRY TO TURN YOU INTO SOMETHING THEY THINK YOU SHOULD BE AND IT WILL NEVER EVER SERVE YOU RIGHT
GoYK3crrslw_5 0 YOU HAVE TO BE TRUE TO WHO YOU ARE AND BEING TRUE TO WHO YOU ARE YOU GOT TO BE TRUE TO YOUR MUSIC
GoYK3crrslw_6 0 YES YOU NEED A HIT SINGLE IN THIS MARKET PLACE TODAY BECAUSE IT IS MORE ABOUT TRACKS TODAY THAN IT IS ABOUT ALBUMS BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU NEED NOT TO CHANGE WHO YOU ARE TO GET SIGNED OR TO TRY TO SELL YOUR MUSIC
GoYK3crrslw_7 0 THERE IS A MARKET FOR EVERYTHING AND IT IS A MATTER OF THE LABELS FINDING THAT MARKET
GoYK3crrslw_8 0 SO YOU GOT TO DO YOUR BEST NOT TO HAVE THE A&R DEPARTMENT WHOM IN A LOT OF CASES ARE FRUSTRATED ARTISTS TRY TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING
Gz126LFbmqs_1 0 OK NOW THAT WE'VE GOT IT HERE GO IN CHECK IT FOR THE THICKNESS AGAIN
Gz126LFbmqs_2 0 IT'S THIN ENOUGH
Gz126LFbmqs_3 0 YOU CAN TELL
Gz126LFbmqs_4 0 IT ALMOST FELL APART
Gz126LFbmqs_5 0 GO IN COLLAR IT WITH YOUR FINGERS AND IT PULLS OFF NOT A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE JUST WANT THIS LITTLE BIT DOWN HERE ANYWAY
Gz126LFbmqs_6 0 SO GO AHEAD AND TAKE THE END OF YOUR NEEDLE TOOL
Gz126LFbmqs_7 0 IT'S A PRETTY GOOD TOOL TO USE FOR THIS
Gz126LFbmqs_8 0 JUST START THROWING IT UP YOUR NEEDLE TOOL
Gz126LFbmqs_9 0 THE NEEDLE TOOL WILL KEEP IT FROM GETTING TOO SMALL IN THERE
Gz126LFbmqs_10 0 AND YOU WANT IT ALMOST AS WIDE AS YOUR NEEDLE TOOL BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GET SOME SHRINKAGE WHEN IT HITS THE TEMPERATURES WE'RE GOING TO WITH THESE POTS
Gz126LFbmqs_11 0 IT SHOULD BE ABOUT 2300 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT IN THE STONEWARE
Gz126LFbmqs_12 0 AND YOU JUST THROW IT UP AND THEN LET'S BRING A LITTLE RAZZLE DAZZLE TO IT AND THEN WE JUST TAKE IT RIGHT OFF THE HUMP LIKE THAT
Gz126LFbmqs_13 0 THERE WE GO WE HAVE OUR SPOUT AND IT'S PERFECT THE WAY IT BENDS UP LIKE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I WANTED IT TO GO IN THE FRONT HERE
GOvWsNANGi0_1 0 NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THE KLEMHEIST KNOT
GOvWsNANGi0_2 0 THE KLEMHEIST IS ANOTHER KNOT THAT IS USED FOR CLIMBING AND CAVING
GOvWsNANGi0_3 0 I'M NOT A CLIMBER OR CAVER MYSELF SO MAKE SURE YOU TALK TO SOMEONE BEFORE YOU ATTEMPT TO USE THESE KNOTS IN DOING EITHER ONE OF THOSE ACTIVITIES
GOvWsNANGi0_4 0 IF YOU LOOK DOWN HERE YOU CAN SEE I HAVE TWO LINES SET UP
GOvWsNANGi0_5 0 THIS RIGHT HERE WOULD PROBABLY BE MY MAIN LINE
GOvWsNANGi0_6 0 AND OF COURSE I WOULD NOT USE THIS KIND OF ROPE IF I WERE CLIMBING
GOvWsNANGi0_7 0 AND THIS HERE WOULD BE MY LINE THAT I'M GOING TO USE OVER IT
GOvWsNANGi0_8 0 AND AS YOU CAN SEE I'VE ALREADY CREATED A LOOP HERE
GOvWsNANGi0_9 0 SO THIS IS A COMPLETE LOOPED LINE HERE
GOvWsNANGi0_10 0 AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO WRAP IT ONCE KEEPING THE LINES TOGETHER
GOvWsNANGi0_11 0 ONE FULL TURN
GOvWsNANGi0_12 0 TWO FULL TURNS
GOvWsNANGi0_13 0 AND A THIRD FULL TURN YOU CAN GO MORE IF YOU WISH
GOvWsNANGi0_14 0 I'M GOING TO TAKE IT AND I'M GOING TO TAKE IT AND BRING THIS OTHER LOOP THROUGH BRINGING IT DOWN
GOvWsNANGi0_15 0 THIS IS MORE OF NOW THIS IS MORE OF A MECHANICAL KNOT
GOvWsNANGi0_16 0 THIS IS MADE FOR SLIDING
GOvWsNANGi0_17 0 WHEN IT GRABS IT WILL GRIP BUT AS YOU LOOSEN YOUR BODY WEIGHT OFF OF IT ON YOUR OTHER LINE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SLIDE THIS DOWN AND KEEP USING THIS LINE
GOvWsNANGi0_18 0 AND AS YOU ARE CLIMBING DOWN OR CLIMBING UP
GNuVeRndstw_1 0 THE NEXT NECKLINE IS A CAMISOLE NECKLINE
GNuVeRndstw_2 0 AND THE NAME CAMISOLE OBVIOUSLY CONJURES UP REFERENCES TO LINGERIE OR NIGHTGOWNS
GNuVeRndstw_3 0 BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
GNuVeRndstw_4 0 IF YOU LOOK AT IT RIGHT LIKE THIS IT CAN BE A PROM DRESS
GNuVeRndstw_5 0 IT CAN BE ANYTHING
GNuVeRndstw_6 0 PROM DRESS THAT'S REALLY GENERIC
GNuVeRndstw_7 0 IT CAN BE A LOT OF CREATIVE THINGS
GNuVeRndstw_8 0 THE CAMISOLE IS STRICTLY JUST A TITLE
GNuVeRndstw_9 0 DON'T LET IT INFLUENCE YOU AS TO WHERE YOU HAVE TO GO WITH YOUR DESIGN
GNuVeRndstw_10 0 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOMETHING FLIMSY
GNuVeRndstw_11 0 IN ORDER TO DRAW IT WE'LL DO LIKE WE DID ON THE STRAPLESS TOP
GNuVeRndstw_12 0 WE CREATE THE BUST LINE AND THEN BRA STRAP TYPE STRAPS
GNuVeRndstw_13 0 AND THIS IS AGAIN WHERE IT'S UP TO YOU WITH THE VARIATION
GNuVeRndstw_14 0 JUST SIT EVERY TIME YOU DO A DRAWING JUST SIT AND LOOK AT IT AND THINK HOW MANY OTHER WAYS COULD I POTENTIALLY REPRODUCE THIS
GNuVeRndstw_15 0 THE STRAPS THEY CAN CROSS
GNuVeRndstw_16 0 THEY CAN TIE
GNuVeRndstw_17 0 THEY CAN TWIST
GNuVeRndstw_18 0 THERE'S A THOUSAND WAYS OF DOING ANY ONE THING
GNuVeRndstw_19 0 IT'S ALL UP TO YOU
Gb6XMTVm7O8_1 0 ON THIS NEXT CLIP WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE INGREDIENTS THAT WILL BE USED IN THE VEGAN STUFFING
Gb6XMTVm7O8_2 0 THEY CAN BE FRESH OR DRY
Gb6XMTVm7O8_3 0 I'M USING BOTH BOTH MIXED
Gb6XMTVm7O8_4 0 I PREFER FRESH BUT THIS TIME AROUND I DID NOT HAVE IT ALL AVAILABLE
Gb6XMTVm7O8_5 0 I'M GOING TO BE USING KITCHEN BOUQUET TO MIX A LITTLE WATER
Gb6XMTVm7O8_6 0 MORE LIKE A VEGETABLE BROTH
Gb6XMTVm7O8_7 0 YOU CAN USE VEGETABLE BROTH THOUGH
Gb6XMTVm7O8_8 0 I'M GOING TO USE ABOUT SIX SEVEN PIECES OF WHOLE WHEAT BREAD
Gb6XMTVm7O8_9 0 YOU CAN USE SOURDOUGH WHITE BREAD WHATEVER YOU PREFER
Gb6XMTVm7O8_11 0 SIMPLE TABLE SALT
Gb6XMTVm7O8_12 0 I'M GOING TO USE CHOPPED PECANS THAT I DID BAKE
Gb6XMTVm7O8_14 0 PURPLE WHITE DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
Gb6XMTVm7O8_15 0 SAME WITH THE APPLE
Gb6XMTVm7O8_16 0 YOU CAN USE GREEN OR RED
Gb6XMTVm7O8_17 0 I'M GOING TO BE USING SAGE
Gb6XMTVm7O8_18 0 LIKE I SAID YOU CAN USE THE FRESH SAGE IF YOU PREFER
Gb6XMTVm7O8_19 0 THIS IS A POWDER SAGE
Gb6XMTVm7O8_20 0 SAME WITH THE PARSLEY
Gb6XMTVm7O8_21 0 I'M USING SOME PARSLEY FLAKES BUT YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO USE FRESH PARSLEY
Gb6XMTVm7O8_23 0 I THINK FRESH CELERY IS DEFINITELY PREFERRED
Gb6XMTVm7O8_24 0 AND SOME SIMPLE DRIED CRANBERRIES
Gb6XMTVm7O8_25 0 AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST YOU CAN USE MARGARINE OR A LITTLE BIT OF OIL
Gb6XMTVm7O8_26 0 REMEMBER THIS MARGARINE HAS NO DAIRY IN IT
Gb6XMTVm7O8_27 0 SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT A VEGAN STUFFING
Gb6XMTVm7O8_28 0 BUT THAT'S WHAT I'LL BE USING TO GREASE THE PAN
Gb6XMTVm7O8_29 0 AND THAT'S ALL THE INGREDIENTS YOU'LL BE NEEDING TO USE IN A VEGETARIAN STUFFING
h39vEROaZc4_1 0 NOW THE FRAME THAT WE'VE CREATED NEEDS A WAY TO STAND UP ONTO THE BASE OF OUR STAGE SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE THE WOODEN STICKS GO INSIDE THE CORRUGATED PAPER AND THAT WILL CREATE A STAND IN ORDER FOR US TO STICK INSIDE THE BASE OF THE STAGE
h39vEROaZc4_2 0 SO IF WE CUT OUR STRIPS CORRECTLY THE LINES OF THE CORRUGATED PAPER SHOULD BE RUNNING ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE STRIP
h39vEROaZc4_3 0 SO I HAVE ROOM TO TAKE A THIN SKEWER AND PUT IT INSIDE THE OPENING OF THE CORRUGATED PAPER
h39vEROaZc4_4 0 WHAT I FIRST WANT TO DO IS I DON'T WANT TO USE THE FULL LENGTH OF THE STICK IT'S NOT NECESSARY SO I'M GOING TO CUT A PIECE AND I'M GOING TO BE LEFT WITH A PIECE PROBABLY ABOUT FIVE INCHES IS A GOOD SIZE
h39vEROaZc4_5 0 AND I CUT TWO STICKS LIKE THAT
h39vEROaZc4_6 0 AND THEN I GO AHEAD AND STICK IT INSIDE THE CORRUGATED PAPER
h39vEROaZc4_7 0 IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE GETTING IT IN IF YOU DIDN'T USE A THICK ENOUGH CORRUGATED PAPER YOU CAN TWIST THE STICK BACK AND FORTH AND IT WILL SLIDE IN OR YOU CAN JUST PRESS IT DOWN ONTO A HARD SURFACE BECAUSE THE STICK SHOULD FIT RIGHT INTO RUN ALONG THE LINES OF THE CORRUGATED PAPER
h39vEROaZc4_8 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT PUSHING ITSELF OUT OR TEARING THE FRAME
h39vEROaZc4_9 0 SO WE PUT IT IN HIGH ENOUGH SO THAT IT CREATES IT WILL BE STURDY IT WILL CREATE A NICE BASE AND WE SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH LEFT OUT TO BE ABLE TO STICK INTO THE BASE OF THE STAGE
h39vEROaZc4_10 0 IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE PART OF THE STICK THAT'S STICKING OUT SHOULD BE BOTH OF THEM SHOULD BE EVEN SO THAT THE FRAME STANDS STRAIGHT UP AND BY THE WEIGHT OF THE BORDER THE THICKNESS OF THE CORRUGATED PAPER AND ALSO THE STICKS THAT ARE INSIDE THIS WILL CREATE A NICE STRONG STURDY SUPPORT TO LET THE BORDER STAND UP STRAIGHT ONTO THE BASE OF THE STAGE
h39vEROaZc4_11 0 SO NOW I'VE SHOWN YOU HOW TO INSERT THE WOODEN SKEWER STICKS INTO THE PICTURE FRAME BORDER SO THAT IT WILL STAND ERECT ONTO THE BASE OF OUR PUPPET STAGE THEATER
GB_WkgKzw1A_1 0 NOW THAT WE'VE GOT THIS PIECE CENTERED AND OPENED IT'S TIME TO PULL THE WALLS
GB_WkgKzw1A_2 0 YOU CAN SEE THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT HERE BUT WE DON'T NEED MUCH BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT THIS TO BE TERRIBLY HIGH
GB_WkgKzw1A_3 0 TAKE YOUR RIGHT THUMB AND PUSH UNDERNEATH
GB_WkgKzw1A_4 0 GIVE IT A NICE UNDERCUT
GB_WkgKzw1A_5 0 TAKE YOUR LEFT HAND AND I'M GOING TO BE PINCHING WITH THIS LEFT HAND WITH MY LEFT THUMB UNDERNEATH MY LEFT INDEX FINGER
GB_WkgKzw1A_6 0 I'M GOING TO USE MY RIGHT HAND AS A STABILIZER AND ALSO TO SQUEEZE THE SPONGE IF I NEED A LITTLE BIT OF LUBRICATION
GB_WkgKzw1A_7 0 THE FIRST PULL I'M JUST GOING TO GO STRAIGHT UP I'M NOT GOING TO GO OUT AT ALL
GB_WkgKzw1A_8 0 THE REASON FOR THIS IS IF YOU START OUT WITH YOUR FIRST PULL GOING OUT YOU'RE GOING END UP WITH THIS PROBABLY FALLING OVER
GB_WkgKzw1A_9 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO LAY IT OUT UNTIL YOU'RE CLOSE TO THE THICKNESS THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
GB_WkgKzw1A_10 0 NOW I'M GOING TO TAKE MY HARD RIB I'M GOING TO PUSH IN AT THE BASE I'M GOING TO THIN THIS OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE UNTIL IT'S ABOUT THE HEIGHT I'M LOOKING FOR
GB_WkgKzw1A_11 0 AT THIS POINT I'M GOING TO LAY THIS DOWN
GB_WkgKzw1A_12 0 THE WAY I'M GOING TO DO THAT IS BY TAKING MY WOODEN RIB USING MY SPONGE AS SUPPORT FROM THE OUTSIDE AND JUST PUSHING THAT WALL OUT AT AN ANGLE
GB_WkgKzw1A_13 0 NOW I'VE GOT THE ANGLE THAT I'M LOOKING FOR AND THE HEIGHT AND I'M READY TO MAKE THE INDENTIONS FOR THE PIE PLATE
GK7-ym-Uo3c_1 0 HI MY NAME IS NATE MCCULLOUGH ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GK7-ym-Uo3c_2 0 IN THESE CLIPS WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE PROPER WAY TO INSPECT AND ADJUST YOUR DRUM STYLE REAR BRAKES
GK7-ym-Uo3c_3 0 IN THIS CLIP WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE TOOLS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO INSPECT AND ADJUST YOUR DRUM STYLE REAR BRAKES
GK7-ym-Uo3c_4 0 I HAVE MY FOUR WAY HERE FOR REMOVAL OF YOUR VEHICLES LUG NUTS
GK7-ym-Uo3c_5 0 I HAVE A HAMMER FOR BREAKING LOOSE MY VEHICLES BRAKING DRUM
GK7-ym-Uo3c_6 0 I HAVE MY SIDE CUTS ALSO REFERRED TO AS DYKES FOR ADJUSTMENT OF THE REAR BRAKES
GK7-ym-Uo3c_7 0 I HAVE MY MAGNETIC TRAY FOR MY LUG NUTS AND ANY OTHER DEVICES OR FASTENERS THAT WE MAY NEED TO TAKE OFF
GK7-ym-Uo3c_8 0 I HAVE MY JACK STAND
GK7-ym-Uo3c_9 0 IT'S A SAFETY DEVICE COMPLETE WITH RELEASE HANDLE AND MY HEAVY DUTY HYDRAULIC FLOOR JACK
GK7-ym-Uo3c_10 0 THESE ARE THE TOOLS REQUIRED
G55W2Zl2sxw_1 0 IN CHINESE MEDICINE BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT FLAVORS AND HOW THEY ASSOCIATE WITH THE ORGANS AND SWEET BEING THE MAIN FLAVOR THAT AFFECTS THE ENERGETIC SPLEEN ITS IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW SWEETENERS MAY AFFECT US
G55W2Zl2sxw_2 0 SO WE DON'T WANT TOO MUCH TOO STRONG AND WE DON'T WANT TOO LITTLE OF ANYTHING
G55W2Zl2sxw_3 0 SO WE TALK ABOUT NATURAL SWEETENERS AND WHAT MAY BE THE BEST
G55W2Zl2sxw_4 0 IN ACTUALITY IN CHINESE MEDICINE ANYTHING THAT IS EXTRACTED AND INTENSIFIED AND SWEETENED IS REALLY ISN'T THE BEST THING FOR US
G55W2Zl2sxw_5 0 SO THERE'S DEBATE AS TO WHETHER THE BROWN SUGAR OR THE WHITE SUGAR OR WHETHER THE CACTUS SUGAR OR EVEN THE NATURAL SWEETENERS LIKE STEVIA HOW THEY MAY EFFECT US
G55W2Zl2sxw_6 0 ULTIMATELY IF THEY'RE VERY VERY SWEET AND EVEN MORE SWEET THAN SUGAR WE FIND THAT IT S DETRIMENTAL OVER TIME
G55W2Zl2sxw_7 0 SO FROM A CHINESE PERSPECTIVE WE WANT TO MINIMIZE OUR SWEETENERS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO OVERREACT ON THE SPLEEN CAUSING A DYSFUNCTION IN THE CHI AND ULTIMATELY HURTING OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM AND OUR DIGESTIVE FUNCTION
G55W2Zl2sxw_8 0 BUT FROM A MORE PRACTICAL STANDPOINT WE DO LIKE OUR SWEETENERS AND SO IN GENERAL I RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE USE STEVIA IN PARTICULAR FROM A NATURAL PERSPECTIVE GROW THE PLANT YOURSELF AND USE THE FRESH LEAF
G55W2Zl2sxw_9 0 THE MORE THAT WE EXTRACT THINGS THE MORE WE REFINE THEM THE LESS NUTRIENTS AND THE GREATER THE POTENTIAL FOR HARM BOTH FROM AN ENERGETIC PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS A TRUTH PERSPECTIVE OF EXTRACTING CHEMICALS
G_-bXLlCzfE_1 0 MY NAME IS JOSEPH SHUNG CHIANG LEE
G_-bXLlCzfE_2 0 I AM A MEMBER OF THE CALCUTTA RACING PIGEON CLUB
G_-bXLlCzfE_3 0 THE BIRDS ARE RELEASED ABOUT SIX THIRTY IN THE MORNING
G_-bXLlCzfE_4 0 THEY FLY AND THEY DO EXERCISE AND AFTER THAT EXERCISE THEY ARE ALLOWED TO REST FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AND THEN THEY ARE PUT BACK INTO THE LOFT
G_-bXLlCzfE_5 0 THEY ARE FED LIGHT BREAKFAST LITTLE BIT
G_-bXLlCzfE_6 0 THE MAIN FEED IS GIVEN IN THE EVENING TIME LIKE ABOUT FOUR 00 AND ALL THAT
G_-bXLlCzfE_7 0 THAT IS THE TIME THEY ARE GIVEN THE FULL FEED AND THEN OF COURSE IN ADDITION WE GIVE GRITS
G_-bXLlCzfE_8 0 THE GRITS ARE MADE UP OF GRINDED BRICKS CHARCOAL THE CAUGHT FISH THAT BONES THEY ARE GRINDED UP SOME EGG SHELLS EVEN ROCK SALT SAND IS MIXED WITH IT
G_-bXLlCzfE_9 0 THESE ARE TO HELP THEM DIGEST THEIR FOOD AND TO GIVE THEM SOME MINERALS SUPPLEMENTS
G_-bXLlCzfE_10 0 OF COURSE SOME PEOPLE DO GIVE SOME MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS POWDER THAT WE GET FROM THE POULTRY FARM AND ALL THAT
G_-bXLlCzfE_11 0 LIKE DURING THE RACING TIME WE ALWAYS ADD IN THE DRINKING WATER ELECTROLYTES OR MAYBE GLUTENS OR GLUCOSE WATER THAT WE MAKE AND GIVE TO THEM
GvhVzLUlZGY_1 0 SO ONCE YOU'VE GOT ALL THE SIDES CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER YOU WANT TO TAKE THE BOTTOM PIECE
GvhVzLUlZGY_2 0 NOW THIS IS THE BOTTOM SIDE OF MY BOTTOM PIECE
GvhVzLUlZGY_3 0 IT'S STILL GOT THE CANVAS TEXTURE FROM WHEN I ROLLED IT
GvhVzLUlZGY_4 0 AND I WENT AHEAD AND PUT MY STAMP THAT I USE OR YOU CAN CARVE IN YOUR SIGNATURE
GvhVzLUlZGY_5 0 THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO DO THAT
GvhVzLUlZGY_6 0 BECAUSE LATER ON IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT
GvhVzLUlZGY_7 0 SO FLIP IT RIGHT SIDE UP TO THE SMOOTH SIDE AND THEN GET AN AREA MOIST THAT'S GOING TO BE IN FAR ENOUGH TO BE AS SMALL AS THIS SQUARE IS HERE
GvhVzLUlZGY_8 0 WHICH IN THIS CASE EACH SIDE IS ABOUT EIGHT INCHES
GvhVzLUlZGY_9 0 SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM SCORING FAR ENOUGH IN THAT THE WALLS ARE GOING TO MEET THAT SCORED AREA
GvhVzLUlZGY_10 0 AGAIN USE A NICE GOOD AMOUNT OF SLIP
GvhVzLUlZGY_11 0 AND YOU CAN JUST DO THE SLIP ON THE BOTTOM HERE
GvhVzLUlZGY_12 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO NECESSARILY DO IT ON THESE BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE PRESSING RIGHT INTO THAT
GvhVzLUlZGY_13 0 SO SCORE THAT UP ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE SLIP ON THERE
GvhVzLUlZGY_14 0 AND THEN ALSO MOISTEN THE BOTTOMS OF ALL OF YOUR WALLS AND GET THEM REALLY WELL SCORED AND MOISTENED
GvhVzLUlZGY_15 0 AND ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT YOU CAN PUT THEM TOGETHER AND I'LL SHOW YOU THAT NEXT
grOFjMzA9EQ_1 0 SO IN ORDER TO MAKE YOUR LID FIT YOUR BOWL JUST PERFECTLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO USE A TOOL CALLED A CALIPER
grOFjMzA9EQ_2 0 AND YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TWO PAIR IN ORDER TO DO ANY KIND OF LID FITTING PROPERLY
grOFjMzA9EQ_3 0 THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO THESE CALIPERS CAN BE OPENED THIS WAY OR THEY CAN CRISSCROSS EACH OTHER TO GO THIS WAY
grOFjMzA9EQ_4 0 AND WHEN YOU TAKE THE INTERIOR MEASUREMENT OF SOMETHING YOU WANT TO HAVE THEM CRISSCROSSED LIKE THIS
grOFjMzA9EQ_5 0 NOW YOU WANT TO HOLD YOUR CALIPERS DIRECTLY OVER THE CENTER LINE OF YOUR PIECE SO THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE MAXIMUM DIAMETER MEASUREMENT
grOFjMzA9EQ_6 0 AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO ADJUST YOUR CALIPERS AND HOLD THEM OVER THE PIECE UNTIL THE CORNERS OF THE CALIPERS TOUCH JUST AT THE VERY TOP OF YOUR LID GALLERY
grOFjMzA9EQ_7 0 YOU WANT THAT WIDEST MEASUREMENT
grOFjMzA9EQ_8 0 AND ONCE YOU'VE GOT A MEASUREMENT THAT YOU'RE HAPPY WITH YOU TAKE THIS FIRST PAIR OF CALIPERS AND YOU LINE THE SECOND PAIR OF CALIPERS UP TOUCHING THE EDGES OF THE FIRST PAIR OF CALIPERS SO THAT YOUR MEASUREMENT IS THIS WAY BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO MEASURE THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR LID RATHER THAN THE INSIDE
grOFjMzA9EQ_9 0 AND NOW WE'RE READ TO THROW THE LID
GYVAfGVJ5hA_1 0 HI THIS AARON HALE DOWN AT FITNESS FOR LIFE IN WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINE
GYVAfGVJ5hA_2 0 AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TREADMILL BUYING GUIDE
GYVAfGVJ5hA_3 0 KIND OF A REVIEW WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK FOR WHEN WE GO OUT TO BUY A TREADMILL
GYVAfGVJ5hA_4 0 THE FIRST TWO MAJOR FACTORS HEIGHT AND WEIGHT OF THE PERSON THAT'S GOING TO BE USING GOING TO BE THE PRIMARY USER OF THE TREADMILL IS PROBABLY OUR FIRST CONSIDERATION
GYVAfGVJ5hA_5 0 WE NEED TO LOOK FOR A TREADMILL THAT'S GOING TO SUPPORT THAT PERSON BOTH IN HEIGHT AND WEIGHT
GYVAfGVJ5hA_6 0 NUMBER TWO WHAT ARE OUR GOALS AS FAR AS WHAT WE EXPECT TO GET OUT OF THE TREADMILL THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO PURCHASE
GYVAfGVJ5hA_7 0 IS IT GOING TO BE ARE WE JUST GOING TO BE USING IT TO WALK OR MAYBE SOME LITE JOGGING
GYVAfGVJ5hA_8 0 OR IN FACT IS IT GOING TO BE MORE OF A HIGHT IMPACT TREADMILL THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR
GYVAfGVJ5hA_9 0 SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO SUPPORT RUNNING AND SOME OTHER INTERVAL TRAINING THAT USUALLY PUTS A LOT OF WEAR AND TEAR ON A TREADMILL OVER TIME
GYVAfGVJ5hA_10 0 THAT BEING SAID SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK FOR THE SIZE OF THE MOTOR AND THE INCLINE MOTOR ARE PROBABLY ALSO ANOTHER INDICATOR OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF THE TREADMILL
GYVAfGVJ5hA_11 0 OBVIOUSLY A SMALLER MOTOR YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO GET LESS PERFORMANCE OUT OF AND IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT A LOT OF HIGH ACTIVITY AND HIGH IMPACT ACTIVITY OVER A COURSE OF TIME
GYVAfGVJ5hA_12 0 ALSO YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR WARRANTY
GYVAfGVJ5hA_13 0 DOES THE MANUFACTURE REALLY SUPPORT ITS PRODUCT
GYVAfGVJ5hA_14 0 IF IT DOES IT WILL HAVE A VERY LONG TERM WARRANTY NOT ONLY ON THE FRAME BUT ON THE DISPLAY AND ESPECIALLY THE MOTOR
GYVAfGVJ5hA_15 0 A LONG WARRANTY ON A MOTOR IS A WONDERFUL INDICATOR OF HOW THE MANUFACTURER BACKS THEIR PRODUCT
GYVAfGVJ5hA_16 0 AND THOSE ARE THE MAJOR THINGS TO LOOK FOR WHEN BUYING AND PURCHASING A HOME TREADMILL
GYVAfGVJ5hA_17 0 THIS HAS BEEN AARON HALE AT FITNESS FOR LIFE IN WILMINGTON
GYVAfGVJ5hA_18 0 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
g_-CMRhzZ2Y_2 0 I'M TRACY GOODWIN AND I AM THE RED SWEATER LADY AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO GET READY TO SEEK A JOB
g_-CMRhzZ2Y_3 0 NOW YOU'RE SAYING OKAY WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT HOW TO GET READY
g_-CMRhzZ2Y_4 0 WELL THERE ARE ACTUALLY THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD DO BEFORE YOU START REALLY ZEROING IN ON EXACTLY THE JOB THAT YOU WANT
g_-CMRhzZ2Y_5 0 TODAY'S JOB MARKET IS REALLY TOUGH AND IT'S EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE
g_-CMRhzZ2Y_6 0 SO YOU WHEN YOU GO IN TO FINALLY START INTERVIEWING FOR JOBS YOU WANT TO BE REALLY REALLY PREPARED THAT NOT ONLY ARE YOU THE BEST CANDIDATE FOR THE JOB THAT YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THAT JOB AND THAT JOB MIGHT HOLD THE FUTURE FOR YOU
g_-CMRhzZ2Y_7 0 SO THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME THINGS THAT I WANT TO TELL YOU TODAY THAT YOU WANT TO DO AHEAD OF TIME BEFORE YOU START ACTUALLY GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS ON FINDING A JOB
GL8jnO4CT_c_1 0 SO NEXT WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT POP OF COLOR TO GIVE SHERRY THAT REALLY BEAUTIFUL SPRING LOOK
GL8jnO4CT_c_2 0 SO AS YOU SAW WE'RE GOING TO USE THIS REALLY PRETTY PLUM COLOR
GL8jnO4CT_c_3 0 SHERRY HAS REALLY BEAUTIFUL GREEN EYES AND A PLUM IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BRING OUT EVEN MORE
GL8jnO4CT_c_4 0 SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO GO AHEAD AND CLOSE YOUR EYES IS I'M GOING TO USE THAT COLOR RIGHT ON HER LID AND I'M JUST GOING TO PRESS IT RIGHT IN AND I'M NOT SWIPING THE BRUSH BECAUSE ESPECIALLY WITH MORE OF A PIGMENTED COLOR IF YOU SWIPE IT YOU'RE SOMETIMES GOING TO GET THAT FALL DOWN DOWN HERE AND WE REALLY WANT TO AVOID THAT BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY WORKED ON HER EYE MAKEUP OR ON HER SKIN EXCUSE ME
GL8jnO4CT_c_5 0 SO I'M JUST GOING TO PRESS THIS RIGHT IN AND YOU CAN SEE HOW PRETTY THAT IS
GL8jnO4CT_c_6 0 I'M REALLY LOVING HOW THIS LOOKS ON YOUR SKIN SHERRY
GL8jnO4CT_c_7 0 SO BLEND IT RIGHT INTO THE SKIN AND THEN IF YOU NEED TO GO BACK AND GET THE SAME BRUSH THAT YOU USED FOR YOUR CREASE COLOR YOU CAN DO THAT SO IT BLENDS EVERYTHING IN TOGETHER AND YOU CAN SEE HOW PRETTY THAT IS
GL8jnO4CT_c_8 0 AND THEN I'M ALSO GOING TO GIVE HER A LITTLE BIT UNDERNEATH SO GO AHEAD AND LOOK UP
GL8jnO4CT_c_9 0 AND THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO SURROUND THE EYE WITH COLOR SO HER EYE REALLY STANDS OUT AND YOU CAN KIND SMUDGE IT OUT AND CREATE A SOFT SMOKEY EFFECT IF YOU WANT TO
GL8jnO4CT_c_10 0 OR JUST SOMETHING RIGHT ON THE LASH LINE
GL8jnO4CT_c_11 0 AND JUST KEEP BLENDING IT UNTIL YOU GET THE CONSISTENCY THAT YOU WANT AND THE SMOOTHNESS OF THE COLOR
GL8jnO4CT_c_12 0 THAT'S REALLY PRETTY
h7ffVNNtEsA_1 0 SO IT'S TIME TO DISCUSS THE DRAW IN CALIFORNIA LO-BALL
h7ffVNNtEsA_2 0 I WANT YOU TO PLEASE LOOK AT THIS HAND
h7ffVNNtEsA_3 0 I'VE LAID IT OUT FROM THE LOWEST CARD TO THE HIGHEST SO ACE IS PLAYED LOW HERE SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO DECIDE WHAT CARD YOU WANT TO GET RID OF
h7ffVNNtEsA_4 0 WELL AN EIGHT- LOW CAN WIN SO I SAY KEEP THE EIGHT AND THROW AWAY THE KING SO YOU'RE GOING TO ASK FOR ONE CARD SO WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE
h7ffVNNtEsA_5 0 THIS PERSON IS GOING TO ASK FOR THREE
h7ffVNNtEsA_6 0 I GIVE THEM THREE CARDS
h7ffVNNtEsA_7 0 YOU'RE ASKING FOR ONE ONE CARD FOR YOU
h7ffVNNtEsA_8 0 THIS PLAYER SAYS EW YUCK BUT I'LL ASK FOR TWO SO TWO CARDS TO HIM AND THEN WHAT DO I WANT
h7ffVNNtEsA_9 0 I WANT A WHOLE NEW HAND BUT I'LL GO AHEAD AND TAKE THREE CARDS ONE TWO THREE AND THAT'S THAT
h7ffVNNtEsA_10 0 THAT'S THE DRAW PORTION OF CALIFORNIA LOW-BALL AND WE WILL DISCUSS THE REST IN THE NEXT SEGMENT
Gw8PFSzolmg_1 0 NOW THAT THE COAT OF BASE PAINT THAT I'VE PUT ON HAS DRIED I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND COLOR THE PICTURE FRAME WITH MY YELLOW ACRYLIC PAINT
Gw8PFSzolmg_2 0 NOW I'M NOT SO WORRIED ABOUT THE TEXTURE UNDERNEATH OF THE MASKING TAPE AND THE WHITE BASE PAINT WHICH ALSO WENT ON KIND OF THICK BECAUSE THE TEXTURE IS KIND OF A I KIND OF LIKE HAVING A THE LITTLE BIT OF TEXTURE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PICTURE FRAME
Gw8PFSzolmg_3 0 IT MAKES IT LOOK A LITTLE BIT NICER AND SO I DON'T MIND THAT EFFECT
Gw8PFSzolmg_4 0 NOW WHEN I USE THE PAINT I'M GOING TO BE USING A SOLID COLOR BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE DECORATING IT WITH A LOT OF BEADS AND I DON'T WANT IT TO BE TOO LOOK TOO KIND OF BUSY SO TO SPEAK
Gw8PFSzolmg_5 0 NOW THIS STEP IS GOING TO NEED TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME AFTER IT'S DONE
Gw8PFSzolmg_6 0 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT THE PICTURE FRAME ASIDE AND LET IT DRY SO IN PLANNING YOUR PROJECT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING A DIFFERENT TYPE OF DECORATION I'M GOING TO BE USING BEADS AND THAT'S REALLY THE LAST THING THAT WE NEED TO DO HERE SO THE BEADS DON'T REALLY NEED TOO MUCH PREPARATION BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING DIFFERENT TYPES OF COLORS OR NEED TO CUT OUT SHAPES OR WHATEVER OTHER TYPE OF DECORATIONS YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO PREPARE IT WHILE THE PICTURE FRAME IS DRYING
Gw8PFSzolmg_7 0 NOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO GO AROUND THE SIDES TOO WHERE WE PUT THE MASKING TAPE
Gw8PFSzolmg_8 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK OBVIOUSLY BUT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY PUT A LAYER OF PAINT ALONG THE OUTER EDGES WHICH ARE WHICH WERE COVERED WITH MASKING TAPE
Gw8PFSzolmg_9 0 SO COVER THE OUTER EDGES COVER THE SURFACE OF THE PICTURE FRAME AND ONCE IT'S DONE WE'LL PUT IT ASIDE AND WE'LL LET IT DRY AND THEN WE'LL BE READY TO GLUE OUR BEADS ON TO THE PICTURE FRAME
Gw8PFSzolmg_10 0 SO NOW I'VE SHOWN YOU HOW TO PAINT THE OUTSIDE OF THE PICTURE FRAME
G4p6QqGMUkA_1 0 WORKING ON PAM'S LOWER BACK
G4p6QqGMUkA_2 0 SHE HAS VERY TRANSLUCENT HAIR
G4p6QqGMUkA_3 0 SHE WANTS TO BE TOTALLY HAIRLESS
G4p6QqGMUkA_4 0 SO I'M GOING TO GET THAT LIGHT THAT'S GOING TO COME IN FROM THIS DIRECTION UNDERNEATH THE HAIR AND I'M GOING TO HAVE LIGHT COMING THIS WAY
G4p6QqGMUkA_5 0 I WORK WITH HALOGEN LIGHTS
G4p6QqGMUkA_6 0 SO I'VE GOT TO REALLY FOCUS DOWN WITH THE LIGHT
G4p6QqGMUkA_7 0 AND THERE IS A PRODUCT THAT I USUALLY PUT ON THAT MAKES THOSE HAIRS
G4p6QqGMUkA_8 0 IT'S CALLED PORE MARKER
G4p6QqGMUkA_9 0 AND I'LL PUT THAT ON
G4p6QqGMUkA_10 0 I DIDN'T BRING IT WITH ME TODAY
G4p6QqGMUkA_11 0 BUT I'M JUST GIVING YOU SAMPLES OF HOW TO DO THIS WORK
G4p6QqGMUkA_12 0 BUT THAT PORE MARKER WILL DARKEN THIS AREA AND THEN IT'LL SHOW THE PORES UP JUST THE WAY IT'LL AND IT MARKS THE HAIR AS WELL
G4p6QqGMUkA_13 0 AND IT'LL SHOW WHERE I NEED TO BE AS FAR AS DOING THIS AREA
G4p6QqGMUkA_14 0 AND BUT WITH HER I CAN SEE WITH THE WAY THIS LIGHTING IS
G4p6QqGMUkA_15 0 I CAN SEE JUST WHERE I NEED TO GO
G4p6QqGMUkA_16 0 AND I'M GOING TO SLIDE THAT HAIR I'M GOING TO SLIDE THAT PROBE RIGHT INTO THE HAIR FOLLICLE
G4p6QqGMUkA_17 0 ONE AT A TIME AND THEN TREAT IT
G4p6QqGMUkA_18 0 AND I KNOW HOW DEEP THESE HAIRS ARE
G4p6QqGMUkA_19 0 I'VE ALREADY YOU KNOW DID THE TEST OF MEASURING THEM
G4p6QqGMUkA_20 0 AND THEN I'M JUST GOING TO KEEP GOING
G4p6QqGMUkA_21 0 I'M GOING TO TREAT AND TREAT AND TREAT
G4p6QqGMUkA_22 0 AND SHE WANTS TO DO AN HOUR ON HER BACK
G4p6QqGMUkA_23 0 SO WHEN IT COMES TO THAT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO TREAT THIRTY MINUTES HERE AND THEN I'M GOING TO TREAT THIRTY MINUTES HERE
G4p6QqGMUkA_24 0 USUALLY THIS IS KIND OF LIKE A CLOCK AS WELL
G4p6QqGMUkA_25 0 THE HAIRS WILL COME HERE AND THEN GROW UP AND THEN GROW THIS WAY
G4p6QqGMUkA_26 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE COMING IN LIKE SO AROUND
G4p6QqGMUkA_27 0 BUT WHEN IT COMES TO A REAL HAIRY BACK THE SAME THING AS I SPOKE OF BEFORE
G4p6QqGMUkA_28 0 I'LL ASSESS IT AND THEN I'LL DO RECOMMENDATIONS WITH THE CLIENT
h0HsjGpBr8s_2 0 MY NAME'S YOLANDA VANVEEN AND IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO LEARN ALL ABOUT HOW TO BECOME A MASTER GARDENER
h0HsjGpBr8s_3 0 I BECAME A MASTER GARDENER IN 2004 AND IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING AND ENTERTAINING AND ALSO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT I THINK I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED
h0HsjGpBr8s_4 0 AND NOT ONLY WAS IT FUN TO LEARN ABOUT THE PLANTS I LEARNED SO MUCH MORE
h0HsjGpBr8s_5 0 I LEARNED ALL ABOUT BUGS AND TREES AND SOILS AND TRANSPLANTING AND IT WAS JUST REALLY A REALLY EXCITING EXPERIENCE
h0HsjGpBr8s_6 0 NOW HOW DO YOU BECOME A MASTER GARDENER
h0HsjGpBr8s_7 0 PEOPLE ASK ME ALL THE TIME
h0HsjGpBr8s_8 0 AND IT'S REALLY EASY
h0HsjGpBr8s_9 0 SO I ATTENDED A GARDEN SHOW AND THERE WERE SOME MASTER GARDENERS AND THEY WERE AT A BOOTH AND THEY HAD SOME FLIERS ON HOW TO BECOME A MASTER GARDENER
h0HsjGpBr8s_10 0 SO THE MASTER GARDENING PROGRAM IS SPONSORED BY YOUR LOCAL STATE EXTENSION SERVICE
h0HsjGpBr8s_11 0 SO THE WASHINGTON STATE PROGRAM IS RUN THROUGH THE WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY COOPERATIVE EXTENSION
h0HsjGpBr8s_12 0 AND SO THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OR YOU CAN GO TO THE LOCAL STATE UNIVERSITY AND ASK AROUND OR JUST GOOGLE YOUR COUNTY AND MASTER GARDENERS AND USUALLY THE INFORMATION WILL COME RIGHT UP
h0HsjGpBr8s_13 0 THE PROGRAMS ARE USUALLY HELD ONCE A YEAR OR ONCE EVERY TWO YEARS
h0HsjGpBr8s_14 0 AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE OF A TIME COMMITMENT BUT IT REALLY WASN'T THAT BAD
h0HsjGpBr8s_15 0 IT WAS JUST ONCE A WEEK ONE DAY
h0HsjGpBr8s_16 0 MY PROGRAM WAS ON THURSDAYS
h0HsjGpBr8s_17 0 SOME ARE ON SATURDAYS
h0HsjGpBr8s_18 0 AND YOU'RE IN CLASSES JUST LIKE GOING TO COLLEGE FROM ABOUT NINE TO THREE OR FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON
h0HsjGpBr8s_19 0 AND EACH DAY YOU LEARN ALL DIFFERENT SUBJECTS
h0HsjGpBr8s_20 0 AND YOU'RE ON A SET SCHEDULE AND YOU HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE COME AND SPEAK TO YOU AND IT'S VERY VERY INTERESTING
h0HsjGpBr8s_21 0 THE CLASSES WERE FOR ONLY ABOUT TWO TO THREE MONTHS SO IT REALLY WASN'T A LOT OF CLASSES IN THE END
h0HsjGpBr8s_22 0 THEN ONCE YOU'VE FINISHED YOUR CLASSES YOU GET CERTIFIED AND THEN YOU CAN REPRESENT THE WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY MASTER GARDENING PROGRAM AT DIFFERENT FARMER'S MARKETS AND IN THE EXTENSION SERVICE OFFICES
h0HsjGpBr8s_23 0 SO THE MAIN REASON THAT THEY STARTED THE WHOLE PROGRAM IN WASHINGTON STATE WAS SO THAT THE EXTENSION SERVICE THE DEPARTMENT OF AG COULD HAVE HELP BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE CALL IN WITH GARDENING QUESTIONS
h0HsjGpBr8s_24 0 AND SO THEY SET UP THE MASTER GARDENING PROGRAM SO THAT PEOPLE CAN VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME AND HELP OTHERS
h0HsjGpBr8s_25 0 AND IT WORKS OUT FOR EVERYONE
h0HsjGpBr8s_26 0 THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT I LEARNED WAS HOW TO RESEARCH INFORMATION CAUSE THERE'S REALLY NO RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWERS WHEN THERE COMES WHEN THERE'S GARDENING QUESTIONS
h0HsjGpBr8s_27 0 AND PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES
h0HsjGpBr8s_28 0 AND SO THERE IS A SET MANUAL THAT THEY PROVIDE FOR YOU THAT I REFER TO ALL THE TIME
h0HsjGpBr8s_29 0 AND IN THE PROGRAM IT'S JUST LIKE COLLEGE
h0HsjGpBr8s_30 0 AND YOU JUST GO THROUGH EACH OF THE SUBJECTS
h0HsjGpBr8s_31 0 IT'S LIKE A MINI HORTICULTURAL DEGREE
h0HsjGpBr8s_32 0 AND BOTANY BASICS SOILS AND FERTILIZERS PLANT PROPAGATION PRUNING WHICH I REALLY REFER TO
h0HsjGpBr8s_33 0 AND ALL TYPES OF OTHER INFORMATION
h0HsjGpBr8s_34 0 HOW TO PLANT BULBS
h0HsjGpBr8s_35 0 HOW TO TAKE CARE OF BERRIES BUGS ETYMOLOGY WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON BUGS BECAUSE THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF GARDENING IS TO UNDERSTANDING HOW TO DEAL WITH THE WILDLIFE AROUND YOU
h0HsjGpBr8s_36 0 IT'S MUCH EASIER THAN COLLEGE TOO
h0HsjGpBr8s_37 0 I WAS REALLY THRILLED TO FIND OUT THERE'S NO TESTS IN CLASS
h0HsjGpBr8s_38 0 YOU JUST TAKE YOUR MANUAL HOME AND YOU HAVE A LIST OF QUESTIONS EACH WEEK AND YOU CAN REFER TO YOUR BOOK CAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE LEARNING
h0HsjGpBr8s_39 0 YOU'RE LEARNING HOW TO DO RESEARCH WHICH I REALLY THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF LEARNING IS LEARNING FROM OTHERS
h0HsjGpBr8s_40 0 AND SO YOU JUST WRITE EXACTLY WHERE YOU GOT YOUR REFERENCE AND WHAT YOUR ANSWER IS AND THEN YOU TURN YOUR PAPER WORK IN AND THEN THEY GIVE IT BACK TO YA
h0HsjGpBr8s_41 0 AND THE BEST PART IS IS WHEN YOU GET A SMILEY FACE FOR GETTING ALL OF THE QUESTIONS RIGHT
h0HsjGpBr8s_42 0 ONCE YOU GRADUATE FROM THE MASTER GARDENER DEGREE PROGRAM THEN YOU NEED TO PUT IN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS IN VOLUNTEERING
h0HsjGpBr8s_43 0 SO YOU CAN VOLUNTEER AT THE CLINIC OR TEACHING OTHERS ABOUT GARDENING OR IN THE LOCAL SCHOOLS OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO
h0HsjGpBr8s_44 0 THEY HAVE ALL TYPES OF PROGRAMS
h0HsjGpBr8s_45 0 AND ONCE YOU HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS THEN YOU GET YOUR BADGE
h0HsjGpBr8s_46 0 TO KEEP YOUR BADGE AND TO REPRESENT THE MASTER GARDENERS YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP YOUR VOLUNTEER TIME AND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT'S HARD
h0HsjGpBr8s_47 0 BUT IT IS SO REWARDING TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE HELPING OTHERS AND IT IS A REALLY GOOD USE OF YOUR TIME
h0HsjGpBr8s_48 0 AND IT'S GREAT TO KNOW ABOUT GARDENING AND TO SHARE IT WITH OTHERS
GLZZNuv8aos_1 0 LET'S DISCUSS HOW TO CHECK THE GUMS ON YOUR DOG OR CAT
GLZZNuv8aos_2 0 THE FIRST THING TO KNOW ABOUT CHECKING GUMS IS TO KEEP OUT OF HARM'S WAY
GLZZNuv8aos_3 0 A LOT OF CATS ESPECIALLY DON'T APPRECIATE LOOKING AT THEIR GUMS
GLZZNuv8aos_4 0 AND SO JUST BE CAREFUL
GLZZNuv8aos_5 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO GET BIT
GLZZNuv8aos_6 0 THE NEXT THING YOU'RE LOOKING FOR REALLY IS GUM COLOR
GLZZNuv8aos_7 0 YOU CAN LIFT THE GUMS UP THE LIPS UP TOP OVER THE GUMS AND YOU CAN SEE THE NICE PINK COLOR AND THAT IS NORMAL
GLZZNuv8aos_8 0 YOU CAN ALSO PRESS INTO A PINK PORTION AND SEE HOW IT WHITES OUT AND REFILLS ITS COLOR
GLZZNuv8aos_9 0 THE NEXT THING YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR ARE WHAT THE TEETH LOOK LIKE
GLZZNuv8aos_10 0 ZOE'S LOOKS REALLY GOOD
GLZZNuv8aos_11 0 NO TARTAR BUILD UP REALLY
GLZZNuv8aos_12 0 ALSO WE'RE LOOKING FOR GINGIVITIS WHICH IS SWOLLEN AND RED GUMS
GLZZNuv8aos_13 0 VERY COMMON ON OLDER PETS THAT ARE EATING CANNED FOODS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
GLZZNuv8aos_14 0 BUT JUST STAY OUT OF HARM'S WAY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
GUpnR4Flyw0_1 0 WE'RE HERE PICKING OUT OUR COLORS OF GLASS AND OUR TEXTURES OF GLASS TODAY FOR ONE OF OUR ART PROJECTS
GUpnR4Flyw0_2 0 AND I WANTED TO HELP TO SHOW YOU SOME OF THE DIFFERENT CHOICES YOU HAVE AVAILABLE
GUpnR4Flyw0_3 0 RIGHT NOW I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF GLASS THAT SEEM VERY SIMILAR
GUpnR4Flyw0_4 0 BUT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TELL THEM
GUpnR4Flyw0_5 0 BECAUSE THEY'RE NAME IS DIFFERENT
GUpnR4Flyw0_6 0 THE FIRST ONE WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT TODAY IS ARTIQUE GLASS
GUpnR4Flyw0_7 0 THIS ARTIQUE GLASS IS A COBALT BLUE
GUpnR4Flyw0_8 0 AND IF YOU NOTICE YOU CAN SEE THIS TEXTURE IT'S KIND OF A DEEPLY RECESSED
GUpnR4Flyw0_9 0 KIND OF A SCRAPING LINE EFFECT IN THE GLASS
GUpnR4Flyw0_10 0 THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING AGAIN THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR SAY YOUR FLOWER PETALS OR A WATER OR SKY SCENE
GUpnR4Flyw0_11 0 SO THIS IS YOUR ARTIQUE
GUpnR4Flyw0_12 0 NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH ANTIQUE
GUpnR4Flyw0_13 0 IT'S A-R-T-I-Q-U-E AND THEN HERE WE HAVE GNA
GUpnR4Flyw0_14 0 AND IT'S SOMEWHAT SIMILAR
GUpnR4Flyw0_15 0 BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE LINES IN IT
GUpnR4Flyw0_16 0 BUT IT'S NOT AS DEEPLY RECESSED ON HERE
GUpnR4Flyw0_17 0 IT'S JUST KIND OF LIKE A LIKE IF YOU WERE TO HAVE TAKEN A PIECE OF WIRE WHILE THE GLASS WAS VERY HOT AND JUST FLOWED IT THROUGH THE GLASS TO GET THAT TEXTURE
GUpnR4Flyw0_18 0 SO THIS IS YOUR GNA
GUpnR4Flyw0_19 0 AND THIS IS YOUR ARTIQUE
GVU_CndU8qU_1 0 HI I'M MELINA AND WELCOME TO EXPERT VILLAGE
GVU_CndU8qU_2 0 TODAY WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A POLYMER CLAY BOWL
GVU_CndU8qU_3 0 IN THIS NEXT STEP WE ARE GOING TO CREATE THE OUTER PETALS OF OUR FLOWER FOR THE POLYMER CLAY BASE
GVU_CndU8qU_4 0 SO WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A COLOR AND IT CAN BE ANY COLOR YOU WANT BUT YOU NEED TO HAVE ENOUGH TO MAKE SIMILAR LOGS ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AND YOU NEED TO MAKE ABOUT FIVE
GVU_CndU8qU_5 0 ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE
GVU_CndU8qU_7 0 OKAY WE'RE GOING TO ROLL EACH ONE OF THESE INTO INDIVIDUAL LOGS AND WE'RE GOING TO ATTACH THEM TO OUR CENTER LOG
GVU_CndU8qU_8 0 YOU CAN SEE HOW IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A FLOWER
GVU_CndU8qU_9 0 IT WILL LOOK MORE LIKE A FLOWER WHEN IT'S ALL COMPLETE AND ROLLED
GVU_CndU8qU_10 0 SO WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A COLOR THAT IS VERY CONTRASTING FROM THIS PURPLE
GVU_CndU8qU_11 0 YOU DON'T WANT USE SOMETHING THAT'S ALMOST LIKE THE PURPLE BECAUSE YOU REALLY WANT AT PETALS TO STICK OUT AND SHOW
GVU_CndU8qU_12 0 SO I'M GOING TO USE THIS BRIGHT YELLOW RIGHT HERE
GVU_CndU8qU_13 0 WE'RE GOING TO ROLL IT OUT AND WE'RE GOING TO CUT IT INTO SIX SLICES THE LAST SIXTH SLICE BEING BIGGER THAN THE REST
GVU_CndU8qU_14 0 TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX PERFECT
GVU_CndU8qU_15 0 THREE FOUR FIVE AND THEN THIS IS OUR SIXTH ONE
GVU_CndU8qU_16 0 SO BASICALLY WHAT WE ARE DOING IS WE ARE CREATING A COLOR THAT'S GOING TO GO IN BETWEEN THE PETALS
GVU_CndU8qU_17 0 SAYING THIS IS A PETAL AND THIS IS A PETAL IN BETWEEN THAT THERE IS A TRIANGLE SHAPE
GVU_CndU8qU_18 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS GOING TO ROLL OUT ROLL OUT A LOG IT'S ABOUT THE SAME LENGTH AND YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE YOUR TWO FINGERS AND YOU ARE GOING TO SMUSH THE TOP INTO A TRIANGLE SHAPE
gTeJZqCkxds_1 0 DARREN STORR HI MY NAME IS DARREN STORR ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gTeJZqCkxds_2 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO RUN A 400-METER SPRINT
gTeJZqCkxds_3 0 ONCE YOU'RE ON THE HOMESTRETCH IT'S ALL ABOUT GUTS
gTeJZqCkxds_4 0 THE 400 METERS IS THE MOST GUTSIEST RACE IN TRACK AND FIELD
gTeJZqCkxds_5 0 SO ONCE YOU CAN MAINTAIN FOR 300 METERS AND YOU COME OFF THE CURB INTO 100 METERS YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO RUN RELAXED WHICH I MEAN WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS RUNNING RELAXED HELPS YOU RUN FASTER
gTeJZqCkxds_6 0 THE MORE YOU RUN RELAXED THE MORE YOU CAN RUN FASTER
gTeJZqCkxds_7 0 AND LIKE I SAID THIS PLACE HAS PSYCHOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE OVER MOST RUNNERS BECAUSE THE HOMESTRETCH IS WHERE MOST RUNNERS OR MOST ATHLETES BREAK DOWN START TO GET TIGHTENED UP THEIR MUSCLES STARTS CRAMPING SO IF YOU CAN MAINTAIN ON THE HOMESTRETCH YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH RUN A GOOD RACE
GLGjRo02g90_1 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE NOW ARE SOME SCRUNCHIES USING A DOUBLE CROCHET
GLGjRo02g90_2 0 AND HERE I HAVE TWO EXAMPLES
GLGjRo02g90_3 0 THIS IS ONE WHERE WE REALLY JUST COVER UP OUR RUBBER BAND AND IT'S JUST A BASIC RUBBER BAND LIKE THIS
GLGjRo02g90_4 0 AND JUST TO COVER IT UP TO COVER UP THE RUBBER BAND JUST TO GIVE IT SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND TO ADD JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE BODY TO IT WHEN YOU WRAP IT AROUND YOUR HAIR
GLGjRo02g90_5 0 THIS ONE IS MORE FAMILIAR TO A REGULAR SCRUNCHY THAT YOU WOULD FIND IN A STORE BECAUSE IT'S GOT THE SCRUNCHED UP YARN LIKE THIS
GLGjRo02g90_6 0 WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING THESE YOU CAN SCRUNCH THEM UP AS LITTLE OR AS MUCH AS YOU WANT AND YOU CAN MAKE THEM AS BIG AS YOU WANT
GLGjRo02g90_7 0 YOU'LL SEE LATER THAT WE'RE GOING TO ADD MORE TO THESE
GLGjRo02g90_8 0 NOW WHEN YOU'RE USING THESE RUBBER BANDS YOU CAN USE WHATEVER WIDTH YOU LIKE
GLGjRo02g90_9 0 I DON'T RECOMMEND THESE SO MUCH A THICKER ONE IS BETTER
GLGjRo02g90_10 0 AND YOU WANT TO USE A SMALLER GAGE YARN NOTHING TOO HEAVY BECAUSE YOU REALLY WANT TO GET A NICE COVER ALL THE WAY THE RUBBER BAND
GLGjRo02g90_11 0 AND SINCE YOU'RE USING A SMALLER YARN USE A SMALLER NEEDLE AND YOU'LL ALSO NEED SOME SCISSORS
GLGjRo02g90_12 0 AND THEN ONCE YOU COMPLETE YOUR PROJECT YOU'LL NEED A LIGHTER TO HELP MELT YOUR YARN
GLGjRo02g90_13 0 AND WE CAN GET STARTED
haXymkOUJoM_1 0 HI I'M JEREMY FROM F H STEINBART COMPANY AND TODAY WE WILL BE DOING A BEER BREWING TUTORIAL ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
haXymkOUJoM_2 0 IN THIS CLIP WE WILL BE TRANSFERRING FROM OUR PRIMARY FERMENTER HERE INTO OUR SECONDARY GLASS FERMENTER
haXymkOUJoM_3 0 I'M GOING TO POUR ABOUT A QUART OR SO OF SANITIZER SOLUTION AND VERY GENTLY SWIRL THIS SOLUTION AROUND INSIDE THE CARBOY MAKING SURE THAT IT TOUCHES ALL SURFACES ON THE INSIDE GENTLY POUR IT ON BACK INTO THE BUCKET
haXymkOUJoM_4 0 NEXT COMES THE SANITIZER RACKING CANE
haXymkOUJoM_5 0 WHAT I'M DOING HERE IS COILING THE END OF THIS SIPHIN CANE DOWN INTO OUR BUCKET HERE ALLOWING THE SOFT TUBING TO FILL WITH SANITIZER
haXymkOUJoM_6 0 I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PLUG THE END OF THAT TUBING WITH MY THUMB AND REMOVE THIS WHOLE THING PLACE OUR RACKING CANE DOWN INTO OUR BEER TAKE YOUR GLASS AND GO AHEAD AND LOWER IT TOWARDS THE FLOOR AND NOTICE THAT I STILL HAVE MY RACKING CANE FULL OF SANITIZER HERE AND MY THUMB IS THE ONLY THING HOLDING THIS SANITIZER INSIDE THE RACKING CANE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT
haXymkOUJoM_7 0 WE ARE GOING TO USE THAT SANITIZER TO START OUR SIPHON
haXymkOUJoM_8 0 WHAT WE JUST DID HERE WAS SENT SOME OF THAT SANITIZER AND ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF BEER OFF INTO OUR GLASS HERE AND QUICKLY PLUG THAT SIPHON ONCE IT HAD FILLED WITH BEER AND IT WAS PRIMED MOVED THE TUBE OVER TO OUR GLASS CARBOY AND NOW WE ARE TRANSFERRING
haXymkOUJoM_9 0 AS YOU CAN SEE IN THIS TOP BUCKET WE'VE GOT ALL OF OUR BEER COMING DOWN INTO OUR GLASS JUG
haXymkOUJoM_10 0 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE TOP OF OUR GLASS CONTAINER IS BELOW THE BOTTOM OF THIS CONTAINER
haXymkOUJoM_11 0 NOW WE HAVE ALL OF OUR BEER TRANSFERRED FROM OUR PRIMARY FERMENTER INTO THE SECONDARY FERMENTER
haXymkOUJoM_12 0 AS YOU CAN SEE WE LEFT A LOT OF SLUDGE BEHIND HERE THAT'S GOOD AND IF YOU HAVE TO LEAVE A LITTLE BIT OF BEER IN THERE THAT'S O'KAY
haXymkOUJoM_13 0 LIKE I SAID EARLIER THIS IS PART OF THE CLEARING PROCESS AND AS YOU CAN SEE OUR BEER IS STILL A LITTLE BIT HAZY SO WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SET THAT ASIDE WITH A SANITIZED AIR LOCK AND STOPPER FITTED IN THE TOP OF THIS AND LET THAT SET UNTIL IT CLEARS
haXymkOUJoM_14 0 TYPICALLY IT TAKES ABOUT TWO WEEKS AND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR WHEN YOU COME BACK TO THIS BEER IS GOING TO BE A NICE SEDIMENTATION LAYER ON THE BOTTOM AND CLEAR BEER ABOVE THAT
H1UFczWdtKU_1 0 AW ITS REALLY COMING TOGETHER NOW
H1UFczWdtKU_2 0 NOW HERE COMES MY FAVORITE PARTS THE A FRAMES
H1UFczWdtKU_3 0 A FOR FRAME
H1UFczWdtKU_4 0 COME DOWN HERE LET ME SHOW YOU THIS
H1UFczWdtKU_5 0 HERE IS YOUR BOTTOM OR YOUR FRAME ACTUALLY YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IT IN GOOD SHAPE
H1UFczWdtKU_6 0 THE BIGGEST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH FRAMES IS THAT THIS PART BREAKS IF IT BREAKS THEN WELL THEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE TENSION THE FLAP WONT HOLD IN PLACE AND THE WHOLE THING JUST WONT OPERATE PROPERLY
H1UFczWdtKU_7 0 SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FRAME IS IN GOOD SHAPE
H1UFczWdtKU_8 0 IF NOT GO FOR A NEW FRAME
H1UFczWdtKU_10 0 NOW THE A FRAMES THEY GO IN PRETTY

H1UFczWdtKU_13 0 ITS NOT RACKET SCIENCE BUT IT IS A LOT OF FUN AND IT IS MOSTLY ABOUT SEQUENCE
H1UFczWdtKU_14 0 SO WERE GOING TO PUT THIS OVER HERE
H1UFczWdtKU_15 0 THIS IS THE BOTTOM BUSHING
H1UFczWdtKU_16 0 TURQUOISE DON'T KNOW WHY
H1UFczWdtKU_18 0 LETS PUT IT IN LETS PUT IT IN
H1UFczWdtKU_19 0 IT JUST SITS RIGHT IN THERE
H1UFczWdtKU_20 0 DID YOU SEE THAT
H1UFczWdtKU_23 0 NOW ALRIGHT PUTS IN RIGHT IN THERE GRAVITY HOLDS IT IN PLACE FOR NOW
H1UFczWdtKU_24 0 AND NOW WERE GOING TO PUT IN THE A FRAMES
H1UFczWdtKU_25 0 ALRIGHT THESE GUYS HERE AGAIN THESE ARE LOOSE BEARINGS UNLIKE OUR TURBINE BEARINGS IN OTHER MODELS THAT HAYWARD MAKES AS POOL CLEANERS IT DOES NOT HAVE BEARING SEPARATORS
H1UFczWdtKU_26 0 THEY SHOULD BE LOOSE BEARINGS LIKE THIS AND ALL THATS GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT THIS PART IS GOING TO GO INWARD IN ORDER TO SEAT INTO THE BUSHING AND THEN THIS PART IS GOING TO GO OUTWARD
H1UFczWdtKU_27 0 AND THEN IT GOES JUST LIKE THIS
H1UFczWdtKU_30 0 DID YOU SEE THAT
H1UFczWdtKU_32 0 LETS DO IT AGAIN
H1UFczWdtKU_33 0 IN AND SEATS JUST LIKE THAT
H1UFczWdtKU_34 0 NOW IT LOOKS SLOPPY BUT THATS OK
H1UFczWdtKU_35 0 THESE HERE ARE THE BUSHINGS FOR THE OUTSIDE
H1UFczWdtKU_36 0 NOW ITS VERY DIFFICULT TO TELL BUT THEY ARE A LITTLE FLAT ON ONE SIDE YOU WILL SEE THAT THEY ARE FLAT ON ONE SIDE INSIDE OF HERE
H1UFczWdtKU_37 0 SO I JUST PUSH IT AND SPIN IT UNTIL IT GIVES
H1UFczWdtKU_38 0 THERE YOU GO AND MAKE IT NICE AND EVEN
H1UFczWdtKU_39 0 THERE IS A BUMP TO HOLD DOWN THE OUTSIDE BUT IT SHOULD BE FLUSH
H1UFczWdtKU_40 0 SAME THING WITH THE OTHER SIDE HERE
H1UFczWdtKU_41 0 I AM GOING TO SPIN PUSH AND FLUSH
H1UFczWdtKU_42 0 AND NOW TO MAKE THE PLACE AND TIGHTEN EVERYTHING UP JUST A LITTLE BIT
H1UFczWdtKU_43 0 HERE IS THE TOP OF THE BUSHING ASSEMBLY AND OF COURSE OUR SET SCREW WITH LOCK WASHER
H1UFczWdtKU_44 0 PUT THEM IN THERE SO ITS ALL SET
H1UFczWdtKU_45 0 NOW YOUR ALSO GOING TO SEE A COPPER RECESSED IN THERE
H1UFczWdtKU_46 0 JUST SET THE SCREW HOME AND I AM JUST GOING TO PLACE IT THERE
H1UFczWdtKU_47 0 I CAN FEEL ITS JUST STARTED A LITTLE BIT
H1UFczWdtKU_48 0 ACTUALLY I AM NOT EVEN GOING TO USE THE OTHER ONE
H1UFczWdtKU_49 0 I AM GOING TO GO OLD SCHOOL HERE WITH THE HAND HELD TOOL BECAUSE ITS ONLY A FEW TURNS
H1UFczWdtKU_50 0 NOT TO WAIST YOUR TIME HERE
H1UFczWdtKU_52 0 NOW THE A FRAMES THERE READY TO DO THEIR JOB
gXfZEG-uMOA_1 0 WE'RE DOING SOME POTTING OF MEXICAN HONEYSUCKLE
gXfZEG-uMOA_2 0 IT'S NATIVE TO TEXAS EASY TO GROW FROM ROOT CUTTINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
gXfZEG-uMOA_3 0 BUT YOU GOT TO HAVE SOIL SO WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT POTTING SOILS IN GENERAL THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT KINDS THAT I HAVE
gXfZEG-uMOA_4 0 I HAVE ONE THAT IS CALLED A PREMIUM GRADE WHICH HAS NO SOIL IN IT IT HAS NO ACTUAL DIRT IT HAS PEAT MOSS AND IT HAS ORGANIC MATTER COMPOSTED PLANTS
gXfZEG-uMOA_5 0 THIS IS NOT THE FINEST GRADE BUT IT'S WHAT I USE AND I CALL IT A PREMIUM GRADE
gXfZEG-uMOA_6 0 THERE IS A CHEAPER VARIETY WHICH HAS A LOT OF DIRT IN IT IT HAS A QUITE A BIT OF ORGANIC MATTER AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT IT WORKS PRETTY WELL
gXfZEG-uMOA_7 0 THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM IS THAT THE HIGH ORGANIC OR THE NO SOIL IS A LOT LIGHTER WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT POT PLANTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE AROUND OR PLANTS THAT ARE IN FLATS THAT YOU MAY BE SELLING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
gXfZEG-uMOA_8 0 IN HOUSE PLANTS THEY GET MOVED INTO AREAS THAT GET THE RIGHT SUNLIGHT OR GET THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE MORE QUICKLY MOVED IN IF THERE IS A FROST COMING AND MORE LIKELY THEY WOULD BE MOVED INTO A SUNNY WINDOW IF THEY NEEDED
gXfZEG-uMOA_9 0 THE POTTING SOIL WITH DIRT IN IT GETS HEAVY AND THEREFORE IT MIGHT NOT BE AS EASY TO MOVE IT AROUND THEREFORE THE PLANTS MAY NOT GET THE BEST OF CARE
gbvMqFhBqSU_1 0 HI MY NAME IS NATE MCCULLOUGH ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gbvMqFhBqSU_2 0 IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CORRECT PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZE VEHICLE
gbvMqFhBqSU_3 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT INSURING YOU HAVE THE CORRECT CONTROL ARM AND ALIGNMENT OF YOUR MOUNTING BOLTS
gbvMqFhBqSU_4 0 THE CONTROL ARMS ARE A RIGHT AND A LEFT THEY ARE NOT IDENTICAL
gbvMqFhBqSU_5 0 THEY ARE NOT ASYMMETRICAL AS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT HERE NEXT TO THE BALL JOINT GREASE BOOT THERE IS AN L
gbvMqFhBqSU_6 0 THAT INDICATES THAT THIS IS ONLY FOR THE DRIVER S SIDE OF THE VEHICLE
gbvMqFhBqSU_7 0 HOW YOU DETERMINE WHICH SIDE OF THE VEHICLE IT IS YOU PICTURE YOURSELF SITTING BEHIND THE STEERING WHEEL YOUR LEFT HAND IS GOING TO INDICATE THE LEFT SIDE AND YOUR RIGHT HAND IS GOING TO INDICATE THE RIGHT SIDE
gbvMqFhBqSU_8 0 WE ARE ON THE DRIVER S SIDE FRONT GOT THE LEFT ONE INDICATED HERE ON THE CASTING OF THE CONTROL ARM AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE AND SET OUR CONTROL ARM UP INTO PLACE
gbvMqFhBqSU_9 0 PREVIOUSLY IN ANOTHER CLIP WE INDEXED OUR CAM ADJUSTERS
gbvMqFhBqSU_10 0 YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO ENSURE THAT YOU PUT YOUR CAM ADJUSTER BACK WHERE YOU GOT IT FROM
gbvMqFhBqSU_11 0 JUST GIVEN THE DISCREPANCY AND THE WAY YOU HAVE THEM MARKED
gbvMqFhBqSU_12 0 I MARK MINE ALWAYS IN THE EXACTLY SAME SPOT SO I CAN MIX THEM AROUND
gbvMqFhBqSU_13 0 BUT JUST PER CHANCE IF YOU MARKED ONE AT TWELVE O'CLOCK AND MARK THE OTHER ONE AT THREE O'CLOCK YOUR NOT GOING TO WANT TO ALIGN THE WRONG INDEX POINT WITH THE WRONG CAM BOLT
gbvMqFhBqSU_14 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS TAKE AND SLIP RIGHT BACK IN HERE AND INSTALL OUR CAMBER BOLT
gbvMqFhBqSU_15 0 IT'LL TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF FIDDLING TO GET ALL THE PROPER STUFF TO LINE UP
gbvMqFhBqSU_16 0 ALRIGHT ONCE YOU HAVE THE BOLT STARTED AND THROUGH YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND PUT YOUR RETAINING NUT ON IT
gbvMqFhBqSU_17 0 WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO THE FRONT ONE I MIGHT BE IN YOUR WAY A LITTLE BIT HERE SO PLEASE A BARE WITH ME
gbvMqFhBqSU_18 0 ALRIGHT WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND START OUR NUT RIGHT THERE
gbvMqFhBqSU_19 0 AND THAT IS THE PROPER WAY TO IDENTIFY THE CORRECT CONTROL ARM AND REMOUNT IT ON THE VEHICLE

GJ7l-KApNvA_1 0 REMEMBER WHAT I WAS MENTIONING ABOUT USING OUR PICTURE FOR A GUIDE BUT ON A STRAIGHT JACKET

HGSFSLMYxXQ_1 0 HI WE'RE GOING INTO PROSTHETIC BASIC MAKEUP
HGSFSLMYxXQ_2 0 WE TOOK THE PROSTHETIC ITSELF AND REMEMBER WE TORE THE SCRIDGE AWAY

HGSFSLMYxXQ_12 0 THIS IS TELESIS BETA BOND ADHESIVE
HGSFSLMYxXQ_13 0 THIS IS FILM QUALITY ADHESIVE
HGSFSLMYxXQ_14 0 IT IS MADE LIKE A PROSTHETIC ADHESIVE IT WILL STAY ON ALL DAY
Hf9GLrjnuZM_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS RUSSELL KOMPINSKI AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE WE'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO PURCHASE AND ASSEMBLE A SKATEBOARD
Hf9GLrjnuZM_2 0 NOW IN CHOOSING THE BRAND NAMES OF DECKS IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER AS LONG AS YOU LIKE I SAID BEFORE AVOID THOSE LARGE DEPARTMENT STORES
Hf9GLrjnuZM_3 0 WHEN CHOOSING A DECK THERE ARE DIFFERENT BRANDS
Hf9GLrjnuZM_4 0 THERE IS BLANK DECKS
Hf9GLrjnuZM_5 0 THIS IS A BLANK BRAND HOWEVER IT DOES HAVE A LOGO ON IT
Hf9GLrjnuZM_6 0 THIS IS NAME BRAND AND SO IS THIS DECK
Hf9GLrjnuZM_7 0 HOWEVER BOTH ARE USED THIS BEING NEW
Hf9GLrjnuZM_8 0 NOW IN CHOOSING THE PRICE DOESN'T MATTER WHEN YOU GO INTO A SKATE SHOP
Hf9GLrjnuZM_9 0 YOU'RE MORE PAYING FOR THE BRAND NAME AND FOR THE LOGO
Hf9GLrjnuZM_10 0 A LOT OF SKATE COMPANIES ARE SISTER COMPANIES OF LARGER SKATE COMPANIES SO REALLY THE MANUFACTURING METHODS ARE ALL THE SAME
Hf9GLrjnuZM_11 0 WHEN CHOOSING THE TRUCKS ALL THE TRUCKS ARE GENERALLY THE SAME EXCEPT FOR YOU HAVE YOUR ALLEN KINGPIN AND YOU HAVE YOUR RATCHET KINGPIN
Hf9GLrjnuZM_12 0 THERE ARE DIFFERENT WEIGHTS TO THE TRUCKS
Hf9GLrjnuZM_13 0 SOME ARE MADE WITH DIFFERENT METALS AND ALLOYS
Hf9GLrjnuZM_14 0 SOME THAT GIVE THEM LIGHTER WEIGHT HOWEVER ARE ALL VERY DURABLE
Hf9GLrjnuZM_15 0 WHEN PURCHASING BEARINGS YOU DO GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR
Hf9GLrjnuZM_16 0 IF YOU SPEND THE TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR RANGE YOU WERE ABLE TO GET WATER RESISTANT BEARINGS SO THEY WILL NEVER LOCK UP ON YOU
Hf9GLrjnuZM_17 0 HOWEVER YOU CAN SPEND TEN DOLLARS AND YOU CAN STILL SKATE ROLL BUT EXPECT TO SPEND ANOTHER TEN DOLLARS IN ANOTHER MONTH
h1_N7_-FQuk_1 0 OKAY LET'S TALK ABOUT MONOCHROME ADJUSTMENT IN THE PICTURE STYLE SETTINGS
h1_N7_-FQuk_2 0 WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT ADJUSTING A BASIC OR GENERAL PICTURE STYLE BUT NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DEEPER IN HERE
h1_N7_-FQuk_3 0 SO GO AHEAD AND PRESS YOUR PICTURE STYLE BUTTON AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BACK SIDE OF THE CAMERA
h1_N7_-FQuk_4 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS SELECT MONOCHROME DOWN HERE ON THE BOTTOM
h1_N7_-FQuk_5 0 THIS IS ONE OF THE PICTURE STYLES
h1_N7_-FQuk_7 0 GO AHEAD AND SELECT MONOCHROME BY PRESSING INFO
h1_N7_-FQuk_8 0 THEN LET'S SCROLL DOWN TO THE FILTER EFFECTS
h1_N7_-FQuk_9 0 IF I SELECT THIS I HAVE THE OPTION OF USING EITHER NO FILTER A YELLOW FILTER AN ORANGE FILTER A RED FILTER OR A GREEN FILTER
h1_N7_-FQuk_10 0 THIS BASICALLY SELECTING ONE OF THESE HAS THE SAME EFFECT AS ACTUALLY PUTTING A FILTER THAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY SCREW ON TO THE FRONT OF YOUR LENS
h1_N7_-FQuk_11 0 THE CAMERA WILL AUTOMATICALLY MAKE THAT ADJUSTMENT
h1_N7_-FQuk_12 0 IF YOU USE A YELLOW FILTER THE BLUE SKY WILL LOOK MORE NATURAL AND THE WHITE CLOUDS WILL LOOK A LITTLE BIT CRISPER
h1_N7_-FQuk_13 0 IF YOU USE AN ORANGE FILTER THE BLUE SKY WILL LOOK A LITTLE BIT DARKER AND THE SUNSET WILL LOOK A LITTLE BIT MORE BRILLIANT
h1_N7_-FQuk_14 0 IF YOU USE A RED FILTER THE BLUE SKY WILL USUALLY LOOK A LITTLE BIT DARKER AND LEAVES WILL LOOK A LITTLE BIT CRISPER AND BRIGHTER
h1_N7_-FQuk_15 0 THEN IF YOU USE THE GREEN FILTER EFFECT SKIN TONE AND LIPS WILL LOOK REALLY GOOD BECAUSE THEY'RE RED AND GREEN IS THE OPPOSITE OF RED SO IT MAKES THOSE STICK OUT A LITTLE DARKER AND A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTRAST AND THEN TREE LEAVES AND STUFF LIKE THAT WILL LOOK BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME COLOR AS GREEN
h1_N7_-FQuk_16 0 SO IF YOU WANTED TO YOU COULD GO AHEAD AND SELECT LET'S SAY RED BECAUSE WE'RE SHOOTING SOME BLACK AND WHITE PORTRAITS OF PEOPLE WITH SAY THEY HAD SOME LIPSTICK ON
h1_N7_-FQuk_17 0 LET'S ACTUALLY SELECT GREEN AND THAT WILL MAKE THEIR LIPS AND SKIN LOOK REALLY CONTRASTY LET'S GO AHEAD AND SELECT THAT FOR THE FILTER EFFECT
h1_N7_-FQuk_18 0 GO DOWN GO AHEAD AND HIT MENU HERE BACK TO THE PICTURE STYLES
h1_N7_-FQuk_19 0 SO YOU'VE SELECTED MONOCHROME AND WE'VE GONE IN THERE AND PICKED UP A FILTER AND THAT SHOULD APPLY THE FILTER TO OUR SETTINGS
h1_N7_-FQuk_20 0 NOW WHEN WE SHOOT WE'LL END UP WITH A VERY NICE MONOCHROMATIC CONTRASTY PORTRAIT STYLE
GtPF8mYVVzQ_1 0 IN THIS VIDEO I'M GOING TO BE GOING OVER ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIXER
GtPF8mYVVzQ_2 0 SO WHEN YOU GET A SCRATCH OR BATTLE STYLE MIXER YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TWO CHANNEL FADERS AND WHAT EACH CHANNEL FADER IS IS ONE CHANNEL CONTROLS ONE TURNTABLE AND THE OTHER CHANNEL OBVIOUSLY CONTROLS THE OTHER TURNTABLE
GtPF8mYVVzQ_3 0 IT'S JUST A GLORIFIED VOLUME CONTROL ARE THE TWO FADERS
GtPF8mYVVzQ_4 0 YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE SOME EQ KNOBS
GtPF8mYVVzQ_5 0 WITH THE EQ KNOBS THEY'RE THREE KNOBS THAT CORRESPOND TO THE LOW FREQUENCY SOUNDS THE LOW PITCHES THE MIDDLE FREQUENCY SOUNDS USUALLY FOR LIKE A VOICE ON A HIP-HOP RECORD AND THE VERY HIGH FREQUENCY SOUNDS
GtPF8mYVVzQ_6 0 SO A QUICK DEMONSTRATION CUTTING THE LOW FREQUENCY SOUNDS THE MID-RANGE SOUNDS SOUNDS KIND OF MUFFLED WHERE THE VOICE WOULD BE AND THE HIGH FREQUENCY SOUNDS OR YOU CAN CUT ALL THREE OF THEM
GyEToz8_FXE_1 0 WE TOOK THIS OUT OF THE DRY CLEANING MACHINE AND I STEAM CLEANED A SPOT ON IT AND I TOOK IT OFF HE HANGER SO IT WOULD NOT STRETCH
GyEToz8_FXE_2 0 WE ARE THEN GOING TO DO THE FINISHING PRESSING ON IT AND AT THAT POINT I WILL TAKE THE TWO GARMENTS AND THEY ARE HANGING HERE
GyEToz8_FXE_3 0 I WOULD LOOK AT THE NECK AND SEE THAT THIS IS A 2403 THE TICKET I HAD WHEN I PUT THE NAME OF THE CUSTOMER ON THE ORIGINALS
GyEToz8_FXE_4 0 I CHECK FOR THIS GARMENT AND THEN I WOULD CHECK THIS
GyEToz8_FXE_5 0 I MIGHT HAVE 25 TO THIRTY GARMENTS HERE
GyEToz8_FXE_6 0 I LOOK FOR THIS ONE THE SAME AND I WOULD THEN HAVE TO FOLD IT UP NICE AND RE-PUT IT ON ITS HANGER
GyEToz8_FXE_7 0 NOW IF THIS WAS A SILK GARMENT I MIGHT PUT TISSUE PAPER IF IT IS A VERY FINE GARMENT OVER THE HANGER BUT BEING THIS IS JUST WOOL HERE IT WILL NOT MATTER
GyEToz8_FXE_8 0 I HAVE CHECKED THE TICKETS
GyEToz8_FXE_9 0 I HAVE NOTICED THAT THESE ARE 2403
GyEToz8_FXE_10 0 I WOULD FIND THE RIGHT TICKET WITH THE NAME OF THE CUSTOMER BEING GRACE SIPPEL IT'S ONE OF MINE
GyEToz8_FXE_11 0 NOW I HAVE THE SWEATERS AND IT IS THIS TICKET AND THIS CUSTOMER
GyEToz8_FXE_12 0 I WOULD THEN PUT IT ON HERE IT IS ONE OF MY OWN BUT I LIKE TO BAG THEM ANYWAY
GyEToz8_FXE_13 0 I WOULD FIND THESE SHIRT BAG I WOULD PUT IT ON IT AND THIS IS THE BAG AREA
GyEToz8_FXE_14 0 I WOULD BAG IT UP TAKE THE BAG OFF TAKE MY STAPLE GUN AND STAPLE THIS TO THE GARMENT AND I NOW KNOW THAT IN THE DOLLY
gEKy_VmSGcU_1 0 HI THIS IS RICH BUCCOLA HERE IN NEW YORK CITY AND TODAY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE WASABI MASHED POTATOES
gEKy_VmSGcU_2 0 OKAY FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW WASABI AND WHAT'S IT ABOUT IT'S VERY STRONG AND IN ITS DRY FORM IT'S VERY POWERFUL
gEKy_VmSGcU_3 0 TODAY I WAS USING A SAUCE JUST TRYING TO TASTE YOU KNOW IF THERE WILL BE A DIFFERENCE OR HOW SIMILAR
gEKy_VmSGcU_4 0 I NOTICED THAT BY PUTTING ONLY THE FOUR TEASPOONS OR THREE TEASPOONS IT'S NOT ENOUGH
gEKy_VmSGcU_5 0 SO AS YOU TASTE IT I'VE ALSO LEARNED IN THE KITCHEN IT'S ALWAYS BETTER TO HAVE TO ADD SOMETHING THAN TO HAVE TO TAKE IT AWAY IF YOU PUT TOO MUCH
gEKy_VmSGcU_6 0 SO I'VE BEEN SLOWLY ADDING IT AND GRACIE ALWAYS KNOWS WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT ON THESE VIDEOS
gEKy_VmSGcU_7 0 I'M JUST GOING TO ADD ANOTHER TWO TEASPOONS AND MIX THAT IN AND I'M GOING TO TASTE IT
gEKy_VmSGcU_8 0 IF I NEED TO ADD MORE OR YOU NEED TO ADD MORE BECAUSE YOU'RE USING THE WASABI SAUCE DO THE SAME
gEKy_VmSGcU_9 0 REMEMBER THE WASABI PASTE IS ALSO VERY POWERFUL MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN THE SAUCE
gEKy_VmSGcU_10 0 NOW THAT OUR POTATOES ARE DONE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE WASABI SAUCE
gEKy_VmSGcU_11 0 WASABI SAUCE I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A LITTLE STRONG UNTIL I TASTED IT
gEKy_VmSGcU_12 0 IT TURNS OUT IT WAS JUST MIXED WITH HEAVY CREAM WHICH IS ACTUALLY EXCELLENT FOR THE POTATOES
gEKy_VmSGcU_13 0 BUT WHERE I USED TO ONLY USE LIKE TWO OR THREE OF THE DRY WASABI TWO OR THREE TEASPOONS I HAD TO PUT IN LIKE SIX TO EIGHT TEASPOONS TO REALLY TASTE THE WASABI
gEKy_VmSGcU_14 0 NOW REALIZE THAT PASTE IS ALSO VERY STRONG STRAIGHT PASTE YOU'LL ONLY GOING TO WANT TO GO WITH ONE OR TWO TEASPOONS THEN TASTE AND ADD MORE IF YOU LIKE IT
gNEb3wpOYhI_1 0 SO A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T GET INVOLVED WITH SEED SAVING BECAUSE THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF CROSS-POLLINATION OR THEY THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE PURE SEED
gNEb3wpOYhI_2 0 AND WELL PEOPLE ARE USED TO GOING TO THE STORE OR TRUSTING THE AUTHORITIES FOR THEIR MATERIALS AND RESOURCES
gNEb3wpOYhI_3 0 HOWEVER I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT TODAY THAT YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO BE SO CONCERNED ESPECIALLY IN THE BACKYARD GARDEN
gNEb3wpOYhI_4 0 FOR A SEED COMPANY IF YOU GET OFF-TYPES SAY OF A BEET OR A CORN THAT COULD BE A DISASTER BECAUSE THEY'RE RELYING ON THE ADVERTISING AND THE CLAIM OF PURE SEED
gNEb3wpOYhI_5 0 HOWEVER IN A BACKYARD GARDEN IF YOU GET A FEW YELLOW BEETS WITH YOUR PINK ONES OR A FEW PINK CARROTS WITH YOUR ORANGE ONES THAT MAY NOT BE A LIABILITY IT MAY IN FACT BE A BLESSING
gNEb3wpOYhI_6 0 WHEN YOU THROW THE GENES INTO PLAY WHETHER IT'S WITH THE SQUASH OR THE TOMATOES YOU SOMETIMES COME UP WITH SOME MIRACULOUS RESULTS
gNEb3wpOYhI_7 0 SO I'M NOT GOING TO BRAG ABOUT THIS SQUMPKIN HOWEVER HOW DO YOU THINK SOME OF THESE REMARKABLE VARIETIES EVOLVED
gNEb3wpOYhI_8 0 ORIGINALLY THESE EVOLVED OUT OF THE SELECTED CROSSES THE RANDOM CROSSES I SHOULD SAY OF GENETIC MATERIAL WHICH CERTAIN PEOPLE BACK IN HISTORY FOUND DESIRABLE INTERESTING BEAUTIFUL OR TASTY
gNEb3wpOYhI_9 0 AND THEY WERE SPECIAL ENOUGH FOR THEM TO SAVE AND TO PRESERVE
gNEb3wpOYhI_10 0 SO AGAIN WHILE IT'S IMPORTANT TO OBSERVE THE PRINCIPLES OF PURITY AND SELF-POLLINATION VERSUS CROSS-POLLINATION JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO ISOLATE OR HAND-POLLINATE YOUR CROSS-POLLINATING CROPS DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T TRY GROWING THEIR SEED
gNEb3wpOYhI_11 0 AND YOU CAN ALWAYS DO A TEST AND IF YOUR TEST SHOWS THAT YOU'VE GOT WHAT YOU WANTED OR SOMETHING THAT'S DESIRABLE NONETHELESS WELL THAT'S INTERESTING AND IT MIGHT EVEN YIELD SOME REMARKABLE RESULTS
gPpa4nBZcK8_1 0 TO BEGIN WITH THE STABILITY ON THE BOSU WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN AND YOU ARE GOING TO BRING THE BLACK SIDE TO THE TOP AND THE BALL PART IS GOING TO BE ON THE BOTTOM AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO PUT MY FEET ON HERE IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT O'KAY AND YOU MIGHT BE A LITTLE NERVOUS BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO BRING BOTH OF YOUR FEET ON TOP OF THE BALL AND IT LOOKS JUST LIKE THAT
gPpa4nBZcK8_2 0 YOU WANT YOUR FEET ABOUT HIP WIDTH APART
gPpa4nBZcK8_3 0 NOW SOMETIMES IT CAN HELP IF YOU DEFLATE THE BALL A LITTLE BIT TO GET STARTED BUT THIS ONE IS PRETTY BLOWN UP AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO BRING OURSELVES UP ON TOP OF THAT BALL AND WORK ON GETTING THAT BALANCE BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING ELSE
gPpa4nBZcK8_4 0 THIS IS JUST BASIC STABILITY
gPpa4nBZcK8_5 0 YOU ARE STANDING ON THE BOSU PULLING YOUR BELLY BUTTON TO THE SPINE AND THEN THE NEXT THING WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO SLOWLY COME ON DOWN AND BRING YOUR HANDS DOWN TOWARD YOUR FEET AND YOU WANT TO DO THAT ABOUT EIGHT TO TEN TIMES DEPENDING ON HOW GOOD YOUR STABILITY IS
gPpa4nBZcK8_6 0 IT COULD BE EASY FOR YOU OR IT COULD BE A CHALLENGE FOR YOU
gPpa4nBZcK8_7 0 AGAIN YOU JUST WANT TO COME ON DOWN AND TOUCH YOUR TOES AND COME ON UP
gPpa4nBZcK8_8 0 REAL SIMPLE EXERCISE BUT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING AND THAT IS BASIC STABILITY ON THE BOSU
G9tCHFntK_g_2 0 MY NAME IS GRADY JOHNSON AND I'M A PROFESSIONAL PAINTER AND TODAY I REPRESENT EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
G9tCHFntK_g_3 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT POURING UP OUR EXTERIOR PAINT
G9tCHFntK_g_4 0 NOW WHENEVER YOU'RE POURING OUT PAINTS YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND MAKE SURE THAT THE AREA YOU'RE POURING IT UP ON IS COMPLETELY SAFE
G9tCHFntK_g_5 0 I LIKE TO USE CARDBOARD BECAUSE CARDBOARD DOESN'T SOAK THROUGH LIKE A DROP CLOTH DOES AND IT'S REALLY EASY TO MOVE AROUND AND PLACE
G9tCHFntK_g_6 0 SO I PUT DOWN A NICE BIG PIECE OF CARDBOARD AND I'M READY TO POUR UP
G9tCHFntK_g_7 0 THE FIRST THING I NEED TO DO IS BREAK THIS SEAL ON THE CAN
G9tCHFntK_g_8 0 ONCE YOU BREAK THE SEAL WITH YOUR PUTTY KNIFE OR FIVE IN ONE TOOL JUST GO AHEAD AND POP THAT ALL THE WAY AROUND THE CAN UNTIL THE TOP COMES ALL THE WAY OFF
G9tCHFntK_g_9 0 THIS IS ALL SEALED AROUND HERE SO FIRST WE WANT TO POP IT UP
G9tCHFntK_g_10 0 THEN JUST KEEP WORKING IT AROUND LIKE THAT ALL THE WAY AROUND THE RIM OF THE CAN TILL WE POP THAT TOP COMPLETELY OFF
G9tCHFntK_g_11 0 YOU WANT TO PULL THAT OFF AND JUST SET THAT UP OUT OF THE WAY
G9tCHFntK_g_12 0 ONCE YOU HAVE THAT DONE YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND GET YOUR HANDLE BACK ON YOUR WORK BACK AWAY FROM YOU
G9tCHFntK_g_13 0 THAT WAY IF ANY PAINT FLIES OVER IT'S NOT GOING LAND ON THAT HANDLE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT OUR HANDS ON

G9tCHFntK_g_15 0 YOU CAN ALSO GET STICKS AT THE PAINT STORE
G9tCHFntK_g_16 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS STIR THIS STUFF FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CAN ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TOP AND KEEP STIRRING IT UNTIL IT'S ALL MIXED UP
G9tCHFntK_g_17 0 NOW IF YOU HAVE COLORANT IN THE CAN IT'S GOING TO START CHANGING THE COLOR AND BRINGING THAT COLORANT UP
G9tCHFntK_g_18 0 GO AHEAD AND START STIRRING IT AND JUST START PULLING THAT STUFF UP FROM THE BOTTOM UP TO THE TOP
G9tCHFntK_g_19 0 THAT YOU WANT TO GET MIXED IN REALLY REALLY GOOD SO THAT IT WILL COVER PROPERLY
G9tCHFntK_g_20 0 THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING
G9tCHFntK_g_21 0 YOU'RE PULLING THAT STUFF FROM THE BOTTOM UP TO THE TOP AND YOU KEEP GOING UNTIL YOU FEEL CONSISTENCY IS GOOD

G9tCHFntK_g_24 0 BE SURE AND WIPE THAT ALL OFF RIGHT A WAY
G9tCHFntK_g_25 0 BY DOING THIS YOU'RE GETTING ANY OF THE GLOBS THAT ARE HANGING AROUND OFF OF THE STICK SO THAT YOU CAN SET IT OUT OF THE WAY WITHOUT CASING ANY PROBLEMS
G9tCHFntK_g_27 0 YOU SET THAT A SIDE
G9tCHFntK_g_28 0 NOW YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND POUR YOUR PAINT
G9tCHFntK_g_29 0 YOU GRAB YOUR PAINT GET YOUR CAN READY AND KEEP THE HANDLE OF THE CAN OVER HERE SO THAT WHEN IT FLIPS IT DOESN'T GET ONTO THE HANDLE
G9tCHFntK_g_30 0 YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND THROW THAT ON OUT AND YOU JUST FLIP IT OVER IN ONE ACTION TILL IT HITS THE PLACE WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO
G9tCHFntK_g_31 0 WHEN YOU DO THAT THAT'S GOING TO STOP THAT FLOW OF PAINT AND THEN EVEN IT OFF

HIptbvpk2xo_1 0 HI I'M JUAN CARLOS WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
HIptbvpk2xo_2 0 TODAY I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO SLIDE
HIptbvpk2xo_3 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TEACH HOW TO SLIDE HEADFIRST
HIptbvpk2xo_4 0 NORMALLY WHEN YOU'RE STEALING SECOND BASE THIS IS A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE SLIDE AS IF YOU WERE SLIDING REGULAR WITH FEET AHEAD GOING TO SECOND BASE
HIptbvpk2xo_5 0 NOW AS YOUR COMING TOWARDS THE PLATE YOU WANT YOUR MOMENTUM TO BE FULLY ON YOUR FRONT SIDE NORMALLY ON YOUR SHOULDERS AND EVERYTHING AS IF YOU WERE FALLING FORWARD
HIptbvpk2xo_6 0 NOW AS THE RUNNER IS COMING AS SHE'S PUSHING TOWARDS THE BASE THE MOMENTUM AS SHE IS ABOUT TO FALL GET LOW AND THEN EXTEND WITH BOTH OF HER HANDS GOING TO THE BASE
G839uQf0kfc_1 0 HI I'M BILL WITH ZOAR OUTDOOR ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM WE ARE HERE TODAY AT A CHAPEL LEDGES AT ASHFIELD MASSACHUSETTS AND IN THIS SERIES I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE BASICS OF MOVING ON ROCK
G839uQf0kfc_2 0 TECHNIQUE OF MOVING ON ROCK CAN BE GENERALIZED INTO A FEW PIECES ONE THING IS TO REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE NOT CLIMBING A LADDER
G839uQf0kfc_3 0 THERE MIGHT BE HOLES THAT YOU CAN PULL STRAIGHT DOWN ON BUT THERE MAY NOT BE AND IF YOU ARE NOT OPEN TO THE IDEA OF USING HOLES THAT DON'T LOOK LIKE LADDER LINES YOU WOULD MISS OUT ON A LOT
G839uQf0kfc_4 0 SO DON'T ALWAYS IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO STEP UP AND PULL DOWN JUST LIKE CLIMBING A LADDER
G839uQf0kfc_5 0 ANOTHER IDEAS IS THAT LEGS ARE STRONGER THEN ARMS YOU DON'T NEED TO DO PULL UPS ALL THE WAY UP THE CLIFF TO GET TO THE TOP
G839uQf0kfc_6 0 IN FACT MOST PEOPLE CAN'T EVEN GOOD CLIMBERS YOU WANT TO USE YOUR LEGS IN A LOT OF CLIMBING TECHNIQUES IS FIGURING HOW TO PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR FEET TO SPARE YOUR ARMS
G839uQf0kfc_7 0 THIRD THING YOUR BONES ARE STRONGER THEN YOUR MUSCLES SO IF I CAN FIND A WAY TO PUSH DOWN AND USE MY BONE ON MY ARM OR ON MY LEG THEN THAT IS GOING TO SAVE MY MUSCLES A LOT OF WORK
G839uQf0kfc_8 0 SO YOU ALWAYS WANT TO USE MY BONES WHEN I CAN
G839uQf0kfc_9 0 WON'T ALWAYS BE ABLE TO DO IT BUT THOSE PIECES WOULD HELP YOU REMEMBER THAT HOLES ARE NOT ALWAYS LIKE LADDER LINES LEG ARE STRONGER THEN ARMS AND BONES ARE STRONGER THEN MUSCLES
GWKH-f_RT-Y_1 0 ALRIGHT SO BEFORE WE START THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT STAGE COMBAT IS SAFETY
GWKH-f_RT-Y_2 0 THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD KNOW IF YOU NEVER TRIED STAGE COMBAT IS THAT YOU DON'T EVER EVER EVER HIT ANYBODY
GWKH-f_RT-Y_3 0 YOU NEVER HIT SOMEONE YOU NEVER MAKE CONTACT WITH ANYBODY
GWKH-f_RT-Y_4 0 YOU'RE ALWAYS HITTING AROUND OR YOU'RE FAKING IT OUT IN SOME WAY TO TRICK THE AUDIENCE
GWKH-f_RT-Y_5 0 THAT'S WHY IT'S STAGE THAT'S WHY IT'S FAKE
GWKH-f_RT-Y_6 0 ANOTHER THING IS BEFORE YOU GO AND START PRACTICING STAGE COMBAT WHAT YOU SHOULD ALWAYS DO IS HAVE AN OUTLINE OR HAVE A REALLY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING IN THE SCENE OR IN THE STAGE FIGHT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING
GWKH-f_RT-Y_7 0 YOU NEVER WANT TO IMPERVIOUS YOU NEVER WANT TO MAKE IT UP ON THE SPOT BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN SOMEONE REALLY GETS HURT
GWKH-f_RT-Y_8 0 EVERY PUNCH EVERY MOVE EVERY STEP BEFORE YOU START PRACTICING SHOULD BE WELL THOUGHT OUT
GWKH-f_RT-Y_9 0 ALSO BEFORE YOU START PRACTICING STAGE COMBAT YOU REALLY NEED TO FIND A SPACE THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF ROOM IN
GWKH-f_RT-Y_10 0 LIKE IN THIS ROOM WE'VE CLEARED OUT MOST EVERYTHING SO THAT IF I FALL OR I SLIP OR TRIP I'M NOT GOING TO HIT MY HEAD ON A CORNER OF A COUCH OR I'M NOT GOING TO KNOCK A WHOLE BUNCH OF BOOKS OFF A SHELF OR ANYTHING EVERYTHING IS PRETTY CLEAR
GWKH-f_RT-Y_11 0 ALSO YOU WANT A FLOOR THAT'S OKAY IF IT'S SEMI HARD
GWKH-f_RT-Y_12 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE FALLING YOU ALWAYS WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE WHERE THERE'S A MAT OR EVEN OUTSIDE ON YOUR LAWN OR ON THE BEACH
GWKH-f_RT-Y_13 0 YOU NEVER WANT TO FALL ON LIKE CONCRETE OR ASPHALT YOU CAN REALLY SCREW YOURSELF UP THAT WAY
GWKH-f_RT-Y_14 0 THOSE ARE SOME BASIC BASIC BASIC THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE YOU START PRACTICING THE STAGE COMBAT
GX8tH2NQFXY_1 0 HITMAN BLOOD MONEY IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF IO INTERACTIVE A COMPANY WITH WHICH I HAVE NO AFFILIATION
GX8tH2NQFXY_2 0 SO CONTINUE ON THROUGH THIS A LITTLE BACK PASSAGE WAY WE'RE STARTING TO GET INTO THE VIP AREA NOW WHERE ALL THE COOL KIDS HANG OUT
GX8tH2NQFXY_3 0 AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN GO HERE THE FIRST WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO IS TO THE RIGHT AND THERE'S ANOTHER SECURITY CHECK POINT HERE AND A COOL A ART DECO STYLE LAMP THERE
GX8tH2NQFXY_4 0 SO AGAIN JUST WAIT THEY WILL SCREEN YOU FOR GUNS OR OTHER CONTRABAND AND A THEN THEY'LL LET YOU ON THROUGH
GX8tH2NQFXY_5 0 ALRIGHT WE'RE GOOD TO GO SO WE CAN GO ON THROUGH HERE AND THIS LEADS INTO AN ELEVATOR THAT'LL TAKE US UP TO THE A MAIN BEDROOM OF OUR HOST A SORT OF A HUGH HEFNER LIKE CHARACTER WE WANT TO CHOOSE STUDIO FROM THE OPTIONS AND WE CAN TAKE HIM OUT THERE
GX8tH2NQFXY_6 0 SO THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO SAVE YOUR GAME BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET
GX8tH2NQFXY_7 0 THIS IS KIND OF A LONG LEVEL SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND SAVE IT
HibeZ7jFGwc_1 0 IN THIS SECTION I WILL BE TEACHING YOU HOW TO CARVE A SKI TURN AS OPPOSED TO SWITCHING THE SKI TURN AROUND AND BEING KIND OF SLOPPY GOING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN
HibeZ7jFGwc_2 0 THE DIFFERENCE IS INSTEAD LAYING SO MUCH PRESSURE ON THIS FOOT AND SWITCHING YOUR BODY AROUND YOU ARE GOING TO PUT FORWARD PRESSURE ON YOUR BOOT WHICH IS GOING TO ALLOW THE INSIDE EDGE OF THE SKI TO WORK BY ITSELF AND CARVE THE TURN OUT
HibeZ7jFGwc_3 0 WHEN YOU ARE SHIFTING FEET WHAT YOU DO IS SHIFT WEIGHT TO THE FORWARD PRESSURE OF THIS BOOT AND THIS WILL HELP YOU CARVE OUT THIS TURNOUT
HibeZ7jFGwc_4 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS PUTTING FORWARD PRESSURE AND ALLOWING THE SKI TO WORK WITH ITS ACTUAL SHAPE INSTEAD OF MUSCLE THE SKI AROUND LIKE BEFORE
HibeZ7jFGwc_5 0 THE REASON FOR USING A CARVING TURN AS OPPOSED TO A BASIC NO SKI TURN IS IT ALLOWS YOU TO TURN WITH MORE SPEED BE MORE FLUID AND IF YOU ARE PROGRESSING AND SKIING ON STEEPER MORE ADVANCED SKI RUNS THIS WILL MAKE YOU SO YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE IT DOWN MORE SAFELY
HibeZ7jFGwc_6 0 IT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING EVERYONE DOES WANT TO LEARN AS OPPOSED TO SWITCHING YOUR BODY SIDEWAYS BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO MAKE YOU A BETTER ALL AROUND SKIER
HibeZ7jFGwc_7 0 THIS WILL HELP YOU BE MORE IN CONTROL AND AS A RESULT HAVE MORE FUN WITH IT
HibeZ7jFGwc_8 0 WHAT I WILL BE WALKING YOU THROUGH NOW IS HOW TO CARVE A SKI TURN
HibeZ7jFGwc_9 0 THIS IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFERENT THAN THE SKI TURNS THAT YOU MAY HAVE PREVIOUSLY LEARNED
HibeZ7jFGwc_10 0 WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE SWITCHING OUR BODY AROUND WE ARE ACTUALLY LETTING THE SKIS WORK WITH THEIR NATURAL SHAPE
HibeZ7jFGwc_11 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS APPLY FORWARD PRESSURE TO THE BOOT THIS IS GOING TO BE YOUR DOWNHILL SKI
HibeZ7jFGwc_12 0 SO IF WE ARE GOING TO BE MAKING A LEFT HILL TURN WE ARE GOING TO BE APPLYING PRESSURE TO THE RIGHT BOOT
HibeZ7jFGwc_13 0 IF WE ARE GOING TO BE MAKING A LEFT HILL TURN WE ARE GOING TO APPLY FORWARD PRESSURE TO YOUR LEFT BOOT
HibeZ7jFGwc_14 0 ALONG WITH THIS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE TAKING OFF A LITTLE PRESSURE OFF YOUR UPHILL SKI
HibeZ7jFGwc_15 0 NOW I WILL BE MAKING SOME TURNS AND WALK YOU THROUGH IT AS I DO IT
HibeZ7jFGwc_16 0 IF YOU NOTICE I AM STARTING OFF WITH THE PROPER STANCE AND I WILL BE APPLYING FORWARD PRESSURE TO THE LEFT FOOT THEN FORWARD PRESSURE TO THE RIGHT FOOT
HibeZ7jFGwc_17 0 THIS WILL BE MAKING A SMOOTH TURN AS OPPOSED TO SWITCHING MY BODY AROUND
HibeZ7jFGwc_18 0 AS YOU CAN NOTICE YOU CAN SEE THE SKI TRACKS WHERE I WENT IT IS A SMOOTH LINE THERE I AM NOT SWITCHING MY BODY AROUND IT WILL BE A LOT FASTER AND A LOT MORE EFFECTIVE WAY TO SKI
gfEoLbSQLow_1 0 HI I'M TONY NEWTON FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ESTABLISHING A PRACTICE FOR LEARNING TO PLAY THE PIANO
gfEoLbSQLow_2 0 ESTABLISHING A PRACTICE ROUTINE FOR LEARNING TO PLAY THE PIANO
gfEoLbSQLow_3 0 ESTABLISHING A PRACTICE ROUTINE IS PARAMOUNT IF YOU WANT TO SUCCEED IN PLAYING THE PIANO CAUSE IT IS A THING THAT YOU NEED TO DO REGULARLY AND INTENSELY TO GET ANYWHERE
gfEoLbSQLow_4 0 I MEANS YOU CAN PRACTICE ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS BUT YOU ARE PROGRESS WOULD DEFINITELY SLOW DOWN
gfEoLbSQLow_5 0 OKAY LET'S TALK ABOUT SO I WOULD SAY AT LEAST A HALF A HOUR EVERYBODY COULD AFFORD A HALF OF HOUR THREE TIMES A WEEK AND THAT WOULD BE A WAY TO START AND THEN YOU COULD ADD FIFTEEN MINUTES TO THAT AS YOU GO ALONG UNTIL YOU WORK YOUR SELF UP TO TWO THREE HOURS DEPENDING IF YOU WANT TO BECOME A PROFESSIONAL OR IF YOU JUST WANT IT TO BE A HOBBY SO THAT PLAYS GOOD MUSIC
gfEoLbSQLow_6 0 OR IF YOU JUST WANT TO IMPERVIOUS AND WRITE SONGS
gfEoLbSQLow_7 0 NOW IN THE PROCESS OF PRACTICING THERE ARE THREE THINGS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT THAT IS THAT YOU NEED TO CONCENTRATE ON IN THAT IS TECHNIQUE MUSICIANSHIP AND REPERTOIRE
gfEoLbSQLow_8 0 OKAY TECHNIQUE MUSICIANSHIP AND REPERTOIRE
gfEoLbSQLow_9 0 TECHNIQUE IS HOW YOU ARE ACTUALLY USING YOUR HANDS YOUR BODY AND YOUR WRIST AND ALL OF THAT RIGHT
gfEoLbSQLow_10 0 MUSICIANSHIP IS KNOWING WHAT YOU ARE PLAYING UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU ARE PLAYING
gfEoLbSQLow_11 0 IF YOU ARE PLAYING A C CHORD THEN YOU KNOW YOU ARE PLAYING A C CHORD IF YOU ARE PLAYING A C SCALE THEN YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE PLAYING A C SCALE
gfEoLbSQLow_12 0 THAT MEANS MUSICIANSHIP MEANS UNDERSTANDING TECHNICALLY MUSICALLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING
gfEoLbSQLow_13 0 REPERTOIRE OF COURSE IS ALWAYS PRACTICE A SONG OR A SOME TYPE OF WHOLE SONG THAT YOU CAN PLAY EVEN IF IT IS JUST CHORDS OR WHATEVER BUT THEN YOU ADD NEW SONGS EVERY TIME AND YOU SIT DOWN TO PLAY IT
gfEoLbSQLow_14 0 THESE THREE THINGS TECHNIQUES MUSICIANSHIP AND REPERTOIRE ALWAYS KEEP THESE THINGS IN MIND WHEN YOU ARE ESTABLISHING YOUR PRACTICING ROUTINE AND THE NEXT PART OF THAT IS THE DISCIPLINE TO APPLY THOSE
gfEoLbSQLow_15 0 DON'T FORGET CAUSE IF YOU ONLY STUDY TECHNIQUE AND REPERTOIRE THEN YOU GOING TO MISS OUT IN MUSICIANSHIP AND SOMEBODY IS GOING TO ASK YOU WHAT YOU ARE PLAYING AND YOU DON'T KNOW
gfEoLbSQLow_16 0 OR IF YOU ONLY STUDY MUSICIANSHIP AND YOU PLAY THE SONGS THEN YOUR TECHNIQUE WON'T GROW SO AS LONG AS YOU ARE AWARE OF THESE THREE FACTS OF YOUR PROGRESS AND IF YOU ARE PLAYING THEN YOU WOULD ALWAYS BE ABLE TO INVOLVE IN YOUR CREATIVITY AND TECHNIQUE
GmBAme-Ik_c_1 0 OKAY IN THIS DRILL GARY'S GOING TO HIT PREDOMINANTLY LOBS AND I'M GOING TO HIT A BOAST
GmBAme-Ik_c_2 0 SO A LOT OF TIME PEOPLE DON'T GET ENOUGH PRACTICE ON THEIR LOBS SO DOING THIS VERSION OF THE BOAST DRIVE DRILL IT'S ANOTHER DRIVE WE'RE GOING TO HIT A BOAST CROSS COURT WE'RE GOING TO HIT A LOB
GmBAme-Ik_c_3 0 SO I'M GOING TO HIT A BOAST GARY'S GOING TO HIT A LOB
GmBAme-Ik_c_4 0 SO IT'S A NICE EASY RELAXED DRILL BUT IT WORKS ON A VERY VERY IMPORTANT SHOT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ON YOUR PRACTICE
GmBAme-Ik_c_5 0 SO HERE WE GO
GmBAme-Ik_c_6 0 GOOD SHOT GARY
GmBAme-Ik_c_7 0 IT'S A NICE DEEP LOB
GmBAme-Ik_c_8 0 THAT'S EXCELLENT SHOT
GmBAme-Ik_c_9 0 SO IF WE WERE PLAYING A GAME RIGHT NOW WHEN HE HITS A LOB OF THAT QUALITY IT FORCES THE PLAYER AT THE TEE INTO THE BACK CORNER
GmBAme-Ik_c_10 0 SO SEE HOW HE GETS UNDERNEATH THE BALL
GmBAme-Ik_c_11 0 HE GETS LOW
GmBAme-Ik_c_12 0 VERY GOOD GARY
GmBAme-Ik_c_13 0 HE GETS LOW AND HE HITS THE BALL HIGH OFF THE FRONT WALL
GmBAme-Ik_c_14 0 SO IT COMES DOWN REAL SLOW
GmBAme-Ik_c_15 0 GOOD SHOT GARY
GmBAme-Ik_c_16 0 IT'S PRETTY TOUGH
GmBAme-Ik_c_17 0 AWE IT'S REAL TOUGH
GmBAme-Ik_c_18 0 SO THAT'S THE LOB BOAST DRILL
GmBAme-Ik_c_19 0 AND TRY TO HIT IT THERE REALLY GOOD
GmBAme-Ik_c_20 0 SO THAT'S THE LOB BOAST DRILL AND IT WORKS ON YOUR CROSS COURT LOB LIKE NO OTHER DRILL
GmBAme-Ik_c_21 0 YOU GET A LOT OF REPETITIONS IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME
GmBAme-Ik_c_22 0 IT'S THE BEST WAY TO PERFECT THAT SHOT
hb1ENFQrnYU_1 0 SO WHEN I DO THIS I GO STEP BY STEP
hb1ENFQrnYU_2 0 AT THE BEGINNING I TRY TO DO LET'S SAY THREE THROWS
hb1ENFQrnYU_3 0 I TELL TO MYSELF O.K LET'S DO THREE THROWS
hb1ENFQrnYU_4 0 ONE TWO THREE THEN I CATCH AND I CLOSE IT
hb1ENFQrnYU_5 0 AND THEN I TRY TO DO THE SAME THREE THROWS WITH MY LEFT HAND AS WELL
hb1ENFQrnYU_6 0 ONE TWO THREE AND THEN I CATCH IT
hb1ENFQrnYU_7 0 AND THEN I SAY O.K I CAN GO FURTHER
hb1ENFQrnYU_8 0 SO I DO NOW FIVE OR SIX UP
hb1ENFQrnYU_9 0 HMM MAYBE I DO FIVE
hb1ENFQrnYU_10 0 ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE AND THEN I CATCH
hb1ENFQrnYU_11 0 I DO THE SAME WITH MY LEFT HAND
hb1ENFQrnYU_12 0 IF I DROP ITS NOT A PROBLEM I CONTINUE DOING MY FIVE THROWS AND THEN I CATCH UNTIL I CAN DO IT
hb1ENFQrnYU_14 0 I CAN ONLY DO FIVE THROWS
hb1ENFQrnYU_16 0 NOW I DO THE SAME WITH MY LEFT HAND UNTIL I CAN DO THE SAME FIVE THROWS WITH MY LEFT HAND AS WELL
hb1ENFQrnYU_17 0 AND THEN I GO FURTHER AND I SAY O.K
hb1ENFQrnYU_18 0 I WAS ABLE DOING FIVE THROWS NOW I WILL DO TEN THROWS
hb1ENFQrnYU_19 0 AND I DO MY TEN THROWS AND I KEEP ON DOING DOING DOING IT UNTIL I CAN DO MY TEN THROWS
hb1ENFQrnYU_20 0 AND WHEN I CAN DO IT I DO THE SAME WITH MY LEFT HAND
hb1ENFQrnYU_21 0 AND ON THIS WAY WE CAN GO FURTHER FURTHER AND FURTHER AND CATCH ALL THE THROWS AND KEEP ON FOR A LONG LONG TIME AS LONG AS YOU CAN
hb1ENFQrnYU_22 0 AND IF YOU DROP WE JUST HAVE TO STAND AND CONTINUE
hb1ENFQrnYU_23 0 WE UNDERSTOOD ALREADY HOW TO DO OUTSIDE CIRCLE WITH TWO BALLS IN ONE HAND
hb1ENFQrnYU_24 0 SO NOW WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO THE INSIDE CIRCLE
hb1ENFQrnYU_25 0 THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT TOO BIG
hb1ENFQrnYU_26 0 THE ONLY THING IS THE DIRECTION
hb1ENFQrnYU_27 0 NOW I'M DOING FROM INSIDE TO OUTSIDE
hb1ENFQrnYU_28 0 NOW I'M GOING FROM OUTSIDE TO INSIDE
hb1ENFQrnYU_29 0 AND I KEEP THE SAME CIRCLE FOR A LONG TIME AS LONG AS I CAN
hb1ENFQrnYU_30 0 AND THEN I CHANGE HANDS BECAUSE ITS IMPORTANT TO DO THE SAME THING WITH YOUR LEFT HAND
hb1ENFQrnYU_31 0 NOW I HAVE MY OUTSIDE CIRCLE WHICH IS GOING FROM INSIDE TO OUTSIDE
hb1ENFQrnYU_32 0 AND NOW I CHANGE DIRECTION TO GO FROM OUTSIDE TO INSIDE
gKYLZcQUaJI_1 0 HI I'M MARK EMILEY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gKYLZcQUaJI_2 0 IN THIS NEXT SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON OUR FERMENTATION PROCESSES
gKYLZcQUaJI_3 0 NOW THAT WE'VE GOT OUR BEER ALL READY WE'RE GOING TO START WORRYING ABOUT OUR FERMENTATION
gKYLZcQUaJI_4 0 SO FOR ALES WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO KEEP THE FERMENTATION TEMPERATURE BETWEEN SIXTY AND SEVENTY DEGREES
gKYLZcQUaJI_5 0 YOU CAN GO ON THE HIGHER END FOR SOME OF THE HIGHER STRENGTH BEERS LIKE THE IPAS AND ALSO FOR THE WHEAT S WHICH WILL PULL OUT A LITTLE MORE OF THE INTERESTING PHENOLICS
gKYLZcQUaJI_6 0 FOR LAGERS SUCH AS A BOCK OR A PILSNER WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO GO AS COLD AS WE CAN WHICH MEANS WE WANT TO HIT OR AIM FOR FIFTY DEGREES
gKYLZcQUaJI_7 0 SO WITH THIS YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO TAKE YOUR BUCKET PUT IT INTO A NICE RELATIVELY COOL DARK PLACE IN YOUR HOUSE AND LET'S START OUR PRIMARY FERMENTATION
gKYLZcQUaJI_8 0 IN ABOUT TWENTY-FOUR TO FORTY-EIGHT HOURS YOU SHOULD START TO SEE YOUR AIRLOCK BUBBLE A FAIR AMOUNT
gKYLZcQUaJI_9 0 IN ABOUT THREE DAYS YOUR BUBBLING SHOULD BE VERY VERY VIGOROUS MAYBE EVEN ONCE EVERY SECOND OR MAYBE ONCE EVERY TWO OR THREE SECONDS
gKYLZcQUaJI_10 0 AFTER THAT IT'S GOING TO START SLOWING DOWN
gKYLZcQUaJI_11 0 ONCE IT HITS ABOUT ONE BUBBLE EVERY SIX SECONDS YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GO THROUGH YOUR FIRST RACKING OPERATION WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN A LATER SEGMENT
gKYLZcQUaJI_12 0 ONCE YOU'VE DONE YOUR FIRST RACKING OPERATION THE BUBBLING IS GOING TO GO DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY
gKYLZcQUaJI_13 0 OKAY AT THIS POINT IT'S GOING TO BE GOING INTO YOUR SECOND FERMENTATION
gKYLZcQUaJI_14 0 ALL THE YEAST IS GOING TO BE FALLING OUT OF THE SOLUTION KIND OF REGIMENTING DOWN AT THE BOTTOM AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A NICE CLEAN BEER
gKYLZcQUaJI_15 0 IF YOU DID BUY A HYDROMETER YOU CAN TRACK THE PROGRESS OF YOUR FERMENTATION A LOT WITH THIS
gKYLZcQUaJI_16 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO START WITH YOUR INITIAL HYDROMETER READING THEN IN ABOUT FIVE OR SIX DAYS OKAY WHEN YOUR PRIMARY FERMENTATION IS DONE YOU SHOULD BE DOWN TO ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF WHAT YOUR INITIAL HYDROMETER READING WAS
gKYLZcQUaJI_17 0 SO IF YOU WERE STARTING AT TEN FIFTY THAT WOULD MEAN YOU'D BE ABOUT TEN FIFTEEN
gKYLZcQUaJI_18 0 AT THAT POINT YOU'RE GOING TO SIPHON
gKYLZcQUaJI_19 0 AND THEN AFTER THAT YOU'RE GOING TO KIND OF WATCH YOUR SECONDARY FERMENTATION
gKYLZcQUaJI_20 0 IT MAY DROP DOWN A COUPLE MORE POINTS
gKYLZcQUaJI_21 0 IT MAY GET DOWN TO TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT OF WHAT YOU STARTED AT
gKYLZcQUaJI_22 0 IF YOU GET TO THAT POINT YOU'RE IN GOOD SHAPE
gKYLZcQUaJI_23 0 EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T YOU STILL MAY BE OKAY AS LONG AS IT'S NOT STILL BUBBLING
gKYLZcQUaJI_24 0 AND IF YOU'RE LOWER YOU'RE STILL GOOD

GZciXriOPi8_1 0 SO THE CHAKRAS ARE A POWERFUL TOOL FOR MEDITATION
GZciXriOPi8_2 0 YOU CAN USE THEM AS SORT OF AN INNER VISUAL TO FOCUS ENERGY FLOWS IN YOUR BODY
GZciXriOPi8_3 0 YOU HAVE SEVEN CHAKRAS OR ENERGETIC POINTS WITHIN THE BODY

guii9ME8o8M_1 0 SOMEONE OWES YOU MONEY AND YOU WANT TO COLLECT IT
guii9ME8o8M_2 0 HI I'M ROBERT TODD AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION HOW DO I WRITE A DEMAND LETTER
guii9ME8o8M_3 0 WELL FIRST OF ALL IT'S VERY SMART TO WRITE A DEMAND LETTER BEFORE YOU GO OUT AND FILE LEGAL ACTION OR YOU HIRE AN ATTORNEY TO PURSUE A COLLECTION FOR YOU
guii9ME8o8M_4 0 THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS OF COURSE DIRECT YOUR DEMAND LETTER TO THE INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY WHO OWES YOU THE MONEY
guii9ME8o8M_5 0 YOU WANT TO BE SURE AND SPECIFY EXACTLY WHAT EVENTS TRANSPIRED THAT BROUGHT ABOUT THIS INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY OWING YOU MONEY
guii9ME8o8M_6 0 YOU WANT TO DO THE DATES IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER SO THAT INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY CAN FOLLOW EXACTLY WHAT OCCURRED LEADING UP TO THE MONEY BEING OWED
guii9ME8o8M_7 0 YOU WANT TO IDENTIFY HOW YOU CALCULATED THE DAMAGES OR EXPENSES THAT YOU'RE SEEKING COLLECTION FOR
guii9ME8o8M_8 0 AND YOU WANT TO GIVE SOME KIND OF DEADLINE FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY WITHIN WHICH TIME TO RESPOND BECAUSE IT WILL PUT SOME PRESSURE ON THEM TO RESPOND TO THE DEMAND
guii9ME8o8M_9 0 ONCE THAT'S DONE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS ADDRESSED TO THE PARTY OR ENTITY THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED TO AND THEN SEND IT OUT
guii9ME8o8M_10 0 GOOD LUCK COLLECTING

hFih1w1O68o_9 0 BALLOON THAT SOMEONE COULD LOOK AT THROUGH THE HOLE
hFih1w1O68o_10 0 WHAT YOU'LL NEED IS JUST A REGULAR SHEET OF PAPER
hFih1w1O68o_11 0 THIS IS AN EIGHT 1/2 BY ELEVEN SHEET AND WE'RE GOING TO CUT IT INTO A SQUARE
hFih1w1O68o_12 0 YOU CAN MAKE THE PAPER BALLOON OUT OF ANY PIECE OF PAPER THAT IS A SQUARE AND IT WILL JUST COME OUT DIFFERENT SIZES DEPENDING ON WHAT SIZE YOU USE
hFih1w1O68o_13 0 WE'RE USING AN EIGHT 1/2 BY ELEVEN SHEET
hFih1w1O68o_14 0 YOU'LL WANT SOME NICE MARKERS OR COLORS TO DO SOME DRAWING INSIDE AND A PAIR OF SCISSORS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A SQUARE PIECE OF PAPER
hFih1w1O68o_15 0 THE FIRST THING WE'LL DO IS MAKE OUR PAPER SQUARE
hFih1w1O68o_16 0 YOU CAN EITHER USE A PAPER CUTTER OR I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS SQUARE BY FOLDING IT DIAGONALLY RIGHT TO THE POINT OVER ON THIS SIDE AND MATCH THE EDGES EXACTLY TO HERE AND THEN JUST FOLD THAT RIGHT IN HALF
hFih1w1O68o_17 0 AT THIS POINT YOU CAN EITHER FOLD IT UP LIKE THIS CREASE IT AND CUT ALONG THAT CREASE OR TAKE A PENCIL AND JUST RUN IT ALONG THE EDGE OF THE PAPER LIKE THAT
hFih1w1O68o_18 0 THAT'S YOUR CUTTING LINE AND WE'LL CUT THAT IN HALF AND THAT WILL GIVE US A SQUARE PIECE OF PAPER
HdAfGC2PaDY_1 0 WHAT ANOTHER GREAT DAY TO LEARN HOW TO SNOWBOARD
HdAfGC2PaDY_2 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS A ONE FOOT IN AND A TWO FOOT IN HEEL SLIDE
HdAfGC2PaDY_3 0 THIS IS A GREAT THING TO PRACTICE IF YOU'VE NEVER SNOWBOARDED BEFORE
HdAfGC2PaDY_4 0 GET IN AN AREA WHERE IT'S VERY VERY FLAT
HdAfGC2PaDY_5 0 JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A SLOPE
HdAfGC2PaDY_6 0 BUCKLE IN YOUR FRONT FOOT
HdAfGC2PaDY_7 0 DON'T FORGET TO HOOK UP YOUR LEASH
HdAfGC2PaDY_8 0 THEN YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR SECOND FOOT AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO SLIDE YOUR TOE UP ONTO THE BOARD JUST THE TOE OF MY FOOT ONTO THE BOARD
HdAfGC2PaDY_9 0 I'M GOING TO TILT THE BOARD DOWN
HdAfGC2PaDY_10 0 WHEN I TILT THE BOARD DOWN THEN I'M GOING TO DISENGAGE THE BACK EDGE OR RELEASE THE BACK EDGE
HdAfGC2PaDY_11 0 THE BOARD IS GOING TO SLIDE DOWN
HdAfGC2PaDY_12 0 WHEN I WANT TO STOP I'M GOING TO LIFT MY TOE UP AND THE BOARD WILL COME TO A STOP
HdAfGC2PaDY_13 0 NOW THIS IS A GREAT EXERCISE TO PRACTICE BEFORE YOU GET INTO A CLASS IN A NICE FLAT AREA
HdAfGC2PaDY_14 0 IT JUST GIVES YOU A GREAT HANDLE ON GETTING ON THE BOARD AND MAKING YOURSELF KNOW HOW IT FEELS
HdAfGC2PaDY_15 0 I'M GOING TO SLIDE MY FRONT FOOT UP ONTO THE BOARD AND I'M GOING TO PRESS MY TOES DOWN
HdAfGC2PaDY_16 0 LIFT UP TO STOP DOWN TO GO UP TO STOP
HdAfGC2PaDY_17 0 I'M GOING TO MAINTAIN MY REFERENCE ALIGNMENT
HdAfGC2PaDY_18 0 I'M GOING TO KEEP MY KNEES BENT
HdAfGC2PaDY_19 0 NOW THAT'S WILL ONE FOOT IN
HdAfGC2PaDY_20 0 THAT'S HOW YOU SHOULD START TO PRACTICE THIS SEGMENT
HdAfGC2PaDY_21 0 NOW UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR BOARD OFF NEVER SET YOUR BOARD DOWN ON THE BOTTOM OF THE DECK
HdAfGC2PaDY_22 0 ALWAYS FLIP YOUR BOARD UPSIDE DOWN ON THE ON THE SNOW
HdAfGC2PaDY_23 0 THAT WAY YOU'LL NEVER BE TAKING A LONG WALK DOWN THE HILL TO GET YOUR SNOWBOARD AND YOU'LL NEVER RISK ENDANGERING SOMEBODY ELSE ON THE MOUNTAIN
hcYJxvCIoAQ_1 0 WELCOME TO THE SEGMENT OF FACIAL YOGA CALLED THE SHIFTING FACE
hcYJxvCIoAQ_2 0 WHAT WE'RE FIRST GOING TO DO IS JUST RUBBED THE FINGERS TOGETHER
hcYJxvCIoAQ_3 0 I'M BORROWING THIS PART OF THE EXERCISE FROM THEATER TRAINING
hcYJxvCIoAQ_4 0 WE'RE THINKING THAT THE FACE IS MANY TIMES CALLED THE MASK
hcYJxvCIoAQ_5 0 AS WE RUB THE HANDS TOGETHER WE THEN PUT THEM ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND AS WE MOVE IN THE DIRECTION UP AND DOWN WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE ALL OF THE MUSCLES IN THE FACE
hcYJxvCIoAQ_6 0 SO TAKE IT NICE AND SLOW AND EASY
hcYJxvCIoAQ_7 0 WE FIRST THINK OF JUST TAKING A NICE BREATH RELAXING THE FACE COMPLETELY
hcYJxvCIoAQ_8 0 AS BEST AS POSSIBLE NOTHING GOING ON THERE'S NO EXPRESSION
hcYJxvCIoAQ_9 0 AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE EXPRESSION TO A DOWNWARD FACE
hcYJxvCIoAQ_10 0 SO GENTLY WE FEEL THAT THE EYEBROWS START TO DRAW DOWN
hcYJxvCIoAQ_11 0 THE FACE THE EYES LOOK DOWN THE JAW THE CHEEKS THE LIPS EVERYTHING LOOKING DOWNWARD
hcYJxvCIoAQ_12 0 SEE IF YOU CAN DRAW ALL OF THE ENERGY DOWN
hcYJxvCIoAQ_13 0 IF SOMEONE WALKS BY TO SEE YOU THEY MIGHT LAUGH AT YOU BUT THAT'S ALRIGHT
hcYJxvCIoAQ_14 0 STAY WITH THIS FEELING OF REALLY DRAWING THE ENERGY DOWN
hcYJxvCIoAQ_15 0 AND THEN HOLD IT FOR AS LONG AS YOU'RE COMFORTABLE
hcYJxvCIoAQ_16 0 RELEASE SLOWLY THE CHIN THE FACE THE LIPS THE JAW THE CHEEKBONE AND THEN AGAIN YOU'RE RETURNING TO NEUTRAL
hcYJxvCIoAQ_17 0 NEXT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE HANDS FROM THE RIGHT
hcYJxvCIoAQ_18 0 WE'RE GOING TO SLIDE THE FACE TO THE LEFT
hcYJxvCIoAQ_19 0 AGAIN IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE JUST MAKING FUNNY FACES
hcYJxvCIoAQ_20 0 HOWEVER YOU CAN DEEPEN THIS BY RECOGNIZING WHAT WE'RE REALLY SEEING IN OURSELVES IS OUR OWN NATURALNESS
hcYJxvCIoAQ_21 0 WE'RE EXPLORING JUST LIKE WE DO IN THE BODY HOW DOES THE FACE STRETCH
hcYJxvCIoAQ_22 0 AND WE'RE JUST SIMPLY GOING TO TAKE THE LINES OF ENERGY ALL THE WAY TO THE SIDE
hcYJxvCIoAQ_23 0 SO ITS AS IF THERE IS A FAST WIND OR SOMETHING DRAWING ALL THE ENERGY INCLUDING THE EYES TO THE SIDE
hcYJxvCIoAQ_24 0 REALLY HOLDING ALL OF THE ENERGY IN THE LOWER JAW
hcYJxvCIoAQ_25 0 THAT LOOKS MOST STRANGE THE FOREHEAD EVEN AND THEN GENTLY COME BACK TO NEUTRAL RELAX
hcYJxvCIoAQ_26 0 PROBABLY THE MOST AWARENESS HAPPENS WHEN YOU LET GO
GMc3DMZsVs4_1 0 SO THE NEXT STEP WE'RE GOING TO DO IS SUBSECTIONING AND SPRAYING
GMc3DMZsVs4_2 0 SUBSECTIONING IS ANOTHER WAY TO KEEP CONTROL OF THE CURLS YOU'LL BE WORKING ON
GMc3DMZsVs4_3 0 SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TAKE ABOUT A 1/4 SECTION SECTION THAT AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE SECTION AND YOU CAN LET THAT DROP CLIP THE SECTION BACK AGAIN
GMc3DMZsVs4_4 0 TAKE THAT 1/4 SECTION THAT YOU JUST PULLED OUT AND DROP THAT AND WITH YOUR LARGER SECTION CLIP THAT BACK
GMc3DMZsVs4_5 0 TAKE YOUR 1/4 SECTION AND JUST GIVE IT A LITTLE COMB THROUGH THE ENDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO TANGLES
GMc3DMZsVs4_6 0 THAT IS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH OUR HAIRSPRAY
GMc3DMZsVs4_7 0 NOW REMEMBER TO ALWAYS SPRAY AWAY FROM THE CLIENTS FACE
GMc3DMZsVs4_8 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO GET ANY HAIRSPRAY INTO THEIR EYES OR HAVE THEM INHALE IT SOME CLIENTS WEAR CONTACTS IT WILL GET INTO THEIR EYES AND IT'S VERY STICKY
GMc3DMZsVs4_9 0 ALWAYS REMEMBER YOU WANT TO HOLD THE HAIRSPRAY APPROXIMATELY SIX EIGHT AWAY FROM THE HAIR AND JUST GIVE A LIGHT SPRAY
GMc3DMZsVs4_10 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO SPRAY TOO MUCH
GMc3DMZsVs4_11 0 IT WILL MAKE IT WAY TOO STIFF WE STILL WANT TO WORK WITH THIS AND WORK WITH THE CURLS TOWARDS THE END WITH PLIABLE PASTE
GMc3DMZsVs4_12 0 SO KEEP IT VERY LIGHT YOU CAN SEE THIS SIDE IT'S VERY STIFF AND THIS SIDE IS VERY LIGHT IT'S STILL DOES HAVE PRODUCT IN IT
GMc3DMZsVs4_13 0 SO 1/4 SECTION SPRAY AWAY FROM THE FACE AND THEN WE CURL
Gf_kQsJIQrY_1 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO NEXT IS THE EYELINER
Gf_kQsJIQrY_2 0 THE TYPE OF EYELINER THAT I PREFER IS THE ONE THAT COMES IN A LITTLE JAR LIKE THIS AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT WET AND IT'S MORE OF THAT TARRY ONE THAT YOU WANT
Gf_kQsJIQrY_3 0 AND YOU PUT IT ON WITH A BRUSH THAT'S SPECIAL FOR EYE LINING
Gf_kQsJIQrY_4 0 IT'S A VERY VERY SMALL END VERY TIGHT AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE CONCEALER/FOUNDATION BRUSH BUT IN A MUCH SMALLER FORM THE WAY THE BRISTLES ARE MADE
Gf_kQsJIQrY_5 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU THAT YOU GET A GOOD AMOUNT ON THE TIP
Gf_kQsJIQrY_6 0 SOMETIMES I LIKE TO USE THE BACK OF MY HAND AS A PALETTE TO GET IN ON THERE NICE AND SMOOTHLY BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT IT CLUMPY NEITHER
Gf_kQsJIQrY_7 0 AND WHEN YOU PUT IT ON YOU WANT TO PUT IT AS CLOSE TO THE HAIRLINE THE EYELASH LINE AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY GET IT
Gf_kQsJIQrY_8 0 AND YOU WANT TO TRY TO GET IT IN A VERY THIN LINE YOU DON'T WANT IT TOO THICK
Gf_kQsJIQrY_9 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE IT VERY NATURAL LOOKING
Gf_kQsJIQrY_10 0 SO YOU WANT TO WORK YOUR WAY FROM WHATEVER AREA YOU PREFER
Gf_kQsJIQrY_11 0 I LIKE TO START IN THE CENTER AND WORK MY WAY OUT
Gf_kQsJIQrY_12 0 AND THEN WHERE I END WITH IT IS I END RIGHT WHERE THAT LAST EYELASH ENDS AT THE END OF MY EYE
Gf_kQsJIQrY_13 0 I DO NOT LIKE TO GO OUT BECAUSE WHEN YOU PULL YOUR EYELINER OUT IT ONLY EXTENDS THE EYE AND IT CLOSES IT
Gf_kQsJIQrY_14 0 WHEN YOU WANT TO MAKE YOUR EYES BIG AND MORE NOTICEABLE ON TV VERY IMPORTANT TO DO
Gf_kQsJIQrY_15 0 THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROCEDURES TO POP THOSE EYES OPEN
Gf_kQsJIQrY_16 0 I'M GETTING IT REALLY GOOD AT THE END AND WORKING IN A WAY I'M GETTING IT NEAR THAT EYELASH LINE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE AS THIN AS POSSIBLE
Gf_kQsJIQrY_17 0 AND DO THE SAME EXACT TO THE OPPOSITE EYE
gkKh74ECtLc_1 0 HI ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM I'M SHELLY HERE AT AA CALISTER IN SALT LAKE CITY UTAH AND I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU ONE OF THE POINTS ABOUT PUTTING ON AND TAKING OFF A CLOSE-FRONT WINTER HORSE BLANKET
gkKh74ECtLc_2 0 NOW THE FIRST COUPLE TIMES YOU PUT ON OR TAKE OFF YOUR WINTER HORSE BLANKET THIS IS RUDY HERE AND HE'S ALWAYS GOOD TO STAND BUT YOUR HORSE PROBABLY WON'T BE AND IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO FRIGHTEN THEM A LITTLE BIT WHEN SOMETHING GOES ON OVER THEIR EYES AND OVER THEIR HEAD
gkKh74ECtLc_3 0 ONCE THEY GET USED TO IT MOST HORSES WILL BECOME ACCLIMATED AND IT DOESN'T GIVE THEM A PROBLEM
gkKh74ECtLc_4 0 SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS PRETEND THAT RUDY IS TIED UP AND WE'VE UNTIED RUDY BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT WILL SCARE THEM AND THEY WILL PULL BACK
gkKh74ECtLc_5 0 WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE THEM TIED UP SO THAT THEY CAN KIND OF GET AWAY FROM US
gkKh74ECtLc_6 0 NOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS RUN THE LEAD ROPE THROUGH YOUR HANDS SO THAT YOU HAVE A HOLD OF YOUR HORSE AND THEN SLIP THE BLANKET OVER HIS MUZZLE UP OVER HIS EYES AND OVER HIS EARS
gkKh74ECtLc_7 0 NOW I'VE STILL GOT MY HALTER LEAD ROPE RIGHT HERE SO THAT IF HE DOES GET TOO SCARED I STILL HAVE A HOLD OF HIM
gkKh74ECtLc_8 0 NOW IF YOU WANT TO TIE YOUR HORSE UP YOU WOULD DO SO NOW BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE JUST LIKE A REGULAR BLANKET PUTTING IT ON THE REST OF THE TIME
gkKh74ECtLc_9 0 THROW IT OVER HIS BACK JUST LIKE A CLOSED FRONT BLANKET AND IT'S READY TO GO
gkKh74ECtLc_10 0 NO BUCKLES TO DO IN THE FRONT BECAUSE IT'S A CLOSED FRONT
gkKh74ECtLc_11 0 THIS ONE IS A TWO SURGICAL BLANKET HERE THAT CRISSCROSSES SO WE'LL DO THOSE UP FOR HIM
gkKh74ECtLc_12 0 IT ALSO HAS THE TAIL STRAP AT THE BACK AND THE LEG STRAPS
gkKh74ECtLc_13 0 SO WE'LL UNDO THE LEG STRAPS FOR HIM
gkKh74ECtLc_14 0 THIS ONE HAS DETACHABLE LEGS STRAPS
gkKh74ECtLc_15 0 YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY WILL DETACH FROM BOTH SIDES BECAUSE YOUR HORSE MIGHT NOT NEED THEM
gkKh74ECtLc_16 0 DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH YOUR HORSE RUNS AROUND HOW WILD HE IS
gkKh74ECtLc_17 0 IF HE'S PRETTY MELLOW A LOT OF TIMES YOU DON'T EVEN NEED THE BACK STRAPS
gkKh74ECtLc_18 0 THERE JUST HERE TO HELP KEEP THE BLANKET FROM GETTING TOO SHIFTED DURING HIS MOVEMENT AND RUN AROUND
gkKh74ECtLc_19 0 SO THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GOING TO PUT ON THE HORSE BLANKET THE CLOSED FRONT
gkKh74ECtLc_20 0 TO TAKE IT OFF WE JUST GOING TO UNDO THE LEG STRAPS UNDO THE BELLY STRAPS PULL TO THE SIDE
gkKh74ECtLc_21 0 I'M GOING TO GRAB A HOLD OF RUDY'S LEAD ROPE HERE BUT I DON'T WANT TO TIE HIM UP
gkKh74ECtLc_22 0 PULL IT OFF OVER HIS HEAD AND I STILL HAVE A HOLD OF HIM
gkKh74ECtLc_23 0 THIS IS HOW YOU TAKE OFF A CLOSED FRONT BLANKET
hK0jBWEejLQ_2 0 SO THE NEXT THING WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT NOW THAT WE HAVE OUR SAND BOA AND OUR SETUP IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO FEED THE SAND BOA

GXOKugPo23g_2 0 THE SHOULDER ITSELF CAN ACTUALLY MOVE IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT RANGES OF MOTION AT THE SAME TIME AND THAT MOTION LENDS THE SHOULDER TO INJURY MORE SUSCEPTIBLY THAN SAY TO A KNEE OR A WRIST OR AN ELBOW WHICH HAS MORE OF A BONY ATTACHMENT AND STRONGER LIGAMENTS
GXOKugPo23g_3 0 WE LOOK AT THE MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER AS A PRIMARY ATTACHMENT TO THE MUSCLES OF THE SKELETAL SYSTEM
GXOKugPo23g_4 0 IF THESE MUSCLES ARE IN SPASMS IT IS NOT GOING TO LET THE SHOULDER MOVE LIKE IT IS SUPPOSED TO AND THAT LACK OF MOVEMENT CAN LEND ITSELF TO INJURIES OVER USE STRAINS AND THE LIST IS ENDLESS OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN WITH THE SHOULDER ESPECIALLY WITH ALL THE SPORTS THAT THE SHOULDER IS INVOLVED WITH SO IT IS IMPERATIVE TO MAKE SURE THE MUSCULAR ATTACHMENTS OF THE SHOULDER ARE WORKING LIKE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO AND IN ADDITION TO MAKING SURE THAT THE JOINTS OF THE SHOULDER ARE WORKING LIKE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO
GXOKugPo23g_5 0 ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I GOT INTO CHIROPRACTICS WAS THAT IT ACTUALLY SAVED MY SCHOLARSHIP AS I PLAYED BASKETBALL IN UNDERGRAD
GXOKugPo23g_6 0 I HAD HURT MY LOW BACK PLAYING BASKETBALL IN PRACTICE AND HAD BEEN OUT FOR OVER THIRTY DAYS
GXOKugPo23g_7 0 NOW I TRIED THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH OF MEDICINE DOING DRUGS AND REHAB AND DOING REST BUT NONE OF THAT HELPED UNTIL I ACTUALLY WAS TALKED INTO GOING TO VISIT A CHIROPRACTOR
GXOKugPo23g_8 0 AFTER A VISIT WITH THE CHIROPRACTOR SHE EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THE DISCS IN MY LOW BACK WERE A LITTLE BIT SWOLLEN SOME OF THE JOINTS HAD SOME ADDITIONAL INFLAMMATION AROUND THERE WHICH WERE CUTTING OFF SOME OF THE NERVE SUPPLY DOWN INTO MY LEGS AND I WAS ACTUALLY EXPERIENCING SOME NUMBNESS IN ADDITION TO THE LOW BACK PAIN NUMBNESS GOING DOWN MY LEGS AND AFTER JUST TWO TREATMENTS OF CHIROPRACTICS MY LOW BACK FELT 100 %PERCENT BETTER
GXOKugPo23g_9 0 I WAS ABLE TO GET BACK TO PLAYING AND NOT ONLY GET BACK TO PLAYING BUT SAVE MY SCHOLARSHIP SO THANK YOU CHIROPRACTICS
gyPD9wul4uQ_1 0 HI THIS IS TOM KENASTON
gyPD9wul4uQ_2 0 SINGER SONGWRITER PIANIST MUSIC DIRECTOR LIVING IN WEST PALM BEACH AND NEW YORK CITY
gyPD9wul4uQ_3 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO FIND A PIANO TEACHER
gyPD9wul4uQ_4 0 IT'S REALLY VERY EASY
gyPD9wul4uQ_5 0 THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO KNOW OR DETERMINE FOR YOURSELF IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
gyPD9wul4uQ_6 0 WHAT TYPE OF MUSIC YOU WANT TO PLAY AND HOW INTENSELY YOU WANT TO STUDY
gyPD9wul4uQ_7 0 IF YOU'RE MOSTLY INTERESTED IN POP MUSIC POP ROCK IMPROVISING THEN OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT TO FIND A TEACHER WHO IS PROFICIENT IN TEACHING THAT
gyPD9wul4uQ_8 0 I STUDIED CLASSICALLY
gyPD9wul4uQ_9 0 I STARTED IN FIRST GRADE WITH A CLASSICAL PIANO TEACHER
gyPD9wul4uQ_10 0 MY PARENTS LOOKED FOR A TEACHER BY ASKING OTHER FRIENDS OF THERE'S
gyPD9wul4uQ_11 0 A REFERRALS ALWAYS THE BEST THE BEST METHOD FOR FINDING A PIANO TEACHER
gyPD9wul4uQ_12 0 ASK AROUND PEOPLE YOU KNOW IF YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO PLAYS THE PIANO FIND OUT WHERE THEY LEARNED TO PLAY
gyPD9wul4uQ_13 0 YOU COULD ALSO CHECK IN THE YELLOW PAGES UNDER MUSIC SCHOOL
gyPD9wul4uQ_14 0 YOU COULD IF YOU HAVE A MUSIC TEACHER AT YOUR SCHOOL YOU COULD AS THERE OR IF YOU DON'T GO TO SCHOOL YOU GRADUATED IF YOU'RE AN ADULT YOU CAN LOOK UP ON THE WEB
gyPD9wul4uQ_15 0 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF RESOURCES ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS THE MUSIC TEACHER'S NATIONAL ASSOCIATION I BELIEVE IT'S MTNA.ORG
gyPD9wul4uQ_16 0 IT'S A GREAT RESOURCE AND THERE WILL BE A LINK ON THERE FOR FIND A MUSIC TEACHER IN YOUR AREA
gyPD9wul4uQ_17 0 AND YOU CAN DO A SEARCH BY STATE ZIP CODE ETC ETC
gyPD9wul4uQ_18 0 AND THOSE TEACHER'S HAVE BEEN CERTIFIED THEY'VE HAD TO GO THROUGH A SCREENING PROCESS AND PROVE THEMSELVES AS KNOWLEDGEABLE AND PROFICIENT
gyPD9wul4uQ_19 0 SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO START TODAY IF YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY THE PIANO FIND A TEACHER
gyPD9wul4uQ_20 0 TRY A COUPLE OF THEM OUT DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO STICK TO THE FIRST ONE YOU FIND
gyPD9wul4uQ_21 0 SEE IF YOU LIKE THEM PERSONALLY AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
gyPD9wul4uQ_22 0 THIS IS TOM KENASTON
gyPD9wul4uQ_23 0 THIS HAS BEEN A CLIP ON HOW TO FIND A PIANO TEACHER
GhhALfB_1Aw_1 0 OK THE NEXT FORM OF NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS SPACE AND SPACE IS SPACE
GhhALfB_1Aw_2 0 IT IS THE SPACE AROUND YOU
GhhALfB_1Aw_3 0 IT'S OFFICIALLY CALLED PROXEMICS AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE THREE SETS OF PROXEMICS AROUND US
GhhALfB_1Aw_4 0 WHAT THIS IS IS BASICALLY THE BUBBLE OR THE WALL IN WHICH YOU DON'T REALLY WANT ANYBODY IN THERE BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE THREE SETS OF WALLS
GhhALfB_1Aw_5 0 FIRST WE HAVE OUR SOCIAL DISTANCE
GhhALfB_1Aw_6 0 THAT'S WHERE OK I WANT TO ONLY KEEP YOU HERE BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY KNOW YOU
GhhALfB_1Aw_7 0 I'M NOT SUPER COMFORTABLE WITH YOU
GhhALfB_1Aw_8 0 NEXT WE HAVE THE PERSONAL SPACE WHICH I KNOW YOU
GhhALfB_1Aw_9 0 WE'RE DEVELOPING A RELATIONSHIP
GhhALfB_1Aw_11 0 I TRUST YOU SO I'M GOING TO LET YOU IN A LITTLE BIT CLOSER
GhhALfB_1Aw_12 0 AND THEN OF COURSE THE LAST SET OF SPACE IS THE INTIMATE DISTANCE WHICH IS VERY VERY VERY CLOSE
GhhALfB_1Aw_13 0 NOW IT IS SO INTERESTING BECAUSE AMERICANS HAVE THE LARGEST AREA OF PROXEMICS AROUND THEM COMPARED TO ANY OTHER CULTURE
GhhALfB_1Aw_14 0 WE DON'T LIKE PEOPLE UP CLOSE TO US WHERE OTHER CULTURES THEY GET RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER
GhhALfB_1Aw_15 0 IN FACT I BET THIS HAS HAPPENED TO YOU
GhhALfB_1Aw_16 0 YOU'RE STANDING IN LINE AT THE GROCERY STORE AND YOU CAN FEEL SOMEBODY RIGHT BEHIND YOU SO YOU STEP UP AND THEY STEP UP AND YOU STEP UP AND THEY STEP UP
GhhALfB_1Aw_17 0 IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND A LOT OF TIMES IT'S JUST SIMPLY A CULTURAL DIFFERENCE BUT WHAT THIS DOES IS THIS COMMUNICATES HOW WE FEEL
GhhALfB_1Aw_18 0 I'M COMFORTABLE WITH YOU
GhhALfB_1Aw_19 0 I'M GOING TO GET CLOSE TO YOU OR I AM NOT COMFORTABLE WITH YOU
GhhALfB_1Aw_20 0 I HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM YOU
GhhALfB_1Aw_21 0 SOME PEOPLE ARE INTUITIVE ENOUGH TO PICK UP ON THAT
GhhALfB_1Aw_22 0 SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THEIR OWN PROXEMICS
GhhALfB_1Aw_23 0 SOMEONE GETS RIGHT ON YOU
GhhALfB_1Aw_24 0 YOU STEP BACK
GhhALfB_1Aw_25 0 THEY STEP IN
GhhALfB_1Aw_26 0 VERY CLEARLY THE SPACE AROUND THEM IS NOT AS DEEP AS THE SPACE AROUND YOU SO BE VERY AWARE OF PEOPLE'S SPACE
gC60UjILVDU_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT I JUST WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ANGLING THE SOFT BOX
gC60UjILVDU_2 0 A LOT OF TIMES I TEND TO USE MY SOFT BOX PRETTY WELL PARALLEL TO THE SUBJECT
gC60UjILVDU_3 0 BUT YOU CAN POINT IT IN TOO AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT ILLUMINATES THE BACKGROUND A LITTLE BIT MORE
gC60UjILVDU_4 0 BUT IT ALSO PROVIDES A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTRAST ON ONE SIDE OF THE SUBJECT
gC60UjILVDU_5 0 THE SHADOWS TEND TO GET A LITTLE BIT STRONGER AROUND THE NOSE
gC60UjILVDU_6 0 BUT IT ALSO HELPS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE INSET WHOSE EYES ARE PRETTY WELL INSET AND I THINK IT TENDS TO WORK A LITTLE BETTER WITH WOMEN SOMETIMES
gC60UjILVDU_7 0 IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU JUST WANT TO PLAY AROUND
gC60UjILVDU_8 0 EACH SUBJECT IS DIFFERENT AND IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE YOU JUST KIND OF WANT TO MOVE YOUR LIGHT AROUND UNTIL YOU GET IT WHERE YOU WANT IT
gC60UjILVDU_9 0 AND THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS WHEN YOU'RE STARTING TO PLAY AROUND WITH THIS IS PLAY WITH IT A LOT
gC60UjILVDU_10 0 AND THEN YOU'LL START TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT
gC60UjILVDU_11 0 IN THIS SEGMENT I KIND OF WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT POSITIONING THE SOFT BOX
gC60UjILVDU_12 0 SOMETIMES IT LOOKS GREAT JUST TO HAVE IT KIND OF IF YOU SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A FASHION LOOK TO ALMOST HAVE IT PRETTY MUCH STRAIGHT IN YOU KNOW THEN YOU'RE JUST KIND OF PEEKING AROUND THE SIDE TO GET THE SHOT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
gC60UjILVDU_13 0 THE NICE THING ABOUT THE SOFT BOX IS YOU CAN ILLUMINATE THE BACKGROUND ALSO AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT A BIG STRONG SHADOW
gLSz05-vNHw_1 0 A CUSTOMER HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT COUGHING AND NOT IDLING RIGHT AND RUNNING ROUGH
gLSz05-vNHw_2 0 WE CHANGED THE MANIFOLD GASKETS
gLSz05-vNHw_3 0 WE CHANGED THE SEAL AROUND THE CARBURETOR AND JUDGING FROM HOW DRY THE OLD MANIFOLD CASKETS WERE HE SHOULD NOTICE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS BIKE
gLSz05-vNHw_4 0 THE ENGINE WON'T RUN AS HOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT SUCKING IN AIR FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND IT'LL RUN A LOT BETTER
gLSz05-vNHw_5 0 AFTER WE GOT THE SEAT AND EVERYTHING ON WE CHECKED THE CHARGING SYSTEM WHILE WE WERE THERE
gLSz05-vNHw_6 0 STARTED UP THE BIKE HIS CHARGING SYSTEM IS WORKING
gLSz05-vNHw_7 0 HIS BATTERY HAD A GOOD CHARGE ON IT
gLSz05-vNHw_8 0 WE DID AN OVERALL ON THE BIKE WHICH IS WHAT YOU SHOULD ALWAYS DO CHECK YOUR RUNNING LIGHTS YOUR TURN SIGNALS YOUR HIGH AND LOW BEAM YOUR BRAKE LIGHTS ON THE HAND LEVER AND THE FOOT LEVER
gLSz05-vNHw_9 0 HE HAD ALL AROUND THE BIKE'S IN GOOD SHAPE AND IT'S GOING TO RUN A LOT BETTER NOW WITH THESE NEW SEALS IN IT
gLSz05-vNHw_10 0 I'M SURE YOU'LL BE REALLY HAPPY WITH IT AND IF YOUR NOT COMFORTABLE WITH DOING IT YOURSELF BRING IT ON DOWN TO THE RIDE FACTORY IN YBOR CITY AND WE'LL GET HER HOOKED UP FOR YOU
gLSz05-vNHw_11 0 ALRIGHT SIR THANK YOU

ggGAPOuYQHY_1 0 PHIL CONROOD HI THIS IS PHIL CONROOD ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
ggGAPOuYQHY_2 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO BEAT CALL OF DUTY FOUR MODERN WARFARE
ggGAPOuYQHY_3 0 CALL OF DUTY FOUR MODERN WARFARE IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF ACTIVISION A COMPANY IN WHICH I HAVE NO AFFILIATION
ggGAPOuYQHY_4 0 FIRST TIME YOU GO THROUGH IT YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND YOUR WAY BUT IT'S PRETTY PRETTY DIRECT
ggGAPOuYQHY_5 0 I MEAN THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE WAY YOU CAN GO AND THERE'S THAT DOG I CAN'T STAND THOSE DOGS
ggGAPOuYQHY_6 0 BUT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO CROSS THE THRESHOLD OF THIS HALLWAY OR YOU WON'T ACTIVATE THE ENEMY YOU WON'T EVEN ACTIVATE THE DOG
ggGAPOuYQHY_7 0 SO I LIKE TO THROW A FLASH BANG IN HERE JUST TO STUN ANYBODY THAT MIGHT BE CHECKING US OUT
ggGAPOuYQHY_8 0 AND THAT DOG IS STILL IN HERE SOMEWHERE UNLESS CAPTAIN MACMILLAN TOOK CARE OF IT AND HE DIDN'T
ggGAPOuYQHY_9 0 THERE WE GO
ggGAPOuYQHY_10 0 YOU HAVE A VERY VERY TIGHT WINDOW
ggGAPOuYQHY_11 0 WHEN THAT DOG YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL HE'S BITING DOWN ON YOU AND YOU HAVE TO CLICK YOUR R-STICK DOWN JUST AT THE RIGHT MOMENT
ggGAPOuYQHY_12 0 I MEAN THE WINDOW THAT THEY GIVE YOU TO DO THAT IS SO SMALL
ggGAPOuYQHY_13 0 SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO KEEP MAKING OUR WAY AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH ANOTHER EVACUATED BUILDING
ggGAPOuYQHY_14 0 NONE OF THESE NOBODY LIVES IN THIS LITTLE TOWN ANYMORE AND YOU'LL ACTUALLY JUST GO THROUGH THIS BATHROOM AND WE'RE GOING TO GET UP TO THE OTHER SIDE HERE
ggGAPOuYQHY_15 0 EMPTY EVERYTHING EVERYBODY'S GONE
ggGAPOuYQHY_16 0 THEY MAKE THE COMMENT THERE WAS 50,000 LIVING IN THIS TOWN AT ONE POINT
GX_3fZ4lKyE_1 0 KATATE-TORI IF WE MISS THAT ONE WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO KOKINAGI

GX_3fZ4lKyE_3 0 THINK OF THIS VERY SOFT LOOSE UP AND OVER AND THEN DOWN
GX_3fZ4lKyE_4 0 MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ARM THOUGH
GX_3fZ4lKyE_5 0 SO YOU CAN ALWAYS GET ME HERE AS LONG AS I CAN GET IN I'M GOOD
GX_3fZ4lKyE_6 0 I WANT TO GET MY BODY MY BELT BEHIND HIS BELT
GX_3fZ4lKyE_7 0 IF I CAN RAISE THIS UP HERE GREAT THEN I CAN GRAB IT AND BRING IT DOWN
GX_3fZ4lKyE_8 0 NOT THAT BIG A DEAL
GX_3fZ4lKyE_9 0 UP AND ENTER THEN DOWN
GX_3fZ4lKyE_10 0 TRY TO GO GENTLY DOWN
GX_3fZ4lKyE_11 0 NOT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THE ELBOW OKAY
h3RfwqZVYiI_1 0 NOW REALIZING THAT YOU ARE ALREADY WORKING ON A FLAT SURFACE ON A TABLE SURFACE YOU STILL WANT TO MAINTAIN HAVING SOME SORT OF SEPARATE BOARD THAT YOU ARE WORKING ON INSTEAD OF LAYING YOUR PIECE DIRECTLY DOWN ON TO YOUR TABLE TO PROTECT YOUR SURFACE
h3RfwqZVYiI_2 0 I TEND TO USE BIRCH WOOD BOARD IT'S JUST THE THING THAT I PREFER IT'S STRONG ENOUGH STURDY ENOUGH CREATES A NICE DRAWING BOARD SURFACE
h3RfwqZVYiI_3 0 YOU CAN USE ANY OTHER TYPE OF BOARD THAT YOU FEEL MOST COMFORTABLE WITH
h3RfwqZVYiI_4 0 THEY DO SELL CLIP BOARDS AT ART SUPPLY STORES THAT HAVE THE LITTLE CLIP UP AT THE TOP THAT YOU CAN STICK THE PIECE ONTO IT'S UP TO YOU
h3RfwqZVYiI_5 0 I TEND TO FIND THAT THESE WORK JUST AS WELL BECAUSE WE END UP ACTUALLY TAPING AS YOU CAN SEE THE PIECE DOWN TO THE BOARD
h3RfwqZVYiI_6 0 AND THEN YOU ALSO WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER WORKING BOARD THAT'S A PIECE OF WOOD SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM THAT YOU CAN CUT ON TO
h3RfwqZVYiI_7 0 YOU NEVER WANT TO CUT DIRECTLY ONTO YOUR TABLE SURFACE AS YOU'LL BE PUTTING CUTS RIGHT INTO YOUR TABLE UNLESS THE TABLE SURFACE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WORK SPECIFICALLY ON IN THAT FASHION AND THAT DOESN'T MATTER TO YOU
h3RfwqZVYiI_8 0 SO I TEND TO USE A SCRAP BOARD THIS IS CALLED THE WAND BUT AGAIN YOU CAN USE THE BRISTLE BOARD OR ANYTHING THAT WORKS WELL FOR A CUTTING SURFACE

G_leenn4ZPM_1 0 HEY MY NAME IS ADDISON FROM CAPTAIN BILL'S
G_leenn4ZPM_2 0 I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO KEEP SCORE IN VOLLEYBALL
G_leenn4ZPM_3 0 THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN KEEP SCORE IN VOLLEYBALL
G_leenn4ZPM_4 0 THE FIRST WAY IS CALLED TRADITIONAL OR SIDE OUT SCORING
G_leenn4ZPM_5 0 AND WHEN USING THIS TYPE OF SCORING THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A POINT IS WHEN YOU SERVE THE BALL
G_leenn4ZPM_6 0 SO IF MY TEAM WERE TO SERVE THE BALL AND WE GET AN IN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE COURT WE GET IT IN THE SQUARE AND ON THE GROUND WE GET A POINT
G_leenn4ZPM_7 0 HOWEVER IF THE OTHER TEAM SERVES AND WE HIT IT OUT OR THEY HIT IT IN OUR SQUARE THEY GET THE POINT
G_leenn4ZPM_8 0 THE ONLY WAY IN TRADITIONAL OR SIDE OUT SCORING YOU CAN GET A POINT IS IF YOU SERVE THE BALL
G_leenn4ZPM_9 0 TYPICALLY IN TRADITIONAL OR SIDE OUT SCORING THE GAME GOES TO FIFTEEN OR ELEVEN
G_leenn4ZPM_10 0 THE OTHER TYPE OF SCORING IS RALLY SCORING
G_leenn4ZPM_11 0 RALLY SCORING IS WHERE EVERY SERVE IS A POINT
G_leenn4ZPM_12 0 SO IF MY TEAM SERVES THE BALL BUT YET THE OTHER TEAM GETS THE BALL AND PUTS IT INTO OUR SIDE OF THE COURT THEY GET THE POINT EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T SERVE THE BALL AND VICE VERSA
G_leenn4ZPM_13 0 RALLY SCORING USUALLY GOES TO 21 25 OR THIRTY
G_leenn4ZPM_14 0 AND THAT'S HOW YOU KEEP SCORE IN VOLLEYBALL
gwXiVX3GwN4_1 0 FIRST STRIKE IS A KEYWORD CREATURE ABILITY
gwXiVX3GwN4_2 0 HERE ON A CARD CALLED MOSQUITO GUARD YOU WILL SEE THAT IS SAYS FIRST STRIKE
gwXiVX3GwN4_3 0 IT WILL BE THE REINFORCE ONE FOR NOW THAT WILL BE ANOTHER LESSON
gwXiVX3GwN4_4 0 WHAT FIRST STRIKE MEANS IS THAT WHEN TWO CREATURES FIGHT THE FIRST STRIKE CREATURE DEALS ITS DAMAGE BEFORE THE OTHER CREATURE GETS TO FIGHT BACK
gwXiVX3GwN4_5 0 IN THIS CASE THE MOSQUITO GUARD EVEN THOUGH IT IS ONLY A ONE ONE CAN DEFEAT THE CRESTED CRAGHORN BECAUSE ITS TOUGHNESS IS ONLY ONE
gwXiVX3GwN4_6 0 IF THERE IS A CREATURE WITH FIRST STRIKE INVOLVED IN COMBAT THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL COMBAT DAMAGE STEP JUST FOR FIRST STRIKERS AND ONLY CREATURES THAT SURVIVE THE FIRST STRIKE COMBAT DAMAGE STEP ARE ALLOWED TO DEAL THEIR DAMAGE IN RETURN
gwXiVX3GwN4_7 0 THE MOSQUITO GUARD WILL KILL THE CRESTED CRAGHORN BY DEALING ONE POINT OF FIRST STRIKE DAMAGE
gwXiVX3GwN4_8 0 AND THE MOSQUITO GUARD SURVIVES WITHOUT TAKING THE FOUR DAMAGE THAT THE CRESTED CRAGHORN WOULD DEAL
glC40wsPJco_1 0 COMPUHOST COMPUTERIZED KARAOKE HOSTING SOLUTION IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF INVICION SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS
glC40wsPJco_2 0 AND I AM IN NO WAY AFFILIATED WITH INVICION SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS
glC40wsPJco_3 0 OKAY IN THIS NEXT CLIP I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE AVERAGE PERFORMANCE TIME
glC40wsPJco_4 0 THIS IS A GREAT TOOL BECAUSE AS YOU HAVE YOUR EVALUATED SCREEN IT WILL ACTUALLY TELL THE UPCOMING PERFORMANCES
glC40wsPJco_5 0 BUT WHAT'S GREAT IT WILL TELL TO BE ABLE TO TELL A PERSON WHAT TIME THEY'RE COMING
glC40wsPJco_6 0 I KNOW ON HAND PRETTY MUCH EVERY SONG IS ABOUT THREE TO FOUR MINUTES
glC40wsPJco_7 0 SO IF YOU SET YOUR AVERAGE TIME PERFORMANCE OR PERFORMANCE TIME IS FOUR MINUTES THAT MEANS BETWEEN EACH SINGER THERE'S A FOUR MINUTE GAP
glC40wsPJco_8 0 SO IF HEATHER'S SINGING AND SHE COMES IN AT SEVEN FIFTEEN AND SEVEN NINETEEN SHE'S GOING TO START I KNOW IN FOUR MINUTES JOHN IS GOING TO BE UP AFTER THAT
glC40wsPJco_9 0 AND RICHARD'S GOING TO BE UP
glC40wsPJco_10 0 BUT IF YOU HAVE TWENTY THIRTY PEOPLE YOU COULD ACTUALLY GO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM AND GIVE THEM AN IDEA
glC40wsPJco_11 0 YEA YOU AREN T GOING TO BE GETTING UP FOR ANOTHER HALF AN HOUR
glC40wsPJco_12 0 AND IT GIVES PEOPLE A CHANCE TO GO MINGLE OR GO TO THE BATHROOM OR DO WHATEVER
glC40wsPJco_13 0 IT'S JUST A REALLY GOOD FEATURE TO HAVE BECAUSE PEOPLE LOVE TO KNOW WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO SING NEXT IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT
glC40wsPJco_14 0 AND IT ELIMINATES YOU AS THE KJ HAVING TO HEAR ONE OF THE DREADED THINGS THAT WE HATE HEARING ALL NIGHT LONG IS WHEN PEOPLE KEEP COMING UP AND SAY WELL WHEN AM I NEXT
glC40wsPJco_15 0 NOW YOU CAN GIVE THEM A CLEAR PRECISE TIME AS TO WHEN THEY'RE COMING UP
glC40wsPJco_16 0 RIGHT NEXT TO IT IS YOUR REFRESH BUTTON
glC40wsPJco_17 0 SO IF YOU JUST WANT TO REFRESH YOUR SINGERS YOU CAN JUST DO THAT AND REFRESH IT AND CHANGE IT TO WHATEVER YOU FEEL MIGHT BE THE CASE
glC40wsPJco_18 0 I LIKE FOUR MINUTES AS A STANDARD TIME BETWEEN EACH SONG
Gx8J85hxM_g_1 0 HI I AM CANDI CANE-CANNCEL WITH EXPERT VILLAGE

Gx8J85hxM_g_18 0 WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT AFTER
_gjj9cqkNe8_1 0 BRIAN MONTGOMERY OKAY
_gjj9cqkNe8_2 0 SO WE'VE CUT THE BASS TRACK
_gjj9cqkNe8_3 0 JUST GO AHEAD AND REWIND THE TAPE AND GET IT READY TO PLAY IT BACK AND SEE HOW IT SOUNDS WITH THE RHYTHM GUITAR TRACK
_gjj9cqkNe8_4 0 WE GET TO ZERO THERE OKAY
_gjj9cqkNe8_5 0 SO WE STOP
_gjj9cqkNe8_6 0 THE FIRST THING AFTER THAT JUST GET OUR CHANNEL BACK IN TO THE LISTENING MODE SO WE'LL TAKE THAT INDICATOR SWITCH FROM THE RIGHT AND MOVE IT TO THE SAFE MODE
_gjj9cqkNe8_7 0 TAKE THE GUITAR INDICATOR MOVE THAT UP TO THE TAPE MODE
_gjj9cqkNe8_8 0 WE CAN LEAVE THE FADER WHERE IT IS
_gjj9cqkNe8_9 0 THE OTHER THING WE CAN DO IS THE TRIM ON THE BACK WHERE THE BASS WAS PLUGGED IN TO GO AHEAD AND JUST BRING THAT BACK DOWN TO NOTHING JUST IN CASE WHEN YOU GO TO DO SOMETHING ELSE LATER YOU DON'T HAVE A HIGH LEVEL DAMAGE YOUR EARS OR SOMETHING
_gjj9cqkNe8_10 0 AND NOW WE'RE PRETTY MUCH READY TO LISTEN BACK
H5z-K-iZF2s_1 0 THIS TYPE OF OPENING IS CALLED A HEART-SHAPED OPENING WITH FACING WHICH MEANS IT HAS A CLEAN FINISH
H5z-K-iZF2s_2 0 THE HEART COMES FROM THE FACT THAT THIS IS SHAPED AS A HEART
H5z-K-iZF2s_3 0 IF WE WERE GOING TO DO A REAL HEART THERE'S WHERE WE TAKE THE HEART FROM
H5z-K-iZF2s_4 0 BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD LOOK STUPID SO UNLESS YOU'VE GOT A LIKING FOR HEARTS IN GENERAL DON'T BOTHER
H5z-K-iZF2s_5 0 TAKE THE BOTTOM OF IT AND CURVE OUT THE EDGES AND CURVE IT IN AND CURVE IT IN KIND OF LIKE YOUR SCALLOPING IT OR LIKE A SWEETHEART NECKLINE BUT IT'S HEART-SHAPED
H5z-K-iZF2s_6 0 AND THEN THE FACT THAT IT'S WITH FACING MEANS THAT THIS LINE OF YOUR NECK THEN BECOMES THE STITCH LINE FOR A PIECE MIRRORING THIS TO BE PLACED ON TOP RIGHT SIDE TO RIGHT SIDE STITCHED ALONG THE HEART AND THEN FLIPPED INSIDE OUT FLIPPED INTO THE INTERIOR OF IT AND THEN IRONED ALONG THIS LINE WHICH JUST ALLOWS FOR A CLEAN FINISH AND ALLOWS FOR THE SHAPE TO BE RETAINED WITHOUT STRETCHING OUT THE FABRIC
HB3IofSaLx0_1 0 HI I'M ANN MYRICK AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT DECORATING YOUR BOOK CASE
HB3IofSaLx0_2 0 I REALLY LOVE BOOKS IN A BOOK CASE
HB3IofSaLx0_3 0 I AM A DECORATOR AND I LOVE DOING UNPREDICTABLE THINGS BUT I REALLY LIKE THE WEIGHT OF BOOKS IN A BOOK CASE SO A LOT OF THE TIPS THAT I WILL SHOW YOU AS FAR AS WORKING WITH BOOK CASES WE'LL BE USING BOOKS WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS NO MATTER HOW DEEP YOUR BOOK CASE IS I LIKE TO BRING THE BOOKS FORWARD SO IT LOOKS REALLY FULL AND I USUALLY BRING THE BOOKS FORWARD TO RIGHT TO THE EDGE OF THE SHELF AND THEN I LIKE USING LIKE SIZES
HB3IofSaLx0_4 0 I LIKE DISTRIBUTING THE COLORS AND I DON'T WANT ALL REDS TOGETHER I DON'T WANT ALL YELLOWS TOGETHER
HB3IofSaLx0_5 0 I PREFER USING OLD BOOK CASES I MEAN I'M SORRY I PREFER USING OLD BOOKS BUT A LOT OR MOST PEOPLE HAVE THE NEW BOOKS BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE READING AND SO WHAT I DID IS I PRETTY MUCH PUT BOOKS IN THIS BOOK CASE AND THEN I ONCE IN A WHILE I PUT A NEAT ACCESSORY OR A FUN ACCESSORY IN IT
HB3IofSaLx0_6 0 NOW A LOT OF TIMES WHAT PEOPLE WILL DO IS THEY'LL PUT A LOT OF LITTLE ACCESSORIES IN A BOOK CASE WHICH REALLY GETS LOST AND SO YOU REALLY NEED IF YOU ARE GOING TO DECORATE WITH ACCESSORIES YOU NEED TO DO ONE BIG PIECE SO WE HAVE BOOKS AND ONE BIG PIECE
HB3IofSaLx0_7 0 WE HAVE BOOKS AND WHAT I DID IS I STAGGERED SO THE VASE IS OVER HERE AND SO I PUT THIS BIG SILVER PIECE THAT IS LOADED WITH PENS AND PENCILS OVER HERE SO I KIND OF STAGGERED
HB3IofSaLx0_8 0 HERE I KIND OF STARTED NOT HAVING MANY BOOKS AND SO A LOT OF TIMES I DON'T DO THIS I REALLY CONTINUE LIKE IN BOOKS BUT I USED BIG PIECES AND I JUST TRIED TO MAKE IT INTERESTING OLD FAMILY BASKETS WITH A PICTURE IN IT RUSTED GARDEN PIECE THAT I BROUGHT IN BUT YOU WILL SEE THAT I HAVE MOSTLY BIGGER PIECES IN HERE
HB3IofSaLx0_9 0 I HAVE ONE PIECE I LOVE USING THE CHILDRENS ARTS AND CRAFTS THAT THEY DID IN SCHOOL AND SO YOU'LL SEE THAT THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK CASE I HAVE A FEW OF THE ART PIECES THAT MY CHILD MADE AND BRING IN THOSE FUN PIECES LIKE PIPES AND SPECTACLES AND JUST USE THOSE ALSO BUT MAKE YOUR BOOK CASES INTERESTING ANCHOR THEM AND MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE WEIGHT IN THEM
HB3IofSaLx0_10 0 THIS IS ANN MYRICK AND THAT IS HOW TO DECORATE A BOOK CASE
GtmYFI0ImQ0_1 0 OK NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS KIND OF COOL
GtmYFI0ImQ0_2 0 ALL THE PREFERENCES ARE IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT BUT THIS ONE I THINK THAT THIS ONE IS PRETTY COOL
GtmYFI0ImQ0_3 0 BECAUSE ACTUALLY YOU CAN LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF CPU USAGE BEING MADE
GtmYFI0ImQ0_4 0 AND ACTUALLY YOU'LL BE UNDER GENERAL PREFERENCES AND YOU COME DOWN TO CPU USAGE LIMIT
GtmYFI0ImQ0_5 0 AND RIGHT NOW THE FACTORY DEFAULT IS EIGHTY PERCENT
GtmYFI0ImQ0_6 0 NOW THIS IS THIS IS ENOUGH TO RUN A REASON AT A GOOD RATE AND BUT YOU KNOW ON SOME COMPUTERS YOU MAY HAVE TROUBLE RUNNING YOUR SONGS IF YOU HAVE A LOT GOING ON
GtmYFI0ImQ0_7 0 SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY JACK UP THE COMPUTING POWER IF YOU NEED TO A LOT MORE COMPUTING POWER TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING
GtmYFI0ImQ0_8 0 AND IT LEAVES A PERCENTAGE LEFT OVER TO DEAL WITH OTHER PROGRAMS IF YOU'RE IF REASON IS RE-WIRED WITH OTHER PROGRAMS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
GtmYFI0ImQ0_9 0 SO BASICALLY I THINK THAT IT'S GOOD THOUGH TO LEAVE THE CPU USAGE AT EIGHTY PER CENT
GtmYFI0ImQ0_10 0 I MEAN THAT'S A GOOD AMOUNT
HJTlkLXOjR4_1 0 THE NEXT THING I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO TRY TO ADD SOME TYPE OF CYMBALS AND WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS GO TO MY NEXT AVAILABLE TRACK AND THERE IS CYMBAL RIGHT HERE AND JUST HIT IT ON ONE AND PULL IT OUT AND PRESS PLAY
HJTlkLXOjR4_2 0 TURN IT UP A LITTLE BIT
HJTlkLXOjR4_3 0 WHEN USING THESE YOU CAN ALWAYS ADD MORE CYMBALS BY GOING TO THE NEXT ONE AND PICKING OUT SOME MORE
HJTlkLXOjR4_4 0 MAKE SURE YOU ALWAYS CLICK ON WHAT YOU WANT TO PLAY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWO SEPARATE THINGS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THREE SEPARATE THINGS YOU CAN PLAY AT THE SAME TIME
HJTlkLXOjR4_5 0 YOU CAN PLAY THE SAMPLE YOU CAN PLAY THE ULTRA BEAT OR YOU CAN PLAY THE RANGE WINDOW SO MAKE SURE YOU CLICK THE ONE YOU WANT TO PLAY AND THEN HIT THE SPACE BAR SO NOW I AM GOING TO HIT AND TO HIT ULTRA BEAT I JUST HIT THAT AND TO PLAY THE ARRANGE WINDOW IT'S THE SAME THING AND I CAN HIT IT
gRMzHsP4hns_1 0 HI THIS IS JOSIAH OWEN AND TODAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT RECIPE FOR THOSE WHO ARE ON A DIABETIC DIET
gRMzHsP4hns_2 0 NOW WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT CUTTING OUR BREAD FOR OUR MOZZARELLA PEPPERONI BREAD
gRMzHsP4hns_3 0 TAKE A PIECE OF FRENCH BREAD AND WE ARE GOING TO TURN IT TO THE SIDE AND WE ARE GOING TO CUT IT IN HALF
gRMzHsP4hns_4 0 SO NOW YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A TOP HALF AND A BOTTOM HALF
gRMzHsP4hns_5 0 MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A SHARP BREAD KNIFE FOR THIS CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO SQUISH YOUR BREAD
gRMzHsP4hns_6 0 I MEAN IT WOULD PROBABLY STILL TASTE GOOD BUT YOU NEVER KNOW
gRMzHsP4hns_7 0 SO NOW AFTER THIS YOU WANT TO CUT THESE INTO ONE INCH PIECES
gRMzHsP4hns_8 0 SO WHAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY DO IS PUT THE TOP BACK ON THAT WOULD SAVE YOU A COUPLE OF CUTS
gRMzHsP4hns_9 0 YOU CAN CUT IN A ANGLE
gRMzHsP4hns_10 0 LIKE I SAID THIS IS WHERE A SHARP KNIFE COMES IN TO PLAY
gRMzHsP4hns_11 0 BACK AND FORTH DO OUR LAST LITTLE PIECE AND THERE YOU GO THAT IS HOW YOU CUT YOUR BREAD
gQxr6RuQnF0_1 0 THIS IS RYAN SCOTT FROM THE BOOM TOWN SAINTS ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gQxr6RuQnF0_2 0 IN THIS CLIP I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO THROW THE BACK HAND
gQxr6RuQnF0_3 0 CAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE TEND TO CRANK THEIR WRIST LIKE THIS AND GO LIKE THAT
gQxr6RuQnF0_4 0 THAT'S NOT HOW YOU THROW A PROPER BACK HAND IN DUTCH FRISBEE OR JUST COMPETITIVE FRISBEE IN GENERAL
gQxr6RuQnF0_5 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR ARM BACK AS FAR AS YOU CAN
gQxr6RuQnF0_6 0 THEN WITH YOUR RIGHT FOOT IF YOUR RIGHT-HANDED PUT YOUR RIGHT FOOT DOWN AS A PLANT FOOT
gQxr6RuQnF0_7 0 PUSH OFF YOUR LEFT FOOT AND PULL FORWARD
gQxr6RuQnF0_8 0 WHEN YOU PULL FORWARD YOU TURN YOUR BODY AND AS SOON AS YOUR SHOULDER GETS PAST YOUR OTHER SHOULDER YOUR ELBOW IS GOING TO ACTUALLY KINK
gQxr6RuQnF0_9 0 AS SOON AS YOUR ELBOW KINKS YOU PULL THROUGH WITH THE REST OF YOUR HAND AND THE FRISBEE IS GOING TO COME OFF NICE AND SMOOTH AND HARD
gQxr6RuQnF0_10 0 SO IF YOU GO PUSHING OFF YOUR LEFT FOOT ALL YOUR WEIGHT IS TRANSFERRING OVER TO THE OTHER FOOT
gQxr6RuQnF0_11 0 SO YOU PUSH OFF YOUR LEFT FOOT ONTO YOUR RIGHT AND YOU THROW
gQxr6RuQnF0_12 0 YOU USUALLY WANT TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH YOUR OTHER FOOT TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE MORE POWER
gQxr6RuQnF0_13 0 AND SO WHEN YOU PULL THROUGH YOU PUT ALL YOUR WEIGHT ONTO YOUR LEFT FOOT
gQxr6RuQnF0_14 0 YOU MOVE YOUR HIPS AND YOUR SHOULDERS AT THE SAME TIME
gQxr6RuQnF0_15 0 IT'S THE COMBINATION TIMING THAT PUTS YOU RIGHT THROUGH
gQxr6RuQnF0_16 0 AND YOUR RIGHT LEG PUTS IT RIGHT THROUGH
gQxr6RuQnF0_17 0 YOUR HIPS TURN AND YOU JUST RELEASE
gQxr6RuQnF0_18 0 THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
hGAbXoyb5E4_1 0 GOING TO CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO KICK WITH THE HEEL
hGAbXoyb5E4_2 0 NOW IN TAI CHI AS WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF MIND INTENT INVOLVED IT'S NOT JUST PHYSICAL MOVEMENT
hGAbXoyb5E4_3 0 SO WHERE DO WE PUT OUR MIND IN THE BODY AS WE'RE DOING THESE MOVEMENT
hGAbXoyb5E4_4 0 SO AS I'M DRAWING UP I'M THINKING THAT EVERYTHING IS DRAWING INTO MY CENTER
hGAbXoyb5E4_5 0 DRAWING INTO MY DAN TIEN SO I'M GATHERING IN GATHERING IN GATHERING IN AND THEN JUST LIKE A SUN EXPLODING OUTWARD THAT SUN MOVES OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT
hGAbXoyb5E4_6 0 SO EVERYTHING ENDS AT THE SAME TIME
hGAbXoyb5E4_7 0 HOWEVER WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHAT'S VERY COMMON WHEN WE DO A KICK IS THAT WE LOOSE OUR ROOT
hGAbXoyb5E4_8 0 SO THAT WHEN IF WE KICK WITH OUR ROOT IF WE KICK THE PERSON THAT WE ARE KICKING WILL NOT MOVE
hGAbXoyb5E4_9 0 WE WILL BOUNCE BACKWARDS JUST AS WE WOULD WITH PUSH
hGAbXoyb5E4_10 0 SO WHEN WE ARE DOING THIS MOTION OF EXPANDING OUTWARD WE HAVE TO ALSO BE THINKING WE'RE EXPANDING DOWN WE'RE EXPANDING BACK WE'RE EXPANDING UP IT'S LIKE A BALL OR I LIKE TO SEE IT AS A SUN EXPLODING OUTWARD
hGAbXoyb5E4_11 0 SO I'M GATHERING IN GATHERING IN GATHERING IN AND THEN OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT FROM THE CENTER
hGAbXoyb5E4_12 0 SO IT'S KICKING OUTWARD THIS COMES OUT AND THAT COMES OUT AND THAT GOES DOWN ALL AT THE SAME TIME
hbYDX7_1YVA_1 0 HI I'M JOHN OLSEN FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
hbYDX7_1YVA_2 0 WE HAVE BASICALLY A BI-FACE HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO GO TO A NEXT STEP CALLED THINNING
hbYDX7_1YVA_3 0 I'VE GOT TO DULL THIS A LITTLE BIT ON THE EDGES SO I DON'T CUT MYSELF
hbYDX7_1YVA_4 0 THIS IS A VERY SHARP ROCK
hbYDX7_1YVA_5 0 I NEED TO START PLANNING WHERE I WANT TO TAKE THINNING FLAKES OFF
hbYDX7_1YVA_6 0 IF YOU CAN SEE RIGHT ALONG HERE I HAVE A RIDGE AND THAT'S THE FATTEST PART OF THIS STONE RIGHT NOW
hbYDX7_1YVA_7 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS RIGHT OUT HERE ON THIS EDGE I'M GOING TO CREATE A LITTLE NUBBIN RIGHT THERE AND I'M GOING TO DULL IT UP
hbYDX7_1YVA_8 0 THEN I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER AND I'M GOING TO PUT MY FINGERS RIGHT ON THIS EDGE
hbYDX7_1YVA_9 0 THEN WHEN I COME DOWN AND STRIKE I'M GOING TO STRIKE RIGHT THERE AND AT THE SAME TIME I'M GOING TO BE PULLING WITH MY FINGERS
hbYDX7_1YVA_10 0 SO I'M GOING TO HAVE THIS PRESSURE PULLING
hbYDX7_1YVA_11 0 I'M GOING TO COME IN HERE
hbYDX7_1YVA_12 0 PULL ON IT
hbYDX7_1YVA_13 0 THEN I'M GOING TO STRIKE IT AND I SHOULD HAVE A LONG BLADE COME OFF ON THE BACK SIDE
hbYDX7_1YVA_14 0 WELL IT KIND OF FELL ALL APART BUT IT TOOK OFF THAT RIDGE
hbYDX7_1YVA_15 0 AND THE PROCESS IS GOING AROUND AND DOING ALL THESE LITTLE FINE TUNE HITS THAT WILL THIN THIS THING OUT FOR ME
hbYDX7_1YVA_16 0 I'VE GOT ANOTHER ONE THERE
hbYDX7_1YVA_17 0 LITTLE FLAKE WILL COME OFF THE BACK SIDE
hbYDX7_1YVA_18 0 I'LL JUST ROLL THIS THING ALL THE WAY AROUND AND BEGIN THE PROCESS OF THINNING
hbYDX7_1YVA_19 0 THAT WAS A REALLY NICE HIT
hbYDX7_1YVA_20 0 IT HAD A REALLY NICE SOUND SO IT SHOULD BE A FAIRLY LARGE FLAKE
hbYDX7_1YVA_21 0 AND THAT COULD BE MADE INTO AN ARROW HEAD
hbYDX7_1YVA_22 0 GOT A WIDE SPOT OVER HERE IT'S KIND OF THICK
hbYDX7_1YVA_24 0 THIS IS WHERE I USUALLY GET MYSELF IN TROUBLE BECAUSE I TRY TO MAKE IT TOO THIN BUT WE'RE NO WHERE NEAR THAT POINT RIGHT NOW
GWvJ14cwwKU_1 0 HI I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE HOW TO DO A TOUCH AND GO SQUAT USING A CHAIR
GWvJ14cwwKU_2 0 YOU CAN USE IT AT HOME
GWvJ14cwwKU_3 0 IF YOU'RE IN THE GYM YOU CAN USE A BENCH
GWvJ14cwwKU_4 0 ALL WE'RE GOING TO DO IS PUT YOUR HANDS ALONG YOUR HIPS
GWvJ14cwwKU_5 0 WE'RE GOING TO TOUCH THE END OF THE STEP OR THE END OF THE CHAIR AND THEN SIT BACK UP SO IT'S JUST A QUICK TAP AND GO
GWvJ14cwwKU_6 0 YOU WANT TO DO THESE BACK TO BACK
GWvJ14cwwKU_7 0 TRY TO DO ABOUT 25 FIFTY REPETITIONS
GWvJ14cwwKU_8 0 YOU'RE JUST GOING IN A QUICK MOTION IN AND OUT
GWvJ14cwwKU_9 0 MAKE SURE YOUR KNEES DON'T CAVE IN
GWvJ14cwwKU_10 0 KEEP THEM IN LINE WITH YOUR SECOND AND THIRD TOES AND JUST DROP AND PUSH TOUCH AND GO
GWvJ14cwwKU_11 0 IF THIS IS EASY FOR YOU STEP AWAY FROM THE CHAIR OR THE BENCH
GWvJ14cwwKU_12 0 DROP DOWN A LITTLE BIT LOWER
GWvJ14cwwKU_13 0 HANDS ARE GOING TO COME UP HERE
GWvJ14cwwKU_14 0 ELBOWS TO THE KNEES PUSH UP AND DOWN JUST TOUCH AND GO
GWvJ14cwwKU_15 0 WE DON'T WANT ANY WEIGHT ON THIS BECAUSE WE WANT THIS TO BE A FAST TWITCH MUSCLE GROUP WORK AS OPPOSED TO SLOW TWITCH
GWvJ14cwwKU_16 0 JUST DRIVE IT UP AND DOWN
GWvJ14cwwKU_17 0 GET THAT HEART RATE UP
GWvJ14cwwKU_18 0 GET THE LEGS FIRING
GWvJ14cwwKU_19 0 RELAX THE SHOULDERS DOWN THE SPINE CHEST OPEN
GWvJ14cwwKU_20 0 AGAIN WE WANT TO DO REPS TO FAILURE ON THIS ONE BECAUSE EIGHT TWELVE REPS ISN'T GOING TO BE ENOUGH PROBABLY FOR YOU SO JUST TRY TO BUILD IT UP ONE REP AT A TIME AND DO TWO THREE SETS AND THAT'S HOW WE DO OUR TOUCH AND GO SQUATS
gZXd5wK4rW4_1 0 OKAY SO WE'VE LANDED ON A HARD PAN HERE
gZXd5wK4rW4_2 0 HARD PAN GETS ITS NAME BECAUSE THIS IS VERY HARD SOIL
gZXd5wK4rW4_3 0 THERE'S NO GRASS ON IT THERE'S NO MOISTURE IT'S PRETTY HARD BAKED BY THE SUN
gZXd5wK4rW4_4 0 SO THE PROBLEM WITH HITTING OFF OF THIS IS YOU CAN'T GET THE CLUB UNDERNEATH THE BALL LIKE YOU CAN IN GRASS OR SAND OR EVEN LOOSE IMPEDIMENTS
gZXd5wK4rW4_5 0 SO THIS IS A TOUGH LIE BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE TO TRY TO GET UNDERNEATH THE BALL A LITTLE BIT TO GET IT UP
gZXd5wK4rW4_6 0 SO WHAT YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO DO HERE IS TO PICK THE BALL CLEANLY OFF THIS SURFACE BECAUSE IT IS ALMOST LIKE HITTING OFF OF CONCRETE
gZXd5wK4rW4_7 0 SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO WITH THE HARD PAN AND IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHERE YOU PLAY AT EVEN THE FINEST COURSES MIGHT HAVE SPOTS OF THIS BECAUSE SOMETIMES ITS HARD TO GET GRASS TO GROW DUE TO TREES OR WHAT HAVE YOU AND YOU GET THOSE HARD PANS
gZXd5wK4rW4_8 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO LINE UP LIKE YOU WOULD HIT A NORMAL SHOT BUT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT BEING SUPER RELAXED BECAUSE IF YOU TRY MUSCLE THIS BALL AT ALL WHAT HAPPENS IS OFF HARD PAN THE CLUB HITS THE HARD PAN AND THEN SKIPS INTO THE BACK OF THE BALL PRODUCING A SKULL SHOT
gZXd5wK4rW4_9 0 AND THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN LOSE A LOT OF STROKES IS WHEN YOU HIT A SKULL WHEN YOU SKULL A BALL YOU CAN GO INTO WATER SAND TREES WHO KNOWS WHERE
gZXd5wK4rW4_10 0 SO WHEN YOU'RE ON HARD PAN DON'T GET DISCOURAGED
gZXd5wK4rW4_11 0 I WANT YOU JUST TO LINE UP AND BE TOTALLY RELAXED AND JUST TAKE A NICE DEEP BREATH
gZXd5wK4rW4_12 0 BREATHE NICE AND EASY AND TAKE A NICE EASY SWING AND REMEMBER YOU JUST WANT TO PICK THE BALL CLEANLY OFF OF THIS WITH A MINIMAL DIVOT
gZXd5wK4rW4_13 0 THEN HARD PAN ISN'T SO HARD
gJpKOK4X3MI_1 0 ALRIGHT SINCE WE'RE OUTDOORS WHAT I GOT IS MY ROLLER HOCKEY BALL
gJpKOK4X3MI_2 0 IF I WERE INDOOR I WOULD HAVE A ROLLER HOCKEY PUCK
gJpKOK4X3MI_3 0 BUT BASICALLY THE BALL MOVES REALLY WELL OUT HERE
gJpKOK4X3MI_4 0 AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S CRACKS OUT ON THIS SURFACE BUT IT JUST HELPS WITH ALL THE CRACKS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND IT'S EASY TO CONTROL AS YOU CAN SEE
gJpKOK4X3MI_5 0 I MEAN I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM MOVING BACK AND FORTH
gJpKOK4X3MI_6 0 I MEAN USING IT OUT HERE IS A GREAT IDEA
gJpKOK4X3MI_7 0 MOST OUTDOOR ROLLER HOCKEY PLAYERS WOULD USE A BALL JUST LIKE THIS
gJpKOK4X3MI_8 0 IT'S A NICE HARD PLASTIC
gJpKOK4X3MI_9 0 IF YOU'RE SHOOTING AT A GOAL YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO WEAR PROPER EQUIPMENT OR EVEN CHIN GUARDS FOR THE PLAYERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
gJpKOK4X3MI_10 0 REGULAR EQUIPMENT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA USING THIS
gJpKOK4X3MI_11 0 OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT AS WELL USE A TENNIS BALL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
gJpKOK4X3MI_12 0 BUT THIS IS A REGULAR PUCK THAT YOU'D WANT TO USE OUTDOORS
H_h0ReudZLw_1 0 OKAY NEXT I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE A SERIES OF EXERCISES
H_h0ReudZLw_2 0 BUT FIRST IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT EXERCISES AND POSES IN THE YOGA AND PILATE'S FAMILIES ARE EXCELLENT FOR KNEE PROBLEMS
H_h0ReudZLw_3 0 THESE EXERCISES WHEN PERFORMED ON A CONSISTENT BASIS DEFINITELY GETS YOUR BODY FEELING STRONGER AND IT DEFINITELY DOESN'T PUT STRESS ON THE KNEE
H_h0ReudZLw_4 0 SO IF YOU DO HAVE A LOCAL COMMUNITY CENTER OR EVEN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR A YOGA STUDIO NEAR YOU AND HAVE KNEE PROBLEMS YOU MAY WANT TO GET A MEMBERSHIP THERE
H_h0ReudZLw_5 0 YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE SOME CLASSES THERE OR YOU CAN JUST POP IN YOGA AND PILATE'S VIDEOS AT HOME IF THAT'S WHAT YOU PREFER
H_h0ReudZLw_6 0 BUT THOSE EXERCISES ARE EXCELLENT FOR KNEE PROBLEMS AND I DEFINITELY ADVISE YOU TO FOLLOW A PROGRAM ON A CONSISTENT BASIS TO REALLY SUPPORT YOU IN GETTING THE KNEE FEELING STRONGER AND SUPPORTED
H_h0ReudZLw_7 0 SO WHEN WE SUPPORT THE MUSCLES THAT ARE AROUND THE KNEE THEN WE DEFINITELY TAKE A LOT OF STRESS OFF OF THE KNEE
H_h0ReudZLw_8 0 SO THESE EXERCISES THAT I AM GOING TO DEMONSTRATE WILL DEFINITELY STRENGTHEN YOUR WHOLE BODY
H_h0ReudZLw_9 0 PERFORM THEM ON A CONSISTENT BASIS AND YOU WILL SEE RESULTS
Gjyw0zUv-gs_1 0 WE HAVE TO FEED HIM EVERY THREE TO FOUR HOURS AND FEED IT THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT
Gjyw0zUv-gs_2 0 THEY JUST NEED TO EAT
Gjyw0zUv-gs_3 0 WHEN THEY ARE WITH THEIR MOTHERS THEY JUST TURN OVER AND NURSE WHENEVER THEY ARE HUNGRY SO THIS IS A LOT OF WORK TO TAKE CARE OF A PUPPY AND IT TAKES A BUNCH OF TIME BUT IN A WEEK OR SO SHE IS GOING TO START ACTUALLY IN ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF SHE WILL START TO EAT SOME PUPPY FOOD AND THAT IS WHEN WE CAN INTRODUCE SOME PUPPY FOOD WITH SOME MILK IN IT AND SEE IF SHE WILL START EATING
Gjyw0zUv-gs_4 0 SOME THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO WATCH OUT FOR WHEN YOU ARE CARING FOR A PUPPY LIKE THIS IS ONE IF IT STARTS GETTING LETHARGIC
Gjyw0zUv-gs_5 0 IF THEY ARE GETTING TIRED AND THEY DON'T WANT TO MOVE AROUND THAT MAY BE A SIGN THAT THEY ARE STARTING TO GET SICK
Gjyw0zUv-gs_6 0 SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE WANT TO WATCH FOR IS DIARRHEA
Gjyw0zUv-gs_7 0 IF YOU ARE STARTING TO NOTICE THAT THEY ARE JUST GETTING VERY WATERY DIARRHEA RATHER THAN FORMING STOOLS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE CARED FOR
Gjyw0zUv-gs_8 0 THEY MAY HAVE INTERNAL PARASITES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED OR SOME OTHER FORM OF INFECTION
Gjyw0zUv-gs_9 0 WE ALSO WANT TO WATCH FOR ANY SIGNS THAT SHE IS GETTING DISCHARGE FROM HER NOSE OR HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING
Gjyw0zUv-gs_10 0 WITH THESE PUPPIES IT IS VERY EASY FOR THEM TO GET PNEUMONIA AND RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS IF THE MILK GOES INTO THEIR LUNGS OR INTO THEIR NOSE AND WE ARE TRYING TO BE A MOM TO THIS PUPPY BUT REALLY IT IS NOTHING LIKE THE REAL THING
Gjyw0zUv-gs_11 0 WE ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE PUPPIES STAY WITH THEIR MOTHERS AT ANY COST YOU NEVER WANT TO PULL THEM FROM THEIR MOTHER IF THERE IS A MOTHER AVAILABLE
Gjyw0zUv-gs_12 0 MOM'S CARE IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN ANY CARE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE EVEN IF WE DO THE ABSOLUTE BEST FOR THEM
GWDDHTiRehI_1 0 OKAY THE NEXT TIP I WANT TO STRESS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING PLENTY OF JUMP ROPES IN THE GYM UM AND NOT ALL JUST ONE SIZE NOT ALL JUST ONE LENGTH NOT ALL ONE DESIGN YOU WANT TO HAVE AN ASSORTMENT OF JUMP ROPES SO THAT YOU GET A GOOD VARIETY FOR THE VARIETY OF BOXER THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
GWDDHTiRehI_2 0 YOU'RE GOING TO WANT SOME JUMP ROPES THAT ARE SHORT UM YOU'RE GOING TO WANT SOME JUMP ROPES THAT ARE LIGHT IN WEIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT SOME JUMP ROPES THAT ARE QUITE LONG AND ALSO JUMP ROPES THAT ARE THICKER AND HEAVIER
GWDDHTiRehI_3 0 UM ONE OF THE JUMP ROPES WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT IS THE PLASTIC SPEED ROPE
GWDDHTiRehI_4 0 THIS IS A LITTLE BIT FASTER THAN YOUR AVERAGE JUMP ROPE UM IT'S ALSO ADJUSTABLE AS IN ONCE YOU UH DECIDE YOU NEED A LITTLE BIT SHORTER YOU CAN PASS IT THROUGH PUT ON ANOTHER NUT AND ACTUALLY SHORTEN IT
GWDDHTiRehI_5 0 OF COURSE ONCE IT'S SHORT IT'S SHORT
GWDDHTiRehI_6 0 THE OTHER JUMP ROPES WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT IS A LEATHER MORE HEAVIER JUMP ROPE
GWDDHTiRehI_7 0 BUT THIS ALSO HAS WEIGHTED HANDLE SO NOT ONLY IS THE LEATHER A LITTLE BIT HEAVIER BUT ALSO THE WEIGHTED HANDLES MAYBE EVEN A BETTER WORK OUT
GWDDHTiRehI_8 0 AND ONE OF THE THIRD JUMP ROPES WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT IS A SIMPLE COTTON JUMP ROPE UM A LITTLE BIT SLOWER BUT A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO USE THAN THE QUICKER FASTER ONES AND THE HEAVIER ONES
GpYSBDInzAc_1 0 ANOTHER ACTIVITY THAT KIDS HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH IS FEEDING BIRDS IN THE WINTER
GpYSBDInzAc_2 0 IT'S KIND OF EXCITING BECAUSE YOU GET TO SEE A LOT OF REALLY COLORFUL BIRDS THEY STAND OUT IN THE SNOW AND YOU CAN DO GAMES WITH THE KIDS WHERE YOU KNOW WHO CAN SEE THE FIRST CARDINAL OR THE FIRST BLUE JAY THAT COMES AFTER YOU PUT THE FOOD IN THE BIRD FEEDERS
GpYSBDInzAc_3 0 SO IT HELPS THEM TO LEARN ABOUT NATURE AND YOU CAN MAKE GAMES OUT IT AND IT GETS YOU OUTSIDE
GpYSBDInzAc_4 0 I KNOW FOR MY KIDS THEY DEFINITELY APPRECIATE WATCHING THE BIRDS ENJOY THE FOOD THAT WE TAKE OUT THERE
GpYSBDInzAc_5 0 SO JUST YOU KNOW ANOTHER ACTIVITY TO GET YOU OUTSIDE
GpYSBDInzAc_6 0 OKAY BAILEY RIGHT OVER THERE
GpYSBDInzAc_7 0 IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOME FEEDERS THAT ARE LOW ENOUGH SO THE KIDS CAN ACTUALLY PUT THE BIRD SEEDS IN THEMSELVES
GpYSBDInzAc_8 0 I HAVE A FEW THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER UP
GpYSBDInzAc_9 0 BUT I THINK THE ACT OF THEM BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY POUR IT IN THEIR SELVES HAS A LITTLE BIT OF MEANING FOR THEM AND AGAIN HELPING THEM TO PARTICIPATE AND FEEL LIKE THEIR PART OF THE ACTIVITY
GpYSBDInzAc_10 0 ALRIGHT COME HERE WILL YOU HOLD THAT FOR ME
GpYSBDInzAc_11 0 YES THERE YOU GO
HB7sHwAxCBg_1 0 HELLO WELCOME TO EXPERT VILLAGE
HB7sHwAxCBg_2 0 MY NAME IS WAYNE PETERSEN DIRECTOR OF THE MASSACHUSETTS AUDUBON SOCIETY IMPORTANT BIRD AREAS PROGRAM AND WE'RE HERE THIS AFTERNOON AT THE DANIEL WEBSTER WILDLIFE SANCTUARY IN MARSHVILLE MASSACHUSETTS
HB7sHwAxCBg_3 0 NEXT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BACKYARD BIRDING A PLACE WHERE EVERYBODY HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET INVOLVED AND WHERE MANY PEOPLE'S INTEREST IN BIRDING FIRST BEGINS
HB7sHwAxCBg_4 0 IN THINKING ABOUT BACKYARD BIRDING THERE ARE A VARIETY OF THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WILL MAXIMIZE THE EXPERIENCE
HB7sHwAxCBg_5 0 ONE OF THESE IS OBVIOUSLY TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF BIRDS WHICH MEANS BY LOCATING YOUR FEEDERS IN PLACES WHERE THEY ARE RELATIVELY CLOSE TO SHRUBS THAT BIRDS CAN QUICKLY ESCAPE INTO OR TREES THAT THEY CAN FLY UP INTO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN MIND BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE SAFETY OF THE BACKYARD BIRDS ARE AS IMPORTANT
HB7sHwAxCBg_6 0 LIKEWISE IF YOU HAVE A CAT YOU SHOULD KEEP THE CAT INDOORS
HB7sHwAxCBg_7 0 UNFORTUNATELY LOTS OF FOLKS HAVE THE FEELING THAT IF THEY PUT A CAT OUT THE FRONT DOOR AND THEIR BIRD FEEDERS ARE IN THE BACKYARD THERE WON'T BE A CONFLICT WELL UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT THE CASE
HB7sHwAxCBg_8 0 LIKEWISE HAVING YOUR FEEDER SITUATED IN PLACES WHERE YOU CAN SEE THEM IS IMPORTANT SO YOU WANT TO PUT THEM A PLACE WHERE YOU HAVE READY VIEW ABILITY FROM A WINDOW OR WHATEVER
HB7sHwAxCBg_9 0 LIKEWISE IN ORDER TO HAVE THE FEEDERS BE RELATIVELY FREE FROM WHAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD DESCRIBE AS PESKY COMPETITORS LIKE SQUIRRELS IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE BAFFLES OF THIS SORT ON THE POLE AND AS YOU CAN SEE AND AS WE'LL MENTION SHORTLY THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF BIRD FEEDERS AND SO ON THAT CAN BE PUT UP FOR BIRDS
HB7sHwAxCBg_10 0 BIRDS WILL FIND THEM AND IN ADDITION TO HANGING FEEDERS LIKE THIS THAT ARE FILLED WITH SEEDS WITH THE APPROPRIATE BAFFLE TO KEEP PESKY SQUIRRELS AND THINGS AWAY
HB7sHwAxCBg_11 0 IT'S ALSO TO PUT BIRD SEED RIGHT ON THE GROUND LOTS OF BIRDS WILL HAPPILY FEED ON THE GROUND AND ACTUALLY DON'T LIKE TO NECESSARILY FEED OFF THE GROUND
HB7sHwAxCBg_12 0 SO AGAIN YOU'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE A MIX OF SORT OF OVERALL LANDSCAPE LEVEL CONSIDERATIONS THAT WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE LOCATION OF YOUR VIEWING STATION OR WINDOWS AS WELL AS PROVIDE CONDITIONS THAT ARE HOPEFULLY GOING TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE BIRDS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT TO YOUR YARD
hFlr4F-qZEA_1 0 SHERYL MCGLOCHLIN HI THIS IS SHERYL WITH EXPERTVILLAGE.COM
hFlr4F-qZEA_2 0 AND TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUILDING A CAMPFIRE IN YOUR OWN BACKYARD IN THE SNOW
hFlr4F-qZEA_3 0 NOW THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS WE HAVE ALREADY PUT IN THIS FIRE
hFlr4F-qZEA_4 0 WE HAD KINDLING LIKE NEWSPAPER AND SHAVINGS PIECES OF WOOD AND WE ALSO HAVE OUR LOGS IN HERE BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU SHOULD NOT PUT IN A FIRE
hFlr4F-qZEA_5 0 PLASTICS FOR INSTANCE SHOULD NOT EVER GO IN A FIRE
hFlr4F-qZEA_6 0 ALSO AEROSOL CANS OR THINGS THAT ARE NOT GOING TO BURN NAILS AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINGS LIKE THAT
hFlr4F-qZEA_7 0 OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT ARE SHOULD NOT GO WHAT ELSE
hFlr4F-qZEA_9 0 SHERYL MCGLOCHLIN CANS
hFlr4F-qZEA_11 0 ANY KIND OF METAL SHOULD NOT GO IN THE CANS OR SHOULD NOT IN THE FIRE
hFlr4F-qZEA_12 0 AND SMOKE INHALATION CAN ALSO GET TO YOU
hFlr4F-qZEA_13 0 THAT'S A FACTOR RIGHT NOW
hFlr4F-qZEA_14 0 I WAS GETTING TOO CLOSE TO THIS FIRE
hFlr4F-qZEA_15 0 A HEAD SHOULD NOT GO IN THE FIRE AND SO I'M GOING TO MOVE
GcGzewrbLF4_1 0 IN THIS SECTION I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT GAME NUMBER SIX
GcGzewrbLF4_2 0 A LITTLE QUICK REMINDER SOME OF THESE GAMES MAY SEEM TEDIOUS OR SEEM LIKE IT'S INSTRUCTIONAL BUT REALLY IT'S A LOT OF FUN IF YOU DO
GcGzewrbLF4_3 0 YOU KNOW JUST HOW YOU BRING IT ACROSS TO THEM
GcGzewrbLF4_4 0 SO THIS ONE HAVE THEM RELAX ON THEIR BACK
GcGzewrbLF4_5 0 YOU KNOW ARMS WIDE OPEN
GcGzewrbLF4_6 0 TELL THEM TO JUST LOOK UP TO THE SKY CLOSE THEIR EYES AS IF THEY ARE GOING TO SLEEP ON A PILLOW
GcGzewrbLF4_7 0 SEE HOW LONG THEY CAN DO THAT FOR
GcGzewrbLF4_8 0 WHAT I TECHNICALLY DO SOMETIMES IS KIND OF PUT MY HAND ON THEIR FOREHEAD JUST SO THAT WAY THEY FEEL A LITTLE BIT OF SUPPORT THERE AND MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE BIT UNDERNEATH THEIR BACK
GcGzewrbLF4_9 0 THEN AS THEY RELAX TELL THEM TO RELAX THEIR HEART RATE JUST KIND OF RELAX ON THEIR BACK
GcGzewrbLF4_10 0 AS THEY DO THAT YOU CAN SLOWLY KIND OF LET GO OF YOUR HAND ON THEIR BACK
GcGzewrbLF4_11 0 BUT DON'T TELL THEM RIGHT AWAY
GcGzewrbLF4_12 0 JUST TELL THEM MAYBE THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME ONCE THEY'VE DOING IT FOR AWHILE
GcGzewrbLF4_13 0 IT'S A REALLY FUN GAME KIDS USUALLY HAVE FUN IF YOU KIND OF JUST EASE THEM INTO IT AND YOU TELL THEM TO RELAX THEIR BREATHING IMAGE IF THEY WERE AT HOME GOING TO SLEEP ON THEIR PILLOW AND JUST HAVE THEIR CHINS LIFTED UP LOOKING UP TO THE SUN WITH THEIR EYES CLOSED
GcGzewrbLF4_14 0 JUST TELL THEM TO JUST REALLY GO TO SLEEP AND SEE HOW LONG THEY CAN DO THAT FOR THAT'S USUALLY REALLY FUN
GcGzewrbLF4_15 0 THAT'S RELAXING ON YOUR BACK
hCsU8sf9wYk_1 0 VICTORIA GUTAVAS IT'S BEEN GREAT SHARING THE MAKING OF THIS FABULOUS MEAL WITH YOU
hCsU8sf9wYk_2 0 MY GRANDMOTHER [PH] FORTINI WOULD BE REALLY REALLY PROUD OF ME

hCsU8sf9wYk_6 0 THIS IS VICTORIA GUTAVAS WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
hGbB-iAjULM_1 0 WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WE'VE BEEN ADDING ANOTHER ROW TO OUR CRINKLED UP DOUBLE CROCHETED SCRUNCHIE THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON
hGbB-iAjULM_2 0 YOU SEE WE'VE JUST BEEN GOING AROUND ADDING ANOTHER ROW ADDING JUST A COLUMN ON TOP OF EACH COLUMN THAT THERE IS
hGbB-iAjULM_3 0 JUST A REMINDER TO RECAP THE WAY WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT IS YOU JUST GRAB SOME YARN AND GO DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH A CHAIN PULL THE YARN THROUGH
hGbB-iAjULM_4 0 YOU'VE GOT THE THREE LOOPS PULL IT THROUGH THE FIRST TWO AND PULL IT THROUGH THE SECOND TWO
hGbB-iAjULM_5 0 WE'VE GOT A NEW COLUMN
hGbB-iAjULM_6 0 REMEMBER AGAIN THE KEY TO MAKING THIS COME OUT RIGHT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T SKIP ANY OF THESE CHAINS ON TOP
hGbB-iAjULM_7 0 YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET EVERY SINGLE ONE
hGbB-iAjULM_8 0 SO AGAIN IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE YOU CAN JUST STRAIGHTEN IT OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN SEE ALL YOUR CHAINS AND THEN CRINKLE IT UP LATER
hGbB-iAjULM_9 0 YOU SEE WE'VE GOT A NICE WIDE THICK AND FULL LOOKING CRINKLED UP SCRUNCHIE
hGbB-iAjULM_10 0 SO TO FINISH IT OFF WE'RE GOING TO GO UNDERNEATH HERE AND KEEP DOING MY DOUBLE
hGbB-iAjULM_11 0 I'M JUST MAKING SURE I GRAB EVERY SINGLE CHAIN TO ADD ANOTHER ROW TO IT
hGbB-iAjULM_12 0 AGAIN IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS YOU CAN JUST PULL YOUR YARN BACK OUT
hGbB-iAjULM_13 0 JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOUR NEEDLE IS ALWAYS AT LEAST IN ONE LOOP
hGbB-iAjULM_14 0 THERE WE GO
hGbB-iAjULM_15 0 NEVER HAVE ANY WORRIES ABOUT ACCIDENTALLY CUTTING OR SPLITTING YOUR YARNS LIKE THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS BACKTRACK
hGbB-iAjULM_16 0 IT'S SO EASY TO BACKTRACK IN A CROCHET
hGbB-iAjULM_17 0 JUST KEEP WORKING ALL THE WAY AROUND
hGbB-iAjULM_18 0 THEN YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE OF COURSE YOU GET THE VERY LAST ONE
hGbB-iAjULM_19 0 YOU WANT TO GET IT ALL THE WAY CLOSED
hGbB-iAjULM_20 0 THEN WE ARE GOING TO COUNT UP THREE CHAINS TO CLOSE IT UP THE WAY WE NORMALLY DO
hGbB-iAjULM_21 0 THERE IS ONE CHAIN TWO CHAINS THREE CHAINS PUT YOUR NEEDLE UNDER THERE PULL YOUR YARN THROUGH
hGbB-iAjULM_22 0 THERE WE GO
hGbB-iAjULM_23 0 WE HAVE A NICE FULL AND WIDE VERY NOTICEABLY VERY MUCH LOOKS LIKE A STANDARD SCRUNCHIE THAT YOU WOULD BUY IN ANY KIND OF STORE WHERE ANY KIND OF HAIR SUPPLIES ARE SOLD
hGbB-iAjULM_24 0 THERE WE GO
hGbB-iAjULM_25 0 VERY INDIVIDUAL AND UNIQUE TO YOU
hGbB-iAjULM_26 0 WHATEVER COLORS YOU WANT
hGbB-iAjULM_27 0 YOU CAN DO MULTIPLE COLORS
hGbB-iAjULM_28 0 IT'S SO EASY TO MAKE A NICE LITTLE SCRUNCHIE FOR YOURSELF TO PUT IN YOUR HAIR
GIdUQK1Br54_1 0 OKAY WE'RE BACK AGAIN AT ABUNDANCE
GIdUQK1Br54_2 0 THIS IS SYNDRA WITH ABUNDANCE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EVENING WEAR FOR PLUS SIZES
GIdUQK1Br54_3 0 THE APPLE SHAPE IS REALLY A LOT OF FUN TO WORK WITH BECAUSE A LOT OF WOMEN THINK OH MY GOSH I HAVE TO HAVE THREE PIECES TO COVER YOU KNOW MY MIDDLE AND I CAN'T HAVE A GOWN
GIdUQK1Br54_4 0 WELL WE'RE HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE
GIdUQK1Br54_5 0 THERE ARE SOME GORGEOUS BALL GOWNS OUT THERE THAT ARE DESIGNED WITH ROUCHING HERE THAT HIDES A MULTITUDE OF SINS
GIdUQK1Br54_6 0 ANA IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE
GIdUQK1Br54_7 0 AS YOU REMEMBER FROM LAST TIME ANA IS AN APPLE SHAPE
GIdUQK1Br54_8 0 AND SHE HAS SHE CARRIES HER WEIGHT HERE IN THE CENTER
GIdUQK1Br54_9 0 THIS GOWN IS PERFECT FOR HER
GIdUQK1Br54_10 0 IT'S A BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE OF WHAT CAN BE DONE AND HOW TO FLATTER THE FIGURE
GIdUQK1Br54_11 0 YOU'LL SEE OBVIOUSLY THE ROUCHING BUT THE BEADING IS KEY HERE
GIdUQK1Br54_12 0 THE BEAD WORK IS DONE IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT CAMOUFLAGES AND SORT OF PULLS INTO A CENTER LINE AND REALLY MINIMIZES THE WIDTH OF THE TUMMY AREA
GIdUQK1Br54_13 0 IN ADDITION THIS PARTICULAR DRESS HAS A LOT OF INTEREST GOING ON UP AT THE SHOULDERS
GIdUQK1Br54_14 0 WELL NOW ANA HAS BROAD SHOULDERS
GIdUQK1Br54_15 0 SO YOU MIGHT THINK THAT AN OFF THE SHOULDER GOWN WOULD NOT BE THE MOST FLATTERING
GIdUQK1Br54_16 0 HOWEVER LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS HERE WHEN YOU HAVE THE STRAP THE DECORATIVE STRAP ADDED
GIdUQK1Br54_17 0 IT ACTUALLY CUTS THE HORIZONTAL WIDTH OF THE SHOULDER AS WELL
GIdUQK1Br54_18 0 AS BRINGING THE INTEREST UP AND CONTINUING TO REALLY GIVE THAT LONGER LINE
GAEUXO3Pe1w_1 0 LEARNING HOW TO SING IF YOU DON'T HAVE A NATURAL ABILITY AND YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO SING YOU CAN
GAEUXO3Pe1w_2 0 YOU CAN GET VOCAL LESSONS IF YOU WANT TO LEARN ON YOUR OWN
GAEUXO3Pe1w_3 0 I WOULD JUST TRY TO EMULATE THE SINGERS THAT YOU REALLY LIKE AND TRY TO SING LIKE THEM
GAEUXO3Pe1w_4 0 AND TRY TO DEFINITELY IF YOU CAN STAY ON KEY THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
GAEUXO3Pe1w_5 0 IF YOU CAN STAY ON KEY THEN I WOULD JUST EXERCISE BY SINGING ALONG TO YOUR FAVORITE VOCALISTS AND THEN EXPAND OFF OF THAT
GAEUXO3Pe1w_6 0 WORK ON YOUR TONE WORK ON THE WAY YOU PRONOUNCE
GAEUXO3Pe1w_7 0 BUT LEARNING HOW TO SING IS A LOT OF IT IS NATURAL ABILITY
GAEUXO3Pe1w_8 0 AND STAYING ON KEY WOULDN'T KNOWING IF YOU'RE HIGHER THEN THE NOTE OR LOWER THEN THE NOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT
GAEUXO3Pe1w_9 0 IF YOU CAN SING ALONG AND YOU HEAR YOURSELF AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE LOWER THEN THE NOTE AND YOU CAN SING UP TO THE RIGHT NOTE
GAEUXO3Pe1w_10 0 THEN THAT'S GOOD
GAEUXO3Pe1w_11 0 ANOTHER THING YOU CAN DO IS RECORD YOURSELF YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO HAVE RECORDING STUDIO YOU COULD HAVE LIKE A LITTLE VOICE RECORDER AND YOU CAN SING ALONG AND YOU CAN LISTEN TO YOURSELF
GAEUXO3Pe1w_12 0 SO THAT WAY YOU GET A BETTER OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE OF YOUR SINGING ABILITY
GAEUXO3Pe1w_13 0 SO BASICALLY YOU LISTEN TO YOUR FAVORITE SINGERS YOU RECORD YOURSELF YOU LISTEN TO YOURSELF FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE
GAEUXO3Pe1w_14 0 THOSE ARE PRETTY MUCH BASIC THINGS THAT YOU CAN HELP YOURSELF LEARN HOW TO SING
g5i7jfPAPXQ_1 0 EMIL LAMPRECHT ONCE YOU HAVE A CONFIDENT FOUR-BALL SHOWER PATTERN DOWN YOU CAN LEARN TRICKS WITHIN IT IN VARIOUS VARIATIONS
g5i7jfPAPXQ_2 0 THIS IS ONE OF THEM
g5i7jfPAPXQ_3 0 I CALL IT A SHOWER STACKBUT YOU CAN ALSO CALL IT A MULTIPLEX ET CETERA
g5i7jfPAPXQ_4 0 NOW THE THINGS TO PRACTICE FOR THIS ARE FIRST OF ALL BEING ABLE TO THROW YOUR STACK MULTIPLEX HIGH INTO THE OTHER HAND
g5i7jfPAPXQ_5 0 ONCE YOU CAN DO THAT START TO VAMP THE BALLS ONE AT A TIME BACK TO THE HAND THEY WERE THROWN FROM
g5i7jfPAPXQ_6 0 YOU'LL WANT TO PRACTICE THIS ON BOTH SIDES OF COURSE AS THE TRICK WILL LOOK BETTER IF YOU CAN DO IT BOTH DIRECTIONS
g5i7jfPAPXQ_7 0 AND THEN ADD ALL FOUR BALLS START YOUR SHOWER PATTERN STACK A MULTIPLEX AND GIVE IT A TOSS
g5i7jfPAPXQ_8 0 AFTER YOU'VE TOSSED YOUR MULTIPLEX JUST PRACTICE STOPPING UNTIL YOU CAN GET THE MULTIPLEX SPLIT WELL ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN VAMP THEM OVER ONE AT A TIME AND CONTINUE THE SHOWER PATTERN
GvggbtnnSaI_1 0 WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO NOW IS WE HAVE WEDGED OUR CLAY SO WE HAVE WEDGED OUR LARGE LUMP OF CLAY TO MAKE THIS BIG BOWL THAT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AND THE THINGS YOU ARE GOING TO WANT EQUIPMENT WISE YOU'RE GOING TO WANT A BAT
GvggbtnnSaI_2 0 NOW I LIKE TO USE A BAT THAT IS GOING TO FIT ON MY WHEEL AND GIVE ME SOME EDGE AROUND IT
GvggbtnnSaI_3 0 NOW THIS MEANS THAT I CAN KIND OF STICK CLAY AROUND THERE TO HOLD IT DOWN WHILE I AM CENTERING AND WORKING ON THIS LARGE PIECE
GvggbtnnSaI_4 0 THE BAT IS GOING TO HAVE A TENDENCY TO WANT TO PULL UP ON YOU AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT WHEN YOU ARE WORKING ON SOMETHING BIG LIKE THIS
GvggbtnnSaI_5 0 THE TOOLS THAT I USE FOR THROWING LARGE BOWLS THESE ARE MY MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS AND THESE ARE RIBS WOODEN RIBS AND I USE THOSE TO SHAPE THE BOWL AND TO SQUEEZE THE CLAY AND I'LL SHOW YOU MORE ON THAT LATER
GvggbtnnSaI_6 0 THESE ARE TRIMMING TOOLS WE WILL USE THESE ONCE THE BOWL HAS DRIED OUT AND WE'LL FLIP IT OVER AND USE THESE TO TRIM THE FOOT ON THE BASE OF IT
GvggbtnnSaI_7 0 THIS IS A PIN TOOL
GvggbtnnSaI_8 0 PERHAPS WE WILL SEE MORE ON THIS LATER BUT IT IS JUST A GENERAL TOOL THAT IS USED FOR CARVING BITS OFF THE BOWLS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
GvggbtnnSaI_9 0 THIS IS A WIRE TOOL AND WE ARE GOING TO USE THAT TO DISCONNECT THE BOWL AT THE END OF THE PROJECT
GvggbtnnSaI_10 0 WE NEED THINGS LIKE SPONGES
GvggbtnnSaI_11 0 WE NEED WATER
GvggbtnnSaI_12 0 I LIKE TO USE A LITTLE WARM WATER IT IS NICE ON THE HANDS AND THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO NEED AND NOW WE ARE READY TO MOVE THE CLAY ON TO THE WHEEL HEAD AND GET IT CENTERED UP
hhimjseyKbA_1 0 HERE WE HAVE WHAT HAS BEEN TITLED A LANTERN SLEEVE AND AGAIN LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IS VERY LITERAL
hhimjseyKbA_2 0 THE DEFINITION SUITS THE TYPE OF SLEEVE BECAUSE WE HAVE A FITTED SLEEVE AT THE TOP AND THEN THINK OF A LITTLE PAUL REVERE CARRYING HIS LANTERN LANTERN SHAPE AT THE BOTTOM AND WHAT WE HAVE HERE IN ACTUAL REALITY WOULD BE TWO SEPARATE PIECES FOR YOUR SLEEVE
hhimjseyKbA_3 0 THERE'S GOING TO BE FITTED SLEEVE WHICH GOES BACK TO THE THREE-QUARTER VERSION THAT I'VE SHOWED YOU
hhimjseyKbA_4 0 IT'S GOING TO BE THREE-QUARTER LENGTH DOWN TO MID-FOREARM AND SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT TO THE MID-FOREARM
hhimjseyKbA_5 0 AND THEN THERE'S A SEAM LINE BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOUR SECOND PIECE OF FABRIC THAT CREATES AND MAKES IT ACTUALLY THE LANTERN PART OF IT AND REMEMBER I DIDN'T SHOW YOU RIGHT THERE BUT ADD IN THE EASE OF MOVEMENT RIGHT THERE BECAUSE THAT ALSO HELPS TO CREATE THE ACTUAL LANTERN SHAPE
hhimjseyKbA_6 0 AND THEN IT'S THE UPSIDE DOWN VERSION OF WHAT YOU HAVE AT THE TOP
hhimjseyKbA_7 0 JUST FLIP IT AND THEN COME DOWN AT THE WRIST LINE AND YOU HAVE YOUR LANTERN SLEEVE
GOaR6NnPmL0_1 0 IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO DISCUSS WHAT AN OCTAVE IS
GOaR6NnPmL0_2 0 ESSENTIALLY IF YOU START WITH A NOTE WHERE YOUR WAVE IS GOING ON HERE
GOaR6NnPmL0_3 0 WE ONLY REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT ONE FULL CYCLE BECAUSE IT'S JUST REPEATED ALL THE WAY DOWN THE STRING
GOaR6NnPmL0_4 0 AN OCTAVE WOULD MEAN IF YOU WOULD TAKE THIS WAVE LENGTH RIGHT HERE AND YOU DOUBLE THE FREQUENCY
GOaR6NnPmL0_5 0 WHICH WOULD MEAN INSTEAD OF HAVING THIS GOING ON YOU NOW COMPLETE THE WHOLE CYCLE HALF WAY THROUGH
GOaR6NnPmL0_6 0 SO HERE I'D BE GOING DOWN AND UP LIKE THAT
GOaR6NnPmL0_7 0 SO THIS WAVE THE ONE I JUST DREW WOULD BE AN OCTAVE HIGHER THAN THE ONE BEFORE IT
GOaR6NnPmL0_8 0 AN OCTAVE WOULD BE THE SAME NOTE
GOaR6NnPmL0_9 0 SO FOR EXAMPLE AN A NOTE IF THIS WAS AN A NOTE THIS WOULD ALSO BE AN A BUT AN OCTAVE HIGHER
GOaR6NnPmL0_10 0 SO FOR EXAMPLE BAH BAH BAH
GOaR6NnPmL0_11 0 THEY'RE BOTH AS BUT THIS ONE WOULD BE HIGHER BY WHAT'S CALLED AN OCTAVE
GpddDGG2oLU_1 0 THE RESCUE JACKET IS A VERY USEFUL TOOL AND IT CAN BE A WONDERFUL PIECE OF EQUIPMENT
GpddDGG2oLU_2 0 HOWEVER WITHIN THOSE USES SOME ARE EXTREMELY GOOD AND SOME WHILE BEING VERY USEFUL CAN BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS
GpddDGG2oLU_3 0 WHENEVER YOU'RE IN A RESCUE SITUATION YOU WANT TO TRY AND KEEP YOURSELF REMOVED FROM THE RIVER WITHOUT PUTTING YOURSELF TOO MUCH IN DANGER
GpddDGG2oLU_4 0 AND THE RESCUE JACKET IS ONE OF THOSE PIECES OF EQUIPMENT THAT WHEN USED IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS IS GOING TO PUT YOU RIGHT IN THE FRONT LINE
GpddDGG2oLU_5 0 THE FIRST AND BEST USE OF A RESCUE JACKET IS TO USING YOUR FLIP LINE
GpddDGG2oLU_6 0 CLIP YOURSELF INTO A TREE OR A BOULDER OR SOMETHING SOLID SO THAT YOU CAN USE IT AS A BELAY POINT OFF THE SHORE AND THAT WAY NOT MATTER HOW MUCH TENSION'S ON THAT ROPE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO LEAN AGAINST THE BOULDER OR THE TREE USING THE FLIP LINE AND IT'S NOT GOING TO GO ANYWHERE
GpddDGG2oLU_7 0 ANOTHER USE OF THE RESCUE JACKET IS WHAT WE CALL LIVE BAIT RESCUE OTHERWISE KNOWN AS DOPE ON A ROPE
GpddDGG2oLU_8 0 AND IN THIS CASE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A ROPE CLIPPED IN TO THE BACK HERE AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE DIVING OUT ATTACHED TO THE END OF THAT ROPE WITH SOMEONE ON SHORE HOLDING THE END
GpddDGG2oLU_9 0 WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO SWIM OUT TO SOMETHING BE IT AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON A BOAT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND GRAB THEM OR GET A LINE OUT TO THEM
GpddDGG2oLU_10 0 THAT'S A PARTICULARLY AGGRESSIVE RESCUE TECNIQUE AND SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO DO ONLY IF YOU REALLY TRUST THE PEOPLE ON SHORE THAT ARE BELAYING YOU
GpddDGG2oLU_11 0 ANOTHER USE IS A V-LOWER AND THIS IS A MORE CONTROLABLE WAY OF PUTTING YOURSELF ON THE END OF TWO LINES WHERE YOU'RE THEN AT THE POINT HERE AND YOU CAN BE MOVED BACK AND FORTH AND UP AND DOWN THE RIVER ON THE END OF THAT V ALL OF THESE WE WILL BE SHOWING YOU LATER
GpddDGG2oLU_12 0 ANOTHER BRILLIANT METHOD OF USING THIS JACKET IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY IN YOUR KAYAK OR IN YOUR CRAFT IS USING A TOW LINE
GpddDGG2oLU_13 0 AND THIS YOU'RE GOING TO BE TAKING IT OUT OF A POCKET AND CLIPPING IT ON TO SOMETHING WHILE YOU'RE ACTUALLY IN THERE SO YOU CAN THEN PADDLE FREELY USING BOTH HANDS
GpddDGG2oLU_14 0 ONE RULE TO REMEMBER THOUGH WHEN YOU'RE EVER CLIPPING INTO YOUR RESCUE JACKET IS THAT YOU ALWAYS USE A LOCKING CARABINER NOT ONLY IS IT LOCKING BUT WHEN YOU CLIP IT ON IT'S LOCKED AND YOU CHECK IT'S LOCKED AND THAT WAY IF IT SWINGS OFF TO THE SIDE IT'S NOT GONNA GET UNCLIPPED AND CLIP IN TO SOMETHING THAT WON'T RELEASE ON THE SIDE OF YOUR JACKET
gvcN8ZzwTVk_1 0 IN THIS CLIP WE WILL SHOW YOU ANOTHER STYLE OF MOVEMENT THAT ARE MORE UNDULATED
gvcN8ZzwTVk_3 0 SO FOR EXAMPLE IF WE ARE IN THIS POSITION IN PROFILE POSITION THE UNDULATION WILL START FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP
gvcN8ZzwTVk_4 0 AND THEN WE WILL JUST CONTRACT THE UPPER BODY SO THE UNDULATION GOES OUT OF YOUR BODY
gvcN8ZzwTVk_5 0 SO IT'S LIKE YOU'RE HAVING SOMETHING INSIDE YOUR BODY AND YOU LET IT GO OUT
gvcN8ZzwTVk_6 0 SO FIRST YOU BEND YOUR KNEES
gvcN8ZzwTVk_7 0 YOU MAKE THIS UNDULATION TRAVEL FROM YOUR KNEES TO YOUR HIPS FROM YOUR HIPS TO YOUR UPPER BODY UNTIL IT GOES OUT
gvcN8ZzwTVk_9 0 SO IT GOES ONE AND TWO
gvcN8ZzwTVk_10 0 AGAIN ONE AND TWO
gvcN8ZzwTVk_11 0 THIS TWO SHOULD BE STRETCHING YOUR KNEES AND THIS TWO BECAUSE UNDULATION ONCE IT PASSES THROUGH YOUR KNEES IT STARTS STRETCHING THEM
gvcN8ZzwTVk_12 0 AND WHEN YOU FINISH YOUR KNEES SHOULD BE ALREADY STRETCHED
gvcN8ZzwTVk_13 0 SO IT GOES BEND AND UP
gvcN8ZzwTVk_14 0 ONE AND TWO
gvcN8ZzwTVk_15 0 SO IT'S FLUID AND SHARP
gvcN8ZzwTVk_16 0 FLUID AND SHARP
gvcN8ZzwTVk_17 0 FLUID AND SHARP
gvcN8ZzwTVk_18 0 SO YOU HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF UNDULATION IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
gvcN8ZzwTVk_19 0 IT'S JUST THAT QUALITY THAT I NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND
Hg3OLKmBwhY_1 0 ALRIGHT THE DRINK WE ARE ABOUT TO MAKE IS CALLED THE FLAMING GORILLA
Hg3OLKmBwhY_2 0 AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS AS A SHOT AND MAKE SURE YOU DO IT IN THE ORDER THAT I AM ABOUT TO DO IT
Hg3OLKmBwhY_3 0 START OFF WITH ONE THIRD PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS
Hg3OLKmBwhY_4 0 THERE WE GO
Hg3OLKmBwhY_5 0 AND ONE THIRD KAHLUA
Hg3OLKmBwhY_6 0 AND NEXT WE'LL DO ONE THIRD OF ONE FIFTY ONE PROOF RUM
Hg3OLKmBwhY_7 0 THERE WE GO
Hg3OLKmBwhY_8 0 AND OF COURSE WHAT WOULD A FLAMING GORILLA BE WITHOUT SOME FLAMES
Hg3OLKmBwhY_9 0 GRAB A LIGHTER GRAB ANYTHING THAT WILL SET THESE ON FIRE AND DON'T WORRY I KNOW GORILLAS ARE ENDANGERED SPECIES BUT FLAMING GORILLAS ARE NOT
Hg3OLKmBwhY_10 0 GO AHEAD AND FIND A FRIEND AND AN AUDIENCE AND DON'T FORGET TO BLOW OUT THE FLAMES BEFORE YOU TAKE DOWN THE SHOT
Hg3OLKmBwhY_11 0 FLAMING GORILLA BOTTOMS UP
gVYPEzQLZUI_1 0 DR LIOR KANE HI
gVYPEzQLZUI_2 0 I'M DR KANE WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND AUTHOR OF HOW TO BECOME A PROFESSIONAL BACHELOR
gVYPEzQLZUI_3 0 YOU KNOW MEN ASK ALWAYS ME WHY IS IT THAT I HAVE TO CHASE THE WOMEN
gVYPEzQLZUI_4 0 AS A MATTER OF FACT BY BECOMING A PROFESSIONAL BACHELOR THE WOMEN WILL SEEK THE MEN
gVYPEzQLZUI_5 0 ONE OF THE TRICKS OF THE TRADE WHICH I REALLY REALLY BELIEVE IN IS DOING GOOD WORKS SUCH AS VOLUNTEER WORK
gVYPEzQLZUI_6 0 IN OTHER WORDS VOLUNTEER AT YOUR LOCAL HOSPITAL VOLUNTEER AT THE FOOD BANK VOLUNTEER AT THE SOUP KITCHEN
gVYPEzQLZUI_7 0 BELIEVE IT OR NOT THERE ARE TONS OF WOMEN WHO ARE NOT ONLY VOLUNTEERING AS WELL BUT ALSO SEEKING A MAN WHO HAS COMPASSION FOR LIFE AND COMPASSION FOR OTHERS
gVYPEzQLZUI_8 0 SO NOT ONLY ARE YOU DOING GOOD IN VOLUNTEERING AND HELPING SOCIETY OUT YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY ATTRACTING WOMEN LEFT AND RIGHT WITHOUT YOU EVEN KNOWING IT
gVYPEzQLZUI_9 0 TRUST ME WHEN YOU LEAVE THAT SOUP KITCHEN IN THE AFTERNOON THAT WOMAN OR THESE WOMEN THAT HAVE SEEN YOU ALL DAY WILL COME BEGGING FOR MORE ATTENTION
gVYPEzQLZUI_10 0 AGAIN WHEN THESE WOMEN SEEK OUT AFTER YOU'VE BEEN A DO-GOODER FOR THE DAY THE BOTTOM LINE IS DON'T GIVE INTO THEIR NEEDS RIGHT AWAY
gVYPEzQLZUI_11 0 TELL THEM YOU'RE BUSY AT ANOTHER VOLUNTEER EPISODE AND THAT YOU'LL GET TO THEM WHENEVER YOU CAN
gVYPEzQLZUI_12 0 MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW UP WITH THEIR E-MAIL AND THEIR NUMBER AND ALWAYS CALL THEM ON THE TELEPHONE
gVYPEzQLZUI_13 0 AVOID TEXT MESSAGING OR E-MAILING THEM DIRECTLY
gVYPEzQLZUI_14 0 THE BEST CONVERSATION IS DIRECTLY FACE-TO-FACE SECONDLY THE TELEPHONE
gVYPEzQLZUI_15 0 SO USE TECHNOLOGY TO YOUR BEST BUT USE HUMAN TOUCH AND ASPECT BECAUSE AGAIN YOU'RE VOLUNTEERING AT THE SOUP KITCHEN AND YOU NEED TO BE THERE
Gwb5TRtcGu4_1 0 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF MAKING YOUR OWN VERSUS BUYING A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT
Gwb5TRtcGu4_2 0 NOW I KNOW THAT THE PROSPECT OF MAKING YOUR OWN CLEANSER CAN SEEM A LITTLE DAUNTING BUT REALLY IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH EASIER THAN YOU WOULD THINK AND IT'S SO MUCH CHEAPER THAN BUYING OVER THE COUNTER
Gwb5TRtcGu4_3 0 IT CAN ALSO BE VERY REWARDING ONCE YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE PUTTING ON YOUR SKIN
Gwb5TRtcGu4_4 0 AS I MENTIONED FOR THE MOST PART MAKING YOUR OWN CAN BE CHEAPER THAN THE COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS
Gwb5TRtcGu4_5 0 IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THESE INGREDIENTS HERE AND GO INTO YOUR STORE YOU'LL REALIZE THAT ALL YOU'RE DOING IS BUYING VERY INEXPENSIVE PRODUCTS
Gwb5TRtcGu4_6 0 YOU'RE BUYING MILK HONEY AND OATS ALL OF WHICH YOU CAN PURCHASE AT JUST ABOUT ANY STORE AND PURCHASE AT JUST ABOUT ANY PRICE
Gwb5TRtcGu4_7 0 IF YOU GO TO BUY OVER THE COUNTER COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS THOSE ARE GOING TO BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE
Gwb5TRtcGu4_8 0 YOU CAN USUALLY SPEND UP TO FIVE DOLLARS SEVEN DOLLARS A BOTTLE
Gwb5TRtcGu4_9 0 AND FOR THIS YOU SPEND AT LEAST THAT MUCH FOR SO MUCH MORE
Gwb5TRtcGu4_10 0 THERE'S ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY IN COST THAT YOU CAN T FIND IF YOU BUY A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT
Gwb5TRtcGu4_11 0 IF YOU GO UP TO THE COUNTER ALL THERE IS IS ONE PRICE FOR THAT ONE BOTTLE
Gwb5TRtcGu4_12 0 WHEREAS IF YOU NEED TO SAVE A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND DO SOME SHOPPING AROUND AND FIND SOME CHEAPER MILK MAYBE FIND SOME CHEAPER HONEY MAYBE EVEN FIND A LOCAL BEEKEEPER WHO WILL SELL IT TO YOU FOR A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN IF YOU WERE TO BUY IT IN THE STORE
Gwb5TRtcGu4_13 0 YOU HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY THERE THAN IF YOU WERE TO JUST GO INTO THE DRUGSTORE PICK UP A BOTTLE OFF OF THE COUNTER THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SELL IT TO YOU ANY CHEAPER THAN WHAT IS ON THE LABEL
g8qogDYpMGI_1 0 MY NAME IS ANTHONY MADDALONI AND I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHY LIGHTING
g8qogDYpMGI_2 0 NOW FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHY CAN BE ANYWHERE FROM A CRIME SCENE TO INSIDE A MEDICAL EXAMINER'S LAB
g8qogDYpMGI_3 0 SO YOUR LIGHTING IS VERY EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU'RE REALLY PRESENTING FACTS
g8qogDYpMGI_4 0 ONE TYPE OF FLASH THAT I HAVE USED IN SOME TYPE OF FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHY IS A RING FLASH
g8qogDYpMGI_5 0 NOW THIS IS A FLASH THAT ACTUALLY GOES ON THE LENS OF MY CAMERA AND GETS EXTREMELY CLOSE TO WHAT I'M SHOOTING
g8qogDYpMGI_6 0 IF I WAS SHOOTING LET'S SAY A HAIR OR SOME TYPE OF EVIDENCE ON SOMEBODY'S HAND I WOULD WANT THAT RING FLASH BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO DIRECTLY HIT WHAT I'M PHOTOGRAPHING
g8qogDYpMGI_7 0 IF I WAS USING A FLASH THAT WAS MOUNTED ON TOP OF MY CAMERA UNLESS IT WAS HAND-HELD IT WOULD BE SORT OF DIFFICULT
g8qogDYpMGI_8 0 SO A RING FLASH IS THE TYPE OF LIGHTING THAT YOU WOULD REALLY LIKE TO USE FOR FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHY
g8qogDYpMGI_9 0 ONE ALSO TYPE OF LIGHTING THAT YOU COULD USE IS JUST STILL LIGHTS
g8qogDYpMGI_10 0 MOST OF THE TIME THEY'RE NOT USED BECAUSE FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHY IS REALLY THE TYPE OF LIGHTING YOU WANT TO USE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS HEAT-BASED
g8qogDYpMGI_11 0 HEAT WOULD NOT BE GOOD TO USE IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT
g8qogDYpMGI_12 0 SO YOU REALLY WANT TO STICK WITH A MORE ARTIFICIAL FLASH TYPE FOR FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHY
g8qogDYpMGI_13 0 AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TYPES OF LIGHTING THAT I WOULD USE FOR FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHY
GlsYa0DEXc0_1 0 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT ORIENTATION OF THE MOUNTAIN GETTING TO THE MOUNTAIN IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR WAY AROUND RIGHT AWAY JUST TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO LOOK AROUND
GlsYa0DEXc0_2 0 IF YOU RE JUST A BEGINNER YOU WANT TO BE SURE TO STAY TO THE AREAS WHERE THE PITCH OF THE MOUNTAIN IS A LOT LESS
GlsYa0DEXc0_3 0 THAT WAY YOU WON'T BE IN OVER YOUR HEAD OR PICK UP TOO MUCH SPEED WITHOUT WANTING TO
GlsYa0DEXc0_4 0 IF YOUR MORE OF AN ADVANCED SNOWBOARDER YOUR COMFORTABLE WITH YOUR CARVES AND TURNING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN FEEL FREE TO EXPLORE
GlsYa0DEXc0_5 0 THERE'S MORE CHALLENGING LIFTS THAT ACCESS STEEPER PITCH AREAS
GlsYa0DEXc0_6 0 THE RUNS GO FROM GREEN AS THE EASIEST TO BLUE BLACK AND DOUBLE BLACK DIAMOND BEING THE HARDEST
GlsYa0DEXc0_7 0 DON T BE INTIMIDATED BY THE SIGNS OR WHAT IT SAYS IT IS
GlsYa0DEXc0_8 0 TRUST YOURSELF AND GO FOR IT
gMFxIZ3fST0_1 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO APPLY THE WHITE BASE PAINT TO THE BOXES
gMFxIZ3fST0_2 0 AND THIS WILL HELP US GIVE A SOLID WHITE COLOR TO THE BOXES AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO DECORATE THEM ACCORDINGLY
gMFxIZ3fST0_3 0 SO WE CAN SEE AS WE APPLY THIS WHITE PAINT IT'S A VERY THICK HEAVY PAINT AND IT COVERS ALL THE MARKS ON OUR BOX
gMFxIZ3fST0_4 0 SO THIS WAY WE WON'T BE LEFT WITH ANY TYPE OF WRITING OR COLORS UNDERNEATH THE COLORS WE WANT TO USE TO DECORATE OUR BOX
gMFxIZ3fST0_5 0 DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU HAVE UNDERNEATH YOU DON'T REALLY NEED MORE THAN ONE COAT
gMFxIZ3fST0_6 0 BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME VERY DARK IMAGES UNDERNEATH THAT STILL LOOK LIKE THEIR COMING THROUGH SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO WAIT UNTIL IT DRIES AND THEN YOU CAN APPLY AND TOUCH UP IN CERTAIN AREAS A SECOND COAT
gMFxIZ3fST0_7 0 DON'T APPLY TOO MUCH BECAUSE IT IS A VERY THICK PAINT AND IT GOES ON VERY HEAVY
gMFxIZ3fST0_8 0 ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE TO TAKE SOME COLORED PAPER AND JUST COVER THE AREAS WE CAN GLUE THE AREAS AROUND WITH COLOR CARDBOARD
gMFxIZ3fST0_9 0 AND OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD SKIP THE WHOLE STEPS OF PAINTING THE BOXES EVEN THOUGH THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO JUST COVER IT WITH COLORED PAPER
gMFxIZ3fST0_10 0 LEAVING OUT THE PAINT FROM THIS PROJECT IS KIND OF A DOWN SIDE FOR KIDS WHO REALLY ENJOY PAINTING
gMFxIZ3fST0_11 0 SO I'M SURE THEY'LL ENJOY MUCH MORE GOING THROUGH THESE STEPS OF COVERING THE BOX AND COLORING IT
gMFxIZ3fST0_12 0 BUT AGAIN IF YOU'RE SHORT ON TIME OR YOU JUST WANT TO USE WHAT MATERIALS YOU HAVE AVAILABLE TO YOU IT COULD ALSO BE COLORED IN THAT WAY
gMFxIZ3fST0_13 0 JUST BY PAINTING DIFFERENT BY PASTING TAPING DIFFERENT COLORED PAPER AROUND THE BOX
gMFxIZ3fST0_14 0 YOU'D GET THE SAME EFFECT
gMFxIZ3fST0_15 0 SO YOU CAN SEE THIS PAINT REALLY COVERS UP WHAT'S UNDERNEATH
gMFxIZ3fST0_16 0 SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO NECESSARILY LOOK SPECIFICALLY FOR BOXES THAT DON'T HAVE ANY IMAGES ON THEM OR ARE TOTALLY CLEAN
gMFxIZ3fST0_17 0 YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS PAINT REALLY GIVES A VERY THICK LAYER THAT WILL LET THE COLORS THAT YOU PUT ON TOP OF IT SHINE THROUGH
HGau-Xi6D_k_1 0 THE NEXT STEP IS TO BRING YOUR MANUAL UP TO A HIGHER LOCATION
HGau-Xi6D_k_2 0 ONE THING TO SKATE IS BENCHES OR MAYBE EVEN THE TOPS OF SMALL PICNIC TABLES THAT YOU CAN JUMP UP ONTO OLLIE UP ONTO
HGau-Xi6D_k_3 0 THIS ONE HERE IS A GOOD NEXT HEIGHT
HGau-Xi6D_k_4 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN OLLIE AS HIGH AS THE SPOT IT IS SO PRACTICE DOING A BUNCH OF OLLIE'S ONTO IT AND GET THAT PERFECTED
HGau-Xi6D_k_5 0 THEN YOU'LL WANT TO OLLIE UP INTO THE MANUAL POSITION
HGau-Xi6D_k_6 0 LAND IN MANUAL
HGau-Xi6D_k_7 0 KEEP YOUR FEET IN A NICE GENERAL POSITION AND USE YOUR UPPER BODY TO ADJUST AND HOLD THE MANUAL FOR THE WHOLE DISTANCE OF THE TOP OF THE PAD
HGau-Xi6D_k_8 0 ONCE YOU GET THAT DOWN THE MANUALING PART YOU COULD MAYBE EVEN LEARN HOW TO PERFECT A SMALL OLLIE OUT OF THE MANUAL AT THE END OR YOU COULD JUST COAST OFF AND RIDE AWAY FROM THE MANUAL
HGau-Xi6D_k_9 0 YOU LEARN HOW TO OLLIE INTO THE HEIGHT THAT YOU HAVE
HGau-Xi6D_k_10 0 OLLIE UP ON TOP
HGau-Xi6D_k_11 0 LAND IN A MANUAL
HGau-Xi6D_k_12 0 HOLD THE MANUAL
HGau-Xi6D_k_13 0 ADJUST WITH YOUR WEIGHT AND THEN OLLIE OUT OR COAST OUT OF THE MANUAL
GPpCdPIU568_1 0 HI ON BEHALF OF EXPERTVILLAGE.COM I'M SHELLY AT AA CALLISTER AT SALT LAKE CITY UTAH AND I WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW TO GET THE BEST TURNOUT BLANKET FOR YOUR MONEY
GPpCdPIU568_2 0 NOW THERE ARE THREE THINGS YOU WANT TO CONSIDER WHEN PURCHASING A TURNOUT BLANKET
GPpCdPIU568_3 0 ONE IS GOING TO BE THE OUTER COVERING
GPpCdPIU568_4 0 THE OUTER COVERING IS VERY IMPORTANT ON A TURNOUT BLANKET BECAUSE THAT IS GOING TO TELL YOU WHETHER THAT IS WATER RESISTANT WATERPROOF WINDPROOF
GPpCdPIU568_5 0 THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO COME ABOUT BY THE OUTER LAYER OF THE TURNOUT BLANKET
GPpCdPIU568_6 0 INSIDE THE TURNOUT BLANKET NEXT TO THE HORSE'S SKIN WE HAVE A LINING THAT IS RIGHT NEXT TO THE HORSE'S SKIN
GPpCdPIU568_7 0 THIS ONE HAS A SOFT NYLON LINING
GPpCdPIU568_8 0 WE WILL GO INTO LINING IN A MINUTE BUT THIS IS RIGHT NEXT TO THE HORSE'S SKIN
GPpCdPIU568_9 0 IN BETWEEN THE LINING AND THE OUTER COVERING IS THE INSULATION
GPpCdPIU568_10 0 WE WILL GO INTO INSULATION A LITTLE BIT LATER ALSO
GPpCdPIU568_11 0 BUT THOSE ARE GOING TO BE THREE THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN PURCHASING A TURNOUT BLANKET SO THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE GETTING THE MOST BLANKET FOR YOUR BUCK AND IF YOU HAVE PURCHASED SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE RIGHT FOR YOUR ELEMENTS AND YOUR CLIMATE AND YOUR HORSE
gj_clsvISbo_1 0 OKAY SOMETIMES IN SQUASH YOUR OPPONENT PUTS YOU UNDER A GREAT PRESSURE AND SO AS WE'VE SHOWN YOUR TRADITIONAL BACK HAND DROP SHOT WILL BE SOMEWHAT LIKE A MINI GROUND STROKE OR MINI VOLLEY IT'LL BE LIKE THAT
gj_clsvISbo_2 0 BUT IF YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE A LONG RUN OR YOUR OPPONENT EXCELLENTLY WELL EXECUTED SHOT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO WHAT I CALL SOMEWHAT OF A FENCING SHOT
gj_clsvISbo_3 0 SO IF YOU HAVE YOUR RACKET LIKE THAT IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY'S FENCING
gj_clsvISbo_4 0 SO YOU HAVE THE RACKET SO THEY'VE HIT THIS GREAT SHOT AND YOU'RE VIRTUALLY AT A DEAD RUN AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME IN AND YOU PUT THE RACKET OUT AND YOU GET RIGHT UNDERNEATH IT
gj_clsvISbo_5 0 SO WHAT THAT DOES IS THE RACKET JUST PUSHES THE BALL RIGHT ABOVE THE TIN
gj_clsvISbo_6 0 SO IT'S A REALLY GOOD SHOT BECAUSE NOW IF YOUR OPPONENT'S HIT A GREAT SHOT BUT YOU'VE GOT THERE AND NOW YOU'VE DROPPED IT YOU'RE ACTUALLY COUNTER DROPPING OR IT COULD OF BEEN OFF OF BOTH BUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS COUNTERING AND YOU'VE GOT THERE AND YOU'VE PUT A NICE SOFT TOUCH ON IT SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY REVERSE THE SITUATION YOU'RE IN
gj_clsvISbo_7 0 AND THE SAME GOES FOR THE FOREHAND SIDE SO INSTEAD OF THIS ARM GUARD IT'S LIKE THAT
gj_clsvISbo_8 0 SO YOUR OPPONENT HITS A PRETTY GOOD SHOT AND YOU JUST SEE I'VE JUST KEPT THE RACKET ON THERE I'M NOT DOING IT LIKE A DROP SHOT A MORE TRADITIONAL ONE I'VE GOT MY RACKET OUT AND I'M JUST USING THE STRINGS I'M JUST BLOCKING THE BALL SO IT JUST GOES RIGHT ABOVE THE TIN
gj_clsvISbo_9 0 SO IT'S JUST LIKE THIS IT'S NOTHING GREAT BUT IT'S A REALLY EFFECTIVE SHOT FOR WHEN YOU'RE UNDER GREAT PRESSURE
gj_clsvISbo_10 0 AND YOU CAN ALSO ADD A LOB OPTION TO EITHER ONE OF THESE SHOTS WHICH WE'LL EXPLAIN IN A DIFFERENT SEGMENT
gj_clsvISbo_11 0 BUT YOU GET DOWN AND YOU CAN EITHER PUSH IT UP OR YOU JUST GO ALL THE WAY ON EITHER SIDE AND YOU GET A LOB TOO SO IT'S A VERY EFFECTIVE SHOT FOR TURNING THE TABLES ON YOUR OPPONENT
GrNCKxAjyAM_1 0 IN THIS SECTION I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW TO START OFF ON THE BREAST STROKE
GrNCKxAjyAM_2 0 SO WHAT YOU'LL WANT TO DO IS IMAGINE MY HANDS BEING YOUR FEET
GrNCKxAjyAM_3 0 YOU'LL BRING THEM UP YOU KNOW
GrNCKxAjyAM_4 0 IMAGINE MY CHEST BEING YOUR BUTTOCKS
GrNCKxAjyAM_5 0 YOU'LL BRING YOUR HAND LEGS UP TO YOUR BUTTOCKS LIKE THIS AND THEN YOU'LL END UP DOING A COMPLETE FULL-CIRCLE CLOSE WITH THE BREAST STROKE
GrNCKxAjyAM_6 0 LET ME SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THAT AS WELL AND ON YOUR FEET
GrNCKxAjyAM_7 0 IT'S CALLED THE FROG KICK BUT SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU'LL BRING YOUR HEEL STRAIGHT UP TO YOUR BUTT RIGHT AND YOUR LEG IS STRAIGHT DOWN
GrNCKxAjyAM_8 0 SO LET ME SHOW YOU ON THE SIDE LIKE THIS AND THEN WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO END UP DOING IS POINTING IT OUT FORTY-FIVE DEGREES AND THEN CLOSING IN ON A FULL CIRCLE BUT THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO ON THE FROG KICK IS JUST BRING YOUR HEEL STRAIGHT UP TO YOUR BUTT LIKE THAT
GrNCKxAjyAM_9 0 AND THAT'S HOW YOU WOULD START OFF ON THE FROG KICK FOR THAT SECTION
GrNCKxAjyAM_10 0 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WITH MY FEET AND THAT'S THE FULL FULL BREAST STROKE KICK RIGHT THERE
GrNCKxAjyAM_11 0 AND THEN I'LL SHOW YOU STEP BY STEP HERE IN A BIT
h8Y1ZT0U47Y_1 0 NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO SOME SIMPLE REPAIRS ON YOUR OWN
h8Y1ZT0U47Y_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO START OFF WITH OUR NECK HERE
h8Y1ZT0U47Y_3 0 THE NECK OCTAVE MECHANISM IS KIND OF A TRICKY THING BUT IT WILL MAKE YOUR INSTRUMENT NOT PLAY PROPERLY IF IT'S NOT CORRECT
h8Y1ZT0U47Y_4 0 IF IT IS STICKING OPEN JUST A LITTLE BIT IT'S VERY SIMPLE JUST GO AHEAD AND PUT YOUR HAND ON TOP OF THE INSTRUMENT HERE
h8Y1ZT0U47Y_5 0 AND I'M RIGHT HANDED WE'LL PUT IT ON TOP OF THE INSTRUMENT AND JUST KIND OF PUSH DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT AND THAT SHOULD MAKE YOUR KEY CLOSE
h8Y1ZT0U47Y_6 0 IF THAT DOESN'T THEN THERE DEFINITELY IS PROBABLY SOMETHING WRONG OR SOME CORK MISSING OR SUCH AND YOU PROBABLY WOULD WANT TO TAKE IT IN AT THAT POINT
h8Y1ZT0U47Y_7 0 NEXT IS THE G SHARP KEY A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR G SHARP KEY
h8Y1ZT0U47Y_8 0 JUST ONE OF THOSE KEYS THAT LIKES TO STICK A LOT
h8Y1ZT0U47Y_9 0 NOW IF YOU'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU CAN NOT TAKE IT IN I WOULD DEFINITELY TAKE A YOUR DOLLAR BILL AND YOUR BABY POWDER
h8Y1ZT0U47Y_10 0 AND IF YOU'RE A SAXOPHONE PLAYER I WOULD JUST PROBABLY KEEP THESE IN YOUR CASE BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS A DESIGN FLAW ON A SAXOPHONE WHICH THEY HAVE NOW REPAIRED WITH SOME NEWER MODELS OF CERTAIN SAXOPHONES
h8Y1ZT0U47Y_11 0 BUT THIS ONE UNFORTUNATELY DOESN'T HAVE ONE
h8Y1ZT0U47Y_12 0 SHAKE OFF THE EXCESS AND THEN WE JUST WANT TO GO AHEAD AND LIFT UP THE KEY WITH THE PAD STICK THE DOLLAR BILL UNDER IT PRESS DOWN ON THE KEY AND PULL IT OUT
h8Y1ZT0U47Y_13 0 AND YOU CAN DO THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN AS NEEDED TO HELP THAT KEY FROM STICKING
h8Y1ZT0U47Y_14 0 AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK YOU PROBABLY NEED YOUR PAD REPLACED
h8Y1ZT0U47Y_15 0 AS WELL AS IF YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF TRAUMA TO YOUR KEY GUARDS THIS IS ANOTHER THING
h8Y1ZT0U47Y_16 0 SOME TIMES IF THEY GET BENT DOWN REAL FAR YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO OPEN YOU KEY
h8Y1ZT0U47Y_17 0 SO YOU CAN BE ABLE TO TAKE YOUR FLAT NOSE PLIERS HERE AND JUST GRAB A HOLD AND LIFT IF UP EVER SO SLIGHTLY
h8Y1ZT0U47Y_18 0 JUST TRY TO DO IT AS GENTLY AS YOU CAN FOR THE TIME BEING UNTIL YOU CAN GET IT SOMEBODY THAT CAN STRAIGHTEN THAT OUT INDEFINITELY FOR YOU
h8Y1ZT0U47Y_19 0 AND THOSE ARE SOME QUICK FIXES THAT YOU CAN DO ON YOUR SAXOPHONE
HiMH-JDTdM4_1 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS FOR THESE TIGHT CURVES OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T USE THE BELT LIKE THIS AND THIS ONE IS TOO BIG
HiMH-JDTdM4_2 0 SO WHAT YOU CAN USE YOU CAN USE THE CORNER OF THE WHEEL AND USE IT TO GRIND OUT THAT SECTION AND THEN IT WILL END UP LOOKING LIKE THIS
HiMH-JDTdM4_3 0 IT'S NOT A PERFECT GRIND
HiMH-JDTdM4_4 0 WE USE ANOTHER TOOL FOR THAT BUT AS YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN START TO BRING IT IN AND USE THAT TO CLEAN OUT MOST OF THE BULK
HiMH-JDTdM4_5 0 ONCE YOU GET IT BASICALLY TO YOUR SHAPE WE HAVE ANOTHER TOOL THAT WILL CLEAN THAT OUT
HiMH-JDTdM4_6 0 THIS IS THE GRINDER THAT I USE TO DO THE LITTLE FINGER CUT OUTS
HiMH-JDTdM4_7 0 IT HAS A ONE INCH WHEEL ON THE TOP AND IT FITS PERFECTLY INTO WHERE I WANT MY FINGER CUT OUT SO I USE IT TO ROUND THIS PART BACK HERE
HiMH-JDTdM4_8 0 IT DOESN'T TAKE VERY LONG BECAUSE I'VE GOT MOST OF THE BULK OUT
HiMH-JDTdM4_9 0 SO MAKE SURE YOU WEAR YOUR GLASSES GRIND TOWARDS THE BUCKET
HiMH-JDTdM4_10 0 THIS MACHINE ACTUALLY HAS A SPEED ADJUSTMENT SO I CAN ADJUST THE SPEED THAT I NEED TO GRIND AT
heifl42yp2w_1 0 SHAUN SCHAEFER HI I'M SHAUN SCHAEFER ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
heifl42yp2w_2 0 AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO SET UP A DRUM KIT
heifl42yp2w_3 0 NOW THAT WE HAVE OUR KICK DRUM SET UP OUR SNARE DRUM AND OUR RACK TOM NOW IT'S TIME TO SET UP OUR FINAL DRUM THE FLOOR TOM
heifl42yp2w_4 0 SO ON THIS DRUM THIS IS AN OLDER DRUM SO YOU KIND OF IT'S DIFFERENT
heifl42yp2w_5 0 MOST DRUMS HAVE A SCREW HERE THAT YOU JUST UNTIGHTEN OR TIGHTEN WITH YOUR FINGER
heifl42yp2w_6 0 I HAVE TO USE A DRUM KEY WHICH BASICALLY COMES WITH ANY DRUM SET
heifl42yp2w_7 0 SO I'M GOING TO LOOSEN THIS AND PULL THIS OUT TO WHERE I THINK ABOUT IT LOOKS CORRECT
heifl42yp2w_8 0 LIKE I SAID I'VE SET THIS DRUM KIT UP SO MANY TIMES THAT AND WE'LL ADJUST IT LATER IF IT'S NOT THE RIGHT HEIGHT
heifl42yp2w_9 0 SO THAT'S ONE
heifl42yp2w_10 0 THERE'S THREE LEGS ON EVERY FLOOR TOM
heifl42yp2w_11 0 LIKE I SAID THIS IS KIND OF A PAIN
heifl42yp2w_12 0 THE OLDER DRUM KIT THE HARDWARE IS NOT THE BEST ON THE LEGS AND STUFF
heifl42yp2w_13 0 TIGHTEN THAT ONE AND THEN ONE MORE
heifl42yp2w_14 0 LET ME TAKE THAT DOWN ABOUT RIGHT THERE JUST EYEBALLING IT
heifl42yp2w_15 0 AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT DOWN AND SEE WHERE WE'RE AT AND SEE IF WE'RE EVEN CLOSE
heifl42yp2w_16 0 AND THAT'S A LITTLE OFF AS YOU CAN MAYBE SEE
heifl42yp2w_17 0 IT'S KIND OF SLANTING THAT WAY
heifl42yp2w_18 0 WE'RE GOING TO LOWER THIS LEG RIGHT HERE AND GET MORE OF THE ANGLE THAT I WANT
heifl42yp2w_19 0 AND THEN I'M GOING TO FLIP IT LIKE THIS AND THAT LOOKS ABOUT RIGHT
h55Pdut4MA4_1 0 SENDING STUFF BACK HOME IS ALSO AN OPTION
h55Pdut4MA4_2 0 ON SOME OF MY TOURS YOU GO FROM PLACES WHERE IT IS COLD TO PLACES WHERE IT IS HOT
h55Pdut4MA4_3 0 AND SO YOU START GOING TO THE POST OFFICES IN TOWN AND SENDING HOME THE COLD WEATHER GEAR YOU DON'T NEED AND I HAVE ACTUALLY SENT HOME SOME OTHER STUFF
h55Pdut4MA4_4 0 ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE SENT HOME IS ONCE I GOT THROUGH THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS WHERE THERE IS A LOT LESS CIVILIZATION I SENT HOME MY WATER FILTER
h55Pdut4MA4_5 0 BUT WHILE I WAS IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS WHEN YOU ARE IN UTAH AND IN THE DESERT AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE CIVILIZATION AROUND A WATER FILTER IS A REALLY NICE THING TO HAVE
h55Pdut4MA4_6 0 I HAVE FILTERED WATER FROM UNDER RAILROAD TRESTLES UNDER FREEWAYS YOU CAN'T BELIEVE WHERE I HAVE GOTTEN WATER AND YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE GOT A GOOD WATER FILTER LIKE THIS ONE IS YOU TEND TO BE PRETTY MUCH O'KAY IF THE FILTER TECHNOLOGY IS PRETTY GOOD ON THESE FILTERS NOW
h55Pdut4MA4_7 0 ONE THING TO BRING ALONG NOW MAYBE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BRING THE WHOLE FILTER IS JUST IODINE TABLETS
h55Pdut4MA4_8 0 IN A PINCH IT IS A LOT LESS WEIGHT AND BULK IN A FILTER AND IN A PINCH YOU CAN JUST CHOOSE IODINE TABLETS TO MAKE SURE YOUR WATER IS REASONABLY POTABLE
h55Pdut4MA4_9 0 BUT SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT GOES ALONG WITH THE KITCHEN KIT AND YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THAT WATER FILTER IF YOU THINK YOU NEED IT
h55Pdut4MA4_10 0 AGAIN MOST AREAS ARE INHABITED ENOUGH
h55Pdut4MA4_11 0 YOU KNOW I CERTAINLY HAVE A WATER FILTER IN VIRGINIA KENTUCKY MISSOURI OR KANSAS BUT PLACES LIKE UTAH NEVADA WYOMING MONTANA OUT HERE IN THE WEST A WATER FILTER CAN PROVE TO BE SOMETHING THAT GETS YOU THAT SWEET NECTAR OF LIFE WHEN YOU REALLY REALLY NEED IT
guRLm8Foh6w_1 0 I'M DR JOE NEELY I PRACTICE WITH THE BARTON OAKS DENTAL GROUP
guRLm8Foh6w_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SAFETY OF TOOTH WHITENING PRODUCTS
guRLm8Foh6w_3 0 THE GREATEST RISK IN TOOTH WHITENING PRODUCT USED IS CREATING HYPERSENSITIVE TEETH
guRLm8Foh6w_4 0 PEOPLE THAT HAVE A HISTORY OF HYPERSENSITIVE TEETH NEED TO SOLVE THAT ISSUE BEFORE THEY USE ANY HOME BLEACHING PRODUCTS ESPECIALLY HOME PRODUCTS THAT ARE HARD TO CONTROL
guRLm8Foh6w_5 0 YOU CAN USE THE POWER ZOOM AND LASER WHITENING IN OFFICE AND BE PARTICULARLY CAREFUL OF COVERING UP ANY AREAS WHERE YOUR ENAMEL IS THIN OR RESTRUCTURE IS EXPOSED CERTAINLY COVERING UP YOUR GUM TISSUE MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN YOU CAN A PERSON WITH SENSITIVE TEETH CAN BLEACH USING A HOME PRODUCT
guRLm8Foh6w_6 0 BLEACH DOES NOT EFFECT THE STRENGTH OF THE TOOTH BUT IF YOU HAVE A HYPERSENSITIVE TOOTH BECAUSE THE ENAMEL IS VERY THIN OR YOU HAVE EXPOSED ROOT STRUCTURE THE BLEACH AGAINST THOSE STRUCTURES WILL CAUSE AN ALREADY HYPERSENSITIVE TOOTH TO REACT AND INFLAME EVEN MORE
guRLm8Foh6w_7 0 IF YOU DO HAVE SENSITIVITY THERE ARE FLUORIDES AND OTHER DESENSITIZING AGENTS THAT ARE MADE TO SOOTH THE TOOTH YOU CAN USE YOUR BLEACH LESS OFTEN BUT YOU CAN'T IGNORE A HYPERSENSITIVE TOOTH
guRLm8Foh6w_8 0 IN TERMS OF LONGEVITY OF BLEACHING PRODUCTS AFTER THE INITIAL BLEACHING PHASE WHICH CAN LAST UP TO THREE WEEKS THERE IS NO DATA ON ANYONE WHO USES BLEACHING PRODUCTS FOR TOUCH UP MORE OFTEN THAN ONCE A MONTH
guRLm8Foh6w_9 0 SO YOU WANT TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL AFTER YOUR INITIAL BLEACHING THAT YOU DON'T OVERDO YOUR TOUCH UP
gqdh_ETC5uA_1 0 CLANCY ROSE GO AHEAD AND STOP IT ONCE THAT BASKET IS FULL THE NEXT THING THAT I DO IS SETTLE THE COFFEE WHICH IS THIS MOTION HERE AND I SETTLE IT USUALLY A COUPLE OF TIMES
gqdh_ETC5uA_2 0 ONE THING IS EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT YOU SETTLE IT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIT ANOTHER GRAM OF COFFEE IN THE BASKET AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU DO THAT
gqdh_ETC5uA_3 0 NOW THAT I'VE SETTLED IT I CAN FIT A LITTLE MORE COFFEE IN THERE AND I'LL DOSE A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THERE
gqdh_ETC5uA_4 0 NOW THAT'S IT'S FILLED UP TAKE OFF THE TOP HERE REMEMBER TO LEVEL OFF THE COFFEE IN THE BASKET AND I'M JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND LEVEL IT OFF AND PUT IT RIGHT BACK INTO THE DOSING CHAMBER AND THEN WE CAN DUMP IT LATER
gqdh_ETC5uA_5 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO BE DOING IS NOT ONLY LEVELING IT OFF SO THAT YOU HAVE A NICE EVEN FLAT SURFACE ON THE TOP OF THE BASKET BUT ALSO KIND OF PUSH AROUND THE COFFEE IN THE BASKET SO THAT THE COFFEE IS COMPLETELY EVENLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BASKET
gqdh_ETC5uA_6 0 KIND OF WIPE IT OFF HERE
gqdh_ETC5uA_7 0 THE REASON THAT YOU DO THAT IS SO THAT YOU GET A COFFEE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED IF YOU HAVE A COFFEE IN ONE AREA OF THE PUCK THAT IS LESS EVENLY DISTRIBUTED YOU HAVE LESS COFFEE THAN ANOTHER AREA IN THE PUCK AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE THAT THE WATER IS GOING TO TRAVEL THROUGH WHEN YOU'RE BREWING AN ESPRESSO WHICH IS AN EXTRACTION FLAW WHICH IS GOING TO END UP IN THE END PRODUCT OF THE CUP OF ESPRESSO
h4UT3ywS2_4_1 0 SONJIA CUHER ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE THIS IS SONJIA CUHER
h4UT3ywS2_4_2 0 RAINCOAT YOU MAY LAUGH BUT THIS IS MY RAINCOAT IT'S A PLASTIC BAG AND I PAY FOR IT A DOLLAR
h4UT3ywS2_4_3 0 A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I GOT A REALLY EXPENSIVE COAT A GORE-TEX AND IT RAINED THE WHOLE I MEAN THE WHOLE WEEK THAT I WAS IN THERE IN THE HIGHLANDS SO NO MATTER HOW EXPENSIVE WAS MY COAT I BROUGHT MY PLASTIC BAG THAT'S THE BEST THING IT WORKS GREAT YOU DON'T GET WET I MEAN YOU WILL SWEAT BUT THIS WILL PROTECT YOU
h4UT3ywS2_4_4 0 REMEMBER PERUVIAN CLIMATE IT VARIES
h4UT3ywS2_4_5 0 WE ONLY HAVE TWO SEASONS DRY SEASON AND WET SEASON
h4UT3ywS2_4_6 0 THE DRY SEASON IT'S COLD AND IT DRY
h4UT3ywS2_4_7 0 AND THE WET SEASON YOU WILL GET WET
h4UT3ywS2_4_8 0 IT'S REALLY IT RAINS YOU KNOW IT POURS LIKE CATS AND DOGS THAT'S THE EXPRESSION
h4UT3ywS2_4_9 0 AND ALSO REMEMBER WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CLIMATES BECAUSE OVER THE CORDILLERA ALL THE RANGE
h4UT3ywS2_4_10 0 SO BY THE COASTLINE WE HAVE JUST SORT OF LIKE A MILE WINTER MILE SUMMER
h4UT3ywS2_4_11 0 IN THE HIGHLANDS DRY AND WET AND IN THE HIGHLANDS ALWAYS HOT AND WET
gEoJ_Jf47eA_1 0 WHEN UNDERSTANDING BUS AND THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT EVERY TIME YOU CREATE A BUS IT'S SENDING A SIGNAL TO ANOTHER TRACK THAT YOU CREATE
gEoJ_Jf47eA_2 0 SO WHEN I LOOK AT MY MY CHANNEL STRIP I LOOK AT MY SENDS AND I ASSIGN A SEND TO A BUS
gEoJ_Jf47eA_3 0 I'M GOING TO CHOOSE BUS ONE
gEoJ_Jf47eA_4 0 WHAT HAPPENS IS IT'S GOING TO CREATE AN AUXILIARY TRACK
gEoJ_Jf47eA_5 0 THIS IS ANOTHER TRACK THAT THE SIGNAL IS GOING TO GO THROUGH
gEoJ_Jf47eA_6 0 SO WHEN I PLAY IT THROUGH THIS FIRST ONE I HIT PLAY IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE PLAYING HERE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH I ACTUALLY BUS IT
gEoJ_Jf47eA_7 0 I CAN CONTROL THE LEVEL THAT IT'S BUSED OUT WITH WITH THIS DIAL RIGHT HERE
gEoJ_Jf47eA_8 0 IT'S ACTUALLY WILL CONTROL THIS AWAY
gEoJ_Jf47eA_9 0 I'M GOING TO HIT PLAY AND THEN SLOWLY BRING IT UP
gEoJ_Jf47eA_10 0 SO THAT'S LIKE THE BASIC CONCEPT OF BUSING
gEoJ_Jf47eA_11 0 THIS ALLOWS YOU TO DO CERTAIN THINGS LIKE BRINGING A BUNCH OF TRACKS TOGETHER SO YOU CAN EFFECT THEM ALL AT ONCE YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING
gEoJ_Jf47eA_12 0 YOU COULD ALSO DO CERTAIN THINGS LIKE PUT REVERBS EFFECTS SUCH AS DELAYS AND ANY TYPE OF MODULATION
gsE5eVP7poQ_1 0 AFTER YOU'VE DECIDED WHICH GLAZE TO USE
gsE5eVP7poQ_2 0 LIKE I HAVE
gsE5eVP7poQ_3 0 I'M GOING TO USE TEAL BLUE AND WHEAT FIELD
gsE5eVP7poQ_4 0 OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A PRETTY BLUE COLOR
gsE5eVP7poQ_5 0 IT'S VERY BEAUTIFUL
gsE5eVP7poQ_6 0 AND THIS WHEAT FIELD IS CLOSE TO THIS TONE
gsE5eVP7poQ_7 0 IT'S LIKE A SAND COLOR
gsE5eVP7poQ_8 0 SO YOU WANT TO SHAKE THEM UP REALLY REALLY WELL
gsE5eVP7poQ_10 0 THAT WAY ALL THE PIECES AND PARTICLES AT THE BOTTOM MIX WITH THE TOP
gsE5eVP7poQ_11 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF STIRRER
gsE5eVP7poQ_12 0 I USE THIS RIGHT HERE ACTUALLY
gsE5eVP7poQ_13 0 JUST TO MIX IT TOGETHER SO THAT YOUR APPLICATION IS EVEN
gsE5eVP7poQ_14 0 SOMETIMES IT'S PRETTY THICK
gsE5eVP7poQ_15 0 IF IT'S TOO THICK ADD WATER
gsE5eVP7poQ_16 0 JUST SLOW AMOUNTS OF WATER
gsE5eVP7poQ_17 0 IF YOU ADD TOO MUCH OBVIOUSLY THE COLOR'S NOT GOING TO BE AS NICE AND RICH AS YOU WANT IT
gsE5eVP7poQ_18 0 SO YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE TO GET ALL OF THE GLAZE MIXED REALLY WELL
gsE5eVP7poQ_19 0 AGAIN THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT
gsE5eVP7poQ_20 0 I'VE LEARNED THE HARD WAY WITH THIS
gsE5eVP7poQ_21 0 SO ONCE YOU'VE MIXED IT WELL I'M GOING TO PUT THE TEAL BLUE ON THE OUTSIDE AND THE WHEAT FIELD ON THE INTERIOR
gsE5eVP7poQ_22 0 DECIDE WHAT PAINT BRUSH
gsE5eVP7poQ_23 0 THIS IS THE SIZE OF MY PIECE SO I'M GOING TO NEED A SMALL PAINTBRUSH BUT I LIKE THICKER BRUSHES THAT WAY THEY PUT IN MORE CLAY
gsE5eVP7poQ_24 0 SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH THE INTERIOR OF MY CANDY JAR
Gb2otmCS8Dc_1 0 HELLO MY NAME IS SCOTT AND I'M THE OWNER OF CLIMB ON INDOOR ROCK CLIMBING GYM OF WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA
Gb2otmCS8Dc_2 0 TODAY WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS HOW TO BUY A ROCK CLIMBING SHOE
Gb2otmCS8Dc_3 0 THERE ARE SEVERAL TYPES OF DIFFERENT ROCK CLIMBING SHOES OUT THERE LOTS OF DIFFERENT BRAND NAMES AND COMPANIES
Gb2otmCS8Dc_4 0 ROCK CLIMBING IS INHERENTLY DANGEROUS AND CAN RESULT IN SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH SO ANY TIME THAT YOU BEGIN TO GET INTO THE SPORT OR BUY SOME SHOES OR SOME EQUIPMENT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET THE PROPER INSTRUCTION AT YOUR LOCAL INDOOR CLIMBING GYM
Gb2otmCS8Dc_5 0 THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENCES IN SHOES
Gb2otmCS8Dc_6 0 YOU'VE GOT LACE UPS AND VELCROS
Gb2otmCS8Dc_7 0 A LACE UP IS GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER OF A FIT SO A LITTLE BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE PERFORMANCE WHERE A VELCRO IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE MORE LOOSER FIT AND MAYBE NOT AS AGGRESSIVE
Gb2otmCS8Dc_8 0 THE TIGHTER THE SHOE THE BETTER OFF IT WORKS
Gb2otmCS8Dc_9 0 THE LESS MOVEMENT YOU HAVE INSIDE THE SHOE THE BETTER IT WORKS
Gb2otmCS8Dc_10 0 ANY TIME THAT YOU ARE BUYING A CLIMBING SHOE YOU CAN BUY THEM AT YOUR LOCAL INDOOR GYM OR OUTDOOR OUTFITTER
Gb2otmCS8Dc_11 0 I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT YOU BUY ROCK CLIMBING SHOES ON LINE SIMPLY FOR THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T TRY THEM ON
Gb2otmCS8Dc_12 0 ALL ROCK CLIMBING SHOES FIT DIFFERENTLY AND ARE DIFFERENT THAN YOUR NORMAL SHOE SIZE
Gb2otmCS8Dc_13 0 THIS HAS BEEN HOW TO BUY A PAIR OF ROCK CLIMBING SHOES
Gp1cev1uppc_1 0 ANOTHER REALLY INTERESTING PLANT IS THIS VERY SMALL SEDUM
Gp1cev1uppc_2 0 NOW IN THE FALL YOU WOULD SEE OFTEN TIMES THE LARGE SEDUM WITH THE VERY BURNT ORANGE TOP WHICH ARE FAIRLY COMMON
Gp1cev1uppc_3 0 NOW THIS LITTLE SEDUM EVEN THOUGH IT IS VERY SMALL IT DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TO IT IT JUST A UNIQUE LOOK IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE FOUNTAIN AS YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THEM THE EDGES JUST KIND OF COME UP KIND OF COME DOWN
Gp1cev1uppc_4 0 THERE WOULD BE A TINY LITTLE FLOWER THAT WOULD PROBABLY APPEAR HERE ABOUT A WEEK OR TWO AS YOU CAN SEE
Gp1cev1uppc_5 0 BUT THE PLANT IS NOT KNOWN FOR IT'S FLOWERS IT IS NOTICE FOR ITS SHAPE AND BECAUSE OF THAT THIS IS THE ONE PLANT YOU DON'T DIVIDE
Gp1cev1uppc_6 0 THIS PLANT I ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO I TRIED DIVIDING A CORNER OF IT TO GIVE IT TO A FRIEND OF MINE AND I KILLED IT MINE NEVER CAME BACK SO MY DEAR FRIEND AS SHE IS THIS YEAR GAVE ME THIS PLANT THAT SHE START
Gp1cev1uppc_7 0 THE WAY THAT SHE STARTED IT AND THE WAY THAT I STARTED IT IS I WOULD TAKE ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUAL ACTUAL SIDES PROBABLY PUT IT IN THE GROUND ALL BY ITSELF OR PUT IT IN WATER AND IT WOULD ACTUALLY ROOT ITSELF THAT WAY
Gp1cev1uppc_8 0 BUT I THINK TRYING TO CUT IT IN HALF YOU DISTURB THE PLANT AND THAT IS WHEN I KILLED MINE SO THESE ARE ONE OF THOSE PLANTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO TREAT WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE OF TENDER LOVING CARE
Gp1cev1uppc_9 0 IT LOOKS GREAT WITH CERTAIN COLORS THIS VERY MILD ORANGE MAKES IT LOOK NICE HERE PUT A LITTLE ROCK BY IT A LITTLE PURPLE TIME AND YOU HAVE A NICE LITTLE SECTION OF YOUR GARDEN
Gqtv9w1mypI_1 0 ALRIGHT SO THE NEXT FREESTYLE TRICK YOU WANT TO LEARN IS CALLED THE 180
Gqtv9w1mypI_2 0 BASICALLY WHAT YOU DO IS YOUR FULL BODY MAKES A ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREE ROTATION
Gqtv9w1mypI_3 0 YOU FACE FROM EITHER ONE WAY TO THE OTHER WAY
Gqtv9w1mypI_4 0 WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS IT'S ALL ABOUT FLEXING EXTENSION OF OUR KNEES AND BY THAT I MEAN WE USE OUR KNEES LIKE OUR KNEES ARE A JOINT
Gqtv9w1mypI_5 0 WE JUST BEND THEM LIKE THIS
Gqtv9w1mypI_6 0 IT S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THAT KNEE BEND OUT OF THESE 180S
Gqtv9w1mypI_7 0 THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO GET THE HEIGHT YOU WANT AND THE SPIN YOU WANT
Gqtv9w1mypI_8 0 SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS IF THE MOUNTAIN IS GOING THIS WAY WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS GET REALLY LOW WITH THAT FLEXION OF OUR KNEES AND WE'RE GOING TO START WITH COMMITTING OUR SHOULDERS
Gqtv9w1mypI_9 0 SHOULDERS IS A HUNDRED PERCENT COMMITMENT ON THIS 180 OR 360 OR 540 HOWEVER MANY SPINS YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF IT
Gqtv9w1mypI_10 0 YOUR SHOULDERS ARE WHAT IS GOING TO HELP YOU DRIVE THIS TRICK
Gqtv9w1mypI_11 0 SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS START FLEXING YOUR KNEES AND START OPENING UP YOUR SHOULDERS WHICHEVER WAY YOU WANT TO TURN
Gqtv9w1mypI_12 0 IF I'M REGULING AND I'M GOING THIS WAY I START OPENING UP AND FACING MY NOSE I'M GOING TO DO A FRONT-SIDE 180
Gqtv9w1mypI_13 0 SO WHAT WE DO ON THIS FRONT-SIDE 180 WE BEND DOWN START OPENING OUR SHOULDERS AND ONCE WE CAN SEE OUR BOARD OUR TIP OF OUR NOSE YOU WANT TO RELEASE WITH YOUR LEGS AND START TURNING YOUR SHOULDER
Gqtv9w1mypI_14 0 ONE THING YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU KIND OF WANT TO LOOK OVER YOUR LEFT SHOULDER
Gqtv9w1mypI_15 0 IF YOU'RE REGULAR FOOTED OR IF YOU RE GOOFY FOOTED
Gqtv9w1mypI_16 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO I'M GOING TO GO REALLY LOW START OPENING MY SHOULDERS AND ONCE I GET BACK HERE I'M GOING TO RELEASEAND IT S JUST GOING TO PHYSICALLY SPIN ME TO WHERE I'M FACING THAT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREE TURN
Gqtv9w1mypI_17 0 LIKE I SAID ONCE YOU GET THESE 180S YOU CAN PROGRESS ON THE 360S WHICH IS TWO FULL SPINS FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY 540 WHICH IS ONE AND A HALF FULL SPINS SO ON AND SO FORTH AND THEN BASICALLY THIS 180 IS A STEPPING BLOCK TO EVERY OTHER SPIN
gGDtCt2CVmo_1 0 LET'S PUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES ON THE COVER
gGDtCt2CVmo_2 0 SO AFTER YOU'VE FOLDED THE SHEETS IN BE SURE TO MAKE THAT LITTLE CLIP WHERE THAT FOLD IS AGAIN YOU KNOW REINFORCE IF THAT CAN STILL MOVE
gGDtCt2CVmo_3 0 WE'RE GOING TO FOLD THAT IN
gGDtCt2CVmo_4 0 FLIP THIS OVER AND TAKE YOUR RULER AND JUST SMOOTH OUT ANY OF THOSE BUBBLES THAT MAY HAVE WORKED THEY WAY INTO THE COVER
gGDtCt2CVmo_5 0 IF YOU DO FIND THAT THERE'S A BUBBLE IN THE CONTACT SHEET YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE A PIN OR YOUR OAL JUST MAKE A LITTLE NICK IN THERE AND IT'S GOING TO OPEN IT UP SO THE AIR CAN BE PUSHED OUT
gGDtCt2CVmo_6 0 THAT WAY YOU GET A REALLY CLEAN NICE COVER
gGDtCt2CVmo_7 0 NOW WE'RE GOING TO NEED OUR CRAFT GLUE AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT THIS INSIDE SHEET ON TO THE COVER INSIDE PART OF THE COVER
gGDtCt2CVmo_8 0 SO OPEN THAT UP
gGDtCt2CVmo_9 0 MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN A WELL VENTILATED ROOM AND WE'RE GOING TO SMOOTH THIS ON TO THE BACK
gGDtCt2CVmo_10 0 GET A REALLY EVEN CLEAN COAT ON THERE ALL THE WAY DOWN
gGDtCt2CVmo_11 0 GET RIGHT TO THE EDGE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOUR PAPERS GOING TO COME OKAY AND THEN GET THIS TOP PART AS WELL AND SET THIS ON THERE AND GET IT NICE AND EVEN
gGDtCt2CVmo_12 0 MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF ROOM ALL AROUND
gGDtCt2CVmo_13 0 IT LOOKS LIKE ON ONE PART YOU'VE GOTTEN A LITTLE TOO MUCH JUST TAKE YOUR SCISSORS AND TRIM IT OFF A LITTLE BIT
gGDtCt2CVmo_14 0 SMOOTH THAT TOWARDS THE FLAP
gGDtCt2CVmo_15 0 SOON AS IT FEELS LIKE IT'S GOING TO STICK YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS FLAP AND BEND IT BACKWARDS AND PUT YOUR NAIL IN THERE AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO IS GET THIS PAPER TO GO RIGHT INSIDE THAT GROOVE
gGDtCt2CVmo_16 0 YOU WANT IT TO STAY IN THERE
gGDtCt2CVmo_17 0 SO WHEN YOU BEND IT UP YOU SHOULD HAVE IT FOLDED INSIDE THAT CREASE
gGDtCt2CVmo_18 0 SO WE'LL GET THAT
gGDtCt2CVmo_19 0 THERE WE GO
gGDtCt2CVmo_20 0 HERE WE GO
gGDtCt2CVmo_21 0 SO IT SHOULD BEND INSIDE THE CREASE AND THEN WHEN YOU GET THAT FIND YOUR HOLES THAT YOU MADE INSIDE AND JUST POKE YOUR OAL OR RE-HOLE PUNCH THAT SO YOU KNOW WHERE TO PUT YOUR SCREWS AGAIN AND AS SOON AS WE GET THAT DONE THEN WE ARE READY TO GO

gGDtCt2CVmo_26 0 NOW WE'RE READY TO PREPARE THE PAPER
h35T7XMLKrY_1 0 IN THIS VIDEO I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT CLAW CATCHES
h35T7XMLKrY_2 0 NOW THIS IS A MEDIUM TO EASY BALL JUGGLING PATTERN WHEN YOU DO IT WITH THREE
h35T7XMLKrY_3 0 ALL YOU'RE DOING INSTEAD OF CATCHING AND THROWING LIKE THIS YOU'RE GOING TO TURN YOUR HAND OVER AND GRAB THE BALL FROM THE TOP
h35T7XMLKrY_4 0 CLAW IT LIKE THAT AND THROW LIKE THIS
h35T7XMLKrY_5 0 SO IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO GET USED TO THROWING UPSIDE DOWN THIS THROW AND GETTING THAT CLEAN
h35T7XMLKrY_6 0 BUT JUST WORK ON THAT WITH BOTH HANDS AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE ADD IT INTO YOUR THREE BALL PATTERN
h35T7XMLKrY_7 0 JUST SOMETHING LIKE THAT
h35T7XMLKrY_8 0 NOW WORK ON IT WITH BOTH HANDS
h35T7XMLKrY_9 0 YOU CAN ADD IT WITH ONE HAND SOLID THEN THE OTHER AND WHAT YOU'RE REALLY WORKING UP TO IS SOLID CLAW CATCHES SOMETHING LIKE THIS
h35T7XMLKrY_10 0 NOW IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF PRACTICE TO GET THIS CLEAN
h35T7XMLKrY_11 0 YOU JUST WORK UP TO IT LIKE THAT
h35T7XMLKrY_12 0 WORK ON THE SWITCH
h35T7XMLKrY_13 0 ALL YOU'RE DOING IS TURNING YOUR WRIST OVER LIKE THAT BACK AND FORTH AND THEN YOU JUST HAVE TO GET YOUR FINGERS TO CONTROL THE THROW CORRECTLY
h35T7XMLKrY_14 0 SO AGAIN THESE ARE CLAW CATCHES
h35T7XMLKrY_15 0 IT'S A PRETTY GOOD VISUAL TRICK PEOPLE CAN REALLY SEE THE DIFFERENCE AND MAYBE YOU CAN ADD SOME GROWLING IN THERE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT MAKE PEOPLE REALLY LIKE THE TRICK
G4CzvKfH9AE_1 0 NOW THE OPPOSITE OF A HAMMER ON IS A PULL OFF
G4CzvKfH9AE_2 0 IN THE LAST CLIP WE NOTED THAT A HAMMER ON MEANT YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY A NOTE AND DRIVE YOUR FINGER OF YOUR FRETTING HAND INTO THE FRET BOARD AND THE FORCE OF YOUR FINGER AND THE STRING MAKING CONTRACT WITH THE FRET WILL ALLOW THAT NEXT NOTE THE SECOND NOTE TO RING OUT
G4CzvKfH9AE_3 0 RATHER THAN PICKING THE NOTE TWICE WE'D HAVE NOW A PULL OFF IS JUST THE OPPOSITE
G4CzvKfH9AE_4 0 WHERE GOING TO START WITH A NOTE AND RATHER THAN PICKING THE SECOND NOTE WE'RE GOING TO PICK THE FIRST NOTE AND PULL THE FINGER OFF OF THE STRING DOWN AND AWAY FROM THE STRING
G4CzvKfH9AE_5 0 SO THAT INSTEAD OF PICKING WITH THE RIGHT HAND ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE JUST GRIPPING THE STRING WITH YOUR FRETTED FINGER AND PULLING IT BACK ALLOWING THAT STRING TO RING OUT
G4CzvKfH9AE_6 0 NOW AGAIN YOU COULD DO THAT TO AN OPEN STRING OR YOU CAN KEEP A FINGER FRETTED AND PLAY A NOTE THAT'LL PULL OFF TO THAT NOTE
GdSH7P6cZEc_1 0 THE NEXT TECHNIQUE WE'RE GOING TO DO IS ADDING HAIR
GdSH7P6cZEc_2 0 SO FIRST WE'LL DO ADDING HAIR TO A BASIC THREE STRAND BRAID
GdSH7P6cZEc_3 0 SO I'LL DO ANOTHER LITTLE PARTING LIKE THIS
GdSH7P6cZEc_4 0 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KEEP THE HAIR CLIPPED AWAY FROM THE SECTION THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON SO THAT YOU DON'T GET HAIR CAUGHT UP IN THE SECTION THAT YOU ARE WORKING ON
GdSH7P6cZEc_5 0 FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO ADD A PIECE OF HAIR
GdSH7P6cZEc_6 0 SO IT'S STILL THE SAME TECHNIQUE
GdSH7P6cZEc_7 0 YOU STILL START WITH THE THREE PIECES
GdSH7P6cZEc_8 0 BUT FIRST WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS WRAP THE HAIR AROUND PUSHING IT AS CLOSE TO THE BASE HOLDING IT AS CLOSE TO THE BASE AS POSSIBLE
GdSH7P6cZEc_9 0 YOU WANT TO HOLD THEIR HAIR BETWEEN YOUR FOREFINGER AND YOUR THUMB
GdSH7P6cZEc_10 0 THEN YOU WANT TO SECTION THE HAIR THAT YOU ADD
GdSH7P6cZEc_11 0 YOU WANT TO ADD A SMALL PIECE INTO THEIR HAIR SO THAT YOU HAVE YOUR THREE STRANDS JUST LIKE YOUR REGULAR THREE STRAND BRAID
GdSH7P6cZEc_12 0 THEN YOU WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THE SAME TECHNIQUE
GdSH7P6cZEc_13 0 TAKE THE LEFT SIDE BRING IT TO THE MIDDLE
GdSH7P6cZEc_14 0 BRING THE MIDDLE TO THE LEFT
GdSH7P6cZEc_15 0 AND THERE YOU GO
GdSH7P6cZEc_16 0 YOU WANT TO TAKE THE RIGHT SIDE BRING IT TO THE MIDDLE
GdSH7P6cZEc_17 0 MIDDLE TO THE RIGHT
GdSH7P6cZEc_18 0 SAME EXACT TECHNIQUE BUT YOU'RE HOLDING THE HAIR AS CLOSE TO THE SCALP AS POSSIBLE SO THAT THE SYNTHETIC HAIR THAT YOU'VE ADDED DOES NOT SLIDE
GdSH7P6cZEc_19 0 SMOOTHING ALL THAT HAIR SO YOU CAN MAKE IT ALL BLEND
GdSH7P6cZEc_20 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE WHEN ADDING HAIR THAT YOU WRAP THAT HAIR TIGHTLY AROUND YOUR FINGER SO THAT IT STAYS FLAT
GdSH7P6cZEc_21 0 USING YOUR FINGER UNDERNEATH AS A BASE SO THAT THE BRAID DOESN'T MOVE AND STAYS FLAT
GdSH7P6cZEc_22 0 THE FINGER UNDER THE BRAID IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS TECHNIQUE BECAUSE IT HELPS TO KEEP THE BRAID CONSISTENT
GdSH7P6cZEc_23 0 AND IT GIVES IT A GOOD BASE AND FOUNDATION WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT
GdSH7P6cZEc_24 0 AND IT ALSO CONTROLS THE TIGHTNESS OF THE BRAID
GdSH7P6cZEc_25 0 SO ME STICKING MY FINGER HERE AND WRAPPING THIS BEHIND IT AND AROUND MY FINGER TIGHTLY IS MAKING THE BRAID ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO BE TIGHT
GdSH7P6cZEc_26 0 BECAUSE IF I DIDN'T DO THAT I COULD JUST DO THIS AND JUST GRAB THE STRANDS LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE DO
GdSH7P6cZEc_27 0 BUT LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE BRAID
GdSH7P6cZEc_28 0 IT GIVES YOU A MUCH LOOSER BRAID WHICH SOMETIMES IS GOOD IF YOU WANT LOSE BRAIDS
GdSH7P6cZEc_29 0 BUT LOOK AT ALL THE EXCESS HAIR THAT IT LEAVES OUT WHEN YOU'RE NOT WRAPPING AND YOU'RE JUST BRAIDING
GdSH7P6cZEc_30 0 ESPECIALLY WHEN HAIR IS ADDED
GdSH7P6cZEc_31 0 SO YOU WANT TO WRAP WRAP WRAP WRAP ALMOST AS IF YOU'RE PUSHING IT UP AND BEHIND YOUR FINGER
GdSH7P6cZEc_32 0 IT GIVES YOU A MUCH TIGHTER BRAID
GdSH7P6cZEc_33 0 BUT SOMETIMES YOU JUST WANT A LOSE BRAID AND YOU JUST DO THE SAME TECHNIQUE
GdSH7P6cZEc_34 0 YOU JUST DON'T WRAP AS TIGHT
GdSH7P6cZEc_35 0 AND THIS IS HOW YOU DO EXTENSIONS
GdSH7P6cZEc_36 0 YOU EXTEND THE HAIR BY ADDING IN JUST BRAIDING IT IN
GdSH7P6cZEc_37 0 AND THERE YOU ARE
Hg9e8ySvdr0_1 0 HI THIS IS MIKE LOPEZ WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
Hg9e8ySvdr0_2 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING MAGIC THE GATHERING THE CARD GAME

Hg9e8ySvdr0_13 0 AND WHEN YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE MANA USUALLY PEOPLE STACK THE MANA TO SAVE SPACE ON THE GAMING TABLE
Hg9e8ySvdr0_14 0 WHEN YOU PLAY A CARD AND YOU DIRECT IT TO A CREATURE CARD OR ANYTHING ON THE TABLE
Hg9e8ySvdr0_15 0 YOU PLACE IT ON THE TABLE TO SIGNIFY THAT THAT'S WHAT IT IS BEING USED ON OR IF SOMETHING IS ENCHANTING SOMETHING YOU WOULD TAKE IT AND YOU WOULD PLACE IT BEHIND
Hg9e8ySvdr0_16 0 THAT WAY EVERYONE KNOWS THAT IT IS ENCHANTED

gqkc-eW6Qo4_1 0 HI MY NAME'S AMY KISTLER AND I'M A PERSONAL TRAINER
gqkc-eW6Qo4_2 0 I'VE HAD THREE YEARS EXPERIENCE AND I'M CERTIFIED BY ACE WHICH IS THE AMERICAN COUNCIL ON EXERCISE
gqkc-eW6Qo4_3 0 I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU GUYS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT A PERSONAL TRAINER DOES
gqkc-eW6Qo4_4 0 A PERSONAL TRAINER IS SOMEBODY WHO WORKS ONE ON ONE WITH PEOPLE
gqkc-eW6Qo4_5 0 THEY ALSO CAN WORK IN GROUPS
gqkc-eW6Qo4_6 0 SO THEY'RE LEADERS THEY'RE GUIDERS THEY KNOW A LOT ABOUT HEALTH THEY KNOW A LOT ABOUT EXERCISE
gqkc-eW6Qo4_7 0 MOST PERSONAL TRAINERS HAVE A BACKGROUND IN KINESIOLOGY OR EXERCISE SCIENCE
gqkc-eW6Qo4_8 0 THEY ARE VERY WELL ROUNDED PEOPLE AND THEY'RE ROLL MODELS
gqkc-eW6Qo4_9 0 WHEN PERSONAL TRAINERS ARE SETTING UP AN EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR ONE PERSON OR MULTIPLE PEOPLE THEY MAKE SURE THAT THEIR PROGRAMS ARE INDIVIDUALIZED
gqkc-eW6Qo4_10 0 SO THEY SIT THEM DOWN AND THEY NORMALLY HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH THEM WHERE THEY BASICALLY ASK THE PERSON WHAT THEY WANT THEIR GOALS TO BE THEIR HEALTH THEIR PAST HISTORY WITH EXERCISE SO THAT THEY MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM THAT THEY SET UP FOR THEM IS GOING TO HELP THEM BE SUCCESSFUL AND THEY'RE GOING TO HIT THEIR GOAL
gqkc-eW6Qo4_11 0 PERSONAL TRAINERS WORK IN ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF ATMOSPHERES
gqkc-eW6Qo4_12 0 YOU HAVE PERSONAL TRAINERS THAT ARE AT HOME PERSONAL TRAINERS
gqkc-eW6Qo4_13 0 AN AT HOME PERSONAL TRAINER IS SOMEBODY WHO GOES TO THE HOME OF A CLIENT AND IF A PERSONAL TRAINER DOES THIS THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE INSURED
gqkc-eW6Qo4_14 0 WE ALSO HAVE PERSONAL TRAINERS WHO WORK AT GYMS
gqkc-eW6Qo4_15 0 THIS IS THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF PERSONAL TRAINER
gqkc-eW6Qo4_16 0 THEY MAINLY WORK ONE ON ONE WITH CLIENTS
gqkc-eW6Qo4_17 0 EVERY ONCE AND A WHILE THEY HAVE A GROUP AND IN A GROUP ATMOSPHERE IT'S MAINLY A LOT OF CLIENTELE THAT GET TOGETHER AND THEY WORK OUT A PROGRAM BUT IT STILL IS INDIVIDUALIZED
gqkc-eW6Qo4_18 0 BUT THEY DON'T GET AS MUCH ONE ON ONE ATTENTION AS A PERSONAL TRAINER WITH A ONE ON ONE CLIENT
gqkc-eW6Qo4_19 0 PERSONAL TRAINERS NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THE CORRECT AND SAFE WAY TO USE MACHINES AS WELL AS FREE WEIGHTS AND CARDIOVASCULAR PIECES OF EQUIPMENT
gqkc-eW6Qo4_20 0 THEY NEED TO NOT ONLY KNOW HOW TO DEMONSTRATE THEM THEY NEED TO KNOW HOW TO USE THEM PROPERLY
gqkc-eW6Qo4_21 0 IN MOST GYMS PERSONAL TRAINERS SHOULD UNDERSTAND WHAT TYPE OF EQUIPMENT THEY'RE USING AND HOW THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE WAY IS TO USE IT
gqkc-eW6Qo4_22 0 WHEN THEY'RE DEMONSTRATING THE RIGHT WAY HOW TO DO AN EXERCISE THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY MAKE IT CLEAR WITH THEIR CLIENT THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING BEFORE THE CLIENT GOES OUT THERE AND PERFORMS THE EXERCISE
gqkc-eW6Qo4_23 0 AN INEFFECTIVE METHOD EXAMPLE FOR A TRAINER WOULD BE TO DO THE EXERCISE WITH THEM
gqkc-eW6Qo4_24 0 A PERSONAL TRAINER SHOULD NEVER BE DOING AN EXERCISE WITH THE CLIENT
gqkc-eW6Qo4_25 0 THEY SHOULD BE OBSERVING THE CLIENT SO THE CLIENT IS DOING IT THE PROPER WAY SO THEY DON'T INJURE THEMSELVES

grc068BynJo_8 0 ARMS OUT AWAY FROM THE BODY
grc068BynJo_9 0 NOW REMEMBER WE'RE TRYING NOT TO USE THE SHOULDERS TOO MUCH BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A CAMEL AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO A NICE CLEAN UNDULATION

HcGhpdOiiMI_1 0 HI MY NAME IS BRANDON SARKIS ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
HcGhpdOiiMI_2 0 TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A BRAIDED WREATH OF BREAD
HcGhpdOiiMI_3 0 OK SO IT'S BEEN ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO AN HOUR SO WE'LL PULL IT BACK AND WE'LL SEE THAT WE'VE PROOFED UP RATHER NICELY
HcGhpdOiiMI_4 0 A COUPLE PARTS HERE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW WHERE YOU PINCHED IT THAT IT STAYED PINCHED TOGETHER
HcGhpdOiiMI_5 0 IT DID SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR SOLE REMAINING EGG AND WE'RE GOING TO CRACK IT INTO THAT
HcGhpdOiiMI_6 0 I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE MY BRUSH HERE AND BREAK IT UP
HcGhpdOiiMI_7 0 WE'RE JUST GOING TO BRUSH THE OUTSIDE OF THIS WITH WHOLE EGG
HcGhpdOiiMI_8 0 WHAT THIS IS GOING TO DO IS IT'S GOING TO MAKE THE OUTSIDE NICE AND SHINY AND GIVE IT SOME EXTRA COLOR BEFORE YOU THROW IT INTO THE OVEN
HcGhpdOiiMI_9 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR OVEN'S ON AT 350 DEGREES
HcGhpdOiiMI_10 0 THAT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT I GUESS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BAKE ANYTHING UNLESS THE OVEN'S ON
HcGhpdOiiMI_11 0 WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE OUR EGG HERE AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE TIME TO REALLY BRUSH EVERY SINGLE PART
HcGhpdOiiMI_12 0 DON'T BE SLOPPY THERE'S NOT RUSH
HcGhpdOiiMI_13 0 THE GOOD THING ABOUT THE EGGS IS IF YOU MAKE SURE YOU BRUSH IT ON THE SEAMS IT WILL MAKE SURE YOUR BREAD STICKS TOGETHER AND DOESN'T START ISOLATING ITSELF AT THE SEAMS WHERE IT STARTS TO ALMOST PULL APART
HcGhpdOiiMI_14 0 THE IDEA IS WITH THE FINISHED PRODUCT BECAUSE YOU WANT A BREAD THAT IS ABLE TO BE PULLED APART BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT TO COOK THAT WAY
HcGhpdOiiMI_15 0 YOU DON'T WANT IT TO COOK WHERE PIECES WILL START TO COOK AWAY FROM EACH OTHER
HcGhpdOiiMI_16 0 THAT WOULD BE BAD
HcGhpdOiiMI_17 0 YOU GET ALL SORTS OF WEIRD ISSUES IF THAT STARTS TO HAPPEN
HcGhpdOiiMI_18 0 THAT IS GOOD SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS AND WE'RE GOING TO TOSS IT IN OUR OVEN
HcGhpdOiiMI_19 0 AT THIS POINT IF YOU WANT TO SPRINKLE ANY SORT OF SEEDS OR ANYTHING ON THE OUTSIDE THIS IS THE TIME TO DO IT
HcGhpdOiiMI_20 0 WE'RE GOING TO GET READY TO PUT THIS IN THE OVEN
HcGhpdOiiMI_21 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF SALT AND SALT THE OUTSIDE OF IT
HcGhpdOiiMI_22 0 THIS IS ALL OPTIONAL STUFF HERE AND BECAUSE I LIKE BLACK PEPPER A LOT I'M GOING TO PEPPER THE OUTSIDE OF IT TOO
HcGhpdOiiMI_23 0 IF YOU HAVE ANY SEEDS OR ANYTHING THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR THAT AS WELL
HcGhpdOiiMI_24 0 SO INTO THE OVEN NOW FOR ABOUT SO INTO THE OVEN NOW FOR ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES AT 350 DEGREES AND WE WILL COME BACK WHEN IT'S ALL READY AND SHOW YOU WHAT THE END RESULT LOOKS LIKE
-gbymsI1UGc_1 0 SINCE YOU HAVE WORKED IN THE LOCAL TV STATIONS YOU HAVE WORKED IN TOP TEN MARKETS YOU HAVE WORKED SEVERAL YEARS WITHIN THE BUSINESS YOU FEEL VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOUR WORK EXPERIENCE IT'S TIME TO TAKE THE NEXT BIG STEP
-gbymsI1UGc_2 0 IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE ENOUGH FINANCES TO LAST UNTIL YOU GET YOUR FIRST BIG ASSIGNMENT
-gbymsI1UGc_3 0 DECIDE WHERE YOU WANT TO GO AND WHERE THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES MAYBE SUCH AS RIGHT NOW IT'S THE IRAQ WAR
-gbymsI1UGc_4 0 THERE ARE LOTS OF FREELANCERS WORKING IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN
-gbymsI1UGc_5 0 THERE IS MANY JOBS AVAILABLE
-gbymsI1UGc_6 0 MOST OF THOSE JOBS ARE BEING FILLED OUT OF LONDON
-gbymsI1UGc_7 0 ALL THE MAJOR NEWS NETWORKS HAVE AGENCIES AND BUREAUS IN LONDON
-gbymsI1UGc_8 0 BE PREPARED TO WAIT IT OUT UNTIL YOU GET YOUR FIRST BIG BREAK
-gbymsI1UGc_9 0 THIS COULD BE SEVERAL WEEKS
-gbymsI1UGc_10 0 IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE A GOOD DEMO TAPE OF YOUR PAST WORK SO THEY CAN TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR WORK TO SEE THAT YOU'RE QUALIFIED
-gbymsI1UGc_11 0 YOU NEED TO HAVE A GOOD LIST OF ALL THE EQUIPMENT THAT YOU HAVE WITH YOU AND POSSIBLY A SOUND MAN THAT WOULD BE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU
GmlXpAxcWmQ_1 0 THERE ARE A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW WHEN USING AIR DRIED CLAY
GmlXpAxcWmQ_2 0 WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP IT IN A PLASTIC BAG AND KEPT TIGHTLY WITH ALL THE AIR OUT OF THE BAG
GmlXpAxcWmQ_3 0 IT COMES IN A LARGER BLOCK FIVE TO TEN POUNDS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE'RE CUTTING IT THE BEST WAY TO CUT IT IS TO USE ANOTHER PIECE OF WIRE
GmlXpAxcWmQ_4 0 SOMETHING LIKE THIS THIRTY GAUGE WOULD WORK REALLY WELL TO PULL ACROSS AND CUT THE DESIRED SIZE
GmlXpAxcWmQ_5 0 BUT WHEN WE'RE USING THIS CLAY WE ARE GOING TO ADD WATER TO IT AS IT STARTS TO DRY OUT AND AS YOU NOTICE LIKE IT'S STARTING TO CRACK OR NOT MOVE AS EASILY
GmlXpAxcWmQ_6 0 WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE ARE BREAKING IT APART AND USING SMALLER PIECES AT A TIME WHICH ARE BETTER FOR YOUNGER KIDS AND LITTLER HANDS THAT WE'RE TAKING THE EXTRA AND STORING IT BACK IN THE PLASTIC BAG
GmlXpAxcWmQ_7 0 IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT OUR CLAY'S GOING TO DRY OUT OTHERWISE
GmlXpAxcWmQ_8 0 WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE AIR IS OUT OF THAT BAG AND IT'S SEALED UP FIRMLY BEFORE WE COME BACK TO IT
GmlXpAxcWmQ_9 0 SO WE WANT TO WORK WITH EACH PIECE OF CLAY SMALL AMOUNTS AT A TIME TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T DRY OUT
GxkICAM1cqg_2 0 MY NAME IS ALLEN FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
GxkICAM1cqg_3 0 AND TODAY I'M GOING TO DISCUSS A CONTROVERSIAL AND BANNED ALCOHOL COMMONLY KNOWN AS ABSINTHE
GxkICAM1cqg_4 0 SO WHEN YOU THINK ABSINTHE THE NUMBER ONE INGREDIENT THAT EVERYONE THINKS OF OR THE NUMBER ONE EFFECT REALLY THAT EVERYONE THINKS OF IS THE HALLUCINATION THAT EVERYBODY REALLY PUTS TOGETHER WITH ABSINTHE OR EVERYBODY HEARS ABOUT
GxkICAM1cqg_5 0 WELL THAT INGREDIENT IS WORMWOOD AND THAT'S REALLY THE REASON WHY IT HAS BEEN BANNED HERE IN THE UNITES STATES AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES BUT A LOT OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE BRINGING IT BACK
GxkICAM1cqg_6 0 BECAUSE THEY'RE FINDING LESS EFFECTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT OR TAKING DIFFERENT PROCESSES TO BREW IT WITHOUT THE TOXINS OR NEURAL TOXINS THAT COME FROM WORMWOOD THAT REALLY GIVE THESE HALLUCINOGENIC EFFECTS OR SIDE EFFECTS TO THE DRINK
GxkICAM1cqg_7 0 NOW IF YOU GO ON THE FDA'S WEBSITE WHO ORIGINALLY BANNED THE ABSINTHE PRODUCT CONTAINING WORMWOOD YOU'LL SEE THE POSSIBLE HEALTH HAZARDS
GxkICAM1cqg_8 0 IT SAYS NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS CHARACTERIZED BY NUMBNESS OF LEGS AND ARMS LOSS OF INTELLECT DELIRIUM AND PARALYSIS
GxkICAM1cqg_9 0 NOW THIS IS PROBABLY IF YOU CONSUME TONS AND TONS OF THIS DRINK
GxkICAM1cqg_10 0 AND CONSUMED ON A VERY MINUTE OR VERY MINIMAL LEVEL AND A CONTROLLED LEVEL IT'S REALLY NOT GOING TO HAVE TOO MUCH OF AN EFFECT ON YOU
GxkICAM1cqg_11 0 SOMETIMES YES YOU'LL DEFINITELY FEEL A LITTLE BIT OF A DELIRIUM EFFECT WHICH I HAVE ENCOUNTERED A FEW TIMES DRINKING THIS BUT YOU KNOW REALLY JUST BE SAFE ABOUT IT
GxkICAM1cqg_12 0 NOW WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK INTO WORMWOOD WHY IT DOES THIS WELL IT CONTAINS I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED THUJONE I'M NOT REALLY SURE IF THAT'S THE CORRECT PRONUNCIATION BUT IT'S A CHEMICAL VERY CLOSE TO WHAT'S IN MARIJUANA KNOWN AS THC
GxkICAM1cqg_13 0 AND SINCE THAT THE FDA HAS PLACED THE WORMWOOD HERB IN THE UNSAFE CATEGORY
GxkICAM1cqg_14 0 IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT THIS CHEMICAL IN THE WORMWOOD MAY CAUSE THE NERVE DAMAGE AND OTHER SIDE EFFECTS
GxkICAM1cqg_15 0 SO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DRINK IT OR USE WORMWOOD PRODUCTS WHICH ARE READILY EASY TO FIND MAYBE CONSULT WITH A MEDICAL PHYSICIAN FIRST
GxkICAM1cqg_16 0 BUT REALLY IF YOU DO IT ON A BASIS OR IF YOU CONSUME IT ON A SMART LEVEL YOU'RE NOT REALLY GOING TO RUN INTO ANY POTENTIAL PROBLEMS
GeQZoFEa-aM_1 0 THE MARINE ORGANISM WE ARE GOING TO IDENTIFY NOW IS THE LONGFIN DAMSELFISH
GeQZoFEa-aM_2 0 ONE OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE FISH ON THE CORAL REEF IS THE DAMSELFISH
GeQZoFEa-aM_3 0 THE LONGFIN DAMSELFISH IS ONE OF THE LESS COMMON DAMSELFISH SPECIES
GeQZoFEa-aM_4 0 A RELATIVELY LARGE DAMSELFISH USUALLY THREE TO FOUR INCHES LONG ALTHOUGH THEY CAN REACH A MAXIMUM SIZE OF FIVE INCHES
GeQZoFEa-aM_5 0 THE LONGFIN DAMSELFISH WILL DEFEND ITS TERRITORY VERY AGGRESSIVELY
GeQZoFEa-aM_6 0 THEIR TERRITORY GENERALLY ONLY COVERS A SMALL AREA FOR EXAMPLE A SMALL CORAL HEAD IN THE SAND BUT THEY WILL ATTACK ANYTHING THAT GETS TOO CLOSE TO IT INCLUDING FISH MUCH LARGER THAN ITSELF
GeQZoFEa-aM_7 0 LONGFIN DAMSELFISH ARE SOMEWHAT CHALLENGING TO IDENTIFY SINCE THEY CAN BE EASILY CONFUSED WITH THE DUSKY DAMSELFISH
GeQZoFEa-aM_8 0 WHAT DISTINGUISHES THE TWO SPECIES ARE THE SHAPE AND LENGTH OF THEIR DORSAL AND ANAL FINS
GeQZoFEa-aM_9 0 LONGFIN DAMSELFISH HAVE DORSAL AND ANAL FINS THAT EXTEND WELL BEYOND THE BASE OF THE TAIL AND USUALLY ARE MORE POINTED THAN ROUNDED
GeQZoFEa-aM_10 0 WHERE AS THE DUSKY DAMSELFISH FINS AND JUST ADD OR JUST PASSED THE BASE OF THE TAIL AND ARE ROUNDED
GeQZoFEa-aM_11 0 THE COLORIZATION OF THE LONGFIN DAMSELFISH IS A DARK BROWN TO BLACK OVER ITS ENTIRE BODY AND FINS
GeQZoFEa-aM_12 0 ALTHOUGH THE PECTORAL FINS MAY APPEARED TO BE CLEAR
GeQZoFEa-aM_13 0 JUVENILE LONGFIN DAMSELFISH ARE VERY DIFFERENT LOOKING
GeQZoFEa-aM_14 0 THEY HAVE BRIGHT YELLOW BODIES WITH BRIGHT LITTLE LINES THAT START AT THE NOSE AND RUN ALONG THE BACK OFTEN BREAKING INTO SPOTS INSTEAD OF A CONTINUOUS LINE
GeQZoFEa-aM_15 0 THEY ARE DISTINGUISHED FROM THEIR OTHER SIMILARLY COLORED DAMSELFISH JUVENILES BY A DARK SPOT RINGED IN BLUE ON THEIR DORSAL FIN
GeQZoFEa-aM_16 0 LONGFIN DAMSELFISH CAN BE FOUND THROUGHOUT THE CARIBBEAN AND THE FLORIDA KEYS
GeQZoFEa-aM_17 0 BUT ARE LESS COMMON THAN OTHER SPECIES OF DAMSELFISH SUCH AS THE BICOLOR DAMSELFISH
GeQZoFEa-aM_18 0 THEY CAN BE FOUND IN DEPTHS RANGING FROM A FEW FEET TO DEPTHS WELL BEYOND SAFE DIVING LIMITS FOR RECREATIONAL SCUBA DIVERS
GeQZoFEa-aM_19 0 ALTHOUGH THEY ARE MOST COMMONLY FOUND IN DEPTHS OF LESS THAN EIGHTY FEET
GeQZoFEa-aM_20 0 THEY HAVE A RELATIVELY SMALL TERRITORY THAT THEY PATROL AND RARELY RISE MORE THAN A FEW INCHES ABOVE THE SAFETY OF THEIR PATCH REEF OR CORAL HEAD
GeQZoFEa-aM_21 0 IF THEY FEEL THREATENED THEY WILL QUICKLY DUCK INTO A HOLE IN THE REEF BUT WILL FAIRLY QUICKLY RE-EMERGED
GeQZoFEa-aM_22 0 LONGFIN DAMSELFISH LIKE ALL DAMSELFISH FEED PRIMARILY ON ALGAE AND THEY TEND TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN PERSONAL ALGAE PATCH IN THEIR TERRITORY
GeQZoFEa-aM_23 0 LONGFIN DAMSELFISH ALSO REPORTEDLY FEED ON VARIOUS WORMS HYDROIDS ZOO PLANKTON AND TUNICATES
GeQZoFEa-aM_24 0 LONGFIN DAMSELFISH EXISTS AS SEPARATE MALE AND FEMALE SPECIMENS
GeQZoFEa-aM_25 0 ALTHOUGH THE COLOR AND PATTERNS DO NOT DIFFER
GeQZoFEa-aM_26 0 EGGS ARE LAID BY THE FEMALE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE REEF AND THEN THE MALE SWIMS OVER THEM TO FERTILIZE THEM
GeQZoFEa-aM_27 0 ONCE FERTILIZED THE MALE LONGFIN DAMSELFISH GUARDS THE EGGS UNTIL THEY HATCH AND WILL BE MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN NORMAL IN PROTECTING THE AREA AROUND THE EGGS
GeQZoFEa-aM_28 0 ONCE HATCHED THE FRIAR ARE ON THEIR OWN
GeQZoFEa-aM_29 0 THAT'S THE LONGFIN DAMSELFISH
H2OE97e7fw8_1 0 OK MY NAME IS CRISTY NIX WITH STONE BLESSINGS AND I'VE BEEN ASKED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO ZONE OUT
H2OE97e7fw8_2 0 ZONING OUT IS ACTUALLY WHEN YOUR CONSCIOUS MIND SEEMS TO RELAX AND ALLOW YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND TO COME UP
H2OE97e7fw8_3 0 WHEN YOU'RE IN THE ZONE EVERYTHING SEEMS TO GO LIKE CLOCK WORK
H2OE97e7fw8_4 0 YOU'RE IN YOUR NATURAL RHYTHM YOU GET A PARKING SPACE UP FRONT YOU'RE VERY AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND YOU BUT YOU'RE NOT REALLY INTERACTING WITH IT
H2OE97e7fw8_5 0 YOU'RE IN YOUR OWN LITTLE WORLD SO TO SPEAK AND WHAT THAT IS IS WHEN YOU ACTUALLY ALLOW YOURSELF TO SHIFT AND CONNECT WITH YOUR DIVINE SOURCE YOUR HIGHER SELF AS IT BE
H2OE97e7fw8_6 0 AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF THAT IS INCREDIBLY POSITIVE AND IT'S FOR YOUR HIGHEST GOOD IT'S OF YOUR HIGHEST GOOD
H2OE97e7fw8_7 0 SO ZONING OUT IS ACTUALLY IF YOU CAN PRACTICE IT TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN DO THAT ON CUE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS AND HAVE SOMETHING JUST FLOW FROM THE HEART IT'S AMAZING THE WONDERFUL THINGS THAT CAN COME OUT OF ZONING OUT
gedjAg79VKQ_1 0 JEREMY HERE WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
gedjAg79VKQ_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TALK ABOUT MAYBE SOME OF THE FRUSTRATIONS YOU MIGHT BE HAVING WITH LEARNING THREE CLUBS
gedjAg79VKQ_3 0 NOW THE MOST COMMON THING IS ONE OF TWO THINGS EITHER ONCE AGAIN LIKE THE BALLS YOU'RE THROWING THEM TOO FAR OUT AND YOU HAVE TO RUN AFTER THEM OR WHAT'S EVEN MORE COMMON IS YOU'RE GETTING TOO MUCH OF A SPIN ON IT AND IT'S COMING BACK AND IT'S WHACKING YOU ON THE LIP
gedjAg79VKQ_4 0 WHEN I STARTED LEARNING CLUBS I ACTUALLY HAD A FAT LIP FOR THE FIRST TWO WEEKS UNTIL I FIGURED OUT WHAT TO DO
gedjAg79VKQ_5 0 NOW IF YOU'RE GETTING TOO MUCH SPIN AND IT'S COMING BACK TO YOU ODDS ARE YOU'RE HOLDING IT TOO FAR UP ON THE CLUB
gedjAg79VKQ_6 0 YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET AS CLOSE TO THAT CENTER OF BALANCE AS POSSIBLE WHEN YOU HOLD IT
gedjAg79VKQ_7 0 I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD WITH TWO IT'S MUCH EASIER TO HOLD THEM UP HERE BUT YOU HAVE A LOT LESS CONTROL WHEN YOU'RE AWAY FROM THE CENTER OF BALANCE
gedjAg79VKQ_8 0 NOW IF THAT DOESN'T STOP IT FROM HITTING YOUR LIP THEN THE NEXT THING TO DO IS GO AHEAD AND MOVE BACK TO ONE GO TO TWO GO TO THREE CLUBS
gedjAg79VKQ_9 0 JUST LIKE WITH BALLS IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE HIGHER NUMBERS THEN MOVE BACK TO THE ONE BEFORE AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE IT MASTERED WITH BOTH HANDS DOMINANT AND NON-DOMINANT
gedjAg79VKQ_10 0 IF YOU'RE RUNNING AFTER THE BALLS OR AFTER THE CLUBS MAKE SURE THAT ONCE AGAIN YOU PRACTICE IN FRONT OF A WALL AND THAT SORT OF THING AND THAT USUALLY TAKES CARE OF IT
hJ_DMggaOS4_1 0 JUST ABOUT ANY HORSE THAT'S NOT AFRAID OF A COW CAN BE SOMEWHAT HELPFUL IN LEARNING HOW TO READ AND TRACK COWS
hJ_DMggaOS4_2 0 BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION IN OUR SPORT WE REALLY APPRECIATE WHEN WE CAN COME UPON AND PURCHASE ONE THAT HAS THE GOOD BREEDING AND THE COW SENSE OR IN OTHER WORDS IS VERY COWEE
hJ_DMggaOS4_3 0 WE'RE A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE CUTTING WORLD WHERE IT'S ALL ABOUT STYLE AND BEING JUDGED WHICH WE APPRECIATE AND DO OUR BEST TO ENSURE THAT OUR COW OR CUTTING HORSES MAINTAIN A LOT OF THOSE QUALITIES
hJ_DMggaOS4_4 0 BUT WHAT WE LOOK FOR IS A HORSE THAT'S VERY BOLD AND BRAVE AND NOT GOING TO BE INTIMIDATED BY THE CHALLENGE OF A STRONG COW
hJ_DMggaOS4_5 0 SO OUR COW HORSE STILL NEEDS TO BE THAT QUICK AND TURNING ON THE HIND BUT ALSO IS ALLOWED TO GET A LITTLE MORE AGGRESSIVE A LITTLE BIT FASTER IN ITS EFFORTS TO CONTROL THAT COW
hJ_DMggaOS4_6 0 SO WE'RE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON LEARNING MORE ABOUT HOW WE PUT THIS GOOD COW HORSE TO WORK AGAINST THE TIME CLOCK WHERE THE SIXTY SECOND CLOCK OF OUR TEAM PENNING AND RANCH SORTING SPORT
hJ_DMggaOS4_7 0 YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS HORSE HAS THAT INHERIT QUALITY THAT I SAY KIND OF PRESENTS SIMILAR TO A POLICEMAN WITH TWO LOADED GUNS FEELING TO THAT COW
hJ_DMggaOS4_8 0 ANOTHER HORSE WITHOUT THAT COWEENESS THAT QUICK FOOTED MOVEMENT THAT MATCHES AND MIRRORS THE COW'S MOVEMENT ANOTHER HORSE MIGHT NOT PERFORM QUITE TO THE DETAIL THAT WE NEED IT TO
hJ_DMggaOS4_9 0 SO WE FIRST GO OUT AND TRY TO ACHIEVE THE PURCHASE OF A GOOD COW HORSE KEEP THOSE COW SKILLS ALIVE KEEP WORKING THEM ON THE COWS BUT WE ALSO LET THEM GET JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE IN THEIR EFFORTS TO CHALLENGE THOSE COW MOVES WHEN WE NEED THEM AT THE BRINK OF A SECOND

h0MqVxue_jE_1 0 HI THIS IS RACHAEL RICHARDSON WITH NUTROLUTION IN SOUTH BEACH MIAMI FLORIDA
h0MqVxue_jE_2 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO REDUCE EXCESS GAS
h0MqVxue_jE_3 0 NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT EXCESS GAS COMES FROM EATING CERTAIN FOODS THAT DON'T REACT WELL WITH THEIR BODY AND ACTUALLY THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE HOWEVER THE KEY THAT I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE MISSING IS THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW MUCH GOOD BACTERIA AND HA WE HAVE IN OUR INTESTINES AND HAVING THE RIGHT BALANCE
h0MqVxue_jE_4 0 SO I HATE FOR SOMEBODY TO LET'S SAY CUT OUT AN ENTIRE FOOD GROUP LET'S SAY VEGETABLES BECAUSE THEY HAVE TOO MUCH GAS WHEN THEY REALLY NEED THOSE VEGETABLES
h0MqVxue_jE_5 0 AND THE WAY TO OFFSET THE GAS AND TO PREVENT THE GAS IS WITH GOOD HEALTHY BACTERIA
h0MqVxue_jE_6 0 SO WHENEVER ANYONE COMPLAINS ABOUT GAS IT'S ALWAYS A CLEAR SIGN THAT THEY'VE GOT TOO MUCH BAD BACTERIA IN THEIR SYSTEM AND IT'S TIME TO START CLEARING OUT THAT BACTERIA
h0MqVxue_jE_7 0 THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS BY TAKING PROBIOTICS WHICH ARE THESE
h0MqVxue_jE_8 0 THESE ARE AN EXCELLENT FORM OF PROBIOTICS ALONG WITH AN ANTIMICROBIAL SUPPLEMENT TO HELP KILL SOME OF THE BAD BACTERIA AS WELL AS TAKING A REALLY GOOD FIBER SUPPLEMENT OR EVEN JUST SOME GROUND FLAX SEED TO HELP MOVE THE BACTERIA OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM
h0MqVxue_jE_9 0 AND YOU WILL REDUCE YOUR GAS CONSIDERABLY THIS WAY
h0MqVxue_jE_10 0 THIS IS RACHAEL RICHARDSON AND THIS HAS BEEN HOW TO REDUCE EXCESS GAS

GLIMfjVK8_s_4 0 I'M A PHOTOGRAPHER AND A DIGITAL RETOUCHING ARTIST HERE IN NEW YORK CITY
GLIMfjVK8_s_5 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SCRAPBOOKING WITH PHOTOSHOP CS3
GLIMfjVK8_s_6 0 NOW THERE'S SO MUCH THAT YOU CAN DO WITH PHOTOSHOP
GLIMfjVK8_s_7 0 WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS JUST OPEN UP SOME SOME IMAGES THAT WE CAN WORK WITH
GLIMfjVK8_s_8 0 HERE'S A HERE'S A BACKGROUND TEXTURE THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING
GLIMfjVK8_s_9 0 WE'RE JUST GOING TO CREATE A PAGE FOR A SCRAPBOOK AND LET'S START WITH THE BACKGROUND
GLIMfjVK8_s_10 0 THIS HAPPENS TO BE JUST SOMETHING I DOWNLOADED
GLIMfjVK8_s_11 0 AND THEN MAYBE I WANT TO HAVE A NICE PICTURE OF HOW ABOUT A PICTURE OF MY SWEETHEART AND MYSELF
GLIMfjVK8_s_12 0 NOW WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS TAKE THE RECTANGULAR MARQUEE TOOL AND JUST GRAB A SMALL PORTION OF THAT PICTURE JUST BY GOING CREATING THE MARQUEE AND THEN GOING EDIT COPY AND THEN GO AHEAD AND CLOSE THAT IMAGE AND PASTE IT EDIT PASTE RIGHT INTO OUR BACKGROUND PICTURE
GLIMfjVK8_s_13 0 I MIGHT WANT TO GIVE THAT A LITTLE BIT OF A OH A LITTLE BIT OF A LITTLE BIT OF SHAPE SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND ROTATE IT BY USING THE TRANSFORM/ ROTATE TOOL AND PLACE IT A LITTLE BIT OFF CENTER MAYBE
GLIMfjVK8_s_14 0 THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTING
GLIMfjVK8_s_15 0 HIT ENTER TO SAVE THOSE CHANGES AND LET'S LET'S GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT OF A DROP SHADOW WHY DON'T WE SO GO INTO LAYER LAYER STYLES DROP SHADOW AND IF YOU SLIDE THAT WINDOW OVER YOU CAN GET A PREVIEW OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE
GLIMfjVK8_s_16 0 YOU CAN CHANGE THE ANGLE OF THE LIGHT AND THE DISTANCE OF THE SHADOW FROM THE PICTURE
GLIMfjVK8_s_17 0 THAT LOOKS KIND OF INTERESTING SO LET'S GO WITH THAT
GLIMfjVK8_s_18 0 AND MAYBE WE WANT TO HAVE SOME TEXT IN THERE SO WE SELECT OUR TEXT TOOL AND JUST ENTER SOME TEXT
GLIMfjVK8_s_19 0 AND AS YOU CAN SEE THAT TEXT IS VERY SMALL CAN'T REALLY SEE IT SO WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP OUR CHARACTER DIALOG BOX
GLIMfjVK8_s_20 0 I'M GOING TO CHANGE IT FROM TWELVE POINTS TO LET'S SAY 72 POINTS
GLIMfjVK8_s_21 0 THAT CERTAINLY DOES THE TRICK AS FAR AS SIZE GOES
GLIMfjVK8_s_22 0 AND ANOTHER TRICK YOU CAN DO FOR DOING SOME SCRAPBOOKING IS TO TAKE YOUR BRUSH TOOL AND SELECT A FUN BRUSH SHAPE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE LEAVES
GLIMfjVK8_s_23 0 YOU CAN ALSO DOWNLOAD ANY NUMBER OF OF DIFFERENT BRUSHES THAT WILL GIVE YOU ALL SORTS OF SPECIAL EFFECTS
GLIMfjVK8_s_24 0 I HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT I WAS IN THE RIGHT LAYER
GLIMfjVK8_s_25 0 NOW AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS THIS IS JUST REAL QUICK AND SILLY AND NOW THIS I CAN EITHER PRINT OUT ON MY PRINTER AT HOME OR I CAN TAKE IT TO A A LOCAL PRINT HOUSE AND HAVE THEM PRINT IT OUT AND PASTE THAT RIGHT INTO A MY PHOTO BOOK MY SCRAPBOOK OR I CAN CREATE A DIGITAL SCRAPBOOK JUST BY BUILDING PAGES LIKE THIS
GLIMfjVK8_s_26 0 I HOPE THIS IS USEFUL TO YOU
GLIMfjVK8_s_27 0 I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND MUCH MORE CREATIVE WAYS OF SCRAPBOOKING BUT THIS IS A BASIC WAY OF HOW TO USE SOME OF PHOTOSHOP'S TOOLS TO GET THAT DONE
GLIMfjVK8_s_28 0 THIS IS STEVE ANTHONY AND THIS HAS BEEN HOW TO SCRAPBOOK WITH PHOTOSHOP CS3
gl6NxbWoQFk_1 0 WHEN YOU'RE MAKING A GRID YOU ARE GOING TO NEED CERTAIN MATERIALS
gl6NxbWoQFk_2 0 YOU ARE GOING TO NEED A RULER
gl6NxbWoQFk_3 0 I SUGGEST ONE WITH A CORK BACK BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO KEEP IT HOLD IT WHERE YOU NEED IT TO HOLD
gl6NxbWoQFk_4 0 A TRIANGLE IS A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THAT WAY YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET SQUARE
gl6NxbWoQFk_5 0 THAT'S HOW YOU SQUARE UP THINGS
gl6NxbWoQFk_6 0 YOU SET THE TRIANGLE AGAINST THE RULER AND WHERE THOSE TWO MEET IS GOING TO BE A FORTY-FIVE DEGREE A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE AND THAT'S USUALLY WHAT YOU WANT TO WORK WITH
gl6NxbWoQFk_7 0 SO YOU NEED THOSE THINGS
gl6NxbWoQFk_8 0 IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING WITHIN A CIRCLE YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO NEED A COMPASS AND TO DRAW YOUR GRID YOU'RE USUALLY GOING TO WANT TO USE A LIGHT WEIGHT PENCIL
gl6NxbWoQFk_9 0 FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH PENCIL WEIGHTS THEY GO FROM 9H AT ONE SIDE SO 9H IS OVER HERE TO 9H ON THE OTHER SIDE 9B ON THE OTHER SIDE
gl6NxbWoQFk_10 0 AND THE BS ARE DARK
gl6NxbWoQFk_11 0 AND YOU GO PROGRESSIVELY DARKER
gl6NxbWoQFk_12 0 A 9B IS AS DARK AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY GET
gl6NxbWoQFk_13 0 A 9H IS AS LIGHT AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY GET
gl6NxbWoQFk_14 0 AND THEN IN THE MIDDLE THEY HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH CALLED F H AND B AND THOSE ARE ALL SORT OF MEDIUM WEIGHTS
gl6NxbWoQFk_15 0 YOU WANT TO STICK TO THE LIGHT SIDE TO MAKE YOUR GRID BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO SEE THE LINES
gl6NxbWoQFk_16 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO END UP WITH AN OUTLINE OF YOUR GRID LIKE THIS SO YOU USE A LIGHT PENCIL TO MAKE THE GRID SO THAT YOU CAN ERASE IT LATER AND YOU DON'T HAVE THIS BIG GRID SITTING THERE IN THE MIDDLE
gL9O2HQ2tUg_1 0 LET'S ADD A CHEST LIFT TO OUR CHOO CHOO SHIMMY

GFJOtXf7z8c_1 0 WHEN YOU PICK OUT PRODUCTS THAT YOU ARE INVESTIGATING INGREDIENTS FOR AND YOU START READING LABELS YOU'LL FIND INCREDIBLY LONG LIST OF CHEMICALS
GFJOtXf7z8c_2 0 MOST OF THESE ARE TO INCREASE THE FOAMING ACTION TO INCREASE THE PRESERVATIVE CAPABILITIES BECAUSE OF MOST OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS ARE MADE IN HUGE BATCHES AND THEY NEED TO BE SHIPPED TO FAR DESTINATIONS IN ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES
