IF YOU ADD A SPINDLE THAT IT'S A LITTLE A IT'S EASIER TO ACTUALLY GENERALLY LOW BUT MORE POWERFUL SPIN WAS THAT INTO THE PRESENCE
OH IT'S REALLY NICE HE CAN HAVE A GIRL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CAN BOTH WE'RE ARM FUNDS EVERYONE'S TENTING CREATE AN A SPIN
ONE FOOT OR HAND RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE IS IN A YOU WILL SEE USE YOUR TWO FINGERS ARE PIGEON ME TO SPIN THE STRIKES
WHAT YOU WANT TO START LOOKING AT YOUR INSIDE SHOULDER WHICHEVER WAY YOU NATURALLY ONE A SPIN AND AS YOU AS YOU COME IN YOU POP AND YOU PUSH THE BIKE THROUGH <UNK> AT BUT YOU MAKE SURE TO KEEP LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER BECAUSE YOUR TO YOUR BODY BASE WE WILL FALL AWARE EVERY LOOK SO AS LONG AS YOU KEEP LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LAND JUST FINE
IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SPEND A COMPLETE ONE EIGHTY BECAUSE ONCE YOU START LEARNING AND YOU'LL CARRY MUCH BETTER SPEED RIDING OUT BACKWARDS IF YOU SPIN IT REALLY A COMPLETE ONE EIGHTY RATHER THAN SPINNING NO HUNDREDS SIXTY DEGREES OR SO WHERE YOU BASICALLY ARE GOING TO LAND IN A COMPLETE STOP
AND DEPENDING ON YOU KNOW WHAT A GREAT AND HOW MUCH ONE SPIN YOU MAY GET THICKER ALUMINUM WHICH MAKES A HEAVIER
FOR SPEED CHUCKS UNITY SPIN RENDER FINGER'S UNDER THONGS K AROUND WRIST
YOU DON'T NEED WHEN THE BALL AND YOU PROBABLY HAVE YOUR OWN SPIN ON EACH INDIVIDUAL TRICK
SO WHAT WE DO NOT OVER GETTING IN THE LONGER IRONS AND THEY'RE NOT QUITE AS LOFTED YOU GIVE IT A GENERATE MORE SIDE SPIN ON IT
SO YOU GET THE NORMAL UNDERSPIN OF STRIKING THE BALL WITH A CLOSE THE FACE LIKE THIS TO CREATE SOME SIDES AS THE BALL WILL SPIN AND GO TO THE LEFT
WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE FULL SPIN WITH OUR RIGHT STICK LIKE THIS BUT AT THE END OF IT READY TO GO LEG OVER THE TOP AND THROW UP IN THE MIDDLE
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO SPIN AROUND BY STAFF
ON EACH THROW HAS TO GO ACROSS SINGLE SPIN AND ONE MAKE SURE IT'S IN TIMES THAT'S THROW THROW CATCH CATCH
BECAUSE IF THERE WAS A BELOW DOWN HERE ON THE GROUND AND I WANTED TO SPIN THAT LOW IF LIKE THAT THAT CLUB HEAD AND IS WATCHING THE CLUB THAT IF I BROUGHT THAT CLUB HEAD INSIDE AND SWUNG THAT CLUB HEAD OUT AND BEFORE I GOT TO THAT GLOBE I RELEASED OR TURNED OVER OR FLIP THAT OVER
THAT IS GOING TO SPIN THAT GLOW
IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO SPIN IT DOES A LITTLE BIT TO HELP WORK THAT GREASE AROUND WHERE IT SHOULD BE
NOW THIS TECHNIQUE EASILY HIM THE BLOCKING BLOCK THE LEFT HAND LIKE THIS SPIN THE WAIST OVER TO THE LAP DROP THE RIGHT LEG DOWN FOLLOW THROUGH WITH A HOOK KICK
WHAT A SPIN BOILING HIGH FLAME IF THAT SHOT ON SUCH A THING
THAT'S UNDER THE LEG WITH A TASSEL SPIN
NOW WHAT I'M ACTUALLY DOING ISN'T SPINNING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE STICK GETTING IT OUTSIDE SPIN ON THE TASSEL TAKING MY LEG OVER LETTING THE STICK JUST ROLL OVER MY LEG LIKE THAT AND BACK OUT TO MY RIGHT CONTROL STICK JUST LIKE THAT
THE CREASE TASSEL SPIN TECHNIQUE IS VERY DIFFERENT
WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT DOING THIS WITH JUST THE NORMAL THICK TALK A NORMAL SPIN
AND NOW WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT DOING ITS BEEN TRIGGS WITH THE TASSEL SPIN
WILL EFFECT LOOK NICE AND LIGHT AND FLUFFY <UNK> AND A LOT OF CALORIES A ON IN HE THINKS OF GLASS OF IN THAT HE WANTED IT ON A DAILY BASIS AND STAY WITH A SPIN
SOME OF THE HEAD SPIN MY HOOK AROUND SO THAT MOUTH RINSE HANGING DOWN THAT MAKING CONTACT WITH THAT SHARP POINT AND I'M READY TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STEP
TOM THE LOWER THE LOFT MORE SIDE SPIN IT YET
WHEN THE FRIZZ BECOMES IN YOU DON'T WANT A CLOSURE HAND TOO EARLY YOU DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOUR HAND OPEN TOO LONG BECAUSE THE FRISBEE CAN THEN COMMAND AT YOUR HAND IN SPIN OUT
WHAT IS A TAKE ASPIRIN AND AROUND YOUR ARM ACROSS THE I LAID UP AGAINST MY BODY TO THE SIDE AND THAT'S ACTUALLY STRIKE AND OF ITSELF BUT WHEN YOU CAN TURN THAT INTO A SPIN BY TAKING IT ON FOR CROSSING YOUR ARMS CHANGING HANDS POSITIONS GUYS NOW YOUR RIGHT HAND IS PALM DOWN LEFT HAND PALM UP
SPIN IT ACROSS OR ARMS AND LAY DOWN SOME TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER IS GO BACK AND FORTH LIKE THAT
YOU'LL BE THIS BEAD STOMP ON THE NOSE AS A STOMP SPIN YOUR BODY THE DIRECTION THE ONE A TURN AND ON THIS AN OLLIE FRIENDS THAT ONE EIGHTY HAS BEEN WHERE YOU CAN SEE WE'RE TURNING THE MAKING IT EASIER OF THE TWO FOOT WITH WHEN YOU INCORPORATE THE PUSHING IN RIDING AROUND IN ALL THE OTHER PARTS OF THE AN OLLIE ONE EIGHTY HOT AND PUTTING TOGETHER IT LOOKS A LITTLE LESS
SO LETS THE URGE TO NOT SPIN ON IT S NOT LOOK ACTUALLY TILLAGE ROOTED AND USE IT OFF FOR WILL JUNK CARS LIST AND DENTISTRY OF
AND THAT'S IN THE A JUMP SEVEN TWENTY SPIN
DON'T LEAVE YOU JUST BEEN A SEVENTH WHEN YOU JUMP INCLUDE GARDEN SEE YOU NICE TIGHT SPIN IT IN AND THE LAST SECOND YOU THOUGHT RELATE TO DO K K
SO WHEN YOU JUMP ROPE CRACKS IN JUMPS AND THE ABILITY TO SPIN THE <UNK>
SO OVER AND GIVE HIM A LITTLE REALLY LOW START OPENING MY SHOULDERS <UNK> HIT LEASE THIS IN A PHYSICALLY SPIN MAY HAVE A FLAT HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREE FOR
IF A LIKE A SEVEN TO GET THESE ONE EIGHTIES YOU PROGRESS IN THE THREE SIXTIES WHICH IS TWO BALLS BANDS HOME FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE FORTY WHICH IS ONE AND A HALF FULL SPINS SO ON AND SO FORTH AND THEN BASICALLY THIS ONE EIGHTY IS THE STEPPING BLOCKED EVERY OTHER SPIN
NOW I'VE DONE ENOUGH SOME OTHER ONES WHERE THICK ENOUGH SPIN AROUND AND CATCH THE BALL AND THESE ARE FOR DOWN THE PATTERNS WHERE YOU ACTUALLY LOOKING BACK OVER YOUR SHOULDER AND IT'S THE TRUE IS WAY TOO DISORIENT YOURSELF AND LOCATE THE BALL OF THE SAME TIME
SONG OR TRY MY SAND WEDGE SO HERE I'M NOT TRYING TO SPIN IT OR PUT IT ON THE GREEN ON A START ADVANCE THE BALL TOWARD THE GRAIN OR TO GET IT TO THE GREEN WITH A FULL CLAW
NOW IN THIS PART WILL LEARN HOW TO DO OUR SPIN OKAY
OUR SPIN IS VERY IMPORTANT
NICE AND NOW YOU WANT A SPIN ON WHO ACTUALLY USE SOME SCIENCE HERE
SO TO DO THIS THAT FOR THE FOR THE NAIL DELAY YOU HONEST PUT SOME SPIN ON IT AND KEEP THAT NAIL RIGHT IN THE CENTER FOLLOWING THE SET AT ALL TIMES
IF YOU DON'T PUT A LOT OF SPIN ON IT FOR IS YOU CAN BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO DO A MALE THE WAY AND YOU WANT A FRISBEE COME DOWN NICE AND FLAT
SO WE ALSO WITH A NAIL DELAY YOU NEED TO PUT A LOT OF SPIN ON THE FRISBEE
EITHER USUALLY MADE OF PLASTIC A AND ONLY CAN GET SOME OLD ONES THAT ARE MADE OUT OF WOOD OUT THERE MAY NEED TO SPIN IN THE AIR OUT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PHYSICALLY SPIN IT WHEN YOU THROW IT IT PRETTY MUCH AUTOMATICALLY DOESN'T
NOW WHEN YOU'RE FIRST STARTING TO CATCH A FRISBEE IT WAS AT THE CANNA PAY ATTENTION TO THE SPIN
RIGHT NOW I'M REALLY GET OKAY NICE AND HIGH OFF THE BOARD YOU'D SEE A REALLY NICE TIGHT SPIN OKAY WHO SONG POINT PRIDE AND SEE HIM BUT IN THE AIR HE WAS LOOKING FOR THE WATER TO SPOT KICKED OUT NICE AND STRONG PACKET EXPANSION A BECAUSE STRESSES ARMS A LITTLE MORE BUT THAT WOULD REALLY GOOD REVERSE ONE HALF TOUGH
YOU CAN AVOID THAT BY LISTENING TO GUIDE AND PADDLING IF YOU HIT THE ROCK ANY LIGHTLY DODGE OUT THE HIGH SIDE INCLINED TOWARD THE HIGH SAUTED THE ROCK THE HIGH SORT OF THE ROCK AND THE LIGHT WILL COME OFF ALONGSIDE CAN SPIN OFF THAT ROCK SO READY POSTPONING CONTINUE ON DOWN STRAIGHT
SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW TO FIX IT BECAUSE THE REALLY EXPENSIVE YOU'LL JUST HAVE A BIND OF ONE OF THE TIME IT A COUPLE OF SO WHAT I DO IS I BLOW IT UP AS MUCH AS I CAN DO IS MUCH AREAS AS I CAN AND TAKE IT AND FOLD THE BACK HAVE AN SUBMERGE THE WHOLE THING IN THE BATH OF AND SPIN LIKE START LOOKING AND SEE WHERE THE LITTLE AIR BUBBLES ARE COMING AROUND YOU KNOW SO ONCE YOU FOUND THAT HE DRIVE THE SPOT BUT A SHARPIE LIKE X ON IT OR SOMETHING YOU MIGHT HAVE A COUPLE HOLES
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR SINGLE SPIN LIKE THIS DOWN PRETTY CLEAN AND THE FACT THAT YOU SHOULD DO IT FROM BOTH SIDES THE HIPS ARE ADDING IN YOUR REPERTOIRE OF TRICKS
HOWEVER BOTH ARE USED THE SPIN YOU
IF THE OVERHAND GROOMER THAT A KNIFE AND JUST SPIN THE INFANT CROWN
SPIN ELECTION TINY THE SHOE YOU ALL THIS PAINT OUT OF THAT RIM OF WE SEE THE BACK OF THE SKIN
WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ONE CLUB DO DOUBLE SPIN IT WILL CLUB TO SINGLES IT SOMETHING LIKE ALMOST LIKE THAT TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND BASICALLY THE REASON BEHIND THAT IS REPORTING SPIN ON THE AWFUL
SO I'M GOING TO SPIN IT CLOCKWISE SPIN I'M GOING TO DO ON THE LEAD PULLOUTS TO ANGLE SET TRY THAT AGAIN
NOW AGAIN YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE FIRST STARTING TO CATCH FRISBEES BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IT SPINNING IT HAS A LOT OF SPIN AND IT HITS YOUR PALM TENNIS BEEN RIGHT OUT
YOU CAN ACTUALLY BALANCE IT THERE WITHOUT IT SPINNING BUT IF YOU CAN PUT SOME SPIN ON A THIN HAVE THAT CLOG THE LENGTH AND THEN YOU CAN GO TO TWO FINGER IS AND THEN ONE FINGER WILL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GET CONTROL WHICH WILL OPEN UP THE DOOR TO MANY MANY MANY MORE TRICKS
IT'S AROUND IS AS MUCH PROTEINS PENDANT AS OR IS IN THE LOOP AROUND THE SPIN IS EQUAL TO POUND OF MEANS OR BROKEN
ON IT'S DOING LEAVES IN EARLY SPRING A CLUB CLOSING THE SPIN
SO I JUST PUSH IT AND SPIN UNTIL IT GETS
