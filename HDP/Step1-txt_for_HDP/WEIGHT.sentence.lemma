IN YOUR WHEN THE EIGHT WEIGHT TWO HOURS BEFORE YOU START DRINKING SO THAT YOU CAN DIGEST
TWO REASONS USUALLY I CAN VALANCE MIGHT WEIGHT OF MY IT'S CHEST IS OVER MY FEET
I HAVE NO WEIGHT INVOLVE WHATSOEVER
IF YOUR EYE DESPERATE AND ONE IN ANOTHER RIGHT AWAY THE BEST THING AS SOME PARALLEL TO THE BEACH WEIGHT IN YOUR ARMS AND KNOWING
AGAIN A PLASTER WEIGHT INTO YOUR ELBOWS LITTLE YOUR SHOULDERS BACK INHALE AND ALL BEEN THROUGH YOUR HIGHER
SOME HAVE WHAT'S HAVE ONLY NINETY POUND WEIGHT PAPER
NOW IF YOU'RE USING ALL THOSE VARIED RHYTHMS IT IN ESSENTIALLY DO THAT FOR FOUR MINUTES WORTH LIKED COUNT YOU DO AND THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT AND TAKE THREE TO DO TEN TO FIFTEEN REPS THREE FAT
AND ON OUR HIGH AND TODAY I SEE A LITTLE BIT OF DRYNESS CERTAIN AND THEN IT SHOES SKIN SMOOTHING CREAM A NICE MEDIUM WEIGHT MOISTURIZER
HEY AND WHAT THEY DO IF THEY DO THE SAME TYPES OF MOVEMENTS BUT DUE TO THE WEIGHT BEAN A LITTLE BIT HEAVIER ONE IN A MAJOR FLOWERS AND DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES A LOT FASTER IN THOSE AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF STAFF
ONE HAS A WITH ABOUT A MEDIUM WEIGHT ON IS THE ONLY REALLY A FEW OUNCES
SOME BIG GIVEN LIGHTER WEIGHT HOWEVER ARE ALL VERY DURABLE
SO IF YOU GO IN AND HAVE AN ADJUST DEAD YOU CAN OF WEIGHT ALL OF THAT
AND NOW HUMAN BEEN GOING AS A WEAPON TELLING YOU YOU'VE PROBABLY ALREADY GETTING A LITTLE BIT FAMILIAR WITH WHERE YOUR WEIGHT IS SUPPOSED TO GO
ITS OWN WEIGHT ON AND I WOULD MAKE SURE THEY CAST SOMETHING LIKE THIS FIRST
SO YOU HAVE YOU END UP WITH TWO BALL SOMEWHAT YOU CAN GET KIND OF WEIGHT AND IT'S NOT AN A BODY IS DOING THE POINT
IF HE IF WE GO VISIT KINDRAN THE WEIGHT AND YOU CAN JUST TAKE THEM OFF
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HYDRATE FOR YOUR CELLS HUMAN BRAIN FUNCTION IN DETOXIFYING YOUR BODY AND LOSING THE WEIGHT
GRAB UNDERNEATH WITH THIS HAND THUMB ON THE BACK OF THE HAND THE OTHER ONE COMES OVER ON SAT ENTERS SETS THAT ARE LEFT FOOT BACK IN A CIRCLE IF YOU REALLY WANT POWERED WEIGHT IS REST
NOW IF YOU'RE SWINGING YOUR BODY YOU'VE GOT TOO MUCH WEIGHT
KEEP YOUR WEIGHT OVER THE FOOT NOT HIT
SO WHEN I'M MAKING THE OUTSIDE OF ALL THIS UNLIKE I'M MAKING A PLATE COMPLETE FLATTENED OUT FLATTEN UP FLAT HAVE FIN THAT ONE AND WILL WEIGHT IN THE BOTTOM ONLY THE BAT GROWTH RATE THROUGH THE C THE BOW
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE PART OF THE STICK THAT STICKING OUT SHOULD BE BOWL EVENTUALLY EVEN SO THAT THE FRAME STAND STRAIGHT UP AND BUT BY THE WEIGHT OF THE THE BORDER THE THICKNESS OF THE CORRUGATED PAPER AND ALSO THE STICKS AND INSIDE THIS WILL CREATE A NICE STRONG STURDY SUPPORT TO LET THE BEYOND BORDER STAND UP STRAIGHT ON TO THE BASE OF THE STAGE
MY TO CONTROL THAT ANGLE AND WITHIN MY WEIGHT FORWARD <UNK> EVEN MORE FORCE WOULD ANGLES THE OTHER DIRECTION
OF A DEAL TEA APPROVED HELMET IN LATE WEIGHT
THICK SAMPLED FACES RACKET BODY HAS THAT ON THAT WEIGHT AND SEE AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S GETTING WORN OUT
NOW I HAVE A DOT AND I THAT WEIGHT AND THE PUBLIC CONDITION OF IT
THIS IS YOUR STANDARD FULL FACE HOME AND IT IS SNELL APPROVED IT IS A COMPOSITE PLANT TO HAS AGE WONDERFUL VENTILATION SYSTEM IS VERY LIGHT IN WEIGHT ADAM AS YOU CAN SEE IT COVERS THE WHOLE HEAD
NOT A WEIGHT HERE I SHOULD BRING MY WEIGHT FORWARD TO THIS KNEE SO THAT MY KNEE IN MY ANKLE RIGHT ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER
TURN ROCKING THE WEIGHT IS HERE IF AN EAGLE IN HEAT NEED THIS LEG ASSIGNING BEHIND
I TRACE ALONG THE BACK HERE AND YOU NOTICE VERY QUICKLY THAT THE DRAWING STARTS TO TAKE ON SOME MORE DEPTH SOME MORE WEIGHT THREE DIMENSIONAL ATTRIBUTES AS OPPOSED TO JUST HAVING THE GOOD BUT STILL ULTIMATELY QUICKLY SCRIBBLE LONG LINES WE STARTED WITH
AS THIS LEG IS COMING THROUGH ONE TO THIS LID ON AND LEAD WITH IT IS NOT ONLY GET HIT IN THE STONE IT WITHIN PSYCHIC WHEN THE WEIGHT IN
IF THE DOG IS OF TRYING TO OF WEIGHT COUGHING WHEN COUGHING BECOMES VERY UNCOMFORTABLE THE DOG CAN START OF WEIGHT COUGHING BY TAKING SHALLOW BRASS THE MORE SHALLOW BREATHS THEY TAKE THE LESS OXYGEN IS COMING IN AND IT WILL ACTUALLY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF BLOOD OXYGEN IN THE BODY
IT ACTS OF BOTH THE WEIGHT AND UP MEANS OF GETTING ATTENTION BY FLASHING AT THE FISH
THEN WHAT YOUR WEIGHT IN YOUR MOMENTUM CARRY BACK OVER A LITTLE FAKIE DOWN THE OTHER SIDE THAT'S WHERE FAKIE SKILLS COME INTO PLAY
THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS YOU GRAB THE ARM WITH BOTH OF YOUR ARMS AND YOU DROP YOUR WEIGHT DOWN INTO THE HORSE STANCE RIGHT AWAY FORCES THE PERSON DOWN TO OUR POSITION FOR THEM TO MAINTAIN THEIR WHOLE
FIRST THING GRAB THE ARMS SECOND YOU DROP AND YOUR DROP YOUR WEIGHT INTO A HORSE STANCE WHICH FORCES THE PERSON DATA THAT YOU GO TO SOME STRIKES OUT WON'T TAKE THE THE KNEE TURN BRING THE KNEE UP TO THE ELBOW AND STRIKE BEHIND THE KNEE
AND THEN PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR NOSE AND LET THE BACK WHEELS PICKUP PASS THE COPING AND CLEAR IT COMPLETELY AND THEN ROLL DOWN THE TRANSITION
FULL WHICH YOU WANNA MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IS BE ABLE TO PUT WEIGHT ON YOUR FRONT OF YOUR BOARD OR YOUR NOSE AND ACTUALLY IT BE ABLE TO MOVE PURPOSEFULLY PICK UP THE BACK WHEELS AND CLEAR THE COPING AND BE A BLACK AND ROLL BACK DOWN THE TRANSITION AND HAVE CONTROL
PALM UP ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS FOR WEIGHT TRAINING FOR WOMEN IS SO TO FIGHT DISEASES SUCH AS OSTEOPOROSIS AND AUSTRIA OFF RIGHT AS A WHICH ARE VERY COMMON IN OF WOMEN BUILDING THEY GET THE MORE PRONE THEY ARE TO IT
AND TODAY WE ARE HERE TO DISCUSS WEIGHT TRAINING FOR WOMEN
AND EVEN A SLOWLY EXHALE KEEPING YOUR HEAD BACK IN AND THEN PRIMARILY OF THE WAIST TAKEN THE WEIGHT DOWN TO WHERE THE SHINS

WHAT I'M DOING HERE IS AN MOVING OF QUICK EXPLOSIVE WEIGHT AND JUST FORWARD STARTING TO FROM FOOT OF BOTH FEET ARE MINE AND YET
SO IT REALLY ON THROW GETTING LOW STAYING LOW AND TRYING TO FORCE YOUR BODY WEIGHT DOWN THE WHEELS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN HIT A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE IN HOW STABLY RIDE IN HOW SUCCESSFUL YOUR WHEN YOU TRY NEW THING
THE BIG THING YOU'RE GOING FOR A UMPH FANATICALLY WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION WASN'T A MOUNTAIN BIKE IS HEAVIER WHEELS TO YOU KNOW HAVING WEIGHT EVENLY DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN YOUR TWO WHEELS AND DOING THAT ON IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS YOU TO CONTROL WE ARE DOING
AND THE MAJOR THING I KEEP COMING BACK TO OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT DISTRIBUTION WEIGHT THE SERVER THINK ON THE TACK POSITION WHICH IS NOT JUST LIKE IN SKIING WHERE LIKE THEM PARALLEL SHOULDERS SQUARED OFF TO THE HEALTH OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING FOR IN A CAN MAGICALLY
I CAN DROP MY CHEST A LITTLE BIT MORE TO PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON THAT FRONT WHEEL WHICH IS IMPORTANT ANYTIME YOU REALLY WANT FLOW DOWN IS MOST YOU BREAKING COMING FROM THE FRONT BRAKE AND IT'S YOU KNOW IMPORTANT ANYTIME YOU JUST NEED TO BE MORE STABLE
YOU WANT A PICK UP THE FRONT LEG IS WEIGHT KICK STRAIGHT OUT AND IN STRAIGHT BACK DOWN

ANOTHER HELPFUL THING IS IF THERE'S MORE WEIGHT CONCENTRATE ON THE FAR AND OFF
KEEP IN MIND THAT THE GARBAGE GENTLY HOLD OUT ON WEIGHT WHICH MEANS IF RAINY DAY COULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE FOR YOU TO PAY THE WHOLE THING
IF YOU HAVEN'T TRIED OUT TO PUSH DOWN ON SOMETHING IF YOU HAD A HEAVY WEIGHT FISCHLER DISTANCE YOU HAVE BETWEEN YOURSELF AND THAT WEIGHT THE HARDER IT IS THE PUSH BAM

SO IT'S IMPORTANT OF A STYLIST OR EVEN THE DESIGNER THERE TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE SHOWING THE JEWELRY THE MATES THE WEIGHT SUPPOSED TO BE MORE
WEIGHT ON THE RIGHT FOOT OF
SO THEY NEED TO DO SOMETHING UNDERNEATH BOTH THE AS A DECORATIVE FEATURE INTO IN CLOSE THE WEIGHT INSIDES OF WAS AN OUNCE WEENIE IN THE AIR
SO THEY WERE STILL DEALING WITH WEIGHT DRIVEN CLOCKS THE WEIGHT HANGING UNDERNEATH THE CLOCK WHICH POWERS IT
SO WHEN YOU HOLD THE WEIGHT

SOMEBODY HAS A BODY WE SWAT BECAUSE IT'S JUST YOUR BODY WEIGHT
SO THE KEY TO THAT IS IN MAKING SURE THE BOTTOM AREA IS GOING TO HANG A OR DRAPE THE WEIGHT PROBABLY WOULD WHEN A PERSON IS WEARING IT
YOU DON'T WANT TO PLACE A LOT OF WEIGHT ON YOUR HAT SEE YOUR HEAD IS BARELY TOUCHING

THE BODY TENDS TO GET OUT OF PHYSICAL BALANCE SO THE DOG WILL STAMP SLIGHTLY CROOKED PUTTING THE WEIGHT ON ONE LEG RATHER THAN THE OTHER
WE ALSO HAVE SPECIALTY TYPE OF SET UPS WHERE WE HAVE A HOOKS SWIVELS AND THE OUT I'M FLIES ATTACHED TO ALIGN WITH <UNK> OF AN EIGHT WEIGHT SINKER UP IN A DROP SINKER ON THE BOTTOM

THAT WAY IN A PAGE IT'S A LOT OF LESS WEIGHT IN BULK AND FILTER I ENDED PAINT YOU CAN ISSUES IODINE TABLETS OUT TO MAKE SURE WATERS OF RECENTLY POSSIBLE
OKAY THE ENTAILED IN A FEW BASIC ACTUALLY IS IT'S LESS THAT WE'VE FEET HIGH IS GOING TO WILL ELECTRONIC MEDICARE LATINS IN YOUR BACK IN AND THAT AND USE THE STEPS OUT AND WALK THE KNIFE NEW LAUGHED AT AN IN YOUR RIGHT HAND UNDERNEATH DURING THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE OVEN NICE DO AT OUR EYE

SO I'M MAKING MY WEIGHT IS SOMEWHAT OF A FAILURE FINE REVIEW FOR A FEW GRUNTS
LET YOUR BODY LEAD YOU AS YOU FEEL THE WEIGHT GOING DOWN AND UP A EVENTUALLY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TURN IN A FULL CIRCLE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS
IN YOUR FEET ARE GROUNDED AND GOT A PUSH A WEIGHT IN A HEEL IN ORDER TO KEEP THAT KNEE BEHIND THE TELL
SO THAT MY WEIGHT MY HIPS ARE FACING IN THIS DIRECTION

IN THE WEIGHT IS ON USING THE GIVE NICELY
I MEAN A QUELLED IN A KIND OF WEIGHT IS ALMOST A COOL OFF BECAUSE YOU MOVING ROUTE THESE VARIOUS PIECES AND PUTTING THEM INTO A DESIGN WITH EACH OTHER
