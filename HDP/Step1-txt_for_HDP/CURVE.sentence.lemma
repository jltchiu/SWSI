I HAVE A LOT OF THE DEMO HOUSES LIKE THAT LIKE CURVE IN RIGHT NOW I'M CAN EQ WE'RE BEER PRODUCTIONS THOSE HOUSES I'M DO A GREAT DEAL OF BUSINESS AND ENTER BEER REASONABLE RATE
THE REASON WE DO THAT IS IS IF THE FULL ITSELF WE COULD EASILY CAUSE A CURVE THAT IN THE GLIDER LITTLE ONE OF THE THAT'S WE START FLOWN THIS LEADING EDGE IF FLAMING LIGHTER OUT IF THAT ANY LINES FOLD
SHE CAN TAKE A STRAP AROUND THE BALLS OF YOUR TOE IS AN FOR SOME OF US THAT WE DON'T HAVE A CURVE IN THE LOW BACK WHICH IS LIST STAY UP MAY ACTUALLY STAYING MORE OKRAY AND TRAIN CREATED CURVE WILL GIVE YOU A REALLY GETS TRASH
ALL OUR IF YOU DO HAVE A CURVE AND GO AHEAD AND START TO FOLD FORWARD
CURVE OUT FIRST CURRENTS
MAKE THE HEAD AND THEN STRAIGHT LINE FOR THE ARM AND COME BACK TO THE EDGE AND THEN MAKE A LITTLE CURVE FIRST TURNS IN AND COME BACK DOWN
FOR A LIFE ALSO ON THE UP PASSERS I GIVE A LITTLE BIT BETTER VIEW FOR MORE OF A CURVE FILMING LOCATION
AS I MAKE SURE AS THEY LOOK OVER A TONGUE THAT THEY'RE IN THE CRACKS THAT HAPPEN WHEN THE CURVE IT SO ADDING A LITTLE BIT OF WATER AND SMOOTHING IT OUT OF THE HELPFUL
IF YOU WANTED TO CUT THE BALL TO THE LEFT AND A CUTTER FASTBALL YOU POSITION FINGERS ON TO THE LEFT HALF A BALL TO CREATE SPAN AND MOVEMENT THAT WOULD MAKE THE BALL BASICALLY CURVE TO THE RIGHT
MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A KNIFE THE CURVE ON THE TOP AND IF YOU NEED TO APPLY A LITTLE MORE ANYWHERE YOU SEE FIT
HEY THE BOTTOM OF IT IS AN CURVE OUT AND HIS AND CURVE IN AN INVERTED ENCOUNTER SCOUTING IT'LL IT WITH THE ARM AND I HIT IT HEART A
EACH TINY CURVE IT AROUND IN ONE HAND AT MASHED DOWN THE WIRE THAT
IS BASICALLY THE BELT UNWEIGHTED HIS REINFORCING THAT AVOIDING CURVE IN
SO IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE VERTEBRAE OR YOUR BACK OUR ROUNDING THE BACK BECAUSE YOUR HAMSTRINGS ARE HIGH A OR ABDOMINALS AND TIE A CLEANSING JUST SET OUT ON A PLANE GET OR A GLASS AND TELL HIM GET A CURVE IN YOUR LOWER BACK
IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT WHEN MIDI SEATED HIP OPENERS OF FOR EVENTS AND TWIST IT WE CREATE A NATURAL CURVE IN THE LOWER BACK BEFORE WE BEND FORWARD
AND BEFORE WE GO TO THE NEXT POSE IS WHAT I HAVE A CURVE IN YOUR LOWER BACK
AND REALLY GOOD WAY TO LEARN AT AN EXIT FROM THE FIFTY FIFTY GRINDS WORTH LEARN ON ALL THE AND OF LENGTH IS IS SOMETIMES IS SET UP YOUR WORK ON A LEDGE OR CURVE SAFELY IF ENDS FIFTH AND JUST WORK ON FALLING OUT OF THE POSITION
THE HAND START OUT TO THE RIGHT MY MY LOWER HANNAH MY LEFT HAND WILL BE DOWN BY MY CENTER OF MY RIGHT HAND A BEAT AND NOT LOCKS AND HAVE A NICE HURT GYM CURVE TO IT
IF YOU SEE YOUR HIPS TUCKED UNDER LUMBAR CURVE FLINT ANY OTHER DIRECTION YOU'RE GOING TO FAR AND LIGHTLY HASSEN FLEXIBILITY AGE
I'M HARVEY WOODED OWNER CURVE AGAIN HERE IN OREM UTAH
AND THEN YOU HAVE FLUFF OF PRETTY GOOD PROJECT FOR A GOOD WOODWORKER TO DO CURVE VENEER REPLACEMENT IN A AND THE THING
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO TRIM THE BOTTOM IN A CIRCLE FEITH THAT LITTLE BIT OF A CURVE
AND NOW WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS YOU PUT MY HAND ON THE FLOOR OR ON A CURVE IT AROUND THE BASE THAT THOSE TWO OR THE BALANCE TRAINER
THEN AGAIN INHALE PUSH YOUR FINGERTIPS INTO THE AIR AND AN LENGTHEN YOUR SPINE WAY OF AND FEEL THAT CURVE IN YOUR LOWER BACK AND ALSO THE LOWER VALLEYS LIFTING UP
UP HIGH OF AN OFF THE END IF HOW IT S A CURVE TILL THE DRIFT HAS ENOUGH WITH TOO MUCH WITH
SO USE A LOT OF THINK MOTION AND JUST THOUGHT OF HOT WORRY TOO MUCH HOFFA AND HAVE HAS THE HOOP TO USE FOR OF VODKA ESSENCE OF HER UP WITH A HOT HALF OF CURVE HOP HOP HOP HOP
IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE CALL IT A STRAIGHT CURVE
SO ONCE YOU CAN MAINTAIN FOR THREE ENGINE IS IN COMING OFF THE BALL OF THE CURVE IN TWO HUNDRED METERS IF YOU HAVE TO RUN A HALF TO LEARN TO ONE RELAX WHICH I MEAN WITH I MEAN BY THAT IS ONE A RELAX HELPS TO RUN FASTER
AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET MORE OF A CURVE WHEN YOU'RE WANTING TO DO A CURVE DESIGN
I PREFER EITHER EAR AND FOLLOW THE CURVE OF MY HEAD SHAPE TAPERING OFF AT THE NECK
HANNAH MEANS WE'RE DESIRE BOX AND READ WILL SHORT BOTTOM END IN A TUBE TOP WITH HIS RAT GIVING IT MORE OF A LAYER EVEN MORE WHERE AS OPPOSED TO HIS THAT YOU'VE GOT IT ACROSS TO THAT WEIGHT HAND MIXES DOES THAT THINGS BOARDING ENDING IN ONE OF THEIR INSULATED ISN'T USE THE BODY TO DRAW MY DESIGN ON THE ACTUAL WHATEVER IS ON THE LINING LIGHTEN THE LINES ON THE LAZY CURVE WEARING THIS CURVE IT DOES HAVE THE GIVE IT MORE MOVEMENT MORE ELEGANCE TO THE END FOODS LITTLE DRY WHICH IS PRETTY SELF EXPLANATORY THE TUBE TOP STRAPS TRACK AND THEN DITLOW IN THE FRONT AND KEEP IT'LL LOOK AT LIGHTING OR THREE IN
UM AND THEN YOU HAVE THESE PIECES THESE LITTLE CURVE PIECES THAT WILL HOLD THE HOOP TUBING AND IN NINE INTACT OVER THE CORNER OF THE LIP OF THE TAKES YES THE LIP THERE
I'M SO WE'RE GOING TO START UP HERE CURVE SLIGHTLY COME DOWN CURVES SLIGHTLY THE OTHER WAY
OUT WHILE I'M IS DO YOU CURVE
WE CAN GRAB YOUR CURVE AT ANY POINT AND PULL IT UP AND DOWN
YOU HAVE THE STICK WHICH NOTICES CURVE INWARD AGREE DEGREE THE HAIR AND IT IS AND THE NAP TIGHT IN THE HAIR
NOW IN AND DO IS DRAW THE EYES BUT WHAT WE CAN DRAW A AS WE NEED TO DRAW A LINE THROUGH THE CENTER IN IS A CURVE LAB AND IT IS GOING AROUND THE CURVE OBJECT
IT'S NOT AS EASY TO DO YOU CAN ALSO KEEP IT STRAIGHT IF YOU WANT BUT I LIKE THE CURVE WILL PUT IT RIGHT OVER THE TOP
SO BASICALLY ANY SITUATION THAT YOU HAVE MASSAGE THERAPY IN ONE WHERE ANOTHER WILL BE ABLE TO HELP YOU IN BENEFIT YOU TO BECOME A BETTER CURVE IN IN THE LETTER ABOUT YOURSELF AN WITH YOURSELF
ONCE IT'S ON PAGE CURVE WE THEN TAKE A BODY PART AND PUT IT ON C THAT FITS RIGHT
IN A PULL UP NEXT TO THE CAR AND SO YOUR REAR TIRES ARE PRETTY MUCH AT THE REAR OF THE CAR THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE PARKING BEHIND AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THE CARD REVERSED TURN YOUR WHEELS AND SLOWLY START BACKING UP AND THEN ONCE YOU GET ABOUT HALFWAY BACK TOWARDS THE CURVE AND DIFFERENT TIRES ARE CLEAR OF THE CAR IN FRONT OF YOU'VE BEEN GOING START STIRRING THAT THE OTHER WITH AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SLIDE RIGHT IN THERE AND THE RIGHT BEHIND THE CAR
ON THE NEXT IS A CURVE BARBELL WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE BELLY JEWEL IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE JEWELRY IN THE OVEN IS NOT A BIG ON THE BOTTOM BALLS OF THE SAME SIZE BOTH SCREW ON AND SCREW OFF
