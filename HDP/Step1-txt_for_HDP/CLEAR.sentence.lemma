WE'LL TRY THE OTHER SIDE JUST SO THAT MOOCH WORK THAT WE WERE CLEAR IN OUR DEMONSTRATION
IF AT THAT POINT WE WANT COME BACK AND JUST CLEAR HALF EACH OF THE RISERS
SOME PEOPLE ON WHO WILL DIP HIT V ON PIECES INTO A CLEAR GLAZE AND OTHER SEASON PAINTED ON ON
I REALLY LIKE THE NONABRASIVE NICE AND BIG THING BECAUSE REALLY ARE NOT TOUCHING THE PIECES A WHOLE LOT AND WHEN YOU RPG ARE CLEAR GLAZE ON WHAT CAN HAPPEN IS YOU AS SOON AS THE PIECE GETS WET YOU RE ACTIVATE THE PAINT ON AND ONE OF HEAT REACTIVATED IT'S VERY EASY FOR YOU TO START MOVING IT WHEN YOU ARE BRUSHING IT ON
<UNK> WE ARE ON A IN THE BARRACKS ONCES OF AROUND WITH GROOVES AND NOW WE'VE GOT A FUN WAY TO SAVE OUR GUYS IN CLEAR THESE ROOTS OUT OF THERE
AND IN WITH THE TIRE LEVER GO AROUND THE EDGE OF THE TIRE COLLECT HALF A CUP AND CLEAR TO BOUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOT REMOVE YOUR TIRE BUT TAKE YOU TO ABOUT IF IT'S AN AIR IN OR TO NOW WILL ENABLE YOU TO GO AROUND TO THE TUBE WITH THE CONTENT IT FEEL WITH YOUR HAND OR LISTEN WITH YOUR EAR AND SEE HE CAN FEEL A SMALL PUNCTURE OR HERE SO AIR COMING OUT OR SPOT WHERE WHERE MAYBE BULGING WHERE THE MAYBE SOMETHING STOCK IN THE TO RECEIVE EATING FEEL ANYTHING SHARPER SEED MAYBE IN A GLASS THAT MAY HAVE GONE THROUGH THE TIRE INTO THE TUBE
HAVE A LOT OF AS A BECOME CLEAR AS WE GO THROUGH THE SEQUENCES OF THE ACTUAL BEAD MAKING STEPS
AND WHEN CLEAR OF HER HOLLOW IT HAS
THEN YOU GET THAT AND LEAD WHEN THE ENSEMBLE AND RESPECT WITH THE MUSIC AND THEY NEED TO USE CLEAR CONDUCTING GESTURES
AND THEN PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR NOSE AND LET THE BACK WHEELS PICKUP PASS THE COPING AND CLEAR IT COMPLETELY AND THEN ROLL DOWN THE TRANSITION
FULL WHICH YOU WANNA MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IS BE ABLE TO PUT WEIGHT ON YOUR FRONT OF YOUR BOARD OR YOUR NOSE AND ACTUALLY IT BE ABLE TO MOVE PURPOSEFULLY PICK UP THE BACK WHEELS AND CLEAR THE COPING AND BE A BLACK AND ROLL BACK DOWN THE TRANSITION AND HAVE CONTROL
ON ORNAMENTS LIKE THIS THAT ARE THE CHARACTERS I USUALLY TAKE A BOWL OF SOAPY WATER AND ONE OF CLEAR
YOU CAN AGAIN CLEAR THIS OUT OF THE ONE TO RESTART
BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO A CLEAR AREA THAT I SEE QUICKLY
WE GO FLAT AND NEXT SET OF FLOW AND LAST SINGER INTO OUR GOING POUR THIS IN A GLASS HALF AND WE'RE OF FLOATS SOME EVER CLEAR ON TOP WHICH IS GONNA BE AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE PROOF AND I CAN GO ALL THE WAY UP TO A HUNDRED EIGHTY PROOF SUCKY FLOAT THAT ON TOP OF FULL SHOT AND IT'S GREAT ABOUT THIS IS IF YOU WANT YOU CAN LIKE THAT ON FIRE AND FIND SOME WAY OF DRINKING IT
SO CHALK IS A WONDERFUL MEDIUM OR HIM I THINK IS VERY CHALKY BUT ONCE YOU GET IN WAS HANDSTAND AND BETTER IT ACTUALLY DOES TAKE A FIXATIVE NOW TO WORKABLE FIXATIVE IN CLEAR
WE GOT A DAY YOU CAN FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH IT'S WORTH IN CLEAR THAT TO WHAT PRICE THAT THEY'RE ASKING
MAKE SURE YOU MAKE EACH DOT CLEAR
BUT THAT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT YOU CAN SEE THE REACTION CLEAR WHILE

THEY'RE ALL CLEAR JUST LIKE THIS THAT OFF
BUT WET SCIENTISTS AREN'T RESEARCH UP PRETTY CLEAR OUT OF THIS CLAY IS THAT CRACK STRENGTH TO SCAN AS AN OVERALL NEGATIVE FACT ON YOUR PHYSICAL HOLE IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS
SO INSTEAD OF TAKING EACH CHECK MARK OUT OF THOSE BLANK FEEL THE EASIEST THING TO DO IS REALLY OF A FEW NAMES WE WANT TO USE IS TO CLEAR ALL AND EVERYTHING WILL BE EMPTY AND THEN IT'S MUCH EASIER JUST TO CHECK THE ONES WE WANT INSTEAD OF GOING ALL THE WAY DOWN THE LIST AND UNCHECK THE EVERYTHING
AND THAT'LL HELP THE AND THE IMAGE SHOW MUCH MORE CLEAR
THE NEXT STEP IS TO DETERMINE OF THE NAIL LENGTH AND SOME NAILS ARE BLACK SOME NAILS ARE CLEAR WHICH MAKES A LITTLE EASIER TO IDENTIFY THE QUICK OR THE RED HEART INSIDE THE NAIL
AND NOW AND DO OUR NEXT ONE AND PLACE IT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE I'M AND THE REASON WHY WE'RE PUTTING IT ON THE EACH OF THE SITES FIRST IS BECAUSE THEN WHEN WE PUT OUR RIBBON ON THE TOP IT'S CAN A CROSSOVER AND MAKE A NICE CLEAR OWNER AND I LIKE WHEN CORNERS OR I LOOK ALL THAT WE'VE PLANTED OUT EVERY HALF
I THINK I'LL DO SOME MORE SO ANOTHER METHOD THAT I DID WAS TO TAKE A PICTURE OF THE STAFF YOU IN A GARDEN AND THEN I COVERED THAT WITH CLEAR WAX AND IN THIS CASE HEIGHT PUT DOWN SOME TISSUE PAPER AND THEN I SHOWED THE THREADS OF THE TISSUE PAPER THROUGH THE WAX HAND COLORED ON TOP OF THAT SURFACE TO CREATE THIS EFFECT IN IT IT'S THE IT HAS AN INTERESTING TRANSITION FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH TO THE WAX COATING
I DIDN'T PUT CLEAR WAX DOWN FIRST JUST LIKE WITH RUBBER STAMPS BUT I GOT THIS IMAGE WHICH WAS THE FIRST ONE I TRIED IN IT BECAME VERY POPULAR
SO IT'S CRITICAL TO TRY AND BACKLIGHTS ODD JEWELRY A FEW TWINE GETTING A PURE WHITE BACKGROUND AND THE WAY OF DOING THAT IT I THINK THE BEST WAY OF DOING THAT IS A PIECE OF CLEAR WHITE ARE PLEXIGLASS THAT CAN ALLOW THE LIKE TO COME THROUGH AND GIVE YOU THAT WHITE BACKGROUND WITHOUT OVEREXPOSING THE JEWELRY ITSELF
IT'S A VERY CLEAR PIECE OF PLASTIC AND THIS IS GOING TO AND GO OVER THE PICTURE INTO PROTECTED
WE CAN USE IT TO SEPARATE THE TOP SO WE HAVE A CLEAR DEFINED EDGE
ON THE OTHER WAY THOUGH TO MEAN MOUND LOSS IN A BY MIXING A CLEAR WITH THE INK OR LIGHT PINK AND AND OUR TANK
SO IN THIS CASE RIGHT HERE WITH HIS BLUEBERRY PEACH FLYING IT'S CLEAR IS NOT HOBBLING ANYMORE SO IT'S READY TO TAKE A AND BOTTLE
AND THAT WILL CLEAR THE HIPS ARE THE TOPIC OF THE BACK A LOT LOWER BACK BRAKE
