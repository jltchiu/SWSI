THE SECOND THING THEY WANT TO DO IS GET A FULL COURT SHOT
YOU COULD HAVE WILL USE A TENNIS COURT WHICH EVENTUALLY HELPER GAME BUT YOU DON'T MISS SONY THAT
SO ON THAT JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN YOU PLAY RIGHT ON THE HALF COURT LIFE SO
NOW WHEN YOU FIRST AID IN THE BALL OUT IF YOU WANNA YOU DEFINITELY ONE OF THE CROSS THE HALF COURT LINE BEFORE EIGHT TO TEN SECONDS
USE THE TEN SECONDS AND MY DAY WHEN OTTLEY FLUFF OF SEEING WHERE THEY COUNTED THEY'VE CANDIDATE SO YOU WON'T GET THAT IN MIND WHENEVER YOU PLAY A BALL THAT YOU GET A CAUSE THE HALF COURT LINE AND YOU CAN NEVER CAN NEVER PASS IT BACK ACROSS THAT THAT WAS MOTIONS CROSSOVER INTO THE OFF IT'S OF THE DIFFERENT CORE
WE'VE GOT A LOT HAVE COURT LINE YOU ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND THAT ONCE YOU CAUSE AS A TEAM ANYONE ALL ON THE OFF IT'S ONCE YOU CROSS BACK CAUSE THAT LINE WHICH ACROSS THAT LINE YOU CANNOT CROSS BACK
ONE OTHER THING WE TALKED ABOUT THE HALF COURT LINE AND COMES ACROSS RIGHT ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE FOOT
THIS IS A PHOTO OR A POSTER WITH A WHITE BACK AND I'LL WHITES OF FULL COURT BACK
SO IF YOU GET WHEN I'M WANT OUT TO HIS LITTLE FOR THE FRONT COURT TO GET RID OF
FOR EXAMPLE THE FIRST INVERSION WHICH IS OVER AND TALK ABOUT HERE IS OUR WE SPELL OUT FROM THE THIRD OF THE CHORD A AS OPPOSED TO THE ROOT OF THE COURT
AND IF YOU DIMENSION TASMANIA THIGH AND THAT EVEN IN ITALY IN THE FRONT COURT OF FOR EXAMPLE IN THE MEN'S METHOD IS IN THE LINES
AND PUT A MINUTE SHARE THEM ON THE COURT
SO YOU WANT TO DO SOME STRETCHES GET WARMED UP AND GET RID OF THE COURT QUICKLY
WHEN YOU KEEPING AN OPENING IT MORE SURFACE AREA ON THE BALL WHICH CAN HELP YOU TO GUIDE THE BALL TO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE COURT
WOULD HAS GOT WITH YOU TO DO IS IT CAN STILL THORTON THE QUARTERS AND BASICALLY HITS OF PHUT CROSS COURT THAT SKIPPING TOWARD THAT DIRECTION WITH HIS LEFT FOOT
THE COURT IS THIS RAISED AREA
AND THEN DON'T FORGET ABOUT DRESSING COMFORTABLY MOST COURT ROOMS ARE A VERY VERY COLD SO YOU'LL PROBABLY WANT ADDRESS IN LAYERS THEN WHEN YOU GET THERE IF IT'S COLD YOU DRESS APPROPRIATELY IF IT'S NOT THAT COLD YOU COULD REMOVE SOME OF THE LETTERS
WITH NICE IN COURT NEEDED
WE CAN DO THE FIRST INVERSION OF IT ALREADY STARTING ON THE THIRD OF THE COURT
IF YOU DRAW FROM THE STOCK YOU AT THE COURT TO YOUR HAND WITHOUT SHOWING IT TO THE OTHER PLAYERS
REALLY CARDS WILL BE FACE DOWN CALL THE WHOLE COURT
THE SOLES ON THE SHOES KINDA I'M CAN ADD LEAVES SCOUTS ON A TENNIS COURT WHICH JAB TEND TO RUIN THE OF THE CHORD A WITH FASTER
IT'S REALLY MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN YOU'RE USING IT ON THE SIDE OF THE COURT
THIS IS IN ACTUALLY LINE IT UP ALL YOUR CUP AND HALF COURT LINE JUST LIKE OUT TONY BEFORE
SO ON A JUST TAKE THIS AND MOVE THE ROOT UP TO THE TOP OF THE COURT
YOU CAN ALWAYS PLAY TENNIS ON THE SIDE OF A WALL OR BACK OR SO TENNIS COURT IS DELT FLY OPTIONAL WHEN ON IS COMING TO PLAYING TENNIS
SO OF MY TEAM SERVE THE BALL BUT AT THE OTHER TEAM GETS THE BALL AND PUTS IT INTO OUR SIDE OF THE COURT AND THEY GET THE POINT EVEN THOUGH THEY INSERT THE BALL AND VICE VERSA
THIS IS THE COURT
INVERSIONS OR WHERE YOU START OFF ON A DIFFERENT NOTE OF THE COURT ASIDE FROM THE ROPE WILL GET INTO EXAMPLES OF THAT LATER ON ONLY GET IN
WHATEVER SHOE YOU WIRING COURT ROOM A TIE ARROW BUSINESS SUIT OF SOME SORT AND A PANTS FIT LOOSELY ALL YOU COULD YOU KNOW ACTUALLY TAXES INSIDE OF YOUR THEIR ANKLE AND PUT A PENCIL AND YOU NEVER KNOW
THE BALL OR ACTUALLY SMALL FOR WILL HAVE THIS RESPONSIBILITY I HEAR ANYTHING BEYOND THAT POINT GUARDS REACH IS ON ON THIS SIDE OF THE COURT WILL BE THAT SMALL FORCE RESPONSIBILITY
