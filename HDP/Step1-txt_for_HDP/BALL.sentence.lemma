HI MY NAME IS BRANDON SARKIS ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY WE JOHANNA MAKE HOLIDAY PUTTING ALL OF IT NOW YOU'VE GOT AN <UNK> ON THE BOTTOM BATTER ACTUAL IN WITH THE GRIP TAPE OR MOLASSES NOW ONE AT ALL OF THAT IN ONE IN BARTLETT AROUND NOT UNDER THE NUT <UNK> THAT ARE ALREADY GOOGLE AND IN A DIFFERENT INGREDIENT ON <UNK> I'M WITH <UNK> AND ALL OF THE NERVE VIA THEY'RE ALL EFFECT WITH A GRIPPING AND BEING THEM IN <UNK> PRODUCT IN THE FROM THEM FOR YOU YOU KNOW YOU LOVE THEM GO IN THE OLD MODEL OF THEM NOW WOULD READ THE BALL BACK UP A LITTLE ETHER LETTING UP AND OUT THE BIG OF A GROUPING THAT UP AND THE AND OF LOOKING LIKE A I'VE CUT LIKE A REALLY TOWARD PICK A MINTY OF THINKING THAT AROMA OF OR THREE DIFFERENT OF TRAVEL THAT <UNK> IN OUR LOOK WITH NO UNTIL THEY LEARNED A LOT OF A TAKE A MOMENT SO I'LL COME BACK WITH THE POINT IN ONE ONE OF THE FOOT IT HAS BEEN A FEW MINUTES YOU CAN SEE THE ENOUGH THAT IF THE LUMPS THERE'S THE CUFF <UNK> AND IF IT IS A <UNK> HALF IF SEVERELY SLOWLY AND LOAF OF TALKING LIFE AND TRIPLE IF A ELEGANCE DOING IS
BALL COMES OUT OVER THEIR HADN'T AND THAT'LL GIVE THE FILE CALLED BECAUSE THE THAT THAT THE PLAYER THAT ARE TRYING TO BOX OUT IS EASILY ABLE TO GET THE RIBBON
MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH SPACE IN BETWEEN YOUR SELF AND THE RIM SO WHEN THE BALL COMES OFF INTO REBOUNDING EASILY
MY FAVORITE THING THE BALL IS GROWN WITH
ROLL ON MOST OF THEM ARE EQUIPPED WITH LIKE A BALL BEARING TIGHT SWIVEL AT THE VERY END ON SO THAT MAY SYMBOL BUT FASTER ON AND THE JUMP ROPE IS OUT OF THE BALL THAT INSIDE THE HANDLE
YOUR KNEELING HANDS GET PLACED ON THE BALL KIND OF LIKE A KARATE CHOP AND PUSH THE BALL OUT BENDING AT THE HIPS AND THEN USING THE ELBOWS TO DRIVE THE BALL INTO THE SIDE AND BACK UP
LET TELLS US THE BALL CAP EITHER NEEDS A NEW WASHER AND BE REBUILT OR WITHIN A CHANGE
SO THIS CLIPPER HIM WUNSCHEL YOU ABOUT HIP MOVEMENT IT'S ALL ONE BALL WHERE THE BODY IS THE NO
VERY TO THIS AND I USUALLY TURN WHEN YOU HIT THE BALL
SO ON THE HIP SHOULDER TURN IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT'S HOW YOU HIT THE BALL STRAIGHT TRUE IN FAR
AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOUR PEN OR HAVE SO THEY ARE THE OUTLINE DRAW A CIRCLE ABOUT THE SIZE OF YOUR BALL OF THE BODY OF YOUR BEAN BAG FEAR LADYBUGS
SO YOU HAVE YOU END UP WITH TWO BALL SOMEWHAT YOU CAN GET KIND OF WEIGHT AND IT'S NOT AN A BODY IS DOING THE POINT
IN THE SEVENTH THAT'S THE ONLY AND YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO TENSE IS TO PUT THE BALL INSIDE THIS SMALL SQUARE AND CUT SHIELD INSIDE THE SERVICE LINE
A CATCH THE BALL
AND NUMBER SEVEN IF YOU TURN IT OVER BEFORE THAT CLUB HEAD HITS THE BALL YOU'RE GOING TO HOOK
NUMBER THREE OR IF YOU GET YOUR HANDS IN FRONT OF THE BALL
NUMBER FOUR IF YOU PLAY THE BALL A LITTLE FURTHER BACK IN YOUR STANCE
NOW WHAT'S THE BLUE BALL
WE'VE LOOKED AT ONE BALL EARLIER THAT TECHNOLOGY OUR INNER ACTIVE TYPES OF LINES LEAVE LIFTED OTHER BOOKS THAT HAVE GRINDS IN TONGUE TWISTERS
HERE'S A LEAD THE BLUE BALL IS DOING A REVERSE CASCADE
SO IT'S LIKE THROW AT DOG THEORETICALLY THE HIT THAT BALL TO A NICE LOFT
I'M ON THE HEAVY REAL LOOSE <UNK> OR ON THE KNEES BOUNCE AND IS NICE AND RELAXED AND IS GET UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND LET THE CLUB DO THE WORK YOU A GREAT SUCCESS
SEE THE THE HOLES IN THE BOTTLE EXPLAINABLE WILL BUT MORE BEFORE THEY'RE YO IS YOU PUT THE SHEESH RIGHT THERE AND WHEN THE OF HEAT IT STRONG THROUGH PULL THE SHE CHEF THROUGH THOSE HOLES THROUGH THEM AND GO SO ON THIS TINY LITTLE BALL
WATT CONSIDERING YOUR OTHER OPTION IS REALLY A OF SILICONE JUGGLING BALL THAT RUN ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY TO FIFTY DOLLARS A PIECE
ANOTHER THING WE CAN DO IS STANDING BEHIND THE BALL IS WORKING ON OUR VERTICAL LEAP
AS WELL YOU CAN JUMP OVER THE BALL AND THAT BEHIND THE BALL AND OVER THE BALL AND BEHIND THE BALL
THE STEP OVER AND JUMPING OVER THE BALL DOES IS IF YOU'RE JUMPING OVER DEFENDERS YOU'RE GOING DOWN THE FIELD
AND HERE AND PUSH BACK PRESSING AGAINST THE INFLATED BALL AND RELAXING THE SHOULDERS AND BACK FORWARD
IF YOU PUSH THAT IT'S A VERY SMALL MOVEMENT AND THEN COME FORWARD KEEP YOUR BACK NICE AND STRAIGHT PUSH BACK GETTING THAT RESISTANCE OF THE BALL TO INITIAL THE GLUTES AND THEN COME FOR
CANNAS CLIP FOR A V USING A ON AND INFLATABLE BALL HELP STRENGTHEN THE LOW BACK
WE ONE REMAIN ON THE BALL THE FOOT AND NOT FLAT HEEL
AND WHAT THIS ALLOWS THE HAPPEN IS AND A LOT OF CASES WHEN IT'S AROUND BALL HAS BEEN A BALL THIS MAN OUT AND THE RUNNING BACK SHOULD HAVE THE SMART TO GO OFF OF HIS BUT
AND RAISE THE BALL A LITTLE ON RIGHT UNDER THE MANA
TO START WITH YOUR FEET ARE AT A SHOULDER DISTANCE UNIT TURN YOUR BODY TO THE RIGHT AS YOU'RE TURNING TO THE RIGHT YOUR RIGHT HEEL TURNS AND YOUR LEFT FOOT TURNS ON THE BALL THE FOOT
WHO IN WHICH YOU WOULD DO IS WE LIVE UP THERE AND I'M LADIES AND MOVE ON WITH THE BALL AND WITH THIS HAND GUIDING SO ISN'T GOING ANY OTHER DIRECT THE SIDES AND CATCH AND GOING TOWARDS IT AND MOVE THE BALL UP AND ROLL IT WITH THINGS
BALL GOES HERE THIS GUY DRIBBLE THAT IN THIS GUY STAYS BEHIND HIT THE DEFENSE TO COMMIT HERE REVERSE THE BALL TO THIS GUY
LET THE BALL TAKEN THAT GUY TAKE THE BALL OUT OF BOUNDS
OR THE <UNK> TO HIT A LITTLE EXTRA DISTANCE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU DRAW THE BALL
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT A LOT OF BEGINNING PLAYERS DO THAT REALLY IS NOT PROPER IS PUTTING THE CUE BALL TOO FAR BACK WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TO LIFT THIS IS TO TRAVEL FROM THAT POINT UP TO THERE
WE DON'T WHEN USING THE ENGLISH SQUIRT CUE BALL OFF ONE SIDE OF THE OTHER
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS BALL COMING UP OFF THE TABLE AND WE WANT TO GO STRAIGHT DOWN HERE
WE WANT A CONTACT THAT BALL WILL AND WE WANT TO HIT IT AS FAST AS WE CAN
IT A DIFFERENT TYPES OF WITH EVEN DO IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS PIGEON FOOTED AN ANGLE THE BINDINGS FACING IN TOWARDS EACH OTHER DUCK FOOTED AN ANGLE THE EYE THINGS AWAY FROM EACH OTHER FORWARD WHICH IS THE STANDARD WAY TO DO IT OR YOU CAN ALSO SET UP IN THE ALPINE OR RACING POSITION WHICH IS AN EXTREME FORM OF THE FLOOR POSITION WEIGHTED BALL CLIMBING AND ALMOST WANT A MOUNTAIN PARALLEL WITH THE BOARD AND NOW ONCE YOU DETERMINE THE WAY ONE ARRIVES TO INSERT A HARDWARE ARE ALSO
BUT THIS IS REALLY GOOD PRACTICE RIGHT HERE BECAUSE NOW WE'RE GOING TO KICK THE BALL
SO WE'RE BACK TO IDENTIFYING OUR ANGLE INTO THE CUSHION AN OUT ONCE AGAIN TO HIT THIS BALL
AGAIN OPEN UP INSIDE ARM IS OPEN THE BALL GETTING GOING EUGENIC COVER THE BALL WITH BOTH HANDS AND HOLD ONTO IT TIGHT STAIN LOW IT OR TO EXPLODE THROUGH THE HOLE
ONCE THE BALL GOES INSIDE HE WANTS TO WRAP THE BALL UP TIGHT COVER IT WITH BOTH TIPS OVER THE BALL
IF YOU PUT THAT TOGETHER I GUARANTEE YOU ARE GOING TO HOOK THE BALL
AND FROM BALL IF YOU SEE YOU FIND SMALLER TINY DOORS
BUT THE MAIN THING IS YOU WANT A READER DEFENDER BIGGER OUT WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO SHOOT THE BALL AFTER CATCHING IT AND GET IT READY
OF OTHER THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THREE OR FOUR BALL ETC EARLIER DRIPPING THE FOOTBALL WHATEVER IS COMFORTABLE TO YOU AS LONG AS YOU GET A NICE FEEL AND SPIRAL
WE THROW THE BALL YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE A BASEBALL LIKE THIS
HAVE THE BALL HERE ANOTHER COOKERS LEASES POSSIBLE MEANING DON'T TAKE THE BALL HERE IN A JOB DOWN HERE TO THROW IT
HAVE THE BALL HERE YOU'LL QUICK RELEASE
TWO HANDS ON THE BALL AND YOU LOOK AT THE BALL IDEALLY OUT OF RUNNER SHOULDER
THE ONE A CARE THE BALL DOWN HERE AND WHAT THAT DOES HIS CAUSE IT UP SO RELEASE
SO UP WHEN YOU DO THAT WE RAISE THE BALL A LITTLE BIT MAKES AN TEST CUTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE THE JOINTS ARE ARE COMPLETELY SEATED DOWN HERE AT THE BOTTOM AND COMPLETELY SEATED HERE
THAT MEANS THAT THE PITCHER'S ON ACTUALLY IT FROM THE BALL AND HIT THE BATTER
THIS IS WHEN THE PITCHER OF THROWS THE BALL WILDLY OUT OF THE CATCHER'S RAIN
THE FIRST OF ALL WHEN THE SHOT GOES UP ORGANIC NOT LOOK AT THE BALL OVER TO FIND OUR MAIN
SO IT MIGHT SEEM OR TO SERVE THE BALL AND WE GET AN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE QUARTZ WE GET IN THE SQUARE IN THE ON THE GROUND WE GET A POINT
AM WITH WHEN USING THIS TYPE OF SCORING AND THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A POINT IS WHEN YOU SERVE THE BALL
THE ONLY WAY IN TRADITIONAL INSIDE OUT SCORING EVEN GET A POINT IS IF YOU SERVE THE BALL
AND ALL YOU GOT A PLASTIC CAP HERE THAT DIVIDE THE COVERED AND SHE'LL FOR THE NUT OR BALL IF THAT'S FOR USE A SMALL SCREWDRIVER JUST TO GET BEHIND IT AND PRY THAT CAP OUT
IN A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST A BALL TOSS AND DOWN AND AFTER AND THAT WORKS
TENNIS RACKET F IS DON'T GO ALONG WITH YOUR TENNIS BALL SO YOU CAN HIT THE CAN GET THE BALL BACK AND FORTH
NOW THE NET MINUTE THE REST OF THINGS YOU NEED A I'M ARE HOW I'VE NOT QUITE AS ESSENTIAL AS A TENNIS BALL AND TENNIS RACKET
NOW WHEN YOU FIRST AID IN THE BALL OUT IF YOU WANNA YOU DEFINITELY ONE OF THE CROSS THE HALF COURT LINE BEFORE EIGHT TO TEN SECONDS
USE THE TEN SECONDS AND MY DAY WHEN OTTLEY FLUFF OF SEEING WHERE THEY COUNTED THEY'VE CANDIDATE SO YOU WON'T GET THAT IN MIND WHENEVER YOU PLAY A BALL THAT YOU GET A CAUSE THE HALF COURT LINE AND YOU CAN NEVER CAN NEVER PASS IT BACK ACROSS THAT THAT WAS MOTIONS CROSSOVER INTO THE OFF IT'S OF THE DIFFERENT CORE
BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THAT WINDOWS THAT WAS ONE BALL AND WOULDN'T CALL THIS THE ONE BALL ARE
SO GET RID OF US INVOLVEMENT AGAIN WE STILL DOES NEED ONE BALL TO GET THIS GOING
REALLY YOU CAN INCORPORATE IT INTO A BALL PATTERN THAT YOU CAN BALANCE ANYTHING YOU WANT ON
SEE WINOKUR ISN'T MUCH FLUFF IT'S BEEF ON FOR THOSE HIGH IN FAT FLAVORS AND OF TROUBLE GET THE BALL IN THE AIR ON
THIS IS A A SPEED BALL IN THERE
IF YOU WERE EFFECT THE DIFFERENT PARAMETERS AND CHANGE THE RESIZE THAN THE PLUG AND IF YOU HAVE THE CLICK ON THE PLUG IN ON BALL IN WITHIN THIS OF CONTROL PANEL BLACK WE WANNA BYPASSING WILL MIX THE THE EDIT BYPASS PLANT FIRST
CONNECT THEM AS WELL AS LONG AS IT'S HITTING A BALL IF YOU PREFER
NOW WHEN YOU GO ON THE BALL BECAUSE THEY AND YOUR KNEES AND IS BASICALLY BEND FALL LEARN TO ALWAYS THINKING OF ALLOWING SHINING THROUGH THE CROWN OF THE
SO PLEASE IF YOU HAVEN'T TRIED IS MOVING DOES HAPPEN TO FIND IT FLAT ON MINE I WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST THAT YOU CHECK OUT THE OTHER CLIPS ON ARM EXTENSIONS FULL REMIX THINGS IS ON THE BALL TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU MASTER THE MOVES PROPERTY
I FIND FROM MIGHT SPRING INSIDE THE DEEPEN AND OUR POWER BALL ARE ALONG WITH SOME THAT'S FROM ALL WATER AREN'T MUCH LIKE DRINKS TIME HE GOT GET YOU READY FOR FOR MINOR ON DISTANCE
AND THIS BALL IT DOESN'T TAKE THAT POTTER'S KNIFE IN OF MAKE IT REALLY IS A DRY DOWN A SCRIPT AWFUL THE MOVE WITH OF ON THE <UNK> CLAY
AGAIN KEEP YOUR HAND ON TOP OF IT IT IN A PULL THE BALL BACK
SO AS YOU GET A SINK AND THESE GUYS ARE GOTTA BE DRIBBLING HEART INTO THE DEFENDER IT WANTS A FILL LIGHT THAT THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE DRIBBLE ANYMORE WHAT THEIR GET A DO AS THEY GET A DRIBBLE IT AND THE PULL THE BALL BACK
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP THAT SHIELD UP AZURE PULL ON THE BALL BACK BECAUSE IF NOT YOU PULL THE BALL BACK YOU LEAVE YOURSELF OPENING EXPOSE THE DEFENDER ALL HAS DO STEP THROUGH TAKE THAT BALL IS GETTING GO DOWN THE OTHER END AND SCORE
WHEN YOU DO YOU DRIBBLE YOU KEEP THE BALL AND CLOSE TO THE INNER GUINNESS SILLIER DEFENDER AWAY AND KEEP YOUR SHIELD UP
IN THE WAY THAT YOU USE THIS DRIBBLE IS IF YOU'RE DRIBBLING DOWN THE FLOOR AND YOUR DEFENDER IS CLOSING TIGHT ON YOU AND YOU DON'T GO COMPARABLE TO CONTINUE FORWARD WHAT YOU CAN DO IS YOU CAN PULL THE BALL BACK AND GET AWAY FROM YOUR DEFENDER
IF YOU WANTED TO CUT THE BALL TO THE LEFT AND A CUTTER FASTBALL YOU POSITION FINGERS ON TO THE LEFT HALF A BALL TO CREATE SPAN AND MOVEMENT THAT WOULD MAKE THE BALL BASICALLY CURVE TO THE RIGHT
IF YOU WANT A CUT THE BALL TO THE RIGHT IN YOUR RIDING A PITCHER YOU CUT THE BALL IN HALF AND POSITION BOTH FINGERS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF A BALL
THE CUTTER A IS ACCOMPLISHED THAT EITHER CUTTING THE BALL TO THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT
LOOK PRESSURE ON THE BALL THE FOOT
HITTING DRILLS YOU WILL HAVE A SETTER WHO WILL SET THE BALL TO THE HEADER
WHEN PASSING THE BALL YOU ONE HIT IT BETWEEN YOUR WRISTS AND YOUR ELBOW
SO THE TOSS OR WOOD TOSS THE BALL TO THE PASSER FASTER ONCE YOU GET BEHIND THE BALL FACE THE TARGET USE THE KNEES GET THERE BUT DOWN
SO I'M RIGHT HANDED OMINOUS THAT FIRST WITH MY RIGHT FOOT THAT THEY GET TO STEP APPROACH RIGHT LEFT AND DOWN PUT MY HANDS BEHIND THE PALMS FACING UP AND IN ONE THUMB DOWN BRING MY HANDS UP TO BRING THAT KNEE UP HIGHER ABOVE THE GROUND AND THEN ON THAT AND DROP MY ELBOW LEAD WITH MY LEFT ARM AND SWING THROUGH THE BALL
SO AS THE LEAD BALL CHEST PASS AND NOW THE MOVE ON TO SOME GRIP EXERCISES
GET A GOOD AND ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS EXERCISE IS ACTUALLY CAUSING YOUR YOUR INNER THIGHS TO CONTRACT AGAINST THE MEDICINE BALL WHICH IS GONNA ADD AN EXTRA CHALLENGE AND IF A LITTLE BIT DEEPER IN YOUR ABDOMINALS
OUR NEXT CLIP OF ITS KENNEDY STABILIZATION CRUNCHES WITH MEDICINE BALL
NOW THE HAVE A PROBLEM HOLDING ON THIS BALL YOU CAN ALWAYS CROSS WRINKLES PACKET AND TRYING TO JUST FOR THIS HERE FEET'S HOLD THE MEDICINE BALL
IF PUSHING IT DOWN NICE AND GENTLY ON THE MOUTH PULL DOWN NICE AND SLOW HALF OR TAKE YOUR MEDICINE BALL IN AND PLACE IT BETWEEN THE ICE WE KEEP YOUR FEET AT NINETY DEGREES
EVERY MEDICINE BALL THE PANTS
THIS LITTLE ENERGY BALL IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT
CLICK ITSELF INTO A TREE OR ALL THE OR SOMETHING SOLID SO THAT YOU CAN USE IT AS A BELAY POINT OF THE SHOW AND THAT WAY NO MATTER HOW MUCH TENSIONS ON THAT WROTE YOU GOTTA BE ABLE TO LEAN AGAINST THE BALL WILL THE CHERRY USING THAT LIP LINE AND IS NOT GONNA GO ANYWHERE
I'M RYAN MCCANN REFUND BY HOW TO THROW THE BALL LIKE PRO
NOW WHEN WE'RE THROWING ARE BALL UP WITH ONE HAND AND TOSS WE WERE JUST GOING UP IN THE AIR
THINGS ON THE BALL COMES UP WORDS MOVE IT THERE BRISTLES CANTED THAT CAN BE CALLED AS AN OFF SIDES
THE DEADLY CANNOT LIFT THE BALL UP AT ANY POINT TIME
THIS GUY'S DRIBBLE AND HITS THE BALL TO THE MIDDLE YOU NOW SEE THIS GUY COMMON PASSES HERE
ADDING SWEETEN SOUND EFFECTS MOVE ACROSS OR STARING MIDGE HAVING THINGS MOVE UP AND DOWN EVEN ON AND IT'S ALL HIS SONG BALL
NEVER IN A DROP THE BALL SLIGHTLY BEEN ON HAND TO ABOUT NINETY DEGREES AND EXTEND UP
BALL COMES OFF THE RIM ITS POSITION FIRST CONTRACT FORCE TO MAKE SURE IT FEEL THE OTHER GUY FORCE AND THEN YOU GO FOR THE BALL
SELF YOU WANT TO ATTACK THE BALL WHICH IS WHAT YOU DO DURING A PASSING PATTERN YOU ATTACK THE BALL AND GET INTO POSSESSION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
NOW AS YOU GET A LITTLE BIT MORE SOPHISTICATED WITH IT YOU AGGRESSIVELY TO CATCH THE BALL OUT OF THE AIR
THROW THE BALL UP
NOW YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BODY AROUND IN CURSES UP OF OVER HERE AND BRYAN'S JUST DOING IS WORKOUT FOOT DRYING CAN DO AND I JUST CALLED THE LONELY BORE WORKOUT IS JUST THROW THE BALL UP YOURSELF AND WORK ON CATCHING JUST WORK ON A CATCHING TECHNIQUE
AND THIS WILL BE THE TRUE STAYING THAT HE CAN DO FROM SELF IS TO KEEP HIS ARMS PUMPING JUST LIKE YOU WOULD BURN RUNNING ROUTE AND GET THE BALL WITH RIGHT IN DUES RIGHT INTO THE WINDOW
NOW BRIDE GETS MORE COMFORTABLE WE CAN THROW THE BALL OUT ANY LATER RUNNING AND THEM BREAK DOWN AND CATCH THE BALL
USUALLY IN AN EVEN IF THE IN THE BALL IS THIS IS LYING THESE
TAKE THE STRAP AROUND THE BALL FOR AN LAY RIGHT DOWN
WE CAN DO A MEDICINE BALL AND AWAY AT ALL
YOU CAN TO THE BALL OF THE FOOT OR THE INSIDE OF FOOT
WHAT IS A BALL OFF
NUMBER FOR THE BALL FURTHER BACK IN YOU STANCE
SO THE PROBLEM WITH HITTING OFF OF THIS IF YOU CAN'T GET THE CLUB UNDERNEATH THE BALL IT YOU CAN IN GRASS OR SAND OR EVEN LOOSE IMPEDIMENTS
SO YOU LINE UP A I CUTE A NORMAL SHOT BUT I WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE AND SUPER RELAX BECAUSE UKE IF YOU TRY TO MUSCLE THIS BALL WHAT HAPPENS IS OFF HARD PAN THE CLUB HITS THE HARD PAN AND THEN SKIPS IN THE BACK OF A BALL PRODUCING A SKULL SHOT
THEY NOW I'M READY TO TAKE THE CLUB BACK PROPERLY AND PUT PROPER POWER OF FROM THE BODY INTO HITTING THE BALL
IAN AND YOU HAVE BEEN THE SKIN AND IN THAT YOU JUST HAVE THEM INTO THE AND WHEN YOU PUT THE BALL WHEN YOU'RE IN A CERTAIN POSITION AND YOU PUT THEM ALL OF THEIR OFF OF THE GLASS IT'S KINDA OF THEM COME IN AND BOUNCE INTO THE ON TO THE RIM NOW AND THERE'S MANY <UNK>
THE BALL IS THROWN WITHIN HIS OWN OF CATCHING ABILITY BUT IT SOMEHOW GOT PAST <UNK>
NOW PASSED BALL IS VERY SIMILAR TO A WILD FISH
THAT MEANS THAT THE CATCHER SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT THE BALL BUT DID
SO BASICALLY WHAT IT IS IS IT'S TWO PLAYERS WHO TURN THEIR STICK SO I WITH THE BACKS TOWARDS EACH OTHER WITH THE BOND THE MIDDLE AND YOU HAVE BOTH HUMANS ON THE STICK AND DO IT UP THE BALL AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GET UP UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND FLING ABOVE ABOVE YOUR HEAD AND THEN ALL THE THAT TEAMMATES CANNOT MOVE INTO TRY TO GET THE BALL AND GRAB POSSESSION
SO THE REFEREE WILL PLACE THE BALL I AT WITH IN THE BACK HERE STICK AND USE THAT IN YOU WAIT FOR THE WITH A LITTLE RIDGES CAN ACCOUNTANT THE CAKE
AND SO TO WIN A DRAW SHOT YOU ONE OF MAKE SURE THE CHURCH THIRTY A PITCHER LANKA'S ARE ON PLANTED SHOULD OF FIRMLY AND IF YOU HAVE A GOOD GRIP ON YOUR STICK AND THE WAY WHEN IT IS GET UNDERNEATH THE BALL REALLY QUICK IN AND HIT UP
HEALTH LEAVE A LITTLE BIT FOR THAT I CAN GIVE IS BALL MOINES THEM AND THEN I'LL TAKE MY RIGHT HAND AND PUSHED WORDS MALATHION ENOUGH IN AND THEN DOWN USING THE HEEL OF MY LEFT HAND HEAT THAT CLAY FROM FISHING HOW VERY FAR
FIRST YOU WANT IT TAKE YOUR BALL OF CLAY AND WENT TO THE AS ROUNDS POSSIBLE THAT MAKES ENTERING MUCH EASIER TO AND THAT IT DOWN PRETTY HARD LIGHT ON THINNER THE WHEEL
THE OVERHEAD PASS IS AFFECTIVE DURING THE GAME AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF SPACE BETWEEN YOU AND PERSON INTO CHINA PASS IT TO AND YOU ACTUALLY GET A VEIL WITH SOME SET SO THAT THE BEEF IT'S DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO GET IN BETWEEN A TROT STEAL THE BALL
BUT IF THE BALL IS IN THE AIR AND YOU HIT IT THAT'S A VOLLEY
ALL OF OLLIE IS JUST TAKING THE BALL BEFORE TONE SAYS SO OBVIOUSLY THE BALL BOUNCES LIKE THIS THAT'S A GROUND STROKE
WHEN I BRING THE EYES BACK TO THE BALL I GO AHEAD AND HIT IT
I HAVE MY BALL JOINT PICKLE FORK
AND OF COURSE A BALL JOINT PRESS WHICH IS WHAT REALLY USE TO CHANGE THIS GUY
IF YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A PARTICULAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LOWER BALL JOINT CALF AND THE UPPER BALL JOINT CONTROL ARM ASSEMBLED
THE CONTROL ARM ASSEMBLY HAVE THE BALL JOINT ARTIE PRESS IN
IT MAY TAKE FIFTY TO GET YOU TRY TO JOIN TOES TOGETHER A BALL WHIP HEEL FOR
SO LET'S HAVE A THREE BALL ON THE BODY'S REFORMER
YOU DON'T NEED WHEN THE BALL AND YOU PROBABLY HAVE YOUR OWN SPIN ON EACH INDIVIDUAL TRICK
NOW THE CLUB JUGGLING TRICKS ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM BALL JUGGLING TRICKS
THE SET MY TOOL DOWN GRAB MY NEW BALL JOINT AND SHOW YOU THE TAPE AROUND
GETTING CAUGHT IN THE BALL IS THE DOWNSIDE OF LOVE
IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS WE'RE AND TALK ABOUT THE CORRECT PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZE VEHICLE
SHE YOU GET OUT OF THIS BRING THE WEIGHTS DOWN DROP THE HIPS LIFT THE HEAD AND WALK YOURSELF BACK UP ON THE BALL
SO WHEN WE ARE DOING THIS MOTION OF EXPANDING OUTWARD WE HAVE THE ALSO BE THINKING WE'RE EXPANDING DOWN WE'RE EXPANDING BACK WE'RE STANDING UP IT'S LIKE A BALL OR I LIKE THAT SEE IT IS A SUN EXPLODING OUTWARD
IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT LAWYER CLEANING IT AND PULLING OUT SOME OF THE FIND A BRAIDING ON OF MISREADING LOESER YOU MAY NOTICE THAT'S THEM INTO LITTLE PIECES BALL DOWN BELOW
AND WHAT YOU WANT A LOB IT UP IN GIVE THE PLAYER ENOUGH TIME TO CATCH THE BALL AND THE LIVER INTO THE BASKET WITH FEROCITY
SO A LOT ONCE AGAIN IS TAKEN THE BALL FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
IT'S A WAY OF AVOIDING LIGHT TROUBLES AIRWAY IT ALSO GETTING THE BALL OF IF THE GREEN IS HEAVILY BUNKER DEPENDS ON THE LEFT SIDE IS THE WAVE TRACKING THE BALL TO FOR THE HEAD
SO IF YOU GET EASIER LEISURE TO HOOK THE BALL
SO YOU GET THE NORMAL UNDERSPIN OF STRIKING THE BALL WITH A CLOSE THE FACE LIKE THIS TO CREATE SOME SIDES AS THE BALL WILL SPIN AND GO TO THE LEFT
SO WOULDN'T NOTE IS THIS IS HOW YOU LINE UP FOR THE NORMAL STRAIGHT BALL
SO IF MY HANDS DON'T HIT THE BALL THE EXACT SAME TIME IF AN ILLEGAL HAT
SO SETTING DRILLS EVEN HAVE A TALL CERTAIN WILL TOSSING THE BALL AND YOU GET UNDER IT USUALLY LEGS THEY SHOULD TARGET AND ONE OF PUSH THE BALL OUT WITH THEIR LIGHT NOT ONLY ARE REST BUT YOUR LEGS ALSO AND FACIAL TARGET AND TIDY GIVEN THE TARGET
SO WHEN YOU'RE SETTING THE BALL AND TAKE THE BALL AND SHAPE YOUR HANDS IN THE SHAPE OF A BALL
CAN FIX YOUR HANDS TO FIRMLY ON THE MEDICINE BALL
YOU USE ENGLISH TO CONTROL THE ANGLES THAT EIGHT BALL COMES OFF OF A CUSHION NOT THE ANGLES AND IT COMES OFF OF ONE OF THE BALL
BUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR THIS TIME IS WHAT ANGLED IS THE CUE BALL COME OFF OF THE CUSHION
OKAY IN THE LAST SEGMENT WE LEARNED THAT USING ENGLISH DOES NOT HELPLESS CONTROL THE DIRECTION THAT A CUE BALL COMES OFF OF AN OBJECT BALL AT AN ANGLE
TAMERS GET HIT THE BALL SOFTLY DID THERE AND HE'S GETTING IT SOFTLY BACK TO ME
THIS WILL TEACH YOU HOW TO KEEP THE BALL IN PLAY AND THE PITCHER TARGETS
SO IF I'M THROWING A THREE BALL PATTERN YOU CHOSE A THREE OR SEA AVERAGES FOR
NOW WHEN YOU JUGGLE OF THREE BALL PATTERN AT JUST THREE THREE THREE CONTINUING
THE EACH THROW IS A THREE BALL HEIGHT AND THAT IS CROSS LIKE THIS
ANY LITTLE BITS OF FLAKE THIS LITTLE BALL FIST FULL THAT OFF IT LIKE THAT <UNK>
IF NEMATODES A SOCCER BALL SOCCER BALL HE'S BE SIXTY EIGHT THIS SEVENTY CENTIMETERS AND DIAMETER AND WILL HAVE A BELT FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN THE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY GRAMS OF WEIGHT IN IT AND IT REALLY DOESN'T WAY TOO MUCH
OKAY SO FIRS WHEN THEY GO AHEAD AND TAKE OFF OF THE BALL RIGHT HERE WE GO AHEAD AND TAKE LOOSEN THIS BUT WE'RE NOT AND TAKE OUT THE CLAMP ALL THE WAY CAUSE WE ARE GENERALLY USE IT
THERE MAY BE TIMES WHEN YOU WANT THE BALL IN BELLY AND SWIM IF PLEASANTLY TO SHORE AS WELL
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS YOU HAVE TO GO GET THE BALL
IF THE BALL GOES OUT THE RIGHT SIDE YOU CAN ATTACK THE RIGHT SIDE
THAT IS THE PROPER WAY TO SEE WHO PICKLE FORK AND BREAK THE MECHANICAL WELD BETWEEN THE SPINDLE AND THE BALL TO
RIGHT THERE THE MECHANICAL WELD HAS BEEN BROKEN AS YOU CAN SEE OUR UPPER BALL JOINT IS NOW FREE AND WE'RE READY TO CONTINUE WITH THE REST OF THAT IS SANDWICH PROCEDURE
RAISED UP BRING THE BOUGHT A NOW BAHIA OTTLEY IS THE BALL
WHY ABOUT WHEN YOU ARE ABOUT THESE DISTANCE YOU LOSE THE BALLS OF THE BALL GOES
YOU WILL WANT TO START THE SOFA HE WAY IF THE BALL ON THE NEXT IS THIS I HAVE IT
CROSS OVER THE BALL SEE OR GRABBING WITH YOUR ANKLE
HE SHOULD FEEL THE CALF AND YOUR ANKLE ON THE BACK OF THE BALL
IN LEFT LEG IS GOING TO COME UP PAINT SO IT'S AROUND THE BALL AND HOOK THE POLE WITH THE TOP OF YOUR FLAT
AND THEY JUST LET IT GROW INTO A BOWL BLITZ IN THAT GROWS INTO A BALL FROM ONE LITTLE SELL
BECAUSE IT'S THE CLUB HEAD THAT HITS THE BALL IN THE BALL KNOWS ALL IN THE ONLY THING THE BALL KNOWS IS IMPACT AND OUT AND WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT BUT IF YOU CAN WATCH THE CLUB HEAD AT HOME IN PRACTICE WINGS IN YOUR BACKYARD
THE REASON YOU WOULDN'T CLAP IS THE VISION WINDOW HOW HIGH THE TOSS THE BALL OUT TO GIVE YOU ENOUGH TIME TO CATCH IT
ONCE YOU REACH TWELVE EITHER FROM STARTING WITH A NATURAL ONE OR WITH A SKIP BALL ON THEN THE CARD OF PILE IS TAKEN AWAY AND THERE'S A NEW SLOT OPEN TO START A NEW STOCK PILE
THIS COCKTAIL IS CALLED THE BALL OR EYE AREA
AT ANY ALSO PROBABLY ONE OF HAVE A COOL BALL OF COOL WATER NEXT TO IT JUST IN HIS ONE IN COOL THE STONES OFF MORE RAPIDLY
THROW THROW THROW THROW THIS ARE THREE BALL CASCADE PAT
WE ADD THE THIRD BALL AND PAT IT WILL JUST BE SOLID THROWS
THE BALL DOWN FIGHT POINT ZERO FIVE POINT FIVE INSTANCE
SO THIS IS A TOUGH LIGHT BECAUSE YET TO GET YOU DO HAVE TO TRY TO GET UNDERNEATH THE BALL A LITTLE BIT TO GET IT OFF
SAUT RITUAL OR HOW TO DO HERE IS TO PICK THE BALL CLEANLY OFF THIS OF SERVICE HAS IT IS ALMOST LIKE GETTING OFF OF CONCRETE
SO WHEN YOU GET A DANDELION FAIRWAY SANTA SAY OKAY JUST TAKE A AN APPROPRIATE CLUB AND HIS PICKS THE BALL OUT OF THERE SO YOU HAVE THE SWING ANOTHER DAY
OR IF YOU'RE TOO CLOSE TO THIS LET IF THIS CAN BE VERY HARD FOR ME IT ALONG HIGHER OUT OF HERE IS MY HEAD AT THE BALL TO GO INTO THIS INTO THE LIP HERE
AND COME IN WITH I'D BALANCING BALL
WE'RE GOING TO GET A SCOOT OR A BALL OF ACRYLIC POWDER OUT AND APPLY TO THE NOW
I NOW HAVE A SHOT ON THE EIGHT BALL
A DRAW SHOT AGAIN IS ONE WERE ON THE MARKET THAT BALL IN ON ONE MAKE THE CUE BALL COME BACK TOWARDS ME
NOT INEXPENSIVE DEREK LEADS I DON'T NEED A FANCY JERSEY JUST THE BALL AND THE ABILITY TO HAVE A GOOD TIME
SO WORK ON THAT AND YOU HAVE A GOOD FOUR BALL STAR
YOU CAN DO A STEADY ONE FINGER PRESSURE TO STAYING IN THAT PLACE WORT YOU CAN DO CIRCULAR MOTION WITH YOUR THUMB WORT WITH THE BALL OF YOUR FINGER
AND THE OUTSIDE OPPOSITE SIDE AS WELL THE B OF EVEN THE ANY PART OF THE STICK RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE BALL IS GOING TO BE INSIDE AGAINST THE MILK CARTON SO YOU REALLY WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT'S EVEN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING THE STICK DIRTY WHILE YOU'RE PAINTING IT
THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOING TO BE SEEN ON THE OUTSIDE IS BASICALLY BEING THE BALL ITSELF
ON THE TOP PART IS GOING TO BE A BEAD PLACED ON IT SO THAT IN THE BALL WILL SIT SECURELY IN ONE FULL OF THE STICK
SO IT'S ALSO EASY TO PAINT IT WHILE IT'S ON AND ON THE STATE BECAUSE A BALL IS HARD TO GRIP WALL WALL PAINTING IT SO ON THIS LEG USES WAY TO HOLD ON TO THE BALL AND GET ALL SIDES UNDERNEATH AND ON TOP ALL AROUND THE BALL VERY EASILY WHILE IT'S ON THE STICK
NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PAINT THE STYROFOAM BALL BEING THAT THE STYROFOAM BALL IS GOING TO BE SITTING AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH IT'S GOING TO BE THE CENTER OF THE WINDMILL WE'RE ALL ALL THE ARMS ARE GOING TO BE HANGING
ONCE YOU HAVE A CONFIDENT FOUR BALL SHOWER PATTERN DOWN YOU CAN LEARN TRICKS WITHIN IT IN VARIOUS VARIATIONS
AND THAT'S ABOUT GETTING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SHOOTING THE WRIST OR FRESHER COURSE GOES OFFICE IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE BALL AND BACK
WE WANT OUR RIGHT HAND IT'S ON THE PLACE MY HAND BEHIND THE BALL A SUCH INTO THE GROOVE
THE SAME RESTAURANTS WE GO TO THE SAME MOVIES WE SEE THE SAME FRIENDS AND IT GETS TO BE BALL RAINING
ANOTHER THING IN HUNTER NEWS IS TO TELL THE MUNTEAN IF BALL UP DOWN MOTION WE CALL THE AMTRAK THROUGH WHICH MISO CYCLE MOTION
SO AGAIN TO US IF IF IS THE RACKET IS PUSHES THE BALL RIGHT ABOVE THE TIN
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS REALLY BE CONSCIOUS OF KEEPING THE BALL LOW SO YOU DON'T WANT THE HIGH THROWS THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO CATCH
KEEP IT LOW IN REALLY CONSCIENCE CONSCIOUS OF THE BALL TRAVELING PASTOR YEAR AND DROPPING RIGHT BEHIND YOUR SHOULDER AND FIFTY KICK A SHOULDER OUT A LITTLE BIT FORWARD TO GET YOUR ARM BACK AND THAT'S OKAY
SQUEEZE YOUR LEGS TOGETHER SQUEEZING KNEES TOGETHER AS A YOU TRY AND SQUEEZE A TIGHT BALL SQUEEZE TIGHT FOR ABOUT FIVE SECONDS RELAX AND TRY IT AGAIN FURTHER
SO THAT'S HOW YOU PLAY ON A LONGER IYER WHEN THE BALL IS ABOVE YOUR FEET
OUR ENERGY THE BALL AND I WROTE THE ARTICLE AND HOW THE FINANCES VERY IN AN EYE IS A NEW USE
ASHLEY LEAD WITH AN IN IS THAT IF THE BALL AT HOME
OKAY ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT TOOL THAT A BIT UNIQUE WELL IT'S CAN HARFORD INDIVIDUAL TO BUY A TOOL IT IS WHAT THIS IS ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT WE USE A HOW WHEN WE RE CARE EQUALLY WELL IS WHAT'S CALLED A BALL PRESS
AGAIN I MIGHT NEED TO FIND SOMETHING LIKE A BALL OR SOMETHING TO REALLY ENJOYS IT'LL WORK WITH TWO SO OF CHEESE WITH THIS TOY AND SHE'S HADN'T WAY FOR ME I'M GOING TO GO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WITH YET ANOTHER SQUEAKY TOY
I LOVE THE BALL YOU PROBABLY SEEN THESE IN THE GYMS ALL OVER THE PLACE
BUT FOR NOW BE USING A BALL THAT HOME CUTTING METHOD
SO NOW I HAVE A FOUR POUND BALL
IF YOU'RE CARES ABOUT WHY TELL THEM THAT LIVE EDGES FEEL FREE TO RATS AROUND AND OF FOR THE WOOD SHOP WE'RE SITTING ON THE BALL OR STANDING IN HOW TO FIND OUT THE DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF THE MOVES THAT YOU CAN BE A OUT <UNK> BOARD THAT BACK IN NOW
THE WHICH OUT WITH THE MEDICINE BALL ONCES OF VARIATION OF THE WOOD TOP MOVE ON
IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS WRITTEN TALK ABOUT THE CORRECT PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZE VEHICLE
AND WE ARE GOING TO LOOK BEHIND YOU THINK OF BEING A PULL THAT LEANING ON YOUR OIL IN THAT OF THE BALL THAT YOUR FEET
IT YOUR SCARECROW IS STOCK AND WITH THE OTHER CORRECTLY HE JUST IN A SET OUT ON A SOUND AND IT COULD BE GREAT OR OUTSIDE FOR THE BALL SEASON
AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN DO ALL THE FUNDAMENTAL THINGS RIGHT YOU CAN COME UP THE SCREEN YOU CAN BE OPEN PER SECOND YOU CAN CATCH THE BALL YOU CAN GET READY TO SHOOT POCKET YOU CAN BE READY TO DELIVER THE SHOT WHICH YOU HAVE A GOOD DEFENDER ON IT IT'S GONNA COME OUT PLAY DEFENSE ON IT AND THAT MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT TIME TO TAKE THE SHOT
SOMETIMES YOU DEFENDER'S GOING AND CATCH THE BALL SOMETIMES OR DEFENDERS AGAIN A LIE BACK ON IT AND KEEP THEIR HANDS THEM
SOMETIMES THE PIN IS AGAIN A CLOSE RIGHT OUT ON YOU AND I HAVE A HANDLE THE BALL IN YOUR <UNK> TO GET A SHOT AWAY
YOUR PICTURE YOU WANT THE BALL THE SANKYO WANT THE SAIL YOU WANT THE DOG YOU WANT TO DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS MIX IT UP OR FOR THE BATTER TO HIT
HERE'S THE PROPER GRIP NEW FOR THE BALL FROM TUCKED UNDER IF IN OR THE BAY WHEN YOU THROW THE BALL AND IT COMES OUT YOUR FINGERS YOU HAVE FOUR SEAMS BREAKING THE AIR IT WAS TEND TO STAY STRAIGHT OR IF YOU THROUGH THE BALL THIS WAY WHERE THE SEAMS MAY MAKE IT SINK
AND I'M TABLETS COME IN A LITTLE BOTTLE WITH LITTLE COTTON BALL A TOP AND YOU JUST PULL IN THE TAB WITH A MENU WITH A HALF AN HOUR WHENEVER IT SAYS IN THE BOTTLE AND THEN THE WATER IS THIS WITH INTRIGUING TAKES CARE OF ALL THE STUFF IT'S AND WATER
THAT'S A LIVE AN ODD BALL PLAY
RAMP AND THE FIRST STRING ON RIP AND THE BALL AND THE STRING AND PUT THAT RIGHT HERE IN THE SLOT ON THE TAIL PIECE
I HAVE IS THESE THREE GUYS BRING THE BALL THERE IS SO THEY BRING THE BALL DOWN THE FIRST TWO GUYS OFF THE SIDELINE COME IN AND ESTABLISH THE DEFENSIVE POSITION
HE CAN TEACH THEM THESE TACTICS GO OVER ROLE PLAYING EXERCISES AGAIN WHEN YOU FIND I'M SAYING SOMETHING PERHAPS INAPPROPRIATE ON THE BALL OR NOT VERY PROFESSIONAL JUST POINT OUT
YOU HAVE THAT RIGHTS IN NO WAY TO THE A AT THE TABLE YOU WANT ANY ANY MYSTERIES OR ANY AN ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU WANNA GET OF ALL OUR THAT YOU CAN HEAR THAT EXACT EXACT FIGURE THE INSHORE GIVE YOU A BALL OR THE EAR ESTIMATED SELLERS PROCEEDS ARE IMPORTANT
SO THE OBJECTIVE ON THE BRAKE IS TO OF COURSE POCKET AT LEAST ONE BALL WHICH IS THEN GOING TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY AT THE TABLE AND THEN TRY TO POCKET MORE BALLS
THEY CAN ALSO ADD SHADOWING TO THE BALL OF YARN
SO YOU NEVER LEAD WITH THE HAND YOU ALWAYS LEAVE WITH YOUR ELBOW IT'LL HELP YOU TO GET THE BALL STRAIGHT OVER THE NET TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE SERVE
WHEN YOU CONTACT THE BALL YOU WANT TO HIT IT ALMOST TO THE HEEL OF YOUR PALM AND IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR HAND
SO WHEN YOU TOSS THE BALL EVEN ON TAKING ELBOW BACK AND WHEN YOU HIT IN LEAD WITH THE ELBOW
WHEN YOU KEEPING AN OPENING IT MORE SURFACE AREA ON THE BALL WHICH CAN HELP YOU TO GUIDE THE BALL TO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE COURT
SO WHEN YOU'RE SERVING VOLUME WARRIOR HAND OUT IN FRONT OF YOU WHO ARE TOSS THE BALL UP IN FRONT OF YOU SEE THAT THIS THAT AND HIT IT WITH THEIR HAND
AND THIS IS A TYPE OF ALL THE BALL IN FRONT OF YOU HEAR THE CHANCE TO STEP INTO IT AND ATTACK THE FLAIL
YOUR CUE BALL START IN THE SAME PLACE
YOUR OBJECT BALL STARTS RIGHT IN THE CENTER THE TABLE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO KICK THE BALL IN EITHER ONE OF THESE TWO POCKETS FROM THAT SET
AND THIS ONE I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR WOBBLE DOES THIS BALL ONE STILL HAS BUBBLES THAT THERE ARE BUBBLING UP CONSTANTLY
IT REALLY GIVE YOU A LOT MORE OPPORTUNITY TO WHERE THE KIND BALL GAMAGE IF I
THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT PRACTICE THE SHOTS BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BUILD A KNOW HOW MUCH A BALL HAWKS WHEN YOU SWING ON THE PRACTICE RATED FOR IT TO DO IT ON THE GOLF COURSE
TO BEGIN WITH THE STABILITY ON THE BOW SERUM WHAT YOU WANT TO DO HAS YOU WANNA TURNED UPSIDE DOWN AND YOU'RE IN A BRING THE BLACK SIDE TO THE TOP AND THE BALL PART IS IN A V ON THE BOTTOM AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IS ON AND PUT MY FEET ON HERE TAKES A LITTLE BIT AKKADIAN MIGHT BE A LITTLE NERVOUS BUT WHAT YOU ONE AND USE YOU AND BRING BOTH YOUR FEET ON TOP OF THE BALL LOOKS JUST LIKE THAT

SO HAPPENS IS THE BALL COMES OUT COMES OTHER HAND AND SPIRALS TO GIVE IT THE <UNK> INJECTOR E F TO TARGET IF IF THE THIGH
AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE BALL WITH THE WHITE WOLF OVAL TENSES IF GET IN AND MAKE IT LOOK FITS ONE AND FANCY
HI MY NAME'S JOE AND BREAKTIME BILLIARDS IN WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO FIGURE HOW FAR AWAY FROM BALL TO STAY IN AND ALSO HOW TO MAKE A STANCE
BECAUSE WHAT CAN HAPPEN IS THIS GUY IS THAT IT GETS THE BALL AND IS IN A DRIVE PAST IS MAY
THIS GUY RIGHT NOW HAS THE BALL TO VS TO COMMIT TO HIM YES THE GARDEN FULLY BUT AS QUICKLY AS THE BALL MOVES FROM THERE YOU HAVE MOVE AT THE TOP OF THE KEY
REASON BEING IS SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT HAVE THE BALL AND THE TEAM MIGHT FALL IN THAT YOU MIGHT STILL MAINTAIN SESSION OF THE BALL OR TO MAKE MY SETS THE BALL AND LEAVE YOURSELF A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SWIVEL
NOW SAY THAT'S THE PLAYS GOING ON THIS OF FOLLOW AND TOUCH THE BALL BUT NOT GET GOOD WITH SESSION AND GET A TEAM GETS IT INITIALLY THE OFFICIAL LIKE THAT OFF I MIGHT MATS US THAT HAS THE THINGS YOU HAVE ADVANCE
YOU TAKE AND SLIP IT BETWEEN YOUR SPINDLE AND YOUR BALL JOINT AND HAMMERED IN THE POSITION

IN THE FOLLOWING PLANTS REALLY TALK ABOUT THE CORRECT PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZE VEHICLE
IN THE FOLLOWING PLANTS REALLY TALK ABOUT THE CORRECT PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZE VEHICLE
YOU'RE NOT REACHING THE FLOOR THAT MEANS THE BALL IS TOO BIG FOR YOU'LL SO YOU OF ADJUST THE SIZE ACCORDING A OR YOU CAN DO IT RIGHT HERE
THEY LIKE FROM ALL THE GOLF BALL OUT PROPER GRIT
AGAIN BIG AND SAVANNAH AND THE BALL
OVER AND ZOOM IN TAKE MEDICINE BALL NASAL RIDGES IN A CHEST PASS IS BACK AND FORTH
THAT BALL CHEST PASS
FOR GUYS ON THOSE ARE THE BALL THEIR MOUTH PUSH STRAIGHT OUT
IF IT WAS A UP BACK PIECE KNEES KIDS DECIDE TO START THROWING A BALL INTO A COP ON
THEN ONCE YOU'VE GOT THAT YOU CAN ADD ONE MORE THROW AND SALON AND TELL YOU CAN KEEP IT GOING JUST LIKE YOU THREE BALL PATTERN
SO JUST LIFTING THE BALL IN THE AIR HOPPING IT UP AND IT FREE WHICH ALLOWS US TO THE BOUNCING AFTER THAT
SO HERE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THIS BUILD UP AS WE TAKE YOUR INSTRUMENT THROUGH HERE WE ARE IN AND GENTLY PULL SOME THIS MATERIAL OFF THE TOOTH JUST LIKE SO AND CANVAS IN A LIGHT SCRAPING MOTION WE'RE MOVING ALL THIS BALL UP AROUND THE TEETH
SOME IT TAKE FROM THE SWITCH TOOLS NOW THAT OVER THE BALL
SEE IF YOU GO OUT THERE TO GET IT WHEN HE GOES UP RAISING HEAVILY ALLOWED TO GET THAT BALL
SO MAYBE IF THE DOG LOVES UP A BALL FRO BALL OUT TO THE WATER
TO GET YOUR FAVORITE BALL
ONCE YOU GET A BOX OUT THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GO IN YOUR EXPLODE UP IT IN A FIND THE BALL A RIP IT OFF THE BACK BOARD
ALL YOU REALLY NEED IS A BALL AND FEEL THE PLANE
YOU CANNOT BOX OUT AND ALLOW THE BALL TO COME TO YOU
WE'VE NICE AND EASY AND TAKE A NICE EASY SWING AND REMEMBER USE ONE A KICK THE BALL CLEANLY OFF OF THIS WITH A MINIMAL DIVOT THIGH
I'M TO A WIDENING FINS FLUID FIVE FEET OF HIRE AN INSECT ADDITIVES SECOND TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER AND TO THE OUTER EDGES OF THE MATTER THAT THEY'RE MAKING PARALLEL LINES THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE A BALL AND CENTER OF THE HEEL
SO THIN OPPONENT HITS A THIRTY GOOD SHOT IF THESE IS THE I HIT THE BACK OF THE I'M NOT DOING LIKE A DROP SHOT AND MORE TRADITIONAL ONE I GET A RECORD OF AND IS USING THE STRENGTH IN HIS BLOCKING THE BALL SO JUST OF LIGHT ABOVE THE TEN
SO ONCE YOU CAN MAINTAIN FOR THREE ENGINE IS IN COMING OFF THE BALL OF THE CURVE IN TWO HUNDRED METERS IF YOU HAVE TO RUN A HALF TO LEARN TO ONE RELAX WHICH I MEAN WITH I MEAN BY THAT IS ONE A RELAX HELPS TO RUN FASTER
WHAT SHE ON THE HOME STRETCH AND THIS BALL A BOAT CUTS
EXCELLENT HE'S FAT IS BALL HE NOW CAN GO AHEAD AND PLAY A SECOND SHOP I AND WE'VE OF HELP SPEED UP THE PACE APPLY
AND WHAT OUR MINUTES AT ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOU THROW THE BALL
I WOULD SAY SOME LIKED WOBBLE IN THE CORNER POCKET WHICH I WOULD MAKE OF AND THEN OUT I WOULD NOT MYSELF IN A POSITION YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TRY TO PLAY POSITION IT'S ANOTHER VIDEO TAPE CLOVES WHAT TYPE OF MYSELF IN SUCH A POSITION THAT LIKE IT PLATE GOBLETS HANDLE IN THIS HOLE ON OUR <UNK> AND MAKE MY CAN WILL COME OUT FOR GOOD POSITIONING SHOT FOR THE EIGHT BALL AND WIN THE GAME
SIDE IT'S EXAMPLE ON THE CORNER OF HIM ON AND YOU SEE THE CUE BALL COMES OUT TO A POSITION ON THE TABLE WHERE I HAVE A NICE SHOT AN ANGLE SHOT FOR THE EIGHT BALL ON THE CORNER
FOR THE PIERCING ROUGH BALL WAY AROUND
BY HITTING THE SOURCE BALL IN THE WATER MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T PEAK ON THE WAY IN IS NOT PEAKING AFTER AS WELL
THEN WE ADDED THE SECOND BALL AND TRY THE SAME THING
WE STARTED WITH JUST A SINGLE BALL
TO THROW A THREE BALL AT
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE BALL GOING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
SO THE BALL IS SNAPPED SET KNOW EVEN USE A SWIM THROUGH EVERYTHING EIGHTY NORMALLY DOESN'T SKIN LOOK JUST LIKE ROUTE
NOW I'VE DONE ENOUGH SOME OTHER ONES WHERE THICK ENOUGH SPIN AROUND AND CATCH THE BALL AND THESE ARE FOR DOWN THE PATTERNS WHERE YOU ACTUALLY LOOKING BACK OVER YOUR SHOULDER AND IT'S THE TRUE IS WAY TOO DISORIENT YOURSELF AND LOCATE THE BALL OF THE SAME TIME
AND I CAN DO THIS HUNDRED TIMES A DAY AND HIS HAND WILL IMPROVE HIS VISION FOR THE BALL AND HIS ABILITY TO LOCATE
NOW IT'S ON A BALL BEARINGS
WHICH IS THE MY PARTNER IT'S AT THE BALL INTO THE WOODS
AND THEN A TOP TODAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT TO DO IF YOUR PARTNER LOSES HIS GOLF BALL WORK OUT A HELP HIM FIND IT OFF
AS YOU CAN SEE MY PLAIN PARTNER HAS LOST THE BALL ON THE SOLE AND IN THE GAME OF GOLF IS GOOD AT A GOOD OR CUSTOMARY TO HELP CONFINED IS BALL
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF ETIQUETTE ON NOT ONLY WILL YOU HELP SPEED UP PLAY WHICH ALSO BE DOING A PARTNER FAVOR BITE HELPING AND TRY TO LOCATE IS BALL
HE'S GOING TO REACH TEA THE BALL HERE PROVISIONAL JUST IN CASE WE CAN'T FIND OF THE FIRST ONE NINETY HIT INTO THE WOODS
SO WE'RE LOOK AROUND HERE AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND HIS BALL
UP IN FRONT OF THE SMALL TACK THIS AFT WE HAVE OUR LOWER BALL JOINTS WITH THE RETAINING KNOTS AND HARDWARE INSIDE
WE HAVE THE UPPER CONTROL ARM BALL JOINT ASSEMBLY
YOU SEE ON THE BODY TURNS IS TO THROW A BALL OFF
THAT'S CALLED A BODY TURN SO NOW I'VE GOT MY BODY COILED AND WHY UNCOIL IT GENERATES A LOT OF POWER TO HIT THE GOLF BALL
IS WHEN THE BALL COMES OFF A LOT OF WITH THE VARIOUS FEET SWEET NOT ABLE TO HIT IT IS POWERFULLY WAS ACTUALLY IF I NEXT HUMAN LOB SERVE LOAN
IT STILL HAS THESE GUYS GO OUT THIS GUY JOINS ON SO THAT IT'S THREE ONTO THESE GUYS THAT THE BALL THEY BRING IT DOWN AND THAT IT'S THREE ONTO IT GOES BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH
THE WOODS BALL INTO ORIGINAL THE HOSPITAL FALL INTO IT FROM THE BANK FALL INTO THE SUIT KITCHEN
WHITE BASE ARMS OUT ESTABLISHED CONTACT LOW CENTER GRAVITY BALL COMES OFF AT LEAST TWO FEET AWAY FROM THE RED HAVE ESTABLISHED CONTRACT FORCE THAT AGGRESSIVELY GET THE BASKETBALL
OFF AND IN THIS ISN'T A BALL THAT TRADITIONALLY THIS TYPE OF APPARATUS WAS IN A ROUND SHAPE
ABDOMINAL CRUNCH ON THE BALL
ALL THEIR LEAD AND USING A BALL ON A TABLE LEG RUBBER BALL AND JUST KIND OF HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND AND I'M JUST CAN A PRACTICE CROW EXERCISES
SO THE PARSLEY MOSQUITO AND TAKE OFF FOR THE BRIDGE THE STRINGS THE STRING HOLDER WHICH ALL FULL BALL IT ALL THE ALL FULL BODY ACOUSTIC GUITARS THAT ARE ELECTRIC HAVE A STRING HOLDER ON THEM
WHAT THE TAKES A SNAP FIRST OF ALL IS GET A TURN AND HE'S GOING TO DO WHAT WE CALL SINGING A BALL
THESE IS GOING TO SEE THE BALL RIGHT HERE AND GET A LOOK LIKE A FAKE TO THE FULLBACK
OUR QUARTERBACK PRETTY MUCH RUNS IS LIKE YOU WOULD A NORMAL AND OFF POLITE EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT ONCE THE HANDS A BALL OFF OUR QUARTERBACK THEY ALSO ACID TURN AND RUN TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FAILED SO HOLD LEAKING GO DOWN FILLED AND BECOME A BLOCKERS WELL
TAKE A KNEELING POSITION AND AGAIN PULL THE BALL IT'S MY HIP AND PLACE THE HIP ON TOP OF THE BALL TO LEAN OVER AND IT CAN JUST PLACE MY HAND UP ASIDE AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS REDUCE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN MY RIB CAGE AND MY HIP
AND IF I CAN DROP OVER THE BALL EVEN MORE THAN AND GETTING MORE RANGE OF MOTION AND MORE INTENSITY ON THAT MUSCLE GROUP
ONE IS A REALLY IMPORT ON THIS ONE HAS ONE MAKE SURE THAT YOUR HEAD AND OR SHOULDERS ON THE BALL
THAT MAKES RIGHT AT THE BALL CLEANLY
OR I DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION I NEED TO PUT THE BALL SEVENTY FIVE YARDS
SONG OR TRY MY SAND WEDGE SO HERE I'M NOT TRYING TO SPIN IT OR PUT IT ON THE GREEN ON A START ADVANCE THE BALL TOWARD THE GRAIN OR TO GET IT TO THE GREEN WITH A FULL CLAW
NOW I'M ALSO NEW TAUGHT MARPLAN BALL OF THE BRACED LOTS OF TIMES YOU'LL SEE ON A PULL LIKE THIS WHEN YOU PLAYING OUTDOORS OR YOU'LL SEE AN ACTUAL ALL COMBINATION OF THINGS OF BRACING THE BAG BOARD UP IF YOU TALK ABOUT INDOORS
ONE THING THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PART ACTUALLY PLAYING BASKETBALL IS THE BALL
IT DEPENDS ON HOW BIG THE BALL IS GOING TO BE THAT WERE USING FOR HIS EYE
IT EARLIER WAS PLAYED WITHOUT PING PONG PADDLES LIKE A TABLE TENNIS GAME IN AN TURNED INTO WHERE YOU JUST THROW THE BALL AND THE CUP ON WHICH MEET A LOT EASIER AND A HALF A BIT DRUM CLOCK COOKER HONESTLY
ONCE YOU GO INTO OUR RATION THE BALL AND IT WOULDN'T SIGNIFICANTLY
IF IT'S REALLY THIN BALL
YOU WANT THE BALL IS IN THE CHICKEN BREAST BECAUSE IT GIVES THE CHICKEN MORE FLAVOR
OKAY IN YOU FEEL THE PRESSURE ON THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE SIX BALL IN THE SIDE POCKET
SO WHAT I DO IS I AM I STICK BEHIND THE CUE BALL AT WHERE I WANT A HIT ON THE SIX BALL
HI THIS IS YOLANDA VANDERVEEN FROM VANDERVEEN BALL
SO JUST MAKE SURE YOU KEEP IT OUT AS CLOSE TO YOUR BODY TO AN YUKON THAT THE BALL ON THE SWING FOR YOU
AGAIN AND WHAT HAPPENS ON THE BACK AND SITE BECAUSE WE ARE MOVING A BODY FALL AND WE'RE AIMING THE BALL AS YOU CAN SEE MY FACE OF THE RACKET IS LOOKING OVER THEY INSTEAD OF LOOKING IN FRONT OF ME AND IT'S HOT PINK AS MY RAISE THIS GIVING NAP MIGHT HAVE RISKY THE NAP OR MAY BODY'S GOING FOR ONE
IF YOU GET A OUTWARD AND DO THE OF PACKING INVOLVING YEARS YOU HIT A BACKHAND DRIVE TO LEAVE AND SO THIS IS A GOOD ANGLE TO SEE HOW GARY REPAIRS OR AND TURN THE SHOULDER AND STEPS IN THE BALL INSULT AND BE GOOD TO WATCH LIKING MY RACKET UP IN A VOLLEYBALL GENTLY WEDGES OPENING THE FACE IN THE BACK OF THE WALL
IF IF FOR THE OTHER IS TURNS FULL OFFERING EFFORTLESSLY STRENGTH IF <UNK> DON'T LIVE FOOD REALLY DOESN'T TAKE MUCH WORK TO GET THE BALL THAT FLY DEVELOPMENT FROM FALLING OFF VERY THE VALVES LIFE IF IT'S FUN WORKOUT ZOOM
IF THE STEPS OF THE BALL
AND THIS SEGMENT WE ARE SHOW YOU HOW IT LOOKS ANOTHER ANGLE SO WATCH AND TAKE NOTE OF HOW GARY TURNS AND IT'S THE RACQUET READY STEPS AND THE BALL HIT AND BACK TO THE MID NOTICE HOW I OPEN THE FACE THE RACK AND INTO LOFTED KNACKS AND HE CAN HIT IT AGAIN
A PERSONAL TRAINER IS SOMETHING WORTH ONE ON ONE WITH THE BALL
IN OTHER WORDS THAT'S THE ACTION THAT WE REALLY WANT ON THE CUE BALL IS NO ACTION AND ALL
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS SLIDE INTO THAT BALL
BECAUSE OF ITS SLIDES STRAIGHT INTO THE OBJECT BALL WHICH COULD HAPPEN IS THE CUE BALL THE ANY IMPART ALL OF ITS ENERGY TO THE OBJECT BALL SENDING THE OBJECT BALL ON ITS WAY IN THE CUE BALL THE LOSE EVERYTHING HAS GOT ROOM FOR IN ITS THOSE STOPPED AND STUFF
OKAY OUR NEXT I'LL SHOT ARE ON OUR THREE MOST BASIC HUG CUE BALL POSITION SHOT IS THE STOCK SHOT
AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF AN ACTION DO WE NEED TO HAVE ON THE CUE BALL ON CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT BALL IN ORDER TO GET IT TO STOP
AND I'M JUST GOING VALUE WHAT YOU WON'T BE LOOKING FOR ON EVERY STOP SHOT REGARDLESS OF DISTANCE IS YOU WANT TO BE TRYING TO CATCH THE CUE BALL IN ITS LIE
SO FROM THIS POSITION RIGHT HERE IN ORDER TO SLIDE THIS BALL FROM THERE THERE IT SHOULD BE A SIMPLE MATTER OF HITTING IT RIGHT AT THE CENTER
ALSO MAKE SURE YOUR HANDS HAS THE BALL THE EXACT SAME TIME
SO WHEN YOU'RE SETTING THE BALL TAKE THE BALL ABOVE YOUR HEAD WHERE IF IF YOU MISS THE BALL OR HIDDEN FOREHEAD
THE THING THE BALL AND SAYS THAT AN IN OUR THING HANDS VERY LONG ZOOMED IN OUR THINGS POSSIBLE
HEY IF I'M HERE IN A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER AND I PUSH MORE WITH THE BALL IN MY FOOT AND THEN WORK TO STEER DROP MUSCLE MORE RIGHT IN HERE RIGHT IN HERE WHICH IS IMPORTANT AREA TO WORK IT PROTECTS YOU NEED
THIS IS IN A SHOT OFF THE WATER TO THE ENTIRE HOUSE AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL HAVE TO BE DOING THIS ONCE WE INSTALLER BALL VALVE
IN THIS VIDEO CLIP I'LL THEORIES GET THROUGH IN A PROCESS OF INSTALLING A BALL VALVE
IS THAT THE SIZE OF A OF A WEIGHTED BALL
I'M A CHORD MINIMUM IS IN THE FIFTY FEET TO ONE HUNDRED FEET ON THE HOOK IT TO A GFI ULTRA IF THIS WERE DELETE OR THE CHORD WOULD WOULD BREAKER THAT WATER THAT IN THE BALL ANYTHING LIKE THAT TO SAVE YOURSELF IN <UNK>
WE WANT TO DO IS FOR THE BALL ON THE TOP OF THE CLUB LOOK AT THAT BALL
IT ALSO IS THAT THE OTHER END OF THE BALL
AND IT HAS THE VILLAGE ON THE BALL AND TODAY AND AND DEJON AND MAKE SOME CUBAN STOCKING HEAVY
IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR SUCCESSFUL VASE MULTI IF YOU WANT THE BALL THAT ONE COMMON FOR <UNK>
YOU DON'T WANT HIM TO THE BALL IN OUT TOO MUCH
THE OF ONE BALL TO ONE UP TO <UNK>
<UNK> IS A NORMAL THREE BALL PATTERN HERO ONE STRAIGHT UP AND THROW THE OTHER TWO STRINGS
LIKE THIS WHERE ONE BALL IS CONTINUOUSLY CROSSING OVER THE TOP OF THE OTHERS
FOR EVERY BALL IS CROSSING OVER THE BALL IN FRONT OF
NEXT WE'LL BE MOVING ON TO SOME MORE ADVANCE BALL TRICKS
AS FAR AS FLIGHT HATS EVERYTHING IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL THE THREE BALL JUGGLING TO GIVE THE ADDED COMPLEXITY OF THE CLUBS SPINNING ENOUGH TO BE PAY ATTENTION THAT UNIT CATCH THE RIGHT HAND OUT
THAT WAY PUERTO GROW IT POP IT OUT THE GLASS IS STILL ON SERVICE THOSE BE EVEN NOW RIGHT NOW IT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BALL FLAT ELF
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF SMALLER TRACKS AND EVEN SOME EIGHT BALL TRACKS THAT ARE SANCTIONED
HE'LL GUIDE YOU THROUGH ALL THE BALL OF THE CONTRACT RUNNING TO MAKE SURE THAT HE'S PROTECTING YOUR SITE
TUCK ORGAN AND DO IS TAKE AND SLIP RIGHT BACK IN HERE AND INSTALL OUR CAMBER BALL
OTHERWISE USE A NOZZLE USE A TENNIS BALL OR SOME LIKE THAT
YOU COULDN'T TWIST YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER AND YOU CAN TURN YOUR RIGHT FOOT OUT ON THE HEEL AND ALLOW THE LEFT TOE TO TURN ON THE BALL THE FOOT
AND THIS IS FOR A BALL THAT LITTLE BIT DEEPER THAT IS WHY YOU KNOW <UNK> SAVE YOUR YOUR STEPS AND NOT HAVE TOO MANY
KNEES THIGH CRIMES WITH ALL WHERE THE FITNESS BALL SUPPORT
ANYWAY IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE ARROW WITH FISH ENDING OF THE BODY EYES RECOMMEND THAT YOU WATCH THE CLEAT WITH THE POSITIONING SO YOU LEARN HOW TO GET THE BALL CORRECTLY
THE LAST IN OUR THREE BASIC CUE BALL POSITION SHOTS IS THE DROP SHOT
WHERE WHAT WERE WANTING TO DO IS WE'RE LEARNING TO PULL THE CUE BALL BACK TOWARDS IT'S
THIS IS MY LAST OBJECT BALL IN THE TABLE
BUT AGAIN IF I'M GOING TO STOP MY CUE BALL RIGHT THERE THAT'S NOT GOING IN A GOOD SHOT
IF I FOLLOW ALONG BEHIND IT THAT'S NOT REALLY DO ANYTHING FOR ME MY BALL IS WAY OVER HERE
SO I NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE CUE BALL TO BRING IT BACK TO GIVE ME AN EASY SHOT ON THE EIGHT BALL
WELL THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO TAKE A BOLD OFF THE QUEENS DESIGNED AND BRING IT OVER TO THE BALL THAT YOU HAVE A MAZZARELLA IN AN REMOVE ALL OF THE CHEESE WHICH IS NOW SLIGHTLY TINTED GREEN FERMENT FRESH BASIL WHICH IS REALLY GREAT FOR THE AND THE OF THEM IN OUR NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO PUT IT ON OUR BACK GET SLICES WHICH ARE OUR CRISS TINI I PUT IT ON FAIRLY THICK LIKE THIS MOUNTING AND AND GETTING IT ABSOLUTELY TO EVERY EDGE OF THE OUT AND GET
HALF AND IT IS REEDS IMPRESSIVE WENT A MEDICINE BALL
IF WE'RE NOT AN EYE ON IT IT HAS A MEDICINE BALL AT HIS EYES THE FOURTH HOW AS HUGE ARGUMENT REDUCES LIVE IN A <UNK>
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO THE EARTH LET HER A RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT INTO THE BACK AND FORTH THERE'S IN BALL AND IF YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER ALPHA AND ONE AND TWO AND THREE AND FOUR AND ONE AND THEN IN A THREE AND FOUR
INSTEAD OF HITTING EACH OTHER AND HITTING THE BALL
IF YOU TAKE THE BALL TAKE THE RACKET YOU OPEN THE FACE AND IT IS BLOCK IT AGAINST THE WALL AND THAT'S A FOREHAND VOLLEY RIGHT THERE
IF THE FORCES ME FOR TEAR MY RACKET SO YOU SEE I HIT THE BALL IF I CAN HAVE THE RACKET THIS DROP DEAD
AGAIN MAKE HOLIDAY AND WE HOLD IN LIFE TO VERY BALL OFF THE I THINK THAT IN A
YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE THIS A LITTLE MORE PRONOUNCED THAN YOUR CAT BECAUSE IT CAN BE HARDER TO SEE SONY FIERMAN HAVE SOME SHADOWING GOING ON UNDERNEATH THE BALL ON THE UNDERSIDE I'M NOT GOING MIXED IN ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP IT SOAKS FERMENT HOWEVER YOU LIKE WITH THE SHADOWING
SO WHEN WE DO DRIBBLE WHEN IT'S OUT FOR A PLAYING A GAME OF AND WE GET THE BALL SILLY ACTUALLY THROWS US THE BALL TO WHAT WE DO
WE CAN SHOOT THE BALL WE CAN PASS THE BALL THE LIMBERED TEAMMATES OR WE CAN TROUBLE
WE DON'T UPON THE BALL
FIRST THING YOU WANT TO CONSIDER IS JUST TO GRAB THE BALL
AND YOU KNOW MANY FIND THAT THE SCENES AND BAD DEPENDING ON HOW BIG YOUR HANDS ARE ON THE YOU KNOW THE THUMB OF THE BALL OR THE THUMB ON ONE OF THE SEAMS AND THEN THE THREE AT LEAST THREE ON THE YOU KNOW A REVERSE FINGERS ON THE EURO THE OUTSIDE OF THE SCENES
THERE'S A UCLAF ON THAT AFTER TIGHTENING ANYONE TO FIT ON THE BASE OF THE BALL FAIRLY THICK KNOT
HALF ONE LITTLE MONKEY JUMPING ON THE BANK THE EDGE OF THE BALL THIS HAND ON THE CALL THE DOCTOR IN THE DOCK THERE'S STATIC NOW IT WILL ON MY <UNK> K IS JUMPING ON A BAD
THE TOOLS UP THAT I USE FOR THROWING LODGED BOWLS THESE IN MY MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS IN THESE THE RIBS WOODEN RIBS AND I USE THOSE TO SHAPE THE BALL AND TO SQUEEZE THE CLAY WILL SHIMON THAT LAND
THESE ARE TRIMMING TOOLS WILL USE THESE ONCE THE BALL HAS DRIED OUT AND WILL FLIP IT OVER AND USE THESE TO TRIM THE BASE OF IT
SO OF MY TEAM SERVE THE BALL BUT AT THE OTHER TEAM GETS THE BALL AND PUTS IT INTO OUR SIDE OF THE COURT AND THEY GET THE POINT EVEN THOUGH THEY INSERT THE BALL AND VICE VERSA
WE GOT EIGHT OUNCES IT ON AND THE SECOND BALL AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NICE AND SMOOTH
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO CREATE AN ARC SO THAT AT THE TOP OF IT LOCKS THE BALL GOES UP OVER IN AN ARC IN AND OUT IN YOUR OPPOSITE HAND
IN ONE OF THE ABLE TO DO THIS MUCH THE SAME WAY THAT WE'RE THROWING ONE BALL UP AND CATCHING IT AND THINGS SPOT
NUMBER THREE GET YOUR HANDS IN FRONT OF A BALL
IF YOU BOX OUT IN ONE OF THE SHOE THAT YOU FEEL AND CONTRACT FIRST BEFORE YOU GO FOR THE BALL
IF YOU JUST GO OVER THE BALL WITHOUT STABS IN CONTACT OF UP A REALLY SMART PLAYER LIKE MYSELF WILL SLIDE IN FRIDAY VIVID WAS THE ABS TO POSITION
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A BRIDGE THAT'S UP WHEN YOU FINGERTIPS SO THE TO BE OVER THE BALL
NOW WHAT MAKES IT SO DIFFICULT IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE TO ELEVATE THE INTERVIEW CUE STICK IF YOU DO NOT HIT BID CENTER ON THE BALL WHATEVER ENGLISH IS THE JUVENILE ACCIDENTLY PUT ON THE CUE BALL WILL MAGNIFIED BECAUSE IT WILL BE A SLIGHT MASS SAY SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE WARPED THAT CHEER SERVED GOING TO HIT THE CENTER THE BALL OR IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON USING THIS TO MAKE SURE THE TO ALLOW FOR
OCCASIONALLY WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING IN YOU GET LEFT A SHOT WHERE THE CUE BALL IS CLOSE TO ANOTHER BALL OR YOU PLAYED POSITION IN THE TEMPLATE IT VERY WELL IN THE VET SHOOT OVER BALL
TODAY WE'RE TALKING A LITTLE BIT OF THAT HOW TO SHOOT OVER AN OBJECT BALL
AND THAT'S HOW YOU SHOOT OVER A BALL
SO NOW YOU TAKE YOUR STROKES AND YOU JUST SHOOT OVER THE BALL OR ANY MAKE THE BALL IN IN THE POCKET
IT TAKES TO FEELS VERY QUICKLY AND IS THE QUITE IF THE BALL THE BALL CRACKS THAT YOU CAN ON
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE JONES IS ON TO SOME MEDICINE BALL PUSH UPS WHY RYAN'S GOING TO DO SOME PUSH UP USING THE CANDLE BELLS JUST TO HELP THE RANGE OF MOTION IN HIS CHEST
CURL THE LOWER FINGERS THE ROUND THE YARN TO HOLD IT IN YOUR BALL
FOR THE LONG TAIL CAST ON TAKE YOUR YARN IN GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF LENGTH TO THE SHORT AND PLACE THAT OVER YOUR THUMB AND THEN THE OTHER END ATTACHED TO THE BALL OVER YOUR POINTER FINGER
NOW YOU WANT TO SPEND SOME TIME ROLLING BACKWARDS IN GETTING COMFORTABLE IN THIS POSITION BECAUSE SINCE YOU DON'T ROLL BACKWARDS VERY OFTEN BIG CAN SOMETIMES CATCHING OFF GUARD IF YOU GET SOMETHING TO ROLL AND BALL DIRECTLY IN THE DIRECTION YOU'RE HEADED SO YOU'RE ROLLING BACKWARDS AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR FEET IN THE OLLIE POSITION
THING SHOTS ARE NOT ONLY PRETTY LATH THEIR AFFECTIVE HAND OF THEIR HIGHER PERCENTAGE SHOT WHEN YOU USE THEM PROPERLY THEN JUST SHOOTING THE BALL OF THE ROOM ON
NOW IMPORT PARTY GAME OF DATA BE A BALL HANDLING
AND WHENEVER YOU DO A NOTEBOOK THAT BALL HANDLING YOU GOTTA DO DRILLS AND PRACTICE IN ORDER TO GET GOOD AT IT
HI I'M TRAVIS AND WHAT A SHOW YOUTH JEFF HALF OF THE FAT HIS BETTER THATS BALL HANDLING THIN SEVEN MINUTES A DAY
OUR AT A FORK BALL HANDLING DRONE SHOW YOU'VE IS ONCE YOU HAVE A BALL WOULD TAKE THEM OFF BRING IT DOWN BELOW YOUR ANKLES BUT DOWN BELOW YOUR ANKLES AND GO AROUND YOUR ANKLE WAVE THEY WAVE ANKLE WAVE HIT WAVE ANKLE AND HIS GO FASTER AND FASTER HEADLIGHT FIZZ WITH
NOW THIS IS A MEDIUM TO EASY BALL JUGGLING PATTERN WHEN YOU DO IT WITH THREE
ALL YOU'RE DOING A SET OF CATCHING AND THROWING LIKE THIS RETURN OR HAND OVER AND GRAB THE BALL FROM THE TOP
LET'S WORK ON THAT WITH BOTH HANDS NEVER WANT TO ALLOW ADDED INTO THREE BALL PATTERN
IF WE JONESY'S DOING HERE IS THAT HE'S PUSHING THE BALL BACK AND FORTH
OR A DEEPER STRETCH ON THE BALL UP TO YOUR BLACK
IT IN AND TO BE DOING A REALLY REALLY LARGE AREAS CAN BE MORE ECONOMICAL TO PURCHASE IT IN BALL CAN HAVE IT DELIVERED TO YOUR HOME
IT COMES IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT FORMS YOU CAN BUY IN BAGGAGE CAN LIVE IN BALL CAN HAVE IT DELIVERED BY TALK TO YOUR HOME
SO IS ANOTHER REALLY FORMAL SOCKS WHICH TENNIS BALL THEN OFFER ANGLES ONION WITHIN THE FIRST FIVE SECONDS OF PUTTING MY
SO IF YOUR BIG CAPTAIN AND COKE FAN OF FUSION WHEELER IS OF IF THE BALL OR A FLEECE IF IT HOLD A LATCH I'LL THE CALF AND PATTERNS FOR LITTLE THAT IF SOMETHING DIFFERENT
TAKE OUR RIGHT FOOT UP AND TAKE US TRAVEL ON THE BALL THE FOURTH AND THAT EQUALIZE THE LEAF WAS FROM AN ISSUE EQUALIZE LIKE THE STRAP SECURE AROUND YOU WRITE HE AND SEE HAVE A GOOD FIRM GRIP
SO BASICALLY HERE GOING AROUND LIKE THIS WITH YOUR THUMB THAT THE BOTTOM IN YOUR INDEX FINGER IS AT THE TOP PRESSING IN THE TOP OF A BALL THEY GIVE IT THE APPEARANCE OF EMOTION CAT
THE STABILITY BALL EXERCISES THAN A TARGET THE OBLIQUES WHICH RUN ON THE SIDE OF THE WAYS
FOR THE OUTLET TO WORK YOU NEED A HEAT BALL
THERE IS PROFESSIONAL PAINT BALL IS THE FROM WAKE DOES NOT HAVE FLAG
IS THAT IT'S A SEVEN ON SEVEN SHOULD EVERYBODY IN THE DATA GRAB THEIR FLAG FOOT ON THE SIDE AND THERE'S RECREATIONAL PAINT BALL WHICH IS JUST LIKE FAMILIES COME IN ON YOUR SHOULD EACH OTHER A BIG PLAY CAPTIVE FLAGS OF LEAD THAT IT'S MOLD IT'S MAYLEE ELIMINATION
AND FROM HERE I CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND STROKE THE BALL
REMEMBER AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING THE BALL OUT RIGHT MAY SHOW AT ANY ACCURATE IN
THREE BALL OUR EYE TO A SENTENCE ON THE EYE
I HOPE THAT AND GET THAT ALL OR ONE OF THE ONES THAT IN BIG HUGE LUNGE IN THE HULA TRY IT EVEN A V HAM BOTTOMS BALL
AND IT'S THIS SLOWLY HOT AND TELL IF HE EXHALE AND ONE OF THOSE NICE AND SLOW AND AGAIN SQUEEZE THE HAND ON THE BALL OR THEY GET CONNECT THE MUSCLES THAT TRICEP
IF YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS ARE BARS AND HE'S TRYING TO GIVE YOU A HAND OFF ON THE WRONG SIDE A NEW DUTCHER ELBOW OUT THERE CHANCES ARE YOU GETTING HIT WITH YOUR ARM AND AND NOT THE BALL LOOSE FROM THE QUARTERBACK
YOU WANT YOUR DOG TO GET THE RIGHT OF WHITE TO WRAP UP THE BALL IF YOU TAKE THE THE HAND OFF IN THE WRONG WAY
THE SECOND WAY IS GUMMY HARD FOR THE QUARTERBACK TO GIVE YOU THE BALL IF YOU'RE NOT OPEN UP THE PROPER WAY
IT'S GOTTA BE OPEN SO THE QUARTERBACK AND SLIDE THE BALL IN
THE SEVENTIES THIS TECHNIQUE GETTING OFF THE BALL AND EVERYTHING BUT HE'S IN A DRAW A LINE STRAIGHT TO THAT FREE SAFETY WHICH IS CALLED STOCK BLOCKING
SO BASICALLY YOU ARE YOU READY TO PUT THIS INTO A BALL
AND THE BALL COMES YOU WILL GET A PERSON SHOULD GO AROUND THEIR DEFENDER <UNK> GO TO THE SIDE THE COME AROUND THEM OR USE CANNA YOU CUT THAT WOULD EVER
OF REMEMBER FROM BALL JUGGLING MULTIPLEX IS WHEN YOU THROW MORE THAN ONE BALL IT ONCE OR IN OUR CASE WOODLAND CLUB WHAT'S
THE OTHER THING AND ONE A DO SPECIALLY SUCH AS WITH HIS BEAR WHERE WE KNOW THAT HAS BEEN PAINT THE BALL IS BROKEN AND IF YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU BRING ALL THAT DEBRIS OUT
SO I'M TRYING TO PICK A HIGH POINT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE BALL IN THE HOLE
JUST TRY TO GET A SENSE OF HOW HOT HOW HARD THE BALL NEEDS TO BE MOVING HERE FOR IT TO GET TO THE HOLE
THAT MAKES IT SO THE BALL JOINT AND UP RECITAL BOLT IN THROUGH YOUR CONTROL ARM BUSHING HOLES
IN ORDER TO DO THAT ON A FULL SIZE VEHICLE YOU GET A WINE GET A BALL JOINT PRESS
IT IS A COUPLE KEY PLAYERS REMEMBER IN BETTER NINETY WRANGLES WHICH A LOWER BODIES YOUR SHOULDERS IN YOUR HEAD AND IF THEY ON THE BALL
WE DON'T BE UP HERE WHERE YOUR LOWER BACK IS ON THE BALL IS OR PUSH NOT CAUSES OF A LOT OF STRAIN IN YOUR NECK SO AZURE SETTING UP KEEP IT RELATES DOWN BY YOUR SIDES NUGAN AND COME FROM A SEATED POSITION TO WILL YOURSELF ALL THE WAY DOWN UNTIL YOU FEEL YOUR HEAD IN YOUR SHOULDERS TOUCH THE BALL
YOUR LEFT SIDE YOUR WEAKER SIDE AND HE'LL BELIEVE IT'S WEAKER IF YOUR ARE RIGHT HANDED TRY THROWING A BALL LEFTY SEE HOW FAR GOES
AROUND IN A CIRCLE NICE IN CONTROL KEEPING THE BALL RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU
A THIRD THING YOU CAN DO IS YOU DO BALL TOUCHES IS STANDING ON ONE SIDE THE BALL
THE FIRST DRILLS ORGAN WORK ON A DIFFERENT KINDS OF BALL TOUCHES DIFFERENT DIFFER MOVE
THE FIRST ONE IS IS A SIMPLE BALL TOUCH RIGHT ON THE TOP OF THE BOW
THE SECOND THING YOU CAN DO IT THIS IS GO AROUND THE BALL
AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU LEARN HOW TO CONTROL THE BALL AND LEARN HOW TO DRIBBLE
AND IF YOU DON'T END UP WITH THIS HALF BALL AND TAKE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PART OF IT AND POINT IT UPWARDS
MOST THE OUTDOOR ROUTE ROLLER HOCKEY PLAYERS WOULD USE A BALL JUST LIKE THIS
BUT BASICALLY OF THE BALL MOVES REALLY WELL OUT HERE
EYES AS WE'RE A OUTDOORS WHAT I GET AS A MY ROLLER HOCKEY BALL
SO WHAT WE'RE IN A GOOD WAY TO TAKE OUR BALL WITHIN A CUT OFF IF THIRD OF IT
TO GIVE YOU THE MOST OPTIONS IF YOU WANNA GET A LOT A LOFT ON THE BALL
SO ON IT'S A GREAT WEAPON KNOB AND BECAUSE IT'S SO LOFTED THOUGH IT DOES TAKE A LOT OF PRACTICE TO GET IT'S WHERE YOU'VE GOOD CONTROL WITH BECAUSE OF WHICH ARE DOING IS ARE COMING UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND AIR OF LEARNING TO POP IT OUGHT TO A GOOD TO THE RIGHT DISTANCE SO YEAH TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THE SIXTY DEGREE CLUB AND IT'S A GREAT CALLED AND LET'S SEE A HOW IT GOES HERE
OKAY THE SIXTY DEGREE WEDGE IS REALLY LOFTED AND OUT OF ONE THING I FORGOT TO MENTION OF A FIVE PREVIOUS SEGMENTS MAYBE IS THAT IF YOU OPEN THE FACE YOUR CLUB IT DOES INCREASE THE LOFT ON WHICH MEANS IT PUTS THE BALL HIGHER
SO THE SIXTY DEGREE WEDGE IS ANOTHER WAY OF LOCKING THE BALL HIGH SO WHEN IT LANDS IT STOPS
GET A GREAT OF ONE OF THE WE CAN ACTUALLY PLAY THAT BALL
AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO HERE IS WE WANT LIKE BALL HANDS COME UP AND TURN TO THE CORNER
THAT HOWETH IN A BALL
REMEMBER KEEP REVEALING ALL THESE TECHNIQUES THE BALL IN THE FINGERS AS MUCH FISHING INTO
GO AHEAD AND SWITCH SITES POSTER FOOT IN THE CENTER OF THE BALANCE TRAINER IF BOTH HANDS ON THE MEDICINE BALL OF MONEY AN UPRIGHT POSITION IN AND PUSH FORWARD AND SET IT BACK
LITERALLY JUST SIT BACK A SITE SWAP POSITION AND PUSH YOUR BALANCE AND PUSH YOUR MEDICINE BALL FOLLOW
<UNK> RELAXER SHOULDERS CUTER HEAD NICE LEVEL AND EXHALE AS YOU PUSH THE BALL WAY FOR ME
AND CHEW ON UNTIL IT'S COME IN A NICE EVEN ANGLE WITH YOUR BALANCE TRAINER PLACE ONE FOOT IF TRYING KEEP IT FAIRLY BALANCE IN THE CENTER OF YOUR BOUNCE TRAINER BOTH HANDS ON A MEDICINE BALL
I'VE SEEN SOME THEY'RE JUST REAL TIME INTO WILL BALL OF THE ARTIFICIAL FIREWOOD
AS YOU BRING THE BALL DOWN THE FLOOR AND I GO AGGRESSIVELY TO TRY TO SCORE
OKAY NOW INTO DIFFERENT SERVER WHICH IS THE LIKE SIR SO MY GOAL IS TO HIT THE BALL SOMEWHERE HER THOUGHT I RACKET TRUE AT HER IN OR THE RED LINE THE REASON BEING IS WHEN THE BALL HITS IN THAT AREA AND MIGHT BE OPPONENT THAN A MUCH OF A SHOT
<UNK> THE BALL A WALL WHERE HIS NECK TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET IT FOR HIM FROM WOLF SO IF I HIT IT JUST LIE HE'S IN EVERY REACH A JOB
SO BY HITTING THE BALL UP HERE MY OPPONENT IS FOURTH TAKE THE BALL ON <UNK> IN THE OR YET THICKEN BECAUSE OF LIGHTING COME OFF ABOUT WALLET NINE BANG HERE SO THIS IS A VERY VERY EFFECTIVE SHOT OUT SO ONCE YOU'VE MASTERED THE TECHNICAL SKILLS OF DOES HITTING A BALL AND HE'S IN THE INNER ONE A START INCORPORATING HITTING IT JUST ONS ON THE SIDE WALL TO THE <UNK> THAT MUCH MORE FOOD
RIGHT LIKE THAT TO ABIDE BY KEEPING THE BALL THAT PART OF THE WALL THEY CAN'T ATTACK ME VERY MUCH I'LL USE THE BIG BOWL
WHEN YOU SERVING A BALL TAKE THE BOTTOM FRONT OF YOU TOSS IT IN FRONT OF YOU FIGURE HAND BACK LEAD WITH THE ELBOW KEEP YOUR HAND OPEN AND SERVE THE BALL OVER THEM
SO SOMETIMES IF ANYTHING IF YOU HOLD IT IN AND SOMETIMES <UNK> AND ALL YOUR BALL THAT YOU CAN USE
SOME HOLD ON TO THE BALL IS YOU SLOWLY WALK YOURSELF OUT
AGAIN IN THIS POSITION ONE LETS GET YOU HAD RESTING ON THE BALL AND NOT LETTING HIP SAGS OR EVEN USE THE GLUTES THE CONTRACT TO LIFT THE HIPS AND HAVE YOUR HEAD IN LINE WITH YOUR SPINE
YOU THAT THAT CAN HELP UKE STRONG RECOVER BACK FAUCET GOUT ATTACK THE BALL
SO IT'S A JUST THINK THE DISTANCE FOR THE LENGTH OF THE STRING WE THE SADDLE ADJUSTMENTS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PITCH OF THE HOSE THREE THINGS ALL THE <UNK> BALL OCTAVE HARMONIC HAY AND PLAYED NOTE ARE ALL EXACTLY THE SAME
JUST USE A LOT AND TO HAVE AT HOME LAYERED HITS BOOM GOODEN'S LIGHT LAST INTO THE THE BALL AND YOU LIGHTS YOU LINE GUESS OF THE PARTY AND THIS IS OUR <UNK>
WITH A FLAT AND LIFTED WITH THAT WOULD GIVE AND WHEN IT GETS THE N WITH THE BALL STRAIGHT RIGHT WITH THIS LEAF
THE MIXER VIEW OF THE BALL THE MIX WINDOW
A LOT OF TIMES THAT COME FROM A GUY THAT IS EITHER NOT LISTENING TO THE CADENCE IS NOT WATCHING THE BALL OR TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE BALL YOU MAKE THE MISTAKE ANY JUMPS OFF SIDES PREMATURELY
THERE CAN BE OFFSIDE CALLED AGAINST A CENTER FOR MOVING OR WILL BE CALLED MANIPULATING THE BALL TO THROW OFF OF THE FENCE
A LOT OF TIMES LEAD LET THE BALL THE BALL WILL BE LAYING ON THE GROUND IT MAY EVEN BE TURN TO THE SIDE
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN OUR CENTER GOES DOWN THE SNAP THE BALL THAT WE DON'T GET ANY PENALTIES
HE'S ALLOWED TO GRAB THAT BALL AND GO AHEAD AGAINST THAT WILL WANT TO GET THAT BALL SET THE KEY OF THE MOVEMENT
EITHER NOT ASYMMETRICAL ON AS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT HERE NEXT TO THE BALL JOINT GREYS BLUE THERE IS AN L
IT'S NOT AS BANDING THE BALL BACK AND FORTH
IT'S ALSO SPOT BALD WHICH MEANS CAN GIVE YOU A TIGHT BEAM HEAT GOING STRAIGHT DOWN FROM THE BALL OKAY
AND NOW I AM THE PROPER DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE BALL
THE BALL OR ACTUALLY SMALL FOR WILL HAVE THIS RESPONSIBILITY I HEAR ANYTHING BEYOND THAT POINT GUARDS REACH IS ON ON THIS SIDE OF THE COURT WILL BE THAT SMALL FORCE RESPONSIBILITY
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT A GOAL LIFTING YOUR HEELS UP LIKE THIS WAY WHEN A FILL THE PRESSURE WHO CAN THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT
IF THE BALL AND THE OF SHIFTING YOUR WEIGHT AND FIGURING OUT <UNK>
THE BALL BUT WE WANT TO DO IS WHEN OUR QUARTERBACK TAKES A SNAP FIRST OF ALL IS IN A TURN AND IS GONNA FLAKE TO THE FULLBACK
SO GETTING THE GRIP RIGHT WILL ALLOW YOU TO HIT A BALL NICELY UP FOR GROUT WILL GIVE YOU ALL TYPES OF COMPENSATIONS BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT
THIS BALL TYING ANTES WE'RE NOT REALLY TRYING TO ALIGN WITH ANYTHING ELSE
AFTER THAT WILL TALK ABOUT THE GAME TO PLAY LIKE EIGHT BALL NINE BALL ROTATION CUT THROAT AND CARNIVAL FINALLY AND THEN A SHOW YOU SOME FUN TRICK SHOT SO YOU CAN PLAY ON YOUR FRIENDS TO SHOW THEM THAT YOU HAVE MORE SKILL THAT YOU ACTUALLY HALF
FOR EXAMPLE OUT OF THE GOTHIC YOU HAD A HOLE THAT YOU HAD A MAKE A BRIDGE SO THAT YOU CAN HIT THE CUE BALL AT IT THE CUE BALL OF DIFFERENT ENGLISH FOR THE CUE BALL
THERE'S A STRAIGHT IN SHOT THERE'S THE BANK SHOT THERE'S THE KICK SHOT THERE'S A COMBINATION SHOT THERE'S A SHOT OFF ONE BALL IF THERE'S A SNOOKER SHOT THERE'S A SAFETY SHOT AND THERE'S A SCRATCH SHOT
THE THIRD THING AGAIN HIT THAT BALL KOREAN AVAILABLE OVER THOSE FORTUNATE GO FLYING OVER HANDLEBARS ARE LEARNING PROCESS
JUST LIKE THE THREE BALL MULTIPLEX START IT'S A COOL WAY STAR
THE FOUR BALL SIDE BY SIDE MULTIPLEX STAR
I JUST PINCH A SMALL NOT CLAY OFF OF MY CLAY AND ROLLED INTO A BALL AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE TO MAKE THE KNOT
BE WE USED A LOT FOR DIFFERENT THREE BALL PATTERN
ROLL OF THAT BALL AGAIN
ITS OWN FILL UP ONE CUP WORTH OF WATER IN LOVE AND THEN SUBMERGE <UNK> THE DIFFUSING BALL INSIDE THE CUT
SO IF IT MIGHT GO AGAINST THAT I'VE GOT A HYDRATING AUBURN WAY OUT WHICH CARBOHYDRATES OF COST OF POTATOES TO GET BEFORE AND I'M GOING UP THE MARATHON HIGH USUALLY YOU CREATE A LIKE A FOUL BALL ARE OPEN OUR FATAL OF GET AN SOMEWHAT MAKE WICKS
THEY DON'T STOP THE BALL OF THE TWO LITTLE STOP LIKE THAT AN INDOOR AFTER BOWLS OR AFTER OUR RED CARDS TO ANYTHING LIKE THAT
SO MY OBJECTIVE NOW'S COME OVER HERE WITH THE ANGLE THAT I NEED TO THEN KICK THE BALL INTO THIS CLOCK
AT ADULT HUVE ON IT WILL COTTON BALL IN CLOVE AND IT OUT IN THE KNEE IF AN
SO LET'S SAY THE BALL IS UP AGAIN LESS
SEE A WIDE AS YOU ARE ACTUALLY IF THE BALL AND IT COMES BACK AROUND THAT
YOU KNOW YOU TAKE OUT LOHNER YOU IN A BALL MONEY FROM YOUR RELATIVES HIGH IN OF FIRST YOU KNOW GET GET EVERYTHING DON'T
NOW WHEN YOU DO IN THAT WAY IT'S JUST LIKE YOU HAVE AND ACT SENIOR CHOPPING WHAT YOU NEED TO THE SAME THING WITH THE BALL AND MINUTE COME ACROSS THE BODY
WHAT DO I DO WITH WHAT MAKES THE HEAT OF THE FEEL FOR THE BALL FLEECE IF THE BALL BACK AND FORTH FLEAS UP HIGHER AND HIGHER
NEXT DRILL BEING A BALL HANDLING ANOTHER IMPORT BAR BALL HANDLING IS DRIBBLING
YOU STILL GOT TO USE THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE MILL GOLDSBERRY ADAPTABLE IN THAT NOW AND ON HIS VARY FROM HITTING THE BALL
NEXT IS THE CAPTIVE BEAD WITH CAPTIVE BEAD IS IT'S A SMALL HOOP WITH THE BALL IS SUSPENDED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BALL POPS RIGHT NOW AND SHOULD POP RIGHT BACK IN LIKE THIS
THE BALL SCREW ON AND OFF MUCH LIKE THE OTHER TWO
THIS IS JUST A FLAT BACK STUD WITH A BALL THE SCREWS ON AND OFF
