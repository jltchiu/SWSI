IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ALL WHERE THE GROUND AND EVEN A FILL THAT THAT TIGHTNESS IN THAT STRETCH RIGHT IN HERE AN INNER THIGHS
WHAT CAN HAPPEN HERE IS THAT THE HIPS IT IN A MOVES STRING RIGHT BACK IN A HORIZONTAL FASHION AND BECAUSE THE HIP COMES BACK THE FOOT IS GOING TO RELEASE
THE RIGHT AND NUMBER IS IN CREATURES TOUGHNESS
TO PUSH UP YOUR LEFT FOOT ONTO YOUR RIGHT WITH THE THROW
AND RECOIL ON THE LEFT LEG WHICH ARE RIGHT THROUGH
SO IT ON A DUE TO THE RIGHT OUT HERE ON THE TRICK IS EDGED AND CREATE A LITTLE KNOB AND THE <UNK> HAVE DOUBLE IT UP

AND WHEN I COME DOWN AND STRIKE AND A STRIKE RIGHT THERE AND AT THE SAME TIME AND BE PULLING WITH MY FINGERS
THAT'S HOW ON BEING TAKE RIGHT NOW

SO A LOT ONCE AGAIN IS TAKEN THE BALL FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
I CAN DO THAT WITH A STRAP BUT I CAN ALSO DO THAT RIGHT HERE JUST TAKING THE HIP IN CREATING LENGTH
JUST DON'T TRY TO KEEP THE FLAG ACTIVE BUT USUALLY USE THIS WILL LAST TRACTORS DISCHARGE MINI ISN'T INHALE TO LIFT THE BODY AND THEN ON THE EXHALE SCHWINN BRING THAT LEG ALL OVER TO THE RIGHT
STILL UTILIZING THE STRAP LEFT HAND OUT RIGHT INTO OUR YOU HAD IT RIGHT HERE AND A
SO FOR THE MAKING A LEFT FIELD TURN ONE OF THE APPLYING PRESSURE TO THE RIGHT BOOM

IN A GOOD AT IT INTO YOUR FORMS WRENCH OR CAUSE OR ANYTHING THAT YOU MAKE UP IS I JUST TO TAKE THE BOAST ASPEN AROUND AND TAKE ONE HAND OFF CATCH ON THE OTHER SIDE AND JUST CONTINUE TO FLIP IT LEFT OR RIGHT HAND WHICH EVERY START OUT WITH
HAVING THE RIGHT LEG BACK IF ONE ANOTHER NINETY DEGREE ANGLE RIGHT HERE IN YOUR A THREE OR TWO GUYS
NOW AS MELISSA INCREASES REIHER ABILITY TO STRIKE FOR SPEED AND POWER RIGHT WHAT I'LL DO IS AS THE HAND COMES DOWN LOW THE HARDER NEXT ON THE ON THE THE HAND IF OKAY IF MEETING THE CLIFF TOUGH
AND THEN BRING IN RIGHT LAUGHING BELL ON IN HERE
A CAR AND IF THAT RIGHT LEFT AND LALLA INTO MY ARM PLAY AND TWO
AND THEN WHEN WHEN IT IS YOUR SPACING IS RIGHT
SAME THING HERE THIS IS A CHALLENGE RIGHT HERE BETWEEN THESE TWO LETTERS AS JUST NATURALLY A BIG SPACE SO SOMEHOW I'VE GOT A FIGURE I HADN'T TIGHTEN THAT UP AND AND I COULD
BECAUSE THAT I'VE SET THIS DRUM KIT OF SO MANY TIMES THAT AND IT WILL JUST CLICK ON ITS NOT RIGHT HIKE
I HAVE THAT THERE IS A FEW RIGHT WAYS TO DO IT TOO
SHOOT AND SNAP YOUR WRIST STRAIGHT OUT IN THE YOYO COMES RIGHT AT THE TOP YOUR HAND
SHOULD LAY THEM OUT ON THE TABLE ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER AND MIX OF THAN RIGHT ORDER AND GET THEM READY TO START MIXING AND MATCHING
WE ARE FILLING UP THESE MOLDS AND I WILL HAVE THIS TEN IN NO TIME SO AFTER THIS IS DONE I'M SURE YOU GUYS WHAT TO DO WITH THAT NEXT AND SO OUR NEXT SEGMENT WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK NOW SHOW YOU WHERE I'M CAN A STICK IT INTO THE MOLDS TO A TO COOL DOWN
AND RIGHT HERE IN MY HAND I HAVE SOME FOOD COLORING IF THE GEL KIND OF FOOD COLORING
OKAY SO FIRS WHEN THEY GO AHEAD AND TAKE OFF OF THE BALL RIGHT HERE WE GO AHEAD AND TAKE LOOSEN THIS BUT WE'RE NOT AND TAKE OUT THE CLAMP ALL THE WAY CAUSE WE ARE GENERALLY USE IT
SO WHEN YOU DO YET MACHETE LISTEN TO IMMEDIATELY AFTER JUST MAKE SURE THAT IT'S RIGHT AND SOUNDS WITH THE ONE IT
BUT JUST TO WEAR THESE ALL ALL ARE ALL PESTICIDE RIGHT ONE FORM ANOTHER AND YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN USING THEM ON ESPECIALLY WITH THE TOPICAL OINTMENTS
THE WOLVERINE JADE ARE THESE TWO SECTIONS OR MOUNTAIN RIGHT BENEATH THE TWO GRINDING WHEELS AND ON ONE SIDE WE HAVE A FLAT TOOL REST IF IT SLIDES IT NOW AND UNDER THIS ONE OFF OF THE ARM FOR THIS LIVES IN AND OUT
AGAIN PLACE ON THE FINGERS WIDE HE IS THE FLOOR IN YOUR LEFT KNEE IT ON THE UPPER TRICEP BACK SIDE OF THE ARM OUT OF THE RIGHT ARM
SO THE <UNK> FRET OF THE HER RIGHT LEG
RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE TO GO HERE DOWN A PROFESSIONAL HER RIGHT NOW
SO AS WE'VE STEPPED PFAFF WITH OUR RIGHT LENGTH INTO NICE AND EAT LUNCH FROM HERE IF WE WANTED SHOES ANNEALING OPTIONS WILL DROP TO THE KNEE IN ON CURL THE TOE
USUALLY YOU CAN TYPE IN THE IT DOWN A PRETTY GOOD IDEA TO THE RIGHT OFF BECAUSE WHEN YOU RE WALK IT IT WILL LOCK
SO OF PART OF THE DIFFICULTY HAND PULLING OFF ONE NOT JUST OF EATING OF VERY QUICK MOVEMENT BY YOUR OPPONENT ON A BLADE BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT FOR TO FOR THE BIEDERMAN OF ALREADY ESTABLISHED RIGHT AWAY
SO MY OPPONENT HAS TO BE GLAD LAID IN I DISENGAGE BEFORE SHE MAKES CONTACT AND IN SUCCESSFUL AND OF COURSE SINCE I HAVE MAINTAIN THAT RIGHT AWAY AT AND WOULD HURT AND TAKE IT FOR ME I WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT IMMEDIATELY WITH THE THRUST
SOME OF YOUR OPPONENT TRIES TO BIND OR TO BEACHER BLADE ANY SUCCESSFULLY OF WE CONTACT COMPLETELY WHILE MAINTAINING RIGHT OF WAY WHEN YOU PULL OFF A SUCCESSFUL AND UH
I CAN ALSO DO SEVERAL IN A ROW AS LONG AS I MAINTAIN THAT RIGHT OF WAY
THIS IS ONE THAT YOU SEE RIGHT HERE THE I'LL BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO USE TODAY
NOW THE CHILD ONES ARE ARE A LOT SMALLER IN THIS ONE RIGHT HERE
BUT IF IT'S A BRIDGE LIKE THIS OTHER JUST A HOLE RIGHT HERE FULLY TO FEED THE STRING
IT'S IS TO TAKE YOU PUT ON THE RIGHT TIME
SO THE INSTEAD OF KICKING WITH THE RIGHT HAND ESSENTIALLY YOU JUST GRIPPING THE STRING WITH YOUR FRET AND FINGER AND PULLING IT BACK ALLOWING THAT STRING TO RING HALF
SO ONCE WE GET THIS THE HEALTH OUR WATER STAYS RIGHT WE WANT TO RIGHT HERE
INSIDE THE TURNOUT BLANKET AND NEXT TO THE HORSE'S SKINNY HAVE ALIGNING THROUGH RIGHT NEXT TO THE HORSE'S KEY
AND THAT'S ON THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT YOU FACE IN THIS BUSINESS UNLESS YOU GET A GREAT JOB RIGHT OFF OF THAT IS IS IT'S BEEN ADDED PATIENCE
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT LATE ON AND START CUTTING
IF THE BALL GOES OUT THE RIGHT SIDE YOU CAN ATTACK THE RIGHT SIDE
THE OF WHERE HERE AND FOR WITH THAT THIGH AND GO STRAIGHT UP OVER YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER AND WITH THE EIGHTH FROM THEIR ORDER OF THAT WITH OUR RIGHT WHITE LIGHT ROUGH AND FRONT RIGHT
THESE YOU BEND IN AND WRAP ADAPTIVE DIVE THEY WERE TO BRING OUR RIGHT FOOT IN AND JUMP TO GET OUR EYE
AND YOU LOOK TOWARD THE RIGHT AS WELL AS YOU THROW YOUR HE AND DOWN ON EIGHT
RIGHT THERE THE MECHANICAL WELD HAS BEEN BROKEN AS YOU CAN SEE OUR UPPER BALL JOINT IS NOW FREE AND WE'RE READY TO CONTINUE WITH THE REST OF THAT IS SANDWICH PROCEDURE
THE MY LEFT FOOT STEP STRAIGHT MY RIGHT FOOT COMES UP ONE TWO
WHY IS HOME SCHOOLING RIGHT FOR ME
WHEN IT IS TAKE THE PUT THE HOOP IN THE MIDDLE IF THE NEEDLE NOSE PLIERS AND IT WILL BEND RIGHT WHERE WE STARTED CUT
OKAY WE CAN BEGIN I GET OUR TANKS OUT BANANA FREQUENTLY WHAT HAPPENS IS OF SEEM TO BE DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT AND ALL OF SUDDEN IT YOU WAKE UP AND HAVE CLOUDY WATER
IS ONE MY FAVORITES AND THAT'S WHAT THE MAIN REASONS AND LIVE CRYSTAL STICKS AND SAID DOUBLE SIX IS THAT I CAN OF EXECUTE THAT RIGHT THERE
I'D LIKE TO HAVE A CHILD LIGHT ON THOUGHT PROCESS THAT THIS IS FUN AND IF YOU FALL THAT YOU GET RIGHT BACK UP AND INTO THE POSE AGAIN
REALLY GET A BLITZ UP THE MIDDLE OR GET A BLITZ IN THE RIGHT OR EVEN A BLITZ FROM THE LEFT
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THESE GUYS HAVE A VERY DELICATE MEMBRANE ALL RIGHT AROUND THE FIFTH IN AND UNDERNEATH THEIR OWN ARMS AND THE TRIANGLE LEASH RUNNING TO TISSUE
SO THIS ONE WILL GO FROM A RIGHT HAND SHAKE LIKE THIS
ANOTHER GOOD THING TO DO IS RIGHT WITH SOME IT'S BETTER THAN IN THERE AND HELP YOU AND I JUST BY WATCHING THEM RIDING AND LEARN HOW TO USE A BETTER RIGHT EXPOSURE SELF
SIZE SLIDE UP BASE MY BODY YOU MY BODY LEVEL HERE KEEP MY HANDS UP THE RIGHT LEG LEAD SIDEKICK STEM FLOOR SHERIFF REVERSE CRUNCH TURN THE FOOT OUT
AS I LAND THAT WEIGHT SO COMES HERE SHIFT FLOORED INTO THE PUNCH AND THEN AS I PLANT THE ARM BACK THAT FOR THE RIGHT LEG OUT
AND LAY ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR PULL YOUR RIGHT LEG COMES UP
NOW AS YOU PRACTICE OF BOTH HANDS MEANING YOU START WITH THE RIGHT HAND'S WHO AND THEN DO IT WITH YOUR LIFE FORCE
RIGHT YOU ALWAYS WANT PRACTICE A CRITICISM WITH A KIND WORK
AN OCTAVE WOULD MEAN IF YOU TAKE THIS WAY LIKE RIGHT HERE IN NEW DOUBLE THE FREQUENCY
ANCHORS EVERYTHING AUTHORITY SO FAR LIKE THE SCREENPLAY STAGE PLAY ON THE AUDIO VIDEO SCRIPT AND ALL YOU PLAY SCRIPT ARE VERY A OF A SPECIFIC FORMATTING ON IN THIS DROP DOWN MENU RIGHT
NICE IT'S RIGHT HERE AND THEN THE SELECT ITEM OPTION AND OF FOR THAT ONE OPEN FROM THEIR AN EXAMPLE
IN THIS EXAMPLE THEY'RE USING IT AS A E A STORY OUTLINE AND YOU CAN SEE THAT ALSO EVEN GOT THE NOVEL JUST RIGHT IN THERE
OUT GO WELL OR ONTO OUR NEXT STEP IN MAKING WIENERSCHNITZEL'S IN RIGHT NOW ARE AND BE GOING OVER THE INGREDIENTS THAN TO COMPLETE OUR FISH
STRAIGHT LEFT STRAFE RIGHT
AT LEFT TRIGGER HEY ENDS HIND END IF THE RIGHT STICK MOVE THIS AROUND
RIGHT HERE WE ARE THIS IS THE OUT TUTORIAL SECTION
INHALE UP THE RIGHT ARM ADD HAVE FUN MOISTURE EDGING TO THE LEFT
FIRST RIGHT IS A KEY WORD CREATURE ABILITY
HERE ON THE CARD COLD MOSQUITO GUARD YOU'LL SEE THAT IT SAYS FIRST RIGHT
BUT YOU DON'T OF MOTION WITH THE LAND WITH THE RIGHT ARM STRAIGHT LEFT STRAIGHT RIGHT STRAIGHT
YOU GO RIGHT YOUR LEFT ARM STRAIGHT MY RIGHT ARM BENDING WRISTS WHAT'S IT LEANS OF THE LOCKS LEAN TO THE RIGHT LEAVES AND THE LAUGH
I DON'T LOSE A HIGH TOURNAMENT ANALYZER AND THAT S USE THEM IN REAL TIME HE HUE OH HI I'M <UNK> WITH A C AND WENT POST WHO AND HALF THE RIGHT FOOT IN
IT S RECORDING THE DATA LIGHT UP LIKE RIGHT WHEN YOU PLAY IT IT'S ACTUALLY THAN OF LIGHT YOU CAN ACTUALLY ADJUST IT WAS PLAY
I SWING MEAN TOUCHING LASH AND RIGHT SWITCHING I DO IS DOES BASSY TAKE ONE OF THE IT'S ONE TWO
THE THAT WAS ABOUT RIGHT TO ME
THE RIGHT HAND SIDE WE HAVE THE LEVER THE CONTROL TO FLEA AT DOESN'T CHAMBER AND THE SWITCH TO TURN IT ON
SOLEMNITY FIRST I'M A PLANT MY FEET IN THE GROUND AND THEN I'M GOING TO REACH MY SHOULDERS BAM AND REACH OUT WITH MY HAND REACH DOWN WITH MY RIGHT HAND AND OUT
FOR EXAMPLE IN AND IT WAS THERE IS A LOT OF COLLOQUIUM ISMS THERE'S ALSO A WRITTEN ON TO THE RIGHT IN THE PLAY
A WHOLE HEEL FLIP THE TOE STAND RIGHT OUT AND WOULD WITHOUT
BUT THIS LAST SECTION IS LAST RECTANGLE RIGHT IN HERE THIS IS WHAT'S CALLED A MASTER OF BOTH
SO EVERY ACTIVITY DOWN TO HERE FROM PANNING AND LEFT OR RIGHT AND YOU SEE THAT RIGHT BID PANNING LIFT THE RIGHT
WE WILL TRY TO KEEP IT RIGHT ON THAT
I'M IT'LL WILL BLACK CIRCLES INSIDE THE BLUES CIRCLES DRAWN SOME EYEBROWS AND SOME EYELASHES IN A COUPLE LITTLE MARKS ON THE BEAT THERE AND THAT CREATES THE BASE OF THE DUCK RIGHT THERE
LEAVE IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW THE ARMS ARE RIGHT NOW
<UNK> RIGHT HERE I'M STRING ZERO TWO FOUR ZERO TWO FOUR ONE TWO IN THAT HE GOING UP THE SKILL YOU GET FOUR ONE TWO FOUR
SO FLIP IT RIGHT SIDE UP TO THIS NEW FIVE AND THEN IT GET AN AREA MOIST THAT CAN BE IN FAR ENOUGH TO BE AS SMALL AS THIS AND I'M SQUARE IS HERE
IT'S CALLED THE FROG KICK BACK IN SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU BRING YOUR HEEL STRAIGHT UP TO ABOUT RIGHT IN YOUR LEG IS STRAIGHT DOWN
THE OPPOSITE AN EDGE OF DIRT YOUR WHEELS THE OF THE RAT ON PROMOTION SITS RIGHT DOWN INSIDE THE HOLE
OR IS HE GIVING HER OF THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF ATTENTION
PERHAPS YOU WORK FOR SMALLER BUSINESS OR PERHAPS YOU WORK FOR AN EMPLOYER WHO DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUCH INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE RIGHT NOW
THAT'S WHERE IT IS RIGHT THERE
I THOUGHT SMALL THINS AN THIN FOR GENERAL ALL AROUND FREESTYLE ARE THROWN OUT FREE RIDE GIVE TO YOUR RIGHT BACK AND FORTH
THEY'RE NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT BUT THEY'VE NO ENOUGH THAT IF THEY HIT THAT IS GOOD OF A LOSER MENTAL FOCUS THEY CAN RUIN THE WHOLE ROUND RIGHT THERE
I LIKE TO DO THIS ONE ALSO RIGHT BEFORE IT ONCE THEY JUST OF LIFTER ENERGY BACKUP VACUUM I'VE COOLED OFF
OKAY THIS AWFUL COMBINATION WOMEN WHO IS DESERVES AM INTO SEVERAL DIFFERENT KINDS OF ANGLE LOSS IN THESE ANKLE LOCK COMBINATIONS OR MORE HUGE FACTOR IN THE THE INSTANCE THAT ONE SUBMISSION DOESN'T WORK YOU CAN FLOW RIGHT TO THE NEXT IT DOWN WITH WE'RE AND LOWER IT FOR THE NEXT
AND YOU CAN PICK THE LEAVES OF ONE BY ONE OR IF YOU GRAB ABOUT THREE QUARTERS THE WAY UP AND JUST PULL IT ALL THE LEAVES WILL COME RIGHT OFF
WHAT IT SHOULD HEATING BELOW MAY SHOULDN'T MEANS GOING RIGHT WAY
SO NOW I'VE ANOTHER HOCKEY HERE ACTUALLY THIS PARTICULAR AT AND YOU MAY NOT EVEN AMOUNT OF THE RIGHT AWAY I'VE JUST LIKE THE EIGHTIES THE HUMAN BABIES A ANTI THEY GROW A CHANGE CONSIDERABLY EIGHT WE STARTED OFF WITH A AT TWELVE DALE POPPY AND LOOK AT IT EIGHT LEGAL PUPPY AND NOW WE HAVE A MUCH OLDER PUPPY
YOU'LL SEE I HAVE A TRAILER UP ON MY ON SCREEN RIGHT NOW
IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO DRILL OUR PILOT HOLE IN THE CENTER OF THE BOWL WHICH IS GOING TO GIVE US THE DEPTH THAT WE WANT TO GO TO IS THAT WE DON'T CUT RIGHT TO THE BOTTOM
YOU'VE CALLED OR PRODUCER OR SESSION LEADER YOU GOT TOGETHER PICKED OUT THE KEYS THAT ARE RIGHT FOR YOU A YOU GONNA COME TO THE STUDIO GENERALLY SESSION STARTED TIN IN THE MORNING OR TWO IN THE AFTERNOON AND THAT YOU'RE GONNA COME AND THE MUSICIANS WILL ALL LOAD HIM GET SET UP A HALF
AND THAT WILL HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING YOUR VOCAL RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT WILL GET TO THAT LATER
SEE JUST A TURN YOUR BAG BACK RIGHT SIDE HOLE
SO IN THIS CASE RIGHT HERE WITH HIS BLUEBERRY PEACH FLYING IT'S CLEAR IS NOT HOBBLING ANYMORE SO IT'S READY TO TAKE A AND BOTTLE
I ACTUALLY TO ZOOM OR A UNION SNAP IT RIGHT OFF
SO THE SIFERS OUT TAKE THAT RIGHT
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT OF LIGHT PACE AND PLAN A HALF GAINS AT THE RIGHT TIME
AGAIN THIS TECHNIQUE AND PERFORM ON EITHER SIDE THAT SAYS SO RIGHT FOOT AND ONE AND TWO TO THREE IN FOR THE FACE AND YOUR ONE TOO THICK IT HAS LIKE THAT
NOW THIS TECHNIQUE EASILY HIM THE BLOCKING BLOCK THE LEFT HAND LIKE THIS SPIN THE WAIST OVER TO THE LAP DROP THE RIGHT LEG DOWN FOLLOW THROUGH WITH A HOOK KICK
WITH THIS TECHNIQUE OR SOON OPPONENT OF THE PUNCH OR THE LEFT IN BLOCK OR THE LEFT HAND AND SHOOT THE RIGHT LEG IN FRONT OF A HUMAN KICK LOWER LEG FIGURED IN A PASS BY A BRING THE RIGHT LEG AROUND AND HIT WITH THE HEEL OF ALL THE FOOT
THE LEVEL IN MY HE RIGHT HERE
BE PREPARED TO WAIT WEIGHTED OUT UNTIL YOU GET YOUR FIRST GOOD RIGHT
WHICH THIS I'LL BE EVEN WITH THE SIDE WITH THE THIRD AND THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE RIGHT THERE
ARMS WHILE ON A LETTUCES OF YELLOW CORN AND REALLY THE ACCORDION IS UP TO INSTRUMENTS JOINT RIGHT OUT
THESE AS LET THE MOHEE DROP HIS HIPS IN RIGHT THERE THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE HID FIDELITY
RIGHT HAND CASES YOU LEFT PAR FACES AWAY
SING THE WEIGHT INTO YOUR HIPS MORE WEIGHT ON THE RIGHT FOOT AND THE LEFT
THEY'LL LEARN TO DO IS WE JUST LOOKED THROUGH RELEASE THAT WITH OUR RIGHT FOOT FORWARD ON EIGHT OF A
TO GO AHEAD AND START AND DO A COUPLE BACK STITCHES TO CREATE A KNOT AND THEN JUST GO RIGHT ALONG THE SEAM WE WANTED TO BE NICE AND CLEAN IT UP AND CATCH BOTH ENDS
SO MY SEAM ON IS GOING TO BE RIGHT ALONG THE EDGE HERE
AND THAT IS SO IT RIGHT ALONG THE UNDERNEATH THE EDGE OF THE AROUND THE WAIST BAND HERE
I'M THE SO RIGHT HERE
YOUR LEFT FOOT IS IT'D BE IN THIS THEY'RE OUT AND YOUR RIGHT LAG IS GOING TO COME OVER ON TO THE OTHER SIDE OF OF WORMS
OUT WHICH ANY TO DO IS YOU NEED TO GET YOUR PHONE BOOK AND IN ONE FIND SEVERAL DIFFERENT UH DRIVEWAY PAPERS OR A CONCRETE GUYS IN YOUR AREA AND A NEW ONE RIGHT THOSE NINES THEN
SHE'S FROM A TROT THAT RIGHT NOW
I'M POLITICAL MORE WOULD DRAW OUR AGE RIGHT NOW
YOU CAN MAKE SURE EVERYTHING SLOW AND RIGHT OUT OF THE LAST STEAM WAND BINDERS CANNA PERSIAN AND INTO A TOWEL
AND THE RIGHT HANDING AND PSI
SO HERE WE CAN COME UP THIS WAY WITH NO ENGLISH THIS WAY WITH RIGHT HAND ENGLISH AND THIS WAY WITH LEFT IN ENGLISH
IT'S FLIP THIS SYSTEM AND THEN I SIT ON RIGHT HERE
UH SO I DON'T HAVE TO HANDLE IT ON THE SKIN OF PRESS RECORD BUTTON AND A HOME AND JUST LEAVE IT IN THE RIGHT FRAMING AND GLITTER ON TOP
IN THIS CASE WE'VE GOT FOURTEEN TWENTY WHICH IS JUST RIGHT FOR THIS PARTICULAR GLAZE
AND THEN JUST DROP THIS RIGHT IN HERE GENTLY AND LET IT FALL UNTIL IT STOPS FALLING
AND THEN MAKING SURE THAT THE BUTTERFLY AS FLAT AND THE BODY IS FLAT AND HOPEFULLY COMES RIGHT TO THE ON EDGE OF THE CONSTRUCTION PAPER WITH AND BRINGS DAIGLER AND AGAIN AND GO IN AND AN ANGLE AND ATTACH IT THERE
LEATHER NOW IS BRING IT IN AND WE WANT TO CATCH IT RIGHT HERE ON HAVE WHAT BETWEEN THE HEAD AND THE BODY WITH THE FULL
RIGHT THERE IS WHERE WE WANT AND NEED AS OPPOSED TO WAY OVER HERE
<UNK> THEORY ON AS OUT RIGHT CLICK ON VIEW THE THIGH AND OF THREE THIN LINE AND THE WITH <UNK>
SOMEONE GETS RIGHT ON YOU
WHAT I HAVE RIGHT BEHIND IT IS YOUR TYPICAL WHEN A TIMELY
WE ALWAYS PUT LAYERS OF THING SO THAT CAN HELP COVER ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW
AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE COPYRIGHT INFORMATION AND THE WIZARD OF THE GOES INCORPORATED YOU'LL FIND A COUPLE MORE NUMBERS
THE FIRST NUMBER THAT YOU COME ACROSS FROM RIGHT TO LEFT IS THE CARDS STAPLE NUMBER
SO WHAT I'M INTO AN CLOSE YOUR EYES IS ON MANY USE THAT COLOR RIGHT ON HER LEAD AND I'M JUST KIND OF PRESS IT RIGHT IN AND I'M KNOTS WHITE BEING THE BRUSH BECAUSE ESPECIALLY WITH MORE OF A PIGMENTED COLOR IF YOU SWIPE IT YOUR SOMETIMES CAN GET THAT FALL DOWN DOWN HERE AND WE REALLY WANT AVOID BACK IS WE'VE ALREADY WORKED ON HER EYE MAKEUP OR ON HER SKIN SKINNY
SO BLENDER RIGHT INTO THE SKIN AND THEN IF YOU NEED TO GO BACK AND GET THE SAME BRUSH THE U.S FREER CREASE COLOR YOU CAN DO THAT SO IT BLENDS EVERYTHING IN TOGETHER AND YOU CAN SEE HOW PRETTY THAT IS
YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT THE FULCRUM HOW THE FULCRUM WORKS MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT NUMBER FOR WHEN YOU WENT DIVE OFF THE BOARD
AND THEN A CRADLE MY RIGHT ELBOW TO MY BODY IN A MINUTE PULL THIS ARM BACK OR MY SHOULDER
SO FROM THIS POSITION WHEN THEY DO IS I'M GOING TO USE THE WEDGE OF MY HAND AND I'M GETTING HIT IT RIGHT INTO MELISSA'S WRIST BONE ARE CARE
OR RIGHT ON THE BEND OF IT
WHEN WE LAY ALL DOWN CAN AGAIN SEE THEM REALLY OCTAVES MY FINGERS NOT LETTING THEM TOUCHING THE STRINGS RIGHT NEXT TO THEM
TELL THEM THAT THE SEAM OR THE COVER ALWAYS GOES TO THE LEFT AND YOU CAN TEACH IN THE LEFT AND RIGHT HANDS AT THE SAME TIME THAT SO THAT THEY DON'T TAKE THE BOOK AND START FROM THE BACK WHICH IS VERY NATURAL AND THEY WOULD EVEN PUT IT UPSIDE DOWN IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FACT THAT THE PICTURE WOULD BE UPSIDE DOWN
AND THE OUTSIDE OPPOSITE SIDE AS WELL THE B OF EVEN THE ANY PART OF THE STICK RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE BALL IS GOING TO BE INSIDE AGAINST THE MILK CARTON SO YOU REALLY WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT'S EVEN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING THE STICK DIRTY WHILE YOU'RE PAINTING IT
FOLD ONE OF THE SECTIONS TO THE RIGHT SO WE STILL HAVE FOUR SECTIONS ON BOTH SIDES
<UNK> RIGHT INTO THE FROM YOU
IN THIS CASE IT'S GOING TO BE RIGHT THERE AND I'M GOING TO TAKE MY PIN TOOL SIMPLY MARKET
I MEAN IT'S DEFINITELY A GREAT THING TO HAVE GOING ON OVER THEIR TIME AND THEN OTHER THAN ACTIVE WE DO A LOT OF TIME IN PARKS IT CAN ON CHROME BALLS WHICH HAVE GOTTEN WILL PLAY AREAS AND WHEN IT'S COOLED OR RIGHT OUT
IT DEALS FIRST RIGHT DAMAGE AND COMMENTING
FOR THOSE IT AND BE THREE THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE PURCHASING A TURN OUT LIKE A SO THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU GETTING THE MOST BANG FOR YOUR BUTT AND IF YOU PURCHASE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE RIGHT FOR YOUR ELEMENTS AND CLIMATE AND YOUR HORSE
HEY INNOMINATE GOING OF THAT NEXT LITTLE PINK ON HOW THE CHEEK SMILE AN X AND JUST START WITH THE APPLES WHICH IS RIGHT HERE AND THEN YOU'RE IN A FULLY OR RUSH THAT RIGHT ALONG THE CHEEKBONE ANDS BLENDED DAN AND THEN I'M IN A DO A LITTLE THE LIGHT HIGHLIGHT RATE I'M SOMETIMES CAN SLEEPING RESCH BACK AND FORTH COUPLE TIMES ON THE TOP OF THE CHEEKBONE
NORMALLY GOING IN CONTOUR HER FACE LITTLE THE ADULT LUSTER HER CHEEKS UP SOME IS TAKE A LITTLE PRONGS COLOR AND A BLUSH FRESH ANIMAL LATELY SWEEP IT JUST RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE CHEEKBONE IN MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A LINE
THAT'S RIGHT THIRTY SECONDS AND THEN THEY START TO THINK ABOUT THEIR MOST FAVORITE SUBJECT AND THAT IS THEMSELVES
AND JUST SORT OF SORTED GET HIM UNDERNEATH THERE AND THEN SHE SHOULD JUST POP IT RIGHT OUT
IF IT IS THE SHOES RIGHT DOWN HERE AT WHICH WOULD DO IS SORT OF PUSH THEM DOWN AND WITH YOUR FINGER ACROSS
IT WOULD MAKE SURE THE CONDITIONERS RINSED OUT REALLY WELL BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T RINSE THE CONDITIONER OUT WELL WELL ENOUGH THEN THE COLOR HAS NOTHING TO APPLY TO IT WILL JUST SLIDE RIGHT OFF
WE WANT OUR RIGHT HAND IT'S ON THE PLACE MY HAND BEHIND THE BALL A SUCH INTO THE GROOVE
EXTENDING YOUR TAIL BONE RIGHT DOWN INTO THE EARTH AND THEN LENGTHENING UP THROUGH THE CROWN OF THE HEAD IN INHALING IN AND THEN AS SHE EXHALES SHE ROTATE INTO THAT LINK JUST A LITTLE BIT DEEPER
RIGHT SO THIS MISSED AND THIS MACHINE AND DOES HEAT UP THE WANTING TO WRITE A WRITTEN AGREES IN ITS AND IT'S AN STABILIZING IF THEY'RE SO THAT'S GOOD AND THAT'S EXACTLY IT WHERE I WANTED
THE WAY THAT I'LL TEST THAT RIGHT NOW IS BY TURNING ON THE GROUP HEAD IN LONDON WATER FLOW TO HEAR A THERMOMETER
LOOKS LIKE I SET MY FEET RIGHT IS BY GUESSING THERE AND I LIKE TO RUN A SEVENTY THREE AND A QUARTER OF SEVEN THREE POINT TO FIVE MILLIMETER SEAT HEIGHT AND THAT'S THE THAT WE GOT
THE BEST WAY TO MEASURE SEAT HEIGHT IS THE TAPE MEASURE IF MEASURING IT CONSISTENTLY FROM THE CENTER OF THE BOTTOM BRACKET WHICH IS THAT HOLE RIGHT THERE TO THE CENTER THE SEAT TUBE
SO YOU COULD LEAVE A LITTLE LIKE THIS AND TO CUT IN HALF SO ENJOY THE IS FIND THE SPOT RIGHT HERE AND THE RIB CAGE
AND THE THING THAT WE USE IN OR A SUPER SHORT KNIFE IF YOU'VE GOT A OUT YET CLEAVER SEATED HEAVY USE THAT SO THAT IF THE HECK INTO A RIGHT THERE
THIS WOULD PULL THIS PART RIGHT HERE UP IN IT WHICH ARE TRYING TO DO YOU TRYING TO BREAK BACK BUT RIGHT HERE SO IT WAS MARK EACH SIDE FOR WHAT THE SNAP THAT NATURE HISTORY
ENTERED IN ONE MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE OPENED JUST ENOUGH OF A OF AN OPENING THAT YOU CAN TURN YOUR PLACE THAT RIGHT SIDE OUT
AND THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FABRIC IS OFF OF THE THE FRONT
AND PUT THE RIGHT SIDE OF BOTH FABRICS THAT YOU'RE IN THE U.S TOGETHER LIKE THAT
RIGHT NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR VOICE
SO AGAIN TO US IF IF IS THE RACKET IS PUSHES THE BALL RIGHT ABOVE THE TIN
SO WE HAVE THE RACKET SO THAT IT IS A GREAT SHOT IN YOUR VIRTUALLY OF DEN WRONG AND HIT IT COME IN AND YOU PUT THE RACKET I'LL AND YOU GET RIGHT UNDERNEATH IT
NOW WHAT I'M ACTUALLY DOING ISN'T SPINNING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE STICK GETTING IT OUTSIDE SPIN ON THE TASSEL TAKING MY LEG OVER LETTING THE STICK JUST ROLL OVER MY LEG LIKE THAT AND BACK OUT TO MY RIGHT CONTROL STICK JUST LIKE THAT
NOW TO WORK ON THIS YOU HAVE TO GET THIS CATCH DOWN A YOU'D HAVE TO BE USED TO KICK YOUR LEG UP AND CATCHING THE UP UNDERSIDE OF THE CRYSTAL STICK ON OR TIE THE TOP SIDE THE CRYSTAL STICK ON THE UNDERSIDE OF YOUR LEG AT THE RIGHT BALANCE POINT THAT JUST BINS OVER NICE AND EASY LIKE THAT
AT THE RIGHT FOOT
AND I KNEW ONE KEEP IT RIGHT UNDERNEATH YOUR SOUTHWARD DEATH EVEN ANGLE OF BELOW THE KNEE OKAY AT THE WHOLE LENGTH
FROM HERE I'M IN A BRING THE FOOT DOWN STEP OUT BOW RIGHT HAND PERFORM SCRAPING BLOCK AND IN THE BODY SNAPS INTO SIDE PUNCH
THE COUNTRIES OR A RUFFLE LOOK BY GOING LIKE THIS RIGHT ALONG THE EDGES HE MIGHT MAT
AND WHAT THAT'LL DO LITTLE RIGHT DOWN A LOT OF THE THE SERVICE VARNISH AND ACTUALLY FRESHEN UP AND TAKE OFF SOME OF THE AGE OF STAIN THAT OF ALSO ON THIS WELL SO THAT WE CAN REVEAL LAVA WOOD GRAIN
WHEN WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT RULES AND HOW IT IS PLAYED HOW DOES ON PLAYED BY THE RULES SO YOU KNOW HOW TO GET RIGHT
AND LIKE THIS ONE WHICH CAN REALLY THIN RIGHT HERE
YOU DON'T MOUSE OR BE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE
