IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SPEND A COMPLETE ONE EIGHTY BECAUSE ONCE YOU START LEARNING AND YOU'LL CARRY MUCH BETTER SPEED RIDING OUT BACKWARDS IF YOU SPIN IT REALLY A COMPLETE ONE EIGHTY RATHER THAN SPINNING NO HUNDREDS SIXTY DEGREES OR SO WHERE YOU BASICALLY ARE GOING TO LAND IN A COMPLETE STOP
WHICH ARE FOUND IN THE TOP HERE IN YOUR FINGERS IN THE BACK OF FOLD OVER THE TOP OF THE CUFF SPREADING OUT YOUR FINGERS AS YOU PULL THEM OUT LAND

ONE IS THE RECORD LAND
SO ALTHOUGH I DON'T LIKE GLOCK <UNK> FOR OVERLY FAKE LAND OR FISH CHATTER IF YOU DO IT TO THICKEN IT A LITTLE BIT
WE'RE HERE IN THE REAR HOUSING IN A BRING IN ON I'M THINK IF THE HAND YOU JUMP RIGHT LAND IN A PAN AND AN A
HOWEVER THIS CARD DOES IS IT DESTROYS FUN OF LAND
ONCE AGAIN WITHOUT A LAND THAT MEANS THAT PERSON HAS TO PLAN OF THE LAND BUT ALSO MEANS THAT THEY DON'T GET THAT MANNER
JUST BEFORE YOU GET TO THE END THAT SUGGEST ABOUT SIX INCHES TO WITH AUTHORITY AND THINK <UNK> JUST IF AND THE AND THE FRONT SIDE ONE EIGHTY OUT AND LAND FAKIE AND ROLL LENGTH
