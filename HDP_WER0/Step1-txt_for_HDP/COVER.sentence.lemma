YOU'RE GOING TO OPEN UP THE INSIDE ARM IS OPEN THE BALL'S GOING TO GO IN YOU'RE GOING TO COVER THE BALL WITH BOTH TIPS AND HOLD ON TO IT TIGHT STAYING LOW IN ORDER TO EXPLODE THROUGH THE HOLE
ONCE THE BALL GOES INSIDE HE WANTS TO WRAP THE BALL UP TIGHT AND COVER IT WITH BOTH TIPS OVER THE BALL
WE'RE GOING TO SET THAT ASIDE AND IF WE TAKE THAT COVER BACK DOWN AND PUT BACK OVER IT'LL HOLD THE BOLT IN THERE AND KEEP THEM TOGETHER WHILE IT'S NOT BEING USED
OKAY IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO COVER REMOVING THE DRIVER'S SIDE SEATBELT FASTENERS AND BASICALLY THEY'RE FASTENED WITH TWO BOLTS AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE A SEVENTEEN MILLIMETER HEAD

YOU JUST WANT TO COVER THE FACE AND MAKEUP
THEY COVER YOUR ARMS HIGHER I DON'T LIKE TO GET SPLASHES UP MY ARMS
WE'VE ATTACHED OUR TUNER COVER WE HAVEN'T AFFECTED THE WOOD IT'S LOOKING GOOD
IT'S JUST A COUPLE OF INCHES BUT IT DOES COVER JUST ENOUGH TO COVER WHAT WE NEED TO COVER
THE REASON I WOULD NOT WANT TO MOUNT A PHOTO IS IF IT IS AN ORIGINAL OR IF I WAS PLANNING ON PUTTING IT UNDER GLASS OR IF THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE BACK OF THIS POSTER FOR SOME REASON THAT I DID NOT WANT TO COVER THIS UP ESPECIALLY ORIGINALS YOU DO NOT WANT TO MOUNT ON A POSTER
IT DOES SHOW YOUR BOTTOM BUT IT HAS A COVER
ONCE YOU MULCH IT IN THEN WE WILL WANT TO COVER IT BACK UP TO KEEP THE RABBITS AND BUNNIES OUT OF COURSE

HERE WE SEE THE FIRST THING THAT COMES UP IS THE COVER AND IF WE SCROLL DOWN WE SEE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE TEXT OF THE BOOK AS IT APPEARS IN THE ORIGINAL BOOK
SO YOU JUST WANNA KIND OF PAT IT INTO THE SKIN SO IT WILL COVER WHERE YOU NEED IT WILL COVER
OR SOME PEOPLE WILL LIKE TO USE SPONGE THIS IS JUST A PLAYTEX FREE SPONGE WEDGE AND YOU CAN USE THAT TO PAT AND COVER
THE REASON THAT I NEED IT IS BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE PUTTING SOME GOLD METAL FASTENERS INTO THE CARDBOARD TO HELP ME FASTEN THE BACK OF THE PICTURE FRAME AND THEN I'M GOING TO COVER IT WITH MASKING TAPE
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU PULL THE GUARD YOU HAVE A RUNNING BACK COMING THROUGH OR THAT THE TACKLE KNOWS THAT HE HAS TO COVER OR WE HAVE A TIGHT END CRACKING DOWN ETC
TRY TO RESTORE SOME OF THAT GROUND COVER BACK THE WAY IT WAS AND IF YOU MOVED LOGS IF YOU USED LOGS TO SIT ON AROUND THE CAMPFIRE IF YOU USED THEM TO SIT ON AS CAMP STOOLS TRY TO MOVE THOSE BACK TO WHERE YOU FOUND THEM OR PUT THEM BACK OUT IN THE WOODS SO THEY'RE NOT IN AN OBVIOUS PATTERN THAT YOU'VE CREATED
NOW WE TALKED ABOUT RUBBER STAMPS BUT ANOTHER METHOD OF USING WAX TO COVER AN IMAGE IS WITH PHOTOGRAPHY
YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THIS SIDE OF THE HATCH COVER IS BEVELED AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT'S PUT BACK IN SO THAT THE BEVEL IS POINTING DOWN ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOAT OR OUTSIDE OF THE CABIN

I HAD TO COVER MY HEAD
TELL THEM THAT THE SEAM OR THE COVER ALWAYS GOES TO THE LEFT AND YOU CAN TEACH THEM THEIR LEFT AND RIGHT HANDS AT THE SAME TIME SO THAT THEY DON'T TAKE THE BOOK AND START IT FROM THE BACK WHICH IS VERY NATURAL AND THEY WOULD EVEN PUT IT UPSIDE DOWN IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FACT THAT THE PICTURE WOULD BE UPSIDE DOWN
A POLISH BRUSH IS WIDE ENOUGH TO COVER MOST OF A NAIL IN THREE STROKES
I TAKE MY KNIFE AND I USE THE VERY SHARP PART OF IT BECAUSE IT WILL JUST POKE HOLES BUT I USE THAT TO KIND OF SEPARATE IT AND TUCK IT DOWN IN BETWEEN THAT PART OF THE HARD COVER AND WHERE THE PAGES ARE
THERE'S A SPACE HERE BETWEEN THE HARD COVER ON THE BACK AND YOU SEE THIS YELLOW RIBBON WHICH IS WHAT IS HOLDING THE PAGES TOGETHER
