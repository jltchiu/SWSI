HI MY NAME IS BRANDON SARKIS ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE.  TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE HOLIDAY PUDDING.  OKAY SO NOW YOU CAN SEE THAT WE'VE GOT A MIXTURE THAT LOOKS KIND OF LIKE LOOKS LIKE MUFFIN BATTER ACTUALLY.  SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR MOLASSES NOW AND WE'RE GOING TO ADD ALL OF THAT IN AT ONCE.  AND YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE YOUR SPATULA AROUND.  AND IT DOESN'T MATTER MY SPATULA HAS GOT FLOUR ON IT ALREADY BECAUSE BECAUSE IT'S ALL THE SAME MIXTURE.  YOU KNOW IF THIS WERE A DIFFERENT INGREDIENT I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY GET A DIFFERENT SPATULA.  BUT SINCE ALL THAT'S IN THERE IS THE YOU KNOW ALL THAT THE SPATULA'S TOUCHED IS EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE PRODUCT OR EVERYTHING IS ALREADY IN THE END PRODUCT IT REALLY MAKES NO DIFFERENCE.  SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET ALL OF YOUR MOLASSES THERE WE GO.  THAT IS ALL OF MY MOLASSES.  AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO RAISE THE BOWL BACK UP AND SLOWLY STIR THAT IN.  AND IT MAKES KIND OF A GOOPY MESS.  AND IT'S GOING TO END UP LOOKING LIKE A KIND OF LIKE A REALLY DARK THICK RUNNY LIKE PANCAKE BATTER ALMOST.  YOU WANT IT TO REACH THE RIGHT TEXTURE AND CONSISTENCY.  LET'S TURN IT UP A LITTLE BIT.  OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO LET THIS GO UNTIL THERE ARE NO LUMPS IN IT WHICH WILL PROBABLY TAKE SEVERAL MINUTES.  SO I WILL COME BACK WHEN IT'S REACHED THAT POINT AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT STEP THEN.  OKAY SO IT'S BEEN A FEW MINUTES.  YOU CAN SEE THAT WE'VE GOT NO LUMPS IN THERE TO SPEAK OF.  SO NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS I'VE ALREADY SCRAPED IT DOWN TOO I'M JUST GOING TO VERY SLOWLY ADD MY MILK IN.  I'M TALKING LIKE AT A TRICKLE.  AND WHAT THIS IS DOING IS
AS WE TAKE THE PARTS OFF WE WANT TO LAY THEM OUT SO THEY STAY IN THE SAME FORMAT BECAUSE THERE'S A CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER THEY OVERLAP OTHER PLASTIC PARTS AND IF WE KEEP THEM IN THAT ORDER THE REASSEMBLY PHASE WILL BE A LOT LESS CONFUSING A LOT LESS CHANCE WE END UP WITH SOME OVERLAPPING LABOR I.E
FIRST ONE YOU JUST TAKE A FEW LITTLE THREADS UP AND YOU CAN LEAVE A LITTLE BIT HANGING OFF THE END BECAUSE YOU'LL EVENTUALLY CUT THOSE OFF ANYWAY
A REAL HIGH END COLLECTION OF MICROPHONES
THE ONLY TIME THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM IS IF YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING REAL DETAILED SAY A FACE OR SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT THOSE LITTLE BLOBS TO END UP ON THERE THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE HARD TO GET OFF WITH THAT KIND OF DETAIL
WE WERE DOING STORIES THAT HAD A BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END ALL IN 22 PAGES
SO BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO AT THIS POINT IS KIND OF FOLD IN ANY PARTS THAT ARE HANGING OUT AT THE END THAT YOU MAYBE WANT TO BRING BACK IN TO YOUR BUBBLE WRAP ROLL
WE WANT TO GET THE DETAILS SO WE END UP DOING THEM IN SCALE AS WELL
AND NINETY POUND ESPECIALLY NEEDS TO BE STRETCHED BECAUSE AFTER YOU'VE GOTTEN IT ALL WET IT WILL BE VERY WAVY AND YOU WON'T END UP WITH A SMOOTH SURFACE
MOST OF THEM ARE EQUIPPED WITH A BALL BEARING TYPE SWIVEL AT THE VERY END SO THAT MAKES THEM A LITTLE BIT FASTER AND THE JUMP ROPE ITSELF DOESN'T GET BALLED UP INSIDE THE HANDLE
AND THEN AT THE END OF THE GAME YOU CAN ALSO SO OK EVERYBODY HAS TO PULL OUT THE ONE MOST RANDOM ITEM THAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR PURSE
IT'S ON THIS END AND ON THE B STRING IT'S ON THIS END
YOU LEAVE IT AT THE START AND YOU ARE GOING TO END UP RIGHT BACK THERE AT THE END
WHAT THEY DO IS THEY DO THE SAME TYPES OF MOVEMENTS BUT DUE TO THE WEIGHT BEING A LITTLE BIT HEAVIER ON ONE END IT MAKES YOUR FLOWERS AND THE DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES A LOT FASTER AND THOSE ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STAFFS
IN THIS STEP I AM GOING TO DEMONSTRATE THE PROPER JACKING PROCEDURE FOR GETTING THE FRONT END OF OUR TRUCK UP SO WE CAN FIT UNDERNEATH TO CHANGE OUR TRANSFER CASE FLUID
AND THEN WE'LL COMP OR COMPILE THE VOCAL MEANING WE'RE GOING TO TAKE LINES THE BEST LINES FROM EACH PASS THAT WE'VE SAVED AND PUT TOGETHER A REALLY SOLID VOCAL PERFORMANCE FROM BEGINNING TO END
THAT'S SOMETIMES HARD BECAUSE IT'S REAL EASY TO DROP OFF THE EDGE AND WE END UP WITH OUR HAND IN THE GRINDER
QUITE OFTEN IT'S BEST TO DO THIS IN THE EVENING TOWARD THE END OF YOUR DAY
IT'S A GREAT NAME FOR THE GAME AND EVERYBODY WHO COMES IN IS GOING TO GET SOME SORT OF A NECKLACE OR A PIN YOU CAN USE A LEI YOU CAN USE A STRAND OF BEADS ANOTHER GREAT WAY IS TO GIVE EVERYBODY A LITTLE NECKLACE WITH A BELL ON THE END ANYTHING LIKE THAT IS GOING TO WORK
AT THE END OF THE BRIDAL SHOWER THE PERSON WHO HAS THE MOST NECKLACES OR PINS WHATEVER YOU'RE USING IS GOING TO BE THE WINNER OF THAT GAME AND THEY'RE GOING TO GET A PRIZE
TO CLEAN THE AQUARIUM PUT THE END OF THE HOSE IN THE BUCKET DIP THE BELL OF THE SIPHON INTO THE WATER AND LIFT IT OUT LET THE WATER DRAIN DOWN AND DROP IT BACK IN THIS WILL START THE SIPHON
AFTER YOUR CHILD HAS BEEN MASTERING BLENDS FOR A WHILE MAYBE A COUPLE OF WEEKS MAYBE A LITTLE MORE WHATEVER YOU THINK AND THAT YOU'VE MADE THEM SOME NICE BOOKS AND WORKSHEETS USING BLENDS AND END BLENDS TWO IN THE BEGINNING TWO IN THE END WE'RE GOING TO START HAVING DOUBLE BLENDS AND TRIPLE BLENDS
NOW DOUBLE BLENDS ARE WHEN YOU HAVE A BLEND IN THE BEGINNING AND THE END TWO CONSONANTS TWO CONSONANTS AND JUST ONE VOWEL IN THE MIDDLE
HOWEVER FOR SMALLER TYPES OF BRAIDS YOU MAY WANT TO USE A END OF A RATTAIL COMB AND GET IT LOOSE UNTIL IT IS COMPLETELY UPBRAIDED
NEXT BEGIN AT THE END OR BOTTOM OF THE PLAT AND BEGIN UNRAVELING
AND WE JUST CLIP IT ON TO THE VERY END
IF YOU START IN MAINE AND END UP IN GEORGIA OR YOU CAN START IN GEORGIA AND GO ALL THE WAY UP THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAIN RANGE INTO MAINE
AND BE CAREFUL BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY SHARP ON THE END
SO YOU WANT TO TAKE THE END OF THE STRING
SO THE FIRST STEP IS JUST TO STICK THE END OF THE STRING
THE WAY YOU START THAT THAT WAY I START THAT IS I MAKE A LITTLE LOOP LIKE THIS TWIST IT AROUND ONE MORE TIME AND THEN TAKE THE END THROUGH THE TOP OF THAT LOOP
SO THEN NOW THAT THE KNOT'S SET UP YOU TAKE YOUR LOOSE END AND YOU'RE GOING TO THREAD IT THROUGH YOUR HARNESS THROUGH BOTH THE LEG LOOPS IN THE TOP
TO WIDEN YOUR STANCE FIND THE PRE-MARKED FACTORY HOLES AND GO AS FAR AWAY FROM THEM AS YOU CAN TOWARDS EITHER END OF THE BOARD
IT MAY NOT ACTUALLY GO FLAT UNTIL YOU GET OUT ON THE ROAD AND IT ACTUALLY HAS SOME SERIOUS PRESSURE UNDER IT AND THEN YOU'LL END UP FIXING ANOTHER FLAT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THAT'S NO GOOD
ONCE YOUR TUBE IS IN THERE ALL THE WAY GO AHEAD AND THEN REINSTALL YOUR TIRE THE REST OF THE WAY MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING ONLY YOUR HANDS BECAUSE IF YOU DO TRY TO USE A SCREWDRIVER OR EVEN A TIRE LEVER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU CAN END UP PINCHING YOUR TUBE BETWEEN THE TIRE AND THE RIM WHICH IS THEN CALLED A PINCH FLAT
AND ONCE WE REMOVE THE MASK FROM HER BACK WE'RE GOING TO END THE TREATMENT NOW WITH A LITTLE SPRITZ OF A TONER AND THIS IS JUST REFRESHING FOR THE SKIN AND JUST TO ADD TO TIGHTEN UP THE PORES AND CLOSE EVERYTHING DOWN AND YOU JUST WANT TO GENTLY STROKE HER BACK AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT THE PRODUCT IS NICE AND ABSORBED
IN THE END IT'S GOING TO COME OUT NICE AND STRAIGHT
WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO GET YOUR CARBIDE TIP BIT PUT IT ON THE END OF YOUR SCREW GUN LIKE THIS AND THEN YOU WANT TO MARK WHERE YOU WANT YOUR HOLE TO BE
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A HIGHER END PAINT THAT'S USUALLY A WATER BASED A LOT THICKER THE EASE OF GETTING IT OFF IS GOING TO REALLY DEPEND ON HOW LONG IT'S BEEN ON THERE
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO ADD TOO MUCH OATMEAL OR YOU COULD END UP DRYING YOUR SKIN OUT
THIS IS GOING TO BE KIND OF A SWEET BERRY LIKE PEPPER AND WE'LL ADD ALL OF THAT TOGETHER AND THAT'S THE SAUCE WE'RE GOING TO POUR OVER THE TOP AT THE END
THAT'S BECAUSE I FORGOT TO CLOSE OUT MY FONT BRACKET AT THE END OF THIS PARAGRAPH
WE WOULD JUST GO IN HERE AND DO FONT FACE = YOU KNOW LET'S DO COURIER COMMA OOPS FORGOT THE EQUALS COURIER COMMA COURIER NEW AND END THAT
A LITTLE STRAIGHT ON THE TOP AND A LITTLE CURVED AND TAPERING OFF ON THE BOTTOM AND I'M GOING TO PUT SOME GLUE THERE SOME GOOD THICKNESS OF GLUE THERE AND WE'LL PUT THAT ON THE TAIL END OF OUR DRAGON
BECAUSE THAT'S THE END QUALITY
BUT ONE OF THOSE THINGS THOSE INSTRUCTORS MIGHT HAVE SAID TO YOU IS OUT OF ABOUT THIRTY OF YA OUT THERE RIGHT NOW THERE MIGHT BE THREE THAT END UP BEING GREAT REALTORS
I'M GOING TO TAKE OFF MY END TAGS
IF I DO TAKE OF THE END TAGS ON THESE TWO PARAGRAPHS IT WILL JUSTIFY ALL THREE OF THESE PARAGRAPHS TOGETHER
AND JUST YOU CAN POKE IT THROUGH WITH THE BLUNT END OF THE SCISSORS AND PULL THAT OUT TO ABOUT HALF WAY BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN JUST WEAVE IT IN AND OUT OF YOUR SLITS POKING THROUGH THE HOLES
I PREFER WHEN I START MY WEAVING I LIKE TO START IN THE MIDDLE BECAUSE THE STRIP IS SO LONG IT'LL BE A LITTLE BIT SHORTER IF WE START IN THE MIDDLE AND GO FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER END
BUT I'VE GOT THE OTHER END ON THE INSIDE NOW
SO WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO IS HE IS GOING TO STEP HIS RIGHT FOOT FORWARD AND THEN HE IS GOING TO SWING HIS LEG BACK TRYING TO KICK HIMSELF IN THE REAR END WITH HIS HEEL
IT IS JUST A SHORT BARBELL WITH TWO BEADS ON THE END
HALF RHINO AND HALF ARMADILLO IS WHAT THIS GUY IS GOING TO KIND OF END UP LOOKING LIKE
NOW IF YOU JUST WATCH MY BEAT MATCHING THE SEGMENT BEAT MATCHING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOL IN TRANSITIONING BUT YOU DO NOT NEED TO BEAT MATCH TO CHANGE THIS END
TO MY MIND IT'S A LOT LIKE YOU PUT A DVD AND THAT YOU WANT TO WATCH AND THEN YOU FAST FORWARD TO THE END OKAY
AND YOU'LL PUT A LITTLE MORE PAINT TOWARDS THE END OF YOUR BRISTLES
SO YOU HAVE ONES LIKE THIS WHERE YOU HAVE FIGURES THAT END UP SAWING UP THERE AS AS VARIOUS GERMAN FOLK TUNES PLAY AND THE BIRD POPS OUT AND WATER WHEELS TURN
YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO HAVE THE ISSUES OF CLINGINESS OR STICKINESS FROM YOUR BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND AND BE MUCH HAPPIER AT THE END OF THE DAY
ALSO DEFENSIVELY IT WILL ENABLE YOUR TEAM TO GO DOWN OFFENSIVELY AND SCORE AT THE OTHER END
WHICH IS BASICALLY THE FRONT END IF YOU GO TO BIT TORRENT.COM THAT'S PITTORRENT.COM/DOWNLOAD FROM HERE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE BIT TORRENT CLIENT THIS IS THE OFFICIAL BIT TORRENT CLIENT USE CAN USE THIS HOWEVER THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT CLIENTS YOU CAN USE IF YOU GO TO DESSEND.NET/BTFAQ THE SITE THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT IN THE LAST TUTORIAL SCROLL DOWN YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A PART IN THE FAQ CALLED WHERE CAN I DOWNLOAD THE BIT TORRENT PROGRAM AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CLIENTS DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOUR USING WINDOWS OR WHETHER YOU HAVE A MACK AND YOU'RE USING OSX THERE'S A GOOD DOZEN OR SO JUST STICK COMES DOWN PREFERENCE IF SAY IF YOUR USING SHAREAZA OR SOME OTHER PIER TO PIER SOFTWARE THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER YOU CAN ALSO USE THOSE TO DOWNLOAD TORRENTS WITH OR YOU CAN EVEN I'M IN OPERA RIGHT NOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY DOWNLOAD TORRENTS THROUGH OPERA AND I BELIEVE FIREFOX BUT THEY DON'T REALLY GIVE YOU THE CONTROL OF OVER THE TORRENTS AND THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION YOUR GOING TO KNOW WHAT ABOUT AND WHEN YOUR USING TORRENTS
MY PERSONAL FAVORITE CLIENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THROUGHOUT TUTORIALS IS AZARIUS THIS IS THE FRONT END THAT I USE
YOU WILL BE USING THE SKEW TO SMOOTH THE WORK DOWN MAKE VEE CUTS CUT BEADS SQUARE OFF THE END OF THE STOCK
YOU FOLD THE TOE END HALFWAY OVER THEN YOU FOLD THE CUFF END OVER
AND IN THIS CASE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A ROPE CLIPPED IN TO THE BACK HERE AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE DIVING OUT ATTACHED TO THE END OF THAT ROPE WITH SOMEONE ON SHORE HOLDING THE END
IT IS MADE OUT OF METAL OBVIOUSLY AND HAS A RING ON EACH END
IT'S EASY TO GET IN TO THIS POSITION BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS BY ROLLING BACKWARDS WITH TOO MUCH SPEED AND YOU END UP LOCKING OVER
SO THE BOTTOMS ARE COOKED A LITTLE BIT LONGER THE TOPS WILL GO IN AT THE END
TAKE THE OTHER END OF YOUR Q-TIP TAKE YOUR RINSE WATER AND RINSE IT OFF AND SET IT SOMEPLACE TO DRY
IT'S ALSO GOOD FOR GETTING PEOPLE PHYSICALLY WARMED UP BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO BE MOVING BY THE END OF THIS EXERCISE
AS YOU COME TO THE END OF A ROW OF ANY PROJECT WE WILL FINISH OUT OUR ROW WITH WHATEVER STITCH WE'RE DOING
AND THAT'S A REALLY COMMON THING FOR PEOPLE TO DO AND I USED TO DO THAT TOO BUT A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU DO THAT IT PUSHES THE LIP COLOR OUT AND YOU END UP HAVING TO APPLY IT MANY MORE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY SO TRY TO JUST GET USED TO PRESSING TOGETHER GO AHEAD AND PRESS AGAIN AND IT'S GOING TO HELP TO BLEND ALL THAT COLOR TOGETHER BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO MOVE YOUR GLOSS
I FIND RIGHT NEAR THE END OF THE FINGERBOARD IS COMFORTABLE
SO AGAIN LAST TWO YOU MUST HAVE THE DEUCES OR CARDS TO GET OFF LEAD TOWARD THE END OF THE HAND
AND THAT'S HOW TO CHOOSE A HIGH END CHESS SET
IN OTHER WORDS YOU DON'T WANT TO END UP WITH LETTERS THAT LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE TYPE THAT YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST USE TYPE
BUT OVERALL IT'S VERY REWARDING BECAUSE YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT YOU'RE HELPING SOMEBODY OR EDUCATING SOMEBODY AND YOU'RE ENABLING SOMEBODY TO HAVE A NICE HEALTHY LIFE
GET TO THE OTHER END
THEN OUR NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO SLICE THE STOCKS AND THERE SUPPOSE TO BE SLICED 1/8 THICK AND HERE'S A LITTLE WHEN YOU BUY ASPARAGUS SOMETIMES SOME OF IT IS A LITTLE WRINKLED YOU WANT IT PERFECT YOU WANT TO TAKE OFF THE HARD END AND THROW THAT AWAY AND SAVE THE STOCK AND THEN I JUST LINE THEM UP LIKE THIS TO MAKE QUICK WORK
WHEN YOU GET TO THE END FINGERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ASPARAGUS SO IF YOU CAN'T GET TO THE LAST LITTLE ENDS WITHOUT CUTTING YOURSELF PLEASE DON'T
OKAY THE LEMON IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO USE AT THE END WHEN WE SERVE THE SCHNITZEL
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP THAT SHIELD UP AS YOU'RE PULLING THE BALL BACK BECAUSE IF NOT YOU PULL THE BALL BACK AND YOU LEAVE YOURSELF OPEN AND EXPOSED THE DEFENDER ALL HE HAS TO DO IS STEP THROUGH TAKE THAT BALL AND HE'S GOING TO GO DOWN ON THE OTHER END AND SCORE IT
AND IT LOOKS BETTER AT THE END WHEN YOU SEE THE FINISHED RESULT BECAUSE THIS IS NOT GOING TO LOOK LIKE CANDY CORN WHEN WE'RE DONE
AND THEN I LIKE TO END WITH A NICE WOO
YOU JUST OPEN IT ON THE ENDS AND YOU LIGHT EITHER END RIGHT THERE IN THE FIREPLACE
YOU REALLY WANT TO GO AS FAST AS YOU CAN INTO THAT TUMBLE GET A LOT OF POWER GOING AND REALLY SNAP OUT OF IT AND FROM HERE AT THE END OF OUR ROUND OFF IS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO DO ALL OF OUR BACK FLIPS BACK HANDSPRINGS AND FULLS
THIS IS A BIG BEGINNING STEP FOR THE END
THEN GRAB AT THE VERY END WITH THE SMALL PART OF YOUR NEEDLE NOSE PLIERS AND TWIST THE OPPOSITE WAY
I'M GOING TO END THIS SESSION BY COVERING UP THE BODY
AND SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT WANT TO JUST TAKE YOUR FINGER AND JUST PULL THE PAINT BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT WILL DRY AROUND THE END OF THE NEEDLE
WE CUT OF THE END HERE AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TO MAKE THESE A LITTLE LESS DANGEROUS TO CUT WE DON'T WANT TO CUT ALONG ACROSS HERE
IT'S AS IF YOU'RE SETTING A STRING OF PEARLS ON THE TABLE ONE PEARL AT A TIME AND AT THE VERY END RELEASING THE PELVIS
YOU NOTICE THE YO-YO IS JUST SPINNING RIGHT AT THE END OF THE STRING
I AM HITTING WITH THE HEEL MOST BEGINNERS RATHER THAN BRINGING IT ACROSS AND KICKING STRAIGHT OUT THEY WILL NOT GET IT ACROSS AIM THE SHIN AND END UP DOING A SLOPPY ROUNDHOUSE KICK
APPLY YOUR MASCARA AND DO SEVERAL COATS SO GET ONE GOOD COAT ON EACH SET OF EYELASHES AND THEN IF YOU'RE SATISFIED WITH WHAT YOU THINK A SECOND COAT IS GOING TO LOOK PUT THAT SECOND COAT ON WHILE IT'S STILL WET TAKE YOUR SPARKLES PUT IT ON THE END OF THE SPONGE LIKE THAT AND JUST LIGHTLY WITH THE EYE SHUT BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO GET THEM INTO THE EYE TOUCH IT UP AND THERE YOU GO SPARKLES ON YOUR EYELASHES
YOU'RE GOING TO GRAB YOUR WIRE AT THE END AND START MAKING THAT SAME CURVING MOTION THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING
NOW THIS IS A PROBLEM MOST OF MY CLIENTS HAVE THEY'RE TOO NICE THE GIRLS IS ALWAYS ASKING THEM TO DO THINGS FOR THEM THEY END UP BECOMING THE BEST FRIEND SHE CRIES ON THEIR SHOULDER AND THEN SOMEHOW IN THE END THEY DON'T WIN HER HEART AS A RESULT
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS JUST HOLD THAT OVER THE CAMERA WHEN YOU'RE SHOOTING AND YOU'RE BEHIND THAT AND IT'S REALLY ONLY GOING TO SHOW THE THE FRONT END OF THE LENS AND MINIMIZE ANY BLACK SPOTS ON THE REFLECTION
THANKFULLY WE'RE DONE WITH THAT VERY DISORIENTING PUZZLE AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF THIS TEST CHAMBER
SO GO AHEAD AND TAKE THE END OF YOUR NEEDLE TOOL
YOU'LL PLACE THE BLOCK ON ITS TALL END IN THE ABDOMEN EITHER JUST ABOVE THE PUBIC BONE OR JUST BELOW THE RIBS AND YOU CAN DO IT IN BOTH PLACES
AT THE END OF YOUR TURN YOU MUST DISCARD ONE CARD IN YOUR HAND
THE MOST OF THE POWER IS IN THE END OF THE BAT
A BOTTLE BAT IT HAS A LARGER SWEET SPOT BUT IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T PRODUCE AS MUCH POWER AS AN END LOADED BAT
THESE SHELFS ARE 25 1/2 INCHES WIDE BECAUSE 3/4'S OF AN INCH THE THICKNESS PLUS 25 1/2 INCHES PLUS ANOTHER 3/4'S ON THIS END ADDS UP TO 27 INCHES
YOU DON'T WANT TO END UP WITH AN OUTLINE OF YOUR GRID LIKE THIS SO YOU USE A LIGHT PENCIL TO MAKE THE GRID SO THAT YOU CAN ERASE IT LATER AND YOU DON'T HAVE THIS BIG GRID SITTING THERE IN THE MIDDLE
TO CUT OUT THE END PIECES WE USE A RADIAL ARM SAW TO SIZE UP THE LENGTH A TABLE SAW TO CUT THE WIDTH AND A BAND SAW TO CUT OUR ANGLES
THIS IS TOTALLY OPTIONAL FOR YOU BUT I REALLY LIKE TO DO SOME FRIED TORTILLAS STRIPS IN THE SOUP AT THE END BECAUSE IT MAKES IT REALLY CRUNCHY
YOU NEVER WANNA RUB A CONCEALER CAUSE YOU GONNA END UP RUBBING IT RIGHT OFF
FOR INSTANCE IN A BLUFF YOU COULD END UP COMMITTING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF YOUR CHIPS
THE PERSON AGAINST WHOM YOU ARE PLAYING MAY HAVE A LEGITIMATE HAND AND YOU COULD END UP LOSING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF YOUR CHIPS
THIS WILL HELP YOU SO THAT WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF YOUR GRIND YOU'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO
NOW THIS CABLE DIFFERS FROM AN INSTRUMENT CABLE IN THAT IT DOES MATTER WHICH END YOU USE
THE THING YOU'LL SEE HERE THERE'S THREE PRONGS ON ONE END
THIS WOULD BE THE MALE END
AND THE FEMALE END YOU'LL SEE THAT'S WHERE THERE'S HOLES INSTEAD OF PLUGS
MARSH FLITTER BECOMES A 3/3 UNTIL END OF TURN
YOU OLLIE ONTO THE TOP HOLD THE MANUAL POSITION AND THEN JUST BEFORE YOU GET TO THE END INSTEAD OF ROLLING STRAIGHT OFF YOU'LL GOT FRONT SIDE 180 TO FAKIE
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU PULL THE GUARD YOU HAVE A RUNNING BACK COMING THROUGH OR THAT THE TACKLE KNOWS THAT HE HAS TO COVER OR WE HAVE A TIGHT END CRACKING DOWN ETC
ADD THAT CHEST POP AT THE END
AND EITHER AT THE VERY END OR AFTER EACH COIL THAT YOU LAY IN YOU CAN TAKE YOUR SPONGE AND JUST SMOOTH THAT OUT
PUTTING YOUR WALL TOGETHER CONSIST OF PUTTING PIECES TOGETHER AND AS WE SEE HERE WE HAVE TWO STRAIGHT END PIECES THAT HAVE GROOVES ON EQUAL AND OPPOSITE SIDES AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO MATCH THE GROOVES ON THE SIDES UP AND SLIDE THEM TOGETHER
YOU WANT TO START BASICALLY AT THE END OF THE EYE AND YOU WANT TO MAKE KIND OF A CAT'S EYE
AT THE EAVE CUT THE END AND FOLD CLOSED
WE NORMALLY BEGIN WITH STRETCHING MOVE ON TO SOME MORE ENERGETIC STANDING POSES AND THEN END WITH STRETCHING AND MEDITATION
YOU WILL NOTICE I STILL USE THE E BRIGG TO KIND OF KICK THE BACK END OUT IF I FIND MYSELF UNDER STEERING A LITTLE BIT THROUGH THE CORNER AND THAT JUST HELPS PROLONG THE DRIFT IN THESE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE CARS AND IT IS PRETTY MUCH A TECHNIQUE I USE IN MOST ALL FOUR WHEEL DRIVE CARS THAT I DRIFT JUST AS A LITTLE SAFETY DEVICE
IT'S ALSO NICE TO USE THE MATCHSTICKS BECAUSE IN THE END WHEN THEY'RE ALL SITTING ON TOP OF THE CORRUGATED STRIPS WE CAN PUT THEM NICE AND STRAIGHT AND EVEN ON THE EDGES
ALRIGHT IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MAKING OUR END STOP FOR OUR TABLE SAW TAPER CUT JIG
CUT IT REALLY FINE YOUR GOING TO CUT OFF THE END OF IT YOUR GOING TO CUT OFF THAT END SLICE OFF THE SKIN AND BRUSCHETTA IS REALLY COOL
AND THE SAME GOES FOR THE INSIDE LOOP OF THE CAR END OF THE TERMINAL THE FEMALE SIDE
PROBABLY YOU END UP PAYING LIKE THIRTY CENTS OF A DOLLAR AND MOST OF THE RESTAURANTS OR HOTELS THEY WON'T LET YOU USE THE TOILET UNLESS YOU ARE STAYING AT THAT PLACE OR YOU ARE EATING
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE FULL SPIN WITH OUR RIGHT STICK LIKE THIS BUT AT THE END OF IT WE'RE GOING TO KICK OUR LEG OVER THE TOP AND THROW UP IN THE MIDDLE
ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM IS A TINY LITTLE REEL WHICH ISN'T MARKED BUT THIS IS AN OLD ORVIS CFO REEL AND THIS HAS GOT A ONE WEIGHT LINE ON IT AND ABOUT THIRTY YARDS OF BACKING
AND IF IT'S TOO WIDE YOUR THERAPIST IS GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME WORKING AROUND IT AND END UP PROBABLY INJURING HER BACK SO TWENTY EIGHT TO THIRTY TWO INCHES IS USUALLY THE RECOMMENDED WIDTH FOR A MASSAGE TABLE
IT'S GOT A LITTLE ROUND THING ON THE END OF IT
A FOOT ENTRAPMENT CAN END YOUR DAY PRETTY QUICKLY
NEXT LET'S ADD SOME HORSE LEGS TO OUR COMBINATION JUST AT THE VERY END
THE TRUTH BE TOLD BE TOLD THE ONLY WAY REALLY TO END A RELATIONSHIP WITH A SCORPIO IS TO DIE BECAUSE SCORPIO TRULY FEELS THE PHRASE THAT IF YOU LOVE SOMETHING SET IT FREE
SO THE CENTERING PART IS THE FIRST BOOKEND AND THE RELAXATION AT THE END IS THE SECOND BOOKEND AND YOU HAVE THE ENTIRE PRACTICE IN THE CENTER
ONCE AGAIN YOU'RE JUST GOING TO WANT TO TAKE THE SAFETY PIN BEND IT BACKWARDS CUT AS CLOSE TO THE CIRCLE AT THE END AS YOU CAN PUT THE CENTER THROUGH YOUR NEEDLE-NOSE PLIERS AND BEND
SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS JUST SET UP ON WHATEVER LEDGE YOU WANT TO END UP POPPING OUT ON BY PUTTING YOUR FOOT ON THE TIP OF THE NOSE AND YOUR BACK FOOT SOMEWHERE BEHIND THE TRUCKS
NOW IMAGINE THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABOUT WHEN YOUR SPEED RUNS OUT AND YOU'VE REACHED THE END OF YOUR NOSEBLUNT SLIDE
YOU CAN SEE HOW THE BOAT ACCELERATES RIGHT AT THE VERY END
YOU REALLY NOTICE THAT ENERGY BUILDING UP AT THE END OF YOUR SWEEP STROKE
SO YOU HAVE SIX STRINGS ON YOUR GUITAR AND I LIKE TO USE THIS LITTLE GUIDE AT THE END OF MY GUITAR IT IS CALLED A ELECTRONIC TUNER
AND THEN THE LAST THING WE HAVE THAT'S KIND OF IN THE PARENTHESIS AND THE BRACKETS OF BEAT TWO WE HAVE A SIXTEENTH NOTE AT THE VERY END OF BEAT TWO THE LAST SIXTEENTH NOTE
SO LET ME SHOW YOU ON THE SIDE LIKE THIS AND THEN WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO END UP DOING IS POINTING IT OUT FORTY-FIVE DEGREES AND THEN CLOSING IN ON A FULL CIRCLE BUT THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO ON THE FROG KICK IS JUST BRING YOUR HEEL STRAIGHT UP TO YOUR BUTT LIKE THAT
YOU'LL BRING YOUR HAND LEGS UP TO YOUR BUTTOCKS LIKE THIS AND THEN YOU'LL END UP DOING A COMPLETE FULL-CIRCLE CLOSE WITH THE BREAST STROKE
AT THE END IN ORDER TO REALLY CREATE THAT BIT OF THAT DISCONNECT AND A BIT OF THE VERY TEXTURED STYLE YOU'RE GOING TO USE MORE OF A TEXTURY CREAM CONSISTENCY
THE CLASSES WERE FOR ONLY ABOUT TWO TO THREE MONTHS SO IT REALLY WASN'T A LOT OF CLASSES IN THE END
SO INTO THE OVEN NOW FOR ABOUT SO INTO THE OVEN NOW FOR ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES AT 350 DEGREES AND WE WILL COME BACK WHEN IT'S ALL READY AND SHOW YOU WHAT THE END RESULT LOOKS LIKE
YOU END UP WITH THIS GREAT KIND OF ONE-SIDE STACK COMING DOWN WHICH STILL MAINTAINS WITHIN THE SHOWER PATTERN BECAUSE YOU'RE VAMPING AND THROWING FROM ONE HAND
HIGH END PROFESSIONAL SEXY POKER DEALERS
THE ONLY PART THAT IS DIFFERENT IS THE END SO CONTINUE AND WE WILL MEET YOU THERE TO SHOW YOU HOW TO END THE SECOND LEVEL
YOU'LL PROBABLY BE SURPRISED THE CREATIVITY YOU'LL COME UP WITH IN THE END
BEFORE THE PARTY ENDS YOU WANT TO END IN STYLE WITH A BIG BANG SO PLAY A GROUP THING SO EVERYONE IS INCORPORATED
WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MEASURING BECAUSE WE ALREADY DID THAT AND IT'S GOING TO END UP NICE AND EVEN
WE'RE GOING TO END UP WITH FOUR INCH FINISHED TABS AND SINCE THEY FOLD OVER WE'RE GOING TO NEED IT TO BE EIGHT INCHES AND WE'RE GOING TO FOLD AND INCH UP IN TO THE INSIDE SO THAT IT'S NICE AND STURDY
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME CHILDREN THAT DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE AND THEN WHEN YOU FORCE THEM THEN IT MAY END UP BEING A PROBLEM
WHEN YOU GET TO THE END YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GO AHEAD AND DO A BACK STITCH TO CREATE YOUR KNOT AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO CUT IT
LIKE A BROOM HEAD ON THE FAR END IT'S TALL IT'S HEAVY ON THE FAR END
ANOTHER HELPFUL THING IS IF THERE'S MORE WEIGHT CONCENTRATED ON THE FAR END
AT THE END OF THIS BETTING ROUND THE PLAYER WILL DEAL THE LAST CARD TO EACH PLAYER THIS CARD BEING DEALT FACE DOWN OFTEN REFERRED TO AS DOWN AND DIRTY
ONE HERE WE GO AND THE RIM CLICK ON TWO END OF THREE ONE INTO TWO AND FOUR
SO IF I MOVE THE FULCRUM ALL THE WAY UP WHAT I'M DOING IS ACTUALLY SHORTENING THE DISTANCE TO THE END OF THE BOARD
WE ARE KEEPING THE LOOPS IN FORMATION BY PINCHING MY OTHER HAND NOW AND I AM GOING TO TAKE THIS TAB END OR THE SHORT END AND WE WILL GO FROM THE OUTSIDE IN AND WE ARE GOING TO RUN THAT THING THROUGH THE LOOP AND KIND OF GET THAT LOOP THE SAME SIZE AS THE OTHER LOOPS AND JUST KIND OF PULL EVERYTHING RIGHT ON DOWN JUST LIKE THAT
TAKE THE LINE YOU PINCH IT AND YOU LEAVE A LITTLE BIT OF LOOP HERE AND IT MAKES A GOOD FISHING KNOT TOO AND WE ARE GOING TO PUT THE SHORT END ON THE TOP AND LEAVE A LITTLE BIT OFF FOR THE NAIL HERE AND I AM GOING TO WRAP IT AROUND THREE TIMES THAT'S THREE AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO PINCH
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO THE TINY LITTLE NERVE ENDINGS AND STIMULATE THE NEURAL IMPULSE TO THE OTHER END OF THE NERVE WHICH IS GOING TO BE ATTACHED TO WHATEVER ORGAN YOU'RE WORKING
WE'RE GOING TO TOUCH THE END OF THE STEP OR THE END OF THE CHAIR AND THEN SIT BACK UP SO IT'S JUST A QUICK TAP AND GO
TO END OFF THIS RIFF I'M GOING TO BRING MY INDEX FINGER DOWN AND PAD THE SECOND FRET OF THE D STRING HERE
SOME OF IT WILL DRIP OFF BUT IT'LL ELONGATE THOSE DRIPS AND MAKE THEM JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE DRAMATIC IN THE END
SO WHEN WE'RE DONE DOING THREE OF THOSE WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO ONE MORE SINGLE WHIP TO END THE MOVE
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T ACCOUNT FOR IT PROPERLY YOU COULD END UP IN THE ROUGH OR THE TREES OR WHO KNOWS WHERE
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO WATCH OUT BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL YOU WILL END UP WITH A BONE OR TWO IN HERE
NONE OF THE SHOULDER POINTS ARE PARTICULARLY EASY SO YOU MAY END UP JUST DOING MASSAGE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE
YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SECURE THE BEGINNING AND THE END WHERE YOU START AND FINISH TO SEW
YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH TWENTY GAZILLION PAPER TRACING PIECES IN ORDER TO GET ONE PERFECT DESIGN AND I'M JUST TRYING TO SHOW YOU IT IN ONE GO WHICH IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE
AT THE END OF IT THERE IS ROOTS SOMETIMES COMING OUT HERE AND THERE IS ROOTS BEHIND IT WHICH SHOWS PERSPECTIVE TOO BECAUSE IT GOES BEHIND IT AND THEN IT GOES IN FRONT OF IT
YOU CAN DO ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES BUT THEN AT THE END OF IT YOU GET JUST A FEW OF THE LEAVES COMING IN HERE
SO ONCE YOU DO THAT THEN WE MOVE UP TO THE OTHER END OF THE BASS
BECAUSE IF NOT YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH A TON OF WRAPPING
THERE'S ONE MORE WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR END YOU WANT ABOUT FIVE TO SEVEN INCHES HERE LEFT OVER
NOW YOUR GOING TO LIFT THAT UP SEE IT'S VERY SOFT AND WERE GOING TO TAKE OUR CENTER AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO WRAP THAT PEDAL AROUND THE CENTER AND REMOVE A BIT AT THE END AND WE'LL PUT THAT TO THE SIDE
THE BEST PLACE IS PROBABLY A MAGIC STORE BECAUSE THEY USUALLY CARRY TRICK DICE WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY ROLL THE DICE AND END UP ROLLING SEVENS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT
I JUST WANT IT TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE PIZZAZZ AT THE END OF MY SCENE HERE
OKAY WHAT I'M DOING IS I'M JUST DRY BRUSHING THIS RED ON HERE AND I JUST WANT TO ADD A LITTLE BIT JUST TO GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE DIMENSION BECAUSE THE END RESULT IS WHERE THIS IS GOING TO SHOW UP NOT SO MUCH RIGHT NOW
SO FOR EVERY THREE STROKES YOU'LL END UP TAKING A BREATH
SOMETIMES YOU GET ANGRY SOMETIMES MAYBE YOU DON'T TALK ANYMORE SOMETIMES YOU POUT SOMETIMES YOU'RE BITTER SOMETIMES YOU END UP BREAKING UP
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS WHEN THE INFORMATION WHEN WE CLICK ON THE END WHEN WE PUT THE INFORMATION INTO OUR LETTER THESE FIELDS ARE GOING TO BE BLANK BECAUSE THERE IS NO INFORMATION THERE AND SO ALL OF THESE FIELDS THAT WE SEE HERE ARE GOING TO CREATE BLANK PAGES FROM OUR DOCUMENT
IT'S A WAY TO GET END TO DOING TRICKS
WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE FIRST STRING ON WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE BALL END OF THE STRING WE'RE GOING TO PUT THAT RIGHT IN THIS SLOT ON THE TAIL PIECE
WE CAN USE SOMETHING THAT IS A LITTLE BIT LIGHTER WEIGHT CAUSE IT STILL WILL GET A NICE HOLD YET IT WOULD NOT WEIGHT HER HAIR DOWN WHICH IN THE END IT WILL MAKE HER HAIR FALL AS THE DAY GOES ON
TO IRON MULTIPLE PLEATS YOUR GOING TO FOLD YOUR PLEAT GET IT FLAT HOLD IT WITH YOUR HAND PUT YOUR IRON DOWN AND RUN ALONG YOUR PLEAT JUST RUN TO THE END
HOLD THEM BOTH TOGETHER ONCE AGAIN AND AS YOU IRON INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE EDGE MOVE YOUR IRON OVER AND GO TO YOUR PLEAT THAT YOU WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THIS LEAVES A SOFT ENDING TO YOUR PLEAT AS OPPOSE TO A HARD END WHERE IT LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE A DART
THE SIMPLEST WAY TO START A SIPHON IS TO FILL A RACKING CANE AND HOSE FILLED WITH WATER PINCH OFF THE END THEN DIP THE END OF THE RACKING CANE INTO YOUR BEER AND THEN OPEN UP THE OTHER END INTO THE VESSEL IN WHICH YOU WANT TO SIPHON YOUR BEER INTO
AS YOU ARE RACKING FROM THE TOP YOU WANT TO KEEP THE END OF THE RACKING CANE UNDERNEATH THE TOP LEVEL BUT NOT DOWN IN ANY MUCK THAT MAY BE FORMING AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR FERMENTER
HE ASKED THE LADY ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE IF SHE WANTED HER STUFF SHIPPED TO CRIB WELL THE LADY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT
AND THEN FOR THE SAUCE WE'RE GOING TO USE A LITTLE GARLIC POWDER SOME CHOPPED GARLIC A LITTLE BIT OF VINEAGAR SOME SOY SAUCE WATER SUGAR AND MIX THAT AROUND AND THEN AT THE END WE'LL SPRINKLE A FEW CHIVES ON TOP AND WE SHOULD BE READY TO GO
GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS WE WANT TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THIS END THE PART THAT'S GOING TO BE INSERTED
WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS BE CUTTING YOUR MATERIAL IN THE MIDDLE OF BOTH OF YOUR SAWHORSES BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET ALMOST THE WAY THROUGH THE END IS JUST GOING TO BREAK AND FALL IN THE CENTER AND YOU COULD POTENTIALLY GET INJURED
YOU WANT THE CUT END OF YOUR MATERIAL TO DROP OFF OF ONE SIDE SO THAT WHEN YOU RUN THE SAW DOWN HERE IT WILL FALL OFF THE SIDE ON TO THE GROUND
GO AHEAD AND PUT THAT GLASS END IN ON THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR DOOR
THERE ARE MANY WEBSITES THAT CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH ONLINE BABYSITTING TRAINING AND AT THE END OF THE TRAINING COMPLETION WILL ALLOW YOU TO PRINT OUT A CERTIFICATE
WE GOT THE END PIECE THAT WE ARE USING AS WELL AS THE DRUMMLETS AND IT LOOKS PRETTY SEASONED SO WE WOULD MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT STEP
SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD IN THE KICK ON THE END OF FOUR JUST FOR HA HA'S AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE IF IT DEVELOPS A GOOD FOUNDATION ON IT IT WILL FILL IN THE SOUND A LITTLE INSTEAD OF JUST A CRASH WHILE HANGING OUT WILL SEE ALRIGHT
SO SAME THING JUST ADD IN THE END OF FOUR ON THE KICK ALONG WITH THE CRASH SO
ALRIGHT SO EVERYTHING IS THE SAME EIGHTH NOTE HI-HAT ONE THREE ON KICK TWO AND FOUR ON SNARE AND THE END OF FOUR ON THE CRASH
AND THAT ALLOWS THE SEATBELT TO MOVE ON THE FEMALE END THE FEMALE LATCH SIDE
SO IN THIS CASE WHAT I'M AFTER IS A P THAT I WANT TO PUT RIGHT HERE SO THAT I END UP WITH PLACING AND SPACING
THIS TOOL HERE NEEDLE TOOL GEN TOOL BOOM BOOM BOOM PUT THE GEN PUT THE NEEDLE TOOL WHERE YOU CAN SEE IT SO IT DOESN'T END UP IN YOUR FINGER
SO IT KIND OF ADDS NOT JUST A NICE LITTLE KIND OF BLUESY TWANG TO IT BUT NOW YOU'RE ADDING NOTES KIND OF IN THE LOWER END WHICH KIND OF GIVES IT THIS WALKING BASS SOUND
THE BOLTS ARE THESE FOUR SCREWS ON EACH END THAT HOLD YOUR TRUCKS ONTO YOUR BOARD
ANOTHER USE IS A V-LOWER AND THIS IS A MORE CONTROLABLE WAY OF PUTTING YOURSELF ON THE END OF TWO LINES WHERE YOU'RE THEN AT THE POINT HERE AND YOU CAN BE MOVED BACK AND FORTH AND UP AND DOWN THE RIVER ON THE END OF THAT V ALL OF THESE WE WILL BE SHOWING YOU LATER
YOU'RE GOING TO STAND ON THE END OF THE BOARD WITH BACK TOWARDS THE WATER
SO ONCE YOU DO THAT THEN YOU'RE GOING TO PUT ONE YOU'RE GOING TO FEED ONE END INTO THE OTHER ONE
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER WE'VE GOT THE D A D AND THE F NATURAL THERE AT THE END
START FROM THE BEGINNING THE MIDDLE OR THE END AND WHENEVER YOU TOUCH AND MOVE THE FADER THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE WHATEVER AUTOMATION YOU'VE ALREADY HAD WRITTEN
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT NOW IS MOUNTING A SHOTGUN GETTING THE SHOTGUN IN THE POSITION WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE END OF THE GUN AND ALSO SEE THE TARGET
I'M JOE CUENCO WITH END RESOURCES- RELATIONSHIPS FOR LIFE
SEE NOT STANDING ON THE GAS WILL JUST KILL THE DRIFT AND YOU'LL JUST END UP WITH TOO MUCH DRIFT
ONE IS PUTTING A LITTLE PIECE OF RUBBER TUBING THIS IS BASICALLY LIKE SURGICAL TUBING ON THE END OF YOUR BLOWPIPE JUST MAKES IT A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE YOU DON'T WANT TO BITE ON THE THING BUT IT JUST MAKES IT A LITTLE EASIER IN YOUR MOUTH
ALWAYS HOLDING ON TO THE END OF THE BALLOON SO IT DOESN'T COME APART
SO JUST LIKE WE DID ON THE FLOOR I'M GOING TO START WITH THREE WHITE ONES IN ONE HAND AND TWO RED ONES IN THE OTHER BUT I'M GOING TO CATCH THEM ALL AND I'M GOING TO CATCH AND WHEN I END UP I WILL HAVE THE WHITE ONES IN THIS HAND AND THE RED ONES IN THE OTHER HAND
JUST GO AHEAD AND PUT THEM IN LIKE THAT YOU CAN PUT THE END AND THEN LIKE THIS TOO AND THEN YOU WANT TO SHAKE THEM OFF SO IT'S NOT TO MUCH FLOUR AND THEN YOU PUT THEM IN YOUR HOT PAN HEAR THAT SIZZLE IT'S WHAT YOU WANT YOU WANT TO SEAL IN THE JUICES ONE THESE PORK CHOPS CAUSE THEY WILL BE BAKED LATER
WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF THE SAMPLE STOP IT WITH YOUR HAND CLOSE THE FADER AND MOVE BACK TO THE BEGINNING
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TAKE YOUR ROUND NOSE PLIERS AND JUST GRAB IT RIGHT AT THE VERY END THE LARGER END OF YOUR PLIERS
ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR HOOK YOU'RE GOING TO GO DOWN TOWARDS THE END OF THE WIRE
BY THE END OF ANY GIVEN PROJECT YOU MIGHT HAVE TEN TO TWENTY TO THIRTY FOLDERS WITH DIFFERENT NAMES
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REAR END OF THE CAR IS WHERE YOU WANT IT AND NOT BE SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE FRONT END
YOU CAN CORRECT REALLY QUICKLY THE FRONT END OF THE CAR BUT IT TAKES TEN FEET PULLING FORWARD TO CORRECT MORE THAN FOUR INCHES WITH YOUR BACK TIRES
YOU CAN EASILY REPAIR YOUR STAKES BY DUCT TAPING THEM OR YOU CAN GO IN AND JUST FIND A HARD WOOD SHARPEN ONE END OF IT AND USE THAT AS A STAKE THAT'S AN EASIER REPLACEMENT
WHAT I'LL ALSO DO AT THIS POINT BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT SAW MARKS AND OTHER MARKS FROM THE PARTING TOOL I'LL SQUARE UP THE TOP END OF THE BODY
I AM GOING TO USE MY BIG HEAVY SCRAPER AND CUT FROM HERE ABOUT UP TO HERE AND THE SCRAPER DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB ON FLAT GRAIN BUT WHEN IT COMES OVER TO HERE WHERE YOU HAVE GOT END GRAIN AND SIDE GRAIN IT HAS A TENDENCY TO TEAR
DON'T PUT IT EXACTLY ON THE END BUT WE NEED TO LEAVE IT OVER A LITTLE BIT PROBABLY ABOUT HALF THE WIDTH OF THE TAPE AND THAT IS GOING TO BE TUCKED IN INTO THE BOTTOM AND GIVE IT MORE WHERE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT
IT'S NOT REALLY USED AS A TIME KEEPER IT'S USED MOSTLY FOR ACCENTS AND YOU KNOW AT THE END OF BIG FILLS OR THE START OF A SONG OR YOU'LL HEAR AS YOU LISTEN TO MORE AND MORE MUSIC
ONCE THAT GLIDE IS STARTING TO SLOW DOWN WHEN YOU'RE DOING BREAST STROKE THEN WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO END UP DOING IS JUST FACING YOUR HANDS YOU KNOW TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND THEN DOING A PULL
AND WHEN YOU DO END UP PULLING YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP FOR AIR AND THAT'S WHEN YOU'LL TAKE YOUR BREATH IF YOU NEED IT IT'S UP TO YOU BUT YOU'LL TAKE YOUR BREATH FOR AIR AND THEN YOU'LL PUT YOUR HEAD BACK IN THE WATER AND GO AGAIN
THEY DON'T GET TO DRAW THE PICTURE UNTIL THEY FINISH WRITING THAT'S KIND OF THE RULE IT'S LIKE OF A REWARD AT THE END
NOW TO DO THE OTHER END YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT THE GUITAR UPRIGHT
YOU WOULD NEED TO USE THE FEMALE END TO PLUG INTO THE MIC AND THEN THE MALE END WOULD GO INTO THE AMPLIFIER
FOR THIS SHIRT THOUGH WHAT I WANT TO DO IS IN THE END I'M GOING TO TAKE IT OFF HANG THAT BACK UP AND I'M STILL GOING TO GET THE PUCKERING OUT BY IRONING THE CUFFS AND COLLARS
IN USING TAPE AND A COMPUTER TOGETHER BECAUSE I THINK YOU GET THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS THIS WAY TIME CODE WILL SYNC UP YOUR TAPE WITH YOUR PRO TOOLS AND THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPERT AND YOU MIGHT HAVE TO BOOK A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR AN HOUR ROOM TO DO IT BUT IF YOU RECORD YOUR DRUMS AND BASS TO TAPE SYNC THAT UP AND THEN PLAY YOUR GUITARS DO YOUR VOCALS DIGITALLY YOU REALLY DO HAVE THE MARRIAGE OF GETTING THE THE CERTAIN LOW END REPRESENTATION THAT TAPE GIVES AND THE WARMTH AND THE DEPTH THAT IT GIVES TO THAT RANGE AND STILL HAVING THE EASE OF EDITING AND AND TUNING AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS EASE OF OPERATION AND THE QUICKNESS THAT RECORDING IN THE DIGITAL REALM GIVES YOU
AND NEXT I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO CUT AND TIE THE FRINGE ON THE END
AND JUST CONTINUE THIS ALL THE WAY DOWN THE END OF THE SCARF
THIS IS AMPLE SPACE FOR YOU TO DO AT A STOP SIGN OR YOUR RED LIGHT AND IN THE EVENT THAT HE DOES STOP IT GIVES YOU PLENTY OF TIME TO STOP AND KEEPS YOU A SAFE DISTANCE IN THE EVENT OF A BACK END COLLISION
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BOX IS SECURE SO THE CAT IS NOT GOING TO END UP TIPPING IT OVER OR ANYTHING
BUT WHAT IT INVOLVES WHAT IT BASICALLY MEANS IS YOU TAKE A PIECE OF CANVAS LIKE THIS AND THROUGH A PROCESS THAT REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT OF WORK YOU END UP WITH A PRODUCT LIKE THIS WHERE IT'S BASICALLY WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENED IS THE CANVAS IS WRAPPED AROUND SOME PIECES OF WOOD STRETCHER BARS AND SECURED IN THE BACK
AS I'M OVERLAPPING MY FEET USING THE CATWALK I'M GOING TO CROSS TURN OUT AND STEP INTO MY HALF TURN TURNING OUT SO THAT WHEN I GET TO THE END OF THE RAMP ONCE AGAIN I CLOSE IT WITH THE BASIC A VERY PROFESSIONAL WAY OF STANDING AFTER YOU HAVE DONE THE TURNS
YOU WANT TO PICK UP A LITTLE BIT OF SPEED PULL UP THE FRONT END COUNTER BALANCE JUST LET IT GO
I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PLUG THE END OF THAT TUBING WITH MY THUMB AND REMOVE THIS WHOLE THING PLACE OUR RACKING CANE DOWN INTO OUR BEER TAKE YOUR GLASS AND GO AHEAD AND LOWER IT TOWARDS THE FLOOR AND NOTICE THAT I STILL HAVE MY RACKING CANE FULL OF SANITIZER HERE AND MY THUMB IS THE ONLY THING HOLDING THIS SANITIZER INSIDE THE RACKING CANE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT
WHAT I'M DOING HERE IS COILING THE END OF THIS SIPHIN CANE DOWN INTO OUR BUCKET HERE ALLOWING THE SOFT TUBING TO FILL WITH SANITIZER
WHAT I GENERALLY DO IS AGAIN FROM THERE JUST HIT PLAY FROM WHEREVER YOU CUT IT OFF AT THE END OF THE LAST TRACK GIVE IT A GOOD FIVE TO TEN SECONDS HIT STOP THEN WE CAN ZERO IT OUT AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE YOU'RE IN A DIFFERENT POINT IN THE TAPE BUT YOU CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND START RECORDING ANOTHER SONG
IF YOU ONLY HAVE A CHANCE TO STRETCH ONCE I WOULD RECOMMEND STRETCHING AT THE END OF THE WORKOUT BUT IF YOU HAVE THE TIME AFTER YOUR WARM-UP AND YOUR MUSCLES ARE LOOSE STRETCH BEFORE YOUR WORKOUT AS WELL
STR SPL SKL SPR AND HAVE THEM JUST SAY THOSE AND TRY NOT TO PUT THE VOWEL ON THE END LIKE I DID
NOW LOOK AT THIS I HAVE THREE IN THE BEGINNING TWO ON THE END
AT THE END OF THAT TWO MINUTES I'M GOING TO STOP AND I'M GOING TO DO SOME BASIC LUNGES
AT THE END OF THAT FIVE MINUTES I'M GOING TO KICK INTO MY FIRST CARDIO BURST
AND SO YOU TAKE THE LOOSE END AND YOU GO OVER THAT YOU GO OVER THIS OTHER END
AS AN ALTERNATIVE YOU CAN SIMPLY PUT THE HOOK INTO THE WOODEN END OF THE TIP-UP
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PROBLEMS THAT YOU MAY END UP WITH IN THE FUTURE AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST THAT YOU RUN AWAY FROM
YOU CAN GO ON THE HIGHER END FOR SOME OF THE HIGHER STRENGTH BEERS LIKE THE IPAS AND ALSO FOR THE WHEAT S WHICH WILL PULL OUT A LITTLE MORE OF THE INTERESTING PHENOLICS
BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TAKE OFF THE ROOT END HERE
NOW WORKING WITH A GLUE STICK CAN SOMETIMES BE A LITTLE BIT TRICKY BECAUSE SOMETIMES GLUE STICKS CLUMP AND SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE USING IT A CERTAIN DIRECTION THE RIBBON STICKS TOGETHER SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS PLACE YOUR FINGER ON ONE END AND PUSH AWAY FROM YOURSELF WITH THE GLUE STICK
AND YOU START FROM ONE END AND JUST PRESS LIGHTLY TO MAKE IT STICK TO THE FRAME
NOW THERE IS THIS END HERE AND THIS END
SO NOW IT'S THE THREE GUYS FROM THE OTHER END AGAINST THESE TWO GUYS
SO IF I WERE TO SAY WITH NEW COMPUTERS STARTING IN THE $500 RANGE UNLESS IT'S A REAL HIGH END MACHINE YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN THAT
ONE END OF THE PLUG GOES INTO THE COMPUTER AND THE OTHER ONE OBVIOUSLY GOES INTO THE VCR
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS ONE MY OTHER WORKING END AND IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN LIKE SO
SO WE PUT THE MATCH STICKS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE END
AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO TAKE IT AND I'M GOING TO PULL A BITE UNDERNEATH THE REST OF MY WORKING END
ALRIGHT THERE IS WHERE I THINK I WANT MY TO FINISH AND NORMALLY WHAT I WOULD DO IS TIE THESE OFF AT THE END HERE AND THAT WOULD BE FINISH
HE SAID I NEED TO KNOW FOR SURE IS IT GOING TO BE OPENING BY THE END OF THIS YEAR OR NOT
HE SAID ARE YOU SURE THAT YOUR OFFICE IN ROME WILL OPEN BY THE END OF DECEMBER
A GOOD HIGH END CHESS SET WILL BE HEAVY THESE ARE QUITE HEAVY
ONCE YOU GET THAT DOWN THE MANUALING PART YOU COULD MAYBE EVEN LEARN HOW TO PERFECT A SMALL OLLIE OUT OF THE MANUAL AT THE END OR YOU COULD JUST COAST OFF AND RIDE AWAY FROM THE MANUAL
WHICH I STICK INTO THE END OF THE TUBE
IF WE COME OFF SPENDING WHICH I HOPE WE END UP SPENDING NO MORE THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ON THIS WE'LL SEE WHAT THE MARKET VALUE OF THIS IS IT'LL BE AN INTERESTING THING FOR US TO KNOW IN OUR BEAUTIFUL NASHVILLE AREA HERE
GOOD MOVEMENT FROM CENTER CASTING THE TIP AS IF THERE WERE AN APPLE OR SOME PIECE OF FRUIT ON THE END OF YOUR SWORD AND YOU'RE FLICKING IT OFF
TO START YOU TAKE THE LARGER LINE AND CREATE A LOOP AND THEN YOU TAKE THE SMALLER LINE AND RUN IT THROUGH THIS WAY AWAY FROM THIS END OF THE LOOP
AND THEN WHERE I END WITH IT IS I END RIGHT WHERE THAT LAST EYELASH ENDS AT THE END OF MY EYE
I'M GETTING IT REALLY GOOD AT THE END AND WORKING IN A WAY I'M GETTING IT NEAR THAT EYELASH LINE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE AS THIN AS POSSIBLE
AND YOU CAN SEE LOOKING AT THIS INSTRUMENT FROM THE END THAT THERE IS A PRETTY NASTY TWIST IN THIS NECK
IF YOU SQUEEZE THE AIR ALL THE WAY TO THE END THEN YOU CAN MAKE A FOLD IN THE BALLOON LIKE THIS…I'M GOING TO MAKE AN S SHAPE OUT OF IT AND THEN YOU SQUEEZE RIGHT ACROSS AND JUST MAKE YOUR BOTH LOOP TWISTS AT ONCE AND THAT MAKES A LITTLE FLOWER JUST LIKE THAT THAT'S THE ONE BALLOON FLOWER
BY THE END OF SIXTY DAYS WE'VE LOST AN ADDITIONAL TEN TO TWELVE BY NINETY DAYS WE'VE LOST AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT TO TEN AND THEN BY THE TIME YOU'VE HIT THAT GOAL IN FOUR MONTHS YOU'LL BE UP TO YOUR GOAL WEIGHT AND YOU'LL HAVE LOST THE BALANCE OF POUNDS THAT YOU NEED TO LOSE
BUT REALLY IN TERMS OF HAVING A STABLE JOB WHERE YOU HAVE A TITLE THAT DOESN'T END AFTER ONE TO TWO YEARS IT'S ABOUT TWENTY YEARS TO GET THERE
AND THEY GET LOADED ON A CARGO SHIP AND THIS SHIP GOES FOR THIRTY DAYS ACROSS THE OCEAN AND ENDS UP IN EITHER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR OAKLAND CALIFORNIA OR AND I WOULD SAY THAT WAS ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF ALL SAKES IMPORTED IN TO THE UNITED STATES END UP THERE OR THEY TAKE THE LONG BOAT TO CHINA AND THEY GO DOWN TO THE PANAMA CANAL UP TO THE EAST COAST TO NEW JERSEY
THE REASON FOR THIS IS IF YOU START OUT WITH YOUR FIRST PULL GOING OUT YOU'RE GOING END UP WITH THIS PROBABLY FALLING OVER
JUST BEFORE YOU GET TO THE END I'D SUGGEST ABOUT SIX INCHES TO A FOOT BEFORE THE END YOU GET YOUR SHOULDERS ADJUSTED AND THEN FRONT SIDE 180 OUT AND LAND FAKIE AND ROLL AWAY
SO YOU OLLIE UP YOU MANUAL AND JUST ABOUT SIX INCHES BEFORE THE END YOU ADJUST YOUR WEIGHT
WHEN YOU'RE ON THE INTERNET YOU CAN FIND TONS OF DIFFERENT THINGS THROUGH ALL SORTS OF VARIETIES OF WEBSITES THAT WILL DIRECT YOU TO FESTIVALS THAT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR THAT YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR AND REGISTER FOR A BOOTH AND A LOT OF THE TIME A BOOTH WILL BE LIKE $200 BUT THEN THE MONEY THAT YOU CAN MAKE IN THE WEEKEND THAT THE FESTIVAL COMES IS IN THE THOUSANDS SO IT REALLY ENDS UP BEING QUITE FRUITFUL AND YOU CAN END UP GETTING A LOT OF GIGS FROM JUST PUTTING YOURSELF OUT THERE
NOW THERE'S THE STEERING END UP A LITTLE BIT AND THAT'S WHERE I GET THE CONTROL
THAT'S WHEN I'M GOING TO END UP PULLING MYSELF UP FOR A BREATH
END WITH TONER AND YOUR FAVORITE MOISTURIZER
THEY CLIMB UP ONTO THE WEEDS AND GRASS AND THEN THE GOATS RE-INGEST THEM AND END UP GETTING INFECTED
IT'S A VERY VERY SMALL END VERY TIGHT AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE CONCEALER/FOUNDATION BRUSH BUT IN A MUCH SMALLER FORM THE WAY THE BRISTLES ARE MADE
KEEP YOUR EYES AT THE END OF THE RAIL AND PRESS THAT OUT
I'LL WORK ALL THESE ATTACHMENTS AT THE END OF THIS ENTIRE QUADRICEPS GROUP RIGHT AROUND THE KNEE JOINT JUST GENTLY SOME GENTLE KNEADING THERE
WE HAVE A STERILE PROBE ON THE END OF THIS NEEDLE HOLDER AND THEN I KNOW WHERE THE PROBLEM IS AND I'VE GOT TO TILT HIS EAR THE WAY I HAVE TO GO
AT THE END OF THAT EIGHTEEN MONTHS INCLUDING A YEAR OF WORKING IN THE CLASSROOM YOU WERE GIVEN A FULL TEACHER CERTIFICATION
YOU'RE GOING TO USE THAT NICE LIQUID EYELINER TO DRAW A STRAIGHT LINE ALL THE WAY TO THE END
THE MORE DELICATE THE WIRE THE LESS HARD YOU WANT TO PUSH BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH MARKS ON YOUR SWIRL
SO WHAT YOU CAN USE YOU CAN USE THE CORNER OF THE WHEEL AND USE IT TO GRIND OUT THAT SECTION AND THEN IT WILL END UP LOOKING LIKE THIS
AND THAT'S OUR END STOP PIECE FOR OUR TABLE SAW TAPER CUT JIG
THIS ALSO PREPARES YOU ON MY END ON HOW TO HANDLE A LOT OF LOOSE BALLS
BUT IF YOU'RE DOING THIS RIGHT HERE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO END UP DOING IS YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WEAVING THIS INTO A LINE
THIS PIECE HAS A GLASS END AND THIS PIECE IS A HOLLOW TUBE
MAKE SURE TO START FROM THE END OF THE TABLE AND WORK YOUR WAY IN
IF AT THE END OF THOSE THREE ROUNDS SOMEONE HAS MORE POINTS THAN THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE IN THE GAME THAT PLAYER IS THE WINNER AND YOU GET ONE POINT FOR EACH STATE RANK THAT YOU HIT
IF AT THE END OF THOSE THREE ROUNDS THERE IS A TIE THEN YOU PLAY ON
I'M GOING TO PLANT THE BUSINESS END OF THE PADDLE IN THE WATER I'M GOING TO ROTATE BACKWARDS AND WATCH THAT PADDLE BLADE
SO ONE OF THE WAYS YOU CAN DO THAT IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE TRICKS THE END OF THE PADDLE THAT'S IN THE WATER IS CALLED THE BUSINESS END OF THE PADDLE
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO PLANT THAT END OF THE PADDLE IN THE WATER I'M GOING TO LOCK MY NECK AND MY HEAD ON MY SHOULDERS SO WHEN MY NECK MOVES TO WATCH THAT PADDLE BLADE MY WHOLE BODY'S GOING TO MOVE
ANOTHER OPTION IS TO DO THAT LARGE T AND A COUPLE HOP BACKS TO THE END
THAT'S OUR T STEP FROM THE END OF OUR BENCH
JUST LOOK FOR A LITTLE BIT OF THE END THAT STICKS OUT IT'S SORT OF THE CORE OF THE FEATHER BOA I PUT A LITTLE BIT OF GLUE ON THAT AND THEN SLIP THAT THROUGH THE LOOP
ANYTHING ABOVE TWENTY-FIVE IS CONSIDERED OVER WEIGHT ALSO GOING INTO THE LATTER END OF OBESITY
THAT'S HOW YOU END A RELATIONSHIP WITH A SCORPIO
SOME TRICKS DO INCLUDE CATCHING THE WRONG END BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO TOUCH ANY OF THOSE SO HERE WE GO HOW TO JUGGLE THREE CLUBS
AS FAR AS FLIGHT PATHS EVERYTHING IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO THREE BALL JUGGLING EXCEPT YOU HAVE THE ADDED COMPLEXITY OF THE CLUB SPINNING AND YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH THE RIGHT END
AND ALSO YOU WANT TO BE SURE THAT THIS ENDS UP IN A PLACE THAT MAKES SENSE THIS ONE BEING A SMALLER CIRCLE IF YOU IMAGINE DOT DOT DOT DOT DOT DOT AND IT ENDS UP HERE NOT WAY OUT HERE BUT THERE AND THIS ONE IS GOING TO END UP OUT A LITTLE FURTHER THAN THAT
I TEND TO FIND THAT THESE WORK JUST AS WELL BECAUSE WE END UP ACTUALLY TAPING AS YOU CAN SEE THE PIECE DOWN TO THE BOARD
IF YOU'RE LEFT HANDED YOU SIMPLY TAKE THE OTHER END OF THE LINE AND YOU'RE GOING TO GO WITH YOUR LEFT HAND
DID YOU KNOW THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN WOMAN WILL END UP SWALLOWING TEN POUNDS OF PETROLEUM BYPRODUCT FROM WEARING LIPSTICK ON A DAILY BASIS
SO WHAT I DO IS I'LL TAKE THEM AND CHOP OUT FROM ONE SECTION TO ANOTHER JOINT AND JUST REPLACE THAT WHERE THE JOINT OF THE BOARDS MEET AND IN THE END WHERE THEY GET SPONGY AND ROT OUT
NOW YOU WHEN YOU DO THIS YOU MIGHT WANT TO WELL YOU WILL WANT TO START OFF ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF GIRLS WHO YOU HAVE YOU END UP HAVING A LOT OF HAIR IN YOUR BATHTUB
NOW THE MORE YOU TRY THIS THE MORE BETTER PREPARED YOU'LL BE WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF YOUR NOSEBLUNT SLIDE
AND YOU WANT TO KEEP THE LITTLE BIT OF A FOLD THERE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT SPIN IN THE END
AND A LOT OF TIMES STRINGS END UP BREAKING RIGHT HERE AT THE NUT AS WELL AS AT THE TUNER AND DOWN AT THE BRIDGE
AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO BE USING TARRAGON TWICE HERE ONCE AT THE BEGINNING AND THEN ONCE AT THE VERY END
IT'S ARCHED AND ALREADY PRE-TIED WITH A LOOP ON THE END
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO START ON OUR HEELS TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE CHEAP MOTION BUT YOU'RE GOING TO END ON YOUR HEELS
AND THEN WHEN I END IT I DO THE SAME THREE LITTLE LOOPS
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY TAKE IT APART AND WIPE EVERYTHING DOWN BUT JUST GET THE CLOG OUT OF THE END OF THE TIP
OKAY THIS IS HOW YOU LAY IT ON THE TABLE THE TEMPLATE IS AT THE END OF THE TABLE SO WE CAN JUDGE HOW BIG WE NEED TO FOLD IT
SOMETIMES WE FORGET ABOUT IT AND WE DO OUR CARDIO EXERCISING AND OUR WEIGHT TRAINING AND WE JUST KIND OF DITCH THE STRETCHING AT THE END BUT FLEXIBILITY IS HUGELY IMPORTANT NUMBER ONE
AT THE END OF THE FIRST CHASSE IN THE CHASSE TO THE LEFT THE MAN TURNS THE LADY ONE CIRCLE AROUND
I'M ALWAYS RECRUITING AND I DON'T MEAN RECRUITING LIKE I'M HOPING SOMEBODY GETS IN A CAR WRECK AND BREAKS THEIR BACK AND THEY END UP IN A HOSPITAL
INHALE RELEASE AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND EXHALE AND CURL ALL THE WAY DOWN RELEASING THE PELVIS AT THE END
THE NICE THING ABOUT THESE CALIPERS IS THAT THIS WILL GO INTO SKINNY LONG VESSELS THIS END WILL AND THIS IS MADE FOR MORE OF OPEN BOWLS
THE REASON THAT YOU DO THAT IS SO THAT YOU GET A COFFEE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED IF YOU HAVE A COFFEE IN ONE AREA OF THE PUCK THAT IS LESS EVENLY DISTRIBUTED YOU HAVE LESS COFFEE THAN ANOTHER AREA IN THE PUCK AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE THAT THE WATER IS GOING TO TRAVEL THROUGH WHEN YOU'RE BREWING AN ESPRESSO WHICH IS AN EXTRACTION FLAW WHICH IS GOING TO END UP IN THE END PRODUCT OF THE CUP OF ESPRESSO
YOU WANT TO PAT VINYL AND NOT PULL ALONG TAPE BECAUSE THE VINYL WILL STRETCH AND THEN SHRINK AS IT HITS THE CLOTH AND YOU'LL END UP WITH A WRINKLY WINDOW
THIS IS A WIRE TOOL AND WE ARE GOING TO USE THAT TO DISCONNECT THE BOWL AT THE END OF THE PROJECT
AND I'M GOING TO FIND MY END
I'M SURE THE BIRTHDAY PARTY WILL END UP BEING FUN
IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO DOUBLE IT AND THEN JUST KNOT IT ON THE END BECAUSE IT JUST MAKES IT STRONGER
BUT WHAT I DO IS JUST GO AHEAD AND WORK YOUR WAY ACROSS AND I USUALLY GO AHEAD AND LEAVE THOSE GAPS IN BETWEEN BECAUSE THEN WHEN I GET TO THE END I TURN AROUND AND GO BACK OVER THE SPOTS THAT ARE LEFT OPEN AND SO IT MAKES FOR A CONSTANT LINE BUT THAT WAY YOU'RE NOT PULLING OUT YOUR OTHER STITCHES WHEREAS IF YOU TRIED TO DO IT THE OTHER WAY THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
GENERALLY THEY GO BEHIND THE SEAT YOU SLIDE THEM IN BEHIND THE BACK END AND THEN BLOW THEM UP THROUGH THE AIR TUBE RIGHT HERE AND THEN STUFF THE AIR TUBE RIGHT BACK END AND YOU HAVE NOTHING TO GRAB ONTO
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD END UP DOING ON THE SEVENTH STEP
ONCE YOUR GLIDE BEGINS TO SLOW DOWN ON THE SEVENTH STEP YOU'LL FACE YOUR HANDS TOWARDS YOUR THE TOP OF YOUR HANDS ARE GOING TO END UP FACING TOWARDS EACH OTHER THEN YOU'RE GOING TO END UP PULLING AND YOU'RE GOING TO PULL LIKE A HALF CIRCLE
NOW WHAT I'M GOING TO END UP SHOWING YOU IS YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS LIKE A PEDDLE
YOU'RE GOING TO END UP PULLING TOWARDS YOURSELF RIGHT PULLING THE WATER AND AS YOU PULL THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP FOR A BREATH
WHEN YOU REACH THE END OF YOUR GRIND AND YOU'VE LOST THE MAJORITY OF YOUR MOMENTUM YOU THEN WANT TO TURN THE NOSE OF THE BOARD BACK INTO THE RAMP ROLLING YOUR WHEELS OVER THE COPING ENSURING THAT YOU DO NOT HANG UP AND ROLL IN COMPLETING THE FIVE ZERO GRIND
BECAUSE THE END RESULT IS SUPERB IT MAKES A DIFFERENT STYLE DIFFERENT FLAVOR BREW ALTOGETHER
THE OTHER END OF THE WIRE IS GOING TO COME BACK INSIDE OF THE CRIMP BEAD
NOW WHAT MAKES IT SO DIFFICULT IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE TO ELEVATE THE END OF YOUR CUE STICK IF YOU DO NOT HIT DEAD CENTER ON THE BALL WHATEVER ENGLISHES THAT YOU WILL ACCIDENTALLY PUT ON THE CUE BALL WILL MAGNIFY BECAUSE IT'LL BE A SLIGHT MASSE SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HIT THE CENTER OF THE BALL OR IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON USING ENGLISH TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALLOW FOR IT
AND YOU WANT TO END UP OPPOSITE THAT VALVE STEM SO THAT YOU HAVE THE MOST SLACK IN THE TIRE TO ALLOW YOU TO POP THE LAST LITTLE BIT BACK ON
IT WILL MAKE IT WAY TOO STIFF WE STILL WANT TO WORK WITH THIS AND WORK WITH THE CURLS TOWARDS THE END WITH PLIABLE PASTE
THEY END UP TAKING OFF METAL AT A REALLY BLUNT ANGLE
IF NOT YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH ALL KINDS OF THINGS RUNNING TOGETHER
FOR THE LONG TAIL CAST ON TAKE YOUR YARN AND GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF LENGTH TO THE SHORT END PLACE THAT OVER YOUR THUMB AND THEN THE OTHER END ATTACH TO THE BALL OVER YOUR POINTER FINGER
AND I'LL PUT A COUPLING ON THIS OTHER END OVER HERE AND MAKE ALMOST A STRAIGHT SHOT
SO NOW TAKE HOW TO DO IT SIMPLE YOU JUST TAKE YOUR MARKER FOLLOW THE LINE MAKE IT A TWIST AND LET IT END RIGHT THERE
I STILL GOT A LITTLE BIT MORE OF SHAPING UP ON THIS NOSE THAT WOULD END UP BLEND IT RIGHT OFF
AS WE MOVE AROUND HERE KIND OF AN AWKWARD ANGLE BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE BLADE IS TOTALLY STRAIGHT AND AS WE SLOW IT DOWN READY TO MEET WITH THE OTHER END JUST SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND THE PIECE SHOULD JUST DROP RIGHT OUT
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT SOME SOCKS THAT ARE GOING TO BE STAYING UP SO YOU DON'T WANT THE SOCKS THAT END RIGHT ON YOUR ANKLE EITHER
THAT'S THE END OF IT OKAY
YOU HAVE THE STICK WHICH YOU'LL NOTICE IS CURVED INWARD BY A GREAT DEGREE THE HAIR AND AT THIS END THE KNOB TO TIGHTEN THE HAIR
DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT ALLOW YOU TO REALLY MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THINGS HAPPENING EXACTLY WHERE YOU WANT THEM TO START AND END WITH THE MASTER CHANNEL
THAT MAKES IT VERY EASY SO THAT YOU CAN SPECIFICALLY SAY WHEN YOU WANT THE TRACK TO END WHEN YOU WANT THE FADE- OUT TO START
A REAL HIGH END COLLECTION OF OUTBOARD GEAR BUT YOU PAY FOR THAT
THE THING ABOUT CHICKEN STOCK IS A VERY NEUTRAL STOCK SO IT WILL ALWAYS TAKE ON WHATEVER FLAVOR YOU END UP ADDING AND ONCE WE PUT THE FISH IN THAT CHICKEN FLAVOR WILL REALLY GO AWAY
AT THIS POINT AT MY CONSULTATION I WENT AHEAD AND TALKED WITH MY CLIENT AND I'M GOING TO END UP USING A FIRM GEL
PLEASE MAKE SURE IT'S CLOCKWISE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM WORKS AND YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO GO AGAINST THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM OR YOU MIGHT END UP WITH A LOT OF PROBLEMS
DOUBLE HEADED ALSO MEANS THAT YOU DO ONE MOVE WITH ONE END AND THEN IMMEDIATELY YOU WILL DO ANOTHER MOVE WITH THE OTHER END OF THE STICK
IT IS CALLED DOUBLE HEADED BECAUSE IT IS OF EQUAL THICKNESS THROUGHOUT THE STAFF ON EACH END
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I TOOK THIS DELAY PEDAL AND PUT IT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAIN I WOULD BE DISTORTING THE SOUND OF THE DELAY RATHER THAN IF I PUT IT AT THE END
THIS WAY WHEN YOU DO END UP GRINDING YOU'LL ALREADY HAVE HALF OF THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU'LL NEED AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF IT CLEANLY
YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH THIS HALF BALL AND TAKE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PART OF IT AND POINT IT UPWARDS
NOW USUALLY WHAT THEY DO IS THEY END UP REMEMBERING WHEN THEY WERE EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY-ONE YEARS OLD
IN THIS SEQUENCE WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING ON THE LOTUS SWEEP KICK WHICH SHOWS UP AT VERY END SEQUENCE IN THE YANG STYLE LONG FORM
TODAY IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO BE SHOWING YOU WHERE TO STICK THE BACK END OF THE BIKE WHILE DOING A 540 HURRICANE
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE A BUSY INDIVIDUAL AND YOU WANT TO HAVE A HEALTHY DIET SO SCHEDULE YOUR HEALTH END
SO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS WE ARE GOING TO ATTACH A DIFFUSER TO THE END OF A DRYER
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A GREAT ARTIST ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS ENJOY THE PROCESS OF BEING CREATIVE AND USE YOUR CREATIVITY IN A WAY THAT GIVE YOU SOME REWARDS AND IF YOU END UP SOMETHING THAT LOOKS GOOD WONDERFUL IF YOU END WITH SOMETHING THAT'S WONDERFUL YOU STILL LEARN SOMETHING YOU STILL HAD FUN YOU STILL GOT TO EXPRESS YOUR CREATIVITY AND YOU CAN ALWAYS DO ANOTHER ONE AND EVENTUALLY THEY'LL GET BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER
HI MY NAME IS WINDY CHALLEY WHEN PICKING OUT A HIGH END CHESS SET THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO CONSIDER
IN GENERAL HIGH END CHESS PIECES ARE SOLD SEPARATE FROM BOARDS
THAT WAS THE END OF THE DOORS AND THE BAND DECIDED TO BREAK UP AFTER THAT INSTANCE
ALRIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE HOLDING DOWN THE BASIC ROCK GROOVE IN WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN DOING AND WE'RE GOING TO BE CRASHING ON THE END OF FOUR NOW
SAME WAY WITH THE OTHER WAY YOU JUST WANT TO LET YOUR MUSCLES KIND OF RELAX AND THEN STOP AT THE END
AND BY THE END OF THE SERIES YOU'LL BECOME EVEN MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THE ACTUAL VIOLIN ITSELF THE NOTES AND THE STRINGS
IT IS MADE OF A DIFFERENT KIND OF WOOD AS I MENTIONED WHITE WAX WOOD AND IT IS TAPERED ON ONE END AND IT GETS THICKER TOWARDS THE BOTTOM ON THE OTHER END
THE LARKSHEAD KNOT ISN'T ALWAYS THE MOST STABLE KNOT BUT A WAY YOU CAN MAKE IT MORE STABLE IS SIMPLY BY PASSING ONE END OF THE ROPE THROUGH IT AGAIN AND THIS KIND OF MAKES IT FIND UP A LITTLE BIT WHICH CAN ALSO BE MORE DIFFICULT TO UNTIE BUT IT'S A LOT MORE STABLE
WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT UNDER OUR LOOP OVER UNDER BOTH LOOPS AND THEN BACK UNDER ITSELF AND THE STANDING END
THE ONLY REASON WE'RE BENDING IT BACKWARDS IS BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CUT AS CLOSE TO THE CIRCLE AT THE END AS WE CAN
AND THOSE ARE ALWAYS AT ODDS SO THEY TRY AND GET BOTH OF THEIR NEEDS MET AND END UP DOING NOTHING
SO AS AN INTERN REMEMBER YOU MAY START OFF DOING THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO DO BUT YOU WILL END UP WHERE YOU WANT TO BE
WHAT I'M GOING TO BE DOING IS I WILL OPEN UP THE SAW ITSELF THE BLADE ITSELF AND REMOVE IT FROM ONE END THE BASE END AND THAT WILL BE FED INTO A HOLE AND THEN I WILL PLACE IT BACK INTO THE HOLDER AGAIN THE SAW BLADE AND THEN TIGHTEN IT UP
SO MAKE SURE YOU'RE FLAT BASED YOU'RE LOOKING LOOKING LOOKING AND THEN WHEN YOU GET TO THE END YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO TURN DROP OFF STRAIGHT AND RIDE AWAY
SO WITH THE END OF YOUR YARN YOU'RE GOING TO WRAP IT AROUND YOUR FINGER WRAP IT AROUND YOUR FINGER AND THEN YOU GET THAT NICE LITTLE PRETZEL THING GOING
AND WITH YOUR NEEDLE YOU'RE GOING TO PULL YOUR YARN THROUGH AND HOLD ON TO YOUR END AND JUST PULL IT DOWN OVER THAT NEEDLE AND WE GET OUR FIRST LOOP
WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH SWEEP STROKES IS WIND BACK UP AT THE END
SO IF I WANT TO GO FROM SIDEWAYS I CAN ACTUALLY WIND UP BACK AGAIN AT THE TAIL END OF MY SWEEP AND THIS WILL KEEP THE BOAT FROM PULLING AROUND
I CAN PROBABLY LOWER MY SEAT A LITTLE BIT BUT WHEN YOU LOWER YOUR SEAT TO MUCH YOU END UP HAVING A PRETTY UNCOMFORTABLE RIDING POSITION
NOW AS YOU CAN SEE MY NAPKIN ISN'T EXACTLY GIVING ME AN INCH TO THE END SO I AM GOING TO JUST NOT DO AN INCH BUT JUST KIND OF EYE EACH ONE A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PRECISE UNTIL IT LOOKS NICE
AND THEN USING THE BLUR TOOLS AND THE SMUDGE TOOLS I'D TRY TO BLEND THAT IN A LITTLE MORE SO THAT WHAT WE'D END UP WITH IS SOMETHING THAT LOOKS A LOT LIKE A TEXTURE MAP
IT'S REALLY THE HIPS TURNING AT THE VERY END THAT DOES IT
DON'T FORGET YOUR COMB TOO WITH THE LITTLE END ON IT
NOW WHEN WE SHOOT WE'LL END UP WITH A VERY NICE MONOCHROMATIC CONTRASTY PORTRAIT STYLE
SO YOU WANT TO MAKE A LITTLE V WITH YOUR BODY AND THE FRONT END OF YOUR BIKE AND JUST KIND OF BALANCE THEM OFF
AND YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO PULL UP ENOUGH SO YOU GET THE FRONT END UP A LITTLE BIT
SO THE BASIC ELEMENTS TO THE MANUAL IS THAT YOU COUNTER BALANCE YOUR BODY WITH THE FRONT END OF YOUR BIKE
SOME PEOPLE PREFER TO USE TWO FINGERS OR OTHER FINGERS TO BRAKE AND THEY MAY END UP SLIDING THERE BRAKE LEVER OUT THIS WAY SO THAT IT IS MORE NATURAL TO HAVE THERE HAND ON THE END OF THE BAR PULL THE MIDDLE FINGER WITH TWO FINGERS BUT THAT IS NOT MY PREFERENCE
SO NOW THAT YOU HAVE THIS END CUT OFF AND YOU SEE THIS IS GOING TO COME OFF PRETTY EASILY
YOU'LL TRY TO STOP AND YOU'LL JUST ALL THE SNOW IS ON TOP OF YOUR BOARD AND YOU'LL JUST END UP TOPPLING OVER SO YOU HAVE GOT TO THINK OF HOW FAST YOU ARE GOING
SO THE REASON WHY WE'RE PUTTING THE STICKS IN WITH THE WOODEN SIDE IN FIRST IS ONE BECAUSE THE TIPS OF THE MATCHES GIVE A DECORATION TO THE STICK AND THE OTHER REASON IS BECAUSE THE TIP OF THE MATCH ALSO HELPS THE STICK FROM NOT GOING THROUGH ALL THE WAY TO THE END
ANYWAY YOU WOULD HAVE ONE CAR INSTEAD OF TWO AND IT IS EASIER INSTEAD OF TRYING TO CARPOOL ONE END TO THE OTHER
I'M GOING UP LIKE THIS A LITTLE BIT BUT I'M STILL GOING TO END UP BEING REALLY CLOSE
WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS GET YOUR CUTTER AND LEAVE ABOUT A QUARTER INCH OFF THE END HERE TRIM IT AND THEN GET YOUR NEEDLE NOSE PLIERS THAT HAVE THE LITTLE ROUND TIP NOSE GET THE END HERE AND I CURL IT AND PUT THE END THAT'S HERE INTO THE SILVER BEAD
AS YOU CAN SEE AT THE END OF THIS TRACK I'VE DONE A FADE-OUT VIA DRAWING IN ON THE MASTER CHANNEL
THERE'S A STRAIGHT END SHOT THERE'S THE BANK SHOT THERE'S THE KICK SHOT THERE'S THE COMBINATION SHOT THERE'S A SHOT OFF ONE BALL THERE'S A SNOOKER SHOT THERE'S A SAFETY SHOT AND THEN THERE'S A SCRATCH SHOT
SO BY DOING QIGONG WE LEARN TO MOVE THE BODY ALONG WITH MOVING THE ENERGY INSIDE OF US SO THAT WE CAN UNBLOCK THOSE AREAS THAT TEND TO ARE SLOW IN QI OR END UP BEING BLOCKED BY THE FLOW OF ENERGY
NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO ADD THE LOBSTER CLASP ONTO THE END OF YOUR BRACELET
OR SOMETHING THAT SAYS TARGET CREATURE GETS MINUS THREE MINUS THREE UNTIL END OF TURN
THIS WILL INSURE THAT MY REPEL DEVICE DOES NOT COME OFF THE END OF THE ROPE IN CASE THE ROPE DOESN'T HIT THE GROUND
THE FIRST THING I'M GOING TO DO WHEN REPELLING DOWN A CLIFF IS TIE A BIG KNOT IN THE END OF MY ROPES
IT GIVES YOU SOME FLEXIBILITY IF YOU DECIDE TO GO OVER THE FIFTEEN MINUTES WHETHER A TEAM IS HERE ON TIME OR NOT BUT THEY USUALLY LIKE TO GET THINGS STARTED RIGHT WHEN THE TIME OF THE GAME IS SCHEDULED AND THEY USUALLY LIKE TO END IT RIGHT WHEN THE TIME OF THE GAME IS SCHEDULED
DOWN HERE AT THE END WE HAVE CREATED A FLARE LOOK
NOW YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS IN BOTH CORNERS OF THE SHORT END WE ARE GOING TO PUT OUR HANDS TOGETHER AND FLIP OVER AGAIN FOLDING ONE CORNER ON TOP OF THE OTHER CORNER
THAT'S WHY A LOT OF PRODUCERS JUST WANT TO GET PAID UP FRONT AND DON'T EVEN WANT TO DEAL WITH THE STUFF ON THE BACK END
OKAY IF I MOVE THE FULCRUM ALL THE WAY BACK I'M LENGTHENING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE END OF THE BOARD AND MY FULCRUM
SO WHAT I USUALLY DO IS USE THE END OF THE PRESSER FOOT
AND AT THIS END WHICH IS CALLED THE FROG YOU HAVE THE KNOB TO TIGHTEN AND LOOSEN THE HAIR
SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL TRY TO GO AROUND YOU WHEN YOU ARE PARALLEL PARKING AND NOT REALIZING THAT YOUR FRONT END IS GOING TO SWING OUT
IF THERE IS ANYONE BEHIND YOU OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR THEM AS WELL AS YOU ARE PULLING INTO THE SPACE TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMEONE IS NOT GOING TO REAR END YOU
HOLD THAT GRASP THE CORNER AND THE END AND PULL THAT NICE AND STRAIGHT NOW THIS HAS A VERY STRETCHY RUFFLE SIDE YOU CAN JUST FOLD THAT DOWN LIKE THAT AND THEN AGAIN WE WANT TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THE TOP HERE AND JUST PULL IT AS STRAIGHT AS POSSIBLE
REMEMBER TO STAY NICE AND LOOSE BY STRETCHING AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE FULLY WARMED UP AND FULLY COOLED DOWN AT THE END OF YOUR WORKOUT
THE NEXT IS A CURVED BARBELL WHICH IS SIMILAR TO YOUR BELLY JEWEL IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE JEWEL ON THE END OF IT AND IT IS NOT AS BIG AT THE BOTTOM AND THE BALLS ARE THE SAME SIZE AND BOTH SCREW ON AND SCREW OFF
