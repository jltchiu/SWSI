IF YOU'RE AN ACCURATE OR AGGRESSIVE PLAYER YOU WOULD SAY FIVE BUT THE RISK IS IF YOU DO GET A BAD BREAK IN ONE OF THESE SUITS THEN YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE A TRICK THAT YOU WERE COUNTING ON SO I WOULD SAY FOR THE NEWER PLAYER OR EVEN FOR THE EXPERIENCED PLAYER AS FAR AS BEING SAFE A FOUR BID IS COMFORTABLE
OH AND USUALLY IT'S SEWN A LOT RIGHT HERE RIGHT AROUND THIS SEAM BUT YOU JUST BREAK THOSE THREADS

I SAY IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHOEVER HAS THE BREAK ACTUALLY HAS CONTROL OF THE TABLE AT THAT POINT IN TIME
OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO IN TO THE MOST IMPORTANT SHOT IN THE GAME AND THAT'S THE BREAK
AND IF YOU BROKE THEM UP REALLY GOOD BUT YOU DIDN'T POCKET A BALL AND YOU TURN CONTROL OF THE TABLE OVER TO YOUR OPPONENT ALL YOU'VE DONE IS OPEN EVERYTHING UP SO THAT YOUR OPPONENT HAS AN EASY ROAD TO RUN OUT AND BEAT YOU OFF OR YOUR OWN BREAK
HOWEVER IF YOU DON'T BREAK PROPERLY AND SAY YOU SCRATCH ON THE BREAK OR YOU DON'T POCKET A BALL ALL YOU'RE DOING AT THAT POINT IS JUST TURNING CONTROL OVER THE TABLE TO YOUR OPPONENT
SO THE OBJECTIVE ON THE BREAK IS TO OF COURSE POCKET AT LEAST ONE BALL WHICH IS THEN GOING TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY AT THE TABLE AND TRY TO POCKET MORE BALLS
WHAT MAKES A GOOD BREAK
