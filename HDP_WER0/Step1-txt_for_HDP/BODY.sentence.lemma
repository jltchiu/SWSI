OKAY NOW START HERE WITH YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD UNTIL YOU'VE GOT YOUR BODY TOTALLY ADJUSTED
NOW WHEN YOU'RE DOING SINGLES YOU HAVE A TENDENCY TO KIND OF ROCK THE BODY SO YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT
WHEN IT GRABS IT WILL GRIP BUT AS YOU LOOSEN YOUR BODY WEIGHT OFF OF IT ON YOUR OTHER LINE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SLIDE THIS DOWN AND KEEP USING THIS LINE
ONCE I'VE MASTERED THAT I FEEL COMFORTABLE I CAN START TO EXTEND THE BODY FURTHER BY EXTENDING THROUGH THE HIPS AND THAT'S WHEN YOU'LL REALLY FEEL THAT RECTUS ABDOMINUS AND TRANSVERSE ABDOMINUS PULL IN TIGHT
USE THESE EXERCISES TO DEVELOP GOOD POWERFUL STRONG LOWER BODY
SO KEEP THAT IN MIND AND WHEN YOU'RE STRENGTHENING YOUR WHOLE UPPER BODY AND MAKE THIS A JOYFUL PRACTICE AND NOT JUST AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT ONE ESPECIALLY AGAIN FOR THE GIRLS
THE OTHER IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THE UPPER BODY ENCOMPASSES THE FOURTH CHAKRA WHICH IS THE HEART CHAKRA
IN YOGA THEY SAY THAT IF YOUR UPPER BODY IS STRONG YOU CAN GIVE AND YOU CAN RECEIVE HUGE BLESSINGS
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BODY IS LINED UP PROPERLY
REMEMBER THE MORE OXYGEN IN YOUR BODY THE MOST YOU CAN STRETCH
SO I'M GOING TO GO UP AND I'M GOING TO GO DOWN AND RELEASE MY BODY AND STRETCH IT UP
SO THIS CLOP RIGHT HERE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU ABOUT HIP MOVEMENT IT'S ALL ABOUT WHERE THE BODY IS
SHE IS GOING TO ROLL HER PALMS AWAY FROM HER BODY AND SHE IS GOING TO EXTEND HER ARMS OUT AND LOCK THOSE ELBOWS AND KIND OF ROLL IT HER BACK A LITTLE BIT

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INTERMEDIATE FLOOR GYMNASTICS AND WE'VE COVERED OUR STRETCHING AND OUR WARM-UPS TO AVOID INJURY AND THE NEXT THING I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WAS WAS YOUR YOUR BODY POSITIONS MAINLY YOUR HEAD POSITION
YOUR HEAD IS REALLY THE KEY TO WHERE THE REST OF YOUR BODY IS GOING
WHATEVER YOUR HEAD IS DOING REALLY DETERMINES WHAT THE REST OF YOUR BODY WILL BE DOING
REMEMBER TO ROLL IT AROUND YOUR BODY SO YOU DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP AND TURN BLACK AND BLUE ALL RIGHT
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HYDRATE FOR YOUR CELLS YOUR BRAIN FUNCTION AND DETOXIFYING YOUR BODY AND LOSING THE WEIGHT
YOUR BODY IS ALMOST HALF WATER AND IF YOUR ARE EXERCISING EVEN TEN MINUTES TO TWENTY MINUTES A DAY IF YOU ARE OVER TWO HUNDRED POUNDS YOU ARE LOSING WATER
THE SKIN AROUND YOUR EYES IS THE THINNEST AND MOST DELICATE SKIN AROUND YOUR ENTIRE BODY AND ALSO HAS VERY LITTLE MOISTURE TO IT
AND THESE ARE THE AREAS OF THE BODY THAT SWING FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND GO UP AND DOWN
THE THE BODY MOVES THE KNEES ARE SWIVELING THAT WAY HIPS THAT WAY
NOW IF YOU'RE SWINGING YOUR BODY YOU'VE GOT TOO MUCH WEIGHT
YOU ARE GOING TO PRESS BACK AND KEEP YOUR HANDS FIRMLY ON YOUR THIGHS AND THEN RELAX THE BODY FORWARD
DOWN THE ENTIRE BODY TAKE THE HANDS UP INTO THE HAIR MASSAGE THE HEAD JUST A LITTLE BIT
THESE ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT FROM GRAPHIC DESIGN OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO HAVE A BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF DIMENSIONS SHAPES IN TERMS OF THE HUMAN FORM AND ALSO MOVEMENT THAT'S THE KEY AS WELL TO CREATE PANELS IN A COMIC STRIP OR ESPECIALLY TO CREATE ANIMATION AND TO BE A HAND DRAWN ANIMATOR WHICH IT IS KIND OF A RARE BREED THESE DAYS BUT TO BE EITHER ONE YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN FORM HOW THE BODY MOVES AND TO BE ABLE TO DRAW WITHIN THOSE PARAMETERS
THIS IS A PICASSO PAINTING AND THIS IS USING THE LINE AS A CONTOUR TO SHOW YOU WHAT THE SHAPE OF THE BODY IS SO THIS IS A CONTOUR LINE
ULTIMATELY YOU JUST WANT TO LET THE HEAD RELAX AND LET THE BODY RELAX AND LET THE PRESSURE FEEL GOOD
WE HOLD A LOT OF TENSION IN ALL THE SOFT TISSUES OF THE ORGANS AND SO IF YOU HAVE HARDNESS OR STIFFNESS OR A FEELING OF CONGESTION IN THIS PART OF THE BODY THIS HELPS TO JUST SOFTEN THAT AREA WHETHER YOU NEED HELP WITH DIGESTION OR ELIMINATION OR YOU JUST NEED TO RELAX THERE
TO START WITH YOUR FEET ARE AT A SHOULDER DISTANCE YOU'RE GOING TO TURN YOUR BODY TO THE RIGHT AS YOU'RE TURNING TO THE RIGHT YOUR RIGHT HEEL TURNS AND YOUR LEFT FOOT TURNS ON THE BALL OF THE FOOT
SEE HOW MY BODY IS ROTATING AND MAKING THE BOAT GO FORWARD
AND THAT WAY I'M USING THE CORE MUSCLES IN MY BODY TO DO THE PADDLING
AGAIN THAT FORCES MY BODY TO ROTATE WITH THE PADDLE
OKAY FOR THE ADVANCED FORWARD STROKE WHAT I WANT TO DO IS ROTATE MY BODY
OK NOW THAT'S THE BODY OF OUR DRAGON
YOU CAN EVEN PUT A LITTLE EXTRA GLUE HERE AND PULL THESE FEATHERS DOWN TO KIND OF BLEND INTO THE BODY
HER BODY CORD HERE WHICH GOES UNDER THE ARM AND HER MASK CLIP
SO THESE EXERCISES THAT I AM GOING TO DEMONSTRATE WILL DEFINITELY STRENGTHEN YOUR WHOLE BODY
AS THE BODY TURNS TO FALL AWAY FROM ME I JUST FOLLOW IT UP STEPPING THROUGH
TURN YOUR BODY NOW DON'T GO DOWN JUST YET
HI I'M TRISTAN MCCAULEY FROM LUCKY SEVEN TATOO AND I'M HERE JUST TO GIVE YOU A FEW FACTS ABOUT BODY PIERCING JEWELRY
SO I'VE STRETCHED OUT MY LEGS THOUGH YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IT BUT YOU ARE WORKING YOUR OTHER BODY PARTS SOMETIMES WHILE YOU ARE RUNNING
ROUNDING OUT THE UPPER BACK KEEPING THE LOWER BACK STRAIGHT COLLAPSING THE CHEST IN HEAD INTO MY ARMS AND I ALSO STRETCH OUT MY UPPER BODY AS WELL
IF YOU'VE PUMPED YOUR ARMS YOU MIGHT GET A LITTLE STIFF IN YOUR UPPER BODY AS WELL
PLUS RUNNING IS A HIGH IMPACT ENDEAVOR SO IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO STRETCH YOUR UPPER BODY
HOWEVER THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS TO STRETCH WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING ARE OF COURSE YOUR LOWER BODY YOUR LEGS
AND SO I LIKE TO TAKE THEM ALL MY BUNDLED STRINGS THAT I'M GOING TO THROW OUT AND JUST PUT THEM BACK INTO THE BOX THAT THE NEW STRINGS CAME FROM AND THAT WILL KEEP THOSE SHARP ENDS FROM POKING OUT AND GETTING IN YOUR BODY
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT MY BODY POSITION IS IN FRONT OF THE HAIR THAT I'M ACTUALLY CUTTING
IF THE DOG IS TRYING TO AVOID COUGHING WHEN COUGHING BECOMES VERY UNCOMFORTABLE THE DOG CAN START TO AVOID COUGHING BY TAKING SHALLOW BREATHS AND THE MORE SHALLOW BREATH THEY TAKE THE LESS OXYGEN IS COMING IN AND IT WILL ACTUALLY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF BLOOD OXYGEN IN THEIR BODY
THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MOVE FOR ANYBODY A TOTAL BODY MOVEMENT
SO WITH THE 40D YOU HAVE A CAP OVER THE BODY OF THE CAMERA PROTECTING THE SENSOR AND THE SHUTTER FROM ANY LIGHT OR DUST
THERE IS ALWAYS DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN TARGET THE SAME MUSCLES AND EVEN THE SAME SPOTS IN THOSE MUSCLE FIBERS DIFFERENTLY THAT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO SHOCK THE BODY SO THE BODY IS GOING TO RESPOND
IF YOU ARE DOING THE SAME THING TIME AND TIME AGAIN EVENTUALLY THE BODY IS GOING TO STOP RESPONDING TO THOSE WORKOUTS
HI THIS IS AARON HALE AT FITNESS FOR LIFE HERE IN WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA HERE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO GAIN UPPER BODY STRENGTH
FIRST AND FOREMOST IF WE ARE TRYING TO GAIN UPPER BODY STRENGTH THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO IS GET ON A WORKOUT SCHEDULE THAT WE KNOW WE CAN ADHERE TO AND MAINTAIN A CONSISTENT WORKOUT WITH
BUT YOU WANT TO START LOOKING TO YOUR INSIDE SHOULDER WHICH EVER WAY YOU NATURALLY WAY YOU WANT TO SPIN AND AS YOU COME IN YOU POP AND YOU PUSH THE BIKE THROUGH BUT YOU MAKE SURE TO KEEP LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER CAUSE YOU BODY BASICALLY WILL FOLLOW WHEREVER YOU LOOKS SO AS LONG AS YOU KEEP LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LAND JUST FINE
ANOTHER THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO TAKE YOUR HIPS AND ROLL THEM UP A LITTLE BIT OKAY UPPER BODY ARMS EXTENDED OVER YOUR HEAD HANDS TOGETHER EYES LOOKING AT THE HAND
WE'RE GOING TO COME ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE BODY AND CROSS
THE HEAT GETS TRAPPED IN YOUR BODY FROM THE HOT WATER AND IT CAN SPARK A FLARE UP
THEY'RE NOT ATTACHED TO THEIR MAIN BODY
NOW UP TO THIS POINT WE'VE LOOKED AT HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN CLAY BODY BASED ON HIGHLY PROCESSED INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS BUT BECAUSE CLAY IS A NATURALLY OCCURRING SUBSTANCE AND IT EXISTS RIGHT IN THE GROUND WE CAN DIG IT OUT OF THE GROUND AND USE IT AS IS
WHAT I WANT TO DO INSTEAD OF JUST PULLING AND PUSHING WITH MY ARMS WHEN I REACH FORWARD SEE HOW MY WHOLE BODY ROTATES FORWARD LIKE THIS
MY TORSO THE MUSCLES ARE A LOT LARGER AND STRONGER THAN IN MY ARMS SO I WANT TO USE MY TORSO MUSCLES THE CENTER CORE MUSCLES IN MY BODY TO PROPEL MY KAYAK DOWN THE RIVER
NOW IF YOU'RE KAYAKING YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO ROTATE YOUR BODY INSTEAD OF USING YOUR ARMS
JUST A LIGHT ROCKING ACTION ADJUST MY BODY TO THE OTHER WING
SO REALLY GETTING LOW AND STAYING LOW AND TRYING TO FORCE YOUR BODY WEIGHT DOWN TO THE WHEELS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN MAKES A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE IN HOW STABLE YOU RIDE AND HOW SUCCESSFUL YOU ARE WHEN YOU ARE TRYING
SO IT'S THE SAME THING WITH YOU THE BODY JUST LIKE A VEHICLE YOU'RE RUNNING IT YOUR PUSHING IT HARD
THERE'S A THING CALLED BODY GLIDE AND ANY OTHER KIND OF A SLIPPERY OILY SUBSTANCE THAT YOU CAN PUT ON A CHAFE POINT SO TYPICALLY PUTTING A LITTLE BIT OF VASELINE OR PETROLEUM JELLY UNDERNEATH YOUR ARM PITS ON YOUR INNER THIGHS PERHAPS ON YOUR TOES OR AROUND YOUR NECK ARE GOOD POINTS TO PREVENT CHAFING
MAKE SURE YOU BUY CLOTHING THAT FITS YOUR BODY STYLE THAT FITS YOUR ACTIVITY LEVEL
THAT WAY YOUR BODY GETS A NICE AND YOUR FULL MUSCLES THERE IS BLOOD GOING TO EVERY PART OF THE MUSCLE FROM YOUR HEAD GOING DOWN THEN YOU PREVENT A LOT OF INJURIES FROM HAPPENING
NOW IF I MARK OR NOTE THAT I CAN GO BACK AND PUT A LARGER SCREW IN OR REPLACE THE WORN OUT INSERT THAT'S IN THE BODY
SO I DON'T WANT YOU TO HURT YOUR BACK AND THINK THAT I WAS GIVING YOU SOMETHING DANGEROUS TO DO SO JUST BE VERY CAUTIOUS LISTEN TO YOUR BODY BECAUSE YOUR BODY KNOWS BEST

YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY I DON'T LIKE THAT BECAUSE ALL HE HAS TO DO NOW IS REVERSE THIS JUST GRAB MY ARM PULL IT AGAINST HIS BODY AND HE'S GOT ME IN AN ARM BAR
I'M GOING TO END THIS SESSION BY COVERING UP THE BODY
THEY ARE ACTUALLY CHEMICAL REACTIONS IN THE BODY AND WHAT WE NOW KNOW IS THAT WE HAVE OVER 27 DIFFERENT EMOTIONAL REACTIONS EVERY WAKING HOUR OF EVERY DAY
I WANT TO USE MY ENTIRE BODY AND ROLL OUT OVER THE THUMB
USING MY ENTIRE BODY I BREAK FREE
SO FOCUSING ON GETTING HEALTHIER FOODS AND THAT MEANS BASICALLY REDUCING YOUR PROCESSED FOODS LOOKING AT GETTING A DIET THAT IS RICH IN VEGETABLES RICH IN HEALTHY FATS WHICH IS GOING TO HELP YOUR SKIN MAINTAINING A GOOD HEALTHY MICRO-SYSTEM IN YOUR INTESTINES TO HELP AGAIN WITH YOUR SKIN AND NOURISHING YOUR LIVER AND ALL THE OTHER PARTS OF YOUR BODY
BUT IF YOU FOCUS ON CONCENTRATING ON INDIVIDUAL BODY PARTS IT WILL HELP AS A WHOLE BODY RELAXATION
FEEL YOUR BODY PARTS WHERE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE AND WITH REPETITION YOUR MUSCLE MEMORY IS GOING TO REPEAT THE MOVE AND IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU MAKE A BETTER GOLF SWING
NOW THEN I'M GOING TO TWIST THEM LIKE THIS JUST IN THE CENTER AND THEN JUST THREAD THEM THROUGH THE BODY
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS WITH REALLY WIDE FEET BECAUSE IF I NEED TO MOVE MY BODY AROUND I NEED TO HAVE SOME MOBILITY WITH ME SO I GET KIND OF A NARROW BASE
AND IF YOUR EXERCISE IS TO WARM UP YOU'RE MOSTLY GOING TO BE WARMING UP YOUR WRIST CAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE THE PART OF YOUR BODY THAT'S GOING TO BE USING IT THE MOST AND YOUR FINGERS OKAY BELIEVE OR NOT
SO WE'RE GOING TO COME IN TURN FACING EACH OTHER GINA'S GOING TO COME INTO HER FULL LOTUS OR PADMASANA AND I'M GOING TO ASK GINA TO LIFT HER KNEES USING HER ABDOMINALS IN TO HER BODY
ONCE YOUR BODY RELAXES AND YOU GET A GOOD NAP YOU MAY JUST SLEEP ALL NIGHT SO YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SET YOUR ALARM CLOCK
WHEN YOU HIT JUST ABOVE THE KNEE YOU WILL SHOW A VERY NICE LONG LEAN LEG NO MATTER WHAT YOUR BODY TYPE IS
AND THERE ARE A FEW CERTAIN THINGS THAT PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT A LOT WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT TRYING TO BUILD UP STRENGTH IN THEIR UPPER BODY ESPECIALLY FOR US GIRLS
HI SO IN THIS SERIES WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT YOGA FOR STRENGTHENING THE UPPER BODY
FROM HERE I'M GOING TO BRING THE FOOT DOWN STEP OUT BOW THE RIGHT HAND PERFORMS SCRAPING BLOCK AND THEN THE BODY SNAPS INTO SIDE PUNCH
SO WE'LL JUST WRITE MYSPACE FOR THE SUBJECT AND YOU CAN WRITE WHATEVER YOU WANT ANY UPDATES ON FAMILY THINGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND SO I'M JUST GOING TO TYPE IN A LITTLE THING RIGHT HERE AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE DONE TYPING THE BODY OF YOUR BULLETIN GO AHEAD AND COME DOWN HERE
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GRAB THE BASE OF THE BODY AND THE PANTS TOGETHER AS WELL AS THE BACK OF THE NECK OF YOUR SCARECROW AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO PUT HIM IN YOUR CHAIR LET HIM SLIDE DOWN AND IF YOU HAVE HIM STUFFED PROPERLY HE'S JUST GOING TO STAND UP ON HIS OWN AND YOU HAVE YOUR HEAD PINNED ON SECURELY THAT'S GOING TO STAND UP AS WELL
AND THEN WE WILL JUST CONTRACT THE UPPER BODY SO THE UNDULATION GOES OUT OF YOUR BODY
SO IT'S LIKE YOU'RE HAVING SOMETHING INSIDE YOUR BODY AND YOU LET IT GO OUT
YOU MAKE THIS UNDULATION TRAVEL FROM YOUR KNEES TO YOUR HIPS FROM YOUR HIPS TO YOUR UPPER BODY UNTIL IT GOES OUT
A VACCINATION IS PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS DOING IS BUILDING IMMUNITY OF THE CAT'S BODY TOWARD VIRAL INFECTIONS
YOU CAN GET A FULL TAN BODY TAN IN LESS THEN A MINUTE AND THAT WILL USUALLY LAST YOU ANYWHERE UP TO A WEEK
SO WHAT I AM DOING NOW IS I AM GOING TO BRING THE KNEE ACROSS MY BODY AND THEN THRUST IT STRAIGHT INTO YOU WITH THE BACK LEG SIDE KICK
I AM GOING TO BRING THE KNEE RIGHT UNDER MY BODY AND ONCE IT COMES ACROSS THIS FOOT HAS TO PIVOT HARD AND FAR
THE BEST PLACE TO START FINDING MISALIGNMENTS IN YOUR BODY IS IN YOUR STANDING POSES
SO WE WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THE BODY HAS TO SAY TO US WHILE WE'RE TALKING IN OUR STANDING POSES
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE THE STRENGTH AND BALANCE AND THEN WE'LL WORK UP THE BODY RE-ALIGNING AGAIN IN ANATOMICAL POSITION SO THAT YOU CAN START TO RE-ALIGN YOUR SKELETAL STRUCTURE
IT'S THE FIRST PLACE THAT YOU'LL BEGIN TO NOTICE IMBALANCES FROM THE RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR BODY TO THE LEFT SIDE OF YOUR BODY THE FRONT SIDE OF YOUR BODY TO THE BACK SIDE OF YOUR BODY
IT SHEATHES THE BODY
ONE THING THAT I'VE NOTICED ABOUT BODY BOARDS IS IF YOU GET A BAD ONE FROM A GARAGE SALE
SO THINK ABOUT CROSSING OVER THE BODY AND DROPPING BACK DOWN KEEP THE ELBOWS REALLY TIGHT AND STABLE
NICE STRONG MOTION ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE BODY
HIPS TUCKED UNDER KNEE IN LINE WITH THE TOE YOU'RE TWISTING AWAY FROM THE BODY INTO THAT KNEE AND COMING ACROSS THAT PATH
NUMBER ONE STRENGTHENING THE UPPER BODY IS NOT JUST ABOUT STRENGTHENING YOUR ARMS
TILL YOU GET AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN FAR AWAY FROM THE LIP YOUR WEIGHT WILL KIND OF GET BACK THIS WAY AND LEAN YOUR BODY WEIGHT OUT TOWARDS THE RAMP
THE RULES ARE NUMBER ONE YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR ELBOWS NEXT TO YOUR BODY
WE WANT TO BE WITH BOTH OF OUR ELBOWS NEXT TO OUR BODY MEANING THEY'RE NOT OUT IN FRONT AND THEY'RE NOT BEHIND
WHEN BOTH OF OUR ELBOWS ARE NEXT TO OUR BODY THEY CREATE A RIGHT ANGLE HERE LIKE AN L AND OUR HANDS CAN TOUCH
A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO KEEP THEIR LENSES STORED IN A CASE TO PROTECT THEM INSTEAD OF LEAVING THEM ON THEIR CAMERA BODY BECAUSE THEY'RE EXPENSIVE
AS MY BODY COMES TO POSITION THE SWORD COMES TO POSITION
OKAY NOW I'M READY TO TAKE THE CLUB BACK PROPERLY AND TO PUT PROPER POWER FROM THE BODY INTO HITTING THE BALL
THERE'S VERY FEW GREAT PLAYERS THAT HAVE BAD GRIPS BECAUSE THE GRIP IS LIKE THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE CLUB IS CONNECTED TO THE BODY AND THAT'S HOW THE BODY IS CONNECTED TO THE CLUB
FOR EXAMPLE THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO RECENTLY COUNTED A STUDY THAT SHOWED THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE LONELY TEND TO HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF THE FIRE-FLIGHT OR FIGHT CHEMICALS THAT WE PRODUCE WHEN WE'RE UNDER STRESS AND IT'S KIND OF A CHRONIC THING AND OVER TIME THEY'VE FOUND THAT CAN CAUSE INFLAMMATION IN THE BODY AND CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A WHOLE RANGE OF HEALTH DISORDERS
BUT THE IDEA IS THAT HAVING COMPANIONSHIP AND FRIENDSHIP IN A PERSON'S LIFE IS IMPORTANT FOR CONTRIBUTING TO OVERALL HEALTH OF YOUR PHYSICAL BODY
I PUT ALL MY BODY WEIGHT INTO THAT AND I TRY TO TRANSFER IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE HEEL OF MY LEFT HAND
STEP FIVE INSTEAD OF STEPPING BACK HERE WE'RE GOING TO LEAN ONTO OUR LEFT HAND THROW ALL OUR BODY WEIGHT HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO KICK OUT WITH OUR LEFT LEG
SO TO KIND OF TO KIND OF STOP THAT AND RESET YOUR BODY IS TO BREATHE SLOWLY BECAUSE THAT KIND OF TAKES YOUR BODY OUT OF THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT MODE WHICH IS TO BREATHE SHALLOW FREQUENT BREATHS
BASICALLY IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE CHRONICALLY STRESSED OUT AND YOU'RE FEELING THAT STRESS LEVEL TO KIND OF YOU'LL TAKE THE CHRONIC STRESS A LOT OF TIMES WHAT IT DOES IS IT RAISES THAT FIGHT OR FLIGHT SYNDROME RESPONSE IN YOUR BODY
GRAB BY THE SIDES LEAN BACK SLIGHTLY GRAB WITH AN OVERHAND GRIP BRING THE ELBOWS CLOSE TO THE BODY AND ROW IT BACK SQUEEZING THE SHOULDER BLADES TOGETHER
HYDRATION IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO GETTING YOURSELF OUT OF OBESITY BECAUSE IT CLEANS THE TOXINS OUT OF YOUR BODY
SO JUST A COUPLE THINGS OF YOU NEED TO REMEMBER MAKE SURE IN A HEAD FIRST ENTRY YOUR SHOULDERS OR YOUR HANDS ARE ABOVE YOUR SHOULDER MAKE SURE YOUR HANDS TOUCH FIRST AND FEET FIRST MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FEET TOUCH FIRST AND DON'T TWIST YOUR BODY
WHEN YOU ARE HOLDING A GOOD SQUAT YOUR CORE IS REALLY HOLDING YOUR BODY INTO POSITION CORRECTLY
SO THERE'S TWO WAYS OF SHOWING THAT IT'S GIVING TWO WAYS FOR THE BODY TO BE SHOWN AS IN LIKE A TYPICAL HOUR GLASS CUT IN SHAPE
IT'S BASICALLY THE BELTED WAY IS JUST REINFORCING THAT THE BODY CURVES IN
AND NOT HAVING TO TURN THE BODY
ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOUR BODY AND WHENEVER YOUR BODY IS TALKING TO YOU WHETHER IT IS TELLING YOU PAIN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ALWAYS REMEMBER TO FOLLOW WHAT YOUR BODY SAYS
THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE FACTS ABOUT BODY PIERCING JEWELRY
THIS IS EILEEN DEY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND IN THIS SEGMENT WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT THE MERIDIAN CHANNELS ARE WITHIN THE HUMAN BODY
A LOT OF KIDS MAYBE DON'T WANT TO GO RUNNING SO HIP-HOP DANCE IS A GREAT WAY TO GET OUT ALL THEIR ENERGIES AND UTILIZE ALL THEIR DIFFERENT MUSCLES AND DO DIFFERENT THINGS WITH THEIR BODY
AND YOU MIGHT THINK THIS IS INFREQUENT BUT IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS QUITE A LOT AND YOU REALLY LEARN TO DEVELOP A REALLY STRONG AMOUNT OF BREATH COMING OUT OF YOUR BODY INTO THE SHAKLEHATCHI SO YOU CAN ALWAYS MAINTAIN A NOTE NO MATTER HOW MUCH WIND IS BEING BLOWN AGAINST YOU WHICH COULD BE VERY DISTURBING
TAKE YOUR RIGHT ARM DOWN GET OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BODY BY REACHING UP WITH THAT LEFT HAND
YOU'LL WANT TO SET UP YOUR UPPER BODY TO ALMOST BE WHERE YOU WANT TO LAND IN THE TRICK
YOUR MANUALING AND YOUR UPPER BODY AND YOUR SHOULDERS ARE GOING TO PREDICT THE DIRECTION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TURN
ONE WAY TO DO THIS IS TO SET UP IN THE MANUAL POSITION SO THAT YOUR BODY IS TURNED JUST BEFORE YOU 180 OUT
SO NOT ONLY CAN YOU SPRAY YOUR BODY YOU CAN SPRAY THE ROOM YOU CAN SPRAY YOUR CAR YOU CAN SPRAY ANYTHING YOU WANT
NOTICE MY HANDS ARE NOT TO THE SIDE BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE CORRECT BODY POSITION
IN THIS SECTION WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LOWER BODY MECHANICS AS YOU'RE APPROACHING A FIVE ZERO ON A HANDRAIL FEATURE
IT'S A GOOD ALL OVER BODY TONING AND STRENGTHENING EXERCISE
IF YOU JUST DO NOTHING ELSE BUT DO A SUN SALUTATION THAT WILL STRETCH YOUR ENTIRE BODY
THIS WILL BE MAKING A SMOOTH TURN AS OPPOSED TO SWITCHING MY BODY AROUND
WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE SWITCHING OUR BODY AROUND WE ARE ACTUALLY LETTING THE SKIS WORK WITH THEIR NATURAL SHAPE
AS YOU CAN NOTICE YOU CAN SEE THE SKI TRACKS WHERE I WENT IT IS A SMOOTH LINE THERE I AM NOT SWITCHING MY BODY AROUND IT WILL BE A LOT FASTER AND A LOT MORE EFFECTIVE WAY TO SKI
MAKE SURE YOUR BODY STAYS IN ALIGNMENT
SO BASICALLY YOUR BODY MASS INDEX IS FIGURED UP FROM YOUR HEIGHT AND YOUR WEIGHT AND HOW MUCH OF THAT IS BODY FAT
MY EYES ARE ALWAYS FORWARD MY BODY IS RELAXED I'M MOVING FROM MY CENTER
ARMS OUT AWAY FROM THE BODY
IN ORDER TO REALLY FOR THE OPTIMUM STYLE OF PLAYING IS TO KEEP YOUR BODY ERECT LIKE THIS WHERE YOU'RE SIMPLY STRAIGHTFORWARD YOU'RE NOT SLOUCHING BECAUSE WHEN YOU SLOUCH YOU INHIBIT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO PLAY THE INSTRUMENT AS OPPOSED IF YOU'RE STANDING YOU CAN MANIPULATE YOUR INSTRUMENT MUCH BETTER
BODY IS SQUARE
WHAT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO WITH BODY BOARDS IS YOUR WEIGHT YOUR HEIGHT AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON THE WAVES.IF YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BE FLOUNDERING AROUND IN THE WHITE WATER ALL YOU REALLY NEED IS SOMETHING TO HOLD YOU UP AND KEEP YOU AFLOAT
HI MY NAME IS MIKE SANDERS AND I'M GOING TO BE TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT BODY BOARD FOR YOU
NOW SHE IS GOING TO ROLL THE BODY BACK LOAD AND I'M GOING TO STEP BACK AND THIS RIGHT HAND TURNS DOWN LEAD HOOK UPPER CUT
SO THIS IS A MOVING COMBINATION AGAIN DEVELOPING THIS ABILITY TO TWIST SET UP AND HAVE PROPER BODY MECHANICS AS WE ARE PUNCHING
SO NOW WHAT THAT ENTAILS IS YOU'VE GOT TO REALLY REALLY BE SYNCED UP WITH YOUR WHOLE BODY GOING FROM YOU KNOW FROM YOUR OSTINATO ALL THE WAY TO YOUR HI HAT
THE SQUAT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST OVERALL EFFECTIVE EXERCISES IN TRAINING LET ALONE TO IMPROVE MUSCULATURE OF THE LOWER BODY
A BODY WEIGHT SQUAT AGAIN HEELS AT OR SLIGHTLY WIDER THAN SHOULDERS WIDTH
KEEPING THE CHEST AND BODY IN A GOOD UPRIGHT POSITION
I'LL JUST CLEAN UP THE BOTTOM A LITTLE BIT AND THEN WE'LL GO WHEN IT'S LEATHER HARD WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A STONE TO IT AND WE'RE GOING TO VARNISH THE BODY ALL HERE AND BY VARNISHING IT IT'S GOING TO GIVE IT IT JUST SHINES UP THE CLAY SURFACE AND IT MAKES IT MAKES IT REAL PRETTY AND SHINY AND THEN YOU CAN JUST YOU CAN YOU CAN JUST FIRE IT WITH JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SMOKE OR YOU CAN PUT HORSE HAIR ON IT AND MAKE IT LITTLE DESIGNS WITH THE BURNING HORSE HAIR
INSTEAD JUST PUT THE CLEANSER ON YOUR HAND AND USE THAT TO WIPE OVER YOUR BODY OR TO CLEANSE YOURSELF
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THAT BECAUSE THAT IS RIGHT INSIDE THE SPIDER'S BODY
BECAUSE NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING THE BODY IS PUTTING OUT THESE LIQUIDS
AND THEN TO FIND CHATURANGA IN A KNEELING POSITION IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO FULL POSITION WE'LL SHIFT SLOWLY FORWARD LOWERING OUR ELBOWS TIGHT TO THE BODY
IT'S KIND OF ONE OF THE AREAS YOU CAN BE A LITTLE BRIGHT AND CHEERFUL ON THE SCARECROW BODY
AND THAT'S JUST YOU KNOW PUT THE STRINGS THROUGH THE BODY
IT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING EVERYONE DOES WANT TO LEARN AS OPPOSED TO SWITCHING YOUR BODY SIDEWAYS BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO MAKE YOU A BETTER ALL AROUND SKIER
THE DIFFERENCE IS INSTEAD LAYING SO MUCH PRESSURE ON THIS FOOT AND SWITCHING YOUR BODY AROUND YOU ARE GOING TO PUT FORWARD PRESSURE ON YOUR BOOT WHICH IS GOING TO ALLOW THE INSIDE EDGE OF THE SKI TO WORK BY ITSELF AND CARVE THE TURN OUT
MAKE SURE YOUR FEET ARE EVENLY SPACED AND YOUR BODY IS CENTERED RIGHT OVER YOUR FEET
IT ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR BREATHING TO YOUR THOUGHTS TO THE SENSATIONS IN YOUR BODY IN ORDER TO BE SAFE AND IN ORDER TO KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GO FROM THAT MOMENT ON
THE TAIL IS GOING TO BE FAIRLY THIN SO JUST GOING TO KINDA TAPER IT BACK HERE AND MAYBE GO BACK JUST A LITTLE BIT BACK PAST THE EYE OF THE HOOK JUST TO GIVE THE BODY A LITTLE BIT MORE LENGTH AND THEN JUST KINDA TIE IT OFF AND SEE HOW IT KINDA FLARES THAT TAIL OUT A LITTLE BIT
WHEN YOU DO THE TOSS YOU SHIFT THE WEIGHT FROM YOUR RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR BODY TO YOUR LEFT SIDE OF YOUR BODY AND YOU JUST BRING YOUR ARM UP
SO I SLIDE UP BASE MY BODY KEEP MY BODY LEVEL HERE KEEP MY HANDS UP THROW THE RIGHT LEG LEAD SIDE KICK STEP FORWARD SHIFT REVERSE PUNCH TURN THE FOOT OUT
I PICK MY LEFT FOOT UP BRING MY KNEE IN FRONT OF THE BODY LIFT THE FOOT UP BY MY HIP AND TURN MY HIP SIDEWAYS
YOU CAN USE THEM AS SORT OF AN INNER VISUAL TO FOCUS ENERGY FLOWS IN YOUR BODY
YOU HAVE SEVEN CHAKRAS OR ENERGETIC POINTS WITHIN THE BODY
ONCE THEY BECOME COMFORTABLE WITH THAT THEN YOU CAN KIND OF MOVE AWAY FROM THE BODY A LITTLE BIT PULL YOUR CHEST AWAY
AGAIN MAKE IT AS LONG OR ALMOST AS LONG AS THE BODY
START AT THE TOP OF YOUR FELT MAKE SURE YOUR FULL LEFT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO USE THAT FOLD FOR THE BODY LIKE WE DID FOR THE WINGS
YOU WANT YOUR WINGS TO BE ALMOST THE SAME SIZE AS THE WHOLE BODY OR EVEN A LITTLE BIT BIGGER
YOUR GOING TO WANT TO PULL YOUR BODY OF YOUR BUG ALONGSIDE
JUST TO SUMMARIZE REMEMBER THAT FEVER IS AN EARLY WARNING SIGN IN YOUR BODY THAT TELLS YOU THAT SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT AND THAT YOU SHOULD REALLY TAKE NOTICE OF IT
AND YOU KNOW SOME THINGS DON'T NECESSARILY FIT EACH INDIVIDUAL BODY TYPE
AS YOU NOLLIE TURN YOUR UPPER BODY TOWARDS THE FRONT FOOT SO THE REST OF THE BOARD WILL SPIN THE 180 DEGREES
UVB COMES FROM FLORESCENT FIXTURES EITHER A COMPACT OR THE GOOD OLD TUBE FIXTURE AND WHAT THAT DOES IS THE UVB GIVES THE ANIMAL UVB LIGHT WHICH HE NEEDS TO CREATE VITAMIN D THREE IN HIS BODY AND MOVE CALCIUM INTO THE BONE STRUCTURE
SO YOU PUT YOUR FOOT ON THE FLOOR WE ARE GOING TO SPIN AROUND THE RIGHT FOOT AND SO THE IDEA IS TO PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR FOOT AND THEN MOVE YOUR WEIGHT MOVE YOUR BODY WEIGHT YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY OVER THAT FOOT AND PUSH OFF WITH THE BACK FOOT
SO I WANT TO GO THROUGH A FEW STRETCHES ON YOUR UPPER BODY
ALWAYS HAVE HAIR SPRAY FOR THE RED CARPET BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN A HAIR FLIES OUT JUST VERY LIGHTLY AND TO GIVE IT SOME BODY
AND THEN MAKING SURE THAT THE BUTTERFLY IS FLAT AND THE BODY IS FLAT AND IT HOPEFULLY COMES RIGHT TO THE EDGE OF THE CONSTRUCTION PAPER WE'RE GOING TO BRING THE STAPLER IN AGAIN AND GO IN AT AN ANGLE AND ATTACH IT THERE
SO I KEEP MAKING SURE THAT I CAN PICK IT UP IT'S DRYING AS WE WORK THROUGH THE REST OF THE PROJECT AND WE'RE JUST ABOUT READY TO ATTACH THE PIPE CLEANER BODY
THERE ARE SOME OTHER THINGS YOU COULD MAKE THE BODY OUT OF
WHAT WE'LL DO NOW IS BRING IT IN AND WE WANT TO CATCH IT RIGHT HERE BETWEEN THE HEAD AND THE BODY WITH A STAPLE
YOU DON'T WANT TO TRY TO GUESS ON EACH FENDER WHERE THE HIGH POINT IS OR WHERE A PARTICULAR BODY LINE IS YOU JUST WANT TO MEASURE A STRAIGHT LINE THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE WHEEL AND HE'S GOING TO RECORD THAT ON A PIECE OF PAPER FOR EACH CORNER AND SEE HOW THEY COMPARE
THE HANDS CIRCLE DOWNWARD RELAXING AND THEY BOTH HIT TO THE SIDE OF YOUR THIGH OUT TO THE SIDE OF THE BODY ALL THE WAY UP
KEEP YOUR BODY IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION SHOULDERS BACK HEAD UP BACK NICE AND STRAIGHT
YOU CAN FEEL FIND BODIES OF WATER THAT ARE MOVING CREAKS RIVERS MOST OF THE TIME THEY LEAD TO A BIGGER BODY OF WATER
I'M GOING TO CRADLE MY RIGHT ELBOW THROUGH MY BODY AND I'M GOING TO PULL THIS ARM BACK TOWARD MY SHOULDER
SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE PAINTING IT WE'RE GOING TO USE- FOR OUR WINDMILL WE'LL GIVE IT A NICE PURPLE COLOR AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REAL NEED TO DECORATE IT IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT COLORS OR ANY WILD WAY BUT YOU WANT TO USE A COLOR SCHEME THAT IT SHOULD FIT IN WITH THE REGULAR BODY OF THE MILK CARTON WHICH IS GOING TO BE THE BODY OF THE WINDMILL
ALRIGHT WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER OUTSIDE OF THE BODY SELF DEFENSE TECHNIQUES
THE REASON WE'RE SAYING OUTSIDE OF THE BODY WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT A SPECIFIC STRIKE
WE'RE INCORPORATING THE OBLIQUE S THE WHOLE ABDOMINAL REGION THE GLUTES YOUR UPPER BODY -SO EVERYTHING IS INCLUDED IN THIS EXERCISE
LOWERING THE BODY AGAIN DOWN THROUGH A FULL RANGE OF MOTION AS COMFORTABLE
UPPER BODY STRENGTHENING STARTS WITH UPPER BODY AWARENESS AND IN THIS SERIES WE'RE GOING TO START HERE IN OUR EASY POSE
I CAN MOVE THAT TO THE BODY OF THE CYMBAL OR YOU CAN KEEP IT ON THE BELL
GO AHEAD AND LET THE BODY COME DOWN AND YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL THIS IMMEDIATELY THROUGH THE HAMSTRINGS AND ESPECIALLY IN THE CALVES AND BEHIND THE BACKS OF THE KNEES
WHAT YOU WILL DO IS TURN SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR THUMB TO THE SIDE MID LINE OF THE BODY JUST LIKE IF YOU WERE HOLDING ON TO A GOLF CLUB
BRINGING THE ELBOWS SLIGHTLY IN FRONT OF THE BODY SO OUR FOCUS IS GOING TO BE MORE FOREARM
HAMMER CURLS ARE THE SISTER TO THE BICEP CURL WHERE WE WOULD HAVE EVERYTHING LINED UP SUPPINE TO YOUR BODY
INHALE INTO THAT CHAKRA AND EXHALE PUSHING THE LIGHT OUT BEYOND YOUR BODY BEYOND THE CONFINES OF THE ROOM
SO WITH THAT BEING SAID STAY TUNED AND I'LL SHOW YOU ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXERCISES THAT ARE GOING TO STRENGTHEN YOUR ENTIRE BODY AND SUPPORT THE MUSCLES AROUND YOUR KNEE
NOW YOU HAVE THE BODY OF YOUR LADYBUG
YOUR BODY SHOULD BE STRAIGHT OKAY YOUR TORSO IS UP YOU'RE TUCKED IN FOLLOWERS AND LEADERS
WE TURN OUR BODY SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT AND BRING OUR RIGHT HAND FORWARD AND WE THROW THE LEFT LEAD HOOK ONE THEN WE COME FORWARD LEFT HAND COMES TO MY FACE AND MY RIGHT HAND THROWS THE UPPER CUT TWO NOW FROM HERE MY LOAD UP I AM GOING TO TWIST BACK THIS WAY AND MY WEIGHT GOES TO MY RIGHT FOOT AND MY RIGHT SHOULDER PULLS MY LEFT HAND FORWARD AND I STEP IN LEAD HOOK REAR UPPER CUT
SO WE START FROM HERE MY LEFT HAND IS UP MY ELBOWS ARE DOWN INTO MY BODY
SHE IS GOING TO THROW HER LEAD HOOK ONE THEN SHE IS GOING TO TWIST HER BODY UP UPPER CUT TWO
MELISSA IS HERE AND NOW SHE IS GOING TO LOAD THE BODY THIS WAY AND SHE IS GOING TO BRING THIS HAND FORWARD AND TWIST
I'M GOING TO TAKE MY LEGS I'M GOING TO TAKE THEM AND EXTEND THEM OUT I'M GOING TO LOWER MY BODY INTO THIS NOW WATCH WHAT I JUST DID
SO WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE IS YOU'RE BRINGING ALL THE WEIGHT OF YOUR BODY AND YOU'RE CARRYING IT UP AND DOWN
SO THERE'S GOING TO BE THIS PRESSURE AND DISCOMFORT HERE IN THIS AREA IN ORDER TO AND AS I WORK THIS AREA IT WILL HELP TO ACTUALLY BALANCE OUT THE ADRENALS IN HER BODY
HOW THOSE AFFECTS ARE ACTUALLY TAKING PLACE IN THE BODY
MAINTAINING YOUR BALANCE AND RELAX TO WHERE THE BODY IS NICE AND FLAT ACROSS YOUR BALANCE TRAINER
AGAIN THIS IS JUST REALLY WORKING ON YOUR AEROBIC THRESHOLDS AND KIND OF PUSHING THOSE LIMITS TO HELP YOUR BODY MAXIMIZE IT'S USE OF THE OXYGEN YOU ARE TAKING IN WITH EVERY BREATH
YOUR FOCUS HAS GOT TO BE ON THE FRONT PART OF THE ARM AND NOT SWAYING BACK AND FORTH WITH THE WHOLE BODY
WATCH CAREFULLY AS THE GIRLS DEMONSTRATE PARRY FOUR VERY SMOOTHLY ACROSS THE BODY LIKE SO
IT HYDRATES YOUR BODY
NOW WHAT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU DO PUSH HANDS IS TO NOT COLLAPSE YOUR BODY
WHETHER IT IS COMPROMISED OF OR COMPRISED OF A DIFFERENT SORTS OF STROKES WHETHER YOU ARE USING ONE TYPE OF STROKE OVER THE ENTIRE BODY OF YOUR HORSE BUT IT IS FOCUSED DELIBERATE TOUCH THAT IS DONE FOR EITHER THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES OR FOR RELAXATION OR TO HELP THE HORSE RECOVER FROM AN ILLNESS OR AN INJURY
AND AS YOU GET BETTER AND BETTER AT IT-OKAY MAKE SURE YOU CAN START MOVING YOUR BODY IN A WAY GOING WITH YOUR NUNCHUCKS BECAUSE AS AGAIN YOU DON'T WANT TO STAY STILL AND BEAT UP YOUR BODY
IT IS BETTER IF YOU CAN TO SLEEP ON YOUR BACK OR FLAT OUT LIKE THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS OR COMPRESSION ON ANY PARTS OF YOUR BODY
ALSO IT WOULD BE GOOD BESIDES DOING THE CONSTANT CHANGING AROUND OF YOUR BODY IS TO GET A PILLOW LIKE WHAT I HAVE HERE IS A KIND OF CYLINDRICAL ROUND PILLOW AND IT IS GOOD TO PUT THIS UNDER YOUR LEGS AND THAT SORT OF HELPS TO ALLEVIATE THE CREEPY CRAWLY SENSATIONS IN YOUR LEGS
NOW MOST OF THE TIME WE ALWAYS HAVE A FAVORITE WAY TO SLEEP IN BED AND WHAT WE DO IS WE TEND TO LIE ON OUR SIDES FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND WE SCRUNCH UP OUR BODY AND WHEN YOU DO THIS YOU TEND TO COMPRESS THE LOWER ABDOMINAL AREA AND ALSO RESTRICT THE BLOOD FLOW TO THE LOWER EXTREMITIES OR THE LOWER LEGS AND THAT WOULD INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING THE RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME SO IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT WHILE YOU ARE SLEEPING A LOT OF TIMES IT IS GOOD TO CHANGE POSITIONS CONSTANTLY SO THAT YOU DON'T RESTRICT BLOOD FLOW TO YOUR LEGS AND ALSO TO CAUSE A LOT OF CONSTRICTION OF MUSCLES AROUND THIS AREA
EACH HARNESS IS MADE DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF CLIMBING THAT YOU'RE DOING AND YOUR BODY STYLE
AND HIS BODY IS GOING IN THAT DIRECTION AS WELL
YOUR BODY CANNOT TELL A LIE OR HEAR A LIE AND STAY STRONG AND THATS JUST A PHYSIOLOGICAL FACT
SHIATSU ORIGINATING FROM JAPAN HAS BEEN USED FOR CENTURIES TO TREAT THE ENERGY SYSTEM OF THE BODY FOR HEALTH AND WELLNESS
TOTAL BODY WE USE
TECHNIQUE IS HOW YOU ARE ACTUALLY USING YOUR HANDS YOUR BODY AND YOUR WRIST AND ALL OF THAT RIGHT
CHAIR POSE IT'S A WAY TO START USING THE LOWER BODY AND JUST LIKE IN ANY MOVEMENT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO YOU'RE GOING TO BE ACTIVATING THAT CENTER OF GRAVITY OR YOUR CORE STRENGTH
SO JUST LIKE YOU'RE SITTING IN A CHAIR KNEE IN LINE WITH THE ANKLE BEHIND THE TOES AT ALL TIMES JUST LIKE IN ANY LOWER BODY MOVEMENT
SO THAT'S FIRST AND AFTER YOU'VE WORKED FROM HEAD NECK TO SHOULDERS YOU'RE READY TO START INCORPORATING SOME OF THAT LOWER BODY ON THE OTHER HALF OF THAT CENTER OF GRAVITY
YOU CAN DO ABOUT TEN TO TWELVE MAYBE FIFTEEN REPS AND THAT SHOULD GET THE LOWER BODY INCORPORATED INTO YOUR WARM-UP FUNCTIONALLY
THE REST OF THE CLEANING GOBY IS BLACK OVER MOST OF ITS BODY ALTHOUGH THE BELLY IS LIGHT COLORED WHITE OR WHITISH BLUE
GETTING SOME BREATH IN THE BODY
OVERALL TYPICALLY THE RESPONSE OF TONING THIGHS IS TO GIVE THEM MORE MUSCULAR APPEARANCE REMOVING THE BODY FAT
THE FIRST THING I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS IS SPECIFICALLY ISOLATING ASPECTS OR ANGLES OF THE MUSCLE ESPECIALLY THE LOWER BODY
THE MUSCLE OF THE INNER THIGHS ARE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING THE LEG INTO THE MIDLINE OF THE BODY OR ADDUCTION THINK OF ADDING TO THE INSIDE
LOWER THE BODY TO WHERE THE BACK IS SUPPORTED
BRING THE KNEE IN AND RELAX DOWN TO WHERE YOUR BODY IS LEVEL
SO YOU MIGHT HAVE TO SIT NEXT TO THEM ON THEIR BED YOU MIGHT HAVE TO KNEEL NEXT TO THEM YOU MIGHT BE ON THE FLOOR NEXT TO THE INDIVIDUAL WORKING ON THEM AND JUST KNOW THAT FOR WHATEVER AMOUNT OF TIME YOU HAVE TO BE CONSCIENTIOUS OF YOUR OWN BODY
SO EVEN IF WE CAN'T PRONOUNCE IT WE CAN CERTAINLY LEARN HOW TO WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THE RULE IS IS THAT IF YOU CAN'T PRONOUNCE IT YOU SHOULDN'T BE HAVING IT IN YOUR BODY
BUT GUESS WHAT IN THE OLD MANUSCRIPTS YOU KNOW NO BODY WAS SITTING AT A COMPUTER BACK IN THE 1200'S OR THE 113 A.D NO ONE WAS SITTING AT A COMPUTER
THIS COMBINATION IS ACTUALLY MORE RECOMMENDED BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE GOING TO DECREASE YOUR LONG EXPOSURE OF ESTROGEN OR HIGHER EXPOSURE TO ESTROGEN IN THE BODY OR UNOPPOSED ESTROGEN BECAUSE UNOPPOSED ESTROGEN PUTS YOU AT HIGHER RISK TO DEVELOPING CERTAIN CANCERS LIKE ENDOMETRIAL CANCER
THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS JUST RELAX YOUR BODY
AND ALSO SIMPLE THINGS LIKE GETTING A STRETCHY BAND THAT ALSO IS GOOD BECAUSE YOU CAN BESIDES BEING GOOD FOR YOUR GIVING YOUR BODY TONE YOU CAN DO STRETCHY EXERCISES WITH THESE VERY SIMPLE
I MEAN EVEN UP IN HERE WE HAVE A PILATES A PILATES MAT OR A YOGA MAT AND ANYTHING THAT AT LEAST GIVES YOU SOME INSTALLATION AGAINST HARD FLOOR AND YOU COULD DO LIKE SIMPLES EXERCISES JUST TO INCREASE THE FLOW AND CIRCULATION FOR YOUR BODY AND THAT WOULD ELIMINATE THE SENSE OF FATIGUE OR APATHY OR LETHARGY BECAUSE YOU ARE INCREASING OXYGEN FLOW ESPECIALLY TO YOUR HEAD AND TO YOUR WHOLE BODY
WHAT I DO IS I TAKE IT I SPIN IT AROUND TO WHERE MY ARMS ARE CROSSED BUT THEN I LAY IT UP AGAINST MY BODY TO THE SIDE AND THAT'S ACTUALLY A STRIKE IN OF ITSELF BUT THEN YOU CAN TURN THAT INTO A SPIN BY TAKING IT UNCROSSING YOUR ARMS CHANGING YOUR HANDS POSITIONS SO NOW YOUR RIGHT HAND IS PALM DOWN LEFT HAND PALM UP
CROSS IT AROUND AND LAY IT UP AGAINST YOUR BODY AND WHAT YOU DO IS YOU SCOOP DOWN CHANGE YOUR HANDS AND NOW YOU SCOOP DOWN TO THE OTHER SIDE AND IT'S ACTUALLY A CONTINUOUS SPINNING OF THE BO STAFF
SO WE DRAW THE SHELLS THERE IN THE BACK OF HIS BEETLE BODY AND THAT WILL PRETTY MUCH DO IT AS FAR AS THE BODY IS CONCERNED
GET A LITTLE BIT OF SPEED AND STOMP ON THE NOSE AND AS YOU STOMP SPIN YOUR BODY IN THE DIRECTION THAT YOU WANT TO TURN AND ON THIS THE NOLLIE FRONTSIDE 180 IS THE SPIN WHERE YOU CAN SEE WHERE YOU ARE TURNING THUS MAKING IT THE EASIER OF THE TWO BUT WHEN YOU INCORPORATE THE PUSHING AND RIDING AROUND AND ALL THE OTHER PARTS OF THE NOLLIE 180 AND YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS
SO YOU'RE GOING TO WORK YOUR UPPER BODY MUSCLES AT DIFFERENT ANGLES AND BENEFIT INCREASING YOUR UPPER BODY STRENGTH
WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOUR TRYING TO FIGURE OUT FOR YOURSELF YOU CAN FIND OUT BY MUSCLE TESTING AND USING YOUR BODY AS A LIE DETECTOR
I WANT TO GET MY BODY MY BELT BEHIND HIS BELT
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO STRETCH BEFORE YOU DO THIS STUFF EVEN THOUGH IT IS MORE UPPER BODY YOU CAN STILL THROW SOME THINGS OUT OF WHACK
NOW WITH THESE GOOD CLOTHING YOU MAY ALSO WANT TO ADD IN SOME PETROLEUM JELLY ON THOSE RUB POINTS BUT THE COMBINATION OF THOSE APPROPRIATE CLOTHING NOT ONLY FOR YOUR BODY STYLE BUT THE APPROPRIATE CLOTHING FOR YOUR SPORTING EVENT AND USING SOME SORT OF LAYER SUCH AS PETROLEUM JELLY OR BODY GLIDE WILL HELP PREVENT CHAFING IN YOUR NEXT EVENT
KEEP YOUR FEET IN A NICE GENERAL POSITION AND USE YOUR UPPER BODY TO ADJUST AND HOLD THE MANUAL FOR THE WHOLE DISTANCE OF THE TOP OF THE PAD
THEN WE HAVE THE BODY WHICH IS JUST A ROUND CIRCLE AND A LINING WHICH IS THE EXACT DUPLICATE OF THIS
THIS IS GOING TO HELP TO DEVELOP STABILITY FOR YOUR CORE AND ALSO YOUR LOWER BODY WHICH WILL THEN TRANSLATE INTO WHAT YOU CAN DO ON THE FIELD WHILE WORKING WITH YOUR ARMS
I'M GOING TO STEP IN I'M GOING TO STRIKE DOWN TO THE NOSE STRAIGHT IN DROP MY BODY WEIGHT
WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL PUT THE EDGE OF THE BLOCK ON THE FLOOR AND WE'LL USE OUR BODY WEIGHT AND LAY ON THE BLOCK SUPPORTING YOURSELF WITH YOUR ARMS
YOU'LL JUST WANT TO BREATHE INTO THE BLOCK AND TAKE YOUR TIME TO RELAX INTO THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY LAYING OVER THE BLOCK
ONE OF THE CHECKS YOU WANT TO DO WITH THIS IS LAY YOUR TOOL AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE BODY AND WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
WHAT I'LL ALSO DO AT THIS POINT BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT SAW MARKS AND OTHER MARKS FROM THE PARTING TOOL I'LL SQUARE UP THE TOP END OF THE BODY
DURING THIS SESSION WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE BODY THAT WE HAVE JUST SEPARATED AND MOUNT IT ON THE LATHE
YOU CAN ALSO DO A COUPLE MOVEMENTS HERE I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND ANY CHEST MOVEMENTS AGAIN BECAUSE YOU'RE BLOCKING YOUR BODY
IF YOUR FORM IS SLOPPY AND YOUR BIOMECHANICS ARE BAD YOUR BODY IS NOT GOING TO RESPOND THE WAY YOU WANT IT TO SO THOSE THREE THINGS AGAIN WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN AND ADHERE TO A SCHEDULE THAT IS GOING TO WORK FOR US AND WE CAN BENEFIT FROM SO CONSISTENCY BEING A BIG ONE
BESIDES THAT YOU NEED TO WARM UP YOUR BODY TENNIS IS A VERY HIGH IMPACT SPORT TO THE POINT THAT IT'S HARD ON YOUR KNEES HARD ON YOUR ELBOWS
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE PLAYING A MATCH TRY TO COME TO THE TENNIS COURT AND WARM UP THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE AT LEAST FIFTEEN MINUTES SO YOU HAVE GOOD TEN MINUTES TO WARM UP YOUR BODY BEFORE YOU START WITH A MATCH
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THINK OF YOUR BODY AS BEING ON A SEE SAW OR A TEETER TOTTER
SO WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL START BY DRAWING SORT OF THE OUTLINE OF HIS HEAD AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO ACTUALLY IS I'M GOING TO KIND OF GIVE THIS GUY THE BODY OF A RHINOCEROS BECAUSE IN MY MIND THE BEETLES ARE KIND OF THE RHINOS OF THE LITTLE BUG COMMUNITY
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT IS BUT JEEZ ANY BODY CAN DO IT
AND THIS TACTIC GETS ITS STRENGTH NOT FROM THE HAND PUNCHING OUT BUT FROM THE WEDGING OF THE BODY FOLLOWING UP
I'VE EXPERIENCED BENEFITS OF MY OWN BODY OF INCREASE STRENGTH INCREASE POSTURE INCREASE AWARENESS OF HOW MY BODY MOVES AND ITS ABILITIES
YOU'LL FIND THAT YOUR BODY WILL ACTUALLY CHANGE SHAPE
EXTREMITIES ALWAYS GO TOWARDS THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM TOWARDS THE CENTER OF THE BODY TOWARDS THE HEART
STILL MAINTAINING THIS BODY CONNECTION CHEST TO CHEST ALL THE TIME
MY CENTER DROPS TO CUT HIS BODY OUT FROM UNDERNEATH HIM
THEY ALSO FREQUENTLY HAVE RETICULATED MARKINGS OVER THEIR BODY BUT THOSE MARKING MAY NOT ALWAYS BE OBVIOUS
SLENDER FILEFISH ARE GENERALLY A SHADE OF BROWN EITHER A REDDISH OR A YELLOWISH BROWN TO GRAY ON THE TOP PART OF THEIR BODY AND THEN A LIGHTER COLOR ON THE BOTTOM HALF
IT'S ALSO GOOD TO KEEP YOUR OIL CLOSE TO YOU SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DISCONNECT FROM THE BODY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
IT'S JUST ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS OF THE BODY BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY MUSCLES
SO ACTUALLY WHEN YOU EAT SUGAR YOUR BODY SECRETES INSULIN AND WHEN YOUR BODY SECRETES INSULIN IT ALSO CHANGES YOUR ESTROGEN BALANCE ACTUALLY RAISES IT AND MAKES YOU MORE PRONE TO BREAST CANCER AND OTHER HORMONAL CANCERS
SHE'S GOING TO BRING HER RIGHT HAND CROSSING THE LOWER BODY THIS WAY
FOR STRONG VERY STRONG BODY TECHNIQUES BOTH HANDS WOULD COME TOGETHER
AND YOU WANT TO HOLD THOSE STRETCHES FOR AT LEAST THIRTY SECONDS SO THAT IT GIVES YOUR TIE YOUR BODY TIME TO REALLY LENGTHEN
USUALLY WE TAKE AN OUTLINE OF WHERE WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT ON YOUR BODY AND THEN USE THAT AND THROW SOME GUIDELINES TO MUSCLE MOVEMENT AND THEN WE APPLY THE PAPER SOMETIMES
WE CAN GET THE ACTUAL FLOW OF THE BODY ITSELF
ON THE INSIDE OF MY BAG I HAVE A PIECE OF THIS RUBBER STUFF THAT KEEPS THE BAG FROM SLIPPING WHEN IT'S AGAINST YOUR BODY
WHEN YOU PULL FORWARD YOU TURN YOUR BODY AND AS SOON AS YOUR SHOULDER GETS PAST YOUR OTHER SHOULDER YOUR ELBOW IS GOING TO ACTUALLY KINK
NOW IN YOUR MIND I WANT YOU AND WITH YOUR BODY TO PAUSE AT TWELVE O'CLOCK AND SIX O'CLOCK SO DRAW YOUR CIRCLE UP TO TWELVE O'CLOCK DOWN TO SIX O'CLOCK
HE KEEPS HIS HEAD BACK AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO US USE THE CURRENT OF MY BODY TO HELP PULL HIM ACROSS THE POOL AND HE'LL BE FLOATING BY HIMSELF
THIS GIVES US THE ATTACHED BODY ON TO THE WINGS
NOW IF YOU DON'T CARRY PERFUME ON YOU WHICH I RECOMMEND TO CARRY A LITTLE TUBE IN YOUR PURSE YOU CAN ALWAYS CARRY A LITTLE BODY SPLASH BECAUSE IT'S A VERY NATURAL SCENT
SO WHEN YOU'RE GOING INTO A MEETING OR YOU'RE GOING INTO YOUR OFFICE YOU CAN ALWAYS SPRITZ YOURSELF REALLY QUICKLY WITH A BODY SPRAY
SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE CREAMS AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE PERFUME GET THE BODY SPLASH
HARMONIE KRIEGER SO LIKE I WAS TALKING ABOUT WITH THE BATH & BODY WORKS AND THE BODY CREAM AND THE LOTION THIS IS THE BODY SPRAY
BUT IT'S GOT A DIFFERENT COLORATION TO IT AND IT'S GOT THAT STICKY PLASTIC KIND OF FEEL THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR OUT OF A CLAY BODY SO
WELL WE NEED FATS FOR HORMONE PRODUCTION IN THE BODY FATS CUSHION THE ORGANS THE BRAIN IS SIXTY PERCENT FAT IT'S PRIMARILY THE OMEGA-3 FATS SO WE NEED IT FOR GOOD HEART HEALTH
YOU RE ACTUALLY GOING TO POP THE YO-YO OUT OF THE STRING ON THE INSIDE IT'S THE SIDE CLOSEST TO YOUR BODY
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAY WE PERCEIVE PAIN IN THE BODY
NOW IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS TECHNIQUE WORKS YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ANATOMY OF THE BODY
THE HANDS AND ARMS EVEN IF YOU'RE A BODY BUILDER THEY'RE RELATIVELY WEAK COMPARED TO THE TORSO AND THE LEGS
YOU SEE HOW THE BODY TURNS JUST TO THROW A BALL
WHETHER YOU PLAY TENNIS YOU HAVE TO TURN THE BODY
SO TURNING IS REALLY A KEY SKILL SO YOU WANT TO GET A GOOD HIP SHOULDER TURN BECAUSE THESE ARE THE BIG STRONG MUSCLES OF THE BODY NOT THE HANDS AND ARMS
OKAY TURNING THE BODY WHICH MEANS THIS
THAT'S CALLED A BODY TURN SO NOW I'VE GOT MY BODY COILED AND WHEN I UNCOIL IT GENERATES A LOT OF POWER TO HIT THE GOLF BALL
SO SET UP IN THE REGULAR NOLLIE POSITION AND YOU'RE GOING TO TURN YOUR BODY AND HEAD IN THE BLINDSIDE POSITION OR BLINDSIDE DIRECTION
SO YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO REMEMBER YOUR UPPER BODY AND SWING YOUR ARMS AND HEADING IN THE BACKSIDE DIRECTION
I HAVE A MENS WEAR INSPIRED BOXER BRIEF BOY SHORT BOTTOM AND THEN A TUBE TOP WITH SOME STRAPS GIVING IT MORE FLARE AS OPPOSED TO JUST THE TUBE TOP STRAIGHT ACROSS SO THAT WAY IT KIND OF MIXES THE SEXY AND SPORTY AND AGAIN ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS TO DO IS TO USE THE BODY TO DRAW MY DESIGNS ON THE ACTUAL WHATEVER IT IS I'M DESIGNING LIKE THE LINES ON THE BATHING SUIT CURVE WHERE HER HIPS CURVE IT JUST TENDS TO GIVE IT MORE MOVEMENT MORE ELEGANCE AND THIS IS WHERE WE WILL DRAW IT WHICH IS PRETTY SELF EXPLANATORY TUBE TOP STRAPS AND THEN DIP LOW IN THE FRONT KEEPING IT LOW CUT LIKE A BOXER BRIEF AND THERE YOU GO
SO AS I CURL THE WEIGHT UP I'M KEEPING MY ELBOWS LOCKED TO THE SIDES OF MY BODY
YU WANT TO HAVE SOME THAT ARE GOOD FOR HIS FACE SOME THAT ARE GOOD FOR HIS BODY SO THAT WAY YOU ARE READY FOR EVER YOU WANT TO DO
HI I'M DR GARRETT SMITH FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL EXERCISES FOR THE LOWER BODY THE AIR SQUAT'
SOME PEOPLE KNOW IT AS THE BODY WEIGHT SQUAT BECAUSE IT'S JUST YOUR BODY WEIGHT
IF WE PRESS IT DOWN IT GIVES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE ROUNDED AFFECT ON THE TOP AND A FLATTER INSIDE WHICH WILL GO AGAINST THE UNDER BODY AND ALSO KEEP THE LIMBS HEAD AND TAIL ALL IN PLACE
SO THE PARTS ON THIS GUITAR THAT WE CAN TAKE OFF ARE THE BRIDGE THE STRINGS THE STRING HOLDER WHICH ALL FULL BODY ACOUSTIC GUITARS THAT ARE ELECTRIC HAVE A STRING HOLDER ON THEM
SO IT'S IT HAS ENOUGH ROOM IN IT SO THAT IT CAN BREATHE AND LET THE MATTRESS BREATHE UNDERNEATH IT BUT THEN AGAIN IT DOESN'T LET WATER THROUGH OR ANY LIQUID OR DUST MITES SO THIS OR EITHER YOUR BODY SWEAT OR ANY THING LIKE THAT
IT WILL GET YOUR ARM MOVING LOOSENS UP THE WHOLE UPPER BODY RIGHT HERE AND YOU SHOULD DO BOTH HANDS EVEN THOUGH WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE USING ONE TODAY
YOU KNOW YOUR OWN BODY AND YOU CAN DECIDE FOR YOURSELF WHAT A GOOD PORTION IS AND FOR THE MOST PART IT IS A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN THE RESTAURANTS AND THE COOK BOOKS SAY THAT IT IS
AND THIS PROTEIN HERE YOUR BODY KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH
MAKE SURE YOU DO THAT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T LOOK AS GOOD IF YOUR BODY IS NICE AND LOOSE AND USE YOUR HANDS TO STAND UP
ONE MORE TIME I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THE CORRECT BODY POSITION AND TECHNIQUE FOR A FORWARD ROLL
BABIES CAN'T REGULATE THEIR BODY TEMPERATURE AS WELL AS ADULTS SO THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND THEIR SKIN IS ULTRA SENSITIVE TO HEAT
SO WE'VE GOT OUR UPPER BODY AND OUR ARMS
THE TRICK TO DO THAT IS TO THINK ABOUT TAKING YOUR BELLY BUTTON AND TRYING TO SUCK IT THROUGH YOUR BODY TO YOUR BACK
THERE SHOULD BE NO VISIBLE ARCH IN YOUR BODY OKAY WHAT I AM DOING RIGHT NOW IS ARCHING THERE SHOULD BE NO VISIBLE ARCH IN YOUR BODY WHEN YOU ARE ENTERING THE WATER
WHAT DO YOU DO TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A GOOD BODY LINE
SO IN THESE POSTURES WE'RE GOING TO WORK A LOT WITH SUPPORTING OUR OWN BODY WEIGHT
SO WE JUST FINISHED OUR BANGING ON THE DRUMS WE'RE GOING TO ADD TO IT OUR HEEL POPS AND DROPS WITH A BODY ROLL DOING IT FAST OKAY
NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT EXCESS GAS COMES FROM EATING CERTAIN FOODS THAT DON'T REACT WELL WITH THEIR BODY AND ACTUALLY THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE HOWEVER THE KEY THAT I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE MISSING IS THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW MUCH GOOD BACTERIA AND HA WE HAVE IN OUR INTESTINES AND HAVING THE RIGHT BALANCE
AND YOU CAN ANGLE YOUR BODY SLIGHTLY SO YOU'RE GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE HAND THAT'S COMING DOWN AROUND YOUR FACE
SO PRACTICE THIS IN THE MIRROR AND SEE WHAT YOUR HANDS LOOK LIKE AS THEY'RE FRAMING YOUR FACE AND COMING OUT FROM YOUR BODY
BASICALLY VENEERS IS ANOTHER FORM OF A CROWN BUT IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BECAUSE A CROWN COVERS THE FULL BODY OF THE TOOTH
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK FOR THE COMFORT OF YOUR BODY SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO RELEASE YOUR HIPS TOWARDS THE EARTH CREATING BALANCE IN BOTH FEET
MOVING THROUGH THE BODY OPENING THE HEART PRESSING DOWN INTO THE BRIGHT YELLOW THE NICE ORANGE AND BEAUTIFUL ROSE RED
AND THAT'S THE LOWER BODY MECHANICS OF APPROACHING A HEEL SIDE FIVE ZERO ON A HANDRAIL
THIS STUFF IS REALLY FUN FOR KIDS BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE YOUR BODY IS DOING SOMETHING THAT YOUR BODY IS NOT REALLY DOING
AGAIN CONTROL BY HOLDING HIS ARM DROPPING YOUR KNEES ONTO HIS BODY SO YOU CAN FINISH OFF WITH A GOOD STRIKE AND LEAVE HIM ON THE GROUND WAITING FOR HELP
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY PERSON TO TEACH THE WHOLE BODY OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE TO ANOTHER PERSON
SO WHERE DO WE PUT OUR MIND IN THE BODY AS WE'RE DOING THESE MOVEMENT
BUT IF YOU FOLLOW THE LINES OF THE BODY AGAIN TOTALLY EASY TO DRAW AND THEN THE TOP USE YOUR IMAGINATION I HAVE IT AS JUST A TIED TRIANGLE TOP SO IT CAN BE ANYTHING YOU CAN HAVE IT BE JUST STRAIGHT ACROSS CLASPING LIKE A BRA TOP THERE
SO JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU KEEP YOUR ELBOWS CLOSE TO YOUR BODY AND YOU CONTACT THE BALL AT THIS POINT IN FRONT OF YOU
AGAIN NORMALLY HAPPENS ON THE BACKHAND SIDE BECAUSE WE ARE MOVING OUR BODY FORWARD AND WHEN WE'RE AIMING THE BALL AS YOU CAN SEE MY FACE OF THE RACQUET IS LOOKING OVER THERE INSTEAD OF LOOKING IN FRONT OF ME AND IT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE MY WRIST IS GIVING UP MY LEFT WRIST IS GIVING UP OR MY BODIES GOING FORWARD
GOOD SO YOU'RE GOING TO RELAX THE LEGS ALL THE WAY HERE SO THE HIPS ARE TURNED OFF AND WE'RE NOT USING OUR HIPS WE'RE USING JUST THE UPPER BODY
YOU WANT TO START SLOW WARMING UP YOUR BODY WARMING EVERYTHING UP TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T RUN INTO ANY INJURIES
WE NEVER WANT OUR HANDS TO BE BLOCKING OUR OUR WHAT ARE BODY IS DOING
NOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHEN WE BELLY DANCE WE OFTEN WANT OUR HANDS AWAY FROM OUR BODY OPENING TO THE SPACE LETTING OUR AUDIENCE SEE OUR MOVES
NOW IT'S IMPORTANT HERE NOT TO CLOSE IN DON'T CLOSE THE BODY IN KEEP THE ELBOWS LIFTED DON'T LET THE SHOULDERS COME UP KEEP THE SHOULDER BLADES DOWN
BUT IN THIS POSITION WE ACTUALLY DO BRING THE HANDS IN FRONT OF THE BODY
THEN ENJOY YOUR BREATH SO YOU APPRECIATE YOUR BODY AND YOU APPRECIATE THIS GREAT BREATH THAT ALLOWS YOU TO FEEL AND EXPERIENCE THIS OPENING INSIDE OF YOUR BODY
BONES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE IN THEIR BODY
ABOUT TWO MINUTES NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES THEY'LL VOMIT THAT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE IN THEIR BODY OUT
THE FIRST THING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS LEARN HOW TO FLOAT ON YOUR BACK BY SIMPLY PLACING YOUR HEAD BACK YOUR CHIN UP IN THE AIR PUTTING YOUR BELLY BUTTON UP AND JUST LETTING YOUR BODY FLOAT NATURALLY
KEEP THE ELBOWS TIGHT INTO YOUR BODY AS YOU PULL BACK AND ROW YOUR SHOULDERS ONTO YOUR BACK EACH TIME YOU CAN COMPLETE A REPETITION
AGAIN THIS EXERCISE DEVELOPS POWER EXPLOSIVENESS IN OUR LOWER BODY OUR THIGHS OUR GLUTS AND OUR LOWER CALVES
SHE'S GOING TO TRY TO KEEP THIS LEG ACTIVE BUT SHE'S GOING TO USE THIS STRAP TO ASSIST HER AND SHE'S GOING TO USE AN INHALE TO ALERT THE BODY AND THEN ON THE EXHALE SHE'S GOING TO BRING THAT LEG OVER TO THE RIGHT
SO THEN HE'S SUPPORTING HIS OWN BODY
I'M GOING TO PLANT THE KAYAK PADDLE IN THE WATER AND THEN I WANT TO ROTATE MY ENTIRE BODY BACK LIKE THIS
I LIFT OUT AGAIN I PLANT FRONT BLADE IN THE WATER AND I M GOING TO ROTATE MY ENTIRE BODY BACK
SEE HOW I'M LOOKING BACK AT THAT PADDLE THE WHOLE TIME AND IT FORCES MY BODY TO ROTATE
MAYBE YOU'RE A BIG MAN AND YOUR THING IS JUST YOU'RE A BIG BODY UNDER THE RIM AND WHEN THEY PASS IT DOWN LOW YOU CAN DUNK
TO CALCULATE YOUR BODY MASS INDEX YOU WANT TO FIGURE OUT YOUR WEIGHT IN KILOGRAMS
SO ONCE YOU PUT ALL THAT TOGETHER YOU GOT LIKE THE SICKEST CABBAGE PATCH DANCE EVER SO CHECK OUT THIS COUPLE OF CLIPS RIGHT HERE THIS IS HOW YOU CAN BE ABLE TO MOVE YOU BODY
MAKE SURE YOU TURN YOUR BODY LEFT AND RIGHT MAKE SURE IT BENDS SO IN THESE COUPLE OF CLIPS RIGHT HERE YOU SEE HOW YOUR BODY BENDS LEFT AND RIGHT AND HOW YOU CAN BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITH A LITTLE FUNK A LITTLE TWIST
WELL IT COMES FROM A HIGHLY TOXIC SUBSTANCE PETROLEUM AND WHEN YOU INGEST IT INTO YOUR BODY EVEN IN TRACE AMOUNTS OBVIOUSLY TEN POUNDS IS A LOT BUT THAT'S THROUGH TRACE AMOUNTS
NOW IF YOU COULD GO OUT AND YARD SALES YOU CAN FIND WHAT WE CALL SOME DIAMONDS IN THE ROUGH AND THIS PARTICULAR CASE THIS IS A PERIOD PIECE THAT IS A WIDE BODY ROCKER AND THESE ARE REALLY HARD TO COME BY YOU DON'T SEE A WHOLE OF THESE OUT THERE THEY ARE VERY RARE
THE ELBOWS ARE IN TIGHT TO THE BODY THIS WAY AND AGAIN AS YOU MEET THE PUNCH YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTACT AND A LITTLE BIT OF TENSION PUSHING IN AND DOWNWARD
TO WORK THE UPPER CUT OKAY YOU WANT TO START WITH YOUR HANDS IN FRONT OF THE BODY AND AGAIN YOU'RE GOING TO PUSH THE HANDS DOWNWARD THIS WAY
THESE EXERCISES WHEN PERFORMED ON A CONSISTENT BASIS DEFINITELY GETS YOUR BODY FEELING STRONGER AND IT DEFINITELY DOESN'T PUT STRESS ON THE KNEE
THE BODY TENDS TO GET OUT OF PHYSICAL BALANCE SO THE DOG WILL STAND SLIGHTLY CROOKED PUTTING THE WEIGHT ON ONE LEG RATHER THAN THE OTHER
AS YOU GO THROUGH STEP FIVE WE BRING THE TIE ONCE AGAIN THROUGH THE KNOT AND THIS WOULD BE AGAIN THE FORMATION OF YOUR FULL WINDSOR KNOT AND AS THIS POINT YOU BEGINNING TO GET THE BODY AND WE CAN DRAW STRING YOU BRING IT UP AS SUCH
ALL RIGHT SO SUNRISE ARMS UP AND LET THEM FLOAT DOWN AND OUTLINE YOUR BODY NICE AND SOFT AND UP KEEP THAT SHIMMY GOING NICE AND POWERFUL
YOUR GOING TO HAVE TWO WINGS ONE FOR EACH SIDE OF THE BUG BODY
SO YOU GOT TO THINK IS ANY BODY GOING TO LIKE THIS SONG A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING TO DANCE TO THIS SONG
THERE IS A VARIETY OF EXERCISES THAT YOU CAN DO TO INCREASE MUSCULATURE AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO COMBINE THAT WITH YOUR EATING HABITS MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO LOWER YOUR BODY FAT PERCENTAGE SO THAT WHATEVER MUSCULATURE YOU DO GAIN ACTUALLY SHOES
OR BASICALLY YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KEEP THE SHOULDERS FROM COMING UP KEEP THAT LINE SHINING ON THE CROWN OF THE HEAD EXHALE INHALE DO A FEEL YOU'LL FEEL THEM ALL ACROSS NOT ONLY THE SHOULDERS BUT ACROSS YOUR BODY
SO YOU DO THE UP AND DOWN MORE OF A DOWNWARD MOTION JUST TO GET THAT ENERGY MOVING GET THE BODY MOVING
OBLIQUES DOING SIDE TO SIDE MAYBE WITH A WEIGHT OKAY OTHER CRUNCHES THAT WE CAN DO FOR OUR STOMACH AND FINALLY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT UPPER BODY
YOU CAN DO YOUR TRADITIONAL STRETCHING AFTER EVERY WORKOUT THAT YOU DO BUT IF YOU DO STRADISH TRADITIONAL STRETCHING YOU WANT TO REMEMBER THAT YOU'RE STRETCHING EVERY MAJOR MUSCLE IN YOUR BODY SO YOUR SHOULDERS YOUR BICEPS YOUR TRICEPS YOUR ABS YOUR BACK YOUR QUADS YOUR HAMSTRINGS
AND IF YOU NOTICE HE DOESN'T HAVE COME ON STONEY HE DOESN'T HAVE A BODY SLOPE LIKE A GERMAN SHEPHERD
OUR JACKETS ALWAYS CARRY THE BODY ARMOR IN THEM FOR YOUR PERSONAL SAFETY
NOW MOVING TO WARM UP THE SIDES OF THE BODY WE ARE AGAIN GOING TO COME BACK TO BACK EASY SEATED POSE SUKA SAMA GOOD
WHAT BETTER WAY TO BALANCE THE BODY MIND AND SPIRIT OR DANCE IF YOU WILL THEN THROUGH YOGA USING BREATH AND ASANA BRINGING YOU CLOSER TO PEACE CALM AND EQUANIMITY
AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR YOUR BODY BOTH YOUR HIPS EVEN WITH HOME PLATE AND FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE WITH THE HANDS
MOVIE STARS AREN'T TYPICALLY MADE IN THEIR FIRST TIME OUT OF THE GATE SO TO SPEAK BUT THEY ARE ELEVATED TO THE STATUS OF A HEAVENLY BODY AS IT WERE BY THE PEOPLE THAT ENJOY AND APPRECIATE MOVIE MOVIES IN GENERAL
IF YOU HAVE REALLY GOOD BODY POSITION ALREADY THE WET SUIT WON'T PICK UP A LOT OF TIME BUT MOST PEOPLE WILL SEE A THREE TO FIVE SECOND PER HUNDRED IMPROVEMENT
GOOD JOB THAT WERE OUR HEEL POPS WITH OUR BODY ROLL FAST
SO WE HAVE FIVE OUR ARMS ARE GOING TO PULL ON AND SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT AND THEY GO STRAIGHT DOWN YOUR BODY
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO POSITION YOUR BODY FRONT AND BACK A LITTLE BIT IN BETWEEN
SO I'VE CREATED A KNOB CONTROL AND A BODY CONTACT THAT I CAN TOUCH AND NOW I HAVE A WAY OF ACTUALLY PLAYING THIS ELECTRONIC MUSICAL INSTRUMENT
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IS MY BODY BECOMES A PART OF THE CIRCUIT OR I TOUCH THEM TOGETHER AND IT CHANGES THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THERE
TODAY MY ASSISTANT KENDRA AND I ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU THROUGH A FULL BODY WORKOUT EXPLAINING EACH MOVEMENT COMPLETE WITH PROPER TECHNIQUE FORM AND BREATHING
AND THEN FROM THERE YOU CAN HAVE THE BODY OF THE FLOWER COME UP AND THEN THE STEM COULD GO UP HERE LIKE THAT
EACH OF YOU PASS EACH OTHER AND JUST LOOK AT THE OTHER ONE BECAUSE IN THIS WAY YOU WILL SEE WHERE YOU SHOULD TURN LEFT OR RIGHT HOW YOU HOLD YOUR FEET YOUR HANDS AND YOUR PARTS OF THE BODY AND THEN THIS WAY IT IS VERY SAFE
SO BY DOING MOVEMENTS WITH OUR BREATHING AND OUR CONNECTION OF THE MIND BODY AND OUR SPIRIT WE CAN GAIN MUCH BETTER HEALTH BECAUSE AS WE KNOW IN TODAY'S SOCIETY A LOT OF US ARE UNDER A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STRESS
YOU ARE GOING TO USE YOUR ARMS AS A TOOL TO SLOWLY NOT SLOWLY BUT SLIGHTLY LOOSEN THEIR GRIP GIVING YOU JUST ENOUGH OPPORTUNITY TO ESCAPE SO AS YOU DO THIS THEY ARE GOING TO GRAB YOU FROM BEHIND AND YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE OUR REAR AND YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO THEIR STOMACH AREA AND ONE WAY TO REMEMBER THAT IS TO REMEMBER BUTT TO THE GUT SO YOU TAKE YOUR BOTTOM TO THEIR STOMACH AND YOUR ELBOWS ARE GOING TO TURN ELBOWS OUT THUMBS GOING DOWN AND IT LOOKS LIKE I CALL IT AN EXPLOSION BECAUSE YOU ARE USING YOUR WHOLE BODY JUST LIKE THAT
YOU USE YOUR ENTIRE BODY AND YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE YOUR BOTTOM OUT TO THE BACK
IT HELPS WITH COORDINATION AND MOTOR SKILLS OF THE UPPER BODY AND ALSO HELPS YOU WORK TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO CONTROL YOUR BALANCE IN SPACE AND MOVING DYNAMIC BALANCE
I LIKE TO KEEP THEM CLEAN BUT YOU ALSO DON'T WANT IT TOO ROUGH BECAUSE THEN YOU GET RASHES WHEN YOU GO OUT JUST YOUR BODY SO REALLY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR FLOATABILITY
THEN YOU MIGHT NEED SOME LITTLE FINS BACK THERE BUT MOSTLY WITH A BODY BOARD YOU'RE DOING MOST OF THE CONTROL WITH YOUR FEET THAT ARE BEHIND YOU
HOPEFULLY YOU'VE GOT SOME SWIM FINS ON AND MORE OR LESS LEANING INTO THE RAILS IS HOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE TURNING SO WHEN YOU'RE CHOOSING IT YOU WANT TO FLOAT AND YOU WANT TO KEEP IT CONTROLLED AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN YOU'RE CHOOSING A BODY BOARD
DEFINITELY UP TO YOUR MID CALF BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE COVERING UP ANY FLESH COLORED PARTS OF OUR BODY SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO PUT MAKEUP OVER EVERYTHING
SO MY BODY I'M GOING TO KEEP IT FORWARD YEAH BE CAREFUL WITH MY LOW BACK WITH MY STOMACH DON'T BEND IT OR DON'T PULL OUT
A GREAT WAY TO FIND A RELAXATION IS THINK OF SEVERAL PARTS OF YOUR BODY
AND JUST TO COVER IT UP TO COVER UP THE RUBBER BAND JUST TO GIVE IT SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND TO ADD JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE BODY TO IT WHEN YOU WRAP IT AROUND YOUR HAIR
AND ONE YOU WANT A NICE SMOOTH SWITCH WITH THE BODY AND THE ARMS
KEEP YOUR BODY ALL THE WAY STRAIGHT DON'T CONTRACT YOUR MUSCLES
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT I STEP IN DEEP AND LOAD MY OPPONENT WITH MY BODY SO HE'S ARCHING BACKWARDS
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT I MOVE IN WITH MY WHOLE BODY WEIGHT AND MOMENTUM
YOU'LL NOTICE I STEPPED PAST HIS BODY
AND THOSE TWO DOTS SHOULD LINE UP WHEN YOU PUT THE LENS ON THE BODY AND THEN YOU CAN TWIST THE LENS ON
IN THIS CASE I HAVE AN L LENS WHICH HAS A RED DOT ON THE LENS AND THERE'S A RED DOT ON THE BODY
ANY CANON EFS LENS THERE IS A WHITE DOT ON THE BODY OF THE CANON WHERE THOSE LENSES WILL NEED TO LINE UP
YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM CAN BE COMPROMISED BY VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING STRESS WHEN YOU'RE SO WORKED UP THAT YOUR BODY CAN'T PERFORMANCE NORMAL FUNCTIONS
I'VE GOT GRAVITY COMING DOWN ON THE MUSCLE GROUP AND I'M TRYING TO LIFT MY UPPER BODY AGAINST THE GRAVITY TO CONTRACT THAT MUSCLE
WE'RE EXPLORING JUST LIKE WE DO IN THE BODY HOW DOES THE FACE STRETCH
SO AGAIN LISTEN TO THE COMFORT OF YOUR BODY
MERIDIANS SUPPLY CHI OR KEY WHICH IS SOURCE OR ENERGY THAT GLOWS AND NOURISHES OUR BODY MIND AND SOUL
THEN THERE'S ADDING ON COLOR SHAPE SHADOW SO IN THIS CASE LET'S HAVE THE SHADOW GO ALL AROUND THE BODY SO BRING IT UP OVER HERE ON THE PAWS
IT'S ACTUALLY HELPFUL TO HAVE YOUR WHOLE BODY GET INTO THE DOWN AND THE UP TO GET THE FEELING OF WHEN THE TIMING IS FOR THE POI TO MOVE
LET YOUR BODY LEAD YOU AS YOU FEEL THE WEIGHT GOING DOWN AND UP AND EVENTUALLY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TURN IN A FULL CIRCLE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS
UPPER BODY NICE AND STRAIGHT
ONE OF THE ASPECTS ABOUT IMPROMPTU SPEAKING IS YOUR BODY LANGUAGE ALSO HELPS YOU TO COMMUNICATE WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO BRING MY BODY ALL THE WAY DOWN WATCH YES AND WITH MY HEELS ALL THE WAY AS HIGH AS YOU CAN
SO A COUPLE OF KEY POINTERS TO REMEMBER IS YOU'VE GOT YOUR NINETY DEGREE ANGLES WITH YOUR LOWER BODY YOUR SHOULDERS AND YOUR HEAD NEED TO STAY ON THE BALL
SHE DID NOT TURN HER BODY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU REPRODUCE THIS EXACT SAME THING IT'S ALL BASED ON WHAT YOU FEEL AT THE MOMENT AND WHERE YOU WANT THE LINES TO GO ON THE BODY
SO WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW THIS IS CALLED A WHEEL WEDGE AND I'M BRING IT UP I'M BRINGING IT UP AND WHEN I'M COMING DOWN WITH IT IT'S GOING TO ELIMINATE ANY INCONSISTENCIES THREW OUT THE CLAY BODY AND THEN BRING IT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM HERE
THE PROTOTYPE THAT THEY HAVE FOR ROXY MODELS IS OF COURSE HAVING A YOUNG TEEN WITH YOU KNOW TANNED SKIN TIGHT BODY FIRM YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
TAKE CARE OF YOUR BODY
THIS BODY OF OURS WAS DESIGNED FOR A ACTIVE LIFESTYLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
GO AHEAD AND SWITCH SIDES POST YOUR FOOT IN THE CENTER OF THE BALANCE TRAINER WITH BOTH HANDS ON THE MEDICINE BALL BODY IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION AND YOU ARE GOING TO PUSH FORWARD INSTEAD OF BACK
AND THE IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IN THESE DETAILS ARE THEY SHOULD FOLLOW THE CONTOUR OF THE BODY
SO WE CONTINUE TO BASICALLY COME IN HERE ON THE DETAILS AND WE'RE GOING TO FINISH BASICALLY OUTLINING OUR BODY
SETS ARE USUALLY WOOD AND STAUNTON IN STYLE WHICH IS THE CLASSIC STYLE HERE WITH A STYLIZED BODY AND A CROSS ON THE TOP FOR THE KING
I'M USING MY BODY TO PUSH THIS BOAT SO I PLACE IT RIGHT HERE ON MY SHOULDER I HAVE A FIRM GRIP AND THEN STEP FORWARD TO PUSH
GO ALL THE WAY DOWN VERY CAREFULLY LIFT MY BOAT UP AND THEN I'M USING MY BODY TO PUSH THE BOAT UP LIKE THIS
KEEP YOUR BODY MOVEMENT AND ISOLATED HERE
IN SQUASH SINCE THE UPPER BODY ISN'T AS IMPORTANT AS THE LEGS BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE IT LOOSE AND LIMBER BECAUSE YOU DO DEVELOP A LOT OF YOUR POWER AND STROKE OBVIOUSLY FROM THE UPPER BODY
SO THIS REALLY HELPS LOOSEN UP THE BACK AND ALL PARTS OF THE UPPER BODY
AND YOU'RE REALLY CONTRACTING YOUR WHOLE BODY
YOU DO THIS ABOUT I'LL SAY TEN TO TWELVE REPS YOU'LL DEFINITELY FEEL IT ALL OVER YOUR BODY
NOW NOT AS MUCH ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH THE PIPE WHICH IS LIKE OUR BODY
SO WHEN YOU FALL LET YOUR BODY BOOM AND STOP OR MELT THAT WAY BOOM OR MELT ANYWAY YOU GO BOOM
SO THAT MEANS INSTEAD OF JUST GOING BOOM AND STOPPING YOU WANT TO LET YOUR BODY ROLL REAL SLOW BOOM AND THEN COME TO COMPLETE STOP
INSTEAD OF JUST GOING AND DROPPING DOWN WITH A MELT YOU WOULD WANT TO JUST LET EVERYTHING GO REALLY SLOWLY AND CONTROL YOUR BODY AND GET TO THAT POINT REALLY SLOWLY
YOU SEE THOSE HIGHER NOTES ARE JUST PAST WHERE YOUR THUMB IS GOING TO HIT THE BODY IF YOU HAVE A BASS LIKE THIS
THIS FLY THE BODY OF THIS FLY IS GOING TO BE TAPERED
SO YOU HAVE AN ENERGY THAT COMES FROM THE CENTER OF YOUR BODY INTO YOUR ARMS AND YOUR LEGS
OUR ARMS TAP OUR BODY THE WAIST AND THE KIDNEYS
AND IF YOU NOTICE I'M RISING AND LOWERING MY BODY
SO ACTUALLY STRENGTHENING THAT ENERGY THAT LIFE FORCE THAT MOVES AROUND THE BODY AND MAKES MOTION EASY THAT KEEPS THE JOINT FLUID AND THAT SORT OF THING
KEEP ON THE WAY YOUR HANDS ON THE FLOOR BRING YOUR BODY TO THE RIGHT SIDE BREATH AND RELAX DROP YOUR HEAD
WHEN YOU'RE SITTING AT YOUR DESK JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND JUST GO THROUGH YOUR BODY THIRTY SECONDS EACH AND YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY
NOW THE GREAT THING ABOUT BATH & BODY WORKS IS THEY COME IN THREES SO YOU CAN GET AS MANY FLAVORS AS YOU WANT AND SMELL AS MANY SCENTS AS YOU WANT UNTIL YOU FIND THE SCENT THAT'S GOOD FOR YOU
WHEN A LARGER FISH APPROACHES IT WILL HOVER OVER THE CLEANING STATION AND THE CLEANING GOBIES GO TO WORK BY WORKING THEIR WAY ACROSS THE VISITOR'S BODY EATING THE ACTIVE PARASITES THAT ACCUMULATE ON THE BODY OF THESE FISHES
IT REQUIRES A LOT OF UPPER BODY STRENGTH THAT MANY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE SO I WILL ALSO BE SHOWING SOME MODIFICATIONS TO THIS EXERCISE FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE A LITTLE BIT UPPER BODILY CHALLENGED
A PULL UP IS A GOOD UPPER BODY WORKOUT
START UP AND THEN PULL YOUR BODY DOWN
SO THIS FIRST CENTERING BOOKEND IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CREATE THAT SPACE AND ALLOW YOU TO GO INSIDE AND CREATE AN INTENTION PERHAPS TO REALLY GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR BODY TO BRING THAT MIND-BODY CONNECTION TOGETHER BEFORE YOU BRING BEGIN YOUR PRACTICE
SO YOU WANT TO MAKE A LITTLE V WITH YOUR BODY AND THE FRONT END OF YOUR BIKE AND JUST KIND OF BALANCE THEM OFF
SO THE BASIC ELEMENTS TO THE MANUAL IS THAT YOU COUNTER BALANCE YOUR BODY WITH THE FRONT END OF YOUR BIKE
BUT LIKE I SAID YOU DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THAT EXPOSED FOR VERY LONG SO EITHER KEEP A CAP ON THE BODY OR A LENS ON THE BODY
BASICALLY WHAT YOU DO IS YOUR FULL BODY MAKES A ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREE ROTATION
NOW THIS TOP LEG CAN JUST REST COMFORTABLY OVER YOUR BODY
THE COLORIZATION OF THE LONGFIN DAMSELFISH IS A DARK BROWN TO BLACK OVER ITS ENTIRE BODY AND FINS
IF IN THE TWIST AND A HEAD FIRST ENTRY YOU TWIST MORE THAN WHAT THEY CONSIDER NINETY DEGREES IF I'M DOING A HEAD FIRST ENTRY AND I SHOULD BE LANDING THIS WAY BUT I HAPPEN TO TWIST MY BODY MORE THAN NINETY DEGREES OK THEN THEY'RE GOING TO CONSIDER THAT A FAIL DIVE
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE BODY ROLL IT OUT UNTIL YOU GET INTO A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR ANKLES YOUR KNEES AND YOUR HIPS ARE IN A STRAIGHT LINE
DON'T BE AFRAID TO USE YOUR BODY TO HELP YOU EXPRESS WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY
AND OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY YOU CAN HELP YOUR PARTNER WITH ARE THEIR HANDS AND THEIR FEET
AND THIS FIRST THING YOU CAN DO IS JUST START MASSAGING THE SCALP OR THE EARS AND THOSE ARE TWO REALLY NICE AREAS OF THE BODY TO START MASSAGING AND THEY REALLY REALLY FEEL GOOD
AND THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE AREAS OF THE BODY THAT YOU CAN HELP YOUR PARTNER RELAX AND HAVE A NICE RELAXING EVENING ESPECIALLY WITH THE CANDLES AND THE MUSIC
WHEN YOU HAVE A BAD GRIP YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THE CLUB MOVING WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY
ONE I CAN THROW THE SIDE KICK TO THE BODY
SINCE YOU ARE NOT DOING IT WITH ANY TYPE OF WEIGHT DUMBBELL OR BARBELL YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO KEEP IT HIGH REPS SINCE IT'S SO LOW ON WEIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST DOING YOUR BODY WEIGHT SO CONTINUE THIS MOTION AGAIN FOR ABOUT TWENTY REPS OF THREE TO FOUR SETS AND THAT'S THE FREESTANDING SQUAT
SO BY DOING QIGONG WE LEARN TO MOVE THE BODY ALONG WITH MOVING THE ENERGY INSIDE OF US SO THAT WE CAN UNBLOCK THOSE AREAS THAT TEND TO ARE SLOW IN QI OR END UP BEING BLOCKED BY THE FLOW OF ENERGY
WE HAVE MERIDIANS INSIDE OF OUR BODY THAT IF THE QI DOESN'T FLOW PROPERLY THROUGHOUT THE BODY THAT IS WHERE THE BELIEF THAT SICKNESS AND ILL HEALTH SETS IN
BASICALLY WE JUST WANT TO PLACE THE JACK UNDERNEATH THIS LOWER LIP OF THE BODY PANEL THERE WHERE IT'S DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THE WEIGHT AND THEN WE'RE JUST GOING TO SCREW IT UP AND LIFT THE CAR UP SO WE CAN REMOVE THE WHEEL
SO WE'RE GOING TO STOP START AT THE TOP OF THE BODY AND GO THROUGH TO THE BACK OF THE BODY AND SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF MANEUVERS THAT YOU CAN DO
SO START RIGHT HERE AS WE MOVE IN TOWARD THAT OPPONENT MALE A CIRCLE TIGHTEN THAT WRIST UP AND STRIKE I WANT TO DROP MY WHOLE BODY WEIGHT DOWN OVER THAT PERSON
ONE MORE TIME SLOW I'M GOING TO STEP IN MAKE A FULL CIRCLE AND CLOSE THAT HAND AND DROP MY BODY DOWN
SO WE HAVE A PERSON DOWN ON THE GROUND I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE FIRST JUST THE MOVEMENT YOU'RE GOING TO START WITH THE STAGGERED STANCE BOTH HANDS ARE UP NOW TO GENERATE POWER FOR THAT FOR THE STRIKE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THE HAND STRIKING IS GOING TO MAKE A CIRCLE THAT'S GOING TO CLOSE AND YOU'RE GOING TO DROP THAT BODY WEIGHT STRAIGHT DOWN ON YOUR TARGET
SO INSTEAD WE KEEP OUR KOTEGAEISHIS VERY SMALL AND YOU'LL SEE FROM THE NEXT ONE I CONTROL THE ENTIRE BODY WITH THIS
'AIR SQUATS ARE THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL EXERCISE FOR THE LOWER BODY
SO IF YOU ARE COMMITTED IN YOUR BODY LANGUAGE AND POSTURE IT HELPS YOU STAY COMMITTED MENTALLY TO WHAT YOU ARE DOING
BEHIND THE BACK GRABS IN FRONT OF THE BODY GRABS NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO THE FINAL SECTION OF THE YELLOW BELT TEST WHICH IS STRIKES
I'M MOVING THE UPPER BODY IN GOING DOWN ACROSS LIKE AN AX
NOW WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE TWIST JUST LIKE YOU HAVE AN AX AND YOU'RE CHOPPING WOOD YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE SAME THING WITH THE BALL AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME ACROSS THE BODY
WHAT THE IDEA IS TO GET THAT TWIST IN THERE TO WORK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BODY
WE CAN GO WITH YOU KNOW MOVEMENTS OF THE BODY
ONCE IT'S ON PAPER WE THEN TAKE THEIR BODY PART WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT ON SEE IF IT FITS RIGHT
IT GETS A LITTLE IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU GO THROUGH SURGERY YOUR BODY GETS A LITTLE TRAUMA
SO YOUR HEAD COVERING AND AROUND YOUR NECK BECOME VERY VERY CRITICAL TO MAINTAIN YOUR BODY HEAT IN SUB ZERO TEMPERATURES
A NICE SILK SCARF WRAPPED AROUND YOUR NECK WILL INCREASE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WHILE YOU'RE ON STAND BY A GOOD FIFTEEN TO TWENTY DEGREES
THIS KEEPS THE HEAT FROM TOO MUCH HEAT FORM ESCAPING AROUND YOUR NECK AND YOUR OPEN COLLAR AREA AND THIS ALSO WORKS AS A REGULATOR SO YOU CAN REGULATE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE
BECAUSE NOW ALL MY MOISTURE ALL THAT'S COMING EVAPORATING OUT OF MY BODY ESCAPES AROUND MY GLASSES
YOU STILL GOT TO USE THE PRODUCT BECAUSE WE KNOW GOLD IS VERY ADAPTABLE IN THE MOUTH AND THE BODY IS VERY FORGIVING WITH THE GOLD
YOU CAN STRETCH OUT YOUR HIP FLEXORS IN THE FRONT OF YOUR HIPS BY KNEELING ON ONE KNEE AND PUSHING YOUR HIPS FORWARD STRETCHING OUT YOUR BACK MUSCLES BY SITTING RIGHT BACK ON YOUR HEELS AND REACHING ACROSS YOUR BODY
