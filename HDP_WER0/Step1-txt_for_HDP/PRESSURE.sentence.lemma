ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR JACK STANDS SET YOU CAN VERY SLOWLY RELEASE THE PRESSURE ON YOUR FLOOR JACK
BOOM AND THEN APPLY THE PRESSURE INWARD
SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD A LITTLE MORE PRESSURE CAUSE SHE HAS LIKE AN ARTIFICIAL NAIL RIGHT ON THE EDGE THERE SO I'M GOING TO JUST GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE PRESSURE AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL OVER IT JUST TO FEEL ONCE YOU DON'T FEEL ANY MORE BUMPS THEN YOU CAN START WITH YOUR BUFFER AND CONTINUE UNTIL YOU'VE GOT IT USED ALL THREE SIDES
SO I'M GOING TO HAVE THIS PRESSURE PULLING
NOT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THE ELBOW OKAY
IT MAY NOT ACTUALLY GO FLAT UNTIL YOU GET OUT ON THE ROAD AND IT ACTUALLY HAS SOME SERIOUS PRESSURE UNDER IT AND THEN YOU'LL END UP FIXING ANOTHER FLAT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THAT'S NO GOOD
REAL EVEN AMOUNT OF PRESSURE YOU CAN COUNT YOUR STROKES AGAIN BUT JUST MAKE SURE THEY'RE REAL FLAT
FOR THIS I'M JUST GOING TO SAY I WANT IT RIGHT HERE IN THIS AREA AND YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO TAKE YOUR DRILL PLACE IT ON THAT MARK APPLY A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE TO IT AND THEN YOU JUST WANT TO DRILL AWAY
ULTIMATELY YOU JUST WANT TO LET THE HEAD RELAX AND LET THE BODY RELAX AND LET THE PRESSURE FEEL GOOD
THE SECOND IS YOUR PRESSURE FELT AND THIS ACTUALLY IS A BIT THICKER THAN THE OTHER ONES AND IT'S GOING TO ALLOW THAT PAPER TO BE MOLDED DOWN INTO THE MATRIX AND PULL OUT THE INK
A DOG WITH ELBOW DYSPLASIA DOESN'T LIKE THIS MASSAGE TO START WITH IN WHICH CASE YOU WANT WITH JUST SOME SOFT GENTLE MOVEMENT JUST MOVE YOUR HANDS OVER THE SKIN DON'T PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON IT AND GRADUALLY WORK YOUR WAY UP
THE NEXT THING YOU ARE GOING TO DO IS ACTUALLY MASSAGE THE ELBOW ITSELF ACTUALLY PUTTING PRESSURE ALL THE WAY AROUND NICE CIRCULAR MOTION WITH YOUR FINGERS ABOVE AND BELOW THE JOINT FRONT AND BACK ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH AND ALONG THE FRONT OF THE LEG
ONE THING THAT I KNOW THAT A LOT OF DRIVERS DON'T DO IS WHEN THEY GET ALL TENSED UP AND THEY BELTED DOWN IN THOSE PRESSURE THEY DON'T BREATH
THE CALIPER THEN PUTS PRESSURE ON BRAKES PADS SUCH AS THIS THIS IS A BRAKE PAD AND THAT PRESSURE THEN PUSHES ON THE ROTOR AND APPLIES STOPPING POWER TO THAT ROTOR
NOW WE NEED TO RELEASE A LOT OF THAT PRESSURE VERY FAST
VERY CAREFULLY I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PUT THIS PAN IN HERE AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS TO THIS LITTLE PRESSURE BELL
THIS IS A QUICK SOAKING METHOD TO USE WITH THE PRESSURE COOKER
NOW I HAVE JUST BEEN COOKING THESE BEANS IN FIFTEEN POUNDS OF PRESSURE FOR JUST TWO MINUTES
RIGHT NOW WE ARE MAKING BLACK BEANS IN A PRESSURE COOKER
A LOT OF TIMES TOO YOU SEE THIS EXCESS STUFF ON THE EDGE YOU JUST SIMPLY JUST TAKE YOUR FINGER AND IT COMES RIGHT OFF JUST LIKE THAT YOU GIVE A LITTLE PRESSURE TO IT IT'S REALLY NOT A BIG DEAL
GO ABOUT AN INCH ABOVE THE EAR APPLYING PRESSURE HERE PARTICULARLY IF IT FEELS GOOD TO APPLY PRESSURE AND MOVING AROUND THE EAR
YOU WANT PRESSURE ON THE BALL OF THE FOOT
PUT PRESSURE ON THAT TOE
WHAT I'M ACTUALLY DOING ON THIS IS PUTTING MY HAND IN THE CROOK OF HIS ELBOW AND COLLAPSING IT TO CAUSE PRESSURE RIGHT HERE
SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE THAT COMES WITH THAT
A WATER PRESSURE OF EIGHTY POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH
CHRONIC STRESS HAS BEEN FOUND IN NUMEROUS STUDIES TO CONTRIBUTE TO A WIDE RANGE OF ILLNESSES AND CONDITIONS INCLUDING ANXIETY DEPRESSION HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE INSOMNIA HEART IRREGULARITIES AND RECENTLY IT'S ALSO BEEN LINKED TO HEART ATTACKS AND HEART DISEASE
AND WHAT THAT DOES IS WHEN THEY ELEVATE THEIR HEAD IT PUTS PRESSURE ON IT AND BRINGS IT BACK DOWN
AND AS THEY DO YOU LET THEM RELAX AND ONCE YOU FEEL TENSION LIGHTEN UP UNDERNEATH YOU GOING TO LET THAT PERSON RELAX AND YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE THEIR HEAD BACK INTO POSITION AND YOU'RE GOING TO MAINTAIN THAT SAME PRESSURE IN THAT SAME SPOT AS YOU HOLD THAT HEAD UP
NOT WITH TOO MUCH PRESSURE JUST GIVE IT A LITTLE TUG
IF YOU NOTICE I AM STARTING OFF WITH THE PROPER STANCE AND I WILL BE APPLYING FORWARD PRESSURE TO THE LEFT FOOT THEN FORWARD PRESSURE TO THE RIGHT FOOT
ALONG WITH THIS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE TAKING OFF A LITTLE PRESSURE OFF YOUR UPHILL SKI
SO IF WE ARE GOING TO BE MAKING A LEFT HILL TURN WE ARE GOING TO BE APPLYING PRESSURE TO THE RIGHT BOOT
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS APPLY FORWARD PRESSURE TO THE BOOT THIS IS GOING TO BE YOUR DOWNHILL SKI
SO USE LIGHT PRESSURE MODERATE PRESSURE HEAVIER PRESSURE
AND BECAUSE THIS IS OFTEN IN A SENSITIVE AREA ON A HORSE I ONLY USE LIGHT PRESSURE THEIR LONGER THEN I MIGHT IN ANOTHER AREA JUST TO GET THINGS LOOSENED UP
WHAT YOU WANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS PUTTING FORWARD PRESSURE AND ALLOWING THE SKI TO WORK WITH ITS ACTUAL SHAPE INSTEAD OF MUSCLE THE SKI AROUND LIKE BEFORE
THE DIFFERENCE IS INSTEAD LAYING SO MUCH PRESSURE ON THIS FOOT AND SWITCHING YOUR BODY AROUND YOU ARE GOING TO PUT FORWARD PRESSURE ON YOUR BOOT WHICH IS GOING TO ALLOW THE INSIDE EDGE OF THE SKI TO WORK BY ITSELF AND CARVE THE TURN OUT
WHEN YOU ARE SHIFTING FEET WHAT YOU DO IS SHIFT WEIGHT TO THE FORWARD PRESSURE OF THIS BOOT AND THIS WILL HELP YOU CARVE OUT THIS TURNOUT
THE PRESSURE DECREASES SO THAT'S WHY THE DIASTOLIC IS A LITTLE BIT LOWER
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR BOTTOM DOESN'T DROP PUTTING PRESSURE ON YOUR LOWER BACK
WE HAVE LEARNED HOW TO PUT THE PRESSURE ON SKIS TO A DEGREE
YOU CAN DO A STEADY ONE FINGER PRESSURE JUST STAYING IN THAT PLACE OR YOU CAN DO A CIRCULAR MOTION WITH YOUR THUMB OR WITH THE BALL OF YOUR FINGER
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR PRESSURE
IT'S KIND OF SOOTHING BUT YET GIVES A NICE DEEP FIRM PRESSURE
SO YOU'RE SITTING TALL INHALING EXHALING THROUGH YOUR NOSE BREATHS ARE LONG AND STRONG AND JUST BRING A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE BETWEEN THE PALMS
SEE IF YOU CAN HOLD THIS FOR SAY FIVE TO TEN BREATHS JUST THAT GENTLE GENTLE GENTLE PRESSURE MAKING YOU AWARE OF YOUR CENTER POINT MAKING YOU AWARE OF THIS POWER IN YOUR ARMS AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE EXHALE TO RELEASE JUST LET YOUR ARMS FALL TO YOUR KNEES
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE DIABETES QIGONG HAS EVEN BEEN KNOWN TO EVEN HELP WITH THE REMISSION OF CANCER
OKAY SOMETIMES IN SQUASH YOUR OPPONENT PUTS YOU UNDER A GREAT PRESSURE AND SO AS WE'VE SHOWN YOUR TRADITIONAL BACK HAND DROP SHOT WILL BE SOMEWHAT LIKE A MINI GROUND STROKE OR MINI VOLLEY IT'LL BE LIKE THAT
YOU PUT THAT PRESSURE THERE JUST A STEADY PRESSURE OR YOU CAN DO A ROCKING MOTION JUST BACK AND FORTH AND BACK AND FORTH AND THAT'S ONE THAT SHE OBJECTS TO AND THIS WILL HAPPEN SOMETIMES WITH YOUR ANIMAL THAT THEY WILL OBJECT TO A POINT
WITH THE STYLE OF BOWS NOW DAYS YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHAT TYPE OF PRESSURE YOU USE
MOVE DOWN AND A LITTLE BIT BACK AND YOU'RE GOING TO FALL INTO A SPACE BETWEEN THE MUSCLE TENDON AND THE BONE AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUT STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN PRESSURE IN THAT AREA
SO THERE'S GOING TO BE THIS PRESSURE AND DISCOMFORT HERE IN THIS AREA IN ORDER TO AND AS I WORK THIS AREA IT WILL HELP TO ACTUALLY BALANCE OUT THE ADRENALS IN HER BODY
OKAY SO HIS BLOOD PRESSURE THERE WAS NOW ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY OVER EIGHTY
SO WE JUST TOOK BOB TO HIS TARGET HEART RATE AND WE SAW THAT HE DID SOME EXERCISE AND NOW WE WANT TO DEMONSTRATE SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN HIS BLOOD PRESSURE NOW THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT
HI I AM DOCTOR TERRANELLA AND WE WANT TO DEMONSTRATE SOME OF THE CHANGES IN BLOOD PRESSURE THAT OCCUR WITH ACTIVITY
WE HAVE A TARGET FRAME HERE WHICH WAS BUILT OUT OF PRESSURE TREATED WOOD
SO WHAT I NEED TO DO IS AS HE ADDS PRESSURE IN IS I KEEP THE BALLOON BUT I SIT AND TURN
WITH NINETY POUNDS OF PRESSURE WITH A CHILD THAT CANNOT HOLD THEIR HEAD UP YET
AND STUDIES HAVE ACTUALLY SHOWN THAT THE DOCTORS PULL WITH ABOUT A FORCE OF ABOUT NINETY POUNDS OF PRESSURE
SO YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DRAG YOUR FOOT UP PUT PRESSURE ON THE NOSE POP OUT AND MAKE SURE YOUR WHEELS CLEAR THE TOP OF THE OBSTACLE
AFTER YOU'VE OLLIED OVER THE BEGINNING OF THE LEDGE YOU WANT TO GO OVER THE TOP LAND ON TOP OF THE LEDGE PUTTING ALL THE PRESSURE RIGHT HERE AND HANGING YOUR NOSE JUST OVER THE TIP OF THE LEDGE ITSELF
SO YOU WANT TO GET A GOOD SOLID FEEL ON HOW MUCH PRESSURE YOU WANT TO PUT INTO THAT KITE
IF YOU HAVE KITE OR A PUMP RIGHT HERE SOMETIMES IT'LL COME WITH A PRESSURE GAUGE
THAT TOP NUMBER IS YOUR SYSTOLIC PRESSURE AND THE BOTTOM NUMBER IS YOUR DIASTOLIC PRESSURE AND WHAT THOSE PRESSURES REPRESENT IS A PRESSURE WITHIN THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM WHICH IS THE AORTA AND THIS IS A REPRESENTATION OF THE PRESSURE IN THE AORTA WHEN YOU TAKE SOMEONE'S BLOOD PRESSURE
SO THE SYSTOLIC PRESSURE IS THE PRESSURE WITHIN THE AORTA JUST AFTER THAT HEART CONTRACTS
THIS AORTA IS FILLED UP WITH HIGHER AMOUNTS OF PRESSURE
WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT BLOOD PRESSURE IS
BLOOD PRESSURE IS DIVIDED INTO SYSTOLIC PRESSURE AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURE AND THOSE PRESSURES REPRESENT DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE CARDIAC CYCLE
SO IT'S THE PRESSURE WITHIN THE AORTA OR THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM MORE SO THE BRACHIAL ARTERY AFTER THAT HEART CONTRACTS
THE DIASTOLIC PRESSURE IS THE PRESSURE WITHIN THAT ARTERIAL SYSTEM JUST AFTER THE HEART RELAXES SO WE HAVE CONSTANT CONTRACTION RIGHT HERE IN THIS VENTRICLE SHOOTS BLOOD UP THROUGH THE AORTA AND THEN IT RELAXES
THIS SHOCK ABSORBER CONTAINS PRESSURE IT IS CONSTANTLY TRYING TO PUSH OUTWARDS SO IT HOLDS IT SELF IN PLACE PRETTY GOOD
I'M NOT APPLYING ANY PRESSURE TO THE ROLLER I'M JUST LETTING IT CLOSE ALONG THE WALL
WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO IS THAT THE SPINE IS THE HOUSE THAT PROTECTS THE NERVES THAT ARE TRANSMITTING THESE MESSAGES AND SO AS THE SPINE GETS MISALIGNED AS THE SPINE GETS TORN OR TWISTED OR WHAT HAVE YOU IT PUTS PRESSURE ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT THEN IS SENDING THE MESSAGE OUT AND WHICH CAN BE PAIN OR FUNCTION
SO PAIN FIBERS ARE BEING AFFECTED AND THEY ARE GOING TO FEEL PAIN WHETHER IT IS BURNING OR RADIATING PAIN LOCAL PAIN MUSCLE TENSION PRESSURE OR THOSE KINDS OF THINGS
SO I LIKE TO DO IS LITTLE CIRCLES IN THIS LOCATION AND JUST CLOSE MY EYES AND RELAX AND WITH THE PRESSURE JUST FEEL THE MUSCLES UNDERNEATH RELAXING FREEING UP CLEARING OF ANY PAIN
THIS ONE I DO MORE OF A FLAT SURFACE PRESSURE
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT PREFER DEEPER BUT JUST OVERALL KIND OF JUST PRESSURE AND BIGGER CIRCLES AGAIN CLOSING THE EYES AND IF A DARK ROOM IS HELPFUL THAT CAN ALSO BE BENEFICIAL
YOU'LL FEEL SOME PRESSURE
BACK OFF GO DOWN TO MODERATE PRESSURE AGAIN GO DOWN TO LIGHT PRESSURE FINISH UP WITH LIGHT PRESSURE
SO IT'S JUST LIKE THIS IT'S NOTHING GREAT BUT IT'S A REALLY EFFECTIVE SHOT FOR WHEN YOU'RE UNDER GREAT PRESSURE
ALSO WITH THE WET RAZOR YOU CAN BETTER CONTROL THE PRESSURE OF THE RAZOR HITTING THE SKIN
I'M GOING TO TAKE AND RUN MY PRESSURE WASHER AND CLEAN IT UP ALL REAL GOOD AND GET OFF ALL THE DIRT AND LOSE DEBRIS AND THAN I'M GOING TO TAKE AND SPRAY AND PAT ON TWO COATS OF A SOLID STAIN
YOU CAN CHECK OCCASIONALLY BY RUNNING YOUR HAND OVER IT TO SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY BUMPS OR LUMPS AND THEN YOU CAN PUT A LITTLE MORE PRESSURE ON THAT PART THAT IS MORE LUMPY
SO WE PUT SLOW PRESSURE INTO THE BOTTOM AND THEN PULL
AND AS I WORK MY WAY DOWN THE FOOT NEAR THE WAIST I'LL COME AT A SIDEWAYS MOTION AND THEN AS I WORK DOWN TOWARDS THE INTESTINES OR THE HEEL I'LL TAKE MY FIST AND KNUCKLE AND APPLY FIRM PRESSURE WITH ROTATING MOTION WHICH REALLY STIMULATES THE NEURAL IMPULSE AND FEELS PRETTY GOOD
THEN IN THE NEXT SEGMENT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT OF THE PHYSIOLOGY BEHIND HOW THAT BLOOD PRESSURE IS CHANGING
SO WE TOOK BOB'S BLOOD PRESSURE EARLIER IT WAS AROUND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY OVER EIGHTY AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO HAVE HIM EXERCISE AND TAKE HIS BLOOD PRESSURE AGAIN AND SEE HOW THOSE CHANGES OCCUR
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO INVITE THE PALMS TO YOUR HEART AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE EQUAL PRESSURE BETWEEN THE KNEES AND THE PALMS
OKAY AND YOU FEEL THE PRESSURE ON THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT
AND TAKE THAT PRESSURE OFF OF YOU THATWHAT IF I DO THE WRONG THING
SO I'M GOING TO COME OVER UNDER MY KNEES AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO SPREAD MY TOES AS WIDE AS I CAN AND JUST SIT BACK ON MY HEELS ADDING A LITTLE PRESSURE
AND YOU WANT TO GIVE SOME KIND OF DEADLINE FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY WITHIN WHICH TIME TO RESPOND BECAUSE IT WILL PUT SOME PRESSURE ON THEM TO RESPOND TO THE DEMAND
THE NEXT THING THAT WE NEED TO DO IS RELIEVE ANY WATER PRESSURE THAT IS STILL IN THE LINES SO YOU CAN GO TO ANY FAUCET IN YOUR HOUSE AND TURN THAT ON AND WAIT TILL ALL THAT PRESSURE HAS BEEN RELIEVED FROM THE FAUCET
IF WE ARE GOING TO BE MAKING A LEFT HILL TURN WE ARE GOING TO APPLY FORWARD PRESSURE TO YOUR LEFT BOOT
AN AIRLESS SPRAYER PUMPS THE PAINT THROUGH YOUR ORIFICE AND MAKES IT OUT INTO YOUR PINE SPRAY FINISH AND YOU HAVE YOUR ADJUSTMENT ON HERE TO ADJUST YOUR PRESSURE
I ADJUST THE PRESSURE WAY DOWN TO PUT IT ON A DECK BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO THIS YOUR NOZZLE OR YOUR TIP IS ONLY GOING TO BE ABOUT SIX TO TEN INCHES OFF YOUR DECK AND YOU SPRAY IT BACK AND FORTH AND PUT YOUR PRODUCT WHEN YOU NEED IT AND THEN MY HELP COMES ALONG AND YOU PAD IT DOWN INTO THE DECK AND IT MAKES A GREAT FINISH
BUT IN USED IN A PERFORMANCE HORSE THIS IS GOING TO PUT ENOUGH PRESSURE TO THE ROOF OF THEIR MOUTH THAT WITH VERY LITTLE HAND MOVEMENT THIS BIT IS GOING TO PUT THEM RIGHT WHERE I NEED THEM WITHOUT ANY HAND MOVEMENT ON MY PART
I'M PUSHING IN WITH THE POINTED AREA AND GENTLY TWISTING SO THAT I DON'T HAVE TO PUSH HAVE TOO MUCH PRESSURE GOING INWARDS AND ONCE I'VE GOT THE LARGE HOLE CUT I CAN MAKE LITTLE MARKS AT SYMMETRICAL LOCATIONS FOR THE MID-GRADE SIZE AND FINALLY WITH THE SMALLEST SIZE
STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN PRESSURE ON BOTH SIDES
AND THAT WILL PUT LESS PRESSURE ON THE GOOD LEG AND ALLOW THEM TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE
IT WOULD ONLY TAKE A MINUTE TO DO A QUICK RELEASE OF PRESSURE AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND COOK THE BEANS ONE MORE TIME FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES
I DON'T WANT THE COLD WATER GETTING INSIDE THE PAN BUT SEE THIS PRESSURE IS DROPPING DRAMATICALLY IT HAS GONE FROM FIFTEEN POUNDS IT IS NOW ALMOST PASSED THE EIGHT POUND MARK
A MANUAL ALSO CALLED A WHEELIE IS WHEN YOU BALANCE ON YOUR BACK TWO WHEELS ALONE PROVIDING EQUAL AMOUNT OF PRESSURE TO THE TAIL IN THE CENTER OF YOUR BOARD THEREFORE YOU DO NOT WANT TO SCRAPE YOUR TAIL OR LET YOUR FRONT WHEELS HIT
YOU CAN THEN JUST INFLATE IT TO YOU KNOW RECOMMENDED INFLATION PRESSURE
YOU'LL WANT TO KEEP SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THIS STRING
EQUAL PRESSURE ON THE PEDALS ALL THE WAY AROUND
SOME OF THOSE ONES THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO GET OFF YOU MIGHT EVEN TRY GOING TO A CAR WASH AND USING THE HIGH PRESSURE GUN ON
NOW YOU WANT TO GENTLY UNSCREW IT A LITTLE BIT OF PULL PRESSURE AS YOU DO THAT ALL RIGHT BECAUSE THIS PIECE RIGHT OVER HERE ON THE MAST YOU DON'T WANT TO BREAK ALL RIGHT
YOU SHOULD FEEL A NICE OPENING THROUGH YOUR SODS HERE AND IF YOU'RE FEELING LOTS AND LOTS OF PRESSURE ON YOUR FRONT THIGH IT S BECAUSE YOU'RE LEANING TO FAR FORWARD
NOW ON THE FOREHAND SIDE YOU CAN GO LEFT BIG AND RIGHT AND YOU CAN COVER A HUGE AMOUNT OF COURT AND YOU USUALLY DO THAT WHEN YOU ARE UNDER SOME TYPE OF PRESSURE AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE IN THE STRONGEST POSITION SO YOU CAN SEE IF YOU ARE HERE YOU'RE IN KIND OF A RELATIVELY WEAK POSITION AND YOU CAN TURN IT AROUND AND IT WILL BE A GOOD SHOT BUT GETTING TO THE CORNER IN A MORE UPRIGHT POSITION IS BETTER
AS SOON AS ALL FOURS HIT THE GROUND I RELEASE PRESSURE OFF THE LEASH STAND AND SHE SHOULD REMAIN IN A DOWN POSITION
THIS HAND GOES PALM UP SLIGHTLY FORWARD PRESSURE AND I'M USING MY FOREARM AGAINST HER SIDE TO HAVE HER DOWN
IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE AT HOME THAT CAN HELP YOU WITH THIS EXERCISE I CAN ACTUALLY APPLY PRESSURE UNTIL SHE FEELS THAT TENSION AND MAKES IT A LITTLE EASIER FOR HER AND THEN SHE CAN TELL ME WHEN SHE IS THERE AND THEN WE WOULD RELEASE AND THEN THE LAST STEP SHE WILL BE UP AND OVER HER HEAD AND SHE WILL DO THAT TRICEP STRETCH
HORSES MOVE AWAY FROM PRESSURE SO WHEN I SQUEEZE WITH MY LEFT LEG HE'S GOING TO WANT TO MOVE TO THE RIGHT
DO A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE POINT A LOT OF DARK CIRCLES CAN BE CAUSED FROM EITHER SINUS CONGESTION OR JUST BECAUSE THE SKIN IS SO THIN THERE A LOT OF BLOOD LAYING VERY CLOSE TO THE SURFACE
TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON IT WILL CLOSE UP THE PORES
WE CAN PICK UP THE BOX PUT IT ON THE PRESSURE PLATE AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOT QUITE THE EXIT YET
I START WITH LIGHT PRESSURE FIRST TO JUST KIND OF GET THE CIRCULATION GET THE LIQUID BUILD UP MOVE DOWN AND ESPECIALLY WITH THIS WATER CAUSE YOU ARE MOVING TOXINS YOU ARE MOVING THE BUILD UP FLUID THAT CAUSE THE KNUCKLES THE SWOLLEN KNUCKLES AND GETTING THE CIRCULATION BACK
AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH PRESSURE YOU PUT ON THIS YOU WILL STILL BE ABLE TO UNTIE IT
AND THE THINGS TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH PRESSURE YOU'RE GOING TO REMOVE THE RIDGES IN THE NAIL IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON THE SIZE OF THE RIDGE
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO GO LIFTING YOUR HEELS UP LIKE THIS BUT YOU WANT TO FEEL THE PRESSURE OKAY ON THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT
NOW GATHER UP THE EXTRA BAG AND IN YOUR HAND LIKE THIS WITH YOUR THUMB AND YOUR FINGER HOLDING THE PASTRY BAG AND YOUR PALM IS GOING TO DO THE SQUEEZING YOU TWIST THE BAG SO THIS YOUR THUMB AND YOUR FINGER ARE HOLDING THE EXCESS BAG AND YOU'RE TWISTING LIKE THIS TO PUT SOME PRESSURE ON THE CONTENT
YOU'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING SOME PRESSURE ON THERE
IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PRESSURE WASH YOUR POOL DECK AREA
SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE PRESSURE WASHER IN A LARGER SWEEPING MOTION
