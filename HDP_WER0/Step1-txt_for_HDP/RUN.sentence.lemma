HEY MY NAME IS ADDISON FROM CAPTAIN BILLS AND I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO RUN BASIC VOLLEYBALL DRILLS
SO IF YOU RUN FOUR FOUR ONE OVER AND OVER TO GET YOUR THE THE PASSES LIKE HERE PRETTY CLEAN THIS WILL REALLY HELP CLEAN UP YOUR TWO IN ONE HAND AND YOUR FOUR CLUB PATTERN
ANOTHER OPTION YOU HAVE IS IF IT REQUIRES CERTAIN FEATURES BUGS OR QUIRKS OF A CERTAIN OPERATING SYSTEM THERE IS AN OPTION UNDER MOST OF THESE UNDER COMPATIBILITY TO RUN IT IN COMPATIBILITY MODE FOR WHATEVER APPLICATION YOU WANT
YOU CAN EVEN GO BACK AS FAR AS NT4.0 AS YOUR COMPATIBILITY VERSION ALLOWING YOU TO GET SOME REALLY OLD CRANKY APPLICATIONS TO RUN UNDER VISTA
I'M DAN AFONSO AND THIS HAS BEEN HOW TO RUN OLDER APPLICATIONS UNDER VISTA
THE PINCH HITTER CAN BE EXPECTED TO BUNT HE CAN BE EXPECTED TO HIT A HOME RUN HE CAN BE EXPECTED TO WALK
SO FOR OUR TAIL RUNNING THE MORE THAT YOU CAN OR THE MORE THAT YOU CAN RUN ON TRAILS THE MORE EFFECTIVE A TRAIL RUN RACER YOU WILL BE
WHAT YOU DON'T WANT IS A ROUNDED POSITION FOR THE SPINE TO GET OUT OF SO THAT YOU RUN THE RISK OF INJURING THE LOWER BACK
OKAY NOW ONCE YOU'VE FINISHED YOUR ACUPRESSURE POINTS YOU'VE DONE YOUR MASSAGE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU NOT JUST LEAP UP AND RUN OFF AND HAVE THE DOG COME CHASING AFTER YOU OR YOU THROW THE DOG OUT IN THE YARD OR HAVE HIM PLAY WITH THE KIDS
AT THIS POINT I'M JUST GOING TO RUN MY FINGERS THROUGH IT AND MAKE IT AS MESSY AND TEXTURED AS I POSSIBLY CAN
AND IF THOSE PINS RUN AWAY YOU CAN JUST TAKE THEM OUT
I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND RUN A SEAM ALONG THE OTHER LEG
I'M GOING TO JUST GRAB A GAME HERE AND IF YOU JUST WANT TO SEE THAT A GAME WASN'T WORKING OR ANY PROGRAM REALLY WASN'T WORKING BEFORE TRY IT OUT AND JUST RIGHT CLICK ON IT AND RUN IT AS ADMINISTRATOR AND OBVIOUSLY I AM ASSUMING YOU HAVE FULL CONTROL OF THE MACHINE AND THE ADMINISTRATOR PASSWORD
WHEN YOU RUN IT LIKE THIS IT WILL GO IN AND RUN IT UNDER FULL PRIVILEGE MODE AND THAT FIXES THE ISSUE AND WHAT YOU NOW NEED TO DO IS TO RIGHT CLICK ON IT CLICK ON PROPERTIES GO OVER TO COMPATIBILITY AND CHECK OFF RUN THIS PROGRAM AS ADMINISTRATOR
HI I'M DAN AFONSO WITH AFONSO CONSULTING AND ENFOLD IT AND THIS IS HOW TO RUN OLD PROGRAMS IN VISTA
DID YOU KNOW THAT EVEN PROGRAMS MADE FOR WINDOWS 2000 WILL RUN ON VISTA
THE CHICKEN LINES THAT RUN ALONG THE OUTSIDE OF THE RAFT IF YOU ARE ON THE WAY OUT OF THE BOAT FOR ANY REASON YOU CAN GRAB HOLD OF THIS AND THAT KEEPS YOU CLOSE TO THE RAFT AND HOPEFULLY YOUR CREW CAN PULL YOU BACK IN
OK I'M TAKING AND RELEASING THE HALYARD FROM THE MAIN AND I'M GOING TO RUN IT TO THE BACK OF THE BOAT
BUT CONSIDERING YOUR OTHER OPTION IS REALLY A SILICONE JUGGLING BALL THAT RUN ANYWHERE FROM $30 TO $50 DOLLAR A PIECE
BASICALLY ALL YOU WANT TO DO ON YOUR WIRE IS YOU ARE GOING TO GET YOUR UTILITY KNIFE AND THIS IS A LITTLE TRICKY BUT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PUT ONE SIDE OF THE BLADE NEXT TO YOUR WIRE AND PUT YOUR THUMB ACROSS THE BLADE AND IN A CIRCULAR MOTION RUN THE BLADE IN A CIRCLE
AND I'LL GO AHEAD AND JUST RUN IT RIGHT OVER THE BOARD
THE HOTTER THAT YOU RUN THEM WHICH MEANS THE LOUDER THAT YOU TURN UP IS GOING TO BE CAUSING THEM TO LOSE LIFE FASTER
SO YOU ARE GOING TO PROBABLY WANT TO CHANGE THEM IF YOU ARE PLAYING WITH IT REGULARLY ABOUT ONCE A YEAR IS WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO START TO RUN OUT OR START TO NOT SOUND AS GOOD AS THEY USED TO SOUND
THERE'S A BUNCH OF BRUTES AND SEVERAL OF THEM HAVE JET PACKS SO THIS WOULDN'T BE AN EASY FIGHT ON FOOT BUT THE CHOPPER MACHINE GUN IS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO TAKE THEM OUT QUICKLY AND IT DOESN'T RUN OUT OF AMMUNITION
SO WE'RE GOING TO RUN IT IN A LITTLE BIT FASTER TIME
AND WHAT THIS ALLOWS TO HAPPEN IS IN A LOT OF CASES WHEN IT'S A RUN BALL HE'S GOING TO BLOW THIS MAN OUT AND THE RUNNING BACK SHOULD HAVE THE SMARTS TO GO OFF OF HIS BUTT
HOPEFULLY THOSE OF YOU OUT THERE THAT DO OWN PAINTBALL MARKERS DON'T RUN AROUND ON THE STREETS SHOOTING OTHER PEOPLE'S CARS CAUSE THAT WILL LAND YOU IN JAIL
WE'RE GOING TO RUN HIM FROM SIDE TO SIDE WE'RE GOING TO RUN HIM OFF SOME SCREENS ALLOW HIM TO COME UP IN THE HIGH POST AREA AND SHOOT AS WELL
IF YOU CAN'T GET IT IN TO THIS GUY RUN THE BASE LINE GET IT IN TO THIS GUY ALRIGHT
TAKE YOUR TIME RUN THE PRESS BREAK GET A LAY UP GET READY TO PLAY DEFENSE
WE HAVE DONE CONE ELEVEN AND THEY HAVE BEEN GOOD FIRING BUT REALLY THE RED WOULD RUN WHEN IT GETS TO HOT AND SOME OF THE OTHER GLAZES JUST IT IS JUST TO HOT FOR SOME GLAZES
SO YOU GO THREE AND FOUR WE STEP FIVE SIX WE RUN SEVEN AND EIGHT
A DIGITAL THERMOMETER IS GOING TO COST YOU A BIT MORE HOWEVER THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT DIGITAL THERMOMETERS IS BASICALLY WHAT IT IS THIS IS GOING TO GO ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE AQUARIUM AND THEN IT'S GOT THESE PROBES THAT YOU RUN INTO THE AQUARIUM
THE PERSON HERE DOES NOT LIKE THESE BIG UGLY KNOTS AND WE WERE GOING TO CHOP THEM OFF HERE BUT ON SECOND THOUGHT WE CAN CHOP THE SIX BY SIX OFF HERE AND WE RE GOING TO RUN THE RAILING STRAIGHT ACROSS THE TOPS OF THESE AND WERE GOING TO REPLACE ALL THE RAILING BECAUSE ALL THE RAILING IS JUST ALL SHOT
ONCE WE GET THESE CHOPPED OFF WE CAN RUN OUR TOPS TWO BY SIX RAIL ALL THE WAY ALONG MAKE IT ALL NICE AND STRAIGHT NICE AND EVEN
IT'S VERY UNCOMFORTABLE THE HORSE'S LEG WOULD BE LIKE THIS SAY THIS WAS TO TURN AROUND AND THEY'D BE TRYING TO RUN WITH THAT AGAINST THEM
WHEN YOU RUN YOU'LL NOTICE THAT WHEN I GO TO WORK MY HORSE IN A FEW MINUTES
WE WILL ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT THE VARIOUS PROBLEMS THAT YOU RUN INTO IN USING THESE TOOLS COMMON TECHNIQUE ERRORS THAT BEGINNERS MAKE AND TO MENTION TO YOU WHAT IT IS THAT YOU ARE DOING THAT IS CAUSING THIS SO IN YOUR PRACTICE YOU CAN GO BACK AND IMPROVE YOUR TECHNIQUE TO PRODUCE A MORE SMOOTHER AND HIGHER QUALITY WORK THAT REQUIRES LESS SANDING AND FINISHING
WHEN I'M CLEANING THE CHICKEN I USUALLY HAVE THE WATER RUNNING A LITTLE BIT AND RUN IT UNDER THE WATER
DOING THOSE TWO EXERCISES WILL HELP INCREASE YOUR SPEED AND YOUR POWER AND IT WILL DEFINITELY MAKE YOU RUN FASTER
OKAY NOW THAT'S THE RISK YOU ALWAYS RUN IS TINNING A BALL IF YOU GO FOR A WINNER
IN THIS SECTION I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE PACE YOU SHOULD BE AT IN THE BEGINNING OF YOUR RUN FOR COMPETITIVE CROSS COUNTRY RUNNING
IF YOU HAVE GOT AN UNDERSIZED CORNERBACK THEN YOU CAN'T USE BUMP AND RUN COVERAGE BECAUSE HE IS GOING TO GET ABUSED
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS SOMETIMES WE ARE GOING TO HAVE OUR CORNERBACKS PLAYING IN A SITUATION WE CALL BUMP AND RUN COVERAGE
THAT IS WHERE WE GET BUMP AND RUN COVERAGE FROM
ONE WAY IS IF YOU HAVE A CORNERBACK LIKE THIS ONE THAT IS BIG AND STRONG AND CAN KEEP THIS GUY FROM GETTING IN THE PLAY THEN WE CAN PLAY BUMP AND RUN COVERAGE
NOW THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS THAT YOU CAN DO BUMP AND RUN COVERAGE
SO THE MORNING OF YOUR MARATHON YOU'RE EXCITED YOU'RE READY TO GO YOU'RE READY TO RUN BUT YOU'RE WONDERING SHOULD YOU EAT SOMETHING
WE'LL TALK ABOUT VENDORS HOW TO FIND VENDORS HOW TO BRING VENDORS IN AND WHAT MAKES A SUCCESSFUL CONVENTION RUN
AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TOURS ARE RUN WITH INBOUND TOUR OPERATORS OUTBOUND TOUR OPERATORS RECEPTORS SERVICES DMC'S YOU DON'T KNOW HOW ALL THAT'S RUN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM TRYING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION CORRECTLY BECAUSE WE ARE NOT A HOST
IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE GETTING IT IN IF YOU DIDN'T USE A THICK ENOUGH CORRUGATED PAPER YOU CAN TWIST THE STICK BACK AND FORTH AND IT WILL SLIDE IN OR YOU CAN JUST PRESS IT DOWN ONTO A HARD SURFACE BECAUSE THE STICK SHOULD FIT RIGHT INTO RUN ALONG THE LINES OF THE CORRUGATED PAPER
THEN I WOULD GET HERE TO WORK AND ESSENTIALLY I'M A MANAGER OF SCIENTIFIC PERSONNEL NOW AS I RUN A LAB
IF YOU'VE EVER EMBARKED UPON A PROFESSIONALLY RUN WEIGHT LOSS OR EXERCISE PROGRAM IT'S MOST LIKELY THE FIRST THING THAT YOU WERE TOLD YOU NEEDED TO GET WAS A HEART RATE MONITOR
ALSO I RUN MY OWN BUSINESS AND I USE THE COMPUTER QUITE OFTEN TO RUN INVOICES KEEP TRACK OF SCHEDULES KEEP TRACK OF INVENTORY WHEN I NEED TO ORDER SUPPLIES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE
TAKE IT AND I'LL RUN IT THROUGH
AND RUN MY LOOP THROUGH ONCE AND RUN IT THROUGH AGAIN
RUN IT THROUGH TWICE
NOW WHAT THAT MEANS TO YOU IS YOU DON'T WANT HIM TO RUN WHEN THERE'S A LINE DRIVE HIT
WITH UNION WORK WHAT YOU DO IS YOU GET HEALTH AND PENSION BENEFITS AND YOU GET GUARANTEED AMOUNTS FOR THE RUN OF A SHOW OR YOU GET RESIDUALS OR YOU GET A BUY OUT BUT THOSE RATES ARE SET AND THEY'RE STANDARD AND THE REASON WHY WE HAVE THAT IS TO SAFEGUARD US AGAINST NOT BEING EXPLOITED I GUESS
AND THEN YOU RUN YOUR CREDENTIALS
YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING ENOUGH POWER OUT OF YOUR RUN AND YOUR ROUND OFF TO GET A NICE SET JUST OUT OF YOUR ROUND OFF
SO I'LL GO THROUGH HERE AND FIND ALL OF THE RACES THAT I WANT TO RUN AND WHAT I'LL DO IS I'LL BE PUTTING THESE DATES DOWN ON MY CALENDAR TO LET ME KNOW THAT THAT'S THE DAY THAT I NEED TO REGISTER
YOU CONTINUE UNTIL YOU'VE RUN OUT OF CARDS AND THEN YOU WIN AND THAT'S HOW YOU PLAY SKIP-BO
ORIGINALLY YOU START WITH NO CARDS SO YOU CAN HAVE UP TO FOUR OPEN AND AFTER THE FOURTH ONE YOU START PLACING YOUR DISCARDS ON TOP OF OTHER CARDS BUT THE ONLY CARDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR PLAY ARE THE ONES WHOSE FACE IS UP SO YOU CONTINUE IN THIS MANNER AND ANYONE CAN PLAY ONTO THE CENTER STOCKPILE CARDS AND YOU PLAY UP UNTIL TWELVE AND THEN YOU REMOVE IT AND YOU KEEP GOING UNTIL SOMEONE HAS RUN OUT OF THEIR STOCKPILE SO EVEN THOUGH YOU WANT TO USE YOUR DISCARD PILES REALLY THE STRATEGY IS TO GET RID OF YOUR STOCKPILE CARD THE MOST
NOW REMEMBER ONCE YOU GET PAST FIVE YARDS YOU CAN NO LONGER MAKE CONTACT WITH THAT GUY YOU HAVE JUST GOT TO RUN WITH HIM
BUT THESE RUN ABOUT FORTY-FIVE DOLLARS
NOW A LOT OF DOGS ARE A LITTLE BIT THREATENED BY THE CONCEPT OF A DOGGY DOOR BECAUSE ON FIRST GLANCE IT LOOKS LIKE JUST ANOTHER PART OF THE WALL AND SO TO TEACH YOUR DOG TO RUN INTO THAT PART OF THE WALL AND GO THROUGH CAN BE A LITTLE BIT DAUNTING AND SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS SET YOURSELF UP AND SET YOUR DOG UP FOR SUCCESS
WE'RE GOING TO START OFF WITH AND THIS GUY SHOULDN'T RUN YOU ANY MORE THAN FIVE OR SIX BUCKS
PERHAPS YOUR BEST PINCH HITTER IS ACTUALLY AN OUTFIELDER BUT YOU'RE GOING TO PINCH-HIT HIM FOR YOUR SECOND BASEMAN BECAUSE YOU NEED THE OFFENSE TO SCORE A RUN LATE IN THE GAME
A HORSE THAT GETS USED TO THIS KNOWS IT'S THERE AND BAILEY WILL JUST KIND OF RUN AND KEEP HIS HEAD A LITTLE LOWER
SO I AS SOON AS THEY KNOW IT'S THERE I GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT OFF WHEN I'M WORKING THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THEN JUST GO BACK TO USING IT WHEN I RUN THEM
I DON'T THEM IN THIS ALL THE TIME I ONLY RUN THEM IN IT
ROLLING PINS WORK TO ACTUALLY RUN OVER THE PAPER WHAT IT CAN DO IS CREATE CREASES IN THE PAPER
THAT OCTAVING TRICK IS A COOL WAY TO RUN LINES INSTEAD OF JUST LIKE RUNNING A MELODY ON ONE STRING
IN THE NEXT SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IRON MAIDEN'S RUN TO THE HILLS
WE'RE ON THE SIXTH COUNT OF EIGHT COUNTS FIVE SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT AND WE HAVE A JUMP AND RUN
IF YOU RUN OUT OF CARDS AND YOU MANAGE TO DO SUCCESSFUL STOCKPILES WITH THEM AND YOUR LAST TURN YOU ALREADY PLAYED ONE YOU CAN DRAW
IF YOU RUN OUT OF DRAW CARDS YOU CAN JUST SHUFFLE IN THE COMPLETED STOCKPILE OF CARDS AND KEEP DRAWING SO YOU MAY PLAY AS LONG AS YOU CAN PLAY ON ONE OF THESE FOUR PILES A SEQUENTIAL NUMBER
NOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS RUN THE LEAD ROPE THROUGH YOUR HANDS SO THAT YOU HAVE A HOLD OF YOUR HORSE AND THEN SLIP THE BLANKET OVER HIS MUZZLE UP OVER HIS EYES AND OVER HIS EARS
RUB THE FABRIC TOGETHER AND IF YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AFTER THIS AND RUN IT IN A REGULAR WASH THE PEROXIDE WILL START TO BREAK DOWN THOSE ORGANIC STAINS AND IN ADDITION TO WINE ANY OTHER STAINS THAT ARE ORGANIC LIKE BLOOD OR OTHER PROTEIN BASED STAINS
WE GOT OUR FELTS STAGGERED BUFF THEM UP TO THE DRUM AND RUN THEM THROUGH JUST A LITTLE JUST SO THEY'RE HANGING IN THERE AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO COME BACK OUT
BEING ABLE TO PLAY A NINETY MINUTE SOCCER GAME IS REALLY GOING TO HELP YOU OUT IN THE LONG RUN
HE DOESN'T RUN AROUND AND HE DOESN'T MAKE MANY MISTAKES
THE FIRST THING WE'LL BE DOING IS TAKING THIS PLYWOOD OFF THESE WALLS INSULATING FRAMING THEN WE'RE GOING TO RUN OUR NEW ELECTRICAL WE'RE GOING TO RUN PLUGS HERE HERE A ONE TEN AND A TWO TWENTY
BUT REALLY IF YOU DO IT ON A BASIS OR IF YOU CONSUME IT ON A SMART LEVEL YOU'RE NOT REALLY GOING TO RUN INTO ANY POTENTIAL PROBLEMS
YOU DON'T WANT TO RUN OVER A PIN AND BREAK OUR NEEDLE
WE ARE KEEPING THE LOOPS IN FORMATION BY PINCHING MY OTHER HAND NOW AND I AM GOING TO TAKE THIS TAB END OR THE SHORT END AND WE WILL GO FROM THE OUTSIDE IN AND WE ARE GOING TO RUN THAT THING THROUGH THE LOOP AND KIND OF GET THAT LOOP THE SAME SIZE AS THE OTHER LOOPS AND JUST KIND OF PULL EVERYTHING RIGHT ON DOWN JUST LIKE THAT
AND THEN WHAT YOU CAN DO IS YOU CAN MAKE YOUR LITTLE SLABS THAT SHOW YOUR STAMPS SO THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO TO DECORATE YOUR SLAB WHAT IT'S GOING TO COME OUT LOOKING LIKE IN THE LONG RUN
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE FISHING BLIND AND RUN INTO A SCHOOL OF FISH SAY THAT ARE TEN FEET BELOW THE ICE
SO DON'T RUN YOUR SEAT TO HIGH TRY TO RECORD OR REMEMBER WHAT YOUR MEASUREMENTS ARE ENCASE YOU HAVE TO MESS WITH THINGS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR SEAT NICE AND LEVEL AND GET OUT THERE AND HAVE A GOOD RIDE
SO JUST REAL QUICK RUN THROUGH A ONE YOU JUST HAND ACROSS HAND TO HAND
SO YOU HAVE THE RACKET SO THEY'VE HIT THIS GREAT SHOT AND YOU'RE VIRTUALLY AT A DEAD RUN AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME IN AND YOU PUT THE RACKET OUT AND YOU GET RIGHT UNDERNEATH IT
THE BUTTER IS INSIDE THEN WE TAKE IT AND LET IT RUN UNTIL EVERYTHING IS MIXED UP COMPLETELY
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST RUN INTO THE HALF PIPE AND LIKE THINK YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND GET HURT
AND IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER IDEAS LET YOUR IMAGINATION RUN WILD
TYPICALLY IF YOU WANT TO RUN A LAB YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A DOCTORAL DEGREE AND A NUMBER OF YEARS OF POSTDOCTORAL WORK
IF YOU WANT TO RUN A GROUP YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE A DOCTORAL DEGREE PLUS POSTDOCTORAL WORK
SO LET'S RUN THROUGH THAT ONCE AGAIN AND IT'S A VERY FAST ROUTE
SO A LOT OF ACOUSTIC AMPS CAN BE A DUAL PURPOSE FOR ACOUSTIC ELECTRIC INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS BEING ABLE TO RUN A MICROPHONE THROUGH IT
WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO WEAR AND GO OUT ON A RUN WITH MAKE SURE THAT YOU'VE TRIED IT BEFORE
THE BENEFITS OF PILATES ARE THEY RUN THE GAMUT
TO IRON MULTIPLE PLEATS YOUR GOING TO FOLD YOUR PLEAT GET IT FLAT HOLD IT WITH YOUR HAND PUT YOUR IRON DOWN AND RUN ALONG YOUR PLEAT JUST RUN TO THE END
ALRIGHT HERE'S A DRILL YOU CAN RUN
AND IF YOU BROKE THEM UP REALLY GOOD BUT YOU DIDN'T POCKET A BALL AND YOU TURN CONTROL OF THE TABLE OVER TO YOUR OPPONENT ALL YOU'VE DONE IS OPEN EVERYTHING UP SO THAT YOUR OPPONENT HAS AN EASY ROAD TO RUN OUT AND BEAT YOU OFF OR YOUR OWN BREAK
NOW THIS IS THIS IS ENOUGH TO RUN A REASON AT A GOOD RATE AND BUT YOU KNOW ON SOME COMPUTERS YOU MAY HAVE TROUBLE RUNNING YOUR SONGS IF YOU HAVE A LOT GOING ON
YOU WANT THE CUT END OF YOUR MATERIAL TO DROP OFF OF ONE SIDE SO THAT WHEN YOU RUN THE SAW DOWN HERE IT WILL FALL OFF THE SIDE ON TO THE GROUND
IF YOU RUN OUT OF EITHER TEQUILA OR RUM IN MAJORITY OF DRINKS YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SUBSTITUTE ONE FOR THE OTHER
START BY FINDING THE TOP EDGE OF THE SHEET AND JUST RUN YOUR HANDS ALONG THAT SO IT IS ALL CLEAR
THEN FOLD IT IN HALF RUN YOUR HAND ALONG THE EDGE TO THE NEXT CORNER AND WE WOULD FOLD THAT IN HALF
YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TOO MANY BECAUSE YOU RUN THE RISK OF BEING CORNY IF YOU HAVE LOTS OF LITTLE CATCH PHRASES
I'M GOING TO RUN THE STIRRUP BACK STRAP OF THE STIRRUP LEATHER AND YOU ARE GOING TO RUN BOTH STRAPS THROUGH THE MIDDLE
SO TO RUN THE STIRRUPS UP I'M ONCE AGAIN GOING TO PUT MY LEFT ARM THROUGH THE REIN
ONCE YOU HAVE DISMOUNTED IT IS IMPORTANT TO RUN YOUR STIRRUPS BACK UP
IT'S JUST THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU RUN INTO TO DO IN A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT KIND OF WORK
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO LINE THE DOG UP FROM THE PREVIOUS AND POST OBSTACLES TO ENSURE THEY HAVE A CLEAR RUN THROUGH
IT'S A GOOD DRILL LEARN IT RUN IT
THE FACT IS THIS IS A FOUR PERSON GAME WE CAN'T RUN OUT OF CARDS BECAUSE IT'S FIVE TO EACH FOR THE DEAL THAT'S TWENTY CARDS AND THEN A MAXIMUM OF FOUR EACH FOR THE DRAW THAT'S THIRTY-SIX
THEN WE HAVE THE DRAWSTRING WHICH IS ONE LONG PIECE BUT WHEN I'M READY TO INSERT IT INTO THE BAG I CUT IT IN HALF AND I RUN ONE PIECE AROUND THIS SIDE TO THE HOLE THEN THIS ONE GOES AROUND THE OTHER SIDE SO THE IDEA IS WHEN I OPEN IT THIS IS THE WAY IT CLOSES IT IT PULLS EACH SIDE AGAINST THE OTHER AND CLOSES IT
AGAIN IF YOUR ACRYLIC IS TOO WET IT WILL RUN AND DRIP AND YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF AND START OVER
YOU CAN SEE HOW QUICK I CAN RUN MY FINGERS
YOU CAN RUN THIS THROUGHOUT THE HAIR AS YOU'RE PREPARING TO BRAID AND IT'S ALSO GOOD FOR AFTERWARDS
SAME THING IF I RUN OUT OF HOT DOGS I STILL HAVE HOT DOG BUNS THROW THOSE IN THE FREEZER TOO BECAUSE YOU JUST YOU KNOW SAVE UP THE BREAD THAT WAY YOU'RE NOT HAVING TO YOU'RE NOT MAKING FOURTEEN DIFFERENT BATCHES OF BREAD OR YOU'RE NOT GOING AND BUYING ALL THESE DIFFERENT BREADS YOU CAN JUST USE UP WHAT YOU HAVE
SO YOU CAN JUST LIKE RUN OVER UNDERNEATH IT AND PICK IT BACK UP
SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING CLEAN AND DRY TO WORK WITH AND HAVE AN AMPLE SUPPLY OF EXTRA PAPER TOWELS SO THAT IF YOU SHOULD RUN THROUGH THEM ALL YOU HAVE EXTRAS TO USE AND YOU CAN JUST THROW AWAY WHAT YOU ARE WORKING WITH
AT FORTY TO FIFTY METERS YOU HAVE A CYCLING MOTION AND THIS IS TO LIKE I SAID TO HELP YOU RUN EFFICIENTLY BUT AT THE SAME TIME THIS IS A POWER EVENT
BUT IF YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE A LONG RUN OR YOUR OPPONENT EXCELLENTLY WELL EXECUTED SHOT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO WHAT I CALL SOMEWHAT OF A FENCING SHOT
THIS IS A POWER RACE SO YOU WANT TO RUN WITH PURE POWER SPEED
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'LL RUN INTO WHEN YOU PRINT ON CANVAS IS THE PIECE THAT YOU RECEIVE WILL NOT BE A FINISHED PIECE UNLIKE PAPER THAT YOU PRETTY MUCH CAN PUT IN A LITTLE ENVELOPE AND SELL
SO ONCE YOU CAN MAINTAIN FOR 300 METERS AND YOU COME OFF THE CURB INTO 100 METERS YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO RUN RELAXED WHICH I MEAN WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS RUNNING RELAXED HELPS YOU RUN FASTER
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO THEY NEED THE ENDURANCE TRAINING BUT THEY CAN'T RUN CAUSE THEY HAVE JOINT ISSUES OR WHATEVER
IT S COME OUT A THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH TO AN INCH EVERYTHING IS OUT OF PLUM HERE AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE AND CUT THESE POSTS OFF TO RUN THE RAILING ALONG HERE
SO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS TO RUN AN I-BOLT OVER HERE INTO THE HOUSE AND THE SOLE PLATE COME ALONG AND JUST PULL THIS POST HERE OVER LEVEL SO THAT OUR RAILING HAS A STRAIGHT SHOT AND LOOKS WELL HERE
I'M GOING TO TAKE AND RUN MY PRESSURE WASHER AND CLEAN IT UP ALL REAL GOOD AND GET OFF ALL THE DIRT AND LOSE DEBRIS AND THAN I'M GOING TO TAKE AND SPRAY AND PAT ON TWO COATS OF A SOLID STAIN
IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD TYPICALLY SEE IN A DEALERSHIP YOU CAN HOWEVER RUN INTO A CAR THAT HAS BEEN DESTROYED THERE AND THEN PUT BACK TOGETHER WHEN YOU ARE OUT THERE BUYING FROM A PRIVATE PARTY SO BE SURE THAT YOU REMEMBER SALVAGE TITLES ARE NOT THE KIND OF CAR THAT YOU WANT TO OWN
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY SO IN THE LONG RUN BE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ASKED THAT QUESTION WHEN BUYING A USED CAR
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PROBLEMS THAT YOU MAY END UP WITH IN THE FUTURE AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST THAT YOU RUN AWAY FROM
NOW YOU CAN HIT RANDOMIZEAND IT WILL JUST YOU KNOW RUN THROUGH HERE AND RANDOMIZE THE PATTERN JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR YOU
THAT MEANS WE'LL TAKE OUR LINEBACKERS AND PUT THEM ON AN ALL OUT RUN THROUGH THE LINE TO TRY TO STOP THE PLAY IN THE BACKFIELD WITH THE RUNNING BACK OR TO TRY TO GET TO A QUARTERBACK
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT USING LAEADERBOARD TOURNAMENT SYSTEMS TO HELP RUN YOUR EVENT
I'M JUST GOING TO RUN IT DOWN WITH THE GUN AND THEN TIGHTEN IT WITH A HALF INCH RATCHET
THERE'S A SYSTEM THAT BEARINGS RUN ON
SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS NOT GO AND RUN OFF ON A TANGENT WITH THAT INITIAL PERCEPTION WITHOUT ASKING THE OTHER PERSON POINT BLANK IF THAT PERCEPTION IS TRUE
YOU WANT TO STIR IT UP PUT A LITTLE MORE WATER ON IT AND YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE AND RUN YOUR HAND ACROSS THE TOP OF THE FIRE TO MAKE SURE ALL THE COALS HAVE COOLED OFF
OTHER THAN THAT YOU CAN CHECK THE HARD DISK SIZE AND YOU CAN CHECK THE SPEED OF THAT IT BOOTS UP AND HOW IT SEEMS TO RUN
DOES IT SEEM TO RUN AT AN ACCEPTABLE SPEED TO YOU
ANOTHER THING I DO IS ACTUALLY RUN MY HANDS UNDER WARM WATER
NOW THE QUARTERBACK WILL TURN AND RUN TO THIS SIDE OF THE FIELD AND TRY TO HELP OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLAY
OUR QUARTERBACK RUNS JUST LIKE HE WOULD IN A NORMAL HAND OFF PLAY EXCEPT ONCE HE HANDS THE BALL OFF HE HAS TO ALSO TURN AND RUN TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FIELD SO HE CAN GO DOWN FIELD AND BECOME A BLOCKER AS WELL
ALRIGHT I HAVE ALREADY RUN MY RIBBON OUT TO BOTH SIDES I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO TIE THE KNOT AT THE TOP
AND IT'S ALSO UP A LITTLE BIT FROM THE PAPER SO THAT IF YOU'RE LINING WITH INK YOU'RE NOT GOING TO RUN THE RISK OF SMUDGING QUITE AS READILY
THAT'LL BE QUITE NICE FOR HER SHE CAN CONTROL HER LIGHTING AND I THINK HE'S GETTING A PLASMA SO WE'LL WIRE FOR HIM THERE AND THEN WHERE THE CAMERA IS SITTING WE'RE GOING TO BUMP THIS WALL OUT WHERE IT'S RIGHT NOW A GARAGE DOOR AND WE'LL HAVE THREE WINDOWS THAT SHOULD BUMP OUT ABOUT THREE FEET LARGE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE HIS DESK HIS CHAIR HIS PRINTER AND OF COURSE WE'LL RUN ELECTRICAL OVER THERE BUT THAT SHOULD BE A PRETTY TERRIFIC USE OF THAT SPACE AND THAT'S ACTUALLY AN ADDITION TO THE ROOM SO WE'RE PROBABLY GAINING ABOUT A THREE BY MAYBE TEN ARE THIRTY SQUARE FEET EXTRA FROM THIS LITTLE RENOVATION
THEY HAVE BRIGHT YELLOW BODIES WITH BRIGHT LITTLE LINES THAT START AT THE NOSE AND RUN ALONG THE BACK OFTEN BREAKING INTO SPOTS INSTEAD OF A CONTINUOUS LINE
TO START YOU TAKE THE LARGER LINE AND CREATE A LOOP AND THEN YOU TAKE THE SMALLER LINE AND RUN IT THROUGH THIS WAY AWAY FROM THIS END OF THE LOOP
SO THE WASHINGTON STATE PROGRAM IS RUN THROUGH THE WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY COOPERATIVE EXTENSION
WE ARE GOING TO START THE ENGINE AND LET IT RUN FOR ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY SECONDS
SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS GO AHEAD AND REMOVE THE TAPE SINCE WE KNOW THERE IS OIL IN THE ENGINE AGAIN AND WE ARE GOING TO START THE VEHICLE AND LET IT RUN MAYBE TWENTY OR THIRTY SECONDS IS ENOUGH TIME AND ALLOW THE OIL FILTER TO FILL UP COMPLETELY WITH OIL
LAY YOU ACETATE OVER TOP TAKE A PIECE OF PACKING TAPE RUN IT DOWN THE SIDE OVER HERE AND MAKE SURE IT'S NICE AND SMOOTH
SO I ALREADY TURNED THIS UNDER A QUARTER OF AN INCH TO BIND THE SEAM AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NOW IS RUN A SEAM ALL THE WAY AROUND JUST RIGHT ON TOP OF IT TO CLOSE IT
THE ENDS HAVE BEEN CUT OFF AND VERY SMALL STONES HAVE BEEN PLACED IN HERE SO WHEN YOU CAP IT BACK ON AS YOU TILT THE RAIN STICK THE SMALL STONES RUN INTO THE TINES OF THE CACTUS ON THE INSIDE CREATING THE SOUND THAT YOU HEAR
JUST MARK FIVE AND I LIKE TO RUN A LITTLE PIECE OF CHALK HERE AND YOU DO ALL SIDES ON BOTH LEGS
WHEN YOU ARE CIRCUIT BENDING SOMETHING THAT'S LOW VOLTAGE YOU WON'T GET A SHOCK I DON'T KNOW MAYBE SOMETHINGS THAT RUN OFF OF A LOT BATTERIES AND MAYBE HAVE SOME BIG CAPACITORS IN THEM YOU MIGHT GET A LITTLE TINGLE OR SOMETHING BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN SHOCKED BY ANYTHING AND IT KIND OF MAKES SENSE BECAUSE I MEAN THEY JUST RUN ON SUCH LOW VOLTAGE THERE'S JUST LITTLE AA BATTERIES IN THEM AND SO
ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS ON BEING MENTALLY PREPARED FOR A RUN
FLOUR USUALLY DOES NOT DISSOLVE COMPLETELY SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT AND RUN IT THROUGH THE SCREEN BECAUSE YOU NEED THE BATTER TO FLOW
YOU WANT TO START SLOW WARMING UP YOUR BODY WARMING EVERYTHING UP TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T RUN INTO ANY INJURIES
FOR EXAMPLE IF WE HAD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MELD WE HAD A DOUBLE RUN IN A SUIT THAT'S A POWERFUL HAND NOW WE HAVE LOTS OF ROOM BECAUSE ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS MAKE OUR TWENTY MELD THAT'S THE BASIC REQUIREMENT WE SAVE OUR TWENTY MELD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY POINTS IS GOING TO PICK UP AN AWFUL LOT OF ROOM FOR ERROR IS WE FALL SHORT ON COUNTERS THAT IS THAT IF WE DON'T HAVE MORE THAN IF WE HAVE THE MINIMUM COUNTERS THAT'S FINE
THIS IS CREATURE SPECIFIC FOR COLOR WHICH MEANS YOU WOULD PUT THIS IN YOUR SIDEBOARD TO YOUR MAIN DECK AND IF YOU RUN ACROSS SOMEONE WHO IS RUNNING HEAVY GREEN OR WHITE CREATURES THEN YOU WOULD PLACE THIS CARD IN THERE AND BASICALLY YOU'RE GETTING A FREE TEAR BECAUSE TEAR COST YOU ONE AND A BLACK AND THIS ONLY COST YOU A BLACK TO DESTROY TARGET GREEN OR WHITE CREATURE
NOW WE ARE GOING TO RUN THROUGH WITH SOME CHORDS AND DO SOME IMPROVISING SO I'M JUST GOING TO PLAY BASIC BLACK CHORDS
I'M GOING TO PLAN A TWENTY MINUTE RUN
YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO GO ON EITHER SIDE OF IT AND AS YOU RUN YOUR FINGERS UP AND DOWN ON EITHER SIDE YOU'LL FEEL THEM SORT OF SINK INTO THIS VALLEY
THERE THEY GO TRYING TO GET AWAY SO I NEED TO LASH THEM BEFORE THEY RUN OFF MY TABLE
I'VE ALSO HAD MY CLIENTS TELL ME THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED SOMETHING SIMILAR WHERE THEY MIGHT BE SO FOCUSED ON THEIR RACE AND MAYBE NOT EVEN IN THE RACE IT CAN BE EVEN WHEN YOU ARE DOING LIKE TRAINING OR SPEED WORK ON THE TRACK OR THEY ARE GOING OUT FOR A LONG TRAINING RUN AND THEY EXPERIENCE A RUNNER'S KIND OF HIGH
YOU ALSO GOT A JUMPING SIDE KICK WHICH IS EASIER TO RUN AND ACTUALLY LEAP INTO SOMETHING
RECAP YOUR PEN SO IT DOESN'T RUN OUT OF INK OR DRY UP
SO WORK ON YOUR LOB SERVE RETURN WITH A PRACTICE PARTNER SO YOU'LL GET TO WORK ON YOUR SERVE AND THE RETURN AND IT WILL REALLY HELP YOU IN THE LONG RUN
IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT THE CENTER OF YOUR VEHICLE'S TIRE AND GO UP APPROXIMATELY A FOOT AND A HALF YOU ARE GOING TO RUN INTO WHERE THE STRUT MOUNT IS LOCATED
ENDORPHINS ARE LIKE WHAT I WOULD CALL THE RUNNER'S HIGH I KNOW IN MY SPRINTS AND RUNNING MARATHONS I'VE RUN NEARLY THIRTY FIVE MARATHONS IN DIFFERENT TIMES
THE MORE YOU RUN RELAXED THE MORE YOU CAN RUN FASTER
AND LIKE I SAID THIS PLACE HAS PSYCHOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE OVER MOST RUNNERS BECAUSE THE HOMESTRETCH IS WHERE MOST RUNNERS OR MOST ATHLETES BREAK DOWN START TO GET TIGHTENED UP THEIR MUSCLES STARTS CRAMPING SO IF YOU CAN MAINTAIN ON THE HOMESTRETCH YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH RUN A GOOD RACE
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO RUN A 400-METER SPRINT
AT THIS POINT YOU CAN EITHER FOLD IT UP LIKE THIS CREASE IT AND CUT ALONG THAT CREASE OR TAKE A PENCIL AND JUST RUN IT ALONG THE EDGE OF THE PAPER LIKE THAT
THE ENGINE WON'T RUN AS HOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT SUCKING IN AIR FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND IT'LL RUN A LOT BETTER
HE HAD ALL AROUND THE BIKE'S IN GOOD SHAPE AND IT'S GOING TO RUN A LOT BETTER NOW WITH THESE NEW SEALS IN IT
IT'LL DO IT'S LITTLE RUN THROUGH
THERE JUST HERE TO HELP KEEP THE BLANKET FROM GETTING TOO SHIFTED DURING HIS MOVEMENT AND RUN AROUND
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS JUST TAKE IT TAKE MY INITIAL LOOP AND JUST RUN IT THROUGH THE RING
ANOTHER NICE THING OF COURSE IS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO WEAR WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO RUN AND BIKE IN UNDERNEATH THE WET SUIT AND THEN JUST PEEL IT OFF AND BE READY TO GO
YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO RUN AROUND SO WHEN YOU ARE JUGGLING YOU WANT TO STAND WITH YOUR FEET STRAIGHT TOGETHER
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS IF YOU TRY TO RUN THE SAME TYPE OF WOOFERS YOU'LL BE RUNNING WITH THIS AMPLIFIER OR THAT AMPLIFIER THERE WILL BE A BIG DIFFERENCE VOLUME WISE SOUND WISE QUALITY WISE AND DISTORTION WISE
THIS SMALL AMPLIFIER RUN TWO WOOFERS THAT COULD BE TWELVE HUNDRED WATTS ALTOGETHER
WE RUN DOWN TO THE STORE AND GET ALL TYPES OF CHEMICALS THAT WILL KILL THE BROAD LEAVES
MY NAME IS SHAWN CONNOLLY AND I LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA AND I RUN A SKATEBOARD PROGRAM CALLED SF SKATE CLUB AND YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE AT SFSKATECLUB.COM
MY NAME IS SHAWN CONNELLY AND I LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA AND I'M SPONSORED AND I ALSO RUN A SKATEBOARD PROGRAM FOR KIDS CALLED THE SF SKATE CLUB
LAYMAN'S TERMS THIS MEANS THAT YOUR EFFECT MONSTERS WHO RUN YOUR DIFFERENT DIMENSION DECK ARE INEFFECTIVE -THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING THEY JUST KIND OF STALL
SAY YOU'RE WORKING IN A BAR AND YOU RUN OUT OF VODKA AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT OF VODKA THAT NIGHT
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO UNDO THIS AND I'LL JUST RUN ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS OF RUNNING A PRUSIK KNOT
SO WHENEVER THEY RUN THAT THROUGH THEIR THEIR THEIR PLANT CHIPPER THEY ACTUALLY MAKE A BARK MULCH THAT CAN BE USED IN THE GARDENS
SO ONCE THIS IS SET FOR TEN MINUTES THEN WE'LL SIMPLY POUR THE BOILING WATER DOWN AND THEN AFTER WE'VE DONE ALL THAT THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO JUST RUN THE HOT TAP WATER AND RUN THIS FOR ABOUT THREE TO FIVE MINUTES JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE HAD TIME TO CLEAR EVERYTHING OUT
SO WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE THE SHARP EDGE AND WE RUN THIS AT AN ANGLE AROUND THE WHOLE PIPE
ALICE MONSAERT THIS STABILITY BALL EXERCISE IS GOING TO TARGET THE OBLIQUES WHICH RUN ON THE SIDE OF THE WAIST
IF YOU ELIMINATE EVERYBODY THE OTHER TEAM WINS IF YOU DON'T IT'LL BE TIED UP OR TIME WILL RUN OUT
I DON'T HAVE IT TOO LOUD RIGHT NOW BUT YOU CAN GET A LOT MORE AMPLIFICATION IF YOU JUST RUN IT THROUGH A SIMPLE AUDIO JACK AND OUT THROUGH YOUR GUITAR AMPLIFIER OR YOUR STEREO OR YOUR RECORDING STUDIO YOUR MIXING BOARD OR WHATEVER IT IS
MOST OF THEM RUN IN THE $50 TO $80 RANGE AS OPPOSED TO $1 500 OR UP FOR A SET OF BAGPIPES
WHEN WE DO WE'RE GOING TO CHECK THE BACK TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO BLACK LINE IF THERE IS JUST GO AHEAD AND RUN YOUR FINGER DOWN AND REMOVE IT
WHEN HE PULLS WE DON'T WANT THIS GUARD TO BE IN THE BACKFIELD BECAUSE WE MAY BE BRINGING A RUN RIGHT AHEAD OF HIM
ONCE HE GETS ON THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE HE'S GOING TO RUN A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE RIGHT DOWN THE LINE AND HE'LL HIT THE FIRST THING HE SEES IN THE OPPOSITE JERSEY
HE HAS TO RUN OVER ANYBODY IN HIS PATH WHEN HE PULLS OUT
IF YOU HAPPEN TO RUN INTO ANYONE LIKE THAT
NOW WHAT HE'S GOT ON HIS HANDS NOW IS HE'S GOT POSSIBLY A RUN OR A PLAY THAT'S GOING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD OR COMING UP THE MIDDLE SO HE'S GOING TO IGNORE ME AS THE QUARTERBACK
SOME OFFENSES RUN A THREE GUARD SET SO INSTEAD OF HAVING A SMALL FORWARD THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER GUARD
YOU RUN IN YOU MAKE THE BIRTHDAY CHILD THE HERO
NOW AT THIS POINT IF I WERE JUST GOING TO RUN BACK ON THE FIELD THIS BARREL IS GOOD TO GO AND THAT'S ALL YOU'D NEED TO DO
HI MY NAME IS MICHAEL QUEBEC AND TODAY'S SUBJECT IS HOW TO STRETCH AFTER A RUN
AFTER A RUN YOU ARE PRETTY WARM AND SO THE RISK OF INJURY FOR STRETCHING ISN'T QUITE AS MUCH BUT IT'S ALWAYS STILL A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE IT SLOW AND EASY
USUALLY YOUR RELAXERS RUN ABOUT ANYWHERE FROM SIXTY FIVE TO EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS IN ORDER TO PUT THE RELAXER ON
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO RUN IT UP AND DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE SPINE YOU'RE GOING TO PLACE IT ACROSS AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BEND YOUR KNEE AND YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE YOUR THIGH BACK AND FORTH OVER THE RIDGES
SO IF YOU RUN SHORT ON YOUR GLASS BECAUSE IT ALLOWED A LOT FOR EVERY PIECE YOU ARE REALLY BUMMED OUT
THEY'RE THE WORST COMBINATION OF CHEAP AND COMPLICATED WHERE YOU CAN WORK ON EM A LONG TIME AND STILL HAVE TROUBLE WITH THEM ONCE THEY'VE RUN FOR YEARS AND GOTTEN BADLY WORN INSIDE
THE NEXT POINT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS STOMACH 36 OR THREE MILE RUN
YOU'RE GOING TO RUN YOUR FINGERS DOWN FIND THAT HOLLOW SPACE
AND THAT IS HOW YOU RUN BASIC VOLLEYBALL DRILLS
THESE RUN ON A SWISS PRECISION AND NORMALLY THE SMOOTHEST AND THE FASTEST BEARINGS ON THE MARKET
WE WOULD TAKE THE REINS OVER HER HEAD AND WE ARE GOING TO COME AROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE AND RUN THE RIGHT STIRRUP UP
ONE OF THE DRAW BACKS IS IF YOU HAD TO RUN OR YOU KNOW BE PHYSICAL YOU'VE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT IT BUMPING AROUND
AND RUN A NICE CLEAN TOP SEAM ALL THE WAY ACROSS THIS
YOU REALLY WANT TO AT FIRST THINK ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT BECAUSE IF YOUR SMALL BUSINESS TAKES OFF AND YOU'RE NOT REALLY A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS YOU MIGHT RUN INTO SOME LEGAL PROBLEMS DOWN THE ROAD
THE DIFFERENCE IS YOU HAVE TWO LAPS AND MOST RUNNERS LIKE I SAID THEY WOULD WANT TO RUN IN BETWEEN FIFTY AND 55 SECONDS EACH LAP
NORMALLY AROUND 600 METERS OR SO YOU WILL HAVE A RUNNER STARTING TO BREAK DOWN BECAUSE OF THAT LACTIC ACID I EXPLAINED AND THIS IS WHERE YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO RUN EFFICIENTLY AND SMART FOR 800-METER RUNNING
MY NAME IS DARREN STORR AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I WANT TO SHOW YOU GUYS HOW TO RUN 800 METERS SUCCESSFULLY
NOW YOU MAY OR MAY NOT WANT THE OUTSIDE PLAYERS THE FORWARD AND THE SHOOTING GUARD TO MOVE UP A LITTLE BIT THAT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU WANT TO RUN IT
AND THAT IS HOW TO STRETCH AFTER A RUN
THESE ARE GOOD FOR IF IT'S WARM OUT IF YOU ONLY NEED A LITTLE BIT OF FOOD YOU'RE DOING A FIVE HOUR HIKE AND YOU PRETTY MUCH WANT TO RUN THESE ARE REALLY GOOD
THEY HAVE MANY DIFFERENT VENDING OPTIONS ENTRY LEVEL HELMETS WHICH RANGE FROM THE $130 RANGE TO YOUR MORE ADVANCED HELMETS WHICH RUN IN THE $700 RANGE
ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M SHOWING YOU GUYS HOW TO RUN THE FOUR X 100 RELAY
AND I'M JUST GOING TO USE A DRIVER TO RUN THEM DOWN
NOW THE MOST COMMON THING IS ONE OF TWO THINGS EITHER ONCE AGAIN LIKE THE BALLS YOU'RE THROWING THEM TOO FAR OUT AND YOU HAVE TO RUN AFTER THEM OR WHAT'S EVEN MORE COMMON IS YOU'RE GETTING TOO MUCH OF A SPIN ON IT AND IT'S COMING BACK AND IT'S WHACKING YOU ON THE LIP
PRE-WET IT SEE WHERE THE WATER'S GOING TO RUN
SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT GO INTO MAKING A SESSION RUN SMOOTHLY
YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUN THEM NECESSARILY IN RUNNING WATER
MAKE SURE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND THAT THEY HAVE THE PROPER CREDENTIALS AND ONCE YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH THAT HAVE THEM RUN A TEST TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT ALLERGIC TO THE SOLUTION BECAUSE THEY USE THE SAME SOLUTIONS IN PERMING YOUR EYELASHES AS THEY DO YOUR HAIR
