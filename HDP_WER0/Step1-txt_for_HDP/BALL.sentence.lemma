SO WHEN YOU HIT IT TOSS THE BALL IN FRONT OF YOU TAKE YOUR ARM BACK LEAD WITH YOUR ELBOW AND HIT WITH YOUR HAND OPEN AND OUT IN FRONT OF YOU
SO WHEN SERVING WHAT YOU WANT TO IS YOU WANT TO HAVE A BASKET OF BALLS TAKE THE BALL OUT IN FRONT OF YOU TOSS IT UP IN FRONT OF YOU HIGH ENOUGH SO YOU HAVE TIME TO GET TO IT AND HIT IT WITH YOUR HAND
BALL COMES OUT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEY DON'T GET THE FOUL CALLED BECAUSE THE PLAYER THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO BOX OUT IS EASILY ABLE TO GET THE REBOUND
MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH SPACE IN BETWEEN YOURSELF AND THE RIM SO WHEN THE BALL COMES OFF YOU CAN REBOUND IT EASILY
MOST OF THEM ARE EQUIPPED WITH A BALL BEARING TYPE SWIVEL AT THE VERY END SO THAT MAKES THEM A LITTLE BIT FASTER AND THE JUMP ROPE ITSELF DOESN'T GET BALLED UP INSIDE THE HANDLE
YOU'RE KNEELING HANDS GET PLACED ON THE BALL KIND OF LIKE A KARATE CHOP AND WHEN I PUSH THE BALL OUT BENDING AT THE HIPS AND THEN USING THE ELBOWS TO DRIVE THE BALL IN TO THE SIDE AND BACK UP
OK THE NEXT CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SCORING YOUR POINTS OR YOUR BALLS TO MOVE FORWARD TO SINK EVENTUALLY THE EIGHT BALL AND WIN THE GAME
WE KNOW THAT IF YOU MAKE A LEGAL SHOT YOU GET TO SCORE AGAIN AND CONTINUE TO KEEP PLAYING SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A SCENARIO WHERE I'M STRIPES AND THERE'S TWO BALLS AND I'M STILL SHOOTING I COULD SO SOMETHING WHERE I CALL THE TWELVE BALL IN THE CORNER AND TRY TO STOP THE Q BALL HERE BECAUSE AGAIN AS YOU LEARN POOL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN POSITIONING AND AGAIN THIS IS A DIFFERENT VIDEO WE'RE JUST LEARNING ABOUT THE STRATEGY OF THE GAME AND TRYING TO WIN THE GAME BUT I WOULD TRY TO MAKE THE TWELVE THE TEN AND NOW ALL MY BALLS ARE DONE
I'M TRYING TO GET THAT EIGHT BALL BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU WIN YOU HAVE TO MAKE LEGAL SHOTS
OKAY SO THIS IS ABOUT HOW YOU SHOULD BE TURNED WHEN YOU HIT THE BALL
SO THE HIP SHOULDER TURN IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GOING TO HIT THE BALL STRAIGHT TRUE AND FAR
SO YOU WANT TO HAVE YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR BALL SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU CAN GET IT KIND OF QUICK AND IT S NOT GOING TO BOTHER YOU DURING THE POINT
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO BACK PICK UP A BALL AND COME BACK TO YOUR SECOND SERVE
THE SERVER STARTS THE POINT AND YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TWO CHANCES TO PUT THE BALL INSIDE THE SMALL SQUARE ACROSS YOU INSIDE THE SERVICE LINE
AND NUMBER SEVEN IF YOU TURN IT OVER BEFORE THAT CLUB HEAD HITS THE BALL YOU'RE GOING TO HOOK
NUMBER THREE IF YOU GET YOUR HANDS IN FRONT OF THE BALL
NUMBER FOUR IF YOU PLAY THE BALL A LITTLE FURTHER BACK IN YOUR STANCE
NOW WATCH THE BLUE BALL
THEN WHEN YOU ADD THE THIRD BALL YOU HAVE COLUMNS
HERE'S ONLY THE BLUE BALL IS DOING A REVERSE CASCADE
SO IT'S LIKE THROWING A DART THEORETICALLY IF YOU CAN GET THAT BALL TO A NICE LOFT
BUT CONSIDERING YOUR OTHER OPTION IS REALLY A SILICONE JUGGLING BALL THAT RUN ANYWHERE FROM $30 TO $50 DOLLAR A PIECE
ALL RIGHT THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT BOUNCE JUGGLING IS WHAT KIND OF BALL TO USE
ANOTHER THING WE CAN DO IS STANDING BEHIND THE BALL JUST WORKING ON OUR VERTICAL LEAP
AS WELL YOU CAN JUMP OVER THE BALL AND BACK BEHIND THE BALL AND OVER THE BALL AND BEHIND THE BALL
YOU STEP OVER AND JUMPING OVER THE BALL JUST AS IF YOU'RE JUMPING OVER A DEFENDER AS YOU'RE GOING DOWN THE FIELD
O'KAY YOU ARE GOING TO PUSH BACK PRESSING AGAINST THE INFLATED BALL AND THEN RELAXING THE SHOULDERS AND BACK FORWARD
YOU ARE GOING TO PUSH BACK IT IS A VERY SMALL MOVEMENT AND THEN COME FORWARD KEEPING YOUR BACK NICE AND STRAIGHT PUSH BACK GETTING THAT RESISTANCE OF THE BALL BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES AND THEN COME FORWARD
YOU ARE GOING TO PLACE YOUR BALL JUST A LITTLE BIT BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES O'KAY
O'KAY IN THIS CLIP WE ARE GOING TO BE USING AN INFLATABLE BALL TO HELP STRENGTHEN THE LOW BACK
WE WANT TO REMAIN ON THE BALL OF THE FOOT AND NOT FLAT HEEL
AND WHAT THIS ALLOWS TO HAPPEN IS IN A LOT OF CASES WHEN IT'S A RUN BALL HE'S GOING TO BLOW THIS MAN OUT AND THE RUNNING BACK SHOULD HAVE THE SMARTS TO GO OFF OF HIS BUTT
TO START WITH YOUR FEET ARE AT A SHOULDER DISTANCE YOU'RE GOING TO TURN YOUR BODY TO THE RIGHT AS YOU'RE TURNING TO THE RIGHT YOUR RIGHT HEEL TURNS AND YOUR LEFT FOOT TURNS ON THE BALL OF THE FOOT
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS HAVE YOUR HANDS AND YOUR FINGERS SPREAD APART ON THE BALL YOU LEFT HAND GUIDING THE BALL SO IT'S LOOKS LIKE YOU WOULD BE GUIDING YOUR BALL TOWARDS THE BASKET
SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS WHEN YOU LIFT UP YOU BEND UP WITH YOUR LEGS AND YOU MOVE UP WITH THE BALL AND WITH THIS HAND YOU GUIDE IT SO IT DOESN'T GO IN ANY OTHER DIRECTION BESIDE THE ACTION YOU GOING TOWARDS AND YOU MOVE THE BALL UP AND YOU HOLD IT WITH YOUR FINGERS
THIS ALLOWS YOU TO GO AT THE BALL WITH THE RACKET EDGE AND KIND OF BRUSH THE BALL WHEN YOU NEED TO
BALL GOES HERE THIS GUY DRIBBLES IT THIS GUY STAYS BEHIND YOU GET THE DEFENSE TO COMMIT HERE REVERSE THE BALL TO THIS GUY
WE'VE GOT THE BALL TAKING WE'VE GOT THE GUY TAKING THE BALL OUT OF BOUNDS
IT'LL SOAK DOWN INTO THE ROOT BALL DEEP AND SLOW
SO YOU ALSO WANT TO SCORE YOUR CLAY BALL REALLY WELL
NOW REMEMBER YOU'RE GOING TO HIT A LITTLE EXTRA DISTANCE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU DRAW THE BALL
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT A LOT OF BEGINNING PLAYERS DO THAT REALLY IS NOT PROPER IS PUTTING THE CUE BALL TOO FAR BACK WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TOO MUCH DISTANCE TO TRAVEL FROM THAT POINT UP TO THERE
WE DON'T WANT TO USE ANY ENGLISH TO SQUIRT THE CUE BALL OFF ONE SIDE OF THE OTHER
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS BALL COMING UP OFF THE TABLE AND WE WANT IT TO GO STRAIGHT DOWN HERE
WE WANT TO CONTACT THAT BALL FULL AND WE WANT TO HIT IT AS FAST AS WE CAN
BUT THIS IS REALLY GOOD PRACTICE RIGHT HERE BECAUSE NOW WE'RE GOING TO KICK AT THE BALL
SO WE'RE BACK TO IDENTIFYING OUR ANGLE INTO THE CUSHION AND OUT ONCE AGAIN TO HIT THIS BALL
YOU'RE GOING TO OPEN UP THE INSIDE ARM IS OPEN THE BALL'S GOING TO GO IN YOU'RE GOING TO COVER THE BALL WITH BOTH TIPS AND HOLD ON TO IT TIGHT STAYING LOW IN ORDER TO EXPLODE THROUGH THE HOLE
ONCE THE BALL GOES INSIDE HE WANTS TO WRAP THE BALL UP TIGHT AND COVER IT WITH BOTH TIPS OVER THE BALL
BUT THE MAIN THIS IS YOU WANT TO READ YOUR DEFENDER AND FIGURE OUT WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO SHOOT THE BALL AFTER CATCHING IT AND GETTING IT READY
HAVE THE BALL HERE AND HAVE THE QUICKEST RELEASE AS POSSIBLE MEANING DON'T TAKE THE BALL HERE AND THEN DROP IT DOWN HERE TO THROW IT
HAVE THE BALL HERE BOOM QUICK RELEASE
YOU GUYS CAN WATCH JOHN ELWAY HOLDS THE BALL HERE DOESN'T EVEN WIND UP THROWS IT FROM THERE
TWO HANDS ON THE BALL AND YOU WANT TO KEEP THE BALL IDEALLY UP UP AROUND YOUR SHOULDERS
YOU DON'T WANT TO CARRY THE BALL DOWN HERE BECAUSE WHAT THAT DOES IT CAUSES YOU TO HAVE A SLOW RELEASE
THAT MEANS THAT THE PITCHER'S ACTUALLY THROWN THE BALL AND HIT THE BATTER
THIS IS WHEN THE PITCHER THROWS THE BALL WILDLY OUT OF THE CATCHER'S RANGE
SO FIRST OF ALL WHEN THE SHOT GOES UP WE'RE GOING TO NOT LOOK AT THE BALL BUT WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUR MAN
SO IF MY TEAM WERE TO SERVE THE BALL AND WE GET AN IN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE COURT WE GET IT IN THE SQUARE AND ON THE GROUND WE GET A POINT
AND WHEN USING THIS TYPE OF SCORING THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A POINT IS WHEN YOU SERVE THE BALL
THE ONLY WAY IN TRADITIONAL OR SIDE OUT SCORING YOU CAN GET A POINT IS IF YOU SERVE THE BALL
A TENNIS RACKET IS GOING TO GO ALONG WITH YOUR TENNIS BALL SO YOU CAN HIT THE BALL BACK AND FORTH
NOW THE REST OF THE THINGS YOU NEED ARE NOT QUITE AS ESSENTIAL AS YOUR TENNIS BALL AND YOUR TENNIS RACKET
NOW WHEN YOU ARE FIRST TAKING THE BALL OUT YOU WANT TO YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO CROSS THE HALF COURT LINE BEFORE EIGHT TO TEN SECONDS
IT USED TO BE TEN SECONDS IN MY DAY WHEN I PLAYED BUT I HAVE SEEN WHERE THEY HAVE COUNTED EIGHT SO YOU WANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND WHENEVER YOU ARE PLAYING BALL THAT YOU GOT TO CROSS THAT HALF COURT LINE AND YOU CAN NEVER CAN NEVER PASS IT BACK ACROSS THAT LINE ONCE YOU HAVE CROSSED OVER INTO THE OFFENSE THE FRONT COURT
BEFORE WE GET TO THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO STILL WITH ONE BALL AND WE'RE GOING TO CALL THIS THE ONE BALL ARK
SO GET RID OF THOSE TWO BALLS ONCE AGAIN WE STILL JUST NEED ONE BALL TO GET THIS GOING
REALLY YOU CAN INCORPORATE IT INTO A BALL PATTERN BUT YOU CAN BALANCE ANYTHING YOU WANT
SO YOU WANT TO CREATE AS MUCH CLUB HEAD SPEED FOR THOSE HIGH HANDICAP PLAYERS WHO HAVE TROUBLE GETTING THE BALL UP IN THE AIR
THESE HAVE ROTATING CUPS ON BALL JOINTS
THIS IS A SPEED BALL NIB
OKAY NOW THAT'S THE RISK YOU ALWAYS RUN IS TINNING A BALL IF YOU GO FOR A WINNER
NOW WHEN YOU GO IN THE BALL YOU CAN STAY ON YOUR KNEES AND JUST BASICALLY BEND FORWARD ALWAYS THINKING OF A LINE SHINING THROUGH THE CROWN OF THE HEAD
SO PLEASE IF YOU HAVEN'T TRIED THIS MOVE AND JUST HAPPEN TO FIND THIS CLIP ONLINE I WILL HIGHLY SUGGEST THAT YOU CHECK OUT THE OTHER CLIPS ON ARM EXTENSIONS FORWARD EXTENSIONS ON THE BALL TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU MASTER THE MOVES PROPERLY
YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP YOUR HAND ON TOP OF IT YOU'RE GOING TO PULL THE BALL BACK
SO AS YOU'RE GOING TO SEE FROM THESE GUYS THEY'RE GOING TO BE DRIBBLING HARD INTO THE DEFENDER AND ONCE THEY FEEL LIKE THAT THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE DRIBBLE ANYMORE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IS THEY'RE GOING TO DRIBBLE IN AND THEY'RE GOING TO PULL THE BALL BACK
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP THAT SHIELD UP AS YOU'RE PULLING THE BALL BACK BECAUSE IF NOT YOU PULL THE BALL BACK AND YOU LEAVE YOURSELF OPEN AND EXPOSED THE DEFENDER ALL HE HAS TO DO IS STEP THROUGH TAKE THAT BALL AND HE'S GOING TO GO DOWN ON THE OTHER END AND SCORE IT
WHEN YOU DO YOU DRIBBLE YOU KEEP THE BALL IN CLOSE TO YOU AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEAL YOUR DEFENDER AWAY AND KEEP YOUR SHIELD UP
AND THE WAY THAT YOU USE THIS DRIBBLE IS IF YOU'RE DRIBBLING DOWN THE FLOOR AND YOUR DEFENDER IS CLOSING TIGHT ON YOU AND YOU DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE TO CONTINUE FORWARD WHAT YOU CAN DO IS YOU CAN PULL THE BALL BACK AND GET AWAY FROM YOUR DEFENDER
IF YOU WANTED TO CUT THE BALL TO THE LEFT IN A CUTTER FASTBALL YOU'D POSITION YOUR FINGERS ON THE LEFT HALF OF THE BALL TO CREATE SPIN AND MOVEMENT THAT WOULD MAKE THE BALL BASICALLY CURVE TO THE RIGHT
IF YOU WANT TO CUT THE BALL TO THE RIGHT AND YOU'RE A RIGHT HANDED PITCHER YOU WOULD CUT THE BALL IN HALF AND POSITION BOTH FINGERS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BALL
THE CUTTER IS ACCOMPLISHED BY EITHER CUTTING THE BALL TO THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT
YOU WANT PRESSURE ON THE BALL OF THE FOOT
HITTING DRILLS YOU HAVE A SETTER WHO WILL SET THE BALL TO THE HITTER
WHEN PASSING THE BALL YOU WANT TO HIT IT BETWEEN YOUR WRISTS AND YOUR ELBOW
SO THE TOSSER WOULD TOSS THE BALL TO THE PASSER THE PASSER WANTS TO GET BEHIND THE BALL FACE THEIR TARGET USE THEIR KNEES GET THEIR BUTT DOWN
SO I'M RIGHT HANDED SO I'M GOING TO STEP FIRST WITH MY RIGHT FOOT SO I TAKE A TWO STEP APPROACH RIGHT LEFT BEND DOWN PUT MY HANDS BEHIND ME PALMS FACING UP AND THEN ONCE I'M DOWN BRING MY HANDS UP TO BRING ME UP HIGHER ABOVE THE GROUND AND THEN I'M GOING TO DROP MY ELBOW LEAD WITH MY LEFT ARM AND SWING THROUGH THE BALL
SO THAT WAS THE MED BALL CHEST PASS AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO SOME GRIP EXERCISES
ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS EXERCISE IS YOU ARE ACTUALLY CAUSING YOUR INNER THIGHS TO CONTRACT AGAINST THE MEDICINE BALL WHICH IS GOING TO ADD AN EXTRA CHALLENGE AND YOU ARE GOING TO FEEL IT A LITTLE BIT DEEPER IN YOUR ABDOMINALS
OUR NEXT CLIP IS GOING TO BE STABILIZATION CRUNCHES WITH THE MEDICINE BALL
NOW IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HOLDING ON TO THIS BALL YOU CAN ALWAYS TRY TO CROSS YOUR ANKLES BUT I RECOMMEND TRYING TO JUST POSITION YOUR FEET TO HOLD THE MEDICINE BALL
OF COURSE YOU WANT TO GET DOWN NICE AND GENTLY ON THE MAT AND FOLD DOWN NICE AND SLOW AND YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE YOUR MEDICINE BALL AND YOU ARE GOING TO PLACE IT BETWEEN THE THIGHS AND YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP YOUR FEET AT NINETY DEGREES
GRAB YOUR MEDICINE BALL WITH BOTH HANDS
THIS LITTLE ENERGY BALL IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT
THE MAIN THING THAT YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON ARE TWO HANDS ON THE BALL
WHEN WE WERE THROWING OUR BALL UP WITH THE ONE HANDED TOSS WE WERE JUST GOING UP IN THE AIR
YOU CAN'T BE MOVING THAT BALL AROUND
ANYTIME THAT BALL COMES UP OR IS MOVED IF THE OFFICIALS CATCH IT THAT WILL BE CALLED AS AN OFFSIDE S
ONCE YOU GET THAT BALL LOCKED AND READY YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT THERE
HE DEFINITELY CANNOT LIFT THE BALL UP AT ANY POINT ANY TIME
THIS GUY'S DRIBBLING GETS THE BALL TO THE MIDDLE HE NOW SEES THIS GUY COMING PASSES HERE
AND YOU'RE GOING TO DROP THE BALL SLIGHTLY BEHIND THE HEAD TO ABOUT NINETY DEGREES AND EXTEND UP
BALL COMES OFF THE RIM IT'S POSITION FIRST CONTACT FIRST YOU'RE MAKING SURE YOU FEEL THE OTHER GUY FIRST AND THEN YOU GO FOR THE BALL
THERE ARE SOME GORGEOUS BALL GOWNS OUT THERE THAT ARE DESIGNED WITH ROUCHING HERE THAT HIDES A MULTITUDE OF SINS
SO YOU WANT TO ATTACK THE BALL WHICH IS WHAT YOU WOULD DO DURING A PASSING PATTERN YOU WANT TO ATTACK THE BALL AND GET IT INTO YOUR POSSESSION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
NOW AS YOU GET A LITTLE BIT MORE SOPHISTICATED WITH IT YOU AGGRESSIVELY CATCH THE BALL OUT OF THE AIR
THROW THE BALL UP
NOW WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANYBODY AROUND AND CHRIS IS OVER HERE AND BRIAN'S JUST DOING HIS WORKOUT WHAT BRIAN CAN DO AND I JUST CALL IT THE LONELY BOY WORKOUT IS JUST THROW THE BALL UP TO YOURSELF AND WORK ON CATCHING JUST WORK ON YOUR CATCHING TECHNIQUE
AND THIS WILL BE THE TRUEST THING THAT HE CAN DO FOR HIMSELF IS TO KEEP HIS ARMS PUMPING JUST LIKE HE WOULD DURING RUNNING A ROUTE AND GET THE BALL RIGHT INTO HIS WINDOW
NOW AS BRIAN GETS MORE COMFORTABLE HE CAN THROW THE BALL UP EMULATE A RUNNING AND THEN BREAK DOWN AND CATCH THE BALL
TAKE THE STRAP AROUND THE BALL OF THE FOOT AND LAY RIGHT DOWN
AND TO GET THAT BALL SOUND AGAIN YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR PLIE TO DIG INTO THE GROUND
O.K SO I'M GOING TO START WITH THE BALL HERE AND I'M GOING TO PUSH STRAIGHT OUT
OR YOU CAN DO A MEDICINE BALL AND NO WEIGHT AT ALL
YOU KICK WITH THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT OR THE INSIDE OF YOUR FOOT
NUMBER FOUR THE BALL FURTHER BACK IN YOUR STANCE
SO THE PROBLEM WITH HITTING OFF OF THIS IS YOU CAN'T GET THE CLUB UNDERNEATH THE BALL LIKE YOU CAN IN GRASS OR SAND OR EVEN LOOSE IMPEDIMENTS
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN LOSE A LOT OF STROKES IS WHEN YOU HIT A SKULL WHEN YOU SKULL A BALL YOU CAN GO INTO WATER SAND TREES WHO KNOWS WHERE
SO YOU'RE GOING TO LINE UP LIKE YOU WOULD HIT A NORMAL SHOT BUT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT BEING SUPER RELAXED BECAUSE IF YOU TRY MUSCLE THIS BALL AT ALL WHAT HAPPENS IS OFF HARD PAN THE CLUB HITS THE HARD PAN AND THEN SKIPS INTO THE BACK OF THE BALL PRODUCING A SKULL SHOT
OKAY NOW I'M READY TO TAKE THE CLUB BACK PROPERLY AND TO PUT PROPER POWER FROM THE BODY INTO HITTING THE BALL
YOU DON'T HAVE TO UNDERSTAND ANY OF THAT YOU JUST HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU'RE IN A CERTAIN POSITION AND YOU PUT THE BALL UP THERE OFF OF THE GLASS IT'S GOING TO COME IN AND BOUNCE INTO THE RIM
THE BALL WAS THROWN WITHIN HIS ZONE OF CATCHING ABILITY BUT IT SOMEHOW GOT PAST HIM
NOW A PASSED BALL IS VERY SIMILAR TO A WILD PITCH
SO BASICALLY WHAT IT IS IS IT'S TWO PLAYERS WHO TURN THEIR STICKS WITH THE BACKS TOWARDS EACH OTHER WITH THE BALL IN THE MIDDLE AND YOU HAVE BOTH HANDS ON THE STICK AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GET UP UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND FLING THE BALL ABOVE YOUR HEADS AND THEN ALL THE TEAMMATES KIND OF MOVE IN TO TRY TO GET THE BALL AND GRAB POSSESSION
AND I'LL SQUEEZE IT A LITTLE BIT SO THAT I CAN GET THIS BALL MOIST AND THEN I'LL TAKE MY RIGHT HAND AND PUSH TOWARDS MY LEFT HAND AND UP AND THEN DOWN USING THE HEEL OF MY LEFT HAND TO KEEP THAT CLAY FROM PUSHING OUT VERY FAR
FIRST YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR BALL OF CLAY AND YOU WANT IT TO BE AS ROUND AS POSSIBLE THAT MAKES CENTERING MUCH EASIER AND THROW IT DOWN PRETTY HARD RIGHT ON THE CENTER OF THE WHEEL
THE OVERHEAD PASS IS EFFECTIVE DURING THE GAME WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF SPACE BETWEEN YOU AND THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PASS IT TO AND YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO GET IT THERE WITH SOME ZIP SO THAT THE DEFENSE DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO GET IN BETWEEN AND TRY TO STEAL THE BALL
BUT IF THE BALL IS IN THE AIR AND YOU HIT IT THAT'S A VOLLEY
ALL A VOLLEY IS IS YOU TAKE A BALL BEFORE IT BOUNCES SO OBVIOUSLY IF A BALL BOUNCES LIKE THIS THAT'S A GROUND STROKE
WHEN I BRING MY EYES BACK TO THE BALL I GO AHEAD AND HIT IT
I HAVE MY BALL JOINT PICKLE FORK
OF COURSE A BALL JOINT PRESS WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE TO CHANGE THIS GUY
AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A PARTICULAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LOWER BALL JOINT AND THE UPPER BALL JOINT CONTROL ARM ASSEMBLY
THE CONTROL ARM ASSEMBLY HAS THE BALL JOINT ALREADY PRESSED IN IT
WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR FEET TOGETHER YOU TRY TO JOIN THE TOES TOGETHER THE BALL OF THE FOOT THE HEEL OF THE FOOT
NOW CLUB JUGGLING TRICKS ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM BALL JUGGLING TRICKS
ALRIGHT SO WE HANDLED THE TOP LET'S HANDLE THE BOTTOM HALF I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND HOLD THE BALL RIGHT BEHIND ME EXTENDING MY ARMS AWAY FROM ME
SO KEEP THAT IN MIND WHENEVER YOU'RE PLAYING BALL THE OVERHEAD PASS IS REALLY EFFECTIVE
IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CORRECT PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZE VEHICLE
TO GET OUT OF THIS BRING THE WEIGHTS DOWN DROP THE HIPS LIFT THE HEAD AND WALK YOURSELF BACK UP ON THE BALL
SO WE CAN SEE HERE THAT WE'VE GOT OUR POWER BALL DISPENSER AN ELEVATOR A DOOR THAT'S BLOCKING A POWER BALL RECEPTACLE AND ANOTHER ELEVATOR OVER HERE
SO WHEN WE ARE DOING THIS MOTION OF EXPANDING OUTWARD WE HAVE TO ALSO BE THINKING WE'RE EXPANDING DOWN WE'RE EXPANDING BACK WE'RE EXPANDING UP IT'S LIKE A BALL OR I LIKE TO SEE IT AS A SUN EXPLODING OUTWARD
AND BUT YOU WANT TO LOB IT UP AND GIVE THE PLAYER ENOUGH TIME TO CATCH THE BALL AND DELIVER INTO THE BASKET WITH VORACITY
SO A DRAW ONCE AGAIN IS TAKING THE BALL FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
IT'S A WAY OF AVOIDING A LOT OF TROUBLES IN YOUR WAY AND ALSO GETTING THE BALL IF THE GREEN IS HEAVILY BUNKERED AND THE PIN'S ON THE LEFT SIDE THIS IS A WAY OF TRACKING THE BALL TOWARD THE PIN
SO IT'S GOING TO GET EASIER AND EASIER TO HOOK THE BALL
SO YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE NORMAL UNDER SPIN OF STRIKING A BALL BUT WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE THE FACE LIKE THIS TO CREATE SOME SIDE SPIN SO THE BALL WILL SPIN AND GO TO THE LEFT
SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS THIS IS HOW YOU LINE UP FOR THE NORMAL STRAIGHT BALL
SO AGAIN YOU'RE PLACING THE BALL IN FRONT OF YOU PUSHING DOWN THROUGH THE HANDS EXTENDING OUT THROUGH THE HIPS AND THEN DRIVING THE ELBOWS INTO THE SIDE
SO IF MY HANDS DON'T HIT THE BALL AT THE EXACT SAME TIME IT'S AN ILLEGAL HIT
SO A SETTING DRILLS YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A TOSSER WHO WILL TOSS YOU THE BALL AND YOU GET UNDER IT YOU USE YOUR LEGS FACE YOUR TARGET AND YOU WANT TO PUSH THE BALL OUT WITH YOUR NOT ONLY YOUR WRISTS BUT YOUR LEGS ALSO AND FACE YOUR TARGET AND TRY TO GET IT IN THE TARGET
SO WHEN YOU ARE SETTING THE BALL YOU WANT TO TAKE THE BALL AND SHAPE YOUR HANDS IN THE SHAPE OF A BALL
OK MAKE SURE YOUR HANDS STAY FIRMLY ON THE MEDICINE BALL
YOU USE ENGLISH TO CONTROL THE ANGLES THAT A BALL COMES OFF OF A CUSHION NOT THE ANGLES THAT IT COMES OFF OF ANOTHER BALL
BUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR THIS TIME IS WHAT ANGLE DOES THE CUE BALL COME OFF OF THE CUSHION
OKAY IN THE LAST SEGMENT WE LEARNED THAT USING ENGLISH DOES NOT HELP US CONTROL THE DIRECTION THAT A CUE BALL COMES OFF OF AN OBJECT BALL AT AN ANGLE
SO I'M JUST GOING TO HIT THE BALL SOFTLY TO DARREN AND HE'S GOING TO HIT IT SOFTLY BACK TO ME
THIS WILL TEACH YOU HOW TO KEEP THE BALL IN PLAY AND TO HIT YOUR TARGETS
THIS NEEDS TO GO UP SO THAT NEEDS TO GO DOWN AND NOW YOU HAVE A NICE BALL OF CLAY AND THAT SHOULD HAVE NO AIR BUBBLES IN IT AND THIS IS HOW YOU CHECK IT AND THIS IS HOW YOU GET BETTER AT WEDGING TOO
SO IF I'M THROWING A THREE BALL PATTERN EACH THROW IS A THREE OF COURSE THE AVERAGE IS THREE
NOW WHEN YOU JUGGLE A THREE BALL PATTERN THAT'S JUST THREE THREE THREE CONTINUING
SO EACH THROW IS A THREE BALL HEIGHT AND THEY JUST CROSS LIKE THIS
WHEN IT COMES TO THE SOCCER BALL THE SOCCER BALL NEEDS TO BE 68 TO SEVENTY CM IN DIAMETER AND IT WILL HAVE ABOUT 410 TO 450 GRAMS OF WEIGHT IN THERE SO THAT IT REALLY DOESN'T WEIGH TOO MUCH
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS YOU HAVE TO GO GET THE BALL
IF THE BALL GOES OFF THE RIGHT RIDE YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACK THE RIGHT SIDE
WRIST UP BRING THE BALL UP AND ABOUT HERE I WILL RELEASE THE BALL
RIGHT ABOUT WHEN YOU ARE ABOUT THIS DISTANCE YOU RELEASE THE BALL SO THE BALL GOES
YOU WANT TO START THE SERVE WITH THE BALL UNDER THE NET JUST AS I HAVE IT
SO THE REFEREE WILL PLACE THE BALL IN THE BACK OF YOUR STICK AND YOU SET UP AND YOU'LL WAIT FOR THE WHISTLE BUT WE'RE JUST GOING TO COUNT TO THREE OKAY
BECAUSE IT'S THE CLUB HEAD THAT HITS THE BALL AND THE BALL KNOWS ALL AND THE ONLY THING THE BALL KNOWS IS IMPACT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THERE BUT IF YOU COULD WATCH THE CLUB HEAD AT HOME IN PRACTICE SWINGS IN YOUR BACKYARD
THE REASON YOU WANT TO CLAP IS BECAUSE YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW HIGH TO TOSS THE BALL UP TO GIVE YOU ENOUGH TIME TO CATCH IT
SO YOU GOT TO BE REAL LOOSE YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR FEET AND YOUR KNEES BENT AND JUST NICE AND RELAXED AND JUST GET UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND LET THE CLUB DO THE WORK AND YOU'LL HAVE GREAT SUCCESS
THROW THROW THROW THROW AND THIS IS OUR THREE BALL CASCADE PATTERN
WE ADD THE THIRD BALL AND THE PATTERN HERE WILL JUST BE SOLID THROWS
SO THIS IS A TOUGH LIE BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE TO TRY TO GET UNDERNEATH THE BALL A LITTLE BIT TO GET IT UP
SO WHAT YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO DO HERE IS TO PICK THE BALL CLEANLY OFF THIS SURFACE BECAUSE IT IS ALMOST LIKE HITTING OFF OF CONCRETE
SO WHEN YOU GET A BAD LIE IN FAIRWAY SAND JUST SAY OKJUST TAKE THE APPROPRIATE CLUB AND JUST PITCH THE BALL OUT OF THERE SO YOU LIVE TO SWING ANOTHER DAY
YOU'RE GOING TO GET A SCOOP OR A BALL OF ACRYLIC POWDER OUT AND APPLY TO THE NAIL
THE WAY THIS TECHNIQUE WORKS WITH AN OPPONENT IS I PUNCH WITH THE LEFT AND BLOCK WITH THE LEFT HAND SHOOT THE RIGHT LEG IN KIND OF LIKE YOU WERE GOING TO KICK THE LOWER LEG EXCEPT YOU ARE GOING TO PASS BY BRING THE RIGHT LEG AROUND AND HIT WITH THE HEEL OR THE BALL OF THE FOOT
I NOW HAVE A SHOT ON THE EIGHT BALL
A DRAW SHOT AGAIN IS ONE WHERE I'M GOING TO POCKET THAT BALL AND I'M GOING TO MAKE THAT CUE BALL COME BACK TOWARDS ME
YOU DON'T NEED AN EXPENSIVE PAIR OF CLEATS YOU DON'T NEED A FANCY JERSEY JUST THE BALL AND THE ABILITY TO HAVE A GOOD TIME
AND SO TO WIN A DRAW YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE STURDY THAT YOUR LEGS ARE PLANTED FIRMLY AND YOU WANT TO HAVE A GOOD GRIP ON YOUR STICK AND THE WAY YOU WIN IT IS GET UNDERNEATH THE BALL REALLY QUICK AND HIT UP
SO WORK ON THAT AND YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD FOUR BALL START
YOU CAN DO A STEADY ONE FINGER PRESSURE JUST STAYING IN THAT PLACE OR YOU CAN DO A CIRCULAR MOTION WITH YOUR THUMB OR WITH THE BALL OF YOUR FINGER
ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AS WELL THERE WILL BE A BEAD ANY PART OF THE STICK RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE BALL IS GOING TO BE INSIDE AGAINST THE MILK CARTOON SO YOU REALLY WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING THE STICK DIRTY WHILE YOU'RE PAINTING IT
THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOING TO BE SEEN FROM THE OUTSIDE IS BASICALLY THE BALL ITSELF
ON THE TOP PART THERE'S GOING TO BE A BEAD PLACED ON IT SO THAT IT THE BALL WILL SIT SECURELY AND WON'T FALL OFF THE STICK
SO IT'S ALSO EASY TO PAINT IT WHILE IT'S ON THE STICK BECAUSE A BALL IS HARD TO GRIP WHILE PAINTING IT SO THIS WAY IT GIVES US A WAY TO HOLD ONTO THE BALL AND GET ALL SIDES UNDERNEATH AND ON TOP ALL AROUND THE BALL VERY EASILY WHILE IT'S ON THE STICK
NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PAINT THE STYROFOAM BALL MEANING THAT THE STYROFOAM BALL IS GOING TO BE SITTING AT PRETTY MUCH IT'S GOING TO BE THE CENTER OF THE WINDMILL WHERE ALL THE ARMS ARE GOING TO BE HANGING
I KNOW THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SHOOTING BUT LET'S DO A REFRESH COURSE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO PUT THE BALL IN THE BASKET
I'M RIGHT HANDED SO I'M GOING TO PLACE MY HAND BEHIND THE BALL AS SUCH INTO THE GROOVE
SO WHAT THAT DOES IS THE RACKET JUST PUSHES THE BALL RIGHT ABOVE THE TIN
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS REALLY BE CONSCIOUS OF KEEPING THE BALL LOW OR IN OTHER WORDS YOU DON'T WANT THE BALL REALLY HIGH THROWS THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO CATCH
KEEP IT LOW AND REALLY BE CONSCIOUS OF THE BALL TRAVELING PAST YOUR EAR AND DROPPING RIGHT BEHIND YOUR SHOULDER AND IF YOU HAVE TO KICK YOUR SHOULDER OUT A LITTLE BIT FORWARD TO GET YOUR ARM BACK THERE THAT'S OK
SQUEEZE YOUR LEGS TOGETHER SQUEEZE YOUR KNEES TOGETHER AS IF YOU'RE TRYING TO SQUEEZE A TIGHT BALL SQUEEZE TIGHT FOR ABOUT FIVE SECONDS RELAX AND TRY TO BEND FURTHER
SO THAT'S HOW YOU PLAY THE LONGER IRON WHEN THE BALL IS ABOVE YOUR FEET
AND AFTER YOU ALSO WANT TO DO CIRCLES TO FLEX THE JOINTS ON YOUR BALL AND SOCKET HERE
AGAIN I MIGHT NEED TO FIND SOMETHING LIKE A BALL OR SOMETHING SHE REALLY ENJOYS AND I WILL WORK WITH TWO SO IF SHE IS WITH THIS TOY AND SHE IS HEADING AWAY FROM ME I AM GOING TO GO TO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WITH YET ANOTHER SQUEAKY TOY
I LOVE THE BALL YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN THESE IN THE GYMS ALL OVER THE PLACE
I'M GOING TO TAKE THE BALL AND I'M GOING TO PUT IT RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE
AND I LIKE TO START LOWER AND THEN WORK MY WAY UP BECAUSE SOMETIMES WITH THE HEAVIER BALL IF YOU DROP IT YOU CAN GET HURT
SO NOW I HAVE A FOUR-POUND BALL
IF YOUR CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT ELSE I'VE DONE WITH IT JUST FEEL FREE TO BROWSE AROUND AND LOOK FOR THE WOOD CHOP WHERE THERE'S SITTING ON THE BALL THERE'S STANDING AND HOW DIFFERENT AH THE DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF THE MOVE SO THAT YOU CAN GET YOU DON'T GET BORED LIKE THAT YOU KNOW
THE WOOD CHOP WITH A MEDICINE BALL IS JUST A VARIATION OF THE WOOD CHOP MOVE
IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT REMOVAL OF A COUPLE OF BRAKE COMPONENTS IN ORDER TO PERFORM OUR BALL JOINT SERVICE
IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CORRECT PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZE VEHICLE
ACTUALLY YOU WANT TO START HERE AND GET THE BALL UP AND THAT'S HOW THE TOSS IS DONE
AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN DO ALL OF THE FUNDAMENTAL THINGS RIGHT YOU CAN COME OFF THE SCREEN YOU CAN BE OPEN FOR A SECOND YOU CAN CATCH THE BALL YOU CAN GET IT READY IN THE SHOOTERS POCKET YOU CAN BE READY TO DELIVER THE SHOT BUT YOU HAVE A GOOD DEFENDER ON YOU THAT'S GOING TO COME OUT AND PLAY DEFENSE ON YOU AND THAT MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT TIME TO TAKE THE SHOT
SOMETIMES YOUR DEFENDERS GO AHEAD AND CATCH THE BALL SOMETIMES YOUR DEFENDERS ARE GOING TO LAY BACK ON YOU AND KEEP THEIR HANDS DOWN
IF YOU ARE A PITCHER YOU WANT THE BALL TO SINK YOU WANT IT TO SAIL YOU WANT TO DART YOU WANT IT TO DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS MAKES IT TOUGHER FOR THE BATTER TO HIT
ON THE FLIP SIDE WHEN YOU THROW A BASEBALL TO ONE OF YOUR TEAM MATES YOU WANT IT TO BE AS STRAIGHT AND TRUE AS POSSIBLE YOU DON'T THE BALL TO STEPPING AND DARTING AND TO DO THAT YOU WANT TO GET THE PROPER FORESEAM GRIP
HERE'S THE PROPER GRIP WHEN YOU THROW THE BALL THUMB TUCKED UNDER AND THE REASON BEING WHEN YOU THROW THE BALL AND IT COMES OUT OF YOUR FINGERS YOU HAVE FOUR SEAMS BREAKING AIR IT WILL TEND TO STAY STRAIGHTER THAN IF YOU THREW THE BALL THIS WAY WHERE THE SEAMS MAY MAKE IT SINK
NOW YOUR MOM ALWAYS TELLS YOU DON'T PLAY BALL IN THE HOUSE BUT HERE IS A DRILL YOU CAN DO AT HOME SITTING IN A CHAIR
TAKE YOUR GLOVE JUST THROW THE BALL IN CHAIR PULL IT OUT AND GET THE PROPER GRIP
THE IODINE TABLETS COME IN A LITTLE BOTTLE WITH LIKE A LITTLE COTTON BALL ON TOP AND YOU JUST PUT ONE OF THE TABLETS IN THERE AND YOU WAIT FOR A HALF AN HOUR OR WHATEVER IT SAYS ON THE BOTTLE AND THEN THE WATER IS BASICALLY GOOD TO DRINK IT TAKES CARE OF ALL THE STUFF THAT'S IN THE WATER
WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE FIRST STRING ON WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE BALL END OF THE STRING WE'RE GOING TO PUT THAT RIGHT IN THIS SLOT ON THE TAIL PIECE
ALRIGHT THESE THREE GUYS BRING THE BALL DOWN AS SOON AS THEY BRING THE BALL DOWN THE FIRST TWO GUYS OFF THE SIDE LINE COME IN AND ESTABLISH THEIR DEFENSIVE POSITION
AND IF YOU BROKE THEM UP REALLY GOOD BUT YOU DIDN'T POCKET A BALL AND YOU TURN CONTROL OF THE TABLE OVER TO YOUR OPPONENT ALL YOU'VE DONE IS OPEN EVERYTHING UP SO THAT YOUR OPPONENT HAS AN EASY ROAD TO RUN OUT AND BEAT YOU OFF OR YOUR OWN BREAK
HOWEVER IF YOU DON'T BREAK PROPERLY AND SAY YOU SCRATCH ON THE BREAK OR YOU DON'T POCKET A BALL ALL YOU'RE DOING AT THAT POINT IS JUST TURNING CONTROL OVER THE TABLE TO YOUR OPPONENT
SO THE OBJECTIVE ON THE BREAK IS TO OF COURSE POCKET AT LEAST ONE BALL WHICH IS THEN GOING TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY AT THE TABLE AND TRY TO POCKET MORE BALLS
NOW YOU CAN ALSO ADD SHADOWING TO THE BALL OF YARN
SO WHEN YOU'RE SERVING THE BALL TAKE THE BALL IN FRONT OF YOU TOSS IT IN FRONT OF YOU TAKE YOUR HAND BACK LEAD WITH YOUR ELBOW KEEP YOUR HAND OPEN AND SERVE THE BALL OVER THE NET
SO I ACTUALLY WILL NOT EVEN LOOK AT MY BOWLING BALL UNTIL AFTER IT PASSES MY MARK
RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE LOOKING AFTER YOU THROW THE BALL
AND THIS IS THE TYPE OF BALL A BALL THAT IS IN FRONT OF YOU YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO STEP INTO IT AND KIND OF ATTACK THE PLAYER
SO AFTER A LITTLE BIT OF THIS I'LL SWITCH OFF AND I'LL GO TO A FULL CIRCLE WITH MY BOWLING BALL
YOUR CUE BALL STARTS IN THE SAME PLACE
YOUR OBJECT BALL STARTS RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF THE TABLE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO KICK THE BALL IN EITHER ONE OF THESE TWO POCKETS FROM THAT SETUP
THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO PRACTICE THESE SHOTS BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO KNOW HOW MUCH A BALL HOOKS WHEN YOU SWING ON THE PRACTICE RANGE BEFORE YOU HAVE TO DO IT ON THE GOLF COURSE
TO BEGIN WITH THE STABILITY ON THE BOSU WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN AND YOU ARE GOING TO BRING THE BLACK SIDE TO THE TOP AND THE BALL PART IS GOING TO BE ON THE BOTTOM AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO PUT MY FEET ON HERE IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT O'KAY AND YOU MIGHT BE A LITTLE NERVOUS BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO BRING BOTH OF YOUR FEET ON TOP OF THE BALL AND IT LOOKS JUST LIKE THAT
NOW SOMETIMES IT CAN HELP IF YOU DEFLATE THE BALL A LITTLE BIT TO GET STARTED BUT THIS ONE IS PRETTY BLOWN UP AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO BRING OURSELVES UP ON TOP OF THAT BALL AND WORK ON GETTING THAT BALANCE BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING ELSE
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IS THE BALL COMES OUT COMES OUT OF YOUR HAND AND SPIRALS TO GIVE IT THE ULTIMUM TRAJECTORY TO YOUR TARGET
BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THIS GUY IS GOING TO CATCH THE BALL AND HE'S GOING TO DRIVE PAST HIS MAN
THIS GUY RIGHT NOW HAS THE BALL SO HE HAS TO COMMIT TO HIM AND HE HAS TO GUARD HIM FULLY BUT AS QUICKLY AS THE BALL MOVES FROM THERE GO AHEAD AND MOVE IT TO THE TOP OF THE KEY
REASON BEING IS SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT HAVE THE BALL AND ANOTHER TEAM MIGHT FOUL YOU BUT YOU MIGHT STILL MAINTAIN POSSESSION OF THE BALL OR A TEAMMATE MIGHT POSSESS THE BALL AND GIVE YOURSELF A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SCORE A GOAL
NOW SAY THAT THE PLAY IS GOING ON AND THERE IS A FOUL AND YOU TOUCH THE BALL BUT DO NOT GET GOOD POSSESSION AND THEN THE OTHER TEAM GETS IT INITIALLY THE OFFICIAL MIGHT NOT STOP BECAUSE HE THINKS YOU HAVE AN ADVANTAGE
IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE TOOLS REQUIRED AND THE PARTS NECESSARY TO REPLACE YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZED VEHICLE
IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CORRECT PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZED VEHICLE
IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE PROPER PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZE VEHICLE
IN THIS CLIP WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE LAST STEP INVOLVED IN OUR BALL JOINT SERVICE
DURING OUR BALL JOINT SERVICE WE HAD TO REMOVE OUR VEHICLES BREAK IN CALIPER
IF YOU'RE NOT REACHING THE FLOOR THAT MEANS THE BALL IS TOO BIG FOR YOU SO ADJUST THE SIZE ACCORDINGLY OR YOU CAN DO IT RIGHT HERE
BUT ANYWAY THROW THE BALL INTO THE GLOVE PULL IT OUT WITH THE PROPER GRIP
AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A MEDICINE BALL AND BASICALLY WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO CHEST PASSES BACK AND FORTH
I THINK IT WAS BACK EAST THESE KIDS DECIDED TO START THROWING A BALL INTO A CUP
THEN ONCE YOU'VE GOT THAT YOU CAN ADD ONE MORE THROW AND SO ON UNTIL YOU CAN KEEP IT GOING JUST LIKE YOUR THREE BALL PATTERN
ONCE THE BALL IS IN THE AIR WE'RE GOING TO REPEAT THAT MOTION OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND JUST POPPING IT UP AND WATCHING IT AS IT COMES DOWN
SO JUST LIFTING THE BALL UP IN THE AIR POPPING IT UP AND IT PRETTY MUCH ALLOWS US TO BE BOUNCING IT AFTER THAT
SO PUT THE BALL ON THE GROUND ROLL IT UP TO THE CLUB PUSH IT ONTO THE CLUB AND IN ONE SWIFT MOTION WE'RE GOING TO LIFT AND THEN LOWER THE CLUB
TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO BOUNCE A GOLF BALL ON THE FLAT SURFACE OF A GOLF CLUB
SEE IF HE'LL GO OUT THERE TO GET IT WHEN HE GOES OUT PRAISE HIM HEAVILY AND ALLOW HIM TO GET THAT BALL
SO MAYBE IF A DOG LOVES A BALL THROW A BALL OUT INTO THE WATER
NOW TO GET YOUR TIMING TO REALLY NAIL THAT TIMING DOWN WE'RE GOING TO TOSS THAT BALL UP AND CLAP IN BETWEEN
SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR FAVORITE BALL
WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO ONE BALL FOR JUST A MOMENT
WHICH IS SHOWING WHAT THAT IS IT'S A FAKE JUST A FAKE TO ONE SIDE SO THEY THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GO THAT WAY BUT THE BALL IS JUST GOING TO KEEP GOING THE SAME WAY AND YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT
ONCE YOU GET A BOX OUT THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GO AND YOU'RE GOING TO EXPLODE UP AND YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THE BALL AND YOU'RE GOING TO RIP IT OFF THE BACK BOARD
THE OBJECT OF SOCCER IS TO POSSES THE BALL AND WORK IT DOWN THE FIELD IN ORDER TO SCORE A GOAL
ALL YOU REALLY NEED IS A BALL AND A FIELD TO PLAY IN
YOU CANNOT BOX OUT AND ALLOW THE BALL TO COME TO YOU
BREATHE NICE AND EASY AND TAKE A NICE EASY SWING AND REMEMBER YOU JUST WANT TO PICK THE BALL CLEANLY OFF OF THIS WITH A MINIMAL DIVOT
SO YOUR OPPONENT HITS A PRETTY GOOD SHOT AND YOU JUST SEE I'VE JUST KEPT THE RACKET ON THERE I'M NOT DOING IT LIKE A DROP SHOT A MORE TRADITIONAL ONE I'VE GOT MY RACKET OUT AND I'M JUST USING THE STRINGS I'M JUST BLOCKING THE BALL SO IT JUST GOES RIGHT ABOVE THE TIN
YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR BRACELETS INTERFERING WITH THE BOWLING BALL THAT CAN KIND OF RUIN YOUR GAME THAT CAN BE A LITTLE DISTRACTING
EXCELLENT HE'S FOUND HIS BALL HE NOW CAN GO AHEAD AND PLAY HIS SECOND SHOT AND WE'VE HELPED SPEED UP THE PACE OF PLAY
SO YOU NEVER LEAD WITH YOUR HAND YOU WANT TO ALWAYS LEAD WITH YOUR ELBOW IT WILL HELP YOU TO GET THE BALL STRAIGHT OVER THE NET TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE SERVE
WHEN YOU CONTACT THE BALL YOU WANT TO HIT IT ALMOST TO THE HEEL OF YOUR PALM AND IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR HAND
SO WHEN YOU TOSS THE BALL YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR ELBOW BACK AND WHEN YOU HIT YOU LEAD WITH YOUR ELBOW
WHEN YOU KEEP YOUR HAND OPEN YOU HAVE MORE SURFACE AREA ON THE BALL WHICH CAN HELP YOU TO GUIDE THE BALL TO WHERE YOU WANT IT TO GO ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE COURT
SO WHEN YOU'RE SERVING THE BALL YOU WANT YOUR HAND OUT IN FRONT OF YOU AND YOU WANT TO TOSS THE BALL UP IN FRONT OF YOU SO YOU HAVE TOP STEP AND HIT IT WITH YOUR HAND
I WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE BALL IN THE CORNER POCKETWHICH I WOULD MAKE AND THEN I WOULD PUT MYSELF IN A POSITION YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TRY TO PLAY POSITION IT'S ANOTHER VIDEO TAPE FOLKS BUT I PUT MYSELF IN SUCH A POSITION NOW THAT I COULD PLAY THE TEN BALL IN THIS CORNER AND MAKE MY Q BALL COME OUT FOR A GOOD POSITIONING SHOT FOR THE EIGHT BALL AND WINNING THE GAME
LET ME JUST SHOW YOU THE LEGAL SHOTS I WOULD MAKE HERE ON THE TWELVE AND ON THE TEN BALL OF THE STRIPES
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WHEN POCKETING YOUR BALLS LEGALLY AND SCORING ALL OF YOUR BALLS FIRST BEFORE YOUR OPPONENT DOES AND GIVING YOU A GOOD EXECUTION SHOT FOR WINNING THE GAME AND SHOOTING THE EIGHT BALL IN CLEAN
SO I WOULD SAY TEN BALL IN THE CORNER AND YOU SEE THE Q BALL COMES OUT TO A POSITION ON THE TABLE WHERE I HAVE A NICE SHOT AN ANGLE SHOT FOR THE EIGHT BALL IN THE CORNER
THEN WE ADDED THE SECOND BALL AND TRIED THE SAME THING
WE STARTED WITH JUST A SINGLE BALL
TO THROW A THREE BALL PATTERN
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE BALL GOING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
SO THE BALL SNAPS SET GO HE'S GOING TO USE A SWIM DO EVERYTHING THAT HE NORMALLY DOES IT'S GOING TO LOOK JUST LIKE A ROUTE
NOW I'VE DONE SOME OTHER ONES WHERE YOU CAN SPIN AROUND AND CATCH THE BALL AND THESE ARE FOR DOWN DEEP PATTERNS WHERE YOU'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING BACK OVER YOUR SHOULDER AND IT'S THE TRUEST WAY TO DISORIENT YOURSELF AND LOCATE THE BALL AT THE SAME TIME
AND BRIAN CAN DO THIS A HUNDRED TIMES A DAY AND HIS HAND WILL IMPROVE HIS VISION FOR THE BALL AND HIS ABILITY TO LOCATE
LOOKS AS THOUGH MY PARTNER HAS HIT THE BALL INTO THE WOODS
I'M GOING TO TALK TODAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT TO DO IF YOUR PARTNER LOSES HIS GOLF BALL OR HOW TO HELP HIM FIND IT
AS YOU CAN SEE MY PLAYING PARTNER HAS LOST HIS BALL ON THIS HOLE AND IN THE GAME OF GOLF IT IS GOOD ETIQUETTE OR CUSTOMARY TO HELP HIM FIND HIS BALL
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF ETIQUETTE NOT ONLY WILL YOU HELP SPEED UP PLAY BUT YOU'LL ALSO BE DOING YOUR PARTNER A FAVOR BY HELPING HIM TRY TO LOCATE HIS BALL
HE IS GOING TO RE-TEE THE BALL AND HIT A PROVISIONAL JUST IN CASE WE CAN'T FIND THE FIRST ONE THAT HE HIT INTO THE WOODS
SO WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AROUND HERE AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND HIS BALL
UP IN FRONT IN THESE SMALL PACKAGES WE HAVE OUR LOWER BALL JOINTS WITH THE RETAINING NUTS AND HARDWARE INSIDE
WE HAVE THE UPPER CONTROL ARM BALL JOINT ASSEMBLY
LIKE I SAID IT'S AN UPPER CONTROL ARM BALL JOINT ASSEMBLY
YOU SEE HOW THE BODY TURNS JUST TO THROW A BALL
THAT'S CALLED A BODY TURN SO NOW I'VE GOT MY BODY COILED AND WHEN I UNCOIL IT GENERATES A LOT OF POWER TO HIT THE GOLF BALL
BECAUSE WHEN THE BALL COMES OFF A LOB IT'S GOING TO BE VERY STEEP SO HE'S NOT ABLE TO HIT IT AS POWERFULLY OR AS ACCURATELY IF I EXECUTE MY LOB SERVE WELL
AS SOON AS THESE GUYS GO OUT THIS GUY JOINS THEM SO THEN IT'S THREE ON TWO THESE GUYS GET THE BALL THEY BRING IT DOWN AND THEN IT'S THREE ON TWO IT GOES BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH
IT GOES ON FOR HOURS IT'S A GREAT DRILL YOU DEVELOP A LOT OF BALL HANDLING SKILLS
WIDE BASE ARMS OUT ESTABLISH CONTACT LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY BALL COMES OFF YOU'RE AT LEAST TWO FEET AWAY FROM THE RIM ESTABLISH CONTACT FIRST THEN AGGRESSIVELY GET THE BASKETBALL
AND I MEAN THIS ISN'T A BALL BUT TRADITIONALLY THIS TYPE OF APPARATUS WAS IN A ROUND SHAPE
OK NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO STEEP TEA USING A DIFFUSING BALL
SO WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO IS WHEN YOU ARE HAVING A BALL YOUR SIZE MAKING SURE THAT THE THIGHS ARE PARALLEL TO THE FLOOR YOU'RE GOING TO ROLL INTO IT UNTIL THE HEAD IS PARALLEL TO THE FLOOR SO YOU HAVE THAT SUPPORT IT IS LIKE A PILLOW UNDER YOU
ABDOMINAL CRUNCH ON THE BALL
THE OTHER THING YOU CAN DO IS GET A BALL ANY TYPE OF LITTLE LIKE RUBBER BALL AND JUST KIND OF HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND AND JUST KIND OF PRACTICE CURLING EXERCISES
ONCE HE TAKES THE SNAP HE'LL TURN AND DO WHAT WE CALL SEEDING THE BALL
HE'S GOING TO SEED THE BALL AND IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE A FAKE TO THE FULLBACK
OUR QUARTERBACK RUNS JUST LIKE HE WOULD IN A NORMAL HAND OFF PLAY EXCEPT ONCE HE HANDS THE BALL OFF HE HAS TO ALSO TURN AND RUN TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FIELD SO HE CAN GO DOWN FIELD AND BECOME A BLOCKER AS WELL
SO YOU ARE TOSSING THE BALL JUST AS YOU ARE TAKING YOUR RACKET BACK BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO COME TO THE BACK SCRATCH
WHAT I LIKE TO SAY TO THE STUDENTS IS THINK OF A BASE OF A TRIANGLE AND YOU WANT TO GET THE BALL RIGHT OVER YOUR HEAD TO THE A PASS
WE THEN WANT TO TRY AND PUT THE WHOLE TOSS OF THE BALL AS YOU ARE TAKING IT BACK
THE BALL SHOULD STAY PRETTY STEADY
THE NEXT PAIR IS OLD BALL IT IS THE FORTH FRET AND THE NEXT STRING OPEN AND THEY SHOULD SOUND THE SAME
FORM IS REALLY IMPORTANT ON THIS ONE SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR HEAD AND YOUR SHOULDERS ARE ON THE BALL
BUT I HAVE TO MAKE SURE I GET THE BALL CLEANLY
SO GETTING MY SET UP THIS PARAMOUNT AND THE TENDENCY TO SLICE OR FAKE THE BALL OUT OF THE SAND
OR DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION I NEED TO PUT THE BALL SEVENTY FIVE YARDS
SO I'M GOING TO TRY MY SAND WEDGE SO HERE I'M NOT TRYING TO SPIN IT OR PUT ON THE GREEN I'M JUST TRYING TO ADVANCE THE BALL TOWARD THE GREEN OR TO GET IT TO THE GREEN WITH A FULL CLUB
IF YOU PUT THAT TOGETHER I GUARANTEE YOU ARE GOING TO HOOK THE BALL
YOU WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THOUGH THAT THE NETS REALLY DO HAVE A PURPOSE SO IF YOU'RE SETTING UP YOUR OWN BASKETBALL HOOP AT HOME YOU WANT TO DEFINITELY PUT A NET UP IT PREVENTS THE BALL FROM GOING OUT OF BOUNDS AND YOU HAVING TO CHASE IT DOWN ALL OVER THE PLACE
NOW ALSO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PLAYING BALL THE BRACE LOTS OF TIMES YOU'LL SEE A POLE LIKE THIS WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING OUTDOORS OR YOU'LL SEE AN ACTUAL COMBINATION OF THINGS BRACING THE BACKBOARD UP IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT INDOORS
IT DEPENDS ON HOW BIG THE BALL IS GOING TO BE THAT WE'RE USING FOR HIS EYE
IT EARLIER WAS PLAYED WITH PING-PONG PADDLES LIKE A TABLE TENNIS GAME AND THAT TURNED IN TO WHERE YOU JUST THROW THE BALL INTO THE CUP WHICH MADE IT A LOT EASIER AND YOU DRUNK A LOT QUICKER HONESTLY
BUT I WOULD USE I WOULD SAY SIDEWALK CEMENT WITHOUT ANY BIG DIVOTS TAKEN OUT OF IT OR ANYTHING IS A GOOD PLACE BECAUSE YOU NEED TO KNOW WHICH WAY THE BALL IS GOING TO BOUNCE BACK UP
OKAY AND YOU FEEL THE PRESSURE ON THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE SIX BALL IN THE SIDE POCKET
SO WHAT I DO IS I AIM MY STICK BEHIND THE CUE BALL AND WHERE I WANT TO HIT ON THE SIX BALL
HI MY NAME'S JOE I'M AT BREAKTIME BILLIARDS IN WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO FIGURE HOW FAR AWAY FROM THE BALL TO STAND AND ALSO HOW TO MAKE A STANCE
YOU'RE ACTUALLY JUST STARING AT YOUR MARK THE WHOLE ENTIRE TIME UNTIL YOUR BOWLING BALL PASSES THE MARK
FROM COMING UP HERE WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE BALL OUTSIDE THE COURT ON THIS SIDE TO COME IN A LITTLE MORE BACK AND CORRECT THAT MISTAKE YOU'RE MAKING
SO JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU KEEP YOUR ELBOWS CLOSE TO YOUR BODY AND YOU CONTACT THE BALL AT THIS POINT IN FRONT OF YOU
AGAIN NORMALLY HAPPENS ON THE BACKHAND SIDE BECAUSE WE ARE MOVING OUR BODY FORWARD AND WHEN WE'RE AIMING THE BALL AS YOU CAN SEE MY FACE OF THE RACQUET IS LOOKING OVER THERE INSTEAD OF LOOKING IN FRONT OF ME AND IT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE MY WRIST IS GIVING UP MY LEFT WRIST IS GIVING UP OR MY BODIES GOING FORWARD
IF YOUR BALL IS GOING TOO MUCH TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE COURT THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE HITTING IT PROBABLY TOO MUCH IN FRONT OF YOU
WE ARE GOING TO DO THE BACKHAND VOLLEY AND GARY IS GOING TO HIT A BACKHAND DRIVE TO ME SO THIS IS A GOOD ANGLE TO SEE HOW GARY PREPARES THE RACQUET TURNS THE SHOULDER AND STEPS INTO THE BALL AND IT IS ALSO GOING TO BE GOOD TO WATCH HOW I KEEP MY RACQUET UP AND I VOLLEY THE BALL GENTLY BY JUST OPENING THE FACE AND PUTTING IT BACK ON THE WALL
SO LOOK AT HOW GARY JUST TURNS AND SITS THE BALL PRETTY EFFORTLESSLY STRAIGHT AND I JUST KEEP THE RACQUET OPEN AND IT REALLY DOESN'T TAKE MUCH WORK TO GET THE BALL BACK SO I HAVE DEVELOPED MY DROPPED VOLLEY AND GARY DEVELOPS HIS DRIVE AND IT IS QUITE A WORK OUT TOO
WATCH HOW GARY STEPS INTO THE BALL
ON THIS SEGMENT WE ARE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW IT LOOKS FROM ANOTHER ANGLE SO I WANT YOU TO TAKE NOTE OF HOW GARY TURNS AND GETS THE RACKET READY STEPS INTO THE BALL AND HITS IT BACK TO ME AND THEN NOTICE HOW I OPEN THE FACE OF THE RACQUET AND LOFT IT BACK SO HE CAN HIT IT BACK AGAIN
IN OTHER WORDS THAT'S THE ACTION THAT WE REALLY WANT ON THE CUE BALL IS NO ACTION AT ALL
WHAT WE WANT IT TO DO IS SLIDE INTO THAT BALL
BECAUSE IF IT SLIDES STRAIGHT IN TO THE OBJECT BALL WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THE CUE BALL IS GOING TO IMPART ALL OF IT'S ENERGY TO THE OBJECT BALL SENDING THE OBJECT BALL ON ITS WAY AND THE CUE BALL IS GOING TO LOSE EVERYTHING IT'S GOT GOING FOR IT AND IT'S GOING TO STOP DEAD STILL
OK OUR NEXT SHOT ON OUR THREE MOST BASIC CUE BALL POSITIONS SHOTS IS THE STOP SHOT
AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF AN ACTION DO WE NEED TO HAVE ON THE CUE BALL ON CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT BALL IN ORDER TO GET IT TO STOP
AND I'M JUST GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO BE LOOKING FOR ON EVERY STOP SHOT REGARDLESS OF DISTANCE IS YOU WANT TO BE TRYING TO CATCH THE CUE BALL IN IT'S SLIDE
SO FROM THIS POSITION RIGHT HERE IN ORDER TO SLIDE THIS BALL FROM THERE TO THERE IT SHOULD BE A SIMPLE MATTER OF HITTING IT RIGHT AT THE CENTER
YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR HANDS TOUCH THE BALL AT THE EXACT SAME TIME
SO WHEN YOU ARE SETTING THE BALL TAKE THE BALL ABOVE YOUR HEAD WHERE IF YOU MISS THE BALL IT WILL HIT YOU IN YOUR FOREHEAD
SO YOU TAKE THE BALL AND SET AND IT CAN NOT STAY IN YOUR HANDS VERY LONG SO YOU WANT TO GET IT OUT ALMOST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
SO THE SETTER IS GOING TO SET YOU THE BALL YOU TAKE YOUR APPROACH JUMP UP AND HIT IT OVER THE NET
WELL THE MAIN POINT IN ALL OF YOUR SQUASH IS TO GET BACK TO THE TEE AREA RIGHT HERE SO WHEN I SERVE IF I SERVE AN OVER HEAD SERVE I WANT TO WATCH THE BALL AND I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE TEE
WHETHER I SERVE BACKHANDED AND IF I SERVE A NICE SLOW BALL I CAN ALMOST WALK TO THE TEE AND IF I HIT IT A LITTLE HARDER I'VE GOT TO GET READY BUT GETTING TO THE TEE AFTER YOU HIT YOUR SERVE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU CAN DO
WATCH WHAT MY FEET DO AND I MOVE RIGHT OVER SO BEFORE THE BALL IS EVEN TO MY OPPONENT I AM BACK AT THE TEE
WE WILL JUST BE ABLE TO SHUT OFF THAT BALL VALVE
THIS IS GOING TO SHUT OFF THE WATER TO THE ENTIRE HOUSE AND HOPEFULLY WE WON'T HAVE TO BE DOING THIS ONCE WE INSTALL OUR BALL VALVE
IN THIS VIDEO CLIP I WILL SHOW YOU STEP TWO IN OUR PROCESS OF INSTALLING A BALL VALVE
IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A VOIDED BALL
SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS PUT A BALL ON THE TOP OF THE CLUB LOOK AT THAT BALL
SOMETIMES DEFENDERS ARE GOING TO CLOSE RIGHT OUT ON YOU AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A HAND ON THE BALL AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET A SHOT AWAY
YOU WANT TO SLIGHT BENDING THE KNEES FEET HIP WIDTH APART AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP TO THAT BALL OF YOUR FOOT WITHOUT LETTING GRAVITY PULL YOU FORWARD
SO WE HAVE ONE BALL TWO ONE UP TWO UP
THIS IS OUR NORMAL THREE BALL PATTERN AND WE THROW ONE STRAIGHT UP THEN WE THROW THE OTHER TWO STRAIGHT UP
LIKE THIS WHERE ONE BALL IS CONTINUOUSLY CROSSING OVER THE TOP OF THE OTHERS
WHERE EVERY BALL IS CROSSING OVER THE BALL IN FRONT OF IT
NEXT WE'LL BE MOVING ON TO SOME MORE ADVANCED BALL TRICKS
AS FAR AS FLIGHT PATHS EVERYTHING IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO THREE BALL JUGGLING EXCEPT YOU HAVE THE ADDED COMPLEXITY OF THE CLUB SPINNING AND YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH THE RIGHT END
ANOTHER WAY TO CLEAN THINGS YOU CAN DO THIS WITH THE PENS AS WELL IS TO JUST TAKE A PIECE OF PAPER AND GO LIKE THIS OF COURSE I CAN OPEN THIS UP A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT THAT'S HOW YOU WOULD CLEAN THE INSIDE ALSO WITH THOSE SPEED BALL PENS
OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT AS WELL USE A TENNIS BALL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
OBVIOUSLY AT THIS POINT THE BALL IS JUST A BRACE SO YOU DON'T NEED TO NECESSARILY INCREASE THE WEIGHT OF THE BALL BUT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF REPS ALRIGHT THE OBLIQUES
YOU'RE GOING TO TWIST YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER AND YOU'RE GOING TO TURN YOUR RIGHT FOOT OUT ON THE HEEL AND YOU'RE GOING TO ALLOW THE LEFT TOE TO TURN ON THE BALL OF THE FOOT
SO YOU'RE OPEN STANCE YOU KNOW THE BALL IS FORWARD ON YOU AND IF YOU HAVE TO GO FORWARD YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE THAT OPEN STANCE TOO MUCH
AND WHEN TO USE THIS WHAT KIND OF BALL TO USE THIS ON AND HOW TO RECOVER THERE OFF THAT
AND THIS IS FOR A BALL THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DEEPER THAT YOU'RE GOING TO JUST TO WANT TO YOU KNOW SAVE YOUR YOUR STEPS AND NOT HAVE TOO MANY
KNEELING SIDE CRUNCH WITH BALL WITH FITNESS BALL SUPPORT
ANYWAY IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE POSITIONING OF THE BALL I RECOMMEND THAT YOU WATCH THE CLIP WITH THE POSITIONING SO YOU LEARN HOW TO GET THE BALL CORRECTLY
THE LAST IN OUR THREE BASIC CUE BALL POSITION SHOTS IS THE DRAW SHOT
WHERE WHAT WE'RE WANTING TO DO IS PULL THE CUE BALL BACK TOWARDS US
IN OTHER WORDS IF WE HAD THIS SET UP RIGHT HERE IN OUR GAME OF EIGHT BALL ONCE AGAIN
THIS IS MY LAST OBJECT BALL ON THE TABLE
BUT AGAIN IF I'M GOING TO STOP MY CUE BALL RIGHT THERE THAT'S NOT GOING TO GIVE ME A GOOD SHOT
IF I FOLLOW ALONG BEHIND IT THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING FOR ME MY EIGHT BALL IS WAY OVER HERE
SO I NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE CUE BALL TO BRING IT BACK TO GIVE ME AN EASY SHOT ON THE EIGHT BALL
I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE SOME CRUNCHES WITH THE MEDICINE BALL
WITH THAT IN MIND I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE SOME MEDICINE BALL EXERCISES AND OF COURSE AS YOU GET STRONGER YOU INCREASE RESISTANCE BY GETTING A BIGGER HEAVIER MEDICINE BALL
HOLDING THE BALL RIGHT AT MY CHEST I TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN
INSTEAD OF HITTING EACH OTHER YOU'RE HITTING THE BALL
SO YOU TAKE THE BALL YOU TAKE THE RACKET YOU OPEN THE FACE AND YOU JUST BLOCK IT AGAINST THE WALL AND THAT'S A FOREHAND VOLLEY RIGHT THERE
IT FORCES ME TO PREPARE MY RACKET SO YOU SEE I HIT THE BALL I CAN'T HAVE THE RACKET JUST DROP DEAD
YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE THIS A LITTLE MORE PRONOUNCED THAN YOUR CAT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER TO SEE SO UNDERNEATH HERE I'M GOING TO HAVE SOME SHADOWING GOING ON UNDERNEATH THE BALL ON THE UNDERSIDE BUT I'M NOT GOING TO EXTEND IT ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP SO EXPERIMENT HOWEVER YOU LIKE WITH THE SHADOWING
SO WHEN WE DO DRIBBLE IF WE'RE PLAYING A GAME AND SOMEBODY ACTUALLY THROWS US THE BALL WELL WHAT DO WE DO
WE CAN SHOOT THE BALL WE CAN PASS THE BALL TO ONE OF OUR TEAMMATES OR WE CAN DRIBBLE
YOU DON'T WANT TO PALM THE BALL
FIRST THING YOU WANT TO CONSIDER IS JUST THE GRIP OF THE BALL
YOU KNOW MAYBE FIND THE THE SEAMS AND DEPENDING ON HOW BIG YOUR HANDS ARE YOU KNOW THE THUMB OF THE BALL OR THE THUMB ON ONE OF THE SEAMS AND THEN THREE AT LEAST THREE YOU KNOW OF YOUR FIRST FINGERS ON THE THE OUTSIDE OF THE SEAMS
SO IF MY TEAM SERVES THE BALL BUT YET THE OTHER TEAM GETS THE BALL AND PUTS IT INTO OUR SIDE OF THE COURT THEY GET THE POINT EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T SERVE THE BALL AND VICE VERSA
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO THROW THAT BALL UP IN AN ARK AND HAVE IT LAND IN THIS HAND WITHOUT THAT MUCH TROUBLE
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IT TO CREATE AN ARK SO THAT AT THE TOP OF THE BOX THE BALL GOES UP OVER IN A ARK AND ENDS UP IN YOUR OPPOSITE HAND
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS MUCH IN A SAME WAY THAT WE WERE THROWING THE ONE BALL UP AND CATCHING IT IN THE SAME SPOT
NUMBER THREE GET YOUR HANDS IN FRONT OF THE BALL
IF YOU BOX OUT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE FEELING CONTACT FIRST BEFORE YOU GO FOR THE BALL
IF YOU JUST GO FOR THE BALL WITHOUT ESTABLISHING CONTACT A REALLY SMART PLAYER LIKE MYSELF WILL SLIDE IN FRONT OF YOU AND BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THE POSITION
YOUR CUE STICK WILL BE ELEVATED IN THE BACK WHICH YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WILL MASSE A BALL IF YOU PUT ANY ENGLISH ON IT
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A BRIDGE THAT'S UP ON YOUR FINGERTIPS SO THAT YOU'LL BE OVER THE BALL
NOW WHAT MAKES IT SO DIFFICULT IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE TO ELEVATE THE END OF YOUR CUE STICK IF YOU DO NOT HIT DEAD CENTER ON THE BALL WHATEVER ENGLISHES THAT YOU WILL ACCIDENTALLY PUT ON THE CUE BALL WILL MAGNIFY BECAUSE IT'LL BE A SLIGHT MASSE SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HIT THE CENTER OF THE BALL OR IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON USING ENGLISH TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALLOW FOR IT
OCCASIONALLY WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING YOU GET LEFT A SHOT WHERE THE CUE BALL IS CLOSE TO ANOTHER BALL OR YOU PLAYED POSITION AND YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED IT VERY WELL AND YOU'VE GOT TO SHOOT OVER A BALL
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO SHOOT OVER AN OBJECT BALL
AND THAT'S HOW YOU SHOOT OVER A BALL
SO NOW YOU TAKE YOUR STROKES AND YOU JUST SHOOT OVER THE BALL AND YOU MAKE THE BALL IN IN THE POCKET
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO HERE JONESY'S GOING TO DO SOME MEDICINE BALL PUSH UPS WHILE RYAN IS GOING TO DO SOME PUSH UPS USING THE KETTLEBELLS JUST TO HELP THE RANGE OF MOTION IN HIS CHEST
FOR THE LONG TAIL CAST ON TAKE YOUR YARN AND GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF LENGTH TO THE SHORT END PLACE THAT OVER YOUR THUMB AND THEN THE OTHER END ATTACH TO THE BALL OVER YOUR POINTER FINGER
BANK SHOTS ARE NOT ONLY PRETTY BUT THEY'RE EFFECTIVE AND THEY'RE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE SHOT WHEN YOU USE THEM PROPERLY THAN JUST SHOOTING THE BALL AT THE RIM
SO GET ON THE BALL WITH THAT
YOU KNOW AN IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR GAME HAS GOT TO BE THE BALL HANDLING
AND WHENEVER YOU'RE DOING THAT BALL HANDLING YOU'VE GOT TO DO DRILLS AND PRACTICE IN ORDER TO GET GOOD AT IT
HI I'M TRAVIS AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU JUST HOW TO PERFECT AND GET BETTER AT BALL HANDLING IN SEVEN MINUTES A DAY
ALRIGHT THE FIRST BALL HANDLING DRILL I WANT TO SHOW YOU IS ONCE YOU HAVE THE BALL YOU WANT TO TAKE THE BALL BRING IT DOWN BELOW YOUR ANKLES START DOWN BELOW YOUR ANKLES AND GO AROUND YOUR ANKLE WAIST HEAD WAIST ANKLE WAIST HEAD WAIST ANKLE AND YOU JUST GO FASTER AND FASTER KIND OF LIKE THIS
NOW THIS IS A MEDIUM TO EASY BALL JUGGLING PATTERN WHEN YOU DO IT WITH THREE
ALL YOU'RE DOING INSTEAD OF CATCHING AND THROWING LIKE THIS YOU'RE GOING TO TURN YOUR HAND OVER AND GRAB THE BALL FROM THE TOP
BUT JUST WORK ON THAT WITH BOTH HANDS AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE ADD IT INTO YOUR THREE BALL PATTERN
WHAT JONESY'S DOING HERE IS THAT HE'S PUSHING THE BALL BACK AND FORTH
FOR A DEEPER STRETCH PULL THE BALL UP TO YOUR LEG
TOSS THE BALL
THEY THEN WILL TOSS THE BALL TO SOMEONE ELSE IN THE CIRCLE AND THEY HAVE THREE SECONDS TO COME UP WITH ANOTHER SPORT NAME
TAKE THAT RIGHT FOOT UP AND TAKE THAT STRAP AROUND THE BALL OF THE FOOT AND THEN EQUALIZE THE LENGTH OF THE STRAP AND AS YOU EQUALIZE THE LENGTH OF THE STRAP SECURE IT AROUND YOUR RIGHT HAND SO YOU HAVE A GOOD FIRM GRIP
SO BASICALLY YOU'RE GOING AROUND LIKE THIS WITH YOUR THUMBS AT THE BOTTOM AND YOUR INDEX FINGERS AT THE TOP PRESSING IN THE TOP OF THE BALL TO GIVE IT THE APPEARANCE OF A MUSHROOM CAP
ALICE MONSAERT THIS STABILITY BALL EXERCISE IS GOING TO TARGET THE OBLIQUES WHICH RUN ON THE SIDE OF THE WAIST
I'LL TAKE A KNEELING POSITION AND BEGIN TO PULL THE BALL INTO MY HIP AND PLACE THE HIP ON TOP OF THE BALL THEN LEAN OVER AND I'M JUST PLACED MY HAND AT THE SIDE AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS REDUCE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN MY RIBCAGE AND MY HIP
AND IF I CAN DROP OVER THE BALL EVEN MORE THEN I'M GETTING MORE RANGE OF MOTION AND MORE INTENSITY ON THAT MUSCLE GROUP
THEN FROM HERE I CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND STROKE THE BALL
LET'S USE THE BLUE BALL
IF YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS REVERSED AND HE'S TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE HAND OFF ON THE WRONG SIDE AND YOU HAVE YOUR ELBOW OUT THERE CHANCES ARE YOU'RE GOING TO HIT WITH YOUR ARM AND YOU'RE GOING TO KNOCK THE BALL LOOSE FROM THE QUARTERBACK
ONE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE RIGHT WAY TO WRAP UP THE BALL IF YOU TAKE THE HAND OFF IN THE WRONG WAY
THE SECOND WAY IS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER FOR THE QUARTERBACK TO GIVE YOU THE BALL IF YOU'RE NOT OPENED UP THE PROPER WAY
IT HAS TO BE OPEN SO THE QUARTERBACK CAN SLIDE THE BALL IN
HE'S STILL GOING TO USE HIS TECHNIQUE GETTING OFF THE BALL AND EVERYTHING BUT HE'S GOING TO DRAW A LINE STRAIGHT TO THAT FREE SAFETY WHICH IS CALLED STALK BLOCKING
SO BASICALLY NOW YOU'RE READY TO PRACTICE AND THROW A BALL
IF THE BALL COMES TO YOU AND YOU GOT A PERSON YOU ARE TRYING TO GO AROUND THEIR DEFENDER REMEMBER GO TO THE SIDE COME AROUND THEM OR YOU JUST CUT BACK WHATEVER
NOW IF YOU REMEMBER FROM BALL JUGGLING A MULTIPLEX IS WHEN YOU THROW MORE THAN ONE BALL AT ONCE OR IN OUR CASE MORE THAN ONE CLUB AT ONCE
THE OTHER THING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO ESPECIALLY SUCH AS WITH THIS BARREL WHERE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN PAINT A BALL HAS BROKEN IN IT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU BRING ALL THAT DEBRIS OUT
SO I'M TRYING TO PICK A HIGH POINT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE BALL AND THE HOLE
JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF HOW HARD THE BALL NEEDS TO BE MOVING HERE FOR IT TO GET TO THE HOLE
THAT MAKES IT SO THE BALL JOINT ON THE UPPER SIDE WILL BOLT IN THROUGH YOUR CONTROL ARM BUSHING HOLES
IN ORDER TO DO THAT ON A FULL SIZED VEHICLE YOUR GOING TO WANT TO GET A BALL JOINT PRESS
SO A COUPLE OF KEY POINTERS TO REMEMBER IS YOU'VE GOT YOUR NINETY DEGREE ANGLES WITH YOUR LOWER BODY YOUR SHOULDERS AND YOUR HEAD NEED TO STAY ON THE BALL
WE DON'T WANT TO BE UP HERE WHERE YOUR LOWER BACK IS ON THE BALL AS YOU ARE PUSHING UP BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO BE PUTTING A LOT OF RESTRAINT IN YOUR NECK SO AS YOU ARE SETTING UP KEEP YOUR FREE WEIGHTS DOWN BY YOUR SIDE AND YOU ARE GOING TO COME FROM A SEATED POSITION TO ROLL YOURSELF ALL THE WAY DOWN UNTIL YOU FEEL YOUR HEAD AND YOUR SHOULDERS TOUCH THE BALL
YOUR LEFT SIDE YOUR WEAKER SIDE AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WEAKER IF YOU'RE A RIGHT HANDER TRY THROWING A BALL LEFTY SEE HOW FAR IT GOES
AROUND IN A CIRCLE NICE AND CONTROL KEEPING THE BALL RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU
A THIRD THING YOU CAN DO IS YOU DO BALL TOUCHES IS STANDING ON ONE SIDE OF THE BALL
THE FIRST DRILLS THAT WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF BALL TOUCHES DIFFERENT MOVES
THE FIRST ONE IS JUST A SIMPLE BALL TOUCH RIGHT ON THE TOP OF THE BALL
THE SECOND THING YOU CAN DO WITH THIS IS YOU CAN GO AROUND THE BALL
WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU LEARN HOW TO CONTROL THE BALL AND LEARN HOW TO DRIBBLE
YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH THIS HALF BALL AND TAKE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PART OF IT AND POINT IT UPWARDS
MOST OUTDOOR ROLLER HOCKEY PLAYERS WOULD USE A BALL JUST LIKE THIS
BUT BASICALLY THE BALL MOVES REALLY WELL OUT HERE
ALRIGHT SINCE WE'RE OUTDOORS WHAT I GOT IS MY ROLLER HOCKEY BALL
SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR BALL WE'RE GOING TO CUT OFF A THIRD OF IT
SO IT GIVES YOU THE MOST OPTIONS IF YOU WANT TO GET A LOT OF LOFT ON THE BALL
SO IT'S A GREAT WEAPON AND BECAUSE IT'S SO LOFTED THOUGH IT DOES TAKE A LOT OF PRACTICE TO GET IT TO WHERE YOU HAVE GOOD CONTROL WITH IT BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE COMING UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND YOU'RE LEARNING TO POP IT UP TO A GOOD TO THE RIGHT DISTANCE SO YOU GOT TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THE SIXTY DEGREE CLUB BUT IT'S A GREAT CLUB AND LET'S SEE HOW IT GOES HERE
OK THE SIXTY DEGREE WEDGE IS REALLY LOFTED AND ONE THING I FORGOT TO MENTION IN PREVIOUS SEGMENTS MAYBE IS THAT IF YOU OPEN THE FACE OF YOUR CLUB IT DOES INCREASE THE LOFT WHICH MEANS IT PUTS THE BALL HIGHER
SO THE SIXTY DEGREE WEDGE IS ANOTHER WAY OF LOFTING THE BALL HIGH SO WHEN IT LANDS IT STOPS
THERE YOU HAVE IT SEVEN MINUTES BALL HANDLING
THE NEXT ONE WILL BE PROBABLY FIGURE EIGHT DRIBBLE WHICH TAKE THE BALL DRIBBLE BETWEEN YOUR LEGS IN THE SAME MOTION
TRY THAT THIRTY SECONDS ONE WAY AND THIRTY SECONDS AGAIN FOR THE FINISH UP REP AND THE LAST ONE YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO TRY AND JUST GET ONE ONE BALL MAYBE HAVE A DEFENSIVE MAN AND WORK ON SIMPLY DRIBBLING
SO AND THEN MAKE SURE TO DRAW THE LITTLE BUNNY TAIL POOF BALL POMPOM
IT THE SAME THING IN GOLF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE GOLF BALL AS YOU FOLLOW THROUGH IT AND NOT LOOK UP UNTIL YOUR SHOULDER FORCES YOU TO LOOK UP
YOU SHOULD KNOW THE FASTER THE CLUBBING SPEED THE EASIER IT IS TO GET THAT BALL UP IN THE AIR
AND BASICALLY THE REASON BEHIND THAT IS YOU ARE PUTTING SPIN ON THE GOLF BALL
GO AHEAD AND SWITCH SIDES POST YOUR FOOT IN THE CENTER OF THE BALANCE TRAINER WITH BOTH HANDS ON THE MEDICINE BALL BODY IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION AND YOU ARE GOING TO PUSH FORWARD INSTEAD OF BACK
WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO IS SIT BACK IN A SIDE SQUAT POSITION AND PUSH YOUR BALANCE AND YOUR MEDICINE BALL FORWARD
RELAX YOUR SHOULDERS AND KEEP YOUR HEAD NICE AND LEVEL AND EXHALE AS YOU PUSH THE BALL AWAY FROM YOU
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS COME INTO A NICE EVEN ANGLE WITH YOUR BALANCE TRAINER PLACE ONE FOOT AND TRY TO KEEP IT FAIRLY BALANCED IN THE CENTER OF YOUR BALANCE TRAINER BOTH HANDS ON YOUR MEDICINE BALL
EXHALE AS THE BALL GOES FORWARD AND INHALE ON THE WAY BACK
I'VE SEEN SOME THAT WERE JUST REAL TINY A LITTLE BALL OF THE ARTIFICIAL FIREWOOD
AS YOU BRING THE BALL DOWN THE FLOOR YOU'VE GOT TO GO AGGRESSIVELY TO TRY TO SCORE
NUMBER ONE REVERSE THE BALL IT'S THE KEY TO ANY PRESS BREAK
NOW WE ARE GOING TO DO A DIFFERENT SERVE WHICH IS THE WIDE SERVE SO MY GOAL IS TO HIT THE BALL SOMEWHERE ABOVE MY RACQUET TO NEAR THE RED LINE AND THE REASON BEING WHEN THE BALL HITS IN THAT AREA THE OPPONENT DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF A SHOT
HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THE BALL OFF THE WALL OR HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET IT BEFORE IT HITS THE WALL SO IF I HIT IT JUST RIGHT HE IS GOING TO HAVE A VERY VERY WEAK SHOT
SO BY HITTING THE BALL UP HERE MY OPPONENT IS FORCED TO TAKE THE BALL HIGH WITH HIS BACK HAND OR HE HAS TO TAKE THE RISK OF LETTING IT COME OFF THE BACK WALL OR DYING BACK HERE SO THIS IS A VERY VERY EFFECTIVE SHOT SO ONCE YOU HAVE MASTERED THE TECHNICAL SKILLS OF JUST HITTING THE BALL IN A DECENT MANNER YOU WANT TO START INCORPORATING HITTING IT TO SPOTS ON THE SIDE OF THE WALL TO MAKE YOUR SERVE THAT MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE
RIGHT LIKE THAT SO BY KEEPING THE BALL AT THAT PART OF THE WALL THEY CAN'T ATTACK ME VERY MUCH SO I'LL USE THE BIG BALL
MED BALL CHEST PASS
AS YOU REPEAT THIS EXERCISE AND COME HERE YOUR MUSCLE MEMORY IS GOING TO START DEVELOPING THE HABIT OF HITTING DOWN AND KEEPING THE HANDS AHEAD OF THE CLUB AND IS GOING TO HELP YOU GET A MUCH BETTER CONTACT WITH THE GOLF BALL
MANY TIMES WE SEE AMATEURS JUST HITTING UP ON THE BALL AND HITTING WHERE THE CLUB FACE IS AHEAD OF THE HANDS AND THE WEIGHT REMAINS INTO YOUR BACK LEG YOUR RIGHT LEG FOR RIGHT HANDED PLAYERS
THIS IMPACT BAG IS REALLY GOING TO TEACH YOU THE HABIT OF COMING TO THE CORRECT IMPACT POSITION AND IF YOU NOTICE HERE MY WEIGHT IS WAILING TO MY LEFT SIDE THE CLUB FACE IS BEHIND MY HANDS SO MY HANDS ARE HEAD AND IN THIS POSITION I AM ABLE TO HIT DOWN ON THE BALL
SO SOMETIMES IF YOU HOLD ANYTHING SOMETIMES A BOWLING BALL THE BALL THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE
GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT AROUND THE BLOCK TO VERIFY YOUR BALL JOINT REPLACEMENT
SO THINK ABOUT TUCKING THAT RIBCAGE DOWN SQUEEZING UP WITH THE GLUTES AND THE HAMSTRINGS FINDING YOURSELF STABLE ON THE BALL EXTENDING THE ARMS OVER
SO HOLD ON TO THE BALL AS YOU SLOWLY WALK YOURSELF OUT
AGAIN IN THIS POSITION YOU WANT TO LET GET YOUR HEAD RESTING ON THE BALL AND NOT LET YOUR HIPS SAG SO YOU'RE GOING TO USE THE GLUTES TO CONTRACT TO LIFT THE HIPS AND HAVE YOUR HEAD IN LINE WITH YOUR SPINE
AND WORK ON GETTING THE BALL OUT OF THE GLOVE QUICK FOUR SEAM GRIP
THAT IS GOING TO HELP YOU STRONGLY RECOVER BACK AND ALSO BE ABLE TO HELP YOU ATTACK THE BALL
SEE HOW WIDE HIS FEET ARE AFTER HE HITS THE BALL AND THEN HE COMES BACK AROUND THERE
I'M GOING TO SET MY TOOL DOWN AND GRAB MY NEW BALL JOINT AND SHOW YOU THE TAPER ON IT
YOUR GOING TO TAKE AND SLIP IT BETWEEN YOUR SPINDLE AND YOUR BALL JOINT AND HAMMER IT INTO POSITION
THE WAY THIS IS DESIGNED AND I'LL SHOW YOU ON MY NEW BALL JOINT HERE IN A SECOND IS IT IS A CONCAVE HERE ON THIS SIDE AND A CONVEX ON THIS SIDE
IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE PROPER METHOD FOR BREAKING THE MECHANICAL WELD BETWEEN YOUR BALL JOINT AND YOUR SPINDLE
IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CORRECT PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZE VEHICLE
THERE IS NO OTHER SPEED BALL COURSE OR MOGUL'S COURSE LIKE IT THAT WE CAN FIND ANYWHERE AND ONCE IT IS FINISHED IT WILL BE PROBABLY THE HARDEST COURSE IN CENTRAL TEXAS TO PLAY
JUST USE A BALL THAT YOU HAVE AT HOME GO TO YOUR KIDS ROOM GO TO THE TOY BOX AND CHOOSE AN EASY BALL AND YOU WOULD LIKE TO LINE THE GUEST OF THE PARTY IN A CIRCLE
THAT IS THE PROPER WAY TO SEAT YOUR PICKLE FORK AND BREAK THE MECHANICAL WELD BETWEEN THE SPINDLE AND THE BALL JOINT
RIGHT THERE THE MECHANICAL WELD HAS BEEN BROKEN AS YOU CAN SEE OUR UPPER BALL JOINT IS NOW FREE AND WE'RE READY TO CONTINUE WITH THE REST OF THE DISASSEMBLING PROCEDURE
A LOT OF TIMES THAT COMES FROM A GUY EITHER NOT LISTENING TO THE CADENCE HE'S NOT WATCHING THE BALL OR HE'S TOO FAR FROM THE BALL AND MAKES A MISTAKE BY JUMPING OFF SIDES PREMATURELY
THERE CAN BE AN OFF SIDES PENALTY AGAINST THE CENTER FOR MOVING OR MANIPULATING THE BALL TO THROW OFF THE DEFENSE
WHEN HE GOES DOWN ON THE BALL HE HAS TO GET SET
THE BALL WILL BE LAYING ON THE GROUND AND MAY BE TURNED TO THE SIDE
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN OUR CENTER GOES DOWN TO SNAP THE BALL THAT WE DON'T GET ANY PENALTIES
HE'S ALLOWED TO GRAB THE BALL TO GET IT SET BUT ONCE HE GETS THAT BALL SET HE CAN'T MOVE IT
THEY ARE NOT ASYMMETRICAL AS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT HERE NEXT TO THE BALL JOINT GREASE BOOT THERE IS AN L
IT'S NOT JUST BATTING A BALL BACK AND FORTH
AND NOW I AM THE PROPER DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE BALL
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO GO LIFTING YOUR HEELS UP LIKE THIS BUT YOU WANT TO FEEL THE PRESSURE OKAY ON THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT
SO GETTING THE GRIP RIGHT WILL ALLOW YOU TO HIT A BALL NICELY BUT A POOR GRIP WILL GIVE YOU ALL TYPES OF COMPENSATIONS BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT IS
AFTER THAT WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE GAMES WE ARE GOING TO PLAY LIKE EIGHT BALL NINE BALL ROTATION CUT THROAT AND CARNEY BALL AND FINALLY I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME FUN TRICK SHOTS THAT YOU CAN PLAY ON YOUR FRIENDS TO SHOW THEM THAT YOU HAVE MORE SKILL THAN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE
FOR EXAMPLE HOW TO PICK OUT A CUE HOW TO HOLD THE CUE HOW TO MAKE A BRIDGE SO THE CUE CAN HIT THE CUE BALL HOW TO HIT THE CUE BALL DIFFERENT ENGLISH FOR THE CUE BALL
THERE'S A STRAIGHT END SHOT THERE'S THE BANK SHOT THERE'S THE KICK SHOT THERE'S THE COMBINATION SHOT THERE'S A SHOT OFF ONE BALL THERE'S A SNOOKER SHOT THERE'S A SAFETY SHOT AND THEN THERE'S A SCRATCH SHOT
JUST LIKE THE THREE BALL MULTIPLEX START IT'S A COOL WAY TO START
THE FOUR BALL SIDE BY SIDE MULTIPLEX START
I JUST PINCHED A SMALL AMOUNT OF CLAY OFF OF MY CLAY AND ROLLED IT INTO A BALL AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE TO MAKE THE KNOB
PEOPLE USE IT A LOT FOR DIFFERENT THREE BALL PATTERNS
ROLL UP THAT BALL AGAIN
AND ON A FAST CLOTH LIKE THIS IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE HIT RIGHT IN THE CENTER AND SLIDE ALL THE WAY OVER TO THAT BALL AND STOP
SO I'LL FILL UP ONE CUP WORTH OF WATER IN MY MUG AND THEN SUBMERGE THE DIFFUSING BALL INSIDE THE CUP
SO SINCE IT'S GREEN TEA WE'RE GOING TO LET IT SIT FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES AND WHEN WE'RE FINISHED PULL OUT THE BALL GIVE IT A FEW SECONDS TO DRAIN
SO MY OBJECTIVE NOW IS TO COME OVER HERE WITH THE ANGLE THAT I NEED TO THEN KICK THE BALL INTO THIS POCKET
SO LET'S SAY THE BALL IS UP LIKE ON THIS
NOW WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE TWIST JUST LIKE YOU HAVE AN AX AND YOU'RE CHOPPING WOOD YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE SAME THING WITH THE BALL AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME ACROSS THE BODY
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET A GOOD FEEL FOR THE BALL SO YOU TIP THE BALL BACK AND FORTH RAISE IT UP HIGHER AND HIGHER
NEXT DRILL WILL BE FOR BALL HANDLING ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF BALL HANDLING IS DRIBBLING
HE GETS LOW AND HE HITS THE BALL HIGH OFF THE FRONT WALL
SO SEE HOW HE GETS UNDERNEATH THE BALL
THE TOSS IS THE HARDEST AND THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE SERVE AND BASICALLY WHAT YOU DO ON THE TOSS YOU ARE THROWING THE BALL RIGHT WHERE YOU NEED IT TO BE IN ORDER TO HIT THE SHOT
NEXT IS THE CAPTIVE BEAD AND THE CAPTIVE BEAD IS A SMALL HOOP WITH THE BALL SUSPENDED SIX DAYS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND THE BALL POPS RIGHT OUT AND SHOULD POP RIGHT BACK IN LIKE THIS
THIS IS JUST A FLAT BACK STUD WITH A BALL THAT SCREWS ON AND OFF
