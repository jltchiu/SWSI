THE GOAL IS TO GO OVER THE ENTIRE BOTTOM OF THE TANK BEFORE THE WATER LEVEL DRAINS MORE THAN A THIRD TO A HALF WAY
THAT'LL TAKE SOME TIME BUT IT GIVES YOU A GOAL
MY GOAL IS TO STRIKE THIS HERE
LEADERBOARD TOURNAMENT STYSTEM'S MAIN GOAL IS TO MAKE YOUR SPONSORS AND YOUR PLAYERS FEEL EXCITED ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE SO THEY COME BACK NEXT YEAR
WHEN WE MAKE A BEAD WE'RE INTRODUCING LOTS OF FOCUSED HEAT INTO ONE PARTICULAR AND OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE THAT NOT BE SO LOCALIZED
IF YOUR CAT IS COMFORTABLE WITH THAT LITTLE HOLE WHICH IS A BIG STOPPING POINT FOR A LOT OF CATS THEN YOU CAN START MAKING THE HOLE A LITTLE BIGGER A LITTLE BIGGER A LITTLE BIGGER AND BASICALLY THE IDEA IS AND YOU CAN USE A LITTLE PICK UP SOMETHING AT THE HARDWARE STORE TO LINE THE INSIDE OF THE HOLE SO THE LITTER DOESN'T FALL RIGHT THROUGH BUT AS IT GETS BIGGER AND BIGGER THE GOAL IS TO GET IT BIG ENOUGH SO THAT THERE IS JUST A LITTLE BIT OF LITTER ON THE OUTSIDE AND THEN THERE IS NO LITTER AT ALL
HIS GOAL IS TO HIT IT RIGHT ABOVE THE TEN EITHER REAL SOFT SO IT JUST COMES OUT AS A WINNING DROP SHOT OR HE'S GOING TO ATTACK THE NECK
TWO POUNDS A WEEK IS AN EXCELLENT GOAL
THAT WILL BE OUR GOAL
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN THE GOAL TO BE HITTING BEFORE THEY BEGIN EXTENDING THEIR ARM
SO THEY SIT THEM DOWN AND THEY NORMALLY HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH THEM WHERE THEY BASICALLY ASK THE PERSON WHAT THEY WANT THEIR GOALS TO BE THEIR HEALTH THEIR PAST HISTORY WITH EXERCISE SO THAT THEY MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM THAT THEY SET UP FOR THEM IS GOING TO HELP THEM BE SUCCESSFUL AND THEY'RE GOING TO HIT THEIR GOAL
THAT'S MY GOAL WITH THIS RIFF
SO IF YOU GO AND GET THING ABOUT GETTING IN THE ACADEMY START RUNNING START WHETHER IT'S LIFTING OR PUSH UPS SIT UPS JUST GET INTO SHAPE BECAUSE OUR MAIN GOAL IS TO IS THAT OFFICERS GO HOME AND IF YOU ARE IN SHAPE THAT'S A BETTER RISK THAT YOU ARE GOING TO GO HOME OR A BETTER CHANCE THAT YOU'RE GOING HOME AND NOT HAVE TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL OR THINGS LIKE THAT
SO WITH A BICEP CURL YOUR GOAL IS TO WORK THE TWO-HEADED MUSCLE IN THE FRONT PART OF THE ARM
THE GOAL OF THE TUNNEL WILL BE TO HAVE YOUR DOG BE BALANCED WITH SPEED AND MOVEMENT TO GET THROUGH THE TUNNEL AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
REASON BEING IS SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT HAVE THE BALL AND ANOTHER TEAM MIGHT FOUL YOU BUT YOU MIGHT STILL MAINTAIN POSSESSION OF THE BALL OR A TEAMMATE MIGHT POSSESS THE BALL AND GIVE YOURSELF A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SCORE A GOAL
IT IS IMPORTANT TO START WITH YOUR GOAL TO BE LOW AND THEN KIND OF WORK YOUR WAY HIGHER AND HIGHER DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN DO
ONCE WE GET THAT GUY BACK AWAY FROM THE BASKET THAT'S WHEN OUR EYES ARE GOING TO PICK UP THE GOAL AND NOT UNTIL THEN
THE OBJECT OF SOCCER IS TO POSSES THE BALL AND WORK IT DOWN THE FIELD IN ORDER TO SCORE A GOAL
THE GOAL OF THE GAME IS TO GET RID OF YOUR STOCKPILE BEFORE ANYONE ELSE SO WHEN YOU START YOUR TURN YOU TURN OVER THE FIRST CARD ON YOUR STOCKPILE
THE GOAL IS TO STAY ENGAGED AS YOU LENGTHEN AS YOU REACH YOU'LL BE FEELING THIS IN THE OBLIQUE AND THROUGH YOUR LOWER BACK
SO FIRST THIRTY DAYS OUR GOAL IS GOING TO BE BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTEEN POUNDS
AS WE GET CLOSER TO OUR GOAL WEIGHT IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CHALLENGING SO YOU'LL SEE THE GOAL REDUCE ACTUALLY AS THE PLAN MOVES FORWARD
BY THE END OF SIXTY DAYS WE'VE LOST AN ADDITIONAL TEN TO TWELVE BY NINETY DAYS WE'VE LOST AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT TO TEN AND THEN BY THE TIME YOU'VE HIT THAT GOAL IN FOUR MONTHS YOU'LL BE UP TO YOUR GOAL WEIGHT AND YOU'LL HAVE LOST THE BALANCE OF POUNDS THAT YOU NEED TO LOSE
SO HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GOAL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NET AND ITS PURPOSE
ONE THING THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PART TO ACTUALLY PLAYING BASKETBALL IS THE GOAL
NOW WHEN I AM WALKING THROUGH THE CROWD MY GOAL HERE IS FOR BEAR ITS OK FOR HIM TO SNIFF A LITTLE BIT BUT THAT'S A SNIFF
BUT YOUR GOAL IS TO KEEP THAT WRIST IN NEUTRAL AND JUST CURL IT UP TO PEEK CONTRACTION AND OF COURSE WITH BREATH EXHALE ON THE CONTRACTION SLIGHT BEND IN THE KNEES BECAUSE WE WANT TO TAKE THE LOWER BACK OUT OF THE PICTURE
IF YOUR GOAL IS TO GAIN MUSCLE AND MASS YOU ARE ONLY GOING TO WANT TO DO CARDIO ABOUT ONE TIME WEEK BECAUSE IF YOU DO TOO MUCH CARDIO IT COULD ACTUALLY TEAR DOWN THE MUSCLE AND MAKE THE MUSCLE GROUP SMALLER SO IF YOUR GOAL IS TO BUILD MASS YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO DO MORE WEIGHT TRAINING THAN YOU ARE CARDIOVASCULAR TRAINING
IF YOUR GOAL IS TO GET LEAN THAT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORY TRY TO DO ABOUT FIVE TO SIX DAYS A WEEK ABOUT THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES SESSIONS AND YOU WANT TO TRY TO PUSH YOURSELF BETWEEN THE 75 AND EIGHTY PERCENTILE OF YOUR MAXIMUM HEART RATE SO A GOOD THING TO DO IS TO HECK THE HEART RATE ON THE MONITORS THAT ARE ON THE EQUIPMENT THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR LOCAL GYM
IF YOU'RE SHOOTING AT A GOAL YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO WEAR PROPER EQUIPMENT OR EVEN CHIN GUARDS FOR THE PLAYERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
SO YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND WRAP THEM CAREFULLY IN A LOOSE COIL LIKE THIS AND YOUR GOAL IS TO KINDA TUCK ALL THOSE SHARP ENDS YOU KNOW TOWARDS THE INSIDE
NOW WE ARE GOING TO DO A DIFFERENT SERVE WHICH IS THE WIDE SERVE SO MY GOAL IS TO HIT THE BALL SOMEWHERE ABOVE MY RACQUET TO NEAR THE RED LINE AND THE REASON BEING WHEN THE BALL HITS IN THAT AREA THE OPPONENT DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF A SHOT
