YOU CAN HAVE MORE OR LESS DEPENDING ON YOUR TASTE
JUST GOING TO GRAB OUR CUTTER CUT THIS ONE IN HALF MAKE IT TWO SAME THING WITH THIS ONE LOOK HOW CRUNCHY THAT BREAD IS WAIT TILL YOU TASTE HOW GREAT THAT BREAD IS GOING TO BE
SO AS YOU TASTE IT I'VE ALSO LEARNED IN THE KITCHEN IT'S ALWAYS BETTER TO HAVE TO ADD SOMETHING THAN TO HAVE TO TAKE IT AWAY IF YOU PUT TOO MUCH
LET'S GO OVER TO OUR DISH BUT RIGHT BEFORE I'M ABOUT TO SERVE YOU SEE IT'S ON A NICE SLOW FLAME I'M JUST GOING TO ADD THIS FRESH PARSLEY JUST TO GIVE IT SOME TASTE
A LITTLE FRESH PARSLEY FOR TASTE
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE A REALLY PERFECT ESPRESSO WHEN YOU HAVE DRINKS THAT DON'T HAVE CREAMED MILK OR ANY SYRUPS IN IT BECAUSE YOU ARE REALLY GOING TO TASTE THE ESPRESSO
YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO SEE IT BUT YOU'LL DEFINITELY BE ABLE TO TASTE IT
ANOTHER STEP OF WINE TASTING IS LOOKING AT A WINE FOR BUBBLES AND EVERYBODY KNOWS A SPARKLING WINE HAS BUBBLES AND THEY'RE EASY TO SEE AND THEY'RE FUN TO TASTE
AND ADD A LITTLE HONEY TO GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE TASTE
I'LL GIVE A TASTE OF IT
I ALWAYS KIND OF COOK WITH MY MOUTH AND TO TASTE IT AS I GO ALONG
CAN YOU TASTE THEM
NOW REALIZE THAT PASTE IS ALSO VERY STRONG STRAIGHT PASTE YOU'LL ONLY GOING TO WANT TO GO WITH ONE OR TWO TEASPOONS THEN TASTE AND ADD MORE IF YOU LIKE IT
I CAN TASTE IT NOW
BUT YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO TAKE ON THE TASTE OF THE FRESH HERBS
I AM ONLY GOING TO PUT 3/4 OF A POURER BECAUSE IF YOU PUT TOO MUCH WATER IT IS GOING TO TASTE DILUTED
YOU WANT TO WAIT UNTIL THE VERY LAST MINUTE THEN YOU WANT TO TASTE
IT IS SO STRONG AND IT TASTE SO GOOD
HIGH MOUNTAIN TEA LIKE THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT BOLD AND OVER COMING AND BITTER IN THE INITIAL TASTE BUT THEN THE AFTER TASTE IS GOING TO BE SWEET
SO THE OLD TEA DRINKERS IN TAIWAN THEY PREFER A TEA THAT IS THAT HAS THOSE CHARACTERISTICS THAT'S OFTEN BOLD AND VERY STRONG AND ALMOST A LITTLE BIT BITTER IN THE INITIAL TASTE BUT THEN THE AFTER TASTE IS SWEET AND THAT'S WHAT THEY LOOK FOR IN A HIGH MOUNTAIN TEA LIKE THIS
IT'S STILL GOING TO TASTE THE SAME
I'M JUST GOING TO ADD ANOTHER TWO TEASPOONS AND MIX THAT IN AND I'M GOING TO TASTE IT
SO YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST A QUESTION OF TASTE
TODAY I WAS USING A SAUCE JUST TRYING TO TASTE YOU KNOW IF THERE WILL BE A DIFFERENCE OR HOW SIMILAR
I GREW UP ON TEXAS WELL WATER SO I DON'T EVEN TASTE IT BUT IT BOTHERS A LOT OF PEOPLE SO THEY CAN USE THE BLEACH AND THE BLEACH TABLETS ACTUALLY MAKE YOUR WATER TASTE SUPER SUPER CHLORINATED WHICH I CAN'T STAND BUT IF YOU CAN'T STAND EITHER OF THOSE TASTES WHAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO IS JUST BRING GATORADE PACKETS AND THAT WILL ALSO HELP YOU REPLENISH THE SALT AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEED FOR THE DAY AND IT WILL MASK THE NASTY TASTES OF THE IODINE THAT IS ALSO PUMPING THROUGH FILTERS BUT IT IS NOT AS THOROUGH AND YOU REALLY SHOULD USE THE IODINE TABLETS OR THE BLEACH ON TOP OF PUMPING IT THROUGH A FILTER
IODINE TABLETS TASTE OR THE IODINE WATER AFTER YOU MAKE IT IT TASTES KIND OF LIKE RUSTY PIPE WATER BASICALLY
I MEAN IT WOULD PROBABLY STILL TASTE GOOD BUT YOU NEVER KNOW
I FIND THAT WHENEVER YOU'RE MIXING A TEQUILA WITH A JUICE IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT KIND YOU USE BECAUSE THE JUICE IS GOING TO OVERPOWER MOST OF THE TASTE OF THE TEQUILA ANYWAYS
WE SHOULD HAVE A BITTERSWEET TASTE TO THIS WITH THE GRAPEFRUIT JUICE BUT THE TEQUILA'S GOING TO HAVE A NICE BIT OF CONTROL OVER THE BITTERNESS OF THAT GRAPEFRUIT JUICE
TONIC WATER AND CLUB SODA TASTE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT SO YOU JUST WANT TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO DO THAT
IT MIGHT TASTE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT MORE THAN NOT IT'LL TASTE OKAY
THESE BOTH BOTH OF THESE ARE TEND TO BE USED IN MORE OF TROPICAL DRINKS OR CARIBBEAN TYPE DRINKS AND AGAIN IF IT'S MIXED WITH A SEVERAL OTHER INGREDIENTS YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO NOTICE THE TASTE THAT MUCH
ALRIGHT NOW IT'S TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHEN TO TAKE THE WINE WHEN IS IT READY TO PUT IN THE BOTTLES AND POSSIBLY EVEN TAKE A TASTE AND SEE IF IT'S READY
OOLONG TEA IS THE HIGHEST HAS THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF POLYPHENOL SO IT'S A VERY GOOD TEA TO DRINK FOR ONE FLAVOR AND TWO IT HAS THE ADDED HEALTH BENEFITS OF THESE ANTIOXIDANTS THIS TEA IS REALLY A CONDUIT FOR US TO TASTE THIS EARTH
BUT WHERE I USED TO ONLY USE LIKE TWO OR THREE OF THE DRY WASABI TWO OR THREE TEASPOONS I HAD TO PUT IN LIKE SIX TO EIGHT TEASPOONS TO REALLY TASTE THE WASABI
AND YOU'LL KNOW BY YOUR EAR IF IT'S IN TIME WITH THE BEAT AND ALSO TO YOUR OWN TASTE OF HOW YOU WANT TO MANIPULATE THE WAH EFFECT
FOR MY TASTE THIS SHOULD BE A LITTLE LOWER WHICH I WILL ADJUST A LITTLE LATER ON
IT'S REALLY TO TASTE
AND REALLY THE ICING IS TO TASTE
SO IF YOU REALLY LIKE SUGARY YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE JUST A SUGAR-HOLIC GO AHEAD AND TASTE
SO JUST PUT A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME AND TASTE IT UNTIL IT IS THE RIGHT TASTE THAT YOU WANT IT TO BE
NOW THERE IS NO CERTAIN OUNCE THAT YOU NEED TO PUT IN THERE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO THAT ACCORDING TO TASTE
SO GO AHEAD AND GRAB YOUR PEPPER AND JUST PUT A LITTLE BIT IN THERE NOT TOO MUCH WE DON'T WANT THIS TO OVERWHELM THE TASTE AND THEN DO THE SAME THING WITH THE SALT
AND WHAT I LIKE TO SAY IS IT NOW BY THE TIME YOU TASTE THE SAKE FROM ARRIVAL TO YOUR WINE SHOP OR TO YOUR RESTAURANT IT MAY BE ANOTHER THIRTY DAYS
WITH THE COFFEE TABLE IS REALLY FINE IF FOR 100 %PERCENT CONTEMPORARY PERSON YOU JUST TAKE AWAY OR ADD TO TO WHAT YOUR TASTE IS
REPASADO IS THE IDEAL TEQUILA YOU WANT TO USE BUT THE FACT IS IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER AS FAR AS TASTE GOES
IT DEPENDS ON YOUR TASTE
YOU CAN TASTE THE CELERY YOU CAN TASTE THE CARROTS
WITH BLACK TEA YOU SHOULD NOT LET IT BREW FOR TOO LONG WE'RE SO USED TO TEABAGS BECAUSE WITH TEABAGS YOU CAN LET IT SIT FOR AN HOUR TWO HOURS FOR THE WHOLE DAY AND YOU'LL GET A STRONG CUP BUT IT BASICALLY WILL TASTE THE SAME
IT WON'T TASTE EXACTLY ALIKE BUT IT'LL BE ENOUGH THE DRINK WILL STILL TASTE GOOD
FOR PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE WHOEVER YOU'RE MAKING THIS FOR WHETHER IT'D BE FOR YOURSELF OR FOR FAMILY OR FRIENDS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT PEOPLE BEING LOVING FISH OR WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE BIG FISH EATERS BECAUSE THE TASTE IS VERY VERY MILD ON THE TILAPIA
AND I LIKE TO RINSE MY ICE SO THAT IT DOESN'T TASTE LIKE WHATEVER'S BEEN IN MY FREEZER FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS
IF YOU PLANT THIS IDEA AT HOME THAT MAKING FOOD TOGETHER CAN BE FUN AND THEY GET TO TASTE THESE NATURAL TASTES THEY WON'T LIKE THE ARTIFICIALLY SWEETENED OR REFINED OR THOSE FOODS THAT FULL WITH REFINED SUGAR BECAUSE IT WILL BE TOO MUCH FOR THEIR BODIES
IF THE SAUCE DOESN'T TASTE GOOD TO YOU AT FIRST YOU WANT TO WAIT
SEE IF YOU SEE SOME BUBBLES BEFORE YOU TASTE THAT WINE
A LITTLE BIT OF CARBON DIOXIDE WILL MAKE A WINE TASTE FRESH AND INTERESTING AND WILL MOVE THE WINE AROUND IN YOUR MOUTH TO ALLOW YOU TO TASTE MORE AND MORE OF IT
IF YOU'VE EVER TASTED FLAT COKE I HOPE IT WAS AN ACCIDENT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE FLAT COKE DOESN'T TASTE GOOD AT ALL
THEY'LL TASTE IT AND GO WHAT'S THAT AND THAT'S IT
