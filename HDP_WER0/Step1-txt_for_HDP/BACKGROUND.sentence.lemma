WE JUST SET THE BACKGROUND TO BACK INSIDE FLASH AND THEN WE HAVE THIS PURPLE OUTWORK THAT I CREATED ON TOP SO THAT IS THE ONLY ONE THAT I WOULD BRING IT AND OF COURSE I NAMED IT BACKGROUND ART
I LIKE TO START OFF WITH THE BACKGROUND FIRST WE WOULD TURN OFF THESE LAYERS
NOW THE BACKGROUND IS ONLY TWO LAYERS AND THIS BLACK BACK THAT I HAVE IS THE ONLY LAYER THAT I WON'T IMPORT INTO FLASH
AND AGAIN AS I SAID ON SOME OF THOSE PAINTINGS WE SOFTEN THE BACKGROUND BY DABBING IT WITH KLEENEX
IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO LIGHT A PIECE OF PLEXI-GLASS FROM BELOW TO ACHIEVE A WHITE BACKGROUND FOR A PIECE OF JEWELRY
IF I COME DOWN HERE TO STYLE ATTRIBUTES I CAN CHANGE THE BACKGROUND COLOR
SO IT WOULD BE A BACKGROUND LIGHT
LET US ADD ANOTHER LIGHT JUST TO DEAL WITH THE BACKGROUND
THEN YOU WANT TO HAVE WHATS CALLED A HAIR LIGHT THAT WILL BE AIMED AT THE BACK OF THE MODELS HEAD SO THAT THEIR HAIR STANDS OUT FROM THE BACKGROUND AND SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THE DEPTH OF THEIR HEAD ACTUALLY
AND OF COURSE YOU WANT TO HAVE ONE OR TWO LIGHTS ON THE BACKGROUND SO THAT THE MODEL STANDS OUT FROM THE BACKGROUND AND IS DEFINED AGAINST THE BACKGROUND AND YOU CAN DO SOMETHING INTERESTING AS WELL YOU CAN PUT A GEL ON THAT TO MAKE IT A DIFFERENT COLOR OR YOU CAN PUT A TEXTURED FABRIC UP ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING AND GIVE THE EFFECT THAT YOU WANT TO GIVE
YOU ARE GOING TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND INFO ON THE CONCERT 440
NOW YOU SEE HOW THE BACK LIGHT CUTS ME OUT OF THE BACKGROUND
WHAT WAS THEIR RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND
AND LET'S SELECT OUR BACKGROUND COLOR LIKE SO
NOW WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS TAKE THE RECTANGULAR MARQUEE TOOL AND JUST GRAB A SMALL PORTION OF THAT PICTURE JUST BY GOING CREATING THE MARQUEE AND THEN GOING EDIT COPY AND THEN GO AHEAD AND CLOSE THAT IMAGE AND PASTE IT EDIT PASTE RIGHT INTO OUR BACKGROUND PICTURE
NOW THAT I'VE CREATED MY BACKGROUND IMAGE WE'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO SAVE THE FILE
AND SO IF YOU SEE RIGHT HERE IN PHOTOSHOP I'VE CREATED THIS YELLOW POLKA DOT IN A WHITE BACKGROUND IT'S FABULOUS AND I'M GOING TO GO UP HERE AND GO FILE AND BOTH PHOTOSHOP AND ILLUSTRATOR HAVE THIS GREAT LITTLE FEATURE CALLED SAVE TO WEB AND THAT WILL AUTOMATICALLY KIND OF JUST LIST OUT THE OPTIONS
NOW YOU'LL NOTICE THAT OFF TO THE SIDES HERE WE HAVE QUITE A BIT OF WHITE SPACE AND OF COURSE WE HAD THAT GREEN BACKGROUND
LIGHT EXTRACT WILL PROVIDE A MALTY BACKGROUND
SO IT'S CRITICAL TO TRY AND BACK LIGHT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET A PURE WHITE BACKGROUND.THE WAY OF DOING THAT I THINK THE BEST WAY OF DOING THAT IS A PIECE OF A CLEAR WHITE PLEXI-GLASS THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW THE LIGHT TO COME THROUGH AND GIVES YOU THAT WHITE BACKGROUND WITHOUT OVER-EXPOSING THE JEWELRY ITSELF
AFFECTION IS A REAL KEY BUT IT DOESN'T FILL SOME OF THESE FUNDAMENTAL VOIDS THAT A PERSON MAY BE HAVING IN THEIR BACKGROUND SO YOU REALLY NEED TO SET THE PARAMETERS FOR YOUR RELATIONSHIP
SO WE HAVE THIS BACKGROUND HERE CLOSE THE DOOR AND SINCE I HAVE A TRIPOD I'M GOING TO HAVE THE CAMERA ON THE TRIPOD
IT IS A SORT OF A BITTER SWEET AND IT IS A BACKGROUND TO ALL OF THIS ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL INGREDIENTS THAT WE HAVE PUT IN
I'M SHOOTING MY MODEL ALEX FROM A LOWER LEVEL AND THIS WAY I'VE GOT THE SKYLINE OF MANHATTAN IN THE BACKGROUND SHE LOOKS QUITE A BIT TALLER AND IT JUST GIVES YOU A DIFFERENT LOOK WITH YOUR SHOOT
ON BOTH OF THEM YOU'LL NOTICE THE BACKGROUND HAS BEEN SOFTENED BY USING KLEENEX TO DAB THE WAX WHEN IT WAS ON THE PANCAKE GRIDDLE
SO THOSE ARE SOME EXAMPLES HERE'S ANOTHER ONE THAT'S A LITTLE MORE UNUSUAL YOUR GOING TO FIND THAT THERE'S MORE GREEN AND WHITE BACKGROUND TO THIS WITH A LEAF VINE ON IT
SO LET US DEAL WITH THE BACKGROUND A LITTLE BIT MORE
SO THE BACKGROUND WOULD BE THIS AND THAT WILL CREATE A NICE BACKGROUND LOTS OF VEGETATION NOTHING UGLY SO THAT SHOULD BE NICE AND THE SUN'S BEHIND ME
HERE'S A HERE'S A BACKGROUND TEXTURE THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING
WE'RE JUST GOING TO CREATE A PAGE FOR A SCRAPBOOK AND LET'S START WITH THE BACKGROUND
ALL RIGHT NOW AS WE PUSH BACK IN YOU KNOW WITHIN OUR BACKGROUND YOU CAN SEE HOW IT BUILDS UP
OKAY YOU SEE HOW I FALL FLAT AND BECOME PART OF THE BACKGROUND
YOU KNOW I CAN PUT THE BROWN HERE BUT THAT'S THE ONE THAT YOU SEE FIRST AND THEN THE BACKGROUND OF THAT I PUT THIS KIND OF MUSTARD COLOR HERE
AS A CHEERLEADER IT'S IMPORTANT TO DEFINITELY HAVE SOME GYMNASTICS BACKGROUND IN YOUR TRAINING
AS WELL AS A LITTLE BACKGROUND INFO AS FAR AS HOW THAT IS INVOLVED
IF YOU COME DOWN HERE YOU CAN CHANGE THE FILL COLOR OF THE BACKGROUND
SIMCOE IS A VERY HIGH ALPHA ACID HOP WHICH WILL CONTRIBUTE A LOT OF BITTERNESS BUT HAS A VERY VERY UNIQUE STRONG PINE ALMOST CANDY-LIKE AROMA WHICH WILL PROVIDE A GREAT BACKGROUND FOR OUR BEER
IN FACT SLENDER FILEFISH CAN DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THEIR COLORS TO BETTER BLEND IN WITH THEIR BACKGROUND
SO LOOK HERE WE'VE GOT AN AMAZING COBALT BLUE SKY BRIGHT RED BALCONY YELLOW WALL AND A BLUE JACUZZI WITH THE GREEN IN THE BACKGROUND
YOU MIGHT HAVE A BETTER ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE A PARENT YOU MIGHT HAVE A BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR MEDICAL BACKGROUND ANY KIND OF MAJOR EVENTS
LIGHT IT SO EVERYTHING IS VISIBLE AND THEN COME BACK IN AND USE OTHER LIGHTS TO USE TO CREATE HIGHLIGHTS DRAMA DIFFUSION SO THAT YOU NOT SEEING DISTRACTING REFLECTIONS OR REFRACTIONS ON THE SURFACE OF THE INSTRUMENTS AND THEN COME UP WITH A LIGHTING SYSTEM THAT WORKS TO HELP SEPARATE IT FROM THE BACKGROUND AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET SOME PRETTY INTERESTING PRODUCT SHOTS
MOST PERSONAL TRAINERS HAVE A BACKGROUND IN KINESIOLOGY OR EXERCISE SCIENCE
WHEN YOU CREATE YOUR CHARACTER YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DRAW IN YOUR OWN INTEREST YOUR OWN EXPERTISE TO HELP STRENGTHEN YOUR CHARACTERS' BACKGROUND
THE STARTING POINT'S GOING TO BE THE FOREGROUND COLOR OR THE BACKGROUND COLOR NOT THE FOREGROUND COLOR AND THE ENDING POINT'S GOING TO BE THE BACKGROUND COLOR
IT WILL TRY TO GIVE YOU THE LARGEST APERTURE SETTING IN ORDER TO MAKE THE BACKGROUND BLUR OUT A LOT AND IT WILL HELP TO MAKE YOUR SUBJECT OR YOUR PORTRAIT INDIVIDUAL STAND OUT FROM THE BACKGROUND
WHEN YOU'RE TAKING PORTRAITS IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA TO MAKE THE BACKGROUND AS FAR AWAY FROM THE SUBJECT AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM STICK OUT FROM THE BACKGROUND
AND IF YOU HAVE A TELEPHOTO LENS THAT WILL ALSO HELP TO BLUR THE BACKGROUND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE A HEART IN THE MIDDLE OR A SUN YOU WANT TO START WITH THAT SHAPE AND TILE THAT WHOLE SHAPE AND THEN TILE THE BACKGROUND
BUT YOU CAN POINT IT IN TOO AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT ILLUMINATES THE BACKGROUND A LITTLE BIT MORE
HOW TO GET A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SHOTS EITHER THROUGH VARYING YOUR PERSPECTIVE FROM LOW TO HIGH VARYING WHAT IS IN THE BACKGROUND AND SO FORTH
LIKE I SAID THIS ONE IS IDEAL FOR ME BECAUSE IT'S IN A QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD I'VE GOT THE SHADE OF THIS UMBRELLA IF I NEED IT AND I CAN POP THAT OVER AND I'M KIND OF RIGHT HERE WITH A NICE BACKGROUND
AND AGAIN I'M STILL CUT FROM THE BACKGROUND GOT A NICE CROWNING ON THE SHOULDERS AND THE HEAD BUT I'M STILL IN SHADOW
AND I WANT TO ADD A GRADIENT BACKGROUND SO I'VE CHOSEN A COUPLE OF BLUE COLORS HERE BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE MY GRADIENT'S GOING TO PULL FROM
IF WE LOOK AT OUR SCREEN HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT I HAVE THIS SUNFLOWER THAT I HAVE ROUGHLY CUT OUT OF ITS BACKGROUND
WELL LET'S DO A FULL GRADIENT BACKGROUND COLOR SO I'LL GRAB THAT ONE
NOW WE CAN KNOCK OUT THE GREEN BACKGROUND IN PHOTOSHOP OR ANOTHER PROGRAM BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH THIS WHITE SPACE IS WE'D HAVE TO PAINT AROUND THE IMAGE SO THAT WE'D HAVE THIS BLEND INTO A SKIN TONE
ONE OF THE MAJOR THINGS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ROOM THAT YOU'RE SLEEPING IN DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF NOISE OR BACKGROUND ENVIRONMENT AND THAT IT'S DARK ENOUGH
THE NICE THING ABOUT THE SOFT BOX IS YOU CAN ILLUMINATE THE BACKGROUND ALSO AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT A BIG STRONG SHADOW
