IF YOU ADD A SPIN TO THAT IT'S A LITTLE IT'S EASIER TO ACTUALLY GENERATE A LITTLE BIT MORE POWER IF YOU SPIN PUT A SPIN INTO THE CRESCENTS
BUT YOU WANT TO START LOOKING TO YOUR INSIDE SHOULDER WHICH EVER WAY YOU NATURALLY WAY YOU WANT TO SPIN AND AS YOU COME IN YOU POP AND YOU PUSH THE BIKE THROUGH BUT YOU MAKE SURE TO KEEP LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER CAUSE YOU BODY BASICALLY WILL FOLLOW WHEREVER YOU LOOKS SO AS LONG AS YOU KEEP LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LAND JUST FINE
IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SPIN A COMPLETE 180 BECAUSE ONCE YOU START LEARNING THEM YOU WOULD CARRY MUCH BETTER SPEED RIDING OUT BACKWARDS IF YOU SPIN IT REALLY A COMPLETE 180 RATHER THEN SPINNING YOU KNOW A 160 DEGREES OR SO WHERE YOU ARE BASICALLY GOING TO LAND IN A COMPLETE STOP
IN THE NEXT SEGMENT I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE A LITTLE MORE TOP SPIN
NOW THAT WE KNOW HOW TO SPIN OUR POI FORWARD AND BACKWARD LET'S TRY A FUN LITTLE TRICK THAT LETS YOU SWITCH FROM GOING FORWARDS TO BACKWARDS
AS YOU'RE LEARNING HOW TO SPIN POI IT MIGHT NOT BE OBVIOUS AT FIRST BUT THE AWARENESS OF THE UPSWING AND THE DOWNSWING OF THE POI ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN MANIPULATING THEM TO MOVE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
I'M GOING TO KINDA GO AT AN ANGLE AND JUMP FROM HERE JUMP THROW MY ARM TWIST IN TIGHTEN AND SPIN OUT ONE TWO BAM AND YOU WANT TO GET ALL THE WAY TO A SOLID LANDING
IF YOU WANTED TO CUT THE BALL TO THE LEFT IN A CUTTER FASTBALL YOU'D POSITION YOUR FINGERS ON THE LEFT HALF OF THE BALL TO CREATE SPIN AND MOVEMENT THAT WOULD MAKE THE BALL BASICALLY CURVE TO THE RIGHT
YOU DON'T NEED TO LEARN THEM ALL AND YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE YOUR OWN SPIN ON EACH INDIVIDUAL TRICK
SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NOW THAT WE'RE GETTING INTO LONGER IRONS AND THEY'RE NOT QUITE AS LOFTED YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GENERATE MORE SIDE SPIN ON IT
SO YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE NORMAL UNDER SPIN OF STRIKING A BALL BUT WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE THE FACE LIKE THIS TO CREATE SOME SIDE SPIN SO THE BALL WILL SPIN AND GO TO THE LEFT
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE FULL SPIN WITH OUR RIGHT STICK LIKE THIS BUT AT THE END OF IT WE'RE GOING TO KICK OUR LEG OVER THE TOP AND THROW UP IN THE MIDDLE
THERE'S MANY MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO SPIN A BO STAFF AROUND SO YOU CAN'T REALLY HOLD YOURSELF TO ONE
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO SPIN AROUND A BO STAFF
YOU CAN ADD IT IN TO YOUR FORMS OR INTO YOUR COTTAS OR ANYTHING THAT YOU MAKE UP IS JUST TO TAKE THE BO STAFF SPIN IT AROUND AND TAKE ONE HAND OFF CATCH IT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND JUST CONTINUE TO FLIP LEFT OR RIGHT HAND WHICHEVER YOU START OUT WITH
BOOM SPIN A REAR LEG ROUND KICK
EACH THROW HAS TO GO ACROSS SINGLE SPIN AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S IN TIME SO THAT IT'S THROW THROW CATCH CATCH
BECAUSE IF THERE WAS A GLOBE DOWN HERE ON THE GROUND AND I WANTED TO SPIN THAT GLOBE IF I TOOK THAT CLUB HEAD AND I'M JUST WATCHING THE CLUB HEAD IF I BROUGHT THAT CLUB HEAD INSIDE AND SWUNG THAT CLUB HEAD OUT AND BEFORE I GOT TO THAT GLOBE I RELEASED OR TURNED IT OVER OR FLIPPED IT OVER
THAT IS GOING TO SPIN THAT GLOBE
IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO SPIN IT JUST A LITTLE BIT TO HELP WORK THAT GREASE AROUND WHERE IT SHOULD BE
AS YOU NOLLIE TURN YOUR UPPER BODY TOWARDS THE FRONT FOOT SO THE REST OF THE BOARD WILL SPIN THE 180 DEGREES
SO YOU PUT YOUR FOOT ON THE FLOOR WE ARE GOING TO SPIN AROUND THE RIGHT FOOT AND SO THE IDEA IS TO PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR FOOT AND THEN MOVE YOUR WEIGHT MOVE YOUR BODY WEIGHT YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY OVER THAT FOOT AND PUSH OFF WITH THE BACK FOOT
NOW WITH THIS TECHNIQUE YOU USE THE LEAD HAND TO BLOCK YOU ARE GOING TO BLOCK WITH THE LEFT HAND LIKE THIS SPIN THE WAIST OVER TO THE LEFT DROP THE RIGHT LEG DOWN AND FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE HOOK KICK
I AM GOING TO SPIN PUSH AND FLUSH
THAT'S UNDER THE LEG WITH A TASSEL SPIN
NOW WHAT I'M ACTUALLY DOING IS I'M SPINNING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE STICK GETTING AN OUTSIDE SPIN ON THE TASSEL KICKING MY LEG OVER AND LETTING THE STICK JUST ROLL OVER MY LEG LIKE THAT AND BACK OUT TO MY RIGHT CONTROL STICK JUST LIKE THAT
THE TASSEL SPIN TECHNIQUE IS VERY DIFFERENT
WE'D ALREADY TALKED ABOUT DOING THIS WITH JUST THE NORMAL TICKTOCK AND NORMAL SPIN
RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT DOING SPIN TRICKS WITH THE TASSEL SPIN
SO I'M GOING TO JUST GENTLY SQUEEZE OVER AND OVER AS I SPIN THIS BANDING WHEEL
YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO KEEP A STRAIGHT LINE FROM THE CROWN OF YOUR HEAD THROUGH YOUR SITZ BONES SO COME INTO TABLE TOP AND COW HAPPENS WHEN YOU SPIN THE SITZ BONES UP TOWARD THE CEILING DROP THE BELLY AND GENTLY RAISE THE HEART
SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SPIN MY HOOK AROUND SO THAT MY THREAD IS HANGING DOWN NOT MAKING CONTACT WITH THAT SHARP POINT AND I'M READY TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STEP
THE LOWER THE LOFT THE MORE SIDE SPIN YOU GET
WHEN THE FRISBEE COMES IN YOU DON'T WANT TO CLOSE YOUR HAND TOO EARLY AND YOU DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOUR HAND OPEN TOO LONG BECAUSE THE FRISBEE CAN THEN COME IN HIT YOUR HAND AND SPIN OUT
WHAT I DO IS I TAKE IT I SPIN IT AROUND TO WHERE MY ARMS ARE CROSSED BUT THEN I LAY IT UP AGAINST MY BODY TO THE SIDE AND THAT'S ACTUALLY A STRIKE IN OF ITSELF BUT THEN YOU CAN TURN THAT INTO A SPIN BY TAKING IT UNCROSSING YOUR ARMS CHANGING YOUR HANDS POSITIONS SO NOW YOUR RIGHT HAND IS PALM DOWN LEFT HAND PALM UP
SPIN IT TO CROSS YOUR ARMS AND LAY IT DOWN SO IF YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER YOU JUST GO BACK AND FORTH JUST LIKE THAT
YOU JUST HAVE TO LEARN TO CHANGE YOUR HANDS AT THE RIGHT TIME AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE STAYING IN THE CENTER OF THE BO STAFF SO THOSE ARE JUST TWO OR THREE BASIC WAYS TO BE ABLE TO SPIN YOUR BO STAFF AROUND AND GET STARTED
GET A LITTLE BIT OF SPEED AND STOMP ON THE NOSE AND AS YOU STOMP SPIN YOUR BODY IN THE DIRECTION THAT YOU WANT TO TURN AND ON THIS THE NOLLIE FRONTSIDE 180 IS THE SPIN WHERE YOU CAN SEE WHERE YOU ARE TURNING THUS MAKING IT THE EASIER OF THE TWO BUT WHEN YOU INCORPORATE THE PUSHING AND RIDING AROUND AND ALL THE OTHER PARTS OF THE NOLLIE 180 AND YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A JUMP 720 SPIN
SO WHEN YOU DO YOUR JUMP SPIN 720 YOU'RE GOING TO JUMP AND PULL YOUR GUARDS IN SO YOU'RE DOING A NICE TIGHT SPIN AND THEN AT THE LAST SECOND YOU'RE GOING TO THROW OUT YOUR LEG TO DO YOUR KICK OKAY
SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO I'M GOING TO GO REALLY LOW START OPENING MY SHOULDERS AND ONCE I GET BACK HERE I'M GOING TO RELEASEAND IT S JUST GOING TO PHYSICALLY SPIN ME TO WHERE I'M FACING THAT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREE TURN
LIKE I SAID ONCE YOU GET THESE 180S YOU CAN PROGRESS ON THE 360S WHICH IS TWO FULL SPINS FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY 540 WHICH IS ONE AND A HALF FULL SPINS SO ON AND SO FORTH AND THEN BASICALLY THIS 180 IS A STEPPING BLOCK TO EVERY OTHER SPIN
PICK UP OUR KNEE AND SPIN ALL THE WAY AROUND ALL THE WAY BACK TO STARTING POSITION
AND HE CREATES HIS WINDOW PUMPS THE ARMS AND THE SPIN
NOW I'VE DONE SOME OTHER ONES WHERE YOU CAN SPIN AROUND AND CATCH THE BALL AND THESE ARE FOR DOWN DEEP PATTERNS WHERE YOU'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING BACK OVER YOUR SHOULDER AND IT'S THE TRUEST WAY TO DISORIENT YOURSELF AND LOCATE THE BALL AT THE SAME TIME
WE'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO SPIN THEM FORWARDS AND BACKWARDS
SO TO DO THE SET FOR THE FOR THE NAIL DELAY YOU WANT TO PUT SOME SPIN ON IT AND KEEP THAT NAIL RIGHT IN THE CENTER FOLLOWING THE CENTER AT ALL TIMES
SO WHAT ALSO WITH A NAIL DELAY YOU NEED TO PUT A LOT OF SPIN ON YOUR FRISBEE
SO I'M GOING TO TRY MY SAND WEDGE SO HERE I'M NOT TRYING TO SPIN IT OR PUT ON THE GREEN I'M JUST TRYING TO ADVANCE THE BALL TOWARD THE GREEN OR TO GET IT TO THE GREEN WITH A FULL CLUB
THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO GET THE HEIGHT YOU WANT AND THE SPIN YOU WANT
PUT LIGHT SHAFT IN YOUR HAND AND YOU WILL CREATE THAT FASTER SPIN SPEED
THIS IS JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO CREATE A FASTER SPIN SPEED
CALEB LABARDA NOW IN THIS PART WE'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO DO OUR SPIN OKAY
YOU GOTTA BE ABLE TO LEARN KNOW HOW TO SPIN AND GET A LOT OF SPEED AND MOMENTUM BUILT UP AND THEN KNOW HOW TO LAND ON YOUR FEET AT THE SAME TIME
OUR SPIN IS VERY IMPORTANT
WHEN YOU SPIN IN A CIRCLE IF YOU NOTICE YOU JUST SPIN LIKE THIS
OKAY SO NOW WHEN YOU WANT TO SPIN WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO USE SOME SCIENCE HERE
WE DON'T WANT IT TO HAVE ANY EXCESS FORWARD ROLL WE DON'T WANT IT TO HAVE ANY EXCESS BACKSPIN OR SIDE SPIN OR ANYTHING ELSE
IF YOU DON'T PUT A LOT OF SPIN ON YOUR FRISBEE IT'S GOING TO BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO DO A NAIL DELAY AND YOU WANT YOUR FRISBEE TO COME DOWN NICE AND FLAT
THEY'RE USUALLY MADE OF PLASTIC AND ALTHOUGH YOU CAN GET SOME OLD ONES THAT ARE MADE OUT OF WOOD THEY ARE MADE TO SPIN IN THE AIR
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PHYSICALLY SPIN IT WHEN YOU THROW IT IT PRETTY MUCH AUTOMATICALLY DOES IT
NOW WHEN YOU'RE FIRST STARTING TO CATCH A FRISBEE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO KIND OF PAY ATTENTION TO THE SPIN
AND YOU WANT TO KEEP THE LITTLE BIT OF A FOLD THERE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT SPIN IN THE END
TO SET THE CAMERA TO PORTRAIT MODE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS TAKE THIS MODE DIAL HERE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BACK SIDE OF THE CAMERA AND I'M JUST GOING TO SPIN IT FROM FULLY AUTOMATIC MODE TO PORTRAIT MODE
ALRIGHT THAT WAS REALLY GOOD OKAY NICE AND HIGH OFF THE BOARD YOU DID SEE A REALLY NICE TIGHT SPIN OKAY YOU SAW OR PROBABLY DID NOT SEE HIM BUT IN THE AIR BUT HE WAS LOOKING FOR THE WATER TO SPOT HE KICKED OUT NICE AND STRONG GOT GOOD EXTENSION AND COULD HAVE STRETCHED HIS ARMS A LITTLE MORE BUT THAT WAS REALLY GOOD REVERSE ONE AND A HALF TUCK
YOU CAN AVOID THAT BY LISTENING TO YOUR GUIDE AND PADDLING IF YOU HIT THE ROCK ANYWAY THE GUIDE SHOUTS OUT â€œHIGH SIDE' IF YOU CLIMB TOWARD THE HIGH SIDE OF THE ROCK THE HIGH SIDE OF THE RAFT THEN THE WEIGHT WILL COME OFF THE LOW SIDE AND YOU CAN SPIN OFF THAT ROCK CELEBRATE A CLOSE CALL AND CONTINUE ON DOWNSTREAM
AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE IT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU THAT MOBILITY OF YOUR FOOT TO PICK IT UP AND SPIN USING YOUR HIPS AND TO GENERATE MORE POWER
THIS IS JUST UNDER SPIN NOTHING TOO FANCY
EASY DAYS TECHNIQUE DAYS WHERE WE EMPHASIZE SPIN AND YOU SHOULD RIDE BETWEEN EIGHTY AND 100 RPM'S
SO IF YOU WATCH IT AGAIN I'M DOING A FULL SPIN WITH MY RIGHT CONTROL STICK KICKING MY RIGHT LEG OVER IT AT THE SAME TIME THEN I'M TOSSING IT UP THE MIDDLE AND CATCHING AGAIN
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR SINGLE SPIN LIKE THIS DOWN PRETTY CLEAN AND JUST PRACTICE IT GET USED TO IT DO IT FROM BOTH SIDES AND THEN YOU CAN START ADDING IT TO YOUR REPERTOIRE OF TRICKS
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE IS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ONE CLUB DO A DOUBLE SPIN AND ONE CLUB DO A SINGLE SPIN SOMETHING LIKE ALMOST LIKE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT
THE ORANGE CLUB WHICH IS STACKED LIKE THIS THAT IS THE ONE THAT WILL SPIN TWICE
THIS IS GOING TO BE YOUR BASIS FOR YOUR SPIN LATER ON AND THIS IS A REALLY CRUCIAL PART
AND BASICALLY THE REASON BEHIND THAT IS YOU ARE PUTTING SPIN ON THE GOLF BALL
SO I'M GOING TO SPIN IT CLOCKWISE SPIN I'M GOING TO DO A UNDER THE LEG PULL OUT TO THE ANGLE SET TRY THAT ONE AGAIN
CLOCKWISE SPIN TO THE ANGLE SET TO THE CHAIR CATCH
JUST SPIN IT AROUND AND THAT WILL TAKE I'LL TAKE THE OUTSIDE PLASTIC PIECE OFF AND THEN WITH A PAIR OF PLIERS THE CENTER PIECE WILL COME OUT
NOW AGAIN YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE FIRST STARTING TO CATCH FRISBEES BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IT'S SPINNING IF IT HAS A LOT OF SPIN AND IT HITS YOUR PALM IT'S GOING TO SPIN RIGHT OUT
IF I GO ANY FURTHER BACK I AM ACTUALLY COUNTER ACTING THAT SPIN AND THAT'S BAD
THIS IS A STROKE THAT THE PRO'S WILL USE WHEN YOU SEE THEM DOING CLEAN SPIN ON THE WAVES OR CLEAN SPINS IN THE HOLE
AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY BALANCE IT THERE WITHOUT IT SPINNING BUT IF YOU COULD PUT SOME SPIN ON IT AND HAVE THAT CLAW DELAY AND THEN YOU CAN GO TO TWO FINGERS AND THEN ONE FINGER AND YOU'LL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GET CONTROL WHICH WILL OPEN UP THE DOOR TO MANY MANY MANY MORE TRICKS
NOW YOU MIGHT NEED TO HOLD ON TO THE GLASS PORTION OF THE OTHER SIDE OF IT SO THAT IT DOESN'T SPIN
SO SIT HERE PRACTICING RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT MAKE SURE YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR POSTURE THINK ABOUT YOUR THROWS THINK ABOUT THE SPIN A LOT OF THINGS TO KEEP TRACK OF I KNOW BUT PRACTICE ENOUGH AND YOU'LL GET IT CLEAN
NOW IF YOU'RE GETTING TOO MUCH SPIN AND IT'S COMING BACK TO YOU ODDS ARE YOU'RE HOLDING IT TOO FAR UP ON THE CLUB
NOW THE MOST COMMON THING IS ONE OF TWO THINGS EITHER ONCE AGAIN LIKE THE BALLS YOU'RE THROWING THEM TOO FAR OUT AND YOU HAVE TO RUN AFTER THEM OR WHAT'S EVEN MORE COMMON IS YOU'RE GETTING TOO MUCH OF A SPIN ON IT AND IT'S COMING BACK AND IT'S WHACKING YOU ON THE LIP
SO I JUST PUSH IT AND SPIN IT UNTIL IT GIVES
