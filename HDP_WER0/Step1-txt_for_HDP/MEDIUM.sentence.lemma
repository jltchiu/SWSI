OKAY THE CARAMEL IS LOOKING GOOD IT'S NOT TO RUNNY IT'S ABOUT A MEDIUM CONSISTENCY HERE LIKE A MEDIUM SAUCE YOU DON'T WANT IT ANY THINNER IF IT'S THICKER IT WILL LUMP UP IN THE CHEESECAKE BETTER
ON OUR CLIENT TODAY I SEE A LITTLE BIT OF DRYNESS SO TODAY I'M GOING TO CHOOSE SKIN SMOOTHING CREAM A NICE MEDIUM WEIGHT MOISTURIZER
SO MY HOT TOOLS NOT ONLY IS IT GOOD BECAUSE IT'S CERAMIC BUT I CAN ALSO CONTROL ITS TEMPERATURE SO WHEN I HAVE DIFFERENT CLIENT'S WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF HAIR WHETHER IT'S FINE MEDIUM OR THICK I USE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE
YOU JUST KEEP BUILDING UP THE SURFACE WITH INK AND PEOPLE SOME PEOPLE FIND THIS TO BE A VERY VERY EXPRESSIVE TYPE OF MEDIUM
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SET IT TO ABOUT MEDIUM DEPENDING ON THE STOVE THAT YOU HAVE
YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME WITH ABOUT A MEDIUM WEIGHT JUST ONLY REALLY A FEW OUNCES
I WOULD TRY AND STICK WITH A MEDIUM GOLDEN SHADE BECAUSE IF YOU DO TOO ASH IT MAY COME UP GREEN IF YOU DO TOO WARM IT MAY COME UP A LITTLE BRASSIE
SO THAT EXPLAINS TO YOU GUYS HOW TO USE OIL PASTELS IT'S A GREAT DRAWING MEDIUM IF YOU REALLY ENJOY TO DRAW AND NOT PAINTING THAT MUCH AND USING THIS IS A GREAT MEDIUM FOR PEOPLE THAT REALLY ENJOY TO DRAW
NOW THIS IS A MEDIUM TO HARD CLUB TRICK
IT COMES IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT SIZES OF A CERTAIN SORT OF MEDIUM RANGE WIDTH
THE MEDIUM YOU PUT IN THE PAINT TO KEEP IT IN THE FABRIC DRIES PRETTY QUICK
SO CHALK IS A WONDERFUL MEDIUM YOU MIGHT THINK IT'S VERY CHALKY BUT ONCE WE GET IN ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND IT BETTER YOU CAN ACTUALLY JUST TAKE YOUR FIXATIVE NOW IT'S A WORKABLE FIXATIVE AND CLEAR IT
SOMETIMES YOU CAN MIX IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF MEDIUM TO THIN IT OUT A LITTLE BIT IF YOUR WHITE IS TOO THICK
SO IF I ALREADY HAVE THAT LIQUID ON THERE I COULD TAKE MY PASTELS AGAIN TAKE A DIFFERENT COLOR FOR EXAMPLE TAKE A DARKER BLUE NOW IT'S REALLY SOFT CAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF MEDIUM ON THERE AS YOU CAN TELL IT'S APPLYING ON THERE A LOT BETTER THAN IT DID THE FIRST TIME CAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING ON THE SURFACE
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT TEXTURE IN SOMETHING AND YOU JUST WANT TO USE AS A LAY DOWN MEDIUM YOU COULD ALSO USE THAT AND MIX IT WITH CAUSE IT IS OIL YOU NEED TO USE YOUR MINERAL SPIRITS YOUR PAINT THINNER AND YOU CAN APPLY THAT RIGHT ON TOP OF WHAT YOU JUST DREW AND IT'LL BLEND IT IN AND STILL LEAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A TEXTURE IF THAT'S THE EFFECT THAT YOU WANT JUST BY SMUDGING IT IN HERE
ONCE YOU YOU GOT ENOUGH SPEED COMING DOWN THE QUARTERS SLOW TO MEDIUM PACE YOU WANT TO HEAD UP THE RAMP
AND THEN IN THE MIDDLE THEY HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH CALLED F H AND B AND THOSE ARE ALL SORT OF MEDIUM WEIGHTS
YOU ARE NOT SQUINTING YOUR EYES ALL DAY LIKE ME BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE MY GOGGLES RIGHT NOW AND YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO GET A MEDIUM LENS WHICH IS PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE AMBER OR ROSE AND THAT IS LIKE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE THERE FOR THOSE SUNNY DAYS WHERE YOU JUST WANT THE SUN TO STAY OUT OF YOUR EYES A LITTLE BIT AND NEXT I HAVE GOT SOME WAX HERE
OKAY SO NOW ALL THOSE BULBS ARE COVERED UP SO NOW I WANT TO GO WITH MY MEDIUM SIZE BULBS INTO THE POT
THIS IS A MEDIUM FORMAT NEGATIVE IN THIS NEGATIVE CARRIER HERE
YOU CAN GO TO AN EVEN MORE EXTREME DIFFERENCE BY THROWING ONE VERY HIGH A MEDIUM HEIGHT AND THEN A LOW HEIGHT WITH A VERY SMALL EXCHANGE AT THE BOTTOM
SO I'LL WORK AT THE MEDIUM BRUSH FOR A WHILE KIND OF FINISH OUT THESE AREAS HERE MAYBE MAKE TRACE IT ONE TIME
ANY OF THESE CURRIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE HERE OUT OF YOUR ORIENTAL MARKETS OR YOUR GENERAL GROCERY STORES TEND TO BE THE MEDIUM TO THE MILDER CURRIES
SO I'VE GOT MY BRUSH SO NOW I'M GOING TO SWITCH TO MY MEDIUM BRUSH AND JUST SAME THING
A PAIR OF 440'S OR SOMETHING MEDIUM SIZE IS PRETTY NICE
I HAVE TWO MEDIUM ONIONS AND SIX TO EIGHT CELERY STALKS CUT OF COURSE
WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR OIL TO ABOUT 350 DEGREES SO WE ARE GOING TO PUT THAT ON MEDIUM HIGH AND WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR SAUCE UP TO BOIL HERE
WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT ON MEDIUM LOW BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THE SUGARS IN THE TOMATO SAUCE GET CARAMELIZED AND GIVE IT THAT KIND OF BURNT FLAVOR
YOU WANT TO USE A MEDIUM SPEED ON THE DRILL SO THAT YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER IT AND IT'S NOT GOING TOO FAST
MAKE SURE THAT YOUR SKIN IS COMPLETELY BLENDED AND COVERED IN A LIGHT TO MEDIUM FOUNDATION
SO AS YOU CAN SEE AS I'M APPLYING THE PASTEL IT'S A VERY CHALKY KIND OF MEDIUM AND IF YOU CAN CLOSE IN ON THIS WHILE I'M DOING IT YOU CAN SEE THE CHALK JUST COMING RIGHT OFF
SO MAYBE THE FIRST TWO SHADES LIGHTER TOO LIKE A MEDIUM LIGHT
JUST GO CROSS WAYS AND AS YOU SEE WE ARE GETTING A NICE SORT OF MEDIUM DICE OUT OF IT
SO YOU WANT TO CREAM THIS ON MEDIUM SPEED FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES
AND WE ARE GOING TO TURN THIS UP TO ABOUT MEDIUM AND YOU KNOW MEDIUM MEDIUM LOW
I RAISED MY FLAME JUST A LITTLE BIT TO ABOUT A MEDIUM SIZE FLAME AND I'M CONSTANTLY STIRRING THIS AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NOW IS SEE ON THE BOTTOM
HERE WE HAVE A SOFT YARN THAT IS ALSO A WORSTED MEDIUM BUT BECAUSE IT IS SOFTER IT BENDS A BIT DIFFERENTLY SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHENEVER YOU START A PATTERN THAT YOU BUY ENOUGH YARN TO COMPLETE YOUR ENTIRE PROJECT BECAUSE THESE COME IN DIFFERENT WEIGHTS AND DIFFERENT SOFTNESS
THIS ONE IS WORSTED MEDIUM
NOW THIS IS A MEDIUM TO EASY BALL JUGGLING PATTERN WHEN YOU DO IT WITH THREE
BUT TWELVE FOR THIS MEDIUM WEIGHT YARN IS A GOOD NUMBER FOR OUR BASE CIRCLE SO IT CAN CONTINUE
I WOULD USE A CHEAP BRUSH NOTHING NOT A VERY GOOD BRUSH AND YOU CAN START PUSHING THIS AROUND SORT OF LIKE AN INK WASH OR A OR A ANY OTHER FLUID MEDIUM
AND WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR THE HUGEST LEAVES WE'RE LOOKING FOR NICE SMALL LEAVES MEDIUM SIZED ONES THAT HAVE THE YOUNG DNA IN IT SO THAT WHEN WE EAT THEM IT MAKES YOUNG CELLS IN US
IF YOU ARE PRINTING MEDIUM FORMATS SAY A SIX X SIX NEGATIVE YOU'RE GOING TO WANT A 8MM LENS
