SAME THING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS TAKE OUR HAND STRAIGHT DOWN AT OUR SIDE RIGHT OUTSIDE OF OUR HIP
ONCE AGAIN THE WATER GOING BACK INTO THE OCEAN IS GOING TO CREATE A LITTLE RIVER THAT IS FLOWING ALONG THE SIDE OF THE WAVE WHICH IS THE SIDE OF THE SANDBAR
OKAY IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE COVERING REMOVING THE DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT AND REAR INNER DOOR INSERTS
IF YOU'LL LOOK AT THE INSERT ON BOTH ENDS YOU'LL SEE HOW IT OVERLAPS THE TWO PLASTIC PARTS ON EITHER SIDE
RIGHT THERE YOU CAN GET A REALLY GOOD LOOK AT THIS ONE ON THIS SIDE
I WILL SHOW YOU ON THIS SIDE
THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FROM THE SIDE SO YOU CAN SEE IT COMING OUT BUT FROM THE FRONT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE ACTUALLY BENDING THE SPOON
SO JUST CUT UP THE SIDE AND THEN CUT TOOK MY RAZOR BLADE CAUSE IT WON'T FIT ALL THE WAY ACROSS
SO HER RIGHT KNEE IS UP CRANE HER RIGHT ARM IS IN ROLLING BLOCK AND LEFT HAND IS OUT TO THE SIDE
WE'LL TRY THE OTHER SIDE JUST SO THAT WE'RE SURE THAT WE WERE CLEAR IN OUR DEMONSTRATION
WHEN YOU TAKE THEM OUT OF THE DRYER THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE INSIDE OUT BECAUSE YOU WASH THEM INSIDE OUT TO RETAIN THE COLOR SO YOU'LL TURN THOSE RIGHT SIDE IN OR RIGHT SIDE OUT
FOLD THE ONE SIDE IN
IMPORTANT THINGS ON SIDE LUNGES IS THE FEET STAY STRAIGHT AHEAD
THE MAJOR ONES BEING FRONT REAR AND SIDE
THIS EXERCISE THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER NOW IS CALLED SIDE LUNGES
WHETHER IT'S THE TRIM ON THE SIDE OF THE CAR OR EVEN THE LETTERS YOU KNOW YOU CAN REALLY MAKE CHROME LOOK GREAT
THIS EXERCISE IS CALLED THE SIDE PLANK AND THIS IS A GREAT EXERCISE THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED FROM YOGA SO WE ARE GOING TO INCORPORATE THE CORE AND WE ARE GOING TO WORK ON BALANCE STABILITY STRENGTH ALL THAT GREAT STUFF TO MAKE US NICE AND TALL IN OUR POSTURE AND YOU WANT TO COME TO THE STAIRS AND JUST PLACE YOUR HAND ON ONE OF THE STEPS AND KIND OF WALK YOUR FEET OUT AND YOU WANT TO LIFT THROUGH YOUR TORSO HERE EXTEND YOUR TOP ARM UP TOWARDS THE CEILING AND JUST HOLD THIS POSITION AND YOU CAN HOLD THIS POSITION FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS TO A MINUTE
IF YOU NEED TO MODIFY JUST LOWER DOWN ONE KNEE AND SIDE PLANK HERE
YOU CAN PERFORM THIS POSE FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS TO A MINUTE AND THEN SIMPLY SWITCH SIDES AND THAT IS YOUR SIDE PLANK AND WORK THAT CORE
WE'RE GOING TO LAY THE LEADING EDGE OF THE GLIDER IN A NICE ARC FROM ONE SIDE AND THE SAME THING ON THE OTHER SIDE
WE ARE NOW READY TO MOVE ON TO TRACK SIDE AND MAINTENANCE TO WAIST STRUCTURES
MY NAME IS KEVIN BLAKENEY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND IT IS NOW TIME TO ADD MAINTENANCES WASTE STRUCTURES TO YOUR TRACK SIDE ON YOUR NEW MODEL RAILROAD VILLAGE
NOW TRACK SIDE STRUCTURES ALSO INCLUDE ANY LIGHTING OR SIGNALS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PLACED ALONG SIDE OF THE TRACK
YOU'RE KNEELING HANDS GET PLACED ON THE BALL KIND OF LIKE A KARATE CHOP AND WHEN I PUSH THE BALL OUT BENDING AT THE HIPS AND THEN USING THE ELBOWS TO DRIVE THE BALL IN TO THE SIDE AND BACK UP
ALICE MONSAERT THIS EXERCISE IS GOING TO TARGET THE LATISSIMUS DORSI WHICH IS THE LARGE MUSCLE ALONG THE SIDE OF THE BACK
SO THE ABDOMINALS ARE IN TIGHT AND I PULL THE ELBOWS TOWARDS THE SIDE
A VEE CUT IS JUST SIMPLY YOU WILL BE CUTTING A SLOT ON EACH SIDE OF A LINE
THESE ARE USED FOR EITHER DECORATIVE PURPOSES OR AS A MEANS OF STARTING AND MARKING EACH SIDE OF A BEAD
AGAIN YOU START UP FROM ON HIGH LOWER THE TOOL DOWN AND THIS WILL GIVE YOU A SLIGHT MARK AND THEN GO IN AND WIDEN THE CUT TO EACH SIDE
BRING IT DOWN UNTIL YOU MAKE A MARK THEN GO TO EACH SIDE OF THAT MARK AND WIDEN THE CUT
I JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT I DON'T PUT THEM ON THE SHADOW SIDE
FOLD THIS SIDE IN TOO
SOMETHING I'M GOING TO GO TO THE RIGHT SIDE
SO THAT ONE I'M GOING TO CONCENTRATE MORE TO MY LEGS TO STRETCHING MY SPINE MY STOMACH EVERYTHING GOES UP AND RELEASE AND GOES UP AND RELEASE AND I'M GOING TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE
NOW JUST LIKE YOU WERE WHEN YOU WERE PUTTING YOUR HANDS IN THE HOOP YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK FOR THAT OPENING TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HOOP
AND THEN RELEASE TO THE FLOOR AND TURN THE HEAD TO ONE SIDE AGAIN RESTING
THIS IS GREAT TO STRENGTHEN THE WHOLE ERECTOR-SPINY MUSCLES THAT ARE DOWN THE SIDE OF THE SPINE
SO WHEN YOU GET THIS SIDE IN NOW SEE YOU HAVE ABOUT A TWO INCH OVERHANG THERE
AND THEN PIN THAT SIDE IN
AND WE'LL DO THE SAME THING ON THE OTHER SIDE
LITTLE FLAKE WILL COME OFF THE BACK SIDE
SO THREE AND A FOUR YOU HAVE AND A FIVE AND A SIX YOU'RE GOING TO DO TWO FLAPS SIDE BY SIDE AND A SEVEN
SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS USE THE PORTALS QUICKLY IN SUCCESSION TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE
NOW IT SHOULD TURN FROM GREEN ALONG THE SIDE OF THE WAND SHOULD GO FROM GREEN TO RED IF IT'S REAL AND IT SHOULD BEEP
NOW OFF TO THE SIDE HERE YOU WANT TO DRAW TWO NICKEL-SIZE CIRCLES AS WELL
NOT SIDE TIED
OKAY SO WE LEARNED FOUR BASIC KICKS FRONT KICK SIDE KICK BACK KICK AND ROUNDHOUSE KICK
SO SOME VARIATIONS ARE YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOU ADD A CRESCENT KICK WHERE THE KICK COMES UP AND IT COMES OUT SLAPPING ON THE SIDE THE SIDE OF THE HEAD
AND YOU JUST GO AHEAD AND LEAN TO ONE SIDE
AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE PEELING YOUR SHRIMP YOU WANT TO TURN THEM OVER AND LOOK AT THIS BACK SIDE
SOME PEOPLE WILL START WITH ONE SIDE AND THEN MOVE OVER AND TAKE THE OTHER SIDE
AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO A SIDEKICK TO THE SIDE
TWO IN ONE HAND SIDE BY SIDE TWO IN THE OTHER HAND
THEN I'M GOING TO GO SLOW NOW TO SHOW YOU LEVERAGE HIM OVER COME A LITTLE BIT NEON SIDE POSITION YOU COULD FINISH WITH PUNCH
ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE YOU'LL SEE THE ABA QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE
AND THESE ARE THE AREAS OF THE BODY THAT SWING FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND GO UP AND DOWN
AND WHEN I'M DONE WITH THAT SIDE I'LL STAY THERE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES BUT WHEN I'M DONE I'LL LET GO RELEASE MY HEAD UP MY ARM OUT AND AROUND COMING BACK DOWN
AS YOU DRY YOUR HAIR AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO SIMPLY DO IT THE EXACT SAME WAY YOU WOULD IN HOW YOU WANT TO STYLE IT TO SIDE SWEEP IT OR ANYTHING ELSE AND YOU WOULD STRAIGHTEN IT EXACTLY HOW YOU'D LIKE
IT MAY NOT ACTUALLY GO FLAT UNTIL YOU GET OUT ON THE ROAD AND IT ACTUALLY HAS SOME SERIOUS PRESSURE UNDER IT AND THEN YOU'LL END UP FIXING ANOTHER FLAT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THAT'S NO GOOD
WE DON'T WANT TO TWIST TO THE SIDE TO LOAD THE DOMINANT SIDE
BASICALLY ALL YOU WANT TO DO ON YOUR WIRE IS YOU ARE GOING TO GET YOUR UTILITY KNIFE AND THIS IS A LITTLE TRICKY BUT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PUT ONE SIDE OF THE BLADE NEXT TO YOUR WIRE AND PUT YOUR THUMB ACROSS THE BLADE AND IN A CIRCULAR MOTION RUN THE BLADE IN A CIRCLE
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THAT CONCAVE YOU CAN'T REALLY JUST TURN IT TO THE SIDE AND GET THE MIDDLE BECAUSE THE BOTTOM IS NOT THERE
SO YOU HAVE TO TURN THE BLOCK A LITTLE TO THE SIDE TO FIT INSIDE THIS SHAPE OF THE CONCAVE
THEY DON'T WORK SO WELL THEY WORK THEY DON'T WORK SO WELL WITH THESE KINDS OF LIGHTS BECAUSE YOU ADJUST THEM ON THE SIDE
HERE I LET THE ARM REST ON THE TABLE AND WORK THE FRONT SIDE OF IT OR THE BICEP
NOW PALM OPEN YOUR HANDS UP ALL THE FINGERS TOUCH THUMB TOUCHES EACH SIDE OF YOUR FINGERS
I MEAN IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE EQUIDISTANT ON EACH SIDE OF THE LINES
NOW THE OTHER SIDE
FIRST STEP TO THE SIDE AND TOUCH OUR FOOT TO THE GROUND
WE'RE GOING TO RUN HIM FROM SIDE TO SIDE WE'RE GOING TO RUN HIM OFF SOME SCREENS ALLOW HIM TO COME UP IN THE HIGH POST AREA AND SHOOT AS WELL
ONCE HE MAKES IT THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE AT THAT POINT IT'S VERY CRITICAL THAT YOU REALLY MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD ABOUT HIS VICTORY
NOW AS YOUR COMING TOWARDS THE PLATE YOU WANT YOUR MOMENTUM TO BE FULLY ON YOUR FRONT SIDE NORMALLY ON YOUR SHOULDERS AND EVERYTHING AS IF YOU WERE FALLING FORWARD
SO YOU CAN EMBOSS PATTERNS ONTO THE PLATE AND THEY WILL SHOW UP ON THE OTHER SIDE SO THAT WHEN YOU'RE USING THE IRON WITH THE WAX AND YOU'RE LAYING DOWN AND PICKING IT UP YOU'RE GETTING THIS LITTLE PATTERN TRANSFERRED ONTO THE WAX
APPLY IN A SIDE MOTION WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SQUIGGLE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PIGMENT IS MAKING GOOD CONTACT WITH THE CANVAS
IT LOOKS ALMOST LIKE A DOUBLE FAN AND THAT IS THE WINGS OF OUR DRAGON AND YOU'LL PUT A FAIR AMOUNT OF GLUE PUT IT FROM HALFWAY THROUGH ONE ALL THE WAY DOWN THE SIDE LIKE THIS
YOU'RE GOING TO SPREAD THIS BLUE LAYER ALL THROUGHOUT THE SKY AREA USING A SIDE TO SIDE MOTION AND MAKING SURE YOU GET PLENTY OF PIGMENT
WE DON'T WANT TO USE ANY ENGLISH TO SQUIRT THE CUE BALL OFF ONE SIDE OF THE OTHER
YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO CHOOSE YOUR SETTINGS TABS ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE
YOU WANT TO SLIT AND WEAVE ONE SIDE OF THE SCARF BEFORE YOU DO THE OTHER SIDE SO THAT YOUR HOLES DON'T SHIFT WHILE YOU'RE WORKING ON ANOTHER SIDE
USUALLY YOU POINT THE LIGHT INTO THE REFLECTIVE SIDE AND IT ACTUALLY WORKS AS A REALLY NICE SOFT BOX
AND SO RIGHT NOW THIS TABLE IF YOU LOOK THE WORDS DON'T BUMP ALL THE WAY UP AGAINST THE LEFT HAND SIDE
I SPRAY IT TO THE BACK OF THE PIECE OF PAPER THAT HAS MY PATTERN ON THE OTHER SIDE THEN I STICK IT ON THE STEEL SO THAT IT'S STUCK ON THERE PRETTY GOOD
ALSO YOU CAN SIDE STEP AND WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS JUST FOCUS ON THIS AT HOME AND HAVE AN AREA OF YOUR HOUSE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO USE A COURT JUST DO THE FOUR STEP THREE STEP AND THE TWO STEP AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT YOU CAN START COVERING THIS AREA VERY EFFICIENTLY AND THAT IS THE KEY TO A GOOD GAME SO WORK YOUR STEPS BREAK THE GAME DOWN INTO THESE LITTLE BITE SIZE CHUNKS AND YOU WILL SEE YOUR MOVEMENT SKILLS REALLY IMPROVE
THEN YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT TO THE OTHER SIDE KEEPING THE BELLY BUTTON ALWAYS STEADY FACING FRONT KEEPING THAT TUCKED
IN THIS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE I HAVE THE GRIP AND BRAKE LEVER ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HANDLE BARS I HAVE SOMETHING TO WORK WITH
I JUST SHOWED YOU HOW TO ANCHOR YOURSELF I CAN ANCHOR MYSELF HERE AND DO SOME KNEE LIFTS EXTENSIONS STRAIGHT OUT TO THE SIDE
SAME THING ON THIS SIDE FROM THE TOP POINT TO THIS POINT FOLD IT DOWN
GREAT TECHNIQUE STRIKE WITH THE HEEL AND THAT'S THE BACK LEG SIDE KICK
SO AS I AM DOING THIS TECHNIQUE I AM PROTECTING AGAINST A POTENTIAL COUNTER ATTACK BY KEEPING MY ELBOW IN THE CENTER SO I AM HERE STRAIGHT THROUGH BACK LEG SIDE KICK
AS THIS LEG IS COMING THROUGH I WANT TO TAKE THIS FOREARM AND LEAD WITH IT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET HIT IN THE STOMACH WITH HIS SIDE KICK ON THE WAY IN
SHOULDERS ARE RELAXED THE SHOULDER IS GOING TO COME ALL THE WAY THROUGH BACK LEG SIDE KICK
IT USED TO BE THE CAPTIVE BEAD RING BUT SINCE THEY DISCOVERED THAT IT DOESN'T MOVE FROM SIDE TO SIDE AS MUCH AND THERE IS NOT AS MUCH IRRITATION
FROM THERE LIFTING UP GRAB THAT ANKLE ONE SIDE HOLD THAT FOR FIFTEEN SECONDS
I'M JUST GOING TO REACH UP CLASPING THE HANDS TILTING TO ONE SIDE STRETCHING OUT MY LATS THE OTHER SIDE
YOU WANT TO HAVE A MAIN LIGHT JUST TO ONE SIDE OF THE MODELS FACE THEN YOU WANT TO EITHER HAVE A SECOND LIGHT OR A BIG WHITE BOUNCE CARD TO BOUNCE THE LIGHT BACK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MODELS FACE
IF YOU'RE A LEFT HANDER YOU MAY WANT TO START ON THE LEFT SIDE AS IT'S PROBABLY EASIER TO WORK LEFT TO RIGHT FOR YOU GUYS
PLACE MY COMB IN THE SIDE OF THE HEAD OR THE SIDE BACK OF THE HEAD AND SEE WHERE THE COMB STARTS TO COME OFF OF THE HEAD FOR ME
MOVE OVER TO THE NEXT SECTION AND MIRROR THE LINE THAT I CREATED ON THE RIGHT SIDE FOR THE LEFT SIDE
MY GUIDE WILL ACTUALLY SLIP JUST SLIGHTLY THROUGH MY FINGERS AND I'LL BE ABLE TO CUT THE HAIR ON THE LEFT SIDE
SINCE I'M RIGHT HANDED AND I WORK RIGHT TO LEFT I'LL GO BACK TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND CREATE ANOTHER HORIZONTAL LINE SUB SECTIONING MY RIGHT BACK SECTION
SO JUST GIVE IT A LITTLE CRUNCH FROM THE CORE AND THEN TWIST OVER TO THE SIDE
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO REPEAT THAT ON THE OTHER SIDE LIKE SO
IT COMES OVER AND THE STRING AS IT DOES THIS IT'S GOING TO WHIP AROUND THE SIDE OF YOUR WRIST
SAME THING ON THIS SIDE MAKING SURE THE POINTS MEET POINT
INSIDE REVERSE FOLD THAT POINT THAT WE JUST MADE AND SAME THING ON THIS SIDE INSIDE REVERSE FOLD THAT POINT
IT'S GOING TO BE ON THE LEFT SIDE
SO TO TAKE THIS THING OFF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS THERE'S A BUTTON ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CAMERA IF YOU'RE FACING THE BACK OF THE CAMERA
EMIL LAMPRECHT NOW THIS NEXT TRICK IS ANOTHER THAT'S GOOD TO UNDERSTAND THROUGH SIDE SWAPS
I'LL DO IT ONE SIDE OF PATTERN FOR YOU TO SEE
NOW THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS TRICK IS THAT IT TRANSITIONS VERY WELL INTO OTHER SIDE SWAPS
BECAUSE IT'S SIXES INSTEAD OF SEVENS OR FOURS IT HAS A NICE DIFFERENT LOOK THAN IF YOU WERE DOING A 7441 OR A 7401 OR A 741 WHICH ARE BOTH SIDE SWAPS I'LL GO OVER IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO COME INTO PLAY WHEN YOU'RE THINKING IN TERMS OF LETTER SIZES OR HOW LONG A WORD IS GOING TO BE BECAUSE THAT'S TAKING YOU WAY INTO THE DIGITAL SIDE OF YOUR BRAIN AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THERE
AND YOU WANT TO USE JUST A FEW LITTLE THREADS FROM YOUR PANTS SO IT DOESN'T SHOW ON THE OTHER SIDE
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT FORM THE OTHER SIDE YOU'RE NOT SEEING ANY OF THE STITCHING
AND I'VE ALREADY SET THE SAW UP WITH A SPOT DOWN HERE THAT'S EIGHTEEN INCHES FROM THIS SIDE OF THE BLADE
SO IF MY TEAM WERE TO SERVE THE BALL AND WE GET AN IN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE COURT WE GET IT IN THE SQUARE AND ON THE GROUND WE GET A POINT
THE FIRST WAY IS CALLED TRADITIONAL OR SIDE OUT SCORING
TYPICALLY IN TRADITIONAL OR SIDE OUT SCORING THE GAME GOES TO FIFTEEN OR ELEVEN
THE ONLY WAY IN TRADITIONAL OR SIDE OUT SCORING YOU CAN GET A POINT IS IF YOU SERVE THE BALL
AND THE STARTING WITH THE LARGEST PETAL YOU WANT TO TAKE THE TWO FLAPS ON EITHER SIDE OF THAT SLICE AND FOLD IT OVER LIKE THIS
OKAY THIS IS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DECK AND AGAIN WE HAVE SPONGY ROTTED TWO BY SIX REDWOODS HERE AND A LOT OF TIMES YOU CAN JUST CUT OUT A FOUR FOOT SECTION AND REPLACE WHERE IT'S BAD AND OF COURSE SCREW THAT DOWN
AGAIN STARTING IN NEUTRAL KNEES SOFT ABDOMEN PULLED IN TIGHT ARMS DOWN BY YOUR SIDE
SO YOU CAN DO IT TO ONE SIDE COME BACK IN NEUTRAL AND THEN GO TO THE OTHER SIDE
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN AND YOU START TO MOVE BOTH YOUR ARMS OVER TOWARDS THE RIGHT SIDE PALMS ARE GOING TO FACE FORWARD TURNING THE SPINE AND THE WAIST AND COMING DOWN BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE
THERE'S EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL SIDE
IF YOU HAVE A LOCAL TRIATHLON CLUB IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A LAKE WHEN YOU ARE AT THE BEACH PUT ON YOUR WET SUIT AND GET OUT THERE AND TO FEEL THAT FEELING OF THAT WATER HITTING YOU AND EITHER DIVING THROUGH THE WAVES AND BREAKING THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE OR JUST ROLLING WITH IT AND GET COMFORTABLE WITH IT
OKAY IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO COVER REMOVING THE DRIVER'S SIDE SEATBELT FASTENERS AND BASICALLY THEY'RE FASTENED WITH TWO BOLTS AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE A SEVENTEEN MILLIMETER HEAD
FOR ANGLE WISE I'LL SHOW YOU ON THE PASSENGER SIDE GIVES A LITTLE BIT BETTER VIEW FROM OUR CURRENT FILMING LOCATION
YOU CAN ALWAYS PLAY TENNIS ON THE SIDE OF A WALL OR A BACKBOARD SO A TENNIS COURT IS DEFINITELY OPTIONAL WHEN IT'S COMING TO PLAYING TENNIS
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TILT THE STAFF TO AN ANGLE SO THEY SMASH GO UP THIS WAY AND NATURALLY THE STAFF DIVERTS TO THE SIDE AND FROM HERE YOU GO IN WITH WHATEVER TECHNIQUE YOU WANT TO USE SO ONCE AGAIN ONE FROM THE ANGLE STRAIGHT DOWN TILT
NOW BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON UP HERE YOU CAN FOLD IT INTO ITSELF THAT WAY BUT THEN WHAT YOU'VE GOT ON THE BACK SIDE ARE TWO LITTLE LEGS FLOPPING AROUND SO WHAT I DO IS PUT THE LEGS ON THE INSIDE
THIS LOOKS LIKE A P IT HANDS DOWN ON THE LEFT SIDE THE LONG PART
HAMMER STRIKE ONE BUMP THIS HAND GOES OUT TO THE SIDE OPPOSITE HAND COMES FORWARD OVER HER HEAD BENDING ELBOW
GOOD WRIST IS STRAIGHT ARM IS BACK DOWN THIS WAY RELAXED HERE AT THE SIDE
BOTH ARMS RELAXED DOWN BY YOUR SIDE DROPPING THIS ONE
IT'S A MAIN DISH THAT WE CAN SERVE WITH WHATEVER KIND OF SIDE DISHES WE WANT
SO YOU HAVE TO USE A HIGH ACCELERATED NITROGEN LIKE AN EIGHTEEN SIX TWELVE NINETEEN FIVE NINE OR 21 SEVEN FOURTEEN EVERY TWO TO THREE WEEKS THROUGHOUT THE GROWING SEASON JUST PUT IT ON THE SIDE OF THE PLANT AND WATER IT IN REAL WELL
OTHER THING FOR THOSE OF YOU INTERESTED IN IT SIDE LUNGES WORK THE ADDUCTOR'S THE INNER THIGH MUSCLES A LOT
THE EASIEST WAY TO START LIFTING AROUND THE SIDE YOU CAN HEAR IT KIND OF SNAP CRACKLE AND POP HERE
SO THAT'S THE PROPER WAY TO PERFORM THE LEANING SIDE KICK
BUT AGAIN LET YOUR HANDS RELAX BY YOUR SIDE
SO OUR NEXT STRETCH IS GOING TO BE CALLED SIDE TO SIDE
YOU'RE GOING TO REACH UP AND OVER ON THE LATERAL SIDE
SO REACH UP AND OVER TOWARDS YOUR RIGHT SIDE
WE'RE NOW WE'RE BOUNCING STEP AND HIP LITTLE JUMP SIDE
FROM THE SIDE KNEES SLIGHTLY BENT TO START WITH AND LIFT LIFT JUST BY STRAIGHTENING THAT KNEE
I COULD ALSO TAKE DIFFERENT I COULD ADD PLUG-INS REMOVE PLUG-INS AND SIDE CHAIN DIFFERENT PLUG-INS DEPENDING ON WHERE I'M AT
THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO ACTUALLY LEAN FORWARD AND REACH FOR YOUR TOE WITH YOUR HAND THAT IS ON THE SAME SIDE
HI MY NAME IS DAN SCHMIDT FROM THE CHINESE MARTIAL ARTS CENTER AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE SHOWING YOU THE PROPER LEAN AWAY SIDE KICK
THE SAME THING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE BUT POINTING YOUR FINGERS UP GRAB ON TOP AND PULL BACK
OKAY RELAX AND REPEAT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
IF YOU NEED TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR BALANCE YOU CAN EITHER PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE FRONT OR HANDS ON THE SIDE
WHEN I THROW A BACK LEG SIDE KICK I'M GOING TO COME RIGHT AT YOU WITH IT SO GET READY
THIS IS THE BACK LEG SIDE KICK
OKAY NOW WE HAVE OUR BLANCHED ASPARAGUS TIPS AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT THOSE TO A SIDE IN A BOWL AND I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO EMPTY THIS BOWL RIGHT NOW
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IF YOU'RE OUTSIDE OF THE LANE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE LANE WHEN YOU'RE UP MORE TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE KEY YOU DON'T WANT TO USE THE BACKBOARD SHOT
IF YOU WANT TO CUT THE BALL TO THE RIGHT AND YOU'RE A RIGHT HANDED PITCHER YOU WOULD CUT THE BALL IN HALF AND POSITION BOTH FINGERS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BALL
AND TAKE IT TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE WHERE THE LEFT FOOT GOES OUT OFF THE SIDES OF THE MAT TAKE THAT KNEE RIGHT DOWN INTO THE MAT
THERE'S THE SIDE BALANCE
THIS IS HOW WE PERFORM OUR TRANSITION KICK PUNCH TO SCRAPE BLOCK SIDE PUNCH
COMES ALL THE WAY IN PULLS IN CHAMBER SIDE PUNCH
NOTICE SHE IS LAYING ON HER SIDE AND SHE IS RELAXED
NOW ONCE YOU'VE GOT YOUR ACRYLIC APPLIED LOOK AT IT FROM THE SIDE YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT FROM THE BOTTOM
JUST KIND OF SWEEP IT OFF TO THE SIDE
NOW IF YOU WANTED TO ADD AN EXTRA CHALLENGE YOU COULD ACTUALLY REACH OVER TO THE SIDE COME DOWN TO THE CENTER YOU COULD CROSS AND COME BACK TO CENTER AND JUST STEP IT UP JUST A LITTLE BIT
AND THEN THE FACT THAT IT'S WITH FACING MEANS THAT THIS LINE OF YOUR NECK THEN BECOMES THE STITCH LINE FOR A PIECE MIRRORING THIS TO BE PLACED ON TOP RIGHT SIDE TO RIGHT SIDE STITCHED ALONG THE HEART AND THEN FLIPPED INSIDE OUT FLIPPED INTO THE INTERIOR OF IT AND THEN IRONED ALONG THIS LINE WHICH JUST ALLOWS FOR A CLEAN FINISH AND ALLOWS FOR THE SHAPE TO BE RETAINED WITHOUT STRETCHING OUT THE FABRIC
NOW I CHOSE A SIDE PONYTAIL
AND FOR PATRICIA WE'RE GOING TO SHOW HOW TO DO A SLEEK PONYTAIL WITH A LITTLE BIT OF JEWELS ON THE SIDE
THE OTHER SIDE I FOLD ANOTHER TRIANGLE WHICH KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A COLLAR
ON THE FOLD SIDE HERE THIS IS WHERE I AM GOING TO MAKE MY FIRST CUT
YOU CAN EVEN TAKE A BRUSH TO FADE IT WITH YOU COULD TAKE THE SIDE OF THIS BRUSH AND IT BLENDS IT REALLY NICE
THAT LIKE YOU HAVE A CLASSIC TRENCH COAT THAT FOLDS OVER AND HOLDS ITSELF TOGETHER ON THE SIDE NOT IN THE CENTER
DROP DROP DROP AND THE OTHER SIDE DROP DROP DROP
FROM THE SIDE DROP YOUR KNEE'S GOING TO COME OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE TO ALLOW THAT HIP TO DROP
SO AGAIN TO BRING THE LIFT LIFT LIFT LIFT STRAIGHTEN YOUR LEG A LITTLE BIT MORE AND LIFT ON THE OTHER SIDE
FROM FORWARD FACING AGAIN DROP ON THE OTHER SIDE DROP DROP AGAIN I'M JUST FORCING THE KNEE OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE
BASICALLY IF YOU CLICK AND DRAG YOU HAVE TO DRAG OUT TO THE SIDE DEPENDING ON HOW FAR FROM THE ORIGINAL POINT THESE HANDLES ARE WILL DEPEND ON HOW WIDE YOUR ARCH IS GOING TO BE
THE DIFFERENCE IN A MAN'S CATWALK OR STYLISH WALK AS WE LIKE TO REFER TO IT IS THAT THEY KEEP THE FEET SIDE BY SIDE
AND THEY'RE GOING OUT TO THE SIDE
I KINDA JUST USE THE WINDOW OVER HERE AS A REFERENCE POINT BECAUSE THE WINDOW IS COMING IN FROM HERE SO I LIKE MY HIGHLIGHT TO BE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ROOM
AND SO WHAT I'M DOING IS ALL THE HIGHLIGHTS AS YOU CAN SEE I'VE PUT ON THE TIRES TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROOM
AND THEN WE CAN INHALE OURSELVES BACK INTO VADRASANA REPEATING THE POSE ON YOUR OPPOSITE SIDE
FEET SIDE BY SIDE AND WALKING BACK
BRING YOUR FEET HIP DISTANCE APART YOUR HANDS ARE DOWN BY YOUR SIDE AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A NICE INHALE AND EXHALE ROCK THAT PELVIS BACK SO THAT THE LOWER BACK IS PRESSED INTO THE MAT AND FROM THERE KEEP PRESSING THE SPINE INTO THE MAT UNTIL YOU COME ALL THE WAY UP
FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES YOU'RE GOING TO GET UP PADDLING YOU'RE GOING TO FIND YOURSELF ACTUALLY DINGING THE SIDE OF THE BOARD WITH THE PADDLE
YOU CAN SWAP BACK AND FORTH EACH SIDE
TANTUI TO TRANSITION FROM RIGHT SIDE TO LEFT SIDE
SO HE IS NOW GOING TO BE DEMONSTRATING A SORT OF A SWING TO THE SIDE
FROM HERE I'M GOING TO BRING THE FOOT DOWN STEP OUT BOW THE RIGHT HAND PERFORMS SCRAPING BLOCK AND THEN THE BODY SNAPS INTO SIDE PUNCH
I'M JUST SQUEEZING IT AND THEN FLATTENING THE BOTTOM SO I'VE ESTABLISHING THE BOTTOM THE SIDE WALLS AND NOW WE'RE READY TO RIP IT UP BRING IT IN
SO YOU CAN TELL YOUR CHILD TO SPOT A NUMBER FIVE OR SPOT A NUMBER TWO AND THEN YOU CAN COLLECT ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE AND YOUR CHILD CAN COLLECT THESE NUMBERS ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR HEAD TURNED TO THE SIDE BUT YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO BE SPOTTING YOUR LANDING FOR THIS STEP
REMOVE THE WASHERS WE DO THE OTHER SIDE
IF WE WOULD HAD BEEN WORKING ON THE RIGHT SIDE THAT WOULD BE AN INHALE
SO I LIKE THEM TO MOVE A HEAD A LITTLE BIT WHILE THEY'RE MOVING TO THE SIDE
A TRUE SIDEPASS IS JUST MOVING RIGHT TO THE SIDE
SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO I'M GOING TO BE SIDEPASSING TO THE RIGHT SO IF YOU'LL NOTICE I'M GOING TO LIFT UP ON MY LEFT REIN AND BARELY UNTIL I CAN SEE THAT HORSE'S LEFT EYE ON THE LEFT SIDE I JUST WANT TO BRING THAT NOSE AROUND
IN THAT CASE YOU ALSO WANT TO DO THE OTHER SIDE AS WELL SO DO BOTH SHOULDER POINTS
SO WHAT I AM DOING NOW IS I AM GOING TO BRING THE KNEE ACROSS MY BODY AND THEN THRUST IT STRAIGHT INTO YOU WITH THE BACK LEG SIDE KICK
IT'S THE FIRST PLACE THAT YOU'LL BEGIN TO NOTICE IMBALANCES FROM THE RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR BODY TO THE LEFT SIDE OF YOUR BODY THE FRONT SIDE OF YOUR BODY TO THE BACK SIDE OF YOUR BODY
SO ON ONE SIDE YOU ARE GOING DOWN FROM THE TOP DOWN AND THEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE YOU ARE GOING FROM THE BOTTOM UP
I WANT TO ENGAGE THE SIDE OF MY OBLIQUE YOU ARE ALWAYS TWISTING INTO THE KNEE THAT IS IN FRONT
BECAUSE THEY'RE FINDING LESS EFFECTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT OR TAKING DIFFERENT PROCESSES TO BREW IT WITHOUT THE TOXINS OR NEURAL TOXINS THAT COME FROM WORMWOOD THAT REALLY GIVE THESE HALLUCINOGENIC EFFECTS OR SIDE EFFECTS TO THE DRINK
ON THE LEFT SIDE WE'LL HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF POSITIVE CASH FLOW ON THE RIGHT SIDE WE'LL HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF NEGATIVE CASH FLOW
THAT'S SIDE LUNGES
AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE I'M GOING TO REMOVE THIS FLAP IS UNDERNEATH
I TAKE THE ARMS AND I'LL FOLD THEM INWARD AND I'VE GOT MY HAND IN THERE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO CREATE A BIG CREASE IN THERE WHERE I'M FOLDING I WANT IT TO FOLD STRAIGHT AND FLAT AND AS YOU CAN SEE I'M MAKING A LITTLE BIT OF MARGIN USING HERE'S THE ARMPIT AND THIS WOULD BE YOUR SIDE OR FLANK OF THE SHIRT AND I'M PULLING IT TOWARDS THE MIDDLE THERE AND NOW WHAT I WOULD DO IN THIS CASE WOULD BE TAKE THE TAIL BRING IT UP AGAINST MAKING SURE I'M NOT CREATING NEW CREASES I'D PULL IT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE COLLAR SO THAT THE COLLAR HAS SOMETHING TO PROTECT IT ITS NOT JUST HANGING OUT THERE IN THE BREEZE BY ITSELF
THE WAY THAT YOU TELL WHAT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FABRIC IS IS THE BOLDER COLOR YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT THIS THE BACK YOU CAN SEE THE COLORS ARE NOT AS VIBRANT AND THIS IS THE FRONT
IT'S A LITTLE MORE OBVIOUS ON SOME FABRICS THAN ON OTHERS SO I'M SURE THOUGH THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHICH IS THE RIGHT SIDE
SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS PUT THE RIGHT SIDE UP LIKE THAT AND THEN GO AHEAD AND MATCH IF YOU HAVE A PATTERN LIKE THIS THAT HAS STRIPES OR ANY SORT OF PATTERN LIKE THIS BE SURE THAT YOU GO AHEAD AND MATCH THEM SO THAT THEY LOOK CORRECT WHEN YOU SEW IT TOGETHER ON BOTH SIDES OF THE PILLOW
BASICALLY IF YOU WANT TO DO A SIMPLE PYRAMID YOU'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE TWO NORMAL STUNTS SAY WE LEARNED THE GROUP HEEL STRETCH EARLIER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GIRL ON THE RIGHT SIDE DOING HER RIGHT HEEL STRETCH AND ONE STUNT GROUP OVER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER GIRL DOING HER LEFT HEEL STRETCH CO-JOINING IN THE MIDDLE
NOW I AM GOING TO MAKE THE LITTLE ARMS ON THE SIDE
SO TAKE A MARSHMALLOW AND JUST CUT ABOUT A QUARTER INCH AND THEN CUT IT IN HALF AND THEN YOU CAN TAKE OFF AND CUT IT A QUARTER OR LESS WHATEVER YOU LIKE AND JUST STICK THAT ON THE SIDE
YOU CAN CHANGE A RANGE OF MOTION TO GO TO THE SIDE AND YOU CAN ALSO INCORPORATE SOME BICEP CURLS AND TRICEP PRESSES
THE OTHERS ARE DONE WITH FREE WEIGHTS OR DUMB BELLS AND YOU CAN DO SIDE LATERAL RAISES SO STANDING WITH THE FEET HIP DISTANCE APART SOFTEN THE KNEES SHOULDERS BACK AND LIFT YOUR ARMS TO THE SIDE
YOU WANT TO STICK TO THE LIGHT SIDE TO MAKE YOUR GRID BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO SEE THE LINES
THEN I'M GOING TO STRIKE IT AND I SHOULD HAVE A LONG BLADE COME OFF ON THE BACK SIDE
IT IS POSSIBLE TO INSTALL THE WRONG ONE ON THE WRONG SIDE
SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ON THE BOTTOM SIDE HERE WE'RE GOING TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF HOT GLUE ALL AROUND IT
AND WHAT WE'LL DO NOW IS JUST DO SOME CORRIDORS GETTING TWO LINES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE SPACE
WE CAN GO AHEAD AND POUR THIS ON HERE AND SET THIS TO THE SIDE YOU WANT TO FLATTEN THIS OUT SO WHAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO IS TAKE THIS YOU CAN FOLD IT OVER THAT WAY YOU CAN MANIPULATE WHAT'S GOING ON AND PUSH THIS TO THE SIDE NOW WATCH OUT IT'S A BIT WARM YOU WOULD NOTICE IT FROM LOOKING AT IT BUT IT IS
IT ALSO WORKS GOOD IF WE HAVE A LINEBACKER ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT IS BLITZING AND WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE GETTING TO THE QUARTERBACK QUICKLY
THE SAME WITH THE OTHER SIDE
OF COURSE DO THE SAME ON THE OTHER SIDE
WHAT I'M DOING IS I'M PARTING IT AT ABOUT RIGHT ABOUT AT HER EAR LEVEL OVER HERE ON THIS SIDE
YOU ARE STILL LEFT HAND CHAMBERED AND STEP TO THE RIGHT SIDE OPEN THE RIGHT HAND PALM BLOCK
DOING IT STATIONARY YOU ARE GOING TO MOVE SIDE TO SIDE SO YOU ARE NOT REALLY STAYING IN PLACE
YOU ARE GOING TO STEP TO THE SIDE WITH YOUR LEFT FOOT PALM BLOCK
THE LEFT KNEE CAN GO A LITTLE WIDER OUT TO THE SIDE PLACE YOUR FINGERTIPS OUTSIDE YOUR HIPS WITH YOUR INHALATION LENGTHEN YOUR SPINE UP TOWARDS THE SKY
FOR INSTANCE WEATHER CAN BE DIFFERENT ON ONE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN THAN ON THE OTHER BUT WITH OUR MOTOR WE CAN FLY INTO BOTH
FOR BARREL RACING WHAT WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS MOVE THEM AHEAD AND TO THE SIDE AT THE SAME TIME
IF HE REALLY DOESN'T WANT TO GO GET A PARTNER ON THE SIDE OF THAT DOOR TO HELP YOU
AND THE THICKNESS OF THE SIDE SEAM
THAT INDICATES THAT THIS IS ONLY FOR THE DRIVER S SIDE OF THE VEHICLE
HOW YOU DETERMINE WHICH SIDE OF THE VEHICLE IT IS YOU PICTURE YOURSELF SITTING BEHIND THE STEERING WHEEL YOUR LEFT HAND IS GOING TO INDICATE THE LEFT SIDE AND YOUR RIGHT HAND IS GOING TO INDICATE THE RIGHT SIDE
NEXT YOU WANT TO IDENTIFY THE NAIL THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TRIM AND PRESS IT OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT SO IT SEPARATES FROM THE OTHER NAILS AND YOU WANT TO VISUALLY IF YOU CAN SEE THE QUICK GO AWAY FROM IT ON THIS SIDE
SO A COUPLE OF THE WAYS WE CAN DO THAT IS WE BEGIN WITH OUR ARMS LOOSELY BY THE SIDE
TAKE YOUR RIGHT ARM DOWN GET OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BODY BY REACHING UP WITH THAT LEFT HAND
ANOTHER VARIATION OF THE MANUAL IS A MANUAL TO FRONT SIDE 180 OUT
YOU OLLIE ONTO THE TOP HOLD THE MANUAL POSITION AND THEN JUST BEFORE YOU GET TO THE END INSTEAD OF ROLLING STRAIGHT OFF YOU'LL GOT FRONT SIDE 180 TO FAKIE
BUT SOMETHING ABOUT TAKING A TINY NEEDLE AND JABBING IT INTO THE SIDE OF YOUR FINGER TO DRAW BLOOD REALLY IS OFF PUTTING TO PEOPLE
ONE WHEN THIS GUARD PULLS OUT THAT WILL LEAVE A BIG HOLE ON THIS SIDE
AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO OUR NEXT ONE AND PLACE IT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND THE REASON WHY WE'RE PUTTING IT ON THE EACH OF THE SIDES FIRST IS BECAUSE THEN WHEN WE PUT OUR RIBBON ON THE TOP IT'S GOING TO CROSS OVER AND MAKE A NICE CORNER AND I LIKE WHEN CORNERS ARE LOOK ALL LIKE WE'VE PLANNED IT OUT AND WE HAVE
NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO A ROUNDHOUSE TO THE SIDE RIGHT HERE BAM
NOW AIMING IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO FOR THE SIDE YOU MIGHT HURT YOURSELF IF YOU ACTUALLY HIT IN THE HIP
AND IF YOU DO IT WITH A PARTNER WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS HAVE HER LIFT UP THE ARMS JUST VERY GENTLY WITHOUT HURTING HER YOU'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD GOING TO SIDE JUST LIKE THAT FOR THE AIMING
SO YOU ARE GOING TO CUT A LITTLE BIT OFF OF THIS SIDE AND A LITTLE BIT OFF OF THIS SIDE
YOU CAN OLLIE ON TO A SIDE WALK AND MANUAL YOU CAN DO A 180 INTO A MANUAL A KICK FLIP INTO A MANUAL OR START REALLY BASIC AND LEARN HOW TO DO A NOSE MANUAL
NOW ON THE OTHER SIDE WE HAVE HIS STRENGTH OR POWER DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU WANT TO CALL IT
NOTICE MY HANDS ARE NOT TO THE SIDE BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE CORRECT BODY POSITION
ALWAYS ERR ON THE SIDE OF TOO PROFESSIONAL IF YOU'RE UNCERTAIN
REMEMBER YOU'RE APPROACHING FROM YOUR HEEL SIDE THIS TIME ALSO SO IT'S GOING TO BE BLIND
SOMETIMES IF THERE IS A JUST A LITTLE BIT OF PINE NEEDLES JUST STICKING THROUGH I MIGHT PUSH IT THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN I'M DONE WITH THIS JOB OF CLEANING THE SCREEN ENCLOSURE I HAVE TO CLEAN THE POOL
NOW ONCE AGAIN YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE GROOVE SIDE BECAUSE IF YOU DO NOT THEN YOUR PIECES WILL NOT SLIDE TOGETHER
OKAY SO LET'S TRY IT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH OUR TOE I WANT YOU TO PICK IT UP YOU'RE JUST GOING TO JUMP DON'T CHEAT IT BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS GO LIKE THIS AND THAT WAS NOT OVER THE TOP THAT WAS ACROSS THE SIDE
IN HIGH WIND AREAS WE RECOMMEND THAT AN ADDITIONAL FASTENER BE PLACED THROUGH THE SIDE INTO THE FASCIA
IT'S A WAY OF AVOIDING A LOT OF TROUBLES IN YOUR WAY AND ALSO GETTING THE BALL IF THE GREEN IS HEAVILY BUNKERED AND THE PIN'S ON THE LEFT SIDE THIS IS A WAY OF TRACKING THE BALL TOWARD THE PIN
SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NOW THAT WE'RE GETTING INTO LONGER IRONS AND THEY'RE NOT QUITE AS LOFTED YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GENERATE MORE SIDE SPIN ON IT
SO YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE NORMAL UNDER SPIN OF STRIKING A BALL BUT WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE THE FACE LIKE THIS TO CREATE SOME SIDE SPIN SO THE BALL WILL SPIN AND GO TO THE LEFT
SO AGAIN YOU'RE PLACING THE BALL IN FRONT OF YOU PUSHING DOWN THROUGH THE HANDS EXTENDING OUT THROUGH THE HIPS AND THEN DRIVING THE ELBOWS INTO THE SIDE
SO A STRING OF CARS MOVING ALONG SIDE THE HIGHWAY CAN ACTUALLY LOOK JUST LIKE ONE BIG BLUR OF LIGHT COMING ALONG
SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO PUT A COUPLE OF SCREWS IN EACH SIDE THAT ARE GOING TO BE AN ANGLE GOING DOWNWARD INTO OUR HANDLE
NEXT I'M JUST GOING TO BE DRILLING A PILOT HOLE THROUGH MY SIDE INTO MY HANDLE
AND ANOTHER SCREW ON THE OTHER SIDE SHOULD DO IT
SO WHEN I DROP MY HANDS I USE THIS MOMENTUM TO BRING MY HIPS TO THE SIDE ALL THE WAY OVER
I ALWAYS REMEMBER SAYU UNDO LIKE TO THE SIDE OK
ONE TWO THREE BREATHE THIS ARM'S GOING ONE TWO THREE NOW YOU'RE BREATHING ON THE OTHER SIDE
AND I USUALLY PUT A LITTLE TICK MARK ON THE SIDE THAT'S GOING TO BE CUT AWAY THEN SO I KNOW WHICH LINE WHICH SIDE OF THE LINE TO CUT ON
AND THE SAME GOES FOR THE INSIDE LOOP OF THE CAR END OF THE TERMINAL THE FEMALE SIDE
YOU CAN EITHER USE A PAPER CUTTER OR I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS SQUARE BY FOLDING IT DIAGONALLY RIGHT TO THE POINT OVER ON THIS SIDE AND MATCH THE EDGES EXACTLY TO HERE AND THEN JUST FOLD THAT RIGHT IN HALF
ALRIGHT CONTINUING WITH LEARNING HOW TO JUGGLE SIDE SWAPS
WHEN YOU SEE A PATTERN A SIDE SWAP PATTERN THAT YOU CAN FOLLOW IT WILL JUST BE A STRING OF NUMBERS
NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF COOLER PATTERNS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SIDE SWAP IS TO FIGURE OUT THE COOLER PATTERNS
THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO START BECAUSE THEY CAN UTILIZE THE SUPPORT OF SIDE WALKERS EASIER AS WELL AS THEIR LEGS DON'T HAVE TO BE IN THE DOWN POSITION TO BE ABLE TO RIDE
I'LL SHOW YOU FROM THIS SIDE
THE SWEET SPOT IS WHERE YOU FIND THAT EXACT SPOT WHERE YOU ARE BALANCING YOU ARE NOT LEANING TO FAR FORWARD OR TO FAR BACK OR FROM SIDE TO SIDE
YOU CAN ADD IT IN TO YOUR FORMS OR INTO YOUR COTTAS OR ANYTHING THAT YOU MAKE UP IS JUST TO TAKE THE BO STAFF SPIN IT AROUND AND TAKE ONE HAND OFF CATCH IT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND JUST CONTINUE TO FLIP LEFT OR RIGHT HAND WHICHEVER YOU START OUT WITH
OF COURSE IT IS ASKING US TO RESET THE COMPUTER BUT AS YOU'VE NOTICED THE TEST ON THE DESKTOP OVER HERE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY
OUR WIRE IS GOING TO COME OUT THIS SIDE AND WE ARE GOING TO ATTACH THE WIRE TO A CLOSURE
REALLY CONFINE THE STROKE TO THAT AREA DON'T MOVE FURTHER DOWN THE HORSE'S BACK OR ON TO THE HORSE'S SIDE THEY ARE NOT GOING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT YOU ARE DOING UNTIL THEY ARE FULLY WARMED UP
AND I PUT ALL MY VANILLA WAFERS INSIDE OF THE BOTTLE AND THE GENIUS THAT I AM AND I GUESS EXPERIENCE AND THE HANDS-ON REALLY TEACHES US AS WE GO BUT I HAD PUT THE GEL AFTER I HAD PUT THE WAFERS IN AND IT WAS STUCK TO THE SIDE OF THE BOTTLE AND I WENT AND CHECKED ON IT IN THE MICROWAVE AND I LOOKED OVER AND MY BOTTLE WAS TOTALLY TOTALLY DISTORTING ITSELF AND SO THAT SPOT THAT I KEEP SHOWING YOU GUYS ON THIS PARTICULAR BOTTLE THAT WAS WHERE MY FOOD COLORING WAS ATTACHED TO THE SIDE OF IT AND IT WAS THE TEXTURE OR WHATEVER THE FOOD COLORING GEL IS MADE OF IT WAS BURNING MY BOTTLE MY BOTTLE WAS WITHERING AWAY IN MY MICROWAVE AND I WAS LUCKY TO CATCH IT IN TIME SO THAT I DIDN'T COMPLETELY DESTROY MY BOTTLE BUT ALL RIGHT SO THANKS FOR LISTENING TO MY SAD STORIES HERE WE GO
THE WOLVERINE JIG ARE THESE TWO SECTIONS THAT ARE MOUNTED RIGHT BENEATH THE TWO GRINDING WHEELS AND ON ONE SIDE WE HAVE A FLAT TOOL REST THAT SLIDES IN AND OUT AND UNDER THIS ONE A V-ARM THAT SLIDES IN AND OUT
AGAIN PLACING THE FINGERS WIDE HANDS TO THE FLOOR AND YOUR LEFT KNEE ON THE UPPER TRICEP BACK SIDE OF THE ARM OF THE RIGHT ARM
BRING YOUR HEEL UNDERNEATH THE HIP CROSS THE LEFT LEG OVER SO WE'RE READY FOR THE OTHER SIDE
WE'RE GOING TO DO THE SECOND SIDE OF THAT VARIATION ON TWISTING CROW POSE
YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THIS SIDE OF THE HATCH COVER IS BEVELED AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT'S PUT BACK IN SO THAT THE BEVEL IS POINTING DOWN ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOAT OR OUTSIDE OF THE CABIN
AND TO DO THAT I'VE ISOLATED EACH FACE AND PUT THEM ON DIFFERENT LAYERS SO THAT THE TOP LAYER IS THE FRONT VIEW AND THE BOTTOM LAYER IS THE SIDE VIEW
IF THE BASKETBALL IS GOING OFF THE LEFT SIDE YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACK THE LEFT SIDE
IF THE BALL GOES OFF THE RIGHT RIDE YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACK THE RIGHT SIDE
SO I START WITH MY REGULAR SIX-FOUR POSITION I DRAW MY LEFT FOOT IN AND NOW I STEP TO THE SIDE ONE TWO
BUT IT'S REALLY THE EMOTIONAL OR THE SPIRITUAL SIDE
YOU ARE JUST GOING TO TAKE YOUR BUFFING PAD AND GO IN FAN MOTIONS DOWN THE BOARD AND IF YOU ARE DOING THE COMPLETE FAN PATTERN ACROSS THE SNOW BOARD YOU CAN GO TO THE OTHER SIDE AND GO THE OPPOSITE WAY SO IT REPELS THE WATER OFF TO THE SIDE
I WILL DEMONSTRATE ON ONE SIDE OF THE SNOWBOARD THE STRAIGHT BACK BUFFING PATTERN YOU JUST WANT TO TAKE YOUR BUFFING PAD PRESS IT PRETTY FIRM AND PULL IT STRAIGHT BACK ALONG THE SNOWBOARD
WHEN YOU DO THE TOSS YOU SHIFT THE WEIGHT FROM YOUR RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR BODY TO YOUR LEFT SIDE OF YOUR BODY AND YOU JUST BRING YOUR ARM UP
SO FROM HERE I SLIDE UP SIDE KICK REVERSE PUNCH REAR LEG ROUND KICK
SO I SLIDE UP BASE MY BODY KEEP MY BODY LEVEL HERE KEEP MY HANDS UP THROW THE RIGHT LEG LEAD SIDE KICK STEP FORWARD SHIFT REVERSE PUNCH TURN THE FOOT OUT
LIFT THE LEG OUT THROW THE SIDE KICK
AT THIS POINT YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND STITCH THE REST OF THE WAY DOWN THE SIDE
AND THEN YOU WILL DO THE OTHER THING ON OR THE SAME THING ON THE OTHER SIDE
LAY ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR POLE YOUR RIGHT LEG COMES UP
WE'RE DOING THEM TO THE SIDE BRING THEM ON UP
SO YOU WANT YOUR WEIGHT TO BE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED CAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO SIDE TO SIDE
NOW DROP YOUR HAND TO THE SIDE
INHALE WITH THE RIGHT ARM AND EXHALE SIDE STRETCHING TO THE LEFT
STAYS ON THE RIGHT SIDE
IN THE RIGHT HAND SIDE WE HAVE THE LEVER THAT CONTROLS THE DOSING CHAMBER AND THE SWITCH TO TURN IT ON
SO QUESTIONS CAN GET FACTS WHICH WILL HELP YOU AND IT CAN CAUSE THE OTHER SIDE TO GIVE THINGS AWAY WHICH CAN BE BENEFICIAL TO YOUR PARTY
A LITTLE BIT LOOSER ON THIS SIDE FEELS GOOD
I'M GOING TO USE THE PURPLE SIDE OUT FOR MY HEART
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS SIDE
NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND STRETCH THE LEFT SIDE
ONE OF THE FIRST RULES ABOUT SETTING UP CAMPFIRE SEATING IS YOU WANT TO SETUP YOUR SEATING ON THE UP WIND SIDE OF THE FIRE SO PEOPLE AREN'T HAVING TO BREATHE THE SMOKE FROM THE FIRE THAT'S BEING BLOWN DOWN WIND
LET'S JUST SAY YOU HAD A NICE KILLER HEART SUIT FOR EXAMPLE AND SOME SIDE ACES
SO THE BREATH IS GOING FRONT AND BACK SIDE TO SIDE AND TOP TO BOTTOM
WHICH IN THIS CASE EACH SIDE IS ABOUT EIGHT INCHES
SO FLIP IT RIGHT SIDE UP TO THE SMOOTH SIDE AND THEN GET AN AREA MOIST THAT'S GOING TO BE IN FAR ENOUGH TO BE AS SMALL AS THIS SQUARE IS HERE
NOW THIS IS THE BOTTOM SIDE OF MY BOTTOM PIECE
SO LET ME SHOW YOU ON THE SIDE LIKE THIS AND THEN WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO END UP DOING IS POINTING IT OUT FORTY-FIVE DEGREES AND THEN CLOSING IN ON A FULL CIRCLE BUT THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO ON THE FROG KICK IS JUST BRING YOUR HEEL STRAIGHT UP TO YOUR BUTT LIKE THAT
THEN YOU ARE GOING TO NEED TO MEASURE OUR BUTTER BUTTER IF YOU DON'T KNOW HAS TABLESPOONS MARKED ON THE SIDE SO WE'RE GOING TO USE TWO TABLESPOONS OF BUTTER
MAYBE WITH A FEW CURLS DOWN ON THE SIDE
SO I ENGAGE MY HAMSTRING AND GLUTE TO CREATE THE ACTION INSTEAD OF ENGAGING THE THE FOOT MUSCLES IN THE TOES AND THEN I'LL DO THE SAME THING ON THE OTHER SIDE SOFTEN AND SPREAD THE TOES CREATE LENGTH THROUGH THE ANKLE AND THEN ENGAGE FROM THE GLUTE AND THE HAMSTRING
SAME THING WITH THE OTHER SIDE
SO YOU JUST WANT TO TURN YOUR BAG BACK RIGHT SIDE OUT
ONCE AGAIN GETTING INTO THE SIDE BALANCE
BALANCING ON ONE SIDE
AND COME INTO A SIDE BALANCING BOW
VERY GOOD OTHER SIDE VERY GOOD
IF IT'S GOT A COLOR ON THE SIDE THEN IT SCORES POINTS
AND SO WE'RE GOING TO PRESS IT SO THAT THE SEAM IS SORT OF TO ONE SIDE
SO A REALLY GOOD STRETCH IS TO REACH YOUR HANDS UP WAY OVER YOUR HEAD AND TO JUST LEAN TO ONE SIDE
AND WE ARE GOING TO PUT THAT ON THE SIDE AND I WANT IT TO BE VISIBLE SO YOU CAN SEE THE DIAMONDS
AGAIN THIS TECHNIQUE CAN BE PERFORMED ON EITHER SIDE SO THIS IS WITH THE RIGHT FOOT SO ONE TWO THREE IN TOWARDS THE FACE ONE MORE ONE TWO THREE JUST LIKE THAT
WHICH THIS SIDE WOULD BE EVEN ON THIS SIDE IT IS A THIRD AND THAT IS PRETTY CLOSE RIGHT THERE
SO THIS SIDE WE HAVE A TREBLE KEYBOARD WE WOULD PLAY THIS LATER AND THIS SIDE WE HAVE THE BASS PART OF THE ACCORDION THAT PLAYS THE ACCOMPANIMENT AND THESE TWO PARTS OF THE ACCORDION SUPPLIED BY AIR BY A BELLOW
SO YOU WANT TO PIN THE SIDE
YOUR LEFT FOOT IS GOING TO BE IN THE STIRRUP AND YOUR RIGHT LEG IS GOING TO COME OVER ONTO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HORSE
SO YOU WANT THEIR EYE-LINE TO GO A LITTLE BIT TO THE SIDE SO YOU'LL WANT TO SIT A LITTLE BIT TO THE SIDE OF THEM SO THEY CAN LOOK OFF
AND I'M GOING TO SIT JUST TO THE SIDE OF THE CAMERA SO THEY'RE NOT LOOKING DIRECTLY AT THE CAMERA BECAUSE THAT KIND OF LEAVES A REALLY AWKWARD FEEL TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE VIEWING THE VIDEO WHEN THE PERSON GETTING INTERVIEWED IS LOOKING DIRECTLY AT THEM
AND ONCE IT SETTLES YOU CAN TAP THE SIDE OF THE BUCKET JUST GENTLY AND THAT CAN URGE IT TO ITS FINAL POSITION
SO YOU START IN THAT MOUNTAIN POSE HANDS AT YOUR HEART CENTER OR DOWN AT YOUR SIDE WHICHEVER YOU PREFER ON AN INHALE YOU'RE GOING TO SCOOP UP AND ON EXHALE YOU'RE GOING TO FOLD FORWARD
THE HANDS CIRCLE DOWNWARD RELAXING AND THEY BOTH HIT TO THE SIDE OF YOUR THIGH OUT TO THE SIDE OF THE BODY ALL THE WAY UP
IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT THIS CHEMICAL IN THE WORMWOOD MAY CAUSE THE NERVE DAMAGE AND OTHER SIDE EFFECTS
FOLD THE OTHER SIDE IN
BEFORE YOU GO INTO PARK KNOW THAT THERE'S A ROAD ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE PARK AND KNOW THAT THERE'S A RIVER WITH MARINA ON IT
ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE PARK
IF I SHOW YOU THIS FROM THE SIDE YOU COULD SEE I'M STRAIGHT OUT AND NOT TO THE FRONT
AND ANOTHER BACK TACK AND MAKE SURE THAT THE SEAMS MATCH UP AT THE AT THE SIDE SEAMS AGAIN
ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AS WELL THERE WILL BE A BEAD ANY PART OF THE STICK RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE BALL IS GOING TO BE INSIDE AGAINST THE MILK CARTOON SO YOU REALLY WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING THE STICK DIRTY WHILE YOU'RE PAINTING IT
BECAUSE IN A PICTURE YOU'LL NOTICE THIS IS THE MIRROR IMAGE BUT YOU KNOW WELL SO WHAT YOU KNOW HIS THIS SIDE OF HIS FACE IS NOW OVER HERE NOT A BIG DEAL
THIS NEXT FUNCTIONAL CORE EXERCISE IS A SIDE PLANK ON YOUR FOREARM
KEEPING MY FINGER ON THE INSIDE SO I DON'T DAMAGE THE SHAPE OF THE MUG CURL IT OVER PLACE THE BOTTOM SIDE OF THE HANDLE AGAINST THE BOTTOM PART IN THE MUG AND PRESS IT DOWN LIKE SO
NOW I'M GOING TO TAKE MY SLIP SIMPLY PAINT IT ON ALL THE SPOTS TAKE THE TOP SIDE OF MY HANDLE AND PRESS IT AGAINST THE MUG LIKE SO
NOW I'M GOING TO REPEAT THE SCORING PROCESS THERE AND I'M GOING TO REPEAT THE SCORING PROCESS ON THE BACK SIDE OF MY HANDLE MAKING SURE IT'S NICE AND SCORED
YOU WANT IT TO BE BLENDED AND LET ME SEE YOUR OTHER SIDE SO JUST LIGHTLY SWEEP UNDERNEATH THE CHEEKBONE BACK AND FORTH AND MAKE SURE YOU GET IT ALL THE WAY INTO THE EAR SO YOU DON'T HAVE A LINE AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE FORGET THAT THEIR EARS ARE PART OF THE THEIR FACE AND IF YOUR EAR IS A DIFFERENT COLOR THEN YOUR FACE IT'S GOING TO LOOK A LITTLE FUNNY
SAME THING WITH THE OTHER SIDE HERE
JUST REALLY PULL THIS PART UP AND WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO YOU ARE TRYING TO BREAK THE BACK BONE RIGHT BACK HERE SO LET'S MARK THIS SIDE AND YOU WANT TO TO SNAP OUT THEN YOU ARE GONNA GET YOUR HAND DIRTY
SO I'VE JUST MOVED THE ZIPPER PART OVER A LITTLE SO I'M NOT I DON'T HAVE THE ZIPPER THICKNESS AND THE SIDE SEAM THICKNESS TO SEW OVER ALL AT ONCE
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU LEAVE OPEN JUST ENOUGH OF AN OPENING SO THAT YOU CAN TURN YOUR PLACE MAT RIGHT SIDE OUT
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FABRIC IS OBVIOUSLY THE FRONT
THE WRONG SIDE IS THE BACK
IF YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE THREE CLUB SECTION WE TALK ABOUT A FEW CLUB SIDE SWAPS
AND THE SAME GOES FOR THE FOREHAND SIDE SO INSTEAD OF THIS ARM GUARD IT'S LIKE THAT
NOW TO WORK ON THIS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET THIS CATCH DOWN AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE USED TO KICKING YOUR LEG UP AND CATCHING THE UNDERSIDE OF THE CRYSTAL STICK OR SORRY THE TOP SIDE OF THE CRYSTAL STICK ON THE UNDERSIDE OF YOUR LEG AT THE RIGHT BALANCE POINT SO THAT JUST SPINS OVER NICE AND EASY LIKE THAT
AFTER I PERFORM MY SIX TO EIGHT REPETITIONS I'M GOING TO DROP THE WEIGHT AND WITH THESE POWER BLOCKS I'LL ADJUST THE WEIGHT FIVE POUNDS DOWN ON EITHER SIDE
BUT ONE THING YOU WANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS WHEN YOU USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT HAS A SLOPED BACK YOU HAVE TO COME AROUND THE SIDE AND AGE ALL OF THIS
OTHERWISE THE WHOLE STYLE WILL BE COMPLETELY THROWN OFF IF YOU BRAID IS LEANING TOWARDS ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER
THAT'S THE PROPER WAY TO PERFORM SELF DEFENSE AGAINST A SIDE BEAR HUG
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH PENCIL WEIGHTS THEY GO FROM 9H AT ONE SIDE SO 9H IS OVER HERE TO 9H ON THE OTHER SIDE 9B ON THE OTHER SIDE
WHAT YOU WILL DO IS TURN SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR THUMB TO THE SIDE MID LINE OF THE BODY JUST LIKE IF YOU WERE HOLDING ON TO A GOLF CLUB
THE FURTHER AWAY I TAKE MY FOOT FROM THE BAND THE LESS RESISTANCE I'LL HAVE WORKING TEN TO FIFTEEN REPS THREE SETS ON EACH SIDE
NORMALLY WHEN YOU ARE SITTING DOWN YOU HAVE IT ALMOST DIRECTLY AGAINST THE SIDE MAYBE SLIGHTLY DOWN
THIS ONE THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS THE OPEN-TOE CUTOUT PLATFORM AND THIS SPACE HERE THE WHITE IS ACTUALLY A CUTOUT THAT IF YOU WERE TO LOOK THROUGH IT YOU'D SEE WHATEVER IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT
OK SO IF SOMEBODY GRABS YOU FROM THE SIDE GO LIKE THIS
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE SHOWING YOU PROPER SELF DEFENSE AGAINST A SIDE BEAR HUG
TO TAKE IT OFF WE JUST GOING TO UNDO THE LEG STRAPS UNDO THE BELLY STRAPS PULL TO THE SIDE
REMEMBER WE HAD THE ATHLETIC CROUCH BEFORE AND I MEAN FROM THE SIDE THERE ISN'T A LOT OF DIFFERENCE EXCEPT THAT WE STAND UP WE BRING OUR HIPS PELVIS UNDERNEATH OF US
YOU CAN ACTUALLY JUST COME UP WITH A SHEET OF FOAM CORE USE YOUR A-CLAMP CLAMP IT TO A LIGHT STAND AND YOU STILL HAVE YOUR UP AND DOWN CONTROLS JUST BY TIGHTENING AND LOOSENING THE COLLAR ON THE BACK SIDE AND YOU CAN MOVE THAT RIGHT IN BETWEEN THE LIGHT AND YOUR CAMERA
IF I CLIPPED IT TO THIS SIDE AND TO THE MIDDLE THEN THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WOULD BE THAT I WOULD TURN IT THE OTHER WAY THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO GET THE DESIRED EFFECT
SO YOU JUST CLIP IT TO ONE POINT ON THIS SIDE AND ONE ON THE MIDDLE AND LET'S FIRE IT UP
NOW YOUR GOING TO LIFT THAT UP SEE IT'S VERY SOFT AND WERE GOING TO TAKE OUR CENTER AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO WRAP THAT PEDAL AROUND THE CENTER AND REMOVE A BIT AT THE END AND WE'LL PUT THAT TO THE SIDE
I CAN PUT THEM SIDE BY SIDE TO GIVE YOU A CLUE TO WHICH ONE IS MORE CLEAR
YES AND FROM THERE I'M GOING TO STRETCH FORWARD AND BRING IT DOWN AND I'M GOING TO GO TO THE SIDE
AGAIN GIVING IT MORE OF A PROBABILITY TO LAND ON THAT SIDE
ANOTHER THING YOU COULD DO IS YOU COULD ACTUALLY TAKE THE DICE PUT IT IN AN OVEN FIND THE OPTIMUM TEMPERATURE TO DO SO AND THE DICE WILL ACTUALLY MELT AND SOME OF THE MATERIAL WILL ACTUALLY POOL UP ON THE BOTTOM THUS MAKING THAT SIDE OF THE DIE HEAVIER
DRILL DOWN AND YOU COULD ACTUALLY ADD SOME LEAD WEIGHTS INTO THE DICE SO IT WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO LAND ON THAT SIDE
ALRIGHT =I'M LOOKING OVER THE NAILS AND I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE COLORS THAT WE'VE GOT SO FAR AND I THINK I WANT TO ADD A TAD BIT OF RED SO I MIGHT JUST ON THE DRY BRUSH SIDE GET A LITTLE BIT OF THAT RED PAINT KNOCK SOME OF IT OFF AND JUST DO A TAD BIT
START WORKING YOUR WAY INWARD AND YOU WILL HEAR SOME BONES CRACK THOSE ARE RIBS AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE
AS THAT ARM IS MOVING BACK YOU'LL BREATHE TO THAT SIDE
TWO THREE BREATHE ON THAT SIDE
AS THIS WHICHEVER ARM IT MAY BE THAT'S THREE AS IT'S MOVING BACK PULLING YOU WANT TO BREATHE TO ONE SIDE
AND THEN GO TO THE OTHER SIDE AND STRETCH OUT LIKE THAT
SIDE SWAP IS A NOTATION WHERE EACH NUMBER CORRESPONDS TO HOW LONG THE OBJECT IS IN THE AIR
I'M GOING TO GO SIDE TO SIDE LITTLE HALF CIRCLES I'LL DO CIRCLES WITH ONE LEG AND THEN THE OTHER
OTHER SIDE ACROSS
SO WHEN I GET A CHANCE I WILL JUST DO ONE SIDE AND THEN I'LL COME BACK AFTER THIS SIDE HARDENS AND THEN DO THE OTHER SIDE LATER
IF YOU WERE TO PUT A COAT ON THIS SIDE AT THE SAME TIME THEN THE POINT OF YOUR KNIFE WOULD PRESS IN THERE ON THE EDGE AND IT WOULD MAKE A GROOVE THERE ALONG THE SIDE AND SOMETIMES MESSES UP YOUR A LITTLE BIT
IF I DO ONE SIDE AND I LET IT SET I CAN KNOCK OFF THE BUMPS ON THE OTHER SIDE AND I DON'T GET THAT GROOVE THAT YOU WILL GET IF YOU PUT A COAT ON THIS SIDE RIGHT NOW
YOU WANT TO START WITH YOUR FEET SHOULDER WIDTH HIP WIDTH APART YOU WANT YOUR ELBOWS IN TO THE SIDE WITH A NICE NEUTRAL WRIST CHOOSING A WEIGHT THAT'S GOING TO FATIGUE THAT MUSCLE IN TEN FIFTEEN REPS THREE SETS
AND YOU WANT TO JUST CURL IT UP START BY WORKING UNILATERAL SO YOU CAN GET A FEEL FOR EXERCISING MUSCLE ON EACH SIDE BEFORE YOU GO ADDING IN THE DYNAMICS OF DOING BOTH WEIGHTS BILATERALLY HERE
ON THE FLIP SIDE WHEN YOU THROW A BASEBALL TO ONE OF YOUR TEAM MATES YOU WANT IT TO BE AS STRAIGHT AND TRUE AS POSSIBLE YOU DON'T THE BALL TO STEPPING AND DARTING AND TO DO THAT YOU WANT TO GET THE PROPER FORESEAM GRIP
ALRIGHT THESE THREE GUYS BRING THE BALL DOWN AS SOON AS THEY BRING THE BALL DOWN THE FIRST TWO GUYS OFF THE SIDE LINE COME IN AND ESTABLISH THEIR DEFENSIVE POSITION
SO IF YOU'RE A CONSERVATIVE PLAYER AND YOU WANT TO ERE ON THE SIDE OF BEING SAFE YOU COULD BID FOUR ON THIS AND PRETTY MUCH TAKE THAT TO THE BANK
NOW THE LAST EXERCISE TO STRENGTHEN THE CORE THAT I'LL DEMONSTRATE IS A COMBINATION EXERCISE ALSO AND IT'S A CRUNCH WITH A SIDE BEND
NOW THE CRUNCHES ARE GREAT FOR REALLY STRENGTHENING THE CORE AND SIDE BENDS ARE GREAT FOR FLEXIBILITY AND STRENGTHENING THE CORE AS WELL THE OBLIQUES IN PARTICULAR
SO I'LL DEMONSTRATE NOW THE CRUNCH SIDE BEND COMBO
LIE BACK IN THE CRUNCH POSITION YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP AND THEN COME DOWN BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO COME ALL THE WAY DOWN BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO COME DOWN AND DO A SIDE BEND CRUNCH UP SIDE BEND OTHER SIDE UP SIDE BEND BREATHE AND YOU WILL CONTINUE DOING THAT UNTIL YOU REACH REPS OF ABOUT I'LL SAY TWELVE
AND SO ONE REP IS A CRUNCH SIDE BEND RIGHT CRUNCH SIDE BEND LEFT THAT'S ONE REP
THE REASON WHY THEY'RE ODD IS IF YOU DO IT ON AN EVEN COUNT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUOUSLY BREATHE ON THE SAME SIDE
NEVER EVER EVER BREATHE ON THE SAME SIDE
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SPECIFIC AREAS WHERE YOU CAN USE CHOPPING ON A HORSE AND AGAIN WHEN I SAY CHOPPING I AM TALKING ABOUT HOLDING YOUR HAND LIKE THIS USING THE SIDE OF YOUR HAND OK YOU CAN USE IT RIGHT IN BACK OF RIGHT IN THE WITHERS AREA NOT ALONG THE SPINE IN THE AREA THAT'S RIGHT HERE NEXT TO THE SPINE AND IN BACK OF THE SHOULDER BLADE
TAKE A PIECE OF FRENCH BREAD AND WE ARE GOING TO TURN IT TO THE SIDE AND WE ARE GOING TO CUT IT IN HALF
IF SOMEONE GRABS YOU SAY THE OPPOSITE SIDE I CAN STEP IN KEEPING THIS HAND LOW WHICH IS HOW WE DEMONSTRATE IT BY KEEPING IT LOW TO YOUR CENTER
YOU WANT THESE TO BE ABOUT AN INCH THICK SO THEY'RE NICE AND STURDY FOR THE SIDE WALLS OF YOUR LEAN TO SHELTER
SO I'LL LEAVE A MARGIN OF AN INCH ON EITHER SIDE
ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE DOSING CHAMBER I HAVE A LEVER TO PULL THE COFFEE OUT OF THE DOSING CHAMBER
AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OVER HERE AS WELL I HAVE A SWITCH TO TURN ON THE ESPRESSO GRINDER
YOU WANT TO POSITION YOUR SAWHORSES SO THAT THE MATERIAL YOU ARE CUTTING HANGS OFF A LITTLE BIT ON EACH SIDE
YOU WANT THE CUT END OF YOUR MATERIAL TO DROP OFF OF ONE SIDE SO THAT WHEN YOU RUN THE SAW DOWN HERE IT WILL FALL OFF THE SIDE ON TO THE GROUND
BENDING THAT KNEE DROPPING IT OVER TO THE SIDE OVER TO THE RIGHT OPEN UP THAT HIP PERFECT
SO PLEASE WATCH OUR NEXT SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO COVER REMOVING THE DOOR INSERT FOR DRIVER'S SIDE BOTH FRONT AND REAR
OKAY AFTER YOU REMOVE THAT LATCH THEN WE JUST WANT TO APPLY THE SAME PROCEDURE TO REMOVE THE OTHER TWO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE AND WE'LL HAVE THE RESTRAINT SYSTEM REMOVED AND OUT OF OUR WAY
AND AGAIN THESE ARE THIS IS SLIGHTLY MORE NATURAL WAY TO EMPLOY THE MUSCLES LIKE YOU WOULD REALLY EMPLOY THEM FOR DOING REAL SIDE KICKS IN THE STREET
FOLD OUT THE OTHER SIDE LIKE SO AND CREASE THAT WELL
THEN TAKE THIS SIDE AND FOLD IT OVER LIKE SO AND TAKE THIS AND FOLD IT OVER LIKE SO
ON THE OTHER SIDE WE ARE GOING TO PUT THAT HOLLOW TUBE AND WE ARE GOING TO ROTATE THIS CLOCKWISE THIS TIME
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SIDE WITH THAT CONVEX GLASS IS ON THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR DOOR
ON EVERY TIRE TODAY BUILT NOT ONLY YOU'LL SEE THIS ON THIS STICKER BUT IF THE STICKER'S NOT THERE IT'S MOLDED INTO THE SIDE WALL OF THE TIRE
OTHER SIDE BOOM SQUARE IN
NOW THE SLIP PUNCH YOU CAN PRACTICE THIS ON EITHER SIDE
ANOTHER KICK DRILL THAT I DEVELOPED AT THE SAME TIME THAT I DEVELOPED THE CORNER POCKET KICK DRILL WAS THE SIDE POCKET KICK DRILL
MOST ASTRONOMERS SIT OUT AT NIGHT ALONE THEY SEE INCREDIBLE THINGS AND THEY LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO PULL SOMEBODY TO THE SIDE AND AND GET THEM TO LOOK IN THE EYEPIECE AND SEE THE BEAUTY THAT THEY SEE
AND THAT ALLOWS THE SEATBELT TO MOVE ON THE FEMALE END THE FEMALE LATCH SIDE
THE LOWER THE LOFT THE MORE SIDE SPIN YOU GET
TO BEGIN WITH THE STABILITY ON THE BOSU WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN AND YOU ARE GOING TO BRING THE BLACK SIDE TO THE TOP AND THE BALL PART IS GOING TO BE ON THE BOTTOM AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO PUT MY FEET ON HERE IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT O'KAY AND YOU MIGHT BE A LITTLE NERVOUS BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO BRING BOTH OF YOUR FEET ON TOP OF THE BALL AND IT LOOKS JUST LIKE THAT
YOU SET THAT A SIDE
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A CLEAN CAPE OR TOWEL AND HAVE SOME CLIPPERS OR SCISSORS BY YOUR SIDE
ALRIGHT NOW SHE IS TURNED TO THE SIDE BACK LEG IS EXTENDED
NOW HIS JOB HAS TO BE IN HELP SIDE
SO WHEN YOU'RE OUT HERE GUARDING YOUR MAN AND YOU GO ON HELP SIDE AGAIN YOU NEED TO STAY LOW DROP STEP AND KEEP THOSE GOOD WIDE STANCES UP OR SPRINT TO A PARTICULAR POINT TO TRY TO GET OVER AND STOP THIS GUY
AND SOME KIND OF KEY PLACES TO LOOK IN THE BEDROOM FOR THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ARE THE BED SIDE BED SIDE TABLE WHERE RANDOM THINGS TEND TO COLLECT
RISSA IS GOING TO COME ALONG SIDE HER YEAH AND TAKE HER KNEES EQUAL TO GINA'S KNEES HER HANDS AGAIN ARE ALSO GOING TO BE RIGHT UNDERNEATH HER SHOULDERS
THIS IS THE CAMERA STRAP AND IT ATTACHES SECURELY ON EITHER SIDE AND UNDERNEATH IS YOU SLIDE THIS TO THE RIGHT OPEN THIS UP AND HERE'S WHERE YOUR RECHARGEABLE BATTERY IT'S A PROPRIETARY BATTERY IT'S A LITHIUM ION RECHARGEABLE YOU CAN'T USE DOUBLE A'S IN THIS BATTERY AND HERE'S WHAT YOU PUT THE MEMORY CARD IT USES AN SD MEMORY CARD
WE'RE JUST GOING TO PLACE THAT SIDE ZIPPER ON THE SIDE SEAM
SO TYPICALLY YOU MAY SEE SOMEONE LYING ON THEIR SIDE DOING INSIDE LEG RAISES OR MACHINE TO TRAIN THAT MUSCLE
I HAVE MY SIDE CUTS ALSO REFERRED TO AS DYKES FOR ADJUSTMENT OF THE REAR BRAKES
BUT I'M CHOOSING TO USE THE FLAT SIDE AS THE BOTTOM BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO BE THE INTERIOR OF THE TURTLE
SO I'M GOING TO CUT DOWN THIS FOIL A LITTLE BIT AND WE'RE BASICALLY GOING TO BRING IT ALL INTO THE CENTER SIMILAR TO HOW WE DID THE ORIGINAL INSIDE NEWSPAPER SIDE OF THE SHELL
YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH SIDE OF THE FOIL YOU WANT TO USE BUT I LIKE TO USE THIS SIDE BECAUSE IT HOLDS PAINT A LITTLE BIT BETTER
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON WHEN WE GET STARTED TO BE LEANING TO ONE SIDE
AND THEN WE WANT TO FIND THE SIT BONE SO THAT YOU CAN EQUALIZE THE SIT BONE SO THAT WE'RE NOT LEANING TO ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER
SHIFTING WEIGHT SIDE TO SIDE RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT
WHAT I DO IS I TAKE IT I SPIN IT AROUND TO WHERE MY ARMS ARE CROSSED BUT THEN I LAY IT UP AGAINST MY BODY TO THE SIDE AND THAT'S ACTUALLY A STRIKE IN OF ITSELF BUT THEN YOU CAN TURN THAT INTO A SPIN BY TAKING IT UNCROSSING YOUR ARMS CHANGING YOUR HANDS POSITIONS SO NOW YOUR RIGHT HAND IS PALM DOWN LEFT HAND PALM UP
CROSS IT AROUND AND LAY IT UP AGAINST YOUR BODY AND WHAT YOU DO IS YOU SCOOP DOWN CHANGE YOUR HANDS AND NOW YOU SCOOP DOWN TO THE OTHER SIDE AND IT'S ACTUALLY A CONTINUOUS SPINNING OF THE BO STAFF
AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO A BATMAS TO THE FRONT WHILE LYING ON YOUR SIDE
SO YOU KIND OF LEAVE YOUR FINGER TO THE SIDE LEAVE YOUR FINGERS HERE CAUSE IF YOUR FINGER IS EVER ON THE TRIGGER YOU ALWAYS HAVE THAT POSSIBILITY THAT THE SAFETY MIGHT NOT BE ON OR EVEN IF IT IS ON IT MIGHT NOT BE WORKING RIGHT AND YOU COULD SHOOT SOMEBODY
THEN LET YOUR WEIGHT AND MOMENTUM CARRY YOU BACK OVER AND YOU'LL GO FAKIE DOWN THE OTHER SIDE THAT IS WHERE YOU FAKIES COME INTO PLAY
AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PROCEED TO GO AROUND LIKE THIS HALF THE HEAD FROM THE EAR TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEAD THIS WAY
SO YOU JUST KINDA HAVE TO THINK IN TERMS OF THE LAYERS GOING BACKWARDS VERSUS WHEN YOU PAINT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
ONE RULE TO REMEMBER THOUGH WHEN YOU'RE EVER CLIPPING INTO YOUR RESCUE JACKET IS THAT YOU ALWAYS USE A LOCKING CARABINER NOT ONLY IS IT LOCKING BUT WHEN YOU CLIP IT ON IT'S LOCKED AND YOU CHECK IT'S LOCKED AND THAT WAY IF IT SWINGS OFF TO THE SIDE IT'S NOT GONNA GET UNCLIPPED AND CLIP IN TO SOMETHING THAT WON'T RELEASE ON THE SIDE OF YOUR JACKET
NOW WE'LL DO THE SAME ON THIS SIDE SEAM
THEN RIGHT HERE ON YOUR LEFT HAND SIDE IT SHOWS SCREEN RESOLUTION
FOR A SAND BOA WE'RE LOOKING SOMEWHERE AROUND 110 DEGREES ONE SIDE AND 85 DEGREES ON THE OTHER
OKAY SO NOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS TAKE EACH SIDE AND TUCK IT UNDER USING YOUR THUMB AND YOUR INDEX FINGER SO THAT'S TUCKED UNDER AND THIS EDGE IS TUCKED UNDER
TURN THE UNIT TO THE OTHER SIDE AND FOLD DOWN THOSE TRIANGLES
OPEN IT TO THIS SIDE AND THEN BALANCE OUT THE UNIT BY DOING THE SAME THING ON THE OTHER SIDE SO YOU HAVE FOUR SECTIONS ON EACH SIDE
WE DID IT ON THIS SIDE TURN THE UNIT OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE AND FOLD DOWN THE TRIANGLE
SO YOU'RE HOLDING HERE YOU PUSH OUT OFF TO ONE SIDE AND YOU'RE GOING TO DROP IN THIS WAY
AND YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUSH OUT TO THE SIDE LIKE THIS AND THEN DROP YOUR HAND TO THE INSIDE SO YOU HAVE THIS TWIST MOTION
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN ONE OF THOSE GREAT WHITE SHARKS THAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT CAME AROUND THE SIDE OF A SHIPWRECK AND SPOTTED THE LITTLE BABY FISH AND IT WAS VERY HUNGRY
SO NOW MY HANDS GOING TO BE BY MY SIDE AND AS I I TAKE AN INHALE AND AS I EXHALE I'M GOING TO LIFT
THEN WE HAVE THE DRAWSTRING WHICH IS ONE LONG PIECE BUT WHEN I'M READY TO INSERT IT INTO THE BAG I CUT IT IN HALF AND I RUN ONE PIECE AROUND THIS SIDE TO THE HOLE THEN THIS ONE GOES AROUND THE OTHER SIDE SO THE IDEA IS WHEN I OPEN IT THIS IS THE WAY IT CLOSES IT IT PULLS EACH SIDE AGAINST THE OTHER AND CLOSES IT
ANOTHER GREAT ACUPUNCTURE POINT IS THE SIDE OF THE TEMPLES JUST BEHIND THE BONE HERE AROUND THE ORBIT OF THE EYE
AND WE'LL PUT THAT TO THE SIDE I'M WORKING ON A PIECE OF BAKING PAPER WHICH IS NON STICK BAKING PAPER
GOOD INHALE ALL THE WAY BACK UP AND EXHALE AND THEN ROLL OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE AGAIN PRESSING YOUR HIP RIGHT DOWN AS YOU OPEN YOUR TRUNK OPEN THE SIDE DOOR TO THE HEART THE SIDE RIB CAGE LENGTHENING LONG GOOD INHALE REACHING BACK UP AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT AGAIN JUST REACHING OVER TO THE SIDE FEELING THAT NICE LONG SIDE STRETCH AND ONE MORE TIME OVER INTO THE OTHER DIRECTION GOOD INHALE REACH THE ARMS UP AND AS YOU EXHALE DRAW THE ENERGY INTO THE HEART CENTER
SO IF YOU PUNCH THAT SIDE I CAN BLOCK STILL I CAN BLOCK WITH THE RIGHT CHOP WITH THE LEFT
THIS TECHNIQUE CAN BE PERFORMED ON EITHER SIDE WITH EITHER HAND
DON'T PICK THE ELBOW UP YOU WANT TO KEEP IT DOWN SO THAT WHEN YOU STRIKE YOU CAN MOVE UPWARDS AIMING FOR THE NECK SIDE OF THE JAW
SAME SIDE AND PUNCH THE LEFT HAND
ONE HAS THE GROOVES IN IT AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE IS FLAT
ONE OF THE CHECKS YOU WANT TO DO WITH THIS IS LAY YOUR TOOL AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE BODY AND WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
THE SIDE WALL LOOKED REALLY GOOD
I AM GOING TO USE MY BIG HEAVY SCRAPER AND CUT FROM HERE ABOUT UP TO HERE AND THE SCRAPER DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB ON FLAT GRAIN BUT WHEN IT COMES OVER TO HERE WHERE YOU HAVE GOT END GRAIN AND SIDE GRAIN IT HAS A TENDENCY TO TEAR
YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE WILL STRAIN THEIR NECKS BECAUSE THEY'RE SWIMMING AND YOU BREATHE ON ONE SIDE SWIM BREATHE ON THE SAME SIDE SWIM BREATHE ON THE SAME SIDE
I'VE GOT SOME OTHER REFLECTORS HERE AGAIN SILVER ON ONE SIDE WHITE ON THE OTHER
WHICH IS SHOWING WHAT THAT IS IT'S A FAKE JUST A FAKE TO ONE SIDE SO THEY THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GO THAT WAY BUT THE BALL IS JUST GOING TO KEEP GOING THE SAME WAY AND YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT
TAKE THE LEFT SIDE BRING IT TO THE MIDDLE
NOW TO SAVE THIS STYLE WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS PRESS THE MENU BUTTON ON THE TOP LEFT SIDE OF THE CAMERA AND THAT USER DEFINED NUMBER ONE SETTING YOU CAN SEE HAS BEEN BASED OFF THE PORTRAIT PICTURE STYLE BUT HAS BEEN CUSTOMIZED AND SAVED
ONE WILL GO DOWN INTO THIS SIDE AND THE OTHER ONE WILL GO DOWN THE BACK COVER
NOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IN ORDER TO MAKE IT EASIER TO TUCK INSIDE AT THE EDGE WHERE THE CONTINUATION OF THE BOOK WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A LITTLE SNIP AND THE TAPE WILL HAVE ITS GROOVES OVER HERE AND ALSO ON THE OTHER SIDE
AND YOU CAN HIT IT IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN HIT IT ON THE SIDE THAT PINGY SOUND YOU CAN MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A HORROR MOVIE
JUST KIND OF WORK YOUR THUMBS AROUND THE SIDE OF HER HEAD TO PULL A LITTLE BIT OF HAIR DOWN
AGAIN A LATERAL SIDE FLEXION TARGET THE OBLIQUES
SO AS YOU CAN SEE SHE HAS SOME LAYERS AND IT'S KIND OF SHORT ON THE SIDE AND IT'S KIND OF HIGH IN THE BACK
THIS IS A VICE-GRIP STYLE OF WRENCH THAT ACTUALLY LOCKS ON THE NUT THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON SO YOU CAN USE THE OTHER HAND TO LOOSEN OR TIGHTEN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOLT
WE ARE ON THE DRIVER S SIDE FRONT GOT THE LEFT ONE INDICATED HERE ON THE CASTING OF THE CONTROL ARM AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE AND SET OUR CONTROL ARM UP INTO PLACE
SO I'M GOING TO PUT MY HANDS ON EITHER SIDE OF IT THEY'RE ON MY KNEES
AND THEN FLIP IT BACK ON AND WE'RE NOW READY TO PLAY THE MUSIC ON THE OTHER SIDE BY HITTING THE PLAY BUTTON AND YOU'LL BE OFF AND GOING
I'M GONNA GO TO THE OTHER SIDE I'M GONNA BE SEWING ON THE OTHER SIDE AND I THINK YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT
YOU WANT TO TAKE THE RIGHT SIDE BRING IT TO THE MIDDLE
I'M GOING TO DO IT FOR THE BACK SIDE
COME IN HERE AND GO LIKE THAT AND THEN WE'LL GIVE HIM SORT OF AN UNDERBELLY HERE AND WE'LL KIND OF MAKE HIS BIG BEETLE LEGS COMING OUT THE SIDE
REMEMBER WHAT YOU DO TO ONE SIDE YOU DO TO THE OTHER AND THIS LEATHER STRAP WILL MAKE THIS SERRATED KNIFE WHERE IT WILL SHAVE HAIR JUST LIKE A STRAIGHT EDGE KNIFE
SO KEEP IT VERY LIGHT YOU CAN SEE THIS SIDE IT'S VERY STIFF AND THIS SIDE IS VERY LIGHT IT'S STILL DOES HAVE PRODUCT IN IT
WHEN YOU KEEP YOUR HAND OPEN YOU HAVE MORE SURFACE AREA ON THE BALL WHICH CAN HELP YOU TO GUIDE THE BALL TO WHERE YOU WANT IT TO GO ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE COURT
WE'LL BEGIN OUR FROSTING WITH THE SIDE OF THE CAKE AND THE KEY HERE IS TO USE A LOT OF FROSTING
I'M GOING TO SHOW IT FROM THE SIDE AGAIN
OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THE SAME THING TO THE SIDE THAT WE DID BEFORE
OKAY AND THEN YOU WILL REPEAT THE SAME THING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
ON THE OTHER SIDE WE ARE GOING TO GO DOWN
AND THEN WE WILL COME UP ON THE OTHER SIDE
AND THE GO TO THE OTHER SIDE AND COME UP
AND THEN THE OTHER ONE YOU WOULD TAKE AND YOU WOULD PUT TOWARDS THE BOTTOM ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
TURN YOUR UNIT TO THE OTHER SIDE AND WE ARE GOING TO DO A CRIMP FOLD WITH THE HEAD AS WELL SAME THING WITH THE TAIL
WE HAVE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN WE JUST DID ELEVEN WHICH WAS THE REVERSE YOKOMEN TO THE SIDE OF THE HEAD AND TWELVE
I'M GOING TO TURN HERE CATCH HIM ON THE SIDE OF THE HEAD
SO NOW WE SELECT OUR FILE AND AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE THE SERVICE SIDE AND THE KK COUTURE FORWARDER
YOU CAN ALSO CLEAR IT BY PRESSING THIS CLEAR PEAK SPOT BUTTON ON THE LEFT SIDE
IF YOU USE THE WHITE SIDE THE METAL IS GOING TO LOOK A LITTLE MORE GRAY AND A LITTLE MORE DEFUSED AS WELL
I KIND OF LIKE TO DO ON MY CORNERS ONE SIDE AT A TIME IF I AM USING FORTY MINUTE AND IF I CAN DO IT BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE USE CORNER TROWELS AND I DO SOMETIMES BUT A LOT TIMES I DON'T SIMPLE BECAUSE IT TAKES A LOT OF TIMES FOR ME TO STOP AND GRAB THE CORNER BEAD AND START USING IT AND ALL THAT
NOW TO GO IN TO OUR FLYING BIRD WE'RE GOING TO OPEN THIS SIDE UP AND OPEN THIS SIDE UP TO WHERE THEY'RE BOTH AT THE TOP AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE AND OPEN FOLD THEM LIKE SO
YOU CAN ALTERNATE SIDES OR YOU CAN DO ALL ON ONE SIDE LIKE I'M DOING NOW
BUT IF I HAVE IF I PICKED UP A QUARTERBACK I WANT TO GIVE HIM SOME WEAPONS TO THROW TO AND IT LOOKS LIKE OUR BEST OPTIONS RIGHT NOW ARE STILL ON THE OFFENSIVE SIDE AND THIS GUY RUNS A 4.29
SO WRITE THEM DOWN PUT THEM IN YOUR LITTLE HAIR BOOK AND KEEP THEM BY YOUR SIDE SO YOU CAN ALWAYS GO BACK AND LOOK AT THEM
KIND OF JUST SET THAT TO THE SIDE
QUESTIONS CAN GIVE YOU A BREATHING SPACE AND KEEP THE OTHER SIDE ACTIVE
THEY TALK ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS AND HOW THE OTHER SIDE IS IMPACTING THEM IN THE NEGOTIATION BUT THEY DON'T GIVE AWAY MANY FACTS OR OPINIONS
THEN BRING IT CENTER AND I'M GOING TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE
OTHER SIDE SAME THING KEEPS IT THERE DROP YOUR HEAD AND BEND IT ONE MORE TIME
AND THEN WE JUST MOVE TO THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR AND GET THE INSIDE ONE AND THE OUTSIDE ONE IN THE SAME PROCEDURE
YOU RE ACTUALLY GOING TO POP THE YO-YO OUT OF THE STRING ON THE INSIDE IT'S THE SIDE CLOSEST TO YOUR BODY
AND YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND A LITTLE BIT AND PUSH IT INTO PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE OVER ON THIS SIDE
I'M GONNA ACTUALLY PUT THE GLUE ON FIRST AND WE'RE PUTTING THE RIBBONS ON THE SIDE ON THE FRAME FIRST
NOW REMEMBER AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALL OF YOUR PRODUCTS BY YOUR SIDE
WE GOT ONE MORE FOR THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE
THE OTHER SIDE IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL WITH A FEW MINOR DIFFERENCES
WE JUST CAN'T DO IT CONSTANTLY AND ITS ALL ABOUT PORTION SIDE
AND HERE IT IS FROM THE SIDE
SO SINCE I'M ON MY FOREHAND SIDE THIS IS THE BEST SIDE I HAVE TO HIT A LOB SERVE AND THE BACKHAND IS GENERALLY EACH PLAYER'S WEAKEST SHOT
YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE OF OTHER ELITES WHO ARE HELPING THE ARBITER SO THESE ARE COVENANT FORCES THAT ARE ACTUALLY ON OUR SIDE SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE NOT TO KILL THEM
IT IS DIFFICULT TO TELL WHO IS ON WHAT SIDE HERE BUT THAT GUY IS DEFINITELY AN ENEMY
YOU WANT POP OUT THE BACK SIDE OF IT
THE 180 IS GOING TO CAUSE YOUR FEET TO SNEAK A LITTLE BIT TO THE SIDE
SO WE HAVE OUR PEANUT BUTTER OUR STAR NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD A TABLESPOON OF MILK MY GIANT HEARTS SIDE OF MILK AND STICK OF ROOM TEMPERATURE BUTTER
AND I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND LIFT OF THE HEELS OFF THE FLOOR I'M GOING TO KEEP MY STOMACH HELD IN TIGHT AND I'M GOING TO TWIST FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
EACH SIDE COUNTS FOR HALF SO THIS IS ONE ONE TWO TWO THREE THREE FOUR FOUR
SWITCH OTHER SIDE
SO I'LL TURN TO THE SIDE
THEY MISS THE SHOT THESE TWO GUYS ARE FLYING OUT GOING THE OTHER WAY AND THE FIRST GUY ON THIS SIDE COMES IN TO JOIN THEM
SIMPLY LET IT GO ACROSS THE SIDE OF THE MUG
COMING INTO SIDE GATE POSE WHICH IS A WONDERFUL NICE ADULT OPENER
I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND HAVE YOU EXTEND YOUR RIGHT LEG OUT TO THE SIDE
NOW SHE IS PRESSING THE TOES OUT TO THE SIDE
IT'S A NICE SIDE STRETCH BUT YOU WANT TO BE VERY MINDFUL OF YOUR ALIGNMENT
THIN STRAPS ON THE SIDE
IT IS FOUND BY GOING DOWN INTO THE CREASE OF THE ELBOW RIGHT IN THE SIDE
ON THIS MOTORCYCLE BEING A HONDA SHADOW IT DOES HAVE A DIPSTICK RIGHT HERE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE MOTORCYCLE
NOW WE'LL START AT THE SIDE SEAMS
GO UP AND DOWN LIKE THIS AND YOU CAN GO SIDE TO SIDE OKAY
NOW THE QUARTERBACK WILL TURN AND RUN TO THIS SIDE OF THE FIELD AND TRY TO HELP OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLAY
OUR QUARTERBACK RUNS JUST LIKE HE WOULD IN A NORMAL HAND OFF PLAY EXCEPT ONCE HE HANDS THE BALL OFF HE HAS TO ALSO TURN AND RUN TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FIELD SO HE CAN GO DOWN FIELD AND BECOME A BLOCKER AS WELL
IF YOU NOTICE IT'S VERY LIGHT I'M DOING THE CRUNCH FROM THE SIDE
YOU WILL FIND THAT SOMETIMES THERE'S AN AN AN UNBALANCE AND ONE SIDE WILL BE FRIENDLIER THAN THE OTHER
AS YOU SEE ON THE BACK OF THIS PICTURE AND YOU'LL SEE THIS ON HEAVIER PICTURES OR HEAVIER MIRRORS YOU ACTUALLY SEE THIS WIRE THAT IS STRUNG FROM EACH SIDE
NOW THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO LOOK AT WHEN YOU'RE HANGING YOUR PICTURE IS YOU WANT TO LOOK ON THE BACK SIDE AND SEE WHAT TYPE OF ATTACH POINT IT HAS
AS YOU TURN SIDE TO SIDE YOU KIND OF WANT TO FACE THAT WAY A LITTLE BIT
SO JUST SIDE TO SIDE
KEEP THIS ROPE ON THIS SIDE
NOW I AM GOING TO HAVE THE CROOK OF THE KNEE THE BACK OF THE KNEE COME AGAINST THE SIDE OF HE CHAIR BACK LEG STARTS TO EXTEND
THAT'S GOING TO INDICATE THAT IT'S THE RIGHT OR PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE
SO WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU AT FULL SPEED HERE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE WHEN HE COMES OVER ON HELP SIDE TO STOP THE DRIVE
SO JUST REMEMBER WHICHEVER ARM YOU START TO BEGIN YOUR PULL THAT IS THE SIDE THAT YOU WANT TO BREATHE ON
LAY YOU ACETATE OVER TOP TAKE A PIECE OF PACKING TAPE RUN IT DOWN THE SIDE OVER HERE AND MAKE SURE IT'S NICE AND SMOOTH
NOW THESE SPIKES OR THE LITTLE TINES THAT ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE CACTUS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF AND HAMMERED INTO THE NORMADA HERE SO THAT THEY STICK INTO THE EMPTY CAVITY INSIDE THE RAIN STICK
LEAD SIDE KICK MEANS THAT I'M GOING TO BE USING MY FORWARD LEG TO THROW THE KICK
THE MOVEMENT BEGINS WITH THE LEAD SIDE KICK
THE THREE MOVE COMBINATION THAT WE'RE DOING IS LEAD SIDE KICK REVERSE PUNCH REAR LEG ROUND KICK
ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO POKE HIM IN THE CHIN BUT AT THE LAST SECOND YOU GO RIGHT UP THE SIDE OF HIS RIGHT UP THE SIDE OF HIS JAW RIGHT HERE
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAYBE SOMETIMES TAKE A DRIBBLE TO THE SIDE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR JUST SHOT FAKE AND THEN SHOOT
GET YOUR SHOULDERS IN THE POSITION THAT YOU WANT TO LAND IN AND FRONT SIDE 180 AND ROLL AWAY FAKIE
JUST BEFORE YOU GET TO THE END I'D SUGGEST ABOUT SIX INCHES TO A FOOT BEFORE THE END YOU GET YOUR SHOULDERS ADJUSTED AND THEN FRONT SIDE 180 OUT AND LAND FAKIE AND ROLL AWAY
AND THEN THE KIND OF A HALLMARK OF A BELLY DANCER IS HAVING NICE DARK LINER AND THEN SOMETIMES WE'LL PULL IT OUT AND HAVE A NICE LITTLE LINE OUT THE SIDE OF THE EYE
PARSVOTTANASANA OR PYRAMID POSE IS A REALLY GREAT WAY TO STRETCH YOUR HAMSTRINGS AND ALSO LENGTHEN THROUGH YOUR SIDE BODY'S AND YOUR SPINE
INSTALL THE DISCHARGE HOSE IN THE PORT ON THE SIDE OF THE FILL TUBE BY PRESSING
AND WE HAVE A PIN OR A CLIP THAT WE PUT ON THE SIDE ON THE TANK I'M SORRY ON THE SIDE OF THE FILL TUBE OR THE OVERFLOW TUBE
IT ATTACHES TO THIS PORT ON THE SIDE OF THE FILL VALVE AND GOES INTO THE OVERFLOW TUBE
PUSH WITH YOUR LEGS AGAIN PULL THE BELLY BUTTON IN TIGHTEN UP YOUR ABDOMINALS AND PULL YOUR HANDS INTO YOUR STOMACH ELBOWS CLOSE BY YOUR SIDE SHRUG YOUR SHOULDERS ONTO YOUR BACK
TURN THE UNIT TO THIS SIDE THE FRONT SIDE
THIS IS THE BACK SIDE THIS IS THE FRONT SIDE
AND THAT'S THE LOWER BODY MECHANICS OF APPROACHING A HEEL SIDE FIVE ZERO ON A HANDRAIL
SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET STARTED ON THE LINING AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE FLIP THE JACKET OUT INTO THE WRONG SIDE IS SHOWING AND THIS IS THE LINING AND WE'RE GOING TO MEASURE FROM THE SEAM WHERE IT WAS ATTACHED TO THE JACKET THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH AND DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT THE PRESSING BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE SEAM THAT WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT
I WANT TO MENTION COLORING IT CAN BE MORE PROFESSIONAL KIND OF CAUSE YOU CAN MIX DIFFERENT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT COLORS YOU CAN MAKE IT LIGHTER ON ONE SIDE DARKER ON THE OTHER SIDE WHICH GIVES IT A SHADY KIND OF LOOK
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE SIX BALL IN THE SIDE POCKET
AND A NICE WAY TO CUT THIS IS TO COME DOWN THE BONE LIKE THIS ALL THE WAY DOWN AND OFF TO THE SIDE
FROM COMING UP HERE WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE BALL OUTSIDE THE COURT ON THIS SIDE TO COME IN A LITTLE MORE BACK AND CORRECT THAT MISTAKE YOU'RE MAKING
NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE BACKHAND AND THE SAME KIND OF A LITTLE TROUBLE THAT HAPPENS ON THE FOREHAND BUT WE'RE GOING TO GET A LITTLE MORE DETAILED ON THE BACKHAND SIDE SO YOU CAN SEE IT
AGAIN NORMALLY HAPPENS ON THE BACKHAND SIDE BECAUSE WE ARE MOVING OUR BODY FORWARD AND WHEN WE'RE AIMING THE BALL AS YOU CAN SEE MY FACE OF THE RACQUET IS LOOKING OVER THERE INSTEAD OF LOOKING IN FRONT OF ME AND IT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE MY WRIST IS GIVING UP MY LEFT WRIST IS GIVING UP OR MY BODIES GOING FORWARD
IF YOUR BALL IS GOING TOO MUCH TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE COURT THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE HITTING IT PROBABLY TOO MUCH IN FRONT OF YOU
YOU'RE GOING TO FACE TOWARDS THE RIGHT SIDE
IT'S REALLY MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN YOU'RE USING IT ON THE SIDE OF THE COURT
AND THAT'S A GOOD STRATEGY TO SHOOT TWENTY FIFTY 100 200 SHOTS FROM THIS SIDE USING THE BACKBOARD UNTIL YOU GET USED TO IT
WE DON'T WANT IT TO HAVE ANY EXCESS FORWARD ROLL WE DON'T WANT IT TO HAVE ANY EXCESS BACKSPIN OR SIDE SPIN OR ANYTHING ELSE
THIS ONE HAPPENS TO BE LOCATED ON THE RIGHT SIDE RIGHT DOWN HERE
IF YOUR SIDE HAS BID SIXTY RIGHT AND YOU HAVE THIRTY-FIVE MELD YOU NEED TWENTY-FIVE COUNTERS TO MAKE THAT BID
NONE OF THESE NOBODY LIVES IN THIS LITTLE TOWN ANYMORE AND YOU'LL ACTUALLY JUST GO THROUGH THIS BATHROOM AND WE'RE GOING TO GET UP TO THE OTHER SIDE HERE
OK TAKE YOUR ARMS TO THE SIDE
THAT'S THE FARTHEST UP THE SIDE I DARE COME
IT'S ANOTHER WAY TO GET YOU FROM SIDE TO SIDE THE STEP TOGETHER WILL BASICALLY GET YOU IN CIRCLES OR FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER SIDE
IT'S ACTUALLY JUST STEPPING TO THE SIDE AND BRINGING YOUR FEET TOGETHER
SO IT WOULD BE STEP OUT STEP TOGETHER STEP OUT STEP TOGETHER AND YOU CAN DO THIS FROM WALKING A ROOM SIDE TO SIDE OR IN A LARGE CIRCLE
BUT YOU'LL FILL IN THIS SIDE AND YOU'LL ALSO FILL IN THIS SIDE ENTIRELY WITH THE SKY BLUE ONCE YOU'RE DONE
WITH YOUR WEIGHTS YOUR FREE WEIGHTS HANGING RIGHT DOWN BY YOUR SIDE OR AN OPTION WOULD BE TO PLACE THEM ON THE MIDI PART OF THE SHOULDER RESTING LIGHTLY ON TOP
AND WE WANT TO COME OUT BEHIND THIS ONE AS WELL SO BE CAREFUL TO PLACE THE PORTAL SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU CAN APPROACH THE TURRET FROM THE SIDE OR THE BACK
ON THIS SESSION WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WE'VE GOT A SONG ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE REEL TO REEL ON THIS TWO TRACK REEL TO REEL AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FLIP THINGS OVER SO THAT WE CAN HEAR IT
THE SIDE SEAM AGAIN
AND NOW DO THE SAME THING ON THIS SIDE
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE GINA COME ON TO THE GROUND YES SHE'S GOING TO BRING HER KNEES FORWARD AND SHE IS GOING TO COME INTO A MODIFIED CHILD'S POSE TAKING HER FINGERS IN SO HER ELBOWS CAN BE OUT TO THE SIDE
BUT I RESERVE THIS POLISH IT UP KEEP IT TO THE SIDE FOR WHEN WE GO TO THE SHOWS
HE'LL GUIDE YOU THROUGH ALL THE PITFALLS OF THE CONTRACT TO MAKE SURE HE'S PROTECTING YOUR SIDE
ALRIGHT NOW LET'S LEARN HOW TO DO BATMAS WHILE LYING ON THE SIDE
THIS WILL CONNECT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF YOUR TUBE
BEING A STAMPER I AM I STAMPED THE OTHER SIDE OF MINE
YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO GO ON EITHER SIDE OF IT AND AS YOU RUN YOUR FINGERS UP AND DOWN ON EITHER SIDE YOU'LL FEEL THEM SORT OF SINK INTO THIS VALLEY
GOING BACK AND FORTH JUST GIVING IT A NICE CUT AND THAT'S A NICE ADD ON TO YOUR THING AND JUST AGAIN PUTTING IT RIGHT HERE ON THE SIDE KIDS COULD GRAB WHAT THEY WANT
THE ARMS ARE JUST LOOSE BY THE SIDE TO BEGIN WITH
KNEELING SIDE CRUNCH WITH BALL WITH FITNESS BALL SUPPORT
AND AGAIN IF YOU CHOOSE TO TRY TO DO THESE AND MIX THEM UP FRONT KICK SIDE KICK SORT OF BACK SWING RIGHT HERE YOU CAN DO THAT IF YOU LIKE TO MIX IT UP A LITTLE BIT
YOU ALSO GOT A JUMPING SIDE KICK WHICH IS EASIER TO RUN AND ACTUALLY LEAP INTO SOMETHING
I LIKE TO USE IT ON THIS SIDE AS YOU CAN SEE
THIS SIDE GET A LITTLE SLIPPIER FOR OUR KNIFE
THE EASIEST WAY I FIND TO CUT THESE IS I WOULD USE THIS SIDE
AND THIS SIDE IS THE ONE WITH THE HOLE
THATS ONE SIDE I'M GONNA GO BACK AND DO THE OTHER SIDE
TO SET THE CAMERA TO PORTRAIT MODE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS TAKE THIS MODE DIAL HERE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BACK SIDE OF THE CAMERA AND I'M JUST GOING TO SPIN IT FROM FULLY AUTOMATIC MODE TO PORTRAIT MODE
HI I AM BOBBY LAREW WE ARE HERE POOL SIDE GETTING READY TO DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU THE REVERSE ONE AND A HALF SOMERSAULT IN A TUCK POSITION OR A GAINER ONE AND A HALF REMEMBER I TOLD YOU THEY ARE BOTH THE SAME THING
PUT THE CREASE IN THE CENTER AND THEN TURN IN AND REPEAT OVER TO THE SIDE
SO IT'S JUST A PRETTY SIDE LOCK AND NOW SHE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL
SEE I HAVE A NICE RIB OF FROSTING COMING UP ON THE SIDE PLENTY OF FROSTING
IT'S KIND OF LIKE HOW WE DID THE SIDE WINDER
AND YOU ARE GOING TO EXTEND ONE ARM HERE I'M DOING MY RIGHT ARM AND THE RIBS ARE GOING TO EXPAND AND LIFT THROUGH THE RIGHT SIDE AS IF I HAVE AN APPLE IN A TREE AND I'M REACHING TO PICK IT
SO TURN RIGHT THIS SIDE THANKS
YOUR GOING TO HAVE TWO WINGS ONE FOR EACH SIDE OF THE BUG BODY
USUALLY BRING SOMEONE WITH YOU FOR THE APPOINTMENT JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE
AND I'LL DO THAT FROM THE SIDE SO YOU CAN SEE THAT
SO I'M STARTING WITH THREE WHITES ON THIS SIDE AND THREE REDS ON THIS SIDE AND WHEN I'M DONE WHEN THEY'RE ON THE FLOOR THERE SHOULD BE A PILE OF THREE WHITES OVER HERE AND A PILE OF TWO REDS OVER HERE
SO I AM GOING TO START ON THE LEFT SIDE OF HER LEGS
AND I'LL WORK MY WAY THROUGH THAT AREA UNTIL THAT IS CLEARED AND THEN DO PART ON EACH SIDE OF THE LEG YOU KNOW I'LL CLEAR A SECTION HERE AND I WILL BE GOING TO A SECTION HERE
OBLIQUES DOING SIDE TO SIDE MAYBE WITH A WEIGHT OKAY OTHER CRUNCHES THAT WE CAN DO FOR OUR STOMACH AND FINALLY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT UPPER BODY
VERY GOOD HERE MELISSA FROM HERE EAGLE CLAW REACH YOUR HANDS OUT TO THE SIDE AND NOW SQUEEZING DOWN REMEMBER TO ROLL THE THUMBER UNDERNEATH
TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE THAT HAVE A WIRE BRUSH THAT STICKS IN AND YOU ROTATE TO CLEAN THE FEMALE SIDE
YOU WANT TO COME STRAIGHT UP TO THE SIDE
THUMBS ARE FACING IN ROTATING MY HAND AND COMING STRAIGHT UP TO THE SIDE OKAY
LAST TIME REACHING THE KNEE TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE
IN OUR NEXT SEGMENT I'M GOING TO SHOW HOW TO PUT THE STRING ON THESE PINS AND HOW TO MOVE THEM FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND GIVE YOU SOME OPTIONS ON DIFFERENT WAYS THAT IT COULD BE DONE
THE FOOT POSITIONS FOR THIS STEP LEFT FOOT BACK RIGHT FOOT IN PLACE LEFT FOOT TO THE SIDE CLOSE RIGHT FOOT TO LEFT FOOT LEFT FOOT TO THE SIDE RIGHT FOOT IN PLACE LEFT FOOT CLOSES TO RIGHT FOOT RIGHT FOOT TO THE SIDE
YOU CAN AVOID THAT BY LISTENING TO YOUR GUIDE AND PADDLING IF YOU HIT THE ROCK ANYWAY THE GUIDE SHOUTS OUT “HIGH SIDE' IF YOU CLIMB TOWARD THE HIGH SIDE OF THE ROCK THE HIGH SIDE OF THE RAFT THEN THE WEIGHT WILL COME OFF THE LOW SIDE AND YOU CAN SPIN OFF THAT ROCK CELEBRATE A CLOSE CALL AND CONTINUE ON DOWNSTREAM
IF YOU FIND THAT WHEN YOU'RE DOING A HIP ROLL THAT YOU'RE TAKING SOME TENSION IN YOUR NECK JUST GENTLY ROCK YOUR HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE
I'M GOING TO BRING MY PADDLE TO THE SIDE I'M GOING TUCK FORWARD AND WHEN I'M TUCKED FORWARD MY HEAD IS PROTECTED WITH MY HELMET MY PFD PROTECTS MY BACK
SO THEN THERE'S A BUNCH OF INDICATOR LIGHTS ON THE SIDE TOO IF WE NEED TO LOAD PAPER IF THERE'S A JAM IF THERE'S AN ERROR OR WHATNOT
YOU CAN ADD IT ON THE SIDE
WHEN YOU ARE SWIMMING AGGRESSIVELY IN CURRENTS A LOT OF THE TIME IN A RESCUE SITUATION YOU NEED TO GET AN ACCESS MIDSTREAM OR SIDE OF THE RIVER EDDIES
AFTER CUTTING THE VINYL OFF WE CAN FLIP THE PANEL OVER AND CUT OUT THE CLOTH ON THE BACK SIDE
ONE THE CLOTH SIDE GETTING THE SCISSORS RIGHT NEXT TO THE TAPE WILL HELP PREVENT FRAYING
IF I WAS MAKING CARROTS AS A SIDE DISH I GO FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT IS CALLED NANTSE CARROT THAT IS A LITTLE FRENCH CARROTS THAT IS JUST BEAUTIFUL
BUT ACTUAL BABY CARROTS WITH THE TOPS ON THEM MAKE A REALLY NICE SIDE DISH YOU SAUTE THEM WITH A LITTLE OLIVE OIL BUTTER AND HONEY
YOU CAN SEE FROM SORT OF THE SIDE IT THAT IT TRAILS DOWN MY BACK
SO IF MY TEAM SERVES THE BALL BUT YET THE OTHER TEAM GETS THE BALL AND PUTS IT INTO OUR SIDE OF THE COURT THEY GET THE POINT EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T SERVE THE BALL AND VICE VERSA
THAT WAS STRETCH SIDE TO SIDE
AND EXHALE LIFT BACK THROUGH CENTER TWIST TOWARDS YOUR LEFT SIDE AND REACH UP AND OVER
SO YOU WANT TO GET THAT FLAT BACK THAT NAVEL SCOOPED IN AGAIN REACH UP AND OVER AND RIGHT SIDE
I'M JUST GOING TO TUCK THEM IN ALONG THE SIDE AND THEY'LL GET BURIED IN
WE WERE THROWING IT UP AND IT WAS HITTING THE ONE SIDE OF THE BOX
SO IT IT'S ALMOST LIKE A WAVE EFFECT AND IT'S VERY CONFUSING BECAUSE THE CELLOS AND THE BASSES AND THIS SIDE MIGHT GET ONE YOU KNOW ONE THING AND THEY THINK MY ELBOW IS YOU KNOW THEY'RE FOLLOWING MY ELBOW ALMOST BECAUSE FROM YOU KNOW FROM THAT ANGLE IT LOOKS CONFUSING TO THE ORCHESTRA
THIS IS GOING TO HELP THIS HAS A SIDE LEVEL AS WELL AS A TOP LEVEL A CIRCULAR LEVEL THAT SHOWS YOU DEAD ON CENTER AS FAR AS WHEN YOU ARE DRILLING DOWN INTO SOMETHING
FOR THE REST [SOUNDS LIKE] WILL WELL THROUGH THE WATER BOX AND COME JUST TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE ON THE OTHER SIDE WHERE OUR TIRES ARE STILL A BIT WET BUT WE'RE UP ON DRY PAVEMENT
WHEN I PULL THE SLIDE BACK IT DON'T LOCK BACK SO YOU WANT TO PUSH UP ON THIS SLIDE STOP RIGHT ON THE SIDE SO WHEN I PULL THE SLIDE BACK PUSH UP ON THE SLIDE STOP
I'M GOING TO MOVE OVER AND DO THIS SIDE AS WELL
WHATEVER YOU DO TO ONE SIDE YOU NEED TO DO TO THE OTHER
FRONT FRONT BACK BACK FRONT AND HIT THE CORNERS TOO AND SIDE CORNER SIDE CORNER SIDE CORNER SIDE
AND FRONT PULL THAT BELLY IN AND POP IT OUT AND CORNER AND SIDE AND CORNER AND SIDE AND CORNER AND SIDE CORNER AND SIDE
ONE ARM IN FRONT ONE ARM TO THE SIDE
JUST LIKE THIS RIGHT SIDE OF THE FACE AND THEN DOWN EVEN FURTHER
SO LIFT UP THOSE ARMS AND YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD TORQUE BAM HIT THE SIDE BAM HIT THE SIDE BAM HIT THE SIDE
TAKE THE SIDE WITHOUT THE BUCKLE AROUND YOUR FEET AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE THE SIDE WITHOUT THE BUCKLE CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT THE BUCKLE ON YOUR SKIN IT CAN BECOME UNCOMFORTABLE
SO GO AHEAD AND PRESS YOUR PICTURE STYLE BUTTON AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BACK SIDE OF THE CAMERA
SO ALL YOU'RE GOING TO DO AND I CAN FACE YOU ACTUALLY IS YOU JUST WANT TO START WITH YOUR FEET APART AND I JUST WANT YOU TO ROLL IT DOWN BECAUSE YOU CARRY A LOT OF TENSION IN YOUR BACK AND IN YOUR NECK AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO STRETCH IT OUT AND YOU'RE GOING TO ROCK SIDE TO SIDE IN YOUR LEFT HIP AND IN YOUR RIGHT HIP KEEPING YOUR KNEES STRAIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL THE NICE STRETCH
NOW THIS TOOL THE SCRAPER WORKS VERY WELL ON FLAT GRAIN DOWN IN THIS AREA WHERE THE GRAIN IS ALL THE SAME BUT IF I COME OVER IN TO THE SIDE GRAIN HERE OVER HERE I'VE GOT VERY LONG GRAIN AND HERE I'VE GOT IN GRAIN SHORT GRAIN
ON THIS VEHICLE THERE IS ACTUALLY A BRACE STRUCTURAL BRACE THAT COMES OUT ON EACH SIDE OF THE FRAME AND THAT IS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PLACE OUR JACK STAND RIGHT UNDER THERE
BUT IT ALSO PROVIDES A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTRAST ON ONE SIDE OF THE SUBJECT
THE REASON THAT THEY WOULD BE FIFTEEN INCHES IS BECAUSE WE NEED TO EXTEND AN EXTRA TWO INCHES ON EITHER SIDE TO CONNECT WITH THE CROSSWISE BINDING
HERE'S A SPEAKER OVER HERE ON THE OTHER SIDE
HERE'S A SPEAKER ON ONE SIDE
YOU WANT THEM TO BE A LITTLE BIT ON THE DRY SIDE
IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THE LENS OFF AGAIN WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO IS PRESS THAT LENS LOCK RELEASE OVER HERE ON THE ON THIS SIDE OF THE CAMERA
BUT NOW WE'LL GO AHEAD AND WORK OUT THE FRONT SIDE OF THE LEGS
I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SWITCH TO THE OTHER SIDE
AND THE SAME THING WITH THE OTHER SIDE
SO I'M LIFTING TO THE SIDE
ALICE MONSAERT THIS STABILITY BALL EXERCISE IS GOING TO TARGET THE OBLIQUES WHICH RUN ON THE SIDE OF THE WAIST
I'LL TAKE A KNEELING POSITION AND BEGIN TO PULL THE BALL INTO MY HIP AND PLACE THE HIP ON TOP OF THE BALL THEN LEAN OVER AND I'M JUST PLACED MY HAND AT THE SIDE AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS REDUCE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN MY RIBCAGE AND MY HIP
TO ADVANCE THE EXERCISE I COME UP ON TO BOTH LEGS SO I'VE ADDED THE BALANCE CHALLENGE PLACE THE HAND BY THE EAR AND AGAIN THE MOVEMENT IS INITIATED FROM THE OBLIQUE MUSCLES ON THE SIDE LIFTING UP
GOING TO GO OTHER SIDE
NOW THIS LAMP IS GOING TO GO ON ONE SIDE OF YOUR AQUARIUM JUST LIKE YOU SEE THERE
IT'S SEVEN ON SEVEN YOU SHOOT EVERYBODY AND THEN YOU GOT TO GRAB THEIR FLAG AND PUT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN THERE'S RECREATIONAL PAINTBALL WHICH IS JUST LIKE FAMILIES COMING OUT HERE SHOOTING EACH UP THEY CAN PLAY CAPTURE THE FLAG AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT IT'S MAINLY ELIMINATION
YOU WOULD HAVE TO SHOOT EVERYBODY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TEAM
SO IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S OVER TO ONE SIDE A LITTLE MORE JUST KIND OF START PULLING IT WHILE YOU ARE SEWING AND JUST STRETCH IT A LITTLE BIT
THERE WE GO AND WE PUT IT ON THIS SIDE AND WE'RE READY TO SLICE IT UP
PERHAPS TO ONE SIDE AS WELL BUT IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS GOING TO BE FROM ABOVE UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY DOING AN ODD LOWER LIGHTING EFFECT
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE SOME MORE CLAY FROM THE MIDDLE HERE BECAUSE I REMEMBERED HOW THICK IT WAS AND I'M GOING TO START MOVING IT NOT SO MUCH THROWING REALLY IF MOVING CLAY FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER ALRIGHT
AND WE'RE JUST SIMPLY GOING TO TAKE THE LINES OF ENERGY ALL THE WAY TO THE SIDE
SO ITS AS IF THERE IS A FAST WIND OR SOMETHING DRAWING ALL THE ENERGY INCLUDING THE EYES TO THE SIDE
THE LONGER THAT SHE MAINTAINS THE POSE SHE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEEPEN THAT TWIST AS THE MUSCLES BEGIN TO SETTLE IN AND RELAX AND THEN PRESENT THE POSE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
PARIVRTTA PARSVAKONASANA REVOLVED SIDE ANGLE
SO TECHNICALLY WE COULD KIND OF USE IT LIKE A REGULAR NECK STRAP EXCEPT WE REACH AROUND BACK AND THERE'S TWO LITTLE HOOKS ON THE SIDE
AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT ON OUR SIDE SO WE'LL TAKE A MOMENT TO JUST COME TO YOUR SIDE AND THEN STAY WITH THE BOTTOM LEG
IF YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS REVERSED AND HE'S TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE HAND OFF ON THE WRONG SIDE AND YOU HAVE YOUR ELBOW OUT THERE CHANCES ARE YOU'RE GOING TO HIT WITH YOUR ARM AND YOU'RE GOING TO KNOCK THE BALL LOOSE FROM THE QUARTERBACK
NOW WHAT HE'S GOT ON HIS HANDS NOW IS HE'S GOT POSSIBLY A RUN OR A PLAY THAT'S GOING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD OR COMING UP THE MIDDLE SO HE'S GOING TO IGNORE ME AS THE QUARTERBACK
NOW ON THE FOREHAND SIDE YOU CAN GO LEFT BIG AND RIGHT AND YOU CAN COVER A HUGE AMOUNT OF COURT AND YOU USUALLY DO THAT WHEN YOU ARE UNDER SOME TYPE OF PRESSURE AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE IN THE STRONGEST POSITION SO YOU CAN SEE IF YOU ARE HERE YOU'RE IN KIND OF A RELATIVELY WEAK POSITION AND YOU CAN TURN IT AROUND AND IT WILL BE A GOOD SHOT BUT GETTING TO THE CORNER IN A MORE UPRIGHT POSITION IS BETTER
I USUALLY FIND IT'S GOOD TO KIND OF PICK A SIDE UNLESS AN OBJECT IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN TOTAL DARKNESS SO KIND OF PICK A SIDE THAT YOU WANT THE SHADOW TO GO ALONG LIKE I'M DOING HERE
IF YOU GO TO THE SIDE VIEW OF THE DIAMOND YOU WILL FIND A VERY THIN LINE FROM THE SIDE COMING DOWN TOWARDS THE CULID
NOW WHEN YOU MOVE YOUR SPATULA BACK AND FORTH TO SMOOTH THE ICING ON THE SIDE YOU DO SORT OF A EDGE-TO-EDGE MOVE
SO INSTEAD OF STARTING HERE WHERE YOU ENDED YOU WANT TO START A LITTLE BIT FURTHER UP ON TOP OF FROSTING AND CONTINUE SPREADING ALONG THE SIDE FOLLOWING THE CONTOUR OF OUR BEAR
WE'RE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT COVERING THE SIDE AND THEN AFTER WE'LL GO AROUND AND SMOOTH IT OUT
ALWAYS STARTING A LITTLE BIT BACK WE'VE ALREADY FROSTED USING A LOT OF FROSTING AND WORK YOUR WAY AROUND THE CAKE'S SIDE SPREADING THAT FROSTING DOWN
IF THE BALL COMES TO YOU AND YOU GOT A PERSON YOU ARE TRYING TO GO AROUND THEIR DEFENDER REMEMBER GO TO THE SIDE COME AROUND THEM OR YOU JUST CUT BACK WHATEVER
THIS HAND GOES PALM UP SLIGHTLY FORWARD PRESSURE AND I'M USING MY FOREARM AGAINST HER SIDE TO HAVE HER DOWN
THEN I'M GOING TO LAY OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ADHESIVE THERE AND I'M GOING TO GO ON TO MY NEXT PIECE THAT I CONSIDERED AN UNDER LAYER LAY IT OUT ON TO THE PLEXIGLAS ROLL IT OVER TO ONE SIDE ROLL IT OVER TO THE OTHER AND AGAIN LAY IT OUT ON TO THE SURFACE OF MY COLLAGING MATERIAL
THAT IS YOUR SIDE PLANK ON THE FOREARM
YOU CAN ALWAYS HOLD THESE SIDE PLANKS ON THE FOREARM FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS TO A MINUTE
THE MOVE WILL GO SIDE TO SIDE UP AND DOWN WITH VARYING TECHNIQUES
WE'RE GOING TO DO THE SAME THING WITH THE OTHER SIDE
AND THEN I'M COMING INTO THE OTHER SIDE TUCK YOUR TOES GRAB THE HEELS STANDING UP WIGGLE HER AROUND A BIT MAKE SURE SHE'S STILL LOOSE SO YOU CAN KICK THE BACK OF THAT KNEE MAKE IT BEND FOOT OVER THE SHOULDER GRAB A HOLD OF THAT KNEE AND WIND IT TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE
NOW IF WE DO THIS FROM LATERAL SIDE AND IF YOU'RE FEELING GOOD AND WARMED AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR BALANCE YOU CAN ADD IN THE ARMS
LET'S JUST TRY CHAIR POSE WITHOUT ARMS JUST LET THEM RELAX BY YOUR SIDE
YOU WANT IT TO BE A NICE EVEN RING ALL AROUND THE PICTURE AND THEN WE'RE JUST GOING TO ONE BY ONE PLACE OUR BEADS ON THEIR SIDE ALL THE WAY AROUND THE PICTURE
LAY IT UP AGAINST THE SIDE AROUND THE CORNER AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT THAT'S PRETTY GOOD
JUST GET ON TOP OF THE BOARD IN THE FRONT SIDE FIFTY FIFTY POSITION
FROM HERE KOTEGAEISHI LIKE I TALKED BEFORE IS NOT A WRIST LOCK OUT TO THE SIDE LIKE THIS
THAT MEANS I'M GOING TO HAVE TO OPEN UP MY RIGHT LEG SO THAT IT'S NOT AGAINST HIS SIDE SAYING UHN-UH
SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THAT LIFT HIS LEFT SIDE USE THAT LEFT FOOT AND WE'RE GOING TO BE PUSHING HIM TO THE SIDE WHILE HE WALKS FORWARD
THAT MAKES IT SO THE BALL JOINT ON THE UPPER SIDE WILL BOLT IN THROUGH YOUR CONTROL ARM BUSHING HOLES
NOW I NEED TO FIND THE HALFWAY POINT HOLD ONE STILL AND TWIST THE OTHER BUBBLE ON THE OTHER SIDE
YEAH THIS IS ONE SIDE THAT YOU CAN USE
IF NOT DO THE SAME THING YEAH AND DO IT MORE SIDE BE CAREFUL
SWITCHING THAT TO THE OTHER SIDE IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO HOLD THESE STRETCHES FIFTEEN SECONDS OR MORE
WE DON'T WANT TO BE UP HERE WHERE YOUR LOWER BACK IS ON THE BALL AS YOU ARE PUSHING UP BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO BE PUTTING A LOT OF RESTRAINT IN YOUR NECK SO AS YOU ARE SETTING UP KEEP YOUR FREE WEIGHTS DOWN BY YOUR SIDE AND YOU ARE GOING TO COME FROM A SEATED POSITION TO ROLL YOURSELF ALL THE WAY DOWN UNTIL YOU FEEL YOUR HEAD AND YOUR SHOULDERS TOUCH THE BALL
BECAUSE SINCE YOU'RE A RIGHTY YOUR RIGHT HAND RIGHT ARM AND RIGHT SIDE IS GOING TO DO SO MUCH
YOUR LEFT SIDE YOUR WEAKER SIDE AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WEAKER IF YOU'RE A RIGHT HANDER TRY THROWING A BALL LEFTY SEE HOW FAR IT GOES
IT'S GOING TO DO SO MUCH YOUR RIGHT SIDE
SO NOW WE FOLDED OUR QUEEN SHEET IN QUARTERS NEXT WE ARE GOING TO FOLD IT IN HALF AGAIN ON THE SIDE EDGE
A THIRD THING YOU CAN DO IS YOU DO BALL TOUCHES IS STANDING ON ONE SIDE OF THE BALL
THIS PICK HERE IS MY FAVORITE AND IT IS BECAUSE IT FOLDS UP IN THE SIDE OF MY POCKET
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SHRIMP AND SCALLOP FETTUCINI WITH A SIDE OF GARLIC BREAD
SHE DID NOT TURN HER BODY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
PULL IT ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE SIDE AND FIRST WE'RE GOING TO WIGGLE IT LOOSE
AND THERE IS YOUR STOCK EXHAUST AND GO AHEAD AND SET THAT TO THE SIDE
SO IF DANIEL TSUKIS ON THIS SIDE I WANT TO ENTER SEE IF I CAN GET IN AS DEEP AS I CAN KEEP THIS OVER THE TOP RAISE UP STRETCH THE ARMS
WITH THIS CUMBIA STEP THIS SIDE STEP WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS STEP NOW AND ADD SOME VARIATIONS TO IT
WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO IS SIT BACK IN A SIDE SQUAT POSITION AND PUSH YOUR BALANCE AND YOUR MEDICINE BALL FORWARD
NEXT CLIP IS GOING TO BE SIDE SQUATS WITH THE BALANCE TRAINER
OUR INHALE IS GOING TO LIFT THE SPINE LIFT BOTH ARMS AND THEN THE EXHALE WILL REACH OVER TO THAT SIDE
SO IF WE CAN COME BACK UP FEEL THE SUPPORT FROM THE FEET AND THEN WE'LL INHALE TO EXTEND THE SIDE LEG EITHER LEG IT'S NOT GOING TO MATTER BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON BOTH SIDES
I MOST LIKELY AM GOING TO USE Y SIDE ARM SERVE ON THIS ONE AND I JUST HIT IT AND THAT WASN'T AS GOOD AS I WOULD LIKE ALMOST PERFECT THERE WE GO
SO BY HITTING THE BALL UP HERE MY OPPONENT IS FORCED TO TAKE THE BALL HIGH WITH HIS BACK HAND OR HE HAS TO TAKE THE RISK OF LETTING IT COME OFF THE BACK WALL OR DYING BACK HERE SO THIS IS A VERY VERY EFFECTIVE SHOT SO ONCE YOU HAVE MASTERED THE TECHNICAL SKILLS OF JUST HITTING THE BALL IN A DECENT MANNER YOU WANT TO START INCORPORATING HITTING IT TO SPOTS ON THE SIDE OF THE WALL TO MAKE YOUR SERVE THAT MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE
REACH LONG AS YOU COME UP AND EXHALE ON THE LEFT SIDE
AGAIN AND LEFT SIDE
AND WHAT THIS HELPS DO IS STRETCH OUT THE OBLIQUES THE STOMACH THE SHOULDERS AND THE ARMS ON ONE SIDE
AND THEN I GO BACK TO THE CENTER AND THEN GO TO THE OTHER SIDE
AND IF WE ACTUALLY DO IT TO THE SIDE LIKE THIS YOU'LL SEE IT WILL ACTUALLY CONFORM TO HOWEVER WE PULL IT
WE WOULD DO THE SAME WITH THE OTHER SIDE
EACH SIDE OF THE DICE HAS A PARTICULAR NUMBER ON IT TOO A CORRESPONDING NUMBER
NOW I'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW EACH ONE EACH SIDE HAS A PARTICULAR PART OF A TRAIN ON IT
THIS IMPACT BAG IS REALLY GOING TO TEACH YOU THE HABIT OF COMING TO THE CORRECT IMPACT POSITION AND IF YOU NOTICE HERE MY WEIGHT IS WAILING TO MY LEFT SIDE THE CLUB FACE IS BEHIND MY HANDS SO MY HANDS ARE HEAD AND IN THIS POSITION I AM ABLE TO HIT DOWN ON THE BALL
KEEP ON THE WAY YOUR HANDS ON THE FLOOR BRING YOUR BODY TO THE RIGHT SIDE BREATH AND RELAX DROP YOUR HEAD
SO YOU WOULD BASICALLY JUST CUT YOUR HOLE RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF YOU ABSOLUTELY AND HAVE YOUR BUCKET OF BAIT OFF TO ONE SIDE AND JIG RIGHT OVER THE HOLE AND ALL THE TIME THE WIND IS AT YOUR BACK
GOOD NOW ONE MORE DOING THIS SIDE CHAMBER SIDE STEP YES NOW CIRCLE BLOCK PUNCH
THIS IS A DODGING PALM PUNCH CHAMBER STAY THERE CHAMBER THIS NOW OPEN THIS HAND MELISSA TURN OVER NOW HERE STEP TO THE SIDE PALM BLOCK NOW STEP TOGETHER AND PUNCH
MY RIGHT FOOT AND RIGHT HAND GO TOGETHER CAT STANCE PUNCH CHAMBER THE HEAD SIDE STEP DODGE CAT STANCE PUNCH
IF WE'RE MOVING TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT WE SHOULD ALSO TRY TO KEEP THAT SHOULDER ABOVE THE KNEE AT ALL TIMES SO THAT WE'RE NOT LEANING TOO FAR OFF TO ONE SIDE
ONCE YOU START LEANING TOO FAR FORWARD TOO FAR BACK OR TOO FAR TO ONE SIDE YOU'RE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO GETTING KNOCKED OVER WHEN YOU DO GET PUNCHED
SO ON THIS ONE IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE COMING FROM THIS SIDE AND WE CAN CREATE THAT AND YOU THINK OH THE TREE TRUNK IS ALWAYS DARK BUT THAT IS NOT ALWAYS TRUE THERE IS HIGHLIGHTS TO THAT TOO
HOW TO DRAW A TREE O'KAY YOU THINK THEN YOU COME DOWN FROM THERE AND YOU HAVE THE TREE PART OF IT COMING DOWN HERE ON ONE SIDE AND THE LIGHT IS COMING FROM THIS SIDE
NOW IT CAN TURN TO THE SIDE IT CAN TURN OUT SLIGHTLY BUT PRIMARILY YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE ON A CENTER LINE
THE WAY THIS IS DESIGNED AND I'LL SHOW YOU ON MY NEW BALL JOINT HERE IN A SECOND IS IT IS A CONCAVE HERE ON THIS SIDE AND A CONVEX ON THIS SIDE
BUT YOU WANT TO TURN THE NUT SIDE AND LOOSEN THE NUT SIDE
SO WHEN I WIND UP FOR THE BEGINNING OF MY SWEEP I HAVE A LOT OF POWER PULLING THE BOAT INTO THE SIDE AND AS I UNWIND MY TORSO COMES BACK TO NEUTRAL AND I LOSE THAT POWER
FOR BIKES THAT DON'T HAVE QUICK RELEASE LIKE THIS IT BASICALLY LOOKS LIKE THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS DUAL LEVER IT IS JUST A BOLT THE BOLT IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND NOT THE LEFT SIDE LIKE THIS ONE CAUSE THERE IS A LEVER ON THE OTHER SIDE
YOU'RE GOING TO PLACE THE PLATED SIDE WE'LL HEAR IT IT'S IN BLACK
THE OTHER SIDE IS SILVER
YOU'LL PUT THE SILVER SIDE INSIDE AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUSH DOWN
WE WANT TO KEEP ALL THOSE DETAIL FEATURES BUT WE HAVE TO LOOSE THE STUFF AROUND THE SIDE
WE WOULD TAKE THE REINS OVER HER HEAD AND WE ARE GOING TO COME AROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE AND RUN THE RIGHT STIRRUP UP
HAVE THE LINING PULLED OUT ON ONE SIDE AND THE FABRIC IS A LITTLE AWAY FROM THE ZIPPER SO JUST MOVE IT OVER RIGHT TO THE EDGE
I'M JUST GONNA WIPE IT OUT WHICH MEANS BRING IT ALL THE RIGHT SIDE OUT
LASTLY YOU NEVER WANT TO CUT WHEN THERE IS A HARD SURFACE BEHIND YOUR WORK PIECE BECAUSE YOU NEED THAT ROOM FOR THE BIT WHEN IT PROTRUDES THROUGH THE BACK SIDE OF IT
THEN ON AN INHALE SHE'S GOING TO REACH BOTH KNEES BACK UP AND THEN EXHALE SHE'S GOING TO REACH THE KNEES OUT TO HER OTHER SIDE
AND THEN A LOT OF THESE HAVE THE TEXTURE THING ON ONE SIDE AND NOT ON THE OTHER SIDE
AND AS YOU CAN SEE THIS SIDE COMPARED TO THIS SIDE THIS SIDE LOOKS A LOT FULLER
WHEN YOU CLICK ON THAT YOU SEE THAT THE GOOGLE NOW IS ONLY LOOKING AT THE INDEX OF BOOKS THAT IT HAS THAT YOU CAN SEARCH THROUGH AND YOU SEE THAT THERE'S MANY ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF BOOKS THAT YOU CAN LOOK THROUGH THAT YOU CAN DO YOUR SEARCH
THE BALL WILL BE LAYING ON THE GROUND AND MAY BE TURNED TO THE SIDE
WE'RE HERE EYES REVERSE YOKOMEN TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEAD
AND WE'LL DO THE SAME THING TO THE OTHER SIDE
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF YOUR AQUARIUM YOU'RE GOING TO USE A HEAT PAD
YOU WILL GET RADIANT HEAT OUT OF IT BUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO IS CREATE A HOT SPOT FOR YOU OK IN THE SIDE OF YOUR AQUARIUM
OK NOW SOMETIMES WHAT HAPPENS IS YOUR GOING TO GET AN ALGAE BUILD UP ON THE SIDE OF YOUR TANKS
THE FORWARD ACTUALLY SMALL FORWARD WILL HAVE THIS RESPONSIBILITY OUT HERE ANYTHING BEYOND THAT POINT GUARDS REACH IS ON THIS SIDE OF THE COURT WILL BE THAT SMALL FORWARDS RESPONSIBILITY
ON THE OTHER SIDE SAME THING WITH THE SHOOTING GUARD ANYTHING OVER THERE PAST THE POINT GUARD WILL BE THAT SHOOTING GUARDS RESPONSIBILITY
SO YOU'LL HAVE THE POINT GUARD UP TOP YOU'LL HAVE A FORWARD RIGHT HERE A CENTER WILL BE A LITTLE FURTHER BACK BUT WHAT YOU'LL HAVE IS YOU'LL HAVE A SMALL FORWARD HERE YOU'LL HAVE THE SHOOTING GUARD ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SUPPORT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEFENSE
SO YOU'LL HAVE A SMALL FORWARD POWER FORWARD ALONG THE MIDDLE AND YOU'LL HAVE THE SHOOTING GUARD ON THE OTHER SIDE
NOW THIS EXERCISE IS PART OF A SERIES THAT WE DO ALL ON OUR SIDE
SO THE REASON WHY WE'RE PUTTING THE STICKS IN WITH THE WOODEN SIDE IN FIRST IS ONE BECAUSE THE TIPS OF THE MATCHES GIVE A DECORATION TO THE STICK AND THE OTHER REASON IS BECAUSE THE TIP OF THE MATCH ALSO HELPS THE STICK FROM NOT GOING THROUGH ALL THE WAY TO THE END
THEN I'M GOING TO TAKE A FOUR WAY OR THREE WAY BUFFER AND I'M GOING TO START WITH THE GRAY SIDE
GO THEN TO THE GREEN SIDE
I'M GOING TO USE A FOUR WAY FILE IT'S GOT DIFFERENT GRITS ON EACH SIDE
FROM HERE YOU'RE GOING TO REACH OUT TO THE SIDE YOU'RE GOING TO BRING YOUR HANDS STRAIGHT TO YOUR SIDE AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO FORM THE EAGLE CLAW
HOLDING THEM STEADY FIFTEEN SECONDS EACH SIDE
THE ELBOWS GO OUT TO THE SIDE AND YOU EXHALE AS YOU LIFT UP INHALE AS YOU GO DOWN EXHALE AS YOU LIFT UP
SOMETIMES IT LOOKS GREAT JUST TO HAVE IT KIND OF IF YOU SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A FASHION LOOK TO ALMOST HAVE IT PRETTY MUCH STRAIGHT IN YOU KNOW THEN YOU'RE JUST KIND OF PEEKING AROUND THE SIDE TO GET THE SHOT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
BUT IN THE CASE OF MY SMALL PIECE I HAVE HERE I HAVE ONE SIDE THAT IS THIRTEEN INCHES AND ONE SIDE THAT IS 25 INCHES
NOW THE WIDTH OF THE QUILT AND THE LENGTH OF THE QUILT IF THEY ARE THE SAME IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH SIDE THAT YOU PICK
NOW THE DOOR WILL STOP ON THIS LITTLE STOP RIGHT HERE AND IT IS GOING TO STOP ON THIS SIDE
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS PROBABLY PUT A COUPLE SILVER BEADS ON EACH SIDE OF IT SO THAT IT CAN DANGLE NICE AND IT WON'T BE STUCK IN BETWEEN THE BEADS AND IT WILL HANG JUST RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF YOUR NECKLACE
ONE I CAN THROW THE SIDE KICK TO THE BODY
THIS IS CALLED LEAD SIDE KICK REVERSE PUNCH REAR LEG ROUND KICK KICK BOXING
EXHALE AND FOLD AND FROM INHALE STEP FORWARD AND FROM UTTANASANA YOU CAN TAKE THE SECOND SIDE
NOW YOU MIGHT NEED TO HOLD ON TO THE GLASS PORTION OF THE OTHER SIDE OF IT SO THAT IT DOESN'T SPIN
NOW TAKING THE RIGHT HAND ON TO THAT THIGH INHALE LIFTING UP THE LEFT ARM INHALE UP AND EXHALE WITH A SIDE STRETCH TO THE RIGHT OPENING UP THAT SIDE AND EXPANDING THOSE RIBS CHEST SHOULDERS AND HIPS STILL FACING FORWARD
THEN VERY SLOWLY AND GENTLY INHALE UP AND WE'RE GOING TO LET YOU DO THE OTHER SIDE SO YOU CAN STAY BALANCED
THAT TAKES ALL OF THE REDNESS AWAY GOT TOO MUCH ON THAT SIDE THERE WE GO PERFECT AND NOW MYRA'S EYEBROWS ARE WAXED AND SHE IS READY TO FACE THE WORLD THAT'S NICE AND CLEAN AND NOW YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR NEWLY FRESHLY CLEANED WAXED EYEBROWS
THE FOUR BALL SIDE BY SIDE MULTIPLEX START
ONCE AGAIN YOU'RE GOING TO ADD A CRIMP TUBE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRACELET CUTTING OFF THE EXCESS CHAIN
THE OTHER SIDE SAYS NO
'AIR SQUATS FROM THE SIDE WILL LOOK LIKE THIS
BUT YOU GET DOWN AND YOU CAN EITHER PUSH IT UP OR YOU JUST GO ALL THE WAY ON EITHER SIDE AND YOU GET A LOB TOO SO IT'S A VERY EFFECTIVE SHOT FOR TURNING THE TABLES ON YOUR OPPONENT
ONE VERY IMPORTANT DRILL THAT BEGINNER SWIMMERS CAN USE IS SIMPLY IN THEIR OWN BATH TUB OR IN A JACUZZI OR A SWIMMING POOL AND THAT'S SIMPLY PUTTING YOUR FACE IN THE WATER BLOWING YOUR BUBBLES OUT NICE AND SLOW AND TURNING YOUR FACE TO THE SIDE
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO TO FIX THAT IS YOU WANT TO SET UP IN YOUR HEEL FLIP POSITION HIT THE TAIL AND THEN REPLACE THE WEIGHT ON THE FRONT SIDE OF IT SO THAT YOUR WEIGHT IS BALANCED EVENLY AND IT ENDS UP FLIPPING STRAIGHT AND YOU'RE ABLE TO ROLL AWAY
NOW YOU CAN'T SEE ALL OF THE STUFFING SO I'VE GOT A LITTLE MORE STUFFING ON THE SIDE HERE
AND YOUR HANDS SHOULD BE BY YOUR SIDE
NEXT WHAT WERE GONNA DO IS DO A LITTLE TOP SEWING ON THE TOP OF THE COIN PURSE SO THIS IS WHAT WAS DONE BEFORE I DONE MADE LITTLE OPENING SEWN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LINING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ZIPPER
OKAY LET'S GO AHEAD AND TRY THE OTHER SIDE
ACTUALLY IT'S REAL SIMPLE I'VE JUST MADE A SQUARE ON THE SIDE OF THE FABRIC OUT OF THE FABRIC AND WE'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THAT IN A NEXT
SLAPPERS IF YOU'RE YOU KNOW ON THE LEFT SIDE OR OR IF YOU'RE TRYING TO REACH THAT OUTSIDE PITCH YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO USE THIS A LONGER BAT A THIRTY-THREE INCH OR EVEN A THIRTY-FOUR INCH
ALRIGHT NOW THAT WE ADDED ONE SIDE OF THE CORNER
I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND ADD THE SECOND SIDE
AND THEN WITH THE BUTTONHOLE PORTION I'VE GOT TWO YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TWO BUTTON FLY THINGS AND I'M GOING TO JUST TRIM THESE UP SO THAT I HAVE THE BUTTON HOLES ON EITHER SIDE
LEAVING OUT THE PAINT FROM THIS PROJECT IS KIND OF A DOWN SIDE FOR KIDS WHO REALLY ENJOY PAINTING
HOLD THAT GRASP THE CORNER AND THE END AND PULL THAT NICE AND STRAIGHT NOW THIS HAS A VERY STRETCHY RUFFLE SIDE YOU CAN JUST FOLD THAT DOWN LIKE THAT AND THEN AGAIN WE WANT TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THE TOP HERE AND JUST PULL IT AS STRAIGHT AS POSSIBLE
YOU CAN STRETCH OUT YOUR LOWER BACK BY TWISTING TO THE SIDE OR TUCKING YOUR KNEES UP TO YOUR CHEST
NOW ITS VERY DIFFICULT TO TELL BUT THEY ARE A LITTLE FLAT ON ONE SIDE YOU WILL SEE THAT THEY ARE FLAT ON ONE SIDE INSIDE OF HERE
