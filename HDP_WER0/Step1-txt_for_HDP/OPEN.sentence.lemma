THEY STOW NICE AND EASILY AND YOU JUST POP THEM OPEN
RELAX THE JAW JUST SWALLOW A FEW TIMES AND LET THE JAW HANG OPEN
AND WITH YOUR FIRST FINGER YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN REALLY LEAVE THOSE OPEN AND THAT'S REALLY GOING TO COME FROM USING THE TIPS OF OUR FINGERS PLAYING RIGHT ON THE VERY OUR FINGERTIPS WHEN WE PLAY THAT
THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DO IS OPEN YOUR HOOD AND LOCATE THE BRAKE MASTER CYLINDER
SO YOU HAVE THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BY OCTAVE IS YOU START OPEN E AND THEN OF COURSE THIS WOULD MAKE E THE FOURTEENTH FRET FOR YOUR THIRD AND FOURTH FINGERS ON THE A AND D STRINGS
SO WHAT YOU'RE USING THERE IS A HARMONIZED CHORD PLAYED OVER A SIMPLE DRUM BEAT WITH THE OPEN STRING AND HAVING IT CREATE A NICE LITTLE PRETTY EITHER LICK OR COULD BE PRETTY MUCH USED WITHIN ANYTHING WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A SONG
SEVEN AND SEVEN ON THE G AND THE E AND SLIDING UP TO THE NINE BACK TO SEVEN AND BACK TO THE SIXTH AND THE FIFTH FRET AND THE WHOLE TIME AND JUST BASED TO THE FINGER STYLE PATTERN WILL BE JUST A PINCH AND THEN USING MY MIDDLE FINGER FOR THE OPEN B THE ENTIRE TIME OK
YOU ALMOST NEVER UNLESS SOMEONE IS SHOCKED AND REALLY HAS THEIR EYES WIDE OPEN YOU ALMOST NEVER SEE THE ENTIRETY OF THE IRIS

SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN A RUNNING BACK COMES THROUGH HE WANTS TO BE LOW HE WANTS TO BE OPEN AND READY WITH HIS INSIDE HAND TO THE QUARTERBACK
HIS INSIDE ARM HAS TO BE OPEN NOT DOWN
IT HAS TO BE OPEN SO THE QUARTERBACK CAN SLIDE THE BALL IN
IF YOU DO FIND THAT THERE'S A BUBBLE IN THE CONTACT SHEET YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE A PIN OR YOUR OAL JUST MAKE A LITTLE NICK IN THERE AND IT'S GOING TO OPEN IT UP SO THE AIR CAN BE PUSHED OUT

SO THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS OPEN THE LEGS UP AND MAKE SURE SHE RELAXES
YOUR HANDS YOU DON'T WANT OPEN HANDS

THEN I'M GOING TO OPEN UP MY RIGHT REIN AND SO HE HAS A PLACE TO GO HE'S ALREADY WANTING TO DO IT AND I'M GOING TO SQUEEZE WITH MY LEFT LEG
YOU CAN ALSO OPEN THIS UP INTO A FLY AND DO YOUR FLY WORK FOR WORKING ALL THOSE MUSCLES ACROSS YOUR CHEST KEEP THOSE ABS ENGAGED AND YOU'LL BE READY TO GO
OK THE SIXTY DEGREE WEDGE IS REALLY LOFTED AND ONE THING I FORGOT TO MENTION IN PREVIOUS SEGMENTS MAYBE IS THAT IF YOU OPEN THE FACE OF YOUR CLUB IT DOES INCREASE THE LOFT WHICH MEANS IT PUTS THE BALL HIGHER
AND THE LAST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS GRAB SOME BREW OPEN IT UP AND TOP IT OFF
NOW WHEN YOU OPEN THAT UP THE FIRST THING THAT POPS UP IS THE VOLUME
AND ON EVERY LOOP ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS PRESS THE A BUTTON WITH YOUR CAPS LOCK OFF AND YOU'RE ABLE TO OPEN UP A WHOLE AUTOMATION SCREEN SET THAT LETS YOU CHANGE THE VOLUME AND WRITE DIFFERENT CHANGES WITHIN YOUR SONG THAT WILL AUTOMATICALLY WORK AS A SONG PLAYS
SO YOU WANT TO GO RIGHT INTO THAT CREASE AND MAKE SURE IT'S REALLY BLENDED AND THAT'S GOING TO REALLY HELP SHAPE YOUR EYES AND MAKE THEM LOOK OPEN
THERE MIGHT BE HOLES THAT YOU CAN PULL STRAIGHT DOWN ON BUT THERE MAY NOT BE AND IF YOU ARE NOT OPEN TO THE IDEA OF USING HOLES THAT DON'T LOOK LIKE LADDER LINES YOU WOULD MISS OUT ON A LOT
OPEN CHORDS BASICALLY TALKS ABOUT FIRST POSITION CHORDS WHICH IS WITHIN THE FIRST THREE FRETS AND THEY ARE CALLED OPEN CHORDS BECAUSE YOU ARE UTILIZING OPEN STRINGS ON ALL OF THESE CHORDS
SO YOU ARE NOT FRETTING THEM LIKE [STRUM GUITAR] YOU ARE PLAYING THEM OPEN WHICH MEANS SIMPLY THAT THEY ARE NOT FRETTED
NOW WE SAID THAT WE HAD AN OPEN D STRING
IF YOU'VE EVER NOTICED WHEN YOU PULL ON YOUR HORSE AND THEY GO TO OPEN THEIR MOUTH YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY KIND OF CONTROL OUT OF THAT
IF I PLAY THE FIRST STRING ON THE FIFTH FRET ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE IT SHOULD SOUND THE SAME AS THE NEXT STRING OPEN
THIS IS A DODGING PALM PUNCH CHAMBER STAY THERE CHAMBER THIS NOW OPEN THIS HAND MELISSA TURN OVER NOW HERE STEP TO THE SIDE PALM BLOCK NOW STEP TOGETHER AND PUNCH
SO IT'S ADJUSTING THE DISTANCE OR THE LENGTH OF THE STRING WITH SADDLE ADJUSTMENTS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PITCH OF THOSE THREE THINGS OPEN STRING OCTAVE HARMONIC AND PLAYED NOTE ARE ALL EXACTLY THE SAME
MOST IMPORTANT AFTER THE CLASS DO OPEN MICS IMMEDIATELY
SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A SAFETY PIN OPEN IT UP AND BEND IT BACKWARDS
THAT WAY YOU HAVE SOME CLEARANCE TO SPREAD THE LEAD OPEN TO GET THE TERMINAL OFF THE BATTERY
WHAT I'M GOING TO BE DOING IS I WILL OPEN UP THE SAW ITSELF THE BLADE ITSELF AND REMOVE IT FROM ONE END THE BASE END AND THAT WILL BE FED INTO A HOLE AND THEN I WILL PLACE IT BACK INTO THE HOLDER AGAIN THE SAW BLADE AND THEN TIGHTEN IT UP
AND IF YOU GO TO AN OPEN TOILET I MEAN OPEN RESTROOM YOU'RE GOING TO FIND A GIGANTIC ONE OF THOSE LIKE INDUSTRIAL SIZE OF BUCKETS OF BARRELS FULL OF WATER SO YOU GRAB A BUCKET AND DUMP THE WATER AFTER YOU USE THE RESTROOM
THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT THAT WHEN YOU DO OPEN THE SLIDE AND IF THE SLIDE GOES BACK FORWARD NO ROUNDS WILL COME OUT OF THE MAGAZINE AND GO INTO THE FIREARM CHAMBER
THE WAY THAT YOU WOULD OPEN AND CLEAR AND UNLOAD THIS GLOCK 31 WOULD BE YOU WOULD FIRST AND FOREMOST
SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS PULL THIS APART YOU DON'T WANT TO PATCH THE LINING IN THERE AND SEW IT ALL TOGETHER YOU WANT TO OPEN THAT UP
AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU START TO RELAX YOUR CHEEKS WILL FEEL HOLLOW ALLOW THEM TO FEEL HOLLOW JAW'S SLIGHTLY OPEN
AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY BALANCE IT THERE WITHOUT IT SPINNING BUT IF YOU COULD PUT SOME SPIN ON IT AND HAVE THAT CLAW DELAY AND THEN YOU CAN GO TO TWO FINGERS AND THEN ONE FINGER AND YOU'LL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GET CONTROL WHICH WILL OPEN UP THE DOOR TO MANY MANY MANY MORE TRICKS
INHALING OPEN THE HEART AND LIFT THE ARMS
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROCEDURES TO POP THOSE EYES OPEN
I'M JUST GOING TO SHOVE IT THROUGH HERE AND JUST OPEN IT UP
FROM HERE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR LEFT FOOT CROSS BEHIND AND OUR ARM IS GOING TO OPEN UP ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE SERVING AGAIN AT A RESTAURANT AND YOU'RE GOING TO USE THAT AS MOMENTUM TO HELP GET YOU AROUND THREE YOU'RE GOING TO SIT HERE ON FOUR AND HANG OUT
SOME TIMES IF THEY GET BENT DOWN REAL FAR YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO OPEN YOU KEY
AS YOU COME DOWN YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ELBOWS DO NOT COMPLETELY OPEN SO WE WANT TO KEEP THEM ALMOST IN LINE WITH THE SHOULDERS KEEP THE BRIDGE UP
WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP MAYBE LIKE ULTRA BEAT DRUMS AND LOOK IN OUR LIBRARY AND JUST KIND OF SEE WHAT KIND OF KITS THERE ARE AND REALLY JUST MESS AROUND WITH THEM BY CHANGING THE DIFFERENT KICKS USING THE GRID AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ULTRA BEAT AND USING PATTERN MODE BY TRIGGERING EACH PATTERN ONE AT A TIME AND RECORDING THAT DATA
ONCE THIS IS OPEN THIS IS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO CREATE EVERYTHING
WHAT THIS DOES IT CLOSES THE PORES THAT WE OPEN WITH THE HOT TOWEL OR THE HOT WATER
NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS KIND OF OPEN THIS SECTION UP HERE KIND OF GIVE IT A LITTLE ROOM AND THEN HOLD RIGHT HERE AT THE POINT OF THE NECK
NOW OPEN THE WINGS LIKE THIS AND THEN FOLD THEM DOWN PULLING OFF THIS POINT HERE WE'RE GOING TO FOLD IT DOWN IN TO A FORWARD FOLD
IF YOU OPEN IT UP YOU'LL SEE HERE THAT IT'S A GOOD STORAGE PLACE
I CAN OPEN IT DISCARD MY USED TEA LEAVES AND THEN RINSE IT OUT AND ENJOY MY CUP OF TEA
SO FROM THIS POSITION SHUT AND OPEN SHUT AND OPEN
SHOULDERS DOWN AND THE CHEST IS UP AND OPEN
THIS TIME WE ARE GOING TO BE USING THE 6TH STRING THAT'S THAT O IT'S TELLING US TO PLAY IT OPEN OR TO JUST PLUCK THE STRING WITHOUT PRESSING DOWN ON ANY FRETS
WE'RE NOW GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOK AT OUR E SHAPE IN THE OPEN POSITION
SHE'S GOING TO CHAMBER THE HANDS TO THE WAIST START FROM THIS POSITION AND HANDS A LITTLE BIT LOWER ONE AND TWO BOTH HANDS COME OUT THE SAME TIME FIST GOOD KEEPING THEM RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR SHOULDERS OPEN THE HANDS THE PALM CROSS ONE WRIST OVER THE OTHER WRIST BRING THE HANDS DOWN TOUCH THE THIGHS NOW LIFT UP BEND THE ELBOWS AND COME FORWARD
THIS KEEPS THE HEAT FROM TOO MUCH HEAT FORM ESCAPING AROUND YOUR NECK AND YOUR OPEN COLLAR AREA AND THIS ALSO WORKS AS A REGULATOR SO YOU CAN REGULATE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE
WHEN YOU START GETTING TOO WARM YOU CAN OPEN THE SCARF OR TAKE IT OFF AND THEN PUT THE SCARF BACK ON
HOPEFULLY YOU REMEMBERED TO SLICE OPEN THE BUTTON HOLES BEFORE YOU SEWED YOUR CASING
