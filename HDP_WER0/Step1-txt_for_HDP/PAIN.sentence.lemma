IF YOUR FINGERS CRACK THAT'S FINE AS LONG AS YOU DON'T FEEL ANY PAIN
TO IF YOU ARE FEELING PAIN ON YOUR NECK YOU ARE DOING THE EXERCISE INCORRECTLY YOU SHOULD BE FEELING EVERYTHING IN THE ABDOMINALS AND WE WANT THINK ABS CHORD RELEASE
WE ALSO IN OUR CANINE PATIENTS USE A LT OF ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES FOR ARTHRITIS AND PAIN
SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES IN FACT THAT CAN BE USED ON A CHRONIC BASIS OR SHORT TERM BASIS FOR PAIN
ONCE TO YOU GET TO THAT POINT YOU'LL STOP AND YOU HOLD IT FOR THIRTY SECONDS EASE OFF OF IT AND GO BACK AGAIN AND STRETCH UNTIL YOU GET TO THAT POINT WHERE YOU CAN WITHSTAND THE PAIN THAT IS IN YOUR HAMSTRING AS YOU ARE STRETCHING IT
AND QUITE HONESTLY IT USUALLY TAKES A FEW TREATMENTS BUT THIS GENTLEMAN BECAUSE HE DOES TAKE SUCH GOOD CARE OF HIMSELF HE IS VERY PHYSICALLY FIT ONE TREATMENT HE RESPONDED VERY WELL AND THE BACK PAIN WENT AWAY AND DID NOT REOCCUR AFTER THAT
TYPICALLY WE SEE FOR EXAMPLE WITH LOW BACK PAIN I SEE PEOPLE RESPOND IN ANYWHERE FROM ONE TWO ABOUT EIGHT TREATMENTS THAT THEY START TO RESPOND VERY WELL AND SHOW SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT
AFTER FORTY-EIGHT HOURS IF THE PAIN CAME ON GRADUALLY HEAT CAN BE APPLIED IN THE GENERAL AREA OF DISCOMFORT TO INCREASE HEALING AND INCREASE MOBILITY
THEN ICE CAN BE APPLIED TO REDUCE SWELLING AND PAIN
WHEN YOU GET YOUR NOSE PIERCED INITIALLY THE PAIN IS PRETTY MINIMAL IT KIND OF ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE POPPING A ZIT
SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU SEEK COUNSELING MARRIAGE COUNSELING AT THIS POINT BECAUSE TO TO STOP THE THE PAIN AT THAT POINT A PROFESSIONAL PERSON CAN HELP UNDERSTAND HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE CHEATING
ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOUR BODY AND WHENEVER YOUR BODY IS TALKING TO YOU WHETHER IT IS TELLING YOU PAIN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ALWAYS REMEMBER TO FOLLOW WHAT YOUR BODY SAYS
AND WHILE DOING THESE EXERCISES YOU DO HAPPEN TO FEEL PAIN JUST MAKE SURE YOU STOP
NAILS ARE VERY TENDER THERE IS A QUICK WHICH BLEEDS IN THERE IF YOU GET TO FAR OR TOO CLOSE TO IT AND ALSO PETS AND DOGS CAN BITE IF THEY'RE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE OR FEEL PAIN
AS YOU MOVE TOWARDS THE REAR OF THE ANIMAL A LOT OF DOGS ESPECIALLY AS THEY GET OLDER OR HAVE HIP DYSPLASIA GET A LOT OF PAIN INTO THE HIPS
OF COURSE AS WE LEARN ABOUT THE PATIENT AND THE PATIENT ACTUALLY LEARNS A FEW THINGS ABOUT THEMSELVES THEY FIND THAT OTHER THINGS START TO GET BETTER AS WE TREAT THEM ABOUT PAIN
PAIN IS THAT AREA WE'RE PROBABLY BEST KNOWN FOR
TYPICALLY THE MAJORITY OF OUR PATIENTS COME FIRST BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT SOME COMPLAINT ABOUT A PARTICULAR PAIN
BUT CERTAIN CONDITIONS IN PAIN THAT WE HAVE DONE VERY WELL WITH AND THERE ARE MORE THAN WHAT I'M GOING TO MENTION OF COURSE BUT THINGS LIKE MIGRAINE HEADACHES LOW BACK PAIN NECK PAIN JUST ABOUT ANY KIND OF HEADACHE SARAH HAUER ARTHRITIS
IF YOU'RE HAVING ANY LOWER BACK PAIN THIS IS A NICE WAY TO JUST RELEASE ANY TENSION IN YOUR LOWER BACK
AS FAR AS THE PAIN RELIEVERS GO THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT WE CAN PRESENT TO A PATIENT WHO AGAIN HAS PROBLEMS DEALING WITH THE ANXIETY OR MORE OR LESS THE PAIN
THIS IS A GREAT POINT FOR TREATING OVERALL FOR THE WHOLE HEAD SO NO MATTER WHERE THE PAIN IS ORIGINATING JUST GIVING IT SOME LIGHT OR DEEP MASSAGE CAN BE VERY HELPFUL
AFTER A VISIT WITH THE CHIROPRACTOR SHE EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THE DISCS IN MY LOW BACK WERE A LITTLE BIT SWOLLEN SOME OF THE JOINTS HAD SOME ADDITIONAL INFLAMMATION AROUND THERE WHICH WERE CUTTING OFF SOME OF THE NERVE SUPPLY DOWN INTO MY LEGS AND I WAS ACTUALLY EXPERIENCING SOME NUMBNESS IN ADDITION TO THE LOW BACK PAIN NUMBNESS GOING DOWN MY LEGS AND AFTER JUST TWO TREATMENTS OF CHIROPRACTICS MY LOW BACK FELT 100 %PERCENT BETTER
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU KNOW I HAVE THIS PAIN HERE
SO AGAIN THERE IS A GREAT CORRELATION TO THE LOWER BACK AND TO HOW THINGS WORK AS WELL AS WITH PAIN
PATIENTS OFTEN ASK ME HOW IS IT THAT THE SPINE RELATES TO THE SYMPTOMS THAT I HAVE HAVING HOW IS IT THAT THE SPINE THESE BONES ARE CREATING PAIN OR SOME KIND OF DYSFUNCTION I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO IS THAT THE SPINE IS THE HOUSE THAT PROTECTS THE NERVES THAT ARE TRANSMITTING THESE MESSAGES AND SO AS THE SPINE GETS MISALIGNED AS THE SPINE GETS TORN OR TWISTED OR WHAT HAVE YOU IT PUTS PRESSURE ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT THEN IS SENDING THE MESSAGE OUT AND WHICH CAN BE PAIN OR FUNCTION
SO PAIN FIBERS ARE BEING AFFECTED AND THEY ARE GOING TO FEEL PAIN WHETHER IT IS BURNING OR RADIATING PAIN LOCAL PAIN MUSCLE TENSION PRESSURE OR THOSE KINDS OF THINGS
AND SO IT COULDN'T BITE OR CHEW AND IT JUST SCREAMED OUT IN PAIN BUT THE LITTLE FISH SAID OH I TOOK DENTISTRY SCHOOL I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU BIG FISH BIG SHARK
SO I LIKE TO DO IS LITTLE CIRCLES IN THIS LOCATION AND JUST CLOSE MY EYES AND RELAX AND WITH THE PRESSURE JUST FEEL THE MUSCLES UNDERNEATH RELAXING FREEING UP CLEARING OF ANY PAIN
WHEN YOU DO STAKE OUT YOUR TENT YOU WANT TO PUT THEM IN AT A FORTY-FIVE DEGREE ANGLE INTO THE GROUND AND DON'T BEAT THEM ALL THE WAY INTO THE GROUND IT'S A PAIN IN THE BUTT TO THEN GET THEM OUT
PAIN IS NOT GOOD NO PAIN BUT MILD DISCOMFORT IS GOOD
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAY WE PERCEIVE PAIN IN THE BODY
STRAIN COUNTER STRAIN WAS DEVELOPED IN THE 70'S BY LAWRENCE JONES AND THE BASIS TO THE TECHNIQUE IS TO SHORTEN THE MUSCLE THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH IN ORDER TO RELEASE IT AND TO RESET THE PAIN MECHANISM
BUT IT'S A PAIN IN THE NECK AMONG OTHER THINGS SO WE ARE JUST GOING TO SPREAD THAT DOWN AND THEN MEASURE IT OUT
AT THAT POINT THE PATIENT IS GENERALLY OFF PAIN MEDICINE AND COMPLETING A SHORT COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS AND STARTING TO GET BACK TO THEIR NORMAL ROUTINE
LIKE I SAID THIS IS KIND OF A PAIN
THE DAMPNESS IF THE LEG TENDS TO SWELL UP OR IF THE DOG RESPONDS AND IS IN WORSE PAIN ON DAMP DAYS THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD POINT FOR YOU TO USE
THEY DON'T HAVE LOW BACK PAIN THEY DON'T HAVE NECK PAIN
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE AND I'M GOING TO PINCH THE EAR A LITTLE BIT SO THAT IT DOESN'T HURT MATT SO MUCH BECAUSE EARS CAN BE SENSITIVE AND MOST MEN THAT I'VE TREATED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS DO NOT HAVE A GREAT PAIN TOLERANCE
IT'S VERY HARD TO DESCRIBE WHAT A LABOR PAIN FEELS LIKE BECAUSE IT FEELS DIFFERENT FOR EVER WOMAN
SO YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OUT WHERE THE SOURCE OF THE TROUBLE IS YOU'RE GOING TO ASK IS THE PAIN GOING UP OR DOWN
IF THEY'RE HAVING PAIN THROUGHOUT THEIR BACK AGAIN YOU JUST WANT TO DO NICE LIGHT MOVEMENTS MAYBE A COUPLE OF CIRCLES AROUND THE SPINE
OVERALL SHORT TERM RELIEF IS BASICALLY WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT AND SO WHETHER IT IS PAIN OR FUNCTION WISE WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THINGS RETURN BACK TO A NORMAL STATE
PATIENTS THAT COME IN PAIN USUALLY PRETTY QUICKLY EVEN SOMETIMES AFTER THEIR FIRST PAIN HAVE A REDUCTION IN THEIR PAIN LEVELS
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SHORT TERM BENEFITS OF GETTING THINGS ADJUSTED AND OF COURSE IF SOMEONE IS IN PAIN THEIR IMMEDIATE DESIRE IS TO GET OUT OF PAIN SO USUALLY THE FIRST AND THE MOST QUICKLY RELIEVED SITUATION WITH CHIROPRACTIC CARE IS PAIN
IT ALSO HELPS WITH PAIN CONTROL AS WELL
THERE IS OTHER FORMS SUCH AS ORAL SEDATION WHICH WOULD INVOLVE TAKING A PILL BEFORE THE APPOINTMENT AND THAT KIND OF HELPS CREATE KIND OF HELPS RELIEVE SOME OF THAT ANXIETY AND CAN CERTAINLY HELP WITH PAIN AS WELL
IT KIND OF HELPS CREATE AMNESIA HELPS WITH PAIN CONTROL AND MAKES IT A VERY COMFORTABLE EXPERIENCE FOR THE PATIENT
WELL FIRST OF ALL MUSCLE PAIN AND CRAMPING SPECIFICALLY CAN TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE OVERWORKING A MUSCLE
HI MY NAME IS ASHLEY LUDMAN FROM SEASIDE YOGA HERE TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION HOW DO I REDUCE MUSCLE PAIN WHEN I'M PRACTICING PILATES
NOW A LOT OF DOGS MAY GET PAIN IN THEIR UPPER SHOULDERS AND WHAT YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS GET THE CIRCULATION MOVING THROUGH THEIR SHOULDERS
IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT PAIN AND AILMENTS IN A DOG
WHEN YOU'RE DOING DOG MASSAGE EVERY DOG IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW FROM SPEAKING WITH YOUR VET WHERE YOUR DOG'S PAIN AND AILMENTS ARE
THAT RESETS THE STRETCH RECEPTOR ON THE MUSCLE AND PUTS IT BACK AT AN APPROPRIATE SETTING AND MIRACULOUSLY THE PAIN GOES AWAY RIGHT AWAY
