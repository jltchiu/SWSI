HI MY NAME IS BRANDON SARKIS ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE.  TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE HOLIDAY PUDDING.  OKAY SO NOW YOU CAN SEE THAT WE'VE GOT A MIXTURE THAT LOOKS KIND OF LIKE LOOKS LIKE MUFFIN BATTER ACTUALLY.  SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR MOLASSES NOW AND WE'RE GOING TO ADD ALL OF THAT IN AT ONCE.  AND YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE YOUR SPATULA AROUND.  AND IT DOESN'T MATTER MY SPATULA HAS GOT FLOUR ON IT ALREADY BECAUSE BECAUSE IT'S ALL THE SAME MIXTURE.  YOU KNOW IF THIS WERE A DIFFERENT INGREDIENT I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY GET A DIFFERENT SPATULA.  BUT SINCE ALL THAT'S IN THERE IS THE YOU KNOW ALL THAT THE SPATULA'S TOUCHED IS EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE PRODUCT OR EVERYTHING IS ALREADY IN THE END PRODUCT IT REALLY MAKES NO DIFFERENCE.  SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET ALL OF YOUR MOLASSES THERE WE GO.  THAT IS ALL OF MY MOLASSES.  AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO RAISE THE BOWL BACK UP AND SLOWLY STIR THAT IN.  AND IT MAKES KIND OF A GOOPY MESS.  AND IT'S GOING TO END UP LOOKING LIKE A KIND OF LIKE A REALLY DARK THICK RUNNY LIKE PANCAKE BATTER ALMOST.  YOU WANT IT TO REACH THE RIGHT TEXTURE AND CONSISTENCY.  LET'S TURN IT UP A LITTLE BIT.  OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO LET THIS GO UNTIL THERE ARE NO LUMPS IN IT WHICH WILL PROBABLY TAKE SEVERAL MINUTES.  SO I WILL COME BACK WHEN IT'S REACHED THAT POINT AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT STEP THEN.  OKAY SO IT'S BEEN A FEW MINUTES.  YOU CAN SEE THAT WE'VE GOT NO LUMPS IN THERE TO SPEAK OF.  SO NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS I'VE ALREADY SCRAPED IT DOWN TOO I'M JUST GOING TO VERY SLOWLY ADD MY MILK IN.  I'M TALKING LIKE AT A TRICKLE.  AND WHAT THIS IS DOING IS
A LOT OF THE OTHER STUDIOS IN THIS AREA ARE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN $65 TO $125 AN HOUR AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET A GREAT PRODUCT OUT OF THOSE
WHAT THIS DOES IS IT ALLOWS THE MANMADE MANUFACTURED PRODUCT TO BE EXACTLY THE SAME SO YOU'VE GOT PRECISELY MATCHING DRONE REEDS
WITH THE MOISTURIZER APPLICATION IT'S TRULY KEY TO DO THIS FIRST BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO APPLY A POWDER FOUNDATION OR VERY DRY SKIN OR FLAKEY SKIN IT ACTUALLY WILL SET IN THOSE FLAKES OR SET IN THOSE DRY FINE LINES SO APPLYING MOISTURIZER IS GOING TO ALLOW THE PRODUCT TO SET VERY EVENLY IN THE SKIN
THIS PRODUCT ALSO HAS SOME SPF IN IT IN THE MILD TINT THAT'S GOING TO REFLECT DARK CIRCLES
THE PRODUCT THAT I CHOSE IS CALLED TOTAL EYE CARE
SO THIS IS JUST A LITTLE BIT COOLER THAN THE OTHERS BUT IT'S STILL GOING TO REMOVE THE PRODUCT SO SHE DOESN'T YOU KNOW GO HOME WITH ANYTHING LEFT ON HER CLOTHES AND WE'LL JUST QUICKLY JUST WIPE AND GENTLY WIPE THE AREA WE COVERED AND ALREADY HER SKIN IS SO MUCH SMOOTHER
SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO REMOVE ANY RESIDUAL PRODUCT WITH A WARM TOWEL AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS ONE'S A LITTLE BIT COOLER THAN THE OTHERS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO REOPEN HER PORES AGAIN
AND ONCE WE REMOVE THE MASK FROM HER BACK WE'RE GOING TO END THE TREATMENT NOW WITH A LITTLE SPRITZ OF A TONER AND THIS IS JUST REFRESHING FOR THE SKIN AND JUST TO ADD TO TIGHTEN UP THE PORES AND CLOSE EVERYTHING DOWN AND YOU JUST WANT TO GENTLY STROKE HER BACK AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT THE PRODUCT IS NICE AND ABSORBED
SO DO YOUR HOMEWORK WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCING AND WHEN IT COMES TO LEASING AND WHEN IT COMES TO JUST THE OVERALL CREDIT WORTHINESS OF WHAT YOU THINK YOU CAN BUY CAUSE YOU MAY BE DRIVING IN A CAR AS OPPOSED TO NOT DRIVING IN A CAR IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE RIGHT PRODUCT LINE
THERE IS A SHOPPING TECHNIQUE YOU CAN DO WHEN YOU DO ONLINE SHOPPING WHERE YOU LOOK SOMETHING UP ON A STORE SITE IF YOU FIND A PRODUCT THAT YOU LIKE YOU THEN YOU GO TO THE MANUFACTURER'S SITE AND YOU SEE IF THE MANUFACTURER WILL SELL IT TO YOU DIRECTLY FROM THEIR WAREHOUSE FOR LESS
A LONG WARRANTY ON A MOTOR IS A WONDERFUL INDICATOR OF HOW THE MANUFACTURER BACKS THEIR PRODUCT
OKAY SO THIS IS OUR FINISH PRODUCT
HERE IS OUR FINISHED PRODUCT
YOU CAN SEE ALL MY PRODUCT AND DESIGNS THERE BUT WE WANT TO ADD SOME MEDIA TO THE PAGE JUST TO BRING IT UP A LITTLE BIT
I WANT TO SPRUCE THE PRODUCT PAGE JUST A LITTLE BIT
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OUR PRODUCT PAGE UP
THERE'S YOUR FINISHED PRODUCT
ONE THING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THE QUALITY OF YOUR WATER SO WHENEVER YOU SET UP YOUR WATER TANK YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE USING A PRODUCT THAT'S GOING TO REMOVE THE CHLORINES CHLORAMINES AND AMMONIAS OUT OF YOUR TANK SO WATER QUALITY IS VERY IMPORTANT
BUT YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE GETTING A QUALITY PRODUCT
YOU CAN USE THE POWER ZOOM AND LASER WHITENING IN OFFICE AND BE PARTICULARLY CAREFUL OF COVERING UP ANY AREAS WHERE YOUR ENAMEL IS THIN OR RESTRUCTURE IS EXPOSED CERTAINLY COVERING UP YOUR GUM TISSUE MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN YOU CAN A PERSON WITH SENSITIVE TEETH CAN BLEACH USING A HOME PRODUCT
THE GREATEST RISK IN TOOTH WHITENING PRODUCT USED IS CREATING HYPERSENSITIVE TEETH
NOW IF YOU GO ON THE FDA'S WEBSITE WHO ORIGINALLY BANNED THE ABSINTHE PRODUCT CONTAINING WORMWOOD YOU'LL SEE THE POSSIBLE HEALTH HAZARDS
OKAY HERE WE GO OUR FINISHED PRODUCT
LAVENDER ESSENTIAL OIL WHICH IS AN INCREDIBLY PURE PRODUCT THIS IS A DAILY SKIN MOISTURIZER
BUT AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY SEE WITH THIS PRODUCT IT DOESN'T HAVE A TENDENCY TO RAISE THE GRAIN AS MUCH AS THE OIL BASED STAIN AND IN THE CASE I DIDN'T CONDITION THE WOOD AT ALL
THE IDEA IS WITH THE FINISHED PRODUCT BECAUSE YOU WANT A BREAD THAT IS ABLE TO BE PULLED APART BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT TO COOK THAT WAY
THIS PRODUCT WILL STILL INVITE LIGHT THROUGH AND INTO YOUR PICTURE WHICH WILL FADE YOUR PICTURE AND IT HAS NO UV PROPERTIES IN IT
YOU ALSO ONCE YOU USE A TOPICAL OINTMENT IT IS ADVISED NOT TO FLEA BATH THE ANIMAL OR FLEA DIP THE ANIMAL OR SPRAY THE ANIMAL WITH ANY OTHER KIND OF FLEA PRODUCT
OKAY NEXT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THESE BACK TO THE IRONING BOARD AND PRESS THEM MAKING SURE THAT THE SEAM THAT WE JUST PRESSED IS TO THE INSIDE SO THAT DOESN'T SHOW ON OUR FINISHED PRODUCT
SO IF YOU SEE ANY OF THOSE ABBREVIATIONS YOU KNOW THAT THAT PARTICULAR PRODUCT STILL HAS PHTHALATES IN IT
YOU CAN PUT THE PRODUCT IN HERE OR WHATEVER AND JUST PUSH IT DOWN YOU'RE SQUISHING THE FLAVORS OUT IT'S JUST A WONDERFUL THING
THIS IS CALLED ACUREL WE LOVE THIS PRODUCT
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF MAKING YOUR OWN VERSUS BUYING A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT
THE WOOD STAINS LAST A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND THEY'VE GOT A PRODUCT OUT THERE NOW CALLED A GOURD INK DYE THAT IS MORE COLOR FAST
NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ALL NATURAL MAKEUP LINES IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BUT I PREFER THEM ESPECIALLY FOR SKIN THAT IS PROBLEMATIC ROSACEA ACNE AND JUST FOR PEOPLE THAT THAT REALLY CARE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR SKIN WITH AN ALL NATURAL VEGAN PRODUCT
ANOTHER PRODUCT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO USE AFTER YOU ARE FINISHED YOUR BLOWOUT ARE DIFFERENT PALM AIDES WAXES CREAMS IN ORDER TO CREATE SEPARATION KEEP YOUR HAIR EXACTLY THE WAY IT SHOULD BE
IT ALMOST ACTS LIKE A HAIRSPRAY BUT WITHOUT ALL THE ALCOHOL IN THE PRODUCT
THIS IS A PENANG CURRY WHICH YOU WOULD USE WITH LIKE A NOODLE TYPE PRODUCT
THERE IS A PRODUCT THAT YOU CAN USE THAT YOU CAN ADD TO THE AN HERBAL PRODUCT AN HERBAL ADDITIVE THAT YOU CAN ADD TO THE LITTER BOX THAT WILL HELP ATTRACT THE CAT TO THE LITTER BOX THAT CAN BE AN ADDED BENEFIT AS YOU MOVE THROUGH THE PHASES
BASICALLY JUST HAVE THE PRODUCT IN THE HOLE
I AM MAKING SURE TO APPLY ENOUGH PRODUCT THAT I CAN THEN KIND OF SMOOSH INTO THE CRACK PUSH IT UP INTO THE AREA AND THEN WIPE IT OFF OF THE SURFACE WIPE ALL THE EXCESS OFF
THEY CONTRACTED WITH A TIRE COMPANY WHO HAD A PRODUCT
IF YOU HAVE QUITE DRY SKIN STAY AWAY FROM AN ALCOHOL BASED PRODUCT USE AN ALCOHOL-FREE TONER
THERE'S ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY IN COST THAT YOU CAN T FIND IF YOU BUY A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT
SO REMEMBER SOME PRODUCT LINES WILL ALLOW YOU TO FINANCE A CAR AND ACTUALLY ACHIEVE A LOAN FOR YOU THAN OTHERS
ON THE BOTTOM OF EACH PRODUCT THERE IS A BAR CODE WITH A UPC CODE
THE NEXT PRODUCT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS ONE OF THE FIRST NATURAL OILS
NOW THERE IS A PRODUCT YOU CAN BUY THAT ACTUALLY FITS RIGHT INTO THE TOILET HERE THAT HAS STARTS OUT WITH NO HOLE AND IT GETS A BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER HOLE
BUT WHAT IT INVOLVES WHAT IT BASICALLY MEANS IS YOU TAKE A PIECE OF CANVAS LIKE THIS AND THROUGH A PROCESS THAT REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT OF WORK YOU END UP WITH A PRODUCT LIKE THIS WHERE IT'S BASICALLY WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENED IS THE CANVAS IS WRAPPED AROUND SOME PIECES OF WOOD STRETCHER BARS AND SECURED IN THE BACK
SO KEEP IT VERY LIGHT YOU CAN SEE THIS SIDE IT'S VERY STIFF AND THIS SIDE IS VERY LIGHT IT'S STILL DOES HAVE PRODUCT IN IT
THIRTY FORTY YEARS AGO WE WERE ALL TAUGHT NON GLARE GLASS IS THE BEST PRODUCT IN THE WORLD FOR YOUR PRODUCT SINCE THEN WE HAVE LEARNED OTHERWISE
THE PEELING TO THIS PRODUCT IS JUST AWFUL
AS FAR AS THE PINS GO THEY OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY TO FAIRLY QUICKLY MAKE A FINISHED PROJECT PRODUCT THAT IS USEFUL THAT PEOPLE ENJOY AND THAT IS FUN TO MAKE
IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT IT GOES BACK TO THE OLD SCHOOL THOUGHT THOUGH
THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT RIGHT HERE IS ONE OF THE HARDEST ONES THAT I FOUND TO DEAL WITH
IT IS A FAUX LOOK IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN AGED AND THEN THEY TOOK AND MADE THE FRAME AND PRODUCT OUT OF IT
AND THERE IS A PRODUCT THAT I USUALLY PUT ON THAT MAKES THOSE HAIRS
WE DO NOT NEED TOO MUCH PRODUCT JUST PUT A LITTLE BIT ON YOUR PUTTY KNIFE AND WE ARE GOING TO GO RIGHT OVER THEM AND JUST KIND OF FILL THEM IN
SO KEEP IN MIND YOUR COST OF YOUR PRODUCT TO BEGIN WITH AND YOUR MATERIALS PLUS HOW MANY HOURS YOU HAVE IN THE WORK AND WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE MARKETING YOUR PIECE AT
AND THIS BRUSH IS GOING TO REALLY BLEND IT WELL IT APPLIES THE PRODUCT
LIGHT IT SO EVERYTHING IS VISIBLE AND THEN COME BACK IN AND USE OTHER LIGHTS TO USE TO CREATE HIGHLIGHTS DRAMA DIFFUSION SO THAT YOU NOT SEEING DISTRACTING REFLECTIONS OR REFRACTIONS ON THE SURFACE OF THE INSTRUMENTS AND THEN COME UP WITH A LIGHTING SYSTEM THAT WORKS TO HELP SEPARATE IT FROM THE BACKGROUND AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET SOME PRETTY INTERESTING PRODUCT SHOTS
EVERY PRODUCT IS DIFFERENT
I ADJUST THE PRESSURE WAY DOWN TO PUT IT ON A DECK BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO THIS YOUR NOZZLE OR YOUR TIP IS ONLY GOING TO BE ABOUT SIX TO TEN INCHES OFF YOUR DECK AND YOU SPRAY IT BACK AND FORTH AND PUT YOUR PRODUCT WHEN YOU NEED IT AND THEN MY HELP COMES ALONG AND YOU PAD IT DOWN INTO THE DECK AND IT MAKES A GREAT FINISH
WE ARE GOING TO BE USING A BEHR PRODUCT WHICH IS RATED ABOUT NUMBER ONE AND THIS IS A SOLID STAIN TO MATCH THE DECK AND COVER UP EVERYTHING
LIKE I SAID THIS IS A BEHR PRODUCT AND THIS IS A NEW THING THEY HAD COME OUT WHICH IS TEN YEARS ON DECKS AND 25 YEARS ON SIDING BECAUSE YOUR DECKING TAKES SUCH ABUSE FROM WALKING ON AND THE ELEMENTS AND THE SUN AND EVERYTHING TEN YEARS IS REALLY GREAT ON THIS PRODUCT AND ALSO IT IS VERY VERY THICK
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A PRODUCT THAT'S GREAT AND WORTHY OF BEING PLAYED FOR PEOPLE
SINCE YOU'RE SPENDING MONEY ON A PRODUCT IT SHOULD REALLY WORK
THERE A GOOD TRICK IS IF THE CONCEALER REALLY COVERS UP IS TO IF YOU ARE IN THE STORE AND YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO TEST YOUR PRODUCT IS TO CHECK ON THE BACK OF YOUR HAND AND TRY TO COVER UP YOU KNOW ANY BLUE VEINS THAT YOU SEE THERE USUALLY A LITTLE MORE VISIBLE ON FAIR-SKIN PEOPLE
EGG REPLACER IS ALSO A REALLY GOOD PRODUCT TO HAVE IN HAND
SO YOU WANT TO BE SURE WHATEVER YOU ARE WORKING WITH YOU PICK OUT THE CORRECT PRODUCT
EVEN WITH NO PRODUCT SHE'S STILL GETTING THE SMOOTHNESS
THE REASON THAT YOU DO THAT IS SO THAT YOU GET A COFFEE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED IF YOU HAVE A COFFEE IN ONE AREA OF THE PUCK THAT IS LESS EVENLY DISTRIBUTED YOU HAVE LESS COFFEE THAN ANOTHER AREA IN THE PUCK AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE THAT THE WATER IS GOING TO TRAVEL THROUGH WHEN YOU'RE BREWING AN ESPRESSO WHICH IS AN EXTRACTION FLAW WHICH IS GOING TO END UP IN THE END PRODUCT OF THE CUP OF ESPRESSO
BUT MOVIE STARS TYPICALLY ARE THE ONES THAT GET A MOVE MADE AND THEY ARE HIRED BY THE DIRECTORS AND THE STUDIOS THAT WANT TO INSURE THAT THIS PRODUCT IS GIVEN EVERY BEST CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING
THE THICKER THE UPHOLSTERY IS AND THE MORE YOU CAN FEEL IT AND PULL ON IT AND IT GOES RIGHT BACK TO NORMAL NEW USE IS GOING TO SHOW YOU YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BETTER QUALITY PRODUCT
AND THEY'RE WANTING TO KNOW WHY IT'S LIKE THAT AND I'M HAVING TO EXPLAIN TO THE THAT WHEN THEY PUT THE COLOR ON THEIR HAIR FIVE WEEKS AGO THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T USE A GOOD PRODUCT OR A GOOD SHAMPOO AND THE COLOR HAS FADED OFF
WE HAVE JUST APPLIED THE VITAMIN C MASK ON MY ASSISTANT AND WHILE THAT IS SEEPING INTO HER PORES AND WHILE SHE IS GETTING THE MAXIMUM BENEFITS OF THE MASK WE ARE GOING TO DO A NICE SHOULDER MASSAGE FOR HER AND THIS WILL HELP HER RELAXATION BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE MAJOR ESSENTIAL BENEFITS OF GETTING A FACIAL NOT ONLY IN A VITAMIN C FACIAL BUT IN ANY FACIAL TREATMENTS THAT ANYONE OFFERS AND AGAIN WE ARE REALLY ALLOWING TIME FOR THE MASK TO ABSORB INTO MY ASSISTANT'S SKIN HAIR SO SHE CAN REALLY SEE THE BENEFITS OF THAT VITAMIN C WHICH ARE TONING LIFTING AND FIRMING THE SKIN AND ALSO BRIGHTENING THE COMPLEXION AND YOU WANT TO DO THE MASSAGE FOR A GOOD FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES A LITTLE BIT LONGER IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT EXTRA TIME AND JUST REALLY WE ARE CATERING TO HER TENSION SPOTS WHICH FOR MOST PEOPLE ARE USUALLY THE TOPS OF THE SHOULDERS HERE AND THE NECK AREA AND WHEN THE CLIENT IS RELAXED THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A BETTER EXPERIENCE FIRST OF ALL BUT STATISTICALLY THE PRODUCT IS ABSORBED BETTER TOO IF THE CLIENT IS JUST RELAXED AND OPEN TO RECEIVE TREATMENT
TO AVOID GETTING PIMPLES GENTLY EXFOLIATE THE SKIN WITH A PRODUCT SPECIFICALLY FORMULATED FOR OILY OR COMBINATION SKIN
STEAM YOUR FACE OVER HOT WATER TO UNCLOG PORES ONCE EVERY THREE DAYS AND USE AN OVER THE COUNTER BENZOYL PEROXIDE PRODUCT
A GREAT PRODUCT THAT IS A LITTLE STRANGE BUT WORKS REALLY REALLY GREAT FOR MIXING YOUR GLAZE IS A TOILET BRUSH BELIEVE IT OR NOT
NOW IF YOU WANT TO USE A PRODUCT JUST STRAIGHT FROM THE KITCHEN DON'T WANT TO SPEND ANY MONEY EGG WHITES
IN ORDER TO HAVE THE PROCESSING PLUS PRODUCT
WHEN I DO GOOGLE SEARCH FOR IT WE SEE THAT EVEN BY UPC CODE I CAN GET INFORMATION ON THE PRODUCT
YOU DO WANT TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF MOUSSE IN YOUR HAIR A LITTLE BIT OF GEL LITTLE BIT OF STYLING PRODUCT FOR YOUR HAIR TYPE TO SET THAT CURL
THEY'RE A PRODUCT OF THE BLACK FOREST IN GERMANY
ANY HAIRSTYLE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO USE A LOT OF PRODUCT
IF YOU HAVE YOUR CAN YOU KNOW THE AEROSOL CAN AND THERE'S STILL SOME PRODUCT LEFT IN IT YOU NEED TO CLEAN THAT RIGHT AWAY
THE PRODUCT WAS A WIDER SOFTER TIRE AND SCHWINN HAD TO ORDER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THESE TIRES AND THEY HAD TO BUILD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THESE VINTAGE BICYCLES TO SATISFY THE DEMAND AND CREATE THESE BICYCLES
SO I WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS JUST TAKE A 409 OR A FANTASTIC PRODUCT AND I AM JUST GOING TO REALLY SPRAY
ANOTHER REALLY GOOD PRODUCT OUT ON THE MARKET IS CALLED THE LANSKY SYSTEM
ONCE THE BY PRODUCT IS ACID ONCE THE ACID EATS THROUGH THE HARD OUTER SHELL OF THE TOOTH IT CAN THE BACTERIA CAN NOW LIVE OFF OF THE INTERNAL PORTION OF THE TOOTH
IF YOU HAVE MORE EXTREME AREAS THAT YOU NEED A LITTLE BIT HEAVIER COVERAGE ON SOMETIMES A SPONGE WILL WORK A LITTLE BIT BETTER FOR YOU BECAUSE IT WILL HOLD A LITTLE BIT MORE CONCENTRATION OF PRODUCT IN THERE THEN YOU CAN PAT IT ON
DOES THE MANUFACTURE REALLY SUPPORT ITS PRODUCT
OH IT'S VERY SAFE THE PRODUCT THAT I USE IS THE LEAST HARMFUL TO YOUR HAIR WHEN YOU'RE TAKING IT OUT IT CAUSES LESS BREAKAGE AND LESS DAMAGE VS ALL THE PRODUCTS THAT I'VE USED ON THE MARKET THIS IS THE BEST ONE BY FAR
YOU STILL GOT TO USE THE PRODUCT BECAUSE WE KNOW GOLD IS VERY ADAPTABLE IN THE MOUTH AND THE BODY IS VERY FORGIVING WITH THE GOLD
