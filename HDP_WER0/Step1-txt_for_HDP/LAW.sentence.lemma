WE ALSO HAVE SOME COMPUTER PROGRAMS THAT WE USE SO THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT PARK RANGERS DO THAT PROBABLY NORMAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DON'T DO AND THAT IS JUST TYPICAL AND PART OF THE JOB AND THAT IS KIND OF A GOOD THING BECAUSE IT BREAKS UP THE MONOTONY MOST OF THE TIME BECAUSE YOU CAN BE DOING ONE THING AND THEN HAVE TO SWITCH HATS SO IT IS A GOOD JOB
WE DO SOME OTHER THINGS BESIDES LAW ENFORCEMENT
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE A SUMMER INTERNSHIP AT A LAW FIRM
YOU HAVE TO HAVE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS YOU HAVE TO BE A CERTAIN AGE THEY DO REQUIRE COLLEGE AND/OR SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERIENCE
AND PUERTO RICO SOMETHING TO NOTE THE LIGHT RUMS ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO BE DISTILLED FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR AND FOR THE DARK RUMS THOSE ARE REQUIRED TO BE DISTILLED FOR THREE YEARS
AND SO IF YOU ARE GOOD AT COMMUNITY SPEAKING NOT AFRAID OF IT YOU'LL DO WELL WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT
NOW THERE WAS ONE CHINESE SAILOR HE WAS A MILITARY LEADER THAT ACTUALLY TRAVELED TO OKINAWA HIS NAME WAS KO SOKU AND HE CAME AND DID ALOT OF TRADE WITH THE OKINAWANS AND SHOWED THEM ALOT OF TECHINQUES OR WHAT THEY CALLED TRU ANFA OR LONG FIST BOXING OR AS LIKE KENPO LAW OF THE FIST WAS THE LITERAL TRANSLATION FOR THAT
MELANIE HIGGINS A JUNIOR ATTORNEY AT THE PRESTIGIOUS NEW YORK LAW FIRM [SOUNDS LIKE] HARPER AND HIGGINS DISCOVERS THAT HER BOSS IS WINNING ALL OF HIS CASES BY MURDERING KEY WITNESSES BLAH-BLAH-BLAH WITH THE HELP OF HER OLD LOVER AND HER NEW FLING BLAH-BLAH-BLAH
THEY CAN ALSO WORK WITH ALCOHOL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THEIR OWN STATES TO WHERE THEY ACTUALLY ARE TRAINED TO GO IN AND DO THINGS LIKE ALCOHOL PURCHASE SURVEYS TO WHERE THEY'LL GO IN AND ACTUALLY GO TO A CONVENIENCE STORE AND TRY AND PURCHASE ALCOHOL AND THEN WE TRACK THOSE AND SAY LOOK THERE'S AN ISSUE HERE
WHAT WE'LL DO IS PLACE OURSELVES IN OUR HARNESS BUCKLE OUR SEAT BELTS BECAUSE THAT'S THE LAW AND NOW WE'LL GO FOR A RIDE
NOW THIS IS THE SHOT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY GET A THRILL OUT OF BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO DEFY THE LAW OF PHYSICS
YOU CAN NOT BE A BOUNTY HUNTER IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN TO THE CLASS EACH STATE LAW VARIES
THEY ARE AN EXCELLENT SOURCE OF AN EXPERT SO IF YOU HAVE ANY CONNECTIONS TO A COLLEGE OR A UNIVERSITY YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT USING A FACULTY MEMBER FOR YOUR EXPERT TO INTERVIEW BUT EXPERTS COULD BE POLITICIANS LAW MAKERS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS MEDICAL PERSONNEL THEY ARE EXPERTS AT WHAT THEY DO RESEARCHERS RELIGIOUS LEADERS COMMUNITY LEADERS THOSE ARE YOUR TOP CHOICES FOR EXPERTS FOR MANY MANY SUBJECTS BUT IN A MINUTE I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE NOT SO OBVIOUS EXPERT
TREAT THE LAW OFFICER WITH RESPECT AND ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS TRUTHFULLY DON'T BE DISRESPECTFUL AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN A LOT BETTER SHAPE
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE DON'T GIVE MUCH THOUGHT TO BEFORE THEY GO OUT IN THE FIELD IS HOW THEY ARE GOING TO HANDLE AN ENCOUNTER WITH ANOTHER HUNTER OR A LAW OFFICER IN THE FIELD
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO WIN AN ARGUMENT WITH A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER SO THERE IS REALLY NO SENSE IN DISAGREEING WITH HIM
AND I SAY ANYONE LIKE THAT MEANING A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER
ANY WORKING DOG GUIDE ACCOMPANYING A DISABLED PERSON IS ALLOWED IN ANY PREMISES SO EVEN IF THERE IS A SIGN THAT SAYS NO DOGS ALLOWED YOU ARE STILL ENTITLED BY LAW TO TAKE YOUR DOG GUIDE INTO THAT PREMISES WHETHER IT'S A SHOP OR A HOTEL OR A RESTAURANT
YOU ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE YOUR DOG BY LAW
WE WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT BY PROVIDING THEM WITH EQUIPMENT THAT THEY CAN USE
