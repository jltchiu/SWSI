I CAN DROP MY CHEST A LITTLE BIT MORE TO PUT MORE WEIGHT ON THAT FRONT WHEEL WHICH IS IMPORTANT ANY TIME YOU WANT TO SLOW DOWN BECAUSE MOST OF YOUR BRAKING IS COMING FROM YOUR FRONT BRAKE AND IT IS IMPORTANT ANY TIME YOU JUST NEED TO BE MORE STABLE
HIS GOAL IS TO HIT IT RIGHT ABOVE THE TEN EITHER REAL SOFT SO IT JUST COMES OUT AS A WINNING DROP SHOT OR HE'S GOING TO ATTACK THE NECK

THE ONLY THING IS ONCE WE'RE IN THE AIR AND WE HAVE BOTH FEET UP WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO MEET THEM TOGETHER AND DROP THEM TOGETHER SO THEY'RE TOUCHING WHEN YOU HIT THE GROUND
SO WHEN I DROP MY HANDS I USE THIS MOMENTUM TO BRING MY HIPS TO THE SIDE ALL THE WAY OVER
DROP YOUR HANDS
KEEP YOUR SHOULDER BLADE DOWN AND THE BACK ARM IS GOING TO GO STRAIGHT UP NICE PRETTY FINGERS DON'T LET THE ENERGY DROP OR BE DIRECTED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
WE'RE GOING TO PEEL OFF SMALL SECTIONS OF CARDS AND DROP THEM LIKE THIS
ALRIGHT SO ONE OF THE WAYS TO GET INTO THE TORSO HOOPING IS TO LIFT UP TO THE NECK AND THEN DROP THE SHOULDERS IN
SO AS WE'VE STEPPED BACK WITH OUR RIGHT LEG INTO A NICE DEEP LUNGE FROM HERE IF WE WANT TO CHOOSE A KNEELING OPTIONS WE'LL DROP TO THE KNEE AND UNCURL THE TOE
AND OF COURSE EVERYTHING I'VE SHOWED YOU SO FAR LIKE THE SCREENPLAY STAGE PLAY THE AUDIO-VIDEO SCRIPT AND THE AUDIO PLAY SCRIPT ARE VERY SPECIFIC FORMATTING IN THIS DROP DOWN MENU RIGHT
NOW DROP YOUR HAND TO THE SIDE
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR BOTTOM DOESN'T DROP PUTTING PRESSURE ON YOUR LOWER BACK
SO YOU'RE JUST GOING TO COME HERE DROP IT IN FRONT AND TWIST OVER
SO WE DROP OUR HANDS AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS FOLLOW THE UPPER HAND WITH OUR EYES AND ACTUALLY TURN OUR HEAD IN THE SAME DIRECTION
NOW WITH THIS TECHNIQUE YOU USE THE LEAD HAND TO BLOCK YOU ARE GOING TO BLOCK WITH THE LEFT HAND LIKE THIS SPIN THE WAIST OVER TO THE LEFT DROP THE RIGHT LEG DOWN AND FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE HOOK KICK
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS MAKING A SMALL OBJECT DISAPPEAR BY WAY OF THE FRENCH DROP
AND THEN YOU JUST DROP THIS RIGHT IN THERE GENTLY AND LET IT FALL UNTIL IT STOPS FALLING
YOU HAVE TO DROP DOWN TO THE FOURTH FRET
JUST A LITTLE BLACK AND GOLD DROP
NOW WE'VE GONE OVER WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IF YOU WERE TO TAKE THE HAND OF COURSE AND DO THE FAKE STEAL AND DROP AND PULL APART
WHEN YOU PRESS YOUR PALMS TOGETHER YOU WILL SEE IF YOU CAN AT THE SAME TIME DROP THE SHOULDERS AND WIDEN THE SPACE IN BETWEEN YOUR SHOULDER BLADES AND YOUR BACK
SO THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FISH FINDER SIMPLY TO TAKE YOUR JIG AND DROP IT DOWN THE HOLE
OKAY SOMETIMES IN SQUASH YOUR OPPONENT PUTS YOU UNDER A GREAT PRESSURE AND SO AS WE'VE SHOWN YOUR TRADITIONAL BACK HAND DROP SHOT WILL BE SOMEWHAT LIKE A MINI GROUND STROKE OR MINI VOLLEY IT'LL BE LIKE THAT
AFTER I PERFORM MY SIX TO EIGHT REPETITIONS I'M GOING TO DROP THE WEIGHT AND WITH THESE POWER BLOCKS I'LL ADJUST THE WEIGHT FIVE POUNDS DOWN ON EITHER SIDE
AND ONCE I REACH MY SIX TO EIGHT REPETITIONS WHICH IS ABOUT THE TIME I'LL FATIGUE OR HIT FAILURE THEN I DROP THE WEIGHT BRING THE WEIGHT DOWN ANOTHER FIVE POUNDS AND CONTINUE
DROP IT INTO ITUNES
IF YOU ENDED UP WITH A PIECE OF MUSIC AS AN MP3 OR IT WAS DUBBED OFF OF A DISC ANY OF THOSE TYPE OF THINGS ALL YOU DO IS SIMPLY LAUNCH IT FIND IT AND THEN GO AHEAD AND DRAG AND DROP IT

SHE SHOULD DROP WHAT SHE HAS IN HER MOUTH TO GET WHAT I HAVE

YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO KEEP A STRAIGHT LINE FROM THE CROWN OF YOUR HEAD THROUGH YOUR SITZ BONES SO COME INTO TABLE TOP AND COW HAPPENS WHEN YOU SPIN THE SITZ BONES UP TOWARD THE CEILING DROP THE BELLY AND GENTLY RAISE THE HEART
ALRIGHT SO NOW WE'VE LEARNED THE LIFT UP WITH OUR SECOND HAND LET'S LEARN HOW TO DROP THE HOOP DOWN WITH THE SECOND HAND
YOU'RE GOING TO DROP IT DOWN RIGHT BEHIND YOUR LEFT HIP THAT'S WHERE IT'S GOING TO CONNECT FIRST
WHEN THE HOOP PRESSES AGAINST THE PALM OF YOUR HAND THAT'S WHEN YOU CAN SLOWLY OR QUICKLY DROP THE HOOP DOWN TO YOUR WAIST
AND I LIKE TO START LOWER AND THEN WORK MY WAY UP BECAUSE SOMETIMES WITH THE HEAVIER BALL IF YOU DROP IT YOU CAN GET HURT
SO WE DROP THESE DOWN
WHEN WE'RE PREPPING THE WALLS AND WE'RE GETTING EVERYTHING DONE WE WANT TO GO AHEAD AND DROP OFF THIS AREA WELL
I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND LAY OUT MY DROP CLOTHS
YOU WANT THE CUT END OF YOUR MATERIAL TO DROP OFF OF ONE SIDE SO THAT WHEN YOU RUN THE SAW DOWN HERE IT WILL FALL OFF THE SIDE ON TO THE GROUND
ONE MORE TIME BEND THE KNEE PERFECT OPEN UP THAT HIP BY DROPPING IT OVER TO THE RIGHT LOVELY DROP THAT KNEE EXTEND THROUGH THE LEG AND THEN LOWER THE KNEE DOWN TO THE GROUND AND PRESS INTO CHILD'S POSE

NOW MAKING SURE THAT THE HIPS AND SHOULDERS ARE FACING OUT TO THE SIDES DROP YOUR ARMS DOWN TO YOUR SIDES AND WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH THE BREATH HERE
SO WHEN YOU'RE OUT HERE GUARDING YOUR MAN AND YOU GO ON HELP SIDE AGAIN YOU NEED TO STAY LOW DROP STEP AND KEEP THOSE GOOD WIDE STANCES UP OR SPRINT TO A PARTICULAR POINT TO TRY TO GET OVER AND STOP THIS GUY
NOW HOLD THEM UP YOUR SHOULDERS UP TO YOUR EARS UP TO YOUR EARS AND THEN LET THEM DROP
I CAN DROP THE TUBING DOWN IF I WANTED TO RIGHT
WHEN WORKING IN YOUR SHOP YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE COVERING YOUR FEET SO THAT YOU DON'T DROP ANYTHING ON IT AND INJURE YOURSELF
SO THIS IS CALLED THE DUMBBELL DROP SET
SO WHEN YOU DROP IN GO OVER ACROSS THE SPINE THEN COME DOWN PLACE YOUR TIRE JUST RIGHT WHEN YOUR READY TO JUMP AND GIVE IT A TRY
DON'T LET THE CHEST DROP TOO LOW KEEP IT LIFTED STRAIGHT FORWARD AND UP GOOD
FROM THE DROP DOWN MENU I CAN ALSO CHOOSE SIXTEEN BITS BUT I HAVE CHOSEN 32 BITS BECAUSE THIS IS A LCD MONITOR AND IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD WITH A LOT OF COLOR
I WOULD RECOMMEND KNOWING HOW TO DROP IN AND ALSO KNOWING HOW TO DO AN AXLE STALL
SO YOU'RE HOLDING HERE YOU PUSH OUT OFF TO ONE SIDE AND YOU'RE GOING TO DROP IN THIS WAY
AND YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUSH OUT TO THE SIDE LIKE THIS AND THEN DROP YOUR HAND TO THE INSIDE SO YOU HAVE THIS TWIST MOTION
SO ONE MORE TIME AND DROP THAT ELBOW STRAIGHT DOWN OVER THE PERSON O.K
I'M GOING TO STEP IN I'M GOING TO STRIKE DOWN TO THE NOSE STRAIGHT IN DROP MY BODY WEIGHT

AND DROP THAT IN
YOU DROP THE TAIL DOWN
DROP IT DOWN
OTHER SIDE SAME THING KEEPS IT THERE DROP YOUR HEAD AND BEND IT ONE MORE TIME
ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO DROP MY CENTER
SO YOU'RE GOING TO START WITH A WEIGHT THAT YOU CAN PERFORM ABOUT SIX TO EIGHT REPETITIONS WITH AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO PROGRESSIVELY DROP THE WEIGHT AND CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME NUMBER OF REPETITIONS
DROP SET IS DESIGNED TO COMPLETELY FATIGUE THE BICEP MUSCLE
HELLO MY NAME IS KYLE BRAYER AND YOUR LAST BICEP EXERCISE WILL BE THE DROP SET
YOU DROP IT INTO THE TANK YOU CENTER IT PUT DOWN THE NUT TIGHTEN HER DOWN
WE'LL WORK THE DROP SHOT AND HE COUNTER DROPS ME AND I HIT AN ANGLED SHOT
SO THEREFORE I COULDN'T REALLY CHANGE THE LETTERS ANYMORE AND THEN I CREATED A DROP SHADOW RIGHT HERE YOU SEE SO THAT WAY I CAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE DEPTH
THE ROCK IS FLAT I JUST ADDED A DROP SHADOW AND THEN ON THE STONE CARVINGS HERE I CREATED ANOTHER TWIST
DROP YOUR HANDLE DOWN PULL UP PUSH IN THERE YOU GO
SO IT HAS ENOUGH OIL IN IT AT THIS TIME BUT ONCE THE OIL FILTER FILLS UP THAT OIL LEVEL IS GOING TO DROP A LITTLE BIT
ALRIGHT SO YOU'RE GOING TO DROP YOUR HEELS RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT AND YOU'RE BENDING YOUR KNEES
DROP YOUR CENTER COME UP
FROM THERE YOU'RE GOING TO DROP IT LIKE IT'S HOT AND LINDA IS GOING TO DROP HER KNEES TO THE LEFT AND THE FRONT
I AM GOING TO DROP MINE TO THE RIGHT AND THE BACK AND OUR ARMS ARE GOING TO STRAIGHTEN AS WE DROP IT ALRIGHT
SO WE TAKE A LITTLE DROP OF FOOD COLORING FOOD COLORING IS VERY VERY CONCENTRATED EVEN WHEN YOU BUY SO IT IS GOOD TO DILUTE IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF WATER
IT'S A WIDER KIND OF DROP BECAUSE IT'S A NINE BY TWELVE
NOW THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF DROP
KEEP THEM IN LINE WITH YOUR SECOND AND THIRD TOES AND JUST DROP AND PUSH TOUCH AND GO
DROP DOWN A LITTLE BIT LOWER
SO THIS DRILL IS VERY VALUABLE TO PERFECT YOUR BACKHAND VOLLEY DROP AND YOUR BACKHAND DRIVE AND YOUR FOREHAND DROP AND YOUR FOREHAND DRIVE SO WORK IT EVERY TIME YOU PRACTICE AND YOU'LL SEE GREAT RESULTS
WE ALSO HAVE SPECIALTY TYPE SET-UPS WHERE WE HAVE HOOKS SWIVELS AND FLIES ATTACHED TO A LINE WITH AN EGG WEIGHT SINKER AN EGG DROP SINKER ON THE BOTTOM
DROP IT STRAIGHT DOWN
YOU GO DOWN AND YOU CLICK ON YOUR COLOR CORRECTOR THERE DROP AND DRAG IT ACROSS
IT FORCES ME TO PREPARE MY RACKET SO YOU SEE I HIT THE BALL I CAN'T HAVE THE RACKET JUST DROP DEAD
SO HERE IF WE'RE IN THE KEY E MINOR WE'D GO THIS IS 6DIMINISHED AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO JUST DROP THIS DOWN THAT'S V I RIGHT
ONCE YOU'VE DECIDED WHERE YOU WANT TO STICK GO AHEAD AND GET YOUR SAMPLE CARD OPEN AND HAVE THAT READY TO DROP THE BLOOD ON
YOUR HANDS CROSS OVER THE WRIST IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH IS ON TOP YOUR HANDS DROP DOWN TOWARD YOUR THIGHS LIFT UP NOW YOU'RE GOING TO BEND YOUR ELBOWS AND BRING YOUR FINGERS TO POINT TO ONE ANOTHER KEEPING ABOUT A ONE TO TWO INCH GAP IN BETWEEN LIKE YOU'RE BLOCKING THE SUN OUT OF YOUR EYES
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF ANY SHELTER IS TO CUT DOWN ON THE WIND BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT CAUSES THE CHILL THE WIND CHILL FACTOR TO DROP AS IT DOES
TAKE THE TIME TO PRACTICE EACH DAY AND IF YOU HIT YOURSELF AND IF YOU DROP YOUR POI IF YOU FEEL LIKE A TOTAL KLUTZ IT IS O'KAY
SO WHEN THE HOOP HITS YOUR PALM START TO TURN TO YOUR LEFT AND DROP THE HOOP DOWN TO YOUR WAIST
IF I DROP ITS NOT A PROBLEM I CONTINUE DOING MY FIVE THROWS AND THEN I CATCH UNTIL I CAN DO IT
YOU CAN ALWAYS DROP BACK TO A COMFORTABLE AND RELAXED BREATHING
EYE DROPPER OH I'M SORRY WE HAVE GOT TO BREAK IT FIRST SO WE BROKE IT EYE DROP IT AND FILL IT AND THERE YOU HAVE IT THAT'S HOW TO USE FILLS IN FLASH
ALSO YOU CAN TAKE IT TO THE FRONT AND DROP YOUR HEEL DOWN AND PULL AS WELL
AS WE MOVE AROUND HERE KIND OF AN AWKWARD ANGLE BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE BLADE IS TOTALLY STRAIGHT AND AS WE SLOW IT DOWN READY TO MEET WITH THE OTHER END JUST SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND THE PIECE SHOULD JUST DROP RIGHT OUT
WE'RE JUST SIMPLY GOING TO DROP THE DROPS IN AND COUNT
DROP THE WEIGHT STRAIGHT DOWN
DROP YOUR HEAD ALONG YOUR NECK AND BRING IT UP MOVING ON WITH THE NEXT ONE
AND IF I CAN DROP OVER THE BALL EVEN MORE THEN I'M GETTING MORE RANGE OF MOTION AND MORE INTENSITY ON THAT MUSCLE GROUP
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS LIKE WE'VE ALREADY GOT OUR DROP SHADOW HERE AND IT'S OF COURSE YOU CAN ALWAYS COME BACK THROUGH HERE AND CHANGE THESE OPTIONS WHENEVER YOU WANT TO
WE ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO BE BURNING MORE HIGH CALORIES AT A VERY HIGH RATE THEN IF WE WERE TO DROP IT DOWN TO ZERO INCLINE AND JUST HAVE IT AT A VERY SLOW PACE
O.K I'M ALREADY LOGGED IN ON MY MYSPACE PAGE SO I'M JUST GOING TO MAXIMIZE IT AND NOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO POST A BULLETIN IS UNDER FRIENDS AND IT'S A DROP DOWN MENU AND THEN GO DOWN TO BULLETINS AND CLICK ON THAT AND IT SHOWS THE BULLETINS THAT YOUR FRIENDS HAVE POSTED
WE ARE GOING TO REPEAT BETWEEN EIGHT AND FIFTEEN REPS YOU ARE EXHALING AS YOU PUSH UP AND INHALE AS YOU LOWER DOWN SO THINGS TO REALLY THINK ABOUT IS TO KEEP YOUR WRIST STRAIGHT TRY NOT TO LET THEM COCK TRY NOT TO LET YOUR ELBOWS DROP DOWN BELOW THE SHOULDERS KEEP THEM IN LINE WITH THE SHOULDERS AS YOU PUSH UP
SO AS YOU CAN SEE SHE BRINGS IT BACK SHE CLEARLY KNOWS IT'S A TOY DROP IT HEY DROP IT AND SHE'S VERY EXCITED
O.K THE FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS DROP A SUGAR CUBE IN OUR GLASS HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT ONE TO TWO DASHES OF BITTERS ON IT
AND IF YOU DROP WE JUST HAVE TO STAND AND CONTINUE
KEEP ON THE WAY YOUR HANDS ON THE FLOOR BRING YOUR BODY TO THE RIGHT SIDE BREATH AND RELAX DROP YOUR HEAD
SO WE CAN MAYBE PLACE A PORTAL ABOVE THAT ONE AND DROP A BLOCK ON IT IF WE CAN AIM THAT
SO MAKE SURE YOU'RE FLAT BASED YOU'RE LOOKING LOOKING LOOKING AND THEN WHEN YOU GET TO THE END YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO TURN DROP OFF STRAIGHT AND RIDE AWAY
WE NOW HAVE OUR SINGLE WHIP WE CAN STEP OUT AND DROP THE RIGHT HAND LIKE WE DID BEFORE
IF YOU WANT YOU CAN HAVE THIS PIECE OF FELT STANDING UP JUST A DROP TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE BORDER OF A REAL SET OF CURTAINS
LET GO DROP IT HERE TSUKI AND OFF THE LINE
IF I CATCH A FISH I'LL KNOW IMMEDIATELY DROP IT BACK TO THE BOTTOM BRING IT UP A COUPLE OF FEET
NOW A HANDY LITTLE THING IS THIS THAT I THINK I SAID BEFORE THAT THIS LITTLE PEN POINT IF YOU DROP IT YOU'LL MESS UP THE POINT AND IT'LL BEND LIKE THIS ONE HAPPENS TO BE BENT
SO START RIGHT HERE AS WE MOVE IN TOWARD THAT OPPONENT MALE A CIRCLE TIGHTEN THAT WRIST UP AND STRIKE I WANT TO DROP MY WHOLE BODY WEIGHT DOWN OVER THAT PERSON
ONE MORE TIME SLOW I'M GOING TO STEP IN MAKE A FULL CIRCLE AND CLOSE THAT HAND AND DROP MY BODY DOWN
SO WE HAVE A PERSON DOWN ON THE GROUND I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE FIRST JUST THE MOVEMENT YOU'RE GOING TO START WITH THE STAGGERED STANCE BOTH HANDS ARE UP NOW TO GENERATE POWER FOR THAT FOR THE STRIKE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THE HAND STRIKING IS GOING TO MAKE A CIRCLE THAT'S GOING TO CLOSE AND YOU'RE GOING TO DROP THAT BODY WEIGHT STRAIGHT DOWN ON YOUR TARGET
SO FROM HERE I'VE GOT HIM PINNED HERE AND IF HE STARTS TO GET AWAY I CAN TRANSITION INTO A STRIKE TO A HEAD GRAB TO A KNEE DROP ANYTHING THAT I NEED IS RIGHT HERE AT MY FEET
OKAY AT THIS POINT IT IS GOOD TO DO A LOT OF FLUFFING LIKE THIS TO DROP TO STRAIGHTEN OUT SOME OF THE MATERIAL
THEN WE WOULD PUT A PINCH OF SALT SO THAT IT WOULD KEEP THE GREEN COLOR OF THE GREEN BEANS AND WE WOULD DROP THE GREEN BEANS IN THE HOT WATER AND LET IT BOIL FOR FOUR FIVE MINUTES
BECAUSE THE TOP SECTION IS JUST A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN THE TWO SECTIONS THAT WE HAD IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD I CAN JUST COMPLETELY DROP THIS SECTION DOWN AND COMB THE HAIR IN ITS NATURAL FALL
