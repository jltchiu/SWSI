WE'LL TRY THE OTHER SIDE JUST SO THAT WE'RE SURE THAT WE WERE CLEAR IN OUR DEMONSTRATION
AT THAT POINT WE WANT TO COME BACK AND JUST CLEAR EACH OF THE RISERS
PRIMARILY WE'RE GOING TO CLEAR THE A LINES GOING TO THE FRONT OF THE WING HERE AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE CLEAN
SOME PEOPLE WILL DIP PIECES INTO A CLEAR GLAZE AND OTHER CHOOSE TO PAINT IT ON
I REALLY LIKE THE NON-ABRASIVENESS OF DIPPING BECAUSE REALLY YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING THE PIECES A WHOLE LOT AND WHEN YOU ARE PAINTING YOUR CLEAR GLAZE ON WHAT CAN HAPPEN IS AS SOON AS THE PIECE GETS WET YOU REACTIVATE THE PAINT AND WHEN A PAINT IS REACTIVATED IT'S VERY EASY FOR YOU TO START MOVING IT WHEN YOU ARE BRUSHING IT ON
SO HERE WE ARE IN THE BARRACKS WHICH IS OVERRUN WITH BRUTES AND WE'VE GOTTA FIND A WAY TO SAVE OUR GUYS AND CLEAR THESE BRUTES OUT OF THERE
AND A LOT OF THIS WILL BECOME CLEAR AS WE GO THROUGH THE SEQUENCES OF THE ACTUAL BEAD MAKING STEPS
TYPICALLY IT TAKES ABOUT TWO WEEKS AND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR WHEN YOU COME BACK TO THIS BEER IS GOING TO BE A NICE SEDIMENTATION LAYER ON THE BOTTOM AND CLEAR BEER ABOVE THAT
THEY NEED TO AFFECTIVELY BLEND THE ENSEMBLE IN RESPECT WITH THE MUSIC AND THEY NEED TO USE CLEAR CONDUCTING GESTURES
AND THEN PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR NOSE AND LET THE BACK WHEELS PICK UP PAST THE COPING AND CLEAR IT COMPLETELY AND THEN ROLL DOWN THE TRANSITION
BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IS BE ABLE TO PUT WEIGHT ON THE FRONT OF YOUR BOARD OR YOUR NOSE AND ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PURPOSEFULLY PICK UP THE BACK WHEELS AND CLEAR THE COPING AND BE ABLE TO ROLL BACK DOWN THE TRANSITION AND HAVE CONTROL
ON ORNAMENTS LIKE THESE THAT ARE THE CHARACTERS I USUALLY TAKE A BOWL OF SOAPY WATER AND ONE OF CLEAR
YOU CAN AGAIN CLEAR THIS OUT IF YOU WANTED TO RESTART
SO IN THE EVENT YOU NOTICE THAT YOUR TONER ISN'T PRINTING CORRECTLY AND YOU HAVE SOME LETTERS MISSING OR IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE GO AHEAD AND GIVE YOUR TONER A SHAKE BEFORE GOING AHEAD AND REPLACING UM GO AHEAD AND EXCUSE ME TRYING TO BUY A NEW ONE
BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO A CLEAR AREA THAT I CAN SEE QUITE CLEARLY
SO CHALK IS A WONDERFUL MEDIUM YOU MIGHT THINK IT'S VERY CHALKY BUT ONCE WE GET IN ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND IT BETTER YOU CAN ACTUALLY JUST TAKE YOUR FIXATIVE NOW IT'S A WORKABLE FIXATIVE AND CLEAR IT
HELLO MY NAME IS ADRIAN ARCEO AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BEING A CLEAR COMMUNICATOR
ALSO YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT AS A CLEAR COMMUNICATOR YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CONSISTENT WITH YOUR SIGNS
ONCE YOU CLEAR THE LIP LET GO OF YOUR BRAKE WHILE FEATHERING IT USING YOUR WEIGHT AS BALANCE MOVE IT ALL THE WAY BACK
MAKE SURE YOU MAKE EACH DOT CLEAR
BUT THAT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT YOU CAN SEE THE ACTUAL CLEAR BOTTLE
THIS ONE ACTUALLY HAS CLEAR LIQUID TOP AND BOTTOM
THEY'RE ALL CLEAR JUST LIKE THIS THE BOTTLE
BUT WHAT SCIENTISTS AND RESEARCHERS ARE PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT AT THIS POINT IS THAT CHRONIC STRESS JUST KIND OF HAS AN OVERALL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS
SO INSTEAD OF TAKING THOSE BLANK CHECK MARKS OUT OF THOSE FIELDS THE EASIEST THING TO DO BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE A FEW NAMES THAT WE WANT TO USE IS TO CLEAR ALL AND EVERYTHING WILL BE EMPTY AND IT WILL BE MUCH EASIER TO CHECK THE ONES THAT WE WANT INSTEAD OF GOING ALL THE WAY DOWN THE LIST AND UNCHECKING EVERYTHING
AND THAT'LL HELP THE IMAGE SHOW MUCH MORE CLEAR
I'D SAY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING NOW IS WHAT LENS COLOR YOU CHOOSE AND IF YOU BUY A PAIR OF GOGGLES I WOULD SAY GET THREE DIFFERENT COLORS AT LEAST CLEAR IS THE BEST FOR NIGHT AND WHEN IT IS REALLY SNOWING HARD BECAUSE THERE IS NO LIGHT REALLY AT THOSE TIMES
THE NEXT STEP IS TO DETERMINE THE NAIL LENGTH AND SOME NAILS ARE BLACK SOME NAILS ARE CLEAR WHICH MAKES IT A LITTLE EASIER TO IDENTIFY THE QUICK OR THE RED PART INSIDE THE NAIL
I THINK I'LL DO SOME MORESO ANOTHER METHOD THAT I DID WAS TO TAKE A PICTURE OF A STATUE IN A GARDEN AND THEN I COVERED THAT WITH CLEAR WAX AND IN THIS CASE I PUT DOWN SOME TISSUE PAPER AND THEN I SHOWED THE THREADS OF THE TISSUE PAPER THROUGH THE WAX AND COLORED ON TOP OF THAT SURFACE TO CREATE THIS EFFECT AND IT HAS AN INTERESTING TRANSITION FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH TO THE WAX COATING
I DIDN'T PUT CLEAR WAX DOWN FIRST JUST LIKE WITH RUBBER STAMPS BUT I GOT THIS IMAGE WHICH WAS THE FIRST ONE I TRIED AND IT BECAME VERY POPULAR
YOU WANT TO MAKE IT BE AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE FROM THE BEGINNING
SO REMEMBER THAT BEING A CLEAR COMMUNICATOR IS VERY IMPORTANT TO BEING A BASE COACH
SO IT'S CRITICAL TO TRY AND BACK LIGHT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET A PURE WHITE BACKGROUND.THE WAY OF DOING THAT I THINK THE BEST WAY OF DOING THAT IS A PIECE OF A CLEAR WHITE PLEXI-GLASS THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW THE LIGHT TO COME THROUGH AND GIVES YOU THAT WHITE BACKGROUND WITHOUT OVER-EXPOSING THE JEWELRY ITSELF
IT S A VERY CLEAR PIECE OF PLASTIC AND THIS IS GOING TO GO OVER THE PICTURE TO PROTECT IT
WE CAN USE IT TO SEPARATE THE TOP SO WE HAVE A CLEAR DEFINED EDGE
OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE MADE MY OWN GLOSS BY MIXING A CLEAR WITH A PINK OR A LIGHT PINK AND DARK PINK
SO IN THIS CASE RIGHT HERE WITH THIS BLUEBERRY PEACH WINE IT'S CLEAR IT'S NOT BUBBLING ANYMORE SO IT'S READY TO TAKE AND BOTTLE
AND THEN WE'LL CLEAR THE HIPS AT THE TOP TO GIVE THE BACK THE LOWER BACK A BREAK
THEY BOTH HAVE A FUZZY EFFECT ON THEM IF I HAD TO DO NON GLARE I WOULD PROBABLY DO A PLEXI OVER THE GLASS IT'S A LITTLE MORE CLEAR AND IT GIVES YOU A BETTER LOOK IN YOUR PICTURE
I CAN PUT THEM SIDE BY SIDE TO GIVE YOU A CLUE TO WHICH ONE IS MORE CLEAR
OK THIS WILL TAKE A WHILE TO TAKE EFFECT AND IN A COUPLE HOURS WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK HERE AND THIS PRESENTLY CLOUDY TANK IS GOING TO BE PRETTY MUCH CRYSTAL CLEAR
AND ON WE GO TO ENJOY OUR CLEAN HEALTHY SPARKLING CLEAR AQUARIUM
SO YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DRAG YOUR FOOT UP PUT PRESSURE ON THE NOSE POP OUT AND MAKE SURE YOUR WHEELS CLEAR THE TOP OF THE OBSTACLE
I DON'T WANT TO BE CLEAR OUT HERE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE CLEAR UP TIGHT TO HIM EITHER
START BY FINDING THE TOP EDGE OF THE SHEET AND JUST RUN YOUR HANDS ALONG THAT SO IT IS ALL CLEAR
WHEN YOU FIRST START UP A WINE IT'S BUBBLING REALLY FAST SO YOU WILL YOU WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR BECAUSE WHEN IT STOPS BUBBLING AND IT'S CLEAR AS YOU CAN SEE WITH THIS WINE HERE
YOU CAN SEE LIGHT GOING THROUGH IT AND VERY CLEAR
AND EACH OF THE COLOR COMBINATIONS IS INSIDE A CLEAR BOTTLE WHICH IS LIKE THIS ONE
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO LINE THE DOG UP FROM THE PREVIOUS AND POST OBSTACLES TO ENSURE THEY HAVE A CLEAR RUN THROUGH
AND WE'RE GOING TO USE A TWENTY GAUGE CLEAR VINYL FOR THE WINDOW
BUT IF I'M GOING TO SET IT UP AND CLEAN IT THEN I WANT TO ACTUALLY TAKE THIS AND WITH WARM SOAPY WATER PREFERABLY WITH THE O-RING OFF WASH THIS AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE PORTS ALONG THE BARREL SURFACE ARE CLEAN AND CLEAR OF PAINT DEBRIS
WHEN THEY'RE DEMONSTRATING THE RIGHT WAY HOW TO DO AN EXERCISE THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY MAKE IT CLEAR WITH THEIR CLIENT THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING BEFORE THE CLIENT GOES OUT THERE AND PERFORMS THE EXERCISE
IT'S CLEAR AND OPEN
YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THAT I WANT TO TRY TO GET THAT DOWN HERE AND CLEAR INTO HERE AS BEST I CAN TO GET THAT MEASUREMENT
AND YOU CAN GET A CLEAR STICK DEFINITION WITH THAT BUT WHEN YOU WANT TO CRASH I LIKE TO USE THE SHOULDER OF THE STICK
THAT NON GLARE INVITES LIGHTING WHICH DAMAGES YOUR PLEXIGLASS GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT CLEAR PICTURE THAN THE GLASS NON GLARE THOUGHT
SO YOU CAN JUST BRUSH IT OFF LIKE THAT AND THEN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR WORK SURFACE IS ALL CLEAR OF CRUMBS
NOW WHEN YOU HAVE THIS BUTTON RIGHT HERE WHEN YOU CLEAR IT IT'S GOING TO GET RID OF IT
YOU CAN ALSO CLEAR IT BY PRESSING THIS CLEAR PEAK SPOT BUTTON ON THE LEFT SIDE
ALTHOUGH THE PECTORAL FINS MAY APPEARED TO BE CLEAR
REALLY GIVE IT A SET WHEEL WITH SOME CLEAR CUT DEFINITION
THE GUY WHO WAS REPRESENTING IBM SAID JUST A MINUTE THERE'S ONE POINT I'M NOT CLEAR ABOUT
SO IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE'RE GOING TO BE USING BAKING SODA SALT AND CLEAR VINEGAR
YOU GIVE IT A REALLY REALLY GOOD SHAKE TO GET ALL THE EXCESS GLAZE OFF CAUSE YOU ONLY REALLY WANT A NICE THIN LAYER OF THE CLEAR GLAZE ONTO YOUR PIECE
NEXT I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO CLEAR GLAZE A BOWL
ANY GLUE THAT SQUEEZED THROUGH THE FELT AS YOU'RE PRESSING DOWN WILL DRY CLEAR IF YOU'RE USING A WHITE GLUE A REGULAR CRAFTS GLUE SO THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM
I WOULD ALSO STAND CLEAR OF BLACK TOP BECAUSE IT'S TOO PITTY BUT ONCE YOU HAVE THOSE THINGS SQUARED AWAY YOU'RE READY TO START BOUNCE JUGGLING
AND ONCE YOU ARE INTERVIEWED BY THE AGENCIES THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IS YOU MAKE THEM CLEAR WHAT YOUR GOALS ARE
THE OTHER THING IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T FEEL RIGHT REALIZE IS IF DOESN'T FIT PROPERLY THE CONTACT LENS MOVES AROUND WHICH HENCE BRINGS THE COLOR INTO YOUR LINE OF SIGHT SO YOU'RE NOT SEEING AS CLEARLY AS YOU WOULD WITH A CLEAR CONTACT LENS
IF YOUR PRESCRIPTION'S BAD ENOUGH MAYBE THE CLEAR CONTACT LENSES DON'T CUT IT SO THE COLOR ACTUALLY HELPS YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE THE CONTACT LENS IS IN RELATION TO YOUR EYE IT MAY BE EASIER TO PUT IN
A CLEAR CANVAS
YOU WANT TO PAINT IT ON SO THAT YOUR SKIN IS COMPLETELY SMOOTH AND CLEAR LIKE A WHITE PIECE OF PAPER BEFORE A PAINTER STARTS PAINTING
SO WE DON'T WANT TO BRING BACK A CARLOAD OR A TRAINLOAD OF FOOD SO WE'RE GOING TO CLEAR THAT OUT
WE HAVE FORKS SPOONS AND KNIVES IN EVERY COLOR ALONG WITH WHITE AND CLEAR
START OUT WITH SOME KIND OF CLEAR GLASS CONTAINER YOU CAN USE A SQUARE A ROUND ANYTHING THAT WILL HOLD THE AMOUNT OF UTENSILS YOU WILL BE USING
I AM JUST I REALLY LIKE WHEN I WORK ON SURROUND I LIKE USING A LIQUID A CLEAR LIQUID INSTEAD OF PASTE BECAUSE IT'S JUST EASIER TO WASH AWAY
LIKE IN THIS ROOM WE'VE CLEARED OUT MOST EVERYTHING SO THAT IF I FALL OR I SLIP OR TRIP I'M NOT GOING TO HIT MY HEAD ON A CORNER OF A COUCH OR I'M NOT GOING TO KNOCK A WHOLE BUNCH OF BOOKS OFF A SHELF OR ANYTHING EVERYTHING IS PRETTY CLEAR
AND I'LL WORK MY WAY THROUGH THAT AREA UNTIL THAT IS CLEARED AND THEN DO PART ON EACH SIDE OF THE LEG YOU KNOW I'LL CLEAR A SECTION HERE AND I WILL BE GOING TO A SECTION HERE
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS CLEAR AGAIN
AT THAT POINT I PUT IT IN NEUTRAL AND LET GIVE IT A QUICK JAB TO THE THROTTLE JUST TO CLEAR THE ENGINE OUT THEN YOU'LL HOLD DOWN YOU HAVE TO DO A RELEASE
AGAIN MAKE SURE EVERY THING IS CLEAR
NOW THAT SHE'S COMPLETELY CLEAR OF ALL COLOR IN HER SKIN WE CAN START WITH THE MAKEUP
BUT THE VINEGAR AND THE BAKING SODA IT WOULD ACTUALLY CREATE A FOAMING ACTION WHICH WE'LL GET DOWN THERE AND ACTUALLY GET OUT AROUND AND CLEAR UP THAT GUNK THAT ACTUALLY COATS THE INSIDE OF THE PIPE
SO ONCE THIS IS SET FOR TEN MINUTES THEN WE'LL SIMPLY POUR THE BOILING WATER DOWN AND THEN AFTER WE'VE DONE ALL THAT THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO JUST RUN THE HOT TAP WATER AND RUN THIS FOR ABOUT THREE TO FIVE MINUTES JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE HAD TIME TO CLEAR EVERYTHING OUT
TO START THE PROCESSING STAGE WE ENTER INTO THE CLEAR GLAZING
IT'S A NICE CLEAR COLOR
SO IT'S NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR RIGHT NOW
COME UP HERE AND CREATE A SURE-FIRE LIKE A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE ROBE AND THE LEDERHOSEN THE SOCKS
SO YOU WANT TO FIND A CLEAR COMFORTABLE SPOT TO PUT YOUR BINDING ON TO WHERE YOU CAN STAND UP FEEL COMFORTABLE BEING STRAPPED INTO YOUR SNOWBOARD
SO YOU HAVE SOMEONE INSIDE THE CAR PUSHING DOWN ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AND ONCE THEY HAVE THE BRAKE PEDAL DOWN ALL THE WAY THEY WILL SAY DOWN AND YOU WILL LOOSEN THIS LITER VALVE RIGHT HERE IN THE LOOSEN DIRECTION AND LIQUID WILL COME OUT AND IT IS GOOD TO HAVE A CATCH CAN FOR THAT TOO BECAUSE IT GETS IN ALL THIS PAINT AND IT WILL EAT THAT OR WHEN YOU ARE DONE JUST WIPE IT ALL OFF AND ONCE YOU HAVE HAD IT SO THAT NO MORE LIQUID IS COMING OUT YOU TIGHTEN IT BACK UP AND YOU TELL THEM TO LET IT BACK UP AND THEY PUSH IT DOWN AGAIN AND YOU REPEAT THAT AND YOU OPEN THIS AGAIN AND BLEED IT OUT AND PERIODICALLY MAKE SURE YOU ARE CHECKING THE MASTER CYLINDER WHICH IS WHAT WE HAD OPENED AT FIRST AND WE USED THE TURKEY BASTER FOR FOR TAKING OUT THE FLUID AND YOU KEEP DOING THIS STEP OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON THIS PARTICULAR WHEEL UNTIL YOU GET NEW CLEAR FLUID COMING OUT AND THIS ONE IS DONE AND YOU WILL REMOVE THE NEXT ONE IN THE BACK AND THEN DO THE FRONT ONES
IT CAN GIVE YOU A NICE CLEAR EDGE TO START WITH
BUT ALSO WHAT TYPE OF WEATHER YOU'RE GOING TO BE EXPECTING WHETHER IT'S CLOUDY OR HARSH CLEAR SKIES LIKE THIS WITH HARSH SUNLIGHT BECAUSE THAT WILL DICTATE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO BRING WHETHER IT MIGHT BE AN UMBRELLA OR REFLECTORS OR THINGS LIKE THAT
IN OTHER WORDS YOU HAVE THE KEY FACIAL FEATURES APPARENT AND CLEAR SUCH AS THE EYES EYEBROWS NOSE MOUTH CHIN AND SOME OF THE CREASES IN THE FACE AND THE FRECKLES AND SO FORTH
THE WAY THAT YOU WOULD OPEN AND CLEAR AND UNLOAD THIS GLOCK 31 WOULD BE YOU WOULD FIRST AND FOREMOST
AND IT MAKES THE SOUP CLEAR
THE OTHER THING INSTANT ANSWERS IN THE FORM OF PRODUCTS THAT WILL CLEAR YOUR WATER
SOMETHING THAT IS CLEAR DRYING
THAT GLUE'S GOING TO DRY CLEAR SO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF WE GET IT ON ANY OTHER PART OF OUR FISH
NOW YOU CAN GIVE THEM A CLEAR PRECISE TIME AS TO WHEN THEY'RE COMING UP
THIS DOESN'T LOOK VERY CLEAR IT ACTUALLY HAS A PURPLISH TINT TO IT AND THE REASON THAT IS DONE IS THE MANUFACTURERS ACTUALLY ADD A FOOD COLOR MINERAL INTO THE GLAZE AND IT ACTS AS A VISUAL GUIDE TO THE GLAZERS WHO NEED TO COVER AN IDEA PIECE INSURING EVERYTHING IS NICE AND SEALED WATERTIGHT AND OF COURSE FOOD SAFE
ALMOST ALL THE BLEEDER VALVES ARE AT THE TOP OF THE WHEEL OR THE BACKING PLATE OF THE WHEEL AND THEY ALL LOOK ABOUT THE SAME KIND OF LIKE A LITTLE HEX A SMALL SPOT AND A HOLE RIGHT THERE SO WHEN YOU LOOSEN IT USE A WRENCH SO YOU CAN SEE THE FLUID COMING OUT AND THAT WAY YOU CAN TELL WHEN THE NEW FLUID IS COMING IN ALL THE CLEAR THE NEW FLUID AND YOU CALL SEE WHEN ALL THE OLD STUFF IS FLUSHED OUT OF THE SYSTEM CLEANLY
SO WHENEVER ANYONE COMPLAINS ABOUT GAS IT'S ALWAYS A CLEAR SIGN THAT THEY'VE GOT TOO MUCH BAD BACTERIA IN THEIR SYSTEM AND IT'S TIME TO START CLEARING OUT THAT BACTERIA
YOU ARE GOING TO PULL UP NEXT TO THE CAR UNTIL YOUR REAR TIRES ARE PRETTY MUCH AT THE REAR OF THE CAR THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE PARKING BEHIND AND THEN YOU ARE GOING TO PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE TURN YOUR WHEELS AND SLOWLY START BACKING UP AND THEN ONCE YOU GET ABOUT HALF WAY BACK TOWARDS THE CURB AND YOUR FRONT TIRES ARE CLEAR OF THE CAR IN FRONT OF YOU THEN YOU ARE GOING TO START STEERING BACK THE OTHER WAY AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO JUST SLIDE RIGHT IN THERE AND BE RIGHT BEHIND THE CAR
