IF YOU ARE HAVING A COCKTAIL PARTY INVEST IN A BIG OLD BOTTLE OF LEMON JUICE OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE SQUEEZING LEMONS THE WHOLE PARTY AND YOU CAN'T HANG OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND GET IN TROUBLE
IF YOU HAVE POTHOLES OR ANY KIND OF TROUBLE WITH YOUR DRIVEWAY YOU MIGHT HAVE TO HIRE A DRIVEWAY PAVER
WE ALSO WANT TO WATCH FOR ANY SIGNS THAT SHE IS GETTING DISCHARGE FROM HER NOSE OR HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING
A BACKPACK TO CARRY IT ALL IN A GUIDEBOOK IS HANDY TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE DOING AND WATER IS GOOD TO HAVE A LONG AND I ALWAYS LIKE TO HAVE A LEAST A FEW BAND-AIDS IN A BAG SO THOSE LITTLE SCRAPES AND THINGS AND BRUISES CAN BE TAKEN CARE OF WITHOUT TOO MUCH TROUBLE AT THE CLIFF

IF IT'S HAVING TROUBLE IT'S GOT TO TURN UPSIDE DOWN AND LET IT SOAK
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO THROW THAT BALL UP IN AN ARK AND HAVE IT LAND IN THIS HAND WITHOUT THAT MUCH TROUBLE
JUST LIKE WITH BALLS IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE HIGHER NUMBERS THEN MOVE BACK TO THE ONE BEFORE AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE IT MASTERED WITH BOTH HANDS DOMINANT AND NON-DOMINANT
IF THEY ARE HAVING TROUBLE COMPLETING THEIR NORMAL DAILY ACTIVITIES VIA THEIR HOME THEIR WORK WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE WE START TO SEE A RETURN TO MORE NORMAL FUNCTION SO THAT DAILY ACTIVITY IS NOT SO MUCH OF A CHORE AND THERE IS NO LIMITATIONS TO DOING THOSE THINGS
