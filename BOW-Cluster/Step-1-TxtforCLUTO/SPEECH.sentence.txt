BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR SPEECH TO WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT YOUR STYLE STRUCTURING WRITING OR WHATEVER IT IS
I HAVE MADE A GREAT DECISION YOU'RE GOING TO INTERVIEW SOME LINE FOR PAPER OR SPEECH OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE NEED RESEARCH MATERIAL FOR
THOSE ARE THE THINGS IN YOUR SPEECH THAT YOU'RE IN ONE AGAIN EXTRA EMPHASIS OR EXTRA STRESS TO
IF THEY RELATE TO YOU OR TO SOMETHING IN YOUR SPEECH IT WILL BE MEMORABLE FOR THEM
BUT ONE OR THE THINGS WITH IN YOUR SPEECH BUT YOU CAN REALLY HIT FOR THE AUDIENCE TO RELATE TO
YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE MAKEUP ISN'T THAT MEN AND WOMEN ARE THE OLDER THE YOUNGER THEY IN THIS LORD SYNONYMOUSLY WORKS WITH A RELIGIOUS NOT RELIGIOUS WHENEVER IT IT IS AND THEN WHAT IN YOUR SPEECH IS GOING TO BE RELEVANT TO THEM WHAT CAN THEY RELATE TO
AND IF YOU HAVE ONE PRACTICE AND A SPEECH AND ENHANCEMENT FLOOR YOU HAVE TO <UNK> YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT IS OF FROM THEM LOAD IT USES
BECAUSE IT EVERYTHING THAT WE DO AND SAND COMMUNICATE VERBALIZES AND EXPRESSES ARE WORTH ARE SPEECH OUR ACTIONS ARE POSTURE EVERYTHING
NOW WHEN DEALING SPEECH SHOCK CITIZEN FOR AND CUT SOUNDS HAS SILLY BUT YOU DO ACTION IT WILL NOT WORK I
SOME THAT PEOPLE GREW UP LEARNING SPEECH AND FOCUSING ON SPEECH EVERY LIKE MYSELF
THIN SPEECH FAT
THERE'S THE SPEECH TO REDUCE JUMP FROM AN STAGE ONE RESTART FOR
IS IT UNSATISFYING SEX OF THE PHYSICAL ISSUES OR OTHER OTHER THINGS GOING ON THAT'S CREATING SOMEWHAT OF A CREATURE TRUST FOR THE SPEECH OF BEHAVIOR
ALRIGHT NOW TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT MIGHT HELP YOU HELP YOUR AUDIENCE TO REMEMBER YOU WORE A SPECIFIC HARVEST FEATURE MAY BE YOU KNOW WHEN AREA THAT'S REAL IMPORTANT IN YOUR SPEECH
AND THERE'S A LOT OF LITTLE THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY EXIST OR POSSIBLY SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD MAKE ENOUGH TO HELP YOUR AUDIENCE REMEMBER SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT YOUR SPEECH
IT ISN'T TEND TO RESIZE YOUR SPEECH BY WROTE AND WHAT THAT MEANS IT IS YOU'VE PRACTICED IT SO MINUS YOU SET IT IN THE SHOWER IN THE CAR IN USUALLY TO YOUR FRIENDS TO YOUR MOM TO EVERYBODY IN OF AND SO YOU'RE JUST GETTING IT OUT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT SO WELL THE AUDIENCE IS CAN BE AWARE OF THAT
WHAT IT'S AN A COME ACROSS LIKE IS THAT YOU HAVE MEMORIZED YOUR SPEECH
AND WHEN YOU'VE MEMORIZE TO SPEECH YOU ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT WORDS COME NEXT
ON TO GIVE THE ILLUSION OF I IN PERCEPTIBLE SPEECH IT CAN BE NO MOVEMENT
SPEED BOTH MORE DESIGNED FOR SPEED COMFORT RIGHT ON IT EAT A SIXTY MONARCH PLUS AN SPEECH WHERE OUR ONTO THE END OF THE MORE FOR LUNGING <UNK> ON IT OUT WHAT YET HOME GOING FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE ON
THERE ARE MANY OTHER THINGS THAT CAN BE USED IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING A SPEECH
BUT CERTAINLY THE USE OF THE HANDS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TO IN ORDER TO EMPHASIZE AND ALSO SOMETIMES IN ORDER TO POINTERS SELF INTO A CERTAIN DIRECTION IN THE SPEECH
AND NOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS THERE'S SO MUCH ANXIETY WHEN YOU'RE GIVING SPEECHES ANYWAY BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT WE WANTED DO AS A SPEECH GIVER OR REPRESENT OR IS COME ACROSS LIKE WE'RE TALKING TO THE AUDIENCE NOT HALF THE AUDIENCE
A SPEECH IS EVEN IF THEY'RE DONE IN A FORMAL SET A SHOULD NOT HAVE A FORMAL QUALITY TO THEM
