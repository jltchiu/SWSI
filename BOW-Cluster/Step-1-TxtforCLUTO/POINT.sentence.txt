A LITTLE AND ONCE YOU HAVE A REALLY LEAVES OF MAKE YOUR OF LIVING FIX CENTER AND IF A MODELING THIS UP READING THE MOVE INTO THAT HITTING MAKE THE OF AIR THE GIFT OF WOOD AND THE OF THE EDGE OF THE OTHER FOOT AND BE OF MONTHLY EARLIER OUT REALLY REALLY RUN INTO THAT LITTLE AT A BEAD OF VIEW OF THE OF GO IF YOU CAN LIVE IN THE F F OF LITTLE MOVEMENT COOK IT RIGHT LAYERS FOLLIARD RELIEVE THAT FOR YOU TO A POINT WHICH ARE THEN GOING AND THE MOVEMENT LACK OF LITTLE OF THAT WITH A OF A COUPLE NONE OF THE EVEN WITH RIP WITH LIVE DOWN AND YOU CAN CHECK IN FILLED WITH ENOUGH IN THERE AND READY FOR IT IN THE OTHER
MY NAME IS DAVE ANDREWS AND I'VE JUST SHOWED YOU HAD A USED CAR POINT IN LENGTH
HI MY NAME IS DAVE ANDREWS AND THEN WE'LL SAY HANI'S OUR POINT IN
THE BASIC RULES OF SPADES EVEN BE THE SAME AS ANY OTHER IN YOUR SPADES GAME IF YOU'RE PLAYING WITH A TIME LIMIT ROUNDS IN YOUR PLAYING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY POINTS PER ROUND WHICH LIVE A LOWER THAN USUAL SO MAKE SURE YOU ADJUST YOUR GAME ACCORDINGLY AND KNOW THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A HIGH POINT TOTAL VERY QUICKLY
IF IN THIRTY MINUTES THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY POINT TOTAL HAS NOT BEEN REACHED THE SEAM OF THE HIGH SCORES IN WHEN THAT ROUND
AND HERE FOR THINGS DELIBERATE TRICKY OR MAJOR RIP IT INTO DETAIL AT THAT POINT
IF YOUR CHILDREN OR OLD ENOUGH THAT THEY CAN WONDER OFF BY THEMSELVES AND ANY GIVEN POINT OUT YERGIN ONE I HAVE A PLANT IN THE BACK A PLAN IF THEY GET LOST AND SOME GUIDELINES IN RULES OF THAT IN HALF THE FOLLOW WHEN THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN
OR TO A POINT WHERE WE WANT TO ON CUP FOR THE PATCH
IF YOU DON'T SEE ALL OF THE ALREADY ON YOUR LIST HERE SELECT THE TWO LITTLE ARROWS POINT TO THE RIGHT MIND ALTHOUGH FEEL AS YOU CAN SEE MY DAY PROFILE SHOWING UP RIGHT THERE
NOW AT THIS POINT OUR LEFT HAND OAKLAND'S AND COME OVER HEAD PALM LOCKING NOW SHOULDN'T TURN HER TORSO THIS WAY USING THE HAND
AT THIS POINT THE RIGHT HAND IS IN A FIRE OUT OF THE BEGINNING OF THE TIME WHEN A INCH IN FULL LORTON OUT
YOU CAN EVEN GO BACK AS FAR AS AN TEETH FOUR POINT OIL AS YOUR FROM FOR AS YOUR COMPATIBILITY VERSION ALLOWING YOU TO GET SOME REALLY OLD CRANKY APPLICATIONS THE RUN UNDER VEST
HOWEVER I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT TODAY THAT YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO BE SO CONCERN ESPECIALLY IN THE BACKYARD GARDEN
WE ARE THEN GOING AND DO THE FINISHING PRESSING ON A HAND AT THAT POINT I WILL TAKE THE TWO GARMENTS AND THEY ARE HANGING YOU
SO THE WAY YOU CAN DO THIS POINT IS AN OF GOLD IN ANY PARTS THAT ARE HANGING OUT OF THE END THAT YOU MAY WANT TO BRING BACK INTO A BUBBLE WRAP ROLL
LET'S LET'S OPEN UP MY RESULT OUR POINT IT BY CLICKING ON THE START BUTTON GOING ALL PROGRAMS IN A MICROSOFT OFFICE <UNK> WHICH IS LOCKED POWERFUL
THE POINT IS TO KEEP THEM STRAIGHT AHEAD WE'RE IN AND DO ONE
IF YOU HAVE HEAVIER DEVICES WE ACTUALLY HAVE A SCREW IN ANCHOR LIKE IS THIS OR JUST A STANDARD ANCHOR WHERE YOUR DRILL A HOLE AND THEN YOU WOULD USE A SCREW INJURED CATCH POINT
AND THERE ARE SEVERAL HANGERS THAT WE CAN USE A I'LL TALK ABOUT THIS POINT
IF IT DOES IT IN ONE THING CAN POINT AND HOLLOWS DIRECTLY INTO THE CENTER OF YOUR DRAIN MARKET
IF AT THAT POINT WE WANT COME BACK AND JUST CLEAR HALF EACH OF THE RISERS
AND DOWN TO A POINT DOWN TO ABOUT AND A LOT ANY THEIR PATTERN IN LIKE TO CHOOSE USES
YOU CAN DO ALL KINDS OF OBSCURE ITEMS AND THIS HAS EVERYTHING A POINT VALUE AND SEE WHAT KIND OF WEIRD THINGS PEOPLE REALLY HAVE THEIR PURSE
ANYTHING IN DAY EIGHTEEN E A D APPOINTED POINT ROOT VARIATIONS THEY'VE SEEN VEHICLES ONE OF THE STAR AND ONE OF THE BOTTOM
AND AS A PRETTY BIG POINTS OF POINT BATH ACCURATE WHICH A TAKE ONCE
OKAY THE NEXT LEVEL WHEN IT'S ALL ABOUT SCORING OR YOUR POINT SO YOUR BOWLS THING TO MOVE FORWARD SO EVENTUALLY SINK THE EIGHT OHM AND AGAIN
I THINK WE CAN GO BEYOND THIS POINT
THE POINT OF THIS IS LIKE I SAID BEFORE IT'S GOING TO MAJOR I THINK THAT IT'S RECESSING THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY EXIST AS CLOSE TO THE SURFACE AS IT REALLY DOES AND IF YOU PUT A LITTLE HIGHLIGHT IN THE CENTER OF THE FACE THAT'LL BRING THE CENTER OUT AND THE EDGES BACK TO YOUR FACE WITH US WITH A LITTLE THINNER THAN IT REALLY IS
AND IT'S ALRIGHT IF IT DOESN'T FULLY CLOSE AT THIS POINT IS WE'RE GOING TO ADJUST THE TENSION IN AND A LITTLE BIT
AND THEN AT THIS POINT AND THE SKIN OF RUN MY FINGERS FAIRWAY IMMEDIATE IS NANCY IN IS TEXTURED AND THEY'RE POSSIBLY CAN
SO YOU HAVE YOU END UP WITH TWO BALL SOMEWHAT YOU CAN GET KIND OF WEIGHT AND IT'S NOT AN A BODY IS DOING THE POINT
TRY NOT TO HAVE BEEN ON THE FLOW IT DOES IT THERE ON THE FLOOR AND USE THAT YOU POINT AND THEN YOU WAIT YOU MICE THAT ONE MANNA HURT YOURSELF
SO NICE GOOD STRETCHES TOUGH DISPLAYS OR FEET YOUR ABOUT SHOULDER WIDTH APART FIFTH AND DON'T HUNDRED TOES POINTING OUT OR DON'T HAVE AN POINT IN IT
THEN AT THAT POINT THEY WOULD MAYBE MADE INTO THE CRACKER AND THEREFORE THAT WOULD BE CALLED A LIVE RAWL CRACKER
THEY WERE SOAK FOR THE DESIGNATED TIMES THAT THEY WOULD COME TO THE POINT SPROUTS
THE MOSQUITO GUARD WILL KILL THE CREST AND CRACK OR AND BY DOING ONE POINT OF FIRST WRITE AN INCH
IF IT'S STERLING SILVER IT'S GOING TO BE STAMPED OF POINT NINE TO FIVE STERLING SILVER
THE POINT IS IS TO HAVE A PLACE CLEAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO DO RENOVATIONS THIS MAKE SURE ITS PROPER
AND THE WHITE TO THE POINT
AIM TO CHANGE A SPHERE SAYS FIT ON A MUCH DIFFERENT HERE TO THIS POINT AS HEAVY TURKEY CARCASS IF AN A
AT THIS POINT YOUR THIGHS ONE TWO EARTH TOUCHING
WHICH YOU WOULD DO IS HAVE A ENDS IN A THINNER SPREAD APART POINT OF ALL OF THE LEFT HAND GUIDING THE WHOLE THING SO IT'S LIKE INTO IT ON A HOME
UNTIL YOU GET INTO THAT POINT YOU GOTTA DO A LOT OF HELPING ELATA SHOWING SO THAT THE DOG CAN MAKE A DECISION ON IS ON AND THAT'S HOW YOU TRAIN A DOG HOW TO USE THE DOG A DOOR
ONCE HE NEXT IT'S OR THE OTHER SIDE AT THAT POINT IS VERY CRITICAL THAT YOU REALLY MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD ABOUT HIS VICTORY
YOU COULD ALSO TAKE THAT SHIMMERY COLOR AT THIS POINT CYNTHIA'S ALMOST DONE AND TAKE IT A LITTLE BIT UNDER THE BROW TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE OF A SPARKLE
USE THE EDGE OF THE WEAPON LOWER THAT TO HAVE TO SCORE POINT
SLOWLY WITH A NEW IS GOING IN A THREE POINT STANCE AND THE FIRST PART OF THIS IS ONE OF FIRE OUT AND FIT IN THE NUMBERS AND JUST GO THAT FAR SET UP A GOOD
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT A LOT OF BEGINNING PLAYERS DO THAT REALLY IS NOT PROPER IS PUTTING THE CUE BALL TOO FAR BACK WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TO LIFT THIS IS TO TRAVEL FROM THAT POINT UP TO THERE
I THINK I'VE MADE MY POINT
SO THE BECAUSE THE POINT IS IS DON'T BE SCARED OFFER DON'T BE DETERRENT FOR MAYBE TRY TO GET INTO THIS BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ELECTRONICS
SO COLOR CORRECTIONS COULD BE A REAL VITAL POINT FOR PEOPLE WHO REALLY ONE OCTAVE FILMS OPEN SPECIAL
TAKE MY THREE MILLIMETER WRENCH OR TO TO POINT FIVE MILLIMETER WRENCH FOR USING THE OBI BRAND GRIPS
SAME THING ON THE SIDE FROM THE TOP POINT TO THIS POINT FOLD IT DOWN
AND THIS POINT TO THE TOP POINT FLOAT IT DOWN
AND THIS IS THE A MATTER FEEL AT THIS POINT GIVEN ONE ABOUT HALF AN INCH OF OF CLAY DEPENDING ON HOW BIG YOU WANT TO FILL IT AT THE BOTTOM OF OF OF YOUR POT
SAME THING ON THIS SIDE MAKING SURE THE POINTS MEAT POINT
POINT TO THE CENTER THE CREASES PARALLEL TO THE CENTER CREASE
NOW WE ARE GOING TO FOLD THIS POINT INTO THE CENTER BUT PARALLEL THE CREASE WILL BE PARALLEL TO THE CENTER LIKE THIS
INSIDE THE LETTERS FOLD THAT POINT AND IT'S MADE AND SAME THING ON THIS SIDE INSIDE REVERSE FOLD THAT POINT
AND WHAT I'VE GOT HERE IS A <UNK> OF CANNON THIRTY FIVE MILLIMETER IF ONE POINT FOR A APERTURE FIXED FOCAL LENGTH DOUBLE WINS
THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT AND I DON'T SUGGEST THAT YOU PRACTICE IT TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE READY TO JUGGLE SIX VOLT BEFORE TRYING THIS TRICK BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO AT LEAST FEEL THE FLASH THE WALLS AND ONE HAND TO REALLY DO THIS
SO WHERE WE HAVE THE EASE IT WITH CURTAINS HOME GET A COUPLE INCHES ABOUT THREE INCHES OVER THE WINDOW UP IF YOU WANT MY RULE OF TALLER FLEA ACTUALLY COME UP THROUGH THE POINT THAT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE CROWN IN THE TOP OF THE WINDOW
WITH CALF RAISES WE WON'T WORK FEEDING OR PART BELOW THE KNEE INTO THE ACHILLES THAT POINT ADVANCEMENT TO THE HEEL
IT'LL BE HITTING THE HIGH POINT IS A WHICH AGAIN WHEN I DO IT AGAIN AND WHEN I GO ALONG WHEREVER THE HIGH POINTS ARE IS THE COLOR THOSE THEN TO AND THAT WILL YOU KNOW BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE TAKE OFF FROM <UNK>
HOWEVER OF THE OTHER TEAM'S SERVES AND WE HIT IT OUT OR THEY HAD AN ARE SQUARE THEY GET THE POINT
SO IT MIGHT SEEM OR TO SERVE THE BALL AND WE GET AN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE QUARTZ WE GET IN THE SQUARE IN THE ON THE GROUND WE GET A POINT
AM WITH WHEN USING THIS TYPE OF SCORING AND THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A POINT IS WHEN YOU SERVE THE BALL
THE ONLY WAY IN TRADITIONAL INSIDE OUT SCORING EVEN GET A POINT IS IF YOU SERVE THE BALL
BUT IF IN WHEN IT COMES TO THE POINT THAT YOU ACTUALLY NEED A RESTRAINING ORDER MANY MANY TIMES INDIVIDUALS IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT CAN ASSIST YOU ARE DIRECT YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO GO TO FILE FOR RESTRAINING OR
AND THIS POINT IN HIS CAN DO THE SAME THING THAT I WAS DOING ON THE UPPER LIP ON THE LOWER IT LOWER LIP AREA AND ON THE CHIN TRYING REFINE AND A LITTLE BIT BETTER
INSTEAD WHICH YOU HAVE IS THE IDEA AND WITH THE ONE PRESENT THE WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU ARE DOCUMENTING EITHER BE AN INDIVIDUAL OR AN EVENT THAT HAPPEN AT ONE POINT WHEN OR ANOTHER OR ISSUE
THAT IS A POINT WENCH NICE WIRE TOOL AND THEN VANLANEN AND MOVE IT OVER THE LAST
THE SECOND THING TO DO TO SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION FROM HUMAN PHYSICIAN ON BECAUSE LIKE I SAID THESE BITES CAN BECOME VERY VERY INFECTED AM AND LITERALLY TURN VERY BAD AND TO THE POINT WE CAN ACTUALLY REQUIRE SURGERY
ALL YOU HAVE ONE ON THE TACOS USE THAT HAVEN'T BEEN YOUR TOES TOGETHER AND POINT THEM UP A DORSI PLANT THEM
AND AT THIS POINT RULE AND AGAIN USE OUR SLIP STITCH
SO OUT WE PUNCH SO WE CAN HAVE IT RAIL START IN A PLACE AND SET IT IS NOW I'M TRYING TO THROW IT IN THAT WITH NO OF FOCAL POINT A ROOT NOTE OF FIRST POINT
NOW UP TO THIS POINT WE LOOK THAT HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN CLAY BODY BASED ON HIGHLY PROCESSED INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS BUT BECAUSE CLAY IS A NATURALLY OCCURRING SUBSTANCE NEW EXIST RIGHT IN AND IN THE GROUND WE CAN ON BIG ABOUT A BROWN IN USE THAT AS IS
AND THE E STRING HAS NO THE STRING TO REST LASTLY THIS CAN HAVE TO AN CAPTURE SELF WHEN YOU GET TO THAT POINT
IF YOU DO THE OF A CUP OF THE NEW ONE ENTER IN WITH THE LONG POINT OF THE SKEW IF REST LITTLE DOWN AND AGAIN IF KEEP IT UP HIGH F EFFECT WHEN LOOKING AT RUB AGAINST THE WALL IF IT IS I FEEL
IF YOU CAN'T CONTIBEL WITHOUT LITTLE HOLE WHICH IS A BEAD STOPPING POINT FOR A LIGHTHOUSE A CONCERN EVEN A LITTLE BIGGER WILL BAKER LIMITER LITTLE THE HAIR IN BASICALLY THE IDEA IS YOU CAN EVEN USE A LITTLE ON THE HARDWARE STORE IT YOU CAN USE TO TO LINE AND SETTLES ALLITERATIVE ALRIGHT THROUGH ON THAT AND THE BIGGER AND BIGGER THE GOAL IS TO GET IT IN A JUST A LITTLE OR IN THE OUTSIDE AND THERE'S NO LEARN ALL
AND GET IT TO THE POINT OF GENTLY IN IT IN HALF SELF
WAS IT STEP WHITE STOP HOLD FOR THIRTY SECONDS IF HE'S OFF OF IT AND GO BACK AGAIN STRAPS UNTIL YOU KNOW IF IT'S THAT POINT WE CAN WITHSTAND VIA THE PAIN THE SCENE ANSWERS STRETCHING
THERE'S THE CALL BODY GLIDE AND ANY OTHER KIND OF OS SLIPPERY OILY SUBSTANCE THE CAN PUT ON A CHIEF POINT THAT SIMPLY PUTTING A LITTLE BIT OF ODD OF VASELINE OR PETROLEUM JELLY UNDERNEATH YOUR ARMPITS ON YOUR INNER THIGHS CRAPS ON YOUR TOES OR AROUND YOUR NECK ARGUED POINTS TO PREVENT CHAFING
ANY CAN ACHIEVE POINT WHERE I THE CLOTHING DOESN'T FIT EXACTLY RIGHT SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING
RALLY SCORING IS WHERE EVER SERVE AS A POINT
IF THIS IS A SIMPLE TECHNIQUE THAT OFTEN REFERRED TO AS A STALL AND IT'S ESSENTIALLY DOES STOPPING YOUR POI IN MID AIR REALLY REACH THE FARTHEST POINT AWAY FROM YOU AND REVERSING THEIR DIRECTION
A LOT OF THESE LARGER MEANS LATER ON POINT ON LENGTH AND THEN YOU CAN NARROW IT DOWN
CASE IN POINT ON MY PICTURE I ONLY HAD A CRACK SITTING OVER HERE ON THE LOWER PART
YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT IN TIME HOOK UP ALMOST I'M GOING TO INCUR SOME TYPE OF MEDICAL PROBLEM OR MINOR INJURY
AT THIS POINT WILL COME IN HANDY WHEN YOU GET INTO THOSE TIGHT QUARTERS
CLICK ITSELF INTO A TREE OR ALL THE OR SOMETHING SOLID SO THAT YOU CAN USE IT AS A BELAY POINT OF THE SHOW AND THAT WAY NO MATTER HOW MUCH TENSIONS ON THAT WROTE YOU GOTTA BE ABLE TO LEAN AGAINST THE BALL WILL THE CHERRY USING THAT LIP LINE AND IS NOT GONNA GO ANYWHERE
IF THAT POINT SKIRT OR SHOULDERS PERIPHERAL AND TAKE A NICE THAT HALF
WE HAVE TO POINT OUT ALMOST EVERY LITTLE DETAIL THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED BUT WE DON'T DO IT ALL THAT ONCE IT'S A LITTLE BIT HERE IN NEAR WE JUST SPRINKLE EVERY BOOK WITH JUST A LITTLE BIT AND HELPS
BASICALLY IF YOU CLICK AND DRAG IT THE DRIED OUT TO THE SIDE DEPENDING ON HOW FALL FROM THE ORIGINAL POINT THESE HANDLES ALL WILL DEPEND ON HOW WHY EAT YOU OFF HIS CAN BE
SO IF YOU JUST REMEMBER THAT SIMPLE POINT
WIDGET OBSERVE IT AGAIN AND THE OVERLAP POINT RIGHT TOE AND COME BACK INTO THE BASIC
THE DEADLY CANNOT LIFT THE BALL UP AT ANY POINT TIME
I MEAN CHANCES ARE THE OPPONENTS ON DON'T WHETHER THIS BUILT DOES BID WOULD BE SET WITH HIS ACES THAT ONE A POINT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE KING QUEEN JACK CAN OR SOMETHING OF THAT OLD
SO YOU DECIDE TO PRINT OUT WITH SOME WHEN YOU DO IS TO DO IT QUICKLY WHICH EMOTIONALLY TO THE COLD AND TO THE POINT
AN ICON EDGES USED THE WIND OVER HERE TO AS A REFERENCE POINT TO THE WIND IS COMING IN FROM HERE SO I LIKE MY HIGHLIGHT TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROOM
IF YOU CAN FIND THAT PARTICULAR POINT IF IT'S IN REALLY REALLY GOOD ONE
BASICALLY THE CHILD'S POINTS WITH THEIR PENCIL AND COUNTS AS THEY POINT AND THEN THEY WRITE THE NUMBER IN IN PENCIL
YOUR INNINGS YOU GET THE STOCKPILES AND THEN IN THE MIDDLE TO YOU ARE A POINT WHERE YOU COULD USE OR STOCK PILE
YOU ALSO DO A DRY I AFTER OR SOMEONE SCORED POINT TO READ A ZOOM THE GAME AND YOU DO IT I IN THE BEGINNING OF THE HALF TWO
AND IN THE LAST STEP I SHOWED YOU HOW TO GRIND YOUR ART GLASS TO ADD FIT TO THE SIDES YOUR PATTERN A FILL A PAPER PATTERN ON FOR THIS POINT
AT THAT POINT YOU'RE PROBABLY IN ONE GO SEE YOUR PIERCER AND HAVE ADJUSTED SO IF IT'S A LOT MORE TIGHTLY
THAT GIVES THE POINT WE REALLY ONCE THE OUTSIDE OF THE RED IN YOUR HOUSE AND RATHER HAVE THE CLOTH AND YOU CAN READ TO YOUR HOUSE AND INSIDE <UNK>
AND WITH A THIN LINE IS OUT POINT MY TOES
AND A HALF A YOU KNOW YOU CAN CHECK THE TIME TO LOVE THIS POINT
SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU SEE COUNSELING MARRIAGE COUNSELING AT THIS POINT BECAUSE IT IS TO STOP THE THE THE PAIN AT THAT POINT OUT A PROFESSIONAL PERSON CAN HELP UNDERSTAND HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE CHEATING
THIS PARTICULAR ONE YOU NEED TO POINT IN FULL SUN AND IT TAKES ABOUT EIGHTY DAYS TO MATURE THE
IN THE ACTUALLY TAKING A WHILE TO GET A CAT ON FOR IT FROM THE POINT OF THEIR DOWN ON THE FLOOR USING LITTER BOX TO WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY UP ON TOP OF THE TOILET USING LITTER BOX
EVERYONE BE ASKED ME VENTED OF AT SOME POINT OR ANOTHER
IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU WERE AND SHOOTING SOMEBODY SNARE POINT LIGHT DIRECTLY AT <UNK>
AS A SINGLE LIGHTING THAT IS POINT UP AT THE CEILING END THAT DIFFUSE THAT LIGHT BECAUSE CEILINGS WHITE AND GIVES IT A NICE GLOW
THAT'S WHERE OF ANOTHER TYPE OF MASK ON LIKE THE LAUGHING GASES PUT ON THE PATIENT AND THEY ARE BASICALLY PUT COMPLETELY ON OR TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WILL NOT FILL IN A THING THEY CAN HEAR ANYTHING
ONCE AGAIN IF YOU DO NOT HAVE MANNA BY THIS POINT YOU CAN MULLIGAN AS MANY TIMES TO GET THAT
START WITH SOME GENTLE LEFLORE EYES YOU CAN WORK INTO SOME D FOR KETCHERSIDE AT THIS POINT
AND THAT ENTAILS AS HAVING A SMALL BOBBER ON YOUR LINE THAT YOU PUT IT THE POINT WHERE YOU WANT TO FISH AT
ONE YOU CAN TIE A VERY SIMPLE SLIP KNOT AND JUST THREW REALLY ARE LINED UP TO THAT POINT
ANYONE NICE AN ARCHED AND THEN WHEN YOU GET THAT POINT YOU GO DOWN
AND WHERE THE I GROW FINISHES AT THE HIGH POINT WHICH IS RIGHT HERE YOU WANT PROBABLY THE SMALLEST AMOUNT AND PUT ON
WHO HAVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE HERE OR A THUMB VITAMIN UNDER CAN WE ALL FENDI ALTERNATING ANTI ANGLES AGAIN PIECED HERE HERE AND HERE WE GIVE IT KIND OF A FOCAL POINT HIM AND METAL
THE NEW ANYTHING AT THAT POINT BUT RIGHT NOW THAT CAUSE FINISH TUNA INTO A CONVECTION BURNISH
ON THE NEXT POINT READ HALF THE FOLLOW IS TO CREATE A CONTRAST THING VOICE FOR YOUR CHARACTER
OKAY SO WE'RE JUST ABOUT A THING TO THE POINT WHERE STEVE FILLS THAT HE'S WARM HIMSELF OF ADEQUATELY
WITH AN VIDEO BUT THE <UNK> WOULD READ THE WHOLE THING OR POINT A MOCK THIN IN WATER THE HIP THEIR FULL <UNK> ON
THIS IS A POINT WHERE YOU NEED TO ALSO BE SURE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY WATER FALLING OUT OF THE SHAFT GIVE LATCH
HI SO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A COMPLETELY FOLLOW AROUND HAS IF IT WERE GOING HALF COMPLETELY ALONG WITH THE CIRCULAR DIAGRAMS I THINK YOU CAN SEE MY POINT BEST IN THIS LITTLE ON THIS'LL DIAGRAM
THIS IS ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX AND SO ON ALL THE WAY UP HERE TO POINT TWENTY FOUR
AS YOU GO AROUND AND POINT THIRTEEN HUMAN IS SET UP FIVE
IN POINTS TWENTY FOR YOU TO SET UP TO IN THE TWENTY FEET IN TWENTY IN POINT TWENTY FOUR
OVER HERE IN POINT EIGHT IT IN A SET OF THREE PIECES HIM POINT SIX YOU'RE A SET OF FIVE
GREEN IS ALSO THE MID POINT IN THE SHOCK OR ITS OWN BETWEEN THE LOWER CHOKERS AND THE UPPER SHOCK RINSE
WHEN HE DOES HELP KIND OF POINT AND WE DON'T PLOT EFFORT INTO IT AT ALL
THE BALL DOWN FIGHT POINT ZERO FIVE POINT FIVE INSTANCE
USUALLY THERE'S A A LITTLE POINT HERE THAT'S BEEN MADE ON YOUR TROUSERS
I JUST GONNA MENTION AT THIS POINT THAT ON CANCER SURVIVOR ON A TWELVE YOUR CANCER SURVIVOR AND MIGHT HELP PEOPLE THAT IT WOULD GET AN IN INCHES THE LEAF
YOU'LL BE ON THE MICROPHONE SINGING A SCRATCH VOCAL WHICH JUST GIVES THEM A POINT OF REFERENCE FOR WHERE THE MELODY FALLS RHYTHMICALLY AND ALSO WHAT PART OF THE SONG THAT THE RAMP
TAKE YOUR THUMB YOUR THUMBS THE PIVOT POINT
TAKE IT AND POINT IT STRAIGHT DOWN LIKE SO
ANYTHING THAT'S NOT A LAND IS AT SOME POINT A SPELL EVEN IF IT BECOMES SOMETHING ELSE AFTER
NOW AT THIS POINT IF YOU WANT IT PUSH THE FLOWER <UNK> YOU DON'T HAVE SO MUCH SKIN OR YOU CAN GRASS THE SKEWER TIGHTLY AND JUST PUSH IT UP
YOU DON'T WANT AND TIDY GETS ON EACH FENDER WHERE THE HIGH POINT IS OR WHERE PARTICULAR BODY LINE IF YOU JUST WANT A MEASURE OF A STRAIGHT LINE THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE WHEEL AND HE'S IN A RECORD THAT ON PIECE OF PAPER FOR EACH CORNER OFF AND SEE HOW THEY COMPARE
THIS IS HOW WE FINISH ON POINT ONE
YOU CAN EASILY ACCOMPLISH THIS LIKE A SET OF ICON INTO OUR POINT AND LOOKING OVER THE LANDSCAPE
THAT WAS THE SMOOTHEST EVER BUT YOU GET THE YOU THE POINT
MAKES ACTUALLY PAINFUL INSIGHT LOTS OF DRAMA TIGHTENING VITAL POINT DEFENSE WE CAN USE FOR WOMEN'S SELF DEFENSE DEALS WITH THE UNDERARMS THERE WITH THE UNDERARMS
THE IT YOU CAN HOLD THIS FOR SAY FIVE TO TEN BREAST JUST THAT GENTLE GENDER GENTLE PRESSURE MAKING AWARE OF YOUR CENTER POINT MAKING AWARE OF HIS POWER IN YOUR ARMS AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE EXHALE TO RELEASE JUST LAY FAULTING
WHEN DOING NOW IS MEASURING THE LAST POINT OF CARTON
OKAY THAT POINT AND IT JUST HAS HERE IN THE SWITCH <UNK> TO FOLLOW
I BEGAN BUILDING FROM THE CENTER POINT OF MY AREA AND I'VE DESIGN MY CONE SHAPE IT'S BEEN A BEAD ESSENTIAL PART OF THE SAND CASTLE
BUT THIS IS A POINT WHERE WE FEEL THAT WORK COMFORTABLE WITH THIS PERSON
LOOKS LIKE I SET MY FEET RIGHT IS BY GUESSING THERE AND I LIKE TO RUN A SEVENTY THREE AND A QUARTER OF SEVEN THREE POINT TO FIVE MILLIMETER SEAT HEIGHT AND THAT'S THE THAT WE GOT
NOW TO WORK ON THIS YOU HAVE TO GET THIS CATCH DOWN A YOU'D HAVE TO BE USED TO KICK YOUR LEG UP AND CATCHING THE UP UNDERSIDE OF THE CRYSTAL STICK ON OR TIE THE TOP SIDE THE CRYSTAL STICK ON THE UNDERSIDE OF YOUR LEG AT THE RIGHT BALANCE POINT THAT JUST BINS OVER NICE AND EASY LIKE THAT
IT BUT THAT PRESSURE THERE IS A STEADY PRESSURE OR YOU CAN DO A ROCKING MOTION HIS BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH THAT'S ONE INCH OBJECTS TO THIS WILL HAPPEN SOMETIMES WITH YOUR ANIMAL THAT THEY'LL OBJECT TO A POINT
THAT'S TELLING IS LITTLE TOOL UNCOMFORTABLE FOR EVEN MANA DO IS MOVE TO ANOTHER POINT AND A ONE FROM THERE
FIND THE POINT IS POINT OF THE SHOULDER
YOU WANT TO FIRE TO GET DOWN SO LOW THAT YOU CRAFTS HAVE TO REMOVE RELY FURER YOU FIRE AND OF SO AFTER THIS WOULD BURNS DOWN TO A CERTAIN POINT ON THE ADD TOO MANY THREE PIECES OF WOOD WHATEVER
AND IT START OUT WITH THE BOTTOM PART OF IT THE WHOLE POINT OF IT BEING A PLATFORM OF THAT HAVE LAUGH WARM
WOMEN DO THEY FOUND IS NEAT POINT WHEN I WAS TOUCHING EARLIER WHERE THE RESISTS DIVINEY OF MY FINGER WAS CREATING A LITTLE BIT OF A PITCH BEND IN THE CIRCUIT
AND SO NOW I'M AND DO ANOTHER I'VE GOT THESE WIRES UP I'M GOING TO TRY ALLIGATOR CLIPPING THESE WIRES FROM THOSE POINTS FROM THE BEND POINT RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT HERE
SO YOU JUST CLIP IT'S YOU ONE POINT ON THE SIDE AND ONE ON THE METAL UNLESS FIRE IT OFF
WHEN I DO IT SLOW FOR EVEN A LITTLE BIT QUICKER SO YOU CAN SEE WILL POINT OUT SOME OF THE FINER DETAILS STARTING
BUT THIS POINT IS WHEN IT IN AND ESPECIALLY INGREDIENT FIRST LONGAN AT THAT CRAB MEAT THAT WITH THAT IN AND OUR <UNK> YOU COMBINE LUMP CRAB ALREADY IN HER SKIN A CUP WITH CANS OF KREN THAT'LL WORK IS WE JUST WANT THIS TO SPRAY THROUGHOUT THE BACK IF THEY CAN FRAY
IT'S PRETTY MUCH JUST A KICKING MOTION AGAINST THE HAND OF CONTROLLING IT FROM THAT POINT ON
IF THAT DOESN'T AND THEN THEY'RE DEFINITELY IS PROBABLY SOMETHING WRONG WITH SOME CORK MISSING OR SUCH AN YOU PROBABLY WOULD ONE AND TAKE IT AND AT THAT POINT
THERE'S A POINT WHEN YOU CAN NO LONGER DO IT PERFECT REPETITION
ANYWHERE THAT'S ON THE ACTUAL CLOTHING ITEM BEACON PREDICT WOULD BE ACHIEVE POINT
BASICALLY WE JUST USED UNSLICED BASIC SLICE NOW OUR ONIONS THE BOTTOM PORTION OF OUR GREEN ONIONS WILL GO INTO THE RECIPE IN THE EARLY A POINT OF THEN OUR TOPS WHICH WE'RE ALSO GOING TO USE
MY POINT IS IS PEOPLE TEND TO FOCUS ON THE LINE AND FORGET ABOUT THE SPEED NOT REALIZING THAT THE ODDS OF BEEN MAKING THIS POT ARE VERY GOOD
OF COURSE OF THE POT THE SLOPE YOU'RE PUTTING ON IS PRETTY SEVERE YOU BETTER AIM IT OUT TO THE HIGH POINT
HE CAN TEACH THEM THESE TACTICS GO OVER ROLE PLAYING EXERCISES AGAIN WHEN YOU FIND I'M SAYING SOMETHING PERHAPS INAPPROPRIATE ON THE BALL OR NOT VERY PROFESSIONAL JUST POINT OUT
SOME OF THE HEAD SPIN MY HOOK AROUND SO THAT MOUTH RINSE HANGING DOWN THAT MAKING CONTACT WITH THAT SHARP POINT AND I'M READY TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STEP
I SAY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHOEVER HAS THE BRAKE ACTUALLY HAS CONTROL OF THE TABLE AT THAT POINT IN TIME
HOWEVER IF YOU DON'T BREAK PROPERLY AND SAY YOU SCRATCH ON THE BRAKE WHERE YOU DON'T POCKET OF ALL WHEN YOU'RE DOING AT THAT POINT IS JUST TURNING CONTROL OVER THE TABLE TO YOUR OWN
LOSES ONE YOU CAN FLEX THE FOOT OR POINT TO THE TOE IT'S RELATE THE CORE AND WHAT'S COMFORTABLE FOR YOU
BE FOR THE THING THAT AS WE DISCUSSED MANY TIMES BASE EVER FUNCTION OF OF BRINGING IN THE GARLIC ATMOSPHERE POINT WHICH IS THE RACE AND THEN THEY FLARE NOW BASED ON IT AND THEY COME BACK IN BASEBALL I'M HEMLINE
IT HAS A LITTLE STRETCH POINT WITH A VERY <UNK>
FIRST POINT WILL USE TALK ABOUT IN THE WEB BETWEEN THE THUMB AND THE FIRST FINGER IS LARGE INTESTINE FOUR
AND IF THEY'RE POINT AREAS THAT PARTICULAR LITTLE TENDER THAT'S USUALLY A GOOD SIGN YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT LOCATION
THIS IS A GREAT POINT FOR TREATING OVERALL FOR THE WHOLE HEAD SO NO MATTER WHERE THE PAIN IS ORIGINATING JUST GIVING IT SOME LIGHT OR DEET MASSAGE CAN BE VERY HELPFUL
SO I TEND TO GO OVER AND OVER AND TELL I FEEL THAT THE LINES ARE SUFFICIENTLY DARK ENOUGH ONCE I'VE GOTTEN TO THAT POINT CUFF AND I TAKE MY WORKABLE FIXATIVE SPRAY A NICE FOR INSIDE OF THE AREA AND ORDER TO JUST KEEP THE GRAPHITE DOWN TO START MY COLLAGE
YOU GOTTA FIND A POINT WHERE YOU STOP AND THAT'S ACTIVE RANGE OF MOTION BOOM RIGHT THERE
SO WHEN YOU'RE OUT YOUR GARDENER MAIN YOU GO AND HELP SIDE AGAIN YOU TO STAY LOW DROPS THEN BEGIN FEELS GOOD WIDE STANCE IS UP OR SCORE IT TO A PARTICULAR POINT TO TRY TO GET OVER AND STOP THIS GUY
HE WON'T IT'LL STOP YOU FROM LOOKING THIS HAND UP CLUTTERED MOTIONS WAS PROBABLY MOO POINT
BOY DEFINITELY PREFER A PH A LITTLE BIT HIGHER LIMIT OUT WHEN POSSIBLY SEVEN POINT TO SEVEN POINT FOR
F IN TERMS OF FIVE ONE POINT OF FIVE WHEN ONE SURROUND SOUND AS WELL AS A LEFT CENTER RIGHT ENOUGH SOLVE TYPE MAKES HIM SAFER FOR SPEAKERS
<UNK> IS AN <UNK> AND THAT A LOT OF ACTING IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE UNEVEN AFTER COLLEGE YOU NICE I GUESS IT AT SOME POINT I WANTED TO BE AN ACTRESS
YOU MARKET AND IF YOU HAVE TO WALK AWAY AND COME BACK IT LASH EITHER DO THAT BY CLICKING THE FINE BUTTON RECALLING THAT WAY POINT
THAT LIFE TO MARK A WEIGHT POINT INTO THE UNIT
IN A SHAKA IS THE THIRD EYE POINT AND INDIGO
AND I'LL USE IS A V LOW AND THIS IS A WALL CONTROLLABLE WAY OF PUTTING A SELF ON THE END OF TWO LINES WILL THEN OF THE POINT HERE NEED IN THE MOVE BACK AND FORTH AND UP AND DOWN THE ROAD UP ON THE END THAT BE FULL OF THESE WILL BE SHOWING YOU LATER
THE COMPONENT WILL NOT TURN INDEPENDENTLY BEING THAT THIS IS THE UPPER MOUNTING POINT FOR THE SUSPENSION
NOW TOUCH MODE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO START ALL OVER WITH THE RIGHT AND SIDE BEGINNING IN REVIEW EVERY AUTOMATION POINT YOU CAN TAKE TOUCH AND START WHERE EVER YOU LIKE
POINT THAT IF YOU HAVEN'T ESTABLISH HAVE FIT WHAT ON THE BOTTOM AND THEN I THINK HE'S BEEN THOUSAND OF THAT A LITTLE AND IT
AT THIS POINT ONE OF THE MOST OF THE CHEST OF THE TREE AND THEN WHEN I KICK OVER IT AND TRYING GET PASTA
AT WHICH POINT WE GET CLOSE TO REACH UP ROUTE THE STRING UP A WHOLE DSL OF UP SO THE STRING IS ON THE LOW WAIST
BY THAT POINT YOU'RE UP THERE YOU STAGING YOUR IN YOUR LANE YOU KNOW YOUR STRATEGY NINETY DOES GOTTA GO DELIVER WHAT YOU KNEW CREW TEETH HAVE ALREADY DECIDING
AND THERE'S AN POINT PARTICULARLY IF THE MIGRAINE IT'S GOING TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD OF THE YEAR
ANOTHER GREAT ACUPUNCTURE POINT IS THE SIDE OF THE TEMPLES JUST BEHIND THE BONE HERE OR AN ORGAN OF THE EYE
AT THAT POINT YOU TO PUT IT DOWN IT'S LOW HERE AND IT AND START TO WALK AWAY AT TO THE STAGING LIGHTS
AND ALSO DO AT THIS POINT IS BECAUSE IT GETS ALL MARKS ANOTHER MARKS FROM A PARTING TOOL ALL SQUARE UP THIS THE TOP END OF THE BODY
I'VE I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF THESE THINGS WITH ALL OF OVER WITH YOU ON IT THAT POINT
BUT I WANT TO KEEP IT GET THE MOTIONS NICE SHORTEN SWEET TO THE POINT
IF YOU GET TO THAT POINT YOU'RE IN GOOD SHAPE
A DATA ON OR POINT
AS FAR AS STRONG OPTIONS ARE REALLY HELPS FIND SONG AS AN IN HOUSE WITH JUST QUICKNESS OF WAITER CURSOR MIGHT BE AS FAR AS LIKE IF YOU STOP YOU SONG DOING A CURSOR STOP RIGHT WE STOP DIRTY WHEN TO STOP THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE TRACTOR AND YOU ONE AND STOP A CERTAIN POINT
IF YOU HAVE A OF MORE REASON VERSION PRO TOOLS LIKE SEVENTH WHAT SOME POINT OWN ON IT AND HAVE BEEN FEGAN ARTIE I'M AUTOMATIC INSTALLED IN A PROGRAM
SO THAT'S THE EURO SWEET AND TOOLS FINISHING WITH THE CONVERT ANCHOR POINT
THIS ONE HAS THE HARDER SHARP POINT
THIS ONE HAS THE WEDGED POINT VERY VERY SOFT
ANNICK BASICALLY IS READY TO HANG AT THAT POINT OR BE FRAME
THIS IS PLAYING TEXT YOU NO LONGER EVER TABS DOWN HERE FOR ALL THOSE OPTIONS BECAUSE IT'S JUST POINT TEXT
THAT'S FIVE LETTERS THAT MAKE UP A BLEND YOU CAN START ADDING MORE AND MORE AT THIS POINT BECAUSE YOUR CHILD WILL BE VERY GOOD AT IT
THEY'RE LEVEL OF GIVING IS LOW IF YOU DIDN'T SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A CARD OR A LOWER OR A TOKEN OF SOME SORT AND THAT PERSON DOES NOT RECIPROCATED SOME POINT
YOU WANT TO CONTROL THE SET POINT IF I DON'T WANT TO BE EFFECTIVE IN ATTACKING FROM HERE WE HAVE TO HAVE A PENETRATING FOOTWORK SO FOR EVERY ATTACKING TECHNIQUE YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT'S THE FOOTWORK
WE KNOW THAT WE WANT TO CONTROL THE SET POINT
THE SET POINT IS THAT POSITION TO WEAR ON JUST OUTSIDE AND THIS IS LIKE AN STEP AND AND FIRE ON HIM HE CAN STEP IN AND FIRE ME
HOLDING IT SO THAT THE SINK FOLD IS ON THE BOTTOM THAT'S THE BASE OF OUR COLORS WE ARE GOING TO OPEN UP THE TAIL OF POINT THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LITTLE TRIANGLE FOLDED DOWN
ALSO HAS AS I STRIKE IN THE BAG IT'S CALLED STRIKING IT AND YOU'LL SEE ME SORT OF PUSH THE BAG WITH MY HAND TO GET THE REED STARTED WHEN I'M GONNA WHO SLOUGH AND MAKE A NICE CLEAN CUT OFF BY ITS STOPPING BREATHING IN AND SQUEEZING THE AIR OUT OF THE BAG TO THE POINT WHERE I CAN RELEASE MY ARM QUICKLY AND IT SHUTS OFF LIKE A LIGHT SWITCH
ALREADY WORKING ON HUNTWAY SERIES ONE THE TRANSITION TO WRITE PRACTICE AND FINISH HUNTWAY ONE OF THEM IS READY FOR YOU AT NORMAL SPEED THEN HAVE MELISSA PERFORM IT FOR YOU SLOW DOWN SECOND POINT OUT SOME OF THE FINER DETAILS PICKING IT UP FROM WHERE WE PERFORM ROLLING BLOCK RIGHT TOE KICK
LISTEN AND WE ARE OFTEN SUBLIME AND GOING DOWN YOUR THREE POINT STANCE IS OUR DEFENSIVE ALIGNMENT AND HIS THREE POINT STANCE
THE OFFENSE MIGHT BE SOMETHING ON START THINKING ABOUT AT THIS POINT
ASKING QUESTIONS MEANS THE INFLATION'S LUNG POINT WITH DIMENSION
WHATEVER NEW DESIGN ONE HALF RIGHT THERE AND IT CLOSES AT THAT POINT
AT THAT POINT THE ASIAN IS GENERALLY OFF PAIN MEDICINE AND COMPLETING A SHORT COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS IN STARTING TO GET BACK TO THE NORMAL ROUTINE
SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS NOT GO AND WILL RUN ON A TANGENT WITH THAT INITIAL PERCEPTION WITH OWLS ASKING THE OTHER PERSON POINT BLANK IF NOT PERCEPTION HE'S TRIGGER
AND I THINK IS POINT LAWLIS DOESN'T RIDGES SO YOU DON'T <UNK> THIS IS AARON WREATH AWAKENING ALL I WOULDN'T FREEZING YOURS IF I DON'T ROUGH THE ALWAYS
ONCE YOU GET BUT THAT'S THAT POINT GUARDS AREA THIS IS ALL OF HIS AREA HIS OR HER AREA
NOW AND DEPENDING ON HOW THE PENALTY OFF IS THAT THEY'RE PLAYING AND HOW OF THAT GIVE THAT OFTEN SEE IS THAT WILL DETERMINE HOW FAR YOU POINT GUARD WILL GO OUT
POINT VARIATIONS THE INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF AND WINE YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE QUALIFIED TO CARRY OUT THE TASKS OF DOING YOUR SPECIFIC PLATFORM
AND I THINK I CAN GO ONE BETTER BECAUSE THE THING IS THAT OF JUST TESTING THEM AT THAT POINT AND IN THAT EXPERIENCE I CAN ALSO GIVE THEM SOME OR I CAN OPEN SOME DOORWAYS FOR THEM
THE FIRST POINT ORGAN AND DO IS CROOKED POOL OR LARGE INTESTINE ELEVEN
AND DAMPNESS IF THE LEG COMES TO SWELL UP ON OR IF THE DOG RESPONDS IN IS WORSE IN WORSE PAIN ON DAMP DAYS THIS IS GOING TO BE YOU A GOOD POINT FREE TO USE
ON ICE JUST THAT IS USUALLY THREE POINT SEVEN FIVE INCHES TO FOUR INCHES
FINER CENTER POINT AND SLOWLY ONCE AGAIN THE CENTER AND PULL OUT TOWARDS THE EDGE OF THE SAME TIME
NOW IF WE HAVE OTHER WHAT WOULD GO TO DETERMINE IS WE GO DETERMINE ARE HANG POINT TO ONE GERMAN HOW HIGH THAT WE WANT THIS ON THE WALL
NOW THE FIRST THING WE'LL LOOK AT WHEN YOU'RE HANGING YOUR PICTURES OR LOOK ON THE BACKSIDE AND SEE WHAT TYPE OF ATTACH POINT IT HAS
AT THIS POINT WE'VE INSTALLED FOR COURTS OF OIL
AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS A POINT OF ALTERNATING COME UP AND AROUND
AT THAT POINT IT ASIDE
NOW I MIGHT ACTUALLY IT AT SOME POINT BUT WHAT I WANTED OOMPH IS JUST CREATE A WE'RE ALL TO CREATE A STRAIGHT LINE AND CREATE JUST A MINIMAL LEAN VERY CLEAN LOOK
AND BIG IN AN ELF EXHALE AND IS FLOWING THE BAR DOWN IF BOOM RIGHT THERE IS A GOOD STOPPING POINT
AS AN EVENT OF POINT WAS OF UP FROM THE <UNK> FLIP FLUFF
AND THIS TWENTY SIX GRAMS OF PROTEIN AND IT'S ONLY POINT FIVE GRAMS OF FAT SO IT'S REALLY GOOD
SO ON SO THAT WAS REALLY THE ONLY RISKS FROM ONE OF THE ELECTRICAL POINT OF VIEW UM WILL BASICALLY NINE IF YOU'RE STAYING WITH BATTERY POWERED DEVICES
TAKING THIS FLAP WE ARE GOING TO FOLD IT FROM THIS POINT TO THIS POINT FOLD IT DOWN
IF YOU'VE GONE OVER AND OVER IN YOUR HAD WHAT'S GET WE'RE GONNA DO ALL THE WAY FROM YOUR BURR NOW TO YOUR STAGING YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN DO IT RIGHT IF YOU'VE DONE IT BEFORE IN YOU JUST REMEMBER AT THAT POINT IF YOU LET YOURSELF DO IT THAT YOU'LL YOU'LL DO THE RIGHT THING
IF IT'S A PUBLIC EDUCATION OF FIVE EDUCATIONAL HOME EDUCATION SOMEONE HAS MADE THE DECISION OF WHAT IS IMPORTANT FOR A CHILD TO LEARN AT A CERTAIN POINT AND HOW TO TEACH A AND WHAT IT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE OUT
AT THAT POINT NUMBER TWO HAS THE OPTION TO TAKE NUMBER ONES GET OR GO BACK TO THE PILE AN OPENING THE
IT HAS A PAIR OF KINGS AND AND ORANGES POINT AT THINGS ARE <UNK>
IT AT THE END OF THOSE THREE ROUNDS SOMEONE HAS MORE POINTS THAN THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE IN THE GAME THAT PLAYER IS THE WINNER AND GET ONE POINT FOR EACH STATE RANGE THAT YOU HIT IT
<UNK> THE FUR THIS POINT YOU CAN POSSIBLY SEE IF THE DRYING IT THAT BALANCE IS CLEAN IS AGAIN
SO YOU MIGHT BEGIN BY OKAY UP <UNK> TEACHING YOUR DOG TO GET OUT ON THE TREADMILL AND STANDING THERE AND THEN BEING ABLE TO GET BACK OFF OF THE TREAD NOW THE FLORAL OFF BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY WORK UP TO THE POINT WHERE YOU TURN THE TREADMILL ON IN YOUR DOG BEGINS TO FOR WALK
WE'LL SHOW THAT NEWS FORCE CURRENT IS RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF THEM AND THEY WOULD NEVER SEE AT ANY POINT DURING THAT STORE
IT'LL MAKE AN OVERALL ELONGATED AN OBVIOUSLY WITH THESE KIND OF DRAWING VENT ON IT VERY BEND WITH THE DRAWING AND IS IN WITH A VAST AMOUNT OF A DESERVES REINFORCE THAT WHOLE POINT EVEN MORE SO AND ALL THAT HERE GINGER AND HER SKIN
IN AND NOW AT THIS POINT AND THE LATEST DOWN
IT ALL THAT REALLY HAPPENS IS ONE PERSON STARTS TELLING A STORY IN A TINY FIELDING ONE INSTALL IT IN A JUST POINT SOMEONE ELSE IN A GROUP AND AND PICK UP WITH THE AND IT WAS LEFT OFF
AND WHAT'S THE POINT THAT I WAS LOOKING AT THEIR EYES RUM AND THE THING TO PLAY WITH THING
AND TO IT TAKE IT AWAY AND AT SOME POINT YOU'LL GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU REALLY LIKE IT
BUT JUST PERCH AS IF YOU MARKED ONE AT TWELVE O'CLOCK AND MARK YELLOW ONE AT THREE O'CLOCK YOU DON'T WANT A LINE V ON THE WRONG INDEX POINT WITH THE ROLL OF CAMPBELL
AN IMPORTANT GENERAL POINT FOR ANY BACK AND THE REAR LEG PROBLEMS IS LETTER TWENTY THREE
AND THIS FIND NEW FEELS POINT STICKING UP AND THEN HOLLOWS
FOR IN A ROLL EACH ONE OF THESE THINGS TO INDIVIDUAL LOGS THE POINT TO ATTACH THEN
YEAH VENUS REEDS REALLY HAVE FEATHERY OF ALL THE PLAYERS SOMETIMES AT SOME POINT EITHER THE POINT PLAY THE USE THE OPEN STANCE
AGAIN <UNK> <UNK> AND WE GOT OUR SAUCE BOILING AT THIS POINT
HONEY NILE IT'S TIME TO ON A POINT
NEW SETTING UP A ONE THREE ONE FIRST OF ALL IN ONE IS SET UP WHERE YOUR POINT GUARD IS AT THE TOP THE KEY AROUND IS THERE
YOU POINT GUARD MIGHT ONE COME DOWN IN THE INSIDE HERE
ONLY GET THEM TO THE POINT WITH THE LINGO IN THAN ESCAPE
AND SO ANY WHERE THERE'S A CONTENT POINT OF METAL AND LEVEL OR EVEN THIS PLASTIC OR BONE THAT THAT COMPRISE THAN THAT IT'S A IT'S A PLACE FOR THIS DRINK A BREAK
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE DEALING OUT THE CALVES WHICH SAYS DEAL NOT REAL QUICK THEY WOULD BE A POINT IN TIME THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE FOUR CARDS IN THE KITTY PLUS THE JOKERS THAT'S A KITTY
A LOT OF TIMES IN HIGH SCHOOL THE STUDENT DOES NOT WANT TO PUT THAT MUCH EFFORT INTO IT AND SO OF COURSE IT BECOMES MORE GAME OF DISCIPLINE OR BABYSITTING AT THAT POINT YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO AT LEAST GET AN IMPROVEMENT OR AND LEAVES THE PASSING GRADE
RIGHT NOW I'M REALLY GET OKAY NICE AND HIGH OFF THE BOARD YOU'D SEE A REALLY NICE TIGHT SPIN OKAY WHO SONG POINT PRIDE AND SEE HIM BUT IN THE AIR HE WAS LOOKING FOR THE WATER TO SPOT KICKED OUT NICE AND STRONG PACKET EXPANSION A BECAUSE STRESSES ARMS A LITTLE MORE BUT THAT WOULD REALLY GOOD REVERSE ONE HALF TOUGH
NOW AT THIS POINT YOU CAN JUST CHECK ANY THE EDGES THAT YOU'RE THAT AREN'T THOSE MOVE
ONE LEG AND MAKE THE FLOSS SINK AND ALSO THE VENOM MAKE THEM FLAT RIFLE POINT UP
THE FLY ROD HOOK POINT UP SO THAT IT DOESN'T SNAGGED EFFICIENT MANNER THE BOTTLE
SO IF I TAKE TWO LINES POINT MY TOES DOUBLE FOLLOW UP WITH THIS WAY
<UNK> ARE FUN OF WHO IN HALF TIME INTO IN THROUGH THE KNOT OF HAND AND WHO IS FROM THE LIVE AGAIN INFORMATION OF VIEWING WITH FULLING OF WINDSOR OF NOT AT THIS POINT YOU CAN CHOOSE OF I'M WITH THE BODY MOVEMENT OSHMAN AIM HUTTO <UNK>
WE CAN GRAB YOUR CURVE AT ANY POINT AND PULL IT UP AND DOWN
THERE'S NO POINT POKING OF HOUSE AND FIND A DROP ONE
YOUR HANDS CROSS OVER THE REST IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH IS ON TOP YOUR HANDS DROP DOWN TOWARD ADVICE LIFT UP NIGHT IN A VENDOR ELBOWS AND BRING YOUR FINGERS THE POINT ONE OTHER HEATING ABOUT A ONE TO TWO INCH GAP IN BETWEEN LEG OR BLOCKING THE SUN AND YOUR EYES
PRESET LINE IN HALF NOW AT THIS POINT YOU CAN EITHER FOLDED OUT LIKE THIS INCREASE IT AND CUT ALONG THAT CREASE LAURA TAKE A PENCIL AND DOESN'T RUN IT ALONG THE EDGE OF THE PAPER LIKE THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO BE AT A POINT WHERE BOTH OF YOU ARE GOING TO BE EVALUATING THE DIRECTION
ONCE YOU GET TO THE POINT WE HAVE IT'S OFF OR UNDER COMPUTER LIKE SEVENS UP THE CAN OPEN THEM OUR FILES THERE'S AN OPTION TO EXECUTE THE PROGRAM AS PART OF YEARS FOR SHELL TO IN OPENING MY COMPUTER OR WINDOWS EXPLORE YOU BE A TO JUST RIGHT CLICK ON THE FILE AND UNDER THAT FROM A OR AN ART FROM THERE
SO IN WHEN YOU WERE PLACE JUST A LITTLE POINT WHEN YOU'RE PLACING YOUR TONER GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT TO A PROPER PLACE
SO OF MY TEAM SERVE THE BALL BUT AT THE OTHER TEAM GETS THE BALL AND PUTS IT INTO OUR SIDE OF THE COURT AND THEY GET THE POINT EVEN THOUGH THEY INSERT THE BALL AND VICE VERSA
AT THAT POINT THE TEST THAT WESTERN MEDICINE USES THE OF THE NUMBERS THAT THEY WILL GET WILL SAY OKAY NOW WE HAVEN'T UNION
AND NOW WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE WE'RE GONNA START TO DRIP THE WHOLE THING LAST ONTO THE PREHEATED MANDREL
IT GIVES YOU A PERFECTLY ROUND HOLD THAT HAS A NICE SHARP POINT FOR CUTTING
SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE YOUR YOUR PAPER STAYS ON NICE POINT
NOW I'M TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT SUPER COMP OR TOP DRAGSTER AT THIS POINT BECAUSE THE BURDEN PROCEDURES VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE FROM CARS
AT THAT POINT AND PUT IT IN NEUTRAL AND LET IT AND GIVE IT A QUICK DAD TO THE THROTTLE JUST TO CLEAR THE ENGINE NOW THEY KNOW HOLDING ON IT YOU HAVE TO DO A RELEASE
AT THAT POINT IF YOU LOOK CLOSER HERE YOU ALSO GO TO THAT STEP AND MAKE A VISUAL AND PHYSICAL INSPECTION OF THE CHAMBER MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S NO ROUNDS IN THE CHAMBER
FOR HOPS CAN ADD IF ONE WHEN TO FIVE OUNCES OF CRYSTAL HOUSE A THREE POINT IT HAS DENTAL OFFICE AND FOR SIXTY MINUTES
THEN THE OTHER ONE I FOUND I'M GOING TO DISCONNECT THESE ALLIGATOR CLIPS FLOWS THAT LEDGE POINT KNEES ARE REALLY EXCITING
THE DIFFERENT BOT IS HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ABSORBENCY FROM MOISTURE AND HIGHER BOILING POINT FOR BEAUTY FOR COMPARED TO <UNK>
YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY NOTICE THIS IS YOUR BRAKE ANNOUNCE RED WHICH IS LITERATURE EMPHASIZE THE POINT
BUT WHAT I WANT TO POINT OUT IF I MAY IS THAT HAND WRITING IS SO ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL
GUYS LITTLE THAT POINT PLEASE
A THREE POINT LIGHTING SYSTEM IS CONSISTED OF THREE LIGHTS
AND I'M A TELL YOU HOW TO DO A THREE POINT LIGHTING SYSTEM
I THREE POINT LIGHTING IS THE VERY BASES OF ALL LIGHTING IN THE FALL THESE THINGS AND BRING YOUR INDEPENDENT FILM OR YOUR WHOLE MOVIES TO THE NEXT LEVEL
I'M ACTUALLY DOING LIT RIGHT NOW THE TRADITIONAL THREE POINT LIGHTING SYSTEM
A POINT TAKE YOUR NEW LITTLE WATER KEY CORK THAT IS HEAT UP YOUR GLUE HERE EVER SO SLIGHTLY BELOW DAB WRONG ARE THAT LOOK
A POINT OF THAT LIVE MEANING OF WILL AREA OF THE ONE WITH AN ENCLOSURE GAINING OF THE HEATED WILD LIKE ME THAT MODE AND IF HOME OF LIFE OF THE THING THAT MATTED LAGER HOTTER THOUGH IF
SEE ONE INCH I FIND YOUR HIP BONES POINT OF YOUR HEADLIGHTS FORK
ONCE YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU ACTUALLY MAKE THE TEAM AND MAKE A HIGH SCHOOL TEAM AND ONE EXCEL AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL
AND WHICH ONE A DEUCE CUT EACH THEM OUT SO YOU HAVE A LITTLE POINT ON IT AGAIN AND TO SLIP IT IN BETWEEN THE TWO LOOKS LIKE THAT
AT THIS POINT IN A CONSULTATION AND WENT AHEAD AND TALK WITH MY CLAY AND GET A AND I'M USING A FLUTE GEL
OUR WHEN IT'S SLIGHTLY IN A I'M IT MRIS NOVITSKY OR IN THE OR OH THIS IS REALLY IT'S IT'S VERY ARM ITS ORIGINAL INTO THE POINT OF <UNK> I'M ABOUT KNOWING THE YOUNG KNOWN IN I'M FROM THE EXCUSE ME OF HOW TO
AND IF THIS IS JUST TO POINT OUT THAT IT'S THE EMOTION THAT YOU EXPERIENCING IN THE DREAM WHICH IS MOST SIGNIFICANT
OUR POINT GUARD TYPICALLY ONE OF THE SMALLER GUYS ALL IN THE OFF IN THE INNER SHOOTING GUARDS OR USE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER
DOESN'T POINT AROUND THE SIDES TO WHERE WE PUT THE MASKING TAPE
NOW AT THIS POINT OF OUR DOES CAN RUN BACK ON THE FIELD THIS BARRELS GOOD TO GO AND THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO DO
I HAVE A SENSE OF HOW FAST IT WOULD BE FROM HALFWAY AND THAT I'VE TRIED APART IT FOR THAT HALFWAY POINT WITH THE RIGHT SPEED
SO I'M TRYING TO PICK A HIGH POINT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE BALL IN THE HOLE
I GO UP TO THAT HIGH POINT AND I'LL MAKE A COUPLE PRACTICE THROWS LOOKING AT THE HOLE
AS YOU START TO STUDY OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK IN LEARN THE TECHNIQUE THEY USED TO GET TO THE POINT WE ARE READY TO START COMING UP WITH YOUR OWN TECHNIQUES AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T LOOK AT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE AND ON THE NEW RELIGIOUSLY RESTRICTED TO YOUR INITIAL IDEAS
AND THEN WE START BREAKING THE SILICA OFF WHICH IS VERY BRITTLE AT THIS POINT WITH SLEDGE HAMMER ISN'T THINGS LIKE THAT TO EXPOSE THE BRONZE
AND IF YOU DON'T END UP WITH THIS HALF BALL AND TAKE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PART OF IT AND POINT IT UPWARDS
PILLOW BUT A PRESSURE POINT A LOT OF DARK CIRCLES CAN BE CAUSED ON FROM EITHER SINUS CONGESTION AND WORK ON JUST HAS A SEEMS A THIN THERE A LOT OF LEVELING VERY CLOSE TO THE SURFACE
GUYS CANNOT STAND UP THE STAND UP IN THE RIVER YOU CAN AND PROBABLY WELL AT SOME POINT GET A FOOT ENTRAPMENT
IF YOU FALL OUT OF THE ROUGH TODAY A FEW THINGS YOU NEED TO REMEMBER TO LIGHTEN YOUR BACK YOU POINT TWO FEET DOWN STREAM WHICH IS THE DIRECTION THE REVERSE GOING AND YOU LOOK FOR HELP
THERE ARE TWO SIDES STRAIGHTENERS THAT YOU CAN DO AT THIS POINT
LUNG POINT OUT OF THE THE TORSO CHEERS
I'LL DO THREE POINT LIGHTING AND ICE
AND IT'S A SIX POINT FIVE AND A C THAT'S EXTRA STIFF
IF NOT TO THE POINT WHERE HE WOULD BE AROUND AWAY OUR PRIMARY THING LIKE THAT BUT IT JUST DOESN'T GET IN QUITE A SNAP IT TURN AND I WOULD LIKE AND SO THIS IS A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT CALLED OVER THE POLE TIED ON
IT'S JUST BELOW THE POINT WE JUST DID IN IF CAN BE AGAIN IN A MUSCLE BELLY JUST BELOW THE KNEE RIGHT IN FOR THE BONE
NEXT TOOL DOWN IS THAT DELETE ANCHOR POINT TO AGAIN WE JUST WANT TO DELETE SET IT THAT WAY IT GOES
AND ALL FINAL TOOL IN THAT ANDERLE IS THAT CAN THE ANCHOR POINT TOOL
SO GO THE PEN TOOL UNDERNEATH THAT HAND TO ABOUT THAT AT ANCHOR POINT TOOL WHICH IS PRETTY SELF EXPLANATORY
WE DECIDE WHAT HAD A POINT SIMPLY CLICK RIGHT THE AND FORGET SUB SELECTION TOOL DRAG THAT OUT
AT THAT POINT SHOULD DEALER REACH INSIDE THAT TIRE AND REMOVE THE FLAT INNER TUBE
AND IT TO THE POINT WHERE IT SHOULD ALMOST LOOK FAKE
BASICALLY IT THE POINT OF THIS IS TO HEAT THE WATER TO THAT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT
NOW WE CAN HOLD THIS ONE POINT
NOW WHEN YOU'RE STRETCHING YOU WHAT A HOLDS YOUR STRAPS TO THE POINT OF MY OLD DISCOMFORT
SO ZOOMING OUT IS ACTUALLY IF YOU CAN PRACTICE IT TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN DO THAT ON CUE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS AND HAVE SOMETHING JUST FLIP FROM THE HEART IT'S AMAZING THE WONDERFUL THINGS THAT CAN COME OUT OF SEVEN AND
NOW THE POINT IS TO GET ALL THE CARDS OVER THE TOP BUT IN ORDER TO GET WITH THE TOP YOU'D HAVE AN ACE
AND SO THEN FATE CAN JUST LOWER RIGHT TO THAT POINT AND THEN BRING HER WEIGHT BOARDING COME RIGHT UP AND TEAR UP DOG
IF SHE'S TO SWIRL USUALLY GET MYSELF IN TROUBLE BECAUSE IT COULD MAKE IT TOO THIN TOOTH <UNK> ONLY NEAR THAT POINT AND HALF
MAKE SURE THAT YOUR WHOLE WHOLE BUT NOT TO THE POINT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL OR BECOMING OVERBEARING BECAUSE ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS ABOUT OCD ISN'T THE INDIVIDUAL LOSES EVERY SENSE OF CONTROL THAT THEY HALF ARE THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE CONTROL
THAT IS EIGHT POINT TO FIVE MILLIMETER IN THICKNESS AND FOURTEEN MILLIMETER IN LINK AND WE HAVE DONE AND FROM HERE TO HERE
BEFORE I GET STARTED WITH MY DEMONSTRATION OF LIGHT TO POINT OUT THE SIZES THAT I HAVE USED ON CAMS EYE
AT THAT POINT WHICH WILL DO IS YOU WILL TAKE THE SLIDE IN AND PULL THE SLIDE BACK
IF YOU SEE THAT WE JUST RUIN OF I'M CHANGE AND AS A SONG PLAYS WAS BECAUSE THAT POINT IS A STAR FADING DOWN AND IT WAS A GLOVE ETHNIC SUPER GLUE THAT THAT UP TO THE
<UNK> HAS POINT FOR NEXT IN HOME AND YOU CAN WEAR IT ACTUALLY CAN BE THE <UNK>
THE BALL OR ACTUALLY SMALL FOR WILL HAVE THIS RESPONSIBILITY I HEAR ANYTHING BEYOND THAT POINT GUARDS REACH IS ON ON THIS SIDE OF THE COURT WILL BE THAT SMALL FORCE RESPONSIBILITY
ON THE OTHER SIDE SAME THING WITH SHOOTING GUARD ANYTHING OVER THEIR PASS THE POINT I WILL BE THAT POINT THAT SHOOTING GUARD RESPONSIBILITY
SO YOU HAVE THE POINT GUARD UP TOP BATTLE FOLD RIGHT HERE A THINNER WILL BE A LITTLE FURTHER BACK WHICH IT WHAT YOU HAVE IS YOU HAVE A SMALL FOUR YEAR AGO HAVE THE SHOOTING GUARD ON THE OTHER SIDE SUPPORT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEFENSE
AND THEN YOU WANT A POINT USE YOU OR THROUGH THE CENTER OF THOSE TWO OVERLAPPING ON A FLAT
THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL AS A POINT TO POINT
SO I MIGHT HEIGHT THAT HALF POINT AS IF AN AND READY TO GO AHEAD AND DESIGN MY CENTER PIECE
NOW WE HAVE TO DO IS KIND OF OPEN THIS SECTION UP HERE AND GIVE IT A LITTLE ROOM IN AN HOLD RIGHT HERE THE POINT OF THE NECK
AGAIN I'M BASICALLY JUST COME ALONG SQUASH SQUASH FOLD THIS BY GRABBING THIS POINT PULLING IT DOWN TO WHERE IT IS IN LINE WITH OUR WING SECTION HERE
SAME THING HERE OFF THIS BACK POINT CUTTING KEEPING IT EVEN THAT WING RIGHT THERE
NOW OVER THE WINGS LIKE THIS AND THEN FOLD THEM DOWN PULLING OFF THIS POINT HERE AND FOLD IT DOWN INTO A FORWARD FOLD
SO AT THIS POINT AS LONG AS I BREAK IT AWAY FROM THE STEM
WHEN I STARTED I HAD TO USE A HAIR DRYER WHICH WAS OKAY BUT IT'S A LOT OF AIR AND NOT ENOUGH HEAT AND THEN THERE'S A THIN CALLING EMBOSSING DOWN THAT'S GETS US SCRAPBOOK REVIEWS AND AGAIN THAT'S TOO MUCH HEAT IN ON THE THINNER YOU CAN WORK TO TOGETHER WITH THAT GETS TO BE A LITTLE CUMBERSOME SO AT SOME POINT YOU MIGHT INVEST IN A HEAVIER DUTY TOOL LIKE THIS
INSTEAD OF THROWING AWAY I TOOK SOME THIS LITTLE PIECES OF COPPER SLIPPED IT INTO THE LITTLE BENT PIECE OF THE PAN POINT AND MADE A LITTLE FOOT THAT I CAN ALSO USE WITH THE WAX
NOW I HANDY LITTLE THING IS IS THAT I THINK I SAID BEFORE THAT THIS LITTLE PIN POINT IF YOU DROP IT YOU KNOW MESS UP THE POINT AND LITTLE BAND LIKE THIS ONE HAPPENS TO BE BENT
ALSO ANOTHER ON QUICK POINT DIMENSION FALL THAT ONE IS THAT I DO HAVE TO GET THE BUTT TONGS SAFELY ALLOWING THE TRACK WHICH IS A FOUR INTO THE LIME THEN SOMETIME THE LOCK OF SPEED COMPENSATE FOR A BASIC FOR TAUNT EXCHANGES
I SAY I'M ABOUT TWO THIRDS TO MAYBE NOT QUITE AS IT'S HALF WAY UP ON MY CONTAINER SO MY FIRST LASAGNA LAYER AND AND PUT THE LARGER BULBS IN BECAUSE THE POINT IS A LARGER BULBS WILL WORK UP THROUGH THE SMALL OR BOLTS
AND DAY TO DAY ON MY AVERAGE TO COME DOWN TO THE VERY LOWS POINT
OKAY AT THIS POINT IT'S GOOD TO DO A LOT OF LOOKING LIKE THAT FOR THAT HAS THE TO DROP THAT SIEVE AND STRAIGHTEN OUT SOME OF THE MATERIAL
SO LET'S USE THAT AT THAT POINT MAN YOU GET THERE AND THE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT BECAUSE THEY'VE EXPLAIN THAT TO YOU PARTY APPOINTMENT YOU WILL BE SITTING IN A CHAIR AND THEY WILL PREPARE THE I'M PROTECT THE EYE AREA
EACH ROUNDED OF CLAVE TO A POINT TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY
