REPLACING REPLACING THE JACK UNDERNEATH THE PAIN IS THE BEST BOUGHT THE DECK UP THE SO YOU DON'T PUT A HOLE IN THE END AND PAINT WILL THIN ITSELF
IF YOUR PAINT IF YOU'VE PAINTED IT IN YOUR RUBBER BAND WOULD INTERFERE WITH THAT ON SOME TEETH
YOU MIGHT EVEN TAKE A SPONGE AND PUT IT IN YOUR PAINT AND MAKE SPONGE DESIGNS
HEART PAINT ON AND BECOME FOR BOTH SO ON
I'VE GOT SOME BASIC GO ACRYLIC PAINT HERE
SO IT WILL LIKE TO BLOW ON A PIECE TO GET THE ACCESS PAINT OFF BUT I FIND SOMETIMES THAT CREATES THAN DIRT MARKS SO I TEND TO THIS SHEET PIECE OFF
I REALLY LIKE THE NONABRASIVE NICE AND BIG THING BECAUSE REALLY ARE NOT TOUCHING THE PIECES A WHOLE LOT AND WHEN YOU RPG ARE CLEAR GLAZE ON WHAT CAN HAPPEN IS YOU AS SOON AS THE PIECE GETS WET YOU RE ACTIVATE THE PAINT ON AND ONE OF HEAT REACTIVATED IT'S VERY EASY FOR YOU TO START MOVING IT WHEN YOU ARE BRUSHING IT ON
I'M <UNK> WITH SIMPLY THINK OF CAKEY PAINT YOU ARE GOING FOR A SIMPLE MORE CASUAL LOOK WHERE SNEAKERS WILL PROBABLY BE ARE MOST POWERFUL OPTION
IF IT WERE DONOR WHO GUIDE YOU CONNECT THE HOT AND EXPECT TO PAY AT A BAR YOU CAN EXPECT TO PAINT OUT AND THEY WERE FROM TEN TO ABOUT FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR DUCA BOTH THE SLOW
IF YOU CAN AFFORD OF NICE COAT OF WHITE PAINT WOOD IS ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA ALSO IF THE CARPETING IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO TO VACUUM FOR INSTANCE THIS CARPET ISN'T THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CARPET WE ALL AGREE I'M SURE YOU CAN HAVE IT LIFTED UP WITH SOME NEWER CAR GRADIENT FOR MAYBE UNDER THOUSAND DOLLARS IF NOT YOU LEAVE IT AND MAKE IT CLEAN
IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO SKETCH DROP PAINT DESIGN YOU WILL HAVE MANY MANY OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU
SOME OF THE ARM SPACKLING COCKING SPRAY PAINT NO MATTER WHAT WHATEVER FALSE FROM UP TOP INCLUDING REAL THICK PAINT DROPS IT'S NOT AN OBLIQUE THROUGH
AGAIN HERE'S TO KIND OF PAINT
IS LIVE A HIGHER IN PAINT IT'S USUALLY A WATER BASAL THICKER ON THESE I'M GETTING THAT OFTEN SOONER OR DEPEND ON HOW LONG IT'S BEEN ON
THIS IS YOU MORE A GENERIC PAINT USUALLY A VEGETABLE BASE OIL
YOU CAN COVER YOUR TWO WITH THE CRAFT PAPER FIRST AND THEN PAINT AND DECORATE ON THE CRAFT FAVOR
THEY USE ON THEY GET THIS IT'S A BLUE TYPE OF PAINT
AND SO THAT IS ONE WAY THAT I CAN KIND OF CREATE STYLE FOR MYSELF USING PHOTOGRAPHIC EMULSION THAT PAINT UP TO ONE O'CLOCK
AND I CAN PAINT THIS PHOTOGRAPH OF A MOTION ON TO WATERCOLOR PAPER
THEY HAVE AN ACE IN AN EIGHT OF DIAMONDS IN THE WHOLE WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT AT THIS TIME STATISTICALLY IF THERE IS A DECENT CHANCE THAT THREES WILL BE WHILE LATER IN ITS PAINT
WE'RE DISCUSSING SEQUENCE AND AS WITH ANY STUD POKER GAME THAT USES WHILE CARDS BUT JUST ENOUGH TO HEIGHTEN THE SKILL FACTOR WE NEED IS A TO DISCUSS HOW TO PLAY EARLY IN THE PAINT
NOW TO SEE HOW TO PAINT THE STRAWBERRY WHICH A MATE FROM PLAIN MARS UPON IE MADE IN TOWN THAT THEY AGO IT STRAIGHT OUT TO A ON HEART NOW
AND USUALLY WHEN WE ARE FINISHED WITH A PAINTING WE WILL GO AROUND AND CLEAN UP ALL THE EXCESS PAINT AROUND IT BECAUSE IT ONCE IF PAINTS THERE IT'S CAN BE FIRED IN A GLAZE
THIS LOOKS REALLY PET BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF PAINT ON IT BUT IT'S STILL WORKS GREAT
AND YOU PUT A LITTLE MORE PAINT OR THE INDIAN BRISTLES
SO WHAT I'LL DO IS I'LL TAKE A LITTLE PAINT OFF A LITTLE PINK PAIN AND THIS CAN GO AHEAD AND GET THAT GO ON IT REAL QUICKLY UP AROUND YOUR CUTICLES DOESN'T EVEN MATTER THAT IT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN A LITTLE SLIME MAKE SURE THAT IT GETS UP THEIR CLOSE THE CUTICLE AND STARTS THE LAYERING PROCESS
NOW THIS IS I HAVE NO THOSE THINGS IF YOU HAVE LIKE LITTLE I'M GETTING SOME LITTLE PIECES OF LIKE LITTLE LOBBIES IN MY PAINT THAT HAPPENS ONCE IN AWHILE I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHY THE CLEAN YOUR BRUSH AND START OVER GRAB ANOTHER WILL SPEC A PAINTING HANDS WILL KEEP GOING
SO I'M GOING TO APPLY THIS BASE THING OVER AND OVER THE MASKING TAPE AND THAT WILL HELP ME PLACE A NICE EVEN COAT OF COLORED PAINT ALONG THE PICTURE FRAME
THE GLASS AND MY RIGHT HAND CAN BE THOUGHT OF THE PAINT AND DOING THE APPLYING OF THE PAINT OR THE HOT GLASS BELOW THE FLAME
THE MEDIUM AND PUT IN THE PAINT TO KEEP IT IN THE FABRIC DRIES PRETTY QUICK
YOU NEED TO ON HAVE THREE TO FOUR BRUSHES WATER AND TRY TO RUSH OUT OR ALCOHOL ON AND POSSIBLY ON ANOTHER TELL TO KEEP ALL THE PAINT ON
SUCH AS GREASY SURFACES OR DUSTY CHALKY SERVICES AND A SHOW THE PAINT STICKS AND LITTLE SERVICES
AND SO IS LITERALLY HEARD TURNING YOUR PAINT
OF THE TAKE THE WATER GO OVER THE PAINT LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN PULL COLORS OUT
ALL OF A ME IS ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS AND PAINT OFF THE WAY TO A MOVE IS WITH THE FIRST YOU PAY MOST <UNK> YOU KNOW AND THEN I'M STOPPED THAT YOU WILL WARRIORS <UNK> WITH YOU AND YOU CAN'T REALLY AIM ONE SHOT
WHICH YOU CAN PAINT SIDING WEEDING REALIZE PINNING IT WIDE THAT PORCH WAS RESTORED THERE WAS A CONCRETE FOUR TO EIGHT THAT'S ALL THAT WAS THERE
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT TEXTURE IN SOMETHING NEW THIS ONE USE IT AS AS A LAY DOWN MEDIUM YOU COULD ALSO USE THAT IN AND MIX IT WITH THAT COULD COUSIN IS OIL YOU KNEW USING MINERAL SPIRITS YOUR PAINT THINNER AND YOU CAN APPLY THAT LIVE LATTICE HAPPILY THIS DRILL WITH AND WILL BLENDED NTH AND STILL LEAVE A LIVE OF THE TEXTURE OF DENSITIES EFFECT ENGLERTH FOR SLICED MUCH GOOD HAND
WE TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME LEARNING TO KEEP CHANGING OF TURNING THE PAINT WHAT'S THE NEXT WORD THAT NEXT
SO SOME TEXT ON AN BEING A GOOD NEED ON WOULD BE IN A JUST PAINT CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TELL TO THE SMALL THINGS THAT THAT PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT WAITING DOWN
DECIDE WHAT IF PAINT BRUSH
NOW THAT WE'VE LAYERED RC SOLVENT OUT SINCE ALL WE'VE GOT THE PAINT COLOR THAT'S THE ROWS SCENTED AND THE WHITE WHICH IS THE VANILLA SCENTED AND PUT OUR LID ON OUR JAR AND WHEN IT'S FREEZE IT OUT WITH AN CURLING RIBBON
AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO PAINT A WOODEN FOOD TRAY
ON ALSO GOT SOME THESE ARE ACTUALLY A CLAY SCULPTURE TOOLS BUT YOU CAN USE THEM TO KIND OF PULL OUTLINES AN ODD SHAPES WE HAVE THE PAINT ON THE CANVAS
I ALSO HAVE THIS PUFFY PAINT WHICH IS USED ON ON IT'S MADE TO PUT ON CLOTHING BUT IT ACTUALLY IS A REALLY NEAT ON WAY TO APPLY PAINT TO YOUR CANVAS
THIS IS THE TYPE OF PAINT THAT GOES OVER PUT SO A LAYER ON TOP OF THE PICTURE FRAME
I'M GOING TO NEED SOME WINE FICK BASED PAINT
I'M ALSO GOING TO BE USING A PENCIL AND SOME PAINT BRUSHES AND HAVE A FEW MARKERS ON HAND SOUND WITH THE DECORATIONS
IT'S NOT SHOWN YOU HOW TO PAINT THE OUTSIDE OF THE PICTURE FRAME
BUT ANYTHING WILL DO A PAINT BRUSH OR EVEN YOUR FINGERS
FIRST THING WITH THE PAINT THE RIGHT TYPE OF CLEANS OR TO GO TO THE RIGHT TYPE OF SURROUND
THE HOUSE AND I THINK IT'S YOUTH WITH PAINT ON
NOW IF YOU'RE BUILDING A UNIT LIKE THIS YOU CAN WITH LEAVE THE EDGE THERE LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN PAINT IT HOWEVER IT JUST WON'T LOOK AS GOOD AS IF YOU WOULD PUT A PIECE OF TRIM THERE AND PAINTED THE TRIM
IN THE LAST THING ACTUALLY I LIKE TO DO IF AFTER THAT LAYER IS YOU TAKE YOUR PALETTE KNIFE AND CUT IT AND PUT IT IN SERVINGS IN LITTLE GOUGES YOU'RE IN THE PAINT
OTHERWISE WE JUST PAINT THE WHOLE THING DARK TO BEGIN WITH
OUNCE AND A NOW IF YOU CAN SEE THE HOLE IN MY BRUSH ON IN THE PAINT TO TAKE A NICE LIGHT ON BECAUSE MY SURFER GUY IS CAN HAVE SPIKY HERE
TAKE YOUR PAINT AND ROLL IT A LITTLE BIT ON THE EDGE OF YOUR TOWEL WITHOUT USING TO DAB LIP AND GIVE YOU A CHANCE EYE YOU WANT A CHANCE TO FALL OUT
IT IS LIKE EQ BRANCHES WILL BENEFIT OF CAN AND FLY WILLY CAREFULLY NOT TO MAKE A BIG BLOB BECAUSE IF YOU DO TOO MUCH PAINT ON A GIVEN I HAVE A MUCH DETAIL
THEY PAINTING ON PIECES STEEL THAT THEY WANT LOCATER PATTERN DOWN AND THEN THEY'LL USE ON A METAL SCRIBE OR SHARP OBJECT AND THEY'LL SCRIBE THROUGH THE PAINT ON TO THE STEEL
IN LEFT LEG IS GOING TO COME UP PAINT SO IT'S AROUND THE BALL AND HOOK THE POLE WITH THE TOP OF YOUR FLAT
IF NOT SEES THE PAINT OTHER GOGGLES IF IT PROPERLY SECURE AND MEMBER SLEIGHT OF LOVE
THE PAINT IS A DOG TEETH
NOW LET'S LOOK AT YOUR PAINT
DON'T APPLY TOO MUCH BECAUSE IT IS A VERY THICK PAINT AND IT GOES ON VERY HEAVY
SO WE CAN SEE IS WE APPLY THIS WHITE PAINT IS A VERY THICK HEAVY PAINT AND IT COVERS COVERS ALL THE MARKS ON OUR BOX
NOW WE'RE GOING TO APPLY THE Y BASED PAINT TO THE BOXES
AND THAT SAY HEY HOW WHEN IS THE HUMAN TOOTH PAINT IS GETTING SO IN JUST A MINUTE AND ONE ACTS YOU HOW TO SHOW ME
IF FOR DESHA LAYING OUR ON LIZARD WE'RE GOING TO USE ACRYLIC PAINT SUN TEMPERA GLITTER PAINT AND WE'LL ALSO BE USING SOME SEQUENCE AND SOME GOOGLY EYES
I HOPE THAT THIS IS GIVING YOU SOME IDEA OF THE VARIATIONS OF COMMONLY USED LIGHTER COLOR PAPERS AND A IT CERTAINLY WILL AFFECT HOW YOU PAINT AND AND WHERE YOU CAN TAKE THESE PAPERS WHETHER IT'S OUTDOORS IN
SO IT'S ALSO EASY TO PAINT IT WHILE IT'S ON AND ON THE STATE BECAUSE A BALL IS HARD TO GRIP WALL WALL PAINTING IT SO ON THIS LEG USES WAY TO HOLD ON TO THE BALL AND GET ALL SIDES UNDERNEATH AND ON TOP ALL AROUND THE BALL VERY EASILY WHILE IT'S ON THE STICK
DOESN'T MATTER IF THE STICK GETS PAINT ON IT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE INSERTED INTO THE MILK CARTON
NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PAINT THE STYROFOAM BALL BEING THAT THE STYROFOAM BALL IS GOING TO BE SITTING AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH IT'S GOING TO BE THE CENTER OF THE WINDMILL WE'RE ALL ALL THE ARMS ARE GOING TO BE HANGING
THIS IS GOOD BE STRAIGHT PAINT
THE CHINESE BLACK TEA IS NAMING GREAT IT IN LEAF SIZE AND ALSO WHERE IT'S WHERE IT'S PRODUCE AND WHAT PART OF THE KICKING WITH I NEED WHEN IT WAS PAINT
I'M GOING TO TAKE MESS THAT SIMPLY PAINT IT ON A WAS FILES TO TAKE THE TOP SIDE OF MY HANDLE AND PRESS IT AGAINST THE MUG UP LIKE SO
AND THE MORE TIME IT TAKES TO PAINT A PAINTING THE LESS INCOME BASICALLY
AND AS YOU'LL SEE ON THIS THE ON THIS PIECE HERE WHICH I'VE ALREADY LAID OUT THERE'S A NUMBER OF VERY INTRICATE DETAILS ON THIS THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MEAN EXTRAORDINARY EXTRAORDINARILY LONG TIME TO ACTUALLY PAINT
PAINT IS THAT AREA WE'RE PROBABLY BEST KNOWN FOR
THERE'S BEEN SOME PAINT WON'T AT LAST TIME IN THIS ONE IT'S MIXED INTO THE OIL
IN THIS CASE YOU RIDGES PAINT THE EDGES ALSO
HAVE A GOOD SUPPLY OF PAPER IN A GOOD SUPPLY OF PAINT SEND AN AND PENCILS THEN YOU'LL BE READY TO GO
I AM LOOKING OVER THE NAILS AND THE SLIT NEAR THE COLORS THAT WOULD GET SO FAR AND I THINK AND ONE AND A TAD THAT A RED SO I MIGHT JUST ON THE DRIVE WEBSITE GET A LITTLE BIT OF THAT RED PAINT ON THERE AND KNOCK SOME THAT OFF AND JUST A TAD BET
WHAT THEY DO IS WHEN YOU'RE PAINTING WITH THE ROLLER ISN'T INTONATION TO GO IN PAIN ALWAY UP TO THE TAPE BLOCK WE REALLY SHOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THE MORE PAINT YOU PUT ON THE TAPE YOU CREATE A SEAL SO THAT WHEN YOU PULL THE TAPE BACK YOU WIND UP PULLING THE PAINT AND MESSING UP A LOT OF GOOD WORK
YOU ALSO WANT ALWAYS USE SMOOTH EASY EASY STROKES AND BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVER PAINT YOUR OF PREPARATION LIE
AND THE PAPERS HOT ON A GRETEL ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TOUCH THAT WAX BLOCK EASY IN YOU CAN DIRECTLY TO PAINT WITH THE WAX
AND CAN HARD TO TELL WITH BLACK 'CAUSE IF HE FLESH BEING BLACK IS IT IS HARDER TO TELL WHAT HOW MUCH PAINT YOU GONNA SO
THAT'S WHY I CHOSE TO USE METALLIC PAINT
IF I'M A SET IT UP AND CLEAN IT THEN I WILL ACTUALLY TAKE THIS AND WITH WARM SOAPY WATER PREFERABLY WITH THE O RING OFF WASH THIS AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE PORTS ALONG THE BARREL SERVICE ARE CLEANING CLEAR PAINT TO BREAK
AND REALLY HAVE KIDS OR A WHAT HE WILL GO IN AT A STORE UP INTO THE SEAT OF USE AND PAINT AROUND IT WILL SEE IT'S OF USE
I'M ISN'T THAT NOW WE'RE GOING TO DEMONSTRATE HOW TO SMOOTH OUT THE WALL WITH <UNK> FIRST COAT OF PAINT ON
SO YOU JUST CUT HAVE TO THINK IN TERMS OF THE LAYERS GOING BACKWARDS VERSUS WHEN YOU PAINT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
STUFF ON THUMB TO START WITH AND WENT YOU PAINT WITH ACRYLIC ON GLASS YOU DON'T USE ANY WATER ON THE PAINT BECAUSE IT TENDS TO STREET IF PEOPLE WATER ON IT AND THAT'S NOT DOWN AND SOME REALLY CAN HELP YOUR PAINTING OIL
SOME PAINT VIBRATING AFFECTED THERE IN A FILL PAIN WITH AS BURNING RADIATING PAINT LOCAL PAIN HOW MUSCLE TENSION PRESSURE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS
IT'S A LAYOUT OF PAINT
YOU CAN DO THIS TWO OR THREE TIMES UNTIL YOU CAN OFFER HAND AND SHE'S A LONGER TRIES TO BITE BEFORE STANDING UP ONTO THE NEXT PAINT
TO GRAB YOUR PAINT IF YOU CAN READING A KEY THOUGHT THAT HANDLE THAT CAN OVER HERE SO THAT WHEN IT FLEX IT DOESN'T GET OUT TO THE HANDLE
YOU WANNA SEE IN OF THE THE THE PAINT IT ON OUR SKIN THAT THE PAINT ON FAKE THAN THAT THAT YOU JUST PUT ON HER FACE THROW
THAT WAY THE PAINT FLIES OVER IS THAT WHEN I'M THAT HANDLE THAT'S WITH IT HAVE <UNK> AND ZONE
YOU CAN ALSO GET STICKS OF THE PAINT STORE
THE OTHER THINGS WILL BE USING AS A A NUMBER EIGHT IN BRAIDED WREATH FRIEND OR ON A THREAD FOR DOING OUR CROCHET PAINT TWO COLORS OF EMBROIDERY FLOSS
AND IT OUT OF IT IT HAS PAINT LATER OF AND AN EXTENDED OR AN
THERE'S THE OIL BASED HAVE SO WHICH IS A LOT OF FUN IN IT LANDS OF EITHER WITH A FEW TIPS ARE ACTUALLY I'VE TRIED IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF THONG PAINT REMOVER LACQUER THINNER AND IT'S AN INTERESTING PROCESS BUT I THINK JUST TO KEEP THE SMELLS DOWN AND JUST HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN TO STRIKE BLENDING IT FIRST WITH THE PROFESSIONAL CUTE HIT HER UP OR THE NOTES THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER AND I'LL EXPLAIN TO THOSE YOU JUST A MINUTE
MOSTLY PASTEL TIGHT COLORS FROM THE SOFT PASTEL BLUE ON THE NAPE OF THE HERE THE SOFT PAINT ON THE TREES BUT IN A ROSE
AS THEY SHOULDN'T FILL UP THE HOLES WITH THE PAINT
I CALL IT SPILLING THE PAINT BOXED BY DOES DESIGN
AND WE GO SIDEWAYS LIKE IS TO GET MORE PAINT ON DRIVE
ON IT YOUR THUMB ON A PERSON PAINT YOU MIGHT USE MOP S THIS MUCH SMALLER PORTION TO ALTER SIZE
A STAYS OUT GET SO HARD CROSSED WHICH MAKES IT EASIER TO PAINT SO THIS IS THE STRAWBERRY THAN IT YOU CAN SEE THAT HIS ULREY SHAPE IT EARLY TO DO ANYTHING WITH A SHADES BUT WE CAN CUT LIFT
AND SOME OF THINGS YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT FIRST ENDS ON WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO PAINT YOUR INSIDE YOUR DESIGN FIRST OR WHETHER YOU ARE GOING TO DO THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOARD OR HOW MUCH IS GONNA BE THE AND NATURAL GORDER SHOWING
YOU CAN ALSO HAVE TO USE ON WHAT THEY HAVE OUT ON THE MARKET NOW THEY'RE CALLED PAINT TURNS
ANOTHER WAY AND IN MY MIND IS WOULD BE JUST BUT EVERY ARTIST RING IS TO MOVE TO SOME CLAY SLIGHT NEW YORK PARIS ITALY SOME VALUE EXOTIC IT OR LOCATION ANYWHERE LIKE THAT OPEN UP YOUR LITTLE ART GALLERY YOUR VERY OWN LARGE GALLERY AND JUST PAINT
WHICH YOU SHAKE IT PAINTED ON TAKES SEPARATE LOTH BELOVED OUT AND IT'S OKAY WITH THIS ACTUALLY HAVE PAINT ON BOTH SIDES YOU BRUSH
THIS GUY HAS A PAINT STILL THE COMES DOWN HOOKS INTO OUT ROLLERBLADE WHEELS
AN ARROW SPRAYER HOMES THE PAINT THROUGH EURO ORIFICE AND MAKES IT OUT INTO YOUR YOUR YOU FIND SPRAY FINISH AND OUT YOU HAVE YOUR ADJUSTMENT ON HERE TO ADJUST YOUR PRESSURE
THIS IS A GOOD WORKOUT PAINT TO GET READY TO PAINT THE EXTERIOR EAVES
AND THEN JUST SOME SUBTLE PINKS TO THE EDGES RETIRE GUTS AND AN EVEN ON THE OUTER EDGE YOU WILL OFTEN SEE A BIT OF THE EDGE OF THE PAINT OF THE INSIDE OF THE EYE WITH
IT IS IT AROUND THE TABLE MOMENT TO USE MY LASHOMB TO BIND TOGETHER DOUBLE MY ARTIST TOOLS ARE A COUPLE PAINT BRUSHES A PENCIL AND A MARKER
NOW IT IS A TEAM THAT'S NOT REALLY SHOOTING A LOT OF JUMP SHOTS AND ARE NOT REALLY HITTING LET A JUMP SHOTS AND THEY'RE REALLY PENETRATE AND PAINT YOU MIGHT ONE A PACK IT IN A LITTLE BIT
THE OLDER ONES LIKE THIS THEY'RE PAINTED ON AND IT'LL SMEAR THE PAINT IN YOUR ORNAMENT WILL BE RUINED
AND YOU KNOW THAT THE FOUR OF EQUAL THAT AIRBRUSH THE MORE PAINT EVEN IT OUT AND ONE THING IF YOU WANTED UNLESS YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THIS LIKE THAT THEN YOU ONE WAS THAT HE CAN
OKAY WE GET A PAINT YOU PLAY AROUND WITH A LITTLE BIT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE AT RUST LITTLE OR A COUPLE OF THE JOY WORK WITH
AN INFECTION WERE PAINT
SO FAR WE'VE PUT PAINT ON A RAZOR BLADE AND I'M AN GLUE SO IT CAN BE DRYING
THAT WAY IN A PAGE IT'S A LOT OF LESS WEIGHT IN BULK AND FILTER I ENDED PAINT YOU CAN ISSUES IODINE TABLETS OUT TO MAKE SURE WATERS OF RECENTLY POSSIBLE
THERE IS PROFESSIONAL PAINT BALL IS THE FROM WAKE DOES NOT HAVE FLAG
IS THAT IT'S A SEVEN ON SEVEN SHOULD EVERYBODY IN THE DATA GRAB THEIR FLAG FOOT ON THE SIDE AND THERE'S RECREATIONAL PAINT BALL WHICH IS JUST LIKE FAMILIES COME IN ON YOUR SHOULD EACH OTHER A BIG PLAY CAPTIVE FLAGS OF LEAD THAT IT'S MOLD IT'S MAYLEE ELIMINATION
IN C OCCASIONALLY I PUT A COAT OF PAINT ON IT IS TO KEEP IT FRASCH
SO THE NEXT OPTION IS ON FOR PAPERS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IN A SPECIFIC COLOR THAT YOU'RE FLIPPING THE MAGAZINE CAN FINDER LOOKING AND PAPER STORING CAN'T FIND IS TO PAINT THE PAPER YOURSELF
YOU ARE GOING TO THE BACK OBVIOUSLY BUT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY QUOTES ON A PLAYER PAINT ALONG THE OUTER EDGES WE'VE SHOWN ARE WHICH WERE COVERED WITH MASKING TAPE
NOW THAT THE COAT OF BASS AND THAT I'VE PUT ON HAS DRIED I'M GOING TO GO HAND IN COLOR THE PICTURE FRAME WITH MY YELLOW ACRYLIC PAINT
SPIN ELECTION TINY THE SHOE YOU ALL THIS PAINT OUT OF THAT RIM OF WE SEE THE BACK OF THE SKIN
THE OTHER THING AND ONE A DO SPECIALLY SUCH AS WITH HIS BEAR WHERE WE KNOW THAT HAS BEEN PAINT THE BALL IS BROKEN AND IF YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU BRING ALL THAT DEBRIS OUT
DON'T SWIRL IT AROUND AND WIPE ALL THE PAINT ON TO YOUR PAPER TOWEL
SO GENERALLY ON THE FIRST FIRE YOU CONCENTRATE ON GETTING THE SHAPE OF YOUR PAINTING AN <UNK> AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO HAVE ALL THE HIGHLIGHTS WHERE YOU WANT HIM A AND B LIGHTNESS THAT YOU WANT HIM BECAUSE YOU CANNOT GO BACK AND AND PAINT ON TOP TO LIGHTEN LIKE YOU DO WITH OIL PAINT OR ACRYLIC PAINT
WE ARE GOING TO USE IS A PAINT STORE STICK TO STIR THIS AS IT STARTS KNOT
FILL WHAT EXCESS PAINT LAYING AROUND THE JOB SITE
NOW WE CAN KNOCK OUT THE GREEN BACKGROUND IN PHOTO SHOP OR ANOTHER PROGRAM BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH THIS WHITE SPACES WE HAVE TO PAINT A ROUND THE IMAGE SO THAT WE'D UM HAVE THIS BLEND INTO A SKIN TONE
FOR INSTANCE IF I WERE TO SELECT THE PAINT BRUSH AND THE EYEDROPPER TOOL I PROBABLY WOULDN'T TAKE A SKIN TONE SOMEWHERE IN THERE AND THEN ON AT A NEW LAYER AND PERHAPS BEGIN PAINTING LIKE THIS
ALRIGHT OUR IN A CURE THIS FACIAL ON DOWN BUT THAT'S HOW YOU PAINT THE EXTERIOR APHASIA ON THE EXTERIOR EAVES OF YOUR HOUSE
DEPENDING ON WHICH AGE OF KIDS AND HOW YOU WANT TO WORK THE PROJECT YOU CAN USE A PAINT BRUSH I CAN HAVE THEM SMEAR THE BLUE WITH THE FINGER
SINCE WE USED A COUPLE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAINT
BUT THE PAINT DRY IN THE GLUE DRY
IF YOU NEED TO DO A COUPLE COATS OF PAINT ON YOUR LIZARD ON YOU CAN DO THAT LET IT DRY AND COME BACK IN AND PAINTED OVER AGAIN
IF YOU PUT A MIME NEWSPAPER DRIVE WITH THIS KIND OF PAINT WITH THE ACRYLIC PAINT IF WHEN YOU LIFT AND NOT HIT THAT HAVE PIECES OF THAT NEWSPAPERS STOCK SIT HIM ON AND IT'S IN IT ONLY IN AND CREATE MORE OF A PROCESS FOR GOING BACK AND CLEANING OFF ON THE PAINTING A PAINTING OVER
NOW IF IT GETS PASS THESE THIS SECOND ON A DEFENSE DAY IN THAT HERE YOU'LL HAVE THE CENTER WHICH IS AGAIN IN THE CENTER IT WILL BE THE ONE THAT HOLDS THE PAINT DOWN IN IS IN THE MIDDLE ANYTHING THAT IS FAT THAT OUT OF THE FENCE IS HIS OR HER RESPONSIBILITY
AND I'M GONNA NEED PAINT TO MANY BRUSHES
WITH THE PAINT ON THE FABRIC ON FOR OUR DIY PANTS
CUT NICE A NICE SURFACE HERE THAT SMOOTH WILL HAVE CREASES THAT WE CAN PAINT ON FAN
OKAY OUR RED IT HE DID THE WORD AND PAINT ALL THE DOORS AND OUR IN A THE JAMS
SO NOW WE'VE GOT THAT CLEARED UP WE'RE TALKING TODAY ABOUT NINETEENTH CENTURY PAINT GLOUCESTER
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO THAT IS TO POSSIBLY ADJUST YOUR FOOT PLACEMENT OF WHITE PAINT YOU TELL THEM OR OFF THE BOARD
ONE OF MY GREAT IS JOY IS TEACHING WATERCOLOR PAINTING AND I HAVE A LOT OF SPOONS AND WHEN I'M VERY PLEASE THAT THEY WERE IN ON AN OWN TO PAINT IN THEIR OWN MANNER AND ENJOY THEIR LIVES
YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS PAINT REALLY GIVES A VERY THICK LAYER THAT WILL LET THE COLORS THAT YOU PUT ON TOP OF IT SHINE THROUGH
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT YOU SELECT THE CAULKING THAT'S PAINT LITTLE HAS A LOT OF THEM HAVE SILICONE IN THEM IN THE KNOT ANIMALS
