FIRST YOU GET THE SCALE AND THEN YOU GET THE CREATIVITY
THE PURPOSE OF LIKE YOU KNOW TRAINING IS NOT PERFECTION OF A MARTIAL SCALE BUT RATHER THE IMPROVEMENT OF ONCE CHARACTER
WE WANT TO GET THE DETAIL SO WE END UP DOING THEM AND SCALE AS WELL
MOVING OUR HAND BACK DOWN IN HALF POSITION AND A STRING LET'S LEARN IS B FLAT MAJOR SCALE STARTING WITH THE FIRST FINGER ON THE A STRING IS B FLAT I'M BEEN SEATED FOURTH FINGER I'M HOLDING D IN B FLAT ON THE END AND AN F RING TO NOTICE OR HAND DOESN'T CHANGE POSITION AT ALL AND YOU DECIDE THAT OPEN STRING IN THE MIDDLE AND B FLAT C AND D AND WE CAN GET A GOOD THING IS THAT WHEN YOU USE INTO AN EVEN CLOSE AND WHEN YOU THAT USING A <UNK>
I'M AND YOU NOTICE THE LOW I PUT THE NAMES OF THE ACTUAL NOTES IN THE SCALE SO YOU CAN SEE THEM BELOW AND YOU NOTICE I PUT A SQUARE AROUND THE ROUX E IN E AND THEN OUR FIFTH WHICH ISN'T B WHICH IS RIGHT HERE AND THE THIRD STRING SET
NOW ORGAN AND TAKE HIM VISUAL LOOK AT THE SCALE
IN THE MAJOR SCALE IN AND DOES THAT IN A MAJOR SCALE IS CAN BE SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS TAKE ALL OF THE THIRDS
IN ORDER TO MAKE A QUART MINOR WE TAKE OUR THIRD SCALE DEGREE WHICH WAS BEFORE AN F SHARP AND MAKE IT FLAT
IT'S A SEVEN NO SCALE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN AND START AGAIN ONE TWO THREE
AND FIFTEENTH AN ATHLETE SCALE HIGH EASILY SEE IS EASY ITEMS FIVE POINTS PATENT MIDDLE OF THE ROAD HANDS TEMPLATE AND THINGS THAT YOU AND EXTEND AND HAVE FIFTEEN POINTS
WE START RIGHT HERE IN A D FLAT MINOR A IN A D FLAT SCALE THAT'S WHY GREAT D FLAT
A LOT OF PEOPLE LEAVE THEIR FEET BEHIND AND AND MAKING IT ANOTHER SCALE EITHER BACK HANDSPRING
ON THE CONTRARY ON THE WEST COAST MANY CELLS PROFESSIONALS WHERE TIRE THAT WERE CLOSELY RESEMBLES A PROFESSIONAL GOLFER RATHER THAN A SCALE THREAT HAPPENS AND COLOR SHORTS ARE OFTEN CONSIDERED DRESSED UP
YOUR WINTER HANDS FLAT IN ONE OF OUR JOB OR WHETHER PLAIN SCALE IN FORT YOU'RE PLANNING CHORD YOU WON A CERTAIN LITTLE ARCH AND WITH YOUR PICKING HAND YOU SIMPLY WANNA BE ABLE TO HIS STRUM DOWN WHERE FOR PICKING THEM YOU WANT YOUR HAND VERY RELAX YOUR ARM RESTED OVER LIKE OVER THIS OR EVEN IF THERE'S NOT A CONTRARY WITH IT'S A STRAIGHT IN ONE HAND REACHING OVER THAT WHERE YOUR TRACK IS OVER THE PICK UPS
NOW WHEN DEFINITION OF SAYS INVENTED IN USAGE THAT WE REMOVE THE THIRD AND REPLACE IT WITH THE SECOND NOTE OF THE MAJOR SCALE
IF IT WERE NOT SENSUAL IT WOULD NOT BE WORKING OR THE SHAPES OF THE LETTERS IN THE WAVE FORM THE LETTERS WOULD NOT BE WORKING WITH THE WEIGHT AND WE ARE DESIGNED AS PEOPLE AS HUMAN BEINGS SO YES IT HAS ESSENTIAL NATURE YES IT TAKES SCALE AND THE STUDYING OF THE SCALE HAS TO COME FIRST
HI I'M TO BASICALLY DENIM NEAR THE MAJOR EXERCISES HERE IN A MINUTE KEY TO SEEK A NEW WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE A ROOM AND GO THROUGH ALL THE FINGERING SIGNET THING THAT'S ON THE FIRST ONE I'M IN A DO IS IN THE G ON THE SECOND EXERCISE IN A GOOD THE BEGINNING OF THE WITH THE OF WITH THE OF MAJOR SCALE SO LOOKING AT MY KEYS WE JUST GO OUT WITH SEEING THE STONE AND SEE A GOOD E FLAT THE D F E FLAT G F A G B FLAT A C B FLAT THE C TO THAT JUST GOT TO DO THE WHOLE CYCLE OF SECONDS GOING THROUGH THAT AND I'LL JUST PLAY FOR A REAL THAT
IF SO OUT WITH THAT I'M ACTUALLY USE A KNOT NOTES OF THE D MINOR SCALE
IF YOU'RE PLAYING A C COLOR TO IT YOU KNOW YOU'RE PLAYING A C CHORD IF YOU'RE PLAYING A C STAY ON THEN YOU KNOW THAT ARE PLAYING A C SCALE
IF YOU LOOK AT IT ON A SCALE OF COSTUMES IS LEADER RIGHT IS HOLDING AND THEN COME QUEENS AND AND BE OR GELS WHICH ARE YOUR HEAVIES HOLD
AND GET IT SORT OF A HIGHER SCALE EITHER LOW THAT LOWER SCALE THAT YOU CAN ON SUBTLE ACHIEVERS OF YOUR ON HER CHIN WHILE TOO MUCH <UNK> FROM THESE
AGAIN LOOKING AT OUR SCALE DEGREES WE'VE GOT ONE THAT IS OUR D FIND OUR A MINUTE ANOTHER D DOWN HERE AND NOW I'VE GOT OUR FLAT THREE THERE
JUST KIND OF AS A RECAP REMEMBER HOW IMPORTANT YOUR HEAD POSITION IS FOR EVERY SCALE
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THAT ON THE GUITAR RESTART FROM THE G IN TO THE SECOND NOTE OF THE MAJOR SCALE FEATHERED KNOWN TO THE THINNER THING KNOWN
AS WE JUST DISCUSSED THE FLOOR THROUGH NOTE OF A MAJOR SCALE AND THUS THE DISTANCE FROM THE FIRST NOTE OF A MAJOR SCALE TO THE FOURTH NOTE OF A MAJOR SCALE YOU WOULD REFER TO THAT INTERVAL AS A PERFECT FOURTH RATHER THAN A MANGER FOURTH
NO NOTICE THAT THERE'S NO DIMINISHED FOR WITH OUR MINOR FOURTH BECAUSE THIS NO IN WITH THE SAME AS THE THIRD NOTE OF THE MAJOR SCALE SINCE THERE'S ONLY A HALF STEP BETWEEN THE THIRD NOTE IN THE FIFTH NOTE OF A MAJOR SCALE
NOW START SPINNING AN EMPLOYEE ARMS IN TIGHT YOU KNOW SHINGLE ROUND REALLY FAST SCALE
THERE IS A GREAT DEAL MONEY TO BE MADE IN THIS FIELD BECAUSE IT'S VERY THAT GOT MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD AT THIS PARTICULAR SCALE SO IF YOU FIND YOURSELF BILLY PASSIONATE FEELING PASSION ABOUT DRAWING THESE TYPES OF UP ON THE EDGES THEN ABSOLUTELY GO FOR THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS THE BULLET YOUR PORTFOLIO IN AND JUST A MINUTE TO DIFFERENT EITHER AGENCIES OR ACTUAL PUBLISHERS OR ANIMATED HOW'S IT THEMSELVES
A <UNK> IN A YOUNG THE DOWN IS THE FLAT MINOR THAT A FLAT SEVEN ON THE ACTIVE PLANT F MAJOR OVER BECAUSE THAT'S ADDED THE FLAT MAJOR SCALE AND THAT REALLY IS IN A CLASH OF THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE WE REALLY IN AND ACTUALLY F MAJOR FOR THE WHOLE SAW
ON MELODICALLY WERE LOOK AT CLEMATIS IS ON AND THINGS THAT OUT A LITTLE MORE DISSONANT MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE OF A MAJOR SCALE BUT THAT ARE IMPORTANT CAN LEARN HOW TO PLAY THE STOUT KNEES
THIRD HIGHEST NOTE OF THE SCALE DOWN THREE NOTES HAND HACK IN ONE HAND IN ON A NON INTO THAT AND WE CONTINUE THAT FASHION DO WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SCALE AGAIN
WE GO SO THE HIGHEST NOTE OF THE SCALE AND GO DOWN THREE NOTES CROW HI RENT RID OF THE SECOND HEISNER THE SCALE AND GO DOWN THREE NOTES WHEN AND PAT HAND
WE CALL A GOOD DOWN THREE METHOD WHEN IT STARTED THE TOP OF THE SCALE WORK OUR WAY DOWN
AND THE OTHER WIRE AND NEXT WE NEED TO TAKE CAULK SCALE
SO GETTING YOURSELF A SCALE IF IF THE CAN SEE EXACTLY HOW MUCH YOU'RE FEEDING YOUR DOG
IN OUR FIVE SEVEN CHORD COMES OUT OF OR MAJOR RATE SOPHIA B C D E F E D C IS THE ONE MAJOR SCALE THAT WE WE ARE DEALER IT UP AND BE IN IS START ON THE FIFTH DEGREE ANGLE AT OUR F SEVENTH SCALE
WE HAVE OUR THAT TWO MINOR THEY'RE FLAT SIX LETTER WORDS CAN UTILIZE THAT SAME SCALE PATTERN OR A MINOR PATTERN IN WITH THE ROOT
IF YOU DON'T FIND OUT MORE INFORMATION OR THE EXACT MEMBERS OF A SCALE A CHECK MY WEBSITE STUDIO GUERRILLA DOT COM AND I HAVE LINKS TO THE AMERICAN FEDERATION MUSICIANS WEBSITE AND SO THAT YOU CAN BELOW FOR THE RESEARCH ON YOUR OWN
IT'S NOT MUCH MORE THAN LIMITED PRESSING OR DEMO SCALE BUT THAT WAY YOU CAN GO OUT SO AS MANY CUP IS A LOT OF YOUR PROJECT
