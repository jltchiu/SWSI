ALSO I WANNA SOME SOME PRACTICE WITH IT BUT I ALSO ON EXPERT VILLAGE I'M A GREAT GOT ACQUITS OBJECT THAT OUT
ANOTHER THING THAT YOU CAN USE ARE THESE SOFT HIGH ON THE THEIR SOLD IN CRAFT STORES TO ACTUALLY MAKE RUBBER STAMPS OUT I'M BY HEATING A METAL OBJECT AND PUSHING IT ON THERE UNTIL IT FORMS A IMAGE
CERTAINLY WITH THE DANCES NOSE NOTORIOUS FOR AS THE HANDRAIL WHICH IS AN OBJECT THAT WE USE TYPICALLY TO REMOVE CAVITIES ASSAM TIMES REMOVAL OF FILLINGS OR TO DO IN COSMETIC PREPARATIONS ON TEA THERE IF EVEN THINGS LIKE OR MOVING BONE AROUND TEETH
IF YOU HAVE A SMALL SHARP OBJECT CAN AND PICK SOME OF THOSE THINGS OUT AND THEN OUT INFLATE YOU'RE NEW TO A LITTLE LITTLE AIR AND REINSTALL YOUR VALVES THEM FIRST CLIP IT IF LAUREN HERE WITH THE TIRE
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A LARGE OF MASON JAR LIKE OBJECT OF SOME SORT
OKAY IN THE LAST SEGMENT WE LEARNED THAT USING ENGLISH DOES NOT HELPLESS CONTROL THE DIRECTION THAT A CUE BALL COMES OFF OF AN OBJECT BALL AT AN ANGLE
IN ADDITION PIERCINGS ARE INCREDIBLY POPULAR UP ON THE IN PUNK FASHION ADDED THE USE OF EVERYDAY OBJECT AS G
THEY PAINTING ON PIECES STEEL THAT THEY WANT LOCATER PATTERN DOWN AND THEN THEY'LL USE ON A METAL SCRIBE OR SHARP OBJECT AND THEY'LL SCRIBE THROUGH THE PAINT ON TO THE STEEL
WE'RE DOING IS MAKING A SMALL OBJECT DISAPPEARED BY WAY OF THE FRENCH DROP
AS IT'S TOO BIG OF AN OBJECT TO WORK FOR SOMETHING WITH A SMALLER PRACTICE UP TO THAT
SITE SWAPS IS NOTATION WHERE EACH NUMBER CORRESPONDS THE HOW LONG THE OBJECT IS IN THE AIR
IT BUT THAT PRESSURE THERE IS A STEADY PRESSURE OR YOU CAN DO A ROCKING MOTION HIS BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH THAT'S ONE INCH OBJECTS TO THIS WILL HAPPEN SOMETIMES WITH YOUR ANIMAL THAT THEY'LL OBJECT TO A POINT
YOUR OBJECT BALL STARTS RIGHT IN THE CENTER THE TABLE
THE OBJECT OF SOLDER IS TO POSSESS THE WALL AND WORK IT DOWN THE FIELD ORDER THE SCORE A GOAL
AN OBJECT GRAFFITI ON THE MECHANICAL AND WILL PLAY THIS AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM HIM HAIRED ALONE OF THIS ACTORS FOR FOOTAGE
MY SCENTED MOOD OF ALL LIZZY THAT YOU DO THE OBJECT
A LOT IS INTO THE OBJECT
LIKE THE OBJECT FIRST YOUR PRIMARY SURFACES DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANNA HIGH LIKE THE REFLECTIONS OR WHETHER YOU WANNA CONCENTRATE ON THE OVERALL SHAPE
USING EVERYDAY OBJECT AND MAKING IT JEWELRY WAS ANOTHER WAY THAT THE PUNK SORT OF OUR ANTI CONSUMERISM MADE FUN OF THE IDEA OF THE OF SPENDING ON THINGS LIKE JEWELRY
BECAUSE OF ITS SLIDES STRAIGHT INTO THE OBJECT BALL WHICH COULD HAPPEN IS THE CUE BALL THE ANY IMPART ALL OF ITS ENERGY TO THE OBJECT BALL SENDING THE OBJECT BALL ON ITS WAY IN THE CUE BALL THE LOSE EVERYTHING HAS GOT ROOM FOR IN ITS THOSE STOPPED AND STUFF
AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF AN ACTION DO WE NEED TO HAVE ON THE CUE BALL ON CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT BALL IN ORDER TO GET IT TO STOP
IT'S A FAVORITE TOOL OF MY NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH WORK I NEED TO DO WITH IT BUT ALSO JUST BECAUSE AS A TOOL AS AN OBJECT IT HAPPENS TO BE VERY LOVELY VERY BEAUTIFUL
THIS IS MY LAST OBJECT BALL IN THE TABLE
STAY ENGAGED AND REACHING REACHING AND REACHING AND THEN THE OBJECT IS JUST TO HOLD THIS
YOU WON'T HAVE A COMFORTABLY OF AN HENNA LOOSE AND NONE OF THE ARE GONNA SLOW PITCHES YOU KNOW A SIX TO TEN FEET ON THE END OF YOU KNOW THE OBJECT OF THE YOU KNOW SLOPE IT'S IS JUST NOTED MAKING SURE THAT YOU PUT IT IN A POSITION WHERE THESE BATTERS YOU KNOW A EITHER NERVES GROUND OUTS OR BE OUT POP IT UP FOR CD YOU KNOW THAT YOU STRIKE OUT
TODAY WE'RE TALKING A LITTLE BIT OF THAT HOW TO SHOOT OVER AN OBJECT BALL
ANYWAY INCLUSIONS WHIPPING STATION HOPEFULLY BEFORE TOO LONG WILL HAVE THE SNOUT ON THE GOOD STUFF IT AND MOVE ON IS THE OTHER PART OF THIS OBJECT
AND IF I WAS GOOD BECOME A PIG ASIDE UNLESS AN OBJECT MOST OF THE IN TOTAL DARKNESS SO CAN PICK A SIDE IT WITH A SHOT OF A GOAL LIKE I'M DOING HERE
NOW IN AND DO IS DRAW THE EYES BUT WHAT WE CAN DRAW A AS WE NEED TO DRAW A LINE THROUGH THE CENTER IN IS A CURVE LAB AND IT IS GOING AROUND THE CURVE OBJECT
THAT'S ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO DO BECAUSE THIS IS NOT LIKE A FLAT OBJECT IN OR HOW IT LOOKS OF THE LINES HAFTA ADD THAN FLOW AND FOLLOW ALONG IN DIFFERENT AREAS
BUT IF YOU GOTTA FULCRUM IN THE MIDDLE AND YOUR DISTANCES MINOR IT'S A LOT EASIER TO CLOCHE WOULD THEN OR MOVE THAT OBJECT
