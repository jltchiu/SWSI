WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INTERMEDIATE FLOOR GYMNASTICS AND WE'VE COVERED ARE STRETCHING AND OUR WARM UPS TO AVOID INJURY AND THE NEXT THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS WAS YOUR YOUR BODY POSITIONS ON MAINLY YOUR HEAD POSITION
WHAT IS WANTED TO SHOW YOU SOME OF THE BASIC SKILLS AND WHERE YOUR HEAD POSITION IS ON THOSE SKILLS
IT SHOULD STAY IN THAT KIND OF TUCK POSITION THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH
THE FADER HAND CENTER WET HEEL KICK UP AN STAY DOWN IN THAT SAME TUCK POSITION
THE MORE OF TRAFFIC CHANGED <UNK> THAT I CAN GET WITH WHOM SUPPLIES AND COME IN WITH A HALF OF WORK HIS NOSE USE COTTON GOING GO NOW JUMPER WAY WING ALL RIGHT HERE GRUNT UNDERNEATH SOME OF THE BACK OF THE HAND FOUR FINGERS HERE FOR POWER IN OREGON RULE OR GRABS A FEW ON TOP STEP BACK WITH THE LITTLE LIGHT FOR POWER IN A CIRCLE COOL HIS LIKE ERICA BROKEN ADDRESS LATER IN EXCEL POSITION THE DROPS OF HAUNCHES
THERE WE GO SO NOW SHOW OF COVERAGE A MOMENT THEM A LITTLE BIT NIA INSIDE POSITION TO FINISH WITH FUN
KEEP YOUR SPINE IN NEUTRAL POSITION BY USING YOUR ABDOMINAL MUSCLES
OUT AS FAR AS THE BAR CHORDS REALLY DO THE SAME POSITION AS WE DID IN THE PREVIOUS WITH A IN A SHARP FIRST FINGER SEVENTH FRET WHICH IS THE THIRD FINGER NINTH FRET FOURTH FINGER ALSO NINTH FRET AND THEN THE OTHER MIDDLE FINGER OF COURSE ON THE EIGHTH FRET
I'M SHOWING THIS IN THE DIFFERENT POSITION
YOU GET YOURSELF SET AT FIRST INTO A LUNGE POSITION
SO I'M STARTING AT SIX UP POSITION
THIS POSITION IS COLOR CHAMBER POSITION
STARTING POSITION YOUR GENERAL ALL FOUR FINGERS IN AND BRING YOUR THUMBS OVER YOUR INDEX AND MIDDLE FINGER PLACING YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HIP BONE
THIS UNITY WORKING ADD TWISTING POSITION AND SQUATTING DOWN IN STANDING UP
SO NOW IS A REALLY GOOD POSITION
COME BACK TO CENTER POSITION
YOU CAN HOLD THIS POSITION ABOUT FIVE TO TEN SECONDS
WHERE ME GET IT IN TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S THE POSITION THAT FROM THAT POSITION FOR YOU NOW IT'S A PRESS PLAY
THERE ARE A COUPLE WAYS TO MOUNT A VINING'S BUT THE STANDARD WAY TO DO IT IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE FORWARD POSITION SET IN THE BACK FOOT AND CAUSES OF THREE DEGREE ANGLE AND FRONT FOOT OF POSITIVE FIFTEEN DEGREE ANGLE
IT A DIFFERENT TYPES OF WITH EVEN DO IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS PIGEON FOOTED AN ANGLE THE BINDINGS FACING IN TOWARDS EACH OTHER DUCK FOOTED AN ANGLE THE EYE THINGS AWAY FROM EACH OTHER FORWARD WHICH IS THE STANDARD WAY TO DO IT OR YOU CAN ALSO SET UP IN THE ALPINE OR RACING POSITION WHICH IS AN EXTREME FORM OF THE FLOOR POSITION WEIGHTED BALL CLIMBING AND ALMOST WANT A MOUNTAIN PARALLEL WITH THE BOARD AND NOW ONCE YOU DETERMINE THE WAY ONE ARRIVES TO INSERT A HARDWARE ARE ALSO
OKAY SO TO GET TO THE NECK FOR HER ARM TO REITERATE OF A MOVEMENT OFF OF I WANT TO THINK OF ALL RIGHT FOOT LEFT FOOT RIGHT FOOT LEFT FOOT AT WHICH IS A GOOD POSITION TO GO THREE STAFF UNDERGO LEFT RIGHT LEFT
FOR ME OF BRAKE LEVER POSITIONS LOT MORE CRITICAL THAN SHIFTER POSITION AND BECAUSE HE BREAKS ARE IN THE MOST IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ARSENIC COMES DULA CONTROLLING THE BIKE
THESE ARE THE EXACT SAME WAY AS A SIX THEN THINGS UP POSITION GUNS ON THE SUNLIGHT FIFTH
YOU WANT A GRIP THE RINGS SO THAT THE FINGER SPINNING ON IN MY CASE IT'S AND MIDDLE FINGER IS ALREADY IN POSITION TO ACCEPT THE RINGS
AND I'M A PUSH PULL IT OVER INTO THIS POSITION HERE WHERE THE SHADOW IS THE STRONGEST
AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE TRYING TO CONTROL THE SPEED TO COME BACK AND JUST GENTLY NURSE IT UP IN FROM THE POCKET SO THAT WE GET IT IN TO EASY SCORING POSITION SO THAT WE CAN GO BACK AND FORTH ONCE AGAIN
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT MELODIC POSITION IS IN FRONT OF THE HAIR THAT I'M ACTUALLY CUTTING
THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS YOU GRAB THE ARM WITH BOTH OF YOUR ARMS AND YOU DROP YOUR WEIGHT DOWN INTO THE HORSE STANCE RIGHT AWAY FORCES THE PERSON DOWN TO OUR POSITION FOR THEM TO MAINTAIN THEIR WHOLE
AND THEN WHEN YOU ARE LOCKED IN THIS POSITION IT'S BEST TO LOCK BECAUSE THAT WAY YOU DON'T THROUGH KNOTS HEARING THE LOCK WITH YOUR WHEELS AGAINST THE COPING
ONE OF THE TRICKS THAT STILL HAVE TO LEARN BEFORE DOING THE FAKIE OLLIE DISASTER IS YOU'LL NEED TO KNOW HOW IT FEELS THAT HAVE YOUR BACK WHEELS ABOVE THE TRANSITION AND ABLE TO GET OUT FROM THIS POSITION
IT'S EASY TO GET INTO THIS POSITION BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS BY ROLLING BACKWARDS WITH TOO MUCH SPEED AND YOU END UP LOCKING OVER
ON YOU WOULDN'T PEEL IT FEELS LIKE TO MOVE FROM THE VERY BOTTOM WITH YOUR ARM UP IN THE FRONT POSITION WHAT LIFT THE TIP
HAMSTRING CURL IN A PRONE POSITION WORKING EIGHT TO TEN REPS FOR BEGINNERS TEN TWELVE AND UP ONE TO THREE SETH
YOU WANT TO COME UP BACKWARDS RIGHT BEFORE YOU GET TO THE BAR YOU WANT TO PUT ALL THE WAY ON YOUR BACK FOOT SLAMMING A TAIL HER INTO THE PLATFORM NEW WHEELS AND FROTH INTO THE CUP AND GIVING IS LONG IN POSITION IT SHOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WHEN YOU DO A ROCK
THINGS I THINK ABOUT WHEN I POSITION MY TILES IS STARTING WITH CORNERS
SEE ONE JUST POSITION IF YOU WOULD A TIME AND THEN GLUE THEM DOWN
SO IT'S ARM THE MYSTERY JUST SITTING HERE WHAT I'M DOING BUT LIKE IT IS EVEN IDEAL POSITION
AND THE MAJOR THING I KEEP COMING BACK TO OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT DISTRIBUTION WEIGHT THE SERVER THINK ON THE TACK POSITION WHICH IS NOT JUST LIKE IN SKIING WHERE LIKE THEM PARALLEL SHOULDERS SQUARED OFF TO THE HEALTH OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING FOR IN A CAN MAGICALLY
TO DO NEXT DON'T STOP WE'RE LOOKING AT THE F AND SEE SO FOR OUR SECOND POSITION ON THE NOLLIE YOU'RE STARTING IN SECOND ON THE D STRING AND OF SINKING SLANT OF TIME TO HIDE HANDS AND THE SEAT IS SHORTER CROSSING AXIS IS GETTING A CHANCE TO LIMPLY DOUBLE STOP WHERE YOUR FIRST FINGER IS GOING TO PRACTICE I'M HOLDING DOWN TWO STRINGS AT ONCE ON THE FINGER PAD AND HALF
GET STARTED FROM A FIGHTING POSITION OKAY THERE'S TWO WAYS TO DO IT
SO YOU'RE GOING ACTUALLY HUNT FOR THE BEST POSITION
IF YOU WANTED TO CUT THE BALL TO THE LEFT AND A CUTTER FASTBALL YOU POSITION FINGERS ON TO THE LEFT HALF A BALL TO CREATE SPAN AND MOVEMENT THAT WOULD MAKE THE BALL BASICALLY CURVE TO THE RIGHT
IF YOU WANT A CUT THE BALL TO THE RIGHT IN YOUR RIDING A PITCHER YOU CUT THE BALL IN HALF AND POSITION BOTH FINGERS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF A BALL
WE WANNA MAKE SURE TO BE SOLID IN POSITION
SO IT LAUNCHES THE MAN USES THE FADE TO THE RAMP AT THE TOP OF THE RAMP LITTLE ROCK STEP RIGHT HERE AND AS HE MOVES BACK UP TO THE TOP OF THE RAMP ANOTHER ROCKS STAY UP ANY OPENS BACKUP ENDING IN A BASIC JUST LIKE WE LEARNED IN THE FIRST POSITION FOR ME AND IN THE POSE ROUTINE
NOW AN ADVANTAGE YOU CAN ALSO CLOSE YOUR EYES AND IS GOOD TO THE CORRECT POSITION AND YOU FEEL THE RIGHT POSITION
GO AHEAD AND FILL THE CORRECT POSITION
BALL COMES OFF THE RIM ITS POSITION FIRST CONTRACT FORCE TO MAKE SURE IT FEEL THE OTHER GUY FORCE AND THEN YOU GO FOR THE BALL
AND IF YOU USUALLY HAVE SOMETHING IN YOUR HEAD SET YOUR CHIN STARTS IN ANCIENT HAVE POSITION GO AHEAD AND REMOVE THAT NOW
WE'RE JUST TAKE IT GO UP IF YOU WORK IN SOMETHING AT THE TOP OF YOUR SHOE IN AND JUST PRACTICE THAT POSITION
REMEMBER THAT UNIT IS POSITION RIGHT ONE FOR THE SHOULDER BACK TO SHOULDER FLOOR HAD PRESSING UP
WHEN A RIGHT ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP AND AS YOU REACH THE CLIMAX YOU'LL PULL ROUND INTO A FRONT TUCK STAY IN THAT HAD POSITION UNTIL YOU LAND
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF WE ARE IN IS THE SEASONING REFLECT POSITION THE ON THE LESSON WITHOUT FROM THE BOTTOM DID IT UP
THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN CREATE THE STRENGTH IN BALANCE AND THEN WILL WORK UP THE BODY REALIGNING AGAIN IN ANATOMICAL POSITION THAT YOU CAN START TO RELY NEW SKELETAL STRUCTURE
SO THIS TIME WE POSITION OURSELVES WITHIN GLIDE OF THE LANDING FIELD THAT IT'S A LITTLE FURTHER AHEAD OF US IF WE HAVE ROOM TO ADD POWER
AGAIN START THE POSITION OPTIONAL WITH THE WEIGHT
SOLE PETLAND DOWN IN THAT POSITION
AS MY BODY COMES POSITION THE SWORD COMES IN POSITION
IAN AND YOU HAVE BEEN THE SKIN AND IN THAT YOU JUST HAVE THEM INTO THE AND WHEN YOU PUT THE BALL WHEN YOU'RE IN A CERTAIN POSITION AND YOU PUT THEM ALL OF THEIR OFF OF THE GLASS IT'S KINDA OF THEM COME IN AND BOUNCE INTO THE ON TO THE RIM NOW AND THERE'S MANY <UNK>
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOU KEEP YOUR ARMS AT A LOCK POSITION IT OFF COMES IN ON THE GROUND
STEP THREE <UNK> IN A SQUAT POSITION
SOFTEN SIX UP POSITION HERE
WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING A GOOD SQUAT YOUR CORE IS REALLY HOLDING YOUR BODY INTO POSITION CORRECTLY
YOU'RE ACTUALLY UNITS THIGH AND SQUAT POSITION WHEN YOU'RE A IN THE FRONT OF A
AND REALLY GOOD WAY TO LEARN AT AN EXIT FROM THE FIFTY FIFTY GRINDS WORTH LEARN ON ALL THE AND OF LENGTH IS IS SOMETIMES IS SET UP YOUR WORK ON A LEDGE OR CURVE SAFELY IF ENDS FIFTH AND JUST WORK ON FALLING OUT OF THE POSITION
IF YOU TRY TO DO THIS OUT ONCE IT'S REALLY EASY IN THIS MOTION THE TRICK TO FALL OFF IN THE AND GET OUT OF POSITION
YOU GOTTA BE ABLE TO LAY ANY NUMBER POSITION THAT ANY GIVEN ON
HALF VOLLEY ON TO THE TOP HALF FOLD THE MANUAL POSITION IF AND IT JUST BEFORE YOU GET TO THE END INSTEAD OF ROLLING STRAIGHT OFF OF A FRONT SIDE ONE EIGHTY FEET
WHAT WE DO THIS IS TO CATCH SET UP AN ANNUAL POSITION SO THAT YOUR BODY'S TURN THIS BEFORE <UNK>
ONE IS WHEN HIS GUARD PULLS OUT LAMP LAGER POSITION WHEN HE PULLS OUT STOP WE PULL THAT GUARD POSITION AND BELIEVE OF BIG HOLE OPEN ON THIS SIDE
NOW NOTICE NOW HE AND THEY'RE NOT OUT TO THE THINNER I GIVE THAT NOT A CORRECT BODY POSITION
ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR SKIS MOUNTED IN YOUR IN THE WATER IS GOING TO BE LAYING BACK WITH THE SKIS PARALLEL KNEES BENT UP TO YOUR CHEST ROPE AT THE PROPER HAND POSITION IN BETWEEN THE SKIS
AND AS THEY DO LET THEM RELAX AND AS WITH MOST YOU FEEL TENSION LIGHTEN UP UNDERNEATH AND LET THAT PERSON RELAX AND YOU CAN DO THEIR HEAD BACK AND POSITION AND MAINTAIN THAT SAME PRESSURING THAT SAME SPOT AS YOU HOLD THAT HEAD UP
IN THIS SEGMENT I'M IN A TALK ABOUT AN EXTREMELY CRUCIAL ASPECT OF PLAYING THAT MANY PEOPLE TAUGHT OVER THE YEARS DON'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AND THAT'S HOW YOU HOLD THE GUITAR AND THE POSITION YOUR BODY SCENT
THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO START BECAUSE THEY CAN UTILIZE THE SUPPORT OF SIDE WALKERS EASIER AS WELL AS THEIR LEGS DON'T HAVE TO BE IN THE DOWN POSITION TO BE ABLE TO RIDE
AND IT DOESN'T HAVE YOU MESS UP OR YOU WANT A SWITCH POSITION TO ALWAYS IMMUNE L STRIKE
KEEPING THE CHEST AND BODY IN A GOOD UPRIGHT POSITION
SO IT'LL SOUND LIKE THIS HAND ADD WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS POSITION PROPERLY HAND HAS HELPED TO SOUND
YOU WON'T BE MINDFUL OF YOU WANT A NO OF WHAT'S UP ABOVE YOU BEFORE YOU JUST TAKE YOUR WET IT JUST INTERESTED PUT IN POSITION GET YOU MIGHT FIND <UNK> THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO DO IT WITHOUT DAMAGING SOMETHING
AND FROM HERE IS WHAT YOU HAVE FOR AGAIN VERY OUR SHOULDERS OVER OUR WRISTS DEFINE ANNEALING PLANK POSITION
AND THEN TO FINE CHATTER RUMBA IN THE KNEELING POSITION IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE FULL POSITION WILL SHIFT SLOWLY FORWARD LOWERING THEIR ELBOWS TIGHT TO THE BODY
THEY MAY MOVE THEN A FIRE BACK ON ME THIS IS I HAVE NOT OVER COMMITTED ON A GOOD POSITION
SO START MY REGULAR SIX FOR POSITION I DRAW MY LEFT FOOT IN AND NICE THAT TO THE SIDE ONE TWO
PRETEND THERE'S A STRING ON A REGULAR THIS STRAIGHT OUT AND THEN RELEASE IT BACK TO NEUTRAL POSITION
START TEST IT CAN BE A NEUTRAL POSITION
IS YOUR CHILD IN THE POSITION OF LIFE WHERE HOME SCHOOL BENEFIT DOWN

IN HOLD THIS POSITION FIVE TO TEN SECONDS
WHICH ARE HOLD THIS POSITION FOR FIVE TO TEN SECONDS
WHEN YOU'RE IN THIS POSITION THIS IS ABOUT A DEEP DESIGNED TO GO
YOU WANT TO LOWER BACK IN THE BOTTOM POSITION TO HAVE A NICE LONG OR HURT TO IT
THEY'RE MORE PEOPLE THAT CAN HURT BY MOVING IN THIS MOTION FROM A HYPER EXTENDED POSITION THEN I CARE TO THINK ABOUT
SET UP FOR THE FOOT IN AN OLLIE POSITION EXCEPT IT'S ON THE WORDS THAT ISN'T ABLE TO GET MAXIMUM ABILITY IS AN OLLIE AND FIGHT
NOT A HALF THAT KICK THAT IS WHEN YOU ARE HIGH IN AN OLLIE POSITION THE OLLIE ONE EIGHTY THREAT FRONTSIDE AND LAND FAKIE AND ROLLING
AND WHICH IT AND IT WAS FIFTH THAT WAS THOUGHTS AND CONTINUE UP THE WORD AND FLIP THE FOURTH ONE EIGHTY IF CUT AT <UNK> AND IN THE FAKIE POSITION

IT'S ACTUALLY THE POSITION THAT YOU CAN BE GOING INTO
AS YOU MOVE TO THE SQUAT RACK STARTING OFF WITH A GOOD EVEN AND POSITION ON THE BAR
THE BAR AND GOOD PROPER POSITION ACROSS THE UPPER BACK AND LOWER FOR THE SHOULDER
WHEN YOU GET COMFORTABLE IN THIS POSITION TO SIMPLY LIFT JOURNEY OUT AND PLACE YOUR FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER
NOW MAKE SURE THAT YOUR ELBOW IS IN LINE WITH YOUR SHOULDER AND THEN ONCE YOU GET INTO THIS POSITION YOU CAN MODIFY BY KEEPING YOUR KNEE DOWN AND THEN HAVE THAT OTHER LATE FULLY EXTENDED
