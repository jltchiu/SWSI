H2q3JOMMNCQ_11 0 SOME PEOPLE WILL DIP PIECES INTO A CLEAR GLAZE AND OTHER CHOOSE TO PAINT IT ON
H2q3JOMMNCQ_12 0 I REALLY LIKE THE NON-ABRASIVENESS OF DIPPING BECAUSE REALLY YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING THE PIECES A WHOLE LOT AND WHEN YOU ARE PAINTING YOUR CLEAR GLAZE ON WHAT CAN HAPPEN IS AS SOON AS THE PIECE GETS WET YOU REACTIVATE THE PAINT AND WHEN A PAINT IS REACTIVATED IT'S VERY EASY FOR YOU TO START MOVING IT WHEN YOU ARE BRUSHING IT ON
H2q3JOMMNCQ_15 0 WE ONLY DIP HALF A PIECE AT A TIME SO AS TO NOT DISTURB THE PAINT UNDERNEATH

gupPatBYC4I_5 0 IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE STICK GETS PAINT ON IT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE INSERTED INTO THE MILK CARTON
gupPatBYC4I_1 0 NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PAINT THE STYROFOAM BALL MEANING THAT THE STYROFOAM BALL IS GOING TO BE SITTING AT PRETTY MUCH IT'S GOING TO BE THE CENTER OF THE WINDMILL WHERE ALL THE ARMS ARE GOING TO BE HANGING

GY4xUx9YR60_13 0 NOW I'M GOING TO TAKE MY SLIP SIMPLY PAINT IT ON ALL THE SPOTS TAKE THE TOP SIDE OF MY HANDLE AND PRESS IT AGAINST THE MUG LIKE SO
GQefb82rktc_3 0 AND THE MORE TIME IT TAKES TO PAINT A PAINTING THE LESS INCOME BASICALLY
GQefb82rktc_5 0 AND AS YOU'LL SEE ON THIS PIECE HERE WHICH I'VE ALREADY LAID OUT THERE'S A NUMBER OF VERY INTRICATE DETAILS ON THIS THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME AN EXTRAORDINARILY LONG TIME TO ACTUALLY PAINT
HcXjjA9Fcxw_13 0 ACRYLIC PAINT IS A GREAT ALL PURPOSE PAINT FOR CRAFTS
GAbc4MyyZyo_7 0 THERE'S BEEN SOME PAINT BLOWN OUT THE LAST TIME IN THIS ONE THAT'S MIXED INTO THE OIL

HE5tiPfCQIo_3 0 HERE WHAT WE ARE DOING IS TAPING OFF THE MOLDING WHERE YOU DON'T WANT TO PAINT
HE5tiPfCQIo_5 0 SO YOU REALLY WANT TO PAINT TO ABOUT AN 1/4 OF INCH AWAY FROM YOUR TAPE LINE AND THEN FINISH THAT PART WITH THE BRUSH
HE5tiPfCQIo_4 0 WHAT THEY DO WHEN THEY ARE PAINTING WITH THE ROLLER IS THE TEMPTATION TO GO AND PAINT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TAPE LINE WHEN YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THE MORE PAINT YOU PUT ON THE TAPE YOU CREATE A SEAL SO THAT WHEN YOU PULL THE TAPE BACK YOU WIND UP PULLING THE PAINT AND MESSING UP A LOT OF GOOD WORK
HE5tiPfCQIo_6 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO USE SMOOTH EASY STROKES AND BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVER PAINT YOUR PREPARATION LINE
G_u8rvAVSCk_20 0 IT WILL CLEAN THE PAINT OFF THE CAR IF YOU CATCH IT FAIRLY SOON
GpkmlwtEoTk_9 0 WHEN THE PAPER IS HOT ON A GRIDDLE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TOUCH THAT WAX BLOCK YOU SEE AND YOU CAN DIRECTLY PAINT WITH THE WAX
gdtbeY84CPM_8 0 IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TELL WITH BLACK BECAUSE YOUR PAINT BRUSH BEING BLACK IT IS HARDER TO TELL HOW MUCH PAINT YOU'VE GOT ON THERE
gkYaBjdyHCs_6 0 THAT IS WHY I CHOSE TO USE THE METALLIC PAINT
H9eXrX31IJk_8 0 YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH SIDE OF THE FOIL YOU WANT TO USE BUT I LIKE TO USE THIS SIDE BECAUSE IT HOLDS PAINT A LITTLE BIT BETTER
GAbc4MyyZyo_13 0 BUT IF I'M GOING TO SET IT UP AND CLEAN IT THEN I WANT TO ACTUALLY TAKE THIS AND WITH WARM SOAPY WATER PREFERABLY WITH THE O-RING OFF WASH THIS AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE PORTS ALONG THE BARREL SURFACE ARE CLEAN AND CLEAR OF PAINT DEBRIS
grN00AVbsEQ_1 0 HI THIS IS DAN NOW WE ARE GOING TO DEMONSTRATE HOW TO SMOOTH YOUR WALLS ONCE YOU PUT YOUR FIRST COAT OF PAINT ON IT
grN00AVbsEQ_9 0 NOW IF YOU MOVE THIS YOU ARE GOING TO NOTICE THAT YOU START GETTING LINES IN YOUR PAINT
hhAazpDGZ-c_7 0 SO YOU JUST KINDA HAVE TO THINK IN TERMS OF THE LAYERS GOING BACKWARDS VERSUS WHEN YOU PAINT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
hhAazpDGZ-c_1 0 DAVID A CLEMEN HI I'M DAVID CLEMEN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO PAINT A PIECE OF GLASS INSIDE OF A FRAME
hhAazpDGZ-c_9 0 SO I'M GOING TO START WITH AND WHEN YOU PAINT WITH ACRYLIC ON GLASS YOU DON'T WANT TO USE ANY WATER ON THE PAINT BECAUSE IT TENDS TO STREAK IF YOU PUT WATER ON IT AND THAT'S NOT GONNA IT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO HELP YOUR PAINTING AT ALL
hhAazpDGZ-c_8 0 YOU JUST KINDA PAINT AS YOU GO
GEWfNycYYoU_7 0 ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME NEW SIDING INSTALLED AND YOU NEED A CONTRACTOR OUT THERE ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO CAULK AND PAINT IT AS WELL
gPTIs7lGMvM_8 0 IT'S A LAYOUT PAINT
G9tCHFntK_g_29 0 YOU GRAB YOUR PAINT GET YOUR CAN READY AND KEEP THE HANDLE OF THE CAN OVER HERE SO THAT WHEN IT FLIPS IT DOESN'T GET ONTO THE HANDLE
G9tCHFntK_g_13 0 THAT WAY IF ANY PAINT FLIES OVER IT'S NOT GOING LAND ON THAT HANDLE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT OUR HANDS ON
G9tCHFntK_g_15 0 YOU CAN ALSO GET STICKS AT THE PAINT STORE
H4onp2hk--k_5 0 THERE IS THE OIL BASED PASTEL WHICH IS A LOT OF FUN AND IT BLENDS EITHER WITH Q-TIPS OR ACTUALLY I'VE TRIED IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PAINT REMOVER LACQUER THINNER AND ITS AN INTERESTING PROCESS BUT I THINK JUST TO KEEP THE SMELLS DOWN AND JUST TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN JUST TRY BLENDING IT FIRST WITH THE PROFESSIONAL Q-TIP OR THE NUBS THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER AND I'LL EXPLAIN THOSE TO YOU IN JUST A MINUTE
gCqmjWeqtY4_11 0 JUST MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FILL UP THE HOLES WITH THE PAINT
gk0hmh49gCQ_9 0 I CALL IT SPILLING THE PAINT BOX BY DESIGN
gWDGiVZGd1M_11 0 SO GO AHEAD AND GET YOURSELF A FULL LOAD OF PAINT
gWDGiVZGd1M_14 0 AND THEN WORK THAT PAINT UP IN THERE
gWDGiVZGd1M_17 0 NOW WHEN YOU GO SIDEWAYS LIKE THIS YOU'LL GET MORE PAINT ON YOUR BRUSH
h749Xa_kMH4_16 0 IT'S ALMOST GLASSY AND THE PAINT SITS ON IT DIFFERENTLY
GcQeUIvMr_o_3 0 IT STAYS OUT IT'S A HARD CRUST WHICH MAKE IT EASIER TO PAINT SO THIS IS THE STRAWBERRY THAT I MADE YOU CAN SEE THAT IT IS ALREADY SHAPE ALL I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THE SHAPE SPOT WE ARE GOING TO COLOR IT
GcQeUIvMr_o_8 0 NOW I'M GOING TO USE THE GREEN FOOD COLORING JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU EITHER USE A DIFFERENT PAINT BRUSH OR WASH YOUR PAINT BRUSH VERY GOOD USE A DIFFERENT BOWL OR AGAIN WASH YOU BOWL REALLY GOOD OTHERWISE YOU ARE GOING TO GET A TOTALLY DIFFERENT COLOR FROM WHAT YOU WANTED
GIkXnMUo4wQ_3 0 AND SOME OF THE THINGS YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT FIRST IS WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO PAINT THE INSIDE OF YOUR DESIGN FIRST OR WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE OUTSIDE OF THE GOURD OR HOW MUCH IS GONNA BE THE NATURAL GOURD IS SHOWING
GIkXnMUo4wQ_8 0 YOU CAN ALSO USE WHAT THEY HAVE OUT ON THE MARKET NOW THEY'RE CALLED PAINT PENS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_9 0 PAINT PENTS WORK REALLY WELL
g_LPgfiX7Ik_12 0 ANOTHER WAY AND IN MY MIND THIS WOULD BE JUST ABOUT EVERY ARTIST'S DREAM IS TO MOVE TO SOME PLACE LIKE NEW YORK PARIS ITALY SOME YEAH EXOTIC FOREIGN LOCATION ANYWHERE LIKE THAT OPEN UP YOUR LITTLE ART GALLERY YOUR VERY OWN LITTLE ART GALLERY AND JUST PAINT
graxBSwGVhk_9 0 MAKE SURE YOU SHAKE YOUR PAINT ENAMEL PAINT SEPARATES A LOT A LITTLE BIT OUT AND IT'S OKAY WITH THIS TO ACTUALLY HAVE PAINT ON BOTH SIDES OF YOUR BRUSH
GcAximxvi1Y_17 0 YOU WANT TO PAINT IT ON SO THAT YOUR SKIN IS COMPLETELY SMOOTH AND CLEAR LIKE A WHITE PIECE OF PAPER BEFORE A PAINTER STARTS PAINTING
HCaiIjW5KBk_10 0 AN AIRLESS SPRAYER PUMPS THE PAINT THROUGH YOUR ORIFICE AND MAKES IT OUT INTO YOUR PINE SPRAY FINISH AND YOU HAVE YOUR ADJUSTMENT ON HERE TO ADJUST YOUR PRESSURE
G9tCHFntK_g_44 0 THIS IS HOW YOU POUR UP PAINT TO GET READY TO PAINT THE EXTERIOR EAVES
H5AZWktsnYs_4 0 AS YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THE TABLE I'M GOING TO USE MY LASHING TO BIND TOGETHER HERE A COUPLE OF MY ARTIST TOOLS HERE A COUPLE OF PAINT BRUSHES A PENCIL AND A MARKER
g6Nk9SdgLWc_6 0 NOW IF THE TEAM THAT'S NOT REALLY SHOOTING A LOT OF JUMP SHOTS AND THEY'RE NOT REALLY HITTING A LOT OF JUMP SHOTS AND THEY'RE REALLY PENETRATING THE PAINT YOU MIGHT WANT TO PACK IT IN A LITTLE BIT
GRBkx6X7G4Q_11 0 THE OLDER ONES LIKE THIS THEY'RE PAINTED ON AND IT'LL SMEAR THE PAINT AND YOUR ORNAMENT WILL BE RUINED
GnA7s3KLZSg_12 0 AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S LOTS OF CRUNCHY OLD PAINT AND NASTY STUFF
gcaXuKF6Bgk_3 0 AND YOU KNOW THAT THE FURTHER YOU PULL BACK THE AIRBRUSH THE MORE PAINT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET OUT AND ONE THING THAT YOU WANT TO DO UNLESS YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THAT THEN YOU WANT TO MOVE AS FAST AS YOU CAN
gcaXuKF6Bgk_1 0 OKAY WE'VE GOT YOUR PAINT AND YOU'VE PLAYED AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE BIT AND YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THE AIRBRUSH LET'S GO OVER A COUPLE OF LITTLE THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO WORK WITH
gcaXuKF6Bgk_8 0 JUST KEEP PLAYING WITH IT HAVE FUN AND DON'T LET IT IF YOU START HAVING PROBLEMS WITH IT IT CLOGS UP TAKE A MOMENT PULL THE NEEDLE OUT CLEAN IT DUMP YOUR PAINT OUT AND JUST GIVE IT JUST A LIGHT CLEANING
gdtbeY84CPM_7 0 SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE YOUR PAINT BRUSH STAYS IN A NICE POINT
gdtbeY84CPM_6 0 I GO A HEAD GET MY PAINT BRUSH WET GET MY BLACK I DO LIKE THE BLACK TO DO A PALM TREE JUST BECAUSE IT REALLY HAS A NICE CONTRAST WITH THE OTHER COLORS THAT I'M DOING
hhAazpDGZ-c_15 0 AND I ACTUALLY NEED MORE PAINT
hhAazpDGZ-c_12 0 AND YOU HAVE TO GET YOU HAVE TO TOUCH YOUR PAINT UP PRETTY OFTEN BECAUSE IF IT GETS THIN ON HERE IT'LL STREAK AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THROUGH
Ggm7feLhD5Q_3 0 SO FAR WE'VE PUT PAINT ON OUR RAZORBLADE AND GLUE SO IT WOULD BE DRYING
HcXjjA9Fcxw_8 0 SO MAKE SURE REMEMBER ONCE AGAIN WHEN USING THESE PAINTS AND WE'RE USING ACRYLIC PAINT YOU WANT TO GIVE YOURSELF ABOUT AN HOUR PER COAT
HcXjjA9Fcxw_4 0 IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO'S GOT A FAVORITE COLOR YOU CAN COME BACK TO YOUR SAME PAINT YOU HAD BEFORE YOUR ACRYLIC PAINT YOU CAN PAINT THE TIPS OF THESE WHICH GIVES IT A REALLY COOL EFFECT
HcXjjA9Fcxw_7 0 AND YOU CAN EVEN DO THIS BEFORE IF YOU WANT TO PAINT DESIGNS ON YOUR SHELLS IT'S ANOTHER GREAT IDEA TO DO
HcXjjA9Fcxw_6 0 YOU CAN PAINT THE WHOLE SHELL YOU CAN JUST DO THE TIPS LIKE I'M DOING HERE
HcXjjA9Fcxw_3 0 IF YOU'RE REALLY IN TO MONOCHROMATIC COLORS WE'VE GOT PINK AND BLUE HERE YOU CAN EVEN PAINT YOUR SHELLS
GnA7s3KLZSg_7 0 IT'S PRETTY RUSTY AND ANY PAINT HAS VANISHED LONG AGO
G5F-bwIsbFI_8 0 I PREFER TO USE PRE-PRIMED JUST BECAUSE IT SAVES YOU A STEP WHEN YOU'RE READY TO PAINT
g-EpkBK3-q8_5 0 YOU CAN SEE OCCASIONALLY I PUT A COAT OF PAINT ON IT JUST TO KEEP IT FRESH
gPnoD1ZRhnE_1 0 SO THEN THE NEXT OPTION IS FOR PAPERS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IN A SPECIFIC COLOR THAT YOU ARE FLIPPING THROUGH MAGAZINES CAN'T FIND OR LOOKING IN A PAPER STORE AND CAN'T FIND IS TO PAINT THE PAPER YOURSELF
Gw8PFSzolmg_8 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK OBVIOUSLY BUT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY PUT A LAYER OF PAINT ALONG THE OUTER EDGES WHICH ARE WHICH WERE COVERED WITH MASKING TAPE
Gw8PFSzolmg_4 0 NOW WHEN I USE THE PAINT I'M GOING TO BE USING A SOLID COLOR BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE DECORATING IT WITH A LOT OF BEADS AND I DON'T WANT IT TO BE TOO LOOK TOO KIND OF BUSY SO TO SPEAK
Gw8PFSzolmg_2 0 NOW I'M NOT SO WORRIED ABOUT THE TEXTURE UNDERNEATH OF THE MASKING TAPE AND THE WHITE BASE PAINT WHICH ALSO WENT ON KIND OF THICK BECAUSE THE TEXTURE IS KIND OF A I KIND OF LIKE HAVING A THE LITTLE BIT OF TEXTURE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PICTURE FRAME
Gw8PFSzolmg_1 0 NOW THAT THE COAT OF BASE PAINT THAT I'VE PUT ON HAS DRIED I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND COLOR THE PICTURE FRAME WITH MY YELLOW ACRYLIC PAINT
G_u8rvAVSCk_19 0 THIS WORKS GREAT LIKE I SAID PLUS IF YOU PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD USE WD FORTY IT'S A PETROLEUM BASE IT WILL USUALLY CLEAN UP AND I'VE ALSO BEEN TOLD IT WILL CLEAN UP IF YOUR CAR GETS HIT WITH SPRAY PAINT
G9tCHFntK_g_39 0 THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE SURE THAT YOUR PAINT STAYS GOOD AND FRESH
G9tCHFntK_g_34 0 JUST TAKE OFF THAT LITTLE BIT OF PAINT AND WORK YOURSELF AROUND THAT RIM
G9tCHFntK_g_37 0 SPEND A LITTLE EXTRA TIME AND BE SURE TO GET ALL THIS PAINT OUT OF THAT RIM BEFORE YOU SEAL BACK UP THIS CAN
G9tCHFntK_g_31 0 WHEN YOU DO THAT THAT'S GOING TO STOP THAT FLOW OF PAINT AND THEN EVEN IT OFF
GAbc4MyyZyo_11 0 THE OTHER THING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO ESPECIALLY SUCH AS WITH THIS BARREL WHERE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN PAINT A BALL HAS BROKEN IN IT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU BRING ALL THAT DEBRIS OUT
GDp_ahHKbns_3 0 SO YOU HAVE SOMEONE INSIDE THE CAR PUSHING DOWN ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AND ONCE THEY HAVE THE BRAKE PEDAL DOWN ALL THE WAY THEY WILL SAY DOWN AND YOU WILL LOOSEN THIS LITER VALVE RIGHT HERE IN THE LOOSEN DIRECTION AND LIQUID WILL COME OUT AND IT IS GOOD TO HAVE A CATCH CAN FOR THAT TOO BECAUSE IT GETS IN ALL THIS PAINT AND IT WILL EAT THAT OR WHEN YOU ARE DONE JUST WIPE IT ALL OFF AND ONCE YOU HAVE HAD IT SO THAT NO MORE LIQUID IS COMING OUT YOU TIGHTEN IT BACK UP AND YOU TELL THEM TO LET IT BACK UP AND THEY PUSH IT DOWN AGAIN AND YOU REPEAT THAT AND YOU OPEN THIS AGAIN AND BLEED IT OUT AND PERIODICALLY MAKE SURE YOU ARE CHECKING THE MASTER CYLINDER WHICH IS WHAT WE HAD OPENED AT FIRST AND WE USED THE TURKEY BASTER FOR FOR TAKING OUT THE FLUID AND YOU KEEP DOING THIS STEP OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON THIS PARTICULAR WHEEL UNTIL YOU GET NEW CLEAR FLUID COMING OUT AND THIS ONE IS DONE AND YOU WILL REMOVE THE NEXT ONE IN THE BACK AND THEN DO THE FRONT ONES
GkoeDMrq0Kw_3 0 DON'T SWIRL IT AROUND AND WIPE OFF THE PAINT ONTO YOUR PAPER TOWEL
HcXjjA9Fcxw_11 0 I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO APPLY SOME MORE PAINT TO THESE LITTLE SHELLS HERE
HcXjjA9Fcxw_12 0 AND THIS ACRYLIC PAINT IS GREAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH ANY POROUS SURFACE LIKE SHELLS OR WOOD IT'S GOING TO SOAK THAT PAINT RIGHT UP SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY PROBLEMS
GFasV9Lpgv0_16 0 SO GENERALLY ON THE FIRST FIRE YOU CONCENTRATE ON GETTING THE SHAPE OF YOUR PAINTING IN AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO HAVE ALL THE HIGHLIGHTS WHERE YOU WANT THEM AND THE LIGHTNESS THAT YOU WANT THEM BECAUSE YOU CANNOT GO BACK AND ADD PAINT ON TOP TO LIGHTEN THEM LIKE YOU DO WITH OIL PAINT OR ACRYLIC PAINT
gWDGiVZGd1M_35 0 AND IF YOU CAN GET A STUBBORN HOLE TO FILL UP JUST PUMP THAT BRUSH A LITTLE BIT IN AND OUT AND THAT'LL MOVE THAT PAINT UP INTO INTO THE BRUSH
GlCP-x3YvYI_8 0 WE'RE GOING TO USE A PAINT STIR STICK TO STIR THIS AS IT STARTS MELTING
G9tCHFntK_g_28 0 NOW YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND POUR YOUR PAINT
G9tCHFntK_g_23 0 YOU DON'T WANT EXCESS PAINT LAYING AROUND THE JOB SITE
H6DHOeeDBdY_10 0 NOW WE CAN KNOCK OUT THE GREEN BACKGROUND IN PHOTOSHOP OR ANOTHER PROGRAM BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH THIS WHITE SPACE IS WE'D HAVE TO PAINT AROUND THE IMAGE SO THAT WE'D HAVE THIS BLEND INTO A SKIN TONE
gZv9Ee1HkJc_13 0 YOU WANT TO AHEAD AND PULL THAT PAINT ON OUT BEING CAREFUL NOT TO LAP
gZv9Ee1HkJc_17 0 WE'RE GOING TO CARRY THIS FASCIA ON DOWN BUT THAT'S HOW YOU PAINT THE EXTERIOR FASCIA ON THE EXTERIOR EAVES OF YOUR HOUSE
h8alXw0uBc8_6 0 DEPENDING ON WHICH AGE OF KIDS AND HOW YOU WANT TO WORK THE PROJECT YOU CAN USE A PAINT BRUSH OR YOU CAN HAVE THEM SMEAR THE GLUE WITH THEIR FINGER
HHwBA2f1lGs_3 0 SINCE WE USED A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAINT
HHwBA2f1lGs_2 0 LET THE PAINT DRY AND THE GLUE DRY
HHwBA2f1lGs_7 0 IF YOU NEED TO DO A COUPLE OF COATS OF PAINT ON YOUR LIZARD YOU CAN DO THAT LET IT DRY COME BACK AND THEN PAINT IT OVER AGAIN
HHwBA2f1lGs_6 0 IF YOU PUT HIM ON A NEWSPAPER TO DRY WITH THIS KIND OF PAINT WITH THE ACRYLIC PAINT WHEN YOU LIFT HIM UP HE IS GOING TO HAVE PIECES OF THAT NEWSPAPER STUCK IT HIM AND IT IS ONLY GOING TO CREATE MORE OF A PROCESS FOR GOING BACK AND CLEANING UP AND REPAINTING AND PAINTING OVER
g6Nk9SdgLWc_14 0 BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE PREMISE AND EACH OF THOSE WILL HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GETTING ANYTHING THAT COMES IN THAT PAINT
g6Nk9SdgLWc_17 0 NOW IF IT GETS PAST THIS SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE THEN BACK HERE YOU'LL HAVE THE CENTER WHICH IS AGAIN THE CENTER WILL BE THE ONE THAT HOLDS THE PAINT DOWN AND IS IN THE MIDDLE ANYTHING THAT GETS PAST THAT LINE OF DEFENSE IS HIS OR HER RESPONSIBILITY
Gv2hBDeht4I_8 0 AND I'M GOING TO NEED PAINT I'M GOING TO NEED BRUSHES
Gv2hBDeht4I_2 0 WE'RE GOING TO PAINT ON THE FABRIC FOR OUR DIY PANTS
Gv2hBDeht4I_4 0 IT'S GOT A NICE NICE SURFACE HERE THAT'S SMOOTH WE DON'T HAVE CREASES THAT WE CAN PAINT ON
G6YN6Ujwkig_7 0 NOW REMEMBER WITH THIS THIS IS THE HARDEST PART SO GET THE EDGES PAINT ALL THIS THEN THE REST IS ALL OKAY
