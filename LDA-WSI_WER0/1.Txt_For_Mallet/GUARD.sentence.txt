gwXiVX3GwN4_8 0 AND THE MOSQUITO GUARD SURVIVES WITHOUT TAKING THE FOUR DAMAGE THAT THE CRESTED CRAGHORN WOULD DEAL
gwXiVX3GwN4_5 0 IN THIS CASE THE MOSQUITO GUARD EVEN THOUGH IT IS ONLY A ONE ONE CAN DEFEAT THE CRESTED CRAGHORN BECAUSE ITS TOUGHNESS IS ONLY ONE
gwXiVX3GwN4_7 0 THE MOSQUITO GUARD WILL KILL THE CRESTED CRAGHORN BY DEALING ONE POINT OF FIRST STRIKE DAMAGE
gS3MnTPVqjU_11 0 AGAIN I'M IN MY GUARD
Ga5NKgjslZo_8 0 AS YOU SEE THERE'S A GUARD THAT IS CURLED WHICH CAN PROTECT YOUR HAND AND HELP YOU PARRING HELP YOU BLOCK YOUR OPPONENT'S ATTACKS
hDyjZMvW3H8_14 0 THAT WILL MAKE YOU A REALLY STRONG GUARD
_G7tWX0egAU_3 0 THIS IS A UH LIFE JACKET SOMETHING THAT YOU WEAR AS A VEST YOU WANT TO GET ONE THAT'S COMFORTABLE THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOU IF YOU IF YOU FALL OUR OF YOUR BOAT OR YOU GO SWIMMING AND VIRTUALLY ALL OF THESE ARE COAST GUARD APPROVED SO THAT THE U.S COAST GUARD APPROVES THE VEST BASED ON THEIR DESIGN BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF FLOTATION THAT THEY HAVE IN THEM AND YOU'LL SEE THAT IN THE INSIDE OF THE BACK OF EVERY VEST THERE'S A COAST GUARD APPROVED INSIGNIA AND THAT WILL TELL YOU WHAT TYPE IT IS
GDeyxGoOWnQ_8 0 LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW THE GUARD PULLS OUT VIDEO DEMO
GDeyxGoOWnQ_9 0 WHEN THIS GUARD PULLS WE WANT HIM TO TAKE ONE STEP BACK
GDeyxGoOWnQ_6 0 WE WANT TO FILL THE SPOT OF THE GUARD
GDeyxGoOWnQ_4 0 ONE WHEN THIS GUARD PULLS OUT THAT WILL LEAVE A BIG HOLE ON THIS SIDE
GDeyxGoOWnQ_5 0 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU PULL THE GUARD YOU HAVE A RUNNING BACK COMING THROUGH OR THAT THE TACKLE KNOWS THAT HE HAS TO COVER OR WE HAVE A TIGHT END CRACKING DOWN ETC
GDeyxGoOWnQ_2 0 WHAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS WHEN YOU USE THE GUARD EFFECTIVELY AS A PULLING GUARD
GDeyxGoOWnQ_3 0 WE MUST MAKE SURE OF A FEW THINGS WHEN WE PULL OUR GUARD
Gz_i5gyj6Ck_2 0 AND THAT INVOLVES A GUARD GENERALLY DRIBBLING AROUND THE TOP OF THE KEY AREA
gGSns9nz4-I_6 0 WHAT THEY DO IS THEY GUARD PRISONERS THAT HAVE BEEN HOUSED ARRESTED OR JAILED BECAUSE OF FEDERAL OFFENSES
GSdywZYtP3g_16 0 ANOTHER GOOD THING THAT WORKS REALLY WELL IS STATIC GUARD WHICH WE ALL KNOW FROM USING ON OUR SKIRTS WITH HOSE
GSdywZYtP3g_18 0 SO JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU USE A CONDITIONER IN THE SHOWER AFTER YOU SHAMPOO SOMETHING LIGHT THAT DE-TANGLES AND IF IT'S REALLY BAD A LEAVE IN CONDITIONER BEFORE YOU STYLE AND THEN AGAIN YOU CAN TRY A STATIC GUARD HAIRSPRAY WATER
HhgieT3w08k_9 0 BUT YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE SURE YOU GET A ONE SHOT ONE KILL ON THIS FIRST WE KINDA HAVE WAY POINTS OR WHATEVER WITH CAPTAIN MCMILLAN HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH A FEW FEW LITTLE THINGS WITH TAKING DOWN SOME GUARD SOME GUARD POST AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT YOU'VE GOT YOU HAVE TO GET THE ONE SHOT ONE KILL TO BEGIN WITH HERE
gwXiVX3GwN4_2 0 HERE ON A CARD CALLED MOSQUITO GUARD YOU WILL SEE THAT IS SAYS FIRST STRIKE
gj_clsvISbo_7 0 AND THE SAME GOES FOR THE FOREHAND SIDE SO INSTEAD OF THIS ARM GUARD IT'S LIKE THAT
HA1_r-jDfVk_9 0 THIS IS KEY TURN THE GUARD TO MAKE THE PARRY
HA1_r-jDfVk_8 0 ALL PARRIES START IN THE FINGERS TURNING THE GUARD TO MAKE THE PARRY
GQXKm3M9-Cs_3 0 THIS GUY RIGHT NOW HAS THE BALL SO HE HAS TO COMMIT TO HIM AND HE HAS TO GUARD HIM FULLY BUT AS QUICKLY AS THE BALL MOVES FROM THERE GO AHEAD AND MOVE IT TO THE TOP OF THE KEY
g6Nk9SdgLWc_5 0 NOW DEPENDING ON HOW DEPENDING ON THE OFFENSE THAT THEY'RE PLAYING AND HOW EFFECTIVE THAT OFFENSE IS THAT WILL DETERMINE HOW FAR YOUR POINT GUARD WILL GO OUT
gGhOMWlbzGs_9 0 SO I SLIDE UP I KEEP MY HANDS ON MY GUARD
h8lMozsztuQ_5 0 NOW THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO GUARD AGAINST THIS
HA1_r-jDfVk_6 0 COME BACK ON GUARD
g6Nk9SdgLWc_4 0 WHEN YOU'RE SETTING UP A ONE THREE ONE FIRST OF ALL YOU WANT TO SET IT UP WHERE YOUR POINT GUARD IS AT THE TOP OF THE KEY AROUND THIS AREA
g6Nk9SdgLWc_7 0 YOUR POINT GUARD MIGHT WANT TO COME DOWN AND BE INSIDE HERE
gHik_54lD7s_18 0 THE HANDS ARE IN WHAT'S CALLED A SPLIT GUARD POSITION
GtOH4JSl2Ic_4 0 WITH THIS SETUP YOU WANT TO BE SURE TO HAVE A GUARD CLAMP BEHIND A STOP-CLAMP BEHIND THIS BOARD SO THAT WHEN THE BELT SANDER'S ON HERE IT DOESN'T JUST FLY OFF BECAUSE A BELT SANDER'S A VERY POWERFUL TOOL AND WILL THROW THIS PIECE AROUND BUT WE'VE GOT THIS STOP HERE AND THAT'S GOING TO KEEP THIS IN PLACE AS WELL AS LET THE BELT SANDER GO COMPLETELY AND COVER THE WHOLE AREA OF THE PIECE OF WOOD HERE
hdUwm9SRFb4_6 0 NOW YOU WANT TO SPEND SOME TIME ROLLING BACKWARDS AND GETTING COMFORTABLE IN THIS POSITION BECAUSE SINCE YOU DON'T ROLL BACKWARDS VERY OFTEN IT CAN SOMETIMES CATCH YOU OFF GUARD IF YOU HIT SOMETHING TO ROLL AND FALL DIRECTLY IN THE DIRECTION YOU'RE HEADED SO YOU'RE ROLLING BACKWARDS AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR FEET IN THE OLLIE POSITION
GnA7s3KLZSg_5 0 THERE'S A PLASTIC GUARD THAT KEEPS SOME OF THE BATTERY ACID OFF OF THE METAL TRAY
HforiGOhPEI_6 0 THAT CHAIN GUARD IS GORGEOUS
GDeyxGoOWnQ_11 0 WHEN HE PULLS WE DON'T WANT THIS GUARD TO BE IN THE BACKFIELD BECAUSE WE MAY BE BRINGING A RUN RIGHT AHEAD OF HIM
GDeyxGoOWnQ_15 0 WHEN A GUARD PULLS OUT HE HAS TO GO AT A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE
hCvNibEfOOM_7 0 SO WE CAN USE HIM OUT ON THE WING AS AN OUTSIDE SHOOTER WHAT WE CALL THE SMALL FORWARD POSITION WHICH IS ACTUALLY LIKE ANOTHER BIG GUARD
hCvNibEfOOM_5 0 BUT OUR FORWARDS ARE GOING TO BE THE BIG GUYS YOU WANT TO CONCENTRATE ON THE SMALL FORWARD BEING A BIG GUARD THAT CAN SHOOT
hCvNibEfOOM_8 0 SOME OFFENSES RUN A THREE GUARD SET SO INSTEAD OF HAVING A SMALL FORWARD THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER GUARD
HFA_4HkuXqc_4 0 IT'S ALSO AN OPTION TO HAVE A STALL GUARD SO THAT YOUR HORSE IS ABLE TO STICK IT'S HEAD OUT AND THE VENTILATION IS IMPROVED
g6Nk9SdgLWc_16 0 ON THE OTHER SIDE SAME THING WITH THE SHOOTING GUARD ANYTHING OVER THERE PAST THE POINT GUARD WILL BE THAT SHOOTING GUARDS RESPONSIBILITY
g6Nk9SdgLWc_11 0 SO YOU'LL HAVE THE POINT GUARD UP TOP YOU'LL HAVE A FORWARD RIGHT HERE A CENTER WILL BE A LITTLE FURTHER BACK BUT WHAT YOU'LL HAVE IS YOU'LL HAVE A SMALL FORWARD HERE YOU'LL HAVE THE SHOOTING GUARD ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SUPPORT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEFENSE
g6Nk9SdgLWc_13 0 NOW YOU MAY OR MAY NOT WANT THE OUTSIDE PLAYERS THE FORWARD AND THE SHOOTING GUARD TO MOVE UP A LITTLE BIT THAT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU WANT TO RUN IT
g6Nk9SdgLWc_12 0 SO YOU'LL HAVE A SMALL FORWARD POWER FORWARD ALONG THE MIDDLE AND YOU'LL HAVE THE SHOOTING GUARD ON THE OTHER SIDE
Gqd8r4WCpM0_11 0 IF YOU SEE INSIDE THE GUARD THERE IS PLUG TO WHICH THE WIRE PLUGS IN VERY NICELY ALLOWING THE ELECTRICAL BOX TO SCORE AND TO REGISTER WHO GETS THE HIT
GDeyxGoOWnQ_18 0 IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE GUARD STAYS AT A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE RIGHT DOWN THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE
