gT35PHYO7rE_8 0 SO WHEN YOU HIT IT TOSS THE BALL IN FRONT OF YOU TAKE YOUR ARM BACK LEAD WITH YOUR ELBOW AND HIT WITH YOUR HAND OPEN AND OUT IN FRONT OF YOU
gT35PHYO7rE_6 0 SO WHEN SERVING WHAT YOU WANT TO IS YOU WANT TO HAVE A BASKET OF BALLS TAKE THE BALL OUT IN FRONT OF YOU TOSS IT UP IN FRONT OF YOU HIGH ENOUGH SO YOU HAVE TIME TO GET TO IT AND HIT IT WITH YOUR HAND
gm9xAQEhc44_15 0 BALL COMES OUT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEY DON'T GET THE FOUL CALLED BECAUSE THE PLAYER THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO BOX OUT IS EASILY ABLE TO GET THE REBOUND
gm9xAQEhc44_13 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH SPACE IN BETWEEN YOURSELF AND THE RIM SO WHEN THE BALL COMES OFF YOU CAN REBOUND IT EASILY
GUE6zOwZogY_2 0 MOST OF THEM ARE EQUIPPED WITH A BALL BEARING TYPE SWIVEL AT THE VERY END SO THAT MAKES THEM A LITTLE BIT FASTER AND THE JUMP ROPE ITSELF DOESN'T GET BALLED UP INSIDE THE HANDLE
gvKIJCe5zXY_5 0 YOU'RE KNEELING HANDS GET PLACED ON THE BALL KIND OF LIKE A KARATE CHOP AND WHEN I PUSH THE BALL OUT BENDING AT THE HIPS AND THEN USING THE ELBOWS TO DRIVE THE BALL IN TO THE SIDE AND BACK UP
G9iDjvQL_mQ_1 0 OK THE NEXT CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SCORING YOUR POINTS OR YOUR BALLS TO MOVE FORWARD TO SINK EVENTUALLY THE EIGHT BALL AND WIN THE GAME
G9iDjvQL_mQ_3 0 WE KNOW THAT IF YOU MAKE A LEGAL SHOT YOU GET TO SCORE AGAIN AND CONTINUE TO KEEP PLAYING SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A SCENARIO WHERE I'M STRIPES AND THERE'S TWO BALLS AND I'M STILL SHOOTING I COULD SO SOMETHING WHERE I CALL THE TWELVE BALL IN THE CORNER AND TRY TO STOP THE Q BALL HERE BECAUSE AGAIN AS YOU LEARN POOL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN POSITIONING AND AGAIN THIS IS A DIFFERENT VIDEO WE'RE JUST LEARNING ABOUT THE STRATEGY OF THE GAME AND TRYING TO WIN THE GAME BUT I WOULD TRY TO MAKE THE TWELVE THE TEN AND NOW ALL MY BALLS ARE DONE
G9iDjvQL_mQ_9 0 I'M TRYING TO GET THAT EIGHT BALL BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU WIN YOU HAVE TO MAKE LEGAL SHOTS
gG-6J8YPvig_10 0 OKAY SO THIS IS ABOUT HOW YOU SHOULD BE TURNED WHEN YOU HIT THE BALL
gG-6J8YPvig_11 0 SO THE HIP SHOULDER TURN IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GOING TO HIT THE BALL STRAIGHT TRUE AND FAR
gqcqN86jHhQ_9 0 SO YOU WANT TO HAVE YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR BALL SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU CAN GET IT KIND OF QUICK AND IT S NOT GOING TO BOTHER YOU DURING THE POINT
gqcqN86jHhQ_8 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO GO BACK PICK UP A BALL AND COME BACK TO YOUR SECOND SERVE
gqcqN86jHhQ_1 0 THE SERVER STARTS THE POINT AND YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TWO CHANCES TO PUT THE BALL INSIDE THE SMALL SQUARE ACROSS YOU INSIDE THE SERVICE LINE
gFAw9JA-pQc_9 0 AND NUMBER SEVEN IF YOU TURN IT OVER BEFORE THAT CLUB HEAD HITS THE BALL YOU'RE GOING TO HOOK
gFAw9JA-pQc_5 0 NUMBER THREE IF YOU GET YOUR HANDS IN FRONT OF THE BALL
gFAw9JA-pQc_6 0 NUMBER FOUR IF YOU PLAY THE BALL A LITTLE FURTHER BACK IN YOUR STANCE
GvvwzOplZcU_6 0 NOW WATCH THE BLUE BALL
GvvwzOplZcU_18 0 THEN WHEN YOU ADD THE THIRD BALL YOU HAVE COLUMNS
GvvwzOplZcU_11 0 HERE'S ONLY THE BLUE BALL IS DOING A REVERSE CASCADE
hiIHTYpRh8Y_10 0 SO IT'S LIKE THROWING A DART THEORETICALLY IF YOU CAN GET THAT BALL TO A NICE LOFT
gU2a1iWlJNA_6 0 BUT CONSIDERING YOUR OTHER OPTION IS REALLY A SILICONE JUGGLING BALL THAT RUN ANYWHERE FROM $30 TO $50 DOLLAR A PIECE
gU2a1iWlJNA_1 0 ALL RIGHT THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT BOUNCE JUGGLING IS WHAT KIND OF BALL TO USE
hHaUCcj7Cyo_14 0 ANOTHER THING WE CAN DO IS STANDING BEHIND THE BALL JUST WORKING ON OUR VERTICAL LEAP
hHaUCcj7Cyo_15 0 AS WELL YOU CAN JUMP OVER THE BALL AND BACK BEHIND THE BALL AND OVER THE BALL AND BEHIND THE BALL
hHaUCcj7Cyo_11 0 YOU STEP OVER AND JUMPING OVER THE BALL JUST AS IF YOU'RE JUMPING OVER A DEFENDER AS YOU'RE GOING DOWN THE FIELD
GYT8VoWz17U_8 0 O'KAY YOU ARE GOING TO PUSH BACK PRESSING AGAINST THE INFLATED BALL AND THEN RELAXING THE SHOULDERS AND BACK FORWARD
GYT8VoWz17U_6 0 YOU ARE GOING TO PUSH BACK IT IS A VERY SMALL MOVEMENT AND THEN COME FORWARD KEEPING YOUR BACK NICE AND STRAIGHT PUSH BACK GETTING THAT RESISTANCE OF THE BALL BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES AND THEN COME FORWARD
GYT8VoWz17U_3 0 YOU ARE GOING TO PLACE YOUR BALL JUST A LITTLE BIT BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES O'KAY
GYT8VoWz17U_1 0 O'KAY IN THIS CLIP WE ARE GOING TO BE USING AN INFLATABLE BALL TO HELP STRENGTHEN THE LOW BACK
H1EjVAs2GlM_7 0 WE WANT TO REMAIN ON THE BALL OF THE FOOT AND NOT FLAT HEEL
h9OYqrhfW98_18 0 AND WHAT THIS ALLOWS TO HAPPEN IS IN A LOT OF CASES WHEN IT'S A RUN BALL HE'S GOING TO BLOW THIS MAN OUT AND THE RUNNING BACK SHOULD HAVE THE SMARTS TO GO OFF OF HIS BUTT
g4m9I6gdaaE_7 0 TO START WITH YOUR FEET ARE AT A SHOULDER DISTANCE YOU'RE GOING TO TURN YOUR BODY TO THE RIGHT AS YOU'RE TURNING TO THE RIGHT YOUR RIGHT HEEL TURNS AND YOUR LEFT FOOT TURNS ON THE BALL OF THE FOOT
gg3XNPOBTqk_2 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS HAVE YOUR HANDS AND YOUR FINGERS SPREAD APART ON THE BALL YOU LEFT HAND GUIDING THE BALL SO IT'S LOOKS LIKE YOU WOULD BE GUIDING YOUR BALL TOWARDS THE BASKET
gg3XNPOBTqk_3 0 SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS WHEN YOU LIFT UP YOU BEND UP WITH YOUR LEGS AND YOU MOVE UP WITH THE BALL AND WITH THIS HAND YOU GUIDE IT SO IT DOESN'T GO IN ANY OTHER DIRECTION BESIDE THE ACTION YOU GOING TOWARDS AND YOU MOVE THE BALL UP AND YOU HOLD IT WITH YOUR FINGERS
GWCJn50YQoY_19 0 THIS ALLOWS YOU TO GO AT THE BALL WITH THE RACKET EDGE AND KIND OF BRUSH THE BALL WHEN YOU NEED TO
gwL9fYY3zHA_18 0 BALL GOES HERE THIS GUY DRIBBLES IT THIS GUY STAYS BEHIND YOU GET THE DEFENSE TO COMMIT HERE REVERSE THE BALL TO THIS GUY
gwL9fYY3zHA_15 0 WE'VE GOT THE BALL TAKING WE'VE GOT THE GUY TAKING THE BALL OUT OF BOUNDS
GD4d-f-mp9I_8 0 IT'LL SOAK DOWN INTO THE ROOT BALL DEEP AND SLOW
GyadXiKJfLU_10 0 SO YOU ALSO WANT TO SCORE YOUR CLAY BALL REALLY WELL
hg0PYALmd64_11 0 NOW REMEMBER YOU'RE GOING TO HIT A LITTLE EXTRA DISTANCE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU DRAW THE BALL
gyM46ZenVQ4_11 0 AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT A LOT OF BEGINNING PLAYERS DO THAT REALLY IS NOT PROPER IS PUTTING THE CUE BALL TOO FAR BACK WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TOO MUCH DISTANCE TO TRAVEL FROM THAT POINT UP TO THERE
gyM46ZenVQ4_17 0 WE DON'T WANT TO USE ANY ENGLISH TO SQUIRT THE CUE BALL OFF ONE SIDE OF THE OTHER
gyM46ZenVQ4_16 0 BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS BALL COMING UP OFF THE TABLE AND WE WANT IT TO GO STRAIGHT DOWN HERE
gyM46ZenVQ4_18 0 WE WANT TO CONTACT THAT BALL FULL AND WE WANT TO HIT IT AS FAST AS WE CAN
hbtksI9ewLk_15 0 BUT THIS IS REALLY GOOD PRACTICE RIGHT HERE BECAUSE NOW WE'RE GOING TO KICK AT THE BALL
hbtksI9ewLk_10 0 SO WE'RE BACK TO IDENTIFYING OUR ANGLE INTO THE CUSHION AND OUT ONCE AGAIN TO HIT THIS BALL
h5Tc0QPiB_o_14 0 YOU'RE GOING TO OPEN UP THE INSIDE ARM IS OPEN THE BALL'S GOING TO GO IN YOU'RE GOING TO COVER THE BALL WITH BOTH TIPS AND HOLD ON TO IT TIGHT STAYING LOW IN ORDER TO EXPLODE THROUGH THE HOLE
h5Tc0QPiB_o_10 0 ONCE THE BALL GOES INSIDE HE WANTS TO WRAP THE BALL UP TIGHT AND COVER IT WITH BOTH TIPS OVER THE BALL
gh6J2QPQPJE_12 0 BUT THE MAIN THIS IS YOU WANT TO READ YOUR DEFENDER AND FIGURE OUT WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO SHOOT THE BALL AFTER CATCHING IT AND GETTING IT READY
h_-0HYW5eOQ_14 0 HAVE THE BALL HERE AND HAVE THE QUICKEST RELEASE AS POSSIBLE MEANING DON'T TAKE THE BALL HERE AND THEN DROP IT DOWN HERE TO THROW IT
h_-0HYW5eOQ_15 0 HAVE THE BALL HERE BOOM QUICK RELEASE
h_-0HYW5eOQ_16 0 YOU GUYS CAN WATCH JOHN ELWAY HOLDS THE BALL HERE DOESN'T EVEN WIND UP THROWS IT FROM THERE
h_-0HYW5eOQ_10 0 TWO HANDS ON THE BALL AND YOU WANT TO KEEP THE BALL IDEALLY UP UP AROUND YOUR SHOULDERS
h_-0HYW5eOQ_11 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO CARRY THE BALL DOWN HERE BECAUSE WHAT THAT DOES IT CAUSES YOU TO HAVE A SLOW RELEASE
hJ_CfDvv_sw_11 0 THAT MEANS THAT THE PITCHER'S ACTUALLY THROWN THE BALL AND HIT THE BATTER
hJ_CfDvv_sw_16 0 THIS IS WHEN THE PITCHER THROWS THE BALL WILDLY OUT OF THE CATCHER'S RANGE
gH1sh_ECCcY_7 0 SO FIRST OF ALL WHEN THE SHOT GOES UP WE'RE GOING TO NOT LOOK AT THE BALL BUT WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUR MAN
G_leenn4ZPM_6 0 SO IF MY TEAM WERE TO SERVE THE BALL AND WE GET AN IN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE COURT WE GET IT IN THE SQUARE AND ON THE GROUND WE GET A POINT
G_leenn4ZPM_5 0 AND WHEN USING THIS TYPE OF SCORING THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A POINT IS WHEN YOU SERVE THE BALL
G_leenn4ZPM_8 0 THE ONLY WAY IN TRADITIONAL OR SIDE OUT SCORING YOU CAN GET A POINT IS IF YOU SERVE THE BALL
gIXVjBpc0u8_5 0 A TENNIS RACKET IS GOING TO GO ALONG WITH YOUR TENNIS BALL SO YOU CAN HIT THE BALL BACK AND FORTH
gIXVjBpc0u8_6 0 NOW THE REST OF THE THINGS YOU NEED ARE NOT QUITE AS ESSENTIAL AS YOUR TENNIS BALL AND YOUR TENNIS RACKET
gM5hgcDtE_I_4 0 NOW WHEN YOU ARE FIRST TAKING THE BALL OUT YOU WANT TO YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO CROSS THE HALF COURT LINE BEFORE EIGHT TO TEN SECONDS
gM5hgcDtE_I_5 0 IT USED TO BE TEN SECONDS IN MY DAY WHEN I PLAYED BUT I HAVE SEEN WHERE THEY HAVE COUNTED EIGHT SO YOU WANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND WHENEVER YOU ARE PLAYING BALL THAT YOU GOT TO CROSS THAT HALF COURT LINE AND YOU CAN NEVER CAN NEVER PASS IT BACK ACROSS THAT LINE ONCE YOU HAVE CROSSED OVER INTO THE OFFENSE THE FRONT COURT
h0Gfjk_apOY_4 0 BEFORE WE GET TO THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO STILL WITH ONE BALL AND WE'RE GOING TO CALL THIS THE ONE BALL ARK
h0Gfjk_apOY_5 0 SO GET RID OF THOSE TWO BALLS ONCE AGAIN WE STILL JUST NEED ONE BALL TO GET THIS GOING
G_q2GdcAglE_3 0 REALLY YOU CAN INCORPORATE IT INTO A BALL PATTERN BUT YOU CAN BALANCE ANYTHING YOU WANT
gJBKLgcmnbo_9 0 SO YOU WANT TO CREATE AS MUCH CLUB HEAD SPEED FOR THOSE HIGH HANDICAP PLAYERS WHO HAVE TROUBLE GETTING THE BALL UP IN THE AIR
GiuaUeZM1fo_9 0 THESE HAVE ROTATING CUPS ON BALL JOINTS
gshW4zhq1O8_17 0 THIS IS A SPEED BALL NIB
HfCi4kYOYW0_8 0 OKAY NOW THAT'S THE RISK YOU ALWAYS RUN IS TINNING A BALL IF YOU GO FOR A WINNER
GUPsktT50Zg_6 0 NOW WHEN YOU GO IN THE BALL YOU CAN STAY ON YOUR KNEES AND JUST BASICALLY BEND FORWARD ALWAYS THINKING OF A LINE SHINING THROUGH THE CROWN OF THE HEAD
GUPsktT50Zg_3 0 SO PLEASE IF YOU HAVEN'T TRIED THIS MOVE AND JUST HAPPEN TO FIND THIS CLIP ONLINE I WILL HIGHLY SUGGEST THAT YOU CHECK OUT THE OTHER CLIPS ON ARM EXTENSIONS FORWARD EXTENSIONS ON THE BALL TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU MASTER THE MOVES PROPERLY
gUMJ93lBku0_5 0 YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP YOUR HAND ON TOP OF IT YOU'RE GOING TO PULL THE BALL BACK
gUMJ93lBku0_4 0 SO AS YOU'RE GOING TO SEE FROM THESE GUYS THEY'RE GOING TO BE DRIBBLING HARD INTO THE DEFENDER AND ONCE THEY FEEL LIKE THAT THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE DRIBBLE ANYMORE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IS THEY'RE GOING TO DRIBBLE IN AND THEY'RE GOING TO PULL THE BALL BACK
gUMJ93lBku0_7 0 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP THAT SHIELD UP AS YOU'RE PULLING THE BALL BACK BECAUSE IF NOT YOU PULL THE BALL BACK AND YOU LEAVE YOURSELF OPEN AND EXPOSED THE DEFENDER ALL HE HAS TO DO IS STEP THROUGH TAKE THAT BALL AND HE'S GOING TO GO DOWN ON THE OTHER END AND SCORE IT
gUMJ93lBku0_6 0 WHEN YOU DO YOU DRIBBLE YOU KEEP THE BALL IN CLOSE TO YOU AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEAL YOUR DEFENDER AWAY AND KEEP YOUR SHIELD UP
gUMJ93lBku0_3 0 AND THE WAY THAT YOU USE THIS DRIBBLE IS IF YOU'RE DRIBBLING DOWN THE FLOOR AND YOUR DEFENDER IS CLOSING TIGHT ON YOU AND YOU DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE TO CONTINUE FORWARD WHAT YOU CAN DO IS YOU CAN PULL THE BALL BACK AND GET AWAY FROM YOUR DEFENDER
h8ZC9z944cU_5 0 IF YOU WANTED TO CUT THE BALL TO THE LEFT IN A CUTTER FASTBALL YOU'D POSITION YOUR FINGERS ON THE LEFT HALF OF THE BALL TO CREATE SPIN AND MOVEMENT THAT WOULD MAKE THE BALL BASICALLY CURVE TO THE RIGHT
h8ZC9z944cU_4 0 IF YOU WANT TO CUT THE BALL TO THE RIGHT AND YOU'RE A RIGHT HANDED PITCHER YOU WOULD CUT THE BALL IN HALF AND POSITION BOTH FINGERS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BALL
h8ZC9z944cU_3 0 THE CUTTER IS ACCOMPLISHED BY EITHER CUTTING THE BALL TO THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT
gNQ8T42zsuw_17 0 YOU WANT PRESSURE ON THE BALL OF THE FOOT
gT35PHYO7rE_16 0 HITTING DRILLS YOU HAVE A SETTER WHO WILL SET THE BALL TO THE HITTER
gT35PHYO7rE_12 0 WHEN PASSING THE BALL YOU WANT TO HIT IT BETWEEN YOUR WRISTS AND YOUR ELBOW
gT35PHYO7rE_10 0 SO THE TOSSER WOULD TOSS THE BALL TO THE PASSER THE PASSER WANTS TO GET BEHIND THE BALL FACE THEIR TARGET USE THEIR KNEES GET THEIR BUTT DOWN
gT35PHYO7rE_19 0 SO I'M RIGHT HANDED SO I'M GOING TO STEP FIRST WITH MY RIGHT FOOT SO I TAKE A TWO STEP APPROACH RIGHT LEFT BEND DOWN PUT MY HANDS BEHIND ME PALMS FACING UP AND THEN ONCE I'M DOWN BRING MY HANDS UP TO BRING ME UP HIGHER ABOVE THE GROUND AND THEN I'M GOING TO DROP MY ELBOW LEAD WITH MY LEFT ARM AND SWING THROUGH THE BALL
-Gvog-GliMU_21 0 SO THAT WAS THE MED BALL CHEST PASS AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO SOME GRIP EXERCISES
GSu1jmclxQ8_5 0 ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS EXERCISE IS YOU ARE ACTUALLY CAUSING YOUR INNER THIGHS TO CONTRACT AGAINST THE MEDICINE BALL WHICH IS GOING TO ADD AN EXTRA CHALLENGE AND YOU ARE GOING TO FEEL IT A LITTLE BIT DEEPER IN YOUR ABDOMINALS
GSu1jmclxQ8_1 0 OUR NEXT CLIP IS GOING TO BE STABILIZATION CRUNCHES WITH THE MEDICINE BALL
GSu1jmclxQ8_3 0 NOW IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HOLDING ON TO THIS BALL YOU CAN ALWAYS TRY TO CROSS YOUR ANKLES BUT I RECOMMEND TRYING TO JUST POSITION YOUR FEET TO HOLD THE MEDICINE BALL
GSu1jmclxQ8_2 0 OF COURSE YOU WANT TO GET DOWN NICE AND GENTLY ON THE MAT AND FOLD DOWN NICE AND SLOW AND YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE YOUR MEDICINE BALL AND YOU ARE GOING TO PLACE IT BETWEEN THE THIGHS AND YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP YOUR FEET AT NINETY DEGREES
h_aRZFWVAGw_7 0 GRAB YOUR MEDICINE BALL WITH BOTH HANDS
GL1aNimfMxs_5 0 THIS LITTLE ENERGY BALL IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT
h_-0HYW5eOQ_7 0 THE MAIN THING THAT YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON ARE TWO HANDS ON THE BALL
h0Gfjk_apOY_9 0 WHEN WE WERE THROWING OUR BALL UP WITH THE ONE HANDED TOSS WE WERE JUST GOING UP IN THE AIR
gImBKT9w0Mk_14 0 YOU CAN'T BE MOVING THAT BALL AROUND
gImBKT9w0Mk_12 0 ANYTIME THAT BALL COMES UP OR IS MOVED IF THE OFFICIALS CATCH IT THAT WILL BE CALLED AS AN OFFSIDE S
gImBKT9w0Mk_13 0 ONCE YOU GET THAT BALL LOCKED AND READY YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT THERE
gImBKT9w0Mk_10 0 HE DEFINITELY CANNOT LIFT THE BALL UP AT ANY POINT ANY TIME
gwL9fYY3zHA_21 0 THIS GUY'S DRIBBLING GETS THE BALL TO THE MIDDLE HE NOW SEES THIS GUY COMING PASSES HERE
h_aRZFWVAGw_10 0 AND YOU'RE GOING TO DROP THE BALL SLIGHTLY BEHIND THE HEAD TO ABOUT NINETY DEGREES AND EXTEND UP
gm9xAQEhc44_19 0 BALL COMES OFF THE RIM IT'S POSITION FIRST CONTACT FIRST YOU'RE MAKING SURE YOU FEEL THE OTHER GUY FIRST AND THEN YOU GO FOR THE BALL
GIdUQK1Br54_5 0 THERE ARE SOME GORGEOUS BALL GOWNS OUT THERE THAT ARE DESIGNED WITH ROUCHING HERE THAT HIDES A MULTITUDE OF SINS
GdlXzDmgnSM_9 0 SO YOU WANT TO ATTACK THE BALL WHICH IS WHAT YOU WOULD DO DURING A PASSING PATTERN YOU WANT TO ATTACK THE BALL AND GET IT INTO YOUR POSSESSION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
GdlXzDmgnSM_8 0 NOW AS YOU GET A LITTLE BIT MORE SOPHISTICATED WITH IT YOU AGGRESSIVELY CATCH THE BALL OUT OF THE AIR
GdlXzDmgnSM_3 0 THROW THE BALL UP
GdlXzDmgnSM_2 0 NOW WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANYBODY AROUND AND CHRIS IS OVER HERE AND BRIAN'S JUST DOING HIS WORKOUT WHAT BRIAN CAN DO AND I JUST CALL IT THE LONELY BOY WORKOUT IS JUST THROW THE BALL UP TO YOURSELF AND WORK ON CATCHING JUST WORK ON YOUR CATCHING TECHNIQUE
GdlXzDmgnSM_6 0 AND THIS WILL BE THE TRUEST THING THAT HE CAN DO FOR HIMSELF IS TO KEEP HIS ARMS PUMPING JUST LIKE HE WOULD DURING RUNNING A ROUTE AND GET THE BALL RIGHT INTO HIS WINDOW
GdlXzDmgnSM_5 0 NOW AS BRIAN GETS MORE COMFORTABLE HE CAN THROW THE BALL UP EMULATE A RUNNING AND THEN BREAK DOWN AND CATCH THE BALL
G86v1M4mmXc_2 0 TAKE THE STRAP AROUND THE BALL OF THE FOOT AND LAY RIGHT DOWN
gZPrTmZtZmI_11 0 AND TO GET THAT BALL SOUND AGAIN YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR PLIE TO DIG INTO THE GROUND
-Gvog-GliMU_8 0 O.K SO I'M GOING TO START WITH THE BALL HERE AND I'M GOING TO PUSH STRAIGHT OUT
H1EjVAs2GlM_11 0 OR YOU CAN DO A MEDICINE BALL AND NO WEIGHT AT ALL
heoQa1VtTdI_17 0 YOU KICK WITH THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT OR THE INSIDE OF YOUR FOOT
gFAw9JA-pQc_17 0 NUMBER FOUR THE BALL FURTHER BACK IN YOUR STANCE
gZXd5wK4rW4_4 0 SO THE PROBLEM WITH HITTING OFF OF THIS IS YOU CAN'T GET THE CLUB UNDERNEATH THE BALL LIKE YOU CAN IN GRASS OR SAND OR EVEN LOOSE IMPEDIMENTS
gZXd5wK4rW4_9 0 AND THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN LOSE A LOT OF STROKES IS WHEN YOU HIT A SKULL WHEN YOU SKULL A BALL YOU CAN GO INTO WATER SAND TREES WHO KNOWS WHERE
gZXd5wK4rW4_8 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO LINE UP LIKE YOU WOULD HIT A NORMAL SHOT BUT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT BEING SUPER RELAXED BECAUSE IF YOU TRY MUSCLE THIS BALL AT ALL WHAT HAPPENS IS OFF HARD PAN THE CLUB HITS THE HARD PAN AND THEN SKIPS INTO THE BACK OF THE BALL PRODUCING A SKULL SHOT
gitlNe_51ho_4 0 OKAY NOW I'M READY TO TAKE THE CLUB BACK PROPERLY AND TO PUT PROPER POWER FROM THE BODY INTO HITTING THE BALL
Gkjo_HGLNs4_7 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO UNDERSTAND ANY OF THAT YOU JUST HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU'RE IN A CERTAIN POSITION AND YOU PUT THE BALL UP THERE OFF OF THE GLASS IT'S GOING TO COME IN AND BOUNCE INTO THE RIM
hJ_CfDvv_sw_22 0 THE BALL WAS THROWN WITHIN HIS ZONE OF CATCHING ABILITY BUT IT SOMEHOW GOT PAST HIM
hJ_CfDvv_sw_20 0 NOW A PASSED BALL IS VERY SIMILAR TO A WILD PITCH
g_cCqfIxhWE_3 0 SO BASICALLY WHAT IT IS IS IT'S TWO PLAYERS WHO TURN THEIR STICKS WITH THE BACKS TOWARDS EACH OTHER WITH THE BALL IN THE MIDDLE AND YOU HAVE BOTH HANDS ON THE STICK AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GET UP UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND FLING THE BALL ABOVE YOUR HEADS AND THEN ALL THE TEAMMATES KIND OF MOVE IN TO TRY TO GET THE BALL AND GRAB POSSESSION
hF48m-fxAGo_7 0 AND I'LL SQUEEZE IT A LITTLE BIT SO THAT I CAN GET THIS BALL MOIST AND THEN I'LL TAKE MY RIGHT HAND AND PUSH TOWARDS MY LEFT HAND AND UP AND THEN DOWN USING THE HEEL OF MY LEFT HAND TO KEEP THAT CLAY FROM PUSHING OUT VERY FAR
hF48m-fxAGo_2 0 FIRST YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR BALL OF CLAY AND YOU WANT IT TO BE AS ROUND AS POSSIBLE THAT MAKES CENTERING MUCH EASIER AND THROW IT DOWN PRETTY HARD RIGHT ON THE CENTER OF THE WHEEL
HbQDnZ3-X3I_2 0 THE OVERHEAD PASS IS EFFECTIVE DURING THE GAME WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF SPACE BETWEEN YOU AND THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PASS IT TO AND YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO GET IT THERE WITH SOME ZIP SO THAT THE DEFENSE DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO GET IN BETWEEN AND TRY TO STEAL THE BALL
H7JNrI8IDMY_3 0 BUT IF THE BALL IS IN THE AIR AND YOU HIT IT THAT'S A VOLLEY
H7JNrI8IDMY_2 0 ALL A VOLLEY IS IS YOU TAKE A BALL BEFORE IT BOUNCES SO OBVIOUSLY IF A BALL BOUNCES LIKE THIS THAT'S A GROUND STROKE
HiPCZZl51Ww_23 0 WHEN I BRING MY EYES BACK TO THE BALL I GO AHEAD AND HIT IT
GzykffdDnmE_24 0 I HAVE MY BALL JOINT PICKLE FORK
GzykffdDnmE_26 0 OF COURSE A BALL JOINT PRESS WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE TO CHANGE THIS GUY
GzykffdDnmE_27 0 AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A PARTICULAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LOWER BALL JOINT AND THE UPPER BALL JOINT CONTROL ARM ASSEMBLY
GzykffdDnmE_28 0 THE CONTROL ARM ASSEMBLY HAS THE BALL JOINT ALREADY PRESSED IN IT
gqPmI__5g2k_2 0 WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR FEET TOGETHER YOU TRY TO JOIN THE TOES TOGETHER THE BALL OF THE FOOT THE HEEL OF THE FOOT
H764PyicDGo_2 0 NOW CLUB JUGGLING TRICKS ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM BALL JUGGLING TRICKS
h_8Tw2-93JY_18 0 ALRIGHT SO WE HANDLED THE TOP LET'S HANDLE THE BOTTOM HALF I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND HOLD THE BALL RIGHT BEHIND ME EXTENDING MY ARMS AWAY FROM ME
HbQDnZ3-X3I_11 0 SO KEEP THAT IN MIND WHENEVER YOU'RE PLAYING BALL THE OVERHEAD PASS IS REALLY EFFECTIVE
gbvMqFhBqSU_2 0 IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CORRECT PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZE VEHICLE
_GtKZbzWBig_12 0 TO GET OUT OF THIS BRING THE WEIGHTS DOWN DROP THE HIPS LIFT THE HEAD AND WALK YOURSELF BACK UP ON THE BALL
HeWsukelbVg_10 0 SO WE CAN SEE HERE THAT WE'VE GOT OUR POWER BALL DISPENSER AN ELEVATOR A DOOR THAT'S BLOCKING A POWER BALL RECEPTACLE AND ANOTHER ELEVATOR OVER HERE
hGAbXoyb5E4_10 0 SO WHEN WE ARE DOING THIS MOTION OF EXPANDING OUTWARD WE HAVE TO ALSO BE THINKING WE'RE EXPANDING DOWN WE'RE EXPANDING BACK WE'RE EXPANDING UP IT'S LIKE A BALL OR I LIKE TO SEE IT AS A SUN EXPLODING OUTWARD
Gz_i5gyj6Ck_7 0 AND BUT YOU WANT TO LOB IT UP AND GIVE THE PLAYER ENOUGH TIME TO CATCH THE BALL AND DELIVER INTO THE BASKET WITH VORACITY
hg0PYALmd64_2 0 SO A DRAW ONCE AGAIN IS TAKING THE BALL FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
hg0PYALmd64_3 0 IT'S A WAY OF AVOIDING A LOT OF TROUBLES IN YOUR WAY AND ALSO GETTING THE BALL IF THE GREEN IS HEAVILY BUNKERED AND THE PIN'S ON THE LEFT SIDE THIS IS A WAY OF TRACKING THE BALL TOWARD THE PIN
hg0PYALmd64_6 0 SO IT'S GOING TO GET EASIER AND EASIER TO HOOK THE BALL
hg0PYALmd64_5 0 SO YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE NORMAL UNDER SPIN OF STRIKING A BALL BUT WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE THE FACE LIKE THIS TO CREATE SOME SIDE SPIN SO THE BALL WILL SPIN AND GO TO THE LEFT
hg0PYALmd64_8 0 SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS THIS IS HOW YOU LINE UP FOR THE NORMAL STRAIGHT BALL
gvKIJCe5zXY_10 0 SO AGAIN YOU'RE PLACING THE BALL IN FRONT OF YOU PUSHING DOWN THROUGH THE HANDS EXTENDING OUT THROUGH THE HIPS AND THEN DRIVING THE ELBOWS INTO THE SIDE
gT35PHYO7rE_28 0 SO IF MY HANDS DON'T HIT THE BALL AT THE EXACT SAME TIME IT'S AN ILLEGAL HIT
gT35PHYO7rE_29 0 SO A SETTING DRILLS YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A TOSSER WHO WILL TOSS YOU THE BALL AND YOU GET UNDER IT YOU USE YOUR LEGS FACE YOUR TARGET AND YOU WANT TO PUSH THE BALL OUT WITH YOUR NOT ONLY YOUR WRISTS BUT YOUR LEGS ALSO AND FACE YOUR TARGET AND TRY TO GET IT IN THE TARGET
gT35PHYO7rE_23 0 SO WHEN YOU ARE SETTING THE BALL YOU WANT TO TAKE THE BALL AND SHAPE YOUR HANDS IN THE SHAPE OF A BALL
h_aRZFWVAGw_25 0 OK MAKE SURE YOUR HANDS STAY FIRMLY ON THE MEDICINE BALL
gY2MSxD4-s4_7 0 YOU USE ENGLISH TO CONTROL THE ANGLES THAT A BALL COMES OFF OF A CUSHION NOT THE ANGLES THAT IT COMES OFF OF ANOTHER BALL
gY2MSxD4-s4_4 0 BUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR THIS TIME IS WHAT ANGLE DOES THE CUE BALL COME OFF OF THE CUSHION
gY2MSxD4-s4_1 0 OKAY IN THE LAST SEGMENT WE LEARNED THAT USING ENGLISH DOES NOT HELP US CONTROL THE DIRECTION THAT A CUE BALL COMES OFF OF AN OBJECT BALL AT AN ANGLE
G6BlRfRrNt8_2 0 SO I'M JUST GOING TO HIT THE BALL SOFTLY TO DARREN AND HE'S GOING TO HIT IT SOFTLY BACK TO ME
G6BlRfRrNt8_4 0 THIS WILL TEACH YOU HOW TO KEEP THE BALL IN PLAY AND TO HIT YOUR TARGETS
GOFFH6-NGkA_4 0 THIS NEEDS TO GO UP SO THAT NEEDS TO GO DOWN AND NOW YOU HAVE A NICE BALL OF CLAY AND THAT SHOULD HAVE NO AIR BUBBLES IN IT AND THIS IS HOW YOU CHECK IT AND THIS IS HOW YOU GET BETTER AT WEDGING TOO
GIe5C5GIxf0_8 0 SO IF I'M THROWING A THREE BALL PATTERN EACH THROW IS A THREE OF COURSE THE AVERAGE IS THREE
GIe5C5GIxf0_3 0 NOW WHEN YOU JUGGLE A THREE BALL PATTERN THAT'S JUST THREE THREE THREE CONTINUING
GIe5C5GIxf0_4 0 SO EACH THROW IS A THREE BALL HEIGHT AND THEY JUST CROSS LIKE THIS
gt8UTJAB9Tc_3 0 WHEN IT COMES TO THE SOCCER BALL THE SOCCER BALL NEEDS TO BE 68 TO SEVENTY CM IN DIAMETER AND IT WILL HAVE ABOUT 410 TO 450 GRAMS OF WEIGHT IN THERE SO THAT IT REALLY DOESN'T WEIGH TOO MUCH
gH1sh_ECCcY_15 0 WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS YOU HAVE TO GO GET THE BALL
gH1sh_ECCcY_14 0 IF THE BALL GOES OFF THE RIGHT RIDE YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACK THE RIGHT SIDE
gqcqN86jHhQ_17 0 WRIST UP BRING THE BALL UP AND ABOUT HERE I WILL RELEASE THE BALL
gqcqN86jHhQ_15 0 RIGHT ABOUT WHEN YOU ARE ABOUT THIS DISTANCE YOU RELEASE THE BALL SO THE BALL GOES
gqcqN86jHhQ_10 0 YOU WANT TO START THE SERVE WITH THE BALL UNDER THE NET JUST AS I HAVE IT
g_cCqfIxhWE_7 0 SO THE REFEREE WILL PLACE THE BALL IN THE BACK OF YOUR STICK AND YOU SET UP AND YOU'LL WAIT FOR THE WHISTLE BUT WE'RE JUST GOING TO COUNT TO THREE OKAY
gbvJRSW0RPc_2 0 BECAUSE IT'S THE CLUB HEAD THAT HITS THE BALL AND THE BALL KNOWS ALL AND THE ONLY THING THE BALL KNOWS IS IMPACT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THERE BUT IF YOU COULD WATCH THE CLUB HEAD AT HOME IN PRACTICE SWINGS IN YOUR BACKYARD
HeBgFmC7egw_10 0 THE REASON YOU WANT TO CLAP IS BECAUSE YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW HIGH TO TOSS THE BALL UP TO GIVE YOU ENOUGH TIME TO CATCH IT
hiIHTYpRh8Y_11 0 SO YOU GOT TO BE REAL LOOSE YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR FEET AND YOUR KNEES BENT AND JUST NICE AND RELAXED AND JUST GET UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND LET THE CLUB DO THE WORK AND YOU'LL HAVE GREAT SUCCESS
HeBySQSIl5k_17 0 THROW THROW THROW THROW AND THIS IS OUR THREE BALL CASCADE PATTERN
HeBySQSIl5k_13 0 WE ADD THE THIRD BALL AND THE PATTERN HERE WILL JUST BE SOLID THROWS
gZXd5wK4rW4_5 0 SO THIS IS A TOUGH LIE BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE TO TRY TO GET UNDERNEATH THE BALL A LITTLE BIT TO GET IT UP
gZXd5wK4rW4_6 0 SO WHAT YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO DO HERE IS TO PICK THE BALL CLEANLY OFF THIS SURFACE BECAUSE IT IS ALMOST LIKE HITTING OFF OF CONCRETE
GPYYGaoy0IM_17 0 SO WHEN YOU GET A BAD LIE IN FAIRWAY SAND JUST SAY OKJUST TAKE THE APPROPRIATE CLUB AND JUST PITCH THE BALL OUT OF THERE SO YOU LIVE TO SWING ANOTHER DAY
GbfVUIaWAew_5 0 YOU'RE GOING TO GET A SCOOP OR A BALL OF ACRYLIC POWDER OUT AND APPLY TO THE NAIL
_HimJAL58fo_6 0 THE WAY THIS TECHNIQUE WORKS WITH AN OPPONENT IS I PUNCH WITH THE LEFT AND BLOCK WITH THE LEFT HAND SHOOT THE RIGHT LEG IN KIND OF LIKE YOU WERE GOING TO KICK THE LOWER LEG EXCEPT YOU ARE GOING TO PASS BY BRING THE RIGHT LEG AROUND AND HIT WITH THE HEEL OR THE BALL OF THE FOOT
GbLshtiLaIs_13 0 I NOW HAVE A SHOT ON THE EIGHT BALL
GbLshtiLaIs_11 0 A DRAW SHOT AGAIN IS ONE WHERE I'M GOING TO POCKET THAT BALL AND I'M GOING TO MAKE THAT CUE BALL COME BACK TOWARDS ME
Hi_OjLrFAdg_10 0 YOU DON'T NEED AN EXPENSIVE PAIR OF CLEATS YOU DON'T NEED A FANCY JERSEY JUST THE BALL AND THE ABILITY TO HAVE A GOOD TIME
g_cCqfIxhWE_4 0 AND SO TO WIN A DRAW YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE STURDY THAT YOUR LEGS ARE PLANTED FIRMLY AND YOU WANT TO HAVE A GOOD GRIP ON YOUR STICK AND THE WAY YOU WIN IT IS GET UNDERNEATH THE BALL REALLY QUICK AND HIT UP
GVWXveM_fzE_14 0 SO WORK ON THAT AND YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD FOUR BALL START
hgZ_GabeHAQ_11 0 YOU CAN DO A STEADY ONE FINGER PRESSURE JUST STAYING IN THAT PLACE OR YOU CAN DO A CIRCULAR MOTION WITH YOUR THUMB OR WITH THE BALL OF YOUR FINGER
gupPatBYC4I_8 0 ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AS WELL THERE WILL BE A BEAD ANY PART OF THE STICK RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE BALL IS GOING TO BE INSIDE AGAINST THE MILK CARTOON SO YOU REALLY WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING THE STICK DIRTY WHILE YOU'RE PAINTING IT
gupPatBYC4I_6 0 THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOING TO BE SEEN FROM THE OUTSIDE IS BASICALLY THE BALL ITSELF
gupPatBYC4I_7 0 ON THE TOP PART THERE'S GOING TO BE A BEAD PLACED ON IT SO THAT IT THE BALL WILL SIT SECURELY AND WON'T FALL OFF THE STICK
gupPatBYC4I_4 0 SO IT'S ALSO EASY TO PAINT IT WHILE IT'S ON THE STICK BECAUSE A BALL IS HARD TO GRIP WHILE PAINTING IT SO THIS WAY IT GIVES US A WAY TO HOLD ONTO THE BALL AND GET ALL SIDES UNDERNEATH AND ON TOP ALL AROUND THE BALL VERY EASILY WHILE IT'S ON THE STICK

gyM46ZenVQ4_6 0 HOWEVER IF YOU DON'T BREAK PROPERLY AND SAY YOU SCRATCH ON THE BREAK OR YOU DON'T POCKET A BALL ALL YOU'RE DOING AT THAT POINT IS JUST TURNING CONTROL OVER THE TABLE TO YOUR OPPONENT
gyM46ZenVQ4_5 0 SO THE OBJECTIVE ON THE BREAK IS TO OF COURSE POCKET AT LEAST ONE BALL WHICH IS THEN GOING TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY AT THE TABLE AND TRY TO POCKET MORE BALLS

h351h1Blzhk_4 0 WHAT I LIKE TO SAY TO THE STUDENTS IS THINK OF A BASE OF A TRIANGLE AND YOU WANT TO GET THE BALL RIGHT OVER YOUR HEAD TO THE A PASS

gFAw9JA-pQc_20 0 IF YOU PUT THAT TOGETHER I GUARANTEE YOU ARE GOING TO HOOK THE BALL
HbCcyacx4io_8 0 YOU WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THOUGH THAT THE NETS REALLY DO HAVE A PURPOSE SO IF YOU'RE SETTING UP YOUR OWN BASKETBALL HOOP AT HOME YOU WANT TO DEFINITELY PUT A NET UP IT PREVENTS THE BALL FROM GOING OUT OF BOUNDS AND YOU HAVING TO CHASE IT DOWN ALL OVER THE PLACE
HbCcyacx4io_7 0 NOW ALSO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PLAYING BALL THE BRACE LOTS OF TIMES YOU'LL SEE A POLE LIKE THIS WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING OUTDOORS OR YOU'LL SEE AN ACTUAL COMBINATION OF THINGS BRACING THE BACKBOARD UP IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT INDOORS
GrnggJJBZ4Y_7 0 IT DEPENDS ON HOW BIG THE BALL IS GOING TO BE THAT WE'RE USING FOR HIS EYE
gb8IQZH_7EM_10 0 IT EARLIER WAS PLAYED WITH PING-PONG PADDLES LIKE A TABLE TENNIS GAME AND THAT TURNED IN TO WHERE YOU JUST THROW THE BALL INTO THE CUP WHICH MADE IT A LOT EASIER AND YOU DRUNK A LOT QUICKER HONESTLY

h1ogj1cUvDw_9 0 FROM COMING UP HERE WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE BALL OUTSIDE THE COURT ON THIS SIDE TO COME IN A LITTLE MORE BACK AND CORRECT THAT MISTAKE YOU'RE MAKING
h1ogj1cUvDw_3 0 SO JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU KEEP YOUR ELBOWS CLOSE TO YOUR BODY AND YOU CONTACT THE BALL AT THIS POINT IN FRONT OF YOU
h1ogj1cUvDw_2 0 AGAIN NORMALLY HAPPENS ON THE BACKHAND SIDE BECAUSE WE ARE MOVING OUR BODY FORWARD AND WHEN WE'RE AIMING THE BALL AS YOU CAN SEE MY FACE OF THE RACQUET IS LOOKING OVER THERE INSTEAD OF LOOKING IN FRONT OF ME AND IT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE MY WRIST IS GIVING UP MY LEFT WRIST IS GIVING UP OR MY BODIES GOING FORWARD
h1ogj1cUvDw_6 0 IF YOUR BALL IS GOING TOO MUCH TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE COURT THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE HITTING IT PROBABLY TOO MUCH IN FRONT OF YOU
gxS9dFUSd90_8 0 WE ARE GOING TO DO THE BACKHAND VOLLEY AND GARY IS GOING TO HIT A BACKHAND DRIVE TO ME SO THIS IS A GOOD ANGLE TO SEE HOW GARY PREPARES THE RACQUET TURNS THE SHOULDER AND STEPS INTO THE BALL AND IT IS ALSO GOING TO BE GOOD TO WATCH HOW I KEEP MY RACQUET UP AND I VOLLEY THE BALL GENTLY BY JUST OPENING THE FACE AND PUTTING IT BACK ON THE WALL
gxS9dFUSd90_9 0 SO LOOK AT HOW GARY JUST TURNS AND SITS THE BALL PRETTY EFFORTLESSLY STRAIGHT AND I JUST KEEP THE RACQUET OPEN AND IT REALLY DOESN'T TAKE MUCH WORK TO GET THE BALL BACK SO I HAVE DEVELOPED MY DROPPED VOLLEY AND GARY DEVELOPS HIS DRIVE AND IT IS QUITE A WORK OUT TOO
gxS9dFUSd90_6 0 WATCH HOW GARY STEPS INTO THE BALL
gxS9dFUSd90_1 0 ON THIS SEGMENT WE ARE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW IT LOOKS FROM ANOTHER ANGLE SO I WANT YOU TO TAKE NOTE OF HOW GARY TURNS AND GETS THE RACKET READY STEPS INTO THE BALL AND HITS IT BACK TO ME AND THEN NOTICE HOW I OPEN THE FACE OF THE RACQUET AND LOFT IT BACK SO HE CAN HIT IT BACK AGAIN
gcj62_Y5fHA_4 0 IN OTHER WORDS THAT'S THE ACTION THAT WE REALLY WANT ON THE CUE BALL IS NO ACTION AT ALL
gcj62_Y5fHA_6 0 WHAT WE WANT IT TO DO IS SLIDE INTO THAT BALL
gcj62_Y5fHA_7 0 BECAUSE IF IT SLIDES STRAIGHT IN TO THE OBJECT BALL WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THE CUE BALL IS GOING TO IMPART ALL OF IT'S ENERGY TO THE OBJECT BALL SENDING THE OBJECT BALL ON ITS WAY AND THE CUE BALL IS GOING TO LOSE EVERYTHING IT'S GOT GOING FOR IT AND IT'S GOING TO STOP DEAD STILL
gcj62_Y5fHA_1 0 OK OUR NEXT SHOT ON OUR THREE MOST BASIC CUE BALL POSITIONS SHOTS IS THE STOP SHOT
gcj62_Y5fHA_2 0 AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF AN ACTION DO WE NEED TO HAVE ON THE CUE BALL ON CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT BALL IN ORDER TO GET IT TO STOP
gcj62_Y5fHA_3 0 AND I'M JUST GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO BE LOOKING FOR ON EVERY STOP SHOT REGARDLESS OF DISTANCE IS YOU WANT TO BE TRYING TO CATCH THE CUE BALL IN IT'S SLIDE
gcj62_Y5fHA_8 0 SO FROM THIS POSITION RIGHT HERE IN ORDER TO SLIDE THIS BALL FROM THERE TO THERE IT SHOULD BE A SIMPLE MATTER OF HITTING IT RIGHT AT THE CENTER
gT35PHYO7rE_26 0 YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR HANDS TOUCH THE BALL AT THE EXACT SAME TIME
gT35PHYO7rE_24 0 SO WHEN YOU ARE SETTING THE BALL TAKE THE BALL ABOVE YOUR HEAD WHERE IF YOU MISS THE BALL IT WILL HIT YOU IN YOUR FOREHEAD
gT35PHYO7rE_25 0 SO YOU TAKE THE BALL AND SET AND IT CAN NOT STAY IN YOUR HANDS VERY LONG SO YOU WANT TO GET IT OUT ALMOST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
gT35PHYO7rE_20 0 SO THE SETTER IS GOING TO SET YOU THE BALL YOU TAKE YOUR APPROACH JUMP UP AND HIT IT OVER THE NET
GLGwxXx74u8_2 0 WELL THE MAIN POINT IN ALL OF YOUR SQUASH IS TO GET BACK TO THE TEE AREA RIGHT HERE SO WHEN I SERVE IF I SERVE AN OVER HEAD SERVE I WANT TO WATCH THE BALL AND I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE TEE
GLGwxXx74u8_9 0 WHETHER I SERVE BACKHANDED AND IF I SERVE A NICE SLOW BALL I CAN ALMOST WALK TO THE TEE AND IF I HIT IT A LITTLE HARDER I'VE GOT TO GET READY BUT GETTING TO THE TEE AFTER YOU HIT YOUR SERVE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU CAN DO
GLGwxXx74u8_8 0 WATCH WHAT MY FEET DO AND I MOVE RIGHT OVER SO BEFORE THE BALL IS EVEN TO MY OPPONENT I AM BACK AT THE TEE
gFZiilQMutQ_7 0 WE WILL JUST BE ABLE TO SHUT OFF THAT BALL VALVE

Heh3jXWjXGU_3 0 IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A VOIDED BALL
G_q2GdcAglE_22 0 SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS PUT A BALL ON THE TOP OF THE CLUB LOOK AT THAT BALL
gh6J2QPQPJE_5 0 SOMETIMES DEFENDERS ARE GOING TO CLOSE RIGHT OUT ON YOU AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A HAND ON THE BALL AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET A SHOT AWAY
G6RqcJ7rSKY_3 0 YOU WANT TO SLIGHT BENDING THE KNEES FEET HIP WIDTH APART AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP TO THAT BALL OF YOUR FOOT WITHOUT LETTING GRAVITY PULL YOU FORWARD
HAagj_I2R_0_9 0 SO WE HAVE ONE BALL TWO ONE UP TWO UP
HAagj_I2R_0_3 0 THIS IS OUR NORMAL THREE BALL PATTERN AND WE THROW ONE STRAIGHT UP THEN WE THROW THE OTHER TWO STRAIGHT UP
HeBySQSIl5k_23 0 LIKE THIS WHERE ONE BALL IS CONTINUOUSLY CROSSING OVER THE TOP OF THE OTHERS
HeBySQSIl5k_25 0 WHERE EVERY BALL IS CROSSING OVER THE BALL IN FRONT OF IT
HeBySQSIl5k_29 0 NEXT WE'LL BE MOVING ON TO SOME MORE ADVANCED BALL TRICKS
HePfkV3d6X4_8 0 AS FAR AS FLIGHT PATHS EVERYTHING IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO THREE BALL JUGGLING EXCEPT YOU HAVE THE ADDED COMPLEXITY OF THE CLUB SPINNING AND YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH THE RIGHT END
gDGrAAY42rE_6 0 ANOTHER WAY TO CLEAN THINGS YOU CAN DO THIS WITH THE PENS AS WELL IS TO JUST TAKE A PIECE OF PAPER AND GO LIKE THIS OF COURSE I CAN OPEN THIS UP A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT THAT'S HOW YOU WOULD CLEAN THE INSIDE ALSO WITH THOSE SPEED BALL PENS
gJpKOK4X3MI_11 0 OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT AS WELL USE A TENNIS BALL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
h_8Tw2-93JY_22 0 OBVIOUSLY AT THIS POINT THE BALL IS JUST A BRACE SO YOU DON'T NEED TO NECESSARILY INCREASE THE WEIGHT OF THE BALL BUT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF REPS ALRIGHT THE OBLIQUES
g4m9I6gdaaE_15 0 YOU'RE GOING TO TWIST YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER AND YOU'RE GOING TO TURN YOUR RIGHT FOOT OUT ON THE HEEL AND YOU'RE GOING TO ALLOW THE LEFT TOE TO TURN ON THE BALL OF THE FOOT
giK5yGgIq9Q_3 0 SO YOU'RE OPEN STANCE YOU KNOW THE BALL IS FORWARD ON YOU AND IF YOU HAVE TO GO FORWARD YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE THAT OPEN STANCE TOO MUCH
giK5yGgIq9Q_2 0 AND WHEN TO USE THIS WHAT KIND OF BALL TO USE THIS ON AND HOW TO RECOVER THERE OFF THAT
giK5yGgIq9Q_7 0 AND THIS IS FOR A BALL THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DEEPER THAT YOU'RE GOING TO JUST TO WANT TO YOU KNOW SAVE YOUR YOUR STEPS AND NOT HAVE TOO MANY
GJFwVmnM5kY_1 0 KNEELING SIDE CRUNCH WITH BALL WITH FITNESS BALL SUPPORT
GJFwVmnM5kY_4 0 ANYWAY IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE POSITIONING OF THE BALL I RECOMMEND THAT YOU WATCH THE CLIP WITH THE POSITIONING SO YOU LEARN HOW TO GET THE BALL CORRECTLY
GbLshtiLaIs_1 0 THE LAST IN OUR THREE BASIC CUE BALL POSITION SHOTS IS THE DRAW SHOT
GbLshtiLaIs_3 0 WHERE WHAT WE'RE WANTING TO DO IS PULL THE CUE BALL BACK TOWARDS US
GbLshtiLaIs_4 0 IN OTHER WORDS IF WE HAD THIS SET UP RIGHT HERE IN OUR GAME OF EIGHT BALL ONCE AGAIN
GbLshtiLaIs_5 0 THIS IS MY LAST OBJECT BALL ON THE TABLE
GbLshtiLaIs_7 0 BUT AGAIN IF I'M GOING TO STOP MY CUE BALL RIGHT THERE THAT'S NOT GOING TO GIVE ME A GOOD SHOT
GbLshtiLaIs_8 0 IF I FOLLOW ALONG BEHIND IT THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING FOR ME MY EIGHT BALL IS WAY OVER HERE
GbLshtiLaIs_9 0 SO I NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE CUE BALL TO BRING IT BACK TO GIVE ME AN EASY SHOT ON THE EIGHT BALL
h_8Tw2-93JY_6 0 I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE SOME CRUNCHES WITH THE MEDICINE BALL
h_8Tw2-93JY_3 0 WITH THAT IN MIND I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE SOME MEDICINE BALL EXERCISES AND OF COURSE AS YOU GET STRONGER YOU INCREASE RESISTANCE BY GETTING A BIGGER HEAVIER MEDICINE BALL
h_8Tw2-93JY_8 0 HOLDING THE BALL RIGHT AT MY CHEST I TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN
H7JNrI8IDMY_11 0 INSTEAD OF HITTING EACH OTHER YOU'RE HITTING THE BALL
H7JNrI8IDMY_13 0 SO YOU TAKE THE BALL YOU TAKE THE RACKET YOU OPEN THE FACE AND YOU JUST BLOCK IT AGAINST THE WALL AND THAT'S A FOREHAND VOLLEY RIGHT THERE
H7JNrI8IDMY_17 0 IT FORCES ME TO PREPARE MY RACKET SO YOU SEE I HIT THE BALL I CAN'T HAVE THE RACKET JUST DROP DEAD
Gv4uy35II0M_12 0 YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE THIS A LITTLE MORE PRONOUNCED THAN YOUR CAT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER TO SEE SO UNDERNEATH HERE I'M GOING TO HAVE SOME SHADOWING GOING ON UNDERNEATH THE BALL ON THE UNDERSIDE BUT I'M NOT GOING TO EXTEND IT ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP SO EXPERIMENT HOWEVER YOU LIKE WITH THE SHADOWING
ggbxWDFleYc_5 0 SO WHEN WE DO DRIBBLE IF WE'RE PLAYING A GAME AND SOMEBODY ACTUALLY THROWS US THE BALL WELL WHAT DO WE DO
ggbxWDFleYc_7 0 WE CAN SHOOT THE BALL WE CAN PASS THE BALL TO ONE OF OUR TEAMMATES OR WE CAN DRIBBLE
gHcCsvCSuI8_4 0 YOU DON'T WANT TO PALM THE BALL
gHcCsvCSuI8_2 0 FIRST THING YOU WANT TO CONSIDER IS JUST THE GRIP OF THE BALL
gHcCsvCSuI8_3 0 YOU KNOW MAYBE FIND THE THE SEAMS AND DEPENDING ON HOW BIG YOUR HANDS ARE YOU KNOW THE THUMB OF THE BALL OR THE THUMB ON ONE OF THE SEAMS AND THEN THREE AT LEAST THREE YOU KNOW OF YOUR FIRST FINGERS ON THE THE OUTSIDE OF THE SEAMS
G_leenn4ZPM_12 0 SO IF MY TEAM SERVES THE BALL BUT YET THE OTHER TEAM GETS THE BALL AND PUTS IT INTO OUR SIDE OF THE COURT THEY GET THE POINT EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T SERVE THE BALL AND VICE VERSA
h0Gfjk_apOY_14 0 YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO THROW THAT BALL UP IN AN ARK AND HAVE IT LAND IN THIS HAND WITHOUT THAT MUCH TROUBLE
h0Gfjk_apOY_12 0 WHAT WE WANT TO DO IT TO CREATE AN ARK SO THAT AT THE TOP OF THE BOX THE BALL GOES UP OVER IN A ARK AND ENDS UP IN YOUR OPPOSITE HAND
h0Gfjk_apOY_13 0 YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS MUCH IN A SAME WAY THAT WE WERE THROWING THE ONE BALL UP AND CATCHING IT IN THE SAME SPOT
gFAw9JA-pQc_15 0 NUMBER THREE GET YOUR HANDS IN FRONT OF THE BALL
gm9xAQEhc44_20 0 IF YOU BOX OUT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE FEELING CONTACT FIRST BEFORE YOU GO FOR THE BALL
gm9xAQEhc44_21 0 IF YOU JUST GO FOR THE BALL WITHOUT ESTABLISHING CONTACT A REALLY SMART PLAYER LIKE MYSELF WILL SLIDE IN FRONT OF YOU AND BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THE POSITION
gxwT5v4wbfQ_7 0 YOUR CUE STICK WILL BE ELEVATED IN THE BACK WHICH YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WILL MASSE A BALL IF YOU PUT ANY ENGLISH ON IT
gxwT5v4wbfQ_6 0 YOU HAVE TO MAKE A BRIDGE THAT'S UP ON YOUR FINGERTIPS SO THAT YOU'LL BE OVER THE BALL
gxwT5v4wbfQ_5 0 NOW WHAT MAKES IT SO DIFFICULT IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE TO ELEVATE THE END OF YOUR CUE STICK IF YOU DO NOT HIT DEAD CENTER ON THE BALL WHATEVER ENGLISHES THAT YOU WILL ACCIDENTALLY PUT ON THE CUE BALL WILL MAGNIFY BECAUSE IT'LL BE A SLIGHT MASSE SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HIT THE CENTER OF THE BALL OR IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON USING ENGLISH TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALLOW FOR IT
gxwT5v4wbfQ_4 0 OCCASIONALLY WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING YOU GET LEFT A SHOT WHERE THE CUE BALL IS CLOSE TO ANOTHER BALL OR YOU PLAYED POSITION AND YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED IT VERY WELL AND YOU'VE GOT TO SHOOT OVER A BALL
gxwT5v4wbfQ_3 0 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO SHOOT OVER AN OBJECT BALL
gxwT5v4wbfQ_9 0 AND THAT'S HOW YOU SHOOT OVER A BALL
gxwT5v4wbfQ_8 0 SO NOW YOU TAKE YOUR STROKES AND YOU JUST SHOOT OVER THE BALL AND YOU MAKE THE BALL IN IN THE POCKET
gupfjA4s7Q4_2 0 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO HERE JONESY'S GOING TO DO SOME MEDICINE BALL PUSH UPS WHILE RYAN IS GOING TO DO SOME PUSH UPS USING THE KETTLEBELLS JUST TO HELP THE RANGE OF MOTION IN HIS CHEST
Gje0P7J9pSw_3 0 FOR THE LONG TAIL CAST ON TAKE YOUR YARN AND GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF LENGTH TO THE SHORT END PLACE THAT OVER YOUR THUMB AND THEN THE OTHER END ATTACH TO THE BALL OVER YOUR POINTER FINGER
Gkjo_HGLNs4_2 0 BANK SHOTS ARE NOT ONLY PRETTY BUT THEY'RE EFFECTIVE AND THEY'RE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE SHOT WHEN YOU USE THEM PROPERLY THAN JUST SHOOTING THE BALL AT THE RIM
GGtx4BS5sJ8_6 0 SO GET ON THE BALL WITH THAT
GJrc-igSJX4_1 0 YOU KNOW AN IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR GAME HAS GOT TO BE THE BALL HANDLING
GJrc-igSJX4_2 0 AND WHENEVER YOU'RE DOING THAT BALL HANDLING YOU'VE GOT TO DO DRILLS AND PRACTICE IN ORDER TO GET GOOD AT IT
GJrc-igSJX4_3 0 HI I'M TRAVIS AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU JUST HOW TO PERFECT AND GET BETTER AT BALL HANDLING IN SEVEN MINUTES A DAY
GJrc-igSJX4_6 0 ALRIGHT THE FIRST BALL HANDLING DRILL I WANT TO SHOW YOU IS ONCE YOU HAVE THE BALL YOU WANT TO TAKE THE BALL BRING IT DOWN BELOW YOUR ANKLES START DOWN BELOW YOUR ANKLES AND GO AROUND YOUR ANKLE WAIST HEAD WAIST ANKLE WAIST HEAD WAIST ANKLE AND YOU JUST GO FASTER AND FASTER KIND OF LIKE THIS
h35T7XMLKrY_2 0 NOW THIS IS A MEDIUM TO EASY BALL JUGGLING PATTERN WHEN YOU DO IT WITH THREE
h35T7XMLKrY_3 0 ALL YOU'RE DOING INSTEAD OF CATCHING AND THROWING LIKE THIS YOU'RE GOING TO TURN YOUR HAND OVER AND GRAB THE BALL FROM THE TOP
h35T7XMLKrY_6 0 BUT JUST WORK ON THAT WITH BOTH HANDS AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE ADD IT INTO YOUR THREE BALL PATTERN
gupfjA4s7Q4_6 0 WHAT JONESY'S DOING HERE IS THAT HE'S PUSHING THE BALL BACK AND FORTH
G4vpUQzxaGs_6 0 FOR A DEEPER STRETCH PULL THE BALL UP TO YOUR LEG
GuBHuLTwVwE_12 0 TOSS THE BALL
GuBHuLTwVwE_15 0 THEY THEN WILL TOSS THE BALL TO SOMEONE ELSE IN THE CIRCLE AND THEY HAVE THREE SECONDS TO COME UP WITH ANOTHER SPORT NAME
Hiksl7JI3mw_3 0 TAKE THAT RIGHT FOOT UP AND TAKE THAT STRAP AROUND THE BALL OF THE FOOT AND THEN EQUALIZE THE LENGTH OF THE STRAP AND AS YOU EQUALIZE THE LENGTH OF THE STRAP SECURE IT AROUND YOUR RIGHT HAND SO YOU HAVE A GOOD FIRM GRIP
Gx6CxnX79jg_11 0 SO BASICALLY YOU'RE GOING AROUND LIKE THIS WITH YOUR THUMBS AT THE BOTTOM AND YOUR INDEX FINGERS AT THE TOP PRESSING IN THE TOP OF THE BALL TO GIVE IT THE APPEARANCE OF A MUSHROOM CAP
gSiLajKc2Ys_1 0 ALICE MONSAERT THIS STABILITY BALL EXERCISE IS GOING TO TARGET THE OBLIQUES WHICH RUN ON THE SIDE OF THE WAIST
gSiLajKc2Ys_3 0 I'LL TAKE A KNEELING POSITION AND BEGIN TO PULL THE BALL INTO MY HIP AND PLACE THE HIP ON TOP OF THE BALL THEN LEAN OVER AND I'M JUST PLACED MY HAND AT THE SIDE AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS REDUCE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN MY RIBCAGE AND MY HIP
gSiLajKc2Ys_9 0 AND IF I CAN DROP OVER THE BALL EVEN MORE THEN I'M GETTING MORE RANGE OF MOTION AND MORE INTENSITY ON THAT MUSCLE GROUP
gjinS7HdM2Q_10 0 THEN FROM HERE I CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND STROKE THE BALL
gnPKGPaPTZ8_17 0 LET'S USE THE BLUE BALL
h5Tc0QPiB_o_6 0 IF YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS REVERSED AND HE'S TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE HAND OFF ON THE WRONG SIDE AND YOU HAVE YOUR ELBOW OUT THERE CHANCES ARE YOU'RE GOING TO HIT WITH YOUR ARM AND YOU'RE GOING TO KNOCK THE BALL LOOSE FROM THE QUARTERBACK
h5Tc0QPiB_o_4 0 ONE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE RIGHT WAY TO WRAP UP THE BALL IF YOU TAKE THE HAND OFF IN THE WRONG WAY
h5Tc0QPiB_o_5 0 THE SECOND WAY IS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER FOR THE QUARTERBACK TO GIVE YOU THE BALL IF YOU'RE NOT OPENED UP THE PROPER WAY
h5Tc0QPiB_o_9 0 IT HAS TO BE OPEN SO THE QUARTERBACK CAN SLIDE THE BALL IN
h9OYqrhfW98_4 0 HE'S STILL GOING TO USE HIS TECHNIQUE GETTING OFF THE BALL AND EVERYTHING BUT HE'S GOING TO DRAW A LINE STRAIGHT TO THAT FREE SAFETY WHICH IS CALLED STALK BLOCKING
gnL24bqNJqE_23 0 SO BASICALLY NOW YOU'RE READY TO PRACTICE AND THROW A BALL
gt8UTJAB9Tc_4 0 IF THE BALL COMES TO YOU AND YOU GOT A PERSON YOU ARE TRYING TO GO AROUND THEIR DEFENDER REMEMBER GO TO THE SIDE COME AROUND THEM OR YOU JUST CUT BACK WHATEVER
hHQe7R18FNs_2 0 NOW IF YOU REMEMBER FROM BALL JUGGLING A MULTIPLEX IS WHEN YOU THROW MORE THAN ONE BALL AT ONCE OR IN OUR CASE MORE THAN ONE CLUB AT ONCE
GAbc4MyyZyo_11 0 THE OTHER THING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO ESPECIALLY SUCH AS WITH THIS BARREL WHERE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN PAINT A BALL HAS BROKEN IN IT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU BRING ALL THAT DEBRIS OUT
HiPCZZl51Ww_10 0 SO I'M TRYING TO PICK A HIGH POINT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE BALL AND THE HOLE
HiPCZZl51Ww_12 0 JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF HOW HARD THE BALL NEEDS TO BE MOVING HERE FOR IT TO GET TO THE HOLE
GzykffdDnmE_31 0 THAT MAKES IT SO THE BALL JOINT ON THE UPPER SIDE WILL BOLT IN THROUGH YOUR CONTROL ARM BUSHING HOLES
GzykffdDnmE_36 0 IN ORDER TO DO THAT ON A FULL SIZED VEHICLE YOUR GOING TO WANT TO GET A BALL JOINT PRESS
GUPTKqn6eWs_13 0 SO A COUPLE OF KEY POINTERS TO REMEMBER IS YOU'VE GOT YOUR NINETY DEGREE ANGLES WITH YOUR LOWER BODY YOUR SHOULDERS AND YOUR HEAD NEED TO STAY ON THE BALL
GUPTKqn6eWs_10 0 WE DON'T WANT TO BE UP HERE WHERE YOUR LOWER BACK IS ON THE BALL AS YOU ARE PUSHING UP BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO BE PUTTING A LOT OF RESTRAINT IN YOUR NECK SO AS YOU ARE SETTING UP KEEP YOUR FREE WEIGHTS DOWN BY YOUR SIDE AND YOU ARE GOING TO COME FROM A SEATED POSITION TO ROLL YOURSELF ALL THE WAY DOWN UNTIL YOU FEEL YOUR HEAD AND YOUR SHOULDERS TOUCH THE BALL
geseEurhJQ8_7 0 YOUR LEFT SIDE YOUR WEAKER SIDE AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WEAKER IF YOU'RE A RIGHT HANDER TRY THROWING A BALL LEFTY SEE HOW FAR IT GOES
hHaUCcj7Cyo_8 0 AROUND IN A CIRCLE NICE AND CONTROL KEEPING THE BALL RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU
hHaUCcj7Cyo_9 0 A THIRD THING YOU CAN DO IS YOU DO BALL TOUCHES IS STANDING ON ONE SIDE OF THE BALL
hHaUCcj7Cyo_4 0 THE FIRST DRILLS THAT WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF BALL TOUCHES DIFFERENT MOVES
hHaUCcj7Cyo_5 0 THE FIRST ONE IS JUST A SIMPLE BALL TOUCH RIGHT ON THE TOP OF THE BALL
hHaUCcj7Cyo_7 0 THE SECOND THING YOU CAN DO WITH THIS IS YOU CAN GO AROUND THE BALL
hHaUCcj7Cyo_3 0 WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU LEARN HOW TO CONTROL THE BALL AND LEARN HOW TO DRIBBLE
Gx6CxnX79jg_7 0 YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH THIS HALF BALL AND TAKE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PART OF IT AND POINT IT UPWARDS
gJpKOK4X3MI_7 0 MOST OUTDOOR ROLLER HOCKEY PLAYERS WOULD USE A BALL JUST LIKE THIS
gJpKOK4X3MI_3 0 BUT BASICALLY THE BALL MOVES REALLY WELL OUT HERE
gJpKOK4X3MI_1 0 ALRIGHT SINCE WE'RE OUTDOORS WHAT I GOT IS MY ROLLER HOCKEY BALL
Gx6CxnX79jg_4 0 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR BALL WE'RE GOING TO CUT OFF A THIRD OF IT
hiIHTYpRh8Y_4 0 SO IT GIVES YOU THE MOST OPTIONS IF YOU WANT TO GET A LOT OF LOFT ON THE BALL
hiIHTYpRh8Y_5 0 SO IT'S A GREAT WEAPON AND BECAUSE IT'S SO LOFTED THOUGH IT DOES TAKE A LOT OF PRACTICE TO GET IT TO WHERE YOU HAVE GOOD CONTROL WITH IT BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE COMING UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND YOU'RE LEARNING TO POP IT UP TO A GOOD TO THE RIGHT DISTANCE SO YOU GOT TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THE SIXTY DEGREE CLUB BUT IT'S A GREAT CLUB AND LET'S SEE HOW IT GOES HERE
hiIHTYpRh8Y_1 0 OK THE SIXTY DEGREE WEDGE IS REALLY LOFTED AND ONE THING I FORGOT TO MENTION IN PREVIOUS SEGMENTS MAYBE IS THAT IF YOU OPEN THE FACE OF YOUR CLUB IT DOES INCREASE THE LOFT WHICH MEANS IT PUTS THE BALL HIGHER
hiIHTYpRh8Y_9 0 SO THE SIXTY DEGREE WEDGE IS ANOTHER WAY OF LOFTING THE BALL HIGH SO WHEN IT LANDS IT STOPS
GJrc-igSJX4_28 0 THERE YOU HAVE IT SEVEN MINUTES BALL HANDLING
GJrc-igSJX4_23 0 THE NEXT ONE WILL BE PROBABLY FIGURE EIGHT DRIBBLE WHICH TAKE THE BALL DRIBBLE BETWEEN YOUR LEGS IN THE SAME MOTION
GJrc-igSJX4_26 0 TRY THAT THIRTY SECONDS ONE WAY AND THIRTY SECONDS AGAIN FOR THE FINISH UP REP AND THE LAST ONE YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO TRY AND JUST GET ONE ONE BALL MAYBE HAVE A DEFENSIVE MAN AND WORK ON SIMPLY DRIBBLING
hCOPDugNHTU_16 0 SO AND THEN MAKE SURE TO DRAW THE LITTLE BUNNY TAIL POOF BALL POMPOM
_h-gadPrx6Y_8 0 IT THE SAME THING IN GOLF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE GOLF BALL AS YOU FOLLOW THROUGH IT AND NOT LOOK UP UNTIL YOUR SHOULDER FORCES YOU TO LOOK UP
gJBKLgcmnbo_10 0 YOU SHOULD KNOW THE FASTER THE CLUBBING SPEED THE EASIER IT IS TO GET THAT BALL UP IN THE AIR
gJBKLgcmnbo_11 0 AND BASICALLY THE REASON BEHIND THAT IS YOU ARE PUTTING SPIN ON THE GOLF BALL
hDvJjk4oCXo_7 0 GO AHEAD AND SWITCH SIDES POST YOUR FOOT IN THE CENTER OF THE BALANCE TRAINER WITH BOTH HANDS ON THE MEDICINE BALL BODY IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION AND YOU ARE GOING TO PUSH FORWARD INSTEAD OF BACK
hDvJjk4oCXo_4 0 WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO IS SIT BACK IN A SIDE SQUAT POSITION AND PUSH YOUR BALANCE AND YOUR MEDICINE BALL FORWARD
hDvJjk4oCXo_5 0 RELAX YOUR SHOULDERS AND KEEP YOUR HEAD NICE AND LEVEL AND EXHALE AS YOU PUSH THE BALL AWAY FROM YOU
hDvJjk4oCXo_2 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS COME INTO A NICE EVEN ANGLE WITH YOUR BALANCE TRAINER PLACE ONE FOOT AND TRY TO KEEP IT FAIRLY BALANCED IN THE CENTER OF YOUR BALANCE TRAINER BOTH HANDS ON YOUR MEDICINE BALL
hDvJjk4oCXo_8 0 EXHALE AS THE BALL GOES FORWARD AND INHALE ON THE WAY BACK
gDhEbNWoivg_5 0 I'VE SEEN SOME THAT WERE JUST REAL TINY A LITTLE BALL OF THE ARTIFICIAL FIREWOOD
gwL9fYY3zHA_7 0 AS YOU BRING THE BALL DOWN THE FLOOR YOU'VE GOT TO GO AGGRESSIVELY TO TRY TO SCORE
gwL9fYY3zHA_4 0 NUMBER ONE REVERSE THE BALL IT'S THE KEY TO ANY PRESS BREAK
GHocQ-7zyOo_1 0 NOW WE ARE GOING TO DO A DIFFERENT SERVE WHICH IS THE WIDE SERVE SO MY GOAL IS TO HIT THE BALL SOMEWHERE ABOVE MY RACQUET TO NEAR THE RED LINE AND THE REASON BEING WHEN THE BALL HITS IN THAT AREA THE OPPONENT DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF A SHOT
GHocQ-7zyOo_2 0 HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THE BALL OFF THE WALL OR HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET IT BEFORE IT HITS THE WALL SO IF I HIT IT JUST RIGHT HE IS GOING TO HAVE A VERY VERY WEAK SHOT
GHocQ-7zyOo_5 0 SO BY HITTING THE BALL UP HERE MY OPPONENT IS FORCED TO TAKE THE BALL HIGH WITH HIS BACK HAND OR HE HAS TO TAKE THE RISK OF LETTING IT COME OFF THE BACK WALL OR DYING BACK HERE SO THIS IS A VERY VERY EFFECTIVE SHOT SO ONCE YOU HAVE MASTERED THE TECHNICAL SKILLS OF JUST HITTING THE BALL IN A DECENT MANNER YOU WANT TO START INCORPORATING HITTING IT TO SPOTS ON THE SIDE OF THE WALL TO MAKE YOUR SERVE THAT MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE
GHocQ-7zyOo_4 0 RIGHT LIKE THAT SO BY KEEPING THE BALL AT THAT PART OF THE WALL THEY CAN'T ATTACK ME VERY MUCH SO I'LL USE THE BIG BALL
-Gvog-GliMU_2 0 MED BALL CHEST PASS
h2VKacwXr_w_6 0 AS YOU REPEAT THIS EXERCISE AND COME HERE YOUR MUSCLE MEMORY IS GOING TO START DEVELOPING THE HABIT OF HITTING DOWN AND KEEPING THE HANDS AHEAD OF THE CLUB AND IS GOING TO HELP YOU GET A MUCH BETTER CONTACT WITH THE GOLF BALL
h2VKacwXr_w_4 0 MANY TIMES WE SEE AMATEURS JUST HITTING UP ON THE BALL AND HITTING WHERE THE CLUB FACE IS AHEAD OF THE HANDS AND THE WEIGHT REMAINS INTO YOUR BACK LEG YOUR RIGHT LEG FOR RIGHT HANDED PLAYERS
h2VKacwXr_w_5 0 THIS IMPACT BAG IS REALLY GOING TO TEACH YOU THE HABIT OF COMING TO THE CORRECT IMPACT POSITION AND IF YOU NOTICE HERE MY WEIGHT IS WAILING TO MY LEFT SIDE THE CLUB FACE IS BEHIND MY HANDS SO MY HANDS ARE HEAD AND IN THIS POSITION I AM ABLE TO HIT DOWN ON THE BALL
gnL24bqNJqE_7 0 SO SOMETIMES IF YOU HOLD ANYTHING SOMETIMES A BOWLING BALL THE BALL THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE
GbEUiOmdFMQ_15 0 GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT AROUND THE BLOCK TO VERIFY YOUR BALL JOINT REPLACEMENT
_GtKZbzWBig_9 0 SO THINK ABOUT TUCKING THAT RIBCAGE DOWN SQUEEZING UP WITH THE GLUTES AND THE HAMSTRINGS FINDING YOURSELF STABLE ON THE BALL EXTENDING THE ARMS OVER
_GtKZbzWBig_2 0 SO HOLD ON TO THE BALL AS YOU SLOWLY WALK YOURSELF OUT
_GtKZbzWBig_3 0 AGAIN IN THIS POSITION YOU WANT TO LET GET YOUR HEAD RESTING ON THE BALL AND NOT LET YOUR HIPS SAG SO YOU'RE GOING TO USE THE GLUTES TO CONTRACT TO LIFT THE HIPS AND HAVE YOUR HEAD IN LINE WITH YOUR SPINE
go2LNo0eSlQ_20 0 AND WORK ON GETTING THE BALL OUT OF THE GLOVE QUICK FOUR SEAM GRIP
G_yLd9y2nLk_14 0 THAT IS GOING TO HELP YOU STRONGLY RECOVER BACK AND ALSO BE ABLE TO HELP YOU ATTACK THE BALL
G_yLd9y2nLk_13 0 SEE HOW WIDE HIS FEET ARE AFTER HE HITS THE BALL AND THEN HE COMES BACK AROUND THERE

GYZLMMECK5k_3 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE PROPER METHOD FOR BREAKING THE MECHANICAL WELD BETWEEN YOUR BALL JOINT AND YOUR SPINDLE
GYZLMMECK5k_2 0 IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CORRECT PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZE VEHICLE
g7U59bTbBVs_7 0 THERE IS NO OTHER SPEED BALL COURSE OR MOGUL'S COURSE LIKE IT THAT WE CAN FIND ANYWHERE AND ONCE IT IS FINISHED IT WILL BE PROBABLY THE HARDEST COURSE IN CENTRAL TEXAS TO PLAY
GuBHuLTwVwE_4 0 JUST USE A BALL THAT YOU HAVE AT HOME GO TO YOUR KIDS ROOM GO TO THE TOY BOX AND CHOOSE AN EASY BALL AND YOU WOULD LIKE TO LINE THE GUEST OF THE PARTY IN A CIRCLE
GYZLMMECK5k_16 0 THAT IS THE PROPER WAY TO SEAT YOUR PICKLE FORK AND BREAK THE MECHANICAL WELD BETWEEN THE SPINDLE AND THE BALL JOINT
GYZLMMECK5k_15 0 RIGHT THERE THE MECHANICAL WELD HAS BEEN BROKEN AS YOU CAN SEE OUR UPPER BALL JOINT IS NOW FREE AND WE'RE READY TO CONTINUE WITH THE REST OF THE DISASSEMBLING PROCEDURE
gImBKT9w0Mk_4 0 A LOT OF TIMES THAT COMES FROM A GUY EITHER NOT LISTENING TO THE CADENCE HE'S NOT WATCHING THE BALL OR HE'S TOO FAR FROM THE BALL AND MAKES A MISTAKE BY JUMPING OFF SIDES PREMATURELY
gImBKT9w0Mk_5 0 THERE CAN BE AN OFF SIDES PENALTY AGAINST THE CENTER FOR MOVING OR MANIPULATING THE BALL TO THROW OFF THE DEFENSE
gImBKT9w0Mk_6 0 WHEN HE GOES DOWN ON THE BALL HE HAS TO GET SET
gImBKT9w0Mk_7 0 THE BALL WILL BE LAYING ON THE GROUND AND MAY BE TURNED TO THE SIDE
gImBKT9w0Mk_2 0 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN OUR CENTER GOES DOWN TO SNAP THE BALL THAT WE DON'T GET ANY PENALTIES
gImBKT9w0Mk_8 0 HE'S ALLOWED TO GRAB THE BALL TO GET IT SET BUT ONCE HE GETS THAT BALL SET HE CAN'T MOVE IT
gbvMqFhBqSU_5 0 THEY ARE NOT ASYMMETRICAL AS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT HERE NEXT TO THE BALL JOINT GREASE BOOT THERE IS AN L
hJ4FF57vwH8_4 0 IT'S NOT JUST BATTING A BALL BACK AND FORTH
gjinS7HdM2Q_8 0 AND NOW I AM THE PROPER DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE BALL
gHik_54lD7s_15 0 YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO GO LIFTING YOUR HEELS UP LIKE THIS BUT YOU WANT TO FEEL THE PRESSURE OKAY ON THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT
gitlNe_51ho_11 0 SO GETTING THE GRIP RIGHT WILL ALLOW YOU TO HIT A BALL NICELY BUT A POOR GRIP WILL GIVE YOU ALL TYPES OF COMPENSATIONS BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT IS
gsit1xgHHWE_9 0 AFTER THAT WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE GAMES WE ARE GOING TO PLAY LIKE EIGHT BALL NINE BALL ROTATION CUT THROAT AND CARNEY BALL AND FINALLY I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME FUN TRICK SHOTS THAT YOU CAN PLAY ON YOUR FRIENDS TO SHOW THEM THAT YOU HAVE MORE SKILL THAN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE
gsit1xgHHWE_4 0 FOR EXAMPLE HOW TO PICK OUT A CUE HOW TO HOLD THE CUE HOW TO MAKE A BRIDGE SO THE CUE CAN HIT THE CUE BALL HOW TO HIT THE CUE BALL DIFFERENT ENGLISH FOR THE CUE BALL
gsit1xgHHWE_7 0 THERE'S A STRAIGHT END SHOT THERE'S THE BANK SHOT THERE'S THE KICK SHOT THERE'S THE COMBINATION SHOT THERE'S A SHOT OFF ONE BALL THERE'S A SNOOKER SHOT THERE'S A SAFETY SHOT AND THEN THERE'S A SCRATCH SHOT
GVWXveM_fzE_2 0 JUST LIKE THE THREE BALL MULTIPLEX START IT'S A COOL WAY TO START
GVWXveM_fzE_1 0 THE FOUR BALL SIDE BY SIDE MULTIPLEX START
GyadXiKJfLU_4 0 I JUST PINCHED A SMALL AMOUNT OF CLAY OFF OF MY CLAY AND ROLLED IT INTO A BALL AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE TO MAKE THE KNOB
GIe5C5GIxf0_12 0 PEOPLE USE IT A LOT FOR DIFFERENT THREE BALL PATTERNS
GrnggJJBZ4Y_14 0 ROLL UP THAT BALL AGAIN
gcj62_Y5fHA_10 0 AND ON A FAST CLOTH LIKE THIS IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE HIT RIGHT IN THE CENTER AND SLIDE ALL THE WAY OVER TO THAT BALL AND STOP
HK7a25sxpbw_11 0 SO I'LL FILL UP ONE CUP WORTH OF WATER IN MY MUG AND THEN SUBMERGE THE DIFFUSING BALL INSIDE THE CUP
HK7a25sxpbw_13 0 SO SINCE IT'S GREEN TEA WE'RE GOING TO LET IT SIT FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES AND WHEN WE'RE FINISHED PULL OUT THE BALL GIVE IT A FEW SECONDS TO DRAIN
hbtksI9ewLk_21 0 SO MY OBJECTIVE NOW IS TO COME OVER HERE WITH THE ANGLE THAT I NEED TO THEN KICK THE BALL INTO THIS POCKET
GPYYGaoy0IM_3 0 SO LET'S SAY THE BALL IS UP LIKE ON THIS
GJNxi_ipEio_14 0 NOW WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE TWIST JUST LIKE YOU HAVE AN AX AND YOU'RE CHOPPING WOOD YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE SAME THING WITH THE BALL AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME ACROSS THE BODY
GJrc-igSJX4_10 0 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET A GOOD FEEL FOR THE BALL SO YOU TIP THE BALL BACK AND FORTH RAISE IT UP HIGHER AND HIGHER
GJrc-igSJX4_15 0 NEXT DRILL WILL BE FOR BALL HANDLING ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF BALL HANDLING IS DRIBBLING
GmBAme-Ik_c_13 0 HE GETS LOW AND HE HITS THE BALL HIGH OFF THE FRONT WALL
GmBAme-Ik_c_10 0 SO SEE HOW HE GETS UNDERNEATH THE BALL
gqcqN86jHhQ_13 0 THE TOSS IS THE HARDEST AND THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE SERVE AND BASICALLY WHAT YOU DO ON THE TOSS YOU ARE THROWING THE BALL RIGHT WHERE YOU NEED IT TO BE IN ORDER TO HIT THE SHOT
gvrq6Nw-8S8_16 0 NEXT IS THE CAPTIVE BEAD AND THE CAPTIVE BEAD IS A SMALL HOOP WITH THE BALL SUSPENDED SIX DAYS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND THE BALL POPS RIGHT OUT AND SHOULD POP RIGHT BACK IN LIKE THIS
gvrq6Nw-8S8_13 0 THIS IS JUST A FLAT BACK STUD WITH A BALL THAT SCREWS ON AND OFF
