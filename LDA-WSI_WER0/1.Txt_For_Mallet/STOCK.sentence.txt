GgHxdyX3sqI_15 0 THE THING ABOUT CHICKEN STOCK IS A VERY NEUTRAL STOCK SO IT WILL ALWAYS TAKE ON WHATEVER FLAVOR YOU END UP ADDING AND ONCE WE PUT THE FISH IN THAT CHICKEN FLAVOR WILL REALLY GO AWAY
GgHxdyX3sqI_14 0 IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE USING CLAM JUICE OR YOU DON'T HAVE IT OR IN FACT YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO SHELL FISH THE THING I WOULD USE IS CHICKEN STOCK
GgHxdyX3sqI_17 0 I TEND TO USE A LOW CHICKEN STOCK BUT THAT IS BECAUSE I WANT TO ADD THE SALT IN TERMS OF HOW THE SEASONING WORKS
GgHxdyX3sqI_16 0 OBVIOUSLY IF YOU CLAM AND YOU HAVE FISH YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE MORE OCEAN SWEET FLAVOR BUT THE CHICKEN STOCK REALLY IS QUITE ACCEPTABLE AS WELL
