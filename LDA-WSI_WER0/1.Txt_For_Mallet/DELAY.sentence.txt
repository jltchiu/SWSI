hJCk5ucuT60_5 0 URSULA SIT DOWN SIT STAND YES GOOD GIRL A LITTLE BIT OF A DELAY THERE
Gfna7SQbvq8_17 0 THERE'S ALMOST A LITTLE BIT OF A DELAY FOR IT
hi92yBCeRyM_5 0 SO TO DO THE SET FOR THE FOR THE NAIL DELAY YOU WANT TO PUT SOME SPIN ON IT AND KEEP THAT NAIL RIGHT IN THE CENTER FOLLOWING THE CENTER AT ALL TIMES
hi92yBCeRyM_3 0 SO WHAT ALSO WITH A NAIL DELAY YOU NEED TO PUT A LOT OF SPIN ON YOUR FRISBEE
hi92yBCeRyM_4 0 IF YOU DON'T PUT A LOT OF SPIN ON YOUR FRISBEE IT'S GOING TO BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO DO A NAIL DELAY AND YOU WANT YOUR FRISBEE TO COME DOWN NICE AND FLAT
gjgIM_u-bJU_10 0 SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I TOOK THIS DELAY PEDAL AND PUT IT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAIN I WOULD BE DISTORTING THE SOUND OF THE DELAY RATHER THAN IF I PUT IT AT THE END
gjgIM_u-bJU_11 0 THE DELAY WOULD BE DELAYING THE SOUND OF EVERYTHING THAT CAME BEFORE IT
hi92yBCeRyM_7 0 AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY BALANCE IT THERE WITHOUT IT SPINNING BUT IF YOU COULD PUT SOME SPIN ON IT AND HAVE THAT CLAW DELAY AND THEN YOU CAN GO TO TWO FINGERS AND THEN ONE FINGER AND YOU'LL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GET CONTROL WHICH WILL OPEN UP THE DOOR TO MANY MANY MANY MORE TRICKS
hi92yBCeRyM_1 0 HI IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO TALK ABOUT A NAIL DELAY AND WHAT A NAIL DELAY IS IS WHEN YOU'RE SPINNING THE FRISBEE ON YOUR NAIL
hiGh_Qx1cP8_13 0 AND THEY'RE NAMED REVERB I AND DELAY I
GvSYu_j-am0_10 0 YOU WANT TO DELAY A LITTLE BIT ONCE AGAIN
