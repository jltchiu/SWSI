gC60UjILVDU_3 0 BUT YOU CAN POINT IT IN TOO AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT ILLUMINATES THE BACKGROUND A LITTLE BIT MORE
G5OJcRrohBw_20 0 SO YOU WANT TO TRY FIND YOUR HIP BONES POINT BOTH YOUR HEADLIGHTS FORWARD
hCOC5kOCkPk_6 0 AND THEN WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS CUT EACH STEM SO YOU HAVE A LITTLE POINT ON IT AGAIN AND JUST SLIP IT IN BETWEEN THE TULIPS LIKE THAT
gxpibbDL9gY_8 0 THE MAIN POINT IS THAT YOU GET THE IDEA ACROSS TO THE EDITOR THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE AN AWESOME BOOK THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WANT TO READ
GuKM0lT5C4Q_4 0 AT THIS POINT AT MY CONSULTATION I WENT AHEAD AND TALKED WITH MY CLIENT AND I'M GOING TO END UP USING A FIRM GEL
-hcB_DwTLDQ_6 0 AGAIN PUT IN THAT POINT AND JUST CHOP STRAIGHT DOWN
GxvUBMfT25M_15 0 LOU I GET SWEATY AND I GET NERVOUS AND I GET SCARED AND BASICALLY IT'S VERY DRAWING TO THE POINT OF NOT KNOWING THE UNKNOWN KIND OF THING THAT SCARES ME AND I JUMP
GxvUBMfT25M_19 0 AND THIS IS JUST TO POINT OUT THAT IT IS THE EMOTION THAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING IN THE DREAM WHICH IS MOST SIGNIFICANT
hCvNibEfOOM_4 0 OUR POINT GUARDS ARE TYPICALLY ONE OF THE SMALLER GUYS IN THE OFFENSE AND OUR SHOOTING GUARDS ARE USUALLY A LITTLE BIT BIGGER
GmTdLtPJb9U_7 0 YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS BY CLIMBING TO A HIGHER POINT
GAbc4MyyZyo_12 0 NOW AT THIS POINT IF I WERE JUST GOING TO RUN BACK ON THE FIELD THIS BARREL IS GOOD TO GO AND THAT'S ALL YOU'D NEED TO DO
H4pCrLzPN0A_5 0 BUT CERTAINLY THE USE OF THE HANDS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL IN ORDER TO EMPHASIZE AND ALSO SOMETIMES IN ORDER TO POINT YOURSELF IN TO A CERTAIN DIRECTION IN THE SPEECH
HiPCZZl51Ww_14 0 I'VE GOT MY HIGH POINT OUT THERE
HiPCZZl51Ww_15 0 I HAVE A SENSE OF HOW FAST IT WOULD BE FROM HALFWAY AND THEN I TRY TO PUTT IT TO THAT HALFWAY POINT WITH THE RIGHT SPEED
HiPCZZl51Ww_10 0 SO I'M TRYING TO PICK A HIGH POINT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE BALL AND THE HOLE
HiPCZZl51Ww_11 0 I'LL GO UP TO THAT HIGH POINT AND I'LL MAKE A COUPLE OF PRACTICE STROKES LOOKING AT THE HOLE
-H5UG2i7nbQ_5 0 NOW I NEED TO FIND THE HALFWAY POINT HOLD ONE STILL AND TWIST THE OTHER BUBBLE ON THE OTHER SIDE
-H5UG2i7nbQ_8 0 NOW WE NEED TO FIND THE HALFWAY POINT OF OUR OVAL SHAPE
HeiOS5o4TKM_12 0 AS YOU START TO STUDY OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK AND LEARN THE TECHNIQUES THEY USED YOU'LL GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE READY TO START COMING UP WITH YOUR OWN TECHNIQUES AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T LOOK AT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE THEN YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO BE RESTRICTED TO YOUR INITIAL IDEAS
hFiINQH0R1g_10 0 AND THEN WE START BREAKING THE SILICA OFF WHICH IS VERY BRITTLE AT THIS POINT WITH SLEDGE HAMMERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT TO EXPOSE THE BRONZE
Gx6CxnX79jg_7 0 YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH THIS HALF BALL AND TAKE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PART OF IT AND POINT IT UPWARDS
GuYZuooiVUM_9 0 DO A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE POINT A LOT OF DARK CIRCLES CAN BE CAUSED FROM EITHER SINUS CONGESTION OR JUST BECAUSE THE SKIN IS SO THIN THERE A LOT OF BLOOD LAYING VERY CLOSE TO THE SURFACE
gaIcDhiuiu0_16 0 YOU GUYS CANNOT STAND UP IF YOU STAND UP IN THE RIVER YOU CAN AND YOU PROBABLY WILL AT SOME POINT GET A FOOT ENTRAPMENT
gaIcDhiuiu0_10 0 IF YOU FALL OUT OF THE RAFT TODAY A FEW THINGS YOU NEED TO REMEMBER YOU LAY ON YOUR BACK YOU POINT YOUR FEET DOWNSTREAM WHICH IS THE DIRECTION THE RIVER IS GOING AND YOU LOOK FOR HELP
HE3V48KjQKg_11 0 THIS ONE OBVIOUSLY I'M PROBABLY NOT GOING TO REPRODUCE UPSIDE DOWN AS WELL BUT YOU GET THE POINT
GL0jG3gy4rk_2 0 THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF STRAIGHTENERS THAT YOU CAN DO AT THIS POINT
hAUeqalPhWI_3 0 NOW LET ME POINT OUT WITH THESE THESE ARE SILK SHEERS
Gkfv78919ek_34 0 ALL RIGHT LET'S DO THREE POINT LIGHTING AGAIN GUYS
GUQo3MA2MyE_23 0 AND IT'S ACTUALLY AFTER THAT POINT WHERE WE'LL ADD IN THE DETAILS ADDITIONAL DETAILS LIKE ON THE COSTUME AND THE LIKE
HF2toZzD37U_3 0 INSTEAD OF JUST GOING AND DROPPING DOWN WITH A MELT YOU WOULD WANT TO JUST LET EVERYTHING GO REALLY SLOWLY AND CONTROL YOUR BODY AND GET TO THAT POINT REALLY SLOWLY
G5I3Jru9zAw_29 0 NOT TO THE POINT WHERE HE WOULD BE A RUNAWAY OR A PROBLEM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT IT JUST DOESN'T GET ME QUITE AS SNAPPY OF A TURN AS I WOULD LIKE AND SO THIS IS A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT CALLED AN OVER THE POLL TIE DOWN
HfNZDZc4eCI_4 0 AFTER THE BATTER HAS COOLED OFF WE WILL TAKE IT AND SLOWLY POUR IT INSIDE THE BATTER SO THAT IT'LL ALL MIX REAL GOOD TO A POINT THAT IT COMES OUT REAL NICE AND SMOOTH
g_sUCNtQYGE_1 0 THE NEXT POINT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS STOMACH 36 OR THREE MILE RUN
gw4Kxu8tyjU_8 0 THE NEXT TOOL DOWN IS THE DELETE ANCHOR POINT TOOL AGAIN WE JUST WANT TO DELETE IT AND AWAY IT GOES
gw4Kxu8tyjU_9 0 AND OUR FINAL TOOL IN THE PEN DRAWER IS THE CONVERT ANCHOR POINT TOOL
gw4Kxu8tyjU_6 0 SO WE'VE GOT THE PEN TOOL UNDERNEATH THE PEN TOOL WE'VE GOT THE ADD ANCHOR POINT TOOL WHICH IS PRETTY SELF EXPLANATORY
gw4Kxu8tyjU_7 0 IF WE DECIDE WE WANT IT AHEAD AT THE POINT SIMPLY CLICK RIGHT THERE AND IF WE GET OUR SUB-SELECTION TOOL AND DRAG THAT OUT
guv2h74Gpyk_12 0 AT THAT POINT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO REACH INSIDE THAT TIRE AND REMOVE THE FLAT INNER TUBE
g9dv4TRFIxI_6 0 AND IT TO THE POINT WHERE IT SHOULD ALMOST LOOK FAKE
h3NueTMOkoI_7 0 BASICALLY THE POINT OF THIS IS TO HEAT THE WATER TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_8 0 NOW WE CAN HOLD THIS WITH ONE POINT
gdENWgq54iI_11 0 NOW WHEN YOU'RE STRETCHING YOU WANT TO HOLD YOUR STRETCH TO THE POINT OF MILD DISCOMFORT
H2OE97e7fw8_7 0 SO ZONING OUT IS ACTUALLY IF YOU CAN PRACTICE IT TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN DO THAT ON CUE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS AND HAVE SOMETHING JUST FLOW FROM THE HEART IT'S AMAZING THE WONDERFUL THINGS THAT CAN COME OUT OF ZONING OUT
gx6YmcpPRXw_8 0 NOW THE POINT IS TO GET ALL THE CARDS UP AT THE TOP BUT IN ORDER TO GET THEM AT THE TOP YOU NEED TO HAVE AN ACE
giOX89zrQMc_20 0 AND SO THEN FAITH CAN JUST LOWER RIGHT TO THAT POINT AND THEN BRING HER WEIGHT FORWARD AND COME RIGHT UP INTO YOUR UP DOG
hbYDX7_1YVA_24 0 THIS IS WHERE I USUALLY GET MYSELF IN TROUBLE BECAUSE I TRY TO MAKE IT TOO THIN BUT WE'RE NO WHERE NEAR THAT POINT RIGHT NOW
gh0vsBwlJcQ_14 0 MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE HELPFUL BUT NOT TO THE POINT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL OR BECOMING OVERBEARING BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT OCD IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL LOSES EVERY SENSE OF CONTROL THAT THEY HAVE OR THEY HAD VERY LITTLE CONTROL
gj3v4r6Lb-U_9 0 AT THAT POINT WHAT YOU WILL DO IS YOU WILL TAKE THE SLIDE AND PULL THE SLIDE BACK
H0jzFiEhqsE_11 0 SO YOU SEE THAT WE JUST DREW IN A VOLUME CHANGE AND AS THE SONG PLAYS ONCE IT GETS TO THAT POINT IT'S GOING TO START FADING DOWN AND THEN ONCE IT GOES BACK TO THE NEXT LOOP IT GOES RIGHT BACK UP TO ZERO
H9uP61mLe6k_3 0 YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH PUBLISH ONE ONLINE AT THIS POINT FOR NEXT TO NOTHING AND PEOPLE CAN ORDER IT YOU ACTUALLY CAN DO THAT I THINK ON MACINTOSH
g6Nk9SdgLWc_15 0 THE FORWARD ACTUALLY SMALL FORWARD WILL HAVE THIS RESPONSIBILITY OUT HERE ANYTHING BEYOND THAT POINT GUARDS REACH IS ON THIS SIDE OF THE COURT WILL BE THAT SMALL FORWARDS RESPONSIBILITY
g6Nk9SdgLWc_16 0 ON THE OTHER SIDE SAME THING WITH THE SHOOTING GUARD ANYTHING OVER THERE PAST THE POINT GUARD WILL BE THAT SHOOTING GUARDS RESPONSIBILITY
g6Nk9SdgLWc_11 0 SO YOU'LL HAVE THE POINT GUARD UP TOP YOU'LL HAVE A FORWARD RIGHT HERE A CENTER WILL BE A LITTLE FURTHER BACK BUT WHAT YOU'LL HAVE IS YOU'LL HAVE A SMALL FORWARD HERE YOU'LL HAVE THE SHOOTING GUARD ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SUPPORT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEFENSE
-GCHRcGT-44_15 0 THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL IS A POINT TO POINT
hegdgLllYu8_2 0 SO RIGHT NOW I'M AT THE HALF POINT OF AND READY TO GO AHEAD AND DESIGN MY CENTERPIECE
gkOb1rU8dLs_29 0 NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS KIND OF OPEN THIS SECTION UP HERE KIND OF GIVE IT A LITTLE ROOM AND THEN HOLD RIGHT HERE AT THE POINT OF THE NECK
gkOb1rU8dLs_20 0 WE'RE GOING TO BASICALLY JUST KIND OF SQUASH FOLD THIS BY GRABBING THIS POINT PULLING IT DOWN TO WHERE IT IS IN LINE WITH OUR WING SECTION HERE
gkOb1rU8dLs_27 0 SAME THING HERE OFF THIS BACK POINT AND KIND OF KEEPING IT EVEN WITH THAT WING RIGHT THERE
gkOb1rU8dLs_26 0 NOW OPEN THE WINGS LIKE THIS AND THEN FOLD THEM DOWN PULLING OFF THIS POINT HERE WE'RE GOING TO FOLD IT DOWN IN TO A FORWARD FOLD
GhhzAPFwzas_34 0 SO AT THIS POINT AS LONG AS I BREAK IT AWAY FROM THE STEM
g50rCJZrX0k_15 0 WHEN I STARTED I HAD TO USE A HAIR DRYER WHICH WAS OKAY BUT IT'S A LOT OF AIR AND NOT ENOUGH HEAT AND THEN THERE'S A THING CALLED AN EMBOSSING GUN THAT SCRAPBOOKERS USE AND AGAIN THAT'S TOO MUCH HEAT AND NOT ENOUGH AIR YOU CAN WORK TWO TOGETHER BUT THAT GETS TO BE A LITTLE CUMBERSOME SO AT SOME POINT YOU MIGHT INVEST IN A HEAVIER DUTY TOOL LIKE THIS
GoV9Ng9VBIM_11 0 AND INSTEAD OF THROWING IT AWAY I TOOK SOME OF THESE LITTLE PIECES OF COPPER SLIPPED IT INTO THE LITTLE BENT PIECE OF THE PEN POINT AND MADE A LITTLE FOOT THAT I COULD ALSO USE WITH THE WAX
GoV9Ng9VBIM_10 0 NOW A HANDY LITTLE THING IS THIS THAT I THINK I SAID BEFORE THAT THIS LITTLE PEN POINT IF YOU DROP IT YOU'LL MESS UP THE POINT AND IT'LL BEND LIKE THIS ONE HAPPENS TO BE BENT
GmzjTbzZC30_6 0 ALSO ANOTHER QUICK POINT TO MENTION IN THE FOUR X 100 IS THAT YOU HAVE TO GET THE BATON SAFELY AROUND THE TRACK WHICH IS A 400-METER LAP AND SOMETIMES THE LACK OF SPEED COMPENSATE FOR BASIC BATON EXCHANGES
_hh0ibfvvuU_8 0 I'D SAY I'M ABOUT TWO-THIRDS TO MAYBE NOT QUITE TWO-THIRDS HALFWAY UP ON MY CONTAINER SO IN MY FIRST LASAGNA LAYER I'M GOING TO PUT THE LARGER BULBS IN BECAUSE THE POINT IS THE LARGER BULBS WILL WORK UP THROUGH THE SMALLER BULBS
hbtksI9ewLk_26 0 AND DAY-TO-DAY I WANT MY AVERAGE TO COME DOWN TO THE VERY LOWEST POINT
GanQ2mq1LwE_4 0 OKAY AT THIS POINT IT IS GOOD TO DO A LOT OF FLUFFING LIKE THIS TO DROP TO STRAIGHTEN OUT SOME OF THE MATERIAL
gZJmZ5Dxljw_10 0 EACH ROUND YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY TO A POINT TOTAL OF TWO-HUNDRED FIFTY
GuPfrbCfXvk_11 0 SO NOW WHEN I PLAY IT SHOULD BE ON POINT
GOauGH8_zXE_19 0 WHILE WE'RE HERE I ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO HIT YOUR SEAT BELTS
