GRvDiV_lFsU_10 0 THE KING SHOULD FIT TWO SQUARES WHEN YOU LAY HIM DOWN OR A ROOK ONE SQUARE WHEN YOU LAY HIM DOWN
HFbz10GyFs4_20 0 WOULD YOU BID THAT KING OF CLUBS
gs-L3zz_KDM_17 0 I MEAN CHANCES ARE THE OPPONENTS THE ONLY WAY THAT THIS BID WOULD BE SET WITH THIS ACE IS THAT ONE OPPONENT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE KING QUEEN JACK TEN OR SOMETHING OF THAT ILK
gEMxnLl9bf0_3 0 THAT'S THE ONLY REQUIREMENT FOR YOUR MATTRESS THAT IT HAS A CENTER SUPPORT ON A QUEEN AND A KING SIZE MATTRESS
gVxZfWqrog0_9 0 AS OPPOSED TO A STAUNTON KING
gVxZfWqrog0_8 0 BUT THE THING ABOUT A LOT OF THESE UNIQUE CHESS SETS IS THAT THEY HAVE UNUSUAL PIECES SUCH AS THIS IS THE KING
HJnVnbbzTjw_3 0 SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO NOW IS CATCH THE ACE OF DIAMONDS CATCH THE KING OF SPADES PLAY THE THREE OF HEARTS AND SAY THAT'S IT
GRvDiV_lFsU_39 0 BUT IN GENERAL YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A STAUNTON THAT'S THREE SEVEN FIVE FOUR INCHES TALL FOR THE KING
gs-L3zz_KDM_23 0 THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TWO SMALLER SPADES WITH IT IS VERY ENCOURAGING BECAUSE EITHER YOUR PARTNER COULD HAVE THE JACK QUEEN KING OR ACE OF SPADES WHICH IS ABOUT EIGHTY-FIVE PERCENT PROBABILITY
HFbz10GyFs4_22 0 IF THE ACE OF CLUBS IS OVER HERE THEN THE KING IS GOING TO GET SWALLOWED UP
gVxZfWqrog0_24 0 STAUNTON HERE IS THE SET THAT YOU'RE USED TO WAS A STYLIZED FORM AND ACROSS FROM THE TOP FROM THE KING
HFbz10GyFs4_23 0 IF THE ACE OF CLUBS IS IN YOU PARTNER'S HAND THIS IS THE KEY CARD HERE THEN YOUR KING WILL WALK THROUGH
HFbz10GyFs4_25 0 TOO BECAUSE IF THE LEAD COMES THROUGH HERE YOU'LL GET YOUR KING IN
H6edKSuE79c_8 0 ANYTIME YOU HAVE COLUMNS OUT THERE AND THEY'RE THE ONLY COLUMNS REMAINING AND THE VALUE OF ALL THE COLUMNS IN THIS CASE TWO IS THE SAME IN THIS CASE KING
GS9T1hVI0co_12 0 IN THIS BETTING ROUND THE PLAYER WITH THE KING WOULD START THE BETTING ROUND
GS9T1hVI0co_14 0 AGAIN THE PLAYER STARTS THE BETTING WITH THE HIGHEST CARD SHOWING THIS BEING THE KING
HDf07ZoVpoQ_4 0 MY NAME IS DANIEL KING
H6edKSuE79c_11 0 BECAUSE A KING PLAYS ON AN ACE BUT THE ACES ARE LOCKED UP BEHIND THE KINGS
HFbz10GyFs4_11 0 ACE KING OF HEARTS LOOK GOOD FOR TWO TRICKS ACE KING OF CLUBS FOR TWO TRICKS AND THE ACE OF SPADES IS DEFINITELY ONE TRICK
hgGySE80h88_7 0 YOU CAN SEE SHE ACTUALLY REPRODUCED THIS FIRE KING AND BECAME VERY POPULAR SO IT RAISES THE PRICE ON THESE ITEMS WHEN THEY BECOME MORE IN DEMAND
hgGySE80h88_6 0 SO ANOTHER THING THAT COMES TO MIND IS FIRE KING WHICH IS THE GREEN DINNERWARE PRODUCED IN THE 1900'S THAT MARTHA STEWART SHOWS ALL THE TIME
h7ffVNNtEsA_4 0 WELL AN EIGHT- LOW CAN WIN SO I SAY KEEP THE EIGHT AND THROW AWAY THE KING SO YOU'RE GOING TO ASK FOR ONE CARD SO WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE
hCmdD1BYZDg_22 0 AND YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME TO GIVE YOUR KING WHATEVER KIND OF SHOES YOU FEEL HE SHOULD BE WEARING
hCmdD1BYZDg_23 0 BUT IN MY WORLD THIS KING HE LOOKS YOU KNOW LIKE THE KIND OF KING THAT WOULD BE WEARING SHOES LIKE THAT
hCmdD1BYZDg_20 0 AND TO ME IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THIS KING IS THE TYPE OF KING THAT WOULD LIKE TO WEAR REALLY JUST SILLY SHOES WITH REALLY RIDICULOUS LITTLE FLAPS LIKE THIS
GRvDiV_lFsU_25 0 THIS HERE IS THE FOUR INCH EBONY SET THE KING FROM THAT SET
HDf07ZoVpoQ_20 0 MY NAME IS DANIEL KING
H6edKSuE79c_7 0 WE'RE BUSTED BECAUSE WE'RE DOWN TO A KING AND A KING
hCmdD1BYZDg_19 0 BUT I I THIS KING I DON'T KNOW FOR WHATEVER REASON WHEN YOU'RE DRAWING A YOU KNOW CHARACTER ANY CHARACTER YOU SORT OF HAVE TO BE TRUE TO THE CHARACTER THAT YOU START WITH
hCmdD1BYZDg_18 0 NOW I'LL ADMIT THIS IS SORT OF A UNIQUE LOOK FOR A KING I MEAN IF WE WANTED TO WE COULD OF GIVEN HIM BOOTS OR WE COULD OF GIVEN HIM YOU KNOW ANYTHING REALLY
GRvDiV_lFsU_9 0 THE HEIGHT OF THE SET IS JUDGED BY HOW TALL THE KING IS
GRvDiV_lFsU_5 0 SETS ARE USUALLY WOOD AND STAUNTON IN STYLE WHICH IS THE CLASSIC STYLE HERE WITH A STYLIZED BODY AND A CROSS ON THE TOP FOR THE KING
g_p-YsZuuvQ_26 0 MY NAME IS DANIEL KING
gT5Su9TcfGI_27 0 BIG JOKER LITTLE JOKER ACE KING QUEEN AND SO FORTH
hCmdD1BYZDg_4 0 IT IS VERY LIKELY THIS KING WOULD HAVE QUITE NICE SHOES I'M SURE SO WE'LL DRAW HIS ANKLES COMING DOWN LIKE SO
hCmdD1BYZDg_2 0 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO BE DRAWING SOME FEET ON OUR KING AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT THIS GAP IS HERE WE'RE EVENTUALLY GOING TO BE DRAWING HIS QUEEN STANDING NEXT TO HIM BUT FOR NOW HE'S BY HIMSELF
