G6IX6wDgTto_1 0 I'M GOING TO GIVE CARRIE HERE A NICE HEAD MASSAGE WITH THE SHAMPOO
h4duFFZNKjQ_12 0 SO SHE'S ONE LONG LINE OF ENERGY FROM THE CROWN OF HER HEAD ALL THE WAY DOWN TO HER TOES
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_15 0 BECAUSE THE SQUARE BOLT HEAD IS NOT SUPPOSED TO ROTATE
hbYDX7_1YVA_21 0 AND THAT COULD BE MADE INTO AN ARROW HEAD
GaEz7YxBy0Y_6 0 WE WOULD TAKE THE REINS OVER HER HEAD AND WE ARE GOING TO COME AROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE AND RUN THE RIGHT STIRRUP UP
HFA_4HkuXqc_4 0 IT'S ALSO AN OPTION TO HAVE A STALL GUARD SO THAT YOUR HORSE IS ABLE TO STICK IT'S HEAD OUT AND THE VENTILATION IS IMPROVED
gUqgX-M-MDE_7 0 WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS YOU DON'T WANT TO BRING THE SHOTGUN HERE AND THEN BRING YOUR HEAD DOWN LIKE SO
gAng2oz-gSY_14 0 WE'RE HERE EYES REVERSE YOKOMEN TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEAD
GAbv8rT1ggI_6 0 YOU'LL NEED SOME FELT OR SOME FUN FOAM TO CUT FOR THE HEAD AND FOR THE TAIL AND THE WINGS
GJAGGMJR-b4_11 0 EVERYTHING FROM ONE BLADE TO FOUR BLADES ON A SINGLE HEAD
H4vmXW8WQj4_3 0 SO COME ON DOWN AND YOU WANT TO JUST REST YOUR HEAD GENTLY ON YOUR ARM
G5OsWl7JwAo_15 0 IF IN THE TWIST AND A HEAD FIRST ENTRY YOU TWIST MORE THAN WHAT THEY CONSIDER NINETY DEGREES IF I'M DOING A HEAD FIRST ENTRY AND I SHOULD BE LANDING THIS WAY BUT I HAPPEN TO TWIST MY BODY MORE THAN NINETY DEGREES OK THEN THEY'RE GOING TO CONSIDER THAT A FAIL DIVE
hiZ6DKSaizA_6 0 THE SPINES STAYS IN NEUTRAL WHICH MEANS THE HEAD HAS TO STAY LIFTED
gnbCyxmKPZw_11 0 IF YOU LOSE YOUR BALANCE DURING ONE OF THESE CLIPS SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING TO YOURSELF IN YOUR HEAD
gkOb1rU8dLs_24 0 NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO FORM THE HEAD BY JUST OPENING THIS UP AND RABBIT EAR FOLDING THIS LIKE SO
hJ6_VGOITXo_10 0 NOW FOR THE TOP OF THE HEAD WE ARE GOING TO FOLD IT DOWN SO THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THE HEAD OF THE HORSE
GrnggJJBZ4Y_16 0 SO WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT DOWN INTO THE HEAD INSTEAD OF THROUGH THE BACK OF THE EYE
HB01hhonf8Q_25 0 SO FROM HERE I'VE GOT HIM PINNED HERE AND IF HE STARTS TO GET AWAY I CAN TRANSITION INTO A STRIKE TO A HEAD GRAB TO A KNEE DROP ANYTHING THAT I NEED IS RIGHT HERE AT MY FEET
gWkdfyqD35U_3 0 BREATHING DRILLS FOR FREESTYLE ARE REALLY QUITE IMPORTANT TO HELP MAXIMIZE YOUR V02 CAPACITY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO KEEP THAT HEAD DOWN AND FOCUSED
gH8QCtHPeO4_8 0 THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD FRAMING FOR A HEAD SHOT AND THAT'S CERTAINLY ADEQUATE BUT IT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE INTERESTING IF WE CAN JUST SHIFT HER SHOULDERS A LITTLE BIT
gH8QCtHPeO4_4 0 WE WANT TO ALSO SHOW HER FACE AND NOT MUCH MORE THAN THAT BUT WITHIN THAT FRAME THE NEXT THING THAT WE'LL REALLY DEAL WITH IS POSING AND THE POSES FOR A HEAD SHOT FOR A HEAD SHOT FOR AN ACTING OR A MODELING PORTFOLIO
gH8QCtHPeO4_1 0 WE HAVE GOOD FRAMING OF CAITLIN IN OUR FRAME AND THAT'S ABOUT PERFECT FOR A HEAD SHOT
g7U59bTbBVs_8 0 MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO PLAY HERE GET HEAD SHOT BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A LOT OF COVER
gBEv-iksiNo_7 0 NOW IF YOU WANTED TO YOU COULD USE COLORED MATCH STICKS MATCHES RATHER WHERE THE HEAD OF THE MATCH IS A DIFFERENT COLOR AND YOU CAN ALTERNATE THOSE COLORS
HCKYA56xZo4_10 0 OKAY THE OTHER CONSIDERATION AND THIS IS WHERE MOST OF YOUR HEAT LOSS WILL COME FROM IS AROUND YOUR NECK AND FROM YOUR HEAD
HCKYA56xZo4_11 0 SO YOUR HEAD COVERING AND AROUND YOUR NECK BECOME VERY VERY CRITICAL TO MAINTAIN YOUR BODY HEAT IN SUB ZERO TEMPERATURES
gMLscPBaw2M_13 0 I LOWER MY SHOULDERS FIRST AND THEN I UNROLL MY HEAD
gEtTXn_UJQg_23 0 BECAUSE THE TOP SECTION IS JUST A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN THE TWO SECTIONS THAT WE HAD IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD I CAN JUST COMPLETELY DROP THIS SECTION DOWN AND COMB THE HAIR IN ITS NATURAL FALL
gEtTXn_UJQg_26 0 AGAIN I SEE WHERE MY GUIDE IS I SIMPLY LET THAT SLIP BETWEEN MY FINGERS AND THAT WOULD TOTALLY CUT THE BACK AND JUST TRIM IT WHERE WE HAVE A NICE HARD EDGE OR NICE HARD PERIMETER LINE BLUNT LINE FOR THE BACK OF THE HEAD
g7Re-BG7XnY_12 0 YOU CAN DO A HAMSTRING STRETCH FOR THE BACK OF YOUR LEGS LYING ON YOUR BACK AND BRINGING YOUR LEG OVER YOU HEAD
