GFfMVNhUO3E_25 0 BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT LARGER BIRDS OR CROWS TO GET IN THERE AND ATTACK THE BABIES
HiwtELMng_A_13 0 OR ONCE AGAIN MY POINT IS STILL ON LINE MY ARM IS COMPLETELY EXTENDED BUT IF SHE ATTEMPTS TO BIND OR BEAT AND I HAD MANAGED TO ACTUALLY AVOID HER BLADE THEN I COULD COME IN FOR AN ATTACK
gBT_ktNuc-4_12 0 I LIKE TO USE WAX ON CHROME BUMPERS ON WHEELS PARTICULARLY IN A HARSH ENVIRONMENT HERE LIKE WE'RE IN UTAH THERE'S A LOT OF SALT AND ROAD GRIME THAT HAS A TENDENCY TO ATTACK AND WORK ON THE CHROME SO IT ACTUALLY LEAVES A PROTECTIVE COAT AND FINISH ON THE CHROME
hivena9srJE_10 0 FOR INSTANCE IF IT IS THE FRONT HAND JAB IT WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE FOR ME TO MOVE THIS FOOT AND THEN STEP IN AND JAB BECAUSE AS SOON AS THIS FOOT MOVES HE SENSES THE ATTACK
hivena9srJE_15 0 PENETRATING FOOTWORK IS ALSO KNOWN AS THE INITIAL MOTION AND THE INITIAL MOVE ON ANY ATTACK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
g77gf-Uy_-s_23 0 SO AS I AM DOING THIS TECHNIQUE I AM PROTECTING AGAINST A POTENTIAL COUNTER ATTACK BY KEEPING MY ELBOW IN THE CENTER SO I AM HERE STRAIGHT THROUGH BACK LEG SIDE KICK
gMJe2MJJP7E_1 0 THIS IS KIND OF TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WEAPON IS COMING AT YOU WHETHER IT'S A KNIFE A JO LIKE THE FIVE FOOT STAFF OR A SWORD OR IF IT'S AN EMPTY HANDED ATTACK WHETHER IT'S A GRAB OR A STRIKE ANY TECHNIQUE THAT WE'VE GOT IN AIKIDO CAN BE APPLIED TO WHATEVER SITUATION
hjvqiK4Fbc4_1 0 THE MAJOR THING I KEEP COMING BACK TO OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN I AM TALKING ABOUT DISTRIBUTING THE WEIGHT IS SORT OF THINK ON THE ATTACK POSITION WHICH IS JUST LIKE IN SKIING WHERE LIKE PARALLEL SHOULDERS SQUARE OFF TO THE HILL WHAT YOU ARE GOING FOR CHROMATICALLY
HfCi4kYOYW0_2 0 HIS GOAL IS TO HIT IT RIGHT ABOVE THE TEN EITHER REAL SOFT SO IT JUST COMES OUT AS A WINNING DROP SHOT OR HE'S GOING TO ATTACK THE NECK
HfCi4kYOYW0_1 0 OKAY I'M GOING TO GIVE GARY A SERVE AND HE'S GOING TO ATTACK OFF THE SERVE WITH A DROP VOLLEY OR A DROP OR AN ATTACK AND VOLLEY
GdlXzDmgnSM_9 0 SO YOU WANT TO ATTACK THE BALL WHICH IS WHAT YOU WOULD DO DURING A PASSING PATTERN YOU WANT TO ATTACK THE BALL AND GET IT INTO YOUR POSSESSION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
hfnK2tC7AI8_17 0 SO NOW THEY GET A SENSE OF ATTACK THEY GET A SENSE OF A WEAPON AND THEY GET A SENSE OF WHAT TARGET IS BEING THREATENED SO THIS MAKES THE TECHNIQUE VERY EFFECTIVE
hiZFG0WGOL0_13 0 I BLEND WITH THE ATTACK AND HERE I AM
GeQZoFEa-aM_6 0 THEIR TERRITORY GENERALLY ONLY COVERS A SMALL AREA FOR EXAMPLE A SMALL CORAL HEAD IN THE SAND BUT THEY WILL ATTACK ANYTHING THAT GETS TOO CLOSE TO IT INCLUDING FISH MUCH LARGER THAN ITSELF
gKqjbqwlZAc_6 0 YOU DON'T WANT YOUR HANDS FLAT YOU WANT THEM ARCHED OVER WHETHER YOU'RE PLAYING A SCALE OR IF YOU'RE PLAYING A CHORD YOU WANT A CERTAIN LITTLE ARCH AND WITH YOUR PICKING HAND YOU SIMPLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO STRUM DOWN OR IF YOU'RE PICKING YOU WANT YOUR HAND VERY RELAXED YOUR ARM RESTED OVER LIKE OVER THIS OR EVEN IF THERE'S NOT A CONTOUR HERE EVEN IF IT'S A STRAIGHT YOU WANT YOUR HAND REACHING OVER THAT WHERE YOUR ATTACK IS OVER THE PICKUPS
HAeg9nVrfz0_14 0 REMEMBER AVOID THE ATTACK CONTROL THE SITUATION MAKE YOUR CHOICE CHOOSE YOUR OPTION
g_UQ1Ho2OcM_4 0 BUT SOMETIMES WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT THE DISTANCE OF OUR OPPONENT'S ATTACK WILL BE OR WE JUST NEED MORE DISTANCE TO PROTECT OURSELVES IN THAT CASE WE USE TOO QUICK BUT SHORT RETREATS TO AVOID OUR OPPONENT'S ATTACK
gH1sh_ECCcY_13 0 IF THE BASKETBALL IS GOING OFF THE LEFT SIDE YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACK THE LEFT SIDE
gH1sh_ECCcY_14 0 IF THE BALL GOES OFF THE RIGHT RIDE YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACK THE RIGHT SIDE
gH1sh_ECCcY_18 0 YOU'VE GOT TO DO THE FUNDAMENTALS FIRST THEN GO AND ATTACK THE BASKETBALL
GWMbThrwhXc_5 0 IN THIS CASE AGAIN ONE WILL MAKE ATTACK LOOKING TO HIT THE OTHER WILL EITHER DO COUNTER ATTACK OR MAKE IT SHORT AND TAKE OVER
GWMbThrwhXc_6 0 IN THIS CASE YOU SEE AS SHE'S MAKING HER ATTACK EMMA MAKES HER CUT AND ESCAPES SAFELY AVOIDING THE HIT
GWMbThrwhXc_3 0 WHEN LOOKING AT LONG DISTANCE DEFENSE OUR OPTIONS ARE OFTEN LIMITED TO EITHER MAKING THE ATTACK SHORT AND TAKING OVER OR DOING A COUNTERATTACK
gUKDEgVCQN8_10 0 THIS TIME RACHEL MAKES THE ATTACK RATHER THE PREPARATION AND EMMA WILL ATTACK AS SHE COMES FORWARD
GPQexF0elRE_16 0 OK IT'S VERY EASY FOR YOU TO ATTACK THAT WAY
HA1_r-jDfVk_2 0 IF AN ATTACK COMES TO YOUR CHEST YOU'LL USE PARRY FOUR LIKE SO
H82J12zeruU_11 0 AND SO HERE'S A BRUTE THAT'S CHARGING ME HERE BUT I'M GOING TO MELEE ATTACK HIM
H82J12zeruU_12 0 ANOTHER GOOD REASON TO USE THE MELEE ATTACK IS BECAUSE IT HELPS CONSERVE YOUR AMMUNITION WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S LIMITED
H2UbBPFSinc_8 0 THESE GUYS ATTACK THESE TWO GUYS ALRIGHT
gUKDEgVCQN8_8 0 IN THIS CASE EMMA BEGINS PREPARING HER ATTACK AND AS SHE DOES SHE IS HIT IN THE HEAD
gUKDEgVCQN8_4 0 THIS IS CALLED ATTACK IN PREPARATION
gUKDEgVCQN8_3 0 ONE OF THE THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND IS AS YOU ARE COMING FORWARD AND YOU ARE PREPARING TO MAKE YOUR ATTACK YOU ARE NOT ACTUALLY ATTACKING AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY BE SCORED AGAINST DURING THIS TIME IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFULLY
G_yLd9y2nLk_2 0 AND THIS IS THE TYPE OF BALL A BALL THAT IS IN FRONT OF YOU YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO STEP INTO IT AND KIND OF ATTACK THE PLAYER
gPGtzn5Xv1k_17 0 YOU'LL NOTICE ALSO HOW I'M GETTING OFF THE LINE OF THIS ATTACK RIGHT HERE
g_UQ1Ho2OcM_13 0 THE DISADVANTAGE IS THAT WHEN THEY DECIDE TO MAKE THEIR OWN ATTACK THEY'RE GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT FARTHER SO EACH HAS AN ADVANTAGE AND A DISADVANTAGE
hfTGKtfivm4_11 0 SO HE'S GOING TO ATTACK HE DOES A TSUKI WE CAN GO HERE
h_8Tw2-93JY_7 0 AND I'M GOING TO PULSE UP FOR THREE THIS IS GOING TO ATTACK THE TOP AND THE FRONT OF MY ABS

H2UbBPFSinc_14 0 THESE THREE GUYS ATTACK EITHER MAKE THE SHOT OR MISS THE SHOT
GFVxu_GWJZA_11 0 ONCE AGAIN TO ALL THOSE CREATURE DECK SET CREATURES GET BENEFITS FROM OTHER CREATURES THIS TOTALLY ANNIHILATES THEIR DECK BECAUSE THEIR CREATURES ARE NOT IN PLAY TO GET THE OTHER CREATURES BENEFITS AND BASICALLY THEY HAVE TO START OVER WITH BUILDING THEIR ARMY WHICH ALLOWS YOU TIME TO BREAK OUT YOUR SPELLS AND/OR ATTACK WITH YOUR CREATURES THAT ARE STILL IN PLAY
gtiaeinVHZ8_2 0 WHEN YOU ATTACK OR WHEN YOU ARE DEFENDING YOUR POKEMON HAS A RESISTANCE
gtiaeinVHZ8_9 0 I HAVE A RESISTANCE OF THIRTY WHICH MEANS I DON'T TAKE ANY DAMAGE AT ALL BECAUSE I TAKE THIRTY OFF WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS THEY ATTACK WITH
gtiaeinVHZ8_8 0 IT MAKES HIS ATTACK AND SCRATCHES FOR TEN
hK2vsJ-fbeY_8 0 YOU GET A NICE WASH WITHOUT ALL THE ATTACK AS IF AS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE USING STICKS
-h50JLzr254_19 0 SO A GOOD STRONG AND AGGRESSIVE ARMPIT ATTACK IS A VERY GOOD VITAL POINT TO KNOW FOR WOMEN IN SELF-DEFENSE
GGh8knFY2rw_7 0 AND I'M ALSO GOING TO ATTACK THE WRIST AS WELL
GlyZjKn2fI8_9 0 THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO ATTACK
hfnK2tC7AI8_3 0 A FAKE IS AN INDIRECT ATTACK AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE EASIEST OF ALL TECHNIQUE FAKES

gwL9fYY3zHA_6 0 ATTACK ATTACK ATTACK THE RIM ALRIGHT
gwL9fYY3zHA_5 0 SECOND THING IS ATTACK
