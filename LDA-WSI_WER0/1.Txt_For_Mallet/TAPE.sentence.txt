gWDGiVZGd1M_21 0 ONCE YOU REALLY LEARN HOW TO CUT A LINE YOU'LL SAVE A LOT OF TIME IF YOU DON'T NEED TO USE THE TAPE
gWDGiVZGd1M_22 0 TAPE DOES MAKE IT EASIER THOUGH
g9oJ4jVZcL8_19 0 THE REASON THAT I NEED IT IS BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE PUTTING SOME GOLD METAL FASTENERS INTO THE CARDBOARD TO HELP ME FASTEN THE BACK OF THE PICTURE FRAME AND THEN I'M GOING TO COVER IT WITH MASKING TAPE

g9oJ4jVZcL8_20 0 I'M GOING TO COVER THE FASTENERS WITH MASKING TAPE AND I DON'T WANT THEM TO SHOW THROUGH WHEN DECORATING THE PICTURE FRAME
hBP9dx2202c_2 0 SO IN ORDER TO GET THE PROPER DEPTH WE WANT TO MEASURE THE DIAMETER OF THE BOWL AND FOR THIS I'VE GOT A TAPE MEASURE AND IT IS ABOUT A NINE AND 1/2 INCH DEPTH OUR OUTSIDE DIAMETER AND THEN WE WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT OUR DEPTH IS AND FOR THAT WE USE A RULER ON THE VERY BACK OF THE BOWL AND THEN PUT A TAPE MEASURE FLAT UP AGAINST IT AND THAT TELLS US WE HAVE ROUGHLY ABOUT TWO AND 3/4 OF DEPTH
GF3Spd4wC4Q_4 0 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A WORK TAPE OR THE DEMO THAT HAD BEEN DONE OF THE SONGS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO RECORD AND THE MUSICIANS WILL ALL GATHER IN WITH CHARTS THAT YOUR SESSION LEADER HAS ALREADY MADE UP

HE5tiPfCQIo_5 0 SO YOU REALLY WANT TO PAINT TO ABOUT AN 1/4 OF INCH AWAY FROM YOUR TAPE LINE AND THEN FINISH THAT PART WITH THE BRUSH
HE5tiPfCQIo_4 0 WHAT THEY DO WHEN THEY ARE PAINTING WITH THE ROLLER IS THE TEMPTATION TO GO AND PAINT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TAPE LINE WHEN YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THE MORE PAINT YOU PUT ON THE TAPE YOU CREATE A SEAL SO THAT WHEN YOU PULL THE TAPE BACK YOU WIND UP PULLING THE PAINT AND MESSING UP A LOT OF GOOD WORK
GrX4FYYggsY_7 0 PUT IT OUT THERE AND IT ALSO HAS THESE GREAT LIKE STICKY TAPE ON THE BOTTOM

gWDGiVZGd1M_42 0 IF YOU'RE ALWAYS BRUSHING OFF THE TOP OF THAT TAPE THEN YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM
gWDGiVZGd1M_40 0 NOW THE TRICK TO USING TAPE IS YOU NEED TO BRUSH OFF THE TAPE AND NOT LET THE BRUSH ROLL UNDERNEATH IT
H3kuHP_DqR4_7 0 SO FOR THE WINDOW WE'VE ALREADY DRAWN THE WINDOW PERIMETER AND NOW I'M GOING TO LAY DOWN STICKY TAPE ALONG THE WINDOW PERIMETER
H3kuHP_DqR4_9 0 SO THERE WE HAVE THAT TAPE
H3kuHP_DqR4_8 0 THE KEY TO GOOD TAPING IS TO LET THE TAPE RELAX AS IT HITS THE CLOTH
GWnPJ-kSeJQ_11 0 JUST PUT A SMALL PIECE OF SCOTCH TAPE DOWN IN THE POSITION AND YOU TAKE IT TO THE MACHINE JUST LINE IT UP RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE FOOT
GWnPJ-kSeJQ_10 0 IS TO ACTUALLY TAPE YOU BUTTON ON THIS WAY IT DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE WHEN YOU STITCH IT

H0LHHbt00-E_12 0 DON'T PUT IT EXACTLY ON THE END BUT WE NEED TO LEAVE IT OVER A LITTLE BIT PROBABLY ABOUT HALF THE WIDTH OF THE TAPE AND THAT IS GOING TO BE TUCKED IN INTO THE BOTTOM AND GIVE IT MORE WHERE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT
H0LHHbt00-E_13 0 WE ARE GOING TO TUCK IT INTO THE SPINE AND THAT WILL PREVENT THE TAPE IF WE PUT IT RIGHT TO THE TOP
H0LHHbt00-E_10 0 WE TAKE OUR TAPE AND FOR THAT WE WILL NEED ABOUT TWO 1/2 INCHES
H0LHHbt00-E_11 0 SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TAPE
H0LHHbt00-E_17 0 NOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IN ORDER TO MAKE IT EASIER TO TUCK INSIDE AT THE EDGE WHERE THE CONTINUATION OF THE BOOK WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A LITTLE SNIP AND THE TAPE WILL HAVE ITS GROOVES OVER HERE AND ALSO ON THE OTHER SIDE
H0LHHbt00-E_14 0 SOMETIMES THE TAPE STARTS TO COME OFF AND GET STICKY
hcfCa5uY_eE_11 0 IF THEY DON'T STICK ORIGINALLY WITH THE GLUE YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE A SMALL PIECE OF MASKING TAPE OR SCOTCH TAPE TO HOLD THEM DOWN AND THAT SHOULD HOLD THEM IN PLACE UNTIL THEY'RE DRY
gCiyrgVaqR4_19 0 IN USING TAPE AND A COMPUTER TOGETHER BECAUSE I THINK YOU GET THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS THIS WAY TIME CODE WILL SYNC UP YOUR TAPE WITH YOUR PRO TOOLS AND THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPERT AND YOU MIGHT HAVE TO BOOK A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR AN HOUR ROOM TO DO IT BUT IF YOU RECORD YOUR DRUMS AND BASS TO TAPE SYNC THAT UP AND THEN PLAY YOUR GUITARS DO YOUR VOCALS DIGITALLY YOU REALLY DO HAVE THE MARRIAGE OF GETTING THE THE CERTAIN LOW END REPRESENTATION THAT TAPE GIVES AND THE WARMTH AND THE DEPTH THAT IT GIVES TO THAT RANGE AND STILL HAVING THE EASE OF EDITING AND AND TUNING AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS EASE OF OPERATION AND THE QUICKNESS THAT RECORDING IN THE DIGITAL REALM GIVES YOU
gCiyrgVaqR4_17 0 THERE'S A CERTAIN DEPTH THAT YOU CAN GET WITH TAPE THAT IS JUST INHERENT IN IT
gCiyrgVaqR4_16 0 TAPE ON THE OTHER HAND USUALLY COLORS IT BUT IN A VERY PLEASING WAY ADDS A NOISE FLOOR JUST A LITTLE HISS THAT KIND OF SETS THE EAR AS TO WHAT VOLUME TO EXPECT
gCiyrgVaqR4_11 0 IT'S A GREAT PLATFORM FOR WELL INSTEAD OF LUGGING A THOUSAND POUND TAPE MACHINE AROUND IT'S REALLY PORTABLE
gCiyrgVaqR4_13 0 NOT TO SAY THAT I DON'T LIKE TAPE IS TAPE IS ANY AUDIO ENGINEER'S GOD BUT THE DIGITAL FORUM DIGITAL REALM IS BECOMING MUCH MORE PROFICIENT A LOT CLEANER A LOT YOU KNOW THE FREQUENCY RANGE IS CHANGING SO THAT WE HAVE HIGHER RESOLUTIONS JUST LIKE YOU HAVE HD CAMERAS YOU HAVE HD MUSIC
gCiyrgVaqR4_12 0 IN CERTAIN WAYS IT'S BETTER THAN TAPE
Gk6i4jMLGEA_11 0 OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO FLIP THE TAPES OVER SO THIS TAPE NOW GOES OVER HERE AND THIS ONE COMES OVER HERE
Gk6i4jMLGEA_15 0 LOCK THEM BACK DOWN FROM THE HUB AND THEN TIGHTEN THE TAPE UP ONTO THE REEL LIKE SO
_Gkvdc7Yw4U_4 0 WHAT I GENERALLY DO IS AGAIN FROM THERE JUST HIT PLAY FROM WHEREVER YOU CUT IT OFF AT THE END OF THE LAST TRACK GIVE IT A GOOD FIVE TO TEN SECONDS HIT STOP THEN WE CAN ZERO IT OUT AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE YOU'RE IN A DIFFERENT POINT IN THE TAPE BUT YOU CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND START RECORDING ANOTHER SONG

GHZWJIWLHXg_10 0 ALSO YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE A TAPE MEASURE OR A RULER TO SPACE THE PLANTS EXACTLY EVENLY APART
gweXLTNbtRk_4 0 SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS GO AHEAD AND REMOVE THE TAPE SINCE WE KNOW THERE IS OIL IN THE ENGINE AGAIN AND WE ARE GOING TO START THE VEHICLE AND LET IT RUN MAYBE TWENTY OR THIRTY SECONDS IS ENOUGH TIME AND ALLOW THE OIL FILTER TO FILL UP COMPLETELY WITH OIL
Ge0XcVD1xtY_15 0 LAY YOU ACETATE OVER TOP TAKE A PIECE OF PACKING TAPE RUN IT DOWN THE SIDE OVER HERE AND MAKE SURE IT'S NICE AND SMOOTH
gqvTWjowYGo_15 0 HOPEFULLY THE MEASURING TAPE WILL HELP YOU OUT

H3kuHP_DqR4_12 0 IF YOU TRIM CLOCK WISE AROUND YOU CAN GET THE SCISSOR EDGE RIGHT NEXT TO THE TAPE
Gl22jqt_ZZM_6 0 I HAVE HEARD OF PEOPLE REPAIRING IT WITH DUCT TAPE AND IT ACTUALLY LASTED FOR A WHILE LIKE I THINK YOU COULD DO THAT IF YOU WERE ON A TREK AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE A QUICK FIX AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING WITH YOU BUT WHAT I'VE FOUND BEST IS ACTUALLY EPOXY
Gw8PFSzolmg_8 0 YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK OBVIOUSLY BUT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY PUT A LAYER OF PAINT ALONG THE OUTER EDGES WHICH ARE WHICH WERE COVERED WITH MASKING TAPE
Gw8PFSzolmg_7 0 NOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO GO AROUND THE SIDES TOO WHERE WE PUT THE MASKING TAPE
Gw8PFSzolmg_2 0 NOW I'M NOT SO WORRIED ABOUT THE TEXTURE UNDERNEATH OF THE MASKING TAPE AND THE WHITE BASE PAINT WHICH ALSO WENT ON KIND OF THICK BECAUSE THE TEXTURE IS KIND OF A I KIND OF LIKE HAVING A THE LITTLE BIT OF TEXTURE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PICTURE FRAME
Ge0XcVD1xtY_3 0 YOU NEED PACKING TAPE YOUR ACETATE AND THE NEWSPRINT
