IF OUR BLADE IF HER BLADE DOES MAKE CONTACT WITH MINE THEN I THEN I RISK LOSING RIGHT-OF-WAY BEING COUNTED AS BEING PARRIED AND OF COURSE THEN THE VULNERABILITY IS MINE AND MY OPPONENT'S MOST LIKELY TO SCORE A TOUCH
SO GO AHEAD AND CONTACT THEM APPLE IS YOUR BEST BET TO GET THINGS DONE
IN OTHER WORDS WHEN I CREATED MY DATABASE I CREATED CONTACT LAST NAME BUT THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY WHAT THE MICROSOFT WORD WILL RECOGNIZE IT AS
THEN YOU'VE GOT THE CONTACT INFORMATION OF THE LOCATION PROBABLY VERY IMPORTANT TO FILL THIS OUT ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE COLLABORATING IN YOUR CELTX PROJECT MAYBE ONE PERSON GRABS HIS CONTACT INFORMATION AND PUTS IT RIGHT HERE AND THEN EVERYBODY COULD SEE IT
ONCE YOU GET IT IN CONTACT WITH THE SOIL AND IF YOU HAVE GOOD SOIL TO SEED CONTACT AND YOU PUT MOISTURE ON IT THE SEED SHOULD GERMINATE UNDER THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE CONDITION SHOULD GERMINATE AND FORM A NEW PLANT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE IT A LITTLE BIT UNDER THE GROUND
APPLY IN A SIDE MOTION WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SQUIGGLE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PIGMENT IS MAKING GOOD CONTACT WITH THE CANVAS
WE WANT TO CONTACT THAT BALL FULL AND WE WANT TO HIT IT AS FAST AS WE CAN
FOR MORE INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT ME AT JOHNGRADEN.COM

ONE THING THAT YOU NEED TO REMEMBER ABOUT TELLING THE WHOLE CROWD WHAT YOUR PLATFORM IS THAT YOU NEED TO STAND UP STRAIGHT AND HAVE GOOD POSTURE AND WHATEVER YOU DO HAVE EYE CONTACT WITH THE JUDGES AND THE CROWD SO THAT YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE VERY CONFIDENT AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
ONCE WE FIND OUR MAN WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO HIM WE'RE GOING TO MAKE CONTACT WE'RE GOING TO STAND HIM UP AND NOT ALLOW HIM TO GO AROUND US
WE WANT TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH THE PERSON
IF THEY HAVE A CONTACT NUMBER FEEL FREE TO CALL THEIR NUMBER AND ASK SOME QUESTIONS
IT HAS BASICALLY ONE CONTACT THAT IT MAKES WITH THAT PLUG
IF WE KIND OF PLUG IT IN THERE YOU CAN SEE THAT CONTACT GOES IN RIGHT THERE
IT ONLY HAS THE ONE KIND OF CONTACT
THESE WILL ALSO PREVENT CONTACT POINTS OF YOUR SKIN BETWEEN YOUR THIGHS
NOW WHEN SHE MAKES CONTACT HERE MY HAND IN THE BEGINNING IS JUST GOING TO MEET IT JUST AS THE TARGET OKAY AND NOW AS SHE MAKES CONTACT SHE LIFTS HER HANDS UP AND BRING IT RIGHT BACK AGAIN AGAIN
BALL COMES OFF THE RIM IT'S POSITION FIRST CONTACT FIRST YOU'RE MAKING SURE YOU FEEL THE OTHER GUY FIRST AND THEN YOU GO FOR THE BALL
BECAUSE THE BEAD WHEN IT GOES INTO THE KILN IT DOES NOT RISK GETTING INTO CONTACT WITH ELECTRODES THAT ARE LOCATED ABOVE BECAUSE THERE'S A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE UPPER CHAMBER AND THE BOTTOM CHAMBER
IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP CLOSE CONTACT WITH THESE PEOPLE AS THEY WILL BECOME GOOD CONTACTS FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
FEEL THE CONTACT OF THE PEN WITH THE PAPER
NOW REMEMBER ONCE YOU GET PAST FIVE YARDS YOU CAN NO LONGER MAKE CONTACT WITH THAT GUY YOU HAVE JUST GOT TO RUN WITH HIM
THE FIRST PART OF TAKING THIS PRINT OUT OF THE CONTACT PRINTER IS SQUEEZING THESE CLIPS IN THE BACK AND THAT PULLS IT OUT
OR MAYBE IF YOU DIDN'T NEED A PRESCRIPTION WITHOUT ANY CONTACT LENS AT ALL
IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT PURCHASING COLORED CONTACT LENSES
TO ACTUALLY CATCH A COLD VIRUS THOUGH YOU HAVE TO BE EXPOSED TO IT WHICH MEANS IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THROUGH CLOSE CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE THE VIRUS IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THROUGH NOT VERY SANITARY CONDITIONS WHERE YOU ARE TOUCHING THINGS THAT HAVE GERMS ON THEM STUFF LIKE THAT
SO IF MY OPPONENT ATTEMPTS TO BEAT MY BLADE AND I DISENGAGE BEFORE SHE MAKES CONTACT I'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND OF COURSE SINCE I HAVE MAINTAINED THAT RIGHT-OF-WAY AND AVOIDED HER ATTEMPT TO TAKE IT FROM ME I WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT IMMEDIATELY WITH THE THRUST
SO IF YOUR OPPONENT TRIES TO BIND OR TO BEAT YOUR BLADE AND YOU SUCCESSFULLY AVOID CONTACT COMPLETELY WHILE MAINTAINING YOUR RIGHT-OF-WAY THEN YOU'VE PULLED OFF A SUCCESSFUL ONE
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A SMOOTH CLEAN-CUT CONTACT
WHEN YOU CONTACT THE PAVER YOU WANT TO ASK HIM TO COME OUT AND TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR JOB AND GIVE YOU A WRITTEN ESTIMATE SIGNED BY HIM
ESPECIALLY KEEP AN EYE OUT TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY RUB OR WEAR MARK'S THERE TO THAT YOU WILL GIVE YOU AN IDEA THAT THE HARD PLASTIC AND NOT THE SOFT RUBBER IS MAKING CONTACT WITH THE BOTTOM
IF YOU DON'T FEEL ANY BUMPS OR RESISTANCE LIKE YOU DO HERE THAT MEANS WELL IT'S NOT MAKING CONTACT WITH THE BOTTOM OF POOL AND THE BOTTOM OF THE PODS HERE MAYBE DOING THAT
ANY BIGGER THAN THAT AND YOU'VE GOT A FREAK OF NATURE ON YOUR HANDS AND I SUGGEST YOU CONTACT SOMEBODY ABOUT MAKING SOME MONEY
THIS IS WHEN THE BATTER SWINGS THE BAT AND MAKES CONTACT WITH THE CATCHER'S GLOVE OR THE CATCHER GETS IN THE WAY SOMEHOW OF THE BATTER SO HE DOES GET ON BASE
THIS IS A WAY TO GET OUT IN THE GAME OF BASEBALL MEANING THAT THE BATTER HAS MADE CONTACT WITH A FIELDER
SO THESE ARE MY NEGATIVES THAT WE DEVELOPED AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY MAKE A PRINT A CONTACT SHEET FROM THEM WHICH IS GOING TO LOOK SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THIS
WHOEVER SAID BASKETBALL WASN'T A CONTACT SPORT HAS NEVER PLAYED THE GAME
THEN WE'RE GOING TO READ OFF THE CONTACT SHEET AND DECIDE WHAT IMAGE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A PRINT FROM
SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SPIN MY HOOK AROUND SO THAT MY THREAD IS HANGING DOWN NOT MAKING CONTACT WITH THAT SHARP POINT AND I'M READY TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STEP
YOU MIGHT WANT TO FLIP THROUGH YOUR PHONE BOOK AND CONTACT YOUR LOCAL YMCA OR YOUR LOCAL RED CROSS CENTER
THE CHINESE SAILORS THEY STARTED TO DO TRADE WITH THE OKINAWA THE SMALL ISLAND THAT IS SOUTH OF JAPAN AND THAT IS WHERE THEY CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE OKINAWANS

WIDE BASE ARMS OUT ESTABLISH CONTACT LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY BALL COMES OFF YOU'RE AT LEAST TWO FEET AWAY FROM THE RIM ESTABLISH CONTACT FIRST THEN AGGRESSIVELY GET THE BASKETBALL
SO JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU KEEP YOUR ELBOWS CLOSE TO YOUR BODY AND YOU CONTACT THE BALL AT THIS POINT IN FRONT OF YOU
THE OTHER THING IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T FEEL RIGHT REALIZE IS IF DOESN'T FIT PROPERLY THE CONTACT LENS MOVES AROUND WHICH HENCE BRINGS THE COLOR INTO YOUR LINE OF SIGHT SO YOU'RE NOT SEEING AS CLEARLY AS YOU WOULD WITH A CLEAR CONTACT LENS
THE OTHER PRO IS SOME PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME SEEING THE CONTACT LENS WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING IT IN OR IF IT DROPS THEY CAN'T SEE IT
THE MAJOR DISTRIBUTOR OF COLORED CONTACT LENSES IN THE WORLD ONLY HAS ONE SIZE OF CONTACT LENS AND IT'S LARGE
IF YOUR PRESCRIPTION'S BAD ENOUGH MAYBE THE CLEAR CONTACT LENSES DON'T CUT IT SO THE COLOR ACTUALLY HELPS YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE THE CONTACT LENS IS IN RELATION TO YOUR EYE IT MAY BE EASIER TO PUT IN
AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF AN ACTION DO WE NEED TO HAVE ON THE CUE BALL ON CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT BALL IN ORDER TO GET IT TO STOP
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE PRINTING WITH CONTACT PRINTING FRAMES TO REMEMBER YOUR NEGATIVE
WHAT THE CONTACT PAPER IS DOING IS IT'S HOLDING YOUR GLASS FLUSHED TO THE EDGE OF THE MOLD
THE ELBOWS ARE IN TIGHT TO THE BODY THIS WAY AND AGAIN AS YOU MEET THE PUNCH YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTACT AND A LITTLE BIT OF TENSION PUSHING IN AND DOWNWARD
AND SO ANYWHERE THERE'S A CONTACT POINT OF METAL ON METAL OR EVEN THIS PLASTIC OR BONE THAT COMPRISES THE NUT IT'S A PLACE WHERE STRING COULD BREAK
YOU NEED TO CONTACT A LOCAL GARBAGE HAULER
AND IT'S AN AMAZING LEARNING TOOL IF YOU JUST KEEP MAKING CONTACT SHEETS AND JUST LOOKING AT THEM THAT WAY
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WAY YOU PHOTOGRAPH ON A CONTACT SHEET YOU WILL SEE THE RHYTHM OF YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY
AND THEN FURTHER DOWN THE PAGE YOU'LL HAVE YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION
SO WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO START TO GO INTO THE DARKROOM AND ACTUALLY MAKE OUR CONTACT SHEETS
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN PRINTING WITH A CONTACT PRINTER OR PIECE OF GLASS THAT HAS SCRATCHES AND DIRT ALL OVER IT
IF YOU BOX OUT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE FEELING CONTACT FIRST BEFORE YOU GO FOR THE BALL
IF YOU JUST GO FOR THE BALL WITHOUT ESTABLISHING CONTACT A REALLY SMART PLAYER LIKE MYSELF WILL SLIDE IN FRONT OF YOU AND BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THE POSITION
THIS IS BASICALLY GOING TO INTRODUCE THE READER TO WHAT YOUR PLAY IS TITLED WHO YOU ARE AND YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION
AND THEN AFTER THE NEGATIVES ARE ON TOP OF THE PAPER YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A SHEET OF GLASS OR A CONTACT SHEET PRINTER
A CONTACT SHEET IS YOUR NEGATIVES AND YOU LAY THEM ON TOP OF A PIECE OF PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPER IN THE DARK ROOM
SO I'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT WHILE WE'RE IN THE LIGHT HERE RATHER THAN IN THE DARK ROOM ABOUT REALLY JUST WHAT A CONTACT SHEET IS
SO I'VE CREATED A KNOB CONTROL AND A BODY CONTACT THAT I CAN TOUCH AND NOW I HAVE A WAY OF ACTUALLY PLAYING THIS ELECTRONIC MUSICAL INSTRUMENT
