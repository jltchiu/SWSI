SO YOU CAN GET QUITE A WORKOUT DOING THIS DRILL BECAUSE THE FRONT COURT CAN GET PRETTY BIG
SO THAT'S THE SHORT COURT GAME
FRONT COURT LOB AND THE STRAIGHT DROP
ALSO YOU CAN SIDE STEP AND WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS JUST FOCUS ON THIS AT HOME AND HAVE AN AREA OF YOUR HOUSE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO USE A COURT JUST DO THE FOUR STEP THREE STEP AND THE TWO STEP AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT YOU CAN START COVERING THIS AREA VERY EFFICIENTLY AND THAT IS THE KEY TO A GOOD GAME SO WORK YOUR STEPS BREAK THE GAME DOWN INTO THESE LITTLE BITE SIZE CHUNKS AND YOU WILL SEE YOUR MOVEMENT SKILLS REALLY IMPROVE
SO IF MY TEAM WERE TO SERVE THE BALL AND WE GET AN IN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE COURT WE GET IT IN THE SQUARE AND ON THE GROUND WE GET A POINT
YOU COULD DEFINITELY USE A TENNIS COURT WHICH WILL DEFINITELY HELP YOUR GAME BUT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED THAT
YOU CAN ALWAYS PLAY TENNIS ON THE SIDE OF A WALL OR A BACKBOARD SO A TENNIS COURT IS DEFINITELY OPTIONAL WHEN IT'S COMING TO PLAYING TENNIS
THAT IS JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED TO KEEP IN MIND WHENEVER YOU ARE PLAYING RIGHT AROUND THAT HALF COURT LINE
NOW WHEN YOU ARE FIRST TAKING THE BALL OUT YOU WANT TO YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO CROSS THE HALF COURT LINE BEFORE EIGHT TO TEN SECONDS
IT USED TO BE TEN SECONDS IN MY DAY WHEN I PLAYED BUT I HAVE SEEN WHERE THEY HAVE COUNTED EIGHT SO YOU WANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND WHENEVER YOU ARE PLAYING BALL THAT YOU GOT TO CROSS THAT HALF COURT LINE AND YOU CAN NEVER CAN NEVER PASS IT BACK ACROSS THAT LINE ONCE YOU HAVE CROSSED OVER INTO THE OFFENSE THE FRONT COURT
WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A HALF COURT LINE YOU WANT TO ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND THAT ONCE YOU CROSS AS A TEAM ANYONE ON THE OFFENSE ONCE YOU CROSS BACK ACROSS THAT LINE ONCE YOU CROSS THAT LINE YOU CAN NOT CROSS BACK
THAT IS CALLED BACK COURT VIOLATION
ONE OTHER THING WHEN YOU TALKING ABOUT THE HALF COURT LINE IT COMES ACROSS RIGHT ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE COURT
LATHER IT UP AN HOUR BEFORE YOU GET ON THE TENNIS COURT SO THAT YOU CAN BEST PROTECT YOURSELF
FIRST OF ALL IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW SOME BASICS OFF THE COURT
SO EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE THEORETICALLY IN FRONT OF THIS LINE SO WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO CHALLENGE EACH OTHER BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN THE FRONT COURT
THEY CAN MAKE ARRESTS BUT MOST OF THE TIME WHAT YOU SEE FROM THE US MARSHAL AGENTS OFFICERS ARE THEY'RE IN FEDERAL COURT THAT IS WHAT THEY SPECIALIZE IN
SO YOU WANT TO DO SOME STRETCHES GET WARMED UP AND BE ABLE TO GET ON THE COURT QUICKLY
IT'S CALLED THE ULTIMATE FAST BREAK DRILL OR SOME PEOPLE CALL IT THE TWELVE MAN FAST BREAK DRILL BECAUSE IT'S CONTINUOUS IT GOES ON FOREVER AND THERE'S PEOPLE IN THE COURT
SO WATCH HIS LEFT FOOT AS IT COMES AROUND FOR THIS FOREHAND STEPPING INTO THE COURT
SO WHAT GUSTAVO HERE IS GOING TO DO IS HE IS GOING TO STEP FORWARD INTO THE COURT HE IS GOING TO BASICALLY HIT CROSS COURT BUT STEPPING TOWARDS THAT DIRECTION WITH HIS LEFT FOOT
ITS NOT ADMISSABLE IN COURT SO DON'T GO HOME AND TEST YOUR KIDS AND BEAT THEM IF IT DOESN'T TURN OUT RIGHT
AND THEN DON'T FORGET ABOUT DRESSING COMFORTABLY MOST COURT ROOMS ARE VERY VERY COLD SO YOU'LL PROBABLY WANT TO DRESS IN LAYERS THEN WHEN YOU GET THERE IF IT'S COLD YOU'VE DRESSED APPROPRIATELY IF IT'S NOT THAT COLD YOU CAN REMOVE SOME OF THE LAYERS
WELL THAT OF COURSE VARIES FROM STATE TO STATE AND ALSO MAY VARY DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR COURT THAT YOU'VE BEEN SUMMONED FOR JURY DUTY BUT BASICALLY USE COMMON SENSE
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE PLAYING A MATCH TRY TO COME TO THE TENNIS COURT AND WARM UP THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE AT LEAST FIFTEEN MINUTES SO YOU HAVE GOOD TEN MINUTES TO WARM UP YOUR BODY BEFORE YOU START WITH A MATCH
WE HELP THEM THROUGH THE GRIEVING PROCESS WITH COUNSELING SERVICES AS WELL AS COURT ACCOMPANIMENT
WHEN YOU KEEP YOUR HAND OPEN YOU HAVE MORE SURFACE AREA ON THE BALL WHICH CAN HELP YOU TO GUIDE THE BALL TO WHERE YOU WANT IT TO GO ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE COURT
SO A LOT OF TIME PEOPLE DON'T GET ENOUGH PRACTICE ON THEIR LOBS SO DOING THIS VERSION OF THE BOAST DRIVE DRILL IT'S ANOTHER DRIVE WE'RE GOING TO HIT A BOAST CROSS COURT WE'RE GOING TO HIT A LOB
THE SOLES ON THE SHOES CAN LEAVE SCUFFS ON A TENNIS COURT WHICH TEND TO RUIN THE COURT A LITTLE BIT FASTER
FROM COMING UP HERE WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE BALL OUTSIDE THE COURT ON THIS SIDE TO COME IN A LITTLE MORE BACK AND CORRECT THAT MISTAKE YOU'RE MAKING
IF YOUR BALL IS GOING TOO MUCH TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE COURT THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE HITTING IT PROBABLY TOO MUCH IN FRONT OF YOU
IT'S REALLY MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN YOU'RE USING IT ON THE SIDE OF THE COURT
THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO LINE IT UP FOR ALL YOUR CUPS MAKE A HALF COURT LINE JUST LIKE I WAS TELLING YOU BEFORE
AND ONE OTHER THING AS SOON AS YOU PUT UP YOUR TABLE MAKE SURE TO DRAW A BASKETBALL COURT ON IT ALRIGHT
SO IF MY TEAM SERVES THE BALL BUT YET THE OTHER TEAM GETS THE BALL AND PUTS IT INTO OUR SIDE OF THE COURT THEY GET THE POINT EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T SERVE THE BALL AND VICE VERSA
NOW ON THE FOREHAND SIDE YOU CAN GO LEFT BIG AND RIGHT AND YOU CAN COVER A HUGE AMOUNT OF COURT AND YOU USUALLY DO THAT WHEN YOU ARE UNDER SOME TYPE OF PRESSURE AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE IN THE STRONGEST POSITION SO YOU CAN SEE IF YOU ARE HERE YOU'RE IN KIND OF A RELATIVELY WEAK POSITION AND YOU CAN TURN IT AROUND AND IT WILL BE A GOOD SHOT BUT GETTING TO THE CORNER IN A MORE UPRIGHT POSITION IS BETTER
DRIBBLING UP AND DOWN THE COURT
SO THAT'S THE LOB BOAST DRILL AND IT WORKS ON YOUR CROSS COURT LOB LIKE NO OTHER DRILL
IF YOU ARE WEARING COURT ROOM ATTIRE OR BUSINESS SUIT OF SOME SORT AND THE PANTS FIT LOOSELY YOU COULD ACTUALLY ATTACH THIS TO THE INSIDE OF YOUR ANKLE AND PUT YOUR PANTS OVER IT AND YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW
THE FORWARD ACTUALLY SMALL FORWARD WILL HAVE THIS RESPONSIBILITY OUT HERE ANYTHING BEYOND THAT POINT GUARDS REACH IS ON THIS SIDE OF THE COURT WILL BE THAT SMALL FORWARDS RESPONSIBILITY
