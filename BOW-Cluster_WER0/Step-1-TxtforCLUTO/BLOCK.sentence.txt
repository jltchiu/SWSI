SO HER RIGHT KNEE IS UP CRANE HER RIGHT ARM IS IN ROLLING BLOCK AND LEFT HAND IS OUT TO THE SIDE
THE WAY IT LOOKS WITH AN OPPONENT AS THEY THROW THEIR REVERSE PUNCH YOU ARE GOING TO BLOCK WITH THE PALM TWIST THE WEIGHT PICK THE FIST UP AND JUST DRIVE IT STRAIGHT ALONG THE ARM AND HIT SQUARE IN THE FACE ONE TWO JUST LIKE THAT
NOW IT'S CALLED A SLIP PUNCH BECAUSE AS YOU DO THE PALM BLOCK YOU ACTUALLY SLIP THE HAND JUST PAST THE BLOCK AND PAST THE ARM AIMING STRAIGHT FOR THE FACE
MY NAME IS WES RHODES FROM THE CHINESE KUNG FU ACADEMY FROM EXPERT VILLAGE AND THIS IS KUNG FU SPARRING TECHNIQUE INSIDE PALM BLOCK SLIP PUNCH
I HAVE A FOAM BLOCK IN THE FRONT OF MY BOAT
IF YOU STAY THERE AND TRY TO BLOCK IT COMES BACK
I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND START TO TAKE MY SANDING BLOCK
SO YOU HAVE TO TURN THE BLOCK A LITTLE TO THE SIDE TO FIT INSIDE THIS SHAPE OF THE CONCAVE
AGAIN MY NAME IS WES RHODES I'M FROM THE CHINESE KUNG FU ACADEMY AND THAT IS DOUBLE PALM BLOCK COUNTER VERSUS ROUND KICK
WHEN HE SEES HIS BUTT HE GOES THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION BECAUSE THAT'S THE FLOW OF THE BLOCK
AS YOU SEE THERE'S A GUARD THAT IS CURLED WHICH CAN PROTECT YOUR HAND AND HELP YOU PARRING HELP YOU BLOCK YOUR OPPONENT'S ATTACKS
SO I'M GOING TO PUT THAT BLOCK DOWN AND CHOP IT INTO SOME QUARTER INCH PIECES
YOU CAN CLICK BLOCK THIS USER AND NOW THIS USER IS NOW BLOCKED AND ON THIS PAGE IT SAYS BLOCKED USERS SO KEEP A RUNNING TOTAL OR SHOWS ALL THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE BLOCKED AND THEY CAN NO LONGER VIEW YOUR PROFILE OR SEE YOUR PICTURES OF ANYTHING LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU UNBLOCK THEM
IT'LL ASK YOU IF YOU'RE SURE YOU WANT TO BLOCK THE USER AND YOU CLICK OK AND THEN IT WANTS TO CONFIRM THAT YOU'RE SURE YOU WANT TO BLOCK THIS USER
AS I SLOWLY GO UP THE MOUNTING BLOCK REMEMBER TO KEEP A HOLD OF THE REINS
HI MY NAME IS DAN SCHMIDT FROM THE CHINESE MARTIAL ARTS CENTER IN SEMINOLE AND TODAY IN THIS CLIP WE ARE GOING TO BE PERFORMING THE OVERHEAD BLOCK
SO FOR THIS TYPE OF BLOCK YOU WANT TO START WITH THE THUMB TO THUMB GRIP
FROM HERE THE TYPE OF BLOCK YOU WANT TO PRESS UP OVERHEAD YOU CAN STEP BACK AND HAVE IT GOING STRAIGHT ACROSS THIS WAY
SO IF THEY SMASH STRAIGHT OVERHEAD THIS WAY IF YOU BLOCK STRAIGHT LIKE THIS AND YOU DON'T HAVE A VERY STRONG GRIP IT WILL PRESS STRAIGHT DOWN AND SMASH YOUR OWN WEAPON INTO YOU PLUS THEIRS
OKAY SO HE PUNCHES OKAY YOU CAN BLOCK LEAN IN DISGUIDES HIM IN THEN PUNCH AGAIN
THIS IS HOW WE PERFORM OUR TRANSITION KICK PUNCH TO SCRAPE BLOCK SIDE PUNCH
FROM HERE I'M GOING TO BRING THE FOOT DOWN STEP OUT BOW THE RIGHT HAND PERFORMS SCRAPING BLOCK AND THEN THE BODY SNAPS INTO SIDE PUNCH
YOU'LL PLACE THE BLOCK ON ITS TALL END IN THE ABDOMEN EITHER JUST ABOVE THE PUBIC BONE OR JUST BELOW THE RIBS AND YOU CAN DO IT IN BOTH PLACES
BASICALLY YOU JUST NEED A YOGA BLOCK AND YOU'LL SIT ON ANY SURFACE ANY FIRM SURFACE A YOGA MAT HELPS
THEY WAY THIS TECHNIQUE WORKS YOU CAN USE BOTH HANDS TO BLOCK SLIDING THE ROUND KICK PAST YOU AND DRIVING IT IN WITH THE RIGHT HAND
I COULD DO A STRONG BLOCK OR A SOFT BLOCK
SHANNON'S GOING TO STEP OUT AND MAKE AN OFFER AND I'M GOING TO BLOCK THAT OFFER
YOU ARE STILL LEFT HAND CHAMBERED AND STEP TO THE RIGHT SIDE OPEN THE RIGHT HAND PALM BLOCK
THIS IS HOW TO PALM BLOCK DODGING PALM BLOCK CAT STANCE LUNGE PUNCH
YOU ARE GOING TO STEP TO THE SIDE WITH YOUR LEFT FOOT PALM BLOCK
SO IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR VERTEBRAE OR YOUR BACK ARE ROUNDING BACK BECAUSE YOU'RE HAM STRINGS ARE TIGHT YOUR ABDOMINALS ARE TIGHT THAT MEANS YOU NEED TO SIT UP ON A BLANKET OR A BLOCK UNTIL YOU CAN GET A CURVE IN YOUR LOWER BACK
NOW THAT'S WHERE THAT BLOCK COMES IN HANDY YOU CAN REST YOUR HAND RIGHT UP ON THE BLOCK YOU CAN LAY THE BLOCK DOWN FOR SECURITY OR YOU CAN TAKE YOUR HAND RIGHT DOWN TO THE FOOT BUT IN ANY CASE YOUR EYES STAY ON THAT LEFT HAND
NOW WHEN I GO INTO MY HANDSTAND I M GOING TO BLOCK WITH MY SHOULDERS
I M GOING TO BLOCK WITH MY SHOULDERS
AND OVER WE HAVE SINCE THIS IS A CREATURE CARD A SMALL BLOCK THAT HAS NUMBERS IN IT
SO IF YOU NEED TO AT ANY POINT GO AHEAD AND RE-ADJUST YOURSELF MAYBE PLACE THE BLOCK A LITTLE CLOSER MAKE SURE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE
AND THEN LASTLY THEY GET A BLOCK OF PROTEIN AND THIS IS THAT ZOOPREEN FELINE DIET THAT I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT
IN THE BLOCK HERE YOU'RE GOING TO FIND WHAT THIS CARD'S SPECIAL ABILITIES ARE
THAT WOULD BE A BLOCK
THERE'S A SOFT BLOCK WHICH IS JUST BEING NEGATIVE GRUMPY OR JUST POO POO ABOUT THE OFFER
ALRIGHT SO THAT'S A BLOCK YOU KNOW HE'S JUST SAYING NO
WE DECIDED TO USE MOZZARELLA TODAY INSTEAD OF THE HAVARTI OR THE MUNSTER AND WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO IS ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR HALF OF EIGHT OZ BLOCK OF CHEESE I'M JUST GOING TO CUBE IT
THIS IS AN EIGHT OZ BLOCK OF CHEESE THAT I SET ON THE PLATE THAT I'LL LATER USE TO SERVE THE MACA-RAMONS AND CHEESE
NOW WITH THIS TECHNIQUE YOU USE THE LEAD HAND TO BLOCK YOU ARE GOING TO BLOCK WITH THE LEFT HAND LIKE THIS SPIN THE WAIST OVER TO THE LEFT DROP THE RIGHT LEG DOWN AND FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE HOOK KICK
MY NAME IS WES RHODES FROM THE CHINESE KUNG FU ACADEMY FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND THIS IS HOW YOU PERFORM KUNG FU SPARRING COMBINATION OUTSIDE PALM BLOCK REAR LEG HOOK KICK
THE WAY THIS TECHNIQUE WORKS WITH AN OPPONENT IS I PUNCH WITH THE LEFT AND BLOCK WITH THE LEFT HAND SHOOT THE RIGHT LEG IN KIND OF LIKE YOU WERE GOING TO KICK THE LOWER LEG EXCEPT YOU ARE GOING TO PASS BY BRING THE RIGHT LEG AROUND AND HIT WITH THE HEEL OR THE BALL OF THE FOOT
MY NAME IS WES RHODES I'M FROM THE CHINESE KUNG FU ACADEMY AND FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND THIS IS KUNG FU SPARRING TECHNIQUE DOUBLE PALM BLOCK REVERSE PUNCH VERSUS ROUND KICK
IF YOU PUT ALL OF THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES TOGETHER IN ONE BIG MASHED BLOCK LIKE THIS THEY WILL EAT BOTH THEIR GREENS AND THEIR BERRIES TOGETHER AND THEY WON'T PICK AND CHOOSE WHAT'S HEALTHY AND WHAT'S NOT
AFTER THE SLASH IS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CARDS IN THIS BLOCK OR EXPANSION BLOCK
IF YOU CAN'T COMFORTABLY STACK YOUR FEET AND SIT HERE WITH YOUR KNEES FOLLOWING BELOW THE LEVEL OF YOUR WASTE THEN COME TO A BLOCK OR A BLANKET BRING YOUR SIT BONES UP A LITTLE BIT UNTIL YOUR KNEES SETTLE DOWN UNTIL YOU'RE COMFORTABLE AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY TENSION IN YOUR HIPS
SO SHE'S GOING TO INHALE AND LENGTHEN AND AS SHE EXHALES SHE'S GOING TO ROTATE TOWARDS HER KNEE GOOD AND THEN PRESS HER HAND INTO THE BLOCK
BUT WE HAVE TO GET TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN BLOCK THEM OUT AND FOCUS
AGAIN MY NAME IS WES RHODES AND I'M FROM THE CHINESE KUNG FU ACADEMY AND THAT IS HOW TO PERFORM THE OUTSIDE PALM BLOCK REAR LEG HOOK KICK
HE'S NOT GOING TO SEE BRYAN COMING THIS IS WHY IT'S A STALK BLOCK
SO SET GO SWIM HE'S GONE AND THERE YOU'VE GOT YOUR STALK BLOCK
WHEN THE PAPER IS HOT ON A GRIDDLE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TOUCH THAT WAX BLOCK YOU SEE AND YOU CAN DIRECTLY PAINT WITH THE WAX
NOW ON ONE OF THESE ON THE RIGHT IT IS DRAWN A LOT WITH THE WAX DIRECTLY IN BLOCK FORM ON THE PAPER ITSELF
SO THAT WAS A LITTLE DEMONSTRATION IN WHAT IT MEANS TO BLOCK AND BLOCKING OFFERS CORRIDORS
YOU SHOULD ONLY BLOCK OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS WHEN IT REALLY SERVES THE STORY
OFTENTIMES WE BLOCK JUST BECAUSE WE'RE FEELING NERVOUS
OF COURSE SOMETIMES IN SCENES YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO BLOCK
WHICH IS JUST USUALLY OFF OF THE BASIC BLOCK BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE EXPANSION CARDS THEY AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THESE CARDS ABILITIES MEAN
AGAIN MY NAME IS WES RHODES AND I'M FROM THE CHINESE KUNG FU ACADEMY AND THIS IS KUNG FU SPARRING TECHNIQUE PALM BLOCK SLIP PUNCH
SO IF I MADE AN OFFER AND SHANNON MADE A STRONG BLOCK LIKE IF I SAID WOULD YOU LIKE TO PET MY BUNNY RABBIT
ONE IS THE STRONG BLOCK WHERE YOU'RE DENYING THE REALITY OF WHAT SOMEONE'S TRYING TO SAY
MARSH FLITTER IS A VERY POWERFUL CARD IS OUT OF THE LORWYN BLOCK IS AN UNCOMMON IT IS A CREATURE FAERIE ROGUE
BUT THIS TIME ON TOP OF THE BLOCK THE BLOCK'S GOING TO BE REALLY HELPFUL
GIVE YOURSELF AN HOUR BLOCK AN HOUR OF TIME FIRST
NOT MUCH MORE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HOW MUCH YOU DO JUST BLOCK AN HOUR OF TIME SIT DOWN AND CHALLENGE YOURSELF TO CREATE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF STYLES BASED OFF OF ONE SILHOUETTE
WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL PUT THE EDGE OF THE BLOCK ON THE FLOOR AND WE'LL USE OUR BODY WEIGHT AND LAY ON THE BLOCK SUPPORTING YOURSELF WITH YOUR ARMS
YOU'LL JUST WANT TO BREATHE INTO THE BLOCK AND TAKE YOUR TIME TO RELAX INTO THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY LAYING OVER THE BLOCK
SO IF YOU PUNCH THAT SIDE I CAN BLOCK STILL I CAN BLOCK WITH THE RIGHT CHOP WITH THE LEFT
TO DEMONSTRATE THE TECHNIQUE AS I PUNCH BLOCK AND STEP IN CHOPPING AND INTO TH NECK JUST LIKE THAT
IF YOU PUNCH THE OTHER HAND I CAN BLOCK WITH THE RIGHT CHOP WITH THE LEFT
YOU WANT TO BRING THIS BLOCK TO ROUND AND CUT TWO SHOULDERS ON IT
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS TO DO IS GET A BLOCK OF WOOD MOUNTED INTO THE LATHE
LIKE I SAID ONCE YOU GET THESE 180S YOU CAN PROGRESS ON THE 360S WHICH IS TWO FULL SPINS FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY 540 WHICH IS ONE AND A HALF FULL SPINS SO ON AND SO FORTH AND THEN BASICALLY THIS 180 IS A STEPPING BLOCK TO EVERY OTHER SPIN
SO THIS WOULD ACTUALLY BE A LINE OR ROPE HERE INSTEAD OF THIS BLOCK OF WOOD
I STEP STRAIGHT BLOCK HENG QUAN
DRAW IN MY HANDS IN THE FIST DRAW MY LEFT FOOT IN BLOCK WITH MY LEFT FORM
I STEP STRAIGHT I BLOCK HENG QUAN
WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON TANTUI SERIES I THE TRANSITION TO RIGHT BACK FIST AND FINISH TANTUI I I'LL DEMONSTRATE IT FOR YOU AT NORMAL SPEED THEN I'LL HAVE MELISSA PERFORM IT FOR YOU SLOWED DOWN SO I CAN POINT OUT SOME OF THE FINER DETAILS PICKING IT UP FROM WHERE WE PERFORMED ROLLING BLOCK RIGHT TOE KICK
MY LEFT HAND PERFORMS A CIRCLE OVERHEAD PALM BLOCK
AS YOU EXHALE YOU'RE GOING TO BEND THE KNEES IF IT FEELS SAFE FOR YOUR KNEES AND COME ALL THE WAY ONTO THE BLOCK
THERE ARE THE BLOCK STYLE THAT ARE MORE LIKE CHALK THIS IS THE SAME THING ONLY ANOTHER VERSION WITH ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS COLORS
SO ONCE AGAIN SPEAR IN BLOCK STRAIGHT UP
BUT IF THEY ARE SPEARING STRAIGHT IN THIS ONE IS GOOD SO THEY SPEAR UP JUST BLOCK IT STRAIGHT UP THIS WAY AND FROM HERE YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT
THAT'S THE OVER THE OVER THE HEAD BLOCK AND STAFF
WE'RE GOING TO PLACE THIS BLOCK RIGHT BEHIND FAITH'S SPINE
THERE'S A SMALL AREA WHERE MY RETICLE LIGHTS UP TO SHOW ME THAT I CAN PLACE A PORTAL SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO THAT AND THEN I'LL PLACE ANOTHER ONE IN THIS ROOM AND STEP OUT AND THAT PUTS ME ON TOP OF THIS BLOCK DISPENSER
SO THE QUARTERBACK'S JOB IS JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ON THE REVERSE WHERE HE'LL FAKE THE PLAY CARRY OUT THE HAND OFF OF THE PLAY AND THEN HE'LL TRY TO GET INTO THE ACTION OF THE PLAY AND GET THE CHANCE TO THROW A BLOCK
THAT'S BEING PERFORMED OUTSIDE BLOCK HIGH CHOP
I CAN BLOCK WITH THE LEFT CHOP WITH THE RIGHT
THAT IS A REGULAR TAIL BLOCK I MEAN TAIL WHEELIE
THIS CARD HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE THE ONSLAUGHT BLOCK
TO BLOCK A USER WHO'S HARASSING YOU ON MYSPACE
HI MY NAME IS ERICA GAMS AND I'M HERE IN SALT LAKE CITY UT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MYSPACE ON THE INTERNET AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO BLOCK A USER THAT IS HARASSING YOU ON MYSPACE
FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU WANT TO BLOCK THEM GO AHEAD AND CLICK ON THEIR PROFILE AND THEN YOU CAN CLICK BLOCK
IN PLACING THINGS ON YOUR COFFEE TABLE YOU WANT TO BE SURE IF SOMEBODY IS SITTING HERE YOU DON'T WANT TO BLOCK THEIR VISION AND SO YOU WANT TO PUT SOMETHING ON YOUR TABLE THAT'S KIND OF LOW
IF YOU HAVE THE TIME TAKE YOUR BLOCK OF BUTTER OUT LEAVE IT OUT FOR ABOUT A HOUR
TO BEGIN THE COMBINATION I'LL STEP FORWARD TURN MY RIGHT FOOT OUT I'LL STEP FORWARD LEFT FOOT BACK STANCE LEFT HAND PALM BLOCK
THIS MEANS THAT I CAN PUT MY BLOCK OF WOOD IN EXACTLY THE SAME PLACE EVERY TIME I INK AND WANT TO PRINT
NOW THAT I HAVE FOUR CORNERS LAID OUT IN MY JIG I CAN REMOVE MY BLOCK OF WOOD AND FAIRLY EASILY PLACE IT BACK INTO MY JIG
SO NOW THAT I HAVE DONE THAT I'M ALSO GOING TO WANT TO MARK MY PAPER AND THIS PARTICULARLY BECOMES IMPORTANT IF YOU'RE PRINTING SEVERAL TIMES WITH EITHER THE SAME BLOCK OF WOOD OR IN SEPARATE BLOCKS OF WOOD
IT COMES IN A LARGER BLOCK FIVE TO TEN POUNDS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE'RE CUTTING IT THE BEST WAY TO CUT IT IS TO USE ANOTHER PIECE OF WIRE
SO YOU TAKE THE BALL YOU TAKE THE RACKET YOU OPEN THE FACE AND YOU JUST BLOCK IT AGAINST THE WALL AND THAT'S A FOREHAND VOLLEY RIGHT THERE
BUT THEN I HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL TO SAND THIS IS A SANDING BLOCK FOAM SANDING BLOCK THE ENDS OF THOSE TUBES
A LOT OF TIMES IN THE TIGHTER AREAS I'LL GET A SMALLER BLOCK
DON'T LET YOUR TOES LEAVE THE BLOCK
AS THEY ATTACK YOU'RE GOING TO BLOCK WITH THE LEFT AND DRIVE THE PALM TOWARD THE NECK
YOU USE THE BLOCK AND THE STRIKE ALMOST IN THE SAME TIME
I'M WES FROM THE CHINESE KUNG FU ACADEMY AND FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND THIS IS HOW YOU PERFORM THE MANTIS FIGHTING TECHNIQUE OUTSIDE BLOCK CHOP
HE'S GOING TO TIME IT JUST SO WHEN HE'S MAKING HIS REACTION HE'S GOING TO HINDER BLOCK DO WHATEVER HE'S GOT TO DO WITHIN THE LEGAL PARAMETERS OF THE GAME TO KEEP HIM FROM COMING DOWN AND MAKING A PLAY ANY CLOSER THAN HE POSSIBLY NEEDS TO
NOW WE'VE GONE OVER THE CRACK WHICH IS A GREAT BLOCK
YOU CAN SAY THAT PARTICULAR CREATURE CANNOT BLOCK THIS TURN AND IT CAN'T BLOCK DURING THIS TURN
FOR ONE AND A RED TARGET CREATURE CAN'T BLOCK THIS TURN
WE'LL STRETCH THE KNEES UP JUST LIKE WE DID ON THE BLOCK NOW THE BLOCK'S NOT THERE
GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT AROUND THE BLOCK TO VERIFY YOUR BALL JOINT REPLACEMENT
GOOD NOW ONE MORE DOING THIS SIDE CHAMBER SIDE STEP YES NOW CIRCLE BLOCK PUNCH
THIS IS A DODGING PALM PUNCH CHAMBER STAY THERE CHAMBER THIS NOW OPEN THIS HAND MELISSA TURN OVER NOW HERE STEP TO THE SIDE PALM BLOCK NOW STEP TOGETHER AND PUNCH
THE FIRST STEP IS MY DODGING STEP SO I GO DODGE PALM BLOCK
THIS IS HOW TO DODGING PALM BLOCK CAT STANCE PUNCH KUNG FU FOR HEALTH
SO WE CAN MAYBE PLACE A PORTAL ABOVE THAT ONE AND DROP A BLOCK ON IT IF WE CAN AIM THAT
SO ONE THING THAT WE CAN DO TO GET RID OF THEM INSTEAD OF RUSHING THEM WITH A BLOCK BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MANY OF THEM WE CAN PLACE A PORTAL UNDER THE DIFFERENT TURRETS AND LET THEM FALL THROUGH OR WE CAN PLACE ONE BEHIND AND WALK UP AND GRAB IT LIKE WE'VE BEEN DOING
THINK OF WHERE THE LIGHT IS HITTING IT AND BLOCK IN THE SHAPES
SO PLAYING CHORD VOICINGS IN THIS SEGMENT I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU DIFFERENT WAYS TO PLAY YOUR CHORDS AND SO YOU CAN SOUND A LITTLE BIT MORE PROFESSIONAL WITH YOUR PLAYING AS OPPOSE TO JUST JUMPING FROM BLOCK ROUTE POSITION CHORDS
THAT WILL ALLOW THE DEFENSE TO CREEP UP AND ADJUST AND THEN THE FULLBACK WILL GO THROUGH AND HELP BLOCK
THIS ONE IS CALLED OUR PALM BLOCK LUNGE PUNCH
WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN THIS ONE WITH OUR PALM BLOCK SO YOU'RE GOING TO BRING YOUR LEFT HAND OUT PALM BLOCK
