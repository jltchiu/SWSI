I CAN CONTROL THAT ANGLE BY MOVING MY WEIGHT FORWARD EVEN MORE FORWARD SO IT ANGLES THE OTHER DIRECTION
KITTIES DON'T LIKE ANYTHING THEY ARE NOT IN CONTROL OF
WE WANT A CONTROL BREAK

ALWAYS RACK THE BAR UNDER CONTROL
GOOD CONTROL MOTION
WHICH IS REALLY NOT THE OPTIMAL WAY TO DO CAUSE ONCE AGAIN ONCE YOU START TAKING IT TO MORE ADVANCE STAGES OF DOING 180S FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE GOING 180 DOWN SOME STAIRS OR YOU ARE GOING A 180 OVER A JUMP SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU HAVE A LOT LESS CONTROL OVER THE TRICK
WHICH IS BASICALLY THE FRONT END IF YOU GO TO BIT TORRENT.COM THAT'S PITTORRENT.COM/DOWNLOAD FROM HERE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE BIT TORRENT CLIENT THIS IS THE OFFICIAL BIT TORRENT CLIENT USE CAN USE THIS HOWEVER THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT CLIENTS YOU CAN USE IF YOU GO TO DESSEND.NET/BTFAQ THE SITE THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT IN THE LAST TUTORIAL SCROLL DOWN YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A PART IN THE FAQ CALLED WHERE CAN I DOWNLOAD THE BIT TORRENT PROGRAM AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CLIENTS DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOUR USING WINDOWS OR WHETHER YOU HAVE A MACK AND YOU'RE USING OSX THERE'S A GOOD DOZEN OR SO JUST STICK COMES DOWN PREFERENCE IF SAY IF YOUR USING SHAREAZA OR SOME OTHER PIER TO PIER SOFTWARE THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER YOU CAN ALSO USE THOSE TO DOWNLOAD TORRENTS WITH OR YOU CAN EVEN I'M IN OPERA RIGHT NOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY DOWNLOAD TORRENTS THROUGH OPERA AND I BELIEVE FIREFOX BUT THEY DON'T REALLY GIVE YOU THE CONTROL OF OVER THE TORRENTS AND THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION YOUR GOING TO KNOW WHAT ABOUT AND WHEN YOUR USING TORRENTS
BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IS BE ABLE TO PUT WEIGHT ON THE FRONT OF YOUR BOARD OR YOUR NOSE AND ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PURPOSEFULLY PICK UP THE BACK WHEELS AND CLEAR THE COPING AND BE ABLE TO ROLL BACK DOWN THE TRANSITION AND HAVE CONTROL

NOW WHAT I WANT TO DO NEXT IS I WANT TO TRY TO COPY SOME PATTERNS SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS GRAB MY CONTROL BUTTON AND HOLD DOWN CONTROL AND COPY THIS PATTERN F SO THIS PATTERN F NOW IS COPIED NOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS PLACE IT TO AN AVAILABLE PART OF OR PLACE IT OVER SOMETHING SO I'M GOING TO GO TO MY D SHARP ACTUALLY I'M GOING TO GO TO MY F SHARP AND PASTE IT RIGHT OVER IT
THIS WILL HELP YOU BE MORE IN CONTROL AND AS A RESULT HAVE MORE FUN WITH IT

IF YOU GET WRIST CONTROL HAND CONTROL
IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THE SMALLER HOME BLADE GRINDERS THAT YOU'RE USING TO GRIND YOUR COFFEE FOR YOUR ESPRESSO THEN ALL YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS PUT THE COFFEE IN THERE LIKE NORMAL AND WHEN YOU HIT THE BUTTON TO START GRINDING THE COFFEE THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU HAVE TO CONTROL HOW FINE YOU'RE GRINDING YOUR COFFEE IS BY THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT YOU GRIND THE COFFEE

KNEES WILL FOLLOW THE SAME DIRECTION OF THE TOES AS YOU LOWER YOURSELF DOWN UNDER GOOD CONTROL
FIRST WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW ACUPUNCTURE CAN HELP TO CONTROL OUR EATING
LIFTING THE BAR UP UNDER GOOD CONTROL STEPPING OUT GOOD FOOT STANCE MAKING SURE THE KNEES TRAVEL IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE TOES
BENDING AT THE KNEES LOWERING YOURSELF DOWN UNDER GOOD CONTROL
THE GRIP IS LESS IMPORTANT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE GOOD CONTROL OVER YOUR OPPONENT'S SHOULDERS
AND I'M GOING TO PRESS MY SHORTCUT KEY OF CONTROL PLUS K TO SHOW THAT IT RE-ENTERS IT
NOW WHAT I'M ACTUALLY DOING IS I'M SPINNING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE STICK GETTING AN OUTSIDE SPIN ON THE TASSEL KICKING MY LEG OVER AND LETTING THE STICK JUST ROLL OVER MY LEG LIKE THAT AND BACK OUT TO MY RIGHT CONTROL STICK JUST LIKE THAT

HOWEVER IF YOU DON'T BREAK PROPERLY AND SAY YOU SCRATCH ON THE BREAK OR YOU DON'T POCKET A BALL ALL YOU'RE DOING AT THAT POINT IS JUST TURNING CONTROL OVER THE TABLE TO YOUR OPPONENT
WE'RE FEELING DEFENSIVE OR WE WANT TO CONTROL WHAT'S GOING ON AND PUT OUR OWN IDEAS OUT THERE
