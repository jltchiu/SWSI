AND THE MOSQUITO GUARD SURVIVES WITHOUT TAKING THE FOUR DAMAGE THAT THE CRESTED CRAGHORN WOULD DEAL
IN THIS CASE THE MOSQUITO GUARD EVEN THOUGH IT IS ONLY A ONE ONE CAN DEFEAT THE CRESTED CRAGHORN BECAUSE ITS TOUGHNESS IS ONLY ONE
THE MOSQUITO GUARD WILL KILL THE CRESTED CRAGHORN BY DEALING ONE POINT OF FIRST STRIKE DAMAGE
AGAIN I'M IN MY GUARD
AS YOU SEE THERE'S A GUARD THAT IS CURLED WHICH CAN PROTECT YOUR HAND AND HELP YOU PARRING HELP YOU BLOCK YOUR OPPONENT'S ATTACKS
THAT WILL MAKE YOU A REALLY STRONG GUARD
THIS IS A UH LIFE JACKET SOMETHING THAT YOU WEAR AS A VEST YOU WANT TO GET ONE THAT'S COMFORTABLE THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOU IF YOU IF YOU FALL OUR OF YOUR BOAT OR YOU GO SWIMMING AND VIRTUALLY ALL OF THESE ARE COAST GUARD APPROVED SO THAT THE U.S COAST GUARD APPROVES THE VEST BASED ON THEIR DESIGN BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF FLOTATION THAT THEY HAVE IN THEM AND YOU'LL SEE THAT IN THE INSIDE OF THE BACK OF EVERY VEST THERE'S A COAST GUARD APPROVED INSIGNIA AND THAT WILL TELL YOU WHAT TYPE IT IS
LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW THE GUARD PULLS OUT VIDEO DEMO
WHEN THIS GUARD PULLS WE WANT HIM TO TAKE ONE STEP BACK
WE WANT TO FILL THE SPOT OF THE GUARD
ONE WHEN THIS GUARD PULLS OUT THAT WILL LEAVE A BIG HOLE ON THIS SIDE
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU PULL THE GUARD YOU HAVE A RUNNING BACK COMING THROUGH OR THAT THE TACKLE KNOWS THAT HE HAS TO COVER OR WE HAVE A TIGHT END CRACKING DOWN ETC
WHAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS WHEN YOU USE THE GUARD EFFECTIVELY AS A PULLING GUARD
WE MUST MAKE SURE OF A FEW THINGS WHEN WE PULL OUR GUARD
AND THAT INVOLVES A GUARD GENERALLY DRIBBLING AROUND THE TOP OF THE KEY AREA
WHAT THEY DO IS THEY GUARD PRISONERS THAT HAVE BEEN HOUSED ARRESTED OR JAILED BECAUSE OF FEDERAL OFFENSES
ANOTHER GOOD THING THAT WORKS REALLY WELL IS STATIC GUARD WHICH WE ALL KNOW FROM USING ON OUR SKIRTS WITH HOSE
SO JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU USE A CONDITIONER IN THE SHOWER AFTER YOU SHAMPOO SOMETHING LIGHT THAT DE-TANGLES AND IF IT'S REALLY BAD A LEAVE IN CONDITIONER BEFORE YOU STYLE AND THEN AGAIN YOU CAN TRY A STATIC GUARD HAIRSPRAY WATER
BUT YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE SURE YOU GET A ONE SHOT ONE KILL ON THIS FIRST WE KINDA HAVE WAY POINTS OR WHATEVER WITH CAPTAIN MCMILLAN HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH A FEW FEW LITTLE THINGS WITH TAKING DOWN SOME GUARD SOME GUARD POST AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT YOU'VE GOT YOU HAVE TO GET THE ONE SHOT ONE KILL TO BEGIN WITH HERE
HERE ON A CARD CALLED MOSQUITO GUARD YOU WILL SEE THAT IS SAYS FIRST STRIKE
AND THE SAME GOES FOR THE FOREHAND SIDE SO INSTEAD OF THIS ARM GUARD IT'S LIKE THAT
THIS IS KEY TURN THE GUARD TO MAKE THE PARRY
ALL PARRIES START IN THE FINGERS TURNING THE GUARD TO MAKE THE PARRY
THIS GUY RIGHT NOW HAS THE BALL SO HE HAS TO COMMIT TO HIM AND HE HAS TO GUARD HIM FULLY BUT AS QUICKLY AS THE BALL MOVES FROM THERE GO AHEAD AND MOVE IT TO THE TOP OF THE KEY
NOW DEPENDING ON HOW DEPENDING ON THE OFFENSE THAT THEY'RE PLAYING AND HOW EFFECTIVE THAT OFFENSE IS THAT WILL DETERMINE HOW FAR YOUR POINT GUARD WILL GO OUT
SO I SLIDE UP I KEEP MY HANDS ON MY GUARD
NOW THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO GUARD AGAINST THIS
COME BACK ON GUARD
WHEN YOU'RE SETTING UP A ONE THREE ONE FIRST OF ALL YOU WANT TO SET IT UP WHERE YOUR POINT GUARD IS AT THE TOP OF THE KEY AROUND THIS AREA
YOUR POINT GUARD MIGHT WANT TO COME DOWN AND BE INSIDE HERE
THE HANDS ARE IN WHAT'S CALLED A SPLIT GUARD POSITION
WITH THIS SETUP YOU WANT TO BE SURE TO HAVE A GUARD CLAMP BEHIND A STOP-CLAMP BEHIND THIS BOARD SO THAT WHEN THE BELT SANDER'S ON HERE IT DOESN'T JUST FLY OFF BECAUSE A BELT SANDER'S A VERY POWERFUL TOOL AND WILL THROW THIS PIECE AROUND BUT WE'VE GOT THIS STOP HERE AND THAT'S GOING TO KEEP THIS IN PLACE AS WELL AS LET THE BELT SANDER GO COMPLETELY AND COVER THE WHOLE AREA OF THE PIECE OF WOOD HERE
NOW YOU WANT TO SPEND SOME TIME ROLLING BACKWARDS AND GETTING COMFORTABLE IN THIS POSITION BECAUSE SINCE YOU DON'T ROLL BACKWARDS VERY OFTEN IT CAN SOMETIMES CATCH YOU OFF GUARD IF YOU HIT SOMETHING TO ROLL AND FALL DIRECTLY IN THE DIRECTION YOU'RE HEADED SO YOU'RE ROLLING BACKWARDS AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR FEET IN THE OLLIE POSITION
THERE'S A PLASTIC GUARD THAT KEEPS SOME OF THE BATTERY ACID OFF OF THE METAL TRAY
THAT CHAIN GUARD IS GORGEOUS
WHEN HE PULLS WE DON'T WANT THIS GUARD TO BE IN THE BACKFIELD BECAUSE WE MAY BE BRINGING A RUN RIGHT AHEAD OF HIM
WHEN A GUARD PULLS OUT HE HAS TO GO AT A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE
SO WE CAN USE HIM OUT ON THE WING AS AN OUTSIDE SHOOTER WHAT WE CALL THE SMALL FORWARD POSITION WHICH IS ACTUALLY LIKE ANOTHER BIG GUARD
BUT OUR FORWARDS ARE GOING TO BE THE BIG GUYS YOU WANT TO CONCENTRATE ON THE SMALL FORWARD BEING A BIG GUARD THAT CAN SHOOT
SOME OFFENSES RUN A THREE GUARD SET SO INSTEAD OF HAVING A SMALL FORWARD THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER GUARD
IT'S ALSO AN OPTION TO HAVE A STALL GUARD SO THAT YOUR HORSE IS ABLE TO STICK IT'S HEAD OUT AND THE VENTILATION IS IMPROVED
ON THE OTHER SIDE SAME THING WITH THE SHOOTING GUARD ANYTHING OVER THERE PAST THE POINT GUARD WILL BE THAT SHOOTING GUARDS RESPONSIBILITY
SO YOU'LL HAVE THE POINT GUARD UP TOP YOU'LL HAVE A FORWARD RIGHT HERE A CENTER WILL BE A LITTLE FURTHER BACK BUT WHAT YOU'LL HAVE IS YOU'LL HAVE A SMALL FORWARD HERE YOU'LL HAVE THE SHOOTING GUARD ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SUPPORT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEFENSE
NOW YOU MAY OR MAY NOT WANT THE OUTSIDE PLAYERS THE FORWARD AND THE SHOOTING GUARD TO MOVE UP A LITTLE BIT THAT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU WANT TO RUN IT
SO YOU'LL HAVE A SMALL FORWARD POWER FORWARD ALONG THE MIDDLE AND YOU'LL HAVE THE SHOOTING GUARD ON THE OTHER SIDE
IF YOU SEE INSIDE THE GUARD THERE IS PLUG TO WHICH THE WIRE PLUGS IN VERY NICELY ALLOWING THE ELECTRICAL BOX TO SCORE AND TO REGISTER WHO GETS THE HIT
IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE GUARD STAYS AT A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE RIGHT DOWN THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE
