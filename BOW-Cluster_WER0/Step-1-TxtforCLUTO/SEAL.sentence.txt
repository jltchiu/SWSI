WHEN YOU DO YOU DRIBBLE YOU KEEP THE BALL IN CLOSE TO YOU AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEAL YOUR DEFENDER AWAY AND KEEP YOUR SHIELD UP
ONCE YOU BREAK THE SEAL WITH YOUR PUTTY KNIFE OR FIVE IN ONE TOOL JUST GO AHEAD AND POP THAT ALL THE WAY AROUND THE CAN UNTIL THE TOP COMES ALL THE WAY OFF

WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SEAL THIS BACK UP
IF THERE'S ANY AIR SPACES IN THERE YOU CAN PUT A LITTLE FOAM IN THERE TO SEAL IT

WHAT THEY DO WHEN THEY ARE PAINTING WITH THE ROLLER IS THE TEMPTATION TO GO AND PAINT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TAPE LINE WHEN YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THE MORE PAINT YOU PUT ON THE TAPE YOU CREATE A SEAL SO THAT WHEN YOU PULL THE TAPE BACK YOU WIND UP PULLING THE PAINT AND MESSING UP A LOT OF GOOD WORK
