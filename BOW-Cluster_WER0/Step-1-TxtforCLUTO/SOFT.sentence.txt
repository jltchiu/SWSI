WE HOLD A LOT OF TENSION IN ALL THE SOFT TISSUES OF THE ORGANS AND SO IF YOU HAVE HARDNESS OR STIFFNESS OR A FEELING OF CONGESTION IN THIS PART OF THE BODY THIS HELPS TO JUST SOFTEN THAT AREA WHETHER YOU NEED HELP WITH DIGESTION OR ELIMINATION OR YOU JUST NEED TO RELAX THERE
THE AMERICAN WOODCOCK FOR EXAMPLE IS A BIRD THAT WHEN IT TAKES OFF IT HAS THIS SORT OF SOFT TWITTERING SOUND WHICH IS ACTUALLY MADE BY AIR PASSING THROUGH THE OUTER FLIGHT FEATHERS
A DOG WITH ELBOW DYSPLASIA DOESN'T LIKE THIS MASSAGE TO START WITH IN WHICH CASE YOU WANT WITH JUST SOME SOFT GENTLE MOVEMENT JUST MOVE YOUR HANDS OVER THE SKIN DON'T PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON IT AND GRADUALLY WORK YOUR WAY UP
