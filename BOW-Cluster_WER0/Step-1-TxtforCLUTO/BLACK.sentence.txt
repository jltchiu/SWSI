NOW THE BACKGROUND IS ONLY TWO LAYERS AND THIS BLACK BACK THAT I HAVE IS THE ONLY LAYER THAT I WON'T IMPORT INTO FLASH
IT'S THE ONLY WOOD THAT IS A NATURAL BLACK COLOR
IT'S ACTUALLY BLACK
ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS I WAS ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT HER AS A PUPPY BECAUSE BLACK LABS ESPECIALLY ANY KIND OF HUNTING BREED LOVES TO CHEW LOVES TO GET IN AND DIG AND CHEW ON STUFF
YOU CAN DO SUNGLASSES HAND SANITIZER ALSO IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE BLACK BOOK IT'S A GREAT WAY TO LAUGH AND SEE WHAT LADY CARRIES A LITTLE BLACK BOOK AND THAT'S A TWENTY POINT ITEM OR FIFTEEN POINT ITEM EXCUSE ME
SOMETIMES EVERYONE'S IN PINK OR EVERYONE'S IN BLACK AND SOMETIMES THE GIRLS GET TOGETHER AND EMBELLISH THEIR T-SHIRT WITH SOME LITTLE SLOGANS OR MAYBE SOME RHINESTONES ON THEM
USUALLY COLORED BELTS OR BLACK BELTS THEY'RE TRYING OUT THE SUSPENDED BOARD BREAK
SO NOT ONLY DO I LIKE IT BECAUSE OF ITS HOT STEAMINESS BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT'S QUITE FASHIONABLE IF YOU ASK ME THE PURPLE AND BLACK I LOVE IT
AND YOU WANT TO PRESS DOWN HARD ENOUGH WHERE YOU CAN SEE THAT BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO SEE YOUR PEN-WRITING ON THE BLACK FELT
IF YOU SEE ANY BROWN OR BLACK IN THERE YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND CLEAN THEM OUT
REMEMBER TO ROLL IT AROUND YOUR BODY SO YOU DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP AND TURN BLACK AND BLUE ALL RIGHT
ONE IS THE BLACK VERSION WHICH IS WHAT THIS ONE IS AND THEN ALSO HAVE A SILVER VERSION OF IT
THIS PART HERE IS A SUNSHADE AND THIS DOESN'T COME WITH THE CAMERA BUT YOU CAN GET THIS AT RADIO SHACK AND IT COMES IN SILVER ONLY AT RADIO SHACK SO I SPRAY PAINTED IT BLACK
NOTICE AS WE MOVE THAT WE ARE MAINTAINING GOOD FOOTWORK THAT AT ALL TIMES OUR LEGS ARE UNDERNEATH US AND WE'RE GOING PRETTY DIAGONAL AND PERPENDICULAR AND IN STRAIGHT LINES BUT AS YOU DO THE DRILL IN CLASS YOU ARE MOVING YOU'RE PROBING THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO START ANY CLASS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT IS BLACK BELT OR WHITE BELT BECAUSE YOU WANT YOUR STUDENTS TO REALLY GET THEIR LEGS WARMED UP GETTING THEIR MINDS SET GETTING THAT SENSE OF DISTANCE AND ALIGNMENT SO THAT IT BECOMES INSTINCTIVE TO THEM
FOR CAREERS SPECIFICALLY THE COLOR WOULD BE BLACK AND WE ALSO TALK ABOUT WATER IN THIS AREA AS WELL FOR FLOW
NOT QUITE AS EFFICIENT AS THE AS A STANDARD WITH THE BLACK ON THE BACK BUT THEY WORK REALLY GOOD
IT'S VERY SIMPLE THIS DRAWING IS ABOUT LINE AND IT'S ABOUT BLACK AND WHITE THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT
COMPARED TO THAT WE'VE GOT THIS USE OF LINE WHERE HE'S ACTUALLY USING A WHITE LINE ON BLACK INSTEAD OF BLACK ON WHITE AND THIS IS A VERY SORT OF FREE WHAT WE WOULD CALL IT A SORT OF A CALLIGRAPHIC LINE VERY CURVY AND VERY FREE
THE BLACK GOES A LONG WAY
I'M MIKE LOPEZ WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING THE BLACK COLOR FROM MAGIC THE GATHERING
IF I CLICK CHANGE IT'S GOING TO MAKE THAT BLACK
ALRIGHT WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING ON OUR BLACK HAWK

WHICHEVER PROJECT THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON AND WHAT IT INQUIRES AND IT WILL TURN IT TO THE COLOR OF PATINA THAT YOU HAVE SELECTED WHETHER IT BE BLACK BROWN OR GREEN
WE PUT ON OUR TOPPINGS THAT CONSISTED OF BLACK OLIVES SOME FRESH TOMATOES SOME MUSHROOMS AND WE USED A SMOKED MOZZARELLA
THE BLACK TO THE BLUE WIRE NUTS AGAIN PLACED ON
YOU COULD CERTAINLY USE BLACK PEPPER IF YOU NEEDED TO AND WE HAVE SALT
I THINK I MENTIONED BEFORE WHEN YOU HAVE DARK LEVELS OF BLACK AND GRAYS IT MAKES THE CAMERA WORK HARDER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT'S SEEING
BLACK TO DO THE NOSE AND RED TO DO THE LITTLE TONGUE
DARK BLACK ESPECIALLY KIND OF DULLS COLORS
THIS IS DARK AS MUCH BLACK HAS I CAN GET IT AND STILL SAY THAT IT'S RED
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A METALLIC SMOKY BLACK
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING ALL BLACK ALL THE TIME BUT BECAUSE OF THIS PURPOSE WE'RE TRYING TO SHOW YOU GUYS HOW TO DO SOMETHING QUICK AND IT'S A GREAT WAY OF DOING IT
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF BLACK WILL GIVE IT MORE-MAYBE A LITTLE BLUE ALSO MORE OF THAT PEAR COLOR
ALL DIFFERENT DESIGNS IF WE'RE GOING IN A BLACK AND WHITE MOTIF THIS IS GREAT A MUSICAL MOTIF
THE RUNS GO FROM GREEN AS THE EASIEST TO BLUE BLACK AND DOUBLE BLACK DIAMOND BEING THE HARDEST
MY NAME IS CALAB LABARDA I'M A THIRD DEGREE BLACK BELT IN TAEKWONDO
YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO NEED YOUR BLACK STRIPING BRUSH AND YOU'RE GOING TO NEED YOUR SMALLEST SIZE DOTTER
BLACK IS FAVORED BUT PEOPLE ALSO USE A MANIC PANIC DYE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO HAVE A BRIGHT BLUE STREAK OR A BRIGHT RED STREAK
DARK BLACK IS KIND OF NICE FOR THAT ESPECIALLY FOR AN EVENING BECAUSE YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE DOING THIS FOR A SPECIAL PARTY OR FUNCTION OR MAYBE EVEN FOR HALLOWEEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT COMING UP FOR PARTIES OR THE CHRISTMAS PARTIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
BLACK DIAMOND MAKES SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF HARNESSES
AND THIS HAS BEEN ABOUT BLACK DIAMOND HARNESSES
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS JUST HOLD THAT OVER THE CAMERA WHEN YOU'RE SHOOTING AND YOU'RE BEHIND THAT AND IT'S REALLY ONLY GOING TO SHOW THE THE FRONT END OF THE LENS AND MINIMIZE ANY BLACK SPOTS ON THE REFLECTION
WE THEN MADE A SAUCE USING SOME GROUND BEEF TOMATO SAUCE SOME SEASONINGS SOME OREGANO BASIL ONION POWDER GARLIC SALT BLACK PEPPER
NOW I AM USING THE BLACK STRING LICORICE AGAIN BECAUSE I LIKE THE SHAPE FOR THE EYES AND JUST CUT SOME LITTLE BITS
THIS IS A POSTER WITH THE BLACK FOAM CORE
AND START TO SEE START TO SEE THE WHITE AND BLACK PATTERNS
IT'S AS IMPORTANT TO SEE THAT WHITE SHAPE THAT'S CARVED OUT BY THE BLACK MARKS AS IT IS TO SEE THE BLACK MARKS
MY LOGO AS A PROFESSIONAL CALLIGRAPHER IS A ZEBRA AND THE REASON I CHOSE A ZEBRA IS BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP OF BLACK AND WHITE AND THE NEGATIVE SPACE
INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL TWO TO EVEN FIVE FOOT TALL PUPPETS ARE MANIPULATED BY TWO ONE TWO OR THREE PERFORMERS DRESSED IN BLACK AND VISIBLE OVERTLY ON THE STAGE
THE NEXT STEP IS TO DETERMINE THE NAIL LENGTH AND SOME NAILS ARE BLACK SOME NAILS ARE CLEAR WHICH MAKES IT A LITTLE EASIER TO IDENTIFY THE QUICK OR THE RED PART INSIDE THE NAIL
NOW THAT THE CREASE IS DONE WE'RE GOING TO ADD SOME MORE BLACK
A GOOD LINER TO USE WITH THIS IS A BLACK SOFT COAL LINER
WE'RE GOING TO USE A BLACK EYELINER
SO NOW WE WILL GO AHEAD GET THE RED COW TO THE WHITE FACE AND LEAVE THE BLACK AND THE WHITE
NOW THE BIGGEST MOST POPULAR THING IN PUNK JEWELERY IS HEAVY SILVER AND BLACK JEWELERY
YOU CAN ALSO SEE IT'S A BLACK LEATHER CUFF AND SILVER JEWELERY
IT'S ALL SILVER AND BLACK TO SORT OF GO WITH THE METAL AND HARDWARE OF SOME OTHER THINGS
AGAIN SOME BLACK PEPPER A COUPLE OF TIMES AROUND YOU KNOW A HALF A TEASPOON AND WE ARE JUST GOING TO FOLD ALL OF THAT IN
BASALT THESE BLACK STONES HERE
SO I'M GIVE A LITTLE BLACK CIRCLES INSIDE THE BLUE CIRCLES DRAW ON SOME EYEBROWS AND SOME EYELASHES AND A COUPLE LITTLE MARKS ON THE BEAK THERE AND THAT CREATES THE FACE OF THE DUCK RIGHT THERE
I'M GOING TO DO SOME SIMPLE BASIC CIRCLES HERE AND THEN I'M GOING TO PULL OUT MY BLACK SHARPIE AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS ACTUALLY GIVE THE PUPILS IN THE EYES AND THAT GIVES A LITTLE MORE REALITY TO IT
LET'S CHANGE THE BLUE AND SLIDE IT OVER AND GET A LITTLE BIT MORE BLACK IN THERE LOOK AT THAT
SO HERE AGAIN WE'RE BACK TO OUR VERY BASIC BLACK
AND NOW YOU'LL SEE THAT EVERYWHERE ALONG YOUR ROUTE THAT'S ACCEPTING THIS PARTICULAR GOOD WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED IN THIS BLACK ARROW
THIS IS ALL OPTIONAL STUFF HERE AND BECAUSE I LIKE BLACK PEPPER A LOT I'M GOING TO PEPPER THE OUTSIDE OF IT TOO
YOU NOTE THAT ONCE THE COLORS GETS INVOLVED INSTEAD OF BLACK AND WHITE DICE WE HAVE COLORS
THAT SORT OF FILLS IN BREAKS UP SOME OF THE BLACK
JUST A LITTLE BLACK AND GOLD DROP
YOU COULD TAKE YOUR BOBBY PINS WHICH COME IN BROWN BLACK DEPENDING ON THE COLOR OF YOUR HAIR
THAT SPECIFIC TYPE OF BLACK TEA IS VERY VERY BROKEN UP AND IT'S SMALL LITTLE PELLETS MAINLY IT'S USED IN TEA BAGS THAT TYPE OF TEA YOU DON'T REALLY SHOULD CARE ABOUT GRADING
AND THE INDIAN BLACK TEAS ARE GRADED BY THEIR LEAF SIZE AS WELL AS THERE'S A STYLE CALLED A CTC IS CUT TEAR AND CURL
THE CHINESE BLACK TEA IS MAINLY GRADED IN LEAF SIZE AND ALSO WHERE WHERE IT'S PRODUCED AND WHAT PART OF THE PICKING WAS MADE WHEN IT WAS PICKED
SO HOW ARE DIFFERENT BLACK TEAS GRADED
IT WAS THAT BLACK LIQUID EYELINER AND THAT BLACK MASCARA
I'M MIKE LOPEZ WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING THE BLACK COLOR FROM MAGIC THE GATHERING
NOW IN THIS CASE THIS CREATURE HAS FLYING MEANS IT CAN ONLY BE BLOCKED BY CREATURES WITH FLYING AND/OR REACH AND IT ALSO HAS WHEN MARSH FLITTER COMES INTO THE PLAY PUT TWO 1/1 BLACK GOBLIN ROGUE CREATURE TOKENS INTO PLAY
THREE AND A BLACK TO PLAY AND YOU'RE PLAYING A 1/1
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TELL WITH BLACK BECAUSE YOUR PAINT BRUSH BEING BLACK IT IS HARDER TO TELL HOW MUCH PAINT YOU'VE GOT ON THERE
YOU COULD USE A BLACK OR EVEN A WHITE THREAD
SO FOR OUR SEASONINGS WE'RE GOING TO USE A LITTLE BLACK PEPPER SOME GARLIC POWDER SOME CREO SEASONINGS ONION POWDER SOME GARLIC SALT THESE ITEMS RIGHT HERE WE'LL BASICALLY USE WITH THE CHICKEN ALONG WITH SOME FLOUR TO DREDGE THEM IN AS WELL AS A CUP OF OIL TO FRY THEM IN
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR CLIMBING HARNESS FROM BLACK DIAMOND FITS PROPERLY
BLACK DIAMOND IS A CORPORATION THAT MAKES CLIMBING EQUIPMENT
SPECIFICALLY THE BLACK DIAMOND HARNESS
OR EVEN JUST A SIMPLE BLACK
TO BEGIN WITH THE STABILITY ON THE BOSU WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN AND YOU ARE GOING TO BRING THE BLACK SIDE TO THE TOP AND THE BALL PART IS GOING TO BE ON THE BOTTOM AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO PUT MY FEET ON HERE IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT O'KAY AND YOU MIGHT BE A LITTLE NERVOUS BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO BRING BOTH OF YOUR FEET ON TOP OF THE BALL AND IT LOOKS JUST LIKE THAT
THE REST OF THE CLEANING GOBY IS BLACK OVER MOST OF ITS BODY ALTHOUGH THE BELLY IS LIGHT COLORED WHITE OR WHITISH BLUE
IN THE OLDEN DAYS THAT'S ALL STUDENTS REALLY HAD WAS ONE NOTEBOOK AND A PENCIL AND A BLACK BOARD AND THEY LEARNED OFTEN MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN CHILDREN LEARN TODAY BUT IF YOU WANT TO WORK WITH THE FOLDERS AND WORKSHEETS IT'S AS ADVANCED AS COMPLEX AS YOU WANT TO MAKE IT OR AS SIMPLE AS YOU WANT TO MAKE IT
BLACK MASCARA AND BLACK EYELINER LIQUID EYELINER
YOU CAN BUY THIS ON THE INTERNET AND CAMERA STORES THAT'S MOLDED OUT OF BLACK PLASTIC BUT IT'S ABOUT TWENTY DOLLARS
I WOULD SAY LET US QUESTION THE AUTHORITY OF ANY PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT SHOW AN ALPHABET OVER THE BLACK BOARD THAT FOLLOWS ALONG WITH THESE PRINCIPLES BECAUSE IT'S ONLY WITH THESE PRINCIPLES THAT WHAT YOU HAVE IS A HOLISTIC FORM
NOW MATT GO AHEAD AND PULL BACK JUST A LITTLE BIT ANTHONY THERE JUST A PERSPECTIVE JUST TAKE IT IN SO WE CAN'T SEE THE BLACK
I AM HERE TO TALK ABOUT OKINAWAN KENPO KARATE I AM A SECOND DEGREE BLACK BELT FROM HONOLULU HI THAT IS WHERE I GOT ALL MY TRAINING
AND I'M USING A BLACK TOWEL THAT'S NOT GOOD EITHER
SO LIKE YOU CAN SEE HERE I HAD TO PUT THE BLACK DOWN FIRST AND THEN I PUT THE COLORS BACKWARDS AND VICE VERSA
SO WE'RE GOING TO PUT JUST A TOUCH OF BLACK IN THERE
WE'RE GOING TO BE A BLACK CAT ON HALLOWEEN SO DEFINITELY GET YOURSELF SOME BLACK SOCKS
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LEAVES AREN'T TURNING YELLOW OR ANY BLACK SPOTS ON THEM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
AND ALL YOU DO IS TAKE YOUR RED AND YOU START ADDING BLACK TO IT
AND BLACK CAN CHANGE THINGS REALLY REALLY FAST
I MEAN THE FIRST THING EVERYBODY DOES IS GO OH I GOT TO HAVE A DARK COLOR I'LL ADD BLACK
SO FOR EXAMPLE BLACK JACK ON RED QUEEN
WE ARE GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE BLACK AND THE GOLD ACCENTS BLACK WITH GOLD ACCENTS
SO IF YOU WANTED TO YOU COULD GO AHEAD AND SELECT LET'S SAY RED BECAUSE WE'RE SHOOTING SOME BLACK AND WHITE PORTRAITS OF PEOPLE WITH SAY THEY HAD SOME LIPSTICK ON
THIS DECK IS TWENTY YEARS OLD IT HAS HAD A SOLID STAIN ON IT MANY TIMES WE'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE COLOR WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THIS BLACK WE'RE GOING TO REPLACE THE BOARDS THAT NEED TO BE REPLACED WHEN WE DO THAT WE'LL HAVE NEW WOOD
BLACK WIRE IS KIND OF HARD TO FIND
THE TYPES OF WIRE THAT I USE FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT I USE A BLACK MATTE WIRE THAT I JUST GOT FROM THE HARDWARE STORE
BLUE BERRIES AND BLACK BERRIES AND RASPBERRIES AND CHERRIES
IT'S GOOD BLACK DIRT
AND THEN THIS IS MORE OF A MOOD LIGHT WITH A BLACK SHADE
IT REALLY CREATES MOOD AND GIVES YOU A NICE LITTLE LIGHT UNDER THE BLACK SHADE
AND THIS WILL DRY A LOT QUICKER THAN THE BLACK
THAT WAY THE COLOR IS NOT JUST ALL ONE BLACK COLOR YOU KIND OF GET A LITTLE BIT OF VARIANCES IN IT
AND AS I GET CLOSER I SEE SOME BLACK HANDPRINTS AND IF I LOOK UP I SEE THAT THERE ARE SOME OTHER PLACES FOR ME TO GO UP HERE
WE HAVE CUMIN BUTTER SALT BLACK PEPPER EGGS OF COURSE FOR THE OMELET LETTUCE AND FRESH CILANTRO
ALSO YOU CAN WEAR THE BASIC BLACK DRESS WITH LIKE SLIPPERS LIKE REALLY CUTE AND NICE SLIPPERS THAT YOU CAN WEAR IT WITH
WE ALL KNOW THAT THE EASIEST THING TO ACCESSORIZE OR NOT IS A BLACK DRESS
IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO ACCESSORIZE A BLACK DRESS
YOU CAN GET THESE BLACK SOCKS IN MOST CONVENIENT STORES
FIRST OFF YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOME BLACK SOCKS SOME GOOD OLD BASIC BLACK SOCKS
IT IS UNCOMMON FROM THE BASIC SET WHICH MEANS THAT IT WILL COST YOU FORTY TO FIFTY CENTS AT YOUR LOCAL GAMING STORE FROM THE 10TH EDITION AND RAIN OF TEARS COST YOU ONE AND TWO BLACK TO PLAY SO COSTS YOU THREE TO PLAY
I'M MIKE LOPEZ WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING THE BLACK COLOR FROM MAGIC THE GATHERING
YOUR RED BLACK DECK
I WOULD ALSO STAND CLEAR OF BLACK TOP BECAUSE IT'S TOO PITTY BUT ONCE YOU HAVE THOSE THINGS SQUARED AWAY YOU'RE READY TO START BOUNCE JUGGLING
PLAGUE WIND COST YOU SEVEN AND TWO BLACK PLAGUE WIND COST YOU NINE TO PLAY WHICH MEANS YOU CAN PLAY THIS CARD ON TURN NINE OR IF YOU HAVE MANY CAPABILITIES YOU CAN PLAY THIS CARD A LITTLE SOONER BUT WHAT THIS CARD DOES IT DESTROYS ALL CREATURES YOU DON'T CONTROL
YOU REALLY WANT TO LOOK FOR A SHOE THAT DOES NOT HAVE A BLACK SOLE
THIS IS CREATURE SPECIFIC FOR COLOR WHICH MEANS YOU WOULD PUT THIS IN YOUR SIDEBOARD TO YOUR MAIN DECK AND IF YOU RUN ACROSS SOMEONE WHO IS RUNNING HEAVY GREEN OR WHITE CREATURES THEN YOU WOULD PLACE THIS CARD IN THERE AND BASICALLY YOU'RE GETTING A FREE TEAR BECAUSE TEAR COST YOU ONE AND A BLACK AND THIS ONLY COST YOU A BLACK TO DESTROY TARGET GREEN OR WHITE CREATURE
IT COSTS YOU EIGHT BLACK TO PLAY AND WHAT THIS DOES IS THAT IT DESTROYS TARGET GREEN OR WHITE CREATURE
SO NOTICE I DO F MAJOR G C AND THAT I USE A LOT OF BLACK NOTES BECAUSE IT IS IN D FLAT MAJOR
NOW WE ARE GOING TO RUN THROUGH WITH SOME CHORDS AND DO SOME IMPROVISING SO I'M JUST GOING TO PLAY BASIC BLACK CHORDS
BLACK CHORDS IS WHEN YOU PLAY ONE THREE FIVE AND SEVEN IN A CHORD AND IT COULD BE ANY CHORD AND HERE IS ONE THREE FIVE AND F I CAN PLAY HERE AND HERE HERE HERE JUST AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THOSE BASIC CHORDS IN THERE
NORMALLY IT COSTS ONE COLORLESS AND TWO BLUE BUT WITH THE KICKER COSTS OF TWO COLORLESS AND ONE BLACK THE TOTAL COST BECOMES SIX TWO BLUE ONE BLACK AND THREE COLORLESS
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PIANO YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR THE GROUPS OF THE BLACK KEYS FIRST
THAT'S WHERE THOSE ROUND CIRCLE IN THE BLACK THAT WE CUT OUT ARE GOING TO COME INTO PLAY
THEN OUR BLACK BEANS WOULD BE DONE IT SAVES LOTS AND LOTS OF TIME
SO IF YOU HAVE A BLACK DRESS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO LIKE A BLACK NAIL POLISH OR DEEP RED YOU'RE GOING TO PROBABLY DO SOMETHING THAT'S NEUTRAL
SO THOSE ARE TWO REALLY EASY ONES THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS REMEMBER BLACK IS JUST 0'S AND WHITE IS JUST F'S
AND IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE SIX DIGITS AND IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE NUMBERS AND- AND IT COULD BE ALL NUMBERS LIKE BLACK IS 0000 BUT WHITE ON THE OTHER HAND IS FFFFF F OR WHATEVER SIX F'S
YOU WANT THEM TO HAVE A GOOD BLACK DIRT SO THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE NUTRIENTS THEY NEED
NOW ONCE AGAIN THE LORWYN SET IS TRYING TO SPECIFICALLY BUILD UP THE CREATURE TYPES OF FAERIES AND MERFOLK AND COSTS YOU THREE AND A BLACK TO PLAY
I'M MIKE LOPEZ WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING THE BLACK COLOR FROM MAGIC THE GATHERING
BUT AGAIN THIS IS GOING TO BE INSIDE OUT SO BECAUSE I'M USING A VERY LIGHT COLOR FOR THE BACKING A BLACK THREAD MIGHT SHOW
IF YOU'RE USING A BLACK FABRIC FOR THE BACK IT REALLY ALMOST DOESN'T MATTER WHAT COLOR THREAD YOU USE
I GO A HEAD GET MY PAINT BRUSH WET GET MY BLACK I DO LIKE THE BLACK TO DO A PALM TREE JUST BECAUSE IT REALLY HAS A NICE CONTRAST WITH THE OTHER COLORS THAT I'M DOING
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE A STIFF BRUSH AND I'M JUST GOING TO USE A LITTLE BIT OF BLACK HERE CAUSE I WANT THE OUTLINE OF THE TREE TO BE BLACK SINCE THE FRAME IS BLACK AND THE BORDER IS WHITE
I'M GOING TO USE BLACK TEA BECAUSE SO MANY OF YOU OUT THERE DRINK BLACK TEA
WITH BLACK TEA YOU SHOULD NOT LET IT BREW FOR TOO LONG WE'RE SO USED TO TEABAGS BECAUSE WITH TEABAGS YOU CAN LET IT SIT FOR AN HOUR TWO HOURS FOR THE WHOLE DAY AND YOU'LL GET A STRONG CUP BUT IT BASICALLY WILL TASTE THE SAME
SO FOR SOCKS I GENERALLY RECOMMEND A GRAY AND BLACK SHADES TO HAVE THERE
SUCH AS HAVING THIS IN BLACK AND GRAYS OR ALSO BROWNS
THERE'S A BLACK A BROWN A GREEN
WERE GOING TO BE USING THE BLACK
WHAT THE PATINA DOES IS ITS TAKES YOUR SILVER SAUDER COLOR THAT YOU HAVE AND IT WILL TURN IT TO A NICE BLACK COLOR LIKE IN THIS
SOMETIMES THE BLACK ALSO AND THEN IT'S STAINED
THIS IS WHERE THE MUSIC COMES FROM THE BLACK KEYS OR THE WHITE KEYS
WHEN WE DO WE'RE GOING TO CHECK THE BACK TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO BLACK LINE IF THERE IS JUST GO AHEAD AND RUN YOUR FINGER DOWN AND REMOVE IT
OF COURSE YOU CAN TRY IT WITH A SWEATER ON TOP DIFFERENT COLOR SWEATERS AND IF YOU LIVE IN A COLDER CLIMATE YOU CAN TRY A TRENCH COAT JUST ABOVE YOU KNOW JUST ON TOP OF THE BLACK DRESS
I'M GOING TO APPLY IT RIGHT HERE ABOVE THE BLACK IT BLENDS INTO ALMOST A LITTLE BIT OF SILVER THERE
WE ARE USING OUR SEASONING MIXTURE WITH THE GARLIC SALT THE GARLIC POWDER THE BLACK PEPPER THE ONION POWDER THOSE CREOLE SEASONINGS AND LIKE I SAID YOU CAN PICK THAT UP AT ANY GROCERY STORE THESE DAYS
OUR OVERALL COSTUME IS GOING TO BE BLACK
IT DOES HAVE SLIVER SO YOU MIGHT BE THINKING OH IT HAS SILVER HARDWARE MATCHES THE HARDWARE IN THE SHOES THAT MAY BE TRUE BUT THE OVERALL BULKINESS OF THE BAG THE SIZE OF THE BAG THE FACT THAT IT IS BLUE AND I'M WEARING BLACK AND PINK IT JUST IT OFF SETS THE OUTFIT IN A BAD WAY
LIKE I SAID AS MUCH BLACK AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY GET AROUND YOUR EYE
YOU CAN DO BLACK BEANS
BUT AS I PUT IT DOWN THERE THE PICTURE KIND OF FADES AWAY A LITTLE BIT COMPARED TO PUTTING THIS BLACK ONE ON IT IT STARTED TO BRING THE BLACKS BACK UP
THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT COLORS OF BLACK AND AS YOU PUT THEM DOWN ON IT YOU WILL LOOK AND SEE WHAT YOU LIKE BETTER THAT'S TOO SHINY
THEY ARE EITHER BLACK AND BLOND WOOD OR A NATURAL BROWN WOOD AND A NATURAL BLOND WHITE WOOD
THEY'RE A PRODUCT OF THE BLACK FOREST IN GERMANY
SO YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR PIECE OF BLACK FELT AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO WANT TO FOLD IT IN HALF MEET YOUR ENDS UP
NOW I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT ON THIS PIECE BECAUSE IT'S SOMEONE ELSE'S PIECE THAT THEIR WORKING ON BUT IT WOULD TURN THIS BLACK AND AS YOU GO AHEAD A PLACE YOUR PATINA UPON YOUR SAUDER YOU WOULD ALSO HAVE A DRYER AVAILABLE WHICH YOU WOULD HEAT UP THE PATINA ON YOUR SAUDER OR YOUR ZINC OR YOUR LEAD WHICHEVER YOU'RE USING IT ON
REMEMBER HOW WE SPOKE ABOUT IF THERE'S A LITTLE BLACK ARROW IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER WHICH THERE IS ON THE PEN TOOL
YOU'RE GOING TO PLACE THE PLATED SIDE WE'LL HEAR IT IT'S IN BLACK
YOU COULD ALSO USE BLACK PEPPER IF YOU WANTED
THE REASON WE USE WHITE PEPPER IS SO YOU DON'T HAVE BLACK SPECS IN YOUR SAUCE AND IT HAS BETTER EYE APPEAL
AND NOW I'M GOING TO DISCUSS DEATHMARK DEATHMARK IS A POWERFUL CARD POWERFUL SORCERY OUT OF THE BLACK COLOR FROM THE COLDSNAP EXPANSION
THE COLORIZATION OF THE LONGFIN DAMSELFISH IS A DARK BROWN TO BLACK OVER ITS ENTIRE BODY AND FINS
WHEN YOUR PRINTING COLOR OR IN BLACK AND WHITE
ANY TYPE OF GENERAL BLACK SHOES WILL DO
