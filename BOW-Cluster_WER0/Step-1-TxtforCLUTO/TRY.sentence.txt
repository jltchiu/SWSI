LET'S TRY THAT OUT
IF YOU GET STUCK IN A RIP CURRENT THE BEST THING I CAN DO IS YELL FOR HELP WHICH IS HELP OR JUST SIT THERE AND DRIFT OUT OF THE RIP CURRENT AND THEN TRY TO SWIM TO THE BEACH
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF GETTING KIND OF LIGHTHEADED OR DIZZY JUST STOP FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND GO BACK AND TRY IT AGAIN
SO I'M MIXING A LITTLE BIT OF THIS RED AND YELLOW TOGETHER TO TRY TO GET SOME SUNSET COLORS
WE'LL TRY THE OTHER SIDE JUST SO THAT WE'RE SURE THAT WE WERE CLEAR IN OUR DEMONSTRATION
TRY AND KEEP EVERYTHING TOGETHER
THEN WE EACH TRY TO MAKE TWO
TRY TAKING ONE BREATH AT EACH LEVEL
AS I'M MAKING THESE BOOKS I TRY NOT TO MAKE THE PICTURE TOO OBVIOUS THAT THEY CAN JUST GUESS BY LOOKING AT THE PICTURES
TODAY WE'LL TRY TO BREAK A BOARD
WE KNOW THAT IF YOU MAKE A LEGAL SHOT YOU GET TO SCORE AGAIN AND CONTINUE TO KEEP PLAYING SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A SCENARIO WHERE I'M STRIPES AND THERE'S TWO BALLS AND I'M STILL SHOOTING I COULD SO SOMETHING WHERE I CALL THE TWELVE BALL IN THE CORNER AND TRY TO STOP THE Q BALL HERE BECAUSE AGAIN AS YOU LEARN POOL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN POSITIONING AND AGAIN THIS IS A DIFFERENT VIDEO WE'RE JUST LEARNING ABOUT THE STRATEGY OF THE GAME AND TRYING TO WIN THE GAME BUT I WOULD TRY TO MAKE THE TWELVE THE TEN AND NOW ALL MY BALLS ARE DONE
LET'S TRY THAT ONE MORE TIME WITH THE DRUMS
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRY THEM OUT
ONE THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TRY TO BORROW THINGS THAT YOU CAN RETURN OR BUY CHEAP THINGS FROM THRIFT SHOPS AND REDONATE THEM TO THRIFT SHOPS SO THAT YOU DON'T BUILD UP A HUGE INVENTORY OF THINGS
TRY AND STAY AWAY FROM THAT
TRY NOT TO HAVE THEM ON THE FLOOR BECAUSE IF THEY'RE ON THE FLOOR AND YOU START YOUR POINT AND THEN ON YOUR WAY YOU MIGHT STEP ON THEM AND HURT YOURSELF
LET'S TRY PLAYING THAT C LEARN THESE NOTE NAMES D E FLAT F BACK DOWN E FLAT OPEN D GETTING YOUR HAND READY AND DOWN FOR C B FLAT
MY RIDER HAS MADE FREQUENT ATTEMPTS TO TRY TO CATCH HER HORSE
WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO SHOW WHAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO TO CATCH THAT HORSE THAT'S BECOME JUST A LITTLE BIT DISOBEDIENT
AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS WHEN YOU DO IT IT WILL POP UP A WARNING EVERY TIME YOU TRY TO START THE APPLICATION
I'M GOING TO JUST GRAB A GAME HERE AND IF YOU JUST WANT TO SEE THAT A GAME WASN'T WORKING OR ANY PROGRAM REALLY WASN'T WORKING BEFORE TRY IT OUT AND JUST RIGHT CLICK ON IT AND RUN IT AS ADMINISTRATOR AND OBVIOUSLY I AM ASSUMING YOU HAVE FULL CONTROL OF THE MACHINE AND THE ADMINISTRATOR PASSWORD
A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THAT MOST VIDEO GAMES GENERALLY ASSUME THAT THEY HAVE FULL REIGN OF THE MACHINE AND GENERALLY THAT IS NOT ACTUALLY A BAD ASSUMPTION BUT IT IS ANNOYING ON VISTA BECAUSE VISTA INSTEAD OF SIMPLY ALLOWING THIS WILL TYPICALLY POP UP WARNINGS SO IN ORDER TO TRY IT OUT FIRST THING WE ARE GOING TO BRING UP SOMETHING
ANYBODY WHO YOU CAN THINK WHO'S OVER THE TOP AND I WANT YOU TO EMBODY THAT PERSON AND TRY TO BE THEM
THAT SEED IS DRIED OUT SO THAT IT DOESN'T TRY TO GERMINATE IN THE PACKAGE
IF THEY SOUND IT OUT CORRECTLY AND DON'T TRY TO GUESS THAT IT IS A REAL WORD THEN YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE REALLY ISOLATING THEIR SKILLS
TRY THE OTHER HAND ONE TWO STRAIGHT IN AGAIN GO ONE TWO
IF YOU CUT THE HOLE FIRST AND THEN TRY TO MATCH IT IT CAN BE A LITTLE TRICKIER THAN IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD
ONCE YOUR TUBE IS IN THERE ALL THE WAY GO AHEAD AND THEN REINSTALL YOUR TIRE THE REST OF THE WAY MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING ONLY YOUR HANDS BECAUSE IF YOU DO TRY TO USE A SCREWDRIVER OR EVEN A TIRE LEVER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU CAN END UP PINCHING YOUR TUBE BETWEEN THE TIRE AND THE RIM WHICH IS THEN CALLED A PINCH FLAT
IF YOU STAY THERE AND TRY TO BLOCK IT COMES BACK
AGAIN I WANT TO TRY TO USE THE CHOPPER'S MACHINE GUNS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
AND AS YOU CAN SEE IF I TRY SCRATCHING IT NOW IT IS SIMPLY DUSTING AND MAKES SORT OF A NASTY LITTLE LINE SO WHEN IT IS LIKE THIS IT IS READY TO GO INTO THE KILN AND BE BISQUE FIRED WHICH IS THE FIRST STAGE OF THE FIRING PROCESS
TRY THAT AGAIN
TRY AND GET TO THE BACK OF THE SHOULDER A LITTLE BIT AS WELL AND THEN WORK YOUR WAY BACK DOWN AND THEN FINISH AT THE HAND A NICE GENTLE MASSAGE TOUCH ON THE HAND
AGAIN WE WANT TO DO REPS TO FAILURE ON THIS ONE BECAUSE EIGHT TWELVE REPS ISN'T GOING TO BE ENOUGH PROBABLY FOR YOU SO JUST TRY TO BUILD IT UP ONE REP AT A TIME AND DO TWO THREE SETS AND THAT'S HOW WE DO OUR TOUCH AND GO SQUATS
AND YOU WANT TO TRY TO GET IT IN A VERY THIN LINE YOU DON'T WANT IT TOO THICK
THEY'LL FREEZE TO THE SIDES OF YOUR BAIT BUCKET TO THE TOP AND THEN WHEN YOU TRY TO REMOVE THEM ALL THAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS YOUR NETTING RIPS AND YOU HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER ONE
I WOULD TRY AND STICK WITH A MEDIUM GOLDEN SHADE BECAUSE IF YOU DO TOO ASH IT MAY COME UP GREEN IF YOU DO TOO WARM IT MAY COME UP A LITTLE BRASSIE
THE PART YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS YOU WANT TO TRY TO GET YOUR HANDS LOCKED INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE SHOULDER PADS SO YOU HAVE THE LEVERAGE
IF YOU FEEL HEAT IN THE JOINT YOU MAY ALSO FIND THE THE DOG MAY OBJECT A BIT AND ALSO IN THIS CASE DON'T DO AS MUCH OF IT JUST DO A MINUTE OR TWO SEE WHAT HE'LL TOLERATE AND THEN TRY AGAIN THE NEXT TIME YOU ARE DOING A SESSION AND GRADUALLY WORK YOUR WAY UP AND YOU'LL FIND THAT THIS WILL GET EASIER AS YOU WORK WITH THE ANIMAL AND THE GENERAL ENERGY IS FLOWING SOME OF THE STIFFNESS IS RELIEVED THEN THEY ARE GOING TO BE MORE LIKELY TO TOLERATE THIS PARTICULAR AREA BEING MASSAGED
TRY A COUPLE OF THEM OUT DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO STICK TO THE FIRST ONE YOU FIND
BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO IS GET AS MUCH SPEED AND FOLLOW THROUGH ON THIS SHOT AS POSSIBLE
THE REASON THAT IS IS BECAUSE TURTLES DO HAVE A TENDENCY SOME TIMES TO LIKE TO TRY TO EAT GRAVEL
AND THEN THE LAST THING IS I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT YOU TRY TO DO CALLIGRAPHY WHILE LISTENING TO MUSIC
ONE OF THE KEY THINGS TO THINK ABOUT IS YOU WANT TO TRY AND LINE UP THE STRING WITH THE EDGE OF YOUR WRIST KIND OF
SOON AS IT FEELS LIKE IT'S GOING TO STICK YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS FLAP AND BEND IT BACKWARDS AND PUT YOUR NAIL IN THERE AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO IS GET THIS PAPER TO GO RIGHT INSIDE THAT GROOVE
AS FAR AS SOCIAL PHOBIAS GO THEY'RE GOING TO BE MORE THAN JUST YOUR USUAL SHYNESS IN PUBLIC PLACES THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE JUST THINGS WHERE YOU TRY AND AVOID SOCIAL EVENTS THEY'RE GOING TO BE THINGS THAT PROVOKE ACTUAL ANXIETY
SO WE'LL START OVER NOW AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO PUT TOGETHER THE KIND OF TEAMWORK THAT WOULD BRING US TO A VERY QUICK FINISH AND BE WITHIN THAT SIXTY SECONDS
WE WANT TO TRY TO LURE OUT THE BRUTES INDIVIDUALLY AS MUCH AS WE CAN BECAUSE THEY GET MUCH MORE POWERFUL WHEN THEY'RE WORKING IN A GROUP
SO SOMETHING THAT I CAN DO THIS IS WHERE I KEEP A LOT OF MY SUPPLIES THAT I USE EVERYDAY AND I CAN GO THROUGH THESE BASKETS AND TRY ALL THE PENS BECAUSE THE LAST TIME I DID THAT WAS A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WHEN I MOVED INTO THIS PLACE
SO I CAN TRY ALL THE PENS AND IF THEY'RE NOT WORKING THROW THEM OUT IF I DON'T WANT THEM OR IF I NEVER USE THEM THEN GIVE THEM AWAY DONATE THEM FIND A FRIEND THAT NEEDS THEM
AND I TRY TO GET ANY EXCESS BITS ON THE INSIDES OF THE BONES
BUT FOR RIGHT NOW LET'S JUST TRY IT WITH THE TOE WE'RE CHEATING SO REMEMBER WHEN WE STOP CHEATING YOU CAN'T DO THIS ANY MORE OKAY
SO BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE REALLY YOUNG THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE GOING TO IMMEDIATELY START GOING OUTSIDE AND SO IF THEY ARE GOING INSIDE GET THEM TO TRY TO GO ON A NEWSPAPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
THE FIRST THING USUALLY THAT'S EASY TO DO WHEN YOU TRY TO HOUSE TRAIN A PUPPY IS GET THEM TO RECOGNIZE WHAT THEY CAN GO ON IN THE HOUSEHOLD LIKE EVERYDAY NEWSPAPER WORKS VERY WELL
WHENEVER YOU'RE IN A RESCUE SITUATION YOU WANT TO TRY AND KEEP YOURSELF REMOVED FROM THE RIVER WITHOUT PUTTING YOURSELF TOO MUCH IN DANGER
NOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL BRAID JUST SPRAY RIGHT ALONG DOWN THE BRAID AND THEN RUB IT DOWN JUST TO TRY TO GET THOSE LITTLE STRAY HAIRS
SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS TRY TO TAKE THIS TO MY WORK TABLE HERE AND JUST BY PICKING IT UP I CAN TELL THAT IT'S GOT A GOOD SOLID SHAPE GOOD SOLID FORM IT'S NOT BOTTOM HEAVY IT'S NOT TOP HEAVY AND BASICALLY IT'S SCREAMING AT ME TO MAKE IT KIND OF SQUARE
SO WHEN YOU'RE CAMPING IN AN AREA THAT GETS USED A LOT YOU WANT TO TRY TO RESTRICT YOUR CAMPING ACTIVITY TO THE AREAS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DESIGNATED AS CAMPSITES
AGAIN OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO USE THIS SITE OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO ENJOY THE SAME EXPERIENCE YOU GOT TO ENJOY AND SO IN MORE HEAVILY USED AREAS TRY TO FIND AREAS THAT ARE ALREADY IMPACTED AND THAT ARE ALREADY USED FOR CAMPING AND TRY TO CAMP IN THOSE AREAS RESPECTFULLY AND USE THEM IN A GOOD WAY AND HOPEFULLY WHEN YOU COME BACK THEY'LL BE AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO USE THE NEXT TIME
IF YOU'RE AT A MARTIAL ARTS STUDIO OR IF YOU'RE JUST AT YOUR HOUSE IF YOU HAVE ANY FRIENDS TRY TO GO WITH EACH FRIEND AND TRY TO SEE WHO IS GOING TO BE THE BEST FIT FOR YOU
AND THAT'S A REALLY COMMON THING FOR PEOPLE TO DO AND I USED TO DO THAT TOO BUT A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU DO THAT IT PUSHES THE LIP COLOR OUT AND YOU END UP HAVING TO APPLY IT MANY MORE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY SO TRY TO JUST GET USED TO PRESSING TOGETHER GO AHEAD AND PRESS AGAIN AND IT'S GOING TO HELP TO BLEND ALL THAT COLOR TOGETHER BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO MOVE YOUR GLOSS
WHAT I TRY TO DO IS I TRY TO JUST I'LL JUST PUNCH A SMALL HOLE
NOW THAT WE KNOW HOW TO SPIN OUR POI FORWARD AND BACKWARD LET'S TRY A FUN LITTLE TRICK THAT LETS YOU SWITCH FROM GOING FORWARDS TO BACKWARDS
THIS IS AN INSTANCE WHERE KEEPING YOUR BRAIN OUT OF IT IS ACTUALLY EASIER THAN IF YOU TRY AND THINK ABOUT IT TOO HARD
AND THEN I TRY TO DO THE SAME THREE THROWS WITH MY LEFT HAND AS WELL
AT THE BEGINNING I TRY TO DO LET'S SAY THREE THROWS
THE FUN THINGS ABOUT A CONVENTION ARE THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO TRY TO HAVE AS MUCH OF A GOOD TIME AS EVERYONE ELSE
NOW I MIGHT WANT TO TRY FOR ANKLE LOCK HERE BUT HE MAY NOT MAKE THAT SO EASY FOR ME SO I CAN EASILY TRANSITION TO A SECOND SUBMISSION TOE HOLD FROM HERE AGAINST MY HIP
WHEN YOU GET CLOSE TO THE TOP IT WILL BREAK OFF WHEN YOU TRY AND DO THAT
I WANT TO TRY TO TOUCH MY HEAD TO HIS HEAD
I CAN THROW KNEES AND TRY TO LOCK DOWN AND FINISH IT OR MY OTHER OPTION IS TO STEP BEHIND
WHEN PASSING THE TOSSER IS GOING TO PASS IT TO THE TOSS IT TO THE PASSER AND THEN THE PASSER WILL USE THEIR LEGS TO KEEP THEIR BUTT DOWN FACE THEIR TARGET TO TRY TO GET INTO THE TARGET
SO LET'S TRY THAT WITH THE DRUM
I AM WATCHING THE TOP OF HIS CHEST I'M NOT REALLY LOOKING IN HIS EYES BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES THEY CAN FAKE YOU OUT AND TRY TO LOOK LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO HIT YOU SOMEWHERE
TRY TO GO GENTLY DOWN
NOW IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HOLDING ON TO THIS BALL YOU CAN ALWAYS TRY TO CROSS YOUR ANKLES BUT I RECOMMEND TRYING TO JUST POSITION YOUR FEET TO HOLD THE MEDICINE BALL
THE DOUBLE OVERLAP IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN TRY SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD KID AROUND WITH ESPECIALLY IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU'RE TOO HANDSY AND TOO WRISTY
YOU WANT TO TRY AND KEEP YOUR ELBOWS FAIRLY CLOSE
TRY TO KEEP THE STANDING LEG VERY STILL YOU DON'T WANT TO GET A BOUNCE INTO IT
NEXT STEP YOU WANT TO TAKE IT UP THE MOUNTAIN AND TRY IT GOING DOWN A LITTLE SLOPE
YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING A SERVICE FOR YOUR MATE BECAUSE IF YOU SHOW ANY SIGNS OF WEAKNESS THEY WILL POUNCE ON YOU AND TRY TO RE-DATE YOU OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE
FOR THE TIME BEING SARI WOULD BE TRY TO ESCAPE FROM THIS
MAKE SURE YOU TRY TO TURN YOUR CELL PHONE ON VIBRATE SILENT OR EVEN OFF
IF WE USED OUR ALPHABET POSTERS IF WE TOOK THE TIME WITH PHONEMIC AWARENESS IF WE ASKED THEM TO LOOK AT OUR MOUTHS AND TRY TO PRACTICE BY HOW WE'RE MAKING SOUNDS THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SOUNDS IN SPOKEN LANGUAGE
NOW BUT IF YOU CAN TRY TO LOOSEN UP AS TO HOW YOU'RE STANDING
TRY TO CREATE THE SITUATION IN SUCH A WAY THAT IS POSITIVE AND THE BIRD WANTS TO INTERACT SO THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BITE YOU INSTEAD
GOOD TRY IT AGAIN
I SELECT CONVERT TO REAL INSTRUMENT NOW LET'S TRY IT OUT SO THERE'S THIS LOOP THAT I WANT TO USE PLAYING SO I CLICK IT I DRAG IT OVER HERE AND NOW AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S BLUE NOT GREEN
I ALSO TRY TO STAY ORGANIZED AND PUT THEM IN ORDER
THE STANDING POSES YOU'RE GOING TO WORK TO TRY TO STAY IN YOUR POSES UP TO TWO MINUTES LEARNING TO BREATHE LEARNING TO RELAX AND ENJOY
I JUST GRAB THE LEAVES THOUGH I TRY NOT TO GRAB TOO MANY OF THE STEMS AND I JUST WHAT I DO IS I'LL ROLL IT LIKE SO AND THEN JUST CHOP IT
I'M FOLDING CLOTHES TODAY TO MAKE THEM GO INTO A SUITCASE AND TRY AND KEEP THEM SOMEWHAT WRINKLE FREE
UM THIS IS A MAN'S SHIRT WITH SHORT SLEEVES AND THE FIRST THING I DO IS GO FOR THE CORNERS OF THE SHOULDERS AND THEN I FOLD IT TOWARDS ITS BACK AND I PUT MY FINGER IN THE COLLAR PULL THE COLLAR UP GRAB FOR THE TOP PARTS OF THE SLEEVES AND TRY AND SHAKE IT OUT A LITTLE BIT AND THEN I LAY IT DOWN ON A FLAT SURFACE AND I TRY AND FIND WHERE THERE'S SOME PROBLEM AREAS WITH WRINKLES AND I STRETCH IT OUT SO THAT THE UNDER ARM PIT SEAMS ARE TOGETHER AND THE SIDES ARE TOGETHER AND THAT THE TAIL IS STRAIGHT JUST TO TRY AND PREVENT CREATING NEW WRINKLES
SO YOU'RE GOING TO LINE UP LIKE YOU WOULD HIT A NORMAL SHOT BUT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT BEING SUPER RELAXED BECAUSE IF YOU TRY MUSCLE THIS BALL AT ALL WHAT HAPPENS IS OFF HARD PAN THE CLUB HITS THE HARD PAN AND THEN SKIPS INTO THE BACK OF THE BALL PRODUCING A SKULL SHOT
WE'RE JUST GOING TO TRY TO KEEP IT SIMPLE IN THIS CLIP
ONE MORE TRY ONE GOOD JUST LIKE THAT
SO BASICALLY WHAT IT IS IS IT'S TWO PLAYERS WHO TURN THEIR STICKS WITH THE BACKS TOWARDS EACH OTHER WITH THE BALL IN THE MIDDLE AND YOU HAVE BOTH HANDS ON THE STICK AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GET UP UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND FLING THE BALL ABOVE YOUR HEADS AND THEN ALL THE TEAMMATES KIND OF MOVE IN TO TRY TO GET THE BALL AND GRAB POSSESSION
I PUT ALL MY BODY WEIGHT INTO THAT AND I TRY TO TRANSFER IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE HEEL OF MY LEFT HAND
SO IF YOU ARE NOT THROUGH YOU JUST HAVE TO TRY TRY TRY
THE OVERHEAD PASS IS EFFECTIVE DURING THE GAME WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF SPACE BETWEEN YOU AND THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PASS IT TO AND YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO GET IT THERE WITH SOME ZIP SO THAT THE DEFENSE DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO GET IN BETWEEN AND TRY TO STEAL THE BALL
TRY AND GET AND EVEN AMOUNT FOR YOU TO GRIP
WE'RE GOING TO TRY FOUR OBSTACLES NOW
THIS ONE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE MUSCLE YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THEM ANOTHER QUICK AS POSSIBLE TO GET IT LESS REST
WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR FEET TOGETHER YOU TRY TO JOIN THE TOES TOGETHER THE BALL OF THE FOOT THE HEEL OF THE FOOT
IDEALLY YOU TRY TO CONNECT WITH THE TOES BUT IF NEED BE TOUCH THE ARCH OF THE FOOT
AND SO MY PHILOSOPHY IS FOR THE SCRATCHING BEHAVIOR IS THAT IT'S A REALLY REALLY GOOD IDEA TO TRY AND TRAIN THE CAT PROPERLY
THEY'LL START ON ONE THEY CHOSE FROM THE AUDIENCE LIKE SAY “L' AND THEY'LL GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH FROM “L' BACK AROUND THROUGH “Z' AND “A' ALL THE WAY BACK TO “L' AND THEN THEY'LL TRY TO FINISH GOING BACKWARDS FROM “L'
YOU SHOULD REALLY TRY TO MAKE A SEPARATE CUT FOR EACH OF THOSE
TRY NOT TO WASTE ANYTHING
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY TO DO IS I'M GOING TO KEEP MY HANDS WELL BACK OF EVERYTHING
IF YOU TRY DO THIS ALL AT ONCE IT'S REAL EASY-IN THIS MOTION-TO FALL OFF GET OUT OF POSITION
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE ALWAYS STRUGGLING AND IT'S AN UPHILL BATTLE TO TRY AND GET PEOPLE WHAT THEY NEED AND THAT CAN KIND OF DRAG YOU DOWN SOME DAYS
SO EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE THEORETICALLY IN FRONT OF THIS LINE SO WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO CHALLENGE EACH OTHER BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN THE FRONT COURT
LET'S TRY A FOLKLORIC MOVE CALLED THE HIP PULL
OKAY SO LET'S TRY IT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH OUR TOE I WANT YOU TO PICK IT UP YOU'RE JUST GOING TO JUMP DON'T CHEAT IT BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS GO LIKE THIS AND THAT WAS NOT OVER THE TOP THAT WAS ACROSS THE SIDE
FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT FRONT TOGETHER BACK TOGETHER BRUSH HEEL TOE OVER THE TOP WOO HOO LET'S TRY IT ONE MORE TIME
SO LET'S TRY FRONT TOGETHER BACK TOGETHER BRUSH HEEL TOE OVER THE TOP
TAKING THAT SAME WIRE WHAT I'VE DONE IS CUT IT IN PIECES AND BEND IT AROUND SO THAT YOU HAVE A U CLAMP AND I TRY TO ATTACH IT WHERE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SEEN BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE'VE COVERED THIS WITH THE SILK FLOWERS I NEED TO PUT A HOLE IN THE FLOWERS WITH AN EXACTO KNIFE TO GET IT DOWN IN THERE
BASICALLY TRY TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS OF IT THE CAMPSITE LOOKS AND IS THE WAY AS MUCH THE WAY YOU FOUND AS POSSIBLE WHEN YOU'RE DONE
TRY TO RESTORE SOME OF THAT GROUND COVER BACK THE WAY IT WAS AND IF YOU MOVED LOGS IF YOU USED LOGS TO SIT ON AROUND THE CAMPFIRE IF YOU USED THEM TO SIT ON AS CAMP STOOLS TRY TO MOVE THOSE BACK TO WHERE YOU FOUND THEM OR PUT THEM BACK OUT IN THE WOODS SO THEY'RE NOT IN AN OBVIOUS PATTERN THAT YOU'VE CREATED
AND YOU WANT TO TRY TO FIND A QUIET PLACE
SO A SETTING DRILLS YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A TOSSER WHO WILL TOSS YOU THE BALL AND YOU GET UNDER IT YOU USE YOUR LEGS FACE YOUR TARGET AND YOU WANT TO PUSH THE BALL OUT WITH YOUR NOT ONLY YOUR WRISTS BUT YOUR LEGS ALSO AND FACE YOUR TARGET AND TRY TO GET IT IN THE TARGET
TRY AND KEEP YOUR NECK RELAXED
YOU ALWAYS WANT TO WORK IT UP WHEN YOU START IN THIS AREA AND YOU TRY TO GET AS MUCH AS YOU CAN TOWARDS THE BOTTOM
THEN WE GO INTO THE WATER WE TRY IT AND IF I NOTICE THAT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO DO IT THEN WE'LL GET BACK OUT OF THE WATER AND DO IT AGAIN
A LOT OF PEOPLE TRY TO START THEIR FORWARD ROLL ALREADY IN A SQUAT WHICH IS A LOT HARDER AND IT DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO PROGRESSION VERY EASILY
IF YOU'RE AT HOME JUST AGAIN TRY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
THEN YOU TAKE THE OTHER PART OF THE HAIR BY HOLDING YOUR HAND HERE OKAY AND IF YOU WERE AT HOME YOU'D HOLD IT HERE AND YOU'D TRY TO GET IT AROUND THIS IS REALLY DIFFICULT BUT YOU TRY YOUR BEST
HE'S GOING TO TRY TO WALK HIMSELF AROUND IN PURSUIT OF THIS RUNNING BACK COMING ACROSS
WHAT MOST PEOPLE TRY TO DO IS BRING THEIR SHOULDERS WAY FORWARD AND THIS CAN CAUSE ROTATOR CUFF ISSUES ALL KINDS OF BAD PROBLEMS
SO WHEN YOU CAN USE A STRAP IT CAN REALLY PUT YOU IN A PERFECT ALIGNMENT AND I RECOMMEND TO ANYBODY NO MATTER HOW PERFECT YOUR CHATARAUNGA DANDASANA MAYBE TO TRY IT THIS WAY JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN THE PROPER ALIGNMENT
SEE IF WE CAN TRY THIS AGAIN
SO I'M GOING TO GO OVER HERE AND TRY AND FIND A BAG THAT WOULD WORK WELL WITH THIS I'M PROBABLY GOING TO LEAN TOWARDS THIS SILVER FLASHY PURSE
NOW WHAT I WANT TO DO NEXT IS I WANT TO TRY TO COPY SOME PATTERNS SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS GRAB MY CONTROL BUTTON AND HOLD DOWN CONTROL AND COPY THIS PATTERN F SO THIS PATTERN F NOW IS COPIED NOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS PLACE IT TO AN AVAILABLE PART OF OR PLACE IT OVER SOMETHING SO I'M GOING TO GO TO MY D SHARP ACTUALLY I'M GOING TO GO TO MY F SHARP AND PASTE IT RIGHT OVER IT
YOU WANT TO BE MINDFUL IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS ABOVE YOU BEFORE YOU TAKE YOUR LADDER AND TRY TO PUT IT IN POSITION BECAUSE YOU MIGHT FIND THAT YOU COULD BE DAMAGING SOMETHING
SO A GOOD SHOULDER FAKE FRONT SHOULDER FAKE HAND GOES HALF WAY OUT SHOULDER SNAPS I STEP IN AND I'M LOOKING LIKE I AM GOING TO TRY AND KILL THEM
I MIGHT TRY A COUPI OVER THE BLADE
SO LETS TRY IT WITH THE ARMS
GET THAT WELL MIXED AND TRY TO MAKE SURE IT IS MIXED IN REALLY GOOD
OKAY TRY THAT AGAIN
SO JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU USE A CONDITIONER IN THE SHOWER AFTER YOU SHAMPOO SOMETHING LIGHT THAT DE-TANGLES AND IF IT'S REALLY BAD A LEAVE IN CONDITIONER BEFORE YOU STYLE AND THEN AGAIN YOU CAN TRY A STATIC GUARD HAIRSPRAY WATER
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE BUT I'M ROLLING MY BRUSH AROUND IN THE PAINT TOO TO TRY AND GET A NICE POINT ON IT BECAUSE MY SURFER GUY IS GOING TO HAVE SPIKEY HAIR
YOU JUST WANT TO KEEP YOUR BRANCHES REAL THIN IF YOU CAN AND TRY REALLY CAREFULLY NOT TO MAKE IT A BIG BLOB BECAUSE IF YOU DO TOO MUCH PAINT ON THERE YOU'RE GOING NOT HAVE VERY MUCH DETAIL
THE PROBLEM WITH THESE GUYS IS THAT THEY HAVE A VERY DELICATE MEMBRANE RIGHT AROUND THEIR SKIN UNDERNEATH THEIR ARMS AND IF YOU TRY TO PUT A LEASH ON THEM YOU CAN CUT INTO THAT TISSUE
I DON'T FEEL I HAVE TO TRY
HI I'M STEVE MUNOZ WITH DUNCAN BUSINESS MACHINES AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO DIAL OUT TO TRY AND FAX MACHINE TO A CERTAIN COUNTRY OVERSEAS LETS SAY
SO IT'S CRITICAL TO TRY AND BACK LIGHT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET A PURE WHITE BACKGROUND.THE WAY OF DOING THAT I THINK THE BEST WAY OF DOING THAT IS A PIECE OF A CLEAR WHITE PLEXI-GLASS THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW THE LIGHT TO COME THROUGH AND GIVES YOU THAT WHITE BACKGROUND WITHOUT OVER-EXPOSING THE JEWELRY ITSELF
WHEN YOU GET IT ONE HAND THEN TRY THE ONE HANDED ARK ONCE AGAIN
AND I WANT YOU TO TRY TO FLOAT FOR FIVE SECONDS
NOW THE FOOT IS JUST GOING TO BE VERY RELAX YOU'RE NOT GOING TO REALLY TRY TO DO MUCH WITH IT AT ALL
THEY SHOULD TRY AND REALLY BE CLOSE TO THE SAME RHYTHM
YOUR WANT TO TRY AND KEEP IT RIGHT ON RHYTHM
LET'S TRY GREEN THERE WE GO
DON'T TRY TO SING YOU KNOW YOUR AUDITION FOR AMERICAN IDOL IF YOU'VE NEVER SUNG BEFORE IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE
SO YOU GOT TO DO YOUR BEST NOT TO HAVE THE A&R DEPARTMENT WHOM IN A LOT OF CASES ARE FRUSTRATED ARTISTS TRY TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING
THE LABELS WILL TRY TO TURN YOU INTO SOMETHING THEY THINK YOU SHOULD BE AND IT WILL NEVER EVER SERVE YOU RIGHT
YES YOU NEED A HIT SINGLE IN THIS MARKET PLACE TODAY BECAUSE IT IS MORE ABOUT TRACKS TODAY THAN IT IS ABOUT ALBUMS BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU NEED NOT TO CHANGE WHO YOU ARE TO GET SIGNED OR TO TRY TO SELL YOUR MUSIC
SO THIS IS A TOUGH LIE BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE TO TRY TO GET UNDERNEATH THE BALL A LITTLE BIT TO GET IT UP
IF YOUR HAIR IS NOT ALREADY CURLY TRY USING A CURLING IRON
AND IF YOU TRY TO KEEP GETTING THAT GOOD TONE EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T HAVE THE STRING TO SNAP INTO
WHEN YOU GET TO THE E STRING YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO KEEP YOUR THUMB THERE ON THE FINGER BOARD
WHEN YOU'RE TRAINING WITH A PARTNER YOU NEVER WANT TO TRY TO THROW FAST STRIKES
SHE'S GOING TO TRY THAT RIGHT NOW
YOU DON'T WANT TO TRY TO GUESS ON EACH FENDER WHERE THE HIGH POINT IS OR WHERE A PARTICULAR BODY LINE IS YOU JUST WANT TO MEASURE A STRAIGHT LINE THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE WHEEL AND HE'S GOING TO RECORD THAT ON A PIECE OF PAPER FOR EACH CORNER AND SEE HOW THEY COMPARE
IF YOU NOTICE ON THE WINTERTIME YOU'RE DRIVING ALONG AND TRY AND USE YOUR WIPER BLADES THEY WON'T TOUCH ALL OF THE WINDSHIELD ITSELF
I AM ACTUALLY GOING TO TRY AND GET THESE PRETTY STRAIGHT
WHEN YOU CAN DO THESE TRICKS WITHOUT EVEN THINKING ABOUT THEM THEN SIT DOWN AT THE DINING ROOM TABLE AND TRY THEM OUT
YOU CAN ALSO DO DIFFERENT THINGS SUCH AS FAR AS ZOOMING TO TRY TO QUANTIZE THINGS A CERTAIN WAY AS WELL AS TRY TO EDIT IT IN WAY WHERE YOUR TRACKS WOULD BE MORE BY DRAWING IN DATA OR BRINGING IN SAMPLES WHATEVER
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN THE GOAL TO BE HITTING BEFORE THEY BEGIN EXTENDING THEIR ARM
AND IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS PROPERLY I DON'T SUGGEST YOU TRY THIS BECAUSE YOU COULD HURT YOURSELF
TRY TO DO ABOUT 25 FIFTY REPETITIONS
WELL I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU TRY TO DO THAT
SO DON'T RUN YOUR SEAT TO HIGH TRY TO RECORD OR REMEMBER WHAT YOUR MEASUREMENTS ARE ENCASE YOU HAVE TO MESS WITH THINGS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR SEAT NICE AND LEVEL AND GET OUT THERE AND HAVE A GOOD RIDE
SO TRY TO PICK SOMETHING ON THE SHORELINE NOT THE BUOY THAT YOU ARE SWIMMING FOR BUT A BOAT RAMP OR A HOME OR A LAMP POLE OR SOMETHING SO THAT IF YOU'VE GOT A SEA OF BRIGHT ORANGE CAPS IN FRONT OF YOU THAT YOU STILL KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SWIMMING FOR
A REAL PEARL HAS A VERY TINY BORE BECAUSE THEY TRY TO MAINTAIN THE VALUE OF THE PEARL
AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO INHALE AND LENGTHEN REACH YOUR TAIL BONE BACK AS YOU REACH THE CROWN OF YOUR HEAD FORWARD AND THEN EXHALE TRY TO SINK DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT DEEPER
THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO TRY TO PREVENT THAT ONE BEING DO YOUR ACRYLIC SEALANT ONCE YOUR PROJECT IS DONE
SQUEEZE YOUR LEGS TOGETHER SQUEEZE YOUR KNEES TOGETHER AS IF YOU'RE TRYING TO SQUEEZE A TIGHT BALL SQUEEZE TIGHT FOR ABOUT FIVE SECONDS RELAX AND TRY TO BEND FURTHER
NOW WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO THOUGH AND WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS WHEN WE RELAX THERE'S A SLIGHT BEND TO THE LEGS
DON'T TRY AND BURN YOUR TRASH ALUMINUM CANS PLASTIC WRAPPERS
OR TRY TO GET FIFTY A HUNDRED MILES AWAY FROM ANY BRIGHT CITY LIGHTS AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE FAINTER OBJECTS
NOW FOR MANY PEOPLE ITS UNNATURAL TO TRY TO PLAY A HORN WHILE STANDING BECAUSE FROM A EARLY AGE HORN PLAYERS ARE ALWAYS THOUGHT TO KEEP THERE BELL ON THERE THIGH WHEN THE ARE SITTING DOWN
AND SO NOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NOW THAT I'VE HOOKED THESE WIRES UP I'M GOING TO TRY ALLIGATOR CLIPPING THESE WIRES FROM THOSE POINTS FROM THE BEND POINT RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT HERE
YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO KEEP A STRAIGHT LINE FROM THE CROWN OF YOUR HEAD THROUGH YOUR SITZ BONES SO COME INTO TABLE TOP AND COW HAPPENS WHEN YOU SPIN THE SITZ BONES UP TOWARD THE CEILING DROP THE BELLY AND GENTLY RAISE THE HEART
SO AGAIN WHILE IT'S IMPORTANT TO OBSERVE THE PRINCIPLES OF PURITY AND SELF-POLLINATION VERSUS CROSS-POLLINATION JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO ISOLATE OR HAND-POLLINATE YOUR CROSS-POLLINATING CROPS DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T TRY GROWING THEIR SEED
AGAIN NOT PUTTING IT ON TOO THICK BUT NOW THAT I'VE KINDA GOT THE FINE DETAILS JUST KIND OF START FILLING IN BETWEEN THEM AND JUST TRY AND GET AS MUCH COVERAGE AS I CAN WHILE NOT MESSING UP THE DETAIL I'VE ALREADY DONE
A LOT OF PEOPLE TRY TO MAKE IT CRISP BY USING STARCH AND SIZING AND WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT
ALRIGHT WE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PUT THESE TO THE DEEP FRYER JUST THESE BITS AND WHILE THEY ARE FRYING I'M GOING TO TRY TO KEEP THEM SEPARATED
SO WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS I LIKE TO GET ABOUT HALF WAY AND I TRY TO GET A SENSE OF WHICH WAY THIS PUTT IS GOING TO BREAK
THIS ONE WE TRY NOT TO DO TOO REAL TOO FAST BECAUSE IT REALLY WILL TORQUE THE PERSON'S BACK IN A VERY REAL WAY
AND EVEN IF THEY DO DIE I TRY NOT TO TAKE IT PERSONALLY
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY IT OFF THE ROAD IN A GRASS FIELD TO BEGIN WITH
SO IF YOU DO BEGIN TO SLOW DOWN AND GET WOBBLY BEST THING TO DO IS JUST TRY AND MAINTAIN A STEADY PEDALING SPEED
SO THE OBJECTIVE ON THE BREAK IS TO OF COURSE POCKET AT LEAST ONE BALL WHICH IS THEN GOING TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY AT THE TABLE AND TRY TO POCKET MORE BALLS
USE PRODUCTS FORMULATED FOR OILY OR COMBINATION SKIN AND TRY TO AVOID TOUCHING YOUR FACE TOO OFTEN
YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THE ONES GOING FROM THE GROUND TO THE SUPPORT BEAM ONCE YOU GOT THOSE YOU GOING TO WANT TO TRY AND CROSS HATCH SOME AND PUT SOME OTHERS RUNNING THE OPPOSITE WAY AND THIS WILL GIVE YOUR SHELTER SOME MORE SUPPORT FOR LAYING COVER THE ON IT TO WHERE IT SUPPORTS IT BETTER AND IT'S A MUCH STRONGER STURDIER SHELTER
THEN AND THIS WAS BEFORE COMPUTERS WE WOULD TAKE EVERY MAJOR ARENAS SCHEDULE AND TRY AND FIGURE A METHOD IN WHICH WE COULD GO FROM ONE CITY TO THE OTHER TEAR DOWN OUR TRACK WHICH TOOK ABOUT TWO HOURS SET IT UP AGAIN WHICH TOOK ABOUT FOUR HOURS SKATE THE GAME
THESE ARE SOME OF THE WAYS THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRY TO USE TO TRY TO REDUCE THE SEVERITY OR THE INTENSITY OF THAT CREEPY CRAWLY SENSATION THAT YOU ENCOUNTER WHEN YOU GET THE RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME
LET'S TRY SLOWLY AGAIN WEIGHT SHIFT ONE
ME PERSONALLY I USUALLY TRY TO DO THREE SETS OF THESE
DID YOU EVER LIKE TRY TO FIND SOMETHING TO EAT AT SEVEN ELEVEN
I DON'T LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE COME UP LIKE THIS AND TRY TO KARATE CHOP HIM RIGHT ON THE COLLARBONE
DON'T TRY TO CUT HIS HAIR AFTER FILLING HIM UP WITH SWEETS
THE OKINAWANS THEY ARE KIND OF LIKE VERY SIMPLE MINDED THEY LIVED IN KIND OF BEACH TERRAIN THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TRY THAT KIND OF STUFF BECAUSE IT'S DANGEROUS FOR YOUR FOOTWORK YOU MIGHT SLIP
SO WHEN YOU'RE OUT HERE GUARDING YOUR MAN AND YOU GO ON HELP SIDE AGAIN YOU NEED TO STAY LOW DROP STEP AND KEEP THOSE GOOD WIDE STANCES UP OR SPRINT TO A PARTICULAR POINT TO TRY TO GET OVER AND STOP THIS GUY
NOW AS HE'S COMING IN ON THE DRIVE WHAT THIS GUY NEEDS TO DO SO MANY TIMES WE SEE OUR DEFENDERS COME IN AND THEY'LL GET HERE AND AS THIS GUY'S DRIVING BY THEY WANT TO OPEN UP AND TRY TO SWAT HIM FROM BEHIND
IF WE MOVE TO THE NEXT MEASURE WE HAVE AN F AND WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE BASE CLEF AND THE BASE CLEF HAS THE DOT ABOVE AND BELOW F LINE SO THAT IS A DEAD GIVE A WAY IF YOU WANT TO TRY YOUR GOOD BOYS DOES FINE ALWAYS AND IT WILL ALSO BRING YOU TO F ANYWAY HERE'S F AND THE VERY NEXT NOTE IS F WITH A SHARP SYMBOL IN FRONT OF IT
SO MAKE SURE YOU GET A KIND THAT HAVE A BULB IN IT LIKE THIS TO TRY AND KEEP THEM FROM TURNING IT
AND I'M GOING TO DO THE SAME THING OVER HERE AND TRY AND START TO REFORM AND RESHAPE THE EDGE OF OUR POT IN THE FOREGROUND
USUALLY THAT HAS SOME SORT OF SCRUB IN IT AND THAT JUST CLEANS OUT THOSE PORES TO TRY TO GET THEM TO SHRINK DOWN GET THE OIL AND DIRT OUT
AND SO IF YOU CAN FIND A CHALLENGING TRAIL AND ACTUALLY TIME YOURSELF ON IT AND DO REPEATS ON THAT TRAIL AND TRY TO CLEAN UP YOUR TURNING CLEAN UP YOUR SHIFTING OF YOUR WEIGHT WHERE YOU SHIFT ON THE SHIFT GEARS AND THOSE THINGS
GO OUT INTO YOUR BACKYARD AND GIVE IT A TRY
SO WHEN YOU DROP IN GO OVER ACROSS THE SPINE THEN COME DOWN PLACE YOUR TIRE JUST RIGHT WHEN YOUR READY TO JUMP AND GIVE IT A TRY
TRY IT AGAIN
WE ARE GOING TO GIVE IT A TRY BY HAND FIRST
AND THE LITTLE BABY FISH WAS SWIMMING AND SWIMMING AS HARD AS HE COULD TO TRY TO GET BACK TO PAPA BUT HE JUST KEPT GETTING FURTHER AND FURTHER AND FURTHER
YOU CAN ALSO TRY WRIST WEIGHTS THEY COME IN ONE POUND WEIGHT SO YOU CAN WRAP THEM AROUND YOUR HAND AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HOLDING ANYTHING AS YOU'RE LIFTING
IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE WHOLE ALIGNMENT ISSUE THEN TRY SINGLE ARM INSTEAD OF THE DOUBLE ARMS OR THE TWO ARMS AT THE SAME TIME
SO LET'S SAY I WERE TO NOT STAND ON THE GAS THAT WOULD ACTUALLY KILL THE DRIFT IN THESE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE CARS AND LET'S TRY AND DEMONSTRATE THAT
AT THIS POINT WHEN YOU'VE GOT MOST OF YOUR CHEST OVER THE TREE YOU THEN WANT TO KICK OVER IT AND TRY TO GET PAST IT
WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO IS TRY TO STAND WITH YOUR FEET PARALLEL
AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO BE VERY EXPLOSIVE WITH IT ALRIGHT
YOU HAVE ALL YOUR THINGS TOGETHER I WOULD PROBABLY SUGGEST TO GO AHEAD AND GET EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND ALSO TRY TO HAVE NO DISTRACTIONS AS POSSIBLE
WE CAN YOU USE THIS TO MOLD WITH IT IS VERY TEMPERATURE SENSITIVE SO YOU HAVE TRY NOT TO HANDLE IT TO MUCH AND YOU HAVE TO PUT IT BACK INTO THE REFRIGERATOR FROM TIME TO TIME AS YOUR WORKING WITH IT IF YOU FIND THAT IT BECOMES TO SOFT
YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THAT I WANT TO TRY TO GET THAT DOWN HERE AND CLEAR INTO HERE AS BEST I CAN TO GET THAT MEASUREMENT
THE SECOND THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TRY TO USE MOTIVATION TO TEACH THAT DOG TO SWIM
TRY TO LINE THEM UP A LITTLE BIT BUT REALLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR A PLACE THAT'S A SMOOTH SURFACE TO GLUE THEM ON TO
ONE DROP OF SOAP REPRESENTING A DOLLAR BILL AND WE TRY TO EVEN THOSE OUT JUST TO TRY TO GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF SUDS REPRESENTING CLEANING POWER WE'LL GO ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN WE'LL GO THIRTY DOLLARS VERSUS TEN DOLLARS
THE NEXT THING HE WANTS TO DO IS TRY TO TELL THIS GUY WHERE HE'S GOING
SO I'M GOING TO COME IN NOW AND MAKE SURE THAT I SCOOP OUT SOME CHICKEN AND SOME CHORIZO AS WELL AS CARROTS AND TOMATOES AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF ALL ON TOP SO WE CAN SEE SOME CHORIZO SOME ORANGE FROM THE CARROTS SOME WHITE FROM THE CHICKEN AND THEN I WILL COME BACK WITH OUR JUICE AND POUR THAT OVER THE TOP AND SO HERE WE HAVE OUR CORN AND RED BEAN RICE WITH OUR CHICKEN AND SAUSAGE RAGU
BUT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO RIGHT NOW IS JUST GET THE THROWS TO ALL CROSS AND NOT COLLIDE IN THE AIR AND TRY TO YOU KNOW GET THEM TO GET PAST EACH OTHER AND SEPARATE AND THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AND THERE'S THREE AND TWO ON THE OPPOSITE SIDES
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE PLAYING A MATCH TRY TO COME TO THE TENNIS COURT AND WARM UP THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE AT LEAST FIFTEEN MINUTES SO YOU HAVE GOOD TEN MINUTES TO WARM UP YOUR BODY BEFORE YOU START WITH A MATCH
SO WHEN YOU'RE FEELING STRONG YOU'VE DONE LOTS AND LOTS OF CHATURANGAS YOU'VE DONE LOTS AND LOTS OF ONE-LEGGED PLANK POSES YOU'VE DONE LOTS AND LOTS OF DOLPHINS AND YOU'RE FEELING THE INVERSIONS AND YOU'RE FEELING THE FOREARM STANCE TRY THIS ONE
WE'RE GOING TO TRY FIRST TO PULL THEIR EXISTING DUCT WORK
WE'RE GOING TO TRY THAT FIRST IF WE NEED TO THEN SUPPLEMENT THERE'S SOME GREAT NEW SYSTEMS OUT THAT WE CAN GET INTO IF WE CROSS THAT BRIDGE
WE'RE GOING TO FIRST TRY TO USE THEIR EXISTING DUCT WORK AND SEE IF THAT DOES AN EFFICIENT JOB
JUST TRY AND BUST A MANUAL GO A LITTLE FASTER JUST BE READY
TRY A FEW REPETITIONS
I WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE BALL IN THE CORNER POCKETWHICH I WOULD MAKE AND THEN I WOULD PUT MYSELF IN A POSITION YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TRY TO PLAY POSITION IT'S ANOTHER VIDEO TAPE FOLKS BUT I PUT MYSELF IN SUCH A POSITION NOW THAT I COULD PLAY THE TEN BALL IN THIS CORNER AND MAKE MY Q BALL COME OUT FOR A GOOD POSITIONING SHOT FOR THE EIGHT BALL AND WINNING THE GAME
MY TRICK IS THEY CAN'T HANDLE TOO MUCH SHADE EITHER SO IF YOU HAVE AN AREA WHERE WEEDS WON'T GROW AND THERE IS ONLY MOSS AND PINE NEEDLES DON'T EVEN TRY TO GROW HOSTA
STR SPL SKL SPR AND HAVE THEM JUST SAY THOSE AND TRY NOT TO PUT THE VOWEL ON THE END LIKE I DID
ON YOUR WHEN YOU WORK WITH PLACEMENT I ALWAYS TRY TO WORK WITH EACH CHAIR HAVING A PLACE TO PUT A CUP OF COFFEE
OFTENTIMES CUSTOMERS CALL ME AND WILL TRY TO TALK TO ME FOR AN HOUR OF WHY THEY THINK EVERY DOG SHOULD BE TAKEN TO A DOG PARK
SO WHETHER YOU'RE CASTING OR YOU JUST WANT TO PULL YOUR LINE BACK IN AFTER YOU SHOT IT OUT TO MAKE THE NEXT CAST OR WHETHER YOU'VE ACTUALLY HOOKED THE FISH AND YOU WANT TO TRY TO RETRIEVE THAT LINE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN THIS IS WHAT WE CALL STRIPING LINE RIGHT HERE
SO TECHNICALLY SPEAKING WHEN YOU LAND OR YOU TRY TO RIDE UPWIND IT'S GOING TO ALLOW YOU DO TO SO IN A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT PATTERN
YOU COULD TRY TO FIND A SMALL IRON AT HOME TO TRY THIS BUT YOU WOULDN'T WANT A STEAM IRON THAT HAS HOLES IN THE SURFACE AND YOU WOULDN'T WANT A TEFLON COATED IRON
NORMALLY THE TIMEKEEPER AT RINGSIDE IS GOING TO BE KEEPING TRACK OF THE TWO MINUTE ROUNDS AND THE MINUTE REST PERIOD IN BETWEEN BUT IF YOU HAVE A HEADS-UP YOURSELF ON APPROXIMATELY WHEN TEN SECONDS IS LEFT IN THE ROUND YOU CAN TRY TO GET YOUR BOXER A LITTLE BIT MORE EXCITED AND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABLE TO FINISH THAT ROUND IN A GOOD POSITIVE WAY
AFTER THAT THEN YOU CAN TRY TO GET YOURSELF SET UP TO WHERE YOU CAN GET SOME NBA SCOUTS LOOKING AT YOU POSSIBLY GO TO THE PROS
POSSIBLY IF YOU POSSIBLY CAN TRY TO AVERAGE DOUBLE DIGITS
THAT JOB IS TO GO AS HARD AS HE POSSIBLY CAN THROUGH THE GAP AND TRY TO GET TO THAT QUARTERBACK AND MAKE A STOP IN THE BACKFIELD
THAT MEANS WE'LL TAKE OUR LINEBACKERS AND PUT THEM ON AN ALL OUT RUN THROUGH THE LINE TO TRY TO STOP THE PLAY IN THE BACKFIELD WITH THE RUNNING BACK OR TO TRY TO GET TO A QUARTERBACK
FIRST THING TRY A TEXTURIZING SHAMPOO OR SOME TYPE OF VOLUMIZING OR CURL ENHANCING SHAMPOO TO HELP PUMP UP YOUR CURLS
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A FEW TIPS AND I WANT YOU TO TRY THEM WHEN YOU GET HOME
BRIAN GO AHEAD AND TRY IT OUT
TRY TO PUSH YOUR KNEES OUT IN A STRETCH
I'M GOING TO TRY AND AVOID AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE GETTING THAT EXTRANEOUS CRAP INTO THE CLAY SO I HAVE LESS TO CLEAN OUT BUT IT'S KIND OF INEVITABLE AND THEN AFTER I DIG SOME OF THIS OUT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO CLEAN OUT THAT EXTRANEOUS MATERIAL AND PREPARE IT FOR TESTING AND USE IN YOUR CERAMIC WORK
LET'S TRY THAT ONE MORE TIME
THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT CRIMINALS TRY TO GET INCLUDE USER NAMES PASSWORDS CREDIT CARD BANK ACCOUNT OR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS
FATS COME FROM SEEDS AND NUTS THOSE WOULD BE THE VEGETARIAN SOURCES GOOD OILS LIKE OLIVE OIL ALSO FATTY MEATS WHICH WE SHOULD TRY AND HOLD DOWN THE DIET
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF ETIQUETTE NOT ONLY WILL YOU HELP SPEED UP PLAY BUT YOU'LL ALSO BE DOING YOUR PARTNER A FAVOR BY HELPING HIM TRY TO LOCATE HIS BALL
IF YOU'RE HAVING A HARD TIME COMPLETING ONE OF YOUR TUMBLING PASSES CORRECTLY REALLY GO BACK AND TRY AND AND FIGURE OUT WHERE YOUR HEAD IS GOING IN YOUR PASS AND YOU CAN WORK ON THAT IN YOUR MIND AND AND AND RETRY IT AGAIN WITH THE PROPER HEAD POSITION
SO IT S IMPORTANT THAT WHEN WE EAT WE ENJOY THE FOOD WE TRY TO CREATE A RESTFUL ENVIRONMENT AND THAT WE DON'T HAVE GUILT OVER THE FEW GUILTY PLEASURES THAT WE HAVE LIKE A SMALL PIECE OF CHOCOLATE OR A COOKIE
GARY HAS A PRETTY GOOD SERVE RETURN DOWN THE WALL SO I'M GOING TO TRY TO FOX HIM HERE AND HIT A LOB SERVE
OK SO THAT WASN'T THAT GREAT I DIDN'T GET IT AS FAR AS I LIKED SO I'M GOING TO TRY THAT AGAIN
THERE IS THE OIL BASED PASTEL WHICH IS A LOT OF FUN AND IT BLENDS EITHER WITH Q-TIPS OR ACTUALLY I'VE TRIED IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PAINT REMOVER LACQUER THINNER AND ITS AN INTERESTING PROCESS BUT I THINK JUST TO KEEP THE SMELLS DOWN AND JUST TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN JUST TRY BLENDING IT FIRST WITH THE PROFESSIONAL Q-TIP OR THE NUBS THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER AND I'LL EXPLAIN THOSE TO YOU IN JUST A MINUTE
I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SUPPLIES THE THINGS YOU'D NEED TO HAVE OR WANT TO AT LEAST HAVE TO TRY AND START DRAWING IN PASTEL
THE NEXT THING I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO TRY TO ADD SOME TYPE OF CYMBALS AND WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS GO TO MY NEXT AVAILABLE TRACK AND THERE IS CYMBAL RIGHT HERE AND JUST HIT IT ON ONE AND PULL IT OUT AND PRESS PLAY
I'M GOING TO START WITH JUST A LITTLE BIT AND I'M GOING TO START USING MY MIXER AND SLOWLY TRY TO GET THIS STARTING TO GET THIS MIXED
DON'T USE THESE FOR FOOD PREPARATION AS WELL YOU WANT TO TRY TO PREVENT ANY CONTAMINATION FROM YOUR FOOD GETTING INTO YOUR SKIN CARE PRODUCTS AND THE OTHER WAY AROUND ALSO
YOU CAN OF COURSE TRY AND WEAR AND WEAR THIS WITH LIKE FUN COLOR TYPE OF SHOES SUCH AS LIKE THIS ORANGE ONE WITH GOLD
THE SIMPLER YOU KEEP IT THE MORE CLASSIC YOU WILL LOOK BUT OF COURSE YOU CAN ALWAYS TRY AND HAVE DIFFERENT PIECES LIKE FASHIONABLE TYPE OF PIECES WITH DRESSES
ALSO MAYBE TRY BRAIDING YOUR HAIR AT NIGHT
NOW THE QUARTERBACK WILL TURN AND RUN TO THIS SIDE OF THE FIELD AND TRY TO HELP OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLAY
SO THE QUARTERBACK'S JOB IS JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ON THE REVERSE WHERE HE'LL FAKE THE PLAY CARRY OUT THE HAND OFF OF THE PLAY AND THEN HE'LL TRY TO GET INTO THE ACTION OF THE PLAY AND GET THE CHANCE TO THROW A BLOCK
WE THEN WANT TO TRY AND PUT THE WHOLE TOSS OF THE BALL AS YOU ARE TAKING IT BACK
SO WE CAN TRY THAT WITH THE DRUM RHYTHM A LITTLE BIT
I AM GOING TO TRY AND GET RID OF THAT THAT SHADOW IN ANOTHER WAY
SO REALLY IF YOU WANT TO LEARN IT THE BEST TRY TO DO IT OUT OF THE WATER FIRST AND COUNT IN YOUR HEAD
SO I'M GOING TO TRY MY SAND WEDGE SO HERE I'M NOT TRYING TO SPIN IT OR PUT ON THE GREEN I'M JUST TRYING TO ADVANCE THE BALL TOWARD THE GREEN OR TO GET IT TO THE GREEN WITH A FULL CLUB
ALL I WANT TO DO IS COME STRAIGHT UP HIS CENTER LINE BUT I DON'T WANT TO TRY TO RAISE MY ARMS UP THAT WILL NEVER WORK
I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT YOU BUY ROCK CLIMBING SHOES ON LINE SIMPLY FOR THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T TRY THEM ON
I WANT YOU TO GO AHEAD AND TRY AND PLAY IT WITH ME
I WANT TRY TO BRING AS FEW COWS AS I CAN SO THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORK QUITE SO HARD AT PROTECTING THAT IMPORTANT SPACE
THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT YOU SHOULD DO IS JUST LOOK ON THE INTERNET GET SOME CARDS MADE AND TRY TO MAKE SOME CONNECTIONS THROUGH PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING EVENTS
THEY CAN ALSO WORK WITH ALCOHOL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THEIR OWN STATES TO WHERE THEY ACTUALLY ARE TRAINED TO GO IN AND DO THINGS LIKE ALCOHOL PURCHASE SURVEYS TO WHERE THEY'LL GO IN AND ACTUALLY GO TO A CONVENIENCE STORE AND TRY AND PURCHASE ALCOHOL AND THEN WE TRACK THOSE AND SAY LOOK THERE'S AN ISSUE HERE
SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS WE DO ARE SHOULDER TAPS TO WHERE WE'LL GO IN AND TRAIN THEM TO WHERE THEY'LL GO UP TO PEOPLE IN THE PARKING LOT OF MAYBE A GROCERY STORE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND TRY AND GET THEM TO PURCHASE ALCOHOL AS WELL
THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT APPROACHES BUT THE APPROACH TO TRY TO LIGHT IT IS BASICALLY THE SAME
LET'S TRY IT FROM THE TOP ONE MORE TIME
WHICH ONE YOU USE BUT JUST SINCE THE NAME IS CASA NOBLE MARGARITA OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT TO TRY TO USE THAT IF YOU WANT TO BE AUTHENTIC
THE ONLY REAL RISK THAT THERE IS IN WORKING WITH CIRCUIT BOARDS FROM AN ELECTRONICS POINT OF VIEW IS SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT A BEND OR TRY SOMETHING OUT THAT MIGHT FRY SOMETHING IN THE CIRCUIT BOARD LIKE YOU MIGHT FRY A CAPACITOR OR MAYBE IF YOU SEND LIKE A LOT OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE BOARD TOO CLOSE TO THE POWER SOURCE OR TOO CLOSE TO CAPACITORS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IF YOU TAKE AND ROLLED A LOG SOMEWHERE TRY AND ROLL THAT LOG BACK
JUST GET OUT THERE AND TRY IT
SO LET'S TRY A SEVEN POINT WAVE YOU GUYS
LET'S TRY IT A LITTLE FASTER
BUT THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF PREP WORK YOU WANT TO DO BEFORE YOU TRY TO SHOW YOUR WORK OUT IN PUBLIC
YOU WANT TO SURROUND YOURSELF WITH FRIENDS WHO ARE SUPPORTIVE AND EMOTIONALLY THERE FOR YOU AND PERHAPS IN THE BEGINNING YOU'RE TOO GUN SHY TO START DATING AGAIN SO ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO DO IS TRY TO GO OUT IN GROUPS IN GROUP ACTIVITIES
NOW TRY PUTTING YOUR ARMS OUT OKAY
SO I'M GOING TO COME OVER UNDER MY KNEES AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO SPREAD MY TOES AS WIDE AS I CAN AND JUST SIT BACK ON MY HEELS ADDING A LITTLE PRESSURE
SO I AM GOING TO TRY AND CUT THE THREE MY PIECES THAT ARE NUMBERED THREE AND SIX THESE TWO RECTANGLES OUT OF THE SAME PIECE
I'M GOING TO TRY AND SAVE AS MUCH GLASS AS I CAN SO I AM GOING TO MAKE ONE LINE
I MEAN ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN REALLY THINK OF OR THAT YOU EXPERIENCE EVERY DAY JUST TRY IT BECAUSE IT NEVER HURTS TO JUST COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT'S OUT OF YOUR MIND OR WHATEVER
I'M GOING TO TRY AND PLACE MY KNEES ON THE OUTSIDE OF MY SHOULDERS
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY TODAY OUT HERE I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TWENTY MINUTES
LET'S TRY A WAVE
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN
SHE'S GOING TO TRY TO KEEP THIS LEG ACTIVE BUT SHE'S GOING TO USE THIS STRAP TO ASSIST HER AND SHE'S GOING TO USE AN INHALE TO ALERT THE BODY AND THEN ON THE EXHALE SHE'S GOING TO BRING THAT LEG OVER TO THE RIGHT
LOOK AT THE FURTHEST POINT YOU CAN POSSIBLY SEE AND TRY AND GET THAT BALANCE AS CLEAN AS YOU CAN
THIS IS AN ACTIVITY THAT IS POTENTIALLY FEAR INDUCING FOR YOUR DOG SO YOU WANT TO WORK SLOWLY AND TRY NOT TO HAVE ANY ACCIDENTS WHERE YOUR DOG ACTUALLY IS THROWN FROM THE TREADMILL WHICH WOULD MAKE YOUR DOG MUCH MORE WARY ABOUT PUTTING FOOT ON IT AGAIN
TRY WORKING UP TO ABOUT TEN REPS WITH RIGHT FOOT OVER LEFT AND THEN STRETCH IN BETWEEN IF YOU NEED TO AND CROSS LEFT OVER RIGHT AND CURL CRUNCH BREATHE INHALE DOWN
TRY TO STAY IN EITHER MULTIPLES OF THREE OR TWO BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE PATTERN WORKS AS WE EXPAND ON OUR CIRCLE
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT DON'T TRY TO LEAN FORWARD OR STRUGGLE
SO I ALWAYS TRY TO REMEMBER WHERE'S MY NEGATIVE
WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS JUGGLING TRICKS AND ONE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE TRY TO LEARN EARLY
IF YOU DON'T FIND ONE JUST TRY AND LINE UP THE SEAMS AND SEE IF YOU CAN GET THE SEAMS LINED UP
MY PARTNERS HERE MY FRIENDS HERE AT THE STUDIOS WANTS ME TO DO SOME KIND OF SPACESHIP IN PASTELS SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO IS MORE OF A SPACESHIP SLASH PLANE HERE
THERE A GOOD TRICK IS IF THE CONCEALER REALLY COVERS UP IS TO IF YOU ARE IN THE STORE AND YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO TEST YOUR PRODUCT IS TO CHECK ON THE BACK OF YOUR HAND AND TRY TO COVER UP YOU KNOW ANY BLUE VEINS THAT YOU SEE THERE USUALLY A LITTLE MORE VISIBLE ON FAIR-SKIN PEOPLE
IT'S GOOD TO USE IN BAKING TO REPLACE AN EGG OBVIOUSLY BUT DON'T TRY TO MAKE A SCRAMBLED EGG CAUSE IT WON'T WORK
AND AGAIN IF YOU CHOOSE TO TRY TO DO THESE AND MIX THEM UP FRONT KICK SIDE KICK SORT OF BACK SWING RIGHT HERE YOU CAN DO THAT IF YOU LIKE TO MIX IT UP A LITTLE BIT
SO LET'S TRY IT
SO HE PLAYS A LITTLE LIKE THIS SOMETIMES NOT I CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING LIKE HIM BUT I'LL TRY
SO JUST GO AND TRY IT AND MESS AROUND AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AND YOU WILL PROBABLY COME UP WITH SOMETHING COOL OF YOUR OWN
NOW THE MORE YOU TRY THIS THE MORE BETTER PREPARED YOU'LL BE WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF YOUR NOSEBLUNT SLIDE
SO THE WAY I EXPLAIN THIS TO PEOPLE IS DON'T EVER TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHICH HAND IS WHAT NUMBER
IT WILL TRY TO GIVE YOU THE LARGEST APERTURE SETTING IN ORDER TO MAKE THE BACKGROUND BLUR OUT A LOT AND IT WILL HELP TO MAKE YOUR SUBJECT OR YOUR PORTRAIT INDIVIDUAL STAND OUT FROM THE BACKGROUND
I'M GOING TO MIX IT AROUND TRY TO MAKE SURE I GET ALL THOSE EMBERS DON'T LEAVE ANYTHING AT ALL TO START ANOTHER FIRE WITHOUT ME KNOWING ABOUT IT
THE FIRST THING THAT YOU SHOULD TRY AND DO IS SWIM AS AGGRESSIVELY AS YOU CAN AROUND THE STRAINER TO AVOID IT FIRST AND FOREMOST
NOW LET'S TRY IT A LITTLE FASTER
SO IF THESE GET DIRTY TRY TO BRUSH THEM OFF WITH A DRY CLOTH
FOR THIS OLD CAR WE'RE JUST GOING TO PUT THE BATTERY IN AND TRY TO GET TO OUR NEXT DESTINATION
AND YOU JUST WANT THEM TO LOOK DON'T TRY TO CATCH THEM WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TRY TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE ALL CATCHABLE
JUST YOU KNOW TRY TO GET THEM TO FALL IN AN AREA WHERE YOU CAN SEE THEM FALLING AND YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE TRYING TO CATCH THEM IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO CATCH THEM
WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY TO DO IS THROW ALL FIVE OF THEM UP IN THE AIR NICE AND THEY'RE ALL GOING TO CROSS
WHATEVER IT IS TRY TO USE MOTIVATION
YOU CAN ALSO TRY A MORE CHALLENGING POSITION WITH THE LEGS EXTENDED AND JUST BRINGING YOUR ARMS OVERHEAD OR WHAT SEEMS OVERHEAD IN THIS POSITION AND THEN DOWN
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN WHERE TO PLACE YOUR FEET ON THE BOARD AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN THE PROPER SPEED AND YOU NEED TO KNOW THE NICE FLAT SMOOTH SURFACE TO TRY IT ON
SO TRY IT ONE MORE TIME THEN WE'LL TAKE IT FROM THE TOP
SET FOR A LITTLE BIT MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT THE BALANCE AND SET HIM BACK UP GIVE THE JOD AND TRY AGAIN
I TRY TO SAY HEY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THIS OR IF YOU KNOW BUT YOU COULD PLAY WHEELCHAIR BASKETBALL AND THEY LOOK AT ME LIKE BUT IF I CAN GET THEM TO COME OUT AND GET THEM TO TRY AND GET THEM TO WATCH OUR TEAM AND GET THEM TO REALIZE WE TRAVEL AND WE HAVE FUN AND WE'RE SEMI-PROFESSIONAL SOMETIMES IT GETS IN THEIR BLOOD AND THEY'RE HOOKED FOR LIFE BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE RIGHT OUT THERE RIGHT NOW WHO CAN PLAY THIS GAME AND THEY JUST DON'T EVEN KNOW IT OR THINK THEY CAN'T BUT THEY OUGHT TO GIVE IT A SHOT
WELL I TRY AND CHASE HIM DOWN
REMEMBER TO TRY THIS AS OFTEN AS YOU CAN TO GET REALLY GOOD AT IT
AND THEN USUALLY TRY AND SEE HOW HIGH YOU CAN GO
IF YOU WANT TO JUST GAIN MUSCLE AND NOT BULK UP BUT JUST GAIN MUSCLE YOU WOULD TRY TO DO ABOUT THREE THIRTY MINUTE SESSIONS THREE DAYS A WEEK SO A COUPLE THINGS TO THINK ABOUT
CARDIOVASCULAR TRAINING IS STILL NECESSARY BECAUSE YOU STILL NEED TO KEEP THAT HEART RATE UP AND YOUR CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM IN GOOD SHAPE SO TRY THAT ABOUT ONE DAY A WEEK MAYBE TWO DAYS A WEEK
IF YOUR GOAL IS TO GET LEAN THAT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORY TRY TO DO ABOUT FIVE TO SIX DAYS A WEEK ABOUT THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES SESSIONS AND YOU WANT TO TRY TO PUSH YOURSELF BETWEEN THE 75 AND EIGHTY PERCENTILE OF YOUR MAXIMUM HEART RATE SO A GOOD THING TO DO IS TO HECK THE HEART RATE ON THE MONITORS THAT ARE ON THE EQUIPMENT THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR LOCAL GYM
STARTING OUT SLOW AND THEN WE WILL INCREASE THE SPEED AND WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF ROOM TO WORK WITH SO WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO ILLUSTRATE IS HE IS GOING TO MOVE AROUND ACTUALLY IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO MOVE AROUND AND HE IS GOING TO FOLLOW ME AROUND AND TRY AND MAINTAIN THIS POSITION
IT'S KEY TO TRY THIS SO TRY A COUPLE OF TIMES WITH A FRIEND AROUND SO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE
LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN
AND I CAN'T TRY TO TALK PEOPLE OUT OF THAT ENOUGH
MAYBE YOU WANT TO TRY TO FIND LINES THAT ARE SMALLER
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS IF YOU TRY TO RUN THE SAME TYPE OF WOOFERS YOU'LL BE RUNNING WITH THIS AMPLIFIER OR THAT AMPLIFIER THERE WILL BE A BIG DIFFERENCE VOLUME WISE SOUND WISE QUALITY WISE AND DISTORTION WISE
MOST KIDS THAT AGE ARE GOING TO TRY TO TEAR UP THE MASK AND MAKES FOR A FAIRLY UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE ALL THE WAY AROUND
THE LAST THING I WANT AND TRY TO DO I STILL WANT TO CREATIVE SOME MORE SEPARATION IN THAT ONE DARK AREA BEHIND THE NECK IS A LITTLE FRUSTRATING TO ME
SO TRY THAT A FEW TIMES AND PUT IT IN YOUR DANCE
I'LL JUST HAVE TO TRY A LITTLE BIT OF THIS DIP IT IN THE SAUCE
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING ME AND TRY THESE RECIPES OUT
YOU'LL REALLY ENJOY THEM AND MAYBE YOU'LL WOULDN'T WANT TO NICE STEAK AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY THIS FOR A CHANGE
SO I CAN USE A GOOD AMOUNT FOR MY EIGHT TO TEN OUNCES BUT I WANT TO TRY IT STRONGER
SO TRY TO WORK ON THOSE EASY DAY ON A SMOOTH PEDAL STROKE SITTING REAL SQUARE IN THE SADDLE AND PEDALING NICE CIRCLES
SOME OF THOSE ONES THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO GET OFF YOU MIGHT EVEN TRY GOING TO A CAR WASH AND USING THE HIGH PRESSURE GUN ON
NOW YOU SHOULDN'T TRY FAKIE OLLIES UNTIL YOU'VE GOT CLEAN OLLIES ROLLING FORWARD AND ONCE YOU'VE GOT THOSE DOWN AND YOU'RE ABLE TO POP THEM NICE AND CLEANLY AND DO THEM ROLLING PRETTY FAST
MOST IMPORTANT NEVER TRY TO WORK IF YOU ARE TIRED NEVER TRY TO TURN IF YOU HAVE CONSUMED ALCOHOL OR HAVE TAKEN ANY DRUGS
JUST KEEP A SHORT DISTANCE BETWEEN EACH OTHER MAYBE TWO METERS OR THREE BUT IF IT IS MORE THAN THAT IS TOO LONG AND TRY TO GO IN THE SAME WAY AS THE OTHER PERSON WHO IS IN FRONT OF YOU IS GOING SO IF THE OTHER PERSON IS SITTING HIS OR HER BUTT DOWN AND SLIDING BY FEET FIRST SOMEWHERE IN A HOLE JUST DO THE SAME
DON'T JUMP NEVER JUMP ALWAYS TRY TO CLIMB
NOW I GRAB THE PICTURE UP HERE SO YOU ARE JUST SEEING THE TOP PART LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN
AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO THAT FOR IF YOU HAVE A TIMER TRY THAT FOR THIRTY SECONDS AND THEN AFTER YOU GET THAT FOR THIRTY SECONDS HAVE SOMEONE TIME YOU AND YOU DO THE EXACT SAME THING JUST THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION GOING THIS WAY
SO LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN BOTTOM TO THEIR STOMACH THERE YOU GO OUT UNDERNEATH AND THEN YOU ESCAPE AND THAT'S AN ESCAPE FROM A BEAR HUG
REMEMBER TO GET RID OF WHITEHEADS USE HOT COMPRESSES EXFOLIATE YOUR SKIN WITH AN OATMEAL TREATMENT AND TRY AN OVER THE COUNTER BENZOYL PEROXIDE
TRY TO KEEP YOUR HANDS AND HAIR AWAY FROM YOUR FACE
YES TRY TO KEEP IT IN
AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS JUST TRY TO BRING MY HEELS HIGH AS YOU CAN
SO IF YOU'RE A BIG CAPTAIN AND COKE FAN IT'S USUALLY WHAT YOU ORDER AT THE BAR OR WHAT YOU SIP AT HOME YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY OUT THE CAPTAIN PEPPERS FOR A LITTLE BIT OF SOMETHING DIFFERENT
SO YOU WANT TO TRY FIND YOUR HIP BONES POINT BOTH YOUR HEADLIGHTS FORWARD
MY NAME IS JAMES WITH THE RESURGENCE GROUP AND WE SPECIALIZE IN AUTO INSURANCE AND THE ONE THING THAT WE REALLY TRY AND STRESS IS THAT IT IS NICE TO HAVE AN AGENT THAT YOU CAN GO IN AND SEE AND SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS WITH THEM ALL OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS OVER THE YEARS THAT CHANGE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE PROPER INSURANCE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU NEED IT AND THAT IS WHEN THEY HAVE THAT LOSS WHEN YOU HAVE AN ACCIDENT AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE PROPERLY COVERED
IF I DON'T DO THAT AND I STEP IN AND TRY AND TRIP HIM HE CAN THROW ME BACKWARDS
AND THEN TREAT THE RUST MAYBE WIRE BRUSHING OFF THE LOOSE RUST AND TRY NOT TO FLUFF IT UP AND SPREAD IT AROUND IN YOUR ENGINE COMPARTMENT BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY ABRASIVE
THE ONE THING YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS TRY NOT TO LEAD THE MOVEMENT WITH THE HEAD BUT KEEP THE HEAD IN LINE WITH THE SPINE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN
ANOTHER ONE IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TWO OR THREE NUMBERS THAT APPEAR ON THE NUMBER PLATES AND YOU TRY TO ADD THEM UP AND THE QUICKEST ONE YOU WIN
SO A BIG A BIG INCENTIVE FOR THEM WAS TO TRY TO MAKE CLOCKS THAT WERE INEXPENSIVE
AND OF COURSE YOU CAN TRY THINGS LIKE LITTLE TOP JACKETS LIKE THIS ONE LIKE IF YOU'RE GOING OUT AT NIGHT
OF COURSE YOU CAN TRY IT WITH A SWEATER ON TOP DIFFERENT COLOR SWEATERS AND IF YOU LIVE IN A COLDER CLIMATE YOU CAN TRY A TRENCH COAT JUST ABOVE YOU KNOW JUST ON TOP OF THE BLACK DRESS
LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN
SHE'S GOT HER A GOOD POSITION SHE'S STRONG IN HER SEAT SHE'S READY TO TRY TO USE THAT DART LIKE STICK IT
YOU PULL IT OUT OF YOUR GARAGE JUST TRY AND POP A WHEELIE
IT WILL BE A LITTLE BIT SLOWER SO WE CAN TRY AND HIGHLIGHT AND EMPHASIZE THE SKILL AND STRATEGY INVOLVED
YOU NOTICE THE MAIN THING IS ONE QUESTION HAVE YOUR CHILD TRY TO PREDICT IT MOTIVATES THEM IT GETS THEM ENGAGED IN THE STORY AND IT STARTS CREATING JUDGMENT AND CREATIVE AND CRITICAL THINKING
WE TEND TO TRY TO READ THE OTHER PERSON'S MIND AND PERCEIVE WHAT THEY'RE FEELING WHAT THEY'RE THINKING WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE RELATIONSHIP AND YOU WANT TO AVOID THAT
LET'S JUST TRY CHAIR POSE WITHOUT ARMS JUST LET THEM RELAX BY YOUR SIDE
YOU WANT TO TRY TO GET AS EVEN A STREAM OF GLUE AS POSSIBLE AND IF IT GETS THICK IN A SPOT YOU CAN JUST TAKE A TOOTHPICK OR A PIN AND KIND OF STRETCH IT OUT OR MOVE IT AROUND IF IT'S TOO THICK
I HAVE A SENSE OF HOW FAST IT WOULD BE FROM HALFWAY AND THEN I TRY TO PUTT IT TO THAT HALFWAY POINT WITH THE RIGHT SPEED
WE ARE GOING TO REPEAT BETWEEN EIGHT AND FIFTEEN REPS YOU ARE EXHALING AS YOU PUSH UP AND INHALE AS YOU LOWER DOWN SO THINGS TO REALLY THINK ABOUT IS TO KEEP YOUR WRIST STRAIGHT TRY NOT TO LET THEM COCK TRY NOT TO LET YOUR ELBOWS DROP DOWN BELOW THE SHOULDERS KEEP THEM IN LINE WITH THE SHOULDERS AS YOU PUSH UP
YOUR LEFT SIDE YOUR WEAKER SIDE AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WEAKER IF YOU'RE A RIGHT HANDER TRY THROWING A BALL LEFTY SEE HOW FAR IT GOES
ONE LAST THING YOU CAN TRY TOO AFTER YOU'VE BEEN STUDYING SOMEONE'S SONG STRUCTURE IS TO TAKE A SONG THAT YOU'VE WRITTEN WRITE OUT THE STRUCTURE THE SAME WAY YOU DID THEIRS TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND SAY HUM WHAT IF I TRY WHAT THEY DID AND SWITCH YOUR SONG A LITTLE BIT THAT WAY
IT'S UNNATURAL IT'S NOT WHAT YOU WOULD INSTINCTIVELY DO BUT THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD UPON YOUR IDEAS IS TO BREAK WITH YOUR INITIAL INSTINCTS AND TRY NEW THINGS
TO GET THEM TO ACTUALLY CATCH IT IT'S REALLY THE SAME THING JUST A MATTER OF TIMING IT RIGHT LET'S TRY IT
WHAT YOU WANT TO TRY TO DO IS MAKE THIS CARROT FLAT SO IT DOESN'T GO ALL OVER THE BOARD
IF YOU MAKE THE TEAM WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO WELL FIRST OF ALL TRY OUR FOR YOUR HIGH SCHOOL TEAM
I'M TRAVIS CORPERING AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO TEACH YOU JUST HOW TO GET RECRUITED INTO A BASKETBALL PROGRAM
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO FIRST OF ALL IS YOU WANT TO TRY YOUR BEST
ONCE YOU TRY OUT FOR YOUR HIGH SCHOOL TEAM IF YOU GET YOUR SKILLS UP ENOUGH TO WHERE YOU CAN MAKE IT AND THAT'S A LOT OF HARD WORK
TRY TO HIT IT WITH THE BITTERS
IT CAN ALSO TRY TO HELP YOU ACHIEVE THAT STRAIGHT HOWEVER THE RELAXER WILL MORE OF LESS DO MORE OF A RELAXATION ON YOUR CURL AND NOT NECESSARILY STRAIGHTEN IT
THE NEXT ONE WILL BE THE FIGURE EIGHT DRILL WHICH YOU GO BETWEEN YOUR LEGS FIGURE EIGHT TRY THAT WAY AND THEN REVERSE IT AND GO THE OTHER WAY THIRTY SECONDS A PIECE
TRY THAT THIRTY SECONDS ONE WAY AND THIRTY SECONDS AGAIN FOR THE FINISH UP REP AND THE LAST ONE YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO TRY AND JUST GET ONE ONE BALL MAYBE HAVE A DEFENSIVE MAN AND WORK ON SIMPLY DRIBBLING
TRY IT ONE WAY AND THEN GO BACK THE OTHER DIRECTION
CRUNCH AND EXHALE AS YOU CONTRACT INHALE BACK DOWN SO YOU CAN GET FRESH OXYGEN WORKING BACK INTO THE MUSCLE BEFORE YOU TRY TO CONTRACT AGAIN AND EXHALE
MAKE SURE THAT YOU COME CLEAN ABOUT IT AND LET THEM KNOW THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED AND NOT TRY AND COVER THINGS LIKE THAT UP SO THOSE ARE SOME TIPS
SO I'M GOING TO SPIN IT CLOCKWISE SPIN I'M GOING TO DO A UNDER THE LEG PULL OUT TO THE ANGLE SET TRY THAT ONE AGAIN
WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT FLAT SETS SETTING THE DISK UP FLAT AND TIPPING IT UP FLAT BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE REALLY GOING TO TRY TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO SET IT UP WITH AN ANGLE
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS COME INTO A NICE EVEN ANGLE WITH YOUR BALANCE TRAINER PLACE ONE FOOT AND TRY TO KEEP IT FAIRLY BALANCED IN THE CENTER OF YOUR BALANCE TRAINER BOTH HANDS ON YOUR MEDICINE BALL
I GRAB THAT AND I TRY AND FLATTEN IT OUT
AS YOU BRING THE BALL DOWN THE FLOOR YOU'VE GOT TO GO AGGRESSIVELY TO TRY TO SCORE
SO I ALWAYS TRY TO KEEP MY WORDS UP HERE
TRY THAT TEN OR TWELVE TIMES AND YOU'VE GO YOURSELF PERFECTLY SETUP TO ACTUALLY PLAY THE INSTRUMENT
ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER IS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST PLACE PIECES ANYWHERE AND THEN TRY AND FILL IN THE EMPTY SPACES
ANOTHER THING I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT IS THE TONGUE POSITION AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS GOING TO SOUND A LITTLE WEIRD BUT JUST TRY IT OUT
TRY NOT TO CUT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE WIRE JUST CLAMP DOWN ON AND TWIST THE SCISSORS AROUND THE WIRE UNTIL IT'S READY TO COME OFF
AND THEN YOU CAN GRAB A NEW INNER TUBE OR EITHER TRY TO PATCH THE FLAT ONE
IF WE'RE MOVING TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT WE SHOULD ALSO TRY TO KEEP THAT SHOULDER ABOVE THE KNEE AT ALL TIMES SO THAT WE'RE NOT LEANING TOO FAR OFF TO ONE SIDE
GIVE IT A TRY SOME TIME BIGGER FULL-BODY REALLY RANGY LONG DEEP LEGS GOOD BREW
BUT TRADITIONAL YAHAMAHAI AND TRADITIONAL KIMOTO METHOD WHICH IS A POLE RAM METHOD WHERE THEY USED TO LITERALLY BEAT PULVERIZE IN A TUB USING LONG PADDLES THIS RICE STEAMED RICE TO TRY TO PROMOTE LACTIC ACID WHICH THEY DIDN'T KNOW REALLY KIND OF OCCURRED BY ITSELF IN ANY CASE
SO WE FIRST GO OUT AND TRY TO ACHIEVE THE PURCHASE OF A GOOD COW HORSE KEEP THOSE COW SKILLS ALIVE KEEP WORKING THEM ON THE COWS BUT WE ALSO LET THEM GET JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE IN THEIR EFFORTS TO CHALLENGE THOSE COW MOVES WHEN WE NEED THEM AT THE BRINK OF A SECOND
AND TRY NOT TO UNDO ANY OF THE THREADS ON THESE
SO WHEN YOU'VE GOT STATIC GOING ON YOU CAN TRY A LITTLE BIT OF WATER AND JUST SPRAY IT
TRY TO GET IT AS THIN AS POSSIBLE
AND THOSE ARE ALWAYS AT ODDS SO THEY TRY AND GET BOTH OF THEIR NEEDS MET AND END UP DOING NOTHING
TRY TO TWIST IT
SO WITH OUR ONE LOOP WE'RE GOING TO CHAIN ONE TWO AND TRY TO KEEP YOUR LOOP ABOUT THE SAME
AND WHAT I AM LOOKING TO REALLY TRY AND DO IS KEEP MY TORSO POWER IN FRONT OF MY KAYAK
THIS IS WHERE I USUALLY GET MYSELF IN TROUBLE BECAUSE I TRY TO MAKE IT TOO THIN BUT WE'RE NO WHERE NEAR THAT POINT RIGHT NOW
SO ACTUALLY IF YOU TAKE OVER AND YOU TRY AND TAKE CONTROL FROM THEM YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY WORSEN THEIR SYMPTOMS
AND THEN USING THE BLUR TOOLS AND THE SMUDGE TOOLS I'D TRY TO BLEND THAT IN A LITTLE MORE SO THAT WHAT WE'D END UP WITH IS SOMETHING THAT LOOKS A LOT LIKE A TEXTURE MAP
WHEN YOU'RE DOING YOUR PULL UPS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KEEP YOUR BACK NICE AND STRAIGHT SHOULDERS RELAXED AND YOU WANT TO TRY YOUR BEST NOT TO SWING
TRY TO GET THREE NICE EVEN SOUNDS ONE TWO THREE ONE TWO THREE ONE TWO THREE A LITTLE FASTER
THE VERY FIRST TIMES YOU TRY IT YOU DON'T WANT TO PULL BACK TOO MUCH BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO LOOP OUT
IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS DOING IT ON ONE NAIL YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY TWO NAILS OR YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY WHAT WE CALL THE CLAW USE ALL OF YOUR FINGERNAILS SO ALL OF YOUR NAILS ARE IN CONTACT WITH THE BOTTOM OF THE FRISBEE
TRY THIS ONE MORE TIME
SO YOU SHOULD CHECK YOUR CAMERA MANUAL TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHY IT IS NOT WORKING AND SOLVE THAT PROBLEM
TRY DIFFERENT RAZORS
THIS ONE IS ROUGHLY AN E AND THIS ONE IS CLOSER TO A LOW D YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN THAT JUST BY LOOKING SO IF YOU'RE SHOPPING FOR A DIDGERIDOO THAT NEEDS TO BE IN A SPECIFIC KEY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU GO AND PLAY IT AND TRY IT OUT AND KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT YOU'RE GETTING
THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO KNOW IS TO TRY THE INSTRUMENT OUT AND SEE WHAT KEY IT'S IN
SO TRY IT AGAIN
IF YOU WANT TO STOP AND POWDER YOU HAVE ALWAYS GOT TO KEEP YOUR NOSE UP LEAN BACK WHICH DEFINITELY HELPS IF YOU RIDE BOARDS BECAUSE THEY ARE BUILT WITH THEIR STANDS BACK A LITTLE BIT BUT KEEP YOUR NOSE UP AND JUST TRY TO THINK OF IT LIKE THAT IF YOU WILL AND THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO STOP
YOU'LL TRY TO STOP AND YOU'LL JUST ALL THE SNOW IS ON TOP OF YOUR BOARD AND YOU'LL JUST END UP TOPPLING OVER SO YOU HAVE GOT TO THINK OF HOW FAST YOU ARE GOING
IT HAS HAPPENED TO ME BUT JUST TRY TO THINK OF HOW FAST YOU'RE GOING AND YOU'LL GET IT FROM THERE
JUST TRY TO DO IT AS GENTLY AS YOU CAN FOR THE TIME BEING UNTIL YOU CAN GET IT SOMEBODY THAT CAN STRAIGHTEN THAT OUT INDEFINITELY FOR YOU
YOU WANT TO TRY TO DO THIS BETWEEN EIGHT AND TEN TIMES IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER ADDING MORE REPS AS YOU GO
I'M BASICALLY GOING TO MAKE A BEAT AND TRY TO USE AS MANY SHORTCUTS AS POSSIBLE AND TO TRY TO REALLY GET YOU GOING BY USING PRESETS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
WE WANT TO HAND OFF BECAUSE HE'S HEADING TO THE OUTSIDE NOT OFF TACKLE NOT TO THE SIX HOLE BUT HE'S GOING TO THE EIGHT HOLE OUTSIDE AND TRY TO TURN IT UP FIELD AFTER HE TAKES THE HAND OFF
I TRY TO KEEP HIM AWAY
AND I ALWAYS TRY AND DO IT WHERE THE NEXT LEAF IS AND THAT WAY IT WILL FILL IN TOGETHER ALL TOGETHER
AND TRY TO DEFINITELY IF YOU CAN STAY ON KEY THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
I WOULD JUST TRY TO EMULATE THE SINGERS THAT YOU REALLY LIKE AND TRY TO SING LIKE THEM
AND WE'LL TRY OUT THE SIZE
I WANT YOU TO TRY AND KEEP THAT GOING AS FLUIDLY AS POSSIBLE RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT
YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TRY TO PRE-WET THE AREA LIKE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE
BECAUSE IF YOU TRY TO HIT SOME HEROIC SHOT OUT OF THIS SITUATION A LOT OF TIMES YOU'RE GOING TO DIG THE HOLE WORSE
AND REMEMBER TRY AND CONCEPTUALIZE WHERE EVERYTHING IS LINING UP
AND AS I'M PLAYING WITH BEAT ONE ON THE KICK BEATS TWO AND FOUR ON THE SNARE AND 8TH NOTES ON THE HI-HAT I WANT YOU TO BE THINKING TRY AND CONCEPTUALIZE WHERE THINGS ARE LINING UP WHICH LIMBS ARE GOING TO BE LINING UP WITH EACH OTHER AND ON WHICH BEAT ALL RIGHT
OKAY LET'S GO AHEAD AND TRY THE OTHER SIDE
SO TRY TO WEAR PLASTIC LENSES OR GO TO TWO PAIR OF GLASSES AND YOU TAKE ONE PAIR OFF
SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL TRY TO GO AROUND YOU WHEN YOU ARE PARALLEL PARKING AND NOT REALIZING THAT YOUR FRONT END IS GOING TO SWING OUT
SO TRY THAT NEXT REP LET'S SAY YOU GIVE YOURSELF TEN SECONDS REST TRY THAT NEXT REP FOR TWENTY SECONDS
TRY THAT FOR LET'S SAY THIRTY SECONDS
AND TRY TO HIT IT THERE REALLY GOOD
