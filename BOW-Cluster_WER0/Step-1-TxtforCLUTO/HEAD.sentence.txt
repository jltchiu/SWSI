BALL COMES OUT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEY DON'T GET THE FOUL CALLED BECAUSE THE PLAYER THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO BOX OUT IS EASILY ABLE TO GET THE REBOUND
IF YOU'RE IN THE OCEAN AND YOU SEE A BIG SURF AND YOU SEE IT FROM THE BEACH AND IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S HEAD IT'S RUNNING ABOUT HEAD HIGH THERE
IF IT LOOKS OVER THEIR HEAD IT COULD BE DOUBLED OVER HEAD SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY TO DESCRIBE IT
THEN COME UP ONTO THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD
NOW LIFT THE HEAD NECK AND SHOULDERS OFF THE FLOOR AND BRING THE HANDS UP AS WELL
SO AS THIS HAND COMES OUT FROM THIS POSITION THE HANDS GO OPEN HEAD TURNS FORWARD AND PALMS ARE UP
OKAY NOW START HERE WITH YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD UNTIL YOU'VE GOT YOUR BODY TOTALLY ADJUSTED
WATCH THAT CLUB HEAD
AND THEN RELEASE TO THE FLOOR AND TURN THE HEAD TO ONE SIDE AGAIN RESTING
YOU CAN DESCRIBE A WAVE FROM BEING ANKLE TO HEAD HIGH AS WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS MAYBE ONE FOUR FOOT
SO I GOT ONE IN THE HEAD WITH A BATTLE RIFLE
INHALE BREATHE IN FROM THE TAIL BONE ALL THE WAY UP TO THE CROWN OF THE HEAD AND AS YOU BREATHE OUT DROP DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE INTO THE STRETCH
FROM THIS POSITION EVERY TIME YOU TAKE A BREATH IN AND REMEMBER THAT THREE PART BREATH BREATHING FROM THE BELLY ALL THE WAY UP TO THE COLLAR BONES ON THE INHALE THAT'S GOING TO LENGTHEN YOU FROM THE TAIL BONE ALL THE WAY UP TO THE CROWN OF THE HEAD
OK NOW THAT WE HAVE THE HEAD STITCHED AROUND IN THE SHOULDERS WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PUT IN OUR ARMS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE READY AND STUFFED
SO SEE IF YOU CAN LET THE TAILBONE DROP REACH THROUGH THE CROWN OF THE HEAD ROLL THE SHOULDERS OPEN AND BACK AND THE FEET PRESS INTO THE FLOOR
IF IT FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE TO HOLD ONTO THE EDGES OF THE CHAIR THAT'S FINE OR YOU CAN RELAX THE HANDS ON THE THIGHS AND CLOSE THE EYES AND JUST PICTURE STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY AND JUST ROLL THE SHOULDERS OPEN REACH THROUGH THE CROWN OF THE HEAD AND REMEMBER YOUR THREE-PART BREATH FROM THE BELLY THROUGH THE RIBS UP TO THE TOPS OF THE LUNGS
ONCE YOU'VE MADE THAT CIRCLE AT THE TOP YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A SMALLER HALF-CIRCLE AND THAT IS GOING TO BE THE HEAD OF YOUR LADYBUG
AND NUMBER SEVEN IF YOU TURN IT OVER BEFORE THAT CLUB HEAD HITS THE BALL YOU'RE GOING TO HOOK
SO SOME VARIATIONS ARE YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOU ADD A CRESCENT KICK WHERE THE KICK COMES UP AND IT COMES OUT SLAPPING ON THE SIDE THE SIDE OF THE HEAD
RIGHT NOW THE HORSE HAS ITS HEAD TURNED TO HER
IF THE RIDER WALKS UP QUIETLY AND SLOWLY TOWARDS THE HORSE'S HEAD AND THEN PUTS THAT SECRET ROPE FROM AROUND HER WAIST AROUND THE HORSE'S NECK IT LOOKS LIKE WE MADE A CLEAN CATCH
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INTERMEDIATE FLOOR GYMNASTICS AND WE'VE COVERED OUR STRETCHING AND OUR WARM-UPS TO AVOID INJURY AND THE NEXT THING I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WAS WAS YOUR YOUR BODY POSITIONS MAINLY YOUR HEAD POSITION
YOUR HEAD IS REALLY THE KEY TO WHERE THE REST OF YOUR BODY IS GOING
WHATEVER YOUR HEAD IS DOING REALLY DETERMINES WHAT THE REST OF YOUR BODY WILL BE DOING
SO I JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU SOME OF THE BASIC SKILLS AND WHERE YOUR HEAD POSITION IS ON THOSE SKILLS
SO BASICALLY WE ARE GOING TO LAY FLAT ON OUR BACKS ONCE AGAIN OUR HANDS ARE BEHIND OUR HEAD ELBOWS ARE BACK SHIN IS UP
SOCCER KICK THE HEAD IF THAT'S STILL BENT ARM LOCK YOU COULD DO A KNEELING BENT ARM LOCK RIGHT THERE THAT'S A GREAT ONE
WHAT I CAN DO FROM HERE I'M JUST GOING TO WALK MY FEET OUT TOWARDS THE DIRECTION OF HIS HEAD POINTING TO LOCK UP A TIGHT CHOKE
AND WHEN I'M DONE WITH THAT SIDE I'LL STAY THERE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES BUT WHEN I'M DONE I'LL LET GO RELEASE MY HEAD UP MY ARM OUT AND AROUND COMING BACK DOWN
ALSO IF YOU ARE IN THIS CLOSE SOMETHING THAT YOU MAY LET YOU DO IN MORE PRACTICAL SPARRING THEY MAY LET YOU USE ELBOWS CONTROLLED THOUGH YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO USE ELBOWS TO THE HEAD YOU CAN USE KNEES AND TAKE OUT LOW
THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT WITH IT AS YOU TRYING TO MOVE ALONG THE HEAD
DOWN THE ENTIRE BODY TAKE THE HANDS UP INTO THE HAIR MASSAGE THE HEAD JUST A LITTLE BIT
ULTIMATELY YOU JUST WANT TO LET THE HEAD RELAX AND LET THE BODY RELAX AND LET THE PRESSURE FEEL GOOD
THAT'S IT AND THEN IN THE NEXT SEGMENT WE'LL BE WORKING ON THE HEAD NECK AND SHOULDER AREA
CAN YOU PUT YOUR HEAD BACK MORE PLEASE
AND AS YOU CAN SEE KYLE'S CHIN IS A LITTLE BIT FORWARD SO WE'RE GOING TO ASK HIM TO PUT HIS HEAD BACK A LITTLE BIT MORE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT
SUPPORTING THEIR HEAD WITH YOUR SHOULDER AND THEN ASKING THEM ALSO TO PUT THEIR BELLY BUTTON UP IN THE SKY
IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET A SNAP AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR RACKET HEAD IS COMING AROUND EFFICIENTLY TO GO INTO YOUR SPENCER YOUR FLAT SERVE WHATEVER YOU MAY USE
AND NOW WE'LL DO THE HEAD
YOU HOLD THE KITTY'S HEAD THIS WAY AND HE IS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO TURN AROUND AND BITE YOU
SO WHAT I DO SUGGEST IS THAT WITH THIS THERE'S FOUR SCREWS USE YOUR PHILLIP'S HEAD SCREWDRIVER AND SIMPLY REMOVE THAT FROM THE DOOR
AND WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS GET A TEMPO IN YOUR HEAD AS EVEN AS POSSIBLE ONE TWO AND JUST PLAY EVERY STRING AND KEEP ALTERNATING YOUR FINGERS AND WORK ON GETTING A NICE BIG SOUND ON YOUR BASS
THE TARGET AREA IS FROM THE WAIST UP INCLUDING THE HEAD AND TO SCORE AS I SAID YOU MAKE CUTS TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF YOUR OPPONENT'S TARGET OKAY
SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS PUT IT UP TO THE NEAREST LEGAL LIMIT THAT YOU CAN WHICH IS RIGHT UP ON THAT HEAD STREAM AS SO
THIS IS YOUR STANDARD FULL FACE HELMET IT IS SNELL APPROVED IT IS A COMPOSITE BLEND IT HAS A WONDERFUL VENTILATION SYSTEM IT IS VERY LIGHT IN WEIGHT AS YOU CAN SEE IT COVERS THE WHOLE HEAD
IT IS NOT SNELL APPROVED AND IT ONLY COVERS THE TOP PART OF YOUR HEAD
THESE ALL DO NOT COVER THE WHOLE CIRCUMFERENCE OF YOUR FACE SO ALWAYS CONSIDER THAT YOU CANNOT PICK WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO HIT YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU FALL
TIGHTEN THIS TO A GOOD TORK I'M GOING TO TIGHTEN UP THE OTHER HEAD SO NOW I HAVE MY GRIPS INSTALL AND I'M READY TO SET UP MY BRAKE LEVER
ROUNDING OUT THE UPPER BACK KEEPING THE LOWER BACK STRAIGHT COLLAPSING THE CHEST IN HEAD INTO MY ARMS AND I ALSO STRETCH OUT MY UPPER BODY AS WELL
THEN YOU WANT TO HAVE WHATS CALLED A HAIR LIGHT THAT WILL BE AIMED AT THE BACK OF THE MODELS HEAD SO THAT THEIR HAIR STANDS OUT FROM THE BACKGROUND AND SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THE DEPTH OF THEIR HEAD ACTUALLY
SO NOW I'M GOING TO TAKE MY LEFT THUMB RIGHT THUMB AND PRESS IT AGAINST THE WHEEL HEAD AND MOVE IT TOWARDS THE CLAY TO GIVE MYSELF AN UNDERCUT
PLACE MY COMB IN THE SIDE OF THE HEAD OR THE SIDE BACK OF THE HEAD AND SEE WHERE THE COMB STARTS TO COME OFF OF THE HEAD FOR ME
A HALF OF A HEAD OKAY
MAKE THE HEAD AND THEN THE STRAIGHT LINE FOR THE ARM AND COME BACK TO THE EDGE AND THEN MAKE A LITTLE CURVE FOR A SKIRT AND COME BACK DOWN
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO A FULL SQUAT SQUATTING ALL THE WAY DOWN THEN YOU'RE GOING TO PRESS STRAIGHT ABOVE YOUR HEAD THEN STAND UP WITH A STRAIGHT ARM
ANOTHER THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO TAKE YOUR HIPS AND ROLL THEM UP A LITTLE BIT OKAY UPPER BODY ARMS EXTENDED OVER YOUR HEAD HANDS TOGETHER EYES LOOKING AT THE HAND
OKAY IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO COVER REMOVING THE DRIVER'S SIDE SEATBELT FASTENERS AND BASICALLY THEY'RE FASTENED WITH TWO BOLTS AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE A SEVENTEEN MILLIMETER HEAD
WHEN YOU FINISH YOUR HAIR STYLE IT'S GREAT TO JUST TAKE THE SPRAY AND SPRAY IT OVER THE ENTIRE HEAD JUST TO MAKE SURE ALL THE LITTLE STRAY HAIRS STAY BACK
HAMMER STRIKE ONE BUMP THIS HAND GOES OUT TO THE SIDE OPPOSITE HAND COMES FORWARD OVER HER HEAD BENDING ELBOW
ELBOW BENDS THE HEAD TURNS TO MEET
SO WE HAVE SOME FUN LITTLE PARTY HATS AND THAT'S HEAD WEAR
AND YOU'RE GOING TO SLOWLY EXHALE KEEPING YOUR HEAD BACK AND YOU'RE GOING TO BED PRIMARILY AT THE WAIST TAKING THE WEIGHT DOWN TOWARDS YOUR SHINS
DROPPING THE CHEST OVER THE KNEES AND THE HEAD TOWARD THE SHIN
SO YOU WANT TO CREATE AS MUCH CLUB HEAD SPEED FOR THOSE HIGH HANDICAP PLAYERS WHO HAVE TROUBLE GETTING THE BALL UP IN THE AIR
SO FIRST THING IF I PUT THE KAYAK BLADE ON TOP OF MY HEAD AND I JUST ROTATE LIKE THIS SEE HOW I'M ACTUALLY USING MY STOMACH MUSCLES TO BRING THE BLADE BACK AND FORTH
THAT WAY YOUR BODY GETS A NICE AND YOUR FULL MUSCLES THERE IS BLOOD GOING TO EVERY PART OF THE MUSCLE FROM YOUR HEAD GOING DOWN THEN YOU PREVENT A LOT OF INJURIES FROM HAPPENING
AS YOU LEAN AWAY YOU WANT TO TURN VERY SLIGHTLY KEEPING THE HEAD IN A STRAIGHT LINE WITH YOUR FRONT SHOULDER
NOW WHEN YOU GO IN THE BALL YOU CAN STAY ON YOUR KNEES AND JUST BASICALLY BEND FORWARD ALWAYS THINKING OF A LINE SHINING THROUGH THE CROWN OF THE HEAD
SO JUST GO AHEAD AND DROP YOUR HEAD A LITTLE BIT RIGHT THERE
SO IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO MOVE HIS HEAD TO THE RIGHT
THIS HELPS GET SOME OF THE MIGRAINE HEADACHES THAT ALSO ARE IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD OR THE OXIPUT
I WANT TO TRY TO TOUCH MY HEAD TO HIS HEAD
SO WHEN WE'RE GOING TO DO HALF OF THAT SO WE'LL SWIM ONE THROUGH POP THE ELBOW UP AND MY HEAD UNDERNEATH REALLY TIGHT
NOW AT THIS POINT MY HEAD IS MY MOST IMPORTANT APPENDAGE HERE
BRING YOUR ARMS DOWN SUPPORT YOUR HEAD UPON YOUR FISTS YOUR HANDS ARE FLAT ON THE MAT
TAKE YOUR HANDS OVER HEAD AND WE ARE GOING TO REACH UP AND CRUNCH NICE AND SLOW
LOW FLOW SHOWER HEAD COME IN TWO DIFFERENT KINDS
YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT A LOW FLOW SHOWER HEAD
MANY SHOWER HEAD FIXTURE MADE PRIOR TO 1992 LACK ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND THEY ALSO ALLOW WATER FLOW UP TO FIVE GALLONS PER MINUTE
AND YOU CAN START THIS BY REMOVING THE PHILLIPS HEAD SCREWS WITH YOUR PHILLIPS HEAD SCREWDRIVER THAT ARE HOLDING IT IN
AND WHEN YOU CLOSE THE EYES LET THE EYELIDS BE HEAVY LET THE BOTTOM LID MEET THE UPPER LID AND LET THE EYES ROLL BACK IN THE HEAD AND FIND THAT NICE PEACEFUL TRANQUIL FEELING OF BEING RELAX
AND YOU'RE GOING TO DROP THE BALL SLIGHTLY BEHIND THE HEAD TO ABOUT NINETY DEGREES AND EXTEND UP
AND IF YOU USUALLY HAVE SOMETHING UNDER YOUR HEAD SO THAT YOUR CHIN STARTS IN A CHIN TUCK POSITION GO AHEAD AND REMOVE THAT NOW
BETTER REGULATIONS MANDATE THAT NEW SHOWER HEAD FLOW RATE CANNOT EXCEED MORE THAN 2.5 GALLONS PER MINUTE
I MEAN THAT YOU HAVE NOT SEWN THE FACE TO TOO MUCH OF THE HEAD
REMEMBER THAT EVEN IN THIS POSITION RIGHT WE WANT TO FEEL THIS SHOULDER BACK THIS SHOULDER FORWARD HEAD PRESSING UP
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR HEAD TURNED TO THE SIDE BUT YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO BE SPOTTING YOUR LANDING FOR THIS STEP
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GRAB THE BASE OF THE BODY AND THE PANTS TOGETHER AS WELL AS THE BACK OF THE NECK OF YOUR SCARECROW AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO PUT HIM IN YOUR CHAIR LET HIM SLIDE DOWN AND IF YOU HAVE HIM STUFFED PROPERLY HE'S JUST GOING TO STAND UP ON HIS OWN AND YOU HAVE YOUR HEAD PINNED ON SECURELY THAT'S GOING TO STAND UP AS WELL
SO I LIKE THEM TO MOVE A HEAD A LITTLE BIT WHILE THEY'RE MOVING TO THE SIDE
THAT WAY YOU WON'T BE IN OVER YOUR HEAD OR PICK UP TOO MUCH SPEED WITHOUT WANTING TO
BRING THE HANDS BACK TO PRAYER NEXT TO YOUR HEAD
YOU GO THROUGH A WHOLE BUSINESS PLAN IN YOUR HEAD AND YOU WRITE THINGS DOWN AND YOU HAVE A GREAT BUSINESS PLAN IN MIND AND HOW DO YOU TAKE IT FROM BEING ON PAPER TO ACTUALLY OPENING THE BUSINESS AND STARTING TO WORK
IF YOU USUALLY USE SOMETHING UNDER YOUR HEAD TO SUPPORT IT DON'T USE IT WITH THIS EXERCISE
SO WE NEED TO TAKE THOSE AND FLUSH THEM AWAY GET THEM OUT OF OUR HEAD AND REALIZE THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING
I'M GOING TO BE USING THAT FOR THE EYE SO YOU WANT TO GET IT AS SMALL AS YOU CAN BECAUSE THE FLAMINGO'S HEAD IS SO SMALL
SO LIFTING UP THROUGH THE BACK LIFTING THE CROWN OF THE HEAD NICE AND HIGH AND BREATHING
YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STRIKE WITH YOUR ARMS VERY EFFECTIVELY BUT I DO HAVE MY HEAD AND MY KNEES AVAILABLE SO GIVE HIM A HEADBUTT TO SOFTEN HIM UP
I WON SEVERAL MAJOR AWARDS FOR MY WORK WHICH ENABLED ME TO GET A JOB AS THE HEAD OF A DOCUMENTARY FILM UNIT FOR BELL HELICOPTER INTERNATIONAL IN TEHRAN IRAN
ONCE YOU YOU GOT ENOUGH SPEED COMING DOWN THE QUARTERS SLOW TO MEDIUM PACE YOU WANT TO HEAD UP THE RAMP
NOW THE FIRST COUPLE TIMES YOU PUT ON OR TAKE OFF YOUR WINTER HORSE BLANKET THIS IS RUDY HERE AND HE'S ALWAYS GOOD TO STAND BUT YOUR HORSE PROBABLY WON'T BE AND IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO FRIGHTEN THEM A LITTLE BIT WHEN SOMETHING GOES ON OVER THEIR EYES AND OVER THEIR HEAD
AND AS WE TILT THE HEAD UP WE'VE GOT TO SEE HOW MUCH HAIR WE HAVE HERE
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT COVERS THE FRONT PART OF YOUR HEAD
YOUR HELMET IS VERY IMPORTANT IT PROTECTS YOUR HEAD FROM ANYTHING THAT MAY GET IN THE WAY IT COULD BE YOUR OWN PADDLE AND IT HAS TO FIT PROPERLY SO RIGHT UNDER THE CHIN
NOW WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF BASICALLY TAKING THE SHOWER HEAD OFF
THE IMPORTANT THING WITH THE OVERHEAD PASS IS YOU WANT TO IT'S EXACTLY LIKE THE PASS IS CALLED YOU WANT TO COME OVER THE HEAD
SO WHEN YOU COME YOU WANT TO COME OVER THE HEAD COME DOWN STEP INTO THE PASS AND YOU SEE HOW MY HANDS ARE FACING MY MAN
SO YOU COME OVER THE HEAD AND WHEN YOU PASS IT JUST AS ANY OTHER PASS YOU WANT TO STEP INTO THE PASS
LET'S SAY YOU WANT TO BE A RED HEAD FOR A FEW MONTHS YOU CAN DEPOSIT-ONLY YOUR COLOR JUST USE A DEPOSIT-ONLY RED AND IT WILL FADE OFF
SO JUST A COUPLE THINGS OF YOU NEED TO REMEMBER MAKE SURE IN A HEAD FIRST ENTRY YOUR SHOULDERS OR YOUR HANDS ARE ABOVE YOUR SHOULDER MAKE SURE YOUR HANDS TOUCH FIRST AND FEET FIRST MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FEET TOUCH FIRST AND DON'T TWIST YOUR BODY
BEFORE WE GET STARTED LET'S GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOK AT OUR FASHIONABLE BED HEAD CURLING IRON
I'M LAURA GIBSON BEAUTY EXPERT AND I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT BED HEAD CURLING IRONS
SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND JUST SHOW YOU HOW YOU WOULD USE ANY OTHER BED HEAD CURLING IRON
AND THE HEEL CO-ORDINATES WITH THE SHOULDER MOVEMENTS AND THE HEAD AND THE EYES
THE OTHER MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF SAFETY GEAR FOR WHITEWATER CANOEING IS A HELMET AND IF YOU HAVE A GOOD HELMET THAT FITS YOUR HEAD WELL AND IT'LL STAY ON WELL IT'LL PROTECT YOUR HEAD FROM THOSE OCCASIONAL BUMPS ON ROCKS WHEN YOU FLIP OUT OF YOUR BOAT OR EVEN FROM YOUR T-GRIP IF IT HAPPENS TO ERRANTLY HIT YOU IN THE HEAD WHICH THEY DO OCCASIONALLY DO
THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF HELMETS UM THIS ONE'S FOR PEOPLE WITH A MORE ROUND HEAD UM THIS ONE GIVES YOU A LITTLE MORE PROTECTION IT HAS SOME EAR FLAPS AND IS PRETTY TOUGH
DAD IF YOU HAD DONE YOUR SHARE I WOULDN'T BE FREEZING FROM HEAD TO TOE
YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR HEAD AND EYES PERFECTLY ERECT AND BRING THE SHOTGUN TO THE FACE
THEIR TERRITORY GENERALLY ONLY COVERS A SMALL AREA FOR EXAMPLE A SMALL CORAL HEAD IN THE SAND BUT THEY WILL ATTACK ANYTHING THAT GETS TOO CLOSE TO IT INCLUDING FISH MUCH LARGER THAN ITSELF
A HEAD SHOULD NOT GO IN THE FIRE AND SO I'M GOING TO MOVE
WAYS OF TAPPING IN AND HELPING REMOVE BLOCKAGES THAT GET STUCK ALONG THESE PATHWAYS LIKE HIGHWAYS THAT TRAVERSE THE WHOLE LENGTH OF OUR BEING FROM OUR HEAD TO OUR TOE
TO GET OUT OF THIS BRING THE WEIGHTS DOWN DROP THE HIPS LIFT THE HEAD AND WALK YOURSELF BACK UP ON THE BALL
A HORSE THAT GETS USED TO THIS KNOWS IT'S THERE AND BAILEY WILL JUST KIND OF RUN AND KEEP HIS HEAD A LITTLE LOWER
THE REASON WHY IS IT GOES OVER THEIR HEAD BEHIND THEIR EARS AND OVER THEIR EYES
AND WHAT THAT DOES IS WHEN THEY ELEVATE THEIR HEAD IT PUTS PRESSURE ON IT AND BRINGS IT BACK DOWN
ON THE NEXT WE'RE GOING TO INHALE AND LENGTHEN WE'RE GOING TO SLIDE OUR ARMS DOWN THAT TRUST ISSUE GRABBING ON TO YOUR PARTNER'S UPPER ARM LIFT YOUR CHEST DROP YOUR HEAD BACK AND FLOWER YOUR LOTUS OPEN YOUR PETALS
NOT THE TOP OF THE HEAD NOT DOWN THE BOTTOM THIS IS A SIDEKICK
THEY HAVE VERY VERY LONG WHITE HAIR AND THEY'RE THE DOGS YOU'LL SEE VERY OFTEN THAT YOU KNOW HAVE A BARRETTE UP THERE AT THE TOP OF THEIR HEAD TO KEEP THEIR HAIR OFF THEIR EYES
AGAIN LET THE BOAT DO ALL THE WORK LET YOUR KNEES BEND AND YOUR ELBOWS RIDE IN AND OUT HEAD LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD
AND AS THEY DO YOU LET THEM RELAX AND ONCE YOU FEEL TENSION LIGHTEN UP UNDERNEATH YOU GOING TO LET THAT PERSON RELAX AND YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE THEIR HEAD BACK INTO POSITION AND YOU'RE GOING TO MAINTAIN THAT SAME PRESSURE IN THAT SAME SPOT AS YOU HOLD THAT HEAD UP
I'LL HOLD YOUR HEAD UP
AND WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS HAVE REYNA FLIP HER HEAD OVER FOR ME PLEASE
AND JUST DO THIS ALL OVER THE HEAD UNTIL IT GIVES YOU THAT NICE LITTLE WAVE
AND JUST THEN USE IT THIS WAY AND JUST PUSH IT ALL THE WAY TO YOUR HEAD
YOU CAN ALSO HAVE YOUR HEAD FLIPPED BACK ON THE CHAIR IF THAT IS EASIER FOR YOU
I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU FROM A STANDING POSITION ARMS ABOVE MY HEAD
SHE'S GOING TO LIFT WAY UP ON HER TOES AND BRING HER WEIGHT FORWARD CROWN OF THE HEAD FORWARD AND THEN BRING THIS STRAP RIGHT UNDERNEATH AND RIGHT ALONG THE BRA LINE
I LIKE TO USE A LITTLE WARM WATER IT IS NICE ON THE HANDS AND THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO NEED AND NOW WE ARE READY TO MOVE THE CLAY ON TO THE WHEEL HEAD AND GET IT CENTERED UP
ALRIGHT NOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO TURN YOUR WHEEL HEAD ON JUST A LITTLE BIT AND THEN PULL IT OFF TO THE LEFT ALRIGHT
IT ACTUALLY CAME FROM THIS SAME TYPE OF GEL FOOD COLORING AND WHAT I DID IS I THOUGHT IN MY HEAD OOH ALL I HAVE IS VANILLA AND I WANT TO SOME CUTE PINK CHOCOLATES AND SO I PUT ALL MY CHOCOLATES IN THERE AND COME DOWN HERE AND I'M GOING TO FILL UP THE REST OF THESE
WHEN THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING DOWN ON PAPER AND THERE'S NOTHING BUT YOUR IDEAS IN YOUR HEAD AND YOU'RE STARING AT THE PAGE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT TO MAKE YOUR IDEAS A REALITY OR MAYBE YOU JUST FEEL LIKE GOOFING AROUND AND JUST SKETCHING AND SEEING WHAT IDEAS FLOW FROM THE TIP OF YOUR PEN ON TO THE PAGE
SO GO A HEAD AND START WITH A STRAIGHT LINE TO DO YOUR PALM TREES
IF YOU JUST WANT TO STROKE IT OVER THE ENTIRE HEAD OF BRAIDS JUST TO GET IT TO GO DOWN IN THERE
IN THIS SEGMENT OF HOW TO CURE YOUR SLICE AND HIT A HOOK WE'RE GOING TO CONCERN OURSELVES WITH THE CLUB HEAD
BECAUSE IT'S THE CLUB HEAD THAT HITS THE BALL AND THE BALL KNOWS ALL AND THE ONLY THING THE BALL KNOWS IS IMPACT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THERE BUT IF YOU COULD WATCH THE CLUB HEAD AT HOME IN PRACTICE SWINGS IN YOUR BACKYARD
I'M WATCHING THE CLUB HEAD AND I KNOW WHAT I WANT THAT CLUB HEAD TO DO
BECAUSE IF THERE WAS A GLOBE DOWN HERE ON THE GROUND AND I WANTED TO SPIN THAT GLOBE IF I TOOK THAT CLUB HEAD AND I'M JUST WATCHING THE CLUB HEAD IF I BROUGHT THAT CLUB HEAD INSIDE AND SWUNG THAT CLUB HEAD OUT AND BEFORE I GOT TO THAT GLOBE I RELEASED OR TURNED IT OVER OR FLIPPED IT OVER
WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE DOGS HEAD LIKE A P IT IS GOING TO TIGHTEN AND LOOSEN INSTANTLY
YOU SHOULD ALSO FACTOR IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME YOU HAVE TO DEVOTE TO YOUR HOBBY AND DON'T GET IN OVER YOUR HEAD
ALL THE WAY UP DROPPING MY SHOULDER UNTIL I GET TO MY EAR AND THEN I'M GOING TO GENTLY REST MY HEAD ON MY SHOULDER THERE AND JUST GIVE A LITTLE TUG ON MY EAR TOWARDS THE GROUND
GUYS YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR HELMET IS ON NICE AND SNUG A FINGER OR TWO UNDER HERE IS GREAT MUCH MORE THAN THAT AND IT'LL JUST COME OFF YOUR HEAD AS YOU GO OVER BACKWARDS INTO THE RIVER
FIRST THING YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR CRADLE IS GOING TO SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF YOUR HEAD
THIS PARTICULAR STYLE OF SCARF IS REALLY LONG AND IT STRETCHES OUT QUITE A WAYS WHICH IS NEAT IF YOU WANT TO WRAP IT AROUND THE HEAD MULTIPLE TIMES IF YOU'VE GOT SOME SORT OF MOISTURIZER YOU'RE WORKING WITH TO REALLY SATURATE AND HOLD EVERYTHING IN
HOPEFULLY NOT SMASHING EACH OTHER'S HEAD IN THE CENTER
SO WE DROP OUR HANDS AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS FOLLOW THE UPPER HAND WITH OUR EYES AND ACTUALLY TURN OUR HEAD IN THE SAME DIRECTION
SO A REALLY GOOD STRETCH IS TO REACH YOUR HANDS UP WAY OVER YOUR HEAD AND TO JUST LEAN TO ONE SIDE
YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO BE CAREFUL AND WRAP THE TOWEL AROUND IT LIKE I JUST DID SO YOU DO NOT BURN YOURSELF MAYBE FLOW A LITTLE WATER THROUGH THE PORTER FILTER IN THE GROUP HEAD
LIKE A BROOM HEAD ON THE FAR END IT'S TALL IT'S HEAVY ON THE FAR END
WHAT WE'LL DO NOW IS BRING IT IN AND WE WANT TO CATCH IT RIGHT HERE BETWEEN THE HEAD AND THE BODY WITH A STAPLE
YOU HAVE TO YOUR HEAD ON STRAIGHT
KEEP YOUR BODY IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION SHOULDERS BACK HEAD UP BACK NICE AND STRAIGHT
IT'S LIKE 110 115 DEGREES AND WE HAD TO COVER OUR HEAD AND COOK BUT THE FOOD WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT
I HAD TO COVER MY HEAD
NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ONE OF OUR SMALLER FLAT HEAD BRUSHES AND WE'RE GOING TO APPLY SOME BURNT UMBER TO THE TOP OF IT
EXTENDING HER TAILBONE RIGHT DOWN INTO THE EARTH AND THEN LENGTHENING UP TO THE CROWN OF THE HEAD INHALING IN AND THEN AS SHE EXHALES SHE ROTATES INTO THAT LENGTH JUST A LITTLE BIT DEEPER
THE WAY THAT I WILL TEST THAT RIGHT NOW IS BY TURNING ON THE GROUP HEAD AND LET WATER FLOW THROUGH HERE I WILL TAKE MY THERMOMETER
AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO INHALE AND LENGTHEN REACH YOUR TAIL BONE BACK AS YOU REACH THE CROWN OF YOUR HEAD FORWARD AND THEN EXHALE TRY TO SINK DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT DEEPER
EXTENDING WITH THE TOES AND AGAIN IF YOUR NECK BOTHERS YOU BRING YOUR HEAD DOWN
BUT IT WON'T WORK AS DEEPER INTO THE BACK AND ABDOMINAL MUSCLES AS IT IS WHEN YOU LIFT THE HEAD UP
AND THE FACT THAT IN MANY CASES BIRDS ARE OVER YOUR HEAD
PULL IT OFF OVER HIS HEAD AND I STILL HAVE A HOLD OF HIM
IF YOU DO ANY TYPE OF ENTRY AND IT'S HEAD FIRST AND YOUR ARMS ARE BELOW YOUR SHOULDER LINE THEY'RE GOING TO DEDUCT POINTS
MY RIGHT HAND COMES OVER MY HEAD THIS WAY
SO WHAT WE LIKE TO ASK THEM TO DO IS WE LIKE TO ASK THEM TO PUT THEIR HEAD BACK LOOKING UP AT THE SKY
YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO KEEP A STRAIGHT LINE FROM THE CROWN OF YOUR HEAD THROUGH YOUR SITZ BONES SO COME INTO TABLE TOP AND COW HAPPENS WHEN YOU SPIN THE SITZ BONES UP TOWARD THE CEILING DROP THE BELLY AND GENTLY RAISE THE HEART
TAKE A BREATH PUT YOUR HEAD BACK IN THE WATER
WHILE YOU'RE DOING THIS IT'S KIND OF TRICKY PROCESS BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO UP YOU NEED TO LOOK FOR THE COPING WITH YOUR HEAD TURNED
SO IF YOU TOOK YOUR HEAD AND JUST SLIGHTLY TURNED IT JUST ONE WAY BREATHE PUT IT BACK IT BREATHE
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE HEAD OF COURSE BUT SHE'S HIT ANYWAY
IN THIS CASE EMMA BEGINS PREPARING HER ATTACK AND AS SHE DOES SHE IS HIT IN THE HEAD
NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO HEAD AND DO OUR PALM TREES
WITH NINETY POUNDS OF PRESSURE WITH A CHILD THAT CANNOT HOLD THEIR HEAD UP YET
NOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I'M NOT SURE I'D WANT MY CHILD'S HEAD TO BE PULLED
THIS IS A GREAT POINT FOR TREATING OVERALL FOR THE WHOLE HEAD SO NO MATTER WHERE THE PAIN IS ORIGINATING JUST GIVING IT SOME LIGHT OR DEEP MASSAGE CAN BE VERY HELPFUL
THEN FOLLOW IT UP WITH THIS OVER THE WHOLE HEAD
BASICALLY WHAT IT IS IS THEY'RE HELD IN WITH A TEN MILLIMETER BOLT WITH A SEVENTEEN MILLIMETER HEAD AND THEY HAVE A WASHER ON THEM A LOCK WASHER AND THEN A SPACER BUSHING
AND WHEN YOU GO DOWN YOU HOLD THAT POSITION SO THE MUSCLES ARE LEARNING TO SUPPORT THE HEAD IN THE PROPER POSTURE FOR EVEN STANDING AND SITTING IN THE OFFICE
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING WHEN YOU LOWER YOUR HEAD IN THIS WAY IS THAT YOU'RE LENGTHENING THE MUSCLES IN YOUR NECK RATHER THAN AND TEACHING YOUR HEAD HOW TO FALL FORWARD RATHER THAN INCREASING THE LENGTH IN YOUR SPINE
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE HEAD NOD
I'M GOING TO KIND OF JUST I'M JUST KIND OF MASSAGING THE HEAD OF THE BRUSH HERE TO JUST IF THERE'S ANY LOOSE BRISTLES KIND OF PULL THEM OUT
SO THAT'S FIRST AND AFTER YOU'VE WORKED FROM HEAD NECK TO SHOULDERS YOU'RE READY TO START INCORPORATING SOME OF THAT LOWER BODY ON THE OTHER HALF OF THAT CENTER OF GRAVITY
WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO A NOSE BRIDGE AND THEN YOU'LL NOTICE THAT IT'S SLIGHTLY HEAD CURVES UP
SO TAKE YOUR BIGGEST FLAT HEAD BRUSH AND APPLY A LOT OF THIS LIGHT BLUE TO IT
SOME PEOPLE IF THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WHERE THEIR NECK BOTHERS THEM CAN LAY THE HEAD DOWN
PUSH FORWARD TO CONNECT DEEPER INTO THE BACK AND THE ABDOMINALS HOLD YOUR HEAD UP
I MEAN EVEN UP IN HERE WE HAVE A PILATES A PILATES MAT OR A YOGA MAT AND ANYTHING THAT AT LEAST GIVES YOU SOME INSTALLATION AGAINST HARD FLOOR AND YOU COULD DO LIKE SIMPLES EXERCISES JUST TO INCREASE THE FLOW AND CIRCULATION FOR YOUR BODY AND THAT WOULD ELIMINATE THE SENSE OF FATIGUE OR APATHY OR LETHARGY BECAUSE YOU ARE INCREASING OXYGEN FLOW ESPECIALLY TO YOUR HEAD AND TO YOUR WHOLE BODY
ENERGY EXTENDS OUT THE CROWN OF THE HEAD AND IT'S WHITE LIGHT
AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PROCEED TO GO AROUND LIKE THIS HALF THE HEAD FROM THE EAR TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEAD THIS WAY
AND MAKE SURE YOU STAY CENTERED AS YOU GO ALONG THE HEAD WITH MORE BRAIDS IT JUST BECOMES THAT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO REMAIN CENTERED LIKE THIS
I'M GETTING READY TO HEAD OUT INTO THE WILDERNESS TO TEACH YOU HOW TO SURVIVE IN THE OUTDOORS
JUST TO THROW ANYWHERE ON THE HEAD THAT YOU WANT TO
SINCE I HAVE THESE TURNING BRAIDS RIGHT HERE WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO START THE BRAID AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEAD AND BRING IT AROUND JUST TO KIND OF FIT INTO THIS CORNER THAT I'VE CREATED
YOU WANT TO GET YOUR BLOWPIPE ADJUSTED EITHER BY A SHORTER ONE OR A LONGER ONE OR THEY DO MAKE ADJUSTABLE ONES BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE YOU KNOW CROOKING YOUR HEAD IN THERE TO GET TO THE BLOWPIPE OR YOU DON'T WANT IT WAY BACK YOU KNOW AGAINST THERE
NOW ALSO THERE'S GOING TO BE A TENDENCY FOR THE SHOULDER TO COLLAPSE SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SHOULDER IS PULLED BACK THAT THE CHEST IS OPEN THE HEAD IS GOING TO BE ALIGNED WITH THE REST OF THE SPINE
IT ALSO WORKS IF YOU HAVE A PERSON YOU'RE BEHIND HIM YOU WANT TO HAVE A NICE TIGHT GRIP OF THAT HEAD YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO PULL THE NECK BACK AND THE HEAD BACK SO WHEN YOU HIT YOU HIT OVER THE NOSE THE RIDGE OF THE NOSE
THEN THERE ARE SOME POINTS PARTICULARLY IF THE MIGRAINE IS GOING TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD ABOVE THE EAR
LET OUT ANY TENSION IN THE HEAD
WE GO TO THE HEAD AND TREAT SOME LOCATIONS
AND YOU CAN HEAT UP LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE PORTER FILTER A LITTLE BIT FASTER BY FLOWING A LITTLE BIT OF WATER THROUGH THE PORTER FILTER AND THAT WILL GET IT UP TO THE SAME TEMPERATURE AS THE GROUP HEAD
AND OF COURSE WITH THAT WE HAVE YOUR PORTER FILTER AGAIN THIS IS THE GROUP HEAD
EGGS HATCHED IN A FEW DAYS AND THE FRY DRIFT WITH THE CURRENT UNTIL THEY ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO TAKE UP RESIDENCE ON THEIR OWN CORAL HEAD
SO YOU ALWAYS COUNT EITHER ONE THREE FIVE OR SEVEN IN YOUR HEAD WHATEVER YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH BECAUSE EVERYONE'S LUNGS WORK DIFFERENTLY AND YOU'VE GOT TO BUILD UP TOWARDS IT
SO YOU CAN HIT IT WITH THE TIP OF THE STICK THE HEAD OF THE STICK
AND WHEN YOU DO END UP PULLING YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP FOR AIR AND THAT'S WHEN YOU'LL TAKE YOUR BREATH IF YOU NEED IT IT'S UP TO YOU BUT YOU'LL TAKE YOUR BREATH FOR AIR AND THEN YOU'LL PUT YOUR HEAD BACK IN THE WATER AND GO AGAIN
MAKE SURE NOT TO CUT HIS HEAD OFF
JUST KIND OF WORK YOUR THUMBS AROUND THE SIDE OF HER HEAD TO PULL A LITTLE BIT OF HAIR DOWN
AND THEN IF THEY START TO RESPOND IN A WAY TO LET YOU KNOW THEY ARE NOT ENJOYING THE WAY SHIKU DID JUST NOW WHEN HE LIFTED HIS HEAD AND KIND OF LOOKED AT ME BACK OFF ON IT
SO THE NEXT TIME YOU GO STROLL THROUGH THE BEAUTY STORE OR WHEREVER YOU MAY BE GO AHEAD AND PICKUP THAT BED HEAD TOOL IT'LL ONLY MAKE YOU COOL
GOOD NOW STRETCH YOUR LEFT ARM OVER YOUR HEAD AND DRAW THE LEFT SHOULDER BACK DRAW THE RIGHT SHOULDER BACK AND OPEN UP THE POSE TURNING YOUR HEART TOWARD THE SKY
AS THE LEFT LEG BENDS DEEPLY TAKE THE FOREARM TO THE THIGH THE RIGHT HAND TO THE HIP DEEPEN YOUR BREATH AND THEN SWEEP YOUR RIGHT ARM UP AND OVER YOUR HEAD
SO WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL START BY DRAWING SORT OF THE OUTLINE OF HIS HEAD AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO ACTUALLY IS I'M GOING TO KIND OF GIVE THIS GUY THE BODY OF A RHINOCEROS BECAUSE IN MY MIND THE BEETLES ARE KIND OF THE RHINOS OF THE LITTLE BUG COMMUNITY
THEY HAVE A SLENDER ELONGATED HEAD WITH A VERY SMALL MOUTH
THIS ONE HAS GOT A NOT A FLUID HEAD BUT IT TRIES TO HAVE A FLUID HEAD
THE NEXT THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE PROPER HEAD ALIGNMENT WHEN YOU'RE LAYING DOWN ON THE MAT
SO YOU'RE GOING TO BRING IT UP TO THE BASE OF THE HEAD BRING IT DOWN
SAME THING AS WE DID WITH THE TAIL DO A CRIMP FOLD WITH THE BASE OF THE HEAD SWIVEL FOLDS ON BOTH SIDES
TURN YOUR UNIT TO THE OTHER SIDE AND WE ARE GOING TO DO A CRIMP FOLD WITH THE HEAD AS WELL SAME THING WITH THE TAIL
RELEASE THAT TOUCH THE FLOOR GUIDE THE FLOOR AWAY FROM YOU KNEES OUT TO THE SIDES OF THE MAT SIT BACK TOWARDS YOUR HEELS BRING YOUR HEAD RIGHT DOWN UPON YOUR FIST YOUR HANDS ALL FLAT IN THE MAT
WE HAVE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN WE JUST DID ELEVEN WHICH WAS THE REVERSE YOKOMEN TO THE SIDE OF THE HEAD AND TWELVE
HOPEFULLY KEYED THE HEAD UP A LITTLE BIT
I'M GOING TO TURN HERE CATCH HIM ON THE SIDE OF THE HEAD
SO HERE WE GO I CAME AROUND CARRIED THE BLADE DOWN TSUKI TO THE EYES STRIKING THE HEAD BACK DRIVING THE CENTER UP A LITTLE BIT
THAT WAY BY THE TIME YOU HEAR THE WORD SECONDS OUT AND YOU ONLY HAVE TEN SECONDS LEFT YOU'VE ALREADY HAD A HEAD START YOU'VE ALREADY PUT YOUR MOUTH PIECE INTO THE BOXER YOU'VE ALREADY GOT HIM READY TO GO
AND THEN I'LL REACH UP AND AROUND WITH MY OTHER ARM TO MY OTHER EAR TO DROPPING MY HEAD
I'M USING THE WEIGHT OF MY ARM TO PULL MY HEAD DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND I'M GOING TO REACH OUT AT AN ANGLE WITH THAT OTHER ARM
TAKE SOME DEEP BREATHS AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE YOU'LL RELEASE THE RIGHT ARM RELEASE THE LEFT ARM RELEASE THE HEAD AND JUST RELAX AND YOU SHOULD FEEL LIKE YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT TALLER
TO SET OUR BEVEL WE NEED TO TAKE AN ALLEN WRENCH AND LOOSEN THIS ALLEN HEAD SCREW IN THE BOTTOM
ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR DESIRED ANGLE SET YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TIGHTEN THAT ALLEN HEAD SCREW
HE KEEPS HIS HEAD BACK AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO US USE THE CURRENT OF MY BODY TO HELP PULL HIM ACROSS THE POOL AND HE'LL BE FLOATING BY HIMSELF
AND WITH JUST A STILL CAMERA UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO BE SHOOTING MOVIES THEN YOU REALLY DON'T NEED A FLUID HEAD
OTHER SIDE SAME THING KEEPS IT THERE DROP YOUR HEAD AND BEND IT ONE MORE TIME
JUST KIND OF AS A RECAP REMEMBER HOW IMPORTANT YOUR HEAD POSITION IS FOR EVERY SKILL
IF YOU'RE HAVING A HARD TIME COMPLETING ONE OF YOUR TUMBLING PASSES CORRECTLY REALLY GO BACK AND TRY AND AND FIGURE OUT WHERE YOUR HEAD IS GOING IN YOUR PASS AND YOU CAN WORK ON THAT IN YOUR MIND AND AND AND RETRY IT AGAIN WITH THE PROPER HEAD POSITION
I KNOW IT'S CALLED THE BACK TUCK BUT IN YOUR MIND YOU NEED TO BE THINKING AN UP TUCK SO KEEPING YOUR HEAD LEVEL WATCHING SOMETHING IN FRONT OF YOU TO ENSURE THAT YOU'RE KEEPING YOUR HEAD WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE
FOR ADVANCE BRAIDER'S YOU MAY BE ABLE TO APPLY THE SAME BRAIDS SKILL THAT YOU HAVE LEARN BY PRACTICING ON OTHER HEADS TO YOUR OWN HEAD
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU LEAVE ENOUGH ROOM AT THE NECKLINE FOR ALL THE CORNROWS TO FOLLOW SINCE IT IS THE MORE NARROW PART OF THE HEAD
I PREFER EITHER EAR AND FOLLOW THE CURVE OF MY HEAD SHAPE TAMPERING OFF AT THE NECK
SO SET UP IN THE REGULAR NOLLIE POSITION AND YOU'RE GOING TO TURN YOUR BODY AND HEAD IN THE BLINDSIDE POSITION OR BLINDSIDE DIRECTION
YOU SWING YOUR ARMS JUST SLIGHTLY BY TURNING THEM AND HEAD IN THE BACKSIDE DIRECTION
I KNOW THAT I WAS IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT SEVERAL TIMES AND DURING THOSE TIMES I WAS UNDER 24 HOURS SURVEILLANCE WITH 24 HOURS FLORESCENT LIGHTS OVER MY HEAD ONE HOUR RECREATION PERIOD A WEEK AND THAT RECREATION PERIOD PRETTY MUCH CONSISTED GOING TO A ROOM WHICH HAD NO RECREATION JUST A BIG TWO WAY WINDOW WHERE PEOPLE COULD WALK PAST AND LOOK AT YOU IN THE HOLE
THAT'S THE OVER THE OVER THE HEAD BLOCK AND STAFF
NOW TYPICALLY IN A HEAD SHOT SECTION LIKE THIS I'LL SHOOT OFF TWO OR THREE FRAMES JUST TO HELP GET THINGS ROLLING
SO AS A DRILL WATCH THE CLUB HEAD
NOW THE PROPER WAY TO DO AN ABDOMINAL CRUNCH IS NOT LIFTING THE HEAD BUT ROLLING THE HEAD
SO WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO IS WHEN YOU ARE HAVING A BALL YOUR SIZE MAKING SURE THAT THE THIGHS ARE PARALLEL TO THE FLOOR YOU'RE GOING TO ROLL INTO IT UNTIL THE HEAD IS PARALLEL TO THE FLOOR SO YOU HAVE THAT SUPPORT IT IS LIKE A PILLOW UNDER YOU
IF WE PRESS IT DOWN IT GIVES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE ROUNDED AFFECT ON THE TOP AND A FLATTER INSIDE WHICH WILL GO AGAINST THE UNDER BODY AND ALSO KEEP THE LIMBS HEAD AND TAIL ALL IN PLACE
YOU DON'T WANT TO PLACE A LOT OF WEIGHT ON YOUR HEAD SO YOUR HEAD IS BARELY TOUCHING
BRAIDING IT WITH DAMP WHILE IT'S DAMP USE A LITTLE BIT OF MOUSSE AND THIS COULD ENHANCE YOUR WAVE AND GIVE YOU A BEAUTIFUL BED HEAD LOOK IN THE MORNING
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHY AND HEAD SHOTS AND WE'RE GOING TO ESPECIALLY DISCUSS HOW DO WE LIGHT FOR PORTRAITURE AND HEAD SHOTS
WHAT I LIKE TO SAY TO THE STUDENTS IS THINK OF A BASE OF A TRIANGLE AND YOU WANT TO GET THE BALL RIGHT OVER YOUR HEAD TO THE A PASS
IT IS PRETTY EASY TO GET YOUR HEAD AROUND
KEEP YOUR ARMS RELAXED THEY JUST KIND OF FLY UP OVER YOUR HEAD AND WHEREVER THEY LAND THERE'S FINE
AS THE HEAD STARTS TO COME OUT THE DOCTOR NOW CAN GRAB A HOLD OF THE HEAD
FORM IS REALLY IMPORTANT ON THIS ONE SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR HEAD AND YOUR SHOULDERS ARE ON THE BALL
AND THEN IN YOUR HEAD YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO COUNT
SO REALLY IF YOU WANT TO LEARN IT THE BEST TRY TO DO IT OUT OF THE WATER FIRST AND COUNT IN YOUR HEAD
WHEN YOU'RE DOING STRETCHES YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER THE SHOULDERS REACH UP OR ANY KIND OF POSTURAL WHERE YOUR HEAD IS OTHER THAN TO MAKE SURE IT'S STILL SUPPORTED SO THAT IT'S NOT IN AN EXTENDED POSITION
A REALLY GOOD ABDOMINAL STRETCH IS TO BRING YOUR ARMS OVER YOUR HEAD GO AHEAD AND POINT YOUR FEET STRETCH YOUR ARMS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AND STRETCH YOUR FEET
THE FIRST THING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS PUT YOUR HAND OVER YOUR HEAD OR AT LEAST OVER YOUR HEART
WE'RE GOING TO INHALE AND LENGTHEN UP AND THEN AS WE EXHALE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT LENGTH FROM THE HIPS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE CROWN OF THE HEAD FORWARD
PRETTY MUCH IT'S CALLED THE OVERHEAD BECAUSE YOU'RE BRINGING IT OVER YOUR HEAD
DRAPE A TOWEL OVER YOUR HEAD AND HOLD YOUR FACE OVER THE STEAM BEING CAREFUL NOT TO TOUCH THE POT
STICK IT ON THEIR HEAD
IF YOU'VE GONE OVER AND OVER IN YOUR HEAD WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO ALL THE WAY FROM YOUR BURNOUT TO YOUR STAGING YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN DO IT RIGHT IF YOU'VE DONE IT BEFORE AND YOU JUST REMEMBER AT THAT POINT THAT IF YOU LET YOURSELF DO IT THAT YOU'LL DO THE RIGHT THING
IN THIS HEAD OF HAIR RIGHT HERE YOU'LL NOTICE THAT HER HAIR AGAIN IT'S GOT THE WAVE AND IT'S STRAIGHT BUT SHE HAS A LITTLE FRIZZ IN IT IT IS DRY
SO IF YOU'RE WARM IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF RED IN YOUR HAIR IF YOU GRANDMOTHER WAS A RED HEAD YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO PUT RED ON YOUR HAIR
LET'S SAY YOU'RE DOING A FLIP AND YOU JUST HAPPEN TO SKIM THE WATER WITH YOUR FEET IT'S GOING TO BE CONSIDERED FAIL BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IT HEAD FIRST
SO IF YOU'RE DOING A HEAD FIRST ENTRY AND YOUR FEET TOUCH THE WATER
THE FIRST THING IS THIS IF YOU'RE DOING A HEAD FIRST ENTRY THAT MEANS YOU'RE HANDS NEED TO HIT THE WATER FIRST OK
ALSO ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THE ARMS IN A HEAD FIRST ENTRY IS THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABOVE THE SHOULDERS OK
FROM HERE TAKE A DEEP INHALE THROUGH THE NOSE START TO BRING YOUR CHIN TOWARD YOUR CHEST AND CURL JUST THE HEAD NECK AND SHOULDERS UP AND HOLD IT THERE
SO WHEN YOU ARE SETTING THE BALL TAKE THE BALL ABOVE YOUR HEAD WHERE IF YOU MISS THE BALL IT WILL HIT YOU IN YOUR FOREHEAD
BUT WE'RE COOLING DOWN HERE SO WE REALLY WANT TO RELAX OUR SIT BONES INTO THE MAT MAINTAINING NEUTRAL POSTURE NEUTRAL PELVIS AND SPINE LIFTING UP THROUGH THE TOP OF THE HEAD
UNSCREW THE HYDROGEN PEROXIDE POUR IT INTO THE CAP POUR IT INTO YOUR DOG'S MOUTH OPEN HER MOUTH POUR IT DOWN HER THROAT CLOSE HER MOUTH PET HER HEAD SO SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING'S OKAY
WELL THE MAIN POINT IN ALL OF YOUR SQUASH IS TO GET BACK TO THE TEE AREA RIGHT HERE SO WHEN I SERVE IF I SERVE AN OVER HEAD SERVE I WANT TO WATCH THE BALL AND I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE TEE
THE FIRST THING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS LEARN HOW TO FLOAT ON YOUR BACK BY SIMPLY PLACING YOUR HEAD BACK YOUR CHIN UP IN THE AIR PUTTING YOUR BELLY BUTTON UP AND JUST LETTING YOUR BODY FLOAT NATURALLY
NOW YOU HAVE THE OPTION OF PUTTING THE HANDS BEHIND THE HEAD
THIS ONE IS MY PFD DESIGNED FOR MY SIZE THIS IS A STYLE THAT YOU PUT ON OVER YOUR HEAD SO IT IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THEN THE OTHERS
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE WHEN YOU PUT A PFD ON THAT IT FITS YOU AND IF SOMEBODY PULLS IT PULLS YOU INTO A RAFT OR A CANOE THAT IT DOESN'T COME SLIDING UP OVER YOUR HEAD
THEY WOULD SLEEP WITH SOUP CANS AROUND THEIR HEAD WITH THEIR HAIR TURNED OUT THAT WAY
I CAN REMOVE MY HAND FROM HIS LOWER BACK AND THEN I CAN COME UP HERE AND FOCUS MORE ON HIS HEAD
THEN YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND LET HIM KNOW AND ALWAYS COMMUNICATE WITH THE CHILD WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO NEXT LET HIM KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND ASK HIM TO PUT HIS HEAD BACK AND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO REMOVE YOUR HAND FROM HIS LOWER HEAD OR THE LOWER NECK
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO PLANT THAT END OF THE PADDLE IN THE WATER I'M GOING TO LOCK MY NECK AND MY HEAD ON MY SHOULDERS SO WHEN MY NECK MOVES TO WATCH THAT PADDLE BLADE MY WHOLE BODY'S GOING TO MOVE
SO THE HEAD IS RELAXED AND THE ARMPIT IS RELAXED THE SPINE IS LONG MAKE SURE YOUR HIPS ARE STACKED AND INHALE IN
WELL FUSION HAIR EXTENSIONS ARE THE PROCESS OF BINDING YOUR OWN HAIR TO APPROXIMATELY 25 PIECES OF HUMAN HAIR CREATING ROWS THROUGHOUT YOUR HEAD TO CREATE A FULLER AND THICKER LOOK
WHAT IT DOES IS STEER THE HEAD
JUST COUNT IN YOUR HEAD AND JUST MOVE
BECAUSE THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE HARDER THINGS TO LEARN IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT BECAUSE IT'S ALL LIKE YOU'VE GOT TO COUNT IN YOUR HEAD
SO IN THE GAINER ONE AND A HALF ON THE TAKE OFF I WANT TO SEE HIM GET THE KNEES UP HIGH AND FAST OVER HIS HEAD
TILT YOUR HEAD THAT WAY
THINK OF PRESSING THE WEIGHT THROUGH YOUR BACK LITTLE TOE AND LET THE CROWN OF THE HEAD RISE
LIKE IN THIS ROOM WE'VE CLEARED OUT MOST EVERYTHING SO THAT IF I FALL OR I SLIP OR TRIP I'M NOT GOING TO HIT MY HEAD ON A CORNER OF A COUCH OR I'M NOT GOING TO KNOCK A WHOLE BUNCH OF BOOKS OFF A SHELF OR ANYTHING EVERYTHING IS PRETTY CLEAR
OR BASICALLY YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KEEP THE SHOULDERS FROM COMING UP KEEP THAT LINE SHINING ON THE CROWN OF THE HEAD EXHALE INHALE DO A FEEL YOU'LL FEEL THEM ALL ACROSS NOT ONLY THE SHOULDERS BUT ACROSS YOUR BODY
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BRING YOUR HAND DOWN BEHIND YOUR HEAD AND JUST STRETCH OUT THE TRICEPS AND THAT'S GREAT TO DO
I WANT YOU TO ROUND THOSE ARMS COMING UP HEAD UP CHIN TO THE CHEST KNEES TOES UP ROLL UP STRETCH FORWARD COME UP AND YOU CAN DO AS MANY OF THESE AS YOU LIKE COMING BACK DOWN YOU CAN DO TWENTY YOU CAN DO FIFTY IF YOU WANT OR YOU CAN JUST RELAX WHEN YOU GET TO THE FLOOR AND MOVE ON
IF YOU FIND THAT WHEN YOU'RE DOING A HIP ROLL THAT YOU'RE TAKING SOME TENSION IN YOUR NECK JUST GENTLY ROCK YOUR HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE
JUST REMIND YOUR HEAD THAT IT'S NOT AT ALL ATTACHED TO YOUR ABDOMINALS
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO MANIPULATE THE HEAD IN SUCH A WAY YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE YOUR THUMB WHERE IT IS AND ELEVATE THE HEAD SLIGHTLY
YOU'RE GOING TO ELEVATE THEIR HEAD AND YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE WHICHEVER HAND WE'LL USE THE LEFT FOR RIGHT NOW
FIRST ONE WE'RE GOING TO DO IS HEAD AND OUR NECK WHICH IS THE BOOGOLOO
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS JUST WATCH WE'RE GOING TO START WITH HEAD AND NECK FROM HEAD AND NECK WE'RE GOING TO MOVE DOWN FROM THE TORSO FROM THE TORSO WE'RE GOING DOWN THE LEGS AND DO QUADS IN OUR HAMSTRINGS
THEY HAVE A RELATIVELY SMALL TERRITORY THAT THEY PATROL AND RARELY RISE MORE THAN A FEW INCHES ABOVE THE SAFETY OF THEIR PATCH REEF OR CORAL HEAD
NOW BRING YOUR HEAD AROUND TO THE FRONT
I'M GOING TO BRING MY PADDLE TO THE SIDE I'M GOING TUCK FORWARD AND WHEN I'M TUCKED FORWARD MY HEAD IS PROTECTED WITH MY HELMET MY PFD PROTECTS MY BACK
THINK ABOUT THEM GETTING SUBMISSIVE WHEN WE WALK TOWARDS THE HEAD
NOW WE'LL DO THREE LITTLE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED HAND MOTIONS THREE LITTLE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED ONE FELL AND BUMPED HIS HEAD MOMMA CALLED THE DOCTOR AND THE DOCTOR SAID NO MORE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED
TWO LITTLE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED ONE FELL OFF AND BUMPED HIS HEAD MOMMA CALLED THE DOCTOR AND THE DOCTOR SAID NO MORE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED
ONE LITTLE MONKEY JUMPING ON THE BED HE JUMPED OFF AND BUMPED HIS HEAD MOMMA CALLED THE DOCTOR AND THE DOCTOR SAID NO MORE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED
SOME OTHER THINGS THAT YOU CAN PRACTICE IN THE POOL IS SIDING AND IN OPEN WATER SWIM EVERY SIX TO EIGHT STROKES YOU NEED TO CHOP THE STROKE SHORT AND STICK YOUR HEAD UP
WE START TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND WE CAN QUITE OFTEN HEAD PEOPLE OFF FROM HAVING FURTHER PROBLEMS
I GO A HEAD GET MY PAINT BRUSH WET GET MY BLACK I DO LIKE THE BLACK TO DO A PALM TREE JUST BECAUSE IT REALLY HAS A NICE CONTRAST WITH THE OTHER COLORS THAT I'M DOING
ON TOP OF THAT EXTENDING THROUGH THE CROWN OF THE HEAD WE HAVE THE CROWN
BUT I PERSONALLY THINK IF YOU CAN BUY SOMETHING FOR FIVE DOLLARS THAT IT KEEPS YOUR BABY FROM HITTING THEIR HEAD ON SOMETHING OR GETTING STITCHES AND THAT TO ME IS MONEY VERY WELL SPENT
THERE IS SOME KIND OF SHARP METAL EDGES ON IT AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN HE IS A OLDER TODDLER THAT HE WON'T HIT HIS HEAD AGAINST IT
IT JUST KIND OF KEEPS THAT FROM BEING ABLE TO BUMP THEIR HEAD ON THE FAUCET
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS DIRECTLY PUT THE MASK RIGHT ONTO HERE AND THEN OF COURSE THIS WOULD GO AROUND THE CHILD'S HEAD AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO JUST GO AHEAD AND BREATHE IN IT
AND YOU DO THIS BOTH WITH YOUR HEAD COVERING AND ON YOUR GLOVES
AND A FINE LITTLE TRICK WITH THIS IS TO ASK THE CHILD TO PUT THEIR HEAD BACK ALL THE WAY BACK ON THE NOODLE
FOR ONE TWO THREE KEEP YOUR HEAD BACK
AND HERE WE GO JUST BREATHE NICE AND EASY AND KEEP THAT HEAD BACK ALL THE WAY BACK
HEAD BACK HEAD BACK PUT THAT HEAD BACK SIR HEAD ALL THE WAY BACK
FIRST THING FLOAT HEAD
ALRIGHT THE FIRST BALL HANDLING DRILL I WANT TO SHOW YOU IS ONCE YOU HAVE THE BALL YOU WANT TO TAKE THE BALL BRING IT DOWN BELOW YOUR ANKLES START DOWN BELOW YOUR ANKLES AND GO AROUND YOUR ANKLE WAIST HEAD WAIST ANKLE WAIST HEAD WAIST ANKLE AND YOU JUST GO FASTER AND FASTER KIND OF LIKE THIS
DROP YOUR HEAD ALONG YOUR NECK AND BRING IT UP MOVING ON WITH THE NEXT ONE
THE ONE THING YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS TRY NOT TO LEAD THE MOVEMENT WITH THE HEAD BUT KEEP THE HEAD IN LINE WITH THE SPINE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN
LET'S DO A SAIIDI ARM BY YOUR HEAD AND THEN SWITCH
HE'S PULLING ME DOWN ONE TWO THREE FOUR PULLS THE BACK OF MY HEAD DOWN WITH A GOOD PULL
IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE AT HOME THAT CAN HELP YOU WITH THIS EXERCISE I CAN ACTUALLY APPLY PRESSURE UNTIL SHE FEELS THAT TENSION AND MAKES IT A LITTLE EASIER FOR HER AND THEN SHE CAN TELL ME WHEN SHE IS THERE AND THEN WE WOULD RELEASE AND THEN THE LAST STEP SHE WILL BE UP AND OVER HER HEAD AND SHE WILL DO THAT TRICEP STRETCH
SO A COUPLE OF KEY POINTERS TO REMEMBER IS YOU'VE GOT YOUR NINETY DEGREE ANGLES WITH YOUR LOWER BODY YOUR SHOULDERS AND YOUR HEAD NEED TO STAY ON THE BALL
WE DON'T WANT TO BE UP HERE WHERE YOUR LOWER BACK IS ON THE BALL AS YOU ARE PUSHING UP BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO BE PUTTING A LOT OF RESTRAINT IN YOUR NECK SO AS YOU ARE SETTING UP KEEP YOUR FREE WEIGHTS DOWN BY YOUR SIDE AND YOU ARE GOING TO COME FROM A SEATED POSITION TO ROLL YOURSELF ALL THE WAY DOWN UNTIL YOU FEEL YOUR HEAD AND YOUR SHOULDERS TOUCH THE BALL
WITH THE SHOULDER AND THE HEAD GESTURE
IT'S WHERE YOUR FOOT OR FEET GET CAUGHT IN THE RIVERBED THE WATER PILES UP ON YOUR BOTTOM BACK AND HEAD AND PUSHES YOU HEAD FIRST IN THE RIVER AND YOU STAY THERE
AND AGAIN I'M STILL CUT FROM THE BACKGROUND GOT A NICE CROWNING ON THE SHOULDERS AND THE HEAD BUT I'M STILL IN SHADOW
AND THEN JUST REMEMBER WHEN YOU'RE DRAWING IT THAT IT HAS THE FITTED PART AROUND THE HEAD THAT IS PULLED DOWN
RELAX YOUR SHOULDERS AND KEEP YOUR HEAD NICE AND LEVEL AND EXHALE AS YOU PUSH THE BALL AWAY FROM YOU
YOU CAN WRAP THEM AROUND THE HEAD BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE COTTON SCARF YOU REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE IT STAYS VERY TIGHT BECAUSE IF IT GETS TOO LOOSE IT WILL WORK AGAINST YOU AND JUST BE REALLY LOOSE AND RUBBING AGAINST YOUR BRAIDS CAUSING THEM TO FRIZZ UP AND COME APART A LOT FASTER
SO HE PULLED OUT OF HIS BACK POCKET A LITTLE GAUZE AND WRAPPED IT AROUND THE BIG SHARK'S HEAD AND THE TWO WENT OFF IN THE SUNSET AS FRIENDS FOREVERMORE
BECAUSE HE HAS A SHORT NECK HE HAS A TENDENCY TO ELEVATE HIS HEAD IN HIS TURNS
SIX IS THE ENGINE THE HEAD OF THE TRAIN
THIS IMPACT BAG IS REALLY GOING TO TEACH YOU THE HABIT OF COMING TO THE CORRECT IMPACT POSITION AND IF YOU NOTICE HERE MY WEIGHT IS WAILING TO MY LEFT SIDE THE CLUB FACE IS BEHIND MY HANDS SO MY HANDS ARE HEAD AND IN THIS POSITION I AM ABLE TO HIT DOWN ON THE BALL
ALEXA PUT YOUR HEAD BACK LIKE THAT THANK YOU
IF YOU NOTICE I AM NOT LETTING MY SHOULDERS DO THIS KEEP THE SHOULDERS DOWN CURL THE HEAD AND THEN YOU LIFT THEN YOU LOWER AND YOU UNCURL SO THAT IS THE PROPER TECHNIQUE FOR A ROLL UP
SO I'M EXTENDING OVER THE HEAD AND IN THIS ACTION HERE IS WHEN THE LATS ARE GOING TO KICK IN WHICH ARE THE LARGE MUSCLES OF THE BACK AND ALSO THE PECTORALIS MAJOR
WE'RE GOING OVER THE HEAD AND PULLING BACK OVER THE CHEST
AGAIN IN THIS POSITION YOU WANT TO LET GET YOUR HEAD RESTING ON THE BALL AND NOT LET YOUR HIPS SAG SO YOU'RE GOING TO USE THE GLUTES TO CONTRACT TO LIFT THE HIPS AND HAVE YOUR HEAD IN LINE WITH YOUR SPINE
KEEP ON THE WAY YOUR HANDS ON THE FLOOR BRING YOUR BODY TO THE RIGHT SIDE BREATH AND RELAX DROP YOUR HEAD
MY RIGHT FOOT AND RIGHT HAND GO TOGETHER CAT STANCE PUNCH CHAMBER THE HEAD SIDE STEP DODGE CAT STANCE PUNCH
MAKE SURE YOU GET IT UNDERNEATH THE HAIR PAYING AS MUCH ATTENTION TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD AS YOU PAY TO THE SIDES AND THE TOP
I'M GOING TO GIVE CARRIE HERE A NICE HEAD MASSAGE WITH THE SHAMPOO
SO SHE'S ONE LONG LINE OF ENERGY FROM THE CROWN OF HER HEAD ALL THE WAY DOWN TO HER TOES
BECAUSE THE SQUARE BOLT HEAD IS NOT SUPPOSED TO ROTATE
AND THAT COULD BE MADE INTO AN ARROW HEAD
WE WOULD TAKE THE REINS OVER HER HEAD AND WE ARE GOING TO COME AROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE AND RUN THE RIGHT STIRRUP UP
IT'S ALSO AN OPTION TO HAVE A STALL GUARD SO THAT YOUR HORSE IS ABLE TO STICK IT'S HEAD OUT AND THE VENTILATION IS IMPROVED
WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS YOU DON'T WANT TO BRING THE SHOTGUN HERE AND THEN BRING YOUR HEAD DOWN LIKE SO
WE'RE HERE EYES REVERSE YOKOMEN TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEAD
YOU'LL NEED SOME FELT OR SOME FUN FOAM TO CUT FOR THE HEAD AND FOR THE TAIL AND THE WINGS
EVERYTHING FROM ONE BLADE TO FOUR BLADES ON A SINGLE HEAD
SO COME ON DOWN AND YOU WANT TO JUST REST YOUR HEAD GENTLY ON YOUR ARM
IF IN THE TWIST AND A HEAD FIRST ENTRY YOU TWIST MORE THAN WHAT THEY CONSIDER NINETY DEGREES IF I'M DOING A HEAD FIRST ENTRY AND I SHOULD BE LANDING THIS WAY BUT I HAPPEN TO TWIST MY BODY MORE THAN NINETY DEGREES OK THEN THEY'RE GOING TO CONSIDER THAT A FAIL DIVE
THE SPINES STAYS IN NEUTRAL WHICH MEANS THE HEAD HAS TO STAY LIFTED
IF YOU LOSE YOUR BALANCE DURING ONE OF THESE CLIPS SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING TO YOURSELF IN YOUR HEAD
NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO FORM THE HEAD BY JUST OPENING THIS UP AND RABBIT EAR FOLDING THIS LIKE SO
NOW FOR THE TOP OF THE HEAD WE ARE GOING TO FOLD IT DOWN SO THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THE HEAD OF THE HORSE
SO WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT DOWN INTO THE HEAD INSTEAD OF THROUGH THE BACK OF THE EYE
SO FROM HERE I'VE GOT HIM PINNED HERE AND IF HE STARTS TO GET AWAY I CAN TRANSITION INTO A STRIKE TO A HEAD GRAB TO A KNEE DROP ANYTHING THAT I NEED IS RIGHT HERE AT MY FEET
BREATHING DRILLS FOR FREESTYLE ARE REALLY QUITE IMPORTANT TO HELP MAXIMIZE YOUR V02 CAPACITY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO KEEP THAT HEAD DOWN AND FOCUSED
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD FRAMING FOR A HEAD SHOT AND THAT'S CERTAINLY ADEQUATE BUT IT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE INTERESTING IF WE CAN JUST SHIFT HER SHOULDERS A LITTLE BIT
WE WANT TO ALSO SHOW HER FACE AND NOT MUCH MORE THAN THAT BUT WITHIN THAT FRAME THE NEXT THING THAT WE'LL REALLY DEAL WITH IS POSING AND THE POSES FOR A HEAD SHOT FOR A HEAD SHOT FOR AN ACTING OR A MODELING PORTFOLIO
WE HAVE GOOD FRAMING OF CAITLIN IN OUR FRAME AND THAT'S ABOUT PERFECT FOR A HEAD SHOT
MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO PLAY HERE GET HEAD SHOT BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A LOT OF COVER
NOW IF YOU WANTED TO YOU COULD USE COLORED MATCH STICKS MATCHES RATHER WHERE THE HEAD OF THE MATCH IS A DIFFERENT COLOR AND YOU CAN ALTERNATE THOSE COLORS
OKAY THE OTHER CONSIDERATION AND THIS IS WHERE MOST OF YOUR HEAT LOSS WILL COME FROM IS AROUND YOUR NECK AND FROM YOUR HEAD
SO YOUR HEAD COVERING AND AROUND YOUR NECK BECOME VERY VERY CRITICAL TO MAINTAIN YOUR BODY HEAT IN SUB ZERO TEMPERATURES
I LOWER MY SHOULDERS FIRST AND THEN I UNROLL MY HEAD
BECAUSE THE TOP SECTION IS JUST A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN THE TWO SECTIONS THAT WE HAD IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD I CAN JUST COMPLETELY DROP THIS SECTION DOWN AND COMB THE HAIR IN ITS NATURAL FALL
AGAIN I SEE WHERE MY GUIDE IS I SIMPLY LET THAT SLIP BETWEEN MY FINGERS AND THAT WOULD TOTALLY CUT THE BACK AND JUST TRIM IT WHERE WE HAVE A NICE HARD EDGE OR NICE HARD PERIMETER LINE BLUNT LINE FOR THE BACK OF THE HEAD
YOU CAN DO A HAMSTRING STRETCH FOR THE BACK OF YOUR LEGS LYING ON YOUR BACK AND BRINGING YOUR LEG OVER YOU HEAD
