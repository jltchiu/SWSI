NOW WHAT YOU'LL WANT TO DO IF YOU'RE HOSTING THE BACHELORETTE PARTY IS MAKE A LIST OF ITEMS THAT YOU WOULD COMMONLY FIND IN A PURSE AND MAYBE NOT SO COMMONLY FIND IN A PURSE AND ASSESS THEM EACH A POINT VALUE
SOME OF THESE EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THE BEST INCREASE IN VALUE IS THE 1973 BETSY CLARK FIRST SERIES

THERE ARE VERY TEMPORARY CONTEMPORARY CARPETS AND THERE ARE VERY TRADITIONAL CARPETS AND SO IF YOU GO TO EXTREMES OF DESIGN OR STYLE THEN YOU MAY LIMIT YOUR PROSPECTS AS FAR AS WHEN YOU GET INTO THE RESALE VALUE

SO IF THEY WERE TO HAVE AN APPRAISER COME BACK THROUGH WE COULD TRUTHFULLY TELL THEM HOW MUCH MORE VALUE THEIR HOUSE IS NOW AND WE'LL COMPARE IT TO WHAT WE SPENT WHICH WILL BE REALLY INTERESTING
IF WE COME OFF SPENDING WHICH I HOPE WE END UP SPENDING NO MORE THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ON THIS WE'LL SEE WHAT THE MARKET VALUE OF THIS IS IT'LL BE AN INTERESTING THING FOR US TO KNOW IN OUR BEAUTIFUL NASHVILLE AREA HERE
SO THE NOTATION VALUE LOOKS LIKE THIS
LETTUCE DOES NOT HAVE ANY NUTRITIONAL VALUE FOR TURTLES OR IGUANAS
NOW THE PEOPLE THAT RODE THESE BIKES IN THE THIRTIES FORTIES AND EARLY NINETEEN FIFTIES THEY'RE NOT INTO COLLECTING ANY BIKES RIGHT NOW SO THE VALUE ON THESE HAS DROPPED BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AS MUCH OF A DEMAND
THAT NUMBER IS GOING TO CHANGE GIVEN THE VALUE OF INTENSITY THAT THE WORKOUT IS
LINE ALSO AND I HOPE YOU CAN SEE THIS CAN BE USED TO CROSS HATCH AND CREATE MOVEMENT SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND FORM INSTEAD OF USING VALUE TO UNDERSTAND FORM
