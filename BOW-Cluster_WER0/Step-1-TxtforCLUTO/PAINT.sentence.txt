YOU MIGHT EVEN TAKE A SPONGE AND PUT IT IN YOUR PAINT AND MAKE SPONGE DESIGNS
IT'S HARD TO PAINT ON IT'S NOT GOING TO BE COMFORTABLE TO SIT ON
SOMETIMES THERE'S A LITTLE PIECE OF HARDENED PIGMENT IN THE PAINT BOTTLE ITSELF THAT COMES OUT IT MIGHT JUST BE THAT THE PAINT'S OLD
I'VE GOT THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE TOOLS YOU SEE ME ALMOST DROP IT IT'S CALLED A SQUEEGEE AND THIS IS A REALLY NEAT TOOL TO DO SOME REALLY COOL THINGS WITH PAINT INSTEAD OF USING A BRUSH
I'VE GOT SOME BASIC ACRYLIC PAINT HERE
WHETHER YOU HAVE KIDS OR A BUNCH OF PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF THIS DOOR IT'S GOING TO SEE ITS ABUSE AND THE PAINT AROUND IT WILL SEE ITS ABUSE
SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO BLOW ON THE PIECE TO GET THE EXCESS PAINT OFF BUT I FIND SOMETIMES THAT CREATES SOME DRIP MARKS SO I TEND TO JUST SHAKE THE PIECE OFF
SOME PEOPLE WILL DIP PIECES INTO A CLEAR GLAZE AND OTHER CHOOSE TO PAINT IT ON
I REALLY LIKE THE NON-ABRASIVENESS OF DIPPING BECAUSE REALLY YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING THE PIECES A WHOLE LOT AND WHEN YOU ARE PAINTING YOUR CLEAR GLAZE ON WHAT CAN HAPPEN IS AS SOON AS THE PIECE GETS WET YOU REACTIVATE THE PAINT AND WHEN A PAINT IS REACTIVATED IT'S VERY EASY FOR YOU TO START MOVING IT WHEN YOU ARE BRUSHING IT ON
WE ONLY DIP HALF A PIECE AT A TIME SO AS TO NOT DISTURB THE PAINT UNDERNEATH
IF YOU CAN AFFORD A NICE COAT OF WHITE PAINT IS ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA ALSO IF THE CARPETING IS VERY IMPORTANT TO VACUUM FOR INSTANCE THE CARPET ISN'T THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CARPET WE ALL AGREE I'M SURE YOU CAN HAVE IT LIFTED UP PUT SOME NEWER CARPET IN FOR MAYBE UNDER A $1 000 IF NOT YOU LEAVE IT AND MAKE IT CLEAN
DOES IT NEED PAINT
CHANTELLE TIBBS SAME PLACE YOU BUY THE FABRIC PAINT
IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO SKETCH DRAW PAINT DESIGN YOU HAVE MANY MANY OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU
SO WHETHER I'M SPACKLING CAULKING SCRAPING NO MATTER WHAT WHATEVER FALLS FROM UP TOP INCLUDING REAL THICK PAINT DROPS IT'S NOT GOING TO BLEED THROUGH
MY NAME IS SCOTT MCKAY AND TODAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO GET PAINTBALL PAINT OFF OF YOUR VEHICLE
WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS TWO KINDS OF PAINT
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A HIGHER END PAINT THAT'S USUALLY A WATER BASED A LOT THICKER THE EASE OF GETTING IT OFF IS GOING TO REALLY DEPEND ON HOW LONG IT'S BEEN ON THERE
THIS IS YOUR MORE GENERIC PAINT IT'S USUALLY A VEGETABLE BASE OIL
YOU COULD COVER YOUR TUBE WITH CRAFT A PAPER FIRST AND THEN PAINT AND DECORATE ON THE CRAFT PAPER
THEY USE THEY GET THIS BLUE TYPE OF PAINT
AND I CAN PAINT THIS PHOTOGRAPHIC EMULSION ONTO WATERCOLOR PAPER
NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW HOW TO PAINT THE STRAWBERRY WHICH I MADE FROM PLAIN MARZIPAN I MADE IT A DAY AGO IT IS STAYED OUT TO HARDEN UP
AND USUALLY WHEN WE ARE FINISHED WITH A PAINTING WE WILL GO AROUND AND CLEAN UP ALL THE EXCESS PAINT AROUND IT BECAUSE IF THE PAINT'S THERE IT'S GOING TO BE FIRED IN THE GLAZE
THIS LOOKS REALLY BAD BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF PAINT ON IT BUT IT STILL WORKS GREAT
AND YOU'LL PUT A LITTLE MORE PAINT TOWARDS THE END OF YOUR BRISTLES
THERE'S A SAYING IN PAINT IF YOU DROP YOUR BRUSH YOU BUY THE BEER
SO WHAT I'LL DO I'LL TAKE A LITTLE PAINT A LITTLE PINK PAINT AND I'M JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND GET THAT GOING REAL QUICKLY UP AND AROUND HER CUTICLES IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER THAT IT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT GETS UP THERE CLOSE TO THE CUTICLE AND STARTS THE LAYERING PROCESS
NOW THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS I'M GETTING SOME OF THOSE LITTLE BLOBBIES IN MY PAINT THAT HAPPENS ONCE IN A WHILE I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT CLEAN YOUR BRUSH AND START OVER GRAB ANOTHER LITTLE SPECK OF PAINT AND WE'LL KEEP GOING
SO I'M GOING TO APPLY THIS BASE PAINT OVER IT OVER THE MASKING TAPE AND THAT WILL HELP ME PLACE A NICE EVEN COAT OF COLORED PAINT ALONG THE PICTURE FRAME
THE GLASS IN MY RIGHT HAND CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS THE PAINT AND I'M DOING THE APPLYING OF THE PAINT OR THE HOT GLASS BELOW THE FLAME
NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT POURING UP OUR EXTERIOR PAINT
THE MEDIUM YOU PUT IN THE PAINT TO KEEP IT IN THE FABRIC DRIES PRETTY QUICK
YOU NEED TO HAVE THREE DIFFERENT BRUSHES WATER TO RINSE YOUR BRUSHES OUT OR ALCOHOL AND POSSIBLY ANOTHER TOWEL TO KEEP ALL THE PAINT ON
SUCH AS GREASY SURFACES OR DUSTY CHALKY SURFACES AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PAINT STICKS ONTO THOSE SURFACES
FINALLY WE HAVE THE PAINT
AND SO IT'S LITERALLY YOU'RE DIRTYING YOUR PAINT
IF YOU LOOK INTO THE NIGHT SKY AND YOU WANT TO PAINT A MOON AND STARS THAT'S TOTALLY POSSIBLE
SO WHEN YOU GET TO A STEP WHERE IT STARTS GETTING HARD TO PAINT SORRY THAT CHALK IN MY THROAT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S CHALK IN THIS
AND SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT WANT TO JUST TAKE YOUR FINGER AND JUST PULL THE PAINT BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT WILL DRY AROUND THE END OF THE NEEDLE
TAKE THE WATER GO OVER THE PAINT LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN PULL COLORS OUT
THE PAINTBALL GUNS THEY SHOT GREAT THEY SHOT REAL NICE AND IT DEPENDS ON THE BARREL IF YOU HAVE A GOOD BARREL IT'LL SHOT MORE ACCURATE OR NOT AND DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE PAINTBALL GUN AND EVERYTHING ON THE SIZE OF THE PAINT
I JUST HAVE TO PAINT IN MY BOLTS BUT I'M JUST KINDA PUTTING A LITTLE AND THIS IS JUST WHITE
WHICH YOU CAN PAINT SIDING WE DIDN'T REALIZE BUT ANYWAY THE PORCH WAS RESTORED THERE WAS A CONCRETE FLOOR TO IT THAT WAS ALL THAT WAS THERE
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT TEXTURE IN SOMETHING AND YOU JUST WANT TO USE AS A LAY DOWN MEDIUM YOU COULD ALSO USE THAT AND MIX IT WITH CAUSE IT IS OIL YOU NEED TO USE YOUR MINERAL SPIRITS YOUR PAINT THINNER AND YOU CAN APPLY THAT RIGHT ON TOP OF WHAT YOU JUST DREW AND IT'LL BLEND IT IN AND STILL LEAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A TEXTURE IF THAT'S THE EFFECT THAT YOU WANT JUST BY SMUDGING IT IN HERE
DECIDE WHAT PAINT BRUSH
AND TODAY WE ARE GOING TO PAINT A WOODEN FOOD TRAY
IF YOU DO PAINT ON TAPE BE SURE YOU LAP UP OVER IT AND NOT UNDERNEATH IT OR IT'LL ROLL UP UNDERNEATH THE TAPE
THIS GIVES ME A BETTER I CAN SWOOP THE PAINT AROUND AND DO SOME REALLY NEAT THINGS WITH THIS AND GET SOME TEXTURE
I'VE ALSO GOT SOME THESE ARE ACTUALLY CLAY SCULPTURE TOOLS BUT YOU CAN USE THEM TO KIND OF PULL OUT LINES AND SHAPES WHEN YOU HAVE THE PAINT ON THE CANVASS
I ALSO HAVE THIS PUFFY PAINT WHICH IS USED ON IT'S MADE TO PUT ON CLOTHING BUT IT ACTUALLY IS A REALLY NEAT WAY TO APPLY PAINT TO YOUR CANVASS
THIS IS A TYPE OF PAINT THAT GOES OVER AND PUTS A LATER ON TOP OF THE PICTURE FRAME
I'M GOING TO NEED SOME WHITE THICK BASE PAINT
I'LL NEED SOME PAINT AND GLUE
SO NOW I'VE SHOWN YOU HOW TO PAINT THE OUTSIDE OF THE PICTURE FRAME
BUT ANYTHING WILL DO A PAINT BRUSH OR EVEN YOUR FINGERS
NOW IF YOU ARE BUILDING A UNIT LIKE THIS YOU CAN LEAVE THE EDGE BARE LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN PAINT IT HOWEVER IT JUST WON'T LOOK AS GOOD AS IF YOU WHERE TO PUT A PIECE OF TRIM AND THERE AND PAINTED THE TRIM
PAINT BRUSH MOD PODGE
AND THE LAST THING ACTUALLY I LIKE TO DO AFTER THAT LAYER IS YOU TAKE YOUR PALETTE KNIFE AND START MAKING SOME LITTLE GOUGES HERE IN THE PAINT
OTHERWISE WE JUST PAINT THE WHOLE THING DARK TO BEGIN WITH
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE BUT I'M ROLLING MY BRUSH AROUND IN THE PAINT TOO TO TRY AND GET A NICE POINT ON IT BECAUSE MY SURFER GUY IS GOING TO HAVE SPIKEY HAIR
TAKE YOU PAINT AND ROLL IT A LITTLE BIT ON THE EDGE OF YOUR TOWEL WHATEVER YOU'RE USING TO DAB WITH AND GIVE YOUR WATER A CHANCE TO FALL OUT
YOU JUST WANT TO KEEP YOUR BRANCHES REAL THIN IF YOU CAN AND TRY REALLY CAREFULLY NOT TO MAKE IT A BIG BLOB BECAUSE IF YOU DO TOO MUCH PAINT ON THERE YOU'RE GOING NOT HAVE VERY MUCH DETAIL
THEY PAINT IT ON THE PIECE OF STEEL THAT THEY WANT THEN THEY'LL PUT THEIR PATTERN DOWN AND THEN THEY'LL USE A METAL SCRIBE OR A SHARP OBJECT AND THEY'LL SCRIBE THROUGH THE PAINT ONTO THE STEEL
DON'T APPLY TOO MUCH BECAUSE IT IS A VERY THICK PAINT AND IT GOES ON VERY HEAVY
SO WE CAN SEE AS WE APPLY THIS WHITE PAINT IT'S A VERY THICK HEAVY PAINT AND IT COVERS ALL THE MARKS ON OUR BOX
NOW WE'RE GOING TO APPLY THE WHITE BASE PAINT TO THE BOXES
FOR DECORATING OUR LIZARD WE'RE GOING TO USE ACRYLIC PAINT SOME TEMPERA GLITTER PAINT AND WE'LL ALSO BE USING SOME SEQUINS AND SOME GOOGLIE EYES
I HOPE THAT THIS HAS GIVE YOU SOME IDEA OF THE VARIATIONS OF COMMONLY USED WATER COLOR PAPERS AND IT CERTAINLY WILL EFFECT HOW YOU PAINT AND AND WHERE YOU CAN TAKE THESE PAPERS WHETHER IT'S OUTDOORS OR IN
SO IT'S ALSO EASY TO PAINT IT WHILE IT'S ON THE STICK BECAUSE A BALL IS HARD TO GRIP WHILE PAINTING IT SO THIS WAY IT GIVES US A WAY TO HOLD ONTO THE BALL AND GET ALL SIDES UNDERNEATH AND ON TOP ALL AROUND THE BALL VERY EASILY WHILE IT'S ON THE STICK
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE STICK GETS PAINT ON IT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE INSERTED INTO THE MILK CARTON
NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PAINT THE STYROFOAM BALL MEANING THAT THE STYROFOAM BALL IS GOING TO BE SITTING AT PRETTY MUCH IT'S GOING TO BE THE CENTER OF THE WINDMILL WHERE ALL THE ARMS ARE GOING TO BE HANGING
SOME OF THE MATERIALS THAT ARE NOT OKAY TO SAND ON ARE VENEERS AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHY IN JUST A SECOND TREATED LUMBER HAS CHEMICALS IN IT THAT COULD GET INTO THE AIR AND YOU COULD BREATHE THEM AND THEY COULD BE BAD FOR YOU IN ADDITION IF YOU HAVE ANY TYPE OF PAINTED WOOD THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE LEAD PAINT ON THEM
THIS IS GOING TO BE STRAIGHT PAINT
NOW I'M GOING TO TAKE MY SLIP SIMPLY PAINT IT ON ALL THE SPOTS TAKE THE TOP SIDE OF MY HANDLE AND PRESS IT AGAINST THE MUG LIKE SO
AND THE MORE TIME IT TAKES TO PAINT A PAINTING THE LESS INCOME BASICALLY
AND AS YOU'LL SEE ON THIS PIECE HERE WHICH I'VE ALREADY LAID OUT THERE'S A NUMBER OF VERY INTRICATE DETAILS ON THIS THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME AN EXTRAORDINARILY LONG TIME TO ACTUALLY PAINT
ACRYLIC PAINT IS A GREAT ALL PURPOSE PAINT FOR CRAFTS
THERE'S BEEN SOME PAINT BLOWN OUT THE LAST TIME IN THIS ONE THAT'S MIXED INTO THE OIL
IN THIS CASE YOU WOULD JUST PAINT THE EDGES ALSO
SO I'M GOING TO PAINT DIAMOND SHAPES
ALRIGHT =I'M LOOKING OVER THE NAILS AND I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE COLORS THAT WE'VE GOT SO FAR AND I THINK I WANT TO ADD A TAD BIT OF RED SO I MIGHT JUST ON THE DRY BRUSH SIDE GET A LITTLE BIT OF THAT RED PAINT KNOCK SOME OF IT OFF AND JUST DO A TAD BIT
HERE WHAT WE ARE DOING IS TAPING OFF THE MOLDING WHERE YOU DON'T WANT TO PAINT
SO YOU REALLY WANT TO PAINT TO ABOUT AN 1/4 OF INCH AWAY FROM YOUR TAPE LINE AND THEN FINISH THAT PART WITH THE BRUSH
WHAT THEY DO WHEN THEY ARE PAINTING WITH THE ROLLER IS THE TEMPTATION TO GO AND PAINT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TAPE LINE WHEN YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THE MORE PAINT YOU PUT ON THE TAPE YOU CREATE A SEAL SO THAT WHEN YOU PULL THE TAPE BACK YOU WIND UP PULLING THE PAINT AND MESSING UP A LOT OF GOOD WORK
YOU ALSO WANT TO USE SMOOTH EASY STROKES AND BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVER PAINT YOUR PREPARATION LINE
IT WILL CLEAN THE PAINT OFF THE CAR IF YOU CATCH IT FAIRLY SOON
WHEN THE PAPER IS HOT ON A GRIDDLE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TOUCH THAT WAX BLOCK YOU SEE AND YOU CAN DIRECTLY PAINT WITH THE WAX
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TELL WITH BLACK BECAUSE YOUR PAINT BRUSH BEING BLACK IT IS HARDER TO TELL HOW MUCH PAINT YOU'VE GOT ON THERE
THAT IS WHY I CHOSE TO USE THE METALLIC PAINT
YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH SIDE OF THE FOIL YOU WANT TO USE BUT I LIKE TO USE THIS SIDE BECAUSE IT HOLDS PAINT A LITTLE BIT BETTER
BUT IF I'M GOING TO SET IT UP AND CLEAN IT THEN I WANT TO ACTUALLY TAKE THIS AND WITH WARM SOAPY WATER PREFERABLY WITH THE O-RING OFF WASH THIS AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE PORTS ALONG THE BARREL SURFACE ARE CLEAN AND CLEAR OF PAINT DEBRIS
HI THIS IS DAN NOW WE ARE GOING TO DEMONSTRATE HOW TO SMOOTH YOUR WALLS ONCE YOU PUT YOUR FIRST COAT OF PAINT ON IT
NOW IF YOU MOVE THIS YOU ARE GOING TO NOTICE THAT YOU START GETTING LINES IN YOUR PAINT
SO YOU JUST KINDA HAVE TO THINK IN TERMS OF THE LAYERS GOING BACKWARDS VERSUS WHEN YOU PAINT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
DAVID A CLEMEN HI I'M DAVID CLEMEN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO PAINT A PIECE OF GLASS INSIDE OF A FRAME
SO I'M GOING TO START WITH AND WHEN YOU PAINT WITH ACRYLIC ON GLASS YOU DON'T WANT TO USE ANY WATER ON THE PAINT BECAUSE IT TENDS TO STREAK IF YOU PUT WATER ON IT AND THAT'S NOT GONNA IT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO HELP YOUR PAINTING AT ALL
YOU JUST KINDA PAINT AS YOU GO
ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME NEW SIDING INSTALLED AND YOU NEED A CONTRACTOR OUT THERE ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO CAULK AND PAINT IT AS WELL
IT'S A LAYOUT PAINT
YOU GRAB YOUR PAINT GET YOUR CAN READY AND KEEP THE HANDLE OF THE CAN OVER HERE SO THAT WHEN IT FLIPS IT DOESN'T GET ONTO THE HANDLE
THAT WAY IF ANY PAINT FLIES OVER IT'S NOT GOING LAND ON THAT HANDLE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT OUR HANDS ON
YOU CAN ALSO GET STICKS AT THE PAINT STORE
THERE IS THE OIL BASED PASTEL WHICH IS A LOT OF FUN AND IT BLENDS EITHER WITH Q-TIPS OR ACTUALLY I'VE TRIED IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PAINT REMOVER LACQUER THINNER AND ITS AN INTERESTING PROCESS BUT I THINK JUST TO KEEP THE SMELLS DOWN AND JUST TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN JUST TRY BLENDING IT FIRST WITH THE PROFESSIONAL Q-TIP OR THE NUBS THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER AND I'LL EXPLAIN THOSE TO YOU IN JUST A MINUTE
JUST MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FILL UP THE HOLES WITH THE PAINT
I CALL IT SPILLING THE PAINT BOX BY DESIGN
SO GO AHEAD AND GET YOURSELF A FULL LOAD OF PAINT
AND THEN WORK THAT PAINT UP IN THERE
NOW WHEN YOU GO SIDEWAYS LIKE THIS YOU'LL GET MORE PAINT ON YOUR BRUSH
IT'S ALMOST GLASSY AND THE PAINT SITS ON IT DIFFERENTLY
IT STAYS OUT IT'S A HARD CRUST WHICH MAKE IT EASIER TO PAINT SO THIS IS THE STRAWBERRY THAT I MADE YOU CAN SEE THAT IT IS ALREADY SHAPE ALL I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THE SHAPE SPOT WE ARE GOING TO COLOR IT
NOW I'M GOING TO USE THE GREEN FOOD COLORING JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU EITHER USE A DIFFERENT PAINT BRUSH OR WASH YOUR PAINT BRUSH VERY GOOD USE A DIFFERENT BOWL OR AGAIN WASH YOU BOWL REALLY GOOD OTHERWISE YOU ARE GOING TO GET A TOTALLY DIFFERENT COLOR FROM WHAT YOU WANTED
AND SOME OF THE THINGS YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT FIRST IS WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO PAINT THE INSIDE OF YOUR DESIGN FIRST OR WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE OUTSIDE OF THE GOURD OR HOW MUCH IS GONNA BE THE NATURAL GOURD IS SHOWING
YOU CAN ALSO USE WHAT THEY HAVE OUT ON THE MARKET NOW THEY'RE CALLED PAINT PENS
PAINT PENTS WORK REALLY WELL
ANOTHER WAY AND IN MY MIND THIS WOULD BE JUST ABOUT EVERY ARTIST'S DREAM IS TO MOVE TO SOME PLACE LIKE NEW YORK PARIS ITALY SOME YEAH EXOTIC FOREIGN LOCATION ANYWHERE LIKE THAT OPEN UP YOUR LITTLE ART GALLERY YOUR VERY OWN LITTLE ART GALLERY AND JUST PAINT
MAKE SURE YOU SHAKE YOUR PAINT ENAMEL PAINT SEPARATES A LOT A LITTLE BIT OUT AND IT'S OKAY WITH THIS TO ACTUALLY HAVE PAINT ON BOTH SIDES OF YOUR BRUSH
YOU WANT TO PAINT IT ON SO THAT YOUR SKIN IS COMPLETELY SMOOTH AND CLEAR LIKE A WHITE PIECE OF PAPER BEFORE A PAINTER STARTS PAINTING
AN AIRLESS SPRAYER PUMPS THE PAINT THROUGH YOUR ORIFICE AND MAKES IT OUT INTO YOUR PINE SPRAY FINISH AND YOU HAVE YOUR ADJUSTMENT ON HERE TO ADJUST YOUR PRESSURE
THIS IS HOW YOU POUR UP PAINT TO GET READY TO PAINT THE EXTERIOR EAVES
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THE TABLE I'M GOING TO USE MY LASHING TO BIND TOGETHER HERE A COUPLE OF MY ARTIST TOOLS HERE A COUPLE OF PAINT BRUSHES A PENCIL AND A MARKER
NOW IF THE TEAM THAT'S NOT REALLY SHOOTING A LOT OF JUMP SHOTS AND THEY'RE NOT REALLY HITTING A LOT OF JUMP SHOTS AND THEY'RE REALLY PENETRATING THE PAINT YOU MIGHT WANT TO PACK IT IN A LITTLE BIT
THE OLDER ONES LIKE THIS THEY'RE PAINTED ON AND IT'LL SMEAR THE PAINT AND YOUR ORNAMENT WILL BE RUINED
AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S LOTS OF CRUNCHY OLD PAINT AND NASTY STUFF
AND YOU KNOW THAT THE FURTHER YOU PULL BACK THE AIRBRUSH THE MORE PAINT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET OUT AND ONE THING THAT YOU WANT TO DO UNLESS YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THAT THEN YOU WANT TO MOVE AS FAST AS YOU CAN
OKAY WE'VE GOT YOUR PAINT AND YOU'VE PLAYED AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE BIT AND YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THE AIRBRUSH LET'S GO OVER A COUPLE OF LITTLE THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO WORK WITH
JUST KEEP PLAYING WITH IT HAVE FUN AND DON'T LET IT IF YOU START HAVING PROBLEMS WITH IT IT CLOGS UP TAKE A MOMENT PULL THE NEEDLE OUT CLEAN IT DUMP YOUR PAINT OUT AND JUST GIVE IT JUST A LIGHT CLEANING
SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE YOUR PAINT BRUSH STAYS IN A NICE POINT
I GO A HEAD GET MY PAINT BRUSH WET GET MY BLACK I DO LIKE THE BLACK TO DO A PALM TREE JUST BECAUSE IT REALLY HAS A NICE CONTRAST WITH THE OTHER COLORS THAT I'M DOING
AND I ACTUALLY NEED MORE PAINT
AND YOU HAVE TO GET YOU HAVE TO TOUCH YOUR PAINT UP PRETTY OFTEN BECAUSE IF IT GETS THIN ON HERE IT'LL STREAK AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THROUGH
SO FAR WE'VE PUT PAINT ON OUR RAZORBLADE AND GLUE SO IT WOULD BE DRYING
SO MAKE SURE REMEMBER ONCE AGAIN WHEN USING THESE PAINTS AND WE'RE USING ACRYLIC PAINT YOU WANT TO GIVE YOURSELF ABOUT AN HOUR PER COAT
IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO'S GOT A FAVORITE COLOR YOU CAN COME BACK TO YOUR SAME PAINT YOU HAD BEFORE YOUR ACRYLIC PAINT YOU CAN PAINT THE TIPS OF THESE WHICH GIVES IT A REALLY COOL EFFECT
AND YOU CAN EVEN DO THIS BEFORE IF YOU WANT TO PAINT DESIGNS ON YOUR SHELLS IT'S ANOTHER GREAT IDEA TO DO
YOU CAN PAINT THE WHOLE SHELL YOU CAN JUST DO THE TIPS LIKE I'M DOING HERE
IF YOU'RE REALLY IN TO MONOCHROMATIC COLORS WE'VE GOT PINK AND BLUE HERE YOU CAN EVEN PAINT YOUR SHELLS
IT'S PRETTY RUSTY AND ANY PAINT HAS VANISHED LONG AGO
I PREFER TO USE PRE-PRIMED JUST BECAUSE IT SAVES YOU A STEP WHEN YOU'RE READY TO PAINT
YOU CAN SEE OCCASIONALLY I PUT A COAT OF PAINT ON IT JUST TO KEEP IT FRESH
SO THEN THE NEXT OPTION IS FOR PAPERS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IN A SPECIFIC COLOR THAT YOU ARE FLIPPING THROUGH MAGAZINES CAN'T FIND OR LOOKING IN A PAPER STORE AND CAN'T FIND IS TO PAINT THE PAPER YOURSELF
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK OBVIOUSLY BUT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY PUT A LAYER OF PAINT ALONG THE OUTER EDGES WHICH ARE WHICH WERE COVERED WITH MASKING TAPE
NOW WHEN I USE THE PAINT I'M GOING TO BE USING A SOLID COLOR BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE DECORATING IT WITH A LOT OF BEADS AND I DON'T WANT IT TO BE TOO LOOK TOO KIND OF BUSY SO TO SPEAK
NOW I'M NOT SO WORRIED ABOUT THE TEXTURE UNDERNEATH OF THE MASKING TAPE AND THE WHITE BASE PAINT WHICH ALSO WENT ON KIND OF THICK BECAUSE THE TEXTURE IS KIND OF A I KIND OF LIKE HAVING A THE LITTLE BIT OF TEXTURE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PICTURE FRAME
NOW THAT THE COAT OF BASE PAINT THAT I'VE PUT ON HAS DRIED I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND COLOR THE PICTURE FRAME WITH MY YELLOW ACRYLIC PAINT
THIS WORKS GREAT LIKE I SAID PLUS IF YOU PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD USE WD FORTY IT'S A PETROLEUM BASE IT WILL USUALLY CLEAN UP AND I'VE ALSO BEEN TOLD IT WILL CLEAN UP IF YOUR CAR GETS HIT WITH SPRAY PAINT
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE SURE THAT YOUR PAINT STAYS GOOD AND FRESH
JUST TAKE OFF THAT LITTLE BIT OF PAINT AND WORK YOURSELF AROUND THAT RIM
SPEND A LITTLE EXTRA TIME AND BE SURE TO GET ALL THIS PAINT OUT OF THAT RIM BEFORE YOU SEAL BACK UP THIS CAN
WHEN YOU DO THAT THAT'S GOING TO STOP THAT FLOW OF PAINT AND THEN EVEN IT OFF
THE OTHER THING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO ESPECIALLY SUCH AS WITH THIS BARREL WHERE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN PAINT A BALL HAS BROKEN IN IT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU BRING ALL THAT DEBRIS OUT
SO YOU HAVE SOMEONE INSIDE THE CAR PUSHING DOWN ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AND ONCE THEY HAVE THE BRAKE PEDAL DOWN ALL THE WAY THEY WILL SAY DOWN AND YOU WILL LOOSEN THIS LITER VALVE RIGHT HERE IN THE LOOSEN DIRECTION AND LIQUID WILL COME OUT AND IT IS GOOD TO HAVE A CATCH CAN FOR THAT TOO BECAUSE IT GETS IN ALL THIS PAINT AND IT WILL EAT THAT OR WHEN YOU ARE DONE JUST WIPE IT ALL OFF AND ONCE YOU HAVE HAD IT SO THAT NO MORE LIQUID IS COMING OUT YOU TIGHTEN IT BACK UP AND YOU TELL THEM TO LET IT BACK UP AND THEY PUSH IT DOWN AGAIN AND YOU REPEAT THAT AND YOU OPEN THIS AGAIN AND BLEED IT OUT AND PERIODICALLY MAKE SURE YOU ARE CHECKING THE MASTER CYLINDER WHICH IS WHAT WE HAD OPENED AT FIRST AND WE USED THE TURKEY BASTER FOR FOR TAKING OUT THE FLUID AND YOU KEEP DOING THIS STEP OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON THIS PARTICULAR WHEEL UNTIL YOU GET NEW CLEAR FLUID COMING OUT AND THIS ONE IS DONE AND YOU WILL REMOVE THE NEXT ONE IN THE BACK AND THEN DO THE FRONT ONES
DON'T SWIRL IT AROUND AND WIPE OFF THE PAINT ONTO YOUR PAPER TOWEL
I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO APPLY SOME MORE PAINT TO THESE LITTLE SHELLS HERE
AND THIS ACRYLIC PAINT IS GREAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH ANY POROUS SURFACE LIKE SHELLS OR WOOD IT'S GOING TO SOAK THAT PAINT RIGHT UP SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY PROBLEMS
SO GENERALLY ON THE FIRST FIRE YOU CONCENTRATE ON GETTING THE SHAPE OF YOUR PAINTING IN AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO HAVE ALL THE HIGHLIGHTS WHERE YOU WANT THEM AND THE LIGHTNESS THAT YOU WANT THEM BECAUSE YOU CANNOT GO BACK AND ADD PAINT ON TOP TO LIGHTEN THEM LIKE YOU DO WITH OIL PAINT OR ACRYLIC PAINT
AND IF YOU CAN GET A STUBBORN HOLE TO FILL UP JUST PUMP THAT BRUSH A LITTLE BIT IN AND OUT AND THAT'LL MOVE THAT PAINT UP INTO INTO THE BRUSH
WE'RE GOING TO USE A PAINT STIR STICK TO STIR THIS AS IT STARTS MELTING
NOW YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND POUR YOUR PAINT
YOU DON'T WANT EXCESS PAINT LAYING AROUND THE JOB SITE
NOW WE CAN KNOCK OUT THE GREEN BACKGROUND IN PHOTOSHOP OR ANOTHER PROGRAM BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH THIS WHITE SPACE IS WE'D HAVE TO PAINT AROUND THE IMAGE SO THAT WE'D HAVE THIS BLEND INTO A SKIN TONE
YOU WANT TO AHEAD AND PULL THAT PAINT ON OUT BEING CAREFUL NOT TO LAP
WE'RE GOING TO CARRY THIS FASCIA ON DOWN BUT THAT'S HOW YOU PAINT THE EXTERIOR FASCIA ON THE EXTERIOR EAVES OF YOUR HOUSE
DEPENDING ON WHICH AGE OF KIDS AND HOW YOU WANT TO WORK THE PROJECT YOU CAN USE A PAINT BRUSH OR YOU CAN HAVE THEM SMEAR THE GLUE WITH THEIR FINGER
SINCE WE USED A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAINT
LET THE PAINT DRY AND THE GLUE DRY
IF YOU NEED TO DO A COUPLE OF COATS OF PAINT ON YOUR LIZARD YOU CAN DO THAT LET IT DRY COME BACK AND THEN PAINT IT OVER AGAIN
IF YOU PUT HIM ON A NEWSPAPER TO DRY WITH THIS KIND OF PAINT WITH THE ACRYLIC PAINT WHEN YOU LIFT HIM UP HE IS GOING TO HAVE PIECES OF THAT NEWSPAPER STUCK IT HIM AND IT IS ONLY GOING TO CREATE MORE OF A PROCESS FOR GOING BACK AND CLEANING UP AND REPAINTING AND PAINTING OVER
BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE PREMISE AND EACH OF THOSE WILL HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GETTING ANYTHING THAT COMES IN THAT PAINT
NOW IF IT GETS PAST THIS SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE THEN BACK HERE YOU'LL HAVE THE CENTER WHICH IS AGAIN THE CENTER WILL BE THE ONE THAT HOLDS THE PAINT DOWN AND IS IN THE MIDDLE ANYTHING THAT GETS PAST THAT LINE OF DEFENSE IS HIS OR HER RESPONSIBILITY
AND I'M GOING TO NEED PAINT I'M GOING TO NEED BRUSHES
WE'RE GOING TO PAINT ON THE FABRIC FOR OUR DIY PANTS
IT'S GOT A NICE NICE SURFACE HERE THAT'S SMOOTH WE DON'T HAVE CREASES THAT WE CAN PAINT ON
NOW REMEMBER WITH THIS THIS IS THE HARDEST PART SO GET THE EDGES PAINT ALL THIS THEN THE REST IS ALL OKAY
SO WE ARE GOING TO PAINT THAT UP TO HERE ALL THE WAY AROUND AND BRING IT ON DOWN CAUSE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO START ON THESE OUTSIDE EDGES
NOW THIS MEANS WE ARE GOING TO PAINT IT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE DOOR STOP
NOW WITH THE JAMS JUST LIKE WITH THE DOORS WE ONLY WANT TO PAINT THE PART THAT IS FACING THE LIVING ROOM WHERE WE ARE WORKING
OKAY NOW WE ARE READY TO PAINT THE DOOR JAMS WE PAINTED ALL THE DOORS AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO THE JAMS
JOHN R JUNGER ONE OF MY GREATEST JOY IS TEACHING WATER COLOR PAINTING AND I HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS AND I'M VERY PLEASED THAT THEY WENT ON AND ON TO PAINT IN THEIR OWN MANNER AND ENJOY THEIR LIVES
YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS PAINT REALLY GIVES A VERY THICK LAYER THAT WILL LET THE COLORS THAT YOU PUT ON TOP OF IT SHINE THROUGH
SO YOU CAN SEE THIS PAINT REALLY COVERS UP WHAT'S UNDERNEATH
LEAVING OUT THE PAINT FROM THIS PROJECT IS KIND OF A DOWN SIDE FOR KIDS WHO REALLY ENJOY PAINTING
O.K SO NOW THAT WE HAVE ALL OF OUR TOOLS IN PLACE WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER SOME OF THE MATERIALS WE'LL NEED INCLUDING PAINT FOR PAINTING OUR KITCHEN
