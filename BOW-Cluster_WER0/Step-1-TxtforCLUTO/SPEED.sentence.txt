IF YOU DUMPED IT ALL IN AT ONCE YOU'D HAVE THIS REALLY LOOSE MIXTURE WITH A BIG THICK CENTER IN IT AND BY DOING IT LIKE THIS WE'RE ADDING THE MILK IN AND IT'S ACTUALLY GETTING MIXED IN AS IT GETS POURED IN.  YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST YOU CAN SEE HOW IT'S STARTING TO BE WHAT I WAS SAYING EARLIER HOW IT'S REALLY RUNNY AROUND THE EDGES AND THICK IN THE MIDDLE.  I'M CAN JUST TURN MY SPEED UP TO DEAL WITH THAT THERE WE GO.  YOU JUST GOT TO GET YOUR MILK IN THERE.  NOW LET'S GO AHEAD AND DUMP IT ALL IN THERE AT THE END.  ALRIGHT SO THERE'S ALL YOUR INGREDIENTS EXCEPT FOR YOUR FRUIT AND NUTS AT THIS POINT WHICH ARE GOING TO GO IN ABSOLUTELY LAST.  SO LET'S GIVE THIS LET ME GIVE THIS A COUPLE OF MINUTES AT THIS SPEED AND LET'S SCRAPE THE SIDES DOWN AND WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK AND FOLD THE FRUITS AND NUTS IN AND GET OUR PAN READY AND THROW IT IN THE OVEN.                                 
YOU CAN SPEED IT UP YOU CAN CHANGE THE DEFINITION IN THE MOVEMENT HERE
THIS IS A NORMAL SPEED ONE SPELL CARD
OKAY ONE LAST TIME WE GO NORMAL SPEED
YOUR SPEED HAS TO GO THROUGH THE BOARD AND BREAK THE BOARD
AND YOU CAN SPEED UP HERE JUST A LITTLE BIT MAKE THEM SHORT AND TINY MOVEMENTS
AGAIN DONE SLOW IT LOOKS LIKE THIS SO ONE TAKE THE ELBOW UP AND DRIVE THE FIST OUT THIS IS A SPEED PUNCH NOT NECESSARILY USED WITH POWER SO ONE TWO
SO FULL SPEED CHEST PASS
NOW JONSIE IS GOING TO DO IT FULL SPEED
BACK AND FORTH GO AHEAD AND GO FULL SPEED FELLAS
I'LL DEMONSTRATE THIS FIRST AT NORMAL SPEED THEN I'LL HAVE MELISSA GO THROUGH IT SEVERAL TIMES SLOWING IT DOWN POINTING OUT SOME OF THE FINER POINTS
BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO IS GET AS MUCH SPEED AND FOLLOW THROUGH ON THIS SHOT AS POSSIBLE
AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE TRYING TO CONTROL THE SPEED TO COME BACK AND JUST GENTLY NURSE IT UP IN FRONT OF THE POCKET SO THAT WE GET IT INTO EASY SCORING POSITION SO THAT WE CAN GO BACK AND FORTH ONCE AGAIN
YOU'LL ALSO USE THE STIR SPEED ANYTIME YOU ARE INCORPORATING INGREDIENTS INTO A DOUGH OR BATTER THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE YOU DON'T WANT TO START OFF REALLY FAST AND HAVE THE INGREDIENTS FLY BACK OUT OF THE BOWL
IF YOU WANT TO INCORPORATE ALL THE INGREDIENTS NICE AND THOROUGHLY AND ALSO GET THOSE POTATOES NICE AND FLUFFY YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO USE THE FLAT PADDLE AND A SLOW SPEED
AT THIS SPEED THE POTATOES WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DEVELOP ANY GLUTTON AND SO YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE NICE LIGHT FLUFFY POTATOES
FOR THE FIRST SPEED OF THE MIXER IS STIR OR NUMBER ONE
THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS THE SPEED IN WHICH YOU WANT TO INCORPORATE MOST OF YOUR INGREDIENTS EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT PLANNING ON STAYING ON SUCH A LOW SPEED
YOUR PRIMARY BEATERS THAT YOU'LL BE USING FOR THE STIR SPEED WOULD BE YOUR DOUGH HOOK PARTICULARLY WHEN MAKING BREAD AND ALSO YOUR PADDLE
YOU WANT TO HAVE A NICE HIGH SPEED PARTICULARLY FOR THE LAST STAGES OF YOUR CAKE MAKING MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS WELL INCORPORATED
YOU CAN SEE HOW WELL IT INCORPORATED EVERYTHING AND HOW YOU HAVE IT NICE BATTER IT'S VERY FLOWING AND IT'S GREAT TO HAVE IT AT THAT SPEED
THIS IS A NICE LIQUIDLY FLOWING BATTER SO YOU CAN HAVE A HIGHER SPEED BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO CLOG THE MOTOR UP AT ALL
IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SPIN A COMPLETE 180 BECAUSE ONCE YOU START LEARNING THEM YOU WOULD CARRY MUCH BETTER SPEED RIDING OUT BACKWARDS IF YOU SPIN IT REALLY A COMPLETE 180 RATHER THEN SPINNING YOU KNOW A 160 DEGREES OR SO WHERE YOU ARE BASICALLY GOING TO LAND IN A COMPLETE STOP
AND WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING IT UP TO A FASTER SPEED IT SOUNDS NICE AND HAS A FULLER SOUND
IT'S EASY TO GET IN TO THIS POSITION BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS BY ROLLING BACKWARDS WITH TOO MUCH SPEED AND YOU END UP LOCKING OVER
SO YOU WANT TO CREATE AS MUCH CLUB HEAD SPEED FOR THOSE HIGH HANDICAP PLAYERS WHO HAVE TROUBLE GETTING THE BALL UP IN THE AIR
DROPPING IN BEING THE FIRST WHICH ACTUALLY EMULATES A TAIL TAP WHEN YOU DROP IN AND BEING ABLE TO RIDE BACKWARDS ON YOUR SKATEBOARD AT A CONSTANT SPEED TO GET BACK UP TO THE COPING WHERE YOU ORIGINALLY DROPPED IN FROM
THIS IS A SPEED BALL NIB
DOING THOSE TWO EXERCISES WILL HELP INCREASE YOUR SPEED AND YOUR POWER AND IT WILL DEFINITELY MAKE YOU RUN FASTER
ALSO IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE RUNNING FIVE SEVEN MILES THEN YOU WANT TO KEEP THAT WARM UP SPEED INSTEAD OF A 1/2 MILE YOU WANT TO PICK IT UP TO A MILE IN A NICE STEADY JOG THEN YOU CAN INCREASE THEREFORE AFTER
WITH THE PROPER TREATMENT OF REST THE APPLICATION OF ICE AND THE APPLICATION OF HEAT IF IT CAME ON GRADUALLY WILL SPEED THE HEALING AND RECOVERY PROCESS
SO WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE AT FULL SPEED HERE WITH THIS GUY DRIBBLING INTO THE DEFENDER PULLING IT BACK AND THEN EXPLODING ON PAST THE DEFENDER
NOW IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO PRACTICE YOUR ROUND OFF WITH SPEED AND POWER AND HEIGHT
YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GETTING A YOU KNOW A BRAND NEW KITE THAT'S GOT A WARRANTY AND IT'S TOTALLY GOOD UP TO WORKING SPEED AND ORDER
SOME OF THEM HAVE DOLLARS EXCUSE ME SOME OF THEM HAVE CONTROLLERS WHICH AUTOMATICALLY ADJUST THE TEMPERATURE AND OTHERS JUST SIMPLY USE A VARIABLE SPEED SORT OF POTENTIOMETER DIAL AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING AT THE PYROMETER WHICH TELLS YOU WHAT TEMPERATURE YOU'RE AT
ONE ARM PUSHES AS THE OTHER ONE'S COMING BACK DOWN YOUR HIPS THE OTHER ONE STARTS THE STROKE AND THEN YOU CAN PICK UP THE SPEED AS FAST OR AS SLOW AS YOU LIKE
NOW WHEN DOING SPEED CHUCKS IT IS IMPORTANT TO CUT SOUNDS IT'S KIND OF SILLY BUT YOU DO ACTUALLY NEED TO WARM UP FOR IT ALRIGHT
FOR SPEED CHUCKS YOU'RE GOING TO BE SPINNING THEM AROUND YOUR FINGERS AROUND YOUR THUMBS OKAY AROUND WRIST
SO I'VE ACTUALLY HURT MY WRIST BEFORE WHEN YOU START BUILDING UP SPEED AND GOING REALLY FAST
I'M HERE WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO USE SPEED CHUCKS
THAT WAY YOU WON'T BE IN OVER YOUR HEAD OR PICK UP TOO MUCH SPEED WITHOUT WANTING TO
ONCE YOU YOU GOT ENOUGH SPEED COMING DOWN THE QUARTERS SLOW TO MEDIUM PACE YOU WANT TO HEAD UP THE RAMP
SO PLAYED AT A REGULAR SAY STRUMMED SPEED WOULD BE AND AGAIN LIKE ALL BARRE CHORDS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR THUMB IN THE BACK OF THE MIDDLE OF THE NECK REINFORCING THE BARRE ON THE SIXTH FRET AND HAVE YOUR FINGERS NICE AND ARCHED OVER SO YOU HEAR EVERY NOTE CLEANLY
THAT'S WHEN THE OVERALL DISTANCE IS FRESHEST IN MY MIND AND I TEND TO ROLL AT THE RIGHT SPEED MORE TIMES THAN NOT
A POWER SCREW DRIVER THAT S OPTIONAL BECAUSE IT WILL SPEED UP THINGS
OKAY SO YOU SEE THAT I DON'T HAVE THE MIXER ON A HIGH SPEED I'M BLENDING IT NICE AND SOFT NOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO FIRST IS I'M GOING TO ADD A LITTLE BIT OF THE HEAVY CREAM A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME CAUSE I'M REALLY GOING TO JUST ADD ENOUGH SO THAT I HAVE A NICE SMOOTH CONSISTENCY NOT TO WATERY BUT JUST ENOUGH SO THAT CHEESECAKE WILL BAKE UP NICE AND FIRM
WHEN YOU DO HAVE IT DOWN THOUGH YOU WANT TO BE CONFIDENT ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN DO IT AT FULL SPEED
AND ONE THING ABOUT NIGHTTIME PHOTOGRAPHY IS IT'S LOW LIGHT SO THE SHUTTER SPEED THAT I WAS USING MIGHT BE VERY SLOW
NOW ONCE YOU GET YOUR BASIC MASTERED YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SPEED IT UP A LITTLE BIT SO YOU CAN GET SOME MOMENTUM BUILDING
AT REGULAR SPEED IT LOOKS LIKE THIS
NOW AS MELISSA INCREASES RIGHT HER ABILITY TO STRIKE HER SPEED AND HER POWER RIGHT WHAT I'LL DO IS AS THE HAND COMES DOWN A LITTLE BIT HARDER NEXT ONE I'LL MEET THE HAND OKAY MEETING THE GLOVE
THIS IS A TWO SPEED GRINDER
IT OPERATES AT A SLOW SPEED AND A HIGH SPEED BUT I ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY WILL OPERATE THIS BENCH GRINDER AT THE LOWER SPEED WHICH IS ABOUT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED FIFTY RPMS
THE REASON FOR USING A CARVING TURN AS OPPOSED TO A BASIC NO SKI TURN IS IT ALLOWS YOU TO TURN WITH MORE SPEED BE MORE FLUID AND IF YOU ARE PROGRESSING AND SKIING ON STEEPER MORE ADVANCED SKI RUNS THIS WILL MAKE YOU SO YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE IT DOWN MORE SAFELY
NOW IMAGINE THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABOUT WHEN YOUR SPEED RUNS OUT AND YOU'VE REACHED THE END OF YOUR NOSEBLUNT SLIDE
AND IF YOU RECAPTURE IT AGAIN IT'S ALL ABOUT SPEED GOING THROUGH THE BOARD BREAKING THE BOARD CLEAN HALFWAY THROUGH
WELL GENERALLY THEIR GOING TO HAVE A DECAL ALONG THE TOP THAT SAYS MADE IN ENGLAND AND ANOTHER THING IS THEIR GOING TO HAVE A THREE SPEED THUMB SHIFTER AND WHAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN VALUE IN THESE TWO BIKES
FIRST OF ALL HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S A ENGLISH THREE SPEED
SO YOU'VE FOUND A ENGLISH THREE SPEED AND YOU WANT TO KNOW IT IT'S VALUABLE OR NOT
AGAIN HERE IS ONE SLOW ONE TWO THREE ONE WITH A LITTLE MORE SPEED JUST LIKE THAT
AGAIN A LITTLE SLOW ONE TWO THREE AND THEN ONE WITH MORE SPEED JUST LIKE THAT
FOR THAT LEVEL WE MAY SHOW ANOTHER VIDEO WHICH IS A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN THIS ONE TO RECORD BECAUSE IT IS RECORDED IN A HIGHER SPEED AND IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO DETECT BECAUSE A LOT OF THE ACTION THAT HAPPENS IS INTERNAL AND IT'S NOT AS VISIBLE THE FORM ITSELF IS JUST A DEMONSTRATION OF SO FOR NOW JUST PRACTICE WHAT I'VE SHOWED YOU HERE
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SPEED TO PERFORM THE TRICKS THAT I'M GOING TO BE TEACHING YOU IN THE REST OF THE SERIES
THE PREMISE BEHIND IT IS THAT THE VINEGAR WILL ACTUALLY SPEED UP YOUR METABOLISM AND CAUSE YOU TO BURN OFF THE FOOD THAT YOU ARE EATING MUCH MORE RAPIDLY
BUT MY POINT IS PEOPLE TEND TO FOCUS ON THE LINE AND FORGET ABOUT THE SPEED NOT REALIZING THAT THE ODDS OF THEM MAKING THIS PUTT AREN'T VERY GOOD
THE SPEED OF THE PUTT IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN ITS DIRECTION
SPEED UP YOUR CHOO CHOO
SO IF YOU DO BEGIN TO SLOW DOWN AND GET WOBBLY BEST THING TO DO IS JUST TRY AND MAINTAIN A STEADY PEDALING SPEED
NOW WE'LL PICK UP THE PACE AND SEE IF OUR RIDER CAN ALSO THEN PUT THAT COORDINATED EFFORT HER SHORT REIN RIGHT HAND ON THE REIN LEFT HAND READY TO SNAG THAT FLAG AND BRING IT ON HOME WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SPEED
SO YOU CAN SEE WITH PRACTICE THIS RIDER CAN CONTINUE TO INCREASE HER SPEED AS HER ACCURACY STAYED CORRECT
BUT ALSO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR LOAD RATINGS AFTER YOUR SPEED RATING ON A TIRE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE LOAD RATING AND THE LOAD RATING HERE IS AN INDEX OF 97
REMEMBER IT IS A SPEED TECHNIQUE
SO YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT YOUR ISO YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT YOUR SHUTTER SPEED AS WELL YOU WANT TO SHOOT MANUAL
SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR SHUTTER SPEED YOUR APERTURE YOU WANT IT HIGHER YOUR FILM SPEED YOU WANT IT LOWER AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KEY SETTINGS ON YOUR DIGITAL SLR FOR JEWELRY PHOTOGRAPHY
SHOOT ON MANUAL AND YOU'LL HAVE TO WORK OUT THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR WHAT YOUR THE PROPER SHUTTER SPEED IS
THE GOAL OF THE TUNNEL WILL BE TO HAVE YOUR DOG BE BALANCED WITH SPEED AND MOVEMENT TO GET THROUGH THE TUNNEL AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
GET A LITTLE BIT OF SPEED AND STOMP ON THE NOSE AND AS YOU STOMP SPIN YOUR BODY IN THE DIRECTION THAT YOU WANT TO TURN AND ON THIS THE NOLLIE FRONTSIDE 180 IS THE SPIN WHERE YOU CAN SEE WHERE YOU ARE TURNING THUS MAKING IT THE EASIER OF THE TWO BUT WHEN YOU INCORPORATE THE PUSHING AND RIDING AROUND AND ALL THE OTHER PARTS OF THE NOLLIE 180 AND YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS
DRILL IT NICE AND SLOW AND THEN SPEED IT UP IN FRONT OF A MIRROR UNTIL YOU GET IT NICE AND SMOOTH
THOSE TWO FULL PASSES YOU'LL BE DRIVING YOUR CAR AT THE SPEED THAT YOU'LL BE COMPETING WITH WITHIN THOSE PARAMETERS
YOU DO GO FULL SPEED TO THE HALF TRACK MARK
THEN YOU HAVE THREE MODERATE PASSES WHICH ARE BASICALLY PASSES WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO FULL SPEED ALL THE WAY TO THE FINISH LINE
WORK ON SOME SPEED CHUCKS
THEY'LL BE EASILY TO INCORPORATE THE FLAT BEATER YOU'LL SEE WITH THIS ONE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE IT AT AS A HIGH SPEED AS YOU WOULD WITH THE WHISK
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO WHIP THINGS UP AND MAKE THEM NICE AND FLUFFY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE IT AT A SLOWER MORE MODERATE BEATING SPEED
DEPENDING ON WHAT EXACTLY YOU ARE MAKING YOU CAN HAVE IT FROM NICE AND SLOW SPEED UP TO A MUCH MORE FASTER SPEED
SPEED IS ANOTHER THING TOO
WATCH YOUR ENTRY SPEED AS YOU GO IN AND YOU JUST WANT TO BE NICE AND SMOOTH WITH YOUR STEERING ON THOSE LONG AND SMOOTH CORNERS BUT ON THESE SHORT FAST CORNERS YOU CAN BE VERY VIOLENT AND JUST GET THE CAR SIDEWAYS
THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS IN CONTROL OF YOUR SPEED
SO LET ME SHOW YOU ONE MORE TIME IN REAL SPEED
AND DURING INCLEMENT WEATHER SUCH AS RAIN SNOW OR SLEET AND SO ON BE AT LEAST FIVE MILES BELOW THE REGULAR SPEED LIMIT
THIS IS A POWER RACE SO YOU WANT TO RUN WITH PURE POWER SPEED
YOU WANT TO PICK UP A LITTLE BIT OF SPEED PULL UP THE FRONT END COUNTER BALANCE JUST LET IT GO
EXCELLENT HE'S FOUND HIS BALL HE NOW CAN GO AHEAD AND PLAY HIS SECOND SHOT AND WE'VE HELPED SPEED UP THE PACE OF PLAY
WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON TANTUI SERIES I THE TRANSITION TO RIGHT BACK FIST AND FINISH TANTUI I I'LL DEMONSTRATE IT FOR YOU AT NORMAL SPEED THEN I'LL HAVE MELISSA PERFORM IT FOR YOU SLOWED DOWN SO I CAN POINT OUT SOME OF THE FINER DETAILS PICKING IT UP FROM WHERE WE PERFORMED ROLLING BLOCK RIGHT TOE KICK
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF ETIQUETTE NOT ONLY WILL YOU HELP SPEED UP PLAY BUT YOU'LL ALSO BE DOING YOUR PARTNER A FAVOR BY HELPING HIM TRY TO LOCATE HIS BALL
AND WE HAVE LEARNED HOW TO CONTROL OUR SPEED EITHER THROUGH THE WEDGE AND CONSTANTLY MATCHING THE SKIS OR THROUGH THE HOCKEY STOP AND A WIDE TRACK PARALLEL THAT YOU LEARNED
HI MY NAME IS OTIS ST CLAIR AND TODAY I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WEIGHT TRAINING FOR INCREASED SPEED
WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TWO MAIN EXERCISES THAT WE CAN DO USING WEIGHTS TO INCREASE OUR SPEED TO BUILD POWER IN OUR LEGS AND GET FASTER
WHEN SOMEONE PURCHASES A SPEEDBOAT THEY WANT TO KNOW THAT THAT BOAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO PUT SOME SPEED BEHIND IT
WHICH IS FIFTY PLUS MILES AN HOUR ON THE WATER WHICH IS RATHER FAST COMPARED TO A KAYAK OR A PONTOON OR A TUGBOAT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT DESIGNED FOR SPEED
WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO START BY HITTING ALL FOUR WALLS AND THEN WE'LL ADD SOME SPOTS IN BETWEEN THAT TO SMOOTH IT OUT A LITTLE BIT AS WE SPEED IT UP
OTHER THAN THAT YOU CAN CHECK THE HARD DISK SIZE AND YOU CAN CHECK THE SPEED OF THAT IT BOOTS UP AND HOW IT SEEMS TO RUN
DOES IT SEEM TO RUN AT AN ACCEPTABLE SPEED TO YOU
FOR BEGINNING NUNCHUCKS BEGINNING SPEED CHUCKS OKAY
ONE MORE INHALE SPEED IT UP
FREQUENTLY CHILDREN WHO HEAR DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SOMETIMES THEY DON'T LEARN EACH LANGUAGE AS QUICKLY BUT USING THE BABY SIGN WILL DEFINITELY BRIDGE THAT GAP AND IT WILL HELP THEM SPEED UP THE UNDERSTANDING
SO WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU AT FULL SPEED HERE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE WHEN HE COMES OVER ON HELP SIDE TO STOP THE DRIVE
I'LL SHOW IT TO YOU AT NORMAL SPEED AND I'LL BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU
PUT LIGHT SHAFT IN YOUR HAND AND YOU WILL CREATE THAT FASTER SPIN SPEED
THIS IS JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO CREATE A FASTER SPIN SPEED
NOW WITH A GRAPH-EYE SHAFT THE LIGHTER THE SHAFT IT'S PROBABLY FOR THE SLOWER SPEED
NUMBER ONE IS YOUR FILM SPEED OR ISO
YOU GOTTA BE ABLE TO LEARN KNOW HOW TO SPIN AND GET A LOT OF SPEED AND MOMENTUM BUILT UP AND THEN KNOW HOW TO LAND ON YOUR FEET AT THE SAME TIME
YOU WANT TO USE A MEDIUM SPEED ON THE DRILL SO THAT YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER IT AND IT'S NOT GOING TOO FAST
WHAT YOU'LL WANT TO DO IS JUST TEST WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU AT THE SPEED THAT YOU'RE ROLLING
HE WANTS TO BUY IT BECAUSE IT LOOKS AND WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS THAT WAY YOU KNOW IT GOES FAST AND YOU KNOW IT HAS SPEED BEHIND IT
A SPEEDBOAT'S MORE DESIGNED FOR SPEED COMFORT RIDE FIFTY TO SIXTY MILE AN HOUR PLUS SPEEDS WHERE OUR PONTOONS ARE GOING TO BE MORE FOR LOUNGING LIKE YOU'RE LOUNGING ON YOUR COUCH WATCHING TV AT HOME GOING FIFTEEN TO TWENTY-FIVE MILES AN HOUR
ANOTHER WAY TO CLEAN THINGS YOU CAN DO THIS WITH THE PENS AS WELL IS TO JUST TAKE A PIECE OF PAPER AND GO LIKE THIS OF COURSE I CAN OPEN THIS UP A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT THAT'S HOW YOU WOULD CLEAN THE INSIDE ALSO WITH THOSE SPEED BALL PENS
I'VE ALSO HAD MY CLIENTS TELL ME THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED SOMETHING SIMILAR WHERE THEY MIGHT BE SO FOCUSED ON THEIR RACE AND MAYBE NOT EVEN IN THE RACE IT CAN BE EVEN WHEN YOU ARE DOING LIKE TRAINING OR SPEED WORK ON THE TRACK OR THEY ARE GOING OUT FOR A LONG TRAINING RUN AND THEY EXPERIENCE A RUNNER'S KIND OF HIGH
SO YOU WANT TO CREAM THIS ON MEDIUM SPEED FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES
SO WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO STAY IN THE FUN ZONE OF YOUR WIND SPEED
YOU'RE KIND OF MOVING YOUR HIPS A LITTLE BIT AS YOU GET FASTER SO BE RELAXED WITH YOUR HIPS JUST KIND OF BE AWARE OF THEM AS YOU'RE DOING THAT MOVEMENT AND YOU CAN BASICALLY DO IT ANY SPEED TO FIT ANY OF THE DRUM RHYTHMS THAT ARE BEING PLAYED AT THAT TIME
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN WHERE TO PLACE YOUR FEET ON THE BOARD AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN THE PROPER SPEED AND YOU NEED TO KNOW THE NICE FLAT SMOOTH SURFACE TO TRY IT ON
STARTING OUT SLOW AND THEN WE WILL INCREASE THE SPEED AND WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF ROOM TO WORK WITH SO WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO ILLUSTRATE IS HE IS GOING TO MOVE AROUND ACTUALLY IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO MOVE AROUND AND HE IS GOING TO FOLLOW ME AROUND AND TRY AND MAINTAIN THIS POSITION
NOW WE'RE GOING TO SPEED IT UP A LITTLE BIT
THEY GET YOU SOME GOOD SPEED
DEMO THE BOW SPEED KIND OF THINK OF AS GOING ALONG NOT ONLY WITH THE DYNAMICS BUT WITH THE PARTICULAR PATTERNS AND THAT PART OF THE MUSIC
YOUR BOW SPEED IS GOING TO CHANGE DRAMATICALLY AND IT'S GOING TO BECOME VERY VERY FAST
WE ARE GOING TO START A ZERO TODAY SO THAT WE SLOWLY GO THROUGH AND SHOW YOU MORE OF THE STRATEGY AND THEN WE WILL PICK IT UP TO BE THE SPEED
I'M GOING TO START OUT AT A VERY LOW SPEED
WE CAN CHANGE EVEN THAT NUMBER BY THE INCLINE THAT WE USE WITH THE TREADMILL RAISE THE INCLINE UP TURN THE SPEED CONTROL UP
I HAVE A SENSE OF HOW FAST IT WOULD BE FROM HALFWAY AND THEN I TRY TO PUTT IT TO THAT HALFWAY POINT WITH THE RIGHT SPEED
AGAIN AIM ISN'T NEARLY AS IMPORTANT AS SPEED
WHEN YOU COME UP YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE CORRECT SPEED LIKE I TALKED ABOUT IN THE LAST CLIP
THERE IS NO PROOF THAT IT WILL SPEED UP YOUR METABOLISM IN ANY WAY
YOU SHOULD KNOW THE FASTER THE CLUBBING SPEED THE EASIER IT IS TO GET THAT BALL UP IN THE AIR
THIS MACHINE ACTUALLY HAS A SPEED ADJUSTMENT SO I CAN ADJUST THE SPEED THAT I NEED TO GRIND AT
SO UP TO SPEED IT WOULD SOUND LIKE THIS DEMO
THAT SANDING COAT WILL WANT TO BE OUT HERE A LITTLE LONGER BUT YOU KNOW THERE IT IS WE SPEED IT UP COME OVER HERE AND WE'LL PUT SOME HOT COAT RESIN ON THERE
THERE IS NO OTHER SPEED BALL COURSE OR MOGUL'S COURSE LIKE IT THAT WE CAN FIND ANYWHERE AND ONCE IT IS FINISHED IT WILL BE PROBABLY THE HARDEST COURSE IN CENTRAL TEXAS TO PLAY
I'M GOING TO TURN THE SPEED UP JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE
AND HE MUST BE IN FULL SPEED WHILE PASSING THIS BATON
ALSO ANOTHER QUICK POINT TO MENTION IN THE FOUR X 100 IS THAT YOU HAVE TO GET THE BATON SAFELY AROUND THE TRACK WHICH IS A 400-METER LAP AND SOMETIMES THE LACK OF SPEED COMPENSATE FOR BASIC BATON EXCHANGES
UM ONE OF THE JUMP ROPES WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT IS THE PLASTIC SPEED ROPE
SO HERE'S WE'RE GOING TO SPEED IT TAKE THE TEMPO UP JUST A LITTLE BIT FROM WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING
SO TO PLAY IT UP TO SPEED
