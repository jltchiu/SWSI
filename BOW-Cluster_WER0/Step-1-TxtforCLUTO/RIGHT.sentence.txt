HI MY NAME IS BRANDON SARKIS ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE.  TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE HOLIDAY PUDDING.  OKAY SO NOW YOU CAN SEE THAT WE'VE GOT A MIXTURE THAT LOOKS KIND OF LIKE LOOKS LIKE MUFFIN BATTER ACTUALLY.  SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR MOLASSES NOW AND WE'RE GOING TO ADD ALL OF THAT IN AT ONCE.  AND YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE YOUR SPATULA AROUND.  AND IT DOESN'T MATTER MY SPATULA HAS GOT FLOUR ON IT ALREADY BECAUSE BECAUSE IT'S ALL THE SAME MIXTURE.  YOU KNOW IF THIS WERE A DIFFERENT INGREDIENT I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY GET A DIFFERENT SPATULA.  BUT SINCE ALL THAT'S IN THERE IS THE YOU KNOW ALL THAT THE SPATULA'S TOUCHED IS EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE PRODUCT OR EVERYTHING IS ALREADY IN THE END PRODUCT IT REALLY MAKES NO DIFFERENCE.  SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET ALL OF YOUR MOLASSES THERE WE GO.  THAT IS ALL OF MY MOLASSES.  AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO RAISE THE BOWL BACK UP AND SLOWLY STIR THAT IN.  AND IT MAKES KIND OF A GOOPY MESS.  AND IT'S GOING TO END UP LOOKING LIKE A KIND OF LIKE A REALLY DARK THICK RUNNY LIKE PANCAKE BATTER ALMOST.  YOU WANT IT TO REACH THE RIGHT TEXTURE AND CONSISTENCY.  LET'S TURN IT UP A LITTLE BIT.  OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO LET THIS GO UNTIL THERE ARE NO LUMPS IN IT WHICH WILL PROBABLY TAKE SEVERAL MINUTES.  SO I WILL COME BACK WHEN IT'S REACHED THAT POINT AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT STEP THEN.  OKAY SO IT'S BEEN A FEW MINUTES.  YOU CAN SEE THAT WE'VE GOT NO LUMPS IN THERE TO SPEAK OF.  SO NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS I'VE ALREADY SCRAPED IT DOWN TOO I'M JUST GOING TO VERY SLOWLY ADD MY MILK IN.  I'M TALKING LIKE AT A TRICKLE.  AND WHAT THIS IS DOING IS
YOU KEEP YOUR ARMS RIGHT AT SHOULDER LEVEL RIGHT AND YOU ESTABLISH A WIDE BASE
SEE THIS RIGHT HERE
THIS TEST PROCESS TAKES FIVE MINUTES BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S SHOWING A NICE PRETTY BLUE COLOR
ALSO WHILE IT WAS SAUTEEING FOR THE TEN MINUTES I WAS ABLE TO CLEAN UP THE KITCHEN AND WHEN I COME BACK WE'RE GOING TO SIT DOWN AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO GARNISH THIS REAL EASY AND IT'S A GREAT DISH JUST RIGHT BEFORE FOOTBALL SEASON OR RIGHT BEFORE THE GAME OR LUNCH
IF YOU HAVE FRESH PEPPER THAT IS GREAT IF YOU DON'T USE WHAT YOU HAVE AND BASICALLY SOME FRESH PEPPER RIGHT ON THE TOP
YOU WANT TO GO WITH THE ONES THAT PULL RIGHT OUT OF THE TOP
LET ME GET THAT RIGHT THERE
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GET IT JUST RIGHT BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO FIND THAT SWEET SPOT
FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS TAKE OUR HAND STRAIGHT DOWN AT OUR SIDE RIGHT OUTSIDE OF OUR HIP
RIGHT THERE AND THEN BACK DOWN
IF YOU'RE REALLY DESPERATE AND WANT TO GET OUT OF IT RIGHT A WAY THE BEST THING IS SWIM PARALLEL TO THE BEACH WAVING YOUR ARMS AND YELLING
AND SCREWS WILL GO RIGHT INTO THE LITTLE PLASTIC INSERT THERE
AND THEN THE SECOND LOOP YOU DON'T BRING RIGHT THREW THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST LOOP YOU JUST DO IT CLOSE BY
I STILL DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD WAY TO WARM UP AND KIND OF GET FOCUSED AND GET INTO THE RIGHT MODE FOR PLAYING
AND THEN YOU KNOW WHEN THE RIGHT PROPORTION OF CHESS BOARD TO CHESS SET
THAT'S WHERE THEY GET THIS MOVE FROM THIS LITTLE THING RIGHT HERE THAT'S WHERE THEY GET THAT FROM
RIGHT THERE AND WERE GOING TO LET OUT JACK COLLAPSE ALL THE WAY AND ROLL IT OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE
RIGHT HERE IS YOUR LOWER CONTROL ARM AND IT BEARS MOST OF THE WEIGHT FOR THE SUSPENSION ITS MADE OF A HEAVY GAGE STAMPED METAL AND ITS STURDY ENOUGH TO HOLD THE VEHICLE UP
THERE S A CUT OUT IN YOUR JACK STAND CUP AND WERE GOING TO SLIP THAT LIP RIGHT ON TO THE CUT OUT
RIGHT THERE YOU CAN GET A REALLY GOOD LOOK AT THIS ONE ON THIS SIDE
LET'S JUST JUMP RIGHT IN
I'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO GET EFFECTS BY TAKING SOME OF THE WAX PUTTING IT RIGHT ON THE GRIDDLE OVER HERE
YOU'RE OPENING UP YOUR RIGHT HAND JUST A LITTLE BIT AND MOVING YOUR RIGHT HAND THE BACK OF THE SPOON COMES RIGHT OUT OF YOUR HAND JUST LIKE THAT
BUT THIS THIS RIGHT HERE AND THIS ALONG HERE THESE HEMS ARE EXTREMELY VALUABLE
IF YOU DON'T SEE AUTO FILL ALREADY ON YOUR LIST HERE SELECT THE TWO LITTLE ARROWS POINT TO THE RIGHT FIND AUTO FILL AND AS YOU COULD SEE MY DAVE PROFILE IS SHOWING UP RIGHT THERE
SO RIGHT HAND IS GOING TO PULL IN THIS WAY HER LEFT FOOT STEPS FORWARD TO HER RIGHT FOOT BRINGING HER FEET TOGETHER
AT THIS POINT THE RIGHT HAND IS GOING TO FIRE OUT LIKE THE BEGINNING OF THE TANTUI PUNCHING FORWARD AND OUT
SO HER RIGHT KNEE IS UP CRANE HER RIGHT ARM IS IN ROLLING BLOCK AND LEFT HAND IS OUT TO THE SIDE
AGAIN SHE'S GOING TO ALLOW THE RIGHT FOOT TO DROP STRAIGHT DOWN HEEL TOE STEP OUT BOW
NOW TO FINISH IT THE RIGHT HAND IS GOING TO CHAMBER SAME TIME AS HER LEFT FOOT STEPS UP
A LOT OF THE DEMO HOUSES LIKE WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW COUNTY Q LARRY BEER PRODUCTIONS THOSE HOUSES DO A GREAT DEAL OF BUSINESS AND AT A VERY REASONABLE RATE
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A LEFT HANDER BATTER IN AGAINST A LEFT HANDER PITCHER YOU MAY WANT TO PINCH HIT A RIGHT HANDER PINCH HITTER TO PLAY THE NUMBERS
GENERALLY RIGHT HANDERS WILL HAVE A BETTER BATTING AVERAGE IN THAT SITUATION
SO THAT WHOLE STACK OF BRICKS RIGHT THERE IS THE DOOR AND THAT TAKES QUIET A WHILE
FROM POSITION SIX WHICH IS A CLOSED HIP POSITION WE CAN GO RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS SUNSALUTE TO A BALANCING POSE JUST FOR FUN
SHOULDERS ARE AWAY FROM THE EARS FINGER TIPS GO RIGHT BACK UP TOWARDS THE CEILING
WHEN YOU TAKE THEM OUT OF THE DRYER THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE INSIDE OUT BECAUSE YOU WASH THEM INSIDE OUT TO RETAIN THE COLOR SO YOU'LL TURN THOSE RIGHT SIDE IN OR RIGHT SIDE OUT

ONCE YOU GET IT IN CONTACT WITH THE SOIL AND IF YOU HAVE GOOD SOIL TO SEED CONTACT AND YOU PUT MOISTURE ON IT THE SEED SHOULD GERMINATE UNDER THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE CONDITION SHOULD GERMINATE AND FORM A NEW PLANT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE IT A LITTLE BIT UNDER THE GROUND
IF IT'S EASY IT'S NOT DONE RIGHT SO STAY ENGAGED ROTATE HEEL UP SWITCH HEEL DOWN AND AGAIN HEEL UP HEEL DOWN

IT'S RIGHT THERE IN MY MUSIC LIBRARY READY FOR ME TO PICK UP AND DO IT
USED TO HAVE A BOW LINE OR STERN LINE WE TEND TO HAVE MOST OF OUR BOATS OUTFITTED WITH A STERN LINE WHICH IS RIGHT ON THE BACK OF THE BOAT HERE

I'M GOING TO DO THAT FOR ABOUT FIVE OR SIX SECONDS FOR A LATTE THEN I'M GOING TO SUBMERGE THE STEAM WAND AGAIN INTO THE MILK AND GET IT SWIRLING AGAIN UNTIL AND KEEP IT SWIRLING UNTIL IT REACHES THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE
OF COURSE WE NEED PORK CHOPS AND WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF NICE THICK ONES RIGHT HERE WHICH WE ARE GOING TO CUT UP

IF YOU KEEP THE POSITIONS OF THE ARM SIMPLE THEN THESE ARMS I ONLY DREW HALF OF THEM THEY CAN GO THEY'RE RIGHT DOWN BY THE SIDES HIT MID-THIGH BUT THEY CAN BE BROUGHT UP AND IT ALL GOES ALONG THE ARC

FOR THIS I'M JUST GOING TO SAY I WANT IT RIGHT HERE IN THIS AREA AND YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO TAKE YOUR DRILL PLACE IT ON THAT MARK APPLY A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE TO IT AND THEN YOU JUST WANT TO DRILL AWAY
SO THERE IS A LOT MORE VARIABLES IN THE STAIRS ALONE THAN PROBABLY THE HIP OR THE JUMP OVER THERE AND THIS IS WHERE IT STARTS TO GET DIFFICULT RIGHT HERE I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY
THIS IS A VERY COMFORTING AND LOVING TOUCH RIGHT HERE WHERE YOU'RE JUST LETTING THE PERSON KNOW THAT ONE YOU CARE AND TWO IT'S OKAY TO RELAX
YOU THROW AND YOU'LL NOTICE HOW MY HAND QUICKLY JUST CAME RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE YOYO
AND BRINGS THE BONE OF HIS FORE ARM RIGHT UNDERNEATH MY LEG
YOUR RIGHT FOOT TURNS OUT YOUR LEFT FOOT TURNS IN
TO START WITH YOUR FEET ARE AT A SHOULDER DISTANCE YOU'RE GOING TO TURN YOUR BODY TO THE RIGHT AS YOU'RE TURNING TO THE RIGHT YOUR RIGHT HEEL TURNS AND YOUR LEFT FOOT TURNS ON THE BALL OF THE FOOT

SO WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS RIGHT AFTER WE'VE PLANTED OUR PLANT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OURSELVES A LITTLE EARTHEN DAM A FEW INCHES DEEP SO THAT THE WATER THAT WE PUT IN HERE AT THE BASE OF THE PLANT STAYS HERE
YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR HAND RIGHT WHERE THE MIDDLE IS AND YOU'RE GOING TO USE MOSTLY USE YOUR TWO FINGERS FOR PINCHING WHEN YOU DO SPINS AND STRIKES
WE'RE GOING TO HOLD IT RIGHT ABOVE THE TOP
THEN I WANT TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF A HIGHLIGHT IN THE CORNER OF THE EYE SO I'M GOING TO TAKE THE SAME COLOR THE SHIMMERY COLOR THAT I USED AS A BASE AND I'M GOING TO PUT THAT RIGHT IN THE CORNER OF HER EYE
AND I JUST PUT IT RIGHT HERE UNDERNEATH THE PLEXI-GLASS
RIGHT NOW WE ARE GOING TO GO TO THE HELP DEPARTMENT AND THEY DO HAVE A LARGE DEPARTMENT THERE AT WEBSITES ONE THAT YOU CALL 24 HOURS A DAY TO GET HELP BUT IF YOU'D RATHER USE THE DOCUMENTATION SECTION OF THE HELP IT'S RIGHT HERE ON THE HELP BUTTON AND THERE'S ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT THERE'S FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS HERE ON THE LEFT THAT YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IS THERE A COUNTER ON MY WEBSITE HOW COME MY IMAGE WON'T WORK

BUT ONE OF THOSE THINGS THOSE INSTRUCTORS MIGHT HAVE SAID TO YOU IS OUT OF ABOUT THIRTY OF YA OUT THERE RIGHT NOW THERE MIGHT BE THREE THAT END UP BEING GREAT REALTORS
BUT IF WE GO IN HERE AND WE COULD DO P-ALIGN AND AS OPPOSED TO OUR LEFT RIGHT OR CENTER WE'LL JUST TYPE JUSTIFY
WE HAVE OF COURSE THE SABRE IN HER RIGHT HAND HER GLOVE HER LAME WHICH IS FOR SCORING
I'M PINCHING WITH MY LEFT HAND AND PULLING UP AND COMPRESSING WITH MY RIGHT HAND WITH THE SPONGE FROM THE TOP DOWN

AND SO RIGHT NOW THIS TABLE IF YOU LOOK THE WORDS DON'T BUMP ALL THE WAY UP AGAINST THE LEFT HAND SIDE
IF I WERE TO TAKE THAT DOWN TO ZERO SAVE IT AND REFRESH THIS LOOK ALL MY TEXT IS BUMPED RIGHT UP AGAINST IT
THE WEIGHT HERE I SHOULD BRING MY WEIGHT FORWARD TO THIS KNEE SO THAT MY KNEE AND MY ANKLE ARE RIGHT ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER
SO TO GET TO THE BACK CORNER AND TO REITERATE EVERYTHING WE JUST TALKED ABOUT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT RIGHT FOOT LEFT FOOT RIGHT FOOT AND THAT PUTS YOU IN A GOOD POSITION OR IF YOU GO WITH THE THREE STEP YOU ARE GOING TO GO LEFT RIGHT LEFT
THIS RIGHT HERE WOULD PROBABLY BE MY MAIN LINE

IF YOU'RE A LEFT HANDER YOU MAY WANT TO START ON THE LEFT SIDE AS IT'S PROBABLY EASIER TO WORK LEFT TO RIGHT FOR YOU GUYS
MOVE OVER TO THE NEXT SECTION AND MIRROR THE LINE THAT I CREATED ON THE RIGHT SIDE FOR THE LEFT SIDE
SINCE I'M RIGHT HANDED AND I WORK RIGHT TO LEFT I'LL GO BACK TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND CREATE ANOTHER HORIZONTAL LINE SUB SECTIONING MY RIGHT BACK SECTION
STANDING TO THE LEFT OR STANDING TO THE RIGHT MIGHT ACTUALLY INCREASE MY FINGER ANGLE OR GIVE ME MORE OF A SHORT TO LONG OR A LONG TO SHORT TYPE OF EFFECT

SO JUST WAIT TILL THAT DISK COMES RIGHT AROUND IN A PERFECT ANGLE SET IT DOWN WIND AND YOU'LL CATCH IT EVERY TIME
THAT IS JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED TO KEEP IN MIND WHENEVER YOU ARE PLAYING RIGHT AROUND THAT HALF COURT LINE
KEEPING IN MIND THAT YOU GUYS WILL ALWAYS ALWAYS BE WITHIN THE REGULATIONS IF YOU KEEP THESE RULES EACH OF THESE RULES I AM TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW IN MIND WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING BASKETBALL
ONE OTHER THING WHEN YOU TALKING ABOUT THE HALF COURT LINE IT COMES ACROSS RIGHT ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE COURT
THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS YOU GRAB THE ARM WITH BOTH OF YOUR ARMS AND YOU DROP YOUR WEIGHT DOWN INTO THE HORSE STANCE RIGHT AWAY IT FORCES THE PERSON DOWN AND THAT IS A HARD POSITION FOR THEM TO MAINTAIN THEIR HOLD
MAKE SURE OUR HAND ARE LOOSE AND EVERYTHING RIGHT
IF YOU CAN FEEL THE WIRE COMING THROUGH IT'S ALL RIGHT BUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO FROM HERE IS SMOOTH OUT THE TONGUE INSIDE OF THE MOUTH SO THAT IT SORT OF BECOMES ONE UNIT
THIS STEP THAT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU NOW IS THE RIGHT TURN
HERE COMES THE RIGHT TURN
IF YOU DON'T PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THIS IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS JUST ONE WAY TO PUT IT AROUND THE DOG BUT THERE IS A RIGHT AND WRONG WAY
NOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL BRAID JUST SPRAY RIGHT ALONG DOWN THE BRAID AND THEN RUB IT DOWN JUST TO TRY TO GET THOSE LITTLE STRAY HAIRS
WHAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS A ONE FOOT IN AND A TWO FOOT IN HEEL SLIDE
SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO PRACTICE GOING FROM THE TIP TO THE FROG
IN THIS CASE YOU HAVE THE CAMPSITE THAT'S DESIGNATED AS SITE FIVE YOU HAVE KIND OF NICE CLEARLY LAID OUT AREA THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR CAMPING AND YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR CAMPING ACTIVITIES RIGHT WITHIN THIS AREA AND NOT GO OUTSIDE THEM
AS THE YOYO'S COMING DOWN AS I THROW IT I'M PINCHING HERE AND I'M QUICKLY BRINGING MY THROW HAND WHICH IS THIS HAND HERE RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE YOYO
YOU GO DIRECTLY TO THE ITUNES STORE LISTED UNDER STORE RIGHT HERE IN YOUR ITUNES INTERFACE CHOOSE OR SEARCH YOUR FAVORITE MUSIC PUT IN YOUR CREDIT CARD UNLESS THEY HAVE A FREE OFFERING WHICH THEY DO FROM TIME TO TIME OR YOUR GIFT CARD AND BOOYAH
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE BOTH AND LAY THEM DOWN HERE ON THE TABLE SAW AND PUSH THEM RIGHT CLOSE UP NEXT TO THE FENCE
RIGHT NOW I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF GLASS THAT SEEM VERY SIMILAR
A LOT OF TIMES TOO YOU SEE THIS EXCESS STUFF ON THE EDGE YOU JUST SIMPLY JUST TAKE YOUR FINGER AND IT COMES RIGHT OFF JUST LIKE THAT YOU GIVE A LITTLE PRESSURE TO IT IT'S REALLY NOT A BIG DEAL
AND WE'RE GOING TO FLIP IT OVER AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO START PUSHING RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE
LET'S TAKE IT TRAVELING STEPPING RIGHT FOOT
THIS TIME THE RIGHT FINGER SKIPS A NOTE AND GOES UP TO THE B
SO THIS IS LIKE WHAT'S USED IN YOUR GUITAR RIGHT
ACTUALLY I'LL SHOW YOU RIGHT HERE
IF WE KIND OF PLUG IT IN THERE YOU CAN SEE THAT CONTACT GOES IN RIGHT THERE
SO I'LL WRAP MY YARN AROUND GO RIGHT UNDERNEATH IT PULL MY YARN THROUGH
SO REACH UP AND OVER TOWARDS YOUR RIGHT SIDE
ALL RIGHT NOW I'M IN DARKNESS I'M GOING TO START TO BRING IT UP
YOU CAN HEAR IT PUNCHING IT RIGHT HERE
DEPENDING ON WHAT PART OF THE COUNTRY YOU'RE IN YOU MAY HAVE TONS OF CLAY ALL AROUND YOU AND MAYBE RIGHT UNDER YOUR GRASS IN YOUR FRONT YARD JUST UNDER THE TOPSOIL OR YOU MAY HAVE TO DIG A LITTLE DEEPER OR YOU MAY NOT HAVE ANY AT ALL BUT SUFFICED TO SAY THAT STREAM BEDS AND LAKE BEDS ARE GOOD PLACES TO START LOOKING WHICH IS WHY I'VE IDENTIFIED THIS AREA HERE BECAUSE THIS STREAM CUT HAS LESS TOPSOIL IN IT ALREADY IT'S GOT THE BANK IS KIND OF CUT SO I CAN START DIGGING RIGHT HERE AND SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND
NOW UP TO THIS POINT WE'VE LOOKED AT HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN CLAY BODY BASED ON HIGHLY PROCESSED INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS BUT BECAUSE CLAY IS A NATURALLY OCCURRING SUBSTANCE AND IT EXISTS RIGHT IN THE GROUND WE CAN DIG IT OUT OF THE GROUND AND USE IT AS IS
I NEED TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE GRINDING RIGHT THERE
LET'S GET THIS THROUGH RIGHT HERE
AND YOUR PARTNER WANTS TO YOU WANT YOUR PARTNER TO FLEX THEIR FOOT AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUT YOUR HAND ON THE MEATY PART OF THE CALF MUSCLE AS THEY FLEX UP AND USE RIGHT THERE THAT POINT OF ATTACHMENT IN THE HAMSTRING AND RELEASE
NOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND IS WE'RE GOING TO USE OUR FIRST AND SECOND FINGERS AND WE'RE GOING TO ALTERNATE THEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HOLD THEM CROSSWAYS TO THE STRING LIKE SO

THE CAT IS JUST PERCHED ON THE TOILET AND POOPING RIGHT INTO THE TOILET
IF YOUR CAT IS COMFORTABLE WITH THAT LITTLE HOLE WHICH IS A BIG STOPPING POINT FOR A LOT OF CATS THEN YOU CAN START MAKING THE HOLE A LITTLE BIGGER A LITTLE BIGGER A LITTLE BIGGER AND BASICALLY THE IDEA IS AND YOU CAN USE A LITTLE PICK UP SOMETHING AT THE HARDWARE STORE TO LINE THE INSIDE OF THE HOLE SO THE LITTER DOESN'T FALL RIGHT THROUGH BUT AS IT GETS BIGGER AND BIGGER THE GOAL IS TO GET IT BIG ENOUGH SO THAT THERE IS JUST A LITTLE BIT OF LITTER ON THE OUTSIDE AND THEN THERE IS NO LITTER AT ALL
ANYWHERE FROM YOUR WEDGES TO YOUR DRIVERS AND WHICH LENGTH IS RIGHT FOR YOU
YOU WANT TO COME UP BACKWARDS RIGHT BEFORE YOU GET TO THE BAR YOU WANT TO PUT ALL OF YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR BACK FOOT SLAMMING THE TAIL INTO THE PLATFORM YOUR WHEELS AND TRUCKS INTO THE COPING GIVING YOU THIS LOCKED IN POSITION AND IT SHOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WHEN YOU DO IT PROPERLY

SO FOR YOUR NEXT DOUBLE STOP WE'RE LOOKING AT THE F AND C SO FOR SECOND POSITION YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE STARTING IN SECOND ON YOUR D STRING ON YOUR F SO YOU CAN SLIDE UP TO F AND THE C IS RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE F SO THIS IS GIVING YOU A CHANCE TO LEARN TO PLAY DOUBLE STOP WHERE YOUR FIRST FINGER IS GOING PRACTICE HOLDING DOWN TWO STRINGS AT ONCE ON THE FINGER PAD
SO AS OPPOSED TO JUST PLAYING THE ONE ALONE BY ITSELF WHERE THE STRING IS AND RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF THE FINGER PAD NOW YOU'RE ALLOWING BOTH STRINGS TO BE PLAYED ALL AT ONCE
YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HEARTH IS NICE AND CLEAN AND THAT THERE IS NO FLAMMABLE MATERIALS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE FIREPLACE

SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO RIGHT IN THIS BOX RIGHT HERE WE'RE GOING TO ADD SOME VIDEO TO IT
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OUR PRODUCT PAGE UP
IF YOU WANTED TO CUT THE BALL TO THE LEFT IN A CUTTER FASTBALL YOU'D POSITION YOUR FINGERS ON THE LEFT HALF OF THE BALL TO CREATE SPIN AND MOVEMENT THAT WOULD MAKE THE BALL BASICALLY CURVE TO THE RIGHT
IF YOU WANT TO CUT THE BALL TO THE RIGHT AND YOU'RE A RIGHT HANDED PITCHER YOU WOULD CUT THE BALL IN HALF AND POSITION BOTH FINGERS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BALL
THE CUTTER IS ACCOMPLISHED BY EITHER CUTTING THE BALL TO THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT
RIGHT NOW I'M ACTUALLY IN THE NFL DRAFT
AND I KNOW IT CAN LOOK KIND OF FUNNY WITH ALL THESE LAYERS GOING DOWN RIGHT NOW BUT IT'S COMING TOGETHER REALLY GOOD
SO I'M RIGHT HANDED SO I'M GOING TO STEP FIRST WITH MY RIGHT FOOT SO I TAKE A TWO STEP APPROACH RIGHT LEFT BEND DOWN PUT MY HANDS BEHIND ME PALMS FACING UP AND THEN ONCE I'M DOWN BRING MY HANDS UP TO BRING ME UP HIGHER ABOVE THE GROUND AND THEN I'M GOING TO DROP MY ELBOW LEAD WITH MY LEFT ARM AND SWING THROUGH THE BALL
SO WHEN YOU DEPENDING ON WHAT IF YOU ARE LEFT HANDED OR RIGHT HANDED YOU ARE GOING TO STEP WITH THE OPPOSITE FOOT
SO JUST REMEMBER AFTER THAT NINTH ONE YOU STEP LEFT AS A PREP STEP STEP BUT YOUR BIG STEPS ARE RIGHT AND LEFT AND THEN YOUR STRING PULL
WE'RE GOING TO GO RIGHT LEFT AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE OF THOSE STRING PULLS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER SO THE RHYTHM IS JUST GOING TO GO ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE

THIS IS ACTUALLY HOW IT HANGS IS RIGHT LIKE THAT WHEN IT'S GROWING
NOW RELEASE THAT GUIDE THE FLOOR RIGHT AWAY FROM YOU COME ALL THE WAY BACK UP
AND TAKE IT TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE WHERE THE LEFT FOOT GOES OUT OFF THE SIDES OF THE MAT TAKE THAT KNEE RIGHT DOWN INTO THE MAT
NOW YOU CAN TAKE THIS A LITTLE BIT DEEPER BY TAKING THAT LEFT FOOT IN AND TAKE THAT LEFT HAND AROUND THAT LEFT FOOT NOTE THE SHOULDER GO RIGHT BACK TOUCH THE FLOOR WITH THE RIGHT HAND LOOKING UP BREATH IN DEEP TO YOUR NOSE AND EXHALE
TAKE THE HANDS TO THE SIDES OF THE MAT EDGE THE RIGHT HEEL RIGHT BACK BRING YOUR HIP RIGHT BACK TO THE CENTER SO YOU'RE NOT LEANING OVER TOWARDS THE LEFT
GETS REALLY GELLY SO I'LL GO THROUGH THAT STEP AND THE PROCESS OF ALL OF THAT RIGHT IN THE NEXT STEPS
AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO CUT IN A STRAIGHT LINE RIGHT ALONG THE EDGE HERE
IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE GETTING IT IN IF YOU DIDN'T USE A THICK ENOUGH CORRUGATED PAPER YOU CAN TWIST THE STICK BACK AND FORTH AND IT WILL SLIDE IN OR YOU CAN JUST PRESS IT DOWN ONTO A HARD SURFACE BECAUSE THE STICK SHOULD FIT RIGHT INTO RUN ALONG THE LINES OF THE CORRUGATED PAPER

RIGHT RIGHT FOOT PLANTS OUT LOADS UP
SO HE LOADS OUT WITH THAT RIGHT FOOT AND THEN RIGHT IN THERE
AND THERE'S AN EFFORT TO REACH THE HIP RIGHT THROUGH YOUR BABY FINGER SO WE'RE NOT HERE BUT ACTIVELY REACHING
AND THEN THE FACT THAT IT'S WITH FACING MEANS THAT THIS LINE OF YOUR NECK THEN BECOMES THE STITCH LINE FOR A PIECE MIRRORING THIS TO BE PLACED ON TOP RIGHT SIDE TO RIGHT SIDE STITCHED ALONG THE HEART AND THEN FLIPPED INSIDE OUT FLIPPED INTO THE INTERIOR OF IT AND THEN IRONED ALONG THIS LINE WHICH JUST ALLOWS FOR A CLEAN FINISH AND ALLOWS FOR THE SHAPE TO BE RETAINED WITHOUT STRETCHING OUT THE FABRIC
MAKE SURE YOU CATCH THEM RIGHT AWAY
WHAT I'M ACTUALLY DOING ON THIS IS PUTTING MY HAND IN THE CROOK OF HIS ELBOW AND COLLAPSING IT TO CAUSE PRESSURE RIGHT HERE
THERE'S A LOT OF BUILDUP THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE YOU IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T SEE AND SO YOU DON'T CLEAN IT RIGHT
HE'S LOWER RIGHT NOW THAN THE DEFENSIVE PLAYER

IT'S GOING TO HAVE SOME GLARE OFF OF THAT APPLE RIGHT THERE
SO MAKE SURE YOU GO THE RIGHT WAY HERE AND ANOTHER QUICK SHORTCUT IS IF YOU HOLD DOWN THE SPACE BAR YOU GET THIS HAND THAT ALLOWS YOU TO NAVIGATE WITHOUT HAVING TO SCROLL
IF I DECIDE I WANT TO DO IT ON ALL OF THESE CORNERS MAKING SURE TO GO THE RIGHT WAY RATHER THAN TO YOU KNOW GOING THIS WAY
I WANT YOU TO OBSERVE IT AGAIN THE OVERLAP POINT RIGHT TOE AND COME BACK INTO THE BASIC

THAT'S GOING TO CUE YOUR HEADPHONES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
THEY DON'T WANT TO DRY OUT TO THE BONE BECAUSE IF IT IS JUST REALLY REALLY DRY SOMETIMES YOU'LL LOSE THEM BUT I HAVE HAD SOME OF THEM JUST DIE BACK BECAUSE YOU HAVE QUIT WATERING THEM AND IT IS MAYBE TOO MUCH SUN AND THEN WHEN IT RAINS IN THE FALL THEY COME RIGHT BACK UP

FROM HERE I'M GOING TO BRING THE FOOT DOWN STEP OUT BOW THE RIGHT HAND PERFORMS SCRAPING BLOCK AND THEN THE BODY SNAPS INTO SIDE PUNCH
SO YOU CAN TELL YOUR CHILD TO SPOT A NUMBER FIVE OR SPOT A NUMBER TWO AND THEN YOU CAN COLLECT ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE AND YOUR CHILD CAN COLLECT THESE NUMBERS ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE
SO OUR LEFT KNEE IS UP THE LEFT HAND IS CHAMBERED RIGHT ARM IS OUT
YOU NOTICE THE YO-YO IS JUST SPINNING RIGHT AT THE END OF THE STRING
REMEMBER THAT EVEN IN THIS POSITION RIGHT WE WANT TO FEEL THIS SHOULDER BACK THIS SHOULDER FORWARD HEAD PRESSING UP
NOW IT ALSO GOES WITH YOUR HAND SIGNS IF YOU THROW UP THIS FOR TWO OUTS AND THEN ON THE VERY NEXT PLAY YOU DO THIS TO MEAN TWO STRIKES RIGHT AWAY YOU'VE GOT THEM CONFUSED AGAIN
WE'LL WIGGLE A LITTLE LEFT AND WE'LL WIGGLE A LITTLE RIGHT AND IT'S GOING TO COME OFF JUST FINE

I COULD PROBABLY SLIDE A SMALL PIECE OF PAPER UNDERNEATH MY HEELS RIGHT NOW EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE MY WEIGHT IS BACK
I'VE GOT SOME WHITE HERE AND I'VE GOT SOME RED AND I'M JUST GOING TO TIE THIS RIGHT HERE IN A BOW
I WOULD FIND THE RIGHT TICKET WITH THE NAME OF THE CUSTOMER BEING GRACE SIPPEL IT'S ONE OF MINE
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN TO DO THAT SO I'M GOING TO BRING THE KNEE ACROSS THRUST IT OUT AND THEN BRING IT RIGHT BACK TO ME
I AM GOING TO BRING THE KNEE RIGHT UNDER MY BODY AND ONCE IT COMES ACROSS THIS FOOT HAS TO PIVOT HARD AND FAR
IT'S THE FIRST PLACE THAT YOU'LL BEGIN TO NOTICE IMBALANCES FROM THE RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR BODY TO THE LEFT SIDE OF YOUR BODY THE FRONT SIDE OF YOUR BODY TO THE BACK SIDE OF YOUR BODY

IT'S REALLY NOT DIFFICULT TO DO THAT AND YOU CAN DO IT RIGHT AT HOME WITHOUT ANY HELP ALL YOU NEED IS SOME MASCARA SOME SPARKLES AND A SPONGE LIKE THIS

BUT YOU KNOW A BIGGER BOARD LIKE THIS WITH THEIR REAL WIDE SURFACE AREA IS GOING TO JUST SHOOT YOU RIGHT UPWIND
ON THIS RIGHT HERE IT'S CALLED A PLACEBO SURF SKATE
ONCE YOU GOTTEN IT RIGHT YOU WILL GO AHEAD AND JUST JUMP IN LET GO OF YOUR FRONT BRAKE AND RIDE AWAY NICE AND SMOOTH

SO WE HAVE ONE TWO HERE'S OUR SHARP TWO RIGHT IF WE HAVE ONE TWO OUR SHARP TWO IS RIGHT THERE
SO I'M GOING TO WRAP MY YARN AROUND AND JUST GO RIGHT UNDERNEATH THAT WHOLE PIECE RIGHT THERE

THE WAY THAT YOU TELL WHAT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FABRIC IS IS THE BOLDER COLOR YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT THIS THE BACK YOU CAN SEE THE COLORS ARE NOT AS VIBRANT AND THIS IS THE FRONT
IT'S A LITTLE MORE OBVIOUS ON SOME FABRICS THAN ON OTHERS SO I'M SURE THOUGH THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHICH IS THE RIGHT SIDE
SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS PUT THE RIGHT SIDE UP LIKE THAT AND THEN GO AHEAD AND MATCH IF YOU HAVE A PATTERN LIKE THIS THAT HAS STRIPES OR ANY SORT OF PATTERN LIKE THIS BE SURE THAT YOU GO AHEAD AND MATCH THEM SO THAT THEY LOOK CORRECT WHEN YOU SEW IT TOGETHER ON BOTH SIDES OF THE PILLOW
RIGHT BECAUSE INSTEAD OF E FLAT WE HAVE E SO THAT'S OUR SHARP TWO MINOR AND THOSE ARE OUR FIRST TWO CHORDS OUR ONE TO OUR SHARP TWO

HOW YOU DETERMINE WHICH SIDE OF THE VEHICLE IT IS YOU PICTURE YOURSELF SITTING BEHIND THE STEERING WHEEL YOUR LEFT HAND IS GOING TO INDICATE THE LEFT SIDE AND YOUR RIGHT HAND IS GOING TO INDICATE THE RIGHT SIDE
IF THEY'RE NOT ON IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO WORK RIGHT
THESE TWO TABS RIGHT HERE
ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS ON SPIDERMAN ONE OF THE MOST NERVE RACKING IS ALWAYS DRAWING IN THE EYES RIGHT
THAT'S A FACTOR RIGHT NOW
TAKE THE RIGHT FOOT AWAY FROM YOU AND TURN YOUR LEFT TOES IN SO THAT YOUR RIGHT HEEL IS IN LINE WITH THAT LEFT ANKLE
TAKE YOUR RIGHT ARM DOWN GET OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BODY BY REACHING UP WITH THAT LEFT HAND
REACHING UP WITH THAT LEFT HAND YOU CAN HOLD IT RIGHT UP HIGH AND YOU CAN LOWER THE RIGHT HAND RIGHT DOWN TOWARDS THAT FLOOR BUT TURN YOUR FACE UP TOWARDS THE LEFT HAND
NOW THAT'S WHERE THAT BLOCK COMES IN HANDY YOU CAN REST YOUR HAND RIGHT UP ON THE BLOCK YOU CAN LAY THE BLOCK DOWN FOR SECURITY OR YOU CAN TAKE YOUR HAND RIGHT DOWN TO THE FOOT BUT IN ANY CASE YOUR EYES STAY ON THAT LEFT HAND
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE YOU CAN NOT CONVINCE THE NON GLARE IS NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO
THERE'S A HALF STEP BETWEEN B AND C SO TO GET THE C YOU CAN JUST SET YOUR THIRD FINGER DOWN RIGHT NEXT TO THE SECOND FINGER AND THEN TO GET THE E YOU'RE GOING TO WANT THE FIRST FINGER ON D AND JUST LIKE IN THE F AND A THIRD YOU KIND OF WANT OF THINK OF YOUR C AS TUNING IT UP TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S IN TUNE WITH THE E AND YOUR E YOU CAN ALSO TUNE WITH OCTAVES
NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO A ROUNDHOUSE TO THE SIDE RIGHT HERE BAM
SO YOU WANT TO GET ONE OF THESE AND AIM FOR THE CENTER RIGHT HERE AREA
SO SAME THING AS THE FIRST ONE YOU'RE GOING TO USE YOUR HIP YOU'RE GOING TO USE A TORQUE YOU'RE GOING TO WHIP IT ALMOST LIKE A WHIP RIGHT INTO THERE JUST LIKE THAT
AGAIN ONE THING YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO IS YOU DO NOT WANT TO HIT THE HIP UNLESS FOR SURE YOU KNOW YOUR FOOT IS LANDING IN THE HIP BONE RIGHT THERE
NOW WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS TAKE THE RECTANGULAR MARQUEE TOOL AND JUST GRAB A SMALL PORTION OF THAT PICTURE JUST BY GOING CREATING THE MARQUEE AND THEN GOING EDIT COPY AND THEN GO AHEAD AND CLOSE THAT IMAGE AND PASTE IT EDIT PASTE RIGHT INTO OUR BACKGROUND PICTURE
IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE ALL THE WAY TO THE GROUND AND YOU ARE GOING TO FEEL THAT TIGHTNESS AND THAT STRETCH RIGHT IN HERE IN YOUR INNER THIGHS
I HAVE CHOPPED UP SOME PARSLEY HERE ABOUT TWO TABLESPOONS OF FRESH PARSLEY IT IS GOING TO GO RIGHT IN THERE
THE RIGHT HAND NUMBER IS THE CREATURE'S TOUGHNESS
SO YOU PUSH OFF YOUR LEFT FOOT ONTO YOUR RIGHT AND YOU THROW
AND YOUR RIGHT LEG PUTS IT RIGHT THROUGH
IT'S THE COMBINATION TIMING THAT PUTS YOU RIGHT THROUGH
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS RIGHT OUT HERE ON THIS EDGE I'M GOING TO CREATE A LITTLE NUBBIN RIGHT THERE AND I'M GOING TO DULL IT UP
THEN I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER AND I'M GOING TO PUT MY FINGERS RIGHT ON THIS EDGE
THEN WHEN I COME DOWN AND STRIKE I'M GOING TO STRIKE RIGHT THERE AND AT THE SAME TIME I'M GOING TO BE PULLING WITH MY FINGERS
THAT'S HOW I'M BEING TAPED RIGHT NOW
NOW INHALE SIT RIGHT UP TALL BRING THOSE KNEES RIGHT IN TOWARDS YOU
AND I'VE GOING TO SAVE THIS AS A GIF FILE RIGHT NOW
AND SO IF YOU SEE RIGHT HERE IN PHOTOSHOP I'VE CREATED THIS YELLOW POLKA DOT IN A WHITE BACKGROUND IT'S FABULOUS AND I'M GOING TO GO UP HERE AND GO FILE AND BOTH PHOTOSHOP AND ILLUSTRATOR HAVE THIS GREAT LITTLE FEATURE CALLED SAVE TO WEB AND THAT WILL AUTOMATICALLY KIND OF JUST LIST OUT THE OPTIONS
THE PNG FILES ARE A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED AND AND YOU HAVE ACTUALLY TO DO SOME CODING TO GET IT BUT GIF IS WHAT WE NEED FOR RIGHT NOW
SO YOUR RIGHT LEG WAS IN THE FRONT NOW MY LEFT LEG IS IN FRONT
SO TOE ON THE FLOOR YOU'RE GOING TO JUMP OVER YOUR RIGHT FOOT OKAY AND LAND IN FRONT OF IT
SO WITH OUR RIGHT FOOT OVER I WANT YOU TO JUMP OVER THE TOP GOOD
THE OTHER THING THAT WILL HELP YOU IS ON THIS PIECE THAT'S GOING ACROSS I'M GOING TO HAVE THE BAMBOO GOING DOWN INTO IT SO AGAIN USING A KNIFE EXACTO KNIFE CUTTING RIGHT INTO THE HOLE CUTTING AN X INTO THE LEAF ON BOTH SIDES SO THAT WHEN YOU PUSH THIS DOWN THROUGH MISSED THE HOLE
BUT WHAT THIS IS DOING YOU'RE SPREADING YOUR TOES GETTING THOSE MUSCLES TO START BEING ACTIVATED AGAIN BECAUSE THEY LOSE THEIR THEIR ABILITY TO MOVE WHEN WE CRAMMED THEM INTO SHOES AND FLUSHING ALL THAT STAGNANT BLOOD OUT OF THE TOES THAT PUSHES IT RIGHT BACK UP INTO YOUR LEGS
SO A DRAW ONCE AGAIN IS TAKING THE BALL FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
IF YOU NOTICE I AM STARTING OFF WITH THE PROPER STANCE AND I WILL BE APPLYING FORWARD PRESSURE TO THE LEFT FOOT THEN FORWARD PRESSURE TO THE RIGHT FOOT
SO IF WE ARE GOING TO BE MAKING A LEFT HILL TURN WE ARE GOING TO BE APPLYING PRESSURE TO THE RIGHT BOOT
OK WHAT THAT IS GOING TO DO IS IT'S GOING TO CREATE AGITATION ON THE WATER LEVEL AND STOP IT FROM GETTING A FILM AND IT'S GOING TO KEEP YOUR CLEAN WATER FROM NOT ENTERING RIGHT BACK INTO YOUR FLUVAL
I CAN CONTROL THE LEVEL THAT IT'S BUSED OUT WITH WITH THIS DIAL RIGHT HERE
SEE LIKE RIGHT NOW I'M GOING AWAY FROM IT AND THE METERS AREA GETTING GOING UP
SO IF I'M GOING THIS WAY AND THE NUMBER OF METERS IS GOING DOWN I KNOW I'M GOING THE RIGHT WAY
IT'S PRETTY CLEVER RIGHT
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO HOLD IT RIGHT HERE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
A CUTICLES PUSHER I HAVE THREE TYPES RIGHT HERE NAIL CLIPPERS CUTICLES CLIPPERS YOU WOULD ALSO NEED YOUR POLISHES THE SHADE THAT YOU DESIRE THE BASE COAT AND YOUR TOP COAT
SO ONCE WE HAVE SET OURSELVES WE'RE GOING TO RAISE OUR RIGHT HAND OR LEFT HAND WHICHEVER IS GOING TO BE YOUR FIRST TO HIT THE FLOOR YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE IT LANDS ON THE TAPE ONE HAND TWO HAND FOOT FOOT
NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS SHOT AND WE'RE GOING TO USE LEFT HAND ENGLISH AND IT SHOULD COME RIGHT OVER PRETTY MUCH TO THAT SAME PIECE OF CHALK
WHERE THE EYE BROW FINISHES AT THE HIGH POINT WHICH IS RIGHT HERE YOU WANT PROBABLY THE SMALLEST AMOUNT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PUT ON
I'D SAY TO MEASURE FROM THE TIP OF YOUR NOSE TO RIGHT THERE
YOU USUALLY FINISH RIGHT THERE WHERE THE HAIRLINE FINISHES AT ABOUT AN ANGLE
FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS PICK THE RIGHT TYPE OF CLEANSER TO GO TO THE RIGHT TYPE OF SURROUND
SQUAT JUMP TURN AND THROW IN YOUR HIPS LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER NOW BOTH LEGS ARE GOING TO BE TUCKED IN THE OTHER ONE'S GOING TO BE TUCKED IN TIGHT RIGHT HERE AND HOOK LANDING ALL THE WAY BACK TO HERE
YOUR HANDS START OUT TO THE RIGHT MY LOWER HAND OR MY LEFT HAND WILL BE DOWN BY MY CENTER MY RIGHT HAND WILL BE EXTENDED NOT LOCKED BUT HAS A NICE GENTLE CURVE TO IT
ALL RIGHT WE'VE LOOKED AT TENKON UNDO WE'VE LOOKED AT FUNUKO UNDO NOW WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT SAYU UNDO
ALL RIGHT IN THIS SECTION OF FREESTYLE THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF STEP NINE AND SO NOW THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO BREATHE YOU WANT TO DO IT ON DIFFERENT COUNTS
THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT I LEARNED WAS HOW TO RESEARCH INFORMATION CAUSE THERE'S REALLY NO RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWERS WHEN THERE COMES WHEN THERE'S GARDENING QUESTIONS
RIGHT TOES BACK BY THE LEFT HEEL SO FEET ARE TOGETHER ALMOST TOGETHER
SO WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUR LEFT FOOT IN FRONT OF OUR RIGHT
NOW FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT YOU KNOW STEADY AND HAVE FEAR OF JUST LOSING ALL THE HAIR YOU CAN CLIP IT RIGHT BY THE EAR RIGHT HERE
SO WITH YOUR FRET HAND AND FOR US LEFTIES BEING OUR RIGHT HAND YOU ESSENTIALLY WANT TO HOLD THE NECK YOU WANT YOUR HANDS JUST KIND OF COMFORTABLY LAYING ACROSS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WITH AN ARCH OVER THE FRET BOARD
SO I'M GOING TO PLACE THIS RIGHT HERE ON THE UPPER LEFT CORNER OF THE SHIRT EYELINE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE THE WORD REDISTRIBUTE
YOU CAN EITHER USE A PAPER CUTTER OR I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS SQUARE BY FOLDING IT DIAGONALLY RIGHT TO THE POINT OVER ON THIS SIDE AND MATCH THE EDGES EXACTLY TO HERE AND THEN JUST FOLD THAT RIGHT IN HALF
THIS WILL PROBABLY TAKE OVERNIGHT TO DRY DEPENDING ON HOW HEAVY THE MATERIAL IS BUT THIS WILL MAKE YOUR CLOTHES LOOK GREAT FOR A LONG TIME YOUR COLORS WON'T FADE MUCH FROM DRYING AND EVEN IF THEY ARE COTTON OR SILK YOU KNOW IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER RIGHT OUT OF THE WASHER YOU CAN JUST HANG THEM HERE OR HANG THEM IN A DOORWAY AND THIS GOES FOR BOTH LIGHTS AND DELICATE CLOTHES
SO ONCE YOU'VE TAKEN YOUR TIME TO PUT THE RIGHT SETTING THE RIGHT DETERGENT AND THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE OF WATER FOR YOUR DELICATE CLOTHES AND ONCE THEY ARE OUT OF THE WASHER AND THE WASHER IS DONE YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE THEM DIRECTLY OUT AND HANG THEM
YOU CAN INCREASE THE PACE OF THIS SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST GOING TO GET IN A NICE RHYTHM
AND THE BEST PART IS IS WHEN YOU GET A SMILEY FACE FOR GETTING ALL OF THE QUESTIONS RIGHT
SHE'S GOING TO LIFT WAY UP ON HER TOES AND BRING HER WEIGHT FORWARD CROWN OF THE HEAD FORWARD AND THEN BRING THIS STRAP RIGHT UNDERNEATH AND RIGHT ALONG THE BRA LINE
SHE'S GOING TO COME FORWARD AND PLACE HER HANDS DOWN RIGHT UNDER HER SHOULDERS
SO WE'VE ALREADY MADE THIS FOR FAITH SO SHE'S GOING TO COME AND PUT THIS ON RIGHT ABOVE HER ELBOWS
SO YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE THE STRAP INTO A LITTLE CIRCLE THAT'S JUST FITS RIGHT ABOVE YOUR ELBOWS
BUT DON'T TELL THEM RIGHT AWAY
LET'S PUT OUR WEIGHT ON OUR LEFT FOOT RIGHT FOOT FORWARD
CALAB LABARDA ALL RIGHT
SO NOW YOU CAN PICK UP THE RIGHT FOOT
AS YOU GET READY TO STEP TOWARDS THE RIGHT BOTH HANDS ARE GOING TO FLIP OVER YOU ARE GOING TO STEP AGAIN HEEL TOE SHIFT THE WEIGHT FORWARD ALL THE WAY TO THE RIGHT LEG
HI MY NAME IS MIKE SANDERS AND I'M GOING TO BE TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT BODY BOARD FOR YOU
THIS TWIST MOVE CAN WORK AS A COUNTER FOR YOUR OTHER PAD SO IF YOU GET A LITTLE BIT QUICKER WITH THIS RIGHT SO AS SHE THROWS SO GO LEAD UP SO THROW A LEAD HOOK FOR ME
NOW SHE IS GOING TO ROLL THE BODY BACK LOAD AND I'M GOING TO STEP BACK AND THIS RIGHT HAND TURNS DOWN LEAD HOOK UPPER CUT
WE HAVE ALSO THE LATEX GLOVES RIGHT HERE
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE FULL SPIN WITH OUR RIGHT STICK LIKE THIS BUT AT THE END OF IT WE'RE GOING TO KICK OUR LEG OVER THE TOP AND THROW UP IN THE MIDDLE
THE TIMING WILL TAKE A LITTLE BIT TO GET USED TO BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO KICK YOU LEG OVER RIGHT UP THAT'S A FAILURE
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DISPLAY FOR YOU RIGHT NOW PLAYING THAT STRUM OVER A BASIC BEAT SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY KIND OF PLAY BUSY ON THE GUITAR STRUM WISE AND YOU KNOW PLAYING OVER A BASIC BEAT SO IT'LL SOUND LIKE A THIS WITH THE DRUM TRACK
IF THAT GETS UNCOMFORTABLE TAKE YOUR RIGHT HAND PLACE IT IN FRONT OF YOUR NECK AND LIFT IT BACK UP
IF IT GETS UNCOMFORTABLE I CAN TAKE THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT HAND AND LIFT THE HOOP UP
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING AT THAT POINT BUT RIGHT NOW THAT POT IS FINISHED FOR NOW UNTIL WE COME BACK AND VARNISH IT
NOW LIKE I JUST SAID THERE ARE SO MANY CHOICES AND SO MANY OPTIONS THESE DAYS FOR BUYING YOUR MASSAGE TABLE BUT THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT ONES ARE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR TABLE IS THE RIGHT SIZE AND TWENTY EIGHT INCHES IN WIDTH TO THIRTY TWO INCHES ARE THE RECOMMENDED WIDTH FOR A MASSAGE TABLE
YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT BOLSTER WHICH IS THE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT SUPPORTS YOUR LOWER BACK
YOU CAN ADD IT IN TO YOUR FORMS OR INTO YOUR COTTAS OR ANYTHING THAT YOU MAKE UP IS JUST TO TAKE THE BO STAFF SPIN IT AROUND AND TAKE ONE HAND OFF CATCH IT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND JUST CONTINUE TO FLIP LEFT OR RIGHT HAND WHICHEVER YOU START OUT WITH
THIS IS AN EMPTY TEA BAG AND SO YOU CAN JUST USE THIS EMPTY TEA BAG AND YOU CAN PUT ANY KIND OF TEA YOU WANT TO DRINK IN THIS TEA BAG SO IT IS A REALLY GREAT TEA BREWING IMPLEMENT AND I'M JUST GOING TO GRAB A TEASPOON HERE HERE'S A TEASPOON AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS GET ONE LEVEL TEASPOON OF OOLONG TEA THAT LOOKS ABOUT RIGHT AND THEN I'LL JUST PUT THAT IN THE TEA BAG LIKE SO AND THEN SHAKE IT AROUND A BIT AND GET IT DOWN TOWARDS THE BOTTOM PUT THAT IN THE MUG AND THEN I'LL JUST ADD HOT WATER TO THE CUP AND IT'S O'KAY IF THE TEA BAG GOES DOWN LIKE THAT IF YOU WANT IT WILL FLOAT RIGHT BACK UP TO THE TOP
YOU BRING YOUR RIGHT LEG BACK YOU WANT ANOTHER NINETY DEGREE ANGLE RIGHT HERE BETWEEN YOUR TWO THIGHS
I KNOW I KEEP SHOWING THIS PURSE BUT IT IS VERY VERY VERSATILE IT IS PRETTY AND IT IS PERFECT FOR A ELEGANT EVENING OUT AND THAT IS WHAT THIS DRESS RIGHT HERE EXPRESSES
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THAT BECAUSE THAT IS RIGHT INSIDE THE SPIDER'S BODY
NOW AS MELISSA INCREASES RIGHT HER ABILITY TO STRIKE HER SPEED AND HER POWER RIGHT WHAT I'LL DO IS AS THE HAND COMES DOWN A LITTLE BIT HARDER NEXT ONE I'LL MEET THE HAND OKAY MEETING THE GLOVE
SHE'S GOING TO BRING IT IN RIGHT LEFT AND GO ON AND TWO
I WILL STEP RIGHT LEFT AS WELL AND DO MY RIGHT ARM AND TWO
AND THEN WHEN IT IS YOUR SPACING IS RIGHT
SAME THING HERE THIS IS A CHALLENGE RIGHT HERE BETWEEN THESE TWO LETTERS THAT'S JUST NATURALLY A BIG SPACE SO SOMEHOW I'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TIGHTEN THAT UP AND I COULD
LIKE I SAID I'VE SET THIS DRUM KIT UP SO MANY TIMES THAT AND WE'LL ADJUST IT LATER IF IT'S NOT THE RIGHT HEIGHT
BUT THERE IS A FEW RIGHT WAYS TO DO IT TOO
SHOOT AND SNAP YOUR WRIST STRAIGHT OUT AND THE YO-YO COMES RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HAND
YOU CHOP SIDEWAYS THERE HOLDING YOUR HAND THIS WAY RIGHT
WE SHOULD LAY THEM OUT ON THE TABLE ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE IN THE RIGHT ORDER AND GET THEM READY TO START MIXING AND MATCHING
WE ARE FILLING UP THESE MOLDS AND I WILL HAVE THIS DONE IN NO TIME SO AFTER THIS IS DONE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU GUYS WHAT TO DO WITH IT NEXT AND SO IN OUR NEXT SEGMENT WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE I'M GOING TO STICK IT TO THE MOLDS TO COOL DOWN
WITH THESE VANILLA CHOCOLATES RIGHT HERE I WAS HEATING UP IT WAS ACTUALLY I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MY LITTLE DISASTER HERE ON THE BOTTLE
AND I PUT ALL MY VANILLA WAFERS INSIDE OF THE BOTTLE AND THE GENIUS THAT I AM AND I GUESS EXPERIENCE AND THE HANDS-ON REALLY TEACHES US AS WE GO BUT I HAD PUT THE GEL AFTER I HAD PUT THE WAFERS IN AND IT WAS STUCK TO THE SIDE OF THE BOTTLE AND I WENT AND CHECKED ON IT IN THE MICROWAVE AND I LOOKED OVER AND MY BOTTLE WAS TOTALLY TOTALLY DISTORTING ITSELF AND SO THAT SPOT THAT I KEEP SHOWING YOU GUYS ON THIS PARTICULAR BOTTLE THAT WAS WHERE MY FOOD COLORING WAS ATTACHED TO THE SIDE OF IT AND IT WAS THE TEXTURE OR WHATEVER THE FOOD COLORING GEL IS MADE OF IT WAS BURNING MY BOTTLE MY BOTTLE WAS WITHERING AWAY IN MY MICROWAVE AND I WAS LUCKY TO CATCH IT IN TIME SO THAT I DIDN'T COMPLETELY DESTROY MY BOTTLE BUT ALL RIGHT SO THANKS FOR LISTENING TO MY SAD STORIES HERE WE GO
AND RIGHT HERE IN MY HAND I HAVE SOME FOOD COLORING AND IT'S THE GEL KIND OF FOOD COLORING
OKAY SO FIRST WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE OFF THERE'S A BOLT RIGHT HERE WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE LOOSEN THIS BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE OFF THE CLAMP ALL THE WAY BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO REUSE IT
SO WHEN YOU DO IT YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU LISTEN TO IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S RIGHT AND IT SOUND THE WAY THAT YOU WANT IT
A FOOT ENTRAPMENT HAPPENS WHEN YOU STAND UP IN THE RIVER LIKE I'M STANDING UP NOW BUT I'D BE IN MOVING CURRENT AND MY FOOT THERE'S A ROCK RIGHT HERE GET STUCK UNDERNEATH THE ROCK
NOW WHAT I WANT TO DO NEXT IS I WANT TO TRY TO COPY SOME PATTERNS SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS GRAB MY CONTROL BUTTON AND HOLD DOWN CONTROL AND COPY THIS PATTERN F SO THIS PATTERN F NOW IS COPIED NOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS PLACE IT TO AN AVAILABLE PART OF OR PLACE IT OVER SOMETHING SO I'M GOING TO GO TO MY D SHARP ACTUALLY I'M GOING TO GO TO MY F SHARP AND PASTE IT RIGHT OVER IT
THE WOLVERINE JIG ARE THESE TWO SECTIONS THAT ARE MOUNTED RIGHT BENEATH THE TWO GRINDING WHEELS AND ON ONE SIDE WE HAVE A FLAT TOOL REST THAT SLIDES IN AND OUT AND UNDER THIS ONE A V-ARM THAT SLIDES IN AND OUT
AGAIN PLACING THE FINGERS WIDE HANDS TO THE FLOOR AND YOUR LEFT KNEE ON THE UPPER TRICEP BACK SIDE OF THE ARM OF THE RIGHT ARM
SO BRING UP THE RIGHT LEG
SO AS WE'VE STEPPED BACK WITH OUR RIGHT LEG INTO A NICE DEEP LUNGE FROM HERE IF WE WANT TO CHOOSE A KNEELING OPTIONS WE'LL DROP TO THE KNEE AND UNCURL THE TOE
USUALLY WHEN YOU GET DONE YOU WILL HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA IF IT'S RIGHT BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET READY TO LOCK IT IT WON'T LOCK
THIS IS THE ONE THAT YOU SEE RIGHT HERE THAT I WILL BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO USE TODAY
NOW THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF STILTS OUT THERE ALL RIGHT
NOW THE CHILD ONES ARE A LOT SMALLER THAN THIS ONE RIGHT HERE
BUT IF IT'S A BRIDGE LIKE THIS THERE'S JUST A HOLE RIGHT HERE FOR YOU TO FEED THE STRING
PUT IT ON AT THE RIGHT TIME
SO RIGHT LEFT RIGHT AND CROWN ONE TWO THREE AND FOUR ONE TWO THREE AND FOUR
SO THAT INSTEAD OF PICKING WITH THE RIGHT HAND ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE JUST GRIPPING THE STRING WITH YOUR FRETTED FINGER AND PULLING IT BACK ALLOWING THAT STRING TO RING OUT
AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO GO ONE TWO THREE AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DO A CROWN SO WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT HIP HOP OUT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT AND CROWN RIGHT LEFT RIGHT CROWN
SO ONCE WE GET THIS BUILT OUR WATER STAYS RIGHT WHERE WE WANT IT TO RIGHT HERE
INSIDE THE TURNOUT BLANKET NEXT TO THE HORSE'S SKIN WE HAVE A LINING THAT IS RIGHT NEXT TO THE HORSE'S SKIN
I THINK SOME OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES YOU FACE IN THIS BUSINESS UNLESS YOU GET A GREAT JOB RIGHT OFF THE BAT IS JUST HAVING PATIENCE
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT BLADE ON AND START CUTTING
IF THE BALL GOES OFF THE RIGHT RIDE YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACK THE RIGHT SIDE
SO WE'RE HERE ON FOUR WE STEP FIVE GO STRAIGHT UP GO OVER YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER SIX FROM THERE WE'RE GOING TO STEP WITH OUR RIGHT FOOT RIGHT CROSS IN FRONT RIGHT
SO MAKE SURE YOU BEND THEM AND SNAP THEM STRAIGHT UP TO THE SKY AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING OUR RIGHT FOOT IN AND JUMP TOGETHER ALL RIGHT
WE'VE GOT AND THIS IS ON FOUR WE STEP LEFT FIVE WE'RE GOING TO THROW OUR ARMS STRAIGHT UP LIKE SNAP ALL RIGHT
AND YOU LOOK TOWARDS THE RIGHT AS WELL AS YOU THROW YOUR HANDS DOWN ON EIGHT
THEN MY LEFT FOOT STEP STRAIGHT MY RIGHT FOOT COMES UP ONE TWO
MAKE SURE YOUR FEET ARE EVENLY SPACED AND YOUR BODY IS CENTERED RIGHT OVER YOUR FEET
WHY IS HOME SCHOOLING RIGHT FOR ME
IT BREAKS RIGHT OFF
WE'RE GOING TO JUST TAKE THE PUT THE HOOP IN THE MIDDLE WITH THE NEEDLE-NOSE PLIERS AND IT WILL BEND RIGHT WHERE WE STARTED TO CUT
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WITH MY FEET AND THAT'S THE FULL FULL BREAST STROKE KICK RIGHT THERE
OK WE CAN GET OUR TANK SET UP AND THEN FREQUENTLY WHAT HAPPENS IS SEEM TO BE DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU WAKE UP AND YOU HAVE CLOUDY WATER
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I PLAY WITH CRYSTAL STICKS INSTEAD OF DEVIL STICKS IS THAT I CAN EXECUTE THAT RIGHT THERE
YOU'LL EITHER BLITZ UP THE MIDDLE OR YOU'LL BLITZ FROM THE RIGHT OR YOU'LL BLITZ FROM THE LEFT
SO JUST POUR THAT RIGHT IN HERE SIZZLING POT SO YOU ADD YOUR SHRIMP STOCK IN YOUR BUBBLING POT
YOU CAN SEE HOW THE BOAT ACCELERATES RIGHT AT THE VERY END
THE PROBLEM WITH THESE GUYS IS THAT THEY HAVE A VERY DELICATE MEMBRANE RIGHT AROUND THEIR SKIN UNDERNEATH THEIR ARMS AND IF YOU TRY TO PUT A LEASH ON THEM YOU CAN CUT INTO THAT TISSUE
SO THIS ONE WE'LL GO FROM A RIGHT HANDSHAKE LIKE THIS
RIGHT ABOUT WHEN YOU ARE ABOUT THIS DISTANCE YOU RELEASE THE BALL SO THE BALL GOES
WHEN YOU DO THE TOSS YOU SHIFT THE WEIGHT FROM YOUR RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR BODY TO YOUR LEFT SIDE OF YOUR BODY AND YOU JUST BRING YOUR ARM UP
THAT'S ALL RIGHT
SO I SLIDE UP BASE MY BODY KEEP MY BODY LEVEL HERE KEEP MY HANDS UP THROW THE RIGHT LEG LEAD SIDE KICK STEP FORWARD SHIFT REVERSE PUNCH TURN THE FOOT OUT
AS I LAND MY WEIGHT STILL COMES HERE I SHIFT FORWARD IN TO THE PUNCH AND THEN AS I PLANT THE ARM BACK I THROW THE RIGHT LEG OUT
LAY ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR POLE YOUR RIGHT LEG COMES UP
IT'S BEEN ABOUT FIVE OR SIX MINUTES SINCE THEY'VE BEEN BOILING AND I JUST SIMPLY PUT SOME COLD WATER IN THEM COLD WATER RIGHT FROM THE FAUCET
I WANT YOU TO PRACTICE WITH BOTH HANDS MEANING YOU START WITH YOUR RIGHT HANDS AND THEN DO IT WITH YOUR LEFT FIRST
NEXT IS AT THE STOMACH RIGHT AROUND HERE THE SOLAR PLEXUS AND IT'S YELLOW
ONCE AGAIN I'M TRYING NOT TO BUILD UP TOO MUCH MATERIAL RIGHT HERE NEAR THE TAIL
AN OCTAVE WOULD MEAN IF YOU WOULD TAKE THIS WAVE LENGTH RIGHT HERE AND YOU DOUBLE THE FREQUENCY
AND OF COURSE EVERYTHING I'VE SHOWED YOU SO FAR LIKE THE SCREENPLAY STAGE PLAY THE AUDIO-VIDEO SCRIPT AND THE AUDIO PLAY SCRIPT ARE VERY SPECIFIC FORMATTING IN THIS DROP DOWN MENU RIGHT
AND YOU SEE ITS RIGHT HERE UNDER THE SELECT ITEM OPTION AND I'VE ALREADY GOT ONE OPEN FROM THEIR OWN EXAMPLE
IN THIS EXAMPLE THEY'RE USING IT AS A STORY OUTLINE AND YOU CAN SEE THEY'VE ALSO EVEN GOT THE NOVEL JUST RIGHT IN THERE
WELL WE ARE ON TO OUR NEXT STEP IN MAKING WIENER SCHNITZEL AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE GOING TO BE GOING OVER THE INGREDIENTS THAT WE USE TO COMPLETE OUR DISH
STRAFE LEFT STRAFE RIGHT
L TRIGGER AIMS AND THE RIGHT STICK MOVES US AROUND
INHALE WITH THE RIGHT ARM AND EXHALE SIDE STRETCHING TO THE LEFT
STAYS ON THE RIGHT SIDE
YOU'RE GOING TO WE'LL LEAVE OUT EIGHT FOR A SECOND ALL RIGHT SO LET'S ADD OUR LEGS
ALL RIGHT AND WHATEVER ARM IS BENT THAT'S THE ONE YOU WANT TO LEAN TOWARDS OKAY
SO KEEP DOING THIS MOTION WITH ME LEFT WITH THE RIGHT ARM STRAIGHT LEFT STRAIGHT RIGHT STRAIGHT
SO YOU'RE GOING TO GO RIGHT YOUR LEFT ARM IS STRAIGHT WHILE YOUR RIGHT ARM'S BENDING YOU'RE GOING TO SWITCH IT LEAN TO THE LEFT LEAN TO THE RIGHT LEAN TO THE LEFT
WE'VE GOT I'M GOING TO START WITH YOUR ARMS FIRST YOU'RE GOING TO USE YOUR RIGHT ARM TO PULL IN A ROPE
WE'RE NOW ON THE GETTING LOW WITH IT PART ALL RIGHT
ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD
SEE THAT LOOKS ABOUT RIGHT TO ME
IN THE RIGHT HAND SIDE WE HAVE THE LEVER THAT CONTROLS THE DOSING CHAMBER AND THE SWITCH TO TURN IT ON
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO FIRST I'M GOING TO PLANT MY FEET IN THE GROUND AND THEN I'M GOING TO REACH MY SHOULDERS DOWN I'M GOING TO REACH OUT WITH MY HAND I'M GOING TO REACH DOWN WITH MY RIGHT HAND AND OUT
IT'S FINE WE'VE GOT A SURPLUS IN THE WAREHOUSE RIGHT NOW
GRAB A HOLD OF THE HEEL TUCK MY TOES STAND RIGHT UP AND WIGGLE IT OUT
BUT THIS LAST SECTION THIS LAST RECTANGLE RIGHT HERE IS THIS IS WHAT IS CALLED YOUR MASTER BUS
SO EVERY ACTIVITY THAT I DO HERE FROM PANNING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT AS YOU CAN SEE THAT RIGHT THERE THE PANNING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
YOUR WANT TO TRY AND KEEP IT RIGHT ON RHYTHM
SO I'M GIVE A LITTLE BLACK CIRCLES INSIDE THE BLUE CIRCLES DRAW ON SOME EYEBROWS AND SOME EYELASHES AND A COUPLE LITTLE MARKS ON THE BEAK THERE AND THAT CREATES THE FACE OF THE DUCK RIGHT THERE
FIRE BABY GOT IT RIGHT HERE IN THE CAN
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW THE ARMS ARE RIGHT NOW
SO WE STARTED RIGHT HERE BOTTOM STRING ZERO TWO FOUR ZERO TWO FOUR ONE TWO THEN IF YOU KEEP GOING UP THE SCALE YOU GOT FOUR ONE TWO FOUR
SO FLIP IT RIGHT SIDE UP TO THE SMOOTH SIDE AND THEN GET AN AREA MOIST THAT'S GOING TO BE IN FAR ENOUGH TO BE AS SMALL AS THIS SQUARE IS HERE
IT'S CALLED THE FROG KICK BUT SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU'LL BRING YOUR HEEL STRAIGHT UP TO YOUR BUTT RIGHT AND YOUR LEG IS STRAIGHT DOWN
OR IS HE GIVING HER THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF ATTENTION
JUST TO SUMMARIZE REMEMBER THAT FEVER IS AN EARLY WARNING SIGN IN YOUR BODY THAT TELLS YOU THAT SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT AND THAT YOU SHOULD REALLY TAKE NOTICE OF IT
THE LABELS WILL TRY TO TURN YOU INTO SOMETHING THEY THINK YOU SHOULD BE AND IT WILL NEVER EVER SERVE YOU RIGHT
PERHAPS YOU WORK FOR A SMALLER BUSINESS OR PERHAPS YOU WORK FOR AN EMPLOYER WHO DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUCH INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE RIGHT NOW
SO THAT'S WHERE IT IS RIGHT THERE
THEY'RE NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT BUT THEY KNOW ENOUGH THAT IF THEY LOSE THEIR MENTAL FOCUS THEY CAN RUIN THEIR WHOLE ROUND RIGHT THERE
RIGHT HERE AS MY DAD HAS ALREADY SHOWN YOU ALL THE INGREDIENTS
I LIKE TO DO THIS ONE ALSO RIGHT BEFORE I GO ON STAGE JUST TO LIFT YOUR ENERGY BACK UP AFTER YOU MIGHT HAVE COOLED OFF
OKAY IN THIS SAMBO COMBINATION WE'RE GOING TO DO A SCISSOR TAKEDOWN INTO SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF ANKLE LOCKS AND THESE ANKLE LOCK COMBINATIONS ARE FOR THE ATTACKER IN THE INSTANCE THAT ONE SUBMISSION DOESN'T WORK YOU CAN FLOW RIGHT TO THE NEXT AND IF THAT ONE DOESN'T WORK YOU CAN FLOW RIGHT TO THE NEXT
ALL RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO START MAKING OUR MARINADE
NOW YOU CAN PICK THE LEAVES OFF ONE BY ONE OR YOU CAN GRAB ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE WAY UP AND JUST PULL AND ALL THE LEAVES WILL COME RIGHT OFF
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE HITTING IN THE MIDDLE MAKE SURE THAT THE GRAIN IS SUPPORTED IN THE RIGHT WAY
WE'RE GOING TO SCRAP IT RIGHT INTO THE CONTAINER AND PUT THE LID ON TIGHT
PEROXIDE AND A LITTLE DISH SOAP WILL GET IT RIGHT OUT
AS YOU'LL SEE I HAVE A TRADE ALERT UP ON MY UP ON THE SCREEN RIGHT NOW
IN THIS CLIP WE ARE GOING TO DRILL OUR PILOT HOLE IN THE CENTER OF THE BOWL WHICH IS GOING TO GIVE US THE DEPTH THAT WE WANT TO GO TO SO THAT WE DON'T CUT RIGHT THROUGH THE BOTTOM
NOW WHAT EVER IS AN EMERGENCY TO A CUSTOMER YOU MAY RECOGNIZE RIGHT AWAY SOMETHING THAT IS VERY EASY TO DEAL WITH
YOU'VE CALLED YOUR PRODUCER OR SESSION LEADER YOU'VE GOTTEN TOGETHER AND PICKED OUT THE KEYS THAT ARE RIGHT FOR YOU YOU'RE GOING TO COME TO THE STUDIO GENERALLY SESSIONS START AT TEN IN THE MORNING OR TWO IN THE AFTERNOON AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME IN THE MUSICIANS WILL ALL LOAD IN GET SET UP
AND WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING YOUR VOCAL RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER
SO YOU JUST WANT TO TURN YOUR BAG BACK RIGHT SIDE OUT
SO IN THIS CASE RIGHT HERE WITH THIS BLUEBERRY PEACH WINE IT'S CLEAR IT'S NOT BUBBLING ANYMORE SO IT'S READY TO TAKE AND BOTTLE
IT'S ALWAYS AMAZING TO ME HOW WE CAN DO SOMETHING RIGHT TIME AFTER TIME AND YET WE ALWAYS GO BACK TO THAT ONE TIME THAT MAYBE WE SCREWED UP
I ACTUALLY HIT A SANDBAR THE OTHER DAY AND SNAPPED IT RIGHT OFF
BUT THIS BOARD RIGHT HERE ABSOLUTELY FLIES UPWIND
USUALLY AFTER EATING GUESTS TEND TO GET A LITTLE TIRED OR WILL LIKE THEIR FOOD TO DIGEST SO YOU WANT TO PLAY AN EASY GAME RIGHT AFTER EATING
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU SET THE RIGHT PACE AND PLAN TO HAVE GAMES AT THE RIGHT TIME
SO YOU PUT YOUR FOOT ON THE FLOOR WE ARE GOING TO SPIN AROUND THE RIGHT FOOT AND SO THE IDEA IS TO PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR FOOT AND THEN MOVE YOUR WEIGHT MOVE YOUR BODY WEIGHT YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY OVER THAT FOOT AND PUSH OFF WITH THE BACK FOOT
YOU CAN DO ALL OF THESE THINGS RIGHT HERE WITH YOUR HANDS
AGAIN THIS TECHNIQUE CAN BE PERFORMED ON EITHER SIDE SO THIS IS WITH THE RIGHT FOOT SO ONE TWO THREE IN TOWARDS THE FACE ONE MORE ONE TWO THREE JUST LIKE THAT
NOW WITH THIS TECHNIQUE YOU USE THE LEAD HAND TO BLOCK YOU ARE GOING TO BLOCK WITH THE LEFT HAND LIKE THIS SPIN THE WAIST OVER TO THE LEFT DROP THE RIGHT LEG DOWN AND FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE HOOK KICK
THE WAY THIS TECHNIQUE WORKS WITH AN OPPONENT IS I PUNCH WITH THE LEFT AND BLOCK WITH THE LEFT HAND SHOOT THE RIGHT LEG IN KIND OF LIKE YOU WERE GOING TO KICK THE LOWER LEG EXCEPT YOU ARE GOING TO PASS BY BRING THE RIGHT LEG AROUND AND HIT WITH THE HEEL OR THE BALL OF THE FOOT
HERE'S MY BUDDY MIKEY RIGHT HERE
IS ALSO ON MOST DJ MIXERS GOT A BASIC CROSS-FADER WHICH FADES BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE LEFT SOUND SOURCE AND THE RIGHT SOUND SOURCE
WHICH THIS SIDE WOULD BE EVEN ON THIS SIDE IT IS A THIRD AND THAT IS PRETTY CLOSE RIGHT THERE
AND HE'S GOING TO SLIP THE MOMENT HE DROPS HIS HIPS IN RIGHT THERE THAT'S WHERE HE HAS GOOD STABILITY
SO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS JUST SWITCHED THROUGH AND WE STEPPED WITH OUR RIGHT FOOT FORWARD ON EIGHT OKAY
SO GO AHEAD AND START AND DO A COUPLE OF BACK STITCHES TO CREATE THE KNOT AND THEN JUST GO RIGHT ALONG THE SEAM WE WANT IT TO BE NICE AND CLEAN AND CATCH BOTH ENDS
SO MY SEAM LINE IS GOING TO BE RIGHT ALONG THE EDGE HERE
I'M GOING TO SEW IT RIGHT ALONG THE UNDERNEATH THE EDGE OF THE WAISTBAND HERE
I'M GOING TO SEW RIGHT HERE
THE RIGHT HAND IS GOING TO BE ON THE SADDLE THIS HAND IS GOING TO HELP YOU TO PUSH YOURSELF UP AND OVER

ONE OF THE NEXT THINGS THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT EASY STEP TO MISS IS FILLING UP THE WATER TANK WHICH ON THIS MACHINE IS UNDER THIS UNDER THIS PLATE RIGHT HERE IN THE BACK OF THE MACHINE
YOU CAN MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS FLOWING RIGHT OUT OF THE STEAM WAND BY JUST KIND OF PURGING THAT INTO A TOWEL
I MEAN RIGHT HAND ENGLISH I'M SORRY
SO HERE WE HAD IT COME OFF THIS WAY WITH NO ENGLISH THIS WAY WITH RIGHT HAND ENGLISH AND THIS WAY WITH LEFT HAND ENGLISH
SO I FLIP THIS AND THEN SIT DOWN RIGHT HERE
SO I DON'T HAVE TO HANDLE IT I'M JUST GOING TO PRESS THE RECORD BUTTON AND JUST LEAVE IT IN THE RIGHT FRAMING AND LET THEM TALK
IN THIS CASE WE'VE GOT FOURTEEN TWENTY WHICH IS JUST RIGHT FOR THIS PARTICULAR GLAZE
AND THEN YOU JUST DROP THIS RIGHT IN THERE GENTLY AND LET IT FALL UNTIL IT STOPS FALLING
AND THEN MAKING SURE THAT THE BUTTERFLY IS FLAT AND THE BODY IS FLAT AND IT HOPEFULLY COMES RIGHT TO THE EDGE OF THE CONSTRUCTION PAPER WE'RE GOING TO BRING THE STAPLER IN AGAIN AND GO IN AT AN ANGLE AND ATTACH IT THERE
WHAT WE'LL DO NOW IS BRING IT IN AND WE WANT TO CATCH IT RIGHT HERE BETWEEN THE HEAD AND THE BODY WITH A STAPLE
AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO HERE IS START AN A EXCEPT A RIGHT HERE WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS A SIXTH FRET ON THE A G AND THE FIFTH FRET ON THE A AND PLAY B OPEN RIGHT THAT AND I'M GOING TO GO THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO PLAY AND BROKEN DOWN WHAT I'M DOING IS SIX FIVE ON THE G AND THE HIGH E WITH THE OPEN B
RIGHT THERE IS WHERE WE WANT THEM TO MEET AS OPPOSED TO WAY OVER HERE
ALL RIGHT NOW THIS IS THE MOMENT YOU'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR

AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE COPYRIGHT INFORMATION AND THE WIZARDS OF THE COAST INC YOU WILL FIND A COUPLE MORE NUMBERS
THE FIRST NUMBER THAT YOU COME ACROSS FROM RIGHT TO LEFT IS THE CARD STAPLE NUMBER
SO I'M JUST GOING TO PRESS THIS RIGHT IN AND YOU CAN SEE HOW PRETTY THAT IS
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO GO AHEAD AND CLOSE YOUR EYES IS I'M GOING TO USE THAT COLOR RIGHT ON HER LID AND I'M JUST GOING TO PRESS IT RIGHT IN AND I'M NOT SWIPING THE BRUSH BECAUSE ESPECIALLY WITH MORE OF A PIGMENTED COLOR IF YOU SWIPE IT YOU'RE SOMETIMES GOING TO GET THAT FALL DOWN DOWN HERE AND WE REALLY WANT TO AVOID THAT BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY WORKED ON HER EYE MAKEUP OR ON HER SKIN EXCUSE ME
SO BLEND IT RIGHT INTO THE SKIN AND THEN IF YOU NEED TO GO BACK AND GET THE SAME BRUSH THAT YOU USED FOR YOUR CREASE COLOR YOU CAN DO THAT SO IT BLENDS EVERYTHING IN TOGETHER AND YOU CAN SEE HOW PRETTY THAT IS
OK I WANT YOU TO BEND A LITTLE BIT DON'T MAKE A CREASE RIGHT HERE BUT BEND A LITTLE BIT SO I CAN GET THE ELBOW THE BACK OF THE UPPER ARMS OK AND I'M GOING TO DO THIS ONE BEND A LITTLE BIT
I'VE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE FULCRUM HOW THE FULCRUM WORKS MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT NUMBER FOR WHEN YOU WANT TO DIVE OFF THE BOARD
I'M GOING TO CRADLE MY RIGHT ELBOW THROUGH MY BODY AND I'M GOING TO PULL THIS ARM BACK TOWARD MY SHOULDER
SO FROM THIS POSITION WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO USE THE WEDGE OF MY HAND AND I'M GOING TO HIT IT RIGHT INTO MELISSA'S WRIST BONE OKAY
RIGHT ON THE BEND OF IT
SO WHEN WE LAY IT ALL DOWN YOU CAN AGAIN SEE THAT I'M REALLY ON THE TIPS OF MY FINGERS NOT LETTING THEM TOUCH ANY OF THE STRINGS RIGHT NEXT TO THEM
TELL THEM THAT THE SEAM OR THE COVER ALWAYS GOES TO THE LEFT AND YOU CAN TEACH THEM THEIR LEFT AND RIGHT HANDS AT THE SAME TIME SO THAT THEY DON'T TAKE THE BOOK AND START IT FROM THE BACK WHICH IS VERY NATURAL AND THEY WOULD EVEN PUT IT UPSIDE DOWN IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FACT THAT THE PICTURE WOULD BE UPSIDE DOWN
WE ARE KEEPING THE LOOPS IN FORMATION BY PINCHING MY OTHER HAND NOW AND I AM GOING TO TAKE THIS TAB END OR THE SHORT END AND WE WILL GO FROM THE OUTSIDE IN AND WE ARE GOING TO RUN THAT THING THROUGH THE LOOP AND KIND OF GET THAT LOOP THE SAME SIZE AS THE OTHER LOOPS AND JUST KIND OF PULL EVERYTHING RIGHT ON DOWN JUST LIKE THAT
ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AS WELL THERE WILL BE A BEAD ANY PART OF THE STICK RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE BALL IS GOING TO BE INSIDE AGAINST THE MILK CARTOON SO YOU REALLY WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING THE STICK DIRTY WHILE YOU'RE PAINTING IT
FOLD ONE OF THE SECTIONS TO THE RIGHT SO WE STILL HAVE FOUR SECTIONS ON BOTH SIDES
I'M GOING TO GO RIGHT INTO THE FOOT SWEEP FROM HERE
IF TRACEY GRABS ME IN A FRONT CHOKE RIGHT HERE SHE EXPOSES HERSELF
IN THIS CASE IT'S GOING TO BE RIGHT THERE SO I'M GOING TO TAKE MY PIN TOOL AND SIMPLY MARK IT
BUT THOSE ARE GOING TO BE THREE THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN PURCHASING A TURNOUT BLANKET SO THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE GETTING THE MOST BLANKET FOR YOUR BUCK AND IF YOU HAVE PURCHASED SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE RIGHT FOR YOUR ELEMENTS AND YOUR CLIMATE AND YOUR HORSE
OK AND NOW I'M GOING TO GO IN WITH A NICE LITTLE PINK ON THE APPLES OF THE CHEEKS SMILE ALEX AND JUST START WITH THE APPLES WHICH IS RIGHT HERE AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO PULL YOUR BRUSH BACK RIGHT ALONG THE CHEEKBONE AND JUST BLEND IT IN AND THEN I'M GOING TO DO A LITTLE LIGHT HIGHLIGHT RIGHT ON THE TOP AND I'M JUST GOING TO SWEEP MY BRUSH BACK AND FORTH A COUPLE OF TIMES ON THE TOP OF THE CHEEKBONE
NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO IN AND CONTOUR HER FACE A LITTLE BIT AND ADD A LITTLE BLUSH TO HER CHEEKS SO I'M GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BRONZE COLOR AND A BLUSH BRUSH AND I'M GOING TO LIGHTLY SWEEP IT JUST RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE CHEEKBONE AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A LINE
THAT'S RIGHT THIRTY SECONDS AND THEN THEY START TO THINK ABOUT THEIR MOST FAVORITE SUBJECT AND THAT IS THEMSELVES
AND JUST SORT OF SORT OF GET THEM UNDERNEATH THERE AND THEN SHE SHOULD JUST POP RIGHT OUT
THESE ARE THE SHOES RIGHT DOWN HERE AND WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS SORT OF PUSH THEM DOWN AND MOVE YOUR FINGER ACROSS
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THE CONDITIONER IS RINSED OUT REALLY WELL BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T RINSE THE CONDITIONER OUT WELL ENOUGH THEN THE COLOR HAS NOTHING TO APPLY TO IT WILL JUST SLIDE RIGHT OFF
I'M RIGHT HANDED SO I'M GOING TO PLACE MY HAND BEHIND THE BALL AS SUCH INTO THE GROOVE
EXTENDING HER TAILBONE RIGHT DOWN INTO THE EARTH AND THEN LENGTHENING UP TO THE CROWN OF THE HEAD INHALING IN AND THEN AS SHE EXHALES SHE ROTATES INTO THAT LENGTH JUST A LITTLE BIT DEEPER
ALRIGHT SO THIS MACHINE DOES HEAT UP THE WATER TO RIGHT ABOUT 200 DEGREES AND IT IS STABILIZING RIGHT THERE SO THAT IS GOOD AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE I WANT IT
AFTER I TURN IT ON THE WATER WILL START COMING OUT AND I WILL STICK IT IN THIS HOLE RIGHT HERE AND WHATEVER TEMPERATURE IT STARTS TO STABILIZE AT IS WHERE THE WATER IN THE MACHINE IS GOING TO BE AND I WANT THAT AT ABOUT 200 DEGREES
THE WAY THAT I WILL TEST THAT RIGHT NOW IS BY TURNING ON THE GROUP HEAD AND LET WATER FLOW THROUGH HERE I WILL TAKE MY THERMOMETER
IT LOOKS LIKE I SET MY SEAT RIGHT JUST BY GUESSING THERE CAUSE I LIKE TO RIDE A 73.25 MILLIMETERS SEAT HEIGHT AND THAT IS WHAT WE GOT
THE BEST WAY TO MEASURE SEAT HEIGHT IS THE TAPE MEASURE MEASURING IT CONSISTENTLY FROM THE CENTER OF THE BOTTOM BRACKET WHICH IS THAT BOLT RIGHT THERE TO THE CENTER OF THE SEAT TUBE
SO I MEAN YOU COULD LEAVE WHOLE LIKE THIS I WISH I COULD CUT IN HALF SO WHAT YOU WANT TO IS FIND THE SPOT RIGHT HERE RIGHT RIGHT BY THE RIB CAGE
YOU MAY WANT TO USE YOU KNOW A SUPER SHARP KNIFE IF YOU GOT A CLEVER THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO DO THAT SO YOU HACK INTO RIGHT THERE
JUST REALLY PULL THIS PART UP AND WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO YOU ARE TRYING TO BREAK THE BACK BONE RIGHT BACK HERE SO LET'S MARK THIS SIDE AND YOU WANT TO TO SNAP OUT THEN YOU ARE GONNA GET YOUR HAND DIRTY
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU LEAVE OPEN JUST ENOUGH OF AN OPENING SO THAT YOU CAN TURN YOUR PLACE MAT RIGHT SIDE OUT
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FABRIC IS OBVIOUSLY THE FRONT
YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THE RIGHT SIDES OF BOTH FABRICS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE TOGETHER LIKE THAT
SO WHAT THAT DOES IS THE RACKET JUST PUSHES THE BALL RIGHT ABOVE THE TIN
SO YOU HAVE THE RACKET SO THEY'VE HIT THIS GREAT SHOT AND YOU'RE VIRTUALLY AT A DEAD RUN AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME IN AND YOU PUT THE RACKET OUT AND YOU GET RIGHT UNDERNEATH IT
NOW WHAT I'M ACTUALLY DOING IS I'M SPINNING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE STICK GETTING AN OUTSIDE SPIN ON THE TASSEL KICKING MY LEG OVER AND LETTING THE STICK JUST ROLL OVER MY LEG LIKE THAT AND BACK OUT TO MY RIGHT CONTROL STICK JUST LIKE THAT
NOW TO WORK ON THIS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET THIS CATCH DOWN AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE USED TO KICKING YOUR LEG UP AND CATCHING THE UNDERSIDE OF THE CRYSTAL STICK OR SORRY THE TOP SIDE OF THE CRYSTAL STICK ON THE UNDERSIDE OF YOUR LEG AT THE RIGHT BALANCE POINT SO THAT JUST SPINS OVER NICE AND EASY LIKE THAT
RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT DOING SPIN TRICKS WITH THE TASSEL SPIN
THAT'S THE RIGHT FOOT
AGAIN YOU WANT TO KEEP IT RIGHT UNDERNEATH YOURSELF YOU'RE JUST USING THE ANKLE OR BELOW THE KNEE OKAY NOT THE WHOLE LEG
SO KIND OF CREATE SORT OF A RUFFLED LOOK BY GOING LIKE THIS RIGHT ALONG THE EDGES LIKE THAT
BUT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE RULES AND HOW IT IS PLAYED OUT PLAYED BY THE RULES SO YOU KNOW HOW TO GET IT RIGHT
UNLIKE THIS ONE WHICH GOT REALLY THIN RIGHT HERE
YOUR ADULT MOUSE WOULD BE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE
BENDING YOUR FRONT KNEE AND THEN LIFTING YOURSELF RIGHT BACK UP
THAT'S WHY WE ALWAYS KEEP A TOWEL RIGHT HERE SO WE CAN JUST WIPE OFF OUR FINGERS REALLY QUICK
IT GOT A DRIPPING PAN RIGHT BELOW IT GOT THIS IS GOING TO HOLD THE PIG AND I WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO PUT THAT TOGETHER TO AND IT CREATES A HEAT DOWNWARD RATHER THEN YOU EXPECT THE HEAT TO GO UP
I'M NOT TOURING RIGHT NOW SO THESE ARE THE BUSINESS CARDS AREA
SO THE THROW PRECEDING I'LL MAKE OUT OF MY RIGHT HAND THAT'S THE THROW PRECEDING IT AND THE CATCH
KEEP IT LOW AND REALLY BE CONSCIOUS OF THE BALL TRAVELING PAST YOUR EAR AND DROPPING RIGHT BEHIND YOUR SHOULDER AND IF YOU HAVE TO KICK YOUR SHOULDER OUT A LITTLE BIT FORWARD TO GET YOUR ARM BACK THERE THAT'S OK
AND LAY RIGHT DOWN
POINTING LIKE SOMEBODY'S GOT YOU RIGHT BY THE TOES AND YOU'RE REACHING
I'M GOING TO STEP INTO I'M GOING TO LINE UP AT MY TARGET AND THEN I'M GOING TO AIM TO THE RIGHT A LITTLE BIT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HOOK
BECAUSE THE BALL'S ABOVE MY FEET IF I DON'T ACCOUNT FOR THE CONTOUR OF THE SLOPE HERE I CAN SWING RIGHT INTO IT
SO YOU WANT TO LINE UP YOU WANT TO GET A NICE STANCE AIM A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF YOUR TARGET AND THEN TAKE A NICE EASY SWING
TAKE A TRASH BAG PUT IT RIGHT IN THE BOTTOM OF YOUR PACK YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT OKAY
NOW IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY STRETCHES THEIR ARM LIKE SO YOU WANT TO GET THE PULL RIGHT HERE AND SWITCH WITH THE OTHER ARM
AND TAKE YOUR LEFT HAND DOWN TO THAT RIGHT ANKLE
IN A SINGLE STRAIGHT LEG STRETCH TAKE YOUR RIGHT HAND ON THE BACK OF THE RIGHT LEG FOR THE HAMSTRING
SO IT'S RIGHT LEFT WITH HER FEET
IT'S JUST BELOW THE POINT WE JUST DID AND IT'S GOING TO BE AGAIN IN A MUSCLE BELLY JUST BELOW THE KNEE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE BONE
I KNOW THERE ARE SIX CYLINDERS AND RIGHT NOW I'M ON MY THIRD CYLINDER
WHEN YOU'RE BACKING UP YOU'RE TRYING TO CENTER THE BACK WHEELS OF YOUR TIRE RIGHT THERE IN THE GROOVE AND AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT YOU WORRY ABOUT THE FRONT TIRES
AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN GO HERE THE FIRST WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO IS TO THE RIGHT AND THERE'S ANOTHER SECURITY CHECK POINT HERE AND A COOL A ART DECO STYLE LAMP THERE
AT THE SAME TIME YOU WANT TO STEP OUT WITH YOUR RIGHT LEG
THE SOUNDER IS ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT NOW SO WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW DEEP IT IS
TELL THE BIG LIE OFTEN ENOUGH AND THEY'LL BELIEVE IT RIGHT
MY RIGHT HAND COMES OVER MY HEAD THIS WAY
YOU CAN ACTUALLY JUST COME UP WITH A SHEET OF FOAM CORE USE YOUR A-CLAMP CLAMP IT TO A LIGHT STAND AND YOU STILL HAVE YOUR UP AND DOWN CONTROLS JUST BY TIGHTENING AND LOOSENING THE COLLAR ON THE BACK SIDE AND YOU CAN MOVE THAT RIGHT IN BETWEEN THE LIGHT AND YOUR CAMERA
IF YOU USE DIFFERENT SIZES YOU CAN HAVE THEM ALL LINED UP AND IN A CUP SOMEWHERE RIGHT WHERE YOU CAN REACH THEM
NOW THE REST OF THE MERCHANDISE ACCOUTERMENTS ARE HERE RIGHT BESIDE ME
YOU SEE MY WONDERFUL CORDS AND THINGS RIGHT HERE THIS IS TO CONNECT TO A PHONE LINE
AND SO NOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NOW THAT I'VE HOOKED THESE WIRES UP I'M GOING TO TRY ALLIGATOR CLIPPING THESE WIRES FROM THOSE POINTS FROM THE BEND POINT RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT HERE
I'M NOT GOING TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW
NOW THIS IS CALLED THE SADDLE RIGHT IN HERE
AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS IN THE RIGHT SPOT
ONCE WE'RE HERE WE WANT TO HAVE THE RIGHT LENGTH OF STRING
WE TURN OUR BODY SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT AND BRING OUR RIGHT HAND FORWARD AND WE THROW THE LEFT LEAD HOOK ONE THEN WE COME FORWARD LEFT HAND COMES TO MY FACE AND MY RIGHT HAND THROWS THE UPPER CUT TWO NOW FROM HERE MY LOAD UP I AM GOING TO TWIST BACK THIS WAY AND MY WEIGHT GOES TO MY RIGHT FOOT AND MY RIGHT SHOULDER PULLS MY LEFT HAND FORWARD AND I STEP IN LEAD HOOK REAR UPPER CUT
I'M GOING TO TAKE THE BALL AND I'M GOING TO PUT IT RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE
TAKE IT FROM WHAT I'M TEACHING YOU RIGHT HERE RIGHT HERE THROW IN SOME WAVES YOU KNOW
ALRIGHT THAT'S THE BASICS OF POPPING RIGHT THERE
AND THAT CAN BE VERY FULFILLING BECAUSE RIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE YOU CAN GO INTO A LAB AND WORK AND WE TRAIN YOU ON THE JOB
ALL RIGHT THE DRINK WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE IS APPLE GRANDE
A LITTLE T IS RIGHT HERE
I WAS LEADING WITH THE RIGHT
ROTATE THE HOOP FROM THE RIGHT HAND TO THE LEFT OR FIRST TO SECOND HAND
RIGHT THERE THERE THERE
YOU'RE GOING TO DROP IT DOWN RIGHT BEHIND YOUR LEFT HIP THAT'S WHERE IT'S GOING TO CONNECT FIRST
NOW WHEN YOU FEEL THAT HOOP CONNECT WITH YOUR PALM RIGHT THERE THERE THERE THERE YOU'RE GOING TO START TO BEND YOUR ELBOW BRINGING THE HOOP DOWN TO THE TORSO
AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
OKAY WHAT I'M DOING IS I'M JUST DRY BRUSHING THIS RED ON HERE AND I JUST WANT TO ADD A LITTLE BIT JUST TO GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE DIMENSION BECAUSE THE END RESULT IS WHERE THIS IS GOING TO SHOW UP NOT SO MUCH RIGHT NOW
OR LIKE SOMEBODY'S PULLING THE FRONT OF YOUR PANTS YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR ZIPPER SEE IF EVERYTHING IS OKAY THERE SO THAT'S THE MOVE RIGHT HERE
SO INSTEAD OF HAVING PAUL BACK HERE WITH ME SOMETIMES WHAT WE MIGHT DO IS WE'LL READJUST THIS SEAT AND PUT IT RIGHT BEHIND BRELYND AND INSTEAD OF FACING FORWARD PAUL WOULD THEN BE FACING ME
LET'S COME DOWN HERE AND LET'S CHOOSE THIS ONE RIGHT HERE
WE ARE GOING TO ADD THIS TO IT AND IT IS GOING TO MELT RIGHT INTO THE STOCK
SO WE ARE GOING TO GRAB IT AND RIGHT INTO OUR PAN
SO IF YOU PEEL THAT OFF YOU CAN STICK IT RIGHT TO THE FLOOR
AND YOU OPEN IT UP RIGHT HERE AND YOU CAN PUT IT ANYWHERE
NOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF ROOM IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO SLIP THE PADS OFF THAT RIGHT THERE IS PLENTY AS YOU CAN SEE I GOT THE CALIPER TO MOVE A LITTLE BIT
I USUALLY STEP FORWARD WITH MY RIGHT FOOT MEANING THAT I WOULD RIDE GOOFY
WHICH IS WITH YOUR LEFT FOOT IN THE BACK RIGHT FOOT IN THE FRONT
BUT SOME PEOPLE MAY RIDE REGULAR WHICH IS RIGHT FOOT IN THE BACK LEFT FOOT IN THE FRONT
IF I DO ONE SIDE AND I LET IT SET I CAN KNOCK OFF THE BUMPS ON THE OTHER SIDE AND I DON'T GET THAT GROOVE THAT YOU WILL GET IF YOU PUT A COAT ON THIS SIDE RIGHT NOW
SO GO AHEAD AND PIN YOUR FABRIC AROUND AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOUR SEWING MACHINE AND SET IT UP AND WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND STITCH ALL THE WAY AROUND RIGHT SIDES TOGETHER
THERE'S A LOT MORE FONTS INCREASING THE FONT SIZE RIGHT HERE FONT COLOR AND SIMILAR TO THE JUST REGULAR STUFF UNDO AND REDO CUT SAY COPY AND PASTE
AND I'M RIGHT HANDED WE'LL PUT IT ON TOP OF THE INSTRUMENT AND JUST KIND OF PUSH DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT AND THAT SHOULD MAKE YOUR KEY CLOSE
IN THIS CLIP WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS HOME SCHOOLING RIGHT FOR ME
IS IT RIGHT FOR ME
SO WHAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO PULL THE TRIGGER ON THE SHOT
AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN DO ALL OF THE FUNDAMENTAL THINGS RIGHT YOU CAN COME OFF THE SCREEN YOU CAN BE OPEN FOR A SECOND YOU CAN CATCH THE BALL YOU CAN GET IT READY IN THE SHOOTERS POCKET YOU CAN BE READY TO DELIVER THE SHOT BUT YOU HAVE A GOOD DEFENDER ON YOU THAT'S GOING TO COME OUT AND PLAY DEFENSE ON YOU AND THAT MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT TIME TO TAKE THE SHOT
THE SHOES SHOULD BE IN A NEUTRAL COLORS SIMILAR TO THE SANDALS THAT I'M WEARING RIGHT NOW
WHILE FLIP-FLOPS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE A STAPLE OF THE PREPPY WARDROBE THEY TEND TO BE NICE FLIP-FLOPS OR NICE VERSIONS OF FLATS LIKE THESE SANDALS THAT I'M SHOWING YOU RIGHT HERE
NOW ON ONE OF THESE ON THE RIGHT IT IS DRAWN A LOT WITH THE WAX DIRECTLY IN BLOCK FORM ON THE PAPER ITSELF
SO ALWAYS RIGHT THERE
SO ALWAYS CHECK AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE HOLDING THE RIGHT POSITION
STEP IT RIGHT BACK
THAT RIGHT HEAL IS POINTING OUT
THE RIGHT TOES ARE POINTING IN AT ABOUT A FORTY-FIVE DEGREE ANGLE
AND WE'LL DEFINITELY TALK ABOUT THOSE RIGHT NOW
WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING WITH IT IS YOU'RE THROWING THE YOYO DOWN WHICH SEEMS REALLY WEIRD CAUSE YOU'RE LIKE WELL IT'S JUST GOING TO COME RIGHT OFF THE STRING
AND IT WILL LAY ON THE FEATHER BOA LIKE THIS RIGHT ON TOP OF ONE OF OUR PIPE CLEANER HOLDERS
NOW DON'T JUMP RIGHT TO TRIPLE BLENDS MASTER DOUBLE BLENDS FOR A FEW DAYS OR WEEKS WHATEVER YOU THINK UNTIL YOU THINK THEY'RE READY AND THEY'RE JUST TIRED OF BLENDS
THESE GENERALLY COME WITH LITTLE WASHERS AND YOU CAN JUST THROW THAT RIGHT ON THE BACK
WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE FIRST STRING ON WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE BALL END OF THE STRING WE'RE GOING TO PUT THAT RIGHT IN THIS SLOT ON THE TAIL PIECE
SHAKE IT RIGHT OFF
NOW YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO FEEL RIGHT TO THE INNER THIGH OF THAT RIGHT LEG
WHAT YOU WANT TO FEEL THAT LEFT ARM EXTENDING UP HIGH ANOTHER DEEP BREATH IN AND EXHALE NOW RELEASE COME ALL THE WAY UP AND YOUR ARMS COME RIGHT DOWN
YOU'RE GOING TO STEP FORWARD ON YOUR RIGHT FOOT TOWARDS THE AUDIENCE AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO SWITCH YOUR HANDS SO YOU'RE RIGHT HAND IS GOING TO GO ON YOUR HIP WHILE YOUR LEFT HAND GOES TO YOUR CHEST
I SEE IT BREAKING FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
IT WAS RIGHT HERE SO IT'S IN THE MIDDLE
TURN TO THE RIGHT
OH AND USUALLY IT'S SEWN A LOT RIGHT HERE RIGHT AROUND THIS SEAM BUT YOU JUST BREAK THOSE THREADS
IN THIS SITUATION RIGHT HERE THERESA IS GRABBING ME STRAIGHT ACROSS
JUST RIGHT OVER THERE
YOU HAVE THAT RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'LL BE PAYING AT THE TABLE YOU DON'T WANT ANY ANY MYSTERIES OR ANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO GET A BALLPARK FIGURE HE CAN'T GIVE AN EXACT FIGURE BUT HE CAN SURE GIVE YOU A BALLPARK FIGURE AN ESTIMATED SELLER PROCEED VERY IMPORTANT
AND SO ONE REP IS A CRUNCH SIDE BEND RIGHT CRUNCH SIDE BEND LEFT THAT'S ONE REP
SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE HERE IS WE START OUT BY PUTTING THE LITTER BOX ON THE GROUND RIGHT NEXT TO THE TOILET
AND RIGHT NOW THE FACTORY DEFAULT IS EIGHTY PERCENT
AND THE THERMOSTAT SITS RIGHT BACK HERE UP BESIDE THIS HOUSING
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SPECIFIC AREAS WHERE YOU CAN USE CHOPPING ON A HORSE AND AGAIN WHEN I SAY CHOPPING I AM TALKING ABOUT HOLDING YOUR HAND LIKE THIS USING THE SIDE OF YOUR HAND OK YOU CAN USE IT RIGHT IN BACK OF RIGHT IN THE WITHERS AREA NOT ALONG THE SPINE IN THE AREA THAT'S RIGHT HERE NEXT TO THE SPINE AND IN BACK OF THE SHOULDER BLADE
SO FOR OUR SEASONINGS WE'RE GOING TO USE A LITTLE BLACK PEPPER SOME GARLIC POWDER SOME CREO SEASONINGS ONION POWDER SOME GARLIC SALT THESE ITEMS RIGHT HERE WE'LL BASICALLY USE WITH THE CHICKEN ALONG WITH SOME FLOUR TO DREDGE THEM IN AS WELL AS A CUP OF OIL TO FRY THEM IN
YOU CAN PUT THE DECK RIGHT ON THE TABLE TELL THEM OKAY JUST CUT THE DECK AND WE'LL USE THE CARD THAT YOU CUT TO AS OUR SELECTED CARD
RIGHT HERE I HAVE ONE EXAMPLE OF A HOME ESPRESSO GRINDER AND HOW IT WORKS IS YOU HAVE YOUR HOPPER HERE WHERE YOU THROW YOUR BEANS INTO
ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE DOSING CHAMBER I HAVE A LEVER TO PULL THE COFFEE OUT OF THE DOSING CHAMBER
AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OVER HERE AS WELL I HAVE A SWITCH TO TURN ON THE ESPRESSO GRINDER
WE COULD HAVE IS COME RIGHT OUT THE BACK BUT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE MORE DRAMATIC IF WE HAVE IT COME RIGHT OFF THE TOP
WE'VE GOT TO FIND THE RIGHT PLACE TO STICK IT IN
NOW DROPPING THE KNEE EXTEND THE LEG BEND THE KNEE OPEN UP THE HIP BY DROPPING IT OVER TO THE RIGHT BEAUTIFUL
BENDING THAT KNEE DROPPING IT OVER TO THE SIDE OVER TO THE RIGHT OPEN UP THAT HIP PERFECT
ONE MORE TIME BEND THE KNEE PERFECT OPEN UP THAT HIP BY DROPPING IT OVER TO THE RIGHT LOVELY DROP THAT KNEE EXTEND THROUGH THE LEG AND THEN LOWER THE KNEE DOWN TO THE GROUND AND PRESS INTO CHILD'S POSE
SO AGAIN YOU STEP PIVOT AS YOU PIVOT THE WEIGHT IS GOING TO COME TO THE RIGHT AND THEN YOU USE YOUR CHA-CHA-CHA TO COMPLETE THE TURN
CHA-CHA-CHA BACK STEP CHA-CHA-CHA THAT'S THE FULL RIGHT TURN
WE ARE GOING TO ADD THIS LATER ON BUT RIGHT NOW WE ARE GOING TO TAKE OUR EGGS AND ADD ALL OF OUR CHOPPED CELERY DILLED PICKLES AND ALSO SCALLION INTO THAT EGG MIX
RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE LOOKING AFTER YOU THROW THE BALL
THE 63 CADILLAC IS ESPECIALLY NOTORIOUS FOR LEAKS ON THAT FITTING RIGHT THERE IN THE CENTER WHERE IT PLUGS INTO THE ENGINE
SO YOU HAVE HIM STEPPING FORWARD RIGHT THERE AND THE SECOND PHASE HIS RIGHT LEG IS GOING TO COME AROUND TO HELP HIM RECOVER FOR THE NEXT SHOT
SO SOMETHING TO CONSIDER WHEN YOUR THINKING ABOUT COLLECTION IF YOUR TRYING TO DEFINE WHERE YOU WANT TO COLLECT I CAN TELL YOU JUST FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE JUST SEEING NOW TRANSFER WARE BROWN TRANSFER WARE IS VERY COLLECTIBLE RIGHT NOW AND ITS COMMANDING VERY HIGH PRICES
ONE OF THE THINGS I JUST WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHEN WERE JUST TALKING IN GENERAL ABOUT COLLECTING AND WERE TALKING RIGHT NOW SPECIFICALLY ABOUT COLLECTING RUBY FLASH
GET ENOUGH IN THERE MORE THAN YOU NEED AND THEN FINISH IT BY WIPING IT RIGHT OFF
SO THE ONLY OTHER AREA WE ARE GOING TO SPACKLE FOR NOW IS JUST GOING TO BE THIS AREA IN THE PLASTER RIGHT HERE THAT IS REALLY DETERIORATED A LOT FROM THE WATER DAMAGE
SO WE ARE GOING TO GO RIGHT AHEAD AND TAKE A GOOD AMOUNT OF THAT ON THE KNIFE AND JUST SMEAR IT RIGHT OVER THAT PROBLEM AREA
TRUST ME IT'S A LOT OF REPS OK THEN RIGHT AWAY I'M BACK ON THE TRAIL BACK INTO THAT TWO MINUTES OF RUNNING
NOTICE I'M ADDING A BICEP CURL AND I'M MAKING SURE THAT MY KNEE STAYS RIGHT OVER THAT HEEL
NOW WE'LL PICK UP THE PACE AND SEE IF OUR RIDER CAN ALSO THEN PUT THAT COORDINATED EFFORT HER SHORT REIN RIGHT HAND ON THE REIN LEFT HAND READY TO SNAG THAT FLAG AND BRING IT ON HOME WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SPEED
OUR RIDER IN TRAINING HAS STILL HER SNAFFLE IN HER SPLIT REINS AS WE WOULD GO TO COMPETITION WE'D PROBABLY PUT A MORE PERFORMANCE BIT AND OUR BARREL REINS ON TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN HOLD OUR REINS SNUGLY WITH A SHORT REIN WITH ONE HAND ON THE REINS HER RIGHT HAND SINCE SHE'S USING THE LEFT HAND FOR THE FLAG RETRIEVAL
NOTHING IS THAT IMPORTANT THAT IT CAN'T BE DONE TAKE TIME TO BE DONE THE RIGHT WAY AND BE DONE SAFELY
ITS NOT ADMISSABLE IN COURT SO DON'T GO HOME AND TEST YOUR KIDS AND BEAT THEM IF IT DOESN'T TURN OUT RIGHT
AFTER YOU'VE OLLIED OVER THE BEGINNING OF THE LEDGE YOU WANT TO GO OVER THE TOP LAND ON TOP OF THE LEDGE PUTTING ALL THE PRESSURE RIGHT HERE AND HANGING YOUR NOSE JUST OVER THE TIP OF THE LEDGE ITSELF
AND IF THERE ARE POINT AREAS THAT PARTICULARLY FEEL TENDER THAT'S USUALLY A GOOD SIGN YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT LOCATION
I DON'T LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE COME UP LIKE THIS AND TRY TO KARATE CHOP HIM RIGHT ON THE COLLARBONE
YOU'LL NOTICE ALSO HOW I'M GETTING OFF THE LINE OF THIS ATTACK RIGHT HERE
THEY MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE MAINTAINING A PROPER DIET MAINTAINING PROPER STRETCHING AND CALISTHENIC REGIMENS MAKING SURE THEY'RE DOING THEIR WORKOUTS WHEN THEY'RE NOT ON THE FIELD MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE HITTING THE GYM RIGHT DOING THE RIGHT TYPES OF EXERCISES AT THE RIGHT TIMES
AS YOU CAN SEE WITH JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SANDING I HAVE SANDED RIGHT THROUGH MY VENEER AND SHOWN THAT UGLY PLYWOOD UNDERNEATH
IF YOU HAVE KITE OR A PUMP RIGHT HERE SOMETIMES IT'LL COME WITH A PRESSURE GAUGE
YOUR OBJECT BALL STARTS RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF THE TABLE
BUT THE BACK STAYS IN THE FLOOR AND CONTROL IT INHALING AND EXHALING INHALING AND EXHALING RELEASE JUST LAY RIGHT DOWN
YOU LAY DOWN ON A SOFT MAT OR A CARPET AND BRING THAT RIGHT KNEE IN TOWARDS YOU AND PUT YOUR LEFT HAND RIGHT AROUND THAT RIGHT FOOT AND THEN LOOK UP TOWARDS YOUR FOOT AND BRING THAT LEFT KNEE IN NOW TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN AND SWITCH WHERE BOTH LEGS ARE TUCKED RIGHT IN TOWARDS YOU WITH THE LEFT KNEE AND THEN YOU ARE GOING TO EXHALE SWITCH AND YOU ARE GOING TO INHALE AND EXHALE SWITCH AND INHALE LENGTHEN OUT SO THE TOES GO OUT LONG AND EXHALE
IT WILL COME RIGHT OUT
NOW I'LL HOLD DOWN MY ALT KEY AND GRAB IT AND COPY IT RIGHT ON OVER
TECHNIQUE IS HOW YOU ARE ACTUALLY USING YOUR HANDS YOUR BODY AND YOUR WRIST AND ALL OF THAT RIGHT
THIS SHOULD JUST FALL RIGHT OFF WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT IT TO DO
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE SONG TO THIS TEMPO AND THESE ARE QUARTER NOTES RIGHT HERE
JOEL SIEGEL ALL RIGHT
SO I'LL PUT THE HIGH HAT THE RIGHT HAND HIGH HAT BACK IN ON THIS NEXT CLIP AND WE'LL GO THROUGH THIS DOWNBEAT HIGH HAT LIFT ON ONE AND TWO
SO IF YOU PRETEND THE PIANO IS RIGHT HERE AND SAY YOU HAVE THE ACCOMPANIST RIGHT HERE ALONG WITH THE PAGE-TURNER
SO REALLY POSITIONING YOURSELF RIGHT AFTER YOU'VE TUNED FINDING A GOOD SPOT MAYBE RIGHT HERE SO THAT THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF AN ANGLE
AGAIN JUST PRACTICE SIMPLY BY HAVING YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR KNEES RESTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR HIPS AND PRESSING BACK LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO SIT IN THE CHAIR MAKING SURE YOU'RE AWARE KNEE BEHIND THE TOE AND IN LINE WITH THE ANKLE
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND A POINT WHERE YOU STOP AND THAT'S ACTIVE RANGE OF MOTION BOOM RIGHT THERE
HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS BECOMING THE BEST DEFENSIVE PLAYER YOU CAN INCLUDES BECOMING A GOOD FUNDAMENTAL DEFENSIVE PLAYER AND A GOOD DEFENSIVE TEAMMATE AS WELL
AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE RIGHT NOW IS A SITUATION WHERE THIS GUY IS GUARDING THE MAN ON THE WING
THIS GUY RIGHT NOW HAS THE BALL SO HE HAS TO COMMIT TO HIM AND HE HAS TO GUARD HIM FULLY BUT AS QUICKLY AS THE BALL MOVES FROM THERE GO AHEAD AND MOVE IT TO THE TOP OF THE KEY
RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE BAD STUFF
SO WE START WITH OUR LEFT HAND DOWN OUR RIGHT KNEE UP AND WE ARE BASICALLY GOING TO HAVE OUR NICE LITTLE STUTTER STEP NOW AS WE PIVOT OUR LEFT FOOT
YOU WANT TO GO FROM THE TOP RIGHT FROM THE TOP AND IF YOU JUST GIVE A NICE LITTLE TUG ON THEM LIKE THAT EVEN THE WEIGHT OF THE THING ITSELF SHOULD BE ABLE TO PULL THEM OUT LIKE THAT YOU KNOW RIGHT FROM THE TOP JUST LIKE THAT COME OUT REALLY EASY
NOT FROM THE OUTSIDE RIGHT HERE CAUSE THIS IS WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE MOST GREEN
ALL RIGHT WE JUST COVERED IKKYO NOW WE'LL DO NIKKYO
HERE TOUCH THE HANDS THE WRIST GOES DOWN RIGHT INTO THE PIN
SO IN THIS CASE WHAT I'M AFTER IS A P THAT I WANT TO PUT RIGHT HERE SO THAT I END UP WITH PLACING AND SPACING
AND THE WHOLE IDEA OF TRACING HAS TO DO WITH FIGURING OUT WHERE THINGS ARE GOING TO GO DECIDING HOW TO PUT THEM THERE PUTTING THEM IN THE RIGHT PLACE
RIGHT WHERE THAT GRIP IS
SO AFTER I CUT IT I MADE SURE I LEFT LITTLE TABS AROUND THE PATTERN SO THAT WHEN I PUT THE IRON ON HERE I COULD THEN JUST SNAP IT RIGHT ON TO THE IRON
THE DIASTOLIC PRESSURE IS THE PRESSURE WITHIN THAT ARTERIAL SYSTEM JUST AFTER THE HEART RELAXES SO WE HAVE CONSTANT CONTRACTION RIGHT HERE IN THIS VENTRICLE SHOOTS BLOOD UP THROUGH THE AORTA AND THEN IT RELAXES
RISSA IS GOING TO COME ALONG SIDE HER YEAH AND TAKE HER KNEES EQUAL TO GINA'S KNEES HER HANDS AGAIN ARE ALSO GOING TO BE RIGHT UNDERNEATH HER SHOULDERS
SO WE'LL START WITH THE FEET SAME KIND OF MOVEMENTS LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT
AGAIN IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME BASIC FOOT MOVEMENT IN TERMS OF THE RHYTHM THAT YOUR FEET ARE MOVING IN BUT IT'S GOING TO BE TO THE RIGHT THIS TIME AND WE'RE GOING TO BE PICKING UP OUR RIGHT FOOT AS SOON AS WE PUT IT DOWN ALMOST
THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON A ALTERNATE TURN TO THE RIGHT
RIGHT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT
AFTER THAT RIGHT FOOT PICKS UP OR IT CAN SWIVEL
PULLS EM RIGHT OUT
I'VE GOT A TWO GIG MEMORY CARD IN IT RIGHT NOW
RIGHT OVER HERE IS WHERE YOU CAN ATTACH POWER FROM THE WALL OR FROM A CIGARETTE LIGHTER AND RIGHT HERE IS WHERE YOU CONNECT AND A CABLE THAT WILL CONNECT THROUGH A USB CONNECTION TO YOUR COMPUTER
THIS IS THE CAMERA STRAP AND IT ATTACHES SECURELY ON EITHER SIDE AND UNDERNEATH IS YOU SLIDE THIS TO THE RIGHT OPEN THIS UP AND HERE'S WHERE YOUR RECHARGEABLE BATTERY IT'S A PROPRIETARY BATTERY IT'S A LITHIUM ION RECHARGEABLE YOU CAN'T USE DOUBLE A'S IN THIS BATTERY AND HERE'S WHAT YOU PUT THE MEMORY CARD IT USES AN SD MEMORY CARD
AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT THAT LINING RIGHT INSIDE
ONE THING ALSO ABOUT ADVANTAGE IS THAT WHEN THE REFEREE GIVES IT HE CAN ALSO STILL HAND OUT A CARD FOR THE FOUL SO EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY HAVE BLATANTLY TAKEN SOMEONE OUT AND THEY STILL MAINTAINED POSSESSION IF THEY DON'T CALL IT RIGHT AWAY THE REFEREE CAN STILL AWARD THE CARD TOO
WE HAVE SAYINGS THAT EVEN THE RIGHT BIT IN THE WRONG HANDS CAN BE A PROBLEM TO THE HORSE
AND FROM EXTENDED CHILD'S POSE WE WANT TO COME UP AND BRING THAT RIGHT FOOT BACK BETWEEN THE HANDS A LITTLE HARDER WHEN YOU'RE KNEELING BUT THAT'S OKAY
I'M GOING TO BRING THE RIGHT LEG FORWARD OUTSIDE THE RIGHT ARM
SO RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO PUT A NASTY CUT IN THE PANEL
I CAN ALSO DO THINGS AS FAR AS MUTING THE LEFT SOLING THE LEFT MUTING THE RIGHT THERE'S A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS RIGHT HERE AS WELL AS THE DIMMING ENDS AND MUTE ALL AND A MONO
I CAN TURN TO A 51 A 5.1 SURROUND SOUND AS WELL AS A LEFT CENTER RIGHT AND SUB TYPE MIX YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING FOR FOUR SPEAKERS
I CAN DROP THE TUBING DOWN IF I WANTED TO RIGHT
SO WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN BY TURNING YOUR RIGHT LEG OVER
IT SHOULD SLIDE RIGHT OUT
THE FIRST THING WE DID SINCE WE HAVE A BONE IN ANY KIND OF MEAT WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE THAT BONE RIGHT OUT
SO MAKE SURE THAT YOU EAT A NORMAL MEAL SOMETHING THAT'S NOT TOO FULL AND NOT RIGHT BEFORE YOU WALK IN
IF YOU PUT THAT IN THE REFRIGERATOR IT'S A LITTLE BIT WARM HERE RIGHT NOW
IF YOU PUT THAT IN THE REFRIGERATOR IT WILL SET RIGHT UP AND THAT IS OUR GHOSTY CUPCAKE
IT'S JUST WATER COLOR ON PAPER RIGHT
SHIFTING WEIGHT SIDE TO SIDE RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT
WHAT I DO IS I TAKE IT I SPIN IT AROUND TO WHERE MY ARMS ARE CROSSED BUT THEN I LAY IT UP AGAINST MY BODY TO THE SIDE AND THAT'S ACTUALLY A STRIKE IN OF ITSELF BUT THEN YOU CAN TURN THAT INTO A SPIN BY TAKING IT UNCROSSING YOUR ARMS CHANGING YOUR HANDS POSITIONS SO NOW YOUR RIGHT HAND IS PALM DOWN LEFT HAND PALM UP
ANOTHER WAY ADDING IN STRIKES INTO SPINNING YOUR BO STAFF IS TO TAKE HAVE THE LEFT HAND PALM DOWN THE RIGHT HAND PALM UP
YOU TAKE YOUR HANDS SAME POSITION RIGHT HAND PALM UP LEFT HAND PALM DOWN
YOU JUST HAVE TO LEARN TO CHANGE YOUR HANDS AT THE RIGHT TIME AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE STAYING IN THE CENTER OF THE BO STAFF SO THOSE ARE JUST TWO OR THREE BASIC WAYS TO BE ABLE TO SPIN YOUR BO STAFF AROUND AND GET STARTED
THAT'S THE MAIN THING RIGHT NOW
ALL RIGHT NOW AS WE PUSH BACK IN YOU KNOW WITHIN OUR BACKGROUND YOU CAN SEE HOW IT BUILDS UP
ALL RIGHT THAT'S GOING TO FILL IN ALL THE DETAILS AND NOW HIT ME WITH THE KEY NICE
FROM THAT LENGTH ON YOUR EXHALATION TWIST TOWARD THE RIGHT
I KNOW THE BRAZIL LOOK IT'S GOT A WAY HIGHER SHEEN IT'S MADE RIGHT NOW AND OF COURSE IT SAYS MADE IN BRAZIL WHAT A GREAT TIP-OFF
ACTUALLY THE TELESCOPE THAT YOU NEED TO USE THE TELESCOPES ARE RIGHT HERE YOUR EYES
SO YOU KIND OF LEAVE YOUR FINGER TO THE SIDE LEAVE YOUR FINGERS HERE CAUSE IF YOUR FINGER IS EVER ON THE TRIGGER YOU ALWAYS HAVE THAT POSSIBILITY THAT THE SAFETY MIGHT NOT BE ON OR EVEN IF IT IS ON IT MIGHT NOT BE WORKING RIGHT AND YOU COULD SHOOT SOMEBODY
JUST PUT A SMALL PIECE OF SCOTCH TAPE DOWN IN THE POSITION AND YOU TAKE IT TO THE MACHINE JUST LINE IT UP RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE FOOT
JUST RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE BROW
WHAT THAT WILL DO IS IT WILL ENGAGE THE BRAKES TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE RIGHT THERE AND READY FOR YOU WHEN YOU NEED TO USE THEM
SO WHEN YOU DROP IN GO OVER ACROSS THE SPINE THEN COME DOWN PLACE YOUR TIRE JUST RIGHT WHEN YOUR READY TO JUMP AND GIVE IT A TRY
JUST REMEMBER JUST TAKE YOUR TIRE RIGHT BETWEEN THE TWO COPINGS THAT WAY YOU DON'T SLIP OUT
TO BE ABLE TO HIT YOUR TIRE BETWEEN THE TWO COPINGS OF THE SPINE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS PLACE YOUR TIRE RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN THE TWO COPINGS THAT WAY YOU GET LOCKED IN
SO I'M GOING TO USE THIS BRIGHT YELLOW RIGHT HERE
BECAUSE TO DO THIS RIGHT TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND A LOT OF SLOW EFFORT
AT THE SAME TIME I'M GOING TO STEP FORWARD IF YOU'RE THE PARTNER ON THE RIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO STEP FORWARD WITH LEFT FOOT ONE TO WALK CLOSER TO EACH OTHER
AND SCRUB YOU KNOW IT'S PUT MORE ELBOW GREASE INTO IT RIGHT ISN'T THAT WHAT OUR MOM ALWAYS TAUGHT US
NOW YOU DON'T WANT THE HOLE TO BE TOO BIG SO YOU NEED TO FIND THE RIGHT DRILL PIECE
WE PUT IT DOWN INTO PLACE AND IT'S GOT A LOT OF FRICTION ON IT RIGHT THERE BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE IT TIGHT
WHEN THEY'RE DEMONSTRATING THE RIGHT WAY HOW TO DO AN EXERCISE THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY MAKE IT CLEAR WITH THEIR CLIENT THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING BEFORE THE CLIENT GOES OUT THERE AND PERFORMS THE EXERCISE
THEN RIGHT HERE ON YOUR LEFT HAND SIDE IT SHOWS SCREEN RESOLUTION
TO GET MORE ADVANCED OPTIONS RIGHT HERE BELOW THE COLOR QUALITY THERE IS A BUTTON THAT SAYS ADVANCED GO AHEAD AND CLICK ON ADVANCED
AND THEN WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO SKIP OVER THIS ONE SO I'M GOING TO CHAIN ONE AND THEN I'M GOING TO GO RIGHT INTO THIS NEXT HOLE
NOW YOU SEE THESE TWO ARE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER BUT AGAIN IT'S JUST TO KEEP OUR OUTSIDES LINED UP
START RIGHT HERE
BUT RIGHT NOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS TALK ABOUT HOW TO USE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS TO MAKE THAT HENNA DESIGN EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL AND COLORFUL AND MATCH YOUR CLOTHING OR GOWN OR WHATEVER YOU LIKE TO EMBELLISH IT WITH

THE SQUARE KNOT RIGHT HERE WOULD HAVE BEEN USED INITIALLY SAY IF YOU HAD A BATH ROBE AND SAY IF YOU JUST HAD YOUR LINES COMING AROUND YOUR WAIST THEN YOU WOULD JUST TIE YOUR SQUARE KNOT
BUT IF YOU'RE DOING THIS RIGHT HERE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO END UP DOING IS YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WEAVING THIS INTO A LINE
AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS LINE RIGHT HERE WAS WEAVED STARTING WITH OUR SQUARE KNOT
ALL RIGHT IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO DO THE FIFTY FIFTY FRONTSIDE BOARDSLIDE
THIS ONE HAPPENS TO BE LOCATED ON THE RIGHT SIDE RIGHT DOWN HERE
THE RADIATOR IS GOING TO HAVE A DRAIN COCK ON EITHER THE RIGHT OR LEFT LOWER CORNER
IF YOUR SIDE HAS BID SIXTY RIGHT AND YOU HAVE THIRTY-FIVE MELD YOU NEED TWENTY-FIVE COUNTERS TO MAKE THAT BID
AND JUST GO RIGHT IN AND ROLL THE Q-TIP
SO AGAIN I'M UP ON THE EDGE AND I NORMALLY HAVE A SEAMSTRESS FOR THIS SO GRACE FRAGA YES WHICH IS MOM RIGHT
WHEN THAT DOG YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL HE'S BITING DOWN ON YOU AND YOU HAVE TO CLICK YOUR R-STICK DOWN JUST AT THE RIGHT MOMENT
WELL THE MAIN POINT IN ALL OF YOUR SQUASH IS TO GET BACK TO THE TEE AREA RIGHT HERE SO WHEN I SERVE IF I SERVE AN OVER HEAD SERVE I WANT TO WATCH THE BALL AND I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE TEE
WATCH WHAT MY FEET DO AND I MOVE RIGHT OVER SO BEFORE THE BALL IS EVEN TO MY OPPONENT I AM BACK AT THE TEE
WHAT YOU'LL WANT TO DO IS JUST TEST WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU AT THE SPEED THAT YOU'RE ROLLING
OKAY IF I'M HERE AND A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER AND I PUSH MORE WITH THE BOTTOM OF MY FOOT I'M GOING TO WORK THIS TEARDROP MUSCLE MORE RIGHT IN HERE RIGHT IN HERE WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT AREA TO WORK IT PROTECTS YOUR KNEE
SO IF THIS IS OUR D FLAT RIGHT HERE RIGHT
I CAN DO THAT WITH THE STRAP BUT I CAN ALSO DO THAT RIGHT HERE JUST TAKING THE HIP AND CREATING LENGTH
SHE'S GOING TO TRY TO KEEP THIS LEG ACTIVE BUT SHE'S GOING TO USE THIS STRAP TO ASSIST HER AND SHE'S GOING TO USE AN INHALE TO ALERT THE BODY AND THEN ON THE EXHALE SHE'S GOING TO BRING THAT LEG OVER TO THE RIGHT
THE OTHER THING I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS OUR DIFFERENT STYLES OF BARBEQUE
IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO PICK OUT EXACTLY THE ONE THAT WAS RIGHT FOR ME SO I WANT HIM TO LIVE QUITE AWHILE
HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS HOW TO BECOME THE BEST FUNDAMENTAL SHOOTER THAT YOU POSSIBLY CAN OFF THE MOVE
SOMETIMES THE BRIDE-TO-BE WILL HAVE A SASH THAT GOES RIGHT ACROSS WHERE IT SAYS I'M THE BRIDE-TO-BEAND THOSE ARE NICE TO WEAR WITH OUTFITS
SOMETIMES DEFENDERS ARE GOING TO CLOSE RIGHT OUT ON YOU AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A HAND ON THE BALL AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET A SHOT AWAY
MIDDLE TO THE RIGHT
AGAIN YOU'RE TRYING TO PULL EVERYTHING TOGETHER IT'S NOT HOW FAR WE COME OVER BECAUSE THEN I'M WORKING WITH MY BACK MORE THAN I AM FOCUSING RIGHT HERE
TRY WORKING UP TO ABOUT TEN REPS WITH RIGHT FOOT OVER LEFT AND THEN STRETCH IN BETWEEN IF YOU NEED TO AND CROSS LEFT OVER RIGHT AND CURL CRUNCH BREATHE INHALE DOWN
THIS IS MY WAY AND I USE THE CAN TOMATO SAUCE RIGHT HERE
WITH YOUR WEIGHTS YOUR FREE WEIGHTS HANGING RIGHT DOWN BY YOUR SIDE OR AN OPTION WOULD BE TO PLACE THEM ON THE MIDI PART OF THE SHOULDER RESTING LIGHTLY ON TOP
SOFTEN YOUR BRAIN SOFTEN YOUR EYEBROWS AND JUST IMAGINE THAT YOUR CHEEKS ARE JUST SLIDING RIGHT OFF OF YOUR FACE AND YOU'RE MELTING INTO YOUR MAT
USE YOUR FIVE IN ONE TOOL OR PUTTY KNIFE AND REALLY SEAL THAT UP RIGHT A WAY
AND WE JUST WANT TO BACK TACK RIGHT ON TOP OF THIS
MY STUDIO IS SMALL BUT IT'S A DECENT SIZE TO WHERE I'VE GOT A LOT OF LITTLE PLACES WHERE I CAN PUT THINGS BUT I KNOW WHERE EVERYTHING IS AND WHEN I NEED A PARTICULAR COLOR OR I NEED A PARTICULAR ITEM I CAN GO RIGHT TO IT AND I CAN CONTINUE ON WITH MY PAINTING
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE POUR IT RIGHT IN LIKE THAT
GINA IS GOING TO TAKE A BIG INHALE IN AND THEN AS SHE EXHALES SHE IS GOING TO PRESS HER HANDS RIGHT DOWN INTO THE EARTH AND LIFT WILLIE UP GOOD
WILLIE IS GOING TO COME FORWARD WITH A PLANK POSE WITH HIS WRISTS RIGHT NEXT TO GINA'S HIPS AND THAT HAS TO BE ADJUSTED TO HOW TALL YOU ARE OF COURSE
SO MY LEFT HAND IS GOING TO THROW HALF AS OFTEN AS MY RIGHT HAND IN UNISON
NOW THERE ARE ACTUALLY A LOT OF VARIATIONS ON ONE UP TWO UP I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE RIGHT HERE
I'M JUST GOING TO IMPROVISE WITH MY RIGHT HAND PLAYING IN THE KEY OF F MAJOR
THEN I'M RIGHT BACK IN F MAJOR AGAIN
BUT IN USED IN A PERFORMANCE HORSE THIS IS GOING TO PUT ENOUGH PRESSURE TO THE ROOF OF THEIR MOUTH THAT WITH VERY LITTLE HAND MOVEMENT THIS BIT IS GOING TO PUT THEM RIGHT WHERE I NEED THEM WITHOUT ANY HAND MOVEMENT ON MY PART
AS FAR AS FLIGHT PATHS EVERYTHING IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO THREE BALL JUGGLING EXCEPT YOU HAVE THE ADDED COMPLEXITY OF THE CLUB SPINNING AND YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH THE RIGHT END
AND I ALSO USE TISSUES FOR CLEANING THINGS LIKE THIS PEN RIGHT HERE DIP IT IN WATER OR ALCOHOL AND THEN I'LL USE A TISSUE TO CLEAN IT OFF
SO THAT WHEN YOU POUR THE GROUT AND THEN POP IT OUT THE GLASS IS STILL ON THE SURFACE SO TO SPEAK EVEN THOUGH RIGHT NOW IT'S AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MOLD
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS TAKE AND SLIP RIGHT BACK IN HERE AND INSTALL OUR CAMBER BOLT
ALRIGHT WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND START OUR NUT RIGHT THERE
BUT THIS GUY IS GOING TO STICK RIGHT INTO IT STICKS RIGHT OVER THAT FLOW CONTROL PART THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OK
SO IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A CLEAN SLICK LOOK LIKE WE'RE DOING A SPACESHIP THAT'S OBVIOUSLY MADE OUT OF MEDAL SO WE'RE ALL RIGHT TO SMUDGE THAT IN
SO WE'RE DOING THIS HERE SEE WE'RE GOING TO PUT SOME JETS PUT SOME JETS RIGHT THERE
SO AS YOU CAN SEE AS I'M APPLYING THE PASTEL IT'S A VERY CHALKY KIND OF MEDIUM AND IF YOU CAN CLOSE IN ON THIS WHILE I'M DOING IT YOU CAN SEE THE CHALK JUST COMING RIGHT OFF
GOING BACK AND FORTH JUST GIVING IT A NICE CUT AND THAT'S A NICE ADD ON TO YOUR THING AND JUST AGAIN PUTTING IT RIGHT HERE ON THE SIDE KIDS COULD GRAB WHAT THEY WANT
SO ONCE YOU PUT ALL THAT TOGETHER YOU GOT LIKE THE SICKEST CABBAGE PATCH DANCE EVER SO CHECK OUT THIS COUPLE OF CLIPS RIGHT HERE THIS IS HOW YOU CAN BE ABLE TO MOVE YOU BODY
MAKE SURE YOU TURN YOUR BODY LEFT AND RIGHT MAKE SURE IT BENDS SO IN THESE COUPLE OF CLIPS RIGHT HERE YOU SEE HOW YOUR BODY BENDS LEFT AND RIGHT AND HOW YOU CAN BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITH A LITTLE FUNK A LITTLE TWIST
NOW IF YOU'RE RIGHT HANDED THAT'S GOING TO BE YOUR RIGHT HAND
YOU'RE GOING TO TWIST YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER AND YOU'RE GOING TO TURN YOUR RIGHT FOOT OUT ON THE HEEL AND YOU'RE GOING TO ALLOW THE LEFT TOE TO TURN ON THE BALL OF THE FOOT
YOU'RE GOING TO ALLOW YOUR LEFT KNEE TO SLIDE BEHIND YOUR RIGHT SHIN YOUR HANDS TOUCH THE THIGH YOU'LL SQUAT DOWN HOLD STAND TWIST TO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION YOUR HANDS COME DOWN UP AND FORWARD
SEE HOW HIS RIGHT FOOT PLANTS OUT
NOW THIS LEG HAS TWO OPTIONS IF YOU'RE STARTING TO DO THIS EXERCISE JUST KEEP IT RIGHT HERE
WHAT I LIKE TO DO TO PRACTICES CATCHES FIRST OF ALL TO CATCH WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND AND YOUR LEFT HAND IS TAKE THE FRISBEE AND CATCH IT LIKE THIS WITH YOUR LEFT HAND TOSS IT WITH YOUR LEFT HAND AND CATCH IT WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND
BUT WE WOULD TAKE A MALLET AND WE WANT TO SEPARATE THESE AT THESE TENDON JOINTS RIGHT HERE AND IT'S SIMPLY JUST GOT A ROUND POST THAT IS HOLDING THESE ROCKERS ON
LEFT HAND RIGHT HAND
AND AGAIN IF YOU CHOOSE TO TRY TO DO THESE AND MIX THEM UP FRONT KICK SIDE KICK SORT OF BACK SWING RIGHT HERE YOU CAN DO THAT IF YOU LIKE TO MIX IT UP A LITTLE BIT
AND I'M GOING TO SLIDE THAT HAIR I'M GOING TO SLIDE THAT PROBE RIGHT INTO THE HAIR FOLLICLE
SO THIS IS ONE CUP OF BUTTER I'M JUST GOING TO TOSS THAT RIGHT IN THERE AND IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU BAKE WITH SOFTEN BUTTER
IF YOU CAN SEE RIGHT ALONG HERE I HAVE A RIDGE AND THAT'S THE FATTEST PART OF THIS STONE RIGHT NOW
ALL RIGHT WHICH SHOULD YOU USE
WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO THAT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP IT ON THAT RIGHT NOW
ALL RIGHT THE FIRST THING THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR SHRIMP AND REMOVE OUR SHELLS
I'M GOING TO TAKE THE RUB AND ALL YOU DO IS JUST PUT IT IN YOUR HANDS AND PUT IT SPRINKLE IT RIGHT ON THE MEAT
THE NEXT STEP IN HELPING YOUR PET COPE WITH ARTHRITIS IN HIS SHOULDERS IS TO ACTUALLY MASSAGE BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES RIGHT UP AND DOWN THROUGH THIS AREA
AND A LOT OF TIMES STRINGS END UP BREAKING RIGHT HERE AT THE NUT AS WELL AS AT THE TUNER AND DOWN AT THE BRIDGE
MY LEFT FOOT I MEAN MY RIGHT FOOT I'M GOING TO STEP IT BACK CHECKING THIS MID-LINE RIGHT
NOW THE REASON THIS IS GOOD WITH A STRIPPER DECK IS THAT THERE'LL BE TIMES WHEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO STRIP THE CARD RIGHT OUT AND PUT IT ON TOP OF THE DECK BECAUSE IT'S BEEN REVERSED
JUST PUT IT RIGHT ON TOP OF WHERE YOU SEWED BEFORE BACKSTITCH OF COURSE
AND AS YOU STEP LINDA IS GOING TO STEP RIGHT LEFT AND WITH HER ARMS GO AND TWO
NOW I'M GOING TO STEP THROUGH A RIGHT HAND RIGHT FOOT AS I STEP I HIT THE HAND
TO BEGIN THE COMBINATION I'LL STEP FORWARD TURN MY RIGHT FOOT OUT I'LL STEP FORWARD LEFT FOOT BACK STANCE LEFT HAND PALM BLOCK
NOW IT CIRCLES OVER AND NOW MELISSA THROWS THAT RIGHT PUNCH HITS THE PALM AND PULLS IN
SO WE ARE GOING TO WATCH RIGHT NOW REVERSE ONE AND A HALF TUCK POSITION
JUST A STRAIGHT CUT STRAIGHT ACROSS AND IT WOULD BUTT RIGHT UP TO THE CASING
THAT'S A NICE SHOT RIGHT THERE TOO AND I'LL JUST CONTINUE DOING THIS UNTIL WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW THAT SHE'S GOING TO LIKE
LOOK RIGHT IN THE CAMERA
AND THEN TO FINISH IT OFF YOU'RE GOING TO JUST TAKE SOME BALM RIGHT HERE AND THIS IS [PH] BAGHEAD WHICH IS SO GREAT
ALVIN DEDEAUX ALL RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO TIE THIS CLOUSER MINNOW AND THE TOOLS AND MATERIALS WE NEED FOR IT ARE OBVIOUSLY THE VISE TO HOLD THE HOOK SCISSORS TO CUT OUR MATERIALS PLIERS FOR MASHING THE BARB DOWN ON THE HOOK WHIP FINISHER FOR FINISHING IT OFF
WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO PUSH IT TO THE RIGHT AND YOU'LL NOTICE YOU POP THE YOYO UP AND PUSH IT TO THE RIGHT IN THE SAME MOTION
A COUPLE OF THOSE TRICK SHOTS RIGHT THERE
IN OTHER WORDS IF WE HAD THIS SET UP RIGHT HERE IN OUR GAME OF EIGHT BALL ONCE AGAIN
BUT AGAIN IF I'M GOING TO STOP MY CUE BALL RIGHT THERE THAT'S NOT GOING TO GIVE ME A GOOD SHOT
AND YOU ARE GOING TO EXTEND ONE ARM HERE I'M DOING MY RIGHT ARM AND THE RIBS ARE GOING TO EXPAND AND LIFT THROUGH THE RIGHT SIDE AS IF I HAVE AN APPLE IN A TREE AND I'M REACHING TO PICK IT
ALL RIGHT SO SUNRISE ARMS UP AND LET THEM FLOAT DOWN AND OUTLINE YOUR BODY NICE AND SOFT AND UP KEEP THAT SHIMMY GOING NICE AND POWERFUL
IF YOU WANTED TO DO A NOSE WHEELIE JUST SWITCH IT UP AND PUT ALL OF YOUR WEIGHT OVER YOUR LEFT FOOT AND RAISE YOUR RIGHT FOOT
YOU DON'T WANT TO KEEP YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT TOO MUCH DRY POWDER AROUND THERE BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF POWDER AROUND THERE FROM THE EYE SHADOWS ANYWAY AND THAT'S GOING TO GO RIGHT INTO THE CREASES OF THE EYE OR THE LINES OF THE EYES
SO TURN RIGHT THIS SIDE THANKS
A TAIL WHEELIE ALL OF YOUR WEIGHT WOULD BE FOCUSED ON YOUR RIGHT LEG LIKE SO
SHE IS GOING TO GRAB THOSE HAND STRAPS AND STARTING POSITION IS REACHING THE ARMS RIGHT IN FRONT OF US KEEPING A SOFT BEND AT THE ELBOW JUST AS IF YOU WERE HUGGING A BIG TREE
OR THIS KNOT RIGHT HERE THAT I'M FIXING TO SHOW YOU
SO IF WE LOOK RIGHT HERE ON THE TABLE YOU CAN SEE THAT I'VE GOT MY HOOP THAT I'M GOING TO USING AND HERE'S MY LINE HERE
THEN OF COURSE YOU HAVE YOUR HOME ESPRESSO MACHINE RIGHT HERE WHICH COMES WITH THE PORTER FILTER THE STEAM WAND
YOU GOT YOUR ESPRESSO GRINDER RIGHT HERE AND OF COURSE THE BEANS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO USE FOR THE ESPRESSO FOR THE DRINK
SO WE'RE GOING TO GO RIGHT FOOT LEFT FOOT RIGHT FOOT BRINGING THE LEFT FOOT FORWARD LEFT FOOT RIGHT FOOT LEFT FOOT SLIDE THE FOOT FORWARD AND RIGHT LEFT RIGHT AND SLIDE LEFT RIGHT LEFT AND SLIDE
YOUR RIGHT HAND IS PLAYING EIGHTH NOTES THOUGH OKAY
JOEL SIEGEL ALL RIGHT
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET THAT REALLY FINE HAIRLINE LIKE THIS RIGHT HERE YOU WANT TO BE AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET WITHOUT TOUCHING THE NEEDLE
HOLDING THE BALL RIGHT AT MY CHEST I TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN
SO I CAN RELEASE MY RIGHT FOOT OPPOSING MY RIGHT FOOT WITH MY LEFT HAND SO I CAN MOVE MY LEFT FOOT AND UP I GO
ONCE YOU GOT IT RIGHT IT IS REALLY STABLE YOU MIGHT EVEN GET A NO HANDS REST FOR A WHILE
I'D GET HIM IN AND IMMEDIATELY GET HIM RIGHT BACK OUT
SO HERE I GO RIGHT
AND EXHALE LET THE KNEES GO RIGHT DOWN AWAY FROM YOU SHOULDERS RELEASING KEEPING YOUR MIND ON YOUR HANDS SO THEY'RE NOT GRABBING THE FEET
SO IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THE FEET FIRST LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT JUST BACK AND FORTH VERY SIMPLE AND IF YOU WANT TO COUNT IT OUT AND ONE AND TWO AND THREE AND FOUR AND ONE AND TWO AND THREE AND FOUR
THIS IS JUST A SIMPLE RIGHT TO LEFT MOVE AND ALL YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING IS MOVING YOUR LEGS LEFT AND RIGHT
SO UP AND RIGHT DOWN AND LEFT UP AND RIGHT DOWN AND LEFT
OVER AND OVER AND THEN WE ADD THE ARMS AND WHEN YOU GO TO YOUR RIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO BE RAISING YOUR RIGHT ARM TO YOUR LEFT YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOWERING YOUR LEFT ARM OR YOUR RIGHT ARM SORRY
THIS BIG STACK RIGHT HERE IS YOUR DECK OR YOUR LIBRARY
SO YOU TAKE THE BALL YOU TAKE THE RACKET YOU OPEN THE FACE AND YOU JUST BLOCK IT AGAINST THE WALL AND THAT'S A FOREHAND VOLLEY RIGHT THERE
SO AGAIN YOU'RE WAY ON THE BALLS OF YOUR FEET HANDS TABLETOP TOE RIGHT OUT IN FRONT OF YOU AND WHEN YOU'RE DOING A PENCIL TURN WITH NO NERVE TAPS YOU WANT TO JUST BARELY OFF THE FLOOR OKAY
WE'RE GOING TO PAUSE RIGHT HERE FOR RIGHT NOW AND WE'LL PICK IT UP IN THE NEXT PART
RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO CONCENTRATE ON IS STRENGTH CONDITIONING IN DIVING
BUT I LIKE TO USE A BRUSH BECAUSE IT GIVES A REALLY REALLY POLISHED LOOK SO I'M GOING TO START RIGHT FROM THE MIDDLE OF HER LIP AND YOU CAN SEE THIS IS A REALLY REALLY BRIGHT PINK BUT ONCE AGAIN THIS ACTUALLY BLENDING IN WITH HER CHEEK COLOR
SO HERE IF WE'RE IN THE KEY E MINOR WE'D GO THIS IS 6DIMINISHED AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO JUST DROP THIS DOWN THAT'S V I RIGHT
AND SO MAKE SURE YOU HOLD YOUR NUNCHUCKS NICE AND TIGHT CAUSE AS YOU GO FASTER AND FASTER YOU DON'T WANT IT TO FLY AND HIT SOMEBODY ALL RIGHT
YOU USE A BACK ROCK HERE A CHASSE TO THE LEFT AND A CHASSE TO THE RIGHT
THE FOOT POSITIONS FOR THIS STEP LEFT FOOT BACK RIGHT FOOT IN PLACE LEFT FOOT TO THE SIDE CLOSE RIGHT FOOT TO LEFT FOOT LEFT FOOT TO THE SIDE RIGHT FOOT IN PLACE LEFT FOOT CLOSES TO RIGHT FOOT RIGHT FOOT TO THE SIDE
I TRY TO SAY HEY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THIS OR IF YOU KNOW BUT YOU COULD PLAY WHEELCHAIR BASKETBALL AND THEY LOOK AT ME LIKE BUT IF I CAN GET THEM TO COME OUT AND GET THEM TO TRY AND GET THEM TO WATCH OUR TEAM AND GET THEM TO REALIZE WE TRAVEL AND WE HAVE FUN AND WE'RE SEMI-PROFESSIONAL SOMETIMES IT GETS IN THEIR BLOOD AND THEY'RE HOOKED FOR LIFE BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE RIGHT OUT THERE RIGHT NOW WHO CAN PLAY THIS GAME AND THEY JUST DON'T EVEN KNOW IT OR THINK THEY CAN'T BUT THEY OUGHT TO GIVE IT A SHOT
THEY JUST NEED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN THEIR COMMUNITY BUT THERE MIGHT BE WHEN I'M IN A MALL OR GOING TO A MOVIE I'LL SEE AN AMPUTEE WITH A PROSTHETIC LEG WALKING DOWN THE HALLWAY
AND THE INHALE THIS TIME IS GOING TO EXTEND THE LEFT ARM AND ON THE EXHALE WE'RE GOING TO OPEN TO THE LEFT TWISTING THE SPINE YOU CAN INVITE YOUR RIGHT HAND INTO THE RIGHT FOOT LENGTHENING THE SPINE TWISTING FROM BELOW THE RIGHT SHOULDER BLADE
SO LET'S RIGHT THAT IN THERE DO ANOTHER LITTLE TURRET UP IN HERE
YOU'RE GOING TO ELEVATE THEIR HEAD AND YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE WHICHEVER HAND WE'LL USE THE LEFT FOR RIGHT NOW
SO BASICALLY WE'VE CUT OUR FABRIC AND WE'VE PUT THE RIGHT SIDES TOGETHER
NOW WHERE I READ IT IS GOING TO BE RIGHT HERE AND I CAN SEE THAT THAT WALL THICKNESS IS ABOUT OH A STRONG 1/4
LEFT FINGER GOES DOWN ONE RIGHT FINGER GOES UP TWO
NOW UNDERSTAND THE WE ARE WORKING JUST ESCAPES RIGHT NOW
LET ME TAKE THAT DOWN ABOUT RIGHT THERE JUST EYEBALLING IT
WE'RE GOING TO LOWER THIS LEG RIGHT HERE AND GET MORE OF THE ANGLE THAT I WANT
AND THEN I'M GOING TO FLIP IT LIKE THIS AND THAT LOOKS ABOUT RIGHT
WE'RE GOING TO INHALE LENGTHEN UP AND AS YOU EXHALE TAKE YOUR FRONT ARM DOWN AND REACH OVER WITH THE BACK ARM PRESSING YOUR BACK HIP RIGHT DOWN INTO THE EARTH ROLLING YOUR SHOULDER OVER AND REACHING YOUR ARM FORWARD
IN ORDER TO GET YOUR HAIR STRAIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO CHOOSE A BRUSH THAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU
NOW THAT'S IT'S FILLED UP TAKE OFF THE TOP HERE REMEMBER TO LEVEL OFF THE COFFEE IN THE BASKET AND I'M JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND LEVEL IT OFF AND PUT IT RIGHT BACK INTO THE DOSING CHAMBER AND THEN WE CAN DUMP IT LATER
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I FEED A LITTLE BIT WIDER RIGHT HERE HE'LL STEP IN HIS RIGHT LEG COMES AROUND NOW HE IS AT A STRONG BASE TO RECOVER BACK
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD SHOT RIGHT OFF RIGHT OFF THE TOP
IN THIS CASE IF I FLIPPED OVER AT THIS MOMENT WHICH I'M NOT GOING TO DO RIGHT AWAY
A CUSTOMER HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT COUGHING AND NOT IDLING RIGHT AND RUNNING ROUGH
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS JUST TAKE THE STEAMER AND GO RIGHT DOWN HOW SIMPLE IS THAT
ONCE YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU HAVE A SOFTWARE ON YOUR COMPUTER LIKE 7-ZIP THAT CAN OPEN THE RAR FILES THERE'S AN OPTION TO EXECUTE THE PROGRAM AS PART OF YOUR EXPLORER SHELL SO THAT IN OPENING MY COMPUTER OR WINDOWS EXPLORER YOU'LL BE ABLE TO JUST RIGHT CLICK ON THE FILE AND UNZIP IT FROM THERE OR UN-RAR IT FROM THERE
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S RIGHT
A LOT OF TIMES YOU'LL BE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PROJECT AND YOU'LL NEED TO FIND A SPECIFIC SHOT OR A SPECIFIC GRAPHIC AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO WASTE TIME DIGGING AROUND FOR THINGS THAT COULD EASILY JUST BE RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE
ALTHOUGH IF THAT HAPPENS YOU CAN ALWAYS GO BACK TO YOUR NIPPERS AND NIP A LITTLE PIECE THAT'LL FIT RIGHT IN THE SPACE AS NEEDED
ONE WENT RIGHT THROUGH ME PIERCING MY LUNG AND PUTTING A WHOLE IN IT THE OTHER IS STILL INSIDE MY CHEST
AS YOU ALSO SEE ON MY RIGHT HAND A CAST
WHAT THIS DOES IS IT STOPS YOUR BUDDY FROM GETTING SWUNG PARALLEL TO THE RIVER CURRENT AND GETTING STOPPED RIGHT ON THE EDDY LINE AND IT HELPS YOU PENETRATE ALL THE WAY INTO THE EDDY
THIS REQUIRES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SKILL AND ALSO ENTERING IN THE RIGHT PLACE REALLY COUNTS A LOT
THE WAY YOU WOULD HOOK IT UP TO THE LEASH IS RIGHT ON THE BOTTOM
ONE THE CLOTH SIDE GETTING THE SCISSORS RIGHT NEXT TO THE TAPE WILL HELP PREVENT FRAYING
IF YOU TRIM CLOCK WISE AROUND YOU CAN GET THE SCISSOR EDGE RIGHT NEXT TO THE TAPE
THE THICKER THE UPHOLSTERY IS AND THE MORE YOU CAN FEEL IT AND PULL ON IT AND IT GOES RIGHT BACK TO NORMAL NEW USE IS GOING TO SHOW YOU YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BETTER QUALITY PRODUCT
NOW WHAT I HAVE RIGHT HERE IS A PROJECT THAT I'M WORKING ON IT IS A COMPLETE FLASH WEBSITE DONE WITH PHOTOSHOP AND FLASH
NOW THIS IS THE HOME PAGE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT RIGHT HERE AND WHAT I LIKE TO FIRST DISCUSS IS THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING EVERYTHING ORGANIZED
AND SO BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE THE LENGTH OF THIS IF YOU BRING IT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH STICK TO ATTACH ITSELF TO THE TEDDY BEAR IT'LL FALL RIGHT OFF
AND SO YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GET SOME GOOD SPACE IN THERE AND RIGHT HERE I'VE GOT SOME GOOD SPACE AND THEN ONCE AGAIN RIGHT HERE
AN IMPORTANT THING ABOUT BASKETBALL IS HOW TO SHOOT A SHOT VERY VERY IMPORTANT THING YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW TO DO THIS FIRST YOU HAVE A BASKETBALL EITHER YOUR RIGHT HAND OR LEFT HAND AND I'M RIGHT HANDED SO I USE MY RIGHT HAND AS MY SHOOTING HAND MY LEFT HAND AS MY GUIDING HAND
IT'S REAL EASY TO GET LULLED INTO THE GROUP YOU ARE WITH SO YOU WANT TO GET OFF THE LINE QUICK AND YOU CAN PRACTICE THAT IN SWIMMING BY DOING SOME FAST FIFTIES RIGHT BEFORE YOU DO YOUR LONG SETS OR SOME THINGS LIKE THAT
IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO A LAKE TO SWIM WITH A LOCAL TRIATHLON CLUB OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND PRACTICE OPEN WATER SWIMMING THAT'S A GREAT THING TO DO YOU CAN PRACTICE DRAFTING OFF SOMEBODY WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SWIM RIGHT CLOSE BEHIND AND AGAIN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S JUST BEST TO EXPERIENCE BY DOING IT
SO YOU WANT TO REACH THE FINGERTIPS AS LONG AS POSSIBLE KEEPING THE SHOULDERS AWAY FROM THE EARS NAVEL SCOOPS IN TO LIFT YOU RIGHT BACK UP
SO YOU WANT TO GET THAT FLAT BACK THAT NAVEL SCOOPED IN AGAIN REACH UP AND OVER AND RIGHT SIDE
MY LEFT KNEE IS IN THE AIR CRANE MY RIGHT ARM IS EXTENDED OUT IN THE REVERSE PUNCH
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO SLEEP RIGHT THERE
ALSO NOTICE MY HAND IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO PULL THAT RIGHT ALONG THE TOOL REST
SARAH HAUER THE QUANTITY TYPE DIAGNOSIS SIG HAUER RIGHT
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TRYING TO COME UP RIGHT WHERE YOUR OTHER STITCH WAS SO IT LOOKS NICE AND EVEN
GENERALLY THEY GO BEHIND THE SEAT YOU SLIDE THEM IN BEHIND THE BACK END AND THEN BLOW THEM UP THROUGH THE AIR TUBE RIGHT HERE AND THEN STUFF THE AIR TUBE RIGHT BACK END AND YOU HAVE NOTHING TO GRAB ONTO
SO HERE WE GO AND I ROTATE THE PREHEATED MANDREL GRADUALLY AS I APPLY THE MOLTEN GATHER OF GLASS FROM MY FEED CANE WHICH IS IN MY RIGHT HAND
SO IF I'M LOOKING AT THE CAMERA AND THIS IS WHERE I'M PLACING IF I WAS THE PERSON GETTING INTERVIEWED AND THEN WHEN I'M INTERVIEWING THE PERSON I'LL BE SITTING JUST OFF TO THE RIGHT OF THE CAMERA SO THE PERSON GETTING INTERVIEWED WOULD BE LOOKING AT ME AT THIS DIRECTION
SO NOW THAT YOU'VE GOT YOUR BASE AND YOUR LID ALL FINISHED WITH THE KNOB YOU CAN CUT THIS RIGHT OFF THE BAT WITH YOUR WIRE TOOL BY PRESSING IT AGAINST THE BAT AND PULLING IT UNDERNEATH AND THEN TILT THAT PIECE RIGHT OFF THE BAT
YOU'RE GOING TO END UP PULLING TOWARDS YOURSELF RIGHT PULLING THE WATER AND AS YOU PULL THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP FOR A BREATH
IF YOU'RE NOT READY TO ANSWER RIGHT AWAY THEY'LL THINK YOU'RE BLUFFING
BETTER BE READY TO ANSWER RIGHT AWAY
YOU COULD BE BLUFFING BUT YOU BETTER BE READY TO ANSWER RIGHT AWAY TO CONVINCE THEM THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
THE BACK TOES WILL TURN AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE TOWARD THE RIGHT SO THEY ARE NOT AS OPEN AS IN SOME OF OUR OTHER STANDING POSES LIKE THAT BUT THEY ARE TURNED IN QUITE A BIT MORE DEEPLY
THEN YOU'LL HAVE YOUR NAME ARTHUR AUTHOR RIGHT HERE
AND THEN RIGHT HERE WE HAVE A PLAY IN ONE ACT OR TWO ACTS YOU CAN WHATEVER LENGTH OF PLAY YOU HAVE OR YOU COULD SAY A SERIAL COMEDY OR A COMEDY IN ONE OR TWO ACTS
WE'RE GOING TO COPYRIGHT A LITTLE LATER BUT RIGHT NOW THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WANT TO HAVE ON YOUR TITLE PAGE
ALSO IF YOUR PLAY IS BASED ON ANOTHER WORK YOU CAN PUT THAT RIGHT UNDER THE AUTHOR RIGHT THERE BASED ON A PLAY
USUALLY YOU CAN JUST SHAKE THE PIECE OF BONE AND ANY OF THE MEAT THAT'S ON THERE JUST FALLS RIGHT OFF JUST LIKE THAT
MAKE SURE THAT THEY ONLY GO IN THE RIGHT WAY
FOR INSTANCE WE CAN GET AN AFTER MARKET AMPLIFIER LIKE THIS UNIT RIGHT HERE
THEN AGAIN YOU CAN AN OFF-NAME BRAND AMPLIFIER THAT WE HAVE RIGHT HERE WHICH IT SAYS ON THE UNIT ACTUALLY IT SAYS THAT IT'S TWELVE HUNDRED WATTS
THIS UNIT RIGHT HERE IS AROUND 300 WATTS HOUR
YOU HAVE YOUR WIRE COMING OUT HERE AND THE CLOSURE RIGHT HERE
THE CRIMP BEAD AS A LITTLE SLICE RIGHT HERE IT IS ACTUALLY A CYLINDER AND YOU CAN SEE WHERE IT WAY SLICED TOGETHER
SO WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS I AM GOING TO TAKE OUR LEG AND MY TRUSTY LITTLE WORK BENCH HERE AND WE CAN MOUNT THIS RIGHT DOWN INSIDE AND TIGHTEN UP THE SUPPORTS TO HOLD THIS IN PLACE AND WHAT I WILL DO ONCE I HAVE GOT THAT DONE IS CHECK IT FOR LEVEL
BUT FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE A LITTLE BIT OLDER OR ADULTS ONE WAY OF DELIVERING THE MEDICATION I'LL SHOW YOU RIGHT HERE IS TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY AGAIN THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS DIRECTLY PUT THE MASK RIGHT ONTO HERE AND THEN OF COURSE THIS WOULD GO AROUND THE CHILD'S HEAD AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO JUST GO AHEAD AND BREATHE IN IT
AS THIS ALLOWS FOR SOME AIRFLOW OUT THE TUBE HERE THIS ALSO ALLOWS FOR SOME ESCAPING OF AIR AND MIST THROUGH THE HOLES RIGHT HERE
WHEN I PULL THE SLIDE BACK IT DON'T LOCK BACK SO YOU WANT TO PUSH UP ON THIS SLIDE STOP RIGHT ON THE SIDE SO WHEN I PULL THE SLIDE BACK PUSH UP ON THE SLIDE STOP
THAT TAKES SOME OF THE WEIGHT OFF OF GETTING THE DRAWING RIGHT
THEN RIGHT AS WE TURN OFF THE BOIL WE ARE GOING TO ADD IN ANOTHER HALF OUNCE OF CRYSTAL TO GIVE IT THAT NICE KIND OF NOBLISH HYPE AROMA
THE TRICK IS TO ALWAYS KEEP YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR RIGHT FOOT SO YOU'RE LEFT KNEE'S GOING TO BE THE ONE THAT'S BENDING THE WHOLE TIME

OKAY THE FIRST HOLE HAS BEEN REMOVED AND I'LL DO THE NEXT SERIES OF FOUR RIGHT NOW AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON FROM THERE
AS WE MOVE AROUND HERE KIND OF AN AWKWARD ANGLE BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE BLADE IS TOTALLY STRAIGHT AND AS WE SLOW IT DOWN READY TO MEET WITH THE OTHER END JUST SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND THE PIECE SHOULD JUST DROP RIGHT OUT
ON THIS VEHICLE THERE IS ACTUALLY A BRACE STRUCTURAL BRACE THAT COMES OUT ON EACH SIDE OF THE FRAME AND THAT IS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PLACE OUR JACK STAND RIGHT UNDER THERE

TAKE THAT RIGHT FOOT UP AND TAKE THAT STRAP AROUND THE BALL OF THE FOOT AND THEN EQUALIZE THE LENGTH OF THE STRAP AND AS YOU EQUALIZE THE LENGTH OF THE STRAP SECURE IT AROUND YOUR RIGHT HAND SO YOU HAVE A GOOD FIRM GRIP
FOR THE RIGHT HAMSTRING A STRAP CAN BE USED BY JUST LAYING RIGHT DOWN ON A SOFT SURFACE ON YOUR BACK AND BY DOING THIS TIP YOUR PELVIS FORWARD
IT'S STILL SHARP ENOUGH TO CUT US IF IT CAUGHT US AT THE RIGHT ANGLE
SO TO START THE GLAZING PROCESS WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE OUR GLAZE IS VERY WELL MIXED AND HAS THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY
AND LEFT RIGHT LEFT ROLL UP ON THAT FOOT SWITCH THE ARMS
THE CROSS-SHAPE CHANNELS THE PERSPIRATION FROM YOUR FOOT RIGHT OUT OF THE SOCK AND INTO THE OUTER LAYER OF YOUR SHOE
AND OUR FIVE SEVEN-CHORD COMES OUT OF OUR MAJOR RIGHT SO IF WE HAVE B C D E F WE JUST USE THE ONE MAJOR SCALE THAT WE ALREADY LEARNED OFF OF B AND WE CAN JUST START ON THE FIFTH DEGREE AND WE'LL HAVE OUR F SEVENTH SCALE
SO HERE'S OUR FLAT TWO RIGHT
NOW THE PEOPLE THAT RODE THESE BIKES IN THE THIRTIES FORTIES AND EARLY NINETEEN FIFTIES THEY'RE NOT INTO COLLECTING ANY BIKES RIGHT NOW SO THE VALUE ON THESE HAS DROPPED BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AS MUCH OF A DEMAND
WE'RE GOING TO FIT RIGHT IN THERE
THIS IS YOUR TYPICAL PIECE OF BASEBOARD RIGHT HERE
LOOK AT THEY'RE IN FRONT SEE THAT THEY'RE IN FRONT NOT RIGHT UNDERNEATH SO THAT I HAVE TO REACH AND PULL MYSELF FORWARD
OUR IS LOCATED RIGHT HERE

BASICALLY PUT YOUR GRIP RIGHT TOWARDS THE CENTER AND YOU ARE JUST GOING TO LIFT STRAIGHT UP THEN BRING YOUR ELBOWS DOWN PUSH STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN UP
THE ONLY FINGERS THAT DO NOT COVER A HOLE ARE THE LITTLE FINGER ON THE LEFT HAND AND THE THUMB ON THE RIGHT HAND
BUT RIGHT NOW YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS IMAGE IS TURNING BLUE
ALRIGHT NOW YOU'LL SEE BY PINCHING IT YOU'VE CREATED A CAVERN DOWN THERE SO GO AHEAD AND TAKE THAT CLAY THAT YOU MOVED FROM THE CENTER AND PUT IT RIGHT THERE FILL IN THAT HOLE O.K
SO THIS IS NUMBER ONE THIS IS TWENTY FOUR WE COUNT LEFT WE GO UP AND WE GO OVER TO THE RIGHT
REMEMBER YOU COUNT FROM YOUR RIGHT AS YOUR FIRST NUMBER AND THE UPPER RIGHT IS YOUR HIGHEST NUMBER
IF YOU THINK IF ANYTHING IS GOING TO RUB OFF OR THAT ALL LOOKS PRETTY GOOD RIGHT THERE
WE WILL TAKE A RING OF OUR WHITE ONION AND REMOVE THE OUTER LAYER OF SKIN AND WE'LL CUT RIGHT ACROSS DICING OUR ONION AND WE'LL PULL OUT TWO CLOVES OF GARLIC AND WE'LL CUT OFF THE BROWN STEM ENDS
HIS INSIDE FOOT COMES BACK AND HE IS RIGHT ALONG THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE
WHEN HE PULLS WE DON'T WANT THIS GUARD TO BE IN THE BACKFIELD BECAUSE WE MAY BE BRINGING A RUN RIGHT AHEAD OF HIM
ONCE HE GETS ON THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE HE'S GOING TO RUN A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE RIGHT DOWN THE LINE AND HE'LL HIT THE FIRST THING HE SEES IN THE OPPOSITE JERSEY
ONE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE RIGHT WAY TO WRAP UP THE BALL IF YOU TAKE THE HAND OFF IN THE WRONG WAY
YOU WANT TO PRACTICE WITH BOTH HANDS DOING THE TWO SO THAT YOU CAN BE PROFICIENT WITH BOTH YOUR LEFT HAND AND YOUR RIGHT
RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE
AND WE'LL START BY DRAWING THE EYES RIGHT HERE
MY NAME IS SYLVIA RUSSELL AND TODAY I'M GOING TO HELP YOU CHOOSE THE RIGHT HAIR COLOR FOR YOU

THE WEAPON I'M USING RIGHT NOW IS THE BATTLE RIFLE WHICH IS PROBABLY THE MOST VERSATILE WEAPON FOR THE AVERAGE ENCOUNTER IN HALO THREE
NOW ON THE FOREHAND SIDE YOU CAN GO LEFT BIG AND RIGHT AND YOU CAN COVER A HUGE AMOUNT OF COURT AND YOU USUALLY DO THAT WHEN YOU ARE UNDER SOME TYPE OF PRESSURE AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE IN THE STRONGEST POSITION SO YOU CAN SEE IF YOU ARE HERE YOU'RE IN KIND OF A RELATIVELY WEAK POSITION AND YOU CAN TURN IT AROUND AND IT WILL BE A GOOD SHOT BUT GETTING TO THE CORNER IN A MORE UPRIGHT POSITION IS BETTER
JASON JEANETTE ALL RIGHT HE'S SWIMMING THROUGH MY PUNCHES TO A CLINCH
IT WILL START WITH THE ANNOUNCER SAYING FLAGS UP AND A JUDGE SITTING RIGHT HERE AT THE FOWL LINE
SO YOU WANT TO PUSH DOWN WITH YOU LEFT FINGER USING YOUR RIGHT FINGER AS A SUPPORT
WE'LL GO RIGHT AND BACK
THEN WE'LL GO TO OUR RIGHT
AND WHAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT A SMALL FORWARD IS AND A POWER FORWARD IS
WE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SAY NO TO RESTARTING THE COMPUTER AND I'M GOING TO RIGHT CLICK AGAIN AND GO BACK TO MY PROPERTIES
LIKE I SAID THIS ONE IS IDEAL FOR ME BECAUSE IT'S IN A QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD I'VE GOT THE SHADE OF THIS UMBRELLA IF I NEED IT AND I CAN POP THAT OVER AND I'M KIND OF RIGHT HERE WITH A NICE BACKGROUND
I'M GOING TO APPLY IT RIGHT HERE ABOVE THE BLACK IT BLENDS INTO ALMOST A LITTLE BIT OF SILVER THERE
YOU JUST GOT TO STAY RIGHT BEHIND THEM
I MEAN YOU HAVE TO STAY RIGHT BEHIND THEM ON THIS CAR OR YOU WON'T PASS THE LEVEL YOU'LL OPT TO START ALL OVER AGAIN
WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY INFILTRATE THIS KIND OF RENDEZVOUS WITH ALL THESE ULTRANATIONALIST SOLDIERS AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO SNEAK RIGHT UNDERNEATH THEIR TRUCK
IT'S PRETTY FUNNY THERE'S ABOUT 100 GUYS HERE AND SOMEHOW NONE OF THEM SEE US WHEN WE COME RUSHING UP ON HERE BUT YOU DO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU STAY RIGHT ON CAPTAIN MACMILLAN'S [SOUNDS LIKE] SIX
AS YOU CAN SEE OUR GRAPHIC IS COMING RIGHT ALONG
RIGHT FOOT BACK TWO
RIGHT FOOT FORWARD FOUR
AS IT'S COMING DOWN I BRING MY HAND RIGHT UNDERNEATH IT AND IT LANDS ACTUALLY ON THE STRING AND IT'S ACTUALLY SPINNING BACKWARDS
WE WILL GO INTO LINING IN A MINUTE BUT THIS IS RIGHT NEXT TO THE HORSE'S SKIN
YOU WANT TO KEEP THEM RIGHT THERE
JOEL SIEGEL ALL RIGHT
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY THE UPBEAT OF THREE AND DOWNBEAT OF FOUR ALL RIGHT
WHAT KIND OF SEWING CAUSE THERE'S DIFFERENT PATTERNS RIGHT
I MEAN YOU COULD GO RIGHT NOW I'M JUST GOING IN AND OUT
THIS LITTLE ONE RIGHT HERE IS THIRTEEN SO SHE'S DEFINITELY A GERIATRIC DOG
SO IT'S NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR RIGHT NOW
SO IF YOU NOTICE THE GREEN CLUB WHICH IS STACKED ON TOP OF MY HAND LIKE THIS THAT WILL GO RIGHT BACK TO MY RIGHT HAND
WITH THE OUT LIP BACK HERE THE INNER LIP HERE AND THIS LITTLE AREA HERE AND THE DEEP AREA INSIDE WHICH IS RIGHT IN THERE
ALL RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO ADD IN ONE AND A HALF OUNCES OF LIGHT RUM THERE WE GO THAT'S ONE AND A HALF
ALL RIGHT ADD THAT IN THERE MMM MMM MMM
YOU KNOW YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT THERE IN THIS BOARD
BOARDS LIKE THIS RIGHT HERE FOR INSTANCE HAVE A LOT OF FLEX TO IT
MUTE ONE AND JUST USE TWO OF THEM AND YOU WANT TO PAN THAT TO THE LEFT AND TO THE RIGHT
IF YOU HAVE TWO ADLIB TRACKS YOU CAN BEGIN TO PAN ONE TO THE LEFT ONE TO THE RIGHT
WHEN HAVING JUST NOTHING ON AND JUST HAVING THE MAIN MONITOR LEVEL I CAN ADJUST IT RIGHT HERE RIGHT
SO RIGHT NOW I HAVE THE NS10S AND THE MACKIE A48S THE A24S HR
AND THEN PUT THAT RIGHT INTO THE BLENDER THAT'S FOUR EGGS NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD A 1/4 CUP OF WATER OUR 1/4 CUP OF OIL THE TRADITIONAL OIL TO USE WOULD BE SHMALTS SHMALTS IS A RENDER CHICKEN FAT IT'S NOT SO HEALTHY SO I LIKE TO USE A MIXTURE OF OLIVE OIL AND CANOLA OIL IT'S TWO TABLESPOONS OF OLIVE OIL AND TWO TABLESPOONS OF CANOLA OIL
NOW WHEN THE GLUE IS PARTIALLY DRY AS IT BEGINS TO DRY YOU CAN MOVE AND MANIPULATE THE BEADS A LITTLE BIT SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT WHEN IT'S WET AND YOU FIRST DO IT AND THEN GO BACK AROUND AFTER TO STRAIGHTEN OUT ANYTHING THAT MAY NOT BE STICKING IN THE RIGHT PLACE
I THINK WE ARE GOOD TO GO TIGHTEN IT UP AND WHEN I COME BACK I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT BITS YOU ARE GOING TO USE AND HOW TO DRILL THIS THING JUST RIGHT
IT'S A BAD SPOT TO TURN SOMEONE RIGHT AROUND INTO THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE GIVING HIM MOMENTUM TO STRIKE YOU WITH
SO YOU HAVE SOMEONE INSIDE THE CAR PUSHING DOWN ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AND ONCE THEY HAVE THE BRAKE PEDAL DOWN ALL THE WAY THEY WILL SAY DOWN AND YOU WILL LOOSEN THIS LITER VALVE RIGHT HERE IN THE LOOSEN DIRECTION AND LIQUID WILL COME OUT AND IT IS GOOD TO HAVE A CATCH CAN FOR THAT TOO BECAUSE IT GETS IN ALL THIS PAINT AND IT WILL EAT THAT OR WHEN YOU ARE DONE JUST WIPE IT ALL OFF AND ONCE YOU HAVE HAD IT SO THAT NO MORE LIQUID IS COMING OUT YOU TIGHTEN IT BACK UP AND YOU TELL THEM TO LET IT BACK UP AND THEY PUSH IT DOWN AGAIN AND YOU REPEAT THAT AND YOU OPEN THIS AGAIN AND BLEED IT OUT AND PERIODICALLY MAKE SURE YOU ARE CHECKING THE MASTER CYLINDER WHICH IS WHAT WE HAD OPENED AT FIRST AND WE USED THE TURKEY BASTER FOR FOR TAKING OUT THE FLUID AND YOU KEEP DOING THIS STEP OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON THIS PARTICULAR WHEEL UNTIL YOU GET NEW CLEAR FLUID COMING OUT AND THIS ONE IS DONE AND YOU WILL REMOVE THE NEXT ONE IN THE BACK AND THEN DO THE FRONT ONES
I HAVE A SENSE OF HOW FAST IT WOULD BE FROM HALFWAY AND THEN I TRY TO PUTT IT TO THAT HALFWAY POINT WITH THE RIGHT SPEED
AND I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND HAVE THIS STOP RIGHT HERE
AND WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND BRAID AROUND AND WE'LL MEET IT RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDDLE
THAT MEANS I'M GOING TO HAVE TO OPEN UP MY RIGHT LEG SO THAT IT'S NOT AGAINST HIS SIDE SAYING UHN-UH
HORSES MOVE AWAY FROM PRESSURE SO WHEN I SQUEEZE WITH MY LEFT LEG HE'S GOING TO WANT TO MOVE TO THE RIGHT
THEN I'M GOING TO OPEN UP MY RIGHT REIN AND SO HE HAS A PLACE TO GO HE'S ALREADY WANTING TO DO IT AND I'M GOING TO SQUEEZE WITH MY LEFT LEG
OR IF YOU DON'T WANT ANY COMMENTS ABOUT IT JUST UN-CLICK THAT AND THEN ON THE LEFT RIGHT NEXT TO THAT ON THE LEFT IS POST AND CLICK POST AND THEN IT'LL CONFIRM THE BULLETIN
BECAUSE SINCE YOU'RE A RIGHTY YOUR RIGHT HAND RIGHT ARM AND RIGHT SIDE IS GOING TO DO SO MUCH
YOUR LEFT SIDE YOUR WEAKER SIDE AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WEAKER IF YOU'RE A RIGHT HANDER TRY THROWING A BALL LEFTY SEE HOW FAR IT GOES
IT'S GOING TO DO SO MUCH YOUR RIGHT SIDE
AROUND IN A CIRCLE NICE AND CONTROL KEEPING THE BALL RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU
THE FIRST ONE IS JUST A SIMPLE BALL TOUCH RIGHT ON THE TOP OF THE BALL
RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT DRIBBLING IN ADVANCE DRIBBLING GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE TECHNIQUE
SO IT'S A GREAT WEAPON AND BECAUSE IT'S SO LOFTED THOUGH IT DOES TAKE A LOT OF PRACTICE TO GET IT TO WHERE YOU HAVE GOOD CONTROL WITH IT BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE COMING UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND YOU'RE LEARNING TO POP IT UP TO A GOOD TO THE RIGHT DISTANCE SO YOU GOT TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THE SIXTY DEGREE CLUB BUT IT'S A GREAT CLUB AND LET'S SEE HOW IT GOES HERE
TO GET THEM TO ACTUALLY CATCH IT IT'S REALLY THE SAME THING JUST A MATTER OF TIMING IT RIGHT LET'S TRY IT
THE TYPE OF FRISBEE WE'RE GOING TO USE IS ON THE GROUND RIGHT NOW JUST BECAUSE SHE GETS VERY EXCITED PIMAK AND JUST FOR ME PICKING IT UP SHE WOULD START GETTING EXCITED
SO WHAT I'VE DONE HERE IS DUG A HOLE AND PLACED A BUNCH OF LOOSE SAND IN IT AND I FILLED A FEW BUCKETS OF WATER UP CAME UP AND SATURATED THE SAND SO I HAVE GOOD WORKING SAND RIGHT NEXT TO THE SITE WHERE I'M BUILDING MY SANDCASTLE
SO I'M JUST GOING TO STOP RIGHT THERE AND LET YOU TAKE IT FROM THERE
SO WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW THIS IS CALLED A WHEEL WEDGE AND I'M BRING IT UP I'M BRINGING IT UP AND WHEN I'M COMING DOWN WITH IT IT'S GOING TO ELIMINATE ANY INCONSISTENCIES THREW OUT THE CLAY BODY AND THEN BRING IT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM HERE
YOU DON'T HAVE TO NECESSARILY DO IT ON THESE BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE PRESSING RIGHT INTO THAT
STILL UTILIZING THE STRAP LEFT HAND RIGHT I'M SORRY YOU HAD IT RIGHT HAND OKAY
YOU WOULD NORMALLY PAY A DESIGNER FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT EASIER BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING WELL IN GENERAL I WANT TO DOUBLE THE PRICE OF MY COSTS RIGHT
YOU CAN LINK TO THE MAP RIGHT HERE
ALL RIGHT LET'S DO THREE POINT LIGHTING AGAIN GUYS
ALL RIGHT AND NOW I'M LIT
AND THIS ACRYLIC PAINT IS GREAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH ANY POROUS SURFACE LIKE SHELLS OR WOOD IT'S GOING TO SOAK THAT PAINT RIGHT UP SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY PROBLEMS
RIGHT TOGETHER RIGHT SLIDE LEFT TOGETHER LEFT SLIDE
HERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS WE COULD DO YOU COULD ALSO KEEP IT STRAIGHT IF YOU WANTED BUT I LIKE THE CURVE AND WE'LL PUT IT RIGHT OVER THE TOP
RIGHT NOW LET'S FOCUS ON THE RIGHT HAND
OK ALL OF THESE BASS LINES THAT WE'RE LEARNING COMING UP IN COUNTRY AND BLUES STYLE ARE GOING TO BE PLAYED PIZZICATO USING THE FINGERS OF THE RIGHT HAND TO SOUND THE STRINGS
BUT THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT EFFECT THAT WE'RE NOT DOING RIGHT NOW
LET'S SEE I SEE A PIECE OF CHICKEN RIGHT HERE
I'LL GET THE CHICKEN RIGHT HERE
PUT THIS ON RIGHT HERE JUST SIMPLE ATTACHES TO THE DRYER
A LOT OF MY STUDENTS TEND TO GO ROUND OFF JUMP RIGHT FROM THE GROUND AND TURN
NOW THE TWO BY FOURS ACTUALLY CUT INTO LENGTHS RIGHT HERE
WE HAVE FINISHED SPREADING THE RASPBERRY PRESERVES EVENLY ON THE BOTTOM NOT TOO THICK JUST RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THE LITTLE MINIATURE TORTE OR THE INDIVIDUAL TORTE
LIKE WE MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE GRAPH-EYE SHAFT THEY HAVE THE WEIGHT OF THE SHAFT RIGHT HERE
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE RIGHT HERE THIS IS CALLED A PROJECT X RIFLE SHAFT
MAKE SURE THAT I GET A RIGHT BALANCE OF APPLES AND RAISINS NOT TOO MUCH OF ONE OR THE OTHER
RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO SET SOME UP TO RYAN
WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT FLAT SETS SETTING THE DISK UP FLAT AND TIPPING IT UP FLAT BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE REALLY GOING TO TRY TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO SET IT UP WITH AN ANGLE
NOW AGAIN THAT ANGLE IS COMING RIGHT FOR ME IF THE ANGLE GOES THIS WAY OR THAT WAY IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT HARDER TO CATCH THAT
GET ANOTHER ZERO BRING IT BACK UP TO RIGHT HERE TO WHERE THE LOOP STARTS BACK UP AGAIN
SO YOU WANT TO GO RIGHT INTO THAT CREASE AND MAKE SURE IT'S REALLY BLENDED AND THAT'S GOING TO REALLY HELP SHAPE YOUR EYES AND MAKE THEM LOOK OPEN
I'M USING MY BODY TO PUSH THIS BOAT SO I PLACE IT RIGHT HERE ON MY SHOULDER I HAVE A FIRM GRIP AND THEN STEP FORWARD TO PUSH
WITH MY RIGHT LEG I'M GOING TO KICK IT UP AND PUT IT ON MY SHOULDER
AND TYPICALLY IF THEY WERE GOING TO BE ON A HANGER THERE WOULD BE A MARKING APPROXIMATELY RIGHT THERE
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO USE AN INHALE TO EXTEND YOUR RIGHT LEG
HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THE BALL OFF THE WALL OR HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET IT BEFORE IT HITS THE WALL SO IF I HIT IT JUST RIGHT HE IS GOING TO HAVE A VERY VERY WEAK SHOT
RIGHT LIKE THAT SO BY KEEPING THE BALL AT THAT PART OF THE WALL THEY CAN'T ATTACK ME VERY MUCH SO I'LL USE THE BIG BALL
CHANTELLE TIBBS WHEN I DESIGN THE ORIGINAL REDISTRIBUTE THERE'S A STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY LOOK AT YOUR CLOTHES THEY LOOK AT YOU ANYTHING THAT'S WRITTEN THEY LOOK RIGHT HERE
I'M ACTUALLY WEARING THEM RIGHT NOW WITH SKINNIER JEANS WHICH ARE ALSO A STYLE
PRACTICE THAT IN THE MIRROR AND SOON YOU'LL BE DANCING RIGHT ACROSS THE DANCE FLOOR
RIGHT LEFT RIGHT SLIDE THE FOOT LEFT RIGHT LEFT VERY NICE GOOD ONE TWO THREE ONE TWO THREE
RIGHT LEFT RIGHT SLIDE THE FOOT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT
IN MY CASE I'M GETTING SOME GOOD CRACKS GOING RIGHT NOW
AND WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WHEN YOU PUT THE YOUR FILTER BACK ON YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ALL YOUR COMPONENTS IN THE RIGHT PLACE
AND THAT'S GOING TO LEAD INTO OUR ONE CHORD WHICH BRINGS US RIGHT AT THE TOP AGAIN
SO WE HAVE FLAT TWO FLAT SIX FIVE WHICH BRINGS US RIGHT BACK TO OUR ONE CHORD AND RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE TUNE
YOU'LL KNOW YOU'VE DONE ONE RIGHT WHEN YOU HEAR A NICE CRISP SOUND WHEN YOU LOCK YOUR TAIL OF YOUR BOARD AND YOUR WHEELS AND TRUCKS IN
MANY TIMES WE SEE AMATEURS JUST HITTING UP ON THE BALL AND HITTING WHERE THE CLUB FACE IS AHEAD OF THE HANDS AND THE WEIGHT REMAINS INTO YOUR BACK LEG YOUR RIGHT LEG FOR RIGHT HANDED PLAYERS
RIGHT NOW WE ARE GOING TO GO OVER SOME STRETCHES AND SOME EXERCISES TO GET YOU READY AND WARMED UP FOR BOWLING
AND I MIGHT DO IT ONCE OR TWICE RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING SO IT'S SECURE
WE'RE NOT DOING THAT RIGHT NOW
YOU CAN PUT ALL KINDS OF STUFF ON THE WEB SITE YOURSELF TALKING LIKE I AM RIGHT NOW YOU CAN HAVE VIDEO OF YOU DJ'ING WEDDINGS AND PARTIES
AND AS FAR AS YOUR TOP YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT TALL AND SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU ENOUGH AREA HERE TO MAKE YOUR CUT AND STILL HAVE SOME PORTION OF YOUR GOURD HERE RATHER THAN HAVING IT COMPLETELY FLAT HERE AND YOU KNOW YOUR SHAPE IS NOT GOING TO LOOK RIGHT
IF WE DECIDE WE WANT IT AHEAD AT THE POINT SIMPLY CLICK RIGHT THERE AND IF WE GET OUR SUB-SELECTION TOOL AND DRAG THAT OUT
REMEMBER HOW WE SPOKE ABOUT IF THERE'S A LITTLE BLACK ARROW IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER WHICH THERE IS ON THE PEN TOOL
KEEP ON THE WAY YOUR HANDS ON THE FLOOR BRING YOUR BODY TO THE RIGHT SIDE BREATH AND RELAX DROP YOUR HEAD
SO YOU WOULD BASICALLY JUST CUT YOUR HOLE RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF YOU ABSOLUTELY AND HAVE YOUR BUCKET OF BAIT OFF TO ONE SIDE AND JIG RIGHT OVER THE HOLE AND ALL THE TIME THE WIND IS AT YOUR BACK
MY RIGHT FOOT AND RIGHT HAND GO TOGETHER CAT STANCE PUNCH CHAMBER THE HEAD SIDE STEP DODGE CAT STANCE PUNCH

THAT'S SEVEN RIGHT THERE
HERE'S EIGHT NINE AND WE'RE GOING TO STOP RIGHT THERE
IT HAS SALT AND PEPPER RIGHT NOW
IF WE'RE MOVING TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT WE SHOULD ALSO TRY TO KEEP THAT SHOULDER ABOVE THE KNEE AT ALL TIMES SO THAT WE'RE NOT LEANING TOO FAR OFF TO ONE SIDE
SEE THAT RIGHT THERE
HE HAS A NEUTRAL STEP RIGHT HERE STEPPING IN STRONG RECOVERY BACK RIGHT THERE
NOW HERE'S THE ROOM RIGHT BEFORE THE EXIT AND WE CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL TURRETS IN HERE
KIND OF MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE STAYING IN RIGHT POSITION
THIS IS YOUR OUTFLOW RIGHT HERE
SO FOR THIS EXERCISE ONE FOOT'S FORWARD LEFT OR RIGHT AND AGAIN LEFT OR RIGHT FOOT'S FORWARD
SAME WORKS FOR THE SPRAYER WE HAVE TO CLEAN THIS RIGHT AWAY
IF YOU HAVE YOUR CAN YOU KNOW THE AEROSOL CAN AND THERE'S STILL SOME PRODUCT LEFT IN IT YOU NEED TO CLEAN THAT RIGHT AWAY
BECAUSE IT'LL JUST SLIP RIGHT OUT NO MATTER HOW MUCH WEIGHT YOU OR LOAD YOU PUT ON IT
YOU MIGHT SEE DIARRHEA OR OTHER SIGNS THAT THEY'RE JUST NOT QUITE RIGHT
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN REMOVE THESE SMALL PIECES OUT OF HERE THAT'S WHY WE HAD TO MAKE THE HOLE IN THERE FIRST IS TO PUT THE SAW BLADE IN REMOVE IT FROM THE SAW PUT THE SAW BLADE IN AND THEN CUT AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO RIGHT NOW
NOW AGAIN YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE FIRST STARTING TO CATCH FRISBEES BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IT'S SPINNING IF IT HAS A LOT OF SPIN AND IT HITS YOUR PALM IT'S GOING TO SPIN RIGHT OUT
TO GET STARTED ON THIS SCARF IT SHOULD BE HOW THIS LOOKS RIGHT HERE
AND WITH A GENTLE MOTION NO TUGGING A GENTLE PATTING MOTION YOU WANT TO GO RIGHT TO HERE ALL THE WAY INTO THE EYE
AND SO THEN FAITH CAN JUST LOWER RIGHT TO THAT POINT AND THEN BRING HER WEIGHT FORWARD AND COME RIGHT UP INTO YOUR UP DOG
AND IT'S ON MY SCREEN RIGHT NOW
THIS IS WHERE I USUALLY GET MYSELF IN TROUBLE BECAUSE I TRY TO MAKE IT TOO THIN BUT WE'RE NO WHERE NEAR THAT POINT RIGHT NOW
SO FINDING THE RIGHT SEAT HEIGHT IS ANOTHER MATTER ENTIRELY
FOR BIKES THAT DON'T HAVE QUICK RELEASE LIKE THIS IT BASICALLY LOOKS LIKE THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS DUAL LEVER IT IS JUST A BOLT THE BOLT IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND NOT THE LEFT SIDE LIKE THIS ONE CAUSE THERE IS A LEVER ON THE OTHER SIDE
SEAT TO HIGH ALSO NOT EFFICIENT ALSO RIGHT FOR INJURY
RIGHT THERE THE MECHANICAL WELD HAS BEEN BROKEN AS YOU CAN SEE OUR UPPER BALL JOINT IS NOW FREE AND WE'RE READY TO CONTINUE WITH THE REST OF THE DISASSEMBLING PROCEDURE

NOW I'VE STILL GOT MY HALTER LEAD ROPE RIGHT HERE SO THAT IF HE DOES GET TOO SCARED I STILL HAVE A HOLD OF HIM
WE WOULD TAKE THE REINS OVER HER HEAD AND WE ARE GOING TO COME AROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE AND RUN THE RIGHT STIRRUP UP
RIGHT TO THE EDGE OF WHERE THE ZIPPER IS
HAVE THE LINING PULLED OUT ON ONE SIDE AND THE FABRIC IS A LITTLE AWAY FROM THE ZIPPER SO JUST MOVE IT OVER RIGHT TO THE EDGE
LET ME DO THAT RIGHT QUICK
I'M JUST GONNA WIPE IT OUT WHICH MEANS BRING IT ALL THE RIGHT SIDE OUT
WE NOW HAVE OUR SINGLE WHIP WE CAN STEP OUT AND DROP THE RIGHT HAND LIKE WE DID BEFORE
SO WE FINISHED OFF WITH GOLDEN ROOSTER SO OUR RIGHT KNEE IS UP AND OUR LEFT HAND IS DOWN
WHAT THAT MEANS IS BASICALLY THOSE ARE THE TWO GOVERNING BODIES FOR THE SPORT OF KITE SURFING RIGHT NOW
IN THE SPORT RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW IT'S ABSOLUTELY JUST GROWING LIKE A WILDFIRE
IN THIS CASE PUT IT INTO YOUR CAMERA WHICH WILL THEN SEND IT RIGHT BACK OUT
WE'LL PUT THAT RIGHT INTO THE CAMERA AND THEN PLUG THE VIDEO WHICH IS THE YELLOW COMPOSITE INTO THE VCR VIDEO OUT
SO YOU SEE THAT WE JUST DREW IN A VOLUME CHANGE AND AS THE SONG PLAYS ONCE IT GETS TO THAT POINT IT'S GOING TO START FADING DOWN AND THEN ONCE IT GOES BACK TO THE NEXT LOOP IT GOES RIGHT BACK UP TO ZERO
WHEN THEY HAVE HOLES IN IT YOU CAN PULL THE HAIR RIGHT OUT OF THE HOLE WITH THIS NEEDLE HERE THIS LITTLE STUFF RIGHT HERE AND YOU CAN PULL IT OUT AND IT COMES OUT OF THERE YOU CAN HIGHLIGHT LIKE THAT
SHE'S GOING TO INHALE DRAW BOTH KNEES IN TOWARDS HER HEART AND THEN AS SHE EXHALES SHE IS GOING TO REACH BOTH KNEES SIMULTANEOUSLY OVER TOWARDS HER RIGHT HAND

THEY ARE NOT ASYMMETRICAL AS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT HERE NEXT TO THE BALL JOINT GREASE BOOT THERE IS AN L
WE CAN GO AHEAD AND PLACE THE OTHER PIECE OF FELT AND PUT IT RIGHT ACROSS THE TOP AND THAT WILL ALSO COMPLETE THE LOOK OF THE CURTAINS
AND ONCE THAT'S COVERED THE WHOLE SURFACE OF THE STRIP WE'RE GOING TO LAY THE MATCHSTICKS RIGHT ON TOP
IN THIS BOX RIGHT HERE I CAN PLAY MY SONGS BY HITTING THE PLAY BUTTON ON THE LEFT AND ALSO ON THE RIGHT
YOU COME UP ON THE BOTTOM AND COME RIGHT OUT THE TOP
I'VE ADDED A SONG I CREATED IN GARAGE BAND DOWN HERE AT THE BOTTOM OF MY SLIDE SHOW AND IF I SELECT THAT COME OVER AND SELECT THE OPTIONS BUTTON ON THE RIGHT
SO YOU'RE JUST GOING TO FEED IT THROUGH COME RIGHT UP AND THAT'S HOW YOU RIG A BAIT FISH
THE MOST POPULAR WAY IS THROUGH THE DORSAL FIN RIGHT BEHIND THE DORSAL FIN WHICH IS THIS IS THE DORSAL FIN RIGHT HERE

AS I'M GOING INTO MY NEXT SECTION I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE WAYS OF KNOWING IF IT'S NOT RIGHT OR TIGHT
IF YOU DON'T HAVE BIG LIPS AND YOU WANT TO DRAW ON SOME LIPS WITH A NEUTRAL LIP LINER DO THAT AND THEN PUT THE LIP GLOSS RIGHT ON TOP OF IT
NOW WHEN IT COMES BACK DOWN IT'S GOING TO FALL ONTO THAT BOTTOM STRING AND THAT'S RIGHT WHERE YOU STARTED FROM AGAIN
I'VE GOT A LITTLE DRY ERASE BOARD RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THAT I ALWAYS KEEP IN FRONT OF MY WHEEL THAT TELLS ME THE BASIC WEIGHTS AND SIZES OF SOME OF MY SIMPLE ITEMS LIKE THIS IS A SALAD BOWL
THAT IS GOING TO COME RIGHT OFF
SO THIS IS GOING TO GO INSIDE YOUR LAMP RIGHT AND IT'S GOING TO CREATE A HOT SPOT RIGHT BELOW IT
SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST GOING TO FOCUS ON KEEPING IT IN PLAY IN BETWEEN THE TWO LINES OF THE DOUBLES ALLEY
THERE'S NO REMOVING THE FAT CAP ON THIS KIND OF MEAT IT'S JUST GOING TO FALL RIGHT A PART LIKE THAT
YOU SEE IT TIGHTENS RIGHT ON UP AND IT WOULD HOLD SOMETHING AND YOU USE THIS FOR ANYTHING
SO YOU'LL HAVE THE POINT GUARD UP TOP YOU'LL HAVE A FORWARD RIGHT HERE A CENTER WILL BE A LITTLE FURTHER BACK BUT WHAT YOU'LL HAVE IS YOU'LL HAVE A SMALL FORWARD HERE YOU'LL HAVE THE SHOOTING GUARD ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SUPPORT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEFENSE
THERE ARE OTHER MOMENTS WHEN YOU MIGHT BE PLAYING ALONG WITH THE BAND AND FOR SOME REASON IT DOESN'T REALLY SOUND RIGHT OR IT MIGHT SOUND CLUTTERED IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE THERE'S TOO MUCH GOING ON AND THAT'S ANOTHER WAY TO SHOW THAT MAYBE YOU PLAYING THERE REALLY ISN'T APPROPRIATE WITH THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS
BRING YOUR ABDOMINALS IN AND MAKE SURE THAT YOUR HIPS ARE STACK RIGHT ON TOP OF THE OTHER
I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND THROW IT OUT RIGHT NOW FOR EITHER OR AND IT'S CALLED MATH RAP'

THEY BOTH SAY ARTIFACT CREATURE ON THEIR TYPE AND THEY BOTH HAVE POWER AND TOUGHNESS IN THE LOWER RIGHT HAND CORNER
SO IF YOU START FROM A DEAD STILL TWO BALLS IN YOUR RIGHT HANDS IT WOULD BE THROW THROW HAND OFF
IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE GUARD STAYS AT A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE RIGHT DOWN THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE
AND ON A FAST CLOTH LIKE THIS IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE HIT RIGHT IN THE CENTER AND SLIDE ALL THE WAY OVER TO THAT BALL AND STOP
AND AGAIN MOST OF THESE HAVE A LITTLE HOOK RIGHT HERE SO THAT YOU CAN WRAP THE CHAIN AROUND THE HANDLE AND THEN HOOK IT ONTO ITSELF SO YOUR CHAIN DOESN'T FALL INTO YOUR CUP
PUT THEM ON RIGHT THERE ON TOP HERE THESE ARE ALL NICE TOPPINGS
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OTHER ELBOW STRIKES AN NOW IS WE'RE STRIKING THE PART BEHIND YOUR ELBOW TOWARD YOUR TRICEP AREA THAT'S THE THE PART OF YOUR ELBOW THAT'S GOING TO HIT YOUR TARGET RIGHT NOW
SO START RIGHT HERE AS WE MOVE IN TOWARD THAT OPPONENT MALE A CIRCLE TIGHTEN THAT WRIST UP AND STRIKE I WANT TO DROP MY WHOLE BODY WEIGHT DOWN OVER THAT PERSON
RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO WE'VE PLANTED THE SEED WE'VE TAKEN GOOD CARE OF IT AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME HARVESTING
IT GIVES YOU SOME FLEXIBILITY IF YOU DECIDE TO GO OVER THE FIFTEEN MINUTES WHETHER A TEAM IS HERE ON TIME OR NOT BUT THEY USUALLY LIKE TO GET THINGS STARTED RIGHT WHEN THE TIME OF THE GAME IS SCHEDULED AND THEY USUALLY LIKE TO END IT RIGHT WHEN THE TIME OF THE GAME IS SCHEDULED
SO FROM HERE I'VE GOT HIM PINNED HERE AND IF HE STARTS TO GET AWAY I CAN TRANSITION INTO A STRIKE TO A HEAD GRAB TO A KNEE DROP ANYTHING THAT I NEED IS RIGHT HERE AT MY FEET
YOU'LL ALSO SEE I MOVED RIGHT INTO THE PIN THAT I DISCUSSED BEFORE
ALMOST ALL THE BLEEDER VALVES ARE AT THE TOP OF THE WHEEL OR THE BACKING PLATE OF THE WHEEL AND THEY ALL LOOK ABOUT THE SAME KIND OF LIKE A LITTLE HEX A SMALL SPOT AND A HOLE RIGHT THERE SO WHEN YOU LOOSEN IT USE A WRENCH SO YOU CAN SEE THE FLUID COMING OUT AND THAT WAY YOU CAN TELL WHEN THE NEW FLUID IS COMING IN ALL THE CLEAR THE NEW FLUID AND YOU CALL SEE WHEN ALL THE OLD STUFF IS FLUSHED OUT OF THE SYSTEM CLEANLY
SO SIT HERE PRACTICING RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT MAKE SURE YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR POSTURE THINK ABOUT YOUR THROWS THINK ABOUT THE SPIN A LOT OF THINGS TO KEEP TRACK OF I KNOW BUT PRACTICE ENOUGH AND YOU'LL GET IT CLEAN
SO IT'S LEFT RIGHT CATCH CATCH RIGHT LEFT CATCH CATCH
I WANT YOU TO TRY AND KEEP THAT GOING AS FLUIDLY AS POSSIBLE RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT
NOW YOU JUST WANT TO COME TO THE WHEEL AND GET THIS PIECE CENTERED BUT FIRST BEFORE WE START THROWING ANYTHING MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR WEAR BOARD READY FOR WHEN THOSE LITTLE CUPS START COMING OFF WE'RE JUST GOING TO POP THEM RIGHT ONTO TO THERE
AS YOU CAN SEE OUR OS IS RIGHT HERE IN THIS LIST
THAT'S RIGHT TWENTY MINUTES
THAT RESETS THE STRETCH RECEPTOR ON THE MUSCLE AND PUTS IT BACK AT AN APPROPRIATE SETTING AND MIRACULOUSLY THE PAIN GOES AWAY RIGHT AWAY
AND WE'RE GOING TO SHOW IT GO YOU RIGHT NOW
IT'S ALSO TO PUT BIRD SEED RIGHT ON THE GROUND LOTS OF BIRDS WILL HAPPILY FEED ON THE GROUND AND ACTUALLY DON'T LIKE TO NECESSARILY FEED OFF THE GROUND
DON'T WORK SO HARD THAT YOU'RE STRESSED OUT TRYING TO SING IT RIGHT
I'M JUST PEELING THE THIN SKIN OFF THE VEGETABLE PEELER IS USEFUL FOR THIS AS OPPOSE TO A PAIRING KNIFE BECAUSE YOU SEE HOW THIN THE SKIN IS AND HOW EASILY IT JUST COMES RIGHT OFF WITHOUT SACRIFICING ANY OF THE CARROTS
TO BEGIN WITH YOU'RE GOING TO STEP OUT WITH YOUR FEET SHOULDER DISTANCE APART NOW THIS IS THE INSIDE WIDTH OF YOUR SHOULDERS RIGHT
A LOT OF ARTISTS ARE OUT THERE AND THEY'RE TRYING BUT MAYBE THEY'RE NOT MARKETED RIGHT OR MAYBE THE MANAGEMENT ISN'T RIGHT OR MAYBE THEY'RE NOT ON TOUR OR MAYBE THEIR MUSIC ISN'T THAT GOOD
SOME BAND SAWS COME IN 220 SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR PLUGGING IT IN THE RIGHT OUTLET
I HAVE THIS POWER STRIP RIGHT HERE
TABS AS I INDICATED RIGHT HERE ARE GOING TO BE ATTACHED TO THE COLLAR AND WHEN YOU FOLD THE COLLAR DOWN AND OVER THEN THEY'LL BE BUTTONED UP WITH BUTTONS THAT ARE ATTACH TO THE SHIRT
IF THIS BOTHERS YOUR SHOULDERS THAT'S A SIGN THAT SOMETHING'S GOING ON YOU CAN KEEP IT RIGHT HERE AND NOT GO SO FAR LOW
ONCE IT'S ON PAPER WE THEN TAKE THEIR BODY PART WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT ON SEE IF IT FITS RIGHT
IF IT FITS RIGHT THEN WE MAKE A STENCIL OUT OF IT AND WE APPLY IT TO THEM AND SIMPLY TATTOO IT
THEN THE OTHER OBVIOUS ONES NEEDS ARE THE VCR USED TO PLAY YOUR VHS TAPES AND YOUR COMPUTER USED TO CAPTURE THEM ALONG WITH THE RIGHT SOFTWARE
I HAVE A BUNCH OF THEM TIED RIGHT HERE
WE'RE GOING TO BE AT EIGHTY FOR ALL THESE BEATS ALL RIGHT
AND AS I'M PLAYING WITH BEAT ONE ON THE KICK BEATS TWO AND FOUR ON THE SNARE AND 8TH NOTES ON THE HI-HAT I WANT YOU TO BE THINKING TRY AND CONCEPTUALIZE WHERE THINGS ARE LINING UP WHICH LIMBS ARE GOING TO BE LINING UP WITH EACH OTHER AND ON WHICH BEAT ALL RIGHT
JOEL SIEGEL ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE GOING TO START OUT WITH THE BASS DRUM
AND THE LAST TWO PIECES THAT WE NEED ARE KIND OF HARD TO SEE BUT THEY ARE RIGHT IN HERE IT'S BASICALLY THE LINING TO MAKE THE DRAWSTRING OPENING AND WHEN WE GET CLOSER TO THIS YOU WILL SEE EXACTLY HOW I'M GOING TO PUT THIS IN
I SET THAT JUST RIGHT NEXT TO THE LINE NOT ON THE LINE BUT NEXT TO IT
SHE'S GOING TO CHAMBER THE HANDS TO THE WAIST START FROM THIS POSITION AND HANDS A LITTLE BIT LOWER ONE AND TWO BOTH HANDS COME OUT THE SAME TIME FIST GOOD KEEPING THEM RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR SHOULDERS OPEN THE HANDS THE PALM CROSS ONE WRIST OVER THE OTHER WRIST BRING THE HANDS DOWN TOUCH THE THIGHS NOW LIFT UP BEND THE ELBOWS AND COME FORWARD
AND ONCE AGAIN YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT RIGHT ALONG THE SCORE LINES
HERE'S ONE SHAPE RIGHT HERE HERE'S ANOTHER HOUSE PATTERN THATS MUCH SIMPLER THIS IS ONE THAT YOU MIGHT FIND OUT THERE TOO
AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE BOW AND THE ROSIN THAT YOU USE TO MAKE THE BOW ACTIVATE THE STRING
YOU ARE GOING TO PULL UP NEXT TO THE CAR UNTIL YOUR REAR TIRES ARE PRETTY MUCH AT THE REAR OF THE CAR THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE PARKING BEHIND AND THEN YOU ARE GOING TO PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE TURN YOUR WHEELS AND SLOWLY START BACKING UP AND THEN ONCE YOU GET ABOUT HALF WAY BACK TOWARDS THE CURB AND YOUR FRONT TIRES ARE CLEAR OF THE CAR IN FRONT OF YOU THEN YOU ARE GOING TO START STEERING BACK THE OTHER WAY AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO JUST SLIDE RIGHT IN THERE AND BE RIGHT BEHIND THE CAR
I CAN LIFT THE HAIR UP AND SEE THAT MY GUIDE OF THE PREVIOUSLY CUT HAIR IS RIGHT UNDERNEATH THAT
THE COOL THING ABOUT REASON IS THAT IT AUTOMATICALLY RECOGNIZES WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO DO WITH THESE ITEMS RIGHT HERE
AND SO RIGHT NOW I'M JUST GOING TO SAVE THIS OPTION AND I'LL EXPLAIN TO YOU IN THE NEXT PART HOW TO SAVE THIS INTO YOUR OWN TEMPLATE AND MAKE THIS YOUR DEFAULT SETTING
NOW YOU CAN RENAME THOSE I'M JUST GOING TO LEAVE THEM HOW THEY ARE RIGHT NOW
ONE MORE TIME WE'LL GO RIGHT HERE BRING IT BACK BOOM WE'LL GO HERE BRING IT BACK BOOM
YOU CAN STRETCH OUT YOUR HIP FLEXORS IN THE FRONT OF YOUR HIPS BY KNEELING ON ONE KNEE AND PUSHING YOUR HIPS FORWARD STRETCHING OUT YOUR BACK MUSCLES BY SITTING RIGHT BACK ON YOUR HEELS AND REACHING ACROSS YOUR BODY
THE TOSS IS THE HARDEST AND THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE SERVE AND BASICALLY WHAT YOU DO ON THE TOSS YOU ARE THROWING THE BALL RIGHT WHERE YOU NEED IT TO BE IN ORDER TO HIT THE SHOT
MOVE THE STRING AND MAKE SURE IT'S IN THE RIGHT SLOT AND THE NUT YOU WANT IT IN THE FIRST SLOT
ALL RIGHT GOOD FATS BAD FATS WHAT'S THE SKINNY ON FATS
NEXT IS THE CAPTIVE BEAD AND THE CAPTIVE BEAD IS A SMALL HOOP WITH THE BALL SUSPENDED SIX DAYS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND THE BALL POPS RIGHT OUT AND SHOULD POP RIGHT BACK IN LIKE THIS
