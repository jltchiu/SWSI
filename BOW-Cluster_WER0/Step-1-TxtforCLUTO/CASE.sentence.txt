I'M USING TWO CUPS OF RICE AND THAT IS WHY I'M DOING IT SOMETIMES WHAT I DO IS I SET A LITTLE BIT MORE ASIDE JUST IN CASE I SPILL IT OR ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENS
SO IN THAT CASE YOU CAN JUST NAIL IN A BROADHEAD NAIL OR JUST A STANDARD COMMON NAIL AND THAT'LL HOLD THAT
IN THIS CASE IT'S THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH SO IT WOULD COME UP FROM THE LINE AT WHERE WE WANT IT WE WOULD MEASURE THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH DOWN AND THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD DRIVE OUR NAIL
THAT LOOKS VERY FUNNY MAYBE I COULD DO A BETTER JOB IN A YEAR BUT IN ANY CASE THAT'S HOW IT WORKS AND THERE WE HAVE USING SELF MADE BOOKS
IN THIS CASE IT'S ONE OF THE BRAIDED ONES IT'S VERY EASY TO UNDO
IN THIS STEP I AM GOING TO DEMONSTRATE THE PROPER JACKING PROCEDURE FOR GETTING THE FRONT END OF OUR TRUCK UP SO WE CAN FIT UNDERNEATH TO CHANGE OUR TRANSFER CASE FLUID
TODAY WERE GOING TO CHANGING THE FLUID IN OUR FOUR WHEEL DRIVE TRANSFER CASE
I PREFER USING OLD BOOK CASES I MEAN I'M SORRY I PREFER USING OLD BOOKS BUT A LOT OR MOST PEOPLE HAVE THE NEW BOOKS BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE READING AND SO WHAT I DID IS I PRETTY MUCH PUT BOOKS IN THIS BOOK CASE AND THEN I ONCE IN A WHILE I PUT A NEAT ACCESSORY OR A FUN ACCESSORY IN IT
IT'S TRYING TO LOOSEN DIRT BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I'M USING A LITTLE BIT OF A DAMP SOIL BECAUSE OFTENTIMES WHEN WE'RE POTTING OUR PLANTS YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE HAVE A LITTLE WATER IN THERE TOO
NOW IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A WHITE TEQUILA BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A WHITE TEQUILA YOU CAN USE ANY TEQUILA THAT YOU HAVE IN THIS CASE WE'VE GOT GOLD TEQUILA
IN THIS CASE THE MOSQUITO GUARD EVEN THOUGH IT IS ONLY A ONE ONE CAN DEFEAT THE CRESTED CRAGHORN BECAUSE ITS TOUGHNESS IS ONLY ONE
AND IN SOME CASE THE MANUFACTURER'S STOP SELLING THAT SHOE ALL TOGETHER FOR INSTANCE THIS PAIR I CAN STILL GET ON A POPULAR RETAIL SITE BUT WHEN I WENT STRAIGHT TO THE MANUFACTURER'S SITE TO SEE IF I CAN GET IT CHEAPER THEY WEREN'T SELLING IT ANYMORE
WELL THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE
THE WIDTH IS IMPORTANT THE BOLSTER IS VERY IMPORTANT THE LOCKING MECHANISM ON YOUR NECK SUPPORT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND YOU DEFINITELY NEED A CASE
IF YOU FEEL HEAT IN THE JOINT YOU MAY ALSO FIND THE THE DOG MAY OBJECT A BIT AND ALSO IN THIS CASE DON'T DO AS MUCH OF IT JUST DO A MINUTE OR TWO SEE WHAT HE'LL TOLERATE AND THEN TRY AGAIN THE NEXT TIME YOU ARE DOING A SESSION AND GRADUALLY WORK YOUR WAY UP AND YOU'LL FIND THAT THIS WILL GET EASIER AS YOU WORK WITH THE ANIMAL AND THE GENERAL ENERGY IS FLOWING SOME OF THE STIFFNESS IS RELIEVED THEN THEY ARE GOING TO BE MORE LIKELY TO TOLERATE THIS PARTICULAR AREA BEING MASSAGED
A DOG WITH ELBOW DYSPLASIA DOESN'T LIKE THIS MASSAGE TO START WITH IN WHICH CASE YOU WANT WITH JUST SOME SOFT GENTLE MOVEMENT JUST MOVE YOUR HANDS OVER THE SKIN DON'T PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON IT AND GRADUALLY WORK YOUR WAY UP
IN THIS CASE THIS PERSON WOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP THREE CARDS AND ACTUALLY BREAK UP A FLUSH THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE
IN THIS CASE THIS BOARD IS GOING TO BE SET UP FOR SOMEBODY WHO RIDES REGULAR AND AGAIN YOU ARE GOING TO NEED TO DETERMINE YOUR STANCE BEFORE YOU CAN MOUNT THEM
USUALLY THAT IS NOT THE CASE
ANOTHER WAY WOULD BE TO ACTUALLY OPEN UP THE CASE IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW MANY RAM MODULES YOU HAVE
YOU COULD OPEN UP YOUR CASE AND THEN INSPECT THAT AND SEE HOW MANY RAM MODULES IF YOU'RE LOOKING BECAUSE YOU WANT TO UPGRADE YOUR RAM THE RAM AND THE OR MEMORY IN YOUR COMPUTER
YOU WANT TO GRIP THE RINGS SO THAT THE FINGER YOU'RE SPINNING ON IN MY CASE IT'S THE MIDDLE FINGER IS ALREADY IN POSITION TO ACCEPT THE RINGS
BUT IN CASE YOU DON'T BOOK IN ADVANCE THEN YOU SHOULD GO TO A TRAIN ATTENDANT AND ASK THE TRAIN ATTENDANT WHERE TO GO AND WHAT TO DO
IF YOU WANT TO IDENTIFY YOUR CAR IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL YOU KNOW BUT JUST IN CASE YOU BOOK YOUR TICKET IN ADVANCE
SO IF THE CASE BECOMES VERY EXTREME THE DOG MIGHT NEED SOME MEDICAL ATTENTION
IN THIS CASE WE WOULD PUT EQUAL AVERAGE WHICH IS THE NAME OF THE FORMULA WE ARE LOOKING FOR TELLING TELLING EXCEL TO TAKE THE AVERAGE OF THE NUMBERS THAT APPEAR BETWEEN THESE CELLS BECAUSE WE HAVE A2 AND WE HAVE A COLON IN-BETWEEN AND THAT MEANS THROUGH A6
A LOT OF KEYBOARDISTS A LOT OF MUSICIANS TEND TO FEEL WHEN THEY'RE PLAYING IN A LIVE BAND THAT THEY NEED TO BE PLAYING ALL THE TIME AND THAT REALLY REALLY ISN'T ALWAYS THE CASE
AND THEN HIT THE G AND THEN A PINCH BETWEEN THE D OR IN THIS CASE FRETTING MAKES IT AN E NOTE WITH E HIGH E AND THEN OPEN B OR ACTUALLY NOT AN OPEN B IT'S GOING TO BE C FIRST FINGER SECOND FRET ON THE A MINOR CHORD
AND IN THIS CASE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A ROPE CLIPPED IN TO THE BACK HERE AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE DIVING OUT ATTACHED TO THE END OF THAT ROPE WITH SOMEONE ON SHORE HOLDING THE END
SECOND OF ALL MOST DOCUMENTARIES TODAY HAVE SOME DEGREE OF NARRATION OR SOMEONE THAT BASICALLY GUIDES AN AUDIENCE THROUGH THE PRESENTATION OR A HOST WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE SOMEONE WHO'S ACTUALLY ON CAMERA GUIDING PEOPLE THROUGH AND A LOT OF TIMES IT'LL BE BOTH
IN THIS CASE YOU HAVE THE CAMPSITE THAT'S DESIGNATED AS SITE FIVE YOU HAVE KIND OF NICE CLEARLY LAID OUT AREA THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR CAMPING AND YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR CAMPING ACTIVITIES RIGHT WITHIN THIS AREA AND NOT GO OUTSIDE THEM
MAKE SURE YOU IN CASE THE ENTIRE THING BECAUSE IT IS CREATING A SORT OF INSULATION FOR THE ICE CREAM
OR SOME HAIR SPRAY IN THIS CASE
ONE PARTICULAR CASE I CAN THINK OF WAS A GENTLEMAN ABOUT 65 YEARS OLD A RETIRED SCHOOL TEACHER HIS BACK HAD GONE OUT
IN THIS CASE WE'RE GOING TO LIFT UP THE MIDDLE FINGER HERE AND TURN THIS F SHARP INTO AN OPEN E STRING
CASE AN POINT ON MY PICTURE I ONLY HAD A CRAB SITTING OVER HERE ON THE LOWER PART
SO IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO MOVE HIS HEAD TO THE RIGHT
IN THIS CASE THERE IS REALLY NOT TOO MUCH BECAUSE WE ARE USING A LIGHTWEIGHT SPACKLE SO JUST GIVE IT A WIPE ON YOUR JEANS AND THAT SHOULD BE FINE
IN THIS CASE I'LL BE ONE FIVE JEFF WILL THE SIX TEN AND LOUIS WILL BE ELEVEN FIFTEEN
SO HE THROWS THE PUNCH HERE AND WORST CASE SCENARIO HE DROPS STRAIGHT DOWN I JUST TAKE HIM OVER
IN THIS CASE IT WAS BRINGING OUR F SHARP DOWN TO AN F NATURAL
EVEN IN A WORD THIS IS THE BEGINNING SOUND AND IN THIS CASE WE'RE BLENDING THE ENDING SOUND
THEN IN THIS CASE I LIKE TO JUST LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND SPLIT IT AGAIN
IN THIS CASE RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT MY PYROMETER AND IT'S INDICATING IT'S HARD TO SEE OF COURSE BUT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT THAT'S ABOUT NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE SEVENTY-FIVE FAHRENHEIT
WELL WE'RE HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE
AND THOSE ARE REALLY BASICALLY YOUR LEFT AND RIGHT SOURCES IN THIS CASE TWO TURNTABLES
SO ONE OF THE THINGS NOW IS THAT WE HAVE TO GET IT OFF THE STAND IN THIS CASE THIS IS A PRETTY TYPICAL SAXOPHONE NECK STRAP
WE'RE GOING TO START TALKING NOW ABOUT CASE STYLES
NOW LET'S FOCUS ON THE CASE STYLES NOW SO THAT YOU KNOW BETTER OF WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE LOOKING FOR ANTIQUE CLOCKS
IN THAT CASE YOU ALSO WANT TO DO THE OTHER SIDE AS WELL SO DO BOTH SHOULDER POINTS
IN THE OTHER CASE I HAVE THE FAIRY WHICH IF YOU ALSO MAKE IT SMALLER AND THE LADYBUG MY SMALLEST DESIGN
A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO KEEP THEIR LENSES STORED IN A CASE TO PROTECT THEM INSTEAD OF LEAVING THEM ON THEIR CAMERA BODY BECAUSE THEY'RE EXPENSIVE
I TAKE THE ARMS AND I'LL FOLD THEM INWARD AND I'VE GOT MY HAND IN THERE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO CREATE A BIG CREASE IN THERE WHERE I'M FOLDING I WANT IT TO FOLD STRAIGHT AND FLAT AND AS YOU CAN SEE I'M MAKING A LITTLE BIT OF MARGIN USING HERE'S THE ARMPIT AND THIS WOULD BE YOUR SIDE OR FLANK OF THE SHIRT AND I'M PULLING IT TOWARDS THE MIDDLE THERE AND NOW WHAT I WOULD DO IN THIS CASE WOULD BE TAKE THE TAIL BRING IT UP AGAINST MAKING SURE I'M NOT CREATING NEW CREASES I'D PULL IT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE COLLAR SO THAT THE COLLAR HAS SOMETHING TO PROTECT IT ITS NOT JUST HANGING OUT THERE IN THE BREEZE BY ITSELF
AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THIS IN THIS CASE THIS IS A VERY THIN MATERIAL AND ITS MAKING A NICE FLAT LITTLE PACKAGE AND IT COULD BE DONE JUST LIKE THIS ANOTHER WAY TO DO THIS MIGHT BE TO FOLD IT AGAIN BUT THAT WOULD BE UP TO YOU AND THE SIZE OF THE SPACE YOU HAVE IN YOUR SUITCASE
SO WE'RE GOING TO WRITE THAT DOWN AND INDICATE IT WITH A LOWER CASE ROMAN NUMERAL BECAUSE IT'S MINOR
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I'VE USED THE SAME BASIC TECHNIQUE AS I SHOWED WITH THE STAIN EARLIER THE OVERLAPPING CIRCLES
BUT AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY SEE WITH THIS PRODUCT IT DOESN'T HAVE A TENDENCY TO RAISE THE GRAIN AS MUCH AS THE OIL BASED STAIN AND IN THE CASE I DIDN'T CONDITION THE WOOD AT ALL
SO WHATEVER THE WIDTH OF YOUR BOOK CASE IS GOING TO FINALLY BE THE SHELVES ARE ALWAYS AN INCH AND A HALF LESS THAN THE TOTAL WIDTH OF THE BOOKCASE
AGAIN WITH THE 7TH MAJOR 7TH TONALITY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS SOUND BECAUSE THE 7TH IN THIS CASE WOULD BE G SHARP
IN THIS CASE IT HAPPENS TO BE POINTING RIGHT INTO THE SUN SO IT'S PRETTY EASY TO TELL THAT
IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE IN THAT CASE BUT IT WOULDN'T BE AN EXPERIENCE THAT WE WANT THE PUPPY TO HAVE
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW IN CASE IT BIASED OUR OBSERVATIONS
TAKE YOUR PROP IN CASE YOU NEED IT AND LAY IT DOWN BUT STAND IT UP TO START OFF WITH
NOW THAT'S WHERE THAT BLOCK COMES IN HANDY YOU CAN REST YOUR HAND RIGHT UP ON THE BLOCK YOU CAN LAY THE BLOCK DOWN FOR SECURITY OR YOU CAN TAKE YOUR HAND RIGHT DOWN TO THE FOOT BUT IN ANY CASE YOUR EYES STAY ON THAT LEFT HAND
IN THIS CASE THERE'S ONLY ONE OPTION WHICH IS THE LAGOON CLASSIC
SOME OF THEM ARE JUST BIGGER IN CASE YOU NEED A BIGGER ONE
NOW IN THIS CASE AGAIN I'M JUST USING A SIMPLE PIECE OF SCRAP ONE BY
I THINK I'LL DO SOME MORESO ANOTHER METHOD THAT I DID WAS TO TAKE A PICTURE OF A STATUE IN A GARDEN AND THEN I COVERED THAT WITH CLEAR WAX AND IN THIS CASE I PUT DOWN SOME TISSUE PAPER AND THEN I SHOWED THE THREADS OF THE TISSUE PAPER THROUGH THE WAX AND COLORED ON TOP OF THAT SURFACE TO CREATE THIS EFFECT AND IT HAS AN INTERESTING TRANSITION FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH TO THE WAX COATING
SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IN THAT CASE IS TAKE THE STEM OUT OF THE VASE AND GIVE IT ANOTHER FRESH CUT SO THAT YOU'RE OPENING UP THE BASE OF THE STEM AGAIN AND IT'S DRINKING THE WATER O.K
THEY JUST TAKE THE REST OF THE VENEER OFF STAIN UP THE CASE AND YOU HAVE BASICALLY A PINE STEEPLE CLOCK WHICH MAY LOOK PRETTY BUT DEFINITELY IS NOT DESIRABLE
YOU DON'T WANT A CHILD EVER LEAVING A LOCATION NOT GOING WITH YOU FEARING THAT YOU'VE LEFT WITHOUT THEM ASSURE THEM THAT THAT WILL NEVER EVER BE THE CASE
WHAT I RECOMMEND IS A SINGLE ACTION REEL IN THE CASE OF EACH OF THESE REELS IT'S A SINGLE ACTION WHICH MEANS THAT FOR EVERY REVOLUTION OF THE SPOOL YOU BRING IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF LINE SO THAT ONE TURN LIKE THIS WILL BRING IN ABOUT NINE INCHES OF FLY LINE
BUT SOMETIMES WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT THE DISTANCE OF OUR OPPONENT'S ATTACK WILL BE OR WE JUST NEED MORE DISTANCE TO PROTECT OURSELVES IN THAT CASE WE USE TOO QUICK BUT SHORT RETREATS TO AVOID OUR OPPONENT'S ATTACK
IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO BE USING THE FINE TIPPED SHARPIE WHICH IS GOOD FOR THESE TYPES OF DEMONSTRATIONS CAUSE YOU CAN REALLY SEE THE INK PRETTY WELL BUT I WILL TELL YOU THOUGH IF YOU'RE USING A SKETCH PAD THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF PRECIOUS DRAWINGS ON IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA TO USE SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT LESS POWERFUL BECAUSE THIS WILL BLEED LIKE CRAZY THROUGH THE PAGES
AND IN THIS CASE WE ARE GOING TO LAY OUT A LINE OF WOOL THAT'S GOING TO BECOME OUR FELTED ROPE
IF THAT'S THE CASE YOU MAY NEED TO GO TO MORE WHAT WE CALL A VERSO TYPE COLLAR WHICH IS THIS
I HAVE ONE PIECE I LOVE USING THE CHILDRENS ARTS AND CRAFTS THAT THEY DID IN SCHOOL AND SO YOU'LL SEE THAT THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK CASE I HAVE A FEW OF THE ART PIECES THAT MY CHILD MADE AND BRING IN THOSE FUN PIECES LIKE PIPES AND SPECTACLES AND JUST USE THOSE ALSO BUT MAKE YOUR BOOK CASES INTERESTING ANCHOR THEM AND MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE WEIGHT IN THEM
AND YOU'LL ALSO PROBABLY WANT TO HAVE A COOL BOWL OF COOL WATER NEXT TO IT JUST IN CASE YOU WANT TO COOL THE STONES OFF MORE RAPIDLY
YOU MIGHT ALSO WANT TO HAVE A COOL TOWEL ON HAND IN CASE YOU WANT TO COOL YOUR CLIENTS SKIN OFF
SO WE COUNT SIXTEENTH NOTES ONE-E OR IN THIS CASE TWO-E-AND-A SO WE HAVE TWO-E-AND-A IN THE KICK OKAY
WHICH IN THIS CASE EACH SIDE IS ABOUT EIGHT INCHES
AND IN THIS CASE HERE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE TAIL OFF
JUST IN CASE KIND OF THING
SO IN THIS CASE RIGHT HERE WITH THIS BLUEBERRY PEACH WINE IT'S CLEAR IT'S NOT BUBBLING ANYMORE SO IT'S READY TO TAKE AND BOTTLE
OFTEN CASE A SIMPLE HEAT FIXTURE JUST LIKE THIS A LAMP WITH A CERAMIC TOP ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A CERAMIC TOP AND A TWENTY-FIVE OR A FIFTY WATT BULB USUALLY SEVENTY-FIVE TOPS WILL DO YOU AS FAR AS HEATING GOES
IN THIS CASE AGAIN ONE WILL MAKE ATTACK LOOKING TO HIT THE OTHER WILL EITHER DO COUNTER ATTACK OR MAKE IT SHORT AND TAKE OVER
IN THIS CASE YOU SEE AS SHE'S MAKING HER ATTACK EMMA MAKES HER CUT AND ESCAPES SAFELY AVOIDING THE HIT
ANYTIME YOU HAVE COLUMNS OUT THERE AND THEY'RE THE ONLY COLUMNS REMAINING AND THE VALUE OF ALL THE COLUMNS IN THIS CASE TWO IS THE SAME IN THIS CASE KING
SO IN THIS CASE OUR BAG IS ELEVEN INCHES WIDE AND WE WANT TO HAVE A LITTLE EXTRA
SO IN CASE YOU'D LIKE TO BUY A SECOND CLASS TICKET YOU CAN SAVE MONEY ON YOUR WAY TO BERLIN
AND OF COURSE LIKE SOMETIMES BE THE CASE DEPENDING ON THE BLEND AT SELF THE DISTINCT DIFFERENCE BEING OF COURSE A SINGLE MALT IS BLENDED FROM ONE SOURCE OF BARLEY AND A BLENDED WHISKEY ARE COMING FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MALT WHISKEYS THEMSELVES
IN THIS CASE WE'VE GOT FOURTEEN TWENTY WHICH IS JUST RIGHT FOR THIS PARTICULAR GLAZE
SO YOU KNOW IF THAT WERE THE CASE YOU KNOW YOU'D CUT THIS GUY OUT AND YOU'D AGAIN USING YOUR MEDIA AND STICK IT DOWN MAYBE ABOVE HERE'S THE PROBLEM
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE ABLE TO USE TEXT AND WORDING THAT BECOMES A VERY BIG DEAL SO MAKE SURE AND WATCH OUT FOR THAT IN CASE YOU WANT TO TRANSFER ANY WORDS ONTO YOUR PIECE OF WOOD
IN THIS CASE IT'S GOING TO BE RIGHT THERE SO I'M GOING TO TAKE MY PIN TOOL AND SIMPLY MARK IT
IN THIS CASE YOU WOULD JUST PAINT THE EDGES ALSO
YOU CAN SEE IN A CASE LIKE THIS WHERE ON AN EDGE IT'S PRETTY EASY FOR YOUR DUST CLOTH TO CATCH AN EDGE OF VENEER IF IT'S STARTING TO LIFT AND POP OFF
PLACE THAT ON TOP OF THE GARMENT OR THE PILLOW IN THIS CASE AND I'M GOING TO JUST TAKE AND WHIP STITCH
NONE OF THE SHOULDER POINTS ARE PARTICULARLY EASY SO YOU MAY END UP JUST DOING MASSAGE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE
AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE BEST WAY TO PULL IN SPONSORSHIPS AT LEAST IN MY CASE
TO BEGIN YOUR TRAIN ROUTES SIMPLY CLICK ON THE ORIGIN WHICH IS IN THIS CASE IS GOING TO BE A CITY AND IT'S GOING TO BE YUMA TERMINAL
AND THEN ALSO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT I DIDN'T EVEN WASN'T REALLY AWARE ABOUT UNTIL I BOUGHT MY TABLE THE OWNER OF THE SHOP SUGGESTED THAT I GET A CARRYING CASE WHICH I NEVER EVEN HEARD OF BEFORE
BUT A CARRYING CASE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS BECAUSE THAT CASE IS GOING TO KEEP YOUR ABILITY TO MAKE A LIVING
NOW IN THIS CASE THIS CREATURE HAS FLYING MEANS IT CAN ONLY BE BLOCKED BY CREATURES WITH FLYING AND/OR REACH AND IT ALSO HAS WHEN MARSH FLITTER COMES INTO THE PLAY PUT TWO 1/1 BLACK GOBLIN ROGUE CREATURE TOKENS INTO PLAY
IN THIS CASE EMMA BEGINS PREPARING HER ATTACK AND AS SHE DOES SHE IS HIT IN THE HEAD
THIS SHOWS THAT IN CASE OF EMERGENCY YOU ARE PROPERLY TRAINED TO ASSIST THEIR CHILD
IN THIS CASE WE'RE GOING TO USE THE SECOND FRET OF THE A STRING THE FOURTH FRET OH WE WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT MIDDLE ONE BECAUSE IT'S AN OCTAVE
SO THE ACCIDENTAL ON THE F SHARP WOULD NORMALLY MAKE THIS AN F SHARP BUT SINCE IN THIS CASE WE DON'T WANT THIS TO BE SHARP WE HAVE TO USE THE NATURAL SIGN TO REDUCE THIS BACK TO REGULAR F WE HAVE F F SHARP AND F NATURAL
SO IN THIS CASE WHAT I'M AFTER IS A P THAT I WANT TO PUT RIGHT HERE SO THAT I END UP WITH PLACING AND SPACING
IT GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF AND THEN I WONDER WHERE THAT LITTLE THOUGHT TAKES ME AND IN THIS CASE IT GOT ME THINKING ABOUT HOW COULD I MULTIPLY THE TOOLS THAT I HAVE TO MAKE MANY MORE TOOLS OUT OF THE ONE TOOL
THIS TERMINAL MIGHT STAY CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IF YOU DON'T BEND IT OUT OF THE WAY A LITTLE IN WHICH CASE WE MIGHT STILL HAVE THE SPARKING PROBLEM
IN THIS CASE WE COULD BE PLAYING THE SAME STRINGS
SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO GRAB THESE ARE GOLF SHOES ACTUALLY THESE ARE NOT PAINTBALL SHOES BUT YOU COULD REPLACE ALL THESE LITTLE SPIKES SO IN CASE THEY WORE OUT OR ANYTHING LIKE THEY WOULD FIT PERFECT
ONE THING I WOULD SUGGEST DOING THOUGH UNLESS YOU'RE JUST AN ENGINE FANATIC THE ENGINE PORTION WHICH USUALLY REST UNDERNEATH THE SEAT MAKE IT AS VAGUE AND AMBIGUOUS AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT UNLESS YOU'RE TRYING TO DESIGN THE LOOK OF AN ENGINE IN WHICH CASE I SAY GO NUTS BUT UNLESS THAT'S YOUR OBJECTIVE DO NOT GO INTO MUCH DETAIL WITH THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL BE SO DISTRACTED BY WHAT IT IS THEY WON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO LOOK AT HONESTLY THEY'LL BE VERY VERY CONFUSED BY IT
BUT IT GETS THE TEMPERATURE HIGH ENOUGH IN THE CASE OF THE EFFETRE ITALIAN GLASS WE'RE USING NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT GETS THE GLASS HOT ENOUGH SO THAT THE MOLECULES IN THE BEAD FORM GET TO VIBRATE AND KIND OF MOVE A LITTLE BIT
NOW MAY BE THAT'S NOT AS COMMON THESE DAYS BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF CAMCORDERS AROUND BUT YOU CAN GO INTO YOUR MENU GO DOWN IN THIS CASE TO RECORD LAMP AND CHANGE THE STATE OF IT TO OFF AND THEN CHANGE IT BACK TO ON AND SO THAT WAY YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND RECORD WITHOUT PEOPLE KNOWING IF YOU ARE OR ARE NOT
IN MY CASE I DREW THE NINE OF SPADES FROM THE STOCK PILE
THE OVER GRIP GIVES YOU PROTECTION BECAUSE IN CASE YOU'RE PLAYING A MATCH AND YOU'RE OVER GRIP IS GETTING REALLY BAD YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE IT OUT AND THEN HAVE YOUR UNDER GRIP THERE AND READY TO PLAY AGAIN
THE OTHER THING WE CAN DO IS THE TRIM ON THE BACK WHERE THE BASS WAS PLUGGED IN TO GO AHEAD AND JUST BRING THAT BACK DOWN TO NOTHING JUST IN CASE WHEN YOU GO TO DO SOMETHING ELSE LATER YOU DON'T HAVE A HIGH LEVEL DAMAGE YOUR EARS OR SOMETHING
SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT I HAVE USED ARE THE TRADITIONAL TEXT BOOKS OF COURSE AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE STANDARDS TO HELP GUIDE THE CURRICULUMS ESPECIALLY IF A CURRICULUM IS NOT SET WHICH IS THE CASE IN A LOT OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT I SEE
THEN THERE IS A COUNTRY CODE IN THIS CASE FOR SWITZERLAND 41
I'VE STARTED BY DRILLING SOME PILOT HOLES YOU CAN SEE I'VE DRILLED SOME PILOT HOLES INTO THE CASE HERE
IN THIS CASE WHEN IT SAYS HALF WE'RE GOING TO BE BENDING UP A HALF STEP
THEY'RE GOING TO KIND OF CREATE SOME PARALLELS BETWEEN THE INSECT WORLD AND IN THIS CASE THE RHINO WORLD
IN CASE YOU ARE USING PREPAID PHONES YOU HAVE TO BE CERTAIN YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT CREDIT
I AM A DECORATOR AND I LOVE DOING UNPREDICTABLE THINGS BUT I REALLY LIKE THE WEIGHT OF BOOKS IN A BOOK CASE SO A LOT OF THE TIPS THAT I WILL SHOW YOU AS FAR AS WORKING WITH BOOK CASES WE'LL BE USING BOOKS WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS NO MATTER HOW DEEP YOUR BOOK CASE IS I LIKE TO BRING THE BOOKS FORWARD SO IT LOOKS REALLY FULL AND I USUALLY BRING THE BOOKS FORWARD TO RIGHT TO THE EDGE OF THE SHELF AND THEN I LIKE USING LIKE SIZES
NOW A LOT OF TIMES WHAT PEOPLE WILL DO IS THEY'LL PUT A LOT OF LITTLE ACCESSORIES IN A BOOK CASE WHICH REALLY GETS LOST AND SO YOU REALLY NEED IF YOU ARE GOING TO DECORATE WITH ACCESSORIES YOU NEED TO DO ONE BIG PIECE SO WE HAVE BOOKS AND ONE BIG PIECE
THE BIG CASE INVOLVES A YOUNG GIRL WHO IS A KEY WITNESS
BUT ON YOUR WAY DON'T FORGET TO TAKE SOMETHING TO READ WITH YOU AND OF COURSE REFRESHMENTS IN CASE THE DINING CAR IS NOT OPEN
IN THIS CASE WE'VE ALREADY INSTALLED THE SOFTWARE
HE IS GOING TO RE-TEE THE BALL AND HIT A PROVISIONAL JUST IN CASE WE CAN'T FIND THE FIRST ONE THAT HE HIT INTO THE WOODS
YOU ALSO WANT TO HAVE TWIG ON HAND JUST IN CASE YOUR HORSE DOES NOT WANT TO BE CLIPPED
JUST IN CASE YOUR ROLLS ARE A LITTLE LONGER THAN THE ONE'S WE'VE USED
I REALLY LOVE BOOKS IN A BOOK CASE
SO IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE'RE GOING TO BE USING BAKING SODA SALT AND CLEAR VINEGAR
SIMPLY GOING TO REMOVE THE DIPSTICK GOING TO TAKE A RAG AND I'M GOING TO WIPE IT AND I DO NOT HAVE TO THREAD THE DIPSTICK BACK INTO THIS ENGINE CASE
IN THIS CASE I'M DOING A FORWARD SWEEP
BUT IN THIS CASE BECAUSE WE GOT THAT BACON FAT IN THERE WE ARE REALLY JUST GOING TO COOK IT FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES AND KEEP STIRRING IT AND I DON'T WON'T TO BURN IT AT ALL OR HAVE IT TAKE ANY COLOR BECAUSE I'VE GOTTEN A LITTLE BIT OF COLOR FROM OUR BACON TO BEGIN WITH AND I LIKE MY COLOR TO BE AS WHITE AS IT CAN BE
IN THIS CASE WE'RE PLAYING WITH AN OPEN HAND
IN THIS POKEMON'S CASE I ACTUALLY HAVE A RESISTANCE TO METAL OF THIRTY
THIS IS ANN MYRICK AND THAT IS HOW TO DECORATE A BOOK CASE
BASICALLY WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IN A CASE LIKE THIS AND THIS IS NOT A JOB FOR THE HOME AMATEUR TO DO WOULD BE TO REMOVE ALL THE FRETS SAND THE FRETBOARD LEVEL PUT THE FRETS BACK IN
HI I'M ANN MYRICK AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT DECORATING YOUR BOOK CASE
YOUR SAKES ARE INCREDIBLE FRESH TODAY AND THAT WASN'T ALWAYS THE CASE
SO IN THIS CASE THE SEVEN OF SPADES THEY WILL START THE BETTING
I THINK THE CLIENT MY BOARD IN THIS CASE WILL BE PRETTY IMPRESSED
YOU WANT TO BE AS LOW AS POSSIBLE IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO USE ISO ONE HUNDRED
BACK BEFORE 1975 MOST OF THE TOURNAMENTS REQUIRED YOU TO WEAR WHITE SHORTS OR WHITE SHIRTS BUT THAT'S NO LONGER THE CASE
SOMETHING THAT'S JUST GOING TO GET IN THE GROUND AND HOLD YOUR TENT DOWN IN CASE THERE'S STRONG WINDS OR RAIN ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR RAIN FLOWING
UNFORTUNATELY LOTS OF FOLKS HAVE THE FEELING THAT IF THEY PUT A CAT OUT THE FRONT DOOR AND THEIR BIRD FEEDERS ARE IN THE BACKYARD THERE WON'T BE A CONFLICT WELL UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT THE CASE
SO IN ORDER TO GIVE YOU A MARKER TO RELATE THAT TO I'M GOING TO PUT A LOWER CASE I IN HERE
YOU CAN SEE IT'S HANGING FROM THE LOWER CASE HEIGHT MARK THE X HEIGHT
NOW IN THIS CASE IT'S JUST THE ROCKERS
NOW IF YOU COULD GO OUT AND YARD SALES YOU CAN FIND WHAT WE CALL SOME DIAMONDS IN THE ROUGH AND THIS PARTICULAR CASE THIS IS A PERIOD PIECE THAT IS A WIDE BODY ROCKER AND THESE ARE REALLY HARD TO COME BY YOU DON'T SEE A WHOLE OF THESE OUT THERE THEY ARE VERY RARE
JUST IN CASE EVERYTHING OF YOURS FALLS INTO THE ATLANTIC THEN YOU'VE GOT A BACKUP
AND TEK OR BEK IN THIS CASE WHEN YOU ARE HITTING THE EDGE OF THE RIM EDGE OF THE SKIN YOU ARE GETTING THAT VERY CRISP SOUND
IF THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT HAPPY SHOPPING THE GROCERY STORE HAS TONS OF STUFF TO CHOOSE FROM
I HAVE A BETTER ONE THAT I KEEP IN MY CASE THAT HAS STIFFER SPRINGS
THIS IS HOW TO ADAPT TO YOUR SURROUNDINGS IN CASE YOU HAVE TO SURVIVE IN NATURE
STARTING OUT SLOW AND THEN WE WILL INCREASE THE SPEED AND WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF ROOM TO WORK WITH SO WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO ILLUSTRATE IS HE IS GOING TO MOVE AROUND ACTUALLY IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO MOVE AROUND AND HE IS GOING TO FOLLOW ME AROUND AND TRY AND MAINTAIN THIS POSITION
THIS IS CALLED THE FOLLOW THE LEADER DRILL TYPICALLY IN FIGHTING YOU DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW THE LEADER YOU WANT TO ESTABLISH YOUR OWN FORM OF PLAN BUT IN THIS CASE HERE IS HOW THE DRILL WORKS
IN THIS CASE IF I FLIPPED OVER AT THIS MOMENT WHICH I'M NOT GOING TO DO RIGHT AWAY
BUT IF YOU WANT TO KEEP IT SORT OF MATCHING YOU CAN DO A NEUTRAL COLOR IN CASE ANY OF THE THREAD SHOWS
A TYPICAL DAY OF A MOVIE ACTOR IT MEANS GETTING UP VERY EARLY GOING TO THE SET GETTING MADE UP HOPEFULLY NOT AFTER UNTIL YOU GET A CUP OF COFFEE AND SITTING IN A MAKE UP CHAIR AND GETTING YOUR FACE POWDERED AND YOUR LITTLE THINGS WIPED OUT OF YOUR EYES THAT HAVE ACCUMULATED THERE OVERNIGHT SOMETIMES IT'S RATHER EMBARRASSING AND THEN YOU GO TO THE HAIR DEPARTMENT AND THEY OF COURSE ADJUST YOUR HAIR OR IN MY CASE THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT TO DO SO I'M PRETTY MUCH JUST MAKE UP AND OUT THE DOOR
IN CASE YOU ARE MAKING LARGER CUTS YOU CAN COME ALL THE WAY OUT SAY 25 1/2 INCH RIP CUTS AS LONG AS THE BOARD COMES EIGHT TEN TWELVE FEET LONG
SO IN ONE DAY I MIGHT BE IN THE CLINIC IN THE MORNING SEEING A VERY COMPLICATED INFECTIOUS DISEASE CASE AND THEN I'M ACTUALLY TRAINING PHYSICIANS IN TRAINING
IF NOTHING ELSE YOU CAN USE A SPARE TIRE FROM THE VEHICLE AND SLIDE THAT UNDERNEATH THE CAR AS A SAFETY BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING UNDERNEATH THERE TO CONTAIN THE CAR IN CASE THE JACK FAILS
SO THAT IN CASE THE JACK FAILS THE CAR IS NOT GOING TO FALL TO THE GROUND POSSIBLY INJURE YOU AND OR DAMAGE YOUR VEHICLE
IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO BE TWISTING IT TWISTING THE CAMERA ON THE LENS ONTO THE CAMERA CLOCKWISE
IN THIS CASE I HAVE AN L LENS WHICH HAS A RED DOT ON THE LENS AND THERE'S A RED DOT ON THE BODY
SO OUR NEXT STEP IS TO ADD TEH FLAVORING LIQUID AND IN THIS CASE I AM GOING TO USE CLAM JUICE
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE CREAM AND IN THIS CASE WE ARE GOING TO USE MILK BECAUSE I LIKE IT TO BE A LITTLE BIT THINNER
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE THE SAME RESIDENT QUALITY AS THAT FUNDAMENTAL THAT WE'VE HAD ALL ALONG BUT IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO START WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL ONE
THEN THERE'S ADDING ON COLOR SHAPE SHADOW SO IN THIS CASE LET'S HAVE THE SHADOW GO ALL AROUND THE BODY SO BRING IT UP OVER HERE ON THE PAWS
SO IN THIS CASE WE WANT OUR BRACKETS AND OUR ROD TO BE JUST A FEW INCHES LONGER THAN THAT OPENING
AND THEN TO MEASURE THE WIDTH OF THE CURTAIN ROD IN THIS CASE SINCE THIS IS A SHEER WE WANT TO BE JUST A LITTLE BIT WIDER SO WE'LL MEASURE OUR OPENING AND YOU WANT TO GO INSIDE DIMENSIONS TO INSIDE DIMENSIONS WE GOT THIRTY-FIVE
SO IN THIS CASE WHEN I MEASURE UP WE'VE GOT ABOUT EIGHTY-FOUR INCHES SO THE ACTUAL CURTAIN LENGTH WOULD BE ABOUT EIGHTY-FOUR AND A HALF SO THAT EXTRA HALF AN INCH IS GOING TO ALLOW US THAT CURTAIN
HI THIS IS JOHN STEWART AND THIS IS HOW TO ACCESS THE SURROUNDING AREAS IN CASE YOU HAVE TO SURVIVE IN NATURE
NOW IF YOU REMEMBER FROM BALL JUGGLING A MULTIPLEX IS WHEN YOU THROW MORE THAN ONE BALL AT ONCE OR IN OUR CASE MORE THAN ONE CLUB AT ONCE
IT HAS THIS GIANT PADLOCK WHICH IS VERY COOL BUT IN THIS CASE IT DOESN'T COMPLEMENT THE OUTFIT NICELY
WORKING THE WAY FROM THE BOTTOMS UP IN WHICH CASE I'LL START WITH THE CALVES
IF THEY ARE HAVING TROUBLE COMPLETING THEIR NORMAL DAILY ACTIVITIES VIA THEIR HOME THEIR WORK WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE WE START TO SEE A RETURN TO MORE NORMAL FUNCTION SO THAT DAILY ACTIVITY IS NOT SO MUCH OF A CHORE AND THERE IS NO LIMITATIONS TO DOING THOSE THINGS
IN MY CASE I'M GETTING SOME GOOD CRACKS GOING RIGHT NOW
I ALWAYS LIKE TO MAKE PHOTOCOPIES OF MY CARDS THE FRONT IN THE BACK JUST IN CASE
IN THIS CASE YOU CAN TAKE A MULLIGAN SHUFFLE WHICH MEANS YOU PUT THE CARDS BACK IN THE DECK RESHUFFLE THE DECK
BUT TRADITIONAL YAHAMAHAI AND TRADITIONAL KIMOTO METHOD WHICH IS A POLE RAM METHOD WHERE THEY USED TO LITERALLY BEAT PULVERIZE IN A TUB USING LONG PADDLES THIS RICE STEAMED RICE TO TRY TO PROMOTE LACTIC ACID WHICH THEY DIDN'T KNOW REALLY KIND OF OCCURRED BY ITSELF IN ANY CASE
NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO SAFETY BETWEEN THE IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO BE THE ATTACKER AND SHAUN MY ASSISTANT HERE HE'S GOING TO BE THE ATTACKEE
IN THIS CASE PUT IT INTO YOUR CAMERA WHICH WILL THEN SEND IT RIGHT BACK OUT
BUT IF THAT IS NOT THE CASE YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH TUG AS LONG AS YOU SET UP RULES
AND IF YOU'RE A SAXOPHONE PLAYER I WOULD JUST PROBABLY KEEP THESE IN YOUR CASE BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS A DESIGN FLAW ON A SAXOPHONE WHICH THEY HAVE NOW REPAIRED WITH SOME NEWER MODELS OF CERTAIN SAXOPHONES
IF SHE'S THIRSTY SHE'LL DRINK BUT IN THIS CASE SHE'S NOT
IN THIS CASE WE'RE GOING TO SEE IF WE CAN GET POSSUM TO GO DRINK HER WATER
IN THE CASE OF OUR LITTLE FOUR PATCH THAT WE DID HERE ITS THIRTEEN X 25
BUT IN THE CASE OF MY SMALL PIECE I HAVE HERE I HAVE ONE SIDE THAT IS THIRTEEN INCHES AND ONE SIDE THAT IS 25 INCHES
SO IF YOU JUST WANT TO REFRESH YOUR SINGERS YOU CAN JUST DO THAT AND REFRESH IT AND CHANGE IT TO WHATEVER YOU FEEL MIGHT BE THE CASE
SO I WENT AND DID SOME LIFE DRAWING CLASSES TO SEE WHAT I COULD COME UP WITH AND I TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE MODELS AND IN THIS CASE HERE I STARTED WITH THIS ONE ACTUALLY
IN THIS CASE I TOOK THE MAN AND I HAD HIM PRINTED ON SILK AND I WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT TO DO WITH HIM AND I HAD SOME WAX ON A CARD THAT WAS LAYING ON THE TABLE AND WHEN I DRAPED THIS PIECE OF SILK ON TOP OF IT I COULD SEE THROUGH TO THE WAX AND JUST BY HEATING THE TOP OF THE SURFACE THE WAX CAME THROUGH AND I CALLED HIM TATTOO
IN CASE YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT WORKS AT THE COMPUTER ALL THE TIME MAYBE DRIVES ALL THE TIME MAYBE YOU DO GARDENING MAYBE YOU'RE A MUSICIAN ANYTHING THAT YOU DO REPETITIVELY OVER AND OVER CAN CAUSE YOU TO HAVE CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME
THIS CASE IS METAL
THIS WILL INSURE THAT MY REPEL DEVICE DOES NOT COME OFF THE END OF THE ROPE IN CASE THE ROPE DOESN'T HIT THE GROUND
UNDER OS TYPE JUST CHOOSE LINUX AND THERE'S EVEN AN UBUNTU SETTING LET'S GO WITH UBUNTU FOR THIS CASE AND JUST SAY NEXT
