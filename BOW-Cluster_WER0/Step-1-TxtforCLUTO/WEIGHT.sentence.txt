FOR WEIGHT DISPLACEMENT YOU SHOULD LEAN BACK JUST A LITTLE BIT
TWO REASONS ONE YOU CAN BALANCE YOUR WEIGHT IF YOUR CHEST IS OVER YOUR FEET
I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU WEIGHT DISPLACEMENT
RIGHT HERE IS YOUR LOWER CONTROL ARM AND IT BEARS MOST OF THE WEIGHT FOR THE SUSPENSION ITS MADE OF A HEAVY GAGE STAMPED METAL AND ITS STURDY ENOUGH TO HOLD THE VEHICLE UP
YOU'RE GOING TO PRESS YOUR WEIGHT INTO YOUR ELBOWS ROLL YOUR SHOULDERS BACK INHALE AND OPEN THROUGH YOUR HEART
SO AGAIN WE'LL BEND THE FRONT KNEE FOR WARRIOR ONE LEAN SLIGHTLY FORWARD STEP THE BACK IN FIND ALL THE WEIGHT ON THE FRONT LEG EXTEND BEND THE FRONT KNEE STEP BACK PLACE BOTH HANDS ON THE FLOOR AND AGAIN STRAIGHTEN THE FRONT LEG
SOME TABLETS HAVE ONLY NINETY POUND WEIGHT PAPER
NOW IF YOU'RE USING ALL THOSE VARIED RHYTHMS YOU CAN ESSENTIALLY DO THAT FOR FOUR MINUTES OR IF YOU LIKE TO COUNT YOU CAN DO THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT THAT IT TAKES FOR YOU TO DO TEN TO FIFTEEN REPS THREE SETS
WHEN IT GRABS IT WILL GRIP BUT AS YOU LOOSEN YOUR BODY WEIGHT OFF OF IT ON YOUR OTHER LINE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SLIDE THIS DOWN AND KEEP USING THIS LINE
ON OUR CLIENT TODAY I SEE A LITTLE BIT OF DRYNESS SO TODAY I'M GOING TO CHOOSE SKIN SMOOTHING CREAM A NICE MEDIUM WEIGHT MOISTURIZER
WHAT THEY DO IS THEY DO THE SAME TYPES OF MOVEMENTS BUT DUE TO THE WEIGHT BEING A LITTLE BIT HEAVIER ON ONE END IT MAKES YOUR FLOWERS AND THE DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES A LOT FASTER AND THOSE ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STAFFS
YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME WITH ABOUT A MEDIUM WEIGHT JUST ONLY REALLY A FEW OUNCES
IF YOU GOT SOME THAT WON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TYPE OF WEIGHT THEY'LL BE TOO HEAVY OR TOO LIGHT
SOME THAT GIVE THEM LIGHTER WEIGHT HOWEVER ARE ALL VERY DURABLE
YOU WANT MOST OF THE WEIGHT TO BE ON YOUR HIPS EVEN IF IT IS JUST A BACKPACK LIKE THIS
IF YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THIS THE WAY I HAVE BEEN TELLING YOU YOU PROBABLY ARE ALREADY GETTING FAMILIAR WITH WHERE YOUR WEIGHT IS SUPPOSE TO GO
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HYDRATE FOR YOUR CELLS YOUR BRAIN FUNCTION AND DETOXIFYING YOUR BODY AND LOSING THE WEIGHT
THE WAY IT LOOKS WITH AN OPPONENT AS THEY THROW THEIR REVERSE PUNCH YOU ARE GOING TO BLOCK WITH THE PALM TWIST THE WEIGHT PICK THE FIST UP AND JUST DRIVE IT STRAIGHT ALONG THE ARM AND HIT SQUARE IN THE FACE ONE TWO JUST LIKE THAT
DOUBLE WRIST GRAB IF YOU CAN STRUGGLE WITH THE GUY CAN'T GET AWAY BOOM SURPRISE HIM COME IN WITH THAT HEADBUTT BREAK HIS NOSE KNEE TO HIS CROTCH TO THE GROIN GO DOWN DROP YOUR WEIGHT BRING UP RIGHT HERE GRAB UNDERNEATH THUMB TO THE BACK OF THE HAND FOUR FINGERS HERE FOR POWER AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO ROLL OR GRAB IT'S UP TO YOU ON TOP STEP BACK WITH YOUR LEFT LEG FOR POWER IN A CIRCLE BOOM HE'S RIGHT THERE I COULD HAVE BROKEN HIS WRIST RIGHT HERE IN A CONTROL POSITION OF DROPS AND PUNCHES
NOW IF YOU'RE SWINGING YOUR BODY YOU'VE GOT TOO MUCH WEIGHT
THAT'S A LOT OF WEIGHT
KEEP YOUR WEIGHT OVER THE FOOT AND NOT THE HAND
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE PART OF THE STICK THAT'S STICKING OUT SHOULD BE BOTH OF THEM SHOULD BE EVEN SO THAT THE FRAME STANDS STRAIGHT UP AND BY THE WEIGHT OF THE BORDER THE THICKNESS OF THE CORRUGATED PAPER AND ALSO THE STICKS THAT ARE INSIDE THIS WILL CREATE A NICE STRONG STURDY SUPPORT TO LET THE BORDER STAND UP STRAIGHT ONTO THE BASE OF THE STAGE
I CAN CONTROL THAT ANGLE BY MOVING MY WEIGHT FORWARD EVEN MORE FORWARD SO IT ANGLES THE OTHER DIRECTION
THIS IS YOUR STANDARD FULL FACE HELMET IT IS SNELL APPROVED IT IS A COMPOSITE BLEND IT HAS A WONDERFUL VENTILATION SYSTEM IT IS VERY LIGHT IN WEIGHT AS YOU CAN SEE IT COVERS THE WHOLE HEAD
THE WEIGHT HERE I SHOULD BRING MY WEIGHT FORWARD TO THIS KNEE SO THAT MY KNEE AND MY ANKLE ARE RIGHT ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER
TURN NOW WEIGHT IS HERE ANKLE AND KNEE THIS LEG IS SLIDING BEHIND
IT ACTS AS BOTH A WEIGHT AND A MEANS OF GETTING ATTENTION BY FLASHING AT THE FISH
ADJUST WITH YOUR WEIGHT AND THEN OLLIE OUT OR COAST OUT OF THE MANUAL
YOU DON'T WANT TO PACK THINGS THAT YOU DON'T NEED IT'S JUST EXTRA WEIGHT
THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS YOU GRAB THE ARM WITH BOTH OF YOUR ARMS AND YOU DROP YOUR WEIGHT DOWN INTO THE HORSE STANCE RIGHT AWAY IT FORCES THE PERSON DOWN AND THAT IS A HARD POSITION FOR THEM TO MAINTAIN THEIR HOLD
FIRST THING GRAB THE ARMS SECOND YOU DROP YOUR WEIGHT INTO A HORSE STANCE WHICH FORCES THE PERSON DOWN THEN YOU GO INTO SOME STRIKES ELBOWS KICK THE KNEE TURN BRING THE KNEE UP TO THE ELBOW AND STRIKE BEHIND THE KNEE
AND THEN PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR NOSE AND LET THE BACK WHEELS PICK UP PAST THE COPING AND CLEAR IT COMPLETELY AND THEN ROLL DOWN THE TRANSITION
BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IS BE ABLE TO PUT WEIGHT ON THE FRONT OF YOUR BOARD OR YOUR NOSE AND ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PURPOSEFULLY PICK UP THE BACK WHEELS AND CLEAR THE COPING AND BE ABLE TO ROLL BACK DOWN THE TRANSITION AND HAVE CONTROL
ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS FOR WEIGHT TRAINING FOR WOMAN IS TO FIGHT DISEASES SUCH AS OSTEOPOROSIS AND OSTEOARTHRITIS WHICH ARE VERY COMMON IN WOMAN THE OLDER THEY GET THE MORE PRONE THEY ARE TO IT
AND TODAY WE ARE HERE TO DISCUSS WEIGHT TRAINING FOR WOMAN
AND YOU'RE GOING TO SLOWLY EXHALE KEEPING YOUR HEAD BACK AND YOU'RE GOING TO BED PRIMARILY AT THE WAIST TAKING THE WEIGHT DOWN TOWARDS YOUR SHINS
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR FEET ARE EVENLY ON THE SIDES OF YOUR MATS AND YOUR WEIGHT IS DISTRIBUTED EVENLY
INJURIES REALLY IMPORTANT ALSO TO BE IN A PROGRAM A WEIGHT TRAINING PROGRAM TO AVOID THOSE INJURIES
YOU WANT TO COME UP BACKWARDS RIGHT BEFORE YOU GET TO THE BAR YOU WANT TO PUT ALL OF YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR BACK FOOT SLAMMING THE TAIL INTO THE PLATFORM YOUR WHEELS AND TRUCKS INTO THE COPING GIVING YOU THIS LOCKED IN POSITION AND IT SHOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WHEN YOU DO IT PROPERLY
SO REALLY GETTING LOW AND STAYING LOW AND TRYING TO FORCE YOUR BODY WEIGHT DOWN TO THE WHEELS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN MAKES A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE IN HOW STABLE YOU RIDE AND HOW SUCCESSFUL YOU ARE WHEN YOU ARE TRYING
THE BIG THING YOU ARE GOING FOR CHROMATICALLY IN WEIGH DISTRIBUTION WISE ON A MOUNTAIN BIKE IS HAVING WEIGHT EVENLY DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN YOUR TWO WHEELS AND DOING THAT IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS YOU TO CONTROL WHAT YOU ARE DOING
THE MAJOR THING I KEEP COMING BACK TO OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN I AM TALKING ABOUT DISTRIBUTING THE WEIGHT IS SORT OF THINK ON THE ATTACK POSITION WHICH IS JUST LIKE IN SKIING WHERE LIKE PARALLEL SHOULDERS SQUARE OFF TO THE HILL WHAT YOU ARE GOING FOR CHROMATICALLY
I CAN DROP MY CHEST A LITTLE BIT MORE TO PUT MORE WEIGHT ON THAT FRONT WHEEL WHICH IS IMPORTANT ANY TIME YOU WANT TO SLOW DOWN BECAUSE MOST OF YOUR BRAKING IS COMING FROM YOUR FRONT BRAKE AND IT IS IMPORTANT ANY TIME YOU JUST NEED TO BE MORE STABLE
NOW MY WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION IS ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT ON THE REAR WHEEL SITTING HERE FORTY PERCENT ON THE FRONT WHEEL
SO IT IS ALL ABOUT WEIGHT SHIFTING JUST LIKE THE OTHER CARS BUT UNLIKE THE OTHER CARS YOU CAN JUST STAND ON THE GAS AND THE CAR WILL JUST KIND OF GLIDE THROUGH THE CORNERS
IF YOU'VE EVER EMBARKED UPON A PROFESSIONALLY RUN WEIGHT LOSS OR EXERCISE PROGRAM IT'S MOST LIKELY THE FIRST THING THAT YOU WERE TOLD YOU NEEDED TO GET WAS A HEART RATE MONITOR
I THINK THAT JUST FOR THE LAYMAN A HEART RATE MONITOR IS NOT SUCH A TERRIBLE THING TO HAVE AS IT CAN HELP MAKE YOUR OWN WORKOUT AND WEIGHT LOSS EFFORTS MORE EFFICIENT WHETHER YOU'RE PART OF A PROFESSIONAL PROGRAM OR NOT
IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO LOOK YOUNGER MORE FASHIONABLE HEALTHIER AND LOSE WEIGHT
THIS IS RACHAEL RICHARDSON AND THIS HAS BEEN HOW TO BECOME HEALTHIER MORE FASHIONABLE YOUNGER AND LOSE WEIGHT
THIS ONE HERE IS DESIGNED FOR A LARGER PERSON YOU CAN SEE THAT IT IS MADE TO SUPPORT BIGGER WEIGHT BIGGER PERSON THESE ARE ALL FRONT ZIPS
YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR BACK FOOT HOP AND THAT'S IT
MY WEIGHT IS IN THE CENTER RIGHT AND MY HANDS ARE UP
AND SHE HAS SHE CARRIES HER WEIGHT HERE IN THE CENTER
I'M CAROL ANN WITH STUDIO GROUP X AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO A ONE ARM ROW USING YOUR WEIGHT PLATE
THE THIGHS ARE TAKING THE MAJORITY OF THE WEIGHT AND THE MUSCULATURE IS HOLDING YOU UP
I COULD PROBABLY SLIDE A SMALL PIECE OF PAPER UNDERNEATH MY HEELS RIGHT NOW EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE MY WEIGHT IS BACK
WE ARE GOING TO START THE POSITION OPTIONAL WITH A WEIGHT
OR YOU CAN DO A MEDICINE BALL AND NO WEIGHT AT ALL
MY WEIGHT IS AN EIGHT POUND WEIGHT I'M GOING TO TWIST INTO IT
TILL YOU GET AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN FAR AWAY FROM THE LIP YOUR WEIGHT WILL KIND OF GET BACK THIS WAY AND LEAN YOUR BODY WEIGHT OUT TOWARDS THE RAMP
ONCE YOU CLEAR THE LIP LET GO OF YOUR BRAKE WHILE FEATHERING IT USING YOUR WEIGHT AS BALANCE MOVE IT ALL THE WAY BACK
I PUT ALL MY BODY WEIGHT INTO THAT AND I TRY TO TRANSFER IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE HEEL OF MY LEFT HAND
THE WEIGHT IS IN THE WOOD BUT IT'S ALSO THEY ALSO PUT LEAD IN HERE SOMETIMES OR A METAL TO WEIGH IT DOWN TO MAKE A NICE HEAVY SOUND
STEP FIVE INSTEAD OF STEPPING BACK HERE WE'RE GOING TO LEAN ONTO OUR LEFT HAND THROW ALL OUR BODY WEIGHT HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO KICK OUT WITH OUR LEFT LEG
IT'S IMPORTANT TO START SEEING THEM AND SENSING THEM AS A REAL WEIGHT
NOW THIS HAS NO WEIGHT TO IT SO YOU CAN GET THIS ALMOST ANYWHERE AND IT'S A NICE SIZE AS WELL
IF YOU ARE AN ADVANCED EXERCISER TWO SETS OF TWELVE AND THEN LATER ON TWO SETS OF TWENTY AND THEN YOU INCREASE THE REPS AND THEN INCREASE THE WEIGHT AS YOU MOVE ON
SINK THE WEIGHT INTO YOUR HIPS MORE WEIGHT ON THE RIGHT FOOT THEN THE LEFT
NOW THE ONE THAT I HAVE CHOSEN IS FROM ARMANI WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT HAS A LITTLE BIT OF 24 KARAT GOLD IN IT WHICH IS A FIRMING AGENT BUT IT IS A LIGHT WEIGHT GEL
THE FIRST TWO MAJOR FACTORS HEIGHT AND WEIGHT OF THE PERSON THAT'S GOING TO BE USING GOING TO BE THE PRIMARY USER OF THE TREADMILL IS PROBABLY OUR FIRST CONSIDERATION
WE NEED TO LOOK FOR A TREADMILL THAT'S GOING TO SUPPORT THAT PERSON BOTH IN HEIGHT AND WEIGHT
SO WE'RE GOING TO PULL IT BACK AND PUT OUR WEIGHT FRONT
ONCE AGAIN WE ARE GOING TO BALANCE THE WEIGHT ON THE NOSE THIS TIME JUST ENOUGH NOT TO SCRAPE THE NOSE OR TO LET THE BACK WHEELS TOUCH THE GROUND
AND SO WHEN YOU PULL THROUGH YOU PUT ALL YOUR WEIGHT ONTO YOUR LEFT FOOT
SO IF YOU GO PUSHING OFF YOUR LEFT FOOT ALL YOUR WEIGHT IS TRANSFERRING OVER TO THE OTHER FOOT
NOW RELAX ALL OF YOUR WEIGHT IN MY HANDS
KEEP YOUR KNEES BENT AND EQUAL WEIGHT DISTRIBUTED ON EACH KNEE
MAKE SURE THAT YOUR BACK KNEE IS BENT AND YOUR WEIGHT IS DISTRIBUTED OVER YOUR BACK LEG AND YOUR FRONT KNEE IS A LITTLE BIT STRAIGHTENED OUT
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO PUNCH IN YOUR HEIGHT AND YOUR WEIGHT AND THEY'LL FIGURE IT OUT FOR YOU AUTOMATICALLY
SO BASICALLY YOUR BODY MASS INDEX IS FIGURED UP FROM YOUR HEIGHT AND YOUR WEIGHT AND HOW MUCH OF THAT IS BODY FAT
YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE THE WEIGHT BETTER YET YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP IT OFF
SO JUST CALCULATE EXACTLY HOW MUCH WEIGHT IT IS YOU WOULD LIKE TO LOSE AND THEN HOW MANY WEEKS IT WILL TAKE TO LOSE IT
AND THEY USE REALLY TO USE THIS WEIGHT UP HERE THE BLADE WILL BE HEAVY FOR STRIKING
SHE'S GOING TO LIFT WAY UP ON HER TOES AND BRING HER WEIGHT FORWARD CROWN OF THE HEAD FORWARD AND THEN BRING THIS STRAP RIGHT UNDERNEATH AND RIGHT ALONG THE BRA LINE
LET'S PUT OUR WEIGHT ON OUR LEFT FOOT RIGHT FOOT FORWARD
LAST MOVEMENT WE DID WAS LOOKING INTO THE PALM SHIFTING THE WEIGHT ON TO THE LEFT
AS YOU GET READY TO STEP TOWARDS THE RIGHT BOTH HANDS ARE GOING TO FLIP OVER YOU ARE GOING TO STEP AGAIN HEEL TOE SHIFT THE WEIGHT FORWARD ALL THE WAY TO THE RIGHT LEG
WHAT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO WITH BODY BOARDS IS YOUR WEIGHT YOUR HEIGHT AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON THE WAVES.IF YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BE FLOUNDERING AROUND IN THE WHITE WATER ALL YOU REALLY NEED IS SOMETHING TO HOLD YOU UP AND KEEP YOU AFLOAT
A BODY WEIGHT SQUAT AGAIN HEELS AT OR SLIGHTLY WIDER THAN SHOULDERS WIDTH
SO ON A RANGE FROM ONE WEIGHT TO TEN WEIGHT OVER HERE YOU HAVE QUIET A RANGE OF CHOICES
YOU'LL NOTE THAT ON EACH OF THESE REELS SOMEWHERE I MADE A NOTATION OF WHAT THE BACKING IS 300 YARDS OF FORTY POUNDS TEST—THAT'S THREE FOOTBALL FIELDS—AND A TRIANGLE TAPER EIGHT WEIGHT INTERMEDIATE
ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM IS A TINY LITTLE REEL WHICH ISN'T MARKED BUT THIS IS AN OLD ORVIS CFO REEL AND THIS HAS GOT A ONE WEIGHT LINE ON IT AND ABOUT THIRTY YARDS OF BACKING
IF YOU GET OFF AND YOU START SLIDING DOWN WHICH IS VERY EASY YOUR WEIGHT IS GOING TO BE UNEVENLY DISTRIBUTED AND YOU COULD POSSIBLY LOSE YOUR BO STAFF
SECONDLY WE HAVE GOT TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE OUR WORKOUTS MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CHANGING THE WEIGHT WE ARE CHANGING THE WAY WE DO THOSE WORKOUTS AND LASTLY AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY MAKE SURE THAT OUR FORM IS PROPER
WHEN IT COMES TO THE SOCCER BALL THE SOCCER BALL NEEDS TO BE 68 TO SEVENTY CM IN DIAMETER AND IT WILL HAVE ABOUT 410 TO 450 GRAMS OF WEIGHT IN THERE SO THAT IT REALLY DOESN'T WEIGH TOO MUCH
THEY ARE SPECIES SPECIFIC SO THERE'S A DOG AND THERE'S A CAT AND THEY ARE WEIGHT SPECIFIC THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN WEIGHT GROUPS
NOW I'M GOING TO LIFT THE HIPS BY TURNING THE BACK TOES UNDER AND NOW I AM BALANCING ON THE FEET MOSTLY SO I'M GOING TO SHIFT THE WEIGHT INTO THE ARMS AND AS I DO SO KEEP THE BEND IN THE ELBOWS HUG THE CENTER LINE PRESS THROUGH THE FINGER LIFT THE SHOULDERS AWAY FROM THE FLOOR AND THEN TURN
WHEN YOU ARE SHIFTING FEET WHAT YOU DO IS SHIFT WEIGHT TO THE FORWARD PRESSURE OF THIS BOOT AND THIS WILL HELP YOU CARVE OUT THIS TURNOUT
WHEN YOU DO THE TOSS YOU SHIFT THE WEIGHT FROM YOUR RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR BODY TO YOUR LEFT SIDE OF YOUR BODY AND YOU JUST BRING YOUR ARM UP
AS I LAND MY WEIGHT STILL COMES HERE I SHIFT FORWARD IN TO THE PUNCH AND THEN AS I PLANT THE ARM BACK I THROW THE RIGHT LEG OUT
IF THE PUPPIES ARE GOING DOWN IN WEIGHT YOU NEED TO SEE YOUR VETERINARIAN AND FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM MIGHT BE
AS LONG AS THE PUPPIES ARE GOING UP IN WEIGHT THEN YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB
AND I LIKE FOR MY CLIENTS TO HAVE A LITTLE PAPER COLLAR THAT YOU PUT AROUND THE PUPPIES NECK WITH THEIR BIRTH WEIGHT ON IT AND THEN EVERY DAY AS YOU WEIGH THAT PUPPY YOU WRITE THE NEW WEIGHT ON THE COLLAR
SO YOU WANT YOUR WEIGHT TO BE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED CAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO SIDE TO SIDE
I HAVE ONE PIECE I LOVE USING THE CHILDRENS ARTS AND CRAFTS THAT THEY DID IN SCHOOL AND SO YOU'LL SEE THAT THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK CASE I HAVE A FEW OF THE ART PIECES THAT MY CHILD MADE AND BRING IN THOSE FUN PIECES LIKE PIPES AND SPECTACLES AND JUST USE THOSE ALSO BUT MAKE YOUR BOOK CASES INTERESTING ANCHOR THEM AND MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE WEIGHT IN THEM
ONE OF THE WAY WE CAN CONTROL THIS IS USING ACUPUNCTURE TO BALANCE THIS TWO SYSTEM SO THAT YOU WON'T HAVE OVER-ACTING DIGESTING AND RELAXING SYSTEM AND KEEP EATING UNTIL YOU GAIN TOO MUCH WEIGHT
FIRST THING YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR CRADLE IS GOING TO SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF YOUR HEAD
SO WHAT I DID THERE I PUT MY FOOT ON THE FLOOR THEN BEFORE I START TURNING I MOVE MY WEIGHT OVER MY FOOT AND I GAVE MYSELF SOME MOMENTUM BY PUSHING OFF
SO YOU PUT YOUR FOOT ON THE FLOOR WE ARE GOING TO SPIN AROUND THE RIGHT FOOT AND SO THE IDEA IS TO PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR FOOT AND THEN MOVE YOUR WEIGHT MOVE YOUR BODY WEIGHT YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY OVER THAT FOOT AND PUSH OFF WITH THE BACK FOOT
THIS IS GREG AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR DEMONSTRATION OF WEIGHT TRAINING FOR WOMAN
THE BASIC SQUAT WILL BEGIN BY ADDRESSING THE BAR HANDS EVEN STEPPING UNDERNEATH BALANCING THE WEIGHT ACROSS THE UPPER PART OF THE BACK LOWER PART OF THE SHOULDERS
ANOTHER HELPFUL THING IS IF THERE'S MORE WEIGHT CONCENTRATED ON THE FAR END
KEEP IN MIND THAT GARBAGE IS GENERALLY HAULED OUT BY WEIGHT WHICH MEANS IF IT IS A RAINY DAY IT COULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE FOR YOU TO PAY THE HAUL FEE
IF YOU'VE EVER TRIED TO PUSH DOWN ON SOMETHING IF YOU'VE HAD A HEAVY WEIGHT THE SHORTER DISTANCE YOU HAVE BETWEEN YOURSELF AND THAT WEIGHT THE HARDER IT IS TO PUSH DOWN
YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR WEIGHT THIS WAY AND LEAN OVER
AFTER I PERFORM MY SIX TO EIGHT REPETITIONS I'M GOING TO DROP THE WEIGHT AND WITH THESE POWER BLOCKS I'LL ADJUST THE WEIGHT FIVE POUNDS DOWN ON EITHER SIDE
AND ONCE I REACH MY SIX TO EIGHT REPETITIONS WHICH IS ABOUT THE TIME I'LL FATIGUE OR HIT FAILURE THEN I DROP THE WEIGHT BRING THE WEIGHT DOWN ANOTHER FIVE POUNDS AND CONTINUE
YOUR BONE DENSITY IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN WILL ACTUALLY IMPROVE BECAUSE THIS IS CONSIDERED A WEIGHT BEARING EXERCISE
MOUSSES ARE LIGHT WEIGHT
WE TURN OUR BODY SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT AND BRING OUR RIGHT HAND FORWARD AND WE THROW THE LEFT LEAD HOOK ONE THEN WE COME FORWARD LEFT HAND COMES TO MY FACE AND MY RIGHT HAND THROWS THE UPPER CUT TWO NOW FROM HERE MY LOAD UP I AM GOING TO TWIST BACK THIS WAY AND MY WEIGHT GOES TO MY RIGHT FOOT AND MY RIGHT SHOULDER PULLS MY LEFT HAND FORWARD AND I STEP IN LEAD HOOK REAR UPPER CUT
SO WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE IS YOU'RE BRINGING ALL THE WEIGHT OF YOUR BODY AND YOU'RE CARRYING IT UP AND DOWN
AND SO YOU WANT TO ADJUST THEIR WEIGHT IN THE CANOE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ALSO
THAT WAY I CAN GIVE VERBAL COMMANDS TO PAUL AS FAR AS IF HE HAS TO SHIFT HIS WEIGHT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND IT'S ALSO AN EASIER WAY TO TALK BACK AND FORTH WITH SOMEONE WHILE YOU'RE CANOEING BECAUSE YOU CAN BE FACE TO FACE
I'M CURLING THE WEIGHT
AGAIN CHOOSE A WEIGHT THAT'S GOING TO FATIGUE THE BICEP MUSCLE IN TEN FIFTEEN REPS ONE THREE SETS
IN THIS CLIP WITH A BICEP CURL WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT PROPER FORM AND HOW TO CHOOSE THE WEIGHT AND MAINTAIN THE PROPER FORM THROUGHOUT THE EXERCISE
YOU WANT TO START WITH YOUR FEET SHOULDER WIDTH HIP WIDTH APART YOU WANT YOUR ELBOWS IN TO THE SIDE WITH A NICE NEUTRAL WRIST CHOOSING A WEIGHT THAT'S GOING TO FATIGUE THAT MUSCLE IN TEN FIFTEEN REPS THREE SETS
WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE DOING THAT THEY'RE PICKING UP ALL THE WEIGHT IN THE GYM THEY'RE NOT FOCUSING IN ON JUST THAT BICEP MUSCLE
AND THIS OF COURSE IS GOING TO BE BASED ON HOW MUCH WEIGHT IT IS THAT YOU NEED TO LOSE
MY NAME IS CHRISTINE MARQUETTE AND I'M A REGISTERED DIETITIAN WITH THE AUSTIN REGIONAL CLINIC AND I AM GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO LOSE WEIGHT ON THE APPLE CIDER VINEGAR DIET
SO DEPENDING ON HOW FAR AWAY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WALK TO GET TO YOUR CAMPSITE OR HOW MUCH SUPPORT YOU HAVE GETTING TO YOUR CAMPSITE IF YOU HAVE A VEHICLE NEARBY OR A CANOE NEARBY YOU MAY CHOOSE LIGHT WEIGHT COOK GEAR OR YOU MAY CHOOSE TO BRING MORE EXTRAVAGANT COOK GEAR AND EAT A LITTLE BETTER
WE CAN USE SOMETHING THAT IS A LITTLE BIT LIGHTER WEIGHT CAUSE IT STILL WILL GET A NICE HOLD YET IT WOULD NOT WEIGHT HER HAIR DOWN WHICH IN THE END IT WILL MAKE HER HAIR FALL AS THE DAY GOES ON
WHEN YOU SINK DOWN INTO THE SECOND POSTURE LET ALL THE WEIGHT GATHER ON THE UNDERSIDE OF YOUR ARMS THE UNDERSIDE OF YOUR HANDS AND SINK DOWN INTO THIS LIKE YOU'RE JUST SINKING INTO EARTH
SO AGAIN YOU STEP PIVOT AS YOU PIVOT THE WEIGHT IS GOING TO COME TO THE RIGHT AND THEN YOU USE YOUR CHA-CHA-CHA TO COMPLETE THE TURN
LET'S TRY SLOWLY AGAIN WEIGHT SHIFT ONE
THIS IS WORTH IT'S WEIGHT IN GOLD
ALL THE RULES ARE THE SAME YOU JUST REALLY HAVE TO KIND OF MODIFY BASED ON EXACTLY HOW MUCH WEIGHT IT IS YOU NEED TO LOSE
NOW REMEMBER IF YOU HAVE GOT A LOT OF WEIGHT TO LOSE LET'S SAY 25 FIFTY 75 100 POUNDS YOU ARE PROBABLY GOING TO SEE A LOT MORE THAN TWO POUNDS IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS THEN IT WILL START TO LEVEL OFF
SO NOW YOU'RE STILL GETTING THE EFFECT OF THE EXERCISE WITHOUT TAKING QUITE SO MUCH WEIGHT
SLIDING ON YOUR TWO FRONT WHEELS KEEPING YOUR WEIGHT ON THE FRONT OF THE BOARD AND THEN AS SOON AS YOUR SLIDE IS DONE AND YOUR SPEED'S GONE YOU WANT TO POP YOUR BOARD OUT KIND OF LIKE A NOLLIE
WE CAN GET DOWN TO OUR SINGLE WHIP WE SLIDE OUR FOOT OUT THE HAND SCOOPS DOWN THE WEIGHT SHIFTS BACK AND WE'VE GOT CREEP LOW LIKE SNAKE
YOU WANT TO GO FROM THE TOP RIGHT FROM THE TOP AND IF YOU JUST GIVE A NICE LITTLE TUG ON THEM LIKE THAT EVEN THE WEIGHT OF THE THING ITSELF SHOULD BE ABLE TO PULL THEM OUT LIKE THAT YOU KNOW RIGHT FROM THE TOP JUST LIKE THAT COME OUT REALLY EASY
OK PUT MOST OF THE WEIGHT ON THIS LEG
AND SO IF YOU CAN FIND A CHALLENGING TRAIL AND ACTUALLY TIME YOURSELF ON IT AND DO REPEATS ON THAT TRAIL AND TRY TO CLEAN UP YOUR TURNING CLEAN UP YOUR SHIFTING OF YOUR WEIGHT WHERE YOU SHIFT ON THE SHIFT GEARS AND THOSE THINGS
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE LEANING A LITTLE BIT FORWARD SO THAT THE MOST OF YOUR WEIGHT IS ON THE BALLS OF YOUR FEET
SHIFTING WEIGHT SIDE TO SIDE RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT
THEN LET YOUR WEIGHT AND MOMENTUM CARRY YOU BACK OVER AND YOU'LL GO FAKIE DOWN THE OTHER SIDE THAT IS WHERE YOU FAKIES COME INTO PLAY
YOU THEN STAY BALANCED ON YOUR BACK FOOT WITH ALL OF YOUR WEIGHT GRINDING ON ONE TRUCK
WHEN APPROACHING THE RAMP YOU WANT TO HAVE A GOOD ANGLE WITH YOUR SKATEBOARD THE MAJORITY OF YOUR WEIGHT SHOULD BE ON YOUR BACK FOOT
IT IS LIGHT WEIGHT CONSTRUCTION AND WHAT THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE IS AN ASSEMBLY OF THE SHOCK ABSORBER AND THE SPRING IN ONE PIECE THAT IS LABELED A STRUT
THIS IS A REALLY CHALLENGING MOVE THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU TO BE CAREFUL WITH THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT THAT YOU HAVE
YOU CAN ALSO TRY WRIST WEIGHTS THEY COME IN ONE POUND WEIGHT SO YOU CAN WRAP THEM AROUND YOUR HAND AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HOLDING ANYTHING AS YOU'RE LIFTING
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING WITHIN A CIRCLE YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO NEED A COMPASS AND TO DRAW YOUR GRID YOU'RE USUALLY GOING TO WANT TO USE A LIGHT WEIGHT PENCIL
I'M GOING TO STEP IN I'M GOING TO STRIKE DOWN TO THE NOSE STRAIGHT IN DROP MY BODY WEIGHT
WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL PUT THE EDGE OF THE BLOCK ON THE FLOOR AND WE'LL USE OUR BODY WEIGHT AND LAY ON THE BLOCK SUPPORTING YOURSELF WITH YOUR ARMS
YOU'LL JUST WANT TO BREATHE INTO THE BLOCK AND TAKE YOUR TIME TO RELAX INTO THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY LAYING OVER THE BLOCK
IT'S REALLY LIGHT WEIGHT EASY TO PACK IT DOESN'T TAKE UP MUCH ROOM AT ALL
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE DOCUMENTATION OF THE KARAT WEIGHT AND DECIDE WHETHER YOU'RE BUYING FOR INVESTMENT OR WHETHER YOU'RE BUYING FOR SOMETHING TO WEAR BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE BUYING FOR SOMETHING TO WEAR YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO CONSIDER SETTING AND THE CUT AND THE CLARITY AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
IF YOU'RE BUYING JUST FOR AN INVESTMENT YOU'RE SIMPLY GOING TO GO FOR WEIGHT AND THE ONE THING TO REMEMBER THERE IS WHETHER THEY'RE SELLING YOU SCRAP WEIGHT OR WHETHER IT'S JUST THE ACTUAL WEIGHT OF THE PIECE
KEEPING THAT IN MIND ADJUSTING THE SHOULDER SO THE SHOULDER GOES BEYOND THE WEIGHT OF THE LEG
I'M A GOOFY-FOOTER SO IF I DID A TAIL WHEELIE MY WEIGHT WOULD CENTER OVER MY BACK FOOT BEING MY LEFT FOOT LIKE SO
DO THE SAME STEPS AND PUT ALL MY WEIGHT ON MY NOSE LIKE SO
YOU JUST HAVE ALL YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR NOSE INSTEAD OF YOUR TAIL AND YOU'RE GOING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SWITCHED
I AM A DECORATOR AND I LOVE DOING UNPREDICTABLE THINGS BUT I REALLY LIKE THE WEIGHT OF BOOKS IN A BOOK CASE SO A LOT OF THE TIPS THAT I WILL SHOW YOU AS FAR AS WORKING WITH BOOK CASES WE'LL BE USING BOOKS WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS NO MATTER HOW DEEP YOUR BOOK CASE IS I LIKE TO BRING THE BOOKS FORWARD SO IT LOOKS REALLY FULL AND I USUALLY BRING THE BOOKS FORWARD TO RIGHT TO THE EDGE OF THE SHELF AND THEN I LIKE USING LIKE SIZES
WEIGHT IS OPTIONAL TO WHATEVER YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH
I'M USING THE WEIGHT OF MY ARM TO PULL MY HEAD DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND I'M GOING TO REACH OUT AT AN ANGLE WITH THAT OTHER ARM
WEIGHT ON THE RIGHT FOOT
SO THEY NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING UNDERNEATH BOTH AS A DECORATIVE FEATURE AND TO ENCLOSE THE WEIGHT INSIDE SO IT WASN'T OUT SWINGING IN THE AIR
SO THEY WERE STILL DEALING WITH WEIGHT DRIVEN CLOCKS OF WEIGHT HANGING UNDERNEATH THE CLOCK WHICH POWERS IT
SO BRINGING ALL YOUR WEIGHT
UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN ALL THE WEIGHT IT GOES STRAIGHT TO YOUR KNEES TOO OKAY
HI MY NAME IS OTIS ST CLAIR AND TODAY I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WEIGHT TRAINING FOR INCREASED SPEED
THE NEXT EXERCISE WE ARE GOING TO DO IS THE SLED PULL SO IF YOU WILL FOLLOW ME OVER HERE WE ARE GOING TO USE WEIGHT TO PULL THE SLED TO HELP INCREASE OUR POWER AND OUR STRENGTH
WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A SLED WITH WEIGHT THAT IS ON IT ATTACHED TO A HARNESS
MY FRONT FOOT COMES UP MY BACK FOOT RISES SLIGHTLY AND BUT THE WEIGHT IS STILL ON THE BALLS OF THE FEET
AGAIN WEIGHT STILL CAN MOVE FORWARD
SO YOU'RE GOING TO START WITH A WEIGHT THAT YOU CAN PERFORM ABOUT SIX TO EIGHT REPETITIONS WITH AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO PROGRESSIVELY DROP THE WEIGHT AND CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME NUMBER OF REPETITIONS
SO AS I CURL THE WEIGHT UP I'M KEEPING MY ELBOWS LOCKED TO THE SIDES OF MY BODY
SHIFT THE WEIGHT ALL THE WAY TO THE LEFT SO THAT YOU CAN PICK UP YOUR RIGHT FOOT
SO AGAIN MOST OF YOUR WEIGHT IS ON THE LEFT
SOME PEOPLE KNOW IT AS THE BODY WEIGHT SQUAT BECAUSE IT'S JUST YOUR BODY WEIGHT
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE WEIGHT
FIND YOUR CENTER POINT AND SLOWLY ONCE AGAIN PUT SOME EVEN WEIGHT TO THE CENTER AND PULL OUT TOWARDS THE EDGE AT THE SAME TIME
YOU DON'T WANT TO PLACE A LOT OF WEIGHT ON YOUR HEAD SO YOUR HEAD IS BARELY TOUCHING
IF YOU'VE GOT TOO MUCH WEIGHT ON YOUR HAIR GO AHEAD AND LET THEM THIN IT OUT FOR YOU
SO IN THESE POSTURES WE'RE GOING TO WORK A LOT WITH SUPPORTING OUR OWN BODY WEIGHT
YOUR FREE WEIGHTS STARTING WEIGHT IS FIVE TO EIGHT POUNDS YOU CAN GO UP HEAVIER IF YOU NEED TO
AS WE GET CLOSER TO OUR GOAL WEIGHT IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CHALLENGING SO YOU'LL SEE THE GOAL REDUCE ACTUALLY AS THE PLAN MOVES FORWARD
BY THE END OF SIXTY DAYS WE'VE LOST AN ADDITIONAL TEN TO TWELVE BY NINETY DAYS WE'VE LOST AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT TO TEN AND THEN BY THE TIME YOU'VE HIT THAT GOAL IN FOUR MONTHS YOU'LL BE UP TO YOUR GOAL WEIGHT AND YOU'LL HAVE LOST THE BALANCE OF POUNDS THAT YOU NEED TO LOSE
YOU CAN LOSE WEIGHT BY SETTING THOSE GOALS
SO YOU OLLIE UP YOU MANUAL AND JUST ABOUT SIX INCHES BEFORE THE END YOU ADJUST YOUR WEIGHT
THE MAIN THING WITH THE SHAFT LIKE I SAID IS GOING TO BE THE STIFFNESS IN THE WEIGHT
BUT ONE THING THAT YOU DO WHEN YOU RIDE OFF-ROAD IS YOU HAVE TO SHIFT YOUR WEIGHT AROUND A LOT TO MAINTAIN TRACTION
NOW THIS ONE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF PRACTICAL PURPOSES BEING THIS BIG BUT IF YOU DO IT ON A SMALLER LINE THIS IS A NICE GREAT WEAVING HERE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN TRUST AND PUT A LOT OF WEIGHT ON
YOU ARE GETTING STARTED WITH YOUR WEIGHT MOSTLY ON YOUR FEET
AGAIN THIS IS GOING TO DEVELOP POWER AND EXPLOSIVENESS BY PULLING WEIGHT BEHIND US
YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE PROPER FIT AND SIZING THESE ARE ALL VERY SIMILAR PFDS BUT YOU CAN SEE THIS IS FOR A SMALLER PERSON A YOUNG CHILD PERHAPS JUST DESIGNED FOR THAT HEIGHT AND WEIGHT
WE DON'T WANT ANY WEIGHT ON THIS BECAUSE WE WANT THIS TO BE A FAST TWITCH MUSCLE GROUP WORK AS OPPOSED TO SLOW TWITCH
IN THIS PARTICULAR POSE WILLIE IS GOING TO BE THE HEAVEN AND GINA IS GOING TO GET TO BE THE EARTH BECAUSE WE WANTED TO SHOW YOU THAT IT IS NOT ALWAYS THE LARGER OR HEAVIER MALE PARTNER THAT IS ON THE BOTTOM TAKING THE WEIGHT
GOOD WILLIE NOW YOU WANT TO GENTLY LOWER DOWN GENTLY GENTLY GENTLY VERY SLOWLY BRING THE WEIGHT ON TO YOUR TOES AND THEN PRESS OFF OF GINA AND BACK
TO CALCULATE YOUR BODY MASS INDEX YOU WANT TO FIGURE OUT YOUR WEIGHT IN KILOGRAMS
ANYTHING ABOVE TWENTY-FIVE IS CONSIDERED OVER WEIGHT ALSO GOING INTO THE LATTER END OF OBESITY
AN OLLIE IS PRETTY MUCH WHERE YOUR WEIGHT IS JUST ON YOUR BACK FOOT
IT'S JUST AN INDEX CARD BECAUSE IT'S LIGHT WEIGHT GOT YOUR LINES
OBVIOUSLY AT THIS POINT THE BALL IS JUST A BRACE SO YOU DON'T NEED TO NECESSARILY INCREASE THE WEIGHT OF THE BALL BUT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF REPS ALRIGHT THE OBLIQUES
NOW OF COURSE YOU SEE WE ONLY HAVE SEVEN CARS BUT WE DON'T WANT TO JUST LOAD UP ANOTHER CAR BECAUSE THAT WILL OF COURSE ADD WEIGHT TO OUR TRAIN
AS YOU NOTICE AS I'M LOWERING MYSELF I'M GOING NICE AND SMOOTH I'M NOT GOING VERY FAST AND DROPPING MY WEIGHT
AND THE REASON FOR THIS IS WHEN ONE LEG IS INJURED WHEN THERE'S ARTHRITIS IN ONE SHOULDER THE OTHER LEG CARRIES MOST OF THE WEIGHT DOES EXTRA WORK
THE BODY TENDS TO GET OUT OF PHYSICAL BALANCE SO THE DOG WILL STAND SLIGHTLY CROOKED PUTTING THE WEIGHT ON ONE LEG RATHER THAN THE OTHER
WE ALSO HAVE SPECIALTY TYPE SET-UPS WHERE WE HAVE HOOKS SWIVELS AND FLIES ATTACHED TO A LINE WITH AN EGG WEIGHT SINKER AN EGG DROP SINKER ON THE BOTTOM
SO THERE'S A LITTLE WEIGHT TRANSFER THAT YOU'VE GOT TO GET USED TO
IF YOU WANTED TO DO A NOSE WHEELIE JUST SWITCH IT UP AND PUT ALL OF YOUR WEIGHT OVER YOUR LEFT FOOT AND RAISE YOUR RIGHT FOOT
A TAIL WHEELIE ALL OF YOUR WEIGHT WOULD BE FOCUSED ON YOUR RIGHT LEG LIKE SO
OVER HERE THE MIDDLE WEIGHT BIKES THESE ALSO HAVE LIMITED COLLECTABILITY
KEEP THE WEIGHT FORWARD ON THE BALLS OF YOUR FEET
THINK OF PRESSING THE WEIGHT THROUGH YOUR BACK LITTLE TOE AND LET THE CROWN OF THE HEAD RISE
OBLIQUES DOING SIDE TO SIDE MAYBE WITH A WEIGHT OKAY OTHER CRUNCHES THAT WE CAN DO FOR OUR STOMACH AND FINALLY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT UPPER BODY
SOMETIMES WE FORGET ABOUT IT AND WE DO OUR CARDIO EXERCISING AND OUR WEIGHT TRAINING AND WE JUST KIND OF DITCH THE STRETCHING AT THE END BUT FLEXIBILITY IS HUGELY IMPORTANT NUMBER ONE
YOU CAN AVOID THAT BY LISTENING TO YOUR GUIDE AND PADDLING IF YOU HIT THE ROCK ANYWAY THE GUIDE SHOUTS OUT “HIGH SIDE' IF YOU CLIMB TOWARD THE HIGH SIDE OF THE ROCK THE HIGH SIDE OF THE RAFT THEN THE WEIGHT WILL COME OFF THE LOW SIDE AND YOU CAN SPIN OFF THAT ROCK CELEBRATE A CLOSE CALL AND CONTINUE ON DOWNSTREAM
IF YOUR GOAL IS TO GAIN MUSCLE AND MASS YOU ARE ONLY GOING TO WANT TO DO CARDIO ABOUT ONE TIME WEEK BECAUSE IF YOU DO TOO MUCH CARDIO IT COULD ACTUALLY TEAR DOWN THE MUSCLE AND MAKE THE MUSCLE GROUP SMALLER SO IF YOUR GOAL IS TO BUILD MASS YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO DO MORE WEIGHT TRAINING THAN YOU ARE CARDIOVASCULAR TRAINING
YOUR WEIGHT IS ON THE HEELS IN THIS EXERCISE
WHEN WE GET TO THIS PATTERN YOU WILL SEE THAT THEY ALL NEED TO BE THE SAME WEIGHT TO KEEP A CONSISTENT PATTERN AND FLOW GOING SO THESE TWO ARE THE SAME
WHEN YOU READ A PACKAGE OF YARN THIS ONE SAYS WORSTED WEIGHT FOUR PLY
THAT TAKES SOME OF THE WEIGHT OFF OF GETTING THE DRAWING RIGHT
THE TRICK IS TO ALWAYS KEEP YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR RIGHT FOOT SO YOU'RE LEFT KNEE'S GOING TO BE THE ONE THAT'S BENDING THE WHOLE TIME
SO I'M HAVING MY WEIGHT ON THE BACK ON THE FRONT BACK FRONT BACK YOU'RE RIGHT LEG KIND OF STAYS STRAIGHT THERE
NOW MAKE SURE YOU PRACTICE THAT KEEPING YOUR WEIGHT OVER YOUR FEET AND KEEPING YOUR CHEST LIFTED
MOST PEOPLE THINK WOOL IS ONLY TO KEEP YOUR FOOT WARM BUT IF YOU CONSIDER THE FACT THAT MOST MEN'S TROPICAL WEIGHT BUSINESS SUITS ARE MADE OUT OF WOOL YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WOOL IS ACTUALLY A COOLING AND A WARMING FABRIC
THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS LEAN BACK USE A WEIGHT THAT IS RESPONSIBLE THAT YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH
YOU CAN'T SQUEEZE AND GET IT OUT I DON'T KNOW HOW IT GETS IN THERE BUT ONE OF THE WAYS TO KILL THIS IS TO HAVE IT FULL OF WATER AND SINCE THEY'RE TO COUNTERACT THE WEIGHT OF THE CLEANER HAVING IT FULL OF WATER IS NOT A GREAT BALLAST IDEA
IN A PINCH IT IS A LOT LESS WEIGHT AND BULK IN A FILTER AND IN A PINCH YOU CAN JUST CHOOSE IODINE TABLETS TO MAKE SURE YOUR WATER IS REASONABLY POTABLE
IF IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU'RE FEEDING A CERTAIN AMOUNT AND YOUR DOG CONTINUES TO BE HEAVY OR IN FACT GAIN WEIGHT THEN YOU WOULD ACTUALLY JUST FEED LESS PER MEAL UNTIL YOU HIT UPON AN AMOUNT THAT YOU WANT TO FEED
IF THE DOG WAS YOUNGER AND ACTIVE YOU MIGHT JUST THROW A BUNCH OF CHICKEN NECKS IN AND BE MONITORING THE DOGS WEIGHT AS YOU GO ALONG
SOME PLACE AGAIN THAT IS REALLY SOLID WILL SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE AND IS A PLACE THAT WON'T DO ANY DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE OR ANY OF THE VEHICLE COMPONENTS AS WELL
BUT TWELVE FOR THIS MEDIUM WEIGHT YARN IS A GOOD NUMBER FOR OUR BASE CIRCLE SO IT CAN CONTINUE
DROP THE WEIGHT STRAIGHT DOWN
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT I MOVE IN WITH MY WHOLE BODY WEIGHT AND MOMENTUM
SO OF THESE FOUR CATEGORIES OF BICYCLES I HAVE HERE THERE'S A BALLOON TIRE BIKE A MIDDLE WEIGHT BIKE A MUSCLE BIKE AND AN ENGLISH BIKE
YOU GET BETTER RESULTS THAT WAY YOU KEEP BREATHING VERY SLOWLY YOU DON'T WANT TO JERK THE WEIGHT UP AND DOWN YOU CONTROL THE WEIGHT DON'T LET THE WEIGHT CONTROL YOU
EXHALE FOLD DOWN YOU CAN BEND YOUR KNEES AND PUSH BACK TO PLANK AND THEN EXHALE YOUR KNEES HUG THOSE ELBOWS IN WEIGHT EVEN IN THE HANDS CHEST CHIN AND PUSH UP TO COBRA
I TRACE ALONG THE BACK HERE AND YOU'RE GOING TO NOTICE VERY QUICKLY THAT THE DRAWING STARTS TO TAKE ON SOME MORE DEPTH SOME MORE WEIGHT THREE DIMENSIONAL ATTRIBUTES AS OPPOSED TO JUST HAVING THE GOOD BUT STILL ULTIMATELY QUICKLY SCRIGGLED ON LINES WE STARTED WITH
LET YOUR BODY LEAD YOU AS YOU FEEL THE WEIGHT GOING DOWN AND UP AND EVENTUALLY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TURN IN A FULL CIRCLE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS
AND YOUR FEET ARE GROUNDED AND YOU'VE GOT TO PUSH YOUR WEIGHT IN THE HEEL IN ORDER TO KEEP THAT KNEE BEHIND THE TOE
NOW WE KEEP THE HANDS AT THAT CORNER BUT I SHIFT MY WEIGHT AND TURN MY WAIST
SO APPLE CIDER VINEGAR IN AND OF ITSELF IS NOT AN UNHEALTHY THING TO USE BUT IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT IS A MIRACLE WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENT
IT IS NOT GOING TO CAUSE YOU TO LOSE A LOT OF WEIGHT
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH APPLE CIDER VINEGAR BUT AGAIN IT IS NOT REALLY GOING TO MAKE YOU LOSE WEIGHT
LIKE WE MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE GRAPH-EYE SHAFT THEY HAVE THE WEIGHT OF THE SHAFT RIGHT HERE
IN FACT MOST PEOPLE CAN'T EVEN GOOD CLIMBERS YOU WANT TO USE YOUR LEGS IN A LOT OF CLIMBING TECHNIQUES IS FIGURING HOW TO PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR FEET TO SPARE YOUR ARMS
SO YOU CAN JUST DO THE ARM AND USE IT MOST KINDA LIKE WEIGHT BEARING
MANY TIMES WE SEE AMATEURS JUST HITTING UP ON THE BALL AND HITTING WHERE THE CLUB FACE IS AHEAD OF THE HANDS AND THE WEIGHT REMAINS INTO YOUR BACK LEG YOUR RIGHT LEG FOR RIGHT HANDED PLAYERS
THIS IMPACT BAG IS REALLY GOING TO TEACH YOU THE HABIT OF COMING TO THE CORRECT IMPACT POSITION AND IF YOU NOTICE HERE MY WEIGHT IS WAILING TO MY LEFT SIDE THE CLUB FACE IS BEHIND MY HANDS SO MY HANDS ARE HEAD AND IN THIS POSITION I AM ABLE TO HIT DOWN ON THE BALL
ANOTHER ONE IS THAT WE CAN SHIFT OUT WEIGHT LET OUR ARMS SWING LIKE A DRUM
SO YOU NEED TO LOSE SOME WEIGHT AND YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO GET SOME EXERCISE IN
AND I'M GOING TO SHARE SOME IDEAS WITH YOU AND MAKE SOME SUGGESTIONS AS TO HOW YOU CAN SET SOME WEIGHT LOSS GOALS THAT WILL WORK FOR YOU
LET'S DO THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL SO YOU NEVER HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN AND YOU CAN KEEP THE WEIGHT OFF
BECAUSE IT'LL JUST SLIP RIGHT OUT NO MATTER HOW MUCH WEIGHT YOU OR LOAD YOU PUT ON IT
AND SO THEN FAITH CAN JUST LOWER RIGHT TO THAT POINT AND THEN BRING HER WEIGHT FORWARD AND COME RIGHT UP INTO YOUR UP DOG
THE WEIGHT SHIFTS BACK AND NOW WE HAVE OUR CREEP LOW LIKE SNAKE
IF YOU HAVE JUST THE HIP PACK YOU CAN'T ADJUST YOUR SHOULDER STRAPS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ALL YOUR WEIGHT RIGHT HERE IT'S GOING TO PROBABLY GO ON YOUR BACK AND THIS WILL BE PRETTY COMFORTABLE ALSO
YOU CAN EAT A LOT AND NOT PUT ON WEIGHT
WE ALSO WANT TO PLACE THE WEIGHT ON THE BALLS OF YOUR FEET
THEY SHOULD FIT SNUGGLY YOU SHOULD FEEL PUNCH ON YOUR CHEEKS THEY SHOULD NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE AND STICK A FINGER IN THE FRONT OF YOUR HELMET THE REST IS JUST PROFILE AND DESIGN AND WHAT IT'S MADE OF AND WEIGHT
IT IS JUST A SIMPLE IDEA OF SHIFTING YOUR WEIGHT AND FIGURING OUT WHEN TO SHIFT YOUR WEIGHT
SINCE YOU ARE NOT DOING IT WITH ANY TYPE OF WEIGHT DUMBBELL OR BARBELL YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO KEEP IT HIGH REPS SINCE IT'S SO LOW ON WEIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST DOING YOUR BODY WEIGHT SO CONTINUE THIS MOTION AGAIN FOR ABOUT TWENTY REPS OF THREE TO FOUR SETS AND THAT'S THE FREESTANDING SQUAT
BASICALLY WE JUST WANT TO PLACE THE JACK UNDERNEATH THIS LOWER LIP OF THE BODY PANEL THERE WHERE IT'S DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THE WEIGHT AND THEN WE'RE JUST GOING TO SCREW IT UP AND LIFT THE CAR UP SO WE CAN REMOVE THE WHEEL
NOW MY WEIGHT IS IN MY FRONT LEG BUT I'M STILL CONNECTED TO THE SOURCE OF MY MOVEMENT
SO START RIGHT HERE AS WE MOVE IN TOWARD THAT OPPONENT MALE A CIRCLE TIGHTEN THAT WRIST UP AND STRIKE I WANT TO DROP MY WHOLE BODY WEIGHT DOWN OVER THAT PERSON
SO WE HAVE A PERSON DOWN ON THE GROUND I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE FIRST JUST THE MOVEMENT YOU'RE GOING TO START WITH THE STAGGERED STANCE BOTH HANDS ARE UP NOW TO GENERATE POWER FOR THAT FOR THE STRIKE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THE HAND STRIKING IS GOING TO MAKE A CIRCLE THAT'S GOING TO CLOSE AND YOU'RE GOING TO DROP THAT BODY WEIGHT STRAIGHT DOWN ON YOUR TARGET
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO TO FIX THAT IS YOU WANT TO SET UP IN YOUR HEEL FLIP POSITION HIT THE TAIL AND THEN REPLACE THE WEIGHT ON THE FRONT SIDE OF IT SO THAT YOUR WEIGHT IS BALANCED EVENLY AND IT ENDS UP FLIPPING STRAIGHT AND YOU'RE ABLE TO ROLL AWAY
ONE OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE USUALLY HAVE IS THEY DON'T PUT ENOUGH WEIGHT OVER THE FRONT OF THE BOARD
SO THAT'S ONE WAY TO BE ABLE TO TELL IF IF THE WEIGHT OF THE BAT IS TOO HEAVY OR YOU KNOW IF IT FITS
FOR A YOUNGER ATHLETE THE WAY TO TEST IT AS FAR AS SIZE GOES AND WEIGHT IS YOU WANT TO HAVE EM HOLD IT WITH THEIR THEIR BOTTOM THEIR DOMINANT HAND MAYBE CHOKE UP ABOUT AN INCH AND THEY AND AND THEN HOLD IT OUT AND THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIRMLY GRIP IT AND AND HOLD IT WITHOUT YOU KNOW WITHOUT IT SHAKING
