BUT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT YOUR SPEECH OR WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT YOUR STYLE STRUCTURE IN YOUR WRITING OR WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'VE MADE A GREAT DECISION YOU'RE GOING TO INTERVIEW SOMEONE FOR A PAPER OR A SPEECH OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE YOU NEED RESEARCH MATERIAL FOR
THOSE ARE THE THINGS IN YOUR SPEECH THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GIVE EXTRA EMPHASIS OR EXTRA STRESS TO
IF THEY RELATE TO YOU OR TO SOMETHING IN YOUR SPEECH IT WILL BE MEMORABLE FOR THEM
BUT WHAT ARE THE THINGS WITHIN YOUR SPEECH THAT YOU CAN REALLY HIT FOR THE AUDIENCE TO RELATE TO
YOU HAVE TO KNOWS WHAT THEIR MAKEUP IS ARE THEY MEN ARE THEY WOMEN ARE THEY OLD ARE THEY YOUNG ARE THEY INTO SPORTS NOT INTO SPORTS ARE THEY RELIGIOUS NOT RELIGIOUS WHATEVER IT IS AND THEN WHAT IN YOUR SPEECH IS GOING TO BE RELEVANT TO THEM WHAT CAN THEY RELATE TO
BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT WE DO AND SAY AND COMMUNICATE VERBALIZES AND EXPRESSES ARE WORTH OUR SPEECH OR ACTIONS OUR POSTURE EVERYTHING
SOME DEAF PEOPLE GREW UP LEARNING SPEECH AND FOCUSING ON SPEECH THERAPY LIKE MYSELF
NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT MIGHT HELP YOU HELP YOUR AUDIENCE TO REMEMBER YOU OR A SPECIFIC PART OF A SPEECH OR MAYBE AN AREA THAT'S REAL IMPORTANT IN YOUR SPEECH
THERE ARE LOTS OF LITTLE THINGS THAT ALREADY EXIST OR POSSIBLY SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD MAKE UP TO HELP YOUR AUDIENCE REMEMBER SOMETHING SPECIFIC ABOUT YOUR SPEECH
IF YOU TEND TO RECITE YOUR SPEECH BY ROTE AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS YOU'VE PRACTICED IT SO MUCH YOU'VE SAID IN THE SHOWER IN THE CAR IN YOUR SLEEP TO YOUR FRIENDS TO YOUR MOM TO EVERYBODY YOU KNOW AND SO YOU'RE JUST SPITTING IT OUT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT SO WELL THE AUDIENCE IS GOING TO BE AWARE OF THAT
WHAT IT'S GOING TO COME ACROSS LIKE IS THAT YOU HAVE MEMORIZED YOUR SPEECH
AND WHEN YOU'VE MEMORIZED YOUR SPEECH YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT WORDS COME NEXT
TO GIVE THE ILLUSION OF IMPERCEPTIBLE SPEECH THERE CAN BE NO MOVEMENT
THERE ARE MANY OTHER THINGS THAT CAN BE USED IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING A SPEECH
BUT CERTAINLY THE USE OF THE HANDS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL IN ORDER TO EMPHASIZE AND ALSO SOMETIMES IN ORDER TO POINT YOURSELF IN TO A CERTAIN DIRECTION IN THE SPEECH
AND WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS THERE'S SO MUCH ANXIETY WHEN YOU'RE GIVING SPEECHES ANYWAY BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT WE WANT TO DO AS A SPEECH GIVER OR A PRESENTER IS COME ACROSS LIKE WE'RE TALKING TO THE AUDIENCE NOT AT THE AUDIENCE
