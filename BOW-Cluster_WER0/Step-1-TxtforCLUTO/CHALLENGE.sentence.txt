CHALLENGE HERE TO THE BALANCE AS YOU TAKE THE LEG OUT
NOW IF YOU WANTED TO ADD AN EXTRA CHALLENGE YOU COULD ACTUALLY REACH OVER TO THE SIDE COME DOWN TO THE CENTER YOU COULD CROSS AND COME BACK TO CENTER AND JUST STEP IT UP JUST A LITTLE BIT
ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS EXERCISE IS YOU ARE ACTUALLY CAUSING YOUR INNER THIGHS TO CONTRACT AGAINST THE MEDICINE BALL WHICH IS GOING TO ADD AN EXTRA CHALLENGE AND YOU ARE GOING TO FEEL IT A LITTLE BIT DEEPER IN YOUR ABDOMINALS
AND SOMETIMES IT'S A LITTLE DAUNTING WHEN IT'S ELEVEN O'CLOCK AND YOU'VE GOT THIRTY MORE MINUTES TO FINISH YOUR DEADLINE TO MAKE YOUR DEADLINE BUT I ALSO REALLY LIKE THE CHALLENGE OF THAT
ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY LIKE MOST ABOUT BEING A SPORTS WRITER IS THAT IT'S A DAILY CHALLENGE FOR ME WORKING HERE IN NASHVILLE TENNESSEE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO READ WHAT I WRITE
BUT I ALSO LOVE THE CHALLENGE OF IT BECAUSE I LIKE THE FACT THAT I NEED TO PRODUCE SOMETHING THAT IS FACTUALLY CORRECT AND INTERESTING ENOUGH FOR THESE PEOPLE TO WANT TO PICK UP AND READ NOT ONLY TOMORROW BUT THE NEXT DAY AND THE NEXT DAY AND THE NEXT DAY
SO EACH DAY IT'S KIND OF A CHALLENGE TO CRAFT SOMETHING TO PUT IT TOGETHER AND MAKE IT INTERESTING
NOW SOME OF THE GROUPS LIKE COMEDY SPORTS OR SOME OF THE THEATER GROUPS THEY'LL RAISE THE CHALLENGE ON THAT WHERE THEY'LL TAKE TURNS WITH EACH LETTER OF THE ALPHABET
SEE WHEN WE DID THAT IT GOT US UP TO STAGE TWO OF THIS CHALLENGE BUT NOT ALL THE WAY UP
SO EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE THEORETICALLY IN FRONT OF THIS LINE SO WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO CHALLENGE EACH OTHER BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN THE FRONT COURT
SO WE'RE GOING TO CHALLENGE EACH OTHER
LETTER F NOW THE LETTER F IS GOING TO CHALLENGE YOUR SKILLS BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE LETTER F FROM THE TOP OF THE ASCENDER SPACE ALL THE WAY DOWN THROUGH THE DESCENDER SPACE
SAME THING HERE THIS IS A CHALLENGE RIGHT HERE BETWEEN THESE TWO LETTERS THAT'S JUST NATURALLY A BIG SPACE SO SOMEHOW I'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TIGHTEN THAT UP AND I COULD
IT COULD BE EASY FOR YOU OR IT COULD BE A CHALLENGE FOR YOU
NOT MUCH MORE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HOW MUCH YOU DO JUST BLOCK AN HOUR OF TIME SIT DOWN AND CHALLENGE YOURSELF TO CREATE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF STYLES BASED OFF OF ONE SILHOUETTE
THEY WILL OFTEN ASK YOU WHAT DO YOU COVER IN YOUR BRIEFINGS AND IF IT'S SOMEBODY THAT IS NOT EXPERIENCED THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO COVER IN THE BRIEFINGS YOU KNOW THEY'LL SAY OKAY HERE'S A CHALLENGE WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IF THIS HAPPENS
SOME OTHER CHALLENGES TRIVIA CHALLENGES THERE IS THREE OF THEM THERE IS THE TAKE THREE CHALLENGE IN GREEN SONGS AND SLOGGING CHALLENGE AND A POP CULTURE CHALLENGE
SO THEY ARE ON YOUR TRIVIA CARDS THERE ARE JUST DIFFERENT TYPES OF QUESTIONS THE TAKE 32 CHALLENGE FOR INSTANCE YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY A ACTOR ACTRESS OR MOVIE FROM THREE CLUES ON THE CARD THAT IS WHY IT IS CALLED TAKE THREE
IF YOU ROLL ALL PLAY THE DVD MASTER WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL WILL SELECT THAT FOR YOU ALL PLAY FROM THE DVD AND ALL PLAYERS THAT MEANS WHY IT SAYS ALL PLAY SHOULD WATCH THE CHALLENGE THAT FOLLOWS THAT MEANS EVERYONE IS GOING TO PRECIPITATE VERSES THE EARLIER ONE WHICH IS MY PLAY THE PERSON PLAYING ONLY GET TO ANSWER
I ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE THE CHALLENGE TO WORK LARGE AND WORK WITH A LARGER PIECE OF WOOD
AND THERE IN LIES THE CHALLENGE
AND THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO PROVE YOUR HANDLING ABILITIES THAN TO JUST CHALLENGE YOURSELF BY FINDING DIFFICULT TECHNICAL TRAILS
TO ADVANCE THE EXERCISE I COME UP ON TO BOTH LEGS SO I'VE ADDED THE BALANCE CHALLENGE PLACE THE HAND BY THE EAR AND AGAIN THE MOVEMENT IS INITIATED FROM THE OBLIQUE MUSCLES ON THE SIDE LIFTING UP
IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE BEFORE
SO WE FIRST GO OUT AND TRY TO ACHIEVE THE PURCHASE OF A GOOD COW HORSE KEEP THOSE COW SKILLS ALIVE KEEP WORKING THEM ON THE COWS BUT WE ALSO LET THEM GET JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE IN THEIR EFFORTS TO CHALLENGE THOSE COW MOVES WHEN WE NEED THEM AT THE BRINK OF A SECOND
BUT WHAT WE LOOK FOR IS A HORSE THAT'S VERY BOLD AND BRAVE AND NOT GOING TO BE INTIMIDATED BY THE CHALLENGE OF A STRONG COW
NOW THAT YOU KNOW WHAT SCENE IT CHALLENGE IS IN OUR UP COMING CLIP WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WINNING THE GAME AND ALSO DOUBLE FEATURE SPACES
NOW IF THAT'S TOO MUCH OF A CHALLENGE FOR YOU YOU CAN ALWAYS REST YOUR HAND ON THE MAT OR ON THE BOSU BALANCE TRAINER
