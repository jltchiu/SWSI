SO YOU WANT TO HAVE IF YOU MISS THE FIRST ONE THE FIRST ONE IS GOING TO GIVE YOU LOTS OF CLUES OF WHAT YOU'VE MISSED
WITH SHOES THIS IS HIT AND MISS THERE'S A LOT OF TIMES THAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO FIND A BETTER PRICE ON A SHOE ON A STORE SITE THAN YOU WOULD ON A MANUFACTURER'S SENDING IT TO YOU DIRECTLY
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COME OUT HERE AND MAYBE I'LL MISS MY FIRST ONE BUT YOU'VE GOT TO JUST KEEP PRACTICING AND PRACTICING TO REALLY GET AN IDEA OF WHERE YOU WANT TO HIT
ONCE YOU HAVE HIM IN YOUR CHAIR YOU CAN START TO ACCESSORIZE HIM ALSO GIVE HIM A ONCE OVER MAKE SURE YOU DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING
SOME EXAMPLES OF SOME AGES BABY MISS ZERO TWO YEARS OLD TINY MISS THREE FIVE YEARS OLD LITTLE MISS SIX EIGHT AND ON UP TO JUNIOR MISS TEEN MISS AND MISS
NOW DON'T FORGET TO WORK YOUR ABS NEVER MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PULL THAT NAVEL IN TOWARDS YOUR SPINE
ONE OF THE NEXT THINGS THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT EASY STEP TO MISS IS FILLING UP THE WATER TANK WHICH ON THIS MACHINE IS UNDER THIS UNDER THIS PLATE RIGHT HERE IN THE BACK OF THE MACHINE
AND THEN YOU CATCH ONE AND THEN YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE YOU WERE AND SO YOU MISS THE ENTIRE SCHOOL WHILE THEY'RE THERE
DON'T FORGET CAUSE IF YOU ONLY STUDY TECHNIQUE AND REPERTOIRE THEN YOU GOING TO MISS OUT IN MUSICIANSHIP AND SOMEBODY IS GOING TO ASK YOU WHAT YOU ARE PLAYING AND YOU DON'T KNOW
IF YOU MISS LIKE THIS OOP YOU'RE EITHER GOING TO DO A 540 TAIL TAP OR YOU'RE JUST GOING TO FALL
AND THE ODDS OF THEM THREE-PUTTING ARE PRETTY HIGH NOT BECAUSE THEY MISS THE SECOND ONE SO MUCH AS THEY DIDN'T LAG THE FIRST ONE CLOSE ENOUGH TO WHERE IT WAS YOU KNOW JUST A TAP IN
THESE GUYS EITHER MAKE THE SHOT OR THEY MISS THE SHOT
YOU'RE LOOKING IN THE YELLOW PAGES YOU'RE LOOKING ON-LINE FOR SOMEBODY IT'S HIT OR MISS YOU MAY GET SOMEBODY GOOD YOU MAY GET SOMEBODY BAD YOU DON'T KNOW
JUST DON'T MISS THE GLOVE BECAUSE THEN MOM WILL REALLY BE MAD
KATATE-TORI IF WE MISS THAT ONE WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO KOKINAGI
THEY MISS THE SHOT THESE TWO GUYS ARE FLYING OUT GOING THE OTHER WAY AND THE FIRST GUY ON THIS SIDE COMES IN TO JOIN THEM
THESE THREE GUYS ATTACK EITHER MAKE THE SHOT OR MISS THE SHOT
SO WHEN YOU ARE SETTING THE BALL TAKE THE BALL ABOVE YOUR HEAD WHERE IF YOU MISS THE BALL IT WILL HIT YOU IN YOUR FOREHEAD
THERE MIGHT BE HOLES THAT YOU CAN PULL STRAIGHT DOWN ON BUT THERE MAY NOT BE AND IF YOU ARE NOT OPEN TO THE IDEA OF USING HOLES THAT DON'T LOOK LIKE LADDER LINES YOU WOULD MISS OUT ON A LOT
SO REACH LONG AND LEAN LIKE MISS CARRIE OVER HERE
AND ONCE I'VE MINCED ALL OF THEM I'LL GO AHEAD AND MINCE THEM ALL TOGETHER ONE MORE TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT I DIDN'T MISS ANY BIG PIECES
