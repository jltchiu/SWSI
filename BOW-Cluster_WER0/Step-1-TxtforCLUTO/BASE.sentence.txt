LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY WITH THE HIPS ESTABLISH THE BASE WITH THE ARMS
YOU KEEP YOUR ARMS RIGHT AT SHOULDER LEVEL RIGHT AND YOU ESTABLISH A WIDE BASE
SO WE'VE GOT OUR BASE COAT DOWN AND NOW YOU START THINKING OF DIFFERENT COLORS THAT YOU CAN LAYER UP WITH
SO YOU'RE GOING TO PULL ALL THE MUSCLES ON THE BASE OF YOUR PELVIC FLOOR
AND YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW YOUR MILE PACE AND THINGS AND BASE THINGS OFF THAT
SO THIS YELLOW ORANGE BLUE VIOLET IS GOING TO NEUTRALIZE IT AND MAKE A NICE BROWN BASE
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE PART OF THE STICK THAT'S STICKING OUT SHOULD BE BOTH OF THEM SHOULD BE EVEN SO THAT THE FRAME STANDS STRAIGHT UP AND BY THE WEIGHT OF THE BORDER THE THICKNESS OF THE CORRUGATED PAPER AND ALSO THE STICKS THAT ARE INSIDE THIS WILL CREATE A NICE STRONG STURDY SUPPORT TO LET THE BORDER STAND UP STRAIGHT ONTO THE BASE OF THE STAGE
SO NOW I'VE SHOWN YOU HOW TO INSERT THE WOODEN SKEWER STICKS INTO THE PICTURE FRAME BORDER SO THAT IT WILL STAND ERECT ONTO THE BASE OF OUR PUPPET STAGE THEATER
IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DO LOTS AND LOTS OF YOUR OWN WORK YOU CAN GET ONE THAT DOES NOT HAVE THIS POWER BASE AND IT IS JUST A HANDLE LIKE THIS
THIS IS YOUR MORE GENERIC PAINT IT'S USUALLY A VEGETABLE BASE OIL
IF YOU CAN'T GET IT IN TO THIS GUY RUN THE BASE LINE GET IT IN TO THIS GUY ALRIGHT
NOW AS THE RUNNER IS COMING AS SHE'S PUSHING TOWARDS THE BASE THE MOMENTUM AS SHE IS ABOUT TO FALL GET LOW AND THEN EXTEND WITH BOTH OF HER HANDS GOING TO THE BASE
NORMALLY WHEN YOU'RE STEALING SECOND BASE THIS IS A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE SLIDE AS IF YOU WERE SLIDING REGULAR WITH FEET AHEAD GOING TO SECOND BASE
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS RIGHT AFTER WE'VE PLANTED OUR PLANT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OURSELVES A LITTLE EARTHEN DAM A FEW INCHES DEEP SO THAT THE WATER THAT WE PUT IN HERE AT THE BASE OF THE PLANT STAYS HERE
THEN I WANT TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF A HIGHLIGHT IN THE CORNER OF THE EYE SO I'M GOING TO TAKE THE SAME COLOR THE SHIMMERY COLOR THAT I USED AS A BASE AND I'M GOING TO PUT THAT RIGHT IN THE CORNER OF HER EYE
A FULL SCORE HAS ALL THE PARTS OF THE ENSEMBLE IF IT'S A STRING ORCHESTRA IT HAS THE VIOLIN VIOLA CELLO'S DOUBLE BASE AND IF IT'S A SYMPHONIC ORCHESTRA IT WILL HAVE ALL THE STRINGS THE WOOD WINDS AND THE BRASS AND PERCUSSION
WE ARE READY TO PUT OUR MERINGUE ON OUR BAKED ALASKA BASE
WE'VE ALREADY GLUED UP THE PIECES FOR THE BASE AND WHILE THEY'RE DRYING WE'RE GOING TO CUT THE LUMBER TO MAKE THE TALL PIECE THAT GOES IN THE MIDDLE
SO I'M GOING TO APPLY THIS BASE PAINT OVER IT OVER THE MASKING TAPE AND THAT WILL HELP ME PLACE A NICE EVEN COAT OF COLORED PAINT ALONG THE PICTURE FRAME
SO WHEN YOU ARE WORKING ON SOMEBODY LIKE THAT YOU CAN WORK THROUGH CLOTHES YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ANY SPECIAL OILS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND JUST COME THROUGH AND KIND OF WORK A LITTLE BIT ON THE BACK AND WHEN YOU ARE DOING THAT YOU CAN USE YOUR LOOSE FISTS RIGHT HERE AND JUST PRESS IN TO THE MUSCLES IN THE BACK AREA AND RUB THROUGH THE NECK LIKE THIS A LITTLE BIT AND RUB ESPECIALLY ALONG THE OCCIPITAL AREA RIGHT HERE AT THE BASE OF THE SKULL
IT FEELS REALLY GOOD AND WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS DO A LITTLE LIFT WHERE YOU JUST KIND OF USE THE FOREHEAD AND THE BASE OF THE SKULL AND LIFT UP AND THAT KIND OF LEAVES A LOT OF TENSION IN PEOPLES NECKS AND HELPS THEM
NOW THE FRAME THAT WE'VE CREATED NEEDS A WAY TO STAND UP ONTO THE BASE OF OUR STAGE SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE THE WOODEN STICKS GO INSIDE THE CORRUGATED PAPER AND THAT WILL CREATE A STAND IN ORDER FOR US TO STICK INSIDE THE BASE OF THE STAGE
SO WE PUT IT IN HIGH ENOUGH SO THAT IT CREATES IT WILL BE STURDY IT WILL CREATE A NICE BASE AND WE SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH LEFT OUT TO BE ABLE TO STICK INTO THE BASE OF THE STAGE
IT KIND OF CREATES A NICE FOUNDATION AND BASE
MAINLY BECAUSE THE NONMETAL OR BASE METAL IS GOING TO CAUSE CORROSION
FIRST OF ALL YOU WANT TO START WITH A GOOD BASE
YOU CAN CHOOSE ANY METAL FRAME YOU WANT AS LONG AS THE BASE OF THE BED HAS A CENTER SUPPORT SYSTEM UNDERNEATH IT
I GET A SMALL BASE
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS WITH REALLY WIDE FEET BECAUSE IF I NEED TO MOVE MY BODY AROUND I NEED TO HAVE SOME MOBILITY WITH ME SO I GET KIND OF A NARROW BASE
BY USING A PROTEIN BASE CONDITION IT'S GOING TO EVEN OUT THE PROCESS OF YOUR HAIR
NOW ONE OF THE KEY TRAITS THAT ALL GOOD FIRST AND THIRD BASE COACHES HAVE IS THAT THEY'RE VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND THEY'RE VERY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THEY SAY
SO LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE YOU'VE GOT A GUY ON FIRST BASE AND YOU TELL HIM FREEZE ON A LINE
NOW WHAT IT HAS IS IT HAS A CONDENSER MOTOR IN THE BASE OF THE REFRIGERATOR AND IT WILL BE IN THE BACK HERE
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GRAB THE BASE OF THE BODY AND THE PANTS TOGETHER AS WELL AS THE BACK OF THE NECK OF YOUR SCARECROW AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO PUT HIM IN YOUR CHAIR LET HIM SLIDE DOWN AND IF YOU HAVE HIM STUFFED PROPERLY HE'S JUST GOING TO STAND UP ON HIS OWN AND YOU HAVE YOUR HEAD PINNED ON SECURELY THAT'S GOING TO STAND UP AS WELL
BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY THESE ORNAMENTS ON A SECONDARY MARKET OR USED ON THE YEAR IT WASN'T PUT OUT IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO USE THIS AS A BASE WHEN YOU BUY YOUR ORNAMENTS
USING YOUR FINGER UNDERNEATH AS A BASE SO THAT THE BRAID DOESN'T MOVE AND STAYS FLAT
LET ME GET A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT AND AS COMPARED TO AN UNTREATED PIECE OF WOOD USING AN OIL BASE STAIN
NOW A CARTWHEEL IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S A BASE FUNDAMENTAL TO BUILD ON AND GET YOUR CONFIDENCE SET FOR DOING ANY SORT OF TUMBLE AT ALL
WRAP IT AROUND THE BASE
I'M GOING TO BUILD A CONE AND USING YOUR HAND FORMING TECHNIQUE KEEPING THE BASE WIDER THAN THE TOP
LONGFIN DAMSELFISH HAVE DORSAL AND ANAL FINS THAT EXTEND WELL BEYOND THE BASE OF THE TAIL AND USUALLY ARE MORE POINTED THAN ROUNDED
START WITH A BASE COAT THAT IS RECOMMENDED FOR YOUR TYPE OF NAIL
IF IT'S A DRY NAIL USE A POLISH A BASE COAT DESIGNED FOR DRY NAILS
I'M GOING TO NEED SOME WHITE THICK BASE PAINT
IF YOU SCROLL DOWN YOU'LL SEE YOU'RE GIVEN A BASE PRICE AND A TOTAL PRICE WITH A LOW RETAIL AND AN AVERAGE RETAIL NUMBER
A CUTICLES PUSHER I HAVE THREE TYPES RIGHT HERE NAIL CLIPPERS CUTICLES CLIPPERS YOU WOULD ALSO NEED YOUR POLISHES THE SHADE THAT YOU DESIRE THE BASE COAT AND YOUR TOP COAT
SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IN THAT CASE IS TAKE THE STEM OUT OF THE VASE AND GIVE IT ANOTHER FRESH CUT SO THAT YOU'RE OPENING UP THE BASE OF THE STEM AGAIN AND IT'S DRINKING THE WATER O.K
SO REMEMBER THAT BEING A CLEAR COMMUNICATOR IS VERY IMPORTANT TO BEING A BASE COACH
SO I SLIDE UP BASE MY BODY KEEP MY BODY LEVEL HERE KEEP MY HANDS UP THROW THE RIGHT LEG LEAD SIDE KICK STEP FORWARD SHIFT REVERSE PUNCH TURN THE FOOT OUT
YOU HAVE ONE DOWN AT THE BASE OF THE SPINE THAT'S RED
NOW WE'RE GOING TO APPLY THE WHITE BASE PAINT TO THE BOXES
BUT SINCE WE'RE GOING TO ATTACH THESE TO A BASE
AND IT GIVES IT A GOOD BASE AND FOUNDATION WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT
NOW WITH THE OPEN PART POINTED TOWARDS YOU THIS WILL BECOME THE TOP TRIANGLE WILL BECOME THE BASE OF THE FLOWER
VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEM HAVE ARE VENEERED AND THESE CURVES AND OFTEN WITH MAHOGANY OR ROSEWOOD USUALLY ON A PINE BASE
WE HAVE GOT SOME BASE VEGETABLE BASE FOR OUR RICE WE ARE GOING TO NEED SOME OIL SOME GARLIC SOME RICE VINEGAR SALT AND PEPPER REGULAR WHITE VINEGAR AND SOME SOY SAUCE
THIS IS WHEN THE BATTER SWINGS THE BAT AND MAKES CONTACT WITH THE CATCHER'S GLOVE OR THE CATCHER GETS IN THE WAY SOMEHOW OF THE BATTER SO HE DOES GET ON BASE
YOU STILL DENOTE THAT WITH AN INT BUT YOU DRAW YOUR LINE ADVANCING FROM HOME TO FIRST BASE
SO I'M STARTING AT THE BASE OF HER LASHES AND THEN WORKING MY WAY UP TO THE ENDS
AND I HAVE FOUND THAT I CAN SIT DOWN WITH A CHILD AND I CAN JUST USING THE ALPHABET OK AS OUR BASE OF OPERATIONS
NOW AS YOU CAN SEE WE ARE CREATING THE FOLD BASE ON THE INSIDE HERE
IF WE MOVE TO THE NEXT MEASURE WE HAVE AN F AND WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE BASE CLEF AND THE BASE CLEF HAS THE DOT ABOVE AND BELOW F LINE SO THAT IS A DEAD GIVE A WAY IF YOU WANT TO TRY YOUR GOOD BOYS DOES FINE ALWAYS AND IT WILL ALSO BRING YOU TO F ANYWAY HERE'S F AND THE VERY NEXT NOTE IS F WITH A SHARP SYMBOL IN FRONT OF IT
AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO START OFF WITH OUR BIRD BASE
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE WE'RE GOING TO START WITH A SQUARE PIECE OF PAPER AND ITS ALREADY PRE-CREASED FOR THE BIRD BASE SO YOU CAN JUST GO THROUGH THIS RATHER QUICKLY
AND TO GO IN TO OUR BIRD BASE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THESE FLAPS HERE AND FOLD THEM IN TO THE CENTER LINE THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN CREATED HERE FROM OUR PREVIOUS FOLDS
NOW WHAT I LIKE TO DO IT PUT MY HAND ON THE FLOOR OR CURVE IT AROUND THE BASE OF THE BOSU OR THE BALANCE TRAINER
IN A BASE PERIOD WE DO MORE EXTENSIVE ENDURANCE WHICH CAN BE DONE ON A ROAD BIKE AS WELL YOU DON'T GET THE SKILL DEVELOPMENT PIECE
THE PAPILLA IS THE BASE OF YOUR HAIR FOLLICLE AND AS YOUR BLOOD PASSES THROUGH IT GRABS ALL THE NUTRIENTS IT NEEDS IN ORDER TO GROW YOUR HAIR
PAINTING EDGES ON THE DOOR THE DOOR JAMS ARE A LITTLE EASIER THEN DOING BASE BOARDS OR NOT AS DIRTY BUT REMEMBER WHEN YOU GET DOWN THERE NEAR THE FLOOR THERE WOULD BE SOME DIRT THAT YOU MIGHT PICK UP SO BE SURE TO CLEAN THAT OFF REALLY GOOD
THIS IS A FROG BASE
THIS IS A FAIRLY SIMPLE MODEL IF YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE A FROG BASE
SO STARTING WITH A FROG BASE WE ARE GOING TO FOLD EACH OF THESE TRIANGLES DOWN LIKE THIS
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT CURRY IS BUT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT IS THE BASE OF A CURRY
YOU ALSO MAY HAVE A PERSON WHO USE A LITTLE MORE RED OR A LITTLE MORE SWELLING UNDER THE EYE SO THAT IT USUALLY WOULD BE UNDER THE LASH LINE THE LOWER LASH LINE SO YOU WOULD WANNA USE A GREEN BASE THERE
TWELVE IS A GOOD NUMBER FOR YOUR BASE RING
SO YOU'RE GOING TO BRING IT UP TO THE BASE OF THE HEAD BRING IT DOWN
OPEN IT UP AND WE ARE GOING TO DO A SWIVEL FOLD BY PINCHING THE BASE OF THE TAIL TOGETHER WE ARE GOING TO FOLD IT AT AN ANGLE DOWN LIKE SO
HOLDING IT SO THAT THE SINK FOLD IS ON THE BOTTOM THAT'S THE BASE OF OUR HORSE WE ARE GOING TO OPEN THE TAIL THE POINT THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LITTLE TRIANGLE FOLDED DOWN
SAME THING AS WE DID WITH THE TAIL DO A CRIMP FOLD WITH THE BASE OF THE HEAD SWIVEL FOLDS ON BOTH SIDES
YOU REALLY DON'T WANT A LEFT FIELDER PLAYING SECOND BASE
TO GO IN TO OUR BIRD BASE WE'LL JUST GO AHEAD AND OPEN THIS UP AND PULL THIS BACK LIKE SO
I'M GOING TO USE THE SAME COLOR AS I USED AS BASE THAT LIGHT PINKY SILVER COLOR AND I'M GOING TO USE THAT JUST A LITTLE DEEPER UNDERNEATH THE BROW AND ALSO IN THE INSIDE CORNER OF THE EYE JUST TO ADD SOME HIGHLIGHT TO THE EYE AND THIS IS GOING TO REALLY OPEN THE EYE AND MAKE IT LOOK FULL AND FINISH OFF THE LOOK
AND I'M GOING TO DRAW SORT OF THE BIG PIECES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT LIKE SAY THE EXHAUST PIPE WHICH WILL COME RIGHT ALONG THE BASE AND THEN COME UP AND OUT
WIDE BASE ARMS OUT ESTABLISH CONTACT LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY BALL COMES OFF YOU'RE AT LEAST TWO FEET AWAY FROM THE RIM ESTABLISH CONTACT FIRST THEN AGGRESSIVELY GET THE BASKETBALL
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS GO AHEAD AND SELECT PORTRAIT AS MY BASE STYLE
WHAT I LIKE TO SAY TO THE STUDENTS IS THINK OF A BASE OF A TRIANGLE AND YOU WANT TO GET THE BALL RIGHT OVER YOUR HEAD TO THE A PASS
WHERE AS THE DUSKY DAMSELFISH FINS AND JUST ADD OR JUST PASSED THE BASE OF THE TAIL AND ARE ROUNDED
SO WHEN I HAVE TO APPLY A CORRECTIVE BASE I CHOOSE A COLOR THAT HAS A BLUE BASE
AND THAT ASH BASE WILL THEN COUNTERACT THAT WARMTH IN YOUR HAIR AND MAKE A NICE NEUTRAL COLOR
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO CHOOSE MAYBE AN ASH BASE
NOW I'M GOING TO TAKE MY HARD RIB I'M GOING TO PUSH IN AT THE BASE I'M GOING TO THIN THIS OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE UNTIL IT'S ABOUT THE HEIGHT I'M LOOKING FOR
IN THIS NEXT STEP WE ARE GOING TO CREATE THE OUTER PETALS OF OUR FLOWER FOR THE POLYMER CLAY BASE
SO LET'S SEE I WOULD PROBABLY GO WITH SOMETHING A LITTLE YELLOW BASE I'M KIND OF IN BETWEEN THERE
SO YOU CAN SEE WE'RE MISSING THE BOTTOM AND WE'RE MISSING THE BACK BUT WITH THIS PIECE ONCE WE REFINISH THE FOOD IT'S VERY EASY TO COME BACK AND CUT SOME BACK PIECES AND THEN COVER THOSE WITH SOME KIND OF A FABRIC AND SOME PADDING TO CREATE A NEW BASE
THE ROUND BASE CAN REALLY TIP A LOT
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I FEED A LITTLE BIT WIDER RIGHT HERE HE'LL STEP IN HIS RIGHT LEG COMES AROUND NOW HE IS AT A STRONG BASE TO RECOVER BACK
AND THEN YOU LET IT REST ON THE LITTLE BASE AND STAND THERE
THERE IS A CLASP ON THE BACK FOR TIGHTENING AND YOU WANT IT TO SIT AT THE BASE OF THE SKULL FAIRLY SNUG
THESE ARE TRIMMING TOOLS WE WILL USE THESE ONCE THE BOWL HAS DRIED OUT AND WE'LL FLIP IT OVER AND USE THESE TO TRIM THE FOOT ON THE BASE OF IT

SERPENT KUNDALINI IS SAID TO METAPHORICALLY RESIDE AT THE BASE OF THE SPINE COILED THREE AND A HALF TIMES AROUND THE ROOT CHAKRA
FOR INSTANCE TO STAY AT HOME MORE TO LET THE HOME BECOME A HOME BASE AND LET EVERYTHING COME OUT FROM THE HOME
BUT TWELVE FOR THIS MEDIUM WEIGHT YARN IS A GOOD NUMBER FOR OUR BASE CIRCLE SO IT CAN CONTINUE
BUT TODAY WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS MORE ON THE SOFTER MORE GENTLE SAUCES ALONG WITH OUR COCONUT BASE
SO NEXT I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO TRIM A FOOT ON THE BASE OF YOUR MUG
NOW I'M NOT SO WORRIED ABOUT THE TEXTURE UNDERNEATH OF THE MASKING TAPE AND THE WHITE BASE PAINT WHICH ALSO WENT ON KIND OF THICK BECAUSE THE TEXTURE IS KIND OF A I KIND OF LIKE HAVING A THE LITTLE BIT OF TEXTURE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PICTURE FRAME
NOW THAT THE COAT OF BASE PAINT THAT I'VE PUT ON HAS DRIED I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND COLOR THE PICTURE FRAME WITH MY YELLOW ACRYLIC PAINT
THIS WORKS GREAT LIKE I SAID PLUS IF YOU PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD USE WD FORTY IT'S A PETROLEUM BASE IT WILL USUALLY CLEAN UP AND I'VE ALSO BEEN TOLD IT WILL CLEAN UP IF YOUR CAR GETS HIT WITH SPRAY PAINT
THESE ARE PRETTY BASE HEAVY MONITORS AND THESE ARE PRETTY FLAT MONITORS THAT I USE TO MIX
ONCE YOU BUILD YOUR BASE YOU CAN BEGIN TO ADD ON THE TOP OF IT BY USING JUST HAND FORMING PACKING PILES OF SAND ON THE SIDES
A GOOD UTILITY MAN LIKE WILSON BEDEMONT FOR THE NY YANKEES IS ABLE TO FILL IN AT THIRD BASE HE'S ABLE TO FILL IN AT SHORTSTOP SECOND BASE SOMETIMES SPELL THE FIRST BASEMAN

I UNDID THE BASE OF THE SAW BLADE
WHAT I'M GOING TO BE DOING IS I WILL OPEN UP THE SAW ITSELF THE BLADE ITSELF AND REMOVE IT FROM ONE END THE BASE END AND THAT WILL BE FED INTO A HOLE AND THEN I WILL PLACE IT BACK INTO THE HOLDER AGAIN THE SAW BLADE AND THEN TIGHTEN IT UP
SO THESE ARE JUST A FEW DIFFERENT TYPE OF TOOLS THAT YOU CAN USE WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO CONCEAL AND BASE ON HOW MUCH COVERAGE YOU NEED OR WHAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE IN WORKING WITH THAT WILL LEAD YOU TO WHAT TYPE OF TOOL THAT YOU NEED TO USE
