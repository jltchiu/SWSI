IF SHE GETS KNOCKED DOWN SHE COULD GET HURT BUT RAVEN MIGHT NOT ACTUALLY HAVE THE SENSE AT THIS AGE TO KNOW THAT SHE'S CAN'T PLAY WITH HANNAH THE WAY THAT SHE PLAYS WITH HER OTHER BUDDIES
AS FAR AS CATS ARE CONCERNED THEY HAVE A TENDENCY TO BE DESTRUCTIVE AT THIS AGE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SHARPEN THEIR CLAWS AND EVERYTHING
YOU COULDN'T ASK FOR A DOG THAT WOULD BE BETTER WITH PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE BETTER WITH YOU WITH YOUR FAMILY BUT THEY HAVE TO BE SOCIALIZED FROM A VERY EARLY AGE AND FROM A VERY EARLY AGE SOCIALIZED WITH OTHER DOGS
BUT I THINK ANYTHING YOU DO OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM YOU CAN BRING INTO THE CLASSROOM IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WE'RE TEACHING THE BASICS OF LIFE EVERY DAY IN THE ELEMENTARY AGE STUDENT
A DOG GETS ALL OF ITS TEETH AT ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS OF AGE SO THIS DOG SINCE NOT ALL OF ITS TEETH ARE COMPLETELY IN THIS DOG IS JUST A LITTLE BIT UNDER SEVEN MONTHS OF AGE SO THAT GIVES US A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT THE AGE RANGE OF THIS DOG IS SO ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS OF AGE
THE TEETH ARE A CLUE FOR AGE IN A PUPPY
THE FIRST STEP TO DIRECTING A LOCAL PAGEANT IS GETTING THE AGE GROUP THAT YOU WANNA DO
IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO MULTIPLE AGE GROUPS YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER THE CATEGORIES OF THE AGE GROUPS
NOW YOU CAN EITHER HAVE AN ASSORTMENT OF AGE GROUPS OR YOU CAN FOCUS ON ONE AGE GROUP THAT IS UP TO YOU AS A PAGEANT DIRECTOR
YOU CAN HAVE THEM ALL THE WAY FROM BABIES TO HIGH SCHOOL AGE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOCAL PAGEANT
THIS IS EXCLUDING A FRANCHISE WHEN YOU GET INTO THE COLLEGE AGE CONTESTANTS
YOU HAVE TO HAVE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS YOU HAVE TO BE A CERTAIN AGE THEY DO REQUIRE COLLEGE AND/OR SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERIENCE
NOW I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ON HOW TO SELECT A FRAME THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO AGE
BUT ONE THING YOU WANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS WHEN YOU USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT HAS A SLOPED BACK YOU HAVE TO COME AROUND THE SIDE AND AGE ALL OF THIS
AGAIN A PUERH IS A FERMENTED TEA THAT'S IN AGE FOR THIRTY YEARS
NOW FOR MANY PEOPLE ITS UNNATURAL TO TRY TO PLAY A HORN WHILE STANDING BECAUSE FROM A EARLY AGE HORN PLAYERS ARE ALWAYS THOUGHT TO KEEP THERE BELL ON THERE THIGH WHEN THE ARE SITTING DOWN
THE PLACE THAT I'D LIKE TO START WHEN DOING BACK FLOATS WITH CHILDREN KYLE'S AGE AND A LITTLE BIT YOUNGER IS TO GO AHEAD AND USE THE STEPS
AS WE AGE WE LOSE FLEXIBILITY
AND THEN AS YOU AGE YOU START TO LOSE THAT ABILITY TO REACH ALL THE WAY DOWN TO YOUR TOES LIKE YOU COULD WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG
REMEMBER THIS IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO AT HOME ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE AT A YOUNG AGE AND THEY DON'T NEED A WHOLE LOT OF UPKEEP
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THIS BOX IS AS BIG AS THIS KITTEN SO IT WOULDN'T BE APPROPRIATE FOR THIS AGE OF A KITTY
SO YOU'RE REALLY GETTING NEAR FORTY YEARS OF AGE BEFORE YOU GET YOUR FIRST JOB
SO WE'LL WORK WITH CONVENIENCE STORES AND OTHER SUPPLIERS TO WHERE WE'LL ACTUALLY PUT LITTLE STICKERS THAT SAYS JUST A LITTLE REMINDER SAYS DON'T PROVIDE ALCOHOL TO SOMEONE UNDER THE AGE OF 21
ALSO THE ART STYLE WE WERE GOING FOR WAS MORE OF THE 70'S VIBE MORE OF A SILVER AGE LOOK
AT A YOUNG AGE WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE PINKIES
THEY KIND OF HAVE THE JET STREAM LOOK TO THEM KIND OF SPACE AGE LOOK TO THEM BUT THEY WERE ONLY MADE FROM SAY 1955 TO 1965 SO THE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION THAT GOT ONE OF THESE FOR CHRISTMAS OR RODE THEM ON THEIR PAPER ROUTE IT'S A MUCH SMALLER SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION
MOST KIDS THAT AGE ARE GOING TO TRY TO TEAR UP THE MASK AND MAKES FOR A FAIRLY UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE ALL THE WAY AROUND
NOW THERE ARE VARIOUS METHODS OF DELIVERY ONCE YOU HAVE THE MEDICATION IN THERE AGAIN DEPENDING ON THE AGE OF THE PERSON
YOU KNOW WHAT I DO WHEN I MEET CHILDREN IF THEY ARE AROUND AN AGE WHEN I KNOW THEY MIGHT BE LEARNING ABOUT THE ALPHABET I ASK THEM THIS BIG IMPORTANT QUESTION
NOW YOU CAN MAKE THIS AGE APPROPRIATE FOR ANY AGE TO A YOUNG CHILD TO AN ADULT
WELL SOME OF IT DEPENDS ON THE BREED BUT MOSTLY IF YOU'VE GOT A DOG WHO'S SEVEN YEARS OF AGE IN HUMAN TERMS OR OLDER YOU'VE GOT A GERIATRIC DOG
ANOTHER CAUSE OF CONCERN IS THAT THE CDC DID A RANDOM SAMPLE OF ADULT WOMEN OF CHILD BEARING AGE AND FOUND THAT A LOT OF THEM HAD I THINK IT WAS OVER SEVENTY PERCENT HAD MORE THAN THE RECOMMENDED LEVEL OF PHTHALATES CIRCULATING IN THEIR BLOODSTREAM
DEPENDING ON WHICH AGE OF KIDS AND HOW YOU WANT TO WORK THE PROJECT YOU CAN USE A PAINT BRUSH OR YOU CAN HAVE THEM SMEAR THE GLUE WITH THEIR FINGER
ANOTHER VACCINATION THAT WE GIVE TO CATS DEPENDING ON THEIR AGE AND IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE INDOOR/OUTDOOR IS DISTEMPER WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY AN EASY TERM OF UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS IN CATS
