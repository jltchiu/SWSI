WE HAVE DBL NOTCH LP NOTCH AND LP FAT
ALRIGHT SO WHENEVER WE ARE DOING ANY EXERCISE WHERE WE REALLY WANT TO SLIM DOWN OR TRIM DOWN THE FAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS FOCUS ON CARDIO AS WELL
WHAT IT DOES IS THE FAT RISES TO THE TOP AND ALL THE JUICES SIT AT THE BOTTOM
AND YOUR FAT ALL STAYS AT THE TOP
AND THEN YOU CAN JUST POUR YOUR JUICES WITHOUT THE FAT INTO YOUR PAN
I'VE GOT ALL THESE GORGEOUS JUICES BUT I ALSO HAVE A LOT OF FAT IN THERE FROM THE CHICKEN
SO BASICALLY YOUR BODY MASS INDEX IS FIGURED UP FROM YOUR HEIGHT AND YOUR WEIGHT AND HOW MUCH OF THAT IS BODY FAT
I AM HERE IN SALT LAKE CITY UTAH WITH FAT CATS FAMILY BOWLING CENTER
AND LET THE OTHERS FIGHT OVER THOSE FAT THIRTY POINTS BECAUSE NEGATIVE POINT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THEM
I HAVE OUR CRAW FISH HERE AND I'M GOING TO ADD THIS IN AND THAT IS THE SEASONED CRAW FISH WITH THE FAT AND EVERYTHING A LOT OF FLAVOR SO LETS MIX THE CRAW FISH UP IN THERE
OVERALL TYPICALLY THE RESPONSE OF TONING THIGHS IS TO GIVE THEM MORE MUSCULAR APPEARANCE REMOVING THE BODY FAT
AND THEN MELTED NON TRANS FAT NON LACTOSE SPREAD MADE WITH FLAXSEED OIL YOU CAN FIND IT AT WHOLE FOODS OR AT TRADERS JILL'S OR AT USUALLY AT ANY SPECIALTY HEALTH FOOD MARKET
THOSE HARD FATS YOU KNOW WE MAKE CHOLESTEROL FROM THAT SO IF WE WANT TO KEEP OUR CHOLESTEROL DOWN YOU KNOW WE NEED TO GO WITH THE LOW FAT PROTEINS IN THE DIET LEAN PROTEIN AND EMPHASIZE THE LIQUID FATS THE ESSENTIAL FATS
WELL WE NEED FATS FOR HORMONE PRODUCTION IN THE BODY FATS CUSHION THE ORGANS THE BRAIN IS SIXTY PERCENT FAT IT'S PRIMARILY THE OMEGA-3 FATS SO WE NEED IT FOR GOOD HEART HEALTH
OLIVE OIL IS PAR PRIMARILY WHAT WE CALL OMEGA-9 WHICH IS NOT AN ESSENTIAL FAT BUT NEVERTHELESS IT'S A HEALTHY FAT AND THIS CAN EVEN BE USED FOR LIGHT SAUT ING
YOU'RE JUST GETTING RID OF THAT EXCESS FAT CAUSE YOU REALLY DON'T NEED IT
I'M JUST GOING TO TRIM A LITTLE BIT OF THE FAT JUST TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT HEALTHIER
BUT IN THIS CASE BECAUSE WE GOT THAT BACON FAT IN THERE WE ARE REALLY JUST GOING TO COOK IT FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES AND KEEP STIRRING IT AND I DON'T WON'T TO BURN IT AT ALL OR HAVE IT TAKE ANY COLOR BECAUSE I'VE GOTTEN A LITTLE BIT OF COLOR FROM OUR BACON TO BEGIN WITH AND I LIKE MY COLOR TO BE AS WHITE AS IT CAN BE
I WOULDN'T USE WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR OR BLEACHED UNBLEACHED BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T MAKE THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE SO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS SPRINKLE THIS INTO THE ONIONS AND WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE THAT BACON FAT AND THIS FLOUR COOK
THEY ARE HIGH IN PROTEIN AND LOW IN FAT
THEY ARE LOW IN SATURATED FAT ANYWAYS WHICH IS THE KIND THAT CLOGS YOUR ARTERIES AND YOU WANT TO STAY AWAY FROM
YOU COULD DO A LOW FAT LOW GLYCEMIC MEAL
THERE'S 26 GRAMS OF PROTEIN AND IT'S ONLY FIVE GRAMS OF FAT SO IT'S REALLY GOOD
YET YOU DON'T WANT THE EXCESS SKIN BECAUSE ALL IT DOES IS ADD EXTRA FAT AND GREASE AND WILL REQUIRE MORE SKIMMING
EVEN COCONUT OIL WHICH IS A SATURATED FAT BUT IT IS A HEALTHY OIL HEALTHY FAT AND THIS HELPS US TO MAKE MORE OF THE HEALTHY CHOLESTEROL THE HDL'S
YOU ADD IT TO YOUR FOODS AT THE TABLE AND FLAX IS THE OMEGA-3 FAT
WE ALSO HAVE THE PASTELS THAT ACTUALLY COME IN A PENCIL FORM YOU SHARPEN THESE WITH A REAL PENCIL SHARPENER A FAT ONE FOR ART PENCILS BECAUSE AS YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT FATTER THAN REGULAR PENCILS AND THIS IS THE CLEANEST WAY TO GO
THERE IS A VARIETY OF EXERCISES THAT YOU CAN DO TO INCREASE MUSCULATURE AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO COMBINE THAT WITH YOUR EATING HABITS MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO LOWER YOUR BODY FAT PERCENTAGE SO THAT WHATEVER MUSCULATURE YOU DO GAIN ACTUALLY SHOES
IT LITERALLY JUST MEANS FAT
FAT DOES NOT ACTUALLY STAND FOR ANYTHING
LIKE IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAVE WHEN YOU HAVE FAT ON IT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE IT IS ACTUALLY BEING STRETCHED OUT
SO I LEARNED HOW TO MAKE REALLY HEALTHY DESSERTS USING ALL NATURAL PRODUCTS THEY ARE FAT FREE THEY ARE CHOLESTEROL FREE AND WHAT I HAVE HERE ARE OATMEAL CREAM SANDWICH BARS
AND THEN PUT THAT RIGHT INTO THE BLENDER THAT'S FOUR EGGS NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD A 1/4 CUP OF WATER OUR 1/4 CUP OF OIL THE TRADITIONAL OIL TO USE WOULD BE SHMALTS SHMALTS IS A RENDER CHICKEN FAT IT'S NOT SO HEALTHY SO I LIKE TO USE A MIXTURE OF OLIVE OIL AND CANOLA OIL IT'S TWO TABLESPOONS OF OLIVE OIL AND TWO TABLESPOONS OF CANOLA OIL
HAMBURGER MEAT IS HIGH IN FAT
I'M HERE WITH FAT CATS FAMILY BOWLING CENTER IN SALT LAKE CITY UTAH
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THIS CARAMEL COLOR HERE AGAIN THIS IS JUST FROM THE FAT CARAMELIZING THE IN MEAT
THERE'S NO REMOVING THE FAT CAP ON THIS KIND OF MEAT IT'S JUST GOING TO FALL RIGHT A PART LIKE THAT
WHEN I STARTED LEARNING CLUBS I ACTUALLY HAD A FAT LIP FOR THE FIRST TWO WEEKS UNTIL I FIGURED OUT WHAT TO DO
