SO WHEN YOU HIT IT TOSS THE BALL IN FRONT OF YOU TAKE YOUR ARM BACK LEAD WITH YOUR ELBOW AND HIT WITH YOUR HAND OPEN AND OUT IN FRONT OF YOU
HI MY NAME IS BRANDON SARKIS ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE HOLIDAY PUDDING OKAY SO NOW YOU SEE WE'VE GOT THE MIXTURE THAT LOOKS LIKE A LIKE THEM UP AND THAT ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO DO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR MOLASSES NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD ALL OF THAT IN THAT ONE AND THEN WITH THE FAT OR THAT THAT DOESN'T THAT TYPE OF FLOUR ON ALL READY BECAUSE ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE AND IF THIS WERE DIFFERENT INGREDIENT THAT ONE WAS DEFINITELY GET A DIFFERENT BATCH OF A LIST OF ALL THAT IN THERE IS THE YOU KNOW ALL ITS SPECIALIST TOUCHES EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE IN OR IN PRODUCT THAT REALLY MAKE THE THE OR IF YOU'RE GOING TO ROLL THE LEFT AS WE GO THAT IS ALL ABOUT THE LEFT WITH NO GOOD WITH THE BALL BACK UP AND SLOWLY STIR THAT IN AND OUT OF THIS KIND OF A GOOFY THAT IT IS GOING TO END UP LOOKING LIKE A KIND OF LIKE A REALLY DARK FAKE RUNNY LIKE PAIN CAKE BATTER ON FOR THREE STRAIGHT TEXTURE TO TURN A LITTLE BIT OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING LET THIS GO UNTIL THERE ARE NO WANT IT TO PROBABLY TAKE SEVERAL MINUTES SO I'LL COME BACK WITH THREE THAT POINT AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT TO THINK THAT IF YOU MISS YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT NO ONE SO THERE WE GO NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IS I WANT IT STRAIGHT DOWN TO REALLY SLOWLY AND THE MILK AND TALKING LIKE AND TRIPLE FOR AND WITH THIS IS DOING IS
BALL COMES OUT OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEY DON'T GET THE FILE CALLED BECAUSE THE THE THE PLAYER THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO BOX OUT IS EASILY ABLE TO GET THE REBOUND
MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH SPACE IN BETWEEN YOURSELF IN THE RIM SO WHEN THE BALL COMES OFF THE REBOUND EASILY
SO MOST OF THEM ARE EQUIPPED WITH LIKE A BALL BEARING TYPE SWIVEL AT THE VERY END SO THAT MAKES A LITTLE BIT FASTER AND THE JUMP ROPE ITSELF DOESN'T GET BALLED UP INSIDE THE HANDLE
YOUR KNEELING HANDS GET PLACED ON THE BALL KIND OF LIKE A KARATE CHOP I'M GOING TO PUSH THE BALL OUT BENDING AT THE HIPS AND THEN USING THE ELBOWS TO DRIVE THE BALL IN TO THE SIDE AND BACK UP
A NEED EIGHT BALL TO HIDE BEHIND TYPE OF DESIGN AND FACES OFF
SO THAT TELLS US WITH THE BALL KAYAK EITHER NEEDS A NEW WASHER AND NEEDS TO BE REBUILT OR WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT
SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE WHERE TO GO UNDERNEATH WE HAVE ALREADY HAVE A SHUT THE WATER OFF WE'RE DISCONNECTING THE SUPPLY LINE AND THE BOTTOM OF THE BALL CUT
AND GET THEM ON AND DO THE BALL DOWN THAT THAT HOLDS THE BALL BACK TO THE TANK
OKAY THE NEXT CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SCORING YOUR YOUR POINT SO YOUR BALLS TO TO MOVE FORWARD SO EVENTUALLY SINK THE EIGHT BALL WIN THE GAME
WE KNOW THAT IF YOU MAKE A LEGAL SHOT YOU GET TO SCORE AGAIN AND GETTING TO NEW TO KEEP PLAYING SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A SCENARIO WHERE I'M STRIPES AND THIS TWO BALLS LEFT THAT I'M STILL SHOOTING I COULD DO SOMETHING WHERE I CALL THE TWELVE BALL IN THE CORNER AND TRY TO STOP THE CUE BALL HERE BECAUSE AGAIN THESE ARE GOOD AS YOU LEARN FULL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN POSITIONING AND AGAIN THIS IS A DIFFERENT VIDEO WE ARE JUST LEARNING ABOUT THIS STRATEGY OF THE GAME AND TRY TO WIN THE GAME BUT ALL I WOULD MAKE THE TWELVE THE TEN AND NOW ALL MY BALLS ARE DONE
SCORING JUST MEANS THAT YOU HAVE YOU KNOW THE THE THE BALL THE SEVEN BALLS IN THE STRIPES ALL THE SEVEN BALLS IN THE SOLIDS
I'M TRYING TO GET THAT EIGHT BALL BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU WHEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE A LEGAL SHOT
OKAY SO THIS IS ABOUT HOW YOU SHOULD BE TURNED WHEN YOU HIT THE BALL
SO THE HIP SHOULDER TURN IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GOING TO HIT THE BALL STRAIGHT TRUE AND FAR
SO YOU WANT TO HAVE YOU WANT TO PUT TWO BALL SO WHERE YOU CAN GET IT KIND OF QUICK AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BOTHER YOU DOING THE POINT
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO PICK UP A BALL AND COME BACK TO YOUR SECOND SERVE
THE SURFACE THAT'S THE POINT AND YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO TENSES TO PUT THE BALL INSIDE THIS SMALL SQUARE OF CAUSE YOU INSIDE THE SERVICE LINE
AND NUMBER SEVEN IF YOU TURN IT OVER BEFORE THAT CLUB HEAD HITS THE BALL YOU'RE GOING TO HOOK
NUMBER THREE IF YOU GET YOUR HANDS IN FRONT OF THE BALL
NOW BEFORE IF YOU PLAY THE BALL A LITTLE FURTHER BACK IN YOUR STANCE
NOW WATCH THE BLUE BALL
THEN WHEN YOU ADD THE THIRD BALL YOUR COLUMNS OVER
HERE IS ONLY THE BLUE BALL IS DOING A REVERSE CASCADE
THAT'S THE A TRIPLE BALL SHOT ALL OF IT
SO IT'S LIKE THROWING A DARK THEORETICALLY IF YOU CAN GET THAT BALL TO A NICE LOFT
I'M GOING TO REALLY LOOSE OF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR FEET YOUR KNEES BENT AND JUST NICE AND RELAXED AND JUST GET UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND LET THE CLUB DO THE WORK AND YOU'LL HAVE GREAT SUCCESS
SEE THE HOLES IN THE BOTTOM UNEXPLAINABLE LITTLE BIT MORE BEFORE THERE YOU GO TO PUT THE SHEESH RIGHT THERE WHEN THE HE COULD STRONG THROUGH PULLS THE SHE SHOW THROUGH THOSE HOLES THROUGH THE NEW GROWTH SO ON THIS TINY LITTLE BALL
IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO OUT BY A HOOK UP AND YOU'RE GOING TO LOAD YOUR FIRST BALL SOME OF THE BALLS YOU MIGHT GET LOOK LIKE THIS THAT EXAMPLE AT THE TOP ON IT LIKE THAT BUT YOU CAN PUT YOUR LITTLE TOP ON IT JUST KEEPS THE ASH IN AND IT KEEPS THE HEAT AND AS WELL
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE GOING TO AGAIN YOU CAN EXTEND OUT YOU CAN EXPECT TO PAINT A HOOP A BAR YOU CAN EXPECT TO PAY ABOUT THEM ANYWHERE FROM TEN TO ABOUT FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR THE BALL YOU SMOKE
BUT YOU'RE CONSIDERING YOUR OTHER OPTION IS REALLY A A SILICONE JUGGLING BALL THAT RUN ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY TO FIFTY DOLLARS A PIECE
AND WE'LL MIX THIS UP REAL WELL AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A GREAT DRINK FOR THE BALL NICE COLD AUTUMN DAY MAYBE SET YOURSELF UP WITH A CAPTAIN MORGAN STEAM THE APPLES CLOSET DRINK IN AND MAKE THE BEAUTIFUL EVENING THAT MUCH BETTER
ANOTHER THING WE CAN DO IS STANDING BEHIND THE BALL JUST WORKING ON OUR VERTICAL LEAP
AS WELL YOU CAN JUMP OVER THE BALL AND BACK BEHIND THE BALL AND OVER THE BALL AND BEHIND THE BALL
YOU STEP OVER AND JUMPING OVER THE BALL JUST AS IF YOU'RE JUMPING OVER DEFENDERS YOU'RE GOING DOWN THE FIELD
AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUSH BACK PRESSING AGAINST THE INFLATED BALL THEN RELAXING THE SHOULDERS AND BACK FORWARD
I'M GOING TO PUSH BACK IT'S A VERY SMALL MOVEMENT AND THEN COME FORWARD KEEP YOUR BACK NICE AND STRAIGHT AND PUSH BACK GETTING THAT RESISTANCE OF THE BALL BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES AND THEN COME FORWARD
OKAY IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO BE USING A ON INFLATABLE BALL HELP STRENGTHEN THE LOW BACK
WE WANT TO REMAIN ON THE BALL THE FOOT AND NOT FLAT HEEL
AND WHAT THIS ALLOWS TO HAPPEN IS IN A LOT OF CASES WHEN IT'S A RUN BALL HE'S GOING TO BLOW THIS MAN OUT AND THE RUNNING BACK SHOULD HAVE THE SMART TO GO OFF OF HIS BUT
MY NAME IS SCOTT MCKAY AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO PAINT BALL PAINT OFF OF YOUR VEHICLE
IT BRINGS THE BALL OF THE FOREARM RIGHT UNDERNEATH MY LEG
TO START WITH YOUR FEET ARE AT A SHOULDER DISTANCE YOU'RE GOING TO TURN YOUR BODY TO THE RIGHT AS YOU'RE TURNING TO THE RIGHT YOUR RIGHT HEEL TURNS AND YOUR LEFT FOOT TURNS ON THE BALL THE FOOT
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS HAVE YOUR PANTS AND YOUR FINGER SPREAD APART ON THE BALL LEFT HAND GUIDING THE BALL SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE IF YOU'VE GOT YOUR BALL TOWARDS THE BASKET
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS WHEN YOU LIFT UP YOUR BEND THE LEGS AND YOU MOVE UP WITH THE BALL WITH THIS HAND YOU GUIDE IT SO IT IS A GO IN ANY OTHER DIRECTION BESIDES AN ACTION THAT YOU'RE GOING IN TOWARDS YOU MOVE THE BALL UP AND YOU ROLL IT WITH YOUR FINGERS
THIS ALLOWS YOU TO GO WITH THE BALL OF YOUR RACKET EDGE AND KIND OF BRUSH THE BALL YOU TO JUST SIT
BALL GOES HERE THIS GUY DRIBBLES IT THIS GUY STAYS BEHIND YOU GET THE DEFENSE TO COMMIT HERE REVERSE THE BALL TO THIS GUY
WE GOT THE BALL TAKING THAT WE'VE GOT THE GUY TAKEN THE BALL OUT OF BOUNDS
AND IT WILL SOAK DOWN THROUGH THE ROOT BALL DEEP AND SLOW
SO YOU ALSO WANT TO SCORE YOUR CLAY BALL REALLY WELL
JUST PUT A SMALL PALM BALL AND THE QUICK MIX FROM
REMEMBER TO HIT A LITTLE EXTRA DISTANCE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU DRAW THE BALL
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT A LOT OF BEGINNING PLAYERS DO THAT REALLY IS NOT PROPER IS PUTTING THE CUE BALL TOO FAR BACK WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TOO MUCH DISTANCE TO TRAVEL FROM THAT POINT UP TO THERE
WE DON'T WANT TO USE IN THE ENGLISH SQUIRT CUE BALL OFF ONE SIDE OF THE OTHER
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS BALL COMING UP OFF THE TABLE AND WE WANT IT TO GO STRAIGHT DOWN HERE
WE WANT TO CONTACT THAT BALL FALL AND WE WANT TO HIT IT AS FAST AS WE CAN
OKAY YOU STARTED OFF THE EXACT SAME WAY YOU START TO FIX THAT BALL
BUT THIS IS REALLY GOOD PRACTICE RIGHT HERE BECAUSE NOW WE'RE GOING TO KICK IT THE BALL
SO WE'RE BACK TO IDENTIFYING OUR ANGLE INTO THE CUSHION OUT ONCE AGAIN TO HIT THIS BALL
YOU'RE GOING TO OPEN UP INSIDE ARM IS OPEN THE BALL'S GOING TO GO IN YOU'RE GOING TO COVER THE BALL WITH BOTH TIPS AND HOLD ONTO IT TIGHT STAIN LOW IN ORDER TO EXPLODE THROUGH THE HOLE
ONCE THE BALL GOES INSIDE HE WANTS TO WRAP THE BALL UP TIGHT COVER IT WITH BOTH TIPS OVER THE BALL
IF YOU PUT THAT TOGETHER I GUARANTEE YOU ARE GOING TO HOOK THE BALL
BUT THE MAIN THING IS YOU WANT TO READ YOUR DEFENDER AND FIGURE OUT WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO SHOOT THE BALL AFTER CATCHING IT AND GET IT READY
THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT AND I DON'T SUGGEST THAT YOU PRACTICE IT TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE READY TO JUGGLE SIX BALL BEFORE TRYING THIS TRICK BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO AT LEAST BE ABLE TO FLASH THE BALLS IN ONE HAND TO REALLY DO THIS
NOW THE BALL HERE IS ANOTHER QUICK RELEASE AS POSSIBLE MEANING DON'T TAKE THE BALL HERE AND THEN DROP IT DOWN HERE TO THROW IT
HAVE THE BALL HERE BOOM HA QUICK RELEASE
YOU GUYS THE WATCHED ON OUR WAY HOLDS THE BALL HERE DOESN'T WIND UP THROWS A FROM THERE
TWO HANDS ON THE BALL AND YOU WANT TO KEEP THE BALL IDEALLY UP A BROWN YOUR SHOULDER
YOU DON'T WANT TO CARRY THE BALL DOWN HERE BECAUSE WHAT THAT DOES IS CAUSING YOU TO HAVE A SLOW RELEASE
SO OF WHEN YOU DO THAT WHEN YOU RAISE THE BALL A LITTLE BIT NEXT AND TEST CUTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE THE JOINTS ARE COMPLETELY SEATED DOWN HERE AT THE BOTTOM AND COMPLETELY SEATED HERE
THAT MEANS THAT THE PITCHER'S ON ACTUALLY THROWING THE BALL AND HIT THE BATTER
THIS IS WHEN THE PITCHER THROWS THE BALL WILDLY OUT OF THE CATCHER'S RAIN
SO FIRST OF ALL WHEN THE SHOT GOES UP WE'RE GOING TO NOT LOOK AT THE BALL BUT WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUR MAN
SO IF MY TEAM WHICH IS SERVE THE BALL AND WE GET IT IN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CHORD WE GET IN THE SQUARE IN THE ON THE GROUND WE GET A POINT
AND WHAT WHEN USING THIS TYPE OF SCORING AND THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A POINT IS WHEN YOU SERVE THE BALL
THE ONLY WAY IN TRADITIONAL INSIDE OUT SCORING YOU CAN GET A POINT IS IF YOU SERVE THE BALL
NOW THIS IS WET I WOULD CHANGE THE BALL WITH ONE OF THEM HAVE GONE AND THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS CARRY THAT EXTRA BULB IN MY CARRIED OUT
A TENNIS RACKET THAT IS GOING TO GO ALONG WITH YOUR TENNIS BALL SO YOU CAN HIT THE CAN YOU CAN HIT THE BALL BACK AND FORTH
NOW THE NET THAN THE REST OF THE THINGS YOU NEED ARE NOT QUITE AS ESSENTIAL AS YOUR TENNIS BALL AND TENNIS RACKET
NOW WHEN YOU'RE FIRST TAKING THE BALL OUT YOU WANT TO YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO CROSS THE HALF COURT LINE BEFORE EIGHT TO TEN SECONDS
USED TO BE TEN SECONDS AND MY DAY WHEN I PLAY BUT I'VE SEEN WHERE THEY COUNTED THEY'VE CANDIDATE SO YOU WANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND WHENEVER YOU'RE PLAYING BALL THAT YOU GOT ACROSS THE HALF COURT LINE AND YOU CAN NEVER CAN NEVER PASS IT BACK ACROSS THAT THAT LINES ONCE YOU'VE CROSSED OVER INTO THE OFF IT SO THAT THE THE FRONT COURT
BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO STILL WITH ONE BALL AND WE'RE GOING TO CALL THIS THE ONE BALL ARE
SO GET RID OF THOSE TWO BALLS ONCE AGAIN WE STILL JUST NEED ONE BALL TO GET THIS GOING
REALLY YOU CAN INCORPORATE IT INTO A BALL PATTERN BUT YOU CAN BALANCE ANYTHING YOU WANT IT
SO YOU WANT TO CREATE AS MUCH CLUB HEAD SPEED ON FOR THOSE HIGH HANDICAP PLAYERS WHO HAVE TROUBLE GET THE BALL UP IN THE AIR
THESE HAVE ROTATING CUPS ALL BALL JOINTS
THIS IS A SPEED BALL IN IT
AND THAT'S THE RISK YOU ALWAYS RAWNESS HITTING THE BALL AND GO FOR ONE
NOW WHEN YOU GO ON THE BALL YOU CAN STAY IN YOUR KNEES AND JUST BASICALLY BEND FORWARD ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT NINE SHINING THROUGH THE CROWN OF THE
SO PLEASE IF YOU HAVEN'T TRIED THIS MOVING JUST HAPPENED TO FIND THIS CLIP ON LINE I WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST THAT YOU CHECK OUT THE OTHER CLIPS ON ARM EXTENSIONS FOR I'M EXTENSIONS ON THE BALL TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU MASTER THE MOLDS PROPERTY
OKAY NOW WE HAVE OUR BLANCHED ASPARAGUS TIPS AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT THOSE ASIDE IN A BOWL AND ACTUALLY I NEED TO EMPTY THIS BALL RIGHT NOW
YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP YOUR HAND ON TOP OF IT YOU'RE GOING TO PULL THE BALL BACK
SO AS YOU'RE GOING TO SEE FROM THESE GUYS ARE GOING TO BE DRIBBLING HARD INTO THE DEFENDER AND ONCE THEY FEEL LIKE THAT THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE DRIBBLE ANYMORE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO DRIBBLE IN THEIR GOING TO PULL THE BALL BACK
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP THAT SHIELD UP AS YOU'RE PULLING THE BALL BACK BECAUSE IF NOT YOU PULL THE BALL BACK YOU LEAVE YOURSELF OPENING EXPOSE THE DEFENDER ONLY HAS TO DO STEP THROUGH TAKE THAT BALL IS GOING TO GO DOWN ON THE OTHER END AND SCORE IT
WHEN YOU DO YOU DRIBBLE YOU KEEP THE BALL AND CLOSE TO YOU AND YOU'RE GOING TO STILL YOUR DEFENDER AWAY AND KEEP YOUR SHIELD UP
IN THE WAY THAT YOU USE THIS DRIBBLE IS IF YOU'RE DRIBBLING DOWN THE FLOOR AND YOUR DEFENDER IS CLOSING TIGHT ON YOU AND YOU DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE TO CONTINUE FORWARD WHAT YOU CAN DO IS YOU CAN PULL THE BALL BACK AND GET AWAY FROM YOUR DEFENDER
IF YOU WANT TO CUT THE BALL TO THE LEFT AND A CUTTER FASTBALL POSITION FINGERS ON THE LEFT HALF A BALL TO CREATE SPIN AND MOVEMENT THAT WOULD MAKE THE BALL BASICALLY CURVE TO THE RIGHT
IF YOU WANT TO CUT THE BALL TO THE RIGHT IN YOUR RIGHT HAND A PITCHER YOU WE CUT THE BALL IN HALF AND POSITION BOTH FINGERS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BALL
THE CUTTER IS ACCOMPLISHED BY EITHER CUTTING THE BALL TO THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT
YOU WANT PRESSURE ON THE BALL OF THE FOOT
HITTING DRILLS SO YOU WILL HAVE A CENTER WHO WILL SET THE BALL TO THE HAIR
ONE PASSING THE BALL YOU WANT TO HIT IT BETWEEN YOUR WRIST AND YOUR ELBOW
SO THE TOSS OR WHAT TOSS THE BALL TO THE PASSER PASSER WANTS TO GET BEHIND THE BALL FACE THE TARGET USE THEIR KNEES GET THERE BUT DOWN
SO I'M RIGHT HANDED SO I'M GOING TO STEP FIRST WITH MY RIGHT FOOT TO TAKE A TWO STEP APPROACH RIGHT LEFT BEND DOWN PUT MY HANDS BEHIND ME PALMS FACING UP AND THEN ONCE ON DOWN AND BRING MY HANDS UP TO BRING ME UP HIGHER ABOVE THE GROUND AND I'M GOING TO DROP MY ELBOW LEAD WITH MY LEFT ARM AND SWING THROUGH THE BALL
SO I WAS THE BED BALL CHEST PASS AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO SOME GRIP EXERCISES
WHEN YOU DO CLEAN IS TAKE IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON HIM HOW MUCH YOU'RE FEEDING HIM HOW DIRTY IS BALL GETS SO IT COULD BE EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS IT CHANGES WATER OUT
GET A GOOD THING OF ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS EXERCISE IS YOU'RE ACTUALLY CAUSING YOUR YOUR INNER THIGHS TO CONTRACT AGAINST THE MEDICINE BALL WHICH IS GOING TO ADD AN EXTRA CHALLENGE GOING TO FEEL A LITTLE BIT DEEPER IN YOUR ABDOMINALS
OUR NEXT CLIP IS GOING TO BE STABILIZATION CRUNCHES WITH MEDICINE BALL
NOW IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM HOLDING ON TO THIS BALL YOU CAN ALWAYS CROSS YOUR ANKLES HER CRACKER THAN TRYING TO JUST POSITION YOUR FEET TO HOLD THE MEDICINE BALL
OF COURSE YOU WANT TO GET DOWN NICE AND GENTLY ON THE MAT ROLL DOWN NICE AND SLOW NOW GOING TO TAKE YOUR MEDICINE BALL YOU'RE GOING TO PLACE IT BETWEEN THE THIGH THIS WILL KEEP YOUR FEET AT NINETY DEGREES
GRAB YOUR MEDICINE BALL WITH BOTH HANDS
THIS LITTLE ENERGY BALL IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT
CLIP YOURSELF INTO A TREE OR ALL THE OR SOMETHING AND SOLID SO THAT YOU CAN USE IT AS A BLADE POINT OFF THE SHORE AND THAT WAY NO MATTER HOW MUCH TENSIONS ON THAT ROPE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO LEAN AGAINST THE BALL THOUGH THE TREE USING THAT FLIP LINE AND IS NOT GOING TO GO ANYWHERE
THE MAIN THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON OUR TWO HANDS ON THE BALL
NOW WHEN WE'RE THROWING ARE BALL UP WITH A ONE HANDED TOSS WE'RE JUST GOING UP IN THE AIR
AND A LOT OF TIMES WE THINK THAT GOING OUT TO THE BALL AND BUYING THE NEW TRENDS ENCLOSE OR THE NEW IS STUD JEWELRY OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE IS GOING TO HELP US TO LOOK BETTER WHEN IN FACT IF YOU TAKE THOSE FEW HOURS AWAY FROM SHOPPING AND SAVE YOURSELF ALL THE MONEY AND GET OUT AND DO SOME EXERCISE AND DO SOME HEALTHY COOKING THAT'S ACTUALLY THE BEST WAY TO LOOK MORE FASHIONABLE HEALTHIER YOUNGER AND BETTER
YOU CAN'T BE MOVING THAT BALL AROUND
ANYTIME THAT BALL COMES UP WORDS MOVE IF DEFENSES CATCH IT THAT'S GOING TO BE CALLED AS AN OFF SIDES
SO ONCE YOU GET THAT BALL LOCKED IN READY YOU GOT TO KEEP RIGHT THERE
YOU DEFINITELY CANNOT LIFT THE BALL UP AT ANY POINT IN TIME
THIS GUY'S DRIBBLING THE BALL TO THE MIDDLE C NOW SEES THIS GUY COMMON PASSES HERE
HAVING SWEEPS AND SOUND EFFECTS MOVE ACROSS YOUR STEREO IMAGE HAVING THINGS MOVE UP AND DOWN EVEN AND IT'S ALL THIS SONG ONE BALL
YOU'RE GOING TO DROP THE BALL SLIGHTLY BUT ON THE HEAD TO ABOUT NINETY DEGREES AND EXTEND UP
BALL COMES OFF THE RIBS ITS POSITION FIRST CONTACT FIRST TO MAKE SURE YOU FEEL THE OTHER GUY FIRST AND THEN YOU GO FOR THE BALL
SO YOU WANT TO ATTACK THE BALL WHICH IS WHAT YOU WOULD DO DURING THE PASSING PATTERN YOU WANT TO ATTACK THE BALL AND GET IT INTO YOUR POSITION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
NOW AS YOU GET A LITTLE BIT MORE SOPHISTICATED WITH IT YOU AGGRESSIVELY TO CATCH THE BALL OUT OF THE AIR
THROW THE BALL UP
NOW WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANYBODY AROUND INCREASES THE A OVER HERE I'M BRYAN IS JUST DOING IS WORKOUT WHAT BRYAN CAN DO AND I JUST CALLED THE LONELY BORE WORKOUT IS JUST THROW THE BALL UP TO YOURSELF AND WORK ON CATCHING JUST WORK ON YOUR CATCHING TECHNIQUE
AND THIS WILL BE THE TRUEST THING THAT HE CAN DO FROM SELF IS TO KEEP HIS ARMS PUMPING JUST LIKE YOU WOULD DURING RUNNING OR OUT AND GET THE BALL RIGHT INTO IS RIGHT INTO IS WINDOW
NOW THE BRIDE GETS MORE COMFORTABLE YOU CAN THROW THE BALL OF EMULATE OR RUNNING AND THEN BREAK DOWN AND CATCH THE BALL
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT WITHOUT GETTING THE BALL IN ALL PART
THAT WILL LET THE BALL RIGHT AND IT'S GOING TO COME ON JUST FINE
TAKE THE STRAP AROUND THE BALL THE FOOT AND LAY RIGHT DOWN
AND TO GET THAT BALL SOUND AGAIN YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR PLIE EGG TO DIG INTO THE GROUND
RIFFLE SHUFFLE SHUFFLE BALL
AND IT'S REALLY THE THE GOLDEN RULE IN PAINT BALL
THE NEXT THING IS CALLED A STUNT INTO A BALL IT'S SO JUST DONE
YOU CAN DO A MEDICINE BALL OR NO IT AT ALL
YOU CAN TO THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT OR THE INSIDE OF YOUR FOOT
THEN BEFORE THE BALL FURTHER BACK IN YOUR STANCE
SO THE PROBLEM WITH HITTING OFF OF THIS IS YOU CAN'T GET THE CLUB UNDERNEATH THE BALL THAT YOU CAN IN GRASS OR SAND OR EVEN LOOSE IMPEDIMENTS
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN LOSE A LOT OF STROKES IS WHEN YOU HIT A SKILL YOU IN YOUR SKULL BALL YOU CAN GO INTO WATER SAND TREES WHO KNOWS WHERE
SO YOU'RE GOING TO LINE UP LIKE YOU TO NORMAL SHOT BUT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT BEING SUPER RELAX BECAUSE YOU CAN IF YOU TRY TO MUSCLE THIS BALL BALL WHAT HAPPENS IS OFF HARD PAN THE CLUB HITS THE HARD PAN AND THEN SKIPS INTO THE BACK OF THE BALL PRODUCING A SKULL SHOT
OKAY NOW I'M READY TO TAKE THE CLUB BACK PROPERLY AND TO PUT A PROPER POWER FROM THE BODY INTO HITTING THE BALL
THEY'RE ALL CLEAR JUST LIKE THIS THE BALL
THE BALL IS THROWN WITHIN HIS OWN OF CATCHING ABILITY BUT IT'S SOMEHOW GOT PAST
NOW PASSED BALL IS VERY SIMILAR TO A WILD PITCH
THAT MEANS THAT THE CATCHER SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT THE BALL BUT DID
SO BASICALLY WHAT IT IS IS IT'S TWO PLAYERS TO TURN THEIR STICKS OF WITH THE BACKS TOWARDS EACH OTHER WITH THE BALL IN THE MIDDLE AND YOU HAVE BOTH HANDS ON THE STICK THEM TO DO WITHOUT THE BALL AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GET UP UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND FLING THE BALL ABOVE YOUR HEADS AND THEN ALL THE THAT TEAMMATES KIND OF MOVING TO TRY TO GET THE BALL AND GRAB POSSESSION
SO THE REFEREE WILL PLACE THE BALL I IT WITH IN THE BACK OF YOUR STICK AND YOU SET UP AND YOU'LL WAIT FOR THE WHISTLE BUT WE'RE JUST GOING TO COUNT OF THREE OKAY
AND SO TO WIN A DRY YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STURDY AND THAT YOUR LEGS ARE PLANETS FIRMLY AND IT YOU DON'T HAVE A GOOD GRIP ON YOUR STICK AND THE WAY YOU WHEN IT IS GET UNDERNEATH THE BALL REALLY QUICK AND AND HIT UP
AND I'LL SQUEEZE IT A LITTLE BIT SO THAT I CAN GET THIS BALL MOIST AND THEN I'LL TAKE MY RIGHT HAND AND PUSH TOWARDS MY LEFT HAND AND UP AND THEN DOWN USING THE HEEL OF MY LEFT HAND TO KEEP THAT CLAY FROM PUSHING OUT VERY FAR
FIRST YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR BALL OF CLAY AND YOU WANT IT TO BE AS ROUNDS POSSIBLE THAT MAKES CENTERING MUCH EASIER AND THROW IT DOWN PRETTY HARD RIGHT ON THE CENTER OF THE WHEEL
THE OVERHEAD PASS IS EFFECTIVE DURING THE GAME WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF SPACE BETWEEN YOU AND THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PASS IT TO AND YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO GET IN THERE WITH SOME ZIP SO THAT THE DEFENSE DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO GET IN BETWEEN AND TRY TO STEAL THE BALL
BUT IF THE BALL IS IN THE AIR AND YOU HIT IT THAT'S A VOLLEY
ALL OF OLLIE IS BECAUSE YOU'RE TAKING THE BALL BEFORE IT BOUNCES SO OBVIOUSLY THE BALL BOUNCES LIKE THIS THAT'S A GROUND STROKE
WHAT I BRING MY EYES BACK TO THE BALL I GO AHEAD AND HIT IT
I HAVE MY BALL JOINT PICKLE FORK
AND OF COURSE A BALL JOINT PRESS WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE TO CHANGE THIS GUY
AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A PARTICULAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LOWER BALL JOINT AND THE UPPER BALL JOINT CONTROL ARM ASSEMBLY
THE CONTROL ARM ASSEMBLY HAS THE BALL JOINT ALREADY PRESSED IN IT
WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR FEET TOGETHER YOU TRY TO DRAWING THE TOES TOGETHER THE BALL OFF WITH THE HEEL LOOK FOR
YOU DON'T NEED TO LEARN THE BALL AND YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE YOUR OWN SPIN ON EACH INDIVIDUAL TRICK
NOW CLUB JUGGLING TRICKS ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM BALL JUGGLING TRICKS
A WENDY'S CAT START TO DO SOME CLAWING BEHAVIOR ON AN APPROPRIATE OBJECTS IN THE HOUSE ONE THING IS YOU CAN DO IS YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME PLACE WHERE THEY CAN BALL
THE SET MY TOOL DOWN TO GRAB MY NEW BALL JOINT AND SHOW YOU THE TAPER ON IT
SO KEEP THAT IN MIND WHENEVER YOU'RE PLAYING BALL THE OVERHEAD PASS IS REALLY EFFECTIVE
THEY'RE NOT ASYMMETRICAL AS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT HERE NEXT TO THE BALL JOINT GREASE BOOT THERE IS AN L
IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CORRECT PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZE VEHICLE
SO THE BALL IS SNAPPED CITGO HE'S GOING TO USE A SWIM DO EVERYTHING THAT YOU NORMALLY DOES IT'S GOING TO LOOK JUST LIKE OR OUT
BECAUSE IF YOUR GROIN MUSCLES ARE USED TO IT JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T STRAIN THE BALL
TO GET OUT OF THIS BRING THE WEIGHTS DOWN DROP THE HIPS LIFT THE HEAD AND WALK YOURSELF BACK UP ON THE BALL
SO WE CAN SEE HERE THAT WE'VE GOT A POWER BALL DISPENSER ELEVATOR ADORE THAT'S WALKING A POWER BALL RECEPTACLE AND NOT ELEVATOR OVER HERE
I MIGHT WANT TO GIVE THAT A LITTLE BIT OF A BALL A LITTLE BIT THIS LITTLE BIT OF SHAPE SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND ROTATED BY USING THE TRANSFORM ROTATE TOOL AND PLACE IT A LITTLE BIT OFF CENTER MAYBE
SO IT'S A WAY OF PRACTICING ALL THE DIFFERENT LITTLE SHORT BALL GETTING TO EVERYTHING I'M WATCHING WITH YOUR OPPONENT IS
SO WHEN WE'RE DOING THIS MOTION OF EXPANDING OUTWARD WE HAVE TO ALSO BE THINKING WORK SPINNING DOWN OR EXPANDING BACK OR SPINNING UP IT'S LIKE A BALL OR I LIKE TO SEE IT IS A SUN EXPLODING OUTWARD
WHAT YOU WANT A LOB IT UP AND GIVE THE PLAYER ENOUGH TIME TO CATCH THE BALL AND DELIVER INTO THE BASKET WITH VERACITY
SO A DRAW OUT ONCE AGAIN IS TAKING THE BALL FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
IT'S A WAY OF AVOID A LOT OF TROUBLES IN YOUR WAY AND ALSO GETTING THE BALL IF THE GREEN IS HEAVILY BUNKER DEPENDS ON THE LEFT SIDE THIS IS A WAY OF TRACKING THE BALL TOWARD THE PIN
SO IT'S GOING TO GET EASIER AND EASIER TO HOOK THE BALL
SO YOU GET THE NORMAL UNDER SPIN OF STRIKING A BALL WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE THE FACE LIKE THIS TO CREATE SOME SIDES BECAUSE OF THE BALL WILL SPIN AND GO TO THE LEFT
SO WHAT YOU DO IS THIS IS HOW YOU LINE UP PRETTY NORMAL STRAIGHT BALL
SO AGAIN YOU'RE PLACING THE BALL IN FRONT OF YOU ARE PUSHING DOWN THROUGH THE HANDS EXTENDING OUT THROUGH THE HIPS AND THEN DRIVING THE ELBOWS IN TO THE SIDE
SO IF MY HANDS DON'T HIT THE BALL THE EXACT SAME TIME IT'S AN ILLEGAL HAT
SO A SETTING DRILLS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A TALL CIRCLE TOSS TO THE BALL AND YOU GET UNDER IT USE YOUR LEGS FACE YOUR TARGET AND YOU WANT TO PUSH THE BALL OUT WITH YOUR LIGHT NOT ONLY ARREST BUT YOUR LEGS ALSO AND FACE YOUR TARGET AND TRY TO GET IN THE TARGET
SO WHEN YOU'RE SETTING THE BALL YOU WANT TO TAKE THE BALL AND SHAPE YOUR HANDS IN THE SHAPE OF A BALL
OKAY IT'S YOUR HAND STAY FIRMLY ON THE MEDICINE BALL
YOU USE ENGLISH TO CONTROL THE ANGLES THAT A BALL COMES OFF OF A CUSHION NOT THE ANGLES THAT IT COMES OFF OF ANOTHER BALL
BUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR THIS TIME IS WHAT ANGLE DOES THE CUE BALL COME OFF OF THE CUSHION
OKAY IN THE LAST SEGMENT WE LEARNED IT USING ENGLISH DOES NOT HELP US CONTROL THE DIRECTION THAT THE CUE BALL COMES OFF OF AN OBJECT BALL AT AN ANGLE
SO I'M JUST GOING TO HIT THE BALL SOFTLY TO DINNER AND HE'S GOING TO HIT IT SOFTLY BACK TO ME
THIS WILL TEACH YOU HOW TO KEEP THE BALL IN PLAY AND TO HIT YOUR TARGETS
THIS IS TO GO UP A THAT NEEDS TO GO DOWN FOR YOU NOW HAVE A NICE BALL OF CLAY THAT SHOULD HAVE NO AIR BUBBLES THAT THIS IS HOW YOU CHECK IT OUT AND THEY GET BETTER WEDGING TOO
SO IF I'M THROWING A THREE BALL PATTERN IS THROWS A THREE OF COURSE THE AVERAGE IS THREE
NOW WHEN YOU JUGGLE THREE BALL PATTERN THAT'S JUST THREE THREE THREE CONTINUING
SO EACH THROW IS A THREE BALL HEIGHT AND THEY JUST CROSS LIKE THIS
ANY LITTLE BITS OF LIKE THIS LITTLE BALL JUST PULL THAT OFF BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT THAT GOING TO DO
I'M GOING TO COME INTO THE SOCCER BALL SOCCER BALL NEEDS TO BE SIXTY EIGHT TO SEVENTY CENTIMETERS AND DIAMETER AND NOW I HAVE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN TO FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY GRAMS OF WEIGHT IN THERE SO IT REALLY DOESN'T WAY TOO MUCH
AND THEN THE FINEST ONE BALL IS THE LITTLE TOOL IF YOU USE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY SIGN THE SCULPTURE
ALRIGHT SO GO AHEAD AND SQUEEZE THAT BALL OUT AND THIS WOULD BE NICE AND LOOSE AND THEN A LEAVE THAT ON THERE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO USE IT FOR OR A NEW PIPE
BUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS YOU HAVE TO GO GET THE BALL
IF THE BALL GOES OFF THE RIGHT SIDE YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACK THE RIGHT SIDE
THAT IS THE PROPER WAY TO SEE YOUR PICKLE FORK AND BREAK THE MECHANICAL WELD BETWEEN THE SPINDLE AND THE BALL JOINT
RIGHT THERE THE MECHANICAL WELD HAS BEEN BROKEN AS YOU CAN SEE OUR UPPER BALL JOINT IS NOW FREE AND WE'RE READY TO CONTINUE WITH THE REST OF THE DISASSEMBLY PROCEDURE
NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IS TURN IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT ON THE BALL TOO MUCH YOU SEE HOW THICK THIS IS BECOMING JUST LIKE THAT
WRIST UP BRING THE BALL UP AND I'VE OFF HERE I'LL LOSE THE BALL
RIGHT ABOUT WHEN YOU ABOUT THESE DISTANCE YOU REUSE THE BALL SO THE BALL GOES
YOU WANT TO START THE SURF WITH THE BALL ON TO THE NEXT JUST AS I HAVE IT
BECAUSE IT'S THE CLUB HEAD THAT HITS THE BALL IN THE BALL KNOWS ALL IN THE ONLY THING THE BALL KNOWS IS IMPACT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THERE BUT IF YOU COULD WATCH THE CLUB HEAD AT HOME IN PRACTICE SWINGS IN YOUR BACKYARD
THE REASON YOU WANT TO CLAP IS BECAUSE YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW HIGH TO TOSS THE BALL UP TO GIVE YOU ENOUGH TIME TO CATCH IT
THROW THROW THROW THROW AND THIS IS OUR THREE BALL CASCADE PATTERN
WE ADD THE THIRD BALL AND THE PATTERN HERE WILL JUST BE SOLID THROWS
SO THIS IS A TOUGH WIDE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GET YOU DO HAVE TO TRY TO GET UNDERNEATH THE BALL A LITTLE BIT TO GET IT UP
SO WHAT YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO DO HERE IS TO PICK THE BALL CLEANLY OFF THIS SURFACE BECAUSE IT IS ALMOST LIKE HITTING OFF OF CONCRETE
SO WHEN YOU GET A BETTER LIE AND FAIRWAY SAND JUST SAY OKAY JUST TAKE A GOOD APPROPRIATE CLUB AND JUST HITS THE BALL OUT OF THERE SO YOU WITH THE SWING ANOTHER DAY
OR IF YOU'RE TOO CLOSE TO THE SLIP IT TO BE VERY HARD FOR ME TO LONG IRON OUT OF HERE BECAUSE WHEN I HIT THE BALL IS GOING TO GO INTO THIS INTO THE LIP HERE
I'M SO OFTEN CASE A SIMPLE HEAT PICTURE JUST LIKE THIS A LAMP WITH A CERAMIC TOP ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A CERAMIC TOP AND A TWENTY FIVE OR FIFTY WATT BALL USUALLY SEVENTY FIVE TOPS WILL DO YOU AS FAR AS HEATING GOES
YOU'RE GOING TO GET A SCREW FOUR BALL OF ACRYLIC POWDER OUT AND APPLY TO THE NAIL
WITH THIS TECHNIQUE WORKS AN OPPONENT AS THEY PUNCH WITH THE LEFT YOU BLOCK TO THE LEFT HAND TO SHOOT THE RIGHT LEG AND KIND OF LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO KICK THE LOWER LEG SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO PASS BY BRING THE RIGHT LEG AROUND AND HIT WITH THE HEEL OF THE BALL THE FOOT
I NOW HAVE A SHOT ON THE EIGHT BALL
A DRAW SHOT AGAIN IS ONE WHERE I'M GOING TO POCKET THAT BALL AND I'M GOING TO MAKE THE CUE BALL COME BACK TOWARDS ME
YOU DON'T INEXPENSIVE PARRY FOODS YOU DON'T NEED A FANCY JERSEY JUST THE BALL AND THE ABILITY TO HAVE A GOOD TIME
YOU CAN GET THAT BY IT IN A BABY RATTLESNAKE OR ARE THE BALL IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT SIZE BITE
SO WORK ON THAT AND YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD FOUR BALL START
YOU CAN DO A STEADY ONE FINGER PRESSURE TO STAYING IN THAT PLACE OR YOU CAN DO CIRCULAR MOTION WITH YOUR THUMB OR WITH THE BALL OF YOUR FINGER
ON THE OUTSIDE OPPOSITE SIDE AS WELL THE WITH THE THAN THE ANY PART OF THE STICK RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE BALL IS GOING TO BE INSIDE AGAINST THE MILK CARTON SO YOU REALLY WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING THE STICK DIRTY WHILE YOU'RE PAINTING IT
THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOING TO BE SEEN ON THE OUTSIDE IS BASICALLY THE THE BALL ITSELF
ON THE TOP PART THERE'S GOING TO BE A BEAD PLACED ON IT SO THAT THE THE BALL WILL SO IT'S SECURELY WON'T FALL OFF THE STICK
SO IT'S ALSO EASY TO PAINT IT WHILE IT'S ON OF ON THE STICK BECAUSE A BALL IT'S HARD TO GRIP WHILE WHILE PAINTING IT SO THIS WAY GIVES THIS WAY TO HOLD ON TO THE BALL AND GET ALL SIDES UNDERNEATH AND ON TOP ALL AROUND THE BALL VERY EASILY WHILE IT'S ON THE STICK
NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PAINT THE STYROFOAM BALL BEING THAT THE STYROFOAM BALL IS GOING TO BE SITTING AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH IT'S GOING TO BE THE CENTER OF THE WINDOW WHERE ALL ALL THE ARMS ARE GOING TO BE HANGING
ONCE YOU HAVE A CONFIDENT FOUR BALL SHOWER PATTERN DOWN YOU CAN LEARN TRICKS WITHIN IT IN VARIOUS VARIATIONS
NOW THAT'S YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SHOOTING THE STORE FRESHER COURSE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO PUT THE BALL IN THE BASKET
WHAT YOU WANT I'M RIGHT HANDED SUMMER PLACE MY HAND BEHIND THE BALL SUCH INTO THE GROOVE
YOU GO TO THE SAME RESTAURANTS WE GO TO THE SAME MOVIES WE SEE THE SAME FRIENDS AND IT GETS TO BE BALL RAIN
SO IT'S JUST TOSS IT IS THE RACKET JUST PUSHES THE BALL RIGHT ABOVE THE TIN
I GREW UP IN TEXAS WATER SO I DON'T EVEN TASTE IT PUT THE BALL IS A LOT OF PEOPLE SO THEY CAN USE THE BLEACH IN THE BLEACH TABLETS ACTUALLY MAKES YOUR WATER TASTE LIKE SUPER SUPER CHLORINATED WHICH I CAN'T STAND BUT IF YOU CAN'T SAY EITHER THOSE HIS FOOT SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE DO IS THEY ACTUALLY JUST BRING GATOR A PACKETS AND THAT'LL ACTUALLY ALSO HELP YOU I KNOW REPLENISH THIS AND THE SALT STORES EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR THE DAY AND IT WILL LAST A NASTY TASTES OF THAT IDENTICALLY WHICH IS ALSO PUMPING THROUGH FILTERS BUT IT'S NOT AS THOROUGH AND YOU REALLY SHOULD USE THE IODINE TABLETS OR THE BLEACH ON TOP OF COMING IN THROUGH A FILTER
YOU CAN REMOVE THIS A GOOD NICE HANDY HANDLES THEIR OFF OF IT AND THIS IS WHERE THE HOLES ARE GOING TO AT ALL THIS ALL THE ACTION IS GOING TO SIT DOWN AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BALL THAT'S BASICALLY ANOTHER AND THIS IS IS A REALLY GREAT THANK YOU
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS REALLY BE CONSCIOUS OF KEEPING THE BALL LOW SO IN OTHER WORDS YOU DON'T WANT REAL HIGH THROW IS THERE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO CATCH
KEEP IT LOW IN REALLY BE CONSCIENCE CONSCIOUS OF THE BALL TRAVELING PAST THE EAR AND DROPPING RIGHT BEHIND YOUR SHOULDER AND IF YOU HAVE TO KICK YOUR SHOULDER OUT A LITTLE BIT FORWARD TO GET YOUR ARM BACK THERE THAT'S OKAY
SQUEEZE YOUR LEGS TOGETHER SQUEEZE YOUR KNEES TOGETHER AS A YOU'RE TRYING TO SQUEEZE THE TIGHT BALL SQUEEZE TIGHTEN FOR ABOUT FIVE SECONDS RELAX AND TRY TO BEND FURTHER
SO THAT'S HOW YOU PLAY ON THE LONGER IRON WHEN THE BALL IS ABOVE YOUR FEET
AFTER YOU ALSO WANT TO DO CIRCLES TO FLEX THE JOINTS ON YOUR ON YOUR ALL BALL IN SOCCER
OR IF YOU JUST ONLY STUDIED MUSICIANSHIP THAN YOU PLAY THE SONGS THEN YOUR TAP KNAP WON'T BALL SO AS LONG AS YOU ARE AWARE OF THE STORY FACETS OF A YOUR PROGRESS AND IF YOU'RE APPLYING THEN YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO INVOLVED IN YOUR CREATIVITY AND YOUR TECHNIQUE
AGAIN I MIGHT NEED TO FIND SOMETHING LIKE A BALL OR SOMETHING TO REALLY ENJOYS AND I WORK WITH TWO SO CHEESE WITH THIS TOY AND SHE'S HEAD IN A WAY FOR ME I'M GOING TO GO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WITH YET ANOTHER SQUEAKY TOY
I LOVE THE BALL YOU PROBABLY SEEN THESE IN THE GEMS ALL OVER THE PLACE
I'M GOING TO TAKE THE BALL AND I'M GOING TO PUT IT RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE
AND I LIKE TO START LOWER AND THEY WORK MY WAY UP BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE HEAVIER BALL IF YOU DROP IT YOU CAN GET HURT
SO NOW I HAVE A FOUR POUND BALL
IF YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT ELSE I'VE DONE WITH IT JUST FEEL FREE TO BROWSE AROUND AND FOR THE WOOD SHOP WITH OR SITTING ON THE BALL OR STANDING INHALE DIFFERENT OF THE DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF THE MOVES THAT YOU CAN GET IT ON THE BOARD LIKE THAT YOU NOW
WE WOULD TALK WITH THE MEDICINE BALL IS IS A VARIATION OF THE WOOD SHOP MOLD
SO INSTEAD OF HAVING THE BALL BACK HERE WITH ME SOMETIMES WHAT WE MIGHT DO AS A POOL READJUST THIS C AND PUT IT RIGHT BEHIND BREALAND AND INSTEAD OF FACING FORWARD PAUL WITH THEN BE FACING ME
IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT REMOVAL OF A COUPLE BREAK COMPONENTS IN ORDER TO PERFORM ARE BALL JOINT SERVICE
IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CORRECT PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZE VEHICLE
ACTUALLY YOU WANT TO START HERE AND GET THE BALL AND THAT'S HOW THE TOSS IS DONE
WE'RE GOING TO LAND IT INSTEAD OF THE BALL OF YOUR FEET YOUR HEELS
AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN DO ALL OF THE FUNDAMENTAL THINGS RIGHT YOU CAN COME UP THE SCREEN YOU CAN BE OPEN FOR A SECOND YOU CAN CATCH THE BALL YOU CAN GET READY TO SHOOTERS POCKET YOU CAN BE READY TO DELIVER THE SHOT BUT YOU HAVE A GOOD DEFENDER ON YOU THAT'S GOING TO COME OUT AND PLAY DEFENSE ON YOU AND THAT MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT TIME TO TAKE THE SHOT
SOMETIMES YOUR DEFENDER IS GO AHEAD AND CATCH THE BALL SOMETIMES YOUR DEFENDERS ARE GOING TO LAY BACK ON IT AND KEEP THEIR HANDS DOWN
SOMETIMES DEFENDERS ARE GOING TO CLOSE RIGHT OUT ON YOU AND ARE GOING TO HAVE A HANDLE THE BALL AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET A SHOT AWAY
IF YOUR PITCHER YOU WANT THE BALL TO SINK YOU WANT IT TO SELL YOU WANT TO START YOU WANT TO DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS MAKES THE TOP OR FOR THE BATTER TO HIT
HERE'S THE PROPER GRIP WHEN YOU THROW THE BALL FROM TUCKED UNDER THERE IS A BIG WHEN YOU THROW THE BALL AND IT COMES OUT OF YOUR FINGERS YOU HAVE FOUR SEAMS BREAKING THE AIR IT WILL TEND TO STAY STRAIGHT OR IF YOU THROUGH THE BALL THIS WAY WHERE THE SEAMS MAY MAKE IT SINK
NOW YOUR MOM ALWAYS TELLS YOU DON'T PLAY BALL IN THE HOUSE BUT HERE'S A DRILL YOU CAN DO AT HOME SITTING AT YOU
TAKE YOUR GLOVE JUST THROW THE BALL OF THE CHAIR PULL IT OUT GET THE PROPER GRIP
ON THE IODINE TABLETS COME AND A LITTLE BOTTLE WITH LIKE A LITTLE COTTON BALL ON TOP AND YOU JUST PUT ONE OF THE TABLETS IN THERE AND YOU WAIT FOR HALF AN HOUR OR WHATEVER IT SAYS ON THE BOTTLE AND THEN THE WATER IS BASICALLY TO DRINK IT TAKES CARE OF ALL THE STUFF THAT'S IN THE WATER
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF AN ODD BALL PLAY
WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE FIRST STRING ON WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE BALL AND THE STRING GOING TO PUT THAT RIGHT HERE AND THIS SLOT ON THE TAIL PIECE
ALRIGHT THIS THREE GUYS BRING THE BALL DOWN IS AS SOON AS I BRING THE BALL DOWN IS THE FIRST TWO GUYS OFF THE SIDELINE COME IN AND ESTABLISH THE DEFENSIVE POSITION
LINKS AND I'M GOING TO RETURN THESE PIECES TO THIS SAME BALL MOVEMENT AND THIS IS A PIRATES TYPE BOWL WITH THE GLASS COVER JUST FOR MARINATING BRIDGE
YOU HAVE THAT RIGHT SO KNOW WHAT YOU'LL BE PAYING AT THE TABLE YOU DON'T WANT ANY ANY MYSTERIES OR ANY AN ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO GET A BALL ARC THAT YOU CAN'T GIVE AN EXACT EXACT FIGURE MAKING SURE GIVE YOUR BALLPARK FIGURE ESTIMATED SELLERS PRO SEATS ARE IMPORTANT
STARTING WITH THE BALL DOWN A LITTLE BIT OFF
AND IF YOU BROKEN UP REALLY GOOD BUT YOU DIDN'T POCKET THE BALL AND YOU TURN CONTROL OF THE TABLE OVER TO YOUR OPPONENT ALL YOU'VE DONE IS JUST OPEN EVERYTHING UP SO THAT YOUR OPPONENT HAS AN EASY ROAD TO RUN OUT AND BE CHEW OFF OF YOUR OWN BREAK
HOWEVER IF YOU DON'T BREAK PROPERLY AND SAY YOU SCRATCH ON THE BRAKE OR YOU DON'T POCKET A BALL ALL YOU'RE DOING AT THAT POINT IS JUST TURNING CONTROL OVER THE TABLE TO YOUR OPPONENT
SO THE OBJECTIVE ON THE BRAKE IS TO OF COURSE POCKET AT LEAST ONE BALL WHICH IS THEN GOING TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY AT THE TABLE AND THEN TRY TO POCKET MORE BALLS
THEY CAN ALSO ADD SHADOWING TO THE BALL OF YARN
SO YOU NEVER LEAVE WITH YOUR HAND YOU WANT TO ALWAYS LEAVE WITH YOUR ELBOW IT'LL HELP YOU TO GET THE BALL STRAIGHT OVER THE NET TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE SERVE
IT'S THE SAME THING AND ALL YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE GOLF BALL AS YOU FALL THROUGH IT AND NOT LOOKING FOR YOUR SHOULDER SO IF YOU LOOK UP
WHEN YOU CONTACT THE BALL YOU WANT TO HIT IT ALMOST TO THE HEEL OF YOUR PALM AND IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR HAND
SO WHEN YOU TOSS THE BALL YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR ELBOW BACK AND WHEN YOU HIT YOU LEAD WITH YOUR ELBOW
WHEN YOU KEEP YOUR HAND UP AND YOU HAVE MORE SURFACE AREA ON THE BALL WHICH CAN HELP YOU TO GUIDE THE BALL TO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE COURT
SO WHEN YOU'RE STARTING THE BALL YOU WANT YOUR HAND OUT IN FRONT OF YOU YOU WANT TO TOSS THE BALL UP IN FRONT OF YOU SO YOU HAVE TO STEP AND HIT IT WITH YOUR HAND
AND THIS IS A TYPE OF BALL IS A BALL IN FRONT OF YOU YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO STEP INTO IT AND KIND OF THE TAP THE PLAYER
A BALL THAT WILL DO IS STRETCH YOUR BICEPS A LITTLE BIT
SO AFTER A LITTLE BIT OF THIS ALL SWITCH OFF AND I'LL GO TO A FULL CIRCLE WITH MY BOWLING BALL
YOUR CUE BALL STARTS IN THE SAME PLACE
YOUR OBJECT BALL STARTS RIGHT IN THE CENTER THE TABLE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO KICK THE BALL IN EITHER ONE OF THESE TWO POCKETS FROM THAT SET UP
AND THIS ONE HAS BEEN WORKING FOR A WHILE BUT THIS THIS BALL WINE STILL HAS BUBBLES THAT THERE ARE BUBBLING UP CONSTANTLY
THAT REALLY GIVE YOU A LOT MORE OPPORTUNITY TO WHERE THE KIND OF BALL GAMAGE TOO FAR
THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO PRACTICE THESE SHOTS BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO KNOW HOW MUCH A BALL HOOKS WHEN YOU SWING ON THE PRACTICE RANGE BEFORE YOU HAVE TO DO IT ON THE GOLF COURSE
SO NOW THIS BALL IS GOING TO HOOK MORE THAN MY SAND WEDGE OR PITCHING WEDGE WILL
I'VE I HIT IT MIGHT TEE SHOT BUT I'M ON AN UPHILL LIE OR A BALL THE BALL IS ABOVE MY FEET
TO BEGIN WITH THE STABILITY ON THE BOSU WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN AND YOU'RE GOING TO BRING THE BLACK SIDE TO THE TOP AND THE BALL PART IS GOING TO BE ON THE BOTTOM AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO PUT MY FEET ON HERE TAKES A LITTLE BIT OKAY YOU'RE GOING TO MIGHT BE A LITTLE NERVOUS BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO BRING BOTH YOUR FEET ON TOP OF THE BALL LOOKS JUST LIKE THAT
NOW SOMETIMES IT CAN HELP IF YOU DEFLATE THE BALL A LITTLE BIT TO GET STARTED BUT THIS ONE'S PRETTY BLOWN UP WHAT WE WANT TO DO WE WANT TO BRING OURSELVES UP ON TOP OF THAT BALL WORK ON GETTING OUR BALANCE BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING ELSE
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THE BALL COMES OUT COMES OUT OF YOUR HAND IN SPIRALS TO GIVE IT THE WHOLE TONE TRAJECTORY TO TARGET AND IT IS
HI MY NAME'S JOE I'M AT BREAK TIME BILLIARDS IN WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO FIGURE HOW FAR AWAY FROM THE BALL TO STAY IN AND ALSO HOW TO MAKE A STANCE
BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THIS GUY IS GOING TO CATCH THE BALL AND HE'S GOING TO DRIVE PAST HIS MAN
THIS GUY RIGHT NOW HAS THE BALL SO HE HAS TO COMMIT TO HIM IS TO GUARD HIM FULLY BUT AS QUICKLY AS THE BALL MOVES FROM THERE GO AHEAD AND MOVE IT TO THE TOP OF THE KEY
LIKE UNDER ONE BALL DOES LOCKS OFF AND BALL JUST TOOL TO DEFEND TYPE OF SHAPES BEACH COPS AN EYE YOU REALIZE THIS ONE SHAPE IS THEY WANT THEY THOUGHT DESIGN
MAYBE A PAIR OF I SHIFT TO THE BALL AND THE OFF OF WATER THE BLOCK YOU PERFORM FIVE DIFFERENT ABOUT IN THIS IN THIS CDS
REASON BEING IS SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT HAVE THE BALL AND THE TEAM MIGHT FALL YOUR BUT YOU MIGHT STILL MAINTAIN POSSESSION OF THE BALL OR TEAMMATE MIGHT CAUSE THAT'S THE BALL AND GIVE YOURSELF A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SCORE A GOAL
NOW SAY THAT THE CLAY IS GOING OUT AND THERE'S A FOUL AND YOU TOUCH THE BALL BUT DO NOT GET GOOD POSSESSION THAN THE OTHER TEAM GETS IT INITIALLY THE OFFICIAL MIGHT NOT A MIGHT NOT THAT STOP IS THE THINGS YOU HAVE ADVANCE
ONCE YOU CAN DO THAT START THE VAMP THE BALL IS ONE OF THE TIME BACK TO THE HAND THEY WERE THROWN FROM
THE MAIN FEET IS GIVEN THAT IS IN THE EVENING TAG LIKE A BALL PHOTO CLOCK AND ALL THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE AND SLIP IT BETWEEN YOUR SPINDLE AND YOUR BALL JOINT AND HAMMERED INTO POSITION
THE WAY THIS IS DESIGNED AND I'LL SHOW YOU ON MY NEW BALL JOINT HERE TO SECOND IS IT IS A CONCAVE HERE ON THIS SIDE AND A CONVEX ON THIS SIDE
IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE PROPER METHOD FOR BREAKING THE MECHANICAL WELD BETWEEN YOUR BALL JOINT AND YOUR SPINDLE
IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CORRECT PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZE VEHICLE
IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE TOOLS REQUIRED AND THE PARTS NECESSARY TO REPLACE YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZE VEHICLE
IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CORRECT PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZE VEHICLE
BUT BECAUSE THIS BOWL I TURNED AWAY THE FOOT AND WE HAVE A COMPLETELY ROUNDED BOTTOM I HAVE NO WAY TO HOLD THE BALL SO WE'RE GOING TO DO IT THIS WAY
IN THE FOLLOWING CLIPS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CORRECT PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING YOUR UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS ON A TWO WHEEL DRIVE FULL SIZE VEHICLE
IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE LAST STEP INVOLVED IN OUR BALL JOINT SERVICE
DURING A BALL JOINT SERVICE WE HAD TO REMOVE OUR VEHICLES BREAKING CALIPER
IF YOU'RE NOT REACHING THE FLOOR THAT MEANS THE BALL IS TOO BIG FOR YOU ALSO ADJUST THE SIZE ACCORDINGLY OR YOU CAN DO IT RIGHT HERE
BUT ANYWAY THROW THE BALL TO THE GLOVE POINT OF THE PROPER GRIP
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE MEDICINE BALL BASICALLY WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO CHEST PASS IS BACK AND FORTH
THAT BALL CHEST PASS
GUYS ON START WITH THE BALL HERE I'M GOING TO PUSH STRAIGHT OUT
I THINK IT WAS A BACK THE SMIDDY'S KIDS DECIDE TO START THROWING A BALL INTO A CUP
THEN ONCE YOU'VE GOT THAT YOU CAN ADD ONE MORE THROW AND SO ON AND TELL YOU CAN KEEP IT GOING JUST LIKE YOUR THREE BALL PATTERN
SO JUST LIFTING THE BALL UP IN THE AIR POPPING IT UP AND IT PRETTY MUCH ALLOWS US TO BE BOUNCING AFTER THAT
SO PUT THE BALL ON THE GROUND ROLL IT UP TO THE CLUB PUSH ONTO THE CLUB AND IN ONE SWIFT MOTION WE'RE GOING TO LIFT AND LOWER THE CLUB
TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO BOUNCE A GOLF BALL ON THE FLAT SURFACE OF A GOLF CLUB
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE I'M GOING TO SWITCH TOOLS NOW THAT ON THE BALL
SEE IF YOU'LL GO OUT THERE TO GET IT WHEN HE GOES OUT PRAISE HIM HEAVILY ALLOW HIM TO GET THAT BALL
SO MAYBE IF THE DOG LOVES A BALL THROW A BALL UP INTO THE WATER
NOW TO GET YOUR TIMING TO REALLY NAIL THAT TIMING DONE WE'RE GOING TO TOSS THAT BALL UP AND CLAP IN BETWEEN
SO YOU GOT YOUR FAVORITE BALL
WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT THAT IS IS THAT IT'S A FAKE JUST A FAKE TO ONE SIDE SO THEY THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GO THAT WAY BUT THE BALL IS GOING TO KEEP DRAWING THE SAME WAY AND YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT
ONCE YOU GET A BOX OUT THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GO IN YOU'RE GOING TO EXPLODE UP YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THE BALL YOU'RE GOING TO RIP IT OFF THE BACKBOARD
THE OBJECT IS SOCCER IS TO POSSESS THE BALL AND WORK IT DOWN THE FIELD IN ORDER TO SCORE A GOAL
ALL YOU REALLY NEED IS A BALL AND A FIELD THE PLANE
YOU CAN NOT BOX OUT AND ALLOW THE BALL TO COME TO YOU
BREATHE NICE AND EASY AND TAKE A NICE EASY SWING AND REMEMBER YOU JUST WANT TO PICK THE BALL CLEANLY OFF OF THIS WITH A MINIMAL DIVOT
SO YOUR OPPONENT HITS A PRETTY GOOD SHOT PIECES SEE I JUST GET THE RACKET THERE I'M NOT DOING LIKE A DROP SHOT A MORE TRADITIONAL ONE I'VE GOT A WRAP IT UP AND I'M JUST USING THE STRENGTH IN HIS BLOCKING THE BALL SO JUST GOES RIGHT ABOVE THE TIN
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR CHRISTMAS INTERFERING WITH THE BOWLING BALL KIND OF A RUIN YOUR GAVE IT CAN BE A LITTLE DISTRACTION
EXCELLENT HE'S FOUND IS BALL YOU NOW CAN GO AHEAD AND PLAY A SECOND SHOT AND LEAVE A HELP SPEED UP THE PACE APPLY
SO I ACTUALLY ONE EVEN LOOK AT MY BOWLING BALL UNTIL AFTER I USE MY MARK
IT COMES OUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHERE YOU'RE LOOKING AFTER YOU THROW THE BALL
I WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE BALL IN THE CORNER POCKET WHICH I WOULD MAKE A AND THEN I WOULD HAVE MYSELF IN A POSITION YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TRY TO PLAY POSITION IT'S ANOTHER VIDEO TAPE FOLKS GOOD I PUT MYSELF IN SUCH A POSITION THAT I COULD PLAY THE OF THE TIME BALL IN THIS CORNER AND MAKE MY CUE BALL COME OUT FOR A GOOD POSITIONING SHOT FOR THE EIGHT BALL AND WINNING THE GAME
LET ME JUST SHOW YOU THE TWO LEGAL SHOTS THAT WOULD MAKE HERE ON THE TWELVE AND ON THE TEN BALL OF THE STRIPES
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO ONE POCKETING YOUR BALLS LEGALLY AND SCORING ALL OF YOUR BALLS FIRST BEFORE YOUR OPPONENT DOES AND GIVING YOU A GOOD EXECUTION SHOT FOR WINNING THE GAME AND SHOOTING THE EIGHT BALL AND CLEAN
SO I WOULD SAY TEN BALL IN THE CORNER AND YOU SEE THE CUE BALL COMES OUT TO A POSITION ON THE TABLE WHERE I HAVE A NICE SHOT ANGLE SHOT FOR THE EIGHT BALL ON THE CORNER
THEN WE ADD THE SECOND BALL AND TRY THE SAME THING
WE STARTED WITH JUST A SINGLE BALL
TO THROW A THREE BALL PATTERN
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE BALL GO IN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
YOU KEEP HIS HEAD BACK WHEN I'M AN EASY IS THE KIND OF MY BODY TO HELP PULL HIM ACROSS THE BALL OF THE CLOTHING BY ITSELF SO I
BALL IS THAT YOU CAN GET THE OBJECT
NOW I'VE DONE US SOME OTHER ONES WHERE YOU CAN SPIN AROUND AND CATCH THE BALL AND THESE ARE FOR DOWN DEEP PATTERNS WHERE YOU ACTUALLY LOOKING BACK OVER YOUR SHOULDER AND IT'S THE TRUE IS WAY TOO DISORIENT YOURSELF AND LOCATE THE BALL AT THE SAME TIME
AND DRYING CAN DO THIS HUNDRED TIMES A DAY AND HIS HANDS WILL IMPROVE HIS VISION FOR THE BALL AND HIS ABILITY TO LOCATE
THE SAME CAN BE APPLIED TO BALL FIGURE STUDIES HUMANS IF YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A CONVENIENT MODEL LIKE YOUR MOM AROUND OR ARE SIMPLY OR AUTOMOBILES SOMETHING I'VE ALSO DRAWN SINCE I WAS LITTLE
WHEN WE OPEN UP OUR HAND FOR A SIX NINE BALL BEING TWENTY ONE
LOOKS IS THAT MY PARTNER IS HIT THE BALL INTO THE WOODS
I'M GOING TO TALK TODAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT TO DO IF YOUR PARTNER LOSES HIS GOLF BALL OR HOW TO HELP THEM FIND IT
AS YOU CAN SEE IN MY PLAYING PARTNER HAS LAST IS BALL ON THIS HOLE AND IN THE GAME OF GOLF IS GOOD ETIQUETTE OR CUSTOMARY TO HELP THEM FIND IS BALL
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF ETIQUETTE NOT ONLY WILL YOU HELP SPEED UP PLAY BUT YOU ALSO BE DOING YOUR PARTNER FAVOR BY HELPING AND TRY TO LOCATE IS BALL
HE'S GOING TO READ TEA THE BALL HIT A PROVISIONAL JUST IN CASE WE CAN'T FIND OF THE FIRST ONE THAT HE HIT INTO THE WOODS
SO WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AROUND HERE AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND HIS BALL
UP IN FRONT OF THE SMALL TACTIC IS WE HAVE OUR LOWER BALL JOINTS WITH THE RETAINING NUT AND HARDWARE INSIDE
WE HAVE THE UPPER CONTROL ARM BALL JOINT ASSEMBLY
LIKE I SAID IT IS AN UPPER CONTROL ARM BALL JOINT ASSEMBLY
YOU SEE HOW THE BODY TURNS JUST TO THROW A BALL
THAT'S CALLED A BODY TURN SO NOW I'VE GOT MY BODY COILED AND WHEN I UNCOIL GENERATE A LOT OF POWER TO HIT THE GOLF BALL
BECAUSE WHEN THE BALL COMES OFF A LOB SO BE VERY STEEP SO HE'S NOT ABLE TO HIT IT AS POWERFUL YOURS ACCURATELY IF I EXECUTE MY LOB SERVE WELL
AS SOON AS THESE GUYS GO OUT THIS GUY JOINS THEM SO THAT IT'S THREE ONTO THESE GUYS GET THE BALL THEY BRING IT DOWN AND THAT IT'S THREE ONTO IT GOES BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH
THE WOODS BALL TO AT YOUR LOCAL HOSPITAL FALL INTO AT THE FOOD BANK VOLUNTEER PURSUE KITCHEN
WIDE BASE ARMS OUT TO ESTABLISH CONTACT LOW CENTER GRAVITY BALL COMES OFF AT LEAST TWO FEET AWAY FROM THE RIB ESTABLISHED CONTACT FIRST GET AGGRESSIVELY GET THE BASKETBALL
IF WE TAKE THIS POT CRACKED BUT WHAT I REALLY LIKE IS THE MAIN STEEL BALL CRACK
I AM IN THIS WHAT IS IN A BALL THAT TRADITIONALLY THIS TYPE OF APPARATUS WAS IN A ROUND SHAPE
OKAY NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO STEEP TEA USING AND DIFFUSING BALL
WORK THE DROP SHOT ANY COUNTER DROPS MADE AND I HAD THE ANGLE SHOT A BALL THAT'S A PRETTY TOUGH SHOT
SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS WHEN YOU'RE HAVING A BALL OF YOUR SIZE MAKING SURE THAT THE THIGHS ARE PARALLEL TO THE FLOOR YOU'RE GOING TO ROLL INTO IT UNTIL THE HEAD IS PARALLEL TO THE FLOOR SO YOU HAVE THAT SUPPORT IT'S LIKE A PILLOW UNDER YOU
ABDOMINAL CRUNCH ON THE BALL
THE OTHER THING YOU CAN DO IS YOU CAN GET A BALL ANY TYPE OF LITTLE LIKE RUBBER PALM AND JUST KIND OF HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND AND I'M JUST KIND OF PRACTICE CURLY EXERCISES
ONCE HE TAKES A SNAP FIRST OF ALL HE'S GOING TO TURN AND HE'S GOING TO DO WHAT WE CALL SEATING THE BALL
HE'S JUST GOING TO SEE THE BALL RIGHT HERE IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE A FAKE TO THE FULLBACK
OUR QUARTERBACK PRETTY MUCH RUNS JUST LIKE YOU WOULD A NORMAL HAND OFF PLAY EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT ONCE THE HANDS THE BALL OFF OUR QUARTERBACK THEN ALSO HAS TO TURN AND RUN TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FIELD SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN GO DOWN FIELD AND BECOME A BLOCKER AS WELL
SO WITH THIS WAY UP DOWN BALL AND GET THE BALL
SO YOU'VE TOSSING THE BALL JUST AS YOU'RE TAKING YOUR RACKET BACK BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO COME TO THE BACK STRETCH
BUT I LIKE TO SEE THE STUDENTS TO MAKE THE BASE OF THE BASE OF A TRIANGLE AND YOU WANT TO GET THE BALL RIGHT OVER YOUR HEAD THE APEX
WE THEN WANT TO TRY TO PUT THE WHOLE TOSS THE BALL IS TO TAKE IT BACK
TAKE A KNEELING POSITION AND AGAIN PULL THE BALL INTO MY HIP AND PLACE THE HIP ON TOP OF THE BALL TO LEAN OVER AND I'VE JUST PLACE MY HAND AT THE SIDE AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS REDUCE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN MY RIB CAGE AND MY HIP
AND IF I CAN DROP OVER THE BALL EVEN MORE THAN I'M GETTING MORE RANGE OF MOTION AND MORE INTENSITY ON THAT MUSCLE GROUP
FORM IS REALLY IMPORTANT ON THIS ONE SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR HEAD AND YOUR SHOULDERS ARE ON THE BALL
THAT IS MAKE SURE I GET THE BALL CLEANLY
SO GETTING MY SETUP THIS PARAMOUNT AND THE TENDENCY IS TO SLICE OR FADE THE BALL ARE THE SAND
OR I DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION I NEED TO PUT THE BALL SEVENTY FIVE YARDS
SO I'M GOING TO TRY MY SAND WEDGE SO HERE I'M NOT TRYING TO SPIN IT OR PUT IT ON THE GREEN I'M JUST TRYING TO ADVANCE THE BALL TOWARD THE GREEN OR TO GET IT TO THE GREEN WITH A FULL CLUB
COME UP YOU WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THOUGH THAT THE NEXT REALLY DO HAVE A PURPOSE SO IF YOU'RE SETTING UP YOUR OWN BASKETBALL HOOP AT HOME YOU WANT TO DEFINITELY PUT AN IT UP THAT PREVENTS THE BALL FROM GOING OUT OF BOUNDS AND YOU HAVE ANY CHASING DOWN ALL OVER THE PLACE
NOW ALSO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PLAYING BALL THE BRACE LOTS OF TIMES YOU'LL SEE A PULL LIKE THIS WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING OUTDOORS OR YOU'LL SEE AN ACTUAL CALM COMBINATION OF THINGS BRACING THE BACK BOARD UP IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT INDOORS
IT DEPENDS ON HOW BIG THE BALL IS GOING TO BE THAT WE'RE USING FOR HIS THIGH
IT EARLIER WAS PLAYED WITH THE PING PONG PADDLES LIKE A TABLE TENNIS GAME IN THAT BE TURNED INTO WHERE YOU JUST THROW THE BALL INTO THE CUP WHICH MADE IT A LOT EASIER AND THE IT DRUNK A LOT QUICKER HONESTLY
ONCE YOU'RE DONE WITH THE AFTERSHAVE A BALL APPLICATION IF YOU FEEL YOUR SKIN TO LOSE THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT DRY YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND USE MOISTURIZER AND APPLY JUST LIKE YOU DID THE AFTERSHAVE GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR GROWTH OF THE OF THE HAIR TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR SKIN IS AND DRY OR IF YOU TAKE
SO ALL YOU'RE GOING TO CONTOUR YOURSELF IN A BALL
BUT I WOULD USE ABOUT I WOULD SAY SIDEWALKS CEMENT WITHOUT ANY BIG YOU KNOW ABOUT DIVOTS TAKEN OUT OF IT OR ANYTHING IS A GOOD PLACE BECAUSE YOU NEED A GOOD YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT WHICH WAY THE BALL IS GOING TO BOUNCE BACK UP
OKAY AND YOU FEEL THE PRESSURE ON THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE SIX BALL IN THE SIDE POCKET
SO WHAT I DO IS I A MY STICK BEHIND THE CUE BALL AT WHERE I WANT TO HIT ON THE SIX BALL
I ACTUALLY DOES STARING AT YOUR MARK THE WHOLE ENTIRE TIME INTO THE BOWLING BALL HAS TO COME UP
IF I'M COMING UP HERE WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE BALL OUTSIDE THE CORD ON THE SIDE TO GO
SO JUST MAKE SURE YOU KEEP YOUR ELBOWS CLOSE TO YOUR BODY UP ON YOUR CONTACT THE BALL AT THIS POINT IN FRONT OF YOU
AGAIN NORMALLY HAPPENS ON THE BACKHAND SIDE BECAUSE WE ARE MOVING ABOVE THIS ALL OUT WHEN WE'RE AIMING THE BALL AS YOU CAN SEE MY FACE OF THE RACKET IS LOOKING OVER THEIR INSTEAD OF LOOKING IN FRONT OF ME AND IS HAPPENING BECAUSE MY WRIST IS GIVING NAP MY LEFT RISK OF THE NAPE OF MY BODY IS GOING FORWARD
OKAY WE'RE GOING TO DO THE BACKHAND VOLLEY GEARS TO HIT A BACKHAND DRIVE TO ME SO THIS IS A GOOD ANGLE TO SEE HOW GARY PREPARES A RECORD TURNS THE SHOULDERS AND STEPS INTO THE BALL IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE GOOD TO WATCH SO I KEEP MY RACKET UP AND I VOLLEY THE BALL GENTLY JUST OPEN THE FACE AND PUTTING THE BACK OF THE WALL
I'VE CHOSEN AUGER JUST TURNS TO THE BALL PRETTY EFFORTLESSLY STRAIGHT AND I JUST KEEP THE RACKET OPEN IT REALLY DOESN'T TAKE MUCH WORK TO GET THE BALL BACK SO I DEVELOPED I DROP VOLLEY GARY DEVELOPS IS DRIVE A IT'S QUITE A WORKOUT TOO
WATCH HOW GARY STEPS TO THE BALL
IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW LOOKS FROM THE OTHER ANGLE SO I WANT TO TAKE NOTE OF HOW GARY TURNS IT GETS THE RACQUET READY STEPS IN THE BALL HITS IT BACK TO MAY NOTICE HOW I OPEN THE FACE THE RACKET EGG AND THAT LOFTED BACK SO YOU CAN HIT IT AGAIN
ANOTHER WORD THAT'S THE ACTION THAT WE REALLY WANT ON THE CUE BALL IS NO ACTION AT ALL
WHAT WE WANT IT TO DO IS SLIDE INTO THAT BALL
BECAUSE IF IT SLIDES STRAIGHT INTO THE OBJECT BALL WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THE CUE BALL IS GOING TO IMPART ALL OF ITS ENERGY TO THE OBJECT BALL SENDING THE OBJECT BALL ON ITS WAY IN THE CUE BALL IS GOING TO LOSE EVERYTHING IT'S GOT GOING FOR AND IT'S GOING TO STOP DID STILL
OKAY OUR NEXT SHOT ARE ON OUR THREE MOST BASIC CUE BALL POSITION SHOTS IS THE STOP SHOT
AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF ACTION DO WE NEED TO HAVE ON THE CUE BALL ON CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT BALL IN ORDER TO GET IT TO STOP
AND I'M JUST GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO BE LOOKING FOR ON EVERY STOP SHOT REGARDLESS OF DISTANCE IS YOU WANT TO BE TRYING TO CATCH THE CUE BALL IN ITS SLIDE
SO FROM THIS POSITION RIGHT HERE IN ORDER TO SLIDE THIS BALL FROM THERE TO THEIR IT SHOULD BE A SIMPLE MATTER OF HITTING IT RIGHT AT THE CENTER
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO UNDERSTAND AND THAT YOU JUST HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE BALL WHEN YOU'RE IN A CERTAIN POSITION AND YOU PUT THE BALL UP THEIR OFF OF THE GLASS IT'S GOING OFF A COME IN AND BOUNCE INTO THE TO THE RIM NOW TURN THERE'S MANY
YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR HANDS TOUCH THE BALL OF THE EXACT SAME TIME
SO WHEN YOU'RE SETTING THE BALL TAKE THE BALL ABOVE YOUR HEAD WHERE AS IF YOU MISS THE BALL I WOULD HIT YOU IN YOUR FOREHEAD
SO THE SET IS GOING TO SET YOU THE BALL YOU TAKE YOUR APPROACH JUMP UP AND HIT IT OVER THE NET
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO TAKE A BONE AWAY FROM A PICK BALL BECAUSE IF YOU DO THAT CHANCES ARE YOU GOING TO GET BIT
WELL THE MAIN POINTS OF ALL YOUR MOVEMENT IN SQUASH IS TO GET BACK TO THE TEE AREA RIGHT HERE SO WHEN I SERVICE I SERVING OVERHEAD SERVE I WANT TO WATCH THE BALL I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE TEE
WHETHER I SERVE BACKHANDED IF I SERVER NICE FULL BALL I CAN ALMOST WALK TO THE TEE IF I HIT IT A LITTLE HARDER I'VE GOT TO GET READY BECAUSE OF THE GETTING TO THE TEE AFTER YOU HIT YOUR SERVE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU CAN DO
OKAY IF I'M HERE IN A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER AND I PUSH MORE WITH THE BALL OF MY FOOT I'M GOING TO WORK IS TO YOUR DROP MUSCLE MORE RIGHT IN HERE RIGHT IN HERE WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT AREA TO WORK IT PROTECTS YOUR KNEE
IT WOULD DO IS PLACE THE CELLS IN HARNESS BUCK OR SEAT BELTS CAUSE THAT'S THE BALL AND NOW WE'LL GO FOR RIDE
WE'LL JUST BE ABLE TO SHUT OFF THAT BALL VALVE
THIS IS GOING TO SHUT OFF THE WATER TO THE ENTIRE HOUSE AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL HAVE TO BE DOING THIS ONCE WE INSTALL OUR BALL VALVE
IN THIS VIDEO CLIP I WILL SHOW YOU STEP TO ENTER PROCESS OF INSTALLING A BALL VALVE
IT'S GOT THE SIZE OF A OF A WEIGHTED BALL
I'M A CHORD MINIMUM IS GOING TO BE FIFTY FEET TO ONE HUNDRED FEET ON THE HOOK UP TO A GFI NOW A TRIP IF THIS WERE TO LEAK OR THE CHORD WOULD WITH BREAK OR THE WATER GOT IN THE BALL ANYTHING LIKE THAT TO SAVE YOURSELF ELECTROCUTE
SO ONCE YOU DO IS PUT THE BALL ON THE TOP OF THE CLUB LOOK AT THAT BALL
WHEN A SLIGHT BEND IN THE KNEES FEET HIP WIDTH APART AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP TO THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT WITHOUT LETTING GRAVITY PULL YOU FORWARD
WE HAVE ONE BALL TO ONE UP TO UP
THIS IS OUR NORMAL THREE BALL PATTERN AND WE THROW ONE STRAIGHT UP AND WE THROW THE OTHER TWO STRIPS
LIKE THIS WHERE ONE BALL IS CONTINUOUSLY CROSSING OVER THE TOP OF THE OTHERS
FOR EVERY BALL IS CROSSING OVER THE BALL IN FRONT OF IT
NEXT WE'LL BE MOVING ON TO SOME MORE ADVANCED BALL TRICKS
AS FAR AS FLIGHT PADS EVERYTHING IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL THE THREE BALL JUGGLING EXCEPT YOU HAVE THE ADDED COMPLEXITY OF THE CLUBS SPINNING AND YOU HAVE TO BE PAY ATTENTION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH THE RIGHT HAND
IN THIS SECTION WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT A SONG CALLED BALL NOT RAG AND WE'RE GOING ON AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ELEMENTS OF RAGTIME MUSIC
I'M GOING TO DO IS TAKE AND SLIP RIGHT BACK IN HERE AND INSTALL OUR CAMBER BALL
OTHERWISE USE IT MIGHT AS WELL USE A TENNIS BALL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
OBVIOUSLY THIS POINT THE BALL IS JUST THE BRAKES SO ALL YOU DON'T NECESSARILY INCREASE THE WEIGHT OF THE BALL BUT INCREASING WHICH ALL RIGHT THE POLICE
YOU'RE GOING TO TWIST YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER AND YOU'RE GOING TO TURN YOUR RIGHT FOOT OUT ON THE HEEL AND YOU'RE GOING TO ALLOW THE LEFT TOE TO TURN ON THE BALL THE FOOT
AND THIS IS FOR A BALL THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DEEPER THAT IS WHY YOU NOTICE THE STATE OR YOUR STEPS AND NOT HAVE TOO MANY
THE INSIDE CRUNCH WITH ALL THE FITNESS BALL SUPPORT
ANYWAY IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE POSITIONING OF THE BALL YOU ICE RECOMMEND THAT YOU WATCH THE CLIP WITH THE POSITIONING SO YOU LEARN HOW TO GET THE BALL CORRECTLY
IT GOES ON FOR HOURS IT'S A GREAT DRILL DEVELOP A LOT OF BALL HANDLING SKILLS
EACH BALL IS OUT LATER
HI I'M BOBBY LAREW AND WE'RE HERE PULL SIDE I'M GETTING READY TO DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU ANY REVERSE ONE HALF SUMMER SOFTEN THE TUCK POSITION OR GAINER ONE IN HALF MOON DIRECTLY TO THE BALL THE SAME THING
THE LAST IN OUR IT THREE BASIC CUE BALL POSITION SHOTS IS THE DROP SHOT
WHERE WHAT WE ARE WANTING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO PULL THE CUE BALL BACK TOWARDS IS
IN OTHER WORDS IF WE HAVE THIS SET UP RIGHT HERE IN OUR GAME OF EIGHT BALL ONCE AGAIN
THIS IS MY LAST OBJECT BALL ON THE TABLE
BUT AGAIN IF I'M GOING TO STOP MY CUE BALL RIGHT THERE THAT'S NOT GOING TO GIVE ME A GOOD SHOT
IF I FOLLOW ALONG BEHIND IT THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING FOR ME MY EIGHT BALL IS WAY OVER HERE
SO I NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE CUE BALL TO BRING IT BACK TO GIVE ME AN EASY SHOT ON THE EIGHT BALL
WELL THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO TAKE THE BOWL OFF THE CUISINARTS AND BRING IT OVER TO THE BALL THAT YOU HAVE A MAZZARELLA HIM AND REMOVE ALL OF THE CHEESE WHICH IS NOW SLIGHTLY TINTED GREEN FROM THAT FRESH BASIL WHICH IS REALLY GREAT IT AND THEN ON OUR NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO PUT IT ON OUR BAGUETTE SLICES WHICH ARE PURPOSE TEENY I PUT IT ON FAIRLY THICK LIKE THIS MOUNTING IT AND GETTING IT ABSOLUTELY TO EVERY EDGE OF THE BAG OUT
I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE SOME CRUNCHES WITH THE MEDICINE BALL
WITH THAT IN MIND I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE SOME MEDICINE BALL EXERCISES THAT OF COURSE OUT AS YOU GET STRONGER YOU INCREASE RESISTANCE LIKE IN A BIG OR SMALL
WHEN THE BALL RIGHT LIKE CHEST I TAKE A DEEP BREATH
INSTEAD OF HITTING EACH OTHER YOU'RE HITTING THE BALL
SO YOU TAKE THE BALL YOU TAKE YOUR RACKET YOU OPEN THE FACE AND YOU JUST BLOCK IT AGAINST THE WALL AND THAT'S A FOREHAND VOLLEY RIGHT THERE
IF IT FORCES ME TO PREPARE MY RACKET SO YOU SEE I HIT THE BALL I CAN HAVE THE RACKET JUST DROP THAT
YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE THIS A LITTLE MORE PRONOUNCED IN YOUR CAT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER TO SEE SO UNDERNEATH HERE I'M GOING TO HAVE SOME SHADOWING GOING ON UNDERNEATH THE BALL ON THE UNDERSIDE BUT I'M NOT GOING TO EXTEND ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP SO EXPERIMENTER HOWEVER YOU LIKE WITH THE SHADOWING
SO WHEN WE DO DRIBBLE WHEN IT'S OUR FRONT TO PLAYING A GAME AND WE GET THE BALL SOMEBODY ACTUALLY THROWS US THE BALL WILL WHAT WE DO
WE CAN SHOOT THE BALL WE CAN PASS THE BALL TO ONE OF OUR TEAMMATES OR WE CAN DRIBBLE
OK THEN WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE GLASS COVER ON THIS BALL AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR THREE TO FOUR HOURS AT LEAST
YOU DON'T WANT TO PALM THE BALL
FIRST THING YOU WANT TO CONSIDER IS JUST THE GRIP THE BALL
AND YOU KNOW MAYBE FIND THAT THE SEAMS AND THAT DEPENDING ON HOW BIG YOUR HANDS ARE OF YOU KNOW THE THUMB OF THE BALL OR THE THUMB ON ONE OF THE SEAMS AND THEN THE THREE AT LEAST THREE YOU KNOW OF YOUR FIRST FINGERS ON THE THE OUTSIDE OF THE SEAMS
WHEN YOU'RE SWIMMING AGGRESSIVELY IN COLOR AND A LOT OF TIME TO RESCUE SITUATION YOU NEED TO ACCESS MIDSTREAM BALL SIDE OF THE OR THE EIGHTIES
SO IF MY TEAM SERVES A BALL BUT AT THE OTHER TEAM GETS THE BALL AND IT PUTS IT INTO OUR SIDE OF THE COURT AND THEY GET THE POINT EVEN THOUGH THAT INSERT THE BALL AND VICE VERSA
AND SO YOU GET A DIFFERENT SAVE IT THERE WITH THE BALL YOU A LOT OF LONG SHOT
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO THROW THAT BALL UP IN OUR WORK AND HAVE IT LAND IN THIS HAND WITHOUT THAT MUCH TROUBLE
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO CREATE AN ARC SO THAT AT THE TOP OF THE BOX THE BALL GOES UP OVER IN AN ARC AND END UP IN YOUR OPPOSITE HAND
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS MUCH THE SAME WAY THAT WE'RE THROWING THE ONE BALL UP AND CATCHING IT IN THE SAME SPOT
NUMBER THREE GET YOUR HANDS IN FRONT OF THE BALL
IF YOU BOX OUT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE FEELING CONTACT FIRST BEFORE YOU GO FOR THE BALL
IF YOU JUST GO FOR THE BALL WITHOUT ESTABLISHING CONTACT ALL OF A REALLY SMART PLAYER LIKE MYSELF WILL SLIDE IN FRONT OF YOU MAY BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THE POSITION
YOUR CUE STICK WILL BE ELEVATED IN THE BACK THAT WHICH YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WILL MASS SAY A BALL IF YOU PUT ANY ENGLISH ON
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A BRIDGE THAT UP ON YOUR FINGERTIPS ARE SO THAT YOU'LL BE OVER THE BALL
NOW WHAT MAKES IT SO DIFFICULT IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE TO ELEVATE THE INTERVIEW CUE STICK IF YOU DO NOT HIT DEAD CENTER ON THE BALL WHATEVER ENGLISH IS THAT YOU WILL ACCIDENTALLY PUT ON THE CUE BALL WILL MAGNIFIED BECAUSE IT'LL BE A SLIGHT MASS SAY SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HIT THE CENTER OF THE BALL OR IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON USING THE ENGLISH TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALLOW FOR IT
OCCASIONALLY WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING IN YOU GET LEFT TO SHOCK WHERE THE CUE BALL IS CLOSE TO ANOTHER BALL OR YOU PLAY POSITION AND YOU HAVE PLAYED IT VERY WELL AND YOU'VE GOT TO SHOOT OVER A BALL
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO SHOOT OVER AN OBJECT BALL
AND THAT'S HOW YOU SHOOT OVER A BALL
SO NOW YOU TAKE YOUR STROKES AND YOU JUST SHOOT OVER THE BALL OR AND YOU MAKE THE BALL AND IN THE POCKET
THIS IS A VERY NICE BALL CRACK
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO HERE JONES IS GOING TO DO SOME MEDICINE BALL PUSH UPS WHY RYAN'S GOING TO DO SOME PUSHUPS USING THE TITLE BELLS JUST TO HELP THE RANGE OF MOTION IN HIS CHEST
BUT JONESY IS DOING HERE IS THAT HE'S PUSHING THE BALL BACK AND FORTH
FOR THE LONG TAIL TEST ON TAKE YOUR YARN AND GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF LENGTH TO THE SHORE IN PLACE THAT OVER YOUR THUMB AND THEN THE OTHER END ATTACHED TO THE BALL OVER YOUR POINTER FINGER
A FAKE IS AN INDIRECT ATTACK AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE EASIEST A BALL TECHNIQUE FAKE
BANK SHOTS ARE NOT ONLY PRETTY BUT THEY'RE EFFECTIVE AND THEY'RE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE SHOT WHEN YOU USE THEM PROPERLY THEN JUST SHOOTING THE BALL AROUND ON
SO GET ON THE BALL WITH THAT
YOU KNOW AN IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR GAME HAS GOT TO BE THE BALL HANDLING
AND WHENEVER YOU'RE DOING THOSE BOOK THAT BALL HANDLING YOU GOT TO DO DRILLS AND PRACTICE IN ORDER TO GET GOOD AT IT
HI I'M TRAVIS AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU JUST HOW TO PERFECT AND GET BETTER AT BALL HANDLING AND SEVEN MINUTES A DAY
ALRIGHT THE FIRST BALL HANDLING DRILLS GOING TO SHOW YOU IS ONCE YOU HAVE THE BALL YOU WANT TO TAKE THE BALL BRING IT DOWN BELOW YOUR ANKLES START DOWN BELOW YOUR ANKLES AND GO AROUND YOUR ANKLE WASTE HIT WASTE ANKLE WASTE PITCH WASTE ANKLE AND USE GO FASTER AND FASTER KIND OF LIKE THIS
NOW THIS IS A MEDIUM TO EASY BALL JUGGLING PATTERN WHEN YOU DO IT WITH THREE
ALL YOU'RE DOING INSTEAD OF CATCHING AND THROWING LIKE THIS IS GOING TO TURN YOUR HAND OVER AND GRAB THE BALL FROM THE TOP
JUST WORK ON THAT WITH BOTH HANDS AND EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE AT INTO YOUR THREE BALL PATTERN
FOR A DEEPER STRETCH PULL THE BALL UP TO YOUR LEG
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING A REALLY REALLY LARGE AREA IT'S GOING TO BE MORE ECONOMICAL TO PURCHASE IT IN BALL CAN HAVE IT DELIVERED TO YOUR HOME
SO IF YOUR BIG CAPTAIN COKE FAN USUALLY WHAT YOUR WRIST AND AS THE BALL ARE WHAT YOU SIMPLY HOME I WANT TO TRY OUT THE CAPTAIN PEPPERS FOR A LITTLE BIT OF SOMETHING DIFFERENT
TOSS THE BALL
THEY MALE TOSS THE BALL TO SOMEONE ELSE IN THE CIRCLE AND THEY HAVE THREE SECONDS TO COME UP WITH THE NUT THAT IS WHAT YOUR NAME
NOW THE OTHER TYPE OF BOW THAT YOU'LL SEE IS CALLED THE GERMAN BALL
TAKE OUR RIGHT FOOT UP AND TAKE THAT STRAP AROUND THE BALL THE FOOT AND THEN EQUALIZE THE LENGTH OF THE STRUT AND AS YOU EQUALIZE LIKE THE STRAP SECURE AROUND YOUR RIGHT HAND SO YOU HAVE A GOOD FIRM GRIP
KEEP YOUR BODY ALL THE WAY I STRAIGHT A BALL CONTRACTING MUSCLES
THE STABILITY BALL EXERCISE IS GOING TO TARGET THE OBLIQUES WHICH RUN ON THE SIDE OF THE WAYS
FOR THAT LIP TO WORK YOU NEED A HEAT BALL
THERE IS PROFESSIONAL PAINT BALL IS A DIFFERENT WAY CAUSE NOW TO HAVE FLAG
SO YOU GOT A SEVEN ON SEVEN YOU SHOOT EVERYBODY AND YOU GOT TO GRAB THEIR FLAG PUT ON THIS SIDE AND THEN THERE'S RECREATIONAL PAINT BALL WHICH IS JUST LIKE FAMILIES COMING OUT HERE SHOOTING EACH OTHER OF THE PLAY CAPTURE THE FLAG STUFF THAT BUT IT'S MOAN IT'S MAINLY IN THE NATION
AND FROM HERE I CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND STROKE THE BALL
REMEMBER OKAY WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING THE BALL ALRIGHT MAY SHOW ALRIGHT THEN IN THAT GRIP IN IT
SHADING ONTO THE ACTUAL EYE BALL
LET'S USE THE BLUE BALL
IF YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS REVERSED AND HE'S TRYING TO GIVE YOU A HAND OFF ON THE WRONG SIDE AND YOU GOT YOUR ELBOW OUT THERE CHANCES ARE YOU'RE GOING TO HIT WITH YOUR ARM AND YOU'RE GOING TO KNOCK THE BALL LOOSE FROM THE QUARTERBACK
ONE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE RIGHT OF WEIGHT TO WRAP UP THE BALL IF YOU TAKE THE THE HAND OFF IN THE WRONG WAY
THE SECOND WAY IS GOING TO BE HARD FOR THE QUARTERBACK TO GIVE YOU THE BALL IF YOU'RE NOT OPENED UP THE PROPER WAY
IT'S GOT TO BE OPEN SO THE QUARTERBACK AND SLIDE THE BALL IN
YOU STILL GOING TO USE THIS TECHNIQUE GETTING OFF THE BALL AND EVERYTHING BUT HE'S GOING TO DRAW A LINE STRAIGHT TO THAT FREE SAFETY WHICH IS CALLED STOCK BLOCKING
AND ON A FAST CLOTH LIKE THIS IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE HIT RIGHT IN THE CENTER AND SLIDE ALL THE WAY OVER THAT BALL AND STOP
SO BASICALLY NOW YOU'RE READY TO PRACTICE AND THROW A BALL
AND THE BALL COMES TO YOU YOU GOT A PERSON YOU TRY TO GO AROUND THEIR DEFENDER NOW YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO THE SIDE COME AROUND ON OUR EASE KIND OF YOU KNOW CUT BACK WHATEVER
SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR BALL IS GOING TO CUT OFF A THIRD OF IT
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT THE PICTURE FRAME ASIDE AND LET IT DRY SO I'M PLANNING A PROJECT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING A DIFFERENT TYPE OF DECORATION I'M GOING TO BE USING BEADS AND THAT'S REALLY THE LAST THING THAT WE NEED TO DO HERE SO THE BEATS DON'T REALLY NEED TO MUCH PREPARATION BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING DIFFERENT TYPES OF THE COLORS ARE IN THE KNEE TO CUT OUT SHAPES AND OR WHATEVER THE TYPE OF DECORATIONS YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO PREPARE BALL THE PICTURE FRAME IS DRAWING
THIS WORKS FOR US TO CLOSE TO THE MIDDLE OF THE BALL IS DEAD BEFORE IT'S TROLLING BASE WILL USUALLY CLEANED UP AND ALSO THE TOTAL CLEAN UP THE IF YOUR CARD IT TO A SPRAY PAINT
NOW IF YOU REMEMBER FROM BALL JUGGLING MULTIPLEX IS WHEN YOU THROW MORE THAN ONE BALL IT ONCE OR IN OUR CASE MORE THAN ONE CLUB AT ONCE
THE OTHER THING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO ESPECIALLY SUCH AS WITH THIS BARREL WHERE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN PAINT A BALL IS BROKEN AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU BRING ALL THAT DEBRIS OUT
SO I'M TRYING TO PICK A HIGH POINT IT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE BALL IN THE HOLE
JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF HOW HAT HOW HARD THE BALL NEEDS TO BE MOVING HERE FOR IT TO GET TO THE HOLE
THAT MAKES IT SO THE BALL JOINT ON THE UPPER SIDE WILL BOLT IN THROUGH YOUR CONTROL ARM BUSHING HOLES
IN ORDER TO DO THAT ON A FULL SIZE VEHICLE YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GET A BALL JOINT PRESS
I'M TWIST THAT WE NEED TO FIND THE HOP WEIGHT'S GOING TO BALL OVAL SHAPE
SO A COUPLE KEY POINTERS REMEMBER YOU'VE GOT YOUR NINETY DEGREE ANGLE IS WITH YOUR LOWER BODIES YOUR SHOULDERS AND YOUR HEAD TO STAY ON THE BALL
WE DON'T WANT TO BE UP HERE WHERE YOUR LOWER BACK IS ON THE BALL AS YOU'RE PUSHING UP BECAUSE IT'S GOT A LOT OF STRAIN IN YOUR NECK SO AS YOU'RE SETTING UP KEEP YOUR FREE WEIGHTS DOWN BY YOUR SIDES AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME FROM A SEATED POSITION TO ROLL YOURSELF ALL THE WAY DOWN UNTIL YOU FEEL YOUR HEAD AND YOUR SHOULDERS TOUCH THE BALL
YOUR LEFT SIDE YOUR WEAKER SIDE AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WEAKER IF YOUR ARE RIGHT HANDED TRY THROWING THE BALL LEFTY SEE HOW FAR IT GOES
AROUND IN A CIRCLE NICE AND CONTROL KEEPING THE BALL RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU
THE FIRST THING YOU CAN DO IS YOU DO BALL TOUCHES THE STANDING ON ONE SIDE OF THE BALL
THE FIRST DRILLS THAT WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF BALL TOUCHES DIFFERENT DIFFERENT MOVES
THE FIRST ONE IS JUST A SIMPLE BALL TOUCH RIGHT ON THE TOP OF THE BOWL
THE SECOND THING YOU CAN DO IT THIS IS GO AROUND THE BALL
AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU LEARN HOW TO CONTROL THE BALL TO LEARN HOW TO DRIBBLE
MOST THE OUTDOOR OUR ROLLER HOCKEY PLAYERS WOULD USE A BALL JUST LIKE THIS
BUT IT'S BASICALLY A BALL MOVES REALLY WELL OUT HERE
OUR SINCE WE'RE A OUTDOORS WHAT I GOT AS A MY ROLLER HOCKEY BALL
THAT GIVES YOU THE MOST OPTIONS IF YOU WANT TO GET A LOT OF LOFT ON THE BALL
SO IT'S A GREAT WEAPON AND BECAUSE IT'S SO LOFTED THOUGH IT DOES TAKE A LOT OF PRACTICE TO GET IT TO WHERE YOU HAVE GOOD CONTROL WITH IT BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE COMING UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND YOU'RE LEARNING TO POP IT UP TO A GOOD TO THE RIGHT DISTANCE SO YOU GOT TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THE SIXTY DEGREE CLUB BUT IT'S A GREAT CLUB AND LET'S SEE HOW IT GOES HERE
OKAY THE SIXTY DEGREE WEDGE IS REALLY LOFTED AND ONE THING I FORGOT TO MENTION PREVIOUS SEGMENTS MAYBE IS THAT IF YOU OPEN THE FACE YOUR CLUB IT DOES INCREASED THE LOFT OF WHICH MEANS IT PUTS THE BALL HIGHER
SO THE SIXTY DEGREE WEDGE IS ANOTHER WAY OF LOFTING THE BALL HIGH SO WHEN IT LANDS IT STOPS
THE NEXT ONE WOULD BE PROBABLY FIGURE EIGHT DRIBBLE WHICH TAKE THE BALL DRIBBLE BETWEEN YOUR LEGS IN THE SAME SAME MOTION
TRY TO THIRTY SECONDS ONE WAY AND THIRTY SECONDS THIRTY SECONDS AGAIN FOR THE FOR THE FINISH UP WRAP AND THE LAST ONE YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO TRY AND JUST GET ONE ONE BALL MAYBE HAVE A DEFENSIVE MAN AND WORK ON SIMPLY DRIBBLING
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW I MEAN THE FAST THE CLUB IS SPEED THE EASIER IT IS TO GET THE BALL UP IN THE AIR
AND BASICALLY THE REASON BEHIND THAT IS YOUR PUTTING SPIN ON THE GOLF BALL
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SIT BACK INSIDE SQUAT POSITION AND PUSH YOUR BALANCE AND PUSH YOUR MEDICINE BALL FORWARD
YOU RELAX YOUR SHOULDERS KEEP YOUR HEAD NICE AND LEVEL AND EXHALE AS YOU PUSH THE BALL AWAY FROM YOU
YOU WANT TO DO IS COME IN A NICE EVEN ANGLE WITH YOUR BALANCE TRAINER PLACE ONE FOOT AND TRY AND KEEP IT FAIRLY BALANCE IN THE CENTER OF YOUR BALANCE TRAINER BOTH HANDS ON YOUR MEDICINE BALL
I'VE SEEN SOME THAT ARE JUST REAL TIME YOU'LL WILL BALL OF OF A ARTIFICIAL FIREWOOD
AS YOU BRING THE BALL DOWN THE FLOOR YOU GOTTA GO AGGRESSIVELY TO TRY TO SCORE
NUMBER ONE REVERSE THE BALL IS THE KEY TO ANY PRESS SPRAY
OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO DIFFERENT SERVE WHICH IS THE WIDE SERVE SO MY GOAL IS TO HIT THE BALL SOMEWHERE I ABOVE MY RACK I'VE TO RIGHT HERE THE RED LINE THE REASON BEING IS WHEN THE BALL HITS IN THAT AREA BY THE OPPONENT DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF THE SHOT
THESE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE BALL OFF THE WALL OR YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET IT BEFORE BECAUSE THE WALL SO IF I HIT IT JUST RIGHT KEYS GET A VERY VERY WEAK SHOT SO
SO BY HITTING THE BALL UP HERE OVER MY OPPONENT IS FORCED TO TAKE THE BALL HIGH WITH HIS BACKHAND OR YOU JUST TAKE THE WRIST OF LETTING HIM COME OFF THE BACK WALL OR DYING BACK HERE SO THIS IS A VERY VERY EFFECTIVE SHOT SO ONCE YOU'VE MASTERED THE TECHNICAL SKILLS OF JUST HITTING THE BALL IN A DECENT MANNER YOU WANT TO START INCORPORATING HITTING IT TO SPOTS ON THE SIDE WALL TO MAKE YOUR SERVE THAT MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE
RIGHT LIKE THAT SO IF I DID BY KEEPING THE BALL BACK PART OF THE WALL THEY CAN'T ATTACK ME VERY MUCH I'LL USE THE BIG BALL
SO WHEN YOU'RE SERVING THE BALL TAKE THE BALL IN FRONT OF YOU TOSS IT IN FRONT OF YOU TAKE YOUR HAND BACK LEAD WITH YOUR ELBOW KEEP YOUR HAND OPEN AND SERVE THE BALL OVER THEM
AS YOU REPEAT THIS EXERCISE AND COME HERE YOUR MUSCLE MEMORY IS GOING TO START DEVELOPING THE HABIT OF HITTING DOWN AND KEEPING THE HANDS AHEAD OF THE CLUB AND IS GOING TO HELP YOU HAVE TO GET A MUCH BETTER CONTACT WITH THE GOLF BALL
MANY TIMES WE SEE AMATEURS JUST HITTING UP ON THE BALL AND HITTING WITH THE CLUB FACE IS THE HEAD OF THE HANDS AND THE WEIGHT REMAINS BACK IN INTO YOUR BACK LEG YOUR RIGHT LEG FOR RIGHT HANDED PLAYERS
THIS EFFECT BACK IS REALLY GOING TO TEACH YOU THE HABIT OF COMMON TO THE CORRECT IMPACT POSITION AND IF YOU NOTICE HERE MY WEIGHT IS WELL INTO MY LEFT SIDE THE CLUB FACE IS BEHIND MY HANDS SO MY HANDS HER HEAD AND IN THIS POSITION I'M ABLE TO HIT DOWN ON THE BALL
SO SOMETIMES IF ANYTHING IF YOU HOLD ANYTHING SOMETIMES BOWLING BALL IT ALL YOUR BALL THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE
GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT AROUND THE BLOCK TO VERIFY YOUR BALL JOINT REPLACED
SO HOLD ON TO THE BALL AS YOU SLOWLY WALK YOURSELF OUT
AGAIN IN THIS POSITION YOU WANT TO GET YOUR HEAD RESTING ON THE BALL AND NOT LET YOUR HIPS SAG SO YOU'RE GOING TO USE THE GLUTES TO CONTRACT TO LIFT THE HIPS AND HAVE YOUR HEAD IN LINE WITH YOUR SPINE
THEY WORK AND GET THE BALL OUT OF THE CLUB QUICK FORCING GRIP
SEE THAT THAT'S GOING TO HELP YOU STRONGLY RECOVER BACK CROSS TO BE ABLE TO ATTACK THE BALL
SEE HOW WIDE HIS FEET ARE ACTUALLY HITS THE BALL AND IT COMES BACK AROUND THERE
I BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR BOARD THE FUNNY BALL BUT YOU CAN TEACH SO ON HOW TO MAKE THIS INTO A CRACKED
IF THEY'RE NOT MADE FOR PAINT BALL YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO USE THEM
A LOT OF TIMES THAT COMES FROM A GUY THAT IS EITHER NOT LISTENING TO THE CADENCE HE'S NOT WATCHING THE BALL OR IT'S TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE BALL TO MAKE THE MISTAKE ANY JUMPS OFF SIDES PREMATURELY
THERE CAN BE OFF SIDES CALL AGAINST THE CENTER FOR MOVING OR WHAT WE CALL MANIPULATING THE BALL TO THROW OFF THE DEFENSE
SO A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS WHEN HE GOES DOWN ON THE BALL HE'S GOT TO GET SET
A LOT OF TIMES GO AHEAD AND LET THE BALL THE BALL WILL BE LAYING ON THE GROUND IT MAY EVEN BE TURN TO THE SIDE
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN OUR CENTER GOES DOWN TO SNAP THE BALL THAT WE DON'T GET ANY PENALTIES
HE'S ALLOWED TO GRAB THAT BALL AND GO AHEAD AND GET SET BUT ONCE HE GETS THAT BALL SET HE CAN'T BE MOVING IT
IT'S NOT JUST ADDING THE BALL BACK AND FORTH
THIS ALSO SPOT BULB WHICH MEANS IT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU A TIGHT BEAMS HEAT GOING STRAIGHT DOWN FROM THE BALL OKAY
AND NOW I AM THE PROPER DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE BALL
SO BASICALLY YOU'RE GOING AROUND LIKE THIS WITH YOUR THUMBS AT THE BOTTOM AND YOUR INDEX FINGER IS AT THE TOP PRESSING IN THE TOP OF THE BALL TO GIVE IT THE APPEARANCE OF THE MUSHROOM CAP
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO GO LIFTING YOUR HEELS UP LIKE THIS BUT YOU WANT TO FEEL THE PRESSURE OKAY ON THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT
SEE WHAT YOU LIKE THE BALL DATING AND FIND THINGS THAT YOU ENJOY DOING
NEXT YOU WANT TO APPLY HIGH QUALITY AFTERSHAVE BALL
THE BALL WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WHEN OUR QUARTERBACK TAKES A SNAP FIRST OF ALL HE'S GOING TO TURN AND HE'S GOING TO FAKE TO THE FULLBACK
SO GETTING THE GRIP RIGHT WILL ALLOW YOU TO HIT A BALL NICELY BUT A POUR GRIP WILL GIVE YOU ALL TYPES OF COMPENSATIONS BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT IS
THIS BALL IS COMING ANTES WE'RE NOT REALLY TRYING TO ALIGN WITH ANYTHING ELSE
AFTER THAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE GAMES ARE GOING TO PLAY LIKE A BALL NINE BALL ROTATION CUT THROAT AND CARNY BALL FINALLY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME FUN TRICK SHOTS THAT YOU CAN PLAY ON YOUR FRIENDS TO SHOW THEM THAT YOU HAVE MORE SKILLED AND YOU ACTUALLY HAVE
FOR EXAMPLE HOW TO PICK OUT A CUE HOW TO HOLD THE CUE HOW TO MAKE A BRIDGE SO THAT YOU CAN HIT THE CUE BALL HOW TO HIT THE CUE BALL DIFFERENT ENGLISH FOR THE CUE BALL
THERE'S A STRAIGHT IN SHOT THERE'S THE BANK SHOT THERE'S THE KICK SHOTS THERE'S A COMBINATION SHOT THERE'S A SHOT OFF ONE BALL THERE'S A SNOOKER SHOT THERE'S A SAFETY SHOT THEN THERE'S A SCRATCH SHOT
JUST LIKE THE THREE BALL MULTIPLEX START IT'S A COOL WAY TO START
THE FOUR BALL SIDE BY SIDE MULTIPLEX START
I JUST PINCH A SMALL AMOUNT OF CLAY OFF OF MY CLAY AND ROLL IT INTO A BALL AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE TO MAKE THE KNOB
PEOPLE USE THAT A LOT FOR DIFFERENT THREE BALL PATTERN
ROLL UP THAT BALL AGAIN
SO THE FILL UP ONE CUP WORTH OF WATER IN A MUD AND THEN SUBMERGE DIFFUSING BALL INSIDE THE CUP
THEY DON'T STOP THE BALL WITH THE TWO AND THAT WILL STOP THE FACT THAT THE INDOOR AFTER BOWLS OR AFTER A RED CARDS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
SO MY OBJECTIVE NOW IS COME OVER HERE WITH THE ANGLE THAT I NEED TO THEN KICK THE BALL INTO THIS POCKET
IT'S GOT A LITTLE COME ON A LITTLE COTTON BALL IMPROVE AT THE TOP OF LIKE A NEED ONE
SO LET'S SAY THE BALL IS UP LIKE ON THIS
NOW WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE TWIST JUST LIKE YOU HAVE AN ACTING YOU'RE CHOPPING WOULD YOU TO DO THE SAME THING WITH THE BALL AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME ACROSS THE BODY
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET A GOOD FEEL FOR THE BALL SO YOU GET THE BALL BACK AND FORTH RAISE IT UP HIGHER AND HIGHER
NEXT DRILL BE FOR BALL HANDLING ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF BALL HANDLING IS DRIBBLING
HE GETS THE BALL HITS THE BALL HIGH OFF THE FRONT WALL
SO LET'S SEE HOW HE GETS UNDERNEATH THE BALL
THE TOSS IS THAT MOST OF THE HEART OF THIS AND THEN MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS SO IF I'M BASICALLY WHAT YOU DO ON THIS BECAUSE YOU ARE THROWING THE BALL RIGHT WHERE YOU NEED IT TO BE YOU KNOW THE TO HEAT THE SHOT
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT YOU SELECT THE CAULKING THAT'S PAINT A BALL BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM HAVE SILICONE IN THEM AND THEY'RE NOT INTERVALS
NEXT IS THE CAPTIVE BEAT WITH CAPTIVE BEAD IS IT'S A SMALL HOOP WITH THE BALL IS SUSPENDED IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND THE BALL POPS RIGHT OUT AND SHOULD POP RIGHT BACK IN LIKE THIS
THE BALL SCREW ON AND OFF MUCH LIKE THE OTHER TWO
THIS IS JUST A FLAT BACK STUD WITH THE BALL THE SCREWS ON AND OFF
