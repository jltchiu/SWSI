FOR INSTANCE I LOOK UP A SHOE THAT I'M INTERESTED IN PURCHASING HERE ON A VERY POPULAR ONLINE RETAIL SITE IT'S ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS ALMOST BUT DIRECT FROM THE MANUFACTURER IT'S A ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS
AND I DID THAT WAY WRONG BUT YOU GET YOU GET MY DIRECT
THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS OF COURSE DIRECT YOUR DEMAND LETTER TO THE INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY THAT SHOWS YOU THE MONEY
BUT IF IT WHEN IT COMES TO THE POINT THAT YOU ACTUALLY NEED A RESTRAINING ORDER MANY MANY TIMES INDIVIDUALS IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT CAN ASSIST YOU ARE DIRECT YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO GO TO FILE FOR RESTRAINING OR
SO THIS IS ALMOST LIKE A NICE SOMEBODY PASTE AND YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT ON THE WHEEL WHEN THAT DON'T YOU CAN EITHER PEN FRY THIS FISH OR YOU CAN EITHER DIRECT THE PUT IT IN THE OLD ONE AND COOK IT DIRECTLY IN THE OVEN RIGHT
YOU WANT TO HAVE A STRAIGHT AND DIRECT A SIGNAL IS HUMANLY POSSIBLE OR DIGITALLY POSSIBLE
WHEN YOU PLAY A CARD AND YOU DIRECT IT TO A CREATURE CARD OR ANYTHING ON THE TABLE
THE BEST WAY TO FIND OUT HOW TO DIRECT THE PLAY TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT THE PLAY RIGHTS INTENTIONS WATER IS TO ANALYZE THE PLAY
YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT IT IN A HIGH TRAFFIC AREA DOUBLE STROKE ROLL THE FISH ALL THE TIME OR WHAT WE WILL RECEIVE DIRECT SUNLIGHT WHICH IS JUST RESULT OF DESIRABLE ALGAE GROWTH
CATCH THE MUSIC AND YOU WANT TO HAVE A REALLY DIRECT SIGNAL
SO JUST KEEP IN MIND AND YOUR FRONT FOOT FORWARD OR WHEREVER YOU WANT TO GO BECAUSE WE ARE FOOT'S THE DIRECT THE BOARDS AND SEND YOU
OR I MIGHT BE MORE IN DIRECT WOULD YOU RATHER WATCH TV RIGHT NOW
THE FIRST TIME YOU GO THROUGH IT YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND YOUR WAY BUT IT'S PRETTY PRETTY DIRECT
SO FROM HERE TO GET UP TO FLY LIKE THAT SO STARTING OUT WITH YOUR HIPS CLOSE TO THE WALL IN THE NORMAL OVERHANG CLIMBING POSITION PUSHING HARD OR THE LEGS AND USING YOUR ARMS TO DIRECT WE'RE GOING TO SEND YOUR FLYING IN THE DIRECTION YOU WANT TO GO
SO FROM HERE TO GET WAY OF THEIR I WANT TO USE MY LEGS FOR POWER AND MY ARMS TO DIRECT WHERE I'M GOING AND SOME POWER
THE SKILLS THAT WE'VE LEARNED IN THIS LESSON OR DIRECT FOUNDATION TO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE LEARNING IN THE NEXT LESSON WHICH IS THE ABOUT THE WEAVE
THE BETTER OF RESULT THAT WAY AND KEEP BREATHING VERY SLOWLY YOU DON'T WANT TO DIRECT THE WEIGHT UP AND DOWN YOU CONTROL THE WEIGHT DON'T LOOK THE WAY TO CONTROL YOU
THE AEROSOL SPRAYS ARE MUCH MUCH MORE DIRECT YOU CAN GET THEM EXACTLY THE PLACES YOU WANT TO GET THEM IN AND OUT AND THAT THEY'RE EASY TO CONTROL AND USE AS OUR THE POWDERS
OKAY NOW SO I'M GOING TO GO INTO THE DIRECT WHITE

SO THAT'S HOW I WOULD SET THAT UP SO YOU WANT TO THINK OF WHAT'S BEHIND THE SUBJECT AND HOW COMFORTABLE THEY'RE GOING TO BE SITTING IN THE DIRECT SUNLIGHT BECAUSE THEY MIGHT NOT WANT TO TALK FOR TWENTY MINUTES IF THEY'RE JUST SITTING UNBEARABLE HEAT
