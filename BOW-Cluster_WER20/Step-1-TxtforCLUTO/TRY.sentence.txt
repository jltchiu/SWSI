LETS IT THIS DOWN WE'LL GET AND I TRY TO THIS BOX WHICH IS PINK
WHAT I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE TO YOU NOW IS HOW TO DO AND I TRY TO IT
AND THIS GOES FROM A NICE PRETTY BLUE COLOR TO A PURPLE COLOR THAT WE HAVE HIGH NOT TRY IT'S IN THE TANK WHICH IS JUST THE BETTER THE FISH AS WELL AS THE AMMONIA GLASS SENSE
LET'S TRY THIS OUT OF
WE GET STUCK IN A RIP CURRENT THE BEST THING I CAN DO AS YELL FOR HELP WHICH IS HELP OR JUST SIT THERE AND DRIFT OUT OF THE RIP CURRENT AND THEN TRY TO SOME THE IMAGE
I STILL DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD WAY TO TO WARM UP AND TRY TO GET FOCUS TO GET IN THE RIGHT MODE FOR PLAYING
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF GETTING KIND OF LIGHT HEADED OR OR DIZZY JUST OFFER A COUPLE OF MINUTES THEN GO BACK AND TRY IT AGAIN
IF I WANT TO TRY DOWN OF THE FOURTEENTH OVERALL PICK LET'S SAY
SO I'M MIXING A LITTLE BIT OF THOSE RED AND YELLOW TOGETHER TO TRY TO GET A MIKE SOME SUNSET COLORS
WE'LL TRY THE OTHER SIDE JUST SO THAT WE'RE SURE THAT WE WERE CLEAR IN OUR DEMONSTRATION
ALSO WHEN YOU'RE CREATING YOUR CHARACTERS EITHER WANT TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING UNIQUE
OKAY WHEN YOU'RE SETTING UP TO CREATE YOUR CHARACTER CONCEPT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING THAT NOT ONLY APPEALS TO YOURSELF BUT WILL GO TO A WIDE VARIETY OF PEOPLE
TRY AND KEEP EVERYTHING TOGETHER
THEN WEEDS TRY TO MAKE TWO
TRY TAKING ONE BREATH AT EACH LEVEL
AS I'M MAKING THESE BOOKS I TRY NOT TO MAKE THE PICTURE TO OBVIOUS THAT THEY CAN JUST GUESS BY LOOKING AT THE PICTURES
I GRAB THAT AND I TRY AND FLATTEN IT OUT
I CAN THROW KNEES AND TRY TO LOCK DOWN AND SHOW IS FINISH IT UP OR UP MY OTHER OPTION IS TO STEP BEHIND
TODAY WE'LL TRY TO BREAK A BOARD
WE KNOW THAT IF YOU MAKE A LEGAL SHOT YOU GET TO SCORE AGAIN AND GETTING TO NEW TO KEEP PLAYING SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A SCENARIO WHERE I'M STRIPES AND THIS TWO BALLS LEFT THAT I'M STILL SHOOTING I COULD DO SOMETHING WHERE I CALL THE TWELVE BALL IN THE CORNER AND TRY TO STOP THE CUE BALL HERE BECAUSE AGAIN THESE ARE GOOD AS YOU LEARN FULL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN POSITIONING AND AGAIN THIS IS A DIFFERENT VIDEO WE ARE JUST LEARNING ABOUT THIS STRATEGY OF THE GAME AND TRY TO WIN THE GAME BUT ALL I WOULD MAKE THE TWELVE THE TEN AND NOW ALL MY BALLS ARE DONE
I WANT TO TRY TO BRING AS FEW COWS ISN'T AS I CAN SO THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORK QUITE SO HARD AT PROTECTING THAT IMPORTANT SPACE
LET'S TRY THAT ONE MORE TIME TO DRY
ONE THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TRY TO BORROW THINGS THAT YOU CAN RETURN OR BY CHEAP THINGS FROM THE THRIFT SHOPS AND THEN YOU DONATE THEM TO THE THRIFT SHOPS SO THAT YOU DON'T BUILD UP A HUGE INVENTORY OF THINGS
UNTIL SO REALLY TENDER IT'S NOT TRY AT ALL
TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT
TRY NOT TO HAVE THEM ON THE FLOOR IS THERE ON THE FLOOR ON YOUR STYLE YOU POINT AND THEN YOUR WEIGHT YOU MY STEP ON THEM ON HEIGHT YOURSELF
MY RIDER HAS MADE FREQUENT IT TENDS TO TRY TO CATCH HER HORSE
WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO SHOW WHAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO TO CATCH THAT HORSE THAT'S BECOME JUST A LITTLE BIT THIS OBEDIENT
AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS WHEN YOU DO IT IT WILL POP UP A WARNING EVERY TIME YOU TRY TO START THE APPLICATION
I'M GOING TO THEM SCRAP A GAME HERE RIGHT AT IT AND IF YOU JUST WANT TO SEE THAT A GAME THAT WAS WORKING OR ANY PROGRAM REALLY WASN'T WORKING BEFORE TRY IT OUT JUST RIGHT CLICK ON IT AND OR AS ADMINISTRATOR OBVIOUSLY I'M ASSUMING YOU HAVE FULL CONTROL THE MACHINE AND THE ADMINISTRATOR PASSWORD
A GOOD EXAMPLE THIS IS MOST VIDEO GAMES GENERALLY ASSUME THAT THEY HAVE FULL RANGE OF THE MACHINE GENERALLY THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY AND BAD ASSUMPTION BUT IT IS ANNOYING IN VISTA BECAUSE THIS INSTEAD OF SIMPLY ALLOWING THIS WILL TYPICALLY POP UP WARNINGS SO IN ORDER TO TRY IT OUT FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO BRING UP SOMETHING
ANYBODY WHO CAN PICK YOU JUST OVER THE TOP AND WATCHING BODY THAT PERSON AND AND TRY TO BE THEM
THAT'S EITHER DRIED OUT SO THAT THEN TRY TO DURING THE PACKAGE
IF THEY SOUND OUT CORRECTLY AND DON'T TRY TO GUESS THAT IT'S A REAL WORD AND YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE REALLY ISOLATING THOSE SKILLS
TRY THE OTHER HAND TO ONE TO STRAIGHTEN AGAIN GO ONE TWO
IF YOU CUT THE WHOLE FIRST AND THEN TRY TO MATCH IT CAN BE A LITTLE TRICKIER THAT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD
ONCE YOU TUBES AND THEY'RE ALL THE WAY TO GO AHEAD AND THEN TO REINSTALL YOUR TIRE THE REST THE WAY TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE USING ONLY YOUR HANDS BECAUSE YOU DO YOU TRY TO USE A SCREWDRIVER OR EVEN A TIRE LEVER SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR YOU CAN IN DEPTH PINCHING YOUR TUBE BETWEEN THE TIRE IN THE RIM WHICH IS THEN CALL THE PINCH FLAT
TRY TO ALWAYS GET IT TO THE OTHER PERSON'S CHEST AS FAST AS YOU CAN
IF YOU STAY THERE TRY TO BLOCK BOOM BOOM SAY ABOUT COMES RIGHT RIGHT BACK
AGAIN I'M GOING TO TRY TO USE THAT ARE A PROPER ADDITION GUNS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
BECAUSE REALLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS THAT INSTEAD OF TAKING A WHOLE CHORD AND TRY TO PRACTICE A WHOLE CHORD A BREAKING UP THE CHORD INTO DOUBLE STOPS
AS YOU CAN SEE IF I JUST TRY SCRATCHING IT NOW IT'S SIMPLY DUSTY AND MAKES A A SORT OF NASTY THAT LINE SO THAT WHEN IT'S LIKE THIS IT'S READY TO GO INTO THE KILN AND BE BISQUE FIRED WHICH IS THE FIRST STAGE OF THE FIRING PROCESS
THESE LOOK A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE TOUGHER STUFF ON IT TO TAKE ON JUST SOME WATER AND ADD SOME BLEACH OR ANOTHER DISINFECTANT LIKE ABOUT TEN PERCENT AND I COULD SO THESE TOOLS FOR ABOUT FIVE OR TEN MINUTES AND THEY'LL BE NICE AND CLEAN FOR ONE I WANT TO USE ON THIS WHEN I'M DONE JUST TRY IT OFF BECAUSE THE PLANT THEY DON'T LIKE DISINFECTANT THAT ONLY BLEACH SO THAT NOW THERE SHOULD BE CLEAN AND SANITARY PRESCIENT
AND THEN YOU KNOW TRY AND GET TO THE BACK OF THE SHOULDER A LITTLE BIT AS WELL AND THEN WORK YOUR WAY BACK DOWN AND YOU KNOW FINISH AT THE HAND NICE GENTLE MASSAGE TOUCHED ON THE HAND
AGAIN WE WANT TO DO REPS TO SELL YOUR ON THIS ONE BECAUSE EIGHT TO TWELVE REPS ISN'T ENOUGH PROBABLY FOR YOU SO JUST TRY TO BUILD IT UP ONE REP AT A TIME DO TWO TO THREE SETS AND THAT'S HOW WE DO OUR TOUCHING GO SQUATS
AND YOU WANT TO TRY TO GET IT IN A VERY THIN LINE YOU DON'T WANT IT TOO THICK
THEY'LL FREEZE TO THE SIDES OF YOUR BAIT BUCKET TO THE TOP AND THEN WHEN YOU TRY TO REMOVE THEM ALL THAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS YOUR NETTING REPS AND YOU HAVE TO GO BY ANOTHER ONE
I WOULD TRY AND STICK WITH A MEDIUM GOLDEN SHADE SO BECAUSE IF YOU DO TO ASH IT MAY COME UP GREEN AND IF YOU DO TO WARM IT MAY COME UP A LITTLE BRASSY
AND THE PART THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SHOULDER PADS YOU WANT TO TRY TO GET YOUR HANDS LOCKED INTO THERE SO THAT YOU HAVE THE LEVERAGE
IF YOU FEEL HEAT IN THE JOINT YOU MAY FIND THAT THE DOG WILL ALSO OBJECTIVE IT AND IN THIS CASE IS JUST DON'T DO AS MUCH OF IT JUST DO A MINUTE OR TWO SEE LITTLE TOLERATE AND THEN TRY AGAIN THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE DOING A SESSION AND GRADUALLY WORK YOUR WAY UP YOU'LL FIND THAT THIS WILL GET EASIER AS YOU'VE WORKED WITH THE ANIMAL AND THE GENERAL ENERGY IS FLOWING AND SOME OF THE STIFFNESS IS RELIEVED THEN THEY'RE GOING TO BE MORE LIKELY TO TOLERATE THIS PARTICULAR AREA BEING MASSAGE
TRY A COUPLE OF THEM OUT DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO STICK TO THE FIRST ONE YOU FINE
BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO GET AS MUCH SPEED AND FOLLOW THROUGH ON THIS SHOT AS POSSIBLE
THE REASON THAT IS BECAUSE TURTLES DO HAVE A TEN SOMETIMES TO LIKE TO TRY TO EAT GRAVEL
NOW AS YOU EVENTUALLY GET GOOD ENOUGH TO HOLD THIS FOR A LONG WHILE YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY MANIPULATING IT IN CERTAIN WAYS
ONE OF THE KEY THINGS TO TO THINK ABOUT IS YOU WANT TO TRY AND WIND UP THE STRING WITH THE ENGINEER WHIST KIND
AS SOON AS IT FEELS LIKE IT'S GOING TO STICK IT GOING TO TAKE THIS FLAP AND BEND IT BACKWARDS AND THEN PUT YOUR NAIL IN THERE AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO IS GET THIS PAPER TO GO RIGHT INSIDE THAT GROOVE
SO I'M GOING TO WHAT I'M DOING THAT I'M GOING TO SPREAD THE FIRE OR SPREAD THE THE COALS AROUND A LITTLE BIT AND TRY TO REALLY KEEP SEARCHING FOR THE STUFF THAT STILL HOT STILL BURNING WE'RE GOING TO SPREAD IT AROUND AS MUCH AS I CAN KEEPING IT WITHIN THE PIT THE WHOLE TIME
SO WE'LL START OVER NOW AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO PUT TOGETHER THE KIND OF TEAMWORK THAT WOULD BRING US TO A VERY QUICK FINISH AND BE WITHIN THAT SIXTY SECONDS
I HAVE ANOTHER ANOTHER FAVOR KEY THAT I LIKE TO PLAY IT BUT YOU KNOW YOU TRY TO PLAY IN ALL THE KEYS
SO WHEN YOU DROP IN GO OVER ACROSS THE SPINE AND THEN COME DOWN PLACE YOUR TIRE JUST RIGHT NOW WE'RE READY TO TRAP AND GIVE IT A TRY
NOW IF YOU'RE NOT A FAN OF SPICY FOOD I WOULD REALLY WORRY ABOUT THIS THAT MUCH BECAUSE ALL OF THE OTHER FLAVORS IN THE SPICES ARE REALLY GOING TO TRY AND COULD HIT YOU IN THE BACK OF YOUR THROAT NOT REALLY IN THE FRONT OF YOUR TARGET BURN YOUR MOUTH PLUS IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE IN A CREAM SAUCE AND THAT WILL MELT WITHOUT EVEN FOR
SO KIND OF COUGH CAN BE SOMETHING THAT'S FAIRLY MILD IN DOGS GET OVER THE DAY OR TWO AND IT CAN BE SOMETHING THAT WILL CAUSE YOUR DOG TO WIND UP IN A HOSPITAL FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND WE JUST TALKED ABOUT A COUPLE OF THINGS YOU CAN DO TO TRY TO HELP CARE FOR THEM
NOW THAT WE WANT TO TRY TO LURE OUT THE GROUPS INDIVIDUALLY AS MUCH AS WE CAN BECAUSE THEY GET MUCH MORE POWERFUL WHEN THEY'RE WORKING IN A GROUP
AND I TRY TO GET ANY EXCESS FITS ON THE INSIDE OF THE BULBS
BUT FOR RIGHT NOW LET'S JUST TRY IT WITH THE TOE WERE CHEATING SO REMEMBER WHEN WE STOP CHEATING YOU CAN DO THIS ANYMORE OKAY
SO BECAUSE THESE IT WITH A REALLY YOUNG THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE GOING TO IMMEDIATELY START GOING OUTSIDE AND SO IF THEY ARE GOING INSIDE AND GET THEM TO TRY TO GO ON A NEWSPAPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WHENEVER YOU'RE IN A RESCUE SITUATION YOU WANT TO TRY TO KEEP YOURSELF REMOVED FROM THE RIVER WITHOUT PUTTING YOURSELF TOO MUCH IN DANGER
NOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL BRAVE JUST SPRAY RIGHT ALONG DOWN THE BRAID AND THEN RUB IT DOWN JUST TO TRY TO GET THOSE LITTLE STRAY HAIRS
SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS TOP TRY TO TAKE THIS TO MY WORK TABLE HERE AND JUST BY PICKING IT UP I CAN TELL THAT IT'S GOT A GOOD SOLID SHAPE GOOD SOLID FORM IS NOT BOTTOM HEAVY IT'S NOT TOP HEAVY AND BASICALLY IT'S SCREAMING AT ME TO MAKE IT KIND OF SQUARE
SO WHEN YOU'RE CAMPING IN AN AREA THAT GETS USED A LOT YOU WANT TO TRY TO RESTRING RESTRICT YOU'RE CAMPING ACTIVITY TO THE AREAS THAT ARE ALREADY CAMPED IN THAT ARE ALREADY BEEN DESIGNATED AS CAMPSITES
AGAIN OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO USE THE SITE OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE A ENJOY THIS SAME EXPERIENCE YOU GET TO ENJOY AND SO ONE MORE HEAVILY USED AREAS TRY TO FIND AREAS THAT ARE ALREADY IMPACTED AND THAT ALREADY USED FOR CAMPING AND TRY TO RECAP IN THOSE AREAS RESPECTFULLY AND USE THEM AND I'VE BEEN A GOOD WAY AND HOPEFULLY WHEN YOU COME BACK THEY'LL BE AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO USE THE NEXT TIME
SO YOU'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE AT A MARTIAL ART STUDIO OR IF YOU'RE JUST AT YOUR HOUSE TO BE HAVING FRIENDS YOU GO AND TRY TO TRY TO GO WITH EACH FRIEND AND TRY TO SEE WHO'S GOING TO BE THE BEST IT FOR YOU
AND THAT'S A REALLY COMMON THING FOR PEOPLE TO DO A NICE TO DO THAT TOO BUT A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU DO THAT IT PUSHES THE LIP COLOR OUT AND YOU END UP HAVING TO APPLY IT MANY MORE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY SO TRY TO JUST GET USED TO PRESSING TOGETHER GOING PRESS AGAIN AND IT'S GOING TO HELP TO BLEND ALL THAT COLOR TOGETHER BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO MOVE YOUR GLOSS
SO TRY TO DO IS I TRY TO JUST YOU KNOW JUST I JUST ALL JUST PUNCH A SMALL HOLE
YOU CAN SEE HOW LOOSE THAT FALLS ON ME SOMEBODY TRY TO PULL ME AND I BASICALLY THE PFD WOULD COME RIGHT OFF SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE NICE AND SNUG AND MAKE SURE IT FITS SMOOTHLY
ALRIGHT NOW THAT WE KNOW HOW TO SPIN ARE POI FORWARD AND BACKWARD LET'S TRY A FUN LITTLE TRICK THAT LETS YOU SWITCH FROM GOING FORWARD TO BACKWARDS
THIS IS AN INSTANCE WHERE KEEPING YOUR BRAIN OUT OF IT IS ACTUALLY EASIER THAN IF YOU TRY AND THINK ABOUT IT TOO HARD
AND THEN I TRY TO DO IS THE SAME TREES ROOMS WITH MY LEFT HAND AS WELL
AND I'M GOING TO DO THE SAME THING OVER HERE WE HAVE AND TRY AND START TO READ FORM RE SHAVE THE EDGE OF OUR POT IN THE FOREGROUND
THE FUN THINGS ABOUT A CONVENTION ARE THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO TRY TO HAVE AS MUCH OF A GOOD TIME IS EVERYONE ELSE
NOW I WANT TO TRY TO ANGLE UP HERE BUT HE MAY NOT MAKE THAT SO EASY FOR ME SO I CAN EASILY TRANSITIONS THE SECOND SUBMISSION TOLL FROM HERE AGAINST MY HIP
WHEN YOU GET CLOSE TO THE TOP IT IT'LL BREAK OFF WHEN YOU TRY AND DO THAT
WE TRY TO RELAX WITH
I WANT TO TRY TO TOUCH MY HEAD TO HIS HEAD
I'M PASSING AND THE TOSS IS GOING TO PASS IT TO THE PAT TOSS IT TO THE PASSER AND THEN THE PASS OR WILL USE THEIR LEGS KEEP THEIR BUT DOWN FACE THAT TARGET TO TRY TO GET INTO THE TARGET
SO LET'S TRY THAT WITH THE DRUM
I'M WATCHING HIM RIGHT HERE I'M WATCHING THE TOP OF HIS CHEST I'M NOT REALLY LOOKING IN HIS EYES BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES THEY CAN FAKE YOU OUT AND TRY TO LOOK LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO HIT YOU SOMEWHERE
TRY TO GO GENTLY DOWN
THE DOUBLE OVERLAP IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN TRY SOMETHING YOU COULD GET AROUND WITH ESPECIALLY IF YOU FEEL THAT YOUR TWO HANDS INTO WRIST THE
DON'T TRY TO KEEP YOUR ELBOWS FAIRLY CLOSE
WE IS A LOT OF HOMEMADE AT CLEANING SUPPLIES THINGS THAT WE PUT TOGETHER AND USE YOU KNOW FOR GLASS CLEANER FOR INSTANCE I USE A MIXTURE OF VINEGAR DISH SOAP AND WATER AND I HAVE TRIED ALL SORTS OF GLASS CLEANERS AND NOTHING WORKS BETTER THAN THIS AND SO WE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE JUST OVER TIME TRY AND YOU KNOW TRIAL AND ERROR TYPE THINGS THAT WE HAVE FOUND THAT WORK BEST FOR YOU KNOW FOR CLEANING THAT MAY BE IS UNCONVENTIONAL SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT USING AND WE USE THAT FOR YOU KNOW GENERAL CLEANING AS WELL COUNTER TOPS AND STAINLESS STEEL AND IT LEAVES A REALLY A SPARKLING SHINE AND NO STREAKS AND IT'S REALLY AWESOME
TRY TO KEEP THE STANDING LEG VERY STILL YOU DON'T WANT TO GET A BOUNCE INTO IT
THE NEXT STEP YOU WANT TO TAKE IT UP THE MOUNTAIN AND TRY IT GOING DOWN A LITTLE SLOW
THE TIME BEING SORE I WILL BE TRY TO ESCAPE FROM THIS
MAKE SURE YOU TRY TO TURN YOUR CELL PHONE ON VIBRATE OR SILENT OR EVEN OFF
I HAVE A SENSE OF HOW FAST IT WOULD BE FROM HALF WAY AND THEN I TRY TO POT IT TO THAT HALFWAY POINT WITH THE RIGHT SPEED
IF WE USED OUR ALPHABET POSTERS IF WE TOOK THE TIME WITH PHONEMIC AWARENESS IF WE ASK THEM TO LOOK AT OUR MOUSE AND TRY TO PRACTICE BY HOW WE'RE MAKING SOUNDS THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SOUNDS AND SPOKEN LANGUAGE
SO LET'S TRY NICE SPACE FOR THE SUBJECT AND YOU CAN WRITE WHATEVER YOU WANT ANY UPDATES ON FAMILY THINGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND SO I'M JUST GOING TO TYPE IN A LITTLE THING RIGHT HERE AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE DONE TYPING THE BODY OF YOUR BOWL OF TEN GO AHEAD AND COME DOWN HERE
TRY TO CREATE THE SITUATION SITUATED IS POSITIVE AND THE BIRD WANTS TO INTERACT ON SO THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BITE YOU INSTEAD
I TRY IT AGAIN
I SELECT CONVERT TO REAL INSTRUMENT OKAY NOW LET'S TRY IT OUT SO THERE'S THIS LOOP RIGHT HERE THAT I WANT TO USE A OKAY SO I CLICK IT AND DRAG IT OVER HERE AND NOW AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S BLUE NOT GREEN
I ALSO TRY TO SEE ORGANIZE AND PUT THEM IN ORDER
THE STANDING POSES YOU'RE GOING TO WORK TO TRY TO STAY IN YOUR POSE IS UP TO TWO MINUTES LEARNING TO BREATH LEARNING TO RELAX AND ENJOY
I'M FOLDING CLOSED TODAY TO MAKE THEM GO INTO A SUITCASE AND TO TRY TO KEEP THEM SOMEWHAT WRINKLE FREE
THIS IS A MAN'S SHIRT WITH SHORT SLEEVES AND FIRST THING I DO IS GO FOR THE CORNERS OF THE SHOULDERS AND THEN I FOLD IT TOWARDS IT'S BACK AND I PUT MY FINGER IN THE COLLAR PULL THE COLLAR UP GRAB FOR THE TOP PARTS OF THE SLEEVES AND TRY AND SHAKE IT OUT A LITTLE BIT AND THEN I LAY IT DOWN ON A FLAT SURFACE I TRY AND FIND WHERE THERE'S SOME PROBLEM AREAS WITH WRINKLES AND STRETCH IT OUT SO THAT THE UNDER OUR PITSTICK SEAMS ARE TOGETHER AND THE SIDES ARE TOGETHER AND THAT THE TAIL AS STRAIGHT JUST TO TRY AND PREVENT CREATING NEW WRINKLES
SO YOU'RE GOING TO LINE UP LIKE YOU TO NORMAL SHOT BUT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT BEING SUPER RELAX BECAUSE YOU CAN IF YOU TRY TO MUSCLE THIS BALL BALL WHAT HAPPENS IS OFF HARD PAN THE CLUB HITS THE HARD PAN AND THEN SKIPS INTO THE BACK OF THE BALL PRODUCING A SKULL SHOT
WE'RE JUST GOING TO TRY TO KEEP IT SIMPLE IN THIS CLIP
ONE MORE TRY TO GET IT JUST LIKE THAT
SO BASICALLY WHAT IT IS IS IT'S TWO PLAYERS TO TURN THEIR STICKS OF WITH THE BACKS TOWARDS EACH OTHER WITH THE BALL IN THE MIDDLE AND YOU HAVE BOTH HANDS ON THE STICK THEM TO DO WITHOUT THE BALL AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GET UP UNDERNEATH THE BALL AND FLING THE BALL ABOVE YOUR HEADS AND THEN ALL THE THAT TEAMMATES KIND OF MOVING TO TRY TO GET THE BALL AND GRAB POSSESSION
I PUT ALL MY BODY WEIGHT INTO THAT AND I TRY TO TRANSFER IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE HEEL OF MY LEFT HAND
SO IF YOU'RE NOT THROUGH YOU JUST HAVE TO TRY TO TRY TO DRY
THE OVERHEAD PASS IS EFFECTIVE DURING THE GAME WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF SPACE BETWEEN YOU AND THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PASS IT TO AND YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO GET IN THERE WITH SOME ZIP SO THAT THE DEFENSE DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO GET IN BETWEEN AND TRY TO STEAL THE BALL
WE'RE GOING TO TRY FOR ARTICLES NOW
THIS ONE BECAUSE THIS IS MORE MUSCLE YOU GOT TO TRY TO CONTINUE WORKING OUT THE HEAD AND ALL THE QUICK AS POSSIBLE ALL A LESS REST
WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR FEET TOGETHER YOU TRY TO DRAWING THE TOES TOGETHER THE BALL OFF WITH THE HEEL LOOK FOR
IDEALLY YOU TRY TO CONNECT TO THE TOES BUT IF NEED BE TOUCH THE ARCH THE FOUR
THEY'LL START ON ONE THEY CHOSE FROM THE AUDIENCE LIKE SAY L AND THEY'LL GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH FROM AN OIL BACK AROUND THROUGH Z IN A ALL THE WAY BACK TO L AND THEN THEY'LL TRY AND FINISH GOING BACKWARDS FROM L
YOU SHOULD REALLY TRY TO MAKE A SEPARATE CUT FOR EACH OF THOSE
JUST SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU CAN KEEP KIND OF KEEPING YOUR REPERTOIRE WHENEVER YOU'RE LOOKING AT AN AD AND LOOKING AT A MAN THAT IT'S QUITE A DISTANCE FROM YOU AND YOU WANT TO PASS IT TO A WITHOUT THE DEFENSE COMING IN TO TRY TO STEAL
TRY NOT TO WASTE ANYTHING
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY TO DO IS I'M GOING TO KEEP MY HANDS ARE WELL BACK OF EVERYTHING
IF YOU TRY TO DO THIS ALL ONCE IT'S REALLY EASY AND THIS MOTION THE TRICK TO FALL OFF AND THE DATE AND GET OUT OF POSITION
NOW BUT IF YOU CAN TRY TO LOOSEN UP AS TO HOW YOU'RE STANDING
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE ALWAYS STRUGGLING AND IT'S AN UPHILL BATTLE TO TRY AND GET PEOPLE WHAT THEY NEED AND THE THAT CAN KIND OF DRAG IT DOWN SOME DAYS
SO EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE THEORETICALLY IN FRONT OF THIS LINE SO WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO CHILLED EACH OTHER BOAT WE HAVE TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN THE FRONT COURT
LET'S TRY FOLK LYRIC MOVE CALLED THE HIP PULL
OKAY SO LET'S TRY IT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH OUR TOE WAY TO PICK IT UP YOU'RE JUST GOING TO JUMP DON'T CHEAT IT BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS GO LIKE THIS AND THAT WOULD NOT OVER THE TOP THAT WAS ACROSS THE SIDE
SO LET'S TRY IT TOGETHER BACK TOGETHER BRUSH HEEL TOE OVER THE TOP
TAKING THAT SAME WIRE WHAT I'VE DONE IS A CUT IT IN PIECES WE'RE AND BEND IT AROUND SO THAT YOU HAVE TO USE A CLAMP AND I TRY TO ATTACH IT WHERE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SEEN BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE'VE COVERED THIS WITH THE SILK FLOWERS I NEED TO PUT THE HOLE IN THE FLOWERS WITH AN EXACTO KNIFE TO GET IT DOWN IN THERE
BASICALLY TRY TO MINIMIZE THE OF THE IMPACT SO THAT THE CAMPSITE LOOKS AND AND IT IS THE WAY IS AS MUCH AS MUCH THE WAY YOU FOUND IT AS POSSIBLE WHEN YOU'RE DONE
IT'S JUST YOU KNOW TRY TO TRY TO RESTORE SOME OF THAT GROUND COVER BACK THAT WAY IT WAS AND IF YOU'VE MOVE LOGS IF YOU'VE USED LOGS TO SIT ON AROUND A CAMPFIRE IF YOU USE THEM TO SIT ON AS A KID AS CAMP STOOLS AND TRY TO MOVE THOSE BACK TO WHERE YOU FOUND THE MORE YOU DON'T PUT IT BACK OUT IN THE WOOD SO THEY'RE NOT AN OBVIOUS PATTERN THAT YOU'VE CREATED
AND YOU WANT TO TRY TO FIND A QUIET PLACE
SO A SETTING DRILLS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A TALL CIRCLE TOSS TO THE BALL AND YOU GET UNDER IT USE YOUR LEGS FACE YOUR TARGET AND YOU WANT TO PUSH THE BALL OUT WITH YOUR LIGHT NOT ONLY ARREST BUT YOUR LEGS ALSO AND FACE YOUR TARGET AND TRY TO GET IN THE TARGET
TRY TO KEEP YOUR NECK RELAXED
YOU ALWAYS WANT TO WORK IT UP WHEN YOU START IN THIS AREA AND YOU TRY TO GET AS MUCH AS YOU CAN TOWARDS THE BOTTOM
SO THE WAX PLAYING THIS TO PEOPLE AS DON'T EVER TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHICH HAD IS WHAT NUMBER
THEN WE GO INTO THE WATER WE TRY IT AND IF I NOTICED THAT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO DO IT IF I NOTICED THAT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO DO IT THEY WILL GET BACK OUT OF THE WATER AND DO IT AGAIN
A LOT OF PEOPLE TRY TO START THERE FOR REAL ALREADY IN SQUATS WHICH IS A LOT HARDER AND IT DEFINITELY AND ITSELF TO PROGRESSION MARY EVENLY
IF YOUR HOME JUST AGAIN TRY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
THEN YOU TAKE THE OTHER PART OF THE HAIR BY HOLDING YOUR HAND HERE OKAY AND IF YOU WERE HOME YOU HOLD IT HERE AND YOU TRY TO GET AROUND THIS REALLY DIFFICULT TO TRY YOUR BEST
IF NECESSARY TRY A LITTLE
I'M GOING TO WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THE CONTAINER THAT YOU HAVE THE FLOWERS IN IS FILLED WITH WATER EVERY DAY BECAUSE THE FLOWERS WILL DRINK WATER IN A THEY'LL TRY A LITTLE BIT EACH DAY
SO WHAT HE'S GOING TO TRY TO DO IS HE'S GOING TO TRY TO WALK HIMSELF AROUND IN PURSUE TO THIS RUNNING BACK COMING ACROSS
WHAT MOST PEOPLE TRY TO DO IS BRING THEIR SHOULDERS WAY FORWARD AND THIS CAN CAUSE ROTATOR CUFF ISSUES ALL KINDS OF BAD PROBLEMS
SO WHEN YOU CAN USE A STRAP IT CAN REALLY PUT YOU IN THE PERFECT ALIGNMENT AND I RECOMMEND ANYBODY IN MY HOW PERFECT YOUR CHILD A RUN THAT DONE THUS AND MAYBE TO TRY IT THIS WAY JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN THE PROPER ALIGNMENT
THEN WE CAN TRY THIS AGAIN
SO IF I WANT TO GO OVER HERE AND TRY TO FIND A VALUE THAT WOULD WORK WELL WITH THIS I'M PROBABLY GOING TO LEAN TOWARDS THIS SILVER FLASHY DRESS
NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO NEXT IS I WANT TO TRY TO COPY SOME PATTERNS WANT TO DO IS I'M GOING TO GRAB MY MY CONTROL BUTTON AND HOLD ON PATROL AND COPY THIS PATTERN SO THIS PATTERN AND NOW IT'S JUST COPIED NOW INTO THE ON PLACE IT TO IT AND VIDEO WE'LL PART OR PUT IT IN PLACE IT OVER SOMETHING AND WE'LL GO TO MY D SHARP ACTUALLY WHAT I'M GOING TO GO TO MY F SHARP THE NEXT ONE UP AND PASTE IT RIGHT OVER
YOU WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF YOU WANT TO KNOW OF WHAT'S UP ABOVE YOU BEFORE YOU TAKE YOUR LADDER AND JUST AND TRY TO PUT IN A POSITION BECAUSE YOU MIGHT FIND THAT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO DO IT WITHOUT DAMAGING SOMETHING
SO A GOOD SHOULDER FAKE FRONT SHOULDER FAKE HANDLES HALFWAY OUT SHOULDER SNAPS I STEP IN AND I'M LOOKING LIKE I'M GOING TO TRY TO THEM
I MIGHT TRY TO PAY OVER THE BLADE
SO LET'S TRY IT WITH THE ARMS
I'M JUST GOING TO TRY TO GET IT ALL AROUND
GET THAT WILL MIX AND TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT NUTMEG GETS MIXED ALL IN REALLY GOOD
OKAY TRY THAT AGAIN
SO JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU USE A CONDITIONER IN THE SHOWER AFTER YOU SHAMPOO SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO TANGLES AND IF IT'S REALLY BAD A LEAVE IN CONDITIONER BEFORE YOU STYLE AND THEN AGAIN YOU COULD TRY STATIC GUARD HAIRSPRAY WATER
NOW THAT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE IF I'M ROLLING MY BRUSH ON IN THE PAINT TO TRY TO GET A NICE POINT ON BECAUSE MY SURFER GUY IS GOING TO HAVE SPIKY HERE
YOU JUST WANT TO KEEP YOUR BRANCHES WILL THEN YOU CAN AND TRY TO REALLY CAREFUL AND NOT TO MAKE A BIG BLOB BECAUSE IF YOU DO TOO MUCH PAINT ON THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NOT HAVE A MUCH DETAIL
SO IT'S CRITICAL TO TRY AND BACK LIGHT JEWELRY IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET A PURE WHITE BACKGROUND AND THE WAY OF DOING THAT THAT I THINK THE BEST WAY OF DOING THAT IS A PIECE OF CLEAR WHITE PLEXIGLASS IT'S GOING TO ALLOW THE LIGHT TO COME THROUGH AND GIVE YOU THAT WHITE BACKGROUND WITHOUT OVEREXPOSING THE JEWELRY ITSELF
WHEN YOU GET IT IN ONE HAND THEN TRY IN THE ONE HANDED ARC ONCE AGAIN
I DON'T WANT YOU TO TRY TO FOR FIVE SECONDS
HERE I KIND OF STARTED NOT HAVING MANY BOOKS AND SO I A LOT OF TIMES I DON'T DO THIS ARE REALLY CONTINUE LIKING BOOKS BUT I USE BIG PIECES THAT I JUST TRY TO MAKE IT INTERESTING OLD FAMILY BASKET WITH A PICTURE IN IT RUSTED GORDON PIECE THAT I BROUGHT IN BUT YOU'LL SEE THAT I HAVE MOSTLY BIGGER PIECES UP HERE
NOW THE FOOT IS JUST GOING TO BE VERY RELAXED YOU'RE NOT GOING TO REALLY TRY TO DO MUCH WITH THAT AT ALL
SO TRY THAT AGAIN SIX UP POSITION
THEY SHOULD TRY AND REALLY BE CLOSE TO THE SAME RHYTHM
YOU WANT TO TRY AND KEEP IT RIGHT ON WITH
TRY AND TOTALLY RELAX THE SHOULDERS
LET'S TRY GREEN THERE WE GO
DON'T TRY TO SING YOU KNOW YOUR AUDITION PER AMERICAN IDLE IF YOU'VE NEVER SOME BEFORE YOUR WHOLE LIFE
SO YOU GOT TO DO YOUR BEST NOT TO HAVE THE A AND ARE THE PARTING TOOL IN A LOT OF CASES OF FRUSTRATED ARTISTS TRY TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING
THE LABELS WILL TRY TO TURN YOU INTO WHATEVER THEY THINK YOU SHOULD BE IN THAT AND IT WILL NOT OF A OF A SERVE YOU WRITE IT
A TRUE YES YOU NEED TO HIT SINGLE AND THIS MARKETPLACE TODAY BECAUSE IT'S MORE ABOUT TRACKS THAT IS ABOUT ALBUMS BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU NEED TO NOT CHANGE WHO YOU ARE TO GET SIGN OR TO YOU KNOW TRY TO SELL YOUR MUSIC
SO THIS IS A TOUGH WIDE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GET YOU DO HAVE TO TRY TO GET UNDERNEATH THE BALL A LITTLE BIT TO GET IT UP
IF YOUR HAIR IS NOT ALREADY CURLY TRY USING A CURLING IRON
WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO KEEP GETTING THAT GOOD TONE EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T HAVE THE STRING TO SNAP INTO
WHEN YOU GET TO THE E STRING YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO KEEP YOUR THUMB THERE ON THE FINGERBOARD
WHEN YOU'RE TRAINING WITH A PARTNER YOU NEVER WANT TO TRY TO THROW IT FAST STRIKES
SHE'S GOING TO TRY THAT RIGHT NOW
YOU DON'T WANT TO TRY TO GAS ON EACH FENDER WHERE ABOUT HIGH POINT IS OR WHERE PARTICULAR BODY LINE IS YOU JUST WANT TO MEASURE OUT A STRAIGHT LINE THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE WHEEL AND HE'S GOING TO RECORD THAT ON A PIECE OF PAPER FOR EACH CORNER AND SEE HOW THEY COMPARE
IF YOU NOTICE SIDE IN THE WINTERTIME DRIVE ALONG AND TRY AND USE YOUR WIPER BLADES THEY WILL TOUCH ALL OVER THE WINDSHIELD ITSELF
SO I'M JUST GOING TO I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO TRY AND GET THESE PRETTY STRAIGHT
AND WHEN YOU CAN DO THESE TRICKS WITH ANYTHING ABOUT THEM THEN SIT DOWN OF THE DINING ROOM TABLE AND TRY THEM UP AND
YOU CAN ALSO BE DIFFERENT THINGS AS FAR AS ZOOMING TRY TO QUANTIZE THINGS A CERTAIN WAY AS WELL AS TRY TO ADD IT IN A LAYER YOUR TRACKS FOR MORE BY DRAWING IN DATA OR OUR BRAIN SAMPLES WHATEVER
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN WITH THE GOLD BE HITTING BEFORE THEY BEGIN EXTENDING THEIR OWN
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS PROPERLY I DON'T SUGGEST YOU TRY THIS BECAUSE YOU COULD HURT YOURSELF
TRY TO DO ABOUT TWENTY BY TO FIFTY REPETITIONS
FAST WILL LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU TRY AND DO THAT
SO DON'T YOUR SEAT TOO HIGH FROM TRY TO RECORD REMEMBER WHAT YOUR MEASUREMENTS ARE IN CASE YOU HAVE TO MESS WITH THINGS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR SEAT NICE AND LEVEL AND GET OUT THERE AND HAVE A GOOD RIDE
SO AGAIN WHILE IT'S IMPORTANT TO OBSERVE THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF PURITY AND SELF POLLINATION VERSIONS CROSS POLLINATION JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO ISOLATE OR HAND POLLINATE YOUR CROSS-POLLINATE IN CROPS DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN TRY GROWING THEIR SEE
SO TRY TO PICK SOMETHING ON THE SHORELINE NOT THE BOOTY THAT YOU'RE SWIMMING FOR BUT A BOAT RAMP OR HOME OR LAMP HOLE OR SOMETHING SO THAT IF YOU'VE GOT A C OF BRIGHT ORANGE CAPS IN FRONT OF YOU THAT YOU STILL KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SWIMMING FOR
IT'S REAL PEARL HAS A VERY TINY BOARD BECAUSE THEY TRY TO MAINTAIN THE VALUE OF THE PEARL
THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO TRY TO PREVENT THAT ONE BIG AND DO YOUR ACRYLIC SEALANT ONCE YOUR PROJECTS DON
SQUEEZE YOUR LEGS TOGETHER SQUEEZE YOUR KNEES TOGETHER AS A YOU'RE TRYING TO SQUEEZE THE TIGHT BALL SQUEEZE TIGHTEN FOR ABOUT FIVE SECONDS RELAX AND TRY TO BEND FURTHER
NOW ONCE YOU DO THOUGH AND WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS WHEN WE RELAX THERE'S A SLIGHT BEND THE LEGS
DON'T TRY BURN YOUR TRASH ALUMINUM CANS PLASTIC RAPPERS
NOW FOR MANY PEOPLE IT'S OUR NATURAL TO TRY TO PLAY QUARTER WHILE STAND BECAUSE FOR REALLY AGE FORM PLAYERS ARE ALWAYS TAX KEEP THEIR BELL ON THE THIGH WHEN THEY'RE SITTING DOWN
AND SO NOW I WANT TO DO THE NOW THAT I'VE HOOK THESE WIRES UP I'M GOING TO TRY ALLIGATOR CLIPPING THESE WIRES FROM THOSE POINTS FROM THE BEND POINT RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT HERE
YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO TRY TO KEEP A STRAIGHT LINE FROM THE CROWN OF YOUR HEAD THROUGH YOUR SITS BONES TO COME INTO TABLE TOP AND THE INK HOW HAPPENS WHEN YOU USE BEND THE SITS BONES UP TOWARD THE CEILING DROP THE BELLY AND GENTLY RAISE THE HEART
AGAIN NOT PUTTING IT ON TOO THICK BUT NOW OUT OF KIND OF HAVE A FINE DETAILS JUST KIND OF START FILLING IN BETWEEN THEM AND JUST TRY AND GET AS MUCH COVERAGE IS I CAN WHILE NOT MISSING THE DETAIL OF ALREADY DONE
I LIKE TO TRY AND GET CRISP BY USING STARTS IN SIZE YOU WANT TO DO THAT
ALRIGHT WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PUT THESE INTO THE DEEP FRYER BECAUSE THESE BITS AND MOTHER FRYING I'M GOING TO TRY TO KEEP THEM SEPARATED
MUSCLE AND ONCE YOU'VE GOT IT IN A LATERAL DOWN YOU CAN PUT THEM BOTH TOGETHER AND YOU CAN TRY TAKING EACH SET UNILATERAL AND THEN JUST SET BILATERAL
SO WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS I LIKE TO GET ABOUT HALF WAY AND I TRY TO GET A SENSE OF WHICH WITH THIS PART IS GOING TO BREAK
THIS ONE WE TRY NOT TO DO TO REEL TOO FAST BECAUSE IT REALLY WILL TORQUE THE PERSON'S BACK IN A REALLY VERY REAL WAY
AND EVEN IF THEY DO DIE I TRY NOT TO TAKE IT PERSONALLY
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY IT YOU KNOW OFF THE ROAD HANNAH GRASS FIELD TO BEGIN WITH
YOU CAN SEE WHY I'M USING A RAZOR BLADE IS SO EASY IS POPS OF THREAD INSTEAD OF USE SOLID THAT'S THE THREAD TRY TO GET IT APART
SO THE OBJECTIVE ON THE BRAKE IS TO OF COURSE POCKET AT LEAST ONE BALL WHICH IS THEN GOING TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY AT THE TABLE AND THEN TRY TO POCKET MORE BALLS
USE PRODUCTS FORMULATED FOR OILY OR COMBINATION SKIN AND TRY TO AVOID TOUCHING YOUR FACE TOO OFTEN
YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THE ONE'S GOING FROM THE GROUND IS A SPORT BOEHM ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE EYES YOU DON'T WANT TO TRY AND CROSS HATCH SO ON AND PUT SOME OTHERS RUN IN THE OPPOSITE WAY AND THIS WILL GIVE YOUR SHELTER SOME MORE SUPPORT FOR LAY IN THE COVER ON IT TO WHERE IT'S SUPPORTS IT BETTER AND IT'S A MUCH STRONGER STURDIER SHELTER
SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE WAYS THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY A TRYING TO TO USE TO TRY TO OF REDUCE THIS THE SEVERITY ALL THE INTENSITY OF THE ALL THAT CREEPY QUALITY SENSATION THAT YOU'VE YOU'VE ENCOUNTER WHEN YOU GET A RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME
LET'S TRY SLOWLY AGAIN WEIGHT SHIFT ONE
DID YOU EVER TRY TO LIKE FIND SOME CD THAT SEVEN ELEVEN
I DON'T WANT TO SEE PEOPLE COME UP LIKE THIS AND TRY TO KARATE CHOP THEM RIGHT ON THE ON THE COLLARBONE
DON'T TRY TO CUT THIS HAIR AFTER FEELING THEM UP WITH SWEETS
THE OKINAWANS THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE VERY SIMPLE MINDED THEY LIFTING THE BEACH KIND OF A BEACH KIND OF TO RAIN AND SO THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE ABLE TO THEY DON'T WANT TO TRY TO ATTEMPT THAT KIND OF STUFF BECAUSE IT'S DANGEROUS FOR YOUR FOOTWORK YOU MIGHT SLIP
SO WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR GARDEN YOUR MAN YOU GO ON HELP SIDE AGAIN YOU NEED TO STAY LOW DROP STEP AND KEEP THOSE GOOD WIDE STANCE IS UP OR SPRINT TO A PARTICULAR POINT TO TRY TO GET OVER AND STOP THIS GUY
NOW AS HE'S COMING ON THE DRIVE WITH THIS GUY NEEDS TO DO SO MANY TIMES WE SEE OUR DEFENDERS COME IN AND THEY'LL GET HERE IS THIS GUY'S DRIVE BY THEY WANT TO OPEN UP AND TRY TO SWAT AND FROM BEHIND
IF WE MOVE TO THE NEXT MEASURE WE HAVE IN HALF AND WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE BASS CLEF AND THE BASS CLEF HAS THE DOT ABOVE AND BELOW THE STAFF LINE SO THAT'S A DEAD GIVE AWAY THAT THAT'S OUT IF YOU WANT TO TRY YOUR GOOD BOYS DO FINALIZE THAT WILL ALSO BRING IT TO HAVE ANYWAY HERE'S A HALF THE VERY NEXT NOTE IS IN HALF WITH A SHARP SYMBOL IN FRONT
SO MAKE SURE YOU GET A KIND OF HAVE A BOWL THEN IT LIKE THIS TO TRY AND KEEP THEM FROM TURNING IT
USUALLY THAT HAS SOME SORT OF SCRUB IN IT AND THAT JUST CLEANS OUT THOSE PORES TO TRY TO GET THEM TO SHRINK DOWN GET THE OIL AND DIRT OUT
AND SO IF YOU CAN FIND A CHALLENGING TRAIL AND ACTUALLY TIME YOURSELF ON IT AND DO REPEATS ON THE TRAIL AND TRY TO CLEAN UP YOUR TURNING CLEAN UP YOUR SHIFTING YOUR WEIGHT WHERE YOU SHIFT ON THE SHIFT YEARS AGO THOSE THINGS
GOT INTO YOUR BACKYARD AND GIVE IT A TRY
TRY AGAIN
AND THE LITTLE BABY FISH WILL SWIMMING IN SWIMMING AS HARD AS IT COULD TO TRY TO GET BACK TO POP UP BUT IT JUST GET GETTING FURTHER AND FURTHER AND FURTHER
YOU CAN ALSO TRY A MORE CHALLENGING POSITION WITH THE LEGS EXTENDED AND JUST BRINGING YOUR ARMS OVERHEAD OR WHAT SEAMS OVERHEAD IN THIS POSITION AND THEN DOWN
IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE HORN ALIGNMENT ISSUE THEN TRY SINGLE AND ARMS INSIDE OF THE DOUBLE ARMS TO THE TWO ARMS AT THE SAME TIME
SO LET'S SAY I WERE TO NOT STAYING ON THE GAS THAT WILL ACTUALLY KILL THE DRIFTING MUSIC OF FOUR WHEEL DRIVE CAR SO LET'S TRY AND DEMONSTRATE THAT
WELL LIKE YOU TO DO IS TRY TO STAND WITH YOUR FEET PARALLEL
I'M GOING TO TRY TO BE A VERY EXPLOSIVE WITH IT ALRIGHT
YOU HAVE ALL YOUR THINGS TOGETHER I WOULD PROBABLY SUGGEST TO GO AHEAD AND AND GET EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND ALSO TRY TO HAVE NO DISTRACTIONS A POSSIBLE
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER AND A LOT OF TIMES I AS I START FORMING THE CLAY ON THE ON THE ARM AND TRY TO KEEP TAKING IT AWAY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO SHAPE UNTIL YOU GET THE SHAPE THAT YOU WANT
TRY TO REDUCE THE LEMON IT WILL ADD IT TO OUR SHRIMP
AND THEN KIND OF SEE THAT I WANT TO TRY TO GET THAT GO HERE AND CLEAR AND DO HERE IS BEST I CAN DO TO GET THAT MEASUREMENT
THE SECOND THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TRY TO USE MOTIVATION TO TEACH THAT DOG TO SWIM
TRY TO LINE THEM UP A LITTLE BIT BUT REALLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR A PLACE THAT'S A SMOOTH SURFACE TO GLUE THEM ONTO
ONE DROP OF SOAP REPRESENTING A DOLLAR BILL AND WE TRY TO EVEN THOSE OUT JUST TO GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF SUDS REPRESENTING CLEANING POWER WE'LL GO AHEAD AND TO WIGGLE THIRTY DOLLARS VERSES TEN DOLLARS
SO I'M GOING TO COME IN AND OUT AND MAKE SURE THAT I SCOOP OUT SOME CHICKEN AND SOME TREE SO AS WELL AS CARROTS AND TOMATOES AND I'M GOING TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF ALL ON TOP SO WE CAN SEE SOME TREE SO SOME ORANGE FROM THE CARROTS SOME WHITE FROM THE CHICKEN AND THEN I'LL COME BACK WITH OUR JUICE AND POUR THAT OVER THE TOP IT OFF AND SO HERE WE HAVE OUR CORN OIL AND RED BEAN RICE WITH OUR CHICKEN AND SAUSAGE RAGU
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE PLAYING I'M NOT TRY TO COME TO THE TIMING SCORE AND WARM UP THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE AT LEAST FIFTEEN MINUTES SO YOU HAVE GOOD TEN MINUTES TO WARM UP YOUR BODY BEFORE YOU START WITH THE MAT
SO WHEN YOU'RE FEELING STRONG YOU'VE DONE LOTS AND LOTS OF CHOWDER ON THAT IS YOU'VE DONE LOTS AND LOTS OF ONE LEGGED PLANK POSE IS DONE LOTS AND LOTS OF DOLPHINS AND YOU'RE FEELING THE INVERSIONS YOU'RE FEELING THE FOREARMS STANCE TRY THIS ONE
WE'RE GOING TO TRY FIRST TO PULLED OR EXISTING DOCTOR WORK
WE'RE GOING TO TRY THAT FIRST IF WE CAN SUPPLEMENT THERE ARE SOME GREAT NEW SYSTEMS THAT THAT WE CAN GET INTO IF WE IF WE CROSS THAT THAT BRIDGE
BUT WE'RE GOING TO FIRST TRY IS THE EXISTING GOT FOUR AND SEE IF THAT DOESN'T THIS JOB
JUST TRY TO BUST MANUAL GO A LITTLE FASTER JUST BE READY
TRY A FEW REPETITIONS
I WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE BALL IN THE CORNER POCKET WHICH I WOULD MAKE A AND THEN I WOULD HAVE MYSELF IN A POSITION YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TRY TO PLAY POSITION IT'S ANOTHER VIDEO TAPE FOLKS GOOD I PUT MYSELF IN SUCH A POSITION THAT I COULD PLAY THE OF THE TIME BALL IN THIS CORNER AND MAKE MY CUE BALL COME OUT FOR A GOOD POSITIONING SHOT FOR THE EIGHT BALL AND WINNING THE GAME
MY TRICK IS THEY CAN HANDLE TOO MUCH SHADE EITHER SO IF YOU HAVE AN AREA WHERE WEEDS WON'T GROW IN THERE'S ONLY MONSTER PINE NEEDLES DON'T EVEN TRY TO DRAW STRING
STRAW SPLASH SCOUTS CLAW SPROTT AND HAVE THEM JUST SAY THOSE AND TRY NOT TO PUT THE VOWEL ON THE AND LIKE I DID
OFTEN TIMES CUSTOMERS CALL ME AND WE'LL TRY TO TALK TO ME FOR AN HOUR OF WHY THEY THINK EVERY DOG SHOULD BE TAKEN TO A DOG PARK
I'M GOING TO GIVE IT A TRY BY HAND FIRST
SO YOU KNOW WHETHER YOUR CAST AND YOU JUST WANT TO PULL YOUR LINE BACK IN AFTER YOU SHOT IT OUT TO MAKE THE NEXT CAST OR WHETHER YOU'VE ACTUALLY HOOK THE FISH AND YOU WANT TO TRY TO RETRIEVE THAT LINE AS QUICK AS YOU CAN THIS IS THIS IS WHAT WE CALL STRIPPING LINE RIGHT HERE
SO TECHNICALLY SPEAKING WHEN YOU LAND OR YOU TRY TO RIDE UP WHEN IT'S GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO DO SO IN A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT PATTERN
YOU COULD TRY TO FIND OUT ON A SMALL IRON AT HOME TO TRY THIS BUT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO STEAM IRON THAT HAVE HOLES IN THE SURFACE AND YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO TEFLON COATED IRON
NOW THE NEXT THING HE WANTS TO DO IS HE'S GOING TO TRY TO TELL THIS GUY WHERE IS GOING
THEN WE ADD THE SECOND BALL AND TRY THE SAME THING
NORMALLY THE THE TIME KEEPER AT RING SIDE IS GOING TO BE KEEPING TRACK OF THE THE TWO MINUTE ROUNDS IN THE MINUTE REST PUT IT IN BETWEEN IF YOU HAVE THE HEADS UP YOURSELF ON APPROXIMATELY WHEN TEN SECONDS IS LEFT IN THE AROUND YOU CAN TRY TO GET YOUR BOXER A LITTLE BIT MORE EXCITED AND A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT MORE ABLE TO FINISH THAT ROUND IN A GOOD POSITIVE WAY
AFTER THAT THEN YOU CAN TRY TO GET YOURSELF SET UP TO WHERE YOU CAN GET SOME NBA SCOUTS LOOKING AT YOU POSSIBLY GO GO TO THE PROS
POSSIBLY IF YOU POSSIBLY CAN AVERAGE OVER TO TRY TO AVERAGE DOUBLE DIGITS
THAT JOB IS TO GO AS HARD AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN THROUGH THIS GAP AND TO TRY TO GET TO THAT QUARTERBACK AND MAKE A STOP IN THE BACKFIELD
THAT MEANS IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR LINEBACKERS AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO IS PUT THEM ON ALL OUT RUN THROUGH THE LINE TO TRY TO GET TO EITHER STOP THE PLAY IN THE BACKFIELD WITH THE RUNNING BACK OR TO TRY TO GET TO A QUARTERBACK
FIRST THING TRY A TEXTURE RISING SHAMPOO OR SOME TYPE OF VOLUME RISING OR CURL ENHANCING SHAMPOOED TO HELP PUMP UP YOUR CURL
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A FEW TIPS AND I WANT YOU TO TRY THEM WHEN YOU GET HOME
BRIAN GO AHEAD AND TRY IT OUT
TRY TO PUSH YOUR KNEES OUT TO THE FRESH
I'M GOING TO TRY AND AVOID AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE GETTING THAT EXPERIENCE CRAP INTO THE CLAY SO I HAVE LESS TO CLEAN OUT BUT IT'S KIND OF INEVITABLE AND THEN AFTER I DID SOME OF THIS OUT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO CLEAN OUT THAT EXTRANEOUS MATERIAL AND PREPARE IT FOR TESTING AND USE YOUR CERAMIC WORK
LET'S TRY THAT ONE MORE TIME
THAT KIND OF INFORMATION THAT CRIMINALS TRY TO GET INCLUDE USER NAMES PASSWORDS CREDIT CARD BACK COUNT OR SO SECURITY NUMBERS
BAGS OR WHAT GO INSIDE THE WHEEL AND SIT AND ACTUALLY WE TRY TO KEEP YOUR BOARD SPINNING
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF ETIQUETTE NOT ONLY WILL YOU HELP SPEED UP PLAY BUT YOU ALSO BE DOING YOUR PARTNER FAVOR BY HELPING AND TRY TO LOCATE IS BALL
I'M AND THEN USUALLY YOU KNOW TRY AND SEE HOW HIGH YOU CAN GO
TRY AND USED EARLIER ON AN ARM WORKS ARE NOT TOO
NOW I DON'T HAVE MANY OF YOU'VE GONE OUT TRY TO PUT ON A GOLF TOURNAMENT BUT UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT DO THIS HAVE NEVER PLAYED GOLF
IF YOU'RE HAVING A HARD TIME I'M COMPLETING ONE OF YOUR TUMBLING PASS IS CORRECTLY REALLY GO BACK AND TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHERE YOUR HEAD IS GOING IN YOUR PASS AND YOU CAN WORK ON THAT IN YOUR MIND AND AND AND REALLY TRY IT AGAIN WITH THE PROPER HEAD POSITION
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WHEN WE EAT WE ENJOY THE FOOD WE TRY TO CREATE A RESTFUL ENVIRONMENT IN THAT WE DON'T HAVE GUILT OVER THE FUSE GUILTY PLEASURES THAT WE HAVE LIKE A SMALL PIECE OF CHOCOLATE OR A COOKIE
GARY IS A PRETTY GOOD SERVER TURNED ON THE WALL SO I'M GOING TO TRY TO WASH BOX IN HERE AND HIT A LOB SERVE
THEY CAN OBVIOUS BLOOD AND TRY AND NOT SHOOT THE GUYS THAT ARE ON OUR TEAM THE ARBITER AND COMPANY
OKAY SO THAT WAS IN THAT GREAT I DIDN'T GET AS FAR AS I WOULD LIKE TO SO I'M GOING TO TRY THAT AGAIN
THERE'S THE OIL BASED PASTEL WHICH IS A LOT OF FUN IN IT BLENDS EITHER WITH CURE TIPS ARE ACTUALLY I'VE TRIED IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF A PAIN REMEMBER LACQUER THINNER AND IT'S AN INTERESTING PROCESS BUT I THINK IS TO KEEP IT SMELLS DOWN AND JUST HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN JUST TRY BLENDING IT FIRST WITH THE PROFESSIONAL CUE TIP UP OR THE NOTES THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER AND I'LL EXPLAIN TO THOSE TWO IN JUST A MINUTE
I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SUPPLIES THAT THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO HALF OR WANT TO AT LEAST HAVE TO TRY AND TIME START DRAWING IN PASTEL
THE NEXT THING I WANT TO DO IT DON'T TRY TO ADD SOME TYPE OF SYMBOLS HOME DO IS GO TO MY NEXT AVAILABLE TRACK DOWN AND ADD SOME MORE RIGHT HERE AND HIT ON ONE RECORD IT OUT OF CLAY IS
WHAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT NOW IS WHEN OUR DEFENSIVE TACKLES IN PURSUIT OF A TACKLE THE FIRST THING HE'S GOT TO DO IS HE'S GOT TO COME UP AND HE'S GOT TO TRY TO CONTROL THIS OFFENSIVE LINEMEN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
SO I'VE MADE A LOT OF THESE AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY
AND FROM THERE I'M GOING TO START WITH JUST A LITTLE BIT AND I'M GOING TO START USING MY MIXER AND SLOWLY TRY TO GET THIS STARTING TO GET MIXED
DON'T USE THESE FOR FOOD PREPARATION AS WELL YOU WANT TO TRY TO PREVENT ANY CONTAMINATION FROM YOUR FOOD GETTING INTO YOUR SKIN CARE PRODUCTS AND THE OTHER WAY AROUND ALSO
THE SIMPLE YOU KEEP IT THE MORE CLASS THAT YOU WILL LOOK BUT OF COURSE YOU CAN ALWAYS TRY AND HAVE DIFFERENT PIECES LIKE FASHIONABLE TYPE OF PIECES WITH DRESSES
ALSO MAYBE TRY BRAIDING YOUR HAIR AT NIGHT
AS FAR AS I TRY TO FIND BUSES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
NOW THE QUARTERBACK PIN IS GOING TO TURN AND RUN TO THIS SIDE OF THE FIELD AND HE'S GOING TO TRY TO LOOK TO HELP OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLAY
SO THE QUARTERBACK'S JOBS JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ON THE REVERSE WHERE HE'S GOING TO GO AHEAD AND FAKE TO PLAY CARRY OUT THE HAND OFF OF THE PLAY AND THEN HE'S GOING TO TRY TO GET IN THE ACTION OF THE PLAY AND GET A CHANCE TO THROW BLOCK
WE THEN WANT TO TRY TO PUT THE WHOLE TOSS THE BALL IS TO TAKE IT BACK
SO WE CAN TRY TO REMEMBER THAT A LITTLE BIT I
I'M GOING TO TRY AND GET RID OF THAT THAT SHADOW IN ANOTHER WAY
BUT IF YOU JUST TRY TO STOP AND POWDER YOU'RE JUST GOING TO PROBABLY HIT A TREE BECAUSE THAT HAPPENS A LOT TREES OR AROUND
SO I'M GOING TO TRY MY SAND WEDGE SO HERE I'M NOT TRYING TO SPIN IT OR PUT IT ON THE GREEN I'M JUST TRYING TO ADVANCE THE BALL TOWARD THE GREEN OR TO GET IT TO THE GREEN WITH A FULL CLUB
ALL I WANT TO DO IS COME STRAIGHT UP IS CENTERLINE I DON'T WANT TO TRY TO RAISE MY ARMS UP WHATEVER WORK
I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT YOU BUY ROCK CLIMBING SHOES ONLINE SIMPLY FOR THE FACT THAT YOU CAN TRY THEM ON
ALRIGHT SO THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE I WANT YOU TO GO AHEAD AND TRY TO PLAY WITH ME
THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT YOU SHOULD DO IS JUST LOOK ON AND NECK GET SOME CARDS MADE AND TRY TO MAKE SOME CONNECTIONS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING EVENTS
THEY CAN ALSO WORK WITH ALCOHOL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THEIR OWN STATES TO WHERE THEY ACTUALLY ARE TRAINED TOGETHER IN A DO THINGS LIKE ALCOHOL PURCHASER VICE TO WHERE THEY'LL GO IN AND ACTUALLY GO TO THE STORE AND TRY AND PURCHASE ALCOHOL AND THEN WE TRACK BECAUSE IT'S AN BUT THERE'S A NICE YOU
SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS WE DO SHOULDER TAPS TO WEAR WILL GO IN AND TRYING THEM TO WHERE THEY'LL GO UP TO THE PEOPLE IN THE PARKING LOT OF MAYBE A GROCERY STORE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND TRY TO GET THEM TO PURCHASE ALCOHOL AS WELL
IT TRY THE HEELS ARE PROBABLY FOR TAKES OFF
WHICH ONE USE BUT JUST SINCE THE NAME IS COST NOLLIE MARGARITA OBVIOUSLY GOING TO TRY TO USE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE AUTHENTIC
THE ONLY REAL RISK THAT THERE ISN'T WORKING WITH A CIRCUIT BOARDS FROM ELECTRONICS POINT OF VIEW IS YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT MAKE A BENDER TRY SOMETHING OUT THAT MIGHT FRY SOMETHING IN THE CIRCUIT BOARD LIKE YOU MIGHT FREYA CAPACITOR OR YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU KNOW IF YOU SEND LIKE A LOT OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE BOARD YOU KNOW TOO CLOSE TO THE POWER SOURCE OR TOO CLOSE TO YOUR CAPACITORS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
JUST GET OUT THERE AND TRY IT
SO LET'S TRY SOME POINT WITH YOU GUYS
LET'S TRY A LITTLE FASTER
BUT THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF PREP WORK YOU WANT TO DO BEFORE YOU TRY TO SHOW YOUR WORK OUT IN PUBLIC
THIS IS HANGING TRY AND BEGINNING XING YI
YOU WANT TO SURROUND YOURSELF WITH FRIENDS WHO ARE SUPPORT OVEN EMOTIONALLY A THE OR FOR YOU AND PERHAPS IN THE BEGINNING YEAR TO GO AND TRY TO START DATING AGAIN SO ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO DO IS TRY TO GO OUT GROUPS AND GROUP ACTIVITIES
SO ONCE I'VE GOT MY INK ALL OVER IT I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PUT IT IN MY TRY AND I'M GOING TO POUR JUST A LITTLE BIT OF MY EMBOSSING POWDER ALL OVER IT AGAIN BY LITTLE BIT I MEAN COVER IT
NOW TRY PUTTING YOUR ARMS OUT OKAY
SO I'M GOING TO COME OVER UNDER MY KNEES AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO SPREAD MY TOES AS WIDE AS I CAN AND JUST SIT BACK ON MY HEELS ADDING A LITTLE PRESSURE
SO I'M GOING TO TRY TO CUT THE THREE IN THE PIECES THAT ARE NUMBERED THREE IN SIXTY TO RECTANGLES OUT OF THE SAME PIECE
I'M GOING TO TRY TO SAVE AS MUCH GLASSES I CAN SO I'M GOING TO MAKE ONE LINE
IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS DOING IT ON ONE NAIL YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY TO NAILS OR YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY WHAT WE CALL THE CLAW USE ALL OF YOUR FINGERNAILS SO ALL OF YOUR NAILS ARE IN CONTACT WITH THE BOTTOM OF THE FRISBEE
I MEAN ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN REALLY THINK OF ORDER THAT YOU EXPERIENCE EVERYDAY JUST TRY IT CAUSE THE NEVER HURTS TO JUST COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT'S OUT OF YOUR MIND OR WHATEVER
I'M GOING TO TRY AND PLACE MY KNEES ON THE OUTSIDE OF MY SHOULDERS
IT'S SO THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY TO THEY OUT HERE I'M GOING TO GIVE A TWENTY MINUTES
LET'S TRY WAVE
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN
SHE'S GOING TO TRY TO KEEP THIS LEG ACTIVE BUT SHE'S GOING TO USE THIS WILL STRAP TO SISTER AND SHE'S GOING TO USE AN INHALE TO LET THE BODY AND THEN ON THE EXHALE SHE'S GOING TO BRING THAT LEG OVER TO THE RIGHT
LOOK AT THE FUR THIS POINT YOU CAN POSSIBLY C AND TRY AND GET THAT BALANCE AS CLEAN AS YOU CAN
THIS IS AN ACTIVITY THIS POTENTIALLY FEAR INDUCING FOR YOUR DOG SO YOU WANT TO WORK SLOWLY AND TRY NOT TO HAVE ANY ACCIDENTS WHERE YOUR DOG ACTUALLY IS THROWN FROM THE TREADMILL WHICH WOULD MAKE YOUR DOG MUCH MORE WHERRY ABOUT PUTTING FOOT ON IT AGAIN
TRY WORKING UP TO ABOUT TEN REPS WITH RIGHT FOOT OVER LEFT AND THEN STRETCH IN BETWEEN IF YOU NEED TO AND CROSS LEFT OVER RIGHT AND CURL CRUNCH BREATH INHALE DOWN
TRY TO STAY IN EITHER MULTIPLES OF THREE OR TOO BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE PATTERN WORKS AS WE EXPAND ON OUR CIRCLE
OKAY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT DON'T TRY TO LEAN FORWARD OR STRUGGLE
WHICH IS WHAT THE MOST FAMOUS JUGGLING TRICKS AND ONE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE TRY TO LEARN EARLY
IF YOU DON'T FIND ONE JUST TRY TO LINE UP THE SEAMS AND SEE IF YOU CAN GET THE SEAMS LINED UP
MY PARTNER IS HERE MY FRIENDS HERE IT'S STUDIO WANTS ME TO DO SOME KIND OF SPACESHIP AND PASTEL SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO IS MORE SPACE IT SLASH PLAIN HERE
THERE ARE A GOOD TRICK IS AT THE CONCEALER REALLY COVERS UP IS TO IF YOU ARE IN THE STORE AND YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO TEST YOUR PRODUCT IS TO CHECK ON THE BACK OF YOUR HAND AND TRY TO COVER UP ON YOU KNOW ANY BLUE VEINS THAT YOU SEE THEY'RE USUALLY A LITTLE MORE VISIBLE ON ON FAIR SKIN PEOPLE
IT'S GOOD TO USE IN BEING TO REPLACE A OBVIOUSLY BUT DON'T TRY TO MAKE A SCRAMBLE LEGS AT WHAT WEAR
AGAIN IF YOU CHOOSE TO TRY TO DO THESE ON AND MAKE SOME OUT FRONT KICK SIDE KICK I'M SORT OF BACKSWING RIGHT HERE YOU CAN DO THAT YOU LIKE TO MIX IT UP LIKE THAT
SO TRY IT
SO HE PLAYS A LITTLE LIKE THIS SOMETIMES NOT I KICK PLATE ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT I'LL TRY
I'VE ALSO HAVE MY CLIENTS TELL ME THAT THE EXPERIENCE SOMETHING SIMILAR WHERE BY KEEPING SO FOCUSED ON THEIR EYE ON THEIR RACING MAYBE NOT EVEN THE RACE YOU COULD BE EVEN WHEN YOU'RE DOING LIKE TRAINING OR SPEAK WITH TRY OR THEY'RE A COIN OUT FOR A LONG TRAINING YOU RUN AND EXPERIENCE A A RUNNER IS KIND OF A HIGH
JUST GO AND TRY IT AND MESS AROUND AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AND YOU PROBABLY COME UP WITH SOMETHING COOL OF YOUR UP
NOW THE MORE YOU TRY THIS THE MORE BETTER PREPARE YOU'LL BE WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF YOUR NOSE BLUNT SLIDE
WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TRY TO TURN AROUND I THROW IT IN WITH OUR SAUCE
IT WILL TRY TO GIVE YOU THE LARGEST APERTURE SETTING IN ORDER TO MAKE THE BACKGROUND BLUR OUT A LOT AND WILL HELP TO MAKE YOUR YOUR SUBJECT OR YOUR YOUR PORTRAIT INDIVIDUAL STAND OUT FOR THE BACKGROUND
I'M GOING TO MIX IT AROUND TRY TO MAKE SURE I GET ALL THOSE NUMBERS DON'T LEAVE ANYTHING IT ALL TO START ANOTHER FIRE WITHOUT ME KNOWING ABOUT IT
FIRST THING THAT YOU SHOULD TRY AND DO IS SWIMMERS AGGRESSIVELY IS YOU CAN AROUND THE STRING UP TO AVOID IT FIRST AND FOREMOST
NOW LET'S TRY A LITTLE FASTER
SO THESE GET DIRTY TRY TO BRUSH THEM OFF OF THE DRY CLOTH
FOR THIS OLD CAR WE'RE JUST GOING TO PUT THE BATTERY AND TRY TO GET TO OUR NEXT DESTINATION
AND YOU JUST WANT TO LOOK DON'T TRY TO CATCH THEM WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ALL CATCH A BOWL
JUST YOU KNOW TRY TO GET HIM TO FALL IN AN AREA WHERE YOU CAN SEE THEM FALLING IN YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU ARE TRYING TO CATCH THEM IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO CATCH THEM
WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY TO DO IS THROW ALL FIVE OF THEM UP IN THE AIR NICE AND THEY'RE ALL GOING ACROSS
WHATEVER IT IS TRY TO USE MOTIVATION
YOU CAN ALSO TRY WASTE WEIGHT THEY COME IN ONE POUND WEIGHT SO YOU CAN RIP WRAP THEM AROUND YOUR HAND AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HOLDING ANYTHING AS YOU'RE LIFTING
WE CAN USE THIS TO MOLD WITH IT IS VERY TEMPERATURE SENSITIVE SO YOU HAVE TO TRY NOT TO HANDLE IT TOO MUCH AND YOU MAY HAVE TO PUT IT BACK INTO THE REFRIGERATOR FROM TIME TO TIME AS YOU'RE WORKING WITH IT IF YOU FIND THAT IT BECOMES TOO SOFT
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN WHERE TO PLACE YOUR FEET ON THE BOARD YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN THE PROPER SPEED AND YOU NEED TO A NICE FLAT SMOOTH SURFACE TO TRY IT ON
SO TRY ONE MORE TIME THEN WE'LL TAKE IT FROM THE TOP
SET FOR A LITTLE BIT MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT THE BALANCE AND SEW THEM BACK UP GIVING THE JO AND TRY TO GET
ON YOUR WHEN YOU WORK WITH PLACEMENT I ALWAYS TRY TO WORK WITH EACH CHAIR HAVING A PLACE TO PUT A COUPLE COFFEE
ONCE AGAIN LIKE I SAID EARLIER IF YOU WANT TO TRY TO ARRANGE IT WHERE IT LOCKS THE HEAT AND SO THEY'RE THING IGNITES REAL WELL
I TRY TO SAY HEY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THIS OR IF YOU KNOW BUT YOU COULD PLAY WILCHER BASKETBALL AND THEY LOOK AT ME LIKE IF I CAN GET HIM TO COME OUT GET HIM TO TRY AND GIVE IT A WATCH OUR TEAM AND GET THEM TO REALIZE WE TRAVEL AND WE HAVE FUN AND MORE SEMI PROFESSIONAL SOMETIMES IT GETS IN THEIR BLOOD IN THEIR HOOK FOR LIFE BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE RIGHT OUT THERE RIGHT NOW WE CAN PLAY THIS GAME AND THEY JUST DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I THINK THEY CAN BUT THEY I GIVE IT A SHOT
REMEMBER TO TRY THIS AS OFTEN AS YOU CAN TO GET REALLY GOOD HAND
IF YOU WANT TO JUST GAME MUSCLE AND IT'S NOT BOTH UP BUT JUST A MUSCLE YOU TRY TO DO ABOUT THREE THIRTY MINUTES SESSIONS OR THREE DAYS A WEEK SO A COUPLE THINGS TO THINK ABOUT
UPRIGHT BASS THE TRAIN IS STILL NECESSARY BECAUSE YOU STILL NEED TO KEEP THE HEART RATE UP AND UPRIGHT BASS THE SYSTEM IN GOOD SHAPE SO TRY THAT ABOUT ONE DAY A WEEK MAYBE TWO DAYS A WEEK
IF YOUR GOAL IS TO GET LEAN IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORY TRY TO DO FIVE TO SIX DAYS A WEEK ABOUT THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES SESSIONS AND YOU WANT TO TRY TO PUSH YOURSELF BETWEEN THE SEVENTY FIVE AND EIGHTY PERCENTILE OF YOUR MAXIMUM HEART RATE SO GOOD THING TO DO IS CHECK THE HEART RATE MONITORS THAT ARE ON THE EQUIPMENT THAT YOU'RE HAVING YOUR LOCAL GYM
SO THE PROCESS WAS I START AT THE DEFENSE AND HEAD AND BOX BLADE ON THE BACK OF MY TRACTOR AND PULL THAT AND TRY TO SMOOTH OUT AS MUCH AS I COULD BE AND I JUST TRY TO FOLLOW THE CONTOUR THE LAND
START OUT SLOW IN THE WILL INCREASE THE SPEED WITH A LOT OF WORK WAS WITH YOUR BEST AND THAT IS HE'S GOING TO MOVE AROUND ACTUALLY THIS CASE I'M GOING TO MOVE AROUND AND HE'S GOING TO FOLLOW ME AROUND AND TRY AND MAINTAIN THIS POSITION
IT'S KEY TO TRY THIS TO TRY IT A COUPLE TIMES WITH A FRIEND AROUND SO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE
LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN
I'M JUST GOING TO TRY ON MY MACHINE AND I HAVE FIRED UP MY IRON BECAUSE I'M GOING TO USE IN A MINUTE
UNTIED SORT OF IN AN INVITATION OF HOW AMERICAN SPOT THAT MAYBE TRY THEM IN AFRICA WOULD WEAR IT
AND I CAN'T CAN TRY TO TALK PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN OFF
NOW WHAT I DO IS GO AHEAD AND WORK YOUR WAY OCCUR US AND I USUALLY GO AHEAD AND LEAN THOSE GAPS IN BETWEEN BECAUSE THEN WHEN I GET AND NOW I TURN AROUND AND GO BACK OVER THE SPOTS THAT ARE LEFT OPEN SO IT MAKES FOR A CONSTANT LYING IT THAT WAY YOU'RE NOT PULLING OUT YOUR OTHER STITCHES IT WEARS IF YOU TRY TO DO IT ONE TIME THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
MAYBE YOU WANT TO TRY TO FIND LINES THAT ARE SMALLER
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS IF YOU TRY TO RUN A DESCENT COUPLE WOOFERS THAT YOU'LL BE RUNNING WITH THESE ON FIRE OR DUMP ARE STILL BE A BIG DIFFERENCE ON BOTTOM WISE SOME WISE QUALITY WISE ON DISTORTION WISE
AND THE WASH THEM IN OUR COLD WATER NOW YOU WANT TO TRY THEM IN THE SAME SETTINGS AS YOUR WHITE CLOTHES
MOST KIDS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO TEAR THE MASK AND MAKES FOR A FAIRLY UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE ALL THE WAY AROUND
THE LAST THING I WANT TO TRY AND DO IS I STILL WANT TO CREATE SOME MORE SEPARATION AND THAT ONE DARK AREA BEHIND THE NECK IS A LITTLE FRUSTRATING TO BE
SO TRY THAT A FEW TIMES AND PUT IT IN YOUR DANCE
AND JUST HAVE TO TRY A LITTLE BIT OF THIS DIPPING SAUCE
SO THANK YOU FOR WATCHING ME I AM AND TRY TO USE RECIPES OUT
YOU'RE REALLY ENJOY THEM AND MAYBE YOU WANT TO ONE ONE TO DIG INTO YOUR NICE FAKE AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY THIS FOR A CHANGE
SO I CAN USE A GOOD AMOUNT FOR MY EIGHT TO TEN OUNCES BUT I WANT TO TRY IT STRONGER
SO TRY TO WORK ON THOSE EASY DAYS ON A SMOOTH PEDAL STROKE SITTING REAL SQUARE IN THE SADDLE PEDDLING NICE CIRCLES
SOME OF THOSE ONES THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO GET OFF YOU MIGHT EVEN TRY TO GO INTO A CAR WASH AND USING A HIGH PRESSURE GOING ON
NOW YOU SHOULD TRY FAKIE OLLIE UNTIL YOU'VE GOT CLEAN OLLIES ROLLING FORWARD AND ONCE YOU'VE GOT THOSE DOWN AND YOU'RE ABLE TO POP THEM NICE AND CLEANLY AND DO THEM ROLLING PRETTY FAST
MOST IMPORTANT NEVER TRY TO WORK IF YOU'RE TIRED NEVER OF TRY TO TURN IF YOU'VE CONSUMED ALCOHOL OR TAKE MANY DRUGS
JUST KEEP A SHORT DISTANCE BETWEEN EACH OTHER MAYBE TO MEET THEIR SORCERY I THINK IT'S MORE IT'S THE LONG AND TRY TO GO IN THE SAME WAY AS THE OTHER PERSON WAS YOU FRONTAL WHO'S GOING SO IF THE OTHER PERSON WAS YOU WANT TO IF YOU IS GOING TO A B C D CHORD HE'S OR OR BY THUMB AND SLIDING BY FEET'S FOR SUMMER TO HOLD IT AS THE WITH THEIR TO STAND
NOW I GRAB THE PICTURE UP HERE SO YOU'RE JUST SING THE TOP PART LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN
AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO THAT FOR IF YOU HAVE A TIMER TRY THAT FOR THIRTY SECONDS AND THEN AFTER YOU GET THAT FOR THIRTY SECONDS AT SOMEONE TIME YOU AND YOU DO THE EXACT SAME THING JUST THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION GOING THIS WAY
SO LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN BOTTOM TO THE STOMACH THERE YOU GO OUT UNDERNEATH AND THEN USE SKATE AND THAT'S THAT IN THE SKATE FROM A BEAR HUG
REMEMBER TO GET RID OF WHITEHEADS USE HOT COMPRESSES EXFOLIATE YOUR SKIN WITH AN OATMEAL TREATMENT AND TRY IT OVER THE COUNTER BEND SOIL PEROXIDE
TRY TO KEEP YOUR HANDS AND HAIR AWAY FROM YOUR FACE
AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS JUST TRY TO BRING MY HEELS HIGH AS YOU CAN
SO WE'RE GOING TO WORK A LITTLE BIT WITH THIS MY CUFF WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY TO HAVE ALL THE TIME IT'S MY COUGH MOVING UP AND DOWN YOUR BRING IN ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND HOW YOU AS YOU CAN
SO IF YOUR BIG CAPTAIN COKE FAN USUALLY WHAT YOUR WRIST AND AS THE BALL ARE WHAT YOU SIMPLY HOME I WANT TO TRY OUT THE CAPTAIN PEPPERS FOR A LITTLE BIT OF SOMETHING DIFFERENT
SO YOU WANT TO TRY TO FIND YOUR HIP BONES POINT BOTH YOUR HEADLIGHTS FORWARD
SO YOU SHOULD CHECK YOUR CAMERA MANUAL AND TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHY THAT'S NOT WORKING AND ALL THAT PROBLEM
MY NAME IS JAMES WITH THE RESURGENCE GROUP WE SPECIALIZE IN AUTO INSURANCE AND THE ONE THING THAT WE REALLY TRY AND STRESS IS THAT IT'S NICE TO HAVE AN AGENT THAT YOU CAN GO IN AND SEE AND SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS WITH THEM ALL OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS OVER THE YEARS THAT CHANGE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE PROPER INSURANCE ON ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU NEED IT AND THAT'S WHEN THEY HAVE THAT LAST AND YOU HAVE AN ACCIDENT AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU PROPERLY COVERED
ONE THING YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS TRY NOT TO LEAVE THE MOVEMENT WITH THE HEAD BUT KEEP THE HEAD IN LINE WITH THE SPINE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN
LET ME PERSONALLY I USUALLY TRY TO DO THREE SETS OF THESE
JUST FILL THAT AREA THAT'S GOING TO TRY AND NICE IT HERE
ANOTHER ONE IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TWO OR STRING ON THIS THAT THE APPEAR ON THE DUMP THE PLACE AND YOU TRY TO ADD THAT HOP AND THE QUICKEST LONG MOVEMENT
ALRIGHT NOW THAT WE'VE GOT THIS WHAT WE WANT TO BE YOU WANT TO START AND TAKE YOUR SPONGE AND PULLING IT UP AND TRY TO KEEP IT IS EVEN BOTTOM AS POSSIBLE
SO A BIG TO THE BIG INCENTIVE FOR THEM WITH TO TRY TO MAKE CLOCKS THAT WERE INEXPENSIVE
AND OF COURSE YOU CAN TRY THINGS LIKE LITTLE TOP JACKETS LIKE THIS ONE LIKE YOU'RE GOING OUT AT NIGHT
OF COURSE YOU CAN TRY IT WITH LIKE A SWEATER ON TOP DIFFERENT COLORS SWEATERS AND IF YOU LEAVE IN A COOL IN THE COLDER CLIMATE YOU CAN TRY A TRENCH COAT JUST ABOVE YOU KNOW JUST ON TOP OF THE BLACK DRESS
SO TRY THAT AGAIN
SHE'S GOT HER A GOOD POSITION SHE'S STRONGER SEE SHE'S READY TO TRY TO USE THAT DART LIKE STICK IT
YOU PUT ON YOUR GARAGE JUST TRY AND POP A WHEELIE
IT'LL BE A LITTLE BIT SLOWER SO WE CAN TRY TO HIGHLIGHT IN EMPHASIZE THE SKILL AND STRATEGY INVOLVED
AND THEN THE LAST THING IS I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT YOU TRY TO DO CALLIGRAPHY WIDE LIVE WHY LISTENING TO MUSIC
AND THE BALL COMES TO YOU YOU GOT A PERSON YOU TRY TO GO AROUND THEIR DEFENDER NOW YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO THE SIDE COME AROUND ON OUR EASE KIND OF YOU KNOW CUT BACK WHATEVER
WE TEND TO TRY TO READ THE OTHER PERSON'S MIND AND PERCEIVED OF WHAT THEY'RE FEELING WHAT THEY'RE THINKING WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE RELATIONSHIP AND YOU WANT TO AVOID THAT
LET'S JUST TRY CHAIR POSE WITHOUT ARMS JUST LET THEM RELAX BY YOUR SIDE
YOU WANT TO TRY TO GET IT AS EVEN A STREAM OF GLUE AS POSSIBLE AND IF IT GETS THICK IN A SPOT YOU CAN JUST TAKE A TOOTHPICK OR YOUR PIN AND KIND OF STRETCH IT OUT OR MOVE IT AROUND IF IT'S IF IT'S TOO THICK
WE'RE GOING TO REPEAT BETWEEN EIGHT AND FIFTEEN REPS YOU'RE EXHALING AS YOU PUSH UP AND INHALE AS YOU LOWER DOWN SO THINGS TO REALLY THINK ABOUT KEEP YOUR WRIST STRAIGHT TRY NOT TO LET THEM CLOCK TRY NOT TO LET YOUR ELBOWS DROP BELOW THE SHOULDERS KEEP IN LINE WITH THE SHOULDERS AS YOU PUSH UP
YOUR LEFT SIDE YOUR WEAKER SIDE AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WEAKER IF YOUR ARE RIGHT HANDED TRY THROWING THE BALL LEFTY SEE HOW FAR IT GOES
ONE LAST THING YOU CAN TRY TO AFTER YOU'VE BEEN STUDYING SOMEONE SONG STRUCTURE IS TO TAKE A SONG THAT YOU'VE WRITTEN RIGHT OUT THE STRUCTURE THE SAME WAY THAT YOU DID THERE IS TAKE A LOOK AT IT IN AND SAY WHAT IF I TRY WHAT THEY DID AND SWITCH YOUR SONG AROUND A LITTLE BIT THAT WAY
IT'S A NATURAL IT'S NOT WHAT YOU WOULD INSTINCTIVELY DO BUT THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD UPON YOUR IDEAS TO BREAK WITH YOUR INITIAL INSTINCTS AND TRY NEW THINGS
TO GET THEM TO ACTUALLY CATCH IT IT'S REALLY THE SAME THING JUST A MATTER OF TIMING IT RIGHT LET'S TRY IT
WHAT YOU WANT TO TRY TO DO IS MAKE A SECURE IT FLAT SO IT DOESN'T GO OVER THE BOARD
I'M TRAVIS CORPENING AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO TEACH YOU JUST HAVE TO GET RECRUITED INTO A BASKETBALL PROGRAM
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO FIRST OF ALL IS YOU WANT TO TRY YOUR BEST
ONCE YOU TRY FOR YOUR HIGH SCHOOL TEAM IF YOU GET YOUR SKILLS OPEN UP THE WAY YOU CAN MAKE IT AND THAT'S A LOT OF HARD WORK
TRY TO HIT IT WITH THE BITTERS
IT CAN ALSO TRY TO HELP YOU ACHIEVE THAT STRAIGHT HOWEVER THE RELAXER WILL MORE OR LESS TO MORE OF A RELAXATION ON YOUR CURL AND NOT NECESSARILY STRAIGHTEN IT
THE NEXT ONE WILL BE THE FIGURE EIGHT DRILL WHICH YOU GO BETWEEN YOUR LEGS FIGURE EIGHT TRY THAT WAY AND THEN REVERSE IT GO THE OTHER WAY THIRTY SECONDS OF PEAS
TRY TO THIRTY SECONDS ONE WAY AND THIRTY SECONDS THIRTY SECONDS AGAIN FOR THE FOR THE FINISH UP WRAP AND THE LAST ONE YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO TRY AND JUST GET ONE ONE BALL MAYBE HAVE A DEFENSIVE MAN AND WORK ON SIMPLY DRIBBLING
TRY IT ONE WAY AND THEN GO BACK THE OTHER DIRECTION
CRUNCH AND EXHALE AS YOU CONTRACT INHALE BACK DOWN SO YOU CAN GET FRESH OXYGEN WORKING BACK INTO THE MUSCLE BEFORE YOU TRY TO CONTRACT AGAIN AND EXHALE
SO I'M GOING TO SPIN IT CLOCKWISE SPIN I'M GOING TO DO UNDER THE LEG PULLOUTS TO THE ANGLE SET TRY THAT ONE AGAIN
WE'VE ALREADY TALKED A LOT ABOUT FLAT SETS SETTING THE DISC UP FLAT AND TIPPING IT UP FLAT RIGHT NOW WE'RE REALLY GOING TO TRY TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO SET IT UP WITH AN ANGLE
YOU WANT TO DO IS COME IN A NICE EVEN ANGLE WITH YOUR BALANCE TRAINER PLACE ONE FOOT AND TRY AND KEEP IT FAIRLY BALANCE IN THE CENTER OF YOUR BALANCE TRAINER BOTH HANDS ON YOUR MEDICINE BALL
IF YOU HAVE AMMONIA AND I TRY AND TANK BOW THE SAME TIME THAT YOU NEED TO DO SOME MAJOR SURGERY ON YOUR TANK TO TAKE YOUR PROBLEM AND FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS
AS YOU BRING THE BALL DOWN THE FLOOR YOU GOTTA GO AGGRESSIVELY TO TRY TO SCORE
SO I ALWAYS TRY TO KEEP MY WORDS UP HERE
TRY THAT TEN OR TWELVE TIMES IN YOUR GOT YOURSELF A PERFECTLY SET UP TO ACTUALLY PLAY THE INSTRUMENT
IF YOU'RE GETTING LIGHTHEADED YOU'RE PROBABLY JUST BREATHING TO HEAVILY TRY TO FORCE MUCH AIR IN AND OUT
ANOTHER THING I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT IS THE TONGUE POSITION AND I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO SOUND A LITTLE WE'RE BUT JUST TRY IT OUT
TRY NOT TO CUT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE WIRE JUST COME DOWN ON AND TWIST THE SCISSORS AROUND THE WIRE FOR TELL IT'S READY TO COME OFF
THIS AND THEN YOU CAN GRAB A NEW INNER TUBE OR EITHER TRY AND PATCH THE FLAT ONE
IF WE'RE MOVING TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT WE SHOULD ALSO TRY TO KEEP THAT SHOULDER ABOVE THE KNEE AT ALL TIMES ON SO THAT WE'RE NOT LEANING TOO FAR OFF TO ONE SIDE
GIVE IT A TRY SOMETIME BIGGER FULL BODIED REALLY RANGY LONG DEEP LEGS GOOD BREW
