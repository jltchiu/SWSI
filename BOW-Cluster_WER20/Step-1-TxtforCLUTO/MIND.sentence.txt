NOW WHEN I CHOOSE WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF MIND INTENT INVOLVE IT'S NOT JUST PHYSICAL MOVEMENT
SO WHERE DO WE PUT OUR MIND IN THE BODY AS WE'RE DOING THESE MOVEMENT
ANOTHER WAY AND IN MY MIND THIS WOULD BE JUST ABOUT EVERY ARTISTRY IS TO MOVE TO SOME PLACE LIKE YOUR YOUR PARROTS ITALY SOME EXOTIC OR LOCATION ANYWHERE LIKE THAT OPEN UP YOUR LITTLE ART GALLERY YOUR VERY OWN LITTLE ART GALLERY AND JUST PAINT
NOW IF THIS IS YOUR GRIEVING ASPIRATION IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE THIS GET THE SKILL IN THE PASSION GO FOR I THINK THAT'S THE MOST MOBILE WAY IN MY MIND TO MAKE A LIVING AS AN ARTIST

SO KEEP AGAIN IN MIND THAT YOU WANT TO BUILD YOUR ACCESSORY CAPSULE THE SAME WAY YOU DID YOUR CLOTHING WITH KEEPING THREE ELEMENTS GOING ON
KEEP IN MIND THE EXERCISE I DEMONSTRATED ARE JUST FOR THERE'S A VARIETY OF IS THAT WORKS AS WELL
WITH THAT IN MIND I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE SOME MEDICINE BALL EXERCISES THAT OF COURSE OUT AS YOU GET STRONGER YOU INCREASE RESISTANCE LIKE IN A BIG OR SMALL
AND EXHALE LET THE KNEES GO RIGHT DOWN AWAY FROM YOUR SHOULDERS RELEASE AND KEEPING IN MIND IN YOUR HANDS TO THE KNOT GRABBING THE FEET

SO KEEP IN MIND KEEP IT ALL RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF THE SCREEN
SO ALWAYS KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN YOU WANT TO USE THE SUN BROWSER YOU WANT TO USE IT IN THE DISCREET WHITE SOMETHING NOBODY WOULD THINK ABOUT
SO THAT WAY ABOUT BODIES PREPARED MY MIND AS COMPARED PREPARED

SO WITH THOSE THINGS IN MIND WILL JUST LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT A SHEER SO WE WOULD MEASURE THE LENGTH OF THE SO KNOWING THE LENGTH OF OUR SHEARS WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO SIMPLY MEASURE OUT AND WE WANT THE CURTAIN RODS SITTING ABOUT A HALF AN INCH LOWER THAN WHAT THE ACTUAL LENGTH IS
IT MAKES IT LOOK A LITTLE NICER AND SO I I DON'T MIND THAT EFFECT
OR I CAN NOT MIND TO READ
WE TEND TO TRY TO READ THE OTHER PERSON'S MIND AND PERCEIVED OF WHAT THEY'RE FEELING WHAT THEY'RE THINKING WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE RELATIONSHIP AND YOU WANT TO AVOID THAT
THESE ARE PRETTY BASE HEAVY MINORS AND THESE ARE PRETTY FLAT MIND IS THAT I USE TO MIX
MAKE UP YOUR MIND
NOW IF YOU ACTUALLY NOTICE USUALLY YOU WANT TO STICK WITH SOME SORT OF CONSISTENCY ON YOUR FONTS BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR LOGO THEY THEY WANTED SOMETHING THAT WAS THE FOCUS WAS ON THE MIND ONE HERE

SO THIS FIRST CENTERING BOOK HAND IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CREATE THAT SPACE AND ALLOW YOU TO GO INSIDE AND CREATE AN INTENTION PERHAPS TO REALLY GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR BODY TO BRING THAT MIND BODY CONNECTION TOGETHER BEFORE YOU BRING IT BEGIN YOUR PRACTICE
THEY MADE IT WITH THAT IN MIND
SO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE SIGNS ARE THERE FOR YOU TO RECOGNIZE AND REMEMBER WHAT DR PAUL'S SAYS THAT FIRST SIGN IS THAT THE LACK OF COURTESY
KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO GET BETTER
YOU HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THE IN IN IN THIS SPECIFIC EXAMPLE IS IN WHEN THAT MANY OTHER THINGS YOU MIGHT MAKE THE THE CROSS CROSS THE JUMP RING TOSS THE OF THE DRUM WRITING HAT AT TWO AND A HALF CENTIMETERS ONTO A BRACELET
SO I PUT MY MIND INTO THE BOTTOM OF MY BACK FOOT OR INTO MY WAITED FOR THIS IS THE SOURCE OF ALL THE TIME OF HOW WE MOVE AND WHERE WE BEGIN OUR MOVEMENT IT COMES FROM THE GROUND UPWARD
