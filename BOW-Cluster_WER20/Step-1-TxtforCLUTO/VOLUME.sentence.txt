BUT EM WHAT THE TWENTY VOLUME DOES IS IT ALLOWS US TO OPEN THE CUTICLE UP TO THE FIRST FIFTEEN EXCUSE ME FOR THE FIRST FIFTEEN MINUTES TO DEPOSIT THE COLOR AND IT ALLOWS THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR THE LIFT PROCESS
SO GARY JUST DEMONSTRATED A HEART ATTACK IN VOLUME ON THAT ONE A SOFT DROP SHOT
COUNTLESS TIMES YOUR OPPONENT'S NOT READY FOR AN ATTACKING ON VOLUME OF RETURN ALREADY AND DROP
SO DEPENDING ON WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE PLAYING ON MY JUMP AN OCTAVE ABOVE THE VOLUME AND THE CHORUS START PLAYING A PAGES
NOW WE NEED TO GET THE RIGHT TO OUR STRING SO WE'RE GOING TO DO IT OVER THE PIANO HERE GOING TO PLAY A LOW E I'M GOING TO PUT THE VOLUME PEDAL ON GOING ALL GIVE IT A GOOD LISTEN
AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT CONTROLS THE VOLUME OF EVERYTHING IS A HOLD
IT'S IT'S JUST A DOG GLORIFIED VOLUME CONTROL OF THE TWO FADERS
I CAN'T EMPHASIZE AND I'VE GOT TO BE LISTENING TO WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS DOING THAT MAYBE YOU PULL BACK IN VOLUME
THE SECOND THING YOU CAN DO IT FOR INSTANCE DURING THE COURSE OF THE CHORUS BUILDS A BIT AND OTHER WORDS BUILD A BIT ALL BUMP UP THE VOLUME OF THAT
SO FOR INSTANCE IF I'M PLAYING A PASSAGE TO SIT ON MY VOLUME WHETHER IT'S A PETAL OR A SWITCH AND PLAY WITH THE VOLUME
I MAY BE PLAYING JUST AN OPEN TO ADD A LITTLE BIT OF COLOR IN SPARKLE AND BUILD IT A BIT SO ALL OUT A LITTLE VOLUME AND I'LL GO TO OUR PAGES
HERE YOU HAVE YOUR VOLUME CONTROL WHICH YOU CAN GO HIGHER AND LOW
IF YOUR RED LINE AND AS A RED LIGHT COMING ON HOW YOU DOING SOMETHING WRONG YOU SHOULD LOW DOWN YOU KNOW LOW YOU'RE GAINS OR YOU KNOW DEFINITELY LOWER YOUR VOLUME
TAPE ON THE OTHER HAND USUALLY COLORS IT BUT IN A VERY PLEASING WAY ADD SOME NOISE FLOOR JUST A LITTLE HERE THIS KIND OF SETS THE EAR AS TO WHAT VOLUME TO EXPECT
WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING A CURL STYLE ESPECIALLY IF YOUR HAIR STRAIGHT IN OR EVEN HAS A BIT OF A CURL WHERE YOU REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON YOUR BLOWING YOUR HAIR OUT IS YOUR ACTUAL VOLUME OF YOUR HAIR
I RECOMMEND USING A MOVES IN ORDER TO CREATE VOLUME AS YOU'RE PULLING THE HAIR OUT
FIRST THING TRY A TEXTURE RISING SHAMPOO OR SOME TYPE OF VOLUME RISING OR CURL ENHANCING SHAMPOOED TO HELP PUMP UP YOUR CURL
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO PUSH OUR OWN VOLUME UP SO THAT WE CAN BE HEARD
HERE WE HAVE OUR VOLUME CONTROL AND PROGRAM CONTROL
ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO ADD QUICK VOLUME IS JUST A THROW SOME CURLS AND
WHEN TRYING TO MAKE YOUR HAIR LOOK FULLER WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS VOLUME TO THE TOP
AND ANY DJ MIXER YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A GILLAM WHICH IS TO SAY THE VOLUME COMING INTO THE MIXER FROM THE TURNTABLES
AND BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS ALL THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AS YOU DJ IS THE DJ'S BASICALLY ONE STEP THE HEAD OF THE CROWD AND BASICALLY IN THE HEAD PHOTOS CAMERA WRAP THE NEXT OUT BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY BRINGS IT IN AND TURNS THE VOLUME UP IN HERE
SOFT ENOUGH VOLUME TO THE ARM UP
YOU ALSO HAVE YOUR MASTER CHANNEL SUCH AS YOUR MASTER FADER WHICH WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE VOLUME OF THE WHOLE MIX OF YOUR SONG OUR PROJECT
THERE YOU HAVE IT SEVEN MINUTES VOLUME
AND ON EVERY LOOP ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS PRESS THE A BUTTON IN WITH YOUR CALF SOCK OFF AND YOU'RE ABLE TO OPEN UP A WHOLE AUTOMATION SCREEN SET THAT LETS YOU CHANGE THE VOLUME AND RIGHT DIFFERENT CHANGES WITHIN YOUR SONG THAT AUTOMATICALLY ALM WORK AS A SONG PLAYS
AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A VOLUME FADER WHICH CONTROLS THE VOLUME THAT GOES OUT TO THE HOUSE AND THE HOUSE IS BASICALLY WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS LISTENING TO
AND YOU'VE GOT A MASTER VOLUME AND THAT MASTER VOLUME IS YOUR VOLUME FOR THE HOUSE
THEN WE ALSO HAVE THEM VOLUME WISE AND A TWENTY VOLUME BASICALLY IT GETS IN THE CHEMISTRY OF WHAT WE MIX WITH COLOR
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR FIRST OF ALL IS SIMPLY VOLUME CAN WE HEAR YOU
A LOT OF VOLUME ON A LOT OF STANDING OUT
IF YOU SEE THAT WE JUST DREW A VOLUME CHANGE AND AS A SONG PLAY IS ONCE IT GETS THAT POINT IS TO START FADING DOWN AND THEN ONCE IT GOES BACK TO THE NEXT TWO BECAUSE REBECCA ZERO
