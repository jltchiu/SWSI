ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR JACK STANDS SET YOU CAN VERY SLOWLY RELEASE THE PRESSURE ON YOUR FLOOR JACK
HOME AND THEN APPLY PRESSURE INWARD
SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD A LITTLE MORE PRESSURE SHE HAS LIKE A ARTIFICIAL NAIL RIGHT ON THE EDGE THERE SO I'M GOING TO JUST GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE PRESSURE AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL OVER IT JUST A FIELD ONCE IT YOU DON'T FEEL ANY MORE BUMPS AND YOU CAN START WITH YOUR PROPER AND CONTINUE UNTIL YOU'VE GOT IT USED OFF THE SIDES
OKAY NOW ONCE YOU FINISH YOUR ACCU PRESSURE POINTS YOU'VE DONE YOUR MASSAGE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU NOT JUST LEAP UP AND RUN OFF AND HOW THE DOG CHASING AFTER YOU ARE USED FOR THE DOG OUT IN THE YARD OR HAVE AND PLAY WITH THE KIDS
SO I'M GOING TO HAVE THIS PRESSURE PULLING
NOT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THE UP OKAY
IT MAY NOT ACTUALLY GO FLAT AND SO YOU GOT ON THE ROAD AND ACTUALLY HAS SOME SOME SERIOUS PRESSURE UNDER IT AND THEN YOU'LL END UP FIX ANOTHER FLAT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THAT'S NEVER GOOD
WE'LL EVEN AMOUNT OF PRESSURE OR YOU CAN COUNT YOUR STROKES AGAIN BUT FOR NOW JUST MAKE SURE THE REAL FLAT
FOR FOR THIS I'M JUST GOING TO SAY I WANT IT RIGHT HERE IN THIS AREA YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO TAKE YOUR DRILL PLACE THAT ON THAT MARK APPLY A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE TO IT AND YOU JUST WANT TO DRILL
AND ULTIMATELY JUST WANT TO LET THE HEAD RELAX IT AND LET THE BODY RELAX AH AT AND LET THE PRESSURE SO GOOD
THE SECOND IS YOUR PRESSURE FELT AND THIS ACTUALLY IS A BIT THICKER THAN THE OTHER ONES AND IT'S GOING TO ALLOW THAT PAPER TO BE MOLDED DOWN INTO THE MATRIX AND PULL OUT THE INK
WITH THE DOG WITH ELBOW DISPLAY YOU MAY FIND THE DOG DOESN'T LIKE THIS MASSAGE TO START WITH IN WHICH CASE YOU WANT TO START WITH JUST SOME SOFT GENTLE MOVEMENT JUST MOVE YOUR HANDS OVER THE SKIN DON'T PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON AND GRADUALLY WORK YOUR WAY UP
THE NEXT THING YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS ACTUALLY MASSAGE THE ELBOW ITSELF ACTUALLY PUTTING PRESSURE ALL THE WAY AROUND NICE CIRCULAR MOTION WITH YOUR FINGERS ABOVE AND BELOW THE JOINT FRONT AND BACK ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH ALONG THE FRONT OF THE LEG
THE CALIPER THEN PUTS PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PADS SUCH AS THIS IS THE BRAKE PAD AND THAT PRESSURE THEN PUSHES ON THE ROTOR AND APPLY STOPPING POWER FOR THAT ROTOR
NOW WE NEED TO RELEASE A LOT OF THAT PRESSURE VERY FAST
OR AND VERY CAREFULLY I'M JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PUT THIS PAN IN HERE AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS TO THIS LITTLE PRESSURE TOWEL
THIS IS A QUICK SOAKING METHOD TO USE THE PRESSURE COOKER
NOW I HAVE JUST BEEN COOKING THESE BEANS THAT FIFTEEN POUNDS OF PRESSURE FOR JUST TWO MINUTES
RIGHT NOW WE'RE MAKING BLACK BEANS IN A PRESSURE COOKER
A LOT OF TIMES TO YOU SEE THIS X EXCESS STUFF ON THE EDGES JUST SIMPLY JUST TAKE YOUR FINGER AND IT COMES RIGHT OFF JUST LIKE THAT JUST GIVE A LITTLE PRESSURE TO IT IS REALLY NOT A BIG DEAL
GO ABOUT AN INCH ABOVE THE EAR APPLYING PRESSURE HERE PARTICULARLY IF IT FEELS GOOD TO APPLY PRESSURE AND MOVING AROUND THE EAR
YOU WANT PRESSURE ON THE BALL OF THE FOOT
PUT PRESSURE ON THAT TOE
WHAT I'M ACTUALLY DOING ON THIS IS PUTTING MY HAND IN THE COOKING HIS ELBOW IN COLLAPSING IT TO CAUSE PRESSURE RIGHT HERE
SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF FOR IS A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE THAT COMES WITH THAT
AND YOU'LL FEEL SOME PRESSURE
CHRONIC STRESS HAS BEEN FOUND IN NUMEROUS THAT IS TO CONTRIBUTE TO A WIDE RANGE OF THE MOST THOSE AND CONDITIONS INCLUDING ANXIETY DEPRESSION HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND SOME AND HARDER REGULARITY KNEES AND YOUR RECENTLY ADULTS ACCESSIBLE INTO HEART ATTACKS AND HEART DISEASE
BUT YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU KNOW AT THAT IT IS GOING TO TAKE OUR THE TASTE OF THE PRESSURE
AND WHAT THAT DOES IS WHEN THE ELEVATE THEIR HEAD IT PUTS PRESSURE ON IT AND BRINGS IT BACK DOWN
AND AS THEY DO YOU LET THEM RELAX AND IS ONCE YOU FEEL TENSION LINE UP UNDERNEATH AND LET THAT PERSON RELAX AND YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE YOUR HEAD BACK INTO POSITION OR MAINTAIN THAT SAME PRESSURE IN THAT SAME SPOT AS YOU HOLD THAT HEAD UP
NOT WITH TOO MUCH PRESSURE JUST GIVE IT A LITTLE TOE
IF YOU NOTICE I'M STARTING OFF WITH THE PROPER STANCE AND I'M GOING TO BE APPLYING FORWARD PRESSURE TO THIS FOOT AND FOR PRESSURE TO THIS WAY
ALONG WITH THIS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STILT LIFTED TAKING OFF A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE OF YOUR UPHILL SKI
SO IF WE'RE GOING TO BE MAKING A LEFT TELL TURN GOING TO BE APPLYING PRESSURE TO THE RIGHT BOOT
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS APPLY FOR PRESSURE TO THE BOOT THAT'S GOING TO BE A DOWNHILL SKI
SO USE LIGHT PRESSURE MODERATE PRESSURE A HEAVIER PRESSURE
AND BECAUSE THIS IS OFTEN A SENSITIVE AREA AND HORSE I WILL USE LIGHT PRESSURE THERE LONGER THAN I MIGHT IN ANOTHER AREA JUST TO GET THINGS LOOSENED UP
PRETTY MUCH WHAT YOU WANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS PUTTING FORWARD PRESSURE AND ALLOWING THE SKI TO WORK WITH THAT WITH ITS ACTUAL SHAPE INSTEAD OF CHINA MUSCLE THE SKI AROUND LIKE BEFORE
THE DIFFERENCE IS SET OF LANE SO MUCH PRESSURE ON THIS FOOT AND SWITCH YOUR BODY AROUND YOU'RE GOING TO PUT FOUR PRESSURE ON YOUR BOOT SO NOT ALLOW THE INSIDE EDGE OF THE SPEED WORK BY ITSELF AND CARVE THE TURN OUT
WHEN YOU'RE SHIFTING SPEED WHAT YOU DO IS YOU SHIFT THE WEIGHT TO THE FOUR PRESSURE OF THIS THROUGH AND IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU CARD THIS TURN OUT
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR BOTTOM DOESN'T DROP PUTTING PRESSURE YOUR LOWER BACK
AFTER GETTING THAT TIRE PRESSURE IS EQUAL ON ALL FOUR WHEELS ROUGH IS GOING TO START BY MEASURING PRETTY MUCH ON LINE STRAIGHT THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE WHEEL IS NOT TO WEAR THAT LINE INTERSECTS DEFENDER
WE HAVE LEARNED HOW TO PUT THE PRESSURE ON SKIS TO A DEGREE
YOU CAN DO A STEADY ONE FINGER PRESSURE TO STAYING IN THAT PLACE OR YOU CAN DO CIRCULAR MOTION WITH YOUR THUMB OR WITH THE BALL OF YOUR FINGER
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR PRESSURE
IT'S KIND OF SOOTHING BUT YET GIVES A NICE DEEP FIRM PRESSURE
SO YOU'RE SITTING TALL INHALING AND EXHALING THROUGH YOUR NOSE BREATHS OR LONG AND STRONG AND JUST BRING A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE BETWEEN THE PALMS
SEE IF YOU CAN HOLD THIS FOR SAY FIVE TO TEN BREATHS JUST THAT GENTLE GENTER GENTLE PRESSURE MAKING AWARE OF YOUR CENTER POINT MAKING YOU AWARE OF THIS POWER IN YOUR ARMS AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE EXHALE TO RELEASE JUST LET YOUR HANDS FALL TO YOUR KNEE
A HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE DIABETES UCHI GO AHEAD AND KNOWING TO EVEN HELP WITH THE MISSION OF CANCER
OKAY SOMETIMES IN SQUASH YOUR OPPONENT PUT YOU UNDER GREAT PRESSURE AND SO AS WE SHOT ALL YOUR TRADITIONAL A BACKHAND DROP SHOT WILL BE SOMEWHAT LIKE A MINI DROWN STROKE OR MANY VOLLEY ALL THE LIKE THAT
NOW WE'VE GOT SEVERAL CHOICE IS THE FINISH THIS ACTUALLY HAS A PRETTY GOOD FINISH THAT NEEDS TO BE PRESSURE AND UP AND WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST THING TO DO SINCE THE BARNISH ON THIS IS REALLY AGE WOULD BE TO USE A STRIPPER ON THIS ENTIRE PIECE
YOU PUT THAT PRESSURE THERE IS TO STEADY PRESSURE OR YOU CAN DO A ROCKING MOTION JUST BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH AND THAT'S ONE THAT SHE OBJECTS TO THIS WILL HAPPEN SOMETIMES WITH YOUR ANIMAL THAT THEY'LL OBJECT TO A POINT
MOVE DOWN AND A LITTLE BIT BACK AND YOU'RE GOING TO FALL INTO A SPACE BETWEEN THE MUSCLE TENDON AND THE KICK AND THE BOTTOM AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUT STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN PRESSURE IN THAT AREA
AND AS I WORK MY WAY DOWN THE FLOOR IN YOUR WAIST I'LL COME AT A SIDEWAYS MOTION AND THEN AS I WORK DOWN TOWARDS THE INTESTINES OR THE HEEL I'LL TAKE MY FIST AND KNUCKLE AND APPLY A FIRM PRESSURE WITH A ROTATING MOTION WHICH REALLY STIMULATES THEIR LIMB PULLS AND HAS PRETTY GOOD
SO THERE'S GOING TO BE THIS PRESSURE AND DISCOMFORT HERE IN THIS AREA AND IN ORDER TO AND AS I WORK THIS AREA IT WILL HELP TO ACTUALLY BALANCE OUT ON THE ADRENAL IN HER BODY
OKAY SO HIS BLOOD PRESSURE THERE NOW IS ONE FORTY OVER EIGHT
SO WE JUST TOOK BOB TO HIS TARGET HEART RATE AND WHAT WE SIDE THAT HE DID SOME EXERCISE NOW WE WANT TO DEMONSTRATE SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED AND HIS BLOOD PRESSURE NOW THAT WE'VE DONE THAT YOU CAN
HI I'M DR TARA NOW AND WE WANT TO DEMONSTRATE SOME OF THE CHANGES IN BLOOD PRESSURE THAT OCCUR WITH ACTIVITY
WE HAVE A TARGET FRAME HERE WHICH WAS BUILT UP OUT OF A PRESSURE TREATED WOOD
SO WHAT I NEED TO DO IS HE HAS PRESSURE IN AS I KEEP THE BLOOM BUT I SIT AND TURN
THE NINETY POUNDS OF PRESSURE WITH THE CHILD THAT CANNOT HOLDER HEAD UP YET
IT'S THAT IS IT ACTUALLY SHOWN THAT THE DOCTOR'S PULLED ABOUT THE FORCE OF ABOUT NINETY POUNDS OF PRESSURE
SO YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DRAG YOUR FOOT UP PUT PRESSURE ON THE NOSE POP OUT AND MAKE SURE THAT YOUR WHEELS CLEAR THE TOP OF THE OBSTACLE
AFTER YOU'VE OLLIED OVER THE BEGINNING OF THE LEDGE YOU WANT TO GO OVER THE TOP LAND ON TOP OF THE LEDGE PUTTING ALL THE PRESSURE RIGHT HERE AND HANGING YOUR NOSE JUST OVER THE TIP OF THE LEDGE ITSELF
SO YOU WANT TO GET A GOOD SOLID FEEL ON HOW MUCH PRESSURE YOU WANT TO PUT IN THAT KITE
IF YOU HAVE A KITE OR UP PUMP RIGHT HERE SOMETIMES IT'LL COME WITH A PRESSURE GAUGE
SO I'VE PUT THE THE FRUIT ALMOST OF THE PRESSURE TO THE TOP OF THE WALL
THAT TOP NUMBER IS YOUR SAYS STYLE OF PRESSURE AND THE BOTTOM NUMBER IS YOUR DICED ON PRESSURE AND WHAT THOSE PRESSURES REPRESENT IS A THEY REPRESENT A PRESSURE WITHIN THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM WHICH IS THE A ORDER AND THE PRESSURE WITH IN THIS IS A REPRESENTATION OF THE PRESSURE IN THE ORDER WHEN YOU TAKE SOMEONE'S BLOOD PRESSURE
SO THIS CYST ALL THE PRESSURE IS THE PRESSURE WITHIN THE ORDER JUST AFTER THAT HARD CAN TRACKS
THIS SAY YOUR IS FILLED UP WITH HIGHER AMOUNT OF PRESSURE
OKAY SO WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT BLOOD PRESSURE IS
A BLOOD PRESSURE IS DIVIDED INTO CYST ALL OF PRESSURE AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURE AND THOSE PRESSURES REPRESENT DIFFERENT SLIGHT DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE CARDIAC CYCLE
SO IT'S THE PRESSURE WITH IN THE ORDER OR THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM UP MORE SO THE BRAKE YOU'LL ARTERY AFTER THAT HARD CONTRACT
AND THE DIASTOLIC PRESSURE IS THE PRESSURE WITHIN THAT ARTERIAL SYSTEM JUST AFTER THE HEART RELAXES SO WE HAVE CONSTANT CONTRACTION RIGHT HERE IN THIS FAN TRICKLE SHOOTS PLUG UP THROUGH THE THE ORDER AND THEN IT RELAXES
THE SHOCK ABSORBER CONTAINS PRESSURE IN IS CONSTANTLY TRYING TO PUSH OUTWARDS SO IT HOLD ITSELF IN PLACE PRETTY GOOD
I'M NOT APPLYING ANY PRESSURE TO THE ROLLER I'M JUST LETTING IT COAST ALONG THE WALL
WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO IS THAT THE SPINE IS REALLY THE HOUSE THAT PROTECTS THE NERVES THAT ARE TRANSMITTING THESE MESSAGES AND SO AS THE SPINE GETS MISALIGNED AS THE SPINE BECOMES TORQUED TWISTED WHAT HAVE YOU IT PUTS PRESSURE ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT THEN ASCENDING THE MESSAGES OUT AND WHICH CAN BE PAINT OR FUNCTION
SO PAIN FIBERS ARE BEING AFFECTED THEY'RE GOING TO FEEL PAINT THAT'S BURNING RADIATING PAINT LOCAL PAIN MUSCLE TENSION PRESSURE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS
SO I LIKE TO DO IS LITTLE CIRCLES AND THIS LOCATION AND JUST CLOSE MY EYES AND RELAX AND WITH THE PRESSURE JUST FEEL THE MUSCLES UNDERNEATH RELAXING SCREEN UP CLEARING AT ANY PAIN
THIS ONE I HAVE TO DO MORE OF A FLAT SURFACE PRESSURE
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT PREFER DEEPER BUT JUST OVERALL KIND OF JUST PRESSURE IN BIGGER CIRCLES AGAIN CLOSING THE EYES AND IF A DARK ROOM IS HELPFUL THAT CAN ALSO BE BENEFICIAL
THE PRESSURE DECREASES SO THAT'S WHY THAT DIASTOLIC IS A LITTLE BIT LOWER
BACK OFF GO DOWN TO MODERATE PRESSURE AGAIN GO DOWN TO LIGHT PRESSURE FINISH UP WITH LIGHT PRESSURE
SO IT'S JUST LIKE THIS IT'S NOTHING GREAT IS REALLY EFFECTIVE SHOT FOR WHEN YOU ARE GREAT PRESSURE
ALSO WHAT WHAT RAZOR YOU CAN BETTER CONTROL THE PRESSURE OF THE RAZOR HITTING THE SKIN
I'M GOING TO TAKE AND RUN MY PRESSURE WASHER AND CLEAN IT ALL UP REAL GOOD TO GET UP ALL THE DIRT AND THEM LOOSE DEBRIS AND STUFF AND THEN I'M GOING TO TAKE AND SPRAY AND PAT ON A TWO COATS OF OF A SOLID STAIN
YOU CAN CHECK OCCASIONALLY BY RUNNING YOUR HAND OVER TO SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY BUMPS OR LUMPS AND THEN YOU CAN PUT A LITTLE MORE PRESSURE ON THAT PART THAT IT'S MORE LUMPY
AND AS WITH MOST TACKY PRESSURE POINTS YOUR FINGERS ARE GOING TO FALL INTO THIS HOLE
SO IT PUTS LOW PRESSURE INTO THE BOTTOM AND THEN PULL
AND THEN IN THE NEXT SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT OF PHYSIOLOGY BEHIND HOW THAT BLOOD PRESSURE IS CHANGING
SO WE TOOK BOB'S BLOOD PRESSURE EARLIER WAS AROUND ONE TWENTY OVER EIGHTY AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN EXERCISE AND TAKE IS BLOOD PRESSURE AGAIN AND SEE HOW THOSE CHANGES OCCUR
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO INVITE THE PALMS TO YOUR HEART AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE EQUAL PRESSURE BETWEEN THE KNEES AND THE PALMS
OKAY AND YOU FEEL THE PRESSURE ON THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT
ONE THING THAT I KNOW THAT A LOT OF DRIVERS GO DO IS WHEN THEY GET ALL TEN STEP AND THEY ARE BUILT TO DOWN YOU KNOW THIS PRESSURE THEY DON'T THEY DON'T BREEZE
AND TAKE THAT PRESSURE OFF OF YOU THAT YOU KNOW WHAT IF I DO THE WRONG THING
SO I'M GOING TO COME OVER UNDER MY KNEES AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO SPREAD MY TOES AS WIDE AS I CAN AND JUST SIT BACK ON MY HEELS ADDING A LITTLE PRESSURE
AND YOU WANT TO GIVE SOME TYPE OF DID LINE FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL ARE ENTITY WITHIN WHICH TIME TO RESPOND BECAUSE IT WILL PUT SOME PRESSURE ON THEM TO RESPOND TO YOUR DEMAND
THE NEXT THING THAT WE NEED TO DO IS RELIEVE ANY WATER PRESSURE THAT IS STILL IN THE LINES SO YOU CAN GO TO ANY FAUCET IN YOUR HOUSE AND TURN THAT ON AND WEIGHTS WHOLE ALL THAT PRESSURE HAS BEEN RELIEVE FROM THE FAUCET
I'M GOING TO MAKE IT A LEFT TILT ARE GOING TO BE A PLAN FOR PRESSURE TO YOUR LEFT IT
AN ARROW SPRAYER PUMPS THE PAINT THROUGH YOUR ORIFICE AND MAKES IT OUT INTO YOUR YOUR YOUR FIND SPRAY FINISH AND YOU HAVE YOUR ADJUSTMENT ON HERE TO ADJUST YOUR PRESSURE
I ADJUST THE PRESSURE WAY DOWN TO PUT IT ON A DECK BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO THIS YOU'RE NOZZLE YOUR TIPS ONLY GOING TO BE ABOUT SIX TO TEN INCHES OFF THE DEAD YOU SPRAY IT BACK AND FORTH AND YOU JUST PUT THE THE PRODUCT WHERE YOU NEED IT AND THEN MY HELP COMES ALONG WE PAT IT DOWN INTO THE DECK AND IT MAKES A GREAT FINISH
BUT IN USED IN A PERFORMANCE HORSE THIS IS GOING TO PUT ENOUGH PRESSURE TO THE ROOF OF THEIR MOUTH THAT WITH VERY LITTLE HAND MOVEMENT THIS BIT IS GOING TO PUT THEM RIGHT WHERE I NEED EM IN WITHOUT ANY HAND MOVEMENT ON MY PART
I'M PUSHING IN WITH THE POINT IT AREA AND GENTLY TWISTING SO THAT I DON'T HAVE TO PUSH HAVE TOO MUCH PRESSURE GOING IN WORDS AND ONCE I'VE GOT THE LARGE HOLE CUT I CAN MAKE LITTLE MARKS AT SYMMETRICAL LOCATIONS FOR THE MEAT MID GREAT SIZE AND FINALLY WITH THE SMALLEST SIZE
STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN PRESSURE ON BOTH SIDES
AND THAT WILL PUT LESS PRESSURE ON THE GOOD LEG AND ALLOW THEM TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE
IT WILL ONLY TAKE JUST A MINUTE TO DO A QUICK RELEASE OF PRESSURE AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND JUST COOK THE BEANS ONE MORE TIME FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES
I DON'T WANT THE COLD WATER TO BE GETTING INSIDE THE PAN TO SEE THIS PRESSURE IS DROPPING DRAMATICALLY IT'S GONE FOR FIFTEEN POUNDS IT'S NOW ALMOST PAST THE EIGHT POUND MARK
A MANUAL ALSO CALLED A WHEELIE IS WHEN YOU BALANCE ON YOUR BACK TWO WHEELS ALONE PROVIDING EQUAL AMOUNT OF PRESSURE TO THE TAIL AND THE CENTER OF YOUR BOARD THERE FOR YOU NOT WANT TO SCRAPE YOUR TAIL OR LET YOUR FRONT WHEELS HIT
YOU CAN AND THEN JUST INFLATED TO YOUR RECOMMENDED INFLATION PRESSURE
YOU'LL WANT TO KEEP SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE STRING
EQUAL PRESSURE ON THE PEDALS ALL THE WAY AROUND
SOME OF THOSE ONES THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO GET OFF YOU MIGHT EVEN TRY TO GO INTO A CAR WASH AND USING A HIGH PRESSURE GOING ON
NOW YOU WANT TO GENTLY UNSCREW IT A LITTLE BIT OF PULL PRESSURE AS YOU DO THAT NIGHT BECAUSE THIS PIECE RIGHT OVER HERE ON THE MASK YOU DON'T WANT TO BREAK ALRIGHT
SO THIS PRESSURE YOU'RE OF YOUR GREAT PICK FOR THIS PARTICULAR OUTFIT
YOU SHOULD FEEL NICE OPENING THROUGH YOUR SO AS HERE AND IF YOU'RE FEELING LOTS AND LOTS OF PRESSURE ON YOUR FRONT SIDE IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE LEANING TOO FAR FORWARD
NOW ON THE FOREHAND SIDE YOU CAN GO ALL LAUGHED BIG AND RIGHT YOU CAN COVER A HUGE MANA CHORD IF YOU TAKE YOU THAT'S USUALLY DO THAT WHEN YOU'RE UNDER SOME TYPE OF PRESSURE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE THE STRONGEST POSITION SO YOU CAN SEE IF YOU'RE HERE YOU'RE IN KIND OF A RELATIVELY WE POSITION AND YOU CAN TURN IT AROUND IS A GOOD SHOT BUT TO GETTING TO THE CORNER MORE UPRIGHT POSITION IS BETTER
GOOD SOON AS ALL FOURS HIT THE GROUND I RELEASE PRESSURE OFF THE LEASH AND STAND AND SHE SHOULD REMAIN IN A DOWN POSITION
THIS HAND GOES PALM UP SLIGHTLY FORWARD PRESSURE AND I'M USING MY FOREARM AGAINST THE SIDE TO HAVE HER DOWN
IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE HOME THAT CAN HELP YOU THIS EXERCISE I CAN ACTUALLY APPLY PRESSURE UNTIL SHE FEELS THAT TENSION MAKES IT A LITTLE EASIER FOR AND THEN SHE TIMING WHEN SHE'S THERE AND THEN WE RELEASE AND THEN THE LAST STRETCH TO BE UP AN OVERHEAD SHOULD DO THAT TRICEP STRETCH
HORSES MOVE AWAY FROM PRESSURE SO WHEN I SQUEEZE MY LEFT LEG IS GOING TO WANT TO MOVE TO THE RIGHT
DO A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE POINT A LOT OF DARK CIRCLES CAN BE CAUSED FROM EITHER SINUS CONGESTION OR JUST BECAUSE THE SKIN SO THIN THERE A LOT OF BLOOD LAYING VERY CLOSE TO THE SURFACE
TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON IT AND CLOSE UP THE PORES
OTHER THINGS THAT WE CAN OFTEN USE THAT WE USE JUST LOTS OF DIFFERENT PRESSURE MATERIALS A LOT OF THINGS IN DENTISTRY WE DO WE REQUIRE SOME SORT OF MOLD OF THE PATIENTS MOUTH SO THERE'S VARIOUS MATERIALS DEPENDING ON WHAT SORT OF PROSTHESIS YOU'RE MAKING THE PATIENT
WE USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PRESSURE MATERIALS
WE CAN PICK UP THE BOX PUT IT ON THE PRESSURE PLATE AND LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOT QUITE THE EXIT YET
I START WITH A LIGHT PRESSURE FIRST TO JUST KIND OF GET THE CIRCULATION GET THAT GETS THE LIQUID BUILDUP MOVEMENT DOWN AND ESPECIALLY WITH THIS DRINK WATER BECAUSE YOU ARE YOU ARE MOVING TOXINS YOU ARE MOVING THE BUILDUP FLUID THAT CAUSES IN THE KNUCKLES THIS WILL WIN KNUCKLES AND GETTING THE CIRCULATION BACK
NO MATTER HOW MUCH PRESSURE YOU PUT ON THIS YOU'LL STILL BE ABLE TO UNTIE IT
IN THAT THINGS TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH PRESSURE YOU'RE GOING TO USE TO REMOVE THE RIDGES IN THE MAIL IS GOING TO DEPEND ON THE SIZE OF THE RIDGE
LOW SO YOU WANT TO TAKE A BLUSH PRESSURE POWDER BRUSH
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO GO LIFTING YOUR HEELS UP LIKE THIS BUT YOU WANT TO FEEL THE PRESSURE OKAY ON THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT
NOW GATHER OFF THE EXTRA BAG AND IN YOUR HAND LIKE THIS WITH YOUR THUMB AND YOUR FINGER HOLDING THE PASTRY BAG AND YOUR PALM IS GOING TO DO THE SQUEEZING YOU TWIST THE BAG SO THIS IS YOUR THUMB AND YOUR FINGER HOLDING THE EXCESS BAG AND YOU'RE TWISTING LIKE THIS TO PUT SOME PRESSURE ON THE CONS
YOU'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING SOME PRESSURE ON THERE
IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PRESSURE WASH YOUR POOL BACK AREA
SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE PRESSURE WASHER FOR IN A LARGER SWEEPING MOTION
