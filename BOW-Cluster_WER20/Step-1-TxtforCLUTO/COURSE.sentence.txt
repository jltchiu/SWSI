BUT OF COURSE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT USEFUL FOR US THERE IS GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF MODIFICATION TO GET WHERE WE NEED TO BE
BUT YOU CAN USE IT OF COURSE IN MANY DIFFERENT DISHES
THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO WHEN SELECTING IS TO PICK YOUR OFFHAND OF COURSE
OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE OUT EVERYTHING YOU BRING IN SO ANYTHING ANY FOOD WASTE ANY OF THOSE THINGS ARE GOING TO TAKE OUT BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN STILL TELL THAT THIS AREA IS BEING WALKED ON ENCAMPED ON AND THE SOMEONE SPEND THE NIGHT HERE
