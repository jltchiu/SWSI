THIS IS CREATURE SPECIFIC FOR COLOR WHICH MEANS YOU WOULD PUT THIS IN YOUR SIDEBOARD TO YOUR MAIN DECK AND IF YOU RUN ACROSS SOMEONE WHO'S RUNNING HEAVY GREEN OR WHITE CREATURES THEN YOU WOULD PLACE THIS CARD IN THERE AND BASICALLY YOU'RE GETTING A FREE TEAR BECAUSE TEAR COSTS YOU ONE AND A BLACK AND THIS ONLY COST YOU A BLACK TO DESTROY TARGET GREEN OR A CREATURE
