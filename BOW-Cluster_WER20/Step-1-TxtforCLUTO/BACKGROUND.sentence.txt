WE'LL JUST SET THE BACKGROUND TO BLACK INSIDE FLASH AND THEN WE HAVE THIS PURPLE OUT WORK THAT I CREATED ON TOP SO THAT'S THE ONLY ONE I'LL BRING IN AND OF COURSE I NEED IT BACKGROUND ART
I LIKE TO START OFF WITH THE BACKGROUND FIRST WILL TURN OFF THESE LAYERS
NOW THE BACKGROUND IS THE ONLY TWO LAYERS IN THIS BLACK BACK THAT I HAVE HERE IS THE ONLY LAYER THAT I WON'T IMPORTANT THE FLASH
AND AGAIN AS I SAID ON SOME OF THOSE PAINTINGS WE WE SOFTEN THE BACKGROUND BY DABBING WITH KLEENEX
IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO LIGHT A PIECE OF PLEXIGLASS FROM BELOW TO ACHIEVE THE WHITE BACKGROUND FOR PIECE OF JEWELRY
AND IF I COME DOWN HERE TO STYLE ATTRIBUTES I CAN CHANGE THE BACKGROUND COLOR
THIS WOULD BE A BACKGROUND LIGHT
LET'S ADD ANOTHER LIGHT JUST TO DEAL WITH THE BACKGROUND
THEN YOU WANT TO HAVE WHAT'S CALLED THE HAIR LIGHT IT WILL BE AND AT THE BACK OF THE MODELS HEAD SO THAT THEY'RE HAIR STANDS OUT FROM THE BACKGROUND AND SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THE DEPTH OF THEIR HEAD ACTUALLY
AND OF COURSE YOU WANT TO HAVE ONE OR TWO LIGHTS ON THE BACKGROUND SO THAT THE MODEL STANDS OUT FROM THE BACKGROUND AND IS TO FIND AGAINST THE BACKGROUND AND YOU CAN DO SOMETHING INTERESTING WITH THAT AS WELL YOU CAN PUT A GEL ON THAT TO MAKE IT A DIFFERENT COLOR OR YOU CAN PUT A TEXTURED FABRIC UP ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING AND GIVE THE EFFECT THAT YOU WANT TO GET
NOW YOU SEE HOW THE BACK LIKE CUTS ME OUT OF THE BACKGROUND
WHAT WAS THERE RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND
AND SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO IMAGES ONLY AND SHE'S GOING TO SAY THAT IMAGE BACKGROUND DOTS ACTIVE
I JUST SECURE THE ICE IN PLACE OR I'M GOING TO DO IS JUST FOLDED UNDERNEATH I'M GOING TO GET WHITE BACKGROUND
AND LET'S SELECT OUR BACKGROUND COLOR LIKE SO
WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS TO TAKE THE RECTANGULAR MARQUIS TOOL AND JUST GRAB IT A SMALL PORTION OF THE PICTURE JUST BY GOING CREATING THE MARK G AND THEN GOING EDIT COPY AND THEN YOU CAN CLOSE THAT IMAGE IN PASTED EDIT PASTE RIGHT INTO OUR BACKGROUND PICTURE
GOOD HIT SAVE I'M GOING TO SAVE THIS IS BACKGROUND DOT IN THE FILE WITH THE REST OF MY FOLDERS FOR THIS WEBSITE
NOW THAT I'VE CREATED A BACKGROUND IMAGE WE'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO SAVE THAT FILE
AND SO IF YOU SEE RIGHT HERE AND PHOTO SHOP I'VE CREATED THIS YELLOW POLKA DOT IN A WHITE BACKGROUND IS FABULOUS AND I'M GOING TO GO UP HERE AND GO TO FILE AND BOTH PHOTO SHOP AN ILLUSTRATOR I HAVE THIS GREAT LITTLE FEATURE CALLED SAFER WEB AND THAT WILL AUTOMATICALLY KIND OF JUST MOST OF THE OPTIONS
NOW YOU'LL NOTICE THAT OFF TO THE SIDES HERE WE HAVE QUITE A BIT OF WHITE SPACE AND OF COURSE WE HAVE A GREEN BACKGROUND
SO IT'S CRITICAL TO TRY AND BACK LIGHT JEWELRY IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET A PURE WHITE BACKGROUND AND THE WAY OF DOING THAT THAT I THINK THE BEST WAY OF DOING THAT IS A PIECE OF CLEAR WHITE PLEXIGLASS IT'S GOING TO ALLOW THE LIGHT TO COME THROUGH AND GIVE YOU THAT WHITE BACKGROUND WITHOUT OVEREXPOSING THE JEWELRY ITSELF
AFFECTION IS REAL KEY BUT IT IT DOESN'T FEEL SOME OF THESE FUNDAMENTAL VOICE THAT PERSON MAYBE HAVING IN A BACKGROUND SO YOU REALLY NEED TO SET THE PARAMETERS FOR YOUR RELATIONSHIP
SO WE HAVE THIS BACKGROUND HERE CLOSE THE DOOR AND SINCE I HAVE A TRIPOD I'M GOING TO HAVE THE CAMERA ON THE TRIPOD
YOU KNOW IS SORT OF A BITTERSWEET AND IT'S A BACKGROUND TO ALL THIS UP ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL INGREDIENTS WE PUT IN
I'M SHOOTING MY MODEL ALIX OUT FROM FROM A LOWER LEVEL AND THIS WAY I'VE GOT THE SKY LINE IN MANHATTAN THE BACKGROUND SHE LOOKS QUITE A BIT TALLER AND IT JUST GIVES YOU A DIFFERENT LOOK WHEN YOUR WITH YOUR SHOOT
ON BOTH OF THEM YOU'LL NOTICE THE BACKGROUND HAS BEEN SOFTENED BY USING KLEENEX TO DAB THE WAX WHEN I WAS ON THE PANCAKE GRETEL
SO THOSE ARE SOME EXAMPLES ON HERE'S ANOTHER ONE THAT'S A LITTLE MORE UNUSUAL YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THAT THUMB THERE'S MORE GREEN IN WHITE BACKGROUND TO THIS LEAFY LINE ON IT
SO LET'S DO WITH THE BACKGROUND LITTLE BIT MORE
AND YOU KNOW A COUPLE TIMES JUST WORKING IT IN AND OUT OF THE BIRD AND THAT IS HOW TO PUMP BACKGROUND IN
HERE'S A THERE'S A BACKGROUND TEXTURE THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING
RIGHT NOW IS WE PUSH BACK IN NOTE WITHIN OUR BACKGROUND YOU CAN SEE HOW IT BUILDS UP
OKAY YOU SEE HOW I COULD FALL FLAT AND BECOME PART OF THE BACKGROUND
YOU KNOW I CAN PUT THE BROWN HERE BUT THAT'S THE ONE THAT YOU SEE FIRST AND THEN THE BACKGROUND OF THAT I PUT THIS KIND OF MUSTARD COLOR HERE
AS A CHEERLEADER IT'S IMPORTANT TO DEFINITELY HAS IN GYMNASTICS BACKGROUND IN YOUR TRAINING
AND IF YOU COME DOWN HERE YOU CAN CHANGE THE FILL COLOR OF THE BACKGROUND
SITTING CAUSE A VERY HIGH OFF CLASS A TOP WHICH WILL TEND TO BE A LOT OF BITTERNESS IT HAS A VERY VERY UNIQUE STRONG PINE ALMOST CANDY LIKE AROMA WHICH PROVIDE A GREAT BACKGROUND FOR OUR BEER
IN FACT SUNDER FILE FISH CAN DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE COLORS TO BETTER BLEND IN WITH THEIR BACKGROUND
SO LOOK HERE WE'VE GOT IT MAY USING COBALT BLUE SKY BRIGHT RED BALCONY YELLOW WOOL AND THE BLUE JACUZZI WITH THE GREEN IN THE BACKGROUND
YOU MIGHT HAVE A BETTER ESPECIALLY IF YOUR PARENTS YOU MIGHT HAVE A BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR MEDICAL BACKGROUND ANY KIND OF MAJOR EVENTS
LIGHT IT SO THAT EVERYTHING IS VISIBLE ON AND THEN COME BACK IN USE OTHER LIGHTS TO BE TO USE TO CREATE HIGHLIGHTS DRAMA DIFFUSION SO THAT YOU'RE NOT SEEING DISTRACTING REFLECTION BIRTH REFRACTOR WRIST REFLECTIONS OR WRIST FRACTIONS ON THE SURFACE OF THE INSTRUMENTS AND THEN COME UP WITH A LIGHTING SYSTEM THAT WORKS TO HELP SEPARATED FROM THE BACKGROUND AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET SOME PRETTY INTERESTING PRODUCT SHOTS
MOST PERSONAL TRAINERS HAVE A BACKGROUND AND CAN YOU SEE ALL THE G OR EXERCISE SCIENCE
WHEN YOU CREATE YOUR CHARACTERS YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DRAW ON YOUR OWN INTEREST YOUR OWN EXPERTISE HELP STRENGTHEN YOUR CHARACTERS BACKGROUND
LIKE I SAID THIS ONE IS IDEAL FOR ME BECAUSE IT'S IN A QUITE NEIGHBORHOOD A I'VE GOT THE SHADE OF THIS UMBRELLA IF I NEED IT AND I CAN POP THAT OVER AND KINDA RIGHT HERE WITH THE NICE BACKGROUND
THAT WAS STARTING POINT IS GOING TO BE THE FOREGROUND COLOR OR THE BACKGROUND COLOR NO FOR COLOR IN THE ENDING POINT IS GOING TO BE BACKGROUND COLOR
IT WILL TRY TO GIVE YOU THE LARGEST APERTURE SETTING IN ORDER TO MAKE THE BACKGROUND BLUR OUT A LOT AND WILL HELP TO MAKE YOUR YOUR SUBJECT OR YOUR YOUR PORTRAIT INDIVIDUAL STAND OUT FOR THE BACKGROUND
WHEN YOU'RE TAKING PORTRAITS IT'S IT'S REALLY GOOD IDEA TO MAKE THE BACKGROUND AS FAR AWAY FROM THE SUBJECT AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM STICK OUT FROM THE BACKGROUND
AND IF YOU HAVE A TELEPHOTO LENS THAT WILL ALSO HELP TO BLOW THE BACKGROUND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
SO THE BACKGROUND WOULD BE THIS AND THAT'LL CREATE A NICE BACKGROUND LOTS OF VEGETATION NOTHING UGLY SO THAT SHOULD BE NICE AND SOME BEHIND ME
FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE A HEART IN THE MIDDLE OR A SUN YOU WANT TO START WITH THAT SHAPE AND TILE THAT WHOLE SHAPE AND THEN TILE THE BACKGROUND
BUT YOU COMPLETE INTO AND THEN USE YOU CAN SEE THE ILLUMINATES THE BACKGROUND A LITTLE BIT MORE
HOW TO GET A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SHOTS AH EITHER THROUGH VARYING YOUR PERSPECTIVE ODD FROM LOW TO HIGH VARYING WHAT IS IN THE BACKGROUND AND SO FORTH
AND AGAIN I'M STILL CAUGHT FROM THE BACKGROUND THAT NICE CROWDING ON THE SHOULDERS AND THE HEAD BUT I'M STILL AND SHADOW
I DON'T WANT TO ADD OUR GRADIENT BACKGROUND SO I'VE CHOSEN A COUPLE BLUE COLORS HERE BECAUSE AS WE'RE MIGRAINES GOING PULL FROM
IF YOU LOOK AT OUR SCREEN HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT I HAVE THIS A SUNFLOWER THEY'VE ROUGHLY KIND OF ITS BACKGROUND
LET'S DO A FULL GRADIENT BACKGROUND COLOR SO I'LL GRAB THAT ONE
NOW WE CAN KNOCK OUT THE GREEN BACKGROUND IN PHOTO SHOP OR ANOTHER PROGRAM BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH THIS WHITE SPACES WE HAVE TO PAINT AROUND THE IMAGE SO THAT WE HAVE THIS BLEND INTO A SKIN TONE
ONE OF THE MAJOR THINGS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR ROOT THE ROOM THAT YOU'RE SLEEPING IN DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF NOISE BACKGROUND ENVIRONMENT AND THAT IS DARK ENOUGH
THE NEXT THING THAT THE SOFT BOXES HEEL YOU CAN ELIMINATE THE BACKGROUND ALSO AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT A BIG STRONG SHADOW
