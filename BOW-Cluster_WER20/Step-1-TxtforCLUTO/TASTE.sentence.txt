YOU HAVE MORE OR LESS DEPENDING ON YOUR TASTE
IN THIS STEP I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE THE PROPER JACKING PROCEDURE FOR GETTING A FRIEND OF OUR TRUCK UP SO WE CAN FIT UNDERNEATH YOU CHANGE OUR TRANSFER TASTE TO IT
SO AS YOU TASTE IT I ALSO LEARN IN THE KITCHEN IT'S ALWAYS BETTER TO HAVE TO ADD SOME THINGS THAT HAVE TO TAKE IT AWAY YOU PUT TOO MUCH
TODAY I WAS USING A SAUCE JUST TRYING TO TASTE YOU KNOW IF THEY WOULD BE A DIFFERENCE OR HOW SIMILAR
LET'S GO OVER TO OUR DISH SO RIGHT BEFORE I'M ABOUT TO SERVE YOU SEE IT'S ON A NICE LOW FLAME JUST GOING TO ADD THIS FRESH PARSLEY JUST TO GIVE IT SOME TASTE
FRESH PARSLEY FOR TASTE
IT'S WHAT YOU FIND IN EVERY RESTAURANT WHERE YOU'VE TASTE THE SAUCE AND GONE HEY CAN PUT MY FINGER AND
YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO SEE IT BUT YOU'LL DEFINITELY BE ABLE TO TASTE IT
ANOTHER STEP OF WINE TASTING IS LOOKING AT A WINE FOR BUBBLES AND EVERYBODY KNOWS A SPARKLING WINE HAS BUBBLES AND THEY'RE EASY TO SEE AND THEY'RE FUN TO TASTE
YOU TASTE MOISTURE
AND AS A HOT AND TO GET A LITTLE MORE TASTE
I'LL GIVE YOU TASTE OF IT
WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I'M GOING TO TASTE CAN APART AND KIND OF MAYBE CHANGE GOES DOWN ONE OR BRING IT UP TO STAB SO WHATEVER
THAT IS THE TASTE THEM
NOW WE LIKE THE PASTE IS ALSO VERY STRONG STRAIGHT PASTE YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GO WITH ONE AND TWO TEASPOONS AND THEN TASTE IT ADD MORE IF YOU LIKE IT
SO I CAN TASTE OF NOW
BUT YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU KNOW AT THAT IT IS GOING TO TAKE OUR THE TASTE OF THE PRESSURE
NOW SOME PEOPLE IN THIS TANK ON ON SPIRITUAL BUT UP TO TELL YOU SOMETHING IF YOU PLUS YOUR FOOD AND YOU PLUS THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE YOUR FOOD TASTE BETTER AND PEOPLE ARE NICER
OUR AND I'M ONLY GOING TO PUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE BOARD BECAUSE IF YOU PUT TOO MUCH WATER IT'S GOING TO TASTE A DEAD
AND THEN ONCE YOU GET YOUR YOUR MAIN NOTE TASTE INTO WHEN YOU PLAY IN A COMPLETE CIRCLE SO THE OCEAN OR WHATEVER BREEZES CURVING GETS THE BOAT YOU FOR EVERY POSSIBLE ANGLE AND YOU TEACH YOURSELF HOW TO PLAY NO MATTER HOW MUCH WIND IS BLOWING AT YOU WHILE YOU'RE ON STAGE
YOU WANT TO WAIT UNTIL THE VERY LAST MINUTE THEN YOU WANT TO TASTE
HI MOUNTAIN TEA LIKE THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT BOLD AND AND OVER COMING IN BITTER IN THE INITIAL TASTE BUT THEN THE AFTERTASTE IS GOING TO BE SWEET
IT'S STILL GOING TO TASTE THE SAME
I'M JUST GOING TO ADD ANOTHER TWO TEASPOONS AND MIX THAT IN AND I'M GOING TO TASTE IT
SO YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST A QUESTION OF TASTE
I GREW UP IN TEXAS WATER SO I DON'T EVEN TASTE IT PUT THE BALL IS A LOT OF PEOPLE SO THEY CAN USE THE BLEACH IN THE BLEACH TABLETS ACTUALLY MAKES YOUR WATER TASTE LIKE SUPER SUPER CHLORINATED WHICH I CAN'T STAND BUT IF YOU CAN'T SAY EITHER THOSE HIS FOOT SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE DO IS THEY ACTUALLY JUST BRING GATOR A PACKETS AND THAT'LL ACTUALLY ALSO HELP YOU I KNOW REPLENISH THIS AND THE SALT STORES EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR THE DAY AND IT WILL LAST A NASTY TASTES OF THAT IDENTICALLY WHICH IS ALSO PUMPING THROUGH FILTERS BUT IT'S NOT AS THOROUGH AND YOU REALLY SHOULD USE THE IODINE TABLETS OR THE BLEACH ON TOP OF COMING IN THROUGH A FILTER
BUT THEY TASTE SO EVEN WITH THAT THE LEATHER GUYS WILL TEND TO FADE OVER TIME
I'D HAVE WHAT'S TASTE OR THE IODINE WATER AFTER YOU MAKE IT IT TASTE KIND OF LIKE A RUSTY TYPE WATER BASICALLY
I'M IS STILL PROBABLY TASTE GOOD BUT YOU NEVER KNOW
I FIND THAT WHENEVER YOU'RE MIXING IT TEQUILA WITH A JUICE REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT KIND YOU USE BECAUSE THE JUICES GOING OVER POWER MOST OF THE TASTE THE TEQUILA ANYWAYS
TONIC WATER AND CLUB SODA TASTE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT SO YOU JUST WANT TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO DO THAT
I'M GOING TO USE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT MORE AND MORE THAN NOT IT'LL IT'LL TASTE OKAY
THESE BOTH BOTH OF THESE ARE TEND TO BE USED IN MORE OF TROPICAL DRINKS OR A CARIBBEAN TYPE DRINKS AND AGAIN IF IT'S MIXED WITH A LOT OF SEVERAL OTHER INGREDIENTS YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO NOTICE THE TASTE THAT MUCH
ALRIGHT NOW AH IT'S TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHEN THE TO TAKE THE WIND WHEN IT IS IS READY TO A TO PUT IN THE BOTTLES AND AND THE AND THE POSSIBLY EVEN TAKE A TASTE AND SEE IF IT'S READY
LONG TEA IS A HIGH IT HAS THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF CALLED A FEMALE SO IT'S A VERY GOOD TEA TO DRINK FOR IF ONE FLAVOR AND TO AS THE ADDED HEALTH BENEFIT OF THESE ANTIOXIDANTS THIS TEA IS REALLY A CONDUIT FOR US TO TASTE THIS EARTH
THE SOLDER SAUCE I'VE EVEN THOUGH I GO TO IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE STRONGER IT'S LIKE TASTE IT
AND YOU'LL KNOW BY YOUR EAR IF IT'S IN TIME WITH THE B AND ALSO YOU KNOW TO YOUR OWN TASTE OF HOW YOU WANT TO MANIPULATE THE WALL EFFECT
FOR MY TASTE THE SHOULD BE A LITTLE LOWER WHICH I'LL JUST A LITTLE LATER ON
IT'S REALLY TO TASTE
AND REALLY THE ICING IS TO TASTE
SO IF YOU REALLY LIKE SUGARY YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE JUST THE SUGAR HOLLOW I CAN GO AHEAD AND TASTE
NOW THERE'S NO SET AMOUNT THAT YOU NEED TO PUT IN THERE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO THAT ACCORDING TO TASTE
SO GO AHEAD AND GRAB YOUR PEPPER AND JUST PUT A LITTLE BIT IN THERE NOT TOO MUCH WE DON'T WANT THIS TO OVERWHELM THE TASTE AND THEN DO THE SAME THING WITH THE SALT
AND WHAT I LIKE TO SAY IS NOT IN NOW BY THE TIME YOU TASTE A SAKE FROM ABOUT FROM FROM ARRIVAL TO YOUR WINE CHOPPER TO YOUR RESTAURANT IS MAYBE ANOTHER THIRTY DAYS
WITH THE OF THE COFFEE TABLE IS REALLY FINE IF FOR OF ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CONTEMPORARY PERSON YOU KNOW YOU JUST TAKE A WIRE ADD TWO TO WHAT YOUR TASTE IS
WRAP AZZATO IS THE IDEAL TO KILL YOU WANT TO USE BUT SO THE FACT IS DOESN'T REALLY MATTER AS FAR AS TASTE GOES
A ONE UP TASTE A LITTLE BIT TO GET YOUR WORK
IT DEPENDS ON YOUR TASTE
SO JUST PUT A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME AND TASTED UNTIL IT'S AT THE RIGHT TASTE THAT YOU WANT TO BE
YOU CAN TASTE THE SELLER YOU CAN TASTE THE PAIR ART
IT WON'T TASTE EXACTLY LIKE BUT IT WILL BE ENOUGH ON THE DRIBBLE STILL TASTE GOOD
FOR PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE WHOEVER YOU'RE MAKING THIS FOR WHETHER IT BE FOR YOURSELF OR FOR FAMILY OR FRIENDS ON IT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT PEOPLE BEING ON YOU KNOW LOVING FISH OR OR WHETHER THERE ARE NOT THAT BIG FISHEATERS BECAUSE THE TASTE IS VERY VERY MILD ON THE TOP YOU
I LIKE TO RINSE MY ICE SO THAT IT DOESN'T TASTE LIKE WHATEVER SPIN IN MY FREEZER FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS
NOW IN A COCKTAIL TASTE A WHOLE LOT THAT
I'M GOING TO PLAY THIS ALL TOGETHER AND SO YOU TASTE LIKE
IF THE SAUCE IN TASTE GOOD THE FIRST YOU WANT TO WAIT
SO YOU CAN SEE SOME BUBBLES BEFORE YOU TASTE THAT ONE
A LITTLE BIT OF CARBON DIOXIDE WILL MAKE A WINE TASTE FRESH AND INTERESTING AND WE'LL MOVE THEM AROUND AND WINE AROUND IN YOUR MOUTH TO ALLOW YOU TO TASTE MORE AND MORE OF IT
IF YOU EVER TASTED FLAT COKE AND I HOPE THAT WAS AN OUT AN ACCIDENT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE FLAT COKE DOESN'T TASTE GOOD AT ALL
THE LITTLE SCALLOPS OR THE AREAS THAT FOOD REST AGAINST THE TASTE OF FOR SUPPORT
WILL TASTE IT WILL GO AND WHAT'S THAT AND THAT'S IT
