SO THAT GO SWIM THESE GUN AND THERE YOU'VE GOT YOUR STOCK BLOCK
NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE SOME RICE AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A VEGETABLE STOCK
YOU DON'T CORNER SCHOOL YOU LEARN HOW TO MAKE THIS AND YOU LEARN IT BY MAKING A HUGE KIND OF YOU'LL STOCK AND MAKING A HERE AND HOW TO BROWN STOCK
SO JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU STOCK UP ON THE THINGS YOU NEED BEFORE YOU START OUT THIS LOOK AND FIND OUT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE SOMETHING
IF YOU'RE USING THE SKEW TO SMOOTH THE ITEM SMOOTH THE WORK DOWN MAKE V CUTS CUT BEADS SQUARE OFF THE END OF THE END OF THE STOCK
IN THIS SOUP I USUALLY USE A STOCK POT WHICH I'VE GONE ON THE STOVE ALREADY
IN OUR NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO SLICE THE STOCKS IN THEIR SUPPOSED TO BE SLICED AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH THICK AND NOW HERE'S A LITTLE WHEN YOU BUY ASPARAGUS SOMETIMES SOME OF ITS A LITTLE BIT WRINKLED YOU WANT TO PERFECT CUTE YOU WOULD TAKE OFF THE HARD AND AND THROW THAT AWAY AND SAVE THE STOCK AND THEN I JUST LINE THEM UP LIKE THIS TO MAKE QUICK WORK
SO WHEN YOU GET TO STEP OR START GETTING HARD TO PAINT I'M SORRY AND TALKING MY THROW THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE STOCK AND IT IS
SO I'VE GOT ALL MY CARD STOCK CUT
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SOME VEGGIE STOCK IN THIS AND ADD IT TO IT AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO ADD OUR KIDNEY BEANS OR RED BEANS WHICHEVER ONE YOU WANT TO USE
YOU'RE AIMING TO GET THE STOCKPILES MEN IN THE MIDDLE TO A A POINT WHERE YOU COULD USE YOUR STOCK PILE
HI I'M JESSICA CAIN WITH EXPERT VILLAGE STOCK
SO HERE I TOOK IS IMAGE I WENT TO A PRINT SHOP BY HAND PRINTED ON A PIECE OF SHINY CARD STOCK AND THEN I JUST BEGIN TO WAX ON TOP OF THE SURFACE
IT'S TIME TO REPLACE YOUR AIR FILTER TO IF YOU HAD THE AND THE STOCK AIR FILTER BOX IN THE CORNER JUST GOING TO BE SOME SAND IN AND WE SAY WELL WHAT HAVE YOU INSIDE OF THIS BOX
SO YOU JUST POUR THAT RIGHT IN HERE SIZZLING HOT SO YOU GOT YOUR SHRIMP STOCK YOUR INTO YOUR BUBBLING POT
OKAY NOW ONE OF OUR LAST STEPS IN THIS CRAW FISH INTO PHASE DRAG THE SHRIMP STOCK WE MADE IS HAPPY WITH WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER ALREADY COVERED WITH THE SHRIMP SHELLS THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO DO IT IF YOU HAVE IT
ONCE YOU REACH TWELVE EITHER FROM STARTING WITH THE NATURAL ONE THERE WAS A SKIP WELL THEN THE CARD PILE IS TAKEN AWAY AND THERE'S A NEW SLOT OPEN TO START A NEW STOCK PILE
I HAVE ONE CUP OF CHICKEN STOCK
OKAY SO WHILE OFF OUR VEGETABLES OVER HERE SWEATING GOING TO COME OVER HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO CUT THIS CARCASS THEN A LITTLE BIT JUST TO MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE MANAGEABLE INSIDE OF OUR STOCK POT
IT'S KIND OF OUR STOCK TRADE HAND
NOW THE OTHER THING THAT THE ROOM AND THIS MIXTURE WILL DO IS ACTUALLY ONCE WE START ADDING OUR LIQUIDS TO THIS WHETHER IT BE STOCK OR WATER IS GOING TO HELP THICKEN UP THE WHOLE DISH
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO ADD THIS TO IT AND IT'S GOING TO MELT WE'RE IN THE STOCK
PRACTICE THIS MUDRA AND YOUR PHOTO GIVEN STOCK FUNCTIONING ANOMALY
AND THIS IS A STOCK IN THE COMB OF THE SHOTGUN AND KIND OF WHAT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IS BRING THAT TO YOUR SHOULDER AND BASE SIMULTANEOUSLY
BRING THE SHOTGUN THOSE STOCK THE COMB TO THE FACE SIMULTANEOUS
IN MY CASE I DREW THE NINE OF SPACE FROM THE STOCK PILE
WHEN YOU PUT THE TWO TOGETHER YOU SHOULD BE ALMOST BE ABLE TO HAVE THE PIECE STANCE IT BY ITSELF BY THE WONDER WHAT SIXTEEN SINCE BOWL BRING UP YOUR TAIL STOCK WITH A COMB CENTER THEM AND THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO SQUARE THINGS UP
I'M AND THE CROSS SHAPE CHANNELS THE PERSPIRATION FROM YOUR FOOT RIGHT OUT OF THE ON THE STOCK AND INTO THE OUTER LAYER OF YOUR SHOE
OUR VEGETABLE STOCK IS COME TO A BOIL SO WE'RE GOING TO TURN THE HEAT ON THAT RIGHT DOWN THE TWO AND WE'RE GOING TO REMOVE IT FROM THE HEAT AND AS SOON AS IT STOPS BUBBLE AND THEN WE CAN SEE IT DURING A CHUNKS LEFT
THE THIRTY CARDS THAT WERE DEALT TO YOU OR YOUR STOCK PILE
THE GOAL OF THE GAME IS TO GET RID OF YOUR STOCKPILE BEFORE ANYONE ELSE SO WHEN YOU START YOUR TURN YOU TURN OVER THE FIRST CARD ON YOUR STOCK PILE
YOU CAN USE ANY KIND OF STRING WHICH ARE GOING TO DO IS WRAP IT AROUND YOUR FINGER RIGHT ABOVE WHERE THE RING IS STOCK
JUST PUT A LITTLE THAT ON THERE AND JUST KIND OF WORK IT AROUND THE FINGER TRIED TO GET IT UNDER THE AREA WITH A RING IS STOCK
I'M GOING TO TAKE OUR VEGETABLE STOCK AND YOU MIGHT NEED IT FOR LATER SO WE'RE GOING THAT WAY
IF YOU DRAW FROM THE STOCK YOU ADD THE CARD TO YOUR HAND WITHOUT SHOWING IT TO THE OTHER PLAYERS
THE STOCK PILE IS FACE DOWN
WE'RE GOING TO TOAST OUR RICE WE'RE GOING TO ADD OUR STOCK TO THAT BRING IT UP A TEMPERATURE FOR THAT REDUCE IT AND JUST BEFORE IT'S DONE WE'RE GOING TO BE ADDING SOME SPINACH SOME THAT ARE IN SOME CHOPPED TOMATOES
IT'S TIME WE DO A SAMPLE HAND TO MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT IT WITH RESPECT BARONESS SO IT ALL STARTS WITH THE SHUFFLE DECK WHICH WILL BECOME YOUR STOCK PILE AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUT OUT AND FIVE CARDS
FOR THIS YOU'LL NEED A CARD STOCK FOR A JUST A HEAVY PAPER YOU CAN USE
WE'RE JUST GOING TO A BOIL WE'RE GOING TO PUT ON TOP AND REDUCE OUR HEAT DOWN TO FOUR AND LET IT COOK UNTIL THE VEGETABLE STOCK IS JUST ABOUT ALL EVAPORATED
WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR VEGETABLE STOCK TO GET UP WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TURN UP OUR BACK BURNER UP TO ABOUT EIGHT
WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR THAT TO HEAT WE COME BACK TO OUR VEGETABLE STOCK
AND ONCE OUR VEGETABLE STOCK TOP IT'S GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MEASURE OUT ONE CUP AND POUR IT IN WITH OUR RICE
MUCH OF THE TIME IT'S BETTER JUST A STOCK IT YOURSELF THEN TO GO OUT AND BUY ONE THAT WAY YOU DO KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED
FIRST WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE STOCK AND KICK
BY TOUCHING THE MANDREL TO THE ELECTRODES YOU CAN GET A INJURING OR KILLING STOCK
THE THING ABOUT CHICKEN STOCK IS THE VERY NEUTRAL STOCK SO IT WILL ALWAYS TAKE ON WHATEVER FLAVOR THAT YOU END UP ADDING AND ONCE WE PUT THE FISH IN THAT CHICKEN FLAVOR WILL REALLY GO AWAY
IF YOU DON'T HAVE IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE USING CLEANED USE YOU DON'T HAVE IT OR IN FACT IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO SHELLFISH THING I WOULD USE CHICKEN STOCK NOW
I TEND TO USE A LOW SODIUM CHICKEN STOCK BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I WANT TO ADD THIS ALL BE CAREFUL MYSELF IN TERMS OF HOW THE SEASONING WORKS
OBVIOUSLY IF YOU HAVE CLAM AND YOU HAVE FISH ARE GOING TO HAVE A MORE OCEAN SWEET FLAVOR BUT THE CHICKEN STOCK REALLY IS QUITE ACCEPTABLE AS WELL
YOU STILL GOING TO USE THIS TECHNIQUE GETTING OFF THE BALL AND EVERYTHING BUT HE'S GOING TO DRAW A LINE STRAIGHT TO THAT FREE SAFETY WHICH IS CALLED STOCK BLOCKING
THE BEST TYPES OF PAPER TO USE FOR THESE ARE THE THICKER STOCK PAPERS AGAIN BECAUSE YOU'RE WORKING WITH A WET SURFACE
THE SITUATION IS THAT THE STOCK PILE IS THIN
