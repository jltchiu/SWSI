I'M USING TWO CUPS OF RICE AND THAT'S WHY I'M DOING IT SOMETIMES WHAT I DO IS I SAID A LITTLE BIT MORE SIDE JUST IN CASE AS SPILL IT OR ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENS
YOU'VE GOT PUT IT BACK IN A CASE I BUY ONES THAT HAVE
SO IN THAT CASE YOU CAN JUST NAIL IN A BROADHEAD NAIL OR JUST A STANDARD COMMON NAIL AND THAT'LL HOLD THAT
IN THIS CASE IT'S THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH SO WE WOULD COME FROM THE LINE WHERE WE WANT IT WE'RE MEASURE THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH DOWN AND THAT'S WHERE WE WERE DRIVE ARE NAIL
THAT LOOKS VERY FUNNY MAYBE I CAN DO A BETTER JOB IN TO YOUR BUT IN ANY CASE THAT'S HOW IT WORKS AND THERE WE HAVE USING SELF MADE BOOKS
IN THIS CASE IT'S WHEN THE BRAIDED ONES IT'S VERY EASY TO UNDO
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE CHANGING THE FLUID IN OUR FOUR WHEEL DRIVE TRANSFER CASE
THIS IS A ANOTHER INK NIB AND THIS WILL GIVE YOU A MUCH THICKER AND A LITTLE BIT MORE FLUID BUT THIS CASE WE DON'T REALLY HIT THAT'S THE SORT OF THE OLD FASHIONED WEIGHT
I PREFER USING OLD BOOKCASES I MEAN I'M SORRY I PREFER USING OLD BOOKS BUT A LOT MOST PEOPLE HAVE THE NEW BOOKS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE READING AND SO WHAT I DID IS I PRETTY MUCH PUT BOOKS IN THIS BOOK CASE AND THEN ONCE IN A WHILE I PUT A NEAT ASSESS THREE ARE FUN ASSESS THREE IN IT
IT'S TRYING TO LOOSEN DIRT BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I'M USING A LITTLE BIT OF A DAMP SOIL BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES WE ARE PUTTING OUR PLANTS YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE WE HAVE A LITTLE WATER IN THERE TOO
NOW IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A WHITE TEQUILA BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A WHITE TEQUILA YOU CAN USE ANY TEQUILA THAT YOU HAVE IN THIS CASE WE'VE GOT GOLD TEQUILA
IN THIS CASE THE MOSQUITO CARD EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONLY A ONE ONE CAN DEFEAT THE CRESTED CRAGG HORNS BECAUSE IT'S TOUGHNESS IS ONLY ONE
THEN YOU ALSO PROBABLY WANT TO HAVE A COOL BOWL OF COOL WATER NEXT TO IT JUST IN CASE YOU WANT TO COOL THE STONES OFF MORE RAPIDLY
WELL THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE
THE WIDTH IS IMPORTANT THE BOLSTER IS VERY IMPORTANT THE LOCKING MECHANISM ON YOUR NECK SUPPORTS VERY IMPORTANT AND YOU DEFINITELY NEED A CASE
IF YOU FEEL HEAT IN THE JOINT YOU MAY FIND THAT THE DOG WILL ALSO OBJECTIVE IT AND IN THIS CASE IS JUST DON'T DO AS MUCH OF IT JUST DO A MINUTE OR TWO SEE LITTLE TOLERATE AND THEN TRY AGAIN THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE DOING A SESSION AND GRADUALLY WORK YOUR WAY UP YOU'LL FIND THAT THIS WILL GET EASIER AS YOU'VE WORKED WITH THE ANIMAL AND THE GENERAL ENERGY IS FLOWING AND SOME OF THE STIFFNESS IS RELIEVED THEN THEY'RE GOING TO BE MORE LIKELY TO TOLERATE THIS PARTICULAR AREA BEING MASSAGE
WITH THE DOG WITH ELBOW DISPLAY YOU MAY FIND THE DOG DOESN'T LIKE THIS MASSAGE TO START WITH IN WHICH CASE YOU WANT TO START WITH JUST SOME SOFT GENTLE MOVEMENT JUST MOVE YOUR HANDS OVER THE SKIN DON'T PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON AND GRADUALLY WORK YOUR WAY UP
NOW IN THIS CASE THIS PERSON WOULD HAVE TO GIVE A THREE CARDS AND ACTUALLY BREAK UP A FLUSH THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE
IN THIS CASE IS BOARD'S GOING TO BE SEVERAL SOMEBODY WHO RIDES REGULAR AND AGAIN YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO DETERMINE YOUR STANCE BEFORE YOU CAN MOUNT THEM
USUALLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE
ANOTHER WAY WOULD BE TO ACTUALLY OPEN UP THE CASE IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW MANY RAM MODULE IS YOU HAVE
YOU CAN OPEN UP YOUR CASE AND INSPECT THAT AND SEE HOW MANY RAM MODULES IF YOU'RE LOOKING BECAUSE YOU WANT TO UPGRADE YOUR WRAP THE RAM IN OR MEMORY IN YOUR COMPUTER
YOU WANT TO GRIP THE RINGS SO THAT THE FINGER YOU'RE SPINNING ON IN MY CASE IT'S THE MIDDLE FINGER IS ALREADY IN POSITION TO ACCEPT THE RINGS
BUT IN CASE YOU'RE GONE TAB BOOKING ADVANCE THEN YOU SHOULD GO TO A TRAIN A PENDANT THEN ASK THE F TRAIN ATTENDANCE WAY TO GO ON WHAT TO DO
IF YOU WANT TO IDENTIFY YOUR CAR IT'S NOT ON THEM MAKE THE HOUSE BECAUSE IN CASE YOU BOOK YOUR TICKET THAN THE BONDS
SO IN THE CASE BECOMES VERY EXTREME THE DOG THE DOG MIGHT NEED SOME MEDICAL ATTENTION
TO BEGIN YOUR TRAIN ROUTE SIMPLY CLICK ON THE ORIGIN WHICH IS IN THIS CASE GOING TO BE A CITY AND IT'S GOING TO BE HUMID TERMINAL
IN THIS CASE WE PUT EQUAL AVERAGE WHICH IS THE NAME OF THE FORMULA WE'RE LOOKING FOR TELLING TELLING EXCEL TO TAKE THE AVERAGE OF THE NUMBERS THAT APPEAR BETWEEN THESE CELLS BECAUSE WE HAVE A TWO AND WE HAVE A COLON IN BETWEEN THAT MEANS THROUGH THE SIX SO
A LOT OF KEYBOARD IT'S A LOT OF MUSICIANS TEN TEND TO FEEL WHEN THEY'RE PLAYING IN A LIVE BAND THAT THEY NEED TO PLAY BEEP THEY NEED TO BE PLAYING ALL THE TIME AND THAT REALLY REALLY ISN'T ALWAYS THE CASE
AND THEN HIT THE G AND THEN A PINCH BETWEEN THE D IN THIS CASE WITH FRETTING WITH MAKES AN E NOTE WITH E ID AND THE OPEN B OR TO ACTUALLY I'LL BE IT'S A B C FIRST FINGER ON THE SECOND FRET ON THE A MINOR CHORD
CREATING A BITE HERE THAT'S GOING TO IN CASE MY LINE OR RED LINE WITH THAT
AND IN THIS CASE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A ROPE CLIPPED IN TO THE BACK HERE AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE DIVING OUT ATTACHED TO THE END OF THAT ROPE WITH SOMEONE STILL HOLDING THE END
SECOND OF ALL MOST DOCUMENTARIES TODAY HAVE SOME DEGREE OF NARRATION OR SOMEONE THAT YOU'RE BASICALLY GUIDES AUDIENCE THROUGH THE PRESENTATION OR HOST WHATEVER THE CASE MAYBE SOMEONE IS ACTUALLY ON CAMERA GUIDING PEOPLE THROUGH A LOT OF TIMES IT WILL BE BOTH
IN THIS CASE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A CAMPSITE THAT'S THAT'S DESIGNATED AS SITE FIVE HAVE KIND OF A NICE CLEARLY LAID OUT AREA THAT'S THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR CAMPING AND YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR CAMPING ACTIVITIES THAT WITHIN THIS AREA AND NOT GO OUTSIDE THEM
SO WE WANT TO SLICE IT VERY THINLY BECAUSE IT'S GOING IN ROCK AND WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE A TWO OVERPOWERING AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO CHEW IT OUT AS PART OF THE FEELING FOR OUR CASE TO THE OTHER
OR SOME HAIRSPRAY IN THIS CASE
ONE PARTICULAR CASE I CAN THINK OF WAS A GENTLEMAN A ABOUT SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD OF RETIRED SCHOOL TEACHER A HIS BACK AND GONE OUT
IN THIS CASE WE'RE GOING TO LIFT UP THE MIDDLE FINGER HERE AND TURN THIS F SHARP AND DO AN OPEN E STRING
CASE IN POINT ON MY PICTURE I ONLY HAD A CRAB SITTING OVER HERE ON THE LOWER PART
SO IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO MOVE HIS HEAD TO THE RIGHT
IN THIS CASE IS REALLY NOT TOO MUCH AS WE'RE USING THE LIGHT WEIGHT SPACKLE SO JUST GIVE IT A WIPE ON YOUR JEANS IT SHOULD BE FINE
IN THIS CASE WE WANT TO FIVE JUST BE SIX TO TEN AND THIS WILL BE ELEVEN THROUGH FIFTEEN
SO BOTH THE PUNCH HERE THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WE DROP STRAIGHT DOWN I JUST TAKE HIM OVER
IN THIS CASE IT'S BRINGING OUR F SHARP DOWN TO AN F NATURAL
EVEN IN A WORD THIS IS THE BEGINNING SOUND AND IN THIS CASE WE'RE BLENDING THE ENDING SOUND
THEN IN THIS CASE I LIKE TO JUST GO AHEAD AND PUT IN
IN THIS CASE RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT MY PIE RAMAT OR IN ITS INDICATING HARD TO SEE OF COURSE BUT TAKE MY WORD FOR THAT'S ABOUT NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE SEVENTY FIVE FAHRENHEIT
AND THOSE ARE REALLY BASICALLY YOUR LEFT AND RIGHT SOURCES IN THIS CASE TWO TURNTABLES
SO ONE OF THE NOSE OR WE HAVE TO GET OFF THE STAND IN THIS CASE THIS IS A PRETTY TYPICAL SAXOPHONES TO THE NECK STRAP
WE'RE GOING TO START TALKING NOW ABOUT CASE STYLES
LET'S FOCUS ON THE CASE STYLES NOW SO THAT YOU KNOW BETTER WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE LOOKING FOR ANTIQUE CLOCKS
IN THAT CASE YOU ALSO WANT TO DO THE OTHER SIDE AS WELL SO DO BOTH SHOULDER POINTS
A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO KEEP THEIR LENSES STORED IN A CASE TO PROTECT THEM INSTEAD OF LEAVING THEM ON THEIR CAMERA BODY BECAUSE THEY'RE EXPENSIVE
I TAKE THE ARMS AND I'LL FOLD THEM IN WORD AND I'VE GOT MY HAND IN THERE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO CREATE A BIG CREASE IN THERE OR I'M FOLDING I WANT TO FOLD STRAIGHT AND FLAT AND AS YOU CAN SEE I'M MAKING A LITTLE BIT HAVE OF MARGIN HERE USING HERE'S THE ARMPIT AND THIS WOULD BE YOUR SIDE OR FLANK OF THE SHIRT AND PULLING IT TOWARDS THE MIDDLE THERE AND NOW WHAT I WOULD DO IN THIS CASE WOULD BE TAKE THE TAIL BRING IT UP AGAINST MAKING SURE I'M NOT CREATING NEW CREASES I PULL IT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE COLOR TO THE COLLAR HAS SOMETHING TO PROTECT IT IT'S NOT JUST HANGING OUT THERE IN THE BREEZE BY ITSELF
AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THIS IN THIS CASE THIS IS A VERY THIN MATERIAL AND IT'S MAKING A NICE FLAT LITTLE PACKAGE AND IT COULD BE DONE JUST LIKE THIS ANOTHER WAY TO DO THIS MIGHT BE TO FOLD IT AGAIN BUT THAT WOULD BE UP TO YOU AND THE SIZE OF THE SPACE YOU HAVE IN YOUR SUITCASE
MAJOR SCALES GET UPPER CASE ROMAN NUMERALS
SO WE'RE GOING TO WRITE THAT DOWN INDICATE IT WITH A LOWER CASE ROMAN NUMERAL BECAUSE IT'S A MINOR
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I HAVE TO USE THE SAME BASIC TECHNIQUE AS I SHOWED WITH THE STAIN EARLIER THE THE OVERLAPPING CIRCLES
BUT AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY SEE WITH THIS PRODUCT IT DOESN'T HAVE A TENDENCY TO RAISE THE GRAIN AS MUCH AS THE OIL BASED STAIN AND THE NOW IN THIS CASE I DIDN'T CONDITION THE WOOD AT ALL
SO WHATEVER THE WIDTH OF YOUR BOOK CASE IS GOING TO FINELY BE THE SHELVES ARE ALWAYS AN INCH AND A HALF LESS THAN THE TOTAL WIDTH OF THE BOOK CATCH
AND AGAIN WITH THE SEVENTH A MAJOR SEVENTH TONALITY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SOUND BECAUSE THE SEVENTH IN THIS CASE WOULD BE G SHARP
IN THIS CASE YOU WOULD JUST PAINT THE EDGES ALSO
IN THIS CASE IT HAPPENS TO BE POINTING RIGHT INTO THE SUN SO IT'S PRETTY EASY TO TELL THAT
SO IN CASE YOU LIKE TO BUY A SECOND CLASS TICKETS YOU CAN SAVE MONEY ON YOUR WAY TO BELLY IN
AND IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE IN THAT CASE BUT IT WOULD BE AN EXPERIENCE WOULD WANT THE PUPPY TO HAVE
TAKE YOUR PROP IN CASE YOU NEED AND LAY IT DOWN TO STAND UP START OFF ONE
IN THIS CASE THERE'S ONLY ONE OPTION WHICH IS THE LAGOON CLASSIC
NOW IN THIS CASE AGAIN I'M JUST USING A SIMPLE PIECE OF SCRAP ONE BY
I THINK I'LL DO SOME MORE SO ANOTHER METHOD THAT I DID WAS TO TAKE A PICTURE OF THE STEPS YOU HIT A GARDEN AND THEN I COVERED THAT WITH CLEAR WAX AND IN THIS CASE I PUT DOWN SOME TISSUE PAPER AND THEN I CAN SHOW THE THREADS OF THE TISSUE PAPER THROUGH THE WAX AND COLORED ON TOP OF THAT SURFACE TO CREATE THIS EFFECT WHEN IT HITS THE HAS AN INTERESTING TRANSITION FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH TO THE WAX COATING
SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IN THAT CASE THIS TAKE THE STEM OUT OF THE VASE AND GIVE IT ANOTHER FRESH CUT SO THAT YOU'RE OPENING UP THE BASE OF THE STEM AGAIN AND IT'S DRINK OF WATER OKAY
THEY JUST TAKE THE REST OF THE NEAR OFF STAIN UP THE CASE AND YOU HAVE BASICALLY A PINE STEEPLE CLOCK WHICH MAY LOOK PRETTY BUT DEFINITELY IS NOT DESIRABLE
YOU DON'T WANT A CHILD EVER LEAVING A LOCATION IS NOT GOING LOOKING FOR YOU TO GET IT TO FLUFFED WITHOUT THE SHORE THEM THAT THAT WILL NEVER EVER BE THE CASE
WHAT I RECOMMEND IS A SINGLE ACTION REAL IN IN THE CASE OF EACH OF THESE REELS IT'S A SINGLE ACTION WHICH MEANS THAT FOR EVERY REVOLUTION OF THE SPOOL YOU BRING IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF LINE SO THAT ONE TURN LIKE THIS WILL BRING IN ABOUT NINE INCHES OF FLY LINE
BUT SOMETIMES OR NOT ENTIRELY FOR WITH THE DISTANCE OF OUR POINTS ATTACK WILL BE OR WE JUST NEED MORE DISTANCE PROTECT YOURSELF IN THAT CASE WE USE TO QUICK BUT SHORT RETREATS TO AVOID OUR OPPONENTS ATTACK
IN THIS CASE I'M GOING TO BE USING THE FINE TIPPED SHARPIE WHICH IS NO GOOD FOR THESE TYPES OF DEMONSTRATIONS CAUSE YOU CAN REALLY SEE THE INK PRETTY WELL BUT I WILL TELL YOU THE IF YOU'RE USING A SKETCH PAD THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF PRECIOUS DRAWINGS ON PROBABLY GOOD IDEA TO USE SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT LESS POWERFUL BECAUSE THIS ONE BLEED LIKE CRAZY THROUGH THE PAGES
AND IN THIS CASE WE'RE GOING TO LAY OUT A LINE OF WILL THAT'S GOING TO BECOME ARE FELTED ROPE
IF THAT'S THE CASE YOU MAY NEED TO GO TO A MORE WHAT WE CALL A VERSA TYPE COLLAR WHICH IS THIS
I HAVE ONE PIECE I LOVE USING THE CHILDRENS ART AND CRAFTS THAT THEY DIDN'T SCHOOL SO YOU'LL SEE THAT THROUGHOUT THE BOOK CASE I HAVE A FEW OF THE ART PIECES THAT MY CHILD MADE AND BRING IN THOSE FUN PIECES LIKE PIPES SPECTACLES AND JUST USE THOSE ALSO BUT MAKE YOUR BOOKCASES INTERESTING ANCHOR THEM MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE WHITE IN THEM
YOU MIGHT ALSO WANT TO HAVE A COOL TOWEL ON HAND IN CASE YOU WANNA COOL YOUR CLIENT'S SKIN OFF
THEN THERE'S A COUNTRY CODE IN THIS CASE FOR SWITZERLAND IT'S FORTY ONE
SO WE CAN SIXTEENTH NOTES ONE THE OR IN THIS CASE TO EAT AND UP SO WE HAVE TWO E AND A IN THE KICK OKAY
WHICH IN THIS CASE EACH SIDE IS ABOUT EIGHT INCHES
AND IN THIS CASE HERE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE TAIL OFF
JUST IN CASE KIND OF THING
SO IN THIS CASE RIGHT HERE WITH THIS BLUEBERRY PEACH WINE IT'S CLEAR IS NOT BUBBLING ANYMORE SO IT'S READY TO TAKE AND BOTTLE
I'M SO OFTEN CASE A SIMPLE HEAT PICTURE JUST LIKE THIS A LAMP WITH A CERAMIC TOP ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A CERAMIC TOP AND A TWENTY FIVE OR FIFTY WATT BALL USUALLY SEVENTY FIVE TOPS WILL DO YOU AS FAR AS HEATING GOES
IN THIS CASE AGAIN ONE WILL MAKE ATTACK WE'RE GOING TO HIT THE OTHER WILL EITHER YOU DO COW OUR TACKLE OR MAKE IT YOUR TAKE OVER IT
IN THIS CASE YOU SEE AS SHE'S MAKING HER ATTACK IT MAKES YOUR CUP AND A SKATE SAFELY AVOIDING THE HEAD
ANYTIME YOU HAVE COLUMNS OUT THERE AND THEY ARE THE ONLY COLUMNS REMAINING AND THE VALUE OF ALL THE COLUMNS IN THIS CASE TO IS THE SAME IN THIS CASE KING
SO IN THIS CASE OUR BAG IS ELEVEN INCHES WIDE AND WE WANT TO HAVE A LITTLE EXTRA
AND OF COURSE LIKE AN SOMETIMES THE BE THE CASE DEPENDING ON THE BLEND THE ITSELF DISTINCT DIFFERENCE BEING OF COURSE THAT A SINGLE MALT IS BLENDED FROM ONE SOURCE OF BARLEY THE ON A BLEND TO TWIST GAVE IT COMING FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MULCH WHISKEYS THEMSELVES
IN THIS CASE WE'VE GOT FOURTEEN TWENTY WHICH IS JUST RIGHT FOR THIS PARTICULAR GLAZE
SO YOU KNOW IF THAT WERE THE CASE YOU KNOW YOU CUT THIS GUY OUT AND YOU AGAIN USING YOUR MEDIA AND STICK IT DOWN MAYBE ABOVE HERE'S THE PROBLEM
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE ABLE TO USE TEXT AND WORDING THAT BECOMES A VERY BIG DEALS TO MAKE SURE AND WATCH OUT FOR THAT IN CASE YOU WANT TO TRANSFER ANY WORDS ONTO YOUR PIECE OF WOOD
IN THIS CASE IT'S GOING TO BE RIGHT THERE SO I'M GOING TO TAKE MY PIN TOOL AND SIMPLY MARKET
SO DON'T YOUR SEAT TOO HIGH FROM TRY TO RECORD REMEMBER WHAT YOUR MEASUREMENTS ARE IN CASE YOU HAVE TO MESS WITH THINGS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR SEAT NICE AND LEVEL AND GET OUT THERE AND HAVE A GOOD RIDE
YOU CAN SEE IN A CASE LIKE THIS WHERE ON AN EDGE IT'S PRETTY EASY FOR YOUR DUST CLOCK TO CATCH IN IT YOU VENEER IF IT'S STARTING TO LIFT AND POP OFF
SO IN CASE IS LIKE THAT JUST WITH THE MEAT OR SHOWER YOU WOULD NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THE CITY AND GO OUT TO THE STATE PARK
PLACE THAT ON TOP OF THE GARMENT OR OR THE FOR A PILLOW IN THIS CASE AND I'M GOING TO JUST TAKE AND WHIP STITCH
NONE OF THE SHOULDER POINTS ARE PARTICULARLY EASY SO YOU MAY END UP JUST DOING MASSAGE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE
AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE BEST WAY TO PULL IN SPONSORSHIPS YOU KNOW IT AT LEAST IN MY CASE
I'M AND THEN ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT THAT I DIDN'T EVEN WASN'T REALLY AWARE ABOUT UNTIL I BOUGHT MY TABLE THE OWNER OF THE SHOP SUGGESTED THAT I GET A CARRYING CASE WHICH I NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE
BUT CARING CASE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS BECAUSE THAT CASES GOING TO KEEP YOUR ABILITY TO MAKE A LIVING
IN THIS CASE EMMA BEGINS PREPARING HER ATTACK AND AS SHE DOES SHE IS HITTING THE HEAD
AND JUST HAVE A GOOD OR SWEET CASE TO THIS WITH THE GRAPEFRUIT JUICE BUT WITH THE HEEL IS GOING TO HAVE A NICE BIG CONTROL OVER THE BITTERNESS OF THAT GRAPEFRUIT JUICE
THIS SHOWS IN CASE THE EMERGENCY YOUR PROPERLY TRAINED TO ASSIST THEIR CHILD
IF YOU DON'T PUT ENOUGH AIR INTO IT YOU KNOW YOUR CASE AND FIRE RADICALLY NOT WHAT YOU WANT
IN THIS CASE WE'RE GOING TO USE THE SECOND FRET OF THE A STRING THE FOURTH FRET A WE WOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT MIDDLE ONE BECAUSE IT'S AN OCTAVE
SO THEN THE ACCIDENTAL ON THE F SHARP WOULD NORMALLY MAKE THIS AN F SHARP BUT SINCE WE DON'T IN THIS CASE WE DON'T WANT THAT TO BE SHARP WE HAVE TO USE THE NATURAL SIGN TO REALLY BE REDUCED THIS BACK TO REGULAR F SO WE HAVE F F SHARP F NATURAL
SO IN THIS CASE WHAT I'M AFTER IS A P THAT I WANT TO PUT RIGHT HERE SO THAT I END UP WITH PLACING AND SPACING
IT GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF AND THEN I WANT HER WHERE THAT LITTLE THOUGHT TAKES ME IN THIS CASE IF YOU'VE GOT ME THINKING ABOUT HOW CAN I MULTIPLY THE TOOLS THAT I HAVE TO MAKE MANY MORE TOOLS OUT OF THE ONE TOOL
THIS TERMINAL MIGHT STAY CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IF YOU DON'T BEND IT OUT OF THE WAY A LITTLE IN WHICH CASE WE MIGHT STILL HAVE THE SPARKING PROBLEM
IN THIS CASE WE WE COULD BE PLAYING THE SAME STRINGS
SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO GRAB THESE ALL THESE ARE GOLF CHOOSE ACTUALLY THERE'S NOT THEY'RE NOT PAY MOTION BUT YOU CAN REPLACE ALL THESE LITTLE SPIKES SO IN CASE TO WEAR OUT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT WILL FIT PERFECTLY
ONE THING I WOULD SUGGEST DOING THE UNLESS YOU JUST AN ENGINE FANATIC MAKE THE ENGINE PORTION WHICH USUALLY RESTS UNDERNEATH THE SEAT MAKE IT AS VEGAN AMBIGUOUS AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN DO IS YOU DO NOT WANT UNLESS OF COURSE YOU'RE TRYING TO DESIGN THE LOOK OF AN ENGINE IN WHICH CASE I SAY GO NUTS BUT UNLESS THAT'S YOUR GOOD DIRECTIVE DO NOT GOING TO MUCH DETAIL OF THAT CAUSE THAT'S PEOPLE WILL BE SO DISTRACTED BY WHAT IT IS THE ONE EVEN KNOW WHAT TO LOOK AT HONESTLY THEY'LL BE JUST VERY VERY CONFUSE BUY IT
BUT IT GETS THAT TEMPERATURE HIGH ENOUGH AND IN THE CASE OF THE THAT FAT TRAY ITALIAN THAT'S WE'RE USING NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT GETS THE GLASS HOT ENOUGH SO THAT THE MOLECULES IN THE BEAD FORM GET TO VIBRATE AND KIND OF MOVE A LITTLE BIT
NOW MAYBE THAT'S NOT AS COMMON THESE DAYS BECAUSE THE NUMBER CAMCORDERS AROUND BUT YOU CAN GO INTO YOUR MENU GO DOWN IN THIS CASE TO RECORD LAMP AND CHANGE THE STATE OF THAT TO OFF AND WILL CHANGE IT BACK TO ON AND SO THAT WAY YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND RECORD WITHOUT PEOPLE KNOWING IF YOU ARE OR ARE NOT
IN MY CASE I DREW THE NINE OF SPACE FROM THE STOCK PILE
THE OTHER BIG GIVES YOU THE TEXT IT GOES IN CASE YOU'RE PLAYING ON THAT AND YOU ALL THE RIBS GETTING REALLY BAD YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE IT OUT AND THEN HAVE YOU IT ON THE GROUP THERE I'M READY TO PLAY AGAIN WE ON
ONE OTHER THING WE CAN DO IS THE TRIM ON THE BACK WHERE THAT BASE WAS A A PLUGGED INTO GO AHEAD AND JUST BRING THAT BACK DOWN TO A TO ENOUGH AND JUST IN CASE WHEN YOU GO TO DO SOMETHING ELSE LATER YOU DON'T HAVE A HIGH LEVEL ON DAMAGE OR YEARS OR SOMETHING
SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT I'VE USED OUR THE TRADITIONAL TEXTBOOKS OF COURSE AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE STANDARDS TO HELP GUIDE THE CURRICULUM ESPECIALLY IF A CURRICULUM IS NOT SET WHICH IS THE CASE AND A LOT OF THE CHARGER SCHOOLS THAT I SEE
IN THIS CASE THIS IS HALF WE'RE GOING TO BE BENDING UP A HALF STEP

NOW A LOT OF TIMES WHAT PEOPLE WILL DO IS THEY'LL PUT A LOT OF LITTLE ASSESS CERISE IN A BOOK CASE WHICH REALLY GETS LOST AND SO YOU REALLY NEED IF YOU'RE GOING TO DECORATE WITH A SET OF THREE'S YOU NEED TO DO ONE BIG PIECE SO WE HAVE BOOKS AND ONE BIG PIECE
A CASE INVOLVING AND GARLIC IS THE KEY WITNESS
