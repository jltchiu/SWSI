THE KING SHOULD FIT TO SQUARE IS WHEN YOU LAY HIM DOWN OR A ROCK ONE SQUARE WHEN YOU LAY HIM DOWN
I MEAN CHANCES ARE THE OPPONENTS THE ONLY WAY THAT THIS BUILD THIS BID WOULD BE SET WITH THIS ACES THAT ONE UPON WOULD HAVE TO HAVE KING QUEEN JACK TEN OR SOMETHING OF THAT IT'LL
THAT'S THE ONLY REQUIREMENT FOR YOUR MATTRESS THAT IT HAS A CENTER SUPPORT ON A QUEEN IN A KING SIZE MATCHES
BUT THE THING ABOUT A LOT OF THE UNIQUE CHESS SETS IS THAT THEY HAVE UNUSUAL PIECES SUCH AS THIS IS THE KING
THAT'S THE FIRST PORTION OF KING YOU WANT
THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO NOW IS CASH THE ACE OF DIAMONDS CARES THE KING OF SPADES PLAY THE THREE OF HEARTS AND SAY THAT'S IT
BUT IN GENERAL YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A STAUNTON THAT THREE SEVEN FIVE FOUR INCHES TALL FOR THE KING
THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO SMALLER SPADES WITH IT IS VERY ENCOURAGING BECAUSE EITHER YOUR PARTNER COULD HAVE THE JACK QUEEN KING OR ACE OF SPADES WHICH IS ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT PROBABILITY
IF THE ACE OF CLUBS IS OVER HERE IN THE KING IS GOING TO GET SWALLOWED UP
STAUNTON HERE IS STILL THE SET THAT YOU'RE USED TO WITH THE STYLIZED FORM AND ACROSS FROM THE TOP FROM THE KING
IF THE ACE OF CLUBS IS IN YOUR PARTNER'S HAND THIS IS THE KEY CARD HERE THEN YOUR KING A WALK THROUGH
BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT THE LEAD COMES THROUGH HERE YOU'LL GET YOUR KING IN
ANYTIME YOU HAVE COLUMNS OUT THERE AND THEY ARE THE ONLY COLUMNS REMAINING AND THE VALUE OF ALL THE COLUMNS IN THIS CASE TO IS THE SAME IN THIS CASE KING
IN THIS BED BETTING ROUND THE PLAY WITH THE KING AND START THE BETTING ROUND
AGAIN THE BETTING I STARTED BY THE PLAY WITH THE HIGHEST CARD SHOWING THIS BE IN THE KING
MY NAME IS DANIEL KING
BECAUSE THE KING PLAYS ON AN ACE BUT THE ACES ARE LOCKED UP BEHIND THE KINGS
ACE KING OF HEARTS LOOK PRETTY GOOD FOR TWO TRICKS ACE KING OF CLUBS LOOK PRETTY GOOD FOR TWO TRICKS AND THE ACE OF SPADES IS DEFINITELY ONE TRICK
AND YOU CAN SEE SHE SHE ACTUALLY REPRODUCED THIS FIRE KING AND BECAME VERY POPULAR SO IT RAISES THE PRICE ON THESE ITEMS WHEN WHEN THEY BECOME MORE IN DEMAND
SO ANOTHER THING THAT COMES TO MINE IS A FIRE KING WHICH IS A GREEN DINNERWARE PRODUCED IN THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS THAT I LIKE THIS TO IT SHOWS ALL THE TIME
WELL AN EIGHT LOW CAN WIN SO I SAY KEEP THE EIGHT AND THROW AWAY THE KING IS YOU'RE GOING TO ASK FOR ONE CARD SO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE
KING SHOES CAN LOOK A LITTLE RIDICULOUS AFTER ALL
WHEN CHOOSING THE TRUCKS ALL THE TRUCKS ARE GENERALLY THE SAME EXCEPT FOR YOU HAVE YOUR ALLEN KEY KINGPIN AND THEN YOU HAVE YOUR RATCHET KING PIN
WHEN YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME TO GIVE YOUR KING WHATEVER KIND OF SHOES YOU FEEL YOU SHOULD BE WEARING
BUT IN MY WORLD THIS KING YOU LOOKS YOU KNOW ATTACHING THAT WOULD BE WEARING SHOES LIKE THAT
AND TO ME JUST USE A THIS KING IS A TYPE OF KING THAT WOULD LIKE TO WEAR REALLY JUST SILLY SHOES WITH REALLY RIDICULOUS LITTLE FLAPS LIKE THIS
MY NAME IS DANIEL KING
WE'RE BUSTED BECAUSE WE'RE DOWN TO A KING IN A KING
BUT I THIS KING OF FOR WHATEVER REASON WHEN YOU'RE DRAWING A YOU KNOW A CHARACTER ANY CHARACTER IS SORT OF HAVE TO BE TRUE THE CHARACTER THAT YOU START WITH
ALL OF THAT THIS IS SORT OF A UNIQUE LOOK FOR A KING AND IF WE WANT IT TO A GIVEN HIM BOOTS ARE WE GOING TO GIVE THEM A YOU KNOW ANYTHING REALLY
THE HEIGHT OF THE SET IS JUDGED BY HOW TALL THE KING IS
SET TO USUALLY DOG WOULD AND STAUNTON STYLE WHICH IS THE CLASSIC STYLE HERE WITH US STYLIZED BODY AND ACROSS ON THE TOP FOR THE KING
MY NAME IS DANIEL KING
BIG JOKER LITTLE JOKER ACE KING QUEEN AND SO FORTH
IT IS VERY LIKELY THIS KING WOULD HAVE QUITE NICE SHOES I'M SURE WILL DRAW HIS ANKLE IS COMING DOWN LIKE SO
IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO DRAWING SOME FEET ARE KING AND IF YOU WANT TO GET HIS GAP IS HERE EVENTUALLY GOING TO BE DRAWING IS QUEEN SENDING NEXT ONE BUT FOR NOW HE'S BY ITSELF
