SO YOU'LL NEED TO TAPE OR PIN THE EDGES OF NINETY PEN AND PAPER
IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW A DOOR HANDLE WORKS I DON'T RECOMMEND IT BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE THIS GREAT TAPE CALLED PAINTERS TAPE AND YOU SIMPLY WRAP IT AROUND THERE AND AND PROTECT THE HANDLE
AND THAT'S THE NEXT THING I DO IS I THEN REMOVE THE REELS CAREFULLY SO IS TO NOT TOUCH THE TAPE
HOW I APPLY MY PATTERNS IS IS AFTER I SKETCH OUT MY PATTERN AND GET IT IS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE TO WHAT I HAVE I WANT ONE I HAVE A IT'S A SPRAY ADHESIVE IT'S LIKE LIQUID SCOTCH TAPE IT'S IN THE CAN
USING A PIECE OF MASKING TAPE WE THEN RIGHT OUT THE SPECIES NAME AND THE DATE THAT THEY HATCHED IT AND THEN APPLY THAT TO THE CONTAINER
SO WE GOT OUR BOTTOMS CHOPPED HERE WITH THE TAPE TO FINISH CUTTING THE I'M SORRY THE TOPS ARE DONE HERE WE'RE GOING TO FINISH OFF IN THE BOTTOMS OF THE REST OF THE BROWN AND WE'LL SEE YOU BACK AT THE NEXT STEP
SO I'M GOING TO APPLY THIS BASE PAINT OVER IT OVER THE MASKING TAPE AND THAT WILL HELP ME PLACE A NICE EVEN COAT OF COLORED PAINT ALONG THE PICTURE FRAME
THINGS LIKE TRIMMING THE WHEELS REDOING BAR TAPE AND REDOING CABLES KIND OF SOMETHING THAT A BIKE STORY IS REALLY GOOD THAT HAS THE NECESSARY TO ROLLS AND KNOW HOW TO DO THAT
NOW WHEN STARTING A PART OF THE BEST WAY TO LEARN IS BY TAPING ONLINE OF MASKING TAPE ACROSS THE FLOOR THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING
ONCE YOU HAVE THAT MASKING TAPE SET YOU CAN PUT YOUR TOE ON THE LINE TO START
OKAY THE NEXT STEP I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PUT THE COPPER FOIL TAPE ON TO THE PATTERN PIECE AND GO TO THE NEXT STEP FROM
I LIKE THE WOOD ONES FOR WE'RE GOING TO USE THAT FOR A BALANCE WOBBLE CORRECTION TAPE MEASURE FOR CEILING HEIGHT
BUT I THINK ANYTHING YOU DO OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM YOU CAN BRING INTO THE CLASSROOM AND SOMEWHERE ANOTHER BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WE'RE TAPE THAT WE'RE TEACHING THE BASICS OF LIFE EVERYDAY IN THE ELEMENTARY H STUDENT
IF YOU DO PAINT ON TAPE BE SURE YOU LAP UP OVER TO NOT UNDERNEATH YOUR ROLL UP UNDERNEATH THE PAINT
THEY'RE ON THE PROBLEM WITH TAPE THOUGH IS TO KIND OF TAKE IT ALL DOWN WHEN YOU'RE DONE
ONCE YOU REALLY LEARN HOW TO CUT A LINE YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF TIME IF YOU DON'T NEED TO USE THE TAPE
THE REASON WHY NEEDED IS BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE PUTTING SOME GOLD METAL FASTENERS INTO THE CARDBOARD TO HELP WE FASTEN THE BACK OF THE PICTURE FRAME AND THEN I'M GOING TO COVER IT WITH MASKING TAPE
AND I'LL NEED SOME MASKING TAPE
THAT AWESOME CYCLES FROM NATURE THE TAPE
SO ONCE WE'VE SET OURSELVES WE'RE GOING TO RAISE OUR RIGHT HAND OR LEFT HAND WHICH EVER IS GOING TO BE YOUR FIRST HIT THE FLOOR YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE IT LANDS ON THE TAPE ONE HAND TO HAND FOOT FOOT
SO WE'LL MAKE A MARK AT TEN INCHES WITH OUR TAPE MEASURE
NOW LET'S START PUTTING THE TAPE ACROSS THE BOOK
I CHOSE MY FRIEND TAPE
I'M FROM THE FIRST PLACE I'M GOING TO PUT THE TAPE IS GOING TO BE ACROSS THE TOP HERE
I'M GOING TO COVER THE FASTENERS OF MASKING TAPE AND NOW I DON'T WANT THEM TO SHOW THROUGH WHEN DECORATING THE PICTURE FRAME
SO IN ORDER TO GET THE PROPER DEPTH YOU WANT TO MEASURE THE DIAMETER OF THE BOWL AND FOR THIS I'VE GOT A TAPE MEASURE AND IT'S ABOUT AND NINE AND A HALF INCH DEPTH OUR PALM OUTSIDE DIAMETER AND THEN WE WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT OUR DEPTH THIS AND FOR THAT WE USE A RULER ON THE VERY BACK OF THE BOWL AND THEN PUT A TAPE MEASURE FLAT UP AGAINST IT AND THAT TELLS US WE HAVE ROUGHLY ABOUT TWO TWO AND THREE QUARTERS OF DEPTH
THEY'LL LISTEN TO A SONG OFF THE WORK TAPE OR THE DEMO THAT THAT YOU'VE BROUGHT IN READ THE CHART DOWN TALK ABOUT A CHANGES THAT THEY MIGHT WANT TO MAKE
THE BEST WAY TO MEASURE SEAT HEIGHT IS THE TAPE MEASURE MEASURING EIGHT CONSISTENTLY FROM THE CENTER OF THE BOTTOM BRACKET WHICH IS THAT BOLT RIGHT THERE TO THE CENTER OF THE SEAT TUBE
SO YOU REALLY WANT TO PAINT TO ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH AWAY FROM YOUR TAPE LINE AND THEN FINISH THAT FAR WITH THE BRUSH
WHAT THEY DO IS WHEN YOU'RE PAINTING WITH THE ROLLER IS IT'S INTONATION DID GOAL IN PAIN ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TAPE LINE WHEN YOU'RE REALLY SHOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THE MORE PAINT YOU PUT ON THE TAPE YOU CREATE A SEAL SO THAT WHEN YOU PULL THE TAPE BACK YOU WIND UP PULLING THE PAINT AND MESSING UP A LOT OF GOOD WORK
FIRST WE'RE GOING TO NEED A PENCIL AND TAPE MEASURE TO HELP US DO ALL THE MEASURING IN MARKING IN DESIGNING A DRAWING UP OUR PROJECT
IT OUT THERE AND IT ALSO HAS THESE GREAT LIKE STICKY TAPE ON THE BOTTOM
I JUST LIGHT AND VERY GENTLY SO IT DOESN'T RIP THE TAPE
SO AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE BIDDING YOUR HAND THE TRICKS THAT YOU EXPECTED TAPE
AS IT GETS TALLER YOU MAY WANT TO DUCT TAPE YOUR OLD MAGAZINES ARE BOOKS TOGETHER JUST MAKE SURE THAT IT'S REAL STABLE BECAUSE THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS FOR YOUR CAT JUST HAVE THE LITTER BOX SLIDE ANYWHERE FALL
SO AFTER I AS I'M ESTABLISH THE BORDER WITH MY PAINTERS TAPE AROUND THE AREA AND TO COLLAGE
NOW THE TRICK TO USE A TAPE IS YOU NEED TO BRUSH OFF THE TAPE AND NOT LET THE BRUSH ROLL UNDERNEATH IT
SO FOR THE WINDOW WE'VE ALREADY DRAWN THE WINDOW PERIMETER AND NOW I'M GOING TO LAY DOWN STICKY TAPE ALONG WINDOW PERIMETER
SO THERE WE HAVE THE TAPE
THE KEY TO GOOD TAPING IT IS TO LET THE TAPE RELAXES IT HITS THE CLOTH
JUST PUT A SMALL PIECE OF SCOTCH TAPE DOWN IN THE POSITION AND YOU TAKE IT TO THE MACHINE AND JUST LINE IT UP RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE FOOT IN
NOW THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DO IS WELL LIKE RADIAN HEAT PANELS OR A HEAT TAPE HEAT CHORD THINGS LIKE THAT
WHICH IS FIRE IT UP AND READY TO GO BECAUSE I'M GOING TO NEED IT LATER ON TO USE WITH THE FUSIBLE A TAPE
TAKE THE GUITAR INDICATOR MOVE THAT UP TO THE TAPE MODE
HOW TO TAPE IS ACTUALLY INTO THE THREE DIFFERENT STRIPS AND THAT WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO OPEN IT UP AND WE CAN FOLD IT DOWN
DON'T PUT IT EXACTLY ON THE END BUT WE NEED TO LEAVE IT OVER A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HALF THE WIDTH OF THE TAPE AND THAT IS GOING TO BE TUCKED IN INTO THE BOTTOM AND GIVE MORE SUPPORT YOU WON'T BE IT AND YOU WON'T YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE YOU
WE'RE GOING TO TUCK IT INTO THE SPINE AND THAT'LL PREVENTS THE TAPE IF WE PUT A RIGHT TO THE TOP
WE TAKE OUR TAPE AND THAT WILL NEED TO ABOUT A HALF INCHES
SOMETIMES THE TAPE STARTS TO COME OFF AND GET STICKY
IF THEY DON'T STICK ORIGINALLY WITH THE GLUE CAN ALWAYS TAKE A SMALL PIECE OF MASKING TAPE OR SCOTCH TAPE TO HOLD THEM DOWN AND THAT SHOULD HOLD THEM IN PLACE UNTIL THEY'RE DRY
IN USING TAPE AND A COMPUTER TOGETHER BECAUSE I THINK YOU GET THE BEST BOTH ROLLED ROLLS THIS WAY A TIME CODE WILL SINK UP YOUR TAPE WITH YOUR PRO TOOLS AND THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE EXPERT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO BOOK A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR IN OUR ROOM TO DO IT BUT IF YOU RECORD YOUR DRUMS AND BASE TO TAPE SINK THAT UP AND THEN PLAY GUITAR IS A TO YOUR VOCALS DIGITALLY YOU REALLY DO HAVE THE MARRIAGE OF GETTING THAT THE CERTAIN LOW IN REPRESENTATION OF TAPE IS IN THE WALK TO THE DEPTH OF THE GIVES THAT RANGE AND STILL HAVEN'T EASE OF EDITING AND AND TUNING AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS AT EASE OF OPERATION THE QUICKNESS THAT OF RECORDING THE DISTILLATE ROUND GIVES YOU
THERE'S A CERTAIN DEPTH THAT YOU CAN GET WITH TAPE THAT IS JUST IN THE HAIR IN IT
TAPE ON THE OTHER HAND USUALLY COLORS IT BUT IN A VERY PLEASING WAY ADD SOME NOISE FLOOR JUST A LITTLE HERE THIS KIND OF SETS THE EAR AS TO WHAT VOLUME TO EXPECT
IT'S A GREAT PLATFORM FOR MOST OF LUGGING A THOUSAND PALETTE TAPE MACHINE AROUND REALLY PORTABLE
NOT TO SAY THAT I DON'T LIKE TAPE THIS TAPE IS ANY AUDIO ENGINEERS GOD BUT THE DIGITAL FORM DIGITAL ROUND IS BECOMING MUCH MORE EFFICIENT A LOT CLEANER LOP DID YOU KNOW THE FREQUENCY RANGE IS CHANGING SO THAT WE HAVE HIGH RESOLUTION IT'S JUST LIKE YOU HAVE A STEEP CAMERAS YOU HAVE A STEEP MUSIC
CERTAIN WAYS IT'S BETTER THAN TAPE
OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE JUST FLIP YOU HAVE TO FLIP THE TAPES OVER SO THIS TAPE NOTE GOES OVER HERE AND THIS ONE COMES OVER HERE
THIS ONE'S NOW IN OVER HERE AND THEN DO THE REVERSE BY JUST POP IT I'M IN MAKING SURE THEY LOCK IN PLACE AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT THE TAPE SURE NO INTO PLACE WHERE YOU CAN LOCK THEM BACK DOWN
LOCK THEM BACK DOWN FROM THE HUB AND THEN TIGHTEN THE TAPE TIGHTEN THE TAPE UP ONTO THE REAL LIKE SO
WHAT I GENERALLY DO IS AGAIN FROM THERE JUST A IT PLAY FROM WHEREVER YOU CUT IT OFF THE IN THE LAST TRACK GIVE IT A GOOD YOU KNOW FIVE TO TEN SECONDS HIT STOP AND WE CAN ZERO IT OUT AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE A YOUR DIFFERENT PULLING THE TAPE BUT YOU CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND THE START RECORDING OTHER SONG
I WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE BALL IN THE CORNER POCKET WHICH I WOULD MAKE A AND THEN I WOULD HAVE MYSELF IN A POSITION YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TRY TO PLAY POSITION IT'S ANOTHER VIDEO TAPE FOLKS GOOD I PUT MYSELF IN SUCH A POSITION THAT I COULD PLAY THE OF THE TIME BALL IN THIS CORNER AND MAKE MY CUE BALL COME OUT FOR A GOOD POSITIONING SHOT FOR THE EIGHT BALL AND WINNING THE GAME
WE CAN GET AWAY WITH WITHOUT THAT RIGID TAPE MEASURE WITHOUT THE POWER SCREWDRIVER AND THESE WOULD BE THE MINIMUM TOOLS WE NEED
JUST GO AHEAD AND REWIND THE TAPE AND GET READY TO A TO PLAY IT BACK IN THE SEE HOW IT SOUNDS WITH THE RHYTHM GUITAR TRACK
TAKE A LOOK AT HOW MANY BREAKDOWN SHEETS OF TAPE
ALSO YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE A TAPE MEASURE OR A RULER TO SPACE THE PLANTS EXACTLY EVENLY APART
SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO HOW WE CAN GO AHEAD AND REMOVE THE TAPE SINCE WE KNOW THIS OIL IN THE ENGINE AGAIN IT AND WE'RE GOING TO START THE VEHICLE AND LET IT RUN MAYBE TWENTY THIRTY SECONDS IS ENOUGH TIME AND ALLOW THE OIL FILTER TO FILL UP COMPLETELY WITH OIL
LATER ASKED TAPE OVER TOP OF THE PIECE ATTACKING TAPE IT RIGHT DOWN THE SIDE OVER HERE TO MAKE SURE IT'S NICE AND SMOOTH
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO APPLY YOUR AS TAPE
HOPEFULLY THE MEASURING TAPE WILL HELP YOU OUT
DON'T TOUCH IT DON'T PUT YOUR FINGER PRINTS ON THERE THAT WILL RUIN THE TAPE
LET'S CONTINUE NOW WITH OUR SESSIONS ON HOW TO USE A TWO TRACK REEL TO REEL TAPE RECORDER
NEXT THING I DO IS I LOOSEN UP THE TAPE
DON'T TOUCH THE TAPE
A PAIR OF SCISSORS SOME ACCENT PENS AND A LITTLE BIT OF DOUBLE STICK TAPE OR A DAB OF GLUE
THE OTHER THING YOU WOULD NEED IS VERY IMPORTANT IS THE FLORAL TAPE WHICH IS A TAPE AND YOU COULD BUY ANY CRAFT STORE AND AS YOU'RE ALL WORKS IS GIVING A LITTLE TUG AND IT HOLDS IT ALL YOUR CONSTRUCTION IN YOUR FLOWERS TOGETHER AS YOU'RE WORKING WITH IT
YOU WANT TO POP VINYL AND NOT WHOLE LONG TAPE BECAUSE THE VINYL WILL STRETCH AND THEN SHRINK IS IT HITS THE CLOTH AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THE WRINKLY WINDOW
ON THE CLAW OFFSIDE GETTING THE SCISSORS RIGHT NEXT TO THE TAPE WILL HELP PREVENT FRAMING
IF YOU TRIM CLOCKWISE AROUND YOU CAN GET THE SCISSOR EDGE RIGHT NEXT TO THE TAPE
I'VE HEARD PEOPLE ARE PENGUIN DUCT TAPE AND ACTUALLY LASTED FOR AWHILE LIKE I THINK YOU CAN DO THAT IF YOU'RE ON A TRACK YOU NEED A QUICK FIX YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING WITH YOU BUT WHAT I FOUND BEST TO WHERE IT IS ACTUALLY A POP SEE
YOU WANT TO GO ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK OBVIOUSLY BUT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY PUTS A PLAYER PAINTS ALONG THE OUTER EDGES WHICH ARE WHICH WERE COVERED WITH MASKING TAPE
IT'S IMPORTANT TO GO AROUND THE SIDES TO WHERE WE PUT THE MASKING TAPE
NOT SWORD ABOUT THE THE TEXTURE UNDERNEATH OF THE MASKING TAPE AND THE WHITE BASE PAINT WHICH ALSO WHEN I'M KIND OF THICK BECAUSE THE TEXTURE IS KIND OF A KIND OF LIKE HAVING THE LITTLE BIT OF TEXTURE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PICTURE FRAME
YOU NEED PACKING TAPE YOUR ACETATE AND NEWSPRINT
BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE TAPE
THE MEASURING A SOFT MEASURING TAPE IS YOUR GREATEST TOOL FOR MEASURING
THE BACTERIA LIVE OFF OF PLAQUE WHICH IS A COMBINATION OF OF BACTERIA IN FOOD SOURCE AND GELATINOUS MASS STICKS TO THE TAPE
