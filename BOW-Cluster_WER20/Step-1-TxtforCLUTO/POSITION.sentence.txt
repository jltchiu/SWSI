I COULD JUST KIND OF LEAN INTO THIS GIVE MYSELF A NICE KIND OF PLANK PUSH UP POSITION MAYBE GET MYSELF SOME TRICEP PUSHES EACH
SO AS THIS HAND COMES OUT FROM THIS POSITION THE HANDS GO OPEN HEAD TURNS FORWARD AND PALMS ARE UP
THE REAR HAND OR LEFT HAND IS DOWN BY THE RIBS BLOCKING AND THIS IS AN A STANDING PUNCH POSITION SO FIST IS STANDING UP
SO I'M GOING TO JOIN ONICA AND POSITION SIX AND WE'RE GOING TO DO MIRROR IMAGING FOR YOU
FROM POSITION SIX WHICH IS A CLOSE TIP POSITION WE CAN GO RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS SUN SO THAT TO A BALANCING POSE JUST ARE FUN
THIS EXERCISE IS CALLED THE SIDE PLANK AND THIS IS A GREAT EXERCISE THAT WE'VE ADOPTED FROM YOGA SO WE'RE GOING TO INCORPORATE THE CORE AND WE'RE GOING TO WORK OUT OF BALANCE STABILITY STRENGTH ALL THAT GREAT STUFF THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IS NICE AND TALL IN OUR POSTURE SO YOU WANT TO COME TO YOUR STAIRS AND JUST PLACE YOUR HAND ON ONE OF THE STEPS AND KIND OF WALK YOUR FEET OUT AND YOU WANT TO LIFT THROUGH YOUR TORSO HERE EXTEND YOUR TOP ARM UP TOWARDS THE CEILING AND JUST HOLD THIS POSITION AND YOU CAN HOLD THIS POSITION FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS TO A MINUTE
WHAT YOU DON'T WANT IS A ROUNDED POSITION FOR THE SPINE TO GET OUT OF SO THAT YOU RUN THE RISK OF INJURING THE LOWER BACK
YOU CAN INCREASE YOUR HEART RATE AND IS IT THAT ELEVATED POSITION FOR A GOOD HALF HOUR TO FORTY FIVE MINUTES AND I NEED TO BRING IT BACK DOWN SLOWLY
FROM THIS POSITION EVERY TIME YOU TAKE A BREATH IN AND REMEMBER THAT THREE PART BREATH BREATHING FROM THE BELLY ALL THE WAY UP TO THE COLLAR BONES ON THE INHALE THAT'S GOING TO LENGTHEN YOU FROM THE TAIL BONE ALL THE WAY UP TO THE CROWN OF THE HEAD
MOVING OUR HAND BACK DOWN AND HALF POSITION ON THE A STRING LET'S LEARN THIS B FLAT MAJOR SCALE SO STARTING WITH THE FIRST FINGER ON THE A STRING IS B FLAT AND SEE THE FOURTH FINGER OPEN D E FLAT AND THEN F SO NOTICE YOUR HAND DOESN'T CHANGE POSITION IT OFF AND YOU JUST HAVE THAT OPEN STRING IN THE MIDDLE B FLAT C D E F KEEP YOUR FINGERS DOWN WHEN YOU'RE USING THEM KEEPING CLOSE WHEN YOU'RE NOT USING THEM
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INTERMEDIATE FLOOR GYMNASTICS AND WE'VE COVERED ARE STRETCHING IN OUR WARM UPS TO AVOID INJURY AND THE NEXT THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WAS WAS YOUR YOUR BODY POSITIONS ARM MAINLY YOUR HEAD POSITION
SO I JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU SOME OF THE BASIC SKILLS AND WHERE YOUR HEAD POSITION IS ON THOSE SCALES
IT SHOULD STAY IN THAT KIND OF TUCK POSITION THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH
THE FOR YOUR HAND CENTER WHAT YOU'LL KICK UP AND STAY DOWN IN THAT SAME TUCK POSITION
DOUBLE WRIST GRAB THE CHIN STRUGGLE GUY CAN GET AWAY BOOM SUPPLIES AND COME IN WITH THAT BUT BREAK HIS NOSE USE CRUTCHLEY GROWING GO DOWN DROP YOUR WEIGHT BRING UP RIGHT HERE GRAB UNDERNEATH SOME OF THE BACK OF THE HIM FOREFINGERS HERE FOR POWER AND THEY'RE GOING TO ROLL OR GRABS UP TO YOU ON TOP STEP BACK WITH YOUR LAWFUL LEG FOR POWER IN A CIRCLE BOOM HE'S RIGHT THERE I CAN A BROKEN ADDRESS RIGHT HERE AND IT'S CHILL POSITION THE DROP SOME PUNCHES
THEY'RE GOING TO GO SLOW AND I'LL SHOW YOU COVER THEM OVER THEM A LITTLE BIT ME ON SIDE POSITION YOU CAN FINISH WITH PUNCH
KEEP YOUR SPINE IN NEUTRAL POSITION BY ENGAGING YOUR ABDOMINAL MUSCLES
AS FAR AS THE BAR CHORDS WE'RE GOING TO DO THE SAME POSITION AS WE DID IN THE PREVIOUS WITH A IN A SHARP FIRST FINGER SEVENTH FRET WHICH IS BE THIRD FINGER NINTH FRET FOURTH FINGER ALSO NINTH FRET AND THEN THEY'LL YOUR MIDDLE FINGER OF COURSE ON THE EIGHTH FRET
I'M SHOWING THIS ON THE DIFFERENT POSITION
YOU GET YOURSELF SET UP FIRST INTO A LUNGE POSITION
THIS POSITION IS CALLED OUR CHAMBER POSITION
STARTING POSITION YOU'RE GOING TO ROLL ALL FOUR FINGERS IN AND BRING YOUR THUMBS OVER YOUR INDEX AND MIDDLE FINGER PLACING YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HIP BONE
THIS IS GOING TO BE WORKING A TWISTING POSITION AND SQUATTING DOWN AND STANDING UP
SO NOW HE'S A REALLY GOOD POSITION
COME BACK TO YOUR CENTER POSITION
YOU CAN HOLD THIS POSITION ABOUT FIVE TO TEN SECONDS
WHATEVER YOU GET IT IN TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S THE POSITION THAT FROM THAT POSITION FOR YOUR NOTES ARE PRESSED BREAK
THERE ARE A COUPLE WAYS TO MOUNT THE BINDINGS BUT THE STANDARD WAY TO DO IT IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE FORWARD POSITION SET AND THE BACK FOOT AT A POSITIVE THREE DEGREE ANGLE AND FRONT FOOT AT A POSITIVE FIFTEEN DEGREE ANGLE
THE OTHER DIFFERENT TYPES OF WAYS YOU CAN DO IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS PIGEON FOOTED WHEN YOU ANGLE THE BINDINGS FACING IN TOWARDS EACH OTHER DUCK FOOTED AN ANGLE THAT I HAVE THINGS AWAY FROM EACH OTHER FORWARD WHICH IS THE STANDARD WAY TO DO IT OR YOU CAN ALSO SET UP IN THE ALPINE OR RACING POSITION WHICH IS AN EXTREME FORM OF THE FOUR POSITION WHERE YOU TAKE BOTH FINDINGS AND ALMOST WANT TO MOUNT THEM PARALLEL WITH THE BOARD AND ONCE YOU DETERMINE THE WAY YOU WANT TO RIDE JUST INSERT YOUR HARDWARE AND THEY'RE ALSO
OKAY SO TO GET TO THAT CORNER TO REITERATE EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHITE FOR LEFT FOOT RIGHT FOOT LEFT FOOT THAT PUTS YOU IN A GOOD POSITION WHERE TO GO THREE STEP WE'RE GOING TO GO LEFT RIGHT LEFT
FOR ME OF BRAKE LEVER POSITION THIS A LOT MORE CRITICAL THAN SHIFTER POSITIONING BECAUSE BRAKES ARE IN THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOL YOU HAVE IN YOUR ARSENAL WHEN IT COMES TO CONTROL YOUR BIKE
YOU WANT TO GRIP THE RINGS SO THAT THE FINGER YOU'RE SPINNING ON IN MY CASE IT'S THE MIDDLE FINGER IS ALREADY IN POSITION TO ACCEPT THE RINGS
AND I'M GOING TO PUSH PULL IT OVER INTO THIS POSITION HERE WHERE THE SHADOW IS THE STRONGEST
AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE TRYING TO CONTROL THE SPEED TO COME BACK AND JUST GENTLY NURSE IT UP IN FRONT OF THE POCKET SO THAT WE GET IT INTO THE EASY SCORING POSITION SO THAT WE CAN GO BACK AND FORTH ONCE AGAIN
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT MY BODY POSITION IS IN FRONT OF THE HAIR THAT I'M ACTUALLY CUTTING
THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS YOU GRAB THE ARM WITH BOTH OF YOUR ARMS AND YOU DROP YOUR WEIGHT DOWN INTO THE HORSE STANCE RIGHT AWAY IT FORCES THE PERSON DOWN TO HARD POSITION FOR THEM TO MAINTAIN THEIR WHOLE
AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE LOCKED IN THIS POSITION IT'S BEST TO LOCK BECAUSE THAT WAY YOU DON'T YOU'RE NOT TEETERING LOCK WITH YOUR WHEELS AGAINST THE COPING
ONE OF THE TRICKS THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO LEARN BEFORE DOING THE FAKIE OLLIE DISASTER IS YOU'LL NEED TO KNOW HOW IT FEELS TO HAVE YOUR BACK WHEELS ABOVE THE TRANSITION AND ABLE TO GET OUT FROM THIS POSITION
IT'S EASY TO GET INTO THIS POSITION BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS BY ROLLING BACKWARDS WITH TOO MUCH SPEED AND YOU END UP BLOCKING OVER
AND BECAUSE YOU WANT TO FEEL IT FEELS LIKE TO MOVE FROM THE VERY BOTTOM WITH YOUR ARM UP IN THE FROG POSITION ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TIP
HAMSTRING CURL IN A PRONE POSITION WORKING EIGHT TO TEN REPS FOR BEGINNERS TEN TO TWELVE AND UP ONE TO THREE SETS
YOU WANT TO COME UP BACKWARDS OR RIGHT BEFORE YOU GET TO THE BAR YOU WANT TO PUT ALL THE WAY ON YOUR BACK FOOT SLAMMING THE TAIL DOWN INTO THE PLATFORM YOUR WHEELS AND TRUCKS INTO THE COPING GIVING US LOCKED IN POSITION IT SHOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WHEN YOU DO IT PROPERLY
THINGS I THINK ABOUT WHEN I POSITION MY TILES IS STARTING WITH THE CORNERS
SO YOU WANT TO JUST POSITION A FEW AT A TIME AND THEN GLUE THEM DOWN
SO IT'S HARD TO DEMONSTRATE JUST SITTING HERE WHAT I'M DOING LIKE AND JUST EVEN MY GENERAL POSITION
THE MAJOR THING THAT I KEEP COMING BACK TO OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT DISTURBING AWAY THIS SORT OF THING CALLED THE ATTACK POSITION WHICH IS NOW JUST LIKE IN SKIING WHERE LIKE A PARALLEL SHOULDERS SQUARED OFF TO THE HILL IS WHERE YOU'RE GOING FOR A CAN MEDICALLY
SO FOR THE NEXT DOUBLE STOP WE'RE LOOKING AT THE F AND SEE SO FOR A SECOND POSITION YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE STARTING IN SECOND ON THE D STRING ON THE OF SOME CAN SLIDE IT OFF AND THE C IS RIGHT ACROSS AN F SO THIS IS GETTING A CHANCE TO LEARN PLAY DOUBLE STOP WHERE YOUR FIRST FINGER IS GOING TO PRACTICE I'M HOLDING DOWN TWO STRINGS AT ONCE ON THE FINGER PATTERN
OKAY STARTING FROM A FIGHTING POSITION OKAY THERE'S TWO WAYS TO DO IT
SO YOU'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY HUNT FOR THE BEST POSITION
IF YOU WANT TO CUT THE BALL TO THE LEFT AND A CUTTER FASTBALL POSITION FINGERS ON THE LEFT HALF A BALL TO CREATE SPIN AND MOVEMENT THAT WOULD MAKE THE BALL BASICALLY CURVE TO THE RIGHT
IF YOU WANT TO CUT THE BALL TO THE RIGHT IN YOUR RIGHT HAND A PITCHER YOU WE CUT THE BALL IN HALF AND POSITION BOTH FINGERS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BALL
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TO BE SOLID IN POSITION
NOW IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM HOLDING ON TO THIS BALL YOU CAN ALWAYS CROSS YOUR ANKLES HER CRACKER THAN TRYING TO JUST POSITION YOUR FEET TO HOLD THE MEDICINE BALL
SO WATCH AS THE MAN USES THE LEG TO THE RAMP AT THE TOP OF THE RAMP LITTLE ROCK STEP RIGHT HERE AND AS HE MOVES BACK UP TO THE TOP OF THE RAMP ANOTHER ROCK STEP AND IT OPENS BACKUP ENDING IN A BASIC JUST LIKE WE LEARNED IN THE FIRST POSITION FOR ME AND IN THE POSE ROUTINE
IT'S FROM THE POSITION WE LEFT OFF AND IT'S A NICE AND TALL KEEPING BOTH HIP BONES ON MY SNACKS SOMETHING REACH FORWARD REACHING FORWARD TOWARDS THE WALL OR PARTY RATHER THAN STRAIGHT DOWN AND WITH YOUR EXHALATION DROPPING DOWN FARTHER
MANY TIMES YOU CAN ALSO CLOSE YOUR EYES AND JUST GET TO THE CORRECT POSITION AND YOU FEEL THE RIGHT POSITION
GO THERE AND FEEL THE CORRECT POSITION
THAT EVERYTHING IS LOCKED INTO POSITION
BALL COMES OFF THE RIBS ITS POSITION FIRST CONTACT FIRST TO MAKE SURE YOU FEEL THE OTHER GUY FIRST AND THEN YOU GO FOR THE BALL
SO YOU WANT TO ATTACK THE BALL WHICH IS WHAT YOU WOULD DO DURING THE PASSING PATTERN YOU WANT TO ATTACK THE BALL AND GET IT INTO YOUR POSITION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
AND IF YOU USUALLY HAVE SOMETHING AND YOUR HEAD SO THAT YOUR CHIN STARTS IN A CHIN TUCKED POSITION GO AHEAD AND REMOVE THAT NOW
OR JUST TAKE A CLUB IF YOU'RE WORKING SOMETHING THAT THE TOP OF YOUR SWING AND JUST PRACTICE THE POSITION
REMEMBER THAT EVEN IN THIS POSITION RIGHT WANT TO FEEL THE SHOULDER BACK THE SHOULDER FORWARD HEAD PRESSING UP
YOU'RE GOING TO RIDE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP AND AS YOU REACH THE CLIMAX YOU'LL PULL AROUND INTO A FRONT TUCK STAY IN THAT TUCK POSITION UNTIL YOU LAND
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF WE ARE IN THIS POSITION IN PERFECT POSITION THAT ON THE LEGS IN WITHOUT FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE THE STRENGTH AND BALANCE AND THEN WE'LL WORK UP THE BODY REALIGNING AGAIN IN ANATOMICAL POSITION SO THAT YOU CAN START TO REALIGNING SCALE TO STRUCTURE
SO THIS TIME WE POSITION OURSELVES WITHIN GLIDE OF THE LANDING FIELD MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE FURTHER AHEAD OF US SO WE HAVE ROOM TO ADD POWER
WE'RE GOING TO START THE POSITION OPTIONAL WITH THE WEIGHT
SO WE'LL PIN THAT DOWN AND THAT POSITION
AS MY BODY COMES TO POSITION THE SWORD COMES IN POSITION
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOU KEEP YOUR ARMS AT A LOCKED POSITION AT ALL TIMES WHEN YOU'RE ON THE GROUND
I WOULD HAVE THE LASH POSITION WITH EIGHTS AND ALL KIND OF AN AREA CEASES AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BRING BACK HOME ANYTHING LIKE THAT
STEP THREE IN A SQUAT POSITION
START OFF THE SIX THAT POSITION HERE
WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING THE GOOD SQUAT YOUR CORE IS REALLY HOLDING YOUR BODY INTO POSITION CORRECTLY
SO MAKE SURE IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE IN SECOND POSITION HERE AND THEY JUST ARE TO FLAPS MAKE THEM REALLY FLOPPY LIKE A PAYING ONE
YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO START IN A SQUAT POSITION WHEN YOU'RE FACING THE FRONT OKAY
THEN YOU'LL WANT TO OLLIE UP INTO THE MANUAL POSITION
AND REALLY GOOD WAY TO LEARN HOW TO EXIT FROM THE FIFTY FIFTY GRIND OR LEARN HOW TO OLLIE ONTO THE FIFTY FIFTY GRIND IS JUST SOMETIMES TO SET UP YOUR BOARD ON A LEDGE OR CURB SAFELY AND AND JUST WORK ON OLLIE OUT OF THAT POSITION
IF YOU TRY TO DO THIS ALL ONCE IT'S REALLY EASY AND THIS MOTION THE TRICK TO FALL OFF AND THE DATE AND GET OUT OF POSITION
OLLIE ONTO THE TOP ALL THE MANUAL POSITION AND THEN JUST BEFORE YOU GET TO THE END INSTEAD OF ROLLING STRAIGHT OFF OF A FRONT SIDE <UNK> TO FAKIE IS
ONE WAY TO DO THIS IS TO SET UP THE MANUAL POSITION SO THAT YOUR BODY IS TURNED JUST BEFORE YOU WANT TO BE OUT
ONE IS WHEN THIS GUARD PULLS OUT GO AND PLUG YOUR POSITION WHEN HE PULLS OUTSIDE WHEN HE PULLS OUT OF THAT GUARD POSITION THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE A BIG HOLE OPEN ON THIS SIDE
WHICH COMES FROM THE HANDSTAND POSITION AND SNAPPING YOUR FEET THREE TWO
NOW NOTICE MY HANDS ARE NINE OUT TO THE SIDE BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE CORRECT BODY POSITION
I'M GOING TO PUT MY HANDS DOWN IN FRONT AND THE SQUAT POSITION
ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR SKIS MOUNTED AND YOU'RE IN THE WATER YOU'RE GOING TO BE LAYING BACK WITH YOUR SKIS PARALLEL KNEES BENT UP TO YOUR CHEST ROPE WITH THE PROPER HAND POSITION IN BETWEEN THE SKIS
AND AS THEY DO YOU LET THEM RELAX AND IS ONCE YOU FEEL TENSION LINE UP UNDERNEATH AND LET THAT PERSON RELAX AND YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE YOUR HEAD BACK INTO POSITION OR MAINTAIN THAT SAME PRESSURE IN THAT SAME SPOT AS YOU HOLD THAT HEAD UP
YEAH SO I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU FROM A STANDING POSITION ARMS ABOVE MY HEAD
I'M GOING TO BEND DOWN AND MY KNEES IN A SQUAT POSITION AND PUT MY HANDS FLAT ON THE GROUND IN FRONT OF ME
SO THE PROPER TECHNIQUE FOR FOR A RAIL IS TO START WITH YOUR LEGS TOGETHER ARMS UP AND NOTICE I'M IN A STANDING POSITION
IN THIS SEGMENT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT AN EXTREMELY CRUCIAL ASPECT OF PLAYING THAT MANY PEOPLE OF TAUGHT OVER THE YEARS DON'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AND THAT'S HOW YOU HOLD THE GUITAR AND THE POSITION YOUR BODY'S ON
THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO START BECAUSE THEY CAN UTILIZE THE SUPPORT OF SIDE WALKERS EASIER AS WELL AS THEIR LEGS DON'T HAVE TO BE IN THE DOWN POSITION TO BE ABLE TO RIDE
SO IT'LL SOUND LIKE THIS AND YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS POSITION PROPERLY THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD SOUND
YOU WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF YOU WANT TO KNOW OF WHAT'S UP ABOVE YOU BEFORE YOU TAKE YOUR LADDER AND JUST AND TRY TO PUT IN A POSITION BECAUSE YOU MIGHT FIND THAT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO DO IT WITHOUT DAMAGING SOMETHING
AND FROM HERE AS WE INHALE FOR AGAIN BRING OUR SHOULDERS OVER OUR WRIST TO FIND A OILING PLANK POSITION
AND THEN TO FIND CHAD URANGA IN THE KNEELING POSITION IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE FULL POSITION WILL SHIFT SLOWLY FORWARD LOWERING HER ELBOWS TIGHT TO THE BODY
THEY MAY MOVE THEY MAY FIRE BACK ON ME THIS IS I HAVE NOT OVER COMMITTED ON A GOOD POSITION
SO I START MY REGULAR SIX FOR POSITION I DRAW MY LEFT FOOT IN AND I STEP TO THE SIDE ONE TWO
PRETEND THERE'S A STRING ON IT AND WE'RE GOING TO LIFT IT STRAIGHT UP AND THEN RELEASE IT BACK TO NEUTRAL POSITION
START CHEST IS GOING TO BE OUR NEUTRAL POSITION
IT IS YOUR CHILD IN THE POSITION OF LIFE WHERE HOME SCHOOL BENEFIT THEM
IS YOUR FAMILY IN A POSITION WHERE YOU CAN HOME SCHOOL THEM
IT'S JUST HERE TO HERE YOU'RE CHANGING YOUR FOOTWORK AND YOUR HAND POSITION
AND THEY GEL AND I DON'T FEEL UP TO A POSITION
HANDS CAN ALSO GO UP HIGH IF NEED TWO OR DOWN LOW BUT IT'S A THREAT ALWAYS IN THAT TRIPLE THREAT POSITION SIMILAR TO THE OFFICE
YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE IN FRONT OF YOUR DEFENDER IN A CROUCH POSITION WEIGHT EVENLY DISTRIBUTED ON THE BACK FOOT AS WELL AS THE FRONT
SO TRY THAT AGAIN SIX UP POSITION
YOU CAN HOLD THIS POSITION FIVE TO TEN SECONDS
IF YOU'RE HOLD THIS POSITION FOR FIVE TO TEN SECONDS
WHEN YOU'RE IN THIS POSITION THIS IS ABOUT AS DEEP AS I NEED TO GO
YOU WANT YOUR LOWER BACK IN THE BOTTOM POSITION TO HAVE A NICE LONG BAR CURVE TO IT
THEY'RE MORE PEOPLE THAT COULD HURT BY MOVING IN THIS MOTION FROM HYPER EXTENDED POSITION THAN I CARE TO THINK ABOUT
YOU SET UP WITH YOUR FOOT IN THE NOLLIE POSITION WITH THE TIP OF THE TOE ON THE BOARD SO THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO GET MAXIMUM ABILITY TO NOLLIE AND HEIGHT
NOLLIE HALF CAB KICK FLIP IS WHEN YOU RIDE IN THE NOLLIE POSITION NOLLIE <UNK> FLIP FRONTSIDE AND LAND FAKIE AND KEEP ROLLING
AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS HIT THE NOSE YOUR FOOT IS GOING TO CONTINUE UP THE BOARD AND FLIP THE BOARD ONE EIGHTY AND LAND IN THE FAKIE POSITION
ALMOST LIKE THE SWITCH POSITION BUT THINK OF IT IS RIDING SWITCHING FACE
UTILITY MAN WHILE HE MAY NOT SPECIALIZE IN ANY SPECIFIC POSITION HE HAS TO BE GOOD AT A VARIETY OF POSITIONS
PUT YOUR FOOT TO DIFFERENT POSITION EMPHASIZES CERTAIN MUSCLE
TRYING TO MAKE AN UPRIGHT SPINE POSITION
AND ONCE IT'S SETTLES YOU CAN TAP THE SIDE OF THE BUCKET JUST GENTLY AND THAT CAN URGE IT TO ITS FINAL POSITION
KEEPING THE CHEST AND BODY IN A GOOD UPRIGHT POSITION
KEEP YOUR BODY IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION SHOULDERS BACK HEAD UP BACK NICE AND STRAIGHT
ONE OF MY LEFT ARM COMES UNDERNEATH HER ELBOW LOCKING HER ELBOW INTO A STRAIGHT IN POSITION
SO FROM THIS POSITION WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO USE THE WEDGE OF MY HAND AND I'M GOING TO HIT IT RIGHT INTO MELISSA'S WRIST BONE OKAY
IT'S ACTUALLY THE POSITION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE GOING INTO
AS YOU MOVE TO THE SQUAT RACK STARTING OFF WITH A GOOD EVEN HAND POSITION ON THE BAR
THE BAR AND GOOD PROPER POSITION ACROSS THE UPPER BACK AND LOWER PART OF THE SHOULDER
WHEN YOU GET COMFORTABLE IN THIS POSITION JUST SIMPLY LIFT YOUR KNEE UP AND PLACE YOUR FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER
NOW MAKE SURE THAT YOUR ELBOW IS IN LINE WITH YOUR SHOULDER AND THEN ONCE YOU GET INTO THIS POSITION YOU CAN MODIFY BY KEEPING YOUR KNEE DOWN AND THEN HAVE THAT OTHER LEG FULLY EXTENDED
SAME THING WITH THE EXCESSIVELY CIRCUIT WHEN VEHICLES STARTED AND THE KEY IS RELEASE BACK TO THE ACCESSORY POSITION THAT AIR CONDITIONING BLOWER WILL WORK WINDOWS GOING GO UP AND DOWN AND SOME ENDS
WHEN THE CAR RETURNS BACK TO THE EXCESSIVELY POSITION THE RADIO STAYS OPERABLE
THE RADIO AND MOST VEHICLES WORK IN ACCESSORY POSITION
MOST ACCESS THE WIRES BY REMOVING THE DASH PANEL AND TAP AND THEN TO ACCESSORY ONE ACCESSORY TO IGNITION ONE IGNITION TO AND STARTING POSITION
AND YOU WANT TO JUST BE A REALLY SLOW TRANSITION FROM AN UP PART TO A DOWN POSITION BOOK
SO I'LL TAKING IT FROM THIS POSITION HERE
SO YOU'LL FIND THAT YOUR FIRST AND FOURTH FINGER UP IN THE OFF POSITION YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE SAME EXCEPT THE WHOLE HAND IS SHIFTED UP A WHOLE STEP SO FROM THE FIRST ONE WE'RE GOING TO LEARN B OCTAVE SO HE GETS TO BE SLIDE UP TO THE B FROM THE G STRING
SO ALWAYS CHECK AND MAKE SURE HOLE IN THE RIGHT POSITION
THE HOLDING IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE HOLDING THE CORRECT POSITION SO IT'LL BE WEIGHTED SO YOU CAN GET THE PROPER SPINS THE PROPER CHOPS FOR YOUR EXTREME COLIFORM
AND BRING OUR POSITION BACK TO CENTER
ALRIGHT THIS THREE GUYS BRING THE BALL DOWN IS AS SOON AS I BRING THE BALL DOWN IS THE FIRST TWO GUYS OFF THE SIDELINE COME IN AND ESTABLISH THE DEFENSIVE POSITION
PUSH FORWARD EXHALE SIT BACK WATCH THE POSITION OF THE KNEE NICE AND SLOW AND CONTROLLED
LIE BACK IN THE CRUNCH POSITION I'M GOING TO COME UP AND THEN COME DOWN BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO COME ALL THE WAY DOWN BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO COME DOWN AND DO A SIDE BID CRUNCH UP SIDE BEND OTHER SIDE UP SIDE BENT THE BREATH AND YOU CONTINUE DOING THAT UNTIL YOU REACH REPS OF THE BELT ALSO A TWELVE
THEN I'M GOING TO OPEN MY TOES UP TO FIRST POSITION
YOU WANT TO POSITION YOUR SONG HORSES SO THAT THE MATERIAL YOU ARE CUTTING HANGS OFF A LITTLE BIT ON EACH SIDE
YOU'RE ASKING WE'RE MUSCLE GROUP MUSCLES ON THE SIDES TO LIFT THE LEG OUT AND MORE DIFFICULT POSITION
FRONT SIDE NOSE SLIDE IS WHEN YOU OLLIE OVER A LEDGE ROLLING UP TO IT IN THE FRONT SIDE POSITION AND LAND ONLY ON YOUR NOSE AND YOUR TWO FRONT WHEELS SLIDE ACROSS THE TOP AND THEN POP OUT STRAIGHT AND ROLL AWAY
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS SET UP IN THE OLLIE POSITION WITH YOUR FEET READY TO CREEP UP INTO THE NOSE POSITION IN THE AIR SO THAT YOU CAN LAND IN THE NOSE ONE SLIDE
STEMMING IS A TECHNIQUE THAT USES THE OFF POSITION OF FORCES ACROSS THE CORNER TO MAKE USE OF HANDED FOOTHOLDS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE NOT HELP YOU
AND WHEN YOU GO DOWN YOU HOLD THAT POSITION SO THE MUSCLES ARE LEARNING TO SUPPORT THE HEAD AND THE PROPER POSTURE FOR EVEN STANDING OR SITTING IN THE OFFICE
SO THE NEXT STEP AFTER YOU'VE TUNED WITH THE PIANO AND BEFORE YOU START PLAYING AS YOU WANT TO FIND A GOOD POSITION FROM THE PIANO
SO REALLY POSITION YOURSELF RIGHT AFTER YOU'VE TUNE AND FINDING A GOOD SPOT MAYBE RIGHT HERE SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF AN ANGLE
ONCE YOU'VE DONE YOUR POSITION THEN YOU CAN SET UP YOUR VIOLIN A AND GIVE THEM A SIGNAL
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE AND SLIP IT BETWEEN YOUR SPINDLE AND YOUR BALL JOINT AND HAMMERED INTO POSITION
YOU TAKE YOUR HANDS SAME POSITION RIGHT HAND PALM UP LEFT HAND PALM DOWN
REMEMBER AN OLLIE IS WHEN YOU'RE RIDING IN THE SWITCH POSITION BUT FAKIE WHICH MEANS PRETTY MUCH RIDING BACKWARDS SO IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR OPPOSITE FEED ON THIS ONE SO IT'S GOING TO FEEL A LITTLE DIFFICULT AT FIRST BUT YOU KNOW EVENTUALLY YOU BECOME A LITTLE BIT AMBIDEXTROUS AND IT WON'T FEEL SO WEIRD BUT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THIS YOU WANT TO HAVE THE NOLIE PRETTY MUCH DOWN PAT BECAUSE THE FOUNDATION TO THE WHOLE TRICK
JUST PUT A SMALL PIECE OF SCOTCH TAPE DOWN IN THE POSITION AND YOU TAKE IT TO THE MACHINE AND JUST LINE IT UP RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE FOOT IN
YOU CAN ALSO TRY A MORE CHALLENGING POSITION WITH THE LEGS EXTENDED AND JUST BRINGING YOUR ARMS OVERHEAD OR WHAT SEAMS OVERHEAD IN THIS POSITION AND THEN DOWN
THE DOT COM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT NOW IS MOUNTING A SHOTGUN GETTING THE SHOTGUN THE POSITION WHERE YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE THE END OF THE END OF THE GUN AND ALSO SEE THE TARGET
KEEP YOUR FEET IN A NICE GENERAL POSITION WE BEGIN AND USE YOUR UPPER BODY TO ADJUST AND HOLD THE MANUAL FOR THE WHOLE DISTANCE OF THE OF THE TOP OF THE PAD OF
ALRIGHT TO DO THE BEGINNER ABERLE OR WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR ABERLE ARE GOING TO POSITION OUR HANDS ON IT LIKE SO LIKE I SAID MIND THE WHEEL
JUST GET ON TOP OF THE BOARD IN THE FRONT SIDE FIFTY FIFTY POSITION
SO THIS IS A GREAT POSITION TO USE WHEN YOU'RE JUST STARTING YOUR DANCE AS AN OPENING AND MOVING INTO OTHER MOVEMENT
SO REMEMBER AGAIN YOU START OFF PRAYER POSITION
YOU COULD DO IT OFF FROM A CURVE AND THEN LAND IN A SAFE POSITION
NOW IN THE EVENT THAT THAT AUTOMOBILE AHEAD OF US COMES UP OUT OF THE NEXT IT ANY COMES TO A STOP SIGN OR IT COMES TO A RED LIGHT WHEN YOU DRIVE A BEHIND THIS VEHICLE DON'T COME UP TO HIM RIGHT ON HIS BUMPER STAY BACK AS FAR AS YOU WHEN YOU CAN SET IN A COMFORTABLE POSITION AND LOOK AND SEE THE BANDS OR WOMENS TIRES ON THE GROUND
SO I START FROM MY SIX FOR POSITION LEFT HAND OUT RIGHT HAND BY NAVAL
AT THIS POSITION I WANT TO REALLY FEEL MY HIP PUSH FORWARD
BUT TO SUCK UP YOUR KNEES WHEN THEY'RE IN THE AIR THAT WAY THE LEG IS COMING UP YOU CAN POSITION YOU WANT TO LAND
I WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE BALL IN THE CORNER POCKET WHICH I WOULD MAKE A AND THEN I WOULD HAVE MYSELF IN A POSITION YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TRY TO PLAY POSITION IT'S ANOTHER VIDEO TAPE FOLKS GOOD I PUT MYSELF IN SUCH A POSITION THAT I COULD PLAY THE OF THE TIME BALL IN THIS CORNER AND MAKE MY CUE BALL COME OUT FOR A GOOD POSITIONING SHOT FOR THE EIGHT BALL AND WINNING THE GAME
SO I WOULD SAY TEN BALL IN THE CORNER AND YOU SEE THE CUE BALL COMES OUT TO A POSITION ON THE TABLE WHERE I HAVE A NICE SHOT ANGLE SHOT FOR THE EIGHT BALL ON THE CORNER
THE SET POINT IS THAT POSITION TO WHERE I AM JUST OUTSIDE OF THIS IS WHAT I CAN STEP IN AND FIRE ON HIM AND HE CAN STEP IN AND FIRE ME
I'LL PERFORM IT ON A STRAIGHT ANGLE SO YOU CAN SEE FROM A FORWARD POSITION HERE
THINK OF OUR KNEE AND SPIN ALL THAT ON ALL ABOUT THE STARTING POSITION
I MEAN BY FIRE TO GO AHEAD SET HOT FIRE UP OKAY HE'S KEEPING THIS GUY OUT SO THIS GUY CAN'T GET UNDERNEATH POSITION AND LOCK HIM OUT
SO I'M GOING TO GO OUT AND STAY IN THE BOTTOM POSITION
SO KNEE STAYS OUT OVER THE FEET FEET ARE RELATIVELY STRAIGHT AHEAD BACK LEG IS STRAIGHT AND THEN WE PUSH BACK UP THE MIDDLE POSITION
THE NEXT THING IS YOU OUT YOU ALWAYS WANT TO KEEP YOUR YOUR HANDS IN A A FORMAL GRACEFUL SORT OF POSITION
THESE ARE POSITION YOUR TENT
SO WE BRING OUR ARMS OUT AND HER EYE THIS ARM POSITION
I COULD TAKE THIS AND HOLD IT WIDE TAKE IT DOWN TO A SQUAT POSITION
YOU START THE EXACT SAME WAY AS A SIX STEP SIX STEP POSITION TO KIND OF LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
JUST KIND OF AS A RECAP REMEMBER HOW IMPORTANT YOUR HEAD POSITION IS FOR EVERY SCALE
IF YOU'RE HAVING A HARD TIME I'M COMPLETING ONE OF YOUR TUMBLING PASS IS CORRECTLY REALLY GO BACK AND TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHERE YOUR HEAD IS GOING IN YOUR PASS AND YOU CAN WORK ON THAT IN YOUR MIND AND AND AND REALLY TRY IT AGAIN WITH THE PROPER HEAD POSITION
THE SAME THING REALLY GOES FOR YOUR ROUND OFF AND YOUR CARTWHEEL KEEPING IT IN THAT TUCK POSITION
SO SET UP IN THE REGULAR NOLLIE POSITION YOU'RE GOING TO TURN YOUR BODY AND HEAD IN THE BLIND INSIDE POSITION OR BLINDSIDE DIRECTION
YOU'LL SET UP YOUR FEET A LITTLE BIT WITH YOUR TOES WITH YOUR TOE HANGING OFF THE FRONT AND THIS IS A IN ANTICIPATION OF YOUR FOOT TRAVELING AND SETTING UP IN SO THAT YOU LAND IN A GOOD ROLLING POSITION
TYPICALLY A PATIENT OR TURN TO THE OFFICE WITHIN TWO OR THREE DAYS FOR AN INITIAL EXAMINATION TO ENSURE THAT ALL AS WELL THAT THE IMPLANTS ARE IN GOOD POSITION THAT THERE IS NOT BEEN ANY EXCESSIVE BLEEDING OR SWELLING AND THAT THE PATIENT IS COMFORTABLE
THE TWISTING I'M STARTING TO BE A SUCCESSFUL PARTICULARLY IN LOOKING OF THE WEEK PARTS OF THAT POSITION
WE HAVE TITLE ONE COORDINATORS THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE POSITION OUR SCHOOL
HI I'M JAN KAIN AND CONTINUING ON WITH OUR TAI CHI LESSON WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FROM THIS POSITION FROM SINGLE WHIP INTO PLAY THE GUITAR
SO WHATEVER POSITION EITHER WITH THE LEG EXTENDED SO THAT BOTH HIPS CAN BE DOWN OR WITH THE HEEL BACK TOWARDS YOUR OPPOSITE HIP WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU
THE ROOT POSITION OF A OF A DIMINISHED SEVENTH IS JUST LIKE THAT ONE FLAT THREE FLAT FIVE DOUBLE FLAT IT'S SEVEN
OKAY SO WE GOT THE DIMINISHED SEVENTH CHORD IN ITS ROOT POSITION
NOTICE MY FINGER ANGLE IS MORE IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION
FOUR AND THEN OUR FIVE I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE IT RIGHT HERE IN FOR IN A ROOT POSITION
IT'S GOING TO GO TO THE FIVE IN ROOT POSITION BACK TO THE ONE

AND THE MORE CHALLENGING POSITION YOU'RE GOING TO SLIDE THE HAND DOWN THE THIGH AND COME ON IN WITH AN INHALE AND EXHALE
TAKE A KNEELING POSITION AND AGAIN PULL THE BALL INTO MY HIP AND PLACE THE HIP ON TOP OF THE BALL TO LEAN OVER AND I'VE JUST PLACE MY HAND AT THE SIDE AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS REDUCE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN MY RIB CAGE AND MY HIP
ANOTHER THING TO DO TO GET EXPERIENCE WHETHER YOU'RE ENTERING THE FIELD JUST OUT OF STUDYING OR IT WITH THE YOU WANT TO ADVANCE FROM SOMETHING LIKE A DESIGN ASSISTANT INTO A MORE RESPONSIBLE AND CREATIVE POSITION IS TO DO PROJECTS FOR COMPANIES
SO YOU CAN SEE THAT HE CAUSE TEND TO PULL UP AND SHOOT A JUMP SHOT MAYBE EVEN GET A CHARGE BECAUSE HE WAS THERE HE WAS SET ON THE POSITION HAND STRAIGHT UP AND THIS GUY WITH INTO IT
WHEN YOU'RE DOING STRETCHES YOU NOT WORRY ABOUT WHETHER THE SHOULDERS REACH UP OR ANY KIND OF POSTURAL WHERE YOUR HEAD IS OTHER THAN TO MAKE SURE IT'S STILL SUPPORTED SO THAT IT'S NOT IN A AND EXTENDED POSITION
THERE'S ALSO WHAT'S CALLED AN X STRETCH WHERE YOU BRING YOUR ARMS OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT OVER SHOULDER POSITION AND YOUR FEET ARE GOING TO BE OUT A LITTLE BIT WIDER TO THEN YOU'RE GOING TO STRETCH WITH THE RIGHT HAND AND THE LEFT LEG BRINGING THAT IN EXHALE STRETCH WITH THE RIGHT LEG LEFT CAN BRING THAT AND ONE MORE TIME STRETCH WITH THE OPPOSITE AND BRING IT IN AND STRETCH WITH THE OPPOSITES AND BRING IT IN THE LEGS COME TOGETHER ARMS COME TOGETHER ONE MORE ABDOMINAL STRENGTH REACH AS FAR AS YOU CAN AND BRING THE ARMS IN AND DOWN
UP UP UP UP AND THEN TAKE THEM DOWN AND FINISH IN THIS POSITION
BRUSH IT OUT IN AN UPWARD POSITION AND THEN ALL THE WAY DOWN
GET YOUR SHOULDERS AND THEN IN THE POSITION THAT YOU WANT TO LAND IN AND FRONT SIDE WITH A AND ROLL AWAY FAKIE
THIS PUTS THE CLAY IN A GOOD POSITION TO BE THROWN
WE POP THE OLLIE YOUR SHOULDERS WOULD POSITION THEMSELVES OVER THE RAIL JUST LIKE THAT EXCEPT YOU HAVE YOUR BOARD ON
SO THE LAST POSITION WE DID WAS DOWN DOG
OKAY OUR NEXT SHOT ARE ON OUR THREE MOST BASIC CUE BALL POSITION SHOTS IS THE STOP SHOT
SO FROM THIS POSITION RIGHT HERE IN ORDER TO SLIDE THIS BALL FROM THERE TO THEIR IT SHOULD BE A SIMPLE MATTER OF HITTING IT RIGHT AT THE CENTER
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO UNDERSTAND AND THAT YOU JUST HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE BALL WHEN YOU'RE IN A CERTAIN POSITION AND YOU PUT THE BALL UP THEIR OFF OF THE GLASS IT'S GOING OFF A COME IN AND BOUNCE INTO THE TO THE RIM NOW TURN THERE'S MANY
THIS ARM POSITION WE CALLED THE ARMS
BUT IN THIS POSITION WE ACTUALLY DO BRING THE HANDS AND FROM THE BODY
SEATED TWIST CAN EITHER BE DONE IN THE TRADITIONAL INDIAN STYLE POSITION HALF LOTUS WITH YOUR FOOT UP ON YOUR THIGH OR IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET ADVANCE WITH THAT YOU CAN HAVE BOTH FEET
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS IN BASKETBALL TO EXECUTE UP HAVING TO DO WITH THE TIMING AND THE POSITION OF THE BASKETBALL WITH THE TWO PLAYERS
SO FROM HERE TO GET UP TO FLY LIKE THAT SO STARTING OUT WITH YOUR HIPS CLOSE TO THE WALL IN THE NORMAL OVERHANG CLIMBING POSITION PUSHING HARD OR THE LEGS AND USING YOUR ARMS TO DIRECT WE'RE GOING TO SEND YOUR FLYING IN THE DIRECTION YOU WANT TO GO
WHEN YOU'RE AT THE TO THE PROPER POSITION OF THE TEA YOU CAN COVER EVERY SHOT IN THE GAME OF SQUASH
AND YOU'RE GOING TO REACH ACROSS PATCH THAT KNEE PULL THE OBLIQUES SQUEEZE AND THEN COME BACK TO YOUR BEGINNING POSITION WITH YOUR ARM NICE AND OPEN AND YOUR SHOULDER RELAXED

WE JUST FINISHED OUR LOCUST POSITION OR SEQUENCE SO BRING THE ARMS FORWARD INTO IT MORE OF A SUPERMAN POSITION HERE
I'M GOING TO WEDGE AND I'M GOING TO PUSH PUSH WITH MY OUTSIDE LEG IN THERE I AM IN POSITION
I SHOULD BE FOURTH POSITION
SO WATCH RIGHT NOW REVERSE ONE HALF TUCK POSITION FOR

A LOT OF TIMES YOU'LL SEE PEOPLE MAKE THE MISTAKE AND GO INTO THE POSITION WITH THE REAR FOOT TURN BACK OR THE REAR FOOT TURN THIS WAY
OTHER WOMEN MIGHT FEEL AND THE BACK BUT DEPENDING ON THE POSITION OF THE BABY
THE LAST IN OUR IT THREE BASIC CUE BALL POSITION SHOTS IS THE DROP SHOT
THE HANDS ARE IN WHAT'S CALLED A SPLIT GUARD POSITION
SHE'S GOING TO GRAB THOSE HANDS STRAPS AND THE STARTING POSITION IS REACHING THE ARMS RIGHT IN FRONT OF US KEEPING A SOFT AND AT THE ELBOW JUST AS IF YOU'RE A HUG IN A BIG BIG TREE
THEY HAVE FENDERS THEY HAVE AN UPRIGHT RIDING POSITION A COMFORTABLE SEAT AND THEY CAN BE SHIFT WHILE THEY'RE STOPPED
SO FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT ONE TWO THREE YOU'RE GOING TO SIT DOWN PUT YOUR FOOT TOGETHER AND BEND YOUR KNEE AND THE SAME POSITION LIKE YOUR CUE TO THE TO COME
FIRST OF ALL YOU DON'T WANT TO POSITION ALL OF YOUR TILES BEFORE STARTING TO GLUE THEM BECAUSE ONCE YOU START GLUING THEY'LL MOVE JUST A LITTLE BIT AND THEN IT'S NOT GOING TO FIT ANYMORE

SO I'LL GO TO THE BOTTOM POSITION SHOW YOU SOME THINGS THERE
AND AS YOU SELL HOUSE PRAYER POSITION
IF YOU JUST GO FOR THE BALL WITHOUT ESTABLISHING CONTACT ALL OF A REALLY SMART PLAYER LIKE MYSELF WILL SLIDE IN FRONT OF YOU MAY BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THE POSITION
OCCASIONALLY WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING IN YOU GET LEFT TO SHOCK WHERE THE CUE BALL IS CLOSE TO ANOTHER BALL OR YOU PLAY POSITION AND YOU HAVE PLAYED IT VERY WELL AND YOU'VE GOT TO SHOOT OVER A BALL
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO POSITION YOUR BODY FRONT AND BACK A LITTLE BIT IN BETWEEN
IT IS A IT LOTS OF SLIDE BACK IN THE OPEN POSITION
IF THAT STILL YOU'RE STILL WANT TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING ADDITIONAL AND COME BACK TO ORIGINAL ROW POSITION AND YOU CAN ADD A ROTATION
NOW YOU WANT TO SPEND SOME TIME ROLLING BACKWARDS IN GETTING COMFORTABLE IN THIS POSITION BECAUSE SINCE YOU DON'T ROLL BACKWARDS VERY OFTEN IT CAN SOMETIMES CATCH YOU OFF GUARD IF YOU HIT SOMETHING TO ROLL AND FALL DIRECTLY IN THE DIRECTION YOU'RE HEADED SO YOU'RE ROLLING BACKWARDS AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR FEET IN THE OLLIE POSITION
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO TAKE THEM ROLLING BACKWARDS AND DO THE EXACT SAME THING AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IS SET UP IN A VERY SIMILAR FOOT POSITION AS YOU WOULD ROLLING FAKIE ROLLING FORWARD FOR THE FAKIE OLLIE
SO YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU'RE GETTING INTO THE SPORT YOU DO IT SAFE POSITION PROPER WAY AND TAKE GLASSES FROM A CERTIFIED INSTRUCTOR
NOW WE'RE GOING TO INTRODUCE D WE'VE ALREADY HAD C E AND G NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE UP THE KEYBOARD D AND YOU'LL FIND THESE ARE ALWAYS IN THE SAME POSITION IN THE KEYBOARD WHICH IS THE BEAUTY OF AN ACCORDION
SO IF WE GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOK AT JENNIFER BRINGING HERSELF BACK INTO THE GLUE CLIENT POSITION WE SEE THAT THE HEELS BECOME CLOSER INTO THE GROINS IN THE BELT THE SUPPORTING ALL THE WORK
I'M GOING TO PLAY THE FIVE IN ROOT POSITION
IF THERE IS A PIANO INTRO ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS JUST POSITION YOURSELF AND THEN JUST GIVE THEM A SINGLE THAT YOU'RE READY
HE LEADS UP WHEN IT GETS TO THE UP POSITION YOU'RE GOING TO ROTATE IT AND THE HEEL COMES BACK DOWN
SHE'S GOT HER A GOOD POSITION SHE'S STRONGER SEE SHE'S READY TO TRY TO USE THAT DART LIKE STICK IT
NOW ON THE FOREHAND SIDE YOU CAN GO ALL LAUGHED BIG AND RIGHT YOU CAN COVER A HUGE MANA CHORD IF YOU TAKE YOU THAT'S USUALLY DO THAT WHEN YOU'RE UNDER SOME TYPE OF PRESSURE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE THE STRONGEST POSITION SO YOU CAN SEE IF YOU'RE HERE YOU'RE IN KIND OF A RELATIVELY WE POSITION AND YOU CAN TURN IT AROUND IS A GOOD SHOT BUT TO GETTING TO THE CORNER MORE UPRIGHT POSITION IS BETTER
THE FOUR POSITION IS USUALLY A LITTLE BIT BIGGER OF A PLAYER THEN WHAT WE USE FOR OUR GUARDS
SO WE CAN USE HIM OUT ON THE WING AS AN OUTSIDE SHOOTER WHAT WE CALL THE SMALL FORWARD POSITION WHICH IS ACTUALLY LIKE ANOTHER BIG GUARD
GOOD SOON AS ALL FOURS HIT THE GROUND I RELEASE PRESSURE OFF THE LEASH AND STAND AND SHE SHOULD REMAIN IN A DOWN POSITION
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO A GUIDE IT DOWN THIS IS GOING TO BE FROM A STANDING POSITION SO AS YOU'RE WALKING WITH YOUR DOG IF YOU NEED ARE TO DO A DOWN IT'S FROM A STAND
SO THAT IS HOW YOU DO YOUR CHEST PRESS IN A BRIDGE POSITION
WE DON'T WANT TO BE UP HERE WHERE YOUR LOWER BACK IS ON THE BALL AS YOU'RE PUSHING UP BECAUSE IT'S GOT A LOT OF STRAIN IN YOUR NECK SO AS YOU'RE SETTING UP KEEP YOUR FREE WEIGHTS DOWN BY YOUR SIDES AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME FROM A SEATED POSITION TO ROLL YOURSELF ALL THE WAY DOWN UNTIL YOU FEEL YOUR HEAD AND YOUR SHOULDERS TOUCH THE BALL
NUMBER TWO IS WATER AND NUMBER THREE THE POSITION OF THE LEFT HAND GRIP
YOU AT LEAST HAVE TO START OUT IN A POSITION WHERE ITS NATURAL AND THAT MIGHT BE IN THE SAME POSITION IS YOUR ARM HANGS
BUT WE USE A SPINE ALIGNER WORTH THE FRONT OF THE THAWING MUSCLES AND YOU CAN LEAVE THE SAME POSITION THAT IS THE LUCIO UP
AS THEY ARE IN THE SUPERMAN POSITION YOU HAVE ANOTHER KIT OR ANYBODY BROTHER BY THE WAIST WHICH IS SWIRLING OR ON THE WATER TO MAKE THEM ALL AROUND
AND IN THIS STEP I'M GOING TO BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO TAKE THOSE PAPER PATTERN PIECES THAT YOU CUT APART AND I'M GOING TO BE SPRAYING THEM WITH SOME POSITION WE'LL GLUE
GO AHEAD AND SWITCH SIDES POST YOUR FOOT IN THE CENTER OF THE BALANCE TRAINER TO BOTH HANDS ON THE MAT A SMALL BODY AN UPRIGHT POSITION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PUSH FORWARD AND SET IT BACK
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SIT BACK INSIDE SQUAT POSITION AND PUSH YOUR BALANCE AND PUSH YOUR MEDICINE BALL FORWARD
OPEN CHORDS BASICALLY TALKS ABOUT FIRST POSITION CHORDS WHICH IS WITHIN THE FIRST THREE FRETS AND THEY'RE CALLED OPEN CHORDS BECAUSE YOU'RE UTILIZING OPEN STRINGS AND ALL OF THESE CHORDS
YOU WANT TO HOLD IT ABOUT THREE TO FIVE SECONDS OR MORE IN THE UP POSITION AND LOWER
ALLOW YOUR MAT HANDS IN FRONT OF YOU LEGS THE BEHIND YOU KEEP YOUR LEGS ABOUT HIP WIDTH APART AND SO STARTING POSITION IS HERE AND WE LIFT UP HOLD IT AND LOWER LIFT UP HOLD AND LOWER
MELTING IS KIND OF A WAY TO SMOOTH TRANSITION FROM ONE POSITION TO ANOTHER SO LET'S JUST SAY IF WE STARTED AND OUR PIECE AND WE'RE UP HERE AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO TO THIS POSITION
WITH YOUR BASE IT MAYBE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER OR LOWER POSITION DEPENDING ON HOW IT'S SET UP
THIS IS A GREAT TOOL FOR GOLF FOR FOOD BAD UP THE GOOD HYBRID EFFECT CORRECT AND A GOOD IMPACT POSITION
THIS EFFECT BACK IS REALLY GOING TO TEACH YOU THE HABIT OF COMMON TO THE CORRECT IMPACT POSITION AND IF YOU NOTICE HERE MY WEIGHT IS WELL INTO MY LEFT SIDE THE CLUB FACE IS BEHIND MY HANDS SO MY HANDS HER HEAD AND IN THIS POSITION I'M ABLE TO HIT DOWN ON THE BALL
IT WILL HOLD THAT IN A STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN POSITION
ANOTHER THING I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT IS THE TONGUE POSITION AND I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO SOUND A LITTLE WE'RE BUT JUST TRY IT OUT
MOVING UP TO OUR ROOT POSITION YOU DO IT
AGAIN IN THIS POSITION YOU WANT TO GET YOUR HEAD RESTING ON THE BALL AND NOT LET YOUR HIPS SAG SO YOU'RE GOING TO USE THE GLUTES TO CONTRACT TO LIFT THE HIPS AND HAVE YOUR HEAD IN LINE WITH YOUR SPINE
THIS EXERCISE IS GOING TO ADD TARGET THE PECTORALS MAJOR THE LAST THE ADULT AVOIDS AS WELL AS THE STABILITY OF HOLDING YOURSELF INTO THAT BRIDGE POSITION
SO YOU SHOOT UP MORE TO THE SKY UP AS WELL AS MAYBE PUT MYSELF AND L.A TO POSITION AND SHOOT DOWN ON A MODELED AS WELL
KIND OF MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE STAYING IN RIGHT POSITION
SHE'S GOING TO COME ON DOWN INTO A TABLE TOP POSITION
SO PLAYING CHORD VOICINGS IN THIS SEGMENT I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU DIFFERENT WAYS TO PLAY YOUR CHORDS AND JUST SO YOU CAN SOUND A LITTLE BIT MORE PROFESSIONAL WITH YOUR PLAYING AS OPPOSED TO JUST JUMPING FROM BLOCK ROOT POSITION CHORDS
I COULD PROBABLY LOWER MY SEAT A LITTLE BIT BUT WHEN YOU LOWER YOUR SEAT TOO MUCH YOU END UP HAVING A PRETTY UNCOMFORTABLE RIDING POSITION
I'M GOING TO TAKE MY PICKLE FORK AND SLIP IT BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM AND HAMMER INTO POSITION
THEY DON'T WANT TO USE MOMENTUM BRINGING UP TO THE BAR SO IF YOU NEED SOME EXTRA ASSISTANCE YOU CAN HAVE SOMEONE HOLD YOUR FEET AND HELP SLIGHTLY PUSH YOU UP THAT ELEVATE YOU OR YOU CAN HAVE A CHAIR UNDERNEATH LIKE HALFWAY DOWN SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE GROUND FOR YOUR PULL UP POSITION
I'M GOING TO START WITH THE SIT POSITION SIT SPECIALTY WOULD ON COMMAND
THEN WHEN YOU'RE READY TO CATCH THE YOYO YOU ACTUALLY TAKE YOUR HAND AND TURN IT FROM THE PALM UP POSITION TO THE PALM DOWN POSITION
AND LIKE I SAY THIS IS A STYER RACER EACH ONE IS YOU WANT IT BEHIND A PERSON AND THEY'RE RUNNING FALL POSITION INTO THAT EVENT OR INTO THE RICE
WE CAN DO THEM IN A MODIFIED POSITION WHICH WOULD BE ON THE KNEES
IN THIS SEGMENT I KIND OF WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A POSITION THE SOFT BOX
OR YOU CAN MAKE THE SAME POSITION EXCEPT PUT YOUR RING FINGER ON THE B STRING ON THE THIRD FRET AND YOUR PINKIE ON THE THIRD FRET ON THE HIGH E STRING I HAVE A SLIGHTLY FOR SOUNDING CHORD
YOU CAN SET YOURSELF UP IN THE POSITION AND PRACTICE POPPING OUT AND ROLLING AWAY
HE'S IN THE OFF POSITION IN THE PARKING BRAKE WITH THAT
SO FROM THIS POSITION SHUT AN OPEN SHUT AND OPEN
NOW IT'S A PRETTY GOOD SCORING POSITION DEPENDING ON HOW WELL I CAN KICK
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO TO FIX THAT IS YOU WANT TO SET UP IN YOUR HEEL FLIP POSITION TO HIT THE TAIL AND AND REPLACE THE WEIGHT ON THE FRONT SIDE OF IT SO THAT YOUR WEIGHT IS BALANCED EVENLY AND IT ENDS UP FLIPPING STRAIGHT AND YOU'RE ABLE TO ROLL AWAY
WHAT PEOPLE USUALLY DON'T DO IS WHILE THE ROLLING BACKWARDS THEY TEND TO LEAN BACK THIS WAY ONCE THEY'VE OLLIE AND HEEL FLIP AND KEEP GOING IN THIS POSITION
SOME OF THE COMMON MISTAKES THAT PEOPLE MAKE WHILE THEY'RE LEARNING HOW TO FAKIE HEEL FLIP ARE USUALLY JUST BEING COMFORTABLE ROLLING IN THE FAKIE POSITION
IN THE BEGINNING YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TOO LOW IS A STARTING POSITION AS YOU INCREASE THIS EXERCISE YOU WANT TO BEGIN STARTING MAYBE ABOUT ONE TO TWO MINUTES HOLDING AND THEN YOU WANT TO WORK YOUR WAY UP ANYWHERE TO FIVE TO TEN MINUTES
AGAIN THAT'S THE LOWEST POSITION ON THE NECK THAT WE CAN PLAY THIS CHORD SHAPE AND
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOK AT OUR E SHAPE AND THE OPEN POSITION
SHE'S GOING TO CHAMBER THE HANDS TO THE WAIST START FROM THIS POSITION AND HANDS A LITTLE BIT LOWER ONE AND TWO BOTH HANDS COME OUT SAME TIME FIST GOOD KEEPING THEM RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR SHOULDERS OPEN THE HANDS THE PALM CROSS ONE WRIST OVER THE OTHER WRIST BRING THE HANDS DOWN TOUCH THE SIZE NOW LIFT UP BEND THE ELBOWS AND COME FORWARD
