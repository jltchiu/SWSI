IF OUR BLADE HER REALLY DOES MAKE CONTACT WITH MINE THEN I THEN I IRIS LOSING RIGHT AWAY BEING CANDIDATES BEING PARRIED AND OF COURSE THAN DID A THAN THE MANA ABILITIES MIND IN MY OPPONENT'S MOST LIKELY TO SQUIRT TOUCH

ONE THING THAT YOU NEED TO REMEMBER ABOUT TELLING THE WHOLE CROWD WHAT YOUR PLATFORM IS IS THAT YOU NEED TO STAND UP STRAIGHT AND HAVE GOOD POSTURE AND WHATEVER YOU DO HAVE EYE CONTACT WITH THE JUDGES IN THE CROWD SO THAT YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE VERY CONFIDENT AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
ONCE WE FIND OUR MAN WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO HIM WE'RE GOING TO MAKE CONTACT ARE GOING TO STAND HIM UP AND NOT ALLOWED TO GO AROUND IT
IT HAS BASICALLY ONE CONTACT IT MAKES WITH THAT PLUG
IF WE KIND OF PLUG IT IN THERE YOU CAN SEE SEE THAT CONTACT WAS MADE THERE
IT ONLY HAS THE ONE KIND OF CONTACT
THESE WILL ALSO PREVENT CONTACT POINTS OF YOUR SKIN BETWEEN YOUR THIGHS
WHAT I DO MY TRAINING I SHARE ALL OF THE NAMES I HAVE COMPANIES THAT HAVE CONTACT TO BE LOOKING FOR PROFESSIONALLY TRAINED TO DIRECTORS WHICH I POST IN MY ONLINE CLASS SO WHEN THEY GO TO THE TRAP RAISE THEY CAN SAY I AM A PROFESSIONALLY TRAINED TO OR DIRECTOR THIS IS WHAT I KNOW THEY CAN LIST OUT THEIR SKILLS AND IMMEDIATELY THEY HAVE THE ATTENTION OF THE TWO OR COMPANY AS COMPARED TO SOMEBODY AND NOT ANYTHING PERSONAL YOU PROBABLY MAKE A GREAT TOUR DIRECTOR BUT THAT SAYS I LOVE PEOPLE AND I LOVE TRAVEL

BALL COMES OFF THE RIBS ITS POSITION FIRST CONTACT FIRST TO MAKE SURE YOU FEEL THE OTHER GUY FIRST AND THEN YOU GO FOR THE BALL
BECAUSE THE BEAD WHEN IT GOES INTO THE KILN IT DOES NOT RISK GETTING INTO CONTACT WITH ELECTRODES THAT ARE LOCATED ABOUT BECAUSE THERE'S A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE UPPER CHAMBER AND THE BOTTOM CHAMBER
IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP CLOSE CONTACT WITH THESE PEOPLE AS THEY WILL BECOME GOOD CONTACTS FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
FEEL THE CONTACT OF THE PAN WITH THE PAPER
THE FIRST PART OF TAKING THIS PRINT OUT OF THE CONTACT PRINTER IS SQUEEGEEING THESE CLIPS IN THE BACK AND ALSO THAT
OR MAYBE IF YOU DIDN'T NEEDED PRESCRIPTION WITHOUT ANY CONTACT LENSES AT ALL
IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT PURCHASING COUNT COLORED CONTACT LENSES
TO ACTUALLY CATCHING A COLD VIRUS THOUGH YOU HAVE TO BE EXPOSED TO IT WHICH MEANS IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THROUGH CLOSE CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE THE VIRUS IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THROUGH NOT VERY SANITARY CONDITIONS WHERE YOUR TOUCHING THINGS THAT I'VE GERMS ON THEM STUFF LIKE THAT
SO MY OPPONENT IT TENDS TO BE MY BLADE AND I DISENGAGE BEFORE SHE MAKES CONTACT I'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND OF COURSE SINCE I HAVE MAINTAIN THAT RIGHT AWAY AND AVOID HER TEND TO TAKE IT FROM ME I WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT IMMEDIATELY WITH THE REST
SO IF YOUR OPPONENT TRIES TO BIND OR TO BEAT YOUR BLADE AND YOU SUCCESSFULLY AVOID CONTACT COMPLETELY WHILE MAINTAINING YOUR RIGHT OF WAY THEN YOU PULL OFF A SUCCESSFUL
THE LAST CLIP WE NOTED THE HAMMER OF MINT YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY A NOTE AND DRIVE YOUR FINGER OF YOUR FRETTING HAND INTO THE FRET BOARD AND THE FORCE OF YOUR FINGER IN THE STRING MAKING CONTACT WITH THE FRET WILL ALLOW THAT NEXT NOTE THE SECOND NOTE TO RING OUT
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A SMOOTH CLEAN CAUGHT CONTACT
WHEN YOU CONTACT THE PAPER YOU WANT TO ASK HIM TO COME OUT TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR JOB TO GIVE YOUR WRITTEN ESTIMATE SIGNED BY HIM
ESPECIALLY KEEP AN EYE OUT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY RUBBER WHERE MARKS THERE TO THAT WILL GIVE YOU AN IDEA THAT THE HARD PLASTIC AND NOT THE SOFT ROBBERIES MAKE CONTACT WITH THE BOTTOM
IF YOU DON'T FEEL ANY BUMPS OR RESISTANCE LIKE YOU DO HERE AND THAT MEANS THAT WELL IT'S NOT MAKING CONTACT WITH THE BOTTOM THE POOL AND THE BOTTOM OF THE PODS HERE MAYBE DOING THAT
ANY BIGGER IN THAT AND YOU GOT A FREE CAN NATURE ON YOUR HANDS I SUGGEST YOU CONTACT SOMEBODY ON MAKING SOME MONEY
