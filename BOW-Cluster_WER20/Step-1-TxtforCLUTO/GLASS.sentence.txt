AND THIS GOES FROM A NICE PRETTY BLUE COLOR TO A PURPLE COLOR THAT WE HAVE HIGH NOT TRY IT'S IN THE TANK WHICH IS JUST THE BETTER THE FISH AS WELL AS THE AMMONIA GLASS SENSE
JUST LIKE FILLING UP A GLASS OF WATER
ALSO TO CONSIDER HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE AVAILABLE ACCESSIBLE TO GO OUT THERE AND COLLECT SO JUST SOME GENERAL THINGS ABOUT COLLECTING IN RUBY GLASS FALLS INTO THAT SAME CAT
I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND GIVE YOU THE BIG INGREDIENTS TO MAKE THE BIG PUNCH THAT I MAKE IT IN A COCKTAIL GLASS YOU CAN SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
SO THIS IS ONE OF THE REAL GOOD CHANGES THAT'S OCCURRED IN THE AND THE FIBER GLASS AND RESIN FIELD ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT THE CLEANING A LOT OF THE PRODUCTS UP AND THEY'RE NOT THAT HARD POOL
A SET OF A GLASS AND POUR
YOUR GLASS FOR ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES SO COST ABOUT TWELVE DOLLARS HERE AT THE HU CUFF BUT IF YOU HAVE A BIG CREW SPLIT THAT COST MIKE'S MONDAY PEOPLE AND OS FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES SO PAST THE HOOP AROUND THOSE FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO VERY SOCIAL GETS KNOW PEOPLE THE COUPLE COCKTAILS IN YOU AND YOU WILL HAVE A BLAST STYLE
AND THEN WITH YOUR TIRE LEVER AND GO AROUND THE EDGE OF THE TIRE PULL THAT GAS OTHER THEN PULL YOUR TUBE OUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOT REMOVE YOUR TIRE BUT TAKE YOUR TWO OUT PUT SOME AIR IN YOUR TUBE AND THAT WILL ENABLE YOU TO GO AROUND THIS IS THE TUBE OR YOU CAN KIND OF FEEL WITH YOUR HAND OR LISTEN WITH YOUR EAR AND SEE IF YOU CAN FEEL A SMALL PUNCTURE OR HERE SOME AIR COMING OUT OR SPOT WHERE WHERE MAYBE BOULDERING WHERE THERE MAYBE SOMETHING STUCK IN THE TUBE WHICH IF YOU CAN FEEL ANYTHING SHARP OR SHE MAYBE ANY GLASS THAT MAY HAVE GONE THROUGH THE TIRE INTO THE TUBE
YOU CAN EITHER LAY YOUR PIECE OF GLASS ON TOP OF YOUR PATTERN THEREBY YOU'RE ABLE TO EITHER OUTLINE AND CUT YOUR PIECE LATER OR YOU CAN JUST CUT IT WITH YOUR TOOL
THERE ARE TWO WAYS THAT YOU CAN USE YOUR PATTERN TO BENEFIT YOU AND YOUR GLASS CONSTRUCTION
THERE WE GO AND MIX THAT UP AND LAST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS GO AND POUR THIS IN THE GLASS AND WE'RE GOING TO FLOAT OR SOME EVER CLEAR ON TOP WHICH IS GOING TO BE AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE PROOF AND CAN GO ALL THE WAY UP TO A HUNDRED EIGHTY PROOF SO IF YOU FLOAT THAT ON TOP OF FULL SHOT AND WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THIS IS IF YOU WANT YOU CAN LIGHT THAT ON FIRE AND FIND SOME WAY OF DRINKING IT
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN PRINTING FOR THE CONTACT PRINTER OR A PIECE OF GLASS THAT HAS SCRATCHES INTER ALL OVER
I CAN SEE PARTS OF THE ROOM HERE IN THE GLASS AS WELL AS ON THE THE STAINLESS STEEL OF THIS PARTICULAR WATCH
A CERAMIC KILN AND THEORETICALLY B IS FOR MAKING GLASS BEADS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE SUPER CAREFUL NOT TO INTRODUCE THE GLUTE THE METAL ROD THAT YOU MAKE THE BEAD ON INTO ANY OF THE ELECTRIC ELEMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE COUNT
BUT IN ANY OF THAT THE KNEELING KILN IT'S A FOR THEIR HOMOGENIZING INFLUENCE ON THE GLASS AND HELPS ENSURE THAT THE GLASS BEAD THAT YOU MAKE ONCE IT COMES DOWN TO ROOM TEMPERATURE WILL NOT CRACK
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO USE FIRM TOFU OH I THINK IT THIS IS ACTUALLY EXTRA FROM WHICH IS EVEN BETTER BECAUSE WHEN IT IF YOU USE SOMETHING THAT'S GLASS FIRM IT'S JUST GOING TO BREAK UP ONCE YOUR SUIT COMES TO A BOIL
FEEL FREE TO RIM THE RIM YOUR GLASS WITH THE SUGAR IF YOU'D LIKE AND FOR THIS AND THERE WE GO AND GIVE IT A STRAW AND THERE YOU GO BOTTOMS UP
AND LET'S SET UP A GLASS
RIGHT NOW I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF GLASS THAT SEEM VERY SIMILAR
WE'RE HERE PICKING ON OUR COLORS OF GLASS CENTER TEXTURES OF GLASS TODAY FOR ONE OF OUR PROJECT
THE FIRST ONE WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT TODAY IS OUR TEAC GLASS
WHEN THE PIECES HITTING THE SUGAR IN MAKING ALCOHOL IT'S ALSO CREATING SEALER TO AND EVEN IF THE CEO TO IS NOT PURPOSELY CAPTURED IN THE CLASS A LITTLE BIT REMAINS IN THE WIND AND WILL REMAIN IN THE BOTTLE AND WILL REMAIN IN YOUR WINE GLASS
THEY MIGHT ALSO KIND OF STICK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE GLASS AND MAYBE KIND OF BE RANDOMLY RANDOMLY KIND OF STUFF THROUGHOUT THE BOTTOM OF THE GLASS OR YOU MIGHT HAVE EVEN A LITTLE BIT OF THIS AND THIS IS AN A WINE THAT'S A STILL WINE EVEN A VERY STURDY RED WINE
SO A MARTINI GLASS IS READY
THE GLASS AND MY RIGHT HAND CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS THE PAINT AND I AM DOING THE APPLYING OF THE PAINT OR THE HOT GLASS BELOW THE FLAME
NOTICE NOW ONCE I APPLIED ON MY GLASS I AM IN THE FLAME
WE'RE GOING TO START OFF BY FEELING A GLASS ABOUT HALFWAY WITH ICE JUST LIKE THAT
THE REASON I WOULD NOT WANT AMOUNT OF PHOTO IS IF IT IS AN ORIGINAL OR IF I WAS PLANNING I'M PUTTING IT UNDER GLASS OR A OR IF THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE BACK OF THIS POSTER FOR SOME REASON THAT I DID NOT WANT TO COVER THIS UP ESPECIALLY ORIGINALS IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO MOUNT ON A POSTER
SO I'LL FILL THAT UP AND THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH ONE FIFTY ONE TO A REALLY SET UP A VOLCANO AND WE'LL MIX IN HALF A GLASS OF COLA IT AND IT'S GOING TO MIX THIS UP HERE ALSO DO THE JUICE OF HALF OF A LIME SO IF YOU JUST GRAB A FEW LIME WEDGES AND SQUEEZE THOSE IN
AND FIRST THING WE'LL DO IS PUT SOME ICE IN A GLASS HERE AND WE WILL DO ONE SHOT OF OR I'M SORRY I'M GOING TO DO BELIEVE IT OR NOT A FULL HALF A GLASS OF ONE FIFTY ONE
WE IS A LOT OF HOMEMADE AT CLEANING SUPPLIES THINGS THAT WE PUT TOGETHER AND USE YOU KNOW FOR GLASS CLEANER FOR INSTANCE I USE A MIXTURE OF VINEGAR DISH SOAP AND WATER AND I HAVE TRIED ALL SORTS OF GLASS CLEANERS AND NOTHING WORKS BETTER THAN THIS AND SO WE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE JUST OVER TIME TRY AND YOU KNOW TRIAL AND ERROR TYPE THINGS THAT WE HAVE FOUND THAT WORK BEST FOR YOU KNOW FOR CLEANING THAT MAY BE IS UNCONVENTIONAL SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT USING AND WE USE THAT FOR YOU KNOW GENERAL CLEANING AS WELL COUNTER TOPS AND STAINLESS STEEL AND IT LEAVES A REALLY A SPARKLING SHINE AND NO STREAKS AND IT'S REALLY AWESOME
SO THAT'S THE PIE RAW MATTER AND THIS IS MY BEAD KILN AND AGAIN THESE ARE AVAILABLE FOR MANY OF THE GLASS SUPPLY HOUSES
WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO SERVE IT AS A SHOTS YOU CAN ALSO JUST SERVE IT OVER ROCKS AND YOU CAN STRAIN IT INTO YOUR SHOT GLASS JUST LIKE THAT
GO AHEAD AND PUT YOUR ICE IN YOUR GLASS AND START OUT WITH
AND THE WATER PORTION HOW SOME OF THE GLASS TO VERY WELL WATER IN WHICH IS VERY GLASS OF WATER
YOU CAN WORK YOURSELF UP TO THAT BY DRINKING EIGHT GLASSES A WATER A DAY AND THEN MOVING UP TO SIXTEEN GLASS OF WATER AND THEN TWENTY FOUR AND THEN YOU'LL BE A THREE LEADERS
ON BEHALF OF EXPERT <UNK> MY NAME IS ALLISON AT WESTERN ART GLASS
CLEAN THE GLASS
AND IN THE LAST STEP I SHOWED YOU HOW TO GRIND YOUR ART GLASS TO FIT TO THE SIZE YOUR PATTERN A PILLOW PAPER PATTERN OFF AT THIS POINT
I HAVE PLATES A GLASS OF FLOWERS AND DECORATIONS AND LINENS AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO SET THE TABLE
GRAB A HIGHBALL GLASS OR A SHOT GLASS
AND I DECIDE GLUE STICK IS GOING TO WORK BEST FOR THIS PROJECT BECAUSE YOU ARE USING GLASS AND THIS RIBBON OF MATERIAL AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO WORK BEST
LET'S GO AHEAD AND PUT SOME ICE IN OUR GLASS HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO MEASURE OUT TWO OUNCES OF IRISH CREAM
GO AHEAD AND START OFF BY PUTTING YOUR ICE IN YOUR GLASS LIKE SO
LET'S GET OUR GLASS AND GIVE IT A POUR AND THERE WE GO
YOU DON'T WANT BIG GAPS IN YOUR GLASS

I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE IT JUST AS ONE DRINK OK FIRST OFF FILL IN A GLASS WITH ICE AND MEASURE OUT ONE SHOT OF DARK RUM
SANITIZER AT THIS POINT THE BREWING PROCESS YOU NEED TO CLEAN ALL OF YOUR EQUIPMENT BUT IN PARTICULAR YOU NEED TO SANITIZE WHICH IS THE ACTUAL OF CLEANING YOUR PRIMARY FERMENTER IF YOU ACTUALLY GO WITH THE GLASS CARBOY NEEDED TO SANITIZE YOUR FILTER AS WELL AS LONG AS YOUR AS WELL AS YOUR AIR LOCK YOUR RUBBER STOPPERS AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT WILL BE TOUCHING THE BEER AFTER IT HAS GONE CALLED
NOW AS MELISSA INCREASES RIGHT HER ABILITY TO STRIKE OR SPEED AND POWER RIGHT WHAT I'LL DO IS THE HAND COMES DOWN A LITTLE BIT HARDER NEXT ONE IS A MEET THE HAND OKAY MEETING THE GLASS
HERE IN UTAH IT'S TWENTY DEGREES OUTSIDE CURRENTLY AND SO WE'RE GOING TO NEED FOR WHAT I'M USING IS ONCE YOU WATCH THE ICE THERE AND YOU CAN DEPENDING ON HOW COLD IT IS YOU CAN MIX THIS WITH WATER BUT I LIKE SOME PROJECT NEED TO USE IT STRAIGHT SO THAT YOUR WATER DOESN'T FREEZE UP ON THE GLASS
PRETEND YOU'RE POUR IN A LITTLE A LITTLE LIKE A SHOT GLASS OF COOL LATER SOMETHING BETWEEN EACH LETTER AND YOU WANT TO BE THE SAME AMOUNT
YOU CAN FIND DIFFERENT HURRICANES A DIFFERENT GLASS CONTAINERS IN LOCAL DISCOUNT STORES
FIRST THING WE'LL DO IS PUT SOME ICE IN A GLASS AND WE'VE GOT A MARTINI GLASS READY TO GO YOU WANT TO GET THIS CHILLED
WE'RE GOING TO START OFF WITH OUR ICE POUR THAT INTO YOUR GLASS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO ADD IN ONE OUNCE OF LIGHT RUM MOVE MOVE MOVE JUST LIKE SO
ALRIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO SHAKE THIS UP AND WE'RE GOING TO STRAIN THIS INTO A MARTINI GLASS AND JUST LET THIS FOR AND THERE YOU HAVE IT
SOMETIMES THEY'RE SHARP LITTLE PIECES OF GLASS SOMETIMES THERE'S ROOTS SOMETIMES OR SOMETHING IN THAT SOIL THAT MAY TEND TO CATCH IT
AND YOU THAT OUT THERE WE GO AND LET'S MIX ALL THESE INGREDIENTS UP TO THIS WILL BE NICE AND COLD STRAIN IT IN YOUR MARTINI GLASS SERVE IT UP
ONE OF THE OILS TOUCH ON THE GLASS TO GET THEM
YOU KNOW OR A CLASSIC GLASS OR GLASS IN IT WITHIN A GLASS OF DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT ONE
SOMETIMES YOU CAN SEE ANYTHING SOMETIMES JUST OVER THEM THE MYSTERY WHOLE DON'T KNOW HOW GOT THERE BUT IF YOU ARE ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN THEN DO IS USE YOUR OF YOUR VALVE STEM AS A REFERENCE SO YOU WOULD FIND YOUR RIM WHERE THE WHERE THE VALVE HOLE IS AND THEN BASED ON WHERE THE HOLE IS IN RELATION TO THE VALVE STEM A FINE THAT SAME SPOT AND YOUR TIRE SO YOU CAN GO ALONG YOUR TIRE MAYBE IF YOU SEE PIECE OF GLASS SORE THORN OR A LITTLE BARRED FROM A BLACKBERRY BUSH SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND GO AHEAD AND PICK IT OUT
YOU REALLY CAN'T SEE THAT PROBABLY ON THE CAMERA BECAUSE LIKE I SAID I'M USING THAT ON DART GLASS
AND SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT I GET A NICE STRAIGHT YOU KNOW LINE I'M JUST ON ALL JUST USE A PIECE OF GLASS THAT I KNOW ALREADY HAS A STRAIGHT EDGE
FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS ADD SOME ICE TO A GLASS
SO ON THE NEXT STEP I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO START CUTTING YOUR ART GLASS
THEY MUST TO HAVE THE FUZZY AFFECT THE BOTTOM AND IF I HAD TO DO NINE GLARE I'D PROBABLY DO A PIKE SAVE OVER THE GLASS IS A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEAR IT GIVES YOU A BATTER LOOK IN YOUR PICTURE
LET'S PUT SOME ICE IN A GLASS AND MEASURE OUT TWO SHOTS OF DRY GIN PREFERABLY BORDEN'S DRIED GIN HENCE THE FLASH GORDON BUT ANY GIN WILL DO
THEN WHEN YOU GO TO THE BAR GO AND ASK FOR A FLASH BORDEN OR IN A GLASS AND WE'RE GOING TO GARNISH IT WITH A LIME ADD A STRAW AND BOTTOMS UP
SO LET'S PUT SOME ICE IN A GLASS HERE AND WE'LL DO ONE SHOT OF TEQUILA
CURRY IS CAN RANGE FROM VERY MILD TO VERY SUBTLE FLAVOR ALL THE WAY UP TO THE KIND THAT YOU JUST WANT TO GRAB A GLASS OF ICE WATER THAT'S FIERY HOT
LINKS AND I'M GOING TO RETURN THESE PIECES TO THIS SAME BALL MOVEMENT AND THIS IS A PIRATES TYPE BOWL WITH THE GLASS COVER JUST FOR MARINATING BRIDGE
LET'S PUT OUR ICE IN A GLASS HERE
SET UP OUR GLASS AND POUR IT IN AND GIVE IT A STRAW AND GARNISH IT WITH A LEMON
THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE LARGE ROCK STRUCTURE SITTING ON GRAVEL LIKE POSSIBLY MOVE BECAUSE THE ROCKS OR TO FALL OVER AND BREAK THE GLASS OR THE AQUARIUM BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE TO BUY HOLD THE AQUARIUM AND YOU HAVE A MESS TO CLEAN UP AS WELL
NOW ONE OF THE THINGS I JUST WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING JUST AND IN GENERAL LOG COLLECTING AND WE'RE TALKING RIGHT NOW SPECIFICALLY ABOUT COLLECTING THE GLASS
GO AHEAD AND PUT THAT GLASS AND IN ON THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR DOOR
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SIDE WITH THAT CONVEX GLASS IS ON THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR DOOR
THIS IS A SHOT SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A SHOT GLASS HANDY TAKE YOUR STRAINER YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE WITH YOU POUR IT IN A NICE PRETTY BLUE COLOR
NOW YOU GOT CURVED WINDOWS HERE IT'S TYPICALLY GLASS
NOW WE GO LIGHTER WITH GLASS SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE COLORS AND PUT THEM ON HER KIND OF SEE WHICH ONES WE LIKE THE BEST
BUT IT GETS THAT TEMPERATURE HIGH ENOUGH AND IN THE CASE OF THE THAT FAT TRAY ITALIAN THAT'S WE'RE USING NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT GETS THE GLASS HOT ENOUGH SO THAT THE MOLECULES IN THE BEAD FORM GET TO VIBRATE AND KIND OF MOVE A LITTLE BIT
WHERE THE GLASS MOLECULES GET TO VIBRATE
AND IT ALSO IMPORTANTLY PERFORMS THE FUNCTION OF A KNEELING THE BEAD ANNEALING AS THE PROCESS OF MAKING HAPPY GLASS MOLECULES
NOW WHEN YOU'RE PAINTING ON GLASS YOU HAVE TO KIND OF THINK IN REVERSE BECAUSE WHATEVER COLOR YOU PUT ON FIRST THAT'S GOING TO BE SEEN FIRST
HI I'M DAVID CLEMEN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO PAINT A PIECE OF GLASS INSIDE OF THE FRAME
SO NOW SO I'M GOING TO START WITH AND WHEN YOU PAINT WITH ACRYLIC ON GLASS YOU DON'T WANT TO USE ANY WATER ON THE PAINT BECAUSE IT TENDS TO STREAK IF YOU PUT WATER ON IT AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO IT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO HELP YOUR PAINTING AT ALL
IT'S GOING TO PUT SOME ICE IN A GLASS AND MEASURE OUT ONE OUNCE OF AVOCADO BRANDY
IT'S MESMERIZING AND THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THE PART OF THE BEAUTY OF GLASS BEAD MAKING A FUN AND SEEING THE COLORS CHAINS AND THE SHAPE COME TO LIFE RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES
IT DEPENDS ON WHO ARE WHO IS IN THE GLASS AND TEACHING THE CLASS AND THAT'S PART OF FUN INTEGRATE SCHOOL
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO POUR IT IN A GLASS OF ICE ACTUALLY
SO IN THIS EXAMPLE I'M GOING TO USE A GLASS OF WINE RED WINE AS YOU CAN SEE
SET UP A GLASS AND POUR IT IN
SO THOSE THAT'S JUST SOME TIPS ON HOW TO PURCHASE A GLASS CONTAINER AND FIND THE RIGHT CONTAINER FOR YOUR DO IT YOURSELF GARDEN THEME WEDDING CENTER PIECE
AND LET'S GET A GLASS
WHAT WE JUST DID HERE WAS SCENT SOME OF THAT SANITIZER AND ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF BEER OFF INTO OUR GLASS HERE AND QUICKLY POINT THAT SIPHON ONCE AND FILL THE BEER THAT WAS PRIMED MOVE THE TWO OVER TO OUR GLASS CARBOY AND NOW WE'RE TRANSFERRING

I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PLUG THEM TO THAT TUBING WITH MY THUMB AND REMOVE THIS WHOLE THING PLACE OR RACKING CAME DOWN INTO OUR GEAR TAKE YOUR GLASS AND GO AHEAD AND LOWER IT TOWARDS THE FLOOR AND NOTICE THAT I STILL HAVE MY RACKING CANE FULL OF SANITIZER HERE AND MY THUMB IS THE ONLY THING HOLDING THIS SANITIZER INSIDE THE RACKING CANE THAT'S IMPORTANT
IN THIS CLIP WE'LL BE TRANSFERRING FROM OUR PRIMARY FERMENTER HERE INTO OUR SECONDARY GLASS FERMENTER
LOOK THROUGH THE BOAT MAKE SURE YOUR GLASS IS CLEAN
AND THAT NINE GLARE IN BITES LIGHT IN WHICH DAMAGE IS YOU WANT IT PLEXIGLASS GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT CLEARED FOR PICTURE THEN THE GLASS NINE GLARE THOUGHT
THIRTY FORTY YEARS AGO WE WERE ALL TAHT NINE GLARE GLASS IS THE BEST PRODUCT IN THE WORLD FOR YOUR PRODUCT IT SINCE THEN WE HAVE LEARNED OTHERWISE
SMALL SHAKER TEN GOING INDICATORS AND TELLS YOU CAN SHAKE AND DRYING AND NOT BREAKING GLASS WHATEVER
AND GET YOUR GLASS AND POUR IT IN AND ADD A STRAW AND YOU WILL BE FLIPPING IN NO TIME BOTTOMS UP
I LIKE THE GLASS ONES PREFERABLY
THE CLAM SHELL IS JUST LIKE THE REVERSE OF A CLAMSHELL BUT IT'S IN THE GLASS THIS WAY LIKE A CLEAN WITH LEAVE IN THE SAND
AT THIS POINT THE BREWING PROCESS YOU NEED TO CLEAN ALL OF YOUR EQUIPMENT BUT IN PARTICULAR IF YOU NEED TO SANITIZE WHICH IS THE ACTUAL OF CLEANING YOUR PRIMARY FERMENTER IF YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO TO THE GLASS CARBOY NEEDED TO SANITIZE YOUR FILTER AS WELL
WE'VE GOT A GARDEN GLASS OR DISPOSABLE GLOVES YOUR CHOICE THAT WILL PROTECT YOUR HANDS
AND FIRST THING WE'LL DO IS PUT SOME ICE IN A GLASS HERE WE'RE GOING TO MEASURE OUT ONE SHOT OF CASA NOBODY TEQUILA
AND GET A GLASS OBVIOUSLY IF YOU HAVE A MARGARITA GLASS TO INSTALL THE RIM YOU CAN DO THAT OR YOU CAN JUST SERVE IT UP ANY KIND OF GLASS YOU HAVE AVAILABLE
AND WE'RE GOING TO STRAIN EVERYTHING INTO A COCKTAIL GLASS AND PRETTY MUCH SERVE IS A SHOT AND GIVE A STRAW IF YOU WANT
YOUR GLASS
AND SO I'VE GOT BOTH OF THESE PATTERNS LINED UP ON THE GLASS
SO I'M TRYING TO BE SOMEWHAT ECONOMICAL WITH MY GLASS SO I LIKE TO GET AS MANY PIECES OUT OF IT AS I CAN
DRAW A LINE ON MY GLASS GOING THIS WAY AND THEN I'M GOING TO CUT THAT PIECE
AND YOU KNOW IF I HAVE A HARD TIME SEEM TO BE IN A SHARPIE GETS A DARK PIECE OF GLASS LIKE YOU NEED TO USE A PASTEL OR GREASE PENCIL
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO UNDERSTAND AND THAT YOU JUST HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE BALL WHEN YOU'RE IN A CERTAIN POSITION AND YOU PUT THE BALL UP THEIR OFF OF THE GLASS IT'S GOING OFF A COME IN AND BOUNCE INTO THE TO THE RIM NOW TURN THERE'S MANY
