BASICALLY WE'RE JUST USING THEM SLICED BASIC SLICE NOW OUR ONIONS THE BOTTOM PORTION OF OUR GREEN ONIONS WILL GO INTO THE RECIPE IN AN EARLIER POINT THEN TOPS WHICH WE'RE ALSO GOING TO USE
SO WE'RE GOING TO USE IN THIS RECIPE WE'RE GOING TO USE A REGULAR BROWN ONION AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO USE SOME GREEN ONION ALSO

SOME OTHER THE CHALLENGES TRIVIA CARD CHALLENGES THERE ARE THREE OF THEM THERE'S THE TAKE THREE CHALLENGE THAT'S IN GREEN SONGS AND SLOGANS CHALLENGE AND POP CULTURE CHALLENGE
LOOK AT THIS GREEN STRIP INTERIOR NIGHT JUST LIKE THE COLORS THAT WE ASSIGNED THE STRAPS
YOU ALSO MAY HAVE A PERSON WHO'S A LITTLE MORE RED OR A LITTLE MORE SWELLING UNDER THE EYES SO THAT USUALLY WILL BE RIGHT UNDER THE LASH LINE THE LOWER LASH LINE SO YOU WOULD WANT TO USE A GREEN BASE THERE
BUT IN AMERICA WE CALL A GREEN LAND
IT HAS A GREEN STRIPE WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CREAM AND THEN PINK EDGES
I'M GOING TO CHANGE THAT TO A GREEN
AND THE GREEN COLOR IS RED SO IT'S GOING TO GO FROM CREAM TO READ
AND THEN THAT IF YOU USE THE GREEN A FILTER EFFECT SKIN TONES AND LIPS WILL LOOK REALLY GOOD BECAUSE THEY'RE RED AND AND THE GREEN IS THE OPPOSITE OF RED SO IT MAKES THOSE STICK OUT A LITTLE DARKER A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTRAST AND THEN THAT TREE LEAVES AND STUFF LIKE THAT WILL LOOK AT BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME COLOR IS GREEN

IT COSTS YOU A BLACK TO PLAY AND WHAT THIS DOES IS THAT IT DESTROYS TARGET GREEN OR WHITE CREATURE
NOW ONCE AGAIN THIS DESTRUCTION IS A DESTRUCTIVE EFFECT IT'S NOT DAMAGE SO IT CANNOT BE PREVENTED AND THAT CREATURE CAN NOT BE REGENERATED BECAUSE IT SAYS DESTROYED AND DESTROY TARGET GREEN OR WHITE CREATURE
WELL THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO TAKE THE BOWL OFF THE CUISINARTS AND BRING IT OVER TO THE BALL THAT YOU HAVE A MAZZARELLA HIM AND REMOVE ALL OF THE CHEESE WHICH IS NOW SLIGHTLY TINTED GREEN FROM THAT FRESH BASIL WHICH IS REALLY GREAT IT AND THEN ON OUR NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO PUT IT ON OUR BAGUETTE SLICES WHICH ARE PURPOSE TEENY I PUT IT ON FAIRLY THICK LIKE THIS MOUNTING IT AND GETTING IT ABSOLUTELY TO EVERY EDGE OF THE BAG OUT
JUST KEEP PLAYING WITH IT HAVE FUN AND AND DON'T LET IT IF YOU START HAVING PROBLEMS WITH IT IS COGS UP TAKE A MOMENT PULLING YOU'LL OUT CLEAN IT UP OR PAIN OUT AND JUST GIVE IT JUST TO A LIGHT GREEN
