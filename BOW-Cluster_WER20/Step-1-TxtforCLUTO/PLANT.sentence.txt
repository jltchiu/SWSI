SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THE MOTHER PLANT JUST MAKES MORE ROOTS AND MAKES THE BABY
THE CLOSER NEVER DIFFERENT GENETICALLY THAN THE MOTHER PLANT
NOW THIS WITH DOWN THIS PLANT CONE ELEVEN WENT DOWN A LITTLE BIT SO WE REALLY GOT THIS PRETTY HOT
NOW THE NEXT THING WOULD BE TO FILL IN THE REST OF THE PLANT
THEN I'M GOING TO SET THE PLANT BACK IN THE HOLE
THEY DON'T NEED A BOY INTEGRAL PLANT TO MAKE BABIES
IF YOU'VE GOT THE APPLE PRO CARE PROTECTION PLANT IN GO AHEAD AND CALL THEM AFTER AT THE NUMBER OR VISIT THEM THROUGH THEIR INTERFACE APPLE DOT COM
IT'S BEEN RUMORED AND A LEDGE THAT THIS PLANT CAN HELP WITH SOME MEDICAL OF WOES AS WELL
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO PICK OUT AND PLANT THE FRESH EGGPLANT
SO IF YOU HAD A IF YOU HAD A A C THAT WAS THE AS BIG AS MY THUMB YOU WANT TO PLANT IT ABOUT THAT BEAT
ORDINARY WHEN YOU PLANT SEEDS THE RULE OF THUMB IS TO PLANT THE SEED THREE TIMES THE THICKNESS OF THE SEAT
ONCE YOU GET IT IN CONTACT WITH SOIL IF YOU HAVE GOOD SOIL TO TO SEE CONTACT YOU PUT MOISTURE ON IT THE SEED SHOULD GERMINATE UNDER THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE CONDITION SHOULD GERMINATE INFORM NEW PLANT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF THE GROUND
NEXT BEGIN AT THE END OUR BOTTOM OF THE PLANT AND BEGIN UNRAVELING
SO WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR TOOLS CLEAN BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU MAKE A CUT ON THE PLANT YOU OPEN IT UP OR DISEASE
THESE LOOK A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE TOUGHER STUFF ON IT TO TAKE ON JUST SOME WATER AND ADD SOME BLEACH OR ANOTHER DISINFECTANT LIKE ABOUT TEN PERCENT AND I COULD SO THESE TOOLS FOR ABOUT FIVE OR TEN MINUTES AND THEY'LL BE NICE AND CLEAN FOR ONE I WANT TO USE ON THIS WHEN I'M DONE JUST TRY IT OFF BECAUSE THE PLANT THEY DON'T LIKE DISINFECTANT THAT ONLY BLEACH SO THAT NOW THERE SHOULD BE CLEAN AND SANITARY PRESCIENT
AND THE IDEA ABOUT THIS IS TO KEEP THE WATER CENTERED ON THE PLANT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE WORKING ON A SLOPE LIKE THIS ONE
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS RIGHT AFTER WE PLANTED OUR PLANT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OURSELVES A LITTLE EARTHEN DAM FEW INCHES DEEP SO THAT THE WATER THAT WE PUT IN HERE AT THE BASE OF THE PLANT STAYS HERE
REMEMBER MOST IT'S JUST WASH OFF EVERY TIME YOU WATER THE PLANT SO PERHAPS WE'RE NOT MAINTAINING THAT MOISTURE THAT WE NEED OR PERHAPS WE CUT TOO MUCH MOISTURE
YOU ONLY NEED ONE OF THEM SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS HOP ON TOP AND ONE TWO WITH THE BOOK WILL BE A PLANT
AND IF YOU DO YOU CAN SUFFOCATE YOUR PLANT
SO YOU HAVE TO USE A HIGH DECELERATED NITROGEN LIKE AN EIGHTEEN SIX TWELVE NINETEEN FIVE NINE OR TWENTY ONE SEVEN FOURTEEN EVERY TWO TO THREE WEEKS THROUGHOUT THE GROWING SEASON JUST PUT IT ON THE SIDE OF THE PLANT AND WATERED IN REAL WELL
ALL YOU HAVE ONE ON THE TOP THAT ALLOWS YOU TO KIND OF BRING YOUR TOES TOGETHER AND POINT THEM UP OKAY DORSI PLANT THEM
SO THE INTERESTING IS ALL IN BETWEEN THE TOES OKAY ALL IN THERE ALL BETWEEN EVERY TOE THERE'S INTERESTING OKAY YOU HAVE A DORSAL WHICH IS LIKE DORSAL FLEXION AND PLANT OUR FLEXION
IT'S A PLANT THAT ACTUALLY GETS TO BE FAIRLY LARGE
NOW YOU'LL NORMALLY BITE AS A FAIRLY SMALL PLANT TO START OFF AS A LITTLE SEEDLING OR YOU CAN ACTUALLY STARTED FROM SEED
I DO HOWEVER RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONSULT A DOCTOR AND MAKE SURE THAT IT GOES ALONG WITH YOUR PLANT
YOU GO THROUGH THE WHOLE BUSINESS PLANT IN YOUR HEAD AND YOU WRITE THINGS DOWN AND YOU HAVE A GREAT BUSINESS PLAN IN IN MIND AND YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU TAKE IT FROM BEING ON PAPER TO ACTUALLY YOU KNOW OPENING THE BUSINESS AND STARTING TO WORK
WHETHER IT'S A SUN PLANT OR SHADE PLANT IS GOING TO DO WELL IN THE NORTHWEST
THIS PLANT I ACTUALLY HAD ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO I TRIED DIVIDING THE CORNER OF IT TO GIVE IT TO A FRIEND OF MINE AND I KILLED MY NEVER CAME BACK SO MY DO YOUR FRIEND AND SHE IS THIS YEAR GAVE ME THIS PLANT THAT YOU START
LET'S GO TO PLANT
AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE HAVE INDIVIDUAL PLANT AND PULL OUT SOME OF THESE WEEDS OR YOU ALWAYS HAVE WEEDS
SO WE TAKE THE MOSS AND PUT IT IN AROUND LETTUCE PLANT
BY DOING THAT OF COURSE YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD PLANT FOR YOUR BACK YOUR GARDEN
OFTEN WITH HERBS YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP PICKING OFF THAT NEW GROWTH AND THE MORE YOU PICK THE MORE THE LATERAL BUDS WILL SPREAD YOU'LL GET A MUCH BUSH YOUR PLANT AND YOU'LL GET A PLANT THE LAST A LOT LONGER
IT'LL FLOWER AND THEN THE PLANT SOMETIMES STARTS TO SHUT DOWN
ONE INITIALLY PLANT
YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO CHOOSE A MUCH LARGER PLANT WITH A LARGER LEAF LIKE LET'S SAY THIS ONE AND YOU'RE GOING TO CUT OFF THE YELLOWING TIPS BUT YOU'RE GOING TO CUT THEM OFF IT AWAY THAT KEEPS THE PLANT LEAF SHAPE
SO THIS IS A PRETTY SMALL PLANT TO BE DOING THIS ON
LOOK AT THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THE PLANT IS BRAND NEW AND DRIVING
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE PLANT IT DOESN'T HAVE YELLOWING LEAVES
IT DOESN'T HURT THE PLANT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HELP THE PLANT BUT IT HELPS YOUR PIECE OF MINE
A LONG IT TAKES FOR THEM TO MATURE AND WHETHER TO PLANT THEM IN FULL SUN
IF YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR INJURY IT'S ADVISABLE THAT YOU DEFINITELY FOLLOW THE PLANT THAT YOUR DOCTOR HAS OR YOUR PHYSICAL THERAPIST HAS
YOU DON'T WANT TO PLANT IT GOING
THEY'RE OVER SIX BILLION PEOPLE ON THIS PLANT AND IF YOU'RE SITTING HOME ALONE SHAVE ON YOU
AS I LAND MY WEIGHT STILL COMES HERE I SHIFT FORWARD INTO THE PUNCH AND THEN AS I PLANT THE ARM BACK I THROW THE RIGHT LEG OUT
THE MOST SAFE PURE INGREDIENTS ARE PLANT OILS
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO FIRST I'M GOING TO PLANT MY FEET IN THE GROUND AND THEN I'M GOING TO REACH MY SHOULDERS DOWN AND REACH OUT WITH MY HAND AND REACH DOWN WITH MY RIGHT HAND AND OUT
WE ALSO WANT TO MY LITTLE ALLIGATOR JAW PLANT THAT WAS THERE
BUT THE PLANT ISN'T THAT NO DIFFERENT FLOWERS IT'S NOT AS CHORD SHAPE AND BECAUSE OF THAT THIS IS THE ONE PLANT YOU DON'T DIVIDE
ANOTHER REALLY INTERESTING PLANT IS THIS VERY SMALL SEE THEM
BUT I THINK TRYING TO CUT IT IN HALF YOU DISTURB THE PLANT AND THAT'S WHEN I KILLED MINE SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PLANTS YOU'LL HAVE TO TREAT A LITTLE MORE WITH A TENDER LOVING CARE
YOU KNOW IF YOU JUST HAVE A PLANT TAKE CARE OF WRITTEN WATER IT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO LOOK THE BEST THAT I CAN
SO WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO GRAB A PLANT HERE ARE SOME TOOLS THAT YOU'LL NEED A PAIR OF SCISSORS OR SOME SORT OF CLOTH TO MAYBE WIPE OFF THE DIRT OF THE PLANT IF THERE'S A LOT OF DIRT CAKED ON AND A LITTLE FEATHER DUSTER BECAUSE SOMETIMES IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF PLANTS IN THEIR INDOORS ESPECIALLY IN THERE IF THEY'RE IN A PUBLIC PLACE THEY'RE GOING TO GET A LOT OF DUST ALL OVER THEM
IT'S REALLY EASY DOESN'T EVEN TAKE ANY THOUGHT WHATSOEVER I PUT A LAYER DUSTER I TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THE PLANT
BUT FOR MORE PRACTICAL STANDPOINT WE DO LIKE OUR SWEETENERS AND SO IN GENERAL I RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE YOU STAY VIA IN PARTICULAR FROM A NATURAL PERSPECTIVE GROW THE PLANT YOURSELF AND USE THE FRESH LEAF
TODAY I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU A GROOMING YOUR PLANT
THE BEST THING TO DO A PLANT THAT SCALE OCCURS IS JUST TAKE CARE OF IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
SO FROM HERE FOR THE AND IT CAN BE A STRIKE IF YOU WANT TO PLANT OR IT CAN JUST BE GUIDING IT THROUGH

HOSTAS OR A BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL SHADE PLANT BECAUSE THEY'LL GROW SO EASILY IN THE SHADE
BASICALLY THEY COME AS A ROOT WITH PART OF A STEM AND WHEN YOU DIVIDE THEM OUT THAT'S ALL YOU NEED IS PART OF A RUDE WITH THE STEM AND SO YOU JUST PLANT IT ABOUT SOMETHING ABOUT THREE INCHES DEEP SO THE STEM IS BARELY OUT OF THE GROUND
AND THEN WITH YOUR RIGHT FOOT TO RIGHT IF YOU'RE RIGHT HANDED PUT YOUR RIGHT FOOT DOWN AS A PLANT FOOT
AND IF YOU KEEP CHECKING ON IT I'VE FOUND YOUR GERANIUMS WILL GROW QUITE QUICKLY AND WITHIN A MONTH WILL HAVE A WHOLE ANOTHER PLANT
AND WHEN YOU ARE NOT PLANT THEM IN ANY KIND OF BAD SOIL
THE LARGER GAMES WHEN YOU PLANT IT GETS A LARGE AREA RIVALS' OR GAMES WE'RE GOING TO BE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OR A HUGE CROWD OR IN A HUGE FROM BEING YOU ADD A HUGE VENUE YOU WANT TO REALLY DO YOUR BEST JUST TO SHOW WHOEVER IS THERE THAT YOU'RE WORTH YOUR WORK THEIR TIME AND EFFORT
THESE ARE THE TOOLS THAT WE NEED FOR THE JOB TO PLANT JAPANESE BOXWOOD

WE'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO PLANT SHOT
CACTUS OR CACTI IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE PLANT GROW NATURALLY IN THE DESERT
COMMON PROBLEM PEOPLE GET OVER ENTHUSIASTIC BAIT PLANT TOO MANY SEED
SO TO EACH LITTLE CLOVES JUST LIKE A GARLIC WILL MAKE ITS OWN PLANT
AND IT'LL BE A IDENTICALLY GENETIC TO THE MOTHER PLANT
EVERY LITTLE CELL JUST A FINGERNAIL SCRATCHING OF THAT PLANT HAS ALL THE DIFFERENT MAKEUP FOR IT
I'M GOING TO PLANT THE BUSINESS UNDER THE PADDLE IN THE WATER I'M GOING TO ROTATE BACKWARDS AND WATCH THAT PADDLE BLADE

WHAT YOU WANT TO DO A PLANT THAT END OF THE PADDLE IN THE WATER I'M GOING TO LOCK MIGHT PICK NECK IN MY HEAD ON MY SHOULDERS SO WHEN MY NECK MOVES TO WATCH THAT PADDLE BLADE MY WHOLE BODY IS GOING TO MOVE
WITH THE WEIGHTS ARE FREE WEIGHTS HANGING RIGHT NOW BY YOUR SIDE OR AN OPTION WOULD BE TO PLANT THEM ON THE MEATY PART OF THE SHOULDER RESTING LIGHTLY ON TOP
NOW THIS THE FLAT MINOR THAT A FLAT SEVEN OUT BACK IN A PLANT F MAJOR OVER BECAUSE THAT'S AS A D FLAT MAJOR SCALE AND THAT REALLY IS GOING TO CLASS SO THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE WE REALLY GET IN THAT PLAY F MAJOR THROUGH THE HOLES
IF THE AND WE ALSO WANT TO WATCH THE WEATHER SO THAT WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO RAIN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PLANT THE SEEDS A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE IT RAINS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO BE OUT HERE WATERING ALL THE TIME
HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S TIME TO POT A PLANT
BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT I LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHEN TO POT A PLANT
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO POT A PLANT
AND THIS PLANT IS NOT LOOKING TO GREAT
THE POT IS WAY TOO SMALL FOR THIS BIG HUGE PLANT
YOU WANT TO POT YOUR PLANT WHEN YOUR PLANT IS OVERGROWN AND IT'S TOP HEAVY

I HAVE A PLANT IS GUYS IN FULL SUN AND DO NOT GET WATER THEM
THIS IS CALLED THE FOLLOW THE LEADER DRILL TYPICALLY IN FID AND YOU DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW THE LEADER YOU WANT TO ESTABLISH YOUR OWN FOR PLANT BUT IN THIS CASE HERE SO THE DRILL WORKS
IF YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD DRAINAGE YOUR PLANT WILL PROBABLY DIE

I'M GOING TO PLANT TO TWENTY MINUTE RUN
INK IS SUPER STICKY AND WILL CREATE A VACUUM LIKE EFFECT WHEN YOU PLANT
AND BY THE BASIC SOILS AND FERTILIZERS PLANT PROPAGATION PRUNING WHICH I REALLY REFER TO
AND THEN SPRING THE BOTTOM OF YOUR PLANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY OF THE THAT THEY'RE THE OF THE MATERIAL HITS ALL THE PLANT BOTH UP AND DOWN
AND PLANTS LIKE THIS GERANIUM YOU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE ROOT CUTTINGS YOU CAN TAKE STEM CUTTINGS AND IT'LL MAKE ITS OWN PLANT
