MY NAME IS DAVE ANDREWS AND I'VE JUST SHOWED YOU HOW TO USE POWER POINT TEMPLATES
THE BASIC RULES OF SPADES ARE GOING TO BE THE SAME AS ANY OTHER ANY OTHER SPADES GAME EXCEPT YOU'RE PLAYING WITH A TIME LIMIT ROUNDS AND YOU'RE PLAYING TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY POINTS PER ROUND WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN USUAL SO MAKE SURE YOU ADJUST YOUR GAME ACCORDINGLY AND KNOW THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE A HIGH POINT TOTAL VERY QUICKLY
IF IN THIRTY MINUTES THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY POINT TOTAL HAS NOT BEEN REACHED THE TEAM WITH THE HIGH SCORE IS GOING TO WIND THAT ROUTE
SO THIS IS ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX AND SO ON ALL THE WAY UP HERE TO POINT TWENTY FOUR
AS YOU GO AROUND AND POINT THIRTEEN YOU'RE GOING TO SET UP FIVE
IN HERE FOR THINGS GET A LITTLE BIT TRICKY OR MAKE SURE WE PAY ATTENTION TO DETAIL AT THIS POINT
IF YOUR CHILDREN OR OLD ENOUGH THAT THEY CAN WANDER OFF BY THEMSELVES AND ANY GIVEN POINT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE A PLAN TO ME BACK PLAN IF THEY GET LOST AND SOME GUIDELINES AND RULES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FOLLOW WHEN THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN
IF YOU'RE IN EXPERIENCES THIS IT'S HARD TO GET SMOOTH IT FIRST BUT IF YOU KEEP WORKING WITH AN F HEALTH PRETTY SIMPLE YOU'LL GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU THIS UP IT WILL COME OUT REAL SMOOTH
OR TO THE POINT WHERE WE WANT TO CUT FOR THE PATCH
IF YOU DON'T SEE ALL THE FILL ALREADY ON YOUR LIST HERE SELECT THE TWO LITTLE ARROWS POINT TO THE RIGHT FIND AUTO FEEL AS YOU CAN SEE MY DAVE PROFILE SHOWING UP RIGHT THERE
NOW AS THIS POINT OUR LEFT HAND OPENS AND COMES OVER HEAD PALM BLOCK AND NOW SHE'S GOING TO TURN HER TORSO THIS WAY USING THE HAND
AT THIS POINT THE RIGHT HAND IS GOING TO FIRE OUT LIKE THE BEGINNING OF THE TIME WOULD PUNCHING FORWARD IN OUT
YOU CAN EVEN GO BACK AS FAR AS AN TEA FOR POINT OH AS YOUR FULL AS YOUR COMPATIBILITY VERSION ALLOWING YOU TO GET SOME REALLY OLD CRANKY APPLICATIONS TO RUN UNDER VISTA
HOWEVER I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT TODAY THAT YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO BE SO CONCERN ESPECIALLY IN THE BACKYARD GARDEN
WE ARE THEN GOING TO DO THE FINISHING PRESSING ON IT AND AT THAT POINT I WILL TAKE THE TERM GARMENTS THEIR HANGING HERE
SO THE WAY YOU CAN DO AT THIS POINT IS KIND OF FOLD THAN ANY PARTS ARE HANGING OUT OF THE END THAT YOU MAY WANT TO BRING BACK INTO YOUR BUBBLE WRAP ROLL
LIGHTS LET'S OPEN UP MICROSOFT OUR POINT IT BY CLICKING ON THE START BUTTON GOING ALL PROGRAMS MICROSOFT OFFICE IS JUST LAUNCH POWERFUL
THE POINT IS TO KEEP THEM STRAIGHT AHEAD AND WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE
IF YOU HAVE HEAVIER DEVICES YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A SCREW IN ANCHOR SUCH AS THIS OR JUST A STANDARD ANCHOR WHERE YOUR DRILL A HOLE AND THEN YOU WOULD USE A SCREW AS YOUR ATTACH POINT
AND THERE'S SEVERAL HANGERS THAT WE CAN USE THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT THIS POINT
IF IT DOES YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO TAKE AND POINT THAT HOLE IS DIRECTLY INTO THE CENTER OF YOUR DRAIN BUCKET
AT THAT POINT WE WANT TO COME BACK AND JUST CLEAR EACH OF THE RISERS
COME DOWN TO A POINT DOWN TO THE WINDOW OR ANY THEIR PATTERN YOU LIKE TO CHOOSE YOURSELF
WHOEVER HAS THE MOST OF SCARE AUGHT SIDE OF THE WHOLE GROUPS GOING A BOAT ON AND THEY'RE GOING TO GET SOME EXTRA BONUS POINT
YOU CAN DO SUNGLASSES HAND SANITIZER ALSO IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE BLACK BOOK IT'S A GREAT WAY TO LAUGH AND SEE WHAT LADY CARRIES A LITTLE BLACK BOOK AND THAT'S A TWENTY POINT ITEM FROM OR FIFTEEN POINT ITEMS GIVES ME
YOU CAN DO ALL KINDS OF OBSCURE ITEMS AND IT SAYS EVERYTHING THE POINT VALUE AND SEE WHAT KIND OF WEIRD THINGS PEOPLE REALLY HAVING THEIR PURSE
YOU CAN MAKE A POINT TO PLAY OR AS A DAY OR A FEW DAYS
TO DO THE TO CUT THE B YOU WANT TO ENTER IN WITH THE LONG POINT OF THE SKEW REST THE TOOL DOWN AND THEY GET KEEP IT UP HIGH EFFECT ROLLING IT RUB AGAINST THE WOOD IS IDEAL
ALRIGHT SO I THINK ARE FRENCH BREAD PIZZA IS DONE AT THIS POINT BECAUSE IT SMELLS DELICIOUS LOOK AT HOW NICE THAT LOOKS THAT'S UP EVERYTHING PIZZA WITH THE MUSHROOM CAUSE YOUR DOUGH BASIL ONION AND PEPPERONI WHICH LOOKS AMAZING
OKAY THE NEXT CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SCORING YOUR YOUR POINT SO YOUR BALLS TO TO MOVE FORWARD SO EVENTUALLY SINK THE EIGHT BALL WIN THE GAME
I THINK WE CAN GO BE ON THIS POINT
AND NOW THAT THAT YOU'LL SEE THAT AT THIS POINT THE GAME THE ENEMIES REALLY START USING THE EQUIPMENT MORE THAN THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST
THE POINT OF THIS IS LIKE I SAID BEFORE IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOUR I THINK THAT IT'S RECESSING THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY EXIST AS CLOSE TO THE SURFACE AS IT REALLY DOES AND IF YOU PUT A LITTLE HIGHLIGHT IN THE CENTER OF THE FACE THAT WILL BRING THE CENTER OUT AND THE EDGES BACK TO YOUR FACE WILL BEST LOOK A LITTLE THINNER THAN IT REALLY IS
AND IT'S ALRIGHT IF IT DOESN'T FULLY CLOSE AT THIS POINT BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO ADJUST THE TENSIONING IN A LITTLE BIT
AND AT THIS POINT I'M JUST GOING TO RUN MY FINGERS THROUGH IT AND MAKE IT AS MESSY AND IS TEXTURED AS A POSSIBLY CAN
SO YOU WANT TO HAVE YOU WANT TO PUT TWO BALL SO WHERE YOU CAN GET IT KIND OF QUICK AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BOTHER YOU DOING THE POINT
TRY NOT TO HAVE THEM ON THE FLOOR IS THERE ON THE FLOOR ON YOUR STYLE YOU POINT AND THEN YOUR WEIGHT YOU MY STEP ON THEM ON HEIGHT YOURSELF
THE SURFACE THAT'S THE POINT AND YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO TENSES TO PUT THE BALL INSIDE THIS SMALL SQUARE OF CAUSE YOU INSIDE THE SERVICE LINE
THEN AT THAT POINT THEY WOULD MAYBE MADE INTO THE CRACKER AND THEY'RE FOR THAT WOULD BE CALLED A LIVE ROLL CRACKER
THEY WERE SOAK FOR THE DESIGNATED TIME SO THAT THEY WOULD COME TO THE POINT OF SPROUT
IF IT'S STERLING SILVER IT'S GOING TO BE STAMPED OF POINT NINE TO FIVE STERLING SILVER
THE POINT IS IS TO HAVE THE PLACE CLEAN IF YOU CAN AFFORD TO DO RENOVATIONS JUST MAKE SURE ITS PROPER
THIS POINT IT'S GOOD TO USE THE I USE ABOUT A NICE ROUGH PAPER EITHER SOMEWHERE AROUND THE SIXTY GRID OR MAYBE A LAUGH WITH ROUGH STAGE
NOW GO AHEAD AND PURCHASE YOUR TICKETS ON LINE AND THEN ONCE YOU MAKE YOUR PURCHASE YOU CAN PICK YOUR TICKETS UP AT THE END TRACK OF DEPARTURE POINT
AGAIN YOU CAN USE EAR SO JUST TAKING THE MUCH DIFFERENT APPEARANCE OF THIS POINT AS HAS THE TURKEY CARCASS IT'S IN IT
MAKE SURE YOU POINT YOU'RE REALLY POINT THAT SO TO DIP AROUND LIKE THIS AND POINT
AT THIS POINT YOUR THIGHS ONE TWO ARE TOUCHING
THEY MAKE THE COMMON THERE IS FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE COUNT ONE POINT
BUT UNTIL YOU GET THEM TO THAT POINT YOU'VE GOT TO DO A LOT OF HELPING AND A LOT OF SHOWING SO THAT THE DOG CAN MAKE THE DECISION ON IS ON AND THAT'S HOW YOU TRAIN A DOG HOW TO USE THE DOG THE DOOR
ONCE HE MAKES IT THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE AT THAT POINT IT'S VERY CRITICAL THAT YOU REALLY MAKING FEEL GOOD ABOUT HIS VICTORY
IT HAS A LITTLE STRETCH POINT BEFORE THE BRAKE POINT
YOU COULD ALSO TAKE THAT SHIMMERY COLOR AT THIS POINT SINCE THE EYES ARE ALMOST DONE AND TAKE IT A LITTLE BIT UNDER THE BROW JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE OF A SPARKLE
SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS GO AND GET OUR THREE POINT STANCE AND THE FIRST PART OF THIS IS WE WANT TO FIRE OUT AND FIT IN THE NUMBERS AND JUST GO THAT FAR SET UP GOOD
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT A LOT OF BEGINNING PLAYERS DO THAT REALLY IS NOT PROPER IS PUTTING THE CUE BALL TOO FAR BACK WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TOO MUCH DISTANCE TO TRAVEL FROM THAT POINT UP TO THERE
I THINK I'VE MADE MY POINT
USUALLY YOU POINT THE LIGHT INTO THE REFLECTIVE SIDE AND IT ACTUALLY WORKS IS A REALLY NICE SOFT BOX
SO THIS ONE POINT IS IS DON'T BE SCARED OFFER DON'T BE DETERRED FOR MAYBE TRYING TO GET INTO THIS BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ELECTRONICS
SO COLOR CORRECTION IS GOING TO BE REAL VITAL POINT FOR PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANT TO MAKE THEIR FILM SOMETHING SPECIAL
SO TAKE MY THREE MILLIMETER WRENCH OR IT'S A TO POINT FIVE MILLIMETER WRENCH IF YOU'RE USING THE OBI BRAND GRIPS
SAME THING ON THIS SIDE FROM THE TOP POINT TO THIS POINT FOLD IT DOWN
FROM THIS POINT TO THE TOP POINT FOLD IT DOWN
NOW THIS IS A MATTER OF FEEL AT THIS POINT BUT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT ABOUT HALF AN INCH OF OF CLAY DEPENDING ON HOW BIG YOU WANT YOUR FOOT AT THE BOTTOM OF OF OF YOUR POT
SAME THING ON THIS SIDE MAKING SURE THE POINTS MEAT POINT
POINT TO THE CENTER CREASE IS PARALLEL TO THE CENTER CREASE
NOW WE ARE GOING TO FOLD THIS POINT INTO THE CENTER BUT PARALLEL THE CREASE WILL BE PARALLEL TO THE CENTER LIKE THIS
AND SUDDENLY LAYERS FOLD THAT POINT THAT WE JUST MADE AND SAME THING ON THIS SIDE INSIDE REVERSE FOLD THAT POINT
AND WHAT I'VE GOT HERE IS A A CAN IN THIRTY FIVE MILLIMETER ONE POINT FOR A APERTURE FIXED FOCAL LENGTH WILL LENS
THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT AND I DON'T SUGGEST THAT YOU PRACTICE IT TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE READY TO JUGGLE SIX BALL BEFORE TRYING THIS TRICK BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO AT LEAST BE ABLE TO FLASH THE BALLS IN ONE HAND TO REALLY DO THIS
WITH CALF RAISES WE WANT TO WORK THE LOWER PART AND BELOW THE KNEE INTO THE ACHILLES THAT POINT ATTACHMENT TO THE HEEL
HOWEVER IF THE OTHER TEAM'S SERVES AND WE HIT IT OUT OR THEY HIT IN OUR SQUARE THEY GET THE POINT
SO IF MY TEAM WHICH IS SERVE THE BALL AND WE GET IT IN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CHORD WE GET IN THE SQUARE IN THE ON THE GROUND WE GET A POINT
AND WHAT WHEN USING THIS TYPE OF SCORING AND THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A POINT IS WHEN YOU SERVE THE BALL
THE ONLY WAY IN TRADITIONAL INSIDE OUT SCORING YOU CAN GET A POINT IS IF YOU SERVE THE BALL
BUT IF IT WHEN IT COMES TO THE POINT THAT YOU ACTUALLY NEED A RESTRAINING ORDER MANY MANY TIMES INDIVIDUALS IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT CAN ASSIST YOU ARE DIRECT YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO GO TO FILE FOR RESTRAINING OR
AT THIS POINT I'M JUST GOING TO DO THE SAME THING THAT I WAS DOING ON THE UPPER LIP ON THE LOWER IT LOWER LIP AREA AND ON THE CHIN TRYING REFINED A LITTLE BIT BETTER
INSTEAD WHICH YOU HAVE IS THE IDEA OF THE WAY YOU WANT TO PRESENT THE WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU ARE DOCUMENTING WHETHER IT BE AN INDIVIDUAL OR AN EVENT THAT HAPPEN AT ONE POINT POINT OR ANOTHER OR AN ISSUE
SO THIS POINT I WANT YOU NICE WIRE TOOL IN THE END OF THAT AND MOVE IT OVER THE LEFT
THE SECOND THING TO DO IS SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION FROM HUMAN PHYSICIAN BECAUSE LIKE I SAID THESE BITES CAN BECOME A VERY VERY INFECTED AND AND LITERALLY TURN VERY BAD AND TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY REQUIRE SURGERY
ALL YOU HAVE ONE ON THE TOP THAT ALLOWS YOU TO KIND OF BRING YOUR TOES TOGETHER AND POINT THEM UP OKAY DORSI PLANT THEM
AND AT THIS POINT WE WOULD AGAIN USE OUR SLIP STITCH
SO WE PUNCH SO WE CAN HAVE THE DRILL START IN A PLACE AND SET IT JUST YOU KNOW TRYING TO DRILL WITH NO WITH NO OF FOCAL POINT OR A FIRST POINT
NOW UP TO THIS POINT WE LOOK AT HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN CLAY BODY BASED ON HIGHLY PROCESSED INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS BUT BECAUSE CLAY IS A NATURALLY OCCURRING SUBSTANCE EXIST RIGHT IN AND THE GROUND WE CAN TO GET OUT OF THE GROUND AND USE THAT AS THIS
AND YOUR PARTNER ONCE YOU WANT YOUR PARTNER TO FLEX THE FOOT AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUT YOUR HAND ON THE MEATY PART OF THE CALF MUSCLE AS THEY FLEX UP AND USE RIGHT THERE THAT POINT OF ATTACHMENT THE HAMSTRING AND RELEASE
NOW THE E STRING THERE'S NO THE STRING TO REST DOWN SO YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO GET YOURSELF WHEN YOU GET TO THAT POINT
WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING A DAY YOU CAN EITHER DO A POINT TO POINT ROOT VARIATIONS THESE TWO VEHICLES WANT THE START AND ONE AT THE BOTTOM
AND THAT'S A PRETTY BIG POINTS OF POINT BACKPACKING YOUR WHICH TO TAKE A CUP ONES
IF YOUR CAT IS COMFORTABLE WITH THAT LITTLE HOLE WHICH IS A BIG STOPPING POINT FOR A LOT OF CATS THAT YOU CAN START MAKING THE WHOLE BIGGER LITTLE BIGGER LITTLE BIGGER LITTLE BIGGER AND BASICALLY THE IDEA IS AND YOU CAN YOU CAN USE A LITTLE ON THE THAT SOMETHING AT THE HARDWARE STORE THAT YOU CAN USE TO TO LINE THE INSIDE OF THE HOLES WILL LEARN DOESN'T FALL RIGHT THROUGH ON BUT AS I GET BIGGER AND BIGGER THE GOAL IS TO GET BIG ENOUGH THAT THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF LITTER ON THE OUTSIDE AND THEN THERE'S NO LITTER AT ALL
YOU GET AT THIS POINT I START BRINGING IT DOWN ITSELF
ONCE YOU GET TO THAT POINT STOP HOLD FOR THIRTY SECONDS EASE OFF OF IT AND GO BACK AGAIN AND STRETCH UNTIL YOU KNOW YOU GET TO THAT POINT WE CAN WITHSTAND THE PAINT IS YOUR HANDS YOU'RE STRETCHING IT
THERE'S THE CALL BODY GLIDE AND ANY OTHER KIND OF SLIPPERY OILY SUBSTANCE THAT YOU CAN PUT ON A CHAFE POINT SO TYPICALLY PUTTING A LITTLE BIT OF VASELINE OR PETROLEUM JELLY UNDERNEATH YOUR ARM PITS ON YOUR INNER THIGHS PERHAPS ON YOUR TOES OR AROUND YOUR NECK ARE GOOD POINTS TO PREVENT CHAFING
ANY KIND OF CHIEF POINT WHERE I THE CLOTHING DOESN'T FIT EXACTLY RIGHT SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING
RALLY SCORING IS WHERE EVERY SERVE IS A POINT
THIS IS JUST A SIMPLE TECHNIQUE THAT'S OFTEN REFERRED TO AS A STALL AND IT'S ESSENTIALLY DOES STOPPING YOUR POI IN MID AIR WHEN THEY REACH THE FARTHEST POINT AWAY FROM YOU AND REVERSING THE DIRECTION
AN ADVANCED VERSION OF THIS MOVE IS TO JUST ALL ONE POI KEEPING THE OTHER ONE GOING THAT WAY THAT IT WAS AND THEN YOU HAVE YOUR POINT MOVING INTO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
CASE IN POINT ON MY PICTURE I ONLY HAD A CRAB SITTING OVER HERE ON THE LOWER PART
AT THIS POINT I LIKE TO TAKE MY POTTER'S KNIFE AND MAKE IT REALLY DRY DOWN THERE THE SCRAPE OFF ALL THE FIFTH OF ALL THE EXTRA CLAY
YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT IN TIME ALL OF US ARE GOING TO INCUR SOME TYPE OF MEDICAL PROBLEM OR MINOR INJURY
NOW AT THIS POINT MY HEAD IS MY MOST IMPORTANT PEN APPENDAGE HERE
NOW THIS POINT WILL COME IN HANDY WHEN YOU GET INTO THOSE TIGHT QUARTERS
THE PRINCESS SEAMS AS WE'VE DISCUSSED MANY TIMES THEY SERVER FUNCTION OF BRINGING IN THE GARMENT AT ITS MOST BARREL POINT WHICH IS YOUR WAIST AND THEN THEY FLARED OUT BASED ON THE HIPS AND THEY COME BACK IN BASED ON THE LINE
WORK CONSUMPTION WHEN YOU GO CHECK OUT THE SHOWER HEAD AND YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING THIS TO POINT FIVE G E A D G PM STAYS IN GALLONS PER MINUTE
CLIP YOURSELF INTO A TREE OR ALL THE OR SOMETHING AND SOLID SO THAT YOU CAN USE IT AS A BLADE POINT OFF THE SHORE AND THAT WAY NO MATTER HOW MUCH TENSIONS ON THAT ROPE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO LEAN AGAINST THE BALL THOUGH THE TREE USING THAT FLIP LINE AND IS NOT GOING TO GO ANYWHERE
IF THAT POINT SCRUBBER SHOULDERS TO WHERE YOU'RE THROWING TAKEN I STEP
WE HAVE TO POINT OUT ALMOST EVERY LITTLE DETAIL THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED BUT WE DON'T DO IT ALL THAT ONCE IT'S A LITTLE BIT HERE AND THERE WE JUST SPRINKLE EVERY BOOK WITH JUST A LITTLE BIT AND HELPS
BASICALLY IF YOU CLICK AND DRAG IT TO DRAG OUT TO THE SUNLIGHT DEPENDING ON HOW FALL FROM THE ORIGINAL POINT THESE HANDLES ALL WILL DEPEND ON HOW WIDE EAT YOUR OFF IT'S GOING TO BE
SO IF YOU JUST REMEMBER THAT SIMPLE POINT
I WANT YOU TO OBSERVE IT AGAIN TO OVERLAP POINT RIGHT TOE AND COME BACK INTO THE BASIC
YOU DEFINITELY CANNOT LIFT THE BALL UP AT ANY POINT IN TIME
SO WHEN YOU DECIDE TO BREAK UP WITH SOME WHEN YOU DO IT IS STYLE YOU DO IT QUICKLY BUT YOUR EMOTIONALLY NEED TO BE COLD AND TO THE POINT
AND I KIND OF JUST USE THE WINDOW OVER HERE TO IT AS A REFERENCE POINT CAUSE THE WINDOWS COMING IN FROM HERE SO I LIKE MY HOW I LIKE TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROOM
SO THIS POINT YOU'RE YOU STUDY THAT YOU'RE PLAYING I'M SURE IS GREAT
I HAVE A SENSE OF HOW FAST IT WOULD BE FROM HALF WAY AND THEN I TRY TO POT IT TO THAT HALFWAY POINT WITH THE RIGHT SPEED
TEN TO FIFTEEN AND THAT'S A POINT SKILL I USUALLY LIKE TO USE EASY ITEMS FIVE POINTS CUT A MIDDLE OF THE ROAD ITEMS TEMPLATES AND THINGS THAT YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT THEM HAVE FIFTEEN POINTS
NOW WHAT YOU'LL WANT TO DO IF YOU'RE HOSTING THE BACHELORETTE PARTY IS MAKE A LIST OF ITEMS THAT YOU COMMONLY FIND IN A PURSE AND MAYBE NOT SO COMMONLY FINE OCCURS AND ASSESSMENT EACH A POINT VALUE
YOU CAN FIND THAT PARTICULAR POINT THAT'S A REALLY REALLY GOOD ONE
BASICALLY THE CHILD JUST POINTS WITH THEIR PENCIL AND COUNTS AS THEY POINT AND THEN THEY WRITE THE NUMBER AND IN PENCIL
YOU'RE AIMING TO GET THE STOCKPILES MEN IN THE MIDDLE TO A A POINT WHERE YOU COULD USE YOUR STOCK PILE
BUT WET SCIENTISTS ARE AND RESEARCH ARE PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT THIS POINT IS THAT KINK STRESS JUST KIND OF HAS AN OVERALL LEG EFFECT ON YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS
AND IN THE LAST STEP I SHOWED YOU HOW TO GRIND YOUR ART GLASS TO FIT TO THE SIZE YOUR PATTERN A PILLOW PAPER PATTERN OFF AT THIS POINT
BUT THE WHOLE POINT OF IT IS THAT IT REALLY FORCES THE FACT THAT THE BODY'S GOING IN THERE
AT THAT POINT YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO WANT TO GO SEE YOUR PIERCER AND HAVE IT ADJUSTED SO IT FITS A LOT MORE TIGHTLY
SO IF IT GETS TO THE POINT WHERE YOU REALLY WANT TO STORE YOUR CAT OUTSIDE BECAUSE THE CORRECT IN YOUR HOUSE BUT RATHER HAVE A LOT AND KEEP THEM FROM RIGHT TO YOUR HOUSE AND SIDEWAYS
IT AT A YOU KNOW YOU CAN CHECK THE TIME TABLE OUT THAT'S THE POINT
SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU SEE COUNSELING MARRIAGE COUNSELING AT THIS POINT BECAUSE IT IS TO STOP THE THE THE PAIN AT THAT POINT A PROFESSIONAL PERSON CAN HELP UNDERSTAND HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE CHEATING
THIS PARTICULAR ONE YOU NEED TO POINT IN FULL SUN AND IT TAKES ABOUT EIGHTY DAYS TO MATURE
NOW WHAT I LIKE TO GET THIS POINT IS TO ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE
IT MAY ACTUALLY TAKE YOU A WHILE TO GET THE CAT FOR IT FROM THE POINT THAT THEY'RE DOWN ON THE FLOOR USING LITTER BOX TO WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY UP ON TOP OF THE TOILET USING THE LITTER BOX
EVERYONE HAS TO BE A PENS HITTER AT SOME POINT OR ANOTHER
IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU'RE SHOOTING SOMEBODY NEVER POINT TO LIGHT DIRECTLY OUT THERE
THAT'S WHERE ANOTHER TYPE OF MASK KIND OF LIKE A LAUGHING GASES PUT ON THE PATIENT AND THEY ARE BASICALLY PUT COMPLETELY ON OR TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WILL NOT FILL IN A THEN THEY CAN HEAR ANYTHING
ONCE AGAIN IF YOU DO NOT HAVE MANNA BY THIS POINT YOU CAN MILE AGAIN AS MANY TIMES TO YOU GET THAT
START WITH SOME GENTLE WELL FOR OUR AS YOU CAN WORK INTO SOME DEEPER PETRA SOFT AT THIS POINT
AND THAT ENTAILS JUST HAVING A SMALL BOBBER ON YOUR LINE THAT YOU PUT IT THE POINT WHERE YOU WANT TO FISH AT
ONE YOU CAN TIE A VERY SIMPLE SLIP KNOT AND JUST REALLY REALLY YOUR LINE UP TO THAT POINT
YOU WANT NICE AN ARCHED AND THEN WHEN YOU GET TO THAT POINT YOU GO DOWN
AND WHERE THE EYEBROW FINISHES AT THE HIGH POINT WHICH IS RIGHT HERE YOU WANT PROBABLY THE SMALLEST AMOUNT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PUT ON
WE HAVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE HERE OF ANOTHER PIN WHEEL AND THE ALTERNATING HAT TRIANGLES HAD BEEN KEYS HERE HERE IN HERE TO GIVE IT KIND OF A FOCAL POINT IN THE MIDDLE
YOU CAN EITHER USE A PAPER CUTTER OR I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS SQUARE BY FOLDING IT DIAGONALLY RIGHT TO THE POINT OVER ON THIS SIDE AND MATCH THE EDGES EXACTLY TO HERE AND THEN JUST FOLD THAT RIGHT IN HALF
SO IF YOU NEED TO ANY POINT GO AHEAD AND REALLY JUST YOURSELF MAYBE PLACE THE BLOCK A LITTLE CLOSER MAKE SURE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE
SANITIZER AT THIS POINT THE BREWING PROCESS YOU NEED TO CLEAN ALL OF YOUR EQUIPMENT BUT IN PARTICULAR YOU NEED TO SANITIZE WHICH IS THE ACTUAL OF CLEANING YOUR PRIMARY FERMENTER IF YOU ACTUALLY GO WITH THE GLASS CARBOY NEEDED TO SANITIZE YOUR FILTER AS WELL AS LONG AS YOUR AS WELL AS YOUR AIR LOCK YOUR RUBBER STOPPERS AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT WILL BE TOUCHING THE BEER AFTER IT HAS GONE CALLED
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING AT THAT POINT BUT RIGHT NOW THE POT IS FINISH FOR NOW AND SO WE COME BACK AND BURNISHER
ON THE NEXT POINT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FOLLOW IS TO CREATE A CONTRAST THING VOICE FOR YOUR CHARACTER
OKAY SO WE'RE JUST ABOUT A THING TO THE POINT WHERE STEVE FEELS THAT HE'S WARM HIMSELF UP ADEQUATELY
PICK IT UP WALKING AROUND WITH YOU THIS WAY AND I WANT IT TO SET UP A LOT OF FUN FIVE TO TEN TO THIRTY TO FEEL THAT IT IS ONLY TWENTY FOUR FOOT LOUDER BUT I FIND THE LEVERAGE POINT
NOW THAT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE IF I'M ROLLING MY BRUSH ON IN THE PAINT TO TRY TO GET A NICE POINT ON BECAUSE MY SURFER GUY IS GOING TO HAVE SPIKY HERE
THIS IS A POINT WHERE YOU NEED TO ALSO BE SURE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY WATER FALLING OUT OF THE SHAFT YOUR BRUSH
ALRIGHT SO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT GOING TO COMPLETELY FOLLOW AROUND AS IF IT WERE GOING COMPLETELY ALONG WITH THE CIRCULAR DIAGRAM SO I THINK YOU CAN SEE MY POINT BEST IN THIS LITTLE THIS LITTLE DIAGRAM
AT THIS POINT YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND STITCH THE REST OF THE WAY DOWN ON TO IT
AND POINT TWENTY FOUR YOU'RE GOING TO SET UP TO IN THE TWENTY IN TWENTY AND POINT TWENTY FOUR
OVER HERE AND POINT EIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO SET UP THREE PIECES IN POINTS SIX YOU'RE GOING TO SET UP FIVE
GREEN IS ALSO THE MID POINT IN THE SHOCK WRIST BETWEEN THE LOWER CHOKERS IN THE UPPER SHOCK GRAMS
THE MOSQUITO GUARD WILL KILL THE CRESTED CRACK WORN BY DEALING ONE POINT OF FUR STRIKE DAMAGE
YOU WANT TO KEEP THE TOE KIND OF POINT AND WE DON'T WANT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO IT AT ALL
THESE GO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO FIVE POINT ZERO FIVE POINT FIVE AND SIX
USUALLY THERE'S A LITTLE POINT HERE THIS BEEN MADE ON YOUR TROUSERS
I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT THIS POINT THAT ON THE CANCER SURVIVOR ON THE TWELVE FOR YOUR CANCER SURVIVE FOR AND WHEN I TELL PEOPLE THAT THEY LOOK AT ME AND DISBELIEF
YOU'LL BE ON THE MICROPHONE SINGING A SCRATCH VOCAL WHICH JUST GIVES THEM A POINT OF REFERENCE FOR FOR THE MELODY FALLS RHYTHMICALLY AND ALSO WHAT PART OF THE SONG THAT THEY'RE IN
TAKE YOUR THUMB YOUR THUMBS THE PIVOT POINT
TAKE IT AND POINT IT STRAIGHT DOWN LIKE SO
SO WE'RE GOING OFF OR TEN WE'VE BEEN DOING THE SAME THINGS UP TO THIS POINT
YOU WANT TO KEEP THEM WET BUT NOT TO THE POINT TO BE IN SATURATED AND KEEP THEM WHERE IT THEY'LL I GET A LITTLE WARMTH BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE TOO PARTICULAR ABOUT THE TEMPERATURE IS FOR GERMINATION CAUSE THEY'LL BE GERMANY IN A COLD SOIL ANYWAY
NOW AT THIS POINT IF YOU WANT TO PUSH THE FLOWER UP SO YOU DON'T HAVE SO MUCH SKEWER YOU CAN GRASP THE SKEWER TIGHTLY AND JUST PUSH IT UP
YOU DON'T WANT TO TRY TO GAS ON EACH FENDER WHERE ABOUT HIGH POINT IS OR WHERE PARTICULAR BODY LINE IS YOU JUST WANT TO MEASURE OUT A STRAIGHT LINE THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE WHEEL AND HE'S GOING TO RECORD THAT ON A PIECE OF PAPER FOR EACH CORNER AND SEE HOW THEY COMPARE
YOU CAN EASILY ACCOMPLISH THIS LIKE I SAID BY CON INTO A HIGHER POINT AND LOOKING OVER THE LANDSCAPE
THAT WASN'T THE SMOOTHEST EVER BUT YOU GET THAT YOU GET THE POINT
NOW WITH THE OPEN PART POINT IT TOWARDS YOU THIS WILL BECOME THE TOP TRIANGLE BECOME THE BASE OF THE FLOWER
MAKES ACTUALLY PAINFUL INSIDE LOTS OF YOUR TRUMPET SIZING FIGHT A POINT DEFENSE WE CAN USE FOR WOMEN'S SELF DEFENSE DEALS WITH THE UNDERARM STILL WITH THE UNDER ARMS
SEE IF YOU CAN HOLD THIS FOR SAY FIVE TO TEN BREATHS JUST THAT GENTLE GENTER GENTLE PRESSURE MAKING AWARE OF YOUR CENTER POINT MAKING YOU AWARE OF THIS POWER IN YOUR ARMS AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE EXHALE TO RELEASE JUST LET YOUR HANDS FALL TO YOUR KNEE
WHEN DOING NOW IS MEASURING THE LAST POINT OF CUTTING
OKAY THE POINT THAT I JUST CUT IS HERE AND THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO FOLLOW
BUT THIS IS A POINT WHERE WE FEEL THAT WORK COMFORTABLE WITH THIS PERSON
LOOKS LIKE I SET MY SEAT RIGHT JUST BY GUESSING THERE BECAUSE I LIKE TO RUN A SEVENTY THREE AND A QUARTER OR OR SEVEN THREE POINT TO FIVE MILLIMETER SEAT HEIGHT AND THAT'S A THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT
NOW TO WORK ON THIS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET THIS CATCH DOWN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE USED TO KICKING YOUR LEG UP AND CATCHING THE UNDERSIDE OF THE CRYSTAL STICK ON OR SO AT THE TOP SIDE THE CRYSTAL STICK ON THE UNDERSIDE OF YOUR LEG AT THE RIGHT BALANCE POINT THAT JUST SPINS OVER NICE AND EASY LIKE THAT
AND LET THE OF THIS RIGHT OVER THOSE THAT DIRTY POINTS BECAUSE NEGATIVE POINT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET HIM
BUT WE HAVE TO GET TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN BOWL LOCK THEM OUT AND FOCUS
I BEGIN BUILDING FROM THE CENTER POINT OF MY AREA AND I'D DESIGN MY CONE SHAPE IT'S GOING TO BE THE ESSENTIAL PART OF THE SAND CASTLE
YOU PUT THAT PRESSURE THERE IS TO STEADY PRESSURE OR YOU CAN DO A ROCKING MOTION JUST BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH AND THAT'S ONE THAT SHE OBJECTS TO THIS WILL HAPPEN SOMETIMES WITH YOUR ANIMAL THAT THEY'LL OBJECT TO A POINT
THAT'S TELLING YOU THAT IT'S A LITTLE TOO UNCOMFORTABLE SO WHAT YOU THEN WANT TO DO IS MOVE TO ANOTHER POINT AND GO ON FROM THERE
IT'S JUST BELOW THE POINT WE JUST DID AND IT'S GOING TO BE AGAIN IN A MUSCLE BELLY JUST BELOW THE KNEE RIGHT IN FRONT THE BONE
FIND THE POINTY IS POINT TO THE SHOULDER
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR FIRE TO GET DOWN TO SOLO THAT YOU PERHAPS HAVE TO REALLY RELY CURE YOUR FIRE AND A SO AFTER THIS WOULD BURNS DOWN TO A CERTAIN POINT ON MY ADD TO MAYBE THREE PIECES OF WOOD WHATEVER
AND START OUT WITH THE BOTTOM PART OF IT SINCE THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF IT BEING A PLATFORM IS THAT IT HAS A PLATFORM
I'M GOING TO DO IS I FOUND THIS KNEE POINT WHEN I WAS TOUCHING EARLIER WHERE THE RESIST DIVINEY OF MY FINGER WAS CREATING OF A LITTLE BIT OF A PITCH BEND IN THE CIRCUIT
AND SO NOW I WANT TO DO THE NOW THAT I'VE HOOK THESE WIRES UP I'M GOING TO TRY ALLIGATOR CLIPPING THESE WIRES FROM THOSE POINTS FROM THE BEND POINT RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT HERE
SO YOU JUST CLIP IT TO ONE POINT ON THE SIDE AND ONE ON THE MIDDLE AND ONCE FIRE IT UP
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT SLOW FOR YOU THEN WE'LL GO A LITTLE BIT QUICKER SO YOU CAN SEE WILL POINT OUT SOME OF THE FINER DETAILS STARTING
BUT THIS POINT IS WHEN WE ARE GOING TO ADD OUR SPECIALLY INGREDIENTS FOR THIS ONE WE'RE GOING TO ADD THAT CRAB MEAT THAT WITH THAT IN AND OUT AND YOU CAN BUY LUMP CRAB OR YOU CAN JUST GET A COUPLE OF CANS OF CRAB MEAT METAL WORK BECAUSE WE JUST WANT THIS TO SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE DAY TO FACE
IT'S PRETTY MUCH JUST KICKING MOTION AGAINST AROUND TO DRAWING IT FROM THAT POINT ON
IF THAT DOESN'T THEN THEY'RE DEFINITELY IS PROBABLY SOMETHING WRONG WITH SOME CORE MISSING OR SUCH AN YOU PROBABLY WOULD WANT TO TAKE IT AND AT THAT POINT
FAILURES THE POINT WHEN YOU CAN NO LONGER DO A PERFECT REPETITION
ANYWHERE THAT IS ON THE ACTUAL CLOTHING ITEM THAT YOU CAN PREDICT WOULD BE A CHAFE POINT
BASICALLY WE'RE JUST USING THEM SLICED BASIC SLICE NOW OUR ONIONS THE BOTTOM PORTION OF OUR GREEN ONIONS WILL GO INTO THE RECIPE IN AN EARLIER POINT THEN TOPS WHICH WE'RE ALSO GOING TO USE
BUT MY POINT IS AS PEOPLE TEND TO FOCUS ON THE LINE AND FORGET ABOUT THE SPEED NOT REALIZING THAT THE ODDS OF BEEN MAKING THIS POT AREN'T VERY GOOD
NOW OF COURSE OF THE PART OF THE SLOPE YOU'RE PUTTING ON THIS PRETTY SEVERE YOU BETTER AIM IT OUT TO THE HIGH POINT
YOU CAN TEACH THEM THESE TACTICS GO OVER ROLE PLAYING EXERCISES AGAIN WHEN YOU FIND IT ARE SAYING SOMETHING PERHAPS AN APPROPRIATE ON THE PHONE OR NOT VERY PROFESSIONAL JUST POINT OUT
SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SPIN MY HOOK AROUND SO THAT MY THREADS HANGING DOWN NOT MAKING CONTACT WITH THAT SHARP POINT AND I'M READY TO MOVE ONTO THE NEXT STEP
I SAY IT'S MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHOEVER HAS THE BRAKE ACTUALLY HAS CONTROL OF THE TABLE AT THAT POINT IN TIME
HOWEVER IF YOU DON'T BREAK PROPERLY AND SAY YOU SCRATCH ON THE BRAKE OR YOU DON'T POCKET A BALL ALL YOU'RE DOING AT THAT POINT IS JUST TURNING CONTROL OVER THE TABLE TO YOUR OPPONENT
I HAVE HERE AND JUST AS A SIMPLE PRINCESS SEAMS IT WITH THE BELL AND I PUT THE BELT AT THE HIP POINT
FIRST POINT WILL USE TALK ABOUT IN THE WEB BETWEEN THE THUMB AND THE FIRST FINGER IS LARGE INTESTINE FOUR
AND IF THEY'RE POINT AREAS THAT PARTICULAR FILL TENDER THAT'S USUALLY A GOOD SIGN YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT LOCATION
THIS IS A GREAT POINT FOR TREATING OVERALL FOR THE WHOLE HEAD SO NO MATTER WHERE THE PAIN IS ORIGINATING JUST GIVING IT SOME LIGHT OR DEEP MASSAGE CAN BE VERY HELPFUL
SO I TEND TO GO OVER IT AND OVER IT UNTIL I FEEL THAT THE LINES ARE SUFFICIENTLY DARK ENOUGH AND ONCE I'VE GOTTEN TO THAT POINT AND I TAKE MY WORKABLE FIXATIVE SPRAY ON MY SPRAYED INSIDE OF THE AREA IN ORDER TO JUST KEEP THE GRAPHITE DOWN TO START MY COLLAGE
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND A POINT WHERE YOU STOP AND THAT'S ACTIVE RANGE OF MOTION BOOM RIGHT THERE
SO WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR GARDEN YOUR MAN YOU GO ON HELP SIDE AGAIN YOU NEED TO STAY LOW DROP STEP AND KEEP THOSE GOOD WIDE STANCE IS UP OR SPRINT TO A PARTICULAR POINT TO TRY TO GET OVER AND STOP THIS GUY
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP YOU FROM LIFTING THIS HAND UP PLACE YOUR IN MOTION SO IT'S PROBABLY MORE POINT
BOY DEFINITELY PREFER A PH A LITTLE BIT HIGHER A LITTLE BIT OUT GOING APPROXIMATELY SEVEN POINT TO SEVEN POINTS FOR
INSIDE WILL BE A FILE CALLED S IV SPLINTER CELL VERSION TO POINT NO NTSC AGE BOX EIGHT SKEW AND AS I D DOT SPLINTER CELL VERSION TO PLAY NO X BOX EIGHTS
I CAN TURN TO A FIVE ONE POINT A FIVE POINT ONCE AROUND SOUND AS WELL AS A LEFT CENTER RIGHT AND NOT SELBE TYPE MIXING SAME FOR FOR SPEAKERS
FOUR HOURS POINT A TO NEVER GOT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE
I WAS AN THAT A LOT OF ACTING IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE AND EVEN AFTER COLLEGE IT SO I GUESS IT SOME POINT I WANTED TO BE AN ACTRESS
YOUR MARKET AND IF YOU HAVE TO WALK AWAY AND COME BACK IT ALLOWS YOU TO DO THAT BY CLICKING THE FINE BUTTON RECALLING THAT WAY POINT
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO MARK A WEIGHT POINT INTO THE UNIT
THE NEXT SHOT GRAB IS THE THIRD EYE POINT AND YOU NEED TO GO
ANOTHER USE IS A V LOW AND THIS IS A MORE CONTROLLABLE WAY OF PUTTING ITSELF ON THE END OF TWO LINES WAY YOU'LL THEN TO THE POINT HERE AND YOU CAN BE MOVE BACK AND FORTH AND UP AND DOWN THE RIVER ON THE END OF THAT THE ALL OF THESE WILL BE SHOWING YOU LATER
THEN YOU THAT WILL MIGHT HAVE A FEW PROBLEMS GETTING THE CROTCH WE'RE READY TO POINT
THE COMPONENT WILL NOT TURN INDEPENDENTLY BEING THAT THIS IS THE UPPER MOUNTING POINT FOR THE SUSPENSION
NOW TO TOUCH MOTOR INSTEAD OF HAVING TO START ALL OVER WITH THE RIGHT AND START AT THE BEGINNING AND REDO EVERY AUTOMATION POINT YOU CAN TAKE TOUCH AND START WHEREVER YOU LIKE
BUT ANYWAY THROW THE BALL TO THE GLOVE POINT OF THE PROPER GRIP
AT THIS POINT WHEN YOU'VE GOT MOST OF YOUR CHEST OVER THE TREE YOU DON'T WANT TO KICK OVER IT AND TRYING TO GET PASTA
WHICH POINT WHEN YOU GET CLOSE TO IT REACH UP GRAB THE STRING ON A WHOLE YOURSELF OVER SO THE STRING IS ON THE WHEEL WAIST
BY THAT POINT YOU'RE UP THERE YOU'RE STAGING YOUR IN YOUR LAYING YOU KNOW YOUR STRATEGY NOW YOU JUST GOT TO GO DELIVER WHAT YOU AND YOUR CREW TEETH HAVE ALREADY DECIDED
ORGANIZING FROM EDITORIAL STAND POINT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR SEPARATE BENDS OR FOLDERS ALL I HAVE A SPECIFIC PURPOSES
AT THAT POINT YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IT DOWN IT'S A LOW GEAR AND YOU'RE GOING TO START TO WALK YOUR WAY UP TO THE STAGING LIGHTS
WE'RE ALSO DO AT THIS POINT BECAUSE WE'VE GOT SALT MARKS ANOTHER MARK FROM A PARTING TOOL ALL SQUARE UP THIS THE TOP END OF THE BODY
I'VE I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF THESE THINGS WHICH I'LL GO OVER WITH YOU WHEN WE GET TO THAT POINT
BUT I WANT TO KEEP IT KEEP THE MOTIONS NICE SHORTEN SWEET TO THE POINT
IF YOU GET TO THAT POINT YOU'RE IN GOOD SHAPE
AS FAR AS SCROLLING OPTIONS THAT REALLY HELPS FIND SONGS AND AND HELPS WITH JUST A QUICKNESS OF WHERE YOUR CURSOR MIGHT BE AS FAR AS LIKE IF YOU STOP YOUR SONG YOU WANT YOUR CURSOR TO STOP RIGHT WHERE YOU STOP IT AND YOU WANT TO STOP AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE TRACK AND YOU WANT TO STOP AT A CERTAIN POINT
IF YOU HAVE A MORE RECENT VERSION PRO TOOLS LIKE SEVEN POINT AT SOME POINT ON ON GOING HAVE BEAT DETECTIVE ALREADY I'M AUTOMATICALLY INSTALLED IN YOUR PROGRAM
THE LOOP COMES DOWN AND IF YOU'RE PAINTING WITH YOUR POINT AND THUMB IT'S GOING TO SHOOT ACROSS AND HIT THE YOYO LIKE SO
SO THAT'S THE SWEET PEN TOOLS FINISHING WITH THE OF THE ANCHOR POINT TOOL
THIS ONE HAS THE HARDER SHARP POINT
THIS ONE HAS THE WEDGE POINT VERY VERY SOFT
BESIDES THAT YOU NEED TO WARM UP YOUR BODY TENNIS IS A VERY HIGH IMPACT FOR IT TO THE POINT THAT IT'S CUT ON YOUR KNEES HIGH IN YOUR ELBOWS
AND IT CAN BASICALLY IS READY TO HANG AT THAT POINT OR BE FRAMED
BEFORE YOU GET STARTED WITH MY DEMONSTRATION I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THE SIZES THAT I HAVE USED ON CANS EYE
WHAT WE JUST DID HERE WAS SCENT SOME OF THAT SANITIZER AND ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF BEER OFF INTO OUR GLASS HERE AND QUICKLY POINT THAT SIPHON ONCE AND FILL THE BEER THAT WAS PRIMED MOVE THE TWO OVER TO OUR GLASS CARBOY AND NOW WE'RE TRANSFERRING
THIS IS PLAYING TEXT AND YOU NO LONGER HAVE YOUR TABS DOWN HERE FOR ALL THOSE OPTIONS BECAUSE IT'S JUST POINT TEXT
THAT'S FIVE LETTERS THAT MAKE UP A BLEND YOU CAN START ADDING MORE AND MORE AT THIS POINT BECAUSE YOUR CHILD WILL BE VERY GOOD AT IT
THEY'RE LEVEL OF GIVING IS LOW IF YOU GIVE THE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A CARD OR A FLOWER OR A TOKEN OF SOME SORT AND THAT PERSON DOES NOT RECIPROCATED SOME POINT
YOU WANT TO CONTROL THE SET POINT SO IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE IN ATTACKING FROM HERE WE HAVE TO HAVE A PENETRATING FOOTWORK SO FOR EVERY ATTACKING TECHNIQUE YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S THE FOOTWORK
WE KNOW THAT WE WANT TO CONTROL THE SET POINT
THE SET POINT IS THAT POSITION TO WHERE I AM JUST OUTSIDE OF THIS IS WHAT I CAN STEP IN AND FIRE ON HIM AND HE CAN STEP IN AND FIRE ME
HOLDING IT SO THAT THE SINK FOLD IS ON THE BOTTOM THAT'S THE BASE OF OUR HORSE WE ARE GOING TO OPEN UP THE TAIL THE POINT THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LITTLE TRIANGLE FOLD IT DOWN
ALSO IT AS I STRIKE IN THE BAG IT'S CALLED STRIKING IT AND YOU'LL SEE ME SORT OF PUSH THE BAG WITH MY HAND TO GET THE REED STARTED HOW IT AND THEN MAKE A NICE CLEAN CUT OFF BY JUST STOPPING BREATHING IN AND SQUEEZING THE AIR OUT OF THE BAG TO THE POINT WHERE I CAN RELEASE MY ARM QUICKLY AND THAT SHUTS OFF LIKE A LIGHT SWITCH
WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON TIME TOYS SERIES ONE THE TRANSITION TO RIGHT BACK FIST AND FINISH TONGUE PLAY ONE I'LL DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU AT NORMAL SPEED THEN I'LL HAVE MELISSA PERFORM IT FOR YOU SLOW DOWN SO I CAN POINT OUT SOME OF THE FINER DETAILS PICKING IT UP FROM WHERE WE PERFORM ROLLING BLOCK RIGHT TOE KICK
SO THIS IS GOING TO BE OUR OFFENSIVE LINEMEN GO AHEAD DOWN YOUR THREE POINT STANCE IS OUR DEFENSIVE ALIGNMENT AND HIS THREE POINT STANCE
THE FENCE MIGHT BE SOMETHING I WANT TO START THINKING ABOUT AT THIS POINT
THAT IS A POINT TO FIVE MILLIMETER AND THICKNESS AND FOR TEN MILLIMETER IN LENGTH AND WE HAVE DONE THAT FROM HERE TO HERE
WHATEVER YOU DECIDE YOU WANT TO HAVE RIGHT THERE AND IT CLOSES AT THAT POINT
AT THIS POINT THE BREWING PROCESS YOU NEED TO CLEAN ALL OF YOUR EQUIPMENT BUT IN PARTICULAR IF YOU NEED TO SANITIZE WHICH IS THE ACTUAL OF CLEANING YOUR PRIMARY FERMENTER IF YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO TO THE GLASS CARBOY NEEDED TO SANITIZE YOUR FILTER AS WELL
AT THAT POINT THE PATIENT IS GENERALLY OFF PAIN MEDICINE AND COMPLETING A SHORT COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS AND STARTING TO GET BACK TO THE NORMAL ROUTINE
SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS NOT GO AND RUN OFF ON A TANGENT WITH THAT INITIAL PERCEPTION WITH OUT ASKING THE OTHER PERSON POINT BLANK IF THAT PERCEPTION IS TRUE
ONCE YOU GET BUT THAT'S THAT POINT GUARDS AREA THIS IS ALL OF HIS AREA HIS OR HER AREA
NOW DEPENDING ON HOW DEPENDING ON THE OFF IS THAT THEY'RE PLAYING AND HOW EFFECTIVE THAT OFTEN SAYS THAT WILL DETERMINE HOW FAR YOUR POINT GUARD WILL GO OUT
NOW YOU CAN SEE WHAT I'VE DONE HERE IS I'VE CREATED A TO POINT WITH THIS LINE
I THINK I CAN GO ONE BETTER BECAUSE I THINK INSTEAD OF JUST TESTING THEM AT THAT POINT AND IN THAT EXPERIENCE I CAN ALSO GIVE THEM SOME OR I CAN OPEN SOME DOORWAYS FOR THEM
THE FIRST POINT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS CROOKED POOL OR LARGE INTESTINE ELEVEN
DAMPNESS IF THE LEG TENDS TO SWELL UP ON OR IF THE DOG RESPONDS AND IS WORSE IN WORST PAINT ON DAMP DAYS THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD POINT FOR YOU TO USE
IF YOUR DOG TENDS TO BE ONE THE PANTS A LOT IS USUALLY HOT AND TIRED YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO USE THIS POINT
I'M NOT GOING TO ACTUALLY WAS REPRESENTING THE AUDIENCE OBVIOUS THAT JUST A MINUTE OF ONE POINT ON THERE
A MINOR POINT LIKE ABOUT MAJOR NEGOTIATIONS
FIND YOUR CENTER POINT AND SLOWLY ONCE AGAIN WE PUT SOME EVEN WEIGHT TO THE CENTER AND PULL OUT TOWARDS THE EDGE OF THE SAME TIME
I JUST PRACTICE THAT ONE SCRATCH AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU MIGHT WANT TO EVEN PRACTICE ONE PARTICULAR SCRATCH FOR THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF YOUR BRAKE RECORD
NOW IF WE HAVE A WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DETERMINE IS WE GOT TO DETERMINE ARE HANG POINT SO WE WANT TO DETERMINE HOW HIGH WE WANT THIS ON THE WALL
NOW THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO LOOK AT WHEN YOU'RE HANGING YOUR PICTURES YOU WANT TO LOOK ON THE BACKSIDE AND SEE WHAT TYPE OF ATTACH POINT IT HAS
AT THIS POINT WE'VE INSTALLED FOUR CHORD TO BOIL
A REALLY GOOD ABDOMINAL STRETCHES TO BRING YOUR ARMS OVER YOUR HEAD GO AHEAD AND POINT YOUR FEET STRETCH YOUR ARMS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AND STRETCH YOUR FEET
AT THAT POINT YOU'RE GOING TO SIPHON
OKAY AT THIS POINT IT'S GOING TO BE GOING INTO YOUR SECONDARY FERMENTATION
NOW I MIGHT ADD TO IT AT SOME POINT BUT WHAT I WANT TO DO IS JUST CREATE A REAL CREATE A STRAIGHT LINE AND CREATE JUST A MINIMAL CLEAN VERY CLEAN LOOK
AND BIG INHALE EXHALE AND JUST PULLING THE BAR DOWN BOOM RIGHT THERE IS A GOOD STOPPING POINT
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO POINT MYSELF UP FOR A BROAD SUBJECT FOR
AND THERE'S TWENTY SIX GRAMS OF PROTEIN AND IT'S ONLY POINT FIVE GRAMS OF FAT SO IT'S REALLY GOOD
SO SO THAT'S WHAT THOSE ARE REALLY THE ONLY RISKS FROM KIND OF THE ELECTRICAL POINT OF YOU BASICALLY NINE IF YOU'RE STAYING WITH BATTERY POWERED DEVICES
THE ONLY REAL RISK THAT THERE ISN'T WORKING WITH A CIRCUIT BOARDS FROM ELECTRONICS POINT OF VIEW IS YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT MAKE A BENDER TRY SOMETHING OUT THAT MIGHT FRY SOMETHING IN THE CIRCUIT BOARD LIKE YOU MIGHT FREYA CAPACITOR OR YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU KNOW IF YOU SEND LIKE A LOT OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE BOARD YOU KNOW TOO CLOSE TO THE POWER SOURCE OR TOO CLOSE TO YOUR CAPACITORS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
TAKING THIS FLAP WE ARE GOING TO FOLD IT FROM THIS POINT TO THIS POINT FOLD IT DOWN
SO LET'S TRY SOME POINT WITH YOU GUYS
NOW WE GET TO THIS POINT I JUST IT UP A LITTLE BIT OF START TRYING TO MAKE THIS INTO A NICE SHAPE
IF YOU'VE GONE OVER AND OVER IN YOUR HEAD WHAT'S GET WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO ALL THE WAY FROM YOUR BURN OUT TO YOUR STAGING YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN DO IT RIGHT IF YOU'VE DONE IT BEFORE AND YOU JUST REMEMBER AT THAT POINT THAT IF YOU LET YOURSELF TO IT THAT YOU'LL YOU'LL DO THE RIGHT THING
IF IT'S A PUBLIC EDUCATION A PRIVATE EDUCATION HOME EDUCATION SOMEONE HAS MADE THE DECISION OF WHAT IS IMPORTANT FOR A CHILD TO LEARN AT A CERTAIN POINT AND HOW TO TEACH IT AND WHAT IT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE OUT
SO JUST MAKE SURE YOU KEEP YOUR ELBOWS CLOSE TO YOUR BODY UP ON YOUR CONTACT THE BALL AT THIS POINT IN FRONT OF YOU
AT THAT POINT NUMBER TWO HAS THE OPTION TO TAKE NUMBER ONES GET OR GO BACK TO THE PILE AND OPEN IN YOU
IF AT THE END OF THOSE THREE ROUNDS SOMEONE HAS MORE POINTS THAN THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE IN THE GAME THAT PLAYER IS THE WINNER AND YOU GET ONE POINT FOR EACH STATE RANK THAT YOU HIT IT
LOOK AT THE FUR THIS POINT YOU CAN POSSIBLY C AND TRY AND GET THAT BALANCE AS CLEAN AS YOU CAN
SO YOU MIGHT BEGIN BY OKAY UP TEACHING YOUR DOG TO GET UP ON THE TREADMILL AND STANDING THERE AND THEN BEING ABLE TO GET BACK OFF OF THE TREADMILL THIS GIRL BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY WORK UP TO THE POINT WHERE YOU TURN THE TREADMILL ON IN YOUR DOG BEGINS TO WALK
ALWAYS SHOW THEM THE NEW SPORTS CAR AND THIS IS RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF THEM AND THEY WOULD NEVER SEE ME AT ANY POINT DURING THAT STORY
ONCE YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU ACTUALLY MAKE THE TEAM YOU MAKE YOUR HIGH SCHOOL TEAM AND YOU WANT TO EXCEL AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL
IT'LL MAKE IT THE OVERALL LOOK ELONGATED AND OBVIOUSLY WITH THESE KIND OF DRAWINGS THAT'S NOT NECESSARY BUT WITH THE DRAWING LIKE THIS AND WITH THE FASHION MODEL IT JUST SERVE TO REINFORCE THAT WHOLE POINT EVEN MORE SO AND ALMOST LIKE A CARICATURE A PERSON
HERE I HAVE A PAIR OF FLAVOR LEG PANTS THESE ARE DESIGNED IS JEANS BUT THE POINT OF HAVING FLARE LIKE PANTS IS THAT IT MAKES YOUR LEGS WITH THINNER
AND NOW AT THIS POINT I'M GOING TO LAY THIS DOWN
BUT ALL THAT REALLY HAPPENS IS ONE PERSON STARTS TELLING A STORY AND ANY TIME THEY FEEL THEY WANT TO STOP THEY'RE GOING TO JUST POINT TO SOMEONE ELSE IN THE GROUP AND THEY'RE GOING TO PICK UP WITH THE OTHER PERSON LEFT OFF
AND I GOT TO THE POINT THAT I WAS LOOKING AT THEIR EYES RUM AND LISTENING TO PLAY WITH SAYING
ADD TO IT TAKE IT AWAY AND AT SOME POINT YOU'LL GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU REALLY LIKE IT
BUT JUST PERCHANCE IF YOU MARK ONE AT TWELVE O'CLOCK AND MARK THE OTHER ONE AT THREE O'CLOCK YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO ALIGN THE THE WRONG INDEX POINT WITH THE ROLLING CAM BOWL
I'M PUSHING IN WITH THE POINT IT AREA AND GENTLY TWISTING SO THAT I DON'T HAVE TO PUSH HAVE TOO MUCH PRESSURE GOING IN WORDS AND ONCE I'VE GOT THE LARGE HOLE CUT I CAN MAKE LITTLE MARKS AT SYMMETRICAL LOCATIONS FOR THE MEAT MID GREAT SIZE AND FINALLY WITH THE SMALLEST SIZE
AN IMPORTANT GENERAL POINT FOR ANY BACK AND REAR LEG PROBLEMS IS LETTER TWENTY THREE
FIND THE SPINE AND YOU FEELS POINT STICKING UP AND THEN HOLLOWS
OBVIOUSLY THIS POINT THE BALL IS JUST THE BRAKES SO ALL YOU DON'T NECESSARILY INCREASE THE WEIGHT OF THE BALL BUT INCREASING WHICH ALL RIGHT THE POLICE
YEAH BEING A STREET CIRINO YOU HAVE BATTERY UP ALL THE PLAYERS SOMETIMES AT SOME POINT EITHER THE POINT PLAY THAT YOU USE THE OPEN STANCE
THAT WAS STARTING POINT IS GOING TO BE THE FOREGROUND COLOR OR THE BACKGROUND COLOR NO FOR COLOR IN THE ENDING POINT IS GOING TO BE BACKGROUND COLOR
GOING OKAY WE'VE GOT OUR SAUCE BOILING AT THIS POINT
WHEN YOU'RE SETTING UP A ONE THREE ONE FIRST OF ALL YOU WANT TO SET IT UP WHERE YOUR POINT GUARD IS AT THE TOP OF THE KEY AROUND THIS AREA
YOUR POINT GUARD MIGHT WANT TO COME DOWN AND BE INSIDE HERE
SO A GOOD STRONG AN AGGRESSIVE ARMPIT ATTACK IS A VERY GOOD VITAL POINT TO KNOW FOR WOMEN'S SELF DEFENSE
I WANT TO GET THEM TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WERE LET GO AND THEN THE SKATE
AND SO THE ANY WHERE THERE'S A CONTACT POINT OF METAL ON METAL OR EVEN THIS PLASTIC OR BONE THAT THAT COMPRISES THE NET IT'S THAT IT'S A PLACE WHERE THE STRING CAN BREAK
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WOULD DEALING OUT THE CARDS WHICH IS DEAL NOT REAL QUICK THEY WOULD BE A POINT IN TIME THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE FOUR CARDS IN THE KITTY PLUS THE JOKERS THAT'S THE KITTY
A LOT OF TIMES IN HIGH SCHOOL THE STUDENT DOES NOT WANT TO PUT THAT MUCH EFFORT INTO IT AND SO OF COURSE IT BECOMES MORE OF A GAME OF DISCIPLINE OR BABYSITTING AT THAT POINT YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO AT LEAST GET AN IMPROVEMENT OR AT LEAST A PASSING GRADE
RIGHT NOW IS REALLY GOOD OKAY NICE AND HIGH OFF THE BOARD YOU DID SEE A REALLY NICE TIGHT SPIN OKAY YOU SONG POINT PRIDE AND SEE HIM BUT IN THE AIR HE WAS LOOKING FOR THE WATER TO SPOT KICKED OUT NICE AND STRONG GOT GOOD EXTENSION BABY FOR THIS STRETCH THOSE ARMS A LITTLE MORE BUT THAT WAS REALLY GOOD REVERSE ONE HALF TIME
NOW AT THIS POINT YOU CAN JUST CHECK ANY THE EDGES THAT YOUR THAT AREN'T SO SMOOTH
ONE THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE THE FLOSS SINK AND ALSO THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE THE FLY RIDE CLICK POINT UP
YOU'RE GOING TO START BY BRINGING TIE ONCE AGAIN THROUGH THE KNOT AT THE END OF THIS WOULD BE TO GET INFORMATION TO YOUR FULL WINDSOR NUTT AT THIS POINT YOU BEGIN TO FROM THE BODY AND IT WITH YOUR DRAW STRING YOU BRING IT UP OR AS SUCH
YOU CAN GRAB YOUR CURVE AT ANY POINT AND PULL IT UP AND DOWN
SO THERE'S NO POINT IN POKING OR CALLISON TRYING TO DROP BLOOD
YOUR HANDS CROSS OVER THE WRIST IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH IS ON TOP OF YOUR HANDS DROP DOWN TOWARD YOUR THIGHS LIFT UP NOW YOU'RE GOING TO BEND YOUR ELBOWS AND BRING YOUR FINGERS THE POINT TO ONE ANOTHER KEEPING ABOUT A ONE TO TWO INCH GAP IN BETWEEN LIKE YOUR BLOCKING THE SUN UNDER YOUR EYES
PLEASE REMEMBER EVERY TIME YOUR CHIN COMES TO YOUR CHEST YOU ARE STRENGTHENING THOSE ABDOMINALS TO THE CHIN INTO THE CHEST SQUEEZE THOSE THAT AS YOU ROLL DOWN THE LEGS STRAIGHTEN THE TOES POINT GOING ONE VERTEBRAE AT A TIME WARM GETS A NICE ADJUSTMENTS DOING THIS
PRESET RIGHT IN HALF NOW AT THIS POINT YOU CAN EITHER FOLD IT UP LIKE THIS AND CREASE IT AND CUT ALONG THAT CREASE OR TAKE A PENCIL AND JUST RUN IT ALONG THE EDGE OF THE PAPER LIKE THAT
YOUR GOING TO BE AT A POINT WHERE BOTH OF YOU ARE GOING TO BE EVALUATING THE DIRECTION
ONCE YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU HAVE A SOFTWARE ON YOUR COMPUTER LIKE SEVENS AT THE CAN OPEN THE LOWER FILES THERE'S AN OPTION TO EXECUTE THE PROGRAM AS PART OF YOUR EXPLORE SHELL SO THAT IT WILL IN OPENING MY COMPUTER OR WINDOWS EXPLORE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO JUST RIGHT CLICK ON THE FILE AND AN ZIP IT FROM THERE UNDER OUR IT FROM THERE
SO WHEN YOU REPLACE JUST A LITTLE POINT WHEN YOU'RE REPLACING YOUR TONER GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT TO A PROPER PLACE
SO IF MY TEAM SERVES A BALL BUT AT THE OTHER TEAM GETS THE BALL AND IT PUTS IT INTO OUR SIDE OF THE COURT AND THEY GET THE POINT EVEN THOUGH THAT INSERT THE BALL AND VICE VERSA
NOW I'M GOING TO UNROLL IT AND WE'RE GOING TO WIGGLE IT IN THE DIRECTION THAT PROCESS WE CAN FIX ARE EDGES IS BECAUSE THEY'RE USUALLY GET A LITTLE BIT READY AT THIS POINT
AT THAT POINT THE CAST THE WESTERN MEDICINE USES A THE NUMBERS THAT THEY LOOK AT WILL SAY HEY OKAY NOW WE HAVE IT IN HERE
AND NOW WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO START TO DRINK THEM ALL TEN GLASS ONTO THE PREHEATED MANDREL
IT GIVES YOU A PERFECTLY ROUND HOLE BUT IT HAS A NICE SHARP POINT FOR CUTTING
NOW I AM TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT SUPER COMP OR TOP DRAGSTER AT THIS POINT BECAUSE THE BURN OUT PROCEDURES VERY DIFFERENT FOR ALL DIFFERENT CARS
AT THAT POINT I PUT IT IN NEUTRAL AND LET IT GIVE IT A QUICK JAB TO THE THROTTLE JUST TO CLEAR THE ENGINE OUT THEN YOU'LL HOLD DOWN YOU HAVE TO DO A RELEASE
AT THAT POINT IF YOU LOOK CLOSER HERE YOU ALSO GO TO THAT STEP AND MAKE A VISUAL AND PHYSICAL INSPECTION OF THE CHAMBER MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S NO ROUNDS IN THE CHAMBER
FOR HOPS WE'RE GOING TO ADD IN ONE QUICK TO FIVE OUNCES OF CRYSTAL OPPOSITE THREE POINT SIX PERCENT OUT OF ACID FOR SIXTY MINUTES
THEN THE OTHER ONE THAT I FOUND I'M GOING TO JUST CONNECT THESE ALLIGATOR CLIPS WAS THAT GLITCH POINT AND THESE ARE REALLY EXCITING
THE DIFFERENT BOT IS HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ABSORBENT SEE FROM MOISTURE AND HIGHER BOILING POINT FOR DEITY FOR COMPARE DONT THEORY
YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY NOTICE THIS AS YOU'RE BREAKING DOWN THE SCRIPT LET'S JUST GO THROUGH WITH YOUR EMPHASIZE POINT
BUT WHAT I WANT TO POINT OUT IF I MADE A IS THAT A HANDWRITING IS SO ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL
A THREE POINT LIGHTING SYSTEM IS CONSISTED OF THREE BITES
AND I WOULD TELL YOU HOW TO DO THREE POINT LIGHTING SYSTEM
BY THREE POINT LIGHTING IS THE VERY BASICS OF ALL LIGHTING IF YOU FALL THESE THINGS AND BRING YOUR INDEPENDENT FILM OR YOUR WHOLE MOVIES TO THE NEXT LEVEL
I'M ACTUALLY BEING LINT RIGHT NOW WITH THE TRADITIONAL THREE POINT LIGHTING SYSTEM
THE POINT IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE CLEANING A POOL AREA EFFECTIVELY ONE WITH AN ENCLOSURE IT IN THE NEW MORE OF LIKE AN SWEEPING MOTION ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE SWEEPING THE MONEY IN THE WATER OUT OF THE DOOR
SO YOU WANT TO TRY TO FIND YOUR HIP BONES POINT BOTH YOUR HEADLIGHTS FORWARD
POINT THREE SHOULD STAY INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF AND WHY YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE QUALIFIED TO CARRY OUT THE TASKS OF DOING YOUR SPECIFIC PLATFORM
THEN WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS CUT EACH THEM SO YOU HAVE A LITTLE POINT ON IT AGAIN AND JUST SLIP IT IN BETWEEN THE TWO LOOPS LIKE THAT
WELL THIS IS STILL SIMMERING ON A LOW FLAME AND BRING IT BACK NATURAL FRAME FLAME GOING TO START CHOPPING OUR EIGHT POINT AND THE REST OF OUR VEGETABLES
THE MAIN POINT IS THAT YOU GET THE IDEA CROSS THAT ARE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE AN AWESOME BOOK THAT PEOPLE TO READ
AT THIS POINT IN MY CONSULTATION AND WENT AHEAD AND TALK WITH MY CLIENT AND I'M GOING TO END OF USING A FIRM GEL
AGAIN PUT IN THAT POINT AND JUST CHOP STRAIGHT DOWN
I GET SWEATY FROM WHEN I GET NERVOUS NEGATE SCARE IT INTO A BASICALLY IT'S IT'S VERY STURDY DROOLING TO A POINT THE KNOT AND NOT KNOWING THE KNOWN IN KIND OF THING THAT SCARES ME IN ACTION
OUR POINT GUARDS ARE TYPICALLY ONE OF THE SMALLER GUYS IN THE OFFENSE IN OUR SHOOTING GUARDS ARE USUALLY A LITTLE BIT BIGGER
SO WHERE WE HAVE THESE PARTICULAR CURTAINS HUM JUST A COUPLE INCHES ABOUT THREE INCHES OVER THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THE ROOM LOOK TALLER SWEET ACTUALLY COME UP TO A POINT THAT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE CROWN AND THE TOP OF THE WINDOW
YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS BACK CLIMBING TO A HIGHER POINT
NOW AT THIS POINT IF I WERE JUST GOING TO RUN BACK ON THE FIELD THIS BARRELS GOOD TO GO AND THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO DO
BUT CERTAINLY THE USE OF THE HANDS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL IN ORDER TO EMPHASIZE AND ALSO SOMETIMES IN ORDER TO POINT YOURSELF INTO A CERTAIN DIRECTION AND THE SPEECH
I'VE GOT MY HIGH POINT OF THERE
SO I'M TRYING TO PICK A HIGH POINT IT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE BALL IN THE HOLE
I'LL GO UP TO THAT HIGH POINT IT AND I'LL MAKE A COUPLE PRACTICE STROKES LOOKING AT THE HOLE
AND AS YOU START TO STUDY OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK AND LEARN THAT TECHNIQUES THEY USED TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE READY TO START COMING UP WITH YOUR OWN TECHNIQUES AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T LOOK AT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THAT DONE AND YOU'RE REALLY JUST GOING TO BE RESTRICTED TO YOUR INITIAL IDEAS
AND THEN WE START BREAKING THE SILICA OFF WHICH IS VERY BRITTLE AT THIS POINT WITH SLIDES HAMMERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT TO EXPOSE THE BRONZE
AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH THIS HALF BOB AND TAKE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PART OF IT AND POINT IT UPWARDS
DO A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE POINT A LOT OF DARK CIRCLES CAN BE CAUSED FROM EITHER SINUS CONGESTION OR JUST BECAUSE THE SKIN SO THIN THERE A LOT OF BLOOD LAYING VERY CLOSE TO THE SURFACE
YOU GUYS CAN KNOTS THAT UP IF YOU STAND UP IN THE RIVER YOU CAN AND YOU PROBABLY WILL AT SOME POINT GET A FOOT ENTRAPMENT
THIS ONE OBVIOUSLY I PROBABLY NOT TO BE ABLE TO REPRODUCE UPSIDE DOWN AS WELL BUT YOU GET THE POINT
THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF STRAIGHTENERS THAT YOU CAN DO AT THIS POINT
LET ME POINT OUT WITH THESE THESE ARE SILK SHEARS
ALRIGHT LET'S DO THREE POINT LINE AGAIN GUYS
IT'S A SIX POINT FIVE IN BASICALLY THAT'S EXTRA STIFF
AND IT'S ACTUALLY AFTER THAT POINT WHIRL ADD IN THE DETAILS ADDITIONAL DETAILS LIKE ON THE COSTUME AND THE LIKE
INSTEAD OF JUST GOING IN AND DROPPING DOWN WITH A MELT WITH THIS ONE LET EVERYTHING GO REALLY SLOWLY AND CONTROL YOUR BODY AND GET TO THAT POINT REALLY REALLY SLOWLY
NOT TO THE POINT WHERE HE WOULD BE AROUND AWAY OR PROBLEM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT IT JUST DOESN'T GET IN QUITE A SNAP YOU TURN AS I WOULD LIKE AND SO THIS IS A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT CALM OVER THE POLE TIED DOWN
AND THESE ARE POINT STUDIES
AFTER THE BUTTER IS COOLED OFF IT WILL TAKE IT AND SLOWLY PORT INSIDE THE BATTER SO THAT ALL MIXED REAL GOOD TO A POINT THAT COMES OUT REAL NICE AND SMOOTH AND WHEN THE BATTER IS ALL THE TIME THE BUTTER
THE NEXT POINT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS STOMACH THIRTY SIX OR THREE MILE RUN
THE NEXT TOOL DOWN IS THE DELETE ANCHOR POINT TOOL AGAIN WE JUST WANT TO DELETE IT THAT WAY IT GOES
AND OUR FINAL TOOL IN THE PEN DRILL IS THE KIND OF THE ANCHOR POINT TOOL
SO WE GOT THE PEN TOOL UNDERNEATH THE PEN TOOL CUP THAT HAD ANCHOR POINT TOOL WHICH IS PRETTY SELF EXPLANATORY
IF WE DECIDE WHAT I HAD A POINT SIMPLY CLICK RIGHT THAT AND IF IT GETS UP SELECTION TOOL DRAG THAT OUT
AT THAT POINT SHOULD BE ABLE TO REACH INSIDE THAT TIRE AND REMOVE THE FLAT IN OR TWO
AND IT TO THE POINT WHERE IT SHOULD ALMOST LOOK FAKE
BASICALLY IT THE POINT OF THIS IS TO KEEP THE WATER TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT
NOW WE CAN HOLD THIS UP WITH ONE POINT
NOW WHEN YOU'RE STRETCHING YOU WANT TO HOLD YOUR STRETCH TO THE POINT OF MILD DISCOMFORT
SO ZOOMING OUT IS ACTUALLY IF YOU CAN PRACTICE IT TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN DO THAT ON CUE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS AND HAVE SOMETHING JUST FLOW FROM THE HEART IT'S AMAZING THE WONDERFUL THINGS THAT CAN COME OUT OF ZONING OUT
NOW THE POINT IS TO GET ALL THE CARDS UP AT THE TOP BUT IN ORDER TO GET THEM AT THE TOP YOU NEED TO HAVE AN ACE
AND SO THEN FACE CAN JUST LOWER RIGHT TO THAT POINT AND THEN BRING HER WEIGHT FORWARD AND COME RIGHT UP INTO YOUR UP DOG
SO WHAT I USUALLY GET MYSELF IN TROUBLE BECAUSE I TRY TO MAKE IT TOO THIN GOING OR NEAR THAT POINT RIGHT NOW
MAKE SURE THAT YOUR HEALTHFUL BUT NOT TO THE POINT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL OR BECOMING OVERBEARING BECAUSE ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS ABOUT OCD IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL LOOSES EVERY SENSE OF CONTROL THAT THEY HAVE ARE THEY HAD VERY LITTLE CONTROL
AT THAT POINT WHAT YOU'LL DO IS YOU WILL TAKE THE SLIDE AND PULL THE SLIDE BACK
IF YOU SEE THAT WE JUST DREW A VOLUME CHANGE AND AS A SONG PLAY IS ONCE IT GETS THAT POINT IS TO START FADING DOWN AND THEN ONCE IT GOES BACK TO THE NEXT TWO BECAUSE REBECCA ZERO
YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH PUBLISHED ONE ON LINE AT THIS POINT FOR NEXT AND NOTHING IN PEOPLE CAN ORDER YOU ACTUALLY CAN DO THAT I THINK ABOUT MACINTOSH
THE FORWARD ACTUALLY SMALL FOR WILL HAVE THIS RESPONSIBILITY I HEAR ANYTHING BEYOND THAT POINT GUARDS REACH IS ON ON THIS SIDE OF THE COURT WILL BE THAT SMALL FORWARDS RESPONSIBILITY
ON THE OTHER SIDE SAME THING WITH THE SHOOTING GUARD ANYTHING OVER THEIR PASS THE POINT I WILL BE THAT POINT THAT SHOOTING GUARDS RESPONSIBILITY
SO YOU'LL HAVE THE POINT GUARD UP TOP YOU HAVE A FORWARD RIGHT HERE A CENTER WILL BE A LITTLE FURTHER BACK BUT YOU'LL WHAT YOU'LL HAVE IS YOU HAVE A SMALL FOR HERE YOU'LL HAVE THE SHOOTING GUARD ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SUPPORT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEFENSE
THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL AS A POINT OF POINT
SO I'M RIGHT NOW AT THE HALF POINT OF AND READY TO GO AHEAD AND DESIGN MY CENTER PIECE
NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS KIND OF OPEN THIS SECTION UP HERE KIND OF GIVE IT A LITTLE ROOM AND HOLD RIGHT HERE AT THE POINT OF THE NECK
WE'RE GOING TO BASICALLY JUST KIND OF OF SQUASH SQUASH FOLD THIS BY GRABBING THIS POINT PULLING IT DOWN TO WHERE IT IS IN LINE WITH OUR WINGS SECTION HERE
SAME THING HERE OFF THIS BACK POINT AND KIND OF KEEPING IT EVEN THAT WING RIGHT THERE
NOW OPEN THE WINGS LIKE THIS AND THEN FOLD THEM DOWN PULLING OFF THIS POINT HERE GOING TO FOLD IT DOWN INTO A FORWARD FOLD
SO AT THIS POINT AS LONG AS THEY BREAK IT AWAY FROM THE STEM
WHEN I STARTED I HAVE TO USE A HAIR DRYER WHICH WAS OKAY BUT IT'S A LOT OF A OR AND NOT ENOUGH HEAT AND THEN THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED EMBOSSING GUN THAT SCREW THIS THIS SCRAP WORKERS USE AND AGAIN THAT'S TOO MUCH HEAT AND I'M NOT HERE YOU CAN WORK TO TOGETHER BUT THAT GETS TO BE A LITTLE CUMBERSOME SO AT SOME POINT YOU MIGHT INVEST IN A HEAVIER DUTY TOOL LIKE THIS
INSTEAD OF THROWING IT AWAY I TOOK SOME OF THIS LITTLE PIECES OF COPPER SLIP IT INTO THE LITTLE BENT PIECE OF THE PAN POINT AND MADE A LITTLE FOOT THAT I COULD ALSO USE WITH THE WAX
NOW A HANDY LITTLE THING IS IS THAT I THINK I SAID BEFORE THAT THIS LITTLE PIN POINT IF YOU DROP IT YOU'LL KNOW MESS UP THE POINT IT'LL BAND LIKE THIS ONE HAPPENS TO BE BENT
I SAY I'M ABOUT TWO THIRDS TO MAYBE NOT QUITE TWO THIRDS HALF WAY UP ON MY CONTAINER SO MY FIRST LASAGNA LAYER I'M GOING TO PUT THE LARGER BULBS IN BECAUSE THE POINT IS A LARGER BULBS WILL WORK UP THROUGH THE SMALLER BULBS
AND THEN DATE TODAY I WANT MY AVERAGE TO COME DOWN TO THE VERY LAST POINT
OKAY AT THIS POINT IT'S GOOD TO DO A LOT OF FLUFFING LIKE THIS AND THE TO DROP THAT TO STRAIGHTEN OUT SOME OF THE MATERIAL
EACH ROUND YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY FOR TO A POINT TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY
ON THAT CAN BE USED IN THE FRONT POINT GUARD
SO NOW WHEN I PLAY IT SHOULD BE ON POINT
WELL WE'RE HERE I ALSO LIKE TO POINT OF THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO HIT YOUR SEAT BELTS
