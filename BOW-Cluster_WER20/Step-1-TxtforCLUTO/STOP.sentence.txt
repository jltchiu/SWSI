YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE YOU KNOW WHERE THE GATE IS IF YOUR HORSE IS A FREE RUNNER THAT YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO STOP ONCE YOU GET OUT THE GATE
OR YOU USE THE MUSCLES OF THE PAIR NEON OR THE MUSCLES THAT STOP URINATION TO HOLD THEM UP ABOUT THREE LEVELS ALMOST LIKE AN ELEVATOR AND THEN RELAX THEM SLOWLY
WE KNOW THAT IF YOU MAKE A LEGAL SHOT YOU GET TO SCORE AGAIN AND GETTING TO NEW TO KEEP PLAYING SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A SCENARIO WHERE I'M STRIPES AND THIS TWO BALLS LEFT THAT I'M STILL SHOOTING I COULD DO SOMETHING WHERE I CALL THE TWELVE BALL IN THE CORNER AND TRY TO STOP THE CUE BALL HERE BECAUSE AGAIN THESE ARE GOOD AS YOU LEARN FULL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN POSITIONING AND AGAIN THIS IS A DIFFERENT VIDEO WE ARE JUST LEARNING ABOUT THIS STRATEGY OF THE GAME AND TRY TO WIN THE GAME BUT ALL I WOULD MAKE THE TWELVE THE TEN AND NOW ALL MY BALLS ARE DONE
A GOOD UTILITY MAN LIKE WILSON BOTTOM IT FOR THE NEW YORK YANKEES IS ABLE TO FILL IN AT THIRD BASE HE'S ABLE TO FILL IN A SHORT STOP SECOND BASE SOMETIMES SPELL THE FIRST BASEMAN
AS YOU PARTIALLY ROWS YOU WOULD THROW IN A BIG BUCKET OR BOILING WATER TO KILL THE E SO IT'LL STOP RISING
THE STERN LINE IS USUALLY ABOUT THE LENGTH OF THE BOAT AND IT'S USED TO TIE THE ROUGHED UP WHENEVER YOU STOP
IT'S GOOD BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU CAN REALLY INJURE YOURSELF OF A SUDDEN STOP
SO IF YOUR BIRD IS BITING THE NUMBER ONE WAY FOR YOU TO GET YOUR BIRD TO STOP BITING IS TO FIGURE OUT WHILE YOUR BIRD IS BITING AND JUST CHANGE IT SO THAT YOUR NO LONGER THREATENING THIS ANIMAL IS NO LONGER FRIGHTENED
YOU'LL ALSO GET A MAP OF THE DESTINATION AND JUST FOR THE FUN OF THE YOU GET TO SEE WHERE YOUR TRAINS GOING TO STOP ALONG THE ROOT
AND IN SOME CASES THE MANUFACTURERS STOP SELLING THAT SHE WILL ALL TOGETHER FOR INSTANCE THIS PAIR I CAN STILL GET ON A POPULAR RETAIL SITE BUT WHEN I WENT STRAIGHT TO THE MANUFACTURER TO SEE IF I CAN GET A CHEAPER THEY WON'T EVEN SELLING IT ANYMORE
IN THIS VIDEO CLIP I'LL BE SHOWING YOU HOW TO FIND PLANS FOR STOP HORSES
DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO STOP THERE WITH JUST PEARL NECKLACE
WE'RE GOING TO A STOP
I'M GOING TO PUT A BIT OF WATER IN THERE JUST STOP FRICTION
IF YOU'RE DOING THE SAME THING TIME AND TIME AGAIN EVENTUALLY THE BODY IS GOING TO STOP RESPONDING TO THIS WORKOUT
FOR THREAD ON THE WALL FOR WHAT THREE UP WHAT THREE HAT AND THAT'S OK THAT'S A PLACE WHERE WE WOULD STOP AND TALK ABOUT HOW THE ONE IN FRONT OF THE THREE FOR US RIGHT NOW WOULD'VE BEEN A FUN WAY TO PLAY IT
AND I'VE ALREADY SET THE SOFTWARE THE STOP DOWN HERE IT'S EIGHTEEN INCHES FROM THE SIDE OF THE PLAY
IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SPIN A COMPLETE ONE EIGHTY BECAUSE ONCE YOU START LEARNING THEM YOU'LL CARRY MUCH BETTER SPEED RIDING OUT BACKWARDS IF YOU SPIN IT REALLY A COMPLETE ONE EIGHTY RATHER THAN SPINNING YOU KNOW HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES OR SO WHERE YOU BASICALLY YOU'RE GOING TO LAND IN A COMPLETE STOP
BUT FOR RIGHT NOW LET'S JUST TRY IT WITH THE TOE WERE CHEATING SO REMEMBER WHEN WE STOP CHEATING YOU CAN DO THIS ANYMORE OKAY
ALL WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH OUR LEFT HAND ON THIS ONE IS USE IT TO JUST KIND OF KEEP THE BASS COMFORTABLE AND TO STOP THE STRINGS ARE AFTER WE PLAY A NOTE
SO FOR THE NEXT DOUBLE STOP WE'RE LOOKING AT THE F AND SEE SO FOR A SECOND POSITION YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE STARTING IN SECOND ON THE D STRING ON THE OF SOME CAN SLIDE IT OFF AND THE C IS RIGHT ACROSS AN F SO THIS IS GETTING A CHANCE TO LEARN PLAY DOUBLE STOP WHERE YOUR FIRST FINGER IS GOING TO PRACTICE I'M HOLDING DOWN TWO STRINGS AT ONCE ON THE FINGER PATTERN
I NEED TO MAKE SURE AND CLOSE THIS ANYTIME THAT I'VE GOT A FIRE TO AND THAT WILL STOP AND YOU WOULD IT'S ANY ANY THE PATCHES FOR POPPING AND FALLING OUT INTO THE THE WINNER
ONCE YOU GET TO THAT POINT STOP HOLD FOR THIRTY SECONDS EASE OFF OF IT AND GO BACK AGAIN AND STRETCH UNTIL YOU KNOW YOU GET TO THAT POINT WE CAN WITHSTAND THE PAINT IS YOUR HANDS YOU'RE STRETCHING IT
YOU ALSO NEED TO KNOW YOURSELF WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW WHEN YOU'RE STARTING TO LOSE CONCENTRATIONS SO YOU SHOULD STOP BEFORE YOU LOSE CONCENTRATION
JUST KIND OF WORK THAT AND SQUEEZE IT A LITTLE BIT AND RUB SOME THEN NEVER WANT YOU TO STOP AND BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT FEELS GOOD AND THAT'S HOW YOU GIVE A REALLY GOOD TO YOUR MASSAGE
STOP TOE CAN BE A PRETTY PAINFUL EXPERIENCE
THE FIRST STEP IS TO EVALUATE TO SEE IF THERE'S ACTUALLY BEEN A WOUND CREATED AFTER THE TOE HAS BEEN DAMAGED OR STOP
THAT WAS WORKING WE'VE GOT A TRASH HOW WE GOT TO STOP
NOW THE CRATE SERVES FOR A FEW PURPOSES ONE IS THAT IT STOPS AND FROM MOVING AROUND QUITE AS MUCH WHICH TO STOP THE METABOLIZE THAT THE METABOLISM IS FROM MAKE THEM HAVE TO GO TO THE BATON QUITE SO FREQUENTLY
YOU CAN STOP HER ABOUT YOU CAN USE THAT OR IF YOU CAN GET YOUR FEET CAN ALSO USE YOUR BICEPS TO PULL IN LENGTH AND YOU CAN STRETCH
YOU CAN SORT OF STOP HALF WAY TO JUST KIND OF SEE HOW THINGS ARE MAKE SURE YOU'RE STILL KIND OF SQUARE THAT YOU'RE ON TRACK
THEY HAVE A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATIONAL RESOURCES AND I CAME ACROSS THIS SET OF OLD SOME IT WOULD STOP HORSES
SO WE'RE GOING TO STOP HERE AND WE'LL PICK THIS UP IN THE NEXT
WHEN YOU PULL THE BRAKE TO STOP GO AHEAD AND LEAN FORWARD
SO TO KIND OF THUMB TO KIND OF THAT STOP THAT CAN BE SET YOUR BODY IS THIS BREEDS SLOWLY BECAUSE THAT KIND OF TAKE YOUR BODY OUT OF THE FIREFLY MOLLET WHICH IS TO BREATHE JUST FOR SHALLOW FREE COMPRESSED
YOUR BACK VERY COMFORTABLE TERRIER MIGHT NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR HERITAGE BE ABLE TO READ THE SIGNALS OTHER DOGS ARE KNOW WHEN TO STOP AND THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE PLAYING WITH OTHER DOGS WHEN THEY ARE INCLINED TO GET INTO TROUBLE
BUT IF YOU START FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WITH YOUR WITH YOUR AMERICAN THE BOLT CARRIER OF PUTTING BOUNDARIES ON THEM LETTING THEM KNOW HOW FAR THEY CAN GO STOPPING THEM WHEN YOU'RE READY TO STOP THEM AND ALWAYS REWARDING THEM FOR THE GOOD THINGS THAT THEY DO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT LIFE WITH YOUR AMERICAN PIMPLES HERE
AND SO IF YOU CATCH INCLINE WHERE THEY'RE NOT WANT AND YOU CAN EITHER TAKE SOME POINTS AND PUT THEM IN A CAN AND JUST SHAKE IT AND THE CAT WILL STOP DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING
SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO USE THIS WORKOUT AND SO WHAT YOU DO IS THAT THE CAT SHOULD LEARN THAT NO MEANS STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND CHECK IN WITH WHOEVER SET NOVEL
SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU SEE COUNSELING MARRIAGE COUNSELING AT THIS POINT BECAUSE IT IS TO STOP THE THE THE PAIN AT THAT POINT A PROFESSIONAL PERSON CAN HELP UNDERSTAND HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE CHEATING
NOW IN ORDER TO MOUNT THE SHOTGUN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO BRING THE SHOTGUN TO YOUR FACE STOP
ALRIGHT IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MAKING OUR OUR AND STOP FOR OUR TABLE SAW TAPER CUT JIG
GO AHEAD AND STOP IT ONCE THAT BASKET IS FULL THE NEXT THING THAT I DO IS SETTLE THE COFFEE WHICH IS THIS MOTION HERE AND I SAY LOOK I SELL IT USUALLY A COUPLE TIMES
I'M DOING MY POWER SNAP AND THEN MAKE THAT ABRUPT STOP
SO THAT STOP LOOKS LIKE THIS WITH THE ROD TIP
I'M DOING MY POWER SNAP MOUND PAUSE AND EVERYTHING BUT IT'S REALLY THE STOP THAT THROWS THE LINE OFF THE ROD TIP
IN THE STOP SEXY WHAT'S THROWING THE LIME OFF THE ROD TIP
STOP CLOSE PULLBACK STOP CLOSE PULL BACK
MAKE SURE THE OF THE GLOBE GO IN AND ALLOW SOME EXTRA TIME TO TURN TO STOP TO ACCELERATE NOW THOSE THINGS
THAT ACTUALLY GOING TO STOP COOKING NOW AND YOU KNOW GET TO WHERE WE NEED
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO STOP HERE PERHAPS I'M GIVING THIS TO A LITTLE GIRL AND I HAVE FOUND THAT IF YOU JUST ADD A SIMPLE PART TO ALMOST ANY CREATION YOU DRESS IT UP A LOT
THEY SAY IF YOU'RE A WHOLE STOP DIGGING
AFTER SHE STOP GOING WITH THEM THE GIRLFRIEND PICK UP ON THE GUY
IN CHINA AND A GREAT TEAS NUMBERS GRADE ONE GREAT TO CREATE THREE ONE BEING THE HIGHEST GRADE AND YOU STOP ABOUT GREAT SEVEN
AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTROL OUR SPEED TO FEED IT THROUGH THE WEDGE AND ACROSS GRIN MATCHING THE SKIS OR THROUGH THE HOCKEY STOP IN A WHITE CHART PARALLEL THAT YOU LEARN
NOW THAT I'VE GOT MY MACRO ACTIONS DONE ON A CLICK DOWN HERE AND JUST SAY STOP RECORDING AND THIS LITTLE WINDOW THAT APPEAR WHEN I BEGIN RECORD
THE LINE STOP BY ITSELF WHICH MEANS THAT THE JIG IS ON THE BOTTOM
THAT'S ALWAYS A STOP
ONE THING THAT I WOULD DO ONE IS ACTUALLY GOING TO MIX START MIXING THE WILL HELP STOP BOOM FROM ACTUALLY COOKING AND IT'S MORE LIKE A PC THE FOR NOW WITH THE VEGGIES IN THERE
IT WILL STOP IF THERE'S A TRADE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
A TENDENCY THAT PEOPLE DO HALF IS THAT THE STOP BREATHING
I'M GOING TO FEEL WHERE A STOP
ONCE THIS BECOMES ROUNDED LIKE THIS YOU STOP
VERY IMPORTANT BE BURNED AND ONCE IT'S BURN IN WHERE THIS BE COMMONS WITH THIS BECOMES A ROUNDED YOU STOP
SO THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS TO STOP BITING THE NUMBER ONE WAYS TO DISTRACT ANY OTHER NUMBER ONE WAY WOULD BE TO FIGURE OUT WIDE THE BIRD WANTS TO BITE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE AND CHANGE UP THERE AND FIREMAN
COMPANIES TO STOP TO MAKING THEM AND THEN MOVE TO WHAT'S CALLED A MIDDLEWEIGHT BICYCLE GENERALLY AROUND NINETY FIFTY THREE OR SO
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND A POINT WHERE YOU STOP AND THAT'S ACTIVE RANGE OF MOTION BOOM RIGHT THERE
HE'S GOT TO BE HERE AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING OVER AND HELPING TO STOP THAT MIDDLE OF THE DRIVE
SO WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR GARDEN YOUR MAN YOU GO ON HELP SIDE AGAIN YOU NEED TO STAY LOW DROP STEP AND KEEP THOSE GOOD WIDE STANCE IS UP OR SPRINT TO A PARTICULAR POINT TO TRY TO GET OVER AND STOP THIS GUY
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP YOU FROM LIFTING THIS HAND UP PLACE YOUR IN MOTION SO IT'S PROBABLY MORE POINT
IT'S A FUNNY FEELING WHEN THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SO SMALL AND LIGHT IT KIND OF TICKLES AS THEY MOVE ACROSS YOUR HAND BETWEEN YOUR FINGERS AND STOP TO TARGET SOME LITTLE BIT OF LOOSE SKIN
SO IF YOU WANT TO STOP AND START THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE TOO
NOW SAY THAT THE CLAY IS GOING OUT AND THERE'S A FOUL AND YOU TOUCH THE BALL BUT DO NOT GET GOOD POSSESSION THAN THE OTHER TEAM GETS IT INITIALLY THE OFFICIAL MIGHT NOT A MIGHT NOT THAT STOP IS THE THINGS YOU HAVE ADVANCE
THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS TO STOP
WHEN YOU'RE FIRST LEARNING IT'S GOOD MAYBE JUST HIT YOUR LEGS SO THAT THE STOP THAT WAY AND YOU KIND OF BUT YOU CAN ALSO EVENTUALLY LEARN TO CATCH THEM PROPERLY
THE IDEA WHAT HAPPENED THERE SO THAT SHOULD CENTER OR OPEN MY STATIONS RATHER WILL STOP THEM OFF BY ANY WILL APPLY TO THE EQUIPMENT OFFS EQUIPMENT WE'RE GOING TO LAST SECTION
RIGHT DOWN HERE YOU COULD ACTUALLY START AND PORES AND STOP SONGS
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ACTUALLY JUST PUSH STOP AND YOU COULD REALLY START THE SONG AGAIN
SO SAY YOU STOP USING TOUCH MODE YOU JUST MOVE IT TO FIX ONE LITTLE PART IT WILL CONTINUE ON READING WHAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN IN THE AUTOMATION
I WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF THE SAMPLE STOP IT WITH YOUR HAND CLOSE THE FADER AND MOVE BACK TO THE BEGINNING
WHATEVER YOU COME ACROSS A HORSE ON THE TRAIL YOU NEED TO STOP AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN
SO WE STOP
AS FAR AS SCROLLING OPTIONS THAT REALLY HELPS FIND SONGS AND AND HELPS WITH JUST A QUICKNESS OF WHERE YOUR CURSOR MIGHT BE AS FAR AS LIKE IF YOU STOP YOUR SONG YOU WANT YOUR CURSOR TO STOP RIGHT WHERE YOU STOP IT AND YOU WANT TO STOP AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE TRACK AND YOU WANT TO STOP AT A CERTAIN POINT
THIS IS AMPLE SPACE FOR YOU TO DO AT A STOP SIGN OR A RED LIGHT IN THE EVENT OR THE DOES STOP IT GIVES YOUR PLENTY OF TIME TO STOP AND KEEPS YOU A SAFE DISTANCE IN THE EVENT OF A BACK IN RELATION
NOW IN THE EVENT THAT THAT AUTOMOBILE AHEAD OF US COMES UP OUT OF THE NEXT IT ANY COMES TO A STOP SIGN OR IT COMES TO A RED LIGHT WHEN YOU DRIVE A BEHIND THIS VEHICLE DON'T COME UP TO HIM RIGHT ON HIS BUMPER STAY BACK AS FAR AS YOU WHEN YOU CAN SET IN A COMFORTABLE POSITION AND LOOK AND SEE THE BANDS OR WOMENS TIRES ON THE GROUND
THIS WILL HELP YOU STOP YOUR VEHICLE IN TIME TO PREVENT HOPEFULLY AN ACCIDENT
IN THE EVENT THAT HE DOES SOMETHING A RAG YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO STOP
WHAT I GENERALLY DO IS AGAIN FROM THERE JUST A IT PLAY FROM WHEREVER YOU CUT IT OFF THE IN THE LAST TRACK GIVE IT A GOOD YOU KNOW FIVE TO TEN SECONDS HIT STOP AND WE CAN ZERO IT OUT AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE A YOUR DIFFERENT PULLING THE TAPE BUT YOU CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND THE START RECORDING OTHER SONG
WHAT THAT DOES IS THE NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT THEY DON'T LIKE LOSING YOUR BALANCE AND SO IT'LL STOP THE BITING BEHAVIOR
AT THE END OF THAT TWO MINUTES I'M GOING TO STOP THEM TO DO SOME BASIC LUNGES
I LIKE TO DO ON MY KWANZAA LIKE TO DO ONE SIDE TIME IF I'M USING WIDTH FORTY MINUTE NIKE IN IT AND IF I CAN DO IT BECAUSE THEN OF A LOT OF PEOPLE USE CORNER TRIAL AND I DO SOMETIMES BUT A LOT OF TIMES I DON'T SIMPLY BECAUSE I JUST HAVE TAKES A LOT OF TIME FOR ME TO STOP AND GRAB THE CORNER BEAD AND START USING AND ALL THAT
SO HAVING A GOOD STOP WATCH AND THEN ASSISTANT TO HELP YOU KEEP TRACK OF IT IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA
OKAY THE NEXT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS IS A STOP WATCH
IF THAT BOXER KNOW THERE'S ONLY TEN SECONDS LEFT YOU MIGHT GET THAT EXTRA LITTLE BIT OF WIND THAT HE NEEDED TO GO BACK OUT THERE AND THEN FINISH STRONG THAN A STRONG OKAY ALSO WHEN YOU'RE WORKING IN BETWEEN IN BETWEEN THE ROUNDS IN THE CORNER IF YOU'RE IF YOUR SYSTEM CORNER MAN ALSO HAS A STOP WATCH HE CAN ALERT YOU WHEN THERE'S APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SECONDS LEFT TO THE AROUND TO THE IN BETWEEN THE AROUND
NOW I WANT YOU TO ALSO PAUSE AND STOP AT THREE O'CLOCK AND NINE O'CLOCK
THAT JOB IS TO GO AS HARD AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN THROUGH THIS GAP AND TO TRY TO GET TO THAT QUARTERBACK AND MAKE A STOP IN THE BACKFIELD
THAT MEANS IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR LINEBACKERS AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO IS PUT THEM ON ALL OUT RUN THROUGH THE LINE TO TRY TO GET TO EITHER STOP THE PLAY IN THE BACKFIELD WITH THE RUNNING BACK OR TO TRY TO GET TO A QUARTERBACK
I'M GOING TO DO NOW AS YOU CAN SEE I'M GOING TO STOP MY EYELINER AND I'M GOING TO LINE MY EYES BUT ON THE BOTTOM AND ON THE TOP
I HAVE A REALLY NICE SHOP JET BLACK PENCIL EYELINER THAT I'M GOING TO USE TO GO ON THE NICE MY EYES TO STOP WITH
SO WE'RE GOING TO STOP UNDERNEATH AND JUST KIND OF RIGHT IN THE EYE LINE ON THERE AND DO IT ON THE OTHER SIDE TOO
SO YOU KNOW YOU MAY WANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS HIGHER AND SOMEBODY THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO THE SIDING THE PAINTING AND THE CAULKING ALL THE ALL IN ONE SHOT THAT WAY YOU CAN JUST DEAL WITH ONE PERSON YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT CONTRACTORS AND YOU KNOW FOR FIVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE COMING OUT GIVING ESTIMATES AND ALL THAT YOU CAN YOU KNOW KIND OF LIKE ONE STOP SHOPPING YOU KNOW GET SOMEBODY OUT THERE THIS IS GOING TO DO IT ALL KNOW USUALLY DO IT AT A CHEAPER PRICE
ADD CURRENTLY THE QUESTION OF THE DAY IS HOW TO RESCUE A MULTI STOP
NOW IF THIS IS IS NOT TO STOP THIS MOTION TO THE BACK STRETCH THEM OUT OF WHERE THE TOSS IS A LET IT GO ON IT AND FOLLOW THROUGH
IF I CAN GO AHEAD AND STOP THAT AND DOWN HERE UNDERNEATH MARKERS IT'S GOING TO GIVE ME THE TIME COAT OF EACH MARKER
WHEN I'M PLAYING TUG I WILL PERIODICALLY HAVE MY DOG STOP AND AS SOON AS THE LET'S GO GOOD I HAVE THEM SIT LOOK UP AT ME AND THEN THAT STARTS THE GAME AGAIN
SO WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU A FULL SPEED HERE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE WHEN HE COMES OVER ON HELP SIDE TO STOP THE DRIVE
IF IT TAKES ONE MORE ADDITIONAL STEP AND GETS OVER IN FRONT OF THIS GUY EITHER ONE HE'S GOING TO STOP HIM IN MAKING PULL UP AND SHOOT A JUMP SHOT OR IF HE KEEPS GOING HE'S GOING TO GET HIT AND TAKE A CHARGE ON THE CALL
AND THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO GET OVER AND STOP THE MIDDLE DRIVE
BUT IF YOU JUST TRY TO STOP AND POWDER YOU'RE JUST GOING TO PROBABLY HIT A TREE BECAUSE THAT HAPPENS A LOT TREES OR AROUND
I HAD TO DEMONSTRATE SO I HAD TO STOP TALKING FOR A MINUTE AND YOUR CLOTHES WHAT'S MOUTH IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S MOSTLY THE SMILE THAT OLDER WOMEN IN ME AND USE
SO YOU CAN GET IN THE HEAD REALLY STRONG OR EVEN THEM THAT REALLY STOP
AND THAT'S OUR AND STOP PIECE FOR OUR TABLE SAW TAPER CUT JIG
BECAUSE IF IT SLIDES STRAIGHT INTO THE OBJECT BALL WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THE CUE BALL IS GOING TO IMPART ALL OF ITS ENERGY TO THE OBJECT BALL SENDING THE OBJECT BALL ON ITS WAY IN THE CUE BALL IS GOING TO LOSE EVERYTHING IT'S GOT GOING FOR AND IT'S GOING TO STOP DID STILL
OKAY OUR NEXT SHOT ARE ON OUR THREE MOST BASIC CUE BALL POSITION SHOTS IS THE STOP SHOT
AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF ACTION DO WE NEED TO HAVE ON THE CUE BALL ON CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT BALL IN ORDER TO GET IT TO STOP
AND I'M JUST GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO BE LOOKING FOR ON EVERY STOP SHOT REGARDLESS OF DISTANCE IS YOU WANT TO BE TRYING TO CATCH THE CUE BALL IN ITS SLIDE
SO IN ORDER TO BID BEYOND THE SIXTY LEVEL YOU NEED TO HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF MELD TO SUPPORT YOU BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU STOP IT SIXTY AND YOU ONLY HAVE TWENTY MELD YOU HAVE TO TAKE FORTY COUNTERS SO THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP AND HERE'S A SCORE SHEET AND I'LL JUST SHOW YOU WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
YOU CAN WRAP IT AROUND AND YOU CAN STOP IT AND AND KIND OF JUDGE HOW BIG YOU WANT IT
HI I'M CRAIG WEISMAN AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE THE ULTIMATE HOLIDAY STOP THERE
SOME OF THE DIFFERENCE IS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SPEEDBOAT COMPARED TO OTHER TILE STYLES BOATS CAR FOR INSTANCE WE STOP ON TEAM BUT IT'S ALSO
NOW REMEMBER THAT DOGS WILL WORK TYPICALLY WITHOUT QUITTING WHEN THEY'VE GOTTEN TO TIRED SO YOU WANT TO BE VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE OF YOUR DOG'S HEALTH THEIR HEART HEALTH AND WHEN TO STOP HOW LONG THAT THEY CAN EXERCISE AND THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THING TO WORK WITH A PROFESSIONAL AND WITH YOUR VETERINARIAN
IT'S A SUSTAINING SOUND ONE THAT DOESN'T STOP WHERE SOMEONE WHEN WE PLUCK A GUITAR
BUT ALL THAT REALLY HAPPENS IS ONE PERSON STARTS TELLING A STORY AND ANY TIME THEY FEEL THEY WANT TO STOP THEY'RE GOING TO JUST POINT TO SOMEONE ELSE IN THE GROUP AND THEY'RE GOING TO PICK UP WITH THE OTHER PERSON LEFT OFF
WE'RE HERE AND I AM I TURN AND I CAN HEAR IT SO THAT IS YOU ARE GOING TO TALK TO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT IN SLUR TWO OR TIGHT STOP AND WE'RE HERE AND HERE YOU ALMOST AN EVEN HERE THE SECOND NOW
ONE IS JUST THE SOURCE STOP AND ACTUALLY A HEARD EXPLAIN
IT DOESN'T STOP THEM FROM EATING BARKING BITING DRINKING ANYTHING
BUT AGAIN IF I'M GOING TO STOP MY CUE BALL RIGHT THERE THAT'S NOT GOING TO GIVE ME A GOOD SHOT
ON THE WHISTLE BLOWS WE LIKE YOU TO STOP ON YOUR GROUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR WITHOUT SITUATION THEN WE'LL MOVE ON DOWNSTREAM ONCE WE'VE TAKEN CARE OF IT
NOW YOU HAVE TO NUMBER ONE STOP COLORING YOUR HAIR
WHAT THIS SET UP YOU WANT TO BE SURE TO HAVE A GUARD CLAMP TO BEHIND A STOP CLAMP BEHIND THIS BOARD SO THAT WHEN THE BELL CENTERS ON HERE DOESN'T JUST FLY OFF BECAUSE THE BELT IS VERY POWERFUL TOOL AND WE'LL THROW THIS PIECE AROUND BUT WE'VE GOT THIS STOP HERE AND THAT'S GOING TO KEEP THIS IN PLACE AS WELL AS LET THE BELT SANDER GO COMPLETELY AND COVER THE WHOLE AREA OF THE PIECE OF WOOD HERE
ONCE YOU HIT THE EDDY LINE YOU CAN THEN STOP POWER ROLLING DOWN STREAM
THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT BASKETBALL IS HOW TO STOP VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO LEARN HOW TO DO THIS FIRST STEP IN BASKETBALL EITHER YOUR RIGHT HAND IN YOUR LEFT HAND AND I'M RIGHT HANDED SO I USE MY RIGHT HAND AS MY SHOOTING AT MY LEFT HAND AS MY GUIDE
YOU LET GO THIS LIMITER SWITCH AND YOU LET IT ROLL OUT YOU COME TO A STOP
SLIDE PULL THE SLIDE BACK IT DON'T LOCK BACK SO YOU WANT TO PUSH UP ON THE SLIDE STOP RIGHT ON THE SIDES ONE I PULL THE SLIDE BACK PUSH UP ON THE SLIDE STOP
SO THE EASIEST WAY TO GET RID OF WEEDS IN YOUR LAWN OR TO STOP THEM FROM SHOWING UP AT ALL IS TO JUST TAKE THE LITTLE AREAS IN YOUR YARD WHERE THERE ARE SOME WEEDS OR BLANK SPOTS AND EVERY SPRING IN THE LATE SPRING ABOUT APRIL IN THE NIGHT SO GETTING A LITTLE WARMER JUST ADD A BUNCH OF COMPOST OR POTTING SOIL ON TOP OF YOUR WEEDS AND JUST GRASS SEED
WITH FIRM CONSISTENT TRAINING WITH YOUR ADULT DOG IF YOU TEACH IMPROPER MANNERS IMPROPER OBEDIENCE YOU CAN EFFECTIVELY TEACHING TO STOP BITING
IF I DO IT AND I DON'T REALLY STOP I'M NOT REALLY PUT NEARLY AS MUCH POWER
AND ON A FAST CLOTH LIKE THIS IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE HIT RIGHT IN THE CENTER AND SLIDE ALL THE WAY OVER THAT BALL AND STOP
SO HE'S GOING TO STOP THE STRUCK JUST MAKE SURE TO STAY BEHIND THEM IN
WHEN YOU DO THAT IS TO STOP THAT FLOW OF PAINT AND THEN EVEN IT UP
NOW IF THAT DOESN'T STOP IT FROM HITTING YOUR YOUR LIP WHEN THEY THE NEXT THING TO DO IS GO AHEAD AND I'M GOING BACK TO ONE GOOD TO GO THREE CLUBS
AND I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND HAVE THE STOP RIGHT HERE
SO I'M GOING TO STOP RIGHT THERE AND LET YOU TAKE IT IN THERE
NOW YOUR REGULAR CURTAINS WILL STOP JUST SHORT OF THE FLOOR
LIFT UP TO STOP DOWN THE GOAL OF JUST
WHAT I WANT TO STOP I'M GOING TO LIFT MY TOE UP IN THE BOARD WILL COME TO A STOP
OR WE'RE FEELING SAD BECAUSE OUR PUPPY DOG DIED AND SO WE DON'T WANT TO FEEL THAT STATUS ANYMORE STOP CRYING I'LL GIVE YOU SOME TO PRY BACK OUT AND WE PUT SOME MORE STUFFING IN THE PIPE AND EVEN LESS EMOTION FLOWS THROUGH
WHAT THIS WAY REAL SLOW BOOM AND STOP MY WHICH WAY YOU GO YOU WANT TO BE A REAL SMOOTH TRANSITION FROM BEING UP TO DOWN BECAUSE THINGS DON'T NOTE UP SO USUALLY GOES TO
SO WHEN YOU FALL THAT YOUR BODY BOOM AND STOP HIM OUT THAT WAY BOOM ONE NOTE ANYWAY YOU GO BOOM
SAME WITH THE OTHER WAY YOU JUST WANT TO LET YOUR MUSCLES KIND OF RELAX AND THEN STOP AT THE END
SO THAT MEANS THE INSTEAD OF GOING BOOM AND STOPPING YOU WANT YOUR BODY ROLL REAL SLOW BOOM AND THEY COME TO A COMPLETE STOP
STOP IT'S GOING THE OTHER DIRECTION ONE
THERE'S EIGHT NINE AND WE'RE GOING TO STOP RIGHT THERE
IF THEY'RE NOT EASILY POPPING STOP THE PROCEDURE
WHEN I DID THIS HAND COMMAND IS JUST LIKE I'M GOING TO STOP TO THE DOG'S NOSE
SO IF IT'S JUST NOTE OUT AND IT'S REALLY LIGHT SNOW ON TO BE REALLY HARD TO STOP YOU KNOW IF THE SNOWS THIS DEEP YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE LUCKY THAT HAPPENS ON COLORADO IN EITHER ON HERE
IF YOU WANT TO STOP AND POWDER YOU GOTTA ALWAYS KEEP YOUR NOSE UP LEAN BACK WHICH DOUBLY HOUSE OF THREAD BOARDS AS TO BUILD THIS STANCE BACK A LITTLE BIT BUT KEEPING THOSE UP TO TRY TO THINK OF IT LIKE THAT IF YOU LOOK AND THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO STOP
YOU'LL YOU'LL TRY TO STOP AND JUST YOU KNOW ALL THE SNOW IS ON TOP YOUR BOARD AND YOU JUST END UP LIKE TOPPLING OVER SO YOU GOT TO THINK OF HOW FAST OR GOING
KIND OF GIVES US A STOP WHERE IT IS ABLE TO JUST STICK UP UP FROM THE PAPER TOWEL ROLL AND NOT BE GET LOST INSIDE INSIDE THE ROLL
NOW THE DOOR WILL STOP ON THIS LITTLE STOP RIGHT HERE IS TO STOP ON THIS SIDE
SLIDING ACTION FOR A STOP SHOT
SO WE'RE GOING TO STOP START AT THE TOP OF THE BODY AND GO THROUGH TO THE BACK OF THE BODY AND SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF MANEUVERS THAT YOU CAN DO
THEY DON'T STOP THE BALL WITH THE TWO AND THAT WILL STOP THE FACT THAT THE INDOOR AFTER BOWLS OR AFTER A RED CARDS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
YOU CAN STOP RECRUITS AND NATURE AND YOU CAN ADD SOME MORE FLAVOR AND THAT THEY HAD THE JOY TO PRUNE
AND THAT'S ANOTHER VARIATION OF THE FIRE STOP PATTERN IS IN THE KEY OF A MINOR
DO THIS TO TWENTY SECONDS TO GIVE YOURSELF ONCE YOU ONCE YOU STOP GIVE YOURSELF THAT LITTLE REST THEN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT DRILL
