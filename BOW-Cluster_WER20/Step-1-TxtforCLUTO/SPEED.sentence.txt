I'M A DENTAL AND ONCE YOU HAVE THIS REALLY LOOSE THAT MIXTURE FOR THE BIG THICK CENTER IN IT AND I DO IT LIKE THIS FOR ADDING THE MILK AND IS ACTUALLY GETTING MIXED IN FOR AS YOU GET THE BOARD IN IT'S NOT JUST FOR THE I'LL START TO BE A LOT OF THE EARLIER HOW IT'S REALLY RUNNING AROUND THE EDGES IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR CAMERA SPEED UP TO DEAL WITH THAT FOR YOU FOR THAT YOU CAN MILK AND THEN FOR THEM ALL IN THERE AT THE END RIGHT THERE'S FOR ALL YOUR INGREDIENTS IT THERE FOR YOUR A YOUR FRUIT NOTHING THIS POINT WE'RE GOING TO GO IN ABSOLUTELY LAST THOUGH IS GIVE THIS A FUNGUS COUPLE MINUTES AT THE SPEED WITH STRIP THE SIDES DOWN WE COME BACK AND FOLD IF WE CAN THAT'S IN OUR PAN READY AND THROW IT IN THE OVEN
AND SPEED IT UP YOU CAN CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF THE MOVEMENT HERE
THIS IS A NORMAL SPELL SPEED ONE SPELL CARD
OKAY ONE LAST TIME ON NORMAL SPEED
YOUR SPEED HAS TO GO TO THE BORE UNBREAKABLE
AND YOU CAN SPEED UP HERE JUST A LITTLE BIT MAKE THEM SHORT AND TINY MOVEMENTS
AGAIN DON'T SLOW IT LOOKS LIKE THIS ONE PICK THE ELBOW UP AND DRIVE THE FIST UP TO SPEED PUNCH NOT NECESSARILY USE FOR POWER SO IT'S ONE TWO
SO FULL SPEED CHEST PASS
NOW JONESY'S GOING TO DO IT FULL SPEED
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SPEED OF THE SOUTHERN OUT THE HIGHEST OF SOLDER NUMB MEDITATION
BACK AND FORTH GO AHEAD AND GO FULL SPEED FELLAS
I'LL DEMONSTRATE THIS FIRST AT NORMAL SPEED THEN I'LL HAVE MELISSA GO THROUGH IT SEVERAL TIMES SLOWING DOWN POINTING OUT SOME OF THE FINER POINTS
THE GOAL OF THE TUNNEL WILL BE TO HAVE YOUR DOG BE BALANCED WITH SPEED AND MOVEMENT TO GET THROUGH THE TUNNEL AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO GET AS MUCH SPEED AND FOLLOW THROUGH ON THIS SHOT AS POSSIBLE
THE SPEED THE CAPTIVE BEAD RING BUT SINCE I'VE DISCOVERED THAT IT DOESN'T MOVE FROM SIDE TO SIDE AS MUCH AND IT'S NOT AS MUCH IRRITATION
AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE TRYING TO CONTROL THE SPEED TO COME BACK AND JUST GENTLY NURSE IT UP IN FRONT OF THE POCKET SO THAT WE GET IT INTO THE EASY SCORING POSITION SO THAT WE CAN GO BACK AND FORTH ONCE AGAIN
YOU'LL ALSO USE THE STIR SPEED ANYTIME YOU'RE INCORPORATING INGREDIENTS INTO A BUT DOUGH OR BATTER THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE YOU DON'T WANT TO START OFF REALLY FAST AND HAVE THE INGREDIENTS FLY BACK OUT OF THE BOWL
IF YOU WANT TO INCORPORATE ALL THE INGREDIENTS NICE AND THOROUGHLY AND ALSO GET THOSE POTATOES NICE AND FLUFFY YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO USE THE FLAT PADDLE AND A SLOW SPEED
FOR THE FIRST SPEED OF THE MIXER IS STIR OR NUMBER ONE
THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS THE SPEED AND WHAT YOU WANT TO INCORPORATE MOST OF YOUR INGREDIENTS IF EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT PLAYING ON STAYING SUCH A LOW SPEED
YOUR PRIMARY BEATERS THAT YOU'LL BE USING FOR THE STIR SPEED WOULD BE YOUR DOUGH HOOK PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU'RE MAKING BREAD AND ALSO YOUR PADDLE
YOU WANT TO HAVE A NICE HIGH SPEED REALLY FOR THE LAST STAGES OF YOUR CAKE MAKING MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS WELL INCORPORATED
BE IT YOU CAN SEE HOW WELL INCORPORATED EVERYTHING AND HOW YOU HAVE A NICE BATTER IT'S VERY FLOWING AND IT'S GREAT TO HAVE IT THAT SPEED
THIS IS A NICE LIQUIDY FLOWING BATTERS SO YOU YOU CAN HAVE A HIGHER SPEED BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO CLOG THE MOTOR UP AT ALL
IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SPIN A COMPLETE ONE EIGHTY BECAUSE ONCE YOU START LEARNING THEM YOU'LL CARRY MUCH BETTER SPEED RIDING OUT BACKWARDS IF YOU SPIN IT REALLY A COMPLETE ONE EIGHTY RATHER THAN SPINNING YOU KNOW HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES OR SO WHERE YOU BASICALLY YOU'RE GOING TO LAND IN A COMPLETE STOP
NOW A LOT OF RECIPES INCLUDING US IN SOUTHERN RECIPES TINY EVERYBODY'S RAMON HAS A DIFFERENT SPEED TO SEE NOW
AND WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING IT FROM THE UP TO A FASTER SPEED THAT SOUNDS NICE AS A FOUR SOUNDS
IT'S EASY TO GET INTO THIS POSITION BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS BY ROLLING BACKWARDS WITH TOO MUCH SPEED AND YOU END UP BLOCKING OVER
SO YOU WANT TO CREATE AS MUCH CLUB HEAD SPEED ON FOR THOSE HIGH HANDICAP PLAYERS WHO HAVE TROUBLE GET THE BALL UP IN THE AIR
DROPPING IN BEING THE FIRST WHICH ACTUALLY EMULATES DETAILS THAT WHEN YOU DROP THEM IN BEING ABLE TO RIDE BACKWARDS ON YOUR SKATEBOARD A CONSTANT SPEED TO GET BACK UP TO THE COPING WHERE YOU ORIGINALLY DROP IN FRONT
THIS IS A SPEED BALL IN IT
DOING THOSE EXERCISES HELP INCREASE YOUR SPEED AND POWER IN THE DEATH MIX RUN FASTER
WITH THE PROPER TREATMENT OF REST THE APPLICATION OF ICE AND THE APPLICATION OF HEAT IF IT CAME ON GRADUALLY WILL SPEED THE HEALING AND RECOVER PROCESS
NOW THAT IS TO TAKE OUR TRAINING AND IT'S ALL ABOUT SPEED GOING TO THE BOARD IN THE BOARD CLEAN HEALTHY CHOKE
SO WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE AT FULL SPEED HERE WITH THIS GUY DRIBBLING INTO THE DEFENDER PULL IT BACK AND THEN EXPLODING ON PASS THE DEFENDER
NOW IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO PRACTICE YOUR ROUND OFF WITH SPEED AND POWER AND HEIGHT
YOU KNOW THAT YOU ACTUALLY GETTING IT YOU KNOW A BRAND NEW KITE IT'S GOT WARRANTY IT'S TOTALLY GOOD UP TO WORKING SPEED IN ORDER
SOME OF THEM HAVE CONTROL OF DOLLARS EXCUSE ME SOME OF THEM HAVE CONTROLLERS WHICH AUTOMATICALLY ADJUST THE TEMPERATURE AND OTHER IS TO SIMPLY USE A VARIABLE SPEED SORT OF POTENTIALLY ON THAT ARE DIAL AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING AT THE PIE RAW MITER WHICH TELLS YOU WHAT TEMPERATURE YOU'RE AT
I ONE ARM PUSH THIS IS THE OTHER ONE COMING BACK DOWN YOUR HIPS THE OTHER ONE STARTS THE STROKE AND THEN YOU CAN PICK UP THE SPEED IS FASTER IS SO AS YOU LIKE
NOW WHEN DOING SPEED CHUCKS IT IS IMPORTANT CAT SOUNDS KIND OF SILLY BUT YOU DO ACTUALLY NEED A WARM UP FOR ALRIGHT
FOR SPEED CHUCKS YOU GOING TO BE SPINNING AROUND YOUR FINGERS AROUND YOUR THUMBS K AROUND YOUR WRIST
SO I'VE ACTUALLY HIT MY WRIST BEFORE WHEN YOU START BUILDING UP SPEED GOING REALLY FAST
I'M HERE WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO USE SPEED CHUCKS
I HAVE A SENSE OF HOW FAST IT WOULD BE FROM HALF WAY AND THEN I TRY TO POT IT TO THAT HALFWAY POINT WITH THE RIGHT SPEED
THAT WAY YOU ALL THE IT OVER YOUR HEAD OR PICK UP TOO MUCH SPEED WITHOUT WANTING SAYS
THIS IS HOW TO DO THE G TURN ONCE YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH SPEED COMING DOWN THE BORDER SLOW TO MEDIUM PACE YOU WANT TO HEAD UP THE RAMP
SO PLAYED THE REGULAR SAY STRUM SPEED BID ONE AGAIN LIKE ALL BARRE CHORDS I'M GOING TO HAVE THE YOUR THUMB IN THE BACK OF THE MILL THE NECK REINFORCING THE BAR ON THE SIXTH FRET AND HAVE YOUR FINGERS NICE AND ARCH OVER SO YOU HEAR EVERY NOTE AND CLEANLY
THAT'S WHEN THE OVERALL DISTANCES FRESHEST IN MY MIND AND I TEND TO ROLL THE RIGHT SPEED MORE TIMES THE KNOT
ALSO IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE RUNNING FIVE TO SEVEN MILES THEN YOU WANT TO KEEP THAT WARM UP SPEED INSTEAD OF A HALF MOUNT YOU WANT TO PICK IT UP TO A MODEL AND A NICE STEADY JOG AND THEN YOU CAN INCREASE YOUR SPEED THERE AFTER
AT A POWER SCREWDRIVER THAT'S OPTIONAL I LIKE IS IN SPEED UP THINGS
WHEN YOU DO HAVE IT DOWN THE YOU WANT TO BE CONFIDENT ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN DO IT AT FULL SPEED
AND ONE THING ABOUT NIGHTTIME PHOTOGRAPHY IS IT'S LOW LIGHT SO THE SHUTTER SPEED THAT I WAS USING MIGHT BE VERY SLOW
THE SPEED IS AWAY FROM YOU THE MIDDLE PORTION IS NEXT TO YOU AND TAKE THE BOTTOM AND PULL IT TO THE TOP AND THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO DO AND MOST OF THE FOLDS
NOW ONCE YOU GET YOUR BASIC MASTERED YOU'RE GOING TO SPEED IT UP A LITTLE BIT SO YOU CAN GET SOME MOMENTUM BUILDING
THAT REGULAR SPEED IT LOOKS LIKE THIS
NOW AS MELISSA INCREASES RIGHT HER ABILITY TO STRIKE OR SPEED AND POWER RIGHT WHAT I'LL DO IS THE HAND COMES DOWN A LITTLE BIT HARDER NEXT ONE IS A MEET THE HAND OKAY MEETING THE GLASS
THIS IS A TO SPEED GRINDER
YEAH OPERATES AT A SLOW SPEED AND HIGH SPEED PALM BUT I ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY WILL OPERATE THIS BENCH GRINDER AT THE LOWER SPEED WHICH IS ABOUT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED FIFTY RPMS
THE REASON FOR USING A CARVING TURN AS OPPOSED TO THE BASIC SNOW SKIING TURN IS IT ALLOWS YOU TO CARRY MORE SPEED AND BE MORE FLUID AND IF YOU ARE PROGRESSING AND SEEN ON THIS STEEPER MORE ADVANCED SKI RUNS IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT DOWN THERE SAFELY
THE DIFFERENCE IS SET OF LANE SO MUCH PRESSURE ON THIS FOOT AND SWITCH YOUR BODY AROUND YOU'RE GOING TO PUT FOUR PRESSURE ON YOUR BOOT SO NOT ALLOW THE INSIDE EDGE OF THE SPEED WORK BY ITSELF AND CARVE THE TURN OUT
WHEN YOU'RE SHIFTING SPEED WHAT YOU DO IS YOU SHIFT THE WEIGHT TO THE FOUR PRESSURE OF THIS THROUGH AND IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU CARD THIS TURN OUT
WILL GENERALLY THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A DECAL ALONG THE TOP IT'S IS MADE IN ENGLAND AND ANOTHER THING IS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A THREE SPEED FROM SHIFTER WHAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN VALUE IN THESE TWO BIKES
FIRST OF ALL HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S AN ENGLISH THREE SPEED
SO YOU FIND AN ENGLISH THREE SPEED AND YOU WANT TO KNOW IF IT'S VALUABLE OR NOT
AGAIN HERE'S ONE SLOW ONE TWO THREE ONE A LITTLE MORE SPEED JUST LIKE THAT
AGAIN LITTLE SLOW ONE TWO THREE AND THEN ONE MORE SPEED JUST LIKE THAT
AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTROL OUR SPEED TO FEED IT THROUGH THE WEDGE AND ACROSS GRIN MATCHING THE SKIS OR THROUGH THE HOCKEY STOP IN A WHITE CHART PARALLEL THAT YOU LEARN
IN THE LAST THING WE'LL DO WANT TO DO THAT IS IS A LARGE BRUSH AND FILL IN ALL THE SPEED AREA THERE
I'M GOING TO NEED SPEED TO PERFORM THE TRICKS THAT I'M GOING TO BE TEACHING YOU IN THE REST OF THE SERIES
THE PREMISE BEHIND IT IS AT THE VINEGAR WELL ACTUALLY SPEED UP YOUR METABOLISM AND CAUSE YOU TO BURN OFF THE FOOD THAT YOU'RE EATING MUCH MORE RAPIDLY
BUT MY POINT IS AS PEOPLE TEND TO FOCUS ON THE LINE AND FORGET ABOUT THE SPEED NOT REALIZING THAT THE ODDS OF BEEN MAKING THIS POT AREN'T VERY GOOD
THE SPEED OF THE PUTT IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT THEN THIS DIRECTION
SO IF YOU DO BEGIN TO SLOW DOWN AND GET WOBBLY BEST THING TO DO IS JUST TRYING TO MAINTAIN A STEADY PEDDLING SPEED
NOW WE'LL PICK UP THE PACE AND SEE IF OUR RIDER CAN ALSO THEN PUT THAT COORDINATED EFFORT HER SHORT RAIN RIGHT HAND ON THE RAIN LEFT HAND READY TO SNAG THAT FLAG AND BRING IT ON HOME WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SPEED
SO YOU CAN SEE WITH PRACTICE THIS RIDER CAN CONTINUE TO INCREASE YOUR SPEED AS HER ACCURACY STAYED CORRECT
BUT ALSO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR LOCAL RAGE AFTER YOUR SPEED RATING ON THE TIGER YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE LOW THREE AND THE LOCAL RIGHT HERE IS AN INDEX IT NICE
I DON'T WANT TO BE CLEAR OUT HERE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE CLEAR UP TIGHT TO ME THAT FOR ME THAT SPEED FOR YOU FOR IT
SO YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT YOUR EYES SO YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT YOUR SHUTTER SPEED AS WELL YOU WANT TO SHOOT MANUAL
SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR SHUTTER SPEED YOUR APERTURE YOU WANT IT HIGHER YOUR FILM SPEED YOU WANT TO LOWER AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KEY SETTINGS ON YOUR DIGITAL SLR FOR JEWELRY PHOTOGRAPHY
SHOULD ON MANUAL AND YOU'LL HAVE TO A WORKOUT THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR WHAT YOUR THE PROPER SHUTTER SPEED IS
GET A LITTLE BIT OF SPEED STOMP ON THE NOSE AS YOU STOMP SPIN YOUR BODY THE DIRECTION THAT YOU WANT TO TURN IT ON THIS A NOLLIE FRONTSIDE WHEN IT IS THE SPIN WHERE YOU CAN SEE WHERE YOU'RE TURNING THUS MAKING IT THE EASIER THE TWO BUT IT WHEN YOU INCORPORATE THE PUSHING IN RIDING AROUND IN ALL THE OTHER PARTS OF THIS AN OLLIE ONE EIGHTY THAT YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS
DRILL IT NICE AND SLOW AND SPEED IT UP IN FRONT OF A MIRROR TO GET IT NICE AND SMOOTH
THOSE TWO FULL PASSES MEAN YOU'LL BE DRIVING YOUR CAR AT THE SPEED THAT YOU'LL BE COMPETING WITH WITHIN THOSE PARAMETERS
YOU DO YOU ACTUALLY GO FULL SPEED TO THE HALF TRACK MARK
THEN YOU HAVE THREE MODERATE PASSES WHICH ARE BASICALLY PASSES WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO FULL SPEED ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE FINISH LINE
WORK ON SOME SPEED CHUCKS
THEY'LL EASILY BE INCORPORATED WITH THE FLAT BEATER YOU'LL SEE WITH THIS ONE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE IT AT AS HIGH THE SPEED AS YOU WOULD THE WHISK
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO WHIP THINGS UP AND MAKE THE NICE AND FROTHY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE IT AT A SLOWER MORE MODERATE BEADING SPEED
SO DEPENDING ON EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE MAKING YOU CAN HAVE IT FROM NICE AND SLOW SPEED EYE UP TO A MUCH FASTER SPEED
SPEED IS ANOTHER THING TO
WATCH YOUR ENTRY SPEED AND GO AROUND AND YOU JUST WANT TO BE NICE AND SMOOTH WITH YOUR STEERING ON ON THOSE LONG SMOOTH CORNERS ALONG THE SHORT FAST CORNERS YOU CAN BE VERY VIOLIN AND JUST GET A SIDEWAYS
SO LET ME SHOW YOU ONE MORE TIME REAL SPEED
AND DURING INCLEMENT WEATHER SUCH AS RANGE SNOW SLIDERS SO ON PEEL THESE FIVE MILES BELOW THE REGULAR SPEED LIMIT
THIS IS A POWER RACE SO YOU WANT TO RUN REPEAL POWER SPEED
I'M JUST GOING TO PICK UP A LITTLE BIT OF SPEED PULL THE FRONT IN COUNTERBALANCE JUST LET IT GO
EXCELLENT HE'S FOUND IS BALL YOU NOW CAN GO AHEAD AND PLAY A SECOND SHOT AND LEAVE A HELP SPEED UP THE PACE APPLY
WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON TIME TOYS SERIES ONE THE TRANSITION TO RIGHT BACK FIST AND FINISH TONGUE PLAY ONE I'LL DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU AT NORMAL SPEED THEN I'LL HAVE MELISSA PERFORM IT FOR YOU SLOW DOWN SO I CAN POINT OUT SOME OF THE FINER DETAILS PICKING IT UP FROM WHERE WE PERFORM ROLLING BLOCK RIGHT TOE KICK
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF ETIQUETTE NOT ONLY WILL YOU HELP SPEED UP PLAY BUT YOU ALSO BE DOING YOUR PARTNER FAVOR BY HELPING AND TRY TO LOCATE IS BALL
HI MY NAME'S OTIS ST CLAIR AND TODAY I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WEIGHT TRAINING FOR INCREASE SPEED
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TWO MAIN EXERCISE THAT WE CAN DO USING WEIGHTS TO INCREASE YOUR SPEED BUILD POWER OUR LEGS AND GET FASTER
WITH SOME PURCHASES SPEEDBOAT THEY WANT TO KNOW THAT THAT BOAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO GET SOME SPEED BEHIND
WHICH IS <UNK> ON THE WATER WHICH IS RATHER FAST COMPARED TO A KAYAK OR ONTO YOUR TUGBOAT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT DESIGNED FOR SPEED
WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO START BY HITTING ALL FOUR WALLS AND THEN WE'LL ADD SOME SPOTS IN BETWEEN THAT TO SMOOTH IT OUT A LITTLE BIT AS WE SPEED IT UP
OTHER THAN THAT YOU CAN CHECK THE HARD DISC SIZE AND YOU CAN CHECK THE SPEED OF THAT ARE THAT BOOTS UP AND HOW IT SEEMS TO RUN
THERE'S A SENIOR RUNNING ACCEPTABLE SPEED TO YOU
FOR BEGINNING NINE CHUCKS BEGINNING SPEED CHUCKS OKAY
ONE MORE AND SPEED IT UP
FREQUENTLY CHILDREN WHO HERE AT DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SOMETIMES THEY DON'T LEARN IN EACH LANGUAGE AS QUICKLY BUT USING THE BABY SIGN WILL DEFINITELY BRIDGE BACK UP AND THAT WILL HELP THEM SPEED UP THE UNDERSTANDING
THERE SHOULD BE NO VISIBLE ARCH IN YOUR BODY OKAY WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW IS ARCHING SPEED NO VISIBLE ARCH IN YOUR BODY WHEN YOU'RE ENTERING THE WATER
SO WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU A FULL SPEED HERE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE WHEN HE COMES OVER ON HELP SIDE TO STOP THE DRIVE
I'LL SHOW IT TO YOU AT NORMAL SPEED AND THEY'LL BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU
BUT A LIGHTER SHAFT IN YOUR HANDS AND IT WILL CREATE THAT FASTER SWING SPEED
AND THIS IS JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO CREATE A FASHION SWING SPEED
NUMBER ONE IS YOUR FILM SPEED OR ISO
YOU GOT TO BE ABLE TO LEARN HOW TO SPIN AND GET A LOT OF SPEED A MOMENTUM BUILT UP AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE A LEMON FEET SAME TIME
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS JUST TEST WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU AT THE SPEED THAT YOU'RE ROLLING
THOSE ARE KIND OF THE DIFFERENCE IS THE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS IN THE BOAT OUT THERE THAT COMPARED TO SPEED BOATS
SPEED BUT IT'S MORE DESIGNED FOR SPEED COMFORT RIDE A FIFTY TO SIXTY MOUNT ARE PLUS I'M SPEEDS WHERE OUR PONTOONS ARE GOING TO BE MORE FOR LOUNGING LIKE YOUR LOUNGING ON YOUR COUCH WATCHING TV AT HOME GOING FIFTEEN OR TWENTY FIVE MOUSE NOW
SO YOU WANT TO THE CREAM THIS ONE MEDIUM SPEED FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES
SO WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO STAY IN THE FUN ZONE OF YOUR WHEN SPEED
REMEMBER TO SPEED TECHNIQUE
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN WHERE TO PLACE YOUR FEET ON THE BOARD YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN THE PROPER SPEED AND YOU NEED TO A NICE FLAT SMOOTH SURFACE TO TRY IT ON
START OUT SLOW IN THE WILL INCREASE THE SPEED WITH A LOT OF WORK WAS WITH YOUR BEST AND THAT IS HE'S GOING TO MOVE AROUND ACTUALLY THIS CASE I'M GOING TO MOVE AROUND AND HE'S GOING TO FOLLOW ME AROUND AND TRY AND MAINTAIN THIS POSITION
NOW WE'RE GOING TO SPEED IT UP A LITTLE BIT
LIKE IT'S A GOOD SOME GOOD SPEED
OH DEMO SPEED KIND OF THINK OF IS GOING ALONG ONLY WITH THE DYNAMICS BUT WITH THE PARTICULAR LIKE PATTERNS IN THE END THAT PART OF THE MUSIC
WE'RE GOING TO START WITH ZERO TODAY SO THAT WE SLOWLY GO THROUGH AND SHOW YOU MORE THE STRATEGY AND THEN WE'LL PICK IT UP TO BE THE SPEED
JUST START OUT AT A VERY LOW SPEED
AGAIN AIM ISN'T NEARLY AS IMPORTANT AS SPEED
WHEN YOU COME UP YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE CORRECT SPEED LIKE I TALKED ABOUT LAST CLIP
THERE'S NO PROOF THAT IT WILL SPEED OF YOUR METABOLISM ANYWAY
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW I MEAN THE FAST THE CLUB IS SPEED THE EASIER IT IS TO GET THE BALL UP IN THE AIR
THIS MACHINE ACTUALLY HAS A SPEED ADJUSTMENTS WE CAN ADJUST THE SPEED THAT I NEED TO GRIND THAT IF IF
SO UP TO SPEED WITH SOME LIKE THIS
THAT SANDY COAT WILL WANT TO BE OUT HERE A LITTLE LONGER BUT YOU KNOW THERE IS WE SPEED IT UP AND COME OVER HERE WITH THE POT PROGRAMS ON IT
NOW IMAGINE THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABOUT WHEN YOUR SPEED RUNS OUT AND YOU'VE REACHED THE END OF YOUR NOSE BLUNT SLIDE
AND HE MUST BE IN FULL SPEED WHILE PASSING THIS THE TONGUE
ALSO ANOTHER QUICK POINTER MENTION THE FALL BY ONE IS THE YOU HAVE TO GET THE BATON SAFELY AROUND THE TRUCK WHICH IS A FORM OF A LOT AND SOMETIMES THE LOCK OF SPEED COMPENSATE FOR BASIC BATON EXCHANGES
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES IT TO START SMALL AND USE YOUR SPEED SMALL PROJECTS THAT DON'T PAY WELL
ONE OF THE JUMP ROPES GOING TO BE LOOKING AT IS THE PLASTIC SPEED ROPE
SO TO PLAY IT UP TO SPEED
