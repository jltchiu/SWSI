THE TEAM THE WINDS IN THE FINAL ROUND OF THE THIRTY MINUTES IS TO CLEAR THE CHAMPION
WE'LL TRY THE OTHER SIDE JUST SO THAT WE'RE SURE THAT WE WERE CLEAR IN OUR DEMONSTRATION
AT THAT POINT WE WANT TO COME BACK AND JUST CLEAR EACH OF THE RISERS
PRIMARILY WE'RE GOING TO CLEAR THE A LINE IS GOING TO THE FRONT OF THE WING AND I'M HERE TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE CLEAN
SOME PEOPLE WHO WILL DIP THE I'M PIECES AND DO A CLEAR GLAZE AND OTHERS CHOOSE TO PAINT IT ON
I REALLY LIKE THE NONABRASIVE NEST DIPPING BECAUSE REALLY YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING THE PIECE IS A WHOLE LOT WHEN YOU ARE PAINTING YOUR CLEAR GLAZE ON WHAT CAN HAPPEN IS YOU AS SOON AS THE PIECE GETS WET YOU RE ACTIVATE THE PAINT AND ONE OF PAINTS REACTIVATED IT'S VERY EASY FOR YOU TO START MOVING IT WHEN YOU ARE BRUSHING IT ON
SO HERE WE ARE IN THE BARRACKS WHICH IS OVER ON WITH BRUTES AND NOW WE'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY TO SAVE OUR GUYS AND CLEAR THESE BRUTES OUT OF THERE
THERE WE GO AND MIX THAT UP AND LAST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS GO AND POUR THIS IN THE GLASS AND WE'RE GOING TO FLOAT OR SOME EVER CLEAR ON TOP WHICH IS GOING TO BE AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE PROOF AND CAN GO ALL THE WAY UP TO A HUNDRED EIGHTY PROOF SO IF YOU FLOAT THAT ON TOP OF FULL SHOT AND WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THIS IS IF YOU WANT YOU CAN LIGHT THAT ON FIRE AND FIND SOME WAY OF DRINKING IT
THAT A LOT OF THIS TO BECOME CLEAR AS WE GO THROUGH THE SEQUENCES OF THE ACTUAL BEAD MAKING STEPS
TYPICALLY IT TAKES ABOUT TWO WEEKS AND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WHEN YOU COME BACK TO THIS BEER IS GOING TO BE A NICE SEDIMENTATION LAYER ON THE BOTTOM AND CLEAR GEAR ABOVE THAT
THEY NEED TO EFFECTIVELY WHEN THE ENSEMBLE AND RESPECT WITH THE MUSIC AND THEY NEED TO USE CLEAR CONDUCTING GESTURES
AND THEN PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR NOSE AND LET THE BACK WHEELS PICKUP PAST THE COPING AND CLEAR IT COMPLETELY AND THEN ROLL DOWN THE TRANSITION
BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IS BE ABLE TO PUT WEIGHT ON YOUR FRONT OF YOUR BOARD OR YOUR NOSE AND ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PURPOSEFULLY PICK UP THE BACK WHEELS AND CLEAR THE COPING AND BE ABLE TO ROLL BACK DOWN THE TRANSITION AND HAVE CONTROL
ON ORNAMENTS LIKE THIS THAT ARE THE CHARACTERS I USUALLY TAKE A BOWL OF SOAPY WATER AND ONE OF CLEAR
YOU CAN AGAIN CLEAR THIS OUT IF YOU WANT TO RESTART
SO IN THE EVENT YOU NOTICE THAT YOUR TONER ISN'T PRINTING CORRECTLY AND DOWN AND YOU HAVE SOME LETTERS MISSING WILL OR IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE GO AHEAD AND GIVE YOUR TONERS SHAKE BEFORE GOING AHEAD AND REPLACING A GOOD HAND SEATING TRYING TO BUY A NEW ONE
BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO A CLEAR AREA THAT I CAN SEE THE QUITE CLEARLY
SO CHALK IS A WONDERFUL MEDIUM YOU MIGHT THINK IS VERY CHALKY BUT ONCE YOU GET IN WAS GOING TO STAND IN BETTER YOU CAN ACTUALLY JUST TAKE YOUR FIXATIVE NOW SO WORKABLE FIXATIVE AND CLEAR IT
ONCE YOU CLEAR LIP GO AND LET GO YOUR BRAKE G WALL FEATHERING AND USING YOUR WEIGHT IS BALANCED MOVE IT ALL THE WAY BACK
MAKE SURE YOU MAKE EACH DOT CLEAR
BUT THAT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT YOU CAN SEE THE THE ACTUAL CLEAR BOTTLE
THIS ONE ACTUALLY HAS CLEAR LIQUID TOP TO BOTTOM
THEY'RE ALL CLEAR JUST LIKE THIS THE BALL
BUT WET SCIENTISTS ARE AND RESEARCH ARE PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT THIS POINT IS THAT KINK STRESS JUST KIND OF HAS AN OVERALL LEG EFFECT ON YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS
SO INSTEAD OF TAKING EACH CHECK MARK OUT OF THOSE BLANK FEEL THE EASIEST THING TO DO BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE A FEW NAMES WE WANT TO USE IS TO CLEAR ALL AND EVERYTHING WILL BE EMPTY AND THEN IT'S MUCH EASIER JUST TO CHECK THE ONES THAT WE WANT INSTEAD OF GOING ALL THE WAY DOWN THE LIST AND ON CHECKING EVERYTHING
AND THAT'LL HELP THE THE IMAGE SO MUCH MORE CLEAR
I'D SAY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS WHAT LENS COLOR YOU CHOOSE A FEW BY PAIR GOGGLES I'D SAY GET THREE DIFFERENT COLORS AT LEAST CLEAR IS THE BEST FOR NIGHT AND WHEN IT'S REALLY SNOWING HARD BECAUSE THERE'S NO LIGHT REALLY THOSE TIMES
THE NEXT STEP IS TO DETERMINE THE NAIL LENGTH AND SOME NAILS ARE BLACK SOME NAILS ARE CLEAR WHICH MAKES IT A LITTLE EASIER TO IDENTIFY THE QUICK OR THE RED PART INSIDE THE NAIL
I THINK I'LL DO SOME MORE SO ANOTHER METHOD THAT I DID WAS TO TAKE A PICTURE OF THE STEPS YOU HIT A GARDEN AND THEN I COVERED THAT WITH CLEAR WAX AND IN THIS CASE I PUT DOWN SOME TISSUE PAPER AND THEN I CAN SHOW THE THREADS OF THE TISSUE PAPER THROUGH THE WAX AND COLORED ON TOP OF THAT SURFACE TO CREATE THIS EFFECT WHEN IT HITS THE HAS AN INTERESTING TRANSITION FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH TO THE WAX COATING
I DID PUT CLEAR WAX DOWN FIRST JUST LIKE WITH RUBBER STAMPS BUT I GOT THIS IMAGE WHICH WAS THE FIRST ONE I TRIED AND IT BECAME VERY POPULAR
YOU WANT TO MAKE IS TO BE AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE FROM THE BEGINNING
SO IT'S CRITICAL TO TRY AND BACK LIGHT JEWELRY IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET A PURE WHITE BACKGROUND AND THE WAY OF DOING THAT THAT I THINK THE BEST WAY OF DOING THAT IS A PIECE OF CLEAR WHITE PLEXIGLASS IT'S GOING TO ALLOW THE LIGHT TO COME THROUGH AND GIVE YOU THAT WHITE BACKGROUND WITHOUT OVEREXPOSING THE JEWELRY ITSELF
IT'S A VERY CLEAR PIECE OF PLASTIC AND THIS IS GOING TO GO OVER THE PICTURE TO PROTECT IT
WE CAN USE IT TO SEPARATE THE TOP SO WE HAVE THE CLEAR DEFINED EDGE
OTHERWISE I MADE MY OWN GLOSSY NOW BY MIXING A CLEAR WITH THE PINK OR A LIGHT PINK AND DARK PINK
SO IN THIS CASE RIGHT HERE WITH THIS BLUEBERRY PEACH WINE IT'S CLEAR IS NOT BUBBLING ANYMORE SO IT'S READY TO TAKE AND BOTTLE
AND THEN WE'LL CLEAR THE HIPS TO THE TOP TO GET THE BACK A LITTLE LOWER BACK A BREAK
THEY MUST TO HAVE THE FUZZY AFFECT THE BOTTOM AND IF I HAD TO DO NINE GLARE I'D PROBABLY DO A PIKE SAVE OVER THE GLASS IS A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEAR IT GIVES YOU A BATTER LOOK IN YOUR PICTURE
I CAN PUT THEM SIDE BY SIDE TO GIVE YOU A CLUE IS TO WHICH ONE IS MORE CLEAR
OKAY A THIS WILL TAKE A WHILE TO TAKE A FACT AND IN A COUPLE HOURS WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK HERE IN THIS PRESENTLY CLOUDY TANK IS GOING TO BE PRETTY MUCH CRYSTAL CLEAR
AND I'M WE GO TO ENJOY OUR CLEAN HEALTHY SPARKLING CLEAR AQUARIUM
SO THIS IS TO LOOK VERY CLEAR IT ACTUALLY HAS A PURPLISH TEND TO IT AND THE REASON THAT THE DONE IS THE MAIN FACTOR IS ACTUALLY I'D LIKE A FOOD COLORING MINERAL INTO THE GLAZE AND IT ACTS AS A VISUAL GUIDE TO THE BLAZERS WHO NEED TO COVER THE ENTIRE PIECE ENSURING EVERYTHING IS NICE AND SEALED WATERTIGHT AND OF COURSE FOOD SAFE
SO YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DRAG YOUR FOOT UP PUT PRESSURE ON THE NOSE POP OUT AND MAKE SURE THAT YOUR WHEELS CLEAR THE TOP OF THE OBSTACLE
I DON'T WANT TO BE CLEAR OUT HERE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE CLEAR UP TIGHT TO ME THAT FOR ME THAT SPEED FOR YOU FOR IT
START BY FINDING THE TOP EDGE OF THE SHEET AND JUST RUN YOUR HANDS ALONG THAT SO THAT IT'S ALL CLEAR
WHEN YOU FIRST START UP A WINE IT'S BUBBLING REALLY FAST SO YOU WILL YOU'LL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR BECAUSE WHEN STUFF BUBBLING AND IT'S CLEAR AS YOU CAN SEE WITH THIS WINE HERE
YOU CAN SEE LIKE GOING THROUGH IT AND VERY CLEAR
AND INTO THE COLOR COMBINATIONS IS INSIDE A CLEAR BOTTOM WHICH IS LIKE THIS ONE
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO LINE THE DOG UP FROM THE PREVIOUS AND POST OBSTACLES TO ENSURE THEY HAVE A CLEAR RUN THROUGH
AND WE'RE GOING TO USE A TWENTY GAGE CLEAR VINYL FOR THE WINDOW
WHEN THEY'RE DEMONSTRATING THE RIGHT WAY HOW TO DO AN EXERCISE THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY MAKE A CLEAR WITH OUR CLIENT THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING BEFORE THE CLIENT GOES OUT THERE AND PERFORM THE EXERCISE
IT'S CLEAR AND OPEN
AND THEN KIND OF SEE THAT I WANT TO TRY TO GET THAT GO HERE AND CLEAR AND DO HERE IS BEST I CAN DO TO GET THAT MEASUREMENT
OR YOU CAN GET A CLEAR THICK DEFINITION OF THAT WHEN YOU WANT TO CRASH LIKE TO USE THE SHOULDER THE STICK
SO YOU CAN JUST BRUSH IT OFF LIKE THAT AND THEN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR WORK SURFACE IS ALL CLEAR OF CRUMBS
NOW WHEN YOU HAVE THIS BUTTON RIGHT HERE WE CLEAR IT IS GOING TO GET RID OF IT
YOU COULD ALSO CLEAR BY PRESSING IS CLEAR PEAKS BUTTON ON THE LEFT SIDE
ALTHOUGH THE PECTORAL FINS MAY APPEAR TO BE CLEAR
SO IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE'RE GOING TO BE USING BAKING SODA SALT AND CLEAR VINEGAR
YOU GIVE IT A REALLY REALLY GOOD SHAKE TO GET ALL THE EXCESS GLAZE OFF BECAUSE YOU ONLY REALLY WANT A NICE THIN LAYER OF THE CLEAR GLAZE ON TO YOUR PIECE
NEXT WE'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO CLEAR GLAZE A BOWL
ANY GLUE THAT SQUEEZE THROUGH THE FELT AS YOU'RE PRESSING DOWN WILL DRY CLEAR IF YOU'RE USING A A WHITE GLUE REGULAR CRAFTS GLUE SO THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM
I WOULD ALSO STEER CLEAR FOR OF BLACK TOP BECAUSE IT'S TO HITTING BUT ONCE YOU HAVE THOSE THINGS SQUARED AWAY YOU'RE READY TO START BOUNCE JUGGLING
AND IT ONCE YOUR INTERVIEW IT BY THE AGENCIES THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU MAKE THEM CLEAR WHAT YOUR GOALS ARE
THE OTHER THING IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS IF IT DOESN'T FIT PROPERLY THE CONTACT LENS MOVES AROUND WHICH HENCE BRINGS THE COLOR IN TO YOUR LINE OF SIGHT SO YOU'RE NOT SEEN IS CLEARLY AS YOU WOULD WITH A CLEAR CONTACT LENSES
IF YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS BAD ENOUGH MAYBE A CLEAR CONTACT LENSES TO CUT IT SO THE COLOR ACTUALLY HELPS YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE THE CONTACT LENS IN IS YOU KNOW IS IN RELATION TO YOUR EYE IS IT MAY BE EASIER TO PUT IN
I'M GOING TO LIKE A CLEAR CANVAS
YOU WANT TO PAINT IT ON SO THAT YOUR SKIN IS COMPLETELY SMOOTHING CLEAR LIKE A WHITE PIECE OF PAPER BEFORE A PAINTER STARTS PAINTING
SO WE DON'T WANT TO BRING BACK A CAR LOAD OR TRAIN LOAD OF FOOD SO WE'RE GOING TO CLEAR THAT OUT
WE HAVE FOUR SPOONS A NICE AND EVERY COLOR ALONG WITH WHITE AND CLEAR
START OUT WITH SOME KIND OF CLEAR GLASS CONTAINER SOME THEM YOU CAN USE A SQUARE AROUND ANYTHING THAT WILL HOLD THE AMOUNT OF UTENSILS YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING
I AM JUST I REALLY LIKE WHEN I WORK ON SO ROUND I LIKE USING A LIQUID A CLEAR LIQUID IN STEAD OF PACE BECAUSE IT'S JUST EASIER TO WASH BLOODY
LIKE IN THIS ROOM WE'VE CLEARED OUT MOST EVERYTHING SO THAT IF YOU KNOW I FALL OR I SLIPPER TRIP I'M NOT GOING TO HIT MY HEAD ON A CORNER OF A COUCH OR YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO KNOCK A WHOLE BUNCH OF BOOKS OFF A SHELF OR ANYTHING EVERYTHING IS PRETTY PRETTY A CLEAR AND
NOW WORK MY WAY THROUGH THAT AREA UNTIL IT'S CLEAR AND THEN DO PART ON EACH SIDE OF THE LEG IN ON A CLEAR SECTION HERE AND I WOULD BE GOING TO A SECTION HERE
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS CLEAR AGAIN
AT THAT POINT I PUT IT IN NEUTRAL AND LET IT GIVE IT A QUICK JAB TO THE THROTTLE JUST TO CLEAR THE ENGINE OUT THEN YOU'LL HOLD DOWN YOU HAVE TO DO A RELEASE
THIS ONE IS A TWO SURGICAL BLANKET CLEAR THE CRISS CROSS THE SO WE'LL DO THOSE UP FOR IN
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AS CLEAR AS IT IS WHEN IT'S LAW
AGAIN MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS CLEAR
OKAY AND NOW THAT SHE'S COMPLETELY CLEAR FALSE COLOR IN HER SKIN IF WE CAN START WITH THE MAKEUP
BUT THE VINEGAR AND THE BAKING SODA IT'LL ACTUALLY CREATIVE FOAMING ACTION WHICH WILL GET DOWN THERE AND ACTUALLY GET OUT AROUND AND CLEAR UP THAT THAT GUNK THAT ACTUALLY COATS THE INSIDE OF THE PIPE
SO ONCE THIS IS SET FOR TEN MINUTES THEN WILL SIMPLY FOR THE BOILING WATER DOWN AND THEN AFTER WE'VE DONE ALL THAT THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO JUST RUN THE HOT TAP WATER AND RUN THIS FOR ABOUT THREE TO FIVE MINUTES JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE HAD TIME TO CLEAR EVERYTHING OUT
TO START THE PRODUCTS AND STAGE WE ENTER INTO THE CLEAR GLAZING
IT'S NICE CLEAR COLOR
SO IT'S NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR RIGHT NOW
COME UP HERE AND CREATE A SURE FIRE LIKE A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE ROW OPEN THIS LATER HOSE AND SOCKS
SO YOU WANT TO FIND A CLEAR COMFORTABLE SLAT TO PUT YOUR BUTTON INSIDE WHERE YOU CAN STAND UP FEEL COMFORTABLE BEAN STRAPPED INTO YOUR SNOWBOARD
BUT IF I'M GOING TO SET IT UP AND CLEAN IT THEN I WANT TO ACTUALLY TAKE THIS AND WITH WARM SOAPY WATER PREFERABLY WITH THE YOU KNOW RING ALL OFF WATCH THIS AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE PORTS ALONG THE BARREL SURFACE ARE CLEAN AND CLEAR OF PAINT DEBRIS
SO YOU HAVE SOME INSIDE THE CAR PUSHING DOWN THE BRAKE PEDAL AND WANTS TO HAVE THE BRAKE PEDAL DOWN ALL THE WAY THEY'LL SAY DOWN AND YOU WILL LOOSEN THIS LEADERS OFF RIGHT HERE IN THIS DIRECTION AND LIQUID WILL COME OUT THAT IS GOING TO CATCH CAN FOR THAT TO BECAUSE IT IS IN LINE IS PAINT REALLY THAT OR WHEN YOU'RE DONE JUST WIPE IT ALL OFF AND ONCE YOU'VE HAD IT SO THAT NO MORE LOOK IS COMING OUT YOU TIGHTEN IT BACK UP AND YOU TELL THEM THAT BACK UP AND THEY PUSH IT DOWN AGAIN AND YOU REPEAT THAT WHEN YOU OPEN THIS AGAIN AND LEAVE IT OUT IN PERIODICALLY MAKE SURE YOU'RE CHECKING THE MASTER CYLINDER WHICH IS WILLIE AND OPEN IT FIRST AND WE USE A TURKEY BASTER FOR FOR TAKING OUT THE FLUID AND YOU KEEP DOING THIS STEP OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON THIS PARTICULAR WE'LL UNTIL YOU GET A NEW CLEAR FLUID COMING OUT AND THIS ONE IS DONE AND YOU WOULD MOVE THE NEXT ONE IN THE BACK AND THEN USE A FROM ONES
IT CAN GIVE YOU A NICE CLEAR EDGE TO START WITH
AND THE EDGE OF THE LIP IS CLEAR
IN OTHER WORDS YOU HAVE THE KEY FACIAL FEATURES APPARENT AND CLEAR SUCH AS THE EYES EYEBROWS NOSE MOUTH CHIN AND SOME OF THE THUMB CREASES IN THE FACE AND THE FRECKLES AND SO FORTH
THE WAY THAT YOU WOULD OPENING CLEAR AND I'M LOAD THIS SQUAT THIRTY ONE WOULD BE YOU WOULD FIRST AND FOREMOST
AND IT MAKES A SUIT CLEAR
THE OTHER THING ABOUT INSTANT INCHES IN THE FORM OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WILL CLEAR YOUR WATER
SOMETHING THAT IS CLEAR DRYING
THAT IS GOING TO DRY CLEAR SO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF WE GET IT ON ANY PART OTHER PART OF OUR FISH
NOW YOU CAN GIVE THEM A CLEAR CLOT CLEAR PRECISE TIME IS IS WHEN THEY'RE COMING UP
ALMOST ALL THE BLEEDER VALVES OR ON THE TOP OF THE WHEEL AND GO BACK AND BACKING PLAY ON THE WHEEL AND THEY ALL LOOK ABOUT THE SAME AND LIKE WILL HACKS LITTLE SMALL SPOT IN THE HOLE RIGHT THERE SO YOU LOOSEN IT IS A WRENCH THEY CAN SEE THIS LID COMING OUT THAT WAY THEY TELL WHEN THE NEW FLUID IS COMING OUT IN ALL THE CLEAR THE NEW FLUID YOU CAN SEE WHEN THE OLD OLD STUFFS ALL FLESH OUT THE SYSTEM CLEANLY
SO WHENEVER ANYONE CAN PLACE OF GAS IT'S ALWAYS A CLEAR SIGN THAT THEY'VE GOT TOO MUCH BAD BACTERIA IN THEIR SYSTEM AND IT'S TIME TO START CLEARING OUT THAT BACTERIA
I'M GOING TO PULL UP NEXT TO THE CAR AND SO YOUR REAR TIRES ARE PRETTY MUCH AT THE REAR OF THE CAR THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE PARKING BEHIND AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE TURN YOUR WHEELS AND SLOWLY START BACKING UP AND THEN ONCE YOU GET ABOUT HALFWAY BACK TOWARDS THE CURB AND YOUR FRONT TIRES ARE CLEAR OF THE CAR IN FRONT OF YOU AND YOU'RE GOING TO START STIRRING BACK THE OTHER WAY AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO JUST SLIDE RIGHT IN THERE AND THE RIGHT BEHIND THE CAR
