WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE BLAST THERE AT THE BICEP GOING TO HAVE A FITTED RACE WINE
IF YOU'RE WORKING MAYBE IN AN OPEN CLUB FACE YOU HAVE YOU HAVE YOUR LEFT RACE TWO TO BEND AT THE TOP
YOUR PARTNER WOULD HAVE TO HAVE FOUR MIDDLE SPOTS AND YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE ONE AND AVOID IT JUST KEEPS PROBABLY THROUGH YOUR RACE
IF I WANT TO GET IN THE IN THAT RACE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M CATCHING IT THE FIRST DAY IT'S AVAILABLE
DO INTERVALS ESPECIALLY CLIMBING INTERVALS FOR THE OFFER TRIATHLON REPLICATE WHAT YOUR FACE IN YOUR RACE
AND THAT IS IF YOU IF YOU'RE KIND OF PERSON WHO LIKES THAT IN LIKES TALKING TO PEOPLE AND THAT'S A BONUS BUT IF YOU'RE REALLY SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO GO THAT DIRECTION YOU JUST WANT TO GO RACE GETTING YOURSELF IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU OBLIGATED TO DO THAT MIGHT BE A BAD THING
YOU TAKE ALL THE STUFF THAT YOU'VE SHOVED ON TOP OF YOUR RACE AND THEN YOU WANT TO USE THE SUSHI ROLLER TO LIFT IT UP AND COLLAPSE IT ONTO ITSELF
THIS IS A POWER RACE SO YOU WANT TO RUN REPEAL POWER SPEED
TO GO INTO OUR BIRD RACE WILL JUST GO AHEAD AND OPEN THIS UP AND PULL THIS BACK LIKE SO
IT'S A DRAW PEOPLE OVER TO YOU AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO THE GESSO BY RACE
WHEN IT COMES TO AN APPLICATION THEY WANT IF YOU'RE A BRAND NEW BEGINNER YOU'VE NEVER RACE BEFORE
SO A RACE COMING AT ME FROM BEHIND I STEP IN TO HIM OR READY
I'VE ALSO HAVE MY CLIENTS TELL ME THAT THE EXPERIENCE SOMETHING SIMILAR WHERE BY KEEPING SO FOCUSED ON THEIR EYE ON THEIR RACING MAYBE NOT EVEN THE RACE YOU COULD BE EVEN WHEN YOU'RE DOING LIKE TRAINING OR SPEAK WITH TRY OR THEY'RE A COIN OUT FOR A LONG TRAINING YOU RUN AND EXPERIENCE A A RUNNER IS KIND OF A HIGH
I'VE GOT A LITTLE DRY RACE BOARD RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THAT I ALWAYS KEEP HIM FROM MY WHEEL THAT TELLS ME THE BASIC WEIGHTS AND SIZES OF SO MY SIMPLE ITEMS BUT THIS IS A SALAD FULL
SO THIS IS MORE OF ATTACK TO PRACTICE RACE BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE
AS A DEAL TEA FIVE AND A FIVE ONE LINE AND LOWER FOR RACE CAR SO I'M GOING TO USE THOSE FOR YOUR CAR
