gk0hmh49gCQ_1 I'M SCOTT REIL ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE DOT COM OF LIGHTS TALKING ABOUT PERENNIAL GARDEN
gk0hmh49gCQ_2 WORKING WITH COLOR IN THE GARDEN IS UP IMPERATIVE IS WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PERENNIAL GARDEN
gk0hmh49gCQ_3 PERENNIAL GARDENS ARE BY THEIR NATURE I'M MOSTLY ABOUT FLOWER POWER AND FLOWERS ARE MOSTLY ABOUT COLOR
gk0hmh49gCQ_4 SO WHAT IS IN DIFFERENT WAYS TO WORK WITH COLOR IN THE GARDEN
gk0hmh49gCQ_5 YOU CAN SEE HERE AND THIS CARD NOT CHOSE THE WORK WITH SOFT COLORS
gk0hmh49gCQ_6 MOSTLY PASTEL TIGHT COLORS FROM THE SOFT PASTEL BLUE ON THE NAPE OF THE HERE THE SOFT PAINT ON THE TREES BUT IN A ROSE
gk0hmh49gCQ_7 SOFT COLORS ARE WORKING FOR ME OUT HERE
gk0hmh49gCQ_8 A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE WANT TO MIX LOTS OF DIFFERENT COLOR GARDEN AND GENERALLY I THINK THAT'S IN THE STICK
gk0hmh49gCQ_9 I CALL IT SPILLING THE PAINT BOXED BY DOES DESIGN
gk0hmh49gCQ_10 IT NEVER REALLY WORKS OUT
gk0hmh49gCQ_11 HERE I NEVER REALLY KNOWS WHERE THE FOCUS IT DOESN'T TRAVEL EASILY ARE WELL DOWN THE BORDER
gk0hmh49gCQ_12 BUT IF YOU CONTINUALLY REPLETE THE SAME PLANTS IN THE SAME COLORS THROUGHOUT IT CREATES A NICE EASY FLOW FOR THE EYE ONE THAT WORKS WELL
gk0hmh49gCQ_13 NOW YOU CAN USE HOT CALLERS IN THE GARDEN AND THAT'S AN EXCITING WEIGHTED THE DESIGN INTO BUILDER PERENNIAL GARDEN TO GO BUT IT TAKES A REALLY SKILLED LINUS KILLED HAND
gk0hmh49gCQ_14 ONE OF STAY WITH THE REDS THE YELLOWS IN THE ORANGES USING WHITES AND MAYBE THE OCCASIONAL BLUE THAT COOL THINGS DOWN A LITTLE BIT
gk0hmh49gCQ_15 BUT REMEMBERING WHERE YOU ARE AND THE COLOR WHEEL AND MATCHING MIXING YOUR COLORS APPROPRIATELY IS GONNA WORK FOR YOU IN ALL TYPES OF GARDENING BUT ESPECIALLY IN PERENNIAL GARDENING

GxvUBMfT25M_1 HI I'M CARMEN LYNNE WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
GxvUBMfT25M_2 SO THAT WE ANALYZING THIS TO A GAME THAT NEW HAS TOLD IS ABOUT I'M GOING TO EFFECT TO IT AS THE RAILROAD TRACKS DREAM
GxvUBMfT25M_3 AND IT CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT TIME OF THE NIGHT YOU USUALLY HAVE A STREAM
GxvUBMfT25M_4 OVER INNOVATIVE GO BETWEEN TEN AND TWELVE
GxvUBMfT25M_5 <UNK> IN A <UNK> FOR A FULL SLEEVE MONO FROM THE OWL A PROBABLY <UNK> COMPLETELY SLEEPING ORNAMENT THINGS WILL IN <UNK>
GxvUBMfT25M_6 HELLO I'M ON OF VESTIGE THOUGH BITLESS LISTENING <UNK>
GxvUBMfT25M_7 SO IT STAYS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
GxvUBMfT25M_8 THEN
GxvUBMfT25M_9 SO THIS MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT HIT
GxvUBMfT25M_10 SO THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IS THE PRECOGNITIVE STAGE ISN'T IT
GxvUBMfT25M_11 SO REMEMBER
GxvUBMfT25M_12 WHITE GREAT SO THAT WAS ONE THING THAT WE'VE WITH DISCOVERED NOW
GxvUBMfT25M_13 IT'S IN THE PRECOGNITIVE STAGE
GxvUBMfT25M_14 NOW THE SECOND THING I WANT TO ASK YOU IS WHAT IS THE OTHER RIDING IN MOTION THAT YOU EXPERIENCING IN THE STRING
GxvUBMfT25M_15 OUR WHEN IT'S SLIGHTLY IN A I'M IT MRIS NOVITSKY OR IN THE OR OH THIS IS REALLY IT'S IT'S VERY ARM ITS ORIGINAL INTO THE POINT OF <UNK> I'M ABOUT KNOWING THE YOUNG KNOWN IN I'M FROM THE EXCUSE ME OF HOW TO
GxvUBMfT25M_16 IN A YOU KNOW HOW INTERESTING
GxvUBMfT25M_17 SO THEY OVER RIDING IN MOTION IS ONE OF C F
GxvUBMfT25M_18 SO WE HAVE A FAYETTE A KIND OF SCARED FEELING
GxvUBMfT25M_19 AND IF THIS IS JUST TO POINT OUT THAT IT'S THE EMOTION THAT YOU EXPERIENCING IN THE DREAM WHICH IS MOST SIGNIFICANT
GxvUBMfT25M_20 BECAUSE IF YOU DO LET'S HAVE A DREAM SUCH AS THIS BUT HE DIDN'T FEELS CAN'T IF HE DIDN'T IF YOU'VE OUT COMPLETELY IN DIFFERENT MANAGING WOULD HAVE A WHOLE DIFFERENT MEANING TO HAND
GxvUBMfT25M_21 SO ON A DRUM I'M GOING TO BE LOOKING AT SOME OTHER ASPECTS OF THE DREAM HOT AND LINES THAT IS
G52icoH5-nM_1 HI I'M MICHAEL SEE THEM
G52icoH5-nM_2 IN THIS CLIP WE'LL TALK ABOUT HOW TO LIKE A PIECE OF PLEXIGLASS FROM BELOW TO ACHIEVE THE WHITE BACKGROUND FOR PIECE OF JEWELRY
G52icoH5-nM_3 SOAK WILL REDO IS INSTEAD OF HAVING THE PLEXIGLASS FLAT ON THE TABLE I JUST GOT A COUPLE PIECES OF STYROFOAM THAT DUCKING OUT OF OFF OF BOX HOLDING A OFF SOME ELECTRONIC HERE
G52icoH5-nM_4 AND I JUST PUT IT RIGHT HERE UNDERNEATH THE PLEXIGLASS
G52icoH5-nM_5 SO THAT'S OFF THE GROUND WE GOT THE JEWELRY ON TOP <UNK> AS WELL AS THE LIGHTS AND DON'T WANT IT
G52icoH5-nM_6 SOAK UP HOW WE GET A LIKE THIS UNDERNEATH
G52icoH5-nM_7 HE WE NEED TO GET A LIGHT UNDER THEIR OUGHT TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BACKLIGHT INK AND ELIMINATE THE PLEXIGLASS
G52icoH5-nM_8 SO WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS OUR LIKE IT'S KINDA GO UNDERNEATH
G52icoH5-nM_9 NOTICE I CHOSE OFF FLUORESCENTS OUT BALD BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS COOLER AS WELL THE COLOR OF THESE FLUORESCENT BALD MATCHES THE FLUORESCENT BALD IN MY OTHER TWO OVERHEAD LAMPS
G52icoH5-nM_10 AND THAT CAN MAKE GETTING THE WHITE BALANCE EASY
G52icoH5-nM_11 SO IT'S CRITICAL TO TRY AND BACKLIGHTS ODD JEWELRY A FEW TWINE GETTING A PURE WHITE BACKGROUND AND THE WAY OF DOING THAT IT I THINK THE BEST WAY OF DOING THAT IS A PIECE OF CLEAR WHITE ARE PLEXIGLASS THAT CAN ALLOW THE LIKE TO COME THROUGH AND GIVE YOU THAT WHITE BACKGROUND WITHOUT OVEREXPOSING THE JEWELRY ITSELF
GBlTwqDx5-A_1 NEXT THAT WILL BE DISCUSSING THE RAIN STICK
GBlTwqDx5-A_2 NOW HERE'S A RAIN STICK
GBlTwqDx5-A_3 THEY COME IN VARIOUS SIZES
GBlTwqDx5-A_4 NOW THIS IS TRADITIONALLY FOUND IN CHILI IN SOUTH AMERICA WHERE THIS INSTRUMENT IS USED IN CEREMONIES TO ASK FOR RAIN FROM THE GUIDES ESSENTIALLY WHERE THERE'S A DRY OUT
GBlTwqDx5-A_5 THIS INSTRUMENT WILL SIMULATE THE SOUND OF RAIN AND THEREFORE ESSENTIALLY VIA CALL THAT THE GUYS THIS IT IN THE RAIN THE COLOR
GBlTwqDx5-A_6 NOW NOWADAYS YOU CAN BE USED AS A MORE CONTEMPORARY INSTRUMENT JUST FOR ITS SOOTHING QUALITIES
GBlTwqDx5-A_7 NOW TO PLAY THIS INSTRUMENT LEAVING GET A BIGGER VERSION OF IN IS OF THAT YOU CAN PUT YOUR LITTLE BETTER
GBlTwqDx5-A_8 SAME INSTRUMENT JUST A BIT LARGER IF THEY'RE FOR THAT LOUD
GBlTwqDx5-A_9 IF YOU HIT THE SOUND OF A FUSSING LAY FLAME
GBlTwqDx5-A_10 NOW THE WAY IT WORKS IS IS A CACTUS A DEAD CACTUS WHERE THE SKIN HAS FALLEN OFF LEAVING JUST THE SHELL WHICH IS CALLED AN OR MODEL
GBlTwqDx5-A_11 NOW THE SPIKES OR LITTLE KINDS THAT ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE CACTUS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF END HAMMERED INTO THE NORM OUT HERE SO THAT THEY STAY IN TO THE EMPTY CAVITY INSIDE THE RAIN STICK
GBlTwqDx5-A_12 THE ENDS OF THE CUFF AND VERY SMALL STILLINGS OF AND PLACED IN HERE SO WHEN YOU CATCH IT BACK ON AS YOU FILL FLYING IS THAT IF THE SMALL STONES RUN INTO <UNK> TIMES OF THE CACTUS ON THE INSIDE OF FREEING THE SOUND HERE
GBlTwqDx5-A_13 NOW IF YOU LIKE EVEN ABOUT A SIXTY DEGREE ANGLE FIN ROTATE IF TO MAXIMIZE FOR THE SOUND FOR AND GET THE VEST <UNK>

-h7TLNxqxBw_11 ONCE IT'S ON PAGE CURVE WE THEN TAKE A BODY PART AND PUT IT ON C THAT FITS RIGHT
-h7TLNxqxBw_12 IF IT'S I THINLY IT'S THEN SLIDE IT AND APPLY TO ON IT SIMPLY DATA
hJCJNVBKuvs_1 NOW WE CANNOT SEES THE HEALING FUTURE TO JUSTIFY OR TEXT
hJCJNVBKuvs_2 AND TO DO THAT I HAD A CAN OF BEEF UPPER PARAGRAPHS YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE OVERDOING
hJCJNVBKuvs_3 BUT IF WE GOING HERE AND WE CAN DO PEEL LINE AND IT HAS A POSTER LEFT TRIGGER CENTER WILL JUST HAVE JUSTIFY
hJCJNVBKuvs_4 AND I WANT TO KEEP DOING THIS
hJCJNVBKuvs_5 AND THE TAKE OFF MY AND TAX
hJCJNVBKuvs_6 IF I DO TAKE OFF THE AND HAS ON THESE TWO PARAGRAPHS WILL JUSTIFY ALL THREE OF THESE PARAGRAPHS TOGETHER
hJCJNVBKuvs_7 SO WE'LL SAVE THAT
hJCJNVBKuvs_8 COME OVER HERE HIT REFRESH
hJCJNVBKuvs_9 AN OVAL WITH LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOT JUST BY
hJCJNVBKuvs_10 SO WHAT I WILL DO IS GO AHEAD AND DO THE LINE
hJCJNVBKuvs_13 IN THAT PARAGRAPH
hJCJNVBKuvs_14 AND I'LL THROW IT INTO THIS ONE TWO
hJCJNVBKuvs_15 JUST THAT HAS TO BE FINE
hJCJNVBKuvs_16 SAVE THAT IN WITH REFRESHER OVER HERE
hJCJNVBKuvs_17 NOW OTHER ALL JUST FIGHT
hJCJNVBKuvs_18 AND THEN THE NICE THING ABOUT MEAN IT GOES RIGHT THE EDGE
hJCJNVBKuvs_19 BUT YOU CAN MAKE IT WHITE OR IF YOU WANT
hJCJNVBKuvs_20 I'M MAKERS SUPER SMALL OF YOU WHY
hJCJNVBKuvs_21 THE TEXT MOVES TO COMPENSATE
HGTvZMJFiFc_1 I'M BEAU TIMKEN MASTER PSYCHICS ONLY A
HGTvZMJFiFc_2 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DIED HINGES SOCKET BUT MORE PARTICULAR AND TALK ABOUT HOW THIS BOTTLE GETS FROM SHE ZYLKA PREFECTURE TO YOU WHERE YOU LIVE WHERE YOU MIGHT BE
HGTvZMJFiFc_3 IT'S AN INTERESTING JOURNEY
HGTvZMJFiFc_4 A BREWER WIDTH FOR MEN SOCK A FOR THIRTY TO SIXTY THE STAR THIRTY TO FORTY DAYS
HGTvZMJFiFc_5 AND WHAT THEY'LL DO IS THEY'LL OUT TO REST TO SIT FROM SIX MONTHS TO ABOUT A YEAR
HGTvZMJFiFc_6 DOES WORK IT'S EXCITING
HGTvZMJFiFc_7 ONE THING PASTEURIZE IT FOR THE FINAL TIME THE PACKAGE OF THE BOTTLE IT IN THE SHIFT IT OUT
HGTvZMJFiFc_8 ON THE DATE ON EACH BOTTLE YOU HAVE A BOTTLING GATE
HGTvZMJFiFc_9 SO WHAT HAPPENS THEN IS MOST OF THE BREWERS WILL YOKOHAMA PREFECTURE WITHIN THE MAJOR SHIFTING AREAS
HGTvZMJFiFc_10 IN THE IT LOAD IT ON A CARGO SHIT IN A SHIP GOES FOR THIRTY DAYS ACROSS THE OCEAN AND ENDS UP IN EITHER THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR HOLQUIN CALIFORNIA WORE OFF AND I WOULD SAY THAT'S ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT ALL PSYCHES IMPORTED IN TO THE UNITED STATES IT'S IN AND UP THEIR WORE THEY TAKE THE LONG BOAT TO TIGHTEN IT AFTER THE PANAMA CAN OUT UP TO THE EAST COAST TO NEW JERSEY
HGTvZMJFiFc_11 SO YOU LOOK IN ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY DAYS TRAVELING AUNTS THE HIGH SCENES
HGTvZMJFiFc_12 THEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT QUARANTINE WITH A GOING SHIPPING IN
HGTvZMJFiFc_13 AND WHAT I LIKE TO SAY IS NOT A GOOD NOW BY THE TIME YOU TASTE THE SOCK EIGHT FROM ABOUT FROM FROM OR RIVAL TO YOUR WINE CHOPPER TEAR RESTAURANT IS MAYBE ANOTHER THIRTY DAYS
HGTvZMJFiFc_14 SEAL IT ABOUT SIXTY DAYS FROM JAPAN TO GET YOU LOCALLY
HGTvZMJFiFc_15 NOTHING THAT'S A PHENOMENAL THING
HGTvZMJFiFc_16 YOUR STOCK IS INCREDIBLY FRESH TODAY THAT WASN'T ALWAYS THE CASE
HGTvZMJFiFc_17 SO I GET USED TO TAKE A YEAR THEY GET FINALLY GET TO THE FINAL DESTINATION AND THIS IS DOUG UPRIGHT PRETTY DAMAGE TO BEGIN WITH
HGTvZMJFiFc_18 SOLDERED IN SUCH A GREAT DEMAND IN THE WEST THEY'VE RELEASE THAT UP PROCESS OF GETTING A BRUTE TO YOU
HGTvZMJFiFc_19 COMMON I THINK WE RECOVER THE BENEFITS BECAUSE WE'RE DRINK AND FAR BETTER FAR FRESHER FAR MORE DRINKABLE SOCK
HjM5F0tiasY_1 IT OUT AND ABOUT YES A HAND ON X THAT THING OFF AREAS ON AND BUILDING ON THEM WITH SOMETHING CONNECTED
HjM5F0tiasY_2 I NOW WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE BAD STUFF
HjM5F0tiasY_4 AND TALK ABOUT BLOCKING WHICH IS CONNELLY THE OPPOSITE OF YES AND
HjM5F0tiasY_5 LOCKING IS SAYING IN NO TWO SOMEONE'S OFF OR DENYING WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO PUT FORWARD
HjM5F0tiasY_6 AND AND I LIKE TO SAY THERE'S TWO KINDS OF BLOCKS
HjM5F0tiasY_7 AND ONE IS THE STRONG BLOCK WHERE YOUR DENYING THE REALITY THAT SOMEONE IS TRYING TO SAY
HjM5F0tiasY_8 SO IF ON IF I MADE IN OFFERING SHANNON MADE A STRONG WALK WITH I SAID AN WHICH UNLIKE THE PET MY BUNNY RABBIT
HjM5F0tiasY_9 THEN ZONE TWENTY READING
HjM5F0tiasY_10 THE THING WHEN
HjM5F0tiasY_11 PAT WOULD BE OF LOCK
HjM5F0tiasY_12 I SAY THE LAYOUT OF HE'S AS IS THE PAINTING
HjM5F0tiasY_13 HE'S DENYING THE REALITY THAT I'M TRYING TO CREATE
HjM5F0tiasY_14 THERE'S A SOFT CLOCK WHICH IS JUST BEING NEGATIVE OF GRUMPY YOUR ORANGES AND THROUGH THROUGH ABOUT ABOUT THE OFFER
HjM5F0tiasY_15 AN A AND IT PREVENTS THINGS FROM MOVING FORWARD
HjM5F0tiasY_16 SO HERE WE GO AGAIN
HjM5F0tiasY_17 WHICH IS LIKE A HAT RUNNING BUNNY RABBIT
HjM5F0tiasY_18 AND WINDOWS
HjM5F0tiasY_19 WHAT I SAID THAT I'M BLOCKING HEAVY JUST SAY NO
HjM5F0tiasY_20 WE CAN'T MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS WHOLE BUNNY RABBIT HEADING FEEDING
HjM5F0tiasY_21 SO I'M HOOD WITH THEM WITH A NEW OF IT NOW
HjM5F0tiasY_22 AND ON AN OUT WHAT WE'LL DO NOW IS JUST DO SOME QUARTER IS JUST GET INTO LINES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE SPACE
HjM5F0tiasY_23 HAVE ONE PERSON'S THAT OUT
HjM5F0tiasY_24 CHANCES THAT OUT MAKE AN OFFER AND I'M GOING TO BLOCK THAT OFF
HjM5F0tiasY_25 I COULD DO DO A STRONG BLOCK OR SOFT LOCK
HjM5F0tiasY_26 AND EVERY IN A SHUT IT DOWN
HjM5F0tiasY_27 AND I'M IN A DO THE SAME ALMOND MAKE AN OFFER HE'S CAN SHUT DOWN MY OFFER
HjM5F0tiasY_28 I'M LINDA LIVE YOU <UNK> MOVES ON THAT
HjM5F0tiasY_29 AT THE SHOE BOX
HjM5F0tiasY_30 IF I WANT YOU PREFER A DIAMOND EARRINGS ON THE CURLS
HjM5F0tiasY_31 I DON'T EVEN HIM THE YEARS
HjM5F0tiasY_33 THESE ARE BLOCKS AND EVEN FLAVOR KIND OF FUNNY
HjM5F0tiasY_34 DOESN'T CALMLY THAT COMES OUT OF BLOCKING EACH OTHER
HjM5F0tiasY_35 BUT IT'S NOT A CON ECONOMY WE WANT TO GO FORWARD DOING IMPROV
HjM5F0tiasY_36 SO ONE BECAUSE IT'S NOT VERY NICE IS COVERED KINDS YOUR FELLOW PLAYER
HjM5F0tiasY_37 IT KIND OF GETTING LAUGH OF THEIR EXPENSE HIM AGAIN LOOK DOWN
HjM5F0tiasY_38 AND THE NECK AND ONE OF PLAY WITH YOU AFTER THAT
HjM5F0tiasY_39 AND THEN BEING FUN TO PLAY WITH IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE LEARNING TO IMPROV
HjM5F0tiasY_40 ANOTHER THING IS THAT IT HAS A SHORT PAY OFF
HjM5F0tiasY_41 IT'S FUNNY THEN ADDITIONAL WE'RE REALLY AND GO AFTER THAT ON AND WE WANT TO BE A TO DEVELOP SCENES AND STORIES THAT LAST MINUTES OR OR EVEN HOURS SO WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE MOVE FORWARD IN OUR SCENES AND OPEN UP POSSIBILITIES INSTEAD OF SHEDDING THEM DOWN
HjM5F0tiasY_42 OF COURSE SOMETIMES AND THINGS YOU'RE GOING ONE O'CLOCK
HjM5F0tiasY_43 AGAIN IF THEY KNOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTER BUT IT SHOULD BE AN IMPORTANT MOMENT
HjM5F0tiasY_44 IT SHOULD BE THING NO FOR A REASON
HjM5F0tiasY_45 OFTENTIMES WE BLOCK JUST BECAUSE WE'RE FEELING NERVOUS
HjM5F0tiasY_46 WE'RE FILLING DEFENSIVE OR WE WANT A CONTROL WHAT'S GOING ON IN HER OWN IDEAS OUT THERE
HjM5F0tiasY_47 THOSE ARE GOOD REASONS TO SAY NOTE OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS
HjM5F0tiasY_48 USUALLY BLOCK OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS WOULDN'T REALLY SERVES THE STORY
HjM5F0tiasY_49 SO I THAT LITTLE DEMONSTRATION WHAT IT MEANS THE BLOCK AND DOING OF BLOCKING OFFERS CORE DOORS
g_BJceJGwzY_1 NOW WE'VE COVERED SIMPLE NIGHT BEFORE THE STEM OR UNDER FROM OR THE DOOR
g_BJceJGwzY_2 A WORD OF CAUTION PLEASE BE GENTLE ONE WHO CASE ELBOWS
g_BJceJGwzY_3 IF YOU'VE NEVER DONE THIS TECHNIQUE BEFORE YOU CAN DISLOCATE OR HYPER EXTEND DOUBLE VERY EASILY

h52yhtVXwro_4 I'VE FOUND WITH WITH CATCHING CLIENTS EVEN VERY HEAVILY TATTOOED CLIENTS BID GENERALLY SPEAKING ON THEIR IDEAS ARE VERY GOOD
h52yhtVXwro_5 IT'S LIKE ME GO INTO A PLUMBER AND TELLING THEM WHAT I THINK YOU SHOULD DO HAVE TO MAKE ALL THE PIPES WORK

h52yhtVXwro_13 LIKE YOU GOING TO BE JUST THINK ABOUT THE CONCEPT AND IN YOUR ARTIST THOSE THEN HE CAN TAKE THOSE AND GRATE SOMETHING INCREDIBLE WITH
H-Dz0oWY-O0_1 LOW YOU TALK ABOUT PUNK JEWELRY
H-Dz0oWY-O0_2 NOW THE BIGGEST MOST POPULAR THING UPON JEWELRY IS IT HAD THESE SILVER AND BLACK JEWELRY
H-Dz0oWY-O0_3 HERE I'VE GOT IT A BRACELET THAT HAS SPIKES ON IT WHICH IS ANOTHER BIG JEWELRY TREND
H-Dz0oWY-O0_4 YOU CAN ALSO SEE IT'S A BLACK LEATHER COUGH AND SILVER JEWELRY
H-Dz0oWY-O0_5 YOU DON'T REALLY SEE GOLD JEWELRY OR REALLY ANY STONE
H-Dz0oWY-O0_6 IT'S ALSO AND BLACK ON TO THIS WERE GO WITH THE METAL AND HARDWARE SOME OTHER THINGS
H-Dz0oWY-O0_7 YOU MIGHT SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS THROUGH SOMEONE THAT YOU'RE WHERE YOU MIGHT THE A GAUGE HOLE WHICH IS WHERE YOU TOOK A NORMAL HOULTON CAN THIN FIVE OF MINE AND YOU SLOWLY PUT IN LARGER LARGER EARRINGS UNTIL THE WHOLE MIGHT BE LIKE AN INCH ACROSS
H-Dz0oWY-O0_8 IN ADDITION PIERCINGS ARE INCREDIBLY POPULAR UP ON THE IN PUNK FASHION ADDED THE USE OF EVERYDAY OBJECT AS G
H-Dz0oWY-O0_9 RULER IT WERE AND TALK ABOUT LATER WITH CLOTHING HOWEVER THEY OBJECTS CAN BE USED ON THIS PIECE OF CLOTHING BUT FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SEE THAT RATHER THAN USE THE BUTTONS ON THE SHIRT I'D SAFETY PIN IT TOGETHER
H-Dz0oWY-O0_10 AND THAT THE USE OF THE SAFETY PIN IT IS PROBABLY OTHERS ARE OF SYMBOL OF PUNK BUT THE IDEA THAT A SAFETY PIN MAYBE THROUGH SOME WHEN THE EAR OR THROUGH A PIERCING OR THERE MAYBE OF DASHES OF SAFETY TENDER SOMETHING LIKE THAT
H-Dz0oWY-O0_11 USING EVERYDAY OBJECT AND MAKING IT JEWELRY WAS ANOTHER WAY THAT THE PUNK SORT OF OUR ANTI CONSUMERISM MADE FUN OF THE IDEA OF THE OF SPENDING ON THINGS LIKE JEWELRY
Gc0p6pmb6oM_1 GENERALLY SPEAKING THE EAR IS GONNA HAVE A SHAPE AS WE'VE WITH THE OTHER THING THE GENERALLY HALF A CIRCLE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_2 IT'S FLUID HERE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_3 IN LEVEL WITH THE FRONT OF THE FACE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_4 STICKS OUT FOR THE BACK
Gc0p6pmb6oM_5 THE BASIC SHAPE OF THE YEAR IS PRETTY SIMPLE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_6 IT'S NOT SOMETHING TO BE AFRAID OF
Gc0p6pmb6oM_7 EXCUSE THE MULTIPLE DRAWINGS
Gc0p6pmb6oM_8 THERE'S A LITTLE LIP HERE THAT WOULDN'T FROM LITTLE PART
Gc0p6pmb6oM_9 AND THEN THIS IS A BIG SWIRL <UNK> AND IN THAT SWIRL THERE'S TYPICALLY A SECOND AREA THAT'S KIND OF A SWIRL
Gc0p6pmb6oM_10 IT'S GOT A SHAPE LIKE THAT
Gc0p6pmb6oM_11 AND THEN THIS IS THE ACTUAL AREA THAT IS THE DEEPEST WHICH IS WHERE SOUND GOES IN
Gc0p6pmb6oM_12 THAT'S THE BASIC SHAPE OF OF OF A COMMON HERE AND IF YOU JUST GENERALLY PUT THAT IN THERE MOST PEOPLE WILL ACCEPT THAT IN A SCULPTURE AND AS SOMETHING THAT SOME BELIEVABLE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_13 NOW I'M GOING TO SWITCH TO MY OTHER MODEL CURRENT BECAUSE OF REFINED THIS YEAR A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND YOU CAN SEE THE BASIC SHAPE HOW COMPARED TO THIS WHICH HAS BEEN SHAPE YET ARE ON BUT IT FOLLOWS THE SAME BASIC PATTERN
Gc0p6pmb6oM_14 WITH THE OUTER LET THAT HERE THE INNER LIT HERE AND THIS LITTLE AREA HERE AND THE D AREA INSIDE <UNK> WHICH IS RIGHT IN THERE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_15 NOW BECAUSE THIS HAS A CAST AND NOT ON A CAR OF THIS STUFF THE BECAUSE THAT'LL CAUSE PROBLEMS WHEN I AND HOLD IT SO I'M JUST GONNA REPRESENT WITH THIS SYNTH WITH A SIMPLE APPROACH
Gc0p6pmb6oM_16 JUST LIKE IT IS AND JUST THIS THE SUGGESTION OF THIS AND THIS OUTER LIP REPRESENTING THE ENTIRE SHAPE OF THE
Gc0p6pmb6oM_17 BUT THEY'RE THE SAME WAY THEY'RE THE HOLES
Gc0p6pmb6oM_18 TO SIMPLY CARVING AWAY MOVEMENT ALIGNED APPLYING HEAT WITNESSES

gMl0CV6QweM_1 HI MY NAME'S MIKE LEWIS WITH CHRISTIAN MARTIAL ARTS
gMl0CV6QweM_2 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO SPIN AROUND BY STAFF
gMl0CV6QweM_3 THERE'S MANY MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT A BOW STUFF AROUND SAYING A CAMERA LOADS OF TO ONE
gMl0CV6QweM_4 THE BEST THING THAT IS GOING TO BACKYARD ADD TO START EXPERIMENTING AROUND WITH AS THEY WILL REALLY WORKS FOR YOU
gMl0CV6QweM_5 TO START WITH THE BASICS OBVIOUSLY DOES THE THIS ON THAT THERE'S REALLY NOT PRACTICAL BUT IT JUST LOOKS COOL
gMl0CV6QweM_6 IN A GOOD AT IT INTO YOUR FORMS WRENCH OR CAUSE OR ANYTHING THAT YOU MAKE UP IS I JUST TO TAKE THE BOAST ASPEN AROUND AND TAKE ONE HAND OFF CATCH ON THE OTHER SIDE AND JUST CONTINUE TO FLIP IT LEFT OR RIGHT HAND WHICH EVERY START OUT WITH
gMl0CV6QweM_7 I'M STARTING WITH MY LEFT HAND HERE AND A SLIPPING AROUND
gMl0CV6QweM_8 JUST MAKE SURE YOU KEEP IT NEAR THE CENTER
gMl0CV6QweM_9 IF YOU GET ALL THINGS STARTS FLATTENED OUT IS VERY EASY OR WEIGHTS CAN BE ON EVENLY DISTRIBUTED AND CROSS LOSE BY STAFF
gMl0CV6QweM_10 AND ANOTHER WAY ADDING IN STRIKES INTO SPINNING YOUR BOW STAFF <UNK> TAKE HAD THE LEFT HAND UP PALM DOWN RIGHT HAND PALM UP
gMl0CV6QweM_11 WHAT IS A TAKE ASPIRIN AND AROUND YOUR ARM ACROSS THE I LAID UP AGAINST MY BODY TO THE SIDE AND THAT'S ACTUALLY STRIKE AND OF ITSELF BUT WHEN YOU CAN TURN THAT INTO A SPIN BY TAKING IT ON FOR CROSSING YOUR ARMS CHANGING HANDS POSITIONS GUYS NOW YOUR RIGHT HAND IS PALM DOWN LEFT HAND PALM UP
gMl0CV6QweM_12 SPIN IT ACROSS OR ARMS AND LAY DOWN SOME TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER IS GO BACK AND FORTH LIKE THAT
gMl0CV6QweM_13 ONE AND A LITTLE MORE INTRICATE WITH THAT YOU BEGIN THIS CUTE
gMl0CV6QweM_14 YOU TAKE YOUR HANDS SAME POSITION RIGHT HAND PALM ALL LEFT TAMPON DOWN
gMl0CV6QweM_15 CROSS AROUND LATER BECAUSE HER BODY WHICH DO THE SCREW DOWN CHANGE OR HANDS NICE GET DOWN TO THE OTHER SIDE AND IT'S ACTUALLY CONTINUOUS SPINNING OF THOSE
gMl0CV6QweM_16 IS THAT LINE AND CHANGE THE HANDS OF THE RIGHT HAND AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE STAYING IN THE CENTER OF THE MOST THAT SO THOSE ARE JUST TO BREW BASIN WAYS VIA THIS THING A BOW STUFF AROUND AND GET STARTED
gMl0CV6QweM_17 AGAIN EXPERIMENT WITH IT
gMl0CV6QweM_18 GOT INTO BACKYARD IN TO THE TRACK
hd7AD_RfIec_1 RIGHT NOW THIS IS OUR OTHER SCENARIO
hd7AD_RfIec_2 WE DETERMINED THAT WATER LEVEL MAYBE HIM COME UP TOO HIGH THINGS RUNNING OF THE TAP THE OVERFLOW TUBE
hd7AD_RfIec_3 LET TELLS US THE BALL CAP EITHER NEEDS A NEW WASHER AND BE REBUILT OR WITHIN A CHANGE
hd7AD_RfIec_4 NOW FIRST ROOM AND CHANGE THIS ONE
hd7AD_RfIec_5 ONE AND TAKE REMOTE IN THE WE ALREADY HAVE A SHIP WATER OFF WE'RE DISCONNECTING SUPPLY ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE WALL CHI
hd7AD_RfIec_6 IN THIS CASE IT'S WITH A BRAIDED ONES VERY EASY DON'T DO
hd7AD_RfIec_7 IN THE END AND DO THE WHOLE NOW NOT HOLD BOSSHARDT FOR THE TEN
hd7AD_RfIec_8 THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS ONE GOOD THING FROM DRIVEN IN FLOOR PLEASE BE THE SEAL RIGHT THERE ON THE BLOCK
hd7AD_RfIec_9 WE TAKE THE OLD ONE OUT
hd7AD_RfIec_10 THIS IS THE COURT
hd7AD_RfIec_11 IT'S THE BARONETS BALK
hd7AD_RfIec_12 WE TAKE THE SPA CRACK BUT WHAT I REALLY LIKE IS THE MASEFIELD WALK OUT
hd7AD_RfIec_13 THIS UNIT OF ALL GRASS
hd7AD_RfIec_14 IT TAKES TO FEELS VERY QUICKLY AND IS THE QUITE IF THE BALL THE BALL CRACKS THAT YOU CAN ON
hd7AD_RfIec_15 IF YOU HAVE A TOILET NEXT WILL BEDROOM OR AN AREA THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ENJOY THAT THE QUIETNESS IN OR THE QUICK FILLING KIND OF GO FIND YOURSELF A MEANS HE'LL OR SEVENTY BULK
hd7AD_RfIec_16 A GOVERNMENT TANK TOP OF CENTER AT A FOUNTAIN UP HEITNER DOWN
hd7AD_RfIec_17 AND YOU'RE READY TO SWIM TOO LONG AGO UP WON'T RIDE BUT THAT'S NO PROBLEM
hd7AD_RfIec_18 ONE OR ON A STORE AND WILL REPLACE IT WITH A SHORTER
hd7AD_RfIec_19 AND WITH THE SINK OR DOWN
hd7AD_RfIec_20 JAB MUTE IT REQUIRES A PAIR OF CHANNEL LOCKS
hd7AD_RfIec_21 OF THEREFORE FORTIES INSULT MEDIUM SIZED PRETTY NICE
hd7AD_RfIec_22 <UNK> TANK <UNK> TO <UNK> HAND IT'S SECURE
hd7AD_RfIec_23 OR <UNK> AND IT WAS HI I'M MATT CORRECT AND IT WILL HAVE THE SOLES OF TO GO
gGpIriUEVOw_1 THE NEXT THING AND IT IS ACTUALLY MASSAGE THE ELBOW ITSELF ACTUALLY PUTTING PRESSURE ALL THE WAY AROUND NICE CIRCULAR MOTION WITH YOUR FINGERS ABOVE AND BELOW THE JOINT FRONT AND BACK ALL IT THROUGH ALONG THE FRONT OF THE LEG
gGpIriUEVOw_2 THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MAY ALSO BE A PROBLEM
gGpIriUEVOw_3 OR THE DOG WITH ELBOW DISPLAYED OR YOU MAY FIND THE DOG DOESN'T LIKE THIS MASSAGE TO START WITH IN WHICH CASE YOU WANT TO START WITH JUST SOME SOFT GENTLE MOVEMENT JUST MOVE YOUR HANDS OVER THE SKIN DON'T PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON AND GRADUALLY WORK YOUR WAY UP
gGpIriUEVOw_4 IF YOU FEEL HE IN THE JOINT YOU MAY FIND THAT THE DOG WILL ALSO OBJECTIVE IT AND IN THOSE CASES JUST DON'T DO AS MUCH OF IT JUST DO A MINUTE OR TWO SEE LITTLE TOLERATE AND THEN TRY AGAIN THE NEXT TIME DOING A SESSION AND GRADUALLY WORK YOUR WAY UP YOU FIND THAT THIS WILL GET EASIER AS YOU'VE WORKED FOR THE ANIMAL AND THE GENERAL ENERGY IS FLOWING AND SOME OF THE STIFFNESS IS REALLY THAN THAT IN THE MORE LIKELY TO TOLERATE THIS PARTICULAR AREA BEING SAUSAGE
hIubyjPBr4A_1 A KITTEN EXCEPT THAT WERE TO DO IS ACTUALLY STARTED TACTIC SOME OF THE STUFF TOGETHER BEFORE WE'RE ABLE TO HANG IT OUT
hIubyjPBr4A_2 I ALWAYS LIKE TO RIFF CYCLE EVERYTHING GUNK POSSIBLY CAN SO I'LL TAKE THIS THE ENDS OF UP OUR FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS I DON'T USE AND CUT OFF AND AND USE THIS FOR TOLLS
hIubyjPBr4A_3 I HAVE A LIGHT LIGHT ANCHOR THIS FACE IN THE THIS FACE IS TAKEN IT LITERALLY GUIDE THE PEG DOWN UNTIL IT USING THE OF THE LAYOUTS AND THE STANDS AND HITTING IT WITH SOME HOT GLUE GUN SO THAT IT WILL STAY
hIubyjPBr4A_4 AND THEN YOU COULD TAKE INCLUSIVE PUSH ON LAUGH AND HALF IT
hIubyjPBr4A_5 PLACE WHERE YOU LIKE IT TODAY
hIubyjPBr4A_6 THE NEXT THING I IS GIANTS WITH THAT'S A HOW CUTTING IT'S A VERY HEAVY FLOWER
hIubyjPBr4A_7 SECOND THAT SAME WIRE WHAT I'VE DONE IS UP CUT IT FACES OFF AND BEND IT AROUND SO THAT YOU HAVE A YOU'VE CLAMP AND TITLE AND THAT'S IT WORDS KNOCK AND BE SEEN BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE'VE COVERED THIS WITH A SILK FLOWERS I NEED TO FLIP THE HOLE IN THE FLOWERS WAS AN EXACTO KNIFE TO GET IT DOWN IN THERE
hIubyjPBr4A_8 AND AGAIN YOU COULD HIT WITH A HOT GLUE GUN TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY CAN STAY
hIubyjPBr4A_9 FROM OUT AND THE OTHER THING THAT WILL HELP YOU IS ON THIS FACES GOING ACROSS I'M GOING TO HAVE THE OF AND MOVE GOING DOWN INTO IT SO AGAIN USING A KNIFE EXACTO KNIFE CUTTING RIGHT INTO THE HOLE WITH THAT CUTTING LITTLE X INTO LEAF ON BOTH SIDES OF TOUGH TOUGH SO THEN WHEN YOU PUSH THIS DOWN TRUTH FLUFF FITNESS LEVEL
hIubyjPBr4A_10 THE CASE THAT THAT'S TO THIS AND WE CAN DO THE SAME THING BY TOUCHING THIS WITH A PIN FROM THAT THIS ONE TO THE SKIS SO WHEN YOU'RE STARTING OF HALF OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN HANG IT
hIubyjPBr4A_11 SO THE NEXT THING YOU NEED TO DO A STARTER ATTACKS IN YOUR PIECES TOGETHER ON A HORIZONTAL SURFACE THAT WILL BE HEAVIER OF CONSTRUCTION SO IT'S EASIER THAN TRYING TO DO IT WALLS HANGING ON A VERTICAL
hIubyjPBr4A_12 SO THAT'S OUR YOUR PIECES ADD BEFORE YOU HANG IT UP ON THE VERTICAL
gmlvsCma0hw_1 NOW IN THIS PART WILL LEARN HOW TO DO OUR SPIN OKAY

gmlvsCma0hw_14 FROM HERE JUMP HUGE HUGE WINS
gmlvsCma0hw_15 THERE WE GO AND OVERLAY FEET
gmlvsCma0hw_16 SO THEN JUMP USED IN
gmlvsCma0hw_18 AND THAT'S IN THE A JUMP SEVEN TWENTY SPIN
gmlvsCma0hw_19 SO THEY DO IT AND IN THIS STEP HERE STEP TOGETHER
gmlvsCma0hw_20 AND IT'S NOT ALL AND IT CAN IT SHIELD AND NOT IN A FIFTH OF THE TWO FOUR
gmlvsCma0hw_21 AND THEY GET A GOOD ANGLE JUMP AND JUMP TOE ON TWISTED TIGHTNESS THAT ONE TO BACK A WIG ALL INTO THE SALT LANDING

h4wXfn9IwSo_1 MY NAME IS ANTHONY METAL MONEY AND I'M TALKING ABOUT HOW TO BECOME A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER
h4wXfn9IwSo_2 I'M USING PHOTOGRAPHER IS PHOTOGRAPHER THAT REALLY WEARS A LOT OF HATS SO TO SPEAK
h4wXfn9IwSo_3 A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHERS HIM PHOTOGRAPH EXHIBITS GOING ON A MUSEUM MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER CAN ALSO TAKE IMAGES OF MUSEUMS COLLECTIONS
h4wXfn9IwSo_4 SO THAT IS ONE PART ABOUT BEING A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER THAT REQUIRES QUITE A BIT OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE AND HOW TO PHOTOGRAPH DOCUMENTS HAD A PHOTOGRAPH ARTWORK PAINTINGS YOU MIGHT HAVE BE PHOTOGRAPHING PHOTOGRAPHS
h4wXfn9IwSo_5 SO DOING THAT IS ACTUALLY PRETTY INTERESTING YOU'LL BE USING STROBE MONEY I'M USING DIGITAL SCANNERS ABUSING DIGITAL CAMERAS REVIEWS IT FROM CAMERAS
h4wXfn9IwSo_6 ALL THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TOOLS THAT ARE AT THE PHOTOGRAPHER IS PULL LOTS OF SPEAK WILL CREATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF IMAGES FOR MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER
h4wXfn9IwSo_7 IS ALSO QUITE A BIT OF COPYRIGHT THAT YOU HAVE TO NOW CAN I DO THIS
h4wXfn9IwSo_8 ONE REALLY INTERESTING TERM I HEARD OF USING A PHOTOGRAPHER ONCE SAID IS THAT I'M NOT IMPROVING UPON ARE MEANING THAT YOU ARE JUST PHOTOGRAPHING THE ARTWORK
h4wXfn9IwSo_9 YOU'RE NOT REALLY TRYING TO MAKE THAT PAINTING OR SCULPTURE ANY BETTER REDUCED DOCUMENTING IT
h4wXfn9IwSo_10 I WAS THAT THAT WAS REALLY AN INTERESTING WAY TO LOOK AT IT
h4wXfn9IwSo_11 ONE OTHER WAY TO LOOK AT IT TOO IS THAT PAINTINGS DON'T TALK BACK
h4wXfn9IwSo_12 I'M FIVE FOR THAT PHOTOGRAPHS A LOT OF PEOPLE THE KNEES TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PERSONALITIES ON PHOTOGRAPHING
h4wXfn9IwSo_13 WHEN I'M PHOTOGRAPHING PAINTING A PIECE OF ARTWORK AND STUDIO IT UP AND SAME THING BACK TO ME WHETHER THE POSITIVE ARE GOOD OR IT THEY DON'T HAVE A PICTURE TAKEN
h4wXfn9IwSo_14 THAT'S FUN A COOL AND SOME DAYS REDS ONE PHOTOGRAPHS SOMETHING AND NOT BE BOTHERED
h4wXfn9IwSo_15 SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE WAYS THAT YOU CAN BECOME A MUSEUM PHOTOGRAPHER AND GET OUT ALSO SPEND A DAY WITH A MUSEUM DIVERSE YOU IT'S LIKE
h4wXfn9IwSo_16 SEE IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN
h4wXfn9IwSo_17 AND I'VE KNOWN FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS THAT YOU CAN ARCHIVIST PROGRAMS RIT SEE EXACTLY WHAT I'M USING AND THUS
h4wXfn9IwSo_18 THAT IS SOME OF THE TIPS THAT I WOULD SAY TO SOME OF THE LAST BECOME A MUSEUM OF
gImBKT9w0Mk_1 HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
gImBKT9w0Mk_2 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN OUR CENTER GOES DOWN THE SNAP THE BALL THAT WE DON'T GET ANY PENALTIES
gImBKT9w0Mk_3 NOW ONE PENALTY OBVIOUSLY IS THE OFFSIDE PENALTY
gImBKT9w0Mk_4 A LOT OF TIMES THAT COME FROM A GUY THAT IS EITHER NOT LISTENING TO THE CADENCE IS NOT WATCHING THE BALL OR TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE BALL YOU MAKE THE MISTAKE ANY JUMPS OFF SIDES PREMATURELY
gImBKT9w0Mk_5 THERE CAN BE OFFSIDE CALLED AGAINST A CENTER FOR MOVING OR WILL BE CALLED MANIPULATING THE BALL TO THROW OFF OF THE FENCE
gImBKT9w0Mk_6 SO A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS WHEN HE GOES DOWN OF ALL THESE GOTTA GET SET
gImBKT9w0Mk_7 A LOT OF TIMES LEAD LET THE BALL THE BALL WILL BE LAYING ON THE GROUND IT MAY EVEN BE TURN TO THE SIDE
gImBKT9w0Mk_8 HE'S ALLOWED TO GRAB THAT BALL AND GO AHEAD AGAINST THAT WILL WANT TO GET THAT BALL SET THE KEY OF THE MOVEMENT
gImBKT9w0Mk_9 AGAIN THE CHILDREN IT BACK TO HIM BECAUSE IT'S GOT MAYBE THINK HE'S TRYING TO FIGHT THE SNAP
gImBKT9w0Mk_10 THE DEADLY CANNOT LIFT THE BALL UP AT ANY POINT TIME
gImBKT9w0Mk_11 IT CAN LIVE THEN OR MOVE AND OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT OR REPOSITION IT
gImBKT9w0Mk_12 THINGS ON THE BALL COMES UP WORDS MOVE IT THERE BRISTLES CANTED THAT CAN BE CALLED AS AN OFF SIDES
gImBKT9w0Mk_13 ONCE YOU GET THAT WALL LOCKED IN READY YOU GOTTA KEEP RIGHT THERE
gImBKT9w0Mk_14 YOU CAN BE MOVING OUT ALL AROUND
gImBKT9w0Mk_15 THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO THE COST YOUR TEAM FIVE YARDS
GrBZZfFbDog_1 ANY TIME THAT YOU ARE OUTSIDE UP PARTICULARLY IF YOU CAN BE SPENDING TIME OUTSIDE BY YOURSELF YOU WANNA BE SURE THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF OF ALLERGIES TO INSECT BITES OR STAINS THAT YOU ARE WELL PREPARED FOR IT
GrBZZfFbDog_2 IF YOU HAVE AND THAT ENOUGH FROM PAD AND BE SURE THAT YOU KEEP THAT OUT HANDY WITH YOU AND I'M ITEMS BE A GOOD IDEA IF IF YOU HAVE SERIOUS ALLERGIES TO THESE IN WASPS AND AND THAT'S FROM THING OF THAT YOU JUST CHECK IN WITH SOMEBODY BEFORE YOU GO STANDARD TIME OUTSIDE IN THEN THAT YOU CHECK BACK IN WITH THEM AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME
GrBZZfFbDog_3 AND NOT YOU THAT WE JUST SORT OF PUT SOMEBODY ON THE LOWER IF THEY HAVEN'T HEARD BACK FROM YOU
GrBZZfFbDog_4 YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN ACCIDENTS AREN'T ACCIDENTALS THINGS CAN HAPPEN OBVIOUSLY DON'T PLAN FOR ACCIDENTS
GrBZZfFbDog_5 SO IT'S A SERIOUS CONSIDERATION
GrBZZfFbDog_6 BE SURE TO KEEP HER UP AND A FRIEND YOUR BANNER DRILL WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU NEED I'M IN DID THAT UP USE IN AN EMERGENCY HANDY AND THAT WILL HELP YOU FEEL SAFE AND RELAX THE OUTSIDE
H3kuHP_DqR4_1 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE A SHOW HOW TO INSTALL WINDOW AND SELL

H3kuHP_DqR4_3 AND WE'RE GOING TO USE A TWENTY HUGE CLEAR OF OIL FOR THE WINDOW
H3kuHP_DqR4_4 SO I'M JUST AND MAKE A ROUGH CUT ON THE VINYL ON A BIGGER THAN OR WINDOW AND THE ANGLES TAKE THE WINDOW ON THE PANEL AND MAKE THE PROPER CATS THINGS SIZE IT PROPERLY
H3kuHP_DqR4_5 ONE THING TO REMEMBER IS OFF ALWAYS I CUT THE HANDLE FOR FORTY STICK THE WINDOW ON

H3kuHP_DqR4_7 SO FOR THE WINDOW WE'VE ALREADY DRAWN THE WINDOW PERIMETER OF AN NON MIDDLEWEIGHT ON STICKY TEA ALONG WINDOW PERIMETER
H3kuHP_DqR4_8 THE KEY GOOD TAPING IT IS TO LET THE TREAT RELAXES IT HITS THE CLAW
H3kuHP_DqR4_9 SO WE HAVE A TAPE
H3kuHP_DqR4_10 LEFT HEEL ONE END SHIN STICK THE VINYL ON THEM
H3kuHP_DqR4_11 AND ONE OF HOW VINYL AND NOT WHOLE LONG TAPE BECAUSE THE VINYL STRETCH AND THEN SHRINK IS IT HITS THE CLOTH AND YOU'LL END UP WITH A WRINKLY WINDOW
H3kuHP_DqR4_12 A FEW TRIM CLOCKWISE AROUND YOU HIT THE SCISSOR EDGE RIGHT NEXT TO THE TEE
H3kuHP_DqR4_13 ON THE CLOTH SIDE GETTING THE SCISSORS RIGHT NEXT TO THE TAPE WILL HELP PREVENT FOR <UNK>
H3kuHP_DqR4_14 AFTER CUTTING A VINYL OFF ON WHO CAN FLIP THE PEDAL OVER AND CUT OUT THE CLOTH ON THE BACKSIDE
H3kuHP_DqR4_15 NOW WE'VE ALREADY NUMEROUS LETTING THE CLOTH
H3kuHP_DqR4_16 IN THE OTHER IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU HAVEN'T NATIVE SLIT IN OR IF YOU SELL IT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET TO SELL CLOTH OUT COCOA WILL MOVE ON TO
H3kuHP_DqR4_17 SO DON'T FOR YOU TO REDUCE LIT <UNK>
H3kuHP_DqR4_18 IF A HIGH F SO THERE WE HAVE A FINISHED WHEN I'M SELL
H3kuHP_DqR4_19 WE'LL GO AHEAD AND TAKE THIS MACHINE AND SEW BOTH EDGES THAT FIRMER
H3kuHP_DqR4_20 SO TWO ROWS OF SEWING AWARE ON THE WINDOW

hgGySE80h88_1 NOW ONE OF THE THING THAT IS ONE OF THE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OHM WHEN WE'RE TALKING JUST IN IN GENERAL WHILE COLLECTING AND WE'RE TALKING RIGHT NOW SPECIFICALLY ABOUT COLLECTING BECAUSE
hgGySE80h88_2 ON A LOT OF THESE THESE THINGS ON THE AND BECOME POPULAR FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS AND I CAN GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES
hgGySE80h88_3 I MEAN EVERYONE ELSE MARTHA STEWART ON MARTHA STEWART WHEN SHE ON HAT OR SHOSH AND GO ONE AND SHE WILL SHOW YOU SOME OF THE THINGS THAT SHE LIKES A LOT BETTER IN TEA
hgGySE80h88_4 ONE OF THE THINGS IN PARTICULAR COMES TO MIND WITH ME IS YELLOW WHERE ANSCHEL DISPLAYED IN BACK OF FOR WHEN SHE'S TALKING ON ARE SHOWING DOING IN COOKING
hgGySE80h88_5 IN THIS A LOT YELLOW WHERE IT BECOMES FAMILIAR TO PEOPLE OF PEOPLE WANT A COLLECTING ON THE MARKET STEWART COLLECTS IT THEN IT MUST BE GOOD
hgGySE80h88_6 SO ANOTHER THING THAT COMES TO MINE IS ON ON FIRE KING WHICH IS A NEW MEAN ON DINNER WE'RE ON PRODUCED IN THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS HOME THAT OFF OF LIFE A SUIT SHELVES ALL THE TIME
hgGySE80h88_7 WHEN YOU CAN SEE SHOOT SHE ACTUALLY REPRODUCE THIS FIRE KING IN ON BECAME VERY POPULAR SO IT WILL RAISE THAT THE PRICE ON THESE ITEMS WHEN WHEN ON THEY BECOME MORE AND THE MAIN

gq16AjL_UlQ_13 NOW THIS IS WHERE THE DENOUEMENT AS THEY SAY LITERATURE HAPPENS
gq16AjL_UlQ_14 YOU'RE GOING TO BE AT A POINT WHERE BOTH OF YOU ARE GOING TO BE EVALUATING THE DIRECTION
gq16AjL_UlQ_15 THE THIRD DATE IS THE KEY TO THE FUTURE THE GERMAN A HAND WITH THIS PERSON
gq16AjL_UlQ_16 AND FOR SOME REASON WE HAVE THIS MAGIC NUMBER MINE
gq16AjL_UlQ_17 WHICH IS A THREE
gq16AjL_UlQ_18 AND THEY ARE IN LIES THE CHALLENGE
gq16AjL_UlQ_19 EITHER A AS I HAD A WOMAN CALL RECENTLY SAYING
gq16AjL_UlQ_20 YOU KNOW THE MAN JUST DIDN'T HAVE THIS STRING THAT I WANT IT
gq16AjL_UlQ_22 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
gq16AjL_UlQ_23 AND THAT CERTAIN BUT THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID
gq16AjL_UlQ_24 OR BEAT SHE JUST DIDN'T HAVE BEEN DEPTH THAT I WANT IT
gq16AjL_UlQ_25 MAYBE SHOES TO SHALLOW FOR HIM
gq16AjL_UlQ_26 BUT THE ASKED WHERE WE START MAKING OUR JUDGEMENTS
gq16AjL_UlQ_27 AND I SAY DON'T MAKE MORE JUDGEMENTS FOR ANYONE
gq16AjL_UlQ_28 BUT THIS IS A POINT WHERE WE FEEL THAT WORK COMFORTABLE WITH THIS PERSON
gq16AjL_UlQ_29 OR WE'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THIS PERSON
gq16AjL_UlQ_30 IF THAT THIRD DATE AND DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A SLAM BANG FAIR
gq16AjL_UlQ_31 IT CAN BE A VERY SIMPLE FAIR
gq16AjL_UlQ_32 IT CAN BE SOMETHING WE ARE TALKING NOW
gq16AjL_UlQ_33 AND KIND OF SAYING OKAY
gq16AjL_UlQ_34 I THINK WE CAN GO BEYOND THIS POINT
gq16AjL_UlQ_35 I THAT THEY'RE DAYS A CHARM
gq16AjL_UlQ_36 MAY YOUR FANTASIES OF TODAY BE YOUR REALITIES OF TOMORROW
guv2h74Gpyk_1 I AM JEFF OF TWO WHEELER DEALER
guv2h74Gpyk_2 TO THEM A SHADY HAD A CHANGE A FLAT TIRE
guv2h74Gpyk_3 SO ABOUT ONE TOOL THAT YOU NEED TO CHANGE A FLAT TIRE
guv2h74Gpyk_4 NOT JUST THE TIRE LEVER
guv2h74Gpyk_5 AND YOU NEED AT LEAST ONE UP TO ABOUT THREE
guv2h74Gpyk_6 DEPENDING ON HOW TIGHTLY TIGHT TIRE IS
guv2h74Gpyk_7 USUALLY NEW A RIDGE EVEN JUST JUST ONE
guv2h74Gpyk_8 NOW FIRST THING IS YOU WANT IT START OPPOSITE VALVE STEM
guv2h74Gpyk_9 INSERT THE TIRE LEVER UNDER ONE HALF OF THE TIRE V
guv2h74Gpyk_10 AND SHOULD THEN BE ABLE TO TO SLIP RIGHT OFF
guv2h74Gpyk_11 CANON LENS IF THE OLLIE <UNK> FLUFF THINNING BACK OFFICES THE VALVE STEM
guv2h74Gpyk_12 AT THAT POINT SHOULD DEALER REACH INSIDE THAT TIRE AND REMOVE THE FLAT INNER TUBE
guv2h74Gpyk_13 AND I'M FROM LINEN REVENUE INNER TUBE OR EITHER TRY AND CATCH THE FLAT ONE ON
guv2h74Gpyk_14 BUT THE NEXT STEP TO REINSTALLING IS IN A BEATS TWO AND INFLATE THE TUBE WITH A LITTLE BIT AIR JUST TO GIVE IT SOME SHAPE
guv2h74Gpyk_15 AND THEN YOU'LL START OPPOSITE OF ENTERED AS AS REMOVAL
guv2h74Gpyk_16 AND INSERT INSERT THE STAND IS A HOLE IN THE ROOM
guv2h74Gpyk_17 IF IT AND THEN TUCK THAT TIRE THE INNER TUBE OF INTO THE TIRE ALL THE WAY AROUND IF
guv2h74Gpyk_18 A THIN STARTING AT THE VALVE COMPLETING FLIEGEL REINSTALL THE OTHER HALF OF THE TIRE BEAD
guv2h74Gpyk_19 BEING CAREFUL NOT TO CHANGE THE INNER TUBE BETWEEN THE TIRE IN THE ONLY IMAGES WE'RE IF SHE WERE FOR THE BACK ON
guv2h74Gpyk_20 AND YOU WANT TO END UP THE OPPOSITE THAT VALVES THEM SO THAT YOU HAVE THE MOST SLACK IT'S HIGHER FLAHIVE FILE LAST LITTLE BIT BACK ON
guv2h74Gpyk_21 THE TRICK IS NOT TO USE ANY TOOLS AND TRY TO FLAT IT ON
guv2h74Gpyk_22 OTHERWISE YOU RUN HIGHER RISK OF PINCHING INTO
guv2h74Gpyk_23 ON SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT JUST BY WORKING ON SLOWLY
guv2h74Gpyk_24 IF YOU HAVE IT
guv2h74Gpyk_25 YOU CAN AND THEN JUST INFLATED TO ON YOU RECOMMENDED INFLATION PRESSURE
guv2h74Gpyk_26 WHICH SHOULD BE MARKS ON THE OUTSIDE OF ON PRETTY MUCH ALL TIRES
guv2h74Gpyk_27 AND <UNK>
HB01hhonf8Q_1 BEHIND THE BACK GRABS IN FRONT OF THE BODY GRABS NOW GOING TO MOVE INTO THE FINAL SECTION OF THE YELDELL TEST WITCHES STRIPES
HB01hhonf8Q_2 THE FIRST TRY TO MOVE NET SKI
HB01hhonf8Q_3 AND WHEN IT AGAIN IS MID LEVEL SKI BEING STRIKE
HB01hhonf8Q_4 SO WHEN IT'S THE COATED DASH IS THE TECHNIQUE
HB01hhonf8Q_5 AS HE GOES INTO STRIVE HE HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT HE PUNCHES ME IN THE STOMACH
HB01hhonf8Q_6 ONE MIGHT WORSE CUT PIECES WHEN PEOPLE PUNCH OUT HERE
HB01hhonf8Q_7 OFF
HB01hhonf8Q_8 I DON'T CARE TREATMENTS THAT HERE BECAUSE THAT ALL DAY LONG OLLIES DOING IS FANNING ME
HB01hhonf8Q_9 IS MAKING A COOL OFF
HB01hhonf8Q_10 SO HE AT THE PUNCH LIKE HE'S GOING TO MAKE YOU SEE MY LUNCH
HB01hhonf8Q_11 AS IT DOES THAT IF I DO MY CAN CON MOTION OF WE TALK ABOUT THE VERY BEGINNING THIS TURNING MOTION
HB01hhonf8Q_12 SO WITH THE STRIKES I CAN CALL IN CONTROL THIS WRIST AND BRING IT BACK AROUND
HB01hhonf8Q_13 PRINCIPAL A DYNAMIC REVERSAL
HB01hhonf8Q_14 THE BAGS BOUGHT FROM SOMEONE RIGHT AROUND AND THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE GIVING HIM MOMENTUM TO STRIKE THE WITH
HB01hhonf8Q_15 IF YOU WANT TO THE OTHER HAND IF YOU GET REALLY CLEAN YOUR CLOCK FROM HERE
HB01hhonf8Q_16 SO YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL THIS WRIST FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
HB01hhonf8Q_18 IF FROM HERE IF COATED ASHY LIKE A TALK WITH OR IS NOT A WRIST LOCK OUT TO THE SIDE LIKE THIS
HB01hhonf8Q_19 A LOT OF SIDE LIKE YOU KNOW YOU'LL SEE A BIG HUGE WRIST LOCK IT WHICH IS A REALLY PRETTY FALTERING PRESS ON CAMERA
HB01hhonf8Q_20 BUT IN REALITY GETTING A LOT OF UPPER TREATED PUNCH FOR DOES NOT MY HANDS OFF AND PUT ME INCLUDING ISSUE MYSELF
HB01hhonf8Q_21 SO INSTEAD WE KEEP OUR CUTTING IT IS VERY SMALL IF BENEFIT FROM THE NEXT ONE I CONTROL THE ENTIRE BODY WITH THIS HOCK OF HAVE HOOF <UNK>
HB01hhonf8Q_22 YOU'LL ALSO SEE I MOVE RIGHT INTO THE PEN THAT I DISCUSSED BEFORE
HB01hhonf8Q_23 EXTENDING THE SHOULDER INTO THE GROUND MAINTAINING CONTROLLED ABOUT MY ENTIRE WORKSPACE LAID OUT WILL FORM
HB01hhonf8Q_24 I GET YOU THE TECHNIQUE IN THE OUTSIDE AND THESE ARE FOR MOVE AWAY THESE TWO IF IT'S TOO EASY FOR ME TO LOSE THAT
HB01hhonf8Q_25 SO FROM HERE I'VE GOTTEN CAN'T HEAR AND THE STARTS TO GET AWAY I CAN TRANSITIONED IN THE STRIKE THROUGH A HAT GROUND TO A KNEE DROP IF ANYTHING THAT I NEED IS RIGHT HERE MY FEET
HB01hhonf8Q_26 CONTROL ARM IF STEP AWAY
hErdpsfFwec_1 HI MY NAME'S DAMP CLOTH AND I'M WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
hErdpsfFwec_2 NOW TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO TAKE THESE EXAMPLE BALLOONS AND COMBINING TOGETHER DEGREE COMPLEX FILLING
hErdpsfFwec_3 IN OUR PREVIOUS SEGMENT WE ARE TO COMBINE A HEART WITH THE TEDDY BEAR
hErdpsfFwec_4 WE'RE NOT ADD COMBINE A SMALL FLOWER AND A BASIC HAPPEN WITH THE HEART AND THE TEDDY BEAR AND PUT THOSE ALL TOGETHER
hErdpsfFwec_5 STARTING WITH A SMALL FLOWER MEN INFLATABLE IN <UNK> LEAVING QUITE A BIT ON INFLATED SO AS I TWIST THE BALLOON MY BUBBLES AND PUTTING THE AIR AND THE EMPTY PART OF THE BALLOON FIVE OF LID OFF TO DO AN APPLE TYPE BY STICKY MY FINGER INSIDE THE BLUE AND GRABBING HOLD OF THE FOOT UP PART I PUT IN THERE
hErdpsfFwec_6 HOLD MY FINGER OUT AND THEN TWIST UP THREE MAIN OR THE BOW LIVED IN THE APPLE CLASHES DAY LIKE THIS
hErdpsfFwec_7 AND THE CONTINUE WANT BY DOING TO FRY SLEEVES LINE AND FALL BOWLS
hErdpsfFwec_8 ALWAYS HOLDING ON TO THE END OF THE BALLOON SO DOESN'T COME APART
hErdpsfFwec_9 AND THEN THICK THOSE TWO TOGETHER FOLDER NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND TWIST FEATHER REPEAT THAT STUFF TO MORE TIME
hErdpsfFwec_10 THERE IS YOUR BASIC FLOWER
hErdpsfFwec_11 I'M COMBINED THAT BY PUTTING THE FLOWER FIFTH INSIDE THE FAT EVENT FLUFF THIN OUT AT A HEART WITH THE TEDDY BEAR HOLDING A SMALL FLOWER
HgfNeFjfdJY_1 AS OF A CHALK AND DO A LOT HELMETS FOR SNOWBOARDING
HgfNeFjfdJY_2 I'M WHEN DON'T SNOWBOARDING YOU DEFINITELY WANT ONLY USE A SKI AND SNOWBOARD HOW MEANT OF BY KALMAN OR A FOOTBALL HELMET OR LACROSSE HOLMAN NONE OF THOSE ARE GOING TO WORK ON
HgfNeFjfdJY_3 THESE HELMETS AMA SPECIFICALLY TO BE HELD UP IN THE GOLD CONDITIONS
HgfNeFjfdJY_4 I'M THE COME INSULATED
HgfNeFjfdJY_5 THEY HAVE A LOT OF ADJUSTABLE SETTINGS ON THEM AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY HAVE COVERING IS OVER THE EARS ARE ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE WARMERS
HgfNeFjfdJY_6 NOW THE EVEN MAKE INTEGRATED HELMETS THAT HAVE HEADPHONES IN THE EAR FLAPS BUT AGAIN YOU DO NOT ONLY USE ANYTHING ELSE HAS EITHER THE SKIING OR SNOWBOARDING ALMOND BECAUSE A BIKE HELMET YES IT CAN TAKE THE IMPACT IN AN WARMER TEMPERATURES AND IF YOU WERE TO BRING A BIKE HELMET OR SOMETHING ELSE TO THEM AROUND WITH IT JUST THE COLDS PRETTY MUCH CAN CRACK IT LIKE AN EGG SHELLS SOON AS YOU ARE TO HIT ANYTHING
HgfNeFjfdJY_7 SO AGAIN JUST USE A SKIERS IN A WORD HOME
GJTeGXfpmUw_1 NOW IN AND DO IS DRAW THE EYES BUT WHAT WE CAN DRAW A AS WE NEED TO DRAW A LINE THROUGH THE CENTER IN IS A CURVE LAB AND IT IS GOING AROUND THE CURVE OBJECT
GJTeGXfpmUw_2 THIS IS GOING TO THESE THE CENTER OF THE I'VE ONLY LEFT THAT
GJTeGXfpmUw_3 NOW THE WAY THE ITEM WORKS IT SORT OF WAS SHADE WITH INTO THE AS CAN BE LOW AS OUR OTHER WASN'T GRAVITY WOULDN'T WORK ON IT PROPERLY LOSES THE SHAPE OF AND I'VE INVERT CRUDE SCENTS
GJTeGXfpmUw_4 THE OTHER EVER GOING TO BE A MIRROR IMAGE OF IT BUT SINCE IT'S FOR SHORT AND IT'S NOT UNIQUE ONE IS LONG
GJTeGXfpmUw_5 IT INTO THE IN WE COME AROUND THERE LIKE THIS
GJTeGXfpmUw_6 YOU'LL BE RACING THESE WITH LANDS LATER OR
GcIfvcCPE4U_1 ON RUN TALK ABOUT CANCER
GcIfvcCPE4U_2 CANCER PISCES ARE OR A MOUSE THAT THEY'RE NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME BUT THEY THEY CARRY A LOT OF THE SAME CHARACTERISTIC ZOOM IN RELATIONSHIPS
GcIfvcCPE4U_3 CANCER CANCER PEOPLE TO A I'M CAN ARE COMPATIBLE WITH ALL THEIR SIGNS
GcIfvcCPE4U_4 THERE'S SOME SIGNS THAT SAY A ON AN LEO WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TOLERATE THE MOOD ENOS OF THE OTHER CANCER FOR TOO LONG OR
GcIfvcCPE4U_5 CANCERS IF IF THEY FEEL REJECTION OR IF THEY FEEL HURT WILL LOCK THEMSELVES AWAY INSIDE THE HOUSE FOR QUITE SOME TIME BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE COMPARABLE
GcIfvcCPE4U_6 THINK ABOUT THE SHELL ON THE BACK OF THE CRAB
GcIfvcCPE4U_7 THAT DRIES A LEO PERSON CRAZY BECAUSE LEOS ARE JUST AN OUT THERE
GcIfvcCPE4U_8 THEY'RE THEY'RE GREGARIOUS
GcIfvcCPE4U_9 THEY'RE THE
GcIfvcCPE4U_10 THEY'RE THE SAW THE PROBLEM
GcIfvcCPE4U_11 THEY DON'T LINGER IN THE PAST
GcIfvcCPE4U_12 THEY A I EVEN THOUGH THERE'S THERE'S SOME SENSE OF INSECURITIES THEY DON'T RELY OR IN THEIR INSECURITIES
GcIfvcCPE4U_13 THEY THEY USE YOU DON'T LIKE IT A THEY DON'T LIKE FOR PEOPLE TO AFFECT THEM AND SEWED THERE
GcIfvcCPE4U_14 THEY THEY CHANGE THAT WITH THEIR THEIR LEADERSHIP SKILLS IN WITH THEIR THEIR BASIC <UNK> REALITY
GcIfvcCPE4U_15 UH SO I CANCER AND A LEO THAT CAN WORK WELL BECAUSE OF IF IF THE LEO PERSON BECOMES MORE COMPASSIONATE TOWARDS THE CANCER AND LEARNS TO PROTECT THOSE TRAITS WITHIN THE CANCER AND KNOWS THAT OF THERE WILL BE A WITHDRAWAL
GcIfvcCPE4U_16 IF SAY THEY'RE OUT TOGETHER AND SOMEONE INSULTS THE THE CANCER MATE THAT THIS CANCER MATES ASTRONOMY TREATMENTS THAT
GcIfvcCPE4U_17 AND SO JUST THAT'S BE EXCEPT IT SO IT THE LEO CAN ACCEPT THAT PART ABOUT THE CANCER THAT IT'S FOR IT
GcIfvcCPE4U_18 CANCERS ARE VERY SENSITIVE LEVERS
GcIfvcCPE4U_19 THEY LOVE THE HOME
GcIfvcCPE4U_20 THAT WILL HAVE THE THE COVERS THAT ARE SOFT AND AN OF THAT FEEL NICE LIKE OF A LOWER OR IT YOU KNOW THAT THAT NIGHTS FABRIC
GcIfvcCPE4U_21 THE THE HAVE THE FLUFFY PILLOWS AROUND THEIR FAVORITE PILLOW
GcIfvcCPE4U_22 THE HOME AND BEDROOMS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM
GcIfvcCPE4U_23 AND IT'S OF VERY COZY WORM ENVIRONMENT
GcIfvcCPE4U_24 THEY ARE THEY'RE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE SO THERE'S SENSITIVE TOWARDS ANOTHER TO THERE ARE COMPANIONS EMOTIONS AND TO THEIR NEEDS
GcIfvcCPE4U_25 SO IN THE CANCER WOULD GET ALONG WITH THE LAYER BECAUSE THE CANCER WILL TAKE YOU KNOW THEY'RE VERY CARING PEOPLE IN THE CANCER WILL TAKE CARE LAYER
GcIfvcCPE4U_26 BUT IT'S IS HAVE A LEO WOULD FEEL THAT THE CANCER
GcIfvcCPE4U_27 SO IN ACTUALITY THE LEO JUST NEEDS TO LOOK AT THESE CHARACTERISTICS AND SAY OKAY I NEED TO ACCEPT THAT THAT YOU KNOW I CAN CHANGE THAT IN THE CANCER PERSON
GcIfvcCPE4U_28 AND AS ALLOW THE CANCER TO DO WHAT COMES NATURALLY
GcIfvcCPE4U_29 I'M TO ONE TO STAY AT HOME OR TO MAKE THE HOLE IN THE HOME A HOME BASE IN EVERYTHING COMES AROUND FROM OF THE HOME
GcIfvcCPE4U_30 LET UP A HOME IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE A THE CANCER AND SO
GcIfvcCPE4U_31 THERE AND BURN LOVEMAKING TENDS TO SHOW THE OTHER PERSON LOT MORE CONSIDERATION A LOT MORE CARRYING A LOT MORE COMPASSION A LOT MORE NURTURING
GcIfvcCPE4U_32 SINCE THEY'RE SO SENSITIVE THEY USE ALL THEIR SENSES AND I'M IN OF THE TONGUE THE HANDS THE EVERYTHING THEY THEY THEY USE ALL ALL FIVE SENSES IN LOVEMAKING
GcIfvcCPE4U_33 THEY TEND TO GO LONGER BECAUSE THAT IS BUSSIE IF THEY'RE IN A NICE WARM ENVIRONMENT
GcIfvcCPE4U_34 SO YOU HAVE IF YOU HAVE A CANCER LOVER OF A SUGGEST YOU IN ABOUT MAKING A NIGHTS HOME ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE IT CANCER WILL TEND TO STICK AROUND AN OUT USUALLY HAVE MORE LOVEMAKING BAG
GcIfvcCPE4U_35 DON'T EXPECT THE CANCER TO MAKE GLOVE ON ON OF ROOFTOP YOU KNOW WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN WATCH RESISTANCE WOULD NOT BE WITHIN A CANTONS MAJOR
GcIfvcCPE4U_36 HOWEVER BE WITHIN THE LEOS NATURE
GRBkx6X7G4Q_1 A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER WHEN YOU'RE PLANTING OUR ORNAMENTS IS THAT THEY DO GET DIRTY
GRBkx6X7G4Q_2 THEY HAND A TREE FOR TWO MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR THEY GET DUSTY
GRBkx6X7G4Q_3 IT CAN BE VERY CAREFUL ON HIGH CLAY KNEES
GRBkx6X7G4Q_4 ON ORNAMENTS LIKE THIS THAT ARE THE CHARACTERS I USUALLY TAKE A BOWL OF SOAPY WATER AND ONE OF CLEAR
GRBkx6X7G4Q_5 GET THAT YOU TIP PEN CLEAN THE AREAS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO THE DUST
GRBkx6X7G4Q_6 TOGETHER INTO THE TO TIP IT RUNS WATER AND RINSE IT OFF AND SET IT SOME PLACE TO DRY
GRBkx6X7G4Q_7 BE SURE THAT IT'S TOTALLY DRY BEFORE YOU PACK THAT UP THEM UP FOR THE SEASON
GRBkx6X7G4Q_8 I ORNAMENTS LIKE THE ACRYLIC YET REMEMBER YOU TOUCH THEM IN AT LEAST FINGERPRINTS WHICH MAKES THEM DIRTY
GRBkx6X7G4Q_9 FOR THESE AND TO DELIVER THE WINDEX IT UP AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE TOTALLY DRY OF IN A WINDEX IS BEEN REMOVED FOUR PACK THEM OUT
GRBkx6X7G4Q_10 THE ONE THING YOU DO WANT REMEMBER WHEN YOU'RE COLLECTING OLDER ORNAMENTS ANY HAVE A GLASS BALLS FOR DO NOT WASH THEM WITH ANYTHING
GRBkx6X7G4Q_11 THE OLDER ONES LIKE THIS THEY'RE PAINTED ON AND IT'LL SMEAR THE PAINT IN YOUR ORNAMENT WILL BE RUINED
GRBkx6X7G4Q_12 SO THESE GET DIRTY DRY BRUSH THEM OFF WITH A DRY CLOTH
gwNcGWh4dQA_1 I AM HANTA EYE
gwNcGWh4dQA_2 GO INTO A GET HIM INTO THE WOOD
gwNcGWh4dQA_3 AND USUALLY THE BAND
gwNcGWh4dQA_4 I VISUAL ROUGE A
gwNcGWh4dQA_5 SO GO THROUGH THROUGH THROW THE OTHER THINGS
gwNcGWh4dQA_6 DIFFERENT POSITIONS LIFT THAT THAT AND THAT THAT HITTING A METHOD OF THE THUMB AND THE F AND THE DRY THING THEY THE THAT HAS THEM ALL AN
gwNcGWh4dQA_7 WHEN YOU THAT ROW HIT <UNK> TO THAT AND HEALTHY
gwNcGWh4dQA_8 INTO IF IN AT THE END OF THE THINGS IN HALF AND THEN IT HAS THAT ARE THE ONES THAT <UNK>
gwNcGWh4dQA_9 THEN ON THE HANDLE LATH <UNK>
gwNcGWh4dQA_10 HAVE A FULL LENGTH VADNAIS TEETH THAT HAS A MONTH AND THEN THEY THINK THAT THAT HEAT LIVES CHANGED
hFHolYcaJew_1 MY NAME'S OWEN ROTH AND IN THIS CLIP WE'LL TALK ABOUT HOW TO CHOOSE A GOOD OUTDOOR LOCATION FOR VIDEO INTERVIEW
hFHolYcaJew_2 OKAY SO THE DIFFUSING JOIN US THINK ABOUT WHEN CHOOSING A LOCATION FOR ANOTHER INTERVIEW
hFHolYcaJew_3 ONE IS OF THE SUN AND THE WEATHER OF BECAUSE IN BAD WEATHER OBVIOUSLY RINGS CAN BE TOUGH YOU NEED IN OF SOME OF OVERHAND PROTECTION
hFHolYcaJew_4 OF BUT ALSO WHAT TYPE OF WHETHER YOU DON'T BE EXPECTING WITH ITS CLOUDY OR HARSH CLEARS GUYS LIKE THIS WITH HARSH ON MY UGLY THAT'LL DICTATE HOW WOULD YOU IN A NEW TO BRING OUT WHETHER MIGHT BE AN UMBRELLA OR REFLECTORS OR THINGS LIKE THAT
hFHolYcaJew_5 SO LIGHTING IS ONE THING UP AND THAT WILL ALSO MY DICTATE WARY AND PUT YOUR INTERVIEW
hFHolYcaJew_6 THE OF YOU ALWAYS WANT SOME BEHIND YOU IF IT'S A HARSH LIGHT LIKE NOW
hFHolYcaJew_7 SO WITH AN YOU DON'T WANT THINK OF WHAT KIND OF BE BEHIND THE INTERVIEW WE UP BASED ON WHERE THAT SOME IDENTITY
hFHolYcaJew_8 SO FOR ME I WOULD PLACE CONTINUALLY RIGHT HERE IN THE CHAIR OUT JUST BE OF <UNK> IN FRONT OF THEM INTERVIEWING THEM
hFHolYcaJew_9 SO THE BACKGROUND WOULD BE THIS AND THAT THAT'LL CREATE A NICE BACKGROUND OF LOTS OF VEGETATION NOTHING UGLY SO THAT SHOULD BE NICE AND SOME BEHIND ME
hFHolYcaJew_10 SO THAT'S HOW I WOULD SET THAT ABC'S YOU WANNA THINK OF WAS BEHIND THE SUBJECT AND HOW COMFORTABLE THERE AND BE SITTING IN THE DIRECTION LIKE THAT IN MIND WHEN A TOP FOR TWENTY MINUTES IF IT IS SITTING UNBEARABLE HEAT
hFHolYcaJew_11 SO YOU ON IT IN A KEY THESE THINGS IN IN MIND WHEN PICKING SPOT
hFHolYcaJew_12 ANOTHER THING HONESTLY IS ON
hFHolYcaJew_13 NOISE OFF OF WITH DIGNITY LIKE
hFHolYcaJew_14 OTHER IN WAS IN A BREWS
hFHolYcaJew_15 AND WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD
hFHolYcaJew_16 OTHER PLANES FLYING OVERHEAD
hFHolYcaJew_17 AND YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT SCOUT LOCATION BEFORE YOU OF CHOOSE IT
hFHolYcaJew_18 AND SCOUT AT THE TIME THAT YOU'RE IN A SCHEDULE THE INTERVIEW FOR NOT A DIFFERENT AND NOT IN THE MORNING AND NIGHT IT A DIFFERENT TIME AS YOU WANNA BE THERE AT THE TIME WHEN YOU'RE SCANNING WOULD BE THERE AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE ACTUALLY A HEAVY OF YOU SO YOU KNOW WHAT DID WAS IS OF ONE WAS IS CAN AND WILL OCCUR THEIR CLOTHES AND WAS LOCATION IS NO GOOD
hFHolYcaJew_19 IN THAT THAT MIGHT ALSO DICTATE WHAT TYPE OF AUDIO YOU CHOOSE TO DO WHETHER IT'S OF SHOTGUN OR LAPEL
hFHolYcaJew_20 SO THERE'S MANY FACTORS THAT UPCOMING CHOOSING GOOD OUTDOOR LOCATION
hFHolYcaJew_21 OF LIKE I SAID THIS ONE IS IDEAL FOR ME CONSIDER QUITE NEIGHBORHOOD OF OF GOT THE SHADE OF THE SOME REALLY IF I NEED IT AND I CAN PUT THAT OVER AND CANNA RIGHT HERE WITH THE LESS BACKGROUND
hFHolYcaJew_22 SO THIS IS A GOOD LOCATION OF FOR WHAT I WANT BUT IN A DIFFERENT FOR YOU
GYw0bMkyoQo_1 SO THE NEXT EXERCISE WILL BE THE SEATED CABLE ROW
GYw0bMkyoQo_2 THIS IS THE WORK YOUR BACK AND PLEASE FOLLOW THE BENCH PRESS WITH THIS SEATED PLAYABLE ROW
GYw0bMkyoQo_3 APPROACH THE MACHINE AND HAVE SEE
GYw0bMkyoQo_4 WE'RE IN SAKE AND OUR GRIP OR CLOSE GRIP TO START OFF WITH
GYw0bMkyoQo_5 GRIP THE HANDLE SLIDE BACK SO THAT YOUR LEGS ARE JUST ABOUT STRAIGHT WITH A SLIGHT BEND IN IN MEANS
GYw0bMkyoQo_6 WE DON'T BE PULLING YOUR HANDS DOWN TOWARD YOUR NAVEL JUST ABOVE YOUR BELLY BUTTON
GYw0bMkyoQo_7 KEEP THE ELBOWS TIGHTENS YOUR BODY AS YOU PULL BACK AND ROLL YOUR SHOULDERS ONTO YOUR BACK EACH TIME YOU CAN BE A REPETITION
GYw0bMkyoQo_8 BE SURE TO PRESS INTO YOUR FEET EACH AND EVERY TIME FOR SUPPORT AND PULL YOUR BELLY BUTTON IN TOWARDS RESPOND

GYw0bMkyoQo_12 LET THE ARMS AND SHOULDERS TO THE MOTION
GYw0bMkyoQo_13 PUSH WITH YOUR LEGS AGAIN HOLD THE BELLY BUTTON IN TIGHTEN UP YOUR ABDOMINALS AND PULL YOUR HANDS INTO YOUR STONE ELBOWS CLOSE BY OR SAW SHRUG YOU SHOULDERS ON YOUR BACK
GYw0bMkyoQo_14 GO FOR
giOX89zrQMc_1 A ROUNDED AND THUS IN A IS A POSE THE FOUR LIMBS STAFF POSE
giOX89zrQMc_2 AS A POSE THAT IS OFTEN TIMES DONE IN CORRECTLY BECAUSE OF IN PROPER ALIGNMENT WHICH CAN REALLY BOTHER YOUR SHOULDERS
giOX89zrQMc_3 SO ON WHEN YOU CAN USE A STRAP IT CAN REALLY PUT YOU IN THE PERFECT ALIGNMENT AND I RECOMMEND ANY BY YOU MAY HAVE PERFECT ARE TIGHT AROUND THE DONE DOESN'T MAYBE TO TRY IT THIS WAY JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN THE PROPER ALIGNMENT
giOX89zrQMc_4 SO YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE THE STRAP INTO A LITTLE CIRCLE THAT JUST FITS RIGHT ABOVE YOUR ELBOWS
giOX89zrQMc_5 SO WE'VE ALREADY MADE THIS FOR FACES SHE'S GONNA COME AND PUT THIS ON RIGHT ABOVE HER ELBOWS
giOX89zrQMc_7 AND SHE'S CAN HOLD IT TIGHT JUST LIKE THAT
giOX89zrQMc_8 SHE'S GONNA COME FORWARD IN PLACE OR HANDS DOWN RIGHT UNDER HER SHOULDERS
giOX89zrQMc_10 AND THEN SHE'S CAN EXTEND HER LEGS BACK AND COME UP INTO PLANK POSE
giOX89zrQMc_11 SHE'S GONNA LIFT WAY UP ON HER TOES AND BRING HER WEIGHT FORWARD CROWN OF THE HEAD FORWARD AND THEN BRING THIS STRAP RIGHT UNDERNEATH AND RIGHT ALONG THE BROW LINE
giOX89zrQMc_13 AND JUST A SKULL L.A AND THAT LIKE HAVING A
giOX89zrQMc_14 NOW YOU NEED TO NOTICE THAT HER RESTS AN ELBOW ARE IN ALIGNMENT
giOX89zrQMc_15 SO YOU HAVE TO BRING THE ELBOW FORWARD AND WHAT MOST PEOPLE DO A SHOOT THEIR ELBOWS BACK SO THEIR WRISTS ARE WEIGHT FORWARD OF THEIR ELBOW
giOX89zrQMc_16 HE ONE AND BRING THAT ELBOW FORWARD ANYONE MAKE SURE YOUR SHOULDERS ARE NO LOWER THAN YOUR ELBOWS
giOX89zrQMc_17 WHAT MOST PEOPLE TRY TO DO IS BRING THEIR SHOULDERS WEIGHT FORWARD AND THIS CAN CAUSE ROTATOR CUFF ISSUES ALL KINDS OF BAD PROBLEM
giOX89zrQMc_18 THE ONE KEEP YOUR SHOULDERS ROTATED BACK AND DOWN
giOX89zrQMc_20 AND SO THEN FATE CAN JUST LOWER RIGHT TO THAT POINT AND THEN BRING HER WEIGHT BOARDING COME RIGHT UP AND TEAR UP DOG
giOX89zrQMc_22 SO JUST RESTING IN THE HAMMOCK OF THE STRAP CAN IMPROVE THE ALIGNMENT OF YOUR CHINA ROUNDED ON DOESN'T
giOX89zrQMc_23 AND IT'S ALSO SAFETY DO IF YOU DO HAVE IN THE SHOULDER ISSUES
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_2 AND IN HIS SHELL SE INJURIES AND I'M A MODERN DANCE INSTRUCTOR IN AUSTIN TEXAS
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_3 I'M USING HOT DO UP HALF A TURN INTO A DEVELOP A WAY THAT I DID IN MODERN DANCE
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_4 SO FIRST OF ALL I'M THE STAR WITH MY FEET IN FIRST POSITION
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_5 MY HEELS AND TOES ARE TOUCHING
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_6 THEM AND THEN OPEN MY TOES UP TO FIRST POSITION
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_7 I DIDN'T PUT ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_8 IT'S A WAY THAT I LIKE TO START THEM
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_9 ALTHOUGH YOU CAN START WITH YOUR FEET TO GET
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_10 AND THEN IT BRING ONE ARM TO THE OTHER WALL AND BRING MY FOOT AND HALF
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_11 I'M INTO A SINGLE TURN THIS WAY
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_12 I USE MY ARMS TO GET SOME MOMENTUM AND TURN
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_13 AND COMING OUT OF IT AND GET A REACH MY ARMS THAT WHITE DEVELOPING A AND LEAN BACK
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_14 SO IT'S MUCH MORE MODERN DANCE
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_15 'CAUSE I'M REALLY GOOD LEAD INTO IT
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_16 A MINUTE AND THEN MY STANDING LEG A LITTLE BIT TO JUST ACCENTUATE
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_17 SO I START WITH KNEES BENT
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_18 FEEDING TURNED OUT
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_19 ONE ARM IN FRONT ONE ON TO THE SIDE
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_20 I TURN AND I DEVELOPED A ROUGH INTO A LESS
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_21 SO TO AND SEE THAT ONE MORE TIME WITHOUT WE TALKING
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_23 AND DEVELOP A INTO A LUNGE
gJ9b8V4PfqQ_24 SO THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO DO A HALF A TURN WITH THE DEVELOP A THAT YOU CAN ADD SOME ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR DANCE FOR TEA IN MIND IS
hIvoEhIvk0o_1 SO WE'RE GOING TO LEARN THE THIRD YOU ON THE G AND D STRING ON I'M SEEING THE IT STILL <UNK> FOR THE KENNEDY ONCE YOU HAVE TO YOUR SEE FIRST
hIvoEhIvk0o_2 OWNER I'M WHOM THINNER CD CAN KIND OF TUNE AGAINST YOUR B
hIvoEhIvk0o_3 AND IT'S A HALF STEP INTO AND BEANS THE SO TO GET THE C TONE WHOM DESCENT YOUR THIRD FINGER DOWN RIGHT NEXT TO THE SECOND FINGER AND THEN TO GET THE ON THE WITH THE FIRST THING AND THE HOME TO HARM CAHOON HOON IN AND JUST LOOKING AT IN A THIRTY HER WOULDN'T THINK OF YOUR SEE AS TUNING IT OUT SO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S IN TUNE WITH THE INNER GIGA ALSO TUNE WITH OFF OF
hIvoEhIvk0o_4 SO HOW DO HANAHAN HENNA ON WHOM TO HIRE A WHOM SO THAT'S THE THIRD WITH THE SCENE EIGHTY AND ADDED TO IT IN A BEGINNING TO PRACTICE BUYING FEET HEASTON
gvjqx8Sxfrw_1 NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE HARMONICS TO FORMS IN CHORDS
gvjqx8Sxfrw_2 NOW A HARMONIC AS YOU'LL SEE IN THE NEXT SERIES IS WHEN YOU WILL LIGHTLY TOUCH YOUR FINGER TO THE STRING WHEN NOT TO PRESS IT ENOUGH TO EITHER MUTE THE STRING OR HOW TO FRET AND NO
gvjqx8Sxfrw_3 NOW YOU CAN USE THE CENTER OF YOUR FINGER WHEN YOU USE HARMONICS
gvjqx8Sxfrw_4 IF YOU'RE ONLY PLAYING ONE STRING WILL JUST USE THE POINTY POUR OF YOUR FINGER PER
gvjqx8Sxfrw_5 AND EVEN A PUT THAT OVER THE TWELFTH FRET IS THAT IS PROBABLY THE STRONGEST PLACE A FIND ON THIS INSTRUMENT CALL IT TO GET HARMONIC STIRRING AT
gvjqx8Sxfrw_6 THIS WOULD BE CALLED NATURAL HARMONICS
gvjqx8Sxfrw_7 NOW YOU CAN MAKE CHORDS THAT OF THOSE IF YOU ADD THREE OR MORE HARMONICS TOGETHER THREE OR ANY NOTES TOGETHER WILL FORM OF CORE
gvjqx8Sxfrw_8 NOW SINCE THIS UKULELE ISN'T THE ONE THAT THE BEST INSTRUMENTS THAT YOU CAN GET UKULELES THAT ARE ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT HERE IS PROBABLY A RING OUT BEST ON THE TWELFTH FRET
gvjqx8Sxfrw_9 NOW SINCE THE NOTES INVOLVES ON THE TWELFTH FRET OF THE SAME AS THE OPEN STRINGS THAT ONLY OCCURS LITTLE THREAT IT IN THE OPEN STRINGS MAKE A C SIX CORE

HeiOS5o4TKM_1 HI THIS IS DAVID JACKEL ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO TALK TO ABOUT STUDYING SONG STRUCTURES
HeiOS5o4TKM_2 NOW AS YOU WRITE YOUR OWN SONGS HUMIDITY LOOKING FOR IDEAS IN WAYS TO BUILD THE STRUCTURES OF YOUR SONGS
HeiOS5o4TKM_3 AND IN MANY DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO DOING THIS
HeiOS5o4TKM_4 I THINK ONE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS YOU CAN DO IS STUDY OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK
HeiOS5o4TKM_5 MUCH LIKE PAINTERS IN SCHOOL WELL STUDY THE OIL PAINTINGS OF GREAT MASTERS IN AND LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT DETAILS IN DIFFERENT APPROACHES DONE
HeiOS5o4TKM_6 ONE AND DO THE SAME THING AS YOU WRITE SONGS
HeiOS5o4TKM_7 WE HAVE SOME TIME SIT DOWN WITH A RECORDING WORKABLE RECORDINGS OF SONGS THAT YOU REALLY LIKE GETTING NO PUBLISHED S AND MONTH RIGHT DOWN EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE SONG
HeiOS5o4TKM_8 START WITH THE INTRO RIGHT ON HOW MANY MEASURES IT HAPPENS FOR RIGHT DOWN THE VERSE ARE DOWN HOW MANY VERSES THERE ARE WHEN THE CHORUS COMES IN OUR DOWN THE BRAIDS RIGHT ON THE SOLE OF
HeiOS5o4TKM_9 MATT OUT THE ENTIRE SONG AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT AFTERWARDS AND ASK YOURSELF OKAY WITH THESE PEOPLE DO TO MAKE THE SONG SOUND LIKE IT DOES
HeiOS5o4TKM_10 ONCE YOU'VE TAKEN A LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLE SONGS THAT YOU CAN GO THE NEXT STEP AND THINK ABOUT WHICH YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WERE THAT SONG WRITER AND HOW YOU WOULD CHANGE THE STRUCTURE
HeiOS5o4TKM_11 BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HEAR A SONG WHICH YOU REALLY LIKE WITH THE NEW MAKING TO SELL FASHION OH WHAT IF I COULD I GO BACK AND I MAKE A SOLO HALF AS LONG IT'S TOO LONG THE OUTER TAKES TWO <UNK> OR MAYBE ONE OTHER CHORUS HERE MAYBE WE KNEW TRANSITIONAL BRIDGE HERE
HeiOS5o4TKM_12 AS YOU START TO STUDY OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK IN LEARN THE TECHNIQUE THEY USED TO GET TO THE POINT WE ARE READY TO START COMING UP WITH YOUR OWN TECHNIQUES AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T LOOK AT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE AND ON THE NEW RELIGIOUSLY RESTRICTED TO YOUR INITIAL IDEAS
HeiOS5o4TKM_13 SO BY ALL MEANS EXPOSURE SELF TO AS MANY DIFFERENT SONGWRITING AND AS YOU CAN
HeiOS5o4TKM_14 ONE LAST THING YOU CAN TRY TO AFTER YOU'VE BEEN STUDYING SOMEONE SONG STRUCTURE IS TO TAKE A SONG THAT YOU'VE WRITTEN RIGHT OUT THE STRUCTURE THE SAME WAY THAT YOU DID THERE IS TAKE A LOOK AT IT IN AND SAY FROM WHAT IF I TRY WITH THEY DID AND SWITCHES SONG AROUND A LITTLE BIT THAT WAY
HeiOS5o4TKM_15 IT'S A NATURAL IT'S NOT WHEN YOU WOULD INSTINCTIVELY DO BUT THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE WOULDN'T BELT UPON YOUR IDEAS IS TO BREAK WITH YOUR INITIAL INSTINCTS AND TRY NEW THINGS

gwmAYPMpAx4_1 IF YOU'VE EVER AND MARKED UPON OF PROFESSIONALLY RYAN WEIGHT LOSS OR EXERCISE PROGRAM IT'S MOST LIKELY THE FIRST THING YOU WERE TOLD YOU NEEDED TO GET WAS A HEART RATE MONITOR
gwmAYPMpAx4_2 THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STYLES AND HEIGHTS OF HEART RATE MONITORS END IN BASICALLY THE FUNCTION IS THE SAME
gwmAYPMpAx4_3 IT'S TO TAKE A RUNNING TALLY OF WHAT YOUR HEART RATE IS AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT AND TO HELP YOU WORK UP TOWARDS YOUR TARGET HEART RATE AND NOT EXCEED YOUR MAXIMUM HEART RATE
gwmAYPMpAx4_4 I THINK THAT JUST FOR THE DELAY MEN OF HEART RATE MONITORS NOT SUCH A TERRIBLE THING TO HAVE AS IT CAN HELP MAKE YOUR OWN WORKOUT IN WEIGHT LOSS EFFORTS MORE EFFICIENT WHETHER YOU'RE PART OF PROFESSIONAL PROGRAM OR NOT
gwmAYPMpAx4_5 A HEART RATE MONITOR START AT ABOUT FIFTY SIXTY DOLLARS AND WORK UP TO TWO OR THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR SOME OF THE SMALLER NON WORKOUT FINGERTIP VARIETIES
gwmAYPMpAx4_6 AND REALLY IT'S A MATTER OF WHAT'S GOING TO BE COMFORTABLE FOR YOU MIGHT PURPOSES ARE LOOKING TO USE THE HEART RATE MONITOR FOR
gwmAYPMpAx4_7 OR WORKOUT ORIENTED ONE OF COURSE IS FOR WORKING OUT

gM3izByOIUI_1 NOW I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LASER PRINTERS
gM3izByOIUI_2 THIS IS JUST IN A STANDARD HOME OR SMALL OFFICE LASER PRINTER AND THAT TREATMENT ANYBODY CAN GO AHEAD AND GET
gM3izByOIUI_3 NOW HALF THERE'S SEVERAL COMPONENTS ON IT
gM3izByOIUI_4 OF COURSE I HAVE MY PAPER FEEDBACK HERE
gM3izByOIUI_5 I HAVE TWO DIFFERENT TRAYS ACTUALLY FLOOR ON I IF I WANTED TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PAPER
gM3izByOIUI_6 SO I COULD HAVE MY STANDARD PAPER HERE AND MAYBE ENVELOPES OR I'VE MADE IN A DIFFERENT COLOR PAPER UP HERE ON THE OR DIFFERENT THICKNESS INSIDE SUCH AS SOME TYPE OF THE CARDBOARD OR WHATNOT
gM3izByOIUI_7 SO WE HAVE WE HAVE A LITTLE HALF OF LIFT BACK HERE WHICH CAN HOLD THE PAPER UP OF COURSE TO
gM3izByOIUI_8 AND WE HAVE A LIFT UP HERE THAT WILL HOLD THE PAPER ONE AND ACTUALLY COMES OUT AFTER BEING PRINTED
gM3izByOIUI_9 UP SOME GLUE AND CLOSE THAT THOUGH
gM3izByOIUI_10 IN THE EVENT OF THE PAPER GENDER SEVERAL THINGS YOU CAN DO
gM3izByOIUI_11 ON THIS PARTICULAR UNIT WHICH MOST OF THEM HAVE THE HOW THE TRAY ON THE BOTTOM OUT WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO HOLD PAPER OUT OF SOMETHING DOES GET STUCK
gM3izByOIUI_12 SO GO AHEAD AND CLOSE THAT BACK UP
gM3izByOIUI_13 SO IT REALLY IS OR PRINTER ACTUALLY DOES USE A TYPE OF LASER TO ON LEARNED THE IMAGE WHATEVER IT IS USUALLY TEXT ONTO THE PAPER
gM3izByOIUI_14 IT IS VERY VERY HOT AND IT IS NOT LIKE YOUR INK JET CARTRIDGES
gM3izByOIUI_15 SO ANYTHING THAT SAYS INKJET ONLY IS FAR'S PAPERS ARE TRANSPARENCIES THINGS LIKE THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO USE A LASER PRINTER
gM3izByOIUI_16 I FOUND IS OUR OUT THE HARD WAY THE OTHER DAY TRYING TO USE EIGHTY AND TEACHER TEE SHIRT TRANSFER PAPER INSIDE A LASER PRINTER AND I GOT THE GLUE EVERYWHERE
gM3izByOIUI_17 SO THAT'S OFTEN HAVE TO GO AHEAD AND CLEAN
gM3izByOIUI_18 SUCH AS USE REGULAR COPY PAPER TO DO ANYTHING YOU'RE GOING TO BE UP PRINTING WITH YOUR LASER PRINTER
gM3izByOIUI_19 SO IN SHOWING WHEN THIS UNIT I CAN GO AHEAD AND WHAT THE ENTIRE FRONT THAT WHICH YOU HAVE THE LASER PRINTERS ACTUALLY HAVING CALLED A TONER
gM3izByOIUI_20 SO THIS ONE HAS A GRIP GO AND YANK IT OUT
gM3izByOIUI_22 AND THIS IS ACTUALLY WOULD BURNS THE IMAGE ON TWO ON YOUR PAPER
gM3izByOIUI_23 SO THIS HAS THE INK BASICALLY THAT'LL BE IN HERE TO ON PUT THE IMAGE WHATEVER IT IS IF THE PICTURE OR TEXT ONTO YOUR PAPER
gM3izByOIUI_24 SO IN IT THAT YOU NOTICE THAT I DO TALLER ISN'T PRINTING CORRECTLY AND DOWN YOU HAVE SOME LETTERS ESSAY OR IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK AS CLEARS POSSIBLE GO AHEAD AND GET YOUR TONER SHAKE ON BEFORE GOING AHEAD AND REPLACING ON A GOOD HAND SHOOTING TRYING TO BUY A NEW ONE
gM3izByOIUI_25 THESE ARE KIND OF EXPENSIVE BUT THEY DO LAST A LONG TIME
gM3izByOIUI_26 SO IT'S A BLIND BLACK INK ALL A TON OF YOUR IN JET PRINTER GO AND GET YOURSELF A LEADER PRINTER
gM3izByOIUI_27 SO ONCE YOU'RE DONE CUP OF WHETHER IT'S A NEW ONE OR YOUR PLACEMENT IF YOU SHAKE IT
gM3izByOIUI_28 YOU GO AHEAD AND FLUFF LOCK IT BACK INTO PLACE
gM3izByOIUI_29 SO I HAVE SOME FANS HERE THAT KEEP EVERYTHING COOL
gM3izByOIUI_30 IT ACTUALLY SAYS THAT GOES UP TO THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIXTY RECESSED PRETTY HOT
gM3izByOIUI_31 SO IF YOU DON'T GO AHEAD AND CLOSE THE DOOR
gM3izByOIUI_32 IT'LL DO IT'S LITTLE RUN THROUGH
gM3izByOIUI_33 MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S RIGHT
gM3izByOIUI_34 US AND WE ARE IN JET PRINTER WOULD ON CYCLE THROUGH AND MAKE SURE YOUR YOUR HUNDRED CARTRIDGES OF IN PLACE PROPERLY
gM3izByOIUI_35 SO THAT'S WHAT INDICATOR LIKE THE SIDES YOU WHEN YOU TO LOAD PAPER IF THERE'S A GYM IF THERE'S AN ERROR OR WHATNOT
gM3izByOIUI_36 SO IT'S PRETTY SELF EXPLANATORY
gM3izByOIUI_37 YOU GO AHEAD AND TURN IT ON PLUG IT INTO COMPUTER AND GO AHEAD AND PRINT
gM3izByOIUI_38 SO IN WHEN YOU WERE PLACE JUST A LITTLE POINT WHEN YOU'RE PLACING YOUR TONER GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT TO A PROPER PLACE
gM3izByOIUI_39 THE TONERS A PRETTY TOXIC SO WHEN YOU BUY A NEW TONER ON THE USUALLY HAVE A RETURN SHIPPING BOX ON THE INSIDE THAT ALLOW YOU TO SEND IT BACK TO MANUFACTURE
gM3izByOIUI_40 AND SOMETIMES WILL GIVE YOU A CREDIT
gM3izByOIUI_41 YOU IF THEY DON'T HELPS ENVIRONMENT SO GO AHEAD PUT OUT YOUR PRINT AND ENJOY IT LATER

hK4Dwr5WR90_1 OKAY NOW THAT YOU'VE LEARNED THE THREE TURNS FOR MEN AND WOMEN IN PROFESSIONAL MODELING IF THE HALF TURN THE FULL TURN AND THE FADE AND IT'LL SHOW YOU IN THESE NEXT LET'S SOME COMBINATIONS THAT ARE HANDY TO USE WHEN YOU'RE ON A RAMP
hK4Dwr5WR90_2 FIRST OF ALL THE LADIES USING THE CATWALK UP AND THE HALF TURN
hK4Dwr5WR90_3 OVERLAP HALF TURN BACK UP THE RAMP
hK4Dwr5WR90_4 WIDGET OBSERVE IT AGAIN AND THE OVERLAP POINT RIGHT TOE AND COME BACK INTO THE BASIC
hK4Dwr5WR90_5 THE DIFFERENCE IN A MAN'S CATWALK OR STYLISH WALK IS WE LIKE TO REFER TO IT IS THAT THEY KEEP THE FEET SIDE BY SIDE
hK4Dwr5WR90_6 SO AS THEY MOVED LET'S DO THE DAY
hK4Dwr5WR90_7 THE ONLY TURN THAT USE IS THE FADE
hK4Dwr5WR90_8 ACTUALLY THAT'S WHEN I GET IT AT THE FRONT OF THE RAMP AND THE BACK OF THE RAMP
hK4Dwr5WR90_9 SO IT LAUNCHES THE MAN USES THE FADE TO THE RAMP AT THE TOP OF THE RAMP LITTLE ROCK STEP RIGHT HERE AND AS HE MOVES BACK UP TO THE TOP OF THE RAMP ANOTHER ROCKS STAY UP ANY OPENS BACKUP ENDING IN A BASIC JUST LIKE WE LEARNED IN THE FIRST POSITION FOR ME AND IN THE POSE ROUTINE
hK4Dwr5WR90_10 FOR THE WOMEN THAT CAN ALSO USE THE FULL TURN
hK4Dwr5WR90_11 SO LIGHTING THATS GOING USE THE FULL TURN AND THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DEGREES
hK4Dwr5WR90_12 AS I'M OVERLAPPING KNIFE EIGHT USING THE CATWALK OFF I'M GOING TO CROSS TURN OUT AND STEP INTO MANA HALF TURN ARE TURNING OUT SO THAT WHEN I GET TO THE END OF THE RAMP ONCE AGAIN I CLOSE IT WITH THE BASIC A VERY PROFESSIONAL WAY OF STANDEE AFTER YOU'VE DONE THE TURNS
hK4Dwr5WR90_13 AGAIN THE FULL TURN ARE TURNING ALL THE WAY CROSSING UP HALF TURN POINTING THE RIGHT FOOT TURNING LET BACK AGAIN AND POINTING THE RIGHT FOOT TURNING THE LENGTH CLOSING WITH THE BASIC
hK4Dwr5WR90_14 DON'T FORGET THE ARMS THEY DON'T SWING TO MATCH EVER
hK4Dwr5WR90_15 AND DOING A HALF TURN LADIES LIKING CANNOT LEASE TURNS
hK4Dwr5WR90_16 I CAN ONLY DO A HALF TURN WHEN I NEED TO DO OR I CAN DO A FULL TURN
hK4Dwr5WR90_17 AND THEN AND DO IT FOR THE BACKSIDE
hK4Dwr5WR90_18 LOTS OF TURNING
hK4Dwr5WR90_19 AND THE KNEE AND DON'T FORGET ONLY USE THE FADE
hK4Dwr5WR90_20 FEET SIDE BY SIDE UP AND WALKING BACK
hK4Dwr5WR90_21 NOW THE WOMEN HAVE LEARNED THREE TURNS THE HALF TURN THE FULL TURN AND THE FADE
hK4Dwr5WR90_22 IN GENTLEMAN IT'S EASIER FOR YOU
hK4Dwr5WR90_23 IT'S GREAT THAT YOU ONLY HAVE TO DO THE FADE VERY PROFESSIONAL TERM THAT YOU MIGHT USE ON THE RUNWAY

grsV1YN1z5s_2 I'M TRACY GOODWIN AND I'M THE RED SWEATER LADY
grsV1YN1z5s_3 AND TODAY WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO ANALYZE THE PLAY
grsV1YN1z5s_4 AND THIS IS THE FRANCIS HAUGE VERSION OF ANALYZING A PLAY
grsV1YN1z5s_5 NOW WE WHO MIGHT ANALYZE THE CLAY
grsV1YN1z5s_6 WELL IF YOU'RE AN ACTOR AND YOU'VE BEEN CAST AND PLAY YOUR YOU'VE BEEN ASSIGNED TO SOMETHING IN ONE OF YOUR THEATER CLASSES
grsV1YN1z5s_7 OR HUNTER DIRECTING A PLAY AND YOU WANT TO DO THE BEST DIRECTING JOB THAT YOU CAN
grsV1YN1z5s_8 WELL THE BEST WAY TO FIND OUT EVERYTHING ABOUT A CHARACTER
grsV1YN1z5s_9 THE BEST WAY TO FIND OUT HOW TO DIRECT THE PLAY TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT THE PLAY RIGHTS INTENTIONS WE'RE IS TO ANALYZE THE PLAY
grsV1YN1z5s_10 AND YOU CAN'T REALLY ANALYZE THE CLAY UNLESS YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC AT STEPS THAT YOU WANT TO FOLLOW
grsV1YN1z5s_11 OH ASHLEY THERE SOME VERY DETAILED AND VERY SPECIFIC STATS THAT WATER FOLLOW WOODEN ANALYZE THE CLAY
grsV1YN1z5s_12 AND WHILE THROUGH IT STEP BY STEP
grsV1YN1z5s_13 I AM COURAGE ENTERING AFTER THAT I'VE WORKED WITH WHETHER THEY'RE DOING A MONOLOGUE OR WHETHER THEY'RE DOING A SCENE OR EVEN IF THEY'VE BEEN HASTON AN ENTIRE PLAYER MOVIE TO ANALYZE THE ENTIRE PIECE
grsV1YN1z5s_14 THAT WAY THAT YOU KNOW THE FULL CONCEPT OF THE CHARACTER AND HIS ROLL OR HURT ROLE IN THE WORLD OF THE PLAY
grsV1YN1z5s_15 SO LET'S GET STARTED
GD-8n8PDl44_1 BUT WHAT I WANT TO POINT OUT IF I MAY IS THAT HAND WRITING IS SO ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL
GD-8n8PDl44_2 AND WITHOUT THE ALPHABET WE EVERYTHING WOULD FALL APART
GD-8n8PDl44_3 EVERYTHING IN OUR CULTURE DEPENDS UPON THE ALPHABET
GD-8n8PDl44_4 ALWAYS SAVE YOURSELF WHAT WE HAVE COMPUTERS OH EXCUSE ME BUT COMPUTERS DEPEND ON THE ALPHABET
GD-8n8PDl44_5 IF THE OVEN THAT WERE TO DISAPPEAR COMPUTERS WITH HAVE NOTHING NO WEIGHT ORGANIZED
GD-8n8PDl44_6 THEY WOULDN'T BE THEY WOULD JUST FALL APART
GD-8n8PDl44_7 AND THEN IT WOULD BE NO SIGNS IN AND IT WOULD BE NO HAND READING TO SIGN OR TRACKS AND AT EVERYTHING WITH JUST GO RIGHT DOWN THE TUBES
GD-8n8PDl44_8 SO PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ALPHABET IS CAN BE PRETTY IMPORTANT
GD-8n8PDl44_9 YOU KNOW WHAT I DO WHEN I'M THE CHILDREN IF THEY'RE AROUND AN AGED WHEN I KNOW THEY MIGHT BE LEARNING ABOUT THE AFTER THAT I ASKED THEM THIS FIG IMPORTANT QUESTION
GD-8n8PDl44_10 I SAY HOW'S YOUR ALPHABET
GD-8n8PDl44_11 AND THEN THEY DON'T HONEY ANSWER THAT
GD-8n8PDl44_12 SO THEN I SAY WHENEVER I THINK THEY ARE READY TO HEAR ABOUT THE ALPHABET
GD-8n8PDl44_13 AND I MENTION TO THEM THAT I AND I AM THE ALPHABET DOCTOR
GD-8n8PDl44_14 SO SOMETIMES I WIND UP GETTING THEM THEIR OWN ALPHABET
GD-8n8PDl44_15 THIS IS KEVIN STAFF AND
GD-8n8PDl44_16 AND SOMETIMES I WIND OF MAKESHIFT DEAL WITH THE PARENTS AND I GET THAT SAME CHILD WHAT I CALL AN EYE TO TEST
GD-8n8PDl44_17 AND I HAVE FOUND IF THAT I CAN SIT DOWN WITH THE CHILD AND I CAN JUST USING THE ALPHABET OKAY AS OUR BASE OF OPERATIONS
GD-8n8PDl44_18 I CAN DETERMINE ALL KINDS OF THINGS ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE OFF OF THAT CHILD THERE WAS CAN BE QUICK THINGS
GD-8n8PDl44_19 BUT I CAN DETERMINE TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT I HAVE HAD PARENTS A TOMATO YET WELL THAT'S WHAT THEY CAME UP WITH IN IN SCHOOL
GD-8n8PDl44_20 IN OH THAT'S WITH A PSYCHOLOGIST CAME UP WITH
GD-8n8PDl44_21 AND I THINK I CAN GO ONE BETTER BECAUSE THE THING IS THAT OF JUST TESTING THEM AT THAT POINT AND IN THAT EXPERIENCE I CAN ALSO GIVE THEM SOME OR I CAN OPEN SOME DOORWAYS FOR THEM
ga1ENQpm660_2 SORRY CANNOT PERFECTLY
ga1ENQpm660_3 HERE'S OUR C BUT THAT A FEW
ga1ENQpm660_4 A SLIGHTLY THAT ARE FORM
ga1ENQpm660_5 AGAIN THE C WITH THE SKIN SKIN BONES IN THIS SEE DOWN HERE IS JUST THE SKELETAL IDEA BUT WHAT I WANT YOU TO NOTICE IS THAT THERE IS IN ALL OF THESE LETTERS WHAT WE CALL A DUCT IS OUR LINING SEQUENCE
ga1ENQpm660_6 SO ON IT'S THE ORDER IN WHICH ARE PUTTING YOUR STROKES
ga1ENQpm660_7 IN THE A IT'S ONE TWO THREE
ga1ENQpm660_8 IN THE B IT'S ONE TWO THREE AND THE SEE IT'S A NICE ROUNDED ROUNDED FEELING TO THIS LETTER AND WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO ABOUT HERE YOU CAN GO A LITTLE BIT STRAIGHTER COME BACK UP TO HERE AND COME AROUND AND A LITTLE BIT STRAIGHTER
ga1ENQpm660_9 WHEN LEARNING BY STRAIGHTER
ga1ENQpm660_10 IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE CALL IT A STRAIGHT CURVE
ga1ENQpm660_11 IT'S INSTEAD OF STAYING ROUNDED AS YOU WOULD WITH THE ARROW
ga1ENQpm660_12 SO HERE IT IS ONE OF THE FOR SECRETS THAT UNDER REVEAL FEEL
ga1ENQpm660_13 THERE'S A NATURAL PRINCIPAL THAT'S AT WORK WITH THIS SEE IF WE CLOSE THIS C UP TOO MUCH IT'S CAN BE RED AS AN O

h60rjRm21Qo_10 IT'S A HINT OF LATCHES WHICH LAN WORKS THE INTERVIEW
HIro8eQgC7Q_1 OKAY NEXT TECHNIQUE IS A DOUBLE WRIST GRAB
HIro8eQgC7Q_2 NOW YOU SHOULD BE AWARE ASTRONOMY SO YOU SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN YOU ANYWAY
HIro8eQgC7Q_3 LET'S SAY A FEMALE AN ABUSIVE THE HUSBAND WHOEVER IS ATTACKING YOU THERE'S ONE WAY TO GET OUT OF IT
HIro8eQgC7Q_4 IN THAT HOLE FOR AS YOU OF OTHER OPTIONS STRIPE WITH
HIro8eQgC7Q_5 YOU MAY NOT REAL ESTATE WITH YOUR ARMS ARE EFFECTIVELY REGULAR OF MY HEAD THAT MY HEAD IN MY KNEES AVAILABLE SO YOU HAVE A TO SOFTEN LOCK
HIro8eQgC7Q_6 I BUT HIS NOSE BREAK HIS NOSE IF YOU WILL NEED OF A DRAWING THIS LITTLE BIT OF A LOVE TAP
HIro8eQgC7Q_7 GIVE IT A LITTLE DOUBT OUT AROUND WITH
HIro8eQgC7Q_8 RISERS STEP AND DOWN IF HE STILL HOLDING ON A V LET'S GO IT'S FUNNY FLAT YOU GET BACK TO THE SIDE
HIro8eQgC7Q_9 NOW ALL WE CARRY BRING THE WRIST UP HIS HEAD UNEARTH REFLECTIVE
HIro8eQgC7Q_10 GRAB UNDERNEATH WITH THIS HAND THUMB ON THE BACK OF THE HAND THE OTHER ONE COMES OVER ON SAT ENTERS SETS THAT ARE LEFT FOOT BACK IN A CIRCLE IF YOU REALLY WANT POWERED WEIGHT IS REST
HIro8eQgC7Q_11 THERE WE GO SO NOW SHOW OF COVERAGE A MOMENT THEM A LITTLE BIT NIA INSIDE POSITION TO FINISH WITH FUN
HIro8eQgC7Q_12 SOCCER KICK DIFFERENT HAND I'M AS WELL THEY WILL THE SUN BOOKS AVAILABLE REUTERS'S ALL AND THINGS <UNK>
HIro8eQgC7Q_13 INITIALLY THAT AGAIN
HIro8eQgC7Q_14 THE MORE OF TRAFFIC CHANGED <UNK> THAT I CAN GET WITH WHOM SUPPLIES AND COME IN WITH A HALF OF WORK HIS NOSE USE COTTON GOING GO NOW JUMPER WAY WING ALL RIGHT HERE GRUNT UNDERNEATH SOME OF THE BACK OF THE HAND FOUR FINGERS HERE FOR POWER IN OREGON RULE OR GRABS A FEW ON TOP STEP BACK WITH THE LITTLE LIGHT FOR POWER IN A CIRCLE COOL HIS LIKE ERICA BROKEN ADDRESS LATER IN EXCEL POSITION THE DROPS OF HAUNCHES
HIro8eQgC7Q_15 SOCKET THE HEAD IS THAT STILL THAT I LIKE TO DO A KNEELING THAT ARM LIKE RIGHT THERE AS OR ON
HIro8eQgC7Q_17 SO AS ALL CAN DEFOLLETS THIS WAY
HIro8eQgC7Q_18 SERGER DOUBLE WHISK BAD TECHNIQUE
GdwI5f0-sJc_1 HOW MANY <UNK> AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GdwI5f0-sJc_2 WE'RE IN TALK TODAY IS UM BIRDS THAT BY
GdwI5f0-sJc_3 THE NUMBER ONE REASON THAT MOST PARENTS BIKE IS OUT OF HERE
GdwI5f0-sJc_4 SO IF YOU LEARN IS BITING THE NUMBER ONE WAY FOR YOU TO GET YOUR BIRD STOUT BITING IS TO FIGURE OUT WHILE YOUR BIRD IS RIDING AND CHANGE IT CITY OR NO LONGER THREATENING IS ANIMAL IS NO LONGER FRIGHTENED
GdwI5f0-sJc_5 THE OBVIOUSLY PUSHING YOURSELF ON THIS BIRD WHICH FLATTENED OR SOMETHING IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE THAT THIS IS THE LAST FOR THE SELF DEFENSE
GdwI5f0-sJc_6 MOST BIRDS AND STYLE WOULD CHOOSE TO FLY AWAY VERSES AGGRESSIVELY BITING YOU
GdwI5f0-sJc_7 SO MOST BIRDS WHEN THEY BITE IS LIKE A JOB THAT BITES ME FEEL CORNER
GdwI5f0-sJc_8 SO YOU NEED TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE THIS ON THE STRINGS MORE COMFORTABLE
GdwI5f0-sJc_9 IF YOU HAVE A BIRD THAT BITES THAN YOU WANNA GET A PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR OUT OF THEM SUCH AS STEP UP THERE IF YOU'VE GOT THEM ALREADY ON HAND
GdwI5f0-sJc_10 AND YOU'RE IN A GOOD GIRL
GdwI5f0-sJc_11 LET'S SAY FOR INSTANCE TURN ONE AND A BITE ME AS ABOUT JUST EASILY LIKES A STEP UP AND INSTEAD OF STEPPING UP KNIFE SHEATH SWITCHED AND SHE DECIDED THAT TRYING TO BITE MY HANDS WHEN WE DO IS JUST AS SHOES REACHING WITH <UNK> OF ASHES REACHING FOR VERBEEK WEDGES OF WOBBLE MY HAND EVER SO SLIGHTLY JUST LIKE THIS AS USE REACHING A BITE
GdwI5f0-sJc_12 WHAT THAT DOES IS THE NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT THEY DON'T LIKE LOSING YOUR BALANCE AND SO IT'LL STOP THE BITING HITTER
GdwI5f0-sJc_13 YOU CAN DO THIS TWO OR THREE TIMES UNTIL YOU CAN OFFER HAND AND SHE'S A LONGER TRIES TO BITE BEFORE STANDING UP ONTO THE NEXT PAINT
GdwI5f0-sJc_14 THAT'S ONE WAY TO START IN A JUST KEEP THEM FROM BITING FROM ONE HAND TO THE NEXT
GdwI5f0-sJc_15 AGAIN ESPECIALLY OF CAUSING IT TO BE A MORE POSITIVE EXPERIENCE IT IMMEDIATELY KICKING KEEP YOU FROM GETTING IT IN
GdwI5f0-sJc_16 OF THE OTHER WAY AGAIN IS TO REACH FROM BEHIND THE BIRD
GdwI5f0-sJc_17 THE LAST METHOD TO UM KEEP PROVIDING IS TO ON OBVIOUSLY ON JUST ON OFFER DISTRACTION OF THE SAME TIME
GdwI5f0-sJc_18 IF YOU'RE IN ONE OF THE BITE WHAT WE DO IS I'D SAY STEP UP AT THE SAME TIME OF SIGHT LEVERAGE CAN FLY SPEAKING SHE'S NOT INTERACT WITH ME
GdwI5f0-sJc_19 YOU'D OFFER DISTRACTIONS SO IF I WAS GOING ASK A STEP UP AT THE SAME TIME I OFFER TO STEP UP AND OFFER DISTRACTION THE SAME TIME THIS CAN BE A PIECE OF IN A POPSICLE STICK WE'RE ARM YOU KNOW A PIECE OF FOOD IS HOW MANY OTHER AND AN S AND YOU DO THE TWO I'M ACTIVITY SIMULTANEOUSLY
GdwI5f0-sJc_20 SEE OFFER FOOD WALL OFFERING YOUR HAND
GdwI5f0-sJc_21 IT'S OFTEN TIMES DISTRACTING ENOUGH TO BREAK THE BITE BEHAVIOR
GdwI5f0-sJc_22 SO THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS TO STOP BITING ON THE NUMBER ONE LACE DISTRACTS ON ANY OTHER A NUMBER ONE WAY WOULD BE ON TO THE ROUTE WHY THE BIRD ONCE TO BY TWO IN THE FIRST PLACE AND CHANGE UP THEIR ENVIRONMENT
GdwI5f0-sJc_23 TRY TO CREATE THE UM SITUATION SITUATED IS POSITIVE BIRD WANTS TO INTERACT ON SO THAT HE DOESN'T WANT BY TWO INSTEAD
GVWXveM_fzE_1 THE FOUR BALL SIDE BY SIDE MULTIPLEX STAR
GVWXveM_fzE_2 JUST LIKE THE THREE BALL MULTIPLEX START IT'S A COOL WAY STAR
GVWXveM_fzE_3 I MEAN IT'S BETTER THAN JUST DOING THIS
GVWXveM_fzE_4 PEOPLE LIKE TO SEE A GOOD FLASHING MOVE TO START
GVWXveM_fzE_5 SO THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD ONE AND IT'S PRETTY BASIC
GVWXveM_fzE_6 STEP TO FOUR BALLS IN YOUR HAND LIKE THIS AND CRACK
GVWXveM_fzE_7 IT'S A WRIST MOTION IN WHICH YOU GO TO DO IS IN THE AIR YOU WANT THEM TO SPLIT INFORM COLUMNS
GVWXveM_fzE_8 IT'S VERY EASY THE BOTTOM TO YOU CATCH AND THEN IT AUTOMATICALLY COLUMNS JUST LIKE THAT
GVWXveM_fzE_9 IT'S A FLICK AND THE REST OF THE THIGH
GVWXveM_fzE_10 THAT WAS THE SMOOTHEST EVER BUT YOU GET THE YOU THE POINT
GVWXveM_fzE_11 THAT IS A VERY COOL START IN IT DOESN'T TAKE A WHOLE LOT OF PRACTICE AND IT DOESN'T TAKE A WHOLE LOT OF TECHNIQUE
GVWXveM_fzE_12 IT'S FAIRLY SELF-EXPLANATORY
GVWXveM_fzE_13 THE KEY ONCE AGAIN IS IN THE RISK FLICK
GVWXveM_fzE_14 SO WORK ON THAT AND YOU HAVE A GOOD FOUR BALL STAR
gWeZqePefHE_1 SO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE YOURSELF AN ANKLE SUPPLY AS ALWAYS OF ON RAGS AND PAPER TOWELS
gWeZqePefHE_2 AND WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH A MESSY BUSINESS OF IT HE SAYS YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ON SOMETHING AVAILABLE THAT'S CLEAN AND DRY ON IN ORDER FOR YOU TO WIPE OFF
gWeZqePefHE_3 INTENDING TEASER FINGERS A LIE ON
gWeZqePefHE_4 YOU'LL SEE AS I GO ON ON FURTHER BUT ON I ALWAYS LIKE TO HAVE A NICE UP CLEANER TOWEL THAT I TEND TO USE WHEN I AM PREFER THE SHOT TOWELS ON MOSTLY BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE USING ANY SORT OF STANDARD KITCHEN TOWELS ON THEY TEND TO BREAK APART FALL APART AND ACTUALLY GET STUCK TO YOUR FINGERS AS YOU'RE TRYING TO WIPE OFF ADHESIVES
gWeZqePefHE_5 THESE ARE MORE LIKE OF FABRIC SO THEY DON'T TEND TO FALL APART IS EASY ON THEN ALSO THEY'RE GREAT FOR USING ACTUALLY ON THE SURFACE OF YOUR PIECE FOR CLEANING UP EDGES AND WIPING AWAY ON EXTRA ADHESIVE THAT'S MAYBE ON THEN APPLY INTO THICKLY
gWeZqePefHE_6 SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING CLEAN AND DRY TO WORK WITH AND HAVE AN ANGLE SUPPLY VECTOR PAPER TOWELS OF THAT IF YOU SHOULD RUN THROUGH THEM ALL YOU HAVE EXTRAS TO USE AND YOU CAN JUST THROW WHEN WORKING WITH
H6qfaaYf5RI_1 AND NOW WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT DOING ITS BEEN TRIGGS WITH THE TASSEL SPIN
H6qfaaYf5RI_2 ON THE FIRST OR YOUR DOCK MOUTH IS SPINNING THE CRYSTAL STICK UNDERNEATH YOUR LEG
H6qfaaYf5RI_3 WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT DOING THIS WITH JUST THE NORMAL THICK TALK A NORMAL SPIN
H6qfaaYf5RI_4 THE CREASE TASSEL SPIN TECHNIQUE IS VERY DIFFERENT
H6qfaaYf5RI_5 IT LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THAT
H6qfaaYf5RI_6 NOW WHAT I'M ACTUALLY DOING ISN'T SPINNING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE STICK GETTING IT OUTSIDE SPIN ON THE TASSEL TAKING MY LEG OVER LETTING THE STICK JUST ROLL OVER MY LEG LIKE THAT AND BACK OUT TO MY RIGHT CONTROL STICK JUST LIKE THAT
H6qfaaYf5RI_7 NOW TO WORK ON THIS YOU HAVE TO GET THIS CATCH DOWN A YOU'D HAVE TO BE USED TO KICK YOUR LEG UP AND CATCHING THE UP UNDERSIDE OF THE CRYSTAL STICK ON OR TIE THE TOP SIDE THE CRYSTAL STICK ON THE UNDERSIDE OF YOUR LEG AT THE RIGHT BALANCE POINT THAT JUST BINS OVER NICE AND EASY LIKE THAT
H6qfaaYf5RI_8 THAT'S UNDER THE LEG WITH A TASSEL SPIN
H6qfaaYf5RI_9 NOW I'M I REALLY LIKE THIS TRICK
H6qfaaYf5RI_10 IS ONE MY FAVORITES AND THAT'S WHAT THE MAIN REASONS AND LIVE CRYSTAL STICKS AND SAID DOUBLE SIX IS THAT I CAN OF EXECUTE THAT RIGHT THERE
gcHR4jFmiis_1 BEFORE YOU PULLING A CAVE DON'T LET ALONE AND DON'T GLUE WHEAT OF THE THIGH
gcHR4jFmiis_2 IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT

h4MIaET-34Q_5 SO THE STAPLES IS ON BITS OF THE MOST OF THE EASIEST WAY TO ATTACH THE CURTAINS AND IT'S ALSO OVEN WILL ONLY MOST SECURE WEIGHTS THAT'S WHY WE CHOSE TO USE IT
h4MIaET-34Q_6 AND BECAUSE WHEN RECOVERY ENOUGH WE DIDN'T MINE HAVING A STAPLE SHOWED THROUGH
h4MIaET-34Q_7 SO NOW I HAVE THE CURTAINS ATTACHED TO THE BORDER
h4MIaET-34Q_8 WE GO AHEAD AND PLACE THE OTHER PIECE OF FELT AND PUT RIGHT ACROSS THE TOP AND IT'LL ALSO COMPLETE THE LOOK OF THE CURTAINS
h4MIaET-34Q_9 IF YOU WANTED TO HAVE HIS PIECE OF FELT STANDING UP JUST A DRAW TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE THE BORDER OF A REAL REAL THE ONSET OF CURTAINS
h4MIaET-34Q_10 WE'RE RELATE STRAIGHTER FLAT ACROSS AND IT IS BY PUTTING GLUE RIGHT ON TO THE FELT
h4MIaET-34Q_11 IT CAN BE SOLID GENEROUS WITH IT BECAUSE THE THE FELT NEEDS A ON NICE COAT FOR IT TO TO STICK SECURELY TO THE OTHER PIECE OF FELT
h4MIaET-34Q_12 ONCE YOU'VE PUT IN NICE LINE OF GLUE ACROSS THE FELT TO GO AHEAD AND STICK IT RIGHT ON TO THE BORDER
h4MIaET-34Q_13 AND A GLUE THAT SQUEEZED THROUGH THE FELT IS ARE PRESSING DOWN WILL DRY CLEAR OF USING A A WHITE GLUE REGULAR CRAFT GLUE THAT WILL BE A PROBLEM
h4MIaET-34Q_14 AND WE SEE THAT ONCE WE PUT THE BORDER ON THE STAND UP THE CURTAINS REALLY MAKE THE THE THEATER LOOK LIKE A AROUND AND AUTHENTIC THEATER IT'S A NICE EFFECT AND DOWN IT'S SOMETHING THAT I REALLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO WHEN I'M MAKING YOUR YOUR PUPPET THEATER TO AT ON THESE CURTAINS

h2ABWJrf0-I_8 THE VENT LIVE
hiQgVOuHeRc_1 ANOTHER STRETCH THAT WE LEARNED WHEN THAT ARE GOING TO FIND AND IS A GREAT USED WHEEL ST HALF MODIFIED STRAIGHT LEG IF AND RELAX
hiQgVOuHeRc_2 NOW WATCH AND YOU GO AND YOU RE TRYING TO DO IS WHEN WE RELAX OR A SLIGHT BEND THE LEGS
hiQgVOuHeRc_3 SO YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IT AS THOUGH IT'S A ROMANIAN DEAD LIFT OR IT'S A BACK HYPER EXTENSION
hiQgVOuHeRc_4 ANY DECREASE THE HIPS
hiQgVOuHeRc_5 BUT THE HIPS GO BACK FIRST KEEPING LEG STRAIGHT
hiQgVOuHeRc_6 GO AHEAD LOOK BODY COME DOWN AND YOU GET A FEEL IS IMMEDIATELY THROUGH THE HAMSTRINGS AND ESPECIALLY IN THE CALVES AND BEHIND THE BACK SNAKES

hiQgVOuHeRc_17 IN THE ONLY THAT'S A PROTECTING YOUR BACK <UNK>
hiQgVOuHeRc_18 WHEN COME IN AND THEN THE KNEES
hiQgVOuHeRc_19 REASON
hbcjpXqGSHU_1 SUIT THAT PRODUCT NASA IS ANOTHER BOUND ANGLE POSE
hbcjpXqGSHU_2 SO AGAIN WHEN YOU USE YOUR STRAPS
hbcjpXqGSHU_3 YOU WILL BEGIN IN FAT ACROSS THE CONNECTING THE SOLES OF YOUR FEET AND WITH COMFORT ONE BEING THE HEELS AS CLOSE TO GROW AS YOU CAN CONTINUE TO LIFT IN LENGTHEN YOUR SPINE
hbcjpXqGSHU_4 THERE'S WE'LL TAKE YOUR STRAP PLEAT AROUND YOUR LOWER BACK AND THE INSIDE BOTH LEGS
hbcjpXqGSHU_5 TAKE THE SIDE WITH OUT THE BUCKLE AROUND YOUR FEET OFF THE AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO SITE WITHOUT THE BUCKLE CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT THE BUCKLE USED IN IT CAN BECOME UNCOMFORTABLE
hbcjpXqGSHU_6 AND THEN WE'LL JUST LOCK YOURSELF IN
hbcjpXqGSHU_7 MOVE THAT IF YOU PULL YOUR STRAP TOO TIGHT WHEN YOU GO TO RECLINE WITH THAT HAPPENS RECLINER DEFEATED IN A PICK UP
hbcjpXqGSHU_8 WHAT WE WANT THE STRAP TO DO IS DRAW THE HEELS CLOSER INCH HERE GROWING AS YOU BEGIN TO RECLINING
hbcjpXqGSHU_9 IF YOU GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOK AT JENNIFER OF BRINGING HERSELF BACK INTO THE QUICK LINE POSITION IT WITH THE THAT THE HEELS BECOME CLOSER IN TO THE GROINS IN THE BELT THE SUPPORTING ALL THE WORK
hbcjpXqGSHU_10 AND JUST CONTINUE TO OPEN THE ARMS ENCOURAGING THE IN ACOSTA MUSCLES TO BEGIN TO STRETCH THE OPENING THE GROINS SEIZURES OVER THE WAYS TO THE KNEES AND JUST CREATING FLEXIBILITY IN HER KNEES
hbcjpXqGSHU_11 BE SURE THAT SHE SUPPORTS ON HER SHOULDERS NEVER ON THE NECK AND THE CERVICAL VERTEBRAE IS IN THE NECK
hbcjpXqGSHU_12 AND THEN TO BEGIN TO SEE IF SHE CAN FEEL THE BELLY RISE WITH EVERY INHALE AND FALL WITH EVERY EXHALE
hbcjpXqGSHU_13 TO SHAKE IT FEEL THE LOW BACK EXPLAINING AND RISE AND FALL
hbcjpXqGSHU_14 SO THE BREATH IS GOING FRONT AND BACK SIDE TO SIDE THE TOP TO BOTTOM
GD5-_-fIAOg_1 THE BEST WAY TO KNOW THAT ARE TRULY IN LABOR IS IF YOU HAVE PROGRESSIVE CONTRACTIONS
GD5-_-fIAOg_2 THESE MEANS THE OR CONTRACTIONS ARE GETTING CLOSER TOGETHER AND THEY'RE GETTING LONGER
GD5-_-fIAOg_3 NOW WHEN YOUR CONTRACTION START THEY MIGHT BE REALLY FAR APART
GD5-_-fIAOg_4 THEY MIGHT BE THIRTY MINUTES OF PART OF THE MIGHT BE FORTY FIVE MINUTES APART
GD5-_-fIAOg_5 THAT IF YOU NOTICE THAT PATTERN IF YOU NOTICE THAT EVERY FORTY FIVE MINUTES OR EVERY THIRTY MANAGER DATING A CONTRACTION THAT CONTRACTION PROBABLY WOULD LAST ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS AND THAT'S HOW WE ARE REALLY GOOD SIGN THAT YOU ARE IN LABOR
GD5-_-fIAOg_6 IS DOUBLE LONG WAYS TO GO
GD5-_-fIAOg_7 IT STILL EARLY LABOR WHICH AGAIN AND NOTICE THAT EVENTUALLY OVER TIME THIS CONTRACTIONS ARE GET CLOSER TOGETHER AND ARE GONNA GET LONGER
GD5-_-fIAOg_8 WHEN YOU HAVE A BRAXTON HICK USUALLY THE STAND UP OR YOU CHANGE POSITIONS THAT CONTRACTION IS GONNA GO AWAY
GD5-_-fIAOg_9 IF THE OPPOSITE WITH SHOE LABOR CONTRACTIONS
GD5-_-fIAOg_10 WHEN YOU CHANGE POSITIONS WALK AROUND OR STAND OUT IT'S MOST LIKELY BE YOU CONTRACTION IS GONNA GET HARDER AND STRONGER AND IT'S GONNA BE MORE INTENSE
GD5-_-fIAOg_11 WHICH IS A GOOD THING BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP MOVING AROUND YOU WANNA GET THOSE LABOR PAINS GOING TO HOEFLING MAKE OUT LABOR NOT LAST AS LONG
GD5-_-fIAOg_12 SO WHEN YOU GET A CONTRACTION AND START TO THE TOP OF YOUR UTERUS AND WORKS ITS WAY DOWN
GD5-_-fIAOg_13 THE UTERUS IS LIKE FINGERS IN THE WAY IT IS ALL TOGETHER
GD5-_-fIAOg_14 SOMEONE IN IS SAY BAIT IT FEELS LIKE LILY HARD MENSTRUAL CRAMPS
GD5-_-fIAOg_15 EITHER WOMEN FEEL AT TIGHTENING SENSATION
GD5-_-fIAOg_16 EITHER WOMEN MIGHT FEEL IT IN THE BACK OF DEPENDING ON THE POSITION OF THE BABY
GD5-_-fIAOg_17 SOME WOMEN PHILIP THEY HAVE GAS WHEN IT'S JUST STARTING
GD5-_-fIAOg_18 IT'S VERY HARD TO DESCRIBE WHAT A LABOR PAIN FEELS LIKE BECAUSE IT FEELS DIFFERENT FOR EVERYONE
GD5-_-fIAOg_19 SO THE UTERUS IS CALLED A FUNGUS
GD5-_-fIAOg_20 AND THE UTERUS IS MADE OUT OF DIFFERENT WHAT DIFFERENT LIGAMENTS ALMOST AND THEY'RE LIKE FINGERS
GD5-_-fIAOg_21 THE COMMON TOGETHER LIKE THIS IF IN THE COMMON TOGETHER LIKE THIS
GD5-_-fIAOg_22 AND THEY'RE ALL OVER
GD5-_-fIAOg_23 SO WHAT HAPPENS IS FROM THE TOP OF THE UTERUS THIS FINGER START SQUEEZING
GD5-_-fIAOg_24 AS YOU HAVEN'T SENSATIONS THIS WAY THE HAVING SENSATIONS THIS WAY THEY'RE HAVING SENSATIONS THIS WAY
GD5-_-fIAOg_25 AND THOSE FINGERS AND WORK DOWN AND YOU CAN FEEL IT TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF YOUR UTERUS
GD5-_-fIAOg_26 TWIN FOR BEGINNING WHEN YOU'RE CONTRACTIONS ARE NOT VERY STRONG IT JUST MIGHT BE THE OR STOMACH IT'S HARD
GD5-_-fIAOg_27 THAT'S YOUR UTERUS CONTRACT IN
GD5-_-fIAOg_28 AND MEASURE UTERUS RELAX THE YOUR STOMACH IS GONNA GET SOFT AGAIN
GD5-_-fIAOg_29 SO GREAT WAY TO KNOW THE JAW OR TRULY IN LABOR IS WHEN YOU HAVE CONTRACTIONS GET CLOSER TOGETHER AND LAST LONGER

ggNy8KwhoFY_15
h39vEROaZc4_1 NOW THE THING THAT WE'VE CREATED IT'S A WAY TO STAND UP ON TO THE BASE OF OUR STAGE SO THAT SHOULD HOW TO MAKE A TO MAKE THE WOODEN STICKS GO INSIDE THE CORRUGATED PAPER AND THAT WILL CREATE A STAND IN ORDER FOR US TO STICK INSIDE THE BASE OF THE STAGE
h39vEROaZc4_2 SO IF WE CUT OUR STRIPS CORRECTLY THE AND THE LINES OF THE CORRUGATED PAPER SHOULD BE RUNNY ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE STRIP
h39vEROaZc4_3 SO I HAVE ROOM TO TAKE ANY FIT IN THE SKEWER AND PUT IT INSIDE THE KNEE OPENING OF THE CORRUGATED PAPER
h39vEROaZc4_4 BUT FOR A SLOW TO IS AND WHAT I USE THE FULL LENGTH OF THE STICK IT'S NOT NECESSARY SOME GOING TO CUT A PIECE ANIMAL TO BE LEFT WITH A PIECE PROBABLY ABOUT ON FIVE INCHES IS IS IT IS A GOOD SIZE
h39vEROaZc4_5 AND I CUT TWO STICKS LIKE THAT
h39vEROaZc4_6 AND ALL THAT I GO AHEAD AND STICK IT INSIDE THE CORRUGATED PAPER
h39vEROaZc4_7 IF THE OF TROUBLE GETTING THE INTERVIEW THEN USE THE THICK ENOUGH CORRUGATED PAPER EVEN ON TWIST MISTAKE BACK AND FORTH AND WILL SLIDE IN OR EVEN JUST PRESS IT DOWN ON TO A HARD SURFACE BECAUSE ON BE THE STICKS SHOULD FIT RIGHT INTO THE ON A LOT RIGHT ALONG THE LINES OF THE CORRUGATED PAPER
h39vEROaZc4_8 EVEN A FLOOR ABOUT IT ON PUSHING ITSELF OUT OR TEARING THE FRAME
h39vEROaZc4_9 SO WE PUT IT IN HIGH ENOUGH SO THAT IT CREATES A MOVIE STAR IT WILL CREATE A NICE BASE AND YOU SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH LEFT OUT TO BE ABLE TO STICK INTO THE BASE OF THE STAGE
h39vEROaZc4_10 IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE PART OF THE STICK THAT STICKING OUT SHOULD BE BOWL EVENTUALLY EVEN SO THAT THE FRAME STAND STRAIGHT UP AND BUT BY THE WEIGHT OF THE THE BORDER THE THICKNESS OF THE CORRUGATED PAPER AND ALSO THE STICKS AND INSIDE THIS WILL CREATE A NICE STRONG STURDY SUPPORT TO LET THE BEYOND BORDER STAND UP STRAIGHT ON TO THE BASE OF THE STAGE
h39vEROaZc4_11 SO NOW I'VE SHOWN YOU HOW TO INSERT THE WOODEN SKEWER STICKS INTO THE PICTURE FRAME BORDER SO THAT WILL STAND A RAFT ON TO THE BASE OF OUR PUPPET STAGE THEATER
gKedb-Yc-zI_1 ANOTHER WAY TO USE CALM NOTCHES FOR JUMPS IS TO HAVE AGAIN ON THE TRAIL I'M MEGAN HAVE AND JUMP UP ON ROCKS AND THEN JUMP UP ON A WIDE VENTS IF YOUR DOG IS NIMBLE ENOUGH AND IT DOES HAVE SOME FUN WITH THAT
gKedb-Yc-zI_2 IT WORKS THEIR BRAIN AS WELL AS THEIR BODIES AND IT INCREASES UPON BETWEEN YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE WORKING TOGETHER
gKedb-Yc-zI_3 SO FOR KARMA WITH ANY IS THIS THAT INSTEAD OF A BOLDER SENSE THERE'S NOT ANY IN THE YARD
gKedb-Yc-zI_7 AS A SEMI WAS MAKING AN OBSTACLE COURSE
gKedb-Yc-zI_8 I'M HAVING A GAP ON THE BOLDER
gKedb-Yc-zI_9 AND BACKING UP HEAVIER COME AGAIN
gKedb-Yc-zI_10 ALMOST ON NOT NECESSARILY HAVING A TURN AROUND TO ME IN THIS VERSION OF CALM BUT I AM EXPECTING HER TO COME STRAIGHT TO ME AND THE STICK
gt0Y5ZSZ7Cs_1 AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT FLYING HAS BEEN SHOWN IS LAY THE IS THAT THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN OUR MOTION HOW AND A PHYSICAL HOW I'M
gt0Y5ZSZ7Cs_2 FOR EXAMPLE THE ADD THEY UNIVERSE IS A COUPLE REASON CANVAS THAT HEAT FROM THAT I AM SHOWED THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE LONELY TEN HAVE HIGH OR LOW HI HAT AND HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF THE FIREFLY A FLIGHT OF A CHEMICALS THAT WOULD ROOTS ARE <UNK> AND IT'S KIND OF TURNING THE IN OVERTURN THEY FOUND THAT THEY THAT CAN CAUSE INFLAMMATION BODY INKING KICKING CONTRIBUTE TO HOLD RANGE OF UP DISORDERS
gt0Y5ZSZ7Cs_3 SO WITH ENERGY THAT SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS LONELINESS COME TO HAVE THAT AREN'T <UNK> CONNECTION HALF AND HALF AND HALF
gt0Y5ZSZ7Cs_4 SO THE IDEA HERE IS I PROBABLY IS A GOOD IDEA I CEO HALF <UNK> HALF OF ON COMPANION JET AND IT OUT OF THE REASONS THAT A FISH OF A IT AT THE HALF THE HUMAN PENNINGTON FAIRLY THERE'S ALSO BEEN VERY POSITIVE HEALTH BENEFITS OF HAVING A PATH FOR EXAMPLE
gt0Y5ZSZ7Cs_5 BUT THE IDEA IS THAT I'M HAVING COMPANIONSHIP INFRINGED IN A PERSON'S LIFE IS AROUND IN POURING FOR INJURED OVERALL HEALTH OF YOUR PHYSICAL BODY
HdyinId6Uzs_1 A GREAT VARIATION OF THE CAT KICK FLIP IS TO LEARN THE KNOWLEDGE VARIATION
HdyinId6Uzs_2 NOT A HALF THAT KICK THAT IS WHEN YOU ARE HIGH IN AN OLLIE POSITION THE OLLIE ONE EIGHTY THREAT FRONTSIDE AND LAND FAKIE AND ROLLING
HdyinId6Uzs_3 AND TURN THAT INTO FADES ROOM
HdyinId6Uzs_4 THE <UNK> FRONTSIDE WITH THE E FLAT IS TO APPLY OR YOU COULD GET WOULD HAVE AN OLLIE WITH EIGHTIES PLENTY COMFORTABLY
HdyinId6Uzs_5 AND THEN COME BEHIND THE NOLLIE FLIP AND THE NOLLIE ONE EIGHTY TOGETHER
HdyinId6Uzs_6 SO THE DOG WOULD A FOOT IS LIKE THIS
HdyinId6Uzs_7 SET UP FOR THE FOOT IN AN OLLIE POSITION EXCEPT IT'S ON THE WORDS THAT ISN'T ABLE TO GET MAXIMUM ABILITY IS AN OLLIE AND FIGHT
HdyinId6Uzs_8 YOUR BACK FOOT IS IN THE PLACE THE MIDDLE OF THE WORD WITH IT'S HELD KATA SLIGHTLY OUT
HdyinId6Uzs_9 AND WHICH IT AND IT WAS FIFTH THAT WAS THOUGHTS AND CONTINUE UP THE WORD AND FLIP THE FOURTH ONE EIGHTY IF CUT AT <UNK> AND IN THE FAKIE POSITION
HdyinId6Uzs_10 WE'RE ALSO ILANA KIND HAVE AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE HALF CAB FLAT BECAUSE IT A LOT OF ABLE TO KNOW HOW TO FLAT AND IT'S FIGHTING IS REQUIRED FOR THE STRENGTH
HdyinId6Uzs_11 AND THAT WHICH I DO IS YOU TAKE THAT TRICK AND IMAGINE IT BACKWARDS AND THEN YOU'RE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT AND ONLY WHEN A TEETH

gt8bTw8IUYU_1 I'M FROM BIKES THAT DON'T HAVE WHIP RELEASES IT BASICALLY LOOKS LIKE THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS TO OUR LEVER IT'S JUST OF OLD THE BOLT IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LEFT SIDE LIKE THIS ONE IS JUST AS LEVER ON THE OTHER SIDE
gt8bTw8IUYU_2 BUT WE WOULD SET A TOOL IN THERE AND WE WOULD UP LOWER OF RAISE THE SEAT HEIGHT
gt8bTw8IUYU_3 SO I'M IS A <UNK> FOUR MILLIMETER WRENCH AND GOING TO LOOSEN IT UNTIL I CAN ADJUST THE SEAT HEIGHT AND THERE WE GO
gt8bTw8IUYU_4 SO FINDING THE RIGHT SEAT HEIGHT IS ANOTHER MANNER AND IRON
gt8bTw8IUYU_5 WHAT I LIKE TO DO IF AS IS THE RULE OF THUMB LIKE THAT FIND SOMETHING TO LEAN AGAINST THE BACK ON THE BITE AND WHEN YOU'RE WEARING THE SHORTS OR PANTS THAT RIGHT IN THE SHOES THE RIND AN ANATOMY THE RIGHT OF THESE PANTS OR SHOES
gt8bTw8IUYU_6 WHAT I DO IS I'M LOOK FOR THE APPROPRIATE KNEE ANGLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PADDLE STROKE WHICH IS ABOUT THE ANGLE THAT I HAVE HERE WITH OTHER TWENTY TWENTY FIVE DEGREE ANGLE
gt8bTw8IUYU_7 I COULD PROBABLY LOWER MY SEE A LITTLE BIT BUT WHEN YOU LOWERS TO LAUNCH YOU END UP HAVING A FREE AND COME FOR RIDING CONDITION
gt8bTw8IUYU_8 IT'S NOT A SUFFICIENT FOR HER CHINESE ON GOOD STUFF
gt8bTw8IUYU_9 SEE TOO HIGH AND ALSO NOT FISH AND ALSO GREAT FOR INJURY
gt8bTw8IUYU_10 THE BEST WAY TO MEASURE SEAT HEIGHT IS THE TAPE MEASURE IF MEASURING IT CONSISTENTLY FROM THE CENTER OF THE BOTTOM BRACKET WHICH IS THAT HOLE RIGHT THERE TO THE CENTER THE SEAT TUBE
gt8bTw8IUYU_11 I LIKE TO MEASURE IT STARTING AT THE TEN MILLIMETER MARKS IS ONE THAT UP OVER THE CENTER OF THE BOLT AND THEN UP HITTING THE CENTER OF THE SADDLE THEN
gt8bTw8IUYU_12 LOOKS LIKE I SET MY FEET RIGHT IS BY GUESSING THERE AND I LIKE TO RUN A SEVENTY THREE AND A QUARTER OF SEVEN THREE POINT TO FIVE MILLIMETER SEAT HEIGHT AND THAT'S THE THAT WE GOT
gt8bTw8IUYU_13 SO DON'T ENERGY TO HIV OHM DRIVER QUARTER REMEMBER WHITENER MEASUREMENTS ARE IN CASE YOU FINESSE FOR THINGS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR SEAT NICE AND LEVEL AND GET OUT THERE AND HAVE A DRIVE

h7qrdtKscoQ_5 WOULD EVER YOU DOING WHEN YOU'RE WITH YOUR CANCER MAN MAKE SURE YOU'RE FINDING A WAY TO INDULGE IN HIS WANTS AND HIS KNEES
h7qrdtKscoQ_6 OF COURSE THAT WORKS WELL WITH NO SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT A CATCHER CANCER MAN MAKE HIM THE MOST FABULOUS DISH THAT YOU CAN COAT AND YOU'LL FIND THAT ONCE HE'S AFTER YOUR TABLE HE WON'T LEE

Hk5WNr-RFE8_1 I LIKE PAYNE OWNER ACADEMY FOR THE MARTIAL ARTS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE ON THE TOPIC OF WHAT TO LOOK FOR MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOL
Hk5WNr-RFE8_2 I WOULD AVOID SCHOOLS WHERE THE CLASSES OR TWO CROWDING
Hk5WNr-RFE8_3 YOU GOT ON THE STUDENT TEACHER RATIO OF VERY HIGH
Hk5WNr-RFE8_4 THEY DON'T HAVE A OF A FLOOR WHERE THERE CAN BE SAFE IF THEY FALL DOWN
Hk5WNr-RFE8_5 THEY HAVE A MINUTE HIS
Hk5WNr-RFE8_6 IF YOU THEN THAT HIT A THAT HAS THE
Hk5WNr-RFE8_7 YOU HIT ENGINE
Hk5WNr-RFE8_8 <UNK> ADVENT OF ONE HUNDRED YEARS AND A HALF ON
Hk5WNr-RFE8_9 IF YOU'VE GOT VERY YOUNG INSTRUCTORS OF IF YOU'VE GOT INSTRUCTORS YOU'VE GOT TEENAGE OF STUDENTS REMEDIES WHAT'S IN GREEN BUILD LEADING THE CLASS AND DEADLY AVOID THAT
Hk5WNr-RFE8_10 AND WE WORK ARE IN THE
Hk5WNr-RFE8_11 NEXT I KNOW THERE'S SCHOOLS LIFE LIKE THAT WITH A FITTED AFTER SCHOOL AGAIN LIKE FIFTY OR SIXTY SEVENTY CAVING ONE CLASS
Hk5WNr-RFE8_12 AND HAVE YOU REALLY NEED TO HELP HIM TO EAT
hF48m-fxAGo_1 SO THE FIRST THAT DURING ON THE WHEEL IS THE CENTER THE CLAY
hF48m-fxAGo_2 FIRST YOU WANT IT TAKE YOUR BALL OF CLAY AND WENT TO THE AS ROUNDS POSSIBLE THAT MAKES ENTERING MUCH EASIER TO AND THAT IT DOWN PRETTY HARD LIGHT ON THINNER THE WHEEL
hF48m-fxAGo_3 AND ANY OUT BUT A LOT OF TENSION IN FOR ME IN THE WAY THAT I THINNER IS THAT I LEAN ON THE FLASH IN WITH MY LEFT ARM AND THAT HE'S MY LEFT ARM FROM MOVING
hF48m-fxAGo_4 HAVE THAT ALL MY BODY WEIGHT INTO THAT UNATTENDED TRANSFER IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE HEEL OF MY LEFT HAND
hF48m-fxAGo_5 IF HE AND IT WOULD NOT GOING TO BE MOVING AND ENDS MY RIGHT HAND IT TO BE DOING THE WORK IN

Hfg1NJxVHog_2 WELCOME TO EXPERT VILLAGE
Hfg1NJxVHog_3 MY NAME IS WAYNE PETERSON AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE IMPORTANT BIRD AREAS PROGRAM FOR THE MASSACHUSETTS AUDUBON SOCIETY
Hfg1NJxVHog_4 TODAY WE'RE HERE AT THE DANIEL WEBSTER WILDLIFE SANCTUARY IN MARSHFIELD MASSACHUSETTS WHERE WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT BIRD IDENTIFICATION AND SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT AND ESSENTIAL TOOLS THAT ARE USEFUL TO GET ONE STARTED IN ISN'T CREDIBLY INTERESTING PASTIME
Hfg1NJxVHog_5 ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT BIRD IDENTIFICATION IS TO REMEMBER WHERE YOUR BIRDIE
Hfg1NJxVHog_6 WHAT'S THE HABITAT SPECIFICALLY IN THE LOCATION WHERE YOU'RE SPENDING TIME
Hfg1NJxVHog_7 FARSON WOODLANDS ARE CERTAINLY ONE OF OUR MORE FAMILIAR HABITATS AN OF CROSS NORTH AMERICA REPRESENT ONE OF THE MAJOR ECOSYSTEM TIGHTS
Hfg1NJxVHog_8 ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF BURNING IN FARCE IS THE FACT THAT THERE IS A LOT OF FOLIAGE AND OFTEN UNDERCOVER THAT CAN NOT MAKE OBSERVING BIRDS MORE DIFFICULT
Hfg1NJxVHog_9 AND THE FACT THAT IN MANY CASES BIRDS ARE OVER YOUR HEAD
Hfg1NJxVHog_10 YOU MAY HAVE TO BE LOOKING UP
Hfg1NJxVHog_11 AND YOU HAVE THE PROBLEM OF BACK LIGHTING AND SO FORTH MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT IN MANY CASES TO SEE THE BIRDS
Hfg1NJxVHog_12 SO BIRD VOCALIZATION IS AND SOUNDS LIKE WE DISCUSSED EARLIER CAN OFTEN BE VERY USEFUL
Hfg1NJxVHog_13 BUT SOME OF THE BIRDS THAT ARE QUITE TYPICAL OF FORESTED SITUATIONS I INCLUDE FIRST OF ALL CANOPY SPECIES BIRDS THAT LIKE TO SPEND THEIR TIME HIGH IN THE TREES
Hfg1NJxVHog_14 THESE WOULD BE THINGS LIKE ROWS RESTED GROSBEAKS SPOUT HANDERS RED IBERIA'S FOR EXAMPLE LOTS OF A WARBLERS
Hfg1NJxVHog_15 THEN THERE ARE SPECIES THAT SORT OF OCCUR AT MID STORY
Hfg1NJxVHog_16 WE MENTIONED THE WOOD THRUSH EARLIER AS BEING A SPECIES THAT OFTEN LIKES TO SING FROM SO THE MID STORY IN THE FOURTH CANOPY SITUATION
Hfg1NJxVHog_17 SOME OF THE FLY CATCHER'S ARE OFTEN FOUND OUT AT NEED LEVELED ADDED IN HIGH IN THE TREES
Hfg1NJxVHog_18 AND THEN THEY'RE BIRDS THAT ACTUALLY OCCUR DOWN ON THE FOREST FLOOR OR IN THE UNDER GROWTH
Hfg1NJxVHog_19 AND THE <UNK> WARBLER FOR EXAMPLE LIKE THE OVEN BIRD THAT NAST'S ON THE GROUND WOULD BE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A SPECIES THAT IT WOULD BE A TYPICAL SORT OF FOREST FLOOR HOT DWELLER
Hfg1NJxVHog_20 SO IN BIRDING IN THESE HABITATS IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE WATCHING FOR MOVEMENT I AT ALL LEVELS TO MOVE QUIETLY TO WEAR CLOTHING THAT IS RELATIVELY OF UNOBTRUSIVE SO YOU WON'T START OF THE BIRDS AND TO BE PARTICULARLY VIGILANT FOUR SOUNDS THAT WILL PERHAPS LEAD YOU TO THE THE BIRD OR IN SOME CASES IF YOU RECOGNIZE THE VOCALIZATION WILL ACTUALLY TELL YOU WHAT IT IS
Hfg1NJxVHog_21 BUT THESE CAN BE VERY RICH AND PRODUCTIVE HABITATS IT ALMOST ALL TIMES OF THE YEAR
Hfg1NJxVHog_22 OF BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY BAST IN MOST EASILY BIRD SOMETIME IN MID SPRING TO EARLY SUMMER WHEN THERE IS LIKELY BE A LOT OF BIRD ACTIVITY AND SPECIFICALLY SONG THAT WILL LEAD YOU TO WEAR BIRDS MAYBE
GuBHuLTwVwE_1 HELLO MY NAME IS NICOLE VALENTINE AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE ONION SONGS YOU ABOUT HAUSEN CORNERING BURNT LEGGINGS ARE VERY HARDY
GuBHuLTwVwE_2 WE'RE GOING TO NOW TALK ABOUT HOW TO AND AGAIN BEING PASS

GuBHuLTwVwE_17 AGAIN THIS THING IS THAT A WINE UNTIL THE LAST PRESENT IS AGAIN
GuBHuLTwVwE_18 WHAT'S THE IRIS AND IS NOT THINK OF IS LIKE A GAME THEY ARE OUT
GuBHuLTwVwE_19 THIS IS A FUN GAME IN RIBBONS AND DATA AND ONE BACK HAND TO SHOES AND YOU BEING THE
GuBHuLTwVwE_20 IT CAN TEACH A LETTER N IS DOES THE CREATIVE

HDf07ZoVpoQ_20 MY NAME IS DANIEL KING
gDx4dELC820_1 THE MARINE ORGANISM WE'RE GOING TO IDENTIFY NOW IS THE SLENDER FILE FIT
gDx4dELC820_2 THE SLENDER FILE FISH IS ONE OF THE SMALLER FOR OF THE FILE FISH SPECIES
gDx4dELC820_3 THEY RANGE IN SIZE FROM TWO TO THREE AND A HALF INCHES IN LENGTH
gDx4dELC820_4 THEY HAVE A SLENDER ELONGATED HEAD WITH A VERY SMALL MILES
gDx4dELC820_5 AS WITH ALL WHILE FISH THE FIRST LINE OF THE DORSAL FIN IS MUCH LONGER THAN THE OTHERS AND CAN BE USED WHEN EXTENDED TO LOCK THE FISH INTO A SMALL LOOK IN THE REEF SO THAT THEY CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO REMOVE
gDx4dELC820_6 SLENDER FILE FISH ARE GENERALLY A SHADE OF BROWN EITHER A READY SHORE YELLOWISH BROWN TO GRAY ON THE TOP PART OF THEIR BODY AND THEN A LIGHTER COLOR ON THE BOTTOM HALF
gDx4dELC820_7 THEY ALSO FREQUENTLY HAVE PARTICULARLY GOOD MARKINGS OVER THEIR BODY WITH THOSE MARKINGS MAY NOT ALWAYS BE OBVIOUS
gDx4dELC820_8 IN FACT SLENDER FILE FISH CAN DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE COLORS TO BETTER BLEND IN WITH THEIR BACKGROUND
gDx4dELC820_9 SLENDER FILE FISH ALSO HAVE A LARGE EXTENDABLE BELLY APPENDAGE CALL THE DO LAP THAT USUALLY HAS A YELLOW BORDER ON THE TRAILING EDGE
gDx4dELC820_10 SLENDER FILE FISH ARE GENERALLY FOUND HIDING IN THE BRANCHES OF GORGONIAN IS
gDx4dELC820_11 THEY ARE QUITE SHOT I IN WILL SLOWLY MOVE EITHER DEEPER INTO THE GORGONIAN WHEN APPROACH BY DIVERS OR WILL MOVE SLOWLY AROUND THE BACK SIDE OF THE GORGONIAN BRANCH TO HIDE FROM THE OBSERVER
gDx4dELC820_12 SLENDER FILE FISH FEED ON ELTON INVERTEBRATES
gDx4dELC820_13 THEY'RE RELATIVELY ON COMMONLY FOUND IN THE WATERS AROUND FLORIDA THE BAHAMAS AND THE CARIBBEAN
gDx4dELC820_14 THEY CAN BE FOUND IN DEPTHS FROM TEN TO SIXTY FEET AND ARE GENERALLY FOUND A SOLITARY ANIMALS
gDx4dELC820_15 THAT'S THE SLENDER FILE THAT
gui9Jmr4hSU_1 SOME THEY'VE GOT OF INTO BROKEN TILES WHEN YOU DO NEXT
gui9Jmr4hSU_2 IT'S TIME TO START POSITION I'M ON HERE SUBSTRATE
gui9Jmr4hSU_3 THEY'RE COOL THING TO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU POSITIONING TILES
gui9Jmr4hSU_4 IF YOU HAVE A SHAPE OR ESSENTIAL FEATURE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ACCIDENT YOU NEED TO DO THAT SHAPE FIRST
gui9Jmr4hSU_5 FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE A HEART IN THE MIDDLE OR A SIGN YOU WANT TO START WITH THAT SHAPE IN TILE THAT WHOLE SHAPE AND THEN TILE THE BACKGROUND
gui9Jmr4hSU_6 IT JUST MAKES IT EASIER WAY
gui9Jmr4hSU_7 ONE OF THE NOT DOING IS BECAUSE IT HAS I'VE CHOSEN UNDECIDED THIS WOULD BE REALLY GOOD RANDOM PATTERN
gui9Jmr4hSU_8 SO I'M HAS PUT DOWN A FEW PIECES IN A RANDOM THING INTAGLIO WHOA I CONSIDER WHEN I PLACE MY TILES
gui9Jmr4hSU_9 FIRST OF ALL YOU DON'T WANT POSITION ALL OF YOUR TILES BEFORE CERTAIN TO GLUE DOWN BECAUSE ONCE YOU START GLUING THEY'LL MOVE JUST A LITTLE BIT AND THEN IT'S NOT BENEFIT ANYMORE
gui9Jmr4hSU_10 SEE ONE JUST POSITION IF YOU WOULD A TIME AND THEN GLUE THEM DOWN
gui9Jmr4hSU_11 THINGS I THINK ABOUT WHEN I POSITION MY TILES IS STARTING WITH CORNERS
gui9Jmr4hSU_12 IT'S NICE TO PUT A CORNER TO CORNER THAT WAY YOU GET A VERY NICE CLEAN EDGE
gui9Jmr4hSU_13 OTHER THINGS TO THINK ABOUT ARE SHEET AND COLOR
gui9Jmr4hSU_14 I HAVE ONE PATTERN HERE ANOTHER PATTERN HERE MAYBE I NEED EACH A SOLID COLOR HERE
gui9Jmr4hSU_15 YOU CAN ALSO THINK ABOUT GROUT LINES
gui9Jmr4hSU_16 I REALLY LIKE HAVING UNIFORM GROUT LINES WHICH MEANS A QUARTER OF AN INCH OF GROUT BETWEEN EVERY SINGLE PIECE
gui9Jmr4hSU_17 SOME PEOPLE DON'T HERE THOUGH TO HAVE BIGGER GROUT LINES AND SMALLER GROUT LINES YOU CAN MAKE OF YOUR MIND WHAT LOOKS BEST FOR YOU
gui9Jmr4hSU_18 ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER IS THAT YOU DON'T WANT IT JUST PLEASE PIECES ANYWHERE AND THEN TRY AND FILL IN THE EMPTY SPACES
gui9Jmr4hSU_19 BECAUSE WHAT CAN HAPPEN IS IT IN A PLACE YOURSELF INTO A CORNER WHERE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO FIT ANY PIECE IN SOME WE'RE AWKWARD SPACE
gui9Jmr4hSU_20 ALTHOUGH THAT HAPPENS YOU CAN ALWAYS GO THAT'S YOUR NECK BIRDS AND IT A LITTLE PIECE BENEFIT RIGHT IN THE SPACE AS NEEDED
heHbgPxMsKQ_1 THE FIRST THING WE'LL TALK ABOUT TODAY FOR YOU TOO DEEP INTO A HOT DIE IN CARE AND THINGS LIKE THAT FOR THE CENTIPEDE A RED DISCUSS HOW TO MAKE A OF A GOOD ENCLOSURE VICINITY
heHbgPxMsKQ_2 ON ONE THAT'S ESPECIALLY OPTICS KEEPER
heHbgPxMsKQ_3 THAT'S REALLY OUT WITH OUR ME CONCERNS YEARS CREATING A CLOSURE THAT HE CAN GET OUT
heHbgPxMsKQ_4 SO PARTIALLY WHAT I LIKE TO USE LIKE THESE JARS OF SOME TYPE OR ANOTHER
heHbgPxMsKQ_5 I WANT TO LIKE THE GLASS TRUNKS ALONG PREFERABLY
heHbgPxMsKQ_6 YOU CAN ALSO USE PLASTIC OVERLAY SNAP LID
heHbgPxMsKQ_7 LEVER DISEASES IN AS A VERY SECURELY
heHbgPxMsKQ_8 THE REASON I LIKE THE TIGHTER JARS IT BECAUSE IT IS SCREW TOP LID A THICK IT'S NOT A COME OFF ON ACCIDENT
heHbgPxMsKQ_9 ONCE IT'S ON IT'S ON
heHbgPxMsKQ_10 HI I'M TIM SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT <UNK> KICKS
heHbgPxMsKQ_11 THAT IS IT THAT IS A NEW AVOID SO
heHbgPxMsKQ_12 YOU CAN BUY THIS AT ANY ODD YELL SUPERMARKET OR OR ARE PROBABLY ANY UM CRAFT STORES WELL
heHbgPxMsKQ_13 IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A LARGE OF MASON JAR LIKE OBJECT OF SOME SORT
heHbgPxMsKQ_14 SOME PEOPLE USE TOP WEARS IN THAT ARE ACTUALLY AWAY FROM THE PLASTIC
heHbgPxMsKQ_15 SO TO DO WITH THAT
heHbgPxMsKQ_16 IN WE'RE STAR OF A DECK AND THIS SESSION RUNNING MORE THAN FIVE OR SIX BOX
heHbgPxMsKQ_17 BUT OF COURSE IN ORDER TO MAKE A USEFUL FOR US OF THERE'S AND TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF MODIFICATION TO GET WE'RE READY TO BE
heHbgPxMsKQ_18 NOW A WHOLE LOT BUT THE <UNK> JUST A LITTLE BIT AND REDO THAT A HIGH IN NEXT YEAR
GgHxdyX3sqI_1 SO ALTHOUGH I DON'T LIKE GLOCK <UNK> FOR OVERLY FAKE LAND OR FISH CHATTER IF YOU DO IT TO THICKEN IT A LITTLE BIT
GgHxdyX3sqI_2 AND WHAT WE'RE THAT USES JUST REGULAR OLD ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR
GgHxdyX3sqI_3 I WOULDN'T USE WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR IF FIVE LEAST UNLEASHED I PREFER ON LEACH BUT IT REALLY DOES MAKE THEM AS OF DIFFERENCE ALREADY TO DO IS TO SPRINKLE THAT SENF TO THE ONIONS AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO MAKE THAT BACON FAT AND THIS FLOWER CORE
GgHxdyX3sqI_4 I MIGHT USE ABOUT THREE AND A HALF ALMOST FOR TABLE TO TOUGH OF FLOUR IF NOW OVER IN A DO IS SIMPLY SPOOF JUST HOOK IT
GgHxdyX3sqI_5 AND I'M A TURN OF THE HEAT DOWN A LITTLE BIT
GgHxdyX3sqI_6 ONE THING ABOUT FLOUR IS THAT IF YOU DON'T COOK IT HAS THE INTERVIEW OF HE'S THE FEEL TO IT
GgHxdyX3sqI_7 SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT COOK IT FOR AN CLIFF YOU USING FIFTY REUSING MODERN YOU'RE MAKING A REED ONE IT'S THAT SMELL OF THAT LIGHT SHORT RED COOKIES AND THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW IN THE FLOWER FROM THE FLOWERS DONE
GgHxdyX3sqI_8 BUT IN THIS CASE BECAUSE WE THAT THAT BACON FAT IN THERE REALLY JUST IN A QUICK OF TWO OR THREE MINUTES KEEP STIRRING IT HAS I DON'T WANT TO BURN IT IT OEHLERT FOR HAVE IT TAKE ANY COLOR CLICK AND A LITTLE BIT OF COLOR FROM OUR BACON TO BEGIN WITH AND LIKE MUCH OTHER THESE WHY THE CANDY
GgHxdyX3sqI_9 AND THE WE'RE REALLY DISCOMFORT THE FLOUR LITTLE THAT TAKE AWAY SOME OF THAT TASTINESS
GgHxdyX3sqI_10 OKAY SO WELL THAT'S COOKING OIL TOP TO LIVE ABOUT THE NEXT PART OF THE LIQUID
GgHxdyX3sqI_11 NOW OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE CLEAN AND IN THIS CASE WE'RE MENUS NO BECAUSE I LIKE TO BE A LITTLE THINNER
GgHxdyX3sqI_12 BUT THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT LIQUIDS YOU CAN USE
GgHxdyX3sqI_13 IF YOU ARE NOT ALLERGIC THE SHELL FISH ON WITH A ABSOLUTELY USE CLAM JUICE AND CLAM JUICES QUITE EXPENSIVE IT'S EASY TO FIND IT'S ALWAYS THE IN AND AROUND THE TUNAFISH AN A DECK AND A THING IS SUPER MARKET AND THAT ONE WHO CLEAN BRINE EASY FLAVOR
GgHxdyX3sqI_14 IF YOU DON'T HAVE IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE USING PLANTERS YOU DON'T HAVE IT WERE IN FACT IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO SHELLFISH THEY HAVEN'T USES CHICKEN STOCK NOW
GgHxdyX3sqI_15 THE THING ABOUT CHICKEN STOCK IS THE VERY NEUTRAL STOCK SO ALWAYS TAKE ON WHATEVER FLAVOR THAT YOU END UP AND ONCE WE PUT THE FISH IN THAT CHICKEN FLAVOR WILL REALLY GO AWAY
GgHxdyX3sqI_16 OBVIOUSLY IF NOT I AM AND YOU HAVE FISH EVEN HAVE A MORE OCEAN SWEET FLAVOR BUT THE CHICKEN STOCK REALLY IS QUITE ACCEPTABLE AS WELL
GgHxdyX3sqI_17 I TEND TO USE A LOW SODIUM CHICKEN STOCK BUT THAT'S BECAUSE ON HADSALL TO BE CAREFUL MYSELF IN TERMS OF HOW THE SEASONINGS
GgHxdyX3sqI_18 SO OUR NEXT THAT IS TO ADD THE FLAVORING LIQUID IN THIS CASE ON EASE PLANTINGS
GgHxdyX3sqI_19 I THINK FOR THIS BATTER PROBABLY JUST CANOES ABOUT SIXTEEN OUNCES OF COUNTERS
GgHxdyX3sqI_20 OUR FLOWERS HOOKED AND IF YOU CAN SMELL IT IT'S NOT A LITTLE BIT LIKE FIFTH AND THEY CAN COOK THESE IF YOU WERE THE WHOLE OFF AND TO HAVE A TURN OUR FEET DOWN BECAUSE AND I MAKE SURE IF THAT OUR FLOWER AND OUR LIQUID RELIEF INCORPORATED
GgHxdyX3sqI_21 THUMB WANT NICE AND SMOOTH NO NO LUMPS
GgHxdyX3sqI_22 WE GOT EIGHT OUNCES IT ON AND THE SECOND BALL AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NICE AND SMOOTH
GgHxdyX3sqI_23 YOU CAN SEE THAT THE FLOWER AND THE LIQUID HAVE COME TOGETHER SO IT'S NO LONGER THAT REALLY JUST TAKES A LITTLE THE STIRRING IN NOTHING TOO FANCY
GgHxdyX3sqI_24 NOW WE GOT IT INTO AN WITH IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE THIS TO NOW WHERE YOU CAN SEE THAT ARE BUILDING BLOCKS ARE GETTING THEIR AND WORK AND WAIT FOR THAT TO COME UP JUST A SMALL SIMMER IN THEM OR TO GO TO THE NEXT STEP

gigW20f1Pec_1 IN THIS CLIP WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT A FEW MISTAKES THE BEGINNING CONDUCTORS MIGHT MAKE
gigW20f1Pec_2 ON SO THE FIRST IS I KEEPING OUR KNOT
gigW20f1Pec_3 YOU WANNA KEEP BOTH ARMS OUT YOU DON'T WANT HIM BACK HERE AND YOU KNOW YOU WANT THEM VISIBLE AND OUT
gigW20f1Pec_4 AND SO YOU WANT THEM OUT HERE SO THAT THE WHOLE ORCHESTRA CAN SEE THEM AND A IN OTHERS MOOSA NEW NO GOING BACK HERE IT IS REALLY CONFUSING IS REALLY HARD TO FALL A CONDUCTOR THAT THAT IS CONDUCTING BACK HERE
gigW20f1Pec_5 AND SOME CONDUCTORS WILL DO IT BUT IT'S NOT AN OUTSIDE AND PRACTICE TO GET INTO
gigW20f1Pec_6 SECOND THING IS ON A LOT TIMES WHEN YOUR EAR BEATING TIME YOU DON'T WANT YOUR ELBOW TO GET IN THE WAY
gigW20f1Pec_7 A LOT OF TIMES A BEGINNING CONDUCTORS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU START GETTING TIME SLOPPY WITH WITH YOUR PATTERN AT YOUR ELBOW IF YOU NOTICE IS AND MY ELBOWS ACTUALLY MOVING BACK AND SAY AT TELLING THE ORCHESTRA DIFFERENT TIME THAN THE TIP OF MY THE TIME
gigW20f1Pec_8 SO IT IS ALMOST LIKE A A WAVE EFFECT AND IT'S VERY CONFUSING BECAUSE THE OF THE CHOSEN THE BASES AND THIS SIDE MIGHT GET ONE OF WHEN YOU KNOW ONE THING IN THE THINK MY ELBOWS YOU KNOW THE FOLLOWING MY ELBOW MOST BECAUSE FROM YOUR FROM THAT ANGLE IT LOOKS CONFUSING TO THE ORCHESTRA
gigW20f1Pec_9 AND IN THE REST OF THE YOU KNOW PEOPLE I CAN SEE MY ELBOW ARE FALLING THE TO THE BATON SO GIVES THEM ALMOST LIKE A AN ECHO EFFECT
gigW20f1Pec_10 THEY'RE NOT SAYING THE SAME TIME
gigW20f1Pec_11 THE NEXT THING IS YOU WHAT YOU ALWAYS WANT TO KEEP YOUR YOUR HANDS IN OF LEAD A YUM FORMAL HIV GRACEFUL SORT OF I'M POSITION
gigW20f1Pec_12 NEVER WANT SPREAD FINGERS LIKE THAT
gigW20f1Pec_13 YOU ALWAYS WANT LIKE THE TWO FINGERS THE BEST IS NEW TWO FINGERS TOGETHER AND YOU CAN PHRASE LIKE THAT
gigW20f1Pec_14 YOU CAN DO CUSHION GOES WITH WITH HER HAND CUPS LIKE THAT AND THEN CUT DOWN FOR A DAY CRESCENDO ON
gigW20f1Pec_15 THE NEXT THING IS POSTURE
gigW20f1Pec_16 YOU ALWAYS WANT GOOD POSTURE AND YOU DON'T YOU DON'T YOU DON'T EVER WANT A SLOUCH NEVER ON AND YOU NOW HOW SETS AND LIKE THAT
gigW20f1Pec_17 THE ORCHESTRA IS GET A PLAY LIGHT YOU TELL THEM TO PLAY
gigW20f1Pec_18 AND IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY ON AND HOW YOUR HANDS LOOK
gigW20f1Pec_19 THE ABOUT HALF A CONFIDENT UP THERE AND I'M ESPECIALLY YOUNGER ON LESSON AND EXPERIENCE ORCHESTRAS WILL FIND IT WILL SEE CONDUCTOR THAT ISN'T AS EXPERIENCE OR CONFIDENT AND THEY WILL PICK UP ON THAT EITHER SUBCONSCIOUSLY OR CONSCIOUSLY AND THEY WILL PLAY ACCORDINGLY
gigW20f1Pec_20 SO YOU NEVER YOU NEVER ONCE LAUBSCHER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT
gigW20f1Pec_21 FACIAL EXPRESSION IS IMPORTANT IF YOU PLANT YOU KNOW ON PLAYING A PIECE OR IS A SECTION THAT'S RENA SOMBER MORE SAD DON'T YOU KNOW DON'T BE SMILING DON'T BE GROOVY UP ON THE PODIUM
gigW20f1Pec_22 IN YOUR REFLECT THE MUSIC IN YOUR FACE AND I'VE JUST YOU KNOW DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T FIT THE MUSIC
gigW20f1Pec_23 BECAUSE THERE WATCHING YOUR FACE AND THEY ARE LOOKING FOR WHEN YOU'RE FEELING IN THE MUSIC

Gt5ZwlPxtp8_1 IT'S AN HOUR AND TALK ABOUT HOW WE PUT THE TUNER COVERS ON THE GUITAR
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_2 IT'S A TRICKY PROCESS BECAUSE THEY DON'T SCREW ONE BUT THEY NEED A FIRM PUSHING INTO PLACE
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_3 WELL WE ALREADY HAVE OUR TUNERS ON A GUITAR
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_4 SO WE NEED TO DO IS ME TO FIND A WAY TO GET OVER THIS TUNER THEN PUSH DOWN ON THIS TUNER COVER AND REALLY GET IT IN PLACE FIRM
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_5 BECAUSE THE FURNACE OF THIS TUNER COVER IS HUMAN DETERMINE HOW FURMARK TUNERS HOLDING PLEASE RESUME DETERMINED ALL FIRM OUR STRING IS HELD OF THE GUITAR WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_6 SO USUALLY DO
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_7 AND PUT IT DOWN INTO PLACE IT'S GOT A LOT OF A LOT OF FRICTION ON RIGHT THERE BECAUSE ME AND MAKE IT TIGHT
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_8 GET A PLASTIC PIECE THEY CAN FIT OVER IT SO IT OUT OF READING METAL OR IN THE GYM AND IN IN THE PLACE
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_9 IT'S GOOD GENTLY KAPUT DOWN TO THE OF USING OUR PLASTIC PIECE OF THEM AND GETTING ALL THE SIDES
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_10 AND THE CAN
Gt5ZwlPxtp8_11 YOU TESTER TO RECOVER WE HAVEN'T AFFECTED THE ONE SO LOOKING GOOD
guUkTXUwAAk_1 HI I'M TY BROWN WITH DOG BEHAVIOR ON LINE DOT COM TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO TRAIN A DOG
guUkTXUwAAk_2 THE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW IS HOW TO TRAIN A DOG TO GO SWIMMING
guUkTXUwAAk_3 NOW A LOT OF DOGS WILL MATCH ELECTRICAL SWIMMING BUT A LOT OF DOGS NEED TO LEARN HOW TO BE TAUGHT
guUkTXUwAAk_4 THEY HAVE TO BE TAUGHT GOES FROM IF AND SO THERE'S A COUPLE KEY ASPECTS IN A COUPLE KEY POINTS OF HOW TO TEACH YOUR DOG TO GO SWIMMING
guUkTXUwAAk_5 NOW THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TEACH YOUR DOG WHERE THE ENTRIES IN EXITS ARE WHETHER IT BE A RIVER OF HONDA STREAM OR A POOL THE DOG NEEDS KNOW HOW TO GET IN SAFELY AND HOW TO GET OUT SAFELY
guUkTXUwAAk_6 DOGS THAT STRUGGLE WITH SWIMMING OFTEN STRUGGLE BECAUSE THEY'RE NERVOUS ABOUT HOW TO GET OUT AND SO THE FIRST THING TO DO IS SHOW THAT DOG HOW TO GET OUT OF A POOL HOW TO GET OUT OF THE STREAM OR WHEREVER HE IS THAT
guUkTXUwAAk_7 THE SECOND THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TRY TO USE MOTIVATION THE FISH THAT DOG TO SWIM
guUkTXUwAAk_8 SO MAYBE IF THE DOG LOVES UP A BALL FRO BALL OUT TO THE WATER
guUkTXUwAAk_9 SEE IF YOU GO OUT THERE TO GET IT WHEN HE GOES UP RAISING HEAVILY ALLOWED TO GET THAT BALL
guUkTXUwAAk_10 IF HE LOVES FOOD HAVE SOMEBODY OUT THERE IN THE WATER WITH SOME FOOD
guUkTXUwAAk_11 IF HE HAS A FAVORITE PERSON HAVE THAT PERSON GO OUT TO THE WATER IN ENTICE THAT DOG TO COME IN
guUkTXUwAAk_12 WHATEVER IT IS TRY TO USE MOTIVATION
guUkTXUwAAk_13 NOW THERE ARE THOSE DOGS THAT THAT NEED TO GO SWIMMING BUT DON'T REALLY HAVE MOTIVATION TO GET IN THE WATER AND SO FOR THOSE DOGS YOU CAN USE A LEASH TO HELP OBLIGE THEM IN THE WATER AND AGAIN SHOW THEM HOW TO GET OUT
guUkTXUwAAk_14 NOW MOST DOGS IF YOU CAN SHOW THEM TIME AND TIME AGAIN HOW TO GET IN THE WATER HOW TO GET OUT AND THAT WHILE THEY'RE IN THERE IT'S A LOT OF FUN THEY'RE GOING TO EVENTUALLY LEARN TO ENJOY SWIMMING
guUkTXUwAAk_15 SO IN ORDER TO TEACH YOUR DOG WHERE THE EDGE AND IT'S EXITS IN ENTRIES ARE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS USE A LEASH OFF AND USE A LEASH AS A TOOL FOR COMMUNICATION
guUkTXUwAAk_16 SO LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE FOR THIS LINE HERE IS THE WATER LINE IF NOT THAT ONE OF MY DOG AGO AND ROCK AGO SWIMMING
guUkTXUwAAk_17 I DIDN'T IN AND THE NEATLY GET HIM RIGHT BACK OUT
guUkTXUwAAk_18 SO THE HE KNOWS WHERE THE ENTRY IS WHERE THE EXIT ISN'T THAT HE KNOWS THAT HE CAN HAVE VICTORY GETTING OUT LIKE THAT FIN SO I WOULD DO THAT NUMEROUS TIMES IN ORDER FROM THE START FEELING COMFORTABLE EACH TIME ALONG AND GO OUT FURTHER INTO WATER
guUkTXUwAAk_19 ROCK LOCAL SWIMMING
guUkTXUwAAk_21 THE MONTH OF LOW
guUkTXUwAAk_22 GOOD BOY AND THAT'S A TEACHER DOG A SWIMMING

GVL2P2xm04k_2 NOW YOU CAN EITHER HAVE AN ASSORTMENT OF AGE GROUPS OR YOU CAN FOCUS ON ONE AGE GROOVE THAT IS THAT YOU AS A PATENT DIRECTOR
GVL2P2xm04k_3 IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO MULTIPLE AGE GROUPS YET TO CONSIDER THE CATEGORIES OF THE AGE GROUPS
GVL2P2xm04k_4 AND I'M CAN HELP YOU BREAK THEM UP ON

gNt29GDAGlc_1 I'M RICK TOBEY AND IN THIS SERIES WE'LL BE LEARNING HOW TO PLAY BLUES PROGRESSIONS AND AND LOSE ALL ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gNt29GDAGlc_2 NOW OF WHAT WE'VE LEARNED SO FAR WAS PLAYING ANY E BLUES PROGRESSION WITH OPEN COURTS HANDY THIN AND HIGH AND EVENLY
gNt29GDAGlc_3 <UNK> OPENING MEANING THAT THERE ARE OPEN STRINGS AND HOLDING IT THERE
gNt29GDAGlc_4 OUR IS ALSO WAY TO PLAY WHERE THERE ARE NO OPEN STRINGS THESE WOULD ARE CALLED MOVABLE CHORDS OR BARRE CHORDS AND AND THE REASON IS THAT YOU CAN THEN CHANGE THE KEY
gNt29GDAGlc_5 IF YOU GO TO PLAY A LITTLE RED RESTRING EVEN LAND OPEN
gNt29GDAGlc_6 BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO PLAY OF LITTLE RED ROOSTER IN THEM AND DIFFERENT TEA IT'S A D HOME RUN OUT OF <UNK> I'M WITH THE BOTTOM HORMONE WHOM HOME I DON'T HAVE WHOM HANRAHAN HONING BOOM <UNK> IN THE HOME

hK0nsZ0vWX0_1 ASSUMING OVER A STRAINER AND DOING THAT STRING IS WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR BOAT IS A VERY DANGEROUS THINK OF IT
hK0nsZ0vWX0_2 AND BECAUSE OF THAT WOULD NOT CAN BE DEMONSTRATING IT TODAY
hK0nsZ0vWX0_3 HOWEVER WE ALL IN IT SO LOOKING A LITTLE BIT OF IT READ ABOUT HOW TO DEAL THAT IF I'M WATCHING ME DO COME UP IN A SITUATION
hK0nsZ0vWX0_4 STRING IS THE WIND TREES OF GOING INTO THE RHYTHM AND A LOT OF WATER GOING POTS THEM
hK0nsZ0vWX0_5 JUST LIKE SOMETHING AS STRAIGHT OUT PASTA WITH THE LAW JOBS THAT OBJECTS GET STUCK ON THE WALL TO LOOSE THROUGH
hK0nsZ0vWX0_6 THIS IS WHY THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS THING WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR BOAT
hK0nsZ0vWX0_7 THE THING THAT YOU SHOULD TRY AND DO IS SWIM AS AGGRESSIVELY IS YOU CAN AROUND THE STRING UP TO AVOID IT CUSTOM ALMOST
hK0nsZ0vWX0_8 HOWEVER IF THE CONS AVOIDED THAN AGAIN ONCE IT IS SOMETHING THAT SEEMS A LITTLE STRANGE
hK0nsZ0vWX0_9 GET A NEW BATLEY AND SWIM AS AGGRESSIVELY AS YOU CAN TOWARDS A STRAINER
hK0nsZ0vWX0_10 AT WHICH POINT WE GET CLOSE TO REACH UP ROUTE THE STRING UP A WHOLE DSL OF UP SO THE STRING IS ON THE LOW WAIST
hK0nsZ0vWX0_11 AT THIS POINT ONE OF THE MOST OF THE CHEST OF THE TREE AND THEN WHEN I KICK OVER IT AND TRYING GET PASTA
hK0nsZ0vWX0_12 ROLL IT IS STABLE SIT IN WEIGHT MORE RESISTANCE
hK0nsZ0vWX0_13 WITH THE TWO DON'T GO ON TO THE STRAINER AND DON'T PUSH PEOPLE DOWN IT THE COOL ON A STRAINER BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LIMBS THE STICKING BELOW THE SURFACE TO CATCH SOMEONE
HFA_4HkuXqc_1 AN CARING FOR A HORSE IN UNSTABLE IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE STALLS THEY CLEAN AND DRY
HFA_4HkuXqc_2 WE DO THAT BY MAKING SURE THEIR CLEANED LEFT OUT AT LEAST ONCE DAILY AND THAT FRESH SAWDUST IS PUT IN
HFA_4HkuXqc_3 WE ALSO LIKE TO HEAT RUBBER MATS WHICH HELPS TO MAKE THE CLEANING PRESSES EASIER AND PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT FOR THE HORSE
HFA_4HkuXqc_4 IT ALSO AN OPTION THAT HAVE A STALL CARDS THAT YOUR HORSE IS ABLE TO STICK IT HAD OUT AND THE VENTILATION IS IMPROVED
HFA_4HkuXqc_5 WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE IT IS LIKE WITH ANY CARE OF THE HORSE THAT THERE'S FRESH WATER AND FOOD AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE DAY

h40qZA6CO14_10 I'M ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF TO TWO FEET OFF THE BOTTOM
h40qZA6CO14_11 I CAN FISH THAT AREA FOR A FEW MINUTES

GmZ1X1PsgDE_7 AND BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS ALL THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT YOU DJ IS THE DJ'S BASICALLY ONCE THAT THE HEAD OF THE GROUT AND BASICALLY THE IN THE HEADPHONES WHEN UP THE NECK SO I'LL BEFORE HE ACTUALLY BRINGS INHALING AND THERE'S THE VOLUME OF OUT HERE
GmZ1X1PsgDE_8 IT'S THAT FAMILIAR WITH THE PARTS OF THE G MIXER
GmZ1X1PsgDE_9 AND ANY DJ MIXER YOU CAN HAVE AGAIN WHICH IS TO SAY THE VOLUME COMING IN TO THE MIXER FROM THE TENT IT
GmZ1X1PsgDE_10 LASSO THAT HAVE A SECTION OF THE EQUALIZER LOW FREQUENCY NEED FREQUENCY IN HIGH FREQUENCY
GmZ1X1PsgDE_11 AND THEN YOU CAN HAVE A VOLUME FADER WHICH CONTROLS THE VALUE MANGOES OUT TO THE HOUSE AND THE HOUSE IS BASICALLY WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE'S LISTEN TO IT

gfhUMyYoBxM_1 ON HOW WHAT LATTER HERE ON IT THINNEST A FEW THINGS TO
gfhUMyYoBxM_2 AVOID INTO TO SHOW YOU HOW I LIKE A ALL OR ON A LADDER HOW OFTEN YOU FIND YOURSELF AND TIE CORNERS OFF
gfhUMyYoBxM_3 AS I HAVE THIS COGNITIVE SICK AND MOVE IT
gfhUMyYoBxM_4 BE MINDFUL OF WHAT'S AROUND TO TAKE A LOOK AROUND
gfhUMyYoBxM_5 AND I GET THIS LADDER FROM FROM HIM UP TO THIS ONE THE FAN FUNNY
gfhUMyYoBxM_6 ON AN OLD WOOD MIGHT BE IN MY WAY
gfhUMyYoBxM_7 FOR INSTANCE IN OUT SOMETIMES THERE'S TREES SOMETIMES IT'S HELPFUL LINES SO YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TAKE A LOOK UP OF AND SEE WHAT MIGHT BE AWAY
gfhUMyYoBxM_8 THIS IS PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD
gfhUMyYoBxM_9 IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TAKING OUT OR STRAIGHT UP TO THE TO THE BUILDING BUT OFTEN YOU OF PINE TREES IF AT OTHER OBSTACLES ABOUT YOU WHOEVER THINGS OF THE ROOF
gfhUMyYoBxM_10 YOU WON'T BE MINDFUL OF YOU WANT A NO OF WHAT'S UP ABOVE YOU BEFORE YOU JUST TAKE YOUR WET IT JUST INTERESTED PUT IN POSITION GET YOU MIGHT FIND <UNK> THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO DO IT WITHOUT DAMAGING SOMETHING
gfhUMyYoBxM_11 LIFTING WEIGHTS KALI <UNK>
gfhUMyYoBxM_12 I THINK OF WALKING AROUND WITH YOU THIS WAY IF VENT WITH PLANT THAT THE SETUP GLADDOCK FINE FIND IT HAS PLENTY TO THIRTY TO FOR THAT IS IS ONLY TWENTY FOUR FOOT MATTED WITH FIND THE LEVERAGE WHITE HI
gfhUMyYoBxM_13 IF THIS IT UP A HALF FILE AND OTHER THINGS A LOT OF FOR LADDERS TO KNOW WHICH WAY THE OF THE <UNK> AND THESE ARE THE VEHICLE DOWN THROUGH WILL DO THE ANGLE WANTS TO BE TOWARD THE GROUND IF NOT HALF OF THIS OF BASICALLY THIS IS THE WRONG WITH IT YOU TURN IT AROUND HER
gfhUMyYoBxM_14 I'VE WITH AND WHAT A DENTIST A AT THE HIGHLIGHT CAN LATCHES EASIER FOR ME

H6DHOeeDBdY_1 HI
H6DHOeeDBdY_2 THIS IS JOHN CARSTARPHEN FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
H6DHOeeDBdY_3 NOW WITH THAT SOME PROBLEMS LINING UP THE PHOTOGRAPHS OHM AS THEY WERE TAKEN ORIGINALLY IN POSER
H6DHOeeDBdY_4 SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS SOME I'VE TAKEN THE PHOTOGRAPHS BACK INTO PHOTO SHOP AND I'VE DONE A SIMPLE LINE UP USING THE GRADES IN PHOTO SHOP
H6DHOeeDBdY_5 AND TO DO THAT I'VE ISOLATED EACH FACE AND PUT THEM ON DIFFERENT LAYERS SO THAT'S ON THE TOP LAYER IS THE FRONT VIEW AND THE BOTTOM LAYERS THE SIDE VIEW
H6DHOeeDBdY_6 AND THEN IT'S JUST A MATTER OF LINING UP THE EYES AND THE OF THE MOUSE AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE
H6DHOeeDBdY_7 AND I COULD PROBABLY EVEN DO SOME SCALING OF ONE OF THESE PHOTOGRAPHS TO MAKE THEM LINED UP EVEN MORE
H6DHOeeDBdY_8 BUT ONCE THAT'S DONE <UNK> THEN I EXPORT EACH IMAGE EACH LAYER SEPARATELY IS A SEPARATE IMAGE AND AS J PEG FILE
H6DHOeeDBdY_9 NOW YOU'LL NOTICE THAT OFF TO THE SIDES HERE WE HAVE QUITE A BIT OF WHITE SPACE AND OF COURSE WE HAVE THE GREEN BACK AROUND
H6DHOeeDBdY_10 NOW WE CAN KNOCK OUT THE GREEN BACKGROUND IN PHOTO SHOP OR ANOTHER PROGRAM BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH THIS WHITE SPACES WE HAVE TO PAINT A ROUND THE IMAGE SO THAT WE'D UM HAVE THIS BLEND INTO A SKIN TONE
H6DHOeeDBdY_11 FOR INSTANCE IF I WERE TO SELECT THE PAINT BRUSH AND THE EYEDROPPER TOOL I PROBABLY WOULDN'T TAKE A SKIN TONE SOMEWHERE IN THERE AND THEN ON AT A NEW LAYER AND PERHAPS BEGIN PAINTING LIKE THIS
H6DHOeeDBdY_12 AND THEN USING BE UM BLUR TOOLS IN THE SMUDGE TOOLS I'D TRY TO BLEND THAT IN A LITTLE MORE SO THAT WHAT WE END UP WITH IS SOMETHING THAT LOOKS A LOT LIKE A TEXTURE MAP
H6DHOeeDBdY_13 IN OTHER WORDS YOU HAVE THE KEY FACIAL FEATURES APPARENT AND CLEAR SUCH AS THE EYES EYEBROWS NOSE MOUTH CHIN AND SOME OF THE UM CREASES IN THE FACE AND THE FRECKLES AND SO FORTH
H6DHOeeDBdY_14 WILL WANNA KEEP ALL THOSE DETAIL FEATURES BUT WE HAVE TO LOSE THE STUFF AROUND THE SIDE
GIzqSW-MQrQ_1 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FROST
GIzqSW-MQrQ_2 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT THE C AND THEN AFTER IS FROSTING
GIzqSW-MQrQ_3 IF UP AND WE ALSO ONE WATCH THE WEATHER SO THAT WE KNOW OUT OUR IF IT'S GOING TO RAINLEY ONE IT MAKE SURE THAT WE PLANT THE SEEDS A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE IT RAINS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO BE EITHER WATERING ALL A TIME
GIzqSW-MQrQ_4 THE SEEDS IF THEY'RE OUT IF YOU DESERVE THE WEATHER AND YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OF THE REINS AND THE SEEDS AFTER YOU PLAN ON IT SHOULD COME UP TWO OR THREE TO FOUR DAYS AFTER YOU PLAN ON AND THAT'S WHY YOU WANNA COORDINATE IT WITH THE WEATHER SO THAT THE ALL RAIN IT SOAKS A MAN AND AND THEY CAN HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF OF OAK STRONG GERMINATION
GIzqSW-MQrQ_5 ARMS THEY'RE FOR EACH TO WEATHER IS VERY IMPORTANT IN IN NOT COORDINATING IS I'LL DRAWING OF GLUE THE LADDER
g7r6pLpJAwQ_1 OKAY NOW WE HAVE OUR BLANCHED ASPARAGUS TIPS AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT THOSE ASIDE IN A BOWL AND ACTUALLY ANY TO EMPTY JUST FALL RIGHT NOW
g7r6pLpJAwQ_2 OR AT LEAST THREE USE MY HOLES A LOT OF THEIR CLEAN OUR USE THEM SO HIT OF A BLANCHED <UNK> STEPS AND OF THE OTHER FIVE OF MEANS THAT I THREW WHEN THEY'RE ALL DO THOSE LATER HOCKEY <UNK> LISTENING TO SOME BEAUTIFUL MUSIC
g7r6pLpJAwQ_3 SO THESE ARE THE TIP IS THEY'RE GOING IN THE SALAD <UNK> WITHOUT THE MALL OUT OF THERE YOU CAN DO THIS OVER THE SINK AS WELL THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT TO HAVE I SLAUGHTER PAY
g7r6pLpJAwQ_4 IN OUR NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO SLICE THE STOCKS IN THERE'S CLOSE TO THE SLICED AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH THICK END AND HERE'S A LITTLE WHEN YOU BUY ASPARAGUS SOMETIMES SOME OF THE LITTLE THAT WRINKLED YOU WANNA PERFECT YOU'D YOU WOULD I'M TAKE OFF THE HEART AND AND THROW THAT AWAY AND SAVE THE STOCK AND THEN I JUST LINE THEM UP LIKE THIS TO MAKE QUICK WORK
g7r6pLpJAwQ_5 BECAUSE AS YOU CAN SEE JUST DOING ONE AND A TIME IS IN SUCH A GREAT THING BUT YOU COULD SLIDE THEM A LOT AND DON'T GET READY TO CUT AND NOW I NEED TO GO GET MY CHEF KNIFE
g7r6pLpJAwQ_6 OKAY SO I'M GOING TO QUICKLY CUT THESE IF AN EIGHTH INCH ROUNDS IN THERE AND GET TOSSED RIGHT INTO THE SALAD YOU CAN SEE I'M USING THAT SAME ROCKING MOTION IF THAT I SHOWED YOU THE FLOOR
g7r6pLpJAwQ_7 EXCEPT THIS TIME I'M HOLDING ON TO THE ASPARAGUS NOT THE FRONT OF THE KNIFE AND I'M JUST CUTTING AND BETTER IT VERY THIN THOUGHTS FIFTH
g7r6pLpJAwQ_8 WHEN YOU GET TO THE END YOUR FINGERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ASPARAGUS SO IF YOU CAN'T GET TO THE LAST LITTLE LIMBS WITHOUT PUTTING A SELF PLEASE DON'T
g7r6pLpJAwQ_9 BUT THIS IS WHAT THEY SHOULD LOOK LIKE WHEN THEY'RE FINISHED AND I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE THESE FEW SMALL ENDS AND DO THEM AND INDIVIDUALLY BUT JUST SO THAT I WON'T INJURE MYSELF IN THE PROCESS
g7r6pLpJAwQ_10 OKAY THAT'S READY TO GO
gsbBRXcJhTA_1 IF YOUR LINE OUT SKATEBOARD AND FIRST THING YOU NEED TO LAND WITHOUT A PUSH
gsbBRXcJhTA_2 THE EASIEST WAY TO FIGURE THAT OUT IT'S HAVE FRIENDS IN BEHIND YOU AND PUSHING FORWARD WHICHEVER FOOT YOU STEP BOARD WITH HAS BEEN IN THE FRONT FOOT
gsbBRXcJhTA_3 I USUALLY STUFF FOR WITH MY RIGHT FOOT MEAN THAT I'LL RIDE GOOFY
gsbBRXcJhTA_4 WHICH IS <UNK> WITH YOUR LEFT FOOT IN THE BACK RIGHT FOOT IN THE FRONT
gsbBRXcJhTA_5 BUT SOME PEOPLE MAY RIDE REGULAR WHICH IS RIGHT FOOT IN THE BACK LEFT FOOT IN THE FRONT
gsbBRXcJhTA_6 AN IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN YOU PUSH IT IN YOUR FOOT IN THE DIRECTION THAT YOU WANT GO
gsbBRXcJhTA_7 IT'S PRETTY MUCH JUST A KICKING MOTION AGAINST THE HAND OF CONTROLLING IT FROM THAT POINT ON
gsbBRXcJhTA_8 AND LIKE I SAID THIS AND TURNING LASH AND THEY THINK FOUNDATION AND OF EVERYTHING IN SKATEBOARDING
gsbBRXcJhTA_9 AND YOU NEED TO BE TO PERFORM THE TRICK FILLING IN THE KEY THING IN THE REST OF THE SERIES
gsbBRXcJhTA_10 SO JUST KEEP IN MIND IN THE FRONT FOOT FORWARD OR WHEREVER YOU WANNA GO BECAUSE WE AND FOOT'S THE DIRECTION THE BOARDS AND SAND
H5AJOM7RRg0_1 AND THIS IS A DOUBLE PRUSAK KNOT
H5AJOM7RRg0_2 THE DOUBLE CRUISING KNOT IS BASICALLY JUST AN EXTRA BEND OVER YOUR REGULAR PRUSAK KNOT
H5AJOM7RRg0_3 NOW SHE RUMMIE EDGING SIT ON HERE
H5AJOM7RRg0_4 I HAVE MY PRUSAK ALREADY SET UP TO SHOW YOU
H5AJOM7RRg0_5 ANOTHER WRAPPED AROUND THIS HERE
H5AJOM7RRg0_6 NOW THIS IS A NEW THIS IS A MOUNTAIN YEARS TIGHT OF NOT
H5AJOM7RRg0_7 SO THIS WOULD ACTUALLY BE A A LIAR ROPE YEARS OF THIS BLOCK OF WOOD
H5AJOM7RRg0_8 THE FREEZE OF INSTRUCTION AND THAT WOULD HERE
H5AJOM7RRg0_9 A BASIC THIS IS MY CRUISING <UNK>
H5AJOM7RRg0_10 INSTEAD OF TIGHTENING DOWN EASIEST AND I'M A LOOP HERE
H5AJOM7RRg0_11 SO IT IS AND BRING MY LOOP BACK AROUND ONE EXTRA TURN
H5AJOM7RRg0_12 ANIMAL PULL MY LINES THROUGH LIKE SO
H5AJOM7RRg0_13 AS YOU CAN SEE THIS NOT ISN'T REALLY GONNA SLIP
H5AJOM7RRg0_14 ESPECIALLY THIS WAS A ROPE HERE INSTEAD OF WOOD IS REMOVABLE THAT SLICKS IT IS NOT WILL SLIP ON THIS
H5AJOM7RRg0_15 WE USE IN WHAT MUDDY CONDITIONS CLIMBERS I USE THIS RIGHT HERE ON ANOTHER ROW TO KEEP THIS FROM MOVING
H5AJOM7RRg0_16 SO IMAGES ON AND DO THIS ON THIS RUN ALL IT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF RUNNING A PRUSAK KNOT
H5AJOM7RRg0_17 AND THEN THE DOUBLE PRISON
H5AJOM7RRg0_18 BECAUSE IT BE MADE IT A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND HERE
H5AJOM7RRg0_19 SO MY LINE ON WOMEN THAT TIME A LITTLE WORKING ENDS TOGETHER OF BAT
H5AJOM7RRg0_20 IF DOUBLE OVERHAND LIKE SO
H5AJOM7RRg0_21 TAKE IT HEY CAN RUN IT THROUGH
H5AJOM7RRg0_22 AND WHEN MY LOOP THROUGH ONCE RUN IT OVER AGAIN
H5AJOM7RRg0_23 IN A LITTLE BIT MORE LENGTH
H5AJOM7RRg0_24 OR IT THROUGH TWICE
H5AJOM7RRg0_25 MAKE SURE THAT THESE DON'T CROSSOVER LIKE THAT OR MIXTURE THIS KNOT IS NICE AND NEAT
H5AJOM7RRg0_26 THIS IS A SAFETY LINE
H5AJOM7RRg0_27 OR SWOOP A LITTLE MORE TIME AND THROUGH LIKE SO
H5AJOM7RRg0_28 DOES IT HERE
H5AJOM7RRg0_29 OR THE AGAIN
H5AJOM7RRg0_30 A DOUBLE CRUCIAL
GhhzAPFwzas_1 HI THIS IS YOLANDA VANVEEN FROM VANDERVEEN BOLDS DOT COM
GhhzAPFwzas_2 I'M IN THIS SECTION WE'LL TALK ABOUT HOW THE CLONE PLANTS
GhhzAPFwzas_3 NOW THIS SUBJECT I REALLY I'M VERY INTERESTED IN BECAUSE I FOUND MOST OF THE PLANTS IN THE WORLD HAVE BEEN CLONED
GhhzAPFwzas_4 AND IT'S FASCINATING TO ME THE WHOLE PROCESS AND HOW IT WORKS
GhhzAPFwzas_5 IT'S VERY SIMPLE
GhhzAPFwzas_6 PLANTER A SEXUAL THAT MEANS THAT THEY HAVE ALL THE GENETICS WITHIN THEMSELVES
GhhzAPFwzas_7 THEY DON'T NEED A BOY INTEGRAL PLANT TO MAKE BIG
GhhzAPFwzas_8 AND IT'S REALLY EASY TO SEE THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT A LILY BOLT
GhhzAPFwzas_9 A LILY BALD CLONES ITSELF
GhhzAPFwzas_10 SO EACH LITTLE CLOVE DISLIKE AND GARLIC WILL MAKE ITS OWN PLANTS
GhhzAPFwzas_11 SO WHEN THERE'S A NEW VARIETY A LILY COMES OUT THAT'S ON THE SPECIAL OR EXCITING OR WHEN THAT THEY WANT A REPRODUCE THE CLONE IT BY JUST SEPARATING IT'S INTO LITTLE PIECES
GhhzAPFwzas_12 AND THAT WAY THEY'LL START THIRTY FORTY NEW PLANTS FROM ONE
GhhzAPFwzas_13 AND IT'LL BE A IDENTICALLY GENETIC TO THE MOTHER PLANTS
GhhzAPFwzas_14 AND THAT WAY IF YOU HAVE A NEW BREEDING COLOR THIS REALLY INTERESTING OR WITH A LOT OF MONEY YOU CAN AM CLONE IT VERY EASILY
GhhzAPFwzas_16 THEY'RE ALSO CLONING THROUGH TISSUE CULTURE NOW CHILLED
GhhzAPFwzas_17 SO ALL THEY NEED IS ONE SELL
GhhzAPFwzas_18 EVERY LITTLE CELL JUST AT FINGERNAIL SCRATCHING OF THAT PLANT HAS ALL THAT IN AND MAKE IT FOR IT
GhhzAPFwzas_19 AND THEY CAN CLONE FROM THAT ONE LITTLE SAMPLE THROUGH TISSUE CULTURE
GhhzAPFwzas_20 AND THEY JUST LET IT GROW INTO A BOWL BLITZ IN THAT GROWS INTO A BALL FROM ONE LITTLE SELL
GhhzAPFwzas_21 IT'S AMAZING TO ME
GhhzAPFwzas_22 IT'S A PLANT CAN ALSO CLONE THEMSELVES BY ROOTS
GhhzAPFwzas_23 SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IN THE MOTHER PLANT JUST MAKES MORE ROOTS INTO IT MAKES A BABY
GhhzAPFwzas_24 SO THE BABY IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE MOTHER AND THERE'S NO GENETIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO
GhhzAPFwzas_25 AND THAT'S IT EASY WAY FOR GRASS FOR EXAMPLE THIS FLAX TO MULTIPLY
GhhzAPFwzas_26 THEY ALSO PRODUCE SEATS IN FEEDS ON OUR MIXED WITH OTHER TYPES OF GRASSES AND THEY CAN BE DIFFERENT GENETICALLY
GhhzAPFwzas_27 THE CLOSER NEVER DIFFERENT GENETICALLY THAN THE MOTHER <UNK>
GhhzAPFwzas_28 ANOTHER WAY THAT PLANTS CLONE THEMSELVES IS THROUGH RUNNERS
GhhzAPFwzas_29 SO A LILAC WILL HAVE DIFFERENT SHOOTS COMING UP THE BOTTOM AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY PULL THAT SHOOT UP AND THAT'S BASICALLY CLONE OF ITS MOTHER'S NO DIFFERENT THAN THE MOTHER
GhhzAPFwzas_30 IMPLANTS LIKE THIS GERANIUM YOU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE A ROOT CUTTINGS YOU CAN TAKE STEM CUTTINGS AND IT'LL MAKE ITS OWN PLANTS
GhhzAPFwzas_31 AND THOSE ARE CLOSER EXACT REPRODUCTION OF THE MOTHER PLANTS
GhhzAPFwzas_32 AND THE EASIEST WAY THAT I HAVE FOUND TO CLONE PLANTS ARE TO TAKE GREW CUTTINGS SUSTAIN BASIC HONEY AND PUT IT INTO STRAIGHT SHOT JAR ARE STRAIGHT SHOT GLASS MIX IT REALLY EASY AND DON'T USE A LOT THAT WAY
GhhzAPFwzas_33 AND WHEN YOU'RE TAKING A STEM YOU GO TO WEAR TO STARTS KNEES
GhhzAPFwzas_34 SO AT THIS POINT AS LONG AS I BREAK IT AWAY FROM THE STEM
GhhzAPFwzas_35 AND I ALWAYS TRY TO DO A WORD THE NEXT LEAF IS IN THAT WAY THE FILL IN TOGETHER HEALTH
GhhzAPFwzas_36 SO BY JUST TAKING A CUTTING
GhhzAPFwzas_37 IT CAN TEAR IT OFF OR CUT OFF IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER I FOUND PUZZLE GROW ROOTS
GhhzAPFwzas_38 A LOT OF TIMES SAY TO CUT IT AN ANGLE BUT I FOUND A LEAVING LEAVING IT AND A LITTLE BIT OF THIS RED IT'LL BOOT EVEN BETTER
GhhzAPFwzas_39 SEE EASIEST WAY TO START A NEW GERANIUM AND I DON'T HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT EVEN DIPPING INTO HONEY JUST THE RIGHT AND SOIL
GhhzAPFwzas_40 THIS DIP IT A LITTLE BIT OF HONEY
GhhzAPFwzas_41 AND THE HONEY ACTUALLY ACTS IDEAS THAT ENERGY TO IS THE SUGAR
GhhzAPFwzas_42 SO IT SEEMS TO BOND IN THAT WAY THE ROOTS AND GROW BETTER
GhhzAPFwzas_43 AND JUST PUT IT'S MIDI ONE TO TWO INCHES ONE TO TWO INCHES IN THE GROUND
GhhzAPFwzas_44 AND IT ALSO HELPS TO CUT SOME OF THE BOTTOM LEAVES OFF SO THAT AS THE TOP LEAVES ARE LEFT
GhhzAPFwzas_45 AND THAT WAY THEY SEEM TO GROW BETTER BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT MORE ENERGY TO PUT TO THE TOP LEAVES
GhhzAPFwzas_46 IF YOU KEEP CHECKING ON IT I FOUND A GERANIUMS WILL GROW QUITE QUICKLY IN WITHIN A MONTH WILL HAVE A WHOLE ANOTHER PLANT
gY2MSxD4-s4_1 OKAY IN THE LAST SEGMENT WE LEARNED THAT USING ENGLISH DOES NOT HELPLESS CONTROL THE DIRECTION THAT A CUE BALL COMES OFF OF AN OBJECT BALL AT AN ANGLE
gY2MSxD4-s4_2 THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA SET UP THE SAME JOT SAME WAY AND WE'RE GOING TO HIT IT WITH ENGLISH AS WE DID LAST THREE TIMES
gY2MSxD4-s4_3 WE'RE IN A HIT ONE TIME WITHOUT ANY ENGLISH
gY2MSxD4-s4_4 BUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR THIS TIME IS WHAT ANGLED IS THE CUE BALL COME OFF OF THE CUSHION
gY2MSxD4-s4_5 AND I'M GONNA GET A LITTLE CLUE
gY2MSxD4-s4_6 THIS IS WHERE ENGLISH IS USED
gY2MSxD4-s4_7 YOU USE ENGLISH TO CONTROL THE ANGLES THAT EIGHT BALL COMES OFF OF A CUSHION NOT THE ANGLES AND IT COMES OFF OF ONE OF THE BALL
gY2MSxD4-s4_8 SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE SHOT ONCE AGAIN HIT IT WITH NO ENGLISH AND WE'RE GOING TO HIT IT A SLIGHT AT FLOWS OVER TO OUR SQUAT AND WE SEE THAT IT GIVES IS AN ANGLE THAT COMES OFF ROUGHLY THE SAME AS THE ANGLE THAT IT WHEN IN
gY2MSxD4-s4_9 NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO TAKE THAT SHOT AND WE'RE GONNA USE LEFT HAND ENGLISH AND IT SHOULD COME RIGHT OVER PRETTY MUCH TO THAT SAME VISA CHALK
gY2MSxD4-s4_10 BUT WATCH WHAT ANGLE IT COMES OFF AT THIS TIME
gY2MSxD4-s4_11 COMES OFF WAY OVER HERE
gY2MSxD4-s4_12 NOW WE'RE GOING TO USE THAT SAME SEDU GOING TO USE LEFT AND ENGLISH THIS TIE
gY2MSxD4-s4_13 AND THE RIGHT HANDING AND PSI
gY2MSxD4-s4_14 NOT CAME UP STRAIGHTER
gY2MSxD4-s4_15 SO HERE WE CAN COME UP THIS WAY WITH NO ENGLISH THIS WAY WITH RIGHT HAND ENGLISH AND THIS WAY WITH LEFT IN ENGLISH
gY2MSxD4-s4_16 SO WE'RE CHANGING THE ANGLE THAT COMES OFF OF A CUSHION AND WE'RE DOING THAT FOR POSITIONING BURGOS
hgZ_GabeHAQ_1 THE FIRST POINT ORGAN AND DO IS CROOKED POOL OR LARGE INTESTINE ELEVEN
hgZ_GabeHAQ_2 THIS ONE IS PARTICULARLY GOOD FOR DRAINING HE IN DAMPNESS IN THE ELBOW JOINT
hgZ_GabeHAQ_3 FOR THIS IS ONE YOU WANT TO USE ESPECIALLY FOR A DOG WHO HAVE HOT TENDER TO THE TOUCH ELBOW
hgZ_GabeHAQ_4 THIS WILL BE A PARTICULARLY GOOD ONE
hgZ_GabeHAQ_5 AND DAMPNESS IF THE LEG COMES TO SWELL UP ON OR IF THE DOG RESPONDS IN IS WORSE IN WORSE PAIN ON DAMP DAYS THIS IS GOING TO BE YOU A GOOD POINT FREE TO USE
hgZ_GabeHAQ_6 YOU DON'T HAVE TO THE MOMENT HANDS A LOT IS USUALLY HOT ENTIRE YOU PROBABLY DON'T ONE USES POI
hgZ_GabeHAQ_7 YOU WANT SKIP THAT
hgZ_GabeHAQ_8 IT IS FOUND BY GOING DOWN INTO THE CREASE OF THE ELBOW RIGHT IN THE SIDE
hgZ_GabeHAQ_9 IN AS WITH MOST TACKY PRESSURE POINTS YOU FINGERS AND FALL INTO THIS HOLE
hgZ_GabeHAQ_10 AND THEN THREE ONE CREATURE PRESSURE
hgZ_GabeHAQ_11 YOU CAN DO A STEADY ONE FINGER PRESSURE TO STAYING IN THAT PLACE WORT YOU CAN DO CIRCULAR MOTION WITH YOUR THUMB WORT WITH THE BALL OF YOUR FINGER
hgZ_GabeHAQ_12 ANY OF THOSE WILL THE WORK JUST FINE

HFpzop3y4H4_1 HI I'M TY BROWN WITH DOG BEHAVIOR ONLINE DOG
HFpzop3y4H4_2 COMMON I'M HERE IN RIVERTON UTAH TODAY TEACHING YOU HOW TO TRAIN A DOG
HFpzop3y4H4_3 THE TOPIC OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION IS TEACHING YOUR DOG HOW TO USE A DOG THE DOOR
HFpzop3y4H4_4 NOW A LOT OF DOGS A LITTLE BIT THREATENED BY THE CONCEPT OF A DOG A DOOR BECAUSE ON FIRST GLANCE IT LOOKS LIKE JUST ANOTHER PART OF THE WALL AND SO TO TEACH YOUR DOG TO RUN INTO THAT PART OF THE WALL AND GO THROUGH CAN BE A LITTLE BIT DAUNTING OFF AND SO YOU WANT TO DO IS SET USE SET YOURSELF UP AND SET YOUR DOG UP FOR SUCCESS
HFpzop3y4H4_5 IN THE BEGINNING STAGES HEADER DOG WHERE LEASH APPROACH THE DOOR AND GIVE HIM A COMMAND SUCH AS GO THROUGH OR GO POTTY OR SOME OTHER COMMAND LIKE THAT SO THAT THE DOG IS FUMES TO DO SOMETHING
HFpzop3y4H4_6 ONCE YOU SAID THAT USE LEASH TO IMPEL HIM THROUGH THE DOOR
HFpzop3y4H4_7 IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO JUST CONTINUE HELPING HIM
HFpzop3y4H4_8 IF YOU REALLY DOESN'T WANT TO GO GET A PARTNER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR IF AN TO HELP YOU
HFpzop3y4H4_9 PULL THE LEASH THROUGH AND HAVE THE PARTNER HANNAH GIVE A COUPLE TONS OF THE DOG COMES THROUGH
HFpzop3y4H4_10 ONCE HE NEXT IT'S OR THE OTHER SIDE AT THAT POINT IS VERY CRITICAL THAT YOU REALLY MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD ABOUT HIS VICTORY
HFpzop3y4H4_11 GIVE THEM A TREAT GIVE HIM SOME BRAIDS HELP THEM FEEL REALLY GOOD THAT INNATE IS WAY THROUGH THE DOOR
HFpzop3y4H4_12 NOW IF YOU DO THIS WITH A LOT OF REPETITION THE DOG ASSUME THAT A LEARN ALL THAT DOGGY DOORS AND SO FEARFUL THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT AND EASILY GO THROUGH ON ITS OWN
HFpzop3y4H4_13 UNTIL YOU GET INTO THAT POINT YOU GOTTA DO A LOT OF HELPING ELATA SHOWING SO THAT THE DOG CAN MAKE A DECISION ON IS ON AND THAT'S HOW YOU TRAIN A DOG HOW TO USE THE DOG A DOOR
H2PCNz3X7yA_2 MY NAME IS HAROLD HALL FROM FORT LAUDERDALE ARCHERS IN FORT LAUDERDALE FLORIDA AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT THAT YOU WOULD USE FOR ARCHERY
H2PCNz3X7yA_3 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME YOU
H2PCNz3X7yA_4 OKAY ONE OF THE ASPECTS IF YOU NEED OUT IS A GOOD TARGET ON
H2PCNz3X7yA_5 WE HAVE A TARGET FRAME HERE WHICH WAS BUILT UP OUT OF LOW PRESSURE TREATED WOOD
H2PCNz3X7yA_6 ALL IT HAS A LIGHT AND AT THAT WHICH IS USED FOR NIGHT TIME
H2PCNz3X7yA_7 SO THAT YOU IF YOU COME OUT IT'S DARKEN YOU CAN SEE
H2PCNz3X7yA_8 NOW SOME OF THE B OWN AND THE BACK STOCK USE MADE OUT OF A OF WAS CALLED INSULATION MATERIAL OF WITH HUES FOR FLATBACK SUN RUBS ON LET'S USE ONE ONE TYPE OF MATERIAL
H2PCNz3X7yA_9 YOU CAN SWITCH TARGETS AND THEIR HOMES HAVE WHAT'S CALLED TARGET FINS WHICH HOLDS YOUR FUEL HOLDER FAKE ON
H2PCNz3X7yA_10 A ON IT'S A PRETTY LONG CONSTRUCTED TARGET OF IT YOU CAN SEE I'M THAT THERE THERE'S VARIOUS LOUSY AT IT AND WOODROOF ON IT WHICH KEEPS THE WATER OUT FROM IT
H2PCNz3X7yA_11 I'M IS YOU KEEP THINGS FROM DECENT DRY HE
Gv4uy35II0M_1 ANOTHER WAY TO DO SHADOWING ON YOUR DRAWING IS BY USING A VERY FINE TIPPED FELT PAN SO THIS EXAMPLE NOW WE'VE DRAWN IN OUR PLAYFUL CAT WAS A VERY BASIC COLORS AND I'LL ADD IN SOME SHADOWING SO BASICALLY WITH VERY VERY FINE LINES YOU SEE THESE ARE REALLY SMALL VERY SMALL
Gv4uy35II0M_2 I TRACE ALONG THE BACK HERE AND YOU NOTICE VERY QUICKLY THAT THE DRAWING STARTS TO TAKE ON SOME MORE DEPTH SOME MORE WEIGHT THREE DIMENSIONAL ATTRIBUTES AS OPPOSED TO JUST HAVING THE GOOD BUT STILL ULTIMATELY QUICKLY SCRIBBLE LONG LINES WE STARTED WITH
Gv4uy35II0M_3 CARTOONS LIKE OTHER FORMS A DRAWINGS ARE STILL WORKS OF ART YOU BUILD UP
Gv4uy35II0M_4 THEY'RE DIFFERENT LAYERS TO THEM
Gv4uy35II0M_5 THERE'S THE BASIC UNDER DRAWING
Gv4uy35II0M_6 THERE'S ADDING ON COLLAR SHAPE SHADOW SO IN THIS CASE IS BRING THE SHADOW IS HAVE A SHADOW GO ALL AROUND THE BODY SO BRING UP OVER HER ON THE PAUSE
Gv4uy35II0M_7 NOW NOTICE HOW I MEAN I DON'T TENDER BRING A SHADOW ALL THE WAY AROUND EVERYTHING
Gv4uy35II0M_8 AND IF I WAS GOOD BECOME A PIG ASIDE UNLESS AN OBJECT MOST OF THE IN TOTAL DARKNESS SO CAN PICK A SIDE IT WITH A SHOT OF A GOAL LIKE I'M DOING HERE
Gv4uy35II0M_9 GET EVEN SHADOW A LITTLE BIT OF THE WHISKER AREA TO GET YOUR CATTLE BUT MORE OF A SMILE THERE
Gv4uy35II0M_10 IN KEGEL THAT OF THE LINE
Gv4uy35II0M_11 THEY CAN ALSO ADD SHADOWING TO THE BALL OF YARN
Gv4uy35II0M_12 YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE THIS A LITTLE MORE PRONOUNCED THAN YOUR CAT BECAUSE IT CAN BE HARDER TO SEE SONY FIERMAN HAVE SOME SHADOWING GOING ON UNDERNEATH THE BALL ON THE UNDERSIDE I'M NOT GOING MIXED IN ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP IT SOAKS FERMENT HOWEVER YOU LIKE WITH THE SHADOWING
Gv4uy35II0M_13 THE BASIC THING TO REMEMBER IS A VERIFY FELTED PAN TO THE EXCELLENT FOR ADDING SHADOW IN DEPTH YOUR CAT CARTOONS ALREADY CARTOONS FOR THAT MATTER
GqgNoF6Ndr0_1 I'M NOW MANY OF THEM AND PUT THE BIKE ON THE FLOOR AND IF AND OVER IT TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS WHERE I LIKE IT
GqgNoF6Ndr0_2 AND THIS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE I HAVE THE GLITTER HOOK AND BRAKE LEVER ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HANDLEBAR I HAVE SOMETHING TO WORK WITH
GqgNoF6Ndr0_3 USUALLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE
GqgNoF6Ndr0_4 SO WHAT I DO IS I START OFF WHILE ADJUST MY BREAK THE LOCK ON ZAGREB'S HAS THE HAVE WILL TENSE I WON ADJUSTED SO THE BOLT HEADS ARE ANYWHERE NEAR WHERE I'M AND BRING THE HANDS BECAUSE THAT'S NOT VERY COMFORTABLE
GqgNoF6Ndr0_5 TAKE MY THREE MILLIMETER WRENCH OR TO TO POINT FIVE MILLIMETER WRENCH FOR USING THE OBI BRAND GRIPS
GqgNoF6Ndr0_6 TIGHTEN THIS UP TO BID TORQUE AND IN A TIGHTEN UP THE OTHER HAND SO NOW I HAVE MY GRIPS INSTALL AND I'M READY TO SET MY BRAKE LEVER
GqgNoF6Ndr0_7 FOR ME OF BRAKE LEVER POSITIONS LOT MORE CRITICAL THAN SHIFTER POSITION AND BECAUSE HE BREAKS ARE IN THE MOST IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ARSENIC COMES DULA CONTROLLING THE BIKE
GqgNoF6Ndr0_8 SO I LIKE TO SET THINGS OUT SO I HAVE A NICE EVEN ANGLE DOWN MY HAND TO MY REST TO WRAP AROUND THE BRAKE LEVER ON I ALSO LIKE TO BE A PERSONALLY LIKE TO BE A RIDGE THE BRAKE LEVER MY HAND IS ON THE AND THE HAND WARLOCK FIT
GqgNoF6Ndr0_9 JUST ONE FINGER IS THE BRIDGE AND GOOD ENOUGH AND WON'T YOU MIGHT HOLD AND BREAK
GqgNoF6Ndr0_10 SOME PEOPLE PREFER TO USE TWO FINGERS OR OTHER FINGERS TO BREAK AND THEY MIGHT END UP SLIDING A BRAKE LEVER OUT THIS WAY SO THAT IT'S MORE NATURAL TO HAVE THEIR HAND ON THE AND THE BAR PULL IN THE MIDDLE FINGER TWO FINGERS BUT THAT'S NOT MY PREFERENCE
GqgNoF6Ndr0_11 I'M A FINE THE ANGLE FEELS GOOD IN THIS FEELS PRETTY GOOD AND HOLD THAT RUN MY FOUR MILLIMETER WRENCH AND TIGHTEN THESE UP FOR THE FINGER TIGHT
GqgNoF6Ndr0_12 THIS IS A REALLY LIGHT UP APPLICATION ONE STILL BE ABLE TO REACH DOWN IN A JUST LEAVES HIS THAT MEANS IF YOU CRASH ON A WILL MOVE OUT OF THE WAY INSTEAD OF BREAKING

gNOe0UogfY0_3 I LIKE TO INCORPORATE GOOD AMOUNTS OF ORGANIC FERTILIZER INITIAL PLANTING
gNOe0UogfY0_4 NOW THE THREE NUMBERS ON A FERTILIZERS NITROGEN PHOSPHOROUS AND POTASSIUM ORGANIC FERTILIZER TAN NOT TO BE AS HIGH AS IN ORGANIC CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS BUT INITIAL PLANTING INCORPORATE TO THE THREE POUNDS FOR EVERYONE UNDER SQUARE FEET OF A GOOD ORGANIC ANALYSIS INCORPORATE INTO THAT COMPOST THAT INITIAL PLANTING A WHISTLE VEGETABLES GET GOING MAY GET HUNGRY
gNOe0UogfY0_5 SO YOU HAVE TO USE A HIGH AS SELLER RATED NITROGEN LIKE AN EIGHTEEN SIX TWELVE NINETEEN FIVE NINE OR TWENTY ONE SEVEN FOURTEEN EVERY TWO TO THREE WEEKS THROUGHOUT THE GROWING SEASON IS PUT IT ON THE SIDE OF THE PLANT AND WATERED IN REAL WELL
gpccQOvjw6E_1 AS YOUR COMPUTER GETS OLDER PROBABLY STARTING NOTICE IT'S GETTING SLOWER

HibeZ7jFGwc_1 OKAY IN THIS SECTION I'M IN THE TEACH YOU HOW TO CARVING AS HE TURN AS OPPOSED TO SWITCHING AS YOU TURN AROUND AND BEING CANNA SLOPPY GOING ON AND ON
HibeZ7jFGwc_2 THE DIFFERENCE IS OFF SET OF LANE SOME OF PRESSURE ON THE SLOW AND SWITCH YOUR BODY AROUND AND GIVE IT A FOOT FOR PRESSURE ON YOUR BUILD SOME ALLOW THE INSIDE EDGE OF THIS LEAD TO WORK BY ITSELF AND HARD THE TURN AROUND
HibeZ7jFGwc_3 WHEN YOU'RE SHIFTING FEET WHAT YOU DO IS YOU SHIFT THE WEIGHT TO THE FOUR PRESSURE OF THIS THROUGH AND SEE HOW THE CARD THIS TURN AROUND
HibeZ7jFGwc_4 PRETTY MUCH WHAT YOU WANT TO KEEP IN MIND FIZZ PUTTING FOR PRESSURE AND ALLOWING THE SLEEVE TO WORK WITH AT WITH ITS ACTUAL SHAPE INSIDE OF CHINA MUSCLE THE SKI AROUND LIKE BEFORE
HibeZ7jFGwc_5 THE REASON FOR USING A CARVING TURN AS OPPOSED TO THE BASICS NOTHING TURN AS ALLOWS YOU TO CARRY MORE SPEED AND BE MORE FLUID AND IF YOU ARE PROGRESSING AND YOU'VE SEEN ON THIS STEEPER MORE ADVANCED IS HERE ON THE CINNAMON GETS ATTACHING APPEAL TO MAKE IT DOWN THERE SAFELY
HibeZ7jFGwc_6 SO I'M IT'S DEADLY SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY DOESN'T WANT TO LINE UP THE POSES WITHIN THE BODY SIDEWAYS BECAUSE JUST TO MAKE IT ALL AROUND BATTERS HERE
HibeZ7jFGwc_7 PROBABLY THE MOST MORE INTENTIONAL AND RESULTS HOW MORE FUN WITH IT
HibeZ7jFGwc_8 OF AS A WHAT AMENITY WALK YOU THROUGH NOW IS AND HOW IT TO CARD IS HE TURN
HibeZ7jFGwc_9 THIS IS IN AND A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN THIS HE TURNS AND THAT YOU MIGHT PREVIOUSLY OF LEARN AND
HibeZ7jFGwc_10 WHILE WE'RE NOT AND THE SWITCH YOUR BODY AROUND IT WILL ACTUALLY BE LETTING THE SKIS WORK WITH AN ACTUAL IT WITH THEIR NATURAL SHAPE
HibeZ7jFGwc_11 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS APPLY FOR PRESSURE TO THE BOOT THAT'S THE VIEW DOWNHILL SKI
HibeZ7jFGwc_12 SO FOR THE MAKING A LEFT FIELD TURN ONE OF THE APPLYING PRESSURE TO THE RIGHT BOOM
HibeZ7jFGwc_13 WHO MAKING A LEFT FILTER AND BE OF KLEIN FOR PRESSURE IF TO YOUR LEFT MOVE
HibeZ7jFGwc_14 ALONG WITH THIS ONE MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STILT LIVE TAKING OFF A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE OF THE UPHILL SKI

HibeZ7jFGwc_16 IF YOU NOTICE WHEN STARTING OFF WITH THE PROPER STANCE HALF AND REAPPLY IN HALF FULL WORK FRESHER F TO THIS FOOT AND FOR PRESSURE TO THE SLOW
HibeZ7jFGwc_17 IT'S REALLY MAKING A SMOOTH INTER IF AS OPPOSE HALF TO TWO SWITCH MY BODY AROUND
HibeZ7jFGwc_18 IF YOU'LL NOTICE HIS SEE THIS THESE RACKS WERE WEARING IT'S THIS MOVE LINE RIGHT THERE AND NOT SWISHING MY BODY AROUND THE SO BE A LOT FASTER AND A LOT MORE EFFECTIVE WAY TO SEE

gM6tndOzWsU_3 WE'VE MENTIONED SEVERAL TIME THAT THERE IS IMPORTANT FEATURES THAT YOU NEED TO DECIDE ON BUT NOW MOST USERS WOULD SAY HOW OR FIND OUT IF THE MACHINE HANDS THOSE THINGS
gM6tndOzWsU_4 I KNOW I NEED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MEMORY I KNOW I NEED A CERTAIN CPU CANOLA NEED CERTAIN THINGS BUT HOW DO I FIND OUT OF THOSE THINGS IN THERE AND FUNCTIONAL
gM6tndOzWsU_5 START WITH FIND A PLACE WHERE THERE'S POWER WHERE THERE'S A MONITOR A KEYBOARD MOUSE AVAILABLE
gM6tndOzWsU_6 HOPEFULLY THE THE OWNER OF THE MACHINE SEWING IT TO YOU WILL HAVE AN ALL AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO BE WOULD DO THAT
gM6tndOzWsU_7 TURNING ON MAKE SURE IT COMES UP WITHOUT ANY ERRORS
gM6tndOzWsU_8 ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE MACHINE TURNED ON FIRST ASSUMING IT'S WINDOWS XP SCENT WE FIND MY COMPUTER IN THE START MENU RIGHT CLICK ON THAT ICON SHOES PROPERTIES
gM6tndOzWsU_9 THE FIRST RING THAT COMES UP SHOWS YOU WHAT THE SYSTEM HAZARDS FOURS NORMALLY WHAT LEVEL OF LE XP IS ON IT AS WELL AS WHAT CPU AT HATS
gM6tndOzWsU_10 THEN IF YOU CLICK ON THE HARDWARE TAB AND CHOOSE DEVICE MANAGER IT WILL NOW OPEN UP AN ENTIRE SCREEN THAT SHOWS ALL OF THE RECOGNIZE AND ON RECOGNIZE DEVICES ON THAT COMPUTER

_gBJRqR36fo_15 AND IF YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THESE METHODS WORK
_gBJRqR36fo_16 IS NOT ONE WAY THAT WORKS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER

GEUQjTIpnmA_16 IT IS NOW ARE IN A BEGINNING OVER THIS LITTLE WHICH ARE CALLED MUDDY IT
GEUQjTIpnmA_17 THE SAME TIME THOUGH AFTER DONE PAINTING THE CHALK WILL NOT SHOW THROUGH LIKE SOME OTHER THINGS LIKE PENCIL WELL
gBfs4UNJF0w_1 THEN SHEDDING CAN BE ANY BUDDIES RESPONSIBILITY
gBfs4UNJF0w_2 ANYBODY WHO IS NOT ACTIVELY IN AGAIN INCLUDED ON LINE UP CARD CAN BE A PEN CHEDDAR
gBfs4UNJF0w_3 ON THE BENCH HEADER CAN BE EXPECTED TO BOND AND IN THE EXPECTED IN A HOME RUN BLEEDING THE EXPECTED WALL ON
gBfs4UNJF0w_4 HE BASICALLY SUBSTITUTES FOR HITTERS IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS
gBfs4UNJF0w_5 FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE A LEFT HANDED BATTER RAN AGAINST A LEFT HANDED PICTURE YOU MAY WANT PINCH IT RIGHT HANDED BENCH BETTER IF ON TO PLAY THE NUMBERS
gBfs4UNJF0w_6 GENERALLY IT RIGHT HANDERS WILL HAVE A BETTER BATTING AVERAGE ON IN THAT SITUATION
gBfs4UNJF0w_7 SO PENS HITTING HIM THE EVERYBODY'S RESPONSIBILITY
gBfs4UNJF0w_8 YOUR MAIN JOB IS TO COME INTO THE GAIN CALL WITH ON AND GET IT IF IT IS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE IS VERY SIMPLE THAT WAY NOW
gBfs4UNJF0w_9 SOMETIMES THEN SHOULDER'S WILL BE SPECIALIZE
gBfs4UNJF0w_10 THEY'LL BE BROUGHT IN AGAIN FROM FONT ON TO GET SACRIFICE FLIES OR SACRIFICE BONDS THINGS LIKE THAT
gBfs4UNJF0w_11 GENERALLY ON ANY ONE WILL BE ASKED TO BE A PEN CHEDDAR
gBfs4UNJF0w_12 EVERYONE BE ASKED ME VENTED OF AT SOME POINT OR ANOTHER
gBfs4UNJF0w_13 EVEN IF YOUR BIG HITTERS LIGHT VERY SHEFFIELD ODD SHIPPER JONES AND DREW JONES AVENT VERY BONDS ARE PENSIONERS
gBfs4UNJF0w_14 THEY'LL START THE GAME FOR THE STILL BE EXPECTING TO BE ON THE BENCH AND BE READY TO BE CALLED APPAN LATER IN THE GAME IF THEIR TEAM NEEDS
gBfs4UNJF0w_15 SO THE BENCH HEADER IS ANOTHER TYPE OF BACKUP PLAYER THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO TEAMS SUCCESS

Hfh2d_K94HU_5 NOW THAT IT IS A TECHNIQUE CALLED OCTAVE IN
Hfh2d_K94HU_6 IT'S CUT LIKE A POWER CHORD LIKE THIS
Hfh2d_K94HU_7 IN THIS CASE GOODIES THE SECOND FRET OF THE A STRING THE FOURTH FRET COOL WE WOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT MIDDLE ONE IS AN OCTAVE
Hfh2d_K94HU_8 DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM
Hfh2d_K94HU_9 THE MUTED OUT WITH OUR INDEX FINGER
Hfh2d_K94HU_10 ALWAYS LOOKING FOR PINKIE ON THE FOURTH FRET OF THE G STRING
Hfh2d_K94HU_11 NOW WHEN IT OBVIOUSLY TOGETHER SO LIKE THIS
Hfh2d_K94HU_12 I HAVE HERE THAT NOTE WAS MUTED OUT
Hfh2d_K94HU_13 AND HANRAHAN ALL THREE IT HAD GET AN OCTAVE
Hfh2d_K94HU_14 THIS IS THE LOWER OCTAVE AND IS THE HIGH UP
Hfh2d_K94HU_15 DO THE SAME NOTE AN OCTAVE OF OUR
Hfh2d_K94HU_16 AND HAVE MY GOAL WITH THIS RED
Hfh2d_K94HU_17 AND GO TO ONE FOR A HALF AN INCH HOOTEN HANDS SLIDE UP TO WHICH IS FOUR AND SIX A STRING G STRING THE HAND ON A BEND IT I HAVEN'T FIND THEM IN HALF

Hfh2d_K94HU_21 SLOWLY THIS RIFF SOUNDS LIKE THIS A BACKHAND
Hfh2d_K94HU_22 THE OCTAVE IN TRICK IS A COOL WAY A TO RUN LINES IN JUST LIKE RUNNING I'M MELODY ON ONE STRING
Hfh2d_K94HU_23 YOU DO THAT OCTAVE TRICK IN IN AND MOVE IT UP IT'S ON THICKER
Hfh2d_K94HU_24 SO PRACTICE THAT TECHNIQUE IS REALLY COOL AND HAVING A GUITAR PLAYING ARSENAL
Hfh2d_K94HU_25 IN THE NEXT SEGMENT WHEN IT'S OUT WHAT IRON MAIDENS RUN TO THE
Hfh2d_K94HU_26 I'LL SEE YOU THERE
HiPCZZl51Ww_1 IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT LAG PUTTING PUTTING FROM OUTSIDE TWENTY FIVE FEET
HiPCZZl51Ww_2 THERE ARE GET ABOUT THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY FOOT ON THE PRACTICE PUTTING IT TEMPLE PALMS
HiPCZZl51Ww_3 IN MORE THAN ANYTHING WITH LAG PUTTING WHICH YOU WANT TO DO IS GET A SENSE FOR THE OVERALL DISTANCE
HiPCZZl51Ww_4 THE SPEED OF THE POT IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT THEN IT'S DIRECTION
HiPCZZl51Ww_5 OF COURSE OF THE POT THE SLOPE YOU'RE PUTTING ON IS PRETTY SEVERE YOU BETTER AIM IT OUT TO THE HIGH POINT
HiPCZZl51Ww_6 MY POINT IS IS PEOPLE TEND TO FOCUS ON THE LINE AND FORGET ABOUT THE SPEED NOT REALIZING THAT THE ODDS OF BEEN MAKING THIS POT ARE VERY GOOD
HiPCZZl51Ww_7 IN THE OPPOSITE THAN THREE POTTING ARE PRETTY HIGH NOT BECAUSE THEY MISS A SECOND ONE SO MUCH AS THEY DIDN'T LAG THE FIRST ONE CLOSE ENOUGH TO WHERE IT WAS IN JUST A TAP IT
HiPCZZl51Ww_8 SO WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS I LIKE TO GET ABOUT HALFWAY OR AND I TRY TO GET A SENSE OF WHICH WAY THE SPOTS IN A BREAK
HiPCZZl51Ww_9 I SEE BREAKING FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
HiPCZZl51Ww_10 SO I'M TRYING TO PICK A HIGH POINT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE BALL IN THE HOLE
HiPCZZl51Ww_11 I GO UP TO THAT HIGH POINT AND I'LL MAKE A COUPLE PRACTICE THROWS LOOKING AT THE HOLE
HiPCZZl51Ww_12 JUST TRY TO GET A SENSE OF HOW HOT HOW HARD THE BALL NEEDS TO BE MOVING HERE FOR IT TO GET TO THE HOLE
HiPCZZl51Ww_13 THAT'LL WALK BACK
HiPCZZl51Ww_14 I'VE GOT MY HIGHPOINT OUT THERE
HiPCZZl51Ww_15 I HAVE A SENSE OF HOW FAST IT WOULD BE FROM HALFWAY AND THAT I'VE TRIED APART IT FOR THAT HALFWAY POINT WITH THE RIGHT SPEED
HiPCZZl51Ww_16 A MAKE ALL MY PRACTICE ROWS LOOKING AT THE TARGET
HiPCZZl51Ww_17 AGAIN EIGHTEEN ISN'T NEARLY AS IMPORTANT AS SPEED
HiPCZZl51Ww_18 LOOK AT THE HOLE
HiPCZZl51Ww_19 OH LOOK OF THE HOLE
HiPCZZl51Ww_20 A SET UP TO IT
HiPCZZl51Ww_21 IN THIS OVER NOW
HiPCZZl51Ww_22 I'LL A LOOK A COUPLE MORE TIME JUST TO GET A FEEL FOR HOW FAR IT IS
HiPCZZl51Ww_23 WHEN I BRING THE EYES BACK TO THE BALL I GO AHEAD AND HIT IT
HiPCZZl51Ww_24 THAT'S WHEN THE OVERALL DISTANCES FRESHEST IN MY MIND AND I TEND TO ROLL THE RIGHT SPEED MORE TIMES THE KNOT
gwWmOiC6z4k_1 HI I'M JUDY CARRIER WITH JEWELS BY PARK LANE AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU HOW TO FIND OUT IF THE JEWELRY YOU'RE BUYING ISRAEL
gwWmOiC6z4k_2 THE BIG THING AS ASKER DOCUMENTATION
gwWmOiC6z4k_3 IF IT'S A STONE IS SEE IF THEY HAVE PAPERS OF CERTIFICATION OF TELL YOU THE CARROT
gwWmOiC6z4k_4 IF IT'S OF METAL LOOK FOR A STAMP
gwWmOiC6z4k_5 IF IT IT SUDDEN GOLD LOWERS OF AND YOU SHOULD HAVE TEN CARE OF TEN K FOURTEEN K SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN K TWENTY K ON UP TO TWENTY FOUR K WHICH IS YOUR GOLD
gwWmOiC6z4k_6 YOU KNOW AND THAT IS USUALLY STAMPED ALL IF IT'S A BRACELET IT'LL BEEF INSIDE THE BRACELET USUALLY OR A RAIN IT WILL BE AN INSIDE REIN
gwWmOiC6z4k_7 ON A NECKLACE IT'S USUALLY A I THE CLASS
gwWmOiC6z4k_8 IF IT'S STERLING SILVER IT'S GOING TO BE STAMPED OF POINT NINE TO FIVE STERLING SILVER
gwWmOiC6z4k_9 THAT IS REQUIRED OF TO BE STAMPED ON ANY ITEM THAT STERLING
gwWmOiC6z4k_10 OF THE OTHER THING THAT YOU WANT TO DO TO MAKE SURE IT'S REAL IS OHM HAVE THAT TEST THAT HAVE APPRAISED BY SOMEONE WHO IS AN EXPERT IN THE FIELD
gwWmOiC6z4k_11 ANY REPUTABLE DEALER WILL HAVE A OF WANT LIKE INSTRUMENT THAT HAS A DIAMONDS
gwWmOiC6z4k_12 FOR INSTANCE OF WHAT I WOULD DO THOUGH TO MAKE SURE IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE JEWELER PERSONALLY OR DON'T KNOW IS REPUTATION IS PERHAPS TAKE A PAIR OF OF IN A REALLY GOOD CUBIC ZIRCONIUM EARRINGS AND THE HAVEN'T TEST THE EARRINGS
gwWmOiC6z4k_13 NOW IT SHOULD TURN FROM GREEN ALONG THE SIDE OF THE WANTS TO GO FROM GREEN TO READ IF IT'S REAL IF IT AND IT SHOULD BE
gwWmOiC6z4k_14 IF IT DOESN'T KNOW IF YOU DON'T GET A BEAT ON YOUR CUBIC'S ARE COMING UP BUT YOU DO GET OF THE FRIENDS IS ON YOUR READING AND THAT'S PROBABLY REAL
gwWmOiC6z4k_15 ITS OWN WEIGHT ON AND I WOULD MAKE SURE THEY CAST SOMETHING LIKE THIS FIRST
gwWmOiC6z4k_16 THAT WAY IT WON'T JUST BEAT WHEN THEY WANT TO UP
gwWmOiC6z4k_17 FOR INSTANCE IF YOU DON'T PEARLS ONE WAY TO TEST THAT IS REVAK AS YOUR TEETH
gwWmOiC6z4k_18 IT DOESN'T WORK FROM A HAVE FALSE TEA
gwWmOiC6z4k_19 HOWEVER THEY SAY ALL THAT IF IT'S SMOOTH IT'S PROBABLY FAKE
gwWmOiC6z4k_20 IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE ROUGHER FOR THE REAL PEARLS
gwWmOiC6z4k_21 ALSO CHECK OF WAR OF THE HOLE
gwWmOiC6z4k_22 OF REAL PEARL HAS A VERY TINY BOARD BECAUSE THEY TRY TO OF MAINTAIN THE VALUE OF THE PEARL
gwWmOiC6z4k_23 IT'LL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN HOW OF WAYS
gwWmOiC6z4k_24 WE'LL PEARLS ARE HEAVIER THAN FAKE
gwWmOiC6z4k_25 ANOTHER THING WILL BE THE WARMTH
gwWmOiC6z4k_26 NOW GLANCE PEARLS HOWEVER TAKE A LITTLE LONGER TO WARM UP IN YOUR HAND THAN REAL PEARL
gwWmOiC6z4k_27 SO IT'S STILL A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE THEM UPRIGHT
gFZiilQMutQ_2 THIS IS JON ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gFZiilQMutQ_3 IN THIS VIDEO CLIP I'LL THEORIES GET THROUGH IN A PROCESS OF INSTALLING A BALL VALVE
gFZiilQMutQ_4 THE NEXT THING THAT WE NEED TO DO IS LOCATE A OUR MAIN OF WATER SHUT OFF AND WE NEED TO GO AHEAD AND TURN THAT KNOB
gFZiilQMutQ_5 REMEMBER RIGHTY TIGHTY LEFTY LOOSEY
gFZiilQMutQ_6 THIS IS IN A SHOT OFF THE WATER TO THE ENTIRE HOUSE AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL HAVE TO BE DOING THIS ONCE WE INSTALLER BALL VALVE
gFZiilQMutQ_7 WITH THIS WE OF THE SHOT OFF THAT ALL THE OFF
gFZiilQMutQ_8 THE NEXT THING THAT WE NEED TO DO IS RELIEVE ANY WATER PRESSURE THAT IS STILL IN THE LINES SEEKING GOOD ANY FAUCET WAREHOUSE AND TURN THAT OFF AND LITTLE ALL THAT PRESSURE HAS BEEN RELIEVED FROM THE FAUCET
gFZiilQMutQ_9 WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN IS WHEN WE CUT THE PIPE WE DON'T WANT TO START SPRING WATER EVERYWHERE SO THAT'S WHY WE DO THIS
gVxZwMK5kgc_1 OKAY THE FIRST THING ORGAN UNDO DISLIKE IN THE LAST RECIPE IS CREAM THE BUTTON THE SUGAR
gVxZwMK5kgc_2 SO THIS IS ONE UP ABOUT AN CANOES CAN AND TOSS THAT RED IN THERE AND COOK TOOK IT AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT YOU BAKE WITH SOFTEN BATTER
gVxZwMK5kgc_3 IF YOU HAVE THE TIME TAKE YOUR BLOCK ABOUT OUT LEAVE IT OUT FOR AN HOUR
gVxZwMK5kgc_4 IT SHOULD JUST BE ABLE TO MAKE A FINGERPRINT DISLIKE THAT THAT'S ABOUT HOW SOFT IT SHOULD BE
gVxZwMK5kgc_5 AND YOU CAN ALSO POT HARD THAT AIR IN THE ABS ARE IN THE MICROWAVE FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE SECONDS THIRTY SECONDS IF IT STARTS ALL NOW THEY'LL THEN SNUG IT
gVxZwMK5kgc_6 SEE IT IS ONE OF THE KIT FINGERPRINT SOFT
gVxZwMK5kgc_7 LOOK AT THE END WE'RE GONNA PUT OUR SUGAR IN THIS IS THREE FOURTHS CUT BROWN SUGAR IN WE GO UP AND I'M GOING TO MEASURE OUT THREE FOURTHS CUP WHITE SUGAR IS THE FOURTH OF A CAT
gVxZwMK5kgc_8 SET LIVE ONE FOURTH TWO FOR THE THREE FOURTHS OF AN ORGAN CREAM IT TOGETHER
gVxZwMK5kgc_9 SENA OLD YOU WANTED CREAM THIS ON MEDIUM SPEED FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES
gVxZwMK5kgc_10 IS IT HAS SO IN A LEFT THAT WHILE I HADN'T WIN HALF TIME HATE HAVEN'T HAD IN IF A DRY INGREDIENT HALF
gr3yh_qEPiU_1 AND ON AND THEN ON
gr3yh_qEPiU_2 AND THE SEVEN OVER FOR CHRISTMAS ON IF BETWEEN IN UNISON WITH AS
gr3yh_qEPiU_3 WE'RE HERE ON BEHALF OF <UNK>
gr3yh_qEPiU_4 A GOOD OF A FEAR OF RED SNAP THEM AND ADD THAT THE LOOSE HOLES
gr3yh_qEPiU_5 AND DO THIS WE'RE GOING TO ADD SOME YOGURT
gr3yh_qEPiU_6 AND OF COURSE WE ADDED SOME OF SORT ALREADY IF BUT I THINK OF NEEDS SLIGHTLY LITTLE BIT MORE SORT IN IT
gr3yh_qEPiU_7 THIS IS ALMOST LIKE OFF MY THUMB THE WEAVE BASED OFF AND YOU HAVE YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T HAVE WITH THE LEGAL IN UNTIL YOU CAN EITHER PAN FRY THIS FISH WE CAN EITHER VANITY OF FOOT GET IN THE ALONG FAN FORGIVE EDITING THE ON ROUGH
gr3yh_qEPiU_8 WITH THIS IS REALLY NICE IF THE LEAD THIS
gr3yh_qEPiU_9 YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE ONE DEVICE
gr3yh_qEPiU_10 A FEW TAKES A FEW MINUTES
gr3yh_qEPiU_11 IF YOU GOT ALL THE INGREDIENTS FIX A FEW MINUTES AND IT'S HAVE A VERY NICE FLAVOR
hJ_CfDvv_sw_1 IT'S DOUBLE THE OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPEN VERY RARELY IN THE GAME OF BASEBALL
hJ_CfDvv_sw_2 <UNK> LEFT WE TALK ABOUT THOSE RIGHT NOW
hJ_CfDvv_sw_3 THESE WILL CALL RARE PLACE
hJ_CfDvv_sw_4 THEY CAN BE THINGS LIKE BATTER INTERFERENCE WITH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER HOUSE OR BY RIDING I IN C AND WHAT THIS MEANS IS THE BATTERS WOULD BE THROWN OUT
hJ_CfDvv_sw_5 THIS IS A WAY TO GET OUT IN THE GAME OF BASEBALL MEANING THAT THE BATTER HAS MADE CONTACT WITH THE FIELD
hJ_CfDvv_sw_6 OKAY NOW THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN CATCHER'S INTERFERENCE IN WHICH THE BATTER WOULD ACTUALLY GET HIT
hJ_CfDvv_sw_7 YOU STILL DENOTE DENOTE THAT WITH AND I ANTIQUE BUT YOU DRAW YOUR LINE ADVANCING FROM HOME TO FIRST BASE
hJ_CfDvv_sw_8 THIS IS WHEN THE BATTER SWINGS THE BAT MAKES CONTACT WITH TETRAS GLOVE WITH CATCHES ON THE CATCHER GETS IN THE WAY SOMEHOW OF THE BATTER SO HE DOES GET ON BASE
hJ_CfDvv_sw_9 THAT'S A LIVE AN ODD BALL PLAY
hJ_CfDvv_sw_10 I HIT MY PITCH HAPPENS A LITTLE BIT MORE OFTEN THAN IT SHOULD
hJ_CfDvv_sw_11 THAT MEANS THAT THE PITCHER'S ON ACTUALLY IT FROM THE BALL AND HIT THE BATTER
hJ_CfDvv_sw_12 SOMETIMES THAT HAPPENS INTENTIONALLY
hJ_CfDvv_sw_13 BASEBALL LIKES TO POLICE ITSELF SO SOMETIMES WHEN A BATTER HAS OFF SHOWN A PITCHER ROB WE'RE INSULT OF THE PITCHER AND SOME WHITE VINTAGE OR IN THE NEXT TANNING WILL HIT INTENTIONALLY
hJ_CfDvv_sw_14 SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS ACCIDENTALLY WE STILL DENOTE THAT WITH AN H BEAT P AND HIT BIKE PITCH
hJ_CfDvv_sw_15 THE OTHER THINGS THAT CAN AT COUNT HERE ARE WILD PITCHES WHICH IS OUR WPA
hJ_CfDvv_sw_16 THIS IS WHEN THE PITCHER OF THROWS THE BALL WILDLY OUT OF THE CATCHER'S RAIN
hJ_CfDvv_sw_17 THIS IS NOT CONSIDERED AN ERROR
hJ_CfDvv_sw_18 IT'S DENOTED IN TALLIED SEPARATELY IN BASEBALL
hJ_CfDvv_sw_19 I'M MARK OF THE WPA FROM THE PITCHER ON THE HAND THAT KEPT IN A STATISTICAL CATEGORY
hJ_CfDvv_sw_20 NOW PASSED BALL IS VERY SIMILAR TO A WILD FISH
hJ_CfDvv_sw_21 THAT MEANS THAT THE CATCHER SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT THE BALL BUT DID
hJ_CfDvv_sw_22 THE BALL IS THROWN WITHIN HIS OWN OF CATCHING ABILITY BUT IT SOMEHOW GOT PAST <UNK>
hJ_CfDvv_sw_23 NOW THAT IS COUNT AS AN ERROR
hJ_CfDvv_sw_24 THAT'S THE TWO
hJ_CfDvv_sw_25 ON AND THOSE JUST A FEW OF THE REAR PLAYS IN BASEBALL
hJ_CfDvv_sw_26 YOU WILL SEE HIM OFF AND THAT IS GOOD TO KNOW HOW TO MARK A MOVIE SEE THEM
HBZZ4JMBweA_2 SARAH MCLELLAN AND WE ARE IN NEW YORK CITY

gjexrkXhRQM_7 AS I <UNK>
gjexrkXhRQM_8 HERE I HAVE A LITTLE AT A LOT OF ONEIL
gjexrkXhRQM_9 THIS IS A TATTOO TREAD ALL FOUR OF IN THE EARLY ON IN ON PTO OF MEDICAL BASICALLY IN THIS IS WHAT THIS IS USED FOR
gjexrkXhRQM_10 THE IN COULD BE PUT IN HERE IN A GOOD POUND DOWN FROM THERE STATE I DON'T HAVE THAT WAS ME SEVEN SAY

gjexrkXhRQM_15 <UNK> ON THIS HAS BEEN MODIFIED LITTLE BUT IT'S NOT IS TRADITIONAL FORM IS WE'RE NOT THESE CAMEO BEFORE BUT HERE IS BASICALLY THE TOOL TO APPLY THE INK
gjexrkXhRQM_16 AND THIS HALF OF USES SUCH IN YOU REDUCE CANNA TAVENNER SKIN LIKE THIS

gjexrkXhRQM_19 THE TACK TOWEL MEANS TO TAP LITERALLY AND THAT WAS DONE BY THE MOWERY AND THE POISONS WILL
gjHeEPqP6AY_1 HEY FIRST THING ONE DUAL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LISTENING A IS TALK ABOUT LILIES
gjHeEPqP6AY_2 AND ONCE ALWAYS
gjHeEPqP6AY_3 ALWAYS HAS A LOT OF THINGS
gjHeEPqP6AY_4 BUT THERE'S TWO SPECIFIC KINDS OF THE WAYS THAT REALLY GETS IN OUR WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO BE GOOD LISTENERS INTERNAL LILIES AND THAT EXTERNAL NOISE
gjHeEPqP6AY_6 EXTERNAL NOISE IS THE VASLEV GOES A FIREWIRE HERE YOU KNOW OUTSIDE WHERE A A A HAND A
gjHeEPqP6AY_7 NEXT FACTS TURN ALL NOISE
gjHeEPqP6AY_8 OR MAYBE AIR CONDITIONER KICKS AND YOU'LL THAT KICKS ON
gjHeEPqP6AY_9 OUR HARLEY DAVIDSON MOTORCYCLE DRIVES LIE
gjHeEPqP6AY_10 WHATEVER NO LACES NOW THEY ARE
gjHeEPqP6AY_11 SOMEBODY WALKS IN RIGHT NOW IT'S LANDS THIS DOOR I'VE GOT AN EXTERNAL LAYS THAT'S AFFECTING MY ABILITY TO LISTEN
gjHeEPqP6AY_12 THEN THERE'S AN INTERNAL LILIES
gjHeEPqP6AY_13 INTERNAL OASIS SO ALREADY MY STOMACH IS RUMBLING
gjHeEPqP6AY_14 HI AND SO THEN KILL HARFORD BORROWING MICE LETTER
gjHeEPqP6AY_15 AGAIN IT'S ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
gjHeEPqP6AY_16 OR MAYBE YOU'VE GOT A FIVE HAS AND WHY FOR YOUR BOYFRIEND BROKEN OR WHY FOR YOUR HAS AN ARM QUALITY OF AH
gjHeEPqP6AY_17 MAYBE YOU'RE TIRED MAYBE YOUR COLD TO EACH OF ITS LETTER
gjHeEPqP6AY_18 ANYTHING THAT'S GOING ON INTERNALLY THAT'S EFFECT IN YOU FROM BEING ABLE TO LISTEN
gjHeEPqP6AY_19 OR THESE THINGS CONTROLLABLE WHOLE LOT OF THEM ARE ESPECIALLY THE INTERNAL ONES
gjHeEPqP6AY_20 BUT WE HAVEN'T IT TO A QUICK OR WE CAN LAWHON OUT AND FOCUS
gjHeEPqP6AY_21 FOCUS ON THE MESSAGE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO RECEIPT
gjHeEPqP6AY_22 AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES IS A GOOD LISTENER
hGCrLx07O2M_1 AGAIN WITH YOUR LEGS STRETCHED OUT IN FRONT OF YOU
hGCrLx07O2M_2 AND BEFORE WE GO TO THE NEXT POSE IS WHAT I HAVE A CURVE IN YOUR LOWER BACK
hGCrLx07O2M_3 IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT WHEN MIDI SEATED HIP OPENERS OF FOR EVENTS AND TWIST IT WE CREATE A NATURAL CURVE IN THE LOWER BACK BEFORE WE BEND FORWARD
hGCrLx07O2M_4 SO IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE VERTEBRAE OR YOUR BACK OUR ROUNDING THE BACK BECAUSE YOUR HAMSTRINGS ARE HIGH A OR ABDOMINALS AND TIE A CLEANSING JUST SET OUT ON A PLANE GET OR A GLASS AND TELL HIM GET A CURVE IN YOUR LOWER BACK
hGCrLx07O2M_5 SO GO AHEAD AND DO THAT NOW
hGCrLx07O2M_6 AND THEN FROM THERE UNIT TAKE YOUR LEFT HEEL HALF INTO THE GROIN
hGCrLx07O2M_7 THE LEFT KNEE CAN GO A LITTLE WIDER OUT TO THE SIDE PLACE YOUR FINGER TENNIS OUTSIDE HERE HENCE WITH YOUR INHALATION LENGTHEN YOUR SPINE UP TOWARD THE SKY
hGCrLx07O2M_8 FROM THAT LENGTH ON YOUR EXHALATION TWISTS STORE THE RANGE
hGCrLx07O2M_9 THEN AGAIN INHALE PUSH YOUR FINGERTIPS INTO THE AIR AND AN LENGTHEN YOUR SPINE WAY OF AND FEEL THAT CURVE IN YOUR LOWER BACK AND ALSO THE LOWER VALLEYS LIFTING UP
hGCrLx07O2M_10 BUT ONE MORE GRAPH WE CAN BEGIN TO FOLD FORWARD AND HE'S IN THE STRAP CAN BE REALLY HELPFUL
hGCrLx07O2M_11 SHE CAN TAKE A STRAP AROUND THE BALLS OF YOUR TOE IS AN FOR SOME OF US THAT WE DON'T HAVE A CURVE IN THE LOW BACK WHICH IS LIST STAY UP MAY ACTUALLY STAYING MORE OKRAY AND TRAIN CREATED CURVE WILL GIVE YOU A REALLY GETS TRASH
hGCrLx07O2M_12 ALL OUR IF YOU DO HAVE A CURVE AND GO AHEAD AND START TO FOLD FORWARD
hGCrLx07O2M_13 AS THE FOLD FORWARD YOU CAN PAUL LITTLE BIT ON THE STRAP AND STRETCH FORWARD THREE OR HIGHER
hGCrLx07O2M_14 INHALE THING WITH A HALF
goyXJUwUyCE_1 IN THIS CLIP I'M OR SHE HAD A CHANGE THE SETTINGS ON IMAGINE MASHER CHANNEL AND AUTOMATE SETTINGS IN THE MASTER CHAIR
goyXJUwUyCE_2 SO AGAIN LIKE ALL THESE OTHER OTHER PARAMETERS YOU CAN EDIT VIA THE MIXING OR THE EDITING WINDOW
goyXJUwUyCE_3 THE MIXING WINDOW IS LITTLE HARDER
goyXJUwUyCE_4 IT'S A LITTLE MORE
goyXJUwUyCE_5 IT'S HARD TO BE SMOOTH BECAUSE YOU'RE MOVING IT WITH A MOUSE UNLESS YOU HAVE AN EXTERNAL MIXING INTERFACE
goyXJUwUyCE_6 AND AGAIN YOU HAVE THE REED TOUCH LATCH RIGHT OPTIONS
goyXJUwUyCE_7 AND ANY PLUG IN THAT YOU HAVE ON THE MASTER CHANNEL SAY A COMPRESSION WERE LEAVENING PLUGIN WILL STAY UP STILL BE SHOWN IN THE ACTUAL MASTER CHANNEL ON THE MIXING WINDOW OR THE EDITING WINDOW
goyXJUwUyCE_8 SO THAT YOU CAN STILL DRAW IN IT AND CHANGE VOLUMES ON THE LAST CHANNEL
goyXJUwUyCE_9 RESIDENCY OF THE END OF THIS TRACK I'VE DONE A FADE OUT THE A DRAWING IN ON THE MASHER CHANNEL
goyXJUwUyCE_10 A MAKES A VERY EASY CITY CAN SPECIFIC WE SAY WHEN YOU WANT THE TRACK TO END WHEN YOU WANT THE FADE UP START
goyXJUwUyCE_11 SAME WITH FADE END
goyXJUwUyCE_12 IF AND THINGS LIKE THAT LIVE IN REALLY MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THINGS HAPPENING EXACTLY ONE TO START IN AND WITH A MATCHING
gOjCrsdx9S8_1 I'M KELLY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME TIPS AND TECHNIQUES THAT I USE LAND CONCEALING DARK CIRCLES UNDER THE EYES
gOjCrsdx9S8_2 THERE'S SOME DIFFERENT TOOLS IS YOU CAN USE WHEN YOU'RE APPLYING A CONCEALER
gOjCrsdx9S8_3 OF COURSE A GREAT TOOL IS OLLIE IS VERY ACCESSIBLE TO USE YOUR FINGERS
gOjCrsdx9S8_4 HERE'S ONE MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU ARE WORKING AROUND THE EYE AREA YOU'RE USING JUST YOUR RING FINGER IS THE DON'T COOLER TUG OF THE EYE AREA
gOjCrsdx9S8_5 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT OUR IN JUST AS LATE HIDING MOTION
gOjCrsdx9S8_6 YOU NEVER WANT TO RUB THE CONCEALER IS YOU'RE GOING AND OF RUBBING IT RIGHT OFF
gOjCrsdx9S8_7 USE ONE HAND HIGH IN TO THE SKIN SO IT'LL COVERING IT IT'S A COVER
gOjCrsdx9S8_8 IT COULD ALSO USE A CONCEALER BRUSH WHICH LOOKS LIKE THIS AS A CONCEALER BRUSH IS USUALLY MAIN FROM SYNTHETIC OF BRISTLES IT'LL BE A LITTLE BIT STIFFER SO YOU CAN USE THIS IN A PADDING MOTION TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE COVERAGE
gOjCrsdx9S8_9 OR SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO USE SPONGES THIS IS IS THE ON LATEX RESPONDS WEDGE IN YOU CAN USE THAT TO PAT AND COVER
gOjCrsdx9S8_10 IF YOU HAVE MORE STREAM AREAS THAT YOU NEED A LITTLE BIT HEAVIER COVERAGE ON SOMETIMES A SPONGE WORK A LITTLE BIT BETTER FOR YOU CUT LITTLE HOLD A LITTLE BIT MORE CONCENTRATION OF PRODUCT IN THERE AND THEN YOU CAN PATTERN ON
gOjCrsdx9S8_11 SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE DIFFERENT HEIGHTS OF TOOLS THAT YOU CAN USE WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO CONCEAL AND BASED ON HOW MUCH COVERAGE YOU NEED IT WAR AND WHAT YOU DON'T WANT WORKING WITH THAT LEAD YOU TO ON WHAT TYPE OF TOOL THAT YOU NEED TO USE
gOjCrsdx9S8_12 SO THOSE ARE A FEW OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN APPLY CONCEALER
gPTIs7lGMvM_1 MY NAME IS JARED TODD AND I'M A TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO APPLY YOUR PATTERN TO THE STEEL YOU GET READY TO PROFILE THE BLADE
gPTIs7lGMvM_2 HOW I APPLY MY PATTERNS AS IS AFTER A SKETCH OUT MY PATTERN AND GET IT IS ACCURATELY ON AS POSSIBLE TO WHAT I'VE I WANT ON I HAVE A IT'S A SPRAY ADHESIVE IT'S LIKE LIQUID SCOTCH TAPE IT'S AN CAN
gPTIs7lGMvM_3 NOW MY SPRAY TO THE BACK OF THE PIECE OF PAPER THAT HAVE MY PATTERN ON THIS SIDE AND I STICK IT ON THE STEEL ON TO THAT STOCK ON THERE PRETTY GOOD
gPTIs7lGMvM_4 THEN WHAT I DO ON TWO WATERPROOF THE PAPER SO THAT IT DOESN'T WHERE WAY WHAM GRINDING IS I'VE FOUND THAT ON IN THE HARDWARE STORE ON THERE'S A WOOD HARTNER ME MY MEN WICK ON THAT I'M I JUST PUT A COUPLE COATS ON HERE AND HARDEN SEALS IT FROM ON FROM WATER
gPTIs7lGMvM_5 THE KNIFE DOES GET HOT ONLY GRANITE TWENTY TO DUMP DIP IT IN WATER SYNDICATE COOLANT THEM
gPTIs7lGMvM_6 SOME PEOPLE DON'T USE THIS TYPE OF TECHNIQUE
gPTIs7lGMvM_7 THEY USE ON THEY GET THIS IT'S A BLUE TYPE OF PAINT
gPTIs7lGMvM_8 IT'S A LAYOUT OF PAINT
gPTIs7lGMvM_9 THEY PAINTING ON PIECES STEEL THAT THEY WANT LOCATER PATTERN DOWN AND THEN THEY'LL USE ON A METAL SCRIBE OR SHARP OBJECT AND THEY'LL SCRIBE THROUGH THE PAINT ON TO THE STEEL
gPTIs7lGMvM_10 SUNK PREFER THAT OTHER THEN USING THE PAPER METHOD
gPTIs7lGMvM_11 I FIND THAT THE PAPER METHOD WORKS THE BEST FOR ME ON BECAUSE ONCE I GET MY PATTERN DRAWN OUT I GO TO THE COPY CENTER AND I'M MAKING A AS MANY COPIES AS I NEED
gPTIs7lGMvM_12 THE DISADVANTAGES OF IT IS THAT YOU KNOW IT WILL WEAR OFF ON IF YOU RUN ON IT TOO HARD
gPTIs7lGMvM_13 BUT IT COMES RIGHT OFF WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH YOUR KNIFE
gPTIs7lGMvM_14 YOU CAN PEEL IT OFF
gPTIs7lGMvM_15 I'M OR SOME PEOPLE JUST TAKE A MARKER AND I'LL JUST DRAW ON THEIR PATTERN RIGHT ON THE STEEL
gPTIs7lGMvM_16 JUST BY HAND
gPTIs7lGMvM_17 AND HOW EVERYONE INTO IT THERE'S NO WRONG WAY
gPTIs7lGMvM_18 I JUST FOUND THAT THIS WAY WORKS THE BEST WHAT I NEED

GGh8knFY2rw_4 OFF LINE IS ALWAYS
GGh8knFY2rw_5 THE SOMEONE ATTACK THE INSIDE OF THE FOREARM
GGh8knFY2rw_6 WHY NATURALLY EM
GGh8knFY2rw_7 NOW MOST AN ATTACK THE WRISTS AS WELL
GGh8knFY2rw_8 ALL THE SIMULTANEOUS
GGh8knFY2rw_9 ALL THE SEEDS PRETTY PHYSICALLY COMPLICATED TO DEGREE
GGh8knFY2rw_10 BUT I WANT TO KEEP IT GET THE MOTIONS NICE SHORTEN SWEET TO THE POINT
GGh8knFY2rw_11 MY GOAL IS TO STRIKE THIS HERE

hCvNibEfOOM_1 HI THIS IS SEAN HOBSON
hCvNibEfOOM_2 WELL WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE A SMALL FORWARD IS AND POWER FORWARD IS
hCvNibEfOOM_3 BEFORE POSITION IS USUALLY A LITTLE BIT BIGGER OF A PLAYER THAT WE USE FOR OUR GUARDS
hCvNibEfOOM_4 OUR POINT GUARD TYPICALLY ONE OF THE SMALLER GUYS ALL IN THE OFF IN THE INNER SHOOTING GUARDS OR USE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER
hCvNibEfOOM_5 BUT OUR FORWARDS AGAIN BE THE BIG GUYS YOU WANNA CONCENTRATE ON A SMALL FOR BEING A BEING DOLLAR THAT CAN SHOOT
hCvNibEfOOM_6 SO FOR EXAMPLE WE GOT KYLE HERE WHO IS A TALLER PLAYER IN JUST A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN OUR POST PLAYERS BUT THE SAME TIME IS A GOOD OUTSIDE SHOOTER
hCvNibEfOOM_7 SO WE CAN USE THEM OUT ON THE WING AS AN OUTSIDE SHOOTER WHAT WE CALL THE SMALL FOR POSITION WHICH IS ACTUALLY LIKE ANOTHER BIG GUARD
hCvNibEfOOM_8 SOME OFTEN SAYS RUN OF THREE GUARD SET SO INSTEAD OF HAVING A SMALL FORWARD THERE THAT HAVE ANOTHER GUARD
hCvNibEfOOM_9 SO OUR POWER FORWARDS POPPING IT IS BASICALLY YOUR TEAM IS BLAST LIKE OURS IS WE HAVE A LOT OF BIG POST PLAYERS THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE TWO PLAYERS THAT MIGHT BE CENTERS ONE AS A POWER FORWARD AND WANT AS A CENTER
hCvNibEfOOM_10 BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO ARE A POWER FORWARD IS GET A BIG GUY THAT CAN POST UP BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE CAN SHOOT FROM THE OUTSIDE AS WELL
hCvNibEfOOM_11 SO REALLY USE HIM AS A VERSATILE ROLL WHERE A CENTER IS MORE OF A GUY THAT JUST GET A PLANNER NEAT AND HE'S GOT A POST UP AND AGAIN REBOUND UNDERNEATH
hCvNibEfOOM_12 WITH THIS GUY HAS BEEN WILL MORE VERSATILE
hCvNibEfOOM_13 WE'RE IN RUN HIM FROM SIDE TO SIDE THEN RUN HIM OFF SUNSCREEN ALIGN BECOME THE HIGH POST AREA SHOES WELL
hCvNibEfOOM_14 SO WE GOT OUR POWER FORWARD WITH BLADE DOWN LOW MOST AND NOT IN OUR SMALL FORWARDS WHICH IT IN A FLAT ON THE PERIMETER FOR
hCvNibEfOOM_15 THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO FORWARD ROLLS

gRjrl0hi1_A_1 HI I'M JOHN SEXTON ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gRjrl0hi1_A_2 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE LEARNING HOW TO PLAY PORTAL A GAME BY VALVE SOFTWARE A COMPANY WITH WHICH I HAVE NO AFFILIATION
gRjrl0hi1_A_3 SO IF THIS WAS A VERY DIFFICULT HOWSELL <UNK> OWN NOT I CONCEPTUALLY DAY IS DIFFICULT AT HIM
gRjrl0hi1_A_4 SO WHAT WE DID WAS I ADD A LITTLE THAT WENT DOWN COME IN THE BOTTOM OF THAT HAS ON THAT YOU CAN SEE RIGHT HERE AND THE ENTRANCE HERE AND WE JUMP IN THE CHASM AND CAME OUT OF HERE WHICH LUNTZ'S HIGH ENOUGH IN THE AIR TO BE ABLE TO SHOOT A PORTAL DOWN ON THAT THE SPOT FOR
gRjrl0hi1_A_5 THEN WHEN WE FELL BACK INTO THIS ONE WE CAME OUT OF THIS ONE
gRjrl0hi1_A_6 I'M WITH SHOT ANOTHER PORTAL AND HERE AND THEN WE WENT BACK INTO THIS PORTAL AND POP OUT OF THIS ONE
gRjrl0hi1_A_7 IN THE SAME THING OF FROM HERE TO HERE AND THEN WE DID THE SAME THING FROM HERE TO HERE AND THAT LAUNCH THIS ACROSS TO THIS A SPACE
gRjrl0hi1_A_8 THINK FULLY WE'RE DONE WITH THAT VERY DISORIENTING PUZZLE AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF THIS TEST CHAMBER
GDRGPctnjW4_1 VISION'S OFTEN ASKED ME HOW IS IT THAT THE SPINE RELATES TO THE CENTER OF THE AND HAVING HOW'S IT THAT THE SPINE THESE BONES ON HER CREATING PAIN OR SOME KIND OF DYSFUNCTION ANIME QUITE UNDERSTAND
GDRGPctnjW4_2 WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO THAT THAT THE SPINE IS REALLY THE HOUSE THAT PROTECTS THE NERVES AT A TRANSMITTING THESE MESSAGES AND SO AS THE SPINE IS MISALIGNED AS THE SPINE BECOMES TORTE TWISTED WHAT HAVE YOU IT PUTS PRESSURE ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT THEN ASCENDING THE MESSAGES OUT AND WHICH CAN BE PAIN HER FUNCTION
GDRGPctnjW4_3 SOME PAINT VIBRATING AFFECTED THERE IN A FILL PAIN WITH AS BURNING RADIATING PAINT LOCAL PAIN HOW MUSCLE TENSION PRESSURE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS
GDRGPctnjW4_4 ADDITIONALLY AS DIMENSION OF THEIR FUNCTION FIBERS AS WELL AND IN THIS DIAGRAM HERE AGAIN THE BRAIN IS UP HERE THIS IS THE SPINE THE CORD IS COMING DOWN THROUGH AND THERE'S DIFFERENT FIBERS ARE COMING OUT THE DIFFERENT LEVELS IN THE SHOWS VERY WELL SOME OF THE SYSTEMIC RESPONSIBILITIES SOAP TOPPING INTERESTING THINGS LIKE THE EYES THE TONGUE CELERY GLANCE COMING DOWN TO THE MIDDLE OF THE HEART YOU HAVE THE LONG THIS FOR THE DOWNLOADING WAS STOMACH SOME KIDNEYS AND INTESTINAL DIGESTIVE THINGS OF BLADDER FUNCTIONS DOWN HERE
GDRGPctnjW4_5 SO THE LOWER BACK YOU CAN SEE THAT PRETTY MUCH THE AREA WHICH THINGS ARE IN THE BLADDER DIGESTIVE ORGANS THESE THINGS CAN BE EFFECTIVE
GDRGPctnjW4_6 SO OF AGAIN SYSTEMICALLY THERE'S A GREAT CORRELATION TO LOW BACK AND HOW THINGS WORK AS WELL AS WITH PAIN

H46ZsPX3n9s_6 SOMETIMES IT'S WHERE YOU NEED TO I INCREASE DEDUCTIBLES TO LOWER YOUR PREMIUMS OR YOU WANNA INCREASE YOUR LIMITS BECAUSE NETTY FEEL LIKE YOUR EXPOSURE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO BODILY INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE YOUR UNINSURED MOTORIST WHICH IS A BIG THING
H46ZsPX3n9s_7 THE ADVANTAGE OR A CAR ACCIDENT WITH SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T HAVE CAR INSURANCE THAT WE'RE UNINSURED MOTORS WOULD COME IN AND THOSE LIMITS COULD GO ANYWHERE FROM TEN TWENTY OLLIE UP TO A MILLION DOLLARS OF SO AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF ART RISK THAT YOU CURRENTLY FEEL IT IN HALF AND JUST THAT COMFORT ZONE OR THAT LEVEL OF COMFORT WHICH ONE MAKE SURE THAT IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT YOU PROPERLY IN SHORT
H46ZsPX3n9s_8 MY NAME IS JAMES WITH THE RESURGENCE GROUP WE SPECIALIZE IN AUTO INSURANCE AND THE ONE THING THAT WE REALLY TRY AND STRESS IS THAT IT'S NICE TO HAVE AN AGENT THAT YOU CAN GO IN AND SEE AND SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS WITH THEM ALL OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS OVER THE YEARS THAT CHANGE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE PROPER INSURANCE ON ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU NEED IT AND IT'S WHEN THEY HAVE THAT LOSS AND YOU HAVE AN ACCIDENT ANYONE MAKE SURE THAT YOU PROPERLY COVERED

GFKMytY-yjA_1 ONE THING THAT YOU NEED TO REMEMBER ABOUT TELLING THE WHOLE CROUT WHAT YOUR PLATFORM IS IS THAT YOU NEED TO STAND UP STRAIGHT AND HAVE GOOD POSTURE AND WHATEVER YOU DO HAVE EYE CONTACT WITH THE JUDGES IN THE CROWD SO THAT YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE VERY CONFIDENT AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
GFKMytY-yjA_2 NOW I'M GOING TO BACK TRACK AND TELL YOU HOW TO PREPARE YOUR PLATFORM STATEMENT STARTING WITH STEP ONE
GFKMytY-yjA_3 OUR WHO HAVE HALF HAM HOCK THE FIRST
GFKMytY-yjA_4 AND ONE A TALK ABOUT IS HOW TO CHOOSE A PLATFORM
GFKMytY-yjA_5 IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH COMMUNITY SERVICE OR YOU'RE VERY PASSION ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE THAT'S REALLY A PLUS FOR FINDING WHAT YOUR PLATFORM IS GOING TO BE
GFKMytY-yjA_6 YOU NEED TO CHOOSE A TOPIC THAT YOU HAVE INTEREST IN AND STEADY IT AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC AREA
GFKMytY-yjA_7 SOME EXAMPLES OF SOME PLATFORMS ARE PREVENTION OF HOMELESSNESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF FINER SLUDGE OCCASION AND UNDERAGE DRINKING
h7XT7qhKU1Q_1 SOME OF TALK A LITTLE BIT LOWER AND THE LIGHT HERE RATHER AND IN THE DARKROOM ABOUT REALLY JUST WHAT A CONTACT SHEET IS
h7XT7qhKU1Q_2 CONTACT SHEET IS OR NEGATIVES NEW LAY THEM ON TOP OF A PIECE OF PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPER THE DARKER
h7XT7qhKU1Q_3 AND THEN AFTER THE NEGATIVE ON TOP OF THE PAPER IN A TAKE A SHEET OF GLASS ART CONTACT SHEET PRINTER
h7XT7qhKU1Q_4 BUT AGAIN THE MOST AFFORDABLE LETTUCE IS USE A NICE QUARTER INCH THICK SHEET OF GLASS
h7XT7qhKU1Q_5 WHAT YOU DO IS YOU LAY DOWN ON TOP OF THE PAPER
h7XT7qhKU1Q_6 LIGHT FROM THE LARGER EXPOSES JUST THROUGH YOUR NEGATIVES AND ON TO THE PAPER
h7XT7qhKU1Q_7 REALLY PRETTY SIMPLE
h7XT7qhKU1Q_8 BUT FOR SOME REASON FUN OF IT'S THE TIME FACTOR THING
h7XT7qhKU1Q_9 I FOUND IT I INTERFERING WITH AN A LOT OF MY STUDENTS FLY TO JUST LOOK AT THEIR NEGATIVES ON A LIGHT TABLE AND PRINT FROM THEM
h7XT7qhKU1Q_10 AND I CAN CAN TREND TALK PEOPLE I THAT ENOUGH
h7XT7qhKU1Q_11 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WAY YOU PHOTOGRAPH ON A CONTACT SHEET YOU'LL SEE THE RHYTHM AND OR PHOTOGRAPHY
h7XT7qhKU1Q_12 YOU'LL ACTUALLY SEE THE WING RIGHT LOOKS
h7XT7qhKU1Q_13 AND IT'S AMAZING LEARNING TOOL YOU JUST KEEP MAKING CONTACT SHEETS AND JUST LOOKING ON THAT WAY
HaQ-wgHagyg_1 SO WE LEARN FOR BASIC IT'S FUN KICK SIDE KICK BACK KICK AND ROUND HOUSE KICK
HaQ-wgHagyg_2 THOSE ARE THE TRADITIONAL KICKS IN OKAY NOW
HaQ-wgHagyg_3 WHEN I WENT TO JAPAN AND WHEN THE KOREANS ADDED THERE'S THEY BECAME COUNTLESS OTHER VARIATIONS
HaQ-wgHagyg_4 AS YOU COULD PROBABLY TELL WITH THE HUMAN LAMB THERE'S ALMOST IN INFINITE NUMBER WAYS YOU CAN MOVE IT
HaQ-wgHagyg_5 INFINITE NUMBER COMBINATIONS YOU CAN COME UP WITH
HaQ-wgHagyg_6 THE ONLY THING STOPPING IS THE HUMAN MINE
HaQ-wgHagyg_7 SO SOME VARIATIONS ARE INTELLECT OF YET CRESCENT KICK WITH A KICK COMES OUT AND IT COMES OUT SLAPPING ON THE SIDE SIDE THAT
HaQ-wgHagyg_8 PRESSING KEGS HEATING GO FROM THE OTHER WAY
HaQ-wgHagyg_9 IF YOU ADD A SPINDLE THAT IT'S A LITTLE A IT'S EASIER TO ACTUALLY GENERALLY LOW BUT MORE POWERFUL SPIN WAS THAT INTO THE PRESENCE
HaQ-wgHagyg_10 FROM THERE YOU ALSO HAVE JUMPY GETS LIKE ABS CAN SHOW YOU JUST JUMPING FRONT KICK
HaQ-wgHagyg_11 IT IS AT A JUMP TO IT FROM THE GET EVEN DOUBLE POWER
HaQ-wgHagyg_12 NO DUG JUMPING SIDEKICK THEM WHICH IS EASIER RUN ACTUALLY LEAD INTO SOMETHING
HaQ-wgHagyg_13 BUT THESE ARE JUST DIFFERENT VARIATIONS EVEN COME UP WITH
HaQ-wgHagyg_14 AND PROBABLY SEEN ESPECIALLY IN THE KOREAN SOUTH LIKE TAEKWONDO TONGS AND LOW
HaQ-wgHagyg_15 THEY LIKE TO DO A LOT OF HIGH SPINNING KITS THAT REALLY SPECTACULAR THAT THEY TAKE A LOT MORE YEARS TO MASTER
HaQ-wgHagyg_16 SO FROM HERE OF WOULDN'T WANT TO THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF CUT THEY LIKE POT THAT SPARRING AND SOME WEAPONS
h28nu6dOPEw_1 A KING AT OF CUT MY LITTLE PIECES OF RED IN WHAT A MINUTE PUT A MY FRAME I NEED TO DECIDE WHAT I'M THE KNEES TO PUT ON THERE AND MAKE A GOOD HERE
h28nu6dOPEw_2 AND AT THIS I LOSE STICKERS CAN WORK BEST FOR THIS PROJECT HAS REUSING GLASS IN THIS RIBBON OF MATERIAL AND THAT IS THE WORK FAST
h28nu6dOPEw_3 I'M WORKING WITH THE GLUE IS THAT CAN SOMETIMES BE A LITTLE BIT TRICKY BECAUSE SOME HAS WAS STICKS CLUMP AND SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE USING A CERTAIN DIRECTION A THE RIBBON SIXTEEN GATHER SO YOU CAN DO IS PLACE OR THING OR ON ONE END AND PUSH AWAY FROM YOURSELF WITH THE GLUE STICK
h28nu6dOPEw_4 GO AWAY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND JUST KEEP YOUR FINGER NO NEAR AND PUT LIKE THAT
h28nu6dOPEw_5 AND ACTUALLY PUT THE GLUE ON FIRST AND WE'RE PUTTING THE RIBBONS ON THIS SIDE ON THE FRAME FIRST
h28nu6dOPEw_6 AND YOU CAN MOVE AROUND A LITTLE BIT AND PUSH IN A PLACE OF UP TO MAKE SURE AS THE FIRST ONE OVER ON THE SIDE
h28nu6dOPEw_7 AND YOU START FROM ONE END AND JUST PRESS LIGHTLY TO MAKE IT STICK TO THE FRAME
h28nu6dOPEw_8 AND NOW AND DO OUR NEXT ONE AND PLACE IT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE I'M AND THE REASON WHY WE'RE PUTTING IT ON THE EACH OF THE SITES FIRST IS BECAUSE THEN WHEN WE PUT OUR RIBBON ON THE TOP IT'S CAN A CROSSOVER AND MAKE A NICE CLEAR OWNER AND I LIKE WHEN CORNERS OR I LOOK ALL THAT WE'VE PLANTED OUT EVERY HALF
h28nu6dOPEw_9 HERE WE GO AND YOU WOULDN'T DO TO ONE OF THE POT AND WHILE I PUT THIS SONG WILL START GETTING READY FOR OUR NEXT PROJECT
h28nu6dOPEw_10 LEAVE IN THE POLISH AND LIVE AND
h28nu6dOPEw_11 AND START TO LOOK GOOD ALREADY OUT LIKE IT
h28nu6dOPEw_12 STAY TUNE WILL BE COMING UP WITH THE NEXT EMBELLISHING IN A SECOND

GMerrbORnbk_1 NEXT WISH A WHAT'S CALLED A FRONT NOLIE FRONTSIDE ONE EIGHTY
GMerrbORnbk_2 REMEMBER AN OLLIE IS WHEN YOU'RE RIDING AND IN THE SWITCH POSITION BUT FAKIE WHICH MEANS PRETTY MUCH RIDING BACKWARDS SO IT CAN BE ARE OPPOSITE FEED ON THIS ONE'S WITHIN FEEL DIFFICULT THAT FIRST BUT NO EVENTUALLY YOU BECOME A LITTLE BIT AMBIDEXTROUS THAT WILL FEEL SO WEIRD BUT WHEN YOU RE TRYING TO DO THIS ONE HAVE AN OLLIE PRETTY MUCH DOWN PAT BECAUSE THE FOUNDATION TO THE WHOLE TRICK
GMerrbORnbk_3 YOU'LL BE THIS BEAD STOMP ON THE NOSE AS A STOMP SPIN YOUR BODY THE DIRECTION THE ONE A TURN AND ON THIS AN OLLIE FRIENDS THAT ONE EIGHTY HAS BEEN WHERE YOU CAN SEE WE'RE TURNING THE MAKING IT EASIER OF THE TWO FOOT WITH WHEN YOU INCORPORATE THE PUSHING IN RIDING AROUND IN ALL THE OTHER PARTS OF THE AN OLLIE ONE EIGHTY HOT AND PUTTING TOGETHER IT LOOKS A LITTLE LESS
gs-L3zz_KDM_1 A BIT OF NAIL
gs-L3zz_KDM_2 THEY'LL IS THE STRONGEST WEAPON THAT YOU HAVE IN THE GAME OF SPADES
gs-L3zz_KDM_3 BY THE WAY THERE IS ANOTHER BID CALLED LINE NIL OR DOUBLE NAILS
gs-L3zz_KDM_4 DOUBLE NAIL IS A BID DESIGN PRIMARILY AND IT'S NOT THIS HAND THE DOT DOUBLE NOSE DESIGN PRIMARILY TO HELP RESCUE A LAST GAME
gs-L3zz_KDM_5 IN OTHER WORDS YOU LOSING BY TWO HUNDRED POINTS AND YOU THROW IT WAS CALLED YOU THROW OUT WILL HIT THAT IS WHEN YOU THROW OUT WHAT'S CALLED A BLIND MEAL
gs-L3zz_KDM_6 LINE NAILED NAIL FORGET THE SAND FOR THE MOMENT SUPPOSING THAT THIS WAS A HAND OR WHEN YOU GET A BLIND THEY'LL YOU'RE TELLING THE COMPUTER THAT ARE NOT LOOK TO HAND THE TRIPLE CRUCIAL DON'T HAVE THE ACE OF SPADES IN HAND
gs-L3zz_KDM_7 BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE THE ACE OF SPADES OR A BED ACE AND HANDED AND GET SET INSTANTLY
gs-L3zz_KDM_8 THAT WOULD YOU DON'T GET TO SEE A CARDS BUT TO MAKE THIS A TENT TO TAKE TWO HUNDRED POINTS IN THE FUTURE IN A HANDLE WHAT <UNK> YOGA SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS ALL MY GOD I'M SET
gs-L3zz_KDM_9 I CANNOT MAKE THIS NAIL
gs-L3zz_KDM_10 SO ON I DON'T EVEN PLAY GAMES OF LINE MILLS
gs-L3zz_KDM_11 WE DON'T ALLOW THEM IN THE TOURNAMENTS AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ON LINE DON'T LIKE TO USE THEM BECAUSE ON NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE AGAIN STOLEN FROM THEM BECAUSE SOMEBODY AN INCREDIBLY LUCKY
gs-L3zz_KDM_12 SO THE BLIND NIL BID THAT IS A BIT OF DESPERATION
gs-L3zz_KDM_13 A STANDARD NAIL WE WANT TO WITH ONE HUNDRED POINTS IF YOU SUCCESSFULLY MAKE THAT BID
gs-L3zz_KDM_14 NOW LET'S LOOK AT THIS HAND
gs-L3zz_KDM_15 YOU DO HAVE THE ACE OF CLUBS WHICH YOU HAVE THREE SMALL ONE SO THE PROBABILITY OF YOU'RE MAKING THIS GOOD A PRETTY GOOD
gs-L3zz_KDM_16 PARTICULARLY SINCE YOU HAVE A DEUCE IN THE FIVE IN IN THE EIGHT
gs-L3zz_KDM_17 I MEAN CHANCES ARE THE OPPONENTS ON DON'T WHETHER THIS BUILT DOES BID WOULD BE SET WITH HIS ACES THAT ONE A POINT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE KING QUEEN JACK CAN OR SOMETHING OF THAT OLD
gs-L3zz_KDM_18 THE UPRIGHT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE ONE LITTLE SPOTS AND HE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE ONE AVOIDING IS KEEP FOLLOWING THROUGH THE RATE
gs-L3zz_KDM_19 CHANCES ARE THAT ON YOUR PARTNER WILL BE TRUMPING OF WITH ROUNDER THIS SUIT
gs-L3zz_KDM_20 THIS SIDE SUIT IS COMPLETELY SAFE
gs-L3zz_KDM_21 SINGLETON DIAMOND IS GOOD
gs-L3zz_KDM_22 THE ONLY RISK FACTOR IN THE SNOW WAS THIS TENNIS SPADES
gs-L3zz_KDM_23 EFFECT THAT YOU HAVE TO SMALLEST PHASE WHERE THAT IS VERY ENCOURAGING BECAUSE EITHER YOUR PARTNER COULD HAVE THE JACK QUEEN KING OR ACE OF SPADES WHICH IS ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT PROBABILITY
gs-L3zz_KDM_24 AND THIS IS ONLY PROBABILITIES IN THE GAME
gs-L3zz_KDM_25 BY THE WAY THE HIGHER YOUR PARTNER BIDS A MORE LIKELY THAT HE HAS WOULD DROP
gs-L3zz_KDM_26 VIBRATOS BIDDING SIX

gVJ43IgwhT4_2 THEY CAN BASICALLY PLUG A PEDAL STEEL GUITAR AND ANY ELECTRIC GUITAR AMPLIFIER BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE BETTER SUITED TO THE TONE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A PEDAL STEEL
gVJ43IgwhT4_3 AND I THINK THE PHILOSOPHY ONE MOST STEEL PLAYERS IS THAT YOU WON'T HAVE A LOT OF VERY CLEAN POWER AND IF YOU GOTHENBURG IT UP WITH A FAXON DISTORTION AND WHATNOT YOU WON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THAT
gVJ43IgwhT4_4 I KNOW THERE'S THOSE WHO ARE PURIST SELECTIVELY THROUGH AMPLIFIERS WITH TWO HANDS

HG9mwh7aAfM_1 OKAY WELL CORONAL POLISHING IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO
HG9mwh7aAfM_2 SO WHAT IT DOES IS IT TAKE IT CLEANS ALL IT'S HARDER AND CALCULUS FROM THE GUM LINE OF THE TOOTH ALL THE WAY TO THE TIP OF THE TOOTH
HG9mwh7aAfM_3 THE GUM ONE OF THE TIP OF THE TOOTH IS CALLED A CROWN OR THE CORONAL THUS THAN INCREMENT POLISH
HG9mwh7aAfM_4 AND WHAT HAPPENS IS IS WHEN A PERSON JUST THREW DATED A WEAR AND TEAR EATING DRINKING YOU NOW BREATHING THEY START BUILDING UP ACCESS BACTERIA AND HARDER AND CALCULUS ON THESE TEETH THAT AS BRUSHING AND FLOSSING ALONE WILL NOT REMOVE
HG9mwh7aAfM_5 SO OBVIOUSLY THE BENEFITS FOR CORONAL POLISHING IS TO REMOVE THIS AND ALSO HAVE A BETTER FOUNDATION FOR SOME SUPER DO FOR HELP THE GUMS
HG9mwh7aAfM_6 NOW MOST THE TIME AND DON'T DENTIST OR DENTAL HYGIENE IT'S WILL DO THE CORONAL POLISHING
HG9mwh7aAfM_7 THE MOST PEOPLE USUALLY HAVE TO GET IT DONE ONCE EVERY SIX MONTHS SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE TO GET IT OF MORE TIMES BECAUSE GENETICALLY THEY BUILD UP OF OF MORE OF A BACTERIA AND THEY HAVE TUTEN EVERY THREE MINDS OLD ONE MONTH
HG9mwh7aAfM_8 THIS IS THE TIME YOU CAN PLAY NEW MOTHER AND FATHER BECAUSE THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S A NEW JEANS THAT YOU HAVE TO BUILD UP THIS TARTAR CONTROLLED EVERYTHING OUNCE LIKE THAT
HG9mwh7aAfM_9 SO THAT'S WHAT THE FOUNDATION IS AN CHROME PODGE
gLn7ARrCQ6w_1 ONCE YOU'VE REALLY LEARN HOW TO RIDE FAKIE VERY WELL ALL THE SUDDEN YOU HAVE A WHOLE NEW OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT TRICKS

gLn7ARrCQ6w_3 NO MUCH LIKE A BUNNY HOP MOST PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO DO ONE EIGHTIES THINKING OF BOTH HEELS OF THE SAME TIME AND WHIPPING THE BIKE AROUND AS FAST AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN AND LANDING BACKWARDS
gLn7ARrCQ6w_4 IT'S REALLY IS NOT THE OPTIMAL WAY TO DO IT BECAUSE THEN ONCE AGAIN ONCE YOU START I TAKE IT TO MORE ADVANCED STAGES OF DOING ONE EIGHTIES FOR EXAMPLE ONE ONE EIGHTY DOWNSTAIRS OR YOU ARE WANT ONE EIGHTY OVER A JUMP SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU HAVE A LOT LESS CONTROL OVER THE TRICK
gLn7ARrCQ6w_5 SO BASICALLY KNOW WHAT YOU WANT A START TAKING YOUR ONE EIGHTIES TO ALL SORTS OF NEW AVENUES THAT YOU THAT YOU HAD A REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT BEFORE WATER MAKE SURE THAT MUCH LIKE A BUNNY HOP YOUR ONE EIGHTY START WITH YOUR FRONT WHEEL COMING UP
gLn7ARrCQ6w_6 WHAT YOU WANT TO START LOOKING AT YOUR INSIDE SHOULDER WHICHEVER WAY YOU NATURALLY ONE A SPIN AND AS YOU AS YOU COME IN YOU POP AND YOU PUSH THE BIKE THROUGH <UNK> AT BUT YOU MAKE SURE TO KEEP LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER BECAUSE YOUR TO YOUR BODY BASE WE WILL FALL AWARE EVERY LOOK SO AS LONG AS YOU KEEP LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LAND JUST FINE
gLn7ARrCQ6w_7 IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SPEND A COMPLETE ONE EIGHTY BECAUSE ONCE YOU START LEARNING AND YOU'LL CARRY MUCH BETTER SPEED RIDING OUT BACKWARDS IF YOU SPIN IT REALLY A COMPLETE ONE EIGHTY RATHER THAN SPINNING NO HUNDREDS SIXTY DEGREES OR SO WHERE YOU BASICALLY ARE GOING TO LAND IN A COMPLETE STOP

GVMmatnTe_Q_6 AFTER YOU MIX IT HOW YOU LET IT SIT FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES
GVMmatnTe_Q_7 BECAUSE IT IS A CON FREEZE IT HAS TO HAVE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT HAS TO HAPPEN SO OFFENSE AND SET UP FOR A FEW MINUTES
GVMmatnTe_Q_8 ONCE YOU'VE GOT A SET UP THAT WAY YOU WANT F AND YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY HAS IN A LITTLE THIN VELVET MORPH FULL HOT FAT ALL THE LOFT OUT LET IT SET
GVMmatnTe_Q_9 YOU CAN DO THIS WHILE YOU'RE IN YOUR FINAL THIS DESIGN STAGE SO IT'S ALL READY TO GO
GVMmatnTe_Q_10 AFTER IT SETS UP I TAKE AN OIL OF BUTTER NINE IF ANY TAKE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF GLUE PICK UP THE TILE LITTLE PIECE OF GLUE OF THE THINSET

GVMmatnTe_Q_14 IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH WAY YOU DO IT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A GOOD ADHESION WITH THE TILE
GVMmatnTe_Q_15 THEN YOU LET AT HEAVE GLUE TO HOLD PIECE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING THE WAY YOU WANT IT YOU HAVE TO LET IT SIT IN HERE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS
GVMmatnTe_Q_16 REMEMBER TO MIX THE THINSET LET IT SET UP FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES THEN REMIX THAT

hbq9TOm0q5s_1 HONEY KILL FLEAS
hbq9TOm0q5s_2 WELL THERE ARE LOTS OF ARE WAYS TO KILL FLEA IS A HOME THAT A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE AND EASILY OF EASILY I'VE GOTTEN A LOCAL PET STORE
hbq9TOm0q5s_3 UM UP ON MY CARD HERE I HAVE OT COUPLE EXAMPLES ON THERE'S OR TOPICAL OINTMENTS A WHICH ARE MY PREFERRED USAGE FOREVER OCTILLION PREVENTING FLEAS
hbq9TOm0q5s_4 I'M GOING VERY BAD INFESTATIONS THESE HAVE TO BE USED IN CONJUNCTION OR WITH THINGS LIKE THE POT POWDERS IN THE AIR A SMALL TALL SPRAYS IN THE BOMBS
hbq9TOm0q5s_5 I AM I DO NOT FOR THE BOMBS MYSELF ON THE THEY WORK ALL THAT WELL AND ARE COUNTING ENSURES OF IN YOUR HOME THAT LOSS OF IS DUE TO DO A BOMB ON
hbq9TOm0q5s_6 THE AEROSOL SPRAYS ARE MUCH MUCH MORE DIRECT YOU CAN GET THEM EXACTLY THE PLACES WANNA GET THEM ON AND DIE AND AND THAT THEY'RE EASY CONTROL AND USE AS OUR THE POWDERS
hbq9TOm0q5s_7 BUT YOUR FIRST LINE OFFENSES GOOD BE SOME SORT OF TOPICAL OINTMENT

hbq9TOm0q5s_14 I PREFER THE FRONT LANOLIN BROUGHT BRAND FRONTLINE BRAND THEY DO WORKS THE BEST IN MY OPINION OVER THE YEARS ON HIM THEY THEY OUT CAUSE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF ALL OF THAT THAT HAVE EVER HAD ANY BAD REACTION ON THE FRONT LINE
hbq9TOm0q5s_15 BUT JUST TO WEAR THESE ALL ALL ARE ALL PESTICIDE RIGHT ONE FORM ANOTHER AND YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN USING THEM ON ESPECIALLY WITH THE TOPICAL OINTMENTS
hbq9TOm0q5s_16 ONCE YOU'VE USED TOPICAL OINTMENT I'LL WHETHER IT WORKS OR NOT YOU CAN NOT APPLY TO ONE FOR THE MONTH

GSX_5gNCnRo_1 I FOUND OUT ABOUT ACTUARIAL SCIENCE AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BECOMING AN ACTUARY WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE
GSX_5gNCnRo_2 ARMS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND I WAS LOOKING FOR A SUMMER JOB IN A COMPANY FROM CHICAGO CHAIN TO THE COLLEGE TO INTERVIEW PEOPLE TO HIRE IS SUMMER STUDENTS
GSX_5gNCnRo_3 THAT WAS MY FIRST EXPOSURE TO ACTUARIAL WORK
GSX_5gNCnRo_4 I AM ON TO THE JOB AND ENJOY THE WORK AND FOUND HOWL ON THE EXAMS WORKED IN THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER I WOULD LIKE TO BE AN ACTUAL <UNK>
GSX_5gNCnRo_5 <UNK> IS ALREADY ON MAJORING IN MATHEMATICS IN YOU WENT IN ONE OF THE A TEACHER
GSX_5gNCnRo_6 I THOUGHT I MIGHT GO INTO PROGRAMMING THAT WAS CERTAINLY AN OPTION FOR ME BUT PALM I LIKE A COMPANY THAT I WORKED FOR WORK THERE FOR TWO SUMMER'S THEY OFFER THEM A JOB WHEN I GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE AND I THINK IT
GSX_5gNCnRo_7 SO THAT WAS A PRETTY EASY ENTRY INTO THE FIELD
GSX_5gNCnRo_8 ONCE YOU ARE OF ACTUARIAL STUDENT GENERALLY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL HELP YOU ALSO CONSULTING FIRMS WILL HELP YOU ON ATTAIN YOUR FELLOWSHIP BY GIVING YOU STUDY TIME IN ENCOURAGING YOU TO PASS EXAMS BY GIVING YOU INCENTIVE RACES AS YOU DO PROGRESS READ THE EXAMINATIONS
GSX_5gNCnRo_9 IF YOU GUESS THE EXAMINATIONS YOU DON'T REALLY EVEN NEED A COLLEGE EDUCATION TO BECOME AN ACTUARY
GSX_5gNCnRo_10 I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE THAT HAVE GOTTEN THEIR FELLOWSHIPS WITHOUT EVER HAVING GRADUATED FROM COLUMNS
GSX_5gNCnRo_11 AND THAT'S THAT TO COMMON THESE DAYS BUT YOU ARE ABLE TO LEARN WHEN YOU NEED TO KNOW TO BECOME AN ACTUARY BY SETTING THE ON MATERIAL THAT IS PROVIDED BY THE SIDE OF INJURIES
GjvD6mWI2aE_1 I'M MIKE LOPEZ WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'LL BE DISCUSSING HERE SKATE AND ITS EXPANSION SETS
GjvD6mWI2aE_2 AND THAT ARE GOING OVER PUTTING A LOT AGAIN
GjvD6mWI2aE_3 WHEN YOU WANT ANOTHER CONSISTS OF PUTTING PIECES TOGETHER AND AS WE SEE HERE WE HAVE TO STRAIGHTEN PIECES THAT HAVE GROOVES ON EQUAL AND OPPOSITE SIDES AND WE ARE GOING TO DO IN YOUR ONE AND MASH THE GROOVES ON THE SIDES UP AND SLIDE THEM TOGETHER
GjvD6mWI2aE_4 ONCE AGAIN MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE GROOVE SIDE BECAUSE IF YOU DO NOT IN YOUR PIECES WILL NOT SLIDE TOGETHER
GjvD6mWI2aE_5 SO YOU WILL TAKE THE PIECES AND THE LAST HUNDREDS OF AND SLIDE THEM TOGETHER LIKE SO
GjvD6mWI2aE_6 AND ONCE AGAIN MAKE SURE THAT YOU NATIONAL QUICKLY BECAUSE AS YOU SEE HERE THERE'S A SPACE
GjvD6mWI2aE_7 SO TOUCH THE LITTLE BUT AGAIN AND MAKE SURE TO PUSH THEM ALL THE WAY TO GET IT OUT SO THERE'S NO SPACE IN BETWEEN THEM AND THEN YOU WILL TAKE THE BOTTOM PIECES THAT ARE HEXAGONAL AND MASTER LOVE TO THE NEXT SEGMENT PIECES ON GIMBLED
GjvD6mWI2aE_8 AND THAT IS THE BEGINNING OF YOUR WALL
gU2a1iWlJNA_1 ALRIGHT IF FIRST THING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT BOUNCE JUGGLING IS WHAT KIND OF ALDYS
gU2a1iWlJNA_2 THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT ONES AND YOU CAN USE
gU2a1iWlJNA_3 EYELETS USE LACROSSE FALLS
gU2a1iWlJNA_4 GET I'M PRETTY MUCH ANY SPORTING GOOD STORE AND THEY'RE REALLY CHEAP
gU2a1iWlJNA_5 WE DON'T LAST FOREVER AND AS YOU CAN SEE THEY GO GET STAINED IN YOU CAN'T REALLY EVER GET HIM TO BE THE ORIGINAL COLOR THAT THEY WERE AGAIN
gU2a1iWlJNA_6 WATT CONSIDERING YOUR OTHER OPTION IS REALLY A OF SILICONE JUGGLING BALL THAT RUN ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY TO FIFTY DOLLARS A PIECE
gU2a1iWlJNA_7 THEY DON'T BOUNCE AS WELL BUT I THINK THE PRICE MIX UP FOR
gU2a1iWlJNA_8 THE OTHER THING THAT YOU NEED IS SOME THAT
gU2a1iWlJNA_9 SOME PEOPLE USE A SLAB OF MARBLE THEY GET BECAUSE IT'S PERFECTLY SMOOTH AND PERFECTLY FLAT
gU2a1iWlJNA_10 OFF THAT LEAVES OUT OF ITS A SIDEWALK CEMENT WITHOUT ANYTHING YOU KNOW WHAT DID IT'S TAKEN OUT OF IT OR ANYTHING IS A GOOD PLACE IS YOU NEED A GOOD YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT WHICH WAY THE BALLS IN A BOUNCE BACK OUT
gU2a1iWlJNA_11 I WOULD ALSO STEER CLEAR OF OF BLACK TOP BECAUSE IT'S TO HITTING IF THAT ONCE YOU HAVE THOSE THINGS SQUARED AWAY YOU'RE READY TO START BOUNCE JUGGLING
GZSOTSSh1hU_1 SO THAT WE HAVE OUR GLAZED MIX WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY
GZSOTSSh1hU_2 AND THE OF ORIGINAL AN OLD FASHIONED METHOD OF DOING IS BY THE WAY THIS IS MY LARGE COMMERCIALS FISH
GZSOTSSh1hU_3 AND WHEN YOU THINK FIFTH LACING WONDERFUL THING THE BOTTOM WITH CAN AN OF THEM MAKE SURE THAT YOU BRING EVERYTHING AROUND
GZSOTSSh1hU_4 THE ONLY IT'S HALF THE THICKNESS THAT ARE GLAZES TO THAT FINGER IN THERE AND JUST THING IF IT BREAKS AND FOLD THE VIEW KNUCKLES
GZSOTSSh1hU_5 AND IT SHOULD BE THICK AROUND YOUR FINGER AND BREAKING AND PULL THE VIEW KNUCKLES
GZSOTSSh1hU_6 OF ABOUT THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY FOR LIGHTS
GZSOTSSh1hU_7 AND THAT'S NOT A COMPLETELY FOOLPROOF WAY OF TESTING THE CONSISTENCY VIEW CLAVE
GZSOTSSh1hU_8 THE ONLY WAY TO BE A HUNDRED PERCENT CERTAIN IS TO USE A HYDROMETER
GZSOTSSh1hU_9 LIKE I SAID THIS MEASURES THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE GLAZE WHICH IS THE AMOUNT OF WATER IN THIS MIXTURE
GZSOTSSh1hU_10 <UNK> AND IT HAS THE OUT VERY WELL
GZSOTSSh1hU_11 <UNK> IS THE DUST THAT'LL OUT RATHER QUICKLY IF IF IT EVERY TIME INTO ANYTHING WITH THE ERNSTER <UNK>
GZSOTSSh1hU_12 IT IN AND TAKE YOUR SPONGE GET IT JUST BARELY MOIST AND WIPE OFF YOUR HYDROMETER
GZSOTSSh1hU_13 YOU DON'T WANT A HYDROMETER WET WHICH YOU DON'T WANT IT TO THICK EITHER
GZSOTSSh1hU_14 AND THEN JUST DROP THIS RIGHT IN HERE GENTLY AND LET IT FALL UNTIL IT STOPS FALLING
GZSOTSSh1hU_15 AND WHAT THAT SETTLES EVEN TOP EXCITED ABOUT IT JUST GENTLY AND IT CAN URGENT TOOTH FINAL POSITION
GZSOTSSh1hU_16 WITH SADDLES YOU LOOK AND SEE WHERE THE TOP OF THE MINUTES WITH IS ON HYDROMETER
GZSOTSSh1hU_17 AND THAT TELLS YOU THE READING
GZSOTSSh1hU_18 IN THIS CASE WE'VE GOT FOURTEEN TWENTY WHICH IS JUST RIGHT FOR THIS PARTICULAR GLAZE
GZSOTSSh1hU_19 USUALLY BETWEEN FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN FIFTY IS A HYDROMETER READING THAT YOU CAN BE LOOKING FOR IN ZOOM OR GLAZES
GgiaPMSLOi0_1 HI THIS IS JON ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE IN THIS VIDEO CLIP WE WILL BE INSTALLING THE TOP
GgiaPMSLOi0_2 AFTER INSTALLING THE BOTTOM PIECE I WENT AHEAD AND FLIP IT UP MY CHEST OF DRAWERS UP ONTO THE WORKBENCH THIS WILL REALLY HOT WHEN INSTALLING THE TOP
GgiaPMSLOi0_3 THE FIRST THING THAT YOU NEED TO DO USE DRY FIT THE TAUGHT HIM FOR JUST GO AHEAD AND SET THAT IN PLACE AND MAKE SURE ALL OF YOUR MEASUREMENTS WE'RE CORRECT EVERYTHING LOOKS PRETTY GOOD <UNK>
GgiaPMSLOi0_4 NEXT WE WILL GO AHEAD AND GLUE IT FROM PLACE OUR TOP ON THERE MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS FLASH AND WHERE WE WANT IT TO BE KEPT THE A
GgiaPMSLOi0_5 AND THEN INHALE IT IN PLACE ONCE OUR TOP IS ON A MINI GOING TAKE THE SQUARE AND MAKE SURE THAT MY CABINET IS SQUARE
GgiaPMSLOi0_6 IF IT'S NOT YOU WANT TO BEND IT UNTIL BECOMES WHERE SO THAT WHEN THE GLUE DRIES EVERYTHING WILL LINER
hJPX0grNGho_1 I IS YOUR KNEE AND OF EXPERT VILLAGE
hJPX0grNGho_2 I USUALLY USE A <UNK> OR ALL THE DIFFERENT LOOP VARIETIES
hJPX0grNGho_3 RIGHT NOW READY GO AHEAD AND TALK ABOUT THAT ONE SIXTY READY BOOM OF THIS
hJPX0grNGho_4 A HOUSE LENSES IF THESE OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE ONE IF THE INTERVAL WITH IF HAS THAT HIS LOFT FLAT
hJPX0grNGho_5 BECAUSE IT WAS LINE AND OR EVEN ACTUALLY HAS A LOT LESS WAS THAT OF HALF LETTERS OF THAT FOOT FLAT FLAT FLY
hJPX0grNGho_6 USUALLY FLAWS IS IS YOU DON'T USE FOR HIS EYES IN GENERAL WAS WHEN SOMETHING SMALLER DETAIL WORK ON SOMETHING REALLY LARGE
hJPX0grNGho_7 FOR EXAMPLE IF WAS TERMINAL IF IT IS NOT <UNK> AND I'M JUST GET LARGE HIS ARMS
hJPX0grNGho_8 AND IN THE IF YOUTH HALF OF AREA OF WHICH ALSO IF YOU IT IS MORE THINNER AND LEGAL OF A SMALL DESIGN
hJPX0grNGho_9 IT'S ACTUALLY A FLOW WITH THREE IN HALF OF LIFE TENTH FINESSING OFF ONCE THESE THESE IS THAT THEY ARE CHEAPER THAN TO SIXTIES BY A MEDIUM AT ALL OR AN
hJPX0grNGho_10 BUT DON'T IF F G RECEIVER
GM9nzQOBMMQ_1 HI THIS IS JON AND IN THIS CLIP I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THE TOOLS NEEDED TO COMPLETE OUR PROJECT
GM9nzQOBMMQ_2 FIRST WE'RE GONNA NEED EIGHT PENCIL AND TAPE MEASURE TO HELP US DO ALL THE MEASURING IN MARKING IN DESIGNING AND DRAWING UP OUR PROJECT
GM9nzQOBMMQ_3 TO CUT OUT THE IN PIECES WE USE A RADIAL ARM SOFT TO SIZE OF THE LENGTH A TABLE SAW TO CUT THE WITH AND A BAND SAW TO CUT OUR ANGLES
GM9nzQOBMMQ_4 FOR OUR LONG SIDES THE BOTTOM AND THE HANDLE WE USE THE REGULAR ARM SAW DIDN'T CUT THE LENGTH AND THE TABLE SAW TO CUT THE WITH
GM9nzQOBMMQ_5 TO ASSEMBLE ALL OF OUR PIECES TOGETHER WE NEED EIGHT DRILL WITH A FEW DIFFERENT SIZES OF DRILL BITS OF DEPENDING ON IF YOU WANT TO COUNTERSINK OR SCREWS ARE NOT
GM9nzQOBMMQ_6 IN ADDITION WE NEED A SCREWDRIVER BIT FOR OUR DRILL
GM9nzQOBMMQ_7 FOR THE HANDLE NOTCH WE USED A DRILL A AND A BAND SAW TO FINISH CUTTING IT OUT
GM9nzQOBMMQ_8 AND FOR DIVIDERS WE USE THE SAME PROCEDURE OF USING A DRILL THE DRILL A HOLE IN A BAND SAW TO FINISH CUTTING IT OUT
GM9nzQOBMMQ_9 AND LASTLY WE FINISHED UP OUR PROJECT I'VE SEEN IT WITH A FEW DIFFERENT GRITS OF SANDPAPER
gtCqNfEDSB4_1 HI THIS IS STEVE BAUMAN FROM SUMMER HAZE MUSIC IN MURRAY UTAH
gtCqNfEDSB4_2 NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BASS GUITAR TODAY
gtCqNfEDSB4_3 AND ONE OF THE TOPICS THAT IS HOW TO RESTRING A BASE
gtCqNfEDSB4_4 THE CORRECT WAY TO DO THAT
gtCqNfEDSB4_5 AND ON SOME TO DEMONSTRATE HOW TO DO THAT
gtCqNfEDSB4_6 THERE'S A LOT OF WRONG WAY IS OUT THERE
gtCqNfEDSB4_7 I HAVE THAT THERE IS A FEW RIGHT WAYS TO DO IT TOO
gtCqNfEDSB4_8 BUT ON THE MAIN THING IS YOU DON'T EVER DO ANYTHING IS KINDA DAMAGE YOUR BASE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
gtCqNfEDSB4_9 AND IT'S USUALLY NOT A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE ALL OF THE STRINGS OFF AT ONCE
gtCqNfEDSB4_10 THAT CAN OF THE THINGS THAT CAN DAMAGE THE NECK
gtCqNfEDSB4_11 SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU JUST DO ONE AND TIME
gtCqNfEDSB4_12 SO HERE I'VE GOT A BASE THAT HAS THE LOW E STRING TAKEN OFF
gtCqNfEDSB4_13 AND I'M JUST GONNA SHOW HOW TO PUT IT ON
gtCqNfEDSB4_14 TO THE FIRST STEP IS JUST TO FEED THE STRING THROUGH TO DESIGNATED HOLES DOWN HERE AT THE BRIDGE
gtCqNfEDSB4_15 NOW SOME BASES HAVE THAT THAT HAVE THE HOLES IN THE BACK OF THE BASE
gtCqNfEDSB4_16 AND THIS IS TO THE TUB STRINGS TO THE BODY
gtCqNfEDSB4_17 BUT IF IT'S A BRIDGE LIKE THIS OTHER JUST A HOLE RIGHT HERE FULLY TO FEED THE STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_18 I JUST TONNAGE LUNGE YOU THAT
gtCqNfEDSB4_19 THIS FULL INDUSTRY ALL THEY FLIP
gtCqNfEDSB4_20 AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS IN THE RIGHT SPOT
gtCqNfEDSB4_21 AND THAT THIS IS GOING OVER WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO COME OVER THE SADDLE
gtCqNfEDSB4_22 NOW THIS IS CALLED THE SADDLE RIGHT IN HERE
gtCqNfEDSB4_23 SO LET'S DO THAT TO TO THEM AND MOVE UP TO THE OTHER END IS BASED
gtCqNfEDSB4_24 ONCE WE'RE HERE WE WANT TO HAVE THE RIGHT LENGTH FROM STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_25 'CAUSE IF NOT YOU CAN END UP WITH A TIMER WRAPPING
gtCqNfEDSB4_26 WHICH CAN BE KEY WHICH CAN AFFECT THE INTONATION <UNK>
gtCqNfEDSB4_27 AND THEY CAN ALSO TAKE GESTURING POP OFF OF THE TUNER
gtCqNfEDSB4_28 SO GOOD RULE OF THUMB IS TO THE EXTENT PULL THE STRING ALL THE WAY TIGHT
gtCqNfEDSB4_29 AND THIS EXTENDED ALL THE WAY
gtCqNfEDSB4_30 AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE A GOOD <UNK> I'M FOR FIVE INCHES BEYOND THE TUNING PEG
gtCqNfEDSB4_31 THE YEAR THAT WOULD BE WRAPPING UNIT
gtCqNfEDSB4_32 SO IT DOES MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO WRAP AT LEAST A COUPLE TIMES
gtCqNfEDSB4_33 ARM YOU DON'T WANT IT TO TOO LONG
gtCqNfEDSB4_34 BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TOO SHORT
gtCqNfEDSB4_35 SO THE FIRST STEP IS IS TO JUST TO STICK THE END OF THE STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_36 WELL IT FIRST VOLUME ON A CUT THE STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_37 JUST UNDER WIRE CUTTERS TO THE RIGHT LENGTH THAT YOU WANT IT
gtCqNfEDSB4_38 SO YOU WANT TO TAKE THE END OF THE STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_39 AND BE CAREFUL CAUSE THEY'RE VERY SHARP ON THE END
gtCqNfEDSB4_40 AND JUST STICK IT DOWN INTO THE THE HOLD IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS TUNING MACHINE
gtCqNfEDSB4_41 AS A WHOLE THE GOES STRAIGHT DOWN
gtCqNfEDSB4_42 SO STICK IT DOWN THERE FIRST
gtCqNfEDSB4_43 DON'T WRAP IT FIRST
gtCqNfEDSB4_44 STICK IT DOWN THERE FIRST
gtCqNfEDSB4_45 AND THEN ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS YOU BRING IT OFF
gtCqNfEDSB4_46 AND PUTS INCREASES IN THE STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_47 IN THIS WRAP IT ONCE OR TWICE
gtCqNfEDSB4_48 AND YOU WANT IT TO COME OFF ON THE INSIDE OF THE BASE
gtCqNfEDSB4_49 NOT COME OFF ON THE OUTSIDE
gtCqNfEDSB4_50 BECAUSE THAT WAY YOU WANT TO BUILD A TURN THE RIGHT WAY
gtCqNfEDSB4_51 SO GRAB THE STRING ONCE OR TWICE CASE CLOCKWISE
gtCqNfEDSB4_52 HI I'M IT'S AND THEN PUSH THE STRING DOWN
gtCqNfEDSB4_53 SO THAT YOU'RE PRESSING IT AGAINST THE THE HEADSTOCK HERE
gtCqNfEDSB4_54 AND FEED IT THROUGH WEARS SUPPOSED TO GO
gtCqNfEDSB4_55 AND THEN JUST START WINDING
gtCqNfEDSB4_56 YOU WANNA KEEP SYNTH DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE STRING
gtCqNfEDSB4_57 AND PUSH IT DOWN
gtCqNfEDSB4_58 SO THAT IT DOESN'T COME OUT OF <UNK>
gtCqNfEDSB4_59 AND ALSO YOU WANT IT
gtCqNfEDSB4_60 SO THAT IT'S BOOT IT'S WINDING DOWN TOWARDS THE BASE
gtCqNfEDSB4_61 NOT WINDING FROM THE BOTTOM UP
gtCqNfEDSB4_62 SO JUST WIND UP
gtCqNfEDSB4_63 HAVE MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE STAYING IN THAT POSITION
gtCqNfEDSB4_64 MAKING SURE THAT DOWN AND THE SATELLITE STAYING WHERE NEEDS TO BE
gtCqNfEDSB4_65 AND THAT ONCE YOU GET IT TIGHT AND OFF
gtCqNfEDSB4_66 AND BRING THE BRING THE STRING UP TO PITCH
gtCqNfEDSB4_67 AND YOU WANT A PLEASANT TENSION ON IT
gtCqNfEDSB4_68 ADD DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE ALL THE WAY TIE ALL THE WAY TO PITCH
gtCqNfEDSB4_69 BUT JUST BRIDGE POSE AND TENSION ON IT BEFORE YOU START ON THE NEXT STRING

GL0jG3gy4rk_1 HI MY NAME IS LAUREN SAME YOUR DISCUSSED DISCUSSED HOW MUCH MONEY AND AS A PERMANENT HAIR STRAIGHT IN COST
GL0jG3gy4rk_2 THERE ARE TWO SIDES STRAIGHTENERS THAT YOU CAN DO AT THIS POINT
GL0jG3gy4rk_3 YOU HAVE YOUR RELAXER WOULD SIMPLY SOFTEN YOUR NATURAL CRONE RELAXES IT'S MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO BLOW YOUR OWN HAIR OUT IN ORDER TO MANAGER CURL
GL0jG3gy4rk_4 THE RELAXER CAN BRING FROM A KINKY CONES A BIT OF A SOFTER CURL
GL0jG3gy4rk_5 I CAN ALSO TRY TO HELP YOU ACHIEVE THAT STRAIGHT HOWEVER THE RELAXER WILL MORE LAST TWO MORE OF A RELAXATION UNDER CROW NOT NECESSARILY STRAIGHTEN IT
GL0jG3gy4rk_6 USUALLY YOUR RELAXERS RUN ABOUT ANYWHERE FROM SIXTY FIVE TO EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS IN ORDER TO PUT THE RELAXER ON
GL0jG3gy4rk_7 IN ORDER TO HAVE PROCESSING COST PRODUCT
GL0jG3gy4rk_8 IT DOES NOT TAKE TOO LONG AND PROBABLY BE ABOUT AN HOUR AN ENTIRE PROCESSING TIME AND OF COURSE THE GLASS
GL0jG3gy4rk_9 THE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN AMOUNT DEMO STRAIGHTENERS BE MORE LESSER JAPANESE STRAIGHTENING OR IONIC STRAIGHTENERS
GL0jG3gy4rk_10 THIS PROCESS FOR THAT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME CONSUMING IN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU GO THROUGH WITH A STRAIGHT IRON AND STRAIGHTEN THE HAIR UP AFTER YOU PROCESS IT
GL0jG3gy4rk_11 AND THEN YOU NEUTRALIZE THE HAIR WITH THAT STRAIGHTENER
GL0jG3gy4rk_12 THIS PROCESS IN TAKE ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO FIVE HOURS
GL0jG3gy4rk_13 IT'S GOING TO BE MORE ON QUEST COARSELY AND BUT OTHER DEFINITELY MORE EFFECTIVE IN GETTING KINKY CURLY HAIR INTO A LOT STRAIGHTER HAIRSTYLE
GL0jG3gy4rk_14 SO YOU TAKE YOU COULDN'T BE LOOKING ANYWHERE FROM SIXTY FIVE AND THEN WORK YOUR WAY UP DEPENDING ON YOUR HAIR DENSITY YOUR HAIR LANE AND WHERE YOU ACTUALLY GO
GL0jG3gy4rk_15 AND WHAT SPA SALON ON WHERE YOU'RE GO OR STYLIST IS AND HOW MUCH THEY ARE CHARGING
GL0jG3gy4rk_16 AND THAT IS HOW MUCH HAIR STRAIGHTENERS COST

gjgIM_u-bJU_1 LAZY CHAIN WOULD REFER TO THE THE ORDER IN WHICH THE PEDALS ARE PLACED ON THE BOARD
gjgIM_u-bJU_2 BECAUSE AS YOU GO ALONG YOU CAN GO OUT OF A GUITAR IN THE FIRST PADDLE
gjgIM_u-bJU_3 WHEN YOU GET TO THE SECOND PADDLE THE SECOND PADDLE IS GOING TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON EVERYTHING THAT CAME BEFORE

Gje0P7J9pSw_4 CURL THE LOWER FINGERS THE ROUND THE YARN TO HOLD IT IN YOUR BALL
Gje0P7J9pSw_5 PLACE THE NEEDLE THROUGH THE TRIANGLE AND THEN FOLLOW UP WITH SOME THROUGH THE LOOP DOWN THE POINTER FINGER AND DOWN THROUGH THE LOOP ON THE THONG
Gje0P7J9pSw_6 USE THE THUMB TO TIGHTEN UP WITHOUT LETTING GO OF YOUR YARN AND THE OF CAST ON YOUR FIRST TWO STITCHES
Gje0P7J9pSw_7 FOR NOW LINE EACH TIME THAT YOU REPEAT THIS PROCEDURE YOU WILL ADD ONE STITCH

GVox5SW_Jj8_21 AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE A LOT OF TEXTURE GOING ON HERE ARE FIBERS LOVE FILTER THAT WE JUST APPLY
GVox5SW_Jj8_22 SO WELL THE SCOPE HEARING OWN <UNK>
GVox5SW_Jj8_23 OR A CALLS RIGHT HERE FOR RIGHT NOW I WILL PICK UP THE NEXT PART
GNJ7z3m8V_k_1 THE FIRST IN ONE TO DO IS MAKE SOME SHAPES THAT IN AND GO AROUND THE LAMP SHADE
GNJ7z3m8V_k_2 THOSE ARE THE PROJECT CAN EITHER BE DONE BY A FREE HAND DRAWING OR YOU CAN JUST TAKE SOME SHAPES THAT ARE PRINTED OUT FROM A COMPUTER OR YOU CAN TAKE ANY ON SOME HOME HARD IMAGES IN THE HINGES CHASE AROUND THEM LIKE A ON PIECES OF A PUZZLE A GIVEN A SHAPE SOMETIMES
GNJ7z3m8V_k_3 BUT WE GO AHEAD AND MAKE DIFFERENT IMAGES
GNJ7z3m8V_k_4 THOSE IMPORTANCE AND NOT MAKE IMAGES TO BIG WE DON'T WANT HIM TO TAKE ANY TAKE UP ANY LARGE AREAS OF THE LAMP SHADE THE WHOLE I'LL THOUGH THE WHOLE LINE NICE THING ABOUT LOW
GNJ7z3m8V_k_5 ONE OF THE NICE FEATURES ABOUT OF DOING THE LANE CHANGES THAT IS MADE UP OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT SMALL IMAGES GO ALL THE WAY AROUND THE LAMP SHADE
GNJ7z3m8V_k_6 SO IT'LL AND ONE IMAGE TAKING UP TOO MUCH SPACE ON ON THAT WHEN THEY BECOME TRACED ONTO THE PLASTIC ON A PLASTIC SHEET WHICH IS GOING TO BE THE THE LAND SHADE ITSELF
GNJ7z3m8V_k_7 IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHERE TO PUT THE IMAGES ON THE PAPER BECAUSE A PAPER CAN BE MOVED AROUND AND WHEN IT'S TRACED ONTO THE THE SHEET OF PLASTIC IT COULD BE ON IT COULD JUST BE MOVED AROUND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EXACTLY AS LOOKS ON THE PAGE
GNJ7z3m8V_k_8 SWIMMING DIFFERENT SHADES HERE USING A THEME OF LIKE KIND OF A BEACH WATER THEME I HAVE SOME FINISHED OUR FISH AND THEN DIFFERENT THINGS AND USUALLY FIND AROUND THE OCEAN ON THE BEACH
GNJ7z3m8V_k_9 ALSO SHOW THE TO DRAW SOME IMAGES THAT CAN BE COLUMN COLORED NICELY ON EASILY COLORED AND YOU CAN ALSO USE THAT A LOT OF DIFFERENT COLORS WHEN YOU ONE WAY TO DECORATE THEM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE ALSO THE PROJECT STAND OUT OF THE ON THE IMAGES ARE GOING TO BE HAVE SOME SOME NICE LIVELY BRIGHT COLORS
GNJ7z3m8V_k_10 FOR THE SHEET OF PLASTIC THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING THESE IMAGES ON WILL QUALITY ABOUT TO TEN OR TWELVE IMAGES
GNJ7z3m8V_k_11 NOW THAT YOU CAN USE THE SAME IMAGE OVER AGAIN BECAUSE AS BEING TRAYS
GNJ7z3m8V_k_12 SO I'M USING A SHEET OF PLASTIC ABOUT ABOUT TWENTY FOUR INCHES IN LENGTH FULL THE ROUND SO FOR THAT YOU LEAVE ABOUT TEN DIFFERENT IMAGES TO GO TEN TO TWELVE IMAGES TO GO AROUND
GNJ7z3m8V_k_13 SUCH A NEW NOW HOW TO MAKE SOME IMAGES ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND GET THEM READY TO BE TRANSFER ON TO THE SHEET OF PLASTIC
ghWwS5ev6xk_1 ONE WAY TO GET READY FOR DOING THINGS THAT AND THEN A LEVER HOLE IS TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT YOU DO YEARS FOR TSE STROKES IN STANDING WATER OR EVEN YOUR REVERSE EACH STROKES AND FLAT WATER
ghWwS5ev6xk_2 WHAT I WANT TO DO THIS THE STROKE IS WINE BACK UP TO THE END
ghWwS5ev6xk_3 AND WHAT I'M LOOKING GOOD REALLY TRY AND DO IS KEEP MY TORSO POWER IN FROM MY KAYAK
ghWwS5ev6xk_4 SO WHEN I LINE UP TO THE BEGINNING ASLEEP I HAVE A LOT OF CAR PULLING THE BOAT INTO THE SIDE AS THE ONLINE MY TORSO COME BACK TO NEUTRAL AND USE THAT POWER
ghWwS5ev6xk_5 IF I GO ANY FURTHER BACK I'M ASHLEY COUNTERACTING THAT'S BEEN AND THAT'S THAT
ghWwS5ev6xk_6 SO ON AND GO FROM SIDE <UNK> IS A FLASHY ONE BACK UP AGAIN AT THE TAIL AND MY SWEET AND IS A KEY THE BOAT PULLING AROUND
ghWwS5ev6xk_7 SO TAKE A LOAF ALIGNED UP SUITS THE METAL IF LINLEY LINED UP AND THAT REALLY LOVE THE BOAT AND HE THUMBING THEN CAN PHONE LAND
ghWwS5ev6xk_8 AND THIS IS THE STROKE THAT THE PROS ARE USED AN EASY I'M DOING THINGS IN THE ON WAIVER THINGS IN THE HOLE
ghWwS5ev6xk_9 THE MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH IT THE MORE SNAPPY GET

GWnPJ-kSeJQ_10 JUST ACTUALLY TAKE YOUR BUTTON ON THIS WAY IT DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE WHEN STITCH IT
GWnPJ-kSeJQ_11 JUST PUT A SMALL PIECE OF SCOTCH TAPE DOWN IN THE POSITION AND YOU TAKE IT SHEEN <UNK> INCHES LINED UP RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE FOOT TO A
GWnPJ-kSeJQ_12 YOU CAN AND PUT IT ON THE SECOND STEP OF YOUR BUTTONHOLE THE SECOND OR THE FOURTH STEP WHICH IS THE SEAM OF YOUR FOUR STEP BUTTONHOLE

GF6ryZbj9WU_7 AND WHAT I WANT TO DO HERE AT THE TOP OF A SLOW ONE GIVE SOME THE IMPRESSION OF SOIL SINCE IT'S LIGHTER
GF6ryZbj9WU_8 AND AS YOU GO FURTHER DOWN OUT AND DARKEN THIS LAYER SUBSTANTIALLY
GF6ryZbj9WU_9 THIS IS A ROCKY OUT CROPPING OUT THERE
GF6ryZbj9WU_10 WE HAVE SOME LIGHT SOURCES BEHIND THE RAW CURRY WHICH MEANS THIS IS GOING TO LOOK MUCH DARKER TO OUR EYES THAN INITIALLY
GF6ryZbj9WU_11 NOW SEE HOW THE PREVIOUS LAYERS BLENDING INTO WHAT WE ARE THE HALF
GF6ryZbj9WU_12 THAT'S REALLY REALLY GREAT
GF6ryZbj9WU_13 OTHERWISE WE JUST PAINT THE WHOLE THING DARK TO BEGIN WITH
GF6ryZbj9WU_14 WE WANT THAT TEXTURE THOSE TONES AS UNDERLYING COLORS

hBnhad-oh5M_1 AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT WHEN YOU GO STRAIGHT BACK FOR THE DRYERS NOW A FACILITY SLICE STRAIGHT OVER THE SNOW AND THIS KNOWS WHAT IT YOU CAN DO FAN PATTERN BECAUSE IT'LL AT THAT WATER REPEL OFFICE ISAAC ATTIRE DOES
hBnhad-oh5M_2 I'LL DEMONSTRATE ONLY DOES NOT WORTH THE STRAIGHT BACK BUFFING HAVING A JUST WANTED TO BUFF BUFFING THAT RESIN PRETTY FIRM AND PULL IT STRAIGHT BACK ON THE SNOWBOARD
hBnhad-oh5M_3 IF IF THEN IT WAS REALLY WHAT ZILLION GO IN A FAN PATTERN FAN LIKE A RAIN TIRE
hBnhad-oh5M_4 DOES IT TAKE ABOUT AND BAD <UNK> OFF THEN MOTIONS THIS DOWN BOOF IF IF FOR IF IF AFTER DOING THE COMPLETE VANPATTEN ADDRESS IS NO WAY IN ON THE OTHER SIDE AND ON THE OPPOSITE WAY FOOT SO REPELS LONGER OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE FOOT FROM <UNK>
H4pCrLzPN0A_1 WE AS HUMAN BEINGS COMMUNICATE WITH BOTH PHYSICAL MOVEMENTS AS WELL AS THE SPOKEN WORK
H4pCrLzPN0A_2 ONE OF THE ASPECTS ABOUT IMPROMPTU SPEAKING IS YOUR BODY LANGUAGE ALSO HELPS YOU TO COMMUNICATE WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY
H4pCrLzPN0A_3 AND IF YOU WILL NOTICE AS WE HAVE STARTED THIS SERIES OF CLIPS I USE MY HANDS QUITE FREQUENTLY
H4pCrLzPN0A_4 THERE ARE MANY OTHER THINGS THAT CAN BE USED IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING A SPEECH
H4pCrLzPN0A_5 BUT CERTAINLY THE USE OF THE HANDS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TO IN ORDER TO EMPHASIZE AND ALSO SOMETIMES IN ORDER TO POINTERS SELF INTO A CERTAIN DIRECTION IN THE SPEECH
H4pCrLzPN0A_6 IT HELPS YOU TO EMPHASIZE CERTAIN POINTS BETTER THEN WOULD BE DONE IF YOU WERE TO JUST SPEAK ONLY WITHOUT ANY HAND MOVEMENTS
H4pCrLzPN0A_7 AND ON TO THE ONE DEMONSTRATION OF THIS
H4pCrLzPN0A_8 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU ONE EXAMPLE WITH HAND MOVEMENTS JUST LIKE THAT AND JUST NOW <UNK> AND A REPEAT THE SAME SITUATION WITHOUT PEN WIDTHS
H4pCrLzPN0A_9 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU ONE SITUATION WITH HAND MOVEMENTS
H4pCrLzPN0A_10 AND THEN LATER I'LL SHOW YOU THE SITUATION WITHOUT HAND MOVEMENTS
H4pCrLzPN0A_11 NOW YOU TELL ME
H4pCrLzPN0A_12 WHICH COMMUNICATES THE BETTER MESSAGE
H4pCrLzPN0A_13 OF COURSE HAND MOVEMENTS
H4pCrLzPN0A_14 DON'T BE AFRAID TO USE YOUR BODY TO HELP YOU EXPRESS WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY
H4pCrLzPN0A_15 THAT'S THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF IMPROMPTU SPEAKING
Heh3jXWjXGU_1 IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO BE DOING AN OBLIQUE ISOLATION
Heh3jXWjXGU_2 NOW THIS HAS NO WEIGHT TO IT SO YOU CAN GET THIS ALMOST ANYWHERE IF IT'S A NICE SIZE AS WELL
Heh3jXWjXGU_3 IS THAT THE SIZE OF A OF A WEIGHTED BALL
Heh3jXWjXGU_4 IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH THAT DOWN GENTLY ON ENOUGH GENERAL THAT IF THERE AND EXTEND BOTH LEGS OUT
Heh3jXWjXGU_5 TO TAKE YOUR ARMS TO THE SIDE
Heh3jXWjXGU_6 I HAVE THE OPTION PUTTING THE HAND BEHIND THE HEAD
Heh3jXWjXGU_7 AND IT IN A REACH ACROSS PASS THAT KNEE FITTED DELETE SQUEEZE AND THEN COME BACK TO THE BEGINNING POSITION WITH YOUR ARM NICE IN OF THEN AND YOUR SHOULDER RELAXED
Heh3jXWjXGU_8 EXHALE AS YOU COME ACROSS AND REACH OFF AND THEN TAKE IT BACK OFF
Heh3jXWjXGU_9 THEN IF YOU FAIL WILL FILL ELEVEN BURROW INTO QUADRICEPS BECAUSE YOUR LEGS ARE ELEVATED
Heh3jXWjXGU_10 NOW IF YOU HAVE BACK ISSUES IF WE ALSO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL OPTION
Heh3jXWjXGU_11 AND I CAN TAKE YOUR LEGS TO NINETY DEGREES
Heh3jXWjXGU_12 IF THE USUAL BUT MORE SUPPORT AND PUSH IT BACK A LITTLE FURTHER TOWARDS THE MAT
Heh3jXWjXGU_13 WE CAN ALSO CROSS YOUR ANKLES OFF FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT
Heh3jXWjXGU_14 IF NOT FOR SOME REASON THAT STILL BOTHERS YOUR BACK YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE YOUR FEET TO THE COUNT <UNK> IF YOU STILL FEEL THE INSULATION OF THE OBLIQUE
Heh3jXWjXGU_16 BLEACH IF PHENOLICS
Heh3jXWjXGU_17 ACROSS AND RELEASE
Heh3jXWjXGU_18 NOW OUR OTHER OPTION NINETY DEGREES WHICH CROSS OFF AND RELEASE
H10zXoKpvtI_1 OKAY THE NEXT BARRIER TO COMMUNICATION IS EXPECTATIONS
H10zXoKpvtI_2 AND THIS ONE ISN'T REALLY REALLY HARD BECAUSE WE AS HUMANS REALLY LIGHT TO GET WHAT WE WANT
H10zXoKpvtI_3 BUT AN EXPECTATION ISN'T GOING INTO SOMETHING WHETHER IT'S A CONVERSATION OF A RELATIONSHIP WHATEVER IT IS AND YOU WANT TO GET WHAT YOU WANT
H10zXoKpvtI_4 YOU HAVE ARE UP PRECONCEIVED IDEA OF THE ANSWERS BUT YOU WANT A WRIST C SO YOU SAY HEY I GOT A JAM WE WENT OUT OF THE MOVIES ON FRIDAY
H10zXoKpvtI_5 WELL MAYBE YOU ASK WHO BECAUSE YOU REALLY DO ONE GO TO THE MOVIES AND YOU REALLY WANT HIM TO WANT TO GO TO THE MOVIES AND HE SAYS NO
H10zXoKpvtI_6 WELL WHAT HAPPENS
H10zXoKpvtI_7 YOU DON'T GET WHAT YOU WANT AND BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T EXPECTING HIM TO SAY THAT HE WANTED TO GO SO MANNER DISAPPOINTED AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DISAPPOINTING
H10zXoKpvtI_8 SOMETIMES YOU GET ANGRY SOME HAS MAYBE DON'T TALK ANYMORE SOME HUNDRED PASS OUT SOME HUNTER BITTERS SOMETIMES YOU AND AND OR IN <UNK>
H10zXoKpvtI_9 IT CAN PASS THE LIGHT TO EXTREME PROPORTIONS WHEN ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS THE GOAL WITH IT
H10zXoKpvtI_10 DON'T ENTER EVERY CONVERSATION IN EVERY RELATIONSHIP WITH AN EXPECTATION WITH WHAT YOU WANT
H10zXoKpvtI_11 IT'S OKAY TO HAVE WANTS AND KNEES BUT WHAT'S NOT OKAY IS IN GETTING UP SAT EVERY TIME THAT EXPECTATION IS NOT THE FILLED IN YOUR RELATIONSHIPS

gtiaeinVHZ8_1 A SUBTLE WEAKNESS IN RESISTANCE
gtiaeinVHZ8_2 WHEN YOU ATTACK OR WHEN YOU DEFENDING YOUR POKEMON AS A WEEK IS A RESISTANCE
gtiaeinVHZ8_3 WE'RE LOOKING AT IT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR CLOSE TO THE RETREAT CAUSE
gtiaeinVHZ8_4 IF YOU LOOK LIKE A ONE YEAR HAS A WEAKNESS OF FIGHTING TIGHT AND AS A RESISTANCE TO MELT TITLE
gtiaeinVHZ8_5 UNLESS THERE'S A NUMBER OF ASIDE A WEEK IS A RESISTANCE IS AUTOMATICALLY TWENTY
gtiaeinVHZ8_6 IN THIS OLD ONES CASE ACTUALLY RESISTANCE THE METAL OF THIRTY
gtiaeinVHZ8_7 SO LET'S SAY MY OPPONENT ATTACKS ME WITH THIS NEUTERING WHICH IS ACTUALLY METAL TITLE
gtiaeinVHZ8_8 IT MAKES AN ATTACK SCRATCH FOR TO
gtiaeinVHZ8_9 CAN LIGHTEN THE RESISTANCE OF THIRTY ANY THAT'LL TAKE ANY DAMAGE AT ALL BECAUSE I TAKE THIRTY OFF WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS THEY ATTACK WAVE
gtiaeinVHZ8_10 IF HE WAS ATTACKING WITH FORTY FOR FORTY POINTS OF DAMAGE THAT I WOULD ONLY TAKE TEN BECAUSE MY RESISTANCE IS THIRTY THIS IS WHERE THE MAP IS BAIT ART
gtiaeinVHZ8_11 IF THE PULLED ONE THAT IS ATTACKING IS ONE THAT I HAVE A WEAKNESS TO THAT MEANS THAT I AUTOMATICALLY TAKE TWENTY MORE DAMAGE AND WHAT IT OUT WHAT WHAT THE POKEMON IS ATTACKING
gtiaeinVHZ8_12 SO THIS RIGHT WORN IS HITTING THE WITH ITS WORN OUT AND IT'S A FORTY POINTS OF DAMAGE NOT JUST TWENTY
H2f7L6y9X6Y_1 HI THIS IS JON AND IN THIS CLIP I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT A EMERGENCIES
H2f7L6y9X6Y_2 IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A PHONE HANDY AND IF YOU DON'T WANT A WIRE ONE INTO YOUR SHOP YOU COULD ALWAYS INVEST IN A GOOD CORDLESS PHONE OR YOU CAN USE OR CELL PHONE
H2f7L6y9X6Y_3 ADDITIONALLY YOU CAN POSE THE EMERGENCY NUMBERS NEXT YEAR PHONE SO THAT YOU KNOW WHO RECALL IF YOU NEED HELP
H2f7L6y9X6Y_4 IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO LET SOMEONE KNOW THAT YOU ARE WORKING IN THE SHOP SO THAT IF THEY DON'T HEAR FROM YOU AND WHILE THE ACHILLES COME CHECK ON YOU
H2f7L6y9X6Y_5 ADDITIONALLY YOU CAN INSTALL THOSE INTERCOM SYSTEMS IN YOUR SHOP SO THAT YOU CAN EASILY CONTACT SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE
H2f7L6y9X6Y_6 IT WAS ONCE YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF GOOD E D C FIRE EXTINGUISHERS HANDY IN YOUR SHOP AND MAKE SURE TO ALWAYS KEEP THEM FULLY CHARGED
H2f7L6y9X6Y_7 AND IF ALL ELSE FAILS MAKE SURE YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT EXITS OUT OF YOUR WOOD SHOP
H2f7L6y9X6Y_8 ADDITIONALLY YOU ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR FIRST AID KIT LOCATED IN A CENTRALIZE LOCATION AND IT IS FULLY STOCK
H2f7L6y9X6Y_9 MUCH OF THE TIME IT'S BETTER JUST A STOCK YOURSELF THEN TO GO OUT AND BUY ONE THAT WAY YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN HAVE EXACTLY WHICH YOU NEED
H2f7L6y9X6Y_10 AND LASTLY ANOTHER GOOD TIP IS TO ALWAYS HAVE A CHAIR IN YOUR WOOD SHOP AND KEEP IT NEAR BOTH THE PHONE AND THE FIRST AID SUPPLIES
GeeOYGUqjP0_1 NOW THE ONE AREN'T WITH COILS THAT ARE NOT QUITE READY TO DO IT FREE HAND ARE FREE FORM IT AND I HAD A NEW THE MOLD
GeeOYGUqjP0_2 ON A REALLY GOOD TYPE OF MATERIAL TO USE FOR A MOLD IS ON AN EARTHENWARE PLANTER OR BOWL
GeeOYGUqjP0_3 IT WICKS AWAY MOISTURE SO THE POT IS CONTRITE EVENLY
GeeOYGUqjP0_4 BUT ANY WILL WORK
GeeOYGUqjP0_5 YOU CAN MAKE A PLASTER MOLD ON ANYTHING YOU WHEN YOU USE
GeeOYGUqjP0_6 AND IT'S THE SAME BASIC IDEA
GeeOYGUqjP0_7 I'VE ALREADY DONE THE BOTTOM
GeeOYGUqjP0_8 BUT I'M NOT LAY THE QUEL THEN AND JUST PRESS WITH MY THUMB IF ALL THE WAY AROUND THE POT
GeeOYGUqjP0_9 NOW ON THIS TIGHT ONLY THE INTERIOR IS GETTING SMITH
GeeOYGUqjP0_10 SO THE EXTERIOR IS STILL GOING TO SHOW THE COIL TEXTURE
GeeOYGUqjP0_11 THERE'S GOING TO BE CONCENTRIC RINGS
GeeOYGUqjP0_12 WHICH I'LL SHOW YOU WHEN I TAKE THIS PART OF MOLD
GeeOYGUqjP0_13 IT JUST ONE AND GO AROUND WITH THE COIL
GeeOYGUqjP0_14 AND ON EITHER AT THE VERY END OR AFTER EACH COIL THAT YOU LIKE AND YOU CAN TAKE YOUR SPONGE AND JUST SMOOTH THAT OUT
GeeOYGUqjP0_15 AND THE BENEFIT OF USING COILS FOR PROJECT LIKE THIS IS YOU CAN GET REALLY CONSISTENT EVEN WALLS
GeeOYGUqjP0_16 AND IT'S ALSO ON RELATIVELY EASY TO DO
GeeOYGUqjP0_17 THE SOUND AND FINISH ON FILLINGS MOLD OUT WITH THE COILS AND IN A SHADY WITH IT CAN LOOK LIKE WHEN IT TURNS OUT
GCJfvlG3B_g_1 I'M TIM GIPSON I'M A TALK ABOUT HOW TO USE A MICROWAVE
GCJfvlG3B_g_2 NOW ONE THING USING A MICROPHONE A WAVE ONE THING YOU WANT KEEP IN MIND IS NEVER PUT ANYTHING METALLIC IN YOUR MICROWAVE AND ALSO A NICE FOURS PLASTIC SHOE A PLASTIC THAT YOU USE A MARK WHERE YOU ARE MAKE SURE IT'S RATED FOR MICROWAVE USE
GCJfvlG3B_g_3 FOR INSTANCE CENTER THIS FLATTER SHIELD AND HE IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR MICROWAVE USE AND IT'S A GOOD LENGTH WHO HE HAD FOODS ARE SOME LIKE THAT GOOD HABITS BLACK SHIELD IN THERE BECAUSE OF FOOD IS THE NIPPLE TEND TO POP IT WILL HELP KEEP THE INSIDE YOUR MICROWAVE CLEAN BY DOING THAT TIME
GCJfvlG3B_g_4 WHAT WE ARE READY TO DO A HEAT SOMETHING UP WE ARE CLOSE THE DOOR AND THAT WOULD GET SEVERAL OPTIONS
GCJfvlG3B_g_5 WE CAN SET THE TIME IN THE YELLOW LEVEL OF POWER FOR HEATING WEEKEND SELECT AUTOMATIC TIMES THAT ARE ART THAT ALREADY YET COOK IT TO ITS HIGHEST A LEVEL TEN OF WITH ONE BEING THE LOWEST LEVEL OF HEATING IN TEN BE IN THE HIGHEST AND AND WE ALSO HAVE CENTER COOKING
GCJfvlG3B_g_6 SO WE PUT IT BACK POPCORN IN AND WE CAN HIT THE POPCORN BUTTON AND IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY START A POPCORN AND I'LL ACTUALLY SENSE AND WHEN YOUR POPCORN DEVOUT FINISH POPPING ANOTHER ADVANTAGE WILL ACTUALLY SENSE THAT INTELLECTUAL SHUT OFF ON TIME TO GET THE PERFECT BACK POPCORN EVERY TIME
GCJfvlG3B_g_7 YOU CAN ALSO WELL YOU HAVE A POTATO BUTTON WE'VE PUT A POTATO AND THAT'LL ACTUALLY SET IT FOR THE AUTOMATIC TIME BECAUSE POTATO
GCJfvlG3B_g_8 ANOTHER SENSOR COOKING WE HAVE BEVERAGE AN REHEATING BUTTONS
GCJfvlG3B_g_9 SO WITH THE MICROWAVE YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO A LOT AUTOMATIC US SETTINGS OR YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO SOME MANUAL SETTINGS INCLUDING EVEN DO IT AND THE LIGHT TIME
GCJfvlG3B_g_10 SO IF YOU'VE IN WHAT ARE MY QUICK MOBBER AN HOUR AND ACTUALLY SET THIS BLADE TIMING
GCJfvlG3B_g_11 I'M TIM GIBSON AS I USE A MICROWAVE

gSBb8mSo9Ao_1 I'M JENNIFER MILLER WITH INSTITUTE FOR REALITY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
gSBb8mSo9Ao_2 ONE OF THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS THAT WE GET FROM FAMILIES THAT ARE NEW HOME SCHOOLING OVER SKEPTICAL OF HOME SCHOOLING IS HOW YOU TEACH THIS THING THE YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT
gSBb8mSo9Ao_3 IF YOU FAIL HIGH SCHOOL GEOGRAPHY IN YOU CAN NAME ALL THE STATES IN CAPITALS YOU DON'T KNOW WITH THE SEVEN CONTINENT'S ARE THEN HOW ARE YOU POSSIBLY AND TEACH JARVI TO YOUR CHILD AT HOME
gSBb8mSo9Ao_4 A CRESCENT CAN BE ASKED IN RESPONSE AND THAT IS IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE CAPITAL BRAZIL IS HOW TO FIND OUT
gSBb8mSo9Ao_5 THAT WAS YOUR ANSWER
gSBb8mSo9Ao_6 WHICH YOU SEARCH ON GOOGLE
gSBb8mSo9Ao_7 WHICH ELABORATE
gSBb8mSo9Ao_8 BUDGIES ANALYSIS
gSBb8mSo9Ao_9 ANY OF THOSE AND THAT WOULD NOT ONLY PROVIDING ANSWER TO WITH CAPITAL BRAZIL IS THAT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE THE ANSWER TO HOW TO TEACH GEOGRAPHY WHEN YOU YOURSELF DON'T KNOW
gSBb8mSo9Ao_10 IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY PERSONS YOU TEACH THE WHOLE BODY HUMAN KNOWLEDGE TO ANOTHER PERSON
gSBb8mSo9Ao_11 AND THOSE EXPONENTIALLY EVERY YEAR
gSBb8mSo9Ao_12 AND IN ADVOCATE PERSON IS NOT SOMEONE WHO KNOWS ALL OF THE BURDEN FACTS ABOUT EVERY SUBJECT
gSBb8mSo9Ao_13 AN EDUCATED PERSON IS SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO LEARN AND HE WAS A LIFE STYLE OF LEARNING
gSBb8mSo9Ao_14 SO IF YOU ARE AN EDUCATED PERSON IN YOU KNOW HOW TO LEARN IN YOU WILL KNOW HOW TO FIND THE INFORMATION THAT YOU KNOW NOW
gSBb8mSo9Ao_15 ONE OF THE WAYS THAT IS ON WE TEACH THE SEVENTH THAT WE ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH AN WE'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH HIS LIFE FINDING SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO TEACH THOSE THINGS AND TEACHING INTO OUR CHILDREN
gSBb8mSo9Ao_16 DESIGNING EDUCATION IS NOT SO MUCH ABOUT WHAT TO INCLUDE AS TO WHAT NOT TO INCLUDE
gSBb8mSo9Ao_17 IF IT'S A PUBLIC EDUCATION OF FIVE EDUCATIONAL HOME EDUCATION SOMEONE HAS MADE THE DECISION OF WHAT IS IMPORTANT FOR A CHILD TO LEARN AT A CERTAIN POINT AND HOW TO TEACH A AND WHAT IT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE OUT
gSBb8mSo9Ao_18 HOW MEDICATING A CHILD IS NOT ABOUT KNOWING EVERYTHING AND KNOWING HOW TO TEACH EVERYTHING YOURSELF
gSBb8mSo9Ao_19 IT'S ABOUT CUSTOM DESIGNING A PERFECT EDUCATION FOR YOUR CHILD AT THE STATES THAT HE IS THAT
gSBb8mSo9Ao_20 IF TEACHING GEOGRAPHY SCARES YOU'VE MADE FRIENDS THAT HERE ATLAS
gSBb8mSo9Ao_21 START DOING SOME READING ABOUT CULTURES
gSBb8mSo9Ao_22 START LEARNING LANGUAGE
gSBb8mSo9Ao_23 IN THE FOR VERY LONG YOUR ENTHUSIASM FOR THE WHAT YOU ARE LEARNING WILL OVERFLOW IN YOUR HOME SCHOOL
gSBb8mSo9Ao_24 AND YOU WILL FIND WAYS TO TEACH A CHILD GEOGRAPHY

GZUw7MFvOwA_1 HI THIS IS BRUCE LESSELS FROM ZOAR OUTDOOR ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE DOT COM TALKING ABOUT LOWERING LOW IMPACT CAMPING METHODS
GZUw7MFvOwA_2 THE HUMAN YOU MAKE A MAJOR EFFORT TO HAVE IS LOW IMPACT IS IT CAN WHEN YOU'RE CAMPING YOU STILL HAVE SOME IMPACT ON THE GROUND ON THE AREA WHERE YOU ARE AND THAT THEY'RE COUPLE WAYS TO RETURN IT TO A NO MORE LESS IS ORIGINAL STATE
GZUw7MFvOwA_3 OF COURSE AGAIN TAKE OUT EVERYTHING IN BRING IN SONY'S ANY FOOD WAY SEE THOSE THINGS IN A TAKE YET BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN STILL TELL THAT THIS AREA IS BEEN WALK DON ENCAMPED ON AND THE SOMEONE SPEND THE NIGHT HERE
GZUw7MFvOwA_4 SO ONE WAY THAT THOSE START TO BRING THIS TO THE AREA BACK IS JUDGES LUSTER WAY SOME <UNK> INCH <UNK> HEELS AND LEAVES AND THINGS <UNK> THOSE BACK IN THE HOLLOWS
GZUw7MFvOwA_5 PALMS IS IN EXCITED TRY TO OF RESTORE SOME THAT GROUND COVER FLAKED THE WAY IT WAS AND GOTH IF YOU MOVE LOGS IF YOU USE LOGS TO SIT ON AROUND A CAMPFIRE OF USING THE SIT ON A THICK AS CAMS TOOLS ON TRY TO MOVE THOSE BACK TO WHERE YOU FOUND WORK THE BACK OF THE WOOD SO THEY'RE NOT AN OBVIOUS PATTERN ON THAT YOU'VE CREATED
GZUw7MFvOwA_6 BASICALLY TRITON MINIMIZE WILL BE IMPACTS OF IT THE CAMPSITE LOOKS IN AND THAT IS THE WAY IS MY AS MUCH AWAY FOUNDED AS POSSIBLE WHEN YOU'RE DONE
HCoR8_tnEd4_1 I WANT THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ON MASS BY PATIENCES WHAT I DO NOT I'VE MADE AN APPOINTMENT
HCoR8_tnEd4_2 THEY FOUND THAT ACUPUNCTURIST YOU WHEN YOU GO TO FOR THE FIRST TIME IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET A FEW THINGS TOGETHER AND YOU'RE PREPARED FOR THAT FIRST TREATMENTS THAT YOU GET THE GREATEST BENEFIT AND SUCCESS FROM THAT TREATMENT
HCoR8_tnEd4_3 FOR THE FIRST THINGS I WOULD RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE IS THE GATHER TOGETHER THE PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY ANY SUPPLEMENTS THEY'RE TAKING
HCoR8_tnEd4_4 IF YOU'RE ALREADY TAKEN ANY HERBS OR VITAMINS MAKE SURE THAT YOU BRING THEM WITH YOU TO THE PRACTITIONER
HCoR8_tnEd4_5 BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'VE GOT A QUALITY CONTROL CHECKED GOING ON IN ALSO BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKELY TO PRESCRIBE SOME SUPPLEMENTATION FOR YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO INTERFERE WITH ANY THE SUPPLEMENT ARE CURRENTLY TAKING
HCoR8_tnEd4_6 OFTEN TIMES YOU DO HAVE TO DO IS ROLL OF DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF TREATMENT
HCoR8_tnEd4_7 SO IF YOU'RE ON COMFORTABLE WITH THAT ARE ALL MAKE SURE THAT YOU WEAR SOME VERY LOOSE CLOTHING THAT CAN BE MOVED SO THAT THEY CAN GET THE AREAS FOR ACUPUNCTURE
HCoR8_tnEd4_8 MANY ACUPUNCTURE TREATMENT FOCUS ON AREAS BELOW THE ELBOW AND BELOW THE KNEES
HCoR8_tnEd4_9 SO THEY'RE ABLE TO ROLL UP YOUR PANT LEG OR PUSH UP YOUR SLEEVES WILL BE MUCH EASIER FOR THE ACUPUNCTURIST TO GET TO THAT AREA
HCoR8_tnEd4_10 IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO AVOID ANY COLOR LIQUIDS A FEW HOURS BEFORE YOUR TREATMENT
HCoR8_tnEd4_11 YOUR PRACTITIONER WILL BE LOOKING AT YOUR TONG TO SEE WHETHER THERE'S ANY CHANGES IN THAT
HCoR8_tnEd4_12 SO IF YOU HAD COFFEE OR TEA BEFORE YOUR TREATMENT YOU MIGHT FOOL THEM BY HAVING A YELLOW OR COATING ON YOUR TONGUE
HCoR8_tnEd4_13 IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO EAT SOME FOOD BEFORE YOU GO IS YOU DON'T WANT THE HUNGARY AND ANXIOUS BEFORE YOU GO
HCoR8_tnEd4_14 SO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR NORMAL NAILS OPEN IT'S NOT TOO FULL AND NOT RIGHT BEFORE YOU WALK IN
HCoR8_tnEd4_15 SO THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO ENJOY YOUR TREATMENT AND GET THE MOST BENEFIT OUT OF IT
HCoR8_tnEd4_16 MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO RELAX AND HAVE A GOOD TIME I'M PROVIDE THE PRACTITIONER WITH LOTS OF DETAIL INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN GIVE YOU THE FASTEST AND BEST PROGRESS THEY CAN BE HAND FROM THE TREATMENTS

GSx_C8A3iWY_9 YOU CAN GET WITH ONLY EACH EACHAN A IN THE FAKIE THAT'S COOL THAT MEANS THAT THEY'RE ONLY PRESCRIBE EACH ENGINE FULL YOU PULL THE TREATMENT OR YOU CAN GET COMBINATION OKLAHOMANS IN THE THERAPY WHICH IS E SHOOTING COMBINED WITH OTHER PARTICULAR OF HOMEOWNERS LYCRA JESTER OWN E STRING PROGESTIN AND TESTOSTERONE
GSx_C8A3iWY_10 THIS COMBINATION IS ACTUALLY A MORE RECOMMENDED BECAUSE THEN YOU GO TO DECREASE YOUR ALONG EXPOSURE ALL THE SHIN OHIO EXPOSURE TO ASIAN IN THE BODY WILL IN A POSITION BECAUSE ON A POSE EACHAN WHICH TOO HIGH WRIST ABOUT BEING CERTAIN COUNTS AS A AND NEUTRAL CAN SET
GSx_C8A3iWY_11 SO COMBINATION FAKIE IS USUALLY WILL THEN THE ONE RECOMMENDATION FOR WOMEN AND TO MANIPLES
GSx_C8A3iWY_12 NOW A CHALK TEA IS GOOD BECAUSE IT HELPS THE WOMEN IN DEVIATE SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS AULTMAN A POOL OF AND THAT IS IT HOUSE OF NEW SWINGS AND AND HOT FLASHES
GSx_C8A3iWY_13 IT ALSO HELPS THE WOMEN TO AND MAINTAINS THE MEMORY BECAUSE MANNA POOL IS WHEN A STOCK TO LOSE MEMORY AND THE AND THAT'S THE AS ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS

GSx_C8A3iWY_20 ON THE LAST INDUCED YOU KNOW IS SYNTHETIC RAISE NOT NOT FULL SO THE OTHER OF SCHEDULES THE CONTINUOUS SCHEDULE WHICH MEANS THAT YOU BASICALLY TAKING EACH EACH AND EVERY
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_1 HI I'M AARON GREGORY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_2 WE'RE IN A TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS A NEW CAR BATTERY DIES HOW TO SELECT A NEW BATTERY AND ADD A C WITH PROBLEMS
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_3 WE'LL BEGIN BY REMOVING THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL FROM THE BATTERY AND GETTING IT OUT OF THE WAYS THAT DOES NOT STAY TOUCHING IN CONTACTED
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_4 AND THEN WE'LL REMOVE THE POSITIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_5 ALLOW OUT WAS TOO LOOSE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_6 THIS TERMINAL MIGHT STAY CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IF YOU DON'T BEND IT OUT OF THE WAY A LITTLE IN WHICH CASE WE MIGHT STILL HAVE THE SPARKING FROM
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_7 SO AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S THE EARLY OUT AWAY
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_8 AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO THIS ONE LOOSENING AND SOMETIMES IS TERMINAL BE STOCK REALLY TIGHT
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_9 NOW THE MAKEUP TO HOLD THE BATTERY TERMINAL VOELLER THAT HAS A THREADED ROD AND A LITTLE PLUNGER IN YOU SCREW IT DOWN AND LIFT THE THING UP
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_10 WITHOUT HAVING THE SPECIAL TOOL IS A SLOT YEAR
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_11 IF YOU OPEN THE THREADED ROD AND USE A TOOL TO SPREAD THESE THESE YEARS THEY GET PINCHED TOGETHER AND THEN YOU LIFT THE FRONT OF THE TERMINAL GENTLY
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_12 YOU CAN USUALLY GET IT OFF
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_13 WHEN REMOVING TERMINALS BOTH SIDES LOOK COLLECTIBLE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_14 BUT YOU WON A TURN THE KNOT SIDE AND LOOSEN THE KNOT SIDE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_15 BECAUSE THIS WEARABLE THAT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO ROTATE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_16 IF THEY STATION
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_17 I'LL LOOSE IN A LITTLE MORE THAN YOU THINK YOU NEED TO BE DON'T TAKE THE NOT ALL THE WAY OFF
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_18 THAT WAY YOU HAVE SOME CLEARANCE DOES BREAD THE LEAD OPEN TO GET THE TERMINAL OFF THE BATTERY
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_19 <UNK> FRET AND TWIST IT
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_20 IF IT WON'T WITH YOU MIGHT NEED TO OPEN THIS GAP HERE SLIGHTLY WITH YOUR WRENCH OR A SCREWDRIVER
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_21 OPEN THE OPEN THE RING TO MAKE IT LARGER
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_22 AND THEN TWIST THE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_24 IF NECESSARY TO PRY A LITTLE WITH
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_25 IF YOU'RE GOING TO FRY THE TERMINAL UP LIFT EVENLY SO THAT YOU DON'T BREAK THE LEAD TERMINAL OFF OF THE BATTERY
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_26 NOW THAT THE TERMINALS ARE OFF THE BATTERY WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANY SIGNS A WHITE CORROSION OR BROWN ROT
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_27 OFF AND THE SAME GOES FOR THE INSIDE LOOP ON THE CAR AND THE TERMINAL THE FEMALE PSI
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_28 TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE THAT HAVE A WIRE BRUSH THAT STICK SANDING YOU ROTATE TO CLEAN THE FEMALE SIDE
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_29 AND THEN THERE'S ALSO MATING FEMALE WIRE BRUSH THE GOES OVER THE TERMINAL THAT YOU CAN TWIST
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_30 SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
GfB5Y3lrD3Q_31 I LIKE TO USE A WIRE BRUSH AND SCRUB THE TERMINALS UNTIL I SEE SHINY CLEAN LEAD

gEiZVZqjGOk_2 LET'S SAY YOU GET A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH BLOND ONE SPOT
gEiZVZqjGOk_3 WHAT YOU DO

gEiZVZqjGOk_10 LET IT PROCESS AND THEN SHAMPOO OUT AND THAT YOU'LL HAVE IMMEDIATELY AND IT'S AN INSTANT LOW LIGHTS
gBX_yK0IkWY_1 AND THEN BEGIN TO TREAT THAT'S EARS
gBX_yK0IkWY_2 WE HAVE A STERILE PROBE ON THE END OF THIS IT'LL HOLTORF AND THEN I'VE KNOW WHERE THE PROBLEM AS AN EDIT TILT HIS YEAR THE WAY I HAVE TO GO

GuTCs8WJ2Kg_5 THREE IS ABOUT THIS HIGH AND A FIVE IS WHAT I LIKE THAT
GuTCs8WJ2Kg_6 THE FIVE SIX FIVE BEATS IN THE AIR OF THREE THREE AND ONE TAKES ONE B

GuTCs8WJ2Kg_14 WAS REALLY ADD EXAM SLING ONE STRAIGHT UP IN EACH HAND AND THIS BRIGHT GREEN ONE IS PASSING IN BETWEEN IF OF
GuTCs8WJ2Kg_15 THIS IF THAT'S NOT REAL OF IT THAT WILL REALLY HELP IF WE HAVE A FOURTH OF FAT
_hg5i_FMbeY_1 IN THIS SECTION WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS SOME METHODS YOU CAN USE IN DEALING WITH TOUGH CUSTOMERS
_hg5i_FMbeY_2 I'M PAM UNRUH ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
_hg5i_FMbeY_3 NOW AS WE TALK ABOUT TOUGH CUSTOMERS IN DEALING WITH TOUGH CUSTOMERS IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER DOCUMENT EVERYTHING
_hg5i_FMbeY_4 JUST AS IT'S IMPORTANT TO PUT NOTES AND CUSTOMERS FINAL EVERY TIME YOU SERVICE SYSTEM OR HEALTH PICK SOMETHING WITH THE CUSTOMER IT'S MORE IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING UNPLEASANT LIKE THIS HAPPEN PHYSICAL VIEWS OR THE BIRTLE ABUSIVE PROFANITY BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HAVE THAT BACK YOU UP AN TO PROTECT YOURSELF
_hg5i_FMbeY_5 NOW IT'S TELLING YOU ABOUT A CUSTOMER AND BE OUT OUR SERVICE MINUTE OF FRONT DOOR IT WASN'T TWO MONTHS LATER THAT WE WERE CONTACT AND BUY AN ATTORNEY THAT THIS GENTLEMAN HANDS HIRED AND THE HE WAS BASICALLY SUING US BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO SERVICES EQUIPMENT
_hg5i_FMbeY_6 ALL OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT HAPPENS THAT DAY WERE VERY CAREFULLY DOCUMENTED AND THEY WERE CHECK FOR ACCURACY THEY DON'T PUT IN HIS FILE AND NOT ONLY THAT THEY ARE ALSO THE MOUNT OTHER SOURCES WHO MIGHT HAVE YOUR WHO HAD A NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS TYPE OF THING
_hg5i_FMbeY_7 SO I HAD A VERY GOOD AND PAPER TRAIL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED I HAD STATEMENTS FROM THE SERVICEMEN AND I ALSO HAVE DATES AND TIMES STAMPED ON THE EMAILS
_hg5i_FMbeY_8 SO IN THESE WERE IN TURN PROVIDED TO THE ATTORNEY WHO IS VERY EMBARRASSED YOU HAVE GOT INVOLVED IN SUCH A SITUATION OF COURSE CONTRITE BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW OVALS STORY AND THAT IS ESSENTIALLY THAT USE THAT WHOLE SITUATION
_hg5i_FMbeY_9 WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT IN MORE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT DOCUMENT THESE TYPES OF THINGS SO THAT THE NEXT PERSON TO DEAL WITH THE CUSTOMER NOSE THAN WHAT TYPE OF CUSTOMER THEIR DEALING WITH
_hg5i_FMbeY_10 THAT MAY SEQUENCER DEFENSES UP A LITTLE BIT AND YOU SHOULDN'T PROBABLY DO THAT WITH MANY CUSTOMERS WOULD HAVE CUSTOMERS ACROSS THIS KIND OF LINE YOU NEED TO BE AWARE IT'S FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY
gijA72RgBqM_1 HI I'M GARY FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
gijA72RgBqM_2 NOW THAT OUR ACHES HAVE BEEN SITTING IN THE DYE SOLUTION ON A LOW FLAME FOR ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT OFF THE FIRE AND WE NEED TO TAKE THE EGGS OUT OF THE POT AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT THAT ASIDE TO LET THEM COOL
gijA72RgBqM_3 WE CAN SEE THAT THE COLOR AS DEATHLY CHANGED REALLY HAS A NICE SO RICH COLOR
gijA72RgBqM_4 AND ALSO WE CAN SEE THE IMAGE INSIDE IS STILL VERY HARD PRESS TO THE SURFACE OF THE A
gijA72RgBqM_5 SO AROUND THE CIRCLE THE PRECAUTIONS OF WE TOOK EARLIER TO SECURE THE EGGS IN THE SOLUTION AND IN THE MEDIA ASKIN'S OF THE ONION HAVE REALLY ON HOPELESS ACHIEVE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WHICH IS A REALLY NICE IMAGE ON THE A
gijA72RgBqM_6 SO AS WE TAKE THE EGGS OUT WE CAN SEE THAT THE ON THE IMAGES ARE INTACT AND THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH DONE IN THE SAME PLACE THAT WE'VE LET THEM KNOW WHEN IT WHEN WE ORIGINALLY PLACE THEM AND SO ONCE THE EQUAL IN REAL AND TAKE THE THE ON THE PANTYHOSE OFF
gijA72RgBqM_7 THEY COME OUT OF THE THE VENUE ROSEN WILL BE ABLE TO OPEN THEM UP AND SEE WILL BUILD TO SEE THE IMAGE ACTUALLY ON THE A
HE5tiPfCQIo_1 I'M DOING A DEMONSTRATION FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND IN ONE A ONE
HE5tiPfCQIo_2 THE FIRST STEP IN MOST IMPORTANT STEP THE PAINTING IS THE PREPARATION
HE5tiPfCQIo_3 HERE WE'RE DOING IS TAKING OFF THE MOLDING WHERE YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY
HE5tiPfCQIo_4 WHAT THEY DO IS WHEN YOU'RE PAINTING WITH THE ROLLER ISN'T INTONATION TO GO IN PAIN ALWAY UP TO THE TAPE BLOCK WE REALLY SHOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THE MORE PAINT YOU PUT ON THE TAPE YOU CREATE A SEAL SO THAT WHEN YOU PULL THE TAPE BACK YOU WIND UP PULLING THE PAINT AND MESSING UP A LOT OF GOOD WORK
HE5tiPfCQIo_5 SO YOU REALLY WANT A FAINT TO ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH AWAY FROM YOUR TAPE LINE AND THEN FINISH THAT FAR WITH THE BRUSH
HE5tiPfCQIo_6 YOU ALSO WANT ALWAYS USE SMOOTH EASY EASY STROKES AND BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVER PAINT YOUR OF PREPARATION LIE
GS8ijsnoJjA_1 AND THE DRINK WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE IS CALLED BITTERSWEET WITH A TWIST
GS8ijsnoJjA_2 AND PUT OUR ICE IN A GLASS HERE
GS8ijsnoJjA_3 AND WHEN IT TAKE ONE SHOT OF TEQUILA AND ANY TO KILL WORK
GS8ijsnoJjA_4 I FIND IT IN EVERY MIX IN A TEQUILA WITH AGE USE REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT KIND OF USE BECAUSE THAT USED IN OVERPOWER MOST OF THE TASTE THE TEQUILA AND WAYS
GS8ijsnoJjA_5 SO WITH ONE SHOT OF TEQUILA AND OF FILTER REST THE WAY WITH GRAPEFRUIT JUICE AND GO VERY NICE THEM AND LET'S MIX THIS UP REAL GOOD
GS8ijsnoJjA_6 FLEAS HAS THESE FLUTE IS A SLEEVE FLEECE FLEW THIS FOR FIZZY FLEAS USED THAT FLIP THE FIELD COULD HAVE A NICE HOW THE CONTROL OVER THE BITTERNESS OF THAT GRAPEFRUIT JUICE
GS8ijsnoJjA_7 SO OR GLASS HER HAND FOR MEN GIVE A STRAW AND GARNISH IT WITH A LEMON
GS8ijsnoJjA_8 AND WE GO ON TOP
h8dHMToYurY_1 HI I'M IDENTICAL WHETHER THEY'RE ON THE <UNK>
h8dHMToYurY_2 AND I'M GOING TO GET YOU SECOND WITH THE OF AGAIN WITH THE CDS
h8dHMToYurY_3 LAST ERIC TO YOU ABOUT DOES BOOT AGAIN WITH THE AND THEN THE LOOK THAT HAND TO LEARN THE KNEES DIFFERENT WOULD NEED THIS BECOMES VERY THAT IN
h8dHMToYurY_4 THE SECOND ONE ONE OF AGAIN WITH THESE
h8dHMToYurY_5 WAS IT LENGTH OF IS I'M BEN AND YOU CAN HAVE A STATE OF A PATTERN
h8dHMToYurY_6 ISN'T THAT OUT AND INNINGS IT AT
h8dHMToYurY_7 IF YOU WANT IT THE OF THE SIDE ENOUGH IN THE HIGHEST IF OUT IN A MINUTE VISION
h8dHMToYurY_8 THIS ONE THE HAS BEEN ISN'T INVOLVE THAT
h8dHMToYurY_9 IF THE IN AND OUT OF THE OVEN ON MY WAND AND THAT AND THAT IS WHAT THE
h8dHMToYurY_10 MOST OF THEM USED TO REMAIN IN THIS WITH THEM
h8dHMToYurY_11 AND IF YOU HAVE ONE PRACTICE AND A SPEECH AND ENHANCEMENT FLOOR YOU HAVE TO <UNK> YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT IS OF FROM THEM LOAD IT USES
h8dHMToYurY_12 THE RECORD THAT YEARS OF

h8dHMToYurY_14 SO PRACTICE THIS MUDRA AND FEEL ADVANCEMENT
gyuT7GyYraA_1 MY NAME IS CHRISTINE MARQUETTE AND I'M A REGISTERED DIETITIAN WITH THE AUSTIN REGIONAL CLINIC AND I'M GONNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW TO BUY VALLEY FREE PRODUCTS
gyuT7GyYraA_2 BALANCE OR A CHEMICAL THAT ARE TYPICALLY FOUND IN PLASTICS THEY CAN BE USED TO INCREASE THEIR FLEXIBILITY
gyuT7GyYraA_3 BUT THEY'RE ALSO FOUND IN A VARIETY OF OTHER PRODUCTS
gyuT7GyYraA_4 PERSONAL CARE ITEMS FOR EXAMPLE THEY CAN BE FOUND IN NAIL POLISH DEODORANT HAIRSPRAY PERFUMES VARIOUS TYPES OF PAINTS
gyuT7GyYraA_5 THEY'RE ALSO FOUND IN PESTICIDES EM PLASTICS THINGS LIKE PVC HEIGHTS PC THAT ALSO USED IN FLOORING IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS
gyuT7GyYraA_6 THE REASON WHY THERE'S THEN INCREASE INTEREST AND FINDING PRODUCTS THAT DON'T HAVE VALLEYS IS BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN SOME RESEARCH SHOWING THAT THERE'S A INCREASED RISK OF BURRS BIRTH DEFECTS LIVER CANCER KIDNEY PROBLEMS ANOTHER HORMONAL IMBALANCES THE LABORATORY ANIMALS
gyuT7GyYraA_7 SO FOR THIS REASON A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED WITH THEIR EXPOSURE TO BALANCE
gyuT7GyYraA_8 ANOTHER CAUSE OF CONCERN IS THAT THE CD SEATED A RANDOM SAMPLE OF ADULT LIMON OF CHILDBEARING AGE AND FOUND THAT A LOT OF THEM HAVE I THINK IT IS OVER SEVENTY PERCENT HAD MORE THAN THE RECOMMENDED LEVEL OF VALLEY IT'S CIRCULATING IN THE BLOODSTREAM
gyuT7GyYraA_9 BECAUSE THIS PARTICULAR CHEMICAL IS QUITE UBIQUITOUS IT'S FOUND EVERYWHERE
gyuT7GyYraA_10 SO ONE OF THE WAYS THAT YOU CAN GO ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT YOUR PRODUCTS ARE VALLEY FREE IS SPECIFICALLY LIVE IN THE INGREDIENTS FOR THAT PARTICULAR WORD
gyuT7GyYraA_11 THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT ESTERS IT MAY BE OF MULTI SYLLABLE WORD THAT ALWAYS LOOK FOR THE VALLEY AS THE ENDING
gyuT7GyYraA_12 THERE MAY ALSO BE SOME THEY'RE JUST USING STRAIGHT ABBREVIATIONS
gyuT7GyYraA_13 THE ABBREVIATIONS TO LOOK FOR WOULD BE D E HP
gyuT7GyYraA_14 THAT STANDS FOR DIED TO EXEL HEXCEL
gyuT7GyYraA_15 VALLEY ANOTHER ABBREVIATION IS D I D KEY
gyuT7GyYraA_16 THAT STANDS FOR DIE ALSO THE AXLE
gyuT7GyYraA_17 OUR WEIGHT AND THEN D I IN P
gyuT7GyYraA_18 THAT STANDS FOR DIE ALSO NOT ALL VALLEY
gyuT7GyYraA_19 SO IF YOU SEE ANY OF THOSE ABBREVIATIONS YOU KNOW THAT THAT PARTICULAR PRODUCT STILL HASS VALLEYS IN IT
gyuT7GyYraA_20 MANY MANUFACTURERS WHO MAY KNOW POLISH IN HAIRSPRAY THOSE KIND OF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS ARE VERY HAPPY TO ADVERTISE THAT THEY HAVE PRODUCTS THAT ARE
g50rCJZrX0k_1 MY NAME IS JOHN THEN ABRUPT AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I WANT YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT BEGINNING ENCAUSTIC PAINTING
g50rCJZrX0k_2 A HOT TOOLS THAT I MENTIONED THAT YOU NEED TO USE THIS EUROPEAN STYLE METHOD OF ENCAUSTIC PAINTING WOULD START WITH THE MAIN TOOL WOULD BE AN IRON LIKE THIS TRAVELING IN SIZE
g50rCJZrX0k_3 IT IS DESIGNED FOR ENCAUSTIC PAINTING
g50rCJZrX0k_4 YOU COULD TRY TO FIND OUT ON A SMALL IRON AT HOME TO TRY THIS IF YOU WOULD WANT A STEAM I'M THAT HAVE HOLES IN THE SERVICE AND YOU WOULDN'T WANT TEFLON COATED IRON
g50rCJZrX0k_5 AND THE OTHER TOOL WOULD BE A STYLUS WHICH HAS A A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT POINTS THAT CAN BE PUT IN THE FRONT ALL OPERATING AT A LOW TEMPERATURE AROUND TWO HUNDRED DEGREES
g50rCJZrX0k_6 SO DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS LIKE A WOOD BURNING TOOL THAT WOULD BE MUCH TO HOP TO WORK WITH WITH WAX AND ACTUALLY COULD CAUSE THE WAX TO CATCH ON FIRE
g50rCJZrX0k_7 THE THING ABOUT THIS TRIANGLE LINE IS THAT IT CAN BE EACH JULIE ASSEMBLED INTO A HOT PLATES OR YOU CAN WORK WITH HOT PIEPER INSTEAD OF USING AN AS AN EYE
g50rCJZrX0k_8 AND THEN ANOTHER CHINA THING THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO LOOK AT IS THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF WAXES WHICH ARE GOING TO I USE
g50rCJZrX0k_9 THESE PARTICULAR WAXES COME IN THREE DIFFERENT SETS OF COLORS AND HIGH ALL OF THIS COMES FROM THE NETHERLANDS
g50rCJZrX0k_10 IF YOU'LL NOTICE THESE ARE QUITE SMALL SIZES OF THESE BLOCKS
g50rCJZrX0k_11 A TRADITIONAL AND CAUSING PAINTER NEEDS HUGE BLOCKS OF WAX TO PUT IN POTS AND MELT AND THEREFORE IT'S A MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THIS PROCESS
g50rCJZrX0k_12 WHEN YOU GET ALL THROUGH PAINTING YOU DON'T WANT TO PROTECT YOUR PAINTING WITH THE SEALER OF SOME KIND AND THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY KINDS OF SEALERS YOU CAN USE
g50rCJZrX0k_13 ANOTHER TOOL THAT I USE IS A HOT HERE YOU HAVE TO TO BLOW THE WAX AROUND
g50rCJZrX0k_14 NOW THIS IS A REAL COMMERCIAL MODEL THAT I GOT FROM SEARS BUT I LIKE IT BECAUSE I CAN DIAL THE TEMPERATURE IN EXACTLY THE WAY ON IT AND ALSO CONTROL THE AIR FLOW
g50rCJZrX0k_15 WHEN I STARTED I HAD TO USE A HAIR DRYER WHICH WAS OKAY BUT IT'S A LOT OF AIR AND NOT ENOUGH HEAT AND THEN THERE'S A THIN CALLING EMBOSSING DOWN THAT'S GETS US SCRAPBOOK REVIEWS AND AGAIN THAT'S TOO MUCH HEAT IN ON THE THINNER YOU CAN WORK TO TOGETHER WITH THAT GETS TO BE A LITTLE CUMBERSOME SO AT SOME POINT YOU MIGHT INVEST IN A HEAVIER DUTY TOOL LIKE THIS
g50rCJZrX0k_16 AND THAT PRETTY MUCH COVERS THE TOOLS
GGqBF3C0vak_1 THE ANTIQUE YOUR DOG TO WORK ON A TREADMILL SO THEY CAN GET THAT EXERCISE IN YOU HAVE A SMALL AREA WHICH TO EXERCISE YOUR DOG OR UNPLEASANT WHETHER OR THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO DO THE EXERCISE INSIDE FIRST YOU'D ONE AQUA MAJOR DOG TO THE APPARATUS
GGqBF3C0vak_2 YOU WANT YOUR DOG TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH STANDING ON THE TREADMILL AND I HAVE BEING OR ROUND THE TREADMILL MIDI HEARING THE SOUND OF IT RUNNING BEFORE YOUR DOG'S ACTUALLY STANDING ON A TREADMILL WHEN IT STARTS TO MOVE
GGqBF3C0vak_3 SO YOU MIGHT BEGIN BY OKAY UP <UNK> TEACHING YOUR DOG TO GET OUT ON THE TREADMILL AND STANDING THERE AND THEN BEING ABLE TO GET BACK OFF OF THE TREAD NOW THE FLORAL OFF BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY WORK UP TO THE POINT WHERE YOU TURN THE TREADMILL ON IN YOUR DOG BEGINS TO FOR WALK
GGqBF3C0vak_4 THIS IS AN ACTIVITY THAT IS POTENTIALLY VIEW YOUR INDUCING FOR YOUR DOG SEE ONE WORK SLOWLY AND TRY NOT TO HAVE ANY ACCIDENTS WORRIER DOG ACTUALLY IS THROWN FROM THE TREADMILL WHICH WOULD MAKE YOUR DOG MUCH MORE WARY ABOUT PUTTING FOOT ON AGAIN
GGqBF3C0vak_5 IN ONE WORK VERY SLOWLY INITIALLY GETTING THEM ON TO THE TREADMILL THEN RUNNING IT VERY SLOWLY STEER DOG UNDERSTANDS THEY HAVE TO WALK ALWAYS BEING EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS TO KEEP ALL FOUR FEET ON THE TREADMILL
GGqBF3C0vak_6 NOW REMEMBER THAT DOGS WILL WORK TYPICALLY WITHOUT QUITTING WHEN THEY'VE GOTTEN TO TIRED SEAM ONE IN THE VERY I KNOWLEDGEABLE OF YOUR DOG'S HEALTH THEIR HEART HEALTH AND A FIVE WHEN TO STOP HOW LONG THE BACON EXERCISE AND THAT'S A REALLY GOOD AND WORK WITH A PROFESSIONAL ON AND WITH YOUR VETERINARIAN
GwXNlblxiFY_1 IT'S A MOTHER EARLY ELECTRIC CLOCKS WHICHEVER MORE AND MORE NOW PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO APPRECIATE ESPECIALLY SINCE PLUGIN CLOCKS PRETTY MUCH OR THING OF THE PASS NOW WITH THE BATTERY CLOCKS KICKING THEIR PLACE
GwXNlblxiFY_2 TELECTRON IS REALLY THE COMPANY THAT TIP PERFECTED PLUGIN CLOCKS
GwXNlblxiFY_3 BEFORE THAT YOU HAVE THE PROBLEM OF WITH OUR INTERRUPTIONS
GwXNlblxiFY_4 YOUR CLOCK WOODEN RESTARTS OR WOULD START AGAIN IN YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT DID THE OTHER THAN A POWER INTERRUPTION WOULD BE SAYING THE WRONG TIME
GwXNlblxiFY_5 SO IF THE WORN TELECTRON COMPANY TO COORDINATE WITH THE POWER COMPANIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING A SIXTY CYCLE OUR
GwXNlblxiFY_6 AND AS LONG AS SIXTY CYCLE POWER CAME FROM THE LINES YOUR CLOCK WAS CAN BE ACCURATE KAZOO IS IN HERE AND TO TURN INTO A CONVERT AT SIXTY CYCLE POWER INTO ACCURATE THAT TIME KEEPING AN ELECTRIC CLOCK
GwXNlblxiFY_7 AS EARLY ONES IN BEAUTIFUL WOODEN CASES
GwXNlblxiFY_8 SO OF THEIR ATTRACTIVE TO LOOK AT
GwXNlblxiFY_9 OFTEN IF YOU'RE UNSURE ABOUT WHETHER THE TELECTRON ELECTRIC MOTOR AND THERE IS ANY GOOD OR THAT HAS THE WORKING IT CAN BE CONVERTED OF BATTERY
GwXNlblxiFY_10 YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE CHORD BUT THAT YOU CAN STILL ENJOY THE AESTHETICS OF THEM OF WE HAVE
GwXNlblxiFY_11 THEY OF OF WITH AGAIN A BOOK BY GYM LANDS ON NONE OF THESE TELECTRON CLOCKS
GwXNlblxiFY_12 HELICON LATER BECAME PART OF G E BUT THEY WITH THOUSANDS OF STYLES AND HE'S ASSIGNED THE CONTEMPORARY COLLECTING VALUES TO THEM AS WELL
GwXNlblxiFY_13 SO THIS GIVES YOU A GUIDE AT LEAST OF WHICH ONES ARE RARE AND WHICH ONES ARE MORE MORE COMMON
GwXNlblxiFY_14 THE FINAL THING TO NOTE IN SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER IN THE PAST TWO OF THESE TELECTRON CAULK CLOCKS ALWAYS HAD A LITTLE CORE HOLE IN THE DIAL WHICH WOULD SHOW RED IF THE IF THE OF OUR HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
GwXNlblxiFY_15 THE CLOCK WOULD RESTART BUT IT LEAVES YOU KNOW THAT THE CLOTH THE OUR WAS OFFER MINUTE OR FIVE HOURS AND YOU WOULD NO LONGER TRUST THE TIME THAT THE CLOCK SHOWS
GwXNlblxiFY_16 AS SOON AS YOU RESET O'CLOCK THAT RED DOT GOES AWAY UNTIL THE NEXT TIME THE POWER GOES OFF

h9PawU0t-ys_1 OFTEN TROPOPAUSE TYPICALLY HAVE ROUGH WATER SWIM AND THAT'S WHEN THE HOME ARMS OF THE OFFER TRIATHLON
h9PawU0t-ys_2 TO PREPARE FOR THAT THERE'S REALLY NOTHING YOU CAN DO OTHER THAN SWIM ENOUGH WATER
h9PawU0t-ys_3 IF YOU HAVE A LOCAL TRAP LONG CLUB IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO LAY ON WHEN YOU'RE A BEACH ON PUT ON WHAT'S THE GET OUT THERE AND FEEL THAT FEELING OF THAT WATER HIDDEN YET AND EITHER GOTTEN THROUGH THE WAVES AND BREAK INTO THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS ROLLING WITH IT AND GET COMFORTABLE WITH IT
h9PawU0t-ys_4 THE MORE TIME IT'S BEEN SWIMMING WETSUIT UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS YOU FEEL SAFE FOR IN A FEW MORE COMFORTABLE
h9PawU0t-ys_5 THE WET SUIT AND GIVE YOU A LOT MORE COMFORT THAT SITUATION BECAUSE OF THE ADDED BUOYANCY
h9PawU0t-ys_6 SO THE IN A WET SUIT IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THEN SWIMMING OUT WITHOUT ONE
h9PawU0t-ys_7 YOU'LL PROBABLY USE ONE TO TWO STROKES LAST FOR LENGTH YOU'LL GLIDE MORE ANNUAL RIGHT HIGHER IN WATER
h9PawU0t-ys_8 OF YOU CAN TAKE IT INTO THE POOL AND SWIM OF IT AND IT JUST TO GET INTO IT FEELS VERY DIFFERENT
h9PawU0t-ys_9 IT'S EFFICIENT AND THE POOR SWIMMER YOU ARE THE MORE THE VEIN TIME WITH A WET SUIT
h9PawU0t-ys_10 IF YOU HAVE REALLY GOOD BODY POSITION ALREADY THE WETSUIT WILL PICK UP A LOT ON THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL SEE A THREE TO FIVE SECOND FOR HUNDRED IMPROVEMENT
h9PawU0t-ys_11 AND THAT'S A REALLY NICE THING

h9PawU0t-ys_16 TO GET OUT AND THEN QUICKLY SETTLE DOWN INTO RHYTHM YOU DON'T WANT HIM TO SCAN EVEN THE THING YOU GET INTO A SLOW GROUP
h9PawU0t-ys_17 IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY GOOD RELATE TO SWING WITH A LOCAL CRAFT ONE CLUB OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT PRACTICE OPEN WATER SWIMMING IT'S A GREAT THING TO DO YOU CAN PRACTICE DRAFTING OFF SOMEBODY WHAT IT'S LIKE THIS ONE RIGHT CLOSE BEHIND AND ON AGAIN IT'S OF THEM IT'S JUST BEST EXPERIENCE BY BY DOING IT
h9PawU0t-ys_18 SOME OTHER THINGS YOU CAN PRACTICE IN POOL SLIDING AND IN AN OPEN WATER SWIM EVERY SIX RATES ROTATION NEED TO CHOP DISTORT STROKE SHORT AND STICK YOUR HEAD UP
h9PawU0t-ys_19 AND STAYING ON COURSES A WHOLE ANOTHER ASPECT OF ON OPEN WATER SWIMMING
h9PawU0t-ys_20 TO TRY TO PICK SOMETHING ON THE SHORELINE NOT THE BLUE THIS WOMAN FOR BUT A BOAT RAMP OR A HOME OR A LAMP HOLE OR SOMETHING SO THAT IF YOU'VE GOT A C OF BRIGHT ORANGE KEPT IN FRONT OF YOU THE STILL KNOW WHICH ARE SWIMMING FOR

G4RAZyip8ko_1 SO BECAUSE LETTERS ACACIA SYSTEMS ARE SO IMPORTANT THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT KINDS THAT YOU CAN USE

g524tYzDE0Y_1 HI I'M MATT CAIL AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A SCARECROW COSTUME
g524tYzDE0Y_2 THEN WE COME TO SOCKS
g524tYzDE0Y_3 NOW THERE ARE TWO LINES OF THINKING FOR SOCKS AND SCARECROW
g524tYzDE0Y_4 ONE OF THEM IS THAT SOCK SHOULD BEEF BRIGHTER COLORS
g524tYzDE0Y_5 RED AND WHITE STRIPES
g524tYzDE0Y_6 THAT SORT OF THING FOR SCARECROW
g524tYzDE0Y_7 IT CAN WIN AN ARIES WE CAN BE A LITTLE BRIGHTEN SHEER PHONE SCARECROW BODY
g524tYzDE0Y_8 I'VE NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD THAT
g524tYzDE0Y_9 AND I LIKE TO CUT A GOAL MORE TRADITIONAL
g524tYzDE0Y_10 I MEAN SCARECROWS OR OUTSIDE
g524tYzDE0Y_12 SO I ACTUALLY LIKE TO HAVE CUT A THICKER MORE COTTONY SOCKS
g524tYzDE0Y_13 GENERALLY IN MORE SUBDUED SHADES
g524tYzDE0Y_14 SUCH AS A HAVING IS IN BLACK AND RAISE OR ALSO BROWNS
g524tYzDE0Y_15 EVEN LIGHT GROUNDS AND PROBABLY WORK
g524tYzDE0Y_16 AND THIS IS ALSO GREAT BECAUSE THE THICKER COTTON SOCKS WILL ALSO ALLOW SECUNDA STUFF MORE THINGS ON INTO THE SCARECROW LATER ON WHICH WE'RE GOING TO GET TOO
g524tYzDE0Y_17 WE'RE IS A THIN SAY DRESS SALK WON'T YOU'RE NOT REALLY CAN BE OF THE STUFF SOMETHING IN THERE
g524tYzDE0Y_18 IT ALSO COULD GET LIKE IF SHE TRIED TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
g524tYzDE0Y_19 SO FOR SOCKS I DON'T RECOMMEND HAVING A GREAT IN BLACK UH SHADES TO HAVE THEIR
g524tYzDE0Y_20 AND THEN IN ADDITION OTHER THINGS YOU CAN THINK OF ONION WHAT HAVE YOU DID IT WITHIN ONE HAVE SOCKS
g524tYzDE0Y_21 SOME SCARECROWS DON'T HAVE FEET AT ALL
g524tYzDE0Y_22 BUT OF COURSE YOUR HUMAN YOU HAFFEY
g524tYzDE0Y_23 SETTINGS AND SOCKS
HiwtELMng_A_1 ADD THE ROPE MINT IS OF FAIRLY SIMPLE MANEUVER IN THEORY THAT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO PULL OFF
HiwtELMng_A_2 AND ALL AND IT IS I AM LEAVING YOUR OPPONENT'S ATTEMPT TO TAKE YOUR BLADE
HiwtELMng_A_3 SOME OF YOUR OPPONENT TRIES TO BIND OR TO BEACHER BLADE ANY SUCCESSFULLY OF WE CONTACT COMPLETELY WHILE MAINTAINING RIGHT OF WAY WHEN YOU PULL OFF A SUCCESSFUL AND UH
HiwtELMng_A_4 SO OF PART OF THE DIFFICULTY HAND PULLING OFF ONE NOT JUST OF EATING OF VERY QUICK MOVEMENT BY YOUR OPPONENT ON A BLADE BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT FOR TO FOR THE BIEDERMAN OF ALREADY ESTABLISHED RIGHT AWAY
HiwtELMng_A_5 SO MY HIS ARM IS STRAIGHT AND IT HAS TO REMAIN STRAIGHT FOR ME TO CONTINUE TO PULL UP THIS MANEUVER
HiwtELMng_A_6 SO MY OPPONENT HAS TO BE GLAD LAID IN I DISENGAGE BEFORE SHE MAKES CONTACT AND IN SUCCESSFUL AND OF COURSE SINCE I HAVE MAINTAIN THAT RIGHT AWAY AT AND WOULD HURT AND TAKE IT FOR ME I WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT IMMEDIATELY WITH THE THRUST
HiwtELMng_A_7 YOU CAN I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BE DISENGAGE A CAN OF MEAN A LOT OF WAYS
HiwtELMng_A_8 I MIGHT TRY A HOOP A OVER THE BLADE
HiwtELMng_A_9 I CAN ALSO DO SEVERAL IN A ROW AS LONG AS I MAINTAIN THAT RIGHT OF WAY
HiwtELMng_A_10 SO IF SHE'S TRYING TO FOR MANEUVERS AND I MANAGING TO ALLEVIATE HER EACH TIME OF COURSE IT'S MOVING IT FASTER THAN THAT AND THAT IS IN OF ICING OPENING IT FOR AS LONG AS I CAN AVOID HER BLADE HEAT LAMP STRAIGHT I CAN MOVE IN FOR THRUST
HiwtELMng_A_11 EYELETS OR HOW THAT WORKS WITH A LITTLE PLATE ONLY ACTION

gMoqAzB3ODY_3 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ON BUILDING AT TROUBLESHOOTING AND REPAIR YOUR OWN AUDIO CABLES MICROPHONE CABLES AND SO FORTH
gMoqAzB3ODY_4 THE FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS TAKE A LOOK OF THE TOOLS THAT YOU'LL NEED TO DO THIS WORK
gMoqAzB3ODY_5 YOU'LL NEED A SOLDERING IRON
gMoqAzB3ODY_6 NOW IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO LOTS AND LOTS OF YOUR OWN WORK YOU CAN GET ONE THAT DOES NOT HAVE THIS POWER BASE AND IT'S JUST A HANDLE LIKE THIS
gMoqAzB3ODY_7 YOU CAN HAVE THEM WITH A VARIABLE HE CONTROL MOM HERE OR WITHOUT WHICH ONE GIVE A DECENT QUALITY ONE THAT TO THE WILL DO THIS WORK
gMoqAzB3ODY_8 HAVING THEM VARIABLE TEMPERATURE CONTROL AND THIS WORKSTATION MAKES ONE A NICE PLACE TO PUT SHORE ON CENTER AND WHEN IT'S HOT INTO YOU CAN CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE VERY PRECISELY FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORK
gMoqAzB3ODY_9 FOR MAKING AUDIO CONNECTORS CONNECTIONS IT IS NOT MIRROR IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A VERY PRECISE CONTROL OVERHEAT AS AND IT WOULD BE IF YOU'RE WORKING ON CIRCUIT BOARDS WEAR OUT OVERHEATING OF COMPONENT CAN DAMAGE IT QUITE EASILY
gMoqAzB3ODY_10 LEAVE A MOISTEN SPONGE
gMoqAzB3ODY_11 THE MOST AND SPONGE WE USE TO CLEAN THE TIP OF OUR CETERA
gMoqAzB3ODY_12 ALL YOU NEED SOME WIRE CUTTERS YOU NEED RESIN CHORDS SOLDER AND SOME FORM OF WIRE STRIPPERS
gMoqAzB3ODY_13 THIS HAS A CRIMPER AND EVERYTHING OF OIL THAT THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD USES THE WIRE STRIPPER
gMoqAzB3ODY_14 AND THEN IT IS NICE TO HAVE SOME WAY TO REMOVE THE SOLDER OF FROM THE OLD JOINT
gMoqAzB3ODY_15 THIS IS A SET A TIGHT SEDU REMOVING PROCESS OR WE HAVE THIS BRAIDED TIGHT
gMoqAzB3ODY_16 ANOTHER TOOL THAT I BUILT MYSELF WOULD BE THIS CLAMP I WISH YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A CLAMP LIKE THIS AND IT'S VERY SIMPLE CLAMP

HINaX_z0mHU_1 HEY GUYS WHAT'S UP
HINaX_z0mHU_2 THIS IS JACOB FROM THE SKATE BARN SKATEBOARD PARK IN HAMPSTEAD NORTH CAROLINA
HINaX_z0mHU_3 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO DO A MANUAL ON A SKATEBOARD
HINaX_z0mHU_4 MAY KNOW ALSO CALLED A WHEELIE IS WHEN YOU BALANCE ON YOUR BACK TWO WHEELS ALONE PROVIDING EQUAL AMOUNT OF PRESSURE TO THE TAIL IN THE CENTER OF YOUR BOARD THEREFORE YOU DO NOT WANT A SCRAPER TAIL WORT MUCH DIFFERENT WILL SET
HINaX_z0mHU_5 MANUALS TAKE A LITTLE BY THE TIME BEING USED TO
HINaX_z0mHU_6 EVEN AFTER LEARNING WHERE TO PLACE YOUR FEET ON THE BOARD IN THAT HAVE TO LEARN THE PROPER SKI AND YOU NEED TO KNOW AND A NICE FLAT SNOOZE SERVICE A CHILD
HINaX_z0mHU_7 HERE WE GO
HINaX_z0mHU_8 ALL NOW DEMONSTRATE THE MENU
HINaX_z0mHU_9 THE ONE STEADY FLUSH IN THE PROPER FOOT PLACEMENT YOU SHOULD BE OVER THE MENU ALL ON UP
HINaX_z0mHU_10 ONCE YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH DOING A MANUAL THERE ARE SEVERAL VARIATIONS AND YOU CAN DO IT
HINaX_z0mHU_11 YOU CAN OLLIE ONTO A SIDEWALK AND MANUAL ON HOW YOU CAN DO A ONE EIGHTY INTO A MANUAL A KICK FLIP TO A MANUAL WORE START REALLY BASIC AND LEARN HOW TO DO A NOSE RING
HINaX_z0mHU_12 ON NOW THEN STRAIGHTEN AS AN A
HINaX_z0mHU_13 ONCE AGAIN WE'RE IN A BALANCE THE WEIGHT ON THE NOSE THIS TIME JUST ENOUGH NOT TO STRAIGHTEN THOSE OR TO LET THE BACK WHEELS TOUCH THE GROUND
HINaX_z0mHU_14 HERE'S A NOSE RING ALL HAVE HOE
HINaX_z0mHU_15 A HALF OF A IF THAT'S HOW YOU DO A MANUAL IN SKATEBOARD
GAP9uRYfTLk_1 NEXT KNOT ORGAN IT'S I'VE IS THE L LARKS
GAP9uRYfTLk_2 ADD ON MANY OF US MINE OF THIS NOT AS WELL
GAP9uRYfTLk_3 IT HAS TO BE A FAIRLY NATURAL NOT THAT I'VE OR JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE SOMETHING OR
GAP9uRYfTLk_4 TO START BY FOLDING THE RIBBON IN HALF AND YOU CAN TAKE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO TIGHT AROUND
GAP9uRYfTLk_5 IT'S OFTEN TIED AROUND A HOOK OR MOVE AND THEN YOU TAKE THE TWO ENDS OFF TO THE ENDS OF THE ROPE SLIDE THEM THROUGH THE LOOP AND GO EXCESS
GAP9uRYfTLk_6 I LIKE TO NOT ON IS AN OIL IS THE MOST TABLE NOT ON BUT THE WAY YOU CAN MAKE IT MORE STABLE IS SIMPLY BY PASSING ONE AND OTHER OF THROUGH AGAIN AND THIS CAN IT MAKES IT FIND UP A LITTLE THAT RICH BALLS OF THE MORE DIFFICULT ON TIE THAT THE LONGER THING
GfQLBy4gfTM_1 NOW TO GET OF THIS FLOOR FUNGAL BACK GOOD CLEAN UP ON THE INSIDE PUSH AND NOW WHOA WHOA
GfQLBy4gfTM_2 MY FINGER LOOK FOR A MOMENT ONION
GfQLBy4gfTM_3 AND PHONE PUT IN A
GfQLBy4gfTM_4 IT
GfQLBy4gfTM_5 WITH
GfQLBy4gfTM_6 <UNK> AT ONE GO OFF AT A CHAIR FIFTH
GfQLBy4gfTM_7 AND THIS BALL IT DOESN'T TAKE THAT POTTER'S KNIFE IN OF MAKE IT REALLY IS A DRY DOWN A SCRIPT AWFUL THE MOVE WITH OF ON THE <UNK> CLAY
GfQLBy4gfTM_8 IT IS DRY AND THEN IT HAS A DRIER THIS CLAY HAS BEEN A BETTER OFF OF HIM AND BEEF WHEN IT COMES TO THIS NEXT AN INFORMATIVE WHERE <UNK> TO MAKE A RED OF AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS AND MAKES THE THE FIRING PROCESS NETWORK AND AND ALL THE COMPRESSION IT IN THE SKIN AND MAKE SURE THAT WE GET TO THE FIVE PRESS A CAT
gVFBabbrWxM_1 ONE OF THE TRICKS THAT STILL HAVE TO LEARN BEFORE DOING THE FAKIE OLLIE DISASTER IS YOU'LL NEED TO KNOW HOW IT FEELS THAT HAVE YOUR BACK WHEELS ABOVE THE TRANSITION AND ABLE TO GET OUT FROM THIS POSITION
gVFBabbrWxM_2 IT'S EASY TO GET INTO THIS POSITION BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS BY ROLLING BACKWARDS WITH TOO MUCH SPEED AND YOU END UP LOCKING OVER
gVFBabbrWxM_3 FULL WHICH YOU WANNA MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IS BE ABLE TO PUT WEIGHT ON YOUR FRONT OF YOUR BOARD OR YOUR NOSE AND ACTUALLY IT BE ABLE TO MOVE PURPOSEFULLY PICK UP THE BACK WHEELS AND CLEAR THE COPING AND BE A BLACK AND ROLL BACK DOWN THE TRANSITION AND HAVE CONTROL
gVFBabbrWxM_4 SOAP WHICH AGAIN A LOT TO DO IS ROLL BACKWARDS UP THE QUARTER PIPE OR MANY WRAP THAT YOU'RE SKATING AND LET YOUR BACK WHEELS ROLL ON THOUGHT
gVFBabbrWxM_5 AND THEN WHEN YOU ARE LOCKED IN THIS POSITION IT'S BEST TO LOCK BECAUSE THAT WAY YOU DON'T THROUGH KNOTS HEARING THE LOCK WITH YOUR WHEELS AGAINST THE COPING
gVFBabbrWxM_6 AND THEN PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR NOSE AND LET THE BACK WHEELS PICKUP PASS THE COPING AND CLEAR IT COMPLETELY AND THEN ROLL DOWN THE TRANSITION
gVFBabbrWxM_7 THE SECOND LEARNING THIS MOTION WILL GET TO SET UP SO THAT WHEN YOU DO A BIG ALL THE OR CRACK THE FAKIE DISASTER AND LANDS YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'LL NEED TO DO WHEN YOU ROLL BACK IN AND IT'S JUST ONE OF THE TRICKS YOU NEED TO LEARN FOR DOING FAKIE OLLIE DISASTER
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_1 HI I'M LUCY SPAIN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE HERE TO TALK ABOUT CHEERLEADING JUMPS AND TUMBLING
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_2 ONE OF THEM AS THEY THINK TUMBLES WE CAN START WITH IS A CARTWHEEL
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_3 NOW A CAR WITH ANY REALLY IMPORTANT YOU THAT THE BAY FUNDAMENTAL TO BUILD LINE IN THE AIR CONFIDENCE THAT FOR DOING ANY SORT OF TUMBLE AT ALL
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_4 IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOU KEEP YOUR ARMS AT A LOCK POSITION IT OFF COMES IN ON THE GROUND
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_5 ANOTHER VARIATION OF THE CARD WILL IS AROUND OUR
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_6 AND THE ROUND OFF IS RIDGE THEM INTO THE CAR OF IF EVER WE HAVE A TORSO TURN AND INSTEAD OF OUR LENGTHENING THE FLOOR ONE BY WINE OUR LEGS WILL HIT THE FLOOR TOGETHER
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_7 NOW WHEN SIGN AND HOT OF THE BEST WAY TO LEARN IS BY TAKING ONLINE OF MASKING TAPE ACROSS THE FLOOR THE INDIES
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_8 ONCE YOU HAVE THAT MASKING TAPE THAT YOU CAN PUT YOUR TOE ON THE LINES STAR
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_9 NOW THE FIRST THING THAT CAN HIT THE FLOOR IS IN THE OF FIRSTHAND
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_10 HALF A RIGHT HANDED THAT TO THE RIGHT HAND
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_11 IF A LEFT IN ADHESIVELY TO THE OTHER END OF THE LINE YOU TO GO THREE LEFT HAND
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_12 IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW TO DO BOTH EYES AND HE MAY BE ASKED TO COME FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_13 SO ONCE LEAVES THAT ARE SOUTH OR IN A RAISE OUR RIGHT HAND OR LEFT HIM WHICH EVER IS IN YOUR FIRST HIT THE FLOOR IT IN A MIXER IT LANDS ON THE TAPE LINE IN TO A TEN FOOT FOOT
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_14 AND THAT'S BASICALLY WAVE IN ONE AND YOU FOR THE CAR
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_15 AND ONCE AGAIN A BASIC MASTERED IT IN WITH HEATED UP A LITTLE BIT THEY CAN GET THE MOMENTUM BUILDING
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_16 NOW THE ROUND OFF OF A SIMILAR TO THE CURRENT <UNK>
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_17 IT DOES THING IS TIGHT WITH THE SAME CUT RACES THEM USED A MIDDLE ONE
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_18 THE ONLY THING IS ONCE OR IN THE AIR WE HAVE BOTH FEET AT THIRTY TO WHAT IT MEANS TOGETHER INTO THIN DROPPING AT A FEATHER TYPE THING WHEN THE RAT
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_19 NOW THE ROUND OFF IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT HUMBLE INTO ANY IS THIS IS HOWARD IN A STAR ALL OF OUR RUNNING TUMBLING PASS IS IS
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_20 NOW TO REALLY WERE AND PRACTICE AROUND OFF WITH SPEED AND POWER AND HIGH
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_21 THEY USUALLY WHEN YOU GET AS MUCH OF A RUNNING START AS POSSIBLE
GqfVQ5Mdy_c_22 YOU REALLY WOULDN'T AS FAST AS YOU CAN INTO THAT THUMB BOTH GET A LOT OF HER GOING IN REALLY THIN PRIVATE AND FROM HERE AT THE END OF OUR ROUND OFF IS WRITTEN INTO ALL OF OUR BACK FLIPS BACK HANDSPRINGS IN FULL
HHwBA2f1lGs_1 IT'S IMPORTANT JUST LIKE IT WAS WITH THE PAPIER-MACHE TO LET OUR THOSE ARE DRY
HHwBA2f1lGs_2 BUT THE PAINT DRY IN THE GLUE DRY
HHwBA2f1lGs_3 SINCE WE USED A COUPLE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAINT
HHwBA2f1lGs_4 WE HAVE THE ACRYLIC WHICH DRIES PRETTY QUICKLY ON AND THEN THE TEMPERA GLITTER WHICH TAKES A LITTLE BIT LONGER SO I THINK ON IT'S BEST TO LEAVE IT IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA PROBABLY THE THING PLACE A LEFT IT TO DO ON THE PAPIER-MACHE DRYING PROCESS
HHwBA2f1lGs_5 YOU ALSO ONE AND MAKE SURE THAT HE IS ON A SURFACE THAT CAN BE PULLED UP EASILY
HHwBA2f1lGs_6 IF YOU PUT A MIME NEWSPAPER DRIVE WITH THIS KIND OF PAINT WITH THE ACRYLIC PAINT IF WHEN YOU LIFT AND NOT HIT THAT HAVE PIECES OF THAT NEWSPAPERS STOCK SIT HIM ON AND IT'S IN IT ONLY IN AND CREATE MORE OF A PROCESS FOR GOING BACK AND CLEANING OFF ON THE PAINTING A PAINTING OVER
HHwBA2f1lGs_7 IF YOU NEED TO DO A COUPLE COATS OF PAINT ON YOUR LIZARD ON YOU CAN DO THAT LET IT DRY AND COME BACK IN AND PAINTED OVER AGAIN
HHwBA2f1lGs_8 YOU ALSO IN A MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU'VE APPLIED A FACE ON YOUR LIZARD THAT THE GLUE IS DRY ON BEFORE HANGING HAMMER OR DISPLAYING HIM ON THOSE AND SEQUINS IN THE IN THE GOOGLEY EYES CAN TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO DRY
gODs-0lceYM_1 WITH A THE RUM CONSCIOUS COCKING MEDIUM WRONG PUNCH
gODs-0lceYM_2 WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GIVE YOU THE BIG INGREDIENTS TO MAKE A BIG PUNCH THAT I MAKE IT IN A COCKTAIL GLASS YOU CAN VIEW THAT LOOKS LIKE
gODs-0lceYM_3 NORMALLY WOULD WE WANT TO OIL ANYONE ADDED LIKE TWO PART SUGAR
gODs-0lceYM_4 AND WITH STEER THE SUGAR AND TILTS DISSOLVES
gODs-0lceYM_5 IN REMOVE FROM HEAT AND THEN YOU WOULD ADD THREE PARTS ROBERT IN ONE PART LIMIT LEMON JUICE AND THEN PUT OVER AT EASE
gODs-0lceYM_6 OKAY NOW IT'S MAKING
gODs-0lceYM_7 SINCE ORGAN INTO THREE OUNCES OF RUM WE'VE ALWAYS MAKE PUNCHES AS A COSIA ONE ARE A
gODs-0lceYM_9 THREE OUNCES OF LIGHT RUM
gODs-0lceYM_10 AN ORGAN ADD AN OUNCE OF A LEMON JUICE RING ON IN THE HAIR
gODs-0lceYM_11 NEVER DO TWO PART SUGAR
gODs-0lceYM_12 AND I HAVE WHICH IS THE LENGTH AREA
gODs-0lceYM_13 THAT'S PROBABLY NOT
gODs-0lceYM_14 AND NOW ORGAN AND JUST ADD SOME WATER
gODs-0lceYM_15 LITTLE LOOSE AND WATER
gODs-0lceYM_16 HAVE ONE OR USE THAT ONE
gODs-0lceYM_17 IF THERE IS HOW I
gODs-0lceYM_18 ADD SOME WATER JUST LIKE SO
gODs-0lceYM_19 NOW MIX THAT REALLY TOUCH SO THAT THE CERTAIN DOES IS NOT AS WE'RE NOT BOILING IT RIGHT
gODs-0lceYM_20 THAT A COCKTAIL GLASS IN IS OF LATER CANADIAN OF <UNK> IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE
gODs-0lceYM_21 NATHAN COLOR
gODs-0lceYM_22 THERE WE GO
gODs-0lceYM_23 A GOOD TO GO
G_yLd9y2nLk_1 OKAY THE FIRST MOVE AND TALK ABOUT THE TOP OF THE KEY OF THE NEUTRAL STANCE
G_yLd9y2nLk_2 AND THIS IS A TYPE OF ALL THE BALL IN FRONT OF YOU HEAR THE CHANCE TO STEP INTO IT AND ATTACK THE FLAIL
G_yLd9y2nLk_3 SO THIS IS OF MORE FLAT FOR TYPE MOTION
G_yLd9y2nLk_4 BASE OF THIS AGAIN FOR ALL LEVELS ALL AGES
G_yLd9y2nLk_5 WOULD HAS GOT WITH YOU TO DO IS IT CAN STILL THORTON THE QUARTERS AND BASICALLY HITS OF PHUT CROSS COURT THAT SKIPPING TOWARD THAT DIRECTION WITH HIS LEFT FOOT
G_yLd9y2nLk_6 IT IS BODIES WRONG THAT DIRECTION AS WELL
G_yLd9y2nLk_7 SO WHAT'S LEFT FOOT AS IT COMES AROUND THE SCHOOL AND STEPPING IN THE CHORD

hAUeqalPhWI_1 I'M TIM GIBSON INNOMINATE SHOW YOU HOW TO MEASURE YOUR WINDOW FOR CURTAINS
hAUeqalPhWI_2 NOW WHEN YOU MENTION FOR CURTAINS IT SOME OF IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF CURTAIN ENTERED IN A PUT ENOUGH
hAUeqalPhWI_3 LUNG POINT OUT OF THE THE TORSO CHEERS
hAUeqalPhWI_4 SO IF YOU LOOK DOWN HERE THE BOTTOM YOU CAN SEE THEY COOL LITTLE BIT AT THE FLOOR
hAUeqalPhWI_5 SO YOU WANT TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AT SOME UNIFY COMMON WITH SOAP SHEARS IS THAT YOU WANT THEM TO POOL AND A FLOOR LIKE THIS
hAUeqalPhWI_6 NOW THE REGULAR CURTAINS WILL STOP IT SHORT OF THE FLOOR
hAUeqalPhWI_7 LET THEM YOU WANT AND THAT ARE NOW YET AND WHEN YOU THINK OF THE LENGTH OF YOUR CURTAINS IN IN HOW THEY'RE GO ON LOW THEM
hAUeqalPhWI_8 NOW IN THIS PARTICULAR HOME THE SEVEN NINE FOOT CEILINGS IN THIS HOME SO IT'S NOT QUITE AS IS THE CRITICAL WHERE YOU HANG YOUR OVERALL WORMS
hAUeqalPhWI_9 BUT IF YOU HAVE SHORTER US CEILINGS HESITATE PUT SAILING ONE THING THAT YOU CAN DO CURTAINS CAN HELP YOU ACTUALLY MAKE THE ROOM LOOK TALLER
hAUeqalPhWI_10 SO WHERE WE HAVE THE EASE IT WITH CURTAINS HOME GET A COUPLE INCHES ABOUT THREE INCHES OVER THE WINDOW UP IF YOU WANT MY RULE OF TALLER FLEA ACTUALLY COME UP THROUGH THE POINT THAT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE CROWN IN THE TOP OF THE WINDOW
hAUeqalPhWI_11 AND ANY OTHER THING YOU WANT TO CONSIDER IS HOW WIDE YOU WANT YOUR CURTAIN RAW
hAUeqalPhWI_12 NOW IF YOU WANT YOUR WINDOWS TO BE OPEN IF YOU'RE HANGING SOLID CURTAINS HERE YOU WANT TO WINDOWS TO BE OPEN WHEN YOU WALK WITH CURRENT ROD MAYBE BE EIGHT INCHES OR SO WIDER THAN THE ACTUAL WINDOW OPENING
hAUeqalPhWI_13 SO LITTLE THINGS IN MIND WILL JUST LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR LOOKING AT A SHE <UNK> SO WE WOULD MEASURE THE LENGTH OF THE <UNK> SO KNOWING THE LENGTH OF OUR SHEERS ORGAN DUE TO SIMPLY MEASURE UP AND WE WANT THE CURTAIN RODS SITTING ABOUT A HALF AN INCH LOWER THIN WHAT THE ACTUAL LIKE IT
hAUeqalPhWI_14 SO IN THIS FACED FIFTH WHEN I MEASURED OUT NOW WE'VE GOT ABOUT A YEAR EIGHTY FOUR INCHES SO THE ACTUAL CURTAIN LENGTH WOULD BE ABOUT EIGHTY FOR HALF OF THE EXTRA HALF AN INCH IS DON'T ALLOW A POOL
hAUeqalPhWI_15 IN A MEASURE THE WIDTH OF THE CURRENT LIFE IN A SPACE AND THIS IS YOUR WANTED A LITTLE BIT WIDER SO WILL MEASURE OUR OPENING IN YOU AND GO INSIDE MENTIONED INSIDE EMISSION WE GOT THIRTY FIVE
hAUeqalPhWI_16 SO IN THIS CASE WE WANT OUR BRACKETS AND IN OUR ROD BE JUST A FEW INCHES LONGER THAN AN OPEN
hAUeqalPhWI_17 I'M TIM GIBSON AND THAT IS HOW TO MEASURE FOR CURTAINS
GDUxtkCe5uA_1 I'M A

GDUxtkCe5uA_10 SOMETIMES IT'S A LITTLE LONGER INTO AN EIGHT PLATES
GDUxtkCe5uA_11 BUT I WANT YOU TO GET YOU NOW IS HOW TO DO AND NOT TIGHT
GDUxtkCe5uA_12 AS A AGAIN LIGAMENTS AS A GOING ACT AS WELL IT HAS A SINGLE WHITE LINE ON IT
GDUxtkCe5uA_13 WHEN IT'S AT WATER OUT OF THE TANK AND THAT INTO THE TUBE DOES LIKE WE DID ON THE MINUTE
GDUxtkCe5uA_14 IT'S OUT WE FILL IN AUTO TO THE WHITE LINE WITH THE WATER
GDUxtkCe5uA_15 A SET THIS DOWN WILL GET THE NITRITE TEST BOX WHICH IS PINK
GDUxtkCe5uA_16 ON IT IT HAS ADD SIDE DROPS
GDUxtkCe5uA_17 WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL REMOVE THE CAT OUT THE BOTTLE AND FAT DROPS THAT THE TOP BACK ON AND SHAKE ABOUT TWO OR THE COW <UNK>
GDUxtkCe5uA_18 IT SAYS SAUCER TAKES FIVE MINUTES BUT RIGHT NOW SHOW A NICE PRETTY BLUE COLOR
GDUxtkCe5uA_19 AND THIS GUY'S TO A NICE PRETTY BLUE COLOR GENERAL COLLEGE DELAY HAVE HIGH NOTCH ICE IN THE TANK WHICH IS ACID METHOD OF FISH AS WELL AS THE AMMONIA VOC SENSE
GDUxtkCe5uA_20 NA TRI LITTLE SANAA CITY CAUTION TOO MUCH FISH MOVE INTO THE FISH IN THE TANK AS WELL AS AMONG A
GDUxtkCe5uA_21 AND WE HAVE AMMONIA AND MY TIGHTENING TANG WON'T THE SAME TIME ANY NEEDED ISN'T MAJOR SEN YOUNG TANK TO TAKE A WHILE AND FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS
GDUxtkCe5uA_22 AS THE THE THE DOUGH OF WANTONLY EVENLY YOUR WHOLE TANK

H2q3JOMMNCQ_1 HI I'M JEN FROM CLAY CAFE AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'LL BE SHOWING A THICKER THERAPY THROUGH START AND
H2q3JOMMNCQ_2 WHAT THAT IS IS WHEN HE DID IN THE DESIGN COMPLETE THE NEXT PIECE WITH GO INTO THE CROSSES STAGE
H2q3JOMMNCQ_3 TO START ON SIX IN STAGE WE ENTER INTO THE CLEAR GLAZING
H2q3JOMMNCQ_4 SO THIS LOOK VERY CLEAR AND ART AND THE PRIVILEGED HIM TO IT AND THE REASON ON THAT THE DONE IS THE MEANING MARKERS RC ON LIKE A FOOD COLORING MINERAL INTO THE GLAZE AND ONCES OF VISUAL GUIDE TOO BIG LASERS WHO NEED TO COVER AN ENTIRE PIECE IN SIRI EVERYTHING IS NICE AND FIELD WATERTIGHT AND OF COURSE FOOD SAFE
H2q3JOMMNCQ_5 SO TO START THE GLAZING PROCESS WILL MIND YOU IS MAKE SURE THAT OUR GLAZES VERY WELL MIX AND HAVE THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY
H2q3JOMMNCQ_6 A GREAT ON PRODUCT AND WHAT IS A LITTLE STRANGE BUT WORKS A REALLY REALLY GREAT FOR MIXING A GLAZE IS A TOILET LAUGHS BELIEVE IT OR NOT
H2q3JOMMNCQ_7 DON'T ARCH IS A REALLY REALLY GREAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE ALL THESE BERTHOLD AND IT'LL SCOOP OUT ANY ON OF THE SLIDES THAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN A GLAZE SETS
H2q3JOMMNCQ_8 SO YOU TWENTY GIVEN A REALLY NICE GOOD STIR

H2q3JOMMNCQ_10 AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S REALLY NICELY MIX OF ANY REGISTER GLAZE AND
H2q3JOMMNCQ_11 SOME PEOPLE ON WHO WILL DIP HIT V ON PIECES INTO A CLEAR GLAZE AND OTHER SEASON PAINTED ON ON
H2q3JOMMNCQ_12 I REALLY LIKE THE NONABRASIVE NICE AND BIG THING BECAUSE REALLY ARE NOT TOUCHING THE PIECES A WHOLE LOT AND WHEN YOU RPG ARE CLEAR GLAZE ON WHAT CAN HAPPEN IS YOU AS SOON AS THE PIECE GETS WET YOU RE ACTIVATE THE PAINT ON AND ONE OF HEAT REACTIVATED IT'S VERY EASY FOR YOU TO START MOVING IT WHEN YOU ARE BRUSHING IT ON
H2q3JOMMNCQ_13 SO TO START TO DIP YOUR PIECE WHICH IS WHAT I PREFER IS YOU JUST GONNA TAKE UNDERNEATH SIMPLE TILE HERE AND ACTUALLY GOOD IT ONE HALF FIRST AND THEN DO THE OTHER HALF

H2q3JOMMNCQ_17 SO ON AND DO IT WHEN YOU TAKE A PIECE AND DIFFERENT LIGHTLY OIL IN GIVE IT A REALLY GOOD SHAKE
H2q3JOMMNCQ_18 SO IT WILL LIKE TO BLOW ON A PIECE TO GET THE ACCESS PAINT OFF BUT I FIND SOMETIMES THAT CREATES THAN DIRT MARKS SO I TEND TO THIS SHEET PIECE OFF
H2q3JOMMNCQ_19 AND THEN IT'S COVERED AND PURPLE GUIDES LAY IT DOWN ON THIS DRAWING GRADE ON ANY CONSISTENT THERE TO DRY AND TILT READY FOR THE NEXT STEP
H2q3JOMMNCQ_20 ALL THE EXCESS GLAZE NICELY DRIPS OFF ON TO THE SNAP AND WE JUST MAKE SURE THAT WE CLEAN IT PERIODICALLY SO THAT THE GLAZE DOESN'T BUILDUP ANSWER TO AFFECT THE BOTTOM OF THE PIECES
H2q3JOMMNCQ_21 NEXT WE'LL SURGICALLY OR GLAZE A BOWL
H2q3JOMMNCQ_22 PULL OR LOOK AT DIFFERENT ON AND IT ENDS USERS SEE THAT THE HALF AND HALF THAT
H2q3JOMMNCQ_23 SO ON AND DO THEM IN TAKE HE'S AN ONION DUNK IT AGAIN A LITTLE BIT OF SWEET TAKE IT OUT AND IT OF COURSE GIVE IT ANOTHER SHAKE

GGddM69-f1c_3 THEN I THINK LENGTH ARE PROBABLY THE MOST PLAYER AND BEING TO BE CAREFUL WITH WIND LYING ON
GGddM69-f1c_4 THERE'S TWO HOUSE ENDS VERGE LANYARD OUTINGS LIVE
GGddM69-f1c_5 THE HOUSE AND I THINK IT'S YOUTH WITH PAINT ON
GGddM69-f1c_6 THIS MAY TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER BUT THIS IS THE AND ME HERE HAS LITTLE EIGHTH IF THEY CAN AND MARK THEM ON
GGddM69-f1c_7 SO ONCE YOU HAVE TAKEN THE TIMES THAT BREATH A OF THE GREAT DETERGENT AND OF RATES AMATEUR WATER FRIED ANKLE'S ONCE THEY'RE HOT AND WASH AND ONCE THE WASHER A TIME HE COULD GO AHEAD AND JUST HIT INTO ROUGHING OUT IN HANDYMAN
GGddM69-f1c_8 THIS <UNK> OVERNIGHT HIS RIGHT HAND AND HAVING THEM FROM GETTING MATERIAL IS BUT THIS LEUMI PAINTING A CLOSE LOOK ON GREAT FOR A LONG TIME AND HOW IS SMALL FEET AS MUCH FROM DRYING IN AND IN A THIRD HIGH HERZFELD HEAT IT REALLY DIDN'T HER RIGHT HAND WASH THIRTY INCHES HERE AND HERE ARE HUMAN IT AWAY AND THIS IS FOR BOTH MY HANDS ARE ON TO IT HAS
GGddM69-f1c_9 AND WHEN EVER NOTHING WOULD EVER THOUGHT THAT YOU'VE YO YOU DON'T WANT IT IN IT AS IT IS THE HEIGHT OF WASH AND HE CAN GO AHEAD AND HANG THEM UP AND LET IT AIR DRY
GGddM69-f1c_10 NOW THE OTHER OPTION CHEATING HALF OF WRITING YOUR DOWN IT'S HE DON'T ONE WEEK ON YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO LET IT AIR DRY IT IS LEFT ERR ON YOUR ANIMAL FLYERS CYCLE
GGddM69-f1c_11 NOW I HAVE SOME VIRUS LIST EIGHT OUTFIT ON A DRIER THOUSAND I'LL BE AN ATHLETIC AVAILABLE TO YOU
GGddM69-f1c_12 BUT ON THIS ONE HALF LEFT AIR
GGddM69-f1c_13 THIS WILL THIS WILL PREVENT FROM HUNTING HIGH HEAT OR TOO MUCH HEAT UP LINES HERE FAIRLY CLOSE
GGddM69-f1c_14 IT MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN A NORMAL DRY EARTH ANGLE BUT THIS IS AN FASTER THAN EARS ARE AND IT ALSO HAS PROTECTION DOWN IT'S RUNNING
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_1 I AM REINDEL HAMMER AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY INITIATING AT RESTRINGING TUNE A GUITAR
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_2 NOW WE'VE BOIL OUR STRINGS ANNA AND ONE AND SIT AND COOL FOR A FEW MINUTES
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_3 AFTER THAT RATED FOR STRINGS ON
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_4 THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS REMEMBER HAVING TO OUR BRIDGE OFF WE'RE CLEANING THIS ARE OVER PUT THE BRIDGE BACK ON
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_6 AT FIRST STRING ONE FOOT ON IS THE THICKER STRING THAT ARE LOW E STRING
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_7 IT WILL MAKE SURE I'VE MADE A MISTAKE AND PUT THE WRONG STRING ON THE ON THE WRONG IN WRONG SPOT AND THAT'S NOT GOOD SO INJURY GOTHIC A STRING
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_8 A LOT OF STRINGS ARE COLOR CODED THESE HAPPENS AND NOT BE
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_9 RAMP AND THE FIRST STRING ON RIP AND THE BALL AND THE STRING AND PUT THAT RIGHT HERE IN THE SLOT ON THE TAIL PIECE
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_10 YOU MAKE SURE IT'S IN THERE NICE AND SNUG
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_11 NOW IT'S GONNA COME NOW AND GO RIGHT OVER TOP OF THE SADDLE SEALERS A LITTLE GROOVE IN THE SADDLE
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_12 SINCE IT'S IN THERE
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_13 AND TO DO THE OTHER END YOU'RE ALMOST ENOUGH FOR THE KIDS ARE DOWN OF RIGHT
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_14 HAVE A LOT THEN DOWN THERE NOW IS LITTLE HILLS IN THESE TUNING PECS I LIKE TO HAVE THE HOLES FACING NINETY DEGREES TO THE NECK SABRINA INSERT THE STRAIN THIS WAY
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_15 YOU WANNA GET YOURSELF A LITTLE SLACK TOO
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_16 AND PUT THE STRING IN LIKE THAT CAME AND PULL IT IN THIS WAY
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_17 THAT WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE HASSLE SLACK IN THE STRING SO THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH STRINGS WRAP AROUND
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_18 SO NOW WE HAVE THAT END AND WRAP THIS BACK AROUND HIM AND PULL IT NICE AND TIGHT UNDERNEATH AND PULL THAT TIGHT DOES LIKE THAT
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_19 NOW AND WOULD UP SEE OUT UNDERNEATH THE STRING WE BROUGHT AND THEN I WILL START TIGHTENING
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_20 IN AND TIGHTEN IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_21 AND MOVE THE STRING MAKE SURE IT'S IN THE RIGHT SLOT IN THE NUT WOMAN IN THE THIRD SLOT
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_22 LET'S TRY A REALLY KEY COOLING THIS TIGHT AS WE'RE WINDING
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_23 AND LINED UP TRACK IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT IS HAS TO BE TIGHT ENOUGH THAT EVERYTHING SECURE
Gqhjx3gKlyQ_24 NOW WE HAVE REFER STRING ON
hIc9x5jQhUE_1 AS WE AGE WE LOSE FLEXIBILITY
hIc9x5jQhUE_2 SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE FLEXIBILITY EXERCISE AND YOUR ROUTINE ON A DAILY BASIS
hIc9x5jQhUE_3 EVER NOTICE HOW CHILDREN ARE VERY VERY FLEXIBLE
hIc9x5jQhUE_4 AND THEN AS YOU A JUST ACTIVE LOSE THAT ABILITY TO REACH ALL THE WAY DOWN TO YOUR TOES LIKE IT COULD WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG
hIc9x5jQhUE_5 IT'S IMPORTANT TO INCREASE FLEXIBILITY FOR MANY REASONS
hIc9x5jQhUE_6 IT HELPS FOR NUTRITION TO THE JOINT AND IT HELPS PREVENT RISK OF INJURY DURING ACTIVITIES
hIc9x5jQhUE_7 TO INCREASE FLEXIBILITY IT'S IMPORTANT TO STRETCH EVERYDAY MAJOR MUSCLE GROUPS THAT YOU'VE STRENGTH AND
hIc9x5jQhUE_8 WHEN SHOULD YOU STRAPS
hIc9x5jQhUE_9 YOU SHOULD DIFFLEY STRETCH AFTER WORKOUT
hIc9x5jQhUE_10 STRETCHING BEFORE IS OK I'M BUT IT'S REALLY NOT CAN HELP YOU TO REALLY INCREASE THE FLEXIBILITY AND GAIN THE FLEXIBILITY THAT ARE LOOKING FOR
hIc9x5jQhUE_11 IT'S A STRETCHER MAJOR MUSCLE GROUPS ACROSS THE CHEST THE SHOULDERS THE TRICEPS THE UPPER BACK THE LOWER BACK THE QUADS THE HAMSTRINGS THE GLUTES AND OF COURSE THE CALF MUSCLES
hIc9x5jQhUE_12 HOLDING YOUR STRETCHES FOR ABOUT TEN TO THIRTY SECONDS WILL BRING OPTIMAL FLEXIBILITY
hIc9x5jQhUE_13 IF YOU CAN HOLD HIM A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAT'S GREAT
hIc9x5jQhUE_14 GOING THROUGH RANGE OF MOTION AND THEN HOLDING THE STRAPS WILL ALSO HELP
hIc9x5jQhUE_15 THERE'S LOTS OF SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT ABOUT THEIR ABOUT FLEXIBILITY BUT THERE IS ONE TRUE FIVE AND THAT IS TO MAKE SURE WHEN TO WORK OUT BUT YOU DO YOUR FLEXIBILITY EXERCISES
hIc9x5jQhUE_16 THIS IS ALICE MONTHS ART ENCOURAGING YOU TO GET ACTIVE AND INCLUDE FLEXIBILITY EVERY SINGLE DAY
H5i6iFqGC8E_1 HI MY NAME IS CHRIS FROM AQUATIC CENTRAL HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND ON THE WEB AT AQUATIC HYPHEN CENTRAL DOT COM
H5i6iFqGC8E_2 AND I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU HOW IN THAT PARTICULAR FRIDGE
H5i6iFqGC8E_3 AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE ARE MANY WAYS OF NOT DOING A FISH
H5i6iFqGC8E_4 DON'T FEET IF YOUR DOG I DON'T TAKE IT OUT OF THE WATER
H5i6iFqGC8E_5 DON'T LET IT BE MY OTHER FISH
H5i6iFqGC8E_6 ON WELL MORE PRACTICAL METHODS OF NOT GETTING IT FITS ARE SIMPLY KEEPING A WATER FLOWING
H5i6iFqGC8E_7 WING FREE CAN WATER CHANGES SERVICING YOUR FILTER CHECKING OR WATER FRAMERS' MAKE SURE THAT THE ORDER
H5i6iFqGC8E_8 REGULAR INSPECTION THAT IF IT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE HEALTHY REGULAR FEEDING
H5i6iFqGC8E_9 AND AGAIN THE MOST IMPORTANT AND CRUCIAL FACTORS YOU CAN CLEAN WATER
H5i6iFqGC8E_10 SOME FISH OFF FOR EXAMPLE THESE PLOW MOTIVES CAN MOVE OFF HOLD EASILY OVER FIFTY YEARS
H5i6iFqGC8E_11 THESE FITS IN HERE OR POSSIBLY SEVEN EIGHT INCHES AND PROBABLY ABOUT TEN TO FIFTEEN OWN NOODLE THAT MOMENT
H5i6iFqGC8E_12 AGAIN THIS IS OUT AND THAT'S ACTUALLY OF THIS
H5i6iFqGC8E_13 MY NAME IS CHRIS FROM AQUATIC CENTRAL HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND ON THE WEB AT AQUATIC HYPHEN CENTRAL DOT COM
hb3_mYgx7co_1 OKAY BEFORE WE START FROSTING ON THEIR WE WANT TO GET RID OF ANY CRUMBS THAT AROUND ONE THOSE SERVING TRAY AND AROUND THE CAKE
hb3_mYgx7co_2 <UNK> REALLY JUST A CUFF AND IF NAFF IF A FLUSH HEAD OFF
hb3_mYgx7co_3 YOU WANNA MAKE SURE YOU GET FEES FROM THE OFF SO THAT THEY DON'T GET MIXED IN TO THE FROSTING WHILE YOU'RE DEFINITELY AN
hb3_mYgx7co_4 FOR THAT YOU CAN JUST FRESH IT OFF WITH A HALF AND THEN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR WORK SURFACE HERE'S THE OLD CLEARS OF FRAMES
hb3_mYgx7co_5 WE'LL BEGIN OUR FROSTING WITH THIS SIDE OF THE CAKE AND THE KEY HERE IS TO USE A LOT OF FROSTING
hb3_mYgx7co_6 YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE OFF FROSTING AFTER YOU'VE FINISHED COVERING THE CAKE
hb3_mYgx7co_7 THE ONE IS A LOT OF FROSTING TO AVOID GETTING ON CLONES IN IN YOUR FROSTING
hb3_mYgx7co_8 SO WE'LL START HERE AT THE HERE AND TAKE A GOOD DOLLOP OF OF FROSTING AND JUST START BY JUST READING THAT ON
hb3_mYgx7co_9 NOW DON'T WORRY ABOUT GETTING THIS BIG CLUMP UP HERE ALONG THE EDGE
hb3_mYgx7co_10 WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT LATER
hb3_mYgx7co_11 IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE COVER THE SCIENCE AND YOU DON'T GET OVER CRUMBS IN
hb3_mYgx7co_12 NOW TAKE ANOTHER LARGE DOLLOP OF FROSTING AND REMEMBER ALWAYS TO FROST ON TOP OF FROSTING
hb3_mYgx7co_13 SO INSTEAD OF STARTING HERE WE YOU AND IF YOU WANT TO START A LITTLE BIT FURTHER UP ON TOP OF FROSTING AND CONTINUES READING ALONG THE SIDE FOLLOWING THE CONS WORE OF OUR BEAR
hb3_mYgx7co_14 ALWAYS STARTING A LITTLE BIT BACK WE'VE ALREADY FROST AND USING A LOT OF FROSTING AND WORK YOUR WAY AROUND THE CAKE SIDE SAYS THREADING THAT FROSTING DOWN
hb3_mYgx7co_15 AND NOT WORRYING ABOUT IT BEING GLOBBY UP HERE
hb3_mYgx7co_16 WE'RE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT COVERING THE SIDE AND THEN AFTER WILL GO AROUND AND SMOOTH IT OUT
hb3_mYgx7co_17 A AND GO ON A ROUND THE CAKE AND I'M COMING UP HERE BACK AROUND THE YEARS AND SPREADING ON THAT FROSTING
hb3_mYgx7co_18 SEE HOW I MOVE THIS BACHELOR FOLLOWING THE CONTOURS OF THE CAKE AND PUTTING ON PLANTING OF ICING OF FROSTING COMING AROUND
hb3_mYgx7co_19 NOW WHEN YOU MOVE YOUR SPATULA BACK AND FORTH THIS MOVE THE ICING ON THE SIDE YOU YOU TO SORT OF A EDGE TO EDGE YOU
hb3_mYgx7co_20 THIS END AND THEN BACK TO THAT EDGE
hb3_mYgx7co_21 AND GO AND SMOOTH AROUND THE KING
hb3_mYgx7co_22 NOW AT THIS POINT YOU CAN JUST CHECK ANY THE EDGES THAT YOU'RE THAT AREN'T THOSE MOVE
hb3_mYgx7co_23 YOU CAN CHECK ALL THE EDGES
hb3_mYgx7co_24 SEE I HAVE A NICE RIB OF FROSTING COMING UP ON THE SIDE PLENTY OF FROSTING
hb3_mYgx7co_25 AND IN THE CAKE IS SHIFT NICELY LIKE A BEAR
hb3_mYgx7co_26 NEXT WE'RE GOING TO FROST THE TOP OF THAT
grR8kJlpJ_4_1 OUR EIGHTH MATH LITTLE THE SEASONINGS AND FLIP THE FOUR THEY GET A CHANCE THAT ARE AND THROUGH THE <UNK> AND A HALF A CUFF FOOT I HAVE I'M CAT HAS TO <UNK> AND A LITTLE LESS THAN A FORK A CUP OF WHITE WINE VINEGAR
grR8kJlpJ_4_2 NOW WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR THAT TO REDUCE ONE TO GET OUR A BOWL AND OUR STRAINER AND ONE LOVE THEM
grR8kJlpJ_4_3 UP AND FOR THE STRINGER IT OVER THE BOWL AND CUT THIS LEMON AND HALF
grR8kJlpJ_4_4 ALL OF THEM AND GO AHEAD AND SQUEEZE RIGHT OVER THE TOP
grR8kJlpJ_4_5 AND THE REASON WHY WE DO THIS ENSUED DOING STRAIGHT INTO OUR SAUTE PAN IS THAT YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE SEEDS HERE AND SO YOU DON'T WANT ANYONE TO CHOKE FROM THE SEED WHEN REPEATING THIS DISH
grR8kJlpJ_4_6 AND WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO BE STICKING YOUR FINGERS AND PULL THEM OUT
grR8kJlpJ_4_7 FRONT REDUCED ELEVEN WELL AND IT OR A TRIP
GaD-KlI54ic_1 IT CREATES A TEXTURE IF YOU CAN ALSO GO INTO IT WITH A BRUSH
GaD-KlI54ic_2 I WOULD USE A CHEAT BRUSH NOTHING AND NOT A VERY GOOD BRUSH AND YOU CAN START PUSHING THIS AROUND SORT OF LIKE AN E WASH OR EIGHT ON OR A YOU KNOW ANY OTHER FLUTE MEDIUM
GaD-KlI54ic_3 YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU GET A LOT DARKER WITH THAT AND YOU CAN GET WITH A STRAIGHT PENCIL THAT AND YOU CAN ALSO PLAY AROUND WITH THIS ON AND PUT JUST A LITTLE BIT IN HERE
GaD-KlI54ic_4 WHICH IS IN A PLAY AROUND WITH JUST MOVING IT AROUND WITH A BRUSH IT AND A LITTLE BIT OF ALCOHOL
GaD-KlI54ic_5 THIS WON'T WORK SO WELL AT THIS WON'T WORK WITH WATER
GaD-KlI54ic_6 WATER WON'T WORK WITH THIS
GaD-KlI54ic_7 YOU REALLY NEED THE ALCOHOL TO ALONG TO SCATTERED THE PIGMENT AND ON THEN WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED AND EVERYTHING IS DRY
GaD-KlI54ic_8 YOU REALLY DO NEED TO TREAT THIS WITH ANY <UNK> ON A FIXATIVE A SPRAY FIXATIVE
GaD-KlI54ic_9 ALSO THE OTHER THING TO KNOW ABOUT THIS IS THAT YOU CAN MOUNTING RACES
GaD-KlI54ic_10 YOU CAN ERASE THAT AS LONG AS IT'S KEPT DRIVE
GaD-KlI54ic_11 YOU WILL BE A LITTLE RACE THAT
GaD-KlI54ic_12 ONCE YOU'VE I'M SORT OF MIXED IT WITH THE ALCOHOL YOU HAVE LOST YOUR ABILITY TO RAISE
GaD-KlI54ic_13 SO YOU HAVE TO KIND OF GO WITH THE FLOW BUT THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO START OR YOU KNOW I'M BRINGING FLOW WITH IT SEE INTO GRAPHITE
GaD-KlI54ic_14 IT IS ALSO A WONDERFUL WAY JUST TO GET BEAUTIFUL GRAPHITE WASH IS
h0bjJlC-XfQ_1 SO IF WE TAKE IN HIS OWN IMAGINATION THE PRETEND THAT WE'VE GOT TEN DOLLARS IN EACH ONE OF THESE CONTAINERS
h0bjJlC-XfQ_2 ONE DROP SOAK REPRESENTING A DOLLAR BILL AND WE TIED EVEN THOSE OUT JUST TO GET THE SAME LETTUCE AT REPRESENTING CLEANING OUR WILL GO HER AND LENGTHENING WILL THIRTY DOLLARS VERSES TEN DOLLARS
h0bjJlC-XfQ_3 AGAIN AND SIMPLY TRYING TO GET THE SING LETTUCE SAYS IN EACH ONE OF THESE CONTAINERS REPRESENTING CLEANING OUR
h0bjJlC-XfQ_4 SO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF SO AND WE STILL DON'T GET AS TO THE SIDES AND NOTICE THE CLARITY OF THOSE TWO WIRES
h0bjJlC-XfQ_5 AND WHAT IT WOULD RATHER A THIN
h0bjJlC-XfQ_6 WHICH ONE WOULD RATHER HAVE YOUR CHILDREN BAITING
h0bjJlC-XfQ_7 WHICH ONE WOULD RATHER HAVE IN YOUR OWN
h0bjJlC-XfQ_8 THAT IS WHERE THAT RING IN YOUR BACK FOOT COMES FROM
h0bjJlC-XfQ_9 THAT'S WHERE THAT SOAPS COME BUILDUP COMES FROM
h0bjJlC-XfQ_10 AS WE'RE ALL OF THOSE PROBLEMS ON
h0bjJlC-XfQ_11 THE SPOTS ON YOUR DISHES
h0bjJlC-XfQ_12 AND THEN YOU KNOW THAT THE WE KNEW TOILET
h0bjJlC-XfQ_13 ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE COMING FROM THE QUALITY OF WATER AND ONE AFFECTED BY OR QUALITY OF LEARNING
Gmos790Ildg_1 ESSENTIALLY ROOT WE'VE COMPLETED THE SHAPE
Gmos790Ildg_2 AND OBVIOUSLY IS SENSITIVE
Gmos790Ildg_3 BECAUSE THAT WE WENT TO SURGERY AND AND NOW YOU YOU WANNA OFF DRY OFF
Gmos790Ildg_4 DRY FOR THE DON'T TELL IF A NICE CLEAN TOWEL
Gmos790Ildg_5 AND THEN YOU WANNA APPLY SOME MOISTURIZED TO DO THE ENTIRE AREA SOME TYPE OF LOTION AND THAT WILL WILL SOME OF THE SKIN BECAUSE THE LAYER TO WILL NOW
Gmos790Ildg_6 NOT A BAD BECAUSE WE DIDN'T DO MUCH
Gmos790Ildg_7 BUT IF YOU IF YOU LEAVE ONLY EVERYTHING DRIVE IT YOU FEEL STIFF
Gmos790Ildg_8 IF YOU LIKE SOMETHING IS HALF HAS HAPPENED
Gmos790Ildg_9 YOU PUT ON A LITTLE HOME MOISTURIZER LITTLE WHOLE AREA
Gmos790Ildg_10 AND THAT SHOULD ONCE YOU DO THIS IF ABOUT READY INITIATE A GET EVEN SHADED BECAUSE NOW YOUR SKIN IS RELAXED AGAIN
Gmos790Ildg_11 YOU KNOW IT GETS A LITTLE OF <UNK> AND WHEN THE BODY AND YOU GO THROUGH SURGERY TOMATOES RULER TRAUMA
Gmos790Ildg_12 SO NOW WE PUT ON MOISTURIZER AGAIN IT RELAXES IN AN
Gmos790Ildg_13 THE SKIN ISN'T TIE
Gmos790Ildg_14 YOU'LL FEEL AND THINK PULL IN
Gmos790Ildg_15 THE FIELD BULLET
Gmos790Ildg_16 JUST NOGGLE IT
Gmos790Ildg_17 YOU LOOK GOOD
Gmos790Ildg_19 AND IT HELPS OR CONFIDENCE
Gmos790Ildg_20 THEN YOU MIGHT GET THAT RAISE THAT PROMOTION EVEN EXPECTING BECAUSE YOU HAVE A NICE CLEAN SHAVEN CLEAN
Gmos790Ildg_21 AND IT'S IN THE IMAGE
Gmos790Ildg_22 AND KEEP ONE IS A GOOD IN AND OUT
Gmos790Ildg_23 AND THAT'S IT
hgFreSjB6_U_1 THAT IS A POINT WENCH NICE WIRE TOOL AND THEN VANLANEN AND MOVE IT OVER THE LAST
hgFreSjB6_U_2 I'M NOT LIKE LITTLE LITTLE PROJECTS A JAMAICAN THE WHEEL BETTER TO TAKE THESE BASES AND A REALLY IN IS USING A BAD AND DON'T THEM TAKE THEM OFF OF THAT AND OTHER DIDN'T DRIVES THAT UP
hgFreSjB6_U_3 SO WE'RE HUNTING THIS TRY TO TAKE THIS TO MY WORK TABLE HERE AND IS BY TAKING ENOUGH I CAN TELL IF THAT IS GETTING A GOOD SOLID SHADE GOOD SOLID FORMS OF BOTTOM HEAVY SETUP HEAVY AND BASICALLY SCREAMING AT ME TO MAKE A CANVAS WHERE

g4m9I6gdaaE_27 VERY GOING AND AND SLOWLY COMING UP TURNING FORWARD
g4m9I6gdaaE_28 THIS IS HOW WE PERFORM TWISTING SCISSOR KUNG FU FOR HEALTH
-h8aQ0MdG38_1 STEVE CAVERNO ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE HERE TODAY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT FORMATTING AND PLAY PRODUCTION
-h8aQ0MdG38_2 THE FIRST THING WE'RE AND TALK ABOUT IN FOUR FOUR MANGOES YOUR TITLE PAGE

hbP_MTCUkLw_1 MY NAME'S KEVIN LIKE ME ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND IT'S NOW TIME AND MAINTENANCE WAY STRUCTURES TO TRACK SIDE ON NEW MODEL RAILROAD VILLAGE
hbP_MTCUkLw_2 WE'RE NOW READY TO MOVE ON THE TRACK SIDE AND MAINTENANCE AWAY STRUCTURES
hbP_MTCUkLw_3 NOW THESE BUILDINGS WOULD'VE BEEN USED BY RAILROAD OPERATORS IN REAL LIFE
hbP_MTCUkLw_4 WE WANT TO GET THE DETAIL SO WE END UP DOING THEM AND SCALE AS WELL
hbP_MTCUkLw_5 A LOT OF THESE POWER IS A LOT OF THESE LITTLE STATIONS OF HAVE VIA WILL SHEDS FURTHER AWAY VEHICLES AS WELL AS WORKER SHEDS
hbP_MTCUkLw_6 THE WATER PUT THESE IT CLOSE TO THE TRACK IS POSSIBLE SENSOR WOULD'VE BEEN USED BY THE RAILROAD PEOPLE
hbP_MTCUkLw_7 NOW TRACK SIDE STRUCTURES ALSO INCLUDE ANY LIGHTING OR SIGNALS IT WITH AN PLACED ALONGSIDE THE TRACK
hbP_MTCUkLw_8 IN A DISPLAY THIS SIZE I WOULDN'T NORMALLY GO FOR THAT KIND OF DETAIL
hbP_MTCUkLw_9 IN A BIGGER DISPLAY YOU CAN ACTUALLY PUT SIGNALS IN BUT YOU CAN USE AS YOUR OPERATING THE LAYOUT WHICH IS CRITICAL
hbP_MTCUkLw_10 SO NOW WE'RE READY TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STEP
ghRSBlBdC64_1 ALRIGHT SO MAYBE ONE OF THE ONES THAT FURTHER AND NOT JUST MAKE MONEY FROM YOUR CREATIVITY BUT YOU WANT IT TO BE YOUR CAREER

ghRSBlBdC64_11 FOR CAREER SPECIFICALLY THE COLOR WOULD BE BLACK AND WE ALSO TALK ABOUT WATER IN THIS AREA AS WELL FOR FLOW
ghRSBlBdC64_12 SO YOU CAN USE MIRRORS YOU CAN USE PICTURES WITH WATER IN IT
ghRSBlBdC64_13 HI I'M IN YOU ALSO AND MAKE SURE THAT THE DO WE'RE IS ACTUALLY WORKING WELL
ghRSBlBdC64_14 THE ACTUAL DOOR IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT
ghRSBlBdC64_15 DOES IT CLOSE ALL THE WAY
ghRSBlBdC64_16 IF IT A LITTLE BIT STEP
ghRSBlBdC64_17 DID THE DOOR KNOB TURN
ghRSBlBdC64_18 A THAT FALL KNOCK THE HINGES

H9z4FIxNLyM_1 HI I'M AMELIA AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THE LAWS OF HAIR COLOR
H9z4FIxNLyM_2 THIS IS A POCKET COLOR WHEEL THAT SHE CAN GET AT ANY ART SUPPLIES TO
H9z4FIxNLyM_3 OR IF YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHAT I'M DOING WITH THAT
H9z4FIxNLyM_4 WILL ACTUALLY THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT
H9z4FIxNLyM_5 BECAUSE WITHOUT AND THIS YOU REALLY CAN'T COUNTERACTS THE DIFFERENT COLORS THAT ARE GOING ON IN YOUR HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_6 SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
H9z4FIxNLyM_7 AT EVERY LEVEL THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED IN UNDERTONE IN YOUR HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_8 IN OTHER WORDS THAT EVERY LEVEL IF I WAS TO PUT BLEACH STRAIGHT ON THE HAIR AND LIFT IT TO YOUR LEVEL WHAT WOULD BE THE COLOR THAT WOULD BE REMAINING IN THE HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_9 SO FIVE TO THE THE OUTSIDE COLOR OFF WHAT WOULD BE THE INSIDE COLOR IN A MANNER SPEAKING
H9z4FIxNLyM_10 WELL AT A LEVEL SIXTY INSIDE COLOR WOULD BE ORANGE
H9z4FIxNLyM_11 AND LET'S BE HONEST NOBODY REALLY WANTS ORANGE HERE
H9z4FIxNLyM_12 SO WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU HAD ORANGE HERE
H9z4FIxNLyM_13 WELL YOU WOULD PUT BLUE COLOR ON IT
H9z4FIxNLyM_14 AND WHAT WOULD THAT DO
H9z4FIxNLyM_15 THAT WOULD MAKE IT A NICE NEUTRAL BROWN
H9z4FIxNLyM_16 SO THESE ARE THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN PERFORMING COLOR ON YOURSELF AT HOME
H9z4FIxNLyM_17 I'VE SEEN A LOT OF WOMEN COME INTO THE SALON AND THEY GET THE DARK ROOTS AND THEY'VE OF THE REALLY BRASSY AN
H9z4FIxNLyM_18 AND WHAT I MEAN BY BRASSY IS THAT NICE ORANGE COLOR THAT'S A LEVEL SIX
H9z4FIxNLyM_19 AND THE WINDS NO WIFE LIKE THAT AND HAVING TO EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IS WHEN THEY PUT THE COLOR ON THEIR HAIR FIVE WEEKS AGO THAT PROBABLY DON'T USE OF IN PRODUCTS OR A GOOD SHAMPOO AND THE COLOR THIS FADED OFF
H9z4FIxNLyM_20 AND WHAT'S LAUGHS IS THE UNDER TOWN
H9z4FIxNLyM_21 WHAT'S LAUGH IS THE UNDERLYING COLLAR
H9z4FIxNLyM_22 WHAT'S LEFT IS WHAT'S SHOWING WITH UNDERNEATH THE HAIR WITH UNDERNEATH THE COLOR
H9z4FIxNLyM_23 SO WHEN I HAVE TO APPLY A CORRECTIVE BASE I CHOOSE A COLOR THAT HAS A BLUE BASE
H9z4FIxNLyM_24 SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS RANGE I WOULD SHOES SOMETHING MORE IN THIS LET'S RED VIOLET IN THIS ASH FLEW OVER HERE
H9z4FIxNLyM_25 SO I WOULD HAVE TO APPLY A LITTLE LEVEL SIX A B AND THAT WOULD COUNTERACT IN MAKER AND NICE NEUTRAL SIX AN
H9z4FIxNLyM_26 SO WHENEVER YOU'RE APPLYING COLOR AND YOU'RE WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT BEEN IN THE GRASSY THAT YOU NOT IN A POOL WARM YOU HAVE TO TAKE IN CONSIDERATION YOUR LEVEL THE LIGHTNESS AND ART IS IN YOUR HAIR AND THE TONE OF YOUR HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_27 SO IF YOUR WARM NOT AWARE THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF RED IN YOUR HAIR FOR GRANDMOTHER WAS A RED HEAD YOU'RE NOT IN ONE OF PUT RED ON YOUR HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_28 AGAIN ONE AND SHOES NAVY IN ASHLEY'S
H9z4FIxNLyM_29 AND NOW ASH FACE WILL ENCOUNTER ACTS THAT ONE FINGER HERE AND MAKE A NICE NEUTRAL COLOR
H9z4FIxNLyM_30 SO WHEN EVER CHOOSING A COLOR ALWAYS TAKE IN CONSIDERATION THE UNDERLYING TONES IN YOUR HAIR
H9z4FIxNLyM_31 ARE YOU WARM OR ARE YOU COOL
H9z4FIxNLyM_32 AND IF YOU WARM AND ONE STAY WARM YOU APPLY A WARM COLOR
H9z4FIxNLyM_33 IF YOU WARM AND ONE OF THE NEUTRAL OR COOL YOU APPLY A COOL COLOR
H9z4FIxNLyM_34 SO WHENEVER YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE COLOR WHEEL OR WITH EVERYTHING ABOUT COLOR REMEMBER THE COLOR WHEEL
H9z4FIxNLyM_35 WHATEVER COLOR IS ACROSS FROM THE COLOR YOU WANNA BE THAT THE COLOR THAT SKIN INITIALIZE IT
H9z4FIxNLyM_36 SO THIS YELLOW ORANGE BLUE VIOLET ISN'T INITIALIZE THAT AND MAKE A NICE BROWN BASE
H9z4FIxNLyM_37 SO MY ONE IF IT ONE OF THESE OUT IF I'M IN AND DO A LOT HOME COLOR
G6LG4wlD8gs_1 HELLO WELCOME MY NAME IS JULIO NUTT
G6LG4wlD8gs_2 I'M A MASTER INSTRUCTOR OF THE JIM MCLEAN GOLF SCHOOL IN MIAMI FLORIDA
G6LG4wlD8gs_3 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO FIX YOUR GOLF SWING
G6LG4wlD8gs_4 IS THAT IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO KNOW WHEN UNDERSTAND THAT THE THAT BASE WAY TOWARD THE SWING IS THROUGH THE RULES THROUGH PRACTICING THE DIFFERENT MOTIONS AND THAT THE FRIENDS BOX OF THE SWING
G6LG4wlD8gs_5 MANY AMATEURS JUST WANT TO JUMP BEING AND THE ONE AND READ THE FIVE IRON AND THE ONE HEAVE FLOW SHOT'S WAS A FIVE IRON ON
G6LG4wlD8gs_6 THEY IT'S BAD THIS WHEN TO CHANGE RATHER HITTING FULL SWING
G6LG4wlD8gs_7 IT'S ANOTHER EASIER TO WRAP A WEDGE A NINE IRON AND JUST MAKE HAVE SWING
G6LG4wlD8gs_8 HALF CONNECTED SLEEVES IF YOU WORK IN SOMETHING IN DIRT TAKE A WHITE FOR WORKING SOMETHING TO RELEASE
G6LG4wlD8gs_9 WE'RE JUST TAKE IT GO UP IF YOU WORK IN SOMETHING AT THE TOP OF YOUR SHOE IN AND JUST PRACTICE THAT POSITION
G6LG4wlD8gs_10 IF YOU'RE WALKING MAYBE IN AN OPEN CLUB FACE YOU HAVE YOU HAVE YOUR LEFT RULE IS DUE TO BEND AND TAP
G6LG4wlD8gs_11 GO AHEAD AND FILL THE CORRECT POSITION
G6LG4wlD8gs_12 NOW AN ADVANTAGE YOU CAN ALSO CLOSE YOUR EYES AND IS GOOD TO THE CORRECT POSITION AND YOU FEEL THE RIGHT POSITION
G6LG4wlD8gs_13 FEEL YOUR BODY PARTS WOULD WHERE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE AND WAS REPETITION YOUR MUSCLE MEMORY IS GONNA RIP THROUGH THE MOMENT AND HAS BEEN HOW TO MAKE A VERY GOLF SWING
gC1kAU1Jsoc_1 HELLO MY NAME IS HUGH OR ON HOW TO A FOOT LIMIT ON THE INITIAL HOW TOO COLD GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE
gC1kAU1Jsoc_2 THE FIRST RECIPE I'M GOING TO SHOW IS HOW TO MAKE GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE FROM SCRATCH
gC1kAU1Jsoc_3 THEN WE WILL TURN UP THE HEAT OR DISTILLED COMES UP HOW ALL WILL OR ADD IT TO A BOIL
gC1kAU1Jsoc_4 <UNK> AND WE WILL CLICK ARCHANGEL SALT SO THAT IT WILL COOK A GREEN COLOR ALL THE GREEN BEANS AND YOU'VE GOT A GREEN BEANS BEING THE WHOLE OLDER AND LET IT BOIL FULL OUR ARMS FULL TO FIVE MINUTES
gC1kAU1Jsoc_5 NEW NUDY CONSTANTLY ANYTHING WITH THE GREEN BEING OUT TO REDUCE THE WHITE SLICE RING IS
gC1kAU1Jsoc_6 ONCE THAT BEING BEING A SPRAY THE RESISTANCE THAT DURING THE GREEN BEANS INTO US FREEING IS ON
gC1kAU1Jsoc_7 YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUN THEM IS THIS EVERY EATING RUNNING WATER
h0w8WiVr6UY_1 THE OTHER ESSENTIAL TOOL FOR BEAT MAKING IS A KILN
h0w8WiVr6UY_2 AND AS MENTIONED IN EARLIER SEGMENTS THE KILN FOR FORMS TO FUNCTIONS
h0w8WiVr6UY_3 IT ALLOWS THE B TO COOL OFF VERY GENTLY SO AS TO AVOID THERMAL SHOCK WHICH WILL CAUSE CRACKING IN A BEAD
h0w8WiVr6UY_4 AND IT ALSO IMPORTANTLY PERFORMS THE FUNCTION OF ANNEALING THE BEAD ANNEALING IS THE PROCESS OF MAKING HAPPY GLASS MOLECULES
h0w8WiVr6UY_5 WHERE THE GLASS MOLECULES GET THE VIBRATE
h0w8WiVr6UY_6 ANNEALING DOESN'T CHANGE THE LOOK OF THE BEAT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE SHAPE OF THE BEAD
h0w8WiVr6UY_7 BUT IT GETS THE TEMPERATURE HIGH ENOUGH IN IN THE CASE OF THE EFFECT TRAY ITALIAN GLASS WERE USING NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT GETS THE GLASS HOT ENOUGH SO THAT THE MOLECULES IN THE BEAD FORM GET TO VIBRATE AND KIND OF MOVE A LITTLE BIT
h0w8WiVr6UY_8 SO THEY CAN WORK OUT ANY STRESS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE
h0w8WiVr6UY_9 WHEN WE MAKE A BEAD WE'RE INTRODUCING LOTS OF FOCUS HE INTO ONE PARTICULAR ZONE AND OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE THAT NOT BE SO LOCALIZED
h0w8WiVr6UY_10 BUT TO HAVE THAT HE DISTRIBUTED EVENLY IN THERE ARE MODERNIZATION PROCESSES WE USE IN MAKING THE BEADS
h0w8WiVr6UY_11 OR WE DO A NICE KIND OF MARSHMALLOW TESTING OF THE BEAD AFTER WE'VE WORKED ON ONE DOT AREA ARE WHEN DESIGNING AREA
h0w8WiVr6UY_12 HAVE A LOT OF AS A BECOME CLEAR AS WE GO THROUGH THE SEQUENCES OF THE ACTUAL BEAD MAKING STEPS
h0w8WiVr6UY_13 AND ANY EVENT THE ANNEALING KILN IS A FURTHER HOMOGENIZING UP INFLUENCE ON THE GLASS AND HELPS ENSURE THAT THE GLASS BEAD THAT YOU MAY ONCE IT COMES DOWN TO ROOM TEMPERATURE WILL NOT CRACK
h0w8WiVr6UY_14 THERE ARE SPECIAL TONES MADE FOR THIS AND THEY ARE BE JONES
h0w8WiVr6UY_15 A CERAMIC COUNT CAN THEORETICALLY B IS FOR MAKING OUTLETS BEADS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE SUPER CAREFUL NOT TO INTRODUCE THE GLOVE THE METAL ROD THAT YOU MAKE A BEAD ON INTO ANY OF THE ARM ELECTRIC ELEMENT FEATHER PART OF THE COW
h0w8WiVr6UY_16 BECAUSE IF YOU DO YOU STAND THE RISK OF ELECTROCUTE IN YOURSELF
h0w8WiVr6UY_17 SO A DETAIL WILL TYPICALLY HAVE EIGHT COUGH CHAMBER WHERE THE ELECTRODES ARE THE RACKING NEVER WITH TOUCH THAT WITH METAL DIRECTLY EXPOSED
h0w8WiVr6UY_18 BUT THERE'S AN UNDER NOT UNDERNEATH CHAMBER WHICH HAS USUALLY A MASH SEPARATION WHERE YOU PHYSICALLY CANNOT INTRODUCE YOUR METAL MANDREL WHICH IS HOLDING YOUR BEAD TO AN ELECTRO BY ACCIDENT
h0w8WiVr6UY_19 AND I'M A WILL GET ANOTHER PICTURE OF THE BEAD CONE LATER ON YOU CAN SEE THE DOOR
h0w8WiVr6UY_20 BUT A B TONE OF THE GREAT TO ONLY COSTS ANYWHERE FROM BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED DEGREES
h0w8WiVr6UY_21 SOME OF THEM HAVE CONTROL OF DOLLARS EXCUSE ME SOME OF THEM HAVE CONTROLLERS WHICH AUTOMATICALLY ADJUST THE TEMPERATURE AND OTHERS JUST SIMPLY USE A VARIABLE ON SPEED SORT OF THE TENSION ON THAT ARE DIAL ENOUGH TO KEEP LOOKING AT THE HYDROMETER WHICH TELLS YOU WHAT TEMPERATURE YOU'RE OUT
h0w8WiVr6UY_22 ON THE KILN I'M USING IT'S NOT FANCY WE HAVE NO PROGRAMMABLE COMPUTER AND DOESN'T KEEP IT AT A CERTAIN HAMSTER
h0w8WiVr6UY_23 I'M ALWAYS HAVING TO LOOK AT THAT HYDROMETER TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM MAINTAINING THE TEMPERATURE IN ONE
h0w8WiVr6UY_24 IN THIS CASE RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT MY PARAMETER IN IT INDICATING OF HARD TO SEE OF COURSE BUT TAKE MY WORD FOR THAT'S ABOUT NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE SEVENTY FIVE FAHRENHEIT
h0w8WiVr6UY_25 EIGHT THOUSAND IT STRAIGHT UP ON THAT MIDDLE FLASH
h0w8WiVr6UY_26 THE METHOD HYDROMETER AND THIS IS MY THE KILN AND THEN THESE ARE AVAILABLE TO FROM ANY OF THE GLASS APPLY HOUSES
h0w8WiVr6UY_27 WITH RESPECT THAT THAT TONE FUNCTION OF ANNEALING AND HEATING THERMAL SHOCK AWAY THE PARTICULAR VEHICLE I HAVEN'T IF HIS IS ALSO SERVES A VERY VALUABLE SAFETY FUNCTION
h0w8WiVr6UY_28 BECAUSE IF THE BEAD WHEN IT GOES INTO THE CALLUM WITH IT DOES NOT RISK GETTING UP INTO CONTACT WITH ELECTRODES THAT ARE LOCATED ABOVE BECAUSE OF THE SEPARATION BETWEEN THE UPPER CHAMBER AND THE BOTTOM CHAMBER
h0w8WiVr6UY_29 YOU'LL NOTICE THERE'S A MASH SCREEN FOR YOU WOULD NEVER PUT OF FEEL MANDREL INTO THIS TOP AREA BECAUSE THAT CAN ELECTROCUTE YOU
h0w8WiVr6UY_30 BY TOUCHING THE MANDREL TO THE ELECTRODES YOU CAN GET IT A INJURING OR KILLING SHOCK
h0w8WiVr6UY_31 SO OF THE KILN IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT AGAINST THIS IN HAS A SEPARATION SCREEN BETWEEN THE B CHAMBER AND WHERE THE ELECTRODES ARE ACTUALLY LOCATED
GmSipqvuo3A_2 MY NAME IS NANCY ADLER AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE TODAY AND WE KNEW TENT TEACH YOU TELL YOU HOW TO OPERATE A CINEMA A MOVIE THEME

gEOHN9Y1QCo_1 THE LAST THING I WANT TO TRY AND USE THIS TO ONE CREATES MORE SEPARATION AND THAT WONDER KEARY BEHIND THE NECK IS LITTLE FRUSTRATING
gEOHN9Y1QCo_2 SO I HAVE SET UP ANOTHER LAYOUT ANOTHER HOUSEHOLD LAND BACK BEHIND THIS THING
gEOHN9Y1QCo_3 IT TURN IT ON AND SEE WHAT WE GET

gEOHN9Y1QCo_27 LIKE THE OBJECT FIRST YOUR PRIMARY SURFACES DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANNA HIGH LIKE THE REFLECTIONS OR WHETHER YOU WANNA CONCENTRATE ON THE OVERALL SHAPE
gEOHN9Y1QCo_28 LIGHT IT SO THAT EVERYTHING IS VISIBLE ON AND THEN COME BACK IN USE OTHER LIGHTS TO TO USE TO CREATE HIGHLIGHTS DRAMA DIFFUSION SO THAT YOU NOT SEEING DISTRACTING REFLECTION WORTH REFLECTOR WITH REFLECTIONS OR WERE FRACTIONS ON THE SURFACE OF THE INSTRUMENTS AND THEN COME UP WITH A LIGHTING SYSTEM THAT WORKS TO HELP SEPARATED FROM THE BACKGROUND AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING CHRONIC SHOTS

GD4d-f-mp9I_1 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE MY NAME IS CRAIG MORRELL
GD4d-f-mp9I_2 I'M WITH LANDSCAPE RESTORATIONS IN MIAMI FLORIDA
GD4d-f-mp9I_3 WE'RE HERE AT PALM HAMMOCK ORCHID ESTATE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PLANTING AND FERTILIZING
GD4d-f-mp9I_4 IN THE TITLE OF THIS CLIP IN IS TO BUILD YOURSELF A DAMP
GD4d-f-mp9I_5 NOW NOT REFERRING TO THE HOOP OR DAMAGE GRAN CRU LEE A DAM AROUND YOUR PLANTS
GD4d-f-mp9I_6 THE IDEA ABOUT THIS IS TO KEEP THE WATER CENTERED ON THE PLANT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE WORKING ON A SLOPE LIKE THIS ONE
GD4d-f-mp9I_7 WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS RIGHT AFTER WE PLANTED OUR PLANT WE'RE GONNA MAKE OURSELVES A LITTLE EARTHEN BAM FEW INCHES D SO THAT THE WATER THAT WE PUT IN HERE AT THE BASE OF THE PLANT STAYS HERE
GD4d-f-mp9I_8 AND WILL SLOW DOWN THROUGH THE WILL BE IN SLOW
GD4d-f-mp9I_9 THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY THE PALMS OF OR FOR FREE
GD4d-f-mp9I_10 YOU CAN BUILD OF AND THAT MIGHT BE FOR FIVE FEET ACROSS IN ABOUT A FOOT TALL THE WHOLE SMALL LAKE OF WATER
GD4d-f-mp9I_11 SO ONCE WE GET THIS THE HEALTH OUR WATER STAYS RIGHT WE WANT TO RIGHT HERE
GD4d-f-mp9I_12 SO ALL WE'RE GONNA DO A FAKE THAT BACK FILL IN AND MAKE OURSELVES A LITTLE EARTH ENDING
GndDItpzJOo_1 HOW TO MASTER THE OVER TECHNIQUE
GndDItpzJOo_2 LIKE ANYTHING WE DO IN OUR PERSONAL LIVES OR OUR DOG LIVES ROUTINE AND REPETITION COMMITMENT AND DEDICATION WILL PREVAILING

GndDItpzJOo_5 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE SAME HEIGHT VARYING HEIGHT WILL BE GOOD SO YOUR DOG TRULY NEVER KNOWS WHAT TO EXPECT WITH THE NEXT OVER COMMAND
GndDItpzJOo_6 SO TO SUMMARIZE ROUTINE LAP REPETITION OF COMMITMENT AND DEDICATION WILL ALL <UNK> TEACHER DOG THE OVER COMMAND
GndDItpzJOo_7 THEREFORE WHEN YOU GET THE COMPETITION ANY WITH OR HEIGHT OF STACK WILL BE A LOT EASIER COOKED FOR YOUR DOG TO MASTER
HEQ9KoTGaM4_1 OFF HEIGHT NOW HERE WE GO SYNCOPATION

HEQ9KoTGaM4_4 IT'S COULDN'T BE BURN IN
HEQ9KoTGaM4_5 WE'RE JUST IN A WALK KEEP IT UP THERE
HEQ9KoTGaM4_6 IT'S IN THE PLAY ALL EIGHTH NOTES <UNK>
HEQ9KoTGaM4_7 <UNK>
HEQ9KoTGaM4_8 THERE'S NOT A REALLY REALLY A LOT OF ACCENTS THERE
HEQ9KoTGaM4_9 IT'S JUST IN A KEY GROOVE AND AWAY ON IT
HEQ9KoTGaM4_11 NO ACTIONS ANYTHING JUST STRAIGHT
HEQ9KoTGaM4_14 SO THAT'S THE MOVIE ARE DRIVER COME ON AND THE ON YOU KNOW AND THE ARM THE LEG AND IS GROOVE
HEQ9KoTGaM4_16 IT'S IN A PUSHES GROOVE FOLLOWER AND WHATNOT AND ON IT CAN BE THE ONE THAT IN IT YOU KNOW KIND OF GET UP MAKE HIM BUT DANCE

HEQ9KoTGaM4_19 AND I CAN MOVE THAT ANYWHERE
HEQ9KoTGaM4_20 I CAN MOVE THAT'S THE BODY OF THE CYMBAL WHEN KEEP ON THE BELL
HEQ9KoTGaM4_21 WORKING ON OUR ALTERED
G5JmKsIULig_1 IF IT IS A COUPLE OF THINGS I THINK WILL BE IN A <UNK> TO FULLY IT'S AWESOME
G5JmKsIULig_2 BECAUSE ON ITS OWN LITTLE FOR THE GROUP HEAD YOU KNOW THE EVERYTHING HAS BEEN COVER

h9L80BtdN2A_5 AGAIN YOU WANT TO AVOID STANDING UP TO STRAIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR STEMMING BECAUSE YOU WON'T HAVE ANY OPPOSITION ANNUAL SLIP
h9L80BtdN2A_6 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE KEEPING YOUR HAND LOW ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN PUSH NOT REACHING TOO HIGH BECAUSE THAT WILL AGAIN ELIMINATE YOUR OPPOSITION FORCES BECAUSE IT IS FLAT
h9L80BtdN2A_7 ONCE YOU GET IT RIGHT IT'S REAL STABLE MIGHT EVEN GET LOW HAND REST FOR ONE
gSg8EX84TYU_1 A HIGH E STRING THIN TEETH FLAVOR
gSg8EX84TYU_2 FROM THE USE BLACK TEA BECAUSE SO MANY OUT THERE DURING FLUFFY
gSg8EX84TYU_3 FLUFF SO THAT ALL OF THIS IS ABOUT TEN TWELVE OUNCES OF THE FOOT AND I LIKE NINETY STRONG <UNK> HAVE THIS HAS A FOOD FOR EXAMPLE
gSg8EX84TYU_4 I'VE USED A GOOD AMOUNT FOR MY EIGHT TO TEN OUNCES OF I WANT TO TRY IT STRONGER
gSg8EX84TYU_5 FLAT FEE YOU SHOULD NOT LETTING GROOVE OR TOO LONG SO USE THE BACK BECAUSE WITH THE BATH YOU CAN LET IT SIT FOR AN ALLERGY LETTERS FOR THE WHOLE DAY AND YOU GET A STRONG UP BUT IF THE THREE WITH THESE THE THING
gSg8EX84TYU_6 FLIP LOOSE LEAF TEA IS VERY DIFFERENT
gSg8EX84TYU_7 YOU'LL NOTICE RIGHT AWAY WHEN AND PUT IN THE BOILING WATER THAT THE COLOR WILL CHANGE IN THE THING AMOUNT TIME
gSg8EX84TYU_8 YOU NOTICE THE COLOR DIFFERENCE RIGHT AWAY IS THE LIGHTER FOR NOW IS THE DARKER BROWN IN THINLY
gSg8EX84TYU_9 YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT THE A FIVE MINUTES AND NO DIFFERENCE OF THIS ONE'S A LOT STRONGER THAN THIS ONE
gSg8EX84TYU_10 AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME OF QUICK BREW WITH A LOT OF TEA LEAVES AND THE WAY TO GO
gSg8EX84TYU_11 SO IN ORDER FETA MAKE STRONG TEA I DON'T RECOMMEND LEAVING IT FOR TOO LONG
gSg8EX84TYU_12 I ALWAYS RECOMMEND ADDING MORE TEA LEAVES IN USING A OVER AND OVER FOR MORE TEA
gSg8EX84TYU_13 TO MAKE STRONGER HERBAL TEA YOU'RE WELCOME TO LEAVE IT FOR A LONG TIME BUT FOR GREEN TEA AND ALONG USING WHITE TEA LEAVES IS THE BEST WAY TO GO AND INCREASING THE TEMPERATURE OF A LITTLE BIT WOULD BE THE THE OF THE OTHER OF TURN
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_1 HI THIS IS AARON HALE IT'S OFTEN IS FOR LIFE IN WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA OF ALL HERE TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO GAIN UPPER BODY STRENGTH
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_2 FIRST AND FOREMOST OF <UNK> TROT EXAMPLE BY STRENGTH ALL THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS GET ON A WORKOUT SCHEDULE THAT WE KNOW THAT WE CAN ADHERE TO MAINTAIN A CONSISTENT WORKOUT WITH
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_3 AND IF WE CAN MAINTAIN A CONSISTENT WORKOUT BEEN IN NORTH MORE LIKELY THE CHANCES OR THE RUG AND START SEED CHANGE AND STRENGTHEN ENDURANCE INCREASE IN OUR BODIES OFF SECOND OFF IT
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_4 WE CAN IF WE CAN FIND A OF A WORKOUT SCHEDULE THAT WOULD IN HERE TO I'M CAN STAY CONSISTENT WE HAVE TO CONTAIN A CHANGE UP THE WORKOUT
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_5 IF YOU DO IN THE SAME THING TIME AND TIME AGAIN EVENTUALLY THE BODY'S GOING A STOP RESPONDING TO THIS WORKOUT
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_6 IF YOU DO IN A BENCH PRESS AND CONTINUE DID BENCH PRESS ALL THE TIME YOU NEED A CHANGE TO A DUMBBELL PRESS
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_7 MATING THE CHANGE INTO AN INCLINE DUMBBELL PRESS ODD EVEN SETTLE FLAT BENCH MAYBE EVEN DO SOMETHING UP THIS ALL THE SMITH MUSHY
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_8 AND THERE'S ALWAYS DIFFER WAYS WE CAN TARGET THE SAME MUSCLES IN THAT SAME SPOTS IN THOSE MUSCLE FIBERS DIFFERENTLY THAT CAN CONTINUE THE SHOT THE BODY TO THE BODY'S CAN RESPOND
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_9 NUMBER THREE AND JUST AND JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE OTHERS IF WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR FORM IS CORRECT
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_10 THIS IS WHERE A PERSONAL TRAINER SOMEBODY WHO'S EDUCATE IN THE FIELD OF STRENGTH CONDITIONING REALLY CAN COME IN A PLANK IS AGAIN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR BODY MECHANICS INFORMERS PROPER
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_11 IF YOUR FORM OF SLOPPY IN ON THE CAN SHABAD BODY IS NOT IN RESPOND THE WAY YOU WANT TO SET UP THOSE THREE THINGS AGAIN WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN HERE TO A SCHEDULE OF ITS CAN WORK FOR US BENEFIT FROM SIEVE CONSISTENCY BEING A BIT WHEN A LOT OF
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_12 SECONDLY YOU GOTTA CONTAIN A CHANGE OUR WORKOUTS MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CHANGING THE WEIGHT WITH CHANGING THE WAY WE DO THOSE THOSE WORKOUTS AND LASTLY JUST AS IMPORTANT LENGTH ON MAKE SURE THAT OUR FORM IS PROPER
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_13 IF WE CAN MAINTAIN A PROPER FORM TO WORK WITH SOMEBODY HIDDEN HIS BID EDUCATE IN THE FIELD CAN SHOW YOU HAD A STATE OF FOCUSED ON HOW YOU WILL SEE THE RESULTS ARE LOOKING FOR
Gv_s-FFtKKQ_14 THAT CAN AARON HALE HERE AT FITNESS FOR LIFE IN WILMINGTON NORTH COUNT
HhgieT3w08k_1 I HAVE
HhgieT3w08k_2 <UNK>
HhgieT3w08k_3 NEVER TALK ABOUT <UNK> OLLIE OR ON WERE
HhgieT3w08k_4 CALL OF DUTY FOUR MODERN WARFARE IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF ACTIVISION A COMPANY WITH THAT REALLY AGE
HhgieT3w08k_5 IT IS JUST A COOL LEVEL
HhgieT3w08k_6 IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT
HhgieT3w08k_7 THERE'S NOT A LOT OF GAMES THAT HAVE THE TWO MAIN SNIPER TEAM
HhgieT3w08k_8 AND REALLY GET INTO A COUPLE REALLY HAIRY SITUATIONS IN THIS LEVEL
HhgieT3w08k_9 BUT YOU GOTTA MAKE SURE YOU GET A ONE SHOT LONG TAIL AND ON HIS FIRST OF THICK AND A HALF WAY POINTS OR WHATEVER WITH CAPTAIN MACMILLAN HERE HANDS WERE AFTER GO THROUGH A FEW FEW LITTLE THINGS WITH TAKE HIM DOWN SOME OF OUR SOME GUARD POSE AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT YOU GOT YOU HAVE TO GET THE ONE SHOT UNTIL TO BEGIN WITH HERE
HhgieT3w08k_10 OTHERWISE WILL GET FLAP FOUND OUT AND ABOUT
HhgieT3w08k_11 I DON'T THINK THERE'S A WEEK AND FIND OUT OF OUT OF THOSE SITUATION <UNK> IF THEY'RE ON CLIMATE HALF ON
HhgieT3w08k_12 HE GIVES YOU THE OPTION HERE OF TO SHOOT THIS GUY OR LET HIM GO HOME ALL HANDS HIM ATTENDED IS LIKE TO LET THIS ONE GO
HhgieT3w08k_13 AND YELLOW ONES I'LL KILL I USUALLY LIKE THIS ONE GO BECAUSE THIS HOUSE IS FULL OF GUYS AND IF THEY SEE HIM GET SHOT WERE YOU KNOW ANYTHING GOES WRONG THE ONICA MOUNT
HhgieT3w08k_14 SO I LIKE TO GO I LIKE TO JUST LET THIS ONE GO AND HE JUST WENT BACK INSIDE SO WORDS CAN STAY ON CAPTAIN MACMILLAN SIX
HhgieT3w08k_15 GONNA DO THAT THROUGHOUT THIS LEVEL
HhgieT3w08k_16 JUST STAY WITH THEM WHERE EVERY GOES WITH EVERY DOES
HhgieT3w08k_17 JUST DO WHATEVER HE GOES
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_1 I'M TIM GIPSON AND I'M A TALKING ABOUT HANG A PICTURE
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_2 NOW THE FIRST THING WE'LL LOOK AT WHEN YOU'RE HANGING YOUR PICTURES OR LOOK ON THE BACKSIDE AND SEE WHAT TYPE OF ATTACH POINT IT HAS
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_3 AND THAT PARTICULAR PICTURE THAT ALMOND HANG RIGHT NOW AS YOU CAN SEE AS THIS CLASS AT THE TOP THAT'LL HANG ON A HOOK OR A NAIL OR SCREW
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_4 AND SAY ON THE BACK OF THIS PICTURE YOU'LL SEE THIS ON HEAVIER PICTURES OR A HEAVIER MIRRORS OF WHAT YOU ACTUALLY SEE THIS WIRE THAT A STRONG FROM EACH SIDE
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_5 AND SO THIS IS DESIGNED TO HANG ON A ON THE HOOK THAT GOES INTO THE WALL
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_6 NOW IF WE HAVE OTHER WHAT WOULD GO TO DETERMINE IS WE GO DETERMINE ARE HANG POINT TO ONE GERMAN HOW HIGH THAT WE WANT THIS ON THE WALL
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_7 A LOT WITHOUT <UNK> WILL SAY WELL WE WANT RIGHT THERE OKAY
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_8 NOW WE CAN HOLD THIS ONE POINT
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_9 FROM TIME TO GO TO GET OUR SHOULDERS AND HAND INVOLVED
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_10 AND THEN WE'LL TAKE OUR PENCIL AND WE CAN MARK THE COPPER THE PICTURE
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_11 NOW WE MARK THE TOP OF THE PICTURE BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHERE WE WANT WITH A HANGER
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_12 AND THERE ARE SEVERAL HANGERS THAT WE CAN USE A I'LL TALK ABOUT THIS POINT
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_13 SO WHERE WE HAVE THIS CLIP NOW IN THE WALL RIGHT HERE VARGA REINSTALLED THAT IN HALF AND BE A STUD RIGHT HERE WHERE THIS PICTURES GOING
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_14 SO NECK CASE YOU CAN JUST AN ALIEN A BROADHEAD NAIL OR JUST A STANDARD COMMON NAIL AND THAT'LL HOLD THAT
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_15 THE OF BOA YOU HAVE THE WIRE THEN YOU'LL WANT TO USE A HOOK LIKE THIS THAT JUST GOES INTO THE NAIL
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_16 IF YOU HAVE HEAVIER DEVICES WE ACTUALLY HAVE A SCREW IN ANCHOR LIKE IS THIS OR JUST A STANDARD ANCHOR WHERE YOUR DRILL A HOLE AND THEN YOU WOULD USE A SCREW INJURED CATCH POINT
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_17 SO REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW HEAVIER ITEM IT
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_18 FOR HANGING IS WHAT WE WANT TO DO TWO OR MEASURE DOWN FROM THE TOP
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_19 IN THIS CASE IS THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH SO WE WOULD COME ONTO LINE WHERE WE WANTED TO MEASURE THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH DOWN AND THAT'S WHERE WE WERE DRIVE OR NAME
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_20 SO ONCE YOU GET AN ALLEN THERE'S JUST SIMPLY LOCATING AT AND MAKING SURE IT HANGS LEVEL
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_21 NOW IT'S A GOOD IDEA WHEN YOU DO IN THIS TO HAVE A TORPEDO LEVEL WHICH IS A SHORT LITTLE LEVELED ITCHING PUT ON TOP HELP YOU MAKE SURE YOU HANG A SLOW
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_22 AND THAT'S ALL OR IS IT
gxcxxP7Q0Fg_23 I'M TIM GIBSON AND THAT'S HOW TO HANG A PICTURE
gBgxA_jCk0A_1 EYES THIS I OWN WITH EXPERT VILLAGE AND THERE WE TALK ABOUT MAKING A <UNK> INJURY
gBgxA_jCk0A_2 I'M NOT IS MULTI COMPLETELY ATTAR WAX PAPER READY
gBgxA_jCk0A_3 WHICH AND GO AHEAD AND POUR THIS ON HERE AND I'LL SET THIS ASIDE FROM FROM COME FLATNESS OUT FOR WHEN YOU ACTUALLY DO THROUGH FAKE THIS IF YOU FOLD IT OVER THAT WE CAN MANIPULATE WHAT'S GOING ON FROM THE FOOT JUST DECIDE TO WATCH OUT ITSELF A BIT WARM IF YOU NOTICE IT LOOKING AT IT FOR BUT IT IS
gBgxA_jCk0A_4 SO ONCE TO IT FITS WITH THIS OUT
gBgxA_jCk0A_5 WITH THAT A QUARTER OF AN INCH FIFTH TO HALF AN INCH THAT WHITE IN BETWEEN AND
gBgxA_jCk0A_6 THROUGH FLATNESS ON EVEN FOR ME WHICH WOULD USUALLY GO AHEAD AND THROW THIS IN THE OVEN FIN AUDIO IN THE REFRIGERATOR
gBgxA_jCk0A_7 IF THE FOOT OFF BECAUSE IT'S THE ONE PIECE FLUID AND FOODS THAT OVER <UNK> AND WHAT IS IT BUILDS QUICK ALL ABOUT FIVE TEN MINUTES
GpOM5HnCHpo_1 HI I'M JAN KAIN
GpOM5HnCHpo_2 CONTINUING ON WITH OUR TIGHT US IN TODAY
GpOM5HnCHpo_3 A RIBBON AND MOVE FORWARD INTO AGGRESSIVENESS THERE ARE STILL SEQUENCE
GpOM5HnCHpo_4 LAST MOVEMENT WE DID WAS LOOKING INTO THE PALM SHIFTING THE WEIGHT ON THE LEFT
GpOM5HnCHpo_5 SO NEVER IN AND MOVE ON AND NEXT MOVE IN OUR TIGHT SHE SERIES OR GRASPING IS THERE'S TAIL SEQUENCE IS THAT IF YOU WERE OFF
GpOM5HnCHpo_6 SO MAKE SURE LOOKING IN YOUR LEFT HONG WEEDS ALL AND LEFT LANE
GpOM5HnCHpo_7 NOW I CAN PICK UP THE RIGHT FOOT
GpOM5HnCHpo_8 AS YOU GET READY TO STEP TOWARDS THE RIGHT BOTH HANDS OPEN FLIP OVER HIS STET AGAIN HEEL TOE SHIFT THE WEIGHT FORWARD ALL AND THE RIGHT LANE
GpOM5HnCHpo_9 BY A SQUARE
GpOM5HnCHpo_10 AND YOUR HANDS LOOK LIKE IT'S HE
GpOM5HnCHpo_11 RIGHT HAND CASES YOU LEFT PAR FACES AWAY
GpOM5HnCHpo_12 SING THE WEIGHT INTO YOUR HIPS MORE WEIGHT ON THE RIGHT FOOT AND THE LEFT
GpOM5HnCHpo_13 BECAUSE WARD OFF IS WE ARE READY ALWAYS READY FOR AN OPPONENT
GpOM5HnCHpo_14 SO THIS IS ALSO WORKING STRENGTH BALANCE COORDINATION LET IT INNER STRING
GpOM5HnCHpo_15 BUT IN MEDITATIVE ASPECTS MOVING ON IT SHEET AND LET IT ENERGY AND FORCE
GpOM5HnCHpo_16 SO FROM HERE WITH A RATING MOVE LINE
GpOM5HnCHpo_17 TO THE NEXT STEP IN THE SEQUENCE
GiguArk30IQ_1 LIFE IS PROBABLY BE AN OF AROUND AS LONG AS WE HAVE PICKED UP SOMETHING AND SCRATCHED AND MARK WITH IT
GiguArk30IQ_2 OUT SO THE FIRST THING THAT WE DO WHEN WE STARTED ROLL IT ON OUTLINE DRILL ALONG WITH THE THE ROUND LINE AND SO ON SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT GLOWINGLY ALMOST ALWAYS CAN THINK OF LINE
GiguArk30IQ_3 BUT THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT LINE IS USED
GiguArk30IQ_4 THIS IS A PICK ALSO OF PAINTING AND THIS IS USING THE LINE AS THE CLONE TOOL TO SHOW YOU YOU KNOW WHAT THE SHAPE OF THE BODY IT'S A THIS IS A CONTOUR LIE
GiguArk30IQ_5 AND HE'S DEPENDING ON THAT IT IS REALLY WITHOUT A LINE THIS WOULD JUST BE A LOVELY GROUP OF YOU KNOW COLORS WHEN IT'S MUCH TOGETHER
GiguArk30IQ_6 IT'S THE LINE THAT SORT OF HELPS GIVE THIS AN ACTUAL SUBJECT
GiguArk30IQ_7 COMPARED TO THAT WE'VE GOT THIS USE OF LINE WHERE YOU'VE ACTUALLY SAYS OF USING OF WHITE LINE ON BLACK INSTEAD OF BLACK ON WHITE AND THIS IS A VERY SOONER FREE WHAT WE WOULD CALL IT WAS WOODEN CALLIGRAPHIC LINE VERY CURLY AND VERY FREE
GiguArk30IQ_8 IT'S A LOT ABOUT THE GESTURE OF THE FIGURE ALL SET
GiguArk30IQ_9 IT'S VERY SIMPLE THIS DRAWING IS JUST IS ABOUT LINE AND IT'S ABOUT BLACK AND WHITE THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT
GiguArk30IQ_10 YOU IT AND HAVE LINEAR ELEMENT SOMETIMES
GiguArk30IQ_11 THIS IS A SKULL AS SERIES OF SCULPTURES AND IT'S PLAYING WITH THE IDEA OF LINED REACTING WITH THE SPACE SO IT'S NOT A DRAWING OF LINE ON A PIECE OF PAPER OF BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A DRAWING REALLY WITH WITH STEEL IN SPACE
GiguArk30IQ_12 SO YOU DON'T LIKE IT IS THAT LINE IT'S NOT JUST THE MARK FOR MAKE WITH A PENCIL
GiguArk30IQ_13 THEY MADE THIS PICTURE USING THE EDGE OF THE RED IN AS A LINE AND THEN THEY REPEATED TO LINE TO CREATE THE SHADE
GiguArk30IQ_14 SO THAT'S NOT REALLY AN OUTLINE BUT IT IS A VERY THIS IS BASICALLY A DESIGN BASED ON USING LINE
GiguArk30IQ_15 LOT ALSO AND I HOPE YOU CAN SEE THIS CAN BE USED TO CROSS HATCH AND CREATE MOVEMENT SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND FORM INSTEAD OF USING VALUE TO UNDERSTAND FORM
GiguArk30IQ_16 THE MOVEMENT OF THE LINING KIND OF CREATES THE FORMS SO THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL THE PEDALS UNFOLDING IN THIS RENDITION OF THE ROPES
gVKwgUxyCIo_1 A ONE AND TURN HER IN ALL THAT LIVE
gVKwgUxyCIo_2 YOU COULD USE TESTING I'M STANDING HAS AN <UNK> AND <UNK> FRET THAT THE OF OF MOVEMENT
gVKwgUxyCIo_3 ONCE YOU
gVKwgUxyCIo_4 AND SO IT AND HOUSE AND SEND IN <UNK>
gVKwgUxyCIo_5 THIS ISN'T WALLS
gVKwgUxyCIo_6 IF THAT IS THE ONLY A SECOND SEATS THAT IN THE NEW SETTLE THOUGHT OF THAT IS THE END
gVKwgUxyCIo_7 IF YOU SING OUT INTO THE WRISTS THAN <UNK> AND <UNK>
gVKwgUxyCIo_8 THE TWISTING ASCENDING LET THAT SENSE OF GENTLY IN MOVING OF MEATBALLS THAT POSITION
gVKwgUxyCIo_9 SO WHEN YOU SAY THIS YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN A SLOW
gVKwgUxyCIo_10 SO AS YOU CONSULT ROSIN CONCESSIONS IT
gVKwgUxyCIo_11 IN SOME OTHER OPTIONS <UNK> WITH THE FINS
gVKwgUxyCIo_12 GIVE THEM SOME AS HE WON'T LAST PHASE HUMANS THAT SAYS SOME OF THE LINES
gVKwgUxyCIo_13 THEY'VE WANT REASONABLE EVERY OUT OF THAT TESTING I'M STANDING IS USED IN AS HIT HIM WITH GOING FROM ITS OWN
gVKwgUxyCIo_14 LET ME AND WE'RE NOT AND IT'S THE SENSE OF WHAT <UNK> WILL STALL YOU MIGHT WANT ANY WILL A LIGHT THE EQUIPMENT OFF WHEN WE OF UNLESS IT
gVKwgUxyCIo_15 SO IT LIGHTLY OF <UNK>
gVKwgUxyCIo_16 WHEN YOU DO IT WITH ONE OUT OF IT FROM GETTING BROUGHT WE'RE IT'S THAT ONE
gVKwgUxyCIo_17 A MEETINGS IN THEM
gVKwgUxyCIo_18 AND PRETTY AMAZING OF AT HOME
gVKwgUxyCIo_19 AND A FULL WILL THINK HE'S THE ADDED I THINK IF THINGS IN EYES
gVKwgUxyCIo_20 AND THE <UNK> INTO OUR ONION SONGS IN JUST A MINUTE OF <UNK> ONE ON HER
gVKwgUxyCIo_21 HE SAID UNUSUAL THAT YOU'LL IT'S IN OF THE OVEN LONG AND SET
gVKwgUxyCIo_22 THIS INSURANCE OF INTO AND IN THE NEXT FEW BOUTS IT COULD BE FEDERAL OFF
gVKwgUxyCIo_23 HE SAID AN AGENT SHE'LL THESE INTO ANY OF BEING FULLY AND IT'S WHOM
gVKwgUxyCIo_24 ISN'T THAT GO CAMPING
gVKwgUxyCIo_25 SO IT'S A JUDGMENT ON FOR A YOU CAN
gVKwgUxyCIo_26 WHAT WHEN I THREW WE GO
gVKwgUxyCIo_27 OH MY UP ONE LIKE THAT AGENT VINTAGE
gVKwgUxyCIo_28 A CENT UNIT SO IT KIND OF SHIFTING THE BOTTOMS OF HAS BEEN HAS
gVKwgUxyCIo_29 WOMAN WORMS AND IN THE OVEN SUCCESSFUL AND ONE THING THE AVERAGE
gVKwgUxyCIo_30 AND ON HIS WAS THE EDGE
gVKwgUxyCIo_31 SHE'S AND SIZES
gVKwgUxyCIo_32 <UNK> <UNK> GOOD
gVKwgUxyCIo_33 THE <UNK>
gVKwgUxyCIo_34 LISTEN TO SOME HOME OFFICE THEM IS SEE MOST OF THEM IT AS IN HAS A
gVKwgUxyCIo_35 <UNK> IS ONE INVITED OF IN THE HEAT IN
gVKwgUxyCIo_36 HE'S STILL SOMETHING WHO'S IN THE <UNK> AND <UNK> IN A LITTLE BE REPETITIVE EVEN
gVKwgUxyCIo_37 AND AND NOT IN A THING THE ARMS
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_1 I AM OUTWARD LEFT BACK ON AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M AN <UNK> GRIT WILL ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE A BIG YOUR <UNK>
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_2 SO WHAT I JUST MADE VIDEO RESUME
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_3 APPEARANCES IMPORTANT FACTOR VIDEO RESUME
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_4 AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT LEGALLY ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE CAN BENEFIT
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_5 IT DOESN'T MEAN A PROFESSIONAL PRESENCE IT REQUIRED
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_6 MAKE SURE IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE JOB AND SUGAR PURSUING
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_7 IF POSSIBLE USING RESEARCH AND INDUSTRY STANDARD PRACTICE IS A VERY PROFESSIONAL ATMOSPHERE THIS THE ENTIRE IRON
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_8 REMEMBER THE DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND EVEN DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION IS AT DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF PROFESSIONAL ATTIRE
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_9 AND HE'S CUTS FOR EXAMPLE SELF PROFESSIONALS ARE VERY FORMAL RARELY RISI ANYONE VILLAINS WILL CALL WITHOUT IS TOO HIGH AND JACKET EVEN THE DENTIST ARE
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_10 ON THE CONTRARY ON THE WEST COAST MANY CELLS PROFESSIONALS WHERE TIRE THAT WERE CLOSELY RESEMBLES A PROFESSIONAL GOLFER RATHER THAN A SCALE THREAT HAPPENS AND COLOR SHORTS ARE OFTEN CONSIDERED DRESSED UP
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_11 ALWAYS ERR ON THE SIDE OF TWO PROFESSIONAL IF YOU'RE IN CERTAIN
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_12 NO ONE WILL THIS PLENTY FOR LOOKING SHE NICE
g9HmSWzBJ1Y_13 IF YOU CREATE A VIDEO RESUME ENGINES A TEE SHIRT YOU PROBABLY HURTING YOURSELF
gBEv-iksiNo_1 NOW LET'S INSERT THE MATCHES INTO THE PAPER TOWEL ROLLS
gBEv-iksiNo_2 WE'RE GOING TO INSERT THE MATCHES WITH A WOODEN PART OF THE MATCH THE STICK PART INSIDE ALL THE WAY UNTIL THE THE TIP OF THE MATCH IS JUST STICKING OUT IN CAN GO IN ANY MORE
gBEv-iksiNo_3 GIVING YOU CAN SEE INSIDE THAT ONCE THE MATCH STICKS ARE ARE THERE THERE CREATING THAT TYPE OF ON ON OBSTACLE FOR WHEN THE RICE FLOWS DOWN IT'S GOING TO BE HITTING THOSE MATCH STICKS AND MAKE IT GO DOWN MUCH SLOWER AND THAT'S GOING TO CREATE THE SOUND OF THE RAIN
gBEv-iksiNo_4 SO THE RELIABLE PUTTING THE STICKS IN WITH THE THE WOODEN SIDE IN FIRST IS ONE BECAUSE THE THE TIPS OF THE MATCHES GIVE A DECORATION TO THE STICK AND THE OTHER REASON IS BECAUSE THE TIP OF AND THAT'S ALSO HELPS THE STICK FROM KNOCK GOING THROUGH ALL THE WAY TO THE END
gBEv-iksiNo_5 KIND OF THEM GIVES THAT HAS A STOP WEARS ABLE TO JUST STICK UP UP FROM THE PAPER TOWEL ROLL AND NOT BE AND GET LOST INSIDE INSIDE THE HOLE
gBEv-iksiNo_6 SO THOSE ARE THE REASONS WHY WE'RE PUTTING THE THE WOODEN PART IN FIRST
gBEv-iksiNo_7 NOW IF YOU WANTED TO YOU COULD USE COLORED MATCH STICKS ON MATCHES RATHER WITH THE THE HEAD OF THE MATCH IS A DIFFERENT COLOR UNEVEN ALTERNATE THOSE COLORS
gBEv-iksiNo_8 WE'RE USING ONE COLOR WHICH IS RED WHICH IS USUALLY COMMONLY FOUND AMONG WOULD MATCH STICKS THAT THEY DO HAVE DIFFERENT COLORS AND ON IF YOU CAN UPS AND THEN YOU CAN YOU CAN REALLY MAKE A NICE DECORATION UNDERSTATE USING THE ALTERNATING COLORS AND THEY GET DIFFERENT DESIGN WITH THEM
gBEv-iksiNo_9 BUT THAT WE CAN SEE THE SINCE WE MADE THE HOLES ALONG THE SEAM LINE WE CAN SEE NOW WHY WAS IMPORTANT TO MATCH UP THE HOLES ALONG THE SEAM LINE BECAUSE THE ON THE WATER TO HAVE A CONTINUATION OF THE MATCH STICKS GOING FROM THE TOP TO BOTTOM
gBEv-iksiNo_10 THAT'S WHY WE MATCHED UP SO IT LOOKS VERY SYMMETRICAL
gBEv-iksiNo_11 THE LONGER THE ROLL LOSE THE MORE MATCHES WILL BE ABLE TO PUT IN AND THEN THEY'LL BE MORE OBSTACLES FOR THE RICE GOING DOWN
gBEv-iksiNo_12 AND AGAIN THOSE OBSTACLES THE RICE HITTING THE MATCH STICKS IS WHAT'S CREATING THE NOISE SO IT'LL GET A MORE OF AN EFFECTIVE YOU'VE WHEN USING THE LONGER ROLL AND ABLE TO INSERT MORE MATCH STICKS
gBEv-iksiNo_13 SLEEP OR THE MATCH STICKS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE END
gBEv-iksiNo_14 FOR THIS PROJECT WE'VE USED ABOUT OF A BOX AND A HALF MATCH STICKS
gBEv-iksiNo_15 AND IT'S GOOD TO HAVE AT LEAST TO MATCH THAT MATCHBOXES ON HAND
gBEv-iksiNo_17 JUST IN CASE YOUR RULES ARE LONGER THAN ONES WE USED
gBEv-iksiNo_18 AND WE SEE THIS IS HOW THE STICK LOOKS ONCE THE MATCH STICKS ARE PLACED INSIDE ALONG THE SEAM LINE AND WE SEE THAT THERE'S SPACED EVENLY
gBEv-iksiNo_19 THEY GO ALONG THE SEAM FROM TOP TO BOTTOM SO IT HAS A NICE EVEN SMUDGE WILL LOOK TO IT
gBEv-iksiNo_20 AND I'VE SHOWN YOU HOW TO PLACE THE MATCH STICKS INSIDE THE ROLLS
HgZReSHdveQ_1 LET'S TALK NOW ABOUT HOW TO STORE YOUR HOOKS ON YOUR TIP UP WHEN AN EITHER YOUR HOME OR YOU'RE ON THE ICE IN YOUR TRIP UP IS NOT A NEWS
HgZReSHdveQ_2 YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO LEAVE A LINE DANGLING
HgZReSHdveQ_3 EVERYTHING IS GONNA GET TANGLED
HgZReSHdveQ_4 ALL YOUR TRIPLES WILL BE TANGLED TOGETHER WITH ALL YOUR OTHER EQUIPMENT
HgZReSHdveQ_5 THE OTHER THING YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS ACTUALLY PUT YOUR HOOK INTO YOUR LINE TO HOLD IT BECAUSE ALL YOU'RE DOING IS CREATING WEAK SPOT ON YOUR LINE
HgZReSHdveQ_6 I'M I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE AND OFTEN TIMES WILL ALMOST COMPLETELY WENT THROUGH ICE FISHING LINE
HgZReSHdveQ_7 IT'S HARD TO GET THE HOOK OUT AND AGAIN IT CREATES A WEAK SPOT WHERE IF YOU DO GET A BIG FISH THAT'S GONNA BE THE SPOT WHERE LINE BRAKES
HgZReSHdveQ_8 AS AN ALTERNATIVE YOU CAN SIMPLY PUT THE HOOK INTO THE WOODEN END OF THE OF THE TIP UP
HgZReSHdveQ_9 NOW THAT'S A GOOD PLACE TO HOLD THE THE WHAT THAT WILL DO OVER TIME IS DELL YOUR HAWKEN YOURS WOJNAR HOAXES SHARP AS POSSIBLE TO INCREASE YOUR HOOKUP RATES
HgZReSHdveQ_10 THERE'S A COUPLE OTHER METHODS
HgZReSHdveQ_11 ON YOU CAN PURCHASE STRAPS LIKE THAT'S THROUGH SOME SPECIALTY COMPANIES
HgZReSHdveQ_12 THE HOOK SIMPLY GOES IN THOSE VELCRO YOU WIND IT AWAY FROM YOU IN THERE
HgZReSHdveQ_13 OR YOUR HOOKS CONTAINED
HgZReSHdveQ_14 IT'S NOT EXPOSE WAS NOT AND CATCH AND ANYTHING
HgZReSHdveQ_15 YOU LINE IS IN A COME OUT THIN NOT ANY GET TANGLES
HgZReSHdveQ_16 NOW A CHEAPER AND EASIER METHOD IS SIMPLY TO USE A RUBBER BAND
HgZReSHdveQ_17 THE HOOK GOES AROUND THE RUBBER BAND
HgZReSHdveQ_18 YOU TWIST IT ONCE OR TWICE HOLD IT STEADY BRING IT BACK A COUPLE TIMES SIMPLY TWIST IT BRING IT OVER THE LINE AND YOU HOOK IS SECURED
HgZReSHdveQ_19 IT'S NOT A TANGLE IT'S NOT A DAMAGE OR EQUIPMENT IS NOT IN A GAME OF THE HOUSE
GUQo3MA2MyE_1 NEXT WE'RE IN A STARTED BASICALLY FLESH OUT OUR CHARACTER HERE
GUQo3MA2MyE_2 IN THAT SCENE OF IN A START DRAWING IN SOME LIKE THE SHOULDER REGION HERE
GUQo3MA2MyE_3 NO DRUM BASICALLY PUTTING CLOTHES ON THE YOUNG SKELETON WE'VE DRAWN IN HERE BECAUSE THAT'S IN A PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT IS
GUQo3MA2MyE_4 AS LITTLE MORE THAN A SKELTON
GUQo3MA2MyE_5 THE NICE THING IS AN CAN PRETTY MUCH FOLLOW ALONG HERE AND BE ABLE TO CUT A C WORMING DETAILS ARE GOING TO GO BECAUSE THESE ARE LIGHT WONDERFUL GUIDES FOR US
GUQo3MA2MyE_6 I MEAN IT'S BEEN IN THE LIKE THE QUICKEST ON EACH SIDE OF THE LINES
GUQo3MA2MyE_7 THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG LESSONS YELLOWS ON MAKE SURE AND LEARN
GUQo3MA2MyE_8 AND THEN YOU KNOW THIS IS A HERO
GUQo3MA2MyE_9 HERO'S ARE ALL ABOUT HOW THE SHAPES
GUQo3MA2MyE_10 WHAT DO I MEAN BY COMMON SHAPES
GUQo3MA2MyE_11 WHAT I MEAN IS THIS
GUQo3MA2MyE_12 SEE THIS RIGHT HERE
GUQo3MA2MyE_13 THIS IS A BULGING MUSCLES
GUQo3MA2MyE_14 IT'S A DIAMOND SHAPE
GUQo3MA2MyE_15 US NORMAL DUDES HIT WE HAVE PRETTY MUCH A STRAIGHT LINE FOR LUCKY
GUQo3MA2MyE_16 OR YOU'RE BUILDING UP THE OTHER WHEN AN UNCOMMON THIS MUSCLE FLATTERING
GUQo3MA2MyE_17 SO IT'S ALL THE EYE DRAWING IN REALLY POWERFUL POSES
GUQo3MA2MyE_18 YOU KNOW YOU WANT SOME YOU JUST HANG AROUND SLACK ENOUGH
GUQo3MA2MyE_19 THESE ARE HERO
GUQo3MA2MyE_20 THEY'RE OUT FINE CRIME
GUQo3MA2MyE_22 SO WE CONTINUE BASICALLY COME IN HERE AND THE DETAILS OR AND FINISH BASICALLY OUTLINING OUR BODY
GUQo3MA2MyE_23 AND IT'S ACTUALLY AFTER THAT PAIN WHIRL AND IN THE DETAILS ADDITIONAL DETAILS LIKE ON THE COSTUME IN THE LIKE
GUQo3MA2MyE_24 NOW WE HAVE OUR BASIC DYNAMIC POSE
GUQo3MA2MyE_25 ALL THE FLESH AND BONES ARE ON THERE BUT YOU KNOW I'LL DISCUSS LOOKING A LITTLE A BLANK
GUQo3MA2MyE_26 SO LET'S START DRAWING THE DETAILS NOW
GUQo3MA2MyE_27 IN IMPORTING GERMANY'S DETAILS ARE THEY SHOULD FOLLOW THE CONTOUR OF THE BODY
GUQo3MA2MyE_28 THAT'S ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO DO BECAUSE THIS IS NOT LIKE A FLAT OBJECT IN OR HOW IT LOOKS OF THE LINES HAFTA ADD THAN FLOW AND FOLLOW ALONG IN DIFFERENT AREAS
GUQo3MA2MyE_29 BECAUSE THIS IS IN A LIVING BREATHING COMIC CREATION HERE
GUQo3MA2MyE_30 THIS IS NOT ON NOT A STATIC INDIVIDUAL
GUQo3MA2MyE_31 THE SCISSOR REAL BREATHING PERSON
GUQo3MA2MyE_32 SO IN MAKE SURE THAT THE LINES ACCOUNT FOR THAT AS OR DRAWING THINGS IN
GUQo3MA2MyE_33 ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS IN SPIDERMAN WHERE THE MOST NERVE RACKING IS ALWAYS DRAWING IN THE EYES RIGHT
GUQo3MA2MyE_34 SPIDERMAN ALWAYS HAS THOSE CRAZY EYES AND IT'S SO EASY TO MESS UP ON
GUQo3MA2MyE_35 AND SEE IF YOU DO LIKE OH BOY HERE AT SET
GUQo3MA2MyE_36 SECOND LIKE A DRAW THEM AND IS REALLY MUCH MORE START AT FIRST
GUQo3MA2MyE_37 THIS IS REALLY SKY GIVING YOU AN IDEA OF HOW THINGS THIS POSTER GOLF
GUQo3MA2MyE_38 I RECOMMEND WITH YOUR PENCIL BULLET TRACING A VERY VERY LIGHT LINE OVER THINGS FOR THE TIME BEING
GUQo3MA2MyE_39 DOES NOT TO BE DARK YOU MIGHT BE COMING BACK IN HERE MAKING CORRECTIONS LATER ON
GUQo3MA2MyE_40 VERY FEW DRAWINGS ARE DRAWN IN PERFECTLY IT THE FIRST TIME
GUQo3MA2MyE_41 IF ANYBODY ELSE'S TELLING DIFFERENT AS WELL THAT IS NOT BEING ROUNDS WITH THE
GUQo3MA2MyE_42 IT'S WITH THAT
GUQo3MA2MyE_43 SO LET'S BRING THESE LINES DOWN HERE DOES IS IT A GOOD WEDDING PART OF SPIDERMAN'S COSTUME
GUQo3MA2MyE_44 SPIDERMAN HAS DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS COSTUME
GUQo3MA2MyE_45 AND KEEP THAT MY
GUQo3MA2MyE_46 ACTUALLY IN SOME WAYS IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN SOME OF THE CHARACTERS YOU LIKE OR SUPERMANS YOUR BAT MAN'S THE WORLD OF RELATIVELY SIMPLE COLOR SCHEME WHEN IT COMES THEIR COSTUMES
GUQo3MA2MyE_47 SPIDERMAN SPIDERMAN'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED

H748Z8Xfhmc_1 NOT LIKE REHABILITATION IS JUST RECENTLY AND ACTUALLY BECOMING A PROFESSION
H748Z8Xfhmc_2 I'M ON THE THIRD GENERATION WILDLIFE REHABILITATE OR
H748Z8Xfhmc_3 MY GRANDMOTHER GOOD AT MY MOTHER DID IT IN
H748Z8Xfhmc_4 I GREW UP DOING IT
H748Z8Xfhmc_5 BUT FOR THOSE OF US THAT WE'RE DOING AND ALL THESE YEARS IT WAS MORE LIKE A HOBBY

H748Z8Xfhmc_12 THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE CONNECTED WITH COLLEGES IN STATE PARKS AND THEY DO A LITTLE BIT OF WILDLIFE REHABILITATION BUT BY ENLARGE MOST OF THE WON LIFE REHABILITATE IS IN OUR STATE OR ACTUALLY HOME BASED REHABILITATORS
H748Z8Xfhmc_13 BECAUSE IN OUR STATE WE CANNOT CHARGE FOR ANYTHING WE DID
H748Z8Xfhmc_14 WE CAN EVEN CHARGE FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT WE'D

H748Z8Xfhmc_16 DIFFERENT STATES HAVE DIFFERENT GUIDELINES RE IN RULES AND REGULATIONS INVOLVING THEIR PAR MATS FOR THEIR WILDLIFE REHABILITATION EDUCATION OF BUT IN OUR STATE WE CAN DO IT
H748Z8Xfhmc_17 SO WE SURVIVE STRICTLY ON DONATIONS

gyj39v1OG1A_6 MY LITTLE THERE WAS A PROFESSIONAL CALLIGRAPHER IS THE ZEBRA AND THE REASON I CHOSE A ZEBRA IS BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP OF BLACK AND WHITE AND THE NEGATIVE SPACE
gyj39v1OG1A_7 IT SAYS IT'S IS IMPORTANT TO SEE THE WHITE SHAPE IT'S CARVED OUT BY THE BLACK MARKS AND THAT IS TO SEE THE BLACK MARKS
gyj39v1OG1A_8 GO SAUT SOMETHING CALLED COUNTERS OR THE NEGATIVE SPACE INSIDE THE LETTERS

hiIHTYpRh8Y_2 THE SIXTY DEGREE CAUGHT IS PRETTY MUCH THE MOST LOFTED CLUB THAT MOST PEOPLE MOST PLAYERS WILL USE

gOLkajVzsEc_1 HI I'M PATTI GERMAN AND I'M A LICENSED MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST HERE IN NEW YORK CITY
gOLkajVzsEc_2 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO HANDLE ACHIEVING GIRLFRIEND
gOLkajVzsEc_3 THE FIRST PART IN AN UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'RE GIRLFRIEND IS CHEATING ON YOU IS TO GET PROFESSIONAL HELP
gOLkajVzsEc_4 I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN HANDLE THIS ON YOUR OWN
gOLkajVzsEc_5 THERE ARE MANY MANY REASONS WHY A PERSON IS NOT STAYING LOYAL IN A RELATIONSHIP
gOLkajVzsEc_6 AND IN THE EXCITEMENT OF SOMEONE ELSE ENTERS INTO IT
gOLkajVzsEc_7 SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU SEE COUNSELING MARRIAGE COUNSELING AT THIS POINT BECAUSE IT IS TO STOP THE THE THE PAIN AT THAT POINT OUT A PROFESSIONAL PERSON CAN HELP UNDERSTAND HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE CHEATING
gOLkajVzsEc_8 WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE NOT STAYING OIL
gOLkajVzsEc_9 WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE TRAINING
gOLkajVzsEc_10 AND IT'S TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME BUT IT'S A TRUE INDICATION THAT A RELATIONSHIP HAS PROBLEMS
gOLkajVzsEc_11 SO TO CLARIFY A ON IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU GO TO A MARRIAGE COUNSELOR WHETHER YOU'RE MARRIED OR NOT TO HELP UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN A RELATIONSHIP
gOLkajVzsEc_12 MARRIAGE COUNCILORS WORK WITH RELATIONSHIPS WITH A PEOPLE OR MARRIED OR NOT
gOLkajVzsEc_13 THIS SOME INDICATION THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM IN THE RELATIONSHIP AND IF IT GOES FORWARD IT'S ONLY GOING TO REPEAT ITSELF AND TRICKLE DOWN IN MANY OTHER AREAS
gOLkajVzsEc_14 SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WHEN YOU DISCOVER YOU GIRLFRIEND IS CHEATING THAT YOU SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP
gOLkajVzsEc_15 AGAIN THIS IS PATTI GERMAN IN NEW YORK CITY
GIdjUXyFdz4_1 IF IT EXCITEMENT AND TALK ABOUT IS IS A STOP WATCH
GIdjUXyFdz4_2 NORMALLY BE THE TIME KEEPER AT RINGSIDE IS GOING TO BE KEEPING TRACK OF THE THE TWO MINUTE ROUNDS ON IN THE MID RESPIRATOR BETWEEN ON IF YOU HAVE THE HEADS UP YOUR STYLE ON APPROXIMATELY WHEN TEN SECONDS IS LEFT IN AROUND YOU CAN TRY TO GET YOUR BOXER A LITTLE BIT MORE ON EXCITED AND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABLE TO FINISH THAT AROUND IN A GOOD POSITIVE WAY
GIdjUXyFdz4_3 SO WHAT TO DO IS YOU HAVE YOUR SYSTEM AND YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO DO THE HEAVIER ASSISTANT KEEP TRACK OF THE TIME AND WHEN HE REACHES A MINUTE AND FIFTY SECOND HE CAN SAY TEN SECONDS AND THEN YOU TAKE A BOXER TEN SECONDS JOE TEN SECONDS
GIdjUXyFdz4_4 DAY THAT ALLOW THAT BOXER THOSE LAST TEN SECONDS
GIdjUXyFdz4_5 THAT'S THE LAST TEN SECONDS OF THE JUDGES THAN A C
GIdjUXyFdz4_6 AS THE MOST IMPORTANT TEN SECONDS
GIdjUXyFdz4_7 IT'S ABOUT THE NOTE IS ONLY TEN SECONDS LEFT YOU MIGHT GET THAT EXTRA LITTLE BIT A WINDOW HE NEEDED ONTO THE BACK OUT THERE AND THEN FINISH STRONG AND A STRONG OKAY ALSO WHEN YOU'RE WORKING IN BETWEEN IN BETWEEN AROUND IN A CORNER IF YOU'RE IF YOUR SYSTEM QUARTER MAN ALSO HAS THE STOPWATCH HE CAN ALERT YOU WHEN THERE'S A POSSIBLY TWENTY SECONDS LEFT OF THE ROUND ON TO THE IN BETWEEN THE ROUND ON
GIdjUXyFdz4_8 THAT WAY BY THE TIME YOU HEAR THE WORD SECOND THOU YOU'LL HAVE TEN SECONDS THAT YOU'VE ALREADY HAD A HEAD START YOU'VE ALREADY PUT A MOUTHPIECE INTO THE BOXER YOU'VE ALREADY GOT HIM READY TO GO
GIdjUXyFdz4_9 SO HAVING A GOOD STOPWATCH AN ASSISTANT TO HELP YOU KEEP TRACK OF IT IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA

GUGpTrCMn70_1 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M NICOLE AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT IGUANAS
GUGpTrCMn70_2 ONE PROBLEM IN FEMALE IGUANAS IN CAPTIVITY IS THAT THEY HAVE A TENDENCY TO BECOME A BOUND
GUGpTrCMn70_3 NOW A FEMALE IGUANA WELL OBVIOUSLY IN LAY EGGS WHETHER OR NOT A MALE IS AROUND
GUGpTrCMn70_4 EVEN IF THE EGGS ENOUGH FERTILE THEY WILL STILL LAY EGGS
GUGpTrCMn70_5 THE MAIN PROBLEM IN FEMALE IGUANAS WOULD BE A DOWNWARD WHICH IS WHERE THEY CAN'T LADY AIDS
GUGpTrCMn70_6 USUALLY CAUSED BY AN IN PROPER HOUSING PROBLEM
GUGpTrCMn70_7 NOW FEMALE IGUANAS NEED TO HAVE A GOOD AREA TO LAY EGGS IF THEY NEED TO OF
GUGpTrCMn70_8 IMMEDIATELY CAT PAN SIZED AREA
GUGpTrCMn70_9 EVEN A CAT HAND WILL WORK GREAT IF YOU JUST FILL IT WITH SOME SOIL ON OR PERMIT YOU I
GUGpTrCMn70_10 THEN THIS WILL PROVIDE A WONDERFUL AREA EVERY GLIDE TO LAY EGGS AND DEFINITELY RELIEVE HER FROM THE STRESS OF BEING A BOUND
GUGpTrCMn70_11 THE ONE IS THAT THE NOLLIE ONE IS THAT ARE NOT KEPT WITH A MALE DEFINITELY TEND TO BE I'M MUCH MORE PRONE TO BEING A GROUND
GUGpTrCMn70_12 SOMETIMES MALE IGUANAS DO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR PRO LAPSING PENISES
GUGpTrCMn70_13 THIS WILL APPEAR AS A LARGE PINK BLOB OF BASICALLY COMING OUT OF THE COCOA AREA UNDERNEATH THE GONNA
GUGpTrCMn70_14 AND THIS IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE TREATED BY A VETERINARIAN
GUGpTrCMn70_15 MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A VETERINARIAN LINED UP BECAUSE WHEN THIS DOES HAPPEN IT'S VERY DANGEROUS TO THE IGUANA
GUGpTrCMn70_16 IF LEFT UNTREATED IT CAN CAUSE THAT THE INFECTION VERY PAINFUL AND IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING IN ONE TAKE TO THE VET IMMEDIATELY
GBgFH6pd22Q_1 AND IN HERE IN THE FIX CLOVES YOU'LL SEE WHICH IS SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE ON THE FLUID WINGS
GBgFH6pd22Q_2 THESE BURNERS WILL ACTUALLY COME ALL THE BOTTOMS OF WINTER
GBgFH6pd22Q_3 IT WOULD LOCK THE STREETS WITH HOLDING THE HANDLE ON LIKE THIS TO THEIR SIDES TO LIGHT UP THEIR WALKWAY IN THE EIGHTEEN FIFTIES
GBgFH6pd22Q_4 THIS BURNER WILL SLIDE RIGHT OWL AND THERE'S WHERE YOUR FLUID WILL BE PUT IN THEM AND HERE ARE THE SMALL TOPS WITH THE WICK ACTUALLY COMES OUT IN BOTH BURNERS
GBgFH6pd22Q_5 THIS BURNER ITSELF IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU WOULD SEE ON ONE OF THESE FLUID LIAM'S
GBgFH6pd22Q_6 IT LOOKS VERY SIMILAR TO THIS
GBgFH6pd22Q_7 THERE'S YOUR ON WICK WHICH IS SATURATED WITH YOUR OIL INSIDE THAT PALM CAN THIS FLUID IS HELD INSIDE THIS CONTAINER SO IN IT SCREWED ONTO A NUMBER ONE FOR A COLLAR
GBgFH6pd22Q_8 SO THIS IS IS NOT IS NOT THE SAME BUT VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU WOULD SEE ON THIS LAMP HERE
GBgFH6pd22Q_9 THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT THE ORIGINAL INPUT OF LOOK LIKE
GBgFH6pd22Q_10 SO THERE'S TWO CENTER WAKES THAT YOU PULL UP HERE AND THAT WOULD BURN YOUR FLUID
GBgFH6pd22Q_11 SO WE'LL PUT THAT BACK IN
GBgFH6pd22Q_12 BUT THAT'S FOOT UP THAT LOOK LIKE ON A FIXED GLOW
GBgFH6pd22Q_13 AND IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE ONE NEXT TO IT
GBgFH6pd22Q_14 THIS LANTERN IS THE SAME THE SAME ON THE TYPE OF APPARATUS WHERE THE IT'S FIXED UNDERNEATH
GBgFH6pd22Q_15 AND USUALLY THE BOTTOM WHERE IT HAS TWO PIECES THAT YOU PUT TOGETHER THE SPRING FORM AND PULL IT OUT AND THERE'S YOUR FIX QUOTE
GBgFH6pd22Q_16 ANOTHER SIMILAR BURNER ON THE TOP BUT ALSO THIS ONE IS BRASS WITH TWO SMALL BURNERS IN AN ON AND WHAT COMES OUT OF THOSE IS THE WICK WHICH IS ON SATURATED FROM THE FUEL UNDERNEATH IN THE BURNER
GBgFH6pd22Q_17 SO THAT SLIDES BACK UP INTO THE LOW FIFTH AND ATTACHES SO THAT YOU CAN BE CARRIED IN HANDLED IN A FEW WALKING SO THESE WERE GREAT FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE PLEASE MEN WALKING A STREET THAT NINE AROUND THEIR OWN STAGE IN OR ON THE CORNERS OF A ON HOW WHAT STREET AT NIGHT WHEN IT WAS A NEW AT LIGHTING
GBgFH6pd22Q_18 THESE ARE GREAT TO USE WHEN YOU WALK AROUND TOWN
GBgFH6pd22Q_19 I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH LIGHT YOU GOT FROM THEM BUT THEY WERE THAT'S THAT WAS THERE LIGHT SOURCE ENOUGH MIDI NINETEENTH CENTURY
hi4TMDAaGw8_1 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR THE ADHD ADULTS
hi4TMDAaGw8_2 I'LL START BY A TALKING ABOUT PRESCRIPTION OPTIONS JUST BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST WELL KNOWN TO PEOPLE
hi4TMDAaGw8_3 IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR PEOPLE OF MY GENERATION TO HAVE GROWN UP WITH A NUMBER OF CLASSMATES WHO WERE ON RITALIN
hi4TMDAaGw8_4 I HAPPEN TO COME FROM THE PART OF THE COUNTRY YOU THAT HAVE THE MOST KIDS ON RITALIN DURING THE EIGHTIES
hi4TMDAaGw8_5 AND IT WAS A SORT OF THING WHERE YOU COULD SEE FOR SOME KIDS ARE WAS VERY EFFECTIVE
hi4TMDAaGw8_6 ESPECIALLY IF YOU SAW THEM BEFORE THEY EVER THEY OVER TO THE MEDICATION
hi4TMDAaGw8_7 AND THESE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO ADULTS AS WELL
hi4TMDAaGw8_8 AS I MENTIONED RITALIN WHICH IS A GENERICALLY KNOWN AS THE PLANET DATE CAN BE A CRIME METHOD OF TREATMENT
hi4TMDAaGw8_9 A CONCERT IT WOULD BE ANOTHER ONE ACTING FORM OF MATH AND A DAY
hi4TMDAaGw8_10 AND IT'S A STIMULANT
hi4TMDAaGw8_11 IT CAUSES ACTIVITY TO INCREASING PREFRONTAL CORTEX WHICH INSTEAD OF BEING STIMULATING IN DISTRACTING FOR SOMEBODY WITH ADHD IS ACTUALLY A CALMING IN FOCUSING THING
hi4TMDAaGw8_12 ADD A RAW WAS ANOTHER TREATMENT
hi4TMDAaGw8_13 AND THAT'S A COMBINATION OF AMPHETAMINE SOLE
hi4TMDAaGw8_14 OR ALL IS ALMOST MORE WELL KNOWN AS A DRUG OF ABUSE
hi4TMDAaGw8_15 WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE IT CAN BE PART OF AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR A DULL EIGHTY
hi4TMDAaGw8_16 G AND AGAIN IT'S ANOTHER STIMULANT WHICH INCREASES ACTIVITY AND PREFRONTAL CORTEX
hi4TMDAaGw8_17 ADHD ADULTS MASS OF BENEFIT FROM CERTAIN ANTIDEPRESSANTS THAT IT CAUSES DIFFERENT ACTIVITY WITHIN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX IN TERMS OF UP I DON'T MEAN THE DOUGH AND OPENING RE UP TAKES
hi4TMDAaGw8_18 SO THERE'S MORE DURABLE MEAN THAT YOU KNOW TRANSMITTER'S OF STICKING IN
hi4TMDAaGw8_19 THAT HAIR ON IS A NON STIMULANT OR NONTRADITIONAL STIMULANT OPTION
hi4TMDAaGw8_20 AND THAT INVOLVES INHIBITING DEBRIS UP TAKE OF NOR OFTEN NOR AKRON AFTER AND WHICH IS TEND TO BE HELPFUL IN ADULTS WITH ADHD
hi4TMDAaGw8_21 IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT IT FOR ADHD ADULT WHO HAS DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY ISSUES IT'S YOU HAVE THOSE CORK OR MORBIDITY IS PROPERLY TREATED
hi4TMDAaGw8_22 SUBSTANCE ABUSE FALLS INTO THIS TOO
hi4TMDAaGw8_23 OH AND WHY FOR SOME ADHD PATIENTS IS ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR DEPRESSION AND THEY'RE INSIDE THE INSIDE OF THE ANXIETY TO BE MANAGED
hi4TMDAaGw8_24 SO THEY CAN ELIMINATE THOSE FACTORS AS DISTRACTIONS INTRIGUING THEIR ADHD
hi4TMDAaGw8_25 AND HAVE AN OVERALL BETTER FEELING ABOUT THEMSELVES IN THE LIFE THING THE
hgZiIrxQPvk_1 IN THIS CLIP WE'LL LOOK AT A TECHNIQUE THAT WE CAN USE TO STIMULATE THE INTESTINES IN THE MOVEMENT OF THE PALM DIGESTION AND AN STIMULATING THE COLON
hgZiIrxQPvk_2 THE FAT ALONG WINTER WITH NOT MUCH ACTIVITY IMMEDIATELY DIET THINGS CAN GET SENTENCES WEIGHT REIKI THINGS MOVING
hgZiIrxQPvk_3 THIS WOULD BE COUNTER INDICATED IF THINGS ARE MOVING TO QUICKLY FIGURE DIGESTIVE TRACK FOR THE THINGS A NORMAL TO SLOW THEN YOU CAN USE THIS TECHNIQUE
hgZiIrxQPvk_4 BASICALLY THIS NEW YOGA BLOCK FOR AND USE THAT ON ANY SURFACE UNEVEN SURFACE A YOGA MAT HELPS
hgZiIrxQPvk_5 AND REPLACE THE LOCK WHEN IT'S TALL AND I'M IN THE AND I'M IN EITHER JUST ABOUT THE PUBIC BONE OR JUST BELOW THE RIBS AND YOU CAN DO IN BOTH PLACES
hgZiIrxQPvk_6 AND WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL PUT THE EDGE OF THE BLOCK ON THE FLOOR AND WILL USE OUR BODY WEIGHT AND LAY ON THE BLOCK PRODUCE OF HURTING YOURSELF WITH YOUR ARMS
hgZiIrxQPvk_7 AND YOU FEEL SOME PRESSURE
hgZiIrxQPvk_8 AND WE'LL JUST ONE AND BREATHE INTO THE BLOCK AND TAKE YOUR TIME TO RELAX INTO THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY LAYING OVER THE BLOCK
hgZiIrxQPvk_9 YOU CAN SEE IT AT AN ANGLE
hgZiIrxQPvk_10 MY TO CONTROL THAT ANGLE AND WITHIN MY WEIGHT FORWARD <UNK> EVEN MORE FORCE WOULD ANGLES THE OTHER DIRECTION
hgZiIrxQPvk_11 AND ULTIMATELY DOES WHEN I'M IT HAD RELAX HOW IT AND THAT THE BODY MOVEMENTS HOUGH EMLA TO PUSH SHOULDN'T DO GOOD
hgZiIrxQPvk_12 THIS IS ALSO A GREAT WAY TO SOFTEN THE TISSUES OF THE ABDOMEN
hgZiIrxQPvk_13 A LOT OF TENSION ALL THE SOFT TISSUES OF THE ORGANS IN SO FROM IF YOU HAVE HARDNESS FOR STIFFNESS ARE FEELING OF CONGEST JEN IN THIS PART OF THE BODY THIS HELPS TO JUST SOFTEN AREA WHETHER YOU NEED HELP WITH DIGESTION ELIMINATION INDUSTRY TO RELAX THERE

h8yFlNScCIQ_2 WELL I'M HUNDRED PSI YOU ON HOW YOU CAN PREVENT INTO FAKE UNTIL YOU SEE YOUR GENERAL DENTIST
h8yFlNScCIQ_3 KNEES MICHELLE AND I'M A DENTAL ASSISTANT WITH SOLUTIONS
h8yFlNScCIQ_4 AND MAINLY A COUPLE OF OF THE REASONS AS FAR AS HOW TO PREVENT TO FAKE ON UNTIL YOU CAN SEE YOUR GENERAL DENTIST IS YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND PERCHES KNEE KNEE SOME OVER THE COUNTER OR OLD NUMBING MEDICINE AND SUCH AS OR JOE
h8yFlNScCIQ_5 WELL WHAT THAT WILL DO IS YOU JUST PLACE THE GEL ON YOUR GUMS AND ON THE TOOTH AREA WHERE YOU'RE HAVING ACHE FROM
h8yFlNScCIQ_6 AT ONE NUMB THAT IS THAT AREA FOR A FEW MINUTES THEM ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE MINUTES AND THEN WHEN YOU WANT TO KEEP REAPPLYING THROUGHOUT THE DAY
h8yFlNScCIQ_7 YOU ALSO MIGHT WANT TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE A THUMB OVER THE COUNTER MEDICATION AS FAR AS LIKE HOW NOT ADVIL IBUPROFEN IN
h8yFlNScCIQ_8 I'VE ALREADY COVERED IT'S BEST BECAUSE IT HAS AN ANTI INFLAMMATORY AND IT WILL WHICH WILL HELP WITH ANY INFLAMMATION THAT MIGHT HAVE IN THAT AREA
h8yFlNScCIQ_9 THAT UNTIL YOU CAN SEE YOUR GENERAL DENTIST OF THE THINGS YOU WANT TO DO THE DEFTLY DO ONE AND GO SEE YOUR DENTIST AFTERWARDS SO THEREFORE HE WOULD BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF TO FIGURE HAVE BEING IF IT'S IT COME PROBLEM OR HAS THE ACTUAL TOOTH PROBLEM AND HE WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF IT FROM THERE
h8yFlNScCIQ_10 ONCE AGAIN MY NAME'S MICHELLE AND I JUST EXPLAINED TO YOU ON HOW TO PREVENT TO FAKE UNTIL YOU SEE YOUR GENERAL DENTIST
gPnoD1ZRhnE_1 SO THE NEXT OPTION IS ON FOR PAPERS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IN A SPECIFIC COLOR THAT YOU'RE FLIPPING THE MAGAZINE CAN FINDER LOOKING AND PAPER STORING CAN'T FIND IS TO PAINT THE PAPER YOURSELF
gPnoD1ZRhnE_2 ON THE BAT FACTS OF PAPER TO USE FOR THESE ARE THE THICKER STOCK PAPERS AGAIN BECAUSE YOU'RE WORKING WITH A WET SURFACE
gPnoD1ZRhnE_3 YOU WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IF THE TYPE OF PAPER THAT IF IT WON'T ON BUCKLE WON'T FALL APART ONION ESPECIALLY THIN PAPERS I'M DRAWING PAPERS FROM A DRAWING PAD USUALLY OR A LITTLE TOO THIN FOR DOING THIS TYPE OF ON PAINTING ON
gPnoD1ZRhnE_4 SO AS YOU CAN SEE HERE IT SORT OF HAVE CREATED OF ARRAY OF COLORS FOR MYSELF
gPnoD1ZRhnE_5 IT ALSO DONE ON THE OTHER PAIN THINGS THAT I'VE DECIDED THAT I WASN'T TO FIND OTHER THE PAINTING AS A WHOLE ON PAPERS AND I'VE CUT OUT DIFFERENT PIECES ARE RIPPED OUT DIFFERENT PIECES IN SHAKES ON SO THAT I CAN USE PAPER THAT I'VE PAINTED ON MYSELF
gPnoD1ZRhnE_6 SO AGAIN YOU HAVE ALL TYPES OF OPTIONS WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH PAINTING YOUR OWN PAPER
gPnoD1ZRhnE_7 BUT THEN YOU HAVE THE EYE CHOICE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE COLORS THAT YOU'D LIKE AND THE COLORS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

g5g75qxynPg_3 IT SAYS YOU CAN FOR POSSIBLY SEE WITH THIS PRODUCT FROM IT DOESN'T HAVE A TENDENCY TO RAISE THE GRAIN AS MUCH AS THE OIL BASED STAIN ANTA'S AND IN THIS CASE I DIDN'T CONDITION THE WOOD AT ALL
g5g75qxynPg_4 SO ON THIS GOING STRAIGHT ON TO THE LIVE WITH THE STAIN
g5g75qxynPg_5 AND DUFF YOU COULD POSSIBLY SEE THAT THE THE COLOR STAYS PRETTY CONSISTENT

GcpnJMAZmXo_1 I HAVE MANY <UNK> SORENSEN WHEN THE QUESTION PROGRAM MANAGER HERE THE NATIONAL ABILITY CENTER
GcpnJMAZmXo_2 THIS SADDLE WE CALL OUR NEOPRENE SADDLE ON IT'S AN ADAPTIVE SADDLE THAT WE USE FOR A LOT RIDERS WHO NEED A LITTLE ON LAB HAVE A LITTLE LESS MOBILITY MAYBE
GcpnJMAZmXo_3 SO RIDER WAS IN WHEELCHAIR LEGIBLE PALSY WHO HAS THE MUSCLES IN THE LEGS
GcpnJMAZmXo_4 THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO START BECAUSE THEY CAN UTILIZE THE SUPPORT OF SIDE WALKERS EASIER AS WELL AS THEIR LEGS DON'T HAVE TO BE IN THE DOWN POSITION TO BE ABLE TO RIDE
GcpnJMAZmXo_5 THEIR LEGS CAN BE A LITTLE HIGHER UP BECAUSE THE LEGS ARE TIGER
GcpnJMAZmXo_6 AND IT'S ALSO COMFORTABLE ON IT'S GOING TO HELP WITH ANY TYPE OF SKIN SKIN BREAKDOWN ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT'S MORE ACCOUNTABLE SADDLE
GcpnJMAZmXo_7 IT ALSO ALLOWS THE RIDER TO FILL THE HORSE MARKET CLOSER TO THE HORSE
GcpnJMAZmXo_8 THE HEAT OF THE HORSE CAN COME UP THROUGH THE SADDLE TO HELP RELAX MUSCLES THAT ARE TIGHT ON
GcpnJMAZmXo_9 AND THE HANDLE YEAR TO HELP AGAIN FOR SAFETY THE RIDER CAN HOLD ON
GcpnJMAZmXo_10 THERE ARE STARTS THAT CAN BE ATTACHED TO THIS OR THAT OR CAN BE WRITTEN WITHOUT STARTS ON IN THIS GENERALLY SITS MOST OF THE HORSES BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE A SOLID TREE AND DIRTY
hA9iUP60YOQ_1 AND THIS POINT IN HIS CAN DO THE SAME THING THAT I WAS DOING ON THE UPPER LIP ON THE LOWER IT LOWER LIP AREA AND ON THE CHIN TRYING REFINE AND A LITTLE BIT BETTER
hA9iUP60YOQ_2 ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE DEFINITION AS TO WHERE THOSE THINGS ARE
hA9iUP60YOQ_3 YOU CAN SEE RIGHT NOW IT'S KIND OF GENERIC HAVE GOOD AS WE'VE BEEN RUNNING HEAT
hA9iUP60YOQ_4 ON GET PRETTY GENERIC AS TO WHAT THE SHAPE OF THAT LOWER LIP IS ONE REFINED THAT BY LEAVING THE OUT THE LIP ITSELF ALONG IN CARVING TRULY IT IN THAT AREA UNDER THE LIMIT
hA9iUP60YOQ_5 SO WHAT I SHADING HERE THAT I CAN ESTABLISH A HARD IT BETWEEN THOSE TWO SERVICES THAT WILL TO FIND THE SHAPE OF THE BOTTOM LIT
hA9iUP60YOQ_6 MORE CLEARLY AND DONE BEFORE
hA9iUP60YOQ_7 NOW YOU NOTICE THAT WHAT WILL GO WHAT WE'RE ULTIMATELY DOING IS WE'RE MAKING THAT CHIN THE BOTTOM PART OF THE CHIN STICK OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN WE MAY WANT TO HONE BUT THAT'S OKAY
hA9iUP60YOQ_8 WE'LL COME BACK IN AND REMOVE THE CHIN HAS THE NEXT PART OF THIS
hA9iUP60YOQ_9 <UNK> AND WE'RE JUST CONCENTRATING ON GETTING THAT LOWER LIP FIND MORE CLEARLY
hA9iUP60YOQ_10 MAN YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT LOW A MUCH MORE ACCURATE AND IT WAS
hA9iUP60YOQ_11 AND THE END OF THE LIP IS CLEAR
gyRlgBAT2Lc_1 NOW WE HAVE THEM DETERMINED BY THE UP BY HAVING TAKING MEASUREMENT FOR THAT THE THAT THE DEPTH OF THE NUT SLOTS ARE ARE ARE GOOD BECAUSE THE THIS STRINGS ARE SITTING AT A AT A DECENT HEIGHT ABOVE THE FRETS
gyRlgBAT2Lc_2 AND WE HAVE NO VASES HERE ON THE FIRST FRET
gyRlgBAT2Lc_3 THAT MEASUREMENT HOLE JUST FOR YOUR OWN INTEREST OR A IS OF THE BAND OUT THE OVER TO HUNDREDS OF AN INCH ON TOP OF LOVE THIS FRETBOARD ON AN THAT NUMBER IS VARIABLE ODD DEPENDING UPON THE HEIGHT OF THE FRETS THEMSELVES
gyRlgBAT2Lc_4 BUT IT WORKS ON THIS PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT IT'S A GOOD GOOD HEIGHT
gyRlgBAT2Lc_5 BUT WHAT WE'VE DETERMINED WAS THAT THE FRONT AND THE THAN NOT ITSELF WAS TOO HIGH BECAUSE THIS THE STRINGS ARE SITTING TO DEEPLY INTO THAT NOT IT'S INTO THOSE KNOTS LOTS AND THAT CAN CAUSE BINDING
gyRlgBAT2Lc_6 WHAT WE CAN REALLY WOULD LIKE TO DO IS HAVE CANNOT OF OF STRINGS SIT ABOUT HALFWAY DOWN THE KNOTS OUT
gyRlgBAT2Lc_7 SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO THREE NEEDED TAKE DOWN SOME OF THE TOP OF AND NOT SO THE STRINGS DON'T HAVE TO SIT SO TIGHTLY IN MOVES IN THOSE LOCKS

gkyD3XAO78k_4 SO IF THE WATER LEVEL IN THE PHASE DROPS THE THESE WITH THE STEMS OFF THE STEMS AGAIN A SEAL UP
gkyD3XAO78k_5 SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IN THAT CASE IS TAKE THE STEM OUT OF THE DAYS AND GIVE IT ANOTHER FRESH CUT SO THAT ARE OPENING UP THE BASE OF THE STEM AGAIN AND IT'S TRICK OF WATER INTO
gkyD3XAO78k_6 THE FLOOR PRESERVATIVES IS GOOD BECAUSE IT HELPS KEEP THE WATER CLEAN BUT AS LONG AS YOU'RE ADDING WATER IN AN DUMPING OUT THE DIRTY WATER
gkyD3XAO78k_7 THEN YOU KNOW THAT'S THE BEST THING FOR THE FLOWERS
gkyD3XAO78k_8 THE BLEACH IS PRETTY GOOD BUT NEEDLE TOO MUCH BLEACH WITH TENDED DISCOLOR FLOWERS SO YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT
gkyD3XAO78k_9 AGAIN UP A LITTLE BIT OF THE PRESERVATIVES GUIDE BUT NOT TOO MUCH
gkyD3XAO78k_10 AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A FRESH CUT FRESH WATER

g6vQ_WYVSk0_1 OKAY TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT KEEPING YOUR GOATS HEALTHY IN REFERENCE TO OUT INTESTINAL PARASITES
g6vQ_WYVSk0_2 NOW IT'S NOT A REAL PLEASANT TOPIC BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE IF YOU GOTTA KEEP COATS
g6vQ_WYVSk0_3 GOATS DO GET WORMS
g6vQ_WYVSk0_4 IN FACT THEY ALL HAVE THEM
g6vQ_WYVSk0_5 IT'S NOT A MATTER OF OF AN ELIMINATING WORM SO MUCH AS IT IS TO MANAGE THE LOAD
g6vQ_WYVSk0_6 SOME PEOPLE DO THEIR OWN HOME FECAL TESTS WITH A MICROSCOPE AND EXAMINE THE OF THE FECES FOR WORM LARVA TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH SHOW HIM HOW MUCH SHOW LOAD THEY HAVE
g6vQ_WYVSk0_7 HOWEVER IF YOU'RE AROUND YOU GOATS AND IF YOU WATCH THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF ALL YOU CAN GENERALLY TOWEL
g6vQ_WYVSk0_8 SOME OF THE SIGNS OF LOVE PARASITES ALL I'VE IF THEY GET A LIGHTENING OF THE GUMS IN THE LIGHTS OF THE EYES AND THEY START TO LOOK ANEMIC CAN THEY MIGHT ACT SICK
g6vQ_WYVSk0_9 YOU MIGHT SEE DIARRHEA OUR OUT OF OUR OTHER ASSIGNS THAT THEY'RE JUST NOT QUITE RIGHT
g6vQ_WYVSk0_10 OF THE MAIN PREVENTION FOR WORMS IS TO ROTATE YOUR PASTURES BECAUSE THE OF LIFE CYCLE OF WORMS SUCH THAT FEET LARVA THEY COME OUT IN THE STOOL
g6vQ_WYVSk0_11 THE LARVA HATCH OUT THEY AB A CATCH OUT IN THE GROOVE OF GROW
g6vQ_WYVSk0_12 THEY CLIMB UP ONTO THE WEEDS IN GRASS AND THEN THE GOATS THREE INGEST THEM OF AN END UP GETTING INFECTED
g6vQ_WYVSk0_13 DO SEVERAL WAYS IF YOU HAVE A SERIES WORM PROBLEM THAT YOU CAN TREAT THEM WE ADD THE LEATHER WITH INJECTABLE MEDICINE IN OR A PASTE THAT'S GIVEN TO THEM OR OLLIE
g6vQ_WYVSk0_14 AND ON YOU MIGHT CHOOSE IS A TIME TO DO THAT RIGHT BEFORE THEY GO ON PASTURE OR RIGHT AFTER THE FROST
g6vQ_WYVSk0_15 ALSO WILD IF YOU'VE TREATED YOUR WORMS WITH WERE MEDICINE YOU CAN DRINK THE MILK OR EIGHT TO MEET FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DAYS
g6vQ_WYVSk0_16 SO IT MIGHT BE WISE TO WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE DRIED OFF OR A GOOD LATE IN PREGNANCY TO DO THE WORMING

gomI_utk5YM_2 OPEN CHORDS BASICALLY TALKS ABOUT FIRST POSITION CHORDS WHICH IS WITHIN THE FIRST THREE FRETS AND THEY'RE CALLED OPEN CHORD BECAUSE YOU'RE UTILIZING OPEN STRINGS IN ALL OF THESE CHORDS
gomI_utk5YM_3 AND THAT OPEN STRINGS MAIN SIMPLY PLAYING THEM HANGING OVER THEM

g-VDa76uTYQ_1 I'M KARINA FRALEY FOR EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LITTLE LEAGUE
g-VDa76uTYQ_2 ONCE YOU'RE IN ROLLED YOUR CHILD'S AND I'M AND HAVE DETERMINED WHERE CHILD'S CAN APPLY THE REALLY MEANS IS THAT YOUR CHILD DOWN AND EXPLAIN TO THEM ABOUT THE HISTORY OF LITTLE LEAGUE AN AND THE MISSION STATEMENT THAT IT REALLY IS TO ENCOURAGE SPORTSMANSHIP AND A SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND TO CREATE REALLY GREAT AND POSITIVE MEMORIES
g-VDa76uTYQ_3 WHEN THEY GO ON THAT FIELDS AND AGAIN THE ONE WHERE THE UNIFORM PROBABLY AND THEY'RE GOING TO WANT A REALLY DO RIGHT BY THE HISTORY OF LITTLE LEAGUE
g-VDa76uTYQ_4 HE WANTED TEACH THEM THAT THEY'RE NOT THAT CAUSE FIGHTS OR CALL NAMES OR MAKE FUN OF ANY OTHER PLAYER OR ANY OTHER TEAM
g-VDa76uTYQ_5 THEY HAVE TO BE GRACIOUS WINNERS AS WELL AS GRACIOUS LOSERS
g-VDa76uTYQ_6 LITTLE LEAGUE CAN BE A LOT OF FINE BUT AS EVERYTHING ELSE YOU HAVE TO TEACH A CHILD TO SOME BASIC GUIDELINES IN RULES OF AT OF SOMETHING THAT CAN BECOME COMPETITIVE DOESN'T BE CALM AND NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE FOR THEM
H0QQv5UrmNQ_2 IT IS TRUE THAT DOGS ARE DERIVATIVE FROM GRAY WOLFS AND ARE PACKING ANIMALS
H0QQv5UrmNQ_3 IN MY OPINION DOGS NEED FOUR TO TEN PLAYMATES NOT FORTY
H0QQv5UrmNQ_4 OFTENTIMES CUSTOMERS CALL ME AND WE'LL TRY TO TALK TO ME FOR AN HOUR OF WHY THEY THINK EVERY DOG SHOULD BE TAKEN TO A DOG PARK
H0QQv5UrmNQ_5 HI POLITELY LET THEM KNOW THAT FROM MY EXPERIENCE AND THE REASON I STARTED MY COMPANY WAS BECAUSE EYEWITNESS TIME AND TIME AGAIN ON HEALTHY ON TRAIN DOGS IN DOG PARKS
H0QQv5UrmNQ_6 I ALSO FIND THAT FOR CLEANLINESS AND HEALTH DOG PARKS MORE TIME THAN NOT ARE NOT KEPT UP TO A CLEANLY STANDARD THAT I UPHOLD WITH MY PETS
H0QQv5UrmNQ_7 EVEN IF YOUR DOG HAS HAD SHOTS IN IS HEALTHY AND THERE'S A CHANCE AT A DOG PARK THEY COULD PICK UP A TO Z IS OR GET IN A IF HE ALTER KAISHA WITH A DOG RESULTING IN A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE THAT COULD AFFECT THE TRAINING AND ALL THE TIME YOU'VE PUT INTO YOUR DOG
H0QQv5UrmNQ_8 SO MY OPINION IF YOU GO TO A DOG PARK BE VERY AWARE WHAT OTHER DOGS ARE THERE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE THERE AND PEOPLE CLOSE EYE ON THE DOG INTERACTION TO MAKE SURE IT'S A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE
H0QQv5UrmNQ_9 MY A MY RECOMMENDATION LIKE I SAID IS HAVING FRIENDS AND FAMILY WITH JUST THREE TO FIVE DOGS THAT YOUR DOGS CAN OF PLAY DATES WITH WEEKLY TO STILL GET IMPROPERLY SOCIALIZED
heRDkIYxyDs_1 OKAY NOW THAT EVEN PROGRAMS MADE WINDOWS TWO THOUSAND RUN ON VISTA
heRDkIYxyDs_2 HI I'M DAN AFONSO OF AFONSO CONSULTING AND FLIGHTY AND THIS IS HOW TO RUN OLD PROGRAMS INVEST
heRDkIYxyDs_3 NOW THIS THE HANDLES A LOT OF THE COMPACT COMPATIBILITY WORK BEHIND THE SCENES
heRDkIYxyDs_4 NEVER GET A C AND IT JUST KIND OF WORKS WITH OR ANY PROBLEMS WHEN THE PROGRAM KNEES VERY SPECIFIC FEATURES VERY SPECIFIC OPERATING SYSTEMS WORE REQUIRED ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION
heRDkIYxyDs_5 ON A GOOD EXAMPLE THIS IS MOST VIDEO GAMES GENERALLY ASSUME THAT THEY HAVE FULL RANGE OF THE MACHINE GINLEY THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY I'M BAD ASSUMPTION BUT IT IS ANNOYING IN VISTA BECAUSE THIS INSTEAD OF SIMPLY ALLOWING THIS WILL TYPICALLY POPPELL WARNINGS SO IN ORDER TO TRY IT OUT FIRST THING WHEN BRING UP SOMETHING
heRDkIYxyDs_6 I AM GOING TO ROOMS BREVE A GAME HERE AND IT AND IF YOU JUST WANT A C THAT AGAIN THAT WAS WORKING OR ANY PROGRAM REALLY WAS WORKING BEFORE TRIED OUTS RIGHT CLICK ON IT AND WE'RE AS ADMINISTRATOR ON THE SAME ASSUMING YOU HAVE FULL CONTROL A MACHINE AN ADMINISTRATOR PASS
heRDkIYxyDs_7 WE WANT IT LIKE THIS IT WILL THEN DON'T LEAN IN RUN UNDER FOLD PRIVILEGE MELT THAT FIXES THE ISSUE WITH YOU NOW ME TO DO IS TO RIGHT CLICK ON IT CLICK ON PROPERTIES GO OVER THE COMPATIBILITY AND RUN AND CHECK OUT FROM THIS PROGRAM AS ADMINISTRATOR
heRDkIYxyDs_8 THIS WILL ALWAYS MAKE IT STARTED BY DEFAULT AS AN ADMINISTRATOR
heRDkIYxyDs_9 AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS WHEN YOU DO IT IT WILL POP UP A WARNING EVERY TIME YOU TRY TO START THE APPLICATION
heRDkIYxyDs_10 ANOTHER OPTION YOU HAVE THESE IF IT REQUIRES CERTAIN FEATURES BLOGS SO OR CORKS OF OF CERTAIN OPERATING SYSTEM THERE'S AN OPTION UNDER MOST OF THESE UNDER COMPATIBILITY TO RUN IT IN COMPATIBILITY KNOWN FOR WHATEVER APPLICATION YOU WANT
heRDkIYxyDs_11 YOU CAN EVEN GO BACK AS FAR AS AN TEETH FOUR POINT OIL AS YOUR FROM FOR AS YOUR COMPATIBILITY VERSION ALLOWING YOU TO GET SOME REALLY OLD CRANKY APPLICATIONS THE RUN UNDER VEST
heRDkIYxyDs_12 I'M DAN AFONSO AND THIS HAS BEEN HOW TO RUN OLDER APPLICATIONS UNDER VISTA
HcXTE9nwihA_1 THAT'S THE ARE TALK ABOUT IS THE PROPER LIGHTING IN HEATING FOR CRESTED GECKO
HcXTE9nwihA_2 CRESCENT GECKOS ARE TROPICAL SPECIES OF THE BODY IS AS MUCH HEATING AS SAIL A DESERT SPECIES DOES BUT A LITTLE BIT HE MIGHT STUBBORNNESS OR DEPENDING ON YOUR HOME
HcXTE9nwihA_3 KNEE TO KICK THE KEEP THE GECKO IT ANYWHERE BETWEEN SEVENTY TO SEVENTY FIVE DEGREES TEMPERATURE
HcXTE9nwihA_4 THE MIDDLE OF A HIGHER BUT DON'T GO TOO MUCH MORE THAN EIGHTY FIVE UNEASE ANY STRICT IMAGINATION
HcXTE9nwihA_5 OF SOLD THOUGHT IN CASE A SIMPLE HEAT FIXTURE JUST LIKE THIS A LAMP WITH A CERAMIC TOP OR THEY SHOULD HAVE A CERAMIC TOP AN EIGHT TWENTY FIVE OR FIFTY WATT BALD USUALLY SEVENTY FIVE TOPS WILL DO USE FAR'S HEATING GOES
HcXTE9nwihA_6 AGAIN NOT LOOKING FOR A SUPER HIGH TEMPERATURES OR KEEP THE CAGE OR CONSTANCE SLIGHTLY WARM TEMPERATURE JUST ABOVE AND PROBABLY KEEPER HOW SET
HcXTE9nwihA_7 ON THE O THEY NEED TO THINK ABOUT ALSO IS THE UVB LIGHT
HcXTE9nwihA_8 UVB LIGHT IS COMES FROM FLUORESCENT FIXTURES EITHER COMPACT OR THE GOOD OLD TUBE FIXTURE WHAT THAT DOES THE UVB GIVES THE ANIMAL UVB LIGHT WHICH HE NEEDS TO CREATE VITAMIN D THREE HIS BODY AND MOVE CALCIUM IN THE BONE STRUCTURE
HcXTE9nwihA_9 IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THING TO HAVE ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG ANIMALS AS A GROWING IN THE NEEDLE LIKE ALL THE CALCIUM MAKING GET
HcXTE9nwihA_10 THIS WILL PROBABLY ABOUT A PROP A LOT OF HEAT BUT IT COULD IF YOU'RE KEEPING A HOUSE IN THE SEVENTY TO WHERE YOU RE AREA READY TO PUT ONE OF THESE IS PROBABLY ENOUGH HEAT OR CRESCENT GECKO NICE AND HAPPY
HcXTE9nwihA_11 WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR A CRESTED GECKO A CAKE CAGE IS NOT AS A HIGH HEATS BUT YOU WANT A HIGH HUMIDITY
HcXTE9nwihA_12 YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO KEEP THE ODD THE HUMIDITY UP IN THE HEAT TO AROUND SEVENTY TO SEVENTY FIVE

GV8RcNRQUVI_4 A PAIR OF SCISSORS SOME ACCENT PENS AND A LITTLE BIT OF DOUBLE STICK TAPE WORE A DAB OF GLUE
GV8RcNRQUVI_5 THIS IS GOING TO BE A QUARTER FOLD CURRENT
GV8RcNRQUVI_6 SO WE'LL START BY A MATCHING ON CORNER IS EXACTLY IN ONE WHOLE THOSE ONE IS EXACTLY TOGETHER
GV8RcNRQUVI_7 HOLD THAT AND THEN IF I'M CREASE THE CENTER
GV8RcNRQUVI_8 THE CREASES CENTER AND THEN TURN IT AND THE FLEETS OVER TO THE SIGN
GV8RcNRQUVI_9 HOLD THE CORNERS TOGETHER AND HOLD FIRMLY AND THEN INCREASE THE CURRENT LIKE THIS
GV8RcNRQUVI_10 NOW WE'RE GOING TO OPEN IT UP WITH AND FOLD IT FOR THE LONG LENGTH IF LIKE FENCE
GV8RcNRQUVI_11 SO FIRST TO MAKE THE MOUTH OF THE FAR
GV8RcNRQUVI_12 WE'RE GONNA MAKE EIGHT CRACKS ABOUT AN INCH AND A HALF AN
GV8RcNRQUVI_13 YOU CAN MEASURED IF YOU LIKE OR YOU CAN JUST GETS
GV8RcNRQUVI_14 IT'S NOT ON SOME PARTICULARLY THE EXACTLY IN ENGINE HALF
GV8RcNRQUVI_15 YOU CAN MAKE YOUR FRAUD ANY SIZE YOU WANT
GV8RcNRQUVI_16 THEN YOU'RE GOING TO FOLD BACK THE CORNER OPEN THAT NOW
GV8RcNRQUVI_18 FOLD OUT THE OTHER SIDE LIKE SO INCREASE THAT WELL
GV8RcNRQUVI_19 SO NOW YOU HAVE WHAT LOOKS LIKE BELLS
GV8RcNRQUVI_20 AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AND ONE MORE CUT BUSINESS FOR THE EYE AND WE'LL CUT ON TOP
GV8RcNRQUVI_22 YOU'RE GOING TO CUT IN ABOUT HALF AN INCH RIGHT FROM THE MIDDLE OF THAT FOLDED AREA HEAVY TOWARDS THE CORNER OF THE FOLD
GV8RcNRQUVI_23 AND YOU JUST SNIP RIGHT LIKE THAT
GV8RcNRQUVI_24 THEN WE'RE GOING TO FOLD THAT HIS BACK
GV8RcNRQUVI_25 JUST LIKE WE DIDN'T IF THE OTHER ONE BUT IT'S A LOT SMALLER
GV8RcNRQUVI_26 AMP

GZl_mP67NsA_3 WE'RE ON YOU ONE AND MAKE SURE YOU CAN HAVE A SITE WINE WITH THE ACCOMPANIST
GZl_mP67NsA_4 IT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT OF SIGHT LINE WITH THE PAY SURE COULD REALLY ALL THEIR MAIN JOB THIS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TRAIN PAGES TO THE CANNAS CAN KEEP PLAYING ON A STRAIGHT THROUGH WITH YOU
GZl_mP67NsA_5 SO REALLY POSITION YOURSELF ON RIGHT AFTER YOU TUNE FINDING A GOOD SPOT MAYBE RIGHT HERE I'M SCISSORS A LITTLE BIT OF AN ANGLE
GZl_mP67NsA_6 THIS SHOULD BE SOMEWHAT OF A LITTLE ANGLE BETWEEN YOU AND PIANOS
GZl_mP67NsA_7 SO YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO OUT TO A KITTEN THAT YOU'RE READY
GZl_mP67NsA_8 WHEN TO FOUNDER POSITION THEN YOU CAN SET UP YOUR VIOLIN UP AND GIVE HIM A SIGNAL
GZl_mP67NsA_9 AND DEPENDING WHAT PIECES PLANK SOME PIECES THERE'LL BE A PIANO INTRO OR SOME PIECES YOU START PLAYING WITH HIM
GZl_mP67NsA_10 IF THERE IS A PIANO INTRO ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS JUST THIS YOURSELF AND END IS GIVEN A SINGLE THAT YOU READY
GZl_mP67NsA_11 WE COULD NOT PLAIN BEING ONLY NEED IS WILL SIGNALED SILICON OR IT AGAIN
HBaiiL17ai0_1 SO A QUESTION THAT OFTEN COMES OUT REGARDED INJURY DO IS I AM I STOP WITH THAT JUST LET THAT ONE NOTE THAT ONE FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY
HBaiiL17ai0_2 AND THE ANSWER IS BASICALLY YES
HBaiiL17ai0_3 YOU PRETTY MUCH ARE
HBaiiL17ai0_4 THAT'S BASED ON THE LENGTH OF THIS TOO
HBaiiL17ai0_5 THAT'S THE WAY THE INSTRUMENT FUNCTIONS
HBaiiL17ai0_6 WITH THAT SAID THERE IS SOMETHING TO DO THAT KIND OF FOR SOME OTHER NOTES OUT OF IT
HBaiiL17ai0_7 ON THIS PARTICULAR DISH REDO WHICH IS BASICALLY A LOW V OF EVERYWHERE BEFORE ROOM ROOM
HBaiiL17ai0_8 WIDE BY PUSHING IT A LITTLE FASTER AND BY PUSHING MY LOWER LIP OUTWARD AGAIN CUT A FORCE IT UP ABOUT A HALF STEP
HBaiiL17ai0_9 WILL RUIN RUN IN ROOT AS ONE WAY TO GET A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PITCH OUT OF IT
HBaiiL17ai0_10 TO SERVICE THEN YOU CAN ALSO FORCE THE NOTE DOWN
HBaiiL17ai0_11 AH IS NOT HAVE THE SAME RESIDENT QUALITY IS THAT THAT FUNDAMENTALLY CATTLE LONG BUT IN THIS CASE AUGUST OVER THE FUNDAMENTAL ONE
HBaiiL17ai0_12 THEN BITE BY PUSHING THE CORNERS ONE MOUTH DOWN I CAN CUT OF MEAT OF NOTE BELOW THAT THAT BASIC FUNDAMENTAL WRONG ROOM WHOM RESUME
HBaiiL17ai0_13 THAT HAS A LOT OF PRACTICE
HBaiiL17ai0_14 THAT SOMETHING THAT I LEARNED OVER THE YEARS PLAIN TRUMPET NOSE ABLE APPLY IT TO THIS
HBaiiL17ai0_15 YOU ALSO FIND IT DOES REDUCED CUT INDIVIDUAL ISTHMUS WILL VARY THE LATIN THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT
HBaiiL17ai0_16 THIS PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT OF IS WHEN MY FAVORITES BECAUSE I CAN PUSH IT BOTH UP AND DOWN TOO LARGE EXAM
HBaiiL17ai0_17 IT WORKS PRETTY WELL
HBaiiL17ai0_18 SOME GOOD REDUCE EVERY LOCKED IN
HBaiiL17ai0_19 THEY DON'T SEEM TO DO THAT ALL
HBaiiL17ai0_20 IF YOU'RE A STUDENT DOESN'T SEE ONE OF THE THAT IT'S OKAY OF BUT IT IS ONE WAY TO GET SOME OTHER NOTES AT A GOOD REVIEW IT LEAVES A SLIGHT VARIATION ON JUST THAT ONE FUNDAMENTAL
HBaiiL17ai0_21 I'M RUIN ROOM ROOM SO THAT'S A LEASH EVEN GET US AND SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PITCHES AT AN INDIVIDUAL INSTRUMENT
HBaiiL17ai0_22 IF YOU REALLY NEED AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT KEY A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PATCH OF NOLLIE SOLUTION ON FORCEFULLY IS TO HAVE MULTIPLE DID REDUCE OF DIFFERENT KEYS
HBaiiL17ai0_23 IT CAN BE A LITTLE DECEIVING
HBaiiL17ai0_24 IN GENERAL THE PITCH OF THE A STRING IS DETERMINED BY ITS LENGTH BUT OF THE PHYSICS IN THE GEOMETRY THING TO BE A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT
HBaiiL17ai0_25 THE ONLY WAY THAT ARE REALLY DO NOW IS TO TRY THE INSTRUMENT OUT AND SEE WHAT KEEPS IT
HBaiiL17ai0_26 IF YOU SHOPPING FOR ONE ON LINE TYPICALLY ON WEBSITES I'VE SEEN IT'LL PUT THE KEY OF THAT IS FROM ITS A GOOD LEASE KNOW AT ITS ON WHAT IT IS
HBaiiL17ai0_27 THE GOOD EXAMPLE THE SUITED REVIEWS WHICH SEEM TO BE ABOUT THE SAME LENGTH UH ACTUALLY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCIES
HBaiiL17ai0_28 THIS ONE IS ROUGHLY IN HE RAN ROOM THAN THIS ONE IS CLOSER TO LOAD THE RIM PROBABLY ONE OF THE LEDGE IS BY LOOKING SO IF YOU'RE SHOPPING OF FOR DOES REDO THAT NEEDS TO BE A SPECIFIC KEY OR IN FOR THE TO GO IN PLAY IT TRY IT OUT AND WHAT IT IS THAT ARE GETTING
GILL9ysqWPQ_1 ALRIGHT NOW WE TAKE ISN'T TITANIUM WHITES REALLY IN BLUE SUMMER MEDIA
GILL9ysqWPQ_2 AND WE'RE INSERT MIXING THESE GUYS IS THIS GUYS CAN BE A VERY THIN LAYER IT'S ALSO CAN BE A VERY PALE LAYER
GILL9ysqWPQ_3 SO TAKE A PALLET KNIFE AND GRAB SOME BLUE PUT IT DOWN HERE
GILL9ysqWPQ_4 A REALLY NICE THICK CHOKE A WHITE
GILL9ysqWPQ_5 WITH THIS ONE TO DO IS TO KEEP MIXING IT'S CONSIDERED A VERY PALE BLUE
GILL9ysqWPQ_6 IMAGINE A C OF WHITE WITH DROP OF BLUE AND UP
GILL9ysqWPQ_7 AND ONCE YOU GET THIS VERY PILL BLUE TAKES LEVER MEDIA AND MIX IT IN TO FURTHER THING THIN IT OUT AND MAKE IT VERY EASY TO SPREAD THE CANVAS
GILL9ysqWPQ_8 IN THIS PIGMENT HERE IS GOING TO BE THE BEGINNING OF OUR SKY
GILL9ysqWPQ_9 TO TAKE YOUR BIGGEST FLATHEAD BRUSH AND APPLY A LOT OF THIS LIGHT BLUE TO IT
GILL9ysqWPQ_10 THAT IS UP ON TO THE CANVAS
GILL9ysqWPQ_11 APPLYING A SIDE MOTION WITH A LITTLE THIS LITTLE <UNK> SO MAKE SURE YOUR PIGMENT IS MAKING GOOD CONTACT WITH THE CANVAS
GILL9ysqWPQ_12 NOW RELATED TO THE CHARCOAL SOME IS PEOPLE WILL TREAT A CANVAS OR EVEN SLEIGH SEALANT BETWEEN THE CHARCOAL LAYER

GILL9ysqWPQ_16 WE WANT THAT LAYER TO BE FAITH BUT DEFINITELY PRESENT
GILL9ysqWPQ_17 THAT IS EXCEPT UP IN THIS REGION WHICH ARE THE LEAD AND THE SCHEDULE MORE OF A CLOUD EFFECT
GILL9ysqWPQ_18 BUT YOU FILL IN THE SIDE YOU ALSO FILL IN HOW THIS SIDE ENTIRELY WITH SKY THE SKY BLUE MIXTURE YOU DON'T
GI_l7c94yJY_2 THIS IS ALFRED ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GI_l7c94yJY_3 ALRIGHT WHICH SHOULD YOU USE
GI_l7c94yJY_4 CASH CREDITOR DEAD IT
GI_l7c94yJY_5 ONE OF THE EASIEST WAYS TO KEEP TRACK OF ARE SPENDING IS TO HAVE A CHECKING ACCOUNT
GI_l7c94yJY_6 THAT WAY WHEN YOU PAY FOR PURCHASE WITH CHECKS OR YOU'RE A GYM OR DEBIT CARD YOU ALREADY HAVE A RECORD OF THEM
GI_l7c94yJY_7 THEN YOU ONLY NEED TRACK A FEW EXPENSES THAT YOU PAY FOR IN CASH
GI_l7c94yJY_8 WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HAVING A CHECKING ACCOUNT YOU MIGHT ASK
GI_l7c94yJY_9 IT'S SAFE
GI_l7c94yJY_10 IT'S MUCH SAFER TO WRITE A CHECK THEN TO CARRY CASH
GI_l7c94yJY_11 IF FOR EXAMPLE YOU LOSE YOUR CHECKBOOK YOU CAN TELL THE BANK TO CANCEL YOU CHECKS AND NO ONE ELSE CAN SPEND MONEY
GI_l7c94yJY_12 IT'S CONVENIENT
GI_l7c94yJY_13 CHECKING ACCOUNTS ARE ALSO CONVENIENT FOR PAIN BILLS
GI_l7c94yJY_14 PAIN BY CHECK IS MUCH EASIER IN CHEAPER THAN BUYING A MONEY ORDER AND YOU'LL HAVE PROOF THAT YOU'VE PAY YOUR BILLS
GI_l7c94yJY_15 IN ADDITION TO WRITING CHECKS TO MAKE PURCHASES YOU CAN USE AN ATEMI DEBIT CARD AT ANY BANK MACHINE GROCERY STORE OR DRUG STORE TO MAKE A PURCHASE
GI_l7c94yJY_16 SOME BANKS ALSO OFFER ONLINE BANKING WHICH ALLOW YOU TO CHECK HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE IN YOUR COUNT AND PAY BILLS ONLINE
GI_l7c94yJY_17 CREDIT CARD CAN BE A GREAT TOOL WHEN USED PROPERLY
GI_l7c94yJY_18 MONTHLY STATEMENTS MAKE IT PRETTY EASY TO TRACK YOUR EXPENSES
GI_l7c94yJY_19 IT'S A BAD IDEA TO GET A CREDIT CARD OR LOAN WITHOUT HAVING A BUDGET OR SAVINGS ACCOUNT
GI_l7c94yJY_20 IF YOU LIKE THE CONCEPT OF A CREDIT CARD WITHOUT THE INTEREST IN A DEBIT CARD IS A VERY GOOD OPTION
GI_l7c94yJY_21 AND WHEN IT COMES TO CASH IT'S HARD TO SPEND WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE
GI_l7c94yJY_22 AS WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE ENVELOPE SYSTEM SO YOU DO TEND TO SAVE MORE MONEY
GI_l7c94yJY_23 THE DOWNSIDE OF USING CASH IS THAT IT TAKES A LOT MORE DISCIPLINE TO KEEP TRACK OF YOUR CASH PURCHASES

Ggi8J6RKHUA_1 HI I'M MARK MIDDLEBROOK AND I'M HERE IN THE PAUL MARCUS WINES CELLAR AND IN THIS SEGMENT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SPARKLING WINE PRODUCTION METHODS THAT AND SPECIFICALLY THE TWO MAIN METHODS THAT ARE USED IN THE MOST A SPARKLING WINES IN WORLD WITH THE COMPRESSION PAIN IN FRANCE IT LEADERS THEN UNITED STATES ANYWHERE ELSE
Ggi8J6RKHUA_2 THIS GENERALLY SIMPLER AND LESS EXPENSIVE METHOD IS CALLED THE BULK PROCESS OF THE SHOWER MOP METHOD NAMED AFTER THE FRENCH GUYTON DEVELOPED IT THE YEARS AGO
Ggi8J6RKHUA_3 ON THE IDEA IS YOU READY TO TAKE THE WINE AND YOU PUT IT INTO A LARGE THE VESSEL INTERESTING STEEL THESE DAYS AND THEN YOU IT'S ENTRY INJECT CARBON DIOXIDE INTO IT AND THAT'S HOW THE BUBBLES GET THERE
Ggi8J6RKHUA_4 IT'S VERY EFFICIENT DOES IN ONCE YOU'VE STILL TANK THERE
Ggi8J6RKHUA_5 ON AS ARE GOING TO MAKE A SPARKLING WINE IT'S IN A RELATIVELY MODEST IN COST OF INTENDED FIFTEEN TWENTY DOLLARS FOR A FOR A VENUE PRESSURE MARBLE METHOD ONE
Ggi8J6RKHUA_6 ONCE IN A B FRUITY WILL THAT SIMPLER LARGER BUBBLES EITHER PERFECTLY SATISFYING GREAT BRUNCH WINES GREAT FERNS STARTING OFF AN EVERYDAY DINNER
Ggi8J6RKHUA_7 AND I'D NOTHING ACTUALLY NOTHING WRONG WITH THE STOUT SPARKLING WINE OUT
Ggi8J6RKHUA_8 THE MORE INVOLVED IN CERTAIN MORE EXPENSIVE PROCESS IN TERMS OF THE OF THE EFFORT THIGH IS CALLED THE TYPICALLY CALL THEM THAT TOE JUMP AND WAS A CHAMPAGNE METHOD
Ggi8J6RKHUA_9 BECAUSE IT DOES THE PROPS AND THEN IN CHAMPAGNE AND LOVE ARGUMENT ABOUT THAT BUT IT CERTAINLY HAS REACHED IT'S EXACTLY THERE AND IT SAYS IS WHERE IT'S SPECIMEN
Ggi8J6RKHUA_10 IT'S ALSO CALLED A STEM LABELS NEKO TO BE SEEN NOW TRADITIONAL METHOD OR MATTED CLASSIC THE CLASSIC METHOD
Ggi8J6RKHUA_11 A ALL SYNONYMS FOR THE SAME BASIC PROCESS
Ggi8J6RKHUA_12 SO AGAIN NOW TO START BY MAKING MAKING WINE MAKING VERY MUCH ORDINARY WINE AND DOWN THEN INSTEAD OF PUTTING INTO A BIG VESSEL ON AFTER THE FERMENTATION IS COMPLETE THE ADD A LITTLE BIT OF RED YEAST INTO THE SUGAR AND THAT ACTIVATES WITH FOR THE SECONDARY FERMENTATION IN A BOTTLE
Ggi8J6RKHUA_13 LOOK AT IT OFTEN <UNK> OF AN THAT DO THIS ON BOUGHT
Ggi8J6RKHUA_14 SO IT'S A SECONDARY FERMENTATION IN THE BOTTLE THAT CREATES ABOUT BUBBLES BECAUSE OF NOWHERE FOR THEM THE BUBBLING STUFF THAT THE YEAST CREATES BY EATING SUGAR
Ggi8J6RKHUA_15 NOW WITH THAT NOTE NEWER FOR THAT TO GO SO IT IS DISSOLVED INTO THE WIND INCLUDES THE BUBBLES THAT YOU SEE A WHEN YOU TAKE IT
Ggi8J6RKHUA_16 JUMPING IS THE MOST FAMOUS A THAT I'M AT A JUMP AND WASN'T OF IT IS STILL LIFE BUT OF MANY THEIR MANY OTHER GOOD EXAMPLES FROM COBLEIGH FROM SPAIN AT CERTAIN SPARKLING WINES TONIGHT STATES
Ggi8J6RKHUA_17 AND IF YOU DIMENSION TASMANIA THIGH AND THAT EVEN IN ITALY IN THE FRONT COURT OF FOR EXAMPLE IN THE MEN'S METHOD IS IN THE LINES
Ggi8J6RKHUA_18 SO THESE AND BELOW MY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE AGAIN IS A LOT MORE EFFORT IN ALL TO TWO TO MAKE THE MAKE THE WIND IS WAY THE IT'LL THAT MORE ELEGANT LIFE TIME
Ggi8J6RKHUA_19 THESE IT IN GREAT EVERYDAY IN A SPARKLERS THAT YOU CAN USE TO TWO EVENT AND WE'RE STARTING ONE MORE OFTEN
gEA3qjf-3DM_1 AFTER YOU HAVE YOUR CLUB SINGLE THROW DOWN PRETTY CLEAN YOU CAN TAKE A CLUB IN EACH END AND THROW TO THE OTHER WITHOUT REALLY WEARING ABOUT WITH THIS GOES RIGHT SUPPOSED TO GO
gEA3qjf-3DM_2 YOU NEED TO PICK UP A SECOND TO START WORKING WITH TWO
gEA3qjf-3DM_3 WHEN CHARGER WITH CLUBS YOU CAN'T FORGET EVERYTHING YOU WERE AND WE USE OUR JIANG BALLS
gEA3qjf-3DM_4 ALL THE THROWS HAVE TO BE THE SAME HEIGHT AFTER GOING THE SAME RHYTHM TO SHOULD BE THROW THROW CATCH CATCH
gEA3qjf-3DM_5 GET THE HOLDER POSTURE PRETTIER AND YOU'D HAVE FEET SHOULDER WIDTH APART BENT ELBOWS STANDING IN NATURALLY WHEN YOU GO TO MAKE SURE TO FLOWING FROM THE OLDER WHO THAT COMES ACROSS LIKE THAT
gEA3qjf-3DM_6 LET'S IS JUMP RIGHT
gEA3qjf-3DM_7 IT REALLY GRAB ONE FROM ANY CHANCE OF START ROW THROW CATCH CATCH JUST LIKE YOU DID WE LEARNED THROUGH THREE BALLS YOU WIN THIS WITH CLUBS
gEA3qjf-3DM_8 ON EACH THROW HAS TO GO ACROSS SINGLE SPIN AND ONE MAKE SURE IT'S IN TIMES THAT'S THROW THROW CATCH CATCH
gEA3qjf-3DM_9 NOW AS YOU PRACTICE OF BOTH HANDS MEANING YOU START WITH THE RIGHT HAND'S WHO AND THEN DO IT WITH YOUR LIFE FORCE
gEA3qjf-3DM_10 SO IT'S LEFT RIGHT CATCH CATCH RIGHT LEFT CATCH CATCH
gEA3qjf-3DM_11 I WANT YOU TO TRY AND KEEP THAT GOING AS FLUIDLY AS POSSIBLE RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT LEFT THAT
gEA3qjf-3DM_12 IN FACT IS THAT YOU DON'T REALLY I THINK ABOUT IT TILL THE SPINS WORKOUT PRETTY WELL NEEDING TO REALIZE THERE'S THAT GET IN BETWEEN THE TWO CLUBS THAT WOULD MOVE ON THAT ARE IN THE ADD THE THIRD CLUB
gEA3qjf-3DM_13 TO SIT HERE PRACTICING RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT WHICH YOU THINK ABOUT POSTURE THING ABOUT THE THROWS THING ABOUT THIS THEN WANT THINGS TO KEEP TRACK OF I KNOW IN FACT IS ENOUGH AND GET A CLEAN
gPPDoNCUEgM_1 SO I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT TIME ON OR TECHNIQUE WHICH IS WHICH IS CALLED TRACING
gPPDoNCUEgM_2 IF THE WHOLE IDEA OF TRACING HAS TO DO WITH FIGURING OUT WHERE THINGS ARE GOING GO DECIDING HOW TO PUT THEM THEY'RE PUTTING THEM IN THE RIGHT PLACE
gPPDoNCUEgM_3 SO IN THIS CASE FLATTEN AFTER IS A P THAT I WANTED PUT RIGHT HERE SO THAT I END UP WITH PLACING ENDS FACING
gPPDoNCUEgM_4 SO IF THIS HAPPENS HAVE THE FEET OVER HIS THAT I HAVE DESIGNED AND HAVE FOOD SO WHEN THAT I DO IS AN WHEN A JUST TRACE OVER IT AND I CAN BE MAKING WILL ADJUSTMENTS ALONG THE WAY SALMON CHAINS THAT SHAPED IT'S A LITTLE TINY BIT
gPPDoNCUEgM_5 AND NOW WHEN IT IS LONGER
gPPDoNCUEgM_6 IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU RUN INTO TO DO IN A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORK
gPPDoNCUEgM_7 AND GIVES WHO'S RUSHING THE JOB
gPPDoNCUEgM_8 IN REAL LIFE YOU THAT IT GOES LOWER THAN THIS
gPPDoNCUEgM_9 NOW IF THAT'S SAFE AND I DECIDED VEST IS THE WEAR LONG
gPPDoNCUEgM_10 I WON'T LOOK OF OUT LIKE THAT
gPPDoNCUEgM_12 SELF FROM THE NORTH WITH
gPPDoNCUEgM_13 NOW A FIFTH
gPPDoNCUEgM_14 MAKEUP HIM ON
gPPDoNCUEgM_15 THINK ABOUT THIS
gPPDoNCUEgM_16 THINK ABOUT HAVE THIS GOES IN THIS COMES
gPPDoNCUEgM_18 SO NOW AFTER YOU'VE FULLER TRAYS THIS OF THAT GET AND TRACE THE BACK
gxoXqMWJ8dY_1 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M ERIC WILLIAMS AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT READING MUSIC
gxoXqMWJ8dY_2 SO FOLLOWING UP WITH OUR DISCUSSION OF FLATS LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SHARKS
gxoXqMWJ8dY_3 IF WE MOVE TO THE NEXT MEASURE WE HAVE AN F AND WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WHEN THE BASS CLEF AND THE BASS CLEF AS THE BOUGHT ABOVE AND BELOW THE F LINE SO THAT'S A DEAD GIVE AWAY THAT THAT'S A BUT IF YOU WANT TRY YOUR GRID BOARD TO ALIGN HOLE AND THEN ALSO BRING INTO ANYWAY HERE'S F THE VERY NEXT NOTE IS IN HALF WITH A SHARP SYMBOL IN FRONT
gxoXqMWJ8dY_4 THAT MEANS TO RAISE THE AT A HALF STEP HI
gxoXqMWJ8dY_5 THEN THE VERY NEXT NOTE IS ALSO ONE HALF BUT WE HAVE THAT NATURAL SIGN IN FRONT OF THE AIR SO ALL THAT BY NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHY THAT'S THERE THE LIMITS VALUE ANYWAY
gxoXqMWJ8dY_6 THIS F SHARP WOULD NORMALLY IMPACT THIS F AND MAKE IT A SHARP ALSO CAN THEN OF THE RULES OF ACCIDENTALLY
gxoXqMWJ8dY_7 ACCIDENTALS BY THE WAY IS THE NAME FOR ALL HIS THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
gxoXqMWJ8dY_8 ACCIDENTALS INCORPORATE FLAT SYMBOLS SHARP CYMBALS AND NATURAL SONG
gxoXqMWJ8dY_9 SO THAN THE ACCIDENTAL ON THE F SHARP WOULD NORMALLY MAKE THIS ENOUGH YOUR BUT SINCE WE DON'T IN THIS CASE WE DON'T WANT THAT TO THE SHARP WE HAVE TO USE THE NATURAL DESIGN TO READ THE REDUCE THAT BACK TO REGULAR AIR WE HAVE F F SHARP F NATURAL
gxoXqMWJ8dY_10 AND AGAIN THE REASON WE DON'T HAVE A NATURAL SIGN IN FRONT OF THIS THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT IS JUST PLAIN F AND WE DON'T NEED THE FOR NATURAL ON
gxoXqMWJ8dY_11 THAT IS CONFUSED AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT
gxoXqMWJ8dY_12 FOR THE F F SHARP AND THEN AT NATURAL OF ALL THIS IS ALREADY YOU NOW
gxoXqMWJ8dY_13 HOPEFULLY THIS MAKES MORE SENSE
gxoXqMWJ8dY_14 THAT EXPLAINS FLATS AND SHARPS AND NATURAL
gfZGAL2ZRDU_1 NOW AFTER WE'VE REMOVED EVERYTHING OF THE EXISTING TOWARD ALL WITH A CLEAN FRET FOLDS OR WITH

gjwN7jwh9q8_2 I SAY WE NEED TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE OF OUR TRADE
gjwN7jwh9q8_3 THERE BE NOTHING MORE EMBARRASSING TO ME THAN GOING OUT TO PURCHASE A SADDLE AND FINDING OUT THAT I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT I WAS TALKING
gjwN7jwh9q8_4 I NEED TO KNOW WHAT PARTS ARE THERE SO THAT I CAN DISCUSS AND DECIDE WHICH ONES ARE MOST IMPORTANT IN THE FIT TO ME
gjwN7jwh9q8_5 NOT TO MENTION IT'S JUST A GOOD THING TO UNDERSTAND LANGUAGE WHEN YOU GO INTO THE SPORT

gd86ZcveJQY_1 HEY WELCOME BACK
gd86ZcveJQY_2 IT'S GOT A COURSE FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
gd86ZcveJQY_3 WOMEN TALK A LOT ABOUT ON HOW TO MAKE YOUR VIDEOS LOOK PROFESSIONAL
gd86ZcveJQY_4 NOW OUR THOUGHT ABOUT LIGHTING
gd86ZcveJQY_5 BUT IT'S A SOMETHING ABOUT DIGITAL VIDEO IN GENERAL
gd86ZcveJQY_6 IT IS VERY VERY CRUCIAL THAT YOU PAY TENDONS LIGHTING
gd86ZcveJQY_7 ESPECIALLY LOW LIGHT LEVELS
gd86ZcveJQY_8 THEY DON'T DO VERY WELL
gd86ZcveJQY_9 EVEN SOME OF THE THINGS YOU'VE SEEN IN THEATERS ON SOME OF THESE DIGITAL MOVIES ESPECIALLY STAR WORSE WHICH ONE OF THE FIRST DIGITAL MOVIES ON SHOT AND ALL IN ALL THESE WILL FORMAT THEY STILL FEEL A CLOSELY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH LIGHTING
gd86ZcveJQY_10 A BIGGER MENTIONED BEFORE WHEN BIG ON WE HAVE DARK LEVELS OF BLACK IN AND GRATE IT MAKES THE CAMERA WORK HARDER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT'S SCENE
gd86ZcveJQY_11 KEY OF REALLY REALLY A CLOSE LOOK AT YOUR LIGHTING AND EXPOSURE LOW
gd86ZcveJQY_12 THAT MEANS YES THE HOT INVEST IN LIGHTING KIT OF SOME SORT OF HAVEN'T ALREADY
gd86ZcveJQY_13 YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY
gd86ZcveJQY_14 AND TO LIGHT HERE I'VE HAD FOREVER
gd86ZcveJQY_15 HANDLING COSTLY A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS
gd86ZcveJQY_16 BASICALLY ON YOU CAN CHOOSE WHATEVER COW LIKE YOU WANT
gd86ZcveJQY_17 THESE ARE THE MOST PLACES WITH ONE CALLED BAR INDOORS HERE AND THAT'S JUST SO THAT YOU CAN CONTROL SOME OF THE LIGHT ON IN CERTAIN AREAS
gd86ZcveJQY_18 A LOT OF THESE LARGER MEANS LATER ON POINT ON LENGTH AND THEN YOU CAN NARROW IT DOWN
gd86ZcveJQY_19 THERE'S ALSO YOU HAVE THE UMBRELLA HERE
gd86ZcveJQY_20 JUST PERFECT FLOOR DIFFUSE LIGHTING
gd86ZcveJQY_21 IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU WERE AND SHOOTING SOMEBODY SNARE POINT LIGHT DIRECTLY AT <UNK>
gd86ZcveJQY_22 THESE ARE POINTED OUT WITH A FUEL IT'S SOFT SLITS LOTS OF HARD TO SHADOWS ON OUR HARDEN SHOULD WHICH SHOWS ANYWAY BUT SOFTEN EVERYTHING THE USING ROLLERS
gd86ZcveJQY_23 NOW THE BEST THINGS TO DO IS SHOOTING INDOORS IS TO USE A SINGLE LIGHT AS IF IT'S SUPER BRIGHT AND JUST SIMPLY POIGNANT BOUNCE THE LIGHT OFF THE CEILING
gd86ZcveJQY_24 THAT'S HOW ON BEING TAKE RIGHT NOW
gd86ZcveJQY_25 AS A SINGLE LIGHTING THAT IS POINT UP AT THE CEILING END THAT DIFFUSE THAT LIGHT BECAUSE CEILINGS WHITE AND GIVES IT A NICE GLOW
gd86ZcveJQY_26 IF YOU CAN DO WITH ONE LIGHT GRAY BUT TO LIGHT IS BETTER AND REALLY NICE PROFESSIONAL QUALITY USE THREE LIGHTS
gd86ZcveJQY_27 AND YOU USE ONE AS THE NAME OF FILM CAN SOMETIMES A SPOT
gd86ZcveJQY_28 BASICALLY THAT'S IT WITH LIGHTING OR THE WALL OR ISSUE
gd86ZcveJQY_29 IF YOU CAN AFFORD THESE THAT'S OKAY
gd86ZcveJQY_30 I'M STILL HIM THAT ADVISE YOU TO INVEST IN SOME KIND OF LIGHTING
gd86ZcveJQY_31 MAYBE YOU CAN BUY THE CUT A LIGHT IT SITS ON TOP OF YOUR CAMCORDER IN YOUR SHOE AND YOU CAN MOUNT IN THERE
gd86ZcveJQY_32 ALWAYS PAY ATTENTION ARE LINING
gd86ZcveJQY_33 AND YOU CAN BUY AT LIKE THAT GOES ON TOP YOU CAMERA ON IT YOU CAN AFFORD LIGHTS LIKE THIS THAT FITS IN THE SHOE
gd86ZcveJQY_34 PAY ATTENTION LIGHTING IS IT'S THE MOST CRUCIAL PART OF DIGITAL VIDEO
gd86ZcveJQY_35 NEXT LET'S LOOK AT HOW ALL THIS WORKS WITH YOUR COMPUTER
GmN2IFIkwv8_1 NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT OUR TALL
GmN2IFIkwv8_2 REMEMBER AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING THE BALL OUT RIGHT MAY SHOW AT ANY ACCURATE IN
GmN2IFIkwv8_3 OKAY WHEN PLAYING A VIOLENT IF YOU WANT TO BE IS RELAXED AS POSSIBLE
GmN2IFIkwv8_4 SEE HOW I'M ABLE TO DO LIST WRITING IS
GmN2IFIkwv8_5 THE NATION HUMANS DO THAT'S AN WITHIN TONGUE OF A
GmN2IFIkwv8_6 SO LET'S LIGHT SHOW IT OVERNIGHT FLEXING ON THE STRING
GmN2IFIkwv8_7 AND THEN ALL SPACE IN BETWEEN THEM LINE AND THE HAIR IT MEANS SOMETHING WRONG
GmN2IFIkwv8_8 YOUR SCRUNCHING MOUNTAIN ONCE
GmN2IFIkwv8_9 YOU WANT LIKE THIS
GmN2IFIkwv8_10 SITTING IN A SOUND
GmN2IFIkwv8_11 YOU DON'T WANT YOU TO FLUFFY LIGHT
GmN2IFIkwv8_12 WHEN YOU WANNA SOUND IT'S IN AND IN FOR EARS CEO'S IN TO PRACTICE
GmN2IFIkwv8_13 <UNK>
GmN2IFIkwv8_14 A HIGH ON HOW HIGH HANAHAN
HjPS59Erxgw_1 ONE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT VALUES OF THE ORNAMENTS THAT I HAVE
HjPS59Erxgw_2 LIGHT IS THAT BEFORE IF YOU GET A REFERENCE BOOKING EXACTLY HOW MUCH THESE ORNAMENTS ARE WORTH THIS YEAR
HjPS59Erxgw_3 THEY PRICES ARE GOING TO VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR
HjPS59Erxgw_4 SOME WILL INCREASE SEVERAL DECREASE
HjPS59Erxgw_5 BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY THESE ORNAMENTS ON THE SECONDARY MARKET OR USED ON THE YEAR THAT IT WASN'T PUT OUT IS A GOOD IDEA TO USE IS A BASE FOR NEW BY ORNAMENTS
HjPS59Erxgw_6 WE GOT A DAY YOU CAN FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH IT'S WORTH IN CLEAR THAT TO WHAT PRICE THAT THEY'RE ASKING
HjPS59Erxgw_7 SOME OF THESE AND LOSING THE BEST INCREASE IN VALUE IS THE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE BETSEY CLARK FIRST SERIES
HjPS59Erxgw_8 THAT'S OVER TO DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS NEW
HjPS59Erxgw_9 IT'S NOT WORTH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS
HjPS59Erxgw_10 THIS ONE WHICH IS THE VERY FIRST FROSTY FRIENDS ORNAMENT SOLD FOR SIX DOLLARS THE YEAR THAT RELEASED
HjPS59Erxgw_11 IT IS NOW WORTH SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS AND THE FIRST THREE HOUSES OF THE SELJUK SERIES THOSE THREE HOUSES TOGETHER OR SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE DOLLARS
gDGrAAY42rE_1 YOU WILL PROBABLY FIND YOURSELF ENCOUNTERING SOME FRUSTRATION IN THE PRACTICE OF IN IS PRACTICE
gDGrAAY42rE_2 THIS ISN'T GOING VERY WELL CELERY IT WILL WILL OKAY BUT THERE YOU GO IF THERE'S A PERFECT CIRCLE
gDGrAAY42rE_3 AND WITH THE USE OF THE DIVIDER FLUTES OTHER THINGS CAN HAPPEN I COULD SAY OH I WANTED TO THIS IS THE NINE AREA WHERE YOU AND GO WITH THAT YOU CAN MARK THAT
gDGrAAY42rE_4 ANYWAY A DIVIDER COMES IN HANDY WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT FIGURE OF HATMAKER CIRCLES WHAT SIZE WHAT PROPORTIONS IS ON
gDGrAAY42rE_5 SEE ARE CLEAN THIS
gDGrAAY42rE_6 ANOTHER WAY TO CLEAN THINGS EVEN DO THIS WITH THE TENDONS AS WELL AS A JUST TAKE A PIECE OF PAPER GO LIKE THIS OUR SECOND FILL THIS UP A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT THAT'S HOW YOU CLEAN INSIDE'S ALSO WITH ITS PEOPLE PANS
gDGrAAY42rE_7 ANOTHER THING IN A LEDGE DIMENSIONAL AS I THINK ABOUT IT IS TO HAVE THIS LITTLE JR AND THIS IS ACTUALLY ALCOHOL SO I CAN USE IT SOMETIMES TO CLEAN OFF MY TENDS TO STEPS AND MAYBE TO DO THIS ONCE IN AWHILE AND COULD TISSUES INCLUDE A WATER
gDGrAAY42rE_8 AND IT ALSO USE TISSUES SLIT CLEANING THINGS LIKE THIS AND A RIGHT HERE DIP IT IN WATER OR ALCOHOL OFTEN I USE A TISSUE TO CLEAN IT OFF
gDGrAAY42rE_9 THEY HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFULLY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU REALLY WANT PEOPLE TO IS VERY TO BE TOOLS CLEAN

HAjRnO19Pds_10 THE OTHER THING WE CAN DO WITH A POWER LANDING IS AS SOON AS WE LAND WE MAY USE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BRAKE WILL COMBINATION OF BRAKE AND THROTTLE
HAjRnO19Pds_11 AS SOON AS WE'RE ON THE GROUND WE CAN GO SHIFT OUR EYES FROM LOOKING AT THE HORIZON IN THE RUNWAY TO HER MIRROR FOCUS ON TAXING ALONG WITH THAT WING

GI3mKlEwDr8_1 ALONE SHE FROM AROUND THE CLEARWATER KUNG FU CENTER
GI3mKlEwDr8_2 IS MY ASSISTANT MELISSA AND THIS IS STANDING GRAPPLING
GI3mKlEwDr8_3 THE NEXT MOVE THAT WERE CAN BE DOING IS AN UPWARD HAND LOCK
GI3mKlEwDr8_4 SO THIS ONE IS AGAIN USING THE WRIST ACTION LIFTING AND THIS WAY
GI3mKlEwDr8_5 SO THIS ONE WILL GO FROM A RIGHT HAND SHAKE LIKE THIS
GI3mKlEwDr8_7 SO THE HAND SHAKE IS JUST ONE WAY THAT WE GUIDE AND PRACTICE AND REALLY CAN BE DONE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS OF <UNK>
GI3mKlEwDr8_8 IF YOU GET WRIST CONTROL HANG CONTROL
GI3mKlEwDr8_9 WE JUST GO OVER THE BASIC HAND LOCK
GI3mKlEwDr8_10 I'M ON A FLIP THIS AROUND THIS WAY SO YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY
GI3mKlEwDr8_11 SO FROM THIS POSITION WHEN THEY DO IS I'M GOING TO USE THE WEDGE OF MY HAND AND I'M GETTING HIT IT RIGHT INTO MELISSA'S WRIST BONE ARE CARE
GI3mKlEwDr8_12 OR RIGHT ON THE BEND OF IT
GI3mKlEwDr8_13 AS I DO THIS IN A STEP IN WITH MY LEFT FOOT
GI3mKlEwDr8_14 AND THEN A CRADLE MY RIGHT ELBOW TO MY BODY IN A MINUTE PULL THIS ARM BACK OR MY SHOULDER
GI3mKlEwDr8_15 TWO THINGS HAPPEN HERE
GI3mKlEwDr8_16 ONE MY LEFT ARM COMES UNDERNEATH HER ELBOW LOCK HER ELBOW INTO THE STRAIGHT IN POSITION
GI3mKlEwDr8_18 SO THIS WAY THAT I GET HURT IT COME COMPLY OF WHAT I WANT
GI3mKlEwDr8_19 THE LOG ITSELF IS NOT THE ELBOW WITH THE WRIST HERE
GI3mKlEwDr8_20 SO WHAT'S HAPPENING BASICALLY IS I'M TAKING THE HAND THEN I'M PUSHING THE HEEL OF MY HAND FULL WHEN I'M PULLING THE FOUR FINGERS OR MY THUMB AND INDEX BACK THIS WAY OKAY AND LOCKING THE HAND
GI3mKlEwDr8_21 NOW WHAT HAPPENS USUALLY IF SOMEONE USUALLY MOVES OF THIS SO AS I BEFORE YOU MOVE JUST TAKE ONE STEP BACK MELISSA SO WE DO IS WE GO WITH THEM
GI3mKlEwDr8_23 ONE COMMON MISTAKE THAT PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY DO THOSE THEY LIKE THIS AND THEN WHEN THE PERSON WAS A STEP ACTING LIKE THIS
GI3mKlEwDr8_25 SO THEY LEAVE THEM
GI3mKlEwDr8_26 WE WANT TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH THE PERSON
GI3mKlEwDr8_27 SO AND REMOVE THEY MOVE
GI3mKlEwDr8_28 AGAIN ONE LAST TIME WILL NORMAL SPEED
GI3mKlEwDr8_29 OH AND THEN APPLY PRESSURE INWARD
GI3mKlEwDr8_30 IS CALLED UPWARD HAND LOCK
_gXFdaJ6dR4_1 A GOOD <UNK> BRING THE CLOVE IN OF FUN

_gXFdaJ6dR4_5 OF IN THE THE DOUGH IN
_gXFdaJ6dR4_6 WITH A HALF OF AND WE JUST WITH A VERY IN
_gXFdaJ6dR4_7 THE REASON FOR DOING THIS THE HOLD THE HOW IT AWAY FROM THEM OUT SO THAT IT WINDS YOU DON'T GET THAT SLAPPING OF THE HIGH YOUR LINE ON THE MASS
_gXFdaJ6dR4_8 IF WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO LIVE A BORDER BOATS IN A SMALLER HALF THIRTY YEARS EIGHTEEN YEAR THAT SLAPPING OF THE LINE
_gXFdaJ6dR4_9 SO ALL THE LINES HOLD WITH AN ACID HAS A COURTESY
gM0gs9Umw-Y_1 CERTAIN A DO ANOTHER VARIATION OF THE SUPER FUN CENTS A LIP
gM0gs9Umw-Y_2 WHAT MAKES IT FUN IS CHALLENGING YOURSELF
gM0gs9Umw-Y_3 DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT
gM0gs9Umw-Y_4 THE MORE YOU FALL DOWN THE MORE I FALL DOWN THE MORE I TRUST MYSELF
gM0gs9Umw-Y_5 BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT UP AND ONE OF ALL THEM

GsgXatk8ayI_2 HERE WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF A CARD WITH THICKER THE SKULL DRUMS FAT
GsgXatk8ayI_3 NORMALLY COSTS ONE COLORLESS AND TO BLOW BUT WITH THE KICK OR COST OF TWO COLORLESS AND ONE BLACK I'M IT THE TOTAL COST BECOMES SIX TO BLUE ONE BLACK AND THREE COLORLESS
GsgXatk8ayI_4 VIA THE ADDITIONAL KICKER COST IS THAT YOU DISCARD CREATURE CARD FROM YOUR HANDS
GsgXatk8ayI_5 NOW IT'S NORMALLY JUST A TWO TO FOR THREE BUT IF YOU PAY THE KICK ARE CROSSED THAN IT ALSO GETS FLYING AND X PLUS ONE PLUS ONE COUNTERS WE'RE X'S THE CAN DISCARDED CREATURE CARDS CONVERTED MANA COST
GsgXatk8ayI_6 SO IF HE FOR INSTANCE DISCARDED FROG MIGHT AND PAID SIX FOR THE CREATURE IT WOULD BE A FOUR FOUR FLY IN RATHER THAN JUST INTO TWO
GsgXatk8ayI_7 THE KICK OR COST MOST THE ANNOUNCED DURING THE PLANE OF THE SELLER ABILITY WHEN YOU GET ANNOUNCE ADDITIONAL UP COSTS WHEN YOU RUN CHOOSE YOUR MODE AND DECIDE WHAT AXIS

HdDPAe23QK8_2 HALF STUDENTS WORKING BREWS AND IT YOU HAVE A CLUSTER OF STUDENTS WHO TEND TO BE DISRUPTIVE YOU DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT IN WORKING TOGETHER LAURA MAYBE YOU DEFINITELY DO AND OUT TIGHTER THE TWO REASONS WHY
HdDPAe23QK8_3 IT USE LET THEM NOT AND YOU'VE ASSIGNED GROOVES AROUND THE CLASS AND USE LITTLE DISRUPTIVE STUDENTS UP
HdDPAe23QK8_4 THOSE DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY IN THEIR NEW GROUP
HdDPAe23QK8_5 THE NEW GROUP MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT THEIR LITTLE BUTTONS IN THE CLASS WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO PARTICIPATE
HdDPAe23QK8_6 ENCOURAGE THEM NOT TO BE DISRUPTIVE
HdDPAe23QK8_7 ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO GOOD WORK BECAUSE THAT'S THE STANDARD OF THE GROOVE LITTLE OR YOU COULD TAKE A DIFFERENT TACTIC AND YOU CAN LET ALL DISRUPTIVE STUDENTS WORK TOGETHER AND IF THERE'S A TIME LIMIT ON THE ACTIVITY NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN THAT WILL MAKE IT SO EVERY OTHER ROOT GETS IN ANY BECAUSE THAT REVIEWING THEIR WATER AND THE DISRUPTIVE GROUP GETS AND D BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T PROPANE AND SO THAT IS ALWAYS AN OPTION IS TO PLACE THEM AND GROUPS

grOFjMzA9EQ_4 AND WHEN YOU TAKE THE INTERIOR MEASUREMENT SOMETHING IN ONE HOPPING CRISSCROSS LIKE THIS
grOFjMzA9EQ_5 ANYONE HOLDER CALIPERS DIRECTLY OVER THE CENTER LINE IT REPEATS SIGNATURE GETTING THE MAXIMUM DIAMETER MEASUREMENT
grOFjMzA9EQ_6 AND IT IS GOING TO ADJUST OR CALIPERS AND HOLD THEM OVER THE PEAS IN TELL THE CORNERS OF THE CALIPERS TOUCH JUST AT THE VERY TOP OF YOUR LID GALLERY
grOFjMzA9EQ_7 YOU WANT THE WIDEST MEASUREMENT
grOFjMzA9EQ_8 AND ONCE YOU'VE GOT A MEASUREMENT THAT ARE HAPPY WITH YOU TAKE HIS FIRST PAIR OF CALIPERS THIEF IF ANY LINE THE SECOND CARE CALIPERS UP TOUCHING THE EDGES OF THE FIRST PAIR OF CALIPERS FOR THE TRUE MEASUREMENT IS ON THIS WAY BECAUSE YOU'RE IN A MEASURE THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR LID RATHER THAN THE INSIDE

gEtTXn_UJQg_1 HI I'M CHRIS FAIRCLOTH ARTISTIC DIRECTOR ANKLE OWNER OF SALON TEEZ
gEtTXn_UJQg_2 FOR EXPERT VILLAGE THIS IS HOW TO TRIM WOMEN'S HAIR
gEtTXn_UJQg_3 WE'LL BE USING A HORIZONTAL TYPE OF SECTIONING FOR THIS
gEtTXn_UJQg_4 JUST FROM THE TOP OF THAT YEAR AROUND THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR AND CREATE A STRAIGHT LINE COMING STRAIGHT ACROSS AND THIS IS OR HORIZONTAL SECTION
gEtTXn_UJQg_5 NOTICE MY FINGER ANGLE IS MORE OF A HORIZONTAL POSITION
gEtTXn_UJQg_6 IT MIRRORS THE SECTION THEN A JUST A
gEtTXn_UJQg_7 BUT FOR NOW BE USING A BALL THAT HOME CUTTING METHOD
gEtTXn_UJQg_8 THE REASON I WANT TO DO THIS IS IT KEEPS YOUR THUMB JUST SLIGHTLY IN THE THUMB HOLE AND IT ALLOWS ME NOT OF THEM ARE REST SO THAT OUR WRIST BECOMES UNSTABLE OR ONE OF THE ON FITS ALL THE WAY INTO THE FOAM WHOLE CREATING MORE OF A QUIET EMOTION
gEtTXn_UJQg_9 SO THE CUTTING HOME THAT FALL AND IT WILL JUST TO CUT THE BLADE THEN IN THE ON IT TO USE IF
gEtTXn_UJQg_10 GAREN PALMER ALL OUR CUTTING BLADE IS ACTUALLY DON'T HOT USING VERY LITTLE TENSION AND SLIGHTLY TRIMMING THE HAIR OFF
gEtTXn_UJQg_11 NOW WE'VE GOT A NICE CLEAN LITTLE <UNK>
gEtTXn_UJQg_12 MOVE OVER TO THE NEXT SECTION IN MIRROR LINE THAT I CREATED ON THE RIGHT SIDE FOR LESS EYE
gEtTXn_UJQg_13 IT'S IMPORTANT THAT MELODIC POSITION IS IN FRONT OF THE HAIR THAT I'M ACTUALLY CUTTING
gEtTXn_UJQg_14 STANDING TO THE LEFT FIRST ENDING TO THE RIGHT MIGHT ACTUALLY INCREASE MY FINGER ANGLE OR GIVE ME MORE OF A SHORT TO LONG OR LONG THIS LOOK OUT OF THE FIVE
gEtTXn_UJQg_15 THE ONLY THING THAT WHOLE PIECE SO WHAT I'LL DO IS ACTUALLY SOME SECTION NEXT ACTION SO THAT I CAN SEE WHERE MY THIGH IS IN LINE AND THEN UP
gEtTXn_UJQg_16 BUT I WILL ACTUALLY SLIT TO SLIGHTLY THROUGH MY FINGERS AND NOW THE <UNK> THAT HERE ON THE LEFT SIDE
gEtTXn_UJQg_17 SINCE I'M RIGHT HANDED AND WEREN'T RIGHT TO LAUGH AND GO BACK TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND CREATE ANOTHER OR SOME ALIGN SUBSECTION IN MY RIGHT BACK SECTION
gEtTXn_UJQg_18 IF YOUR LEFT HAND OR YOU MAY WANT TO START ON THE LEFT SIDE AS IS PROBABLY EASIER TO WORK LEFT OR RIGHT OUT FOR THE GUESS
gEtTXn_UJQg_19 PLACE LIKE CONE END THE SIDE OF THE HEAD OR THE SIDE BACK OF THE HEAD IS SEE WHERE THE CONE STARTS TO COME OFF OF THE HIP FOR
gEtTXn_UJQg_20 THEY'RE OUT VISUALLY SEE WHEN THE TO CREATE THE NEXT SECTION AND JUST SLIGHTLY PLACEMENT FOAM IN AND BRING THAT LEG CREATE MY OR LITTLE LINE
gEtTXn_UJQg_21 I CAN LIVE THE HAIR UP AND SEE THAT I'VE GUY IS OF PREVIOUSLY AND HERE IS RIGHT UNDERNEATH THAT
gEtTXn_UJQg_22 I WANT TO HAVE THAT DOES SLIT SLIGHTLY AND TO MY FINGERS IN NOW CUTTING PALMING POLE AGAIN
gEtTXn_UJQg_23 BECAUSE THE TOP SECTION IS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN THE TEETH SECTIONS THAT WE HAD IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD I CAN JUST COMPLETELY DROP THIS SECTION DOWN A TONE THE HAIR IN ITS NATURAL FALL
gEtTXn_UJQg_24 THIS HERE THAT WON'T NECESSARILY COME ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK SO JUST CALL MY IN ITS NATURAL FALL
gEtTXn_UJQg_25 THIS FOOT PREVENT ANY SHORT TO LONG OR LONG TO SHORE
gEtTXn_UJQg_26 AGAIN A SIMILAR MIGHT ADD IS INSTANTLY WITH THIS LID PLYMOUTH FINGERS CAN
h5jC24uGHyo_1 A GOOD LOOK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO OUTFIT YOU'RE OFF THE FLIP IT HOW THIS ROTH OUTFIT IN HERE
h5jC24uGHyo_2 FOR THE CHICKEN LINES THAT ON ALONG THE OUTSIDE OF THE RAW OFF IF YOU ARE ON THE WAY OUT OF THE BOAT FOR ANY REASON YOU CAN GRAB HOLD OF THIS AND THAT KEEPS YOU CLOSE TO THE RAW OFTEN HOPEFULLY YOUR CREW CAN PULL YOU BACK IN
h5jC24uGHyo_3 ALSO IF YOU'RE RAFTING IN YOUR SITTING INSIDE THE ROTH IF YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE YOU CAN HOLD ON THE OUTSIDE AND HOLD ON THE INSIDE THROUGH THAT WAY YOU HAVE PRETTY SECURE SPOT IN THE BOAT
h5jC24uGHyo_4 THESE WE HAVE ONE SIDE THWARTS OF THAT YOU CAN HOLD ON ON WHEN YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE UNWANTED HAVE HIM UP FRONT <UNK>
h5jC24uGHyo_5 DO IT HAS TO HAVE A BOW LINER STERN MINE WE TEND TO HAVE MOST OF OUR BOATS OUTFITTED WITH THE STERN LINE <UNK> WHICH IS RIGHT ON THE BACK OF THE BOAT HERE
h5jC24uGHyo_6 THIS IS TALK TALK ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOAT OUT OF THE WAY SO THAT THEY'RE LAST ENTRAPMENT POSSIBILITIES
h5jC24uGHyo_7 THE STERN LINE IS USE ABOUT THE LENGTH OF THE BOAT AND IT'S USED TO TIE THE ROUGH UP WHENEVER YOU STOP
h5jC24uGHyo_8 AND THEN YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THE OILS ON THAT BACK AWAY SO IT'S OUT OF THE WAYS UNIT DRAGON A LINE
h5jC24uGHyo_9 YOU CAN DAISY CHAIN THE ROPE SO THAT IT'S OUT OF THE WAY IN
H5AZWktsnYs_1 NOW MY TEA TO A CLASSIC
H5AZWktsnYs_2 THIS IS CALLED A WHOLE LASHING
H5AZWktsnYs_3 IT'S A GREAT WAY OF ONE OF MINE TOGETHER A BUNCH OF STICK SO ARE YOU KNOW I DON'T METAL ITEMS TOOLS WHATEVER
H5AZWktsnYs_4 IT IS IT AROUND THE TABLE MOMENT TO USE MY LASHOMB TO BIND TOGETHER DOUBLE MY ARTIST TOOLS ARE A COUPLE PAINT BRUSHES A PENCIL AND A MARKER
H5AZWktsnYs_5 AND THEN GO TURNING IT AWAY SO ANY LASHING TOGETHER FOR THE RUN OFF MY TABLE
H5AZWktsnYs_6 SO THAT IS WHAT TAKE MY LENGTH OF ROPE THAT I HAVE HERE
H5AZWktsnYs_7 IF I BRING IT UNDER MY ITEMS
H5AZWktsnYs_8 IN THE ROUND OVER LIKE SO
H5AZWktsnYs_9 OOP LITTLE LOW MORE LENGTH
H5AZWktsnYs_10 THERE WE GO
H5AZWktsnYs_11 WHEN WE DO IS I'M A TICKET LIMIT PULL BITES UNDERNEATH THE REST OF MY WORKING END
H5AZWktsnYs_12 WILL PULL IT OVER AND THROUGH LIKE THIS
H5AZWktsnYs_13 AS YOU CAN SEE IS CREATES A WAS AN S SHAPE AROUND THIS
H5AZWktsnYs_14 AS A POOL IS TIGHT SO BY NICE
H5AZWktsnYs_15 AGAIN OF THIS ISN'T REALLY ENOUGH TO BIND TOGETHER
H5AZWktsnYs_16 SO TO FINISH THIS OUT IN A DUES RIDGES MISFIRE REGULAR REGULAR HALF NOT INTO IT
H5AZWktsnYs_17 THIS BUSHES TOGETHER MAKE IT LOOK BETTER
H5AZWktsnYs_18 THE TILE HALF NOT INTO
H5AZWktsnYs_19 <UNK> TO FINISH THIS OFF BY TYING A REEF KNOT IN TO
H5AZWktsnYs_20 IT NEVER GO
H5AZWktsnYs_21 NICE SIMPLE POLISH

grspb1X5oRI_1 HI THIS IS GINNY WITH SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL CRAFTS ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
grspb1X5oRI_2 ONE OF THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN DECORATE YOUR RAIN STICK IS TO USE CRAFT
grspb1X5oRI_3 IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE LINES THAT ARE LEFT BEHIND FROM THE PAPER TOWEL OR FROM WHATEVER TO VIEW USING THAT YOU WANNA KEEP IT TO THE NATURAL COLOR OF CRAFT PAPER IS A GREAT CHOICE
grspb1X5oRI_4 NOT A COUPLE OF OPTIONS
grspb1X5oRI_5 YOU CAN COVER YOUR TWO WITH THE CRAFT PAPER FIRST AND THEN PAINT AND DECORATE ON THE CRAFT FAVOR
grspb1X5oRI_6 OR IF YOU CAN DECORATE THE CRAFT PAPER BEFORE YOU PUT IT ON THE TWO
grspb1X5oRI_7 THAT'S WHAT I WOULD RATHER DO
grspb1X5oRI_8 SO YOU WANT TO CRAFT PAPER
grspb1X5oRI_9 WHICH ARE TO BEND IT
grspb1X5oRI_10 ROLL IT OUT SO THAT IT COMES TO THE EDGE AND AND GET YOURSELF JUST A LITTLE BIT BE ON THE EDGE SO THAT YOU HAVE AN OVERLAP
grspb1X5oRI_12 AND THEN SEW THE YOUR EDGES LIVING NICE AND STRAIGHT ROLL IT OUT A LITTLE MORE
grspb1X5oRI_13 IF THEY WITHOUT THE MARK
grspb1X5oRI_14 KEEPING YOUR EDGE STRAFE MAKE A NICE CREASE
grspb1X5oRI_15 RECAPTURE PENS WITH THE AMOUNT OF INK OR DRY OUT FOR
grspb1X5oRI_16 AND CUT OR CRAFT PAPER IT IT HOOK HIKE
grspb1X5oRI_17 ONCE YOUR FAVOR IS CUT AND THAT WAY IF ANYONE CUT IT THE LENGTH THAT YOU WANT FOR YOUR TWO
grspb1X5oRI_18 IF THE ON BOTH ENDS OF YOUR TUBE SECURITY WHAT YOUR CRAFT PAPER PROBABLY TO GO ALL THE WAY TO BOTH ENDS
grspb1X5oRI_19 SO YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE SAME THING
grspb1X5oRI_20 YOU'RE GOING TO MARK SLIGHTLY ON THE INSIDE TO SLIGHTLY ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR TWO SO THAT IT DOESN'T OVERLAP

grspb1X5oRI_24 YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND GLUE WITH ONTO YOUR TWO OF THE FOUR YOU DECORATE IT AND DECORATE IT ONCE OR ON YOUR TOOTH
grspb1X5oRI_25 OR IF YOU CAN LAY IT FLAT AND TAKE YOUR PAINTS AND MAKE YOUR DESIGNS ON YOUR CRAFT PAPER BEFORE YOU PUT IT ON YOUR TWO
grspb1X5oRI_26 FOR ME THAT SEEMS TO BE A SIMPLER WAY TO DO IT BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT TO WORK ON YOUR TWO
grspb1X5oRI_27 THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO
grspb1X5oRI_28 YOU CAN USE CRAYONS
grspb1X5oRI_29 YOU CAN USE PAINTS
grspb1X5oRI_30 YOU CAN USE MARKERS
grspb1X5oRI_31 AND YOU CAN JUST I'M SIMPLY MAKE LINES OR DESIGNS
grspb1X5oRI_32 WHENEVER YOU WOULD LIKE
grspb1X5oRI_33 YOU MIGHT EVEN TAKE A SPONGE AND PUT IT IN YOUR PAINT AND MAKE SPONGE DESIGNS
grspb1X5oRI_34 WHEN YOU FINISH THE ONE COVER YOUR TWO WITH CRAFT GLUE
grspb1X5oRI_35 WRAP YOUR CRAFT PAPER AROUND IT
grspb1X5oRI_36 USE A COUPLE OF THOSE RUBBER BANDS TO SECURE IT THROUGH
grspb1X5oRI_37 AND WAIT UNTIL IT'S DRY
grspb1X5oRI_38 IF YOUR PAINT IF YOU'VE PAINTED IT IN YOUR RUBBER BAND WOULD INTERFERE WITH THAT ON SOME TEETH

Gjq4hrxWuiQ_8 I SET AT JUST RIGHT NEXT TO THE LINE ON THE LINE THE NEXT TO IT
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_9 THE MONITOR OUT REAL STREET MINE BEING VERY CAREFUL NOT TO GO INTO ORTH ALIGNMENT ON
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_10 VERMOUTH
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_11 THE VERSE ONLY HALF OF IT THE OTHER END
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_12 MAKE SURE IT'S STILL OLLIEING NICE AND FIRE

Gjq4hrxWuiQ_14 IT'S ACTUALLY A TRICK I LEARNED OUT OF A
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_15 AND THE FRONT OF THE FROM IT DEALS MAKE OF <UNK> IN FRONT OF ME OF WHERE'S
Gjq4hrxWuiQ_16 I HAVE AND WHEN IT ON THE LIKE
HCKYA56xZo4_1 IN THIS CLIP WE WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR GLOSS IN YOUR HATS
HCKYA56xZo4_2 THESE LITTLE THINGS WILL MAKE A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE IN A VERY CRITICAL DIFFERENCE THING COMPARABLE IN SUBZERO OTHERS
HCKYA56xZo4_3 JUST LIKE WITH THE SOAP CALLING YOU START WITH A STAR WITH A SOAK LINER AND WORK YOUR WAY OUT
HCKYA56xZo4_4 AND IT HAS BOTH WITH YOUR HEAD COVERING AND ON YOUR GLOVES
HCKYA56xZo4_5 WE START WITH A SILK LIAR IF AN ANGLE WILL POLYPROPYLENE LINER
HCKYA56xZo4_6 AND THEN ON TOP OF HOPEFULLY A LINER I PREFER TO WEAR AGGLOMERATE WHICH IS A CLOTH KNIT IN COMBINATION
HCKYA56xZo4_7 THIS IS A LOW BLOT IT AND BY WORKING IT THIS WAY IF AN AUTO MY FINGERS FREE TO ADJUST THINGS
HCKYA56xZo4_8 TO PULL THE TRIGGER TO SHOOT THE GET THINGS OUT A MY GEAR WITHOUT HAVE TO TAKE MY GLAUS OFTEN GET MY WHOLE HAND SHIELD IN THAT MANNER
HCKYA56xZo4_9 AND ALSO FOR FALL WHETHER PURPOSES YOU CAN GET A LEATHER SHELL THE FOOT OVER TOP OF THE MAT AND THAT'LL ALSO STILL HAVE A LITTLE CREASE IT WHERE YOU GET YOUR FINGER OUT TO WORK THE TRIGGER
HCKYA56xZo4_10 THE OTHER CONSIDERATION IS IS WHERE MOST YOUR HE LAST WILL COME FROM IS AROUND YOUR NECK AND FROM YOUR HEAD
HCKYA56xZo4_11 SO YOUR HEAD COVERING AND AROUND YOUR NECK BECOME A VERY VERY CRITICAL TO MAINTAIN YOUR BODY IN SUBZERO TEMPERATURES
HCKYA56xZo4_12 A NICE SILK SCARF WRAP AROUND YOUR NECK WILL INCREASE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WHILE YOU'RE ON STAND BY GOOD FIFTEEN TO TWENTY DEGREES
HCKYA56xZo4_13 IF THIS CASE THE LEAF FROM TOO MUCH HEAT FROM ESCAPING AROUND YOUR NECK AND OPEN COLLAR AREA AND IT ALSO WORKS AS AS A REGULATOR SO YOU CAN REGULATOR BODY TEMPERATURE
HCKYA56xZo4_14 WHEN THE STAR GET TWO WARMTH <UNK> OVER THE SCARF OR TAKE IT OFF FERMENT WOULD START BACK ON
HCKYA56xZo4_15 GET A SAFELY WITH USING THIS SOAP FACE MASK FOR IF AN AND FOLLOWED BY WILL <UNK> OF AN ANNUITY ON TOP COOL YOU CAN PUT FOR THE WEATHER CHROME
HCKYA56xZo4_16 THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE THE WEAR GLASSES REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM
HCKYA56xZo4_17 BECAUSE NOW ALL MY MOISTURE ALL THAT'S COMING EVAPORATING OUT OF MY BODY ESCAPES AROMA GLASSES
HCKYA56xZo4_18 SO KEEP IN GLASSES SLOT OUT IN IN THESE TEMPERATURES IS HARD TO DO
HCKYA56xZo4_19 SO TRY WORD PLASTIC LENSES OR GO TO PAIR GLASSES AND YOU TAKE ONE PAIR OFF
HCKYA56xZo4_20 HE THICKENER POCKETS OF A WARM UP IN A NEW CAUSE THE SWITCHING GLASSES
HCKYA56xZo4_21 LOAD IF YOU'RE HANDICAPPED LIKE I AM WE HAVE TO WEAR GLASSES ALL A TIME THIS BECOMES LITTLE BIT OF A HASSLE
h7nobJX6cyc_1 THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT FORKS SPOON A KNIFE THE THIRD RING HANDFULS AND WHAT YOU CAN EVEN YOUR PARTY FOOD TO LIGHTEN UP AND UP AND OUT COLOR

h7nobJX6cyc_3 THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN DEFLATE AND AND FAILED TO HEAR A WAY THAT I PERSONALLY REALLY LIKE
h7nobJX6cyc_4 START OUT WITH SOME KIND OF CLEAR GLASS CONTAINER SOME THEM YOU CAN USE A SQUARE AROUND ANYTHING THAT WILL HOLD THE AMOUNT OF UTENSILS YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING
h7nobJX6cyc_5 IF I PUT SOME CUTE LITTLE VITAL CONFETTI IN HERE
h7nobJX6cyc_6 AND THE RINGS ON AND HEARTS
h7nobJX6cyc_7 SPLIT THE BOTTOM CONDIMENTS BUT IT AROUND THEM
h7nobJX6cyc_8 THEN I FOOT HALF OF IT TAKES SOME NICE EIGHTH HOWEVER MANY NEED
h7nobJX6cyc_9 THEY COME IN PACKAGES OF TWENTY FOUR
h7nobJX6cyc_10 YOU JUST KIND OF PLACE THEM IN THEIR THIN MIX IT AROUND THREAD LOSERS' THROUGH THAT YOU NEED THAT
h7nobJX6cyc_11 TAKE THEM OUT OF THE <UNK> OUT THAT IN THERE
h7nobJX6cyc_12 YOU COULD ALSO DO IN A SEPARATE CONTAINERS FOR EACH ONE
h7nobJX6cyc_13 AND THEN THE FOURTH
h7nobJX6cyc_14 MAKING A REALLY KEY OF F STAND WAY FOR PEOPLE THIEF TISSUES IF THEY'RE UTENSILS
G6ObYwZN4tg_2 HEIGHT YOU

G6ObYwZN4tg_6 NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW THE FULCRUM ACTUALLY OF FACTS THE DIVING WORK UP AND
G6ObYwZN4tg_7 THE BOARD IS GOING UP THE ENDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHERE YOU HAVE THE FULCRUM
G6ObYwZN4tg_8 SO IF I MOVE THE FULCRUM ALL THE WAY UP WHAT I'M DOING IT ACTUALLY SHORTENING THE DISTANCE TO THE END OF THE BOARD
G6ObYwZN4tg_9 IF YOU HAVEN'T TRIED OUT TO PUSH DOWN ON SOMETHING IF YOU HAD A HEAVY WEIGHT FISCHLER DISTANCE YOU HAVE BETWEEN YOURSELF AND THAT WEIGHT THE HARDER IT IS THE PUSH BAM
G6ObYwZN4tg_10 BUT IF YOU GOTTA FULCRUM IN THE MIDDLE AND YOUR DISTANCES MINOR IT'S A LOT EASIER TO CLOCHE WOULD THEN OR MOVE THAT OBJECT
G6ObYwZN4tg_11 SO WHAT I'VE GOT THE FULCRUM ALL THE WAY OUT WHO WERE IS A LITTLE STIFFER
G6ObYwZN4tg_12 IT DOESN'T THEN AS MUCH
G6ObYwZN4tg_13 OKAY IF I MOVE THE FULCRUM <UNK> ALL THE WAY THAT HALF ON LENGTHENING THE DISTANCE TO THE END OF THE FORWARD AND MY FULCRUM
G6ObYwZN4tg_14 THAT COULD MEAN THE BOARD WILL AND FOUR
G6ObYwZN4tg_15 NOW A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT
G6ObYwZN4tg_16 WHEN THE BOARD AND FARTHER IT TAKES LONGER TO GO UP AND DOWN
G6ObYwZN4tg_17 IF IT'S CLOSER UP IT TAKES A SHOE OVER TIME

Gc-QWcSyGAA_7 IT'S CALLED A ONE COUNT OF THREE COUNT OF FIVE COUNT AND A SEVEN COME
Gc-QWcSyGAA_8 IF YOU NOTICE ALL THOSE NUMBERS ARE ON
Gc-QWcSyGAA_9 THE REASON RATHER ON IS IF YOU DO IT ON AN EVEN COUNTING CONTINUES THEY BREATHE IN THE SAME SIZE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_10 SO WHAT IS THAT MEANS YOU
Gc-QWcSyGAA_11 NOW PEOPLE STRING IN IT BECAUSE ARE SWIMMING IN YOU REAL ONE SIDE SWIM BREATHE IN THE SAME SIDE SWIM GREEN IN THE SAME SIZE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_12 IF YOU NOTICE THAT THAT EVEN COUNT
Gc-QWcSyGAA_13 SITTING ON ONE TWO THREE ONE TWO THREE ONE TWO THREE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_14 NOW MAKE IT ON
Gc-QWcSyGAA_15 ONE TWO THREE THREE THE STEMS GOING ONE TWO THREE NIGHT OR EVEN WITH THE SIDE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_16 SO YOU ALWAYS COUNT EITHER ONE THREE FIVE OR SEVEN HAD WHEN REFILL COMFORTABLE WITH HIS THEM WAS LONGER DIFFERENTLY AND GET A BUILD UP WITH THAT
Gc-QWcSyGAA_17 SO MOST TO QUICKLY OR TAUGHT TO DO EVERY THREE STROKES
Gc-QWcSyGAA_18 EVERY THREE DRESS OR A THREE STROKES TO TAKE A BREATH
Gc-QWcSyGAA_19 SO THE MACHINE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_20 ONE TWO THREE THREE THIS ARM GOES ONE TWO THREE THREE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_21 AND IF YOU REMEMBER I'M BREATHING AS I'M PULLING
Gc-QWcSyGAA_22 THAT'S WHY I TAKE MY BREATH
Gc-QWcSyGAA_23 NOT AS I'M GOING ON THREE CHINA BREVE BECAUSE MY ARMS LOOKING
Gc-QWcSyGAA_24 THAT CUT A COMMON SENSE REALLY LEARN HOW TO SWIM
Gc-QWcSyGAA_25 SO JUST REMEMBER WHICH EVER ARMY START TO BEGIN TO PULL THAT IS THE SIDE THAT YOU WOULD WRITE OUT
Gc-QWcSyGAA_26 AND THEN YOUR HADWIN AND LEARN HOW TO COUNT
Gc-QWcSyGAA_27 SO REALLY IF YOU LEARNED THE BASS TRYING TO DO IT OUT OF THE WATER FIRST ENCOUNTER HAT
Gc-QWcSyGAA_28 IT'S A COW WANTING TO THREE THREE OR IN TWO THREE READY ONE TWO THREE BRIDGE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_29 AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I DO OUTSIDE OF THE WATER AND PEOPLE ALL THE TIME
Gc-QWcSyGAA_30 THERE WE GO INTO THE WATER WE TRY AND IF I NOTICE THAT YOUR <UNK> IS THAT NOT ABLE TO DO IT THAT WILL GET THAT OUT OF THE WATER AND DO IT AGAIN
Gc-QWcSyGAA_31 BECAUSE THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE HEART OF THINGS TO LEARN IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT BECAUSE IT'S ALL LIGHT YOU GET ACCOUNTING AHEAD
Gc-QWcSyGAA_32 AND YOUR ARMS DON'T EVER THINK THAT HE DOES BECAUSE THIS IS ONE THE NEXT TIME IT'S ONE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_33 THEY JUST SWITCH
Gc-QWcSyGAA_34 SO THE WAX FLAME IS TO PEOPLE IS DON'T EVER TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHICH HAND IS WHAT NUMBER
Gc-QWcSyGAA_35 JUST CALENDAR HEAD AND JUST MOVE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_36 SO ANY ARM CAN BE ONE TWO THREE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_37 STUDENT WHICHEVER ONE YOU START OFF WITH
Gc-QWcSyGAA_38 SO REMEMBER IT'S ONE THREE FIVE SEVEN CAP FOR FREESTYLE SWIM
Gc-QWcSyGAA_39 I AM A SECTION OF FREESTYLE AS A CONTINUATION OF STEP NINE AND TO YOU HOW TO BREED WENT ON DIFFERENT COUNTS
Gc-QWcSyGAA_40 SO YOU DO IT ON ONE COUNTER TYPICALLY AND IT ON A THREE COUNT OF FIVE COUNT OR SEVEN CAN
Gc-QWcSyGAA_41 SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU GO TO HAVE HOOF <UNK>
Gc-QWcSyGAA_42 AND THIS WHICHEVER ARM IT MAYBE THAT'S THREE HAS IT'S MOVING BACK COMBING YOU WOULDN'T THREE TWO ONE SIDE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_43 TAKE A BREATH
Gc-QWcSyGAA_44 IT LINED HALF TO THREE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_45 IS THAT ARMS MOVE BACK YOU BREW TIBETAN
Gc-QWcSyGAA_46 TAKE A BREATH COULD HAVE SECOND ONE
Gc-QWcSyGAA_47 TWO HALF CLEAT WHEEL AND
Gc-QWcSyGAA_48 SO FOR EVERY THREE STROKES AND IT TO
HEibb83JnGQ_1 SO LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW TO MARK YOUR LINE FOR THE DEPTH THAT YOU WANT A FISH AT
HEibb83JnGQ_2 IN THIS IS USEFUL WHEN YOU'RE FISHING TIP UPS
HEibb83JnGQ_3 SO WE'VE SOUNDED OUR HOLE
HEibb83JnGQ_4 THE SOUND IS ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT NOW SO WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW DEEP IS
HEibb83JnGQ_5 SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO FROM THE HOLE THAT LINE IN MY FINGER
HEibb83JnGQ_6 AND TYPICALLY WHEN YOUR ICE FISHING MOST PEOPLE FISH TWO TO THREE TO FOUR FEET OFF THE BOTTOM
HEibb83JnGQ_7 SO WE GOT THAT
HEibb83JnGQ_8 SO WRITTEN ESTIMATE LAUNCH <UNK> TWO THREE FOUR FEET
HEibb83JnGQ_9 AND THEN HOLD THAT
HEibb83JnGQ_10 NICE AND HOLD IT IN MY MOUTH FOR THIS EASIER
HEibb83JnGQ_11 OR LEMON OF BRING UP MY LIFE SET THAT ASIDE FOR NOW
HEibb83JnGQ_12 AND THIS IS THE DEPTH THAT I WANT A FISH AT
HEibb83JnGQ_13 THIS IS WHERE I WANT FULL LINED BE ON MY REAL
HEibb83JnGQ_14 SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THAT
HEibb83JnGQ_15 ONE YOU CAN TIE A VERY SIMPLE SLIP KNOT AND JUST THREW REALLY ARE LINED UP TO THAT POINT
HEibb83JnGQ_16 HOWEVER WHEN A FISH TAKES THAT OFTEN THAT NOT COMES OUT
HEibb83JnGQ_17 FILL THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO DO WITH
HEibb83JnGQ_18 AND THAT ENTAILS AS HAVING A SMALL BOBBER ON YOUR LINE THAT YOU PUT IT THE POINT WHERE YOU WANT TO FISH AT
HEibb83JnGQ_19 AND THEN THE OTHER OPTION SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY THREADED BOUGHT MOVE ON TO THE LINE
HEibb83JnGQ_20 THAT WORKS VERY WELL
HEibb83JnGQ_21 WHAT I LIKE TO DO THINGS JUST A SIMPLE LEAF TIE THE SLIP KNOT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AND THEN JUST INSERT A MATCH STICK INTO IT
HEibb83JnGQ_22 AND TIGHTEN THAT NOT DOWN
HEibb83JnGQ_23 AGAIN THAT'S WHERE YOU REALLY ARE LINED UP TOO
HEibb83JnGQ_24 WHEN HE CATCHES FETCH AN YOU WANNA REBATE AND FOR SOME OR YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT DEPTH YOU'RE FISHING AT AND WHERE YOU WANNA SET THAT LINE OUT AGAIN
HEibb83JnGQ_25 WHEN YOU'RE DONE FOR THE DAY SO ABOUT THE MAX STICK THROW IT AWAY TAKE OUT A SLIP KNOT YOU'RE READY TO FISH THE NEXT <UNK>

H2UbBPFSinc_14 THESE THREE GUYS ATTACK EITHER MAKE THE SHOT A MISSED SHOT

HdTHup4E8gM_2 THIS IS DAVID JACKEL ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT CAUSES A COLD
HdTHup4E8gM_3 THERE ARE MANY MANY VIRUSES THAT CAUSE THE SYMPTOMS THAT WE CALL THE COMMON COLD WHICH IS WHY IT'S SO HARD TO FIGHT THE COLD
HdTHup4E8gM_4 BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT VIRUSES IT'S HARD TO COME UP WITH A VACCINE
HdTHup4E8gM_5 SO WHAT CAUSES US TO CATCH THIS VIRUS
HdTHup4E8gM_6 TWO THINGS WE CAN IMMUNE SYSTEM AND EXPOSURE THE GERMS
HdTHup4E8gM_7 YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM CAN BE COMPROMISE BY VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING STRESS WHEN YOU'RE SO WORKED OUT YOUR BODY CAN PERFORMANCE NORMAL FUNCTIONS
HdTHup4E8gM_8 HAVING A LACK OF EXERCISE HAVING A PORT DIET WHICH IS WHY THESE ARE SO IMPORTANT AND ALSO ALLERGIC DISEASES
HdTHup4E8gM_9 TO ACTUALLY CATCHING A COLD VIRUS THOUGH YOU HAVE TO BE EXPOSED TO IT WHICH MEANS IT'S GONNA HAPPEN THROUGH CLOSE CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE A VIRUS IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH NOT VERY SANITARY CONDITIONS WE ARE TOUCHING THINGS OF GERMS ON THEM STUFF LIKE THAT
HdTHup4E8gM_10 THE TWO MAJOR FACTORS IN BECAUSE YOU HAVE A COLD ARE HAVING A WEEK IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THEN WITH THAT WE CAN SYSTEM BEING EXPOSED TO GERMS
HdTHup4E8gM_11 SO IN ORDER TO PREVENT A COLD WOULD YOU HAVE TO DO IS BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM AND REDUCE YOUR EXPOSURE TO GERMS

H1HAMTFXwqI_1 AND NEXT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT A PARTICULAR PROBLEMS THE CAT HAS IN SOME WAYS THAT WE CAN ADJUST THIS KIT YES OF BEHAVIORS OF THEIR PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN HOME
H1HAMTFXwqI_2 NOW AS FAR AS STUFF AND CATS ARE CONCERNED AN OFFENSIVE THE DESTRUCTIVE OF THIS AGE BECAUSE IN ONE SHORTEN THE CLAWS AND EVERYTHING
H1HAMTFXwqI_3 AND SO THERE'S SEVERAL COACHES IT YOU CAN TAKE IT TO THAT
H1HAMTFXwqI_4 THIS CAN CAN BE AN INDOOR CAN'T
H1HAMTFXwqI_6 OKAY AND PUSH THE SOLE OF THE TOPIC OF BACK CAST THAT STAYING INSIDE AND LIVES TWICE AS LONG AS FAST OR OUR OUTSIDE
H1HAMTFXwqI_7 I'VE CATS ROUTE SIGHTED IN ALL KINDS OF TROUBLE WITH HYADES AND GAUZY HOURS AND LIVE DRAMA OUTSIDE
H1HAMTFXwqI_8 BUT CASSIS THAN SIDE GO GET A LOT OF DISEASES
H1HAMTFXwqI_9 I ALSO HAVE A LOT TRAUMA HE SO WHEN YOU DECIDE TO DO THAT
H1HAMTFXwqI_10 SOMETIMES IT'S HARD WITH KESLER INSIDE EDGE ON BECAUSE IT CAN BE DESTRUCTIVE
H1HAMTFXwqI_11 AND SO IF I WANTED IT IN ADDITION TO A FEW PRODUCTS THAT SOMETIMES REALLY CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT
H1HAMTFXwqI_12 I'M AT NIGHT WHEN THESE CAST STARTED DO SOME CLAWING BEHAVIOR ON THE APPROPRIATE TO OBJECTS IN THE HOUSE ONE THING IS YOU CAN DO IS YOU CAN OF PROVIDE SOME PLACE WHERE THEY CAN FLOW

hcnPkFJ83Wk_1 HI I'M RICK ONE PURITY FROM SHOE DIVA LOCATED IN WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO SELECT SHOES TO WEAR WITH CAKEY PAINTS
hcnPkFJ83Wk_2 I'M <UNK> WITH SIMPLY THINK OF CAKEY PAINT YOU ARE GOING FOR A SIMPLE MORE CASUAL LOOK WHERE SNEAKERS WILL PROBABLY BE ARE MOST POWERFUL OPTION
hcnPkFJ83Wk_3 BUT IF YOU WANTED TO GO CUTE WITH THAT THEN YOU HAVE A COUPLE MORE OPTIONS
hcnPkFJ83Wk_4 FLATS ARE ALWAYS A GOOD OPTION SO WE'RE WITH CAKEY PAINTS
hcnPkFJ83Wk_5 THEY KEEP THE LOOK SO COMFORTABLE AND AS WELL AS BEING CASUAL
hcnPkFJ83Wk_6 A SECOND OPTION YOU HAVE OUR LIGHT IS AND WITH WEDGES THEY GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT HEIGHT AS WELL AS SUPPORT AND DOWN THE COLOR CHOICES ARE ANALYSTS WITH THOSE BECAUSE KHAKIS I'M NEUTRAL PALATE SO YOU CAN WEAR ANYTHING FROM GREEN TO PIENTA BLUE YELLOW OR KEEPING A SIMPLE WITH JUST RAM
hcnPkFJ83Wk_7 OUR THIRD OPTION IN OUR LITTLE THONGS HANDLES
hcnPkFJ83Wk_8 THESE WORK WELL WITH ON CAKEY PANTS AS WELL BECAUSE THEY STILL HELP KEEP THE LOOK ON CASUAL AND THEY ALSO ON ALLOW THAT LOOKS OF THE COMP
hcnPkFJ83Wk_9 AND THOSE AT THREE OPTIONS THIS YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM WHEN SELECTING SHOES TO WE'RE CAKEY PAINTS
G5lqG2VO4jI_1 I'M JUDY FRANCK FOR EXPERT VILLAGE WE'LL BE DOING SOME NAIL ART TODAY
G5lqG2VO4jI_2 OKAY NOW THE HARDEST PART IS COOKING IT COLOR IS
G5lqG2VO4jI_3 IT'S REALLY UP TO YOU IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS IT'S THE DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
G5lqG2VO4jI_4 YOU CAN REALLY MAKE A MISTAKE
G5lqG2VO4jI_5 YOU JUST MIGHT GET LOTS OF LAYERS BUT WHEN I THINK OF A SUNSET WHICH THAT'S A WOODEN TODAY IS A SUNSET BEAT SCENE I LIKE TO HAVE A VARIETY OF COLORS SO IT LOOKS LIKE A SEVEN GOING DOWN
G5lqG2VO4jI_6 SO IN THE START ARE PICKING COLORS THAT LOOK LIKE THIS ON A SETTING
G5lqG2VO4jI_7 SO WHAT I'LL DO IS I'LL TAKE A LITTLE PAINT OFF A LITTLE PINK PAIN AND THIS CAN GO AHEAD AND GET THAT GO ON IT REAL QUICKLY UP AROUND YOUR CUTICLES DOESN'T EVEN MATTER THAT IT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN A LITTLE SLIME MAKE SURE THAT IT GETS UP THEIR CLOSE THE CUTICLE AND STARTS THE LAYERING PROCESS
G5lqG2VO4jI_8 NOW THIS IS I HAVE NO THOSE THINGS IF YOU HAVE LIKE LITTLE I'M GETTING SOME LITTLE PIECES OF LIKE LITTLE LOBBIES IN MY PAINT THAT HAPPENS ONCE IN AWHILE I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHY THE CLEAN YOUR BRUSH AND START OVER GRAB ANOTHER WILL SPEC A PAINTING HANDS WILL KEEP GOING
G5lqG2VO4jI_9 HANDS IF YOU SEE ANY WILL BLOBS YOU CAN GET THEM OUT RIGHT AWAY WITH YOUR BRUSH JUST KEEP MOVING AROUND TO GET IT OUT
G5lqG2VO4jI_10 SOMETIMES IT'LL BE SO HARD AND PIGMENT IN THE PAN BOTTLE ITSELF THAT COMES OUT AND IT MIGHT JUST BE THAT THE PAINTS FOLD
G5lqG2VO4jI_11 VIEWS HARD TO TELL
G5lqG2VO4jI_12 I DIDN'T THEM <UNK> THE C TOO MUCH OF THIS BEFORE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE OF GETTING AND BEGINNING A LITTLE BIT OF THAT LATELY
G5lqG2VO4jI_13 IT DOES NOT COME OFF I'M PUSHING OFF MY PAPER TOWEL
G5lqG2VO4jI_14 IT'S NOT A PROBLEM AND JUST KEEP GOING
G5lqG2VO4jI_15 THE ONLY TIME THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM LIKE YOU CAN SEE SOMETIMES IS THAT IF YOU'RE DOING OF LITTLE DETAILS THEY FACE OR SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT THOSE WILL BLOBS AND UPON THERE THAT WOULD BE A HARD TO GET OFF OF THAT CAN OF THE TAIL
G5lqG2VO4jI_16 TO GET A BASE COAT DOWN AND NINE TO START THINKING OF DIFFERENT COLORS THAT YOU CAN LAYER WITH
G5lqG2VO4jI_17 SO I'M MIXING A LITTLE BIT THIS RED AND YELLOW TOGETHER TRY TO GET OF LIKE THE SOME SUNSET COLORS
G5lqG2VO4jI_18 AND THIS CAN START SNAPPING IT ON THERE JUST REAL QUICKLY
G5lqG2VO4jI_19 AND I CAN SEE THAT ARM LIFT HER FINGERS OTHER STILL OF DIFFUSES MOVE THEM AND AGAIN HUSEN UP AGAIN
G5lqG2VO4jI_20 IF YOU CATCH AND SUNSET IT IN A ONE AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN KEEP GOING DOWN WITH YOUR COLORS SO IT LOOKS MORE OFTEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING KNEES OUT IN A CAN OF SEE ALL THE LITTLE DETAILS LIKE THE PINK ENOUGH BEHIND IT MIGHT THERE'S NO STRIPES
G5lqG2VO4jI_21 IT COULD HAVE CLUB IN FRONT OF IT
G5lqG2VO4jI_22 WE ALWAYS PUT LAYERS OF THING SO THAT CAN HELP COVER ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW

gKpYu50LLps_1 OKAY SO WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT BLOOD PRESSURE IS
gKpYu50LLps_2 OF BLOOD PRESSURE IS DIVIDED INTO CYST ALL OF PRESSURE AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURE IN THOSE PRESSURES REPRESENT DIFFERENT SITE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE CARDIAC CYCLE
gKpYu50LLps_3 ON THE WHEN YOU GET HER RECORDING AT LIKE ONE TWENTY OVER EIGHTY
gKpYu50LLps_4 THAT TOP NUMBER IS USES DOLLAR PRESSURE AND THE BOTTOM NUMBER IS YOU HAVE DICED OFF PRESSURE AND WHAT THOSE PRESSURES REPRESENT IS HOT THEY REPRESENT A PRESSURE WITHIN THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM
gKpYu50LLps_5 THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM WHICH IS THE A OR THE END OF THE PRESSURE WITHIN THAT THIS IS A REPRESENTATION OF THE PRESSURE HOT IN THE AORTA WHEN YOU TAKE SOMEONE'S BLOOD PRESSURE
gKpYu50LLps_6 SO THE SAYS DOLLAR PRESSURE IS THE PRESSURE WITHIN THE ART OF JUST AFTER THAT HEART CAN TRACKS
gKpYu50LLps_7 THIS A ORDER IS FILLED UP WITH HIGHER AMOUNT OF PRESSURE
gKpYu50LLps_8 SO IT'S THE PRESSURE WITH IN THE AIR ORTA OR THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM OFF MORE SO THE BREAK YOU ORDER IF AFTER THE HEART CONTRACTS
gKpYu50LLps_9 IN THE DIASTOLIC PRESSURE IS THE PRESSURE WITHIN THAT ARTERIAL SYSTEM JUST AFTER THE HEART RELAXANTS SO WE HAVE CONSTANT CONTRACTION RIGHT HERE IN THIS VENTURE GO SHOOT SPLIT UP THROUGH THE THE ORDER AND THEN IT RELAXES
gKpYu50LLps_10 THE PRESSURE DECREASES SO THAT'S WHY THAT DIASTOLIC IS A LITTLE BIT LOWER
gKpYu50LLps_11 IF IT'S AN HOUR AND TAKE AN ACTUAL PATIENT EXAMPLE AND SEE HOW THESE PRESSURES OPT RELATE TO SOMEONE THE ACTUAL READING

h72HD8ocVEM_1 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT USING COLLIN ARCHITECTURAL PHOTOGRAPHY
h72HD8ocVEM_2 NOW DOWN HERE IN MIAMI THE MANY BUILDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN USED WITH A GREAT AMOUNT OF COLOR
h72HD8ocVEM_3 AND THIS IS THE ATLANTIS CONDOMINIUM THAT YOU MAY HAVE SEEN IT ON THE FRONT CREDITS OF MIAMI VICE BACK IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES
h72HD8ocVEM_4 AND IT'S DESIGNED BY WORLD CLASS ARCHITECTS ARCHITECT ONICA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TOO
h72HD8ocVEM_5 AND THEY HAVE A RUN ON FOR THAT AMAZING USE OF COLOR IN A BUILDINGS
h72HD8ocVEM_6 SO LOOK HERE WE'VE GOT AN AMAZING COBALT BLUE SKY BRIGHT RED BALCONY YELLOW WILL ON A BLUE JACUZZI WITH THE GREEN IN THE BACKGROUND
h72HD8ocVEM_7 LILIES BRIGHT PRIMARY COLORS MAKE FOR A VERY INTERESTING COMPOSITION
h72HD8ocVEM_8 AND YOU CAN USE CALA TO TO ANIMATE YOU'LL PHOTOGRAPHS TO REMARKABLE DEGREE
h72HD8ocVEM_9 ALSO THE SAME TIME REMEMBERING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN ROCK THAT FOR PHOTOGRAPHY TO KEEP YOUR LINES STRAIGHT WITH THE SIDE OF THE PICTURE OF A BECAUSE THAT IS THE WAY THAT THE ARCHITECT INTENDED TO SEE
h72HD8ocVEM_10 DON'T LEAN BACK DON'T LEAN FORWARD
h72HD8ocVEM_11 WHICH CAN ON A TRIPOD AND SHOOTS STRAIGHT AS YOU CAN
h72HD8ocVEM_12 IF AT ANY TIME YOU CAN USE A TILT SHIFT LENS LIKE THIS THE TWENTY FOUR MILLIMETER THAT'S GOING TO HELP A LOT WITH YOUR ARCHITECTURAL PHOTOGRAPHY
h72HD8ocVEM_13 THE OTHER WAY OF DOING A IS USING FIGHTERS
h72HD8ocVEM_14 BUT THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO GET IT
h5XbO0N36WU_1 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE IT OUGHT OUT BASICALLY WHICH AGAIN WITH A COMPLETE PACKAGE WINTERS HEIGHT
h5XbO0N36WU_2 THERE'S US SUITED IN SUPINE HIGH FROM PROPER RETAILER
h5XbO0N36WU_3 IT ACTUALLY GETTING INTO A BRAND NEW KITE THAT WEREN'T THE IT'S TOTALLY GIVEN OF WORKING THE IN ORDER
h5XbO0N36WU_4 AND GETTING AN OLLIE ESSENTIALS AND EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR THE HIGH SUCH AS A HOLD OF BAR LINES AND AN ACTUAL KITE ITSELF OF BRIDLE THAT HAVEN'T BEEN AND STOP
h5XbO0N36WU_5 LOOK KIND OF GET AN F A GOOD ALERT ON
h5XbO0N36WU_6 BUT DIFFERENT AND GETTING A QUALITY PRODUCT
h5XbO0N36WU_7 IS CUT A HAZARD LIFE ANYTHING
h5XbO0N36WU_8 SO IF YOU KNOW HASSLE THINGS ALL A NOTE YOU COULD DEATHLY FIND YOURSELF IN HEIGHT NEAR SITUATION
h5XbO0N36WU_9 SO HEITNER LIGHTNER YOU MATH PRINCE OF EXPLANATORY
h5XbO0N36WU_10 IF YOU OUT CUT A OR OUT ON A REGULAR SUBTITLE COVER THE PRESSURE GAUGE
h5XbO0N36WU_11 IT PROBABLY UNITY AND IT'S ALL THESE EIGHTIES AN AREA WHEN USING IS PLAY OR A PALM SO AGAIN IT'S PROBABLY IN WORK FROM THEM FIRST DOESN'T TIME THINK THAT HIGH
h5XbO0N36WU_12 HE WANTED A GOOD SOLID FEEL ON HOW MUCH CRACKING ONE FOOT IN A HIGH
h5XbO0N36WU_13 FOR OUR HIGH IT'S ALWAYS BETTER
h5XbO0N36WU_14 AND THE MORE RIGID STRUCTURED THE PROFILE THAT HEIGHTS OF FLIES APPROPRIATELY
h5XbO0N36WU_15 IF YOU OPEN UP THE AIR INTO IT ENTERPRISING OF WIRE AND CLEAN UP WITH ONE FROM
h5XbO0N36WU_16 IF YOU FIND IT HOME VIDEOS DOTS HUMUS IN THAT BIRD BASE WE DON'T WANT TO THINK IT WAS AND INSERT A GENERAL LUBRICANT BASICALLY DOES GO THE ENTIRE STAFF
h5XbO0N36WU_17 BUT THEN HE'LL A COUPLE TIMES JUST WORKING IN AN OUT VIC'S FROM AND BOOM HAS BEEN OF SALSA JUST FIRST TESTS AND FOLLOW THAT ARE IN IT
h5XbO0N36WU_18 SO IF EVERY TIME IF YOU'RE USING A GEAR GENERAL MAINTENANCE NO ABSOLUTELY AND EVERY TIME NECESSITY
h5XbO0N36WU_19 THE ONE MAKE SURE ALL ARE SOFT POSITIVELY PROPER WORKING IN JUST AS GOOD AS NEW
h5XbO0N36WU_20 SO IT'S OUT
G_Cg1ldU2kg_1 THE NEXT AREA THAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT IS TRYING TO KEEP YOUR SHOULDERS ABOVE YOUR KNEES
G_Cg1ldU2kg_2 THE BASIC STANCE IN BOXING INSTEAD OF THEM STRAIGHT HERE IS ACTUALLY HAVE YOUR HEELS SHOULDER WIDTH APART
G_Cg1ldU2kg_3 AND FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT THAT COURSES THAN A VERY
G_Cg1ldU2kg_4 HI I'M TRAVIS AT ABOUT EIGHTEEN INCHES SHOULDER WITH SO HIS HIS HEEL SHOULD BE ABOUT EIGHTEEN INCHES APART TWENTY FOUR INCHES BETWEEN THEIR SOMEWHERE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_5 NOW AS THE THAT ADVANCING HE WANTS TO KEEP HIS SHOULDER JUST ABOVE THE KNEE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_6 THAT'S THE PROPER WAY OF DOING IT
G_Cg1ldU2kg_7 AN VICE VERSA
G_Cg1ldU2kg_8 GOING BACKWARD WILL MENTALLY TOO FAR BACK
G_Cg1ldU2kg_9 WE WANT IS STILL KEEP A SHOULDER ABOVE THE KNEE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_10 NOW SHOWING THE WRONG WAY IS IF IF HE MOVES HIS SHOULDER PAST DISNEY USE YOU CAN SEE HE'S WAY OUTSTRETCH OKAY AND THAT PUT THAT BACK FOOT UP OFF THE GROUND
G_Cg1ldU2kg_11 AND WHAT THAT'S GOING TO DO IT IS GOING TO HELP THEM TO TOPPLE OVER OF POSSIBLY
G_Cg1ldU2kg_12 SO IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HEEL GOES WITH THE SHOULDER
G_Cg1ldU2kg_13 KEEP THE SHOULDER ABOVE THE KNEES BASICALLY
G_Cg1ldU2kg_14 AND YOUR HEEL IS GONNA BE BELOW YOUR KNEE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_15 SO ONCE YOU GET YOUR SHOULDER BUT YOUR KNEE AND IT SHOULD BE FINE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_16 ALSO GOING BACKWARDS YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_17 IF THE SHOULDER IS PAFF HIS KNEE IN THE BACK HE'S GOT TOO FAR BACK THAT'S ALSO DANGEROUS SITUATION
G_Cg1ldU2kg_18 IF WE'RE MOVING TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT WHICH ALSO TRY TO KEEP THAT SHOULDER ABOVE THE KNEE AT ALL TIMES ON SO THAT WE'RE NOT LEANING TOO FAR OFF TO ONE SIDE
G_Cg1ldU2kg_19 WHICH IS OUR LEANING TOO FAR FORWARD TOO FAR BACK OR TOO FAR TO ONE SIDE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO GETTING KNOCKED OVER WHEN YOU DO GET PUNCH
G_Cg1ldU2kg_20 SHOULDERS ABOUT KNEES

gS8GzCQVGH8_7 SOME TYPE OF SOAP AND WATER OR ANTISEPTIC SOLUTION FOR FIRST AID CAN BE USED TO CLEAN THE WOUND AREA
gS8GzCQVGH8_8 THEN ICE CAN BE APPLIED TO REDUCE SWELLING AND PAIN
gS8GzCQVGH8_9 I SHOULD BE APPLIED IN TWENTY MINUTE INCREMENTS OF TWENTY MINUTES ON AND TWENTY MINUTES OFF TO AVOID HAVING SOME TYPE OF COLD INJURY FROM THE ICE PACK ITSELF OCCUR
gS8GzCQVGH8_10 AFTER THE APPLICATION OF ICE THE TOE COULD BE SPLINTED OR TAKE IT TO THE TOE NEXT TO IT TO REDUCE MOBILITY AND KEEP THAT TOE FROM FLEXING OR BENDING

gJGhRrSaPlQ_1 SO IN ORDER TO BID BEYOND THE SIXTY LEVEL YOU NEED TO HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF MELD TO SUPPORT YOU BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU STOP IT SIXTY ANNUALLY HAD TWENTY MELD YOU HAVE TO TAKE FORTY COUNTERS SO THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP AND HITS A SCORE SHEET AND OBVIOUSLY WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT
gJGhRrSaPlQ_2 IF YOUR SIDE HAS BIDS SIXTY RIGHT IN YOU HAVE THIRTY FIVE MELD YOU NEED TWENTY FIVE COUNTER IS TO MAKE THAT BID
gJGhRrSaPlQ_3 YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO GET TWENTY FIVE
gJGhRrSaPlQ_4 IF YOU DON'T HAVE TWENTY FIVE COUNTERS YOU WILL NOT MAKE YOU BID SO KEEP IN MIND THE STRONGER THAN MELD YOU HAVE IN YOUR HAND THE MORE ROOM YOU HAVE THE BIDDING
gJGhRrSaPlQ_5 FOR EXAMPLE IF WE HAD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY NOW WE HAVE A DOUBLE ON A SUIT THAT'S UP HOLLOW FULL AND NOW WE HAVE LOTS OF ROOM BECAUSE ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS MAKE OUR TWENTY MELD THAT'S THE BASIC REQUIREMENT WE SAY ABOUT TWENTY MELD UNDER FIFTY POINTS THAN A PICK OFF AN AWFUL LOT OF OF ROOM FOR ERROR IF WE'VE ALL TALL SHORTER ENCOUNTERS THAT IS OF WE DON'T HAVE MORE THAN ON YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE BEEN KNOWN COUNTERS THAT'S FINE
gJGhRrSaPlQ_6 WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE TWENTY AND THAT'S THE KEY NUMBERS SO AGAIN MELD BIDDING AND CON IS VERY IMPORTANT AND YOU SHOULD REMEMBER THOSE COMBINATIONS
GVLVEmMFvNE_1 DR JOE NEELY THAN I PRACTICE WITH THE BARTON OAKS DENTAL GROUP

GVLVEmMFvNE_13 IN ORDER TO KEEP IT FROM DESTROYING THAT IF YOU HAVE TO GO IN PHYSICALLY CUT THAT PART OUT
GVLVEmMFvNE_14 HI INTERNET LIFT THAT PART OF A TOOTH IT'S BEEN REMOVED AND HIS RESTORED WITH A FILLING
GVLVEmMFvNE_15 AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS TYPES OF FILLING MATERIALS
GVLVEmMFvNE_16 WHEN THE DEFECT BECOMES LARGE ENOUGH THAT STRUCTURALLY YOU CAN'T THE TICKET SUPPORTIVE FILLING LONGER

gH-FfNW0BDM_11 THESE ARE FAMILY IN A POSITION WHERE YOU CAN HOME SCHOOL THEM
gH-FfNW0BDM_12 FINANCES MEDIUM ISSUE
gH-FfNW0BDM_13 WE ALSO WANT TO TAKE IN CONSIDERATION IT WENT AND AGAIN THIS PROCESS TO STATE COMMITTED TO IT FOR APPEARED HOW OF REALIZING THAT THERE'LL BE WONDERFUL DAYS BUILD THE DAYS OF BLESSING END OF THE DAYS OF CHALLENGE
gH-FfNW0BDM_14 JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE TEACHING YOUR CHILD HOME DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE GOING ONE OR MORE
gH-FfNW0BDM_15 IF YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR THAT

h2dZglgVX3I_1 OTHER ARM VARIOUS METHOD OF DELIVERY OUT ONE TO HAVE THE MEDICATION THERE AGAIN DEPENDING ON THE AGE OF THE OF THE PERSON
h2dZglgVX3I_2 FOR MYSELF OF THOSE MENTIONING MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH THE NEBULIZER WAS WHAT MY SON WAS ABOUT NINE MONTHS OLD AND HE PROBABLY WOULD NOT OF TOLERATED THE MASKING ON HIS FACE
h2dZglgVX3I_3 MOST CONVEYED OR FROM TRY TEAR THE MASK AND MAKES FOR A FAIRLY UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE ALL THE WAY AROUND ON
h2dZglgVX3I_4 BUT FOR CHILDREN THAT LITTLE BIT OLDER OR ADULTS OUT ONE WAY OF DELIVERING THE MEDICATION A SHOW RIGHT HERE IS TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY AGAIN THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
h2dZglgVX3I_5 PUTTING THIS TOGETHER LIKE THIS YOU GOT THE TUBE HERE IN AND THIS IS THE PIECE AND TURN IT I LIKE SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY PUT IN THEIR MOUTH
h2dZglgVX3I_6 AND THEN ONCE YOU HAVE THAT ASSEMBLE ASSEMBLED AGAIN IN A CAN OF PUSHING TWIST A LITTLE BIT AND THE PERSON WOULD ACTUALLY HOLD IT AND PUT THIS IN THEIR MOUTH AND BE ABLE TO BREATHE THE MEDICATION IN THAT WAY SO THAT'S ONE WAY
h2dZglgVX3I_7 AND THEN THE OTHER METHOD IT OF YOU KNOW FOR A CHILD MEET YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THIS IS FOR A CHILD USE CUT THE DINOSAUR IT IN MY KIDS THAT APPRECIATE THAT ON IT AND THE MASK FORM
h2dZglgVX3I_8 AND ALL YOU TO DO IS DIRECTLY PUT THE MASK RIGHT ON TO HERE AND THEN OF COURSE THIS WILL GO AROUND THE CHILD'S HEAD AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO JUST GO AHEAD AND BREATHE IN IT AND IT
h2dZglgVX3I_9 IT AS THIS ALLOWS FOR SOME AIRFLOW OUT THE TO HEAR THIS ALSO ALLOWS FOR SOME MIX KEEPING OF AIR IN IN ON A MISSED THROUGH THE HOLES RIGHT HERE

gyM46ZenVQ4_6 HOWEVER IF YOU DON'T BREAK PROPERLY AND SAY YOU SCRATCH ON THE BRAKE WHERE YOU DON'T POCKET OF ALL WHEN YOU'RE DOING AT THAT POINT IS JUST TURNING CONTROL OVER THE TABLE TO YOUR OWN
gyM46ZenVQ4_7 AND IF YOU BROKEN UP REALLY GOOD GOOD IN POCKET VOLLEY NEUTERING CONTROL OF THE TABLE OVER TO YOUR OPPONENT ALL YOU'VE DONE IS JUST OPEN EVERYTHING UP SO THAT YOUR OPPONENT HAS AN EASY ROAD RUN OUT AN BEACH YOU OFF OF YOUR OWN BREAK

hhAazpDGZ-c_1 I AM DAVID CLEMEN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND TODAY WE'RE AND PAYING A PIECE OF GLASS INSIDE OF THE FRAME
hhAazpDGZ-c_2 OKAY SO I DECIDED TO GO WITH THE TREE END ON AND THEN PUT THE SUN IN THERE AS WELL
hhAazpDGZ-c_3 NOW WHEN I'M PAINTING ON GLASS YOU HAVE TO KIND OF THING IN REVERSE BECAUSE WHATEVER COLOR YOU PUT ON FIRST THAT CAN BE SEEN FIRST
hhAazpDGZ-c_4 AND SO YOU KIND OF BUILD ANY ALSO THE KIND OF DRAW IN REVERSE
hhAazpDGZ-c_5 SO THAT YOU CAN SEE HERE AND PUT THE BLACK ON HAD FOR THE BLACK DOWN FIRST AND THEN I PUT THE COLORS BACKWARDS AND AND VICE VERSA
hhAazpDGZ-c_6 YOU KNOW I CAN PUT THE BROWN HERE BUT THAT'S THE ONE THAT YOU SEE FIRST AND THEN THE BACKGROUND THAT THIS CANNA MUSTARD COLOR HERE
hhAazpDGZ-c_7 SO YOU JUST CUT HAVE TO THINK IN TERMS OF THE LAYERS GOING BACKWARDS VERSUS WHEN YOU PAINT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
hhAazpDGZ-c_8 YOU JUST CUPPING AS YOU GIVE
hhAazpDGZ-c_9 STUFF ON THUMB TO START WITH AND WENT YOU PAINT WITH ACRYLIC ON GLASS YOU DON'T USE ANY WATER ON THE PAINT BECAUSE IT TENDS TO STREET IF PEOPLE WATER ON IT AND THAT'S NOT DOWN AND SOME REALLY CAN HELP YOUR PAINTING OIL
hhAazpDGZ-c_10 I'M THE THICKEST OF BRUSH AND ARMS CAN USE IF LITTLE ROOM BLACK HERE <UNK> OF THEM WANT THE ON A TREE BE BLACK SINCE THE THE FRAME IS LIKE IN THE BORDERS WAY
hhAazpDGZ-c_11 AND THIS CAN COME INTO THE SPACE THAT A MARK OUT THEN AND IS GOING TO REALLY SIMPLE TREE
hhAazpDGZ-c_12 WE HAVE TO GET IT YOU HAVE TO TOUCH OR PAIN UP PRE OFTEN BECAUSE THE GETS THEN ON HERE IT'LL STREAKING ABOVE THE SEE THROUGH
hhAazpDGZ-c_13 SO YOU CAN HAVE TO REAPPLY MORE OFTEN THAN WHEN YOU'RE PAINTING
hhAazpDGZ-c_14 BUT IT'S A SMOOTH SURFACE IN AND IT IT FLOWS ON THEIR QUITE NICELY
hhAazpDGZ-c_15 AN INFECTION WERE PAINT
hhAazpDGZ-c_16 AND WE'LL CONTINUE IS IN THE NEXT SEGMENT

H7kbHukjb60_1 HE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF EFFICIENT IMLER NEEDS A LEAF YOU MOVE IT OUT OF TOWN DON'T TAKE A FISH DOWN TO THE NEAREST RIVER CREEK
H7kbHukjb60_2 YOU MAY THINK YOU DOING EVERY THE FISH A FAVOR GIVE HIM A NICE BIG COMB BUT IN REALITY YOU COULD ACTUALLY BE HEARD IN THE ECOSYSTEM OF THAT AREA
H7kbHukjb60_3 I'M BRUCE WITH ARCHITECT DROP ONE AUSTIN TEXAS
H7kbHukjb60_4 THEY WERE THEM BE DISCUSSING WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR FISH WHEN YOU CAN'T TAKE CARE OF HIM ANYMORE
H7kbHukjb60_5 THE BEST THING TO DO IF YOU GET A FRIEND WHO KEEPS FISH ASK THEM IF THEY CAN TAKE THEM
H7kbHukjb60_6 IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS WHO ARE KEEPING FISH TO COME BACK TO THE STORY GOTTEN FROM
H7kbHukjb60_7 CHANCES ARE THEY'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TAKEN OFF YOUR HANDS AND MAY ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A LITTLE MONEY BACK
H7kbHukjb60_8 PROBABLY NOT AS MUCH AS A SPONGE ON WHAT EVER THAT WHAT HELPS
H7kbHukjb60_9 THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO IS JUST DUMP IN YOUR FISH IN THE NEAR SCREEN
H7kbHukjb60_10 ALL THAT REALLY ACCOMPLICES IS INTRODUCING IS PIECES TO THAT RIVER SYSTEM THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE
H7kbHukjb60_11 MAYBE IT'LL DOES A TEMPERATURE WILL BE RIGHT WATER CONDITIONS WON'T BE RIGHT BUT MAYBE A LITTLE LIVE MAYBE IT'LL THRIVE MAYBE LITTLE BECOME THE SNAKE HEADS OF MARYLAND
H7kbHukjb60_12 YOU HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR THESE HENNA THINGS
H7kbHukjb60_13 SO THAT'S THE PROPER WAY TO RE HOME YOUR FISH
H7kbHukjb60_14 UNTIL NEXT TIME I'M BRUCE WITH <UNK>
HhlWUEbHBUk_1 A DRINK WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE IS CALLED A BACARDI VOLCANO
HhlWUEbHBUk_2 AND FOR SOMEONE WHO IS PUT SOME ICE IN A GLASS HERE AT THE END WE WILL DO ONE SHOT OF I'M SORRY RANGE YOU BELIEVE IT OR NOT A FULL HALF A GLASS OF ONE FIFTY ONE
HhlWUEbHBUk_3 SO FILL IT UP AND THE THAT TO BE ENOUGH ONE FOR THE ONCE YOU ARE REALLY SET UP A VOLCANO OFF AND WILL MIX AND HAVE A GLASS OF COLD ALL OF HIS GOING MIX THIS UP HERE IF ALSO DO THE JUICE OF HALF OF THE LINES OF HIS GRAB A FEW LIME WEDGES AND SQUEEZE THOSE THEN
HhlWUEbHBUk_4 IT'S GOING THROW THE WHOLE WEDGE IN A
HhlWUEbHBUk_5 WE GO FLAT AND NEXT SET OF FLOW AND LAST SINGER INTO OUR GOING POUR THIS IN A GLASS HALF AND WE'RE OF FLOATS SOME EVER CLEAR ON TOP WHICH IS GONNA BE AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE PROOF AND I CAN GO ALL THE WAY UP TO A HUNDRED EIGHTY PROOF SUCKY FLOAT THAT ON TOP OF FULL SHOT AND IT'S GREAT ABOUT THIS IS IF YOU WANT YOU CAN LIKE THAT ON FIRE AND FIND SOME WAY OF DRINKING IT
HhlWUEbHBUk_6 THAT'S BACARDI VOLCANO BOTTOMS UP
GwCV7S-_LQY_1 IN THIS STEP WILL BE PUTTING THE BINDING ON
GwCV7S-_LQY_2 HOWEVER THE FIRST STEP IN THE BINDING PROCESS WOULD BE TO EVEN UP THE EDGES OF QUILT
GwCV7S-_LQY_3 SO WITH THE ROTARY CUTTER AND YOU'RE CUTTING MAT HALF AND RULER YOU HUMAN ALL THE EDGES OF THE QUILT
GwCV7S-_LQY_4 HER NECK STEP IN THE PROCESS WOULD BE ACTUALLY MEASURING OR QUILT SO YOU GET THE CORRECT LENGTH OF THE BINDING
GwCV7S-_LQY_5 AND DEPENDING ON HOW YOU SO MAY DEPEND ON THE THIS SIZE OF THE QUILT
GwCV7S-_LQY_6 IN THE CASE OF OUR LITTLE OF FOR CATCH THAT WE DID HERE IT'S THIRTEEN BY TWENTY FIVE
GwCV7S-_LQY_7 THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO FIGURE THE LENGTH OF YOUR BINDING
GwCV7S-_LQY_8 NOW THE WIDTH OF THE QUILT AND THE LENGTH OF THE QUILT IF THEY'RE THE SAME IT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH SIDE THAT YOU PACK
GwCV7S-_LQY_9 WHEN THE CASE OF MY SMALL PIECE I HAVE HERE I HAVE ONE SIDE THE THIRTEEN INCHES AND ONE SIDE IS TWENTY FIVE INCHES
GwCV7S-_LQY_10 SO WE'LL CUT TWO PIECES OF BINDING THAT OR TWENTY FIVE INCHES LONG BY FIVE INCHES WIDE
GwCV7S-_LQY_11 AND THEN TWO PIECES OF BINDING THAT ARE FIFTEEN INCHES LONG BY FIVE INCHES WIDE
GwCV7S-_LQY_12 THE REASON THAT THEY WOULD BE FIFTEEN INCHES IS BECAUSE WE NEED TO EXTEND THE NEXT TWO INCHES ON EITHER SIDE TO CONNECT WITH THE ALL CROSSWISE BINDING
GwCV7S-_LQY_13 AND CUT THE BINDING AND THE FILLER YOU ACTUALLY NEED THE SAME SIZE PIECES FILLER OUT AS YOU'RE FINDING JUST PLACE THAT ON THE INSIDE AND PRESS SET
GwCV7S-_LQY_14 AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO WANT A FOLD YOUR BINDING IN HALF
GwCV7S-_LQY_15 AND WE'RE GOING TO PRESS IT SO WE HAVE A NICE EVEN PEAS AND FINDING ALL THE WAY ON HERE

gIU-VuKqGgA_2 THERE'S A FEW BREATHING EXERCISES THAT ONE SHOWED YOU BEFORE AND REALLY EVEN BEGIN TO PLAY IS AGAIN AND CUT A PUSH ON THE RIGHT HALF OR DOING IT

G4v22kM4QnA_4 ONE THING THAT I KNOW ON A LOT OF RECORD DON'T DO IS WHEN THEY GET ALL TEN STEP IN THEIR BUILT IN DOWN YOU OF PRESSURE THEY DON'T THEY DON'T BREEZE
G4v22kM4QnA_5 SO I WAS GOING TO CUT OF JUST OR DID SOME DEEP BREATHING AS I'M SETTLING AND I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK ABOUT MY LANE

G4v22kM4QnA_14 BY THAT POINT YOU'RE UP THERE YOU STAGING YOUR IN YOUR LANE YOU KNOW YOUR STRATEGY NINETY DOES GOTTA GO DELIVER WHAT YOU KNEW CREW TEETH HAVE ALREADY DECIDING
glY9q7Mq3Uo_1 WHEN I FIRST STARTED THIS BUSINESS TIME SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE DIFFICULT ARE YOU KNOW GETTING CLIENTELE AN AND HOW TO GO ABOUT DOING AT AN ANGLE YOUR MARKETING STRATEGIES
glY9q7Mq3Uo_2 YOU GO THROUGH A WHOLE BUSINESS PLANNING YOUR HEAD IN RIGHT THINGS DOWN AND YOU HAVE A GREAT BUSINESS PLAN IN IN MIND AND YOU KNOW HOW YOU TAKE IT FROM BEING ON PAPER TO ACTUALLY IN OPENING THE BUSINESS AND STARTING TO WORK
glY9q7Mq3Uo_3 THOSE ARE SOME THINGS THAT REALLY TOUGH
glY9q7Mq3Uo_4 I'M I'M REALLY GREAT PUTTING THINGS ON PAPER AND I'M REALLY GOOD AT TALKING TO PEOPLE BUT ACTUALLY GETTING OUT THERE IN AN ASKING FOR BUSINESS WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY HARD FOR ME TO DO
glY9q7Mq3Uo_5 SO I FOUND THAT IT WAS A REALLY GREAT USING A FREE CLASSIFIED ANIME ADVERTISING AND I JUST I'VE PUT ADDS ON THE END AND I JUST DECIDED YOU KNOW LET THIS IS SOMETHING I WANTED TO YOU
glY9q7Mq3Uo_6 I WANT TO MAKE SOME EXTRA MONEY <UNK>

glY9q7Mq3Uo_8 SO SOME TEXT ON AN BEING A GOOD NEED ON WOULD BE IN A JUST PAINT CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TELL TO THE SMALL THINGS THAT THAT PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT WAITING DOWN
glY9q7Mq3Uo_9 FINGERPRINTS ON THE FRAYED WIPING DOWN THE LIGHT SWITCHES
glY9q7Mq3Uo_10 SOMETHING THAT I DO IS OF LEAVE A LITTLE NOTE OF THINK YOU IN AN IN A MINUTE OR SOMETHING
glY9q7Mq3Uo_11 SOMETHING THAT FETCH YOU APART FROM FROM THE REST OF THE INDUSTRY
glY9q7Mq3Uo_12 COME UP WITH THAT LITTLE IN A PERSONAL TOUCH AN ANGLE FROM THERE
glY9q7Mq3Uo_13 ON SOME THINGS TO IT YOU KNOW TO MAKE SURE YOU STAY AWAY FROM WOULD BE INTO TAKING ANYTHING THAT IS NOT YOU WORDS
glY9q7Mq3Uo_14 MAKING SURE THAT YOU YOU KNOW DON'T DAMAGE SOMETHING IN IT AND IF YOU DO BECAUSE ACCIDENTS DO HAPPEN
glY9q7Mq3Uo_15 MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW COMPLAIN ABOUT IT AND LET THEM KNOW THAT SAYS OUT THEN IN AN TRAIN COVER THINGS LIKE THAT UP AND I'M A SO THOSE ARE SOME TIPS
glY9q7Mq3Uo_16 JUST FINDING YOUR WAY YOU KNOW YOUR PERSONAL TOUCH AN ANGLE AND FOUR
GCPe2Za7JV8_1 I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH AN OLD BUTTON FLY
GCPe2Za7JV8_2 AND I'M GOING TO MAKE A EIGHT LEASING UP ON PORTION FOR OUR PLAIN AN
GCPe2Za7JV8_3 AND SO AN AND YOU CAN USE THE BUTTONS JUST FOR A TOUCHY FEELEY SECTION
GCPe2Za7JV8_4 THAT WILL CAUSE THE BUTTONS AWAY FROM THE BUTTON FIVE
GCPe2Za7JV8_5 AND FOR THIS ONE I'M GOING TO TRIM JUST TRIM OFF THE EDGE AND WE'LL JUST SO THAT DOWN TO THE MAT
GCPe2Za7JV8_6 AND IT'S JUST KIND OF FUN THING TO TOUCH AND FEEL
GCPe2Za7JV8_7 AND THEN WHEN THE THE BUTTONHOLE PORTION I GOT TO EVEN IN THE TWO BUTTON FLYING BANGS AND I'M GONNA JUST TRY IT LEAVES UP SO THAT I HAVE ON THE BUTTON HOLES ON EITHER SIDE
GCPe2Za7JV8_8 AND WE'LL USE A CLAY IS TO IT SO THAT THE CHILD CAN PRACTICE IS LEASING <UNK>
GCPe2Za7JV8_9 SO TO PREPARE THIS KNEE THEM ON FLIES WITH BOTH HEADED IN THIS DIRECTION SO I REALLY WANTS THEN TO FACE EACH OTHER SO THEN BILL LACING IS MORE EASY AND I HAVE FOR BUTTON HOLES HERE THAT I HAVE FIVE HERE
GCPe2Za7JV8_10 SOME OF HOT OIL OFF THIS BOTTOM BUTTONHOLE
GCPe2Za7JV8_11 AND WILL DISCARD BAT
GCPe2Za7JV8_12 AND I'VE CUT IT OPEN SLIGHTLY HERE FOR THAT I CAN OPEN UP THE FLAP AND EXPOSE THE BUTTON HOLES
GCPe2Za7JV8_13 SOLE PETLAND DOWN IN THAT POSITION
GCPe2Za7JV8_14 AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE I'M GOING TO REMOVE THIS THIS FLAP IS UNDERNEATH
GCPe2Za7JV8_15 AGAIN I'VE CUT IT OFF AT THE TOP HERE
GCPe2Za7JV8_16 I'M IN A REMOVE THIS BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE DOWN IN THE BOTTOM YOU DON'T WANT IT TO GET IN THE WAY OF THE CHILD WHILE THEY'RE DOING THE LACING
GCPe2Za7JV8_17 SO JUST CUT THAT OFF AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN CLOSE AND WILT HITTING THIS DOWN AND WILL JUST BE TOP STITCHING THAT ALL SOME
GCPe2Za7JV8_18 AND NOW HITTING THIS IN PLACE WITH IT THE FLAP OPEN
GCPe2Za7JV8_20 YOU WANT TO PUT A COUPLE CANS IN THERE TO HOLD IT IN PLACE IF YOUR TOP STITCHING
GCPe2Za7JV8_21 AND THEN YOU CAN GET A NICE COLORFUL LADIES
GCPe2Za7JV8_22 AGAIN IT'S COLORFUL LATE
GCPe2Za7JV8_23 THE ONE MAKE SURE THAT IT HAS A LITTLE HARD AND THE ON IT
GCPe2Za7JV8_24 MAKES IT A LOT EASY FOR THOSE LITTLE FINGERS TO GET VIA THE LEAVES THROUGH THE HOLE AND THEN THE CHILD CAN LACE UP THROUGH ALL THESE NICE FUN HOLES

hBmSa12bSfQ_1 AND WHEN YOUR LISTENING TO SOMEONE SELF DISCLOSE YOU WANNA BE REAL CAREFUL TO LET THEM SET OF PACE
hBmSa12bSfQ_2 AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS MAYBE THEY WANTED REVEAL INFORMATION BRANCH FULLY A WAR OR MAYBE THEY NEED TO GET ALL THE INFORMATION OUT I'M
hBmSa12bSfQ_3 USUALLY IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND
hBmSa12bSfQ_4 IT'S AT YOU KNOW YOU FEEL LIKE OR HAVING BEEN DOWN PULL INFORMATION OUT OF THEM
hBmSa12bSfQ_5 BE OK WITH EVERYONE'S INDIVIDUAL LEVELS OF SELF DISCLOSURE
hBmSa12bSfQ_6 YOU DON'T EVER WANT A HEART ON SOMEBODY OR PICK ON SOMEBODY I'M GOING TO SOMEBODY OR HER RAFT SOMEBODY TO GET THE INFORMATION OUT
hBmSa12bSfQ_7 COME ON AND COUNTING COMING IN AND GET HIM IN THE INFORMATION I CAN'T WAITING WHY DON'T HAVE ANY MORE PATIENTS
hBmSa12bSfQ_8 SO I'M LAUGH THAT PERSON IS AT THE PACE AND DON'T EVALUATE ANY OF IT
hBmSa12bSfQ_9 DON'T IN VALUE WEIGHT SIMPLY UNDERSTAND
hBmSa12bSfQ_10 IF THE PERSON WHO IS AT A DISCLOSING INFORMATION JEAN ONCE THEY'RE OPINION I WANT YOU TO EVALUATE THE SITUATION THEY WILL ASK THE OTHERWISE YOUR JOB IS SIMPLY TO LISTEN AND BE EMPATHETIC
GiSBTBfnZUY_1 AND THE ENGINE THE PROJECT HAS BEEN AND REDUCE THE WINTER
GiSBTBfnZUY_2 IT IS PROBABLY HAVE TO SOME OF THE MOST IMPACT ON BEGIN THE CORNERS
GiSBTBfnZUY_3 GETTING STARTED IN THE CRAFT HAS BEEN TURNING PANS
GiSBTBfnZUY_4 AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THIS
GiSBTBfnZUY_5 FOR ONE THING IT'S PRETTY EASY TO GET IN AND TURNING WITHOUT SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY
GiSBTBfnZUY_6 HANDS ARE SMALL IS SO THEY CAN BE DOWN ON THE LATHE LIKE THAT
GiSBTBfnZUY_7 YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET A FULL SIZE LAYS
GiSBTBfnZUY_8 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPANIES THAT PRODUCE SMALL LAYS LIKE THIS THAT USUALLY RETAILER IN THE THREE HUNDRED RANGE
GiSBTBfnZUY_9 AN EXCELLENT LAY THAT YOU CAN DO A LOT OF WORK ON
GiSBTBfnZUY_10 AS FAR AS THE PENS GO THEY OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY TO FAIRLY QUICKLY MAKE A FINISHED PRODUCT PRODUCT THAT IS USEFUL THAT PEOPLE ENJOY AND IN THIS FUN TO MAKE
GiSBTBfnZUY_11 ANOTHER NICE THING ABOUT THE MOVES YOU GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH SOME REALLY REMARKABLE MATERIALS
GiSBTBfnZUY_12 WHETHER THAT THE KNEE OUT OF TRULY SPECTACULAR WOODS LIKE THIS BURL THAT HAS BEEN PARTIALLY DIED
GiSBTBfnZUY_13 THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLASTICS THAT ARE LABELED
GiSBTBfnZUY_14 GOOD HARDWOODS WITH EXOTIC IN AND HAVE WOODS
GiSBTBfnZUY_15 YOU CAN LAMINATE WOODS OUT LIKE THIS TO MAKE BLANKS OUT OF
GiSBTBfnZUY_16 AND EVEN HANDLER
GiSBTBfnZUY_17 MAKES A VERY NICE THIN
GiSBTBfnZUY_18 AND THEY'RE NUMBER OF OTHER MATERIALS THAT WOULD BE FOR MAKING BENDS OF
GiSBTBfnZUY_19 AND SO IT'S A GOOD WAY TO GET IN THE TURNING A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED WOODTURNING BY TURNING BENDS
HcMF3dG1AHg_2 I'M CHEF RAINER WICKEL AND I'M HERE TODAY WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
HcMF3dG1AHg_3 OUT GO WELL OR ONTO OUR NEXT STEP IN MAKING WIENERSCHNITZEL'S IN RIGHT NOW ARE AND BE GOING OVER THE INGREDIENTS THAN TO COMPLETE OUR FISH
HcMF3dG1AHg_4 OF COURSE WE NEED THE PORK CHOPS AND WE GET A NICE THAT ONES ARE IT HERE WHICH WE'RE GOING TO CUT OUT
HcMF3dG1AHg_5 WE ALSO NEED FLOUR FORGETTING WHEN THE BREAD CRUMBS IN MANY TO A <UNK>
HcMF3dG1AHg_6 NOW WE'RE IN OF WITH THE SEPARATELY IN THREE DIFFERENT BOWLS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DO IT THE SCHNITZELS IN THEM AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO FRY
HcMF3dG1AHg_7 THE BREAD CRUMBS BEING THE LAST THING THAT WE DID ON
HcMF3dG1AHg_8 OF COURSE I ALSO LIKE TO AND USE ROUTE HOWEVER IN SEA SALT WHICH IS A PERSONAL PREFERENCE LINE
HcMF3dG1AHg_9 NOW CATHERINE ASSAULT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE PUTTING INTO THE FLOUR MIXTURE BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO LINE WITH THE SCHNITZELS AND IT'S CAN GIVE IT THAT REALLY GOOD FLAVOR
HcMF3dG1AHg_10 OH I'M GONNA BE COOKING THE SCHNITZEL TODAY AND OLIVE OIL
HcMF3dG1AHg_11 NOW A USUALLY UP AND USUALLY WHEN COOKING SCHNITZELS ON IT YOU CAN EITHER COCOA IN OIL OR A USUALLY THE EQUIPMENT BONDER TOO BUT I'M CHOOSING ALL OVER THE BECAUSE IT'S A LOT HEALTHIER
HcMF3dG1AHg_12 IF YOU GO IN AND BOTHERS CAN BE EXTREMELY FAT MEAL
HcMF3dG1AHg_13 BUT THIS ALSO GIVES A LOT BETTER FLAVOR AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING WITH IT
HcMF3dG1AHg_14 LASTLY WE HAVE A ONE
HcMF3dG1AHg_15 OKAY THE LEMON IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE AT THE END WHEN RESURFACE SCHNITZELS
HcMF3dG1AHg_16 YOU ALWAYS PUT A SLICE ALONE IN ON TOP OF THAT BECAUSE THEN WHEN YOU'RE SERVING SCHNITZEL YOU TAKE THAT LATIN AND SQUEEZE THE LEMON JUICE ALL OVER THE SCHNITZEL AND IT GIVES IT THAT ADDITIONAL TANGY FLAVOR AND THESE ARE BASICALLY ALL THE INGREDIENTS AND WE NEED TO MAKE A WIENERSCHNITZEL'S
hahHzzWNo0w_1 HI
hahHzzWNo0w_2 I'M SARAH HAUER
hahHzzWNo0w_3 AND I'M SIG HAUER AND WE'RE PROFESSIONAL PRACTITIONERS OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE
hahHzzWNo0w_4 AND WE'RE HERE ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
hahHzzWNo0w_5 AND WELCOME TO OUR VIDEO
hahHzzWNo0w_6 PAINT IS THAT AREA WE'RE PROBABLY BEST KNOWN FOR
hahHzzWNo0w_7 TYPICALLY IN OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR PATIENTS COME FIRST BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT SOME COMPLAIN ABOUT PARTICULAR PAIN
hahHzzWNo0w_8 OF COURSE AS WE LEARN ABOUT A PATIENT PATIENT ACTUALLY LEARNS A FEW THINGS ABOUT THEMSELVES THEY FIND THAT OTHER THINGS THAT A GOOD BATTERS WE TREAT THEM ABOUT PAIN
hahHzzWNo0w_9 BUT CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND PAIN THAT THERE WE HAVE DONE VERY WELL WITH AND THEY'RE MORE THAN ONE ON ONE OF MENTION OF COURSE THE THINGS LIKE MIGRAINE HEADACHES LOW BACK PAIN NECK PAIN JUST ABOUT ANY KIND OF HEADACHE <UNK> ARTHRITIS
hahHzzWNo0w_10 TMJ OF
hahHzzWNo0w_11 IF IT HURTS WHEN WE CAN PROBABLY OUT WITH THAT HOME
hahHzzWNo0w_12 TYPICALLY WE SEE FOR EXAMPLE OF LOW BACK PAIN I SEE PEOPLE RESPONDING ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO ABOUT EIGHT TREATMENTS THAT THEY START RESPOND VERY WELL AND SHOW SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT
hahHzzWNo0w_13 OF ONE PARTICULAR CASE I CAN THINK OF WAS A GENTLEMAN ON ABOUT SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD OF RETIRED SCHOOL TEACHER OF I'M HAS BACK AND DRAWN OUNCE
hahHzzWNo0w_14 I USE VERY ACTIVE FLOW EXERCISE A LOT OF THE LAST STRETCHING SERVE USE PRICES BACK ONE OUT
hahHzzWNo0w_15 TO OF ONE TREATMENT
hahHzzWNo0w_16 GINA AND IT QUITE HONESTLY IT USUALLY TAKES A FEW TREATMENTS BUT THIS GENTLEMAN BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE SUCH GOOD CARE INSULTED OR PHYSICALLY FIT ONE TREATMENT HE RESPONDED VERY WELL AND THE BACK PAIN WAY AND DID NOT REOCCUR AFTER THAT
GQefb82rktc_1 ONE OF THE EYE INTERESTING THINGS THAT I FOUND WITH WATERCOLOR
GQefb82rktc_2 MY DEGREE IS IN DRAWING AN I'M VERY GOOD AT DRAWING BUT IT ALSO TAKES A LOT OF TIME
GQefb82rktc_3 AND THE MORE TIME IT TAKES TO PAINT A PAINTING THE LESS INCOME BASICALLY
GQefb82rktc_4 SO THE REASON I USE A PROJECTOR AND PROJECT THE IMAGE IS TO GET A LOT OF DETAIL IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME SO I CAN FOCUS ON THE PAINTING
GQefb82rktc_5 AND AS YOU'LL SEE ON THIS THE ON THIS PIECE HERE WHICH I'VE ALREADY LAID OUT THERE'S A NUMBER OF VERY INTRICATE DETAILS ON THIS THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MEAN EXTRAORDINARY EXTRAORDINARILY LONG TIME TO ACTUALLY PAINT
GQefb82rktc_6 SO AS AN EXAMPLE OF BRIDLE ON THIS HORSE
GQefb82rktc_7 THIS YOUNG LADIES MOTHER ACTUALLY MADE IT BY HAND
GQefb82rktc_8 THIS IS BEAD WORK
GQefb82rktc_9 AND ALL OF THE V ON THE LEATHER WORK AND STUFF
GQefb82rktc_10 PEOPLE KNOW WHEN THAT'S IN CORRECT IF YOU DO THAT THEY KNOW OF ANY THINGS OUT OF PLACE WITH THE ANIMAL
GQefb82rktc_11 ANYTHING LIKE THAT
GQefb82rktc_12 SO BY PROJECTING YOUR IMAGE AND GETTING ALL THE TIGHT DETAIL GETTING THE EYES PERFECT GETTING THE PERSPECTIVE PERFECT
GQefb82rktc_13 THAT TAKES SOME OF THE WEIGHT OFF OF GETTING THE DRAWING RIGHT
GQefb82rktc_14 YOU CAN FOCUS MORE ON THE PAINTING
GQefb82rktc_15 YOU CAN EXPERIMENT MORE WITH TECHNIQUES AND YOU CAN CREATE MORE PAINTINGS THEN YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO OTHER LENGTH

H-JhEXmhK2U_6 THESE ARE THE STANDING SPOTS YOU'LL NOTICE THESE ARE A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN THE REGULAR IN SIZE PADS
H-JhEXmhK2U_7 I LIKE THESE WERE DOING THESE KIND OF PROJECTS BUT THEY ALSO COME IN THE LARGER ON STANDARD SIZE STAMPING PAD

gKnp9YoayJY_1 HI I'M MELINA AND WELCOME TO EXPERT VILLAGE
gKnp9YoayJY_2 HEY I'M AND SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A BEAUTIFUL NECKLACE OUT OF POLYMER CLAY
gKnp9YoayJY_3 IN THIS NEXT THAT WE'RE GOING TO ADD A CLOSURE TO OUR NECKLACE
gKnp9YoayJY_4 THE FLOOR ADDING ANY CLOSURES PED TO KNEAD AND THE BEATS
gKnp9YoayJY_5 AND FEEDS AFTER THE BEST INVENTION IN THE WORLD IN MY OPINION
gKnp9YoayJY_6 IS A GREAT WAY TO SEE OFF ANY NECKLACE TO PREVENT THE CLOSURES FROM LOOSENING TO HOLD EVERYTHING IN PLACE AND THEY'RE REALLY EASY TO APPLY
gKnp9YoayJY_7 ANYBODY CAN DO IT ALL YOU NEED IS A PAIR OF NEEDLE NOSE PLIERS
gKnp9YoayJY_8 <UNK> RELIEVE THERE'S OUR WIRE HER
gKnp9YoayJY_9 SOME WIRES CAN COME OUT OF THE THIGH AND IF I AM GOING TO TEST THE WIRE TO A CLOSURE
gKnp9YoayJY_10 IF A HALF OF THE OTHER END OF THE WIRE IS GONNA COME BACK INSIDE OF THE CRIMP BEAD

G9iDjvQL_mQ_1 OKAY THE NEXT LEVEL WHEN IT'S ALL ABOUT SCORING OR YOUR POINT SO YOUR BOWLS THING TO MOVE FORWARD SO EVENTUALLY SINK THE EIGHT OHM AND AGAIN
G9iDjvQL_mQ_2 ART SCORING OCCURS WHEN YOU MAY DURABLE WHETHER THE THE STRIPES ARE SOLID
G9iDjvQL_mQ_3 WE KNOW THAT IF YOU MAKE A LEGAL SHOT YOU GETS IS FOR GANG AND GET AND THIN YOU TO KEEP PLAYING SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A SCENARIO ON STRIPES IN THIS TWO BALLS LEFT ONSLOW SHOOTING I CAN DO SOMETHING REICHLE THE TWELVE WILL IN THE COOL OFF AND JUST OPTIC YOU WILL BE A PUSH UP AGAIN THESE OF THE EDGE OF LAND PULL IT IN HALF ALARM POSITIONING AND <UNK> AND THIS IS A <UNK> WHICH IS LEARNING ABOUT THE STRATEGY OF THE GAME IN CHINA WHEN AGAIN WHAT OFF I WOULD MAKE IT'S WELL IT'S AN AND NOW ALL MARBLES OR OUR DAWN
G9iDjvQL_mQ_4 NOW I'M AN CONTENTION TO WINNING THE GAME
G9iDjvQL_mQ_5 AGAIN SLOWING THE BOLT IS WHEN YOU LEGALLY POT GET ALL OF YOUR BOWLS WHETHER THEY BE THE STRIPES HELL THE SOLIDS
G9iDjvQL_mQ_6 DON'T GET STORING CONFUSED POINTS
G9iDjvQL_mQ_7 SCORING JUST MEANS THAT YOU HAVE IT ALL THE WHOLE THE SEVEN HOLES IN THE STRIPES ALL THE SEVEN HOLES IN THE SOLIDS
G9iDjvQL_mQ_8 SO IT DOES MIGHT BE IS AN AREA WHERE ACTUAL GLUTTONY A
G9iDjvQL_mQ_9 I'M TRYING TO GET AT EIGHT BOLT IS THAT YOU WHEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE A LEGAL SHOT
G9iDjvQL_mQ_10 LIMIT DESTROY THE ILLEGAL SHOT THAT WOULD MAKE HERE ON THE TWELVE AND ON ITS ANGLE OF THE SHOTS
G9iDjvQL_mQ_11 I WOULD SAY SOME LIKED WOBBLE IN THE CORNER POCKET WHICH I WOULD MAKE OF AND THEN OUT I WOULD NOT MYSELF IN A POSITION YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TRY TO PLAY POSITION IT'S ANOTHER VIDEO TAPE CLOVES WHAT TYPE OF MYSELF IN SUCH A POSITION THAT LIKE IT PLATE GOBLETS HANDLE IN THIS HOLE ON OUR <UNK> AND MAKE MY CAN WILL COME OUT FOR GOOD POSITIONING SHOT FOR THE EIGHT BALL AND WIN THE GAME
G9iDjvQL_mQ_12 SIDE IT'S EXAMPLE ON THE CORNER OF HIM ON AND YOU SEE THE CUE BALL COMES OUT TO A POSITION ON THE TABLE WHERE I HAVE A NICE SHOT AN ANGLE SHOT FOR THE EIGHT BALL ON THE CORNER
G9iDjvQL_mQ_13 THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO ONE POT IN YOUR POOLS LEGALLY AND SCORING L OF YOUR GOALS FOR OURS BEFORE YOUR OPPONENT DOES HAVE A GIVEN YOU A GOOD EXECUTION SHOT FOR WINNING THE GAME AND SHOOTING THE EIGHT BOWLING CLEAN
gT5Su9TcfGI_1 BID WHIST WITH KITTY AND JOKERS
gT5Su9TcfGI_2 THE ROOTS OF BID WHIST OF COURSE THE BACK TO THE ORIGINAL GAME WAS THAT WAS CREATED IN THE LATE SIXTEEN HUNDREDS EARLY SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS AND I'VE WRITTEN EXTENSIVELY BY EDMAN HOYLE GAMES CLAY AND OTHERS
gT5Su9TcfGI_3 DON'T CLAY WAS A CARD YOU MIGHT OF FROM THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS AND YOU WOULD A COMPLETE TREATISE ON ON BID WHIST IN WHIST IN GENERAL OF ANYTHING SIXTY FOR
gT5Su9TcfGI_4 UP UNTIL ABOUT NINETEEN TWENTY THE GAME OF WAYS THAT WAS PLAYED WAS PRETTY STANDARD
gT5Su9TcfGI_5 AND THE DETERMINATION FROM FOR EXAMPLE WAS NOT BY BIDDING BUT WAS BY THE BOTTOM CARD
gT5Su9TcfGI_6 SO IF THE HAND IS DEALT OUT THE CLAY OK THAT'S TRUMP
gT5Su9TcfGI_7 WELL WHAT WAS VERY FRUSTRATING AS YOU PICK UP A BEAUTIFUL HAND THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS
gT5Su9TcfGI_8 I MEAN YOU MAY NOT HAVE TWELVE HEARTS
gT5Su9TcfGI_9 IT WHICH IS SAY YOU HAVE A NICE KILLER HIDE SUIT FOR EXAMPLE IN SOME SIDE ACES
gT5Su9TcfGI_10 BUT THE DECK SAYS RESTAURANT
gT5Su9TcfGI_11 WHERE'S THE SKILLS
gT5Su9TcfGI_12 I MEAN IT IS THAT CAN COMPLETELY WORK OUT OF A GREAT HAND LIKE THAT
gT5Su9TcfGI_13 SO THEY DECIDED TO HAVE BIDDING
gT5Su9TcfGI_14 AND WHAT CAME OUT OF THAT WAS THE AFTER MENTIONS STRAIT WHIST
gT5Su9TcfGI_15 NOW ABOUT NINETEEN TWENTY OF SO ON A GROOVE WILL PLAY IS PRIMARILY IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY DECIDED TO INNOVATE AGAIN A LITTLE BIT AND AND ON THE FACT THAT WE CAN MAKE THIS GAME TO JAZZ THIS UP A LITTLE BIT
gT5Su9TcfGI_16 MAKE THIS A LOT MORE FUN MAKE THIS A LOT MORE COMPETITIVE
gT5Su9TcfGI_17 SO THEN THEY ADDED JOKERS
gT5Su9TcfGI_18 JOKERS WE'RE ALWAYS AROUND IN THE DECK AND JOKERS INTERNAL WE TALKED ABOUT IN EUCHRE DUKER JOKER AND SO FORTH AND WAS ADDED TO THE DECK BY BICYCLE CARDS
gT5Su9TcfGI_19 US FIND ON COME ABOUT EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
gT5Su9TcfGI_20 IF YOU LOOK AT A TYPICAL DECK OF CARDS YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE IS A BIG JOKER AND A LITTLE JOKER
gT5Su9TcfGI_21 NOW SOME OF THE CUSTOM SPADES THAT'S THAT BICYCLE MAKES HAPPEN TO HAVE A NICE BIG THINGS IS A BIG JOKER LITTLE JOKER BUT THESE OVALS FINE
gT5Su9TcfGI_22 YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS ONE ON A BICYCLE IS BIGGER THAN THIS ONE
gT5Su9TcfGI_23 IS THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE DIFFERENT FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BID WHIST AND STRAIT WHIST IS THE FACT THAT A YOU HAVE JOKERS THAT UP TOP
gT5Su9TcfGI_24 THE BIG JOKER IS BIGGER THAN THE ACE OF SPADES AND IS BIGGER THAN THE LITTLE JOKER
gT5Su9TcfGI_25 THE LITTLE JOKER SUPERSEDES OR BIGGER THAN THE ACES THEY BEGIN THE ACE OF TRUMP
gT5Su9TcfGI_26 SO WE WOULD LOOK AT A TRUMP SUIT THAT WAS UPTOWN WE WOULD SEE THAT IS THE RANKING
gT5Su9TcfGI_27 BIG JOKER LITTLE DARKER ACE KING QUEEN AND SO FORTH
gT5Su9TcfGI_28 SO THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO OF THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A JOKER IN A KITTY
gT5Su9TcfGI_29 A LOT OF HISTORY THAT SERVING GOES BACK TO THE NINETEEN TWENTIES THIRTIES FORTIES WITH THESE IN IT'S PLAYED HUGE THAT WAS COMMUNITY
gT5Su9TcfGI_30 IT WAS MEANING WITH GETTING JOKERS AND SO FORTH
gT5Su9TcfGI_31 ANOTHER ASPECT IS THAT IT IS THE SAME COMMUNITY OF AFRICAN AMERICAN PLAYERS WHO ALSO CREATED THE GAME OF SPADES
gT5Su9TcfGI_32 SO YOU HAVE BID WHIST WITH KITTY AND JOKERS IN SPADES
gT5Su9TcfGI_33 VERY POPULAR IN THE LATE THIRTY THROUGHOUT SETTLE MORE WAR AND THEN FROM THERE AND WENT IN THE COLLEGES AND ON OTHER PLACES
gT5Su9TcfGI_34 PEOPLE ALWAYS HAVE A GREAT TIME WITH AGAIN
gT5Su9TcfGI_35 GREAT RICH HISTORY
GbfVUIaWAew_1 THE FIRST THING YOU'RE GONNA DO IN THE ACRYLIC APPLICATION IS JUST GO AHEAD AND WHAT ARE BRUSH TO ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONOMER ON THERE

GbfVUIaWAew_19 JUST KIND OF THE LANDED AND WITH THE REST
GbfVUIaWAew_20 NOT IS HOW YOU APPLY THE ACRYLIC OFF TO THE RIGHT HUMAN HEALTH
GbfVUIaWAew_21 AGAIN IF YOUR ACRYLIC IS TO LET IT WILL RUN IN TRIP YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF AND START OVER
GLj7QwlHIKI_1 THE NEXT KNOT ORGAN AND TIE IS THE ALRIGHT NOT AN ITEM
GLj7QwlHIKI_2 THIS NON IS USED FOR FINE TOGETHER LIKE FISHING LINES AND WHATNOT OF THE DIFFERENT DIAMETER
GLj7QwlHIKI_3 TO START YOU TAKE THE LARGER WINE AND CREATE A LOOP AND ANY TAKE OFF THE SMALLER LIFE AND RUN IT THROUGH THIS WAY AWAY FROM THIS AND THE MOVE MOVE MOVE
GLj7QwlHIKI_4 ANY SIMPLY TAKE IT OUT AND BEGIN WRAPPING AROUND
GLj7QwlHIKI_5 YOU WANT TO DO THIS SEVERAL TIMES LIKE AN EIGHT OR NINE
GLj7QwlHIKI_6 THIS THIS IS FOR OF HIS LEFT BIGGER THAN WHAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY USE IS NOT FOR OFF ON THE SKIN AND IT A FEW TIMES TO GET THE IDEA

GLj7QwlHIKI_9 AND FINISH IT OFF AND GO OVER THE TOP YOU NOTICE HOW THESE ARE COMING OVER THIS WAY SIMILAR TO THE WAY THAT THIS WE'RE NOT WOOD
GLj7QwlHIKI_10 AND YOU JUST PULL IT DOWN INSIDE ABOUT
GLj7QwlHIKI_11 NOT THE ALRIGHT
GGM9IPA8lzM_1 NEAR EDITING FOR YOU ON MAKE SURE THE TEETH THIS IN
GGM9IPA8lzM_2 PUSH INTO WHAT HE DID IF THE FILLS UP BEHIND IT
GGM9IPA8lzM_3 IF THE FIN LOW CRACKING ANYONE TRYING TO FILL IT UP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
GGM9IPA8lzM_4 THAT COMES INTO HUNTINGTON'S LITERALLY <UNK>
GGM9IPA8lzM_5 BRING HAS IS GO RULE AND LEAVE IT ON THE HAND
GGM9IPA8lzM_6 FILLING IN WITH RUNNING A CRACK CLUES HUMAN HAIR IF FOR HERZING <UNK>
GGM9IPA8lzM_7 IF THE ENDS BRINGS THE VISITS CAN HARDLY IF MOVE THE HEAT WORKING WITH IT IF IT HEALTH FOR EASY TO YOU'LL HAVE INTO THE FLAVOR YOU THIS HALF NOTE ON OUR LISTENING
GGM9IPA8lzM_8 HALF HANNAH LIKE THE NEW MY CLIENT LIKE THE ONE SIDE AT A TIME FROM WHAT USING WITH FORTY MANY IN NINETEEN IN IT AND IF I CAN DO IT IS AND THE OF OUT HE BELIEVED QUARTER TROUT NINETY SOMETIMES WITH A LOT OF TIMES I DON'T SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY JUST ENOUGH FIX A LOT OF TIME FOR ME TO STOP AND GRAB A CLIMB EVEN START USING AND ALL THAT
GGM9IPA8lzM_9 IT IS FASTER FOR ME TO GO BY HAND

HEXxfkdN5kc_2 WELCOME TO EXPERT VILLAGE
HEXxfkdN5kc_3 MY NAME IS WAYNE PETERSON AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE IMPORTANT BIRD AREAS PROGRAM FOR THE MASSACHUSETTS AUDUBON SOCIETY
HEXxfkdN5kc_4 TODAY WE'RE HERE AT THE DANIEL WEBSTER WILDLIFE SANCTUARY IN MARSHFIELD
HEXxfkdN5kc_5 WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT BIRDING BY EAR
HEXxfkdN5kc_6 IN ADDITION TO SONGS AND CALL NOTES WHICH ARE VOCAL RENDITIONS VARIOUS BIRD SPECIES ALSO MAKE MECHANICAL SOUNDS
HEXxfkdN5kc_7 SOUNDS THAT ACTUALLY DON'T INVOLVE ANY KIND OF OF PHYSICAL VOCALIZATION
HEXxfkdN5kc_8 THE DRUMMING OF A WOODPECKER ON A HOLLOW SNAG FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE OF THING
HEXxfkdN5kc_9 BUT THEY'RE OTHERS
HEXxfkdN5kc_10 FOR INSTANCE SAUT VARIOUS BIRDS ESPECIALLY SHORE BIRDS OFTEN GIVE DISPLAYS IN THE AIR WHERE THE SOUND PASSING THROUGH VARIOUS PARTS OF EITHER THEIR WINGS OR THEIR TAILS CAN PRODUCE PECULIAR SOUNDS
HEXxfkdN5kc_11 THE AMERICAN WOODCOCK FOR EXAMPLE IS A BIRD IT WHEN IT TAKES OFF IT HAS THIS OF SOFTWARE DURING SOUND WHICH IS ACTUALLY MADE BY AIR PASSING THROUGH THE OUTER FLIGHT FEATHERS
HEXxfkdN5kc_12 SIMILARLY THE WILSON SNIPE WHEN IT'S DISPLAYING SPREADS ITS TAIL IN FLIGHT AND BASICALLY DOES A BRIEF FREEFALL WHICH CREATES THIS VERY PECULIAR WHEN DOING SOUND
HEXxfkdN5kc_13 SOME OF THE ODD GAME BIRD SOME OF THE CHICKEN LIKE BIRDS WILL OFTEN DISPLAY AND THEY'LL TAP THEIR FEET ON THE GROUND OUT IN ADDITION TO MAKING VARIOUS GESTURES WITH THEIR WINGS THAT ARE OUR INTERESTING IN THIS REGARD
HEXxfkdN5kc_14 SO THERE ARE LOTS OF SOUNDS OTHER THAN STRICT VOCALIZATION IS THAT CAN BE USED FOR SOME OF THE SAME FUNCTIONS THAT WE FIND IN TERMS OF TRUE SONGS AND CALLS

HK7a25sxpbw_1 OKAY NOW IN THIS SHOWY HAT IS THE T USING AN DIFFUSING LAW
HK7a25sxpbw_2 OFF AND IN THIS ISN'T A BALL THAT TRADITIONALLY THIS TYPE OF APPARATUS WAS IN A ROUND SHAPE
HK7a25sxpbw_3 SO BASICALLY THIS IS A GREAT TOOL IF YOU DISCONNECT ONE CUP OF TEA FOR YOURSELF
HK7a25sxpbw_4 AND IT'S BASICALLY THIS AND MASH LITTLE HOPPER THAT THE TEA IS IN AND THEN THE LID SCREWS ON IT THAT IS CUT THIS GREAT LITTLE CHAIN AND YOU CAN HANG IT INTO THE CUP AND WRAP THE CHAIN AROUND THE HANDLE THE HOUSE AND PULL IT OUT WITH WHEN YOU'RE DONE
HK7a25sxpbw_5 SO FOR THE AS AN ESCAPE USE ON WHEN IT REALLY MAKES AND GREEN TEA AND DOWN AND MEASURE OUT MY OF ONE TEASPOON OF GREEN TEA SINCE WE'RE ONLY BY MAKING ONE CUP AND AND PUT IT IN THE <UNK>
HK7a25sxpbw_6 SO THERE'S MINTY INSIDE AND THEN A SCREWED ON IN IN MAY LOOK LIKE THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT SEE IN A LOT IN THE SPACING IN NOT TO CAKE IS WHAT LOOSE AND HE NEEDS IS BASE FOR THE LEAVES TO REALLY EXPAND ON AS THEY TAKE ON WATER
HK7a25sxpbw_7 AND SO THAT'S IT THAT THAT CREATES THAT AT A TEA IN A BAG DOESN'T REALLY OFFERS EXTRA SPACE FOR TO MOVE AROUND
HK7a25sxpbw_8 AS YOU SCREW THE LID ON
HK7a25sxpbw_9 SINCE WE'RE DOING GREENS YOU'VE GOT WATER THAT SET OF OILY IT'S A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN BOILING
HK7a25sxpbw_10 RIGHT TO BOILING LIQUID LITTLE BIT
HK7a25sxpbw_11 ITS OWN FILL UP ONE CUP WORTH OF WATER IN LOVE AND THEN SUBMERGE <UNK> THE DIFFUSING BALL INSIDE THE CUT
HK7a25sxpbw_12 IN GET MOST OF THESE HAVE A LITTLE A LITTLE HOOK RIGHT HERE SO THAT YOU CAN WRAP THE CHAIN AROUND THE HANDLE AND THEN WHAT BEYOND ITSELF SO IT CHANGES AND FALL AND YOU HAVE
HK7a25sxpbw_13 SO SUNSCREEN HERE LET IT SIT FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES AND THEN ONCE IT'S FINISHED WHEN YOU PULL ON ONE ON ONE HUNDRED WAS DRAIN
HK7a25sxpbw_14 I CAN OPEN IT DISCARD MIGHT USE TEA LEAVES AND THEN WITH RINSE IT OUT IN ENJOYMENT OF TEA
_HGmlDEpq_g_1 HI MY NAME IS LAUREN WITH MAKEUP BY DODGE AND TODAY WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO MAKE YOUR FACE LOOK FADER USING MAKEUP
_HGmlDEpq_g_2 AND THAT ARE A LOT OF YOU LADIES ONE TO KNOW HOW TO DO THIS AND IT'S VERY EASY
_HGmlDEpq_g_3 SO FIRST YOU NEED TO FIND CONTOURING MAKEUP
_HGmlDEpq_g_4 CONTRARY MAKEUP SOMEONE CALL IT BRONZER
_HGmlDEpq_g_5 I PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE BRONZER BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT ON REALLY HAS REDDER ORANGE TONES IN THEIR SKIN UNLESS THEY HAVE A DARKER COMPLEXION BUT US LIGHT LIGHT LIGHT A WAS PIGMENTED PIGMENT WITH LADIES HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE BROWN
_HGmlDEpq_g_6 SO I'LL TAKE THIS COLOR WHICH IS JUST A LITTLE BROWN AND WITNESSED SWEEP IT UNDERNEATH THE CHEEKBONES AND ON THE RIM OF THE FACE BY THE HAIRLINE AND BRING IT OUT TOWARDS THE CENTER OF THE FACE
_HGmlDEpq_g_7 THIS CONTOURING MAKEUP IS POWDER SHOULD ONLY BE PUT ON WHEN YOU'VE POWDER YOUR FACE ALREADY OR ELSE IT'S GOING TO BE BLOTCHY FROM THE FOUNDATION AND HIS LITTLE CALMNESS
_HGmlDEpq_g_8 THE POINT OF THIS IS LIKE I SAID BEFORE IT'S GOING TO MAJOR I THINK THAT IT'S RECESSING THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY EXIST AS CLOSE TO THE SURFACE AS IT REALLY DOES AND IF YOU PUT A LITTLE HIGHLIGHT IN THE CENTER OF THE FACE THAT'LL BRING THE CENTER OUT AND THE EDGES BACK TO YOUR FACE WITH US WITH A LITTLE THINNER THAN IT REALLY IS
gcj62_Y5fHA_1 OKAY OUR NEXT I'LL SHOT ARE ON OUR THREE MOST BASIC HUG CUE BALL POSITION SHOT IS THE STOCK SHOT
gcj62_Y5fHA_2 AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF AN ACTION DO WE NEED TO HAVE ON THE CUE BALL ON CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT BALL IN ORDER TO GET IT TO STOP
gcj62_Y5fHA_3 AND I'M JUST GOING VALUE WHAT YOU WON'T BE LOOKING FOR ON EVERY STOP SHOT REGARDLESS OF DISTANCE IS YOU WANT TO BE TRYING TO CATCH THE CUE BALL IN ITS LIE
gcj62_Y5fHA_4 IN OTHER WORDS THAT'S THE ACTION THAT WE REALLY WANT ON THE CUE BALL IS NO ACTION AND ALL
gcj62_Y5fHA_5 WE DON'T WANT IT HAVE ANY EXCESS FORWARD ROLL WE DON'T WOULDN'T HAVE ANY EXCESS BACKS ENTERS I'VE BEEN OR ANYTHING ELSE
gcj62_Y5fHA_6 WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS SLIDE INTO THAT BALL
gcj62_Y5fHA_7 BECAUSE OF ITS SLIDES STRAIGHT INTO THE OBJECT BALL WHICH COULD HAPPEN IS THE CUE BALL THE ANY IMPART ALL OF ITS ENERGY TO THE OBJECT BALL SENDING THE OBJECT BALL ON ITS WAY IN THE CUE BALL THE LOSE EVERYTHING HAS GOT ROOM FOR IN ITS THOSE STOPPED AND STUFF
gcj62_Y5fHA_8 SO FROM THIS POSITION RIGHT HERE IN ORDER TO SLIDE THIS BALL FROM THERE THERE IT SHOULD BE A SIMPLE MATTER OF HITTING IT RIGHT AT THE CENTER
gcj62_Y5fHA_9 BECAUSE WHEN HEATED THE CENTER THAT'S WHEN IT'S FROM SLIDING
gcj62_Y5fHA_10 AND ON THE FAST CLOTH LIKE THIS IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE HIT RIGHT IN THE CENTER AND SLIDE ALL THE WAY OVER THAT I HAVE AND STOP
gcj62_Y5fHA_11 THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR
gcj62_Y5fHA_12 SLIDING ACTION FOR A STOCK SHOW
gpc-T2dm5Tk_1 BECAUSE WE HAVE A LAYER OF LEWINSOHN STICKING IT FROM THE BACK SIDE OF THE BUTTERFLY NEXT AND IT CAN CONTINUOUSLY PICK IT UP OFF THE SURFACE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT IF I'M CREATING A BOND WITH THE TABLE OF THE TABLE OF THE TABLE CLOTH
gpc-T2dm5Tk_2 SO I KEEP MAKING SURE THAT I CAN TO GET OUT OF ITS DRYING AS LEVER THROUGH THE REST OF THE PROJECT AND WE'RE JUST ABOUT READY TO ATTACH THE PIPE CLEANER BODY
gpc-T2dm5Tk_3 THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU COULD MAKE THE BODY AT IT
gpc-T2dm5Tk_4 IF YOU HAVE TIN FOIL AND DON'T HAVE A PIPE CLEANER YOU COULD DO THAT ON AND BASICALLY DOES WHEN CREATE A THEME SHAPE
gpc-T2dm5Tk_5 WHAT WE'LL DO NOW IS ATTACH IT WITH A STAPLER ANY GOOD THAT ATTACH THE TENT TIN FOIL WITH A STAPLER AS WELL
gpc-T2dm5Tk_6 LEATHER NOW IS BRING IT IN AND WE WANT TO CATCH IT RIGHT HERE ON HAVE WHAT BETWEEN THE HEAD AND THE BODY WITH THE FULL
gpc-T2dm5Tk_7 SO WE JUST IN A GOING LIKE THIS AND WE ALSO ONE AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S TABLE IS GOING TO CATCH ON THE CONSTRUCTION PAPER AND NOT THE TISSUE PAPER
gpc-T2dm5Tk_8 THERE'S THE FIRST PART OF OUR ATTACHMENT TOUGH
gpc-T2dm5Tk_9 AND THEN MAKING SURE THAT THE BUTTERFLY AS FLAT AND THE BODY IS FLAT AND HOPEFULLY COMES RIGHT TO THE ON EDGE OF THE CONSTRUCTION PAPER WITH AND BRINGS DAIGLER AND AGAIN AND GO IN AND AN ANGLE AND ATTACH IT THERE
gpc-T2dm5Tk_10 THIS GIVES US THE ATTACH BODY ON TO THE WINGS
GO0V4ZGSF28_1 ALRIGHT I'M STILL TALKING ABOUT SPONTANEITY BUT WHAT AREN'T TALK ABOUT NOW IS YOUR AUDIENCE AND YOUR AUDIENCE IS PERSET SHANNON OF WHETHER YOU ARE BEING SPONTANEOUS OR NOT
GO0V4ZGSF28_2 MEANING ARGUE BEING CONVERSATIONAL OR NOT
GO0V4ZGSF28_3 IT ISN'T TEND TO RESIZE YOUR SPEECH BY WROTE AND WHAT THAT MEANS IT IS YOU'VE PRACTICED IT SO MINUS YOU SET IT IN THE SHOWER IN THE CAR IN USUALLY TO YOUR FRIENDS TO YOUR MOM TO EVERYBODY IN OF AND SO YOU'RE JUST GETTING IT OUT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT SO WELL THE AUDIENCE IS CAN BE AWARE OF THAT
GO0V4ZGSF28_4 WHAT IT'S AN A COME ACROSS LIKE IS THAT YOU HAVE MEMORIZED YOUR SPEECH
GO0V4ZGSF28_5 AND WHEN YOU'VE MEMORIZE TO SPEECH YOU ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT WORDS COME NEXT
GO0V4ZGSF28_6 I'M PULLING NOT TO MEMORIZE LINES ON NOT THINKING ABOUT WHAT I'M SAYING
GO0V4ZGSF28_7 ACTORS CAN DO THAT PUBLIC SPEAKERS CAN NOT
GlzGBHkMXWI_1 MY NAME IS RICHARD GOMS WE'RE IN MURRAY UTAH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BASIC CAR CARE
GlzGBHkMXWI_2 MEANT TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW ROTORS WORK ON A CAR
GlzGBHkMXWI_3 ROTORS USUALLY APPEAR ON THE FRONT OF A CAR AND ARE USED FOR BREAKING
GlzGBHkMXWI_4 NEWER CARS YOU HAVE ROTORS IN THE BACK
GlzGBHkMXWI_5 THE ROTOR APPEARS ON THE ON THE WHEEL AND IT TURNS MEASURE GOING DOWN THE WROTE THEN WHEN YOU PUT ON THE BRAKES HYDRAULIC FLUID IS PUSHED THROUGH THIS LINE INTO THE CALIPER
GlzGBHkMXWI_6 THE CALIPER THEN PUTS PRESSURE ON BRAKE PADS SUCH AS THIS IS THE BRAKE PAD AND THAT PRESSURE THEN PUSHES ON THE ROTOR AND APPLY STOPPING POWER TO THAT ROTOR
GlzGBHkMXWI_7 ON MANY OF THE BRAKE PADS ARE USUALLY LITTLE FEELER GAUGE AND THAT FEEL OR GAUGE WHEN THE BRAKES GET TOO LOW WILL START DRAGGING ON THE ROTOR AND WHEN YOU HEAR THAT LITTLE NOISE AND IT STARTS WHEN YOU START BACKING UP IT'LL MAKE A NOISE AND WHEN YOU HIT HER HEARING THAT NOISE YOU'LL KNOW THAT THE BRAKES NEED TO BE REPLACED
GMZ10eQZCPA_1 KING AND BACK AND WE AND NINETEEN <UNK> AND ALLOW HARM HONEY HAWAIIAN GO
GMZ10eQZCPA_2 <UNK> AT <UNK>
GMZ10eQZCPA_3 OKAY WHAT IT IS IS ON THE ONE AND TAKE A HIGH AND ONE AND CUT IT IN HALF AND ONE AND REMOVE THE SEAT

GMZ10eQZCPA_8 IT ADDS AND THEN APPLY HAS LOTS OF ENZYMES IN A
GMZ10eQZCPA_9 ON IT THAT HOW MUCH ON THE HONEY
GMZ10eQZCPA_10 AND YOU CAN PUT END OF THAT SAY ABOUT THREE TABLESPOON <UNK> OR

GMZ10eQZCPA_14 AND EVEN AND A LIMITED RINGS HE IF YOU'D LIKE
GMZ10eQZCPA_15 IT'S A REALLY NICE AND TIGHT INFLAMMATORY THAT ALSO IS FULLY IN MASS
GMZ10eQZCPA_16 THE THE HIGH HAT UNNATURAL EXFOLIATING ENZYMES ON THAT HOLE TO REMOVE THE DEAD MATTER FROM SKIN RESISTING REALLY NICE LOW AND IT HELPS OF THE FRONT ENTRY MORE EFFECTIVELY PULSES FINE LINES AND WRINKLES

GMZ10eQZCPA_19 OKAY FELL ONLY IN BACK OR ANYTHING HOT SET UP THE FLOOR AND IF THE CORRECT WAY
h7NdXDJfE1k_1 THEN DISCUSS WITH YOU AT THE PROS AND CONS WEARING COLOR CONTEXT
h7NdXDJfE1k_2 OBVIOUSLY THE PRO IS I'M CHANGING MY OUT A COLOR ON CHANGE IN MY OPINION IT'S ON AND DOING SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT USELTON IN THE YOU MAY CONSIDER TO BE FASHIONABLE
h7NdXDJfE1k_3 THE OTHER PRO IS SOME PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME SEEM A CONTACT LENS WITH A PRINTED IT OR FOR DROPS THEY CAN'T SEE IT
h7NdXDJfE1k_4 IF YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS BAD ENOUGH NEW TO CLEAR CONTACT LENSES DON'T CUT IT SO THE COLOR ACTUALLY HELPS YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE THE CONTACT LENS IN IS A NEW IS IN RELATION TO YOUR EYE IS EVEN BE EASY TO PUT IT
h7NdXDJfE1k_5 THE CONS PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT THIS BUT LIKE I SAID BEFORE IT'S THE OF THE SIZE OF THE SIZE CAN BE LIMITING YOU KNOW
h7NdXDJfE1k_6 THE THE MAJOR DISTRIBUTOR OF CONTACT OF COLOR CONTACT LENSES IN THE WORLD ONLY HAS ONE SIZE OF CONTACT LENS AND IT'S LARGE
h7NdXDJfE1k_7 WHEN TO TAKE HERE IN HOE COVER YOUR WHOLE EYE
h7NdXDJfE1k_8 SO IT COULD BE SOME UNNECESSARY MOVEMENT A KNEE NOT FEEL VERY GOOD IN IN IN SOME PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO LIVE WITH THAT'S THEY COULD HAVE COLOR CONTACTS
h7NdXDJfE1k_9 THE OTHER THING IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS IF IT DOESN'T FIT PROPERLY THE CONTACT LENS MOVES AROUND WHICH HENCE BRINGS THE COLOR INTO LINE OF SIGHT SO NOT SEEN IS CLEARLY IS YOU WOULD WITH A CLEAR CONTACT LENSES
h7NdXDJfE1k_10 OR MAYBE HE DIDN'T NEEDED PRESCRIPTION WITHOUT ANY CONTACT LENSES AT ALL
h7NdXDJfE1k_11 IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT PURCHASING COUNT COLORED CONTACT LENSES

hH-bIIEYcsE_1 HI I'M OR BACK IT ON THERE AND WWW DOT AND FIVE A ONE PHOTOGRAPHY DOT COM AND THE TALKING ABOUT SOME PORTRAIT STUDIO LIGHTING TECHNIQUES
hH-bIIEYcsE_2 WE WANT TO DO IMPORTED PHOTOGRAPHY WHEN YOU'RE IN THE STUDIO IS YOU WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE UP A LOT OF LIGHTS REALLY IF YOU WANT TO DO IT RIGHT
hH-bIIEYcsE_3 IT WOULD HAVE A MAIN LIGHT SHOULD JUST TO ONE SIDE OF THE MODEL'S FACE ANYONE EITHER HAVE A SECOND LIGHT OR OF THE WHITE BOUNCE CARD TO BOUNCE THE LIGHT BACK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MODEL'S FACE
hH-bIIEYcsE_4 ANYONE HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A HAIR LIGHT IT WILL BE AIMED AT THE BACK OF THE MODELS HAD TO THEIR HAIR STANDS OUT FROM THE BACKGROUND AND SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THE DEPTH OF THEIR HEAD ACTUALLY
hH-bIIEYcsE_5 AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE ONE OR TWO LIGHTS ON THE BACKGROUND SO THAT THE MODEL STANDS OUT FROM THE BACKGROUND AND IS DEFINED AGAINST THE BACKGROUND IN YOU CAN DO SOMETHING INTERESTING WITHOUT AS WELL YOU CAN PUT A GEL ON THAT'S MAKE IT A DIFFERENT COLOR OR YOU CAN PUT A TEXTURED FABRIC UP ANYTHING THAT CAN BE INTERESTING AND GIVE THE EFFECT THAT YOU WANT TO GET
hH-bIIEYcsE_6 AND THOSE ARE SOME PORTRAIT STUDIO LIGHTING TECHNIQUES
gDJZQybnkmg_1 HI THIS IS BRUCE LESSELS FROM ZOAR OUTDOOR ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE DOT COM TALKING ABOUT LOWING LOW IMPACT CAMPING METHODS
gDJZQybnkmg_2 WHEN YOU'RE CAMPING IN AN AREA GETS USED A LOT YOU ANY TARTAR RISERS RESTRICT OR CAMPING ACTIVITY TO THE AREAS THAT ARE ALREADY ON CAMPED IN THAT ARE EVEN DESIGNATED AS CAMPSITE
gDJZQybnkmg_3 ON THIS CASE YOU HAVE A CAMPSITE IT'S THIS DESIGNATED AS SITE FIVE HAVE HAVE A NICE CLEARLY LAID OUT AREA THAT'S WHAT'S AVAILABLE FOR CAMPING AND UH ONE KEEP IT CAN BE ACTIVITIES THAT WITHIN THIS AREA NOT GO OUTSIDE THEM
gDJZQybnkmg_4 THE IDEA IS TO LIMIT THE IMPACT CERTAIN AREAS AND NOT ALLOW THE IMPACT TO GO TO GET TOO FAR OUT THE ON THOSE AND THEREFORE START TO REALLY RUIN THE AREA AROUND IT
gDJZQybnkmg_5 AGAIN OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO USE THE SIDE OF THE PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE THE ENJOY THE SAME EXPERIENCE YEAR TO ENJOY AND SO IN MORE HEAVILY USED AREAS TRY TO FIND AREAS THAT ARE ALREADY IMPACTED AND THE OTHER ARE USED FOR CAMPING AND TRY TO RECAP IN THOSE AREAS RESPECTFULLY IN AND I USE THEM IN AND I'M IN A GOOD WAY AND HOPEFULLY WHEN YOU COME BACK WE'LL BE AVAILABLE FREIDY'S NEXT ON
gNpN9jn6lAA_1 HI I'M KERRI AT ZEBRA AND BERKLEY AND I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT NOSE PIERCING AND THE HEALING PROCESS
gNpN9jn6lAA_2 WHEN YOU GET YOUR NOSE HEARS INITIALLY THE PENIS PRINTING MINIMAL EIGHT KIND OF ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE POPPING AS A
gNpN9jn6lAA_3 THAT FIRST STAY YOU CAN NOTICE A TOE AND ENDED LEADING AND A LITTLE BIT OF INFLAMMATION
gNpN9jn6lAA_4 THAT'S TO BE EXPECTING
gNpN9jn6lAA_5 AND THEN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS YOU NOSE IS IN A SMALL UP SLIGHTLY ON THE INSIDE NO ONE'S CANNA NOTICE
gNpN9jn6lAA_6 WITH THAT SWELLING GOES DOWN YOUR JEWELRY MINE MOVE AROUND A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE IT'S NOW LOOSER DO TWO MORE SPACE
gNpN9jn6lAA_7 AT THAT POINT YOU'RE PROBABLY IN ONE GO SEE YOUR PIERCER AND HAVE ADJUSTED SO IF IT'S A LOT MORE TIGHTLY
gNpN9jn6lAA_8 IF YOUR JEWELRY MOVES AROUND TOO MUCH FOR THE REST OF THE HEALING PROCESS IT COULD CAUSE IRRITATION IN WOOD RESULT IN AN INFECTION
gNpN9jn6lAA_9 SO IF YOU GO IN AND HAVE AN ADJUST DEAD YOU CAN OF WEIGHT ALL OF THAT
gNpN9jn6lAA_10 FOR THE NEXT FOUR TO SIX WEEKS EVEN ONE AND CONTINUE WITH A REGULAR AFTER CARE PROCESS WHICH CONSISTS OF CLEANING BOTH WITH AN ANTI BACTERIAL SOLUTION
gNpN9jn6lAA_12 AND ALSO SOAKING WITH SALT WATER
gNpN9jn6lAA_13 I CAN NOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT SOAKING WITH SALT WATER IS SHOE THE HEALING PROCESS AND KEEPING YOUR NOSE NICE AND HEALTHY
gNpN9jn6lAA_14 NOSE PIERCINGS HAVE OF VERY HARD TIME HEALING BECAUSE THEY'RE CARTILAGE AND SO IF YOU'RE NOTICING A LITTLE BIT OF REDNESS OR TENDERNESS ARE UNCOMFORTABLENESS IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY NORMAL
gNpN9jn6lAA_15 ALL IN ALL ITS IF THE EASY PROCESSING COMPARED TO OTHER THINGS IN LIFE BUT WITH THE NOSE PIERCING SHOULD EXPECT THAT IT'S NOT IN A LOOK PERFECT UNTIL IT'S DONE HEALING
g4TswJ84cyE_1 I FOLKS IN THIS CLIP WE'LL TALK ABOUT HOW TO WRITE A DOCUMENTARY
g4TswJ84cyE_2 RIDING SCRIPT FOR DOCUMENTARY IS NOT LIKE READING STRIP FOR FUTURE FOAM OBVIOUSLY
g4TswJ84cyE_3 THERE ISN'T AT THE SAME SORT OF NARRATIVE THREAD THE STORY LINE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
g4TswJ84cyE_4 INSTEAD WHICH YOU HAVE IS THE IDEA AND WITH THE ONE PRESENT THE WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU ARE DOCUMENTING EITHER BE AN INDIVIDUAL OR AN EVENT THAT HAPPEN AT ONE POINT WHEN OR ANOTHER OR ISSUE
g4TswJ84cyE_5 SO WHAT ARE GONNA NEED TO DO IS FIRST WILL OUTLINE HOW YOU WANT TO DO THIS SO SIT DOWN IN FRONT OF OF YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN BLANK PAGE AND HAMMER OUT EXACTLY WHERE YOU WANT YOUR PRESENTATION AGO WHEN YOU WANNA COVER HOW YOU WANNA COVER IT AND WHAT ULTIMATELY WHAT MESSAGING RELIEVE WITH THE AUDIENCE TO DO THIS FIRST
g4TswJ84cyE_6 SECOND OF ALL MOST DOCUMENTARIES TODAY HAVE SOME DEGREE OF A VARIATION FOR SOMEONE THAT YOUR BASIC THE GUYS AUDIENCE THROUGH THE PRESENTATION OR HOST MODIFICATION BE SOMEONE EFFECTS ON CAMERA GETTING PEOPLE FOR A LOT TIMES IT'LL BE BOTH
g4TswJ84cyE_7 SO YOU CAN OBVIOUSLY HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT SCRIPTED WORK FOR THIS PERSON SO THE NEXT THAT WOULD THEN BE TO WRITE THIS PORTION OF THE DOCUMENTARY IN YOU WRITE THAT SAME THAT WAY YOU WOULD A SCRIPT
g4TswJ84cyE_8 YOU HAVE I'M BASICALLY YOU WRITE OUT EACH AND EVERY A BIT OF NARRATION AN THAT CHUNK OF THE MOVIE THAT THAT ARE APPLIES TO HUGE DESCRIBED IN DURING THE SEAM WHAT WHAT WOULD BE HAPPIER DURING THAT SHOW WHAT CHUNK OF A MOVIE WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHAT IT IS IT RESENTING WHETHER IT BE IN GRAPHICS ALL OUR OUT FOOTAGE MINIMAL FOODS THAT YOU'VE SHOT YOURSELF
g4TswJ84cyE_9 BASICALLY GET IT ALL WRITTEN DOWN WHEN RIGHT THE NARRATION AS YOU SEE FIT
g4TswJ84cyE_10 A LOT OF TIMES THIS FOOT OUT PART OF THE PRODUCTION LEAD ON AFTER YOU'VE ACTUALLY COLLECTED ALL YOUR FOOTAGE
g4TswJ84cyE_11 MOST THE TIME WHEN YOU'RE USING A DOCUMENTARY YOU ALREADY GOTTEN A BUNCH OF FOOTAGE SHOT SO AS YOU'RE WRITING A NARRATION YOU SORT OF HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF THE STORY THAT HER ULTIMATELY DON'T BE PRESENTED YOUR AUDIENCE

GoZxF1Soz3o_3 THE MUSICIANS THAT WORK HERE ALL PART OF MUSICIANS UNION AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT SCALES OF PAY THAT THE OF MUSICIANS WORK UNDER
GoZxF1Soz3o_4 THERE'S THE DEMO SCALE WHICH IS ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND NINETY DOLLARS PER MUSICIAN FOR THREE HOUR SESSION
GoZxF1Soz3o_5 AND I'M BUT WITH A DEMO SCALE THAT DOESN'T PERMIT YOU TO GO AND SELL YOU FINISH PROJECT
GoZxF1Soz3o_6 SO IF YOU'RE GONNA BE SEWING THIS IN YOUR COMMUNITY VAGUELY CYLINDER FROM STAGE WHEN YOU PLAY PLACES VALUE MIGHT WANNA LOOK IT THE ERA LIMITED PRESSING SCALE WHICH IS JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN DEMO SCALE PER PERSON
GoZxF1Soz3o_7 I'M THE LIMITED PRESSING SCALE ALLOWS YOU TO SELL UP TO TEN THOUSAND COPIES BEFORE WE HAVE TO UPGRADE TO MASTER SCALE
GoZxF1Soz3o_8 TEN THOUSAND QUITE A FEW COPIES TO SELL FROM STAGER OF DRAG YOUR CAR
GoZxF1Soz3o_9 ONE OTHER SKILLET YOU MIGHT CONSIDER IS THE AT A LOW BUDGET SCALE OF WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO SELL YOU KNOW A LIMITED AMOUNT COPIES I'M BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE LOW BUDGET APPROVAL BEFORE YOUR SESSION SO YOU HAVE TO SUBMIT A BUDGET TO THE MUSICIANS UNION A FORTY EIGHT HOURS BEFORE YOUR SCHEDULE SESSION UNORDERED QUALIFY AFTER THIS
GoZxF1Soz3o_10 IT'S NOT MUCH MORE THAN LIMITED PRESSING OR DEMO SCALE BUT THAT WAY YOU CAN GO OUT SO AS MANY CUP IS A LOT OF YOUR PROJECT

gqdh_ETC5uA_5 WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING IS NOT ONLY LEVELING OSLEY HAVE A NICE EVEN FLAT SURFACE ON THE TOP OF THE BASKET BUT ALSO KIND OF PUSH AROUND THE COFFEE IN THE BASKET SO THAT THE COFFEE IS COMPLETELY EVENLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BASKET
gqdh_ETC5uA_6 AND WIPE OUT HERE

hADcB9vMpuQ_4 I LOVE ENJOY IT SOMETHING I JUST DID LAST YEAR
hADcB9vMpuQ_5 IT'S A WE THAT I FOUND OUT BEHIND THEM BEHIND MY HOUSE
hADcB9vMpuQ_6 PUT THE CAMERA ON A TRIPOD AND PHOTOGRAPHS THIS
hADcB9vMpuQ_7 IT'S THE TYPE OF WE'D THAT AS YOU PULL ON IT THE LITTLE SEEDS THAT WILL OFTEN THE DISTANCE
hADcB9vMpuQ_8 BUT WHAT I USE TO GET THE SHOT WAS ON A SET OF CLOSE-UP FILTERS
hADcB9vMpuQ_9 AND NOW CLOSE-UP FILTERS WE'RE ARE A OF FILTERS IS SET THAT YOU SCREW ON THAT AND THE FRONT OF YOUR CAMERA LANDS AND THEY BRING OBJECTS CLOSER
hADcB9vMpuQ_10 MANY TIMES A YEAR LENS DOES CANNOT FOCUS CLOSE ENOUGH WITH AN OLD TO GET A GOOD NATIONAL SHOT
hADcB9vMpuQ_11 AND THIS IS JUST AN EASY WAY TO DO THIS
hADcB9vMpuQ_12 IF YOU'RE A IN THE STUDIO AND DAY YOUR LIGHTING THIS MACRO PHOTOGRAPHY YOU HAVE TO BRING THE LIGHTS IN CLOSER AND ADD MORE LIGHT ON TO GET A GOOD PHOTOGRAPH OF THE OF SMALL OBJECTS

GhfY1UC0ihw_19 THAT'S HOW YOU IF IT THROUGH THE PROCESS
glefpO6HQDg_1 USING SELF MAY BOOKS
glefpO6HQDg_2 YOU CAN START OUT FROM THE BEGINNING AND TEACHING A CHILD THE CORRECT WAY TO HANDLE A BOOK WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT YOUR REAL BOOKS THAT YOU PAY FOR TO LAST MUCH LONGER DOWN THE ROAD
glefpO6HQDg_3 TELL THEM THAT THE SEAM OR THE COVER ALWAYS GOES TO THE LEFT AND YOU CAN TEACH IN THE LEFT AND RIGHT HANDS AT THE SAME TIME THAT SO THAT THEY DON'T TAKE THE BOOK AND START FROM THE BACK WHICH IS VERY NATURAL AND THEY WOULD EVEN PUT IT UPSIDE DOWN IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FACT THAT THE PICTURE WOULD BE UPSIDE DOWN
glefpO6HQDg_4 TO TEACH AND HOW TO HOLD A BOOK TEACH THEM TO ALWAYS READ THE TITLE AND THE AUTHOR AND THE ILLUSTRATOR
glefpO6HQDg_5 SOMETIMES I WILL PUT WRITTEN BY ME OR BY MY NAME AND THEN ILLUSTRATED BY ME AND ILLUSTRATED IS A HARD WORDELL JUST JUST SAY THAT'S ILLUSTRATED TO SAY ILLUSTRATED
glefpO6HQDg_6 SO THE READ THE TITLE THEY RE TO ITS BY THE REED ILLUSTRATOR
glefpO6HQDg_7 THEN THE OPEN THE FIRST PAGE AND YOU CAN T TO ABOUT DEDICATION PAGES IN COPY RINGLETS ON ROW
glefpO6HQDg_8 BUT OUR BOOK START HERE AND THEY START READING
glefpO6HQDg_9 TEACH THEM NEVER TO FOLD OF LOOK BACKWARDS LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT BREAKS THE BINDING
glefpO6HQDg_10 TEACH THEM ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN THINK OF TO TREAT BOOKS CORRECTLY
glefpO6HQDg_11 BOOKS ARE VERY IMPORTANT BOOKS OR TO BE TREASURED TEACH THEM TO LOVE BOOKS FROM THE BEGINNING
glefpO6HQDg_12 AND THEY START READING
glefpO6HQDg_13 TRACKING TEACH THEM TO TAKE THEIR FINGER PUT IT UNDERNEATH EACH WORD AS THE REED IT THAT WILL HELP FOR A LONG TIME
glefpO6HQDg_14 IT'S A KIND OF LIKE TRAINING WHEELS THEY DON'T DO IT FOREVER BUT IT HELPS THE BEGINNING AND
glefpO6HQDg_15 A KICK ACTS SAUCE ACT
glefpO6HQDg_16 AND THEY WOULD SAY ACHE ACT CAT <UNK> AND IF THEY COULDN'T GET IT YOU WOULD HAVE THEM COVER ALL THAT THE FIRST WORD AND YOU TREAT THIS WORD AS INDIVIDUAL TELLING NOT LOOK ANYTHING ELSE UNTIL THE MASTER THAT WORD
glefpO6HQDg_17 AND THEN WHEN YOU GET IT HAVE AND START OVER AND READ FROM BEING A CAT AND MEN'S SAT
glefpO6HQDg_18 ONCE THEY WORK THAT OUT HAVE BEEN READ THE WHOLE THING
glefpO6HQDg_19 A CAT SACK
glefpO6HQDg_20 CUT OUT LOOK OF THE PICTURE
glefpO6HQDg_21 AS I'M MAKING THESE BOOKS I TRY NOT TO MAKE THE PICTURE TO OBVIOUS THAT THEY CAN JUST GUEST BY LOOKING AT THE PICTURES
glefpO6HQDg_22 SOMETIMES A PUT MORE THINGS IN THE PICTURE LIKE ANOTHER DOG OR A RAG OR SOMETHING SO THAT THEY CAN'T AUTOMATICALLY GUESS WHAT IT IS
glefpO6HQDg_23 THE PICTURE IS THE DELIGHT AFTER THEY FINISH READING THE CORRECT SENTENCE TO TELL THEM YES I READ IT CORRECTLY AND LOOK AT THAT COOL LITTLE KAPUT MOM YOUR BAG OR SOMEBODY DROOP
glefpO6HQDg_24 IT LOOKS VERY FUNNY MAYBE I CAN DO BETTER JOB IN A YEAR BUT IN ANY CASE AT HOW IT WORKS AND THERE WE HAVE USING SELF ME BOOKS
glefpO6HQDg_25 AGAIN ONCE AGAIN KEEP THEM ON A SHELF KEEP THEM IN THE SAME PLACE EVERY TIME TEACHER CHILDREN TO TREASURE BOOKS
gnbL9dpsksA_1 HI THIS IS MARY WITH EXPERT VILLAGE DOT COM AND TODAY WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE GERIATRIC TALK FIELDER DOG
gnbL9dpsksA_2 HOLD IS THAT LAST
gnbL9dpsksA_3 WELL FELLOW THAT DEPENDS ON THE BRIE BUT MOSTLY YOU'VE GOT A DOG WHO SEVEN YEARS OF AGE HUMAN TERMS OR OLDER YOU'VE GOT A JIRI AFTER DOCK
gnbL9dpsksA_4 THIS LITTLE ONE RIGHT HERE IS THIRTEEN SO SHE IS DEFINITELY A GERIATRIC DOCK
gnbL9dpsksA_5 ONE OF THE BIG THINGS YOU CAN DO FOR GERIATRIC DOG IS TO WORK THEIR CHEST AREA
gnbL9dpsksA_6 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU DO IS PULLED OR FOUR LEGS APART LIKE THIS AND THAT HELPS TO STIMULATE THE WHOLE LONG AND THE CHEST AREA
gnbL9dpsksA_7 THEN YOU'RE GOING INTO RUBBING MOTIONS
gnbL9dpsksA_8 THE GREEN RAVENOUS CIRCULAR LIGHT GENTLE EASY CLOCK WISE MOTION
gnbL9dpsksA_9 PLEASE MAKE SURE IT'S CLOCKWISE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM WORKS IN AND YOU REALLY DON'T ONE GO AGAINST THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM YOU MIGHT END UP WITH A LOT OF PROBLEMS
gnbL9dpsksA_10 WHEN YOU'RE DONE YOU JUST VERY GENTLY PUT THE FOUR LAID BACK AND HE'LL PROCEED ON TO THE NEXT PART OF YOUR MASSAGE
gMGV-baI3O0_1 RIGHT WRIST <UNK> QUESTIONS ABOUT READING THE RESIN
gMGV-baI3O0_2 YOU DON'T CREATE YOUR OWN VIDEO RESUME YOU CAN AND DO IT NO COST
gMGV-baI3O0_3 IF YOU HAVE A WET CAM CAMCORDER OR DIGITAL CAMERA WITH MOVING MODE YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN VIDEO RESUME
gMGV-baI3O0_4 IF YOU DON'T HAVE HIS EQUIPMENT YOU CAN FIND IT AT YOUR LOCAL BEST FIRE CERTAIN CITY FOR AT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS
gMGV-baI3O0_5 IF YOU <UNK> THAT YOU'RE A SITE AND DOES THAT FEEL MY RESUME DON'T COME INTO A LIST OF LOCAL VIDEO
G_bLKrk709I_1 GO FOR A SMALLER BREED DOG OR I WOULD FILL THE SYRINGE FOR ONE HALF TABLESPOON
G_bLKrk709I_2 YOU OPEN THE DOGS MOUTH THE CHEEK TOWARDS THE OPEN TOWARDS THE CHEEK AND INSERT IT IN AND THEN YOU CAN
G_bLKrk709I_3 PROBABLY TALKED YOUR VETERINARIAN ABOUT HOW FREQUENTLY YOU SHOULD GIVE THE COUGH SYRUP AND WAS THAT MARIAN'S DO RECOMMEND GETTING COUGHS OR FOR SEVERE COUGHING
G_bLKrk709I_4 IF YOUR DOG CAN IS CONTINUING TO COUGH AND THEY'RE GETTING VERY LETHARGIC THEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO PUT THE DOG ON IT BY OUT IT
G_bLKrk709I_5 AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE THAT IS GOING TO DETERMINE WHAT IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO PUT YOUR DOGS AND OF COURSE OF AN OF LAYOUT X TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T BECOME MORE SERIOUS INFECTION
G_bLKrk709I_6 IF YOU FIND THAT YOUR DOG IS VERY LETHARGIC AND BREATHING VERY SHALLOW OLLIE THAN YOU WANT TO BRING THEM TO THE VET NERINE SPECIALIST
G_bLKrk709I_7 IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE LONG NEXT RAISE AND TEST LIGHT OXYGEN LEVELS
G_bLKrk709I_8 IF THE DOG IS OF TRYING TO OF WEIGHT COUGHING WHEN COUGHING BECOMES VERY UNCOMFORTABLE THE DOG CAN START OF WEIGHT COUGHING BY TAKING SHALLOW BRASS THE MORE SHALLOW BREATHS THEY TAKE THE LESS OXYGEN IS COMING IN AND IT WILL ACTUALLY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF BLOOD OXYGEN IN THE BODY
G_bLKrk709I_9 SO IN THE CASE BECOMES VERY EXTREME THE DOCK THE DOG MIGHT NEED SOME MEDICAL ATTENTION
G_bLKrk709I_10 THEY MIGHT NEED TO HAVE A HOME OXYGEN PLACED INTO NASALLY
G_bLKrk709I_11 THEY MIGHT NEED TO BE AN IV FLUIDS
G_bLKrk709I_12 SO KENNEL COUGH CAN BE SOMETHING THAT'S FAIRLY MILD IN DOGS GET OVER THE DAY OR TWO AND IT CAN BE SOMETHING THAT CAN WILL CAUSE YOU DON'T TO WIND UP IN A HOSPITAL FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND WE JUST TALKED ABOUT A COUPLE OF THINGS YOU CAN DO TO TRY TO HELP CARE FOR THEM
h4eS2jw8DA8_1 MY NAME IS KATE JAMES I'M A COMPOUNDING PHARMACIST IN EUGENE OREGON AT BROADWAY APOTHECARY
h4eS2jw8DA8_2 AND NOW I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS IN SOME OF THE KNOTS A WONDERFUL THINGS AS FAR AS IN A PHARMACIST ARROWS
h4eS2jw8DA8_3 GREAT THINGS ARE YOU GET TO WORK WITH PEOPLE
h4eS2jw8DA8_4 ONE OF THE BAT THINGS IS YOU GET TO WORK WITH PEOPLE
h4eS2jw8DA8_5 I LOVE AND AT THAT CAN BE A PLUS AN A MINUS
h4eS2jw8DA8_6 SOME A LOT OF PEOPLE WE DEAL WITH THEIR SEC THEY DON'T FEEL WELL THEY'RE NOT VERY HAPPY ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE TO PAY HURT PRESCRIPTIONS AS FAR AS INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENT RATE CLOTHES
h4eS2jw8DA8_7 SO THAT CAN BE DIFFICULT THING BUT IT'S ALSO WONDERFUL THING BECAUSE YOU GET TO BUILD A RELATIONSHIP WITH PEOPLE
h4eS2jw8DA8_8 ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITY PHARMACY WHETHER YOU'RE IN A CHAIN OR AN INDEPENDENT OR THAT TYPE OF SETTING
h4eS2jw8DA8_9 YOU REALLY GET TO KNOW PEOPLE AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THE MEDICINE OVER TIME
h4eS2jw8DA8_10 AND THAT'S A REALLY NEAT FEELING
h4eS2jw8DA8_11 YOU REALLY BECOME A PART OF THE COMMUNITY AS THEY'RE PHARMACISTS
h4eS2jw8DA8_12 ANOTHER GREAT THING ABOUT BEING A PHARMACIST IS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO SIT THERE SCHEDULES FAIRLY NICELY
h4eS2jw8DA8_13 THERE'S A LOT OF PART TIME WORK AVAILABLE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE APPRECIATE THAT
h4eS2jw8DA8_14 THEY ARE ABLE TO REALLY PURSUE THERE IF A INTERESTS AND ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE OF WORK AND THE PHARMACY CAREER ALLOWS FOR THAT QUITE NICELY
h4eS2jw8DA8_15 ON THE OTHER KONG'S I WOULD SAY INSURANCE PHYSICAL ON
h4eS2jw8DA8_16 THAT'S NOT A WONDERFUL THING TO DEAL WITH
h4eS2jw8DA8_17 IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE ALWAYS STRUGGLING IT'S AN UPHILL BATTLE TO TRAIN GET PEOPLE WITH THEY NEED AND THE THAT CAN KINDA DRAG AGAIN SOME DAYS
h4eS2jw8DA8_18 HANDS WHEN THE OTHER THING IS WORK LOAD
h4eS2jw8DA8_19 THAT WOULD BE A CLIMB ON IT
h4eS2jw8DA8_20 IT TURNS OUT THAT MORE MORE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THE BABY BOOMERS COMING ON OUR KNEADING MEDICATIONS
h4eS2jw8DA8_21 AND SEE CAN HAVE A VERY BUSY VERY JAM PACK TODAY
h4eS2jw8DA8_22 SOMETIMES BREAKS IN LUNGES JUST DON'T HAPPEN AND LEARN TO DEAL WITH THAT
h4eS2jw8DA8_23 BUT OVERALL IT'S VERY REWARDING AND BECAUSE YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT YOU'RE HELPING SOMEBODY OR EDUCATING SOMEBODY HANDS YOUR ENABLING SOMEBODY TO HAVE A NICE HEALTHY LIFE

gZQQqykotQE_7 ONE WAY IS IF YOU GOT A QUARTERBACK LIKE THIS ONE THAT'S BIG IN STRONG AND CAN KEEP THIS GUY FROM GET IN THE PLAY THEM AGAIN PLAY BUMP AND RUN COVERAGE
gZQQqykotQE_8 IF YOU GOTTA UNDERSIZED QUARTERBACK THAN YOU CAN'T USE BUMP AND RUN COVERAGE BECAUSE YOU GET A GOOD ABUSE
gZQQqykotQE_9 SO THIS GUY'S GOT IT WOULD COME UP A LOT OF A LIMITED GOING CHECK AT THE INITIAL LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND WHAT EACH RUN A NEWS TO PREVENT THIS GUY FROM GETTING INTO ANY KIND OF PATTER
gZQQqykotQE_10 ALSO ONE THING THAT THIS WORKS GREAT WITH IS IN SHORT YARDAGE SITUATIONS
gZQQqykotQE_11 IT ALSO WORKS GOOD IF WE GOT A LINEBACKER ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT IS BLITZING AND WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE GETTING BE GETTING TO THE QUARTERBACK QUICK
gZQQqykotQE_12 ALL WE WANT TO DO IS HOLD THIS GUY UP SO THE QUARTERBACK CAN'T MAKE A PASS
gZQQqykotQE_13 SO TO LOOK A LITTLE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
gZQQqykotQE_15 IS GONNA CHECK IN AS GOOD AS THEY WITH HIM
gZQQqykotQE_16 AND REMEMBER ONCE YOU GET PAST FIVE YARDS YOU CAN NO LONGER MAKE CONTACT WITH THAT GUY YOU JUST GET A WRONG WITH IT

GoH5ZPL4-0s_3 IT'S SIMILAR TO SEVEN STUDIES HAVE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CARD SHOWING
GoH5ZPL4-0s_4 ALL CARDS ARE FACE DOWN
GoH5ZPL4-0s_5 ANACONDA IS ALSO A SPLIT POT GAME WHERE THE HIGH HAND ARE BEST FIVE CARD HAND ONE HALF THE POT AND THE BEST LOW HAND WILL WIN HALF ON AS WELL
GoH5ZPL4-0s_6 LET'S SEE HOW ANACONDA IS DEALT OUT
GoH5ZPL4-0s_7 FIRST THE DEALER WILL DULL SEVEN CARDS FACE DOWN TO EACH PLAYER
GoH5ZPL4-0s_8 ONCE THE SEVEN CARDS ARE DEALT OUT A BETTING ROUND WILL FOLLOW
GoH5ZPL4-0s_9 AFTER THE BETTING ROUND THE FOOT IS A LOOK AT THEIR HANDS AND DECIDE WHICH THREE CARDS OF ACTUALLY WANT TO GET RID OF
GoH5ZPL4-0s_10 AND THIS IS BASED ON WHETHER OR NOT THEIR HAND IS GONNA GO FOR A LOW HAND OR HIGH HAND
GoH5ZPL4-0s_11 NOW IN THIS CASE THIS PERSON WOULD HAVE TO GIVE A THREE CARDS AND ACTUALLY BREAK UP A FLUSH THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE
GoH5ZPL4-0s_12 IT'S PLAY WITH THE THREE CARDS
GoH5ZPL4-0s_13 ASK THEM TO THE LEFT
GoH5ZPL4-0s_14 THERE'S THREE QUARTER PICKED UP BY EACH PLAYER AND ANOTHER BETTING ROUND WILL START
GoH5ZPL4-0s_15 ONCE THAT BETTING ROUND IS OVER ANY PLAYER WILL LOOK AT THEIR HAND AND SEE WHICH TWO CHORDS THEY WANT TO PASS
GoH5ZPL4-0s_16 IT WOULD THEN PAST TWO CARDS
GoH5ZPL4-0s_17 THIS PERSON GET LUCKY IN MADE THE FLUSH AGAIN
GoH5ZPL4-0s_18 <UNK> GET RID OF THESE TWO
GoH5ZPL4-0s_19 AND JUST FOR STRUCTURAL PURPOSES IT WAS CAN OF HALF OF CARDS AROUND THE TWO
GoH5ZPL4-0s_20 ONCE THE TWO CARDS HAVE BEEN PASS AND ON THE FLAVOR OF NOW HAVE SEVEN CARDS AGAIN THE BETTING ROUND WILL FOLLOW
GoH5ZPL4-0s_21 AFTER THAT BETTING ROUND IS PERSON WILL PASS ONE COLOR TO THE PLAYER TO THE <UNK>
GoH5ZPL4-0s_22 NOW EACH PLAYER HAS SEVEN CARDS IN THEIR HAND AND WE'LL BE DOING SPLIT POT WHERE THE PLAY WITH THE BEST FIVE CARD HAND IN THE PLAY WITH THE WORST THING IN THE LOW HAND WILL WIN HALF THE POT AND THAT'S HOW ANACONDA IS PLAYED

GSTw7LOhuhI_2 NOW GIVEN THAT THE COWSER WILL BE CLOSE TO THE HAUL THEY GIVE YOU PERMISSION ON IT TAKE THIS TIME TO DO WE CALL KIND OF PUSH AND BACK
GSTw7LOhuhI_3 BECAUSE IF WE START OUT WITH THE COWS ALREADY THING AGAIN ABOUT CUTTING ACROSS WOULDN'T BE AT A GREAT DISADVANTAGED AS THEY WILL THINK AND THEN THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE
GSTw7LOhuhI_4 SO WE'LL START OVER NOW AND WE'RE IN A TRY TO PUT TOGETHER THE CANTIN WORK THAT WOULD BRING US TO A VERY QUICK FINISH AND THE WITH ENOUGH IF EFFECTIVE

GUE6zOwZogY_2 ROLL ON MOST OF THEM ARE EQUIPPED WITH LIKE A BALL BEARING TIGHT SWIVEL AT THE VERY END ON SO THAT MAY SYMBOL BUT FASTER ON AND THE JUMP ROPE IS OUT OF THE BALL THAT INSIDE THE HANDLE
GUE6zOwZogY_3 THESE ARE ALSO ADJUSTABLE IF YOU DECIDE THAT EIGHTH NINTH THAT ONE IS TOO LONG FERVOR OF YOUR AVERAGE BOXER MOST OR BOXERS
GUE6zOwZogY_4 YOU CAN NON ACTUALLY SHORT A BIKE PASSING THE THE I'LL JUST GO BACK TO ITS THROUGH THE HANDLE ITSELF THERE'S USUALLY A NET OR A A WIRE OF COUPLING ON THERE THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY OF CUT AND THEN REATTACH SO YOU GET A LITTLE BIT ON SHORTER JUMP ROPE

G5I3Jru9zAw_1 HI I'M HOLLY HEIDEMANN AND TODAY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT EQUIPMENT INVOLVED WITH BARREL RACING
G5I3Jru9zAw_2 ANOTHER ONE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT'S AT I HAVE ALL THE CHILDREN AND YOUNG RIDERS PUT ON IS A HELMET
G5I3Jru9zAw_3 MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT HELMETS ABOUT BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE <UNK> INCH NAMES BUT THEY'RE SOME PEOPLE THAT HAVE SUFFERED FALZON HAD SOME REALLY SERIES INJURIES BECAUSE OF FALLING FROM A HORSE
G5I3Jru9zAw_4 A BEGINNER RIDER OR RIGHT IT'S INEXPERIENCED WERE YOUNG RIDER TO DEFTLY WEAR A HELMET
G5I3Jru9zAw_5 AS YOU ADVANCE OR SOME PEOPLE CHOOSE NOT TO WEAR THEM AS CHOICES THAT TO YOU BUT I LIKE ALL YOUNG RIDERS NOLEN EXPERIENCE RIDERS TO MAKE SURE THEY WEAR A HELMET
G5I3Jru9zAw_6 HOW DOES NOT PROTECTED FROM EVERYTHING IS TO HAVE TO USE REALLY GOOD COMMON SENSE
G5I3Jru9zAw_7 ON THE ONE THING THAT YOU WANT TO WATCH AS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU FOOTING IN THE ARENA IS VERY GOOD AT THE SAFETY FEATURE
G5I3Jru9zAw_8 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE IN TAKING CARE OF THE GROUND
G5I3Jru9zAw_9 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE YOU KNOW WHERE THE GATE IS IF YOUR HORSE IS A FREE RUNNER THAT YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO STOP WHEN TO GET OUT THE GATE
G5I3Jru9zAw_10 IN MANY SAFETY FEATURES INVOLVED IT ALL STARTS WITH HELMETS
G5I3Jru9zAw_11 I WRITE THIS FIRST
G5I3Jru9zAw_12 THIS IS A PRETTY HEAVY FETA SPURS
G5I3Jru9zAw_13 YOU CAN HAVE ALL DIFFERENT KINDS BURRS
G5I3Jru9zAw_14 SPURS A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE BAR A I'M TOO AGGRESSIVE AND EVEN ABUSIVE TOE HORSE
G5I3Jru9zAw_15 SPURS ARE ONLY ABUSIVE IF THE RIDER USES THEM THAT WAY
G5I3Jru9zAw_16 I LIKE THESE BIRDS IS AN EXTENSION OF MY LADY
G5I3Jru9zAw_17 I'M VERY CAREFUL NOT TO GOUGE A HORSE
G5I3Jru9zAw_18 IT'S A TOUCH AND KNOWLEDGE IS IS TO MAKE THINGS VERY LIGHT FOR YOUR HORSE
G5I3Jru9zAw_19 NOT KICKING THE AIR AVENUE JUST USING THE AS EXTENSIONS THEY CAN FEEL ALL OF YOUR KEYS
G5I3Jru9zAw_20 THIS IS THE CALF
G5I3Jru9zAw_21 THIS ON THIS IS BECOME ONE MY MOST FAVORITE PIECES OF EQUIPMENT
G5I3Jru9zAw_22 THE REASON WHY IS IT HOLD THEM HORSE'S MOUTH CLOSED
G5I3Jru9zAw_23 IF YOU'VE EVER NOTICE WHEN YOU PULL ON YOUR HORSE MAY GOOD OPEN THEIR MOUTH YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY KIND OF CONTROL OUT OF THAT
G5I3Jru9zAw_24 THIS CREATES THEM NOT BEING ABLE TO DO THAT
G5I3Jru9zAw_25 SO I MUST MY HORSES WHEN I'M DOING MY HORSEMANSHIP WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT A MOMENT I LIKE TO USE SOME KIND OF A GREEN SNAPPLE OR A D RING SNAPPLE MEANING THAT IT'S VERY CLOSE TO THE HORSE THE SIDES OF THE MOUTH WHERE THE CONTACT COMES OF THE REINS
G5I3Jru9zAw_26 AND THEN THE MOUTH PIECE IS EITHER A TWO OR SOMETIMES A THREE PIECE MOUTHPIECE
G5I3Jru9zAw_27 THE OTHER THING I TALKED ABOUT WITH BAILING THIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS COMBINATION TOUGH IS THAT HE IS A VERY SHORT NECK
G5I3Jru9zAw_28 KICK TO CUT THE OF THE SHORT THAT HE HAS A TENDENCY TO ELEVATE HIS HEAD IN HIS TURNS
G5I3Jru9zAw_29 IF NOT TO THE POINT WHERE HE WOULD BE AROUND AWAY OUR PRIMARY THING LIKE THAT BUT IT JUST DOESN'T GET IN QUITE A SNAP IT TURN AND I WOULD LIKE AND SO THIS IS A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT CALLED OVER THE POLE TIED ON
G5I3Jru9zAw_30 AGAIN I'M A BIG FAN FOR HORSES THAT HAVE SHORT NEXT IS REALLY HELPS THEM
G5I3Jru9zAw_31 I DON'T RIGHT I'M IN THIS ALL THE TIME I ONLY RUN THAN THAT
G5I3Jru9zAw_32 THE REASON WHY IS IT GOES OVER THEIR HEAD BEHIND THEIR EARS IN OVER THEIR EYES
G5I3Jru9zAw_33 AND WHAT THAT DOES IS WHEN THE ELEVATE THEIR HEAD IT PUTS PRESSURE ON IT AND BRING THAT BACK DOWN
G5I3Jru9zAw_34 A HORSE THAT GETS US TO THIS NOW THAT SNARE AND BAILEY WILL DISCOVER RUN KEEP HIS HEAD A LITTLE LOWER IT
G5I3Jru9zAw_35 HE RUNS MATURE CONTRA GLUE THAT WAY
G5I3Jru9zAw_36 IF YOU WERE TO WORK OF WORSE THAN THAT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT ALL THE TIME IT CAN MAKE THEM SO OVER TIME YOU DON'T WANT THAT
G5I3Jru9zAw_37 SO I WAS SINCE THEY KNOW IT'S THERE GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT OFF WHEN I'M WORKING ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THEN JUST GO BACK TO USING IT WHEN I RUNS
G5I3Jru9zAw_38 AS FAR AS LANES DELFT FLIGHT LEATHER REINS
G5I3Jru9zAw_39 ONE REASON THAT THEY'RE NICE IS THAT THEY FEEL REALLY GOOD IF AN IN YOUR HANDS
G5I3Jru9zAw_40 THE OTHER THING I LIKE ABOUT A MIKE THESE BRAIDED ONES BECAUSE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF FRICTION THEY'RE LIKE WE'VE HOLD ARRANGE YOUR HAND IT DOESN'T PULL THROUGH
G5I3Jru9zAw_41 THE NICE NICE SET OF RANGE
G5I3Jru9zAw_42 I LIKE MY LEANS FAIRLY SHORT
G5I3Jru9zAw_43 I WHEN YOU RUN AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT WHEN I GO TO WORK MY HORSE IN A FEW MINUTES
G5I3Jru9zAw_44 IF YOU ARRANGE OR NOT SHORT WHEN YOU GO TO TAKE THAT TURN AROUND THE BARREL WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE TOO MUCH FLAP AND ON THE OUTSIDE AND THEY CAN DISCUSS FADE AWAY FROM IT
G5I3Jru9zAw_45 SO IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM THAT SHORT OF DRAINS
G5I3Jru9zAw_46 THIS IS THE OTHER PIECE OF EQUIPMENT EASILY CLOSE
G5I3Jru9zAw_47 THESE ARE CALLED OVERREACH THIS
G5I3Jru9zAw_48 THEIR LIVES THIRTY TO TIE THIS RAM'S WITH ENOUGH AND PUT YOUR LETTUCE THESE HAVE A LITTLE BOLD IN THE BACK THAT JUST KEEPS THOSE FROM TURNING AROUND
G5I3Jru9zAw_49 IT'S VERY ENCOUNTER BOLTS THE HORSES LEG WILL BE LIKE THIS SAY THIS WHERE THE TURN AROUND AND THEY BE TURNED RUN WITH THAT AGAINST IT
G5I3Jru9zAw_50 IT'S REALLY INCOME <UNK>
G5I3Jru9zAw_51 SO MAKE SURE YOU GET A KIND OF HAVE A BOWL THAT LIKE THIS TO TRY AND KEEP THEM FROM TURNING IT
G5I3Jru9zAw_52 IT WON'T WORK A HUNDRED PERCENT THAT WILL HELP
gxPOvjOIsUM_1 I'M KELLY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME TIPS AND TECHNIQUES THAT I USE LAND CONCEALING DARK CIRCLES UNDER THE EYES
gxPOvjOIsUM_2 SOME PEOPLE WILL USE A COUPLE DIFFERENT KINDS OF COLOR CORRECTIVE CONCEALERS WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO COVER MORE SERIOUS DISCOLORATIONS AROUND THE EYE AREA
gxPOvjOIsUM_3 SEE YOU CAN USE AN WAS A TINY LITTLE AT A SHADOW RATE HERE ON THE INNER PART OF THE EYE WHICH WILL USUALLY BE MORE OF A PURPLISH COLOR SO YOU WOULD WANT TO USE A YELLOW CONCEALER THERE TO HELP NEUTRALIZES THAT
gxPOvjOIsUM_4 YOU ALSO MAY ON HAVE A PERSON WHO'S A LITTLE MORE RED OR LAMAR SWELLING UNDER THE EYES THAT USUALLY WILL BE RIGHT UNDER THE LASH LINE THE LOWER LASH LINE SO YOU'D WHEN YOU THE GREEN BASE THERE
gxPOvjOIsUM_5 ON SOMETIMES WILL SEE PEOPLE WITH VEINS OR A BLOOD VESSELS THAT ARE REALLY CLOSE THE SERVICE MORE OF A BLUISH TENSIONER WILL USUALLY BE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN IN THE EYE FAKIE IS THE MAIN WHEN EASE OF PINK CONCEALER THERE TO HELP COVER THAT UP A LITTLE BIT
gxPOvjOIsUM_6 WE'RE IF YOU'RE HAVE A LOT OF BLUE IN THE CORNER OF THE EYE ME ONE IS A THINK THERE THAT WILL REALLY HELP TO BRIGHTEN UP THE EYE AS WELL
gxPOvjOIsUM_7 SO YOU CAN DEADLY INCORPORATE DIFFERENT OTHER COLORS OF COLOR CRACKING CONCEALER IN TO YOUR UNDER EYE AREA AND TEAR COVERING ON REGIMEN TO GIVE YOU BETTER COVERAGE AND IS DETERMINE WHAT KIND OF DISCOLORATION YOU HAVEN'T WHICH AREA AND PUT THAT ON CAN PROPER CONCEALER THERE BEFORE YOU PUT A CONCEALER THAT MATCHES YOUR SKIN TONE ALL OVER THE ENTIRE EYE
gxPOvjOIsUM_8 SO THAT'S WHERE YOU WANT TO APPLY COLOR CORRECTIVE CONCEALER

HbAyUeyxH7A_3 SO YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST A QUESTION TASTE
HbAyUeyxH7A_4 BUT ON IT'S REALLY EASY IN YOU DON'T EVEN A LOT OF ELECTRONICS ANY EXCEPT FOR JUST LEAVE IT VERY BASICS OF YOU KNOW CONDUCTING ELECTRICITY BETWEEN TWO PARTS ARE MADE OUT OF METAL <UNK>

G7CROWWKnsc_1 ONE A TUCK TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THINGS THAT ON GOING IN WEISZ ADVISE YOU NOT TO DO OKAY
G7CROWWKnsc_2 IF YOU GO TO STUDY CALLIGRAPHY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD NOT DO IS COMPETE WITH TIGHT
G7CROWWKnsc_3 IN OTHER WORDS YOU DON'T END UP WITH LETTERS THAT LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE TIGHT THAT YOU MIGHT AS WELL AND JUST USE A TIGHT
G7CROWWKnsc_4 WHY YOU LETTERS LOOK LIKE THEY'RE ALIVE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT TIGHT JUST CAN'T DO
G7CROWWKnsc_5 IT'S GOT CANNOT OF YOUR HAND SO IT'S GOING TO BE POSSIBLY SLIGHTLY IN PERFECT

G7CROWWKnsc_8 THERE'S ANOTHER KIND OF STUFF AND I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT WHICH I THINK IS LIKE SERIOUSLY IN FOURTH HANG
G7CROWWKnsc_9 I KNOW THERE ARE CYBERTRENDS OUT THERE FOR WHO HAVE IS TENDENCY TO THINK IN TERMS OF OH THAT'S INTERESTING HOW CAN I DO THAT ON THE COMPUTER
G7CROWWKnsc_10 THIS IS NOT ABOUT HOW YOU CAN DO THIS ON THE COMPUTER
G7CROWWKnsc_11 THIS IS GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
G7CROWWKnsc_12 IF YOU START IF YOU START THINKING THAT WAY THAT PICK UP THE PAN AND DO IT OKAY
G7CROWWKnsc_13 IF YOU KEEP THINKING IN TERMS OF HOW CAN I DO THIS ON THE COMPUTER
G7CROWWKnsc_14 TO MY MIND IT'S A LOT LIKE YOU PUT A DVD IN THAT YOU WANT A WATCH AND THEN YOU FAST BOARD TO THE END OKAY
G7CROWWKnsc_15 YOU JUST LAST EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN THAT GIVES IT VALUE AND GIVES IT MEANING

GRo-h1ydCo4_1 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE DOT COM MY NAME IS STAN AND I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT COMMUNITY THEATER AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT YOUR PROPS AND COSTUMES AND HOW TO STORE THEM ON AND YOU MAKE UP AS WELL
GRo-h1ydCo4_2 ON IT THE BIG PROBLEM OF CROPS MAKEUP AND COSTUMES IS KEEPING HIM ORGANIZED KEEPING IN INVENTORY OF THE MEN STORING
GRo-h1ydCo4_3 ESPECIALLY THE COSTUMES I'M PROPS GET TO BE QUITE A STORAGE PROBABLY
GRo-h1ydCo4_4 ONE THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TRY TO BORROW THINGS THAT YOU CAN RETURN OR BY CHEAP THINGS FROM THRIFT SHOPS AND THEN WE DON'T IN FRONT OF THE THRIFT SHOPS SO THAT YOU DON'T BUILD UP A HUGE INVENTORY OF THINGS
GRo-h1ydCo4_5 EVERY PLAY HAS SOME COSTUMES UNDER AND PROPS THAT ARE PRETTY STANDARD BUT THEY'RE ALSO SOME UNIQUE THING THAT YOU PROBABLY WON'T NEED AGAIN FOR YEARS
GRo-h1ydCo4_6 WHY TAKE UP SPACE TRYING TO STORE THEM ON
GRo-h1ydCo4_7 IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY IN CHARGE OF EACH OF THOSE FUNCTIONS THEY CAN BE IN CHARGE OF KEEPING THESE THINGS ORGANIZED INVENTORY AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
GRo-h1ydCo4_8 SOMETIMES YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF GOING ON BUYING A PROP AND FINDING ALREADY HAD IT IN STORAGE BUT NOBODY REALIZE THAT WAS THERE
GRo-h1ydCo4_9 ON SOAP HAVING A LIST OF THOSE ARE HAVING A COMPUTER DATABASE IS REALLY A HANDY THING IF YOU CAN GET ORGANIZED ENOUGH TO DO THAT
GRo-h1ydCo4_10 WE FIND THESE SAUT PLASTIC YOUR CABINETS TO BE VERY HANDY FOR STORING THING
GRo-h1ydCo4_11 PARTICULARLY MAKEUP AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT REALLY SHOULDN'T BE LEFT OUT WORKING IT DUSTY IN THAT SORT OF THING ON SO
GRo-h1ydCo4_12 THESE ORGANIZING THING THAT YOU CAN GET THE OF AT ANY OF DISCOUNT STORE ARE VERY HANDY WAYS OF STORING THINGS
GRo-h1ydCo4_13 COSTUMES TYPICALLY WE HAVE HANGING UP FINE RACKS AND THE COVER THE PLASTIC HEAT THE DUST OFF OF THEM UP WE DON'T STAR MANY COSTUMES HERE
GRo-h1ydCo4_14 WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO A VERDE VALLEY THEATER WAS WORK OUT OF OF COOPERATIVE ARRANGING FORM LOCAL SCHOOLS OF HAS A DRAMA DEPARTMENT
GRo-h1ydCo4_15 THEY STORE OR COSTUMES AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE DUST WHENEVER WE NEED THEM OR WHAT I USE THEM AND THE SCHOOL ALSO HAS THE USE
GRo-h1ydCo4_16 THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE THE MORE USE THAT WAY
GRo-h1ydCo4_17 ON AND WE DON'T HAVE TO STORE THEM ON AND THAT'S A BIG BENEFIT DOES
GRo-h1ydCo4_18 LIKE MOST THE EARS WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF STORAGE SPACE
GRo-h1ydCo4_19 EVEN WITH THE NEW THEATER BUILDING THAT'S BEING DONATED DOES A WE STILL WANT HAVEN'T OF STORAGE SPACE TO KEEP A LARGE INVENTORY COSTUMES
GRo-h1ydCo4_20 SO IF YOU CAN WORK OUT A COOPERATE WITH ANOTHER ORGANIZATION HENNA STORAGE SPACE THAT'S A REAL BENEFIT
Gmr0ojPiEXo_1 I ADDED AND THE ORGAN AND TALK ABOUT THE MACHINE AND EVERYTHING YOU NEED OF FOR THE MACHINE TO BE READY TO PRINTS LESSON
Gmr0ojPiEXo_2 AND I'M WITH THE FIRST THINGS IS LOW TURN MACHINE ON ON IT AND LET IT WARM UP AND THAT AND GET OUT TO THE ENGINE OPERATING GINGER
Gmr0ojPiEXo_3 ON ONE OF THE NEXT THINGS IS REALLY IMPORTANT A EASY STEP TO MESS IS FILLING OUT THE WATER TANK WHICH IT ON THIS MACHINE IS UNDER THIS UNDER THIS PLAYER IT HERE IN THE BACK OF THE MACHINE
Gmr0ojPiEXo_4 ON A LOT MACHINES THAT DON'T HAVE AN AUTOMATIC SHOT OFF WHERE IT JUMPS OFF IF THE WATER TANK IS ANTI IF IT DOESN'T HAVE IT THAT FUSION WHICH IS AN DOES THEN THEY CAN MESS OF THESE MASSAGING WHOLE LIFE YOU KIND OF AN COFFEE AND THAT IS INTO
Gmr0ojPiEXo_5 E ON YOU HAVE YOUR ESPRESSO MACHINE ALL WARMED UP
Gmr0ojPiEXo_6 YOU CAN MAKE SURE EVERYTHING SLOW AND RIGHT OUT OF THE LAST STEAM WAND BINDERS CANNA PERSIAN AND INTO A TOWEL
Gmr0ojPiEXo_7 YOU DON'T WANT TO BE CAREFUL AND WRAP THE TOWEL AROUND IT LIKE EDGES DENSITY DON'T BURN YOURSELF ON MAYBE FLOW WATER THROUGH THE GROUP AND THROUGH THE PORTA FILTER AND WHO HALF
Gmr0ojPiEXo_8 IT'S ALSO THEM WARM UP VIA PORTA FILTER
Gmr0ojPiEXo_9 END HALF MOON HIM
GddcwkKELd4_1 I'VE THIS IS JOHN MICHAELS WITH EXPERT VILLAGE
GddcwkKELd4_2 IT WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT BUYING A NEW CAR
GddcwkKELd4_3 IN THIS SEGMENT WHEN IT'S OUT ABOUT CREDITWORTHINESS
GddcwkKELd4_4 LISTEN IF YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE BEST CREDIT IN THE WORLD IT'S OKAY DON'T BE AFRAID THINKING THAT YOU CAN BUY A NEW CAR
GddcwkKELd4_5 THERE ARE MANY MANY CAR MANUFACTURERS OUT THERE THAT ARE A LOT MORE LENIENT THAN YOU MIGHT THINK
GddcwkKELd4_6 FOR EXAMPLE FOR MOTOR CREDIT IS ONE OF THE MOST LENIENT FINANCING COMPANIES AVAILABLE TODAY
GddcwkKELd4_7 SO EVEN IF YOU HAVE A LOW CREDIT SCORE THEY CAN STILL FINANCIAL AND NEW CAR
GddcwkKELd4_8 SOMETIMES EASIER THAN OTHER MANUFACTURERS
GddcwkKELd4_9 TO DO DO YOUR HOMEWORK WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCING AND WHEN IT COMES TO LEE SEEING IT WHEN IT COMES TO JUST THE OVERALL CREDITWORTHINESS OF WHAT YOU THINK YOU CAN BUY THAT YOU MAY BE DRIVING IN A CAR AS OPPOSED TO NOT RUNNING IN THE CAR IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE RIGHT PRODUCT LINE
GddcwkKELd4_10 SO REMEMBER SOME PRODUCT LINES WILL ALLOW YOU TO FINANCE A CAR AND ACTUALLY ACHIEVE ALONE FOR YOU AND OTHERS
GddcwkKELd4_11 JUST GO OUT AND FIND THE ONE THAT THAT SUTURE CREDIT KNEES AND COMPATIBILITY

gbYt1ZlN5Xw_11 THERE WE GO
H6WIfzbz2SU_1 IN THIS SERIES I'LL BE DISCUSSING THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARDS IN MAGIC THE GATHERING
H6WIfzbz2SU_2 CARDS ALL FALL UNDER TO CATEGORIES LAND FOR SPELLS
H6WIfzbz2SU_3 ANYTHING THAT'S NOT A LAND IS AT SOME POINT A SPELL EVEN IF IT BECOMES SOMETHING ELSE AFTER
H6WIfzbz2SU_4 THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARDS ARE LAND CREATURE ARTIFACT ENCHANTMENT SORCERY INSTANT TRIBAL AND PLANES WALKER
H6WIfzbz2SU_5 CARDS CAN ALSO HAVE SOME TYPES AND SUPER TIGHTS
H6WIfzbz2SU_6 SOME TYPES COME AFTER THE TYPE SUPERTYPE SCUM BEFORE THE TIE
H6WIfzbz2SU_7 EVERY CARD HAS AT LEAST ONE TIGHT AND MANY CARDS HAVE MORE THAN ONE SUCH AS ARTIFACT CREATURES AND TRY POCKETS
H6WIfzbz2SU_8 THE WAY THAT IT'S ORGANIZED IS THAT'S HALFWAY BETWEEN THE PICTURE AND THE TEXT BOX IS WHAT'S CALLED THE TIGHT LINE
H6WIfzbz2SU_9 THIS SAYS BASIC LAND FOREST AND IS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST CARDS IN TERMS OF TIGHT
H6WIfzbz2SU_10 ALSO ON THE TYPE LINE IS THE EXPANSION SET THAT INDICATES WHERE IT
gGGPUNrOZsk_1 HERE WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE TWO EXAMPLES OF TWO DIFFERENT TYPES THAT AND ARE SET
gGGPUNrOZsk_2 THERE ARE MANY CREATURES IN THE GAME WHICH ARE BOTH ARTIFACTS AND CREATURES
gGGPUNrOZsk_3 THIS REPRESENTS THE IDEA OF ROBOTS ANOTHER ONE MACHINES THAT SIEGE ENGINES
gGGPUNrOZsk_4 THIS IS THE EXTRUDER AND THIS IS A GOBLIN WON'T WAGON
gGGPUNrOZsk_5 IT WILL SAY ARTIFACT CREATURE AND ARE TIGHT AND THEY BOTH HAVE UP POWER AND TOUGHNESS IN THE LOWER RIGHT HAND CORNER
gGGPUNrOZsk_6 THAT MEANS THAT THESE CARDS CAN BE AFFECTED EITHER BY THINGS THAT EFFECT IN SHOULD UP ARTIFACTS DESTROY TARGET ARTIFACT OR ENCHANTMENT SUCH AS DISENCHANT
gGGPUNrOZsk_7 OR SOMETHING THAT SAYS TARGET CREATURE GETS MINUS THREE MINUS THREE UNTIL END OF TURN
gGGPUNrOZsk_8 EITHER A CURSE LIKE WE'RE DISENCHANT CAN KILL EITHER OF THESE CARDS BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH ARTIFACTS DISENCHANT AND THEY BOTH HAVE THREE TOUGHNESS FOR KICKER SLICK
gGGPUNrOZsk_9 THESE CARDS HAVE ADVANTAGES IN THAT THEY'RE COLORLESS AND CAN BE PLAYED IN ANY BACK FOR THE COST OF FOUR MAN EACH IN ANY COLOR
gGGPUNrOZsk_10 BUT THEY ALSO HAVE DISADVANTAGES OF BEING SUSCEPTIBLE TO A WIDE RANGE OF CARDS
gIp8qya-Zos_1 WHEN SHOW YOU HOW TO HAVE YOUR DOG SIT IN WE
gIp8qya-Zos_2 THIS IS A GREAT EXERCISE TO USE AT DOORWAYS TO ENSURE THE DOG IS NOT GUARDING OUTSIDE
gIp8qya-Zos_3 IT ALSO HAS NICE THE KING POLITE WHEN COMPANY COME TO THE DOOR ARE ANYTIME THAT YOU JUST NEEDS THAT WAY YOU WANT THE DOG TO REMAIN BEHIND
gIp8qya-Zos_4 WE'LL START WITH THE SIT POSITION SIT FACIAL TO HER NAME
gIp8qya-Zos_5 AGAIN THIS IS THE PLACEMENT
gIp8qya-Zos_7 WHEN I GET THIS HIM COMMANDS DISLIKE HEAVINESS STOP TO THE DOGS NOSE
gIp8qya-Zos_8 THEN I'M GOING TO STEP OFF ON MY RIGHT FOOT RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE DOG STEPPING AWAY AND THEN RETURN INTO THE DOG
gIp8qya-Zos_9 THAT'S THE WHOLE COMEDIAN
gIp8qya-Zos_10 ONCE I WALK SHE CAN GET OUT
gIp8qya-Zos_11 SHE DID GET UP A LITTLE EARLY SOME PLACE OR BACK INTO THE SET
gIp8qya-Zos_12 WAIT STEP IN FRONT STEPPING BACK AND THEN SHE CAN GO FORWARD
gIp8qya-Zos_13 IT'S A GREAT WAY TO ENSURE THAT YOUR DOG IS NOT TRIP NEW AT THE DOOR ARE THAT THEY ARE STAYING SAFE IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY MAY NOT BE COMFORTABLE
gIp8qya-Zos_14 SO PRACTICE OUR WHENEVER YOU GO OUT THE DOORWAY
gT35PHYO7rE_1 AND MY NAME'S ADDISON FROM CAPTAIN BILLS I'M AND TEACH YOU HOW TO RUN BASIC VOLLEYBALL DRILLS
gT35PHYO7rE_2 A MAIN DIFFERENT DRILLS YOU CAN USE TO PLAY OR PRACTICE VOLLEYBALL
gT35PHYO7rE_3 THEY'RE SERVING DRILLS PASSING DRILLS FITTING DRILLS AND SETTING CURLS
gT35PHYO7rE_4 FIRST ONE SERVING FILLS
gT35PHYO7rE_5 THE IMAGE KEY THING IN SERVING IS REPETITION AND IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN SINGER SERVE CONSISTENT
gT35PHYO7rE_6 SO IN SERVING WHICH WOMAN VISUAL HAVE BASKETBALLS TAKE THE BOTTOM FROM YOU TOSS IT UP AND FUN OF THE HIGH ENOUGH SEE OF TIME TO GET TO IT AND HIT IT WITH THE HAND
gT35PHYO7rE_7 HAND WANTS TO BE OPENED NEEDS TO BE OPEN A NEW ONE HIT IT WITH THE PALM OF YOUR HAND
gT35PHYO7rE_8 SO WHEN YOU HIT IT POSSIBLE ON FRIDAY YOU TAKE YOUR ARM BACK LEAD WITH THE ELBOW AND HIT WITH THE HAND OPEN AND AROUND FRONT OF YOU
gT35PHYO7rE_9 PASSING HERO'S FOOD YOU WOULD NEED OF SAUCER AND A PASSER AND THE TARGET
gT35PHYO7rE_10 SO THE TOSS OR WOOD TOSS THE BALL TO THE PASSER FASTER ONCE YOU GET BEHIND THE BALL FACE THE TARGET USE THE KNEES GET THERE BUT DOWN
gT35PHYO7rE_11 USE YOUR PLATFORM WHICH ARE ARMS ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER FOOT AND TOGETHER TO BUILD A PLATFORM
gT35PHYO7rE_12 WHEN PASSING THE BALL YOU ONE HIT IT BETWEEN YOUR WRISTS AND YOUR ELBOW
gT35PHYO7rE_13 I'M PASSING AND THE TOSS IT IN A PASS IT TO THE PATENT TOSS IT TO THE PASSER AND THEN THE PASSER WILL EITHER LAGS KEEP THE BUTT DOWN FACE THE TARGET TO TRY TO GET INTO THE TARGET
gT35PHYO7rE_14 REPETITION IS ALSO VERY EFFECTIVE AND PASSING DRILLS BECAUSE PASSING IS THE BACKBONE OF OLIVE OIL
gT35PHYO7rE_15 AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE VERY VERY CONSISTENT PASSER AND YOU WILL SUCCEED AND VOLATILE
gT35PHYO7rE_16 HITTING DRILLS YOU WILL HAVE A SETTER WHO WILL SET THE BALL TO THE HEADER
gT35PHYO7rE_17 NOW HITTING A NEW HITTING IT YOU WANT TO TAKE IT TO STEP APPROACH
gT35PHYO7rE_18 SO WHEN YOU DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU'RE LEFT HANDED ARE RIGHT HANDED YOU GOING TO ON STEP WITH THE OPPOSITE FOOT
gT35PHYO7rE_19 SO I'M RIGHT HANDED OMINOUS THAT FIRST WITH MY RIGHT FOOT THAT THEY GET TO STEP APPROACH RIGHT LEFT AND DOWN PUT MY HANDS BEHIND THE PALMS FACING UP AND IN ONE THUMB DOWN BRING MY HANDS UP TO BRING THAT KNEE UP HIGHER ABOVE THE GROUND AND THEN ON THAT AND DROP MY ELBOW LEAD WITH MY LEFT ARM AND SWING THROUGH THE BALL
gT35PHYO7rE_20 SO THE SET IT IN A SUCH A LOT YOU TAKE YOUR APPROACH JUMP UP AND HIT IT OVER THE NET
gT35PHYO7rE_21 THE NEXT DRILL IS SETTING DRILL SETTING DRILLS
gT35PHYO7rE_22 SETTING ON YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IF THAT'S YOU USE ALL FIVE OF YOUR FINGERS YOU WANT TO FINISH TO BE VERY VERY RELAXED
gT35PHYO7rE_23 SO WHEN YOU'RE SETTING THE BALL AND TAKE THE BALL AND SHAPE YOUR HANDS IN THE SHAPE OF A BALL
gT35PHYO7rE_24 SO WHEN YOU'RE SETTING THE BALL TAKE THE BALL ABOVE YOUR HEAD WHERE IF IF YOU MISS THE BALL OR HIDDEN FOREHEAD
gT35PHYO7rE_25 THE THING THE BALL AND SAYS THAT AN IN OUR THING HANDS VERY LONG ZOOMED IN OUR THINGS POSSIBLE
gT35PHYO7rE_26 ALSO MAKE SURE YOUR HANDS HAS THE BALL THE EXACT SAME TIME
gT35PHYO7rE_27 IF IT IS NOT THAT IS THAT'S IN TIME THAT IS AN ILLEGAL FIFTH CALLED A DOUBLE HAT
gT35PHYO7rE_28 SO IF MY HANDS DON'T HIT THE BALL THE EXACT SAME TIME IF AN ILLEGAL HAT
gT35PHYO7rE_29 SO SETTING DRILLS EVEN HAVE A TALL CERTAIN WILL TOSSING THE BALL AND YOU GET UNDER IT USUALLY LEGS THEY SHOULD TARGET AND ONE OF PUSH THE BALL OUT WITH THEIR LIGHT NOT ONLY ARE REST BUT YOUR LEGS ALSO AND FACIAL TARGET AND TIDY GIVEN THE TARGET
gT35PHYO7rE_30 ALL OF THESE DRILLS ARE NEEDED NEED TO HAVE REPETITION
gT35PHYO7rE_31 EACH DRILL YOU NEED TO WORK ON A DAILY TO BE CONSISTENCY SIX EVEN VOLATILE
gT35PHYO7rE_32 AND THAT'S HOW YOU RUN INVASIVE OLIVE OIL DRILLS
hcNnmqL5xUY_1 AND I'M TALKING ABOUT CIRCUIT BENDING
hcNnmqL5xUY_2 FOR THE LOOK OF THE CIRCUIT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON
hcNnmqL5xUY_3 AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THE EXCITING PART FOR ME WHICH IS ACTUALLY TAKING THIS CIRCUIT BUT MAKE SOUNDS AND MAKING A TACTILE INTERFACE
hcNnmqL5xUY_4 HERE I HAVE A KNOB WHICH IS CALLED ELECTRONICS LAND THE POTENTIALLY HONOR
hcNnmqL5xUY_5 YOU CAN BUY THESE ON LINE FROM ELECTRONIC SUPPLIERS OR FROM YOUR LOCAL ELECTRONICS NERD WEARS STORE
hcNnmqL5xUY_6 AND BASICALLY IT'S JUST A KNOT
hcNnmqL5xUY_7 YOU CAN EVEN TAKE THESE OUT OF OLD ELECTRONICS THAT HAVE KNOBS ON THEM
hcNnmqL5xUY_8 THIS ONE IS A TWO MEGA OHMS
hcNnmqL5xUY_9 YOU CAN SEE HERE THE PROBABLY IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE EVEN FOR ME HERE BUT SAYS TO MAT
hcNnmqL5xUY_10 AND THIS IS WHERE I RECOMMEND STARTING WITH THESE
hcNnmqL5xUY_11 ALL ELECTRONICS ON THE INTERNET HAS TWO MEG OUT POTS AS WE CALL THEM FOR WERE VERY LITTLE MONEY
hcNnmqL5xUY_12 WOMEN DO THEY FOUND IS NEAT POINT WHEN I WAS TOUCHING EARLIER WHERE THE RESISTS DIVINEY OF MY FINGER WAS CREATING A LITTLE BIT OF A PITCH BEND IN THE CIRCUIT
hcNnmqL5xUY_13 AND SO NOW I'M AND DO ANOTHER I'VE GOT THESE WIRES UP I'M GOING TO TRY ALLIGATOR CLIPPING THESE WIRES FROM THOSE POINTS FROM THE BEND POINT RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT HERE
hcNnmqL5xUY_14 AND THEN I CONNECT THEM UP TO TWO POINTS ON THIS THE TENSION ON
hcNnmqL5xUY_15 WINNER AND THE TENSION ON IT OR HAS AN WIRES ON IT
hcNnmqL5xUY_16 A KNOT IN WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW
hcNnmqL5xUY_17 I AM JUST ALLIGATOR CLIPPING IN YOU REALLY ONLY NEED TWO POINTS ON THE POTENTIAL HONOR
hcNnmqL5xUY_18 IF I CLICK THAT TO THIS SIDE AND TO THE MIDDLE THEN THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WOULD BE THAT I WOULD TURN IT THE OTHER WAY THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO GET THE DESIRED EFFECT
hcNnmqL5xUY_19 SO YOU JUST CLIP IT'S YOU ONE POINT ON THE SIDE AND ONE ON THE METAL UNLESS FIRE IT OFF
hcNnmqL5xUY_20 SO NOW IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING NORMALLY BUT I'M IN A TURN THIS CONTROL AND WE GET TO A HAS A SO THAT ONE'S A GOOD ONE
hcNnmqL5xUY_21 THEN THE OTHER ONE I FOUND I'M GOING TO DISCONNECT THESE ALLIGATOR CLIPS FLOWS THAT LEDGE POINT KNEES ARE REALLY EXCITING
hcNnmqL5xUY_22 I FOUND THAT THIS ONE'S PROBABLY THE BASS WHAT ALL I HAVE TO DO IS TOUCH THESE WIRES NOW
hcNnmqL5xUY_23 AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IS MY BODY BECOMES A PART OF THE CIRCUIT AGE BY TOUCHING TO GATHER HER HINGE HAND IT CHANGES THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THERE
hcNnmqL5xUY_24 SO I'VE CREATED AND NOT CONTROL AND A BODY CONTACT THAT I CAN TOUCH HIGH AND NOW I HAVE A WAY OF ACTUALLY PLAYING THIS ELECTRONIC MUSICAL INSTRUMENT

h4yPvfISDyA_1 IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW ARM MOTIONS AFFECT OUR DIET IN OUR HEALTH
h4yPvfISDyA_2 IT'S ALL THIS IS A HUGE CATEGORY WOULD TALK ABOUT HOW IT AFFECTS THE THINGS THAT WE
h4yPvfISDyA_3 SO IN CHINESE MEDICINE WE LOOK AT THE FIVE ELEMENTS OF THE FIVE MAIN ORGANS
h4yPvfISDyA_4 THE HEART IS LEAN ALONG THE KIDNEY AND THE LIVER
h4yPvfISDyA_5 AND EACH ONE OF THOSE ORGANS WE ACTUALLY A RELATED A MINUTE AND A MOTION WITH
h4yPvfISDyA_6 THE WITH THE SPLEEN WHICH WE KNOW IS ALL ABOUT OUR DIGESTION
h4yPvfISDyA_7 WE ASSOCIATE WORRY
h4yPvfISDyA_8 WITH THE LIVER ONE OF THE ORGANS AND REALLY HAS A HUGE EFFECT PROMOTIONS MIXED UP WE LOOK AT IS STRESS
h4yPvfISDyA_9 IN MID IN MIXED WITH THAT WE SEE DEPRESSION IRRITABILITY ANGER AND SO FORTH
h4yPvfISDyA_10 WHAT I TELL PEOPLE WHEN YOU'RE DIETING SO OFTEN WHEN WORRY ABOUT THE FOODS THAT WE EAT THAT WE HAD A SMALL SQUARE OF CHOCOLATE MOLLISON WE HAVE ALL THOSE DEAL TO WE WORRY ABOUT HOW IT'S GOING TO AFFECT US
h4yPvfISDyA_11 THAT A MOTION OF WORRY IN WILL AFFECT THE WAY ARE SPLEEN FUNCTIONS
h4yPvfISDyA_12 WITH IT NOT OUR STOMACH UP SO THAT THE DIGESTION CAN'T AFFORD TO EXTRACT THAT ENERGY THAT SHE FROM
h4yPvfISDyA_13 IN THE SAME WAY THAT IF WE STRESS IN WE HAVE STRESS AND WORK STRESS OUR LIFE THAT WILL FIND THAT THERE'S AN INTERACTION BETWEEN BOTH THE LIVER AND IT'S LEANING THAT WILL CAUSE ARE DIGESTION AGAIN NOT TO BE GOOD
h4yPvfISDyA_14 AND SO WE KNOW THAT WE CAN BE SO STRESS THAT WE ACTUALLY GET NAUSEOUS SOMETIMES
h4yPvfISDyA_15 WE FEEL OUR STOMACH NOT ENOUGH

h4yPvfISDyA_17 WE JUST CAN'T DO IT CONSTANTLY AND IT'S ALL ABOUT PORTION SIZE
h4yPvfISDyA_18 SO A SMALL PIECE OF CHOCOLATE NOT THE WHOLE CHALK WITH BAR

ggOK7FgqROs_4 YOU KNOW YOU TAKE OUT LOHNER YOU IN A BALL MONEY FROM YOUR RELATIVES HIGH IN OF FIRST YOU KNOW GET GET EVERYTHING DON'T
ggOK7FgqROs_5 SOME OTHER DIFFICULTIES IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY IS THE FACT THAT A LOT OF MUSIC UNFORTUNATELY ISN'T SUCCESSFUL
ggOK7FgqROs_6 A IN A LOT ARTISTS OUT THERE AND THEY'RE TRYING BUT MAYBE NOT MARKETED RIGHT OR MAYBE A MANAGEMENT IS A RARE MAYBE THEY'RE NOT AN TORME THAT IS MUSIC IS NOT GOOD
ggOK7FgqROs_7 SO YOU KNOW AS A PRODUCE THE RELIEVE THE PICK AND CHOOSE WHO YOU WORK WITH AND A LOT OF TIMES IS NO WAY THAT NO WAY TO REALLY TELL YOU KNOW WHAT CAN BE SUCCESSFUL WITH NOT CAN BE SUCCESSFUL SO IT'S SORT OF A GAMBLE YOU KNOW ON EACH PROJECTS WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW YOU CAN GET PAID OF ITS CAN BE SUCCESS

gh0vsBwlJcQ_13 AND AS A FAMILY MEMBER YOU MIGHT NEED SOME SUPPORT AS WELL SO
gh0vsBwlJcQ_14 MAKE SURE THAT YOUR WHOLE WHOLE BUT NOT TO THE POINT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL OR BECOMING OVERBEARING BECAUSE ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS ABOUT OCD ISN'T THE INDIVIDUAL LOSES EVERY SENSE OF CONTROL THAT THEY HALF ARE THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE CONTROL

HDsCNrtgSrk_1 HI THIS IS JON AND IN THIS CLIP I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT USING SHARP BLADES
HDsCNrtgSrk_2 BEFORE YOU PERFORM ANY CUTTING TASK YOU ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BLADE ON YOUR PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IS SHARP END IN PROPER WORKING CONDITION
HDsCNrtgSrk_3 IF THE BLADE IS DOLE THE WOODWORKERS GOING HAVE TO WORK HARDER TO MAKE A CUT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PUSH THAT BOARD IN JUST A LITTLE BIT HARDER AND THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT THE BLADE WILL BLIND THE PIECE OF WOOD WILL KICK BACK OR POTENTIALLY THE BLADE WILL EVEN BREAK I COME THIS SEND LATE ON THE SCROLL SAW
HDsCNrtgSrk_4 ADDITIONALLY IF YOU HAVE A SHARP BLADE YOU'RE GOING TO PRODUCE A MUCH CLEANER FASTER BETTER LOOKING CUTS
HDsCNrtgSrk_5 NOW THIS ALSO GOES FOR SAND IT OR YOU WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOUR SAND PAPER ON YOUR SANDED MACHINE HAS A GOOD STRONG GRIP ON IT
HDsCNrtgSrk_6 IF IT'S WORN DOWN TOO MUCH IT'LL JUST POLISHING BUFF AND POTENTIALLY BURN THE PROJECT THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON
HDsCNrtgSrk_7 NOW EVEN WITH LADY EAVE TIGHT TOOLS YOU WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE BLADES ON THOSE ARE SHARP AS WELL
HDsCNrtgSrk_8 AS YOU'RE WORKING ON THE LATHE IF YOU DO HAVE A DULL BLADE AGAIN IT'S GETTING GIVE YOU A BAD CUTS BUT ALSO THERE'S MORE CHANCE OF IT GETTING CAUGHT ON THE WOOD AND TAKING THAT BACK AT SHOE
HDsCNrtgSrk_9 NOW EVEN TOOLS AS SIMPLE AS A CHISEL IF THE BLADE IS DOLE IT WILL CAUSE YOU TO WORK A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO MAKE THAT CUTS AND IT MIGHT POTENTIALLY SLIP AND COULD CAUSE YOU INJURY
GoV9Ng9VBIM_1 THIS IS JOHN THEN A BROKEN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I AM INVITING YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR SERIES OF INTERMEDIATE STAGES OF ENCAUSTIC PAINTING
GoV9Ng9VBIM_2 I HAVE A FAVORITE PHRASE THAT GIVES ME GOING ALL KINDS OF DIRECTION
GoV9Ng9VBIM_3 <UNK> AND GO SEVEN LIKE THIS I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF AND THEN I WONDER HER FOR THAT LITTLE THOUGHT TAKES ME AND IN THIS CASE IF HE GOT ME THINKING ABOUT HOW CAN I MULTIPLY THE TOOLS THAT I HAVE TO MAKE MANY MORE TOOLS OUT OF THE ONE TOOL
GoV9Ng9VBIM_4 AND LET IT GET ME THINKING WAS WHAT IF I TOOK A PIECE OF A COPPER FOIL LEDGE AND GET IT A CRAFT STORE
GoV9Ng9VBIM_5 COMES IN DIFFERENT THICKNESSES YOU IN A ROLE IN A TUBE AND YOU'D UNROLL IT LAY IT OUT AND I TOOK THE IRON AND LAID IT DOWN ON TOP OF THE COPPER MAKE TRACED AROUND IT WITH A PENCIL AND THIS IS SO FIN THAT YOU CAN CUT IT WITH A PAIR OF SCISSORS
GoV9Ng9VBIM_6 SO AFTER I CUT AND I MADE SURE I LEFT LITTLE TABS OF AROUND THE PATTERN OF SO THAT WHEN I PUT THE IRON ON HERE I COULD THEN JUST SNAP IT RIGHT ON TO THE EYE AND
GoV9Ng9VBIM_7 WHAT WAS CLIMBER ABOUT THIS IS THAT THIS KOFFLER SO THIS OFF YOU CAN SCORE THE COPPER WITH THE TOOL
GoV9Ng9VBIM_8 IT'S CALLED EMBOSSING
GoV9Ng9VBIM_9 SO WE CAN EMBOSSED PATTERNS ON TO THE PLATE AND THEY'LL SHOW UP ON THE OTHER SIDE SO THAT WHEN YOU'RE USING THE IRON WITH THE WAX ENYEART LAYING A DOWN PICKING IT UP YOU'RE GETTING A SLOW PATTERN TRANSFERRED ON TO THE WAX
GoV9Ng9VBIM_10 NOW I HANDY LITTLE THING IS IS THAT I THINK I SAID BEFORE THAT THIS LITTLE PIN POINT IF YOU DROP IT YOU KNOW MESS UP THE POINT AND LITTLE BAND LIKE THIS ONE HAPPENS TO BE BENT
GoV9Ng9VBIM_11 INSTEAD OF THROWING AWAY I TOOK SOME THIS LITTLE PIECES OF COPPER SLIPPED IT INTO THE LITTLE BENT PIECE OF THE PAN POINT AND MADE A LITTLE FOOT THAT I CAN ALSO USE WITH THE WAX
GoV9Ng9VBIM_12 JUST ANOTHER WAY TO MULTIPLY YOUR TOOLS

hH6Ve6SuyWI_1 HI THIS IS DAVID JACKEL ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT CONVERTING MEATY FILES TO AUDIO FILES IN GARAGE BAND
hH6Ve6SuyWI_2 ANOTHER REASON YOU WOULD WANT TO TAKE A MIDI FILE IN CONVERTED TO AN AUDIO FILE IS THAT IT'S MUCH LESS OF A DRAIN ON YOUR COMPUTER
hH6Ve6SuyWI_3 BECAUSE MANY FILES ARE COMPLETELY SOFTWARE INSTRUMENTS ARE MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAT YOU GET MEMORY AND A SLOW DOWN A SONG
hH6Ve6SuyWI_4 WE USE SETTLE ON HOW YOU WANT THE MIDI FILE TO BE CONVERT INTO AN AUDIO FILE TO MAKE IT MUCH LESS OF A DURING YOUR COMPUTER
hH6Ve6SuyWI_5 SO LET'S SAY ONE AND JUST ANOTHER LOOP BUT I DON'T WANT IT TO BE I'M AS A MIDI FILE WHAT I DO IS I DON'T GARAGE BAND SLIP PREFERENCES GO INTO LOOPS UP HERE TO WHERE IT SAYS ENDING LOOPS TO TIME LINE
hH6Ve6SuyWI_6 I SELECT CONVERT TO REAL INSTRUMENT TO COME OUT STRAIGHT OUT SO THIS IS LOOP RIGHT HERE THAT I WILL USE OR GO AROMATHERAPY CONTAINS LIKE THE KITTY AND DRAG IT OVER YOUR AND NOW AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S BLUE NOT GREEN
hH6Ve6SuyWI_7 GREEN MEANS MILTIE BLUE MEANS REAL AUDIO ARE OH <UNK> AND IN THAT WAY AS I CONTINUE TO AN LOOP SECOND DO SO IN THE WAY THAT ISN'T CAN SLOW DOWN MY COMPUTER AND MAKE IT FREEZE

GNQFRoOBU6o_7 IF USING MATH EQUATION IS WAY TOO COMPLICATED FOR YOU YOU CAN GO TO VARIOUS WEBSITES ON THE INNER THAT YOU'RE IN A PRESS IN BMI THERE TO COME UP WITH A CALCULATOR AND THEY'RE CAN HELP YOU GET THROUGH IT
GNQFRoOBU6o_8 WE'RE JUST GONNA PUNCH IN YOUR HEIGHT AND YOUR WEIGHT AND NOW FIGURE IT OUT FOR YOU AUTOMATICALLY

Hi_JTPFkX9c_6 AND THEN ON THE PATIENTS INSTRUCTED DISCHARGE SHOWERING IN BEING IS ACTIVE AS POSSIBLE
Hi_JTPFkX9c_7 AND THEN GENERALLY WE START THE PATIENT ON AN UP MASSAGE ROUTINE WITH THE IMPLANTS ARE MOVED IMMOBILIZED A BIT TO HELP THEM TO ACCOMMODATE TO THE SPACE IT'S BEEN CREATED BENEATH THE MUSCLE
Hi_JTPFkX9c_8 AT THAT POINT THE ASIAN IS GENERALLY OFF PAIN MEDICINE AND COMPLETING A SHORT COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS IN STARTING TO GET BACK TO THE NORMAL ROUTINE
Hi_JTPFkX9c_9 THEY HAVE A POSTS SURGICAL BROUGHT WHICH IS A SOFT SPORTS TYPE DRAW AND WE HAVE THE PATIENT WHERE THAT PRETTY MUCH FULL TIME FOR THE FIRST WEEK OR SO AND THEN GRADUALLY TO LEAN OFF OF THAT AND THEN INTO A NORMAL BRA SHORTLY THEREAFTER

Gtm13n0R0O4_1 WHEN THEY ARE IN THE BATH TOWEL RIGORS HITTING A BATH THERE A COUPLE THINGS TO CONSIDER
Gtm13n0R0O4_2 FIRST OF ALL OF THE WATER TEMPERATURE
Gtm13n0R0O4_3 THE HIGHER THE WATER THE MORE LIKE THERE'S GOING TO BE A REACTION WITH YOUR ECZEMA
Gtm13n0R0O4_4 IT CAN CAUSE VERY BAD ITCHINESS UNDERSTAND RIGHT IN YOUR SKIN
Gtm13n0R0O4_5 THE HE GETS CHECKED NEARBY FROM HOT WATER AND THEY CAN SPARK OF FLARE OUT
Gtm13n0R0O4_6 SO WHAT YOU YOUR BEST BET IS THE USE OF LUKE WARM BATH AND NOT STAY IN IT TOO LONG

Gtm13n0R0O4_8 WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH LOVE THIS CAN ESPECIALLY IF YOU DO HAVE ANNEXING FLARE UP YOU DON'T WANT TO USE ANYTHING TOO ROUGH AGAINST THE SKIN
Gtm13n0R0O4_9 SO USING A WASHCLOTH IS NOT A GOOD IDEA
Gtm13n0R0O4_10 AND FLATTEN DOES OF THE CONES OR ON YOUR HAND AND USE THAT SLAVE OF YOUR BODY IN ORDER TO CUT YOURSELF
Gtm13n0R0O4_11 THAT WAY YOU WON'T HAVE ANY REACTION OR ANY KIND OF ABRASION ON THE SKIN BECAUSE WHAT THE ACT ONE DOES ONCE YOU START STRETCHING IT YOU'RE CREATING LITTLE ABRASIONS NEAR SCAN SCRATCHES THEY HATS MAJOR SKIN EVEN IT'S YEAR WHICH REGULAR SCRATCH IT MORE

gsit1xgHHWE_11 LET'S PLAY SOME COOL
Hiri9RuDjec_1 HI
Hiri9RuDjec_2 I'M BEN ANDERSON WITH EXPERT VILLAGE I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT I IN IN LIFE KEYBOARD SETTING
Hiri9RuDjec_3 OF A LOT OF KEYBOARD IS A LOT OF MUSICIANS UP TEN TEND TO FEEL WHEN THEY'RE PLAYING IN A LIVE BAND THAT THEY NEED TO PLAY BE GETTING TO BE PLAYING ALL THE TIME AND NOT READING REALLY ISN'T ALWAYS THE CASE
Hiri9RuDjec_4 IT'S IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT SET TO REMEMBER WHAT'S WHAT'S APPROPRIATE OF <UNK> IN THIS SITUATION A SONG ON AND THAT'S THE TERM AND BUY A DYNAMIC LEVELS DYNAMIC LEVELS ARE VERY IMPORTANT OF THERE A LOT OF TIMES LIGHTLY KEY WORDS THAT I DON'T PLAY ON STAGE WHILE THE OTHER MUSICIANS APPLYING AND THAT'S BECAUSE BY PLAYING KEYBOARD I'M NOT REALLY ADDING ANYTHING EXTRA TO THE SONG AND THE SOUND OF THE PIECE AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENTS
Hiri9RuDjec_5 IT'S NOT TO SAY THE KEYBOARD ISN'T POURING KEY PORTION OF THE PLATE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO DETERMINE WHEN KEYBOARD IS APPROPRIATE AND WHEN IT'S NOT
Hiri9RuDjec_6 FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF DURING ONE SONG ON TO MY BANDS THERE'S THE A MOMENT WHERE IT THE SONG IT CAN A QUIET AND REALLY KIND OF RHYTHMIC ON AND IT'S HARD FOR ME TO IT'S IT'S OF TO FIT ALONG WITHOUT WITH THE REST THE INSURANCE DURING THE SONGS BECAUSE OF THE STYLE THE SONG SO I CUT OUT I DON'T PLAY AND IT'S ONLY FOR A FEW MEASURES AND IT REALLY DOESN'T IN DOESN'T MATTER NEW
Hiri9RuDjec_7 IT GIVES ME A MOMENT TO SIT AND THINKING REMEMBER WHAT I HAVE TO DO LATER ON IN THE SONG
Hiri9RuDjec_8 SO IT'S IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK OF WHAT IS REALLY NECESSARY TO THAT SONG
Hiri9RuDjec_9 JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN PLAY AND YOU CAN PLAY ANYTHING DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO PLAY ALL THE TIME
Hiri9RuDjec_10 AGAIN IT'S ALL ABOUT EMPHASIZING AND SUPPORTING THE SONG AND SUPPORTING THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY THERE
Hiri9RuDjec_11 WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS IS THE SONG
Hiri9RuDjec_12 IT'S NOT IMPORTANT IS AS WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING IN WHAT YOUR NECESSARILY CONTRIBUTING TO IT
Hiri9RuDjec_13 IT'S ALL ABOUT ADDING EVERYTHING INTO IT TO FIT IN INTO MAKE MAKE A PERFECT SONG
Hiri9RuDjec_14 THERE ARE OTHER MOMENTS WHEN YOU MIGHT BE PLAYING ALONG WITH THE BAND AND FOR SOME REASON IT DOESN'T REALLY SOUND RIGHT EAR MITES UNCLUTTERED MIGHT SOUND SOMEWHAT THERE'S TOO MUCH GOING ON ON IT AND THAT'S ANOTHER IT ANOTHER WAY TO SHOW THE KNEE YOU PLAYING THERE REALLY IS AN APPROPRIATE WITH THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS
Hiri9RuDjec_15 IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WHAT EVERY OTHER INSTRUMENT IS DOING BY ITSELF COMPARED TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WELL
GSTkDCgtqdQ_1 OKAY NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT TO DO IF YOU SEE DON'T COME OFF OR EQUALLY AS COMMON IF TOO MANY SEED COME OUT
GSTkDCgtqdQ_2 COMMON PROBLEM PEOPLE GET OVER ENTHUSIASTIC BAIT PLANT TOO MANY SEED
GSTkDCgtqdQ_3 AND ALSO ANOTHER COMMON PROBLEM PEOPLE GET EITHER OVER RANCHUS OR NERVOUS AND THEY THINK THEY'RE SEAT IS DEAD IN HASN'T COME UP IS NOT GOING TO GERMINATE
GSTkDCgtqdQ_4 WELL OFTENTIMES ESPECIALLY IN THE COOL KNIGHTS OF EARLY SPRING IF YOU SEE DOES OUT HERE THE GERMINATION WILL BE SLIGHTLY RETARDED SO YOU NEED TO GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE TIME
GSTkDCgtqdQ_5 IF AND OUT YOU CAN APPLY SOME HEAT TO THE BOTTOMS OF THE POTS BUT IN GENERAL THESE COLD HARDY CROPS WILL GERMINATE JUST FINE IN MARCH EVEN IN NEW ENGLAND
GSTkDCgtqdQ_6 SO LET'S TALK ABOUT TOO MANY
GSTkDCgtqdQ_7 THERE WE SEE A POT OF OREGANO
GSTkDCgtqdQ_8 A LITTLE FROST DAMAGE THAT THEY'RE STILL PLENTY OF LIVING A RULE IN THERE
GSTkDCgtqdQ_9 I'M AN X A RULER HATER NOW CONVERTED
GSTkDCgtqdQ_10 WAY TO LEARN TO LIKE A RULER IS SEATED IN THE WINTER
GSTkDCgtqdQ_11 IT'S MUCH TASTE YOUR SWEET DELICIOUS AND NOT SO PEPPERY
GSTkDCgtqdQ_12 SO HERE WE HAVE MAYBE A HUNDRED MORE PLANTS
GSTkDCgtqdQ_13 WE DON'T WANT A WAIST THEM IS NOT ENOUGH SPACE IN THERE FOR THE MALL TO DEVELOP SO IF THAT IT CAN SEE THIS IS SLOW PRACTICALLY ROOT BOUND
GSTkDCgtqdQ_14 WE CAN EASILY SUBDIVIDE THE CLUMPS CAN TAKE THIS AND TURN IT INTO IF ALL ONE CLUMP
HbkcT1XzmAk_1 MY NAME IS ANTHONY MALONEY ANIMISTS TALK ABOUT HOW TO START A SMALL BUSINESS THING OF PHOTOGRAPHY
HbkcT1XzmAk_2 WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A SMALL VISITS HAVE PHOTOGRAPHY YOU PROBABLY THINK ABOUT WELL FOOD FROM IF AN EVENT PHOTOGRAPHER I CAN TAKE IMAGES OF PEOPLE THAT ONE A BECOME MODELS OR I CAN FAKE IMAGES OF PEOPLE AND THEY'RE PATHS
HbkcT1XzmAk_3 SO THERE'S ALL TYPES OF WAYS THAT YOU COULD START A SMALL BUSINESS IN PHOTOGRAPHY
HbkcT1XzmAk_4 ONE THING THAT YOU ALSO WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS ILLEGAL RAMIFICATIONS OF STARTING SMALL BUSINESS
HbkcT1XzmAk_5 YOU WANT A DOWN AND GET YOU KNOW BASICALLY A SMALL BUSINESS LICENSE FOR TAX PURPOSES
HbkcT1XzmAk_6 IT REALLY MANA OF FIRST THINK ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT BECAUSE IF YOUR SMALL BUSINESS TAKES OFF AND YOU NOT YOU KNOW REALLY A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS YOU MIGHT RUN SOME LEGAL PROBLEMS DOWN THE ROW
HbkcT1XzmAk_7 I'VE SET ONE AN INSTANCE YOU MIGHT SERVE THINK ABOUT HOW TO START A SMALL BUSINESS
HbkcT1XzmAk_8 THE OTHER IS RESEARCH
HbkcT1XzmAk_9 DO SOME RESEARCH INTO OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES IN YOUR AREA
HbkcT1XzmAk_10 AND THEY CAN BE PHOTOGRAPHY BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE
HbkcT1XzmAk_11 THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT YOU KNOW IF WAYS THAT SMALL BUSINESSES WORK IN FOR ME ONE THING I LIKE TO LOOK AT OUR SMALL RESTAURANTS MOM POP SHOPS
HbkcT1XzmAk_12 I DID THEY START UP
HbkcT1XzmAk_13 HOW MUCH MONEY DID THE KNEE
HbkcT1XzmAk_14 AN INSURANCE THAT THEY NEED
HbkcT1XzmAk_15 <UNK> STAFF THAT THEY HAVE
HbkcT1XzmAk_16 HOW DEDICATED AND HOW TO ORGANIZE WHERE THEY WHEN THEY STARTED
HbkcT1XzmAk_17 AND USUALLY IN OTHERS A PRETTY BIG DIFFERENCE IN STARTING THAT SAID DINER AND STARTING PHOTOGRAPHY BUSINESS WOMAN YOU REALLY LOOK AT IT IS REALLY NOT THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE
HbkcT1XzmAk_18 IT'S A LOT OF ADVERTISING A LOT OF WORD OF MOUTH A LOT OF REALLY PROFESSIONALISM IN JUST YOU KNOW WHAT GOES ON WITH YOUR INTERACTION WITH YOUR CLIENTS
HbkcT1XzmAk_19 AND SO IT'S ALSO INCREDIBLY HEART
HbkcT1XzmAk_20 MOST RESTAURANTS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EXACT PERCENTAGES BUT THE FAN AT ALL
HbkcT1XzmAk_21 THEY DON'T REALLY IT'S CLOTH BUSINESS AND SO IS PHOTOGRAPHY
HbkcT1XzmAk_22 IT LOOKS FUN AND BY HOW MANY GET PAID FOR DOING SOMETHING I LOVE TO DO FOR FUN
HbkcT1XzmAk_23 AND YOU REALLY GET INTO THE BUSINESS ASPECT OF IT IT'S NOT REALLY FUN
HbkcT1XzmAk_24 IT'S A LOT OF WORK WHICH FOR SOME PEOPLE IS FINE
HbkcT1XzmAk_25 FOR ME AND WORK IS ON
HbkcT1XzmAk_26 BUT IT'S REALLY THE BASIC FOUNDATIONS OF HAS START ANY SMALL BUSINESS
HbkcT1XzmAk_27 THEY'RE GREAT BOOKS AT LIBRARIES AND HAD IT REALLY I THINK THERE'S EVEN ON HOW TO START A SMALL BUSINESS BOAT
HbkcT1XzmAk_28 IN A FIRST ABOUT THESE ARE FAIRLY REALLY USE LISTING OF THAT NONE OF THAT THAT THEM THEY REALLY IMPORTANT
HbkcT1XzmAk_29 AND AGAIN IT IS RESEARCH AND TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE THAT STARTED SMALL BUSINESSES
HbkcT1XzmAk_30 AND YOU NOT TO REALLY WANT TO TALK TO THE PHOTOGRAPHER THAT YOU MIGHT BE COMPETING WITH BECAUSE HE'S NOT FOR SHE'S NOT REALLY A NATALIA YET DO IT
HbkcT1XzmAk_31 SO BE GREAT
HbkcT1XzmAk_32 YOU KNOW COMPETITIONS PRETTY GOOD SOMETIMES FOR CERTAIN THICK PHOTOGRAPHY AND POPPING OPTICIAN OF PHOTOGRAPHY IS AN AWESOME THIGH
HbkcT1XzmAk_33 BUT ANYWAY YOU WON'T LOOK AT OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES IN YOUR AREA AND HOW THEY STARTED
HbkcT1XzmAk_34 AND THAT'S HOW I WOULD START SMALL BUSINESS FIVE
hiqk6x1HnHU_1 WE'RE GONNA TALK A FEW TIMES A FEW MORE TIMES ABOUT THE WILLARD FAMILY IN MENTION VARIOUS NAMES AND WHAT THEY DID
hiqk6x1HnHU_2 EARLY ON HOWEVER THEY WERE OUT THERE IN THE COUNTRY
hiqk6x1HnHU_3 THEY WERE MAKING NO TOO MANY CLOCKS FOR RIDGE FEET ON THE CITY
hiqk6x1HnHU_4 SO TO GET A A A BIG IN SANTA FOR THEM TO TRY TO MAKE CLOCKS ARE INEXPENSIVE
hiqk6x1HnHU_5 THAT THAT YOU HAVE TO BE THAT RICH TO OWN
hiqk6x1HnHU_6 THEY WERE IN AND THEN THE FAMILY
hiqk6x1HnHU_7 AND AGAIN THE OUT THERE IN THE COUNTRY NOT THE NOT UNDER THE OF THE PRESSURE'S OF CITY LIFE AND THEY COULD THINK ABOUT HOW THEY COULD DO AN INEXPENSIVE CLOCK
hiqk6x1HnHU_8 THIS IS CALLED THE GRAFTON TIME PIECE OF BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY WERE WORKING OF THEIR THEIR HOMES DEADENS PICTURE YOU SAW
hiqk6x1HnHU_9 GRAFTON TIME TIMEPIECE THESE ARE RARE AN EXPENSIVE
hiqk6x1HnHU_10 UH GAGNON I CAN FIND THESE AT A FLEA MARKET
hiqk6x1HnHU_11 AND IF ONE COMES UP FOR SALES PROBABLY CAN IT BE A MANY MANY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
hiqk6x1HnHU_12 BUT USUALLY SNOW WHAT IT IS IN NO TO APPRECIATE IT WHEN YOU SEE ONE SOMEWHERE
hiqk6x1HnHU_13 THE ON ONE THING YOU MAY NOTICE IS THE FORM
hiqk6x1HnHU_14 IF YOU LOOK FROM HERE ON OUT YOU BASICALLY HAVE A BRACKET CLAW
hiqk6x1HnHU_15 SO THE IDEA THAT WE'RE WORKING FROM THAT MODEL OF A BRACKET CLOCK
hiqk6x1HnHU_16 THE MAIN SPRINGS WE'RE EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULTY MANUFACTURER
hiqk6x1HnHU_17 SO THEY WERE STILL DEALING WITH WEIGHT DRIVEN CLOCKS THE WEIGHT HANGING UNDERNEATH THE CLOCK WHICH POWERS IT
hiqk6x1HnHU_18 SO THEY NEED TO DO SOMETHING UNDERNEATH BOTH THE AS A DECORATIVE FEATURE INTO IN CLOSE THE WEIGHT INSIDES OF WAS AN OUNCE WEENIE IN THE AIR
hiqk6x1HnHU_19 THIS IS A AGAIN AS I TALKED ABOUT YOU CAN TELL IMMEDIATELY THIS IS A SINGLE OF WIND
hiqk6x1HnHU_20 SO THIS IS THE TIME PEAS IN IT SOMETIMES CALLED GRAFTON TIME PIECES
hiqk6x1HnHU_21 BUT THEN IS A WAIT A MINUTE LOVE YOU TELL ME OF TIMEPIECE DOESN'T STRIKE AND I SEE A HAMMER DEVELOP THERE
hiqk6x1HnHU_22 THE WAY THE SOAP WORKED WITH <UNK> WAS AND HEART RATE OF BEING A STRIKING CLOCK WILL WITHOUT ALL THE ACTOR EXPANDS
hiqk6x1HnHU_23 IF THEY HAVE WITH CALL THE PASSING STRIKE WITH THE OUT WHEN THE MINUTE HAND PAST THE OUR WHICH IS LIFT THE HAMMER OUT AND LET IT FALL AND THE BELL ONE TIME
hiqk6x1HnHU_24 THE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TIME IT WAS BUT YOU KNOW THAT ANOTHER HOUR OF YOUR LIFE IT IS THAT BY

grp-q-hxxeQ_4 WALK A SILK ROCK IS ACTUALLY THE TECHNICAL NAME FOR YOUR FAUCET OUTSIDE
grp-q-hxxeQ_5 SO ANYTIME YOU WANT TO GO TO A HARDWARE STORE LOOKING FOR PARTS IF YOU REFER TO IT IS A SILCOX WILL BE ABLE TO MORE FULLY DIRECT YOU WHERE THOSE PARTS ARE

grp-q-hxxeQ_7 NOW INSIDE THE SILCOX IS JUST A FEW DIFFERENT WORKINGS
grp-q-hxxeQ_8 ON THE MAIN ONE WHEN I PULLED MISSING A PART IS WILL BE ALONG ARE IN THE CENTER OF ITS AND THEY'LL BE OF WASHER AND THIS IS REALLY WILL ORGAN WANNA LOOK FOR
HIRQLSfYWEg_1 YOU SEE ONE OF THE MOST BASIC AN IMPORTANT POINTS AND MAKING A TALL IS TO COMMUNICATE
HIRQLSfYWEg_2 AND IF YOU BE QUIET IN YOUR TALK IF YOU'VE CLAD WHAT WITH YOUR VOICE IF YOU'RE REALLY REALLY TO SHOT SO THAT YOU CAN'T IS THE FAT OUT EVERYONE HAS BEEN IN THE LEANING OVER AND WONDERING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
HIRQLSfYWEg_3 AND IT'S JUST AS BAD AS THAT CONSTRUCTION DIE HAMMERING ON HIS HAMMER AND INTERFERING WITH EVERY WORD THAT YOU AT TO SAY
HIRQLSfYWEg_4 SO ONCE AGAIN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR AUDIENCE IS INTERESTED IN WHAT WERE SAYING SO WE WANT TO SPEAK OUT LOUDER
HIRQLSfYWEg_5 IS THAT BETTER
HIRQLSfYWEg_8 DON'T WITH GREAT HELLO
_Gy2B1z9lJk_1 WE JUST TALKED ABOUT PADDLING ON EDGE IN A CIRCLE BUT WHEN YOU GO DOWN THE RIVER YOU YOU DON'T ALWAYS GO IN ONE DIRECTION
_Gy2B1z9lJk_2 SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SWITCH DIRECTIONS THE OTHER WAYS YOU CAN CIRCLE IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
_Gy2B1z9lJk_3 IT'S CALLED SWITCHING EDGES IT'S REALLY OLD ALL ABOUT TIMING AND LOOKING RING ONE AGO
_Gy2B1z9lJk_4 SO WANT UPON AWAY FROM YOU AND I DO A FIGURE EIGHT

HeBySQSIl5k_1 IN THIS SERIES OR EVEN THE TURNING HOW TO JUGGLE THREE BALLS
HeBySQSIl5k_2 WE STARTED WITH JUST A SINGLE BALL
HeBySQSIl5k_3 LEARNING THE TIMING IN THE HIGH HAT NEED TO MAKE
HeBySQSIl5k_4 TO THROW A THREE BALL AT
HeBySQSIl5k_5 SO IN THIS THE THROWS GO FROM YOUR FOR YOUR AND TO A QUARTER OF A BOX
HeBySQSIl5k_6 IMMEDIATELY OVER YOUR OTHER HAND
HeBySQSIl5k_7 CATCH ON THE OUTSIDE BRING IT BACK TO THE BOX AND AGAIN
HeBySQSIl5k_8 THEN WE ADDED THE SECOND BALL AND TRY THE SAME THING
HeBySQSIl5k_9 THIS THE PATTERN IS THROW THROW CATCH CATCH
HeBySQSIl5k_10 WE WILL TRY TO KEEP IT RIGHT ON THAT
HeBySQSIl5k_11 THROW THROW CATCH CATCH
HeBySQSIl5k_12 PRACTICE DOING THIS BOTH WAYS IN CLEANING THIS UP ALONG
HeBySQSIl5k_13 WE ADD THE THIRD BALL AND PAT IT WILL JUST BE SOLID THROWS
HeBySQSIl5k_14 ACTUALLY THROW THROW THROW THROW
HeBySQSIl5k_15 IF YOU TRY AND REALLY BE CLOSE TO THE SAME RHYTHM
HeBySQSIl5k_16 SO THAT YOU MAKE THROWS ON BEAT EVERY TIME
HeBySQSIl5k_17 THROW THROW THROW THROW THIS ARE THREE BALL CASCADE PAT
HeBySQSIl5k_18 SO THE FIRST TRICK TO ONE OVER
HeBySQSIl5k_19 IS OVER THE TOP
HeBySQSIl5k_20 LIKE THIS TAKING ONE THROW FROM THE OUTSIDE OF GOING OVER
HeBySQSIl5k_21 BRING THAT WITH BOTH HANDS
HeBySQSIl5k_22 GOING WHAT'S CALLED JUGGLER'S TENNIS

HeBySQSIl5k_25 FOR EVERY BALL IS CROSSING OVER THE BALL IN FRONT OF
HeBySQSIl5k_26 WE ALSO LET OVER MILL'S MESS
HeBySQSIl5k_27 WHICH IS WHAT MOST FAMOUS JUGGLING TRICKS AND ONE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE TRY TO LEARN EARLY
HeBySQSIl5k_28 WHICH LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
HeBySQSIl5k_29 NEXT WE'LL BE MOVING ON TO SOME MORE ADVANCE BALL TRICKS
GyadXiKJfLU_1 OKAY NOW THIS METHOD OF DOING A KNOT IN OREGON AND THE VERSES TAKE OUR SCHOOLING TOOL HIM GET IT WET FROM THIS GUY OR AT THE CENTER REAGANOMICS CAN AGO
GyadXiKJfLU_2 ONE MAKE SURE IT'S NICE AND TO BE BECAUSE THIS LEADED HAS ALREADY REACH THE LEATHER HARD STAGE
GyadXiKJfLU_3 BUT WE'RE GOING TO THROW A FRESH CLEAN OUT ONTO IT
GyadXiKJfLU_4 I JUST PINCH A SMALL NOT CLAY OFF OF MY CLAY AND ROLLED INTO A BALL AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE TO MAKE THE KNOT
GyadXiKJfLU_5 SO THAT'S WHY WE LEFT A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA THICKNESS HERE ON THIS LID
GyadXiKJfLU_6 BECAUSE WE'RE THROWING DIRECTLY DOWN ON TO IT
GyadXiKJfLU_7 YOUR ENEMY PUTTING SOME PRESSURE ON THE EAR
GyadXiKJfLU_8 YOU HAVE TO SCORE IT UP AND GET IT FREEWAY
GyadXiKJfLU_9 AND IF IT'S TOO THIN YEARS AND PUSH STRAIGHT THROUGH THERE AND THAT'S NOT WHICH ONE
GyadXiKJfLU_10 THEY ALSO AND SCORE YOUR CLAVE ALL REALLY WELL
GyadXiKJfLU_11 THIS CONNECTION ON NEEDS TO BE VERY SECURE
GyadXiKJfLU_12 THIN IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO DRY

gxk4ThdlwB0_1 WE'RE IN AND SHOW YOU HOW TO HAVE YOUR DOG WE OUT RATHER THAN COME TO YOU
gxk4ThdlwB0_2 SOMETIMES WHEN YOU HAVE A DOG ESPECIALLY A NEW ONE IN YOUR FAMILY HE MADE ASSOCIATE HAT COMING TO YOU AS SOMETHING BAD HAPPENING TO ON AND WHO HAS A NEWS THAT WHEN THEY'RE MATTER DOG RATHER TRYING TO PUNISH THEM
gxk4ThdlwB0_3 SO WHAT WE MAY HAVE TO DO TO START THAT IS TEACH DOG JUST SIT IN WAIT UNTIL YOU GET TO THEM
gxk4ThdlwB0_4 SO IT'S BEEN START WITH YOUR BASIC SET <UNK> AND THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR DOG WILL LEARN TO SIT AT A DISTANCE SO THIS IS THE AFTER YOU'VE PRACTICED THAT
gxk4ThdlwB0_5 FIRST THING THAT YOU CAN TEACH THE DOG CAN IS YOUR SET
gxk4ThdlwB0_6 YOU DO YOUR DISTANCE SET SO THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE FURTHER AWAY SIT THE DOG WILL STAY AND SIT WHEREVER HE IS
gxk4ThdlwB0_7 THEN YOU CAN COME TO THE DOG AND SAFELY GET THE DOG AND REWARD HIM
gxk4ThdlwB0_8 AND THAT TRICK TO THIS WOULD BE TO LETTING GO OFF AND PLAY AGAIN AFTERWARDS
gxk4ThdlwB0_9 IF YOUR OLLIES HOOKING I'M NOT TAKE HIM OFF TO OF LEAVE FOR THE DAY YOU'RE SIMPLY TEACHING A DOG THAT IS NOT WORK THAT COME TO YOU ARE TO WAIT FOR YOU

GgI-2wEMSE8_2 WE'RE GOING TO USE AT LEAST I LIKE TO USE A VARIETY OF PAPERS VIBE TO START OUT ONE OF THE EASIEST TO ON VEST WAYS TO WORK IS ON A FAVOR THAT HAS A GRID ALREADY
GgI-2wEMSE8_3 BECAUSE WE'VE IT BUT THE LETTERS IN BETWEEN GUIDELINES THAT GRADED ALREADY ESTABLISHES FAIRLOW LINES SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THE MARKS WITHOUT HAVING TO MEASURE
GgI-2wEMSE8_4 NOW FOR ME THAT'S A BIG LAST AND I HOPE THAT OF THE OF A PLUS FOR YOU
GgI-2wEMSE8_5 I THINK GRID PAPER ENABLES YOU TO SET UP YOUR SHEET FOR WRITING IN A WAY THAT'S VERY QUICK AND EFFICIENT AND FOR THAT REASON AND TO GET PRACTICE MORE
GgI-2wEMSE8_6 SO I RECOMMEND THAT THING THE GRID PAPER ALTHOUGH YOU CAN EASE PLAIN PAPER IT HOME
GgI-2wEMSE8_7 PLAIN PAPER NECESSITATES MEASUREMENT SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE HITTING YOUR LETTERS INTEGRATED WHICH WILL DISCUSS SHORTLY YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MARK BOTH SIDES OF THE PAGE AND THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT BECAUSE THE ZONE LINE OUT
GgI-2wEMSE8_8 IT JUST TO GIVE IT GIVE YOU THE IDEA AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO CONNECT THE DOTS RIDGE DOING IN A SORT OF HAPHAZARD FASHION AND ESTABLISH GRID

hbXO3sxEvFQ_7 GET ALSO A FLASH WATER FUSING LINE <UNK> THAT WRAP A TOWEL OR A NITZE DON'T BURN YOURSELF ON THAT SEAM CAN ZAP <UNK> ON
hbXO3sxEvFQ_8 THE WATER TEMPERATURE IS ANOTHER SUPER IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT GIVES IT INTO BREWING ESPRESSO
hbXO3sxEvFQ_9 NON THE TEMPERATURE THAT YOU IT'S PREFERABLE TO KEEP YOUR WATER AT IS TO WRITE IT TWO HUNDRED DEGREES ON
hbXO3sxEvFQ_10 THE WAY THAT I'LL TEST THAT RIGHT NOW IS BY TURNING ON THE GROUP HEAD IN LONDON WATER FLOW TO HEAR A THERMOMETER
hbXO3sxEvFQ_11 GOOD AND WANT A THERMOMETER IT GOES UP TO TWO HUNDRED AT LEAST ON TO A TWENTY DEGREES THERE ARE SO ON

GLSEPbGzL5U_6 WE HAVE TWO PIECES OF BROWN PAPER

GC3uGpmvBS0_1 HI THIS IS YOLANDA VANDERVEEN FROM VANDERVEEN BALL
GC3uGpmvBS0_2 AND NEXT AND TALK ABOUT HOW TO GROW CACTUS
GC3uGpmvBS0_3 CACTUS OR CACTI IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE PLANT GROW NATURALLY AND IT DOESN'T
GC3uGpmvBS0_4 THEY'RE FOUND ALL OVER THE PLANET BUT USUALLY IN AREAS WITH VERY LITTLE RAINFALL
GC3uGpmvBS0_5 WHAT YOU LIVE IN THE NORTHWEST LIKE AUDIO
GC3uGpmvBS0_6 WE CAN SOME ROLL THEM WITHOUT LIVING IN THAT DOES IT
GC3uGpmvBS0_7 THEY DO REALLY WELL AND OUR ARM AS LAUGH
GC3uGpmvBS0_8 THE TREATMENT CACTI IS THE MAJOR TO ONLY PUT THEM OUTSIDE OVER THE SUMMER
GC3uGpmvBS0_9 IF YOU LIVE IN A COOL CLIMATE
GC3uGpmvBS0_10 AND MAKE SURE AND RUM INSIDE IN THE WINTER
GC3uGpmvBS0_11 IF YOU GET ALONE EIGHTY FIFTY DEGREES THAT NIGHTS
GC3uGpmvBS0_12 BECAUSE THEY REALLY DON'T WANT A FREE
GC3uGpmvBS0_13 IF THE AVI FREEZE YOU WILL LOSE THEM
GC3uGpmvBS0_14 SO THEY'RE VERY EASY TO GROW
GC3uGpmvBS0_15 IT IS THAT AMOUNT ON MY DAD
GC3uGpmvBS0_16 AND THEY'VE ABOVE THE HOT FIRM AND THEY LIKE TO DRY OUT IN THE TWENTY
GC3uGpmvBS0_17 IN SO WHENEVER AND IN I GET BELOW FIFTY IVORY HIM BACK INSIDE
GC3uGpmvBS0_18 AND THE THING TO DO REALLY WELL THAT WAY
GC3uGpmvBS0_19 SO THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU CAN RUN ON
GC3uGpmvBS0_20 THE KEY WITH CACTUS IS NOT ONE ARM TOO MUCH
GC3uGpmvBS0_21 AND THIS IS JUST MINE IN A LITTLE BOWL
GC3uGpmvBS0_22 AND IT SEEMS TO REALLY LIKE IT
GC3uGpmvBS0_23 IT GETS LOSS OF MOISTURE THAT STAYS IN THERE
GC3uGpmvBS0_24 AND IT LOOKS MEAT THERE TOO
GC3uGpmvBS0_25 SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT CREATIVE WAYS THAT YOU CAN GROWING
GC3uGpmvBS0_26 AND I'M WATER THIS MAYBE ONCE A MONTH
GC3uGpmvBS0_27 VERY VERY LITTLE DRY WATER IT
GC3uGpmvBS0_28 THIS SMALL CACTUS I REALLY LIKE
GC3uGpmvBS0_29 IT'S A CUNDY FOR YOUR WHICH ISN'T CONSIDERED A TRUE CACTUS
GC3uGpmvBS0_30 BUT IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL AND I'M JUST KEEP GROWING IN GROWING
GC3uGpmvBS0_31 AND I STARTED WITH A LITTLE ONE LIKE THIS ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO
GC3uGpmvBS0_32 AND THE LITTLE ONE NOW HAS TO BE TRANSPLANTED
GC3uGpmvBS0_33 BECAUSE IT'S GOT LIST
GC3uGpmvBS0_34 I JUST LOVE
GC3uGpmvBS0_35 IT'S A SLONE INGROWN IN WILD
GC3uGpmvBS0_36 AND AS YOU CAN SEE I'M USING GLOVES WHEN I PLAY WITH THEM
GC3uGpmvBS0_37 BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY SHARP
GC3uGpmvBS0_38 AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW HARD IT IS TO GET THE LITTLE CACTUS LITTLE TRICKS BACK OUT OF YOUR SKIN
GC3uGpmvBS0_39 BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HARD
GC3uGpmvBS0_40 AND THEY COME IN ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES
GC3uGpmvBS0_41 IN THIS PARTICULAR CACTUS I LIKE TO
GC3uGpmvBS0_42 IT'S A VERY SHARP
GC3uGpmvBS0_43 TO GET A V SO CAREFUL
GC3uGpmvBS0_44 AND I OVER WATERED IT SO THE MOTHER PLANT ACTUALLY STARTED DYING ON ME
GC3uGpmvBS0_45 IT IS TIME TO MUCH
GC3uGpmvBS0_46 SO I JUST THROW OFF THE TOP PARTS OF THE CACTUS
GC3uGpmvBS0_47 IT STILL LOOK GOOD
GC3uGpmvBS0_48 AND PUT IT BACK DOWN IN THE DIRT
GC3uGpmvBS0_49 AND THEN ANOTHER LIVING
GC3uGpmvBS0_50 EVEN WHEN YOU THINK HE KILL THEM
GC3uGpmvBS0_51 HALF THE TIME YOU CAN STILL TAKE PARTS THAT ARE STILL LIFE
GC3uGpmvBS0_52 AND PUT IT BACK DOWN TO DINNER
GC3uGpmvBS0_53 AND THE ROLL AGAIN
GC3uGpmvBS0_54 HALF ISLANDS THEM EACH
GC3uGpmvBS0_55 SO I FOUND TO KNOW IF THEY GET SHOULD BIGGER THEY START FALLING OVER
GC3uGpmvBS0_56 YOU CAN GIVE THEM A LITTLE BIT OF A HAIRCUT TOO
GC3uGpmvBS0_57 AND THESE ARE SOME SHARPIE THAT IT IS SO CAREFUL
GC3uGpmvBS0_58 BUT LIKE ON THIS ONE YOU BREAK IT
GC3uGpmvBS0_59 IT ACTUALLY MAKES KIND OF A
GC3uGpmvBS0_60 IT GETS REALLY VIEWING LIKE I'M OR GLUE
GC3uGpmvBS0_61 SO THE ROTATOR THAT YOU HAVE A CACTUS IS WATER IN TOO MUCH
GC3uGpmvBS0_62 SO WHEN IN DOUBT DON'T WATER
GC3uGpmvBS0_63 AS THE MY RULE OF THUMB
GC3uGpmvBS0_64 AND I ONLY WIDER THAN MAYBE ONCE A MONTH IT BACK
GC3uGpmvBS0_65 AND IN THE WINTERTIME EIGHTY ONLY ONCE EVERY TWO MONTHS
GC3uGpmvBS0_66 IN THAT HANDLE AGAIN I'M OR PUT MY FINGER INTO THE DIRT
GC3uGpmvBS0_67 IN YOU CAN TURN IS THE IF THEY'RE WET ENOUGH OR NOT
GC3uGpmvBS0_68 YOU DON'T WANT HIM TO THE REALLY WET
GC3uGpmvBS0_69 THE ONE TO THE OF OF THEM DRY FIVE
GC3uGpmvBS0_70 THAT THEY'LL DO REALLY WELL
GC3uGpmvBS0_71 HANDS EVEN IF THEY DO DIE AND TRY NOT TO TAKE IT PERSONALLY
GC3uGpmvBS0_72 AS YOU CAN ALWAYS GET A NEW STAR OFF OF ANOTHER ONE
GC3uGpmvBS0_73 AND THEY'RE SO EASY TO GROW

GIdUQK1Br54_10 AND YOU HAVE WITH AT THE SHOULDER AGAIN BOUNCING PROPORTIONS DRAWING THE EYE UP RIGHT ONE OF THE THINGS
GIdUQK1Br54_11 I THINK IS REALLY MARVELOUS THESE DAYS IS THAT THERE IS A LOT MORE VARIETY FOR PLUS SIZE WOMEN AS FAR AS DRESSING
GIdUQK1Br54_12 EVEN WORSE CONCERNED SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS VERY VERY EASY TO DO FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT FIGURE TIGHTS AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIZES IN ADDITION COMPANIES THESE DAYS ARE A LOT MORE CONSIDERATE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS VERY
GIdUQK1Br54_13 THOUGHTFUL OF THEM IS THEY GENERALLY FOR FIGHT FLUSH ALL SO CHARMAIN HITS
GIdUQK1Br54_14 ANYWHERE THIS AS ASTROLOGY
GIdUQK1Br54_15 EVEN IF IF SHE NEEDED TO COVER UP A LITTLE BIT MORE OFF FULL OR FOR IT DOWN AND THAT IS ACTUALLY STRAP

hF5zFRAgI5A_1 SOLUTION ONE MORE OKAY
hF5zFRAgI5A_2 <UNK> FOR THIS ONE HAS A PLACE FOR BEHIND IT DOES IS THAT OTHER COFFEE VITALLY
hF5zFRAgI5A_3 AND HERE'S ANOTHER DOES THE COLOR COFFEE
hF5zFRAgI5A_4 THIS IS THIS IS A CHART THAT I DID FOR MY AUNT CONNY ON WHEN SHE TURNED E
hF5zFRAgI5A_5 THIS IS A PICTURE OF HER AND HER WEDDING
hF5zFRAgI5A_6 AND THEN I JUST DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO DO THIS BECAUSE THEN YOU WOULD PLEASE MY FATHER AND MY FATHER WAS IN IS EIGHTIES BY THAT TIME AND I WANTED TO PLEASE AM AND SOAK
hF5zFRAgI5A_7 THIS IS HIS BROTHER AND SO I WENT AHEAD AND IN TWO MONTHS TIME I MANAGED TO GATHER ALL OF THIS INFORMATION AND COME UP WITH THIS CHART BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT USUALLY HOW IT WORKS
hF5zFRAgI5A_8 I DIDN'T DO A CHART ONE TIME WAS SEVEN HUNDRED NAMES ON AND INTO THE ENTIRE SUMMER AND OF COURSE I WASN'T GATHERING THE INFORMATION
hF5zFRAgI5A_9 BUT YOU'LL NOTICE ONE THING I MIGHT COUSIN BETTY IS A BIRDWATCHER SO I WANT A PAINTING WITH BIRDS ALL AROUND AND BECAUSE THE HERITAGE ON BOTH SIDES WAS OF FROM ITALIAN FROM ITALY AND PUT A MAP OF ITALY ON THERE
hF5zFRAgI5A_10 BUT YOU KNOW ALL START OUT WITH THE BASIC FORMAT AND THEN I ADDED SOME GOLD AND LOTS OF DECORATION AND NOT WITH AND I ALSO LEFT A LOT OF ROOM DOWN HERE FOR FOR ADDING NAMES
hF5zFRAgI5A_11 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEST THING OF ALL IT IS THAT ONCE YOU HAD ONCE I HAVE THE ORIGINAL DONE THAT I HAD COPIES MADE THAT WERE SMALL ENOUGH SO THAT BUILDS COPIES COULD THEN BE PUT ON A PLAIN OLD KODAK COPIER MACHINE SO THAT EVERYONE WHO CAME TO THIS CELEBRATION THIS EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION GOTS TAKE AWAY A COPY OF THE CHART
hF5zFRAgI5A_12 SO THE CHART WAS A SURPRISE IT WAS IN A FRAME BUT EVERYBODY GETS TO A QUICK OUT
hF5zFRAgI5A_13 SO ON IF THERE'S OTHER OF AND WAYS THAT YOU CAN FLAY WITH THE IDEA OF GENEALOGY CHARTS AND THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THEM WHERE IT WAS HIRED TO DO UP HERE THE GRANDFATHER TURNING SEVENTY AND THE IDEA WAS TO MAKE A TREE AND THEN TO PUT ALL THE GRANDCHILDREN'S NAMES ON THE TREE
hF5zFRAgI5A_14 ANOTHER ANOTHER SWEET JOB FOR ME TO DO NAMES AS I LOVE TO DO NAMES
hF5zFRAgI5A_15 THAT GENEALOGY CHARTS OF OUR AN IDEA
gHvH9lKbkiY_1 THIS IS EILEEN DEY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE AND IN THIS SEGMENT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE IDEA OF IN
gHvH9lKbkiY_2 SO IT'S AN BOLICK OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF TAOISM
gHvH9lKbkiY_3 IT'S REPRESENTED BY TO HOUSE OF THE HOLE
gHvH9lKbkiY_4 THE DARK IS THE FOUND IN THE LIGHT IS THE MASCULINE
gHvH9lKbkiY_5 THE DARK IS RECEPTIVE OF LIGHTING IS IF OUTPUT
gHvH9lKbkiY_6 EACH PIECE HAS MASCULINE AND FEMININE INDENTED WITH IN IT
gHvH9lKbkiY_7 EACH PIECE REPRESENTS A POLARITY OF OUR EXISTENCE AND YELL TAOISM ALSO UNDERSTANDS AT THE LINE BETWEEN THAT TO THE LINE WHERE THE MALE AND FEMALE HE IS A PLACE OF TRANSCENDENCE
gHvH9lKbkiY_8 IN THE MIDDLE SO TO SPEAK ON THERE ARE NO DIFFERENCE IS THERE ARE NO BARRIERS THERE IS THE HOLE
gHvH9lKbkiY_9 IN THIS NEXT SEGMENT WE'LL TALK ABOUT AN INTRODUCTION TO CONFUCIUS

hgq5Ft1qOu8_1 DURING THIS AS AN WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE BODY THAT WE'VE JUST SEPARATE IN THE BODY THAT WE JUST SEPARATED AND MOUNTED ON THE LADY
hgq5Ft1qOu8_2 ONE FOR THINGS TO DO IS GET A BLOCK OF WOOD MOUNTED IN TO THE LADIES
hgq5Ft1qOu8_3 YOU WANT TO BRING THIS BLACK TO ROUND AND CUT TWO SHOULDERS ON IT
hgq5Ft1qOu8_4 THE SMALLER SHOULDERS TO BE EIGHT A ONE AND ONE SIXTEENTH OF AN INCH TO FIT INTO THE BOARD HOLE AND THE SECOND ONE JUST LIGHTLY THE SMALLER THE ONE FIVE EIGHTHS OF AN INCH JUST TO GIVE YOURSELF SOME CLEARANCE
hgq5Ft1qOu8_5 WE PUT THE TWO TOGETHER YOU SHOULD BE ALMOST BE ABLE TO THE HAND THE PIECE STATES IT BY ITSELF ON THE ONE AND ONE SIXTEEN SINCE WILL BRING UP THE TAIL STOCK WITH A COLUMN CENTER AND THAT'LL ADISQ WHERE THINGS ALL
hgq5Ft1qOu8_6 AND ALSO DO AT THIS POINT IS BECAUSE IT GETS ALL MARKS ANOTHER MARKS FROM A PARTING TOOL ALL SQUARE UP THIS THE TOP END OF THE BODY
hgq5Ft1qOu8_7 IF ONE OF THE CHECK YOU WANT TO DO WITH THIS IS LAY YOUR TOOL AGAINST THE SLAT AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE BODY IS TO USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS

hgq5Ft1qOu8_10 THAT WAY WHEN YOU PUT THE TOP LINE YOU GIVE A NICE TIGHT EVEN FOR
H9VekekALAc_1 HI I'M AMELIA AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THE LAWS OF HAIR COLOR
H9VekekALAc_2 HOT ONLY COLOR DOES EXACTLY THAT
H9VekekALAc_3 IT ONLY DEPOSITS COLOR ON HAIR SHAFT
H9VekekALAc_4 IN OTHER WORDS IT WILL LAY A COAT OF COLOR JUST ON HERE SHOT
H9VekekALAc_5 SO IT'S REALLY KIND OF A STAIN
H9VekekALAc_6 THESE ARE EITHER GLAZES ENTER TONERS
H9VekekALAc_7 THESE ARE GREAT FOR IF YOU'VE GOT SOME BLONDE HIGHLIGHTS AND OR JUST WANTING TO TONE AND DOWN AND GOTTEN TO LIGHT OVER THE SUMMER
H9VekekALAc_8 YOU COULD GO IN WITH A DEPOSIT ONLY AND JUST APPLY IT
H9VekekALAc_9 AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT TURNING STRANGE COLORS TURNING GREEN OF PURPLE OR PINK UNLESS YOU GO OVER POROUS ENDS
H9VekekALAc_10 SO IN A WITH DEPOSIT ONLY HE CAN HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH THEM
H9VekekALAc_11 THEY'RE GREAT FOR TRYING ON COLOR
H9VekekALAc_12 IT'S A ONE OF THE REDHEAD FIRM A FEW MONTHS YOU CAN DEPOSIT ONLY OR COLOR AND JUST USE A DEPOSIT ONLY RED AND WILL FADE OFF
H9VekekALAc_13 YOU DON'T GET THAT LINE OF DEMARCATION JUST LIKE A SEMIPERMANENT
H9VekekALAc_14 HOWEVER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN DEPOSIT ONLY AND SEMIPERMANENT IS THAT SEMIPERMANENT MAY BLEND GRAY WHEREAS THE DEPOSIT ONLY IS NOT REALLY HUMAN DEPEND ON BLEND WE'RE AT
H9VekekALAc_15 AMA DEPOSIT ONLY IT WILL ALSO WORK WELL AS FAR AS MAINTAINING A COLOR
H9VekekALAc_16 SO LET'S SAY YOU USE PERMANENT COLOR ENDS YOU WANT TO ON KICK UP THE INTENSITY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WITH REDHEADS OR IF YOU'RE WANTING TENDS TO PULL GOLD OR WARM WITHOUT BRASSY COLLAR THAT A LOT OF WOMEN SAY THEN YOU CAN GO TO THE STORE AND YOU CAN GET SOME OF THE DEPOSIT ONLY GLAZES ON AND JUST APPLY THOSE
H9VekekALAc_17 USUALLY THEY'RE SHAMPOOED IN AN IT TAKES THE FIFTEEN MINUTES TO APPLY LAST TWO OR THREE SHAMPOOS AND THEY'RE GREAT GREAT FOR TONING GREAT FOR GLAZING IN GREAT FOR AND SHINE HERE HERE
GhHSnucJRrs_2 THE NEXT FUN STEP IS TO BE IT MAKE THE CENTER SHAFT FOR LAMP
GhHSnucJRrs_3 WE'VE ALREADY GLUED UP THE PIECES FOR THE BASIN WHILE THEY'RE DRYING WE'RE GONNA CUT THE LONGER TO MAKE THE TALKIES THAT GOES IN THE MIDDLE
GhHSnucJRrs_4 I FOUND A COUPLE OF PIECES HERE UNDER LIKE AND THEY HAVE GREAT WHETHER IN ON ROUNDER REALLY APPEALING LOOKING
GhHSnucJRrs_5 SOMEBODY IS THESE FOUR AND THE LAMP THAT WERE MAKING TODAY
GhHSnucJRrs_6 FIRST THING I'M ON A DAY IS SQUARE OFF THE EDGES
GhHSnucJRrs_7 SO IT HAS BEEN TAKEN BOTH AND LAY THEM DOWN HERE ON THE TABLE SAW AND PUSH AND I CLOSE UP NEXT TO THE FENCE
GhHSnucJRrs_8 A LOT NICER THESE ARE PUSHED FIRMLY AGAINST THE FENCE
GhHSnucJRrs_9 REMEMBER THIS WOOD IS NOT STRAIGHT SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S A STRAIGHT AS POSSIBLE WHEN YOU DO THIS CUT
GhHSnucJRrs_10 AND WHILE HOLDING FIRMLY DOWN AND TURN THE EDGE
GhHSnucJRrs_11 AND I'M STILL HOLDING BOTH PIECES TOGETHER WITH SELECTED ARE LANKFORD THIS PIECE TO BE EIGHTEEN INCHES
GhHSnucJRrs_12 AND I'VE ALREADY SET THE SAW UP WITH THE STOP DOWN HERE THAT'S EIGHTEEN INCHES FROM THE SIDE OF THE BLADE
GhHSnucJRrs_13 A PUSH THE PIECES UP IN I'M SQUARE AGAINST THE FENCE IS I CAN
GhHSnucJRrs_14 AND CUT INTO LENGTH
GhHSnucJRrs_15 HE AND CUT TO VISIT A PROPER LAMP
GhHSnucJRrs_16 NOW WITH THESE ARE TWO OTHER PIECES THAT I'VE ALREADY CUT IT TO MAKE THE CENTER PART OF THE SHAFT
GhHSnucJRrs_17 AND THEN IN A GOING HERE PRETTY MUCH LIKE THIS
GhHSnucJRrs_18 ENOUGH OF IN A NAIL IS FUSE ON TOP
GhHSnucJRrs_19 SO BEFORE YOU CUT THE THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS ON ONE OR GO OVER ABOUT CUTTING A SLIT ON A TABLE SAW
GhHSnucJRrs_20 AND I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THAT IN
GAbc4MyyZyo_1 I'D IS ROBERT STEWART WITH <UNK> THIRTEEN DOT COM
GAbc4MyyZyo_2 NOW WHEN IT COMES TO MAINTENANCE THE VERY FIRST STEP IS USUALLY THE STEP AND THAT IS THE BARREL
GAbc4MyyZyo_3 DEPENDING ON THE MAKE AND MODEL MOST BARRELS TODAY ARE THREADED BOMB BUT SOME BARRELS MAY ALSO BE ENCLOSED IN SOME SORT OF SHROUDING
GAbc4MyyZyo_4 OTHER BARRELS REQUIRE WILL THE DIFFERENT TEAR DOWN SUCH AS THE FLAT LINE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT MOUNTED IN EXACTLY THE SAME FASHION

hhjISQhs4NY_3 HOT SCISSOR BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL SHADE PLANT BECAUSE THEY'LL GROW SO EASILY IN THE SHADE
hhjISQhs4NY_4 MY TRICK IS THEY CAN INTIMATE SHADY THERE'S THOUGH IF YOU HAVE AN AREA WHERE WEEDS WHILE ROLLING EASILY MOSSER PINE NEEDLES ON HIM AND RIGHT ACROSS THE
hhjISQhs4NY_5 BUT IN THE ADD ANY KIND OF A SHADY AREA WE'RE WEEDS ARE COMING UP OR BALDER COMING UP OR YOU HAVE ANY OTHER FERNS GROWING IN HOSTAS WILL GROW REALLY WELL THERE AND THEY'RE JUST EASY TO GROW
hhjISQhs4NY_6 THEY'RE JUST A ROOT WITH A LOT OF LEAVES AND THEY MULTIPLY QUICKLY SO HOSTAS ARE REALLY EASY TO GROW
hhjISQhs4NY_7 BASICALLY BECOMES THE ROOTS WITH PART OF A STEM AND WE NEED TO BUY THEM OUT IT'S ALL YOU NEED IS WHAT THE REED WITH THE STEM IS AGES PLANTS IT ABOUT SEND ABOUT THREE INCHES DEEP SO THE STEMS BARELY OUT OF THE GROUND

G6_EhinHPow_2 AMOUNTS OF OFF MY FIST EXPERIENCE MAKING MATZAH BALLS CAT OUT MORE LIKE LOCKS THE NOSE NICE FLUFFY POSSIBLE TO FIND THE DELICATESSEN
G6_EhinHPow_3 THAT LESSON TRICKS OVER THE YEARS TO MAKE THE NICE FLUFFY ONCE OF MY ON THE CHIN IS TO INCORPORATE AIR INTO THE WET INGREDIENTS THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS USING A BLENDER AURA A REGULAR BLENDER OUR HAND BLENDER
G6_EhinHPow_4 LET'S DO IT THIS WITHIN A CRACK OR A STUNT INTO A SEPARATE CONTAINER AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY SHELLS LIKE THEM WILL <UNK>
G6_EhinHPow_5 PULL THE TO THE <UNK> AND THEN PUT THAT RIGHT INTO THE BLENDER <UNK> THAT'S FOR A IT'S FROM OUR CAN ADD A QUARTER CUP OF WATER ALL CALLED OUR QUARTER CUP OF OIL THE TRADITIONAL OIL TO USE WOULD BE SCHMALZ SCHMALZ THAT IS EIGHT RENDERED CHICKEN FAT IT'S NOT SO HEALTHY SO I LIKE TO USE A MIXTURE OF OLIVE OIL AND CANOLA OIL IS TWO TABLESPOONS OF OLIVE OIL AND TWO TABLESPOONS OF CANOLA OIL
G6_EhinHPow_6 I JUST ADDED A PINCH OF WHITE PEPPER AND TO TAKE TWO TEASPOONS TWO TEASPOONS OF SALTS NUMBER THE BLEND THAT UP UNTIL IT'S LIGHTING AND AIRY
gljUBiQSXec_1 I'VE DONE THAT YOU GO AND THESE ARE STYLE AND FASTER DARK WORLD DECK
gljUBiQSXec_2 I'LL TALK ABOUT ARTIFACTS
gljUBiQSXec_3 IS THAT NOLES KLAUS FEET ONE STUFF ON
gljUBiQSXec_4 AND THAT LETS YOU TAKE FIVE HOSACK OUT FROM THE AND REGULAR SHUFFLE MINTIER THAT AND DRAW TWO CARDS
gljUBiQSXec_5 THIS HEAVY ESPECIALLY TO LAY AGAIN WHEN YOU HAVE ALL YOUR DOG WILL MONSTERS IN THE GRAVEYARD AND KNOW THAT YOU WON'T BE DRAWING IN THE MORNING

hcqybw2ISH4_1 ALRIGHT SO WE WENT OVER SOME REALLY BASIC BASIC BASIC THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT ON A SAFETY BEFORE YOU START A PRACTICE STAGE TIMING
hcqybw2ISH4_2 NOW I'M GOING TO SAVE IN BETWEEN THE IN THIS CASE ALMOND BE THE ATTACKER IN SZALAY MY FIST IN HERE THESE CAN BE THE ATTACKEE NOAH SOME
hcqybw2ISH4_3 OF TWO BASIC THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE YOU JUST START TO DO ANY KIND OF LIKE PUNCHING OR SLAPPING MOVE OUR OWN ESTABLISHING DISTANCE AND ESTABLISHING EYE CONTACT BETWEEN THE PERSON YOU'RE ACTING WITH
hcqybw2ISH4_4 SO IF I WAS IN AGO AND I WANT A SLASH ON IN THE FACE WHICH WILL BE LEARNING IN JUST A SECOND AFTER REMOVING THAT'S IS ON ONE ESTABLISH A SAFE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE IN SHOWING
hcqybw2ISH4_5 SO WHAT WE WOULD DO IF YOU WERE IN THE COME UP LIKE A VASE CAN WALK UP THE SHINE AND THE LIFE PAY A LITTLE SLACK YOU IN THE FOR A SHOT
hcqybw2ISH4_6 I WOULD GO ALL NOW AND PUT MY HANDS ON INFIELDER'S JUST LIKE THAT TO ESTABLISH A SAFE DISTANCE
hcqybw2ISH4_7 THAT WAY IF I'M NOT TOO CLOSE OR NOT TOO FAR AWAY SO THAT IT DOESN'T LOOK REAL
hcqybw2ISH4_8 THE NEXT THING YOU'RE GOING TO DO AFTER YOU'VE ESTABLISHED THE SAME DISTANCE EVEN A MAKE EYE CONTACT
hcqybw2ISH4_9 THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THE KEY IN BETWEEN YOU AND THE OTHER ACTOR YOU'RE WORKING WITH
hcqybw2ISH4_10 IT'S THE CUE TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO AND AGAIN INVENTION WILL KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU'RE GOING TO DO
hcqybw2ISH4_11 NEVER DO THIS NOT ONLY IS CAN BE VERY ON SAFE AND SOMEONE'S IN IT FOR
hcqybw2ISH4_12 SO THE TWO BASIC THINGS TO KNOW THIS ADDITIVES INS AND THE CUE BETWEEN THE TWO ACTORS THAT WHICH YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE READY TO START ON THINGS LIKE THAT
gNmCeE_tT48_1 THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GAMES
gNmCeE_tT48_2 HANDS ONE GAME IS A VARIATION THE MOST POPULAR FORM OF THE GAME IS PLAYED TODAY IN WILL BECOME INTO THAT IN THE NEXT SESSION IS CALLED BID WHIST WITH KITTY
gNmCeE_tT48_3 IT WAS BETWEEN STRAIT WHIST IN BID WHIST IS THAT IN STRAIT WHIST THERE ARE NO JOKERS WE DO NOT USE JOKERS AND STRAIT WHIST
gNmCeE_tT48_4 NUMBER TWO WE DO NOT HAVE A KITTY
gNmCeE_tT48_5 A KEY RACING WOOD TO EUCHRE IS A LIKE A DISCARD PILE
gNmCeE_tT48_6 FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE DEALING OUT THE CALVES WHICH SAYS DEAL NOT REAL QUICK THEY WOULD BE A POINT IN TIME THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE FOUR CARDS IN THE KITTY PLUS THE JOKERS THAT'S A KITTY
gNmCeE_tT48_7 STRAIT WHIST WE DEAL OUT ALL THE CARDS
gNmCeE_tT48_8 EVERYBODY STARTS WITH THIRTEEN CARDS
gNmCeE_tT48_9 SO THAT IS THE BASIC DIFFERENCE
gNmCeE_tT48_10 OTHERWISE THE TERMS UP COUNTED DOWNTOWN WILL COME INTO THE PLAY
gNmCeE_tT48_11 FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GAMES STRAIT WHIST ALL CARDS ARE DEALT ALL CARDS ARE IN PLAY IN BID WHIST KITTY WHIST SIX CARDS INCLUDING THE JOB IS OR IN THE KITTY SO YOU HAVE A MUCH MORE LIVELY UNCOMPETITIVE AUCTION
GY_XmNhupPo_1 KNOWING <UNK> TIRES AND PRETTY USEFUL ON A TRICK CONTENT WHEN IT COMES TO UP THE MOUNTAIN BIKER EXAMINE CHANGING CARED FOR PREFERENCES THE FAMOUS CHANGING TIRES AND EVEN FLAT

GY_XmNhupPo_4 NOW I OPEN THE VALVE OF THE FOOT DOWN WITH OUR COMES UP SO A LITTLE THE AIR OUT IF
GY_XmNhupPo_5 IT'S A FIFTH OF AS A HEALTHY FLY ELF PUSH DOWN HALF OF THE THIGH IF <UNK> LEVEL OF THE QUICKER
GY_XmNhupPo_6 IF THIS EATING HERE SO COMING OUT WITH THAT WE'RE PRETTY GOOD
GB62hbudKcY_2 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HOIST ENDING

h8ZC9z944cU_4 IF YOU WANT A CUT THE BALL TO THE RIGHT IN YOUR RIDING A PITCHER YOU CUT THE BALL IN HALF AND POSITION BOTH FINGERS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF A BALL
h8ZC9z944cU_5 IF YOU WANTED TO CUT THE BALL TO THE LEFT AND A CUTTER FASTBALL YOU POSITION FINGERS ON TO THE LEFT HALF A BALL TO CREATE SPAN AND MOVEMENT THAT WOULD MAKE THE BALL BASICALLY CURVE TO THE RIGHT

GfHucOeFuzE_2 I'M MICHAEL SEE DON'T AND IN THIS CLIP GOING TO TALK ABOUT ALL THE PROPER SETTINGS TO USE ON A DIGITAL SLR FOR JEWELRY PHOTOGRAPHY
GfHucOeFuzE_3 SO WE'VE GOT HERE IN NYC CONTI TWO HUNDRED
GfHucOeFuzE_4 WHEN SHOOTING JEWELRY THIS NUMBER THINGS YOU NEED TO BE OUT THINKING ABOUT WITH YOUR CAMERA SETTINGS
GfHucOeFuzE_5 NUMBER ONE IS YOU FILM SPEED OR ISO
GfHucOeFuzE_6 YOU WANT TO BE AS LOW AS POSSIBLE IN THIS CASE I'M THE KNEES ISO ONE HUNDRED
GfHucOeFuzE_7 THAT GIVES YOU THE MOST DETAIL AND THE LEAST NOISE
GfHucOeFuzE_8 SINCE WE'RE SHOOTING A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT YOU CAN ADJUST THE LIGHT ON IT ALLOWS YOU TO GO TO A LOWER ISO
GfHucOeFuzE_9 THE SECOND THING YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS YOUR APERTURE
GfHucOeFuzE_10 THAT'S GOOD CONTROL HOW MUCH DEPTH OF FIELD OR HOW MUCH OF YOUR ON A PIECE OF JEWELRY IS IN FOCUS
GfHucOeFuzE_11 YOU WILL TEND TO WANT TO GO WITH A SMALLER APERTURE WHICH GIVES YOU MORE DEPTH OF FIELD ASA SOMETHING SAY THIRTEEN OR SIXTEEN ALL YOU MAY EVEN WANT LOOKED WORDS TWENTY TWO ALTHOUGH I DON'T LIKE GOING HIGH BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU GET SOME A AND THE LIGHT TO FACTS A LITTLE BIT AND MAKES THE PITCHER A LITTLE FUZZ HERE
GfHucOeFuzE_12 SO YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT DRIES SO YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT YOUR SHUTTER SPEED AS WELL YOU WANNA SHOULD MANUAL
GfHucOeFuzE_13 DON'T USE THE PROGRAM MODE
GfHucOeFuzE_14 SHOULD ON MANUAL AND YOU'LL HAVE TO A WORKOUT THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR WHAT YOUR ARM THE PROPER SHUTTER SPEED IS
GfHucOeFuzE_15 SO YOU GOT TO SHUTTER SPEED YOUR APERTURE YOU WANT IT HIGHER AUGHT YOUR FILM SPEED YOU WANT A LOWER AND THOSE ARE SOME KEY SETTINGS ON A DIGITAL SLR FOR JEWELRY PHOTOGRAPHY
hbtksI9ewLk_2 ANOTHER KICK DRILL THAT I DEVELOPED AT THE SAME TIME THAT I DEVELOPED A QUART RACKET DROVE WAS THE SIDE POCKET DRILL
hbtksI9ewLk_3 SAME SET UP PRETTY MUCH
hbtksI9ewLk_4 YOUR CUE BALL START IN THE SAME PLACE
hbtksI9ewLk_5 IT'S ALL WHAT'S CALLED THE OTHER FOOT SPOT OF THE TABLE
hbtksI9ewLk_6 IN OTHER WORDS A CENTER THE TABLE THIS WAY AND THE SECOND TIME AND UP
hbtksI9ewLk_7 YOUR OBJECT BALL STARTS RIGHT IN THE CENTER THE TABLE
hbtksI9ewLk_8 YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO KICK THE BALL IN EITHER ONE OF THESE TWO POCKETS FROM THAT SET
hbtksI9ewLk_9 THAT'S WHERE WE WANT A STAR
hbtksI9ewLk_10 SO WE'RE BACK TO IDENTIFYING OUR ANGLE INTO THE CUSHION AN OUT ONCE AGAIN TO HIT THIS BALL
hbtksI9ewLk_11 SO WE WOULD IDENTIFY THAT IS A SPOT RIGHT ABOUT THERE
hbtksI9ewLk_12 NINETY SEE WHAT HAPPENED
hbtksI9ewLk_13 IT WENT LONG
hbtksI9ewLk_14 I I HIT IT TOO THIN AND IT WOULD BE ON THE POCKET
hbtksI9ewLk_15 BUT THIS IS REALLY GOOD PRACTICE RIGHT HERE BECAUSE NOW WE'RE GOING TO KICK THE BALL
hbtksI9ewLk_16 AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE TRYING TO CONTROL THE SPEED TO COME BACK AND JUST GENTLY NURSE IT UP IN FROM THE POCKET SO THAT WE GET IT IN TO EASY SCORING POSITION SO THAT WE CAN GO BACK AND FORTH ONCE AGAIN
hbtksI9ewLk_17 SO WE'RE REALLY GETTING A LOT OF BENEFIT OUT OF THIS DRUM
hbtksI9ewLk_18 SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK
hbtksI9ewLk_19 NEXT ROW WOULD BE IF IF HER LIKE SUCH
hbtksI9ewLk_20 NOW IT'S IN PRETTY GOOD SCORE IN POSITION DEPENDING ON HOW WELL I CAN GET
hbtksI9ewLk_21 SO MY OBJECTIVE NOW'S COME OVER HERE WITH THE ANGLE THAT I NEED TO THEN KICK THE BALL INTO THIS CLOCK
hbtksI9ewLk_22 WITH THEN OF COURSE ON THIS
hbtksI9ewLk_23 I ADDED A STROKE
hbtksI9ewLk_24 BUT A KEY COUNTING STROKES UNTIL I POCKET IN EITHER ONE THESE POCKETS
hbtksI9ewLk_25 AND AGAIN ON ONE RIGHT DOWN THAT SCORE KEEP A LOG SO THAT I CAN ANIME ALL UP AND THEN TO AN AVERAGE
hbtksI9ewLk_26 AND DAY TO DAY ON MY AVERAGE TO COME DOWN TO THE VERY LOWS POINT
hbtksI9ewLk_27 THAT'S ONE I'LL KNOW THAT ON BECOMING A BETTER AT KICKING OF BALLS
GRkwQcHdRd4_1 HELLO
GRkwQcHdRd4_2 THIS IS MICHAEL PLUNKETT ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
GRkwQcHdRd4_3 WHEN ON AND TAKE A LOOK AT A NEW TERM FOR GUITAR IS CALLED FROM <UNK>
GRkwQcHdRd4_4 SO YOU CAN SEE IT MARCH ON A GUITAR TABLATURE SCORED LIKE THIS TRIM
GRkwQcHdRd4_6 BUT BASICALLY MEANS IS THAT WE WANT TO CREATE A SOUND FROM A GUITAR ON THAT MIGHT MAKE A VOICE OR VIOLIN
GRkwQcHdRd4_7 IT'S A SUSTAINING SOUND ONE THAT DOESN'T STOP WORTH ONLY PLUCK A GUITAR
GRkwQcHdRd4_8 IT'S A SHORTS ON THE DYES OFF
GRkwQcHdRd4_9 SO WE ACHIEVE THAT BY GETTING THIS KIND OF WILL ON FIRST IN THE FINGER PICKING STYLE IT WITH OUR FINGERS WHERE WE TAKE OUR RING MIDDLE INDEX AND REPEAT THEM ON A STRING
GRkwQcHdRd4_10 WE CAN ALTERNATE OUR THUMB AND THE FIFTH STRING IF WE WANTED IT WOULD COME OUT LIKE THIS
GRkwQcHdRd4_11 AND LOOSEN LOOSEN INTONATION LOOM WOULDN'T SEE CAN HEAR IT KIND OF BRINGS A MORE SUSTAINS SOUND
GRkwQcHdRd4_12 NOW WE CAN ALSO DO THIS ON AN ELECTRIC GUITAR OR ANY TYPE OF GUITAR WORRY BE USING A KICK
GRkwQcHdRd4_13 IN THIS CASE WE WE COULD BE PLAYING THE SAME STRINGS
GRkwQcHdRd4_14 BASICALLY IT'S JUST A MATTER OF MOVING THE KICK BACK AND FORTH VERY QUICKLY SO WE WOULD DO IT AND REALLY A WRIST MOTION THAT WE USE
GRkwQcHdRd4_15 AND AND THE CLOTH SO CAN BE DONE BOTH WAYS OF THE TERM TREMMEL MEANS A SHORT FAST REPEATING NOW TO CREATE THAT SUSTAINED SAM
GBb7UcYQizc_1 NOW ONCE OUT ABOUT IS INVOLVING INJURE LINKS CEO'S HIM INTO MAKING SURE IT
GBb7UcYQizc_2 AND BASICALLY WHAT I WANT TO THE FIRST ON DOING TRICKS IS THE KEY IS YOU HAVE TO BE LOOSE YOU HAVE TO BE VERY RELAXED AND YET AGAIN A TOES
GBb7UcYQizc_3 SHE CAN MAKE QUICK MOVING QUICK DECISIONS
GBb7UcYQizc_4 SO EVERYTHING I'VE TAUGHT USE IS A COMMON A USING COMBINATIONS TO MAKE TRICKS THAT YOU GET CUTS YOU GET THE ROLL OVER AND AND ALSO THAT IS THE BASIC TRICK OF OF THE STEP OVER
GBb7UcYQizc_5 WHICH IS FROM FROM LAZY WITH THAT IS IS THAT IT'S A FAKE DOES A FAKE TO ONE SIDE SO THEY THINK IT IN A GO THAT WAY WITH THE BALLS IS CAN KEEP GOING THE SAME WHEN YOU CAN DO WOULD'VE YOU WANT WITH HIM
gMJe2MJJP7E_1 EDGES OFF ON THE SAYS CANADA DEMONSTRATE THAT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT ON WEAPONS CONNECTOR WHEN IT'S A KNIFE A JOB LIKE OTHER FIVE FOOT STAFF WORSE A WORD OR FOODS AND TO AN ATTACK WITH INTO THE OF GRAB OR OF A STRIKE ON ANY TECHNIQUE THAT WE'VE GOT AN IDEAL CAN BE APPLIED TO FROM WHATEVER SITUATION
gMJe2MJJP7E_2 ON SO WE'RE AND GO BACK AND DO THE SAME TECHNIQUE BUT REAPPLY TO JUMP
gMJe2MJJP7E_3 LAST THAT WOULD IT'S OF MEN EVEN ON IT WITH THE KNIFE THAT LIFE IS THEM WE'RE IN A VIEW OF THOUGHT OF LIVE IT MORE BASIC ON JEWELRY OF OR JILTED WITH THE EDGES
gMJe2MJJP7E_4 SO AGAIN SO COMBINING OF
gMJe2MJJP7E_5 DANIELS'S CAN COME IN WITH THE SKI
gMJe2MJJP7E_6 AS HE DOES HAVE OBVIOUSLY NEED TO GET OFF LINE
gMJe2MJJP7E_7 AND ONCE YOU'VE GOT TO BE ONE START WITH MY HANDS FOR PART THEN PUT ONE IS A AND IF YOU NEED TO DO THIS AGAIN AND THEN ONE A SLIDE IN GIVE MY OTHER HAND IT'S OFF
gMJe2MJJP7E_8 FACE THE SAME DIRECTION BRING THIS OFF STUFF WITH MY ARM
gMJe2MJJP7E_9 IF IT'S IT'S OF BEING A SKIS ON THE SIDE ONE AND ENTER C FLAT AND GETTING IT AS DEEP AS I CAN GET THIS OVER THE SELF FRIZZ OF FLIPS THE <UNK>
gMJe2MJJP7E_10 IT'S REALLY THE HIPS TURNING VERY AND IF THAT
gMJe2MJJP7E_11 TRADITIONALLY WE WOULD AGAIN PLACE THAT ON THE GROUND AND THEN WALK THROUGH A WALK AWAY
gMJe2MJJP7E_12 IF YOU'VE SUPPORTS ASKED NICE AND CLEAN IT OFF
gMJe2MJJP7E_13 NEXT WOULD BE AN <UNK>
gMJe2MJJP7E_14 THE ONLY THE END
gMJe2MJJP7E_15 THEY'VE WE CUT IT IN WITH IT PUSH THE TANK AND CUT DOWN HALF THE <UNK>
gMJe2MJJP7E_16 SO AS HE COMES EMF HITS THE OUTSIDE VERY THAT FINGER THIS WITH SPOT AND TWIST LEAF LINES FACE AGAIN STRETCH
gMJe2MJJP7E_17 ARMS IF I'M IN A PETER REGULAR PUNCH TECHNIQUE WE LOOK VERY SIMILAR FLIES IN THESE IF AND THROUGH THERE
gMJe2MJJP7E_18 THE EXACT SAME TECHNIQUE YOU WITH THE SKI THIS IS A <UNK>
gMJe2MJJP7E_19 SAME THING WE'RE IN A GET HIGH OFFLINE FLUFF AND FLAT

H-BCSLY7XSo_1 HI I'M BETTY INGHAM AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE WE CAN REPLACE THE WHITE SIDING BECAUSE IT WAS JUST EXPENSIVE SO WE PATCHED IT
H-BCSLY7XSo_2 THERE'S CLABORN UNDERNEATH IT BUT IT WAS SO ROTTEN THAT THEY HAD ALREADY PUT THIS SIDING OF YEARS AGO WE PATCH DID WE EVEN PAINTED PART OF IT AT THE TOP
H-BCSLY7XSo_3 WHICH YOU CAN PAINT SIDING WEEDING REALIZE PINNING IT WIDE THAT PORCH WAS RESTORED THERE WAS A CONCRETE FOUR TO EIGHT THAT'S ALL THAT WAS THERE
H-BCSLY7XSo_4 WE UP A MADE THE WE GOT THE SPINDLES AND WE RESTORED THAT THE IDEAL WORE OUT IS THERE'S IS THE ORIGINAL DOOR AND WE PAINTED ALL OF THE LITTLE OR NATIVE FIXTURES THE COLORS THAT WERE VICTORIAN COVERS
H-BCSLY7XSo_5 AND THE UM FINIALS WE'RE ALL REPLACED TALL AND NOT VERY FAR APART BECAUSE IT CHILDREN FALLING OVER THE TOP AND GETTING THEIR HEADS IN BETWEEN
Go2INfZ8Mtk_1 SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE AN ADVANTAGE COLOR HAS COME A LONG WAY WITH AN GRAY COVERAGE
Go2INfZ8Mtk_2 THE WAY OF DEAD ADD GRAY COVERAGE USE TO WORK WITH THE BETA IS THAT YOU HAD SURE TENS OF IT WORKS WITH THEN YOU HAVE YOUR TENSIONER FINANCIAL SHADE
Go2INfZ8Mtk_3 AND I CAN GET TO TECHNICAL
Go2INfZ8Mtk_4 BASICALLY WHAT YOU HAVE SECURE TEN WHICH IS IN AND IT COVERS THE GRAY
Go2INfZ8Mtk_5 AND HE HAD OR WHY OF WHICH WAS COVERING OF WAR
Go2INfZ8Mtk_6 SO THAT IS WILLING MOVED INTO GRAY COVERAGE AND REALLY TAKING THAT MARKET AN OVER
Go2INfZ8Mtk_7 BECAUSE IT WAS IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE OF WAR
Go2INfZ8Mtk_8 AN WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT OF A THAT COVERAGE VERSUS LET'S SAY A CONSUMER I'M GOING TO STORE AND BUYING A EVOX COLOR IS YOU REALLY GET AT HER SLICE FORMULATION WHICH MEANS YOU
Go2INfZ8Mtk_9 WEEKEND MATCH IDENTICALLY ARE HERE WITH A FEW TIMES WHICH IS REALLY GREAT
Go2INfZ8Mtk_10 COLOR WISE IT'S HEALTHIER
Go2INfZ8Mtk_11 IT'S NINETY SEVEN PERCENT ACTUALLY DRIVE YOU'RE NOT HAVING ANY HAVE PETROCHEMICALS IN THAT IN THE HAIR COLOR ABSORBED ENSURES TOWEL AND
Go2INfZ8Mtk_12 ALSO WHAT'S REALLY GREAT IS THAT IF YOUR GRAY CHANGES BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT TENDS HAPPEN WITH AN CORE MEN'S ARE GREAT CHANGES A CAN START AT LIKE A GREAT ITEMS LIKE A SLIGHT RAIN MOVE INTO MORE OF A WHITE WERE YELLOW GRAY
Go2INfZ8Mtk_13 SO WITH THE OF A PICTURE TENS WE CAN USE ADD THE ACTUAL TONE LIKE LET'S SAY THAT MOVE INTO MORE GELLER GRAY WE WOULD USE A VIOLET TEND TO COUNTERACT THAT DON'T MAKE IT MORE THE NATURAL LOOKING AT COLOR
Go2INfZ8Mtk_14 THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY GREAT ABOUT THE BETA COLOR VERSES LET'S SAY A CONSUMER COLOR
Go2INfZ8Mtk_15 IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY IF YOU'RE GOING TO IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP GOING
Go2INfZ8Mtk_16 YOU WOULD GO TO A DENTIST TO DO THAT
Go2INfZ8Mtk_17 IT'S THE SAME THING WITH GRAY COVERAGE
Go2INfZ8Mtk_18 IN COLOR IF YOU'RE HAVING THAN HIDE IT PROFESSIONALLY THEN BECAUSE IT'S ONION IT'S THE BEST WAY TO GO
Go2INfZ8Mtk_19 AND WE ARE ALSO HALF AN VOLUME WISE AND ADD TWENTY VOLUME BASICALLY IT GETS IN THE CHEMISTRY MORE OF WHAT WE MIX WITH COLOR
Go2INfZ8Mtk_20 BUT AN WHAT THE TWENTY VOLUME DOES IS IT ALLOWS US TO OPEN THE CUTICLE UP TO THE FIRST FIFTEEN EXCUSE ME FOR THE FIRST FIFTEEN MINUTES TO DEPOSIT THE COLOR AND IT ALLOWS THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES AND FORWARD THE LIFT PROCESS
Go2INfZ8Mtk_21 SO IT'S A REALLY GREAT AN COMBINATION OF COLOR TO USE UP FOR CONSUMER VERSES PURSE IS GOING TO SWING GETTING IN A COUNTER

gFq-hog96so_2 ONLY E ON TWO SAFETY CONCERNS WE'RE CIRCUIT BENDING AND THE FIRST STARTING MENTION WHICH IS ON YOU NEVER NEVER NEVER WANT TO CIRCUIT BEND SOMETHING THAT PLUMS INTO THE WALL UNLESS YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT ELECTRONICS IN YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND YOU'LL VOLTAGE AND THE RISK SKIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SCENE D C AND YOU KNOW YOU KNOW ABOUT CAPACITORS IN WHAT WE CAN AND CAN'T DO
gFq-hog96so_3 SO ON YOU KNOW CIRCUIT BENDING THINGS THAT ARE BATTERY POWERED LOW VOLTAGE IS VERY VERY SAFE
gFq-hog96so_4 JUST DON'T EVER DO ANYTHING THAT PLUG INTO A WALL UNTIL YOU REALLY FEEL IT YOU KNOW A LOT OF OUR ELECTRONICS AND THAT YOU ARE CAN OF COMFORTABLE WITH GOING DOWN THE ROAD BUT I PERCENT WINDOW
gFq-hog96so_5 UM WHEN YOU ARE CIRCUIT BENDING SOME IT'S LOW VOLTAGE ON YOU WON'T GET A SHOCK UP ON A MAY NEED SOME THINGS THAT RUN OFF OF YOU KNOW A LOT OF BATTERIES AND MAYBE HAVE SOME BIG CAPACITORS AND AND YOU MIGHT GET A LITTLE TINGLE OR SOMETHING THAT I'VE NEVER BEEN SHOT OR ANYTHING IN IN IT COME IN THE SENSE BECAUSE AND THERE IT IS ONE OF SUCH LOW VOLTAGE OR JUST LITTLE LITTLE AA BATTERIES IN THEM AND SO
gFq-hog96so_6 AND MOST OF THEM DON'T HAVE IN A LARGE CAPACITORS IN THEM SO YOU KNOW YOU'RE REALLY NOT A GOOD SHOT
gFq-hog96so_7 I'M THE ONLY REAL REST THAT THERE ISN'T WORKING WITH A CIRCUIT BOARDS FROM ELECTRONICS WITH YOU IS YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT MAKE A VENDOR TRY SOMETHING OUT THEY MIGHT FRY A SOMETHING OF CIRCUIT BOARD WHEN HE MIGHT FRYING CAPACITOR OR IN A MIDI YOU KNOW IF YOU SEND LIKE A LOT OF THE ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE BOARD AND YOU KNOW TOO CLOSE TO THE POWER SOURCE FOR TOO CLOSE TO NEW CAPACITORS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
gFq-hog96so_8 SOMETIMES YOU CAN BAIT OF THAT CIRCUIT BOARD BUT YOU KNOW AT LEAST YOU CANNOT OF IT ONCE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT FOOT
gFq-hog96so_9 SO ON SO THAT WAS REALLY THE ONLY RISKS FROM ONE OF THE ELECTRICAL POINT OF VIEW UM WILL BASICALLY NINE IF YOU'RE STAYING WITH BATTERY POWERED DEVICES
gFq-hog96so_10 I'M IN THEN WERE NEXT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE RISKS FROM THE SOLDERING IRON WHICH IS KIND OF AN IMPORTANT THING TO THINK ABOUT

Gy_c1fVrBQ4_1 HI I'M TOM SWAN A ENROLLED AGENT AND IN THIS SECTION IS ABOUT CLUB DUES
Gy_c1fVrBQ4_2 WHETHER IT WAS MADE TO ELIMINATE CLUB TO USE IN BEING DEDUCTIBLE OF ALL I AM THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF BACKLASH TO THE HIGHER ASKED ABOUT THAT
Gy_c1fVrBQ4_3 SO THEY COME UP WITH THE AN INTERESTING CONCLUSION CLUB DUES ARE NOT DEDUCTIBLE BY DEFINITION FRIZZ SOCIAL ATHLETICS SPORTING HIGH AIRLINE IN HOTEL TIGHT CLUBS BUT PTA PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING KIWANIS EMBROIDERY IN THOSE ORGANIZATION
Gy_c1fVrBQ4_4 IF THE PRINCIPAL PURPOSE IS NOT FOR ENTERTAINMENT SO IT'S KIND OF AMBIGUOUS SITE I THINK THAT THE REAL DIRECTION HERE IT AND NOT ALLOW ALONG DEDUCTION FOR THINGS LIKE COUNTRY QUADS AND NOT CLUBS AND ALL THINGS THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY YOUR PURELY ENTERTAINER

GRjKa1aih8s_11 THIS IS FROM THE LOW
GRjKa1aih8s_12 <UNK> IS A TRIBAL INSTANT
GRjKa1aih8s_13 WHICH MEANS THE TRIBAL INSTANT WHICH MEANS IT COUNTS AS A GOBLIN SPILL
GRjKa1aih8s_14 THEY HAVE THESE FOR ELSE IS ON THESE GIFT INS THEY HAVEN'T FOR ALL CREATURE TYPES
GRjKa1aih8s_15 THE REASON THIS IS IS BECAUSE A LOT OF CREATURES SOUND IN THAT ANY TIME YOU OR AN OPPONENT PLAYS A SPELL OF A CERTAIN TYPE I.E
GRjKa1aih8s_16 GOBLIN MEANS GOBLIN CREATURE OR NOW GOBLIN INSTANT TRIBAL INSTANT THEN CERTAIN EFFECTS TO TAKE PLACE

HePfkV3d6X4_6 YOU CAN HARDLY HELP THROW ONE OF THESE IN THE AIR AND WITHOUT NATURALLY SPINNING SO WE ATTEMPTING TO DO THESE TRICKS ARE IN ATTEMPTING TO DO THAT KEEP THAT IN MIND
HePfkV3d6X4_7 YOU DON'T HAVE TO PHYSICALLY SPIN IT WHEN YOU THROW IT IT PRETTY MUCH AUTOMATICALLY DOESN'T
HePfkV3d6X4_8 AS FAR AS FLIGHT HATS EVERYTHING IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL THE THREE BALL JUGGLING TO GIVE THE ADDED COMPLEXITY OF THE CLUBS SPINNING ENOUGH TO BE PAY ATTENTION THAT UNIT CATCH THE RIGHT HAND OUT
HePfkV3d6X4_9 SOME TRICKS DO INCLUDE CATCHING THE WRONG AND WE'RE NOT TO TOUCH ANY OF THOSE SO HERE WE GO HOW TO JUGGLE THREE CLUBS

hAISKfe8_nM_2 THIS IS JON ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
hAISKfe8_nM_3 IN THIS VIDEO CLIP I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT CHOOSING DRYWALL
hAISKfe8_nM_4 THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT CHOICES WHEN YOU CHOOSE DRYWALL
hAISKfe8_nM_5 THE DRYWALL THAT I'VE CHOSEN FOR THIS PROJECT IS FIVE EIGHTHS OF AN INCH THICK
hAISKfe8_nM_6 THEY ALSO SELL HALF INCH THICK AND THREE EIGHTHS INCH THICK DRYWALL
hAISKfe8_nM_7 THE REASON I CHOSE THE THICKER DRY WALL IS BECAUSE IT IS FOR A GARAGE WALL SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A CHORD OR OPEN INTO THE DRYWALL
hAISKfe8_nM_8 WITH A THICKER DRYWALL IS LESS LIKELY TO PUT A HOLE THROUGH THE DRYWALL AND MORE LIKELY JUST TO PUT IN A DENT
hAISKfe8_nM_9 I'VE ALSO CHOSEN A FIRE RESISTANT DRY WALL
hAISKfe8_nM_10 WHEN IT COMES TO FIRE YOU ALL THE PROTECTION THAT YOU CAN HAVE
hAISKfe8_nM_11 IF YOU HAPPEN BE DRY WALL IN A BATHROOM YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO USE A MOLD AND MILDEW RESISTANT DRY WALL
hAISKfe8_nM_12 IN ADDITION THERE'S MANY OTHER TYPES OF DRY WALL FOR DIFFERENT AREAS THAT YOU DRY WALLING
hAISKfe8_nM_13 LASTLY I'VE CHOSEN AN EIGHT FOOT SHEET OF DRY WALL BECAUSE MY WALLS ARE UNDER EIGHT FEET TALL
hAISKfe8_nM_14 IT WOULD BE VERY SMART TO BUY A TWELVE FOOT SECTION AND JUST HAVE TO CUT OFF FOUR FEET OF IT

g6Nk9SdgLWc_1 YOU KNOW AS IMPORTANT BEEF INCISION GETTER REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE OPTIONS YOU HAVE TO USE USE ONE
g6Nk9SdgLWc_2 ONE IMPORTANT BEEF IS THAT YOU CAN USE IS THE ONE THREE ONE
g6Nk9SdgLWc_3 HI I'M TRAVIS AND THIS IS A ONE THREE ONE
g6Nk9SdgLWc_4 NEW SETTING UP A ONE THREE ONE FIRST OF ALL IN ONE IS SET UP WHERE YOUR POINT GUARD IS AT THE TOP THE KEY AROUND IS THERE
g6Nk9SdgLWc_5 NOW AND DEPENDING ON HOW THE PENALTY OFF IS THAT THEY'RE PLAYING AND HOW OF THAT GIVE THAT OFTEN SEE IS THAT WILL DETERMINE HOW FAR YOU POINT GUARD WILL GO OUT
g6Nk9SdgLWc_6 NOW IT IS A TEAM THAT'S NOT REALLY SHOOTING A LOT OF JUMP SHOTS AND ARE NOT REALLY HITTING LET A JUMP SHOTS AND THEY'RE REALLY PENETRATE AND PAINT YOU MIGHT ONE A PACK IT IN A LITTLE BIT
g6Nk9SdgLWc_7 YOU POINT GUARD MIGHT ONE COME DOWN IN THE INSIDE HERE
g6Nk9SdgLWc_8 ONCE YOU GET BUT THAT'S THAT POINT GUARDS AREA THIS IS ALL OF HIS AREA HIS OR HER AREA
g6Nk9SdgLWc_9 WE'LL PLAY ANYTHING UP HERE THIS IS THEIR SPOT
g6Nk9SdgLWc_10 THEN YOU HAVE THE THREE WHICH IS OR SECOND IF INJURED THREE IN THE MIDDLE
g6Nk9SdgLWc_11 SO YOU HAVE THE POINT GUARD UP TOP BATTLE FOLD RIGHT HERE A THINNER WILL BE A LITTLE FURTHER BACK WHICH IT WHAT YOU HAVE IS YOU HAVE A SMALL FOUR YEAR AGO HAVE THE SHOOTING GUARD ON THE OTHER SIDE SUPPORT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEFENSE
g6Nk9SdgLWc_12 SO YOU HAVE A SMALL FLOORED POWER FOR IT ALONG THE MIDDLE AND YOU'LL HAVE THE SHOOTING GUARD ON THE OTHER SIDE
g6Nk9SdgLWc_13 NOW YOU MAY OR MAY NOT WANT THE OUTSIDE PLAYERS A FORWARD AND SHOOTING GUARD TO MOVE UP A LITTLE BIT OF THIN THAT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU WANT A HIGH YOU WANNA RUN
g6Nk9SdgLWc_14 BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE PREMISE IN EACH OF THOSE WILL HAVE RESPONSIBILITY OF GETTING ANYTHING THAT COMES IN AT PAY
g6Nk9SdgLWc_15 THE BALL OR ACTUALLY SMALL FOR WILL HAVE THIS RESPONSIBILITY I HEAR ANYTHING BEYOND THAT POINT GUARDS REACH IS ON ON THIS SIDE OF THE COURT WILL BE THAT SMALL FORCE RESPONSIBILITY
g6Nk9SdgLWc_16 ON THE OTHER SIDE SAME THING WITH SHOOTING GUARD ANYTHING OVER THEIR PASS THE POINT I WILL BE THAT POINT THAT SHOOTING GUARD RESPONSIBILITY
g6Nk9SdgLWc_17 NOW IF IT GETS PASS THESE THIS SECOND ON A DEFENSE DAY IN THAT HERE YOU'LL HAVE THE CENTER WHICH IS AGAIN IN THE CENTER IT WILL BE THE ONE THAT HOLDS THE PAINT DOWN IN IS IN THE MIDDLE ANYTHING THAT IS FAT THAT OUT OF THE FENCE IS HIS OR HER RESPONSIBILITY
g6Nk9SdgLWc_18 THERE YOU HAVE IT A ONE THREE ONE LEAVE
_GtKZbzWBig_1 IS EXERCISES THAT AT A TARGET THE PECTORALS MAJOR OF THE LAST THE ADD DEALT AVOIDS AS WELL AS THE STABILITY OF HOLDING ITSELF INTO THAT BRIDGE POSITION
_GtKZbzWBig_2 SOME HOLD ON TO THE BALL IS YOU SLOWLY WALK YOURSELF OUT
_GtKZbzWBig_3 AGAIN IN THIS POSITION ONE LETS GET YOU HAD RESTING ON THE BALL AND NOT LETTING HIP SAGS OR EVEN USE THE GLUTES THE CONTRACT TO LIFT THE HIPS AND HAVE YOUR HEAD IN LINE WITH YOUR SPINE
_GtKZbzWBig_4 AND YOU TAKE THE WEIGHTS NOW AND LIFT
_GtKZbzWBig_5 WE'RE GOING OVER THE HEAD AND PULLING BACK OVER THE CHEST
_GtKZbzWBig_6 SO I'M EXTENDING OVER THE HEAD AND IN THIS ACTION HERE IS WHEN THE LATS AGAIN A KICK IN WHICH OF THE LETTERS MOST OF THE BACK AND ALSO THE PECTORALS MAJOR
_GtKZbzWBig_7 SOME EXPANDING THE CHEST
_GtKZbzWBig_8 BUT I DON'T WANT TO HAPPEN IS LETTING THE RIB CAGE POP UP
_GtKZbzWBig_9 SO THINK ABOUT TUCKING THAT RIB CAGE DOWN SQUEEZING UP WITH THE GLUTES AND THE HAMSTRINGS FINDING SO STABLE ON THE BOW EXTENDING THE ARMS OVER
_GtKZbzWBig_10 AND HERE YOU CAN ALSO CHANGE THAT SO THAT YOU COULD ADD A TRICEP PRESS OR A COMBINATION OF TRICEP WITH THAT OVERHEAD PRESS TARGETING SEVERAL MUSCLE GROUPS
_GtKZbzWBig_11 THE TRICEP HONESTLY DISC I'M INCORPORATES THE BACK OF THE ARM
_GtKZbzWBig_12 SHE YOU GET OUT OF THIS BRING THE WEIGHTS DOWN DROP THE HIPS LIFT THE HEAD AND WALK YOURSELF BACK UP ON THE BALL

GmXc6qvdMG8_1 AND MY NAME'S ADDISON FROM CAPTAIN BILLS HIM AND TEACH YOU HOW TO OVER AND SERVER VOLATILE
GmXc6qvdMG8_2 IN ORDER TO OVERHAND SURVIVAL ARE A COUPLE DIFFERENT MECHANICS YOU NEED TO USE
GmXc6qvdMG8_3 FIRST THINGS FIRST SHOE ALWAYS KEEP YOUR HAND OPEN
GmXc6qvdMG8_4 WHEN YOU KEEPING AN OPENING IT MORE SURFACE AREA ON THE BALL WHICH CAN HELP YOU TO GUIDE THE BALL TO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE COURT
GmXc6qvdMG8_5 SO WHEN YOU'RE SERVING VOLUME WARRIOR HAND OUT IN FRONT OF YOU WHO ARE TOSS THE BALL UP IN FRONT OF YOU SEE THAT THIS THAT AND HIT IT WITH THEIR HAND
GmXc6qvdMG8_6 WHEN YOU CONTACT THE BALL YOU WANT TO HIT IT ALMOST TO THE HEEL OF YOUR PALM AND IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR HAND
GmXc6qvdMG8_7 SO WHEN YOU TOSS THE BALL EVEN ON TAKING ELBOW BACK AND WHEN YOU HIT IN LEAD WITH THE ELBOW
GmXc6qvdMG8_8 SO YOU NEVER LEAD WITH THE HAND YOU ALWAYS LEAVE WITH YOUR ELBOW IT'LL HELP YOU TO GET THE BALL STRAIGHT OVER THE NET TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE SERVE
GmXc6qvdMG8_9 WHEN YOU SERVING A BALL TAKE THE BOTTOM FRONT OF YOU TOSS IT IN FRONT OF YOU FIGURE HAND BACK LEAD WITH THE ELBOW KEEP YOUR HAND OPEN AND SERVE THE BALL OVER THEM
GmXc6qvdMG8_10 AND THAT'S HOW YOU OVER HANSARD AVAILABLE

hIIw2GHVA1o_1 ALRIGHT GOOD FATS BAD FATS WHAT'S THE SKINNY ON FATS
hIIw2GHVA1o_2 WELL OF IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED DOVE THAN SOME OF MY THINK BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT
hIIw2GHVA1o_3 NOTICE SOME FATS THAT WE NEED JUST FINE VITAMINS EVERYDAY
hIIw2GHVA1o_4 THOSE ARE CALLED ESSENTIAL FATS AND ONE IS MIDDLEWEIGHT GAS
hIIw2GHVA1o_5 GIVE ONE IS CALLED LITTLE WHEN IT GETS IT
hIIw2GHVA1o_6 WHEN A LAKE BELONGS TO FAMILY CALLED ONLY GET SEX
hIIw2GHVA1o_7 LITTLE LETTING THE ONCE OF CHEMICAL OMEGA THREE OF <UNK>
hIIw2GHVA1o_8 MOST PEOPLE GET OF PREFER MOUNT YOU MAKE IS
hIIw2GHVA1o_9 X WHO'S YOU MAKE A THREE THESE DAYS THAT ON ATTRITION IS OUR OF RECOMMENDING FOR GOOD HEART HEALTH
hIIw2GHVA1o_10 THAT'S ONE THIS IS THE LACKING IN THE DIET OFF OF
hIIw2GHVA1o_11 SO OF WHAT LIGHT WE NEED FACTS
hIIw2GHVA1o_12 WELL WE NEED FATS FOR HORMONE PRODUCTION OF IN THE BODY FAT SQUASH AND THE ORGANS THE BRAIN IS SIXTY PERCENT FACT IS PRIMARILY THE OMEGA THREE FATS WE NEED FOR GOOD HEART HEALTH
hIIw2GHVA1o_13 SOME PEOPLE FEEL THAT THE OF THE PROBLEMS WE'RE HAVING THESE DAYS WITH HEART DISEASE AND ALTZHEIMER'S DISEASE HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE LAWS OMEGA THREE WAYS THAT WE NEED SO AS A RESULT OF OUR BRAINS ARE LITERALLY DRYING OUT FROM WITH TOO MUCH OF A BAD FATS NOT ENOUGH OF A GOOD OMEGA THREE FATS
hIIw2GHVA1o_14 INFORMATION IS OUT OF CONTROL ARE WHAT IS TOO THICK
hIIw2GHVA1o_15 SO THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THESE GOOD FATS OFF AND WHICH TO GET SOME HEALTHY FATS WITH EACH MAIL
hIIw2GHVA1o_16 THAT'S COME FROM SEEDS AND KNOTS OF THOSE TO BE THE VEGETARIAN SOURCES GOOD OILS LIKE ALL OF OIL ALSO FATTY MEETS WHICH WE SHOULD TRYING HOLD DOWN THE DOT
hIIw2GHVA1o_17 THOSE HARD FATS ON AND WE'VE MAKE CHOLESTEROL FROM THE HALF SO FROM ONE KEY FOR CHOLESTEROL DOWN IF THIN LEAF TEA TO GO WITH THE OF LOW FAT PROTEINS IN THE DIET LEAN PROTEIN AND EMPHASIZE THE LIQUID FAST THE ESSENTIAL FATS
hIIw2GHVA1o_18 THE ESSENTIAL FATS ON WE CAN GET FROM ON SEEDS AND KNOTS IN FISH ON WOULD BE GOOD SOURCES END OF OLIVE OIL OF COURSE
hIIw2GHVA1o_19 ALL OF OIL IS HOT PRIMARILY WHAT WE CALL MEGAN NINE WHICH IS NOT AN ESSENTIAL FAT THAT NEVER THE LESS IS A HEALTHY PFAFF AND GOT THIS CAN EVEN THE U.S FIRTH OPT LIGHT SAUT
hIIw2GHVA1o_20 WITH THE FLAX THOUGHT OIL AND IS NOT TO BE USED FOR CAULKING

hIIw2GHVA1o_26 EVEN COCONUT OIL WHICH IS A SATURATED FAT BUT IT IS A HEALTHY OIL HEALTHY FAT AND THIS HELPS US TO MAKE MORE OF THE HEALTHY CHOLESTEROL THE HD L'S
hIIw2GHVA1o_27 REMEMBER WE WANT A HIGHER PROPORTION OF THOSE HDL THE HEALTHY CHOLESTEROL
hIIw2GHVA1o_28 SO OF THE BAD FAT SO WE NEED TO AVOID WE CAN'T REALLY LEFT AND THEN FRYING FOR HEALTH FALL THOSE I SAY SOME LIGHT SAUTEING ON OCCASION IS FINE
hIIw2GHVA1o_29 RECENTLY ONE AVOID FATTY NEEDS BACON SAUSAGE HAND THIS TYPE OF THINGS CERTAINLY D FRIED FOODS
hIIw2GHVA1o_30 AND DON'T AS THEY SAY GET LITTLE HEALTHY FATS WITH EACH MEAL

HHTiIp9hYhA_3 HI ON WHAT I LIKE TO DO TO PRACTICE CATCHES FIRST OF ALL TO CATCH WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND IN YOUR LEFT HAND IS TAKE THE FIRST BEING CATCH IT LIKE THIS WITH YOUR LEFT HAND TOSS IT WITH YOUR LEFT HAND AND CATCH IT WITH THE RIGHT HAND
HHTiIp9hYhA_4 LEFT HAND RIGHT HAND
HHTiIp9hYhA_5 NOW WHEN YOU'RE FIRST STARTING TO CATCH A FRISBEE IT WAS AT THE CANNA PAY ATTENTION TO THE SPIN
HHTiIp9hYhA_6 WHEN THE FRIZZ BECOMES IN YOU DON'T WANT A CLOSURE HAND TOO EARLY YOU DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOUR HAND OPEN TOO LONG BECAUSE THE FRISBEE CAN THEN COMMAND AT YOUR HAND IN SPIN OUT
HHTiIp9hYhA_7 SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE TIMING IN THE HAND EYE COORDINATION TO SQUEEZE IT RIGHT AT THAT PERFECT MOMENT
HHTiIp9hYhA_8 NOW THE FIRST KNEES UP HIGH FOR ONE HAND A CATCHY THEN HAVE YOUR THUMB UNDERNEATH
HHTiIp9hYhA_9 AND IN THE FRISBEE IS LALL IF YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR THUMB ON THE TOP LIKE THIS
HHTiIp9hYhA_10 NOW AGAIN YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE FIRST STARTING TO CATCH FRISBEES BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IT SPINNING IT HAS A LOT OF SPIN AND IT HITS YOUR PALM TENNIS BEEN RIGHT OUT
HHTiIp9hYhA_11 AND IF YOU IF THE FRISBEE COMES IN A NEW CLOSURE HAND TOO EARLY IT'LL HIT YOUR HANDS ANNUAL VIOLA CATCH IT
HHTiIp9hYhA_12 SO PRACTICE THESE ON YOUR OWN IT REALLY EASY TO DO IN YOU SHOULD HAVE A LOT OF DESCENT SUCCESS

GrpCfdjXucE_2 I'M MICHAEL CEDAR
GrpCfdjXucE_3 IN THIS CLIP WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT MANAGING THE REFLECTIONS ON YOUR PIECE OF JEWELRY
GrpCfdjXucE_4 IN THE EARLIER THAT WE TALKED ABOUT MANAGING THE REFLECTION FROM YOUR LIGHTS
GrpCfdjXucE_5 THE BEST WAY OF DOING THAT IS DIFFUSING THEM EITHER LIKE TEN OR SEE SEE HERE IT PUTS A MONTH DIFFUSION MATERIAL ON TOP OF OUR LIGHT SO THEY'RE NOT AS BRIGHT THAT A LITTLE MORE EVEN
GrpCfdjXucE_6 THE NEXT THING YOU WANT TO BE CONCERNED WITH AN THIN LOOK AT IS ONE OF THE SURROUNDINGS OR BEING REFLECTED
GrpCfdjXucE_7 I CAN SEE PARTS OF THE OUT ROUTE HERE IN THE GLASS AS WELL AS ON THE OFF THE US STAINLESS STEEL OF THIS PARTICULAR WATCH
GrpCfdjXucE_8 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS BUILD OUR OWN LITTLE ENCLOSURE AROUND THIS TO MANAGE THE REFLECTIONS
GrpCfdjXucE_9 IT'S TAKEN A CLAP BUT NOT HE'S WHITEBOARD
GrpCfdjXucE_10 OF PUT THAT IN THE AIR TO MANAGE THE A REFLECTIONS COMING OFF IN THE ROOM
GrpCfdjXucE_11 I'M NOT AN EASY GOLD REFLECTIVE BECAUSE THAT SECOND THE APPROPRIATE FOR US STEAM THE STEEL OR A WHITE GOLD
GrpCfdjXucE_12 THAT'S ANOTHER REFLECT IS HERE AGAIN SILVER ON ONE SIDE WHITE ON THE OTHER
GrpCfdjXucE_13 REALLY IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TRIAL AND ERROR HERE
GrpCfdjXucE_14 THE SILVER IS GET A BRING OUT THE COLOR OF THE METAL A LITTLE MORE INTENSELY
GrpCfdjXucE_15 I CAN BE WILL DEEPER AND DARKER
GrpCfdjXucE_16 IF YOU USE THE WHITE SIDE OF THE METAL IS GIVEN LOOK A LITTLE MORE GRAY I'M A LITTLE MORE TO FUSE AS WELL
GrpCfdjXucE_17 SO IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF LOOK YOU'RE GOING FOR
GrpCfdjXucE_18 AFTER YOU'VE MANAGE ALL THE OTHER REFLECTIONS AND DIFFUSION LIGHTS LASTING WANT THINK ABOUT IS HOW YOU MEANS REFLECTION OF YOU AND THE CAMERA
GrpCfdjXucE_19 AND THAT OFTEN IS ONE OF THE MOST REVEALING OF REFLECTIONS WITHIN A PIECE OF REFLECTIVE JEWELRY
GrpCfdjXucE_20 WILL RUIN A DUE TO MANAGE ARE REFLECTION AND OUT OF THE CAMERA USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
GrpCfdjXucE_21 VERY SIMPLE A PIECE OF IT WITH A WHOLE CUT INTO IT
GrpCfdjXucE_22 WHAT TO DO IS JUST HOLD THAT OVER THE CAMERA WHEN YOU'RE SHOOTING A AND YOU BEHIND THAT ENDS AND REALLY ONLY IN A SHOW THE UP THE FRONT END OF A LENS AND MINIMIZE ANY BLACK SPOTS ON THE REFLECTION
GrpCfdjXucE_23 SO AGAIN WHEN YOU MANAGING REFLECTION ON YOUR JEWELRY EVEN THINK ABOUT THE LIGHTS YOU THING ABOUT SURROUNDINGS IN YOU THINK ABOUT MANAGING REFLECTION OF YOURSELF AND CAN

GpFelEBDJ_g_1 I'M TIM GIPSON I'M A TALK ABOUT HOW TO SELECT CARPET FOR YOUR ROOM
GpFelEBDJ_g_2 NOW IT'S LIKE INCORPORATE IT REALLY DEPENDS ON OF WHAT TYPE OF ROOM
GpFelEBDJ_g_3 NOW NEXT DECAL ROOM WE GET A WALL TO WALL CARPET AND THEN WE'VE ALSO GET AN ACCENT RUB THAT'S BEEN PUT IN HERE
GpFelEBDJ_g_4 EVEN AREAS THAT YOU HAVE HARDWOOD FLOORS ARE EVEN TILE YOU MAY SELECT US SOME AREA RUGS THAT OF BRING SOME ELEMENTS OF WARMTH AND DESIGN IN THE RING ON BUT ALSO PROTECT PROTECTOR MAIN CARPET ON A IN HIGH TRAFFIC OR HIGH WHERE AREAS
GpFelEBDJ_g_5 SO WHEN YOU LOOK AS SELECTING YOUR CARPET FOR YOUR ROOM A A BASIC CONSIDERATION IS A HOW MUCH TRAFFIC ARE YOU GETTING AND THAT MAY DEPEND ON THE TYPE OF CARPET THAT YOU GO WITH
GpFelEBDJ_g_6 AND ALSO IF YOU RE CARPETING ROOM YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP IN MIND ON ITS FOURS THE STYLE THAT TYPE OF CARPET THAT YOU USE IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO ON AT A RESALE VALUE TO YOUR HOME

GpFelEBDJ_g_8 SO TYPICALLY ON A WALL TO WALL YOU MAY WANT A PICK CARPETS THAT ARE MORE NEUTRAL HIGH AND SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN ADD A AREA CARPETS THAT CAN BE ACCENTED SO THAN IT TO THEY WILL MAINTAIN THE VALUABLE AND THE RESELL ABILITY ANA OF YOUR OF YOUR HOME
GpFelEBDJ_g_9 NOW IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE PARTICULARLY HIGH TRAFFIC AREAS AND THEN YOU MAY WANT CONSIST CONSIDER CARPET SUCH AS A BERBER THAT TEND TO BE A OF A MORE WEAR RESISTANT ON OUT OR IF YOU GO WITH SOME KIND OF A WALL TO WALL CARPET THAT HAS A SHADOW MANGO THE REALLY LOW PILE
GpFelEBDJ_g_10 NOW THE LOWER THE PILE THAN TYPICALLY MORE WEAR RESISTANT THOSE CARPETS WILL BE
GpFelEBDJ_g_11 SO I'M TIM GIPSON AND THAT'S SOME TIPS ON HOW TO CHOOSE CARPET FREE WERE

GP7mCgkwC-4_2 HI I'M GARY FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
GP7mCgkwC-4_3 NOW ONCE WE HAVE OUR DATA LET'S SEE HOW TO WORK WITH IT
GP7mCgkwC-4_4 THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT WE NEED TO BE SURE OF BEFORE WE JUST PUT OUR DOWN INTO THE LETTER
GP7mCgkwC-4_5 WE FIRST WHAT WE SEE THAT WE HAVE ALL OR FIELDS HERE
GP7mCgkwC-4_6 OF THOSE FIELDS HAVE TO BE MATCHED UP WITH THE FIELDS INSIDE THE MICROSOFT WORD PROGRAM
GP7mCgkwC-4_7 OTHER WAS WHEN I CREATED MY DATABASE I CREATED CONTACT LAST NAME AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT THE MICROSOFT WORLD WORD WILL RECOGNIZE IT S
GP7mCgkwC-4_8 SO ONE THAT WE HAVE TO DO IS WE HAVE TO ROUND AND WORK WITH OUR DATABASE WITH MAKE SURE THAT THAT ARE FIELDS ARE MATCHED UP AND ALL OF THESE FEEL THAT HAVE CHECK MARKS THOSE ARE THE ONES FROM A DATABASE THAT ARE GOING TO BE PUT INTO OUR LETTER
GP7mCgkwC-4_9 NOW WE MIGHT HAVE A DATABASE WE MIGHT SAY WELL THIS GUY DOESN'T THE LETTER OR HE GOT A LETTER LAST WEEK SO HERE YOU CAN PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH PEOPLE FROM YOUR DATA BASE I'M GOING TO RECEIVE THE DOCUMENT THE MALE MERCHANT YOU CREATING
GP7mCgkwC-4_10 YOU DON'T HAVE TO JUST PRINT EVERYTHING
GP7mCgkwC-4_11 YOU CAN PICK AND CHOOSE AND THESE ARE THE FIELDS ON THAT ARE GOING TO WANT TO LET HIM
GP7mCgkwC-4_12 SEE HERE THEY'RE CHECK MARKS FLEX THE BLANK FIELDS
GP7mCgkwC-4_13 THOSE CAN HAPPEN IS ONE THEM WHEN THE WHEN THE INFORMATION IN WHEN WE CLICK ON THE AND WHEN WE PUT TO PUT THE INFORMATION INTO A LETTER THESE FIELD ARE GOING TO THE BLANK BECAUSE IS NO INFORMATION THERE AND SO ALL OF THESE FEEL THAT WE SEE HERE THEY'RE GOING TO CREATE BLANK PAGES WITH OUR FROM OUR DOCUMENT
GP7mCgkwC-4_14 THE TOP AND IT WILL BE THERE THAT'S ON THE FIELD WILL BE AND DO
GP7mCgkwC-4_15 SO INSTEAD OF TAKING EACH CHECK MARK OUT OF THOSE BLANK FEEL THE EASIEST THING TO DO IS REALLY OF A FEW NAMES WE WANT TO USE IS TO CLEAR ALL AND EVERYTHING WILL BE EMPTY AND THEN IT'S MUCH EASIER JUST TO CHECK THE ONES WE WANT INSTEAD OF GOING ALL THE WAY DOWN THE LIST AND UNCHECK THE EVERYTHING
GP7mCgkwC-4_16 SO THIS IS THE FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH OUR DATABASES SELECT OUR RECIPIENT'S AND THAT'LL HELP US V <UNK> THE SIX IN TIME LATER ON WE GO AHEAD AND PRINT OR LETTERS
GP7mCgkwC-4_17 AND SO WE SEE HERE THAT ARE DATABASES SELECTED THAT'S NAME OF THE FILE AND WE'RE READY TO FOR OUR NEXT STEP

G_q2GdcAglE_1 IN THIS VIDEO I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT CLUB BALANCE
G_q2GdcAglE_2 NOW THIS IS A MEDIUM TO HARDEN CLUB TRICK
G_q2GdcAglE_3 REALLY YOU CAN INCORPORATE IT INTO A BALL PATTERN THAT YOU CAN BALANCE ANYTHING YOU WANT ON
G_q2GdcAglE_4 JUGGLERS WITH AS LIKE TRADITIONALLY JUGGLERS WILL DO A IN A PATTERN
G_q2GdcAglE_5 THE BOUNCE IT JUGGLING CLUB ON THE CHIN
G_q2GdcAglE_6 ON THE LAW JUGGLERS DEUCE GETS WITH ABOUT LIKE A TABLE A CHAIR KELEHER ON THE CHIN
G_q2GdcAglE_7 ALL THIS CRAZY STUFF
G_q2GdcAglE_8 REALLY BOUNCING SOMETHING ON EACH END IS NOT TAKE AS LONG AS YOU MIGHT THINK
G_q2GdcAglE_9 ON FOR HOW TO DO IT OVER TOP OF SAY WHAT LOOKS LIKE
G_q2GdcAglE_10 THIS IS A CHIN BALANCE
G_q2GdcAglE_11 YOU CAN SEE I'M CONSTANTLY ADJUSTING MYSELF SO THAT I I KEEP THE CLUB DOWN STAY ON THE FACE
G_q2GdcAglE_12 IT ALSO PRETTY COMMON TO DO ONE ON THE NOSE LIKE THAT OR THE FOREHEAD UP LIKE THAT
G_q2GdcAglE_13 NOW TO LEARN HOW TO DO THIS WE MIGHT WANT TO DO IS FIND SOMETHING LONGER THAN THE STANDARD JUGGLING CLUB
G_q2GdcAglE_14 THE LONGER IT IS THE SLOWER IT FALLS DOWN AND THE MORE TIME YOU HAVE TO RESPOND
G_q2GdcAglE_15 ANOTHER HELPFUL THING IS IF THERE'S MORE WEIGHT CONCENTRATE ON THE FAR AND OFF
G_q2GdcAglE_16 ON THE ROD PEOPLE ARE NOT A BALANCE WITH A BROOM
G_q2GdcAglE_17 A BROOM HAD ON THE FAR AND IT'S TALL IT'S HEAVY ON THE FAR IN
G_q2GdcAglE_18 WILL FALL ON REALLY SLOW
G_q2GdcAglE_19 IF YOU DECIDE RUN OVER UNDERNEATH IT AND TAKE IT BACK UP
G_q2GdcAglE_20 ON A GOOD WAY TO LEARN HOW TO DO IT WITH BUT WITHOUT JUGGLING CLUBS SPECIFICALLY IS PUT OUR BEAN BAG ON THE TOP OF THE CLUB
G_q2GdcAglE_21 WHAT THIS WILL DO IS IS A BEAUTY SOMETHING FOCUS ON WE WOULD HAVE THE TIP OF THE CLUB GO SLOW THE FALL DOWN A LITTLE BIT
G_q2GdcAglE_22 WE WANT TO DO IS FOR THE BALL ON THE TOP OF THE CLUB LOOK AT THAT BALL
G_q2GdcAglE_23 <UNK> THE FUR THIS POINT YOU CAN POSSIBLY SEE IF THE DRYING IT THAT BALANCE IS CLEAN IS AGAIN
G_q2GdcAglE_24 THAT WE CAN WORK IS INTO THE PATTERN AND DO SOME PRETTY AWESOME THINGS WITH THAT
gBxfuKjRCc8_1 PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT AFFINITIES OF DIFFERENT GETS IN AND IT'S REALLY REALLY THAT THIS IS MY GIFT AND IT'S WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BEGIN
gBxfuKjRCc8_2 I HAD THE AWKWARD THE DOT OPPORTUNITY CAME ABOUT NINE YEARS AGO A LEVER NINE YEARS AGO EYE
gBxfuKjRCc8_3 JUST BEING RAISED IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ON IN AND DID THAT THAT AGAIN I'M JUST DIDN'T THAT IT WASN'T EVER AN OPTION THAT IT WAS A JOB
gBxfuKjRCc8_4 IT WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU DAY ADD ON SO THEN WHENEVER I WENT TO SCHOOL AND I'M A DEGREE IN PHYSICAL THERAPY AN WAS DOING MAT WITH HUMANS AND BUT YET STILL BE NO WORKING IN THE ANIMAL IN ANIMAL WORLD ANIMAL CARE WORLD VOLUNTEERING IN THE OVEN AND THAT'S HOW THIS INVOLVED
gBxfuKjRCc8_5 IT HIM DOES LEAD TO IT
gBxfuKjRCc8_6 AND I DON'T REALLY RECALL EVER REALLY WANTING TO BE IN THE BE ANYTHING AT NIGHT
gBxfuKjRCc8_7 INITIALLY INK MAT A IN EYE ON IT BECAUSE I JUST ADDED ACTING
gBxfuKjRCc8_8 <UNK> IS AN <UNK> AND THAT A LOT OF ACTING IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE UNEVEN AFTER COLLEGE YOU NICE I GUESS IT AT SOME POINT I WANTED TO BE AN ACTRESS

GW_3gR4MCZg_1 ALRIGHT THE DRINK WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE IS CALLED AGEE'S MY LITTLE ROUX

GW_3gR4MCZg_3 AND WHEN YOU A HALF A SHOT OF ONE FIFTY ONE
GW_3gR4MCZg_4 AT THIS DRINK YOU'D USUALLY LIE ON FIRE
GW_3gR4MCZg_5 AND ONE FIFTY ONE CAN HELP THAT
GW_3gR4MCZg_6 UNFORTUNATELY OF DUE TO FIRE CODES IN THIS PARTICULAR BAR WE CANNOT DO THAT
GW_3gR4MCZg_7 SO NEXT <UNK> AS SHOT HALF A SHOT OF TEQUILA I KNOW YOUR UPSET BUT KEEP WATCHING

hBBid5RhYJk_1 THE NEXT STEP IN HELPING YOUR PET COAT WITH ARTHRITIS AND SHOULDERS IS ACTUALLY MASSAGE BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES FROM RAVEN DOWN THROUGH THIS AREA
hBBid5RhYJk_2 AND THE REASON FOR THIS IT IS WHEN ONE LEG IS INJURED WHEN THERE'S ARTHRITIS AND ONE SHOULDER THE OTHER LEG CARRIES MOST OF THE WEIGHT DOES EXTRA OF WORK
hBBid5RhYJk_3 THE BODY TENDS TO GET OUT OF PHYSICAL BALANCE SO THE DOG WILL STAMP SLIGHTLY CROOKED PUTTING THE WEIGHT ON ONE LEG RATHER THAN THE OTHER
hBBid5RhYJk_4 I'M MASSAGING THIS AREA IN BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES THAT HELP EASE SOME OF THE TENSION IS THE MUSCLES TO THE MUSCLES TIGHTEN UP TO COMPENSATE YOU'RE WANTING TO MASSAGE THROUGH THERE THAT WILL USE THAT TENSION IN HELP THE TWO LEGS TO BE MORE BALANCE TO HELP THE DOG STAND MORE EVENLY
hBBid5RhYJk_5 AND THAT WILL PUT LESS PRESSURE ON A GOOD LEG AND ALLOW THEM TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE
hBBid5RhYJk_6 SO THAT'S WHEN YOU MOST IMPORTANT MASSAGE POINTS WHEN YOU WERE TO THE SHOULDER INJURY FROM THIS HELPS KEEP THESE TWO SHOULDERS AT THE SAME HEIGHT
hBBid5RhYJk_7 WHAT YOU SEE IN A DOG WHO HAS A PROBLEM IS ONE SHOULDER BONE WILL ACTUALLY SIT HIGHER THAN THE OTHERS IF YOU FEEL IT YOU FEEL ONE HIGHER THAN THE OTHER AND THAT'S WHEN THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT

hjzcMrlaP58_3 THE CORRECT WAY TO SHARPEN A SERRATED KNIFE IS TO GET SOME KIND OF AROUND SHARPENING INSTRUMENT I SUGGEST CERAMIC
hjzcMrlaP58_4 SOME PEOPLE WILL USE RAT TAIL FILES I SUGGEST SURRENDER AND WHICH YOU NEED TO DO IS GOING EACH LITTLE GROOVE SEPARATELY
hjzcMrlaP58_5 IF THEY'RE SHARPEN EACH LITTLE GROOVE

gNRVAI30QrA_1 HI THIS IS GARY ZYER FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
gNRVAI30QrA_2 THAT'S NOT TAKE A LOOK AT THE ACTUAL PLAY THE GAME
gNRVAI30QrA_3 A NORMAL TURN CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS THE DRAW AND THE DISCARD
gNRVAI30QrA_4 THE PLAYER HAS TIME IT IS STARTS BY DRAWING OR TAKING ONE CARD FROM EITHER THE TOP OF THE STOCKPILE OR THE TOP CORD ON THE DISCARD PILE AND ADDING IT TO HIS HAND
gNRVAI30QrA_5 THE DISCARD PILE IS FACE UP C C IN ADVANCE WHICH ARE GETTING
gNRVAI30QrA_6 THE STOCKPILE HIS FACE DOWN
gNRVAI30QrA_7 SO IF YOU CHOOSE TO DRAW FROM THE STOCKPILE YOU DON'T SEE THE COLOR UNTIL AFTER YOU'VE COMMITTED YOURSELF TO TAKE IT
gNRVAI30QrA_8 IF YOU DRAW FROM THE STOCK YOU AT THE COURT TO YOUR HAND WITHOUT SHOWING IT TO THE OTHER PLAYERS
gNRVAI30QrA_9 IN THIS CASE WE'RE PLAYING WITH AN OPEN HAND
gNRVAI30QrA_10 TO COMPLETE YOUR TURN ONE CHORD MUST BE DISCARDED FROM YOUR HAND AND PLACED ON TOP OF THE DISCARD PILE FACE UP
gNRVAI30QrA_11 IF YOU STARTED TURN BY TAKING THE TOP CARD OF THE DISCARD PILE YOU MUST DISCORD A DIFFERENT CHORD FROM YOUR HAND
gNRVAI30QrA_12 TAKING THE TOP DISCORD AND PUTTING THE SAME CARD BACK IS NOT COMMITTED
gNRVAI30QrA_13 SO BE SURE THAT ONCE YOU TAKE THE CARD FROM THE DISCARD PILE BUT YOU REALLY DO IT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER TURN TO LAID BACK DOWN IN THE DISCARD PILE IF YOU DON'T
gNRVAI30QrA_14 IN MY CASE I DREW THE NINE OF SPACE FROM THE STOCKPILE
gNRVAI30QrA_15 NOW I'M HOLDING ELEVEN CARDS IN MY HAND
gNRVAI30QrA_16 I NEED TO GET RID OF ONE
gNRVAI30QrA_17 SO I CAN EITHER TAKE THE NINE OF STAYS OF A JUST PICKED IF IT DOESN'T HOLD MY HANDLE AND I CAN TAKE THAT ONE AND PUT IT INTO THE DISCARD PILE
gNRVAI30QrA_18 OR IF I DECIDE THAT I LIKE TO KEEP THE NINE OF STATES I WOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE ANOTHER COLOR FOR MY HAND AND PLAYS THAT CARTONS OF THE DISCARD PILE
gNRVAI30QrA_19 NOW WE CAN ONLY BE HOLDING ON TO TEN CHORDS AT ONE TIME
gNRVAI30QrA_20 SO THAT FINISHES THE SECOND PART OF A TURN THE DISCORD
gNRVAI30QrA_21 AND NOW PLAY GOES OVER TO THE OPPONENT

gs4LfF3KspA_31 THERE YOU HAVE THAT
H764PyicDGo_1 IN THIS SERIES WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT SOME MORE ADVANCE CLUB JUGGLING TRICKS
H764PyicDGo_2 NOW THE CLUB JUGGLING TRICKS ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM BALL JUGGLING TRICKS
H764PyicDGo_3 AGAIN LIKE THREE BALLS THERE ARE A MILLION THREE CLUB TRICKS AND A MILLION VARIATIONS ON EACH INDIVIDUAL TRICK
H764PyicDGo_4 YOU DON'T NEED WHEN THE BALL AND YOU PROBABLY HAVE YOUR OWN SPIN ON EACH INDIVIDUAL TRICK
H764PyicDGo_5 YOU DO YOUR OWN WAY
H764PyicDGo_6 JUGGLING IS A VERY VALUABLE PERFORMANCE DANSFORTH ACTIVE
H764PyicDGo_7 IF OFF ONE THING YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE IF YOU DON'T GET DISCOURAGED OF SOME OF THESE TRICKS
H764PyicDGo_8 SO THAT WILL NOT WORK A VERSE
H764PyicDGo_9 THAT WILL WORK FOR MONTHS FOR THAT AND IF YOU PRACTICE THEM ENOUGH THEY WILL WORK
H764PyicDGo_10 WE NEED TO DO IS PUT SOME TIME INTO IT WITH SOME AVERAGE INTO IT AND LEARN HOW TO DO EACH AND LITTLE TRICK PART BY PART
H764PyicDGo_11 THINK ABOUT BREAKING IT DOWN
H764PyicDGo_12 THING ABOUT THE TECHNIQUE OF YOUR THROWS AND MAKE SURE YOU KEEP YOUR POSTURE TO SAVE
H764PyicDGo_13 THREE ONE AT SHOULDER WIDTH APART WITH YOUR FEET STRAIGHT BACK NOT ARM TO NINETY DEGREES WHAT HE EVERYTHING GOOD
H764PyicDGo_14 YOU DON'T WANT TO LET THE THROWS EVOLVED INTO THAT THOSE AND JUST PRACTICE EACH TRICK PART BY PART AND THEN YOU BEAUTIFUL TOGETHER
gCqmjWeqtY4_1 OKAY AS NEXT LIVER AND TALK ABOUT THE ACTUAL DRAWER HANDLE ANNA OUT OF PROTECT THAT HER MEASURES PAINTED CORRECTLY ON SO THAT THE DOOR LOOKS GOOD
gCqmjWeqtY4_2 AND THAT'S THE OF THE IN COLOR
gCqmjWeqtY4_3 YOU ROLL IS DOOR LOOK GOOD IN THE DOOR HANDLE IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS THE MOST USE
gCqmjWeqtY4_4 AND REALLY HAVE KIDS OR A WHAT HE WILL GO IN AT A STORE UP INTO THE SEAT OF USE AND PAINT AROUND IT WILL SEE IT'S OF USE
gCqmjWeqtY4_5 YOU CAN USE YOUR SCREWDRIVER AND ACTUALLY TAKE THE DRAWER HANDLE OFF IF YOU KNOW HOW
gCqmjWeqtY4_6 IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW A DRAWER HANDLE WORSE I DON'T RECOMMEND IT BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE HIS GRIT EIGHT OLD ALMOND OF PAINTERS TAPE AND YOU WRONG SIMPLY WRAP IT AROUND THE INNER RENDA AND PROTECTED HANDLED
gCqmjWeqtY4_7 NOW WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IS BECAUSE THE GARAGE AUNG THEY OF THIS HOMEOWNER AS AN ACTUAL CHAIN LOCK ON THEIR DOUGH
gCqmjWeqtY4_8 OF ONE OF THE DOOR TO OF WAS PAINTED WAS ACTUALLY TAKEN OFF
gCqmjWeqtY4_9 SO WHAT I DO SUGGEST IS THAT WITH THIS THERE'S FOUR SCREWS USER VOLTAGE SCREWDRIVER AND SIMPLY REMOVE THAT FROM THE DOOR
gCqmjWeqtY4_11 AS THEY SHOULDN'T FILL UP THE HOLES WITH THE PAINT
gCqmjWeqtY4_12 NICK CHEWING THOSE HOLES THERE SO THAT THE <UNK> THAT WAS THE DOOR IS DRY
gCqmjWeqtY4_13 <UNK> IS OFF INTO WILL BE READY TO START WRITING
gCqmjWeqtY4_14 ANOTHER GOOD TIP FOR IT IS AND ONCE YOU GET ALL THIS OFF AND YOU UNDER SCREWS IN HERE OF HARDWARE IS DIGITAL CUP AND ENOUGH HAS EVERYTHING IN THERE
gCqmjWeqtY4_15 AND WE ARE SURE NOT TO OH LOSING THE HARMER OF REBECCA WOULD RUN

g8bWKxCobxY_1 RIGHT NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR VOICE
g8bWKxCobxY_2 THE FIRST THING ON ONE A TALK ABOUT IS THE VOICES OF THE CHARACTERS
g8bWKxCobxY_3 NOW YOUR PIECE MAY HAVE ONE OR TWO CHARACTERS IT MAY HAVE FIFTEEN CHARACTERS
g8bWKxCobxY_4 DON'T FOCUS ON CREATING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT VOICES IN ACCENTS FOR YOUR CHARACTERS
g8bWKxCobxY_5 THAT'S NOT NECESSARY
g8bWKxCobxY_6 WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR FIRST OF ALL IS SIMPLY VOLUME CAN WE HEAR YOU
g8bWKxCobxY_7 AND ARTICULATION CAN THE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
g8bWKxCobxY_8 BUT THEN ONE ARM THIS SUBTLE DIFFERENCE IS THAT YOU CAN ASSIGN TO EACH OF YOUR CHARACTER OF WAIST IS SO THAT WHEN THE AUDIENCE CAN TELL THEM APART
g8bWKxCobxY_9 PERHAPS ONE OF THEM TALKS AND LOWER WACE MANY WOMEN TALK A LITTLE FASTER
g8bWKxCobxY_10 DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT DEVELOPING THESE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT CHARACTERS BECAUSE YOU'VE GOTTEN YOUR RATION WACE IT'S GOING TO SAY SAID JAM SET SALLY SAID EARNEST DEFIANTLY SO THE AUDIENCE WILL ALWAYS NOW HIS SAND IT BECAUSE IN THE NARRATOR BUT IT HELPS TO HAVE SLIGHT DISTINCTIONS SLIGHT VOCAL CHANGES AMONG YOUR CHARACTERS
g8bWKxCobxY_11 NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NARRATOR
Gr-7Y16Eqm8_1 I SO HERE WE ARE WORTH WAITING FOR THE EARTH THE RESIN IF YOU'RE
Gr-7Y16Eqm8_2 OR AND LIKE I SAID THIS UV RESIN SAYS ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES LATER YOU CAN ALREADY SEE IF YOU CAN EVEN PUT A NAIL MARK IN THERE WHICH MEANS THAT THE DIRECTIONS JUNE EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD BE DOING WHICH IS F JUST CHEERING NOW AND THE UV WILL ACCELERATE THAT PROCESS
Gr-7Y16Eqm8_3 RATHER THAN THE FUNNY MATERIAL IT ALWAYS HERE FOR EVER SO IT NEVER STOP SECURING
Gr-7Y16Eqm8_4 WHAT YOU DO A REALLY WITH BAKOS CEILING AND THAT THE OF THE OF THE ELBOWS FUMES
Gr-7Y16Eqm8_5 SO REALLY OLD SURFBOARDS THEY GET BRITTLE UNTIE AND THE REASON WHY THEY GET BRIDLES BECAUSE THAT FIBERGLASS RATHER THAN CONTINUES THAT HERE
Gr-7Y16Eqm8_6 SO IF THIS IS ONE OF THE REAL GOOD CHANGES THAT SECURED IN THE IN THE FIBER GLASS OF RESIN FILLED OUT ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT THE CLEANING A LOT OF PRODUCTS UP AND ENOUGH THAT ARE <UNK>
g6IPyRwPX20_1 HI I'M JABARI PRIDE BACK WITH EXPERT VILLAGE SUCK ON <UNK>

g6IPyRwPX20_4 THE FIRST ONE IS NEVER NINETY DEGREES NINETY NINETY NINE
g6IPyRwPX20_5 FROM A NIGHT AND RING LETTER I'M ANGLED HER LEFT FOOT OF <UNK> MY LEFT HAND THING
g6IPyRwPX20_6 HAVING THE RIGHT LEG BACK IF ONE ANOTHER NINETY DEGREE ANGLE RIGHT HERE IN YOUR A THREE OR TWO GUYS
g6IPyRwPX20_7 WHEN I COME BACK AND BRING ANOTHER THIRD MENU
g6IPyRwPX20_8 SEE IT IN ONE SUIT IS THE THIRD NINETY TANGLES IN THE OPPOSITE LEG AND A FOURTH NINE <UNK> OTHER IN
g6IPyRwPX20_9 NOW IF YOU HAVE REALLY REALLY THAT FLEXIBILITY AND YOU CAN'T GET ALL FOUR NINETIES THIRTY MINUTE USE ONE OF BRING YOUR RELATE IT'S BACK
g6IPyRwPX20_10 BRING THAT ANGLE OF TOYS YOU'VE BOUGHT THIS IT'S A SOME THE STRESS OF THE KNEE
g6IPyRwPX20_11 METAL LIGHTS ACTUALLY LEAN FORWARD AND REACH FOR YOUR TOE OF THE TOOL IS FOR YOUR AND THIS IS THE SAME SIZE
g6IPyRwPX20_12 IT'S AS REACHING FORWARD YOU CAN FEEL THAT STRETCH IN A HAMSTRING
g6IPyRwPX20_13 NOW WE DO IN THE STRETCH IN ONE IT MOUNTS ITSELF YOU KNOW FOR BECAUSE IT HAPPEN IS IT'S REALLY AN UPPER CHANCE OF PULLING ANSWERING IN ONE DO THAT
g6IPyRwPX20_14 SEE JUST REACH SORT OF STRAIGHT NICE AND TALL INSERT REACHING
g6IPyRwPX20_15 AND WE'LL HURTS OR INTO ITS WILL LEVEL OF IN ACCOUNTABILITY CAN WITHSTAND
g6IPyRwPX20_16 WAS IT STEP WHITE STOP HOLD FOR THIRTY SECONDS IF HE'S OFF OF IT AND GO BACK AGAIN STRAPS UNTIL YOU KNOW IF IT'S THAT POINT WE CAN WITHSTAND VIA THE PAIN THE SCENE ANSWERS STRETCHING
g6IPyRwPX20_17 AND AS A COASTER
h1rlwq9Itwc_1 THE MARINE ORGANISM WE'RE GOING TO IDENTIFY NOW IS THE CLEANING ONLY
h1rlwq9Itwc_2 ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CLEANING FIFTH ONE WILL FALL IN ON A CORAL REEF IN THE CARIBBEAN IS THE CLEANING THE MOVIE
h1rlwq9Itwc_3 BUT THE CLEANING GOBI HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED IN THE WATERS AROUND FLORIDA
h1rlwq9Itwc_4 IT'S A SMALL FISH ONLY ABOUT AN INCH TO AN INCH AND THREE QUARTERS IN LENGTH
h1rlwq9Itwc_5 IT IS A LONG CIGAR FIT IT
h1rlwq9Itwc_6 SO IT'S MAXIMUM GIRTH IS NO MORE THAN A QUARTER OF AN INCH IN MOST SPECIMENS
h1rlwq9Itwc_7 CLEANING THOUGH THESE ARE HARD TO DIFFERENTIATE FROM A SIMILARLY COLLARED IN SIMILARLY SIZED SHARP NOSE GOBI
h1rlwq9Itwc_8 BOTH FISH HAVE A BRIGHT YELLOW V ON THEIR NOSE ALTHOUGH THE SHARP NOSE CAN HAVE A WHITE V
h1rlwq9Itwc_9 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THAT THE CLEANING DOBIES YELLOW V FADES INTO A PALE STRIPE AS IT PROGRESSES TOWARD THE TAIL
h1rlwq9Itwc_10 WHERE AS THE SHARP NOSE HAS THE V CONTINUE TO THE TAIL EITHER AS A CONTINUATION OF THE YELLOW COLOR OR AS A BRIGHT BLUE STRIDE
h1rlwq9Itwc_11 A SHARP NOSE GOBI WITH A WHITE V ON ITS NOSE WILL HAVE THE WHITE COLOR CONTINUE AS A WHITES RIGHT TO THE TAIL
h1rlwq9Itwc_12 THE REST OF THE CLEANING DOLBY USE BLACK OVER MOST WOODS BODY ALTHOUGH THE BELLY IS LIGHT COLORED WHITE OR WHITISH BLUE
h1rlwq9Itwc_13 CLEANING THOUGH THESE ARE USUALLY FOUND RESTING ON THE TOP OF CORAL HEADS AND USUALLY IN SMALL GROUP
h1rlwq9Itwc_14 THESE CONGREGATION'S OF CLEANING DOBIES FORM THE CLEANING STATIONS BETTER VISITED BY OTHER LARGER FISH
h1rlwq9Itwc_15 WHEN A LARGER FISH APPROACHES IT WILL HOPPER OVER THE CLEANING STATION AND THE CLEANING DOBIES GO TO WORK BY WORKING THE WAY ACROSS THE VISITORS BODY BEING THE ACTIVE PARASITES THAT ACCUMULATE ON THE BODY OF THESE DISHES
h1rlwq9Itwc_16 THE ZECCA PARASITES PROBABLY MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF THE CLEANING DOBIES DIE
h1rlwq9Itwc_17 ONE THING I LIKE TO DO WHEN I FIND ONE OF THE CLEANING GO BE CLEANING STATIONS IS THE SLOWLY EXTEND MY HAND TO THE AREA JUST ABOVE THE LIVING CORAL WHERE THE CLEANING DOBIES RESIDE AND HOLD IT STATIONARY FOR A MINUTE OR SO
h1rlwq9Itwc_18 MOST OF THE TIME THE CLEANING DOBIES WILL SWIM TO MY HAND AND START TO SWIM OVER IT CLEANING AWAY DEAD SKIN AND ANY OTHER THINGS THAT I FIND THAT THEY THINK SHOULDN'T BE THERE
h1rlwq9Itwc_19 IT'S A FUNNY FEELING WHEN THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SO SMALL AND LIGHT IT KIND OF GIGGLES AS THEY MOVE ACROSS YOUR HAND BETWEEN YOUR FINGERS AND STOP TO TARGET SOME LITTLE BIT OF GLUE SKIN
h1rlwq9Itwc_20 CLEANING THOUGH THESE ARE MONOGAMOUS FISH MEANING THEY MADE WITH THE SAME FISH REGULARLY
h1rlwq9Itwc_21 EGGS ARE LAID ON THE SUBSTRATE USUALLY UNDER A LEDGE AND THE MALE GENERALLY GUARDS THE EIGHT MASS
h1rlwq9Itwc_22 EGGS HATCH IN A FEW DAYS AND THE FRY DRIFT WITH THE CURRENT UNTIL THEY ARE A LARGE ENOUGH TO TAKE UP RESIDENCE ON THEIR OWN CORAL HEAD
h1rlwq9Itwc_23 I'VE SEEN SOME CLEANING STATIONS WITH SIX OR EIGHT CLEANING GO RESIGN IT OF VARIOUS SIZES AND AND OFTEN WONDERED IF IT WAS A FAMILY BUSINESS
h1rlwq9Itwc_24 I'LL NEVER KNOW FOR CERTAIN
h1rlwq9Itwc_25 THAT'S THE CLEANING OVER

GsuJmmXU5Qc_1 NOW WRITTEN DISCUSS WHAT VACCINATIONS CATS KNEE
GsuJmmXU5Qc_2 EVERY STATE REQUIRES DIFFERENT VACCINATIONS IS AN RABIES VACCINATIONS AND DIFFERENT INTERVALS OF ACID CHECK WITH YOUR STATE IS LARS RABIES VACCINATIONS CONCERN
GsuJmmXU5Qc_3 VACCINATION IS PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AND WHAT IS DOING IS BUILDING IMMUNITY OF OF THE CATS BOUGHT IN TOWARD WHILE INFECTIONS
GsuJmmXU5Qc_4 THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF VACCINATIONS THAT WE USE ESPECIALLY FOR OUTDOOR CATS
GsuJmmXU5Qc_5 I DON'T BID THE FIRST THING WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT IS RABIES VACCINATION AND RABIES VACCINATION IS TO PREVENT VIRAL INFECTION FROM RABIES THAT IS GENERALLY SEEN IN THE WILD HALF POPULATION AND WHILE LIFE POPULATION SUCH AS OF DIRECTIONS AND SKUNKS BASS THINGS LIKE THAT ALONG
GsuJmmXU5Qc_6 RABIES VACCINATION DOES VARY FROM STATE TO STATE ON AS FAR FAR AS HOW OFTEN THEY HAVE TO RECEIVE THAT
GsuJmmXU5Qc_7 THESE VACCINATIONS ARE GIVEN UNDER THE SKIN NUMB GENERALLY ONCE A YEAR AND ON OUR VERY EFFECTIVE AT PREVENTING RABIES
GsuJmmXU5Qc_8 ANOTHER VACCINATION THAT WE GIVE TO CATS OF I'M DEPENDING ON THEIR AGE AND IT'S GOING TO BE INDOOR OR OUTDOOR IS DISTEMPER WHICH IS A ESSENTIALLY AND EASY TERM OF UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS IN CATS
GsuJmmXU5Qc_9 THIS IS WHAT PREVENTS THAT
GsuJmmXU5Qc_10 THIS IS RUNNING TRAIT YADDA SCALISI VIRUS AND PAIN LEUKEMIA
GsuJmmXU5Qc_11 THOSE ARE THREE DIFFERENT VIRUSES THAT CATS AND GET AND CAN GET THAT IN THE DEVASTATING TO THEM ON SO THIS IS A GREAT PREVENTION THE KIECKER CATS HEALTHY ON AND TO RENT THOSE DISEASES
GsuJmmXU5Qc_12 THE THIRD ONE THAT WE VERY COMMONLY GIVE ESPECIALLY OUTDOOR CATS IS THE FELINE LEUKEMIA VACCINE
GsuJmmXU5Qc_13 THE ONLY KENYA IS A VIRUS THAT IN THE CONTRACT AND THROUGH ON BITE WOUNDS FIGHTS ON AND SECTION BEHAVIOR
GsuJmmXU5Qc_14 ESSENTIALLY THIS HIV VIRUS IS ONE OF THOSE THAT CAN BE DEADLY IF THEY CONTRACT
GsuJmmXU5Qc_15 MAKING CONTRACT THAT HAVEN'T FOR WHILE AND AGE AND GIVE THIS OTHER TAX AND THEN EVENTUALLY THEY CAN SUCCUMB TO THE DISEASE
GsuJmmXU5Qc_16 RABIES VACCINATION IS TO PREVENT ON RABIES WHICH AGAIN IS IS EVEN A WILDLIFE POPULATION MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND THAT IS A FAIL DISEASE BUT IT CAN BE VERY VERY WELL PREVENTED
GsuJmmXU5Qc_17 ALL THESE VACCINES ARE GENERALLY DRAWN OUT AND THEY'RE LIQUID FORM AND GIVEN UNDER THE SKIN ON DEPENDING ON HOW OFTEN THAT CAN BE ON ONCE A YEAR TO EVERY THREE YEARS
GsuJmmXU5Qc_18 ALSO WHEN THEY'RE CHOOSE A HAT OR THE BOOSTED GENTLY ONE VACCINE FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER ONE TO THREE WEEKS LATER AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED BY A THIRD ONE OF ON THE PAIN WHICH VACCINES USED
gQJlTBo6E6s_2 AND IT IS NATURAL IN HIGHEST LOOSE TO DISCUSS HOW TO SURVIVE HAS
gQJlTBo6E6s_3 CEPHAS WORD MOVING BEING PROGRESSIVE WITH YOUR LIFE
gQJlTBo6E6s_4 THEY DO OFFER A G D CLASSES AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET YOUR G D
gQJlTBo6E6s_5 THEY OFFER OUT COLLEGE COURSES IN ANY OF THE PRISON INSTITUTION'S IN A CERTAIN QUALIFICATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN GET INTO THOSE PROGRAMS
gQJlTBo6E6s_6 IF YOU DON'T MEATBALLS QUALIFICATIONS THERE'S PLENTY OF EDUCATION OUTSIDE OF THAT
gQJlTBo6E6s_7 I KNOW THAT WHEN I WAS INCARCERATED I WAS ABLE TO TAKE AN AMERICAN FINDING WHICH CHORDS
gQJlTBo6E6s_8 I DID COKE SHOWING CLASS
gQJlTBo6E6s_9 ON I ALSO TO THE SMOKING CESSATION CLASS AND READING RELAXATION TECHNIQUE CLAVE
gQJlTBo6E6s_10 WE GET CERTIFICATES ROBBIE'S CLASSES
gQJlTBo6E6s_11 IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS TRYING TO BE PULL ROLLED THE OR ARE LOOKING FOR SOME SORT OF CONDITIONAL RELEASE ALL OF THESE THINGS CAN BENEFIT SHOE
gQJlTBo6E6s_12 WE'LL SHOW THAT VIA THE SHOW THE THE SYSTEM ITSELF IS YOU ARE BASICALLY TRYING TO MAKE A CHANGE YOUR LIFE THAT ARE TRYING TO CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD AND NOT CONTINUE INDIA LIFESTYLE THAT MAN LANDED DO IMPRISONS TO BEGIN WITH
gQJlTBo6E6s_13 BUT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM THERE IS THE IS IF IMPERATIVE TO BE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
gQJlTBo6E6s_14 IF YOU LIKE TO SURVIVE AMEEN GENERALLY SURVIVE IN PRISON EXPERIENCE YOU CAN CONTINUE TO EDUCATE ITSELF
gQJlTBo6E6s_15 I THINK THAT'S VERY NECESSARY
g7L0oqiclpY_1 HI SO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A COMPLETELY FOLLOW AROUND HAS IF IT WERE GOING HALF COMPLETELY ALONG WITH THE CIRCULAR DIAGRAMS I THINK YOU CAN SEE MY POINT BEST IN THIS LITTLE ON THIS'LL DIAGRAM
g7L0oqiclpY_2 AND ALSO YOU WANNA BE SURE THAT THIS ENDS UP IN A PLACE THAT MAKES SENSE THIS ONE OF BEING A SMALLER CIRCLE IF YOU IMAGINE THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT IT ENDS HERE NOT NOT WE HAVE HERE BUT THEY'RE AND THIS ONE IS CAN END UP OUT A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THAN THAT
g7L0oqiclpY_3 PALM ALRIGHT SO THIS IS A SLIGHT LEAVE IF NICELY BETTER DRAWN HAS
g7L0oqiclpY_4 WHAT DO WE HAVE FOUR PASS
g7L0oqiclpY_5 WHO WILL OKAY SLOW DOWN OKAY
g7L0oqiclpY_6 THERE'S NO WAY TO GET A BEAUTIFUL LETTER ONTO THE PAGE ESPECIALLY IN THE BEGINNING IF YOU DON'T GO SLOWLY
g7L0oqiclpY_7 SENSUAL THERE IS A SENSUAL NATURE TO CALLIGRAPHY THE SAME IS THERE IS ESSENTIAL NATURE TO DANCE
g7L0oqiclpY_8 YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THEY CALL CALLIGRAPHY THE DANCE OF THE PAN
g7L0oqiclpY_9 IF IT WERE NOT SENSUAL IT WOULD NOT BE WORKING OR THE SHAPES OF THE LETTERS IN THE WAVE FORM THE LETTERS WOULD NOT BE WORKING WITH THE WEIGHT AND WE ARE DESIGNED AS PEOPLE AS HUMAN BEINGS SO YES IT HAS ESSENTIAL NATURE YES IT TAKES SCALE AND THE STUDYING OF THE SCALE HAS TO COME FIRST
g7L0oqiclpY_10 FIRST YOU GET THE SCALE AND THEN YOU GET THE CREATIVITY
g7L0oqiclpY_11 IT'S FACING OF COURSE IS A HUGE HUGE THING
g7L0oqiclpY_12 WE'VE TALKED ABOUT NEGATIVE SPACE NEGATIVE SPACE AND POSITIVE NEGATIVE SPACE
g7L0oqiclpY_13 THESE SO YOUR SPACING IS VERY IMPORTANT
g7L0oqiclpY_14 AND WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT SPACING AS TIME GOES ON
g7L0oqiclpY_15 BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S STICK WITH THE IDEA OF THE MODELS GETTING OUR BASIC STUFF DOWN

Hai5VmQsXhU_2 AND NOW WE'RE TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CANVAS AND PRINTING ON CANVAS
Hai5VmQsXhU_3 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT GUY YOU'LL RUN INTO WHEN YOU PRESS ON CANVAS IS THE PIECE THAT YOU RECEIVE WILL NOT BE A FINISHED PIECE ON LIKE PAPER THAT SHOULD PRETTY MUCH CAN PUT IN A LAWN WILL OPEN SELF
Hai5VmQsXhU_4 A CANVAS PIECE TYPICALLY IS THAT HAVE TO BE STRETCHED AND THAT'S ANOTHER STEP THAT'S INVOLVED IN WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE LATER
Hai5VmQsXhU_5 BUT WHAT IT INVOLVES WOULD BASICALLY MEANS IS YOU TAKE A PIECE A CANVAS LIKE THIS ANAND THROUGH A PROCESS THAT DUMB REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT OF WORK YOU END UP WITH A PRODUCT LIKE THIS WHERE IT'S TO BASICALLY WHAT THE WHAT'S BEEN HAPPEN IS THE A CANVAS IS WRAPPED AROUND SOME PIECES OF WOOD STRUCTURE BARS AND SECURED IN THE BACK
Hai5VmQsXhU_6 ANNICK BASICALLY IS READY TO HANG AT THAT POINT OR BE FRAME
Hai5VmQsXhU_7 SO THAT'S WHAT STRETCHING MEANS AND AND IT'S A LITTLE INVOLVE IT'S NOT A DIFFICULT PROCESS AND IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING YOU CAN DO YOURSELF OR YOU CAN PAY SOMEONE TO DO FOR YOU
Hai5VmQsXhU_8 SO THAT'S WHAT STRETCHING CANVAS THINGS

GPN8BxTQeBw_1 IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO DISCUSS X L ARE CABLES
GPN8BxTQeBw_2 XLR CABLES PRIMARILY ARE USED FOR MICROPHONE
GPN8BxTQeBw_3 BUT THEY COULD BE IMPORTANT AS A GUITAR PLAYER IF YOU'RE PLAYING AN ACOUSTIC GIG IN YOU WOULD NEED TO AMPLIFIER GUITAR IF IT DIDN'T HAVE A PLUG OUT
GPN8BxTQeBw_4 NO IT LOOKS SIMILAR TO AN INSTRUMENT CABLE IN ITS CONSTRUCTION HOWEVER THE PLUGS ARE DIFFERENT
GPN8BxTQeBw_5 THE THING I'LL SEE HERE THERE'S THREE PRONGS ON ONE AND
GPN8BxTQeBw_6 THIS WOULD BE THE MALE AND
GPN8BxTQeBw_7 AND THE FEMALE AND YOU SEE THAT'S WHERE THERE'S HOLES INSTEAD OF CLUBS
GPN8BxTQeBw_8 NOW THIS CABLE DIFFERS FROM INSTRUMENT CABLE IN THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH AND YOU USE
GPN8BxTQeBw_9 FOR EXAMPLE IF I TAKE A MICROPHONE HERE YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE MICROPHONE AS THE THREE PLUGS ON IT
GPN8BxTQeBw_10 YOU WOULD NEED TO USE THE FEMALE END TO PLUG INTO THE MIKE IN IN THE MAIL AND WOULD GO INTO THE AMPLIFIER

g_LPgfiX7Ik_1 OKAY FOLKS IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE A LIVING AS AN ARTIST
g_LPgfiX7Ik_2 UNLIKE SOME PROFESSIONS THEIR LITERALLY DOZENS IN DOZENS WAYS YOU CAN MAKE A LIVING AS AN ARTIST
g_LPgfiX7Ik_3 IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO SKETCH DROP PAINT DESIGN YOU WILL HAVE MANY MANY OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU
g_LPgfiX7Ik_4 ONE AREA AND GO INTO SCUFFING DESIGN
g_LPgfiX7Ik_5 THESE DAYS A LOT OF THAT'S DONE A COMPUTER NOT AS MUCH THREE AND ANYMORE BUT ADD USING COMPUTERS IS REALLY OPEN OF AN ARTIST WORLD AN ISLAND GIVE US YET ANOTHER TOOL WHICH TO CREATE IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE LEAVE THAT DIRECTION
g_LPgfiX7Ik_6 IF YOU MOVE IT MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY INCLINED IN A LIGHT HEATER HANDS DIRTY GO AS MUCH THAT MIGHT BE REALLY GOOD OPTION FOR YOU
g_LPgfiX7Ik_7 AS LONG CREATIVITY LATA VERSATILITY IN THAT I'M IN A WIDE VARIETY OF JOBS ARE DESIGNERS
g_LPgfiX7Ik_8 ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE A LIVING AS AN ARTIST WOULD BE TO BECOME I'VE GRAPHIC NOVEL ARTIST TO OR ANIMATOR MAYBE
g_LPgfiX7Ik_9 THESE ARE AND VERY VERY DIFFERENT FROM GRAPHIC DESIGN OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO HAVE A MUCH BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF OF DIMENSIONS SHAPES IN TERMS OF THE HUMAN FORM AND I ALSO MOVEMENT THAT SKEET AS WELL TO CREATE PANELS ON A COMIC STRIP OR ESPECIALLY TO CREATE ANIMATION AND BE AND JOHN ANIMATED WHICH IS AN ARRAY READ THESE DAYS BUT TO BE EITHER ONE YES IT IT WILL UNDERSTAND HUMAN FORM HOW OF THE BODY MOVES AND BE ABLE TO DRAW WITHIN THOSE PARAMETERS
g_LPgfiX7Ik_10 THERE IS A GREAT DEAL MONEY TO BE MADE IN THIS FIELD BECAUSE IT'S VERY THAT GOT MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD AT THIS PARTICULAR SCALE SO IF YOU FIND YOURSELF BILLY PASSIONATE FEELING PASSION ABOUT DRAWING THESE TYPES OF UP ON THE EDGES THEN ABSOLUTELY GO FOR THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS THE BULLET YOUR PORTFOLIO IN AND JUST A MINUTE TO DIFFERENT EITHER AGENCIES OR ACTUAL PUBLISHERS OR ANIMATED HOW'S IT THEMSELVES
g_LPgfiX7Ik_11 WHICH FOR THE DOOR AND WORK YOUR WAY UP FROM THERE
g_LPgfiX7Ik_12 ANOTHER WAY AND IN MY MIND IS WOULD BE JUST BUT EVERY ARTIST RING IS TO MOVE TO SOME CLAY SLIGHT NEW YORK PARIS ITALY SOME VALUE EXOTIC IT OR LOCATION ANYWHERE LIKE THAT OPEN UP YOUR LITTLE ART GALLERY YOUR VERY OWN LARGE GALLERY AND JUST PAINT
g_LPgfiX7Ik_13 DESIGN DRAW WHATEVER FROM YOUR OWN STUDIO AND THEN YOU KNOW I'VE PEOPLE IN OF WALKING OFF A STREET DEPRECIATE YOUR WORK HAVEN'T YOU NOTICE PLATING GALLERIES ACROSS THE WORLD HAND IN HOW LIVINGOOD LIFE BASICALLY
g_LPgfiX7Ik_14 NOW THIS IS YOUR EVEN ASPIRATION IF YOU FEEL IT YOU HAVE A SKIP THE SKILL IN THAT PASSION GO FOR A THING THAT'S THE MOST NOBLE WAY IN MY MIND TO MAKE A LIVING AS AN ARTIST
g_LPgfiX7Ik_15 TO DO A LITERALLY ON YOUR OWN LIVE IN OFF YOUR WORK IN ON YOUR OWN BOSS MAJOR HOURS OR LIT ISN'T IT MUCH BETTER THAN THAT
g_LPgfiX7Ik_16 TO BECOME A SUCCESS ADDED THEN THIS GUY'S A LEMON
g_LPgfiX7Ik_17 YOU OFFICIALLY ARRIVED
g_LPgfiX7Ik_18 AND THESE ARE JUST A FEW WAYS TO MAKE A LIVING AS AN ARTIST

GFttwLutLSY_3 AND WHAT IT HAZARDS IT HAS A CONDENSER MOTOR IN THE BASE OF THE REFRIGERATOR AND INTO THE IN THE BACK HERE
GFttwLutLSY_4 AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT TAKES A REFRIGERANT AND IT CIRCULATES IT OVER THROUGH SOME EVAPORATOR COOLS SO THAT THE HEAT IS RELEASED IN AS THE HEATED RELEASE THE GETS THE REFRIGERANT GETS VERY COLD AND YOU'LL HAVE A THING AND SO YOU'LL HEAR REFRIGERATOR AND ACTUALLY HURT RUNNING AND THERE'S TWO THING TO DO
GFttwLutLSY_5 THERE'S A FAN THAT STRONG SOME AIR AND THEN THERE'S ALSO COMPRESSOR THAT'S TAKING THAT REFRIGERANT AND AS IT GOES THROUGH THE SYSTEM IT'S COMPRESSING IT BACK SO THAT AS IT COMES BACK EXPANDS AGAIN IT RELEASES IT'S HE COMES VERY COLD AND ACTUALLY CIRCULATE THROUGH THE REFRIGERATOR AND MAKE THE REFRIGERATOR COLD
GFttwLutLSY_6 AND THAT AIR CIRCULATES FROM THE FRONT HERE CIRCULATES THROUGH AN OUT THE BACK AND THEN INSIDE REFRIGERATOR AND GENTLY TO THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF A ELECTRONIC CONTROLS WRITTEN ACTUALLY SET THE EXACT TEMPERATURES AND THEN AS THE AIR BLOWS OVER THE COILS IN GET VERY COLD THEN IT IS BLOWN INTO THE REFRIGERATOR BOX AND KEEPS ACTUALLY COLD AIR CIRCULATING HERE TO WHATEVER TEMPERATURE YOU NEED FREE REFRIGERATOR OR FOR YOUR FREEZER

hI-IRsEQw7E_1 HI I'M DEBRAH DEMIRZA
hI-IRsEQw7E_2 AND I'M AT DELUXE A RESALE CLOTHING BOUTIQUE IN EUGENE OREGON
hI-IRsEQw7E_3 AND TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO REPAIR A HIM
hI-IRsEQw7E_4 THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY COME ALL THE WAY OUT
hI-IRsEQw7E_5 THE NICE THING ABOUT THIS ONE IS ALREADY HAS THE SEAM BINDING AROUND IT TO KEEP THE WRONG EDGES FROM FRAME
hI-IRsEQw7E_6 AND WHAT I USUALLY DO IS I START ON THE INSIDE THEME OF THE PANT LEG SO IT DOESN'T SHOW THAT MUCH
hI-IRsEQw7E_7 I AM GETTING USE A CONTRAST AND THREAD JUST SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT I'M DOING HERE
hI-IRsEQw7E_8 AND I NEVER START MY SEWING WITH THAT A AND NOT I STARTED WITH THE THREE LITTLE LOOPS
hI-IRsEQw7E_9 AND I DO IT ON THE PART THAT'S NOT BEEN AND SHOW ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PANTS
hI-IRsEQw7E_10 SO I JUST DO THREE LITTLE LOOPS
hI-IRsEQw7E_11 FIRST AND YOU JUST TAKE A FEW LITTLE FRIENDS THAT AND YOU CAN LEAVE A LITTLE BIT HANGING OUT THE END BECAUSE YOU'LL EVENTUALLY CUT THOSE OFF ANYWAY
hI-IRsEQw7E_12 AND THE SECOND LOOP YOU DON'T RING FLIGHT THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST MOVE IT ISN'T JUST ARE KIND OF CLOSE BY
hI-IRsEQw7E_13 OTHERWISE IT WILL PULL YOUR THREAD ALL THE WAY OUT AGAIN
hI-IRsEQw7E_14 YOU WANT A POOL TAUGHT BUT NOT SO TIGHT THAT IT'S CAN A POOL HER THREAD THROUGH
hI-IRsEQw7E_15 AND THEN GO AHEAD AND CLOSE
hI-IRsEQw7E_16 AND THEN YOUR THIRD LOOP YOU CAN PUT BACK TO THE FIRST ONE
hI-IRsEQw7E_17 THAT'S CAN AT TOTALLY LOCK IN YOUR THREAT SO IT'S NOT IN A GO ANYWHERE
hI-IRsEQw7E_18 AND THEN WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IF THEY ALREADY HAS THE PRESSING MARK THERE YOU JUST CANISTER BY GOING THROUGH A LITTLE TINY BIT OF THE PANTS
hI-IRsEQw7E_19 JUST A FEW LITTLE THREADS AND THEN GO UNDERNEATH THE EDGE OF THAT SEAM BINDING ON THE TURN UP THE EDGE
hI-IRsEQw7E_20 AND THEN JUST CATCH A FEW LITTLE THREADS KIND OF NEAR THAT ON THE PANTS
hI-IRsEQw7E_21 AND THEN GO UNDERNEATH THE THEME SEAM BINDING AND CATCH THE TIP OF THE SEAM BINDING
hI-IRsEQw7E_22 AND I'M SHOWING YOU THE COURSE YOU'D USE MATCHING THREAD SO YOU KNOCK A SEAL THIS
hI-IRsEQw7E_23 AGAIN A FEW LITTLE THREADS
hI-IRsEQw7E_24 IN YOU WANT TO USE JUST A FEW LITTLE THREADS FROM YOUR PANTS SO IT DOESN'T SHOW ON THE OTHER SIDE
hI-IRsEQw7E_25 AND YOU CAN DO THIS AS CLOSE AS YOU WANT DEPENDING ON THE FABRIC
hI-IRsEQw7E_26 SOME FABRIC WON'T MOVE SHIFT SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET CLOSER
hI-IRsEQw7E_27 OTHER FABRIC WON'T BUDGE SO YOU CAN DO IT FURTHER APART
hI-IRsEQw7E_28 BUT ON THE IDEAS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET A NEAT LINE ON YOUR FABRIC THAT DOESN'T SHOW THROUGH
hI-IRsEQw7E_29 SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT FROM THE OTHER SIDE YOU NOT SEEING ANY OF THE STITCHING
hI-IRsEQw7E_30 IT'S PRETTY MUCH INVISIBLE
hI-IRsEQw7E_31 HALF AND THEN WHEN I AND YET I DO THE SAME THREE LITTLE LOOPS
hI-IRsEQw7E_32 YOU CAN EITHER DO IT ON THAT SURFACE OR JUST ROLL BACK THE EDGE AND DO YOUR THREE LITTLE LOOPS ARE DOESN'T SHOW UNDER TURNED UP HIM
hI-IRsEQw7E_33 AND THEN YOU CAN CLIP YOUR THREAD WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED AND THAT'S HOW YOU MEND A HEM

h_6BBJuiz6k_6 THIS IS A SALT WATER OF A REAL FORCE STRIPE FASTBALL SELL THE CORE AND TO ON IT'S NOT THE SORE THING THAT THE BEGINNING AND WE WOULD BE USING BUT THIS IS THE RANGE OF HOW HIGH IT WOULD GO
h_6BBJuiz6k_7 ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM IS A TINY LITTLE REAL WHICH ISN'T MARKED BUT THIS IS AN OLD OF OR THE SEE A FULL REEL AND THIS HAS GOT A ONE WHITE LINE ON IT AND ABOUT THIRTY YARDS OF BACKING
h_6BBJuiz6k_8 SO AND ARRANGE FROM ONE WEIGHT TO TEN WEIGHT OVER HERE YOU HAVE QUITE A A A RANGE OF CHOICES
h_6BBJuiz6k_9 WHAT I RECOMMEND IS A SINGLE ACTION REAL IN IN THE CASE OF EACH OF THESE REELS IT'S A SINGLE ACTION WHICH MEANS THAT FOR EVERY REVOLUTION OF THE SPOOL YOU BRING IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF LINE SO THAT ONE TURN LIKE THIS WILL BRING IN ABOUT NINE INCHES OF FLY LINE

HcPG7m_ZxVU_14 CURRY IS CAN RANGE FROM VERY MILD TO VERY SUBTLE FLAVOR ALL THE WAY UP TO THE KIND THAT USE ONE AND WRAP A GLASS OF ICE WATER THEN IT'S FIERY HOT
HcPG7m_ZxVU_15 INTO MATTER PERSONAL PREFERENCE
HcPG7m_ZxVU_16 MOST OF US ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE MORE SUBTLE CURRIES THE SOFTER CURRIES OF DON'T HAVE A LOT OF PEPPER PRODUCT IN THEM
HcPG7m_ZxVU_17 ANY OF THESE CURRIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE HERE OUT OF YOUR ORIENTAL MARKETS OR YOUR GENERAL GROCERY STORES TEND TO BE THE MEDIUM TO THE MILDER CURRIES

GHYrASBqbOg_2 SO I'VE GOT A F QUARTER INCH ON GUITAR CABLE PLUM AND THIS ONE AS I INSTALLED JACK INTO IT AND TALK ABOUT JACKS NEXT
GHYrASBqbOg_3 THEN ON YOU KNOW I CAN MAKE IS A LOT OF THEM RIGHT NOW
GHYrASBqbOg_4 I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE RIGHT NOW AND HANG HOW HOT HI HAT LOT HIGHER END OF A PATIENT HINGES FROM A CURE SIMPLE AUDIO JACK IN OUT YOUR GUITAR OR TO A AMPLIFIER OR YOUR STEREO OR YOUR RECORDING STUDIO YOU'RE MIXING BOARD WHATEVER IT IS
GHYrASBqbOg_5 SO THE TO TALK ABOUT JACKS A LITTLE BIT
GHYrASBqbOg_6 THERE'S YOUR JUST A FEW DIFFERENT AND JACKS HERE
GHYrASBqbOg_7 BASICALLY YOU THAT QUARTER INCH JACKS LIKE THESE ARE QUARTER AND JACKS IT'S IN DIAMETER OF THE OF THE ERA OF THE M KEVIN PUT THE PLUG THAT HAS AN EVENT
GHYrASBqbOg_8 AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THE EIGHTH INCH JACKS WHICH IS LIKE COME AND MANY JACK LIKE LITTLE MINTER HEADPHONE JACK SETS WITH THESE ARE
GHYrASBqbOg_9 AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE IS LIKE A BANANA PHLEGM JACK WHICH IS HAVE A LITTLE BIT ON THE IT'S A LITTLE BIT SMALLER AMOUNT THE WRONG ON THAT BUT ON THE MAIN SIZES ARE CAN BE EITHER OF QUARTER INJURE EIGHTH INCH SIZE JACKS
GHYrASBqbOg_10 I'M IN EVEN AMONG THOSE JACKS THERE'S DIFFERENCES LIKE IF WE LOOK HERE THIS IS A MANA JACK

GHYrASBqbOg_14 THIS IS HOW HAS THEN
GHYrASBqbOg_15 YOU CAN PLUG IT IN THERE YOU CAN SEE TO SEE THAT CONTACT WAS NEED THERE
GHYrASBqbOg_16 SO THAT'S AN MANA JACK
GHYrASBqbOg_17 BUT IF YOU USE THINGS LIKE A STEREO HEADPHONES YOU MIGHT USE A STEREO JACK AND THIS HAS GOT A TWO CONTACTS ON IT AND THIS ISN'T A STEREO PLUG
GHYrASBqbOg_18 IT ONLY HAS THE ONE ON A CONTACT
GHYrASBqbOg_19 BUT IF YOUR STEREO PLUG IT WOULD HAVE ONE CONTACT HERE IN ONE CONTACT SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THEN SO YOU CAN GET THOSE TWO SIGNALS TO THAT ONE LIFE BUT THIS IS THE ONLY AMANO PLUG
GHYrASBqbOg_20 SO THE MODEL JACK STEREOGRAPHIC RESIN THERE WHICH WILL USE FOR CIRCUIT BENDING FOR THE MOST PART UNITY MAKING MANO INSTRUMENTS NEW CIRCUIT BEND
GHYrASBqbOg_21 ANY AGAIN SHE CAN BRING IT AT TWO STEREO BY DOWN AND THEN MINI JACKS ARE BASICALLY THE SAME THING ENERGY SMALLER

gbvJRSW0RPc_1 IN THIS SEGMENT OF HOW TO CURE YOUR SLICE AND HIT A HOOK WOULD ONLY CONCERN OURSELVES WITH THE CLUB HEAD
gbvJRSW0RPc_2 BECAUSE IT'S THE CLUB HEAD THAT HITS THE BALL IN THE BALL KNOWS ALL IN THE ONLY THING THE BALL KNOWS IS IMPACT AND OUT AND WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT BUT IF YOU CAN WATCH THE CLUB HEAD AT HOME IN PRACTICE WINGS IN YOUR BACKYARD
gbvJRSW0RPc_3 I'M WATCHING THE CLUB HEAD AND I KNOW WHAT I WANT THAT CLUB HEAD TO THE <UNK>
gbvJRSW0RPc_4 BECAUSE IF THERE WAS A BELOW DOWN HERE ON THE GROUND AND I WANTED TO SPIN THAT LOW IF LIKE THAT THAT CLUB HEAD AND IS WATCHING THE CLUB THAT IF I BROUGHT THAT CLUB HEAD INSIDE AND SWUNG THAT CLUB HEAD OUT AND BEFORE I GOT TO THAT GLOBE I RELEASED OR TURNED OVER OR FLIP THAT OVER
gbvJRSW0RPc_5 INSIDE THAT OVER
gbvJRSW0RPc_6 WITH THAT LOPE THE HEEL TOE
gbvJRSW0RPc_7 THAT IS GOING TO SPIN THAT GLOW
gbvJRSW0RPc_8 SO AS A DRILL WATCH THE CLUB HEAD
gbvJRSW0RPc_9 YOU COULD EVEN DRAW A LINE ON THE GROUND
gbvJRSW0RPc_10 YOU COULD WE'RE LINE ON THE GROUND THAT ISN'T STRAIGHT BUT OUT TO THE RIGHT
gbvJRSW0RPc_11 IT CAN CAN EVEN PUT A SHAFT THERE
gbvJRSW0RPc_12 PUT ONE STRAIGHT AND PUT ONE OUT TO THE RIGHT AND SWING OUT TO RIGHT INSIDE OUT AND TURN IT OVER
gbvJRSW0RPc_13 WATCH HECLA THAT
gbvJRSW0RPc_14 INSIDE OUT AND TURN IT OVER
gbvJRSW0RPc_15 DO IT SLOWLY
gbvJRSW0RPc_16 DO WOULD OFTEN AND YOUR GOING TO LEARN THE FUNDAMENTAL MOVES TO HIT A HOOK
GVU1bHfi6lE_1 SO LET'S DO WITH A BACKGROUND LIT MORE
GVU1bHfi6lE_2 WE'VE GOT THAT SHADOW
GVU1bHfi6lE_3 I DON'T LIKE THAT SHADOW OF
GVU1bHfi6lE_4 OR AT LEAST CERTAINLY NOT THAT STRONG
GVU1bHfi6lE_5 I CAN SOFTEN IT BY DIFFUSING THIS OFF WITH A DIFFUSION PANEL
GVU1bHfi6lE_6 BUT THAT TAKES AWAY THE MAGIC FALL OFF FOOD THE FREE
GVU1bHfi6lE_7 HELLO MY FRYING GET RID OF THAT THAT SHADOW IN ANOTHER WAY
GVU1bHfi6lE_8 PART OF IT IS OUT OF MY FRAME IN THE CAMERA
GVU1bHfi6lE_9 BUT I THINK THAT I CAN GET RID OF IT BY ADDING SOME LIGHT BACK IN THERE
GVU1bHfi6lE_10 WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN WE TURN THIS LIGHT DACRON IS IT'S GONNA MAKE THAT SHADOW LESS NOTICEABLE
GVU1bHfi6lE_11 SO WE'RE GONNA ADD ANOTHER LIGHT
GVU1bHfi6lE_12 LET'S ADD ANOTHER LIGHT JUST TO DEAL WITH THE BACKGROUND
GVU1bHfi6lE_13 SO BE A BACKGROUND LIGHT
GVU1bHfi6lE_14 SO I'VE GOT ANOTHER LAMP HERE
GVU1bHfi6lE_15 AND I'M A PUSH PULL IT OVER INTO THIS POSITION HERE WHERE THE SHADOW IS THE STRONGEST
GVU1bHfi6lE_16 AND LET'S DIRECTIVE ACT THAT SHADOW OR AND BRING IT UP
GVU1bHfi6lE_17 NOTICE THAT THE SHADOW IS DISAPPEARING AS THIS LIGHT COMES ON AND IS DIRECTED AT THAT SHADOW LOCATION
GVU1bHfi6lE_18 A LITTLE HARD TO SEE WHETHER IT'S ENOUGH FOR HALF ON AND THAT WILL DEPEND UPON THE EXPOSURE THAT I PUT IN THE CAMERA
GVU1bHfi6lE_19 PUT THAT HAS A <UNK> AS FAR AS THE CAMERAS CONCERN THAT MAIN DARK SHADOW IS NOW INVISIBLE
GyujcYMIqV0_1 ONE TALK ABOUT ADVANCE FORWARD STROKE NOW FOR KAYAKING
GyujcYMIqV0_2 IN THE EARLIER LESSON IN BEGINNING FORWARD STROKE WE WOULD TALK ABOUT JUST USING YOUR ARMS TO LEAN AND PUSHING THE PADDLE WITH ROCKS
GyujcYMIqV0_3 NOW IF YOU'RE KAYAKING YOU ACTUALLY ONE OF ROTATE YOUR BODY INSTEAD OF USING YOUR ARMS
GyujcYMIqV0_4 MY TORSO THE MUSCLES ALOT LARGER AND STRONGER THAN IN MY ARMS SO I WILL USE MY TORSO MUSCLES IS CENTER CORE MUSCLES AND MY BODY TO PROPEL MY KAYAK DOWN THE RIVER
GyujcYMIqV0_5 SO FIRST THING IF I PUT THE KAYAK IT LATER ON TOP OF MY HEAD AND I JUST ROTATE LIKE THIS C ALLUM ACTUALLY USING MY STOMACH MUSCLES TO BRING THE WAY BACK AND FORTH
GyujcYMIqV0_6 UNLIKE THE ENERGIZER BUNNY YOU'RE JUST ROTATING LIKE THIS
GyujcYMIqV0_7 SO LET ME SHOW YOU ON THE GROUND WHAT THAT'LL DO
GyujcYMIqV0_8 SO I GO AHEAD AND SIT DOWN AND LIKE I ACT LIKE I'M SITTING IN THE BOAT BEND MY KNEES ARE SLIGHTLY BENT
GyujcYMIqV0_9 WHAT I WANT TO DO INSTEAD OF JUST PULLING AND PUSHING WITH MY ARMS WHEN I LEACH FOR AND SEE HOW MY WHOLE BODY ROTATES FORWARD LIKE THIS
GyujcYMIqV0_10 AND THEN A PLANT THE KAYAK PADDLE IN THE WATER IN AN OBLONG ROTATE MY ENTIRE BODY BACK LIKE THIS
GyujcYMIqV0_11 I LIFT THAT'LL AGAIN I PLANT FRONT LAID IN WATER LITTLE NOTATE MY ENTIRE BODY BACK
GyujcYMIqV0_12 SEE HOW I'M USING MY STOMACH MUSCLES THE PADDLE RATHER THAN MY ARMS
GyujcYMIqV0_13 SO ONE OF THE WAYS YOU CAN DO THAT IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE TRICKS THE END OF THE PADDLE THAT'S IN THE WATER IS CALLED THE BUSINESS END OF THE PADDLE
GyujcYMIqV0_14 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO A PLANT THAT AND THE PADDLE IN THE WATER AND THE LOCK MIGHT HAVE NECK IN MY HEAD ON MY SHOULDERS SO WHEN MY NECK MOVES THE WATCH THAT PADDLE BLADE MY WHOLE BODY IS CAN MOVE
GyujcYMIqV0_15 SO SEE OUR UNLOCKED
GyujcYMIqV0_16 I ROTATE LIKE THIS
GyujcYMIqV0_17 SEE HOW I'M LOOKING BACK ABOUT PADDLE THE WHOLE TIME IT FORCES MY BODY ROTATE
GyujcYMIqV0_18 SAME THING HERE
GyujcYMIqV0_19 AND THEN A PLANT THE BUSINESS AND OF THE PADDLE IN THE WATER ON THAT AND ROTATE BACKWARDS AND WATCH THAT PADDLE BLADE
GyujcYMIqV0_20 AGAIN THAT FORCES MY BODY AND ROTATE WITH THE PADDLE
GyujcYMIqV0_21 AND THAT WAY I'M USING THE CORE MUSCLES IN MY BODY TO DO THE PADDLING
GyujcYMIqV0_22 THIS WAY IF I DO TWENTY MILES AND I GET THE ON MY STOMACH MUSCLES SHOULD HURT BUT MY ARM MUSCLES WILL BE FINE
GyujcYMIqV0_23 HEY I'M THING
GyujcYMIqV0_24 A ONE
GyujcYMIqV0_25 ONE
GyujcYMIqV0_26 OR IF THE E F AND KNIFE PART OFF I THOUGHT HALF
gEoJ_Jf47eA_1 WHEN UNDERSTANDING BUS IN THE FIRST THING OF THEM STAND IS THAT EVERY TIME YOU CREATE A BOSS IT'S SENDING A SIGNAL TO ANOTHER TRACK THAT YOU CREATE
gEoJ_Jf47eA_2 SO WHEN I LOOK AT MY MY CHANNEL STRIP I WOULD GET MY SENDS AN EYE SIGN ASCEND TOOL BOSS
gEoJ_Jf47eA_3 I'M AN SHOES BUS ONE
gEoJ_Jf47eA_4 WHAT HAPPENED IS A CAN CREATE AN AUXILIARY TRACK
gEoJ_Jf47eA_5 THIS IS ANOTHER TRACK THAT THE SINGLES AND GO THROUGH
gEoJ_Jf47eA_6 SO MY PLATE TO THIS FIRST ONE I HIT PLAY IT'S ALSO AND PLAYING HERE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH ACTION BUS IT
gEoJ_Jf47eA_7 I THINK SHOULDER LEVEL THAT'S BUST OUT WITH WITH HIS DIAL RIGHT HERE
gEoJ_Jf47eA_8 IT'S ACTUALLY WILL CONTROLS THE LINE
gEoJ_Jf47eA_9 AND THE CLAY INNING SLOWLY BRING IT UP
gEoJ_Jf47eA_10 TO THAT SIDE THE BASIC CONCEPT OF BUSING
gEoJ_Jf47eA_11 THIS ALLOWS YOU TO DO CERTAIN THINGS LIKE BRAIN A BLUNT ATTACKS TOGETHER SEEK INFECTED LOT ONE SEE I'M SAYING
gEoJ_Jf47eA_12 YOU CAN ALSO DO CERTAIN THINGS LIKE PUT REVERBS EFFECTS SUCH AS A DELAY IS AN EIGHTH OF AN MODULATION
GJnyiJZpwFc_1 IN THIS EXERCISE WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS IN ON THE HAMSTRING THE BACK PART OF THE FIVE BICEP TOUCH OF YOU'VE MADE
GJnyiJZpwFc_2 I'VE BEEN AND YOUR PARTNER ONCE MY PARTNER TO FLEX THE FOOT AND YOU'RE GOING TO PUT YOUR HAND ON THE MEATY PART OF THE CALF MUSCLE AS THEY FLEX UP AND USE RIGHT THERE THAT ONE OF ATTACHMENT HAMSTRING AND RELEASE
GJnyiJZpwFc_3 I CAN ALSO IF YOUR PARTNER HAS SHOES ON WITH YOUR HAND ON THE HEEL RESIST UP JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT PUSHING THE ANKLE JOINT OUT OF LINE AND RELEASE DOWN
GJnyiJZpwFc_4 SO EITHER ON THE MEATY PART OF THE CALF AND COMING OUT APPLYING RESISTANCE OTHER ACTIVATING AT BACK PART OF THE THIGH AND RELEASE WE'RE HERE ON THE HEEL COMING UP
GJnyiJZpwFc_5 HAMSTRING CURL IN A PRONE POSITION WORKING EIGHT TO TEN REPS FOR BEGINNERS TEN TWELVE AND UP ONE TO THREE SETH

GyUoVVz0nEY_5 NORMALLY WOMEN ARE NOW ON CLEANER IT YOU SHOW THE IN THIS BIT OF A LIVE A
GyUoVVz0nEY_6 DOES JEANS ONE IN A MINUTE NINE LONG MAGMA THIN

gsNEiNEnHV4_1 SO NOW AREN'T GOING TO GO INTO YOUR ESPRESSO GRINDERS TO USE TO GRINDER BEANS
gsNEiNEnHV4_2 READY I HAVE ONE EXAMPLE OF A HOME ESPRESSO GRINDER HER AND HOW IT WORKS IS YOU HAVE YOUR HOPPER HERE WHERE YOU THROUGH BEANS INTO
gsNEiNEnHV4_3 DROP DOWN INTO THE AREA WHERE EXACTLY GROUND
gsNEiNEnHV4_4 SPADES IT OUT INTO THE DOSING CHAMBER HERE
gsNEiNEnHV4_5 ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE OCEAN CHAMBER I HAVE TO LEVER TO PULL THE COFFEE OUT OF THE DOSING CHAMBER
gsNEiNEnHV4_6 HAVE A REST HERE THE RIGHT LEG WRONG BE RESTING PORTER FILTER THEIR <UNK> GOES COFFEE INTO THE PORTA FILTER BASKET
gsNEiNEnHV4_7 AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE UP OVER HAIRS LAW HADN'T TRICKS FOR TURNED ON THESE LESSON GRINDER
gsNEiNEnHV4_8 ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS THAT AFFECTS THE ESPRESSO SHOTS IS THE COARSENESS OF THE GROUND AND THAT AFFECTS THE TIME OF THE SHOTS ON THIS ESPRESSO GRINDER AS MARKED HERE ON THE GRINDER OUT
gsNEiNEnHV4_9 YOU TURN THIS CALL IT YOU DON'T ASSUME METAL COLOR COUNTER CLOCKWISE TO RUN THE COFFEE MORE FINE AND CLOCKWISE TO GRIND IT MORE COLORS
gsNEiNEnHV4_10 WERE TO DO IN THERE IS THE FINER THE COFFEE IS GROUND THE MORE RESISTANCE THEN IT'S CREATING FROM WATER IN IT PASSES THROUGH DURING THE EXTRACTION PROCESS OF THESE THIS A SHOTS
gsNEiNEnHV4_11 IF YOU'RE <UNK> I'VE COFFEE IS GROUND COARSER THAN THAT DON'T LESS RESISTANCE THE WATER HAS THE FASTER YOU ASKED MESSAGE ACID IN AND TAKE AN ISLAND THE LAST TIME IN AND TAKE A BLUE SHOT
gsNEiNEnHV4_12 THE FINER THE COFFEE IS THE LONGER THE ITEM THAT WIRES IN AND TAKE TWO PASSES COFFEE <UNK> IN THIS POSITION
gsNEiNEnHV4_13 SO IF YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT LOOK LIKE A SMALLER AT HOME GRINDER LIKE THIS AND HIM BASICALLY IT IS IS THE OF THE OUT THERE'S LOTS OF THESE AND THE TOP ON IT BEGIN GRINDING HIT THAT GRINDING THE BEES
gsNEiNEnHV4_14 THE ONLY WAY TO CONTROL COFFEE COARSENESS THEIR GRIND COARSENESS ON A GRINDER LIKE THIS IS BY TIME OF THE ROOM
gsNEiNEnHV4_15 SO BASICALLY ESPRESSO GRINDS OR JUST A WHOLE LOT FINER THEN YOU'RE DRIP COFFEE AND ONE GUIDELINES AGO WISE KNITTING BRINING ABOUT TWENTY SECONDS WITH A GRINDER LIKE THIS
gsNEiNEnHV4_16 IT IS GONNA ADD GRIND INTO A LITTLE IS LONGER THAN HOME DRIP COFFEE IN A COPY OF FOUR

G7zu6UH0QoM_1 THE NEXT THING I'M TALKING ABOUT IS YOUR ESPRESSO GRINDERS
G7zu6UH0QoM_2 AND SO IF WE HAVE AN S A HOME ESPRESSO GRINDER LIKE THIS ON HIM TO ALLOW THE OF THE HOPPER FOR THE COFFEE GOES INTO IT FEEDS INTO WHERE THE COFFEE IS GROUND SPITS IT INTO THE DOSING CHAMBER
G7zu6UH0QoM_3 THE RIGHT HAND SIDE WE HAVE THE LEVER THE CONTROL TO FLEA AT DOESN'T CHAMBER AND THE SWITCH TO TURN IT ON
G7zu6UH0QoM_4 THE IT YOU HAVE A REST DOWN HERE TO REST THE PORTER FILTER ON WIDER DOESN'T TIME INTO THE PORTER FILTER BACK OUT
G7zu6UH0QoM_5 ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT GOES INTO THE ESPRESSO PREPARATION PROCESS IS THE COARSENESS OF THE GRINDS THAT YOU USING FOR THE ESPRESSO SHOTS
G7zu6UH0QoM_6 AUTOCRATIC THIS HIGH E CONTROL THAT IS AS MARKED HERE ON THE GRINDER COUNTERCLOCKWISE GRIND THE COFFEE FINER AND CLOCKWISE GRUNTS ACCOUNT AND THE COFFEE COARSER
G7zu6UH0QoM_7 WHEN YOU'RE GRINDING THE COFFEE FINER IT'S CREATING MORE RESISTANCE FOR THE WATER WHEN IT'S PASSING THROUGH AND EXTRACTING A COFFEE FOR THE SHOT OF ESPRESSO
G7zu6UH0QoM_8 ON A FEW CREATING MORE RESISTANCE IN THE SHOT IS IN A POOL SLOWER TAKE LONGER TO PULL THE COURSE OF THE COFFEE IS THE IN THAT NONE THE LESS RESISTANCE THAT THE WATER HATS AND THE QUICKER THE SHOTS IN THE POOL
G7zu6UH0QoM_9 IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THE SMALLER HOME BLADE GRINDERS ON THAT YOU USE IN TUNE GRINDER COFFEE FOR YEARS RUSSOW THEN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PUT THE COFFEE IN THERE LIKE NORMAL AND WHEN YOU HIT THE BUTTON TO START GRINDING THE COFFEE THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU HAVE TO CONTROL AROUND HOW FINER GRINDING THE COFFEE IS BY THE WING FROM TYPE LINK OF TIME THAT YOU GRIND THE COFFEE ON
G7zu6UH0QoM_10 FIRST RUSSOW OR WARM GUIDELINE TO GO BUYS IT'S TWENTY SECONDS OR MORE ON THAT YOU CAN KEEP THE GRINDER ON TO GRIND THE COFFEE
G7zu6UH0QoM_11 IT'S GOOD HEAVY CONSIDERABLY FINER THAN A NORMAL CUP OF COFFEE
GIkXnMUo4wQ_1 ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE LEAVE THE SKIN LOCUST SOUTHIN HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT CRAFTING WITH FULL AND STUFF
GIkXnMUo4wQ_2 COLOR IN YOUR TOWARDS OKAY THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO COLORED WORDS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_3 AND SOME OF THINGS YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT FIRST ENDS ON WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO PAINT YOUR INSIDE YOUR DESIGN FIRST OR WHETHER YOU ARE GOING TO DO THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOARD OR HOW MUCH IS GONNA BE THE AND NATURAL GORDER SHOWING
GIkXnMUo4wQ_4 BUT SOME OF THE THINGS YOU CAN USE ON IT TO DO THIS ON THIS PARTICULAR GOURD HAS BEEN ON DEAD GORGETS OFF A STAINED WITH LEATHER DIETS ON THE COLORING HERE THAT YOU SEE HAS BEEN DONE WITH ACRYLIC JUST YOUR BASIC ACRYLIC PAINTS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_5 YOU CAN ALSO USE ON OUT WHEN STREAMS WOULD STAINS WORK VERY WELL FOR DO AN OVERALL AWARD
GIkXnMUo4wQ_6 YOU CAN ALSO USED ON THE SHOE POLISH WORKS VERY WELL KNOWN TO GET A NICE SHINE AHMANSON COLORING ON ITS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_7 OR YOUR DESIGNS AND SOME OF THE FINER WORK YOU CAN USE ON SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A PERMANENT ON MAGIC MARKER
GIkXnMUo4wQ_8 YOU CAN ALSO HAVE TO USE ON WHAT THEY HAVE OUT ON THE MARKET NOW THEY'RE CALLED PAINT TURNS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_9 THINK AND WORK REALLY WELL ON
GIkXnMUo4wQ_10 THERE'S ALSO THE DICE THAT YOU USE FOR A RUBBER STAMP BEAN THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT GUYS OUT THERE FOR THAT THAT WORK
GIkXnMUo4wQ_11 AND A NIGHT THERE'S ALSO FABRIC DICE THEY DON'T WORK REAL WELL THAT YOU CAN AGAIN EXPERIMENT WITH ON ANY OF THESE
GIkXnMUo4wQ_12 THE BEST THING TO DO IF YOU GO TO LIKE A GOURD FARM INVITED BOARDS THEY ALMOST ALWAYS WILL GIVE YOU THE OF BROKEN MEN OBJECTS IN PIECES OF THE GOURD
GIkXnMUo4wQ_13 OR THE OR IS GOOD TO PICK OUT BECAUSE YOU CAN USE THOSE AS YOUR PRACTICE PIECES SEE SEE HOW YOUR COLOR IS GOING TO LOOK HOW OLD THE THAT I'VE GUY IS GOING TO WORK WITH YOUR ACRYLICS AND HOW THE INTERACTS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_14 ON AND AGAIN YEARS YOU SHADING AND IS IT CAN BE THE COLOR THAT YOU WANT ISN'T TOO DARK ISN'T TOO LIGHT
GIkXnMUo4wQ_15 SOMETHING ELSE TO KEEP IN MIND WITH YOUR LEATHER DYES THE LEATHER GUYS WILL FADE OVER TIME
GIkXnMUo4wQ_16 THAT A COUPLE OF THINGS OUT YOU CAN DO TO TRY TO PREVENT THAT ONE BEING DO YOUR UP ACRYLIC SEALANT ONE TWO PROJECTS DON
GIkXnMUo4wQ_17 BUT THEY THEY STILL EVEN WITH THAT THE LEATHER GUYS WILL TEND TO FADE OVER TIME
GIkXnMUo4wQ_18 ON THE WOOD STAINS THE LAST A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND BE ON THAT AUDIT GOT SOME A PRODUCT OUT THERE NOW CALLED A WORD ON A BOARD INK DRY THAT PALM IS MORE COLOR FAST
GIkXnMUo4wQ_19 SO YOU CAN AGAIN GO VERY VERY SIMPLE WITH YOUR JUST BASIC ACRYLIC PAINTS AND MAGIC MARKERS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_20 WHETHER THE ICE THESE COME ABOUT WORE FOR FIFTY A BOTTLE LOTS OF DIFFERENT COLORS
GIkXnMUo4wQ_21 WOODS CHANGE MY NEXT AND HAVE THEM IN AROUND THE HOUSE ARMS TO POLISH MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE LINE AROUND HOW CELL WANTED DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO ACTUALLY GET AND SOME COLOR ON BOARD
HBbFaTK359U_1 IT'S MOVING IS A PROCESS WHERE AFTER YOU HAVE QUANTIZE SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE WILL GAPS IN BETWEEN AUDIO FILES AND GET LITTLE SPACES BETWEEN REGIONS
HBbFaTK359U_2 SO WHAT I DID SMOOTHING DOES IT IMPLIES CROSS AIDS IN BETWEEN EACH OF THOSE JUST ALLOW FOR CERTAIN TRANSITIONS EXISTING A BETTER SOUND ALTOGETHER
HBbFaTK359U_3 SO WITH AND IT'S MOVING AS SOON AS LONG AS I'VE CONFORM THE MY REGIONS MAY SHAVINGS QUANTIZE THE WAY I WANTED NOT CAN CHOOSE AND IT'S MOVING AND FILL THE GAPS ARE TO FILL THE GAPS WITH CROSS FADE
HBbFaTK359U_4 SO DO THEM FOLDER GAFF ACROSS FACING THAT FIVE MILLISECONDS THEN SMOOTHLY
HBbFaTK359U_5 WHAT THIS DOES IS CAN WE SPOOL IN MY WHOLE TRACK UP SO THAT ALL THE GAPS ARE SEAMLESS AND THERE'S NO REAL TYPE OF OUT BREAKS OR ANY TYPE OF LIKE IT'S LIKE PAUSES WITH IN THAT WITHIN TRACK
HBbFaTK359U_6 GET A SHOULD THAT WHEN YOU DO THIS AS WELL LIGHT IS THAT THE GAPS AND THE GAPS SOME HOME MIGHT NOT SOUND EXACTLY ONE IN
HBbFaTK359U_7 SO WHEN YOU DO YET MACHETE LISTEN TO IMMEDIATELY AFTER JUST MAKE SURE THAT IT'S RIGHT AND SOUNDS WITH THE ONE IT
gNEk8QqEOY0_1 I'M LES WHITLEY
gNEk8QqEOY0_2 YOU GET A TALKING LITTER BOX HOLDING THE INNER THIGHS
gNEk8QqEOY0_3 THE FIRST THING I LIKE TO ADDRESSES SPECIFICALLY ISOLATING ASPECTS OR ANGLES OF THE MUSCLE ON ESPECIALLY THE LOWER BODY
gNEk8QqEOY0_4 THE TONE THE INNER THIGH WE'RE TALKING BOTTOM ALSO IT'S TYPICALLY NOT MUCH BIGGER THAN THE SIZE OF YOUR AROUND MY FINGER
gNEk8QqEOY0_5 ON THE MOST OF THE INNER VISOR PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE WORK BRINGING THE LEG INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE BODY WE'RE ABDUCTION AND ADDING TO THE INSIDE
gNEk8QqEOY0_6 SO TYPICALLY YOU MAY SEE SOMEONE LINE ON THEIR SIDE DOING INSIDE LEG RAISES OR MACHINE THE TRAIN THAT MUSCLE
gNEk8QqEOY0_7 AGAIN THAT MUSCLE BE ONE IS IS VERY SMALL
gNEk8QqEOY0_8 SO THE OVER TRADER TRADE IT TO MAKE IT STRONG WILL TAKE A LOT OF EFFORT
gNEk8QqEOY0_9 NOW OVERALL TYPICALLY RESPONSIVE TONING THIGHS IS TO GIVE THEM WHERE MOST OF APPEARANCE REMOVING THE BODY FAT
gNEk8QqEOY0_10 THAT REQUIRES PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO BURN CALORIES RICHMOND CALORIES AS WELL AS MODIFYING DIETARY INTO
gNEk8QqEOY0_11 ONE EXERCISE FOR TRAIN THE OVERALL MOSTLY JUNE LEGS NOT ONLY THE INNER THIGH THE OUTER THIGH FOR THE FIVE BACK ADVISABLE THE HIPS IS THE SQUAT
gNEk8QqEOY0_12 THE BASIC SQUAT WILL BEGIN BY DRESSING THE BAR A IT EVEN STEPPING UNDERNEATH BALANCING THE WAY ACROSS THE UPPER PART OF BACK MORE PART THE SHOULDERS
gNEk8QqEOY0_13 THINKING THE ARRANGED IN A VARIETY OF POSITIONS
gNEk8QqEOY0_14 TOES FORTY OUT WILL SLIGHTLY EMPHASIZE MORE OR THE INNER ASPECT OF THE FIVE
gNEk8QqEOY0_15 THIS COMMONLY REFERRED TO ADVANCING IF WE A SQUAT
gNEk8QqEOY0_16 THESE WILL FOLLOW THE SAME DIRECTION THE TOES AS YOU LOWER YOURSELF DOWN UNDER GOOD CONTROL
gNEk8QqEOY0_17 TRY TO MAKE AN UP RIGHTS FIND POSITION
gNEk8QqEOY0_18 TOES POINTED STRAIGHT AHEAD WORK MORE HOTTER ASPECTS OF THE FILES THAT HAVE THE SIZE OF THAT WITH THE INNER
gNEk8QqEOY0_19 WORKING ON RANGE OF MOTION TOES FORWARD SLIGHTLY OUT KNEES FALLING SAME DIRECTION
gNEk8QqEOY0_20 YOU CONTROL MOTION
gNEk8QqEOY0_21 ALL THE WAY UP ALL WITH THEM
gNEk8QqEOY0_22 ALWAYS SEARCH RACK THE BAR UNDER CONTROL
gNEk8QqEOY0_23 WHICH ARE IN THE LEG IS A WHOLE NOT EMPHASIZING ANY ONE PARTICULAR PART AND LOOKING FOR BALANCE OVERALL SHAPE AS WELL AS MOST LAYERED YOU LIGHT OR HAVING A NICELY LOOK AS WELL
GFasV9Lpgv0_1 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IN THE PORCELAIN PAINTING ANOTHER TOOL THAT WE USE CALLED A WHITE OUT TOO
GFasV9Lpgv0_2 AND YOU HAVE ON HARDER WHITEOUT TOOLS LIKE THIS AND YOU HAVE SOFTER ONES LIKE THIS
GFasV9Lpgv0_3 IT A LITTLE MORE CONTROL OF THE HEART ONES BUT ALL OF THEM HAVE THEIR USE
GFasV9Lpgv0_4 THIS ONE HAS THE WEDGED POINT VERY VERY SOFT
GFasV9Lpgv0_5 THIS ONE HAS THE HARDER SHARP POINT
GFasV9Lpgv0_6 AND THIS ONE AND THIS ONE AND VERY SIMILAR EXCEPT THE BLUE IS MUCH FIRMER THEN THIS ONE
GFasV9Lpgv0_7 SO YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THE DIFFERENCE THERE
GFasV9Lpgv0_8 AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE SOME THEY'RE LIKE A FULL RUBBER
GFasV9Lpgv0_9 AND YOU CAN DO A DIFFERENT TECHNIQUE WITH THAT
GFasV9Lpgv0_10 SO I'LL SHOW YOU QUICKLY HOW WE USE THE WHITEOUT TOOLS
GFasV9Lpgv0_11 FOR INSTANCE ON THIS TO SHAPE FLOWER PETALS IF WE'RE LEAVES <UNK> AND YOU CAN ALSO MAKE DESIGNS LIKE THIS
GFasV9Lpgv0_12 AND THEN YOU COME BACK WITH YOUR BRASH IN HE STARTED FAT IN YOU CAN WHITE OUT LIKE THAT
GFasV9Lpgv0_13 IT CAN GIVE YOU A NICE CLEAR EDGE TO START WITH
GFasV9Lpgv0_14 THE THING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT PORCELAIN PAINTING IS IT IS SIMILAR TO WATERCOLOR PAINTING
GFasV9Lpgv0_15 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE HIGHLIGHTS THAT YOU WANT IN BEFORE YOU FIRE BECAUSE YOU CAN NOT GET THEM BACK
GFasV9Lpgv0_16 SO GENERALLY ON THE FIRST FIRE YOU CONCENTRATE ON GETTING THE SHAPE OF YOUR PAINTING AN <UNK> AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO HAVE ALL THE HIGHLIGHTS WHERE YOU WANT HIM A AND B LIGHTNESS THAT YOU WANT HIM BECAUSE YOU CANNOT GO BACK AND AND PAINT ON TOP TO LIGHTEN LIKE YOU DO WITH OIL PAINT OR ACRYLIC PAINT
GFasV9Lpgv0_17 SO IT'S JUST ALMOST REVERSED FROM ANY TYPE OF WELL PAINTING YOU MAY HAVE EVER DONE
GFasV9Lpgv0_18 AND THAT'S WHICH YOU USE THE WHITE OUT TOOLS AND SHOW YOU HOW TO BLEND THIS
GFasV9Lpgv0_19 AND THE SYNTHETIC BRUSHES TO CREATE THESE
GFasV9Lpgv0_20 THAT GIVES YOU AN EXAMPLE
GFasV9Lpgv0_21 ANOTHER THING THAT WE CAN USE AS WHITEOUT TOOL UP TOP IS SO
GFasV9Lpgv0_22 THIS LOOKS REALLY PET BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF PAINT ON IT BUT IT'S STILL WORKS GREAT
GFasV9Lpgv0_23 AND YOU CAN USE IT WRAPPED AROUND YOUR FINGER OR A REAL SHARP WIPE OUT LIKE THIS
GFasV9Lpgv0_24 WE ALSO USE THE POLY FILL
GFasV9Lpgv0_25 WITH WHAT USED IN PILLOWS YOU JUST GET IT IN ANY SEWING SHOP OR CRASH SHOPS
GFasV9Lpgv0_26 YOU WRAP IT IN THE SAIL LIKE THIS AND YOU CAN USE IT TO CLEAN AROUND YOUR PAINTING
GFasV9Lpgv0_27 IT CAN ALSO USE IT FOR WHITE OUTS TO CREATE THINGS THAT YOU WANT IN A DIFFERENT MANNER
GFasV9Lpgv0_28 SO IT'S ANOTHER VERY GOOD TOOL
GFasV9Lpgv0_29 AND USUALLY WHEN WE ARE FINISHED WITH A PAINTING WE WILL GO AROUND AND CLEAN UP ALL THE EXCESS PAINT AROUND IT BECAUSE IT ONCE IF PAINTS THERE IT'S CAN BE FIRED IN A GLAZE
GFasV9Lpgv0_30 AND SO THAT IS SOME OF THE WHITE OUT TOOLS THAT WE USE
gJK0LpbTbEE_1 MY NAME IS ANTHONY METAL THEM ANY ANIMAL TO BE TALKING ABOUT NIGHT TIME PHOTOGRAPHY LIGHTING EFFECTS
gJK0LpbTbEE_2 A NIGHT TIME PHOTOGRAPHY CAN BE VERY INTERESTING WITH THE SKY LINES OF THE CITIES <UNK> AND ONE THING I JUST LIKE TO DO IS THAT I WOULD GO OVER AND NOT GET ON TOP OF A HIGH BUILDING MAYBE PHOTOGRAPHING OF CERTAIN CITY
gJK0LpbTbEE_3 AND ONE THING ABOUT NIGHTTIME PHOTOGRAPHY IS IT'S LOW LIGHT SO THE SHUTTER SPEED THOSE USING MIGHT BE VERY SLOW
gJK0LpbTbEE_4 SO STRING OF CORE IS MOVING ALONG SIDE THE HIGHWAY CAN ACTUALLY LOOK JUST LIKE ONE BIG BLUR OF LIGHT COMING ALONG
gJK0LpbTbEE_5 AND THAT'S ONE EFFECT OF NIGHT TIME PHOTOGRAPHY THAT YOU CAN UTILIZE TO YOUR ADVANTAGE TO ME STITCHED REMUAGE IF INTERESTING PICTURE
gJK0LpbTbEE_6 BY LEAVING THE SHUTTER OPEN IN ANY KIND OF MOVING LIGHT IS REALLY DISCONNECT CAPTURE ONTO YOUR IN EACH LIKE THAN A CERTAIN WAY
gJK0LpbTbEE_7 IN THE ON OFTEN DOES THAT TOO
gJK0LpbTbEE_8 WHEN A PHOTOGRAPH SOMETIMES IN BARS OR AN RESTAURANTS FROM PHOTOGRAPHING IF YOU ACTUALLY SEE THE COLOR OF THE KNEE ON BEHIND MY SUBJECTS'
gJK0LpbTbEE_9 I ALWAYS LIKE TO USE THAT EFFECT ALSO
gJK0LpbTbEE_10 ONE THING ABOUT NIGHT TIME PHOTOGRAPHY TO THE I ALWAYS THINK IS A REALLY FUN THING TO PLAY WITH SOMETIMES IF IS TURN THE LIGHTS OFTEN A ROOM AND LEAVE YOUR SHUTTER OPEN ON YOUR CAMERA
gJK0LpbTbEE_11 AND YOU CAN MAYBE HAVE A FRIEND OR WHOEVER YOU'RE TAKING PICTURES OF ACTUALLY TRACE THE OUTLINE OF THEMSELVES WITH A SMALL PEN LIE
gJK0LpbTbEE_12 AND THEN IF YOU CLOSE THE SHUTTER YOU'LL ACTUALLY SEE THE IMAGE OF THAT PERSON ON YOUR HAMMER
gJK0LpbTbEE_13 IT'S A REALLY FUN TRICK TO PLAY WITH DIGITAL CAMERAS WITH KIDS
gJK0LpbTbEE_14 SELECT EXPLAIN PHOTOGRAPHY LIKE THAT PEOPLE'S AND
gJK0LpbTbEE_15 AND THOSE ARE SOME INTERESTING NIGHT TIME EFFECTS THAT YOU CAN USE THE COUNTRY
GkoeDMrq0Kw_1 OKAY NOW ON THE IN WHITE FOR THE REST THE EYE
GkoeDMrq0Kw_2 SO TO CLEAN A BRUSH A STICK THE BRUSH NOT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM HOW TO STICK IT IN THERE

Gqq6FwTV-Nw_4 ON ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO USE A SPEND VALLEY DECK IS TO FORCE CARDS
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_5 NOW I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO LEARN SOME METHODS OF FORCING CARDS THAT USE A REGULAR DECK
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_6 SOME VARIAL AFTER PERFORM FOR SOMEBODY ONE OF THE STRING IN YOUR POCKET
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_7 KNOWING HOW TO WILL FORCE CARDS IS HANDY BOUGHT IN IT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS CAN HAVE THE SAME SELECTED CARD BECAUSE OF THE WITH THE DECK WORKS YOU CAN BUT THIS IS AT ANY TRICK THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THAT USES A FORCED CARD IN ANY OF THE OTHER SEGMENTS YOU CAN USE THIS FOR
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_8 THIS IS ANOTHER METHOD OF FORCING NO MATTER HOW THEY HAVE THE CARD SELECTED
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_9 YOU CAN EVEN DO THIS
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_10 YOU COULD PUT THE DECK RIGHT ON THE TABLE TELL THEM OKAY JUST CUT THE DECK <UNK> AND WILL USE THE CARD THAT YOU CUT TWO AS OUR SELECTED CARD
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_11 ANY OF THOSE METHODS THAT YOU CAN USE FOR HAVING A CARD SELECTED FROM SPAIN VALLEY DECK WILL ALSO FUNCTION AS A FORCE
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_12 IF YOU GO BACK AND WATCH AND THE FORCING TRICKS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_13 AND SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF OTHER APPLICATIONS HERE AS WELL
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_14 THEY WILL CERTAINLY FIT THE BILL BECAUSE THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A PERFECT WITH FORCE THE CAR
Gqq6FwTV-Nw_15 PRACTICE WITH THIS PRACTICE RATHER CARD FORCES AS WELL AND WHERE SHE'S MORE TRICKS
HGblCWBdQeA_1 IN THIS CLIP THERE'S AS GENERAL THING THAT COULD POSE A PROBLEM TEA WATER OUT THERE PADDLING
HGblCWBdQeA_2 FIRST COUPLE TIMES AGAIN AGAIN UP PADDLING IN A FINER SELF ACTUALLY DOING A SIDE A BORDER THE PADDLE
HGblCWBdQeA_3 VERY EASY FOR THE MODEL THAT ROB AGAINST THE THIGH GUNNELS OF THE BOARD I GUESS YOU WOULD CALL IT IN A BOATS MINCED TURN
HGblCWBdQeA_4 BUT RATHER THAN DOING THAT THE FIRST COUPLE TIMES MAKE SURE YOU AN ACTUAL WIFE ATALIE GET INTO THE GROOVE OF IT
HGblCWBdQeA_5 YOU CAN SEE WE ACTUALLY DO A LOT OF STAND UP PADDLE TOURS INSERT A GUIDE IT EXECUTIVE TRAPS AND A LOT OF THE GADGETS KIDNEYS PILED UP THE ROBIN I'M RIGHT UP AGAINST THE GUNNELS YOU CAN SEE THAT A LITTLE MORE WHERE IT'S AT AND THAT SHOULD BE THERE

G-D1VVcSptE_5 NOW THE SWEET SPOT IS VERY FINE THAT EXACT SPOT WHERE YOU ARE BALANCING AND THEY ARE NOT LEANING TOO FAR FORWARD TO NOT LEANING TOO FAR BACK F OR TO THE SIDE OR THE OTHER SIDE
G-D1VVcSptE_6 IF IT AWAY DISPLACEMENT WHEN I'M RUNNING UNICYCLE I USUALLY LEAN BACK JUST A LITTLE THAT FOR
G-D1VVcSptE_7 TWO REASONS USUALLY I CAN VALANCE MIGHT WEIGHT OF MY IT'S CHEST IS OVER MY FEET
G-D1VVcSptE_8 THIS DIFFERS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT FOR THE MOST PART FOR THE OTHER
G-D1VVcSptE_9 INSIDE WAS OF WRITTEN WITH THEY ALL AGREE WITH THE SAME THING A CUFF NOW WHEN I'M LEANING BACK ANOTHER REASON IS BECAUSE IF YOU'RE IN THE FALL AND YOU'RE GOING TO FALL YOU ONE HALL AND BACKWARDS OKAY SO THUMB ON THE SHOW YOU THAT IN A FUTURE SETH LEAST AGENT

ggyQaBY9Mq8_1 THIS IS JOHN THEN A BROKEN ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE I AM INVITING YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR SERIES OF INTERMEDIATE STAGES OF ENCAUSTIC PAINTING
ggyQaBY9Mq8_2 NOW WE TALKED ABOUT RUBBER STAMPS BUT ANOTHER METHOD OF USING WAX TO COVER AN IMAGE IS WITH PHOTOGRAPHY
ggyQaBY9Mq8_3 A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE INTO PHOTOGRAPHY SO THE MIX WAX REALLY OF IS EXCITING FOR THEM
ggyQaBY9Mq8_4 HOW I STARTED WAS WITH A LITTLE IMAGE OF A MAN THAT WAS PERFORMING OVER IN VICTORIA ON THE STREET TOOK IS IMAGE HOME IN BECAUSE I'M IN A GALLERY WHERE WE HAVE PAIN YOU WORK EVERY MONTH THIS IDEA CAME TO ME THE ABOUT USING THE TIRE
ggyQaBY9Mq8_5 SO HERE I TOOK HIS IMAGE I WENT TO A PRINT SHOT I HADN'T PRINTED ON A PIECE OF SHINY CARD STOCK AND THEN I JUST BEGIN TO WAX ON TOP OF THE SURFACE
ggyQaBY9Mq8_6 I DIDN'T PUT CLEAR WAX DOWN FIRST JUST LIKE WITH RUBBER STAMPS BUT I GOT THIS IMAGE WHICH WAS THE FIRST ONE I TRIED IN IT BECAME VERY POPULAR
ggyQaBY9Mq8_7 AND ONCE YOU START SELLING SOMETHING YOU GO IS IS A GOOD IDEA
ggyQaBY9Mq8_8 I THINK I'LL DO SOME MORE SO ANOTHER METHOD THAT I DID WAS TO TAKE A PICTURE OF THE STAFF YOU IN A GARDEN AND THEN I COVERED THAT WITH CLEAR WAX AND IN THIS CASE HEIGHT PUT DOWN SOME TISSUE PAPER AND THEN I SHOWED THE THREADS OF THE TISSUE PAPER THROUGH THE WAX HAND COLORED ON TOP OF THAT SURFACE TO CREATE THIS EFFECT IN IT IT'S THE IT HAS AN INTERESTING TRANSITION FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH TO THE WAX COATING
ggyQaBY9Mq8_9 HERE WAS ANOTHER STATUE IN A GARDEN THAT I TOOK AND THEN DID SOME WAX ON TOP
ggyQaBY9Mq8_10 YOU SEE THE PHOTOGRAPH HANDS RIGHT HERE AND THEN THE WAX CREATES THIS INTERESTING ILLUSION
ggyQaBY9Mq8_11 NOW ONE TIME IN THE GALLERY THAT EVERYBODY WAS GOING TO DO LIFE DRAWINGS AND I THOUGHT LOOK IN THE WORLD CAN I DO
ggyQaBY9Mq8_12 SO I WENT IN DID SOME LIFE DRAWING CLASSES TO SEE WHAT I COULD COME UP WITH AND I TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE MODELS AND IN THIS CASE HERE I STARTED WITH THIS ONE ACTUALLY
ggyQaBY9Mq8_13 I TOOK THE WOMAN AND HIKE HEIGHT PRINTED THE IMAGE NOT ON PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPER BUT ON SILK
ggyQaBY9Mq8_14 I USE SILK TRANSFER PAPER TO USE FOR THE PHOTOGRAPH CUTOUTS SILK TOOK ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPH OF SOME FLOWERS CUT THOSE OUT IN CREATED DRESS FOR YOUR TOOK ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPH OF A STATUE OF THE FACE AND OBSCURE DID WITH THE WAX AND PUT THE WHOLE THING ON TOP OF AN ABSTRACT DESIGN THAT I GET ON FOR SMALL LITTLE CARDS CREATING THIS IMAGE OR COLDER RADIANT DANCER
ggyQaBY9Mq8_15 UNLIKE THE WAY THAT TURNED OUT
ggyQaBY9Mq8_16 IN THIS CASE I TOOK THE MAN AND I HADN'T PRINTED ON SALE AND I WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT TO DO WITH AND THEN I HAVE SOME WAX ON A CARD THAT WAS LAYING ON THE TABLE WIDE GREAT THIS PIECE OF SILK ON TOP OF THAT I CAN SEE THROUGH TO THE WAX CAN JUST BY HEATING IN THE TOP OF THE SURFACE THE WAX CAME THROUGH AND I CALLED IN TATTOO
HcVIsTllkuY_1 ALRIGHT NOW IS THE MOMENT YOU BOLDED WAITING FOR

gjL2cB-ShEE_6 IN CASE YOU'RE MAKING A LEATHER CUT AS IF YOU CAN COME ALL THE WAY OUT THIS A TWENTY FIVE AND A HALF INCH RIP CUTS AS LONG AS THE BOARD COMES EIGHT TEN TWELVE FEET LONG ARM
gjL2cB-ShEE_7 <UNK> WHEN YOU'RE MAKING A THINNER MAKING LONG CUFF
gjL2cB-ShEE_8 WHEN YOU MAKE A DETAIL CUT THAT ONE OF THE FEATURES OF LIGHT ABOVE THE SAW IS SO YOU NEEDED TO BE IN A JUST A LITTLE BIT BEYOND SAY NINE INCHES OR LITTLE WOULD BE ON A CERTAIN MEASUREMENT

GE_u537I4Y4_6 MAYBE MUCH MORE
GE_u537I4Y4_7 CONSERVATIVELY THREE TO FIFTY DOG
GE_u537I4Y4_8 ONE THING IS THIS IS A MALE LIKE THAT'S A FEMALE STYLE
GE_u537I4Y4_9 THERE ARE A LOT MORE THESE AROUND THEN THERE ARE THESE
GE_u537I4Y4_10 THIS HAS A LEATHER SADDLE LEATHER BROOKS MAKES IT MUCH MORE VALUABLE
GE_u537I4Y4_11 IT HAS THE ROD BRAKES AND THESE TIRES THESE WHEELS ARE TWENTY INCHES A NORMAL BY A NORMAL IT WAS LIKE AND OTHERS ARE GONNA BE AROUND TWENTY SIX INCHES FOR AN ADULT LIKE BUT THIS IS TWENTY EIGHT INCH RANGE
GE_u537I4Y4_12 WHICH MAKE IT A VERY DESIRABLE BIKE
GE_u537I4Y4_13 ANOTHER THING IS FRAME SIZE
GE_u537I4Y4_14 THIS IS A VERY VERY LARGE FIRM AND IN GENERAL THE LARGER THE FRAME OF THE BIKE THE MORE VALUABLE THE BIKE IS
GE_u537I4Y4_15 IT MIGHT NOT BE A WRITER FOR MANY PEOPLE BUT FOR COLLECTIBLE THE BIGGER THE FRAME THE BETTER IT IS
gCYhLKkdZbk_1 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE CHANGING THE FLOW IN OUR WHOLE WILL DRIVER EFFORT DAYS
gCYhLKkdZbk_2 IN THIS THAT ON AND DEMONSTRATE THE PROPER JACKING PROCEDURE FOR GETTING A FRONT IN OUR FOR OUR UP SO WE CAN FIT UNDERNEATH AND CHANGE OUR TRANSFER HE'S MOVE
gCYhLKkdZbk_3 AND WE'RE AIMING FOR IF THE FULL EXCELLENT IS THE A
gCYhLKkdZbk_4 THE FRONT AS INTO THE ALARM FEED THEM THAT HAVE A SLIGHT LEFT HORSE HIGH UNDER THE CENTER OF
gCYhLKkdZbk_5 OR IF IT IS THE L ENDING IN GETTING ENOUGH
gCYhLKkdZbk_7 OF OUR THERE'S BOX IF YOU GO INTO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT <UNK> VEHICLE CONTINUALLY WILL MANIPULATIONS OR WHAT HAVE YOU
gCYhLKkdZbk_8 IT'S WRITTEN TAKE UP A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT NOW OFF AND SET IT ON AND ASK IF IF OF COOK WITH
gCYhLKkdZbk_9 AT THE HIGH ENOUGH
gCYhLKkdZbk_10 ALRIGHT AND TAKE AND SLIP MY JACKS <UNK> UNDER THE INNER AT A ON THE CONTROL <UNK>
gCYhLKkdZbk_12 AND THEY'RE NOT REALLY THAT LOOK THIS ON THE SIDE
gCYhLKkdZbk_13 IF FOOT OR IF YOU HAVE FAITH
gCYhLKkdZbk_14 RIGHT HERE IS YOUR LOWER CONTROL OR ANY MIRRORS MILES AWAY TO THE FRONT SUSPENSION NEEDED A HEAVY GAUGE STAND I'M OF IN A STAR ENOUGH TO HOLD OF YOU LAW
gCYhLKkdZbk_15 AND THAT HOT OUT YOUR GAS AND CAUSE MORE INEFFICIENT AT LET THEM RIGHT ONTO THE COLOR
gCYhLKkdZbk_16 I'VE BEEN DRESSES LOVE AS WELL TO WITH UP
gCYhLKkdZbk_18 WHATEVER JACKS THINSET EVEN VERY SLOWLY RELEASE THE PRESSURE ON YOUR FLORIDA
gCYhLKkdZbk_19 BUT IF THERE ARE LEFT THEN LET ALL F <UNK> OFF FROM UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE

gCYhLKkdZbk_21 PLACING IT JACKS AND UNSETTLING VEHICLE DOWN ON TO THOSE THINGS
gupPatBYC4I_1 NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PAINT THE STYROFOAM BALL BEING THAT THE STYROFOAM BALL IS GOING TO BE SITTING AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH IT'S GOING TO BE THE CENTER OF THE WINDMILL WE'RE ALL ALL THE ARMS ARE GOING TO BE HANGING
gupPatBYC4I_2 IT'S GOING TO BE WHAT IS A WHAT THE EYE IS GOING TO CATCH FIRST LIMIT THE OF THE WINDMILL
gupPatBYC4I_3 SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE PAINTING IT WE'RE GOING TO USE FOR OUR WINDOW WILL GIVE IT A NICE PURPLE COLOR AND THAT I THINK IS ANY REAL NEED TO DECORATE IT IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT ON COLORS ARE IN THE WILD WAY BUT YOU WANT IT TO USE OF A COLOR SCHEME THAT IT SHOULD FIT IN WITH THE REGULAR BODY OF THE MILK CARTON WHICH IS GOING TO BE THE BODY OF THE WINDMILL
gupPatBYC4I_4 SO IT'S ALSO EASY TO PAINT IT WHILE IT'S ON AND ON THE STATE BECAUSE A BALL IS HARD TO GRIP WALL WALL PAINTING IT SO ON THIS LEG USES WAY TO HOLD ON TO THE BALL AND GET ALL SIDES UNDERNEATH AND ON TOP ALL AROUND THE BALL VERY EASILY WHILE IT'S ON THE STICK
gupPatBYC4I_5 DOESN'T MATTER IF THE STICK GETS PAINT ON IT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE INSERTED INTO THE MILK CARTON
gupPatBYC4I_6 THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOING TO BE SEEN ON THE OUTSIDE IS BASICALLY BEING THE BALL ITSELF
gupPatBYC4I_7 ON THE TOP PART IS GOING TO BE A BEAD PLACED ON IT SO THAT IN THE BALL WILL SIT SECURELY IN ONE FULL OF THE STICK
gupPatBYC4I_8 AND THE OUTSIDE OPPOSITE SIDE AS WELL THE B OF EVEN THE ANY PART OF THE STICK RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE BALL IS GOING TO BE INSIDE AGAINST THE MILK CARTON SO YOU REALLY WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT'S EVEN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING THE STICK DIRTY WHILE YOU'RE PAINTING IT
gupPatBYC4I_9 ONCE IT'S ALL COVERED WEEKEND LET IT SIT AND WE CAN GET IT READY FOR PUTTING INSIDE THE MILK CARTON

glmpBO0gR14_6 THAT SORT OF FILLS IN BREAKS UP SOME OF THE BLACK
glmpBO0gR14_7 AND THEN YOU COULD ADD A PAIR OF GOLD HOOP EARRINGS

Gvo_YK6zbu0_3 SO LET'S TAKE UP OUR EYE CAT COSTUME FROM BOTTOM TO TOP
Gvo_YK6zbu0_4 OR IN A START WITH THE FEET
Gvo_YK6zbu0_5 BUT IF EVEN NEED TWO ITEMS
Gvo_YK6zbu0_6 FIRST OFF YOU NEED SOME BLACK SOCKS SOME GOOD OLD BASIC BLACK SOCKS
Gvo_YK6zbu0_7 NOTHING TO GET IT DONE FLOREA ON
Gvo_YK6zbu0_8 YOU HAVE THESE BLACK SOCKS MOST CONVENIENT STORES
Gvo_YK6zbu0_9 THE OVERALL COSTUME IS GOING TO BE BLACK

gYf9Ba9uVKk_2 AND CHOP SIDEWAYS THEY'RE HOLDING A HAND THIS WAY LIGHT
gYf9Ba9uVKk_3 AND BECAUSE THIS IS OFTEN A SENSITIVE AREA AND HORSE I'LL USE LIGHT PRESSURE OR LONGER THAN AN LIGHT IN ANOTHER AREA JUST TO GET THINGS LOOSENED UP
gYf9Ba9uVKk_4 REALLY CAN FIND THE STROKE TO THAT AREA DON'T WILL FURTHER DOWN THE HORSES BACK OR ON TO THE HORSE'S SIDE AND THEY'RE NOT CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS IF YOU'RE DOING UNTIL THERE FULLY WARMED UP
gYf9Ba9uVKk_5 SO USE LIGHT PRESSURE MODERATE PRESSURE UP A HEAVIER PRESSURE
gYf9Ba9uVKk_6 THE <UNK> AND THEN IF THEY STARTER RESPOND WAY LET'S ANOTHER NOT ENJOY IT THE WAY SHE WHO DID IS NOW ANY LIFTED HIS HEAD AND KIND OF LOOK THAT MAY BACK OFF ON IT
gYf9Ba9uVKk_7 AIKOFF GO DOWN TO MODERATE PRESSURE AGAIN GO DOWN TO LIGHT PRESSURE FINISH UP WITH LIGHT PRESSURE
GEhU3uPHqIs_1 IF THIS IS SEAN FROM EXPERT VILLAGE OF <UNK>
GEhU3uPHqIs_2 IF WE HAD IT RADIO ONE EIGHTY OVER SPINE IS A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO IT
GEhU3uPHqIs_3 YOU CAN EITHER FLY OUT YOU COMPLETE ONE EIGHTY AND HAVE THEM THAT WORDS OR REAL EASY WAY WHICH IS THE ONE ON THE SHOW IT IS A JUST ADD YOUR FRONT TIRE ON AN ANGLE BACKWARDS OVER
GEhU3uPHqIs_4 THE REASON THAT ONE AND CAN BE A LITTLE BETTER FREE WE'RE TRYING TO LEARN THE OVER TO CLICK TO FAKIE IT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE TO USE TO GET YOUR TIRE ON THE FRONT OR AT OUR HEAD ON THE ON ON THE SPINE AND THEN GOING TO FAKIE
GEhU3uPHqIs_5 SO THE DELIVERY COLORFUL THINGS AT ONCE WHICH AGAIN WHAT I DO IS GO BASS OF IT UP ON THE FRONT TIRE AND USING A LITTLE BIT OF PRECISION VIETTI CONFIDENT
GEhU3uPHqIs_6 YOU HIT YOUR TIRE BETWEEN THE TWO COPING TO THE SPARRING <UNK> TIRE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN THE TWO COPING THAT WE CAN GET LOCKED DANIEL'S THAT ARE IN
GEhU3uPHqIs_7 THEN WHAT YOUR WEIGHT IN YOUR MOMENTUM CARRY BACK OVER A LITTLE FAKIE DOWN THE OTHER SIDE THAT'S WHERE FAKIE SKILLS COME INTO PLAY
GEhU3uPHqIs_8 SO WE DROP THEN OVER ACROSS THE SPINE IF THE F AND COME DOWN PLACE ATTIRE JUST RUNNING WITH LIMITED UP AND GIVE IT A TRY
GEhU3uPHqIs_9 <UNK> IS TO GET TIRED BETWEEN THE TWO CO THINGS THAT LITTLE SLITH OUT
GEhU3uPHqIs_10 THE IN AND TAKE A LITTLE FAITH

HFdsk3MZcnk_3 YOU HAVE THAT SHOW EVERYBODY ON EITHER SIDE IT'S AN
HFdsk3MZcnk_4 IF YOU ELIMINATE OR BODY THE OF IT'S AN WE'VE OWNED A TITLE CURVED TIME RUN OUT

-gwTchCnaQg_1 RIGHT THE FIRST MOVEMENT WE LIKE TO DO AN ARE STANDING SERIES AND CALL APPLE PICKING
-gwTchCnaQg_2 YOU CAN BE USING THE SAME ENGAGEMENT THAT WE LEARNED BEFORE
-gwTchCnaQg_3 THE TWO BIG AND HOW DO THE RIBS IF EXHALE RIBS GO DOWN
-gwTchCnaQg_4 <UNK> FROM EVEN EXTEND ONE ARM HERE AND BRING MY RIGHT ARM AND THE RIBS ARE GOING TO EXPAND AND LIFT TO THE RIGHT SIDE AS IF I HAVE AN APPLE NEUTRINO REACHING A TICKET

-gwTchCnaQg_12 I'M AN AVERAGE YOU HAVE AN ARM REACH FOR YOUR EXPANDING RIBS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO STAY ENGAGED
-gwTchCnaQg_13 THE GOAL IS STAYING GAUGE AS YOU LENGTHEN AS YOU REACH TO BE FEELING THIS IN THE OLD LEAK INTO THE LOWER BACK
-gwTchCnaQg_14 AND THAT'S A FEW OUT OF PICKING
H1-j6LC90bg_1 SO EACH AND TIE IT WITH ONE OF THE DICE IN THE GAME OF TRAIN IS SIX SIDED AND THERE ARE SIX THAT'S
H1-j6LC90bg_2 NOW I TALK ABOUT HOW EACH ONE ON EACH SIDE HAS EIGHT ARTICULATE PART OF A TRAIN ON IT
H1-j6LC90bg_3 EACH SIDE OF THE DICE HAS A PARTICULARLY NUMBER ON TO A CORRESPONDING NUMBER
H1-j6LC90bg_4 AND THESE ARE POINTS THE ENDS
H1-j6LC90bg_5 THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS KING IS THAT NUMBER SIX AND FIVE DO NOT ACTUALLY SCORE POINTS
H1-j6LC90bg_6 BUT THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN NUMBERS TO EXPLAIN WHERE THEY GO IN THE SEQUENCE
H1-j6LC90bg_7 SIX IS THE ENGINE THE HEAD OF THE TRAIN
H1-j6LC90bg_8 FIVE IS THE COLTON WHICH ALWAYS GOES WITH THE ENGINE
H1-j6LC90bg_9 AND THEN FOR THE MORE THE CARGO CARS AND THIS IS WORTH POINTS
H1-j6LC90bg_10 YOU KNOW THAT WAS THE COLORS GET INVOLVED AND SET OF BLACK AND WHITE DICE WITH COLORS
H1-j6LC90bg_11 IF IT'S GOT A COLOR ON THE SIDE THEN IT'S CHORDS POINTS
H1-j6LC90bg_12 SO THERE'S FOUR POINTS
H1-j6LC90bg_13 THERE IS THREE TWO AND THEN THE CABOOSE IS WORTH ONE
H1-j6LC90bg_14 THE GREASE SCANNING NEED BECAUSE AND ALSO IF YOU'RE ABLE TO TO PUT A CABOOSE OWNER DRAIN YOU W SCORE
H1-j6LC90bg_15 SO THOSE ARE VOICE VALUES FOR THE TRAIN DICE

H4onp2hk--k_1 HI I'M MELODY ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE
H4onp2hk--k_2 I'M JUST GONNA SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SUPPLIES THE THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE FOR WATER AT LEAST HAVE TO TRY AND JUMP START DRAWING IN HALF FELT
H4onp2hk--k_3 <UNK> ARE A THIRD OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS THAT WE'VE DESCRIBED THROUGHOUT SEVERAL OR SEGMENTS
H4onp2hk--k_4 THEY'RE THE LOCK STYLE THAT ARE MORE LIGHT CHALK IF IT'S THE SAME THING ONLY ANOTHER VERSION WITH ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS COLORS
H4onp2hk--k_5 THERE'S THE OIL BASED HAVE SO WHICH IS A LOT OF FUN IN IT LANDS OF EITHER WITH A FEW TIPS ARE ACTUALLY I'VE TRIED IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF THONG PAINT REMOVER LACQUER THINNER AND IT'S AN INTERESTING PROCESS BUT I THINK JUST TO KEEP THE SMELLS DOWN AND JUST HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN TO STRIKE BLENDING IT FIRST WITH THE PROFESSIONAL CUTE HIT HER UP OR THE NOTES THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER AND I'LL EXPLAIN TO THOSE YOU JUST A MINUTE
H4onp2hk--k_6 WE ALSO HAVE PASTELS THAT ACTUALLY COME IN PENCIL FORM YOU SHARPEN THESE WITH REAL PENCIL SHARPENER <UNK> OF THAT AND FIRST ARE PENCILS TO TRANSFER AS YOU CAN SEE THE ARE A LITTLE DISH FATTER THAN REGULAR PENCIL AND THIS IS THE CLEANEST WAY DOWN
H4onp2hk--k_7 I THINK SUMMIT UNIT FOLLOWED IS THROUGH OR SEGMENTS TO SEE JUST HOW DIRTY MY FINGERS DID GET WITH THESE AND I SHOULD HAVE A LOT OF FUN DOING
H4onp2hk--k_8 NOW THESE YOU CAN BUY THESE AT MOST CRAFT AN ART SUPPLY STORES AND BASICALLY IT'S TIGHTLY WOUND VERY VERY DENSE PAPER HERE AND AS THEY GET OLD THEY DO GET A LITTLE BIT ROUNDER IN YOU CAN PEEL THEM AND PULL THAT PAPER OFF AND THEN CARRIED IN THE SHARPER AGAIN
H4onp2hk--k_9 THEY'RE NOT VERY EXPENSIVE AND EASY TO USE
H4onp2hk--k_10 JUST COMPOSITION YOU PROBABLY WANT A RULER IT'S MUCH POSSIBLY COMPASS AND IN OUR NEXT SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT A HOUSE KINDS PAID FOR THAT YOU WOULD USE FOR THIS TYPE OF PROJECT
GRbQNAIOI80_1 THE NEXT THING I'M DEAL WITH IS THE INTONATION ON THIS PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT
GRbQNAIOI80_2 ON AND WE WILL HAVE TO USE A HUNDRED ATTIC TUNER
GRbQNAIOI80_3 OR YOU CAN USE A STROBE TUNER HAUNTED HOUSE OF SOME KIND ON IN ORDER TO GET AN ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF WHETHER OR NOT THE PITCH OF AN OPEN STRING AND THE PITCH AT THE TWELFTH HARMONICA THE OCTAVE IS THE SAME
GRbQNAIOI80_4 AND WHETHER THAT PITCH SHIFTS WHEN WE PRESS THE STRING DOWN AND STRETCH IT
GRbQNAIOI80_5 SO THAT'S WHAT INTONATIONS ALL ABOUT
GRbQNAIOI80_6 AND THE WAY TO ADJUST THE INTONATION IS WE MAY HAVE TO ADJUST THE CROWN OF THE SADDLE
GRbQNAIOI80_7 WE MIGHT HAVE TO ADJUST THE ANGLE OF THE SADDLE
GRbQNAIOI80_8 OR IF YOU LOOK ON THIS INSTRUMENT YOU CAN SEE FA HAVE BUILT IN SOME INTONATION BY EVEN SHIFTING WHERE THE CROWN OF THAT SADDLE EXISTS HER ON THE E STRING
GRbQNAIOI80_9 IT'S ON THE SAND OUT IN ON THE B STRING IT'S ON THE SCENT
GRbQNAIOI80_10 SO IT'S A JUST THINK THE DISTANCE FOR THE LENGTH OF THE STRING WE THE SADDLE ADJUSTMENTS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PITCH OF THE HOSE THREE THINGS ALL THE <UNK> BALL OCTAVE HARMONIC HAY AND PLAYED NOTE ARE ALL EXACTLY THE SAME
g8ujePz4CCg_1 AND WITH NEXT IS THE PRINT OUT AND THE THE PIN
g8ujePz4CCg_2 BELLY THE BASIN WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING TO PEAKING USE ON BE THROUGH WITH CUPPING WITH OVER THE VESSEL THE ZERO
g8ujePz4CCg_3 NOW WHEN USING THE CONTROL TWENTY FOUR AND SEE THAT THE OTHERS METERS AT THE VERY TOP
g8ujePz4CCg_4 WHAT HAPPENS IS IS A VERY THERE'S A RED MEAT AT THE VERY TOP AND NEVER THIS GETS HIT IT STAYS ON
g8ujePz4CCg_5 YOU COULD ALSO CLEAR BY PRESSING IS CLEAR CAN FALL AND IF UNLESS I
g8ujePz4CCg_6 NOW WHEN YOU HAVE THIS BOTTOM I HEAR ME CLEAR IT IS AND GET RID OF IT
g8ujePz4CCg_7 AS SOON AS IT PICKS UP AGAIN IT'S A SHOW THAT USING THIS IS THE STORE AND SO DON'T YOU ONLY WANT ANYTHING TO THE STORE
g8ujePz4CCg_8 IT ALSO SHOW YOU RIGHT HERE IF WITHIN YOUR INPUT INTO MY SEWING THE RECORDING SOMETHING OF A NEW SHOES TO TURN ON YOUR MIGRAINE
g8ujePz4CCg_9 BY HITTING THE SOURCE BALL IN THE WATER MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T PEAK ON THE WAY IN IS NOT PEAKING AFTER AS WELL
g8ujePz4CCg_10 SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THE ONE MAKE SURE THAT THIS THE SPEAKERS AND ALONG AND THESE NEVER RIDGE RED
g8e9FZQWkMM_1 WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR A VEGETABLE STOCK HEAT UP OR GREEN GO AHEAD AND TURN UP OUR BACK BURNER UP TO ABOUT EIGHT
g8e9FZQWkMM_2 IT CAN OR A TABLE AND OIL WITH IT AND HOW LARGE POT IS WILL MOVE OUR LITTLE ROUND SO THAT COVERS ALL OF THE BOTTOM TYPE OF A POT
g8e9FZQWkMM_3 ALLYN WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR THAT HE AND COME BACK TO OUR VEGETABLE STOCK
g8e9FZQWkMM_4 THEY'RE STILL BIT SECONDS EVEN FLOATING AROUND IN THERE AND ONE AND BREAK THOSE UP TO IT AS MUCH AS WE CAN
g8e9FZQWkMM_5 TO IT AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR HALF A CUP OF RICE THIN WE'RE GOING TO DUMP THEM HIDDEN BOTTOM HALF OF OUR HEAD
g8e9FZQWkMM_6 IN A JUST HALF SWINGS AROUND TOUGH TOUGH TOUGH LIST EQUAL OVER THE BOTTOM
g8e9FZQWkMM_7 AND ONCE OUR VEGETABLES TO IT COULD TALK TUNA GO AHEAD AND MEASURE OUT ONE CUP OF THE FLORIDA AND RICE
g8e9FZQWkMM_8 IT IS CAN FOOD BOIL HALF WRITTEN OF PUT ON A TALK AND REDUCE OUR HEAT DOWN TO FOUR AND LET IT COOK UNTIL THE VEGETABLE STOCK IS JUST ABOUT ALL THE EFFORT
H0-wO7ShPGw_1 A BODY THE ROOT HERE AN EXPERT ON DIVING CHECKED OUT OF OUR DIVER BOUTS IT SIT ENTER THE WATER WHAT WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT SLASH GOING ON
H0-wO7ShPGw_2 WHAT I DID THEY SO THAT HER HITTING VERTICAL
H0-wO7ShPGw_3 WHAT WE DID MAKE SURE THAT HAVE GOOD BODY LINE
H0-wO7ShPGw_4 IF YOU'RE COMPETITIVE DIVER FOOT HE GOT IF THEY ARE THEY SURE YOU GET A HIGH SCHOOL OR POSSIBLE
H0-wO7ShPGw_5 A SO HOW DO WE ENTER THE WATER
H0-wO7ShPGw_6 THAT'S WHY WHEN TEACHING RIGHT NOW A I'M GET BACK DOWN OF RUM FLOWING
H0-wO7ShPGw_7 LOOK AT OUR DIVE AN AREA WATER WE SHOULD BE WHEN IT HAVE FUN ARE DOWN AS POSSIBLE ON WITH THE CHINA CURL YOUR TOES UNDERNEATH MY KNEES ARE TOGETHER AND WALK OUT STRAIGHT ON THAT
H0-wO7ShPGw_8 THIS V THOUGH VISIBLE ARCH IN YOUR BODY IT WILL BE RIGHT NOW OF ARCHING IS REMOVABLE ART IN YOUR BODY WHEN YOU'RE ENTERING THE WATER
H0-wO7ShPGw_9 THE TRICK TO DO AS A THINK ABOUT FIGURE BELLY BUTTON AND TURN TO SUCK IT THROUGH YOUR BODY TO YOUR BACK
H0-wO7ShPGw_10 THAT WILL HELP HIM BASH LIFE
H0-wO7ShPGw_11 ANOTHER THING THAT YOU CAN DO IT THE TAKE YOUR HIPS AND ROLL THEM UP A LITTLE BIT OF A UPPER BODY ARMPITS THAT OVERHEAD HREF HANDS TOGETHER EYES LOOKING AT THE HAND
H0-wO7ShPGw_12 IF THE PROPER WAY AND THE WATER
Gkjo_HGLNs4_1 NOW ARE THOUGHT ABOUT BANK SHOTS
Gkjo_HGLNs4_2 THING SHOTS ARE NOT ONLY PRETTY LATH THEIR AFFECTIVE HAND OF THEIR HIGHER PERCENTAGE SHOT WHEN YOU USE THEM PROPERLY THEN JUST SHOOTING THE BALL OF THE ROOM ON
Gkjo_HGLNs4_3 AND THAT'S WHY THEY PUT THE OUT THE WHITE WINES OF THERE
Gkjo_HGLNs4_4 TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING THE INDIA
Gkjo_HGLNs4_5 ANOTHER THERE BY ACCIDENT THEIR OF THERE FOR A REASON
Gkjo_HGLNs4_6 IT'S ALMOST TO BE LIKE IN A POOL YOU KNOW IT'S ALL TRAJECTORY IN GEOMETRY
Gkjo_HGLNs4_7 IAN AND YOU HAVE BEEN THE SKIN AND IN THAT YOU JUST HAVE THEM INTO THE AND WHEN YOU PUT THE BALL WHEN YOU'RE IN A CERTAIN POSITION AND YOU PUT THEM ALL OF THEIR OFF OF THE GLASS IT'S KINDA OF THEM COME IN AND BOUNCE INTO THE ON TO THE RIM NOW AND THERE'S MANY <UNK>
Gkjo_HGLNs4_8 THAT'S THE BENEFIT OF USING A GLASS SHOT BACKWARD SHOT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_9 YOU CAN USE A FROM ALMOST ANYWHERE ON THE FLOOR
Gkjo_HGLNs4_10 WHICH YOU WANT TO DO IF YOU'RE OUTSIDE OF THE LANE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE LANE WHEN YOU'RE UP MORE TOWARDS THE FRONT OF OF THE KEY OF DOORS APPEAR YOU DON'T WANT TO USE THE BACK OR SHOT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_11 THOSE ARE CALLED BANK SHOTS OFF OF THE FRONT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_12 YOU JUST THEM REALLY USE THAT IT'S IT'S NOT AS EFFECTIVE
Gkjo_HGLNs4_13 IT'S REALLY MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN YOU'RE USING IT ON THE SIDE OF THE COURT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_14 IT IS THE MAIN IDEA AND IN THIS TAKES PRACTICE
Gkjo_HGLNs4_15 YOU KNOW IT'S IMITATED UNITED <UNK> HERE AND MAYBE ON THIS MY FIRST ONE BUT WE'VE GOT A JUST KEEP PRACTICING AND PRACTICING TO REALLY GET AN IDEA OF RELOAD HIP SEAT RELOAD HIT TO THE TYPE OF THING OF A MACHINE ELITE YELLOW CRACK
Gkjo_HGLNs4_16 SEE IN A MISSED MY SHOT
Gkjo_HGLNs4_17 THE KEY PRACTICE IT YOU CAN START IN CLOSER TO THE IN USE THAT FACT WORK
Gkjo_HGLNs4_18 AND THAT'S A GOOD THAT THE GUIDE STRATEGY IS TO IN SHOOT TWENTY FIFTY A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED SHOTS FROM THIS SIDE WHO IS IN THE BACK WE WEREN'T <UNK> TO <UNK>
Gkjo_HGLNs4_19 GET SHOOTING LOOSEN IT THAT ORGAN AND STEP BACK TO ONE MORE STEP AND SHOOT IT IN YOU GET USED TO A NEW BE AN EXPERT TO WITH A GREAT WITH AN SHOT AND PIE
HbkUVUcdzeg_1 THE NOTCHES MACHINE IS BASICALLY A ALMOST UM A CANISTER DEVICE THAT HOLDS OXYGEN IN THAT THE GAS WILL WE KNOW IS THE NOTCHES OXIDE
HbkUVUcdzeg_2 AGAIN NOTCHES OUTSIDE IT IS A GAS THAT WE KNOW THAT WHEN ONE BREATHE IN THROUGH YOUR NOSE THAT ARE A COUPLE MINUTES OF EXPOSURE TIME IT WILL ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A FEELING OF OF WILL LOMASNEY FOR AREA
HbkUVUcdzeg_3 CERTAINLY THE MOST IMPORTANT SHOE AND SQUEEZE OR WHAT WE CALL HAND INSTRUMENTS
HbkUVUcdzeg_4 HAND INSTRUMENTS ARE BASICALLY DIFFERENT NOW INSURANCE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND DIFFERENT POINTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT IF IT WE USE FOR A BROAD AMOUNT OF PROCEDURES
HbkUVUcdzeg_5 AND IT CAN BE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS NEW DOING EXAM OR FIXING FILLING OR MAYBE DOING AND CLEANING OR IT CAN BE IS BROUGHT IS IN DOING AN EXTRACTION OR DOING A ROOT CANAL
HbkUVUcdzeg_6 THOSE THINGS WE BASICALLY THESE ARE ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF HAND INSTRUMENTS SO AND THERE ARE A LOT OF ATTENTION IS THAT WE UTILIZE
HbkUVUcdzeg_7 CERTAINLY WITH THE DANCES NOSE NOTORIOUS FOR AS THE HANDRAIL WHICH IS AN OBJECT THAT WE USE TYPICALLY TO REMOVE CAVITIES ASSAM TIMES REMOVAL OF FILLINGS OR TO DO IN COSMETIC PREPARATIONS ON TEA THERE IF EVEN THINGS LIKE OR MOVING BONE AROUND TEETH
HbkUVUcdzeg_8 SOME OF THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS WE USE IN WE USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT X-RAY DEVICES THAT CAPTURE IMAGES OF THE OF THE GUM AND THE BONE IN THE SUPPORTING TEA

HbkUVUcdzeg_10 OTHER THINGS THAT WE CAN OFTEN USE OF BREEZE DOES LOTS OF DIFFERENT PRESSURE MATERIALS A LOT OF THINGS INDENTURE WE DO WE REQUIRE SOME SORT OF MOLD AND PATIENTS MOUTH SO THERE'S VARIOUS MATERIALS DEPENDING ON WHAT SORT OF CROSS DECISIONMAKING THE PATIENT
HbkUVUcdzeg_11 WE USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PRESSURE MATERIALS
HbkUVUcdzeg_12 AS FAR AS AS FAR AS THE PAIN REALLY REALLY GO IN THERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT WE CAN BIRDS THAT WE CAN PRESENT TO A PATIENT WHO AGAIN IF HAS PROBLEMS DEALING WITH THE ANXIETY OR MORE LESS THE PAIN
HbkUVUcdzeg_13 I'M ONE ONE VERSION IS WHAT WE CALL SEDATION AND SEDATION IS COME A GENERIC TERM FOR DESCRIBE UNWEIGHTED BASICALLY CALM THE PATIENT DOWN IT CAN BE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS GIVING THEM SOME LAUGHING GAS ALSO KNOWN AS NOTCHES OXIDE WHICH CAN CAN HELP RELIEVE THE NERVES OF THE PATIENT
HbkUVUcdzeg_14 IT ALSO HELPS WITH PAIN CONTROLS LAW
HbkUVUcdzeg_15 THAT IS COME THE SIMPLEST FORM
HbkUVUcdzeg_16 THERE'S OTHER FORMS WHAT A SUCH AS OR SEDATION WHICH ONE INVOLVING AND TAKING A POLE AND BEFORE THE APPOINTMENT MAT CUTTER HELPS IF CREATING UM <UNK> CAN HELPS RELIEVE SOME LEARNING SIDING CONSUME HELP WITH PAIN AS WELL
HbkUVUcdzeg_17 THE OTHER FORMS OF SEDATION AND WE CAN OFFER A PATIENT WOULD BE A IV SEDATION WHERE MY THESE ACTUALLY STARTING RON AND MEDICATIONS ARE ACTUALLY PUSH THE DRIVE EATING THAT ACTUALLY HELPS PITCH ASLEEP

HbkUVUcdzeg_19 AND IT'S ALSO WOOD WHICH IS THE BROAD IS ONE WHICH IS CALLED GENERAL ANESTHESIA WHICH TYPICALLY ISN'T SEEN A DENTAL ENVIRONMENT UNLESS IT'S ASSOCIATE WITH OIL SURGEON <UNK>
HbkUVUcdzeg_20 THAT'S WHERE OF ANOTHER TYPE OF MASK ON LIKE THE LAUGHING GASES PUT ON THE PATIENT AND THEY ARE BASICALLY PUT COMPLETELY ON OR TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WILL NOT FILL IN A THING THEY CAN HEAR ANYTHING
HbkUVUcdzeg_21 IT'S A LITTLE MORE STREAM AND NOT VERY COMMON AND DENTAL SCENARIO BUT IT IS AVAILABLE

h5-xMqT_n24_2 THE BEST THING TO DO WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS TO BACKING IT AND WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND WOULD BE TO TAKE AND THE UPHOLSTERY CLEANING PART OF THAT
h5-xMqT_n24_3 AND THE REASON WHY I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ON USING THE UPHOLSTERY I TOOL OF A VACUUM VERSUS THE BEATER BRUSH IS THAT WE WANT TO TACKLED ON ONE TO EXTRACT THE LOOSE SOIL
h5-xMqT_n24_4 AND ON OUR B A BAR ON THE VACUUM MAY UP MAY ACTUALLY AND THAT THE SOIL FURTHER BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT'S DOING THIS JOB
h5-xMqT_n24_5 IT'S TRYING TO LOOSEN DIRT BUT THIS PARTICULAR CASE ON ON USING UP A LITTLE BIT OF A DAMP SOIL BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES WE'RE PUTTING UP LANSING AND SOMETIMES WE WE HAVE A LITTLE WATER IN THERE TOO
h5-xMqT_n24_6 SO WE DON'T CREATE MY IT
h5-xMqT_n24_7 WE WANT IT ON EXTRACT THE LOOSE SOIL CELL IT'S GOING TO STEP NUMBER ONE VACUUM
h5-xMqT_n24_8 NOW AN ACTING PROCESS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT WAS TAKING THE CUP AND JUST PLACING IT ON THE SURFACE VERSUS SCRUBBING NEVER SCRUB

h5-xMqT_n24_10 GET AS MUCH LOOSE SOIL UP AS YOU CAN ON THAT SANTA
G78nL9acDGo_1 ONE INDISPENSABLE FEATURE YOU NEED WHEN YOU READ A CROSSWORD PUZZLE IS YOU NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE THE OUNCES

G78nL9acDGo_5 BUT FOR THE THE GRID UPSIDE DOWN WITH THE SOLUTION AND
G78nL9acDGo_6 ANOTHER WAY IS JUST A LIST THE WOODS WITH THE NUMBER OF THE CLUE
G78nL9acDGo_7 OR EXPANDING ON THAT FOR A CRYPTIC CROSSWORD USE SOME SO SHORTHAND INFORMATION TO INDICATE THAT TYPE OF TO HOW IT IS CONSTRUCTED
G78nL9acDGo_8 FOR EXAMPLE WHAT I DO IT I USE BRACES TO INDICATE AN ANAGRAM
G78nL9acDGo_9 A HYPHEN TO INDICATE POSSIBLE WHEN THE CHARADE CLUE
G78nL9acDGo_10 PARENTHESES TO INDICATE TO ONE WOULD INSIDE ANOTHER

h2VKacwXr_w_2 IN THIS CLIP A MINUTE TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT ON
h2VKacwXr_w_3 THIS IS A GREAT DRILL FOR GO OFF FIRST MOVE THAT OF THE GOOD HABIT OF FLICKR RAT IN A GOOD IN THAT POSITION
h2VKacwXr_w_4 MANY TIMES WITH SIENNA THERE'S JUST HITTING COPLAND ABOUT AND HE WOULDN'T MODE BIG CUFF IS IS THE HEAD OF THE HANDS AND THE LATE REMAINS BLACK IN INTO YOUR BACK AND ADD YOUR RIGHT LEG FOR MY HAND OF PLAYERS

h2VKacwXr_w_6 AS YOU IN ROOT BID THE SETS THAT'S AN GUM HIT YOU IMASCO MEMORIES GONNA START ABOUT UP IN THE HABIT OF ROOTING DOWN AND GET IN THE HANDS AHEAD OF THE TOP AND HAS BEEN HOW TO HIT GET A MUCH BETTER COUNT THAT HAS THAT OFTEN
h2VKacwXr_w_7 THIS IS WHERE THE NOTE OF A CONNECTING OFF
GkdhQEhbxS4_1 CAN
GkdhQEhbxS4_2 NOW CONSUMER CAMERAS DON'T NORMALLY HAVE MANUAL ON THERE
GkdhQEhbxS4_3 THIS IS A PRO SIMMER MODEL AND IT HAS MANUAL ON THERE IN THE DIGITAL SLR TIGHTENING ON
GkdhQEhbxS4_4 THAT ALLOWS THE ANGLE IN THERE AND TO TIGHT LINING IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN AN AVERAGE LIKE METER BUILT INTO A CAMRO CAN HANDLE AND IT ALSO LIVE A CUSTOM LINING SHOTS WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE MORE PRO
GkdhQEhbxS4_5 YOU'VE ALSO GOT A CUSTOM WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO CUSTOM SET UP YOUR OWN PARAMETERS FOR FROM OF WOOD
GkdhQEhbxS4_6 AND YOU GOT A MOVIE THE ABILITY TO TIGHTEN MOVE THESE WITH SOUND ON THIS CAMERA
GkdhQEhbxS4_7 WHICH HAPPENS A LOT OWN MOST CONSUMER MODELS WELL
GkdhQEhbxS4_8 YOU HAVE A SCREEN NOTE WHICH IS THE LAST A PET FROM ABOUT TWELVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF SUBJECTS WITHIN THAT MODE ITSELF

hg0PYALmd64_4 SO WHAT WE DO NOT OVER GETTING IN THE LONGER IRONS AND THEY'RE NOT QUITE AS LOFTED YOU GIVE IT A GENERATE MORE SIDE SPIN ON IT
hg0PYALmd64_5 SO YOU GET THE NORMAL UNDERSPIN OF STRIKING THE BALL WITH A CLOSE THE FACE LIKE THIS TO CREATE SOME SIDES AS THE BALL WILL SPIN AND GO TO THE LEFT
hg0PYALmd64_6 SO IF YOU GET EASIER LEISURE TO HOOK THE BALL
hg0PYALmd64_7 SO WE WANT A YOU YOU WANTED TO BE A JAW NOT A HAWKS LEAKING CONTROL
hg0PYALmd64_8 SO WOULDN'T NOTE IS THIS IS HOW YOU LINE UP FOR THE NORMAL STRAIGHT BALL
hg0PYALmd64_9 AND I'M A MORE TO THE LAUGH
hg0PYALmd64_10 SO I ROTATE A LITTLE OVER A MAN I CLOSE THE CLUB FACE OF AND THEN I SWING NORMAL
hg0PYALmd64_11 OR THE <UNK> TO HIT A LITTLE EXTRA DISTANCE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU DRAW THE BALL

gb3dLfgPH0I_8 SO LEAVE A MARGIN OF AN INCH ON EITHER SIDE
gb3dLfgPH0I_9 THAT'S HOW WIDE I KNOW MY PIECE IS GOING TO BE
gb3dLfgPH0I_10 AND THEN WHEN I NEED IS A TRIANGLE
gb3dLfgPH0I_11 AND I HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT TRIANGLES WITH YOUR YOUR BASIC TRIANGLE <UNK>
gb3dLfgPH0I_12 AND THIS IS WHAT GIVES ME MY NINETY DEGREE ANGLE
gb3dLfgPH0I_13 SO I'M HOLDING IF THIS GUY VERY VERY FIRMLY
gb3dLfgPH0I_14 PAPERS ATTACHED AND NOW THIS THAT CAN SLIDE ALONG HERE LIKE THIS
gb3dLfgPH0I_15 AGAIN PENCILS STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN

gb3dLfgPH0I_18 BUT BASICALLY THEY'LL HAVE A NINETY <UNK> DEGREE ANGLE FOUR E AND WORK WITH
gb3dLfgPH0I_19 SOME OF THEM JUST BIGGER KITCHEN EVEN BIGGER ONE
gb3dLfgPH0I_20 AN OLDER RULER BY THE WAY TO PUT A RULER PHYSIC FILL RULER LITTLER THE CORK BACK
gb3dLfgPH0I_21 KEEPS IT FROM SLIDING
gb3dLfgPH0I_22 AND IT'S ALSO UP A LITTLE BIT FROM THE PAPER SO THAT TELL IF YOUR LINING UP WITH INK YOU'RE NOT GONNA RUN THE RISK OF OUR SMUDGING QUITE AS READILY

gzHnaTpBgv4_1 SOME OF THE COMMON MISTAKES THAT PEOPLE MAKE A LOT OF LEARNING HOW TO FAKIE HEEL FLIP ARE USUALLY JUST BEING COMFORTABLE ROLLING FAKIE POSITION
gzHnaTpBgv4_2 YOU DON'T SPEND AS MUCH TIME ROLLING FAKIE AS YOU WOULD FOR SUMMER PLIERS OF LITTLE MORE THOUGHT TO BE PREPARED TO ROLL FAKIE
gzHnaTpBgv4_3 ONE OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE USUALLY HAVE USE THEY DON'T PUT ENOUGH WEIGHT OVER THE FRONT OF THE BOARD
gzHnaTpBgv4_4 WHAT THIS DOES IS IT REPLACES THE THE MOMENTS OF THAT YOU FEEL WHEN YOU'RE HEADED FLOORS THE TAIL
gzHnaTpBgv4_5 WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS LEAN WHAT YOU DO THE FAKIE OLLIE BEING FORWARD TO COMPENSATE AND BALANCE OUT THE TRACK
gzHnaTpBgv4_6 BUT PEOPLE USUALLY DON'T IT WITH WATER ROLLING BACKWARDS THATS ENDS UP BEING BACK THIS WAY ONCE THEY'VE ALL WIDTH AND HEEL FLIP AND KEEP GOING IN THIS POSITION
gzHnaTpBgv4_7 WHICH IN ONE AND TWO TO FIX THAT IS IF ONE IS SETUP AND HEEL FLIP POSITION AND HIT THE TAIL AND AND REPLACE THE WEIGHT ON THE FRONT SIDE OF IT SO THAT ARE WAY IS BALANCE EVEN LEAF AND IT ENDS UP FLIPPING STRAIGHT AND YOU'RE ABLE TO AWAY
gzHnaTpBgv4_8 ANOTHER THOUGHT THAT YOU MAY HAVE LEARNING FEET HEEL FLIPS IS THAT IT JUST DOESN'T SLIP ENOUGH
gzHnaTpBgv4_9 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO THAT IS TO POSSIBLY ADJUST YOUR FOOT PLACEMENT OF WHITE PAINT YOU TELL THEM OR OFF THE BOARD
gzHnaTpBgv4_10 IT'S A VERY COMMON MISTAKE
gzHnaTpBgv4_11 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS JUST TEST WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU AT THIS THE PITCHER ROLLING
gzHnaTpBgv4_12 YOUR BACK FOOT ON THE BACK CORNER OF YOUR FOOT OVER HERE THAT'S HOW YOU THAT ONCE THE HEELS LENGTH AND THE FALL TEETH AND THEN FROM A <UNK> CHORD SO THAT YOU DON'T NEED TOO FAR BACK AND THICK AND HAVE IT LANDS UNDERNEATH IT AND THAT'LL HELP YOU LEARN HOW TO HEEL FLIP FADE

ggx79z62v60_10 THESE WORK REALLY WELL ONCE YOU GET INTO THE LIGHT TWELVE TO FOURTEEN INSIDE STAKES
ggx79z62v60_11 THAT SOME OF THE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF STATE SHE CAN USE
ggx79z62v60_12 YOU CAN EASILY REPAIR YOUR STAKES ODD DUCK TAPING THEM OR YOU CAN GO IN AND IS ON THE HARDWOOD SHARPEN ONE END OF IT AND USE THAT AS A STATE THAT'S EASY REPLACEMENT

GncdILTVo-o_2 ON OR THE PREVIOUS SEGMENTS I TAUGHT SOMETHING CALLED HINDU SHUFFLE
GncdILTVo-o_3 I WILL GIVE YOU A QUICK REVIEW OF THAT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY GOOD SHUFFLE TO USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE STRIPPER DECK
GncdILTVo-o_4 BASICALLY YOU HOLD THE CARDS
GncdILTVo-o_5 I'M HOLDING THEM IN MY MIDDLE FINGER AND DOWN
GncdILTVo-o_6 WE'RE IN A PEEL OFF SMALL SECTIONS OF CARDS AND DROP THEM LIKE THIS
GncdILTVo-o_7 THAT'S THE HINDU SHUFFLE
GncdILTVo-o_8 AT REGULAR SPEED IT LOOKS LIKE THIS
GncdILTVo-o_9 I HAD TO SHOW YOU FROM THE SIDE
GncdILTVo-o_10 NOW THE REASON THIS IS GOOD WITHIN HIM STRIPPER DECK IS THAT THERE WILL BE TIMES WHEN YOU BE ABLE TO STRIP THE CARD RIGHT OUT AND PUT IT ON TOP OF THE DECK BECAUSE IT'S BEEN REVERSED
GncdILTVo-o_11 THAT'S A BASIC REVIEW OF THE HINDU SHUFFLE
GncdILTVo-o_12 AND LATER ON WHEN A SHOW YOU HOW YOU APPLY THAT TO THE STRIPPER OR TAPER DECK TO DO SOME TRICKS WITH IT
H0irdM-yLKM_1 IN THIS EXAMPLE AND ANOTHER WRITTEN AND WHEN IT IS LIKE A LITTLE LAW MINOR PULL OFF WITH THE REF END VALUE IN SOMEWHAT LIKE ANOTHER COUPLE OFF CAMERA IDEA THAT YOU CAN USE IN BETWEEN CHORDS
H0irdM-yLKM_2 AND WITH THE DRUMS IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS
H0irdM-yLKM_3 IF SO OUT WITH THAT I'M ACTUALLY USE A KNOT NOTES OF THE D MINOR SCALE
H0irdM-yLKM_4 AND IF YOU NOTICE I PLAYED A D MINOR CHORD IF AND WITH THE A FIVE
H0irdM-yLKM_5 SONG OR IF IT ACTUALLY PLAY A MINOR OFF
H0irdM-yLKM_6 IF WE IT'S AN EXCEPTION TO MAKE IS THIS NOTE HAS A SHELF NORMALLY IT MINUTE WITH THE KEY OF F BUT IN THE KEY OF B MINOR KNIFE
H0irdM-yLKM_7 SLOW AND THEM AGAIN AGAIN GIVES A NICE MINOR FLAVOR THAT YOU CAN PLAY WITH THE A BASED REF OUT OF ANOTHER KEY
H0irdM-yLKM_8 SO THAT THE GIVEN I GET THE ERRATICALLY WHICH IN NEW MUSIC THEORY ONE
H0irdM-yLKM_9 AND IF THAT HAS A NICE MINOR SOUND SO IT GIVES A NICE DARK TONALITY FREE ROW

gHdm6TMzeJU_1 IF THE PATIENTS DIAGNOSE FROM GUM DISEASE THERE'S A MULTITUDE OF WAYS TO TREAT THIS GUM DISEASE
gHdm6TMzeJU_2 OUT THE CLIP THE MOST TYPICAL ONE THE DENSE FROM PRESCRIBE OR WHAT'S CALLED SCALING IN ROUX PLANNING ALSO KNOWN AS DEEP CLEANINGS
gHdm6TMzeJU_3 THE PURPOSE OF THE D CLINGS OR TO BASICALLY REMOVE ALL DEBRIS AND BUILD UP THAT OCCURS ABOVE AND BELOW THE GUM LINE AND THE TEA
gHdm6TMzeJU_4 WE KNOW THAT IS ALL TO ONLY THE PROBLEM WHICH WOULD CONTRIBUTES TO THE TO THE GUM DISEASE SUCH AS GINGER VIGUS BONE LAST TEACHING LOST IN LOOSE
gHdm6TMzeJU_5 COME AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WHEN WE DO THESE DEEP CLEANINGS THAT WE GO IN THERE AND REMOVE ALL OF THE IRRITATING FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS GUM DISEASE
gHdm6TMzeJU_6 SO IN THIS MODEL WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF THIS TO THAT ACTUALLY HAS GUM DISEASE IN WOULD CHARACTERIZE GUM DISEASE BY A COUPLE THINGS
gHdm6TMzeJU_7 ONE IS THAT WE HAVE LOTS OF BUILD UP DOWN RIGHT HERE ON THE GUM LINE
gHdm6TMzeJU_8 SECONDLY THE TISSUE IS VERY RED INFLAMED IN TENDER AND ALSO BELIEVE DELIBERATE MORE FREQUENTLY THAN NORMAL
gHdm6TMzeJU_9 WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IT ONLY DO OR DO CLINGS AS WE'RE MOVING ALL OF THESE IS BUILT UP AROUND THE TEETH
gHdm6TMzeJU_10 SO AND IT'S A BUBBLE APPOINTMENT PATIENT WILL COME THEN THE DENTIST WILL NUMB THE PATIENT TO MAKE UNCOMFORTABLE
gHdm6TMzeJU_11 AND TYPICALLY THE HIGH GYMNAST WILL BE THE ONE THE PERFORMS THE D CLINGS
gHdm6TMzeJU_12 IN A D CLEANING WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS OR TAKING SEVERAL DIFFERENT CLEANING INSTRUMENTS AND PLACING AND ACROSS THE TOOTH WHERE THE BULLET AS AND REMOVING THE BUILT
gHdm6TMzeJU_13 SO HERE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THIS BUILD UP AS WE TAKE YOUR INSTRUMENT THROUGH HERE WE ARE IN AND GENTLY PULL SOME THIS MATERIAL OFF THE TOOTH JUST LIKE SO AND CANVAS IN A LIGHT SCRAPING MOTION WE'RE MOVING ALL THIS BALL UP AROUND THE TEETH
gHdm6TMzeJU_14 BY REMOVING THE BUILD UP THAT WILL HELP CURE IN THE GUM DISEASE AND GET THE TISSUE AND WILL MORE STABLE UNCOMFORTABLE CONDITION LIKE SO
gHdm6TMzeJU_15 ONCE THE D CLEANS OF BEEN COMPLETED WE WILL BASE OF THE BRING THE PATIENT BACK ROUGHLY ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS LATER AFTER THE TRIGGER HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND WILL RE EVALUATE THE GUMS
gHdm6TMzeJU_16 THE THINGS THAT WE LOOK AT OUR THE TISSUE COLOR IS IT HAS THE TISSUE NICE AND PINK OR IS IT STILL RED
gHdm6TMzeJU_17 IS IT NICE AND TIGHT CORE IS INFLAMED AND SWOLLEN
gHdm6TMzeJU_18 AND HOW MUCH BLEEDING THE WE HAVE
gHdm6TMzeJU_19 AS THE BLEEDING DECREASES WE INITIALLY EVALUATED
gHdm6TMzeJU_20 PROVIDED ALL THOSE THINGS HAVE OR IMPROVED RESPOND AND THEN THE AS THE FIRST STEPS IN TRAINING THE GUM DISEASE
gHdm6TMzeJU_21 ONCE WE'VE IDENTIFY THAT WE HAVE THAT A STABLE CONDITION THE NEXT STEP IS TO GET THE PATIENT IN A MORE FREQUENT RECALL INTERVAL WHETHER GETTING MORE FREQUENT CLEANINGS
gHdm6TMzeJU_22 THIS CAN BE IS AS MUCH AS EVERY THREE MONTHS TO AS LITTLE AS EVERY SIX MONTHS AND IT DEPENDS FROM PATIENT PATIENT BASED ON HOW MUCH TREATMENT WE THINK WILL BE NECESSARY

HATpkbud9m8_5 YOUR GOING TO NEED TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT INTO
HATpkbud9m8_6 SO WHEN YOU'RE IN A GROUP PLANT HERE ARE SOME TOOLS THAT YOU'LL NEED A PAIR OF SCISSORS SOME SORT OF CLAW TOO HEAVY WEIGHT OFF OF THEIR OF THE PLANT IF THERE'S A LOT OF DIRT CAKED ON AND A LITTLE FEATHER DUSTER BECAUSE SOMETIMES IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF PLANTS IN THEIR INDOORS ESPECIALLY IN THERE IF THEY'RE IN A PUBLIC PLACE THEM AND GET A LOT OF DUST ALL OVER THEM

GyXb5y1Cuas_3 INTAGLIO WE RELY ON WILL FILL BLANKETS TRANSFERRED ENERGY FROM THE DRUM TO OUR PRINTING MATRIX
GyXb5y1Cuas_4 THERE'S THREE FELTS
GyXb5y1Cuas_5 THIS IS OR STARCH CATCHER AND THIS IS IN A TAKING AN EXTRA MOISTURE FROM THE PAPER AS A SECTION PRINTED IN ITS ON BOTTOM
GyXb5y1Cuas_6 THE SECOND MAJOR PRESSURE FELT AND IT'S ACTUALLY IS A BIT THICKER THAN THE OTHER ONES AND IT'S IN A ALLOW THAT PAPER TO BE MOLDED DOWN INTO THE MATRIX AND PULL OUT THE INK
GyXb5y1Cuas_7 AND LAST FELTS MAJOR PUSHER FELT ON THIS ONE ACTUALLY GOES UP AGAINST THE DRUMS AND TAKE THE BEADING FROM THE DRUM
GyXb5y1Cuas_8 IT'S A REAL BEATING THAT
GyXb5y1Cuas_9 IT'S WOVEN SO IT'S A LITTLE STURDIER THAN THE OTHER FILLS
GyXb5y1Cuas_10 AND WHEN SETTING UP THE FELTS YOU WANNA STAGGER THEM LIKE SO
GyXb5y1Cuas_11 IF YOU HAD HIM ALL SCRAP COVERAGE OTHER TO HIT THAT HIT THE DRUM AND IT WOULDN'T GO ONE AND THEY'RE JUST KEEP PUSHING THE FELT THAT
GyXb5y1Cuas_12 ONE THING I LIKE TO DO WHEN PRINTING IS G THE FELT SLOUGHED INTO THEM UNDER THE DRUM
GyXb5y1Cuas_13 THIS DOES OF A COUPLE THINGS
GyXb5y1Cuas_14 WITHOUT ROUTER FLOATS STAGGERED BUT THE MONTH TO THE DRUM KIT AND RUN THEM THROUGH TO IT JUST SO THERE ARE HANGING IN AND KNOCK IT ALONG AND COME BACK OUT
GyXb5y1Cuas_15 WHAT THIS DOES THAT LOCKS THEM AND THEN IT FEEDS THEM FROM PUSHING IT BACK ON YOUR CURRENT

H0JD_OtYloQ_1 THERE ARE MANY OPTIONS FOR LITTER BOXES FOR KITTENS
H0JD_OtYloQ_2 AS THE KITTENS ARE OF QUITE YOUNG IN JUST LEARNING TO USE A LITTER BOX I RECOMMEND THE SORT OF FLAT TRY A LITTLE TOUGH SAYS
H0JD_OtYloQ_3 SIMILAR TO THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT MEAT COMES IN THE GROCERY STORE
H0JD_OtYloQ_4 ANY CAN PUT A SMALL AMOUNT OF LITTER OF MAYBE A LITTLE MORE THAN THIS ON AND THAT WAY THE KITTENS CAN JUST GET IN THERE AND THEY CAN LEARN TO OF FEEL THE TEXTURE OF IT SCRATCH AROUND BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY JUMP INCLINE IN
H0JD_OtYloQ_5 WE ARE OUT WITHERED YOUNG AND THEY'RE NOT THAT WELL COORDINATED YOU ONE MAKE SURE THAT IT'S EASY FOR THEM TO GET IN AND OUT OF A LITTER BOX
H0JD_OtYloQ_6 SEE IF THIS LITTLE GIRL <UNK> GO OUT FOR US
H0JD_OtYloQ_7 WE'RE GONNA <UNK> TRADE TO THIS ONE
H0JD_OtYloQ_8 THIS IS ALSO A LITTLE BIT OLDER KITTEN WOULD DO BETTER WITH THIS TYPE OF A LITTER BOX
H0JD_OtYloQ_9 IT'S A LITTLE BIT HIGHER ON THE SIDED SO THAT THEY DON'T KICK LITTER AROUND
H0JD_OtYloQ_10 PROBABLY A FIVE OR SIX WEIKLE KITTEN WILL LIKE THAT
H0JD_OtYloQ_11 A FEW YEARS KITTEN DOESN'T LIKE A VERY MUCH
H0JD_OtYloQ_12 AND THEN AS THEY GET OLDER AND THEY'RE ABLE TO JUMP IN AND OUT THEY CAN USE A FULL SIDED LITTER BOX
H0JD_OtYloQ_13 KITTENS TEND TO PLAY A LOT IN THEIR LITTER SO YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT TOO MUCH LATER IN THE BOX KEEP IT KIND OF THIN
H0JD_OtYloQ_14 IN AND OUT IF THE HEIGHT OF THE HIGH SIZE WILL KEEP THEM FROM KICKING LITTER ALL AROUND
H0JD_OtYloQ_15 BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THIS BOX IS IS BECAUSE THIS KITTENS A WOULDN'T BE APPROPRIATE FOR THIS AGE OF THE KEY
GIsAEvpCRRM_1 ONE QUESTION I GET ASKED WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KIDS IN CAR PRACTICE
GIsAEvpCRRM_2 WHITE IS A CHILD KNEADING IT CHIROPRACTIC CARE
GIsAEvpCRRM_3 THEY DON'T HURT OR THEY'LL HAVE PROB
GIsAEvpCRRM_4 THE OF LOW BACK PAIN ON NECK PAIN
GIsAEvpCRRM_5 SO WHY IT IS IT'S HOW THE CHIROPRACTIC CARE
GIsAEvpCRRM_6 WELL IF WE LOOK BACK TO THE BIRDING PROCESS
GIsAEvpCRRM_7 WE KNOW THAT A BABY COMES FROM BEING ANY WARM ENVIRONMENT FOR NINE MONTHS
GIsAEvpCRRM_8 ALL SUDDEN HAS TO GET FORCED THROUGH A LITTLE OPENING IT REALLY DOESN'T FIT THROUGH
GIsAEvpCRRM_9 AS A HEAD START TO COME OUT THE DOCTOR NOW CAN GRAB HOLD THE HEAD
GIsAEvpCRRM_10 IS THAT IS IT ACTUALLY SHOWN THAT THE DOCTOR'S PULLED ABOUT OF FORCE ABOUT NINETY POUNDS OF PRESSURE
GIsAEvpCRRM_11 NOW THAT'S NOTHING TO FALL THE DOCTOR
GIsAEvpCRRM_12 BUT THAT'S JUST WHAT'S HAPPENING
GIsAEvpCRRM_13 THAT'S HOW THEY HELP AND THIS IS THE BURNING PROCESS
GIsAEvpCRRM_14 I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I'M NOT SURE I WANT MY CHILD HEAD TO THE POLE
GIsAEvpCRRM_15 THE NINETY POUNDS OF PRESSURE WITH A CHILD CANNOT HOLDER HAD A YET
GIsAEvpCRRM_16 OR CANNOT MOVE AROUND LIKE THIS AND PUT LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO DOWN THE ROAD
GIsAEvpCRRM_17 SO IF ONE WAY THAT THAT SPAWN ACCOUNT BECOME CAN BECOME MISALIGNED IS TO THE BREATHING PROCESS ITSELF
GIsAEvpCRRM_18 IS GOING TO SMALL OPENING
GIsAEvpCRRM_19 AND THEN AS A DOCTOR ASSIST THE BABY AS IT COMES OUT INTO THE WORLD

GAzwixKTOBc_1 HI I'M MIKE LAIS
GAzwixKTOBc_2 AND ON BEHALF OF EXPERT VILLAGE THIS IS PLAYING PIANO SEVENTH CHORDS
GAzwixKTOBc_3 NOW WE HAVE A DOMINANT CHORD
GAzwixKTOBc_4 LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER INVERSIONS OF IT THAT WE CAN DO
GAzwixKTOBc_5 FOR EXAMPLE THE FIRST INVERSION WHICH IS OVER AND TALK ABOUT HERE IS OUR WE SPELL OUT FROM THE THIRD OF THE CHORD A AS OPPOSED TO THE ROOT OF THE COURT
GAzwixKTOBc_6 SO WHEN I GO HERE
GAzwixKTOBc_7 WE'LL TAKE OUR C DOMINANT SEVEN AGAIN WHICH IS ONE THREE FIVE YEARS FLAT SEVEN OVER IN AND DO THE A FIRST INVERSION OF THIS WHICH WE'RE BASICALLY STARTING OFF ON THE ROOT AND JUST TAKEN OUR WORT STARTING OFF ON THE THIRD AND TAKING THE ROOM RING AND UP THE OCTAVE
GAzwixKTOBc_9 IT'S OVER AND GO FIRST INVERSION THE SPELLED THREE BOOM LIVE BOOM FLAT SEVEN TO EIGHT ONE OF THE ERA
GAzwixKTOBc_10 ISN'T THAT
GAzwixKTOBc_11 AND TO BE YOUR FIRST INVERSION OF A DOMINANT SEVENTH CHORD
Gq5mCJmXdco_1 HERE I'LL BE DISCUSSING THE DOING THE
Gq5mCJmXdco_2 AND THIS INSTRUMENT HAS MANY DIFFERENT NAMES AND OUR BLUE GO BEING ANOTHER ONE OF THEM
Gq5mCJmXdco_3 BUT ESSENTIALLY THE CONSTRUCTION IS THE SAME
Gq5mCJmXdco_4 IT'S A MIDDLE EASTERN DRUM VERY COMMON IN ETHIOPIA IN HUGE IT
Gq5mCJmXdco_5 A BUT THE UPPER EDGE CHANGES SO IN SOME OF LIGHT EASTERN YOUR COUNTRIES ON FOUR IN TURKEY FOR EXAMPLE THE RAMBLE THE METAL
Gq5mCJmXdco_6 RATHER THAN THE EGYPTIAN VERSION OF THIS WHICH WILL HAVE A CURVED EDGE
Gq5mCJmXdco_7 CREATING A DIFFERENT SOUND AS YOU APPROACH THE EDGE OF THIS END OF THE INSTRUMENT
Gq5mCJmXdco_8 THE SKI OF FIZZ WITHHOLD HIGH ACROSS HERE
Gq5mCJmXdco_9 OFTEN MADE WITH ANIMALS IN ESPECIALLY BEFORE THEY HAVE SYNTHETIC SKINS HERE
Gq5mCJmXdco_10 THIS CASES METAL
Gq5mCJmXdco_11 SOMETIMES IT'LL BE CERAMIC OR CLAY EVEN
Gq5mCJmXdco_12 NOW THE BOTTOM IS HOLLOW ENDS THE REASON FOR THAT IS NOT ONLY SLIP THE SOUND COMING OUT OF THE INSTRUMENT BUT AS YOU STRIKE THE INSTRUMENT IF YOU INSERT YOUR HAND INTO THE BOTTOM YOU CAN CHANGE THE TONE OF THE DRUM
Gq5mCJmXdco_13 SO THE I'M WITH THE WITH THE BREATH IN AS IT GETS LOWERS I BRING THE HAND IN THERE CHANGING THE FREQUENCY OF THE SOUND COMING UP
Gq5mCJmXdco_14 NOW THE NAME DOING BACK ESSENTIALLY COMES FROM A TWO SOUNDS YOU CAN GET FROM INSTRUMENT
Gq5mCJmXdco_15 I'M DOING WHICH IS THE WE HIT IN THE CENTER OF THE INSTRUMENT IN AND THE LOW SOUND
Gq5mCJmXdco_16 AND THE O TACK OR THAT IN THIS CASE WHEN YOU'RE HITTING THE ENGE OF THE RIM EDGE OF THE SKIN GO GET THAT VERY CHRIS SEN
GaHNvEqJyF4_1 WE'LL TALK ABOUT SAKE DIVING DISTANCE BETWEEN OTHER AUTOMOBILES AND INCLEMENT WEATHER YOU WANNA STAY AT LEAST TWO VEHICLES OR A VEHICLE AND HAVE BEHIND THE OTHER CAR I AT YOU
GaHNvEqJyF4_2 IN THE EVENT THAT HE DOES SOMETHING ERRATIC YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO STOP
GaHNvEqJyF4_3 AND DURING INCLEMENT WEATHER SUCH AS RANGE SNOW SLIDERS WILL ON THE AT LEAST FIVE MILES BELOW THE REGULAR SPEED LIMIT

hAZ1s7unT5g_1 HI MY NAME IS REBECCA ON HIM AND TALK ABOUT HOW TO BECOME A FASHION DESIGNER
hAZ1s7unT5g_2 THERE TO US TO DOING IT
hAZ1s7unT5g_3 THE FIRST ONE QUITE OBVIOUSLY IS THE STUDY FASHION DESIGN IN A SCHOOL THAT HAS THAT AS A DISCIPLINE
hAZ1s7unT5g_4 THE OTHER WAY WORKS FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TO
hAZ1s7unT5g_5 IT'S TO JUST START
hAZ1s7unT5g_6 ONE WAY IS JUST TO GET ANY JOB AND THE FASHION INDUSTRY
hAZ1s7unT5g_7 YOU COULD BE MANAGING THE SAMPLE ROOM FOR A FASHION HOUSE OR EVEN A SMALLER BRAND
hAZ1s7unT5g_8 OR YOU COULD BE AN ASSISTANT TO A DESIGNER SO WHY YOU MIGHT NOT BE DOING FASHIONS THAT YOU RE LEARNING ALL ABOUT THE FASHION INDUSTRY
hAZ1s7unT5g_9 THE OTHER WAY IS TO JUST START YOUR OWN COMPANY
hAZ1s7unT5g_10 YES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BUT IF YOU FOCUS ON VERY VERY LIMITED ITEMS IN THE BEGINNING MAYBE FIVE OR LAST AND JUST MAKE THAT WORK YOU CAN GROW ACCOMPANY FROM THERE
hAZ1s7unT5g_11 ANOTHER THING TO DO TO GET EXPERIENCE WITH THE YOU'RE ENTERING THE FIELD JUST OUT OF STUDYING OR WITH THE YOU WANT TO ADVANCE FROM SOMETHING LIKE A DESIGN A FIZZ THEN INTO MY MORE RESPONSIBLE AND CREATIVE POSITION IS TO DO PROJECTS FOR COMPANIES
hAZ1s7unT5g_12 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ON FULL TIME
hAZ1s7unT5g_13 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PAID
hAZ1s7unT5g_14 YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND COMPANIES THAT ARE WILLING TO WORK REVIEW AND PROJECTS YOU'D LIKE TO DO IN ORDER TO RAISE YOUR EXPERIENCE LEVEL
hAZ1s7unT5g_15 ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING IN BECOMING A FASHION DESIGNER IS TO ALWAYS BE DEVELOPING IMPROVING YOUR SKILL LEVEL
hAZ1s7unT5g_16 THAT MEANS KNOWING ALL THE LATEST PROGRAMS ON A COMPUTER AS WELL AS HAVING THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL TO DO THE SEWING IN THE PATTERN MAKING EVEN IF YOU NOT CAN BE DOING THAT IN THE WOOD FLOORS
hAZ1s7unT5g_17 SO THOSE ARE A FEW THINGS TO THINK ABOUT WHEN CHOOSING A CAREER IN FASHION DESIGN

G55W2Zl2sxw_1 IN CHINESE MEDICINE BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT FLAVORS AND HOW THE ASSOCIATE WITH THE ORGANS AND SWEET BEING THE MAIN FLAVOR THAT AFFECTS THE ENERGETICS BLING IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW SWEETENERS MAY AFFECT
G55W2Zl2sxw_2 SO WE DON'T WANT TOO MUCH TOO STRONG OUT AND WE DON'T WANT TO LITTLE OF ANYTHING
G55W2Zl2sxw_3 SO WE CUT ABOUT NATURAL SWEETENERS IN WHAT MAY BE THE BEST
G55W2Zl2sxw_4 IN ACTUALITY IN CHINESE MEDICINE ANYTHING THAT'S EXTRACTED AND INTENSIFIED IN SWEETNESS REALLY ISN'T THE BEST THING FOR IT
G55W2Zl2sxw_5 SO THERE'S DEBATE AS TO WHETHER THE BROWN SUGAR OR THE WHITE SUGAR OR WHETHER THE CACTUS SUGAR OR EVEN OUT THE ARTIFICIAL STARTED THE NATURAL SWEETENERS LIKE STADIA HOW THEY MAY AFFECT US
G55W2Zl2sxw_6 ULTIMATELY IF THEY'RE VERY VERY SWEET AND EVEN MORE SWEEPING SUGAR WE FIND THAT IT'S DETRIMENTAL OVER TIME
G55W2Zl2sxw_7 SO FROM A CHINESE PERSPECTIVE WE WANNA MINIMIZE ARE SWEETENERS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO OVER TO REACT ON THE SPLEEN CAUSING A DYSFUNCTION THAT SHE AND ULTIMATELY HURTING ARE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND OUR DIGESTIVE FUNCTION
G55W2Zl2sxw_8 BUT FROM A MORE PRACTICAL STANDPOINT WE DO LIKE OR SWEETENERS IN SO IN GENERAL I RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE USE DAVE YET IN PARTICULAR FROM A NATURAL PERSPECTIVE ROLL THE PLANTER SELF AND USE THE FRESH LEAF
G55W2Zl2sxw_9 THE MORE THAT WE EXTRACT THINGS MORLEY REFINED THEM THE LESS NUTRIENTS AND THE GREAT OF THE POTENTIAL FOR HARM BOTH FROM AN ENERGETIC PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS A TRUE PERSPECTIVE OF EXPECTED CHEMICALS

G4p6QqGMUkA_5 I WORK WITH COLLAGING LIGHTS
G4p6QqGMUkA_6 SO YOU REALLY FOCUS DOWN WITH A LIGHT
G4p6QqGMUkA_7 AND THERE IS A PRODUCT THAT I USUALLY PUT ON THAT MAKES THOSE HAIRS
G4p6QqGMUkA_8 IT'S CALLED POOR MARKER

G4p6QqGMUkA_28 I ALL ASSESS IT AND THEN I'LL DO RECOMMENDATIONS WITH THE FLY
h0HsjGpBr8s_2 MY NAME'S YOLANDA VANVEEN AND IN THIS SEGMENT WE'RE IN A LEARN ALL ABOUT HOW TO BECOME A MASTER GARDENER
h0HsjGpBr8s_3 I BECAME A MASTER GARDENER INTO THOUSAND IN FOUR AND IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING AND ENTERTAINING AND ALSO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ARE THINK OF EVER EXPERIENCE
h0HsjGpBr8s_4 AND NOT ONLY WAS IT FUN TO LEARN ABOUT THE PLANTS I LEARNED SO MUCH MORE
h0HsjGpBr8s_5 I LEARNED ALL ABOUT BUGS AND TREES AND SOILS AND TRANSPLANTING AND IT WAS JUST A REALLY A REALLY EXCITING EXPERIENCE
h0HsjGpBr8s_6 NOW HOW DO YOU BECOME A MASTER GARNER
h0HsjGpBr8s_7 PEOPLE AT SNELL A TIME
h0HsjGpBr8s_8 AND IT'S REALLY EASY
h0HsjGpBr8s_9 SO IT'S AN A GARDEN SHOW AND THERE IS A MASTER GARDENERS AND THEY WERE IN THE BOOTH AND THEY HAVE SOME FLYERS ON HOW TO BECOME A MASTER GARTNER
h0HsjGpBr8s_10 SO THE MASTER GARDENING PROGRAM IS SPONSORED BY YOUR LOCAL STATES EXTENSION SERVICE
h0HsjGpBr8s_11 SO THE WASHINGTON STAY PROGRAM IS RUN TO THE WASHED IN STATE UNIVERSITY CO-OPERATIVE EXTENSION
h0HsjGpBr8s_12 AND SO THEY HAVE ALL KINDS INFORMATION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OR YOU CAN GO TO THE LOCAL STATE UNIVERSITY IN AFTER ROUNDER DOES GO WILL YOUR COUNTY AND MASTER GARDENER'S IN USUALLY INFORMATIONAL COME RIGHT UP
h0HsjGpBr8s_13 THE PROGRAMS ARE USUALLY HELD ONCE A YEAR ERR ONCE EVERY TWO YEARS
h0HsjGpBr8s_14 AND AT THAT IT WOULD BE MORE OF THE TIME COMMITMENT BUT IT REALLY WASN'T THAT BAG
h0HsjGpBr8s_15 IT WAS IS ONCE A WEEK ONE DAY
h0HsjGpBr8s_16 I PROGRAM WAS ON THURSDAYS
h0HsjGpBr8s_17 SOME ARE ON SATURDAYS
h0HsjGpBr8s_18 IMMUNE CLASSES IS LIKE GOING TO COLLEGE FROM ABOUT NINE TO THREE OR FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON
h0HsjGpBr8s_19 AND EACH DAY YOU LEARN ALL DIFFERENT SUBJECTS
h0HsjGpBr8s_20 AND YOU'RE ON A SET SCHEDULE AND YOU HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE COME IN SPEAK TO YOU AND IT'S VERY VERY INTERESTING
h0HsjGpBr8s_21 THE CLASSES OR FOR ONLY ABOUT TWO TO THREE MONTHS SO IT REALLY WAS A MELODIC CLASSES IN THE END
h0HsjGpBr8s_22 AND ONCE YOU FINISH A CLASSES YOU GET CERTIFIED AND THEN YOU CAN REPRESENTS THE WASH MISTING UNIVERSITY MASTER GARDENING PROGRAM AND DIFFERENT FARMERS MARKET SEND IN THE EXTENSION SERVICE OFFICES
h0HsjGpBr8s_23 SO THE MAIN REASON THAT THESE ARE THE WHOLE PROGRAM AND WASH THAN STATE WAS SO THAT THE EXTENSION SERVICE THE DEPARTMENT OF BAG THAT HAVE HELP IS ONLY PEOPLE CALLING WITH GARDENING QUESTIONS
h0HsjGpBr8s_24 IT'S A THE SET UP THE MASTER BURNING PROGRAMS THAT PEOPLE CAN VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME AND HELP OTHERS
h0HsjGpBr8s_25 AND IT WORKS OUT FOR EVERYONE
h0HsjGpBr8s_26 THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT I LEARNED WAS HOW TO RESEARCH INFORMATION 'CAUSE THERE'S REALLY NO RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWERS WHEN IT COMES WHEN THERE'S GUARDING QUESTIONS
h0HsjGpBr8s_27 AND PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES
h0HsjGpBr8s_28 AND SO THERE IS A SET MANUAL THAT THEY PROVIDE FOR YOU THAT I REFER TO ALL THE TIME
h0HsjGpBr8s_29 AND IN THE PROGRAM IS A SLIGHT COLLEGE
h0HsjGpBr8s_30 ANY JUST GO THROUGH EACH OF THE SUBJECT
h0HsjGpBr8s_31 IT'S LIKE A MINI HORTICULTURAL DEGREE
h0HsjGpBr8s_32 AND BOUGHT THE BASIC SOILS IN FERTILIZERS PLANT PROPAGATION IF PRUNING WHICH I REALLY REFER TO IT
h0HsjGpBr8s_33 AN ALL TYPES OF OTHER INFORMATION
h0HsjGpBr8s_34 HOW TO PLANT FOLDS
h0HsjGpBr8s_35 HOW DID IT TAKE YOUR VERY JESUS BUGS ETYMOLOGY WAS THAT A LOT OF TIME ON BUGS BECAUSE THAT IS AN IMPORTANT OR GARDENING IS TO UNDERSTANDING HOW TO DO WITH THE WILD LEVERAGE
h0HsjGpBr8s_36 IF NOT EASIER THAN COLLAGED HERE
h0HsjGpBr8s_37 I WAS REALLY FEEL TO FIND OUT THERE'S NO HAS IN CLASS
h0HsjGpBr8s_38 YOU JUST TAKE A MANUAL HOME AND YOU HAVE A LIST OF QUESTIONS EACH BEAT AND YOU CAN REFER TO BOOK IS THAT'S WHICH ARE LEARNING
h0HsjGpBr8s_39 YOU'RE LEARNING HOW TO DO RESEARCH THAT I REALLY THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF LEARNING IS LEARNING TO FROM OTHERS
h0HsjGpBr8s_40 AND SO YOU JUST RIGHT EXACTLY WHERE YOU GOT YOUR REFERENCE CAN WHAT YOUR ANSWER IS AND THEN YOU TUNE PAPERWORK AND I AM IN THE GIVE A BACK HERE
h0HsjGpBr8s_41 AND THE BEST PART IS IS WHEN YOU GET A FILE EFFACEMENT IN ALL OF THE QUESTIONS RIGHT
h0HsjGpBr8s_42 WHAT SHOULD GRADUATE FROM THE MASTER GARDENER DEGREE PROGRAM THEN YOU NEED TO PUT IN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS INVOLUNTARY
h0HsjGpBr8s_43 SEE CAN VOLUNTEER OF THE CLINIC OR ARE TEACHING OTHERS ABOUT GARDENING OR IN THE LOCAL SCHOOLS WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO
h0HsjGpBr8s_44 THEY ALL TYPES OF PROGRAMS
h0HsjGpBr8s_45 AND ONCE YOU HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS AND GET YOUR BACKYARD
h0HsjGpBr8s_46 TO GET YOUR BAD IN TO REPRESENT THE MASTER GARNERS YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP YOUR VOLUNTEER TIME AND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT'S HARD
h0HsjGpBr8s_47 BUT IT IS SO REWARDING TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE HELPING OTHERS AND IT IS A REALLY GOOD USE OF YOUR TIME
h0HsjGpBr8s_48 AND IT'S GREAT TO KNOW ABOUT GARDENING AND THE SHIRT WITH OTHERS
guCbqRafvKE_1 NO TREES OR IT RUNS OUT REALLY IT

GVU_CndU8qU_4 SO WE'RE IN AND TAKE A COLOR AND IT CAN BE ANY COLOR THAT YOU WANT THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE ENOUGH TO MAKE SIMILAR LOGS ABOUT THE SAME SIZE IN YOU NEED TO MAKE ABOUT FIVE
GVU_CndU8qU_5 ONE AND IN THREE WHO FIVE OF HALF
GVU_CndU8qU_7 FOR IN A ROLL EACH ONE OF THESE THINGS TO INDIVIDUAL LOGS THE POINT TO ATTACH THEN
GVU_CndU8qU_8 YOU CAN SEE HAVE IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A FLOWER
GVU_CndU8qU_9 IT'LL LOOK MORE LIKE A FLOWER WHEN IT'S ALL COMPLETING WORLD
GVU_CndU8qU_10 SO IT'S A GOOD COLOR THAT'S VERY CONTRAST THING FROM THIS FOCAL
GVU_CndU8qU_11 WE DON'T WANT TO USE SOMETHING THAT'S ALMOST LIKE THE PURPLE BECAUSE YOU REALLY WANT THE PEDALS TO STICK OUT AND SHOW
GVU_CndU8qU_12 THE ONLY USE THIS BRIGHT YELLOW RIGHT HERE

gNEb3wpOYhI_1 SO A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T GET INVOLVED WITH SEEDS SAVING BECAUSE THAT CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF CROSS POLLINATION OR THE THING THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE IF YOU WERE SEED
gNEb3wpOYhI_2 AN WELL PEOPLE USE TO GO INTO THE STORE OR TRUSTING THE OTHER I'M IF FORTIES FOR THEIR FOR THEIR OF MATERIALS AND RESOURCES
gNEb3wpOYhI_3 HOWEVER I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT TODAY THAT YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO BE SO CONCERN ESPECIALLY IN THE BACKYARD GARDEN
gNEb3wpOYhI_4 FOR A PC COMPANY CURTAIN IF YOU GET OFF TYPES SAVE A BEAD OR A CORN THAT ARE BEING DISASTER BECAUSE THEY'RE RELYING ON A THE ADVERTISING ENDING IN NIA CLAIM OF PUER SEE
gNEb3wpOYhI_5 A LETTER IN A BACKYARD GARDEN IF YOU GET A FEW YELLOW BEATS WITH YOUR PINK ONES ARE A FEW OF THEM THE CARROTS WITH YOUR ORANGE ONES THAT MAY NOT BE LIABILITY IT MAY IN FACT BE A BLESSING

gNEb3wpOYhI_9 AND IT THE IT WERE SPECIAL ENOUGH FOR THEM TO SAVE AND TO PRESERVE
gNEb3wpOYhI_10 SO AGAIN WALL IT'S IMPORTANT TO OBSERVE THE THE PRINCIPLES OF PURITY AN SELF POLLINATION VERSUS CROSS POLLINATION JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO ISOLATE OR HAND POLLINATE YOUR CROSS-POLLINATE IN CROPS DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN TRY GROWING THERE SHE
gNEb3wpOYhI_11 AND YOU CAN ALWAYS DO IT FAST AND OF IF YOUR CHEST SHOWS THAT YOU'VE GOT WHAT UNWANTED WARMER SOMETHING THAT'S DESIRABLE NONETHELESS WELL THAT'S INTERESTING IN IT MIGHT EVEN YIELDS UNREMARKABLE RESULTS

G839uQf0kfc_2 TECHNIQUE OF MOVING ON ROCK CAN BE GENERALIZE INTO A FEW PIECES ONE THING IS TO REMEMBER THAT YOU NOT CLIMBING LADDER
G839uQf0kfc_3 IT MAY BE HOLD THE DIMPLE STRAIGHT DOWN ON THAT THEY MAY NOT BE AND IF YOU NOT OPEN TO THE IDEA OF USING HOLDS THAT DON'T LOOK LIKE LADDER RUNGS YOU MISS OUT ON A LOT
G839uQf0kfc_4 SO DON'T ALWAYS IMAGINE YOU GOING TO STEP UP AND PULL DOWN JUST LIKE CLIMBING LADDER
G839uQf0kfc_5 ANOTHER IDEA IS THAT LEGS ARE STRONGER THAN ARMS YOU DON'T NEED TO DO PULL UPS ALL THE WAY UP THE CLIFF TO GET TO THE TOP
G839uQf0kfc_6 IN FACT MOST PEOPLE CAN'T EVEN GOOD CLIMBERS YOU WANT TO USE YOUR LEGS AND A LOT OF CLIMBING TECHNIQUE IS ABOUT FIGURING OUT HOW TO PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR FEET IS VERY ARMS
G839uQf0kfc_7 THIRD THING YOU BONES ARE STRONGER THAN YOUR MUSCLES SO IF I CAN FIND A WAY TO PUSH DOWN AND USE MY BONE ON MY ARM <UNK> ON MY LEG THEN THAT'S IN THE SAME I'M ALSO A LOT OF WORK
G839uQf0kfc_8 A ONE ALWAYS USE MY BONES WHAT I CAN
G839uQf0kfc_9 WHAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT BUT THOSE PIECES WILL HELP YOU REMEMBER THAT HOLD LINE AWAY LIKE LADDER RUNGS IF LEGS A STRONGER THAN ARMS AND BONES ARE STRONG THE MUSCLES

GWKH-f_RT-Y_6 UM ANOTHER THING IS THE FLOOR AND YOU GO AND IT AND START PRACTICING STAGE TIME AND WHAT YOU SHOULD ALWAYS DO IS HAVE A AT HAVE AN OUTLINE OR HAVE A END OF OR REALLY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING IN THE SCENE OR IN THE IN THE STAGE FIGHT INJURED ENEMY DOING
GWKH-f_RT-Y_7 YOU NEVER WANT IMPROV YOU NEVER WANT TO MAKE IT UP ON THE SPOT BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN SOMEONE REALLY GETS FOR
GWKH-f_RT-Y_8 AND THE PUNCH AND REMOVE ANY STAT BEFORE YOU START PRACTICING SHOULD BE WELL WHY THAT
GWKH-f_RT-Y_9 ALSO BEFORE YOU START ON PRACTICING STAGE COMBAT YOU REALLY NEED TO FIND A SPACE THAT'S THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF ROOM
GWKH-f_RT-Y_10 UM LIGHT IN THIS ROOM LEAVE CLEARED OUT MOST EVERYTHING SO THAT IF YOU KNOW I FALL OR ICE LITTLE TRICK <UNK> OFF OF ON UP AND HIT MY HEAD ON A QUARTER OF A COUCH WORKING ON OUR CAN AND NOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF BOOKS OFF A SHELF OR ANYTHING EVERYTHING'S PRETTY PRETTY A CLEAR AND
GWKH-f_RT-Y_11 ALSO YOU WANT A A FLOOR THIS NIGHT IT'S OKAY IF THE FLOOR SEMI HARD
GWKH-f_RT-Y_12 DIFFERENT FALLING ONE IT YOU IS ONE OF THE SOMEWHERE WHERE THERE'S A MAT OR EVEN OUTSIDE ON YOU LINE OR ON THE BEACH

GMc3DMZsVs4_3 SO JULY DO IS TAKE ABOUT A QUARTER INCH SECTION SECTION THAT AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE SECTION YOU CAN LET THAT DROP CLIP THE SECTION BACK AGAIN
GMc3DMZsVs4_4 TAKE A QUARTER INCH SECTION THAT YOU JUST FOLD OUR HOLE OUT AND DROP THAT IT WITH YOUR LARGER SECTION CLIP THAT BACK
GMc3DMZsVs4_5 IT OR QUARTER AND SECTION AND JUST GIVE A LITTLE COMB THROUGH TO THE ENDS TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO TANGLES

hiY_wZXp7tI_1 WE ALL LOVE ARE BEAUTIFUL GREEN MONDS
hiY_wZXp7tI_2 AND THEN ALL THE SUDDENLY FIND THESE WEEDS POPPING UP EVERYWHERE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
hiY_wZXp7tI_3 WE'VE RUN DOWN THE STORE AND GET ALL TYPES OF CHEMICALS THAT WILL KILL THE BROAD LEAVES
hiY_wZXp7tI_4 BUT WHAT WE DON'T REALIZE IS ALL THOSE CHEMICALS OR KILLING EVERYTHING ELSE TO
hiY_wZXp7tI_5 AND THEY'RE REALLY BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
hiY_wZXp7tI_6 THE GIVEN TO WATERWAYS AND THEY'RE DOING MATZAH DAMAGE TO THE FISH
hiY_wZXp7tI_7 SO WHAT ARE SOME ALTERNATIVES TO GETTING RID OF THE WEEDS IN OUR GARDEN
hiY_wZXp7tI_8 FIRST OF ALL THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR LAWN IS TO GIVE IT'S MORE GRASS SEED IN THE SPRING IN THE FALL
hiY_wZXp7tI_9 SO THE EASIEST WAY TO GET RID OF WEEDS IN YOUR LAWN ARE TO STOP THEM FROM SHOWING UP AT ALL IS TO JUST TAKE THE LITTLE AREAS IN A GUARD WHERE THERE ARE SOME LEANS OR BLANK SPOTS AND EVERY SPRING IN THE LATE SPRING ABOUT APRIL WHEN THE NIGHTS OF GETTING A LITTLE WARMER JUST ADD A BUNCH OF COMPOST OR POTTING SOIL ON TOP OF YOUR WEEDS AND IS GRASS SEED
hiY_wZXp7tI_10 IS THAT LOTS OF GRASS SEED PERENNIAL GRASSY THAT'LL COME BACK EVERY YEAR ON TOP OF THE DIRT
hiY_wZXp7tI_11 AND YOU'LL FIND THE GRAVEL DOES FILL IN ABOVE THE WEEDS IN THE WEEDS WON'T BE THERE
hiY_wZXp7tI_12 I'VE DONE IS EVERY SPRING EVERY FALL AND I FOUND THAT MOST OF THE WEEDS IN MY LAWN ARE GONE WITH LITTLE TO NO TROUBLE AT ALL
gEkoOhu1PEM_1 WE'RE IN A BEGINNER DEMONSTRATION AN ACTUAL RANCH SORTING
gEkoOhu1PEM_2 IT'LL BE A LITTLE BIT SLOWER SO WE CAN TRY TO HIGHLIGHT EMPHASIZE THE SKILL AND STRATEGY INVOLVED
gEkoOhu1PEM_3 OUR COWS OR NOT NUMBERED CORRECTLY TODAY
gEkoOhu1PEM_4 SO WE'RE GONNA BE DOING SOME DUPLICATE AND IMPROVISING SO THAT WE CAN SHOW THE SPORT OF WE WON'T BE NECESSARY ABLE TO DO THE FULL SEQUENCE OF NUMBERS
gEkoOhu1PEM_5 WE DO HAVE TWELVE COUTS WILL CONTINUE TO SORT THEM ONE AT A TIME IN THE ORDER THAT WE'VE COME TO UNDERSTAND
gEkoOhu1PEM_6 IT'LL START WITH THE ANNOUNCER SAYING FLAGS UP AN AJAJ SITTING RIGHT HERE AT THE FOUL LINE
gEkoOhu1PEM_7 THE JUDGE WILL HAVE A FLAG UP AND AS THEY SAY THAT IT IN TILES MEAT ACROSS THE LINE
gEkoOhu1PEM_8 AT WHICH TIME THE ANNOUNCER WILL SAY YOUR NUMBER IS
gEkoOhu1PEM_9 WE'RE GONNA START WITH ZERO TODAY SO THAT WE SLOWLY GO THROUGH AND SHOW YOU MORE THAN STRATEGY AND THAT WILL PICK IT UP TO BE JUST BE
gEkoOhu1PEM_10 SO I'M GONNA GO IN THERE AND I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR MY ZERO AND THEN SLOWLY BRING IT ACROSS AS LAURA GUARDS WHAT WE CALL THE HOLE
gEkoOhu1PEM_11 I WANTED TRIED OF RANGE AS FEW COWS ISN'T AS I CAN SO THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORK QUITE SO HARD AT PROTECTING THAT IMPORTANT SPACE
gEkoOhu1PEM_12 IF THE WRONG COW COMES ACROSS THAN WE'VE COMPLETELY GONE BUST
gEkoOhu1PEM_13 WE HAVE TWO ONES TODAY SO I'M LOOKING FOR MY NEXT MONTH AND IT COMES ON VERY EASILY FOR NOW LOOK FOR OUR THREES
gEkoOhu1PEM_14 WE DO NOT HAVE A TWO
gEkoOhu1PEM_15 WE HAVE TWO THREES TODAY
gEkoOhu1PEM_16 THAT WOULD BE THE NEXT ORDER AND SHE AS SHE BRINGS IT AROUND AND TRYING TO LET MY HORSE DO ITS JOB AND IF BOTH OF AN GAME TO GATHER SINCE THAT'S OUR PREFERRED ORDER TODAY
gEkoOhu1PEM_17 THAT WOULD RECOMMEND THAT OF TRASH COUGH WE GOT A STOP BATH
gEkoOhu1PEM_18 OKAY SO NOW I'M IN A GO GET THE THREE EIGHTH AND LAUREL LET IT GO AND NOW SHE'S THAN A LEAD FAR WE HAVE A FOUR WITH AN AT FOUR COMES ACROSS I'M ALREADY ON MY WAY OUT AND NOW I HAVE TWO SEVENTH AND THINK THEY'RE COMING TO GATHER WILL LET THEM GO
gEkoOhu1PEM_19 IN OUR OF COMPETITION IF WE HAD TO IN ORDER THAT WOULD BE FINE AS LONG AS THEY WERE CORRECTLY PLACE
gEkoOhu1PEM_20 THE ELBOW I GET THE RED COW TO THE WHITE FACE AND LEAVE THE BLACK AND WHITE

gwXiVX3GwN4_5 IN THIS CASE THE MOSQUITO CARD EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONLY A ONE ONE CAN DEFEAT THE CREST AND CRACK WARMTH BECAUSE IT'S TOUGHNESS IS ONLY ONE
gwXiVX3GwN4_6 IF THERE'S OF CREATURE WITH FIRST RAKE INVOLVED IN COMBAT THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL COMBAT DAMAGE STEP JUST FOR FUR STRIKERS AND ONLY CREATURES THAT SURVIVE THE FIRST RIGHT COMBAT DAMAGE THAT ARE ALLOWED TO DEAL THEIR DAMAGE IN RETURN
gwXiVX3GwN4_7 THE MOSQUITO GUARD WILL KILL THE CREST AND CRACK OR AND BY DOING ONE POINT OF FIRST WRITE AN INCH
gwXiVX3GwN4_8 AND MOSQUITO GUARD SURVIVES WITH OF WITHOUT TAKING THE FOUR DAMAGE THAT THE CRESTED CRACK OR WOOD DEALS

GWvJ14cwwKU_14 ELBOWS TO KNEES PUSH UP AND THEN JUST TOUCH AND GO
GWvJ14cwwKU_15 WE DON'T WANT ANY WEIGHT ON THIS BECAUSE WE WANT THIS TO BE A VAST WHICH MUSCLE GROUP WORK AS OPPOSED TO SLIP SWITCH
GWvJ14cwwKU_16 JUST DRIVE IT UP AND DOWN
GWvJ14cwwKU_17 GET THE HEART RATE UP
GWvJ14cwwKU_18 THE LEGS FIRING
GWvJ14cwwKU_19 RELAX THE SHOULDERS DOWN THE SPINE CHEST OPEN
GWvJ14cwwKU_20 AGAIN ONE A DUAL REPS TO VALUE ON THIS ONE HAS EIGHT TO TWELVE REPS AND ENOUGH PROBABLY FOR YOU TO TRY TO BUILD UP ONE REP AT A TIME AND TWO TO THREE SETS MCCOLLEY DOOR TOUCHING THE SLOTS
gZXd5wK4rW4_1 OKAY SO WE'VE LANNON HARD PAN HERE
gZXd5wK4rW4_2 HEART AND GETS ITS NAME BECAUSE THIS IS VERY HARD SOIL
gZXd5wK4rW4_3 THERE'S NO GRASS ON THERE'S NO MOISTURE IS PRETTY GOOD HARD BAKE BY THE SONG
gZXd5wK4rW4_4 SO THE PROBLEM WITH HITTING OFF OF THIS IF YOU CAN'T GET THE CLUB UNDERNEATH THE BALL IT YOU CAN IN GRASS OR SAND OR EVEN LOOSE IMPEDIMENTS
gZXd5wK4rW4_5 SO THIS IS A TOUGH LIGHT BECAUSE YET TO GET YOU DO HAVE TO TRY TO GET UNDERNEATH THE BALL A LITTLE BIT TO GET IT OFF
gZXd5wK4rW4_6 SAUT RITUAL OR HOW TO DO HERE IS TO PICK THE BALL CLEANLY OFF THIS OF SERVICE HAS IT IS ALMOST LIKE GETTING OFF OF CONCRETE
gZXd5wK4rW4_7 SO WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH THE HARD PAN LITTLE MATTER WHERE YOU PLAY AT IS THE FINEST COURSES MIGHT HAVE SPOTS OF THIS BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S HEARTIER GRASS TO GROW DO TREES OR WHAT HAVE YOU HIT THE TARGET
gZXd5wK4rW4_8 SO YOU LINE UP A I CUTE A NORMAL SHOT BUT I WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE AND SUPER RELAX BECAUSE UKE IF YOU TRY TO MUSCLE THIS BALL WHAT HAPPENS IS OFF HARD PAN THE CLUB HITS THE HARD PAN AND THEN SKIPS IN THE BACK OF A BALL PRODUCING A SKULL SHOT
gZXd5wK4rW4_9 AND THAT'S REACH IT WAS A LOT OF STROKES IS WHEN YOU THE SKULL YOU IS CALLED ALL THE CAN GO IN THE WATER SAND TREES WHO KNOWS WHERE
gZXd5wK4rW4_10 SO WHEN RHINEHART CAN DON'T GET TO A DISCOURAGED

gZXd5wK4rW4_13 AND IT HARD PAN ISN'T SO HARD
gJpKOK4X3MI_1 EYES AS WE'RE A OUTDOORS WHAT I GET AS A MY ROLLER HOCKEY BALL
gJpKOK4X3MI_2 I'LL HAVE OR AND I'VE HAD THE ROLLER HOCKEY BLOCK OUT
gJpKOK4X3MI_3 BUT BASICALLY OF THE BALL MOVES REALLY WELL OUT HERE
gJpKOK4X3MI_4 ON THE A DISEASES CRACKS OUT ON THE SURFACE ON IT BUT IT JUST HELPS WITH AUTOCRAT STUFF LIKE THAT AND IT'S EASY TO CONTROL TIE AS YOU CAN SEE
gJpKOK4X3MI_5 A MINNOW HAVEN'T CROWN MOVE BACK AND FORTH
gJpKOK4X3MI_6 OUT THE SAI I MEAN YOU DO NOW HERE'S A GREAT IDEA
gJpKOK4X3MI_7 MOST THE OUTDOOR ROUTE ROLLER HOCKEY PLAYERS WOULD USE A BALL JUST LIKE THIS
gJpKOK4X3MI_8 AND IT'S NICE HARD PLASTIC
gJpKOK4X3MI_9 OUT OF YOUR SHOE THAT A GOALIE DEADLY ONE WHERE PROPER EQUIPMENT OF OR A YOU KNOW EVEN SHIN GUARDS FOR THE PLAYERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
gJpKOK4X3MI_10 REGULAR QUICKER WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA USING THIS
gJpKOK4X3MI_11 OTHERWISE USE A NOZZLE USE A TENNIS BALL OR SOME LIKE THAT
gJpKOK4X3MI_12 WHAT IS THE REGULAR OF POCKET YOU TWENTIES OUTDOORS
H_h0ReudZLw_1 OKAY NEXT I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE A SERIES OF EXERCISES
H_h0ReudZLw_2 THE FIRST IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT EXERCISES AND PULLS IS IN THE YOGA AND POLITE IT'S FAMILIES ARE EXCELLENT FOR KNEE PROBLEMS
H_h0ReudZLw_3 THESE EXERCISES ONE PERFORMED ON A CONSISTENT BASES DEFINITELY GETS YOUR BODY FILL IN STRONGER AND IT DEFINITELY DOESN'T OF STRESS ON THE KNEE
H_h0ReudZLw_4 SO IF YOU DO HAVE A LOCAL COMMUNITY CENTER OR EVENT OF A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR YOGA STUDIO NEAR YOU WHEN YOU HAVE KNEE PROBLEMS YOU MAY WANT TO GET A MEMBERSHIP THERE
H_h0ReudZLw_5 OR YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE SOME CLASSES THERE OR YOU COULD JUST POP THEN YOGA IMPOLITE THESE VIDEOS AT HOME IF THAT'S WHAT YOU PREFER
H_h0ReudZLw_6 BUT THOSE EXERCISES ARE EXCELLENT FOR KNEE PROBLEMS AND I DEFINITELY ADVISE YOU TO FOLLOW PROGRAM WHEN A CONSISTENT BASIS TO REALLY SUPPORT EVEN THOUGH A GETTING THE THE KNEE FILLING STRONGER AND SUPPORTED
H_h0ReudZLw_7 SO WE SUPPORT THE MUSCLES THAT AROUND THE KNEE THAN WE DEFINITELY TAKE A LOT OF STRESS OFF OF THE KNEE
H_h0ReudZLw_8 SO THESE EXERCISES THAT I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE WILL DEFINITELY STRENGTH IN YOUR WHOLE BODY
H_h0ReudZLw_9 PERFORM THEM ON A CONSISTENT BASIS AND YOU WILL SEE RESULTS
GSWTIFLqaJQ_1 YOU CAN ALSO GET A CAN OF THE DIFFERENT FEEL BY ADDING ON NOTES IN THE LOWER REGISTER
GSWTIFLqaJQ_2 THIS IS A ON THE IN ON THE LOW STRING TO THE GUITAR
GSWTIFLqaJQ_3 ON IN THIS THING YOU CAN AND IT'S SOMETIMES ALTHOUGH A WALKING BASS SOUND OR I'M CUT LITTLE ON AS WITH A LITTLE BLUESY BASE NOTE AND ADDED TO WHAT I'M DOING
GSWTIFLqaJQ_4 SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN PLAYING IT HE HIM TO HOW ON THE OF THE AND OF ONE HUNDRED LOSES SILENT E BOON THAT ONE OUT AND I'VE AT IS THIS ONE HIM AN HIM AN IN TAMPON THEM IN TIME IN
GSWTIFLqaJQ_5 SO I'M ACTUALLY ON YOU KNOW A COUPLE THINGS HERE I'M ON ADDING THIS NOTE HERE IN ON THE THIRD FRET ON THE LOW E STRING
GSWTIFLqaJQ_6 BUT IN IT A GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF A BENT YOU'VE HEARD THAT IT
GSWTIFLqaJQ_7 I'M KIND OF A GOING
GSWTIFLqaJQ_8 I'M LANDING IN THEM AND CAN GETTING A LITTLE DONE A LITTLE PULL
GSWTIFLqaJQ_9 SO I'M GONNA ADD NOT JUST A NICE AMOUNT OF LOSING FLY TO A BAT ON BUT NOW YOU'RE ADDING NOTES OF IN THE LOWER END WHICH GIVES IT HAS WALKING BASS AND BEND THEM AND THEN BEND THEM IN THEM THEN
GWDDHTiRehI_1 IN THE NEXT ABOUT ONE OF THE STRESS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING PLENTY OF JUMP ROPES IN A GYM ON AND NOT ALL ONE SIZE NOT ALL JUST ONE A LENGTH NOT ALL ONE DESIGN ONE HAVE AN ASSORTMENT OF JUMP ROPE SO THAT YOU GET A GOOD VARIETY ON FOR THE VARIETY OF BOXER THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
GWDDHTiRehI_2 YOU DON'T WANT TO JUMP UP THAT ARE SHORTER ON WHAT THE JUMP ROPE CENTER THAT ARE LIGHT IN WEIGHT AND WAS JUMP ROPES BETTER THAT ARE QUITE A LONG AND ALSO JUMP ROPES THAT ARE THAT ARE THICKER AND HEAVIER
GWDDHTiRehI_3 ON ONE OF THE JUMP ROPE CERTAINLY LOOKING AT IS THE PLASTIC SPEED ROLLED
GWDDHTiRehI_4 THIS IS A LITTLE BIT FASTER THAN YOUR AVERAGE JUMP ROLL ON ITS ALSO ADJUSTABLE AS A IN ONE SHOE OF DECIDING NEEDLE THE SHORTER YOU CAN PASS IT THROUGH OF PUT ON ANOTHER KNOT AND THEN I'M ACTUALLY SHORTEN IT
GWDDHTiRehI_5 CAUSE ONCE A SHORT IT'S IS SHORT
GWDDHTiRehI_6 GET A JUMP ROPES WITHIN THE LOOKING AT IS A A LEATHER MORE HEAVIER JUMP ROPE
GWDDHTiRehI_7 ON THIS ALSO HAS WEIGHTED HANDLES FOR NOT ONLY IS THE LEATHER WILL THAT HEAVIER BUT ALSO THE WEIGHTED HANDLES REVIEW EVEN MORE OF A BETTER WORKOUT
GWDDHTiRehI_8 ON ANOTHER THIRD JUMP FILTERED LOOKING AT IS SIMPLE COTTON JUMP ROLL ON A LITTLE THIS LOWER ON A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO USE THEM THE QUICKER FASTER ONES AND THE HEAVIER ONES
GpYSBDInzAc_1 OTHER ACTIVITY THAT KIDS HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH THIS BEATING BIRDS IN THE WINNER
GpYSBDInzAc_2 IT'S IT CREDIT EXCITING BECAUSE YOU GET TO SEE A LOT OF REALLY COLORFUL BIRDS THEY STAND OUT IN THE SNOW AND YOU CAN DO GAME WITH THE KIDS WHERE THE KNOW WHO CAN SEE THE FIRST CARD OR THE FIRST BLUEJAY THAT COMES AT YOU PUT THE FOOD ENOUGH IN THE OFF BIRDFEEDER'S
GpYSBDInzAc_3 SO IT HELPS THEM TO LEARN ABOUT NATURE ON A COMMAND BEANS OUT OF IT AND A GIFT OUTSIDE
GpYSBDInzAc_4 AND ALL MY NO FROM FOR MY KIDS THEY DEFINITELY APPRECIATE WATCHING THE BIRDS ENJOY THE FOOT THAT WE KICK OUT THERE
GpYSBDInzAc_5 SO ON DOES THE ANOTHER ACTIVITY GETS OUTSIDE
GpYSBDInzAc_6 A VEIL RIGHT OVER THERE
GpYSBDInzAc_7 IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOME FADERS ARABLE ENOUGH OF THE KIDS CAN ACTUALLY PUT THE BIRD FEET IN THEMSELVES
GpYSBDInzAc_8 I'VE GOT A FEW THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER OUT
GpYSBDInzAc_9 UM BUT I THINK THE ACTIVE THEM BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY POUR IT IN THEMSELVES ON HAS WILL BE THE MEANING FOR THEM AND ON AGAIN HAPPEN THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN FOR LIKE A PART OF THE ACTIVITY
GpYSBDInzAc_10 IF IT THAT IF IT IF WE'RE THIEF THE HOLE THAT FORM
GpYSBDInzAc_11 SHE'S <UNK>

HB7sHwAxCBg_4 IN THINKING ABOUT BACKYARD BIRDING THERE ARE A VARIETY OF THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WILL MAXIMIZE THE EXPERIENCE
HB7sHwAxCBg_5 ONE OF THESE IS OBVIOUSLY TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF BIRDS WHICH MEANS THAT BY LOCATING YOUR FEEDERS IN PLACES WHERE THEY ARE RELATIVELY CLOSE TO SHRUBS THAT BIRDS CAN QUICKLY ESCAPE INTO OR TREES THAT THEY CAN FLY UP INTO OUT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT OF THING TO KEEP IN MIND BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE SAFETY OF THE BACK YOUR BIRD IS IMPORTANT
HB7sHwAxCBg_6 LIKEWISE IF YOU HAVE A CAT YOU SHOULD KEEP THE CAT INDOORS
HB7sHwAxCBg_7 ON FOR CHILI LOTS OF FOLKS HAVE THE FEELING THAT IF THEY PUT A CAT OUT THE FRONT OR IN A BIRDFEEDER'S IN THE BACKYARD THERE WON'T BE A CONFLICT WELL UNFORTUNATE THAT'S NOT THE CASE
HB7sHwAxCBg_8 LIKEWISE OF NOT HAVING NOT YOUR FEEDERS SITUATED IN PLACES WHERE YOU CAN SEE THEM IS IMPORTANT THE WATER PUT THEM IN A PLACE WHERE YOU HAVE READY OF YOU ABILITY FROM A WINDOW OR WHATEVER OF <UNK>
HB7sHwAxCBg_9 LIKEWISE IN ORDER TO HAVE THE FEEDERS BE RELATIVELY FREE FROM OUT WHAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD DESCRIBED AS PASTY COMPETITORS LIKE SWIRLS IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE BAFFLES OF THIS START OUR ON THE POLE AND AS YOU CAN SEE IN AS WE MENTIONED SHORTLY THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF BIRDFEEDER'S AND SO ON THAT CAN BE OFF PUT UP FOR FOR BIRDS
HB7sHwAxCBg_10 BIRDS WILL FIND THEM AND IN ADDITION TO HANGING FEEDERS LIKE THIS THAT ARE FILLED WITH SEE WITH THE APPROPRIATE BAFFLED KEEP OF I'M PESKY SWIRLS AND THINGS AWAY
HB7sHwAxCBg_11 IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO PUT BIRD SEED RIGHT ON THE GROUND LOTS OF BIRDS WILL WILL HAPPILY FEED ON THE GROUND AND ACTUALLY DON'T LIKE TO NECESSARILY OF I'M FEED OFF THE GROUND
HB7sHwAxCBg_12 SO AGAIN YOU'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE A MIX OF OF SORT OF OVERALL LANDSCAPE LEVEL CONSIDERATIONS THAT WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE LOCATION OF YOUR VIEWING STATION OR WINDOWS AS WELL AS PROVIDE OUT CONDITIONS THAT ARE HOPEFULLY GOING TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE BIRDS THAT ARE TRYING TO ATTRACT YOUR YARD
GcGzewrbLF4_1 IN THIS SECTION I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT GAME NUMBER SIX
GcGzewrbLF4_2 AND OF LITTLE QUICK REMINDER SOME THESE GAMES MAY SEEM TEDIOUS SOURCE SEEM LIKE IT'S INSTRUCTIONAL REALLY IT'S A LOT OF FUN IF YOU DO IT

g9bQ72e7ZMo_1 WE'RE GOING TO VENTURE INTO WHAT I WOULD CALL MY PERFORMANCE BITS
g9bQ72e7ZMo_2 I WOULD KEEP A BIT SIMILAR TO THIS HANGING UP IN MY TACK ROOM READY FOR WHAT I CALL THE DRESS REHEARSAL
g9bQ72e7ZMo_3 IF I HAVE A PERFORMANCE HORSE AND WE'RE GETTING READY TO COMPETE A HIGH LEVEL IT'S QUITE LIKELY THAT AND THEN START TO SWITCH THAT HORSE INTO WHAT'S CONSIDERED YOUR TRADITIONAL KIND OF QUART STYLE LEVERAGE BIT
g9bQ72e7ZMo_4 THE COURT IS THIS RAISED AREA
g9bQ72e7ZMo_5 THIS ONE'S RATHER HIGH SOMEWHAT ASSERTIVE
g9bQ72e7ZMo_6 YOU MIGHT CONSIDER THIS A VERY STRONG BET
g9bQ72e7ZMo_7 WE HAVE SAYINGS THAT EVEN THE RIGHT DID IN THE WRONG HE HANDS CAN BE A PROBLEM TO THE HORSE
g9bQ72e7ZMo_8 THIS COULD BE CONSIDERED WRAP CLEAR WRONG THAT IF IT WERE IN THE WRONG HANDS
g9bQ72e7ZMo_9 BUT IN THE CORRECT HANDS A RIDER HAS VERY ACCOMPLISHED TRAINED IN THE PRISON PRESENTATION OF A GOOD PERFORMANCE HORSE THIS IS THE KIND OF BIT THAT WILL BRING YOU TO THE DRESS REHEARSAL THAT WILL ULTIMATELY TAKE YOU TO THE STATE
g9bQ72e7ZMo_10 I USE THIS ONE AND TRAINING A HORSE TRYING TO CONVERT FROM THE SAND THIS NOW FOOLS IN THE SHANK SAMPLES TO MOVE ON TO WHAT WE WOULD ALSO USE THEN WHEN WE GET TO THAT MORE HIGHLY POLISHED FANCY SILVER SORT OF BIT THAT WE WOULD USE THAT HAS THE SAME MECHANISM AS MY TREATING BIT
g9bQ72e7ZMo_11 BUT I RESERVED THIS POLISH IT UP TO THE SIDE FOR WHEN WE GO TO THE SHOWS
g9bQ72e7ZMo_12 A BIT LIKE THIS MIGHT BE SEEN IN ALL THIS IS ALL KINDS OF DISCIPLINES CRITICALLY ON HORSES THAT ARE OVER FIVE YEARS OLD
g9bQ72e7ZMo_13 UNDER FIVE YEARS OLD WE CONSIDER THEM JUNIOR HORSES AND THEY CAN PERFORM AT ALL LEVELS TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE IN THEIR SNAPPLE THAT'S TYPICALLY YOU LOOSE RING D RINGS
g9bQ72e7ZMo_14 BUT ONCE THEY GET TO BE OF THE SENIOR OR AGED COURSES THEY MUST SHOW AND PERFORM IN A CURB ARE OR HOW LEVERAGE BIT
g9bQ72e7ZMo_15 SO WE TYPICALLY GO TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT CREATES A FAERIE ASSERTIVE EASY TO PERFORM HOLDING THEM IN THAT COLLECTED WHAT WE CALL HOOKED IN THE BRIDLE APPEARANCE
g9bQ72e7ZMo_16 I WOULDN'T WANT TO USE THIS IN TRAINING
g9bQ72e7ZMo_17 IT WOULD TAKE AWAY THE SENSITIVITY OVER TIME
g9bQ72e7ZMo_18 BUT IN USED IN A PERFORMANCE FORCE THIS IS GONNA PUT ENOUGH PRESSURE TO THE ROOF OF THEIR MOUTH THAT WITH VERY LITTLE HAND MOVEMENT THIS BIT IS GONNA PUT THEM RIGHT WHERE I NEED AN IN WITHOUT ANY HAND MOVEMENT ON MY CAR
GAEUXO3Pe1w_1 LEARNING HOW TO SING I'LL <UNK> IF YOU DON'T HAVE A NATURAL ABILITY AND ONE I LEARNED HOW TO SING CAN THEM
GAEUXO3Pe1w_2 YOU CAN GET VOCAL LESSONS IT NORMALLY ON YOUR OWN
GAEUXO3Pe1w_3 I WAS TREAD EMULATE A SINGERS IT YOU REALLY LIKE HOW AND TRY TO SING LIKE PAN
GAEUXO3Pe1w_4 IN CHINA DEFINITELY CAN STAND KEY X AND MOST IMPORTANT THING
GAEUXO3Pe1w_5 THE STEM HE THAN NOT OUT JUST EXERCISE BY A SING ALONG TO YOUR FAVORITE OVAL LISTS AND THEN IN EXPAND OFF OF THAT
GAEUXO3Pe1w_6 OUR UNDERTONE WORK ON LIVE IN AN OUNCE
GAEUXO3Pe1w_7 I'M LEARNING HOW TO SING IS ON A LOT OF IT IS NATURAL ABILITY
GAEUXO3Pe1w_8 AN STAYING ON KIEWIT KNOWING IF YOU'RE HIGHER THAN THE NOTE OR LOWER THAN THE NOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT
GAEUXO3Pe1w_9 IF YOU CAN IF YOU CAN SING ALONG AND YOU HEAR YOURSELF AND IF YOU KNOW THAT YOUR LOWER THAN THE NO IN CAN SING UP TO THE RIGHT NOW
GAEUXO3Pe1w_10 I THEN THAT'S GOOD
GAEUXO3Pe1w_11 NOTHING TO DO IS THE OUT AND YOU CAN RECORD IS OFTEN YOU KNEW THAT I HAVE TO HAVE A RECORDING STUDIO AND GET OUT A LITTLE VOICE RECORDER NEEDED SING ALONG THE LISTEN YOURSELF
GAEUXO3Pe1w_12 SO WE GET A BETTER OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE OF FLUFF OF MIXING THEM
GAEUXO3Pe1w_13 SO BASICALLY YOU MISS A NEW FAVORITE SINGERS YOU LOVE RECORDER SOFT LISTEN YOURSELF ON FROM DIFFER PERSPECTIVE
GAEUXO3Pe1w_14 DOWN THOSE OF THREE MOST BASIC THINGS AGAIN OF ITSELF AND HOUSING
g5i7jfPAPXQ_1 ONCE YOU HAVE A CONFIDENT FOUR BALL SHOWER PATTERN DOWN YOU CAN LEARN TRICKS WITHIN IT IN VARIOUS VARIATIONS
g5i7jfPAPXQ_2 THIS IS ONE OF THEM
g5i7jfPAPXQ_3 I CALL IT A SHOWER STACK OR YOU CAN ALSO CALL IT A MULTI PLEX UP WITH CENTER
g5i7jfPAPXQ_4 NOW THE THINGS TO PRACTICE FOR THIS OUR FIRST OF ALL DAY WITH THE THROW YOUR STACK MULTIPLEX HIGH AND TO THE OTHER HAND
g5i7jfPAPXQ_5 ONCE YOU CAN DO THAT START THE VENT THE BALLS ONE IN THE TIME BACK TO THE HAND WE'RE THROWN FROM
g5i7jfPAPXQ_6 YOU WANT TO PRACTICE THIS ON BOTH SIDES OF COURSE AS THE TRICK LOOK BETTER IF YOU CAN DO IT BOTH DIRECTIONS
g5i7jfPAPXQ_7 ANYTHING AT ALL FOUR BALLS START SHOWER PATTERN STACK A MULTI PLEX ANGULAR TOSS
g5i7jfPAPXQ_8 AFTER YOU'VE CHAUCER MULTIPLEX JUST PRACTICE STOPPING INTO YOU CAN GET THE MULTIPLEX LIT WELL ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN BEND THEM OVER WHEN A TIME AND CONTINUE THE SHOWER PAN
GvggbtnnSaI_1 HE WOULDN'T DO NOW HOW ON IF WE'VE WEDGED UP CLAY AND GO IT'S ON THE OKAY SO WE'VE WEDGED OFF LAWS LUMP OF CLAY TO MAKE THIS BIG BOLD WITHIN A MAY COME UP AND THE THINGS YOU DON'T WANT EQUIPMENT WISE HUMAN ONE AND BACK
GvggbtnnSaI_2 NOW I LIKE TO USE A BACK IT'S BENEFIT ON MY WHEEL OR AND GIVE A NICE AN EDGE AROUND IT
GvggbtnnSaI_3 NOW THIS MEANS I CAN TENNIS THAT CLAY AROUND THERE TO HOLD THIS HOP DOWN WHILE I'M CENTERING AND WORKING ON THIS LARGE PEAS
GvggbtnnSaI_4 THE BACK AND HAVE A TEN SEED WHAT PULL UP ON YOU AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT WHEN YOU'RE WORKING ON SOMETHING BIG LIKE THIS
GvggbtnnSaI_5 THE TOOLS UP THAT I USE FOR THROWING LODGED BOWLS THESE IN MY MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS IN THESE THE RIBS WOODEN RIBS AND I USE THOSE TO SHAPE THE BALL AND TO SQUEEZE THE CLAY WILL SHIMON THAT LAND
GvggbtnnSaI_6 THESE ARE TRIMMING TOOLS WILL USE THESE ONCE THE BALL HAS DRIED OUT AND WILL FLIP IT OVER AND USE THESE TO TRIM THE BASE OF IT
GvggbtnnSaI_7 THIS IS A PIN TOOL
GvggbtnnSaI_8 PASS WILL SEAM ON THIS LATER BUT IT'S JUST A GENERAL TOOL THAT USED FOR AROUND FOR A IE THE COPPING THAT SULFUR BOWLS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
GvggbtnnSaI_9 THIS IS A WIRE TOOL AND WOULDN'T USE THAT TO DISCONNECT THE BOWL AT THE END OF THE PROJECT
GvggbtnnSaI_10 WE NEED THINGS LIKE SPAWN HIS
GvggbtnnSaI_11 WE NEED WATER
GvggbtnnSaI_12 I LIKE TO USE A LITTLE WARM WHAT HAS NICE ON THE HANDS AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE GONNA NEED NOW WE'RE READY TO MOVE THE CLAY ONTO THE WHEEL HEAD AND GET IT CENTERED UP
hhimjseyKbA_1 HERE WE HAVE LIGHT HAS BEEN TITLE ALIEN TURN FLEA AND AGAIN LIKE EVERYTHING ALL VERY LITERAL
hhimjseyKbA_2 THE DEFINITION SERIES THE HEIGHT OF FLEA BECAUSE WE HAVE A A SLEEVE AT ALL AND THEN INTO LITTLE POLAR MIRRORING LINE TURN LANE AND PLAY AND ONES AND WHAT WE HAVE HERE AN ACTUAL REALITY THING WOULD BE TO SEPARATE PIECES FOR <UNK>
hhimjseyKbA_3 THERE'S HITTING THE YOUR FITTED SLEEVE WINCH IT HAS THAT TO THE THREE OR VERSION THAT AND HE
hhimjseyKbA_4 IT COULD BE THREE ORDERLY DOWNS YOU KNIT LIME AND SO YOU HAVE HOUSE OFF ON THE FLOOR HUNT
hhimjseyKbA_5 AND THEN THERE'S IS SLEEVE LINE LIVING HUNDREDS AND HE HAS A MATTER OF THAT CREASE AND MAKE THE ACTUAL EVENLY AND TURN PART OF THIS AND ARRIVE IN <UNK> TO ADD IN THE EASE OF MOVEMENT I THERE BECAUSE THAT ALSO HOLES TO CREATE THE GENTLY INTERN SHAPE
hhimjseyKbA_6 AND THEN A THE UPSIDE DOWN VERSION OF WE HAVE A LOW
hhimjseyKbA_7 JUST FLIP IT AND ON THE END OF THE RED LINE IN AN PERMANENTLY
GOaR6NnPmL0_1 IN THIS CLIP I'M GOING TO DISCUSS WHAT AN OCTAVE IS
GOaR6NnPmL0_2 ESSENTIALLY IF YOU START WITH A NOTE WHERE YOUR YOUR WEIGHT IS GOING ON HERE
GOaR6NnPmL0_3 REALLY REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT ONE FULL CYCLE BECAUSE IT'S JUST REPEAT IT ALL THE WAY DOWN STRENGTH
GOaR6NnPmL0_4 AN OCTAVE WOULD MEAN IF YOU TAKE THIS WAY LIKE RIGHT HERE IN NEW DOUBLE THE FREQUENCY
GOaR6NnPmL0_5 WHICH WOULD MEAN INSTEAD OF HAVING THIS GOING ON YOU NOW COMPLETE THE WHOLE CYCLE HALFWAY THROUGH
GOaR6NnPmL0_6 SO HERE I'VE BE DEALING DENON ALL AND UP LIKE THAT
GOaR6NnPmL0_7 SO THIS WAY OF THE WIND IS TRUE WOULD BE AN OCTAVE HIGHER THAN THE ONE BEFORE
GOaR6NnPmL0_8 AN OCTAVE WOULD BE THE SAME NOTE
GOaR6NnPmL0_9 SO FOR EXAMPLE IN A YOU KNOW IF THIS ISN'T A NOTE THIS WOULD ALSO BE IN A BUT AN OCTAVE HIGHER
GOaR6NnPmL0_10 SO FOR EXAMPLE MAMA LAST
GOaR6NnPmL0_11 LOMA THEY'RE BOTH A'S BUT THIS ONE WOULD BE HIGHER BY WHAT'S CALLED AN OCTAVE

Gwb5TRtcGu4_1 NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF MAKING YOUR OWN VERSUS BUYING A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT
Gwb5TRtcGu4_2 NOW I KNOW THAT THE PROSPECT OF MAKING YOUR OWN CLEANSER CONSUME LITTLE DAUNTING BUT REALLY IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH EASIER THAN YOU WOULD THINK AND SOME IS CHEAPER THAN BUYING OVER THE COUNTER
Gwb5TRtcGu4_3 IT CAN ALSO BE VERY REWARDING ONCE YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE PUTTING ON YOUR SKIN
Gwb5TRtcGu4_4 AS I MENTIONED FOR THE MOST PAR MAKING YOUR OWN CAN BE CHEAPER THAN THE COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS
Gwb5TRtcGu4_5 IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THESE INGREDIENTS HERE AND GO INTO YOUR STORY OF REALIZE THEY ALL YOU'RE DOING IS JUST BUYING VERY INEXPENSIVE PRODUCTS
Gwb5TRtcGu4_6 BUYING MILK HONEY AND BOATS ALL OF WHICH YOU CAN PURCHASE INTO ANY STORE ANTS PURCHASE IT JUST THAT IN PRICE
Gwb5TRtcGu4_7 IF YOU GO TO BUY OVER THE COUNTER COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS THAT ARE TO BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE
Gwb5TRtcGu4_8 YOU CAN USUALLY SPEND UP TO FIVE DOLLARS SEVEN DOLLARS A BOTTLE
Gwb5TRtcGu4_9 AND FOR THIS IS THE END OF THESE THAT MUCH FOR SO MUCH MORE
Gwb5TRtcGu4_10 THERE'S ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY IN COST YOU CAN'T FIND IF YOU BUY COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS
Gwb5TRtcGu4_11 IF YOU GO UP TO THE CANNER ALL THERE IS JUST ONE PRICE FOR THAT ONE BOTTLE
Gwb5TRtcGu4_12 WHERE AS IF YOU NEED TO SAVE LITTLE BUTTON MONEY YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND DO SOME SHOPPING AROUND FINDS AND GINGER MILK MAYBE FRIENDS AND YOUR HONEYMOON MEDIUM FIND A LOCAL BEEKEEPER WILL SELL A TWO LITTLE BIT LESS THEN IF YOU WERE TO BITE IN THE STORE
Gwb5TRtcGu4_13 YOU HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY THERE THEN IF YOU NEEDED TO JUST GO INTO THE DRUG STORE PICK UP A BOTTLE OFF THE COUNTER THEY'RE NOT FACILITY MANY CHEAPER THAN WHAT'S ON THE LABEL
g8qogDYpMGI_1 MY NAME IS ANTHONY MALONEY AND TO BE TALKING ABOUT FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHY LIGHTING
g8qogDYpMGI_2 NOW A FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHY CAN BE ANYWHERE FROM A CRIME SCENE TO INSIDE A MEDICAL EXAMINERS LAUGH
g8qogDYpMGI_3 THEY ARE LIGHTING IS VERY EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU'RE REALLY PRESENTING FACTS
g8qogDYpMGI_4 ONE TYPE OF FLASH THAT I HAVE USED IN SOME TYPES OF FRIENDS A PHOTOGRAPHY IS A RING FLASH
g8qogDYpMGI_5 AS THE FLASH THAT ACTUALLY GOES ON THE LENS OF MY CAMERA AND IT'S EXTREMELY CLOSE TO WHAT I'M SHOOTING
g8qogDYpMGI_6 OUR SHOOTING WHAT'S A HAIR OR SOME TYPE OF EVIDENCE AND SOME OF THESE HAND WOULD WANT THAT RING FLASH THIS IS THE DIRECTLY HIT WHAT I'M PHOTOGRAPHING
g8qogDYpMGI_7 IF I WAS USING A FLASH THOSE AMOUNT ON TOP OF MY CAMERA LESS WAS HAND HELD WOULD BE SORT OF DIFFICULT
g8qogDYpMGI_8 SO RING FLASH IS TYPE OF LIGHTING THAT YOU REALLY LIKE TO USE FOR FORENSIC TOP COMFY
g8qogDYpMGI_9 ONE ALSO TYPE OF LIGHTING THAT YOU CAN USE JUST STILL LIGHTS
g8qogDYpMGI_10 MOST THE TIME THEY'RE NOT IS BECAUSE FRIENDS OF PHOTOGRAPHY REALLY TYPE OF LIGHTING YOU WANT TO USE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS HEAT BASED
g8qogDYpMGI_11 HE WOULD NOT BE GOOD TO USE IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT
g8qogDYpMGI_12 SHE REALLY WANTS TO WITH A MORE ARTIFICIAL FLASH TYPE FOR FOR AND TAMPED
g8qogDYpMGI_13 THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TYPES OF LIGHTING THAT I USE A FORENSIC TOP
GCcBxa4jyGU_1 IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON BOTH THE POOR AND TWISTING

HGau-Xi6D_k_2 OF ONE THING THIS AGAIN IS BENCHES OR MAYBE EVEN OF WITH LOTS OF SMALL THING TABLES THAT YOU CAN JUMP OF ONTO OLLIE UP ONTO IT
HGau-Xi6D_k_3 THIS ONE HERE IS A GOOD NEXT HEIGHT
HGau-Xi6D_k_4 IF NOT MAKE SURE THAT YOU COULD HOLLY AS HIGH AS THE AS A SPOT IS OF PRACTICE DOING A BUNCH OF OLLIES OF WANTS TO HAVE AN AND GET THAT AND GET THAT PERFECT
HGau-Xi6D_k_5 WHEN YOU WANT TO OLLIE UP INTO THE MANUAL PHYSICIAN
HGau-Xi6D_k_6 THROW IT IN AN OLD
HGau-Xi6D_k_7 KEEP YOUR FEET IN A NICE GENERAL POSITION WITH IN IT AND USE YOUR UPPER BODY OF FOOD SHOTS AND HOLD OF ANGLE FOR THE WHOLE DISTANCE OF THE OF THE TOP OF THE FAT OFF OF
HGau-Xi6D_k_8 ONCE YOU GET THAT DOWN MANUALING OR YOU CAN MAYBE EVEN LEARN HOW TO OFF PERFECT THIS SMALL LEAF OUT OF THEM AND WITH THE ENDS OFF WHERE YOU JUST CLOSED OFF THE ENDS AND RIGHT AWAY FROM THE HALF OFF
HGau-Xi6D_k_9 SO IF YOU HOLLY IF IT'S EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT OLLIE INTO THE HEIGHT THAT YOU HALF
HGau-Xi6D_k_10 OLLIE UP ONCE OFF
HGau-Xi6D_k_11 LAND IN A MANUAL
HGau-Xi6D_k_12 FOLD THE MANUAL
HGau-Xi6D_k_13 I JUST FROM THE WAY THINK AND A VOLLEY OUT LENGTH OF SOUTH HAVE
gA8_Za3kOHk_1 THE NEXT THAT WE'VE BEEN ROLLING IN SQUISHING
gA8_Za3kOHk_2 I'VE ENDED FOR ABOUT TWO OR THREE MINUTES
gA8_Za3kOHk_3 NOT VERY LONG
gA8_Za3kOHk_4 I'VE GOT PLENTY OF SOAP AND WATER DISH IN ALL OF THE PLAY SO I KNOW I HAVEN'T OF THE FINAL HAVEN'T OF WATER
gA8_Za3kOHk_5 ON AN UNROLL LIVE AND WE'RE GOING TO WE ROLL IN THE DIRECTION OF PROCESS WE CAN FIX ARE EDGES IT CAN THEY USUALLY GO A LITTLE BIT READY THIS THING
gA8_Za3kOHk_6 SO WHAT I'VE GOT ONE OF THE IS MURKY IN MY TRAY AND GETTING WATER ALL OF A <UNK>
gA8_Za3kOHk_7 AND THEN A FRYING MY END
gA8_Za3kOHk_8 IN WARM AND WANTS TO STICK TO THE BUBBLE WRAP THEM IN A WIG ON VERY CAREFULLY
gA8_Za3kOHk_9 THE FELL IS STARTING TO FORM BUT WE'RE REALLY STILL WORKING WITH HIS OF AND OF WHAT THE AS THAT
gA8_Za3kOHk_10 SO THE WAY YOU CAN DO THIS POINT IS AN OF GOLD IN ANY PARTS THAT ARE HANGING OUT OF THE END THAT YOU MAY WANT TO BRING BACK INTO A BUBBLE WRAP ROLL
gA8_Za3kOHk_11 ANY ENDS THAT ARE UNEVEN
gA8_Za3kOHk_12 AND THEN THEY WORK MY WAY DOWN AND IN A ROLL IT ON THERE ARE A LITTLE TIGHTER THIS TIME
gA8_Za3kOHk_13 AND KEEP EVERYTHING TOGETHER
gA8_Za3kOHk_14 AND AS A ROLL UP I CAN KEEP GOING
gA8_Za3kOHk_15 EXAM AND IS AS I GO UP
gA8_Za3kOHk_16 AND THEN TIE IT BACK UP AGAIN IN IN THE JELLY WILL
gA8_Za3kOHk_17 AND I'VE GOT THE OTHER END ON THE INSIDE NOW
gA8_Za3kOHk_18 AND WHEN I'M SQUISH IT AN WILL PROVIDE ANOTHER FIVE
gj_clsvISbo_1 OKAY SOMETIMES IN SLOSH YOUR OPPONENT FOR TWO HUNDRED REFRESHER AND SO AS WE SHOWN YOU TRADITIONAL OUT BACK AND DROP SHOT WILL BE SOMEWHAT LIKE I'M UNIQUE MONSTER OF OR MANY FOLLOWING THE LIKE THAT
gj_clsvISbo_2 BUT IF YOU'RE IF YOU'VE GOT MAKE ALONG WRONG OUR OPPONENT IN EXCELLENTLY A WILD OF EXECUTED SCHUFF ODD YOU HAVE TO DO ON WHAT I CALL SOMEWHAT OF A FENCING CHEF
gj_clsvISbo_3 SO IF YOU HAVE YOUR RACKET LIKE PATH AND WOULD SAY SOMEBODY STUNTS

gj_clsvISbo_7 IN THE SAME GOES FOR THE FOREHAND SIDE SO INSTEAD OF THIS ON THE GUARD IT'S LIKE THAT
gj_clsvISbo_8 SO THIN OPPONENT HITS A THIRTY GOOD SHOT IF THESE IS THE I HIT THE BACK OF THE I'M NOT DOING LIKE A DROP SHOT AND MORE TRADITIONAL ONE I GET A RECORD OF AND IS USING THE STRENGTH IN HIS BLOCKING THE BALL SO JUST OF LIGHT ABOVE THE TEN
gj_clsvISbo_9 SO IT'S JUST LIKE THE F SEVEN RATE IS A REALLY AFFECT THE SHOT FROM ONE HUNDRED RIGHT FRESH
gj_clsvISbo_10 AND DOWN YOU CAN ALSO ADD A LOT OPTION TO EITHER ONE OF THE SHOT WHICH WILL EXPLAIN A DIFFERENT THAN A SEGMENT
gj_clsvISbo_11 BUT YOU GET THEM ON KING AND PUSH A LOT WHEN HE STILL ALL THE WAY ON EITHER SIDE HIM LAUNCHES IS VERY EFFECTIVE SHOT FOR TRYING THE TABLES AND PHONE

guRLm8Foh6w_2 WE'RE IN AND TALK ABOUT THE SAFETY OF TOOTH WHITENING PRODUCTS
guRLm8Foh6w_3 DID THE GREATEST WRIST IN TOOTH WHITENING PRODUCT YEARS IS OF CREATING HYPERSENSITIVE TOO
guRLm8Foh6w_4 PEOPLE A HABIT HISTORY OF HYPERSENSITIVE NEED IT'S ALL THAT ISSUE BEFORE THEY USE IN THE RAW HOME BLEACHING PRODUCTS ESPECIALLY HOME PRODUCTS THAT ARE HARD TO CONTROL

guRLm8Foh6w_6 BLEACH DOES NOT AFFECT THE STRENGTH OF THE TO IS THAT IF YOU HAVE A HYPERSENSITIVE TO IT BECAUSE THE ENAMEL IS VERY THING ON OR YOU HAVE EXPOSE RIDGE DRAWERS STRUCTURE OF THE THE LEACH AGAIN SO STRUCTURES WILL CAUSE THAT HARDY HYPERSENSITIVE TO TO REACT IN INFLAME EVEN MORE
guRLm8Foh6w_7 IF YOU DO HAVE SENSITIVITY THEREFORE ADDS ANOTHER DESENSITIZING AGENTS THAT ARE MADE TO SUIT THAT IS HOW YOU CAN USE YOUR BLEACH LESS OFTEN THE EDUCATED NEW OR A HYPERSENSITIVE TUNE
guRLm8Foh6w_8 IN TERMS OF LONGEVITY OF BLEACHING PRODUCTS AFTER THE INITIAL BLEACHING PHASE WHICH CAN LAST UP TO THREE WEEKS AND I THERE IS NO DATA ON ANYONE WHO USES BLEACHING PRODUCTS FOR TOUCH UP MORE OFTEN THAN ONCE A MONTH A NINE

h35T7XMLKrY_13 ALL YOU'RE DOING A STIR YOUR WRIST OVER LIKE THAT BACK AND FORTH LEAVES HAVE TO GET YOUR FINGERS CONTROL THE THROW IT CORRECTLY
h35T7XMLKrY_14 AGAIN THESE ARE CLOCK CATCHES
h35T7XMLKrY_15 PRETTY GOOD VISUAL TRICK PEOPLE CAN REALLY SEE THE DIFFERENCE AND A ON THE INTERNET AND GROWING IN THEIR SOMETHING LIKE THAT MAKE PEOPLE REALLY LIKE THE TRICK
G4CzvKfH9AE_1 NOW THE OPPOSITE OF THE HAMMER ON IS A PULL OFF
G4CzvKfH9AE_2 IN THE LAST CLIP WE NOTED THAT A HAMMER OF MEANT YOU GOING TO PLAY AN O CLOCK IN DRIVE YOUR FINGER OF YOUR FRETTING HAND INTO THE FRET BOARD AND THE FORCE OF YOUR FINGER IN THE STRING MAKING CONTACT WITH THE FRET YOUR WILL ALLOW THAT NEXT NOTE THE SECOND NOTE TO RING OUT
G4CzvKfH9AE_3 RATHER THEN PICKING THE NOTE TWICE WE'D HAVE OH NO PULL OFF IS JUST THE OPPOSITE
G4CzvKfH9AE_4 WE'RE IN A START WITH A NOTE AND RATHER THAN PICKING THE SECOND NOTRE WE'RE GOING TO PICK THE FIRST NOTE IN THE POOL THE FINGER OFF OF THE STRING DOWN AND AWAY FROM THE STRING
G4CzvKfH9AE_5 SO THE INSTEAD OF KICKING WITH THE RIGHT HAND ESSENTIALLY YOU JUST GRIPPING THE STRING WITH YOUR FRET AND FINGER AND PULLING IT BACK ALLOWING THAT STRING TO RING HALF
G4CzvKfH9AE_6 NOW AGAIN YOU CAN DO THAT TO AN OPEN STRING WARRANT YOU CAN KEEP A FINGER FRETTED AND PLAY AND MOVE THE DOUBLE PULL OFF TO THAT NOW
GdSH7P6cZEc_1 AND NEXT TECHNIQUE REVENGE ZOOM IS ADDING HERE
GdSH7P6cZEc_2 SO WHAT OURS WOULD JUNE ADDING HERE TO A BASIC THREE STRAND BREAK
GdSH7P6cZEc_3 SO ONTO ANOTHER OR CORDING LIKE THIS
GdSH7P6cZEc_4 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU CHEAT THE HERE CLIP AWAY FROM THE SECTION THAT ARE WORKING ON SO THAT YOU DON'T GET HERE ON CAUGHT UP IN SECTION THAT WHILE I'M WORKING ON
GdSH7P6cZEc_5 FIRST THING TO DO IS GONNA ADD A PIECE OF HAIR
GdSH7P6cZEc_6 SO STILL THE SAME TECHNIQUE
GdSH7P6cZEc_7 YOU STILL START WITH THE THREE PIECES
GdSH7P6cZEc_8 BUT FIRST WHICH YOU WANT TO DO IS WRAP THE HERE OR ROUND PUSHING IT AS CLOSE TO THE BASE HOLDING IS CLOSE TO THE BASE AS POSSIBLE
GdSH7P6cZEc_9 ONE HOLE THERE HERE BETWEEN YOUR FOREFINGER YOU DOWN
GdSH7P6cZEc_10 THEN YOU WANT TO SECTION IS THAT THE HERE THE TO A
GdSH7P6cZEc_11 DO ONE AT A SMALL PIECE INTO THEIR HERE SO THAT YOU HAVE IT THREE STRANDS JUST LIKE A REGULAR PERIPHERY
GdSH7P6cZEc_12 IN ONE AND CONTINUE WITH THE SAME TAKE THE
GdSH7P6cZEc_13 TAKE THE LEFT SIDE BRING IT TO THE MIDDLE
GdSH7P6cZEc_14 BRING THE MIDDLE TO THE LEFT
GdSH7P6cZEc_15 THERE YOU GO
GdSH7P6cZEc_16 IN A TAKE THE RIGHT SIDE BRING INTO THE MIDDLE
GdSH7P6cZEc_17 VIDEO TO THE RIGHT
GdSH7P6cZEc_18 SAME THING THAT TECHNIQUE WHICH ARE HOLDING THE HERE IS CLOSE TO THE SCOUT IS HOSPITAL SO THAT THE SYNTHETIC HAIR THAT YOU ADD IT THIS MASS LIE
GdSH7P6cZEc_19 SO MOVING ALL THAT HERE SO YOU CAN MAKE IT ALL LAND
GdSH7P6cZEc_20 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE WHEN I AM HERE THE SHEEN WRAP THAT HERE TIGHTLY AROUND YOUR FINGER SO THAT IT STAYS FLAT
GdSH7P6cZEc_21 USING YOUR FINGER UNDERNEATH AS A BASE SO THAT THE BRAID DOESN'T MOVE IN SPACE FLAT
GdSH7P6cZEc_22 THE FINGER UNDER THE RATE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS TAKE ME BECAUSE IT HELPS TO KEEP THE BRAKE CONSISTENT
GdSH7P6cZEc_23 AND IT GIVES IT A GOOD BASE AND FOUNDATION
GdSH7P6cZEc_24 AND IT ALSO ON CONTROLS THE TIGHTNESS OF THE BRAID
GdSH7P6cZEc_25 SO MISTAKEN OF A OF A WRAPPING BITS BEHIND IT IN AN A ROUND MY FINGER TIGHTLY IS MAKING THE BRAID ACTUALLY THEY'VE HIS HI
GdSH7P6cZEc_26 CUT THAT I DIDN'T DO THAT ARE CAGES DO THIS AND JUST GRAB THE STRANDS LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE DO
GdSH7P6cZEc_27 AND LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE BRAID
GdSH7P6cZEc_28 IT GIVES YOU A MUCH LOOSE OR A WOOD SOMETIMES IS GOODS THAT YOU WANT MOVES BRAIDS
GdSH7P6cZEc_29 BUT LOOK AT OUR OF THE EXCESS HERE THAT LEAVES OUT WHEN YOU KNACK WRAPPING NEW JESTS BRAIDING
GdSH7P6cZEc_30 ESPECIALLY WHEN HERE IS A
GdSH7P6cZEc_31 SO ONE WRAP WRAP WRAP RAT ALMOST AS IF YOU'RE PUSHING IT UP AND BEHIND HER WHEN HER
GdSH7P6cZEc_32 IT GIVES YOU A MUCH TIGHTER BREAK
GdSH7P6cZEc_33 BUT SOMETIMES YOU JUST WANT A LOOSE VERY <UNK> IS IN THE SAME TECHNIQUE
GdSH7P6cZEc_34 YOU JUST DON'T WRAP IS TIGHT
GdSH7P6cZEc_35 AND THIS IS HOW YOU DO EXTENSIONS
GdSH7P6cZEc_36 EXTEND THE HERE BY ADDING AND IS REALLY HITTING
GdSH7P6cZEc_37 THEY'RE YOUR

gqkc-eW6Qo4_22 WHEN THEY'RE DEMONSTRATING THE RIGHT WAY HOW TO DO AN EXERCISE THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY MAKE A CLEAR WITH OUR CLIENT THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING BEFORE THE CLIENT GOES OUT THERE AND PERFORM THE EXERCISE
gqkc-eW6Qo4_23 AND IN EFFECTIVE MAT THEY'D ON EXAMPLE FOR A TRAINER WOULD BE TO DO THAT EXERCISE WITH THEM

GxkICAM1cqg_2 MY NAME'S ALLEN FOR EXPERT VILLAGE
GxkICAM1cqg_3 AND TODAY I'M GOING TO DISCUSS THE CONTROVERSIAL AND BANNED ALCOHOL COMMONLY KNOWN AS ABSINTHE
GxkICAM1cqg_4 SO ANYTHING ABSINTHE THE NUMBER ONE INGREDIENT EVERYONE THINKS OF WHERE THE NUMBER ONE EFFECT REALLY THEREBY THINGS OF IS THE HALLUCINATION THAT EVERYBODY REALLY PUT TOGETHER WITH ABSINTHE WATER BUT HERE IS ABOUT
GxkICAM1cqg_5 WELL THAT INGREDIENT IS WORMWOOD AND THAT'S REALLY THE REASON WHY IT HAS BEEN BAND HERE IN THE NIGHT STATES AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES BUT A LOT OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE BRINGING IT BACK
GxkICAM1cqg_6 BECAUSE THEY'RE FINE UNLESS EFFECTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WE'RE TAKING DIFFERENT PROCESSES TO BREW IT WITH OUT THE I'VE TOXINS THAN A NORMAL TOXINS THAT COME FROM WORMWOOD THAT REALLY GIVE THESE HALLUCINOGENIC AFFECTS OUR SIDE EFFECTS TO THE DRINK
GxkICAM1cqg_7 NOW IF YOU GO IN THE FDA WEBSITE WILL RIDGELY BAND THE ABSENT PRODUCT CONTAINING WORMWOOD YOU'LL SEE IN THE POSSIBLE HEALTH HAZARDS
GxkICAM1cqg_8 IT SAYS NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS CHARACTERIZED BY AN ODD NUMBERS OF LEGS IN ARMS LOSS OF INTELLECT DELIRIUM AND PARALYSIS
GxkICAM1cqg_9 NOW THIS IS PROBABLY A FEW CONSUME TONS AND TONS OF THIS DRINK
GxkICAM1cqg_10 AND CONSUMED ON A VERY MY NEW OF ARE VERY MINIMAL LEVEL AND YOU KNOW A CONTROL LEVEL THAT IT'S REALLY NOT AND HAVE TOO MUCH OF AN EFFECT ON YOU
GxkICAM1cqg_11 SOMETIMES YES YOU'LL DEADLY FEEL A LITTLE BIT OF A AUBURN DELIVERING EFFECT WHICH I HAVE IN ENCOUNTER A FEW TIMES DRINKING THIS BUT YOU REALLY JUST BE SAKE ABOUT IT
GxkICAM1cqg_12 NOW WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK INTO WARM WOULD WHITE DOESN'T AS WELL IT CONTAINS OF YOU BELIEVE IT HOLD OF FOOT ON I'M NOT REALLY SURE THAT'S THE CORRECT PRONUNCIATION BUT IT'S A CHEMICAL VERY CLOSE TO WHAT'S IN OUR WANT AN HONEST TH SEE
GxkICAM1cqg_13 AND SINCE THAT AND THE FDA IS PLACED ON THE WARM WILL AN HERB IN THE ON STAGE CATEGORY
GxkICAM1cqg_14 AND IT'S BEEN REPORTED ADD THIS CHEMICAL IN THE WORMWOOD BECAUSE THE NERVE DAMAGE ANOTHER SIDE EFFECTS
GxkICAM1cqg_15 SO IF YOU REALLY WANT A SLING KID OR OR USE WORMWOOD PRODUCTS WHICH IS THE YOU KNOW READILY EASILY TO FIND OUT MAYBE YOU CONSULT WITH A MEDICAL PHYSICIAN FIRST
GxkICAM1cqg_16 BUT REALLY IF YOU DO IT ON A ON OF BEES IS SHORTER INTERVIEWED CONSUME IT ON THE SMART LEVEL YOU'RE NOT REALLY RUN INTO ANY POTENTIAL PROBLEMS
GeQZoFEa-aM_1 THE MARINE ORGANISM WE'RE GOING TO IDENTIFY NOW IS THE LONG FIN DAMSEL FISH
GeQZoFEa-aM_2 ONE OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE FISH ON THE CORAL REEF IS THE
GeQZoFEa-aM_3 DAMSEL FISH ALONG FOR DANCE A FISH IS ONE OF THE LESS COMMON DAMSEL FISH SPECIES
GeQZoFEa-aM_4 A RELATIVELY LARGE CHANCE OF FISH USUALLY THREE TO FOUR INCHES LONG ALTHOUGH THEY CAN REACH A MAXIMUM SIZE OF FIVE INCHES
GeQZoFEa-aM_5 ALONG FIN DAMPS OFFICIAL DEFENDERS TERRITORY VERY AGGRESSIVELY
GeQZoFEa-aM_6 THE CHARACTER AND GENERALLY ONLY COVERS A SMALL AREA FOR EXAMPLE A SMALL CORAL HEAD IN THE SAND BUT THEY WILL ATTACKED ANYTHING THAT GETS TOO CLOSE TO IT INCLUDING FISH MUCH LARGER THAN ITSELF
GeQZoFEa-aM_7 LONG FIN DAMS A FISH ARE SOMEWHAT CHALLENGING TO IDENTIFY SINCE THEY CAN BE EASILY CONFUSED WITH THE DUST THE DANCE <UNK>
GeQZoFEa-aM_8 WHAT DISTINGUISHES THE TWO SPECIES ARE THE SHAPE AND LENGTHEN THEIR DORSAL IN ANAL FINS
GeQZoFEa-aM_9 ONE FIN DANCE A FISH HAVE DORSAL AND ANAL FINS THAT EXTEND WELL BE ON THE BASS THE TAIL AND USE THEY ARE MORE POINTED THAN ROUNDED
GeQZoFEa-aM_10 WHERE IS THE DUST AGAINST A FISH FINS AND JUST AT OR JUST PAST THE BASE OF THE TAIL AND AROUND
GeQZoFEa-aM_11 THE COLORATION OF LONG CONDENSE OF FISH IS A DARK BROWN TO BLACK OVERS ENTIRE BODY IN FINS
GeQZoFEa-aM_12 ALTHOUGH THE PECTORAL FINS MAY APPEAR TO BE CLEAR
GeQZoFEa-aM_13 GIVE IT I LONG FIN DANCING FISH ARE VERY DIFFERENT LOOK
GeQZoFEa-aM_14 THEY HAVE BRIGHT YELLOW BODIES WITH BRIGHT BLUE LINES THAT STARTED THE NOSE AND RUN ALONG THE BACK OFTEN BREAKING THE SLOTS INSTEAD OF A CONTINUOUS LINE
GeQZoFEa-aM_15 THEY'RE DISTINGUISH FROM THEIR OTHER SIMILARLY COLOR DAMS OF FISH JUVENILES BY A DARK SPOT RANGE IN BLUE ON THEIR DORSAL FIN
GeQZoFEa-aM_16 ONE THING DANCE FISH CAN BE FOUND THROUGHOUT THE CARIBBEAN AND FLORIDA KEYS
GeQZoFEa-aM_17 BUT OR LESS COMMON THAN OTHER SPECIES OF DAMSEL FISH SUCH AS THE BY COLOR DAMSEL FISH
GeQZoFEa-aM_18 THEY CAN BE FOUND IT GETS RANGING FROM A FEW FEET CADETS WHILE BEYOND SAFE DIVING LIMITS FOR RECREATIONAL SCUBA DIVERS
GeQZoFEa-aM_19 ALTHOUGH THEY'RE MOST COMMONLY FOUND ADAPTS OF LESSON EIGHTY FEET
GeQZoFEa-aM_20 NEVER RELATIVELY SMALL TERRITORY THEY PATROL AND RARELY RISE MORE THAN A FEW INCHES ABOVE THE SAFETY OF THEIR PATCH REEF OR CORAL HEAD
GeQZoFEa-aM_21 IF IT FEELS THREATENED THEY WILL QUICKLY DIAGONAL HOLE IN THE REEF BUT WILL FAIRLY QUICKLY
GeQZoFEa-aM_22 <UNK> REEMERGE LONG FIN DAMS A FISH LIKE ALL DANCING FISH FEED PRIMARILY ON ALGAE AND THEY TEND TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN PERSONAL ALGAE PATCH IN THEIR TERRITORY
GeQZoFEa-aM_23 LONG FAN DAMSEL FISH ALSO REPORTEDLY FEED ON VARIOUS WORMS HEIGHT GROINS SO PLANKTON AND
GeQZoFEa-aM_24 TUNIC ITS LIFE AND DANCE A FISH EXIST AS SEPARATE MALE AND FEMALE SPECIMENS
GeQZoFEa-aM_25 ALTHOUGH THE COLOR PATTERNS DO NOT DIFFER
GeQZoFEa-aM_26 EGGS ARE LAID BY THE FEMALE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE REEF AND THEN THE MALE SWIMS OVER THEM TO FERTILIZE THEM
GeQZoFEa-aM_27 ONCE FERTILIZE THE MALE LONG FIN DANCE A FISH GUARDS THE ACE UNTIL THEY HATCH IT WILL BE MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN NORMAL IT PROTECTING THE AREA AROUND THE EGGS
GeQZoFEa-aM_28 ONCE HASH THE FRYER ON THEIR OWN
GeQZoFEa-aM_29 THAT'S THE LONG FIN VANCIL FRESH
GIaxLnYH858_1 ALRIGHT IN THIS SECTION ON A TALK ABOUT THE NEXT STEP OF CREATING A CHORD PROGRESSION
GIaxLnYH858_2 AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE LYRICS DAD IF YOU IT HAD IT TOGETHER I WOULDN'T BE OUT HERE SO COLD AND ALONE

gedjAg79VKQ_4 I START LEARNING CLOSE AT HAND THAT LIVE FOR THE FIRST TWO BEATS UNTIL A FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO
gedjAg79VKQ_5 NOW IF YOU DIDN'T JUST BEND AND COMING BACK YOU WANT ARE HOLDING IT TOO FAR OUT ON THE CLUB
gedjAg79VKQ_6 NOW ON IT SHOULD GET AS CLOSE TO THE CENTER VOWELS POSSUM HOLD IT
gedjAg79VKQ_7 AND THOSE LITTLE AWKWARD WITH TWO WHEN IT'S MUCH EASIER LIMIT HERE THE JOB A LOT LESS CONTROLLED MANNER WITH AND CENTER BOUNCE

gedjAg79VKQ_9 AS THE OLD GET IN TROUBLE WITH THE HIGHER NUMBERS THEN MOVE THAT WHEN THE FORM IT SHOULD HAVE MASTERED WITH BOTH HANDS DON'T KNOWN IF IT HERE GO
gedjAg79VKQ_10 IF YOU'RE RUNNING AFTER THE BALLS RAFTING CLOVES MADE SURE THAT DON'T WANT ANY CRACKS IN FRONT OF A LITTLE THAT'S WHERE THE IN THAT USUALLY KICKER
hJ_DMggaOS4_1 JUST ABOUT ANY HORSE THAT'S NOT AFRAID OF A COUCH CAN BE SOMEWHAT HELPFUL IN LEARNING HOW TO READ IN TRACK OUTS
hJ_DMggaOS4_2 BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION IN OUR SPORT WE REALLY APPRECIATE WE CAN COME UPON AND PURCHASE ONE THAT HAS THE GOOD READING AND THE COW SENSE OR IN OTHER WORDS IS VERY COW WEEK
hJ_DMggaOS4_3 WHERE A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE CUTTING WORLD WHERE IT'S ALL ABOUT STYLE IN BEING JUST WHICH WE APPRECIATE INTO OUR BASS TO ENSURE IF THE DARK OUR CUTTING HORSES MAINTAIN A LOT OF THOSE QUALITIES
hJ_DMggaOS4_4 SO WE LOOK FOR IS OF COURSE THIS VERY BOLD AND BRAVE AND NOT THEN OR THE INTIMIDATED BY THE CHALLENGE OF A STRONG COW
hJ_DMggaOS4_5 SO OUR COW WE'RE STILL NEEDS TO BE THAT QUICK AND TURNING ON THE HIND BUT ALSO IS ALLOWED TO GET A LITTLE MORE AGGRESSIVE A LITTLE BIT FASTER IN ITS EFFORTS TO CONTROL THAT COW
hJ_DMggaOS4_6 SO WE'RE ABOUT TO MARK ON LEARNING MORE ABOUT HOW WE PUT THIS GOOD COUNT WORST WORTH AGAINST THE TIME CLOCK WITH THE SIXTY SECOND CLOCK OF OUR TEAM PENNING AND RANCH SORTING SPORT
hJ_DMggaOS4_7 YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS HORSE HAS THAT INHERENT QUALITY THAT I SAY KIND OF PRESENTS SIMILAR TO A POLICEMAN WITH TWO LOADED GUNS FEELING TO THAT COW
hJ_DMggaOS4_8 ANOTHER WORSE WITHOUT THAT COW UNITS THAT QUICK FOOTED MOVEMENT THAT MATCHES AND HERE'S THE COUNTS MOVEMENT ANOTHER HORSE MIGHT NOT PERFORM QUITE TO THE DETAIL THAT WE NEED IT TO
hJ_DMggaOS4_9 SO WE FIRST OR AT GO OUT AND TRY TO ACHIEVE THE PURCHASE OF A GOOD CALVE WARS KEEP THOSE COW SKILLS TO ALIVE KEEP WORK IN A MOMENT OUT BUT WE ALSO LET HIM GET JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE IN THEIR EFFORTS TO CHALLENGE THOSE COW MOVES WE NEED I'M A PUB AT THE BRAND OF A SECOND

gl6NxbWoQFk_7 THE UNIQUE THOSE THINGS
gl6NxbWoQFk_8 IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING WITH IN A CIRCLE YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO NEED A COMPASS AND TO CONTROL IT YOUR GRID YOU'RE USUALLY GOING TO WANT TO USE A LIGHTWEIGHT PENCIL

GFJOtXf7z8c_1 WHEN YOU PICK UP PRODUCTS THAT YOU INVESTIGATING THE INGREDIENTS FOR ANY START READING THE LABELS YOU FIND AN INCREDIBLY LONG LIST OF CHEMICALS
GFJOtXf7z8c_2 MOST OF THESE ARE TO INCREASE THE FUNNY ACTION TO INCREASE THE PRESERVATIVE CAPABILITIES BECAUSE OF THESE MOST OF THESE PERSON CARE PRODUCTS ARE MADE IN HUGE BATCHES AND THEY NEED TO BE SHIP TOO FAR DESTINATIONS AND ARE ALL KINDS OF TEMPERATURES SAUT
GFJOtXf7z8c_3 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL START TO FIND IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INGREDIENTS YOU'LL FIND ON THINGS LIKE SODIUM LAUREL SULFATE
GFJOtXf7z8c_4 THIS IS A FOAMING ACTION IT'S BEEN PROVEN LIGHTLY TO BE HIGHLY TOXIC
GFJOtXf7z8c_5 YOU FIND OTHER INGREDIENTS THAT ARE FOUND IN THE OVEN CLEANERS IN CAR WASHES END ON ESPECIALLY PETROLEUM DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS
GFJOtXf7z8c_6 ON PUDDLING GLYCOL IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY FOUND INGREDIENTS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS AND IT'S A TRASH INGREDIENT FROM OIL FROM PETROLEUM
GFJOtXf7z8c_7 SO LEARN HOW TO READ YOUR INGREDIENTS
GFJOtXf7z8c_8 INVESTIGATE THE INGREDIENTS FIND OUT WHERE THEY COME FROM
GFJOtXf7z8c_9 SEE IF THEY'RE ON YOUR PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS
GFJOtXf7z8c_10 WE DON'T WANT THEM ABSORBING INTO YOUR SKIN
GFJOtXf7z8c_11 THE MOST SAFE SHORT INGREDIENTS ARE PLANT OILS
GFJOtXf7z8c_12 FOR INSTANCE THIS WOOD IS COMPRISED OF ROSEWOOD OIL AND SWEET ORANGE BOILED
GFJOtXf7z8c_13 THIS ONE HAS LOTUS LEAF OIL
GFJOtXf7z8c_14 WHEELS ARE INCREDIBLY MOISTURIZING

GFJOtXf7z8c_16 HERE WE ARE IN THE HEAT OF THE SUMMER AND WE'VE BEEN HEATING THAT THEY'RE MATALA JUST WARNINGS IN THE SKIN CANCER EXPERTS WARNING ABOUT USING SUNSCREEN
GFJOtXf7z8c_17 BUT I THINK WHAT THEY'RE SHOWING NOW IS THAT YOU NEED TO READ THE LABELS ON YOUR SUNSCREEN PRODUCTS
GFJOtXf7z8c_18 THIS IS A SUNSCREEN THAT CONTAINS MOSTLY ZINC OXIDE
GFJOtXf7z8c_19 IT'S A SHOE OR MINERAL IT'S A REFLECTOR WHICH MEANS IT WILL BOUNCE BACK THE HARMFUL UV RAYS THAT WERE SO CONCERNED WITH
GFJOtXf7z8c_20 IT IT CONTAINS OF SKIN SOOTHING INGREDIENT CAUGHT LAVENDER
GFJOtXf7z8c_21 LAVENDER ESSENTIAL OIL WHICH IS AN INCREDIBLY FEWER PRODUCT THIS IS A DAILY SKIN MOISTURIZER
GFJOtXf7z8c_22 THE SPF OF THIS IT IS EIGHTEEN
